fifty
years

the
first
great
achievement

kind
was
morse
improvement
of
the
electric

that
morse
joseph
henry
chiefly
prepared
the
way
for
that
triumph
the
following
account
with
just
emphasis
demonstrates
among
the
european
scientists
and
inventors
to
whom
both
henry
and
morse
were
indebted
was
the
french
electrician
andré
marie
ampère
whose
name
ampère
has
been
given
to
the
practical
unit
of
strength
ampère
was
the
first
and
is
the
most
famous
investigator
in
electrodynamics
he
also
invented
a
telegraphic
arrangement
in
which
he
used
the
magnetic
needle
and
coil
and
the
galvanic
battery
others
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
earlier
years
of
the
nineteenth
devised
similar
arrangements
but
no
strictly
electromagnetic
apparatus
for
telegraphic
signalling
was
put
to
successful
use
until
when
in
england
charles
wheatstone
who
is
commonly
regarded
as
the
first
inventor
of
practical
electric
telegraphy
constructed
an
apparatus
whereby
thirty
signals
were
transmitted
through
nearly
four
miles
of
wire
from
to
he
had
as
an
associate
william
fothergill
cooke
and
the
two
worked
together
to
develop
the
electric
telegraph
they
afterward
quarrelled
over
their
respective
claims
to
credit
but
in
telegraph
lines
secured
by
their
patents
were
set
up
on
the
great
western
and
two
other
english
railways
meanwhile
other
inventors
were
still
working
for
the
same
results
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
it
has
been
significantly
said
that
the
electric
telegraph
had
properly
speaking
no
inventor
it
grew
up
little
by
little
nevertheless
with
respect
to
the
distinctive
character
of
morse
improvements
and
his
title
to
a
peculiar
place
among
those
through
whose
labors
the
electric
telegraph
grew

can
be
no
question
alonzo
cornell
son
of
the
founder
of
cornell
university
at
one
time
governor
of
new
york
was
intimately
connected
with
electrical
and
telegraphic
affairs
for
many
years
therefore
on
the
subject
here
presented
he
speaks
with
professional
authority
his
father
was
the
first
builder
of
the
morse
telegraphs
during
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
slight
advance
was
made
in
the
development
of
electrical
science
although
there
were
many
persons
both
here
and
abroad
engaged
in
experimental
work
and
there
was
considerable
increase
of
literature
bearing
upon
the
subject
it
was
reserved
for
another
illustrious
american
to
accomplish
the
next
important
and
decisive
step
in
the
pathway
of
progress
in
joseph
henry
then
professor
of
physics
at
the
albany
academy
afterward
a
professor
at
princeton
and
subsequently
for
many
years
secretary
of
the
smithsonian
institution
at
washington
made
the
highly
important
discovery
that
by
winding
a
plain
iron
core
with
many
layers
of
insulated
wire
through
which
the
electric
current
was
passed
he
could
at
pleasure
charge
and
discharge
the
iron
core
with
magnetic
power
thus
henry
produced
the
electromagnet
which
was
the
beginning
of
the
mastery
by
man
of
the
subtle
fluid
he
also
discovered
that
the
intensity
and
power
of
the
electric
current
were
materially
augmented
by
increasing
the
number
of
the
series
of
battery
plates
without
increasing
the
quantity
of
metal
used
in
their
construction
these
discoveries
of
henry
were
beyond
all
question
the
most
important
in
real
and
intrinsic
value
ever
made
in
the
progress
of
electric
science
as
they
form
the
solid
basis
upon
which
all
subsequent
inventors
have
been
enabled
to
accomplish
successful
results
in
their
various
fields
of
endeavor
it
is
conceded
by
all
familiar
with
the
history
of
electrical
progress
that
the
name
of
professor
joseph
henry
is
to
be
honored
and
cherished
as
one
of
the
very
foremost
of
scientific
discoverers
of
any
age
or
country
and
it
must
remain
a
cause
of
sincere
and
permanent
regret
that
of
all
the
fabulous
wealth
that
has
resulted
from
the
advancement
of
electrical
science
this
modest
and
unselfish
inventor
should
have
passed
hence
without
ever
having
realized
any
substantial
reward
for
his
great
work
not
only
so
but
he
was
never
awarded
the
appropriate
acknowledgment
to
which
he
was
so
eminently
entitled
for
the
inestimable
benefits
his
discoveries
conferred

his
countrymen

of
life
for
many
years
after
the

heroic
struggle

himself
compelled
to
seek
the
aid

from
the
committee
on
commerce
but
made
no
further
progress
in
that
congress
similar
bills
were
subsequently
introduced
and
diligently
supported
in
each
succeeding
congress
but
it
was
not
until
the
very
closing
hour
of
the
expiring
session
of
that
the
necessary
enactment
was
effected
and
the
appropriation
secured
the
plan
of
construction
devised
by
professor
morse
for
the
experimental
line
of
telegraph
to
be
erected
between
washington
and
baltimore
under
the
congressional
appropriation
provided
for
placing
insulated
wires
in
a
lead
pipe
underground
this
was
to
be
accomplished
by
the
use
of
a
specially
devised
plough
of
peculiar
construction
to
be
drawn
by
a
powerful
team
by
which
means
the
pipe
containing
the
electric
conductors
was
to
be
automatically
deposited
in
the
earth
this
apparatus
was
entirely
successful
in
operation
and
the
pipe
was
thus
buried
to
the
complete
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
at
a
cost
very
much
lower
than
the
work
could
have
been
accomplished
in
any
other
manner
two
wires
were
to
be
used
to
form
a
complete
metallic
circuit
for
at
that
time
it
was
not
known
as
was
shortly
afterward
discovered
that
the
earth
could
be
used
to
form
of
the
circuit
for
purposes
of
insulation
the
wires
were
neatly
covered
with
and
then
saturated
in
a
bath
of
hot
but
this
treatment
proved
defective
in
insulating
properties
for
when
ten
miles
of
line
had
been
completed
the
wires
were
found
to
be
wholly
useless
for
electric
conduction
no
mode
had
been
devised
for
the
treatment
of
to
make
it
available
for
purposes
of
insulation
and
was
wholly
unknown
as
an
article
of
use
or
commerce
in
this
country
thousand
dollars
of
the
government
appropriation
had
been
expended
and
the
work
thus
far
accomplished
was
an
acknowledged
failure
only
seven
thousand
dollars
of
the
available
fund
remained
unexpended
and
this
was
regarded
as
inadequate
to
complete
the
undertaking
under
any
other
plan
the
friends
of
the
enterprise
were
in
despair
and
for
some
time
saw
no
other
alternative
than
to
apply
to
congress
for
an
additional
appropriation
this
however
was
regarded
as
almost
hopeless
and
the
difficulty
of
the
situation
was
extremely
embarrassing
an
amusing
incident
was
related
of
the
means
used
to
keep
from
public
knowledge
the
desperate
situation
professor
morse
finally
visited
the
scene
of
activity
where
the
was
proceeding
and
calling
the
superintendent
aside
confided
to
him
the
fact
that
the
work
must
be
stopped
without
the
newspapers
finding
out
the
true
reason
of
its
suspension
the
superintendent
was
equal
to
the
occasion
and
starting
the
ponderous
machine
soon
managed
to
run
foul
of
a
protruding
rock
and
break
the
plough
the
newspapers
published
sensational
accounts
of
the
accident
and
announced
that
it
would
require
several
weeks
to
repair
damages
thus
the
real
trouble
was
kept
from
the
public
until
new
plans
could
be
determined
upon
after
long
and
careful
consideration
professor
morse
very
reluctantly
decided
to
erect
the
wires
on
poles
this
plan
was
at
first
considered
wholly
objectionable
under
the
apprehension
that
the
structure
would
be
disturbed
by
persons
it
had
however
become
manifest
that
this
was
the
only
mode
of
construction
that
could
be
accomplished
within
the
remainder
of
the
appropriation
and
finally
upon
ascertaining
that
pole
lines
had
already
been
adopted
in
england
it
was
determined
to
proceed
in
this
manner
the
line
was
thus
completed
between
washington
and
baltimore
about
may
and
proved
to
be
successful
and
in
every
way
satisfactory
in
its
operation
shortly
after
the
completion
of
the
line
the
national
democratic
convention
which
nominated
polk
and
dallas
for
president
and
assembled
in
baltimore
may
reports
of
the
convention
proceedings
were
promptly
telegraphed
to
the
capital
city
where
the
telegraph
office
was
thronged
with
members
of
congress
interested
in
the
news
these
reports
created
an
immense
sensation
in
washington
and
speedily
removed
all
doubts
as
to
the
practical
success
of
the
new
system
of
communication
a
despatch
from
the
honorable
silas
wright
then
united
states
senator
from
new
york
refusing
to
accept
the
nomination
for
was
read
in
the
national
convention
and
produced
an
extraordinary
interest
from
the
fact
that
very
few
of
the
delegates
had
ever
heard
of
the
telegraph
and
it
required
much
explanation
to
satisfy
them
of
the
genuineness
of
the
alleged
communication
having
thus
established
beyond
all
reasonable
question
the
practical
utility
of
the
telegraph
as
a
superior
means
of
public
and
private
communication
professor
morse
and
his
associates
offered
their
patents
to
the
united
states
government
for
the
very
moderate
price
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
with
a
view
of
having
the
system
adopted
for
general
use
in
connection
with
the
postal
establishment
this
proposition
was
referred
to
the
for
consideration
and
report
after
due
deliberation
that
officer
reported
that
although
the
invention
is
an
agent
vastly
superior
to
any
other
ever
devised
by
the
genius
of
man
yet
the
operation
between
washington
and
baltimore
has
not
satisfied
me
that
under
any
rate
of
postage
that
can
be
adopted
its
revenues
can
be
made
to
cover
its
expenditures
under
the
influence
of
this
report
congress
very
naturally
declined
the
offer
of
the
patentees
and
the
telegraph
was
thereupon
relegated
to
the
domain
of
private
enterprise
the
result
was
that
the
patentees
finally
realized
for
their
interests
many
times
the
amount
of
their
offer
to
the
government
during
the
autumn
of
short
exhibition
lines
were
erected
in
boston
and
new
york
for
the
purpose
of
familiarizing
business
men
of
those
cities
with
the
characteristics
of
the
new
invention
but
they
attracted
little
attention
and
the
promoters
had
much
cause
of
discouragement
on
account
of
public
indifference
for
the
purpose
of
arousing
more
attention
to
the
system
appeals
were
made
to
the
public
press
for
favorable
notice
which
were
also
generally
declined
the
proprietor
of
one
of
the
most
prominent
and
enterprising
of
the
new
york
daily
papers
distinctly
refused
to
encourage
the
establishment
of
telegraph
lines
for
the
reason
as
he
freely
acknowledged
that
if
the
new
method
of
transmitting
intelligence
were
to
come
into
general
use
his
competitors
could
use
it
as
well
as
himself
and
he
would
therefore
be
deprived
of
his
present
advantage
over
them
for
procuring
early
news
by
the
use
of
an
expensive
system
of
special
despatch
then
maintained
by
his
paper
two
years
later
he
refused
to
join
other
papers
in
receiving
the
governor
message
by
telegraph
from
albany
and
was
so
badly
beaten
by
his
rivals
in
this
instance
that
his
paper
was
thenceforward
one
of
the
most
generous
patrons
of
the
telegraph
early
in
the
year
a
corporate
organization
was
effected
for
the
extension
of
the
telegraph
from
baltimore
to
philadelphia
and
new
york
under
the
name
of
the
magnetic
telegraph
company
for
which
a
special
act
of
incorporation
was
obtained
from
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
maryland
nearly
all
of
the
capital
of
this
company
was
subscribed
by
washington
people
baltimore
and
philadelphia
furnished
only
a
few
hundred
dollars
while
new
york
contributed
nothing
slow
progress
was
made
toward
the
construction
of
the
line
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
the
right
of
way
either
upon
railways
or
highways
and
it
was
not
until
january
that
the
line
was
completed
to
the
west
side
of
the
hudson
river
which
formed
an
impassable
barrier
to
further
progress
for
a
considerable
period
no
method
of
insulation
had
yet
been
devised
that
would
permit
the
operation
of
an
electric
conductor
under
water
and
it
was
doubted
whether
a
wire
could
be
maintained
for
a
span
sufficient
to
cross
the
river
overhead
finally
however
high
masts
were
erected
on
the
palisades
near
fort
lee
and
on
the
heights
at
fort
washington
on
the
new
york
side
and
a
steel
wire
was
suspended
upon
them
this
plan
was
successful
except
that
occasionally
the
wire
was
broken
by
an
extraordinary
burden
of
sleet
in
the
winter
season
this
method
of
crossing
the
lower
hudson
was
continued
for
more
than
ten
years
when
it
was
superseded
by
submarine
cables
during
the
year
incorporated
companies
were
formed
under
which
telegraph
lines
were
extended
from
new
york
to
boston
buffalo
and
pittsburg
and
within
the
next
three
years
nearly
every
important
town
in
the
united
states
and
canada
from
louis
and
new
orleans
to
montreal
and
halifax
was
brought
into
telegraphic
communication
thus
after
fifteen
years
of
struggle
with
all
the
pains
of
poverty
often
lacking
even
the
common
necessaries
of
life
professor
morse
and
his
faithful
colaborers
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
in
of
knowing
and
realizing
that
the
telegraph
system
had
finally
achieved
not
only
scientific
success
for
this
had
been
proven
years
before
but
that
financial
success
ample
and
complete
had
come
to
pay
them
richly
for
all
the
dark
days
and
wearisome
years
through
which
they
had
passed
once
generally
established
the
telegraph
won
its
way
to
popular
appreciation
very
rapidly
it
was
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
it
was
not
long
before
every
town
of
any
considerable
importance
regarded
telegraphic
facilities
as
an
indispensable
necessity
the
small
cost
soon
induced
the
construction
of
rival
lines
regardless
of
the
rights
of
the
patentees
and
within
a
very
few
years
unwise
competition
began
to
bring
many
lines
to
a
condition
of
bankruptcy
the
weaker
concerns
soon
passed
through
the
sheriff
hands
and
found
purchasers
only
at
an
extreme
sacrifice
at
the
bidding
of
the
more
provident
and
conservative
proprietors
of
competing
lines
instead
of
inducing
a
more
prudent
course
these
disastrous
results
only
served
to
feed
the
spirit
of
rivalry
and
general
insolvency
seemed
to
threaten
the
permanent
prosperity
of
the
telegraph
business
in
consequence
of
the
wild
and
reckless
competition
which
appeared
to
be
inherent
in
its
nature
this
extremely
unsatisfactory
condition
of
telegraph
rivalry
drifted
on
from
bad
to
worse
until
when
from
dire
necessity
of
a
few
of
the
more
prudent
and
proprietors
of
telegraph
property
were
induced
to
combine
their
interests
with
some
of
their
competitors
and
thus
avoid
the
ruinous
policy
which
had
been
so
rapidly
exhausting
their
vitality
accordingly
the
principal
telegraph
lines
in
ohio
indiana
michigan
and
some
of
the
neighboring
states
were
brought
into
fraternal
relations
and
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
the
new
policy
soon
brought
prosperity
in
place
of
waste
and
improvidence
profits
were
devoted
to
the
purchase
of
additional
lines
thus
enlarging
their
domain
and
strengthening
their
position
prosperity
increased
with
rapid
strides
and
the
beneficial
effects
of
extirpating
wasteful
rivalry
and
building
up
a
substantial
system
with
superior
facilities
and
provident
management
gave
the
new
organization
a
dominating
influence
among
the
telegraph
companies
of
america
the
same
general
policy
has
been
pursued
to
the
present
time
and
has
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
a
prosperous
corporation
of
magnificent
proportions
carrying
on
a
useful
and
beneficent
business
under
a
greater
number
of
governmental
jurisdictions
great
and
small
than
any
other
corporate
organization
in
existence
for
the
development
of
the
telegraph
enterprise
in
america
no
thanks
are
due
to
the
wealthy
capitalists
as
a
rule
they
would
not
listen
to
suggestions
of
investing
their
money
in
what
was
contemptuously
termed
rotten
poles
and
rusty
wires
they
wanted
something
more
substantial
and
conservative
as
the
basis
of
their
investments
an
early
pioneer
and
builder
of
telegraph
lines
whose
name
is
now
held
in
grateful
memory
for
deeds
of
philanthropic
beneficence
visited
the
city
of
chicago
in
to
solicit
subscriptions
to
the
capital
stock
of
a
company
then
engaged
in
construction
of
the
first
line
of
telegraph
between
that
place
and
the
city
of
buffalo
he
presented
a
carefully
prepared
prospectus
showing
an
estimated
earning
capacity
of
the
projected
line
of
one
hundred
dollars
per
day
the
merits
of
the
contemplated
enterprise
were
freely
canvassed
at
a
meeting
of
bankers
at
which
one
of
the
most
prominent
declared
that
any
man
who
ever
expected
to
see
one
hundred
dollars
per
day
paid
for
telegraphing
west
of
buffalo
must
be
crazy
and
unworthy
of
belief
this
oracular
declaration
prevailed
and
the
project
was
ignominiously
rejected
by
the
wise
men
of
chicago
fortunately
citizens
of
smaller
towns
like
ypsilanti
kalamazoo
south
bend
kenosha
and
racine
took
a
more
sensible
view
of
the
proposed
enterprise
and
the
line
was
built
despite
the
contempt
of
chicago
capitalists
now
however
the
men
of
chicago
pay
more
than
five
thousand
dollars
a
day
for
telegraphing
at
rates
far
lower
than
would
have
been
thought
possible
in
that
early
day
the
true
spirit
of
enterprise
which
has
so
grandly
developed
the
resources
of
our
imperial
domain
has
generally
been
found
to
prevail
among
people
of
modest
means
thus
nearly
every
dollar
of
capital
contributed
toward
the
establishment
of
telegraph
lines
in
this
country
came
from
the
offerings
of
people
in
very
moderate
circumstances
in
this
connection
therefore
it
is
extremely
gratifying
to
state
that
very
few
enterprises
of
any
kind
have
returned
such
generous
recompense
for
the
amount
of
capital
invested
as
the
telegraph
and
telephone
lines
in
america
considering
the
apparently
temporary
and
character
of
the
structures
erected
for
these
purposes
it
seems
difficult
to
comprehend
the
truth
of
this
statement
the
method
of
telegraphic
communication
devised
by
professor
morse
has
been
continued
in
general
use
in
this
country
but
instead
of
requiring
separate
wire
for
each
circuit
as
formerly
six
independent
circuits
are
now
operated
simultaneously
over
a
single
wire
by
the
use
of
the
sextuplex
apparatus
repeal
of
the
english
corn
laws
justin
mccarthy
after
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
the
tariff
legislation
of
great
britain
was
guided
by
a
new
policy
that
of
free
trade
and
it
has
been
followed
ever
since
the
reactionary
tendencies
of
continental
europe
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
reached
also
to
england
where
they
controlled
the
conduct
of
political
affairs
until
canning
in
became
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
his
policy
was
liberal
and
did
much
in
forming
the
public
opinion
that
at
length
found
voice
in
catholic
emancipation
in
the
reform
bill
and
in
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
english
colonies
then
followed
important
amendments
of
the
extension
of
local
governmental
powers
in
the
towns
improvement
of
popular
education
and
other
reforms
through
all
this
gradual
progress
in
liberal
government
and
public
amelioration
the
need
of
another
reform
had
been
pointed
out
by
some
thinkers
and
statesmen
and
at
last
the
condition
of
the
country
favored
the
views
of
its
advocates
the
corn
laws
protected
the
english
producers
by
imposing
heavy
duties
on
imported
grain
at
one
time
these
duties
practically
prohibited
such
importation
mccarthy
shows
how
the
laws
operated
upon
the
people
and
his
story
of
the
memorable
agitation
for
their
repeal
and
of
the
accomplishment
of
that
object
could
not
have
been
better
told
in
the
celebrated
corn
law
was
passed
which
was
itself
moulded
on
the
corn
law
of
by
the
act
of
wheat
might
be
exported
upon
a
payment
of
one
shilling
per
quarter
customs
duty
but
the
importation
of
foreign
grain
was
practically
prohibited
until
the
price
of
wheat
in
england
had
reached
eighty
shillings
a
quarter
that
is
to
say
until
a
certain
price
had
been
secured
for
the
grower
of
grain
at
the
expense
of
all
the
consumers
in
this
country
it
was
not
permitted
to
englishmen
to
obtain
their
supplies
from
any
foreign
land
unless
on
conditions
that
suited
the
english
pocket
we
may
perhaps
make
this
principle
a
little
more
clear
if
it
be
necessary
by
illustrating
its
working
on
a
small
scale
and
within
narrow
limits
in
a
particular
street
in
london
let
us
say
a
law
is
passed
declaring
that
no
one
must
buy
a
loaf
of
bread
out
of
that
street
or
even
round
the
corner
until
the
price
of
bread
has
risen
so
high
in
the
street
itself
as
to
secure
to
its
two
or
three
bakers
a
certain
enormous
scale
of
profit
on
their
loaves
when
the
price
of
bread
has
been
forced
up
so
high
as
to
pass
this
scale
of
profit
then
it
would
be
permissible
for
those
who
stood
in
need
of
bread
to
go
round
the
corner
and
buy
their
loaves
of
the
baker
in
the
next
street
but
the
moment
that
their
continuing
to
do
this
caused
the
price
of
the
bread
in
their
own
street
to
fall
below
the
prescribed
limit
they
must
instantly
take
to
buying
bread
within
their
own
bounds
and
of
their
own
bakers
again
this
is
a
fair
illustration
of
the
principle
on
which
the
corn
laws
were
moulded
the
corn
law
of
was
passed
in
order
to
enable
the
landowners
and
farmers
to
recover
from
the
depression
caused
by
the
long
era
of
foreign
war
it
was
rushed
through
parliament
if
we
may
use
an
american
expression
petitions
of
the
most
urgent
nature
poured
in
against
it
from
all
the
commercial
and
manufacturing
classes
and
in
vain
popular
disturbances
broke
out
in
many
places
the
poor
everywhere
saw
the
bread
of
their
family
threatened
saw
the
food
of
their
children
almost
taken
out
of
their
mouths
and
they
naturally
broke
into
wild
extremes
of
anger
in
london
there
were
serious
riots
and
the
houses
of
some
of
the
most
prominent
supporters
of
the
bill
were
attacked
the
incendiary
went
to
work
in
many
parts
of
the
country
at
that
time
it
was
still
the
way
in
england
as
it
is
now
in
russia
and
other
countries
for
popular
indignation
to
express
itself
in
the
frequent
incendiary
fire
at
one
place
near
london
a
riot
lasted
for
two
days
and
nights
the
soldiers
had
to
be
called
out
to
put
it
down
and
five
men
were
hanged
for
taking
part
in
it
after
the
passing
of
the
corn
law
of
and
when
it
had
worked
for
some
time
there
were
acts
introduced
which
established
a
varying
system
of
duty
so
that
when
the
price
of
grain
rose
above
a
certain
figure
the
duty
on
imported
wheat
was
to
sink
in
proportion
the
principle
of
all
these
measures
was
the
same
how
it
may
be
asked
could
any
sane
legislator
adopt
such
measures
as
well
might
it
be
asked
how
can
any
civilized
nation
still
as
some
still
do
believe
in
such
a
principle
the
truth
is
that
the
principle
is
one
which
has
a
strong
fascination
for
most
persons
the
charm
of
which
it
is
difficult
for
any
class
in
its
turn
wholly
to
shake
off
the
idea
is
that
if
our
typical
baker
be
paid
more
than
the
market
price
for
a
loaf
he
will
be
able
in
turn
to
pay
more
to
the
butcher
than
the
fair
price
for
his
beef
the
butcher
thus
benefited
will
be
enabled
to
deal
on
more
liberal
terms
with
the
tailor
the
tailor
so
favored
by
legislation
will
be
able
in
his
turn
to
order
a
better
kind
of
beer
from
the
publican
and
pay
a
higher
price
for
it
thus
by
some
extraordinary
process
everybody
pays
too
much
for
everything
and
nevertheless
all
are
enriched
in
turn
the
absurdity
of
this
is
easily
kept
out
of
sight
where
the
protective
duties
affect
a
number
of
varying
and
complicated
interests
manufacturing
commercial
and
productive
in
the
united
states
for
example
where
the
manufacturers
are
benefited
in
one
place
and
the
producers
are
benefited
in
another
and
where
the
country
always
produces
food
abundant
to
supply
its
own
wants
men
are
not
brought
so
directly
face
to
face
with
the
fallacy
of
the
principle
as
they
were
in
england
at
the
time
of
the
law
league
in
america
protection
affects
manufacturers
for
the
most
part
and
there
is
no
such
popular
craving
for
cheap
manufactures
as
to
bring
the
protective
principle
into
collision
with
the
daily
wants
of
the
people
but
in
england
during
the
reign
of
the
corn
law
the
food
which
the
people
put
into
their
mouths
was
the
article
mainly
taxed
and
made
cruelly
costly
by
the
working
of
protection
nevertheless
the
country
put
up
with
this
system
down
to
the
close
of
the
year
at
that
time
there
was
a
stagnation
of
trade
and
a
general
depression
of
business
severe
poverty
prevailed
in
many
districts
inevitably
therefore
the
question
arose
in
the
minds
of
most
men
in
distressed
or
depressed
places
whether
it
could
be
a
good
thing
for
the
country
in
general
to
have
the
price
of
bread
kept
high
by
factitious
means
when
wages
had
sunk
and
work
become
scarce
an
association
was
formed
in
london
it
began
pretentiously
enough
but
it
brought
about
no
result
london
is
not
a
place
where
popular
agitation
finds
a
fitting
centre
in
however
bolton
in
lancashire
suffered
from
a
serious
commercial
crisis
of
its
manufacturing
activity
became
paralyzed
at
once
many
houses
of
business
were
actually
closed
and
abandoned
and
thousands
of
workmen
were
left
without
the
means
of
life
lancashire
suddenly
roused
itself
into
the
resolve
to
agitate
against
the
corn
laws
and
manchester
became
the
headquarters
of
the
movement
which
afterward
accomplished
so
much
the
league
was
formed
and
a
hall
was
built
in
manchester
on
the
scene
of
that
disturbance
which
was
called
the
massacre
of
peterloo
the
leaders
of
the
movement
were
richard
cobden
john
bright
and
charles
villiers
cobden
was
not
a
manchester
man
he
was
the
son
of
a
sussex
farmer
after
the
death
of
his
father
he
was
taken
by
his
uncle
and
employed
in
his
wholesale
warehouse
in
the
city
of
london
he
afterward
became
a
partner
in
a
manchester
and
sometimes
travelled
on
the
commercial
business
of
the
establishment
he
became
what
would
then
have
been
considered
a
great
traveller
distinct
of
course
from
the
class
of
explorers
that
is
he
made
himself
thoroughly
familiar
with
most
or
all
of
the
countries
of
europe
with
various
parts
of
the
east
and
with
the
united
states
and
canada
he
had
had
a
fair
homely
education
and
he
improved
it
wherever
he
went
by
experience
by
observation
and
by
conversation
with
all
manner
of
men
he
became
one
of
the
most
effective
and
persuasive
popular
speakers
ever
known
in
english
agitation
he
was
not
an
orator
in
the
highest
sense
he
had
no
imagination
and
little
poetic
feeling
nor
did
genuine
passion
ever
inflame
into
fervor
of
declamation
his
quiet
argumentative
style
but
he
had
humor
he
spoke
simple
clear
strong
english
he
used
no
unnecessary
words
he
always
made
his
meaning
plain
and
intelligible
and
he
had
an
admirable
faculty
for
illustrating
every
argument
by
something
drawn
from
reading
or
from
observation
or
from
experience
he
was
in
fact
the
very
perfection
of
a
talker
a
man
fit
to
deal
with
men
by
fair
straightforward
argument
to
expose
complicated
sophistries
and
to
make
clear
the
most
perplexed
parts
of
an
intricate
question
he
was
exactly
the
man
for
that
time
for
that
question
and
for
the
persuasive
and
argumentative
part
of
the
great
controversy
which
he
had
undertaken
cobden
chief
companion
in
the
struggle
was
john
bright
whose
name
has
been
completely
identified
with
that
of
cobden
in
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
bright
was
an
orator
of
the
highest
order
he
had
all
the
qualifications
that
make
a
master
of
eloquence
his
presence
was
commanding
his
voice
was
singularly
strong
and
clear
and
had
peculiar
tones
and
shades
in
it
which
gave
indescribable
meaning
to
passages
of
anger
of
pity
or
of
contempt
his
manner
was
quiet
composed
serene
he
indulged
in
little
or
no
gesticulation
he
had
a
rich
gift
of
genuine
saxon
humor
these
two
men
one
belonging
to
the
middle
class
of
the
north
one
sprung
from
the
yeomanry
of
southern
england
had
as
a
colleague
charles
villiers
a
man
of
high
aristocratic
family
of
marked
ability
and
of
indomitable
loyalty
to
any
cause
he
undertook
villiers
for
some
years
represented
the
cause
in
parliament
and
bright
and
cobden
did
its
work
on
the
platform
cobden
first
and
bright
after
him
became
members
of
the
house
of
commons
and
they
were
further
assisted
there
by
milner
gibson
a
man
of
position
and
family
an
effective
debater
who
had
been
at
first
a
conservative
but
who
passed
over
to
the
ranks
of
the
free
traders
and
through
them
to
the
ranks
of
the
liberals
or
radicals
every
year
villiers
brought
on
a
motion
in
the
house
in
favor
of
free
trade
for
a
long
time
this
motion
was
only
one
of
the
annual
performances
which
by
an
apparently
inevitable
necessity
have
to
prelude
for
many
years
the
practical
movement
of
any
great
parliamentary
question
villiers
might
have
brought
on
his
annual
motion
all
his
life
without
getting
much
nearer
to
his
object
if
manchester
birmingham
sheffield
leeds
and
other
great
northern
towns
had
not
taken
the
matter
vigorously
in
hand
if
cobden
and
bright
had
not
stirred
up
the
energies
of
the
whole
country
and
brought
clearly
home
to
the
mind
of
every
man
the
plain
fact
that
reason
argument
and
arithmetic
as
well
as
freedom
and
justice
were
distinctly
on
their
side
the
league
showered
pamphlets
tracts
letters
newspapers
all
over
the
country
they
sent
lecturers
into
every
town
preaching
the
same
doctrine
and
proving
by
scientific
facts
the
justice
of
the
cause
they
advocated
these
lecturers
were
enjoined
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
any
appeals
to
sentiment
or
to
passion
the
cause
they
had
in
hand
was
one
which
could
best
be
served
by
the
clear
statement
of
rigorous
facts
by
the
simple
explanation
of
economical
truths
which
no
sophism
could
darken
and
which
no
opposing
eloquence
could
charm
away
the
melbourne
ministry
fell
in
it
died
of
inanition
its
force
was
spent
sir
robert
peel
came
into
office
cobden
who
then
entered
the
house
of
commons
for
the
first
time
seemed
to
have
good
hope
that
even
peel
strong
conservative
though
he
was
might
prove
to
be
a
man
from
whom
the
free
traders
could
expect
substantial
assistance
sir
robert
peel
had
in
fact
in
those
later
years
expressed
again
and
again
his
conviction
as
to
the
general
truth
of
the
principles
of
free
trade
all
agree
he
said
in
in
the
general
rule
that
we
should
buy
in
the
cheapest
and
sell
in
the
dearest
market
but
he
contended
that
while
such
was
the
general
rule
yet
various
economical
and
social
conditions
made
it
necessary
that
there
should
be
some
distinct
exceptions
and
he
regarded
the
corn
laws
and
sugar
duties
as
such
exceptions
it
may
be
mentioned
perhaps
that
the
corn
laws
had
in
fact
been
treated
as
a
necessary
exception
by
many
of
the
leading
exponents
of
the
principles
of
free
trade
thus
we
have
to
notice
the
curious
fact
that
while
sir
robert
peel
own
party
looked
upon
his
accession
to
power
as
a
certain
guarantee
against
any
concession
to
the
free
traders
the
free
traders
themselves
were
for
the
most
part
convinced
that
their
cause
had
better
hope
from
him
than
from
a
whig
ministry
the
free
traders
went
on
debating
and
dividing
in
the
house
agitating
and
lecturing
all
over
the
country
for
some
years
without
any
marked
parliamentary
success
following
their
endeavors
an
immense
and
overwhelming
majority
always
voted
against
them
in
the
house
of
commons
they
were
making
progress
and
very
great
progress
but
it
was
not
that
kind
of
advance
which
had
yet
come
to
be
decided
by
a
parliamentary
vote
probably
a
keen
and
experienced
eye
might
have
noted
clearly
enough
the
progress
they
were
making
the
whig
party
were
coming
more
and
more
round
to
the
principles
of
free
trade
day
after
day
some
whig
leader
was
admitting
that
the
theories
of
the
past
would
not
do
for
the
present
and
as
we
have
said
the
tory
leader
had
himself
gone
so
far
as
to
admit
the
justice
of
the
general
principles
of
free
trade
at
one
point
the
main
difference
between
sir
robert
peel
the
leader
of
the
house
of
commons
and
lord
john
russell
the
leader
of
the
opposition
seems
to
have
been
nothing
more
than
this
that
peel
still
regarded
grain
as
a
necessary
exception
to
the
principle
of
free
trade
and
lord
john
russell
was
not
clear
that
the
time
had
come
when
it
could
be
treated
otherwise
than
as
an
exception
an
event
however
over
which
no
parties
and
no
leaders
had
any
control
suddenly
intervened
to
hasten
the
action
and
spur
the
convictions
of
the
leaders
on
both
sides
and
especially
of
the
prime
minister
this
was
the
great
famine
which
broke
out
in
ireland
in
the
autumn
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
irish
people
had
long
depended
for
their
food
on
the
potato
alone
the
summer
of
had
been
a
long
season
of
wet
and
cold
and
sunlessness
in
the
autumn
the
news
went
abroad
that
the
whole
potato
crop
of
ireland
was
in
danger
of
destruction
if
not
already
actually
destroyed
before
attention
had
well
been
awakened
to
the
crisis
it
was
officially
announced
that
more
than
of
the
entire
potato
crop
had
been
swept
away
by
the
disease
and
that
it
had
not
ceased
its
ravages
but
on
the
contrary
was
spreading
more
and
more
every
day
the
general
impression
of
those
who
could
form
an
opinion
was
that
the
whole
of
the
crop
must
perish
the
league
cried
out
for
the
opening
of
the
ports
and
the
admission
of
grain
and
food
from
all
places
sir
robert
peel
was
decidedly
in
favor
of
such
a
course
the
duke
of
wellington
and
lord
stanley
opposed
the
idea
and
the
proposition
was
given
up
only
three
members
of
the
cabinet
supported
sir
robert
peel
proposals
lord
aberdeen
sir
james
graham
sidney
herbert
all
the
others
objected
some
because
they
opposed
the
principle
of
the
measure
and
were
convinced
that
if
the
ports
were
once
opened
they
would
never
be
closed
again
which
indeed
was
probably
peel
own
conviction
and
others
on
the
ground
that
no
sufficient
proof
had
yet
been
given
that
such
a
measure
was
necessary
lord
john
russell
almost
immediately
after
wrote
a
letter
from
edinburgh
to
his
constituents
the
electors
of
the
city
of
london
in
which
he
declared
that
something
must
immediately
be
done
that
it
was
no
longer
worth
while
to
contend
for
a
fixed
duty
and
that
an
end
must
be
put
to
the
whole
system
of
protection
as
the
blight
of
commerce
the
bane
of
agriculture
the
source
of
bitter
division
among
classes
the
cause
of
penury
fever
and
crime
among
the
people
this
letter
produced
a
decisive
effect
on
peel
he
saw
that
the
whigs
were
prepared
to
unite
with
the
league
in
agitating
for
the
total
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
and
he
therefore
made
up
his
mind
to
recommend
to
the
cabinet
an
early
meeting
of
parliament
with
the
view
to
anticipate
the
agitation
which
he
saw
must
succeed
in
the
end
and
to
bring
forward
as
a
government
measure
some
scheme
which
should
at
least
prepare
the
way
for
the
speedy
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
a
cabinet
council
was
held
almost
immediately
after
the
publication
of
lord
john
russell
letter
and
peel
recommended
the
summoning
of
parliament
in
order
to
take
instant
measures
to
cope
with
the
distress
in
ireland
and
also
to
introduce
legislation
distinctly
intended
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
lord
stanley
could
not
accept
the
proposition
the
duke
of
wellington
was
himself
of
opinion
that
the
corn
laws
ought
to
be
maintained
but
at
the
same
time
he
declared
that
he
considered
good
government
for
the
country
more
important
than
corn
laws
or
any
other
considerations
and
that
he
was
therefore
ready
to
support
sir
robert
peel
administration
through
thick
and
thin
lord
stanley
and
the
duke
of
buccleuch
however
declared
that
they
could
not
be
parties
to
any
legislation
which
tended
toward
the
repeal
of
the
sir
robert
peel
did
not
feel
himself
strong
enough
to
carry
out
his
project
in
the
face
of
such
opposition
in
the
cabinet
itself
and
he
tendered
his
resignation
to
the
queen
the
queen
sent
for
lord
john
russell
but
russell
party
were
not
very
strong
in
the
country
and
they
had
not
a
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
lord
john
tried
however
to
form
a
ministry
without
a
parliamentary
majority
and
even
although
sir
robert
peel
would
not
give
any
pledge
to
support
a
measure
for
the
immediate
and
complete
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
lord
john
russell
was
not
successful
lord
grey
son
of
the
lord
grey
of
the
reform
bill
objected
to
the
foreign
policy
of
lord
palmerston
and
thought
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
ought
to
be
offered
to
cobden
lord
john
russell
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
announce
to
the
queen
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
form
a
ministry
the
queen
sent
for
sir
robert
peel
again
and
asked
him
to
withdraw
his
resignation
peel
complied
and
almost
immediately
resumed
the
functions
of
first
minister
of
the
crown
the
duke
of
buccleuch
consented
to
go
on
with
him
but
lord
stanley
held
to
his
resolution
and
had
no
place
in
the
ministry
his
position
as
secretary
of
state
for
the
colonies
was
taken
by
william
gladstone
gladstone
however
did
not
sit
in
parliament
during
the
eventful
session
when
the
corn
laws
were
repealed
he
had
sat
for
the
borough
of
newark
which
was
under
the
influence
of
the
duke
of
newcastle
and
as
the
duke
of
newcastle
had
withdrawn
his
support
from
the
ministry
gladstone
did
not
seek
for
newark
and
remained
without
a
seat
in
the
house
of
commons
for
some
months
parliament
met
on
january
the
speech
from
the
throne
delivered
by
the
queen
in
person
recommended
the
legislature
to
take
into
consideration
the
necessity
of
still
further
applying
the
principle
on
which
it
had
formerly
acted
when
measures
were
presented
to
extend
commerce
and
to
stimulate
domestic
skill
and
industry
by
the
repeal
of
prohibitive
and
the
relaxation
of
protective
duties
in
the
debate
on
the
address
sir
robert
peel
rose
after
the
mover
and
seconder
had
spoken
and
the
question
had
been
put
from
the
chair
and
at
once
proceeded
to
explain
the
policy
which
he
intended
to
adopt
his
speech
was
long
and
labored
and
somewhat
wearied
the
audience
by
the
elaborate
manner
in
which
he
explained
how
his
opinions
had
been
brought
into
gradual
change
with
regard
to
free
trade
and
protection
he
made
it
however
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
now
a
convert
to
cobden
opinions
and
that
he
intended
to
introduce
some
measure
which
should
practically
amount
to
the
abolition
of
protection
it
was
in
this
debate
and
immediately
after
peel
had
spoken
that
benjamin
disraeli
made
his
first
great
impression
on
parliament
he
had
been
in
the
house
for
many
years
and
had
made
many
attempts
had
sometimes
been
laughed
at
had
sometimes
been
disliked
and
occasionally
for
a
moment
admired
but
it
was
when
he
rose
immediately
after
sir
robert
peel
and
denounced
peel
as
one
who
had
betrayed
his
party
and
his
principles
that
he
made
the
first
deep
impression
on
the
house
of
commons
and
came
to
be
considered
as
a
serious
and
influential
parliamentary
personage
i
am
not
one
of
the
converts
disraeli
said
i
am
perhaps
a
member
of
a
fallen
party
a
new
protection
party
was
formed
almost
immediately
under
the
leadership
of
george
lord
bentinck
a
man
of
great
energy
and
tenacity
of
purpose
who
had
hitherto
spent
his
life
almost
altogether
on
the
turf
who
had
had
almost
no
previous
preparation
for
leadership
or
even
for
debate
but
who
certainly
when
he
did
accept
the
responsible
position
offered
to
him
showed
a
considerable
capacity
for
leadership
and
an
unwearying
attention
to
his
duties
on
january
sir
robert
peel
explained
his
financial
policy
his
intention
was
to
abandon
the
sliding
scale
altogether
to
impose
for
the
present
a
duty
of
ten
shillings
a
quarter
on
corn
when
the
price
of
it
was
under
shillings
a
quarter
to
reduce
that
duty
by
one
shilling
for
every
shilling
of
rise
in
price
until
it
reached
shillings
a
quarter
when
the
duty
should
fall
to
four
shillings
this
however
was
to
be
only
a
temporary
arrangement
it
was
to
last
but
three
years
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
protective
duties
on
grain
were
to
be
wholly
abandoned
we
need
not
go
at
any
length
into
the
history
of
the
long
debates
on
peel
propositions
the
discussion
of
one
amendment
which
was
in
substance
a
motion
to
reject
the
scheme
altogether
lasted
for
twelve
nights
the
third
reading
of
the
bill
passed
the
house
of
commons
on
may
by
a
majority
of
the
bill
went
up
at
once
to
the
house
of
lords
and
at
the
urgent
pressure
of
the
duke
of
wellington
was
carried
through
that
house
without
any
serious
opposition
the
duke
made
no
secret
of
his
own
opinions
he
assured
many
of
his
brother
peers
that
he
disliked
the
measure
just
as
much
as
anyone
could
do
but
he
insisted
that
they
had
all
better
vote
for
it
nevertheless
sir
robert
peel
had
triumphed
but
he
found
himself
deserted
by
a
large
and
influential
section
of
the
party
he
once
had
led
most
of
the
great
landowners
and
country
gentlemen
of
the
conservative
party
abandoned
him
some
of
them
felt
the
bitterest
resentment
toward
him
they
believed
he
had
betrayed
them
although
nothing
could
be
more
clear
than
that
for
years
he
had
distinctly
been
making
it
known
to
the
house
that
his
principles
inclined
him
toward
free
trade
and
thereby
leaving
it
to
be
understood
that
if
opportunity
or
emergency
should
compel
him
he
would
be
glad
to
declare
himself
a
free
trader
even
in
the
matter
of
grain
strange
to
say
the
day
when
the
bill
was
read
in
the
house
of
lords
for
the
third
time
saw
the
fall
of
peel
ministry
the
fall
was
due
to
the
state
of
ireland
the
government
had
been
bringing
in
a
coercion
bill
for
ireland
it
was
introduced
while
the
corn
bill
was
yet
passing
through
the
house
of
commons
the
situation
was
critical
all
the
irish
followers
of
daniel
would
be
sure
to
oppose
the
coercion
bill
the
liberal
party
at
least
when
out
of
office
had
usually
made
it
their
principle
to
oppose
coercion
bills
if
they
were
not
attended
with
some
promises
of
legislative
reform
the
english
radical
members
led
by
cobden
and
bright
were
certain
to
oppose
coercion
if
the
protectionists
should
join
with
these
other
opponents
of
the
coercion
bill
the
fate
of
the
measure
was
assured
and
with
it
the
fate
of
the
government
this
was
exactly
what
happened
eighty
protectionists
followed
lord
george
bentinck
into
the
lobby
against
the
bill
in
combination
with
the
free
traders
the
whigs
and
the
irish
catholic
and
national
members
the
division
took
place
on
the
second
reading
of
the
bill
on
thursday
june
and
there
was
a
majority
of
against
the
ministry
the
moment
after
sir
robert
peel
succeeded
in
passing
his
great
measure
of
free
trade
he
himself
fell
from
power
his
political
epitaph
perhaps
could
not
be
better
written
than
in
the
words
with
which
he
closed
the
speech
that
just
preceded
his
fall
it
may
be
that
i
shall
leave
a
name
sometimes
remembered
with
expressions
of
in
those
places
which
are
the
abode
of
men
whose
lot
it
is
to
labor
and
to
earn
their
daily
bread
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
a
name
remembered
with
expressions
of
when
they
shall
recreate
their
exhausted
strength
with
abundant
and
untaxed
food
the
sweeter
because
it
is
no
longer
leavened
with
a
sense
of
injustice
with
the
fall
of
the
principle
of
the
protection
in
corn
may
be
said
to
have
practically
fallen
the
principle
of
protection
in
that
country
altogether
that
principle
was
a
little
complicated
in
regard
to
the
sugar
duties
and
to
the
navigation
laws
the
sugar
produced
in
the
west
indian
colonies
was
allowed
to
enter
that
country
at
rates
of
duty
much
lower
than
those
imposed
upon
the
sugar
grown
in
foreign
lands
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
colonies
had
made
labor
there
somewhat
costly
and
difficult
to
obtain
continuously
and
the
impression
was
that
if
the
duties
on
foreign
sugar
were
reduced
it
would
tend
to
enable
those
countries
which
still
maintained
the
slave
trade
to
compete
at
great
advantage
with
the
sugar
grown
in
the
colonies
by
that
free
labor
to
establish
which
england
had
but
just
paid
so
large
a
pecuniary
fine
therefore
the
question
of
free
trade
became
involved
with
that
of
free
labor
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
the
eyes
of
many
a
man
who
was
not
inclined
to
support
the
protective
principle
in
itself
when
it
was
put
to
him
whether
he
was
willing
to
push
the
principle
so
far
as
to
allow
countries
growing
sugar
by
slave
labor
to
drive
our
sugar
out
of
the
market
he
was
often
inclined
to
give
way
before
this
mode
of
putting
the
question
and
to
imagine
that
there
really
was
a
collision
between
free
trade
and
free
labor
therefore
a
certain
sentimental
plea
came
in
to
aid
the
protectionists
in
regard
to
the
sugar
duties
many
of
the
old
antislavery
party
found
themselves
deceived
by
this
fallacy
and
inclined
to
join
the
agitation
against
the
reduction
of
the
duty
on
foreign
sugar
on
the
other
hand
it
was
made
tolerably
clear
that
the
labor
was
not
so
scarce
or
so
dear
in
the
colonies
as
had
been
represented
and
that
colonial
sugar
grown
by
free
labor
really
suffered
from
no
inconvenience
except
the
fact
that
it
was
still
manufactured
on
the
most
crude
and
uneconomical
methods
besides
the
time
had
gone
by
when
the
majority
of
the
english
people
could
be
convinced
that
a
lesson
on
the
beauty
of
freedom
was
to
be
conveyed
to
foreign
and
by
the
means
of
a
tax
upon
the
products
of
their
plantations
therefore
after
a
long
and
somewhat
eager
struggle
the
principle
of
free
trade
was
allowed
to
prevail
in
regard
to
sugar
the
duties
on
sugar
were
made
equal
the
growth
of
the
sugar
plantations
was
admitted
on
the
same
terms
into
that
country
without
any
reference
either
to
the
soil
from
which
it
had
sprung
or
to
the
conditions
under
which
it
was
grown
it
had
for
a
long
time
been
stoutly
proclaimed
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
must
be
the
destruction
of
our
west
indian
colonies
years
had
elapsed
and
the
west
indian
colonies
still
survived
now
the
cry
of
alarm
was
taken
up
again
and
it
was
prophesied
that
although
they
had
got
over
the
abolition
of
slavery
they
never
could
survive
the
equalization
of
the
sugar
duties
jamaica
certainly
had
fallen
greatly
away
from
her
period
of
temporary
and
factitious
prosperity
jamaica
was
owned
and
managed
by
a
class
of
proprietors
who
resembled
in
many
ways
some
of
the
planters
of
the
states
of
america
farthest
south
of
the
states
toward
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
they
lived
in
a
kind
of
careless
luxury
mortgaging
their
estates
as
deeply
as
they
possibly
could
throwing
over
to
the
coming
year
the
superabundant
debts
of
the
last
and
only
managing
to
keep
their
heads
above
water
so
long
as
the
people
of
england
by
favoring
them
with
a
highly
protective
system
enabled
them
still
to
compete
against
those
who
grew
sugar
on
better
and
more
economical
plans
the
whole
island
was
given
over
to
neglect
and
mismanagement
the
emancipated
negroes
took
but
little
trouble
to
cultivate
the
plots
of
ground
they
had
obtained
and
were
quite
content
if
they
could
scratch
enough
from
the
soil
to
enable
them
barely
to
live
therefore
jamaica
did
at
a
certain
time
fall
far
below
the
level
of
her
former
seeming
prosperity
the
other
islands
had
been
better
managed
their
estates
were
less
encumbered
by
debt
and
they
passed
through
each
successive
crisis
without
sustaining
any
noticeable
injury
in
most
of
these
islands
the
product
increased
steadily
after
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
the
negroes
then
began
to
work
earnestly
and
education
grew
not
greatly
but
distinctly
among
all
classes
jamaica
the
most
unfortunate
among
the
islands
has
been
constantly
the
scene
of
little
outbursts
of
more
or
less
serious
rebellion
as
the
late
lord
chief
justice
of
england
observed
in
a
charge
on
a
famous
occasion
the
soil
of
the
island
might
seem
to
have
been
drenched
in
blood
but
these
disturbances
or
insurrections
or
whatever
they
may
be
called
did
not
increase
in
number
after
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
after
the
equalization
of
the
sugar
duties
but
on
the
contrary
decreased
during
our
time
only
one
considerable
disturbance
has
taken
place
in
jamaica
and
in
former
years
such
tumult
was
of
frequent
recurrence
in
the
west
indies
we
have
therefore
the
most
severe
test
to
which
the
principle
of
free
trade
could
well
be
subjected
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
in
the
more
fortunate
of
these
islands
it
has
established
its
claim
and
that
even
in
the
least
fortunate
no
evidence
whatever
has
been
given
that
the
people
would
have
been
in
any
way
the
better
off
if
the
old
system
had
been
retained
the
navigation
laws
had
too
a
certain
external
attraction
about
them
which
induced
many
men
not
actually
protectionists
to
believe
in
their
necessity
the
principle
of
the
navigation
laws
was
to
impose
such
restrictions
of
tariff
and
otherwise
as
to
exclude
foreign
vessels
from
taking
any
considerable
part
in
our
carrying
trade
the
law
was
first
enacted
in
oliver
cromwell
day
at
a
time
when
the
dutch
were
rivals
on
the
sea
and
when
it
was
thought
desirable
to
repress
by
protective
legislation
the
energy
of
such
experienced
seamen
and
pushing
traders
the
navigation
law
was
modified
by
huskisson
in
but
only
so
far
as
to
establish
that
which
we
now
know
so
well
as
the
principle
of
reciprocity
any
nation
which
removed
restrictions
from
british
merchant
marine
was
favored
with
a
similar
concession
the
idea
also
was
that
these
navigation
laws
keeping
foreigners
out
of
england
carrying
trade
enabled
her
to
maintain
always
a
supply
of
sailors
who
could
at
any
time
be
transferred
from
the
merchant
marine
to
the
royal
navy
and
thus
be
made
to
assist
in
the
defence
of
the
country
of
course
the
themselves
upheld
the
navigation
laws
on
the
plea
that
if
the
trade
were
thrown
open
by
the
withdrawal
of
protection
their
chances
would
be
gone
that
they
could
not
contend
against
the
foreigners
upon
equal
terms
that
their
interests
must
suffer
and
that
great
britain
would
in
the
end
be
a
still
severer
sufferer
because
from
the
lack
of
encouragement
given
to
the
native
traders
and
the
sailors
england
would
one
day
or
another
be
left
at
the
mercy
of
some
strong
power
which
with
wiser
regulations
would
keep
up
her
protective
system
and
with
it
her
naval
strength
nevertheless
the
and
the
protectionists
and
those
who
raised
the
about
england
naval
defences
were
unable
to
maintain
their
sophisms
in
the
face
of
growing
education
and
of
the
impulse
given
by
the
adoption
of
free
trade
in
the
navigation
laws
were
abolished
we
believe
there
are
very
few
who
will
not
now
admit
that
the
prosperity
of
their
trade
has
grown
immensely
in
place
of
suffering
from
the
introduction
of
the
principle
in
navigation
as
well
as
in
com
and
sugar
the
discovery
of
neptune
sir
oliver
lodge
among
modern
astronomical
discoveries
none
has
been
regarded
as
more
important
than
that
of
neptune
the
outermost
known
planet
of
the
solar
system
it
was
a
rich
reward
to
the
watchers
of
the
sky
when
this
new
planet
swam
into
their
ken
this
discovery
was
hailed
by
astronomers
as
the
most
conspicuous
triumph
of
the
theory
of
gravitation
long
after
copernicus
even
the
genius
of
philosophers
was
slow
to
grasp
the
full
conception
of
a
spherical
earth
and
its
relations
with
the
heavenly
bodies
as
presented
by
him
so
it
was
also
with
the
final
acceptance
of
newton
demonstration
of
the
universal
law
of
gravitation
whereby
he
showed
that
the
motions
of
the
solar
system
were
due
to
the
action
of
a
central
force
directed
to
the
body
at
the
centre
of
the
system
and
varying
inversely
with
the
square
of
the
distance
from
it
after
making
this
discovery
newton
himself
with
the
aid
of
others
especially
of
the
french
mathematician
picard
labored
for
years
to
verify
it
and
still
further
verification
was
necessary
before
it
could
be
fully
comprehended
and
accepted
by
the
scientific
world
the
discovery
of
the
asteroids
or
small
planets
revolving
in
orbits
between
those
of
mars
and
jupiter
aided
in
confirming
the
newtonian
theory
which
the
discovery
of
uranus
by
sir
william
herschel
had
done
much
to
establish
from
the
time
of
sir
william
herschel
the
science
of
stellar
astronomy
revealing
the
enormous
distances
of
the
stars
none
of
them
really
fixed
but
all
having
real
or
apparent
motions
was
rapidly
developed
the
discovery
of
stellar
planets
at
almost
incalculable
distances
still
further
changed
the
aspect
of
the
heavens
as
viewed
by
astronomers
and
when
the
capital
discovery
of
neptune
was
made
those
men
of
science
were
well
prepared
for
studying
its
nature
and
importance
these
matters
as
well
as
the
simultaneous
calculation
of
the
place
of
neptune
by
adams
and
leverrier
and
its
actual
discovery
by
galle
are
set
forth
by
sir
oliver
lodge
in
a
manner
as
charming
for
simplicity
as
it
is
valuable
in
its
summary
of
scientific
learning
the
explanation
by
newton
of
the
observed
facts
of
the
motion
of
the
moon
the
way
he
accounted
for
precession
and
nutation
and
for
the
tides
the
way
in
which
laplace
explained
every
detail
of
the
planetary
motions
these
achievements
may
seem
to
the
professional
astronomer
equally
if
not
more
striking
and
wonderful
but
of
the
facts
to
be
explained
in
these
cases
the
general
public
is
necessarily
more
or
less
ignorant
and
so
no
beauty
or
thoroughness
of
treatment
appeals
to
it
or
excites
its
imagination
but
to
predict
in
the
solitude
of
the
study
with
no
weapons
other
than
pen
ink
and
paper
an
unknown
and
enormously
distant
world
to
calculate
its
orbit
when
as
yet
it
had
never
been
seen
and
to
be
able
to
say
to
a
practical
astronomer
point
your
telescope
in
such
a
direction
at
such
a
time
and
you
will
see
a
new
planet
hitherto
unknown
to
man
this
must
always
appeal
to
the
imagination
with
dramatic
intensity
and
must
awaken
some
interest
in
the
dullest
prediction
is
no
novelty
in
science
and
in
astronomy
least
of
all
is
it
a
novelty
thousands
of
years
ago
thales
and
others
whose
very
names
we
have
forgotten
could
predict
eclipses
but
not
without
a
certain
degree
of
inaccuracy
and
many
other
phenomena
were
capable
of
prediction
by
accumulated
experience
a
gap
between
mars
and
jupiter
caused
a
missing
planet
to
be
suspected
and
looked
for
and
to
be
found
in
a
hundred
pieces
the
abnormal
of
sirius
suggested
to
bessel
the
existence
of
an
unseen
companion
and
these
last
instances
seem
to
approach
very
near
the
same
class
of
prediction
as
that
of
the
discovery
of
neptune
wherein
then
lies
the
difference
how
comes
it
that
some
classes
of
prediction
such
as
that
if
you
put
your
finger
in
fire
it
will
be
burned
are
childishly
easy
and
commonplace
while
others
excite
in
the
keenest
intellects
the
highest
feelings
of
admiration
mainly
the
difference
lies
first
in
the
grounds
on
which
the
prediction
is
based
second
in
the
difficulty
of
the
investigation
whereby
it
is
accomplished
third
in
the
completeness
and
the
accuracy
with
which
it
can
be
verified
in
all
these
points
the
discovery
of
neptune
stands
out
as
one
among
the
many
verified
predictions
of
science
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
it
are
of
singular
interest
three
distinct
observations
suffice
to
determine
the
orbit
of
a
planet
completely
but
it
is
well
to
have
the
three
observations
as
far
apart
as
possible
so
as
to
minimize
the
effects
of
minute
but
necessary
errors
of
observation
when
uranus
was
found
old
records
of
stellar
observations
were
ransacked
with
the
object
of
discovering
whether
it
had
ever
been
unwittingly
seen
before
if
seen
it
had
been
thought
of
course
to
be
a
star
for
it
shines
like
a
star
of
the
sixth
magnitude
and
can
therefore
be
just
seen
without
a
telescope
if
one
knows
precisely
where
to
look
for
it
and
if
one
has
good
sight
but
if
it
had
been
seen
and
catalogued
as
a
star
it
would
have
moved
from
its
place
and
the
catalogue
would
by
that
entry
be
wrong
the
thing
to
do
therefore
was
to
examine
all
the
catalogues
for
errors
to
see
whether
the
stars
entered
there
actually
existed
or
whether
any
were
missing
if
a
wrong
entry
were
discovered
it
might
of
course
have
been
due
to
some
clerical
error
though
that
is
hardly
probable
considering
the
care
spent
in
making
these
records
or
it
might
have
been
a
tailless
comet
or
possibly
the
newly
found
planet
the
next
thing
to
do
was
to
calculate
backward
to
see
whether
by
any
possibility
the
planet
could
have
been
in
that
place
at
that
time
examined
in
this
way
the
tabulated
observations
of
flamsteed
showed
that
he
had
unwittingly
observed
uranus
five
distinct
times
the
first
time
in
nearly
a
century
before
herschel
discovered
its
true
nature
but
more
remarkable
still
le
monnier
of
paris
had
observed
it
eight
times
in
one
month
cataloguing
it
each
time
as
a
different
star
if
only
he
had
reduced
and
compared
his
observations
he
would
have
anticipated
herschel
by
twelve
years
as
it
was
he
missed
it
it
was
seen
once
by
bradley
also
altogether
it
had
been
seen
twenty
times
these
old
observations
of
flamsteed
and
those
of
le
monnier
combined
with
those
made
after
herschel
discovery
were
very
useful
in
determining
an
exact
orbit
for
the
new
planet
and
its
motion
was
considered
thoroughly
known
for
a
time
uranus
seemed
to
travel
regularly
and
as
expected
in
the
orbit
which
had
been
calculated
for
it
but
early
in
the
present
century
it
began
to
be
slightly
refractory
and
by
its
actual
place
showed
quite
a
distinct
discrepancy
from
its
position
as
calculated
with
the
aid
of
the
old
observations
it
was
thought
at
first
that
this
discrepancy
must
be
due
to
inaccuracies
in
the
older
observations
and
they
were
accordingly
rejected
and
tables
prepared
for
the
planet
based
on
the
newer
and
more
accurate
observations
only
but
by
it
became
apparent
that
it
did
not
coincide
with
even
these
the
error
amounted
to
about
by
it
was
as
much
as
or
a
minute
and
a
half
this
discrepancy
is
quite
distinct
but
still
it
is
very
small
and
had
two
objects
been
in
the
heavens
at
once
the
actual
uranus
and
the
theoretical
uranus
no
unaided
eye
could
possibly
have
distinguished
them
or
detected
that
they
were
other
than
a
single
star
the
errors
of
uranus
though
small
were
enormously
greater
than
other
things
which
had
certainly
been
observed
there
was
an
unmistakable
discrepancy
between
theory
and
observation
some
cause
was
evidently
at
work
on
this
distant
planet
causing
it
to
disagree
with
its
motion
as
calculated
according
to
the
law
of
gravitation
if
the
law
of
gravitation
held
exactly
at
so
great
a
distance
from
the
sun
there
must
be
some
perturbing
force
acting
on
it
besides
all
the
known
forces
that
had
been
fully
taken
into
account
could
it
be
an
outer
planet
the
question
occurred
to
several
and
one
or
two
tried
to
solve
the
problem
but
were
soon
stopped
by
the
tremendous
difficulties
of
calculation
the
ordinary
problem
of
perturbation
is
difficult
enough
given
a
disturbing
planet
in
such
and
such
a
position
to
find
the
perturbations
it
produces
this
was
the
problem
that
laplace
worked
out
in
the
but
the
inverse
problem
given
the
perturbations
to
find
the
planet
that
causes
them
such
a
problem
had
never
yet
been
attacked
and
by
only
a
few
had
its
possibility
been
conceived
friedrich
bessel
made
preparations
for
solving
this
mystery
in
but
he
was
prevented
by
fatal
illness
in
the
difficulties
of
the
problem
presented
by
these
residual
perturbations
of
uranus
excited
the
imagination
of
a
young
student
an
undergraduate
of
cambridge
john
couch
adams
by
name
and
he
determined
to
make
a
study
of
them
as
soon
as
he
was
through
his
in
january
he
was
graduated
as
senior
wrangler
and
shortly
afterward
he
set
to
work
in
less
than
two
years
he
reached
a
definite
conclusion
and
in
october
he
wrote
to
the
at
greenwich
professor
airy
saying
that
the
perturbations
of
uranus
could
be
explained
by
assuming
the
existence
of
an
outer
planet
which
he
reckoned
was
now
situated
in
a
specified
latitude
and
longitude
we
know
now
that
had
the
put
sufficient
faith
in
this
result
to
point
his
big
telescope
at
the
spot
indicated
and
begin
sweeping
for
a
planet
he
would
have
detected
it
within
of
the
place
assigned
to
it
by
adams
but
anyone
in
the
situation
of
the
knows
that
almost
every
post
brings
absurd
letters
from
ambitious
correspondents
some
of
them
having
just
discovered
perpetual
motion
or
squared
the
circle
or
proved
the
earth
flat
or
discovered
the
constitution
of
the
moon
or
of
ether
or
of
electricity
and
in
this
mass
of
rubbish
it
requires
great
skill
and
patience
to
detect
such
gems
of
value
as
may
exist
now
this
letter
of
adams
was
indeed
a
jewel
of
the
first
water
and
no
doubt
bore
on
its
face
a
very
different
appearance
from
the
chaff
of
which
i
have
spoken
but
still
adams
was
unknown
he
had
been
graduated
as
senior
wrangler
it
is
true
but
somebody
must
be
graduated
as
senior
wrangler
every
year
and
a
mathematician
is
not
produced
every
year
those
behind
the
scenes
as
professor
airy
of
course
was
having
been
a
senior
wrangler
himself
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
labeling
of
a
young
man
on
his
taking
his
degree
is
much
more
worthless
as
a
testimony
to
his
genius
and
ability
than
the
general
public
is
apt
to
suppose
was
it
likely
that
a
young
and
unknown
man
should
have
solved
so
extremely
difficult
a
problem
it
was
altogether
unlikely
still
he
should
be
tested
he
should
be
asked
for
explanations
concerning
some
of
the
perturbations
which
professor
airy
had
noticed
and
see
whether
he
could
explain
these
also
by
his
hypothesis
if
he
could
there
might
be
something
in
his
theory
if
he
failed
well
there
was
an
end
of
it
the
questions
were
not
difficult
they
concerned
the
error
of
the
radius
vector
adams
could
have
answered
them
with
perfect
ease
but
sad
to
say
though
a
brilliant
mathematician
he
was
not
a
man
of
business
he
did
not
answer
professor
airy
letter
it
may
seem
a
pity
to
many
that
the
greenwich
equatorial
was
not
pointed
at
the
place
just
to
see
whether
any
foreign
object
did
happen
to
be
in
that
neighborhood
but
it
is
no
light
matter
to
derange
the
work
of
an
observatory
and
alter
the
plans
laid
out
for
the
staff
into
a
sudden
sweep
for
a
new
planet
on
the
strength
of
a
mathematical
investigation
just
received
by
post
if
observatories
were
conducted
on
these
unsystematic
and
spasmodic
principles
they
would
not
be
the
calm
accurate
satisfactory
places
they
are
of
course
if
anyone
had
known
that
a
new
planet
was
to
be
found
for
the
looking
course
would
have
been
justified
but
no
one
could
know
this
i
do
not
suppose
that
adams
himself
felt
an
absolute
confidence
in
his
attempted
prediction
so
there
the
matter
dropped
communication
was
pigeonholed
and
remained
in
seclusion
eight
or
nine
months
meanwhile
and
quite
independently
something
of
the
same
sort
was
going
on
in
france
a
brilliant
young
mathematician
urban
jean
joseph
leverrier
born
in
normandy
in
held
the
post
of
astronomical
professor
at
the
école
polytechnique
founded
by
napoleon
his
first
published
papers
directed
attention
to
his
wonderful
powers
and
the
official
head
of
astronomy
in
france
the
famous
arago
suggested
to
him
the
unexplained
perturbations
of
uranus
as
a
worthy
object
for
his
fresh
and
vigor
at
once
he
set
to
work
in
a
thorough
and
systematic
way
he
first
considered
whether
the
discrepancies
could
be
due
to
errors
in
the
tables
or
errors
in
the
old
observations
he
discussed
them
with
minute
care
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
not
thus
to
be
explained
away
this
part
of
the
work
he
published
in
november
he
then
set
to
work
to
consider
the
perturbations
produced
by
jupiter
and
saturn
to
see
whether
they
had
been
accurately
allowed
for
or
whether
some
minute
improvements
could
be
made
sufficient
to
destroy
the
irregularities
he
introduced
several
fresh
terms
into
these
calculations
but
none
of
them
of
sufficient
importance
to
do
more
than
partly
explain
the
mysterious
perturbations
he
next
examined
the
various
hypotheses
that
had
been
suggested
to
account
for
them
were
they
caused
by
a
failure
in
the
law
of
gravitation
or
by
the
presence
of
a
resisting
medium
were
they
due
to
some
large
but
unseen
satellite
or
to
a
collision
with
some
comet
all
these
theories
he
examined
and
dismissed
for
various
reasons
the
perturbations
were
due
to
some
continuous
cause
for
instance
some
unknown
planet
could
this
planet
be
inside
the
orbit
of
uranus
no
for
then
it
would
perturb
saturn
and
jupiter
also
and
they
were
not
perturbed
by
it
it
must
therefore
be
some
planet
outside
the
orbit
of
uranus
and
in
all
probability
according
to
bode
empirical
law
at
nearly
double
the
distance
from
the
sun
that
uranus
is
finally
he
proceeded
to
determine
where
this
planet
was
and
what
its
orbit
must
be
to
produce
the
observed
disturbances
not
without
failures
and
disheartening
complications
was
this
part
of
the
process
completed
this
was
after
all
the
real
tug
of
war
many
unknown
quantities
existed
its
mass
its
distance
its
eccentricity
the
obliquity
of
its
orbit
its
position
nothing
was
known
in
fact
about
the
planet
except
the
microscopic
disturbance
it
caused
in
uranus
several
thousand
million
miles
away
from
it
without
going
into
further
detail
suffice
it
to
say
that
in
june
he
published
his
last
paper
and
in
it
announced
to
the
world
his
theory
as
to
the
situation
of
the
planet
professor
airy
received
a
copy
of
this
paper
before
the
end
of
the
month
and
was
astonished
to
find
that
leverrier
theoretical
place
for
the
planet
was
within
of
the
place
adams
had
assigned
to
it
eight
months
before
so
striking
a
coincidence
seemed
sufficient
to
justify
a
herschelian
sweep
for
a
week
or
two
but
a
sweep
for
so
distant
a
planet
would
be
no
easy
matter
when
seen
through
a
large
telescope
it
would
still
only
look
like
a
star
and
it
would
require
considerable
labor
and
watching
to
sift
it
out
from
the
other
stars
surrounding
it
we
know
that
uranus
had
been
seen
twenty
times
and
thought
to
be
a
star
before
its
true
nature
was
discovered
by
herschel
and
uranus
is
only
about
half
as
far
away
as
neptune
neither
at
paris
nor
at
greenwich
was
any
optical
search
undertaken
but
professor
airy
wrote
to
ask
leverrier
the
same
old
question
that
he
had
fruitlessly
put
to
adams
did
the
new
theory
explain
the
errors
of
the
radius
vector
or
not
the
reply
of
leverrier
was
both
prompt
and
satisfactory
these
errors
were
explained
as
well
as
all
the
others
the
existence
of
the
object
was
then
for
the
first
time
officially
believed
in
the
british
association
met
that
year
at
southampton
and
sir
john
herschel
was
one
of
its
sectional
presidents
in
his
inaugural
address
on
september
he
called
attention
to
the
researches
of
leverrier
and
adams
in
these
memorable
words
the
past
year
has
given
to
us
the
new
minor
planet
astræa
it
has
done
more
it
has
given
us
the
probable
prospect
of
another
we
see
it
as
columbus
saw
america
from
the
shores
of
spain
its
movements
have
been
felt
trembling
along
the
line
of
our
analysis
with
a
certainty
hardly
inferior
to
ocular
demonstration
it
was
nearly
time
to
begin
to
look
for
it
so
the
thought
on
reading
leverrier
paper
but
as
the
national
telescope
at
greenwich
was
otherwise
occupied
he
wrote
to
professor
challis
at
cambridge
to
know
whether
he
would
permit
a
search
to
be
made
for
it
with
the
northumberland
equatorial
the
large
telescope
at
cambridge
university
presented
to
it
by
one
of
the
dukes
of
northumberland
professor
challis
said
he
would
conduct
the
search
himself
and
shortly
began
a
leisurely
and
dignified
series
of
sweeps
around
the
place
designated
by
theory
cataloguing
all
the
stars
he
observed
intending
afterward
to
sort
out
his
observations
compare
one
with
another
and
find
out
whether
any
one
star
had
changed
its
position
because
if
it
had
it
must
be
the
planet
thus
without
giving
an
excessive
time
to
the
business
he
accumulated
a
host
of
observations
professor
challis
thus
actually
saw
the
planet
twice
on
august
and
august
without
knowing
it
if
he
had
had
a
map
of
the
heavens
containing
telescopic
stars
down
to
the
tenth
magnitude
and
if
he
had
compared
his
observations
with
this
map
as
they
were
made
the
process
would
have
been
easy
and
the
discovery
quick
but
he
had
no
such
map
nevertheless
one
was
in
existence
it
had
just
been
completed
in
that
country
of
enlightened
method
and
industry
germany
doctor
bremiker
had
not
indeed
completed
his
great
work
a
chart
of
the
whole
zodiac
down
to
stars
of
the
tenth
magnitude
but
portions
of
it
were
completed
and
the
special
region
where
the
new
planet
was
expected
to
appear
happened
to
be
among
the
portions
finished
but
in
england
this
was
not
known
meanwhile
adams
wrote
to
the
several
additional
communications
making
improvements
in
his
theory
and
giving
what
he
considered
nearer
and
nearer
approximations
for
the
place
of
the
planet
he
also
now
answered
quite
satisfactorily
but
too
late
the
question
about
the
radius
vector
sent
to
him
months
before
leverrier
was
likewise
engaged
in
improving
this
theory
and
in
considering
how
best
the
optical
search
could
be
conducted
actuated
probably
by
the
knowledge
that
in
such
matters
as
cataloguing
and
mapping
germany
was
then
as
now
far
ahead
of
all
the
other
nations
he
wrote
in
september
the
same
year
that
sir
john
herschel
delivered
his
eloquent
address
at
southampton
to
berlin
leverrier
wrote
to
doctor
galle
head
of
the
observatory
at
berlin
saying
to
him
clearly
and
decidedly
that
the
new
planet
was
now
in
or
close
to
such
and
such
a
position
and
that
if
he
would
point
his
telescope
to
that
part
of
the
heavens
he
would
see
it
and
moreover
that
he
would
be
able
to
tell
it
from
a
star
by
its
having
a
sensible
magnitude
or
disk
instead
of
being
a
mere
point
galle
got
the
letter
on
september
that
same
evening
he
pointed
his
telescope
to
the
place
leverrier
told
him
and
saw
the
planet
he
recognized
it
first
by
its
appearance
to
his
practised
eye
it
did
seem
to
have
a
small
disk
and
not
quite
the
same
aspect
as
an
ordinary
star
he
then
consulted
bremiker
great
the
part
just
engraved
and
finished
and
sure
enough
no
such
star
was
there
undoubtedly
it
was
the
planet
the
news
flashed
over
europe
at
the
maximum
speed
with
which
news
could
travel
at
that
date
which
was
not
very
fast
and
by
october
professor
challis
and
adams
heard
it
at
cambridge
and
realized
that
in
so
far
as
there
was
competition
in
such
a
matter
england
was
out
of
the
race
it
was
an
unconscious
race
to
all
concerned
however
the
french
scientists
knew
nothing
of
the
search
in
england
adams
papers
had
never
been
published
and
very
annoyed
the
french
were
when
a
claim
was
set
up
in
his
behalf
to
a
share
in
this
magnificent
discovery
as
for
adams
himself
we
are
told
that
by
no
word
did
he
show
resentment
at
the
loss
of
the
practical
consummation
of
his
discovery
his
part
in
any
controversy
that
arose
was
calm
and
dignified
but
for
a
time
his
friends
fought
a
public
battle
for
his
fame
it
so
happened
that
the
public
took
a
keener
interest
than
it
usually
takes
in
scientific
predictions
but
the
discussion
has
now
settled
down
all
the
world
honors
the
bright
genius
and
mathematical
skill
of
john
couch
adams
and
recognizes
that
he
first
solved
the
problem
by
calculation
all
the
world
too
perceives
clearly
the
no
less
eminent
mathematical
talents
of
leverrier
but
it
recognizes
in
him
something
more
than
the
mere
mathematician
the
man
of
energy
decision
and
character
the
acquisition
of
california
henry
dawson
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
the
acquisition
of
california
carrying
with
it
that
of
new
mexico
was
a
peculiar
and
unusual
event
and
one
of
immense
significance
in
the
expansion
and
development
of
the
republic
together
with
the
annexation
of
texas
it
was
the
most
important
result
of
the
mexican
war
the
california
country
formerly
an
indeterminate
territory
of
vast
extent
was
settled
by
spanish
missionaries
in
the
seventeenth
century
their
settlements
within
the
present
limits
of
the
state
of
california
date
from
the
first
foundation
of
san
diego
in
in
the
entire
region
called
california
became
a
part
of
the
mexican
republic
and
it
remained
a
possession
of
mexico
until
the
time
of
the
transfer
described
below
at
the
beginning
of
the
population
of
california
included
with
about
two
hundred
thousand
indians
six
thousand
mexicans
and
perhaps
two
hundred
americans
war
against
mexico
had
been
declared
in
may
and
already
general
taylor
had
won
the
battles
of
palo
alto
and
resaca
de
la
palma
and
had
compelled
the
surrender
of
monterey
while
these
operations
were
leading
the
united
states
forces
to
the
rapid
accomplishment
of
their
work
in
mexico
proper
other
movements
were
undertaken
the
execution
and
outcome
of
which
form
the
subject
of
dawson
narrative
in
california
and
new
mexico
were
ceded
to
the
united
states
immediately
after
the
opening
of
hostilities
in
the
valley
of
the
rio
grande
march
among
the
expeditions
which
were
organized
by
the
federal
authorities
was
one
to
move
against
and
take
possession
of
california
and
new
mexico
two
provinces
in
the
northern
part
of
the
enemy
country
the
command
of
this
expedition
had
been
vested
in
general
stephen
kearney
and
the
force
under
his
command
had
rendezvoused
at
fort
leavenworth
and
the
most
energetic
measures
had
been
adopted
to
insure
its
early
departure
and
its
ultimate
success
having
completed
all
the
arrangements
on
june
the
main
body
of
this
expedition
had
moved
from
the
fort
and
after
a
rapid
but
interesting
march
of
eight
hundred
miles
on
august
it
entered
and
took
possession
of
santa
fé
the
capital
of
new
mexico
the
mexican
forces
numbering
four
thousand
which
had
been
collected
to
defend
the
town
having
dispersed
without
offering
the
least
opposition
as
it
approached
while
these
operations
in
new
mexico
and
on
the
western
frontier
of
the
united
states
were
taking
place
john
frémont
who
had
been
engaged
in
explorations
on
the
western
slope
of
the
rocky
mountains
had
also
revolutionized
the
province
of
california
and
to
some
extent
at
least
had
anticipated
the
movements
of
the
expedition
commanded
by
general
kearney
the
character
of
his
mission
being
scientific
and
peaceful
rather
than
warlike
he
had
not
had
an
officer
or
soldier
of
the
regular
army
in
his
company
and
his
whole
force
had
consisted
of
men
employed
by
himself
for
security
against
the
indians
and
for
procuring
subsistence
in
the
wilderness
and
desert
country
through
which
he
had
passed
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
game
for
his
men
and
grass
for
his
horses
in
an
uninhabited
part
of
california
he
had
during
the
winter
of
solicited
and
obtained
permission
from
the
mexican
authorities
to
winter
in
the
valley
of
san
joaquin
but
he
had
scarcely
established
himself
before
he
received
advices
that
the
mexican
commander
was
preparing
to
attack
him
under
the
pretext
that
under
the
cover
of
a
scientific
mission
he
was
exciting
the
american
settlers
in
that
vicinity
to
revolt
in
view
of
this
threatened
attack
and
for
the
purpose
of
repelling
it
lieutenant
frémont
immediately
occupied
a
mountain
which
overlooked
monterey
although
it
was
thirty
miles
from
that
city
and
having
intrenched
it
and
raised
the
flag
of
the
united
states
he
waited
the
approach
of
the
enemy
after
remaining
there
until
march
he
retired
to
the
northward
intending
to
march
by
way
of
oregon
to
the
united
states
but
about
the
middle
of
may
after
he
had
quietly
passed
into
oregon
he
had
received
information
through
samuel
neal
and
levi
sigler
two
hunters
who
had
been
sent
after
him
from
lassen
that
the
mexican
governor
of
california
was
pursuing
him
while
the
indians
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
instigated
by
the
enemy
had
shown
signs
of
hostility
and
had
killed
or
wounded
five
of
his
men
under
these
circumstances
on
june
lieutenant
frémont
had
resolved
to
turn
on
his
pursuers
with
the
little
party
under
his
command
and
to
seek
safety
not
merely
in
the
overthrow
of
his
pursuers
but
in
that
of
the
entire
government
of
mexico
in
the
province
of
california
accordingly
on
june
lieutenant
frémont
assisted
by
captain
merritt
and
fourteen
of
the
settlers
had
attacked
and
captured
an
escort
of
horses
destined
for
general
troops
lieutenant
arce
fourteen
men
and
two
hundred
horses
remaining
in
his
hands
as
the
trophies
of
his
victory
on
the
the
military
post
of
sonoma
was
surprised
and
general
vallejo
captain
vallejo
colonel
greuxdon
and
several
other
officers
nine
pieces
of
brass
cannon
two
hundred
fifty
stands
of
muskets
and
other
stores
and
arms
were
taken
and
on
the
the
military
commandant
of
the
province
who
had
moved
toward
the
post
with
a
heavy
force
to
retake
it
was
attacked
by
lieutenant
frémont
and
twenty
men
and
completely
routed
having
thus
cleared
that
part
of
the
province
north
of
the
bay
of
san
francisco
of
the
enemy
it
is
said
that
on
july
captain
frémont
had
assembled
the
american
settlers
at
sonoma
addressed
them
upon
the
dangers
of
their
situation
and
recommended
a
declaration
of
independence
and
war
on
mexico
as
the
only
remedy
and
that
the
hardy
frontiersmen
promptly
accepted
the
proposal
and
raised
the
flag
of
independent
california
a
bear
and
a
star
on
a
red
ground
while
these
revolutionary
movements
were
destroying
the
power
of
mexico
in
the
interior
of
the
province
of
california
and
the
expedition
under
general
kearney
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
work
had
been
done
already
was
approaching
its
eastern
borders
for
the
same
purpose
the
naval
force
of
the
united
states
in
the
pacific
under
commodore
sloat
had
been
assisting
in
the
work
of
conquest
having
heard
of
the
opening
of
hostilities
on
the
rio
grande
the
commodore
then
at
mazatlan
hastened
with
the
savannah
to
monterey
in
california
where
he
arrived
on
july
and
on
the
he
took
possession
of
the
town
without
opposition
the
was
seized
the
american
flag
raised
and
california
declared
to
be
henceforward
a
part
of
the
united
states
within
a
few
days
intelligence
of
the
action
of
commodore
sloat
was
received
by
the
revolutionary
leaders
at
sonoma
and
a
battalion
of
mounted
riflemen
which
had
been
organized
among
them
was
immediately
moved
to
monterey
the
flag
of
the
united
states
was
substituted
for
the
bear
and
star
and
the
authority
of
the
commodore
was
immediately
recognized
this
battalion
of
mounted
riflemen
on
its
arrival
at
monterey
july
was
mustered
into
the
service
of
the
united
states
by
commodore
stockton
who
had
succeeded
commodore
sloat
in
command
of
the
squadron
captain
frémont
being
appointed
its
commandant
and
lieutenant
gillespie
of
the
marines
its
second
officer
and
it
was
immediately
despatched
on
the
cyane
to
san
diego
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
off
the
retreat
of
general
castro
of
the
mexican
service
who
had
encamped
and
fortified
his
position
near
ciudad
de
los
angeles
while
the
commodore
with
his
sailors
who
landed
from
the
congress
at
san
pedro
moved
against
him
in
front
the
expedition
was
eminently
successful
as
the
mexicans
on
the
approach
of
the
commodore
immediately
evacuated
their
camp
and
fled
in
the
greatest
confusion
although
most
of
the
principal
officers
were
subsequently
captured
and
on
august
the
ciudad
de
los
angeles
was
occupied
again
without
opposition
by
the
american
troops
and
seamen
and
the
conquest
of
california
was
apparently
completed
a
short
time
afterward
commodore
stockton
appointed
captain
frémont
governor
of
the
territory
into
which
by
the
proclamation
of
commodore
sloat
the
province
had
been
transformed
while
captain
gillespie
was
left
with
nineteen
men
in
possession
of
los
angeles
lieutenant
talbot
of
the
topographical
engineers
with
nine
men
was
left
at
santa
barbara
and
with
his
squadron
commodore
stockton
proceeded
to
san
francisco
while
governor
frémont
on
september
also
moved
to
monterey
the
main
body
had
no
sooner
left
los
angeles
than
the
californians
who
before
the
departure
of
the
commodore
and
the
governor
had
held
secret
meetings
for
the
purpose
rose
in
arms
for
the
expulsion
of
the
invaders
of
their
country
indeed
an
attempt
appears
to
have
been
intended
before
the
governor
left
the
city
but
by
timely
precautions
it
had
been
prevented
although
the
purpose
and
determination
still
continued
and
were
called
into
requisition
at
a
more
convenient
season
the
necessary
preparations
having
been
made
for
that
purpose
under
the
directions
of
josé
antonio
carrillo
a
professed
conspirator
of
that
vicinity
at
an
early
hour
on
the
morning
of
september
the
quarters
of
captain
gillespie
were
attacked
by
cerbulo
varela
a
metamorphosed
captain
under
governor
frémont
at
the
head
of
men
under
cover
of
a
thick
fog
the
morning
was
auspicious
for
such
purposes
yet
the
captain
was
not
surprised
and
the
rifles
which
he
controlled
were
quickly
brought
to
bear
on
the
assailants
who
retired
soon
afterward
with
three
of
their
number
killed
and
several
wounded
and
at
daylight
the
remainder
were
driven
from
the
town
with
the
loss
of
several
taken
prisoners
by
a
few
men
under
lieutenant
hensley
and
doctor
gilchrist
of
the
navy
the
insurgents
who
were
thus
expelled
from
the
city
formed
a
nucleus
around
which
the
disaffected
gathered
and
as
the
party
gained
strength
day
by
day
it
harassed
the
little
garrison
and
killed
one
of
its
number
there
was
but
little
concert
of
action
in
its
ranks
however
and
as
the
rival
aspirants
to
power
struggled
for
authority
while
the
numbers
rapidly
increased
the
efficiency
of
the
insurgents
was
but
slightly
increased
at
length
in
a
spirit
of
compromise
captain
antonio
flores
was
urged
to
take
the
command
of
the
party
and
reluctantly
accepted
it
and
he
soon
found
himself
at
the
head
of
six
hundred
men
armed
with
lances
and
a
brass
light
and
well
mounted
in
the
mean
time
the
little
garrison
had
found
an
old
honeycombed
iron
and
had
drilled
out
the
spike
cleaned
and
mounted
it
and
by
melting
the
lead
pipes
of
a
distillery
had
provided
unknown
to
the
insurgents
thirty
rounds
of
ball
and
grape
for
it
two
other
pieces
having
been
added
to
this
on
the
following
day
the
little
garrison
and
its
gallant
commander
resolved
to
die
rather
than
surrender
notwithstanding
the
extreme
efforts
which
had
been
made
to
strengthen
its
position
and
the
great
fatigue
which
was
incident
thereto
to
render
his
little
party
still
more
secure
however
on
september
captain
gillespie
withdrew
his
command
from
his
quarters
in
the
city
and
occupied
a
height
which
commanded
it
when
he
strengthened
his
position
and
prepared
for
an
obstinate
defence
no
sooner
had
this
movement
been
effected
than
captain
flores
sent
don
eulogeo
celis
to
inquire
on
what
terms
captain
gillespie
would
surrender
the
city
and
that
officer
after
consulting
with
his
subordinates
answered
that
if
the
enemy
would
consent
that
he
should
march
out
of
the
city
with
the
honors
of
war
colors
flying
and
drums
beating
that
he
should
take
everything
with
him
that
he
should
be
furnished
with
means
for
transporting
his
baggage
and
provisions
at
his
own
expense
and
that
the
enemy
should
not
come
within
a
league
of
his
party
while
on
its
line
of
march
to
san
pedro
he
would
accept
those
terms
and
no
others
would
be
considered
and
captain
flores
should
be
held
responsible
for
any
damage
which
might
ensue
in
case
they
were
rejected
after
some
negotiations
these
terms
were
offered
by
captain
flores
and
accepted
by
captain
gillespie
and
on
september
the
garrison
began
its
march
reached
san
pedro
on
the
same
evening
and
on
october
embarked
on
the
vandalia
after
spiking
its
three
old
guns
an
exploit
which
when
the
circumstances
under
which
captain
gillespie
force
the
strength
of
his
opponent
and
the
temper
of
the
people
among
whom
he
moved
are
taken
into
consideration
may
well
be
ranked
as
one
of
the
most
brilliant
feats
of
that
remarkable
campaign
while
these
difficulties
were
surrounding
captain
gillespie
at
los
angeles
lieutenant
talbot
at
santa
barbara
with
his
nine
men
was
not
less
dangerously
situated
and
when
the
former
had
made
terms
with
the
insurgents
manuel
garpio
with
two
hundred
men
moved
against
lieutenant
talbot
surrounded
the
town
and
demanded
his
surrender
offering
two
hours
for
his
deliberation
as
the
men
had
resolved
that
they
would
not
give
up
their
arms
and
as
the
barracks
were
untenable
with
so
small
a
force
the
lieutenant
resolved
to
abandon
the
town
and
push
for
the
hills
and
strange
to
say
he
marshalled
his
men
and
marched
out
of
the
town
without
opposition
those
who
lay
on
the
road
retreated
to
the
main
force
which
was
on
the
lower
side
of
the
town
having
reached
the
hills
he
encamped
and
remained
there
eight
days
when
the
californians
endeavored
to
rout
him
out
but
were
repulsed
with
the
loss
of
a
horse
the
insurgents
then
offered
him
his
arms
and
freedom
if
he
would
engage
to
remain
neutral
in
the
anticipated
hostilities
but
he
sent
word
back
that
he
preferred
to
fight
they
next
built
fires
about
him
and
burned
him
out
but
in
doing
so
they
did
not
capture
or
injure
him
and
he
pushed
through
the
mountains
for
monterey
and
after
a
month
travel
in
which
he
endured
hardships
and
suffering
he
reached
that
place
in
safety
intelligence
of
the
insurrection
having
reached
commodore
stockton
at
san
francisco
and
frémont
at
sacramento
both
took
immediate
steps
to
check
its
progress
and
to
punish
the
offenders
in
conformity
with
the
commodore
orders
fremont
hastened
to
san
francisco
whence
he
embarked
with
one
hundred
sixty
men
on
the
ship
sterling
for
santa
barbara
to
which
port
the
frigate
savannah
captain
mervine
had
previously
been
ordered
while
on
the
same
day
the
commodore
in
person
sailed
for
the
same
port
in
the
congress
the
latter
vessel
reached
san
pedro
on
october
and
at
sunrise
on
the
captain
mervine
landed
with
his
seamen
and
marines
and
after
being
joined
by
captain
gillespie
and
his
little
party
he
found
himself
at
the
head
of
three
hundred
ten
men
as
brave
and
as
valiant
as
ever
were
led
to
battle
upon
any
field
at
eight
the
party
commenced
its
march
toward
los
angeles
captain
gillespie
being
in
advance
and
when
the
column
reached
the
hills
of
palo
verde
the
insurgents
showed
themselves
and
opened
a
fire
with
their
the
march
was
rapid
and
the
jolly
tars
unused
to
such
extended
journeys
appear
to
have
suffered
from
its
effects
in
consequence
of
which
although
the
enemy
gradually
fell
back
before
the
advancing
column
between
one
and
two
when
near
the
rancho
de
los
domingos
fourteen
miles
from
san
pedro
it
became
necessary
to
halt
and
encamp
for
the
night
as
may
have
been
expected
the
sailors
and
marines
were
ashore
and
the
strict
discipline
which
the
deck
had
inculcated
appears
to
have
been
left
on
board
the
frigate
as
a
necessary
consequence
the
camp
displayed
but
little
of
the
order
which
such
a
locality
should
have
insured
and
many
and
marvellous
were
the
adventures
of
that
night
while
on
the
other
hand
the
enemy
profited
by
the
delay
by
the
moral
effect
of
the
disorder
with
which
the
march
had
been
conducted
and
by
the
entire
absence
of
any
artillery
on
the
following
morning
at
daylight
the
column
was
again
put
in
motion
and
with
captain
gillespie
men
in
front
in
still
greater
disorder
than
on
the
preceding
day
it
moved
toward
los
angeles
twelve
miles
distant
it
had
marched
only
three
miles
when
posted
behind
a
small
stream
which
intersected
the
line
of
march
the
advance
of
the
insurgents
men
with
a
small
fieldpiece
under
josé
antonio
carrillo
was
discovered
in
front
and
as
the
column
approached
a
fire
was
opened
on
it
which
was
answered
with
a
characteristic
shout
the
volunteers
captain
gillespie
command
pressed
forward
and
by
taking
advantage
of
the
neighboring
shelter
they
drove
the
enemy
and
compelled
him
to
abandon
his
fieldpiece
but
before
it
could
be
reached
and
taken
possession
of
captain
mervine
gave
orders
to
withdraw
with
great
indignation
therefore
the
volunteers
discontinued
the
action
and
after
picking
up
his
killed
and
wounded
harassed
by
the
enemy
who
pressed
after
the
column
and
covered
by
the
volunteers
and
sixteen
marines
under
captain
gillespie
captain
mervine
slowly
and
sadly
fell
back
to
san
pedro
where
he
arrived
about
dark
on
the
same
day
thirteen
noble
tars
were
buried
on
the
island
in
front
of
san
pedro
the
victims
of
this
badly
managed
expedition
on
october
the
commodore
reached
san
pedro
frémont
meanwhile
having
returned
to
monterey
and
on
the
he
sailed
for
san
diego
which
had
been
invested
by
the
insurgents
and
needed
assistance
he
reached
that
port
a
few
days
afterward
and
with
the
assistance
of
captain
gillespie
command
the
besiegers
were
repelled
and
a
fort
was
erected
to
protect
the
town
from
similar
troubles
in
future
strenuous
efforts
were
made
to
obtain
horses
for
the
use
of
the
troops
with
some
degree
of
success
and
commodore
stockton
sailed
toward
san
pedro
again
during
this
temporary
absence
of
the
commodore
the
insurgents
appear
on
november
to
have
moved
against
san
diego
a
second
time
and
were
again
driven
back
by
captain
gillespie
and
the
volunteers
and
marines
under
his
command
and
on
december
a
messenger
came
into
the
town
bearing
a
letter
from
general
kearney
apprising
the
commodore
of
his
approach
and
expressing
a
wish
that
a
communication
might
be
opened
with
him
that
he
might
be
informed
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
california
it
appeared
that
after
the
general
had
taken
santa
fé
on
october
he
had
moved
from
that
city
with
the
regular
cavalry
which
he
had
brought
there
soon
afterward
october
he
had
reduced
his
force
to
one
hundred
men
sending
the
remainder
back
to
santa
fé
and
after
an
interesting
march
overland
on
december
he
had
reached
the
outpost
of
civilization
in
california
from
there
a
letter
had
been
despatched
to
san
diego
by
stokes
an
englishman
who
lived
in
a
neighboring
and
on
the
the
command
had
moved
fifteen
miles
nearer
to
the
city
on
the
receipt
of
general
kearney
letter
commodore
stockton
despatched
captain
gillespie
to
meet
him
with
a
letter
of
welcome
the
captain
was
accompanied
by
lieutenant
beale
midshipman
duncan
ten
seamen
captain
gibson
company
of
riflemen
men
and
a
fieldpiece
and
on
the
he
reached
the
general
camp
when
having
learned
on
his
way
that
the
insurgents
were
encamped
at
san
pasqual
nine
miles
from
the
camp
lieutenant
hammond
was
sent
out
by
general
kearney
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
position
at
a
very
early
hour
on
the
the
troops
were
put
in
motion
captain
johnston
with
twelve
dragoons
forming
the
the
main
body
of
the
general
party
under
captain
moore
following
next
after
which
moved
captain
gillespie
with
captain
gibson
and
his
small
company
and
lieutenant
davidson
with
the
general
howitzers
brought
up
the
rear
when
the
column
had
reached
a
hill
which
overlooked
the
valley
of
the
san
pasqual
the
insurgents
encampment
it
was
halted
and
the
general
gave
the
final
orders
to
his
command
one
thrust
of
the
sabre
is
worth
a
dozen
cuts
and
depend
upon
them
more
than
upon
the
carbines
and
rifles
without
further
delay
the
column
advanced
down
the
hill
and
as
soon
as
captain
johnston
had
struck
the
plain
with
his
twelve
dragoons
having
mistaken
the
purport
of
an
order
from
the
general
he
uttered
a
yell
and
without
waiting
for
the
support
of
the
main
body
dashed
on
the
heavy
ranks
of
the
enemy
falling
a
victim
of
his
own
indiscretion
the
main
body
hastened
by
a
flank
movement
down
the
hill
to
support
the
charge
of
the
advance
and
received
the
enemy
fire
from
an
indian
village
on
its
right
flank
but
the
enemy
waited
to
do
no
further
mischief
and
fled
from
the
charge
of
the
advance
before
the
line
could
be
formed
perceiving
the
defection
of
the
enemy
captain
moore
with
a
portion
of
his
command
pursued
the
fugitives
down
the
right
of
the
valley
while
captain
gillespie
with
his
volunteers
did
the
same
on
the
left
side
the
latter
taking
prisoner
pablo
beja
the
second
officer
in
this
pursuit
however
the
ranks
of
the
americans
were
greatly
broken
and
as
the
mexicans
far
outnumbered
them
they
soon
afterward
made
a
stand
using
their
lances
with
good
effect
captain
moore
fell
pierced
in
the
breast
by
nine
lances
the
general
was
severely
wounded
and
his
life
was
saved
from
an
attack
on
his
rear
by
a
ball
from
lieutenant
emory
captain

attacked
by
seven
californians
received
three
wounds
and
saved
himself
with
great
difficulty
captain
gibson
received
two
wounds
lieutenant
hammond
received
nine
lance
wounds
in
the
breast
and
many
others
were
severely
injured
for
five
minutes
the
enemy
held
the
ground
when
the
main
body
of
the
americans
having
come
up
he
again
turned
and
fled
in
this
spirited
affair
about
eighty
americans
were
engaged
while
of
the
californians
there
is
said
to
have
been
one
hundred
sixty
under
andreas
pico
of
the
former
captains
moore
and
johnston
lieutenant
hammond
and
sixteen
men
were
killed
and
general
kearney
captains
gillespie
and
gibson
lieutenant
warner
and
eleven
men
were
wounded
while
of
the
latter
it
is
said
were
killed
and
wounded
the
dead
were
buried
as
soon
as
night
closed
in
the
wounded
were
properly
attended
to
by
the
single
surgeon
who
was
with
the
party
and
ambulances
were
prepared
for
their
conveyance
to
san
diego
miles
distant
and
on
the
morning
of
the
the
order
to
march
was
given
the
column
taking
the
road
over
the
hills
and
leaving
the
river
san
bernardo
to
the
left
the
enemy
retiring
as
it
advanced
a
proper
regard
for
the
comfort
of
the
wounded
compelled
the
column
to
move
slowly
and
it
was
afternoon
before
it
reached
the
san
bernardo
snook
after
a
short
halt
at
that
place
the
column
moved
down
into
the
valley
and
immediately
afterward
the
hills
on
the
rear
of
the
column
around
the
were
covered
with
californian
horsemen
a
portion
of
whom
dashed
at
full
speed
past
the
americans
to
occupy
a
hill
which
commanded
the
route
of
the
latter
while
the
remainder
of
the
party
threatened
the
rear
of
the
column
thirty
or
forty
of
the
enemy
quickly
occupied
the
hill
referred
to
and
as
the
column
came
up
six
or
eight
americans
filed
off
to
the
left
and
under
lieutenant
emory
charged
up
the
hill
when
the
californians
delivered
their
fire
and
fled
five
of
their
number
having
been
killed
or
wounded
by
the
rifles
of
the
assailants
the
wounded
having
been
removed
with
great
difficulty
the
cattle
having
been
lost
and
the
danger
of
losing
the
sick
and
the
packs
being
great
the
general
determined
to
halt
at
that
place
and
await
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
for
which
messengers
had
been
sent
to
san
diego
on
the
morning
of
the
accordingly
the
americans
occupied
the
high
ground
on
which
the
action
had
been
fought
bored
holes
for
water
killed
their
fattest
mules
for
meat
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
their
friends
until
the
morning
of
the
when
they
were
joined
by
one
hundred
seamen
and
eighty
marines
under
lieutenant
gray
who
had
been
sent
out
to
meet
them
by
commodore
stockton
and
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
combined
parties
entered
the
town
in
safety
at
this
time
commenced
that
memorable
conflict
between
the
two
commanders
general
kearney
and
commodore
stockton
respecting
the
chief
command
which
subsequently
created
so
much
trouble
in
the
american
ranks
and
throughout
the
country
commodore
stockton
appears
however
to
have
retained
the
authority
and
having
organized
a
force
sufficiently
strong
to
warrant
the
undertaking
and
general
kearney
having
accepted
an
invitation
to
accompany
the
expedition
on
december
he
marched
from
san
diego
with
two
officers
and
privates
dragoons
two
officers
and
seamen
acting
as
artillerymen
eighteen
officers
and
three
hundred
seamen
and
marines
acting
as
infantry
six
officers
and
privates
volunteers
and
six
pieces
of
artillery
against
the
main
body
of
the
insurgents
near
los
angeles
the
command
appears
to
have
been
given
at
his
own
request
to
general
kearney
and
as
the
wagon
train
was
heavily
laden
the
progress
of
the
column
was
very
slow
the
expedition
reaching
the
rio
san
gabriel
on
january
although
the
enemy
had
offered
no
opposition
to
its
progress
even
in
passes
where
a
small
force
could
have
effectively
kept
it
back
at
this
place
however
he
had
made
a
stand
to
dispute
the
passage
of
the
river
and
here
the
second
action
was
fought
between
the
americans
and
the
californians
the
rio
san
gabriel
at
the
spot
where
this
action
was
fought
is
about
one
hundred
yards
wide
the
current
about
flowing
over
a
quicksand
bottom
the
left
bank
by
which
the
americans
approached
is
level
that
on
the
right
is
also
level
for
a
short
distance
back
but
beyond
this
narrow
plain
a
bank
fifty
feet
in
height
commands
the
ford
and
the
intervening
flat
while
both
banks
are
fringed
with
a
thick
undergrowth
on
this
bank
directly
in
front
of
the
ford
four
pieces
of
artillery
were
posted
supported
on
either
flank
by
strong
bodies
of
cavalry
while
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
and
the
flat
in
front
were
posted
the
sharpshooters
against
this
position
the
american
column
moved
the
second
division
in
front
with
the
first
and
third
divisions
on
the
right
and
left
flanks
the
cattle
and
the
wagon
train
moved
next
the
volunteer
riflemen
and
the
fourth
division
brought
up
the
rear
as
the
head
of
the
column
approached
the
bank
of
the
river
the
enemy
sharpshooters
opened
a
scattering
fire
and
the
second
division
was
ordered
to
deploy
as
skirmishers
cross
the
river
and
drive
the
former
from
the
thicket
while
the
first
and
third
divisions
covered
the
flanks
of
the
train
and
with
it
followed
in
the
rear
when
this
line
of
skirmishers
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
was
pressing
forward
toward
the
opposite
bank
the
enemy
brought
his
artillery
to
bear
and
made
the
water
fly
with
grape
and
round
shot
and
the
american
fieldpieces
were
immediately
dragged
across
the
river
and
placed
in
on
the
right
bank
in
opposition
to
those
of
the
enemy
the
fire
of
the
americans
appears
to
have
caused
considerable
confusion
in
the
ranks
of
the
insurgents
and
under
its
cover
the
wagon
train
and
cattle
with
their
guard
passed
the
river
during
which
time
the
enemy
attacked
its
rear
and
was
repelled
having
safely
crossed
the
river
the
american
column
appears
to
have
deployed
under
cover
of
the
high
ground
the
californian
grape
and
round
shot
rattling
over
the
heads
of
the
men
and
the
enemy
immediately
charged
on
both
its
flanks
simultaneously
dashing
down
the
slope
with
great
spirit
with
great
coolness
the
second
division
was
thrown
into
squares
and
after
a
round
or
two
drove
off
the
enemy
from
the
left
flank
the
first
division
received
a
similar
order
but
as
the
assailants
on
the
right
hesitated
and
did
not
come
down
as
far
as
their
associates
on
the
opposite
flank
the
order
was
countermanded
and
the
division
was
ordered
to
charge
up
the
hill
where
the
enemy
main
body
was
supposed
to
be
posted
with
great
coolness
this
movement
was
executed
and
the
heights
were
gained
but
there
was
no
enemy
in
sight
he
had
abandoned
his
position
and
although
he
pitched
his
camp
on
the
hills
in
view
of
the
americans
when
morning
came
he
had
moved
still
farther
back
the
strength
of
the
americans
in
this
action
the
action
of
the
rio
san
gabriel
had
been
shown
already
that
of
the
californians
was
about
six
hundred
with
four
pieces
of
artillery
the
loss
of
the
former
was
one
man
killed
and
nine
men
wounded
that
of
the
enemy
is
not
known
on
the
following
morning
january
the
american
column
resumed
its
march
over
the
mesa
a
wide
plain
which
extends
from
the
rio
san
gabriel
to
the
rio
san
fernando
surrounded
by
reconnoitring
parties
from
the
enemy
and
when
about
four
miles
from
los
angeles
the
enemy
was
discovered
on
the
right
of
the
line
of
march
awaiting
its
approach
when
the
column
had
come
abreast
of
the
enemy
the
latter
opened
fire
from
his
artillery
on
its
right
flank
and
soon
afterward
deployed
his
force
making
a
horseshoe
in
front
of
the
american
column
and
opening
with
two
pieces
of
artillery
on
its
front
while
two
continued
their
fire
on
the
right
after
stopping
about
fifteen
minutes
to
silence
the
the
column
again
moved
forward
when
by
a
movement
similar
to
that
employed
on
the
rio
san
gabriel
the
day
before
two
charges
were
made
simultaneously
on
its
left
flank
and
on
its
right
and
rear
contrary
to
the
positive
instructions
of
the
officers
in
the
former
of
these
charges
the
enemy
was
met
with
a
fire
at
long
distance
yet
although
he
had
not
come
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
column
several
of
his
men
were
knocked
out
of
their
saddles
and
a
round
of
grape
which
was
immediately
sent
after
him
completely
scattered
his
right
wing
the
charge
on
the
right
and
the
rear
of
the
column
fared
little
better
and
the
entire
force
of
the
insurgents
was
withdrawn
the
strength
of
both
parties
was
probably
as
on
the
preceding
day
at
the
rio
san
gabriel
the
loss
of
the
californians
is
not
known
that
of
the
americans
was
captain
gillespie
lieutenant
rowan
and
three
men
wounded
the
troops
encamped
near
the
field
of
battle
and
on
the
following
morning
january
the
enemy
surrendered
when
the
city
of
los
angeles
was
occupied
by
the
americans
without
further
opposition
this
was
the
last
exertion
made
by
the
sons
of
california
for
the
liberty
and
independence
of
their
country
say
the
mexican
historians
and
its
defence
will
always
do
them
honor
since
without
supplies
without
means
or
instructions
they
rushed
into
an
unequal
contest
in
which
they
more
than
once
taught
the
invaders
what
a
people
can
do
who
fight
in
defence
of
their
rights
the
city
of
los
angeles
was
occupied
by
the
american
forces
on
january
and
the
loss
of
that
rich
vast
and
precious
part
of
the
mexican
territory
was
consummated
the
fall
of
edgar
sanderson
this
great
mahometan
was
an
arab
chief
whose
heroic
conduct
as
leader
of
the
arabs
in
their
wars
against
the
french
in
algeria
gave
him
a
place
among
the
eminent
and
statesmen
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
marshal
soult
declared
that
was
one
of
the
three
great
men
then
living
the
two
others
also
being
mahometans
the
final
course
and
fall
of
this
man
whose
name
means
servant
of
the
mighty
god
is
itself
an
important
concern
of
history
without
regard
to
its
effect
upon
the
relations
of
empire
after
the
french
provoked
by
the
conduct
of
hasan
dey
of
algeria
had
occupied
algiers
his
capital
in
a
new
government
was
set
up
in
france
louis
philippe
ascending
the
throne
in
place
of
the
expelled
charles
x
at
the
time
of
this
revolution
in
france
the
soldiers
of
charles
had
already
overrun
a
great
part
of
algeria
but
they
had
not
subdued
the
country
and
their
absolute
dominion
extended
only
a
little
beyond
the
capital
itself
the
french
commander
fortified
his
territory
but
had
to
recruit
his
garrisons
from
among
the
natives
in
raised
the
standard
of
the
prophet
the
arabs
rallied
to
his
call
and
for
several
years
he
carried
on
a
stubborn
war
against
the
french
whom
in
he
signally
defeated
in
the
arab
leader
now
sultan
again
fought
the
invaders
in
several
severe
engagements
on
the
tafna
river
in
these
affairs
the
advantage
lay
with
the
arab
in
june
general
bugeaud
was
sent
to
command
the
french
forces
and
he
proved
to
be
the
strongest
opponent
that
had
met
there
was
more
fighting
on
the
tafna
it
was
indecisive
and
in
may
a
treaty
known
as
the
treaty
of
the
tafna
was
concluded
general
bugeaud
having
received
instructions
either
to
make
peace
with
or
to
subdue
him
the
story
of
the
arab
hero
from
this
point
in
his
career
is
told
by
sanderson
the
faithful
commemorator
of
great
patriots
a
high
authority
on
modern
africa
the
famous
treaty
of
the
tafna
concluded
between
and
bugeaud
was
a
triumph
for
the
arab
sultan
with
the
consent
of
all
the
great
sheiks
the
leaders
of
cavalry
contingents
the
venerable
marabouts
and
the
most
distinguished
warriors
of
the
province
of
oran
the
sultan
not
acknowledging
the
sovereignty
of
france
but
ceding
to
her
a
limited
portion
of
the
provinces
of
oran
and
algiers
reserved
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
for
all
arabs
dwelling
on
french
territory
he
undertook
to
supply
the
french
army
with
a
large
quantity
of
corn
and
oxen
and
to
confine
the
commerce
of
the
regency
to
french
ports
in
return
he
received
the
administration
of
the
larger
part
of
the
provinces
of
oran
and
algiers
and
the
whole
of
tittery
the
important
right
of
buying
powder
sulphur
and
weapons
in
france
and
freedom
of
trade
between
the
arabs
and
the
french
in
ceding
the
province
of
tittery
bugeaud
had
violated
the
strict
orders
of
the
french
government
alleging
in
excuse
to
the
minister
of
war
that
any
other
arrangement
was
impossible
the
treaty
in
fact
confined
the
french
to
a
few
towns
on
the
seacoast
with
small
adjacent
territories
all
the
fortresses
and
strongholds
in
the
interior
were
left
in
the
hands
of
he
was
the
possessor
of
of
algeria
and
he
appeared
before
the
world
as
the
friend
and
ally
of
france
the
treaty
was
held
by
the
french
government
to
be
a
high
stroke
of
policy
converting
an
enemy
into
an
ally
the
french
people
regarded
it
as
a
humiliating
surrender
of
french
territory
to
a
rival
power
it
was
the
culminating
point
of
career
during
the
year
the
sultan
was
engaged
in
the
work
of
a
statesman
legislator
administrator
and
reformer
displaying
wonderful
activity
enterprise
vigor
and
intellectual
power
as
the
founder
of
an
empire
which
for
the
happiness
of
algeria
was
to
be
too
after
the
tafna
treaty
he
had
received
a
magnificent
present
of
arms
from
louis
philippe
king
of
the
french
and
as
a
man
who
had
subdued
either
by
arms
or
by
persuasive
eloquence
the
hardy
kabyles
he
stood
high
in
the
estimation
of
his
moslem
in
morocco
and
egypt
tripoli
and
tunis
and
of
the
or
bodies
of
learned
doctors
in
divinity
and
law
at
alexandria
and
mecca
who
watched
with
joy
and
with
ardent
expectation
of
yet
higher
things
the
career
of
one
who
seemed
destined
to
revive
the
pristine
glories
of
islam
the
great
sultan
in
order
to
consolidate
his
power
both
against
the
french
and
over
the
arabs
constructed
a
number
of

tekedemt
an
old
roman
town
about
sixty
miles
southeast
of
oran
was
designed
to
be
the
capital
as
a
great
centre
of
commerce
between
the
tell
and
the
sahara
the
first
stone
of
the
new
city

had
been
laid
by
the
sultan
in
may
and
as
the
place
grew
a
population
of
settlers
from
mascara
mostaganem
and
other
towns
poured
in
large
stores
of
warlike
munitions

formed
and
a
factory
worked
by

from
paris
on
liberal
wages
turned
out
eight
new
muskets
a
day
a
mint
of
silver
and
copper
coins
was
established
the
defences
carried
twelve
cannon
and
six
mortars
a
french
observer
who
was
a
prisoner
at
the
time
when
the
sultan
was
personally
directing
the
works
at
tekedemt
describes
his
simple
costume
like
that
of
a
laborer
his
large
tall
hat
plaited
with
his
incomparable
grace
and
fascinating
smile
as
he
saluted
the
man
who
was
rather
a
guest
than
a
captive
the
reforms
of
included
a
regular
police
schools
and
local
tribunals
of
justice
all
the
chief
towns
had
factories
conducted
by
europeans
working
in
brass
and
iron
cotton
and
wool
the
army
contained
the
finest
irregular
cavalry
in
the
world
amounting
with
all
the
contingents
from
the
tribes
to
about
sixty
thousand
men
only
a
third
of
whom
however
were
ever
assembled
for
any
single
military
operation
his
regular
force
comprised
eight
thousand
infantry
two
thousand
cavalry
twenty
and
two
hundred
forty
artillerymen
his
great
ideal
embraced
the
making
the
arabs
into
one
nation
the
recall
of
the
whole
people
to
a
strict
observance
of
religious
duties
the
inspiring
them
with
true
patriotism
the
calling
forth
of
all
their
capabilities
for
war
for
commerce
for
agriculture
and
for
mental
improvement
and
the
crowning
of
the
whole
by
the
impress
of
european
civilization
in
laying
the
foundation
for
this
mighty
work
he
had
already
overcome
vast
difficulties
by
means
of
wonderful
enterprise
activity
and
vigor
his
intellectual
greatness
had
caused
him
to
shine
as
a
warrior
diplomatist
orator
and
statesman
the
provinces
of
oran
and
tittery
and
the
plains
of
the
northern
sahara
had
been
won
by
his
military
prowess
a
still
nobler
triumph
in
the
exhibition
of
moral
power
was
beheld
in
his
dealings
with
the
region
called
great
kabylia
the
superb
range
of
the
djurjura
mountains
extending
eastward
from
algiers
the
hardy
kabyles
of
that
territory
had
remained
unsubdued
amid
the
changing
governments
which
had
risen
and
fallen
around
them
as
independent
little
republics
bound
together
by
the
most
exalted
spirit
of
freedom
they
had
ever
preserved
their
usages
customs
and
laws
in
september
attended
by
only
fifty
horsemen
suddenly
appeared
among
them
thousands
gathered
around
his
tent
from
the
valleys
and
fastnesses
he
addressed
them
in
a
stirring
and
argumentative
harangue
pointing
out
union
under
his
standard
as
the
only
safeguard
against
french
conquest
with
loud
shouts
they
accepted
his
faithful
caliph
ben
salem
as
their
chief
in
war
and
agreed
to
pay
the
regular
imposts
and
to
go
forth
to
the
djehad
for
thirty
days
the
sultan
made
a
progress
through
the
country
everywhere
received
with
joy
and
enthusiasm
as
a
venerated
and
marabout
as
a
teacher
of
the
law
as
a
man
of
pious
life
as
a
renowned
warrior
and
an
eloquent
preacher
we
can
not
dwell
here
on
his
educational
and
moral
reforms
his
earnest
efforts
to
enforce
the
teaching
of
the
which
was
his
guide
in
his
public
and
private
life
his
beneficent
intentions
were
all
to
be
frustrated
by
the
ambition
of
a
european
nation
which
was
to
signally
fail
not
in
the
work
of
conquering
but
in
turning
her
conquest
to
good
account
hastily
drawn
treaties
are
a
prolific
source
of
war
the
treaty
of
the
tafna
was
a
flagrant
example
of
this
class
of
diplomatic
documents
there
were
two
drafts
one
in
arabic
with
the
sultan
seal
the
other
in
french
with
bugeaud
the
drafts
were
not
carefully
compared
the
limits
of
territory
assigned
to
each
of
the
parties
were
not
made
clear
one
instance
of
the
lack
of
identity
in
the
two
forms
of
the
instrument
will
suffice
the
french
form
declared
that
acknowledged
the
sovereignty
of
france
the
sultan
had
never
dreamed
of
making
an
admission
which
in
its
effect
on
the
tribes
would
have
cost
him
his
throne
what
he
had
written
in
arabic
in
the
article
which
he
subscribed
was
properly
translated
the
emir
acknowledges
that
there
is
a
french
sultan
and
that
he
is
great
a
new
marshal
valée
had
assumed
his
functions
at
algiers
in
november
disputes
arose
as
to
the
territorial
rights
of
the
sultan
under
the
tafna
treaty
and
after
vain
negotiations
and
missions
to
and
fro
matters
were
brought
to
a
head
by
marshal
valée
in
the
despatch
of
an
expedition
to
march
over
some
disputed
ground
as
a
demonstration
of
french
power
and
an
assertion
of
french
rights
a
column
under
the
duc
started
from
milah
in
the
province
of
constantine
lately
conquered
by
the
french
to
march
across
the
disputed
territory
and
thence
onward
a
way
was
gained
through
a
formidable
pass
called
the
iron
gates
in
october
by
a
simple
process
the
defile
was
one
which
a
few
hundred
men
could
have
held
against
any
force
but
the
kabyle
sheiks
were
shown
passports
bearing
seal
and
authorizing
the
passage
of
french
troops
the
seal
of
the
sultan
had
been
forged
on
november
valée
and
the
french
prince
made
a
triumphant
entry
into
algiers
after
this
despicable
piece
of
treachery
and
were
saluted
as
the
heroes
of
the
iron
gates
the
news
reached
at
tekedemt
he
sprang
on
his
horse
and
in
hours
riding
night
and
day
was
at
medea
whence
he
despatched
a
reproachful
and
defiant
letter
to
the
french
governor
he
called
the
tribesmen
to
arms
formally
declared
war
swept
down
on
the
plains
destroyed
the
french
cantonments
agricultural
establishments
and
outposts
slew
many
colonists
burned
the
villages
and
drove
fugitives
headlong
into
the
city
of
algiers
the
french
government
then
ostentatiously
declared
the
adoption
of
a
firm
policy
and
announced
algeria
to
be
henceforth
and
forever
a
french
province
reënforcements
were
rapidly
sent
to
algiers
and
the
effective
army
of
valée
was
soon
raised
to
thirty
thousand
men
the
sultan
headed
about
the
same
number
of
cavalry
regular
and
irregular
and
six
thousand
regular
infantry
a
fair
trial
of
strength
frenchman
against
arab
was
now
to
be
made
concentrating
his
army
at
blidah
at
the
foot
of
the
lesser
atlas
range
the
french
marshal
marched
on
medea
and
millana
the
river
chiffa
was
passed
on
april
the
sultan
cavalry
appeared
in
large
numbers
by
a
feigned
movement
induced
his
enemy
to
enter
the
mountains
by
the
gorges
of
the
monzaia
which
he
had
spent
months
in
fortifying
every
eminence
useful
for
the
purpose
was
cut
into
intrenchments
a
redoubt
with
heavy
batteries
crowned
the
highest
peak
near
this
were
placed
his
regular
infantry
officered
by
french
deserters
arabs
and
kabyles
swarmed
in
all
directions
and
crouching
in
nooks
were
ready
to
open
fire
on
the
french
army
as
it
wound
its
way
with
steady
march
along
the
narrow
causeway
which
hung
midway
on
the
mountain
slopes
valée
had
divided
his
force
into
three
columns
one
of
which
was
led
by
lamoricière
a
man
to
become
famous
in
algerian
warfare
the
sultan
was
now
to
see
the
value
of
french
infantry
to
the
astonishment
of
the
arabs
the
enemy
leaving
the
road
came
darting
over
the
steeps
ravines
woods
and
rocks
were
all
mastered
in
the
rush
slowly
but
surely
they
were
reaching
the
intrenchments
when
a
thick
veil
came
over
the
scene
from
the
smoke
of
incessant
fire
the
mist
rolled
away
before
the
breeze
sweeping
through
the
pass
and
the
combatants
met
and
fought
hand
to
hand
the
arabs
and
kabyles
clung
desperately
to
their
places
of
shelter
but
the
french
clambered
up
grasping
at
shrubs
and
branches
ever
winning
their
way
made
a
last
stand
in
person
at
the
great
redoubt
while
his
regulars
and
masses
of
kabyles
gathered
round
him
the
converging
columns
of
the
french
came
creeping
on
amid
the
roll
of
drums
and
the
blare
of
trumpets
the
arabs
bewildered
by
foes
attacking
them
both
in
front
and
rear

the
sultan
had
made
his
last
attempt
to
fight
the
french
on
the
principles
of
european
warfare
his
caliphs
and
chiefs
were
ordered
never
again
to
meet
the
enemy
in
masses
but
to
harass
them
in
hanging
on
their
flanks
and
rear
cutting
their
communications
attacking
baggage
and
transports
and
waging
a
contest
of
feigned
retreats
ambuscades
and
sudden
sallies
in
order
to
bewilder
and
weary
the
foe
miliana
was
evacuated
by
on
approach
but
the
chance
of
arab
warfare
came
when
the
french
entered
the
mountain
passes
unceasing
attacks
day
and
night
caused
severe
loss
to
the
lately
victorious
french
with
the
capture
of
baggage
and
the
abandonment
of
all
wounded
men
the
french
garrisons
in
medea
and
miliana
were
soon
reduced
to
want
by
blockade
of
the
surrounding
country
and
by
october
the
garrison
of
miliana
had
almost
disappeared
from
the
effects
of
fever
and
famine
out
of
fifteen
hundred
men
the
half
had
perished
five
hundred
were
in
hospital
and
the
remainder
were
haggard
wretches
who
could
hardly
hold
their
muskets
such
was
the
warfare
in
the
mountains
of
the
province
of
tittery
and
by
his
swift
movements
kept
the
enemy
ever
on
the
alert
and
often
in
trouble
from
the
frontiers
of
morocco
to
those
of
tunis
the
real
and
decisive
struggle
began
early
in
the
right
man
was
at
last
found
by
the
french
to
deal
with
the
hitherto
indomitable
sultan
of
tittery
and
oran
the
government
at
paris
had
begun
in
some
sort
to
understand
the
power
of
their
formidable
adversary
and
a
serious
effort
was
to
be
made
on
february
general
bugeaud
assumed
office
as
of
algeria
he
had
now
come
not
in
the
mood
and
with
the
policy
of
the
day
when
he
concluded
the
treaty
of
the
tafna
but
as
one
whose
task
it
was
to
crush
every
rival
power
in
algeria
for
this
end
thousand
men
were
placed
under
his
command
thomas
bugeaud
was
a
man
of
great
ability
and
he
has
the
credit
of
devising
the
only
method
by
which
such
an
antagonist
as
in
such
a
country
could
be
subdued
against
an
adversary
so
mobile
so
full
of
expedients
and
resource
mobility
and
incessantly
offensive
movements
offered
the
only
chance
of
success
the
french
commander
knew
that
it
was
no
mere
army
but
a
people
in
arms
that
he
was
to
encounter
his
forces
were
at
once
organized
in
many
small
compact
columns
each
composed
of
a
few
infantry
battalions
and
two
squadrons
of
horse
with
a
little
transport
train
of
mules
and
camels
and
two
mountain
howitzers
picked
men
alone
acclimatized
and
used
to
toil
were
employed
and
they
carried
nothing
but
their
muskets
and
ammunition
with
a
little
food
these
columns
were
placed
under
the
command
of
such
energetic
leaders
as
changarnier
and
cavaignac
canrobert
and
pélissier
bedeau
and
lamoricière
arnaud
and
the
duc
the
campaign
opened
with
the
revictualling
of
medea
and
miliana
with
great
losses
to
the
french
as
disputed
every
inch
of
the
ground
bugeaud
personally
operating
in
oran
reached
tekedemt
on
may
and
found
it
deserted
and
in
flames
boghar
saida
and
other
fortresses
were
successively
destroyed
the
enemies
of
the
sultan
were
paying
a
heavy
price
for
success
at
the
end
of
bugeaud
out
of
sixty
thousand
men
in
the
field
had
only
four
thousand
fit
for
duty
the
rest
had
perished
or
were
invalided
for
the
time
from
the
toil
of
marches
incessant
fighting
and
the
heat
of
the
climate
the
french
government
proposals
of
peace
on
certain
terms
only
confirmed
in
his
resolve
to
try
the
extremities
of
war
bugeaud
main
object
was
to
establish
permanent
centres
of
action
in
the
very
heart
of
the
arab
confederation
of
tribes
and
by
rapidly
consecutive
expeditions
radiating
from
these
centres
to
give
his
troops
the
ubiquity
of
forces
the
chief
seat
of
the
power
was
the
province
of
oran
and
this
was
made
the
principal
scene
of
operations
mascara
was
held
by
lamoricière
tlemsen
by
bedeau
changarnier
was
in
observation
on
the
western
frontier
of
the
plain
of
algiers
tittery
was
menaced
by
from
oran
and
mostaganem
three
columns
were
sent
forth
against
the
tribes
occupying
the
large
expanse
of
territory
lying
between
the
atlas
mountains
and
the
mediterranean
and
the
tribes
extending
toward
the
sahara
the
first
force
headed
by
bugeaud
in
person
marched
along
the
valley
of
the
chéliff
and
then
joined
the
second
column
under
changarnier
coming
from
blida
the
third
body
under
lamoricière
aimed
at
pushing
back
to
the
south
in
order
to
separate
him
from
the
tribes
assailed
by
changarnier
and
bugeaud
the
plan
of
campaign
was
formidable
for
the
arabs
but
it
was
encountered
by
the
sultan
with
wonderful
skill
and
daring
in
a
struggle
which
involved
some
thrilling
episodes
lamoricière
in
his
efforts
to
overtake
the
foe
was
constantly
baffled
hearing
that
was
before
mascara
he
hurried
thither
by
forced
marches
only
to
find
that
his
enemy
had
passed
by
his
rear
and
was
raiding
a
tribe
friendly
to
the
french
pursuing
in
the
new
direction
the
french
leader
was
outmaneuvre
by
the
sultan
bold
and
rapid
dash
across
the
chéliff
placing
his
arabs
between
bugeaud
and
the
sea
and
recovering
his
ascendency
over
the
tribes
in
that
region
then
swept
in
a
to
the
south
of
miliana
and
soon
appeared
in
full
force
in
the
sahara
as
the
bewildered
french
pursuers
returned
to
their
cantonments
in
despair
of
reaching
him
this
is
a
sample
of
the
evolutions
by
which
genius
made
amends
for
inferiority
of
force
the
ablest
military
combinations
were
rendered
abortive
by
an
enemy
that
was
ever
slipping
between
columns
flitting
in
the
front
hovering
on
the
flanks
assailing
the
rear
and
with
perfect
knowledge
of
the
country
was
sometimes
in
the
mountains
and
again
in
the
plains
ubiquitous
unattainable
for
serious
conflict
leaving
his
caliphs
to
maintain
this
exasperating
species
of
warfare
in
the
province
of
oran
made
for
the
frontiers
of
morocco
there
many
tribes
had
submitted
under
the
influence
of
bedeau
military
and
diplomatic
skill
the
sultan
communications
with
the
country
whence
he
drew
his
weapons
clothing
and
ammunition
were
seriously
threatened
his
appearance
at
once
brought
back
the
kabyles
of
nedrouma
to
their
allegiance
and
their
example
was
followed
by
other
tribes
with
the
result
that
his
army
was
increased
to
the
number
of
three
thousand
cavalry
and
five
thousand
infantry
able
now
to
confront
the
enemy
during
the
months
of
march
and
april
had
frequent
encounters
with
bedeau
the
issue
was
yet
indecisive
when
the
sultan
was
called
away
to
mascara
to
deal
with
lamoricière
who
had
been
gaining
ground
and
winning
over
tribes
including
even
a
large
part
of
own
people
the
hashems
lamoricière
believing
the
sultan
to
be
still
engaged
with
bedeau
had
marched
toward
the
sahara
and
by
a
mingling
of
severe
punishment
and
mild
treatment
regained
most
of
his
old
authority
lamoricière
on
receiving
the
news
of
his
presence
hastened
back
to
find
his
recent
work
undone
and
to
be
assailed
by
the
tribes
who
had
so
lately
joined
him
fighting
his
way
bravely
on
to
an
encounter
with
the
great
leader
of
the
arabs
the
french
general
heard
of
him
as
in
force
at
tekedemt
when
he
reached
that
place
he
found
that
had
fallen
on
changarnier
toward
miliana
that
general
knowing
nothing
of
the
sultan
approach
found
himself
enveloped
by
a
vast
force
of
arabs
and
kabyles
regulars
and
irregulars
horse
and
foot
led
on
by
in
person
and
charging
furiously
on
all
sides
after
two
days
and
nights
of
incessant
battle
in
which
men
closed
fiercely
with
pistols
swords
bayonets
and
yataghans
the
sultan
vanished
with
his
force
leaving
the
french
too
exhausted
and
crippled
by
their
losses
for
pursuit
two
days
later
tidings
reached
them
that
he
was
in
the
metidja
ravaging
the
plain
and
carrying
terror
to
the
very
gates
of
algiers
then
bore
away
to
the
atlas
ascended
the
mountains
penetrated
beyond
tittery
and
reached
the
sahara
everywhere
inspiriting
the
tribes
and
raising
fresh
forces
after
sweeping
over
three
hundred
leagues
of
ground
he
returned
in
recruited
strength
and
new
energy
to
press
upon
lamoricière
and
his
garrison
at
mascara
with
all
the
rigors
of
a
winter
blockade
in
spite
of
his
wonderful
efforts
the
sultan
could
not
but
feel
that
he
was
struggling
with
adverse
fortune
the
enemy
by
the
seizure
of
his
fixed
establishments
had
gained
possession
of
a
large
part
of
his
territory
and
of
the
strongholds
that
had
contained
his
stores
of
war
his
regular
army
had
almost
disappeared
and
much
of
his
credit
among
the
arabs
had
departed
the
which
was
his
ancestral
abode
had
been
laid
waste
he
could
not
protect
the
families
of
his
most
faithful
adherents
from
constant
exposure
in
spite
of
his
vigilant
activity
to
the
outrages
of
the
detested
infidels
in
this
position
he
resolved
to
remove
from
the
scene
of
warfare
those
whom
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
desert
with
any
regard
to
feelings
of
religion
and
humanity
he
formed
his
famous
a
new
and
remarkable
organization
consisting
of
a
gathering
of
private
families
to
this
moving
asylum
of
refuge
and
safety
the
arab
tribes
sent
their
treasure
their
herds
their
women
and
children
their
sick
and
aged
persons
the
smala
was
a
great
travelling
capital
containing
at
first
more
than
twenty
thousand
souls
following
the
sultan
movements
sometimes
in
advance
to
the
more
cultivated
regions
or
in
retreat
to
the
sahara
according
to
the
fluctuations
of
the
contest
which
he
was
so
bravely
waging
in
the
sahara
the
tents
of
the
smala
spread
to
the
distant
horizon
in
the
tell
they
filled
the
valley
and
rose
up
the
slopes
of
the
hills
all
the
arrangements
were
of
military
regularity
the
different
or
households
with
tents
varying
in
number
with
their
dwellers
were
distributed
into
four
great
encampments
each
deira
knew
its
appointed
place
each
chief
had
his
station
marked
and
his
special
duties
assigned
four
tribes
were
set
apart
to
protect
and
guide
the
smala
in
its
wanderings
and
the
guard
was
composed
of
regular
troops
the
existence
of
this
organization
ever
growing
in
extent
became
a
powerful
check
on
the
disaffection
of
the
tribes
when
the
french
leaders
tempted
them
with
fair
promises
the
warriors
bethought
them
of
the
pledges
the
women
the
children
the
flocks
and
herds
which
were
in
the
sultan
hands
the
genius
of
had
created
a
new
and
widely
extended
political
engine
when
the
french
leaders
had
learned
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
the
smala
its
capture
or
dispersal
became
a
chief
object
with
all
officers
from
the
generals
of
corps
to
the
colonels
in
charge
of
detachments
the
campaign
of
was
opened
by
lamoricière
who
occupied
tekedemt
with
about
fifteen
hundred
horsemen
watched
his
movements
from
some
neighboring
woods
he
knew
that
the
french
commander
object
was
the
smala
and
he
remained
in
ambush
for
twenty
days
he
and
his
men
lived
on
acorns
the
horses
were
fed
on
leaves
one
day
a
stray
sheep
was
found
the
sultan
would
have
none
of
it
and
said
take
it
to
my
starving
soldiers
as
he
turned
to
his
meal
of
acorns
twice
was
lamoricière
repulsed
in
his
search
and
then
a
traitor
revealed
the
exact
place
of
the
smala
encampment
lamoricière
remained
to
occupy
the
attention
of
and
the
french
column
stationed
at
medea
was
selected
for
the
attack
the
leadership
was
intrusted
to
the
duc
and
on
may
he
started
from
boghar
with
thirteen
hundred
infantry
six
hundred
horse
and
two
the
indicated
place
of
encampment
was
found
empty
and
the
french
column
wandered
about
in
uncertain
fashion
at
break
of
day
on
may
the
traitor
made
known
the
new
spot
of
the
smala
halt
and
at
once
daringly
advanced
with
his
cavalry
alone
the
surprise
created
a
panic
among
the
people
the
guard
of
five
hundred
regulars
fired
a
volley
and
fled
a
handful
of
the
hashem
tribe
bravely
strove
to
stem
the
torrent
but
they
were
swept
away
in
the
rout
and
in
an
hour
all
was
over
the
smala
was
broken
up
amid
scenes
of
terrible
confusion
and
despair
including
the
extraordinary
sight
of
a
promiscuous
mass
of
camels
dromedaries
horses
mules
oxen
and
sheep
careering
and
plunging
on
the
plain
there
was
little
bloodshed
but
the
french
victors
were
in
possession
of
hostages
of
the
utmost
value
in
the
families
of
most
influential
chiefs
his
own
family
had
escaped
the
booty
taken
was
immense
comprising
thousands
of
animals
the
sultan
valuable
library
of
rare
arabic
manuscripts
the
military
chest
containing
some
millions
of
francs
and
the
chests
of
his
caliphs
and
other
high
officers
filled
with
gold
and
silver
coins
and
costly
jewellery
the
french
soldiers
baled
out
dollars
and
doubloons
in
their
shakos
and
helped
themselves
to
diamonds
and
pearls
this
dreadful
blow
when
the
news
reached
him
in
the
woods
where
he
watched
near
lamoricière
command
almost
overwhelmed
for
a
time
even
the
exalted
and
undaunted
spirit
of
the
sultan
he
spent
some
hours
alone
in
his
tent
in
meditation
and
prayer
he
came
forth
with
a
smile
and
addressed
his
chiefs
his
officers
and
men
as
they
stood
outside
in
groups
some
downcast
and
silent
some
bitterly
cursing
their
foe
and
fate
he
reminded
them
that
the
dear
objects
now
lost
had
impeded
the
movements
of
the
holy
war
against
the
infidels
and
that
those
who
had
fallen
were
now
in
paradise
the
next
day
he
wrote
to
his
caliphs
bidding
them
not
to
be
discouraged
they
would
thenceforth
be
lighter
and
in
better
order
for
war
in
fact
at
the
time
of
the
duc
attack
the
population
of
the
smala
amounted
to
not
less
than
sixty
thousand
not
more
than
three
thousand
prisoners
were
taken
the
rest
of
the
arabs
were
dispersed
in
all
directions
some
fell
among
arab
tribes
who
plundered
them
others
were
overtaken
by
lamoricière
the
blow
was
on
the
whole
irreparable
in
its
effects
upon
the
influence
of
the
sultan
every
day
brought
tidings
of
the
defection
of
some
great
tribe
the
ranks
of
his
enemies
were
swelled
by
large
contingents
of
arabs
worse
things
were
in
store
for
the
brave
man
contending
with
his
ablest
caliphs
were
removed
by
captivity
or
death
in
action
the
distant
provinces
fell
a
prey
to
the
foe
the
province
of
oran
became
the
scene
of
a
desperate
struggle
with
a
chosen
and
devoted
band
of
five
thousand
men
made
his
presence
felt
at
all
points
now
he
fell
on
recreant
tribes
now
he
made
head
against
the
french
columns
ever
in
the
van
leading
on
the
charge
plunging
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
by
his
example
he
encouraged
and
inspired
his
followers
his
bravest
warriors
fell
around
him
his
horses
were
slain
under
him
his
burnoose
was
torn
with
bullets
but
still
he
fought
on
the
world
record
can
show
no
more
brilliant
instance
of
almost
superhuman
heroism
once
he
was
taken
unawares
on
september
he
was
encamped
near
sidi
yusuf
with
a
battalion
of
infantry
and
five
hundred
irregular
horse
a
spy
made
known
his
position
to
lamoricière
who
was
at
a
distance
of
six
leagues
the
french
general
at
once
led
out
in
person
the
second
chasseurs
a
night
march
covered
the
intervening
space
and
the
spot
was
reached
in
the
gray
of
dawn
the
sultan
was
aroused
from
sleep
by
cries
of
the
french
the
french
he
had
barely
time
to
mount
he
might
have
escaped
but
he
preferred
the
risk
of
death
to
the
double
stain
of
surprise
and
flight
his
infantry
seized
their
arms
and
fired
a
volley
his
cavalry
rallied
at
his
voice
then
as
the
smoke
slowly
rolled
away
he
dashed
into
the
french
chasseurs
dispersed
them
by
the
sudden
shock
and
after
a
few
minutes
hard
fighting
drew
off
his
whole
force
in
perfect
order
the
the
men
whose
four
thousand
sabres
had
waved
in
exultation
around
the
young
leader
of
the
djehad
the
men
whose
splendid
courage
had
opened
before
him
the
path
of
glory
and
of
empire
had
gone
over
to
the
french
resolved
to
attack
them
suddenly
descending
upon
them
he
swept
through
their
encampments
slew
numbers
and
carried
off
a
great
booty
a
french
battalion
stationed
among
them
vainly
strove
to
arrest
his
progress
an
arab
chief
one
of
his
old
followers
boldly
singled
him
out
rode
up
and
fired
at
him
the
ball
missed
and
shot
the
traitor
dead
with
his
pistol
the
sultan
knew
that
all
was
lost
unless
he
could
obtain
external
aid
the
smala
was
now
reduced
to
his
own
deira
a
bare
thousand
souls
wandering
about
in
miserable
fashion
after
another
desperate
engagement
with
lamoricière
during
which
the
arab
women
cheered
on
the
warriors
and
and
his
men
fighting
in
the
presence
of
their
wives
and
children
performed
new
prodigies
of
valor
he
succeeded
in
safely
establishing
the
noncombatants
on
the
territory
of
morocco
bugeaud
now
become
a
marshal
wrote
to
his
government
declaring
that
all
serious
warfare
was
finished
in
the
summer
of
the
violation
of
abderrahman
territory
by
french
troops
under
lamoricière
and
bedeau
led
to
some
warfare
in
which
the
moroccan
troops
were
twice
defeated
the
people
of
the
country
were
strongly
in
favor
of
and
when
their
sultan
after
a
french
bombardment
of
tangiers
and
mogador
made
a
treaty
with
france
by
which
the
algerian
hero
was
placed
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
throughout
the
empire
of
morocco
as
well
as
in
algeria
and
was
to
be
pursued
by
main
force
by
the
moroccans
on
their
own
territory
the
moorish
population
was
filled
with
resentment
letters
reached
from
fez
the
capital
dictated
and
signed
by
the
first
grandees
in
the
state
both
civil
and
military
and
from
the
commercial
classes
inviting
him
to
ascend
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
had
he
been
a
mere
adventurer
or
usurper
he
might
have
lived
henceforth
and
died
emperor
of
morocco
but
his
whole
soul
was
patriotically
bent
on
one
object
the
freedom
and
independence
of
algeria
he
disdained
to
wear
a
borrowed
crown
as
he
afterward
declared
his
religion
forbade
him
to
injure
a
sovereign
chosen
and
appointed
by
god
during
the
year
the
sultan
had
made
a
rapid
incursion
into
the
tell
everywhere
appealing
to
the
tribes
but
he
found
the
national
spirit
overawed
by
the
presence
of
french
detachments
in
all
directions
and
he
returned
to
his
deira
in
despondent
spirit
he
now
received
appeals
from
some
of
his
devoted
caliphs
to
undertake
a
fresh
campaign
especially
from
the
loyal
and
chivalrous
ben
salem
who
dwelt
in
the
gorges
of
the
djur
jura
mountains
to
him
replied
promising
to
come
as
soon
as
affairs
in
the
west
were
settled
months
passed
away
and
the
arab
tribes
who
had
submitted
began
to
feel
the
pressure
of
french
domination
and
to
resent
the
supercilious
conduct
of
french
officials
in
the
spring
of
their
former
sultan
reappeared
he
swept
down
into
the
valley
of
the
tafna
and
routed
and
cut
to
pieces
a
french
detachment
in
this
action
the
lower
part
of
his
right
ear
was
carried
away
by
a
the
only
wound
which
he
ever
received
another
detachment
of
six
hundred
men
laid
down
their
arms
without
firing
a
shot
some
stir
was
made
among
the
arabs
by
these
successes
and
the
french
commanders
took
alarm
lamoricière
cavaignac
and
bedeau
wrote
pressing
letters
for
reinforcements
and
urged
the
return
of
bugeaud
the
most
formidable
foe
of
reached
the
scene
of
action
in
october
bringing
fresh
forces
and
in
a
week
he
took
the
field
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
twenty
thousand
men
this
fact
is
the
highest
eulogy
that
can
be
accorded
to
the
military
prowess
of
a
man
who
so
long
defied
the
power
of
france
the
end
of
the
great
career
was
rapidly
coming
after
another
vain
appeal
to
the
moorish
ruler
even
felt
that
all
was
lost
a
french
writer
in
the
truly
declares
the
greatness
of
the
man
was
strikingly
displayed
in
the
very
hour
of
his
downfall
destitute
of
resources
surrounded
by
foes
at
open
enmity
with
the
emperor
of
morocco
wandering
like
a
hunted
lion
with
hardly
any
comrade
but
his
horse
no
shelter
except
his
tent
still
inspired
a
terror
which
forced
his
enemies
to
keep
a
great
army
on
foot
in
algeria
for
protection
against
possible
attacks
at
his
hand
in
his
deira
at
this
time
all
was
despondency
and
grief
his
own
brothers
had
abandoned
him
ben
salem
the
faithful
devoted
friend
and
follower
was
a
voluntary
prisoner
in
the
french
camp
whole
force
was
fewer
than
two
thousand
men
but
among
these
were
twelve
hundred
horsemen
the
flower
of
the
algerian
cavalry
most
of
them
had
been
his
inseparable
comrades
partakers
in
all
his
hardships
and
dangers
throughout
his
career
during
a
short
period
of
rest
he
summoned
them
daily
around
him
and
aroused
new
enthusiasm
among
the
bronzed
veterans
by
his
eloquent
words
on
december
the
deira
was
stationed
on
moorish
territory
at
agueddin
on
the
left
bank
of
the
melouia
it
comprised
in
all
about
five
thousand
souls
the
next
day
news
arrived
that
a
great
moorish
host
under
the
sultan
two
sons
was
only
three
hours
march
away
on
january
gathered
his
armed
force
marched
at
dead
of
night
and
fell
furiously
on
the
first
division
of
the
moors
and
arabs
the
slumbering
foe
awoke
to
see
the
thick
darkness
illumined
by
flashes
of
light
from
muskets
seized
with
panic
the
men
rushed
away
in
all
directions
abandoning
arms
tents
and
baggage
in
the
mean
time
and
his
men
swept
onward
and
attacked
the
second
division
which
was
also
defeated
and
dispersed
in
half
an
hour
the
third
division
was
reached
this
force
had
time
to
prepare
for
defence
and
the
assailants
withdrew
before
a
steady
fire
of
infantry
and
artillery
to
an
adjacent
hill
at
midday
five
thousand
moorish
cavalry
moved
out
against
little
army
at
charging
distance
he
led
on
his
men
swept
through
the
foe
and
by
a
skilful
combination
of
assault
and
retreat
regained
his
deira
by
the
river
melouia
before
sunset
the
deira
had
nearly
effected
its
passage
across
the
river
with
the
baggage
and
the
spoils
taken
from
the
enemy
when
the
moorish
army
was
seen
cautiously
advancing
the
situation
was
full
of
peril
the
deira
had
never
been
so
exposed
the
ammunition
was
expended
and
the
infantry
was
thus
counted
out
of
the
fight
could
only
depend
on
his
old
guard
his
matchless
cavalry
at
length
the
melouia
was
passed
and
although
the
foe
was
pressing
on
he
would
not
leave
its
bank
until
the
noncombatants
had
gained
a
full
hour
in
advance
then
the
deira
crossed
another
stream
and
reached
a
place
of
safety
for
the
time
on
french
territory
not
a
life
had
been
lost
nor
a
beast
of
burden
of
all
that
crowd
of
men
women
children
and
animals
coolness
intrepidity
and
skill
had
been
their
protectors
of
the
fighting
men
however
more
than
two
hundred
had
been
slain
and
nearly
all
the
rest
were
suffering
from
wounds
now
turned
toward
the
hills
inhabited
by
a
tribe
which
still
in
part
adhered
to
him
his
horsemen
followed
him
in
anxious
silence
suffering
and
exhausted
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
their
chief
was
tormented
by
conflicting
thoughts
a
french
camp
was
visible
in
the
distance
three
hours
march
away
occupying
a
pass
he
and
his
cavalry
might
yet
escape
by
narrow
defiles
into
the
sahara
but
what
of
his
aged
mother
his
wife
and
children
his
helpless
followers
in
the
deira
all
would
become
captives
to
the
foe
he
called
his
men
around
him
and
reminded
them
of
the
oath
which
eight
years
before
on
the
renewal
of
the
war
they
had
taken
at
medea
that
they
would
never
forsake
him
in
any
danger
or
suffering
all
declared
themselves
ready
still
to
adhere
to
it
he
set
before
them
the
peril
of
the
people
in
the
deira
and
suggested
submission
all
the
warriors
cried
perish
women
and
children
so
long
as
you
are
safe
and
able
to
renew
the
battles
of
god
you
are
our
head
our
sultan
fight
or
surrender
as
you
will
we
will
follow
you
wherever
you
choose
to
lead
after
a
few
moments
pause
declared
that
the
struggle
was
over
the
tribes
were
tired
of
the
war
and
there
was
nothing
left
but
submission
he
would
ask
the
french
for
a
for
himself
and
his
family
and
for
all
who
chose
to
follow
him
to
another
mussulman
country
the
universal
answer
was
sultan
let
your
will
be
done
the
incessant
rain
rendered
it
impossible
to
write
down
any
terms
therefore
affixed
his
seal
to
a
piece
of
paper
and
despatched
it
in
charge
of
two
horsemen
to
the
french
general
as
a
sign
of
authorization
on
his
part
for
demands
to
be
verbally
made
it
was
lamoricière
who
received
the
two
emissaries
and
he
sent
a
verbal
reply
acceding
to
all
proposals
then
sent
a
letter
and
received
in
reply
a
written
promise
and
stipulation
that
the
sultan
and
his
family
should
be
conducted
to
jean
or
alexandria
the
new
the
duc
was
close
at
hand
and
on
the
evening
of
december
the
fallen
hero
attended
by
some
of
his
chiefs
and
men
escorted
by
five
hundred
french
cavalry
who
showed
great
respect
and
sympathy
for
the
captives
arrived
at
headquarters
attended
by
lamoricière
and
cavaignac
was
presented
to
the
son
of
louis
philippe
the
prince
pledged
himself
that
promise
and
stipulation
should
be
strictly
observed
he
knew
little
that
his
father
throne
was
about
to
fall
and
that
the
decision
as
to
fate
would
within
a
few
weeks
rest
in
far
different
hands
the
then
withdrew
to
his
deira
which
had
now
joined
the
french
encampment
on
the
next
morning
december
the
held
a
review
his
honored
prisoner
and
guest
riding
a
splendid
black
charger
of
the
purest
arab
breed
and
surrounded
by
his
chiefs
awaited
his
return
from
the
field
when
the
prince
approached
dismounted
and
offered
his
steed
as
a
present
in
testimony
of
his
gratitude
and
expressed
the
hope
that
he
might
always
bear
his
new
master
in
safety
and
happiness
the
duc
replied
i
accept
it
as
a
homage
rendered
to
france
the
protection
of
which
country
will
henceforth
be
ever
extended
toward
you
and
as
a
sign
that
the
past
is
forgotten
on
december
the
algerian
hero
embarked
with
his
family
and
followers
in
a
french
frigate
for
toulon
he
had
seen
the
last
of
his
native
land
lamoricière
accompanied
him
on
board
and
supplemented
his
poor
resources
with
a
present
of
four
thousand
francs
receiving
sword
in
return
the
of
january
paid
a
high
tribute
to
the
genius
and
ascendency
of
the
captive
in
these
words
the
subjugation
of
is
an
event
of
immense
importance
to
france
it
assures
the
tranquillity
of
our
conquest

the
mexican
war
john
bonner
when
president
polk
began
his
administration
the
united
states
government
had
become
involved
in
two
boundary
disputes
one
relating
to
oregon
the
other
to
texas
and
mexico
out
of
the
latter
came
the
mexican
war
concerning
the
political
causes
and
merits
of
which
there
were
then
and
ever
since
have
been
wide
differences
of
opinion
among
the
american
people
polk
election
by
the
democrats
in
had
turned
mainly
upon
the
question
of
annexing
texas
just
before
he
came
into
office
the
annexation
was
made
texas
claimed
as
her
western
boundary
the
rio
grande
mexico
held
that
the
western
limit
was
the
nueces
between
the
two
rivers
there
was
a
large
area
of
disputed
territory
the
texan
claim
was
opposed
by
many
american
statesmen
and
publicists
and
by
some
was
denounced
as
the
annexation
of
texas
had
been
as
an
aggressive
move
against
mexico
but
the
united
states
government
supported
the
cause
of
texas
general
zachary
taylor
who
had
served
in
the
war
of
and
afterward
in
several
indian
wars
took
command
of
the
army
in

in
in
january
he
was
ordered
to
occupy
positions
on
or
near
the
left
bank
of
the
rio
grande
del
norte
this
order
and
its
execution
have
been
held
by
some
writers
to
constitute
an
act
of
war
but
war
was
not
formally
declared
by
the
united
states
till
may
taylor
with
a
small
force
had
several
slight
encounters
with
mexican
troops
after
which
he
won
the
battle
of
palo

near
the

of

transferred
to
the
district
between
vera

and
the
city
of
mexico
the
capital
and
was
henceforth
conducted
for
the
united
states
by
general
winfield
scott
whose
previous
military
career
had
been
much
the
same
as

was
the
taking
of

with
the
aid
of
a

he
besieged
the

and
on
the
received
its
surrender
at

he
won
an
important
victory
that

toward
his
objective
the

reënforcements
gradually
reached
him
and
by
the
first
of

he
was
ready
to
move
on
the

with
about
eleven
thousand
men
from
this
stage
to
the
fall
of
the
capital
completing
the
conquest
of

country
bonner
account
gives
a
graphic
recital
of
events
the
city
was
held
by
americans
from
september
the
day
they
entered
it
until
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
february
which
ended
the
war
with
the
energy
that
characterized
santa
anna
throughout
the
mexican
war
he
had
prepared
for
a
desperate
defence
civil
strife
had
been
silenced
funds
raised
an
army
of
thousand
men
mustered
and
every
precaution
taken
which
genius
could
suggest
or
science
indicate
nature
had
done
much
for
him
directly
in
front
of
the
invading
army
lay
the
large
lakes
of
xochimilco
and
chalco
these
turned
vast
marshes
intersected
by
ditches
and
for
the
most
part
impassable
surrounded
the
city
on
the
east
and
the
south
on
which
side
scott
was
advancing
for
several
miles
the
only
approaches
were
by
causeways
and
these
santa
anna
had
taken
prodigious
pains
to
guard
the
national
road
to
vera
cruz
which
scott
must
have
taken
had
he
marched
on
the
north
side
of
the
lakes
was
commanded
by
a
fort
mounting
guns
on
an
impregnable
hill
called
el
peñon
should
he
turn
the
southern
side
of
the
lakes
a
field
of
lava
deemed
almost
impassable
for
troops
interposed
a
primary
obstacle
and
fortified
positions
at
san
antonio
san
angel
and
churubusco
with
an
intrenched
camp
at
contreras
were
likewise
to
be
surmounted
before
the
southern
causeways
could
be
reached
beyond
these
there
yet
remained
the
formidable
castle
of
chapultepec
and
the
strong
enclosure
of
molino
del
rey
to
be
stormed
before
the
city
gates
could
be
reached
powerful
batteries
had
been
mounted
at
all
these
points
and
ample
garrisons
detailed
to
serve
them
the
bone
and
muscle
of
mexico
were
there
goaded
by
defeat
santa
anna
never
showed
so
much
vigor
ambition
fired
valencia
patriotism
stirred
the
soul
of
alvarez
canalizo
maddened
by
the
odium
into
which
he
had
fallen
was
boiling
to
regain
his
soubriquet
of
the
lion
of
mexico
with
a
constancy
equal
to
anything
recorded
of
the
roman
senate
the
mexican
congress
on
learning
of
the
defeat
at
cerro
gordo
had
voted
unanimously
that
anyone
opening
negotiations
with
the
enemy
should
be
deemed
a
traitor
and
the
citizens
with
one
accord
had
ratified
the
vote
within
six
months
mexico
had
lost
two
splendid
armies
in
two
pitched
battles
against
the
troops
now
advancing
against
the
capital
but
she
never
lost
heart
and
her
spirit
quailed
not
the
engineers
reporting
that
the
fortress
on
el
peñon
could
not
be
carried
without
a
loss
of
the
army
scott
decided
to
move
by
the
south
of
the
lakes
and
worth
accordingly
advanced
leading
the
van
as
far
as
san
augustin
nine
miles
from
the
city
of
mexico
there
a
large
field
of
lava
known
as
the
pedregal
barred
the
way
on
the
one
side
two
miles
from
san
augustin
the
fortified
works
at
san
antonio
commanded
the
passage
between
the
field
and
the
lake
on
the
other
the
ground
was
so
much
broken
that
infantry
alone
could
advance
and
general
valencia
occupied
an
intrenched
camp
with
a
heavy
battery
near
the
village
of
contreras
three
miles
distant
scott
determined
to
attack
on
both
sides
and
sent
forward
general
william
j
worth
on
the
east
and
general
gideon
pillow
and
general
david
twiggs
on
the
west
the
latter
advanced
as
fast
as
possible
over
the
masses
of
lava
on
the
morning
of
the
and
by
a
couple
of
light
batteries
were
placed
in
position
and
opened
fire
on
the
mexican
camp
at
the
same
time
general
persifor
smith
conceived
the
plan
of
turning
valencia
left
and
hastened
along
the
path
through
the
pedregal
in
the
direction
of
a
village
called
san
jeronimo
colonel
riley
followed
pillow
sent
cadwallader
brigade
on
the
same
line
and
later
in
the
day
morgan
regiment
was
likewise
despatched
toward
that
point
they
drove
in
the
mexican
pickets
and
skirmishers
dispersed
a
few
parties
of
lancers
and
occupied
the
village
without
loss
seeing
the
movement
santa
anna
hastened
to
valencia
support
with
twelve
thousand
men
he
was
discovered
by
cadwallader
just
as
the
latter
gained
the
village
road
and
appreciating
the
vast
importance
of
preventing
a
junction
between
the
two
mexican
generals
that
gallant
officer
did
not
hesitate
to
draw
up
his
brigade
in
order
of
battle
so
broken
was
the
ground
that
santa
anna
could
not
see
the
amount
of
force
opposed
to
him
and
declined
the
combat
this
was
all
cadwallader
wanted
shields
brigade
was
advancing
through
the
pedregal
and
the
troops
which
had
already
crossed
were
rapidly
moving
to
the
rear
of
valencia
camp
night
too
was
close
at
hand
when
it
fell
smith
riley
and
commands
had
gained
the
point
they
sought
shields
joined
them
at
ten
and
at
midnight
captain
lee
crossed
the
pedregal
with
a
message
from
general
smith
to
general
scott
to
say
that
he
would
begin
the
attack
at
daybreak
next
morning
it
rained
all
night
and
the
men
lay
in
the
mud
without
fires
at
three
in
the
morning
august
the
word
was
passed
to
march
such
pitchy
darkness
covered
the
face
of
the
plain
that
smith
ordered
every
man
to
touch
his
front
file
as
he
marched
now
and
then
a
flash
of
lightning
lighted
the
narrow
ravine
occasionally
a
straggling
moonbeam
pierced
the
clouds
and
shed
an
uncertain
glimmer
on
the
heights
but
these
flitting
guides
served
only
to
make
the
darkness
seem
darker
the
soldiers
groped
their
way
stumbling
over
stones
and
brushwood
and
did
not
gain
the
rear
of
the
camp
till
day
broke
then
riley
bade
his
men
look
to
the
priming
of
their
guns
and
reload
those
which
the
rain
had
wet
with
the
first
ray
of
daylight
the
firing
had
begun
again
between
the
mexican
camp
and
ransom
corps
stationed
in
front
and
brigade
at
san
jeronimo
almost
at
the
same
moment
riley
began
to
ascend
the
height
in
the
rear
before
he
reached
the
crest
his
engineers
who
had
gone
forward
to
reconnoitre
came
running
back
to
say
that
his
advance
had
been
detected
that
two
guns
were
being
pointed
against
him
and
a
body
of
infantry
were
sallying
from
the
camp
the
news
braced
the
men
nerves
they
gained
the
ridge
and
stood
a
tremendous
volley
from
the
mexicans
without
flinching
hanson
of
the
seventh
a
gallant
officer
and
an
excellent
man
was
shot
down
with
many
others
but
the
mexicans
had
done
their
worst
with
steady
aim
the
volley
was
returned
and
ere
the
smoke
rose
a
cheer
rang
through
the
ravine
and
riley
fell
with
a
swoop
on
the
intrenchments
with
bayonet
and
butt
of
musket
the
second
and
seventh
drove
the
enemy
from
his
guns
leaping
into
his
camp
and
slaughtering
all
before
them
up
rushed
smith
own
brigade
on
the
left
driving
a
party
of
mexicans
before
them
and
charging
with
the
bayonet
straight
at
torrejon
cavalry
which
was
drawn
up
in
order
of
battle
defeat
was
marked
on
their
faces
valencia
was
nowhere
to
be
found
salas
strove
vainly
to
rouse
his
men
to
defend
themselves
with
energy
horse
smitten
with
panic
broke
and
fled
at
the
advance
of
our
infantry
riley
hurled
the
mexicans
from
their
camp
after
a
struggle
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
as
they
rushed
down
the
ravine
their
own
cavalry
rode
over
them
trampling
down
more
men
than
the
bayonet
and
ball
had
laid
low
on
the
right
as
they
fled
cadwallader
brigade
poured
in
a
destructive
volley
and
shields
throwing
his
party
across
the
road
obstructed
their
retreat
and
compelled
the
fugitives
to
yield
themselves
prisoners
of
war
the
only
fight
of
any
moment
had
taken
place
within
the
camp
there
for
a
few
minutes
the
mexicans
had
fought
desperately
two
of
our
regimental
colors
had
been
shot
down
but
finally
bone
and
sinew
had
triumphed
to
the
exquisite
delight
of
the
assailants
the
first
prize
of
victory
was
the
guns
had
abandoned
at
buena
vista
which
were
regained
by
his
own
regiment
twenty
other
guns
and
more
than
a
thousand
prisoners
including
officers
and
four
generals
were
likewise
captured
and
about
fifteen
hundred
mexicans
killed
and
wounded
the
american
loss
in
killed
wounded
and
missing
was
about
one
hundred
men
barely
taking
time
to
breathe
his
troops
smith
followed
in
pursuit
toward
the
city
by
ten
in
the
morning
he
reached
san
angel
which
santa
anna
evacuated
as
he
approached
the
and
the
generals
of
division
had
by
this
time
relieved
smith
of
his
command
scott
rode
to
the
front
and
in
a
few
brief
words
told
the
men
there
was
more
work
to
be
done
that
day
a
loud
cheer
from
the
ranks
was
the
reply
the
whole
force
then
advanced
to
coyacan
within
a
mile
of
churubusco
and
prepared
to
assault
the
place
santa
anna
considered
it
the
key
to
the
city
and
awaited
the
attack
in
perfect
confidence
with
thirty
thousand
men
the
defences
were
simple
on
the
west
in
the
direction
of
coyacan
stood
the
large
stone
convent
of
san
pablo
which
as
well
as
the
wall
and
breastworks
in
front
was
filled
with
infantry
and
which
contained
seven
heavy
guns
a
breastwork
connected
san
pablo
with
the
de
over
the
churubusco
river
four
hundred
yards
distant
this
was
the
easternmost
point
of
defence
and
formed
part
of
the
san
antonio
causeway
leading
to
the
city
it
was
a
work
constructed
with
the
greatest
skill
bastions
curtain
and
wet
ditch
everything
was
complete
and
perfect
four
guns
were
mounted
in
embrasure
and
barbette
and
as
many
men
as
the
place
would
hold
were
stationed
there
the
reserves
occupied
the
causeway
behind
churubusco
independently
of
his
defences
santa
anna
numbers
nearly
five
to
one
should
have
insured
the
repulse
of
the
assailants
by
eleven
hardly
seven
hours
having
elapsed
since
the
contreras
camp
had
been
stormed
five
miles
away
twiggs
and
pillow
were
in
motion
toward
the
san
antonio
causeway
nothing
had
been
heard
of
worth
who
had
been
directed
to
move
along
the
east
side
of
the
pedregal
on
san
antonio
but
it
was
taken
for
granted
he
had
carried
the
point
and
scott
wished
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
garrison
twiggs
was
advancing
cautiously
toward
the
convent
when
a
heavy
firing
was
heard
in
advance
supposing
that
a
reconnoitring
party
had
been
attacked
he
hastily
sent
forward
the
first
artillery
under
dimmick
through
a
field
of
tall
corn
to
support
them
no
sooner
had
they
separated
from
the
main
body
than
a
terrific
discharge
of
grape
canister
and
musketry
assailed
them
from
the
convent
in
the
teeth
of
the
storm
they
advanced
to
within
one
hundred
yards
of
that
building
and
a
light
battery
under
taylor
was
brought
up
on
their
right
and
opened
on
the
convent
more
than
an
hour
the
gunners
stood
firm
to
their
pieces
under
afire
as
terrible
as
troops
ever
endured
of
the
command
had
fallen
before
they
were
withdrawn
colonel
riley
meanwhile
with
the
stormers
of
contreras
had
been
despatched
to
assail
san
pablo
on
the
west
and
like
dimmick
was
met
by
a
murderous
rain
of
shot
whole
heads
of
companies
were
mowed
down
at
once
thus
captain
smith
fell
twice
wounded
with
every
man
beside
him
and
a
single
discharge
from
the
mexican
guns
swept
down
lieutenant
easley
and
the
division
he
led
it
was
the
second
time
that
day
the
gallant
second
had
served
as
targets
for
the
mexicans
but
not
a
man
fell
back
general
smith
ordered
up
the
third
in
support
and
these
protecting
themselves
as
best
they
could
behind
a
few
huts
kept
up
a
steady
fire
on
the
convent
sallies
from
the
works
were
continually
made
and
as
continually
repelled
but
not
a
step
could
the
assailants
make
in
advance
by
this
time
the
battle
was
raging
at
three
different
points
worth
had
marched
on
san
antonio
that
morning
found
it
evacuated
and
given
chase
to
the
mexicans
with
the
fifth
and
sixth
infantry
the
causeway
leading
from
san
antonio
to
the
de
of
churubusco
was
thronged
with
flying
horse
and
foot
our
troops
dashed
headlong
after
them
never
halting
till
the
advance
corps
the
sixth
were
within
short
range
of
the
mexican
batteries
a
tremendous
volley
from
the
de
in
front
and
the
convent
on
the
flank
then
forced
them
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
rest
of
the
division
this
was
the
fire
which
twiggs
heard
when
he
sent
dimmick
against
the
convent
worth
came
up
almost
immediately
and
directing
the
sixth
to
advance
as
best
they
could
along
the
causeway
in
the
teeth
of
the
de
despatched
garland
and
clarke
brigades
through
the
fields
on
the
right
to
attack
it
in
flank
every
gun
was
instantly
directed
against
the
assailants
and
though
the
day
was
bright
and
clear
the
clouds
of
smoke
actually
darkened
the
air
hoffman
waving
his
sword
cheered
on
the
sixth
but
the
shot
tore
and
ripped
up
their
ranks
to
such
a
degree
that
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
lost
men
the
brigades
on
the
right
suffered
as
severely
one
hundred
men
fell
within
the
space
of
an
acre
still
they
pressed
on
till
the
eighth
of
clarke
brigade
reached
the
ditch
in
they
plunged
lieutenant
longstreet
bearing
the
colors
in
advance
he
scrambled
out
on
the
other
side
dashed
at
the
walls
without
ladders
or
scaling
implements
and
bayoneted
the
defenders
as
they
took
aim
at
last
officers
and
men
mixed
some
through
the
embrasures
some
over
the
walls
rushed
or
leaped
in
and
drove
the
garrison
upon
their
reserves
the
de
gained
its
guns
were
turned
on
the
convent
whence
the
mexicans
were
still
slaughtering
our
gallant
second
and
third
duncan
battery
too
hitherto
in
reserve
was
brought
up
and
opened
with
such
rapidity
that
a
bystander
estimated
the
intervals
between
the
reports
at
three
seconds
stunned
by
this
novel
attack
the
garrison
of
san
pablo
slackened
fire
in
an
instant
the
third
followed
by
artillery
dashed
forward
with
the
bayonet
to
storm
the
nearest
bastion
with
a
run
they
carried
it
the
artillery
bursting
over
the
curtain
but
at
that
moment
a
dozen
white
flags
waved
in
their
faces
the
whole
fortified
position
of
churubusco
was
taken
meantime
however
a
conflict
as
deadly
as
either
of
these
was
raging
behind
the
mexican
fortifications
soon
after
the
battle
commenced
scott
sent
pierce
and
shields
brigades
by
the
left
through
the
fields
to
attack
the
enemy
in
the
rear
on
the
causeway
opposed
to

were
planted
santa
anna
reserves
four
thousand
foot
and
three
thousand
horse
in
a
measure
protected
by
a
dense
growth
of
maguey
shields
advanced
intrepidly
with
his
force
of
sixteen
hundred
the
ground
was
marshy
and
for
a
long
distance
having
vainly
endeavored
to
outflank
the
enemy
his
advance
was
exposed
to
their
whole
fire
morgan

the
fifteenth

the
new

suffered
fearfully
and
their
leader
colonel

was
disabled
the
palmettos
of

and
the

were
as
severely
cut
up
and
after
a
while
all
sought
shelter
in
and
about
a
large
barn
near
the
causeway
shields
in
an
agony
at
the
failure
of
his
movement
cried
imploringly
for

to

him
the
appeal
was
instantly
answered
by
colonel
butler
of
the
palmettos
every
south
carolinian
will
follow
you
to
the

the
cry
was
contagious
and
most
of
the
new

took
it
up
forming
at
angles
to
the
causeway
shields
led
these
brave
men
under
an
incessant
hail
of
shot
against
the
village
of
portales
where
the
mexican
reserves
were
posted
not
a
trigger
was
pulled
till
they
stood
at
a
hundred
fifty
yards
from

then
the

poured
in
their
volley

few
minutes
more
and
there
will
be
no

left
to

the
glorious

but
at
this
very
moment
a
deafening
roar
is
heard
in
the
direction
of
the
de
round
shot
and
grape
and
canister
come
crashing
down
the
causeway
into
the
mexican
ranks
from

there
the

just
in
time
down
the
road
and
over
the
ditch
through
the
field
and
hedge
and
swamp
in
tumult
and
panic
the
mexicans
are
flying
from
the
bayonets
of
the
sixth
and
garland
brigade
a
shout
louder
than
the
cannon
peal

on
their
heels
with

men
before

reaches
the

he
is
by

not
till
then
does
he
perceive
that
he
is
alone
with
his
little
party
nearly
all
of
whom
are
wounded
but
despite
the
hundreds
of
that
are
levelled
at
him
he
gallops
back
in
safety
to
headquarters
the
sun
which
rose
that
morning
on
a
proud
army
and
a
defiant
metropolis
set
at
even
on
a
shattered
haggard
band
and
a
city
full
of
wretches
who
did
nothing
all
night
but
quake
with
terror
and

viene
los
here
come
the
yankees
all
along
the
causeway
and
in
the
fields
and
swamps
on
either
side
heaps
of
dead
men
and
cattle
intermingled
with
broken
marked
where
the
american
shot
had
told
a
gory
track
leading
to
the
de
groups
of
dead
in
the
fields
on
the
west
of
churubusco
over
whose
pale
faces
some
stalks
of
tattered
corn
still
waved
red
blotches
in
the
marsh
next
the
causeway
where
the
rich
blood
of
carolina
and
new
york
soaked
the
earth
showed
where
the
fire
of
the
heavy
mexican
guns
and
the
countless
of
the
infantry
had
been
most
murderous
scott
had
lost
in
that
day
work
more
than
a
thousand
men
in
killed
and
wounded
of
whom
were
officers
the
mexican
loss
according
to
santa
anna
was
of
his
army
equal
probably
to
ten
thousand
men
of
whom
were
prisoners
the
rest
killed
and
wounded
as
the
sun
went
down
the
troops
were
recalled
to
headquarters
but
all
night
long
the
battlefield
swarmed
with
straggling
parties
seeking
some
lost
comrade
in
the
cold
and
rain
and
surgeons
hurrying
from
place
to
place
and
offering
succor
to
the
wounded
it
would
have
been
easy
for
scott
to
march
on
the
city
that
night
or
next
morning
and
seize
it
before
the
mexicans
recovered
from
the
shock
of
their
defeat
anxious
to
shorten
the
war
and
assured
that
santa
anna
was
desirous
of
negotiating
warned
moreover
by
neutrals
and
others
that
the
hostile
occupation
of
the
capital
would
destroy
the
last
chance
of
peaceable
accommodation
and
rouse
the
mexican
spirit
to
resistance
all
over
the
country
the
american
general
consented
too
generously
perhaps
to
offer
an
armistice
to
his
vanquished
foe
it
was
eagerly
accepted
and
negotiations
were
commenced
which
lasted
over
a
fortnight
in
the
mean
time
general
scott
had
the
satisfaction
of
hanging
several
of
the
irishmen
who
had
deserted
to
the
mexicans
and
serving
as
the
battalion
of
san
patricio
had
shot
down
so
many
of
their
old
comrades
at
buena
vista
and
churubusco
this
act
of
justice
was
approved
by
the
army
and
the
nation
early
in
september
the
treachery
of
the
mexicans
became
apparent
no
progress
had
been
made
in
the
negotiations
and
in
defiance
of
the
armistice
an
american
wagon
proceeding
to
the
city
for
provisions
had
been
attacked
by
the
mob
and
one
man
killed
and
others
wounded
scott
wrote
to
santa
anna
demanding
an
apology
and
threatening
to
terminate
the
armistice
on
the
if
it
were
not
tendered
the
reply
was
insulting
in
the
extreme
santa
anna
had
repaired
his
losses
and
was
ready
for
another
fight
on
the
evening
of
september
worth
and
his
officers
were
gathered
in
his
quarters
at
tacubaya
on
a
table
lay
a
hastily
sketched
map
showing
the
position
of
the
fortified
works
at

with
the
casa
mata
on
one
side
and
the
castle
of
chapultepec
on
the
other
the
molino
was
occupied
by
the
enemy
there
was
reason
to
believe
it
contained
a
foundry
in
full
operation
and

had
been
directed
to
storm
it
next
morning

dreaming
that
a

corpses
stretched
upon
the
plain
fierce
old
covered
with
scars
worth
himself
his
manly

clouded
and
his
cheek
paled
by
sickness
and
anxiety
each
officer
had
his
place
assigned
to
him
in
the
conflict
and
they
parted
to
seek
a
few
hours
rest
at
two
on
the
morning
of
the
the
division
was
astir
was
a
bright
starlight
night
whose
silence
was
unbroken
as
the
troops
moved
thoughtfully
toward
the
battlefield
in
front
on
the
right
about
a
mile
from
the
encampment
the
walls
of
the
molino
del
rey
a
range
of
buildings
five
hundred
yards
long
and
well
adapted
for
defence
were
distinctly
visible
with
drowsy
lights
twinkling
through
the
windows
a
little
farther
off
on
the
left
stood
the
black
pile
of
the
casa
mata
the
arsenal
crenelled
for
musketry
and
surrounded
by
a
quadrangular
field
work
beyond
the
casa
mata
lay
a
ravine
and
from
this
a
ditch
and
hedge
ran
passing
in
front
of
both
works
to
the
tacubaya
road
far
on
the
right
the
grim
old
castle
of
chapultepec
loomed
up
darkly
against
the
sky
sleep
wrapped
the
whole
mexican
line
and
but
few
words
were
spoken
in
the
american
ranks
as
the
troops
took
up
their
respective
positions
garland
with
dunn
battery
and
on
the
right
against
the
molino
wright
at
the
head
of
the
stormers
and
followed
by
the
light
division
under
captain
kirby
smith
in
the
centre
with
duncan
battery
on
the
left
near
the
ravine
looking
toward
the
casa
mata
and
cadwallader
with
his
brigade
in
reserve
night
still
overhung
the
east
when
the
mexicans
were
roused
from
their
slumbers
by
the
roar
of
huger
and
the
crashing
of
the
balls
through
the
roof
and
walls
of
the
molino
a
shout
arose
within
their
lines
spreading
from
the
ravine
to
the
castle
lights
flashed
in
every
direction
bugles
sounded
the
clank
of
arms
rang
from
right
to
left
and
every
man
girded
himself
for
the
fray
with
the
first
ray
of
daylight
major
wright
advanced
with
the
forlorn
hope
down
the
slope
a
few
seconds
elapsed
then
a
sheet
of
flame
burst
from
the
batteries
and
round
shot
canister
and
grape
hurtled
through
the
air
charge
shouted
the
leader
and
down
they
went
with
step
over
the
ditch
and
hedge
and
into
the
line
sweeping
everything
before
them
the
mexicans
fell
from
their
guns
but
soon
seeing
the
smallness
of
the
force
opposed
to
them
and
reassured
by
the
galling
fire
poured
from
the
and
molino
on
the
stormers
they
rallied
charged
furiously
and
drove
our
men
back
into
the
plain
here
eleven
out
of
the
fourteen
officers
of
wright
party
and
the
bulk
of
his
men
fell
killed
or
wounded
all
of
the
latter
who
could
not
fly
were
bayoneted
where
they
lay
by
the
mexicans
captain
walker
of
the
sixth
badly
shot
was
left
for
dead
he
saw
the
enemy
murdering
every
man
who
showed
signs
of
life
but
the
agony
of
thirst
was
so
insupportable
that
he
could
not
resist
raising
his
canteen
to
his
lips
a
dozen
balls
instantly
tore
up
the
ground
around
him
several
mexicans
rushed
at
him
with
the
bayonet
but
at
that
moment
the
light
division
under
kirby
smith
came
charging
over
the
ditch
into
the
mexican
line
and
diverted
their
attention
garland
meanwhile
moved
down
rapidly
on
the
right
with
dunn
guns
which
were
drawn
by
hand
all
the
horses
having
been
wounded
and
become
unmanageable
these
soon
opened
an
enfilading
fire
on
the
mexican
battery
and
some
of
the
gunners
flying
the
light
division
charged
under
a
hot
fire
and
carried
the
guns
for
the
second
time
their
gallant
leader
was
shot
dead
in
the
charge
but
the
enemy
could
afford
to
lose
the
battery
from
the
tops
of
the
from
the
casa
mata
and
the
molino
a
deadly
shower
of
balls
was
rained
crosswise
upon
the
assailants
part
of
the
reserve
was
brought
up
and
dunn
guns
and
the
mexican
battery
were
served
upon
the
buildings
without
much
effect
at
first
graham
led
a
party
of
the
eleventh
against
the
latter
when
within
a
terrific
volley
assailed
him
wounding
him
in
ten
places
the
gallant
soldier
quietly
dismounted
pointed
with
his
sword
to
the
building
cried
charge
and
sank
dead
on
the
field
as
fiercely
raged
the
battle
at
the
other
wing
where
duncan
and
had
driven
in
the
enemy
right
toward
the
casa
mata
started
to
storm
that
fort
and
in
the
teeth
of
a
tremendous
hail
of
musketry
advanced
to
the
ditch
only
yards
from
the
work
there
a
ball
knocked
him
down
it
was
his
luck
to
be
shot
or
bayoneted
in
every
battle
martin
scott
took
the
command
but
as
he
ordered
the
men
forward
he
rolled
lifeless
into
the
ditch
major
waite
the
next
in
rank
had
hardly
seen
him
fall
before
he
too
was
disabled
by
whole
companies
the
men
were
mowed
down
by
the
mexican
shot
but
they
stood
their
ground
at
length
some
one
gave
the
word
to
fall
back
and
the
remnants
of
the
brigade
obeyed
many
wounded
were
left
on
the
ground
among
others
lieutenant
burnell
shot
in
the
leg
whom
the
mexicans
murdered
when
his
comrades
abandoned
him
after
the
battle
his
body
was
found
and
beside
it
his
dog
moaning
piteously
and
licking
his
dead
master
face
at
the
head
of
four
thousand
cavalry
alvarez
now
menaced
our
left
duncan
watched
them
come
driving
a
cloud
of
dust
before
them
till
they
were
within
close
range
then
opening
with
his
wonderful
rapidity
he
shattered
whole
platoons
at
a
discharge
worth
sent
him
word
to
be
sure
to
keep
the
lancers
in
check
tell
general
worth
was
his
reply
to
make
himself
perfectly
easy
i
can
whip
twenty
thousand
of
them
so
far
as
alvarez
was
concerned
he
kept
his
word
on
the
american
right
the
fight
had
reached
a
crisis
mixed
confusedly
together
men
of
all
arms
furiously
attacked
the
molino
firing
into
every
aperture
climbing
to
the
roof
and
striving
to
batter
in
the
doors
and
gates
with
their
muskets
the
garrison
never
slackened
their
terrible
fire
for
an
instant
at
length
major
buchanan
of
the
fourth
succeeded
in
bursting
open
the
southern
gate
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
anderson
and
ayres
of
the
artillery
forced
their
way
into
the
buildings
at
the
northwestern
angle
ayres
leaped
down
alone
into
a
crowd
of
mexicans
he
had
done
the
same
at
monterey
and
fell
covered
with
wounds
our
men
rushed
in
on
both
sides
stabbing
firing
and
felling
the
mexicans
with
their
muskets
from
room
to
room
and
house
to
house
a
encounter
was
kept
up
here
a
stalwart
mexican
hurled
down
man
after
man
as
they
advanced
there
buchanan
and
the
fourth
levelled
all
before
them
but
the
mexicans
never
withstood
the
cold
steel
one
by
one
the
defenders
escaped
by
the
rear
toward
chapultepec
and
those
who
remained
hung
out
a
white
flag
under
duncan
fire
the
casa
mata
had
been
evacuated
and
the
enemy
was
everywhere
in
full
retreat
twice
he
rallied
and
charged
the
molino
but
each
time
the
artillery
drove
him
back
toward
chapultepec
and
parties
of
the
light
infantry
pursued
him
down
the
road
before
ten
in
the
morning
the
whole
field
was
won
and
having
blown
up
the
casa
mata
worth
by
scott
order
fell
back
to
tacubaya
with
gloomy
face
and
averted
eye
the
gallant
soldier
received
the
thanks
of
his
chief
for
the
exploits
of
the
morning
his
heart
was
with
the
brave
men
he
had
lost
nearly
eight
hundred
out
of
less
than
hundred
and
among
them
officers
many
of
whom
were
his
dearest
friends
all
had
fallen
in
advance
of
their
men
with
sword
in
hand
and
noble
words
on
their
lips
was
a
poor
price
for
these
to
have
stormed
molino
del
rey
and
cut
down
nearly
a
fifth
of
santa
fourteen
thousand
men
sadly
the
general
returned
to
his
quarters
the
end
was
now
close
at
hand
reconnoissances
were
carefully
made
and
the
enemy
strength
being
gathered
on
the
southern
front
of
the
city
general
scott
determined
to
assail
chapultepec
on
the
west
by
the
morning
of
the
the
batteries
were
completed
and
opened
a
brisk
fire
on
the
castle
without
however
doing
any
more
serious
damage
than
annoying
the
garrison
and
killing
a
few
men
the
fire
was
kept
up
all
day
and
at
night
preparations
were
made
for
the
assault
which
was
ordered
to
be
made
next
morning
at
daybreak
on
the
the
cannonade
began
again
as
well
from
the
batteries
planted
against
chapultepec
as
from
steptoe
guns
which
were
served
against
the
southern
defences
of
the
city
in
order
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
enemy
at
the
firing
from
the
former
ceased
and
the
attack
commenced
quitman
advanced
along
the
tacubaya
road
pillow
from
the
molino
del
rey
which
he
had
occupied
on
the
evening
before
between
the
molino
and
the
castle
lay
first
an
open
space
then
a
grove
thickly
planted
with
trees
in
the
latter
mexican
sharpshooters
had
been
posted
protected
by
an
intrenchment
on
the
border
of
the
grove
pillow
sent
johnston
with
a
party
of
to
turn
this
work
by
a
flank
movement
it
was
handsomely
accomplished
and
just
as
the
broke
through
the
redan
pillow
with
the
main
body
charged
it
in
front
and
drove
back
the
mexicans
the
grove
gained
pillow
pressed
forward
to
the
front
of
the
rock
for
the
mexican
shot
from
the
castle
batteries
crashing
through
the
trees
seemed
even
more
terrible
than
it
really
was
and
the
troops
were
becoming
restless
the
mexicans
had
retreated
to
a
redoubt
half
way
up
the
hill
the
sprang
up
from
rock
to
rock
firing
as
they
advanced
and
followed
by
hooker
chase
and
others
with
parties
of
infantry
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
redoubt
was
gained
the
garrison
driven
up
the
hill
and
the
ninth
and
fifteenth
were
in
hot
pursuit
after
them
the
firing
from
the
castle
was
very
severe
colonel
ransom
of
the
ninth
was
killed
and
pillow
himself
was
wounded
still
the
troops
pressed
on
till
the
crest
of
the
hill
was
gained
there
some
moments
were
lost
owing
to
the
delay
in
the
arrival
of
during
which
two
of
quitman
regiments
and
clarke
brigade
reenforced
the
storming
party
when
the
ladders
came
numbers
of
men
rushed
forward
with
them
leaped
into
the
ditch
and
planted
them
for
the
assault
lieutenant
selden
was
the
first
man
to
mount
but
the
mexicans
collected
all
their
energies
for
this
last
moment
a
tremendous
fire
dashed
the
foremost
of
the
stormers
into
the
ditch
killing
lieutenants
rogers
and
smith
and
clearing
the
ladders
fresh
men
instantly
manned
them
and
after
a
brief
struggle
captain
howard
of
the
gained
a
foothold
on
the
parapet
of
the
forlorn
hope
followed
and
a
crowd
of
and
infantry
shouting
and
cheering
pressed
after
him
and
swept
down
upon
the
garrison
with
the
bayonet
almost
at
the
same
moment
johnston
of
the
who
had
led
a
small
party
round
to
the
gate
of
the
castle
broke
it
open
and
effected
an
entrance
in
spite
of
a
fierce
fire
from
the
southern
walls
the
two
parties
uniting
a
deadly
conflict
ensued
within
the
building
maddened
by
the
recollection
of
the
murder
of
their
wounded
comrades
at
molino
del
rey
the
stormers
at
first
showed
no
quarter
on
every
side
the
mexicans
were
stabbed
or
shot
down
without
mercy
many
flung
themselves
over
the
parapet
and
down
the
hillside
and
were
dashed
in
pieces
against
the
rocks
more
fought
like
fiends
expending
their
breath
in
a
malediction
and
expiring
in
the
act
of
aiming
a
treacherous
blow
as
they
lay
on
the
ground
streams
of
blood
flowed
through
the
doors
of
the
college
and
every
room
and
passage
was
the
theatre
of
some
deadly
struggle
at
length
the
officers
succeeded
in
putting
an
end
to
the
carnage
and
the
remaining
mexicans
having
surrendered
the
stars
and
stripes
were
hoisted
over
the
castle
of
chapultepec
by
major
seymour
meanwhile
quitman
had
stormed
the
batteries
on
the
causeway
to
the
east
of
the
castle
after
a
desperate
struggle
in
which
major
twiggs
who
commanded
the
stormers
was
shot
dead
at
the
head
of
his
men
the
mexicans
fell
back
toward
the
city
general
scott
coming
up
at
this
moment
ordered
a
simultaneous
advance
to
be
made
on
the
city
along
the
two
roads
leading
from
chapultepec
to
the
gates
of
san

an

supported
by

along

planted
fresh

such
spirit
into
the

that
quitman

terrific
storm
of

down

himself
fell
and
immediately
afterward
lieutenant

his
first
sergeant
met
the

fate
the

in

parties

the

at

deep
curses

their

the
street
resounds
with
the
heavy
tramp
of

famine
in

sir

duffy
from
the
fact
that
its
immediate
cause
was
the
almost
complete
failure
of
the
potato
crop
due
to
the
rot
the
great
irish
famine
is
known
as
the
potato
famine
the
crop
that
suffered
so
was
that
of
and
the
famine
began
in
the
following
year
and
reached
its
climax
in
it
is
estimated
that
by
this
calamity
two
hundred
thousand
persons
perished
many
compensating
features
in
connection
with
this
appalling
distress
have
been
pointed
out
some
writers
friendly
toward
ireland
have
declared
that
the
famine
proved
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
to
the
country
that
it
hastened
free
trade
better
drainage
of
the
island
and
the
passage
of
the
land
improvement
act
that
it
relieved
the
overcrowded
labor
market
led
to
more
scientific
farming
and
in
other
ways
produced
changes
that
have
been
of
lasting
benefit
but
though
all
this
be
true
the
misfortune
itself
gave
to
modern
history
one
of
its
most
harrowing
chapters
the
population
of
ireland
in
is
supposed
to
have
been
nearly
nine
millions
the
manufactures
were
small
and
the
people
depended
on
the
potato
crop
and
had
no
other
resource
in
time
of
scarcity
for
several
years
the
potato
yield
had
been
abundant
the
country
was
comparatively
prosperous
and
the
temperance
movement
led
by
father
mathew
promised
a
happier
future
a
great
harvest
was
expected
in
but
almost
at
a
single
stroke
this
expectation
was
blasted
for
although
the
crop
was
large
the
greater
part
of
it
was
destroyed
in
the
ground
and
the
potatoes
that
were
gathered
rotted
in
pit
and
storehouse
the
farmers
taxed
all
their
means
and
energies
to
secure
even
a
larger
crop
in
but
the
blight
of
that
year
was
even
more
fatal
than
the
last
to
pinching
want
was
added
discouragement
and
the
people
sat
in
the
shadow
of
a
frightful
catastrophe
in
vain
the
british
government
was
called
upon
to
give
relief
through
parliament
until
in
the
autumn
of
parliamentary
authority
was
obtained
to
grant
baronial
loans
but
these
and
every
local
endeavor
to
mitigate
the
suffering
failed
and
the
destructive
work
of
the
famine
continued
the
number
of
victims
increasing
to
the
end
of
that
fatal
year
the
horrors
of
were
more
than
equalled
by
those
of
the
year
that
followed
and
the
woful
picture
presented
by
sir
charles
gavan
duffy
the
distinguished
irish
patriot
statesman
and
historian
is
but
too
amply
justified
by
the
accepted
records
of
the
time
the
condition
of
ireland
at
the
opening
of
the
year
is
one
of
the
most
painful
chapters
in
the
annals
of
mankind
an
industrious
and
hospitable
race
were
in
the
pangs
of
a
devouring
famine
deaths
of
individuals
of
husband
and
wife
of
entire
families
were
becoming
common
the
had
spread
from
the
atlantic
to
the
caspian
but
there
was
more
suffering
in
one
parish
of
mayo
than
in
all
the
rest
of
europe
from
connaught
where
distress
was
greatest
came
batches
of
inquests
with
the
horrible
verdict
died
of
starvation
in
some
instances
the
victims
were
buried
wrapped
in
a
coarse
coverlet
a
coffin
being
too
costly
a
luxury
the
living
awaited
death
with
a
listlessness
that
was
at
once
tragic
and
revolting
women
with
dead
children
in
their
arms
were
seen
begging
for
a
coffin
to
bury
them
béranger
has
touched
a
thousand
hearts
by
the
picture
of
who
when
the
came
in
the
king
name
was
discovered
dead
on
his
miserable
pallet
but
at
skibbereen
in
the
fruitful
county
cork
whose
seaports
were
thronged
with
vessels
laden
with
corn
cattle
and
butter
for
england
the
rate
collector
told
a
more
tragic
tale
some
houses
he
found
deserted
the
owners
had
been
carried
to
their
graves
in
one
cabin
there
was
no
other
occupant
than
three
corpses
in
a
once
prosperous
home
a
woman
and
her
children
had
lain
dead
and
unburied
for
a
week
in
the
fields
a
man
was
discovered
so
fearfully
mangled
by
dogs
that
identification
was
impossible
the
relief
committee
of
the
society
of
friends
described
the
state
of
the
town
in
language
which
it
was
hard
to
read
with
dry
eyes
the
people
were
dying
of
the
unaccustomed
food
which
mocked
their
prayer
for
daily
bread
and
were
carried
to
the
graveyard
in
a
coffin
from
which
the
benevolent
strangers
who
had
come
to
their
relief
had
to
drop
them
like
dead
dogs
that
there
might
be
a
covering
for
the
next
corpse
in
its
turn
this
place
is
one
mass
of
famine
disease
and
death
the
poor
creatures
hitherto
trying
to
exist
on
one
meal
a
day
are
now
sinking
under
fever
and
bowel
complaints
unable
to
come
for
their
soup
which
is
not
fit
for
them
rice
is
what
their
whole
cry
is
for
but
we
can
not
manage
this
well
nor
can
we
get
the
food
carried
to
the
houses
from
dread
of
infection
i
have
got
a
coffin
constructed
with
movable
sides
to
convey
the
bodies
to
the
churchyard
in
calico
bags
prepared
in
which
the
remains
are
wrapped
up
i
have
just
sent
it
to
bring
the
remains
of
a
poor
creature
to
the
grave
who
having
been
turned
out
of
the
only
shelter
she
had
a
miserable
hut
perished
the
night
before
last
in
a
quarry
the
people
saw
the
harvest
they
had
reared
carried
away
to
another
country
without
an
effort
for
the
most
part
to
retain
it
the
sole
food
of
the
distressed
class
was
which
had
paid
freight
and
storage
in
england
and
had
been
obtained
in
exchange
for
english
manufactures
under
a
recent
law
a
peasant
who
accepted
public
relief
forfeited
his
holding
and
thousands
were
ejected
under
this
cruel
provision
but
landowners
were
not
content
with
one
process
alone
they
closed
on
the
people
with
ejectments
turned
them
out
on
the
roads
and
plucked
down
their
rooftrees
in
more
than
one
county
rents
falling
due
in
november
for
land
that
no
longer
yielded
food
to
the
cultivator
were
enforced
in
january
in
the
southwest
the
peasantry
had
made
some
frantic
efforts
to
clutch
their
harvest
and
to
retaliate
for
their
sufferings
in
blind
vengeance
but
the
law
carried
a
sharp
sword
eight
counties
or
parts
of
counties
were
proclaimed
and
a
special
commission
after
a
brief
sitting
in
clare
and
limerick
left
eleven
peasants
for
the
gallows
chief
justice
blackburn
took
occasion
to
note
that
the
state
of
things
in
was
exactly
that
described
by
an
act
passed
in
the
disease
was
permanent
so
were
the
symptoms
one
of
irish
discontent
was
english
prejudice
which
refuses
to
listen
to
any
complaint
till
it
threatens
to
become
dangerous
it
was
a
fearful
time
for
men
who
loved
their
country
not
only
with
deep
affection
but
with
a
wise
and
forecasting
interest
a
revolution
of
the
worst
type
was
in
progress
not
the
present
alone
but
the
future
was
being
laid
waste
the
marvellous
reform
accomplished
by
father
mathew
the
which
had
grown
up
in
the
era
of
monster
meetings
and
the
moral
teachings
of
davis
and
his
friends
were
being
fast
swallowed
up
by
this
calamity
the
youth
and
manhood
of
the
middle
classes
were
scrambling
for
pauper
places
from
the
board
of
works
and
the
peasants
were
being
transformed
into
mendicants
by
process
of
law
these
calamities
related
of
a
distant
and
savage
tribe
would
move
a
generous
heart
but
seeing
them
befall
our
own
people
the
children
of
the
same
mother
and
foreseeing
all
the
black
unfathomable
misery
they
foreshadowed
it
was
hard
to
preserve
the
sober
rule
of
reason
the
gentry
who
were
responsible
in
the
first
place
for
the
protection
of
the
people
from
whom
they
drew
their
income
insisted
that
the
calamity
was
an
imperial
one
and
ought
to
be
borne
out
of
the
exchequer
of
the
empire
it
was
an
equitable
claim
if
there
was
no
irresistible
title
of
brotherhood
at
lowest
the
stronger
nation
had
snatched
away
from
the
weaker
the
power
of
helping
itself
and
still
drew
away
during
this
terrible
era
half
a
million
pounds
every
month
in
the
shape
of
absentee
rents
the
demand
was
put
aside
contemptuously
the
claim
of
the
nationalists
to
reënter
on
the
management
of
their
own
affairs
since
it
was
plain
england
could
not
manage
them
successfully
was
treated
as
sedition
we
were
proffered
instead
of
our
own
resources
which
were
ample
alms
from
scornful
hands
to
hands
in
chains
bitterer
to
taste
than
death
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
were
appealed
to
and
they
gave
generously
but
the
result
was
far
from
being
proportionate
to
the
need
during
the
year
the
contributions
fell
short
of
two
thousand
pounds
a
week
and
it
was
not
forgotten
that
after
the
great
fire
of
london
when
the
citizens
were
in
deep
distress
the
irish
contributed
twenty
thousand
fat
cattle
for
their
relief
which
at
their
present
value
would
amount
to
a
sum
greater
than
england
and
europe
sent
to
the
aid
of
ireland
in
to
lie
down
and
die
like
cattle
in
a
murrain
was
base
no
people
are
bound
to
starve
while
their
soil
produces
food
cultivated
by
their
own
hands
no
other
people
in
europe
would
have
submitted
to
such
a
fate
but
the
leader
whom
they
were
accustomed
to
follow
had
involved
himself
in
a
tangle
of
false
doctrines
by
his
unhappy
peace
resolutions
and
he
exhorted
them
to
endure
all
with
patience
and
submission
his
son
had
the
amazing
assurance
to
add
that
if
they
starved
with
complete
resignation
the
repeal
of
the
union
was
near
at
hand
on
the
relief
committees
doctors
clergymen
and
country
gentlemen
bore
the
burden
of
the
work
but
a
multitude
of
the
gentry
stood
apart
as
if
the
transaction
did
not
concern
them
they
were
busy
in
transferring
the
harvest
to
england
or
clearing
the
population
off
their
estates
the
english
officials
in
ireland
accused
them
of
jobbing
in
public
works
or
quartering
their
relations
and
dependents
on
the
relief
fund
as
overseers
and
in
some
extreme
cases
of
obtaining
grants
for
their
own
families
of
money
designed
for
the
suffering
poor
on
their
estates
the
benevolence
of
the
minority
could
not
counterbalance
these
odious
offences
and
deadly
hatred
was
sown
which
has
since
borne
an
abundant
harvest
the
state
of
the
country
grew
worse
from
day
to
day
it
is
difficult
now
to
realize
the
condition
of
the
western
population
in
the
autumn
of
but
a
witness
of
unexceptionable
impartiality
has
painted
it
in
permanent
colors
a
young
englishman
representing
the
society
of
friends
who
in
that
tragic
time
did
work
worthy
of
the
good
samaritan
reported
what
he
saw
in
mayo
and
galway
in
language
which
for
plain
vigor
rivals
the
narratives
of
defoe
this
is
what
he
saw
in
westport
the
town
of
westport
was
in
itself
a
strange
and
fearful
sight
like
what
we
read
of
in
beleaguered
cities
its
streets
crowded
with
gaunt
wanderers
sauntering
to
and
fro
with
hopeless
air
and
look
a
mob
of
starved
almost
naked
women
around
the
poorhouse
clamoring
for
soup
tickets
our
inn
the
headquarters
of
the
and
beset
by
a
crowd
begging
for
work
as
he
approached
galway
the
rural
population
were
found
to
be
in
a
more
miserable
condition
some
of
the
women
and
children
that
we
saw
on
the
road
were
abject
cases
of
poverty
and
almost
naked
the
few
rags
they
had
on
were
with
the
greatest
difficulty
held
together
and
in
a
few
weeks
as
they
are
utterly
unable
to
provide
themselves
with
fresh
clothes
unless
they
be
given
them
they
must
become
absolutely
naked
and
in
another
district
as
we
went
along
our
wonder
was
not
that
the
people
died
but
that
they
lived
and
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
in
any
other
country
the
mortality
would
have
been
far
greater
that
many
lives
have
been
prolonged
perhaps
saved
by
the
long
apprenticeship
to
want
in
which
the
irish
peasant
has
been
trained
and
by
that
lovely
touching
charity
which
prompts
him
to
share
his
scanty
meal
with
his
starving
neighbor
the
fishermen
of
the
cladagh
who
were
induced
to
send
the
whig
to
parliament
a
few
months
before
had
to
pledge
the
implements
of
their
calling
for
a
little
daily
bread
even
the
very
nets
and
tackle
of
these
poor
fishermen
i
heard
were
pawned
and
unless
they
be
assisted
to
redeem
them
they
will
be
unable
to
take
advantage
of
the
herring
shoals
even
when
they
approach
their
coast
in
order
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
this
statement
i
went
into
two
or
three
of
the
largest
pawnshops
the
owners
of
which
fully
confirmed
it
and
said
they
had
in
pledge
at
least
a
thousand
pounds
worth
of
such
property
and
saw
no
likelihood
of
its
being
redeemed
in
a
rural
district
which
he
revisited
after
an
interval
he
paints
a
scene
which
can
scarcely
be
matched
in
the
annals
of
a
mediaeval
plague
one
poor
woman
whose
cabin
i
visited
said
will
be
nothing
for
us
but
to
lie
down
and
die
i
tried
to
give
her
hope
of
english
aid
but
alas
her
prophecy
has
been
too
true
out
of
a
population
of
two
hundred
forty
i
found
thirteen
already
dead
from
want
the
survivors
were
like
walking
skeletons
the
men
gaunt
and
haggard
stamped
with
the
livid
mark
of
hunger
the
children
crying
with
pain
the
women
in
some
of
the
cabins
too
weak
to
stand
when
there
before
i
had
seen
cows
at
almost
every
cabin
and
there
were
besides
many
sheep
and
pigs
owned
in
the
village
but
now
all
the
sheep
were
gone
all
the
cows
all
the
poultry
killed
only
one
pig
left
the
very
dogs
which
had
barked
at
me
before
had
disappeared
no
potatoes
no
oats
the
young
man
pointed
the
moral
which
these
horrible
spectacles
suggested
with
laudable
courage
i
would
not
now
discuss
the
causes
of
this
condition
nor
attempt
to
apportion
blame
to
its
authors
but
of
this
one
fact
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
result
of
our
social
system
is
that
vast
numbers
of
our
of
the
peasantry
of
one
of
the
richest
nations
the
world
ever
knew
have
not
leave
to
live
surely
such
a
social
result
as
this
is
not
only
a
national
misfortune
but
a
national
sin
crying
loudly
to
every
christian
citizen
to
do
his
utmost
to
remove
it
no
one
of
us
can
have
a
right
to
enjoy
either
riches
or
repose
until
to
the
extent
of
his
ability
he
strive
to
wash
himself
of
all
share
in
the
guilt
of
this
fearful
inequality
which
will
be
a
blot
in
the
history
of
our
country
and
make
her
a
byword
among
the
nations
the
weekly
returns
of
the
dead
were
like
the
bulletins
of
a
fierce
campaign
as
the
end
of
the
year
approached
villages
and
rural
districts
which
had
been
prosperous
and
populous
a
year
before
were
desolate
in
some
places
the
loss
amounted
to
half
the
resident
population
even
the
poorhouses
shut
up
and
paupers
did
not
escape
more
than
one
in
six
perished
of
the
unaccustomed
food
the
people
did
not
everywhere
consent
to
die
patiently
in
armagh
and
down
groups
of
men
went
from
house
to
house
in
the
rural
districts
and
insisted
on
being
fed
in
tipperary
and
waterford
corn
stores
and
bakers
shops
were
sacked
in
donegal
the
people
seized
upon
a
and
pillaged
it
in
limerick
five
thousand
men
assembled
on
tory
hill
and
declared
that
they
would
not
starve
a
local
clergyman
restrained
them
by
the
promise
of
speedy
relief
if
the
government
did
not
act
promptly
he
himself
would
show
them
where
food
could
be
had
in
a
few
cases
crops
were
carried
away
from
farms
the
offences
which
spring
from
suffering
and
fear
were
heard
of
in
many
districts
but
they
were
encountered
with
instant
resistance
there
were
thirty
thousand
men
in
red
jackets
carefully
fed
clothed
and
lodged
ready
to
maintain
the
law
four
prisoners
were
convicted
at
the
galway
assizes
of
stealing
a
filly
which
they
killed
and
ate
to
preserve
their
own
lives
in
enniskillen
two
boys
under
twelve
years
of
age
were
convicted
of
stealing
one
pint
of
cooked
into
stirabout
and
chief
justice
blackburn
vindicated
the
outraged
law
by
transporting
them
for
seven
years
other
children
committed
larcenies
that
they
might
be
sent
to
jail
where
there
was
still
daily
bread
to
be
had
in
mayo
the
people
were
eating
carrion
wherever
it
could
be
procured
and
the
coroner
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
inquests
for
the
law
sometimes
spent
more
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
a
pauper
death
than
would
suffice
to
preserve
his
life
the
social
disorganization
was
a
spectacle
as
afflicting
as
the
waste
of
life
it
was
the
waste
of
whatever
makes
life
worth
possessing
all
the
institutions
which
civilize
and
elevate
the
people
were
disappearing
one
after
another
the
churches
were
half
empty
the
temperance
were
shut
up
the
mechanics
institute
no
longer
got
support
only
the
jails
and
the
poorhouses
were
crowded
a
new
generation
born
in
disease
and
reared
in
destitution
pitiless
and
imbecile
threatened
to
drag
down
the
nation
to
hopeless
slavery
trade
was
paralyzed
no
one
bought
anything
which
was
not
indispensable
at
the
hour
the
loss
of
the
farmers
in
potatoes
was
estimated
at
more
than
twenty
millions
sterling
and
with
the
potatoes
the
pigs
which
fed
on
them
disappeared
the
seed
procured
at
a
high
price
in
spring
again
failed
time
money
and
labor
were
lost
and
another
year
of
famine
was
certain
all
who
depended
on
the
farmer
had
sunk
with
him
shopkeepers
were
beggared
tradesmen
were
starving
the
priests
living
on
voluntary
offerings
were
sometimes
in
fearful
distress
when
the
people
had
no
longer
anything
to
offer
the
was
quite
inadequate
to
support
the
burden
thrown
upon
it
by
the
suspension
of
public
works
but
there
was
another
claim
upon
it
which
could
not
wait
when
the
elections
were
over
and
the
government
majority
secure
the
treasury
called
on
the
guardians
to
levy
immediately
a
special
rate
for
the
repayment
of
a
million
and
a
quarter
lent
by
the
state
in
a
previous
year
they
were
warned
that
if
they
refused
their
boards
would
be
dissolved
and
the
rates
levied
by
the
authority
of
the
commissioners
the
guardians
in
many
districts
declared
that
an
additional
rate
could
not
be
collected
all
that
could
be
got
would
be
too
little
to
support
the
distressed
class
but
the
treasury
would
listen
to
no
excuse
and
a
dozen
boards
were
dissolved
and
paid
guardians
put
in
their
place
the
treasury
had
lent
seven
millions
sterling
in
five
millions
of
it
had
been
spent
in
making
roads
which
were
not
needed
nor
desired
and
one
million
was
diverted
from
the
wages
fund
to
purchase
land
for
this
experiment
the
aid
which
the
stronger
country
proposed
to
give
to
the
weaker
from
the
treasury
to
which
both
contributed
was
the
remission
of
of
this
debt
a
blunder
in
foreign
policy
the
escapade
of
an
ambitious
minister
in
india
or
africa
has
cost
the
british
taxpayer
more
in
a
month
than
he
spent
to
save
millions
of
beyond
the
irish
sea
when
the
increased
mortality
was
pressed
on
the
attention
of
the
government
lord
john
russell
replied
that
the
owners
of
property
in
ireland
ought
to
support
the
poor
born
on
their
estates
it
was
a
perfectly
just
proposition
if
the
ratepayers
were
empowered
to
determine
the
object
and
method
of
the
expenditure
but
prohibiting
productive
work
and
forcing
them
to
turn
strong
men
into
paupers
and
keep
them
sweltering
in
workhouses
instead
of
laboring
to
reclaim
the
waste
lands
this
was
not
justice
the
commenting
on
the
new
policy
declared
that
ireland
was
as
well
able
to
help
herself
as
france
or
belgium
and
that
the
whole
earth
was
doing
duty
for
inhuman
irish
landlords
an
unanswerable
case
if
ireland
like
france
and
belgium
had
the
power
of
collecting
and
applying
her
own
revenue
otherwise
not
difficult
to
answer
the
people
fled
before
the
famine
to
england
america
and
the
british
colonies
they
carried
with
them
the
seed
of
disease
and
death
in
england
a
bishop
and
more
than
twenty
priests
died
of
typhus
caught
in
attendance
on
the
sick
and
dying
the
english
people
clamored
against
such
an
infliction
which
it
can
not
be
denied
would
be
altogether
intolerable
if
these
fugitives
were
not
made
exiles
and
paupers
by
english
law
they
were
ordered
home
again
that
they
might
be
supported
on
the
resources
of
their
own
country
for
though
we
had
no
country
for
the
purpose
of
and
we
were
acknowledged
to
have
a
country
when
the
necessity
of
bearing
burdens
arose
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
souls
fled
to
the
united
states
and
canada
the
united
states
maintained
sanitary
regulations
on
shipboard
which
were
effectual
to
a
certain
extent
but
the
emigration
to
canada
was
left
to
the
individual
greed
of
shipowners
and
the
rivalled
the
cabins
of
mayo
or
the
of
skibbereen
crowded
and
filthy
carrying
double
the
legal
number
of
passengers
who
were
and
imperfectly
clothed
and
having
no
doctor
on
board
the
holds
says
an
eyewitness
were
like
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
and
deaths
occurred
in
myriads
the
survivors
on
their
arrival
in
the
new
country
continued
to
die
and
to
scatter
death
around
them
at
montreal
during
nine
weeks
eight
hundred
emigrants
perished
and
over
nine
hundred
residents
died
of
diseases
caught
from
emigrants
during
six
months
the
deaths
of
the
new
arrivals
exceeded
three
thousand
no
preparations
were
made
by
the
british
government
for
the
reception
or
the
employment
of
these
helpless
multitudes
the

the
neglect
to
be
an
eternal
disgrace

british

in

not

in
a
commingled
heap
no

twenty
thousand
and

have
gone
down
to
their

this
was
the
fate
which
was
befalling
our
race
at
home
and
abroad
as
the
year
closed
there
were
not
many
of
us
who
would
not
have
given
our
lives
cheerfully
to
arrest
this
ruin
if
we
could
only
see
a
possible
way

no

migrations
of
the
mormons
thomas
kane
among
the
numerous
religious
bodies
that
have
grown
up
in
the
united
states
the
sect
of
mormons
officially
called
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
is
perhaps
the
most
unique
in
its
origin
and
organization
and
the
most
singular
in
its
history
the
sect
was
founded
in
by
joseph
smith
of
vermont
he
declared
that
he
had
discovered
one
of
its
authoritative
writings
the
of
at
cumorah
new
york
this
book
he
said
was
found
by
him
buried
in
the
earth
at
a
place
revealed
to
him
by
an
angel
according
to
the
mormons
the
book
written
in
mystic
characters
on
golden
plates
is
a
record
of
certain
ancient
people
the
tribes
of
israel
smith
declared
inhabiting
north
america
this
book
is
said
to
have
been
abridged
by
the
prophet
mormon
and
translated
by
smith
by
it
is
supposed
to
be
based
on
a
manuscript
romance
written
by
solomon
spaulding
the
mormon
church
is
governed
by
a
hierarchy
with
two
orders
of
priesthood
a
president
two
counsellors
twelve
apostles
and
elders
and
other
officers
peculiar
as
their
polity
appears
it
has
proved
remarkably
successful
in
the
development
of
their
church
and
community
notwithstanding
stern
hostility
and
widespread
disapproval
they
present
an
impressive
example
of
shrewdness
thrift
and
administrative
skill
resulting
in
great
material
prosperity
besides
their
separate
books
they
accept
the
bible
as
authoritative
and
many
of
their
doctrines
and
rites
resemble
those
common
to
the
christian
sects
more
than
anything
else
their
teaching
and
their
practice
of
polygamy
have
brought
them
into
collision
with
gentiles
and
with
the
united
states
government
the
first
mormon
settlement
was
at
kirtland
ohio
the
next
was
in
missouri
from
those
states
they
were
expelled
and
in
they
founded
nauvoo
in
illinois
their
later
experience
up
to
their
permanent
establishment
in
utah
is
recounted
in
the
following
narrative
of
the
hardships
endured
and
surmounted
by
this
extraordinary
people
but
it
should
be
added
that
the
cause
of
the
exodus
was
not
as
is
generally
supposed
religious
persecution
the
leaders
of
the
sect
at
nauvoo
had
set
up
a
bank
without
capital
and
passed
thousands
of
its
worthless
notes
upon
the
unsuspecting
farmers
and
traders
and
it
was
this
and
other
crimes
that
exasperated
the
inhabitants
of
that
region
to
the
point
of
driving
away
the
whole
community
of
mormons
once
while
ascending
the
upper
mississippi
in
the
autumn
when
its
waters
were
low
i
was
compelled
to
travel
by
land
past
the
region
of
the
rapids
my
road
lay
through
the
tract
a
fine
section
of
iowa
which
the
unsettled
state
of
its
land
titles
had
appropriated
as
a
sanctuary
for
coiners
horse
thieves
and
other
outlaws
i
had
left
my
steamer
at
keokuk
at
the
foot
of
the
lower
fall
to
hire
a
carriage
and
to
contend
for
some
fragments
of
a
dirty
meal
with
the
swarming
flies
the
only
scavengers
of
the
locality
from
this
place
to
where
the
deep
water
of
the
river
returns
my
eye
wearied
to
see
everywhere
sordid
vagabond
and
idle
settlers
and
a
country
marred
without
being
improved
by
their
careless
hands
i
was
descending
the
last
hillside
upon
my
journey
when
a
landscape
in
delightful
contrast
broke
upon
my
view
half
encircled
by
a
bend
of
the
river
a
beautiful
city
lay
glittering
in
the
fresh
morning
sun
its
bright
new
dwellings
set
in
cool
green
gardens
ranging
up
around
a
stately
hill
which
was
crowned
by
a
noble
marble
edifice
whose
high
tapering
spire
was
radiant
with
white
and
gold
the
city
appeared
to
cover
several
miles
and
beyond
it
in
the
background
spread
a
fair
rolling
country
checkered
by
symmetrical
lines
of
fruitful
husbandry
the
unmistakable
evidences
of
industry
enterprise
and
educated
wealth
everywhere
made
the
scene
one
of
singular
and
most
striking
beauty
it
was
a
natural
impulse
to
visit
this
inviting
region
i
procured
a
skiff
and
rowing
across
the
river
landed
at
the
principal
wharf
of
the
city
no
one
met
me
there
i
looked
and
saw
no
one
i
heard
no
movement
though
the
stillness
everywhere
was
such
that
i
heard
the
flies
buzz
and
the
ripples
break
against
the
shallows
of
the
beach
i
walked
through
the
solitary
streets
the
town
lay
as
in
a
dream
under
some
deadening
spell
of
loneliness
from
which
i
almost
feared
to
wake
it
plainly
it
had
not
slept
long
there
was
no
grass
growing
in
the
paved
ways
and
rain
had
not
washed
away
the
prints
of
footsteps
in
the
dust
yet
i
went
about
unchecked
i
went
into
empty
ropewalks
workshops
and
smithies
the
spinner
wheel
was
idle
the
carpenter
had
gone
from
his
workbench
and
left
his
sash
and
casing
unfinished
fresh
bark
was
in
the
tanner
vat
and
the
fresh
chopped
lightwood
stood
piled
against
the
baker
oven
the
blacksmith
shop
was
cold
but
his
and
and
crooked
were
all
there
as
if
he
had
just
gone
off
for
a
holiday
no
workpeople
anywhere
looked
to
know
my
errand
if
i
went
into
the
gardens
clinking
the
wicket
latch
loudly
after
me
to
pull
the
marigolds
heartsease
and
and
draw
a
drink
with
the
and
its
noisy
chain
or
knocking
off
with
my
stick
the
tall
dahlias
and
sunflowers
hunting
among
the
beds
for
cucumbers
and
no
one
called
out
to
me
from
any
opened
window
no
dog
sprang
forward
to
bark
an
alarm
i
could
have
supposed
the
people
hidden
in
the
houses
but
the
doors
were
unfastened
and
when
at
last
i
timidly
entered
i
found
dead
ashes
cold
upon
the
hearth
and
had
to
tread
on
tiptoe
as
if
walking
down
the
aisle
of
a
country
church
to
avoid
rousing
irreverent
echoes
from
the
naked
floors
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
was
the
city
graveyard
but
there
was
no
record
of
plague
there
nor
did
it
in
any
wise
differ
much
from
other
protestant
american
cemeteries
some
of
the
mounds
were
not
long
sodded
some
of
the
stones
were
newly
set
their
dates
recent
and
their
black
inscriptions
glossy
in
the
hardly
dried
beyond
the
graveyard
out
in
the
fields
i
saw
in
one
spot
hard
by
where
the
fruited
boughs
of
a
young
orchard
had
been
torn
down
the
still
smoldering
embers
of
a
barbecue
fire
that
had
been
constructed
of
rails
from
the
fencing
around
it
it
was
the
latest
sign
of
life
there
fields
upon
fields
of
grain
lay
rotting
ungathered
upon
the
ground
no
one
was
at
hand
to
take
in
their
rich
harvest
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
they
stretched
away
they
sleeping
too
in
the
hazy
air
of
autumn
only
two
portions
of
the
city
seemed
to
suggest
the
import
of
this
mysterious
solitude
in
the
southern
suburb
the
houses
looking
out
upon
the
country
showed
by
their
splintered
woodwork
and
walls
battered
to
the
foundation
that
they
had
lately
been
the
mark
of
a
destructive
cannonade
and
in
and
around
the
splendid
temple
which
had
been
the
chief
object
of
my
admiration
armed
men
were
barracked
surrounded
by
their
stacks
of
musketry
and
pieces
of
heavy
ordnance
these
challenged
me
to
render
an
account
of
myself
and
to
tell
the
reason
why
i
had
had
the
temerity
to
cross
the
water
without
a
written
permit
from
a
leader
of
their
band
though
these
men
were
generally
more
or
less
under
the
influence
of
ardent
spirits
after
i
had
explained
myself
as
a
passing
stranger
they
seemed
anxious
to
gain
my
good
opinion
they
told
me
the
story
of
the
dead
city
that
it
had
been
a
notable
manufacturing
and
commercial
mart
sheltering
over
twenty
thousand
persons
that
they
had
waged
war
with
its
inhabitants
for
several
years
and
had
been
finally
successful
only
a
few
days
before
my
visit
in
an
action
fought
in
the
ruined
suburb
after
which
they
had
driven
them
forth
at
the
point
of
the
sword
the
defence
they
said
had
been
obstinate
but
gave
way
on
the
third
day
bombardment
they
also
conducted
me
inside
the
massive
sculptured
walls
of
the
curious
temple
in
which
they
said
the
banished
inhabitants
were
accustomed
to
celebrate
the
mystic
rites
of
an
unhallowed
worship
they
particularly
pointed
out
to
me
certain
features
of
the
building
which
having
been
the
peculiar
objects
of
a
former
superstitious
regard
they
had
as
matter
of
duty
sedulously
defiled
and
defaced
the
reputed
sites
of
certain
shrines
they
had
thus
particularly
noticed
and
various
sheltered
chambers
in
one
of
which
was
a
deep
well
constructed
they
believed
with
a
dreadful
design
besides
these
they
led
me
to
see
a
large
and
deeply
chiselled
marble
vase
or
basin
supported
upon
twelve
oxen
also
of
marble
and
of
life
size
and
of
which
they
told
some
romantic
stories
they
said
the
deluded
persons
most
of
whom
were
emigrants
from
a
great
distance
believed
their
deity
countenanced
their
reception
here
of
a
baptism
of
regeneration
as
proxies
for
whomsoever
they
held
in
warm
affection
in
the
countries
from
which
they
had
come
that
here
parents
went
into
the
water
for
their
lost
children
children
for
their
parents
widows
for
their
spouses
and
young
persons
for
their
lovers
that
thus
the
great
vase
came
to
be
associated
with
all
their
most
cherished
memories
and
was
therefore
the
chief
object
of
all
others
in
the
building
upon
which
they
bestowed
the
greatest
degree
of
their
idolatrous
affection
on
this
account
the
victors
had
so
diligently
desecrated
it
as
to
render
the
apartment
in
which
it
was
contained
too
noisome
to
abide
in
they
permitted
me
also
to
ascend
into
the
steeple
to
see
where
it
had
been
struck
by
lightning
on
the
sabbath
before
and
to
look
out
east
and
south
on
wasted
farms
like
those
i
had
seen
near
the
city
extending
till
they
were
lost
in
the
distance
close
to
the
scar
left
by
the
thunderbolt
were
fragments
of
food
cruses
of
liquor
and
broken
with
a
and
a
steamboat
of
which
with
pain
i
learned
the
use
it
was
after
nightfall
when
i
was
ready
to
cross
the
river
on
my
return
the
wind
had
freshened
since
sunset
and
the
water
beating
roughly
into
my
little
boat
i
headed
higher
up
the
stream
than
the
point
i
had
left
in
the
morning
and
landed
where
a
faint
glimmering
light
invited
me
to
steer
among
the
rushes
sheltered
only
by
the
darkness
without
roof
between
them
and
the
sky
i
came
upon
a
crowd
of
several
hundred
human
creatures
whom
my
movements
roused
from
uneasy
slumber
dreadful
indeed
was
the
suffering
of
these
forsaken
beings
cowed
and
cramped
by
cold
and
sunburn
alternating
as
each
weary
day
and
night
dragged
on
they
were
almost
all
of
them
the
crippled
victims
of
disease
they
were
there
because
they
had
no
homes
nor
hospital
nor
poorhouse
nor
friends
to
offer
them
any
they
could
not
minister
to
the
needs
of
their
sick
they
had
no
bread
to
quiet
the
fractious
hungry
cries
of
their
children
mothers
and
babes
daughters
and
grandparents
all
alike
were
clothed
in
tatters
lacking
even
sufficient
covering
for
the
sufferers
these
were
the
mormons
famishing
in
lee
county
iowa
in
the
fourth
week
of
the
month
of
september
the
deserted
city
was
nauvoo
illinois
the
mormons
were
the
owners
of
that
city
and
the
smiling
country
around
it
and
those
who
had
stopped
their
ploughs
who
had
silenced
their
hammers
their
axes
their
shuttles
and
the
wheels
of
their
workshops
those
who
had
put
out
their
fires
who
had
eaten
their
food
spoiled
their
orchards
and
trampled
under
foot
their
thousands
of
acres
of
unharvested
grain
these
were
the
keepers
of
their
dwellings
the
carousers
in
their
temple
the
noise
of
whose
drunken
rioting
insulted
the
ears
of
the
dying
they
were
all
told
not
more
than
six
hundred
forty
persons
who
were
thus
lying
on
the
but
the
mormons
in
nauvoo
and
its
environs
had
been
numbered
the
year
before
at
over
twenty
thousand
where
were
they
they
had
last
been
seen
carrying
in
mournful
trains
their
sick
and
wounded
halt
and
blind
to
disappear
behind
the
western
horizon
pursuing
the
phantom
of
another
home
hardly
anything
else
was
known
of
them
and
people
asked
with
curiosity
what
had
been
their
fate
what
their
fortunes
the
party
encountered
by
me
at
the
river
shore
were
the
last
of
the
mormons
that
left
the
city
they
had
all
of
them
engaged
the
year
before
that
they
would
vacate
their
homes
and
seek
some
other
place
of
refuge
it
had
been
the
condition
of
a
truce
between
them
and
their
assailants
and
as
an
earnest
of
their
good
faith
the
chief
elders
and
some
others
of
obnoxious
standing
with
their
families
were
to
set
out
for
the
west
in
the
spring
of
it
had
been
stipulated
in
return
that
the
rest
of
the
mormons
might
remain
behind
in
the
peaceful
enjoyment
of
their
illinois
abode
until
their
leaders
with
their
exploring
party
could
with
all
diligence
select
for
them
a
new
place
of
settlement
beyond
the
rocky
mountains
in
california
or
elsewhere
and
until
they
had
opportunity
to
dispose
to
the
best
advantage
of
the
property
which
they
were
then
to
leave
some
renewed
symptoms
of
hostile
feeling
had
however
determined
the
pioneer
party
to
begin
their
work
before
the
spring
it
was
of
course
anticipated
that
this
would
be
a
perilous
service
but
it
was
regarded
as
a
matter
of
duty
the
ardor
and
emulation
of
many
particularly
the
devout
and
the
young
were
stimulated
by
the
difficulties
it
involved
and
the
ranks
of
the
party
were
therefore
filled
up
with
volunteers
from
among
the
most
effective
and
responsible
members
of
the
sect
they
began
their
march
in
midwinter
and
by
the
beginning
of
february
nearly
all
of
them
were
on
the
road
many
of
their
wagons
having
crossed
the
mississippi
on
the
ice
under
the
most
favoring
circumstances
an
expedition
of
this
sort
undertaken
at
such
a
season
of
the
year
could
scarcely
fail
to
be
disastrous
but
the
pioneer
company
had
to
set
out
in
haste
and
were
very
imperfectly
supplied
with
necessaries
the
cold
was
intense
they
moved
in
the
teeth
of
northwest
winds
such
as
sweep
down
the
iowa
peninsula
from
the
icebound
regions
of
the
slave
lake
and
lake
of
the
woods
along
the
scattered
watercourses
where
they
broke
the
thick
ice
to
give
their
cattle
drink
the
annual
autumn
fires
had
left
but
little
firewood
to
men
insufficiently
furnished
with
tents
and
other
appliances
of
shelter
wood
was
almost
a
necessary
of
life
after
days
of
fatigue
their
nights
were
often
passed
in
restless
efforts
to
prevent
themselves
from
freezing
their
stock
of
food
also
proved
inadequate
and
as
their
constitutions
became
more
debilitated
their
suffering
from
cold
increased
afflicted
with
catarrhal
affections
manacled
by
the
fetters
of
dreadfully
acute
rheumatism
some
contrived
for
a
while
to
get
over
the
shortening
day
march
and
drag
along
some
others
but
the
sign
of
an
impaired
circulation
soon
began
to
show
itself
in
the
liability
of
all
to
be
dreadfully
the
hardiest
and
strongest
became
helplessly
crippled
about
the
same
time
the
strength
of
their
draught
animals
began
to
fail
the
small
supply
of
provender
they
could
carry
with
them
had
given
out
the
prairie
straw
proved
devoid
of
nourishment
and
they
could
only
keep
them
from
starving
by
seeking
for
the
browse
as
it
is
called
this
being
the
green
bark
and
tender
buds
and
branches
of
the
cottonwood
and
other
stunted
growths
in
the
hollows
to
return
to
nauvoo
was
apparently
the
only
escape
but
this
would
have
been
to
give
occasion
for
fresh
mistrust
and
so
to
bring
new
trouble
to
those
they
had
left
there
behind
them
they
resolved
at
least
to
hold
their
ground
and
to
advance
as
they
might
were
it
only
by
limping
through
the
deep
snows
a
few
slow
miles
a
day
they
found
a
sort
of
comfort
in
comparing
themselves
to
the
exiles
of
siberia
and
sought
consolation
in
earnest
prayers
for
the
spring
the
spring
came
at
last
it
overtook
them
in
the
sac
and
fox
country
still
on
the
naked
prairie
not
yet
half
way
over
the
trail
they
were
following
between
the
mississippi
and
missouri
rivers
but
it
brought
its
own
share
of
troubles
with
it
the
months
with
which
it
opened
proved
nearly
as
trying
as
the
worst
of
winter
the
snow
and
sleet
and
rain
which
fell
as
it
appeared
to
them
without
intermission
made
the
road
over
the
rich
prairie
soil
as
impassable
as
one
vast
bog
of
heavy
black
mud
sometimes
they
would
fasten
the
horses
and
oxen
of
four
or
five
wagons
to
one
and
attempt
to
get
ahead
in
this
way
taking
turns
but
at
the
close
of
a
day
of
hard
toil
for
themselves
and
their
cattle
they
would
find
themselves
a
quarter
or
a
half
a
mile
from
the
place
they
left
in
the
morning
the
heavy
rains
raised
all
the
watercourses
the
most
trifling
streams
were
impassable
wood
fit
for
bridging
was
often
not
to
be
had
and
in
such
cases
the
only
resource
was
to
halt
for
the
freshets
to
subside
a
matter
in
the
case
of
the
headwaters
of
the
chariton
for
instance
of
over
three
weeks
delay
these
were
dreary
waitings
upon
providence
the
most
spirited
and
sturdy
murmured
most
at
their
forced
inactivity
and
even
the
women
whose
heroic
spirits
had
been
proof
against
the
severest
cold
confessed
their
tempers
fluctuated
with
the
ceaseless
variations
of
the
barometer
they
complained
too
that
the
health
of
their
children
suffered
more
it
was
the
fact
that
the
damp
winds
of
march
and
april
brought
with
them
more
mortal
sickness
than
the
sharpest
freezing
weather
the
frequent
burials
discouraged
and
depressed
the
hardiest
spirits
but
the
general
hopefulness
of
human
nature
was
well
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
even
the
most
provident
were
found
unfurnished
with
burial
necessaries
and
as
a
result
they
were
often
driven
to
the
most
melancholy
makeshifts
the
usual
expedient
adopted
was
to
cut
a
log
of
some
eight
or
nine
feet
long
and
slitting
the
bark
longitudinally
strip
it
off
in
two
these
placed
around
the
body
of
the
deceased
and
bound
firmly
together
with
withs
made
of
alburnum
formed
a
rough
sort
of
tubular
coffin
which
surviving
relatives
and
friends
with
a
little
show
of
black
crape
could
follow
to
the
hole
or
bit
of
ditch
dug
to
receive
it
in
the
wet
ground
of
the
prairie
the
name
of
the
deceased
his
age
the
date
of
his
death
and
the
surrounding
landmarks
were
all
registered
with
care
his
party
was
then
ready
to
move
on
such
graves
mark
all
the
line
of
the
first
years
of
mormon
travel
dispiriting
milestones
to
failing
stragglers
in
the
rear
the
hardships
and
trials
which
they
had
suffered
developed
a
spirit
of
among
these
indomitable
people
hale
young
men
gave
up
their
own
food
and
shelter
to
the
old
and
helpless
and
worked
their
way
back
to
parts
of
the
frontier
states
chiefly
missouri
and
iowa
where
they
were
not
recognized
and
hired
themselves
out
for
wages
to
purchase
more
others
were
sent
there
to
exchange
for
meal
and
flour
or
wheat
and
corn
the
and
other
remaining
articles
of
personal
property
which
a
few
had
still
retained
in
a
kindred
spirit
of
fraternity
others
laid
out
great
farms
in
the
wilds
and
planted
the
grain
saved
for
their
own
bread
that
there
might
be
harvests
for
those
who
should
follow
them
two
of
these
in
the
sac
and
fox
country
and
beyond
it
garden
grove
and
mount
pisgah
included
within
their
fences
about
two
miles
of
land
each
carefully
planted
with
grain
with
a
hamlet
of
comfortable
log
cabins
in
the
neighborhood
of
each
through
all
this
the
pioneers
found
comfort
in
the
thought
that
their
own
suffering
was
the
price
of
immunity
from
similar
hardships
their
friends
at
home
in
following
their
trail
would
otherwise
have
had
to
pay
but
the
arrival
of
spring
proved
this
a
delusion
before
the
warm
weather
had
made
the
earth
dry
enough
for
easy
travel
messengers
came
in
from
nauvoo
to
overtake
the
party
with
tales
of
outrage
and
to
urge
the
chief
men
to
hurry
back
to
the
city
that
they
might
give
counsel
and
assistance
there
the
enemy
had
only
waited
until
the
emigrants
were
supposed
to
be
gone
on
their
road
too
far
to
return
to
interfere
with
them
and
then
renewed
their
aggressions
the
mormons
outside
nauvoo
were
indeed
hard
pressed
but
inside
the
city
they
maintained
themselves
very
well
for
two
or
three
months
longer
strange
to
say
the
chief
part
of
this
respite
was
devoted
to
completing
the
structure
of
their
quaintly
devised
but
beautiful
temple
since
the
dispersion
of
jewry
probably
history
affords
us
no
parallel
to
the
attachment
of
the
mormons
for
this
edifice
every
architectural
element
every
most
fantastic
emblem
it
embodied
was
associated
for
them
with
some
cherished
feature
of
their
religion
its
erection
had
been
enjoined
upon
them
as
a
most
sacred
duty
they
were
proud
of
the
honor
it
conferred
upon
their
city
when
it
grew
up
in
its
splendor
to
become
the
chief
object
of
the
admiration
of
strangers
upon
the
upper
mississippi
besides
they
had
built
it
as
a
labor
of
love
they
could
count
up
to
half
a
million
the
value
of
their
tithings
and
freewill
offerings
laid
upon
it
hardly
a
mormon
woman
had
not
given
up
to
it
some
trinket
or
the
poorest
mormon
man
had
at
least
served
the
tenth
part
of
his
year
on
its
walls
and
the
coarsest
artisan
could
turn
to
it
with
something
of
the
ennobling
attachment
an
artist
has
for
his
own
creation
therefore
though
their
enemies
drove
on
them
ruthlessly
they
succeeded
in
parrying
the
last
till
they
had
completed
even
the
gilding
of
the
angel
and
trumpet
on
the
summit
of
its
lofty
spire
as
a
closing
work
they
placed
on
the
entablature
of
the
front
like
a
baptismal
mark
on
the
forehead
these
words
the
house
of
the
lord
built
by
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
holiness
to
the
lord
then
at
high
noon
under
the
bright
sunshine
of
may
the
next
after
its
completion
they
consecrated
it
to
divine
service
there
was
a
carefully
studied
ceremonial
for
the
occasion
it
was
said
the
high
elders
of
the
sect
travelled
furtively
from
the
camp
of
israel
in
the
wilderness
and
throwing
off
ingenious
disguises
appeared
in
their
own
robes
of
office
to
give
it
splendor
for
that
one
day
the
temple
stood
resplendent
in
all
its
typical
glories
of
sun
moon
and
stars
and
other
abounding
figured
and
lettered
signs
hieroglyphs
and
symbols
but
that
day
only
the
sacred
rites
of
consecration
ended
the
work
of
removing
the
proceeded
with
the
rapidity
of
magic
it
went
on
through
the
night
and
when
the
morning
of
the
next
day
dawned
all
the
ornaments
and
furniture
everything
that
could
provoke
a
sneer
had
been
carried
off
and
except
some
fixtures
that
would
not
bear
removal
the
building
was
dismantled
this
day
saw
the
departure
of
the
last
of
the
elders
and
the
largest
band
that
moved
in
one
company
together
the
people
of
iowa
have
told
me
that
from
morning
to
night
they
passed
westward
like
an
endless
procession
they
did
not
seem
greatly
out
of
heart
they
said
but
at
the
top
of
every
hill
before
they
disappeared
they
were
to
be
seen
looking
back
like
banished
moors
on
their
abandoned
homes
and
the
distant
temple
and
its
glittering
spire
after
this
consecration
which
was
construed
to
indicate
an
insincerity
on
the
part
of
the
mormons
as
to
their
stipulated
departure
or
at
least
a
hope
of
return
their
foes
set
upon
them
with
renewed
bitterness
as
many
fled
as
were
at
all
prepared
but
by
the
very
fact
of
their
so
decreasing
the
already
diminished
forces
of
the
city
defenders
they
encouraged
the
enemy
to
greater
boldness
it
soon
became
apparent
that
nothing
short
of
an
immediate
emigration
could
save
the
remnant
from
this
time
onward
the
energies
of
those
already
on
the
road
were
engrossed
by
the
duty
of
providing
for
the
fugitives
who
came
crowding
in
after
them
at
a
last
general
meeting
of
the
sect
in
nauvoo
there
had
been
passed
a
unanimous
resolution
that
they
would
sustain
one
another
whatever
their
circumstances
upon
the
march
and
this
though
made
in
view
of
no
such
appalling
exigency
they
now
with
one
accord
set
themselves
together
to
carry
out
the
host
again
moved
on
the
tents
which
had
gathered
on
the
hill
summits
like
white
birds
hesitating
to
venture
on
the
long
flight
over
the
river
were
struck
one
after
another
and
the
dwellers
in
them
and
their
wagons
and
their
cattle
hastened
down
to
cross
it
at
a
ferry
in
the
valley
which
they
made
by
night
and
day
a
little
beyond
the
landing
they
formed
their
companies
and
made
their
preparations
for
the
last
and
longest
stage
of
their
journey
though
the
season
was
late
when
they
first
crossed
the
missouri
some
of
them
moved
forward
with
great
hopefulness
full
of
the
notion
of
viewing
and
choosing
their
new
homes
that
year
but
the
van
had
only
reached
grand
island
and
the
pawnee
villages
when
they
were
overtaken
by
more
ill
news
from
nauvoo
before
the
summer
closed
their
enemies
set
upon
the
last
remnant
of
those
who
were
left
behind
in
illinois
they
were
a
few
lingerers
who
could
not
be
persuaded
but
there
might
yet
be
time
for
them
to
gather
up
their
worldly
goods
before
removing
some
weakly
mothers
and
their
infants
a
few
delicate
young
girls
and
many
cripples
and
bereaved
and
sick
people
these
had
remained
under
shelter
according
to
the
mormon
statement
at
least
by
virtue
of
an
express
covenant
in
their
behalf
if
there
was
such
a
covenant
it
was
broken
a
vindictive
war
was
waged
upon
them
from
which
the
weakest
fled
in
scattered
parties
leaving
the
rest
to
make
a
reluctant
and
almost
ludicrously
unavailing
defence
till
september
when
one
thousand
six
hundred
troops
entered
nauvoo
and
drove
all
forth
who
had
not
retreated
before
that
time
like
the
wounded
birds
of
a
flock
fired
into
toward
nightfall
they
came
straggling
on
with
faltering
steps
many
of
them
without
bag
or
baggage
beast
or
barrow
all
asking
shelter
or
burial
and
forcing
a
fresh
repartition
of
the
already
divided
rations
of
their
friends
it
was
plain
now
that
every
energy
must
be
taxed
to
prevent
the
entire
expedition
from
perishing
further
emigration
for
the
time
was
out
of
the
question
and
the
whole
people
prepared
themselves
for
encountering
another
winter
on
the
prairie
happily
for
the
main
body
they
found
themselves
at
this
juncture
among
indians
who
were
amicably
disposed
the
lands
on
both
sides
of
the
missouri
in
particular
were
owned
by
the
pottawottomis
and
omahas
two
tribes
whom
unjust
treatment
by
our
united
states
government
had
the
effect
of
rendering
most
hospitable
to
strangers
whom
they
regarded
as
persecuted
like
themselves
they
were
pleased
with
the
mormons
they
would
have
been
pleased
with
any
whites
who
would
not
cheat
them
nor
sell
them
whiskey
nor
whip
them
for
their
poor
gypsy
habits
nor
conduct
themselves
indecently
toward
their
women
many
of
whom
among
the
pottawottomis
especially
those
of
nearly
unmixed
french
descent
are
singularly
comely
and
some
of
them
educated
but
all
indians
have
something
like
a
sentiment
of
reverence
for
the
insane
and
admire
those
who
sacrifice
without
apparent
motive
their
worldly
welfare
to
the
triumph
of
an
idea
they
understand
the
meaning
of
what
they
call
a
great
vow
and
think
it
the
duty
of
the
to
lighten
the
votary
penance
under
it
to
this
feeling
they
united
the
sympathy
of
for
those
who
could
talk
to
them
of
their
own
illinois
and
tell
the
story
of
how
they
also
had
been
ruthlessly
expelled
from
it
their
hospitality
was
sincere
almost
delicate
fanny
le
clerc
the
spoiled
child
of
the
great
brave
pied
riche
interpreter
of
the
nation
would
have
the
paleface
miss
devine
learn
duets
with
her
on
the
guitar
and
the
daughter
of
substantial
joseph
la
framboise
the
united
states
interpreter
for
the
tribe
she
died
of
the
fever
that
summer
welcomed
all
the
nicest
young
mormon
women
to
a
party
at
her
father
house
which
was
probably
the
best
cabin
in
that
village
they
made
the
mormons
at
home
there
and
elsewhere
upon
all
their
lands
they
formally
gave
them
leave
to
remain
as
long
as
suited
their
own
good
pleasure
the
affair
of
course
furnished
material
for
a
solemn
council
under
the
auspices
of
an
officer
of
the
united
states
their
chiefs
were
summoned
in
the
form
befitting
great
occasions
to
meet
in
the
yard
of
a
sarpy
log
they
came
in
grand
costume
moving
in
their
fantastic
attire
with
so
much
and
genteel
measure
that
the
stranger
found
it
difficult
not
to
believe
them
gentlemen
attending
a
ball
their
aristocratically
thin
legs
of
which
they
displayed
fully
the
usual
indian
proportion
aided
this
illusion
there
is
something
too
at
all
times
very
in
the
theatrical
french
millinery
tie
of
the
pottawottomi
turban
while
it
is
next
to
impossible
for
a
sober
white
man
at
first
sight
to
believe
that
the
red
green
black
blue
and
yellow
cosmetics
with
which
he
sees
such
grave
personages
so
variously
dotted
diapered
cancelled
and
arabesqued
are
worn
by
them
in
any
mood
but
one
of
the
deepest
and
most
desperate
quizzing
from
the
time
of
their
first
squat
upon
the
ground
to
the
final
breaking
up
of
the
council
circle
they
sustained
their
characters
with
equal
and
address
i
will
not
take
it
upon
myself
to
describe
their
order
of
ceremonies
indeed
i
ought
not
since
i
have
never
been
able
to
view
the
habits
and
customs
of
our
aborigines
in
any
other
light
than
that
of
a
sorrowful
subject
of
jest
besides
in
this
instance
the
powwow
and
the
expected
flow
of
turgid
eloquence
were
both
moderated
probably
by
the
conduct
of
the
entire
transaction
on
temperance
principles
i
therefore
content
myself
with
observing
generally
that
the
proceedings
were
such
as
in
every
way
became
the
dignity
of
the
parties
interested
and
the
magnitude
of
the
interests
involved
when
the
red
men
had
indulged
to
satiety
in
from
their
and
in
what
they
love
still
better
their
peculiar
metaphoric
rhodomontade
which
beginning
with
the
celestial
bodies
and
coursing
downward
over
the
grandest
sublunary
objects
always
managed
to
alight
at
last
on
their
great
father
polk
and
the
tenderness
with
which
his
affectionate
red
children
regarded
him
all
the
solemn
funny
fellows
present
who
played
the
part
of
chiefs
signed
formal
articles
of
convention
with
their
unpronounceable
names
the
renowned
chief
pied
riche
he
was
surnamed
le
clerc
on
account
of
his
remarkable
scholarship
then
rose
and
said
my
mormon
brethren
the
pottawottomi
came
sad
and
tired
into
this
unhealthy
missouri
bottom
not
many
years
back
when
he
was
taken
from
his
beautiful
country
beyond
the
mississippi
which
had
abundant
game
and
timber
and
clear
water
everywhere
now
you
are
driven
away
the
same
from
your
lodges
and
lands
and
the
graves
of
your
people
so
we
have
both
suffered
we
must
help
one
another
and
the
great
spirit
will
help
us
both
you
are
now
free
to
cut
and
use
all
the
wood
you
may
wish
you
can
make
all
your
improvements
and
live
on
any
part
of
our
actual
land
not
occupied
by
us
because
one
suffers
and
does
not
deserve
it
is
no
reason
he
shall
suffer
always
i
say
we
may
live
to
see
all
right
yet
however
if
we
do
not
our
children
will
jour
and
thus
ended
the
powwow
i
give
this
speech
as
a
morsel
of
real
indian
it
was
recited
to
me
after
the
treaty
by
the
pottawottomi
orator
in
french
which
language
he
spoke
with
elegance
good
day
is
the
french
indian
and
english
hail
and
farewell
of
the
pottawottomis
upon
the
pottawotomi
lands
scattered
through
the
border
regions
of
missouri
and
iowa
in
the
sac
and
fox
country
a
few
among
the
ioways
among
the
poncas
in
a
great
company
upon
the
banks
of
the
qui
coulée
or
running
water
river
and
at
the
omaha
winter
quarters
the
mormons
sustained
themselves
through
the
heavy
winter
of
it
was
the
severest
of
their
trials
this
winter
was
the
of
the
mormon
fortunes
those
who
lived
through
it
were
spared
to
witness
the
gradual
return
of
better
times
and
they
now
liken
it
to
the
passing
of
a
dreary
night
since
which
they
have
watched
the
coming
of
a
steadily
brightening
day
in
the
spring
of
a
body
of
one
hundred
picked
men
with
seventy
wagons
drawn
by
their
best
horses
left
the
omaha
quarters
under
the
command
of
the
members
of
the
high
council
who
had
wintered
there
they
carried
with
them
little
but
seed
and
farming
implements
their
aim
being
to
plant
spring
crops
at
their
ultimate
destination
they
relied
on
their
rifles
to
give
them
food
but
rarely
left
their
road
in
search
of
game
they
made
long
marches
and
moved
as
rapidly
as
possible
against
the
season
when
ordinary
emigration
passes
the
missouri
they
were
already
through
the
south
pass
and
after
a
couple
of
short
travel
beyond
it
entered
upon
the
more
arduous
part
of
their
journey
which
now
lay
through
the
rocky
mountains
they
passed
fremont
peak
long
peak
the
twins
and
other
summits
but
had
great
difficulties
to
overcome
in
forcing
their
way
over
other
mountains
of
the
rugged
utah
range
sometimes
following
the
stony
bed
of
torrents
the
headwaters
of
some
of
the
mightiest
rivers
of
our
continent
and
sometimes
literally
cutting
their
road
through
heavy
and
ragged
timber
they
arrived
at
the
grand
basin
of
the
great
salt
lake
much
exhausted
but
without
losing
a
man
and
in
time
to
plant
for
a
partial
autumn
harvest
another
party
started
after
these
pioneers
from
the
omaha
winter
quarters
in
the
summer
they
had
five
hundred
wagons
and
carried
large
quantities
of
grain
which
they
were
able
to
sow
before
it
froze
the
same
season
these
were
joined
by
a
part
of
the
battalion
and
other
members
of
the
church
who
came
eastward
from
california
and
the
sandwich
islands
together
they
fortified
themselves
strongly
with
brick
walls
and
blockhouses
and
living
safely
through
the
winter
were
able
to
reap
crops
that
yielded
ample
provision
for
the
ensuing
year
in
nearly
all
the
remaining
members
of
the
church
left
the
missouri
country
in
a
succession
of
powerful
bands
invigorated
and
enriched
by
their
abundant
harvests
there
and
that
year
saw
fully
established
their
commonwealth
of
the
new
covenant
the
future
state
of
deseret
footnote
the
mormons
repeatedly
tried
to
secure
the
admission
of
deseret
into
the
union
as
a
state
under
that
name
said
to
mean
virtue
and
industry
when
utah
was
organized
as
a
territory
the
mormon
leader
brigham
young
was
made
governor
in
president
buchanan
appointed
a
to
succeed
young
this
act
led
the
mormons
to
rebel
but
after
a
display
of
military
force
by
the
government
they
acknowledged
allegiance
in
polygamy
having
been
prohibited
by
congress
utah
was
admitted
to
the
union
since
the
settlement
of
the
mormons
upon
the
great
salt
lake
there
has
been
a
large
immigration
into
utah
the
mormons
have
spread

that
state

other
parts
of

west
and
southwest
ed
the
reforms
of
pius
ix
francis
bowen
in
the
long
roll
of
pontiffs
the
name
of
pius
ix
stands
conspicuous
among
those
of
popes
who
have
greatly
exerted
their
power
for
effect
upon
the
papacy
itself
but
the
influence
of
pius
ix
was
not
less
marked
in
italian
and
european
politics
an
account
of
the
reforms
which
he
undertook
and
of
the
obstacles
he
had
to
confront
can
not
fail
to
convey
directly
or
by
implication
matters
of
much
importance
in
modern
history
that
a
pope
who
signalized
the
beginning
of
his
official
career
by
a
series
of
liberal
reforms
should
soon
have
been
driven
from
his
see
by
revolutionists
is
one
of
the
historical
paradoxes
for
which
even
the
philosophy
of
history
finds
it
difficult
to
account
but
as
one
writer
tells
us
the
revolutionary
fever
of
spread
too
fast
for
a
reforming
pope
and
his
refusal
to
make
war
upon
the
austrians
finally
cost
him
the
affections
of
the
romans
pope
pius
ix
giovanni
maria

who
at
the
age
of

his
early
education
was
received
at
the
college
of
volterra
throughout
the
years
of
his
youth
he
suffered
from
infirm
health
but
before
reaching
thirty
he
gained
much
in
strength
and
in
became
archbishop
of
spoleto
in
he
was
made
cardinal
by
pope
gregory
xvi
gregory
died
june
and
after
being
two
days
in
conclave
the
cardinals
elected
their
colleague
ferretti
to
succeed
him
the
cardinals
felt
the
advisability
of
choosing
for
pope
a
native
of
the
papal
states
a
man
not
too
far
advanced
in
years
and
one
who
would
see
the
necessity
of
correcting
abuses
and
making
some
reforms
francis
bowen
whose
review
of
pope
pius
career
from
his
entrance
upon
the
papal
office
until
his
temporary
withdrawal
from
rome
is
here
presented
is
a
authority
in
this
as
also
in
other
fields
of
history
and
his
recital
is
based
upon
the
best
contemporary
accounts
when
pius
ix
was
elected
pope
his
course
did
not
long
remain
doubtful
he
limited
the
expenses
of
the
court
at
once
dispensed
alms
in
abundance
set
aside
one
day
of
each
week
for
giving
audiences
and
commanded
that
political
inquisitions
should
be
stopped
immediately
these
few
steps
taken
before
he
had
had
time
to
consult
with
others
afford
perhaps
a
better
indication
of
the
mild
and
kind
character
of
the
new
pontiff
than
the
grave
political
acts
which
were
subsequently
performed
these
show
us
the
man
the
others
reveal
only
the
sovereign
just
one
month
after
his
election
a
manifesto
of
amnesty
for
all
political
offenders
was
published
at
rome
including
the
exiles
those
awaiting
trial
and
those
undergoing
sentence
the
only
conditions
imposed
were
that
the
individuals
pardoned
should
give
their
word
of
honor
never
to
abuse
the
indulgence
and
would
fulfil
every
duty
of
a
good
citizen
the
news
of
this
act
flew
like
the
wind
through
the
papal
states
and
caused
everywhere
a
burst
of
exultation
and
gratitude
toward
the
new
sovereign
it
carried
joy
to
thousands
of
households
bringing
back
to
them
the
brother
or
parent
and
it
was
a
token
of
future
peace
and
contentment
in
the
city
says
farini
footnote
luigi
carlo
farini
who
is
freely
quoted
by
bowen
was
an
italian
historian
and
statesman
his
principal
work
is
dello
stato
romano
dall
anno
al
ed
the
hosannas
were
countless
each
citizen
embraced
his
neighbor
like
a
brother
thousands
of
torches
blazed
in
the
evening
the
multitude
ran
to
the
palace
of
the
pope
called
for
him
threw
themselves
prostrate
on
the
earth
before
him
and
received
his
blessing
in
devout
silence
many
of
the
pardoned
offenders
were
still
more
extravagant
in
their
demonstrations
of
joy
and
thankfulness
among
them
was
galletti
of
bologna
afterward
one
of
the
pope
ministers
and
most
active
in
those
measures
which
ended
in
the
assassination
of
rossi
and
in
driving
pius
into
exile
he
had
been
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
life
and
was
kept
in
the
castle
of
sant
angelo
when
released
he
threw
himself
at
the
pope
feet
and
swore
by
his
own
heart
blood
and
that
of
his
children
that
he
would
be
grateful
and
faithful
some
of
the
exiles
however
among
whom
was
mamiani
refused
to
subscribe
the
proposed
engagement
simple
as
it
was
but
they
returned
after
a
time
to
their
homes
merely
promising
allegiance
every
time
that
the
pope
left
his
palace
he
was
surrounded
by
a
sort
of
triumphal
procession
the
whole
length
of
the
corso
was
decorated
when
he
passed
through
it
and
hundreds
of
likenesses
of
him
and
of
panegyrical
compositions
covered
the
walls
foremost
in
getting
up
these
popular
celebrations
was
angelo
brunetti
afterward
so
well
known
by
his
nickname
of
ciceruacchio
he
was
a
person
of
single
mind
rustic
in
manners
proud
and
at
the
same
time
generous
as
is
common
with
romans
of
the
lower
class
by
his
industry
he
had
acquired
considerable
property
and
by
his
liberal
use
of
it
had
become
a
leader
of
the
populace
whom
he
now
fired
with
his
own
enthusiasm
for
pius
ix
the
pope
would
have
been
more
than
man
if
his
head
had
not
been
a
little
turned
with
all
this
adulation
which
came
to
him
from
many
foreign
lands
as
well
as
from
italy
but
his
simple
and
modest
character
bore
the
trial
well
he
manifested
no
undue
elation
and
formed
his
plans
tranquilly
and
without
hurry
for
the
improvement
of
his
people
cardinal
gizzi
well
known
as
a
friend
to
reform
and
much
attached
to
the
pope
was
named
secretary
of
state
and
he
wrote
letters
to
the
presidents
of
the
provinces
inviting
them
the
municipal
magistrates
ecclesiastics
and
all
respectable
citizens
to
prepare
and
offer
schemes
for
promoting
popular
education
and
especially
for
the
moral
religious
and
industrial
instruction
of
the
children
of
the
poor
commissions
were
appointed
to
deliberate
and
advise
upon
many
subjects
of
proposed
reform
great
indeed
was
the
need
of
change
in
the
institutions
of
the
pontifical
states
but
the
government
had
a
delicate
part
to
play
in
amending
them
and
it
wisely
determined
not
to
be
precipitate
in
its
measures
already
the
liberals
had
conceived
boundless
desires
and
the
retrogradists
were
haunted
with
unreasonable
fears
the
government
had
to
moderate
on
the
left
circulate
despatches
wellnigh
to
scold
men
for
hoping
too
much
but
the
friends
of
change
says
farini
were
for
the
most
part
measured
in
their
wishes
and
cautious
in
their
proceedings
for
all
prudent
men
were
exerting
themselves
strenuously
to
keep
the
impatient
in
hand
with
excellent
effect
we
can
not
follow
in
detail
the
pope
measures
down
to
march
till
which
period
the
movement
may
be
considered
as
all
his
own
emanating
from
his
free
choice
and
not
from
the
pressure
of
outward
circumstances
or
from
revolutions
in
foreign
states
he
did
enough
during
these
twenty
months
to
establish
his
character
as
a
wise
humane
and
liberal
sovereign
eager
to
promote
the
temporal
and
religious
interests
of
his
people
and
prompt
to
give
political
power
into
their
hands
as
fast
as
they
showed
themselves
capable
of
using
and
not
abusing
it
he
instituted
a
civic
guard
throughout
his
dominions
modelled
on
the
french
national
guard
and
disbanded
the
gregorian
centurions
and
volunteers
all
his
court
was
opposed
to
this
measure
as
premature
and
dangerous
and
even
cardinal
gizzi
resigned
his
place
in
consequence
of
it
but
the
pope
persevered
and
cardinal
ferretti
still
more
inclined
to
liberalism
was
appointed
in
his
place
he
conceived
the
idea
of
an
italian
customs
league
after
the
model
of
the
german
one
and
pressed
it
with
so
much
earnestness
that
in
november
it
was
instituted
for
the
roman
tuscan
and
sardinian
dominions
and
every
effort
was
made
to
render
it
acceptable
to
the
other
powers
of
italy
he
established
a
municipal
government
for
the
city
of
rome
which
had
hitherto
remained
without
one
and
he
created
a
council
of
state
for
all
his
dominions
to
consist
chiefly
of
the
laity
one
person
being
chosen
for
each
province
by
the
sovereign
out
of
a
list
of
three
nominated
by
the
provincial
authorities
this
council
was
to
sit
in
rome
and
aid
the
government
with
its
advice
in
putting
the
various
departments
in
order
in
constituting
municipalities
and
in
other
public
concerns
he
created
also
a
council
of
ministers
which
farini
calls
the
most
important
act
of
his
reign
as
being
that
by
which
the
executive
power
acquired
an
organization
worthy
of
a
civilized
state
and
altogether
novel
in
that
of
rome
there
were
to
be
nine
departments
and
with
the
exception
of
the
president
of
the
council
and
its
secretary
the
ministers
need
not
be
cardinals
all
those
first
appointed
however
were
cardinals
or
prelates
a
body
of
was
attached
to
this
council
consisting
of
twelve
ecclesiastics
and
twelve
laymen
all
appointed
by
the
sovereign
the
laws
respecting
the
censorship
of
the
press
were
much
relaxed
and
numerous
political
journals
were
established
at
rome
which
before
had
nothing
that
deserved
the
name
of
a
newspaper
our
infant
journalism
says
farini
had
its
infant
passions
and
caprices
instead
of
meditating
it
gambolled
and
every
day
it
smashed
its
toys
of
the
day
before
as
children
do
it
instituted
a
school
of
declamation
not
of
political
knowledge
it
ran
and
plunged
about
blindfold
it
made
boast
of
an
independent
spirit
and
was
a
mean
slave
to
influence
these
measures
of
reform
and
the
enthusiasm
which
they
created
were
not
without
effect
on
surrounding
nations
considering
the
place
whence
they
came
and
the
sovereign
who
conducted
them
they
were
adapted
to
have
a
vast
influence
rome
the
eternal
city
was
regenerated
and
a
new
life
bounded
through
her
old
limbs
and
the
august
head
of
the
catholic
church
the
greatest
religious
potentate
of
the
civilized
world
the
infallible
the
object
of
veneration
to
half
christendom
and
hitherto
the
most
despotic
and
conservative
sovereign
in
europe
was
now
the
daring
innovator
the
radical
the
idol
of
the
populace
austria
looked
on
with
distrust
and
dismay
and
tried
to
pick
a
quarrel
and
thus
find
a
pretext
for
invasion
by
ordering
its
troops
who
had
as
yet
only
garrisoned
the
fortress
to
occupy
the
city
of
ferrara
and
patrol
its
streets
a
measure
almost
sure
to
lead
to
a
collision
with
its
citizens
the
pope
protested
in
a
firm
but
temperate
tone
and
his
indignant
people
would
fain
have
hurried
him
into
a
war
but
he
bridled
their
impatience
and
the
matter
ended
in
a
compromise
tuscany
caught
the
generous
flame
of
freedom
and
though
there
was
not
so
much
to
be
accomplished
there
as
the
government
had
long
been
mild
and
discreet
the
good
archduke
leopold
ii
professed
the
utmost
admiration
for
pius
and
began
to
imitate
his
measures
the
king
of
sardinia
was
moved
to
enthusiasm
during
the
difficulty
with
austria
about
ferrara
he
offered
the
pope
whatever
succor
of
ships
or
men
he
might
need
and
an
asylum
in
his
dominions
if
he
should
be
compelled
to
leave
rome
he
did
more
he
relaxed
the
bonds
of
the
press
improved
the
administration
of
justice
deprived
the
police
of
their
discretionary
power
enlarged
and
amended
the
council
of
state
emancipated
the
communes
and
allowed
their
officers
to
be
chosen
by
popular
vote
the
character
and
example
of
pius
seemed
likely
to
effect
as
great
and
as
beneficial
changes
out
of
his
dominions
as
within
them
those
of
the
italian
sovereigns
who
were
not
willing
to
follow
his
lead
of
their
own
accord
were
obliged
to
yield
in
dismay
before
the
spirit
which
he
had
awakened
in
their
subjects
the
silly
duke
of
lucca
a
fanatic
a
prodigal
and
a
despot
after
attempting
in
vain
to
cudgel
his
people
into
submission
fled
in
terror
from
their
aroused
wrath
and
consented
to
the
annexation
of
his
dominions
to
tuscany
whereby
they
shared
in
the
reforms
instituted
by
leopold
but
in
sicily
and
naples
were
developed
the
most
striking
results
of
the
fire
which
had
been
kindled
by
a
reforming
pope
the
cruel
and
imbecile
bourbon
who
reigned
there
became
only
more
harsh
and
obstinate
while
the
other
princes
of
italy
deemed
it
necessary
to
reform
their
institutions
and
conciliate
their
people
his
subjects
petitioned
him
and
shouted
for
pius
in
the
streets
but
the
soldiery
were
turned
against
them
and
the
king
showed
himself
alike
inaccessible
to
their
caresses
and
their
prayers
one
king
only
said
thiers
from
the
tribune
speaking
of
italy
he
of
naples
presented
the
sword
point
to
the
people
who
were
flocking
around
him
and
that
people
fell
on
it
the
impulsive
sicilians
fixed
january
as
the
day
beyond
which
their
patience
would
not
extend
the
king
made
no
concessions
the
day
came
and
the
island
was
revolutionized
the
troops
everywhere
giving
way
before
the
excited
populace
within
a
fortnight
the
inhabitants
of
naples
followed
their
example
and
before
the
fight
began
the
heart
failed
him
and
he
granted
all
that
they
asked
the
ministry
was
changed
a
constitution
was
resolved
upon
and
its
fundamental
principles
were
announced
on
january
while
the
administration
pledged
themselves
to
publish
it
complete
within
twelve
days
the
king
came
out
to
meet
the
crowd
who
were
cheering
him
and
intimated
his
purpose
to
surpass
the
other
sovereigns
of
italy
in
the
magnitude
of
his
concessions
how
sincere
his
promises
were
the
lapse
of
a
few
months
fully
showed
but
at
present
everything
wore
a
cheerful
aspect
the
pope
had
now
reached
the
climax
of
his
fortunes
the
furthest
limit
of
the
good
which
he
was
permitted
to
accomplish
by
his
own
free
will
and
the
sky
began
to
be
overcast
the
enthusiasm
of
his
people
became
unmanageable
and
the
volcanic
force
of
another
french
revolution
was
soon
to
burst
and
to
prostrate
half
the
governments
in
europe
by
the
explosion
constant
excitement
for
twenty
months
had
made
rome
noisy
and
turbulent
and
the
populace
had
been
gratified
so
often
that
they
now
expected
everything
to
succumb
to
their
wishes
busy
agitators
were
in
the
midst
of
them
intent
upon
prosecuting
the
plans
of
mazzini
and
young
italy
and
turning
reform
into
revolution
the
people
were
mad
for
a
declaration
of
war
against
austria
though
the
military
strength
of
the
roman
states
was
grossly
inadequate
for
such
a
conflict
and
the
head
of
the
catholic
church
was
naturally
reluctant
to
come
to
extremities
with
a
catholic
power
which
had
long
been
the
firmest
support
of
the
papacy
then
a
cry
was
raised
to
exclude
all
ecclesiastics
from
office
or
at
least
to
admit
so
large
a
portion
of
the
laity
into
the
administration
that
rome
would
be
secularized
and
lose
its
distinctive
character
as
an
appanage
for
the
head
of
the
church
the
people
would
not
consider
or
were
reckless
of
the
fact
that
pius
was
a
devout
catholic
as
well
as
a
liberal
sovereign
and
could
not
be
expected
to
lend
his
aid
to
a
project
for
stripping
the
papacy
of
all
temporal
power
if
not
for
razing
it
to
its
foundations
the
cries
of
expulsion
and
death
to
the
jesuits
were
also
raised
and
as
that
body
however
obnoxious
elsewhere
had
given
no
offence
at
rome
the
pope
sense
of
justice
inclined
him
to
protect
them
and
to
resist
the
clamor
of
the
mob
the
news
from
sicily
and
naples
caused
a
great
popular
demonstration
at
rome
the
aspect
of
which
was
so
threatening
that
pius
issued
a
proclamation
on
february
announcing
that
he
had
taken
measures
for
reorganizing
and
enlarging
the
army
and
for
augmenting
the
lay
portion
of
the
council
of
ministers
but
appealing
to
his
people
in
affecting
terms
by
the
proofs
already
given
of
his
solicitude
in
their
behalf
that
they
should
cease
from
agitation
and
not
make
demands
which
could
not
be
granted
consistently
with
his
duty
and
their
own
this
paper
caused
another
effusion
of
popular
gratitude
an
immense
multitude
collected
in
the
piazza
del
papolo
and
accompanied
by
the
civic
guard
and
bearing
banners
they
set
out
for
the
palace
when
they
came
to
the
quirinal
pius
showed
himself
at
the
balcony
and
made
signs
that
he
wished
to
speak
there
was
a
profound
silence
not
broken
even
by
the
trickling
of
the
fountains
which
had
been
stopped
some
days
before
the
pope
said
the
benediction
of
god
descends
upon
you
on
the
rest
of
my
people
and
i
say
it
again
on
all
italy
i
pray
you
to
be
of
one
mind
and
to
keep
the
faith
which
you
have
sworn
to
me
the
pontiff
at
these
words
the
silence
of
deep
feeling
was
broken
by
a
sudden
thunder
of
acclamation
i
swear
and
pius
proceeded
warn
you
however
against
the
raising
of
certain
cries
that
are
not
of
the
people
but
of
a
few
individuals
and
against
making
any
such
requests
to
me
as
are
incompatible
with
the
sanctity
of
the
church
for
these
i
can
not
i
may
not
and
i
will
not
grant
this
being
understood
with
my
whole
soul
i
bless
you
deeds
followed
words
the
ministry
was
changed
five
laymen
were
admitted
into
it
and
it
was
intimated
that
a
constitution
would
be
granted
resembling
those
in
other
states
then
came
the
news
of
the
disasters
at
paris
and
everything
was
precipitated
on
march
the
ministry
was
again
changed
only
three
ecclesiastics
being
now
admitted
into
it
and
on
the
the
new
constitution
or
fundamental
statute
was
proclaimed
it
instituted
a
legislature
in
two
branches
the
high
council
and
the
council
of
deputies
the
members
of
the
former
being
appointed
by
the
pope
and
those
of
the
latter
being
chosen
by
popular
vote
in
the
ratio
as
nearly
as
might
be
of
one
to
every
thirty
thousand
souls
all
citizens
were
voters
who
paid
twelve
crowns
a
year
in
direct
taxes
or
had
property
amounting
to
three
hundred
crowns
to
these
were
added
all
members
of
colleges
and
honorary
graduates
and
all
persons
holding
office
in
the
communes
and
municipalities
the
legislature
was
to
be
convoked
every
year
both
councils
were
to
choose
their
own
officers
and
their
sessions
were
to
be
public
except
on
extraordinary
occasions
when
they
might
of
their
own
accord
prefer
secrecy
freedom
of
debate
and
vote
was
guaranteed
and
the
members
of
both
houses
were
protected
from
arrest
even
for
notoriously
criminal
acts
during
the
session
except
by
consent
of
the
council
to
which
they
belonged
they
were
to
have
authority
to
make
laws
on
all
subjects
excepting
ecclesiastical
matters
and
the
canons
and
discipline
of
the
church
but
including
the
imposition
of
taxes
the
pope
however
like
most
monarchs
reserved
to
himself
the
right
of
negativing
a
law
all
discussions
also
of
the
relations
of
the
holy
see
with
foreign
powers
were
forbidden
money
bills
were
to
originate
in
the
lower
house
and
direct
taxes
could
be
granted
for
only
a
year
the
deputies
had
a
right
to
impeach
ministers
who
if
they
were
laymen
were
to
be
tried
by
the
high
council
if
ecclesiastics
by
the
sacred
college
the
unlimited
right
of
petition
to
the
lower
house
was
assured
and
ministers
were
responsible
for
every
ministerial
act
they
had
the
right
of
sitting
and
debating
but
not
of
voting
in
both
councils
a
portion
of
the
revenue
of
the
state
for
the
support
of
the
cardinals
the
ecclesiastical
congregations
and
generally
for
the
transaction
of
purely
ecclesiastical
business
was
to
be
secured
to
the
pope
and
to
be
borne
on
the
estimates
every
year
the
judges
were
to
be
irremovable
after
they
had
held
office
for
three
years
and
all
persons
were
declared
equal
in
the
sight
of
the
law
extraordinary
commissions
or
tribunals
for
the
trial
of
offences
were
abolished
all
property
whether
of
individuals
or
corporations
whether
civil
or
ecclesiastical
was
to
be
held
subject
to
its
equal
part
of
the
burdens
of
the
state
and
to
all
bills
imposing
taxes
the
pope
would
annex
of
his
own
authority
a
special
waiver
of
the
ecclesiastical
exemption
the
administrations
of
the
provinces
and
the
communes
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
their
respective
inhabitants
the
government
or
political
censorship
was
abolished
but
the
ecclesiastical
censorship
was
retained
such
is
a
general
outline
of
the
roman
constitution
spontaneously
granted
to
his
subjects
by
pius
ix
its
merits
in
all
civil
or
political
matters
are
certainly
equal
if
not
superior
to
those
of
the
english
constitution
from
which
in
great
part
it
was
borrowed
its
faults
are
precisely
those
which
resulted
necessarily
from
the
double
character
as
temporal
sovereign
of
the
roman
states
and
as
head
of
the
catholic
church
throughout
the
world
it
was
not
within
the
province
or
at
the
discretion
of
pius
to
alter
the
tenure
by
which
he
held
his
throne
to
change
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
church
or
to
abolish
his
ecclesiastical
dominion
he
granted
to
his
subjects
all
that
was
in
his
power
to
grant
as
their
temporal
sovereign
his
purely
ecclesiastical
relations
and
duties
did
not
concern
them
or
concerned
them
only
so
far
as
they
were
members
of
the
great
body
of
catholic
believers
in
all
lands
the
college
of
cardinals
choose
the
pope
and
choose
one
of
their
own
number
this
is
not
a
law
of
the
roman
states
but
a
law
of
the
catholic
church
pius
could
not
abrogate
it
and
if
he
had
been
inclined
to
grant
everything
to
his
people
by
divesting
himself
of
the
last
rag
of
his
sovereignty
the
only
consequence
would
have
been
that
the
cardinals
must
have
chosen
another
pope
in
his
place
who
might
undo
all
that
pius
had
accomplished
these
are
obvious
and
necessary
considerations
and
the
pope
expressly
recognizes
them
in
the
ordinance
accompanying
the
grant
of
the
constitution
we
intend
he
says
to
maintain
intact
our
authority
in
matters
that
by
their
nature
are
related
to
the
catholic
religion
and
its
rule
of
morals
and
this
is
due
from
us
as
a
guaranty
to
the
whole
of
christendom
that
in
the
states
of
the
church
reorganized
in
this
new
form
nothing
shall
be
derogated
from
the
liberties
and
rights
of
the
church
herself
and
of
the
holy
see
nor
any
precedent
be
established
for
violating
the
sacredness
of
the
religion
which
it
is
our
duty
and
mission
to
preach
to
the
whole
world
as
the
only
scheme
of
covenant
between
god
and
man
the
only
pledge
of
that
heavenly
benediction
by
which
states
subsist
and
nations
flourish
now
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
neither
this
constitution
nor
any
of
the
acts
of
pius
under
it
was
ever
complained
of
by
any
party
among
the
pope
subjects
except
in
regard
to
these
ecclesiastical
reservations
which
were
forced
from
him
by
the
very
nature
of
the
office
that
he
held
the
constitutionalists
indeed
the
moderate
reformers
the
party
of
balbo
and
gioberti
and
which
comprised
most
of
the
educated
and
reflecting
persons
in
the
state
seem
to
have
been
entirely
satisfied
with
it
as
a
whole
or
as
it
was
so
also
were
the
unthinking
populace
who
received
it
with
shouts
of
exultation
so
long
as
they
were
not
moved
by
the
arts
of
a
party
who
would
not
be
satisfied
with
having
a
good
pope
but
were
bent
upon
having
no
pope
at
all
this
was
the
party
of
mazzini
the
revolutionists
as
distinguished
from
the
reformers
not
strong
at
first
either
in
numbers
or
credit
as
we
have
seen
but
who
made
up
for
all
deficiencies
by
their
zeal
and
activity
who
were
determined
to
establish
a
republic
and
who
cared
nothing
for
the
embarrassments
of
the
pope
situation
as
head
of
the
church
of
indeed
for
the
church
itself
they
complained
and
with
reason
too
upon
their
principles
of
these
ecclesiastical
reservations
and
they
made
out
of
them
their
chief
weapon
of
attack
upon
the
pope
government
though
they
did
not
profit
so
much
by
the
use
of
it
as
by
the
evident
unwillingness
of
pius
to
rush
into
a
war
with
austria
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
sovereignty
of
lombardy
to
charles
albert
a
measure
to
which
he
was
averse
because
he
thought
such
a
conflict
would
be
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
the
church
over
which
he
presided
the
world
future
judgment
of
pius
will
depend
upon
its
belief
of
the
sincerity
with
which
he
acted
in
thus
allowing
nothing
but
his
religious
duties
and
his
position
as
the
head
of
the
church
to
limit
his
concessions
of
political
privileges
to
his
subjects
on
this
point
it
is
well
to
hear
the
opinion
of
farini
who
as
one
of
the
mamiani
ministry
and
as
employed
to
mediate
between
them
and
the
pope
because
much
loved
and
trusted
by
him
seems
peculiarly
qualified
to
form
one
without
undue
bias
on
either
side
pius
ix
had
applied
himself
to
political
reform
not
so
much
for
the
reason
that
his
conscience
as
an
honorable
man
and
a
most
pious
sovereign
enjoined
it
as
because
his
high
view
of
the
papal
office
prompted
him
to
employ
the
temporal
power
for
the
benefit
of
his
spiritual
authority
a
meek
man
and
a
benevolent
prince
pius
ix
was
as
a
pontiff
lofty
even
to
sternness
with
a
soul
not
only
devout
but
mystical
he
referred
everything
to
god
and
respected
and
venerated
his
own
person
as
standing
in
god
place
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
guard
with
jealousy
the
temporal
sovereignty
of
the
church
because
he
thought
it
essential
to
the
and
the
apostleship
of
the
faith
aware
of
the
numerous
vices
of
that
temporal
government
and
hostile
to
all
vice
and
all
its
agents
he
had
sought
on
mounting
the
throne
to
effect
those
reforms
which
justice
public
opinion
and
the
times
required
he
hoped
to
give
lustre
to
the
papacy
by
their
means
and
so
to
extend
and
to
consolidate
the
faith
he
hoped
to
acquire
for
the
clergy
that
credit
which
is
a
great
part
of
the
decorum
of
religion
and
an
efficient
cause
of
reverence
and
devotion
in
the
people
his
first
efforts
were
successful
in
such
a
degree
that
no
pontiff
ever
got
greater
praise
by
this
he
was
greatly
stimulated
and
encouraged
and
perhaps
he
gave
in
to
the
seduction
of
applause
and
the
temptations
of
popularity
more
than
is
fitting
for
a
man
of
decision
or
for
a
prudent
prince
but
when
after
a
little
europe
was
shaken
by
universal
revolution
the
work
he
had
commenced
was
in
his
view
marred
he
then
retired
within
himself
and
took
alarm
in
his
heart
the
pontiff
always
came
before
the
prince
the
priest
before
the
citizen
in
the
secret
struggles
of
his
mind
pontifical
and
priestly
conference
always
outweighed
the
conscience
of
the
prince
and
citizen
and
as
his
conscience
was
a
very
timid
one
it
followed
that
his
inward
conflicts
were
frequent
that
hesitation
was
a
matter
of
course
and
that
he
often
took
resolutions
even
about
temporal
affairs
more
from
religious
intuition
or
impulse
than
from
his
judgment
as
a
man
added
to
this
his
health
was
weak
and
susceptible
of
nervous
excitement
the
dregs
of
his
old
complaint
from
this
he
suffered
most
when
his
mind
was
most
troubled
and
uneasy
another
cause
of
wavering
and
changefulness
under
the
pressure
of
the
extraordinary
occurrences
throughout
europe
early
in
the
spring
of
the
pope
new
ministry
under
the
constitution
proceeded
vigorously
and
rapidly
to
give
full
development
and
efficiency
to
that
instrument
they
also
expressed
the
wish
for
a
firm
union
of
the
constitutional
thrones
of
italy
with
one
another
with
a
view
to
insuring
her
independence
and
they
ordered
the
papal
banners
to
be
decorated
with
pennons
of
the
italian
tricolor
on
march
the
news
of
the
revolution
at
vienna
much
magnified
by
report
arrived
and
the
excitement
of
the
roman
populace
knew
no
bounds
every
bell
in
the
city
pealed
for
joy
from
palace
and
from
hovel
from
magazine
and
workshop
the
townspeople
poured
in
throngs
into
the
streets
and
squares
some
took
to
letting
off
firearms
some
to
strewing
flowers
some
hoisted
flags
on
the
towers
some
decked
with
them
their
balconies
everybody
was
shouting
italia
and
cursing
the
empire
in
an
access
of
fury
the
austrian
arms
were
torn
down
dashed
to
pieces
and
befouled
amid
the
applause
of
the
crowd
in
spite
of
the
dissuasion
of
the
public
functionaries
and
of
prudent
persons
the
hostility
to
the
jesuits
now
threatened
to
break
out
into
violence
and
for
the
double
purpose
of
protecting
them
and
appeasing
the
passions
of
the
mob
the
pope
consented
that
the
schools
which
they
had
superintended
should
be
given
into
other
hands
that
their
associations
should
be
disbanded
and
they
should
be
exiled
the
government
perhaps
had
no
choice
so
swiftly
and
impetuously
did
the
torrent
of
popular
commotion
roll
i
will
not
affirm
that
the
pope
and
the
government
ought
to
have
exposed
to
the
last
hazard
the
security
of
the
state
for
an
ineffectual
defence
of
the
fraternity
what
i
wish
to
observe
is
that
if
there
were
among
the
jesuits
men
stained
with
guilt
and
mischievous
plotters
they
ought
to
have
been
watched
and
punished
as
bad
citizens
but
it
was
incompatible
with
propriety
or
justice
to
condemn
and
punish
a
religious
association
as
such
in
a
place
where
the
pope
held
both
his
own
seat
and
the
supreme
authority
of
the
church
none
but
the
pope
had
the
power
to
condemn
the
society
as
a
whole
and
no
condemnation
but
his
could
be
just
or
valid
in
the
opinion
and
conscience
of
the
catholics
or
produce
the
desired
political
effects
on
the
same
day
that
the
jesuits
were
expelled
the
pope
issued
a
noble
proclamation
breathing
the
best
spirit
of
religion
the
following
excerpt
is
a
portion
of
it
papa
ix
to
the
people
of
the
states
of
italy
health
and
apostolic
the
events
which
the
last
two
months
have
witnessed
following
and
thronging
one
another
in
such
rapid
succession
are
no
work
of
man
woe
to
him
that
does
not
discern
the
lord
voice
in
this
blast
that
agitates
uproots
and
rends
the
cedar
and
the
oak
woe
to
the
pride
of
man
if
he
shall
refer
these
marvellous
changes
to
any
human
merit
or
any
human
fault
if
instead
of
adoring
the
hidden
designs
of
providence
whether
manifested
in
the
paths
of
his
justice
or
of
his
mercy
or
of
that
providence
in
whose
hands
are
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
we
who
are
endowed
with
speech
in
order
to
interpret
the
dumb
eloquence
of
the
works
of
god
we
can
not
be
mute
amid
the
longings
the
fears
and
the
hopes
which
agitate
the
minds
of
our
children
and
first
it
is
our
duty
to
make
known
to
you
that
if
our
hearts
had
been
moved
at
hearing
how
in
a
part
of
italy
the
consolations
of
religion
have
preceded
the
perils
of
battle
and
nobleness
of
mind
has
been
displayed
in
works
of
charity
we
nevertheless
could
not
and
can
not
but
greatly
grieve
over
the
injuries
which
in
other
places
have
been
done
to
the
ministers
of
that
same
religion
injuries
even
if
contrary
to
our
duty
we
were
silent
concerning
them
our
silence
could
not
hinder
from
impairing
the
efficacy
of
our
benedictions
neither
can
we
refrain
from
telling
you
that
to
use
victory
well
is
a
greater
and
more
difficult
achievement
than
to
be
victorious
if
the
present
day
recalls
to
you
any
other
period
of
your
history
let
the
children
profit
by
the
errors
of
their
forefathers
remember
that
all
stability
and
all
prosperity
has
its
main
earthly
ground
in
concord
that
it
is
god
alone
who
maketh
of
one
mind
them
that
dwell
in
a
house
that
he
grants
this
reward
only
to
the
humble
and
the
meek
to
those
who
respect
his
laws
in
the
liberty
of
his
church
in
the
order
of
society
in
charity
toward
all
mankind
shortly
afterward
another
measure
emanating
entirely
from
the
pope
and
opposed
by
the
prejudices
of
the
mob
showed
that
his
humane
and
liberal
disposition
and
enlightened
understanding
waited
for
no
impulse
from
without
and
for
no
hope
of
increased
popularity
before
doing
justice
to
a
long
oppressed
race
the
friends
of
social
progress
were
highly
gratified
by
the
decision
of
pius
ix
to
raze
in
rome
the
walls
and
gates
which
shut
up
the
jews
in
the
ghetto
he
had
already
at
the
commencement
of
his
pontificate
softened
some
of
the
rigors
with
which
they
were
afflicted
and
had
directed
that
they
might
spread
beyond
that
ignominious
precinct
nor
however
great
was
the
outcry
about
it
among
the
mob
did
he
forego
the
idea
of
bettering
the
condition
of
the
followers
of
the
mosaic
law
he
was
disposed
to
give
them
civil
rights
and
if
he
did
not
think
of
extending
his
concessions
even
to
political
privileges
yet
he
would
give
this
as
the
main
reason
for
it
that
in
a
constitutional
country
everyone
who
enjoys
them
may
rise
to
the
highest
stages
of
power
whereas
a
pope
could
not
have
any
save
catholic
ministers
in
the
mean
time
he
raised
them
out
of
the
abjectness
of
their
isolation
although
the
roman
vulgar
censured
him
for
it
bitterly
most
of
all
because
it
took
effect
in
holy
week
when
it
was
known
in
the
city
that
the
walls
and
fastenings
of
the
ghetto
were
to
be
pulled
down
at
night
by
order
of
the
cardinal
vicar
ciceruacchio
hastened
with
his
companions
or
subjects
to
share
in
the
work
and
they
shared
in
it
so
largely
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
thing
were
effected
more
as
their
boon
than
by
the
will
of
the
pope
pius
ix
was
vexed
at
this
whether
because
noise
had
been
made
about
what
he
wanted
done
quietly
or
because
it
was
brought
about
in
such
a
manner
that
it
might
seem
the
popular
party
had
had
more
to
say
to
it
than
the
authority
of
the
head
of
religion
rome
fully
shared
the
enthusiasm
which
was
awakened
throughout
italy
by
the
entrance
of
the
piedmontese
troops
into
lombardy
and
by
the
announcement
by
charles
albert
that
he
had
drawn
the
sword
in
the
sacred
cause
of
italian
independence
his
proclamation
in
the
stilted
phrase
common
to
such
state
papers
declared
that
he
relied
upon
the
assistance
of
that
god
who
is
visibly
with
us
of
that
god
who
has
given
pius
ix
to
italy
of
that
god
who
by
such
wondrous
impulses
has
placed
her
in
a
condition
to
act
for
herself
and
if
she
acted
for
herself
if
her
deeds
had
been
commensurate
with
her
glorious
words
the
austrian
would
never
again
have
trodden
any
portion
of
the
peninsula
with
the
step
of
a
master
but
the
zeal
of
the
italians
for
independence
seemed
all
to
evaporate
in
manifestoes
and
in
a
few
excesses
of
the
populace
in
the
great
cities
the
inactivity
of
the
italian
sovereigns
may
be
explained
by
their
imputed
treachery
or
lukewarmness
in
the
cause
but
what
prevented
the
people
themselves
from
crowding
the
camp
of
charles
albert
with
volunteers
at
a
time
when
not
a
crowned
head
in
italy
dared
offer
the
least
open
opposition
to
such
a
movement
the
king
of
naples
sorely
against
his
will
sent
his
regular
army
consisting
of
about
fourteen
thousand
men
to
fight
for
the
cause
and
withdrew
them
in
about
six
weeks
as
soon
as
a
base
act
of
treachery
had
given
him
the
victory
at
home
general
pepe
their
commander
wished
to
disobey
the
order
and
move
forward
but
nearly
the
whole
army
turned
its
back
on
the
po
and
on
him
and
moved
backward
in
the
direction
of
the
neapolitan
kingdom
two
hundred
volunteers
had
previously
set
out
from
naples
for
upper
italy
under
the
guidance
and
at
the
expense
of
an
enthusiastic
woman
the
princess
belgioioso
she
had
lived
as
an
exile
in
france
and
was
at
first
enthusiastic
for
the
she
afterward
became
averse
to
it
and
sided
with
guizot
duchâtel
and
mignet
her
intimate
friend
she
was
well
versed
or
mixed
herself
much
in
literature
politics
the
study
of
theology
and
journalism
a
woman
that
had
some
of
the
feelings
and
anxieties
of
men
together
with
all
those
of
her
own
sex
and
who
was
now
travelling
through
italy
intent
upon
manly
business
but
after
woman
fashion
other
volunteers
afterward
started
and
a
vessel
set
sail
for
leghorn
which
carried
them
along
with
the
tenth
regiment
of
the
line
the
sicilians
at
the
same
time
determined
to
separate
entirely
from
naples
and
the
rest
of
the
peninsula
and
thus
all
the
ability
and
spirit
the
arms
and
wealth
of
that
powerful
island
were
applied
to
the
effort
for
insular
independence
and
drawn
off
from
that
for
the
independence
of
the
nation
from
tuscany
there
went
to
this
national
war
about
three
thousand
volunteers
and
perhaps
as
many
more
regulars
a
number
so
small
that
farini
apologizes
for
it
and
endeavors
to
prove
that
it
ought
not
to
be
imputed
to
any
lukewarmness
in
the
affection
for
italy
the
army
from
the
roman
states
which
the
pope
had
set
on
foot
but
hoped
to
retain
as
a
defensive
force
within
the
northern
boundary
of
his
dominions
numbered
about
sixteen
thousand
of
whom
more
than
half
were
volunteers
the
conduct
of
the
people
of
lombardy
who
though
the
conflict
raged
on
their
own
soil
and
their
own
freedom
was
immediately
at
stake
wasted
their
strength
in
quarrelling
with
one
another
instead
of
succoring
charles
albert
has
long
been
a
topic
of
wonder
and
censure
in
short
all
italy
did
not
furnish
for
this
sacred
war
so
long
the
object
of
her
aspirations
and
her
prayers
a
body
of
volunteers
as
large
as
the
army
which
the
king
of
sardinia
brought
into
the
field
though
it
was
probable
that
he
was
moved
from
the
first
only
by
the
hope
of
personal
aggrandizement
he
invaded
lombardy
with
an
army
of
thousand
men
expecting
thereby
to
win
with
the
aid
of
the
national
enthusiasm
the
sceptre
of
all
italy
for
himself
and
his
descendants
a
terrible
disappointment
awaited
him
instead
of
glory
shame
and
defeat
were
his
portion
and
having
abdicated
his
paternal
throne
in
despair
he
died
in
exile
literally
of
a
broken
heart
pius
ix
was
hardly
more
fortunate
to
him
also
this
fatal
war
brought
dishonor
and
exile
the
loss
of
the
affection
of
his
subjects
and
of
the
admiration
of
the
civilized
world
the
reluctance
of
the
pope
to
engage
when
unprovoked
in
a
war
with
austria
is
no
cause
for
wonder
he
earnestly
desired
the
welfare
of
his
people
and
the
independence
of
his
native
land
but
all
his
desires
were
subject
to
the
interests
of
the
church
of
which
he
was
the
recognized
head
throughout
christendom
the
republicans
in
his
dominions
including
mazzini
and
his
party
were
aware
of
this
reluctance
and
determined
to
make
use
of
it
and
of
the
passions
of
the
people
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
altogether
no
opportunity
was
lost
to
compromise
him
in
the
war
both
in
his
temporal
and
ecclesiastical
character
and
the
misfortune
of
his
twofold
position
did
not
allow
him
to
resist
these
machinations
with
success
general
durando
the
commander
of
the
papal
forces
issued
a
flaming
proclamation
to
his
army
when
they
passed
the
po
announcing
to
them
that
their
swords
were
blessed
by
the
venerable
head
of
the
church
and
that
they
should
all
wear
the
cross
on
their
bosoms
as
beseemed
those
who
were
engaged
in
a
holy
war
this
act
naturally
gave
great
uneasiness
to
the
pope
and
farini
censures
it
as
an
unwise
attempt
to
obtain
the
sanctions
of
religion
for
merely
political
objects
the
very
conduct
which
the
liberal
party
had
previously
censured
in
their
opponents
if
italian
minds
he
argues
were
not
capable
of
warming
with
the
simple
fire
of
patriotism
for
the
noble
and
even
holy
enterprise
of
liberating
italy
from
the
stranger
it
was
vain
to
hope
that
hearts
so
frozen
up
in
indifference
could
kindle
with
religious
faith
in
the
mean
time
the
germans
who
were
speculating
about
the
unity
of
their
own
stock
and
nation
and
were
straining
every
nerve
in
that
difficult
enterprise
could
not
excuse
the
desire
of
independence
in
the
italians
and
contended
for
the
boasted
rights
of
austria
and
germany
over
the
lands
and
the
coasts
of
italy
with
the
people
that
inhabited
them
when
it
became
known
in
germany
that
the
pontifical
troops
were
hastening
to
the
legitimate
defence
of
italy
it
affected
the
public
feeling
generally
and
the
name
of
pius
ix
was
branded
with
censure
not
by
laymen
only
but
by
some
bishops
and
high
ecclesiastics
monsignor
viale
nuncio
at
vienna
and
monsignor
sacconi
nuncio
at
munich
were
assiduous
and
eager
in
detailing
the
sinister
reports
touching
rome
and
the
pope
and
colored
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
create
an
apprehension
of
schism
the
most
serious
one
that
could
rise
for
a
pope
and
that
pope
too
pius
ix
he
had
before
this
been
greatly
troubled
by
the
proclamation
of
general
durando
still
he
had
hoped
that
the
italian
league
would
be
shortly
concluded
and
that
when
he
had
furnished
the
quota
of
troops
that
might
be
due
from
him
as
a
temporal
sovereign
he
would
then
have
been
able
in
the
capacity
of
pontiff
to
use
those
good
offices
which
he
considered
requisite
to
assure
the
consciences
of
catholics
even
the
news
of
some
reverses
to
the
italian
arms
in
lombardy
failed
to
awaken
a
proper
feeling
among
the
inhabitants
of
central
and
southern
italy
and
farini
thus
censures
the
slothfulness
and
vanity
of
his
countrymen
few
gave
credit
or
importance
at
the
time
to
this
and
other
sinister
intelligence
the
greater
part
of
those
who
beheld
the
first
marvellous
smiles
of
fortune
relied
upon
the
star
of
italy
and
thought
the
empire
was
dismembered
we
italians
are
too
susceptible
to
the
impulses
of
passion
and
of
heat
in
the
imagination
with
a
small
matter
we
are
drunken
and
think
to
leap
over
the
moon
deadly
intoxication
most
deadly
fault
that
of
undervaluing
an
enemy
which
lets
our
enthusiasm
too
easily
evaporate
and
gives
him
every
facility
for
showing
that
he
is
as
gallant
as
we
are
and
more
resolute
that
he
has
much
of
perseverance
and
of
discipline
qualities
more
effectual
and
valuable
than
simple
courage
it
comes
to
this
we
must
either
send
about
their
business
the
dreams
of
poets
and
educate
ourselves
in
severe
and
masculine
virtues
or
must
yet
remain
long
in
a
position
to
chant
many
more
elegies
to
assuage
our
sorrow
than
hymns
of
triumph
we
must
either
rest
assured
that
with
the
tenacious
the
disciplined
and
the
resolute
only
the
tenacious
disciplined
and
resolute
can
cope
and
must
therefore
leave
off
despising
the
austrians
and
imitate
them
in
their
steadiness
and
their
attention
to
the
military
spirit
or
else
we
must
be
doomed
to
the
disgrace
of
seeing
them
masters
of
our
country
a
stern
truth
but
the
only
one
that
an
italian
freeman
can
utter
to
italians
free
in
mind
he
who
wants
compliments
and
adulation
may
fling
these
warning
words
from
him
the
ministry
at
rome
driven
onward
by
the
popular
clamor
represented
to
the
pope
in
strong
terms
the
necessity
of
sending
orders
to
his
army
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
war
for
they
had
not
yet
commenced
hostilities
with
the
austrians
a
consistory
of
the
cardinals
was
to
be
held
on
april
and
it
was
feared
that
pius
would
take
that
occasion
for
declaring
that
he
was
averse
to
the
war
thus
pacifying
the
minds
of
the
catholics
in
germany
the
allocution
of
the
pope
realized
these
fears
though
it
expressed
only
his
wish
to
remain
neutral
and
to
embrace
all
kindreds
peoples
and
nations
with
equal
solicitude
of
paternal
affection
but
the
ministry
resigned
in
consequence
and
great
disturbances
arose
in
the
city
the
populace
were
not
willing
themselves
to
volunteer
for
the
war
but
they
were
determined
that
the
pope
should
not
continue
a
man
of
peace
the
civic
guard
was
placed
under
arms
but
it
was
soon
found
that
the
soldiers
shared
the
feelings
of
the
people
and
no
reliance
could
be
placed
upon
them
threats
were
uttered
of
assassinating
the
cardinals
and
others
cried
out
to
make
short
work
as
they
called
it
with
the
government
of
the
priests
those
traitors
to
italy
and
to
place
rome
under
popular
sway
to
avert
bloodshed
the
pope
consented
to
a
compromise
he
gave
up
the
entire
direction
of
his
troops
to
charles
albert
and
published
of
his
own
accord
and
without
the
knowledge
of
his
ministers
an
affecting
remonstrance
to
his
people
pius
also
wrote
an
earnest
letter
to
the
emperor
of
austria
entreating
him
to
put
a
stop
to
the
war
by
acknowledging
the
independence
of
venetia
and
lombardy
let
not
the
generous
german
nation
take
it
ill
he
said
if
we
invite
them
to
lay
resentment
aside
and
to
convert
into
the
beneficial
relations
of
friendly
neighborhood
a
domination
which
could
never
be
prosperous
or
noble
while
it
depended
solely
on
the
sword
but
the
prayers
of
the
pope
had
now
little
influence
either
with
the
emperor
or
with
his
own
subjects
he
had
long
ago
forfeited
the
favor
of
the
absolutists
by
his
political
reforms
and
he
had
now
lost
the
love
of
his
people
by
his
reluctance
to
gratify
their
passion
for
sway
yet
if
he
had
basely
yielded
to
their
wishes
against
his
judgment
and
his
conscience
he
would
have
injured
only
the
cause
of
the
papacy
in
foreign
lands
and
the
issue
of
the
war
would
not
have
been
changed
as
it
was
his
troops
were
actively
engaged
in
the
contest
till
the
time
of
their
capture
at
vicenza
by
the
austrians
the
fatal
blow
was
given
to
the
hopes
of
italy
by
the
king
of
naples
withdrawing
his
troops
at
a
critical
moment
when
their
loss
could
not
be
replaced
their
departure
and
the
consequent
capture
of
the
papal
army
under
durando
at
vicenza
enabled
the
austrians
to
turn
their
whole
force
against
the
piedmontese
who
were
then
defeated
and
driven
back
the
disgraceful
capitulation
at
milan
followed
and
the
cause
of
united
italy
was
lost
forever
brilliant
as
its
promise
had
been
at
the
outset
the
revolution
of
terminated
as
pitifully
as
did
those
of
and
and
for
its
disastrous
issue
the
italians
have
none
to
blame
but
themselves
misfortunes
and
defeat
had
their
usual
effect
in
inflaming
the
rage
of
parties
the
personal
influence
of
the
pope
could
no
longer
keep
the
passions
of
the
citizens
in
check
and
the
clubs
now
governed
rome
with
absolute
sway
the
party
of
mazzini
bent
on
trying
the
experiment
of
a
republic
at
all
hazards
began
to
show
its
head
after
a
long
period
of
inefficiency
and
discouragement
and
every
day
acquired
new
adherents
and
stronger
influence
one
ministry
after
another
tried
in
vain
to
steer
the
ship
of
state
on
an
even
course
between
the
opposite
perils
of
the
domination
of
a
mob
and
the
rigorous
enforcement
of
the
laws
the
pope
tried
for
some
months
the
experiment
of
a
popular
administration
under
mamiani
of
whom
our
author
says
he
seemed
to
play
the
part
of
a
tribune
of
the
people
more
than
of
the
pope
minister
still
he
was
an
honest
man
opposed
to
violence
to
tumult
and
to
all
excesses
though
he
paid
too
much
deference
to
the
clubs
which
were
now
as
turbulent
and
mischievous
as
their
parisian
prototypes
the
acts
of
his
ministry
were
not
numerous
farini
says
for
the
character
of
the
times
would
not
admit
of
dispassionate
inquiries
and
solid
reforms
in
truth
the
energies
of
government
were
exhausted
in
a
vain
attempt
to
keep
the
peace
in
the
city
which
was
now
a
constant
scene
of
turbulence
and
disorder
bologna
also
having
successfully
repelled
an
unauthorized
attack
made
upon
it
by
the
austrians
under
welden
had
become
a
prey
to
the
wildest
confusion
owing
to
the
continuance
there
of
the
irregular
bands
of
armed
men
who
had
contributed
to
its
defence
at
the
urgent
request
of
the
bolognese
deputies
the
ministry
determined
to
send
thither
one
of
their
own
number
to
aid
in
restoring
order
and
farini
was
deputed
for
this
purpose
the
following
is
a
portion
of
his
account
of
what
he
saw
there
and
what
he
accomplished
in
the
streets
and
open
places
of
the
city
for
two
days
the
brigands
had
been
slaughtering
every
man
his
enemy
among
the
government
officers
some
of
them
indeed
disreputable
and
sorry
fellows
others
respectable
they
killed
with
and
if
the
fallen
gave
signs
of
life
they
reloaded
their
arms
in
the
sight
of
the
people
and
the
soldiers
and
fired
them
afresh
or
else
put
an
end
to
their
victims
with
their
knives
they
hunted
men
down
like
wild
beasts
entered
their
houses
and
dragged
them
forth
to
slaughter
one
bianchi
an
inspector
of
police
was
lying
in
bed
reduced
to
agony
by
consumption
they
came
in
set
upon
him
and
cut
his
throat
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
and
children
the
corpse
a
frightful
spectacle
remained
in
the
public
streets

it

about

the
abominable

who
had
given
notice
of
his
arrival
came
the
day
after
and
the
armed
commons
escorted
him
to
the
palace
at
the
very
time
when
the
villains
were
perpetrating
their
murders
there
were
no
longer
any
judges
or
any
officers
of
the
police
those
who
had
escaped
death
either
had
fled
or
had
hidden
themselves
the
civic
guard
was
disarmed
the
citizens
killed
the
few
soldiers
of
the
line
either
mixed
with
the
insurgents
or
were
wholly
without
spirit
the
carbineers
and
dragoons
in
hesitation
the
volunteer
legions
and
free
corps
a
support
to
the
rioters
not
to
the
authority
of
government
we
sent
to
rome
for
leave
to
declare
bologna
in
a
state
of
siege
but
the
answer
was
that
the
ministry
having
taken
the
opinion
of
the
council
of
state
considered
that
order
might
be
restored
without
recourse
to
this
extreme
measure
all
our
best
exertions
were
made
to
draw
to
the
side
of
government
the
carbineers
and
dragoons
as
also
bellezzi
and
the
honest
leaders
of
the
people
but
with
little
success
it
was
reported
that
bellezzi
himself
had
given
leave
to
kill
those
whom
they
called
the
spies
one
masina
came
before
us
proposing
by
way
of
compromise
to
banish
those
whose
lives
were
threatened
armed
men
were
in
the
very
palace
of
government
and
we
ourselves
at
their
mercy
accident
however
effected
at
a
stroke
what
we
could
have
done
only
slowly
and
with
difficulty
an
assassin
attempted
the
life
of
a
carbineer
his
companions
inflamed
with
anger
pursued
him
and
caught
him
in
a
church
they
then
volunteered
their
most
resolute
efforts
at
repression
they
were
ordered
to
sally
forth
arrest
and
disarm
the
ruffians
the
dragoons
seconded
them
young
pepoli
commandant
of
the
civic
guard
mustered
a
few
companies
bianchetti
and
the
respected
citizens
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
drew
close
around
us
and
we
hurried
in
the
swiss
from
forli
the
population
began
to
regain
its
courage
and
to
applaud
the
carbineers
as
they
arrested
the
assassins
the
swiss
entered
amid
cheers
the
disturbances
at
bologna
were
quelled
but
the
bonds
of
law
and
order
throughout
the
papal
states
were
now
loosened
and
it
became
evident
that
a
more
determined
minister
must
be
placed
at
the
helm
or
the
experiment
of
the
existing
form
of
government
must
be
abandoned
in
despair
a
republic
or
a
return
to
the
old
principles
of
despotism
would
then
be
inevitable
in
this
emergency
the
eyes
of
the
pope
and
of
all
prudent
persons
at
rome
were
turned
to
rossi
who
since
the
fall
of
louis
philippe
government
from
which
he
had
been
ambassador
to
the
roman
states
had
resided
there
as
a
private
citizen
taking
no
active
share
in
politics
but
often
consulted
by
both
parties
owing
to
his
high
reputation
for
sagacity
and
firmness
exiled
on
account
of
his
liberal
opinions
by
gregory
he
had
laid
the
foundation
of
his
fame
at
paris
where
he
successively
became
professor
peer
and
ambassador
and
was
highly
esteemed
by
all
parties
as
a
writer
and
a
statesman
once
before
pius
had
solicited
him
to
form
a
ministry
but
he
had
declined
because
conscious
that
the
affections
of
the
populace
were
not
with
him
and
he
judged
that
the
minds
even
of
the
better
portion
of
the
citizens
were
not
yet
prepared
for
a
resolute
attempt
to
carry
on
a
constitutional
government
by
firm
measures
he
suggested
to
the
pope
that
he
was
probably
odious
to
the
court
on
account
of
his
previous
employments
and
his
writings
that
some
would
perhaps
look
very
coldly
on
a
minister
who
had
married
a
protestant
wife
and
that
the
french
republic
might
be
displeased
if
he
should
hold
a
high
post
at
rome
but
in
the
middle
of
september
the
solicitations
of
the
pope
and
of
many
respectable
persons
in
the
state
became
so
urgent
that
rossi
consented
to
serve
the
opinion
was
universal
that
no
other
person
possessed
the
requisite
abilities
character
and
experience
to
carry
on
the
government
at
this
perilous
crisis
and
that
if
he
failed
all
indeed
was
lost
he
selected
for
his
colleagues
men
of
liberal
politics
but
temperate
in
their
opinions
he
announced
his
intention
to
carry
into
effect
the
fundamental
statute
in
all
its
parts
according
to
constitutional
usage
to
counteract
and
repress
both
parties
opposed
to
that
instrument
to
abolish
exemptions
restore
the
finances
and
reorganize
the
army
to
conclude
a
league
with
piedmont
and
tuscany
even
if
it
should
be
impossible
with
naples
and
to
fix
the
contingent
of
troops
which
the
pope
was
to
supply
so
that
he
need
not
in
any
way
mingle
in
the
war
the
turbulent
and
the
presumptuous
the
magistrates
accustomed
to
fatten
upon
abuses
the
sanfedists
who
made
a
livelihood
of
disorder
and
the
clergy
greedy
of
gold
and
honors
could
ill
bear
that
pellegrino
rossi
should
have
the
authority
of
a
minister
but
those
who
knew
the
real
condition
of
affairs
and
that
unless
the
finances
were
improved
and
public
discipline
and
order
restored
all
would
go
to
wreck
counted
it
great
gain
that
he
should
take
charge
of
the
debilitated
state
the
dissatisfied
were
more
numerous
and
noisy
in
the
capital
the
contented
stronger
in
the
provinces
especially
at
bologna
where
an
educated
community
wished
for
a
liberal
system
with
a
government
strong
in
the
strength
of
the
law
where
the
recent
terrible
events
had
filled
every
mind
with
horror
and
where
rossi
the
proscribed
of
was
dear
to
memory
and
rooted
in
public
esteem
the
roman
legislature
was
to
meet
again
in
the
middle
of
november
so
that
the
new
minister
was
chiefly
occupied
with
maturing
the
measures
which
were
to
be
laid
before
it
for
adoption
his
public
acts
therefore
were
few
but
they
were
enough
to
show
that
new
wisdom
and
vigor
directed
the
course
of
affairs
he
obtained
the
pope
consent
that
the
clergy
should
make
a
new
contribution
of
two
millions
of
crowns
to
the
state
on
the
strength
of
which
he
obtained
a
new
loan
and
punctually
paid
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
he
invited
general
zucchi
home
from
switzerland
to
take
the
command
of
the
army
which
rapidly
improved
in
discipline
under
his
energetic
guidance
he
distributed
medals
to
those
who
had
been
wounded
and
to
the
families
of
the
slain
at
vicenza
he
established
two
lines
of
telegraph
one
to
ferrara
by
the
way
of
bologna
and
another
to
civita
vecchia
the
negotiations
with
sardinia
and
tuscany
for
an
italian
league
were
advanced
nearly
to
completion
chairs
of
political
economy
and
commercial
law
were
founded
in
the
universities
at
rome
and
bologna
toward
the
close
of
october
the
mob
rose
in
rome
on
occasion
of
a
squabble
between
a
jew
and
a
catholic
and
threatened
to
sack
the
ghetto
and
maltreat
its
inhabitants
rossi
hurried
the
civic
guard
and
the
carbineers
to
the
spot
allayed
the
tumult
arrested
and
imprisoned
some
of
its
ringleaders
and
published
an
energetic
proclamation
to
warn
the
turbulent
that
the
laws
would
be
enforced
all
these
proceedings
excited
the
anger
of
rossi
enemies
the
journalists
the
captains
of
the
people
and
the
roman
clubs
there
was
no
opprobrium
that
was
not
heaped
upon
him
no
charge
that
was
not
levelled
at
the
government
but
these
declamations
seemed
to
have
little
effect
on
the
body
of
the
people
on
the
morning
of
november
when
the
legislature
was
to
commence
its
session
though
knots
of
persons
were
seen
talking
in
the
streets
with
excited
countenances
there
was
no
outbreak
or
popular
tumult
rossi
had
received
many
anonymous
letters
in
which
his
life
was
threatened
but
he
scorned
to
take
any
notice
of
them
this
morning
one
came
which
directly
affirmed
that
he
would
be
assassinated
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
he
threw
it
into
the
fire
the
regulation
of
the
police
now
that
the
day
of
the
session
had
arrived
belonged
to
the
president
of
the
council
of
deputies
and
rossi
punctilious
in
the
observance
of
the
constitution
refused
to
give
them
any
orders
several
of
his
friends
came
and
remonstrated
with
him
against
such
an
exposure
of
his
life
to
all
this
he
answered
that
he
had
taken
the
measures
which
he
thought
suitable
for
keeping
the
seditious
in
order
and
that
he
could
not
on
account
of
risk
that
he
might
personally
run
forego
repairing
to
the
council
according
to
his
duty
that
perhaps
these
were
idle
menaces
but
if
anyone
thirsted
for
his
blood
he
would
have
the
means
of
shedding
it
elsewhere
on
some
other
day
even
if
on
that
day
he
should
lose
his
opportunity
he
would
therefore
go
he
was
elated
by
the
confidence
which
the
pope
had
in
him
and
expected
both
trust
and
aid
from
the
parliament
to
which
he
was
so
soon
to
explain
his
ideas
and
intentions
when
the
ordinary
hour
of
the
parliamentary
sitting
which
was
about
noon
arrived
the
people
began
to
gather
in
the
square
of
the
cancellaria
and
by
degrees
in
the
courtyard
and
then
in
the
public
galleries
of
the
hall
soon
these
were
all
full
a
battalion
of
the
civic
guard
was
drawn
up
in
the
square
in
the
court
and
hall
there
was
no
guard
greater
than
ordinary
there
were
however
not
a
few
individuals
armed
with
their
daggers
in
the
dress
of
the
volunteers
returned
from
vicenza
and
wearing
the
medals
with
which
the
municipality
of
rome
had
decorated
them
they
stood
together
and
formed
a
line
from
the
gate
up
to
the
staircase
of
the
palace
sullen
visages
were
to
be
seen
and
ferocious
imprecations
heard
among
them
during
the
time
when
the
deputies
were
slowly
assembling
and
business
could
not
commence
because
there
was
not
yet
a
quorum
present
a
cry
for
help
suddenly
proceeded
from
the
extremity
of
the
public
gallery
on
which
everyone
turned
thither
a
curious
eye
but
nothing
more
was
heard
or
seen
and
those
who
went
to
get
some
explanation
of
the
circumstances
returned
without
success
in
the
mean
time
rossi
carriage
entered
the
court
of
the
palace
he
sat
on
the
right
and
righetti
deputy
minister
of
finance
on
the
left
a
howl
was
raised
in
the
court
and
yard
which
echoed
even
into
the
hall
of
the
council
rossi
got
out
first
and
moved
briskly
as
was
his
habit
in
walking
across
the
short
space
which
leads
from
the
centre
of
the
court
to
the
staircase
on
the
left
hand
righetti
who
descended
after
him
remained
behind
because
the
persons
were
in
the
way
who
caused
the
outcry
and
who
brandishing
their
cutlasses
had
surrounded
rossi
and
were
loading
him
with
opprobrium
at
this
moment
there
was
seen
amid
the
throng
the
flash
of
a
poniard
and
then
rossi
losing
his
feet
and
sinking
to
the
ground
alas
he
was
spouting
blood
from
a
broad
gash
in
the
neck
he
was
raised
by
righetti
but
could
hardly
hold
himself
up
and
did
not
articulate
a
syllable
his
eyes
grew
clouded
and
his
blood
spurted
forth
in
a
copious
jet
some
of
those
whom
i
named
as
clad
in
military
uniform
were
above
upon
the
stairs
they
came
down
and
formed
a
ring
about
the
unhappy
man
and
when
they
saw
him
shedding
blood
and
half
lifeless
they
all
turned
and
rejoined
their
companions
he
was
borne
amid
his
into
the
apartments
of
cardinal
gazzoli
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
on
the
left
side
and
there
after
a
few
moments
he
breathed
his
last
in
leaving
the
palace
of
the
cancellaria
one
met
some
faces
gleaming
with
a
hellish
joy
others
pallid
with
alarm
many
townspeople
standing
as
if
petrified
agitators
running
this
way
and
that
carbineers
the
same
one
kind
of
men
might
be
heard
muttering
imprecations
on
the
assassin
but
the
generality
faltered
in
broken
and
doubtful
accents
some
horrible
to
relate
cursed
the
murdered
man
yes
i
have
still
before
my
eyes
the
livid
countenance
of
one
who
as
he
saw
me
shouted
fare
the
betrayers
of
the
people
but
the
city
was
in
the
depths
of
gloom
as
under
the
hand
of
calamity
and
the
scourge
of
god
and
wherever
there
were
respectable
persons
though
of
liberal
and
italian
principles
they
were
and
called
for
the
resolute
exertions
of
the
authorities
when
the
terrible
news
came
to
the
pope
he
was
struck
with
horror
and
dismay
but
yet
strove
to
rally
the
other
members
of
the
government
around
him
and
preserve
the
state
from
anarchy
but
his
efforts
were
miserably
seconded
one
person
after
another
declined
taking
office
or
continuing
in
it
and
even
when
the
presidents
of
the
two
councils
were
summoned
they
had
little
advice
to
give
on
the
morrow
the
tidings
came
that
a
mob
was
on
its
way
toward
the
quirinal
some
of
the
carbineers
having
fraternized
with
them
to
enforce
the
appointment
of
a
democratic
ministry
and
a
declaration
in
favor
of
a
constituent
assembly
for
all
italy
only
a
few
swiss
the
ordinary
guard
of
honor
were
on
duty
but
they
shut
the
gates
of
the
palace
and
nobly
declared
that
their
own
bodies
should
be
piled
up
behind
them
before
the
rioters
should
enter
galletti
the
former
minister
of
police
acted
as
spokesman
of
the
mob
and
when
admitted
to
an
audience
he
stated
their
demands
the
pope
indignantly
declared
that
he
would
not
yield
to
violence
but
must
deliberate
in
freedom
this
answer
only
inspired
the
insurgents
with
fresh
fury
so
that
they
pressed
forward
to
the
gates
set
one
of
them
on
fire
and
mounting
upon
the
roofs
of
the
neighboring
houses
opened
a
fire
upon
the
walls
and
windows
of
the
quirinal
the
few
swiss
fired
in
return
and
then
the
cry
ran
through
the
city
that
the
pope
guards
were
butchering
the
people
and
already
there
were
many
slain
within
the
palace
many
advised
pius
to
yield
a
few
still
spoke
of
resistance
and
the
foreign
ministers
who
were
collected
there
had
no
scheme
to
offer
the
scuffle
continues
the
worthy
prelate
monsignor
palma
falls
dead
by
the
window
of
his
own
apartment
balls
reach
the
of
the
pope
at
last
pius
turned
to
the
diplomatic
body
who
stood
around
him
and
said
there
is
no
further
hope
in
resistance
already
a
prelate
is
slain
in
my
very
palace
shots
are
aimed
at
it
artillery
levelled
to
avoid
fruitless
bloodshed
and
increased
enormities
we
give
way
but
it
is
as
you
see
only
to
force
therefore
we
protest
let
the
courts
let
your
governments
know
it
we
give
way
to
violence
alone
and
all
we
concede
is
null
and
void
galletti
was
then
asked
to
propose
his
list
of
ministers
from
which
the
pope
indignantly
struck
out
the
name
of
the
neapolitan
salicetti
but
admitted
without
a
word
the
names
of
sterbini
lunati
and
galletti
their
appointment
was
signed
on
the
spot
and
the
news
being
told
to
the
insurgents
they
fired
muskets
in
token
of
joy
and
went
off
with
hymns
for
italy
and
cheers
for
the
italian
constituent
assembly
and
the
democratic
ministry
the
next
day
the
club
desired
that
the
swiss
should
be
deprived
of
their
arms
and
dismissed
from
the
quirinal
the
pope
complied
the
club
then
asked
that
galletti
should
be
named
general
of
the
carbineers
and
he
was
appointed
such
was
the
poltroonery
or
such
the
depravity
of
consciences
that
no
journal
would
or
dared
denounce
the
murder
but
why
do
i
speak
of
denouncing
the
murder
was
honored
with
illuminations
and
festivities
in
numerous
cities
and
not
in
these
states
only
but
beyond
them
especially
at
leghorn
the
councils
met
on
the
and
but
not
a
word
was
said
of
the
murder
and
even
a
proposition
for
giving
assurance
to
the
pope
of
the
devotion
and
unalterable
affection
of
the
deputies
was
voted
down
three
of
the
bolognese
deputies
and
a
few
others
then
indignantly
resigned
their
seats
and
assigned
their
reasons
for
this
step
in
addresses
to
their
constituents
early
on
the
night
of
the
the
pope
secretly
left
the
quirinal
entered
a
carriage
prepared
for
him
by
the
wife
of
the
bavarian
ambassador
and
went
into
exile
from
that
city
which
within
two
years
and
a
half
had
worshipped
scorned
and
assailed
him
the
revolution
of
february
in
france
françois
guizot
and
mme
guizot
de
witt
this
outbreak
marked
one
of
the
many
transitions
in
french
history
leading
to
the
establishment
of
the
second
republic
so
soon
to
be
followed
by
the
of
louis
napoleon
and
the
setting
up
of
the
second
empire
when
france
passed
from
the
rule
of
the
bourbons
represented
by
charles
x
to
that
of
the
orleanists
in
the
hands
of
louis
philippe
the
citizen
king
july
great
hopes
were
entertained
by
the
constitutional
party
that
this
renewal
of
the
monarchy
through
the
july
revolution
would
result
in
permanent
benefits
at
first
the
new
king
enjoyed
great
popularity
in
some
respects
his
government
compared
with
that
of
charles
x
was
liberal
and
one
of
its
early
acts
was
an
extension
of
the
suffrage
by
decreasing
the
amount
of
the
property
qualification
for
voters
the
demand
for
still
further
enlargement
of
popular
rights
became
emphatic
the
people
were
divided
mainly
into
three
parties
and
the
difficulties
confronting
the
king
were
formidable
the
conservatives
who
had
placed
him
in
power
wished
to
prevent
further
changes
in
the
state
the
moderates
asked
for
new
reforms
especially
for
a
still
more
extended
suffrage
the
radical
party
desired
a
republic
the
attitude
of
the
radicals
caused
louis
philippe
to
halt
in
his
progressive
policy
more
than
once
his
life
was
attempted
and
in
consequence
of
such
acts
the
liberty
of
the
press
and
other
privileges
were
restricted
the
greater
part
of
the
french
people
wished
to
have
the
king
intervene
in
behalf
of
poland
which
at
that
period
was
in
a
state
of
almost
chronic
insurrection
as
he
had
aided
the
belgians
against
holland
in
her
eastern
policy
france
was
defeated
by
the
quadruple
alliance
formed
by
england
prussia
austria
and
russia
and
in
consequence
of
this
failure
the
king
prestige
suffered
but
the
question
of
extending
the
suffrage
was
kept
always
before
the
people
and
when
the
king
refused
to
go
further
with
that
reform
its
advocates
urged
their
demands
more
strongly
than
ever
lamartine
founded
a
journal
in
which
he
agitated
for
universal
suffrage
and
in
this
agitation
many
other
newspapers
joined
even
thiers
the
leading
statesman
of
the
moderate
party
asked
for
suffrage
reform
failing
to
control
the
legislative
assembly
the
reformers
at
last
appealed
to
the
people
the
king
relying
on
his
majority
in
the
assembly
was
undisturbed
by
the
popular
ferment
guizot
whose
account
of
the
february
revolution
is
here
given
was
the
chief
minister
of
louis
philippe
and
however
partisan
the
narrative
may
seem
it
rests
upon
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
events
recorded
i
come
with
profound
repugnance
and
sorrow
to
those
painful
days
by
the
faults
and
misfortunes
of
which
france
was
launched
into
dangerous
enterprises
such
that
men
of
the
greatest
foresight
could
not
discern
their
end
our
country
has
paid
very
dearly
for
the
fatal
error
which
overthrew
the
throne
of
the
king
who
had
for
eighteen
years
governed
it
with
a
wisdom
prudence
and
moderation
acknowledged
even
by
his
enemies
when
attacking
him
the
cabinet
of
october
and
its
political
friends
had
a
clearly
defined
idea
and
purpose
they
aspired
to
bring
to
a
close
the
french
era
of
revolutions
by
establishing
the
free
government
which
france
had
in
promised
herself
as
the
consequence
and
political
guarantee
of
the
social
revolution
which
she
was
completing
this
policy
formerly
the
object
of
their
youthful
hopes
had
become
theirs
whether
in
power
or
in
the
opposition
it
was
in
fact
both
liberal
and
antirevolutionary
antirevolutionary
both
in
home
and
foreign
affairs
since
it
wished
to
maintain
the
peace
of
europe
abroad
and
the
constitutional
monarchy
at
home
liberal
since
it
fully
accepted
and
respected
the
essential
conditions
of
free
government
the
decisive
intervention
of
the
country
in
its
affairs
with
a
constant
and
discussion
in
public
as
well
as
in
the
chambers
of
the
ideas
and
acts
of
the
government
in
fact
this
twofold
object
was
attained
from
to
abroad
peace
was
maintained
without
any
loss
to
the
influence
or
reputation
of
france
in
europe
at
home
from
to
political
liberty
was
great
and
powerful
from
to
in
particular
it
was
displayed
without
any
new
legal
limit
being
imposed
it
was
this
policy
that
the
opposition
all
the
oppositions
monarchical
and
dynastic
as
well
as
republican
blindly
or
knowingly
attacked
and
tried
to
change
it
was
to
change
it
that
they
demanded
electoral
and
parliamentary
reforms
in
principle
the
government
had
no
absolute
or
permanent
objections
whatever
to
such
reforms
the
extension
of
the
right
of
suffrage
and
the
incompatibility
of
certain
functions
with
the
office
of
deputy
might
and
must
be
the
natural
and
legitimate
consequences
of
the
upward
movement
of
society
and
political
liberty
they
did
not
think
the
reforms
necessary
or
and
were
therefore
justified
in
delaying
them
as
much
as
possible
provided
they
should
one
day
allow
to
be
accomplished
by
others
what
they
thought
themselves
still
strong
enough
to
refuse
we
have
too
much
and
too
long
maintained
a
good
policy
said
guizot
afterward
a
frequent
and
formidable
sign
that
men
minds
are
secretly
agitated
is
the
anxiety
by
which
they
are
seized
with
reference
to
intrigues
and
vices
which
they
suppose
around
them
it
would
be
a
serious
error
to
see
always
a
symptom
of
moral
improvement
in
the
clamors
against
electoral
or
parliamentary
corruption
immediately
after
the
ministerial
success
in
the
general
elections
of
this
precursory
indication
of
storms
appeared
on
the
horizon
guizot
raised
the
question
to
its
proper
point
of
view
leave
to
countries
which
are
not
free
said
he
leave
to
absolute
governments
that
explanation
of
great
results
by
small
feeble
or
dishonorable
human
acts
in
free
countries
when
great
results
are
produced
it
is
from
great
causes
that
they
spring
a
great
fact
has
been
shown
in
the
elections
just
completed
the
country
has
given
its
adhesion
its
earnest
and
free
adhesion
to
the
policy
presented
before
it
do
not
attribute
this
fact
to
several
pretended
electoral
manoeuvres
you
have
no
right
to
come
to
explain
or
qualify
by
wretched
suppositions
a
grand
idea
of
the
country
thus
grandly
and
freely
manifested
the
rumors
of
electoral
corruptions
were
soon
followed
by
rumors
of
parliamentary
corruptions
but
the
majority
of
the
chamber
declared
themselves
content
with
the
ministerial
explanations
the
contents
figured
in
the
opposition
attacks
by
the
side
of
the
pritchardists
several
improper
abuses
of
long
standing
existed
in
certain
branches
of
the
administration
some
posts
in
the
treasury
had
been
the
object
of
pecuniary
transactions
between
those
who
held
the
posts
and
were
resigning
and
the
candidates
who
presented
themselves
to
replace
them
a
bill
proposed
on
january
by
hébert
who
had
become
keeper
of
the
seals
formally
forbade
any
such
transaction
under
assigned
penalties
several
months
previously
june
teste
formerly
minister
of
public
works
and
then
president
of
the
cour
de
cassation
was
seriously
compromised
in
the
scandalous
trial
of
general
cubières
and
pellapra
convicted
of
having
received
a
large
sum
of
money
in
connection
with
the
mining
concession
he
was
brought
before
the
peers
and
being
led
from
question
to
question
and
from
discussion
to
discussion
soon
made
a
confession
of
his
crime
he
as
well
as
his
accomplices
underwent
the
just
penalty
it
was
on
the
part
of
the
cabinet
one
of
those
acts
the
merit
of
which
is
only
perceived
afterward
and
in
which
the
government
bears
the
weight
of
the
evil
at
the
moment
when
it
is
trying
most
sincerely
and
courageously
to
repress
it
there
were
several
deplorable
incidents
the
shocking
murder
of
the
duchess
of
praslin
some
scandalous
trials
and
violent
deaths
following
hard
one
upon
another
and
aggravating
the
momentary
depression
and
the
excited
state
of
the
popular
imagination
the
air
seemed
infected
with
moral
disorder
and
misfortunes
coming
to
join
in
party
attacks
and
the
false
accusations
which
the
cabinet
were
subjected
to
it
was
one
of
those
unhealthy
hurricanes
often
met
in
the
lives
of
governments
it
was
certainly
culpable
on
the
part
of
the
opposition
to
try
to
take
advantage
of
this
disturbed
state
of
men
minds
to
gain
the
end
they
were
pursuing
seven
times
was
parliamentary
reform
and
three
times
was
electoral
reform
refused
by
the
chambers
from
february
to
april
the
question
being
then
displaced
it
changed
its
ground
the
opposition
made
an
appeal
to
popular
passion
and
parliamentary
discussions
were
succeeded
by
the
banquets
from
the
close
of
the
session
of
to
the
opening
of
that
of
they
kept
france
in
a
state
of
constant
fever
an
artificial
and
deceptive
fever
in
this
sense
that
it
was
not
the
natural
and
spontaneous
result
of
the
actual
wishes
and
wants
of
the
country
but
true
and
serious
in
this
sense
that
the
political
parties
who
took
the
initiative
in
it
found
among
some
of
the
middle
classes
and
the
lower
orders
a
prompt
and
keen
adhesion
to
their
proposals
the
first
banquet
took
place
in
paris
at
the
hôtel
on
july
has
himself
told
how
the
royalist
opposition
and
the
republican
opposition
concluded
their
alliance
for
that
purpose
on
leaving
the
house
of
odilon
barrot
the
radical
members
of
the
meeting
walked
together
for
some
time
on
reaching
that
part
of
the
boulevard
opposite
the
foreign
office
at
the
moment
they
were
about
to
separate
pagnerre
said
well
really
i
did
not
expect
for
our
proposals
so
speedy
and
complete
success
do
those
gentlemen
see
what
that
may
lead
to
for
my
part
i
confess
i
do
not
see
it
clearly
but
it
is
not
for
us
radicals
to
be
alarmed
about
it
you
see
that
tree
replied
engrave
on
its
bark
a
mark
in
memory
of
this
day
for
what
we
have
just
decided
upon
is
a
revolution
did
not
foresee
that
the
republic
of
as
well
as
the
monarchy
of
should
in
its
turn
speedily
perish
in
that
revolution
so
long
big
with
so
many
storms
for
six
months
banquets
were
renewed
in
most
of
the
departments
at
colmar
strasburg
quentin
lille
avesnes
cosne
châlons
mâcon
lyons
montpellier
rouen
etc
in
many
parts
there
was
a
great
display
of
feelings
and
intentions
most
hostile
to
royalty
and
the
dynasty
on
several
occasions
at
lille
for
example
the
keenest
members
of
the
parliamentary
opposition
odilon
barrot
and
his
friends
withdrew
soon
after
taking
their
places
at
table
because
the
others
absolutely
refused
to
dissemble
their
hostility
to
the
crown
and
the
king
at
other
banquets
notably
at
dijon
the
ideas
and
passions
of
unblushingly
reappeared
they
defended
robespierre
and
the
reign
of
terror
the
red
republic
openly
flaunted
its
colors
and
hopes
the
attack
upon
monarchy
and
the
dynasty
ranged
itself
it
is
true
behind
the
parliamentary
opposition
but
like
galatea
running
away
se
cupit
ante
it
had
succeeded
well
enough
in
making
itself
seen
the
government
could
no
longer
shut
their
eyes
they
had
tolerated
the
banquets
so
long
as
they
could
believe
or
seem
to
believe
that
the
parliamentary
opposition
directed
or
at
least
ruled
the
movement
when
it
became
evident
that
the
anarchical
impulse
was
more
and
more
gaining
upon
the
parliamentary
opposition
and
that
the
latter
was
becoming
the
instrument
instead
of
remaining
the
master
then
only
they
forbade
the
banquets
it
was
their
duty
it
was
also
their
right
in
the
opinion
of
the
most
competent
legal
authorities
as
well
as
according
to
the
recent
practice
of
other
free
governments
in
presence
of
a
situation
full
of
certain
danger
this
right
however
was
disputed
by
the
opposition
the
government
pushing
the
principle
of
legality
to
its
furthest
limit
arranged
with
several
leading
men
of
the
opposition
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
question
of
right
to
be
brought
speedily
and
methodically
before
competent
tribunals
just
before
the
opening
of
the
new
session
in
order
to
close
the
campaign
a
new
and
formal
banquet
was
being
prepared
in
paris
to
which
all
the
deputies
and
peers
who
had
taken
part
in
any
of
the
preceding
banquets
were
to
be
invited
this
manifestation
was
to
take
place
in
the
twelfth
arrondissement
of
paris
it
was
therefore
agreed
between
the
opposition
delegates
and
those
of
the
ministerial
majority
that
the
deputies
invited
should
go
to
the
place
appointed
for
the
meeting
and
take
their
places
so
as
to
avoid
any
disturbance
in
the
streets
or
the
hall
and
that
on
the
police
commissary
declaring
that
there
was
an
order
against
it
the
guests
should
protest
and
withdraw
to
lay
the
question
before
the
tribunals
the
agreement
thus
concluded
was
communicated
by
duchâtel
to
the
council
which
approved
of
it
meanwhile
the
chamber
met
the
session
was
opened
and
from
the
very
first
the
government
could
perceive
a
wavering
in
the
majority
even
among
those
who
blamed
and
feared
the
agitation
several
believed
in
the
urgent
necessity
of
a
concession
to
remove
all
pretext
for
clamors
and
intrigues
on
the
ministers
being
informed
of
it
guizot
said
withdraw
the
question
from
the
hands
of
those
who
now
hold
it
and
let
it
be
brought
back
to
the
chamber
let
the
majority
take
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
concessions
indicated
however
small
it
be
i
am
certain
it
will
be
understood
and
that
you
will
have
a
new
cabinet
which
will
do
what
you
think
necessary
it
was
in
the
same
spirit
that
the
ministry
during
the
discussion
on
the
address
rejected
an
amendment
tending
to
impose
upon
them
immediate
engagements
with
reference
to
reform
the
maintenance
of
the
unity
of
the
conservative
party
said
guizot
the
maintenance
of
conservative
policy
and
power
will
be
the
fixed
idea
and
rule
of
conduct
in
the
cabinet
they
will
make
sincere
efforts
to
maintain
or
restore
the
unity
of
the
conservative
party
upon
that
question
in
order
that
it
may
be
the
conservative
party
itself
in
its
entirety
that
undertakes
and
gives
to
the
country
its
solution
if
such
an
operation
in
the
midst
of
the
conservative
party
is
possible
it
will
take
place
if
that
is
not
possible
if
by
the
question
of
reforms
the
conservative
party
can
not
succeed
in
making
a
common
arrangement
and
maintaining
the
power
of
the
conservative
policy
the
cabinet
will
leave
to
others
the
sad
task
of
presiding
over
the
disorganization
of
the
conservative
party
and
the
ruin
of
its
policy
the
question
was
not
destined
to
be
taken
up
again
by
the
chambers
having
escaped
from
the
weak
hands
that
aspired
to
direct
it
the
courtesy
of
the
conservative
reformers
had
no
result
except
disquieting
the
government
a
sort
of
precursory
sign
of
the
tempest
even
the
parliamentary
opposition
found
themselves
baffled
in
their
prudent
efforts
a
manifesto
published
in
the
newspaper
organized
a
noisy
demonstration
in
the
streets
though
forbidden
in
the
the
national
guard
being
called
to
arms
by
the
insurrection
and
their
services
arranged
beforehand
the
convention
was
clearly
violated
and
the
legal
appeal
to
the
tribunals
therefore
abandoned
the
revolution
itself
declared
it
would
decide
the
question
in
such
a
situation
sorrowfully
admitted
by
those
who
had
negotiated
the
evening
before
the
government
officially
forbade
the
banquet
the
evening
papers
announced
that
the
deputies
of
the
opposition
had
given
up
the
intention
of
being
present
and
therefore
the
proposed
manifestation
was
deprived
of
all
importance
the
revolutionary
leaders
in
their
turn
declared
that
the
banquet
would
not
take
place
disappointment
increasing
their
irritation
the
parliamentary
opposition
in
a
momentary
resistance
employed
the
remainder
of
their
strength
on
february
deputies
of
the
left
laid
before
the
chamber
a
bill
of
impeachment
against
the
ministry
on
account
of
their
home
and
foreign
policy
during
the
whole
course
of
their
administration
what
would
you
have
them
do
said
to
guizot
an
old
member
of
the
opposition
who
had
no
share
whatever
in
this
act
they
have
just
rendered
the
banquet
abortive
by
declaring
they
would
not
attend
it
and
felt
compelled
to
do
something
to
compensate
for
and
to
some
extent
redeem
that
refusal
weakness
has
a
constraining
power
difficult
to
understand
which
is
not
foreseen
even
by
those
who
give
way
to
it
and
of
this
the
history
of
the
revolution
of
offers
an
eloquent
and
melancholy
example
the
king
as
well
as
his
ministers
still
hoped
that
the
crisis
had
passed
and
that
the
disorder
avoided
on
the
occasion
of
the
banquet
should
not
reappear
under
any
pretext
the
display
of
military
forces
which
had
been
agreed
upon
and
prepared
was
ordered
to
be
suspended
instructions
to
arrest
the
republican
leaders
were
issued
slowly
and
in
but
few
instances
yet
a
secret
agitation
was
indicated
in
several
parts
of
the
capital
there
were
numerous
crowds
on
the
morning
of
the
several
were
attacked
as
the
fermentation
increased
the
streets
were
crowded
with
idle
workmen
people
collected
in
knots
from
curiosity
or
stood
at
their
doors
the
storm
was
in
the
air
evident
both
to
those
who
dreaded
it
and
those
who
were
preparing
to
make
use
of
it
meanwhile
the
appeal
of
the
revolutionary
leaders
to
the
national
guard
had
been
listened
to
many
of
the
parisian
shopkeepers
took
part
in
the
reform
movement
without
well
understanding
it
and
marched
under
the
orders
of
their
dangerous
allies
several
detachments
of
the
seventh
third
second
and
tenth
legions
appeared
in
the
streets
some
in
the
faubourg
antoine
others
marching
to
the
palais
royal
or
the
office
of
the
in
the
rue
le
peletier
and
others
in
the
quarter
shouting
long
live
reform
in
every
street
when
general
jacqueminot
the
of
the
national
guard
ordered
a
general
muster
of
the
legions
a
large
number
of
the
guards
respectable
and
men
did
not
answer
to
the
summons
they
had
no
desire
for
a
revolution
or
reform
forced
from
the
legal
powers
by
insurrection
but
they
shrunk
from
entering
upon
a
struggle
with
soldiers
wearing
their
own
uniform
and
influenced
apparently
by
reasonable
motives
they
remained
in
their
homes
dejected
and
anxious
the
king
was
as
dejected
as
the
parisian
citizens
and
still
more
anxious
for
several
months
he
had
frequently
fallen
into
very
low
spirits
which
was
attributed
to
his
grief
at
the
death
of
his
only
sister
madame
adelaide
of
orleans
whose
life
had
been
always
intimately
associated
with
his
and
who
had
just
expired
december
his
most
intimate
friends
urged
him
to
charm
away
the
crisis
by
changing
his
ministry
he
still
resisted
but
every
hour
less
vigorously
the
cabinet
was
not
even
informed
of
his
perplexities
concessions
forced
by
violence
from
all
the
legal
powers
are
not
a
means
of
safety
said
duchâtel
one
defeat
would
quickly
bring
a
second
in
the
revolution
there
was
not
much
time
between
that
of
june
and
august
and
things
advance
more
quickly
than
in
those
times
events
like
travellers
now
go
by
steam
the
truth
however
was
now
becoming
manifest
both
in
the
king
mind
as
to
the
tendency
of
his
ideas
and
in
the
eyes
of
his
ministers
as
to
the
determination
now
being
formed
in
the
palace
by
the
very
statement
of
the
question
it
was
resolved
upon
guizot
and
duchâtel
thus
expressed
it
to
the
king
it
is
for
your
majesty
to
decide
the
cabinet
is
ready
either
to
defend
to
the
last
the
king
and
conservative
policy
which
we
profess
or
to
accept
without
a
murmur
the
king
determination
to
call
other
men
to
power
at
present
more
than
ever
in
order
to
continue
the
struggle
successfully
the
cabinet
has
need
of
the
king
decided
support
as
soon
as
the
public
should
learn
as
they
inevitably
must
that
the
king
hesitates
the
cabinet
would
lose
all
moral
influence
and
be
unable
to
accomplish
their
task
the
king
seemed
still
in
perplexity
and
said
he
should
prefer
to
abdicate
you
can
not
say
that
my
dear
replied
the
queen
who
was
present
at
the
interview
with
the
dukes
of
nemours
and
montpensier
you
belong
to
france
and
not
to
yourself
that
is
true
said
the
king
as
louis
xvi
had
formerly
said
to
malesherbes
i
am
more
unfortunate
than
the
ministers
i
can
not
resign
the
ministers
then
in
king
louis
philippe
cabinet
had
not
resigned
the
king
having
made
his
decision
said
it
is
with
the
keenest
regret
that
i
separate
myself
from
you
but
necessity
and
the
safety
of
the
monarchy
demand
this
sacrifice
my
will
gives
way
much
time
will
be
needed
to
regain
the
ground
i
am
about
to
lose
there
were
tears
in
many
eyes
the
king
sent
for
molé
and
guizot
himself
announced
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
the
change
of
the
ministry
there
was
much
of
astonishment
and
sorrow
in
the
parliamentary
majority
always
strongly
attached
to
the
leaders
they
had
so
long
followed
in
spite
of
occasional
vagaries
and
weakness
the
imminence
of
a
great
danger
engrossed
their
minds
together
with
the
consciousness
of
a
great
defeat
the
anxiety
of
the
chambers
was
reechoed
in
the
tuileries
and
for
the
last
time
the
ministers
assembled
there
anxious
at
that
last
moment
of
their
power
to
maintain
order
now
everywhere
threatened
count
molé
was
laboriously
occupied
in
the
formation
of
a
cabinet
to
think
that
this
resolution
was
formed
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
exclaimed
the
king
when
engaged
with
jayr
in
some
administrative
details
the
excitement
was
great
in
the
palace
but
still
greater
in
the
streets
being
skilfully
kept
up
by
several
insurrectionist
leaders
and
spontaneously
arising
among
the
reckless
portion
of
the
populace
who
are
easily
influenced
by
revolutionary
clamors
increased
by
those
assembling
from
curiosity
or
idleness
the
crowds
in
the
squares
and
boulevards
assumed
alarming
proportions
all
at
once
opposite
the
foreign
office
there
was
heard
about
nine
in
the
evening
one
of
those
fatal
explosions
whether
accidental
or
premeditated
which
history
often
records
as
the
origin
of
great
popular
risings
the
soldiers
who
till
then
had
remained
motionless
and
patient
thought
they
were
attacked
and
fired
in
their
turn
several
persons
fell
some
dead
others
wounded
and
some
were
knocked
down
and
trodden
under
foot
the
greatest
disorder
caused
both
by
alarm
and
indignation
broke
out
in
the
whole
neighborhood
then
was
the
moment
of
action
for
the
keen
and
determined
insurgents
a
cart
which
happened
to
be
there
was
immediately
loaded
with
the
corpses
and
drawn
through
the
streets
from
one
newspaper
office
to
another
in
the
most
populous
quarters
with
shouts
of
vengeance
to
arms
down
with
guizot
the
head
of
guizot
by
daybreak
paris
was
covered
with
barricades
molé
having
failed
in
his
efforts
to
form
a
cabinet
the
king
sent
for
thiers
for
the
last
time
he
claimed
the
devotion
of
his
old
ministers
i
must
have
immediately
a
military
chief
an
experienced
chief
he
said
i
have
sent
for
bugeaud
but
i
wish
thiers
to
find
him
appointed
will
you
grant
me
this
further
service
duchâtel
and
general
trézel
on
the
previous
evening
still
minister
of
war
signed
without
hesitation
marshal
bugeaud
appointment
as
of
the
national
guard
and
the
army
it
was
three
in
the
morning
it
is
somewhat
late
to
set
to
work
said
the
marshal
but
i
have
never
been
beaten
and
shall
not
make
a
beginning
let
me
act
and
fire
the
cannon
there
will
be
some
bloodshed
but
evening
the
strength
will
be
on
the
side
of
law
and
the
factious
will
have
had
their
account
settled
the
day
had
not
yet
dawned
when
the
marshal
was
reviewing
his
forces
he
found
them
demoralized
having
for
sixty
hours
remained
motionless
before
the
mob
with
their
feet
in
the
mud
and
their
knapsacks
on
their
backs
allowing
the
rioters
to
attack
the
municipal
guard
burn
the
cut
down
the
trees
break
the
and
harangue
the
soldiers
they
were
moreover
badly
supplied
with
provisions
and
ammunition
the
energetic
language
of
their
new
commander
and
the
precise
orders
which
he
gave
for
the
march
of
the
columns
inspired
the
soldiers
with
fresh
life
and
courage
the
movements
indicated
had
already
begun
to
be
executed
and
the
troops
were
taking
position
but
the
crowds
again
filled
the
streets
and
at
several
points
the
soldiers
were
prevented
from
marching
one
of
the
generals
at
the
head
of
a
column
sent
to
tell
bugeaud
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
an
enormous
body
of
men
badly
armed
who
made
no
attack
upon
him
but
only
shouted
long
live
reform
long
live
the
army
down
with
guizot
order
them
to
disperse
replied
the
marshal
if
they
do
not
obey
use
force
and
act
with
resolution
there
was
no
fighting
on
either
side
the
staff
were
besieged
by
the
entreaties
of
a
crowd
of
respectable
men
who
in
terror
and
consternation
conjured
bugeaud
to
withdraw
the
troops
because
they
excited
the
anger
of
the
populace
and
leave
to
the
national
guard
the
duty
of
appeasing
the
insurrection
the
danger
of
such
counsel
was
obvious
and
the
marshal
paid
no
attention
to
it
till
thiers
and
odilon
barrot
who
had
just
accepted
office
came
to
the
staff
with
the
same
advice
and
it
therefore
became
an
order
the
marshal
at
first
refused
the
ministers
as
he
had
done
the
citizens
and
then
the
same
order
was
sent
by
the
king
i
must
have
a
government
the
marshal
had
recently
said
and
as
he
was
now
without
the
government
which
thus
relaxed
the
resistance
agreed
upon
he
in
his
turn
gave
way
his
instructions
for
retreat
were
thus
given
to
his
officers
by
order
of
the
king
and
ministers
you
will
fall
back
upon
the
tuileries
make
your
retreat
with
an
imposing
attitude
and
if
you
are
attacked
turn
round
take
the
offensive
and
act
according
to
my
instructions
given
this
morning
meanwhile
the
formation
of
the
ministry
was
posted
up
everywhere
a
mixed
crowd
carried
odilon
barrot
in
triumph
to
the
home
office
which
guizot
and
duchâtel
had
just
left
those
round
him
shouted
long
live
the
father
of
the
people
but
most
of
the
notices
posted
up
were
torn
at
the
moment
when
the
new
ministers
were
about
to
leave
bugeaud
staff
on
horseback
in
order
to
pass
through
the
city
horace
vernet
the
artist
arrived
out
of
breath
do
let
thiers
go
said
he
to
the
marshal
i
have
just
passed
through
the
mob
and
they
are
so
furious
against
him
that
i
am
certain
they
would
cut
him
in
pieces
odilon
barrot
presented
himself
alone
to
the
crowd
but
was
powerless
to
calm
the
fury
he
had
assisted
in
unchaining
thiers
is
no
longer
possible
and
i
am
scarcely
so
said
he
on
his
return
to
the
staff
the
king
on
one
occasion
showed
himself
in
the
court
of
the
tuileries
when
reviewing
several
battalions
of
the
national
guard
there
were
some
shouts
of
long
live
the
king
but
the
most
numerous
were
long
live
reform
down
with
guizot
you
have
the
reform
and
guizot
is
no
longer
a
minister
said
the
king
and
on
the
shouts
being
again
repeated
he
returned
to
the
palace
the
palace
also
was
thronged
with
a
confused
crowd
animated
by
various
feelings
and
agitated
by
evident
fears
or
secret
hopes
some
urged
the
king
to
abdicate
in
favor
of
the
comte
de
paris
others
vigorously
opposed
such
a
relinquishment
of
power
in
presence
of
the
insurrection
the
great
mind
of
queen
was
displayed
in
all
the
simplicity
of
its
heroism
mount
on
horseback
sire
said
she
and
i
shall
give
you
my
blessing
she
had
recently
urged
the
king
to
change
his
cabinet
a
very
kind
message
intrusted
for
guizot
to
one
of
his
most
intimate
friends
at
the
same
time
proved
her
regret
the
king
sat
at
his
agitated
and
perplexed
he
had
begun
to
write
his
abdication
when
marshal
bugeaud
entered
having
just
learned
what
was
taking
place
in
the
tuileries
and
excited
by
the
sound
of
some
shooting
which
had
already
begun
it
is
too
late
sire
said
he
your
abdication
would
complete
the
demoralization
of
the
troops
your
majesty
can
hear
the
shooting
there
is
nothing
left
but
to
fight
the
queen
seconded
this
advice
and
piscatory
and
several
others
were
of
the
same
opinion
the
king
rose
without
finishing
his
writing
and
then
other
voices
were
raised
to
insist
upon
the
king
promise
he
sat
down
again
wrote
and
signed
his
abdication
by
this
time
the
troops
had
received
orders
to
fall
back
and
marshal
gérard
took
the
place
of
bugeaud
as
the
columns
were
marched
toward
the
barracks
and
there
was
no
detachment
around
the
where
the
same
disorder
reigned
and
the
same
efforts
were
made
in
vain
the
duchesse
presented
herself
before
the
chamber
of
deputies
as
soon
as
the
abdication
of
the
king
was
known
the
duc
de
nemours
accompanied
her
leading
the
comte
de
paris
by
the
hand
and
the
duc
de
chartres
who
was
weak
and
ill
was
wrapped
up
in
a
mantle
and
leaned
on
ary
scheffer
arm
before
joining
the
princess
at
the
gate
of
the
chamber
the
duc
de
nemours
had
with
his
brother
the
duc
de
montpensier
seen
the
king
their
father
take
his
melancholy
departure
to
escape
the
insurrection
against
which
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
use
force
the
duchesse
already
knew
that
depriving
the
king
of
the
crown
was
not
giving
it
to
her
son
her
natural
courage
however
and
her
maternal
affection
induced
her
to
make
every
effort
to
secure
the
throne
for
the
prince
of
nine
years
whom
the
nation
had
already
intrusted
to
her
keeping
she
had
seen
the
tuileries
invaded
before
leaving
that
hall
where
her
husband
portrait
by
ingres
seemed
to
preside
over
her
destinies
it
is
here
one
ought
to
die
she
said
when
dupin
and
grammont
came
to
conduct
her
to
the
chamber
odilon
barret
had
gone
to
bring
her
and
succeeded
in
finding
her
in
the
the
crowd
showed
sympathy
for
her
and
made
room
respectfully
though
she
and
her
small
retinue
had
difficulty
in
getting
within
the
palace
every
passage
being
crowded
the
duchess
stood
near
the
tribune
holding
her
two
boys
close
to
her
after
dupin
announced
the
king
abdication
barrot
after
presenting
the
legal
instrument
asked
the
chamber
to
proclaim
at
once
the
young
king
and
the
regency
of
madame
la
duchesse
shouts
of
protest
were
heard
on
several
benches
it
is
too
late
exclaimed
lamartine
as
he
went
to
the
tribune
eager
to
urge
this
difficulty
reject
the
regency
and
demand
a
provisional
government
so
that
the
bloodshed
might
be
stopped
some
others
were
already
mentioning
the
word
republic
the
crowd
were
gradually
pouring
into
the
chamber
from
the
corriders
and
sauzet
the
president
requested
strangers
to
withdraw
and
made
a
special
appeal
to
the
duchess
herself
sir
this
is
a
royal
sitting
she
replied
and
when
her
friends
urged
her
if
i
leave
this
chamber
my
son
will
no
more
return
to
it
a
few
minutes
before
her
arrival
thiers
had
entered
the
chamber
in
the
greatest
agitation
the
tide
is
rising
rising
rising
he
said
to
those
who
crowded
round
him
and
then
disappeared
several
voices
were
heard
together
in
confusion
among
the
speakers
were
la
rochejacquelein
marie
and
berryer
the
duchess
had
been
conducted
to
a
gallery
on
account
of
the
threats
of
the
insurgent
battalions
who
burst
open
the
doors
after
general
gourgaud
had
in

tried
to
stop

one
of
the
editors
of

after
looking
at
the
invaders
said
these
are
the
sham
public
i
shall
call
the
real
a
few
minutes
afterward
shots
were
heard
in
the
court
of
the
palace
the
posts
in
the
hands
of
the
national
guard
opened
before
the
triumphant
mob
who
after
sacking
the
tuileries
hurried
up
against
the
expiring
remnants
of
the
monarchy
the
duchesse
had
already
twice
offered
to
speak
but
her
voice
was
drowned
in
the
tumult
the
newcomers
stained
with
blood
and
blackened
with
gunpowder
with
dishevelled
hair
and
bare
arms
climbed
on
the
benches
stairs
and
galleries
and
in
every
part
were
shouts

learned
at
the

time
the
news
of

the
rise

it
their

bow
to
the
national

that
not
a

should
be

revolutionary
movements
in
germany
edmund
maurice
popular
demonstrations
in
various
parts
of
germany
in
the
great
revolutionary
year
were
no
doubt
partly
due
to
the
outbreaks
in
france
and
elsewhere
but
it
is
also
apparent
that
discontent
at
home
had
been
long
turning
the
people
toward
revolt
the
agitation
that
began
in
march
the
month
following
the
february
revolution
and
the
declaration
of
a
republic
in
france
was
the
work
of
a
patriotic
party
that
cherished
not
only
aspirations
for
extending
popular
rights
in
the
several
states
but
also
a
prophetic
desire
for
german
unity
the
congress
of
vienna
attempted
to
adjust
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
some
sort
of
union
for
the
states
was
imperatively
required
by
the
general
situation
but
there
was
fear
of
making
germany
too
strong
the
congress
created
the
german
confederation
constituted
by
a
union
of
independent
states
under
the
hegemony
or
political
headship
of
austria
this
confederation
lacked
strength
in
the
central
government
and
although
it
reduced
the
number
of
states
from
more
than
three
hundred
to
it
still
perpetuated
elements
of
unwieldiness
and
discord
at
the
head
of
the
austrian
government
as
chief
minister
of
the
emperor
ferdinand
i
was
metternich
who
for
many
years
had
been
the
great
reactionary
leader
of
europe
he
was
compelled
now
to
face
conditions
such
as
in
his
long
and
varied
career
of
statecraft
and
diplomacy
he
never
had
confronted
ferdinand
himself
always
a
weak
ruler
succumbed
to
the
revolution
provoked
by
his

downfall
was
followed
by

of

the
most
interesting
of

was
that
in

robert
blum

blum
born
at
cologne
in
was
a
writer
and
an
agitator
leader
of
the
liberal
party
in
saxony
he
was
executed
in
november
ed
was
present
at
a
ball
in
leipsic
when
the
news
arrived
of
the
french
revolution
he
at
once
hastened
to
consult
his
friends
and
they
agreed
to
act
through
the
town
council
of
leipsic
and
sketched
out
the
demands
that
they
desired
should
be
laid
before
the
king
these
were
a
reorganization
of
the
constitution
of
the
german
bund
in
the
spirit
and
in
accordance
with
the
needs
of
the
times
for
which
the
way
is
to
be
prepared
by
the
unfettering
of
the
press
and
the
summoning
of
representatives
of
all
german
peoples
to
the
assembly
of

adopted
this

on

it
to

people
gathered
to
meet
the
deputation
on
its
return
the
following
is
the
account
given
by
the
son
of
robert
blum
by
anonymous
placards
on
the
wall
the
population
of
leipsic
was
summoned
on
the
evening
of
march
to
meet
at
the
railway
station
the
deputation
returning
from
dresden
since
the
space
was
too
narrow
in
this
place
the
innumerable
mass
marched
to
the
which
as
well
as
the
neighboring
streets
they
completely
filled
in
perfect
silence
the
thousands
awaited
here
the
arrival
of
the
deputation
which
at
last
toward
nine
arrived
and
was
greeted
with
unceasing
applause
town
councillor
seeburg
spoke
first
of
the
deep
emotion
of
the
king
after
him
spoke
biedermann
but
the
crowd
uproariously
demanded
robert
blum
at
last
blum
appeared
on
the
balcony
of
the
town
council
house
his
voice
alone
controlled
the
whole
and
was
even
heard
in
the
neighboring
streets
he
too
sought
by
trying
to
quiet
them
to
turn
them
away
from
the
subject
of
the
address
and
of
the
king
answer
but
the
people
broke
uproariously
into
his
speech
with
the
demand
answer
the
answer
it
could
no
longer
be
concealed
that
the
petitions
of
the
town
had
received
harsh
rejection
then
came
a
loud
and
passionate
murmur
the
masses
had
firmly
hoped
that
the
deputation
would
bring
with
them
from
dresden
the
news
of
the
dismissal
of
the
hated
ministers
but
blum
continued
his
speech
and
they
renewed
their
attention
to
him
constitutional
countries
said
he
is
not
the
king
but
the
ministers
who
are
responsible
they
too
bear
the
responsibility
of
the
rejection
of
the
leipsic
proposals
the
people
must
press
for
their
removal
he
added
that
he
would
bring
forward
in
the
next
meeting
of
the
town
representatives
the
proposal
that
the
king
should
dismiss
the
ministry
does
not
possess
the
confidence
of
the
people
amid
shouts
of
exultation
and
applause
the
appeased
assembly
dispersed
blum
was
as
successful
with
his
colleagues
as
with
the
crowd
and
the
town
council
now
demanded
from
the
king
the
dismissal
of
his
ministers
the
meeting
of
the
assembly
and
freedom
of
the
press
the
king
tried
to
resist
the
last
of
these
three
proposals
pleading
his
duty
to
the
bund
but
even
the
bundestag
had
felt
the
spirit
of
the
times
and
on
march
had
passed
a
resolution
giving
leave
to
every
government
to
abolish
the
censorship
of
the
press
the
king
seemed
to
yield
and
promised
to
fulfil
all
that
was
wished
but
the
reactionary
party
in
dresden
had
become
alarmed
at
the
action
of
the
men
of
leipsic
and
so
on
march
when
the
men
of
leipsic
supposed
that
all
was
granted
general
von
carlowitz
entered
their
city
at
the
head
of
a
strong
force
and
demanded
that
the
town
council
should
abstain
from
exciting
speeches
that
the
elocution
union
should
give
up
all
political
discussion
that
the
processions
of
people
should
cease
and
above
all
that
the
march
from
leipsic
to
dresden
which
was
believed
to
be
then
intended
should
be
given
up
these
demands
were
met
by
blum
with
an
indignant
protest
five
men
said
he
who
manage
the
army
can
not
understand
that
though
their
bullets
may
kill
men
they
can
not
make
a
single
hole
in
the
idea
that
rules
the
world
the
town
councillors
of
leipsic
were
equally
firm
carlowitz
abandoned
his
attempt
as
hopeless
and
on
march
the
king
summoned
a
liberal
ministry
which
abolished
press
censorship
granted
publicity
of
legal
proceedings
trial
by
jury
and
a
wider
basis
for
the
saxon
parliament
and
promised
to
assist
in
the
reform
of
the
bund
in
the
mean
time
the
success
of
the
french
revolution
had
awakened
new
hopes
in
vienna
soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
news
a
placard
appeared
on
one
of
the
city
gates
bearing
the
words
in
a
month
prince
metternich
will
be
overthrown
long
live
constitutional
austria
metternich
himself
was
greatly
alarmed
and
began
to
listen
to
proposals
for
extending
the
power
of
the
lower
austrian
estates
yet
he
still
hoped
by
talking
over
and
discussing
these
matters
to
delay
the
execution
of
reforms
till
a
more
favorable
turn
in
affairs
should
render
them
either
harmless
or
unnecessary
but
great
as
was
the
alarm
caused
by
the
south
german
risings
and
great
as
were
the
hopes
which
they
kindled
in
the
viennese
the
word
that
was
to
give
definiteness
and
importance
to
the
impulses
that
were
stirring
in
vienna
could
not
come
from
bavaria
or
saxony
much
as
they
might
wish
to
connect
themselves
with
a
german
movement
the
viennese
could
not
get
rid
of
the
fact
that
they
were
for
the
present
bound
up
with
a
different
political
system
nor
was
it
wholly
clear
that
the
german
movement
was
as
yet
completely
successful
the
king
of
prussia
seemed
to
be
meditating
a
reactionary
policy
and
had
even
threatened
to
despatch
troops
to
put
down
the
saxon
liberals
and
the
king
of
hanover
also
was
disposed
to
resist
the
movement
for
a
german
parliament
it
was
from
a
country
more
closely
bound
up
with
the
viennese
government
and
yet
enjoying
traditions
of
more
deeply
rooted
liberty
that
the
utterance
was
to
come
which
was
eventually
to
rouse
the
viennese
to
action
the
readiness
of
the
nobles
to
accept
the
purely
verbal
concession
offered
by
metternich
in
the
matter
of
the
administrators
had
shown
kossuth
footnote
louis
kossuth
the
famous
leader
of
the
hungarian
insurrection
of
was
at
this
time
about
years
of
age
the
sovereignty
of
hungary
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
hapsburgs
since
ed
that
there
could
be
no
further
peace
but
he
still
knew
how
and
when
to
strike
the
blow
and
it
was
not
by
armed
insurrection
so
much
as
by
the
declaration
of
a
policy
that
he
shook
the
rule
of
metternich
on
march
a
conservative
member
of
the
presburg
assembly
brought
forward
a
motion
for
inquiry
into
the
austrian
kossuth
answered
that
the
confusion
in
the
affairs
of
austrian
commerce
produced
an
evil
effect
on
hungarian
finances
and
he
showed
the
need
of
an
independent
finance
ministry
for
hungary
then
he
went
on
to
point
out
that
this
same
confusion
extended
to
other
parts
of
the
monarchy
the
actual
cause
of
the
breaking
up
of
peace
in
the
monarchy
and
of
all
the
evils
which
may
possibly
follow
from
it
lies
in
the
system
of
government
he
admitted
that
it
was
hard
for
those
who
had
been
brought
up
under
this
system
to
consent
to
its
destruction
but
he
went
on
the
people
lasts
forever
and
we
wish
also
that
the
country
of
the
people
should
last
forever
forever
too
should
last
the
splendor
of
that
dynasty
whose
representatives
we
reckon
as
our
rulers
in
a
few
days
the
men
of
the
past
will
descend
into
their
graves
but
for
that
scion
of
the
house
of
hapsburg
who
excites
such
great
hopes
for
the
archduke
francis
joseph
who
at
his
first
coming
forward
earned
the
love
of
the
nation
for
him
there
waits
the
inheritance
of
a
splendid
throne
which
derives
its
strength
from
freedom
toward
a
dynasty
which
bases
itself
on
the
freedoms
of
its
people
enthusiasm
will
always
be
roused
for
it
is
only
the
freeman
who
can
be
faithful
from
his
heart
for
a
bureaucracy
there
can
be
no
enthusiasm
he
then
urged
that
the
future
of
the
dynasty
depended
on
the
hearty
union
between
the
nations
which
lived
under
it
this
union
he
said
can
be
brought
about
only
by
respecting
the
nationalities
and
by
that
bond
of
constitutionalism
which
can
produce
a
kindred
feeling
the
bureau
and
the
bayonet
are
miserable
bonds
he
then
went
on
to
apologize
for
not
examining
the
difficulties
between
hungary
and
croatia
the
solution
of
the
difficulties
of
the
empire
would
he
held
solve
the
croatian
question
too
if
it
did
not
he
promised
to
consider
that
question
with
sympathy
and
examine
it
in
all
its
details
he
concluded
by
proposing
an
address
to
the
emperor
which
should
point
out
that
it
was
the
want
of
constitutional
life
in
the
whole
empire
which
hindered
the
progress
of
hungary
and
that
while
an
independent
government
and
a
separate
responsible
ministry
were
absolutely
essential
to
hungary
it
was
also
necessary
that
the
emperor
should
surround
his
throne
in
all
matters
of
the
government
with
such
constitutional
arrangements
as
were
indispensably
demanded
by
the
needs
of
the
time
this
utterance
has
been
called
the
baptismal
speech
of
the
revolution
coming
as
it
did
directly
after
the
news
of
the
french
revolution
it
gave
a
definiteness
to
the
growing
demands
for
freedom
but
it
did
more
than
this
metternich
had
cherished
a
growing
hope
that
the
demand
for
constitutional
government
in
vienna
might
be
gradually
used
to
crush
out
the
independent
position
of
hungary
by
absorbing
the
hungarians
in
a
common
austrian
parliament
and
he
had
looked
upon
a
croatian
question
as
a
means
for
still
further
weakening
the
power
of
the
hungarian
diet
kossuth
speech
struck
a
blow
at
these
hopes
by
declaring
that
freedom
for
any
part
of
the
empire
could
be
obtained
only
by
working
for
the
freedom
of
the
whole
he
swept
aside
for
the
moment
those
national
and
provincial
jealousies
which
were
the
great
strength
of
the
austrian
despotism
and
appealed
to
all
the
liberals
of
the
empire
to
unite
against
the
system
which
was
oppressing
them
all
had
kossuth
remained
true
to
the
faith
which
he
proclaimed
in
this
speech
it
is
within
the
limits
of
probability
that
the
whole
revolution
of
might
have
had
a
different
result
the
hungarian
chancellor
mailath
was
so
alarmed
at
kossuth
speech
that
he
hindered
the
setting
out
of
the
deputation
which
was
to
have
presented
the
address
to
the
emperor
but
he
could
not
prevent
the
speech
from
producing
its
effect
although
presburg
was
only
six
journey
from
vienna
the
route
had
been
made
so
difficult
that
the
news
of
anything
done
in
the
hungarian
diet
had
hitherto
reached
vienna
in
a
roundabout
manner
and
had
sometimes
been
a
week
on
its
way
the
news
of
this
speech
however
arrived
on
the
very
next
day
and
kossuth
friend
pulszky
immediately
translated
it
into
german
and
circulated
it
among
the
viennese
a
rumor
of
its
contents
had
spread
before
the
actual
speech
it
was
said
that
kossuth
had
declared
war
against
the
system
of
government
and
that
he
had
said
state
bankruptcy
was
inevitable
but
as
the
news
became
more
definite
the
minds
of
the
viennese
fixed
upon
two
points
the
denunciation
of
the
men
of
the
past
and
the
demand
for
a
constitution
for
austria
so
alarmed
did
the
government
become
at
the
effect
of
this
speech
that
they
undertook
to
answer
it
in
an
official
paper
the
writer
of
this
answer
called
attention
to
the
terrible
scenes
which
he
said
were
being
enacted
in
paris
which
proved
according
to
him
that
the
only
safety
for
the
governed
was
in
rallying
round
the
government
this
utterance
naturally
excited
only
contempt
and
disgust
and
the
news
of
new
constitutions
granted
in
germany
swelled
the
enthusiasm
which
had
been
roused
by
kossuth
speech
the
movement
still
centred
in
the
professors
of
the
university
on
march
doctor
loehner
had
proposed
at
one
of
the
meetings
of
the
reading
and
debating
society
that
negotiations
should
be
opened
with
the
estates
and
that
they
should
be
urged
to
declare
their
assembly
permanent
the
country
in
danger
and
metternich
a
public
enemy
this
proposal
marked
a
definite
step
in
constitutional
progress
the
estates
of
lower
austria
which
met
in
vienna
had
indeed
from
time
to
time
expressed
their
opinions
on
certain
public
grievances
but
these
opinions
had
been
generally
disregarded
by
francis
and
metternich
and
though
the
latter
had
of
late
talked
of
enlarging
the
powers
of
the
estates
he
had
evidently
intended
such
words
partly
as
mere
talk
in
order
to
delay
any
efficient
action
and
partly
as
a
bid
against
the
concessions
which
had
been
made
by
the
king
of
prussia
that
the
leaders
of
a
popular
movement
should
suggest
an
appeal
to
the
estates
of
lower
austria
was
therefore
an
unexpected
sign
of
a
desire
to
find
any
legal
centre
for
action
however
weak
in
power
and
however
aristocratic
that
centre
might
be
doctor
loehner
proposal
however
does
not
seem
to
have
been
generally
adopted
and
instead
of
the
suggested
appeal
to
the
estates
a
programme
of
eleven
points
was
circulated
by
the
debating
society
when
we
consider
that
the
revolution
broke
out
in
less
than
a
fortnight
after
this
petition
we
can
not
but
be
struck
with
the
extreme
moderation
of
the
demands
now
made
most
of
the
eleven
points
were
concerned
with
proposals
for
the
removal
either
of
forms
of
corruption
or
of
restraints
on
personal
liberty
and
they
were
directed
chiefly
against
those
interferences
with
the
life
and
teaching
of
the
universities
which
were
causing
so
much
bitterness
in
vienna
such
demands
for
constitutional
reforms
as
were
contained
in
this
programme
were
certainly
not
of
an
alarming
character
the
petitioners
asked
that
the
right
of
election
to
the
assembly
of
estates
should
be
extended
to
citizens
and
peasants
that
the
deliberative
powers
of
the
estates
should
be
enlarged
and
that
the
whole
empire
should
be
represented
in
an
assembly
for
which
however
the
petitioners
asked
only
a
consultative
power
perhaps
the
three
demands
in
this
petition
which
would
have
excited
the
widest
sympathy
were
those
in
favor
of
the
universal
arming
of
the
people
the
universal
right
of
petition
and
the
abolition
of
the
censorship
the
expression
of
desire
for
reform
now
became
much
more
general
and
even
some
members
of
the
estates
prepared
an
appeal
to
their
colleagues
against
the
bureaucratic
system
but
the
character
and
tone
of
the
utterances
of
these
new
reformers
somewhat
weakened
the
effect
which
had
been
produced
by
the
bolder
complaints
of
the
earlier
leaders
of
the
movement
for
while
the
students
of
the
university
and
some
of
their
professors
still
showed
a
desire
for
bold
and
independent
action
the
merchants
caught
eagerly
at
the
sympathy
of
the
archduke
francis
charles
while
the
booksellers
addressed
to
the
emperor
a
petition
in
which
servility
passes
into
blasphemy
these
signs
of
weakness
were
no
doubt
observed
by
the
government
and
it
was
not
wonderful
that
under
these
circumstances
metternich
and
kolowrat
should
have
been
able
to
persuade
themselves
that
they
could
still
play
with
the
viennese
and
put
them
off
with
promises
which
need
never
be
fulfilled
archduke
louis
alone
seems
to
have
foreseen
the
coming
storm
but
was
unable
to
persuade
his
colleagues
to
make
military
preparations
to
meet
it
in
the
mean
time
the
movement
among
the
students
was
assuming
more
decided
proportions
and
their
demands
related
as
usual
to
the
great
questions
of
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
teaching
and
to
these
were
added
the
demand
for
popular
representation
the
justifications
for
which
they
drew
from
kossuth
speech
of
march
but
while
hungary
supplied
the
model
of
constitutional
government
the
hope
for
a
wider
national
life
connected
itself
more
and
more
with
the
idea
of
a
united
germany
two
days
after
the
delivery
of
speech
an
impulse
had
been
given
to
this
latter
feeling
by
the
meeting
at
heidelberg
of
the
leading
supporters
of
german
unity
and
they
had
elected
a
committee
of
seven
to
prepare
the
way
for
a
constituent
assembly
at
frankfort
of
these
seven
two
came
from
baden
one
from
wurtemberg
one
from
one
from
prussia
one
from
bavaria
and
one
from
frankfort
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
south
germany
still
kept
the
lead
in
the
movement
for
german
unity
and
the
president
of
the
committee
was
that
izstein
of
baden
who
had
been
known
to
germany
chiefly
by
his
expulsion
from
berlin
but
though
this
distribution
of
power
augured
ill
for
the
relations
between
the
leaders
of
the
german
movement
and
the
king
of
prussia
the
meeting
at
heidelberg
was
not
prepared
to
adopt
the
complete
programme
of
the
baden
leaders
nor
to
commit
itself
to
that
republican
movement
which
would
probably
have
repelled
the
north
german
liberals
the
chief
leader
of
the
more
moderate
party
in
the
meeting
was
heinrich
von
gagern
the
representative
of
gagern
was
the
son
of
a
former
minister
of
the
grand
duke
of
nassau
who
had
left
that
state
to
take
service
in
austria
and
who
had
acted
with
the
archduke
john
in
planning
a
popular
rising
in
the
tyrol
in
heinrich
had
been
trained
at
a
military
school
in
munich
he
had
steadily
opposed
the
policy
of
metternich
had
done
his
best
to
induce
the
universities
to
in
a
common
german
movement
and
had
tried
to
secure
internal
liberties
for
while
he
had
urged
his
countrymen
to
look
for
the
model
of
a
free
constitution
rather
to
england
and
hungary
than
to
france
during
the
constitutional
movement
of
he
had
become
prime
minister
of
and
he
seems
to
have
had
considerable
power
of
winning
popular
confidence
although
he
was
not
able
to
commit
the
meeting
to
a
definitely
monarchical
policy
he
had
influence
enough
to
counteract
the
attempts
of
struve
and
hecker
to
carry
a
proposal
for
the
proclamation
of
a
republic
and
his
influence
increased
during
the
later
phases
of
the
movement
it
was
obvious
that
in
the
state
of
viennese
feeling
a
movement
in
favor
of
german
unity
at
once
so
determined
and
so
moderate
in
its
character
would
give
new
impulse
to
the
hopes
for
freedom
already
excited
by
kossuth
speech
and
the
action
of
the
reformers
now
became
more
vigorous
because
the
students
rather
than
the
professors
were
guiding
the
movement
some
of
the
latter
and
particularly
professor
hye
were
beginning
to
be
alarmed
and
were
attempting
to
hold
their
pupils
in
check
this
roused
the
distrust
and
suspicion
of
the
students
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
professors
hye
and
endlicher
could
prevail
on
the
younger
leaders
of
the
movement
to
abstain
from
action
until
the
professors
had
laid
before
the
emperor
the
desire
of
the
university
for
the
removal
of
metternich
this
deputation
waited
on
the
emperor
on
march
but
it
proved
of
little
avail
and
when
the
professors
returned
with
the
answer
that
the
emperor
would
consider
their
wishes
the
students
received
them
with
laughter
and
resolved
to
take
the
matter
into
their
own
hands
the
next
day
was
to
be
the
opening
of
the
assembly
of
the
estates
of
lower
austria
and
the
students
of
vienna
resolved
to
march
from
the
university
to
the
landhaus
in
the
great
hall
of
the
university
now
hidden
away
in
an
obscure
part
of
vienna
but
still
retaining
traces
of
the
paintings
which
then
decorated
it
the
students
gathered
in
large
numbers
on
march
various
rumors
of
a
discouraging
kind
had
been
circulated
this
and
that
leading
citizen
were
mentioned
as
having
been
arrested
nay
it
was
even
said
that
members
of
the
estates
had
themselves
been
seized
and
that
the
sitting
of
the
assembly
would
not
be
allowed
to
take
place
to
these
rumors
were
added
the
warnings
of
the
professors
fuester
who
had
recently
preached
on
the
duty
of
devotion
to
the
cause
of
the
country
now
endeavored
by
praises
of
the
emperor
to
check
the
desire
of
the
students
for
immediate
action
but
he
was
shouted
down
hye
then
appealed
to
them
to
wait
a
few
days
in
hopes
of
a
further
answer
from
the
emperor
they
answered
with
a
shout
that
they
would
not
wait
an
hour
and
then
they
raised
the
cry
of
landhaus
breaking
loose
from
all
further
restraint
they
set
out
on
their
march
and
as
they
went
numbers
gathered
round
them
the
people
of
vienna
had
already
been
appealed
to
by
a
placard
on
stephen
church
to
free
the
good
emperor
ferdinand
from
his
enemies
and
the
placard
further
declared
that
he
who
wished
for
the
rise
of
austria
must
wish
for
the
fall
of
the
present
ministers
of
state
the
appeal
produced
its
effect
and
the
crowd
grew
dense
as
the
students
marched
into
the
narrow
herren
gasse
they
passed
under
the
archway
which
led
into
the
courtyard
of
the
landhaus
there
in
front
of
the
very
building
where
the
assembly
was
sitting
they
came
to
a
dead
halt
and
with
the
strange
hesitation
which
sometimes
comes
over
crowds
no
man
seemed
to
know
what
was
next
to
be
done
suddenly
in
the
pause
which
followed
the
words
were
heard
from
a
corner
of
the
crowd
it
was
evident
that
some
one
was
trying
to
address
them
and
the
students
nearest
to
the
speaker
hoisted
him
upon
their
shoulders
then
the
crowd
saw
a
man
with
a
round
strong
head
hair
and
a
thick
beard
each
man
eagerly
asked
his
neighbor
who
this
could
be
and
as
the
speech
proceeded
the
news
went
round
that
this
was
doctor
fischhof
a
man
who
had
been
very
little
known
beyond
medical
circles
and
hitherto
looked
upon
as
quite
outside
political
movements
such
was
the
speaker
who
now
uttered
what
is
still
remembered
as
the
first
free
word
in
vienna
he
began
by
dwelling
on
the
importance
of
the
day
and
on
the
need
of
encouraging
the
men
who
sit
there
pointing
to
the
landhaus
by
our
appeal
to
them
of
strengthening
them
by
our
adherence
and
leading
them
to
the
desired
end
by
our
coöperation
in
action
he
exclaimed
fischhof
who
has
no
courage
on
such
a
day
as
this
is
only
fit
for
the
nursery
he
then
proceeded
to
dwell
at
some
length
on
the
need
for
freedom
of
the
press
and
trial
by
jury
then
catching
as
it
were
the
note
of
kossuth
speech
of
march
he
went
on
to
speak
of
the
greatness
which
austria
might
attain
by
combining
together
the
idealist
germans
the
steady
industrious
and
persevering
slavs
the
knightly
and
enthusiastic
magyars
the
clever
and
italians
finally
he
called
upon
them
to
demand
freedom
of
the
press
freedom
of
religion
freedom
of
teaching
and
learning
a
responsible
ministry
representation
of
the
people
arming
of
the
people
and
connection
with
germany
in
the
mean
time
the
estates
were
sitting
within
they
had
gathered
in
unusually
large
numbers
being
persuaded
by
their
president
that
they
were
bound
to
resist
the
stream
of
opinion
representatives
as
they
were
of
the
privileged
classes
they
had
little
sympathy
with
the
movement
that
was
going
on
in
vienna
nor
does
it
appear
that
there
was
anyone
among
them
who
was
disposed
to
play
the
part
of
a
confalonieri
or
szechenyi
much
less
of
a
mirabeau
or
a
lafayette
many
of
them
had
heard
rumors
of
the
coming
deputation
but
montecuccoli
their
president
refused
to
begin
the
proceedings
before
the
regular
hour
while
they
were
still
debating
this
point
they
heard
the
rush
of
the
crowd
outside
then
the
sudden
silence
and
then
fischhof
voice
several
members
were
seized
with
a
panic
and
desired
to
adjourn
again
montecuccoli
refused
to
yield
and
one
of
their
liberal
members
urged
them
to
take
courage
from
the
fact
of
this
deputation
to
make
stronger
demands
on
the
government
but
before
the
assembly
could
decide
to
act
the
crowd
outside
had
taken
sterner
measures
the
speakers
who
immediately
followed
fischhof
had
made
little
impression
then
another
doctor
named
goldmark
sprang
up
and
urged
the
people
to
break
into
the
landhaus
so
before
the
leaders
of
the
estates
had
decided
what
action
to
take
the
doors
were
suddenly
burst
open
and
fischhof
entered
at
the
head
of
the
crowd
he
announced
that
he
had
come
to
encourage
the
estates
in
their
deliberations
and
to
ask
them
to
sanction
the
demands
embodied
in
the
petition
of
the
people
montecuccoli
assured
the
deputation
that
the
emperor
had
already
promised
to
summon
the
provincial
assemblies
to
vienna
and
that
for
their
part
the
estates
of
lower
austria
were
in
favor
of
progress
but
he
added
they
must
have
room
and
opportunity
to
deliberate
fischhof
assented
to
this
suggestion
and
persuaded
his
followers
to
withdraw
to
the
courtyard
but
those
who
had
remained
behind
had
been
seized
with
a
fear
of
treachery
and
a
cry
arose
that
fischhof
had
been
arrested
thereupon
fischhof
showed
himself
with
montecuccoli
on
the
balcony
and
the
president
promised
that
the
estates
would
send
a
deputation
of
their
own
to
the
emperor
to
express
to
him
the
wishes
of
the
people
he
therefore
invited
the
crowd
to
choose
twelve
men
to
be
present
at
the
deliberations
of
the
estates
during
the
drawing
up
of
the
petition
while
the
election
of
these
twelve
was
still
going
on
a
hungarian
student
appeared
with
the
german
translation
of
speech
the
hungarian
voice
being
too
weak
to
make
itself
heard
he
handed
the
speech
to
a
tyrolese
student
who
read
it
to
the
crowd
the
allusion
to
the
need
of
a
constitution
was
received
with
loud
applause
and
so
also
was
the
expression
of
the
hopes
for
good
from
the
archduke
francis
joseph
but
however
much
the
reading
of
the
speech
had
encouraged
the
hopes
of
the
crowd
it
had
also
given
time
for
the
estates
to
decide
on
a
course
without
waiting
for
the
twelve
representatives
of
the
people
and
before
the
crowd
had
heard
the
end
of
kossuth
speech
the
reading
was
interrupted
by
a
message
from
the
estates
announcing
the
contents
of
their
proposed
petition
the
petition
had
shrunk
to
the
meagre
demand
that
a
report
on
the
condition
of
the
state
bank
should
be
laid
before
the
estates
and
that
a
committee
should
be
chosen
from
provincial
assemblies
to
consider
timely
reforms
and
to
take
a
share
in
legislation
the
feeble
character
of
the
proposed
compromise
roused
a
storm
of
scorn
and
rage
and
a
moravian
student
tore
the
message
of
the
estates
into
pieces
the
conclusion
of
kossuth
speech
roused
the
people
to
still
further
excitement
and
with
cries
for
a
free
constitution
for
union
with
germany
and
against
alliance
with
russia
the
crowd
once
more
broke
into
the
assembly
one
of
the
leading
students
then
demanded
of
montecuccoli
whether
this
was
the
whole
of
the
petition
they
intended
to
send
to
the
emperor
montecuccoli
answered
that
the
estates
had
been
so
disturbed
in
their
deliberations
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
come
to
a
final
decision
but
he
declared
that
they
desired
to
lay
before
the
emperor
all
the
wishes
of
the
people
again
the
leaders
of
the
crowd
repeated
in
slightly
altered
form
the
demands
originally
formulated
by
fischhof
at
last
after
considerable
discussion
montecuccoli
was
preparing
to
start
for
the
castle
at
the
head
of
the
estates
when
a
regiment
of
soldiers
arrived
but
they
were
unable
to
make
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
were
even
pressed
back
out
of
the
herren
gasse
the
desire
now
arose
for
better
protection
for
the
people
and
a
deputation
tried
to
persuade
the
burgomaster
of
vienna
to
call
out
the
city
guard
czapka
the
burgomaster
was
however
a
mere
tool
of
the
government
and
he
declared
that
the
archduke
albert
as
of
the
army
had
alone
the
power
of
calling
out
the
guard
the
archduke
albert
was
perhaps
next
to
louis
the
most
unpopular
of
the
royal
house
he
indignantly
refused
to
listen
to
any
demands
of
the
people
and
hastening
to
the
spot
rallied
the
soldiers
and
led
them
to
the
open
space
at
the
corner
of
the
herren
gasse
which
is
known
as
the
freyung
the
inner
circle
of
vienna
was
at
this
time
surrounded
with
walls
outside
of
which
were
the
large
suburbs
in
which
chiefly
workmen
lived
the
students
seem
already
to
have
gained
some
sympathy
with
the
workmen
and
for
the
previous
two
years
the
discontent
caused
by
the
sufferings
of
the
poorer
classes
had
been
taking
a
more
directly
political
turn
several
of
the
workmen
had
pressed
in
with
the
students
in
the
morning
into
the
inner
town
and
some
big
men
with
rough
darned
coats
and
dirty
caps
over
their
ears
were
seen
clenching
their
fists
for
the
fight
the
news
quickly
spread
to
the
suburbs
that
the
soldiers
were
about
to
attack
the
people
seizing
long
poles
and
any
iron
tools
which
came
to
hand
the
workmen
rushed
forward
to
the
gates
of
the
inner
town
in
one
district
they
found
the
town
gates
closed
against
them
and
cannon
placed
on
the
bastion
near
but
in
others
the
authorities
were
unprepared
and
the
workmen
burst
into
the
inner
town
tearing
down
stones
and
plaster
to
throw
at
the
soldiers
in
the
mean
time
the
representatives
of
the
estates
had
reached
the
castle
and
were
trying
to
persuade
the
authorities
to
yield
to
the
demands
of
the
people
metternich
persisted
in
believing
that
the
whole
affair
was
moved
by
foreign
influence
and
particularly
by
italians
and
swiss
and
he
desired
that
the
soldiers
should
gather
in
the
castle
and
that
prince
windischgraetz
should
be
appointed
commandant
of
the
city
alfred
windischgraetz
was
a
bohemian
nobleman
who
had
previously
been
known
chiefly
for
his
strong
aristocratic
feeling
which
he
was
said
to
have
embodied
in
the
expression
human
beings
begin
at
barons
but
he
had
been
marked
out
by
metternich
as
a
man
of
vigor
and
decision
who
might
be
trusted
to
act
in
an
emergency
latour
who
had
been
the
previous
commandant
of
the
castle
in
vienna
showed
signs
of
hesitation
at
this
crisis
and
this
gave
metternich
the
excuse
for
dismissing
latour
and
appointing
windischgraetz
in
his
place
to
this
arrangement
all
the
ruling
council
consented
but
when
archduke
louis
and
metternich
proposed
to
make
windischgraetz
military
dictator
of
the
city
and
to
allow
him
to
bring
out
cannon
for
firing
on
the
people
great
opposition
arose
the
archduke
john
was
perhaps
one
of
the
few
councillors
who
really
sympathized
with
liberal
ideas
but
several
of
the
archdukes
and
particularly
francis
charles
heartily
desired
the
fall
of
metternich
and
kolowrat
shared
their
wish
this
combined
opposition
of
sincere
reformers
and
jealous
courtiers
hindered
metternich
policy
and
it
was
decided
that
the
city
guard
should
first
be
called
out
and
that
the
dictatorship
of
windischgraetz
should
be
kept
in
reserve
as
a
last
resource
in
the
mean
time
the
struggle
on
the
streets
was
raging
fiercely
archduke
albert
had
found
to
his
cost
that
the
insurrection
was
not
as
he
had
supposed
the
work
of
a
few
discontented
men
the
students
fought
gallantly
but
a
still
fiercer
element
was
contributed
to
the
insurrection
by
the
workmen
who
had
come
in
from
the
suburbs
one
workman
was
wounded
in
his
head
his
arm
and
his
foot
but
he
continued
to
encourage
his
friends
and
cried
out
that
he
cared
nothing
for
life
either
he
would
die
that
day
or
else
the
high
gentlemen
should
be
overthrown
another
who
had
had
no
food
since
the
morning
entreated
for
a
little
refreshment
that
he
might
be
able
to
fight
the
better
and
he
quickly
returned
to
the
struggle
in
those
suburbs
from
which
the
workmen
had
not
been
able
to
break
into
the
inner
town
the
insurrection
threatened
to
assume
the
form
of
an
attack
on
the
employers
machines
were
destroyed
and
the
houses
of
those
employers
who
had
lowered
wages
were
set
on
fire
it
was
this
aspect
of
the
insurrection
which
encouraged
the
nobles
to
believe
that
by
calling
out
the
guard
they
would
induce
the
richer
citizens
to
take
arms
against
the
workmen
and
this
policy
was
carried
still
further
when
on
the
application
of
the
rector
of
the
university
the
students
also
were
allowed
the
privilege
of
bearing
arms
but
the
ruse
entirely
failed
the
people
recognized
the
city
guard
as
their
friends
and
refused
to
attack
them
and
the
rumor
soon
spread
that
the
police
had
fired
on
the
city
guard
it
was
now
evident
that
the
citizen
soldiers
were
on
the
side
of
the
people
and
the
richer
citizens
sent
a
deputation
to
entreat
that
metternich
should
be
dismissed
but
the
archduke
maximilian
was
resolved
that
as
the
first
expedient
proposed
by
the
council
had
failed
he
would
now
apply
some
of
those
more
violent
remedies
which
had
been
postponed
at
first
he
therefore
ordered
that
the
cannon
should
be
brought
down
from
the
castle
to
the
michaelerplatz
from
this
point
the
cannon
would
have
commanded
on
the
one
side
the
herren
gasse
where
the
crowd
had
gathered
in
the
morning
and
in
front
the
kohlmarkt
which
led
to
the
wide
street
of
amgraben
had
the
cannon
been
fired
then
and
there
the
course
of
the
insurrection
must
in
one
way
or
other
have
been
changed
that
change
might
have
been
as
maximilian
hoped
the
complete
collapse
of
the
insurrection
or
as
latour
held
the
cannon
might
have
swept
away
the
last
vestige
of
loyalty
to
the
emperor
and
the
republic
might
have
been
instantly
proclaimed
but
in
any
case
the
result
must
have
been
most
disastrous
to
the
cause
both
of
order
and
liberty
for
the
passions
which
had
already
been
roused
especially
among
the
workmen
could
hardly
have
failed
to
produce
one
of
those
savage
struggles
which
may
overthrow
one
tyranny
but
which
usually
end
in
the
establishment
of
another
fortunately
however
the
archduke
maximilian
seems
to
have
had
no
official
authority
in
this
matter
and
when
he
gave
the
order
to
fire
the
a
bohemian
named
pollett
declared
that
he
would
not
obey
the
order
unless
it
was
given
by
the
commander
of
the
forces
or
the
commander
of
the
town
the
archduke
then
appealed
to
the
subordinates
to
fire
in
spite
of
this
opposition
but
pollett
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
cannon
and
exclaimed
the
cannon
are
under
my
command
until
there
comes
an
order
from
my
commander
and
until
necessity
obliges
it
let
no
one
fire
on
friendly
unarmed
citizens
only
over
my
body
shall
you
fire
the
archduke
retired
in
despair
in
the
mean
time
the
deputation
of
citizens
had
reached
the
castle
at
first
the
officials
were
disposed
to
treat
them
angrily
and
even
tried
to
detain
them
by
force
but
the
news
of
the
concession
of
arms
to
the
students
the
urgent
pressure
of
archduke
john
and
the
accounts
of
the
growing
fury
of
the
people
finally
decided
metternich
to
yield
and
advancing
into
the
room
where
the
civic
deputation
was
assembled
he
declared
that
as
they
had
said
his
resignation
would
bring
peace
to
austria
he
now
resigned
his
office
and
wished
good
luck
to
the
new
government
many
of
the
royal
family
and
of
the
other
members
of
the
council
flattered
themselves
that
they
had
got
rid
of
a
formidable
enemy
without
making
any
definite
concession
to
the
people
windischgraetz
alone
protested
against
the
abandonment
of
metternich
by
the
rulers
of
austria
metternich
had
hoped
to
retire
quietly
to
his
own
villa
but
it
had
been
already
burned
in
the
insurrection
and
he
soon
found
that
it
was
safer
to
fly
from
vienna
and
eventually
to
take
refuge
in
england
he
had
however
one
consolation
in
all
his
misfortunes
in
the
memoir
written
four
years
later
he
expressed
his
certainty
that
he
at
least
had
done
no
wrong
and
that
if
he
had
to
begin
his
career
again
he
would
follow
the
same
course
he
took
before
and
would
not
deviate
from
it
for
an
instant
when
at
eight
in
the
evening
of
march
men
went
through
the
streets
of
vienna
crying
out
metternich
is
fallen
it
seemed
as
if
the
march
of
the
students
and
the
petition
of
fischhof
had
produced
in
one
day
all
the
results
desired
but
neither
the
suspicions
of
the
people
nor
the
violent
intentions
of
the
princes
were
at
an
end
the
archdukes
still
talked
of
making
windischgraetz
dictator
of
vienna
the
workmen
still
raged
in
the
suburbs
and
the
students
refused
to
leave
the
university
for
fear
an
attack
should
be
made
upon
it
but
in
spite
of
the
violence
of
the
workmen
the
leaders
of
the
richer
citizens
were
more
and
more
determined
to
make
common
cause
with
reformers
indeed
both
they
and
the
students
hoped
to
check
the
violence
of
the
riots
while
they
prevented
any
reactionary
movement
the
emperor
also
was
on
the
side
of
concession
he
refused
to
let
the
people
be
fired
on
and
announced
on
the
the
freedom
of
the
press
but
unfortunately
he
was
seized
with
one
of
his
epileptic
fits
and
the
intriguers
who
were
already
consolidating
themselves
into
the
secret
council
known
as
the
camarilla
published
the
news
of
windischgraetz
dictatorship
and
resolved
to
place
vienna
under
a
state
of
siege
while
the
emperor
was
incapable
of
giving
directions
the
news
of
windischgraetz
accession
to
power
so
alarmed
the
people
that
they
at
once
decided
to
march
upon
the
castle
but
one
of
the
leading
citizens
named
arthaber
persuaded
them
to
abandon
their
intention
and
instead
to
send
him
and
another
friend
to
ask
for
a
constitution
from
the
emperor
a
struggle
was
evidently
going
on
between
ferdinand
and
his
courtiers
whenever
he
was
strong
and
able
to
hold
his
own
he
was
ready
to
make
concessions
whenever
he
was
either
ill
or
still
suffering
from
the
mental
effects
of
his
illness
the
government
fell
into
the
hands
of
windischgraetz
and
the
archdukes
and
violent
measures
were
proposed
thus
though
arthaber
and
his
friends
were
received
courteously
and
assured
of
the
constitutional
intentions
of
the
emperor
at
eleven
on
the
same
night
there
appeared
a
public
notice
declaring
vienna
in
a
state
of
siege
but
even
windischgraetz
seems
to
have
been
somewhat
frightened
by
the
undaunted
attitude
of
the
people
and
when
he
found
that
his
notice
was
torn
down
from
the
walls
and
that
a
new
insurrection
was
about
to
break
out
he
sent
for
professor
hye
and
entreated
him
to
preserve
order
in
the
mean
time
the
emperor
had
to
some
extent
recovered
his
senses
and
he
speedily
issued
a
promise
to
summon
the
estates
of
the
german
and
slavonic
provinces
and
the
congregations
of
but
the
people
had
had
enough
of
sham
constitutions
and
the
proclamation
was
torn
down
this
act
however
did
not
imply
any
personal
hostility
to
ferdinand
for
the
belief
that
the
austrian
ministers
were
thwarting
the
good
intentions
of
their
master
was
as
deeply
rooted
at
this
time
in
the
minds
of
the
viennese
as
was
a
similar
belief
with
regard
to
pius
ix
and
his
cardinals
in
the
minds
of
the
romans
and
when
the
emperor
drove
out
on
march
he
was
received
with
loud
cheers
but
as
ferdinand
listened
to
these
cheers
he
must
have
noticed
that
louder
than
the
lebe
der
of
his
german
subjects
and
the
of
the
bohemians
rose
the
sound
of
the
hungarian
for
mingling
in
the
crowd
with
the
ordinary
inhabitants
of
vienna
was
the
hungarian
deputation
which
had
at
last
been
permitted
by
the
count
palatine
to
leave
presburg
and
which
had
arrived
in
vienna
to
demand
both
freedoms
that
had
been
granted
to
the
germans
and
also
a
separate
responsible
ministry
for
hungary
they
arrived
in
the
full
glory
of
recent
successes
in
the
presburg
diet
for
strengthened
by
the
news
of
the
viennese
rising
kossuth
had
carried
in
one
day
many
of
the
reforms
for
which
his
party
had
so
long
been
contending
the
last
remnants
of
the
dependent
condition
of
the
peasantry
had
been
swept
away
taxation
had
been
made
universal
and
freedom
of
the
press
and
universal
military
service
had
been
promised
szechenyi
alone
had
ventured
to
raise
a
note
of
warning
and
it
had
fallen
unheeded
in
vienna
kossuth
was
welcomed
almost
as
cordially
as
in
presburg
for
the
german
movement
in
vienna
had
tended
to
produce
in
its
supporters
a
willingness
to
lose
the
eastern
half
of
the
empire
in
order
to
obtain
the
union
of
the
western
half
with
germany
so
the
notes
of
were
mingled
with
the
cry
of
lajos
minister
praesident
before
such
a
combination
as
this
ferdinand
had
no
desire
windischgraetz
no
power
to
maintain
an
obstinate
resistance
and
on
march
sedlnitzky
the
hated
head
of
the
police
was
dismissed
from
office
on
the
a
responsible
ministry
was
appointed
and
on
the
windischgraetz
announced
that
national
affairs
would
now
be
guided
on
the
path
of
progress
in
the
mean
time
that
german
movement
from
which
the
viennese
derived
so
much
of
their
impulse
had
been
gaining
a
new
accession
of
force
in
the
north
of
germany
in
berlin
the
order
of
the
viennese
movements
had
been
to
some
extent
reversed
there
the
artisans
instead
of
taking
their
tone
from
the
students
had
given
the
first
impulse
to
reform
the
king
indeed
had
begun
his
concessions
by
granting
freedom
of
the
press
on
march
but
it
seemed
very
unlikely
that
this
concession
would
be
accompanied
by
any
securities
that
would
make
it
a
reality
the
king
even
refused
to
fulfil
his
promise
of
summoning
the
assembly
and
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
refusal
that
the
artisans
presented
to
the
town
council
of
berlin
a
petition
for
the
redress
of
their
special
grievances
the
same
kind
of
misery
which
prevailed
in
vienna
had
shown
itself
though
in
less
degree
in
berlin
and
committees
had
been
formed
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
the
town
council
refused
to
present
the
petition
of
the
workmen
and
in
order
to
take
the
movement
out
of
their
hands
presented
a
petition
of
their
own
in
favor
of
freedom
of
the
press
trial
by
jury
representation
of
the
german
people
in
the
bundestag
and
the
summoning
of
all
the
provincial
assemblies
of
the
kingdom
this
petition
was
rejected
by
the
king
and
thereupon
on
march
the
people
gathered
in
large
numbers
in
the
streets
general
pfuel
fired
on
them
but
instead
of
yielding
they
threw
up
barricades
and
a
fierce
struggle
ensued
on
the
the
cry
for
complete
freedom
of
the
press
became
louder
and
more
prominent
and
the
insurgents
were
encouraged
by
the
first
news
of
the
vienna
rising
the
other
parts
of
the
kingdom
now
joined
in
the
movement
on
the
came
deputations
from
the
rhine
province
who
demanded
in
a
threatening
manner
the
extension
of
popular
liberties
on
the
came
the
more
important
news
that
posen
and
silesia
were
in
revolt
mieroslawsky
who
had
been
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
polish
movement
of
had
gained
much
popularity
in
berlin
and
he
seemed
fully
disposed
to
combine
the
movement
for
the
independence
of
posen
with
that
for
the
freedom
of
prussia
much
in
the
same
way
as
kossuth
had
combined
the
cause
of
hungarian
liberty
with
the
demand
for
an
austrian
constitution
in
silesia
no
doubt
the
terrible
famine
of
the
previous
year
and
the
remains
of
feudal
oppression
had
sharpened
the
desire
for
liberty
and
closely
following
on
the
news
of
these
two
revolts
came
clearer
accounts
of
the
viennese
rising
and
the
happy
tidings
of
the
fall
of
metternich
the
king
of
prussia
promised
on
the
arrival
of
this
news
to
summon
the
assembly
for
april
and
two
days
later
he
appeared
on
the
balcony
of
his
palace
and
declared
his
desire
to
change
germany
from
an
alliance
of
states
into
a
federal
state
but
the
suspicions
of
the
people
had
now
been
thoroughly
aroused
and
on
march
the
very
day
on
which
the
king
made
this
declaration
fresh
deputations
came
to
demand
liberties
from
him
and
when
he
appealed
to
them
to
go
home
his
request
was
not
complied
with
the
threatening
attitude
of
the
soldiers
and
the
recollection
of
their
violence
on
the
preceding
days
had
convinced
the
people
that
until
part
at
least
of
the
military
force
was
removed
they
could
have
no
security
for
liberty
the
events
of
the
day
justified
their
belief
for
while
some
one
was
reading
aloud
to
the
people
the
account
of
the
concessions
recently
made
by
the
king
the
soldiers
suddenly
fired
upon
them
and
the
crowd
fled
in
every
direction
they
fled
however
soon
to
rally
again
barricades
were
once
more
thrown
up
the
poles
of
posen
flocked
in
to
help
their
friends
and
the
black
red
and
gold
flag
of
germany
was
displayed
women
joined
the
fight
at
the
barricades
and
on
the
some
of
the
riflemen
whom
the
king
had
brought
from
neuchâtel
refused
to
fire
upon
the
people
then
the
king
suddenly
yielded
dismissed
his
ministers
and
promised
to
withdraw
the
troops
and
allow
the
arming
of
the
people
the
victory
of
the
popular
cause
seemed
now
complete
but
the
bitterness
which
still
remained
in
the
hearts
of
the
citizens
was
shown
by
a
public
funeral
procession
through
berlin
in
honor
of
those
who
had
fallen
in
the
struggle
the
king
stood
on
the
balcony
as
the
procession
passed
the
palace
and
on
march
he
came
forward
in
public
waving
the
black
red
and
gold
flag
of
germany
the
revolt
of
hungary
arminius
vambery
deep
interest
throughout
the
civilized
world
was
aroused
by
the
unavailing
struggle
of
hungary
in
for
national
independence
the
name
of
louis
kossuth
the
hungarian
patriot
and
famous
orator
became
celebrated
in
many
lands
and
in
the
various
countries
where
he
sojourned
as
an
exile
from
his
own
especially
in
the
united
states
and
in
england
his
eloquent
appeals
awakened
profound
sympathy
for
his
people
cause
vambery
however
regards
compatriot
count
stephen
szechenyi
born
in
as
the
greatest
hungarian
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
was
descended
from
a
distinguished
family
which
had
given
to
its
country
many
champions
of
liberty
the
great
aim
of
his
life
was
to
revive
the
drooping
energies
of
the
nation
as
a
youth
he
served
in
the
army
entering
the
famous
diet
of
in
which
by
right
of
birth
he
took
his
seat
in
the
upper
house
he
distinguished
himself
by
his
liberal
leadership
and
as
a
writer
and
an
advocate
of
public
endowments
accomplished
much
for
the
education
of
his
people
up
to
the
time
at
which
vambery
the
celebrated
historian
of
hungary
begins
the
present
narrative
the
growth
of
the
national
spirit
had
been
more
and
more
evident
each
year
since
the
end
of
the
napoleonic
wars
for
more
than
two
centuries
hungary
had
been
under
the
oppressive
rule
of
austria
hungary
had
furnished
soldiers
to
austria
in
her
struggle
against
bonaparte
and
the
austrian
emperor
had
repeatedly
promised
to
redress
hungarian
grievances
but
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
these
promises
were
repudiated
hungary
so
emphatically
showed
her
indignation
that
the
emperor
was
compelled
to
convoke
the
diet
in
which
szechenyi
distinguished
himself
the
subsequent
career
of
this
leader
the
character
and
aims
of
kossuth
and
the
insurrection
they
did
so
much
to
incite
are
powerfully
described
by
vambery
who
writes
not
only
as
an
author
fully
versed
in
his
country
annals
but
also
as
a
patriot
jealous
of
her
liberties
proud
of
her
heroic
sons
and
loyal
to
her
fame
for
fifteen
years
up
to
the
popularity
of
szechenyi
extended
over
hungary
and
his
name
was
cherished
by
every
patriot
in
the
land
about
this
time
however
the
great
statesman
was
destined
to
come
into
collision
with
a
man
who
was
his
peer
in
genius
and
abilities
the
two
patriots
were
representatives
of
different
methods
and
in
the
contest
produced
by
the
shock
of
antagonistic
tendencies
szechenyi
was
compelled
to
yield
to
louis
kossuth
his
younger
rival
although
there
was
no
material
difference
between
their
aims
for
both
wished
to
see
their
country
great
free
constitutionally
governed
prosperous
and
advanced
in
civilization
yet
in
the
ways
and
means
employed
by
them
to
attain
that
aim
they
were
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other
szechenyi
who
descended
from
a
family
of
ancient
and
aristocratic
lineage
and
presented
himself
to
the
nation
with
connections
reaching
up
into
the
highest
circles
of
the
court
with
the
lustre
of
his
ancient
name
and
with
his
immense
fortune
wished
to
secure
the
happiness
of
his
country
by
quite
different
methods
from
those
adopted
by
louis
kossuth
a
child
of
the
people
who
although
he
was
a
nobleman
by
birth
yet
belonged
to
that
poorer
class
of
gentry
who
support
themselves
by
their
own
exertions
and
who
in
hungary
are
destined
to
fulfil
the
mission
of
the
of
other
countries
it
is
from
this
class
of
the
gentry
for
the
most
part
that
are
recruited
the
the
smaller
landowners
professional
men
writers
subordinate
officials
lawyers
physicians
clergymen
teachers
and
professors
by
virtue
of
their
nobility
it
is
true
they
belonged
to
the
privileged
class
of
the
country
and
were
not
subjected
to
the
humiliations
of
the
oppressed
peasantry
yet
they
had
to
earn
a
living
by
their
own
work
and
were
therefore
not
only
accessible
to
but
were
ready
enthusiastically
to
receive
the
lofty
message
of
liberty
and
equality
which
the
french
revolution
of
began
to
proclaim
anew
throughout
europe
these
doctrines
formed
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
views
of
count
stephen
szechenyi
views
which
owing
to
the
social
position
of
the
man
who
held
them
were
not
devoid
of
a
certain
aristocratic
tinge
and
according
to
which
the
most
important
part
in
the
regeneration
of
the
hungarian
nation
was
assigned
to
the
aristocracy
it
was
a
part
however
which
the
hungarian
aristocracy
was
itself
by
no
means
disposed
to
assume
among
its
younger
members
indeed
could
be
found
here
and
there
enthusiastic
men
who
were
devotedly
attached
to
the
person
of
the
lordly
reformer
but
the
great
majority
of
his
class
were
hostilely
arrayed
against
szechenyi
aims
and
obstructing
the
granting
of
even
the
most
inoffensive
demands
of
the
nation
supported
the
viennese
government
which
was
rigidly
opposed
to
political
reforms
and
to
any
changes
in
the
public
institutions
of
the
country
this
attitude
of
the
aristocracy
compelled
szechenyi
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
all
questions
concerning
constitutionality
and
liberty
and
to
confine
the
work
of
reform
chiefly
to
the
sphere
of
internal
improvements
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
hope
to
obtain
the
support
of
the
court
of
vienna
and
of
the
majority
of
the
upper
house
for
his
measures
was
to
remain
as
neutral
as
possible
in
politics
the
idea
which
chiefly
governed
his
actions
was
that
the
country
should
be
first
strengthened
internally
and
that
afterward
it
would
be
easy
for
the
nation
to
bring
about
the
triumph
of
her
national
and
political
aspirations
after
however
the
bulk
of
the
nation
and
especially
the
small
gentry
whose
preponderating
influence
was
making
itself
continually
felt
were
unwilling
to
follow
szechenyi
in
his
policy
the
reformatory
work
of
szechenyi
during
the
preceding
fifteen
years
had
educated
public
opinion
up
to
new
and
great
ideas
but
the
leaders
of
that
public
opinion
were
now
to
be
found
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
persons
of
francis
deak
and
louis
kossuth
they
wished
to
obtain
for
their
country
both
political
liberty
and
material
prosperity
they
knew
the
effect
of
political
institutions
upon
the
material
and
civilization
of
a
nation
and
they
no
longer
deemed
it
possible
to
attain
these
objects
without
a
modern
constitutional
government
louis
kossuth
who
was
born
in
was
the
very
incarnation
of
the
great
democratic
ideas
of
his
age
he
was
entirely
a
man
of
work
and
entered
the
legal
profession
after
he
had
completed
his
studies
with
great
distinction
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
himself
by
it
kossuth
was
present
at
the
diet
of
when
the
government
which
conducted
itself
most
brutally
and
arbitrarily
toward
the
press
refused
to
allow
the
newspapers
to
print
reports
of
the
deliberations
of
the
diet
in
spite
of
the
repeated
urgings
by
the
deputies
for
such
an
authorization
and
it
was
owing
to
his
ingenuity
that
this
prohibition
was
evaded
the
censorship
was
exercised
on
printed
matter
only
and
did
not
extend
to
manuscripts
kossuth
wrote
out
the
reports
of
the
diet
himself
had
numerous
copies
made
of
them
in
writing
and
circulated
them
for
a
slight
fee
in
every
part
of
the
country
where
they
were
looked
for
with
feverish
expectation
and
owing
to
the
spirit
of
opposition
with
which
they
were
colored
were
read
with
the
greatest
eagerness
this
manuscript
newspaper
produced
quite
a
revolutionary
movement
among
the
people
frightening
even
the
austrian
government
the
latter
now
attempted
to
silence
kossuth
by
gentle
means
promising
him
high
offices
and
a
pension
but
he
refused
the
enticing
offers
and
continued
his
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
nation
foiled
in
the
attempt
to
lure
kossuth
from
his
duty
the
government
resorted
to
violence
seized
the
lithographic
apparatus
by
means
of
which
kossuth
planned
to
multiply
his
manuscript
newspaper
and
gave
directions
to
the
postmasters
to
detain
and
open
all
those
sealed
packages
which
were
supposed
to
contain
the
reports
but
these
arbitrary
proceedings
of
the
government
could
not
put
an
end
to
the
circulation
of
the
newspaper
the
country
gentlemen
by
their
own
servants
continued
to
send
each
other
single
copies
and
the
matter
was
given
up
only
when
the
diet
ceased
to
be
in
session
then
kossuth
at
the
urgent
request
of
his
friends
and
one
might
say
of
the
whole
country
started
a
new
manuscript
newspaper
at
budapest
which
reported
the
deliberations
of
the
county
assemblies
the
effect
produced
by
this
new
paper
was
fraught
with
even
greater
consequences
than
the
first
had
created
for
it
was
instrumental
in
bringing
the
counties
into
contact
with
one
another
thus
giving
them
an
opportunity
to
combine
against
the
government
the
latter
however
soon
prohibited
its
publication
but
the
prohibition
gave
rise
to
a
storm
of
indignation
throughout
the
whole
country
the
counties
in
solid
array
addressed
protests
to
the
government
against
the
illegal
act
and
in
behalf
of
kossuth
who
continued
to
publish
the
paper
in
spite
of
the
inhibition
the
government
at
last
resorted
to
the
most
barefaced
brutality
kossuth
the
brave
champion
of
liberty
its
eloquent
pen
and
herald
was
dragged
to
a
damp
and
dark
subterranean
in
the
castle
of
buda
and
detained
there
while
his
father
and
mother
and
his
family
who
were
looking
to
him
solely
for
their
support
were
robbed
of
the
aid
of
their
natural
protector
although
at
that
period
lawlessness
was
the
order
of
the
day
yet
this
last
cruel
and
illegal
act
of
the
government
greatly
exasperated
the
public
mind
which
was
already
in
a
ferment
of
excitement
but
while
the
excited
passions
raged
throughout
the
country
the
government
nothing
loth
caused
kossuth
to
be
prosecuted
for
high
treason
and
having
obtained
his
conviction
had
him
sentenced
to
an
imprisonment
of
three
years
kossuth
applied
himself
during
his
detention
to
serious
studies
and
acquired
also
while
in
prison
the
english
language
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
enabled
to
address
in
that
language
during
his
exile
with
great
effect
and
impressiveness
large
audiences
both
in
england
and
in
the
united
states
of
america
his
imprisonment
lasted
two
long
years
after
the
lapse
of
which
he
obtained
in
a
pardon
in
consequence
of
the
repeated
and
urgent
representations
of
the
diet
kossuth
returned
to
the
scene
of
his
former
activity
as
the
martyr
of
free
speech
and
the
victim
to
the
cause
of
the
nation
he
very
soon
found
a
new
field
in
which
to
labor
the
government
perceived
at
last
that
violence
was
of
little
avail
and
that
those
questions
which
were
occupying
the
minds
to
such
a
degree
could
no
longer
be
kept
from
being
publicly
discussed
by
the
press
kossuth
now
obtained
permission
to
edit
a
political
daily
paper
its
publication
was
commenced
under
the
title
of
newspaper
of
pest
in
and
may
be
said
to
have
created
the
political
daily
press
of
hungary
it
disseminated
new
ideas
among
the
masses
stirred
up
the
indifferent
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
country
and
gave
a
purpose
to
the
national
aspirations
it
proclaimed
democratic
reforms
in
every
department
the
abolition
of
the
privileges
of
the
nobility
and
of
their
exemption
from
taxation
equal
rights
and
equal
burdens
for
all
the
citizens
of
the
state
and
the
extension
of
public
instruction
and
it
endeavored
to
restore
the
hungarian
nationality
to
the
place
it
was
entitled
to
claim
in
the
organism
of
the
state
the
wealth
of
ideas
thus
daily
communicated
to
the
country
appeared
in
the
most
attractive
garb
for
kossuth
possessed
a
masterly
style
and
his
leaders
and
shorter
articles
showed
off
to
advantage
so
many
unexpected
beauties
of
the
hungarian
language
that
his
readers
were
fairly
enchanted
and
carried
away
by
them
his
articles
were
a
happy
compound
of
poetical
elevation
and
oratorical
power
gratifying
and
the
imagination
at
the
same
time
appealing
by
their
lucid
exposition
to
the
reader
intelligence
and
exciting
and
warming
his
fancy
by
their
fervor
kossuth
always
rightly
guessed
what
questions
most
interested
the
nation
and
the
daily
press
became
in
his
hands
a
power
in
hungary
electrifying
the
masses
who
were
always
ready
to
give
their
unconditional
support
to
his
bold
and
schemes
the
extraordinary
influence
obtained
by
kossuth
through
his
paper
frightened
szechenyi
and
to
even
a
greater
degree
those
whose
prejudices
were
shocked
or
ancient
privileges
and
interests
were
endangered
by
the
democratic
agitations
for
reform
kossuth
was
attacked
in
books
pamphlets
and
newspapers
but
he
came
out
victorious
from
all
contests
in
vain
did
szechenyi
himself
backed
by
his
great
authority
in
the
land
assail
him
declaring
that
he
did
not
object
to
ideas
but
that
his
manner
and
his
tactics
were
reprehensible
and
that
the
latter
were
sure
to
lead
to
a
revolution
the
great
mass
of
the
people
felt
instinctively
that
revolution
had
become
a
necessity
and
was
unavoidable
if
hungary
was
to
pass
from
the
old
mediaeval
order
to
the
establishment
of
modern
institutions
and
was
to
become
a
state
where
equality
before
the
law
should
be
the
ruling
standard
the
masses
were
strengthened
in
this
conviction
by
the
unreasonable
and
violent
policy
pursued
by
the
government
of
vienna
which
obstructed
the
slightest
reforms
in
the
ancient
institutions
and
opposed
every
national
aspiration
and
under
whose
protecting
wing
the
reactionary
elements
of
the
upper
house
were
constantly
paralyzing
the
noblest
and
best
efforts
made
by
the
lower
house
for
the
public
weal
while
the
same
government
arbitrarily
supported
claims
of
the
catholic
clergy
in
flat
contradiction
to
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
various
denominations
inhabiting
the
country
the
government
in
its
antipathy
to
the
national
movement
went
even
further
it
secretly
incited
the
other
nationalities
especially
the
croats
against
the
hungarians
and
thus
planted
the
seeds
from
which
sprang
the
subsequent
great
civil
war
in
observing
the
dangerous
symptoms
preceding
the
movement
and
the
bloody
scenes
and
fights
provoked
at
every
election
by
the
hirelings
of
the
government
in
order
to
intimidate
the
adherents
of
reform
the
friends
of
progress
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
the
period
of
moderation
such
as
preached
by
szechenyi
had
passed
by
and
must
give
way
to
that
resolute
policy
advocated
by
kossuth
which
recoiled
from
no
consequences
numerous
magnates
all
the
chief
leaders
of
the
gentry
boasting
of
enlightenment
and
patriotism
and
imbued
with
european
culture
rallied
around
kossuth
until
finally
the
public
opinion
of
the
country
and
the
enthusiasm
of
which
he
was
the
centre
caused
him
to
be
returned
in
together
with
count
louis
batthyanyi
as
deputy
from
the
foremost
county
of
the
country
the
county
of
pest
during
the
first
months
of
the
diet
of
which
was
to
raise
hungary
to
the
rank
of
those
countries
that
proclaimed
equal
rights
and
possessed
a
responsible
parliamentary
government
it
differed
very
little
from
the
one
preceding
it
the
opposition
initiated
great
reforms
as
before
but
there
was
no
one
who
believed
that
their
realization
was
near
at
hand
kossuth
repeatedly
addressed
the
house
and
soon
convinced
his
audience
that
he
was
as
irresistible
an
orator
as
he
had
proved
powerful
as
a
writer
but
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
country
was
on
the
eve
of
a
great
transformation
the
revolution
of
february
which
broke
out
in
paris
changed
as
if
by
magic
the
relative
positions
of
austria
and
hungary
system
of
government
which
was
opposed
to
granting
liberty
to
the
people
collapsed
at
once
the
storm
of
popular
indignation
swept
it
away
like
a
house
built
of
cards
at
the
first
news
of
the
occurrences
in
paris
kossuth
asked
in
the
lower
house
for
the
creation
of
a
responsible
ministry
the
motion
was
favorably
received
but
in
the
upper
house
it
was
rejected
the
government
not
being
yet
alive
to
the
real
state
of
affairs
and
still
hoping
by
a
system
of
negation
to
frustrate
the
wishes
of
the
people
but
very
soon
the
revolution
reared
its
head
in
vienna
itself
and
the
wishes
of
the
hungarian
people
uttered
at
budapest
received
thereby
a
new
and
powerful
advocate
at
that
time
the
hungarian
diet
still
met
at
presburg
but
the
two
of
buda
and
pest
formed
the
real
capital
of
the
country
and
were
the
centre
of
commerce
industry
science
and
literature
michael
vorosmarty
the
poet
laureate
of
the
nation
lived
in
pest
and
there
the
twin
stars
of
literature
alexander
petofi
and
maurice
jokai
shone
on
the
national
horizon
jokai
who
is
still
living
and
enjoys
a
fame
as
a
novelist
and
petofi
the
eminent
poet
who
was
destined
to
become
the
tyrtaeus
of
his
nation
were
then
both
young
men
full
of
enthusiasm
and
intrepid
energy
and
teeming
with
great
ideas
about
these
two
gathered
the
other
writers
and
youth
of
the
university
and
all
of
them
helping
one
another
contrived
on
hearing
the
news
of
the
sudden
revolutions
in
paris
and
vienna
to
enact
in
budapest
the
bloodless
revolution
of
march
which
obtained
the
liberty
of
the
press
for
the
nation
and
at
the
same
time
in
a
solemn
manifesto
gave
expression
to
the
wishes
of
the
hungarians
in
the
matter
of
reform
the
only
act
of
violence
these
revolutionary
heroes
were
guilty
of
was
the
entering
of
a
printing
establishment
whose
proprietor
afraid
of
the
government
had
refused
to
print
the
admirable
poem
of
petofi
entitled
up
magyar
and
doing
the
printing
there
themselves
the
first
stanza
of
this
poem
later
the
of
the
national
movement
runs
in
a
literal
translation
thus
arise
o
magyar
thy
country
calls
here
is
the
time
now
or
never
shall
we
be
slaves
or
free
that
is
the
question
choose
we
swear
by
the
god
of
the
magyars
we
swear
to
be
slaves
no
longer
this
poem
was
improvised
by
petofi
under
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
and
at
the
same
establishment
where
it
was
first
printed
was
also
printed
a
proclamation
which
contained
twelve
articles
setting
forth
the
wishes
of
the
people
while
the
capital
was
resounding
with
the
rejoicings
and
triumphant
shouts
of
her
exulting
inhabitants
the
proper
department
of
the
government
for
the
carrying
through
of
these
movements
the
diet
assembled
at
presburg
lost
no
time
and
set
to
work
with
great
energy
to
reform
the
institutions
of
hungary
constitutionally
and
to
put
into
the
form
of
law
the
ideas
of
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
the
salutary
legislation
met
now
with
no
opposition
either
from
the
upper
house
or
from
the
court
at
vienna
and
in
a
short
time
the
diet
passed
the
celebrated
acts
of
which
having
received
the
royal
sanction
were
proclaimed
as
laws
on
april
at
presburg
amid
the
wildest
enthusiasm
in
the
presence
of
king
ferdinand
by
these
laws
hungary
became
a
modern
state
possessing
a
constitutional
government
the
government
was
vested
in
a
ministry
responsible
to
the
parliament
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
were
declared
equal
before
the
law
the
privileges
of
the
nobility
were
abolished
the
soil
was
declared
free
and
the
right
of
free
worship
accorded
to
all
the
institution
of
national
guards
was
introduced
the
utmost
liberty
of
the
press
was
secured
transylvania
became
a
part
of
the
in
a
word
the
national
and
political
condition
of
the
country
was
reorganized
in
every
particular
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
the
demands
and
aspirations
of
our
age
at
the
same
time
the
men
placed
at
the
head
of
the
government
were
such
as
possessed
the
fullest
confidence
of
the
people
the
first
ministry
was
composed
of
the
most
distinguished
patriots
count
louis
batthyanyi
was
the
president
and
acting
in
conjunction
with
him
were
francis
deak
as
minister
of
justice
count
stephen
szechenyi
as
minister
of
home
affairs
and
louis
kossuth
as
minister
of
finance
the
great
mass
of
the
people
hailed
with
boundless
enthusiasm
the
new
government
and
the
magnificent
reforms
the
transformation
however
had
been
so
sudden
and
unexpected
and
the
old
aristocratic
world
with
all
its
institutions
and
its
ancient
organization
had
been
swept
away
with
such
vehement
precipitation
that
even
under
ordinary
circumstances
in
the
absence
of
all
opposition
the
new
ideas
and
tendencies
could
have
hardly
entered
into
the
political
life
of
the
nation
without
causing
some
confusion
and
disorder
but
in
addition
to
these
natural
drawbacks
the
new
order
of
things
had
to
contend
with
certain
national
elements
in
the
population
which
feeling
themselves
injured
in
their
real
or
imaginary
interests
were
bent
on
mischief
hoping
to
be
able
to
rob
the
nation
in
the
midst
of
the
ensuing
troubles
of
the
great
political
prize
she
had
won
certain
circles
of
the
court
and
classes
of
the
people
strove
equally
hard
to
surround
with
difficulties
the
practical
introduction
of
the
constitution
of
the
court
and
the
standing
army
the
party
of
the
soldier
class
feared
that
their
commanding
position
would
be
impaired
by
the
predominating
influence
of
the
people
the
portion
of
the
inhabitants
choosing
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
new
laws
secured
without
distinction
of
nationality
equal
rights
to
every
citizen
of
the
state
were
apprehensive
lest
the
liberal
constitution
would
benefit
chiefly
the
hungarian
element
of
the
nation
they
therefore
encouraged
by
the
secret
machinations
of
the
government
of
vienna
took
up
arms
in
order
to
drag
the
country
which
was
preparing
to
take
possession
of
her
new
liberties
into
a
civil
war
the
croatians
under
the
lead
of
ban
jellachich
and
the
wallachs
and
serbs
led
by
other
imperial
officers
and
yielding
to
their
persuasions
rose
in
rebellion
against
hungary
and
began
to
persecute
plunder
and
murder
the
hungarians
living
among
them
dreadful
atrocities
were
committed
in
the
southern
and
eastern
portions
of
hungary
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
families
were
massacred
in
cold
blood
and
entire
villages
and
cities
were
deserted
by
their
inhabitants
just
as
had
previously
happened
at
the
approach
of
the
turks
and
thousands
were
compelled
to
abandon
their
all
to
the
rebels
in
order
to
escape
with
their
bare
lives
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
the
flames
of
rebellion
had
spread
over
a
large
part
of
the
country
and
the
hungarian
element
instead
of
enjoying
the
liberties
won
for
the
whole
nation
after
a
bitter
struggle
of
many
decades
was
under
the
sad
necessity
of
resorting
to
armed
force
in
order
to
reëstablish
the
internal
peace
the
hungarians
now
had
to
prove
on
the
battlefield
and
in
bloody
engagements
that
they
were
worthy
of
liberty
and
capable
of
defending
it
the
government
which
by
virtue
of
the
new
laws
had
meanwhile
transferred
its
seat
to
budapest
displayed
extraordinary
energy
in
the
face
of
the
sad
difficulties
besetting
it
as
it
was
impossible
to
rely
upon
the
austrian
soldiers
who
were
still
in
the
country
it
exerted
itself
to
create
and
to
organize
a
national
army
a
portion
of
the
national
guard
entered
the
national
army
under
the
name
of
defenders
of
the
country
a
name
which
became
before
long
famous
throughout
the
civilized
world
for
the
brilliant
military
achievements
connected
with
it
the
hungarian
soldiers
garrisoning
the
austrian
principalities
hastened
home
braving
the
greatest
dangers
partly
accompanied
by
their
officers
and
partly
without
them
the
famous
hungarian
hussars
especially
returned
in
great
number
to
offer
their
services
to
their
imperilled
country
but
all
this
proved
insufficient
and
as
soon
as
the
national
assembly
elected
under
the
new
constitution
met
kossuth
who
had
been
the
life
and
soul
of
the
government
during
this
trying
and
critical
period
called
upon
the
nation
to
raise
large
armies
for
the
defence
of
the
country
the
session
of
july
during
which
kossuth
introduced
in
the
house
of
representatives
his
motions
relating
to
the
subject
presented
a
scene
which
beggars
all
description
kossuth
ascended
the
tribune
pale
and
haggard
with
illness
but
the
applause
that
greeted
him
after
the
first
few
sentences
soon
gave
him
back
his
strength
and
his
marvellous
oratorical
power
when
he
had
concluded
his
speech
and
submitted
to
the
house
his
request
for
two
hundred
thousand
soldiers
and
the
necessary
money
a
momentary
pause
of
deep
silence
ensued
suddenly
paul
nyary
the
leader
of
the
opposition
arose
and
lifting
his
right
arm
toward
heaven
exclaimed
we
grant
it
the
house
was
in
a
fever
of
patriotic
excitement
all
the
deputies
rose
from
their
seats
shouting
we
grant
it
we
grant
it
kossuth
with
tears
in
his
eyes
bowed
to
the
representatives
of
the
people
and
said
you
have
risen
like
one
man
and
i
bow
down
before
the
greatness
of
the
nation
these
sacrifices
on
the
part
of
the
country
had
become
a
matter
of
urgent
necessity
the
serb
and
wallach
insurrection
assumed
every
day
larger
proportions
while
the
croats
under
the
leadership
of
jellachich
entered
hungarian
territory
with
the
fixed
determination
of
depriving
the
nation
of
her
constitutional
liberties
but
the
hungarian
government
was
already
able
to
send
an
army
against
the
croatians
who
were
marching
on
budapest
plundering
and
laying
waste
everything
before
them
they
were
surrounded
by
the
hungarian
forces
and
a
part
of
their
army
nine
thousand
men
strong
was
compelled
to
lay
down
its
arms
while
jellachich
with
his
remaining
forces
precipitately
fled
from
the
country
the
young
hungarian
army
had
thus
proved
itself
equal
to
the
task
of
repelling
the
attack
of
the
croats
but
the
recent
events
were
nevertheless
fraught
with
the
gravest
consequences
the
news
of
the
croatian
invasion
filled
the
hungarians
with
deep
anxiety
and
the
extraordinary
excitement
caused
by
it
cast
a
permanent
cloud
over
the
soul
of
that
great
and
noble
man
count
szechenyi
the
mind
of
the
great
patriot
who
had
initiated
the
national
movement
gave
way
under
the
strain
of
the
frightful
rumors
coming
from
the
croatian
frontier
he
had
been
ailing
for
some
time
and
his
nervousness
increased
so
greatly
under
the
pressure
of
the
great
events
following
one
another
in
rapid
succession
that
when
the
news
came
that
the
enemy
had
invaded
the
country
he
thought
hungary
was
lost
his
despair
darkened
his
mind
and
he
sought
death
in
the
waves
of
the
danube
his
family
removed
him
to
a
private
asylum
near
vienna
where
he
recovered
his
mental
faculties
and
even
wrote
several
books
but
he
was
never
entirely
cured
of
his
hallucination
and
exasperated
by
the
vexations
he
was
subjected
to
by
the
viennese
government
even
in
the
asylum
the
great
patriot
put
an
end
to
his
own
life
on
april
by
a
jellachich
incursion
had
other
important
political
consequences
the
attack
on
hungary
had
been
made
by
jellachich
in
the
name
of
the
viennese
government
and
the
intimate
connection
between
the
domestic
disorders
and
the
court
of
vienna
became
more
and
more
apparent
this
state
of
things
rendered
inevitable
a
struggle
between
hungary
and
the
unconstitutional
action
of
the
court
the
austrian
forces
were
arming
against
hungary
on
every
side
vienna
too
rose
in
rebellion
against
the
court
and
now
the
hungarians
hastened
to
assist
the
revolutionists
in
the
austrian
capital
unfortunately
the
young
national
army
was
not
ripe
yet
for
so
great
a
military
enterprise
and
prince
windischgraetz
having
crushed
the
revolution
in
vienna
invaded
hungary
a
last
attempt
was
now
made
by
the
hungarians
to
negotiate
peace
with
the
court
but
it
failed
windischgraetz
being
so
elated
with
his
success
that
nothing
short
of
unconditional
submission
on
the
part
of
the
country
would
satisfy
him
to
accept
such
terms
would
have
been
both
cowardly
and
suicidal
and
the
nation
therefore
driven
to
the
sad
alternative
of
war
determined
rather
to
perish
gloriously
than
pusillanimously
to
submit
to
be
enslaved
by
the
court
they
followed
the
lead
of
kossuth
who
was
now
at
the
head
of
the
government
while
gorgei
was
the
of
the
hungarian
army
the
two
names
of
kossuth
and
gorgei
soon
constituted
the
glory
of
the
nation
while
these
two
acted
in
harmony
they
achieved
brilliant
triumphs
but
their
personal
antagonism
greatly
contributed
at
a
subsequent
period
to
the
calamities
of
the
country
windischgraetz
took
possession
of
buda
in
january
thus
compelling
kossuth
to
transfer
the
seat
of
government
to
debreczin
while
gorgei
withdrew
with
his
army
to
the
northern
part
of
hungary
but
the
national
army
fought
victoriously
against
the
serbs
and
wallachs
and
the
situation
of
the
hungarians
had
in
the
course
of
the
winter
become
more
favorable
all
over
the
country
the
genius
of
kossuth
brought
again
and
again
as
if
by
magic
fresh
armies
into
the
field
and
he
was
indefatigable
in
organizing
the
defence
of
the
country
distinguished
generals
like
gorgei
klapka
damjanics
and
bem
transformed
the
raw
recruits
in
a
wonderfully
short
time
into
properly
disciplined
troops
who
were
able
to
hold
their
own
and
bravely
contend
against
the
old
and
tried
imperial
forces
whom
they
put
to
flight
at
every
point
the
fortunes
of
war
changed
in
favor
of
the
hungarians
in
the
latter
part
of
january
klapka
achieved
the
first
triumph
which
was
followed
by
the
brilliant
victory
won
by
one
of
gorgei
divisions
commanded
by
guyon
in
the
battle
of
branyiszko
and
very
soon
the
hungarian
armies
acted
on
the
offensive
at
all
points
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
they
achieved
chiefly
under
gorgei
leadership
great
and
complete
victories
over
the
enemy
near
szolnok
hatvan
bicske
waitzen
isaszegh
nagy
sarlo
and
komarom
windischgraetz
lost
both
the
campaign
and
his
office
as
toward
the
close
of
the
spring
of
after
besieged
komorn
had
been
relieved
by
the
hungarians
and
bem
had
driven
from
transylvania
not
only
the
austrians
but
the
russians
who
had
come
to
their
assistance
the
country
was
almost
freed
from
her
enemies
and
only
two
cities
buda
and
temesvar
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
austrians
the
glorious
efforts
made
by
the
nation
were
attended
at
last
by
splendid
successes
and
the
civilized
world
spoke
with
sympathy
and
respect
of
the
hungarian
people
who
had
signally
shown
their
ability
to
defend
their
liberties
constitution
and
national
existence
it
should
have
been
the
mission
of
diplomacy
at
this
conjuncture
to
turn
to
advantage
the
recent
military
successes
by
negotiating
an
honorable
peace
with
the
humbled
dynasty
as
had
been
done
before
in
the
history
of
the
country
after
similar
military
achievements
by
the
ancient
national
leaders
bocskay
and
bethlen
gorgei
at
the
head
of
the
army
was
disposed
to
conclude
peace
but
the
hungarian
parliament
sitting
in
debreczin
led
by
kossuth
and
under
the
influence
of
the
recent
victories
was
determined
to
pursue
a
different
course
the
royal
house
at
hapsburg
whose
dynasty
had
ruled
over
hungary
for
three
centuries
was
declared
to
have
forfeited
its
right
to
the
throne
by
instigating
and
bringing
upon
the
country
the
calamities
of
a
great
war
this
act
had
a
bad
effect
especially
on
the
army
tending
also
to
heighten
the
personal
antagonism
between
kossuth
and
gorgei
but
its
worst
consequence
was
that
it
gave
russia
a
pretext
for
armed
intervention
the
emperor
francis
joseph
entered
into
an
alliance
with
the
czar
of
russia
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
reconquer
seceded
hungary
and
ultimately
to
crush
her
liberty
one
more
brilliant
victory
was
achieved
by
the
hungarian
arms
before
the
fatal
blow
was
aimed
at
the
country
the
fortress
of
buda
was
taken
after
a
gallant
assault
in
the
course
of
which
the
austrian
commandant
bombarded
the
defenceless
city
of
pest
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
danube
and
thus
the
capital
too
was
restored
to
the
country
yet
after
this
last
glorious
feat
of
war
good
fortune
deserted
the
national
banners
the
grand
heroic
epoch
was
hastening
to
its
tragic
end
two
hundred
thousand
russians
crossed
the
borders
of
hungary
and
were
there
reënforced
by
sixty
thousand
to
seventy
thousand
austrians
whom
the
viennese
government
had
succeeded
in
collecting
for
a
last
great
effort
it
was
easy
to
foresee
that
the
exhausted
hungarian
army
could
not
long
resist
the
superior
numbers
opposed
to
them
for
months
they
continued
the
gallant
fight
and
in
one
of
these
fierce
engagements
petofi
the
beloved
poet
of
the
nation
lost
his
life
but
in
the
month
of
august
the
russians
had
already
succeeded
in
surrounding
gorgei
army
gorgei
who
was
now
invested
with
the
supreme
power
perceiving
that
all
further
effusion
of
blood
was
useless
surrendered
in
the
sight
of
the
russian
army
the
sword
he
had
so
gloriously
worn
in
many
a
battle
near
vilagos
on
august
the
remaining
hungarian
armies
followed
his
example
and
either
capitulated
or
disbanded
the
brave
army
of
the
was
no
more
and
the
gallant
struggle
for
liberty
was
put
an
end
to
by
the
russian
forces
kossuth
and
many
other
hungarians
sought
refuge
in
turkey
above
komorn
the
largest
fortress
in
the
country
alone
the
hungarian
colors
were
still
floating
general
klapka
its
commandant
bravely
defended
it
and
continued
to
hold
it
for
six
weeks
after
the
sad
catastrophe
of
vilagos
the
brave
defender
seeing
at
last
that
further
resistance
served
no
purpose
as
the
hungarian
army
had
ceased
to
exist
and
the
whole
country
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
austrians
capitulated
upon
the
most
honorable
terms
this
was
the
concluding
act
of
the
heroic
struggle
of
the
hungarian
people
the
brave
attitude
of
the
garrison
and
their
commander
adding
another
bright
page
to
the
honorable
record
of
the
military
achievements
of
and
as
soon
as
the
imperialists
had
obtained
possession
of
komorn
their
baron
haynau
began
to
persecute
the
patriots
and
to
commit
the
most
cruel
atrocities
against
them
those
who
had
taken
part
in
the
national
war
were
brought
before
a
and
summarily
executed
the
bloody
work
of
the
executioner
began
on
october
count
louis
batthyanyi
was
shot
at
pest
and
thirteen
gallant
generals
belonging
to
gorgei
army
met
their
deaths
at
arad
wholesale
massacres
were
committed
throughout
the
country
until
at
last
the
conscience
of
europe
rose
up
against
these
cruel
butcheries
and
the
court
itself
removed
the
sanguinary
baron
from
the
scene
of
his
inhuman
exploits
the
best
men
in
the
country
were
thrown
into
prison
and
thousands
of
families
had
to
mourn
for
dear
ones
who
had
fallen
victims
to
the
implacable
vindictiveness
of
the
austrian
government
once
more
the
gloom
of
oppression
settled
upon
the
unhappy
country
many
of
the
patriots
had
accompanied
kossuth
to
turkey
or
found
a
refuge
in
other
foreign
countries
and
for
ten
years
a
great
number
of
distinguished
hungarians
were
compelled
to
taste
the
bitterness
of
exile
kossuth
himself
went
subsequently
to
england
and
visited
also
the
united
states
in
the
latter
country
he
was
enthusiastically
received
by
the
great
and
free
american
people
who
took
delight
in
his
lofty
eloquence
during
the
crimean
war
and
the
war
of
in
italy
kossuth
and
the
hungarian
exiles
were
zealously
laboring
to
free
their
country
by
foreign
aid
from
the
thraldom
of
oppression
at
last
however
the
hungarian
nation
succeeded
in
reconquering
without
any
aid
from
abroad
by
her
own
exertions
her
national
and
political
rights
and
made
her
peace
with
the
ruling
dynasty
but
the
hungarian
exiles
had
their
full
share
in
the
work
of
reconciliation
for
it
was
owing
to
their
exertions
that
the
nations
of
europe
remembered
that
in
spite
of
vilagos
hungary
still
existed
and
that
again
at
home
the
people
of
hungary
were
not
permitted
to
lose
their
faith
in
a
better
and
brighter
future
kossuth
the
nestor
of
the
struggle
for
liberty
lives
at
present

retirement

kossuth
died
at
turin
italy
march
ed
and
although
separated
from
his
people
by
diverging
political
theories
his
countrymen
will
forever
cherish
in
him
the
great
genius
who
gave
liberty
to
millions
of
the
oppressed
peasantry
and
who
inscribed
indelibly
on

discovery
of
gold
in
california
john
hittell
before
the
time
of
the
great
gold
discovery
of
the
metal
had
been
found
in
california
but
the
mines
from
which
it
was
taken
were
poor
and
yielded
small
returns
for
years
of
working
the
discovery
in
influenced
the
whole
world
giving
new
life
to
trade
and
industry
everywhere
the
first
published
report
of
gold
in
california
appeared
in
hakluyt
account
of
sir
francis
drake
visit
to
the
coast
in
the
observations
of
drake
men
are
supposed
by
some
to
have
been
made
at
a
point
not
far
from
san
francisco
the
hakluyt
statement
however
is
disbelieved
by
many
historians
the
spaniards
and
mexicans
who
later
visited
the
coast
are
known
to
have
found
gold
at
many
places
and
especially
near
the
colorado
river
but
they
discovered
no
mines
worth
working
reports
of
great
mineral
wealth
in
california
were
repeated
up
to
the
time
of
the
american
conquest
but
they
commanded
little
confidence
among
mining
experts
although
gold
was
found
in
what
is
now
san
diego
county
in
alexander
forbes
the
historian
of
california
wrote
in
that
no
minerals
of
particular
importance
had
been
discovered
in
upper
california
nor
any
ores
of
metals
about
a
gold
placer
was
discovered
in
the
of
san
francisquito
miles
northwest
of
los
angeles
and
this
was
the
first
california
mine
that
produced
any
considerable
amount
of
metal
it
was
worked
for
ten
years
and
then
abandoned
for
richer
diggings
in
the
sacramento
valley
the
average
yield
for
the
ten
years
was
probably
about
six
thousand
dollars
after
the
return
of
the
wilkes
exploring
expedition
of
james
dana
its
mineralogist
mentioned
places
in
california
at
which
he
had
observed
or
inferred
the
existence
of
gold
but
his
report
led
to
no
and
had
only
a
scientific
interest
the
great
discovery
of
and
its
effects
are
described
in
the
following
account
by
hittell
which
forms
a
part
of
hubert
bancroft
voluminous
of
the
pacific
as
edmund
hammond
hargraves
is
the
hero
of
the
australian
so
is
james
marshall
of
the
californian
gold
discovery
before
giving
the
account
of
his
discovery
however
i
will
quote
the
following
passage
from
a
letter
written
on
may
by
thomas
larkin
then
united
states
consul
at
monterey
california
to
james
buchanan
secretary
of
state
there
is
said
to
be
black
lead
in
the
country
of
san
fernando
near
san
pedro
now
los
angeles
county
by
washing
the
sand
in
a
plate
any
person
can
obtain
from
one
dollar
to
five
dollars
per
day
of
gold
that
brings
seventeen
dollars
per
ounce
in
boston
the
gold
has
been
gathered
for
two
or
three
years
though
but
few
have
the
patience
to
look
for
it
on
the
southeast
end
of
the
island
of
catalina
there
is
a
silver
mine
from
which
silver
has
been
extracted
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
gold
silver
copper
lead
sulphur
and
coal
mines
are
to
be
found
all
over
california
and
it
is
equally
doubtful
whether
under
their
present
owners
they
will
ever
be
worked
james
marshall
in
a
letter
dated
january
and
addressed
to
charles
pickett
gave
the
following
account
of
the
gold
discovery
toward
the
end
of
august
captain
sutter
and
i
formed
a
copartnership
to
build
and
run
a
sawmill
upon
a
site
selected
by
myself
since
known
as
coloma
we
employed
weimer
and
family
to
remove
from
the
fort
sutter
fort
to
the
to
cook
and
labor
for
us
nearly
the
first
work
done
was
the
building
of
a
double
log
cabin
about
half
a
mile
from
the
we
commenced
the
mill
about
christmas
some
of
the
wanted
a
cabin
near
the
mill
this
was
built
and
i
went
to
the
fort
to
superintend
the
construction
of
the
leaving
orders
to
cut
a
narrow
ditch
where
the
race
was
to
be
made
upon
my
return
in
january
i
found
the
ditch
cut
as
directed
and
those
who
were
working
on
the
same
were
doing
so
at
a
great
disadvantage
expending
their
labor
upon
the
head
of
the
race
instead
of
the
foot
i
immediately
changed
the
course
of
things
and
upon
the
of
the
same
month
of
january
discovered
the
gold
near
the
lower
end
of
the
race
about
two
hundred
yards
below
the
mill
william
scott
was
the
second
man
to
see
the
metal
he
was
at
work
at
a
carpenter
bench
near
the
mill
i
showed
the
gold
to
him
alexander
stephens
james
brown
henry
bigler
and
william
johnston
were
likewise
working
in
front
of
the
mill
framing
the
upper
story
they
were
called
up
next
and
of
course
saw
the
precious
metal
weimer
and
charles
bennett
were
at
the
old
double
log
cabin
where
hastings
and
company
afterward
kept
a
store
in
the
mean
time
we
put
in
some
wheat
and
peas
nearly
five
acres
across
the
river
in
february
the
captain
captain
sutter
came
to
the
mountains
for
the
first
time
then
we
consummated
a
treaty
with
the
indians
which
had
been
previously
negotiated
the
tenor
of
this
was
that
we
were
to
pay
them
two
hundred
dollars
yearly
in
goods
at
yerba
buena
prices
for
the
joint
possession
and
occupation
of
the
land
with
them
they
agreeing
not
to
kill
our
stock
horses
cattle
hogs
or
sheep
nor
burn
the
grass
within
the
limits
fixed
by
the
treaty
at
the
same
time
captain
sutter
myself
and
isaac
humphrey
entered
into
a
copartnership
to
dig
gold
a
short
time
afterward
weimer
moved
away
from
the
mill
and
was
away
two
or
three
months
when
he
returned
with
all
the
events
that
subsequently
occurred
you
and
the
public
are
well
informed
this
is
the
most
precise
and
is
generally
considered
to
be
the
most
correct
account
of
the
gold
discovery
other
versions
of
the
story
have
been
published
however
and
the
following
from
an
article
published
in
the
coloma
in
the
latter
part
of
the
year
is
one
of
them
the
statement
was
evidently
derived
from
weimer
who
lives
at
coloma
that
james
marshall
picked
up
the
first
piece
of
gold
is
beyond
doubt
peter
weimer
who
resides
in
this
place
states
positively
that
marshall
picked
up
the
gold
in
his
presence
they
both
saw
it
and
each
spoke
at
the
same
time
that
yellow
stuff
marshall
being
a
step
in
advance
picked
it
up
this
first
piece
of
gold
is
now
in
the
possession
of
weimer
and
weighs
six
pennyweights
eleven
grains
the
piece
was
given
to
her
by
marshall
himself
the
dam
was
finished
early
in
january
the
frame
for
the
mill
also
erected
and
the
flume
and
bulkhead
completed
it
was
at
this
time
that
marshall
and
weimer
adopted
the
plan
of
raising
the
gate
during
the
night
to
wash
out
sand
from
the
closing
it
during
the
day
when
work
would
be
continued
with
shovels
etc
early
in
february
the
exact
day
is
not
remembered
in
the
morning
after
shutting
off
the
water
marshall
and
weimer
walked
down
the
race
together
to
see
what
the
water
had
accomplished
during
the
night
having
gone
about
twenty
yards
below
the
mill
they
both
saw
the
piece
of
gold
before
mentioned
and
marshall
picked
it
up
after
an
examination
the
gold
was
taken
to
the
cabin
of
weimer
and
weimer
instructed
to
boil
it
in
but
she
being
engaged
in
making
soap
pitched
the
piece
into
the
where
it
was
boiled
all
day
and
all
night
the
following
morning
the
strange
piece
of
stuff
was
fished
out
of
the
soap
all
the
brighter
for
the
boiling
discussion
now
commenced
and
all
expressed
the
opinion
that
perhaps
the
yellow
substance
might
be
gold
little
was
said
on
the
subject
but
everyone
each
morning
searched
in
the
race
for
more
and
every
day
found
several
small
scales
the
indians
also
picked
up
many
small
thin
pieces
and
carried
them
always
to
weimer
about
three
weeks
after
the
first
piece
was
obtained
marshall
took
the
fine
gold
amounting
to
between
two
and
three
ounces
and
went
to
san
francisco
to
have
the
strange
metal
tested
on
his
return
he
informed
weimer
that
the
stuff
was
gold
all
hands
now
began
to
search
for
the
of
all
evil
shortly
after
captain
sutter
came
to
coloma
and
he
and
marshall
assembled
the
indians
and
bought
of
them
a
large
tract
of
country
about
coloma
in
exchange
for
a
lot
of
beads
and
a
few
cotton
handkerchiefs
they
under
color
of
this
indian
title
required
of
all
the
gold
dug
on
their
domain
and
collected
at
this
rate
until
the
fall
of
when
a
mining
party
from
oregon
declined
paying
as
they
called
it
during
february
marshall
and
weimer
went
down
the
river
to
mormon
island
and
there
found
scales
of
gold
on
the
rocks
some
weeks
later
they
sent
henderson
sydney
willis
and
fifield
mormons
down
there
to
dig
telling
them
that
that
place
was
better
than
coloma
these
were
the
first
miners
at
mormon
island
marshall
was
a
man
of
an
active
enthusiastic
mind
and
he
at
once
attached
great
importance
to
his
discovery
his
ideas
however
were
vague
he
knew
nothing
about
he
did
not
know
how
to
take
advantage
of
what
he
had
found
only
an
experienced
could
understand
the
importance
of
the
discovery
and
make
it
of
practical
value
to
all
the
world
that
fortunately
was
near
at
hand
his
name
was
isaac
humphrey
he
was
residing
in
the
town
of
san
francisco
in
the
month
of
february
when
a
bennett
one
of
the
party
employed
at
marshall
mill
went
down
to
that
place
with
some
of
the
dust
to
have
it
tested
for
it
was
still
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
this
yellow
metal
really
was
gold
bennett
told
his
errand
to
a
friend
whom
he
met
in
san
francisco
and
this
friend
introduced
him
to
humphrey
who
had
been
a
in
georgia
and
was
therefore
competent
to
pass
an
opinion
humphrey
looked
at
the
dust
pronounced
it
gold
at
the
first
glance
and
expressed
a
belief
that
the
diggings
must
be
rich
he
made
inquiries
about
the
place
where
the
gold
was
found
and
subsequent
inquiries
about
the
trustworthiness
of
bennett
and
on
march
he
was
at
the
mill
he
tried
to
induce
several
of
his
friends
in
san
francisco
to
go
with
him
they
all
thought
his
expedition
a
foolish
one
and
he
had
to
go
alone
he
found
that
there
was
some
talk
about
the
gold
and
persons
would
occasionally
go
about
looking
for
pieces
of
it
but
no
one
was
engaged
in
mining
and
the
work
of
the
mill
was
going
on
as
usual
on
the
he
went
out
prospecting
with
a
pan
and
satisfied
himself
that
the
country
in
that
vicinity
was
rich
in
gold
he
then
made
a
rocker
and
commenced
the
business
of
washing
gold
and
thus
began
the
business
of
mining
in
california
others
saw
how
he
did
it
followed
his
example
found
that
the
work
was
profitable
and
abandoned
all
other
occupations
the
news
of
their
success
spread
people
flocked
to
the
place
learned
how
to
use
the
rocker
discovered
new
diggings
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
the
country
had
been
overturned
by
a
social
and
industrial
revolution
humphrey
had
not
been
at
work
more
than
three
or
four
days
before
a
frenchman
called
baptiste
who
had
been
a
in
mexico
for
many
years
came
to
the
mill
and
he
agreed
with
humphrey
that
california
was
very
rich
in
gold
he
too
went
to
work
and
being
an
excellent
prospector
he
was
of
great
service
in
teaching
the
newcomers
the
principles
of
prospecting
and
mining
for
gold
principles
not
abstruse
yet
not
likely
to
suggest
themselves
at
first
thought
to
men
entirely
ignorant
of
the
business
baptiste
had
been
employed
by
captain
sutter
to
saw
lumber
with
a
whipsaw
and
had
been
at
work
for
two
years
at
a
place
since
called
weber
about
ten
miles
eastward
from
coloma
when
he
saw
the
diggings
at
the
latter
place
he
at
once
said
there
were
rich
mines
where
he
had
been
sawing
and
he
expressed
surprise
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
so
experienced
in
as
he
was
but
he
afterward
said
it
had
been
so
ordered
by
providence
that
the
gold
might
not
be
discovered
until
california
should
be
in
the
hands
of
the
americans
about
the
middle
of
march
reading
an
american
now
a
prominent
and
wealthy
citizen
of
the
state
then
the
owner
of
a
large
ranch
on
the
western
bank
of
the
sacramento
river
near
where
it
issues
from
the
mountains
came
to
coloma
and
after
looking
about
at
the
diggings
said
that
if
similarity
in
the
appearance
of
the
country
could
be
taken
as
a
guide
there
must
be
gold
in
the
hills
near
his
ranch
and
he
went
off
declaring
his
intention
to
go
back
and
make
an
examination
of
them
john
bidwell
another
american
now
a
wealthy
and
influential
citizen
then
residing
on
his
ranch
on
the
bank
of
feather
river
came
to
coloma
about
a
week
later
and
he
said
there
must
be
gold
near
his
ranch
and
he
went
off
with
expressions
similar
to
those
used
by
reading
in
a
few
weeks
news
came
that
reading
had
found
diggings
near
clear
creek
at
the
head
of
the
sacramento
valley
and
was
at
work
there
with
his
indians
and
not
long
after
it
was
reported
that
bidwell
was
at
work
with
his
indians
on
a
rich
bar
of
feather
river
since
called
bidwell
bar
although
bennett
had
arrived
at
san
francisco
in
february
with
some
of
the
dust
the
editors
of
the
town
for
two
papers
were
published
in
the
place
at
the
time
did
not
hear
of
the
discovery
till
some
weeks
later
the
first
published
notice
of
the
gold
appeared
in
the
published
in
san
francisco
on
march
as
follows
in
the
newly
made
raceway
of
the
sawmill
recently
erected
by
captain
sutter
on
the
american
fork
gold
has
been
found
in
considerable
quantities
one
person
brought
thirty
dollars
worth
to
new
helvetia
gathered
there
in
a
short
time
california
no
doubt
is
rich
in
mineral
wealth
great
chances
here
for
scientific
capitalists
gold
has
been
found
in
almost
every
part
of
the
country
three
days
later
the
the
rival
paper
gave
the
following
account
of
the
discovery
we
were
informed
a
few
days
since
that
a
very
valuable
was
situated
in
the
vicinity
of
this
place
and
again
that
its
locality
was
known
mines
of
quicksilver
are
being
found
all
over
the
country
gold
has
been
discovered
in
the
northern
sacramento
districts
about
forty
miles
above
sutter
fort
rich
mines
of
copper
are
said
to
exist
north
of
these
bays
although
these
articles
were
written
two
months
after
the
discovery
it
is
evident
that
the
editors
had
heard
only
vague
rumors
and
attached
little
importance
to
them
the
of
march
says
so
great
is
the
quantity
of
gold
taken
from
the
new
mine
recently
found
at
new
helvetia
that
it
has
become
an
article
of
traffic
in
that
vicinity
none
of
the
gold
had
been
seen
in
san
francisco
but
at
sutter
fort
men
had
begun
to
buy
and
sell
with
it
the
next
number
of
the
bearing
date
april
contained
an
article
several
columns
long
written
by
doctor
fourgeaud
on
the
resources
of
california
he
devoted
about
a
column
to
the
minerals
and
in
the
course
of
his
remarks
said
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
at
present
to
make
a
correct
estimate
of
the
mineral
wealth
of
california
popular
attention
has
been
but
lately
directed
to
it
but
the
discoveries
that
have
already
been
made
will
warrant
us
in
the
assertion
that
california
is
one
of
the
richest
mineral
countries
in
the
world
gold
silver
quicksilver
iron
copper
lead
sulphur
saltpetre
and
other
mines
of
great
value
have
already
been
found
we
saw
a
few
days
ago
a
beautiful
specimen
of
gold
from
the
mine
newly
discovered
on
the
american
fork
from
all
accounts
the
mine
is
immensely
rich
and
already
we
learn
the
gold
from
it
collected
at
random
and
without
any
trouble
has
become
an
article
of
trade
at
the
upper
settlements
this
precious
metal
abounds
in
this
country
we
have
heard
of
several
other
newly
discovered
mines
of
gold
but
as
these
reports
are
not
yet
authenticated
we
shall
pass
over
them
however
it
is
well
known
that
there
is
a
placer
of
gold
a
few
miles
from
los
angeles
and
another
on
the
san
joaquin
it
was
not
until
more
than
three
months
after
marshall
discovery
that
the
san
francisco
papers
stated
that
had
become
a
regular
and
profitable
business
in
the
new
placers
the
of
april
said
from
a
gentleman
just
from
the
gold
region
we
learn
that
many
new
discoveries
of
gold
have
very
recently
been
made
and
it
is
fully
ascertained
that
a
large
extent
of
country
abounds
with
that
precious
mineral
seven
men
with
picks
and
spades
gathered
one
thousand
six
hundred
dollars
worth
in
fifteen
days
many
persons
are
settling
on
the
lands
with
the
view
of
holding
preëmptions
but
as
yet
every
person
takes
the
right
to
gather
all
he
can
without
any
regard
to
claims
the
largest
piece
yet
found
is
worth
six
dollars
the
news
spread
men
came
from
all
the
settled
parts
of
the
territory
and
as
they
came
they
went
to
work
mining
and
gradually
they
moved
farther
and
farther
from
coloma
and
before
the
rainy
reason
had
commenced
in
december
miners
were
washing
rich
auriferous
dirt
all
along
the
western
slope
of
the
sierra
nevada
from
the
feather
to
the
tuolumne
river
a
distance
of
one
hundred
fifty
miles
and
also
over
a
space
of
about
fifteen
miles
square
near
the
place
now
known
as
the
town
of
shasta
in
the
coast
mountains
at
the
head
of
the
sacramento
valley
the
whole
country
had
been
turned
towns
had
been
deserted
or
left
only
to
the
women
and
children
fields
had
been
left
unreaped
herds
of
cattle
went
without
anyone
to
care
for
them
but
which
had
become
the
great
interest
of
the
country
was
not
neglected
the
people
learned
rapidly
and
worked
hard
in
the
latter
part
of
adventurers
began
to
arrive
from
oregon
the
sandwich
islands
and
mexico
the
winter
found
the
miners
with
very
little
preparation
but
most
of
them
were
accustomed
to
a
rough
manner
of
life
in
the
western
wilds
and
they
considered
their
large
profits
an
abundant
compensation
for
their
privations
and
hardships
the
weather
was
so
mild
in
december
and
january
that
they
could
work
almost
as
well
as
in
the
summer
and
the
rain
gave
them
facilities
for
washing
such
as
they
could
not
have
in
the
dry
season
in
september
the
first
rumors
of
the
gold
discovery
began
to
reach
new
york
in
october
they
attracted
attention
in
november
people
looked
with
interest
for
new
reports
in
december
the
news
gained
general
credence
and
a
great
excitement
arose
preparations
were
made
for
a
migration
to
california
by
somebody
in
nearly
every
town
in
the
united
states
the
great
body
of
the
emigrants
went
either
across
the
plains
with
ox
or
mule
teams
or
round
cape
horn
in
a
few
took
passage
in
the
steamer
by
way
of
panama
not
fewer
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
representing
in
their
nativity
every
state
in
the
union
went
to
california
that
year
of
these
twenty
thousand
crossed
the
continent
by
way
of
the
south
pass
and
nearly
all
of
them
started
from
the
missouri
river
between
independence
and
joseph
in
the
month
of
may
they
formed
an
army
in
daytime
their
trains
filled
up
the
roads
for
miles
and
at
night
their
glittered
in
every
direction
about
the
places
blessed
with
grass
and
water
the
excitement
continued
from
to
emigrants
continued
to
come
by
land
and
sea
from
europe
and
america
and
in
the
last
named
year
from
china
also
in
the
migration
fell
off
and
since
that
time
until
the
completion
of
the
union
pacific
railroad
california
received
the
chief
accessions
to
her
white
population
by
the
panama
steamers
the
whole
world
felt
a
beneficent
influence
from
the
great
gold
yield
of
the
sacramento
basin
labor
rose
in
value
and
industry
was
stimulated
from
louis
to
constantinople
the
news
however
was
not
welcome
to
all
classes
many
of
the
capitalists
feared
that
gold
would
soon
be
so
abundant
as
to
be
worthless
and
european
statesmen
feared
the
power
to
be
gained
by
the
arrogant
and
turbulent
democracy
of
the
new
world
the
author
of
a
book
entitled
on
the
gold
published
in
london
in
thus
speaks
of
the
fears
excited
in
europe
on
the
first
great
influx
of
gold
from
the
californian
mines
among
the
many
extraordinary
incidents
connected
with
the
californian
discoveries
was
the
alarm
communicated
to
many
classes
and
which
was
not
confined
to
individuals
but
invaded
governments
the
first
announcement
spread
alarm
but
as
the
cargoes
of
gold
rose
from
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
one
million
dollars
bankers
and
financiers
began
seriously
to
prepare
for
an
expected
crisis
in
england
and
the
united
states
the
panic
was
confined
to
a
few
but
on
the
continent
of
europe
every
government
rich
or
poor
thought
it
needful
to
make
provision
against
the
threatened
evils
an
immediate
alteration
in
prices
was
looked
for
money
was
to
become
so
abundant
that
all
ordinary
commodities
were
to
rise
but
more
especially
the
proportion
between
gold
and
silver
was
to
be
disturbed
some
thinking
that
the
latter
might
become
the
dearer
metal
the
governments
of
france
holland
and
russia
in
particular
turned
their
attention
to
the
monetary
question
and
in
the
government
of
holland
availed
themselves
of
a
law
which
had
not
before
been
put
in
operation
to
take
immediate
steps
for
selling
off
the
gold
in
the
bank
of
amsterdam
at
what
they
supposed
to
be
the
highest
prices
and
to
stock
themselves
with
silver
palladium
which
is
likewise
a
superior
white
metal
was
held
more
firmly
and
expectations
were
entertained
that
it
would
become
available
for
plating
the
stock
however
was
small
the
silver
operation
was
carried
on
concurrent
with
a
supply
of
bullion
to
russia
for
a
loan
a
demand
for
silver
in
austria
and
for
shipment
to
india
and
it
did
really
produce
an
effect
on
the
silver
market
which
many
mistook
for
the
influence
of
californian
gold
the
particular
way
in
which
the
netherlands
operations
were
carried
on
was
especially
calculated
to
produce
the
greatest
disturbance
of
prices
the
pieces
were
sent
to
paris
coined
there
into
napoleons
and
silver
pieces
drawn
out
in
their
place
at
paris
the
premium
on
gold
in
a
few
months
fell
from
nearly
per
cent
to
a
discount
and
at
hamburg
a
like
fall
took
place
in
london
the
great
silver
market
silver
rose
between
the
autumn
and
the
new
year
from
five
shillings
per
ounce
to
five
shillings
one
and
pence
per
ounce
and
mexican
dollars
from
four
shillings
ten
and
pence
to
four
shillings
eleven
and
pence
per
ounce
nor
did
prices
recover
until
toward
the
end
of
the
year
when
the
fall
was
as
sudden
as
the
rise
in
the
spring
of
reading
crossed
the
coast
range
with
a
party
of
his
indians
and
discovered
rich
diggings
in
the
valley
of
the
trinity
in
the
summer
of
the
same
year
colonel
frémont
discovered
the
mines
on
his
ranch
in
the
valley
of
the
mariposa
rise
and
fall
of
the
roman
republic
jessie
white
mario
when
young
italy
the
association
of
republican
agitators
led
by
giuseppe
mazzini
began
its
activities
about
hatred
of
the
austrian
government
which
ruled
in
several
of
the
italian
states
was
kept
alive
through
this
determined
organization
aspirations
for
liberty
and
were
requickened
the
endeavors
of
the
reforming
pope
pius
ix
to
harmonize
his
policy
with
the
aims
of
this
party
in
order
to
promote
a
confederation
of
the
italian
states
under
papal
supremacy
at
first
seemed
to
promise
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
soon
after
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
of
in
france
revolt
against
the
austrian
power
began
in
various
parts
of
italy
the
austrian
troops
were
driven
out
of
lombardy
venice
compelled
the
austrian
forces
in
her
territory
to
surrender
and
became
a
free
republic
in
a
short
time
italy
appeared
to
have
delivered
herself
from
the
rule
of
austria
but
almost
immediately
the
foreign
power
began
to
regain
its
ascendency
and
this
through
the
events
here
related
was
fully
recovered
after
the
flight
of
pius
ix
from
rome
november
mazzini
and
his
followers
pursued
their
own
course
a
constituent
assembly
was
summoned
and
on
february
it
declared
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
abolished
the
italian
soldier
who
now
becomes
the
chief
figure
of
this
movement
has
enjoyed
a
popular
renown
unsurpassed
by
that
of
any
of
his
countrymen
giuseppe
garibaldi
a
sailor
son
was
born
in
nice
july
in
youth
he
went
to
sea
in
he
took
part
with
mazzini
in
the
young
italy
demonstrations
and
for
aiding
in
an
attempt
to
seize
genoa
he
was
condemned
to
death
escaping
to
south
america
he
won
distinction
as
a
guerilla
leader
and
a
privateer
in
the
service
of
the
rio
grande
rebels
against
brazil
after
further
military
adventures
in
south
america
he
returned
to
italy
and
in
offered
his
services
to
pope
pius
ix
but
they
were
not
accepted
in
he
received
indifferent
treatment
at
the
hands
of
charles
albert
of
sardinia
who
was
besieging
the
austrians
in
mantua
after
the
failure
of
charles
albert
garibaldi
collected
his
own
followers
and
acted
against
the
austrians
with
such
effect
as
to
bring
him
into
prominence
in
the
ranks
of
italian
patriots
the
following
account
of
the
siege
and
defence
of
rome
which
admiringly
presents
him
to
view
is
from
the
supplement
to
garibaldi
and
is
a
valuable
contribution
to
the
history
of
the
events
in
which
he
was
so
conspicuous
of
the
many
sublime
pages
traced
in
the
blood
of
italian
patriots
the
sublimest
in
our
eyes
is
that
of
the
defence
of
rome
no
writer
of
genius
has
yet
been
inspired
to
narrate
the
heroic
deeds
enacted
the
pain
privation
anguish
borne
joyfully
to

is
inferior
to
all
his
other
writings
the
entry
of
the
italian
army
into
rome
by
the
breach
in
porta
pia
has
cast
the
grand
defence
of
into
the
background
of
rash
attempts
and
futile
failures
in
these
brief
pages
we
give
merely
the
outline
of
the
drama
in
which
garibaldi
was
one
of
the
leading
actors
the
men
who
desired
a
republic
did
not
exist
as
a
party
in
rome
previous
to
the
flight
of
the
pope
but
there
existed
a
strong
national
party
who
as
they
had
worshipped
pio
nono
pius
ix
when
he
blessed
italy
and
the
banners
that
the
romans
bore
upward
to
the
holy
war
now
execrated
him
inasmuch
as
he
had
withdrawn
his
sanction
to
that
war
and
had
blessed
the
croats
and
the
austrians
who
were
butchering
the
italians
in
the
north
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
favoring
the
independence
and
unity
of
italy
and
remaining
at
the
same
time
the
supreme
head
of
the
universal
church
pio
nono
fled
for
protection
to
the
king
of
naples
there
he
declined
to
accept
from
the
king
of
piedmont
his
repeated
offers
of
protection
or
mediation
and
appealed
to
austria
alone
to
restore
him
absolute
in
rome
very
soon
afterward
the
archduke
of
tuscany
revoked
the
constituent
assembly
which
he
had
granted
and
followed
the
saintly
example
of
the
holy
father
so
that
tuscany
and
rome
were
alike
left
sheep
without
a
shepherd
in
the
roman
states
an
appeal
was
made
to
universal
suffrage
and
the
people
sent
up
deputies
known
chiefly
for
their
honesty
and
bravery
to
decide
on
the
form
of
government
to
assist
piedmont
in
her
second
war
against
austria
when
the
constituent
assembly
met
to
decide
on
the
form
of
government
mamiani
warned
them
that
only
two
rulers
were
possible
in
rome
the
pope
or
cola
di
rienzi
the
papacy
or
the
republic
garibaldi
who
had
organized
his
legion
at
rieti
was
elected
member
of
the
constituent
assembly
and
on
february
put
in
his
appearance
and
in
language
more
soldierlike
than
parliamentary
urged
the
immediate
proclamation
of
the
republic
but
the
debate
was
carried
on
with
all
due
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
minority
finally
on
february
of
the
one
hundred
deputies
present
all
but
five
voted
for
the
downfall
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
all
but
eleven
for
the
proclamation
of
the
republic
these
with
the
exception
of
general
garibaldi
and
general
ferrari
were
all
romans
filopanti
who
undertook
to
explain
the
state
of
affairs
to
the
roman
people
won
shouts
of
applause
by
his
concluding
words
we
are
no
longer
mere
romans
but
italians
this
sentence
sums
up
the
sentiments
of
all
of
garibaldi
who
after
recording
his
vote
returned
to
his
troops
at
rieti
and
drew
up
an
admirable
plan
for
attacking
the
austrians
bent
on
subjugating
the
roman
provinces
and
for
carrying
revolution
into
the
kingdom
of
naples
of
mazzini
who
so
far
from
having
imposed
on
the
romans
a
republic
by
the
force
of
his
tyrannical
will
was
during
its
proclamation
in
tuscany
striving
to
induce
guerrazzi
and
his
to
unite
with
rome
and
organize
a
strong
army
for
the
renewal
of
the
lombard
war
true
the
romans
mindful
of
all
they
owed
to
the
great
apostle
of
italian
unity
and
independence
proclaimed
him
roman
citizen
on
february
and
on
the
of
the
same
month
the
roman
people
with
nine
thousand
votes
elected
him
member
of
the
constituent
assembly
but
it
was
not
until
march
that
he
entered
rome
when
in
one
of
his
most
splendid
speeches
rising
above
parties
and
politics
he
called
upon
the
rome
of
the
people
to
send
up
combatants
against
austria
the
only
enemy
that
then
menaced
italy
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
induced
the
assembly
to
nominate
a
commission
for
the
thorough
organization
of
the
army
and
ten
thousand
men
had
quitted
rome
and
were
marching
up
to
the
frontier
to
place
themselves
at
the
orders
of
piedmont
when
alas
their
march
was
arrested
by
the
news
of
the
total
defeat
at
novara
of
the
abdication
of
charles
albert
and
the
reinauguration
of
austrian
rule
in
lombardy
genoa
whose
generous
inhabitants
arose
in
protest
against
the
disastrous
but
inevitable
treaty
of
peace
was
bombarded
and
reduced
to
submission
by
la
marmora
and
now
while
to
rome
and
to
venice
flocked
all
the
volunteers
who
preferred
death
to
submission
the
new
holy
alliance
of
continental
europe
took
for
its
watchword
the
restoration
of
the
pope
the
extinction
of
the
two
republics
of
venice
and
of
rome
austria
crossed
the
po
and
occupied
ferrara
marching
thence
on
bologna
the
neapolitan
troops
from
the
south
marched
upward
to
the
roman
frontier
even
spain
sent
her
contingent
to
fiumicino
but
only
when
it
was
known
that
the
french
republic
had
voted
an
expedition
with
the
specious
object
of
guaranteeing
the
independence
of
the
supreme
pontiff
did
the
romans
and
their
rulers
realize
that
the
existence
of
rome
and
her
newborn
liberties
was
seriously
menaced
garibaldi
wrote
from
rieti
in
april
an
enthusiastic
letter
worth
recording
here
brother
mazzini
i
feel
that
i
must
write
you
one
line
with
my
own
hand
may
providence
sustain
you
in
your
brilliant
but
arduous
career
mazzini
had
just
been
elected
with
armellini
and
saffi
triumvir
of
rome
and
may
you
be
enabled
to
carry
out
all
the
noble
designs
in
your
mind
for
the
welfare
of
our
country
remember
that
rieti
is
full
of
your
brethren
in
the
faith
and
that
immutably
yours
is
joseph
garibaldi
at
the
same
time
he
sent
a
plan
proposing
to
march
along
the
via
emilia
to
collect
arms
and
volunteers
proclaim
the
levy
in
mass
and
with
a
division
stationed
in
the
bolognese
territory
operate
in
the
duchies
unite
tuscan
ligurian
and
piedmontese
forces
and
once
more
assail
the
austrians
but
the
news
of
piedmont
defeated
genoa
bombarded
and
vanquished
convinced
him
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
the
disheartened
population
of
northern
italy
hence
he
next
proposed
to
cross
the
neapolitan
frontier
fling
himself
upon
the
royal
troops
and
seize
the
abruzzi
a
sensible
project
this
to
take
the
offensive
against
the
pope
defenders
but
before
the
triumvirate
could
come
to
a
definite
decision
it
was
known
that
the
french
troops
by
a
disgraceful
stratagem
had
landed
and
taken
possession
of
civita
vecchia
general
oudinot
entwining
the
french
flag
with
the
roman
tricolor
and
assuring
the
romans
that
they
only
came
to
secure
perfect
freedom
for
the
people
to
effect
a
reconciliation
with
pius
ix
but
the
people
had
no
desire
for
such
reconciliation
the
assembly
decreed
that
rome
should
have
no
garrison
but
the
national
roman
guard
that
if
the
republic
were
invaded
by
force
the
invaders
by
force
should
be
repelled
a
commission
of
barricades
established
the
people
flocked
to
erect
and
remained
to
man
them
the
national
guard
summoned
by
mazzini
all
answered
present
and
served
enthusiastically
throughout
the
siege
all
the
troops
dispersed
in
the
provinces
were
summoned
to
the
capital
and
garibaldi
and
his
volunteers
marched
into
the
city
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
populace
too
thankful
to
welcome
them
to
demur
at
the
strange
appearance
they
presented
now
that
garibaldi
military
and
naval
genius
is
fully
recognized
and
the
extraordinary
fascination
he
exercised
over
officers
and
men
the
enthusiasm
with
which
he
filled
whole
populations
whom
others
failed
to
stir
are
undisputed
many
historians
and
critics
have
expressed
their
astonishment
that
he
was
not
made
at
once
of
the
roman
forces
and
have
blamed
the
triumvirate
for
having
failed
to
recognize
in
the
hero
of
montevideo
the
good
genius
of
rome
such
critics
must
be
simply
ignorant
of
the
actual
condition
of
rome
and
her
government
there
existed
in
the
first
place
the
regular
roman
army
which
would
have
served
under
none
save
regular
generals
then
there
was
the
lombard
battalion
under
manara
whose
members
after
fifteen
months
of
regular
campaigning
were
thoroughly
drilled
and
disciplined
who
insisted
on
retaining
the
cross
of
savoy
on
their
belts
and
until
their
prowess
made
them
the
idols
of
the
romans
were
nicknamed
the
corps
of
aristocrats
little
did
they
imagine
when
they
kept
aloof
from
the
legion
that
before
three
months
were
over
their
young
hero
chief
would
resign
his
command
of
them
to
assume
the
delicate
post
of
head
of
staff
carlo
pisacane
educated
in
the
military
college
of
the
nunziatella
who
had
served
as
captain
in
the
foreign
legion
in
algiers
destined
later
to
become
the
pioneer
of
garibaldi
and
his
thousand
and
to
lose
his
life
in
the
attempt
while
recognizing
garibaldi
prowess
and
talents
as
a
guerilla
chief
in
his
military
history
of
severely
criticises
his
tactics
and
blames
his
sending
up
a
handful
of
boys
against
masses
of
the
enemy
and
censures
unhesitatingly
his
indiscipline
at
velletri
one
of
the
deputies
of
the
roman
constituent
wrote
to
the
triumvirate
begging
them
to
send
garibaldi
with
his
motley
crew
to
a
terrible
spot
called
for
del
diavolo
between
civita
vecchia
and
rome
on
no
account
to
allow
them
to
enter
the
city
as
they
are
quite
too
disorderly
now
they
had
committed
no
disorders
save
that
of
carrying
off
the
mules
and
horses
of
the
convents
but
when
we
think
of
the
wild
free
life
led
in
the
backwoods
of
america
of
how
they
recognized
no
law
save
their
commander
orders
how
little
used
he
had
been
to
receive
command
from
any
it
will
be
easily
understood
how
this
wild
tanned
quaintly
dressed
band
filled
the
inhabitants
of
the
towns
through
which
they
passed
with
terror
and
dismay
garibaldi
violent
tirades
against
priests
and
priestcraft
the
liberation
of
a
gang
of
miscreants
arrested
by
order
of
the
roman
government
had
not
prepossessed
men
of
order
and
of
discipline
in
his
favor
and
although
personal
contact
dispelled
all
unfavorable
prepossessions
one
sees
how
impossible
it
was
for
mazzini
to
place
him
in
the
position
which
he
would
himself
have
assigned
to
him
garibaldi
altered
in
nothing
his
south
american
modes
of
warfare
he
and
his
staff
in
red
shirts
and
ponchos
with
hats
of
every
form
and
color
no
distinctions
of
rank
or
military
accoutrements
rode
on
their
american
saddles
which
when
unrolled
served
each
as
a
small
tent
when
their
troops
halted
and
the
soldiers
piled
their
arms
the
general
and
all
his
staff
attended
each
to
the
wants
of
his
own
horse
then
to
securing
provisions
for
their
men
when
these
were
not
at
hand
the
officers
springing
on
their
barebacked
horses
lasso
on
wrists
dashed
full
speed
along
the
campagna
till
oxen
sheep
pigs
kids
or
poultry
in
sufficient
quantities
were
secured
and
paid
for
then
dividing
their
spoil
among
the
companies
officers
and
men
fell
to
killing
quartering
and
roasting
before
huge
fires
in
the
open
air
garibaldi
when
no
battle
was
raging
or
danger
near
if
in
the
city
selected
some
lofty
if
in
the
country
climbed
the
loftiest
peak
and
with
brief
minutes
of
repose
under
his
literally
lived
on
horseback
posting
his
own
pickets
making
his
own
observations
sometimes
passing
hours
in
perfect
silence
scanning
the
most
distant
and
minute
objects
through
his
telescope
ever
a
man
of
the
fewest
words
a
look
a
gesture
a
brief
sentence
sufficed
to
convey
his
orders
to
his
officers
when
his
trumpet
signalled
departure
the
lassos
served
to
catch
the
horses
grazing
in
the
fields
the
men
fell
into
order
and
marched
none
knowing
nor
caring
whither
save
to
follow
their
chief
councils
of
war
he
never
held
he
ordered
and
was
implicitly
obeyed
to
his
original
legion
were
added
some
of
the
finest
and
bravest
of
the
lombard
volunteers
who
had
learned
his
worth
after
the
armistice
while
boys
from
ten
to
fourteen
who
were
his
pride
and
delight
formed
his
band
of
hope
for
an
act
of
courage
a
man
would
be
raised
from
the
ranks
and
sword
in
hand
command
his
company
but
woe
to
him
if
he
failed
in
shouldering
a
musket
or
brandishing
a
bayonet
at
need
to
onlookers
this
legion
composed
at
first
of
but
one
thousand
men
seemed
a
wild
unruly
set
but
this
was
not
the
case
drunkenness
and
insubordination
were
unknown
among
the
ranks
woe
to
a
soldier
who
wronged
a
civilian
three
were
shot
for
petty
theft
during
the
brief
roman
campaign
still
while
garibaldi
felt
within
himself
his
own
superiority
to
those
around
mazzini
who
also
felt
it
might
as
well
have
proposed
an
indian
chief
to
command
the
roman
army
as
this
man
whom
in
later
years
no
soldier
in
europe
but
would
have
been
proud
to
call
again
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
grounds
on
which
france
explained
her
interference
was
the
imposition
by
foreigners
of
a
republic
on
the
roman
people
desirous
only
to
receive
the
pope
with
open
arms
that
austria
piedmont
and
the
ultramontane
faction
in
england
represented
the
roman
states
as
handed
over
to
the
demagogues
to
the
riffraff
of
european
revolutionists
hence
the
absolute
necessity
that
presented
itself
to
the
minds
of
the
triumvirs
for
filling
the
civil
and
military
offices
as
far
as
possible
with
citizens
of
rome
or
the
roman
states
unfortunately
no
capable
roman
existed
rosselli
was
chosen
as
the
least
incapable
but
throughout
garibaldi
was
regarded
as
the
soul
the
genius
of
the
defence
a
very
short
time
had
sufficed
for
mazzini
and
the
romans
to
come
to
so
perfect
an
understanding
that
no
exercise
of
authority
no
police
force
was
necessary
to
keep
order
in
the
city
as
the
french
english
and
american
residents
and
as
the
respective
consuls
repeatedly
affirmed
in
public
and
in
private
letters
oudinot
too
had
warning
from
his
own
consul
from
his
own
friends
within
the
city
of
all
the
preparations
of
the
resolute
determination
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
known
valor
of
many
of
the
combatants
in
past
campaigns
yet
to
all
such
remonstrances
he
answered
with
french
impertinence
italiens
ne
se
battent
and
clearly
he
had
imbued
his
officers
with
this
belief
at
dawn
on
april
starting
from
castel
di
guido
leaving
their
knapsacks
at
magnianella
the
officers
in
white
gloves
and
sheathed
swords
advanced
on
rome
taking
the
road
to
porta
cavallaggieri
sending
sharpshooters
through
the
woodlands
on
the
right

chasseurs
de

the
heights
to

left
avezzana
war
minister
from
the
top
of
the
cupola
of
san
pietro
in
montori
on
seeing
the
first
sentinel
advance
gave
the
signal
for
the
ringing
of
the
tocsin
which
brought
the
entire
populace
to
the
walls
the
roman
matrons
clustering
there
to
encourage
their
husbands
sons
and
brothers
to
the
fight
when
the
army
arrived
within
a
hundred
seventy
yards
from
the
wall
the
artillerymen
from
the
bastions
of
san
marto
fired
their
first
salute
to
which
the
chasseurs
de
vincennes
responded
so
well
that
the
roman
narducci
major
pallini
and
several
of
his
men
fell
mortally
wounded
at
their
guns
finding
themselves
under
a
from
the
walls
and
from
the
vatican
the
enemy
placed
a
which
did
deadly
mischief
to
the
besieged
who
lost
at
once
six
officers
numerous
soldiers
and
had
a
cannon
dismounted
to
boot
not
the
slightest
confusion
occurred
women
and
boys
carried
off
the
wounded
fresh
soldiers
took
the
place
of
the
fallen
compelling
oudinot
to
summon
both
his
brigades
and
plant
two
other
pieces
of
cannon
but
he
now
had
to
cope
with
an
enemy
whom
frenchmen
in
montevideo
envied
and
calumniated
who
to
himself
and
his
followers
was
as
yet
an
unknown
quantity
garibaldi
who
had
had
but
two
days
to
organize
his
men
and
take
up
position
had
at
once
perceived
the
importance
of
the
scattered
buildings
outside
the
gates
and
occupied
them
all
villas
woods
and
the
walls
surrounding
them
as
the
enemy
fell
back
from
the
first
assault
he
flung
his
men
upon
them
as
stones
from
a
sling
at
the
head
of
the
first
company
was
captain
montaldi
who
in
a
short
time
was
crippled
with
nineteen
bullets
yet
still
fought
on
his
knees
with
his
broken
sword
and
only
when
the
french
retreated
did
his
men
carry
him
dead
from
the
field
as
fought
his
company
so
fought
all
under
the
eyes
of
garibaldi
who
directed
the
fight
from
villa
pamphilli
then
summoning
his
reserve
himself
heading
the
students
who
had
never
seen
fire
but
who
had
given
each
to
the
other
the
consign
if
i
attempt
to
run
away
shoot
me
through
the
head
he
led
them
into
the
open
field
and
there
gave
them
their
first
lesson
to
the
cry
of
to
the
bayonet
to
the
bayonet
a
lesson
oft
repeated
since
a
cry
never
after
raised
in
vain
numbers
of
his
best
officers
and
soldiers
fell
but
never
a
halt
or
panic
made
a
pause
in
that
eventful
charge
until
in
full
open
fight
the
french
were
compelled
to
retreat
leaving
garibaldi
absolute
master
of
the
field
numbers
of
the
french
were
killed
and
wounded
others
hid
themselves
in
the
woods
and
vineyards
round
a
general
retreat
ensued
while
a
portion
continued
the
fire
to
protect
it
the
guns
had
to
be
carried
off
by
hand
as
four
horses
had
been
killed
and
at
this
retreat
up
to
castel
di
guido
general
oudinot
was
forced
to
assist
in
person
summing
up
his
losses
he
found
that
he
had
left
four
hundred
dead
upon
the
field
five
hundred
thirty
wounded
and
two
hundred
sixty
prisoners
he
had
besides
the
glory
of
depriving
the
roman
republic
of
two
hundred
fourteen
killed
and
wounded
officers
among
them
and
of
carrying
off
one
prisoner
ugo
bassi
the
chaplain
who
had
remained
behind
to
assist
a
dying
man
his
only
weapon
being
the
cross
of
which
the
french
were
the
knightly
protectors
garibaldi
first
thought
was
naturally
to
pursue
the
fugitives
to
castel
di
guido
to
pali
and
civita
vecchia
to
drive
them
in
his
own
forcible
language
back
to
their
ships
or
into
the
sea
for
this
he
demanded
strong
reënforcements
of
fresh
troops
but
the
government
of
rome
believing
that
it
sufficed
for
republican
france
to
know
that
republican
rome
did
not
desire
the
return
of
the
pope
that
it
was
not
governed
by
a
faction
was
resolved
unanimously
to
resist
all
invasion
decided
against
pursuit
sent
back
the
french
prisoners
to
the
french
camp
accorded
oudinot
demand
for
an
armistice
and
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
french
plenipotentiary
ferdinand
de
lesseps
for
the
evacuation
of
the
roman
territory
the
refusal
was
never
forgotten
never
forgiven
by
garibaldi
and
has
always
been
a
burning
question
between
the
exclusive
partisans
of
mazzini
and
garibaldi
in
whose
eyes
to
scotch
and
not
to
kill
the
snake
was
the
essence
of
unwisdom
it
is
also
maintained
by
many
garibaldians
that
an
victory
could
not
have
been
concealed
from
the
french
assembly
as
the
president
and
his
accomplices
did
manage
to
conceal
the
affair
of
april
and
that
had
the
people
and
the
army
in
france
known
what
a
humiliation
had
been
inflicted
on
their
comrades
they
would
have
insisted
on
the
recall
of
oudinot
and
that
thus
the
president
own
position
would
have
been
endangered
on
the
other
hand
mazzini
partisans
say
granting
what
remains
unproven
that
garibaldi
could
have
succeeded
in
driving
every
frenchman
back
to
his
ships
or
into
the
sea
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
louis
napoleon
bent
on
restoring
the
pope
and
thus
gaining
the
clergy
to
his
side
would
have
sent
reënforcements
upon
reënforcements
until
rome
should
be
vanquished
the
disputants
must
agree
to
differ
on
this
point
though
all
surely
must
allow
that
it
was
necessary
that
the
small
forces
at
the
disposal
of
the
republic
should
be
husbanded
for
the
repulse
of
others
besides
france
who
claimed
to
be
defenders
of
the
pope
austria
the
king
of
naples
and
even
spain
and
in
fact
a
neapolitan
army
with
the
king
at
their
head
had
crossed
the
roman
frontier
and
had
taken
up
positions
at
albano
and
frascati
whence
garibaldi
was
sent
to
oust
them
the
lombard
brigade
being
added
to
his
legion
this
neapolitan
formed
one
of
the
characteristic
episodes
of
the
roman
campaign
garibaldi
usually
lodged
his
men
in
convents
to
the
terror
and
horror
of
their
inmates
sending
them
thence
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
positions
and
harass
them
by
deeds
of
daredevil
courage
the
king
was
indeed
at
albano
whence
from
palestrina
garibaldi
marched
to
the
attack
which
would
probably
have
been
successful
had
he
not
been
suddenly
summoned
back
to
rome
as
the
movements
of
the
french
were
by
no
means
reassuring
however
a
fresh
truce
being
proclaimed
general
rosselli
with
garibaldi
under
his
orders
was
sent
out
again
in
full
force
against
the
neapolitans
not
a
wise
arrangement
this
as
the
volunteers
and
the
regulars
unless
at
different
posts
within
the
city
had
not
yet
united
in
harmonious
action
garibaldi
sent
by
rosselli
merely
to
explore
the
enemy
movements
finding
that
they
were
retreating
from
albano
gave
battle
to
a
strong
column
about
two
miles
from
velletri
without
giving
time
to
rosselli
to
come
up
with
the
main
body
so
the
neapolitans
got
into
velletri
barricaded
themselves
there
and
escaping
during
the
night
by
the
southern
gate
recrossed
the
neapolitan
frontier
the
king
foremost
in
the
van
rosselli
and
the
regulars
complained
loudly
that
this
disobedience
to
orders
had
prevented
them
from
making
the
king
of
naples
prisoner
the
garibaldians
maintaining
on
their
side
that
this
would
have
been
effected
had
the
regulars
thought
less
about
their
rations
and
come
to
the
rescue
when
first
they
heard
the
distant
shots
messengers
sent
by
the
generals
to
the
triumvirate
bore
the
complaints
of
each
rosselli
was
recalled
and
garibaldi
left
with
full
liberty
of
action
but
when
the
french
government
disavowed
their
the
patriotic
able
straightforward
de
lesseps
instructing
oudinot
to
enter
rome
by
fair
means
or
by
foul
sending
enormous
reënforcements
promising
to
follow
up
with
the
entire
french
army
if
necessary
what
could
they
do
but
recall
garibaldi
with
all
possible
despatch
was
it
not
a
proof
of
their
confidence
in
him
moreover
on
garibaldi
return
to
rome
mazzini
made
a
last
effort
to
induce
him
to
unburden
his
mind
at
least
to
himself
by
asking
him
in
writing
to
tell
him
frankly
what
were
his
wishes
here
is
the
laconic
answer
characteristic
of
the
writer
frank
and
unabashed
as
the
round
clear
handwriting
of
the
original
from
which
we
copy
rome
june
mazzini
since
you
ask
me
what
i
wish
i
will
tell
you
here
i
can
not
avail
anything
for
the
good
of
the
republic
save
in
two
ways
as
dictator
with
unlimited
plenary
powers
or
as
a
simple
soldier
choose
unchangingly
yours
giuseppe
garibaldi
again
garibaldi
disapproved
the
conduct
of
mazzini
and
the
triumvirate
because
they
refused
to
allow
any
acts
of
violence
against
religion
or
the
professors
of
religion
they
had
abolished
the
inquisition
and
used
the
edifice
to
house
the
people
driven
from
their
homes
by
the
siege
had
invited
and
aided
monks
and
nuns
to
return
to
their
homes
and
to
lead
the
life
of
citizens
but
they
had
not
allowed
the
confessionals
to
be
burned
in
the
public
a
wretch
named
zambianchi
who
some
inoffending
priests
was
severely
punished
for
thus
dishonoring
the
republic
and
humanity
moreover
the
easter
ceremonies
were
celebrated
as
usual
the
triumvirate
and
the
assembly
stood
among
the
people
in
the
church
and
in
the
square
to
receive
the
blessing
from
the
outer
balcony
of
peter
all
this
gave
umbrage
to
garibaldi
but
no
hypocrisy
and
much
wisdom
inspired
these
acts
in
the
first
place
the
triumvirate
and
especially
mazzini
the
most
religious
man
we
have
ever
known
were
well
aware
that
while
the
temporal
power
of
the
papacy
might
be
destroyed
by
fire
and
sword
the
spiritual
power
of
the
roman
catholic
hierarchy
could
be
extinguished
only
in
the
name
of
a
moral
law
recognized
and
accepted
as
being
higher
and
more
authoritative
than
any
other
intermediary
between
god
and
the
people
they
knew
that
ideas
can
be
vanquished
only
by
ideas
again
as
the
responsible
heads
of
the
roman
republic
the
triumvirs
were
wisely
careful
not
to
offend
the
hearts
and
consciences
of
catholics
abroad
finally
the
very
fact
that
with
four
armies
at
their
gates
life
its
feasts
and
fasts
its
workdays
and
holidays
could
go
on
as
usual
was
one
highly
calculated
to
strengthen
the
romans
faith
in
and
affection
for
the
new
government
no
crimes
were
committed
the
people
came
to
the
triumvirs
as
children
to
their
fathers
and
for
italians
a
very
remarkable
thing
they
not
only
paid
down
current
taxes
but
they
paid
up
arrears
from
garibaldi
brief
account
it
would
almost
seem
that
the
triumvirate
and
the
assembly
surrendered
rome
before
absolute
necessity
constrained
them
so
to
do
he
does
not
tell
us
how
when
the
french
had
actually
entered
rome
by
the
breach
he
alone
of
all
the
civil
and
military
commanders
refused
to
head
the
troops
to
attack
the
invaders
in
possession
he
gave
his
own
reasons
very
wise
ones
it
seems
to
us
in
writing
many
years
later
but
in
his
he
seems
to
have
forgotten
them
the
terrible
tidings
that
the
seventh
bastion
and
the
curtain
uniting
it
to
the
sixth
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
french
spread
through
the
city
the
triumvirate
had
the
tocsins
rung
all
the
houses
were
opened
at
that
sound
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
all
the
inhabitants
were
in
the
streets
general
rosselli
and
the
minister
of
war
all
the
officers
of
the
staff
mazzini
himself
came
to
the
janiculum
the
people
in
arms
massed
around
us
writes
garibaldi
in
a
short
record
of
the
siege
of
rome
clamored
to
drive
the
french
off
the
walls
general
rosselli
and
the
minister
of
war
consented
i
opposed
the
attempt
i
feared
the
confusion
into
which
our
troops
would
have
been
thrown
by
those
new
combatants
and
their
irregular
movements
the
panic
that
would
be
likely
by
night
to
seize
on
troops
unaccustomed
to
fire
and
which
actually
had
assailed
our
bravest
ones
on
the
night
of
the
i
insisted
on
waiting
for
the
daylight
he
here
narrates
the
daring
but
unsuccessful
attempt
of
the
lombard
students
who
flung
themselves
on
the
assailants
and
who
had
gained
the
terrace
of
casa
barberini
and
continues
but
at
daylight
i
had
counted
the
forces
with
which
we
had
to
contend
i
realized
that
another
june
would
bereave
me
of
half
of
the
youths
left
to
me
whom
i
loved
as
my
sons
i
had
not
the
least
hope
of
dislodging
the
french
from
their
positions
hence
only
a
useless
butchery
could
have
ensued
rome
was
doomed
but
after
a
marvellous
and
a
splendid
defence
the
fall
of
rome
after
such
a
siege
was
the
triumph
of
democracy
in
europe
the
idea
of
preserving
four
or
five
thousand
devoted
combatants
who
knew
me
who
would
answer
at
any
time
to
my
call
prevailed
i
ordered
the
retreat
promising
that
at
five
in
the
evening
they
should
again
advance
but
i
resolved
that
no
assault
should
be
made
from
this
and
other
writings
of
garibaldi
it
is
clear
that
from
the
night
of
june
he
considered
any
further
attempt
to
prevent
the
french
from
entering
rome
as
worse
than
useless
that
hence
he
refused
to
lead
the
remnants
of
his
army
to
butchery
on
the
breach
how
then
was
it
possible
for
mazzini
to
have
retarded
the
catastrophe
indefinitely
and
reserved
to
rome
the
glory
of
falling
last
after
venice
and
hungary
mazzini
beside
himself
with
grief
that
the
armed
people
had
not
been
allowed
to
rush
on
to
the
bastions
and
drive
the
french
from
the
walls
wrote
a
reproachful
letter
to
manara
then
chief
of
garibaldi
staff
and
this
patriot
here
seems
to
have
kept
the
peace
as
on
the
we
find
a
friendly
letter
from
garibaldi
to
the
triumvirate
in
which
he
proposes
to
leave
manara
in
rome
and
to
conduct
himself
a
considerable
number
of
his
men
out
of
rome
to
take
up
position
between
the
french
and
civita
vecchia
to
harass
them
in
the
rear
and
on
the
same
day
evidently
after
a
meeting
and
the
acceptance
by
mazzini
of
garibaldi
project
the
latter
writes
june
mazzini
i
propose
therefore
to
go
out
evening
send
me
morning
the
chief
who
is
to
assume
the
command
here
order
the
to
prepare
one
hundred
fifty
mounted
dragoons
who
with
the
fifty
lancers
will
make
up
two
hundred
horse
i
shall
take
eight
hundred
of
the
legion
and
shall
send
them
to
change
their
shirts
doff
their
for
answer
at
once
and
keep
the
plan
a
profound
secret
the
attempt
was
not
made
probably
because
it
was
impossible
to
march
out
secretly
from
any
gate
and
manara
writes
from
villa
spada
on
the
same
day
citizen
triumvir
i
have
received
your
letter
i
am
somewhat
better
and
at
my
post
i
have
spoken
with
pisacane
chief
of
rosselli
staff
we
are
perfectly
agreed
both
animated
by
the
same
spirit
it
is
impossible
for
petty
jealousies
to
come
between
us
be
assured
of
this
i
have
begged
general
garibaldi
to
return
to
san
pancrazio
so
as
not
to
deprive
that
post
at
this
moment
of
his
legion
and
his
efficacious
power
he
promises
me
that
before
dawn
all
will
be
here
everything
is
quiet
manara
this
was
manara
last
letter
to
mazzini
at
that
same
villa
spada
the
bullet
pierced
his
heroic
heart
manara
died
as
the
barbarians
entered
rome
and
here
to
all
appearances
is
garibaldi
last
letter
written
in
rome
to
mazzini
we
have
retaken
our
positions
outside
san
pancrazio
let
general
rosselli
send
me
orders
this
is
now
no
time
for
change
yours
g
garibaldi
no
time
for
anything
but
one
last
desperate
onslaught
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
garibaldi
in
the
foremost
ranks
with
sword
unsheathed
while
medici
from
villa
savorelli
renewed
the
wonders
of
the
vascello
twice
the
assailants
were
driven
back
to
their
second
lines
thrice
they
returned
in
overpowering
numbers
but
gaining
the
gate
they
were
received
with
volleys
of
musketry
from
the
barricades
at
the
ingress
to
villa
spada
and
savorelli
there
fell
the
flower
of

on
which
the

reconstructed
the
throne
of
the
supreme
pontiff
and
guarded
it
with

until
the

of

fell
from

and

although
africa
the
second
largest
grand
division
of
the
earth
has
figured
in
history
from
ancient
times
still
it
has
been
rightly
named
and
until
recently
was
called
with
good
reason
the
dark
continent
but
though
it
has
been
thus
designated
as
the
least
known
of
the
world
grand
divisions
the
progress
of
discovery
and
settlement
is
rapidly
dispelling
the
ignorance
and
mystery
to
which
the
designation
was
due
the
ancient
seats
of
african
civilization
were
confined
to
the
northern
parts
of
the
continent
the
phoenicians
are
said
to
have
circumnavigated
africa
as
early
as
the
seventh
century
before
christ
in
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
of
the
present
era
the
portuguese
explored
much
of
the
coastline
and
in
vasco
da

doubled
the
cape
of
good
hope
but
no
modern
explorations
of
the
interior
are
known
to
have
been
made
until
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
since
james
bruce
the
scottish
traveller
explored
the
nile
valley
in
more
than
thirty
others
have
distinguished
themselves
by
their
discoveries
on
the
african
continent
none
of
livingstone
predecessors
equalled
the
achievements
of
this
scottish
missionary
and
explorer
who
combined
with
his
zeal
in
the
cause

basin
david
livingstone
i
embarked
for
africa
in
and
after
a
voyage
of
three
months
reached
cape
town
spending
but
a
short
time
there
i
started
for
the
interior
by
going
round
to
algoa
bay
and
soon
proceeded
inland
and
spent
the
following
sixteen
years
of
my
life
namely
from
to
in
medical
and
missionary
labors
there
without
cost
to
the
inhabitants
the
general
instructions
i
received
from
the
directors
of
the
london
missionary
society
led
me
as
soon
as
i
reached
kuruman
or
lattakoo
then
their
farthest
inland
station
from
the
cape
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
north
without
waiting
longer
at
kuruman
than
was
necessary
to
recruit
the
oxen
which
were
pretty
well
tired
by
the
long
journey
from
algoa
bay
i
proceeded
in
company
with
another
missionary
to
the
bechuana
or
bakwain
country
and
found
sechele
with
his
tribe
located
at
shokuane
we
shortly
afterward
retraced
our
steps
to
kuruman
but
as
the
objects
in
view
were
by
no
means
to
be
attained
by
a
temporary
excursion
of
this
sort
i
determined
to
make
a
fresh
start
into
the
interior
as
soon
as
possible
accordingly
after
resting
three
months
at
kuruman
which
is
a
kind
of
head
station
in
the
country
i
returned
to
a
spot
about
fifteen
miles
south
of
shokuane
called
lepelole
now
litubaruba
here
in
order
to
obtain
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
language
i
cut
myself
off
from
all
european
society
for
about
six
months
and
gained
by
this
ordeal
an
insight
into
the
habits
ways
of
thinking
laws
and
language
of
that
section
of
the
bechuanas
called
bakwains
which
has
proved
of
incalculable
advantage
in
my
intercourse
with
them
ever
since
in
this
second
journey
to
lepelole
so
called
from
a
cavern
of
that
name
i
began
preparations
for
a
settlement
by
making
a
canal
to
irrigate
gardens
from
a
stream
then
flowing
copiously
but
now
quite
dry
when
these
preparations
were
well
advanced
i
went
northward
to
visit
the
bakaa
and
bamangwato
and
the
makalaka
living
between
and
south
latitude
the
bakaa
mountains
had
been
visited
before
by
a
trader
who
with
his
people
all
perished
from
fever
in
going
round
the
northern
part
of
these
basaltic
hills
near
letloche
i
was
only
ten
days
distant
from
the
lower
part
of
the
zouga
which
passed
by
the
same
name
as
lake
ngami
and
i
might
then
in
have
discovered
that
lake
had
discovery
alone
been
my
object
most
of
this
journey
beyond
shokuane
was
performed
on
foot
in
consequence
of
the
draught
oxen
having
become
sick
some
of
my
companions
who
had
recently
joined
us
and
did
not
know
that
i
understood
a
little
of
their
speech
were
overheard
by
me
discussing
my
appearance
and
powers
he
is
not
strong
he
is
quite
slim
and
only
appears
stout
because
he
puts
himself
into
those
bags
trousers
he
will
soon
knock
up
this
caused
my
highland
blood
to
rise
and
made
me
despise
the
fatigue
of
keeping
them
all
at
the
top
of
their
speed
for
days
together
till
i
heard
them
expressing
proper
opinions
of
my
pedestrian
powers
returning
to
kuruman
in
order
to
bring
my
luggage
to
our
proposed
settlement
i
was
followed
by
the
news
that
the
tribe
of
bakwains
who
had
shown
themselves
so
friendly
toward
me
had
been
driven
from
lepelole
by
the
barolongs
so
that
my
prospects
for
the
time
of
forming
a
settlement
there
were
at
an
end
one
of
those
periodical
outbreaks
of
war
which
seem
to
have
occurred
from
time
immemorial
for
the
possession
of
cattle
had
burst
forth
in
the
land
and
had
so
changed
the
relations
of
the
tribes
to
each
other
that
i
was
obliged
to
set
out
anew
to
look
for
a
suitable
locality
for
a
in
going
north
again
a
comet
blazed
on
our
sight
exciting
the
wonder
of
every
tribe
we
visited
that
of
had
been
followed
by
an
irruption
of
the
matabele
the
most
cruel
enemies
the
bechuanas
ever
knew
and
this
they
thought
might
portend
something
as
bad
or
it
might
only
foreshadow
the
death
of
some
great
chief
on
this
subject
of
comets
i
knew
little
more
than
they
did
themselves
but
i
had
that
confidence
in
a
kind
overruling
providence
which
makes
such
a
difference
between
christians
and
both
the
ancient
and
modern
heathen
as
some
of
the
bamangwato
people
had
accompanied
me
to
kuruman
i
was
obliged
to
restore
them
and
their
goods
to
their
chief
sekomi
this
made
a
journey
to
the
residence
of
that
chief
again
necessary
and
for
the
first
time
i
performed
a
distance
of
some
hundred
miles
on
oxback
returning
toward
kuruman
i
selected
the
beautiful
valley
of
mabotsa
latitude
south
longitude
as
the
site
of
a
and
thither
i
removed
in
here
an
occurrence
took
place
concerning
which
i
have
frequently
been
questioned
in
england
and
which
but
for
the
importunities
of
friends
i
meant
to
have
kept
in
store
to
tell
my
children
when
in
my
dotage
the
bakatla
of
the
village
mabotsa
were
much
troubled
by
lions
which
leaped
into
the
by
night
and
destroyed
their
cows
they
even
attacked
the
herds
in
open
day
this
was
so
unusual
an
occurrence
that
the
people
believed
they
were
bewitched
given
as
they
said
into
the
power
of
the
lions
by
a
neighboring
tribe
they
went
at
once
to
attack
the
animals
but
being
rather
a
cowardly
people
compared
to
bechuanas
in
general
on
such
occasions
they
returned
without
killing
any
it
is
well
known
that
if
one
of
a
troop
of
lions
is
killed
the
others
take
the
hint
and
leave
that
part
of
the
country
so
the
next
time
the
herds
were
attacked
i
went
with
the
people
in
order
to
encourage
them
to
rid
themselves
of
the
annoyance
by
destroying
one
of
the
marauders
we
found
the
lions
on
a
small
hill
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
and
covered
with
trees
a
circle
of
men
was
formed
round
it
and
they
gradually
closed
up
ascending
pretty
near
to
each
other
being
down
below
on
the
plain
with
a
native
schoolmaster
named
mebalwe
a
most
excellent
man
i
saw
one
of
the
lions
sitting
on
a
piece
of
rock
within
the
now
closed
circle
of
men
mebalwe
fired
at
him
before
i
could
and
the
ball
struck
the
rock
on
which
the
animal
was
sitting
he
bit
at
the
spot
struck
as
a
dog
does
at
a
stick
or
stone
thrown
at
him
then
leaping
away
broke
through
the
opening
circle
and
escaped
unhurt
the
men
were
afraid
to
attack
him
perhaps
on
account
of
their
belief
in
witchcraft
when
the
circle
was
we
saw
two
other
lions
in
it
but
we
were
afraid
to
fire
lest
we
should
strike
the
men
and
they
allowed
the
beasts
to
burst
through
also
if
the
bakatla
had
acted
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
they
would
have
speared
the
lions
in
their
attempt
to
get
out
seeing
we
could
not
get
them
to
kill
one
of
the
lions
we
bent
our
footsteps
toward
the
village
in
going
round
the
end
of
the
hill
however
i
saw
one
of
the
beasts
sitting
on
a
piece
of
rock
as
before
but
this
time
he
had
a
little
bush
in
front
being
about
thirty
yards
off
i
took
a
good
aim
at
his
body
through
the
bush
and
fired
both
barrels
into
it
the
men
then
called
out
he
is
shot
he
is
shot
others
cried
he
has
been
shot
by
another
man
too
let
us
go
to
him
i
did
not
see
anyone
else
shoot
at
him
but
i
saw
the
lion
tail
erected
in
anger
behind
the
bush
and
turning
to
the
people
said
stop
a
little
till
i
load
again
when
in
the
act
of
ramming
down
the
bullets
i
heard
a
shout
starting
and
looking
half
round
i
saw
the
lion
just
in
the
act
of
springing
upon
me
i
was
upon
a
little
height
he
caught
my
shoulder
as
he
sprang
and
we
both
came
to
the
ground
below
together
growling
horribly
close
to
my
ear
he
shook
me
as
a
terrier
dog
does
a
rat
the
shock
produced
a
stupor
similar
to
that
which
seems
to
be
felt
by
a
mouse
after
the
first
shake
of
the
cat
it
caused
a
sort
of
dreaminess
in
which
there
was
no
sense
of
pain
nor
feeling
of
terror
though
quite
conscious
of
all
that
was
happening
it
was
like
what
patients
partially
under
the
influence
of
chloroform
describe
who
see
all
the
operation
but
feel
not
the
knife
this
singular
condition
was
not
the
result
of
any
mental
process
the
shake
annihilated
fear
and
allowed
no
sense
of
horror
in
looking
round
at
the
beast
this
peculiar
state
is
probably
produced
in
all
animals
killed
by
the
carnivora
and
if
so
is
a
merciful
provision
by
our
benevolent
creator
for
lessening
the
pain
of
death
turning
round
to
relieve
myself
of
the
weight
as
he
had
one
paw
on
the
back
of
my
head
i
saw
his
eyes
directed
to
mabalwe
who
was
trying
to
shoot
him
at
a
distance
of
ten
or
fifteen
yards
his
gun
a
flint
one
missed
fire
in
both
barrels
the
lion
immediately
left
me
and
attacking
mebalwe
bit
his
thigh
another
man
whose
life
i
had
saved
before
after
he
had
been
tossed
by
a
buffalo
attempted
to
spear
the
lion
while
he
was
biting
mebalwe
he
left
mebalwe
and
caught
this
man
by
the
shoulder
but
at
that
moment
the
bullets
he
had
received
took
effect
and
he
fell
down
dead
the
whole
was
the
work
of
a
few
moments
and
must
have
been
his
paroxysms
of
dying
rage
in
order
to
take
out
the
charm
from
him
the
bakatla
on
the
following
day
made
a
huge
bonfire
over
the
carcass
which
was
declared
to
be
that
of
the
largest
lion
they
had
ever
seen
besides
crunching
the
bone
into
splinters
he
left
eleven
teeth
wounds
on
the
upper
part
of
my
arm
it
was
a
long
time
in
healing
the
exact
position
of
lake
ngami
had
for
half
a
century
at
least
been
correctly
pointed
out
by
the
natives
who
had
visited
it
when
rains
were
more
copious
in
the
desert
than
in
more
recent
times
and
many
attempts
had
been
made
to
reach
it
by
passing
through
the
desert
in
the
direction
indicated
but
it
was
found
impossible
even
for
griquas
who
having
some
bushman
blood
in
them
may
be
supposed
more
capable
of
enduring
thirst
than
europeans
it
was
clear
then
that
our
only
chance
of
success
was
by
going
round
instead
of
through
the
desert
on
july
we
went
forward
on
horseback
toward
what
we
supposed
to
be
the
lake
and
again
and
again
did
we
seem
to
see
it
but
at
last
we
came
to
the
veritable
water
of
the
zouga
and
found
it
to
be
a
river
running
to
the
northeast
a
village
of
bakurutse
lay
on
the
opposite
bank
these
live
among
batletli
a
tribe
having
a
click
in
their
language
and
who
were
found
by
sebituane
to
possess
large
herds
of
the
great
horned
cattle
they
seem
allied
to
the
hottentot
family
oswell
in
trying
to
cross
the
river
got
his
horse
bogged
in
the
swampy
bank
two
bakwains
and
i
managed
to
get
over
by
wading
beside
a
the
people
were
friendly
and
informed
us
that
this
water
came
out
of
the
ngami
this
news
gladdened
all
our
hearts
for
we
now
felt
certain
of
reaching
our
goal
we
might
they
said
be
a
moon
on
the
way
but
we
had
the
river
zouga
at
our
feet
and
by
following
it
we
should
at
last
reach
the
broad
water
when
we
had
gone
up
the
bank
of
this
beautiful
river
about
miles
from
the
point
where
we
first
struck
it
and
understood
that
we
were
still
a
considerable
distance
from
the
ngami
we
left
all
the
oxen
and
wagons
except
oswell
which
was
the
smallest
and
one
team
at
ngabisane
in
the
hope
that
they
would
be
recruited
for
the
home
journey
while
we
made
a
push
for
the
lake
twelve
days
after
our
departure
from
the
wagons
at
ngabisane
we
came
to
the
northeast
end
of
lake
ngami
and
on
august
we
went
down
together
to
the
broad
part
and
for
the
first
time
this
sheet
of
water
was
beheld
by
europeans
the
direction
of
the
lake
seemed
to
be
and
by
compass
the
southern
portion
is
said
to
bend
round
to
the
west
and
to
receive
the
teoughe
from
the
north
at
its
northwest
extremity
we
could
detect
no
horizon
where
we
stood
looking
west
nor
could
we
form
any
idea
of
the
extent
of
the
lake
except
from
the
reports
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
and
as
they
professed
to
go
round
it
in
three
days
allowing
miles
a
day
would
make
it
or
less
than
seventy
geographical
miles
in
circumference
other
guesses
have
been
made
since
as
to
its
circumference
ranging
between
seventy
and
one
hundred
miles
it
is
shallow
for
i
subsequently
saw
a
native
punting
his
canoe
over
seven
or
eight
miles
of
the
northeast
end
it
can
never
therefore
be
of
much
value
as
a
commercial
highway
in
fact
during
the
months
preceding
the
annual
supply
of
water
from
the
north
the
lake
is
so
shallow
that
it
is
with
difficulty
cattle
can
approach
the
water
through
the
boggy
reedy
banks
these
are
low
on
all
sides
but
on
the
west
there
is
a
space
devoid
of
trees
showing
that
the
waters
have
retired
thence
at
no
very
ancient
date
this
is
another
of
the
proofs
of
desiccation
met
with
so
abundantly
throughout
the
whole
country
a
number
of
dead
trees
lie
on
this
space
some
of
them
imbedded
in
the
mud
right
in
the
water
we
were
informed
by
the
bayeiye
who
live
on
the
lake
that
when
the
annual
inundation
begins
not
only
trees
of
great
size
but
antelopes
as
the
springbuck
and
are
swept
down
by
its
rushing
waters
the
trees
are
gradually
driven
by
the
winds
to
the
opposite
side
and
become
imbedded
in
mud
when
the
lake
is
full
the
water
is
perfectly
fresh
but
brackish
when
low
and
that
coming
down
the
we
found
to
be
so
clear
cold
and
soft
the
higher
we
ascended
that
the
idea
of
melting
snow
was
suggested
to
our
minds
we
found
this
region
with
regard
to
that
from
which
we
had
come
to
be
clearly
a
hollow
the
lowest
point
being
lake
kumadau
the
point
of
the
ebullition
of
water
as
shown
by
one
of
newman
barometric
thermometers
was
only
between
and
giving
an
elevation
of
not
much
more
than
two
thousand
feet
above
the

of
the

had
descended
above
two
thousand
feet
in
coming
to

from
kolobeng
it
is
the
southern
and
lowest
part
of
the
great
river
system
beyond
in
which
large
tracts
of
country
are
inundated
annually
by
tropical
rains
a
little
of
that
water
which
in
the
countries
farther
north
produces
inundation
comes
as
far
south
as
the
latitude
of
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
and
instead
of
flooding
the
country
falls
into
the
lake
as
into
a
reservoir
it
begins
to
flow
down
the
embarrah

divides
into
the

the
flow
begins

the

find

dried
out

thomas
hughes
before
the
middle
of
livingstone
was
ready
to
start
on
the
journey
which
resulted
in
the
opening
of
routes
from
central
africa
to
the
west
and
east
coasts
but
the
way
was
still
beset
with
difficulties
the
missionary
societies
were
regarded
as
unpatriotic
by
the
authorities
at
the
cape
and
he
as
the
most
outspoken
of
critics
and
the
most
uncompromising
denouncer
of
the
and
champion
of
the
natives
came
in
for
a
double
share
of
their
suspicion
on
the
other
hand
his
brethren
gave
him
only
a
support
and
doubted
his
orthodoxy
he
found
great
difficulty
even
in
procuring
ammunition
a
country
postmaster
whom
he
had
accused
of
overcharging
threatened
an
action
at
the
last
moment
which
he
compromised
rather
than
be
detained
as
it
was
he
had
anticipated
his
meagre
salary
by
more
than
a
year
and
had
to
be
content
with
very
inferior
oxen
and
a
wagon
which
required
constant
mending
throughout
the
journey
on
june
he
at
last
got
away
taking
with
him
a
fleming
the
agent
of
his
friend
rutherford
a
cape
merchant
in
the
hope
of
by
degrees
substituting
legitimate
traffic
for
that
in
slaves
the
heavy
cape
wagon
with
its
ten
poor
oxen
dragged
heavily
onward
livingstone
had
so
loaded
himself
with
parcels
for
stations
and
his
wagon
and
team
were
so
inferior
that
he
did
not
reach
kuruman
until
september
here
he
was
detained
by
the
breaking
of
a
wheel
the
journey
to
linyanti
by
the
new
route
was
very
trying
part
of
the
country
was
flooded
and
they
were
wading
all
day
and
forcing
their
way
through
reeds
with
sharp
edges
with
hands
all
raw
and
bloody
on
emerging
from
the
swamps
says
livingstone
when
walking
before
the
wagon
in
the
morning
twilight
i
observed
a
lioness
about
fifty
yards
from
me
in
the
squatting
way
they
walk
when
going
to
spring
she
was
followed
by
a
very
large
lion
but
seeing
the
wagon
she
turned
back
it
required
all
his
tact
to
prevent
guides
and
servants
from
deserting
everyone
but
himself
was
attacked
by
fever
i
would
like
says
his
journal
to
devote
a
portion
of
my
life
to
the
discovery
of
a
remedy
for
that
terrible
disease
the
african
fever
i
would
go
into
the
parts
where
it
prevails
most
and
try
to
discover
if
the
natives
have
a
remedy
for
it
i
must
make
many
inquiries
of
the
river
people
in
this
quarter
again
in
another
key
am
i
on
my
way
to
die
in
sebituane
country
have
i
seen
the
last
of
my
wife
and
children
leaving
this
fair
world
and
knowing
so
little
of
it
february
i
am
spared
in
health
while
all
the
company
have
been
attacked
by
fever
if
god
has
accepted
my
service
my
life
is
charmed
till
my
work
is
done
when
that
is
finished
some
simple
thing
will
give
me
my
quietus
death
is
a
glorious
event
to
one
going
to
jesus
their
progress
was
tedious
beyond
all
precedent
we
dug
out
several
wells
and
each
time
had
to
wait
a
day
or
two
till
enough
water
flowed
in
for
our
cattle
to
quench
their
thirst
at
last
however
at
the
end
of
may
he
reached
the
chobe
river
and
was
again
among
his
favorite
makololo
he
has
dropped
from
the
clouds
the
first
of
them
said
they
took
the
wagon
to
pieces
and
carried
it
across
on
canoes
lashed
together
while
they
themselves
swam
and
dived
among
the
oxen
more
like
alligators
than
men
sekeletu
son
of
sebituane
was
now
chief
his
elder
sister
mamochishane
having
resigned
in
disgust
at
the
number
of
husbands
she
had
to
maintain
as
chieftainess
poor
mamochishane
after
a
short
reign
of
a
few
months
she
had
risen
in
the
assembly
and
addressed
her
brother
with
a
womanly
gush
of
tears
have
been
a
chief
only
because
my
father
wished
it
i
would
always
have
preferred
to
be
married
and
have
a
family
like
other
women
you
sekeletu
must
be
chief
and
build
up
our
father
house
on
november
he
left
linyanti
and
arrived
at
loanda
on
may
the
first
stages
of
the
journey
were
to
be
by
water
and
sekeletu
accompanied
him
to
the
chobe
where
he
was
to
embark
they
crossed
five
branches
before
reaching
the
main
stream
a
wide
and
deep
river
full
of
hippopotami
the
chief
lent
me
his
own
canoe
and
as
it
was
broader
than
usual
i
could
turn
about
in
it
with
ease
i
had
three
muskets
for
my
people
and
a
rifle
and
shotgun
for
myself
my
ammunition
was
distributed
through
the
luggage
that
we
might
not
be
left
without
a
supply
our
chief
hopes
for
food
were
in
our
guns
i
carried
twenty
pounds
of
beads
worth
forty
shillings
a
few
biscuits
a
few
pounds
of
tea
and
sugar
and
about
twenty
pounds
of
coffee
one
small
tin
canister
about
fifteen
inches
square
was
filled
with
spare
shirts
trousers
and
shoes
to
be
used
when
we
reached
civilized
life
another
of
the
same
size
was
stored
with
medicines
a
third
with
books
and
a
fourth
with
a
magic
lantern
which
we
found
of
much
service
the
sextant
and
other
instruments
were
carried
apart
a
bag
contained
the
clothes
we
expected
to
wear
out
in
the
journey
which
with
a
small
tent
just
sufficient
to
sleep
in
a
sheepskin
mantle
as
a
blanket
and
a
horse
rug
as
a
bed
completed
my
equipment
an
array
of
baggage
would
have
probably
excited
the
cupidity
of
the
tribes
through
whose
country
we
wished
to
pass
the
voyage
up
the
chobe
and
the
zambesi
after
the
junction
of
those
rivers
was
prosperous
but
slow
in
consequence
of
stoppages
opposite
villages
my
man
pitsane
knew
of
the
generous
orders
of
sekeletu
and
was
not
disposed
to
allow
them
remain
a
dead
letter
in
the
rapids
the
men
leaped
into
the
water
without
the
least
hesitation
to
save
the
canoes
from
being
dashed
against
the
obstructions
or
caught
in
eddies
they
must
never
be
allowed
to
come
broadside
to
the
stream
for
being
they
would
at
once
be
capsized
and
everything
in
them
lost
when
free
from
fever
he
was
delighted
to
note
the
numbers
of
birds
several
of
them
unknown
which
swarmed
on
the
river
and
its
banks
all
carefully
noted
in
his
journal
one
extract
must
suffice
here
whenever
we
step
on
shore
a
species
of
plover
a
plaguy
sort
of
individual
follows
flying
overhead
and
is
most
persevering
in
its
attempts
to
give
warning
to
all
animals
to
flee
from
the
approaching
danger
but
he
was
already
weak
with
fever
was
seized
with
giddiness
whenever
he
looked
up
quickly
and
if
he
could
not
catch
hold
of
some
support
fell
heavily
a
bad
omen
for
his
chance
of
passing
through
the
unknown
country
ahead
but
his
purpose
never
faltered
for
a
moment
on
january
he
was
still
on
the
river
but
getting
beyond
territory
and
allies
to
a
region
of
dense
forest
in
the
open
glades
of
which
dwelt
the
balonda
a
powerful
tribe
whose
relations
with
the
makololo
were
precarious
each
was
inclined
to
raid
on
the
other
since
the
mambari
and
portuguese
had
appeared
with
manchester
goods
these
excited
the
intense
wonder
and
cupidity
of
both
nations
they
listened
to
the
story
of
as
fairy
dreams
exclaiming
how
can
iron
spin
weave
and
print
truly
ye
are
gods
and
were
already
inclined
to
steal
their
neighbors
children
those
of
their
own
tribe
they
never
sold
at
this
time
to
obtain
these
wonders
out
of
the
sea
happily
livingstone
had
brought
back
with
him
several
balonda
children
who
had
been
carried
off
by
the
makololo
this
and
his
speeches
to
manenko
the
chieftainess
of
the
district
and
niece
of
shinte
the
head
chief
of
the
balonda
gained
them
a
welcome
this
amazon
was
a
strapping
young
woman
of
twenty
who
led
their
party
through
the
forest
at
a
pace
which
tried
the
best
walkers
she
seems
to
have
been
the
only
native
whose
will
ever
prevailed
against
livingstone
he
intended
to
proceed
up
to
her
uncle
shinte
town
in
canoes
she
insisted
that
they
should
march
by
land
and
ordered
her
people
to
shoulder
his
baggage
in
spite
of
him
my
men
succumbed
and
left
me
powerless
i
was
moving
off
in
high
dudgeon
to
the
canoes
when
she
kindly
placed
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
with
a
motherly
look
said
my
little
man
just
do
as
the
rest
have
done
my
feeling
of
annoyance
of
course
vanished
and
i
went
out
to
try
for
some
meat
my
men
in
admiration
of
her
pedestrian
powers
kept
remarking
is
a
soldier
and
we
were
all
glad
when
she
proposed
a
halt
for
the
night
shinte
received
them
in
his
town
the
largest
and
best
laid
out
that
livingstone
had
seen
in
central
africa
on
a
sort
of
throne
covered
with
the
or
place
of
audience
was
one
hundred
yards
square
though
in
the
sweating
stage
of
an
intermittent
fever
livingstone
held
his
own
with
the
chief
gave
him
an
ox
as
his
mouth
was
bitter
from
want
of
flesh
advised
him
to
open
a
trade
in
cattle
with
the
makololo
and
to
put
down
the
and
after
spending
more
than
a
week
with
him
left
amid
the
warmest
professions
of
friendship
shinte
found
him
a
guide
of
his
tribe
intemese
by
name
who
was
to
stay
by
them
till
they
reached
the
sea
and
at
a
last
interview
hung
round
his
neck
a
conical
shell
of
such
value
that
two
of
them
so
his
men
assured
him
would
purchase
a
slave
soon
they
were
out
of
shinte
territory
and
intemese
became
the
plague
of
the
party
though
unluckily
they
could
not
dispense
with
him
altogether
in
crossing
the
great
flooded
plains
of
lebala
they
camped
at
night
on
mounds
where
they
had
to
trench
round
each
hut
and
use
the
earth
to
raise
their
sleeping
places
my
men
turned
out
to
work
most
willingly
and
i
could
not
but
contrast
their
conduct
with
that
of
intemese
who
was
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
slave
spirit
and
lied
on
all
occasions
to
save
himself
trouble
he
lost
the
pontoon
too
thereby
adding
greatly
to
their
troubles
they
now
came
to
the
territory
of
another
great
chief
katema
who
received
them
hospitably
sending
food
and
giving
them
solemn
audience
in
his
kotla
surrounded
by
his
tribe
a
tall
man
of
forty
dressed
in
a
coat
with
a
broad
band
of
tinsel
down
the
arms
and
a
helmet
of
beads
and
feathers
he
carried
a
large
fan
with
charms
attached
which
he
waved
constantly
during
the
audience
often
laughing
heartily
a
good
sign
for
a
man
who
shakes
his
sides
with
mirth
is
seldom
difficult
to
deal
with
i
am
the
great
moene
katema
was
his
address
i
and
my
fathers
have
always
lived
here
and
there
is
my
father
house
i
never
killed
any
of
the
traders
they
all
come
to
me
i
am
the
great
moene
katema
of
whom
you
have
heard
on
hearing
livingstone
object
he
gave
him
three
guides
who
would
take
him
by
a
northern
route
along
which
no
traders
had
passed
to
avoid
the
plains
impassable
from
the
floods
he
accepted
livingstone
present
of
a
shawl
a
razor
some
beads
and
buttons
and
a
graciously
laughing
at
his
apologies
for
its
smallness
and
asking
him
to
bring
a
coat
from
loanda
as
the
one
he
was
wearing
was
old
from
this
point
troubles
multiplied
and
they
began
to
be
seriously
pressed
for
food
the
big
game
had
disappeared
and
they
were
glad
to
catch
moles
and
mice
every
chief
demanded
a
present
for
allowing
them
to
pass
and
the
people
of
the
villages
charged
exorbitantly
for
all
supplies
on
they
floundered
however
through
flooded
forests
in
crossing
the
river
loka
livingstone
ox
got
away
from
him
and
he
had
to
strike
out
for
the
farther
bank
my
poor
fellows
were
dreadfully
alarmed
and
about
twenty
of
them
made
a
simultaneous
rush
into
the
water
for
my
rescue
and
just
as
i
reached
the
opposite
bank
one
seized
me
by
the
arms
and
another
clasped
me
round
the
body
when
i
stood
up
it
was
most
gratifying
to
see
them
all
struggling
toward
me
part
of
my
goods
were
brought
up
from
the
bottom
when
i
was
safe
great
was
their
pleasure
when
they
found
i
could
swim
like
themselves
and
i
felt
most
grateful
to
those
poor
heathens
for
the
promptitude
with
which
they
dashed
in
to
my
rescue
farther
on
the
people
tried
to
frighten
them
with
the
account
of
the
deep
rivers
they
had
yet
to
cross
but
his
men
laughed
can
all
swim
they
said
carried
the
white
man
across
the
river
but
himself
i
felt
proud
of
their
praise
on
march
they
reached
the
country
of
the
chiboques
a
tribe
in
constant
contact
with
the
next
day
their
camp
was
surrounded
by
the
nearest
chief
and
his
warriors
evidently
bent
on
plunder
they
paused
when
they
saw
livingstone
seated
on
his
with
his
gun
across
his
knees
and
his
makololos
ready
with
their
javelins
the
chief
and
his
principal
men
sat
down
in
front
at
livingstone
invitation
to
talk
over
the
matter
and
a
palaver
began
as
to
the
fine
claimed
by
the
chiboque
the
more
i
yielded
the
more
unreasonable
they
became
and
at
every
fresh
demand
a
shout
was
raised
and
a
rush
made
round
us
with
brandished
weapons
one
young
man
even
made
a
charge
at
my
head
from
behind
but
i
quickly
brought
round
the
muzzle
of
my
gun
to
his
mouth
and
he
retreated
my
men
behaved
with
admirable
coolness
the
chief
and
his
counsellors
by
accepting
my
invitation
to
be
seated
had
placed
themselves
in
a
trap
for
my
men
had
quietly
surrounded
them
and
made
them
feel
that
there
was
no
chance
of
escaping
their
spears
i
then
said
that
as
everything
had
failed
to
satisfy
them
they
evidently
meant
to
fight
and
if
so
they
must
begin
and
bear
the
blame
before
god
i
then
sat
silent
for
some
time
it
was
certainly
rather
trying
but
i
was
careful
not
to
seem
flurried
and
having
four
barrels
ready
for
instant
action
looked
quietly
at
the
savage
scene
around
the
palaver
began
again
and
ended
in
the
exchange
of
an
ox
for
a
promise
of
food
in
which
he
was
wofully
cheated
it
was
impossible
to
help
laughing
but
i
was
truly
thankful
that
we
had
so
far
gained
our
point
as
to
be
allowed
to
pass
without
shedding
blood
he
now
struck
north
to
avoid
the
chiboque
and
made
for
the
portuguese
settlement
of
cassange
through
dense
forest
and
constant
wet
here
another
fever
fit
came
on
so
violent
that
i
could
scarcely
after
some
hours
trial
get
a
lunar
observation
in
which
i
could
repose
confidence
those
who
know
the
difficulties
of
making
observations
and
committing
them
all
to
paper
will
sympathize
with
me
in
this
and
many
similar
instances
at
this
crisis
when
the
goal
was
all
but
at
hand
obstacles
multiplied
till
it
seemed
that
after
all
it
would
never
be
reached
first
his
riding
ox
sindbad
a
beast
blessed
with
a
most
intractable
temper
and
a
habit
of
bolting
into
the
bush
to
get
his
rider
combed
off
by
a
climber
and
then
kicking
at
him
achieved
a
triumph
in
his
weak
state
when
the
bridle
broke
and
down
i
came
backward
on
the
crown
of
my
head
receiving
as
i
fell
a
kick
on
the
thigh
this
last
attack
of
fever
reduced
me
almost
to
a
skeleton
the
blanket
which
i
used
as
a
saddle
being
pretty
constantly
wet
caused
extensive
abrasion
of
the
skin
which
was
continually
healing
and
getting
sore
again
then
the
guides
missed
their
way
and
led
them
back
into
chiboque
territory
where
the
demands
of
the
chief
of
every
village
for
a
man
an
ox
or
a
tusk
for
permission
to
pass
began
again
worst
of
all
signs
of
mutiny
began
to
show
themselves
among
the
batoka
men
of
his
party
who
threatened
to
turn
back
he
appeased
them
by
giving
them
a
tired
ox
to
be
killed
at
the
sunday
halt
having
thus
as
i
thought
silenced
their
murmurs
i
sank
into
a
state
of
torpor
and
was
oblivious
of
all
their
noise
on
sunday
the
mutineers
were
making
a
terrible
din
in
preparing
the
skin
i
requested
them
twice
to
be
more
quiet
as
the
noise
pained
me
but
as
they
paid
no
attention
to
this
civil
request
i
put
out
my
head
and
repeating
it
was
answered
by
an
impudent
laugh
knowing
that
discipline
would
be
at
an
end
if
this
mutiny
was
not
quelled
and
that
our
lives
depended
on
vigorously
upholding
authority
i
seized
a
pistol
and
darted
out
with
such
a
savage
aspect
as
to
put
them
to
precipitate
flight
they
gave
no
further
trouble
every
night
now
they
had
to
build
a
stockade
and
by
day
to
march
in
a
compact
body
knowing
the
forest
to
be
full
of
enemies
dogging
their
path
for
now
they
had
nothing
to
give
as
presents
the
men
having
even
divested
themselves
of
all
their
copper
ornaments
to
appease
the
chiboque
harpies
nothing
however
disturbed
us
and
for
my
part
i
was
too
ill
to
care
much
whether
we
were
attacked
or
not
they
struggled
on
the
chiboque
natives
now
joined
by
bodies
of
traders
opposing
at
every
ford
livingstone
no
longer
wondering
why
expeditions
from
the
interior
failed
to
reach
the
coast
some
of
my
men
proposed
to
return
home
and
the
prospect
of
being
obliged
to
turn
back
from
the
threshold
of
the
portuguese
settlements
distressed
me
exceedingly
after
using
all
my
powers
of
persuasion
i
declared
that
if
they
now
returned
i
should
go
on
alone
and
returning
into
my
little
tent
i
lifted
up
my
heart
to
him
who
hears
the
sighing
of
the
soul
presently
the
head
man
came
in
not
be
disheartened
he
said
will
never
leave
you
wherever
you
lead
we
will
follow
our
remarks
were
only
made
on
account
of
the
injustice
of
these
people
others
followed
and
with
the
most
artless
simplicity
of
manner
told
me
to
be
comforted
were
all
my
children
they
knew
no
one
but
sekeletu
and
me
and
would
die
for
me
they
had
spoken
in
bitterness
of
spirit
feeling
they
could
do
nothing
on
april
they
gained
the
ridge
which
overlooks
the
valley
of
the
quango
and
the
portuguese
settlements
on
the
farther
bank
the
descent
is
so
steep
that
i
was
obliged
to
dismount
though
so
weak
that
i
had
to
be
supported
below
us
at
a
depth
of
one
thousand
feet
lay
the
magnificent
valley
of
the
quango
the
view
of
the
vale
of
clyde
from
the
spot
where
mary
witnessed
the
battle
of
langside
resembles
in
miniature
the
glorious
sight
which
was
here
presented
to
our
view
on
the
they
were
close
to
the
quango
here
one
hundred
fifty
yards
broad
when
they
were
stopped
for
the
last
time
by
a
village
chief
and
surrounded
by
his
men
the
usual
altercation
ensued
livingstone
refusing
to
give
up
his
blanket
the
last
article
he
possessed
except
his
watch
and
instruments
and
sekeletu
tusks
which
had
been
faithfully
guarded
until
on
board
the
canoes
in
which
they
were
to
cross
i
was
trying
to
persuade
my
people
to
move
on
to
the
bank
in
spite
of
them
when
a
young
portuguese
sergeant
of
militia
cypriano
di
abren
who
had
come
across
in
search
of
beeswax
made
his
appearance
and
gave
the
same
advice
they
marched
to
the
bank
the
chief
men
opening
fire
on
them
but
without
doing
any
damage
made
terms
with
the
ferrymen
with
cypriano
help
crossed
the
quango
and
were
at
the
end
of
their
troubles
four
days
they
stopped
with
cypriano
who
treated
them
royally
killing
an
ox
and
stripping
his
garden
to
feast
them
and
sending
them
on
to
cassange
with
provisions
of
meal
ground
by
his
mother
and
her
maids
i
carried
letters
from
the
chevalier
du
prat
of
cape
town
but
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
my
friend
cypriano
was
influenced
by
feelings
of
genuine
kindness
excited
by
my
wretched
appearance
at
cassange
they
were
again
most
hospitably
treated
and
here
before
starting
for
loanda
three
hundred
miles
they
disposed
of
tusks
which
sold
for
much
higher
prices
than
those
given
by
cape
traders
two
muskets
three
small
barrels
of
powder
and
english
calico
and
baize
enough
to
clothe
my
whole
party
with
large
bunches
of
beads
were
given
for
one
tusk
to
the
great
delight
of
my
makololos
who
had
been
used
to
get
only
one
gun
for
two
tusks
with
another
tusk
we
purchased
calico
the
chief
currency
here
to
pay
our
way
to
the
coast
the
remaining
two
were
sold
for
money
to
purchase
a
horse
for
sekeletu
at
loanda
livingstone
was
much
struck
both
by
the
country
he
passed
through
and
the
terms
on
which
the
portuguese
lived
with
the
natives
most
of
them
had
families
by
native
women
who
were
treated
as
european
children
and
provided
for
by
their
fathers
clerks
sat
at
table
with
the
whites
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
nowhere
in
africa
is
there
so
much
between
europeans
and
natives
as
here
the
dizziness
produced
by
his
attacks
of
fever
on
the
road
made
it
all
he
could
do
to
stick
on
sindbad
who
managed
to
give
him
a
last
ducking
in
the
lombe
the
weakening
effects
of
the
fever
were
most
extraordinary
for
instance
in
attempting
to
take
lunar
observations
i
could
not
avoid
confusion
of
time
and
distance
neither
could
i
hold
the
instrument
steady
nor
perform
a
simple
calculation
he
rallied
a
little
in
crossing
a
mountain
range
as
they
drew
near
loanda
the
hearts
of
his
men
began
to
fail
and
they
hinted
their
doubts
to
him
if
you
suspect
me
you
can
return
he
told
them
for
i
am
as
ignorant
of
loanda
as
you
but
nothing
will
happen
to
you
but
what
happens
to
me
we
have
stood
by
one
another
hitherto
and
will
do
so
till
the
last
the
first
view
of
the
sea
staggered
the
makololo
we
were
marching
along
with
our
father
they
said
believing
what
the
ancients
had
told
us
that
the
world
had
no
end
but
all
at
once
the
world
said
to
us
am
finished
there
is
no
more
for
me
the
fever
had
produced
chronic
dysentery
which
was
so
depressing
that
livingstone
entered
loanda
in
deep
melancholy
doubting
the
reception
he
might
get
from
the
one
english
gentleman
gabriel
the
commissioner
for
the
suppression
of
the
he
was
soon
undeceived
gabriel
received
him
most
kindly
and
seeing
the
condition
he
was
in
gave
up
to
him
his
own
bed
never
shall
i
forget
the
luxurious
pleasure
i
enjoyed
in
feeling
myself
again
on
a
good
english
bed
after
six
months
sleeping
on
the
ground
i
was
soon
asleep
and
gabriel
coming
in
almost
immediately
after
rejoiced
in
the
soundness
of
my
repose
the
coup
of
louis
napoleon
alexis
de
tocqueville
by
his
astounding
act
of
december
known
as
the
charles
louis
napoleon
bonaparte
commonly
called
louis
napoleon
practically
assumed
imperial
power
and
on
the
first
anniversary
of
that
he
was
officially
proclaimed
emperor
of
the
french
under
the
title
of
napoleon
iii
he
was
the
son
of
louis
bonaparte
king
of
holland
a
brother
of
napoleon
i
and
was
born
in
paris
april
from
to
he
lived
in
exile
in
he
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
organize
a
revolution
among
the
french
soldiers
at
strasburg
four
years
later
he
tried
to
seize
the
throne
of
france
but
failing
in
this
attempt
he
was
imprisoned
in
the
fortress
of
ham
until
when
he
escaped
to
england
during
his
confinement
he
continued
in
his
writings
a
bonapartist
propaganda
he
had
addressed
himself
particularly
to
the
workingmen
and
this
class
won
a
victory
in
the
revolution
of
february
after
the
fall
of
louis
philippe
in
that
year
napoleon
was
elected
to
the
national
assembly
largely
by
the
votes
of
the
working
classes
and
on
june
took
his
seat
in
december
he
was
elected
president
of
the
republic
by
an
immense
majority
although
he
was
regarded
as
possessing
a
rather
dull
intellect
and
as
being
partly
for
that
reason
a
safe
man
for
the
presidential
office
napoleon
soon
proved
his
capacity
for
intrigue
and
for
cajoling
the
people
by
intervening
in
behalf
of
pope
pius
ix
whom
revolutionists
had
driven
from
rome
he
gained
the
support
of
the
clergy
troops
restored
pius
ix
to
the
papal
throne
the
president
aims
at
supremacy
were
approved
by
the
french
monarchists
and
he
used
all
means
to
increase
his
popularity
placing
only
his
adherents
in
office
when
the
assembly
composed
of
seven
hundred
sixty
members
undertook
to
restrict
the
suffrage
which
was
universal
napoleon
opposed
the
change
he
thus
appeared
to
be
the
champion
of
the
people
against
the
legislative
body
as
his
term
was
to
expire
on
may
and
as
he
was
ineligible
for
a
second
term
although
he
knew
that
a
majority
of
the
people
favored
his
continuance
in
office
he
saw
no
way
to
accomplish
that
except
by
force
he
therefore
determined
to
use
force
and
the
method
he
adopted
was
that
of
the
the
success
of
that
stroke
insured
all
that
he
aimed
at
in
december
by
an
almost
unanimous
vote
he
was
elected
president
for
ten
years
all
his
ideas
and
purposes
were
embodied
in
a
new
constitution
and
before
the
end
of
the
question
of
restoring
the
empire
was
submitted
to
the
people
and
by
the
plebiscite
of
november
in
that
year
an
enormous
majority
of
the
voters
elected
him
emperor
no
account
of
the
the
most
striking
and
effective
in
this
series
of
dramatic
events
surpasses
in
authenticity
or
interest
that
of
de
tocqueville
the
famous
author
of
in
and
of
equally
celebrated
works
of
french
history
became
of
the
national
assembly
in
as
a
member
of
that
body
he
was
justified
in
saying
of
his
story
of
the
i
merely
relate
as
an
actual
witness
the
things
i
saw
with
my
eyes
and
heard
with
my
ears
the
first
step
taken
by
napoleon
in
this
affair
was
the
arrest
of
the
opposition
leaders
of
the
assembly
in
their
beds
on
the
pretext
of
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
that
body
de
tocqueville
describes
what
followed
when
the
representatives
of
the
people
learned
on
the
morning
of
december
that
several
of
their
colleagues
were
arrested
they
ran
to
the
assembly
the
doors
were
guarded
by
the
chasseurs
de
vincennes
a
corps
of
troops
recently
returned
from
africa
and
long
accustomed
to
the
violence
of
algerine
dominion
and
moreover
stimulated
by
a
donation
of
five
francs
distributed
to
every
soldier
who
was
in
paris
that
day
the
representatives
nevertheless
presented
themselves
to
go
in
having
at
their
head
one
of
their
daru
this
gentleman
was
violently
struck
by
the
soldiers
and
the
representatives
who
accompanied
him
were
driven
back
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
three
of
them
de
talhouet
étienne
and
duparc
were
slightly
wounded
several
others
had
their
clothes
pierced
such
was
the
beginning
driven
from
the
doors
of
the
assembly
the
deputies
retired
to
the
of
the
tenth
arrondissement
they
were
already
assembled
to
the
number
of
about
three
hundred
when
the
troops
arrived
blocked
up
the
approaches
and
prevented
a
greater
number
of
representatives
from
entering
the
apartment
though
no
one
at
that
time
was
prevented
from
leaving
it
who
then
were
those
representatives
assembled
at
the
of
the
tenth
arrondissement
and
what
did
they
do
there
every
shade
of
opinion
was
represented
in
this
extemporaneous
assembly
but
of
its
members
belonged
to
the
different
conservative
parties
which
had
constituted
the
majority
this
assembly
was
presided
over
by
two
of
its
vitet
and
benoist
daru
was
arrested
in
his
own
house
the
fourth
the
illustrious
general
bedeau
had
been
seized
that
morning
in
his
bed
and
handcuffed
like
a
robber
as
for
the
president
dupin
he
was
absent
which
surprised
no
one
besides
its
the
assembly
was
accompanied
by
its
secretaries
its
ushers
and
even
its
phonographer
who
preserved
for
posterity
the
records
of
this
last
and
memorable
sitting
the
assembly
thus
constituted
began
by
voting
a
decree
in
the
following
terms
in
pursuance
of
article
of
the
constitution
the
president
of
the
republic
the
ministers
the
agents
and
depositaries
of
public
authority
are
responsible
each
in
what
concerns
himself
respectively
for
all
the
acts
of
the
government
and
the
administration
any
measure
by
which
the
president
of
the
republic
dissolves
the
national
assembly
prorogues
it
or
places
obstacles
in
the
exercise
of
its
powers
is
a
crime
of
high
treason
by
this
act
alone
the
president
is
deprived
of
all
authority
the
citizens
are
bound
to
withhold
their
obedience
the
executive
power
passes
in
full
right
to
the
national
assembly
the
judges
of
the
high
court
of
justice
will
meet
immediately
under
pain
of
forfeiture
they
will
convoke
the
juries
in
the
place
which
they
will
select
to
proceed
to
the
judgment
of
the
president
and
his
accomplices
they
will
nominate
the
magistrates
charged
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
public
ministers
and
seeing
that
the
national
assembly
is
prevented
by
violence
from
exercising
its
powers
it
decrees
as
follows
viz
louis
napoleon
bonaparte
is
deprived
of
all
authority
as
president
of
the
republic
the
citizens
are
enjoined
to
withhold
their
obedience
the
executive
power
has
passed
in
full
right
to
the
national
assembly
the
judges
of
the
high
court
of
justice
are
enjoined
to
meet
immediately
under
pain
of
forfeiture
to
proceed
to
the
judgment
of
the
president
and
his
accomplices
consequently
all
the
officers
and
functionaries
of
power
and
of
public
authority
are
bound
to
obey
all
requisitions
made
in
the
name
of
the
national
assembly
under
pain
of
forfeiture
and
of
high
treason
done
and
decreed
unanimously
in
public
sitting
this
second
day
of
december
after
this
first
decree
was
voted
another
was
unanimously
passed
naming
general
oudinot
commander
of
the
public
forces
and
tamisier
was
joined
with
him
as
chief
of
the
staff
the
choice
of
these
two
officers
each
having
distinct
shades
of
political
opinion
showed
that
the
assembly
was
animated
by
one
common
spirit
these
decrees
had
hardly
been
signed
by
all
the
members
present
and
deposited
in
a
place
of
safety
when
a
band
of
soldiers
headed
by
their
officers
sword
in
hand
appeared
at
the
door
without
however
daring
to
enter
the
apartment
the
assembly
awaited
them
in
perfect
silence
the
president
alone
raised
his
voice
read
the
decrees
which
had
just

passed
to
the
soldiers
and
ordered
them
to
retire
the
poor
fellows
ashamed
of
the
part
they
were
compelled
to
play
hesitated
the
officers
pale
and
undecided
declared
that
they
should
go
for
further
orders
they
retired
contenting
themselves
with
blockading
the
passages
leading
to
the
apartment
the
assembly
not
being
able
to
go
out
ordered
the
windows
to
be
opened
and
caused
the
decrees
to
be
read
to
the
people
and
the
troops
in
the
street
below
especially
that
decree
which
in
pursuance
of
the
article
of
the
constitution
declared
the
deposition
and
impeachment
of
louis
napoleon
soon
however
the
soldiers
reappeared
at
the
door
preceded
this
time
by
two
de
these
men
entered
the
room
and
amid
the
unbroken
silence
and
total
immobility
of
the
assembly
summoned
the
representatives
to
disperse
the
president
ordered
them
to
retire
themselves
one
of
the
was
agitated
and
faltered
the
other
broke
out
in
invectives
the
president
said
to
him
sir
we
are
here
the
lawful
authority
and
sole
representatives
of
law
and
of
right
we
know
that
we
can
not
oppose
to
you
material
force
but
we
will
leave
this
chamber
only
under
constraint
we
will
not
disperse
seize
us
and
convey
us
to
prison
all
all
exclaimed
the
members
of
the
assembly
after
much
hesitation
the
de
decided
to
act
they
caused
each
of
the
two
presidents
to
be
seized
by
the
collar
the
whole
body
then
rose
and
arm
in
arm
two
and
two
they
followed
the
presidents
who
were
led
off
in
this
order
they
reached
the
street
and
were
marched
across
the
city
without
knowing
whither
they
were
going
care
had
been
taken
to
circulate
a
report
among
the
crowd
and
the
troops
that
a
meeting
of
socialist
and
red
republican
deputies
had
been
arrested
but
when
the
people
beheld
among
those
who
were
thus
dragged
through
the
mud
of
paris
on
foot
like
a
gang
of
malefactors

the
most
illustrious
by
their
talents
and
their
virtues
generals
admirals
great
orators
great
writers
surrounded
by
the
bayonets
of
the
line
a
shout
was
raised
nationale
the
representatives
were
attended
by
these
shouts
until
they
reached
the
barracks
of
the
quai
where
they
were
shut
up
night
was
coming
on
and
it
was
wet
and
cold
yet
the
assembly
was
left
two
hours
in
the
open
air
as
if
the
government
did
not
deign
to
remember
its
existence
the
representatives
here
made
their
last
in
presence
of
their
phonographer
who
had
followed
them
the
number
present
was
two
hundred
eighteen
to
whom
were
added
about
twenty
more
in
the
course
of
the
evening
consisting
of
members
who
had
voluntarily
caused
themselves
to
be
arrested
almost
all
the
men
known
to
france
and
to
europe
who
formed
the
majority
of
the
legislative
assembly
were
gathered
in
this
place
few
were
wanting
except
those
who
like

had
not
been
suffered
to
reach

there
were
present
among
others
the

had
come

ill

had
struggled
for
three
years
to
defend

and
to
resist
the
demagogic
faction
when
two
hours
had
elapsed
this
assemblage
was
driven
into
upstairs
where
most
of
them
spent
the
night
without
fire
and
almost
without
food
stretched
upon
the
boards
it
only
remained
to
carry
off
to
prison
these
honorable
men
guilty
of
no
crime
but
the
defence
of
the
laws
of
their
country
for
this
purpose
the
most
distressing
and
ignominious
means
were
selected
the
cellular
vans
in
which
convicts
are
conveyed
to
prison
were
brought
up
in
these
vehicles
were
shut
up
the
men
who
had
served
and
honored
their
country
and
they
were
conveyed
like

criminals
some
to

of

some
to
the

mazas
in

and
the
remainder

the
indignation
of
the
public
compelled
the
government
two
days
afterward
to
release
the
greater
number
of
them
some
remained
in
confinement
unable
to
obtain
either
their
liberty
or
a
trial
the
treatment
inflicted
upon
the
generals
arrested
in
the
morning
of
december
was
still
more
disgraceful
cavaignac
lamoricière
bedeau
changarnier
the
conquerors
of

were
shut
up
in
these
infamous
cellular
vans
which
are
always
inconvenient
and
become
almost
intolerable
on
a
lengthened
journey
in
this
manner
they
were
conveyed
to
ham
that
is
they
were
made
to
perform
more
than
a

cavaignac

shut
up

day
and

night

cell
of
a
felon
i
leave
it
to
every
honest
man
and
every
generous
heart
to
comment
on
such
facts
such
were
the
indignities
offered
to
eminent
men
let
me
now
review
the
series
of
general
crimes
the
liberty
of
the
press
is
destroyed
to
an
extent
unheard
of
even
in
the
time
of
the
empire
most
of
the
journals
are
suppressed
those
which
appear
can
not
say
a
word
on
politics
or
even
publish
any
news
but
this
is
by
no
means
all
the
government
has
stuck
up
a
list
of
persons
who
are
formed
into
a
consultative
commission
its
object
is
to
induce
france
to
believe
that
the
executive
is
not
abandoned
by
every
man
of
respectability
and
consideration
among
us
more
than
half
the
persons
on
this
list
have
refused
to
belong
to
the
commission
most
of
them
regard
the
insertion
of
their
names
as
dishonor
i
may
quote
among
others
léon
faucher
portalis
first
president
of
the
court
of
cassation
and
the
duc
de
albuféra
as
those
best
known
not
only
does
the
government
decline
to
publish
the
letters
in
which
these
gentlemen
refuse
their
consent
but
even
their
names
are
not
withdrawn
from
the
list
which
dishonors
them
the
names
are
still
retained
in
spite
of
their
repeated
remonstrances
a
day
or
two
ago
one
of
them
joseph
perier
driven
to
desperation
by
this
excess
of
tyranny
rushed
into
the
street
to
strike
out
his
own
name
with
his
own
hands
from
the
public
placards
taking
the
to
witness
that
it
had
been
placed
there
by
a
lie
such
is
the
state
of
the
public
journals
let
us
now
see
the
condition
of
personal
liberty
i
say
again
that
personal
liberty
is
more
trampled
on
than
ever
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
empire
a
decree
of
the
new
power
gives
the
the
right
to
arrest
in
their
respective
departments
whomsoever
they
please
and
the
in
their
turn
send
blank
warrants
of
arrest
which
are
literally
de
to
the
under
their
orders
the
provisional
government
of
the
republic
never
went
so
far
human
life
is
as
little
respected
as
human
liberty
i
know
that
war
has
its
dreadful
necessities
but
the
disturbances
which
have
recently
occurred
in
paris
have
been
put
down
with
a
barbarity
unprecedented
in
our
civil
contests
and
when
we
remember
that
this
torrent
of
blood
has
been
shed
to
consummate
the
violation
of
all
law
we
can
not
but
think
that
sooner
or
later
it
will
fall
back
upon
the
heads
of
those
who
shed
it
as
for
the
appeal
of
the
people
to
whom
louis
napoleon
affects
to
submit
his
claims
never
was
a
more
odious
mockery
offered
to
a
nation
the
people
is
called
upon
to
express
its
opinion
yet
not
only
is
public
discussion
suppressed
but
even
the
knowledge
of
facts
the
people
is
asked
its
opinion
but
the
first
measure
taken
to
obtain
it
is
to
establish
military
terrorism
throughout
the
country
and
to
threaten
with
deprivation
every
public
agent
that
does
not
approve
in
writing
what
has
been
done
such
is
the
condition
in
which
we
stand
force
overturning
law
trampling
on
the
liberty
of
the
press
and
of
the
person
deriding
the
popular
will
in
whose
name
the
government
pretends
to
act
france
torn
from
the
alliance
of
free
nations
to
be
classed
with
the
despotic
monarchies
of
the
continent
such
is
the
result
of
this
the
army
refused
to
submit
to
the
decree
of
the
captive
assembly
impeaching
the
president
of
the
republic
but
the
high

edward

edward
jenks
it
was
a
remarkable
sequence
in
successful
enterprise
that
brought
to
light
and
developed
the
vast
gold
deposits
in
australia
within
three
years
after
the
great
discovery
in
california
this
event
was
to
change
if
not
the
entire
character
at
least
the
rate
of
australian
progress
the
date
of
captain
james
cook
exploration
of
the
eastern
coast
marks
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
australia
cook
took
possession
of
the
country
for
great
britain
from
the
resemblance
of
its
coasts
to
the
southern
shores
of
wales
he
called
it
new
south
wales
and
this
name
is
still
retained
by
one
of
the
states
of
the
commonwealth
of
australia
inaugurated
january
the
first
english
settlement
was
a
convict
colony
at
port
jackson
sydney
from
the
establishment
of
this
colony
the
development
of
australia
as
a
british
possession
was
gradual
but
progressive
up
to
the
discovery
of
the
by
which
it
was
so
greatly
accelerated
at
first
a
few
pastoral
groups
occupied
the
lands
near
the
coast
many
of
the
newcomers
were
mere
squatters
bent
on
making
money
and
then
returning
to
england
but
gradually
small
towns
and
settled
industries
grew
up
increasing
numbers
of
farmers
immigrated
squatters
were
pushed
toward
the
interior
and
a
state
of
social
organization
began
up
to
however
this
nucleus
of
a
new
commonwealth
had
reached
no
great
development
as
in
the
case
of
california
long
before
the
great
discovery
of
gold
in
australia
there
had
been
rumors
of
its
existence
in
that
country
most
of
the
early
stories
told
by
persons
said
to
have
found
specimens
of
the
metal
were
scouted
in
the
distinguished
geologist
sir
roderick
impey
murchison
having
compared
specimens
of
australian
rocks
brought
to
him
with
other
specimens
from
lands
declared
that
he
found
in
the
former
no
trace
of
gold
two
years
later
however
sir
roderick
declared
his
belief
in
the
existence
of
gold
in
australia
and
in
he
announced
that
he
had
seen
specimens
of
gold
from
new
south
wales
and
recommended
a
government
mineral
survey
there
little
attention
might
have
been
given
to
the
matter
then
but
for
the
discovery
of
gold
in
california
from
the
excitement
caused
by
that
the
gold
fever
spread
over
the
world
nothing
was
done
in
the
way
of
discovery
of
the
metal
in
australia
until
many
months
had
elapsed
but
finally
results
of
the
utmost
importance
were
obtained
the
story
of
the
great
australian
gold
discovery
is
here
told
in
an
authentic
and
highly
interesting
manner
by
the
historian
of
the
australasian
colonies
in
the
year
edmund
hammond
hargraves
an
old
settler
in
new
south
wales
returned
thither
from
california
where
he
had
spent
about
eighteen
months
in
the
search
for
gold
his
efforts
in
california
resulted
in
no
immediate
prosperity
but
he
gained
much
useful
practical
experience
more
than
this
as
he
looked
at
the
natural
features
of
the
california
a
great
idea
grew
up
in
his
mind
though
not
a
geologist
he
appears
to
have
had
a
quick
eye
for
stratiform
resemblances
and
the
more
he
studied
the
peculiarities
of
rocks
and
soil
in
california
the
more
he
became
convinced
that
he
knew
in
his
own
colony
a
district
which
presented
the
same
features
and
which
therefore
might
be
expected
to
produce
the
same
results
remaining
in
california
only
long
enough
to
verify
his
observations
he
returned
to
sydney
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
seldom
has
such
absolute
confidence
in
unverified
observation
proved
so
completely
justified
according
to
hargraves
own
account
he
went
without
hesitation
to
a
spot
on
the
banks
of
a
little
stream
known
as
lewes
pond
creek
a
tributary
of
summer
hill
creek
itself
a
tributary
of
the
macquarie
river
and
there
at
once
on
february
found
alluvial
gold
in
april
he
had
so
far
advanced
as
to
be
able
to
write
to
the
government
offering
to
disclose
his
treasures
for
five
hundred
pounds
but
he
subsequently
decided
to
trust
to
the
liberality
of
the
government
and
offered
at
once
to
show
his
workings
to
the
government
geologist
an
official
recently
sent
out
from
england
to
report
upon
gold
prospects
on
may
stutchbury
officially
reported
the
discovery
of
gold
in
workable
quantities
at
summer
hill
creek
and
by
the
end
of
the
same
month
the
immigration
to
the
diggings
had
begun
hargraves
himself
took
no
part
in
the
digging
merely
pointing
out
to
others
without
reserve
the
places
in
which
his
experience
led
him
to
predict
discovery
and
instructing
them
in
the
processes
of
washing
and
cleaning
he
was
soon
made
a
commissioner
of
crown
lands
and
received
a
reward
of
ten
thousand
pounds
now
began
a
period
which
can
have
no
complete
parallel
in
earlier
history
save
the
almost
contemporaneous
parallel
of
california
for
in
days
when
news
travelled
slowly
and
travelling
for
ordinary
men
was
still
slower
in
days
when
governments
jealously
prohibited
the
expatriation
of
their
subjects
and
only
allowed
the
immigration
of
aliens
under
strict
limitations
nothing
like
the
australian
could
have
taken
place
as
it
was
everything
favored
the
stampede
the
australian
colonies
themselves
were
anxious
for
immigrants
the
european
disturbances
of
had
led
many
continental
rulers
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
wiser
to
allow
turbulent
spirits
to
go
than
to
attempt
to
keep
them
the
new
era
of
industry
had
completely
unsettled
the
old
relationships
and
awakened
a
spirit
of
restlessness
finally
the
recent
application
of
steam
to
ships
had
rendered
a
rapid
decrease
in
the
length
of
the
voyage
from
europe
a
practical
certainty
from
the
moment
that
the
genuineness
of
hargraves
discoveries
was
placed
beyond
doubt
a
swarm
of
pilgrims
from
all
parts
of
the
world
set
their
faces
toward
the
diggings
many
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
arrivals
were
totally
unsuited
for
the
actual
work
of
mining
some
of
these
turned
to
other
pursuits
in
the
neighborhood
and
in
no
small
number
of
cases
did
far
better
than
the
diggers
whose
gold
they
received
but
thousands
turned
back
in
despair
after
a
few
days
experience
of
the
hardships
of
the
life
so
that
almost
from
the
first
there
was
an
enormous
traffic
to
and
fro
and
strong
division
of
parties
upon
the
gold
question
an
extreme
view
of
the
effect
upon
population
may
be
obtained
from
a
comparison
of
the
statistics
of
victoria
at
the
close
of
the
years
and
respectively
at
the
former
date
the
population
was
under
seventy
thousand
at
the
latter
it
was
upward
of
three
hundred
thousand
but
no
other
colony
increased
to
anything
like
this
extent
during
the
gold
rush
the
first
care
of
the
government
at
sydney
on
receiving
the
official
report
of
the
existence
of
gold
was
to
decide
upon
the
attitude
to
be
assumed
toward
the
diggers
it
was
abundantly
clear
that
the
establishment
of
mining
industries
would
mean
a
great
increase
of
expense
to
the
government
it
was
equally
clear
that
as
the
law
had
been
declared
over
and
over
again
in
the
colony
unauthorized
digging
on
crown
land
constituted
a
trespass
for
which
the
digger
was
legally
responsible
but
the
governor
was
wise
enough
to
see
that
no
threats
of
prosecution
would
deter
men
bent
on
digging
in
unoccupied
lands
even
if
it
were
possible
to
preserve
the
lands
of
private
owners
from
forcible
intrusion
the
squatting
question
had
demonstrated
that
beyond
a
certain
point
the
theory
of
crown
occupation
of
waste
lands
was
liable
to
break
down
so
the
government
advisers
suggested
a
compromise
falling
back
on
a
still
older
feudal
doctrine
they
asserted
the
indefeasible
right
of
the
crown
to
all
gold
found
either
on
private
or
public
lands
but
recommended
that
licenses
to
dig
should
be
granted
on
easy
terms
which
would
have
the
double
effect
of
providing
a
revenue
and
of
preserving
an
acknowledgment
of
the
crown
title
acting
on
this
advice
governor
fitzroy
on
may
issued
a
proclamation
forbidding
all
persons
to
dig
for
gold
on
any
lands
without
license
but
expressing
the
willingness
of
the
government
to
grant
licenses
at
a
fee
of
thirty
shillings
a
month
to
diggers
on
crown
lands
for
the
present
the
governor
refused
to
allow
digging
on
private
lands
without
the
owner
consent
the
proclamation
also
announced
that
no
license
would
be
given
to
any
laborer
or
servant
unless
he
could
produce
a
certificate
of
discharge
from
his
last
service
at
the
same
time
the
governor
established
the
practice
of
appointing
special
commissioners
for
the
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
licensing
system
and
the
general
maintenance
of
order
in
their
respective
districts
he
also
strengthened
the
police
force
by
every
means
in
his
power
and
then
awaited
developments
he
had
not
long
to
wait
almost
immediately
after
the
issue
of
the
proclamation
another
was
discovered
on
the
turon
river
also
a
feeder
of
the
macquarie
only
a
few
miles
from
lewes
pond
and
shortly
afterward
a
third
was
opened
up
on
the
abercrombie
a
tributary
of
the
murrumbidgee
which
takes
its
rise
in
the
cordillera
south
of
bathurst
by
the
beginning
of
june
gold
began
to
pour
into
bathurst
but
hardy
the
chief
commissioner
was
able
to
report
an
almost
idyllic
peace
and
plenty
at
the
diggings
in
the
middle
of
july
an
event
occurred
which
at
once
produced
a
violent
attack
of
gold
fever
this
was
the
discovery
of
an
enormous
mass
of
virgin
gold
weighing
upward
of
one
hundred
pounds
by
doctor
kerr
a
squatter
on
the
meroo
creek
doctor
kerr
had
been
guided
to
the
spot
by
an
aboriginal
who
had
been
in
his
service
several
years
and
in
his
excitement
he
broke
the
matrix
in
which
the
nugget
was
imbedded
and
thus
spoiled
what
would
have
been
the
most
magnificent
specimen
of
gold
quartz
hitherto
discovered
even
as
it
was
the
display
in
bathurst
of
a
single
find
of
gold
worth
four
thousand
pounds
was
enough
to
excite
the
feelings
of
the
inhabitants
to
a
pitch
inconsistent
with
steady
industry
but
doctor
kerr
find
raised
a
point
of
some
interest
to
the
government
in
framing
the
licensing
regulations
the
advisers
of
the
crown
had
thought
only
of
the
possibilities
of
alluvial
mining
had
they
even
directed
their
thoughts
toward
rock
gold
they
would
probably
have
considered
it
highly
improbable
that
any
explorer
should
be
able
to
extract
the
metal
without
an
amount
of
preparation
which
he
would
hardly
undertake
upon
the
security
of
a
bare
license
but
as
it
happened
doctor
kerr
had
not
even
a
license
when
he
discovered
the
gold
though
he
took
one
out
as
soon
as
possible
afterward
to
strengthen
its
position
the
government
seized
the
gold
in
the
hands
of
a
firm
of
shippers
who
were
about
to
send
it
to
england
but
on
the
representation
it
was
released
security
being
given
for
the
payment
of
a
royalty
of
per
cent
if
the
crown
should
see
fit
to
demand
it
early
in
august
the
governor
announced
that
for
the
future
licenses
would
be
held
to
cover
only
alluvial
gold
and
that
for
rock
gold
found
on
crown
land
the
government
would
demand
a
royalty
of
per
half
that
amount
if
the
working
was
on
private
land
a
fortnight
later
the
government
undertook
the
escort
of
gold
from
the
diggings
to
sydney
thereby
adding
considerably
to
the
crown
revenue
and
at
the
same
time
obtaining
additional
power
over
the
gold
districts
by
the
end
of
august
gold
to
the
value
of
seventy
thousand
pounds
had
been
exported
from
the
colony
but
these
figures
were
soon
eclipsed
by
those
which
followed
the
news
of
the
gold
discoveries
near
bathurst
had
soon
spread
through
the
australian
colonies
the
more
adventurous
of
the
colonists
started
at
once
for
the
diggings
others
often
encouraged
by
their
governments
who
foresaw
a
constant
drain
of
population
in
favor
of
the
gold
colony
endeavored
to
find
gold
within
their
own
limits
rumors
of
discoveries
were
constantly
arising
gold
was
found
at
echuca
in
south
australia
in
the
fingal
district
of
tasmania
and
in
the
curumandel
ranges
of
new
zealand
but
none
of
these
discoveries
could
compare
for
a
moment
with
those
which
took
place
within
the
newly
constituted
colony
of
victoria
even
so
early
as
august
gold
had
been
worked
at
a
place
called
deep
creek
or
anderson
creek
not
far
from
melbourne
but
this
was
soon
abandoned
in
favor
of
the
diggings
at
clunes
on
the
headwaters
of
the
streams
which
flow
north
from
the
great
dividing
range
to
the
murray
river
a
month
later
these
again
were
temporarily
deserted
in
favor
of
the
rich
buninyong
district
just
south
of
the
range
whose
chief
centre
was
ballarat
finally
at
the
beginning
of
october
the
wonderful
finds
at
mount
alexander
a
spur
of
the
macedon
range
to
the
north
of
melbourne
were
eclipsing
all
previous
discoveries
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
export
of
gold
from
victoria
alone
had
very
nearly
reached
half
a
million
in
value
in
two
years
the
population
of
the
victorian
almost
equalled
the
whole
population
of
the
colony
at
the
close
of
most
of
the
diggers
lived
in
tents
and
had
absolutely
no
interest
in
the
colony
beyond
the
mere
hope
of
profit
from
the
diggings
if
a
more
profitable
field
had
opened
elsewhere
they
would
have
left
at
once
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
probable
area
of
future
discoveries
was
pretty
well
recognized
the
with
few
exceptions
were
found
to
lie
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
eastern
cordillera
or
chain
of
mountains
which
beginning
with
mount
elliot
in
northern
queensland
follows
the
coast
with
remarkable
precision
till
it
reaches
port
phillip
bay
but
all
the
more
northerly
part
of
this
chain
was
unexplored
in
and
of
course
there
was
room
for
almost
any
development
within
such
wide
limits
warned
by
events
in
new
south
wales
the
governments
of
the
other
australian
colonies
had
made
preparations
for
the
crisis
western
australia
was
too
remote
to
be
much
affected
and
her
newly
arrived
supply
of
convict
labor
rendered
her
contented
but
south
australia
and
tasmania
suffered
severely
from
the
drain
of
population
which
set
in
toward
the
diggings
in
south
australia
the
effect
was
in
some
districts
almost
as
if
a
pestilence
had
swept
away
the
men
leaving
the
women
and
children
untouched
some
of
the
emigrants
really
deserted
their
families
but
the
bulk
were
honorable
men
and
remittances
of
gold
soon
began
to
find
their
way
to
adelaide
for
distribution
among
relatives
in
the
colony
after
the
comparative
failure
of
the
in
south
australia
the
government
had
wisely
set
itself
to
secure
some
part
of
the
prosperity
of
the
gold
discoveries
for
its
colony
by
establishing
both
land
and
river
traffic
routes
in
these
efforts
it
was
highly
successful
many
south
australians
made
handsome
fortunes
by
sending
provisions
to
the
buninyong
and
mount
alexander
districts
and
the
new
steamers
on
the
murray
proved
a
source
of
profit
to
the
colony
which
lasted
until
the
development
of
the
railroad
system
unfortunately
this
prosperity
could
hardly
be
realized
at
the
time
owing
to
the
great
scarcity
of
coined
money
in
the
colony
in
the
privilege
of
coining
was
still
jealously
monopolized
by
the
mint
in
london
while
the
rapid
expansion
of
business
in
the
latter
part
of
that
year
had
rendered
the
supply
of
coin
in
australia
totally
inadequate
to
the
demand
very
soon
after
the
discoveries
governor
fitzroy
had
sent
home
a
memorial
from
the
legislative
council
at
sydney
praying
for
the
establishment
of
a
branch
mint
in
that
city
and
similar
applications
soon
followed
from
the
other
colonies
on
march
a
treasury
minute
sanctioned
the
applications
and
colonial
mints
were
shortly
afterward
established
by
order
in
council
but
in
the
mean
while
the
south
australians
had
got
over
their
difficulty
by
passing
a
colonial
act
authorizing
the
issue
by
the
colonial
government
of
gold
ingots
of
slightly
higher
intrinsic
value
than
the
coins
they
were
supposed
to
represent
stamped
with
an
authentic
mark
these
ingots
were
not
made
legal
tender
and
the
only
object
of
the
government
mark
was
to
guarantee
quality
and
weight
but
they
were
generally
accepted
in
official
and
commercial
transactions
they
tided
over
the
crisis
of
scarcity
and
the
home
government
though
with
due
official
caution
approved
the
action
of
governor
young
in
tasmania
the
main
difficulty
arose
from
the
drain
of
emigrants
in
august
sir
william
denison
wrote
home
urging
the
transportation
of
more
convicts
or
probationers
on
the
ground
that
there
would
be
a
great
demand
for
foodstuffs
by
the
neighboring
colonies
while
the
supply
of
agricultural
laborers
would
be
shorter
than
ever
both
tasmania
and
south
australia
united
in
deciding
upon
the
continuance
of
the
system
by
which
free
emigrants
were
sent
out
at
the
expense
of
the
land
fund
of
each
colony
notwithstanding
that
such
emigrants
would
probably
leave
for
victoria
immediately
after
their
arrival
of
the
existence
of
this
contingency
there
could
be
little
doubt
on
january
the
governor
of
tasmania
wrote
i
have
a
number
of
men
who
have
come
back
from
mount
alexander
after
an
absence
from
this
colony
of
not
more
than
eight
weeks
with
gold
to
the
value
of
one
hundred
twenty
pounds
to
one
thousand
pounds
during
the
five
months
which
followed
the
writing
of
this
letter
four
thousand
persons
most
of
them
in
the
prime
of
life
left
tasmania
for
victoria
as
the
whole
population
of
tasmania
was
at
this
time
only
about
fifty
thousand
the
matter
was
serious
nevertheless
tasmania
tided
safely
over
the
difficulties
of
the
gold
period
and
even
was
able
to
help
her
sorely
tried
sister
for
it
was
upon
the
newly
established
government
at
melbourne
that
the
strain
of
the
new
era
most
severely
fell
the
government
at
sydney
was
an
old
and
tried
institution
with
traditions
of
more
than
half
a
century
and
a
staff
of
experienced
officials
under
an
exceptionally
able
chief
when
hargraves
made
his
discoveries
in
the
population
of
the
was
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
exclusive
of
the
port
phillip
district
and
such
a
population
meant
a
government
organization
of
corresponding
magnitude
moreover
the
people
of
new
south
wales
had
always
from
circumstances
been
accustomed
to
much
governmental
control
and
did
not
resent
it
while
victoria
had
been
started
as
a
colony
whose
people
were
too
prosperous
and
contented
to
require
more
than
a
minimum
of
guidance
when
the
gold
discoveries
suddenly
drew
into
the
colony
not
merely
the
most
turbulent
characters
of
australia
but
the
crews
of
deserted
ships
and
the
general
offscourings
of
the
civilized
world
and
when
overcome
by
the
contagion
the
government
officials
threw
up
their
posts
one
and
all
and
started
for
the
diggings
it
became
evident
that
the
had
his
hands
full
even
so
early
as
november
he
began
to
anticipate
trouble
from
the
preemptive
clauses
of
the
crown
lands
leasing
act
of
by
which
the
squatters
had
a
right
to
purchase
land
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
the
claims
of
the
squatters
barred
the
way
and
the
squatters
themselves
looked
with
small
favor
upon
a
class
of
men
whom
they
regarded
as
troublesome
intruders
and
whose
proceedings
rendered
it
almost
impossible
for
the
pastoralists
to
procure
sufficient
labor
to
carry
on
their
operations
the
squatters
chose
to
overlook
two
important
facts
that
they
had
themselves
originally
acquired
their
position
precisely
as
the
digger
acquired
his
and
that
the
presence
of
the
digger
if
it
raised
the
price
of
labor
also
enormously
increased
the
prices
of
the
squatter
produce
but
more
immediate
financial
troubles
began
to
press
upon
the
government
it
had
been
necessary
not
merely
to
add
largely
to
the
number
of
the
official
staff
to
provide
additional
police
commissioners
magistrates
customs
officers
but
also
to
increase
their
pay
in
some
proportion
to
the
greatly
increased
cost
of
living
even
with
an
increase
in
their
salaries
of
or
per
cent
the
subordinate
officials
would
not
stay
the
sight
of
the
reckless
and
prosperous
diggers
who
came
down
to
melbourne
to
spend
the
christmas
of
and
who
flung
their
gold
about
recklessly
was
too
much
for
the
feelings
of
the
civilians
they
deserted
in
troops
on
january
latrobe
wrote
the
police
in
town
and
country
have
almost
entirely
abandoned
duty
and
he
begged
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
send
military
aid
in
may
sir
john
pakington
replied
promising
six
companies
of
the
regiment
from
china
but
subsequently
decided
to
send
a
whole
regiment
direct
from
england
a
was
also
to
be
stationed
in
australian
waters
a
still
more
welcome
assistance
came
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
from
the
governor
of
tasmania
who
sent
at
latrobe
earnest
request
a
body
of
two
hundred
pensioners
who
had
been
serving
as
convict
guards
and
who
might
be
expected
to
resist
those
temptations
which
if
yielded
to
would
result
in
the
loss
of
their
pensions
but
all
this
assistance
meant
money
and
the
government
soon
fell
into
sore
straits
it
is
true
that
at
first
the
revenue
rose
substantially
comparing
the
income
for
the
quarters
ending
december
and
december
respectively
we
find
on
general
account
an
increase
of
eleven
thousand
pounds
or
about
per
and
on
the
territorial
account
or
land
fund
an
increase
of
thousand
pounds
about
per
cent
three
months
later
the
increase
was
about
per
cent
on
the
general
revenue
while
the
territorial
revenue
was
about
the
same
but
the
latter
fact
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
transferrence
of
the
fees
for
gold
licenses
to
the
general
revenue
it
is
more
important
however
to
notice
that
though
the
revenue
was

increasing
still

the

a
very
large
increase
of

but

for
public
buildings

and
other
necessaries

be

at

at
extravagantly
high

estimated
the
deficit
in
the
revenue
of
the
year
as
nearly
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
notwithstanding
that
he
reckoned
the
whole
gold
revenue
of
six
hundred
thousand
pounds
as
available
for
general
expenses
in
his
anxiety
the
had
at
first
december
proposed
to
double
the
license
fee
of
thirty
shillings
a
month
but
the
proposal
had
provoked
such
a
storm
of
opposition
that
he
withdrew
it
the
revenue
from
licenses
was
the
source
of
much
contention
the
government
alleged
that
it
was
not
taxation
but
rent
of
crown
lands
and
at
first
devoted
it
exclusively
to
the
service
of
the
the
diggers
denounced
it
as
taxation
without
representation
and
the
legislative
council
almost
necessarily
in
opposition
to
the
government
while
the
latter
was
administered
by
nominees
of
the
colonial
office
refused
to
make
up
deficiencies
out
of
the
general
revenue
thus
the
was
placed
between
two
fires
if
he
enforced
the
license
fees
he
angered
what
was
rapidly
becoming
the
largest
part
of
the
population
if
he
relinquished
them
he
left
himself
without
means
to
carry
on
the
government
of
the
from
this
dilemma
he
was
saved
by
the
receipt
of
a
general
permission
from
the
colonial
office
toward
the
close
of
to
deal
with
the
gold
revenue
in
the
same
manner
as
ordinary
revenue
by
placing
this
fund
at
the
disposal
of
the
colonial
legislature
the
home
government
not
only
removed
a
great
grievance
and
relieved
the
hands
of
the
from
the
shackles
previously
laid
upon
them
by
the
colonial
office
but
it
took
a
substantial
step
toward
the
end
that
was
now
acknowledged
on
all
sides
to
be
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
new
discoveries
the
introduction
of
responsible
government
the
same
despatch
contained
a
still
more
important
concession
authorizing
the
to
devote
the
remaining
part
of
the
land
revenue
that
arising
from
sales
and
pastoral
licenses
to
the
purposes
rendered
urgent
by
the
present
crisis
as
this
fund
was
jealously
reserved
by
the
existing
constitutions
of
the
australian
colonies
and
devoted
under
the
provisions
of
the
crown
land
sales
act
exclusively
to
the
purposes
of
emigration
and
public
works
it
will
be
seen
that
the
colonial
office
took
a
strong
step
in
sanctioning
its
diversion
but
it
must
be
observed
that
the
expenditure
of
this
additional
fund
was
placed
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
the
and
his
executive
council
acting
independently
of
the
colonial
legislature
with
this
assistance
the
struggled
on
amid
increasing
difficulties
till
the
spring
of
the
year
by
this
time
the
agitation
against
the
license
fee
had
reached
an
alarming
height
for
the
first
successes
of
the
new
discoveries
had
passed
away
and
although
the
export
of
gold
continued
to
increase
it
was
by
no
means
at
its
former
rate
nor
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
population
at
the
beginning
of
september
there
were
said
to
be
nearly
seventy
thousand
persons
living
at
the
victorian
and
many
of
these
in
all
probability
earned
very
little
more
than
mechanics
employed
in
settled
work
hence
there
was
a
fair
ground
for
an
orderly
agitation
against
the
amount
of
the
fee
but
unfortunately
the
diggers
preferred
violent
measures
there
was
some
excuse
for
them
they
were
not
represented
in
the
legislative
council
for
they
had
sprung
into
existence
as
a
body
since
the
passing
of
the
act
of
and
though
a
measure
had
been
introduced
with
a
view
to
giving
them
the
franchise
it
had
not
yet
received
the
assent
of
the
home
government
in
the
mean
time
therefore
they
could
not
through
their
representatives
in
the
council
effectively
criticise
either
the
existing
law
or
its
administration
with
regard
to
the
latter
there
was
obviously
room
for
complaint
for
the
immense
increase
of
business
had
compelled
the
government
to
appoint
an
inferior
class
of
officials
and
some
of
these
at
least
succumbed
to
the
strong
temptations
of
their
positions
at
the
beginning
of
august
a
petition
had
been
presented
by
the
bendigo
diggers
in
which
they
urged
the
reduction
of
the
license
fee
and
the
grant
of
representation
to
the
diggers
the
returned
a
pacific
reply
but
the
delegates
in
charge
of
the
petition
were
evidently
bent
on
arousing
strong
feelings
and
they
held
meetings
in
melbourne
which
went
the
extreme
length
permissible
to
loyal
subjects
still
the
shrank
from
strong
measures
and
endeavored
to
remove
one
ground
of
complaint
by
appointing
as
a
nominee
member
of
the
legislative
council
a
gentleman
who
was
believed
to
possess
the
confidence
of
the
diggers
the
nomination
was
at
once
repudiated
by
the
delegates
of
the
latter
and
at
the
end
of
august
an
organized
attempt
was
made
to
resist
the
renewal
of
licenses
on
the
old
terms
hundreds
of
diggers
pledged
themselves
to
pay
no
more
than
a
third
of
the
sum
previously
demanded
and
those
who
were
inclined
to
yield
to
the
government
demands
were
warned
that
the
agitators
would
not
be
responsible
for
their
safety
if
they
remained
at
the
diggings
the
license
system
had
by
this
time
extended
beyond
the
diggers
to
the
storekeepers
and
other
tradesmen
at
the
who
were
making
enormous
profits
out
of
the
diggers
and
these
for
the
most
part
unhesitatingly
complied
with
the
demands
of
the
agitators
willing
rather
to
pay
the
fines
for
breach
of
the
government
regulations
than
to
offend
their
customers
a
daring
attack
on
a
private
escort
of
gold
near
bendigo
which
occurred
about
this
time
showed
that
the
colony
was
on
the
verge
of
civil
war
just
at
this
moment
an
event
occurred
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
government
to
maintain
its
position
unimpaired
with
the
scanty
forces
at
its
disposal
in
the
middle
of
september
the
total
abolition
of
the
license
fee
was
seriously
proposed
in
the
legislative
council
of
new
south
wales
the
news
flew
like
wildfire
to
victoria
where
the
diggers
had
hitherto
looked
upon
the
colonial
legislatures
in
which
it
will
be
remembered
they
were
not
yet
represented
as
their
natural
enemies
it
seemed
to
them
now
that
they
had
everything
in
their
own
hands
and
it
became
clearly
impossible
for
the
government
in
the
existing
temper
of
the
diggers
to
exact
the
full
amount
of
the
license
fee
a
proclamation
hastily
published
with
a
view
to
allay
excitement
by
an
unfortunate
omission
in
the
printed
copies
led
the
public
to
believe
that
the
total
abolition
of
the
license
system
was
contemplated
by
the
victorian
government
a
select
committee
of
the
legislative
council
reported
unfavorably
upon
the
system
the
government
made
the
best
of
a
bad
bargain
and
accepted
a
fee
of
forty
shillings
for
the
three
months
ending
november
and
on
the
following
day
the
legislative
council
passed
a
new
act
which
greatly
reduced
the
fees
for
diggers
licenses
while
it
substantially
increased
those
demanded
for
permission
to
open
stores
at
the
it
also
provided
for
the
grant
of
leases
of
auriferous
lands
at
a
royalty
of
not
less
than
per
and
gave
legal
sanction
to
the
customs
regarding
the
claims
of
diggers
which
had
gradually
grown
up
to
regulate
the
rival
interests
of
neighboring
miners
offences
against
the
act
were
to
be
decided
upon
by
the
magistrates
but
the
accused
might
demand
a
court
of
at
least
two
members
and
there
was
to
be
an
appeal
to
general
sessions
these
measures
were
partly
successful
in
restoring
order
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
contained
men
who
were
averse
to
a
peaceable
settlement
notwithstanding
that
the
number
of
the
elective
members
of
the
legislative
council
was
more
than
once
increased
that
with
the
full
consent
of
the
home
government
a
bill
was
being
prepared
for
the
introduction
of
responsible
government
and
that
the
material
condition
of
the
diggers
was
being
rapidly
improved
the
had
in
january
to
report
the
formation
of
a
diggers
congress
which
obviously
had
for
its
object
the
supersession
of
the
ordinary
government
latrobe
retired
from
office
in
may
of
the
same
year
and
one
of
the
first
points
noticed
by
his
successor
sir
charles
hotham
was
the
existence
of
an
agitation
against
the
chinese
at
the
bendigo
diggings
notwithstanding
the
enthusiastic
character
of
his
reception
in
his
progress
through
the
in
september
the
new
governor
soon
had
to
face
serious
disturbances
the
events
of
the
next
few
months
formed
a
crisis
in
the
history
not
only
of
victoria
but
of
australia
naturally
there
is
much
dispute
concerning
them
and
as
the
following
account
is
taken
chiefly
from
sir
charles
hotham
reports
it
is
possible
that
the
acts
of
his
opponents
may
not
obtain
strict
justice
but
it
is
admitted
on
all
sides
that
sir
charles
acted
with
the
most
perfect
good
faith
and
the
accounts
given
by
the
insurgents
are
far
too
contradictory
and
prejudiced
to
receive
much
credit
on
the
night
of
october
a
miner
named
scobie
was
murdered
or
at
least
killed
at
the
eureka
hotel
near
ballarat
the
eureka
hotel
was
a
place
of
no
good
repute
kept
by
a
man
named
bentley
who
as
well
as
his
wife
was
it
is
said
an
from
tasmania
suspicion
fell
upon
the
couple
and
they
with
a
second
man
named
farrell
were
arrested
by
the
magistrates
but
almost
immediately
released
for
alleged
default
of
evidence
the
dismissal
of
the
charge
excited
a
storm
of
indignation
in
the
camp
and
a
body
of
diggers
at
once
proceeded
to
wreck
the
hotel
and
lynch
the
accused
in
the
latter
object
they
fortunately
did
not
succeed
and
so
rendered
themselves
liable
only
to
charges
of
riot
and
arson
instead
of
the
more
serious
charge
of
murder
four
of
the
ringleaders
were
through
the
prompt
measures
of
sir
charles
hotham
shortly
afterward
arrested
and
committed
for
trial
but
the
accusations
of
partiality
against
the
officials
were
too
strong
to
be
resisted
and
a
board
of
inquiry
hastily
instituted
by
the
governor
disclosed
the
ugly
facts
that
dewes
the
magistrate
who
presided
at
the
hearing
of
the
charge
against
the
bentleys
had
been
in
the
habit
of
borrowing
money
from
residents
and
that
milne
of
the
police
force
had
been
guilty
of
receiving
bribes
the
officials
implicated
were
at
once
dismissed
and
the
bentleys
and
farrell
rearrested
and
convicted
but
the
governor
very
properly
declined
to
release
the
arrested
rioters
who
shortly
before
christmas
were
convicted
and
sentenced
to
short
terms
of
imprisonment
meanwhile
more
disturbances
had
occurred
though
a
commission
upon
the
general
condition
of
the
was
holding
its
inquiries
in
november
many
diggers
again
refused
to
pay
the
reduced
license
fees
and
on
the
of
the
month
a
serious
riot
took
place
the
military
were
called
out
the
riot
act
was
read
and
there
was
some
shooting
eight
captures
were
made
but
the
lesson
had
not
been
severe
enough
and
a
state
of
open
war
ensued
the
diggers
intrenched
themselves
in
a
fortified
camp
known
as
the
eureka
stockade
openly
drilled
their
forces
in
the
presence
of
the
authorities
and
levied
horses
and
rations
from
unwilling
miners
in
the
name
of
a
at
the
same
time
they
issued
a
long
political
manifesto
which
while
it
did
not
avowedly
disclaim
allegiance
to
the
crown
contained
proposals
to
which
no
regularly
constituted
government
could
ever
have
assented
the
governor
at
once
ordered
all
the
available
military
force
to
ballarat
but
before
reinforcements
arrived
the
coolness
and
promptitude
of
captain
thomas
the
officer
in
command
of
the
troops
on
the
ballarat
when
the
riot
of
november
took
place
had
nipped
the
insurrection
in
the
bud
captain
thomas
saw
that
while
the
eureka
stockade
threatened
to
become
a
serious
obstacle
to
the
government
if
its
completion
were
allowed
in
its
uncompleted
state
it
was
really
a
source
of
weakness
to
the
insurgents
by
collecting
their
forces
in
one
spot
and
thus
rendering
them
more
exposed
to
a
crushing
attack
and
by
drawing
off
the
men
who
threatened
the
government
camp
it
really
left
the
commander
of
the
troops
free
to
act
with
decision
accordingly
captain
thomas
at
once
determined
to
attack
the
position
assembling
his
forces
somewhat
fewer
than
two
hundred
men
at
three
on
the
morning
of
december
he
moved
toward
the
stockade
at
about
one
hundred
fifty
yards
from
the
intrenchments
he
was
perceived
by
the
scouts
of
the
insurgents
who
promptly
fired
on
the
advancing
troops
thomas
himself
pasley
his
rede
the
resident
commissioner
and
racket
the
stipendiary
magistrate
all
of
whom
were
present
at
the
attack
positively
assert
that
the
insurgents
fired
before
a
shot
was
discharged
by
the
troops
upon
this
reception
captain
thomas
gave
the
order
to
fire
and
the
intrenchments
were
carried
with
a
rush
after
about
ten
minutes
of
sharp
fighting
captain
wise
was
fatally
wounded
and
three
privates
were
killed
outright
one
officer
and
eleven
privates
were
wounded
of
the
insurgents
about
thirty
were
known
to
have
been
killed
and
many
more
wounded
nearly
one
hundred
twenty
prisoners
were
taken
the
effect
of
the
victory
was
so
far
as
local
disturbances
were
concerned
instantaneous
even
before
the
reinforcements
under
general
nickle
appeared
all
resistance
to
the
authorities
had
died
away
and
though
the
governor
at
once
proclaimed
a
state
of
martial
law
he
was
able
to
recall
the
proclamation
in
less
than
a
week
in
other
districts
of
the
colony
the
effect
was
for
a
while
doubtful
the
extreme
reluctance
of
englishmen
to
admit
the
necessity
for
military
interference
by
the
government
told
strongly
in
favor
of
the
rioters
there
was
some
danger
that
melbourne
and
geelong
left
almost
entirely
unprotected
by
the
concentration
of
troops
and
police
at
ballarat
would
be
taken
possession
of
by
rioters
from
the
country
districts
and
sir
charles
hotham
made
hasty
application
to
sir
william
denison
the
governor
of
tasmania
for
military
assistance
very
soon
however
the
feelings
of
orderly
citizens
asserted
themselves
special
constables
were
sworn
in
at
melbourne
and
geelong
marines
from
two
stationed
at
port
phillip
guarded
the
prisons
and
the
powder
stores
wealthy
men
volunteered
to
serve
as
mounted
police
and
the
arrival
of
the
regiment
from
tasmania
on
december
dealt
a
final
blow
to
the
hopes
of
the
insurgents
even
before
this
event
all
the
respectable
classes
in
the
community
had
rallied
round
the
governor
and
he
felt
himself
in
a
position
to
defy
further
outbreaks
but
the
ugliest
feature
of
the
whole
affair
was
yet
to
be
revealed
out
of
the
large
number
of
prisoners
taken
at
the
capture
of
the
stockade
only
thirteen
were
committed
for
trial
the
magistrates
being
instructed
to
commit
only
when
the
evidence
was
of
the
clearest
nature
it
being
considered
impossible
to
obtain
an
impartial
trial
by
a
local
jury
the
prisoners
were
brought
down
to
melbourne
and
after
various
delays
the
charges
were
proceeded
with
on
february
a
boston
negro
named
john
joseph
and
a
reporter
for
the
ballarat
named
manning
were
first
tried
the
latter
may
have
been
merely
led
away
by
professional
ardor
in
the
pursuit
of
copy
though
the
fact
that
he
had
been
openly
drilled
and
instructed
in
the
use
of
a
pike
by
the
insurgents
would
seem
to
show
that
his
zeal
was
somewhat
excessive
in
the
case
of
joseph
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
he
had
actually
been
seen
to
fire
upon
the
troops
and
he
was
captured
in
a
tent
which
had
been
used
as
a
by
the
insurgents
no
was
offered
the
prisoners
counsel
relying
entirely
on
the
alleged
absence
of
treasonable
intention
nevertheless
both
prisoners
were
speedily
acquitted
and
although
the
government
wisely
withdrew
the
remaining
cases
for
the
time
subsequent
trials
produced
similar
results
ultimately
however
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
were
allayed
by
the
reforms
introduced
on
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
appointed
to
consider
the
whole
subject
of
the
this
body
presented
on
march
an
extremely
able
report
in
which
it
recommended
the
abolition
of
the
license
fee
and
the
substitution
therefor
of
a
right
or
crown
permission
lasting
for
a
year
and
granted
for
a
nominal
fee
of
one
pound
to
occupy
for
mining
purposes
a
specific
piece
of
crown
land
the
deficiency
in
revenue
anticipated
from
the
abolition
of
license
fees
was
to
be
met
by
the
imposition
of
an
export
duty
upon
gold
at
the
rate
of
a
an
ounce
the
commission
strongly
recommended
the
granting
of
the
political
franchise
to
holders
of
miners
rights
and
the
provision
of
liberal
facilities
for
the
acquisition
of
land
by
the
miners
it
also
advocated
the
simplification
of
the
existing
complex
system
of
government
in
the
mining
districts
whereby
commissioners
police
authorities
commissariat
officials
and
magistrates
all
worked
independently
of
each
other
and
suggested
the
substitution
therefor
of
experienced
wardens
at
the
head
of
elective
boards
who
should
not
only
dispose
with
the
aid
of
skilled
assessors
of
disputes
specially
connected
with
mining
operations
but
who
should
have
power
to
issue
adapted
to
the
special
requirements
of
each
district
these
recommendations
were
for
the
most
part
carried
out
by
legislation
of
the
same
year
and
before
his
lamented
death
in
december
sir
charles
hotham
had
the
happiness
being
able
to
report
to
the
home
government
the
almost
perfect
tranquillity
of
the
moreover
the
revenue
had
not
suffered
by
the
substitution
of
the
export
duty
for
the
license
fees
but
the
collector
of
customs
was
of
opinion
that
the
result
of
the
change
had
been
to
throw
the
entire
burden
of
the
tax
upon
the
importers
of
the
colony
instead
of
upon
the
mining
population
the
government
was
not
however
disposed
to
concern
itself
with
considerations
of
abstract
justice
so
long
as
it
could
collect
a
sufficient
revenue
without
serious
opposition
the
rise
of
the
republican
party
abraham
lincoln
the
election
of
virtually
destroyed
the
whig
party
and
franklin
pierce
the
candidate
of
the
democratic
party
was
elected
by
great
majorities
if
the
whig
party
had
perished
because
it
had
no
distinct
position
upon
the
one
overshadowing
question
of
the
day
so
neither
did
the
new
president
comprehend
the
nature
and
condition
of
that
issue
in
his
first
message
he
complacently
congratulated
the
country
that
the
slavery
question
had
been
settled
peacefully
and
forever
by
the
compromise
measures
of
he
little
knew
how
ineffective
were
those
compromises
he
never
dreamed
that
it
was
a
question
that
no
compromise
could
settle
permanently
and
probably
had
no
conception
of
the
new
force
that
was
to
be
given
to
it
during
his
own
term
of
office
stephen
douglas
an
acknowledged
aspirant
to
the
presidency
being
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
on
territories
introduced
and
carried
through
congress
a
measure
called
the
bill
which
in
providing
for
the
admission
of
those
territories
as
states
embodied
his
doctrine
of
popular
sovereignty
in
that
it
permitted
the
inhabitants
to
determine
by
popular
vote
whether
they
should
come
into
the
union
as
free
states
or
as
slave
states
and
abolished
the
missouri
compromise
which
for
years
had
forbidden
the
acquisition
of
any
slave
territory
north
of
the
parallel
of
the
abrogation
of
this
compromise
which
had
been
looked
upon
as
a
sacred
compact
convinced
a
majority
of
the
northern
people
that
the
system
of
slavery
was
filled
with
the
spirit
of
aggressiveness
and
determined
to
spread
itself
into
all
the
territories
consequently
there
arose
for
the
first
time
a
powerful
party
which
while
denying
that
it
had
any
purpose
of
meddling
with
that
institution
in
the
states
where
it
already
existed
declared
that
it
should
never
be
extended
into
any
more
of
the
national
domain
at
the
same
time
this
was
a
stronger
party
in
favor
of
the
protective
tariff
than
had
ever
before
existed
this
organization
which
gave
itself
the
name
republican
party
came
into
existence
in
the
same
year
in
which
senator
douglas
bill
abrogated
the
missouri
compromise
there
are
several
claimants
for
the
honor
of
first
proposing
it
but
as
a
fact
it
sprang
into
existence
with
virtual
simultaneousness
in
several
of
the
northern
states
if
there
was
a
priority
it
was
in
massachusetts
where
robert
carter
acted
as
secretary
of
the
convention
and
wrote
the
resolutions
two
years
later
this
party
entered
the
presidential
contest
with
john
frémont
as
its
candidate
it
cast
an
enormous
vote
but
was
not
successful
mainly
for
the
reason
that
the
american
or
party
was
then
at
its
best
and
had
its
own
ticket
headed
by
millard
fillmore
four
years
later
still
it
nominated
and
elected
abraham
lincoln
as
president
and
the
clearest
argument
for
its
existence
that
ever
has
been
put
forth
is
in
lincoln
first
speech
in
his
famous
debate
with
senator
douglas
which
was
delivered
in
springfield
illinois
june
the
full
text
of
that
speech
follows
herewith
if
we
could
first
know
where
we
are
and
whither
we
are
tending
we
could
better
judge
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
we
are
now
far
into
the
fifth
year
since
a
policy
was
initiated
with
the
avowed
object
and
confident
promise
of
putting
an
end
to
slavery
agitation
under
the
operation
of
that
policy
that
agitation
has
not
only
not
ceased
but
has
constantly
augmented
in
my
opinion
it
will
not
cease
until
a
crisis
shall
have
been
reached
and
passed
a
house
divided
against
itself
can
not
stand
i
believe
this
government
can
not
endure
permanently
half
slave
and
half
free
i
do
not
expect
the
union
to
be
dissolved
i
do
not
expect
the
house
to
fall
but
i
do
expect
it
will
cease
to
be
divided
it
will
become
all
one
thing
or
all
the
other
either
the
opponents
of
slavery
will
arrest
the
further
spread
of
it
and
place
it
where
the
public
mind
shall
rest
in
the
belief
that
it
is
in
the
course
of
ultimate
extinction
or
its
advocates
will
push
it
forward
till
it
shall
become
alike
lawful
in
all
the
states
old
as
well
as
new
north
as
well
as
south
have
we
no
tendency
to
the
latter
condition
let
anyone
who
doubts
carefully
contemplate
that
now
almost
complete
legal
combination
piece
of
machinery
so
to
speak
compounded
of
the
nebraska
doctrine
and
the
dred
scott
decision
let
him
consider
not
only
what
work
the
machinery
is
adapted
to
do
and
how
well
adapted
but
also
let
him
study
the
history
of
its
construction
and
trace
if
he
can
or
rather
fail
if
he
can
to
trace
the
evidences
of
design
and
concert
of
action
among
its
chief
architects
from
the
beginning
the
new
year
of
found
slavery
excluded
from
more
than
half
the
states
by
state
constitutions
and
from
most
of
the
national
territory
by
congressional
prohibition
four
days
later
commenced
the
struggle
which
ended
in
repealing
that
congressional
prohibition
this
opened
all
the
national
territory
to
slavery
and
was
the
first
point
gained
but
so
far
congress
only
had
acted
and
an
indorsement
by
the
people
real
or
apparent
was
indispensable
to
save
the
point
already
gained
and
give
chance
for
more
this
necessity
had
not
been
overlooked
but
had
been
provided
for
as
well
as
might
be
in
the
notable
argument
of
squatter
sovereignty
otherwise
called
sacred
right
of
which
latter
phrase
though
expressive
of
the
only
rightful
basis
of
any
government
was
so
perverted
in
this
attempted
use
of
it
as
to
amount
to
just
this
that
if
any
man
choose
to
enslave
no
man
shall
be
allowed
to
object
that
argument
was
incorporated
into
the
nebraska
bill
itself
in
the
language
which
follows
it
being
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
this
act
not
to
legislate
slavery
into
any
territory
or
state
nor
to
exclude
it
therefrom
but
to
leave
the
people
thereof
perfectly
free
to
form
and
regulate
their
domestic
institutions
in
their
own
way
subject
only
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
then
opened
the
roar
of
loose
declamation
in
favor
of
squatter
sovereignty
and
sacred
right
of
but
said
opposition
members
let
us
amend
the
bill
so
as
to
expressly
declare
that
the
people
of
the
territory
may
exclude
slavery
not
we
said
the
friends
of
the
measure
and
down
they
voted
the
amendment
while
the
nebraska
bill
was
passing
through
congress
a
case
involving
the
question
of
a
negro
freedom
by
reason
of
his
owner
having
voluntarily
taken
him
first
into
a
free
state
and
then
into
a
territory
covered
by
the
congressional
prohibition
and
held
him
as
a
slave
for
a
long
time
in
each
was
passing
through
the
united
states
circuit
court
for
the
district
of
missouri
and
both
nebraska
bill
and
lawsuit
were
brought
to
a
decision
in
the
same
month
of
may
the
negro
name
was
dred
scott
which
name
now
designates
the
decision
finally
made
in
the
case
before
the
then
next
presidential
election
the
law
case
came
to
and
was
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
but
the
decision
of
it
was
deferred
until
after
the
election
still
before
the
election
senator
trumbull
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
requested
the
leading
advocate
of
the
nebraska
bill
to
state
whether
the
people
of
a
territory
can
constitutionally
exclude
slavery
from
their
limits
and
the
latter
answers
that
is
a
question
for
the
supreme
court
the
election
came
buchanan
was
elected
and
the
indorsement
such
as
it
was
secured
that
was
the
second
point
gained
the
indorsement
however
fell
short
of
a
clear
popular
majority
by
nearly
four
hundred
thousand
votes
and
so
perhaps
was
not
overwhelmingly
reliable
and
satisfactory
the
outgoing
president
in
his
last
annual
message
as
impressively
as
possible
echoed
back
upon
the
people
the
weight
and
authority
of
the
indorsement
the
supreme
court
met
again
did
not
announce
their
decision
but
ordered
a
reargument
the
presidential
inauguration
came
and
still
no
decision
of
the
court
but
the
incoming
president
in
his
inaugural
address
fervently
exhorted
the
people
to
abide
by
the
forthcoming
decision
whatever
it
might
be
then
in
a
few
days
came
the
decision
the
reputed
author
of
the
nebraska
bill
finds
an
early
occasion
to
make
a
speech
at
this
capital
indorsing
the
dred
scott
decision
and
vehemently
denouncing
all
opposition
to
it
the
new
president
too
seizes
the
early
occasion
of
the
silliman
letter
to
indorse
and
strongly
construe
that
decision
and
to
express
his
astonishment
that
any
different
view
had
ever
been
entertained
at
length
a
squabble
springs
up
between
the
president
and
the
author
of
the
nebraska
bill
on
the
mere
question
of
whether
the
lecompton
constitution
was
or
was
not
in
any
just
sense
made
by
the
people
of
kansas
and
in
that
quarrel
the
latter
declares
that
all
he
wants
is
a
fair
vote
for
the
people
and
that
he
cares
not
whether
slavery
be
voted
or
voted
i
do
not
understand
his
declaration
that
he
cares
not
whether
slavery
be
voted
down
or
voted
up
to
be
intended
by
him
other
than
as
an
apt
definition
of
the
policy
he
would
impress
upon
the
public
mind
the
principle
for
which
he
declares
he
has
suffered
so
much
and
is
ready
to
suffer
to
the
end
and
well
may
he
cling
to
that
principle
if
he
has
any
parental
feeling
well
may
he
cling
to
it
that
principle
is
the
only
shred
left
of
his
original
nebraska
doctrine
under
the
dred
scott
decision
squatter
sovereignty
squatted
out
of
existence
tumbled
down
like
temporary
scaffolding
like
the
mould
at
the
foundry
served
through
one
blast
and
fell
back
into
loose
sand
helped
to
carry
an
election
and
then
was
kicked
to
the
winds
his
late
joint
struggle
with
the
republicans
against
the
lecompton
constitution
involves
nothing
of
the
original
nebraska
doctrine
that
struggle
was
made
on
a
point
the
right
of
a
people
to
make
their
own
constitution
upon
which
he
and
the
republicans
have
never
differed
the
several
points
of
the
dred
scott
decision
in
connection
with
senator
douglas
care
not
policy
constitute
the
piece
of
machinery
in
its
present
state
of
advancement
this
was
the
third
point
gained
the
points
of
that
machinery
are
firstly
that
no
negro
slave
imported
as
such
from
africa
and
no
descendant
of
such
slave
can
ever
be
a
citizen
of
any
state
in
the
sense
of
that
term
as
used
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
this
point
is
made
in
order
to
deprive
the
negro
in
every
possible
event
of
the
benefit
of
that
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
declares
that
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
in
the
several
states
secondly
that
subject
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
neither
congress
nor
a
territorial
legislature
can
exclude
slavery
from
any
united
states
territory
this
point
is
made
in
order
that
individual
men
may
fill
up
the
territories
with
slaves
without
danger
of
losing
them
as
property
and
thus
to
enhance
the
chances
of
permanency
to
the
institution
through
all
the
future
thirdly
that
whether
the
holding
a
negro
in
actual
slavery
in
a
free
state
makes
him
free
as
against
the
holder
the
united
states
courts
will
not
decide
but
will
leave
to
be
decided
by
the
courts
of
any
slave
state
the
negro
may
be
forced
into
by
the
master
this
point
is
made
not
to
be
pressed
immediately
but
if
acquiesced
in
for
a
while
and
apparently
indorsed
by
the
people
at
an
election
then
to
sustain
the
logical
conclusion
that
what
dred
scott
master
might
lawfully
do
with
dred
scott
in
the
free
state
of
illinois
every
other
master
may
lawfully
do
with
any
other
one
or
one
thousand
slaves
in
illinois
or
in
any
other
free
state
auxiliary
to
all
this
and
working
hand
in
hand
with
it
the
nebraska
doctrine
or
what
is
left
of
it
is
to
educate
and
mould
public
opinion
at
least
northern
public
opinion
not
to
care
whether
slavery
is
voted
down
or
voted
up
this
shows
exactly
where
we
now
are
and
partially
also
whither
we
are
tending
it
will
throw
additional
light
on
the
latter
to
go
back
and
run
the
mind
over
the
string
of
historical
facts
already
stated
several
things
will
now
appear
less
dark
and
mysterious
than
they
did
when
they
were
transpiring
the
people
were
to
be
left
perfectly
free
subject
only
to
the
constitution
what
the
constitution
had
to
do
with
it
outsiders
could
not
then
see
plainly
enough
now
it
was
an
exactly
fitted
niche
for
the
dred
scott
decision
to
come
in
afterward
and
declare
the
perfect
freedom
of
the
people
to
be
just
no
freedom
at
all
why
was
the
amendment
expressly
declaring
the
right
of
the
people
voted
down
plainly
enough
now
the
adoption
of
it
would
have
spoiled
the
niche
for
the
dred
scott
decision
why
was
the
court
decision
held
up
why
even
a
senator
individual
opinion
withheld
till
after
the
presidential
election
plainly
enough
now
the
speaking
out
then
would
have
damaged
the
perfectly
free
argument
upon
which
the
election
was
to
be
carried
why
the
outgoing
president
felicitation
on
the
indorsement
why
the
delay
of
a
reargument
why
the
incoming
president
advance
exhortation
in
favor
of
the
decision
these
things
look
like
the
cautious
patting
and
petting
of
a
spirited
horse
preparatory
to
mounting
him
when
it
is
dreaded
that
he
may
give
the
rider
a
fall
and
why
the
hasty
of
the
decision
by
the
president
and
others
we
can
not
absolutely
know
that
all
these
exact
adaptations
are
the
result
of
preconcert
but
when
we
see
a
lot
of
framed
timbers
different
portions
of
which
we
know
have
been
gotten
out
at
different
times
and
places
and
by
different
workmen
stephen
franklin
roger
and
james
for
instance
and
when
we
see
these
timbers
joined
together
and
see
they
exactly
make
the
frame
of
a
house
or
a
mill
all
the
tenons
and
mortises
exactly
fitting
and
all
the
lengths
and
proportions
of
the
different
pieces
exactly
adapted
to
their
respective
places
and
not
a
piece
too
many
or
too
few
not
omitting
even
scaffolding
or
if
a
single
piece
be
lacking
we
see
the
place
in
the
frame
exactly
fitted
and
prepared
yet
to
bring
such
piece
in
in
such
a
case
we
find
it
impossible
not
to
believe
that
stephen
and
franklin
and
roger
and
james
all
understood
one
another
from
the
beginning
and
all
worked
upon
a
common
plan
or
draft
drawn
up
before
the
first
blow
was
struck
it
should
not
be
overlooked
that
by
the
nebraska
bill
the
people
of
a
as
well
as
territory
were
to
be
left
perfectly
free
subject
only
to
the
constitution
why
mention
a
state
they
were
legislating
for
territories
and
not
for
or
about
states
certainly
the
people
of
a
state
are
and
ought
to
be
subject
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
why
is
mention
of
this
lugged
into
this
merely
territorial
law
why
are
the
people
of
a
territory
and
the
people
of
a
state
therein
lumped
together
and
their
relation
to
the
constitution
therein
treated
as
being
precisely
the
same
while
the
opinion
of
the
court
by
chief
justice
taney
in
the
dred
scott
case
and
the
separate
opinions
of
all
the
concurring
judges
expressly
declare
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
neither
permits
congress
nor
a
territorial
legislature
to
exclude
slavery
from
any
united
states
territory
they
all
omit
to
declare
whether
or
not
the
same
constitution
permits
a
state
or
the
people
of
a
state
to
exclude
it
this
is
a
mere
omission
but
who
can
be
quite
sure
if
mclean
or
curtis
had
sought
to
get
into
the
opinion
a
declaration
of
unlimited
power
in
the
people
of
a
state
to
exclude
slavery
from
their
limits
just
as
chase
and
mace
sought
to
get
such
declaration
in
behalf
of
the
people
of
a
territory
into
the
nebraska
bill
i
ask
who
can
be
quite
sure
that
it
would
not
have
been
voted
down
in
the
one
case
as
it
had
been
in
the
other
the
nearest
approach
to
the
point
of
declaring
the
power
of
a
state
over
slavery
is
made
by
judge
nelson
he
approaches
it
more
than
once
using
the
precise
idea
and
almost
the
language
too
of
the
nebraska
act
on
one
occasion
his
exact
language
is
except
in
cases
where
the
power
is
restrained
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
law
of
the
state
is
supreme
over
the
subject
of
slavery
within
its
jurisdiction
in
what
cases
the
power
of
the
states
is
so
restrained
by
the
united
states
constitution
is
left
an
open
question
precisely
as
the
same
question
as
to
the
restraint
on
the
power
of
the
territories
was
left
open
in
the
nebraska
act
put
this
and
that
together
and
we
have
another
nice
little
niche
which
we
may
ere
long
see
filled
with
another
supreme
court
decision
declaring
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
permit
a
to
exclude
slavery
from
its
limits
and
this
may
especially
be
expected
if
the
doctrine
of
care
not
whether
slavery
be
voted
down
or
voted
up
shall
gain
upon
the
public
mind
sufficiently
to
give
promise
that
such
a
decision
can
be
maintained
when
made
such
a
decision
is
all
that
slavery
now
lacks
of
being
alike
lawful
in
all
the
states
welcome
or
unwelcome
such
decision
is
probably
coming
and
will
soon
be
upon
us
unless
the
power
of
the
present
political
dynasty
shall
be
met
and
overthrown
we
shall
lie
down
pleasantly
dreaming
that
the
people
of
missouri
are
on
the
verge
of
making
their
state
free
and
we
shall
awake
to
the
reality
instead
that
the
supreme
court
has
made
illinois
a
slave
state
to
meet
and
overthrow
the
power
of
that
dynasty
is
the
work
now
before
all
who
would
prevent
that
consummation
that
is
what
we
have
to
do
how
can
we
best
do
it
there
are
those
who
denounce
us
openly
to
their
own
friends
and
yet
whisper
us
softly
that
senator
douglas
is
the
aptest
instrument
there
is
with
which
to
effect
that
object
they
wish
us
to
all
from
the
fact
that
he
now
has
a
little
quarrel
with
the
present
head
of
the
dynasty
and
that
he
has
regularly
voted
with
us
on
a
single
point
upon
which
he
and
we
have
never
differed
they
remind
us
that
he
is
a
great
man
and
that
the
largest
of
us
are
very
small
ones
let
this
be
granted
but
a
living
dog
is
better
than
a
dead
lion
judge
douglas
if
not
a
dead
lion
for
this
work
is
at
least
a
caged
and
toothless
one
how
can
he
oppose
the
advances
of
slavery
he
do
care
anything
about
it
his
avowed
mission
is
impressing
the
public
heart
to
nothing
about
a
leading
douglas
democratic
newspaper
thinks
superior
talent
will
be
needed
to
resist
the
revival
of
the
african
does
douglas
believe
an
effort
to
revive
that
trade
is
approaching
he
has
not
said
so
does
he
really
think
so
but
if
it
is
how
can
he
resist
it
for
years
he
has
labored
to
prove
it
a
sacred
right
of
white
men
to
take
negro
slaves
into
the
new
territories
can
he
possibly
show
that
it
is
less
a
sacred
right
to
buy
them
where
they
can
be
bought
cheapest
and
unquestionably
they
can
be
bought
cheaper
in
africa
than
in
virginia
he
has
done
all
in
his
power
to
reduce
the
whole
question
of
slavery
to
one
of
a
mere
right
of
property
and
as
such
how
can
he
oppose
the
foreign
how
can
he
refuse
that
trade
in
that
property
shall
be
perfectly
free
unless
he
does
it
as
a
protection
to
the
home
production
and
as
the
home
producers
will
probably
not
ask
the
protection
he
will
be
wholly
without
a
ground
of
opposition
senator
douglas
holds
we
know
that
a
man
may
rightfully
be
wiser
than
he
was
yesterday
that
he
may
rightfully
change
when
he
finds
himself
wrong
but
can
we
for
that
reason
run
ahead
and
infer
that
he
will
make
any
particular
change
of
which
he
himself
has
given
no
intimation
can
we
safely
base
our
action
upon
any
such
vague
inference
now
as
ever
i
wish
not
to
misrepresent
judge
position
question
his
motives
or
do
aught
that
can
be
personally
offensive
to
him
whenever
if
ever
he
and
we
can
come
together
on
principle
so
that
our
cause
may
have
assistance
from
his
great
ability
i
hope
to
have
interposed
no
adventitious
obstacle
but
clearly
he
is
not
now
with
us
he
does
not
pretend
to
be
he
does
not
promise
ever
to
be
our
cause
then
must
be
intrusted
to
and
conducted
by
its
own
undoubted
friends
those
whose
hands
are
free
whose
hearts
are
in
the
work
who
for
the
result
two
years
ago
the
republicans
of
the
nation
mustered
over
thirteen
hundred
thousand
strong
we
did
this
under
the
single
impulse
of
resistance
to
a
common
danger
with
every
external
circumstance
against
us
of
strange
discordant
and
even
hostile
elements
we
gathered
from
the
four
winds
and
formed
and
fought
the
battle
through
under
the
constant
hot
fire
of
a
disciplined
proud
and
pampered
enemy
did
we
brave
all
then
to
falter
now
when
that
same
enemy
is
wavering
dissevered
and
belligerent
the
result
is
not
doubtful
we
shall
not
fail
if
we
stand
firm
we
not
wise
counsels
may
accelerate
or
mistakes
delay
it
but
sooner
or
later
the
victory
is
sure
to
come
the
opening
of
japan
matthew
perry
in
view
of
the
events
that
have
followed
the
ending
of
and
the
opening
of
that
country
first
to
american
commerce
and
later
to
intercourse
must
now
be
regarded
as
an
achievement
of
momentous
consequence
far
exceeding
in
importance
all
that
even
the
most
prophetic
statesmanship
of
the
time
could
foresee
under
the
shoguns
or
military
chiefs
who
after
the
seventh
century
overshadowed
the
hereditary
rulers
the
mikados
there
grew
up
in
japan
a
feudal
system
whereby
the
generals
recognized
as
overlords
increased
and
perpetuated
their
power
the
attempts
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
to
introduce
christianity
were
met
with
resistance
and
persecution
and
ended
in
failure
in
the
same
centuries
japan
traded
with
the
portuguese
but
excluded
them
in
after
this
the
japanese
isolation
was
complete
except
for
restricted
trade
with
the
dutch
until
the
conclusion
of
commodore
perry
treaty
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
large
amount
of
american
capital
was
invested
in
the
whaling
industry
in
japanese
and
chinese
waters
and
one
motive
for
the
sending
of
perry
expedition
to
japan
was
the
protection
of
the
whalers
other
things
leading
to
that
step
were
the
discovery
of
gold
in
california
the
growth
of
industrial
and
commercial
centres
on
the
pacific
coast
of
the
united
states
increasing
trade
with
china
and
the
development
of
necessitating
and
ports
for
shelter
in
the
orient
at
the
same
time
progressive
minds
in
japan
were
advancing
in
knowledge
of
western
science
and
political
affairs
thus
the
east
and
the
west
were
almost
prepared
for
a
change
in
their
mutual
relations
in
the
united
states
government
empowered
commodore
john
aulick
to
negotiate
and
sign
commercial
treaties
with
japan
on
the
eve
of
his
intended
departure
he
was
prevented
from
sailing
and
in
the
following
year
commodore
matthew
perry
brother
of
oliver
hazard
perry
the
hero
of
lake
erie
succeeded
to
his
mission
he
was
invested
with
extraordinary
naval
and
diplomatic
powers
his
immediate
object
being
to
establish
a
in
japan
on
november
he
sailed
from
norfolk
with
the
mississippi
leaving
other
ships
to
follow
as
soon
as
ready
with
his
squadron
he
entered
the
bay
of
tokio
then
called
yedo
in
july
causing
great
commotion
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
japanese
capital
who
mistook
his
appearance
for
a
hostile
approach
it
required
both
firmness
and
tact
on
perry
part
to
open
friendly
communication
and
present
his
proposals
but
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
much
and
then
saying
that
in
the
following
spring
he
would
come
for
an
answer
he
withdrew
to
china
in
february
he
returned
to
tokio
with
a
fleet
of
eight
vessels
after
some
parley
the
japanese
authorities
agreed
to
a
conference
at
kanagawa
a
seaport
adjoining
yokohama
of
the
negotiations
that
followed
and
the
treaty
in
which
they
resulted
the
following
pages
tell
and
commodore
perry
own
account
is
the
best
record
of
his
distinguished
service
not
only
to
his
own
country
and
japan
but
likewise
to
the
civilized
world
after
concessions
made
by
the
japanese
the
greatest
good
feeling
prevailed
on
both
sides
and
there
seemed
every
prospect
of
establishing
those
national
relations
which
had
been
the
purpose
of
commodore
mission
in
accordance
with
the
harmony
and
friendship
that
existed
there
was
an
interchange
of
those
courtesies
by
which
mutual
good
feeling
seeks
an
outward
expression
the
japanese
had
acknowledged
with
courtly
thanks
the
presents
that
had
been
bestowed
in
behalf
of
the
government
and
now
on
march
invited
the
commodore
to
receive
the
various
gifts
that
had
been
ordered
by
the
emperor
in
return
as
a
public
recognition
of
the
courtesy
of
the
united
states
the
commodore
accordingly
landed
at
yokohama
with
a
suite
of
officers
and
his
interpreters
and
was
received
at
the
with
the
usual
ceremonies
by
the
high
commissioners
the
large
was
crowded
with
the
presents
the
objects
were
of
japanese
manufacture
and
consisted
of
specimens
of
rich
brocades
and
silks
of
their
famous
lacquered
ware
such
as
boxes
tables
trays
and
goblets
all
skilfully
wrought
and
finished
with
an
exquisite
polish
of
porcelain
cups
of
wonderful
lightness
and
transparency
adorned
with
figures
and
flowers
in
gold
and
variegated
colors
and
exhibiting
a
workmanship
that
surpassed
even
that
of
the
ware
for
which
the
chinese
are
remarkable
fans
and
articles
of
apparel
in
ordinary
use
of
no
great
value
but
of
exceeding
interest
were
scattered
among
the
more
luxurious
and
costly
objects
with
the
usual
order
and
neatness
that
seem
almost
instinctive
with
the
japanese
the
various
presents
had
been
arranged
in
lots
and
classified
in
accordance
with
the
rank
of
those
for
whom
they
were
respectively
intended
the
commissioners
took
their
positions
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
and
when
the
commodore
and
his
suite
entered
the
ordinary
compliments
having
been
interchanged
the
prince
hayashi
read
aloud
in
japanese
the
list
of
presents
and
the
names
of
the
persons
to
whom
they
were
to
be
given
this
was
then
translated
by
yenoske
into
dutch
and
by
portman
into
english
this
ceremony
being
over
the
commodore
was
invited
by
the
commissioners
into
the
inner
room
where
he
was
presented
with
two
complete
sets
of
japanese
coins
three
matchlocks
and
two
swords
these
gifts
though
of
no
great
intrinsic
value
were
significant
evidences
of
the
desire
of
the
japanese
to
express
their
respect
for
the
representative
of
the
united
states
the
mere
bestowal
of
the
coins
in
direct
opposition
to
the
japanese
laws
which
absolutely
forbid
all
issue
of
their
money
beyond
the
kingdom
was
an
act
of
marked
favor
as
the
commodore
prepared
to
depart
the
commissioners
said
there
was
one
article
intended
for
the
president
which
had
not
yet
been
exhibited
they
accordingly
conducted
the
commodore
and
his
officers
to
the
beach
where
one
or
two
hundred
sacks
of
rice
were
pointed
out
heaped
up
in
readiness
to
be
sent
on
board
the
ships
as
that
immense
supply
of
substantial
food
seemed
to
excite
some
wonder
on
the
part
of
the
americans
yenoske
the
interpreter
remarked
that
it
was
always
customary
with
the
japanese
when
bestowing
royal
presents
to
include
a
certain
quantity
of
rice
although
he
did
not
say
whether
the
quantity
always
amounted
as
on
the
present
occasion
to
hundreds
of
sacks
while
contemplating
these
substantial
evidences
of
japanese
generosity
the
attention
of
all
was
suddenly
riveted
upon
monstrous
fellows
who
tramped
down
the
beach
like
so
many
huge
elephants
they
were
professional
wrestlers
and
formed
part
of
the
retinue
of
the
princes
who
kept
them
for
their
private
amusement
and
for
public
entertainment
they
were
enormously
tall
and
tremendously
heavy
their
scant
costume
which
was
merely
a
colored
cloth
about
the
loins
adorned
with
fringes
and
emblazoned
with
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
prince
to
whom
each
belonged
revealed
their
gigantic
proportions
in
all
the
bloated
fulness
of
fat
and
extent
of
muscle
two
or
three
of
these
huge
monsters
were
the
most
famous
wrestlers
in
japan
and
ranked
as
the
champion
tom
cribbs
and
sayers
of
the
country
koyanagi
the
reputed
bully
of
the
capital
was
one
of
them
and
paraded
himself
with
the
conscious
pride
of
superior
size
and
strength
he
was
especially
brought
to
the
commodore
that
he
might
examine
his
massive
form
the
commissioners
insisted
that
the
monstrous
fellow
should
be
minutely
inspected
that
the
hardness
of
his
muscle
should
be
felt
and
that
the
fatness
of
his
cushioned
frame
should
be
tested
by
the
touch
the
commodore
accordingly
attempted
to
grasp
his
arm
which
he
found
as
solid
as
it
was
huge
and
then
passed
his
hand
over
the
monstrous
neck
which
fell
in
folds
of
massive
flesh
like
the
dewlap
of
a
prize
ox
as
some
surprise
was
naturally
expressed
at
this
wondrous
exhibition
of
animal
development
the
monster
himself
gave
a
grunt
expressive
of
his
flattered
vanity
they
were
so
enormously
big
that
they
appeared
to
have
lost
their
distinctive
features
and
seemed
to
be
only
masses
of
fat
their
eyes
were
barely
visible
through
a
long
perspective
of
socket
the
prominence
of
their
noses
was
lost
in
the
puffiness
of
their
bloated
cheeks
and
their
heads
were
set
almost
directly
on
their
bodies
with
merely
folds
of
flesh
where
the
neck
and
chin
are
usually
found
their
great
size
however
was
more
owing
to
development
of
muscle
than
to
deposition
of
fat
for
although
they
were
evidently
well
fed
they
were
not
less
well
exercised
and
capable
of
great
feats
of
strength
as
a
preliminary
exhibition
of
the
power
of
these
men
the
princes
set
them
to
removing
the
sacks
of
rice
to
a
convenient
place
on
the
shore
for
shipping
each
of
the
sacks
weighed
not
less
than
one
hundred
pounds
and
there
were
only
two
of
the
wrestlers
who
did
not
carry
each
two
sacks
at
a
time
they
bore
the
sacks
on
the
right
shoulder
lifting
the
first
from
the
ground
and
adjusting
it
without
help
but
obtaining
aid
for
the
raising
of
the
second
one
man
carried
a
sack
suspended
by
his
teeth
and
another
taking
one
in
his
arms
turned
repeated
somersaults
as
he
held
it
apparently
with
as
much
ease
as
if
his
weight
of
flesh
had
been
only
so
much
gossamer
and
his
load
a
feather
after
this
preliminary
display
the
commissioners
proposed
that
the
commodore
and
his
party
should
retire
to
the
where
they
would
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
wrestlers
exhibit
their
professional
feats
from
the
brutal
performance
of
these
wrestlers
the
americans
turned
with
pride
to
the
exhibition
to
which
the
japanese
commissioners
were
now
in
their
turn
invited
of
the
telegraph
and
the
railroad
it
was
a
happy
contrast
which
a
higher
civilization
presented
to
the
disgusting
display
on
the
part
of
the
japanese
officials
in
place
of
the
show
of
brute
animal
force
there
was
a
triumphant
revelation
to
a
partially
enlightened
people
of
the
success
of
science
and
enterprise
the
japanese
took
great
delight
in
seeing
the
rapid
movement
of
the
liliputian
locomotive
and
one
of
the
scribes
of
the
commissioners
took
his
seat
upon
the
car
while
the
engineer
stood
upon
the
tender
feeding
the
furnace
with
one
hand
and
directing
the
diminutive
engine
with
the
other
crowds
of
the
japanese
gathered
round
and
looked
on
the
repeated
circlings
of
the
train
with
unabated
pleasure
and
surprise
unable
to
repress
a
shout
of
delight
at
each
blast
of
the
the
telegraph
with
its
wonders
though
before
witnessed
still
created
renewed
interest
and
all
the
beholders
were
unceasing
in
their
expressions
of
curiosity
and
astonishment
the
agricultural
instruments
having
been
explained
to
the
commissioners
by
doctor
morrow
a
formal
delivery
of
the
telegraph
the
railway
and
other
articles
which
made
up
the
list
of
american
presents
ensued
the
prince
of
mamasaki
had
been
delegated
by
his
coadjutors
ceremoniously
to
accept
and
captain
adams
was
appointed
by
the
commodore
to
deliver
the
gifts
and
each
performed
his
functions
by
an
interchange
of
compliments
and
a
stately
bows
after
this
a
detachment
of
marines
from
the
squadron
were
put
through
their
various
evolutions
while
the
bands
furnished
martial
music
the
japanese
commissioners
seemed
to
take
a
very
great
interest
in
this
military
display
and
expressed
themselves
much
gratified
at
the
soldierly
air
and
excellent
discipline
of
the
men
this
closed
the
performances
of
the
day
the
next
day
march
yenoske
accompanied
by
kenzeiro
his
came
on
board
the
powhatan
to
acknowledge
formally
in
behalf
of
the
commissioners
their
gratitude
for
the
exhibition
of
the
marines
the
locomotive
and
the
telegraph
with
all
which
they
declared
themselves
highly
delighted
yenoske
and
his
coadjutor
were
invited
to
seat
themselves
in
the
cabin
of
the
commodore
and
after
some
expressions
of
courtesy
which
the
japanese
officials
were
careful
never
to
intermit
proposed
to
talk
over
some
points
in
connection
with
the
projected
treaty
the
commodore
said
he
had
no
objections
to
the
discussion
of
the
matters
informally
but
he
protested
against
considering
the
interpreters
as
the
official
representatives
of
the
commissioners
with
the
latter
of
whom
only
he
declared
could
he
treat
authoritatively
monday
march
was
the
day
appointed
for
the
entertainment
to
which
the
commodore
had
invited
the
commissioners
and
their
attendants
accordingly
great
arrangements
were
made
in
the
flagship
preparatory
to
the
occasion
the
quarterdeck
was
adorned
with
a
great
variety
of
flags
and
all
parts
of
the
steamer
were
in
perfect
order
while
the
officers
marines
and
men
dressed
themselves
in
their
uniforms
and
prepared
to
do
honor
in
every
respect
to
their
expected
visitors
as
it
was
known
that
the
strictness
of
japanese
etiquette
would
not
allow
the
high
commissioners
to
sit
at
the
same
table
with
their
subordinates
the
commodore
ordered
two
banquets
one
to
be
spread
in
his
cabin
for
the
chief
dignitaries
and
another
on
the
previous
to
coming
on
board
the
powhatan
the
commissioners
visited
the
macedonian
being
saluted
as
they
stepped
on
her
deck
by
seventeen
guns
from
the
mississippi
lying
near
the
great
guns
and
boarders
having
been
exercised
for
their
entertainment
the
commissioners
with
their
numerous
attendants
left
for
the
powhatan
the
macedonian
firing
a
salvo
in
their
honor
as
they
took
their
departure
on
arriving
on
board
the
flagship
they
were
first
conducted
through
the
different
departments
of
the
steamer
and
examined
with
minute
interest
the
guns
and
the
machinery
a
boat
was
lowered
with
a
howitzer
in
its
bows
and
this
was
repeatedly
discharged
much
to
their
amusement
for
they
evidently
had
a
great
fondness
for
martial
exercise
and
display
the
engines
were
next
put
in
motion
and
they
evinced
the
usual
intelligence
of
the
higher
class
of
japanese
in
their
inquiries
and
remarks
the
commodore
had
invited
the
four
captains
of
the
squadron
his
interpreter
williams
and
his
secretary
to
join
the
commissioners
at
his
table
yenoske
the
japanese
interpreter
was
allowed
the
privilege
as
a
special
condescension
on
the
part
of
his
superiors
to
sit
at
a
in
the
cabin
where
his
humble
position
did
not
seem
to
disturb
either
his
equanimity
or
his
appetite
hayashi
who
always
preserved
his
grave
and
dignified
bearing
ate
and
drank
sparingly
but
tasted
of
every
dish
and
sipped
of
every
kind
of
wine
he
was
the
only
one
in
fact
whose
sobriety
was
proof
against
the
unrestrained
conviviality
that
prevailed
among
his
bacchanalian
coadjutors
the
japanese
party
upon
deck
who
were
entertained
by
a
large
body
of
officers
from
the
various
ships
became
quite
uproarious
under
the
influence
of
overflowing
supplies
of
champagne
madeira
and
punch
which
they
seemed
greatly
to
relish
the
japanese
took
the
lead
in
proposing
healths
and
toasts
and
were
by
no
means
the
most
backward
in
drinking
them
they
kept
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
were
heard
far
above
the
music
of
the
bands
that
enlivened
the
entertainment
by
a
succession
of
brisk
and
cheerful
tunes
in
the
eagerness
of
the
japanese
appetite
there
was
but
little
discrimination
in
the
choice
of
dishes
and
in
the
order
of
courses
and
the
most
startling
heterodoxy
was
exhibited
in
the
confused
commingling
of
fish
flesh
and
fowl
soups
and
syrups
fruits
fricassees
roast
and
boiled
pickles
and
preserves
as
a
most
generous
supply
had
been
provided
there
were
still
some
remnants
of
the
feast
left
after
the
guests
had
satisfied
their
voracity
which
most
of
these
japanese
in
accordance
with
their
custom
stowed
away
about
their
persons
to
carry
off
the
japanese
always
have
an
abundant
supply
of
paper
within
the
left
bosom
of
their
loose
robes
in
a
capacious
pocket
this
is
used
for
various
purposes
one
species
as
soft
as
our
cotton
cloth
and
withal
exceedingly
tough
is
used
for
a
handkerchief
another
furnishes
the
material
for
taking
notes
or
for
wrapping
up
what
is
left
after
a
feast
on
the
present
occasion
when
the
dinner
was
over
all
the
japanese
guests
simultaneously
spread
out
their
long
folds
of
paper
and
gathering
what
scraps
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
without
regard
to
the
kind
of
food
made
up
an
envelope
of
conglomerate
eatables
in
which
there
was
such
a
confusion
of
the
sour
and
sweet
the
albuminous
oleaginous
and
saccharine
that
the
chemistry
of
liebig
or
the
practised
taste
of
the
commodore
parisian
cook
would
never
have
reached
a
satisfactory
analysis
they
not
only
always
followed
this
practice
themselves
but
insisted
that
their
american
guests
when
entertained
at
a
japanese
feast
should
adopt
it
also
whenever
the
commodore
and
his
officers
were
feasted
on
shore
paper
parcels
of
the
remnants
were
thrust
into
their
hands
on
leaving
after
the
banquet
the
japanese
were
entertained
by
an
exhibition
of
negro
minstrelsy
got
up
by
some
of
the
sailors
the
gravity
of
the
saturnine
hayashi
was
not
proof
against
the
grotesque
exhibition
and
even
he
joined
in
the
general
hilarity
it
was
now
sunset
and
the
japanese
prepared
to
depart
with
quite
as
much
wine
in
them
as
they
could
well
bear
the
jovial
matsusaki
threw
his
arms
about
the
commodore
neck
crushing
in
his
tipsy
embrace
a
pair
of
new
epaulettes
and
repeating
in
japanese
with
maudlin
affection
these
words
as
interpreted
into
english
nippon
and
america
all
the
same
heart
he
then
went
toddling
into
his
boat
supported
by
some
of
his
more
steady
companions
and
soon
all
the
happy
party
had
left
the
ships
and
were
making
rapidly
for
the
shore
the
saratoga
fired
the
salute
of
seventeen
guns
as
the
last
boat
pulled
off
from
the
powhatan
and
the
squadron
was
once
more
left
in
the
usual
quiet
of
ordinary
ship
duty
the
following
day
the
commodore
landed
to
have
a
conference
in
regard
to
the
remaining
points
of
the
treaty
previous
to
signing
he
was
met
at
the
by
the
commissioners
as
soon
as
the
commodore
had
taken
his
seat
a
letter
was
handed
to
him
which
the
japanese
said
they
had
just
received
from
simoda
it
was
from
commander
pope
and
had
been
transmitted
through
the
authorities
overland
its
contents
gave
a
satisfactory
report
of
simoda
and
the
commodore
at
once
said
he
accepted
that
port
but
declared
that
it
must
be
opened
without
delay
hakodate
he
added
would
do
for
the
other
and
napha
in
riu
kiu
loo
choo
islands
could
be
retained
for
the
third
in
regard
to
the
other
two
he
was
willing
he
said
to
postpone
their
consideration
to
some
other
time
the
commodore
now
proposed
to
sign
the
agreement
in
regard
to
the
three
ports
and
directed
his
interpreter
to
read
it
in
dutch
when
the
document
had
been
thus
read
and
afterward
carefully
perused
by
the
japanese
they
said
they
were
prepared
to
concur
in
everything
except
as
to
the
opening
of
simoda
after
discussion
it
was
finally
settled
that
though
the
port
might
be
opened
the
japanese
would
address
a
note
to
the
commodore
saying
that
not
everything
which
might
be
wanting
by
ships
would
be
furnished
there
before
the
expiration
of
ten
months
but
that
wood
and
water
and
whatever
else
the
place
possessed
would
be
supplied
immediately
and
to
this
note
the
commodore
promised
to
reply
and
express
his
satisfaction
with
such
an
arrangement
the
question
now
came
up
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
privileges
to
be
granted
to
americans
who
might
visit
simoda
in
the
discussion
of
which
it
was
plain
that
the
japanese
meant
to
be
distinctly
understood
as
prohibiting
absolutely
at
least
for
the
present
the
permanent
residence
of
americans
with
their
families
in
japan
the
distance
also
to
which
americans
might
extend
their
excursions
into
the
country
around
the
ports
of
simoda
and
hakodate
was
settled
and
it
is
observable
that
at
the
special
request
of
the
japanese
the
commodore
named
the
distance
they
assenting
at
once
to
that
which
he
mentioned
the
proposition
to
have
consular
agents
residing
in
japan
evidently
gave
great
anxiety
to
the
commissioners
the
commodore
was
firm
in
saying
there
must
be
such
agents
for
the
sake
of
the
japanese
themselves
as
well
as
for
that
of
his
own
countrymen
and
it
was
finally
conceded
that
there
should
be
one
to
live
at
simoda
and
that
he
should
not
be
appointed
until
a
year
and
eighteen
months
from
the
date
of
the
treaty
two
more
articles
including
the
new
points
that
had
been
discussed
were
now
added
to
the
transcript
of
the
proposed
treaty
the
japanese
promised
to
bring
on
board
the
powhatan
next
day
a
copy
in
dutch
of
their
understanding
of
the
agreement
as
far
as
concurred
in
and
the
commodore
departed
in
the
next
two
days
several
notes
passed
between
the
commodore
and
the
japanese
commissioners
in
the
course
of
which
various
questions
that
had
been
already
considered
were
definitely
settled
and
the
american
interpreters
were
occupied
in
cooperation
with
the
japanese
in
drawing
up
the
treaty
in
the
chinese
dutch
and
japanese
languages
on
the
the
ships
vandalia
and
southampton
arrived
from
simoda
with
the
confirmation
of
what
commander
pope
had
already
said
in
his
despatch
which
had
been
transmitted
by
the
japanese
authorities
overland
to
the
commodore
namely
that
the
harbor
and
town
of
simoda
had
been
found
on
examination
suitable
in
every
respect
for
the
purposes
of
the
americans
all
was
now
in
readiness
for
the
final
signing
of
the
treaty
accordingly
on
friday
march
the
commodore
went
to
the
with
his
usual
attendants
and
immediately
on
his
arrival
signed
three
several
drafts
of
the
treaty
written
in
the
english
language
and
delivered
them
to
the
commissioners
together
with
three
copies
of
the
same
in
the
dutch
and
chinese
languages
certified
by
the
interpreters
williams
and
portman
for
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
the
japanese
commissioners
in
behalf
of
their
government
handed
to
the
commodore
three
drafts
of
the
treaty
written
respectively
in
the
japanese
chinese
and
dutch
languages
and
signed
by
the
four
of
their
body
delegated
by
the
emperor
for
that
purpose
immediately
on
the
signing
and
exchange
of
the
copies
of
the
treaty
the
commodore
presented
the
first
commissioner
prince
hayashi
with
an
american
flag
remarking
that
he
considered
it
the
highest
expression
of
national
courtesy
and
friendship
he
could
offer
the
prince
was
evidently
deeply
impressed
with
this
significant
mark
of
amity
and
returned
his
thanks
for
it
with
indications
of
great
feeling
the
commodore
then
presented
the
other
dignitaries
with
the
various
gifts
he
had
especially
reserved
for
them
all
formal
business
being
now
concluded
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
parties
the
japanese
commissioners
invited
the
commodore
and
his
officers
to
partake
of
an
entertainment
prepared
for
the
occasion
the
tables
were
spread
in
the
large
reception
hall
these
were
wide
divans
such
as
were
used
for
seats
and
of
the
same
height
they
were
covered
with
a
crape
and
arranged
in
order
according
to
the
rank
of
the
guests
and
their
hosts
an
upper
table
raised
somewhat
above
the
rest
being
appropriated
to
the
commodore
his
superior
officers
and
the
commissioners
when
all
were
seated
the
servitors
brought
in
a
rapid
succession
of
courses
consisting
chiefly
of
thick
soups
or
rather
stews
in
most
of
which
fresh
fish
was
a
component
part
these
were
served
in
small
earthen
bowls
or
cups
and
were
brought
in
upon
lacquered
stands
about
fourteen
inches
square
and
ten
inches
high
and
placed
one
before
each
guest
upon
the
tables
together
with
each
dish
was
a
supply
of
soy
or
some
other
condiment
while
throughout
there
was
an
abundant
quantity
served
in
peculiar
vessels
of
the
japanese
national
liquor
the
a
sort
of
whiskey
distilled
from
rice
various
sweetened
confections
and
a
multiplicity
of
cakes
were
liberally
interspersed
among
the
other
articles
on
the
tables
toward
the
close
of
the
feast
a
plate
containing
a
broiled
crawfish
a
piece
of
fried
fish
of
some
kind
two
or
three
boiled
shrimps
and
a
small
square
pudding
with
something
of
the
consistence
of
blancmange
was
placed
before
each
with
a
hint
that
they
were
to
follow
the
guests
on
their
return
to
the
ships
and
they
were
accordingly
sent
and
duly
received
afterward
after
the
feast
which
passed
pleasantly
and
convivially
compliments
being
freely
exchanged
and
healths
drunk
in
liliputian
cups
of
sake
the
commissioners
expressed
great
anxiety
about
the
proposed
visit
of
the
commodore
to
yedo
they
earnestly
urged
him
not
to
take
his
ships
any
farther
up
the
bay
as
they
said
it
would
lead
to
trouble
by
which
the
populace
might
be
disturbed
and
their
own
lives
perhaps
jeoparded
the
commodore
argued
the
matter
with
them
for
some
time
and
as
they
still
pertinaciously
urged
their
objections
to
his
visit
to
the
capital
it
was
agreed
that
the
subject
should
be
further
discussed
by
an
interchange
of
notes
the
meeting
then
broke
up
when
it
was
determined
by
our
government
to
send
an
expedition
to
japan
those
in
authority
were
not
unmindful
of
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
that
singular
nation
unlike
all
other
civilized
peoples
it
was
in
a
state
of
voluntary
and
determined
isolation
it
neither
desired
nor
sought
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
world
but
on
the
contrary
strove
to
the
uttermost
to
prevent
it
it
was
comparatively
an
easy
task
to
propose
to
any
power
the
ports
of
which
were
freely
visited
by
ships
from
every
part
of
the
world
the
terms
of
a
commercial
treaty
but
not
so
when
by
any
power
commerce
itself
was
interdicted
before
general
conditions
of
commerce
could
be
proposed
to
such
a
power
it
was
necessary
to
settle
the
great
preliminary
that
commerce
would
be
allowed
at
all
again
if
that
preliminary
was
settled
affirmatively
a
second
point
of
great
moment
remained
to
be
discussed
to
what
degree
shall
intercourse
for
trading
be
extended
among
nations
accustomed
to
the
usages
of
christendom
the
principles
and
extent
of
national
comity
in
the
interchanges
of
commercial
transactions
have
been
so
long
and
so
well
defined
and
understood
that
as
between
them
the
term
commercial
treaty
needs
no
explanation
its
meaning
is
comprehended
alike
by
all
and
in
its
stipulations
it
may
cover
the
very
broad
extent
that
includes
everything
involved
in
the
operations
of
commerce
between
two
maritime
nations
but
in
a
kingdom
which
in
its
polity
expressly
ignored
commerce
and
repudiated
it
as
an
evil
instead
of
a
good
it
was
necessary
to
lay
the
very
foundation
as
well
as
to
adjust
the
terms
hence
the
instructions
to
commodore
perry
covered
broad
ground
and
his
letters
of
credence
conformed
to
his
instructions
if
he
found
the
japanese
disposed
to
abandon
at
once
and
forever
their
deliberately
adopted
plan
of
with
foreigners
an
event
most
unlikely
his
powers
were
ample
to
make
with
them
a
commercial
treaty
as
wide
and
general
as
any
we
have
with
the
nations
of
europe
if
they
were
disposed
to
relax
but
in
part
their
jealous
and
suspicious
system
formally
to
profess
relations
of
friendship
and
opening
some
only
of
their
ports
to
our
vessels
to
allow
a
trade
in
those
ports
between
their
people
and
ours
he
was
authorized
to
negotiate
for
this
purpose
and
secure
for
his
country
such
privileges
as
he
could
not
inconsistent
with
the
which
as
a
nation
we
owed
to
ourselves
it
must
not
be
forgotten
in
the
contemplation
of
what
was
accomplished
that
our
representative
went
to
a
people
who
at
the
time
of
his
arrival
among
them
had
both
by
positive
law
and
usage
of
more
than
two
hundred
years
allowed
but
one
of
their
harbors
nagasaki
to
be
opened
to
foreigners
at
all
had
permitted
no
trade
with
such
foreigners
when
they
did
come
except
under
stringent
regulations
with
the
dutch
and
the
chinese
were
in
the
habit
of
communicating
with
the
world
outside
of
them
at
only
through
the
medium
of
the
dutch
who
were
imprisoned
at
dezima
and
a
people
who
as
far
as
we
know
never
made
a
formal
treaty
with
a
civilized
nation
in
the
whole
course
of
their
history
there
were
but
two
points
on
which
the
commodore
instructions
did
not
allow
him
a
large
discretion
to
be
exercised
according
to
circumstances
these
were
first
that
if
happily
any
arrangements
for
trade
either
general
or
special
were
made
it
was
to
be
distinctly
stipulated
that
under
no
circumstances
and
in
no
degree
would
the
americans
submit
to
the
humiliating
treatment
so
long
borne
by
the
dutch
in
carrying
on
their
trade
the
citizens
of
our
country
must
be
dealt
with
as
freemen
or
there
should
be
no
dealings
at
all
the
second
point
was
that
in
the
event
of
any
of
our
countrymen
being
cast
in
god
providence
as
shipwrecked
men
on
the
coast
of
japan
they
should
not
be
treated
as
prisoners
confined
in
cages
or
subjected
to
inhuman
treatment
but
should
be
received
with
kindness
and
hospitably
cared
for
until
they
could
leave
the
country
the
nearest
approach
to
a
precedent
was
to
be
found
in
our
treaty
with
china
made
in
this
therefore
was
carefully
studied
by
the
commodore
its
purport
was
a
treaty
or
general
convention
of
peace
amity
and
commerce
and
to
settle
the
rules
to
be
mutually
observed
in
the
intercourse
of
the
respective
countries
so
far
as
commerce
is
concerned
it
permitted
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
frequent
five
ports
in
china
and
to
reside
with
their
families
and
trade
there
and
to
proceed
at
pleasure
with
their
vessels
and
merchandise
to
or
from
any
foreign
port
and
from
either
of
the
said
five
ports
to
enter
any
other
of
them
as
to
duties
on
articles
imported
they
were
to
pay
according
to
a
tariff
that
was
made
part
of
the
treaty
and
in
no
case
were
to
be
subjected
to
higher
duties
than
those
paid
under
similar
circumstances
by
the
people
of
other
nations
consuls
were
provided
for
to
reside
at
the
five
open
ports
and
those
trading
there
were
permitted
to
import
from
their
own
or
any
other
ports
into
china
and
sell
there
and
purchase
therein
and
export
to
their
own
or
any
other
ports
all
manner
of
merchandise
of
which
the
importation
or
exportation
was
not
prohibited
by
the
treaty
in
short
so
far
as
the
five
ports
were
concerned
there
existed
between
us
and
china
a
general
treaty
of
commerce
the
commodore
caused
to
be
prepared
in
the
chinese
characters
a
transcript
of
the
treaty
with
such
verbal
alterations
as
would
make
it
applicable
to
japan
with
the
view
of
exhibiting
it
to
the
imperial
commissioners
of
that
country
should
he
be
so
successful
as
to
open
negotiations
he
was
not
sanguine
enough
to
hope
that
he
could
procure
an
entire
adoption
of
the
chinese
treaty
by
the
japanese
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
difference
in
national
characteristics
between
the
inhabitants
of
china
and
the
more
independent
and
sturdy
natives
of
the
japanese
islands
he
knew
that
the
latter
held
the
former
in
some
degree
of
contempt
and
treated
them
in
the
matter
of
trade
very
much
as
they
treated
the
dutch
he
was
also
aware
that
the
chinese
when
they
made
their
treaty
did
know
something
of
the
advantages
that
might
result
from
intercourse
with
the
rest
of
the
world
while
as
to
the
japanese
in
their
isolation
either
they
neither
knew
nor
desired
such
advantages
or
if
they
knew
them
feared
they
might
be
purchased
at
too
high
a
price
in
the
introduction
of
foreigners
who
as
in
the
case
of
the
portuguese
centuries
before
might
seek
to
overturn
the
empire
it
was
too
much
therefore
to
expect
that
the
japanese
would
in
all
the
particulars
of
a
treaty
imitate
the
chinese
of
the
difficulties
encountered
even
after
the
japanese
had
consented
to
negotiate
the
best
account
may
be
given
from
the
conferences
and
discussions
between
the
negotiators
of
all
which
most
accurate
reports
were
kept
on
both
sides
in
the
form
of
dialogue
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
commodore
with
the
imperial
commissioners
on
march
he
acted
on
the
plan
he
had
proposed
to
himself
with
respect
to
the
treaty
with
china
and
thus
addressed
them
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
the
two
nations
that
a
treaty
similar
to
the
one
between
my
country
and
the
chinese
should
be
made
between
us
i
have
prepared
the
draft
of
one
almost
identical
with
our
treaty
with
china
i
have
been
sent
here
by
my
government
to
make
a
treaty
with
yours
if
i
do
not
succeed
now
my
government
will
probably
send
more
ships
here
but
i
hope
we
shall
soon
settle
matters
amicably
we
wish
for
time
to
have
the
document
translated
into
the
japanese
language
this
was
but
one
among
a
hundred
proofs
of
their
extreme
suspicion
and
caution
for
there
was
not
one
of
the
imperial
commissioners
probably
who
could
not
have
read
without
the
least
difficulty
the
document
as
furnished
by
the
commodore
and
certain
it
is
that
their
interpreters
could
have
read
it
off
into
japanese
at
once
the
commodore
who
wished
to
do
as
far
as
possible
everything
that
might
conciliate
of
course
made
no
objection
to
a
request
so
seemingly
reasonable
though
he
knew
it
to
be
needless
and
was
content
to
wait
patiently
for
their
reply
in
one
week
that
reply
came
in
writing
and
was
very
explicit
as
to
opening
a
trade
such
as
is
now
carried
on
by
china
with
your
country
we
certainly
can
not
yet
bring
it
about
the
feelings
and
manners
of
our
people
are
very
unlike
those
of
other
nations
and
it
will
be
exceedingly
difficult
even
if
you
wish
it
to
change
immediately
the
old
regulations
for
those
of
other
countries
moreover
the
chinese
have
long
had
intercourse
with
western
nations
while
we
have
had
dealings
at
nagasaki
with
only
the
people
of
holland
and
china
this
answer
was
not
entirely
unexpected
and
put
an
end
to
all
prospect
of
negotiating
a
commercial
treaty
in
the
european
sense
of
that
phrase
it
only
remained
therefore
to
secure
for
the
present
admission
into
the
kingdom
and
so
much
of
trade
as
japanese
jealousy
could
be
brought
to
concede
at
length
after
much
and
discussion
the
point
was
yielded
that
certain
ports
might
be
opened
to
our
vessels
and
then
in
the
interview
of
march
came
up
the
subject
of
consuls
about
the
appointment
of
consuls
or
agents
the
commissioners
desire
a
delay
of
four
or
five
years
to
see
how
the
intercourse
works
the
governor
of
the
town
and
the
official
interpreter
will
be
able
to
carry
on
all
the
business
of
supplying
provisions
coal
and
needed
articles
with
the
captain
without
the
intervention
of
a
consul
the
duties
of
a
consul
are
to
report
all
difficulties
that
arise
between
american
citizens
and
japanese
to
his
government
in
an
authentic
manner
assist
the
japanese
in
carrying
out
their
laws
and
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
and
recovering
debts
made
by
the
americans
and
also
communicating
to
the
government
at
washington
whatever
the
japanese
wish
as
no
letters
can
be
received
after
this
through
the
dutch
and
if
no
consuls
are
received
then
a
must
remain
in
japan
constantly
and
her
captain
must
do
the
duties
of
a
consul
if
we
had
not
felt
great
confidence
in
you
we
should
not
have
consented
to
open
our
ports
at
all
consuls
may
be
accepted
by
and
by
after
experience
has
shown
their
need
and
we
hope
that
all
american
citizens
obey
the
laws
of
their
country
and
behave
properly
true
and
i
hope
no
difficulty
will
arise
and
this
appointment
of
consuls
in
japan
as
they
are
in
china
hawaii
and
everywhere
else
is
to
prevent
and
provide
for
difficulties
no
american
will
report
his
own
misdeeds
to
his
own
government
nor
can
the
japanese
bring
them
to
our
notice
except
through
a
government
agent
this
provision
must
be
in
the
treaty
though
i
will
stipulate
for
only
one
to
reside
at
simoda
and
he
will
not
be
sent
probably
for
a
year
or
two
from
this
time
and
thus
it
was
that
the
commodore
had
to
explain
everything
and
feel
his
way
step
by
step
in
the
progress
of
the
whole
negotiation
the
commissioners
wish
every
point
desired
by
the
admiral
to
be
stated
clearly
for
the
japanese
are
not
equal
to
the
americans
and
have
not
much
to
give
in
exchange
i
have
already
stated
all
my
views
as
regards
our
intercourse
in
the
draft
of
the
treaty
you
have
this
was
one
prepared
by
the
commodore
after
the
rejection
of
the
transcript
of
the
chinese
treaty
let
the
commissioners
state
their
objections
to
it
this
treaty
now
to
be
made
is
only
a
beginning
and
as
the
nations
know
each
other
the
japanese
will
permit
americans
to
go
anywhere
to
fujiyama
all
over
the
country
we
have
found
restrictions
necessary
against
the
portuguese
and
the
english
then
followed
observations
by
the
japanese
on
pellew
entry
into
nagasaki
harbor
which
showed
how
much
dislike
of
the
english
that
event
had
occasioned
a
strong
proof
of
their
remarkable
caution
was
furnished
by
the
japanese
at
the
conference
held
on
march
when
most
of
the
terms
of
the
treaty
had
been
agreed
upon
i
am
prepared
now
to
sign
the
treaty
about
these
three
harbors
portman
interpreter
then
read
in
dutch
that
portion
of
the
treaty
which
contained
such
points
as
had
been
already
agreed
upon
it
is
all
correct
except
that
we
have
objection
to
opening
the
port
of
simoda
immediately
if
any
vessels
were
to
go
there
in
distress
we
should
be
glad
to
furnish
them
with
provisions
wood
and
water
you
have
already
consented
in
one
of
your
letters
to
me
to
open
that
port
immediately
i
am
very
desirous
of
settling
that
matter
now
as
i
wish
to
despatch
the
saratoga
home
to
inform
the
government
before
congress
adjourns
how
matters
are
advancing
that
will
take
some
time
and
there
is
no
probability
that
any
ships
will
come
here
before
ten
or
twelve
months
have
expired
so
that
it
will
make
no
difference
to
you
whether
you
put
it
in
the
treaty
to
be
opened
now
or
in
ten
months
we
are
willing
to
put
it
in
the
treaty
to
be
opened
now
if
you
will
give
us
a
letter
or
promise
that
no
ships
will
come
here
before
the
president
gives
his
permission
i
can
not
do
that
very
well
but
i
am
willing
to
put
it
off
ninety
days
that
will
be
about
the
time
i
shall
return
from
hakodate
it
was
your
own
proposition
yesterday
to
open
that
port
immediately
i
consent
to
this
however
to
show
you
how
desirous
i
am
to
do
what
i
can
to
please
you
i
can
not
consent
to
a
longer
time
if
we
put
it
in
the
treaty
to
be
opened
now
we
would
like
you
to
give
us
an
order
that
no
ships
shall
enter
that
port
before
ten
months
i
can
not
do
that
but
there
is
no
probability
that
any
ships
will
come
here
before
that
time
as
i
shall
not
leave
here
for
three
months
and
they
will
not
hear
of
it
before
that
time
and
when
they
do
hear
of
it
it
will
take
several
months
for
ships
to
make
the
voyage
here
if
you
choose
i
will
keep
one
of
the
ships
at
simoda
for
several
months
if
ships
go
there
before
that
time
we
shall
not
be
able
to
give
them
other
than
provisions
wood
and
water
the
ships
that
may
go
there
will
want
such
things
only
as
you
may
have
if
you
have
them
not
of
course
you
can
not
and
will
not
be
expected
to
furnish
them
but
as
i
said
before
there
is
no
probability
that
ships
will
go
there
before
the
expiration
of
ten
months
when
you
come
back
from
matsumai
we
shall
have
plenty
of
provisions
at
simoda
for
the
whole
squadron
but
to
other
ships
we
can
not
furnish
more
than
wood
water
etc
when
we
return
from
matsumai
we
shall
not
want
many
provisions
as
we
shall
be
going
to
a
place
where
we
shall
get
plenty
it
is
only
the
principle
i
wish
settled
now
i
have
come
here
as
a
peacemaker
and
i
desire
to
settle
everything
now
and
thus
prevent
trouble
hereafter
i
wish
to
write
home
to
my
government
that
the
japanese
are
friends
we
will
write
you
a
letter
stating
that
we
can
not
furnish
you
anything
before
ten
months
but
that
we
can
furnish
wood
and
water
immediately
and
that
we
will
furnish
such
other
things
as
we
possibly
can
this
letter
we
should
like
you
to
answer
very
well
i
will
entering
on
another
part
of
the
terms
agreed
on
we
will
not
confine
americans
or
prevent
them
from
walking
around
but
we
should
like
to
place
a
limit
to
the
distance
they
may
walk
i
am
prepared
to
settle
that
matter
now
but
they
must
not
be
confined
to
any
particular
house
or
street
suppose
we
make
the
distance
they
may
walk
the
same
distance
that
a
man
can
go
and
come
in
a
day
or
if
you
choose
the
number
of
or
may
be
agreed
upon
we
are
willing
that
they
shall
walk
as
far
as
they
can
go
and
come
in
a
day
there
is
no
probability
that
sailors
would
wish
to
go
on
shore
more
than
once
from
curiosity
besides
they
will
have
their
daily
duties
to
attend
to
on
board
ship
and
will
not
be
able
to
go
on
shore
we
do
not
wish
any
women
to
come
and
remain
at
simoda
the
probability
is
that
few
women
will
go
there
and
they
only
the
wives
of
the
officers
of
the
ships
when
you
come
back
from
matsumai
we
should
like
to
settle
the
distance
that
americans
are
to
walk
it
is
difficult
for
to
settle
the
distance
say
the
distance
of
seven
japanese
miles
in
any
direction
from
the
centre
of
the
city
of
simoda
very
well
a
few
miles
will
make
no
difference
you
are
requested
not
to
leave
agents
until
after
you
have
experienced
that
it
is
necessary
i
am
willing
to
defer
the
appointment
of
a
consul
or
an
agent
one
year
or
eighteen
months
from
the
date
of
the
signing
the
treaty
and
then
if
my
government
think
it
necessary
it
will
send
one
in
fact
not
an
article
of
the
treaty
was
made
without
the
most
serious
deliberation
by
the
japanese
in
answer
to
a
question
from
captain
adams
in
the
very
first
stages
of
the
negotiation
they
replied
the
japanese
are
unlike
the
chinese
they
are
adverse
to
change
and
when
they
make
a
compact
of
any
kind
they
intend
that
it
shall
endure
for
a
thousand
years
for
this
reason
it
will
be
best
to
deliberate
and
examine
well
the
facilities
for
trade
and
the
suitableness
of
the
port
before
any
one
is
determined
on
probably
nothing
but
the
exercise
of
the
most
perfect
truthfulness
and
patience
would
ever
have
succeeded
in
making
a
treaty
with
them
at
all
and
from
the
language
of
one
of
their
communications
it
is
obvious
that
with
characteristic
caution
they
meant
that
their
present
action
should
be
but
a
beginning
of
intercourse
which
might
or
might
not
be
afterward
made
more
extensive
according
to
the
results
of
what
they
deemed
the
experiment
this
it
must
be
remembered
was
the
first
formal
treaty
they
ever
made
on
the
subject
of
foreign
trade
at
least
since
the
expulsion
of
the
portuguese
and
they
evidently
meant
to
proceed
cautiously
by
single
steps
there
is
observable
throughout
the
negotiations
the
predominating
influence
of
the
national
prejudice
against
the
permanent
introduction
of
foreigners
among
them
the
word
reside
is
but
once
used
in
the
whole
treaty
and
that
in
the
article
relative
to
consuls
the
details
of
conferences
already
given
show
how
anxiously
they
sought
to
avoid
having
consuls
at
all
indeed
commodore
perry
says
i
could
only
induce
the
commissioners
to
agree
to
this
article
by
endeavoring
to
convince
them
that
it
would
save
the
japanese
government
much
trouble
if
an
american
agent
were
to
reside
at
one
or
both
of
the
ports
opened
by
the
treaty
to
whom
complaints
might
be
made
of
any
malpractice
of
the
united
states
citizens
who
might
visit
the
japanese
dominions
they
wanted
no
permanent
foreign
residents
among
them
official
or
unofficial
this
was
shown
most
unequivocally
in
the
remark
already
recorded
in
one
of
the
conferences
we
do
not
wish
any
women
to
come
and
remain
at
simoda
simoda
was
one
of
the
ports
open
for
trade
with
us
they
knew
that
our
people
had
wives
and
daughters
and
that
a
man
family
were
ordinarily
resident
with
him
in
his
permanent
abode
and
that
if
the
head
of
the
family
lived
in
simoda
as
a
japanese
would
live
there
would
certainly
be
women
who
would
come
and
remain
at
simoda
but
more
than
this
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
commodore
had
submitted
to
them
our
treaty
with
china
and
they
had
held
it
under
consideration
for
a
week
at
the
end
of
which
time
they
said
as
to
opening
a
trade
such
as
is
now
carried
on
by
china
with
your
country
we
certainly
can
not
yet
bring
it
about
the
chinese
have
long
had
intercourse
with
western
nations
while
we
have
had
dealings
at
nagasaki
with
only
the
people
of
holland
and
china
now
what
was
such
a
trade
as
we
carried
on
with
china
the
japanese
read
in
our
treaty
that
five
ports
were
open
to
us
that
permission
was
given
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
frequent
them
and
further
to
reside
with
their
families
and
trade
there
this
they
deliberately
declined
assenting
to
when
they
refused
to
make
a
treaty
similar
to
that
with
china
they
surely
would
not
afterward
knowingly
insert
it
in
any
treaty
they
might
make
with
us
the
only
permanent
residence
to
which
they
gave
assent
and
that
most
reluctantly
was
the
residence
of
a
consul
temporary
residence
was
allowed
to
our
shipwrecked
citizens
as
well
as
to
those
who
went
to
simoda
or
hakodate
on
commercial
business
they
are
allowed
to
land
to
walk
where
they
please
within
certain
limits
to
enter
shops
and
temples
without
restriction
to
purchase
in
the
shops
and
have
the
articles
sent
to
the
proper
public
office
duly
marked
where
they
will
pay
for
them
to
resort
to
or
inns
that
are
to
be
built
for
their
refreshment
when
on
shore
at
simoda
and
hakodate
and
until
built
a
temple
at
each
place
is
assigned
as
a
for
persons
in
their
walks
they
may
accept
invitations
to
partake
of
the
hospitality
of
any
of
the
japanese
but
they
are
not
permitted
to
enter
military
establishments
or
private
houses
without
leave
without
leave
our
citizens
can
not
enter
them
within
the
territories
of
any
nation
with
which
we
have
a
treaty
in
short
the
whole
treaty
shows
that
the
purpose
of
the
japanese
was
to
make
the
experiment
of
intercourse
with
us
before
they
made
it
as
extensive
or
as
intimate
as
it
was
between
us
and
the
chinese
it
was
all
they
could
do
at
the
time
and
much
very
much
was
obtained
on
the
part
of
our
negotiator
in
procuring
a
concession
even
to
this
extent
but
as
he
knew
that
our
success
would
be
but
the
forerunner
of
that
of
other
powers
and
as
he
believed
that
new
relations
of
trade
once
commenced
not
only
with
ourselves
but
with
england
france
holland
and
russia
could
not
fail
in
the
progress
of
events
to
break
up
the
old
restrictive
policy
effectually
and
forever
and
open
japan
to
the
world
and
must
also
lead
gradually
to
liberal
commercial
treaties
he
wisely
in
the
ninth
article
secured
to
the
united
states
and
their
citizens
without
consultation
or
delay
all
privileges
and
advantages
which
japan
might
hereafter
grant
to
any
other
nation
or
nations
and
the
commodore
comments
on
this
article
conclusively
show
that
at
least
did
not
suppose
he
had
made
a
commercial
treaty
article
ix
this
is
a
most
important
article
as
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
on
hearing
of
the
success
of
this
mission
the
english
french
and
russians
will
follow
our
example
and
it
may
be
reasonable
to
suppose
that
each
will
gain
some
additional
advantage
until
a
commercial
treaty
is
accomplished
article
ix
will
give
to
americans
without
further
consultation
all
these
advantages
all
other
powers
were
forced
to
be
content
in
obtaining
just
what
we
as
pioneers
obtained
their
treaties
were
like
ours
that
of
russia
was
copied
from
ours
with
no
change
but
that
of
the
substitution
of
the
port
of
nagasaki
for
napha
in
riu
kiu
we
respectfully
submit
therefore
that
all
and
indeed
more
than
all
under
the
circumstances
that
could
have
been
reasonably
expected
has
been
accomplished
the
capture
of
sebastopol
sir
edward
hamely
and
sir
evelyn
wood
this
is
the
most
famous
event
of
the
crimean
war
in
which
russian
power
was
pitted
against
the
allied
forces
of
turkey
france
great
britain
and
sardinia
the
war
grew
out
of
rival
demands
concerning
a
protectorate
in
turkey
in
napoleon
iii
asked
for
the
restoration
of
the
protectorate
of
the
holy
places
in
the
ottoman
empire
to
the
latin
church
supported
by
russia
the
greek
church
had
virtually
supplanted
the
latin
church
in
turkish
dominions
and
russia
now
put
forward
a
demand
for
a
protectorate
over
the
greek
subjects
of
the
sultan
turkey
had
no
interest
in
the
religious
questions
at
issue
and
she
pursued
a
wavering
course
between
the
disputing
powers
fearing
to
offend
either
of
them
russia
at
last
began
openly
to
threaten
turkey
and
finding
vacillation
and
diplomacy
no
longer
availing
for
a
postponement
of
the
conflict
the
sultan
declared
war
october
in
the
early
engagements
of
the
war
the
turks
gained
some
successes
over
russian
troops
but
the
first
important
event
was
the
destruction
of
a
part
of
the
turkish
fleet
at
sinope
november
this
being
regarded
by
england
as
an
act
of
treachery
on
the
part
of
russia
brought
great
britain
into
the
conflict
the
russians
occupied
the
danubian
principalities
and
the
battle
of
the
alma
in
which
the
allies
first
confronted
russia
was
won
by
the
former
with
greatly
superior
numbers
september
the
siege
of
sebastopol
began
in
october
and
during
its
progress
important
battles
occurred
that
of
balaklava
that
of
inkerman
november
in
which
the
russians
were
defeated
by
the
english
and
the
french
that
of
tchernaya
august
a
victory
for
the
russians
and
the
storming
of
the
malakoff
described
below
the
capture
of
sebastopol
was
followed
by
the
taking
of
kars
by
the
russians
november
and
the
war
ended
in
accordance
with
the
treaty
of
paris
march
russia
abandoned
her
claim
to
a
protectorate
over
christians
in
turkey
and
the
sultan
agreed
to
grant
them
more
favorable
terms
sir
edward
bruce
hamley
and
sir
henry
evelyn
wood
british
generals
who
served
in
the
crimean
war
give
us
the
best
accounts
of
the
siege
and
capture
of
sebastopol
in
which
they
were
active
participants
the
siege
had
continued
through
many
weeks
without
decisive
developments
when
on
june
the
french
made
a
strong
but
unsuccessful
assault
on
the
malakoff
which
like
the
redan
formed
one
of
the
main
defences
the
following
narratives
describe
the
british
assault
on
the
redan
and
the
final
storming
of
the
malakoff
by
the
french
sir
edward
bruce
hamley
seeing
how
desperate
was
the
condition
of
the
fortress
prince
gortschakoff
had
resolved
after
the
battle
of
the
tchernaya
to
abandon
sebastopol
in
letters
to
the
minister
of
war
of
august
and
he
expressed
this
intention
saying
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
army
who
would
not
call
it
folly
to
continue
the
defence
longer
with
a
view
to
conducting
a
retreat
he
pressed
forward
rapidly
the
construction
of
the
bridge
across
the
harbor
which
was
to
have
a
roadway
of
sixteen
feet
and
to
bear
heavy
vehicles
he
also
conferred
with
todleben
on
other
measures
to
protect
the
withdrawal
and
accordingly
barricades
were
built
across
the
streets
and
formed
into
armed
and
defensible
works
which
were
intended
as
a
last
resort
to
hold
in
check
the
assailants
preparations
were
also
made
for
blowing
up
the
principal
forts
and
magazines
another
great
cannonade
had
begun
on
august
the
french
lines
had
now
approached
so
close
to
the
place
that
new
additions
to
them
were
immediately
destroyed
or
rendered
untenable
by
the
fire
from
the
malakoff
and
little
redan
and
the
shower
of
small
shells
easily
cast
into
the
trenches
from
the
ramparts
and
called
by
the
french
bouquets
greatly
increased
their
losses
for
the
silencing
of
the
artillery
which
thus
hindered
the
french
sappers
the
allied
batteries
opened
in
full
force
against
the
part
of
the
enemy
lines
from
the
redan
to
the
great
harbor
but
the
town
front
was
not
included
and
the
english
batteries
suffered
greatly
from
want
of
support
by
the
works
on
their
left
on
august
gortschakoff
entered
the
fortress
and
went
round
the
lines
of
defence
upon
which
the
fire
of
the
allies
was
just
then
at
its
height
what
he
saw
might
well
confirm
him
in
his
resolution
to
retreat
there
was
no
longer
either
a
city
or
a
suburb
to
defend
for
both
were
heaps
of
rubbish
and
cinders
the
parapets
of
the
works
dried
in
the
heats
of
summer
and
split
in
huge
fragments
by
the
shot
were
crumbling
into
the
ditches
the
interior
space
was
honeycombed
with
holes
made
by
the
shells
gabions
and
sandbags
could
not
be
procured
to
repair
the
embrasures
which
remained
in
ruins
many
of
the
dismounted
guns
could
no
longer
be
replaced
not
because
there
were
not
plenty
in
the
arsenals
but
because
to
mount
them
by
night
under
the
deadly
fire
of
the
mortars
entailed
such
frightful
sacrifices
of
men
the
defenders
of
the
works
were
packed
in
caves
under
the
parapets
the
gunners
lay
dead
in
heaps
on
the
batteries
the
wounded
could
not
be
removed
by
day
because
the
communications
with
the
rear
were
now
searched
throughout
by
the
fire
of
the
allies
and
so
lay
where
they
fell
in
torment
in
the
sun
beside
the
more
fortunate
slain
on
landing
the
prince
had
passed
the
hospitals
full
to
overflowing
and
the
ambulances
with
the
wounded
crowding
what
had
been
the
squares
there
was
nothing
to
relieve
the
horrible
monotony
of
destruction
and
devastation
except
the
bridge
which
promised
retreat
from
this
misery
and
which
was
approaching
completion
yet
it
was
after
this
visit
that
the
russian
general
changed
his
mind
in
the
direction
of
what
he
had
before
termed
folly
i
am
resolved
he
wrote
to
the
minister
of
war
on
september
to
defend
the
south
side
to
the
last
extremity
for
it
is
the
only
honorable
course
which
remains
to
us
calculating
that
the
daily
loss
of
the
garrison
was
from
eight
hundred
to
nine
hundred
and
that
he
could
bring
thousand
men
from
the
army
outside
to
reenforce
it
by
leaving
only
twenty
thousand
to
guard
the
mackenzie
heights
he
considered
he
might
still
prolong
the
defence
for
a
month
everything
was
against
such
a
cruel
determination
but
he
proceeded
to
execute
it
so
far
as
in
him
lay
yet
it
did
not
rest
with
him
to
determine
the
end
the
cannonade
once
more
reduced
the
malakoff
its
dependencies
and
neighbors
to
absolute
silence
and
enabled
the
french
to
push
their
works
yet
closer
the
soil
between
the
mamelon
and
malakoff
could
be
cut
into
like
a
cheese
and
the
trenches
were
more
easily
made
and
better
constructed
here
than
elsewhere
the
english
trenches
before
the
redan
had
been
stopped
by
solid
rock
the
french
approaches
to
the
little
redan
now
only
forty
yards
from
it
had
also
got
into
soil
so
stony
as
no
longer
to
afford
cover
the
most
advanced
approach
to
the
malakoff
was
separated
from
it
by
only
yards
in
the
soft
soil
the
trenches
might
have
been
pushed
to
the
very
edge
of
the
ditch
but
only
with
great
loss
and
besides
the
facility
of
mining
below
them
would
increase
as
the
distance
lessened
it
was
therefore
deemed
that
the
time
for
assault
had
come
and
it
only
remained
to
determine
the
details
accordingly
a
council
of
war
considered
the
matter
after
the
members
had
delivered
their
opinions
pélissier
expressed
himself
thus
i
too
have
my
plan
but
i
will
not
breathe
it
to
my
pillow
there
is
however
no
need
to
be
so
reticent
with
the
reader
the
french
commander
had
learned
that
the
relief
of
the
troops
in
the
works
before
him
took
place
at
noon
and
that
in
order
to
avoid
the
great
additional
loss
which
would
be
caused
by
introducing
the
new
garrisons
before
the
old
ones
moved
out
the
contrary
course
was
followed
of
marching
out
most
of
the
occupants
before
replacing
them
thus
noon
was
the
time
when
the
malakoff
would
be
found
most
destitute
of
defenders
and
noon
was
to
be
the
hour
of
the
assault
also
another
advantage
was
offered
to
the
french
the
salient
of
the
malakoff
had
been
adapted
to
the
form
of
the
tower
which
it
covered
and
was
therefore
circular
consequently
there
was
a
space
in
it
which
could
not
be
seen
or
fired
on
from
the
flanks
that
was
the
space
upon
which
the
troops
were
to
be
directed
roadways
twenty
yards
wide
were
made
through
the
trenches
and
then
masked
by
gabions
easily
thrown
down
by
which
the
reserves
could
be
brought
up
in
the
shortest
time
the
malakoff
the
curtain
and
the
little
redan
were
each
to
be
attacked
by
a
division
supported
by
a
brigade
and
four
divisions
with
other
troops
were
destined
to
attack
the
central
bastion
and
works
near
it
and
break
thence
by
the
rear
into
the
flagstaff
bastion
but
first
the
cannonade
was
to
be
renewed
it
began
on
september
and
this
time
it
encircled
the
whole
fortress
the
french
batteries
before
the
town
opening
no
less
vigorously
than
the
rest
at
night
a
frigate
in
the
harbor
was
set
on
fire
by
a
shell
and
the
conflagration
for
hours
lighted
up
the
surrounding
scenery
on
the
and
the
went
on

russians
replying
but
feebly
on
the
night
of
the
a
ship
was
set
on
fire
by
a
mortar
and
burned
nearly
all
night
it
contained
a
large
supply
of
spirits
the
blue
flames
from
which
cast
a
lugubrious
light
on
the
ramparts
from
the
harbor
to
the
malakoff
producing
says
todleben
a
painful
impression
on
the
souls
of
the
defenders
of
sebastopol
daylight
on
the
found
the
russian
defences
completely
manned
the
guns
loaded
with
grape
and
the
reserves
brought
close
up
but
the
assault
was
not
yet
begun
and
the
result
of
these
preparations
to
receive
it
was
increased
havoc
in
the
exposed
ranks
of
the
defenders
the
attack
on
the
redan
was
to
be
directed
by
general
codrington
his
division
and
the
second
under
general
markham
were
to
supply
the
column
of
attack
of
which
the
covering
party
the
ladder
party
the
working
party
to
fill
up
the
ditch
and
convert
what
works
we
might
gain
to
our
own
purpose
and
the
main
body
were
to
number
seventeen
hundred
and
the
supports
fifteen
hundred
the
remainder
of
these
two
divisions
numbering
three
thousand
was
to
be
in
reserve
in
the
third
parallel
also
in
the
last
reserve
were
the
third
and
fourth
divisions
no
attack
on
the
redan
would
have
been
undertaken
by
the
english
as
an
isolated
operation
our
compulsory
distance
from
that
work
the
want
of
a
place
of
arms
that
is
to
say
a
covered
space
in
the
advanced
trenches
of
sufficient
extent
to
harbor
large
bodies
of
troops
the
construction
of
which
was
forbidden
by
the
rocky
soil
and
the
still
unsubdued
fire
from
the
ramparts
all
condemned
an
assault
but
it
was
deemed
necessary
as
a
distraction
in
aid
of
the
french
and
it
fulfilled
the
purpose
the
portion
of
codrington
troops
destined
to
head
the
attack
on
the
redan
moved
rapidly
and
steadily
across
the
open
space
though
suffering
much
loss
from
the
heavy
fire
of
grape
case
and
musketry
now
directed
on
them
from
every
available
point
and
those
in
front
passed
with
ease
over
the
battered
rampart
and
entered
the
work
but
the
rest
with
too
strong
a
reminiscence
of
their
mode
of
action
in
the
trenches
lay
down
at
the
edge
of
the
ditch
and
began
firing
alongside
of
the
covering
troops
who
alone
should
have
performed
this
duty
the
supports
also
reached
the
ditch
and
some
of
them
entered
the
work
but
the
great
reserves
in
moving
through
the
inches
toward
the
point
of
issue
were
obstructed
and
discouraged
by
meeting
the
numbers
of
wounded
men
and
their
bearers
who
were
of
necessity
brought
back
by
the
same
narrow
route
a
difficulty
which
also
hindered
some
of
the
french
attacks
colonel
windham
the
leader
of
the
attacking
troops
finding
that
his
messages
for
support
produced
no
result
took
the
step
of
going
back
himself
to
procure
reënforcements
it
was
not
surprising
that
before
he
returned
his
men
also
had
withdrawn
it
is
probably
in
reference
to
this
that
the
said
in
excusing
the
troops
that
they
retired
when
they
found
themselves
without
any
officer
of
rank
they
had
been
overwhelmed
by
the
numbers
which
the
russians
brought
into
the
open
work
and
as
they
hurried
back
they
suffered
not
less
heavily
than
in
their
advance
it
was
unfortunate
for
them
that
the
french
had
spiked
the
guns
in
the
malakoff
instead
of
turning
them
on
the
enemy
moving
into
the
redan
as
they
ought
to
have
done
with
the
immense
increase
of
difficulties
in
making
way
through
the
crowded
trenches
and
renewing
the
attack
against
works
now
fully
armed
and
manned
the
attempt
was
postponed
till
next
day
when
fresh
troops
headed
by
the
highlanders
were
to
renew
it
sir
henry
evelyn
wood
it
may
render
my
narrative
of
the
final
assault
more
readily
comprehensible
if
i
begin
by
saying
that
the
malakoff
being
now
considered
the
key
of
the
russian
position
it
was
determined
that
all
other
attacks
should
be
considered
subsidiary
to
that
which
was
to
be
directed
against
it
general
bosquet
had
command
of
all
the
french
troops
employed
on
the
right
of
the
english
attack
macmahon
division
was
to
assault
the
malakoff
itself
having
de
wimpffen
brigade
with
camou
division
in
reserve
and
with
it
two
battalions
of
zouaves
of
the
guard
on
macmahon
right
la
motterouge
division
composed
of
the
brigades
of
bourbaki
and
picard
was
to
attack
the
curtain
it
was
supported
by
four
regiments
two
of
grenadiers
and
two
of
voltigeurs
of
the
guard
still
farther
north
was
dulac
division
supported
by
marolle
brigade
of
camou
division
and
one
battalion
of
chasseurs
of
the
guard
these
were
to
attack
the
little
redan
pélissier
himself
took
up
his
position
in
the
mamelon
and
to
avoid
giving
warning
to
the
enemy
by
any
system
of
a
general
signal
the
watches
of
the
staff
and
the
generals
were
carefully
compared
in
order
that
the
assault
might
be
begun
at
twelve
this
hour
was
chosen
by
pélissier
in
consequence
of
his
having
ascertained
that
the
troops
on
duty
in
the
russian
trenches
were
relieved
at
that
hour
and
owing
to
the
works
being
cramped
from
the
number
of
traverses
and
blindages
erected
to
cover
their
garrisons
from
fire
it
had
become
the
habit
for
the
old
guard
of
the
works
to
march
out
before
the
relief
marched
in
and
it
was
thus
anticipated
that
at
twelve
the
works
would
be
nearly
empty
this
surmise
proved
to
be
accurate
the
french
had
taken
great
trouble
to
screen
the
concentration
of
their
troops
from
the
sight
of
the
enemy
each
division
had
a
separate
access
to
the
advanced
trenches
in
which
the
storming
parties
were
to
assemble
in
places
where
the
parapets
having
sunk
might
have
disclosed
to
the
view
of
the
enemy
the
troops
moving
into
position
they
had
been
carefully
raised
cuts
had
been
made
through
parapets
to
admit
of
the
supports
moving
forward
in
bodies
and
to
allow
batteries
which
were
stationed
at
the
victoria
redoubt
and
the
old
lancaster
battery
to
pass
through
to
the
front
these
apertures
had
been
filled
up
with
gabions
and
carefully
concealed
so
that
their
position
remained
unknown
to
the
enemy
general
herbillon
still
encamped
on
the
tchernaya
was
directed
to
cause
his
force
less
camou
division
called
up
to
support
la
motterouge
and
dulac
to
stand
to
arms
at
twelve
and
his
command
was
reenforced
by
a
brigade
of
cuirassiers
under
general
de
forton
the
morning
was
dull
and
gloomy
with
a
cold
wind
which
drove
clouds
of
dust
into
the
air
a
little
before
twelve
all
the
french
storming
parties
were
crouching
ready
for
the
order
bosquet
himself
was
in
the
sixth
parallel
macmahon
surrounded
by
his
staff
was
standing
in
the
front
trench
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
no
one
spoke
in
this
group
in
which
the
calm
faces
showed
no
sign
of
the
excitement
visible
in
the
zouaves
on
either
side
of
them
who
though
silent
were
trembling
with
impatience
close
at
hand
there
was
a
corporal
holding
a
little
tricolor
two
minutes
before
twelve
the
word
was
passed
in
an
undertone
ready
and
as
the
hands
indicated
it
was
twelve
on
a
command
from
macmahon
a
shout
arose
of
bugles
and
drums
sounded
the
charge
and
the
zouaves
dashed
straight
at
the
malakoff
macmahon
allowed
two
sections
to
pass
him
and
then
followed
by
his
staff
climbed
over
the
parapet
following
the
advanced
guard
it
placed
one
ladder
by
which
the
general
descended
into
the
ditch
and
was
it
is
said
the
first
up
the
escarp
of
the
work
a
friend
of
mine
described
to
me
how
he
watched
the
tricolor
on
the
parapet
being
carried
slowly
along
thus
indicating
exactly
how
our
allies
in
the
body
of
the
work
were
gaining
ground
the
zouaves
who
crossed
the
ditch
on
the
proper
left
of
the
malakoff
had
some
difficulty
in
climbing
up
from
the
height
and
steepness
of
the
escarp
macmahon
leading
brigade
crossed
the
short
intervening
space
without
a
shot
being
fired
the
enemy
working
parties
and
gunners
who
were
repairing
damages
fought
bravely
with
picks
shovels
and
but
were
eventually
driven
back
the
very
few
russians
in
the
salient
were
completely
surprised
so
much
so
that
some
of
the
superior
officers
were
found
at
dinner
in
an
underground
chamber
of
the
malakoff
and
the
french
without
difficulty
obtained
absolute
possession
of
the
south
end
of
the
work
although
the
enclosure
covered
an
area
of
about
four
hundred
yards
by
one
hundred
fifty
there
was
but
very
little
open
space
within
it
for
behind
the
remnants
of
the
stone
tower
were
rows
of
traverses
stretching
from
side
to
side
of
the
work
behind
these
the
russians
took
post
as
they
came
up
from
their
bombproof
shelters
every
separate
parapet
was
fought
for
hand
to
hand
and
it
was
not
till
vinoy

which
entering
by
the
gervais
battery
got
behind
the
traverses
turning
out
the

that
the
enemy
was
finally
driven
from
this
part
of
the
work
the
leading
brigades
of
motterouge
and
dulac
divisions
headed
by
their
chiefs
seized
the
curtain
and
the
little

the

falling

as

was
nearer
to
it
than
brigade
was
to
the
curtain
once
inside
these
works
from
which
the
russians
were
easily
driven
the
french
pressed
on
to
the
intrenchment
then
being
built
across
the
rear
general
pélissier
now
gave
general
simpson
the
signal
to
attack
the
redan
at
the
same
time
the
french
attacked
the
malakoff
and
there
the
fate
of
sebastopol
was
really
decided
the
possession
of
this
fort
was
strongly
contested
the
russians
bringing
up
the
french
were
also
fired
on
heavily
by
three
steamers
which
circling
round
fired
broadsides
into
them
and
batteries
sent
shells
from
the
north
side
of
the
harbor
into
the
french
support
eventually
after
a
prolonged
struggle
in
which
the
french
captured
four
pol
brigade
was
beaten
back
losing
its
brigadier
and
with
him
fell
the
chief
staff
officer
of
the
division
and
two
colonels
the
russians
followed
up
closely
and
bisson
brigade
which
for
want
of
space
in
the
trenches
had
been
stationed
in
the
careenage
ravine
was
too
far
behind
to
afford
effective
aid
right
being
thus
uncovered
he
also
was
driven
back
although
supported
by
motterouge
other
brigade
after
bourbaki
and
pol
had
been
repulsed
the
voltigeurs
and
grenadiers
of
the
guard
and
marolle
brigade
were
sent
against
the
curtain
and
redan
respectively
these
they
carried
but
were
once
more
expelled
from
the
little
redan
marolle
and
de
pontevès
falling
dead
at
the
head
of
their
brigades
and
mellinet
bisson
and
bourbaki
being
wounded
the
french
still
held
the
curtain
and
bosquet
now
ordered
up
the
two
then
standing
behind
the
victoria
redoubt
they
descended
the
ridge
at
the
trot
unlimbered
in
front
of
the
sixth
parallel
and
coming
into
action
fired
with
great
effect
on
the
russian
infantry
which
offered
a
broad
target
yet
the
batteries
suffered
terribly
the
commanding
officer
souty
was
killed
and
out
of
the
one
hundred
fifty
men
he
brought
down
only
returned
when
the
guns
were
dragged
back
by
hand
because
they
lost
all
their
horses
except
nineteen
bosquet
surrounded
by
several
russian
officers
who
were
prisoners
and
their
guards
was
interrogating
the
captives
when
a
shell
burst
over
them
killing
or
wounding
both
them
and
the
guard
the
general
only
escaping
later
when
leaning
on
the
parapet
watching
the
progress
of
the
fight
he
was
struck
in
the
face
by
a
fragment
of
a
shell
he
had
just
strength
to
send
word
to
general
dulac
to
take
his
place
when
he
fainted
the
struggle
in
and
around
the
malakoff
was
continued
till
three
when
gortschakoff
withdrew
his
troops
from
the
work
which
they
had
defended
with
such
marvellous
endurance
for
eleven
months
the
prize
was
now
won
but
at
heavy
cost
macmahon
division
which
assaulted
with
hundred
bayonets
and
two
hundred
officers
lost
in
killed
and
wounded
just
half
its
strength
soon
after
the
russians
had
been
driven
from
the
salient
of
the
malakoff
the
french
troops
occupying
it
were
fired
on
from
the
lower
part
of
the
old
masonry
tower
which
was
loopholed
and
inside
which
five
officers
and
sixty
russian
soldiers
had
taken
refuge
it
was
impossible
to
dislodge
them
as
the
only
entrance
was
strongly
blocked
on
the
inside
after
a
time
some
gabions
were
collected
and
having
been
placed
in
position
close
to
the
loopholes
were
lighted
but
before
the
defenders
could
be
smoked
out
a
mortar
fired
against
the
door
blew
it
away
and
the
russians
surrendered
the
gabions
burning
fiercely
the
officers
became
alarmed
lest
the
fire
should
be
communicated
to
some
of
the
surrounding
magazines
and
an
attempt
was
made
to
extinguish
the
blazing
fragments
as
this
was
difficult
sappers
were
set
to
work
to
dig
a
trench
and
throw
the
excavated
earth
on
the
fire
while
the
men
were
digging
four
wires
communicating
with
mines
were
found
and
cut
while
the
russian
officers
were
surrendering
a
desperate
struggle
was
carried
on
at
the
far
end
of
the
malakoff
enclosure
the
russians
coming
over
the
parapets
in
three
heavy
columns
khrouleff
the
fighting
general
being
wounded
had
been
replaced
by
general
martinau
the
combatants
fought
hand
to
hand
till
martinau
losing
an
arm
and
his
men
being
out
of
ammunition
gortschakoff
ordered
them
to
give
up
the
struggle
and
fall
back
between
three
and
four
a
magazine
blew
up
near
the
point
where
the
curtain
joined
the
malakoff
and
the
division
at
once
ran
back
to
the
french
advanced
trenches
this
occurred
at
a
moment
when
general
la
motterouge
was
wounded
but
his
men
were
rallied
and
got
back
into
position
ere
the
smoke
and
dust
of
the
explosion
cleared
away
the
flag
of
the
regiment
was
buried
so
deep
that
it
was
not
found
till
next
day
when
it
was
recovered
still
grasped
tightly
in
the
hands
of
the
lifeless
officer
who
was
carrying
it
when
the
explosion
took
place
when
the
russians
withdrew
general
macmahon
contemplating
the
possibility
of
further
explosions
from
undiscovered
mines
in
order
to
minimize
possible
loss
of
life
sent
back
the
brigade
under
colonel
decaen
whom
he
ordered
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
and
if
brigade
should
be
blown
into
the
air
to
come
forward
immediately
and
replace
it
then
turning
to
general
vinoy
macmahon
observed
it
is
possible
general
that
your
brigade
will
be
blown
up
but
decaen
will
replace
you
immediately
so
we
shall
still
hold
our
position
macmahon
himself
remained
in
the
malakoff
with
vinoy
brigade
during
the
afternoon
it
was
reported
to
general
pélissier
that
large
numbers
of
russian
troops
were
crossing
by
the
floating
bridge
to
the
north
side
of
the
harbor
but
the
allies
did
not
yet
feel
confident
that
the
end
had
quite
come
about
midnight
one
of
the
maritime
forts
was
blown
up
and
explosions
continued
at
intervals
throughout
the
night
fires
bursting
out
wherever
any
inflammable
substance
remained
at
on
the
corporal
ross
royal
engineers
who
was
employed
in
the
advanced
sap
being
struck
by
the
unusual
silence
within
the
redan
crept
across
the
ditch
and
climbing
over
the
parapet
found
that
the
enemy
had
evacuated
the
work
at
daylight
all
the
russian
fleet
except
the
vladimir
had
disappeared
under
water
and
the
last
of
this
heroic
garrison
was
seen
forming
up
on
the
north
side
of
the
floating
bridge
which
was
then
cut
leaving
on
the
southern
side
two
hundred
or
three
hundred
men
who
had
remained
behind
setting
fire
to
the
houses
this
was
the
last
of
the
active
operations
gortschakoff
withdrew
his
troops
and
placing
the
cavalry
on
the
belbeck
extended
the
infantry
along
the
mackenzie
farm
heights
position
which
he
proceeded
to
fortify
the
allies
were
now
in
possession
of
the
bloodstained
ruins
of
sebastopol
and
the
last
of
the
black
sea
fleet
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
harbor
perhaps
it
was
well
that
peace
ensued
although
we
might
have
dislodged
the
russians
from
their
position
on
the
heights
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
obtain
any
further
material
advantage
in
the
crimea
the
indian
mutiny
talboys
wheeler
from
the
time
when
warren
hastings
the
first
english
of
india
was
sent
to
rule
there
the
british
power
in
that
country
grew
steadily
and
many
annexations
were
made
to
the
territory
under
its
control
there
were
frequent
wars
with
the
french
rivals
in
india
and
with
the
natives
in
different
provinces
that
one
after
another
were
absorbed
into
the
british
possessions
the
first
serious
menace
against
this
growing
power
appeared
in
a
native
movement
the
culmination
of
which
is
known
as
the
indian
or
sepoy
mutiny
the
causes
of
this
rising
are
traced
to
distrust
and
hatred
of
the
british
rulers
feelings
that
caused
a
ferment
among
the
hindus
and
mahometans
of
india
who
suspected
a
design
for
suppressing
their
religions
the
natives
also
became
alarmed
at
the
introduction
of
western
ideas
and
improvements
new
methods
of
education
the
the
telegraph
portending
to
the
indian
peoples
the
substitution
of
a
foreign
civilization
for
their
own
the
truth
is
that
in
attempting
to
abolish
suttee
and
other
ancient
native
customs
and
to
introduce
more
enlightened
practices
the
british
government
was
acting
in
the
interest
of
general
humanity
the
immediate
provocation
of
the
great
mutiny
among
the
sepoys
or
native
troops
in
the
british
service
is
well
shown
and
the
entire
story
of
the
revolt
is
equally
well
told
by
wheeler
this
author
while
a
secretary
to
the
government
of
india
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
enjoyed
peculiar
advantages
for
study
and
research
these
advantages
he
turned
to
account
by
writing
an
authoritative
and
interesting
history
of
the
land
of
his
official
residence
early
in
the
year
it
is
said
there
were
rumors
of
a
coming
danger
to
british
rule
in
india
in
some
parts
of
the
country
or
cakes
were
circulated
in
a
mysterious
manner
from
village
to
village
footnote
the
form
of
the
cake
conveyed
information
that
an
insurrection
was
in
preparation
an
old
custom
understood
by
the
ed
prophecies
were
also
rife
that
in
the
east
india
company
rule
would
come
to
an
end
lord
canning
has
been
blamed
for
not
taking
alarm
at
these
proceedings
but
something
of
the
kind
always
had
been
going
on
in
india
cakes
of
cocoanuts
are
given
away
in
solemn
fashion
and
as
the
villagers
were
afraid
to
keep
them
or
eat
them
the
circulation
went
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
then
again
holy
men
and
prophets
have
always
been
common
in
india
they
foretell
pestilence
and
famine
the
downfall
of
british
rule
or
the
destruction
of
the
whole
world
they
are
often
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
supernatural
powers
and
to
be
impervious
to
bullets
but
these
phenomena
invariably
disappear
whenever
they
come
in
contact
with
europeans
especially
as
all
such
characters
are
liable
to
be
treated
as
vagrants
without
visible
means
of
subsistence
one
dangerous
story
however
got
abroad
in
the
early
part
of
which
ought
to
have
been
stopped
at
once
and
for
which
the
military
authorities
were
wholly
and
solely
to
blame
the
enfield
rifle
was
being
introduced
it
required
new
cartridges
which
in
england
were
greased
with
the
fat
of
beef
or
pork
the
military
authorities
in
india
with
strange
indifference
to
the
prejudices
of
sepoys
ordered
the
cartridges
to
be
prepared
at
calcutta
in
like
manner
forgetting
that
the
fat
of
pigs
was
hateful
to
the
mahometans
while
the
fat
of
cows
was
still
more
horrible
in
the
eyes
of
the
hindus
the
excitement
began
at
barrackpur
sixteen
miles
from
calcutta
at
this
station
there
were
four
regiments
of
sepoys
and
no
europeans
except
the
regimental
officers
one
day
a
native
known
as
a
lascar
asked
a
brahmin
sepoy
for
a
drink
of
water
from
his
brass
pot
the
brahmin
refused
as
it
would
defile
his
pot
the
lascar
retorted
that
the
brahmin
was
already
defiled
by
biting
cartridges
which
had
been
greased
with
cow
fat
this
vindictive
taunt
was
based
on
truth
lascars
had
been
employed
at
calcutta
in
preparing
the
new
cartridges
and
the
man
was
possibly
one
of
them
the
taunt
created
a
wild
panic
at
barrackpur
strange
to
say
however
none
of
the
new
cartridges
had
been
issued
to
the
sepoys
and
had
this
been
promptly
explained
to
the
men
and
the
sepoys
left
to
grease
their
own
cartridges
the
alarm
might
have
died
out
but
the
explanation
was
delayed
until
the
whole
of
the
bengal
army
was
smitten
with
the
groundless
fear
and
then
when
it
was
too
late
the
authorities
protested
too
much
and
the
sepoys
refused
to
believe
them
the
sepoys
had
proved
themselves
brave
under
fire
and
loyal
to
their
salt
in
sharp
extremities
but
they
are
the
most
credulous
and
excitable
soldiery
in
the
world
they
regarded
steam
and
electricity
as
so
much
magic
and
they
fully
believed
that
the
british
government
was
binding
india
with
chains
when
it
was
only
laying
down
railway
lines
and
telegraph
wires
the
enfield
rifle
was
a
new
mystery
and
the
busy
brains
of
the
sepoys
were
soon
at
work
to
divine
the
motive
of
the
english
in
greasing
cartridges
with
cow
fat
they
had
always
taken
to
themselves
the
sole
credit
of
having
conquered
india
for
the
company
and
they
now
imagined
that
the
english
wanted
them
to
conquer
persia
and
china
accordingly
they
suspected
that
lord
canning
was
going
to
make
them
as
strong
as
europeans
by
destroying
caste
forcing
them
to
become
christians
and
making
them
eat
beef
and
drink
beer
the
story
of
the
greased
cartridges
with
all
its
absurd
embellishments
ran
up
the
ganges
and
jumna
to
benares
allahabad
agra
delhi
and
the
great
cantonment
at
meerut
while
another
current
of
lies
ran
back
again
from
meerut
to
barrackpur
it
was
noised
abroad
that
the
bones
of
cows
and
pigs
had
been
ground
into
powder
and
thrown
into
wells
and
mingled
with
flour
and
butter
in
order
to
destroy
the
caste
of
the
masses
and
convert
them
to
christianity
for
a
brief
interval
it
was
hoped
that
the
disaffection
was
suppressed
excitement
manifested
itself
in
various
ways
at
different
stations
throughout
the
length
of
hindustan
and
the
punjab
at
benares
lucknow
agra
ambala
and
sealkote
in
some
stations
there
were
incendiary
fires
in
others
the
sepoys
were
wanting
in
their
usual
respect
to
their
european
officers
but
it
was
believed
that
the
storm
was
spending
itself
and
that
the
dark
clouds
were
passing
away
suddenly
on
may
there
was
an
explosion
at
lucknow
a
regiment
of
oudh
irregular
infantry
previously
in
the
service
of
the
mogul
broke
out
in
mutiny
and
began
to
threaten
their
european
officers
sir
henry
lawrence
the
new
chief
commissioner
had
a
european
regiment
at
his
disposal
namely
the
foot
that
same
evening
he
ordered
out
the
regiment
and
a
battery
of
eight
guns
manned
by
europeans
together
with
four
sepoy
regiments
three
of
infantry
and
one
of
cavalry
with
this
force
he
proceeded
to
the
lines
of
the
mutineers
about
seven
miles
off
the
oudh
irregulars
were
taken
by
surprise
they
saw
infantry
and
cavalry
on
either
side
and
the
european
guns
in
front
they
were
ordered
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
they
obeyed
at
this
moment
the
artillery
lighted
their
port
fires
the
mutineers
were
seized
with
a
panic
and
rushed
away
in
the
darkness
but
the
leaders
and
most
of
their
followers
were
pursued
and
arrested
by
the
native
infantry
and
cavalry
and
confined
pending
trial
subsequently
it
transpired
that
the
native
regiments
sympathized
with
the
mutineers
and
would
have
shown
it
but
for
their
dread
of
sir
henry
lawrence
and
the
europeans
the
energetic
action
of
lawrence
sufficed
to
maintain
order
for
another
month
in
oudh
meanwhile
the
native
infantry
was
disbanded
at
barrackpur
and
again
it
was
hoped
that
the
disaffection
was
stayed
the
demon
of
mutiny
was
only
scotched
within
a
week
of
the
outbreak
at
lucknow
the
great
military
station
of
meerut
was
in
a
blaze
meerut
was
only
forty
miles
from
delhi
and
the
largest
cantonment
in
india
there
were
three
regiments
of
sepoys
two
of
infantry
and
one
of
cavalry
but
there
were
enough
europeans
to
scatter
four
times
the
number
namely
a
battalion
of
the
sixtieth
rifles
a
regiment
of
dragoon
guards
known
as
the
carabineers
two
troops
of
and
a
light
in
spite
of
the
presence
of
europeans
there
were
more
indications
of
excitement
at
meerut
than
at
any
other
station
in
the
northwest
at
meerut
the
story
of
the
greased
cartridges
had
been
capped
by
the
story
of
the
bonedust
and
there
were
the
same
kind
of
incendiary
fires
the
same
lack
of
respect
toward
european
officers
and
the
same
whispered
resolve
not
to
touch
the
cartridges
as
at
barrackpur
the
station
was
commanded
by
general
hewitt
whose
advancing
years
unfitted
him
to
cope
with
the
storm
which
was
bursting
upon
hindustan
the
regiment
of
sepoy
cavalry
at
meerut
was
strongly
suspected
of
disaffection
accordingly
it
was
resolved
to
put
the
men
to
the
test
on
may
it
was
paraded
in
the
presence
of
the
european
force
and
cartridges
were
served
out
not
the
greased
abominations
from
calcutta
but
the
old
ones
which
had
been
used
times
innumerable
by
the
sepoys
and
their
fathers
but
the
men
were
terrified
and
obstinate
and
stood
out
and
refused
to
take
the
cartridges
the
offenders
were
at
once
arrested
and
tried
by
a
of
native
officers
they
were
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
various
periods
of
imprisonment
but
recommended
for
mercy
general
hewitt
saw
no
grounds
for
mercy
excepting
in
the
case
of
eleven
young
troopers
and
on
saturday
may
the
sentences
were
carried
out
the
men
were
brought
on
parade
stripped
of
their
uniforms
and
loaded
with
irons
they
implored
the
general
for
mercy
and
finding
it
hopeless
began
to
reproach
their
comrades
but
no
one
dared
to
strike
a
blow
in
the
presence
of
loaded
cannon
and
rifles
at
last
the
prisoners
were
carried
off
and
placed
in
a
jail
not
under
european
soldiers
but
a
native
guard
the
military
authorities
at
meerut
seem
to
have
been
under
a
spell
the
next
day
was
sunday
may
and
the
hot
sun
rose
with
its
usual
glare
in
the
indian
sky
the
european
barracks
were
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
native
lines
and
the
intervening
space
was
covered
with
shops
and
houses
surrounded
by
trees
and
gardens
consequently
the
europeans
in
the
barracks
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
native
quarter
meanwhile
there
were
commotions
in
the
sepoy
lines
and
neighboring
bazaars
the
sepoys
were
taunted
by
the
loose
women
of
the
place
with
permitting
their
comrades
to
be
imprisoned
and
fettered
at
the
same
time
they
were
smitten
with
a
mad
fear
that
the
european
soldiers
were
to
be
let
loose
upon
them
the
europeans
at
meerut
saw
and
heard
nothing
nothing
was
noted
on
that
sunday
morning
except
the
absence
of
native
servants
from
many
of
the
houses
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
accidental
morning
service
was
followed
by
the
midday
heats
and
at
five
in
the
afternoon
the
europeans
were
again
preparing
for
church
suddenly
there
was
an
alarm
of
fire
followed
by
a
volley
of
musketry
discordant
yells
the
clattering
of
cavalry
and
the
bugle
sounding
an
alarm
the
sepoys
had
worked
themselves
up
to
a
frenzy
of
excitement
the
prisoners
were
released
with
a
host
of
jailbirds
the
native
infantry
joined
the
native
cavalry
and
the
colonel
of
one
of
the
regiments
was
shot
by
the
sepoys
of
the
other
inspired
by
a
wild
fear
and
fury
the
sepoys
ran
about
murdering
or
wounding
every
european
they
met
and
setting
houses
on
fire
amid
deafening
shouts
and
uproar
meanwhile
there
were
fatal
delays
in
turning
out
the
europeans
the
rifles
were
paraded
for
church
and
time
was
lost
in
getting
arms
and
serving
out
ball
cartridges
the
carabineers
were
absurdly
put
through
a
and
then
lost
their
way
among
the
shops
and
gardens
meanwhile
european
officers
were
being
butchered
by
the
infuriated
sepoys
men
and
women
were
fired
at
or
sabred
while
hurrying
back
in
a
panic
from
church
flaming
houses
and
crashing
timbers
were
filling
all
hearts
with
terror
and
the
shades
of
evening
were
falling
upon
the
general
havoc
and
turmoil
when
the
europeans
reached
the
native
lines
and
found
that
the
sepoys
had
gone
no
one
knew
whither
the
truth
was
soon
told
the
mutiny
had
become
a
revolt
the
sepoys
were
on
the
way
to
delhi
to
proclaim
the
old
mogul
as
sovereign
of
hindustan
and
there
was
no
gillespie
to
gallop
after
them
and
crush
the
revolt
at
its
outset
as
had
been
done
at
vellore
half
a
century
before
one
thing
however
was
done
there
were
no
european
regiments
at
delhi
nothing
but
three
regiments
of
sepoy
infantry
and
a
battery
of
native
artillery
the
station
was
commanded
by
brigadier
graves
and
there
were
no
europeans
under
his
orders
excepting
the
officers
and
sergeants
attached
to
the
three
native
corps
accordingly
telegrams
were
sent
to
brigadier
graves
to
tell
him
that
the
mutineers
were
on
their
way
to
delhi
monday
at
delhi
was
worse
than
the
sunday
at
meerut
the
british
cantonment
was
situated
on
a
rising
ground
about
two
miles
from
the
city
which
was
known
as
the
ridge
the
great
magazine
containing
immense
stores
of
ammunition
was
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
city
one
of
the
three
sepoy
regiments
was
on
duty
in
the
city
the
other
two
remained
in
the
cantonment
on
the
ridge
the
approach
to
delhi
from
meerut
was
defended
by
the
little
river
hindun
which
was
spanned
by
a
small
bridge
it
was
proposed
to
procure
two
cannon
from
the
magazine
and
place
them
on
the
bridge
but
before
this
could
be
done
the
rebel
cavalry
from
meerut
were
seen
crossing
the
river
and
were
subsequently
followed
by
the
rebel
infantry
the
magazine
remained
in
charge
of
lieutenant
willoughby
of
the
bengal
artillery
he
was
associated
with
two
other
officers
and
six
conductors
and
sergeants
the
rest
of
the
establishment
was
composed
entirely
of
natives
brigadier
graves
did
his
best
to
protect
the
city
and
cantonment
until
the
arrival
of
the
expected
europeans
from
meerut
indeed
throughout
the
morning
and
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
everyone
in
delhi
was
expecting
the
arrival
of
the
europeans
brigadier
graves
ordered
all
the
residents
including
women
and
children
to
repair
to
flagstaff
tower
a
round
building
of
solid
brickwork
at
some
distance
from
the
city
late
detachments
of
sepoys
were
sent
from
the
ridge
to
the
cashmere
gate
under
the
command
of
their
european
officers
to
help
the
sepoys
on
duty
to
maintain
order
in
the
city
presently
the
rebel
troops
from
meerut
came
up
accompanied
by
the
insurgent
rabble
of
delhi
the
english
officers
prepared
to
charge
them
and
gave
the
order
to
fire
but
some
of
the
sepoys
refused
to
obey
or
only
fired
into
the
air
the
english
officers
held
on
expecting
the
european
soldiers
from
meerut
the
sepoys
hesitated
to
join
the
rebels
out
of
dread
of
the
coming
europeans
at
last
the
delhi
sepoys
threw
in
their
lot
with
the
rebels
and
shot
down
their
own
officers
the
revolt
spread
throughout
the
whole
city
and
the
suspense
of
the
english
on
the
ridge
and
at
flagstaff
tower
began
to
give
way
to
the
agony
of
despair
suddenly
at
four
in
the
afternoon
a
column
of
white
smoke
arose
from
the
city
and
an
explosion
was
heard
far
and
wide
willoughby
and
his
eight
associates
had
held
out
to
the
last
waiting
and
hoping
for
the
coming
of
the
europeans
they
had
closed
and
barricaded
the
gates
of
the
magazine
and
they
had
posted
at
the
gates
loaded
with
double
charges
of
grape
and
laid
a
train
to
the
messengers
came
in
the
name
of
bahadur
shah
to
demand
the
surrender
of
the
magazine
but
no
answer
was
returned
the
enemy
approached
and
raised
ladders
against
the
walls
while
the
native
establishment
escaped
over
some
sheds
and
joined
the
rebels
at
this
crisis
the
guns
opened
fire
round
after
round
of
grape
made
fearful
havoc
on
the
mass
of
humanity
that
was
heaving
and
surging
round
the
gates
at
last
the
ammunition
was
exhausted
no
one
could
leave
the
guns
to
bring
up
more
shot
the
mutineers
were
pouring
in
on
all
sides
lieutenant
willoughby
gave
the
signal
conductor
scully
fired
the
train
and
with
one
tremendous
upheaval
the
magazine
was
blown
into
the
air
together
with
fifteen
hundred
rebels
not
one
of
the
gallant
nine
had
expected
to
escape
willoughby
and
three
others
got
away
scorched
maimed
bruised
and
nearly
insensible
but
scully
and
his
comrades
were
never
seen
again
willoughby
died
of
his
injuries
six
weeks
afterward
while
india
and
europe
were
ringing
with
his
name
still
more
terrible
and
treacherous
were
the
tragedies
enacted
at
cawnpore
a
city
situated
on
the
ganges
about
miles
to
the
southwest
of
lucknow
cawnpore
had
been
in
the
possession
of
the
english
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
for
many
years
was
one
of
the
most
important
military
stations
in
india
but
the
extension
of
the
british
empire
over
the
punjab
had
diminished
the
importance
of
cawnpore
and
the
last
european
regiment
quartered
there
had
been
removed
to
the
northwest
at
the
close
of
the
previous
year
in
may
there
were
four
native
regiments
at
cawnpore
numbering
hundred
sepoys
there
were
no
europeans
whatever
excepting
the
regimental
officers
and
artillerymen
to
these
were
added
small
detachments
of
european
soldiers
which
had
been
sent
in
the
hour
of
peril
from
lucknow
and
benares
during
the
month
of
may
the
station
of
cawnpore
was
commanded
by
sir
hugh
wheeler
a
distinguished
general
in
the
company
service
who
was
verging
on
his
seventieth
year
he
had
spent
years
in
india
and
had
served
only
with
native
troops
he
must
have
known
the
sepoys
better
than
any
other
european
in
india
he
had
led
them
against
their
own
countrymen
under
lord
lake
against
foreigners
during
the
afghan
war
and
against
sikhs
during
both
campaigns
in
the
punjab
the
news
of
the
revolt
at
meerut
threw
the
sepoys
into
a
ferment
at
every
military
station
in
hindustan
rumors
of
mutiny
or
coming
mutiny
formed
almost
the
only
topic
of
conversation
yet
in
nearly
every
sepoy
regiment
the
european
officers
put
faith
in
their
men
and
fondly
believed
that
though
the
rest
of
the
army
might
revolt
yet
their
own
corps
would
prove
faithful
such
was
eminently
the
case
at
cawnpore
yet
general
wheeler
seems
to
have
known
better
while
the
european
officers
continued
to
sleep
every
night
in
the
sepoy
lines
the
veteran
made
his
preparations
for
meeting
the
coming
storm
european
combatants
were
very
few
at
cawnpore
but
european
were
very
heavy
besides
the
wives
and
families
of
the
regimental
officers
of
the
sepoy
regiments
there
was
a
large
european
mercantile
community
moreover
while
the
foot
was
quartered
at
lucknow
the
wives
families
and
invalids
of
the
regiment
were
living
at
cawnpore
it
was
thus
necessary
to
secure
a
place
of
refuge
for
this
miscellaneous
multitude
of
europeans
in
the
event
of
a
rising
of
the
sepoys
accordingly
general
wheeler
pitched
upon
some
old
barracks
which
had
once
belonged
to
a
european
regiment
and
he
ordered
earthworks
to
be
thrown
up
and
supplies
of
all
kinds
to
be
stored
in
order
to
stand
a
siege
unfortunately
there
was
fatal
neglect
somewhere
for
when
the
crisis
came
the
defences
were
found
to
be
worthless
while
the
supplies
were
insufficient
for
the
besieged
all
this
while
the
adopted
son
of
the
former
footnote
formerly
a
chief
of
the
ed
was
living
at
bithoor
about
six
miles
from
cawnpore
his
real
name
was
dandhu
panth
but
he
is
better
known
as
nana
sahib
the
british
government
had
refused
to
award
him
the
absurd
life
pension
of
eighty
thousand
pounds
sterling
which
had
been
granted
to
his
nominal
father
but
he
had
inherited
at
least
half
a
million
from
the
and
he
was
allowed
to
keep
six
guns
to
entertain
as
many
followers
as
he
pleased
and
to
live
in
half
royal
state
in
a
castellated
palace
at
bithoor
he
continued
to
nurse
his
grievance
with
all
the
pertinacity
of
a
mahratta
but
at
the
same
time
he
professed
a
great
love
for
european
society
and
was
profuse
in
his
hospitalities
to
english
officers
he
was
popularly
known
as
the
raja
of
bithoor
when
the
news
arrived
of
the
revolt
at
meerut
on
may
nana
was
loud
in
his
professions
of
attachment
to
the
english
he
engaged
to
organize
fifteen
hundred
fighting
men
to
act
against
the
sepoys
in
the
event
of
an
outbreak
on
may
there
was
an
alarm
european
women
and
families
with
all
european
were
removed
into
the
barracks
and
general
wheeler
actually
accepted
from
nana
the
help
of
two
hundred
mahrattas
and
two
guns
to
guard
the
treasury
the
alarm
however
soon
blew
over
and
nana
took
up
his
abode
at
the
civil
station
of
cawnpore
as
a
proof
of
the
sincerity
of
his
professions
at
last
on
the
night
of
june
the
sepoy
regiments
at
cawnpore
broke
out
in
mutiny
they
were
driven
to
action
by
the
same
mad
terror
which
had
been
manifested
elsewhere
they
cared
nothing
for
the
mogul
nothing
for
the
pageant
king
at
delhi
but
they
had
been
by
extravagant
stories
of
coming
destruction
it
was
whispered
among
them
that
the
was
undermined
with
powder
and
that
hindus
and
mahometans
were
to
be
assembled
on
a
given
day
and
blown
into
the
air
intoxicated
with
fear
and
they
rushed
out
in
the
darkness
yelling
shooting
and
burning
according
to
their
wont
and
when
their
excitement
was
somewhat
spent
they
marched
off
toward
delhi
sir
hugh
wheeler
could
do
nothing
he
might
have
retreated
with
the
whole
body
of
europeans
from
cawnpore
to
allahabad
but
there
had
been
a
mutiny
at
allahabad
and
moreover
he
had
no
means
of
transport
subsequently
he
heard
that
the
mutineers
had
reached
the
first
stage
on
the
road
to
delhi
and
consequently
he
saw
no
ground
for
alarm
meanwhile
the
brain
of
nana
sahib
had
been
turned
by
wild
dreams
of
vengeance
and
sovereignty
he
thought
not
only
to
wreak
his
malice
upon
the
english
but
to
restore
the
extinct
mahratta
empire
and
reign
over
hindustan
as
the
representative
of
the
forgotten
peshwas
the
stampede
of
the
sepoys
to
delhi
was
fatal
to
his
mad
ambition
he
overtook
the
mutineers
dazzled
them
with
fables
of
the
treasures
in
intrenchment
and
brought
them
back
to
cawnpore
to
carry
out
his
vindictive
and
visionary
schemes
at
early
morning
on
saturday
june
general
wheeler
received
from
nana
a
letter
announcing
that
he
was
about
to
attack
the
intrenchment
the
veteran
was
taken
by
surprise
but
at
once
ordered
all
the
european
officers
to
join
the
party
in
the
barracks
and
prepare
for
the
defence
but
the
mutineers
were
in
no
hurry
for
the
advance
they
preferred
booty
to
battle
and
turned
aside
to
plunder
the
cantonment
and
city
murdering
every
christian
that
came
in
their
way
not
sparing
the
houses
of
their
own
countrymen
they
appropriated
all
the
cannon
and
ammunition
in
the
magazine
by
way
of
preparation
for
the
siege
but
some
were
wise
enough
to
desert
the
rebel
army
and
steal
to
their
homes
with
their
spoil
about
noon
the
main
body
of
the
mutineers
swelled
by
the
numerous
retainers
of
nana
got
their
guns
into
position
and
opened
fire
on
the
intrenchment
for
nineteen
days
from
june
to
the
the
garrison
struggled
manfully
against
a
raking
fire
and
fearful
odds
amid
scenes
of
suffering
and
bloodshed
that
can
not
be
recalled
without
a
shudder
it
was
the
height
of
the
hot
weather
in
hindustan
a
blazing
sun
was
burning
over
the
heads
of
the
besieged
and
to
add
to
their
misery
one
of
the
barracks
containing
the
sick
and
wounded
was
destroyed
by
fire
the
besiegers
however
in
spite
of
their
overwhelming
numbers
were
utterly
unable
to
carry
the
intrenchment
by
storm
but
continued
to
pour
in
a
raking
fire
meanwhile
the
garrison
was
starving
from
want
of
provisions
and
hampered
by
a
multitude
of
helpless
women
and
children
indeed
but
for
the
latter
contingency
the
gallant
band
would
have
rushed
out
of
the
intrenchment
and
cut
a
way
through
the
mob
of
sepoys
or
perished
in
the
attempt
as
it
was
they
could
only
fight
on
waiting
for
reinforcements
that
never
came
until
fever
sunstroke
hunger
madness
or
the
enemy
fire
delivered
them
from
their
suffering
and
despair
on
june
a
woman
brought
a
slip
of
writing
from
nana
promising
to
give
a
safe
passage
to
allahabad
to
all
who
were
willing
to
lay
down
their
arms
had
there
been
no
women
or
children
the
garrison
would
never
have
dreamed
of
surrender
the
massacre
at
patna
a
century
before
had
taught
a
lesson
to
englishmen
which
ought
never
to
have
been
forgotten
as
it
was
there
were
some
who
wished
to
fight
on
till
the
bitter
end
but
the
majority
saw
that
there
was
no
hope
for
the
women
or
the
children
the
sick
or
the
wounded
except
by
accepting
the
proffered
terms
accordingly
the
pride
of
englishmen
gave
way
and
an
armistice
was
proclaimed
next
morning
the
terms
were
negotiated
the
english
garrison
were
to
surrender
their
position
their
guns
and
their
treasure
but
to
march
out
with
their
arms
and
with
sixty
rounds
of
ammunition
in
the
pouch
of
every
man
nana
sahib
on
his
part
was
to
afford
a
to
the
about
a
mile
off
to
provide
carriage
for
the
conveyance
of
the
women
and
children
the
sick
and
the
wounded
and
to
furnish
boats
for
carrying
the
whole
party
numbering
some
four
hundred
fifty
individuals
down
the
river
ganges
to
allahabad
nana
accepted
the
terms
but
demanded
the
evacuation
of
the
intrenchment
that
very
night
general
wheeler
protested
against
this
proviso
nana
began
to
bully
and
to
threaten
that
he
would
open
fire
he
was
told
that
he
might
carry
the
intrenchment
if
he
could
but
that
the
english
had
enough
powder
left
to
blow
both
armies
into
the
air
accordingly
nana
agreed
to
wait
until
the
morrow
at
early
morning
on
june
the
garrison
began
to
move
from
the
intrenchment
to
the
place
of
embarkation
the
men
marched
on
foot
the
women
and
children
were
carried
on
elephants
and
in
while
the
wounded
were
mostly
conveyed
in
palanquins
forty
boats
with
thatched
roofs
known
as
were
moored
in
shallow
water
at
a
little
distance
from
the
bank
and
the
crowd
of
fugitives
were
forced
to
wade
through
the
river
to
the
boats
by
nine
the
whole
four
hundred
fifty
were
huddled
on
board
and
the
boats
prepared
to
leave
cawnpore
suddenly
a
bugle
was
sounded
and
a
murderous
fire
of
and
musketry
was
opened
upon
the
wretched
passengers
from
both
sides
of
the
river
at
the
same
time
the
thatching
of
many
of
the
budgerows
was
found
to
be
on
fire
and
the
flames
began
to
spread
from
boat
to
boat
numbers
were
murdered
in
the
river
but
at
last
the
firing
ceased
a
few
escaped
down
the
river
but
only
four
men
survived
to
tell
the
story
of
the
massacre
a
mass
of
fugitives
were
dragged
ashore
the
women
and
children
to
the
number
of
a
hundred
were
carried
off
and
lodged
in
a
house
near
the
headquarters
of
nana
the
men
were
ordered
to
immediate
execution
one
of
them
had
preserved
a
and
was
permitted
to
read
a
few
sentences
of
the
liturgy
to
his
doomed
companions
then
the
fatal
order
was
given
the
sepoys
poured
in
a
volley
of
musketry
and
all
was
over
on
july
nana
sahib
went
off
to
his
palace
at
bithoor
and
was
proclaimed
peshwa
he
took
his
seat
upon
the
throne
and
was
installed
with
all
the
ceremonies
of
sovereignty
while
the
cannon
roared
out
a
salute
in
his
honor
at
night
the
whole
place
was
illuminated
and
the
hours
of
darkness
were
wiled
away
with
feasting
and
fireworks
but
his
triumph
was
the
mahometans
were
plotting
against
him
at
cawnpore
the
people
were
leaving
the
city
to
escape
the
coming
storm
and
were
taking
refuge
in
the
villages
english
reënforcements
were
at
last
coming
up
from
allahabad
while
the
greedy
sepoys
were
clamoring
for
money
and
gold
bangles
accordingly
nana
hastened
back
to
cawnpore
and
scattered
wealth
with
a
lavish
hand
and
sought
to
hide
his
fears
by
boastful
proclamations
and
to
drown
his
anxieties
in
drink
and
debauchery
within
a
few
days
more
the
number
of
helpless
prisoners
was
increased
to
two
hundred
there
had
been
a
mutiny
at
fathigarh
higher
up
the
river
and
the
fugitives
had
fled
in
boats
to
cawnpore
a
distance
of
eighty
miles
they
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
and
were
all
taken
prisoners
by
the
rebels
and
brought
on
shore
the
men
were
all
butchered
in
the
presence
of
nana
the
women
and
children
eighty
in
number
were
sent
to
join
the
wretched
sufferers
in
the
house
near
nana
headquarters
meanwhile
colonel
neill
commanding
the
madras
fusiliers
was
pushing
up
from
calcutta
he
was
bent
on
the
relief
of
cawnpore
and
lucknow
but
was
delayed
on
the
way
by
the
mutinies
at
benares
and
allahabad
in
july
he
was
joined
at
allahabad
by
a
column
under
general
havelock
who
was
destined
within
a
few
weeks
to
win
a
lasting
name
in
history
general
havelock
was
a
queen
officer
of
forty
years
standing
but
he
had
seen
more
service
in
india
than
perhaps
any
other
officer
in
her
majesty
army
he
had
fought
in
the
first
burma
war
the
kabul
war
the
gwalior
campaign
of
and
the
punjab
campaign
of
he
was
a
pale
thin
thoughtful
man
small
in
stature
but
burning
with
the
aspirations
of
a
puritan
hero
religion
was
the
ruling
principle
of
his
life
and
military
glory
was
his
master
passion
he
had
just
returned
to
india
after
commanding
a
division
in
the
persian
war
abstemious
to
a
fault
he
was
able
in
spite
of
his
advancing
years
to
bear
up
against
the
heat
and
rain
of
hindustan
during
the
deadliest
season
of
the
year
on
july
general
havelock
left
allahabad
for
cawnpore
the
force
at
his
disposal
did
not
exceed
two
thousand
men
europeans
and
sikhs
he
had
heard
of
the
massacre
at
cawnpore
on
june
and
burned
to
avenge
it
on
july
he
defeated
a
large
force
of
mutineers
and
mahrattas
at
fathipur
on
the
he
inflicted
two
more
defeats
on
the
enemy
havelock
was
now
within
miles
of
cawnpore
and
he
halted
his
men
to
rest
for
the
night
but
news
arrived
that
the
women
and
children
were
still
alive
at
cawnpore
and
that
nana
had
taken
the
field
with
a
large
force
to
oppose
his
advance
accordingly
havelock
marched
fourteen
miles
that
same
night
and
on
the
following
morning
within
eight
miles
of
cawnpore
the
troops
bivouacked
beneath
some
trees
on
that
same
night
july
the
crowning
atrocity
was
committed
at
cawnpore
the
rebels
who
had
been
defeated
by
havelock
returned
to
nana
with
the
tidings
of
their
disaster
in
revenge
nana
ordered
the
slaughter
of
the
two
hundred
women
and
children
the
poor
victims
were
literally
hacked
to
death
or
almost
to
death
with
swords
bayonets
knives
and
axús
next
morning
the
bleeding
remains
of
dead
and
dying
were
dragged
to
a
neighboring
well
and
thrown
in
at
two
in
the
afternoon
after
the
massacre
the
force
under
havelock
was
again
upon
the
march
for
cawnpore
the
heat
was
fearful
many
of
the
troops
were
struck
down
by
the
sun
and
the
cries
for
water
were
continuous
but
for
two
miles
the
column
toiled
on
and
then
came
in
sight
of
the
enemy
havelock
had
only
one
thousand
europeans
and
three
hundred
sikhs
he
had
no
cavalry
and
his
artillery
was
inferior
the
enemy
numbered
five
thousand
men
armed
and
trained
by
british
officers
strongly
intrenched
with
two
batteries
of
guns
of
heavy
calibre
havelock
artillery
failed
to
silence
the
batteries
and
he
ordered
the
europeans
to
charge
with
the
bayonet
on
they
went
in
the
face
of
a
shower
of
grape
but
the
bayonet
charge
was
as
irresistible
at
cawnpore
as
at
assaye
the
enemy
fought
for
a
while
like
men
in
a
death
struggle
nana
sahib
was
with
them
but
nothing
is
known
of
his
exploits
at
last
they
fled
and
there
was
no
cavalry
to
pursue
them
as
yet
nothing
was
known
of
the
butchery
of
the
women
and
children
havelock
halted
for
the
night
and
next
morning
marched
his
force
into
the
station
at
cawnpore
the
men
beheld
the
scene
of
the
massacre
and
saw
the
bleeding
remains
in
the
well
but
the
murderers
had
vanished
no
one
knew
whither
havelock
advanced
to
bithoor
and
destroyed
the
palace
of
the
mahratta
subsequently
he
was
joined
by
general
neill
with
reinforcements
from
allahabad
and
on
july
he
set
on
for
the
relief
of
lucknow
leaving
cawnpore
in
charge
of
general
neill
the
defence
of
lucknow
against
thousand
rebels
was
next
to
the
siege
of
delhi
the
greatest
event
in
the
mutiny
the
whole
province
of
oudh
was
in
a
blaze
of
insurrection
the
were
exasperated
at
the
hard
measure
dealt
out
to
them
before
the
appointment
of
sir
henry
lawrence
as
chief
commissioner
disbanded
sepoys
returning
to
their
homes
in
oudh
swelled
the
tide
of
disaffection
bandits
that
had
been
suppressed
under
british
administration
returned
to
their
old
work
of
robbery
and
brigandage
all
classes
took
advantage
of
the
anarchy
to
murder
the
meanwhile
the
country
was
bristling
with
the
fortresses
of
the
talukdars
and
the
cultivators
deprived
of
the
protection
of
the
english
naturally
flocked
for
refuge
to
the
strongholds
of
their
old
masters
the
english
who
had
been
lords
of
hindustan
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
century
had
been
closely
besieged
in
the
residency
at
lucknow
ever
since
the
final
outbreak
of
may
for
nearly
two
months
the
garrison
had
held
out
with
a
dauntless
intrepidity
while
confidently
waiting
for
reinforcements
that
seemed
never
to
come
never
surrender
had
been
from
the
first
the
passionate
conviction
of
sir
henry
lawrence
and
the
massacre
at
cawnpore
on
june
impressed
every
soldier
in
the
garrison
with
a
like
resolution
on
july
the
muchi
bawen
was
abandoned
and
the
garrison
and
stores
were
removed
to
the
residency
on
july
sir
henry
lawrence
was
killed
by
the
bursting
of
a
shell
in
a
room
where
he
lay
wounded
and
his
dying
counsel
to
those
around
him
was
never
surrender
on
july
the
rebel
force
round
lucknow
heard
of
the
advance
of
general
havelock
to
cawnpore
and
attacked
the
residency
in
overwhelming
force
they
kept
up
a
continual
fire
of
musketry
while
pounding
away
with
their
heavy
guns
but
the
garrison
held
their
ground
against
shot
and
shell
and
before
the
day
was
over
the
dense
masses
of
assailants
were
forced
to
retire
from
the
walls
between
july
and
general
havelock
began
to
cross
the
ganges
and
make
his
way
into
oudh
territory
but
he
was
unable
to
relieve
lucknow
his
small
force
was
weakened
by
heat
and
fever
and
reduced
by
cholera
and
dysentery
while
the
enemy
occupied
strong
positions
on
both
flanks
in
the
middle
of
august
he
fell
back
upon
cawnpore
during
the
four
months
that
followed
the
revolt
at
delhi
on
may
all
political
interest
was
centred
at
the
ancient
capital
of
the
sovereigns
of
hindustan
the
public
mind
was
occasionally
distracted
by
the
current
of
events
at
cawnpore
and
lucknow
as
well
as
at
other
stations
which
need
not
be
particularized
but
so
long
as
delhi
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
rebels
the
native
princes
were
bewildered
and
alarmed
and
its
prompt
recapture
was
deemed
of
vital
importance
to
the
prestige
of
the
british
government
and
the
reestablishment
of
british
sovereignty
in
hindustan
the
great
mogul
had
been
little
better
than
a
mummy
for
more
than
half
a
century
and
bahadur
shah
was
a
mere
tool
and
puppet
in
the
hands
of
rebel
sepoys
nevertheless
the
british
government
had
to
deal
with
the
astounding
fact
that
the
rebels
were
fighting
under
his
name
and
standard
just
as
afghans
and
mahrattas
had
done
in
the
days
of
ahmed
shah
durani
and
mahadaji
sindhia
to
make
matters
worse
the
roads
to
delhi
were
open
from
the
south
and
east
and
nearly
every
outbreak
in
hindustan
was
followed
by
a
stampede
of
mutineers
to
the
old
capital
of
the
moguls
meanwhile
in
the
absence
of
railways
there
were
unfortunate
delays
in
bringing
up
troops
and
guns
to
stamp
out
the
fires
of
rebellion
at
the
head
centre
the
highway
from
calcutta
to
delhi
was
blocked
up
by
mutiny
and
insurrection
and
every
european
soldier
sent
up
from
calcutta
was
stopped
for
the
relief
of
benares
allahabad
cawnpore
or
lucknow
but
the
possession
of
the
punjab
at
this
crisis
proved
to
be
the
salvation
of
the
empire
sir
john
lawrence
chief
commissioner
in
the
punjab
was
called
upon
for
almost
superhuman
work
to
maintain
order
in
a
conquered
province
to
suppress
mutiny
and
disaffection
among
the
very
sepoy
regiments
from
bengal
that
were
supposed
to
garrison
the
country
and
to
send
reënforcements
of
troops
and
guns
and
supplies
of
all
descriptions
to
the
siege
of
delhi
fortunately
the
sikhs
had
been
only
a
few
short
years
under
british
administration
they
had
not
forgotten
the
miseries
that
prevailed
under
the
native
government
and
could
appreciate
the
many
blessings
they
enjoyed
under
british
rule
they
were
stanch
to
the
british
government
and
eager
to
be
led
against
the
rebels
in
some
cases
terrible
punishment
was
meted
out
to
mutinous
bengal
sepoys
within
the
punjab
but
the
imperial
interests
at
stake
were
sufficient
to
justify
every
severity
although
all
must
regret
the
painful
necessity
that
called
for
such
extreme
measures
on
june
about
a
month
after
the
revolt
at
delhi
sir
henry
barnard
took
the
field
at
alipur
about
ten
miles
from
the
rebel
capital
he
defeated
an
advance
division
of
the
enemy
and
then
marched
to
the
ridge
and
reoccupied
the
old
cantonment
which
had
been
abandoned
on
may
so
far
it
was
clear
that
the
rebels
were
unable
to
do
anything
in
the
open
field
although
they
might
fight
bravely
under
cover
they
numbered
about
thirty
thousand
strong
they
had
a
very
powerful
artillery
and
ample
stores
of
ammunition
while
there
was
an
abundance
of
provisions
within
the
city
throughout
the
siege
in
the
middle
of
august
brigadier
john
nicholson
one
of
the
most
distinguished
officers
of
the
time
came
up
from
the
punjab
with
a
brigade
and
on
september
a
heavy
train
of
artillery
was
brought
in
from
firozpur
the
british
force
on
the
ridge
now
exceeded
eight
thousand
men
hitherto
the
artillery
had
been
too
weak
to
attempt
to
breach
the
city
walls
but
now
heavy
guns
were
brought
into
position
and
the
siege
began
in
earnest
from
september
to
four
batteries
poured
in
a
constant
storm
of
shot
and
shell
number
one
was
directed
against
the
cashmere
bastion
number
two
against
the
right
flank
of
the
cashmere
bastion
number
three
against
the
water
bastion
and
number
four
against
the
cashmere
and
water
gates
and
bastions
on
september
the
breaches
were
declared
to
be
practicable
and
the
following
morning
was
fixed
for
the
final
assault
upon
the
doomed
city
at
three
in
the
morning
of
september
three
assaulting
columns
were
formed
in
the
trenches
while
a
fourth
was
kept
in
reserve
the
first
column
was
led
by
brigadier
nicholson
the
second
by
brigadier
jones
the
third
by
colonel
campbell
and
the
fourth
or
reserve
by
brigadier
longfield
the
were
laid
at
the
cashmere
gate
by
lieutenants
home
and
salkeld
the
explosion
followed
and
the
third
column
rushed
in
and
pushed
toward
the
jumna
musjid
meanwhile
the
first
column
under
nicholson
escaladed
the
breaches
near
the
cashmere
gate
and
pushed
along
the
ramparts
toward
the
kabul
gate
carrying
the
several
bastions
in
the
way
here
it
was
met
by
the
second
column
under
brigadier
jones
who
had
escaladed
the
breach
at
the
water
bastion
the
advancing
columns
were
met
by
a
ceaseless
fire
from
terraced
houses
mosques
and
other
buildings
and
john
nicholson
the
hero
of
the
day
while
attempting
to
storm
a
narrow
street
near
the
kabul
gate
was
struck
down
by
a
shot
and
mortally
wounded
then
followed
six
days
of
desperate
warfare
no
quarter
was
given
to
men
with
arms
in
their
hands
but
women
and
children
were
spared
and
only
a
few
of
the
peaceable
inhabitants
were
sacrificed
during
the
storm
on
september
the
gates
of
the
old
fortified
palace
of
the
moguls
were
broken
open
but
the
royal
inmates
had
fled
no
one
was
left
but
a
few
wounded
sepoys
and
fugitive
fanatics
the
old
king
bahadur
shah
had
gone
off
to
the
great
mausoleum
without
the
city
known
as
the
tomb
of
humayun
it
was
a
vast
quadrangle
raised
on
terraces
and
enclosed
with
walls
it
contained
towers
buildings
and
monumental
marbles
in
memory
of
different
members
of
the
once
distinguished
family
as
well
as
extensive
gardens
surrounded
with
cloistered
cells
for
the
accommodation
of
pilgrims
on
september
captain
hodson
rode
to
the
tomb
arrested
the
king
and
brought
him
back
to
delhi
with
other
members
of
the
family
and
lodged
them
in
the
palace
the
next
day
he
went
again
with
one
hundred
horsemen
and
arrested
two
sons
of
the
king
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
armed
retainers
and
brought
them
away
in
a
native
carriage
near
the
city
the
carriage
was
surrounded
by
a
tumultuous
crowd
and
hodson
who
was
afraid
of
a
rescue
shot
both
princes
with
his
pistol
and
placed
their
bodies
in
a
public
place
for
all
men
to
see
thus
fell
the
imperial
city
captured
by
the
army
under
brigadier
wilson
before
the
arrival
of
any
of
the
reënforcements
from
england
the
losses
were
heavy
from
the
beginning
of
the
siege
to
the
close
the
british
army
at
delhi
had
nearly
four
thousand
killed
and
wounded
the
casualties
on
the
side
of
the
rebels
were
never
estimated
two
bodies
of
sepoys
broke
away
from
the
city
and
fled
down
the
valleys
of
the
jumna
and
ganges
followed
by
two
flying
columns
under
brigadiers
greathed
and
showers
but
the
great
mutiny
and
revolt
at
delhi
had
been
stamped
out
and
the
flag
of
england
waved
triumphantly
over
the
capital
of
hindustan
the
capture
of
delhi
in
september
was
the
in
the
sepoy
mutinies
the
revolt
was
crushed
beyond
redemption
the
rebels
were
deprived
of
their
head
centre
and
the
mogul
king
was
a
prisoner
at
the
mercy
of
the
power
whom
he
had
defied
but
there
were
still
troubles
in
india
lucknow
was
still
beleaguered
by
a
rebel
army
and
insurrections
still
ran
riot
in
oudh
and
rohilkhand
in
the
middle
of
august
general
havelock
had
fallen
back
on
cawnpore
after
the
failure
of
his
first
campaign
for
the
relief
of
lucknow
five
weeks
afterward
havelock
made
a
second
attempt
under
better
auspices
sir
colin
campbell
had
arrived
at
calcutta
as
sir
james
outram
had
come
up
to
allahabad
on
september
while
the
british
troops
were
storming
the
streets
of
delhi
outram
joined
havelock
and
neill
at
cawnpore
with
fourteen
hundred
men
as
senior
officer
he
might
have
assumed
the
command
but
with
generous
chivalry
the
bayard
of
india
waived
his
rank
in
honor
of
havelock
on
september
general
havelock
crossed
the
ganges
into
oudh
at
the
head
of
hundred
men
the
next
day
he
defeated
a
rebel
army
and
put
it
to
flight
while
four
of
the
enemy
guns
were
captured
by
outram
at
the
head
of
a
body
of
volunteer
cavalry
on
the
havelock
routed
a
still
larger
rebel
force
which
was
strongly
posted
at
a
garden
in
the
suburbs
of
lucknow
known
as
the
alumbagh
he
then
halted
to
give
his
soldiers
a
day
rest
on
the
he
was
cutting
his
way
through
the
streets
and
lanes
of
the
city
of
lucknow
running
the
gauntlet
of
a
deadly
and
unremitting
fire
from
the
houses
en
both
sides
of
the
streets
and
also
from
guns
which
commanded
them
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
he
entered
the
british
intrenchments
but
in
the
moment
of
victory
a
chance
shot
carried
off
the
gallant
neill
the
defence
of
the
british
residency
at
lucknow
is
a
glorious
episode
in
the
national
annals
the
fortitude
of
the
beleaguered
garrison
was
the
admiration
of
the
world
the
women
nursed
the
wounded
and
performed
every
womanly
duty
with
heroism
and
when
the
fight
was
over
they
received
the
thanks
of
her
majesty
queen
victoria
during
four
long
months
the
garrison
had
known
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
outer
world
they
were
aware
of
the
advance
and
retreat
of
havelock
and
that
was
all
at
last
on
september
they
heard
the
booming
of
the
guns
at
the
alumbagh
on
the
morning
of
the
they
could
see
something
of
the
growing
excitement
in
the
city
the
people
abandoning
their
houses
and
flying
across
the
river
still
the
guns
of
the
rebels
kept
up
a
heavy
cannonade
upon
the
residency
and
volleys
of
musketry
continued
to
pour
upon
the
besieged
from
the
loopholes
of
the
besiegers
but
soon
the
firing
was
heard
from
the
city
the
welcome
sounds
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
excitement
of
the
garrison
grew
beyond
control
presently
the
relieving
force
was
seen
fighting
its
way
toward
the
residency
then
the
feelings
of
the
garrison
burst
forth
in
deafening
cheers
and
wounded
men
in
hospital
crawled
out
to
join
in
the
chorus
of
welcome
then
followed
personal
greetings
as
officers
and
men
came
pouring
in
hands
were
frantically
shaken
on
all
sides
soldiers
took
the
children
from
their
arms
kissed
them
with
tears
rolling
down
their
cheeks
and
thanked
god
that
they
had
come
in
time
to
save
them
from
the
fate
of
the
sufferers
at
cawnpore
thus
after
a
siege
of
nearly
four
months
havelock
succeeded
in
relieving
lucknow
but
it
was
a
reenforcement
rather
than
a
relief
and
was
confined
to
the
british
residency
the
siege

the
city

army
he
left

two
thousand

take
charge
of
the
intrenchment
at
cawnpore
and
then
advanced
against
lucknow
with
five
thousand
men
and
thirty
guns
he
carried
several
of

enemy
positions
cut
his
way
to
the
residency
and
at

brought
away
the
beleaguered
garrison
with
all
the
women
and

not
even
then
could
he
disperse
the

accordingly
he
left

at

of
four
thousand

in

the
day
after
leaving
lucknow
general
havelock
was
carried
off
by
dysentery
and
buried
in

alumbagh
his
death
spread
a
gloom
over

by

time
his
name
had
become
a
household
word
wherever
the

language
was
spoken
in

panic
as
successive
stories
of
mutiny
and
rebellion
reached
england
and
culminated
in
the
revolt
at
delhi
and
massacre
at
cawnpore
the
victories
of
havelock
revived
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
british
nation
and
stirred
up
all
hearts
to
glorify
the
hero
who
had
stemmed
the
tide
of
disaffection
and
disaster
the
death
of
havelock
following
the
story
of
the
capture
of
delhi
and
told
with
the
same
breath
that
proclaimed
the
deliverance
at

was
received
in

with
a
universal
sorrow
that
will
never
be
forgotten
so
long

can
recall

memory
of
the

austria
remained
neutral
while
the
italian
kingdom
of
sardinia
joined
great
britain
france
and
turkey
against
russia
the
power
of
austria
still
kept
despotic
sway
over
the
states
of
italy
and
it
was
the
aim
of
victor
emmanuel
king
of
sardinia
to
throw
off
this
hinderance
to
italian
liberty
and
union
it
was
the
opinion
of
count
cavour
victor
emmanuel
minister
that
by
acting
with
the
allies
against
russia
sardinia
would
increase
her
prestige
with
the
european
powers
and
thereby
promote
the
movement
for
independence
the
success
of
the
allies
in
the
crimean
war
confirmed
the
prescience
of
cavour
napoleon
iii
wished
to
secure
for
france
supremacy
in
southern
europe
in
he
inquired
of
the
sardinian
minister
what
can
i
do
for
italy
the
crimean
war
ended
with
the
treaty
of
paris
in
at
the
congress
which
concluded
that
peace
cavour
presented
the
case
of
italy
against
austria
not
long
after
this
it
became
evident
that
napoleon
was
prepared
to
espouse
the
italian
cause
in
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
do
this
sardinia
now
prepared
for
war
austria
sent
an
ultimatum
demanding
a
reduction
of
the
sardinian
army
to
a
peace
footing
this
demand
was
refused
in
january
austria
mobilized
fresh
troops
on
the
italian
frontier
and
cavour
requested
garibaldi
to
organize
a
volunteer
corps
to
be
called
delle
hunters
of
the
alps
still
cavour
disclaimed
a
warlike
policy
denying
that
the
hostile
initiative
was
taken
by
sardinia
although
in
this
position
he
was
opposed
by
some
members
of
his
own
parliament
nevertheless
cavour
declared
i
believe
i
am
justified
in
proclaiming
aloud
in
the
presence
of
parliament
of
the
nation
and
of
europe
that
if
there
has
been
provocation
it
was
offered
by
austria
as
shown
by
orsi
the
italian
historian
the
great
minister
maintained
this
attitude
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
hold
back
from
the
actual
conflict
cavour
insisted
that
austria
must
be
the
aggressive
party
for
in
the
treaty
with
napoleon
iii
it
had
been
stipulated
that
france
would
come
to
the
help
of
sardinia
only
in
case
of
the
latter
being
attacked
by
austria
hence
cavour
was
obliged
to
seek
every
means
of
putting
his
country
into
the
attitude
of
the
provoked
party
how
many
disappointments
uncertainties
and
anxieties
crowded
those
days
from
february
to
the
end
of
april
in
order
to
understand
the
enormous
difficulties
overcome
by
cavour
it
would
be
necessary
to
follow
literally
day
by
day
the
history
of
that
period
in
march
he
repaired
to
paris
to
ascertain
napoleon
action
it
was
too
evident
however
that
french
public
opinion
was
unfavorable
to
war
and
the
emperor
was
wavering
russia
and
england
suggested
that
the
question
should
be
solved
by
a
congress
to
which
proposal
napoleon
iii
acceded
cavour
now
believed
all
was
lost
since
sardinia
could
not
refuse
without
putting
herself
in
the
wrong
fortunately
the
difficulty
was
solved
by
austria
boldly
insisting
that
sardinia
should
disarm
before
being
represented
at
the
congress
and
on
april
this
demand
was
enforced
by
an
ultimatum
to
be
answered
within
three
days
now
ensued
a
genuine
declaration
of
hostilities
and
most
joyfully
did
victor
emmanuel
make
the
following
announcement
to
his
troops
soldiers
austria
who
masses
her
armies
on
our
frontiers
and
threatens
to
invade
our
country
because
liberty
and
order
rule
there
because
concord
and
affection
between
sovereign
and
people
and
not
force
sway
the
state
because
there
the
anguished
cry
of
oppressed
italy
is
listened
to
austria
dares
to
tell
us
who
are
armed
only
in
our
own
defence
to
lay
down
those
arms
and
put
ourselves
in
her
power
such
an
outrageous
suggestion
surely
merits
a
condign
response
and
i
have
indignantly
refused
her
request
i
announce
this
to
you
in
the
certainty
that
you
will
make
the
wrong
done
to
your
king
and
to
your
nation
your
own
hence
mine
is
a
proclamation
of
war
arm
yourselves
therefore
in
readiness
for
it
you
will
be
confronted
by
an
ancient
enemy
who
is
both
valiant
and
disciplined
but
against
whom
you
need
not
fear
to
measure
your
strength
for
you
may
remember
with
pride
goito
pastrengo
santa
lucia
sommacampagna
and
above
all
custozza
where
four
brigades
fought
for
three
days
against
the
enemy
five
i
will
be
your
leader
your
prowess
in
action
has
already
been
tested
in
the
past
and
when
fighting
under
my
magnanimous
father
i
myself
proudly
recognized
your
valor
i
am
convinced
that
on
the
field
of
honor
and
glory
you
will
know
how
to
justify
as
well
as
to
augment
your
military
renown
you
will
have
as
comrades
those
intrepid
french

conquerors
in
so
many
distinguished
campaigns
with
whom
you
fought

whom
napoleon

always
prompt
to
further
the
defence
of
a
righteous
cause
and
the
victory
of
civilization
generously
sends
in
great
numbers
to
our
aid
march
then
confident
of
success
and
wreathe
with
fresh
laurels
that
standard
which
rallying
from
all
quarters
the
flower
of
italian
youth
to
its
threefold
colors
points
out
your
task
of
accomplishing
that
righteous
and
sacred
enterprise
the
independence
of
italy
wherein
we
find
our
the
austrian
army
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
seventy
thousand
men
besides
those
remaining
in
the
fortresses
was
commanded
by
general
gyulai
the
successor
of
radetzky
who
had
died
the
year
before
at
the
age
of
gyulai
meant
to
attack
and
rout
the
sardinian
army
before
it
could
join
its
french
allies
on
april
he
crossed
the
ticino
then
spreading
out
his
forces
along
the
sesia
he
reconnoitred
as
far
as
chivasso
these
districts
abound
in
cultivated
and
are
intersected
by
many
canals
it
was
therefore
easy
by
flooding
the
ground
to
hinder
the
march
of
the
austrian
troops
on
turin
meanwhile
the
sardinian
army
composed
of
sixty
thousand
men
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
french
forces
on
the
right
bank
of
the
po
on
may
napoleon
iii
already
preceded
into
italy
by
one
hundred
twenty
thousand
of
his
men
debarked
at
genoa
and
on
the
was
at
alessandria
where
near
the
mouth
of
the
tanaro
the
allied
armies
met
the
austrian
troops
covered
a
long
tract
from
novara
to
vercelli
then
extended
down
the
line
of
the
sesia
as
far
as
the
po
and
thence
reached
the
mouth
of
the
tanaro
gyulai
seeing
the
enemy
concentrated
on
the
right
bank
of
the
po
believed
that
napoleon
iii
intended
crossing
that
river
in
the
direction
of
piacenza
as
napoleon
i
had
crossed
in
and
so
massed
his
troops
to
the
south
at
this
juncture
a
portion
of
his
army
encountered
the
french
and
sardinians
at
montebello
where
the
extreme
right
wing
of
the
allies
was
posted
the
austrian
general
met
with
such
a
determined
resistance
that
he
imagined
this
must
be
the
centre
of
the
enemy
and
felt
convinced
that
he
had
guessed
the
intention
he
therefore
caused
his
army
to
pursue
its
march
southward
by
this
movement
vercelli
was
abandoned
by
the
austrians
and
it
was
immediately
reoccupied
by
the
sardinians
napoleon
now
prepared
a
bold
flank
movement
by
leaving
the
po
for
the
ticino
and
to
mask
this
manoeuvre
ordered
the
sardinians
to
make
an
advance
thus
while
victor
emmanuel
at
the
head
of
his
men
flung
himself
from
vercelli
on
palestro
meriting
by
the
skill
of
his
military
tactics
the
acclamations
of
a
regiment
of
zouaves
whom
he
headed
as
corporal
the
french
taking
ad
vantage
of
the
alessandria
casale
and
novara
railway
made
for
the
bridge
of
buffalora
over
the
ticino
only
then
did
gyulai
perceive
this
clever
stratagem
which
threw
lombardy
open
to
the
allies
and
he
was
consequently
obliged
to
cross
the
ticino
to
block
the
enemy
way
to
milan
on
june
at
magenta
nearly
the
whole
of
the
austrian
army
engaged
the
french
forces
the
battle
which
was
most
desperate
lasted
all
day
and
was
remarkable
for
the
prodigies
of
valor
performed
the
austrians
driven
back
into
magenta
itself
maintained
even
in
that
village
such
a
stout
resistance
that
they
had
to
be
dislodged
by
fighting
on
june
victor
emmanuel
and
napoleon
iii
made
their
triumphal
entry
into
milan
now
freed
from
the
austrian
yoke
on
the
same
day
a
french
corps
repulsed
the
austrians
at
melegnano
while
garibaldi
entered
bergamo
from
the
other
side
garibaldi
who
had
been
the
last
to
leave
lombardy
in
was
now
the
first
to
set
foot
in
its
territory
in
since
may
he
had
led
his
own
cacciatori
to
the
lombard
shores
of
lake
maggiore
had
defeated
the
austrians
at
varese
entered
como
routed
the
enemy
afresh
at
san
fermo
and
was
now
proceeding
to
bergamo
and
brescia
with
the
intention
of
reaching
the
trentine
alps
to
cut
off
the
enemy
retreat
after
the
battle
of
magenta
gyulai
had
been
dismissed
from
the
command
and
his
post
was
assumed
by
the
emperor
francis
joseph
himself
assisted
by
the
aged
marshal
hess
on
the
night
of
june
the
retreating
austrians
crossed
the
mincio
but
a
few
hours
after
retraced
their
steps
and
took
up
their
position
on
the
hills
to
the
south
of
the
lake
of
garda
on
the
morning
of
the
the
army
began
their
march
at
dawn
and
shortly
afterward
to
their
great
amazement
encountered
the
austrians
who
they
imagined
had
crossed
the
mincio
the
night
before
the
struggle
was
terrible
in
fact
the
line
covered
by
the
fighting
extended
a
distance
of
five
leagues
a
series
of
hills
dominated
by
solferino
and
san
martino
formed
the
positions
the
army
had
to
assail
the
french
contested
solferino
with
the
austrians
and
after
a
hotly
disputed
battle
of
more
than
twelve
hours
succeeded
in
occupying
it
the
sardinians
led
by
victor
emmanuel
made
a
violent
assault
on
san
martino
four
times
in
succession
did
they
take
it
only
to
lose
it
again
but
the
fifth
time
they
made
themselves
masters
of
it
for
good
and
all
by
six
in
the
evening
the
strength
of
the
austrian
army
was
everywhere
broken
just
then
a
frightful
hurricane
heralded
by
clouds
of
dust
and
accompanied
by
torrents
of
rain
burst
over
the
two
armies
and
thus
favored
the
flight
of
the
austrian
battalions
napoleon
iii
now
fixed
his
headquarters
at
cavriana
in
the
same
house
that
francis
joseph
had
tenanted
during
the
action
on
that
vast
battlefield
the
combatants
had
numbered
three
hundred
thousand
men
one
hundred
sixty
thousand
austrians
and
one
hundred
forty
thousand
french
and
sardinians
of
all
these
after
that
sanguinary
struggle
thousand
were
left
dead
or
wounded
after
a
few
days
rest
the
army
crossed
the
mincio
and
besieged
peschiera
now
there
seemed
a
chance
of
the
italians
fulfilling
the
hope
they
had
so
long
cherished
of
expelling
the
foreigners
they
confidently
awaited
news
of
fresh
feats
of
arms
in
the
quadrilateral
and
of
the
success
of
the
fleet
sent
by
france
and
sardinia
into
adriatic
waters
but
instead
came
the
most
unexpected
tidings
imaginable
on
july
napoleon
iii
had
met
francis
joseph
and
three
days
later
the
preliminaries
of
peace
were
signed
at
villafranca
by
this
treaty
austria
was
to
cede
lombardy
to
napoleon
who
was
to
relegate
it
to
sardinia
the
italian
states
were
to
be
amalgamated
into
a
confederation
under
the
presidency
of
the
pope
but
venice
though
forming
part
of
this
same
confederation
was
to
remain
under
austrian
rule
great
indeed
was
the
mortification
of
all
italy
on
hearing
such
terms
of
peace
announced
cavour
who
had
devoted
all
his
marvellous
talents
to
realizing
the
ideal
of
national
redemption
and
had
believed
his
ends
so
nearly
attained
hastened
to
his
prince
and
in
a
melancholy
interview
advised
him
not
to
accept
such
conditions
but
victor
emmanuel
although
it
caused
his
very
heart
to
bleed
signed
the
treaty
adding
these
words
i
approve
as
far
as
i
myself
am
concerned
whereupon
cavour
sent
in
his
resignation
what
was
the
motive
that
had
induced
napoleon
to
break
his
lately
made
promise
of
freeing
italy
from
the
alps
to
the
adriatic
there
were
many
reasons
which
influenced
him
the
sight
of
that
immense
battlefield
strewn
with
the
bodies
of
the
slain
the
determined
resistance
of
the
austrian
soldiers
the
difficulties
which
would
have
to
be
faced
in
the
quadrilateral
the
hostile
attitude
of
prussia
were
all
motives
which
combined
to
sway
the
french
emperor
mind
but
there
was
also
another
reason
which
counted
for
much
napoleon
had
been
drawn
into
this
campaign
without
really
knowing
the
state
of
italian
public
opinion
he
wished
italy
to
be
free
from
the
alps
to
the
adriatic
but
did
not
want
italian
unity
rather
did
he
desire
the
formation
of
a
confederacy
wherein
france
could
always
make
her
own
predominance
felt
in
the
peninsula
scarcely
had
he
arrived
in
italy
when
he
was
forced
to
see
that
italian
ideals
were
very
different
from
what
he
had
imagined
them
to
be
trials
had
but
ripened
the
virtues
of
prudence
and
wisdom
in
men
minds
in
the
people
were
little
likely
to
repeat
the
blunders
of
or
and
there
were
now
no
longer
discussions
over
forms
of
government
but
everywhere
a
unanimous
resolve
to
rally
round
the
liberal
monarchy
of
savoy
on
the
first
proclamation
of
the
war
the
grand
duke
of
tuscany
had
been
compelled
to
fly
from
his
states
april
napoleon
had
imagined
that
in
this
province
the
ancient
stronghold
of
italian
municipalism
it
would
be
easy
to
form
a
new
kingdom
with
a
bonaparte
to
wear
its
crown
with
this
aim
in
view

fifth
french
army

by

jerome
napoleon
had
debarked
at
leghorn
under
the
pretext
of
organizing
the
military
forces
of
central
italy
and
harassing
the
austrians
on
the
extreme
left
but
the
tuscans
soon
divined
the
real
intention
of
the
french
and
the
provisional
government
in
florence
previously
instituted
under
bettino
ricasoli
suddenly
avowed
its
intention
of
uniting
tuscany
to
sardinia
whereupon
prince
napoleon
seeing
the
true
attitude
of
the
country
found
it
advisable
to
affect
to
promote
the
annexation
the
duchies
of
parma
and
modena
had
also
been
deserted
by
their
dukes
and
the
papal
legates
had
to
quit
romagna
whose
inhabitants
now
suddenly
announced
their
fusion
with
sardinia
indeed
this
impulse
for
annexation
now
began
to
spread
and
to
the
cry
of
victor
emmanuel
the
marches
and
umbria
revolted
against
the
pontiff
but
in
these
regions
the
movement
was
sanguinarily
suppressed
by
the
swiss
troops
napoleon
iii
was
displeased
to
note
how
all
italian
aspirations
tended
to
unity
and
thus
it
was
that
he
had
signed
the
treaty
of
villafranca
peace
was
concluded
at
zurich
in
the
november
following
and
there
the
idea
of
an
italian
confederation
was
mooted
afresh
the
fugitive
princes
ought
to
have
returned
to
their
states
but
how
was
it
possible
they
certainly
could
not
hope
to
be
recalled
by
their
subjects
for
the
latter
had
expelled
them
occupying
their
kingdoms
with
troops
of
their
own
was
out
of
the
question
because
they
had
none
foreign
aid
moreover
was
not
to
be
looked
for
since
napoleon
iii
had
established
the
principle
of
then
the
people
of
central
italy
showed
themselves
capable
of
a
bold
political
under
the
leadership
of
bettino
ricasoli
dictator
in
tuscany
and
luigi
carlo
farini
who
held
a
similar
office
in
emilia
and
romagna
they
declared
by
means
of
their
assembled
deputies
their
earnest
desire
to
be
incorporated
with
sardinia
the
new
ministry
formed
at
turin
after
cavour
resignation
had
pursued
its
way
timidly
fearing
to
rouse
the
suspicion
and
displeasure
of
the
european
powers
but
at
this
momentous
and
difficult
juncture
cavour
again
accepted
the
premiership
january
he
immediately
gave
a
bolder
impetus
to
king
victor
emmanuel
policy
by
sending
a
note
to
all
the
powers
in
which
he
asserted
it
to
be
now
impossible
for
sardinia
to
offer
any
resistance
to
the
inevitable
course
of
events
cavour
imagined
that
since
napoleon
iii
had
obtained
the
imperial
throne
by
a
plebiscite
he
would
not
deny
the
validity
of
such
a
claim
in
italy
and
forthwith
submitted
this
idea
to
the
emperor
who
was
bound
to
approve
of
it
but
the
french
nation
was
discontented
imagining
that
the
blood
it
had
shed
for
italy
had
profited
nothing
and
was
moreover
very
averse
to
the
formation
of
a
powerful
kingdom
beyond
the
alps
now
it
was
that
cavour
determined
on
a
great
sacrifice
in
the
convention
of
plombières
it
had
been
agreed
that
in
the
event
of
a
kingdom
of
eleven
million
inhabitants
being
established
from
the
alps
to
the
adriatic
sardinia
would
cede
savoy
to
france
as
however
by
the
treaty
of
villafranca
venetia
had
remained
under
the
austrian
yoke
no
more
had
been
said
about
cession
of
territory
but
by
the
annexation
of
central
italy
the
number
of
victor
emmanuel
subjects
was
now
augmented
to
eleven
millions
in
order
to
induce
napoleon
iii
to
approve
of
such
an
annexation
cavour
offered
him
savoy
but
the
emperor
claimed
nice
as
well
and
the
minister
was
obliged
to
accede
to
his
demands
on
march
savoy
the
cradle
of
the
reigning
dynasty
and
nice
garibaldi
native
province
were
ceded
to
france
garibaldi
deeply
wounded
in
his
tenderest
feelings
violently
abused
cavour
in
parliament
but
the
chamber
although
it
respected
the
hero
emotion
ratified
the
treaty
which
was
at
this
crisis
a
necessary
concession
at
the
same
time
parma
modena
romagna
and
tuscany
expressed
by
universal
suffrage
their
cordial
desire
for
union
with
sardinia
and
a
few
days
later
the
fusion
of
these
provinces
with
the
dominions
of
the
house
of
savoy
was
an
accomplished
fact
on
april
at
the
opening
of
the
new
parliament
victor
emmanuel
could
thus
sum
up
the
results
already
obtained
by
the
nationalist
party
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
an
invasion
repulsed

by
valiant

darwin
publishes
his
origin
of
species
charles
robert
darwin
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
credit
due
to
other
scientists
for
investigation
or
discovery
in
natural
selection
the
preeminence
of
darwin
in
this
field
is
undisputed
if
of
any
scientific
book
it
can
be
said
that
its
appearance
was
it
is
true
of
darwin
work
the
origin
of
species
by
means
of
natural
selection
or
the
preservation
of
favored
races
in
the
struggle
for
not
only
did
it
command
the
earnest
attention
of
the
scientific
and
literary
world
but
it
awakened
the
interest
of
thoughtful
persons
everywhere
later
research
and
criticism
have
modified
the
effect
of
his
conclusions
and
led
to
new
results
but
the
darwinian
theory
or
darwinism
still
holds
and
seems
likely
long
to
maintain
a
central
place
in
the
history
of
modern
scientific
development
charles
robert
darwin
was
born
at
shrewsbury
england
february
he
was
the
grandson
of
erasmus
darwin
an
eminent
physician
naturalist
and
poet
who
in
published
an
important
work
entitled
or
the
laws
of
organic
charles
darwin
was
heir
to
a
fortune
and
in
youth
the
possession
of
ample
means
prevented
him
from
taking
any
deep
interest
in
studying
for
a
profession
although
he
did
study
medicine
and
later
for
the
church
but
before
reaching
his
majority
he
turned
to
natural
history
at
cambridge
he
enjoyed
an
intimacy
with
the
distinguished
botanist
professor
john
henslow
who
quickened
the
young
man
enthusiasm
for
scientific
investigation
in
his
year
darwin
went
as
naturalist
with
a
government
expedition
to
patagonia
the
voyage
in
the
beagle
was
continued
round
the
world
darwin
journals
of
the
expedition
served
him
in
his
later
work
and
also
furnished
much
material
for
popular
information
from
when
he
went
to
reside
at
down
in
kent
he
devoted
himself
wholly
to
a
life
of
scientific
research
and
writing
since
it
is
not
an
uncommon
error
to
confound
natural
selection
with
evolution
it
may
be
well
to
point
out
that
while
based
on
evolution
darwinism
is
distinct
from
it
evolution
is
the
development
of
new
organisms
through
heredity
variation
and
adaptation
darwinism
or
the
doctrine
of
natural
selection
as
best
defined
in
these
pages
by
darwin
himself
is
seen
to
involve
quite
different
factors
from
those
of
evolution
as
thus
restricted
for
candor
and
childlike
simplicity
the
writings
of
darwin
are
especially
noteworthy
among
the
modest
utterances
of
great
men
and
nowhere
are
these
qualities
more
strikingly
revealed
than
in
the
following
account
of
the
production
of
his
principal
work
from
september
i
devoted
my
whole
time
to
arranging
my
huge
pile
of
notes
to
observing
and
to
experimenting
in
relation
to
the
transmutation
of
species
during
the
voyage
of
the
beagle
i
had
been
deeply
impressed
by
discovering
in
the
pampean
formation
great
fossil
animals
covered
with
armor
like
that
on
the
existing
armadillos
secondly
by
the
manner
in
which
closely
allied
animals
replace
one
another
in
proceeding
southward
over
the
continent
and
thirdly
by
the
south
american
character
of
most
of
the
productions
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
and
more
especially
by
the
manner
in
which
they
differ
slightly
on
each
island
of
the
group
none
of
the
islands
appearing
to
be
very
ancient
in
a
geological
sense
it
was
evident
that
such
facts
as
these
as
well
as
many
others
could
be
explained
only
on
the
supposition
that
species
gradually
become
modified
and
the
subject
haunted
me
but
it
was
equally
evident
that
neither
the
action
of
the
surrounding
conditions
nor
the
will
of
the
organisms
especially
in
the
case
of
plants
could
account
for
the
innumerable
cases
in
which
organisms
of
every
kind
are
beautifully
adapted
to
their
habits
of
life
for
instance
a
woodpecker
or
a
to
climb
trees
or
a
seed
for
dispersal
by
hooks
or
plumes
i
had
always
been
much
struck
by
such
adaptations
and
until
these
could
be
explained
it
seemed
to
me
almost
useless
to
endeavor
to
prove
by
indirect
evidence
that
species
have
been
modified
after
my
return
to
england
it
appeared
to
me
that
by
following
the
example
of
lyell
in
geology
and
by
collecting
all
facts
which
bore
in
any
way
on
the
variation
of
animals
and
plants
under
domestication
and
nature
some
light
might
perhaps
be
thrown
on
the
whole
subject
my
first
was
opened
in
july
i
worked
on
true
baconian
principles
and
without
any
theory
collected
facts
on
a
wholesale
scale
more
especially
with
respect
to
domesticated
productions
by
printed
inquiries
by
conversation
with
skilful
breeders
and
gardeners
and
by
extensive
reading
when
i
see
the
list
of
books
of
all
kinds
which
i
read
and
abstracted
including
whole
series
of
journals
and
transactions
i
am
surprised
at
my
industry
i
soon
perceived
that
selection
was
the
keystone
of
man
success
in
making
useful
races
of
animals
and
plants
but
how
selection
could
be
applied
to
organisms
living
in
a
state
of
nature
remained
for
some
time
a
mystery
to
me
in
october
that
is
fifteen
months
after
i
had
begun
my
systematic
inquiry
i
happened
to
read
for
amusement
malthus
on
the
principle
of
and
being
well
prepared
to
appreciate
the
struggle
for
existence
which
everywhere
goes
on
from
observation
of
the
habits
of
animals
and
plants
it
at
once
struck
me
that
under
these
circumstances
favorable
variations
would
tend
to
be
preserved
and
unfavorable
ones
to
be
destroyed
the
result
of
this
would
be
the
formation
of
new
species
here
then
i
had
at
last
got
a
theory
by
which
to
work
but
i
was
so
anxious
to
avoid
prejudice
that
i
determined
not
for
some
time
to
write
even
the
briefest
sketch
of
it
in
june
i
first
allowed
myself
the
satisfaction
of
writing
a
very
brief
abstract
of
my
theory
in
pencil
in
pages
and
this
was
enlarged
during
the
summer
of
into
one
of
two
hundred
thirty
pages
which
i
had
fairly
copied
out
and
still
possess
but
at
that
time
i
overlooked
one
problem
of
great
importance
and
it
is
astonishing
to
me
except
on
the
principle
of
columbus
and
his
egg
how
i
could
have
overlooked
it
and
its
solution
this
problem
is
the
tendency
in
organic
beings
descended
from
the
same
stock
to
diverge
in
character
as
they
become
modified
that
they
have
diverged
greatly
is
obvious
from
the
manner
in
which
species
of
all
kinds
can
be
classed
under
genera
genera
under
families
families
under
and
so
on
and
i
can
remember
the
very
spot
in
the
road
while
riding
in
my
carriage
that
to
my
joy
the
solution
occurred
to
me
and
this
was
long
after
i
had
come
to
down
the
solution
as
i
believe
is
that
the
modified
offspring
of
all
dominant
and
increasing
forms
tend
to
become
adapted
to
many
and
highly
diversified
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
early
in
lyell
advised
me
to
write
out
my
views
fully
and
i
began
at
once
to
do
so
on
a
scale
three
or
four
times
as
extensive
as
that
which
was
afterward
followed
in
my
of
yet
it
was
only
an
abstract
of
the
materials
which
i
had
collected
and
i
got
through
about
half
the
work
on
this
scale
but
my
plans
were
overthrown
for
early
in
the
summer
of
alfred
russel
wallace
who
was
then
in
the
malay
archipelago
sent
me
an
essay
the
tendency
of
varieties
to
depart
indefinitely
from
the
original
and
this
essay
contained
exactly
the
same
theory
as
mine
wallace
expressed
the
wish
that
if
i
thought
well
of
his
essay
i
should
send
it
to
lyell
for
perusal
the
circumstances
under
which
i
consented
at
the
request
of
lyell
and
hooker
to
allow
of
an
abstract
from
my
manuscript
together
with
a
letter
to
asa
gray
dated
september
to
be
published
at
the
same
time
with
wallace
essay
are
given
in
the
of
the
proceedings
of
the
linnean
i
was
at
first
very
unwilling
to
consent
as
i
thought
wallace
might
consider
my
doing
so
unjustifiable
for
i
did
not
then
know
how
generous
and
noble
was
his
disposition
neither
the
extract
from
my
manuscript
nor
the
letter
to
gray
had
been
intended
for
publication
and
they
were
badly
written
wallace
essay
on
the
other
hand
was
admirably
expressed
and
quite
clear
nevertheless
our
joint
productions
excited
very
little
attention
and
the
only
published
notice
of
them
which
i
can
remember
was
by
professor
haughton
of
dublin
whose
verdict
was
that
all
that
was
new
in
them
was
false
and
what
was
true
was
old
this
shows
how
necessary
it
is
that
any
new
view
should
be
explained
at
considerable
length
in
order
to
arouse
public
attention
in
september
i
set
to
work
by
the
strong
advice
of
lyell
and
hooker
to
prepare
a
volume
on
the
transmutation
of
species
but
was
often
interrupted
by
and
short
visits
to
doctor
delightful
hydropathic
establishment
at
moor
park
i
abstracted
the
manuscript
begun
on
a
much
larger
scale
in
and
completed
the
volume
on
the
same
reduced
scale
it
cost
me
thirteen
months
and
ten
days
hard
labor
it
was
published
under
the
title
of
the
of
in
november
though
considerably
added
to
and
corrected
in
the
later
editions
it
has
remained
substantially
the
same
book
it
is
no
doubt
the
chief
work
of
my
life
it
was
from
the
first
highly
successful
the
first
small
edition
of
twelve
hundred
fifty
copies
was
sold
on
the
day
of
publication
and
a
second
edition
of
three
thousand
copies
soon
afterward
sixteen
thousand
copies
have
now
been
sold
in
england
and
considering
how
stiff
a
book
it
is
this
is
a
large
number
it
has
been
translated
into
almost
every
european
tongue
even
into
such
languages
as
spanish
bohemian
polish
and
russian
it
has
also
according
to
miss
bird
been
translated
into
japanese
and
is
much
studied
in
that
country
even
an
essay
on
it
has
appeared
in
hebrew
showing
that
the
theory
is
contained
in
the
old
testament
the
reviews
were
very
numerous
for
some
time
i
collected
all
that
appeared
on
the
and
on
my
related
books
and
these
amount
excluding
newspaper
reviews
to
two
hundred
but
after
a
time
i
gave
up
the
attempt
in
despair
many
separate
essays
and
books
on
the
subject
have
appeared
and
in
germany
a
catalogue
or
bibliography
on
darwinismus
has
appeared
every
year
or
two
the
success
of
the
may
i
think
be
attributed
in
large
part
to
my
having
long
before
written
two
condensed
sketches
and
to
my
having
finally
abstracted
a
much
larger
manuscript
which
was
itself
an
abstract
by
this
means
i
was
enabled
to
select
the
more
striking
facts
and
conclusions
i
had
also
during
many
years
followed
a
golden
rule
namely
whenever
a
published
fact
a
new
observation
or
thought
came
across
me
which
was
opposed
to
my
general
results
to
make
a
memorandum
of
it
without
fail
and
at
once
for
i
had
found
by
experience
that
such
facts
and
thoughts
were
far
more
apt
to
escape
from
the
memory
than
favorable
ones
owing
to
this
habit
very
few
objections
were
raised
against
my
views
which
i
had
not
at
least
noticed
and
attempted
to
answer
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
the
success
of
the
proved
that
the
subject
was
in
the
air
or
that
men
minds
were
prepared
for
it
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
strictly
true
for
i
occasionally
sounded
not
a
few
naturalists
and
never
happened
to
come
across
a
single
one
who
seemed
to
doubt
about
the
permanence
of
species
even
lyell
and
hooker
though
they
would
listen
with
interest
to
me
never
seemed
to
agree
i
tried
once
or
twice
to
explain
to
able
men
what
i
meant
by
natural
selection
but
signally
failed
what
i
believe
was
strictly
true
is
that
innumerable
facts
were
stored
in
the
minds
of
naturalists
ready
to
take
their
proper
places
as
soon
as
any
theory
that
would
receive
them
was
sufficiently
explained
another
element
in
the
success
of
the
book
was
its
moderate
size
and
this
i
owe
to
the
appearance
of
wallace
essay
had
i
published
on
the
scale
in
which
i
began
to
write
in
the
book
would
have
been
four
or
five
times
as
large
as
the
and
very
few
would
have
had
the
patience
to
read
it
i
gained
much
by
my
delay
in
publishing
from
about
when
the
theory
was
clearly
conceived
to
and
i
lost
nothing
by
it
for
i
cared
very
little
whether
men
attributed
more
originality
to
me
or
to
wallace
and
his
essay
no
doubt
aided
in
the
reception
of
the
theory
i
was
forestalled
in
only
one
important
point
which
my
vanity
has
always
made
me
regret
namely
the
explanation
by
means
of
the
glacial
period
of
the
presence
of
the
same
species
of
plants
and
of
some
few
animals
on
distant
mountain
summits
and
in
the
arctic
regions
this
view
pleased
me
so
much
that
i
wrote
it
out
and
i
believe
that
it
was
read
by
hooker
some
years
before
edward
forbes
published
his
celebrated
memoir
on
the
subject
in
the
very
few
points
in
which
we
differed
i
still
think
that
i
was
in
the
right
i
have
never
of
course
alluded
in
print
to
my
having
independently
worked
out
this
view
hardly
any
point
gave
me
so
much
satisfaction
when
i
was
at
work
on
the
as
the
explanation
of
the
wide
difference
in
many
classes
between
the
embryo
and
the
adult
animal
and
of
the
close
resemblance
of
the
embryos
within
the
same
class
no
notice
of
this
point
was
taken
as
far
as
i
remember
in
the
early
reviews
of
the
and
i
recollect
expressing
my
surprise
on
this
head
in
a
letter
to
asa
gray
within
late
years
several
reviewers
have
given
the
whole
credit
to
fritz
mueller
and
haeckel
who
undoubtedly
have
worked
it
out
much
more
fully
and
in
some
respects
more
correctly
than
i
did
i
had
materials
for
a
whole
chapter
on
the
subject
and
i
ought
to
have
made
the
discussion
longer
for
it
is
clear
that
i
failed
to
impress
my
readers
and
he
who
succeeds
in
doing
so
deserves
in
my
opinion
all
the
credit
this
leads
me
to
remark
that
i
have
almost
without
exception
been
treated
honestly
by
my
reviewers
passing
over
those
without
scientific
knowledge
as
not
worthy
of
notice
my
views
have
often
been
grossly
misrepresented
bitterly
opposed
and
ridiculed
but
this
has
been
generally
done
as
i
believe
in
good
faith
on
the
whole
i
do
not
doubt
that
my
works
have
been
repeatedly
and
greatly
overpraised
i
rejoice
that
i
have
avoided
controversies
and
this
i
owe
to
lyell
who
many
years
ago
in
reference
to
my
geological
works
strongly
advised
me
never
to
get
entangled
in
a
controversy
as
it
rarely
did
any
good
and
caused
a
miserable
loss
of
time
and
temper
whenever
i
have
found
out
that
i
have
blundered
or
that
my
work
has
been
imperfect
and
when
i
have
been
contemptuously
criticised
and
even
when
i
have
been
overpraised
so
that
i
have
felt
mortified
it
has
been
my
greatest
comfort
to
say
hundreds
of
times
to
myself
that
i
have
worked
as
hard
and
as
well
as
i
could
and
no
man
can
do
more
than
this
i
remember
when
in
good
success
bay
in
terra
del
fuego
thinking
and
i
believe
that
i
wrote
home
to
that
effect
that
i
could
not
employ
my
life
better
than
in
adding
a
little
to
natural
science
this
i
have
done
to
the
best
of
my
abilities
and
critics
may
say
what
they
like
but
they
can
not
destroy
this
conviction
during
the
last
two
months
of
i
was
fully
occupied
in
preparing
a
second
edition
of
the
and
by
an
enormous
correspondence
on
january
i
began
arranging
my
notes
for
my
work
on
the
of
animals
and
plants
under
domestication
but
it
was
not
published
until
the
beginning
of
the
delay
having
been
caused
partly
by
frequent
periods
of
illness
one
of
which
lasted
seven
months
and
partly
by
being
tempted
to
publish
on
other
subjects
which
at
the
time
interested
me
more
my
of
was
published
in
february
as
soon
as
i
had
become
in
the
year
or
convinced
that
species
were
mutable
productions
i
could
not
avoid
the
belief
that
man
must
come
under
the
same
law
accordingly
i
collected
notes
on
the
subject
for
my
own
satisfaction
but
not
for
a
long
time
with
any
intention
of
publishing
although
in
the
of
the
derivation
of
any
particular
species
is
never
discussed
yet
i
thought
it
best
in
order
that
no
honorable
man
should
accuse
me
of
concealing
my
views
to
add
that
by
the
work
light
would
be
thrown
on
the
origin
of
man
and
his
history
it
would
have
been
useless
and
injurious
to
the
success
of
the
book
to
parade
without
giving
any
evidence
my
conviction
with
respect
to
his
origin
but
when
i
found
that
many
naturalists
fully
accepted
the
doctrine
of
the
evolution
of
species
it
seemed
to
me
advisable
to
work
up
such
notes
as
i
possessed
and
to
publish
a
special
treatise
on
the
origin
of
man
i
was
the
more
glad
to
do
so
as
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
fully
discussing
sexual
selection
a
subject
which
had
always
greatly
interested
me
this
subject
and
that
of
the
variation
of
our
domestic
productions
together
with
the
causes
and
laws
of
variation
inheritance
and
the
intercrossing
of
plants
are
the
sole
subjects
which
i
have
been
able
to
write
about
in
full
so
as
to
use
all
the
materials
which
i
have
collected
the
of
took
me
three
years
to
write
but
then
as
usual
some
of
this
time
was
lost
by
and
some
was
consumed
by
preparing
new
editions
and
other
minor
works
a
second
and
largely
corrected
edition
of
the
appeared
in
the
kingdom
of
italy
established

and

of

of

who
had
headed
the
movement
for
italian
independence
and
had
been

in

new

succeeded
to
the
throne

the
day
of
his
father
defeat
at
novara
he
was
a
liberal
sovereign
and
zealous
for
the
cause
of
his
country
with
the
aid
of
his
great
minister
count
cavour
he
proceeded
with
the
work
of
securing
the
unity
and
freedom
of
italy
in
sardinia
and
france
in
alliance
defeated
austria
in
this
war
were
made
the
substantial
beginnings
from
which
a
new
italian
nationality
was
to
be
realized
italian
unity
was
not
the
object
of
napoleon
iii
in
his
alliance
with
italy
against
austria
but
he
did
much
to
advance
its
prospects
he
even
promised
the
complete
liberation
of
italy
but
this
promise
he
failed
to
fulfil
to
the
great
disappointment
of
italian
statesmen
napoleon
wished
to
see
an
italian
confederation
with
the
pope
at
its
head
but
this
plan
was
rejected
sicily
and
naples
in
southern
italy
were
still
governed
by
a
bourbon
prince
it
was
necessary
to
get
rid
of
him
but
victor
emmanuel
did
not
desire
another
war
the
matter
was
decided
through
the
action
of
garibaldi
whose
first
step
toward
ending
the
last
remnant
of
bourbon
rule
in
italy
was
a
bold
descend
upon
sicily
this
movement
he
made
against
the
wishes
of
cavour
and
in
furtherance
of
the
plans
of
young
italy
his
own
account
of
his
landing
at
marsala
and
of
the
battle
of
calatafimi
regarded
by
him
as
one
of
the
most
memorable
in
his
military
experience
is
as
characteristic
of
garibaldi
the
man
and
writer
as
were
his
exploits
characteristic
of
garibaldi
the
soldier
the
events
that
quickly
followed
garibaldi
descent
upon
sicily
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
italian
history
after
his
victory
at
calatafimi
garibaldi
moved
toward
palermo
the
capital
on
may
the
bourbon
troops
of
francis
ii
king
of
the
two
sicilies
marched
out
of
the
city
to
meet
him

shrewd
tactics

them
on
the
he
marched
on
palermo
with
about
three
thousand
men
and
attacked
the
city
on
the
the
battle
was
a
confused
struggle
of
military
and
civilians
many
citizens
of
palermo
armed
with
daggers
knives
spits
and
iron
instruments
of
any
kind
taking
part
in
favor
of
garibaldi
in
the
that
accompanied
the
more
regular
conflict
the
city
fell
through
revolt
of
the
people
and
defection
of
the
king
troops
rather
than
by
the
assaults
of
garibaldi
men
twenty
thousand
soldiers
of
despotism
capitulating
before
a
handful
of
citizens
in
the
cause
of
freedom
by
june
garibaldi
had
complete
possession
of

other
successes
in
his
famous
campaign

in

giuseppe
garibaldi
as
we
approached
the
western
coast
of
sicily
we
began
to
discover
and
steamers
on
the
roadstead
of
marsala
two
were
anchored
which
turned
out
to
be
english
having
decided
on
landing
at
marsala
we
approached
that
port
and
reached
it
about
noon
on
entering
the
harbor
we
found
it
full
of
of
different
nations
fortune
had
indeed
favored
us
and
so
guided
our
expedition
that
we
could
not
have
arrived
at
a
more
propitious
moment
the
bourbon
cruisers
had
left
the
harbor
of
marsala
that
morning
sailing
eastward
while
we
were
arriving
from
the
west
indeed
they
were
still
in
sight
toward
cape
san
marco
as
we
entered
so
that
by
the
time
they
came
within
we
had
already
landed
all
the
men
out
of
the
piemonte
and
were
beginning
to
debark
those
on
board
the
lombardo
the
presence
of
the
two
english
in
some
degree
influenced
the
determination
of
the
bourbon
commanders
who
were
naturally
impatient
to
open
fire
on
us
and
this
circumstance
gave
us
time
to
get
our
whole
force
on
shore
the
noble
english
flag
once
more
helped
to
prevent
bloodshed
and
i
the
benjamin
of
these
lords
of
the
ocean
was
for
the
hundredth
time
protected
by
them
the
assertion
however
made
by
our
enemies
that
the
english
had
directly
favored
and
assisted
our
landing
at
marsala
was
inaccurate
the
british
colors
flying
from
the
two
and
the
english
consulate
made
the
bourbon
mercenaries
hesitate
and
i
might
even
say
impressed
them
with
a
sense
of
shame
at
pouring
the
fire
of
their
imposing
batteries
into
a
handful
of
men
armed
only
with
the
kind
of
muskets
usually
supplied
by
the
government
to
italian
volunteers
notwithstanding
this
of
the
volunteers
were
still
on
the
quay
when
the
bourbons
began
firing
on
them
with
shells
and
happily
without
injury
to
anyone
the
piemonte
abandoned
by
us
was
carried
off
by
the
enemy
who
left
the
lombardo
which
had
grounded
on
a
the
population
of
marsala
thunderstruck
at
this
unexpected
event
received
us
pretty
well
all
things
considered
the
common
people
indeed
were
delighted
the
magnates
welcomed
us
under
protest
i
thought
all
this
very
natural
those
who
are
accustomed
to
calculate
everything
at
so
much
per
cent
are
not
likely
to
be
reassured
by
the
sight
of
a
few
desperadoes
who
wish
to
ameliorate
a
corrupt
society
by
eradicating
from
it
the
cancer
of
privilege
and
falsehood
especially
when
these
desperadoes
few
as
they
are
and
with
neither
nor
ironclads
fling
themselves
against
a
power
believed
to
be
gigantic
like
that
of
the
bourbon
men
of
high
rank
that
is
the
privileged
class
before
risking
anything
in
an
enterprise
wish
to
assure
themselves
which
way
the
wind
of
fortune
blows
and
where
the
large
battalions
are
and
then
the
victorious
force
may
be
certain
of
finding
them
compliant
cordial
and
even
enthusiastic
if
need
be
is
not
this
the
history
of
human
selfishness
in
every
country
the
poor
people
on
the
other
hand
welcomed
us
with
applause
and
with
unmistakable
tokens
of
affection
they
thought
of
nothing
but
the
sacredness
of
the
sacrifice
the
difficult
and
noble
task
undertaken
by
that
handful
of
gallant
young
fellows
who
had
come
from
such
a
distance
to
the
succor
of
their
brethren
we
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
the
following
night
at
marsala
where
i
began
to
profit
by
the
services
of
crispi
an
honest
and
capable
sicilian
who
was
of
the
greatest
use
to
me
in
government
business
and
in
making
all
necessary
arrangements
which
my
want
of
local
knowledge
prevented
my
doing
myself
a
dictatorship
was
spoken
of
and
i
accepted
it
without
hesitation
having
always
believed
it
the
plank
of
safety
in
urgent
cases
amid
the
breakers
in
which
nations
often
find
themselves
on
the
morning
of
the
the
thousand
footnote
garibaldi
landed
with
a
force
of
one
thousand
ed
left
for
salemi
but
the
distance
being
too
great
for
one
we
stopped
at
the
farm
of
mistretta
where
we
passed
the
night
we
did
not
find
the
proprietor
at
home
but
a
young
man
his
brother
did
the
honors
with
kindly
and
liberal
hospitality
at
mistretta
we
formed
a
new
company
under
griziotti
on
the
we
marched
to
salemi
where
we
were
well
received
by
the
people
and
were
joined
by
the
companies
of
sant
anna
and
some
other
volunteers
of
the
island
on
the
we
occupied
vita
or
san
vito
and
on
the
came
in
sight
of
the
enemy
who
occupying
calatafimi
and
knowing
of
our
approach
in
that
direction
had
spread
out
the
great
part
of
their
forces
on
the
heights
called
pianto
dei
the
dawn
of
may
found
us
in
good
order
on
the
heights
of
vita
and
a
little
later
the
enemy
whom
i
knew
to
be
at
calatafimi
left
the
city
in
column
marching
toward
us
the
hills
of
vita
are
confronted
by
the
heights
of
the
pianto
dei
romani
where
the
enemy
deployed
his
columns
on
the
calatafimi
side
these
heights
have
a
gentle
slope
easily
ascended
by
the
enemy
who
covered
all
the
highest
points
while
on
the
vita
side
they
are
steep
and
precipitous
occupying
the
opposite
and
southern
heights
i
had
been
able
to
perceive
exactly
all
the
positions
held
by
the
bourbonists
while
the
latter
could
scarcely
see
the
line
of
sharpshooters
formed
by
the
genoese
carbineers
under
mosto
who
covered
our
front
all
the
other
companies
being
drawn
up
behind
them
our
scanty
artillery
was
stationed
on
our
left
on
the
highroad
under
orsini
who
succeeded
in
spite
of
the
poverty
of
his
resources
in
making
a
few
good
shots
in
this
way
both
we
and
the
enemy
occupied
strong
positions
fronting
each
other
and
separated
by
a
wide
space
of
undulating
ground
broken
by
a
few
farmsteadings
our
advantage
therefore
clearly
lay
in
awaiting
the
enemy
in
our
own
position
the
bourbon
forces
to
the
number
of
about
two
thousand
with
some
cannon
discovering
a
few
of
our
men
without
distinguishing
uniform
and
mingled
with
peasants
boldly
advanced
a
few
lines
of
bersaglieri
with
sufficient
support
and
two
guns
arrived
within
firing
distance
they
opened
with
carbines
and
cannon
while
advancing
on
us
the
order
given
to
the
thousand
was
to
wait
without
firing
for
the
enemy
to
come
up
though
the
gallant
ligurians
already
had
one
man
killed
and
several
wounded
the
blare
of
the
bugles
sounding
an
american
brought
the
enemy
to
a
halt
as
if
by
magic
they
understood
that
it
was
not
the
picciotti
alone
they
had
to
deal
with
and
their
lines
with
the
artillery
gave
the
signal
for
a
retrograde
movement
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
soldiers
of
despotism
had
quailed
before
the
filibusters
for
such
was
the
title
with
which
our
enemies
honored
us
the
thousand
then
sounded
a
charge
the
genoese
carbineers
in
the
van
followed
by
a
chosen
band
of
youths
impatient
to
come
to
close
quarters
the
intention
of
the
charge
was
to
put
to
flight
the
enemy
vanguard
and
get
possession
of
the
two
guns
a
manoeuvre
that
was
executed
with
a
spirit
worthy
of
the
champions
of
italian
liberty
but
i
had
no
intention
of
a
front
attack
on
a
formidable
position
occupied
by
a
strong
force
of
bourbon
troops
but
who
could
stop
those
fiery
and
impetuous
volunteers
in
their
rush
on
the
foe
in
vain
the
trumpets
sounded
a
halt
our
men
did
not
hear
or
imitated
nelson
conduct
at
the
battle
of
copenhagen
they
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
order
to
halt
sounded
by
the
trumpets
and
with
their
bayonets
drove
the
enemy
van
back
on
their
main
body
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
or
that
gallant
handful
would
have
perished
immediately
a
general
charge
was
sounded
and
the
entire
corps
of
the
thousand
accompanied
by
some
courageous
sicilians
and
calabrese
marched
at
a
quick
pace
to
the
rescue
the
enemy
had
abandoned
the
plain
but
falling
back
on
the
heights
where
their
reserve
was
held
firm
and
defended
their
position
with
a
dogged
valor
worthy
of
a
better
cause
the
most
dangerous
part
of
the
ground
we
had
to
cross
was
the
level
valley
separating
us
from
the
enemy
where
we
had
to
face
a
storm
of
and
which
wounded
a
good
many
of
our
men
arrived
at
the
foot
of
monte
romano
we
were
almost
sheltered
from
attack
and
at
this
point
the
thousand
somewhat
diminished
in
number
closed
up
to
the
vanguard
the
situation
was
supreme
we
were
bound
to
win
in
this
determination
we
began
to
ascend
the
first
ledge
of
the
mountain
under
a
hail
of
bullets
i
do
not
remember
how
many
but
there
were
certainly
several
terraces
to
be
gained
before
reaching
the
crest
of
the
heights
and
every
time
we
climbed
from
one
terrace
to
the
next
during
which
operation
we
were
totally
unprotected
we
were
under
a
tremendous
fire
the
orders
given
to
our
men
to
fire
but
few
shots
were
well
adapted
to
the
wretched
weapons
presented
to
us
by
the
sardinian
government
which
nearly
always
missed
fire
on
this
occasion
too
great
service
was
rendered
by
the
gallant
genoese
who
being
excellent
shots
and
armed
with
good
carbines
sustained
the
honor
of
our
cause
this
ought
to
be
an
encouragement
to
all
young
italians
to
exercise
themselves
in
the
use
of
arms
in
the
conviction
that
valor
alone
is
not
enough
on
modern
battlefields
great
dexterity
in
the
use
of
weapons
is
also
necessary
calatafimi
the
survivor
of
a
hundred
battles
if
in
my
last
moments
my
friends
see
me
smile
once
more
with
pride
it
will
be
at
the
recollection
of
that
fight
for
i
remember
none
more
glorious
the
thousand
attired
just
as
at
home
worthy
representatives
of
their
people
attacked
with
heroic
coolness
fighting
their
way
from
one
formidable
position
to
another
the
soldiers
of
tyranny
brilliant
in
gaudily
trimmed
uniforms
gold
lace
and
epaulettes
and
completely
routed
them
how
can
i
forget
that
knot
of
youths
who
fearing
to
see
me
wounded
surrounded
me
pressing
themselves
closely
together
and
sheltering
me
with
their
bodies
if
while
i
write
i
am
deeply
touched
at
the
recollection
i
have
good
reason
is
it
not
my
duty
at
least
to
remind
italy
of
those
brave
sons
of
hers
who
fell
there
montanari
schiaffino
sertorio
nullo
vigo
tukery
taddei
and
many
more
whose
names
i
grieve
to
say
i
can
not
remember
as
i
have
already
said
the
southern
slope
of
monte
romano
which
we
had
to
ascend
was
formed
of
those
ledges
or
narrow
terraces
used
by
the
cultivators
of
the
soil
in
mountainous
countries
we
made
all
possible
haste
to
reach
the
bank
of
each
terrace
driving
the
enemy
before
us
and
then
halting
under
cover
of
the
bank
to
take
breath
and
prepare
for
the
attack
proceeding
thus
we
gained
one
ledge
after
another
till
we
reached
the
top
where
the
bourbon
troops
made
a
last
effort
defending
their
position
with
great
intrepidity
many
of
their
chasseurs
who
had
come
to
the
end
of
their
ammunition
even
throwing
down
stones
on
us
at
last
we
gave
the
final
charge
the
bravest
of
the
thousand
massed
together
under
the
last
bank
after
taking
breath
and
measuring
with
their
eye
the
space
yet
to
be
traversed
before
crossing
swords
with
the
enemy
rushed
on
like
lions
confident
of
victory
and
trusting
in
their
sacred
cause
the
bourbon
force
could
not
resist
the
terrible
onset
of
men
fighting
for
freedom
they
fled
and
never
stopped
till
they
reached
the
town
of
calatafimi
several
miles
from
the
battlefield
we
ceased
our
pursuit
a
short
distance
from
the
entrance
to
the
town
which
is
very
strongly
situated
if
one
gives
battle
one
ought
to
be
sure
of
victory
this
axiom
is
very
true
under
all
circumstances
but
especially
at
the
beginning
of
a
campaign
the
victory
of
calatafimi
though
of
slight
importance
as
regards
acquisitions
for
we
took
only
one
cannon
a
few
rifles
and
a
few
prisoners
had
an
immeasurable
moral
result
in
encouraging
the
population
and
demoralizing
the
hostile
army
the
handful
of
filibusters
without
gold
lace
or
epaulettes
who
were
spoken
of
with
such
solemn
contempt
had
routed
several
thousand
of
the
bourbon
best
troops
artillery
and
all
commanded
by
one
of
those
generals
who
like
lucullus
are
ready
to
spend
the
revenue
of
a
province
on
one
supper
one
corps
of
citizens
not
to
say
filibusters
animated
by
love
of
their
country
can
therefore
gain
a
victory
unaided
by
all
this
needless
splendor
the
first
important
result
was
the
enemy
retreat
from
calatafimi
which
town
we
occupied
on
the
following
morning
may
the
second
result
and
one
abundantly
noteworthy
was
the
attack
made
by
the
population
of
partinicio
borgetto
montelepre
and
other
places
on
the
retreating
army
in
every
place
volunteer
companies
were
formed
which
speedily
joined
us
and
the
enthusiasm
in
the
surrounding
villages
reached
its
height
the
disbanded
troops
of
the
enemy
did
not
stop
till
they
reached
palermo
where
they
brought
terror
to
the
bourbon
party
and
confidence
to
the
patriots
our
wounded
and
those
of
the
enemy
were
brought
in
to
vita
and
calatafimi
among
ours
were
some
men
who
could
ill
be
spared
montanari
my
comrade
at
rome
and
in
lombardy
was
dangerously
wounded
and
died
a
few
days
after
he
was
one
of
those
whom
doctrinaires
call
demagogues
because
they
are
impatient
of
servitude
love
their
country
and
refuse
to
bow
the
knee
to
the
caprices
and
vices
of
the
great
montanari
was
a
modenese
schiaffino
a
young
ligurian
from
camogli
who
had
also
served
in
the
cacciatori
delle
alpi
and
in
the
guides
was
among
the
first
to
fall
on
the
field
bereaving
italy
of
one
of
her
bravest
soldiers
he
worked
hard
on
the
night
of
our
start
from
genoa
and
greatly
assisted
bixio
in
that
delicate
undertaking
de
amici
also
of
the
cacciatori
and
guides
was
another
who
fell
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle
not
a
few
of
the
chosen
band
of
the
thousand
fell
at
calatafimi
as
our
roman
forefathers
fell
rushing
on
the
enemy
with
cold
steel
cut
down
in
front
without
a
complaint
without
a
cry
except
that
of
viva
i
may
have
seen
battles
more
desperate
and
more
obstinately
contested
but
in
none
have
i
seen
finer
soldiers
than
my
citizen
filibusters
of
calatafimi
the
victory
of
calatafimi
was
indisputably
the
decisive
battle
in
the
brilliant
campaign
of
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
begin
the
expedition
with
some
striking
engagement
such
as
this
which
so
demoralized
the
enemy
that
their
fervent
southern
imaginations
even
exaggerated
the
valor
of
the
thousand
there
were
some
among
them
who
declared
they
had
seen
the
bullets
of
their
carbines
rebound
from
the
breasts
of
the
soldiers
of
liberty
as
if
from
a
plate
of
bronze
far
more
men
were
killed
and
wounded
at
palermo
milazzo
and
the
volturno
but
still
i
believe
calatafimi
to
have
been
the
decisive
battle
after
a
fight
like
that
our
men
knew
they
were
bound
to
win
and
the
gallant
sicilians
whose
courage
had
been
previously
shaken
by
the
imposing
numbers
and
superior
equipment
of
the
bourbon
force
were
encouraged
when
a
battle
begins
with
such
prestige
with
omens
drawn
from
such
a
precedent
victory
is
sure
john
webb
probyn
on
june
about
three
weeks
after
garibaldi
had
taken
possession
of
palermo
francis
ii
solemnly
announced
his
intention
to
give
a
constitution
to
the
kingdom
of
the
two
sicilies
adopt
the
italian
flag
and
ally
himself
with
sardinia
these
promises
only
provoked
the
cry
of
too
late
they
did
but
recall
how
often
the
neapolitan
bourbons
had
promised
in
the
hour
of
danger
and
proved
faithless
to
every
promise
when
the
danger
was
passed
victor
emmanuel
and
his
government
were
now
both
unable
and
unwilling
to
agree
to
any
such
terms
with
a
sovereign
who
had
rejected
similar
offers
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
when
such
a
settlement
was
possible
every
friend
of
freedom
felt
that
the
time
had
gone
by
for
any
common
action
between
the
houses
of
savoy
and
bourbon
each
had
taken
its
own
line
of
action
and
each
was
now
to
abide
by
the
result
garibaldi
had
overthrown
the
neapolitan
rule
in
sicily
and
raised
the
cry
of
italy
and
victor
emmanuel
which
found
a
hearty
response
having
been
so
successful
he
now
determined
despite
the
warnings
of
friendly
advisers
and
the
hostility
of
enemies
to
carry
his
forces
from
sicily
to
the
mainland
and
take
possession
of
naples
itself
he
was
at
the
head
of
about
twenty
thousand
men
under
the
command
of
generals
medici
bixio
cosenz
and
turr
he
had
also
the
prestige
of
victory
mingled
with
a
kind
of
legendary
fame
which
continually
increased
these
were
formidable
aids
to
further
success
especially
when
brought
to
bear
on
the
fervid
feelings
and
imagination
of
a
southern
people
francis
of
naples
still
possessed
an
army
of
eighty
thousand
men
of
which
he
despatched
more
than
twenty
thousand
to
arrest
if
possible
the
progress
of
his
formidable
opponent
victor
emmanuel
sought
to
dissuade
garibaldi
from
an
enterprise
so
full
of
danger
as
that
of
marching
upon
naples
against
the
wishes
of
the
united
cabinets
of
continental
europe
the
king
desired
that
matters
should
proceed
by
negotiation
the
basis
of
which
should
be
that
neapolitans
and
sicilians
should
be
allowed
to
decide
their
future
destinies
for
themselves
garibaldi
who
loved
and
trusted
the
honest
king
replied
that
the
actual
state
of
italy
compelled
him
to
disobey
his
majesty
when
said
the
patriot
i
shall
have
delivered
the
populations
from
the
yoke
that
weighs
them
down
i
will
throw
my
sword
at
your
feet
and
will
then
obey
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
in
truth
italians
of
all
ranks
were
now
so
roused
that
neither
victor
emmanuel
cavour
nor
even
garibaldi
himself
could
have
stayed
the
movement
the
overpowering
strength
of
foreign
armies
could
alone
have
put
it
down
circumstances
however
happily
prevented
so
gross
an
abuse
of
mere
force
for
once
italians
were
allowed
to
do
as
they
wished
in
their
own
country
instead
of
being
compelled
by
foreign
powers
to
do
as
those
powers
commanded
many
things
concurred
to
bring
about
this
result
the
french
emperor
had
just
received
savoy
and
nice
he
had
been
spending
the
blood
and
treasure
of
france
in
giving
the
first
blow
to
the
old
despotisms
of
italy
how
could
he
now
fly
in
the
face
of
his
own
principle
of
the
national
will
in
order
to
save
the
worst
of
those
despotisms
he
could
not
declare
that
sicilians
and
neapolitans
should
not
dare
have
the
opportunity
of
doing
what
he
had
at
last
permitted
in
central
italy
and
profited
by
in
nice
and
savoy
to
have
allowed
austria
to
do
so
would
be
to
stultify
himself
in
the
eyes
of
europe
to
enrage
italians
and
to
lead
france
to
ask
what
was
the
use
of
calling
on
her
to
make
sacrifices
for
the
overthrow
of
austrian
domination
in
the
peninsula
if
within
a
few
months
that
domination
was
to
be
in
a
large
measure
restored
austria
too
had
her
own
difficulties
to
encounter
and
they
were
both
numerous
and
complicated
her
military
and
priestly
despotism
had
suffered
defeat
her
people
disliked
its
rule
and
desired
freer
institutions
her
finances
were
terribly
disordered
the
emperor
was
beginning
to
see
the
necessity
of
a
change
of
system
a
change
by
no
means
easy
to
effect
for
the
hungarians
were
demanding
the
restoration
of
their
ancient
constitutional
rights
russia
and
prussia
contented
themselves
with
protests
which
had
it
may
be
some
diplomatic
value
but
were
wholly
without
practical
effect
england
was
favorable
to
the
extension
of
italian
liberties
and
france
was
her
ally
in
syria
and
in
china
so
it
was
that
garibaldi
having
only
to
encounter
the
naval
and
military
forces
of
francis
ii
crossed
the
straits
of
messina
landed
in
calabria
and
marched
on
reggio
on
august
the
town
was
occupied
and
the
citadel
with
its
commander
and
soldiers
capitulated
another
victory
was
gained
on
the
dispersing
the
forces
of
the
neapolitan
generals
melendez
and
briganti
some
of
their
soldiers
joined
garibaldi
the
rest
returned
to
their
homes
and
increased
both
his
real
and
his
legendary
fame
by
their
account
of
his
victories
the
insurrection
against
the
bourbon
dynasty
was
now
rapidly
spreading
at
cosenza
in
calabria
and
at
potenza
in
the
basilicata
provisional
governments
were
proclaimed
and
were
hailing
with
delight
the
progress
of
garibaldi
the
forces
of
francis
were
disappearing
from
those
provinces
and
leaving
the
road
to
naples
unprotected
the
fleet
was
as
little
to
be
counted
on
as
the
army
in
naples
itself
all
was
confusion
and
contradiction
in
the
government
none
of
its
members
trusted
the
others
or
believed
in
the
duration
of
the
bourbon
dynasty
years
of
corruption
tyranny
falsehood
and
cruelty
had
undermined
the
whole
system
and
it
fell
before
the
storm
as
if
by
magic
francis
ii
determined
to
leave
his
capital
when
he
ordered
the
troops
which
still
remained
faithful
to
him
to
retreat
upon
capua
and
gaeta
of
the
staff
sent
in
their
resignation
as
did
many
of
the
officers
of
the
neapolitan
fleet
the
king
addressed
a
protest
to
the
foreign
powers
in
which
he
declared
he
only
quitted
his
capital
to
save
it
from
the
horrors
of
a
siege
he
issued
a
proclamation
to
his
people
in
which
he
expressed
his
wishes
for
their
happiness
and
declared
that
when
restored
to
his
throne
it
would
be
all
the
more
splendid
from
the
institutions
he
had
now
irrevocably
given
on
september
he
left
the
capital
on
board
a
steamer
accompanied
by
two
spanish
frigates
and
was
taken
to
gaeta
on
september
garibaldi
entered
naples
at
midday
in
an
open
carriage
accompanied
by
some
of
his
staff
for
long
hours
he
received
a
welcome
such
as
has
seldom
if
ever
been
given
to
any
other
man
again
and
again
he
had
to
appear
on
the
balcony
of
the
palazzo
where
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
to
receive
the
applause
of
the
multitude
at
eight
that
evening
it
was
at
length
announced
that
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
emotion
he
had
retired
to
rest
a
sudden
quiet
fell
upon
the
vast
crowds
and
repeating
to
one
another
our
father
sleeps
they
dispersed
to
their
homes
their
right
hands
raised
above
their
heads
with
the
first
finger
alone
extended
a
sign
expressive
of
the
cry
reiterated
again
and
again
that
day
one
italy
on
september
garibaldi
issued
a
proclamation
to
his
soldiers
headed
italy
and
victor
emmanuel
in
it
the
general
called
upon
them
to
aid
him
in
carrying
to
a
successful
termination
the
work
so
well
begun
nor
did
he
hesitate
to
declare
that
rome
must
be
italian
and
the
line
of
the
alps
the
frontier
of
italy
he
addressed
another
proclamation
to
the
people
in
which
he
especially
called
on
them
to
be
united
the
first
need
of
italy
is
concord
in
order
to
realize
the
union
of
the
great
italian
family
providence
has
given
us
this
concord
since
all
the
provinces
are
unanimous
and
labor
with
magnanimous
zeal
at
the
national
reconstruction
as
to
unity
providence
has
further
given
us
victor
emmanuel
a
model
sovereign
who
will
inculcate
in
his
descendants
the
duties
which
they
should
fulfil
for
the
happiness
of
a
people
who
have
chosen
him
as
their
chief
with
enthusiastic
homage
the
proclamation
went
on
to
speak
with
kindly
warmth
of
those
italian
priests
who
had
sided
with
the
national
cause
and
declared
that
such
conduct
was
a
sure
means
of
gaining
respect
for
their
mission
and
work
repeating
again
the
demand
for
concord
the
concluding
words
justly
protested
against
all
foreign
interference
finally
be
it
known
we
respect
the
houses
of
others
but
we
insist
upon
being
masters
in
our
own
whether
it
please
or
displease
the
rulers
of
the
earth
garibaldi
united
the
neapolitan
to
the
sardinian
fleet
so
forming
an
italian
naval
force
he
appointed
a
ministry
comprising
liborio
romano
who
had
served
under
francis
ii
scialoia
cosenz
and
pisanelli
he
then
proceeded
to
promulgate
the
sardinian
constitution
throughout
the
neapolitan
provinces
but
the
bourbon
forces
were
still
in
possession
of
capua
and
gaeta
it
became
necessary
therefore
to
undertake
military
operations
against
them
meanwhile
the
agitation
in
the
papal
provinces
was
increasing
the
pope
government
had
refused
to
modify
its
policy
or
agree
to
any
reduction
of
its
territory
it
accepted
the
protection
of
france
in
rome
and
its
immediate
neighborhood
but
declined
further
aid
as
it
was
raising
forces
of
its
own
under
a
french
general
lamoricière
these
soldiers
were
men
of
various
european
nationalities
belonging
to
that
roman
catholic
party
which
was
determined
to
maintain
intact
the
temporal
rule
of
the
pope
as
against
the
wishes
of
the
vast
majority
of
italians
themselves
roman
catholics
who
desired
to
substitute
for
that
rule
the
constitutional
sovereignty
of
king
victor
emmanuel
the
italians
were
willing
enough
to
remain
under
the
spiritual
headship
of
the
roman
pontiff
but
they
would
not
have
a
temporal
power
upheld
by
foreign
soldiers
the
moment
was
like
many
others
a
very
critical
one
in
the
history
of
italy
garibaldi
was
victorious
in
naples
the
papal
forces
composed
chiefly
of
germans
and
french
under
lamoricière
were
holding
the
inhabitants
of
umbria
and
the
marches
who
were
longing
to
join
the
national
movement
indeed
some
of
the
most
influential
men
of
those
provinces
among
others
marquis
filippo
gualterio
of
orvieto
had
already
come
to
turin
to
obtain
the
intervention
of
its
government
and
protection
from
the
papal
troops
whose
foreign
extraction
rendered
them
odious
to
the
people
on
september
count
delia
minerva
was
sent
to
rome
to
demand
on
the
part
of
victor
emmanuel
the
disbandment
of
the
foreign
troops
which
the
papal
government
had
got
together
under
the
command
of
general
lamoricière
the
demand
was
refused
this
refusal
the
papal
government
was
quite
competent
to
give
but
whether
its
policy
in
upholding
its
temporal
power
by
the
aid
of
foreign
mercenaries
was
wise
or
not
was
another
matter
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
italians
any
more
than
frenchmen
germans
or
english
would
endure
such
a
state
of
things
if
they
could
prevent
it
the
government
of
turin
now
ordered
its
troops
to
enter
the
papal
provinces
of
umbria
and
the
marches
on
september
general
fanti
crossed
the
frontier
easily
took
possession
of
perugia
with
the
aid
of
the
inhabitants
and
obliged
colonel
schmidt
the
papal
commander
to
capitulate
the
general
advanced
with
equal
success
against
spoleto
and
in
a
few
days
was
master
of
all
the
upper
valley
of
the
tiber
at
the
same
time
general
cialdini
operating
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
apennines
marched
rapidly
to
meet
general
forces
which
he
encountered
and
defeated
completely
at
castelfidardo
compelling
the
french
general
to
fly
to
ancona
which
he
entered
in
company
with
only
a
few
horsemen
who
had
escaped
with
him
from
the
rout
of
the
papal
army
the
italian
fleet
was
off
ancona
before
which
general
cialdini
troops
now
appeared
thus
completely
preventing
the
escape
of
lamoricière
who
was
obliged
to
surrender
in
less
than
three
weeks
the
campaign
was
over
the
sardinian
troops
having
thus
occupied
umbria
and
the
marches
proceeded
to
cross
into
the
neapolitan
provinces
and
march
upon
capua
and
gaeta
austria
prussia
and
russia
protested
against
the
course
thus
pursued
by
the
government
of
victor
emmanuel
the
pope
excommunicated
all
who
had
participated
in
the
invasion
of
his
territory
francis
ii
protested
with
no
less
earnestness
the
emperor
of
the
french
withdrew
his
minister
from
turin
and
blamed
the
proceedings
of
victor
emmanuel
government
but
in
other
respects
napoleon
remained
a
passive
spectator
of
all
that
occurred
and
maintained
the
principle
of
at
least
as
regarded
umbria
and
the
marches
sicily
and
naples
excepting
at
gaeta
where
his
fleet
prevented
for
a
time
any
attack
being
made
against
that
fortress
from
the
sea
he
also
raised
the
number
of
his
troops
in
rome
and
the
province
in
which
it
is
situated
called
the
patrimony
of
peter
to
thousand
men
this
was
now
all
the
territory
left
to
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
napoleon
determined
to
preserve
that
much
to
the
roman
see
defending
it
from
the
attacks
of
garibaldi
and
forbidding
its
annexation
to
the
kingdom
of
italy
the
english
government
however
decidedly
vindicated
the
course
taken
under
the
circumstances
by
victor
emmanuel
and
his
advisers
lord
russell
who
was
secretary
of
foreign
affairs
under
lord
palmerston
wrote
on
october
an
admirable
despatch
to
sir
james
hudson
the
english
minister
at
turin
who
was
allowed
to
give
a
copy
of
it
to
count
cavour
in
that
despatch
lord
russell
gives
good
reasons
for
dissenting
from
the
views
expressed
by
the
governments
of
austria
prussia
russia
and
france
he
justifies
the
action
of
the
government
of
turin
admits
that
italians
themselves
are
the
best
judges
of
their
own
interests
shows
how
in
times
past
they
vainly
attempted
regularly
and
temperately
to
reform
their
governments
says
such
attempts
were
put
down
by
foreign
powers
and
concludes
by
declaring
that
her
government
will
turn
their
eyes
rather
to
the
gratifying
prospect
of
a
people
building
up
the
edifice
of
their
liberties
and
consolidating
the
work
of
their
independence
amid
the
sympathies
and
good
wishes
of
europe
it
is
gratifying
to
remember
that
at
this
very
critical
juncture
in
the
cause
of
italian
unity
and
independence
the
english
government
gave
its
very
cordial
support
to
that
cause
and
ably
defended
the
course
pursued
by
king
victor
emmanuel
his
ministers
and
his
people
the
cause
of
italian
unity
and
independence
had
indeed
made
prodigious
strides
due
not
only
to
the
marvellous
victories
of
garibaldi
which
had
brought
him
in
four
months
from
marsala
to
naples
but
also
to
the
skilful
campaigns
of
generals
fanti
and
cialdini
in
umbria
and
the
marches
cavour
now
followed
up
these
successes
by
advising
a
course
calculated
to
give
them
consistency
and
endurance
he
counselled
the
immediate
assembling
of
parliament
the
acceptance
by
victor
emmanuel
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
papal
neapolitan
and
sicilian
provinces
if
such
were
the
will
of
their
inhabitants
and
the
departure
of
the
king
from
turin
to
take
the
command
of
his
troops
now
advancing
toward
capua
victor
emmanuel
entirely
agreed
with
his
minister
advice
on
october
cavour
asked
parliament
for
full
powers
to
annex
all
the
new
provinces
of
central
and
southern
italy
if
they
desired
it
he
contended
that
the
events
which
had
taken
place
were
due
to
the
initiative
of
the
people
the
noble
audacity
of
general
garibaldi
and
the
constitutional
rule
of
victor
emmanuel
united
to
his
devotion
to
the
cause
of
italian
freedom
even
those
deputies
who
represented
the
views
of
the
extreme
left
some
of
whose
members
avowed
a
preference
for
republicanism
in
theory
at
any
rate
supported
the
government
one
of
them
signor
bertani
declared
he
would
not
now
raise
any
point
of
difference
and
frankly
acknowledged
that
in
reality
all
italians
wished
the
same
thing
italy
one
and
free
under
victor
emmanuel
cavour
further
satisfied
the
chamber
by
saying
that
rome
and
venice
must
in
the
end
be
united
to
the
mother
country
though
the
questions
involved
in
such
union
must
out
of
deference
to
europe
and
france
be
postponed
for
the
present
a
vote
of
two
hundred
ninety
against
six
confirmed
the
policy
of
the
government
and
gave
full
expression
to
the
wishes
of
the
country
garibaldi
had
in
the
mean
time
pushed
on
his
forces
from
naples
toward
capua
and
the
line
of
the
river
volturno
on
september
his
troops
took
caiazzo
from
which
however
they
were
dislodged
on
the
of
the
month
after
this
success
francis
ii
determined
to
take
the
offensive
and
attack
in
force
the
garibaldian
lines
with
the
object
of
driving
them
back
to
naples
or
cutting
them
off
from
that
city
this
attempt
was
well
planned
and
conducted
on
october
the
struggle
was
hotly
maintained
on
both
sides
throughout
the
day
some
companies
of
bersaglieri
arrived
from
naples
and
united
in
resisting
the
attacks
of
the
bourbon
troops
who
were
in
the
end
repelled
and
compelled
to
retire
but
though
beaten
they
had
fought
well
and
still
held
the
fortresses
of
gaeta
and
capua
to
which
they
had
retreated
the
army
of
victor
emmanuel
however
led
by
the
king
in
person
was
now
rapidly
advancing
easily
overcoming
whatever
resistance
the
bourbon
troops
were
able
to
offer
francis
ii
unable
to
prevent
the
junction
of
the
forces
with
those
of
garibaldi
withdrew
with
the
bulk
of
his
soldiers
to
gaeta
leaving
four
thousand
men
in
capua
who
were
soon
obliged
to
capitulate
on
october
victor
emmanuel
and
garibaldi
met
near
the
little
town
of
teano
they
greeted
each
other
with
great
cordiality
for
though
garibaldi
had
little
faith
in
ministers
or
diplomatists
and
could
not
forgive
their
cession
of
nice
to
france
he
felt
the
utmost
confidence
in
the
king
himself
victor
emmanuel
on
his
part
had
the
greatest
regard
for
the
heroic
patriot
who
had
ever
been
so
devoted
to
his
cause
and
whose
marvellous
exploits
had
now
given
freedom
to
sicily
and
naples
as
they
grasped
each
other
hands
garibaldi
cried
behold
the
king
of
italy
long
live
the
king
the
soldiers
of
both
leaders
shouted
long
live
victor
emmanuel
king
of
italy
on
november
the
king
entered
naples
with
garibaldi
at
his
side
the
reception
was
enthusiastic
in
the
extreme
it
reached
its
culminating
point
as
victor
emmanuel
entered
the
royal
palace
long
had
it
been
the
abode
of
those
who
hated
and
betrayed
both
constitutional
liberty
and
national
freedom
now
it
was
taken
possession
of
by
one
who
had
risked
life
and
crown
in
their
cause
the
king
issued
a
proclamation
in
which
he
called
to
mind
the
increased
responsibilities
which
fell
henceforth
upon
himself
and
his
people
alike
nor
did
he
fail
to
remind
them
of
the
necessity
for
union
and
abnegation
all
parties
must
bow
before
the
majesty
of
italy
which
god
has
raised
up
we
must
establish
a
government
which
gives
guarantees
of
liberty
to
the
people
and
of
severe
probity
to
the
public
at
large
in
the
succeeding
days
his
majesty
received
the
deputations
of
the
newly
acquired
provinces
of
umbria
the
marches
naples
and
sicily
which
came
to
present
to
him
officially
the
result
of
the
plebiscite
by
which
the
inhabitants
of
those
provinces
declared
their
wish
to
be
united
to
the
rest
of
the
king
dominions
and
so
form
a
single
kingdom
of
italy
many
other
receptions
there
were
of
societies
belonging
to
several
ranks
and
classes
of
men
particularly
impressive
was
the
welcome
given
to
the
deputation
which
came
from
the
senate
and
chamber
at
turin
in
honor
of
so
great
an
event
as
the
union
of
southern
with
northern
italy
under
the
constitutional
rule
of
one
sovereign
on
december
victor
emmanuel
embarked
for
palermo
where
he
was
received
with
an
enthusiasm
at
least
as
great
as
that
which
marked
his
arrival
in
naples
in
the
capital
of
sicily
all
orders
of
citizens
pressed
forward
to
pay
him
their
willing
homage
these
great
results
were
not
however
achieved
without
difficulty
for
there
was
considerable
diversity
of
opinion
and
not
a
little
jealousy
between
those
that
surrounded
garibaldi
and
those
that
followed
the
lead
of
cavour
in
parliament
and
in
the
country
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
faults
and
mistakes
may
fairly
be
laid
to
the
charge
of
both
those
parties
despite
their
sincere
attachment
to
the
cause
of
their
common
fatherland
a
mistake
was
made
by
garibaldi
himself
when
he
wished
to
postpone
the
immediate
annexation
of
the
southern
provinces
to
the
northern
kingdom
and
asked
to
be
named
dictator
of
naples
for
two
years
by
victor
emmanuel
whom
he
further
requested
to
dismiss
cavour
and
his
actual
advisers
the
king
rightly
refused
to
agree
to
a
course
so
subversive
of
all
constitutional
proceedings
and
liberties
he
could
not
even
entertain
the
idea
of
dismissing
ministers
at
the
request
of
any
citizen
however
illustrious
or
however
great
the
services
he
had
rendered
his
country
it
was
for
the
national
representatives
alone
to
decide
to
what
minister
the
king
should
give
his
confidence
and
what
course
should
be
taken
as
to
the
annexation
of
naples
and
sicily
garibaldi
good
sense
and
honesty
of
purpose
led
him
to
give
in
to
the
king
judgment
victor
emmanuel
took
the
right
view
of
the
course
to
be
pursued
in
this
matter
just
as
he
had
taken
the
right
view
of
the
course
to
be
pursued
at
the
moment
of
the
peace
of
villafranca
in
the
one
case
he
showed
himself
wiser
than
cavour
and
in
the
other
wiser
than
garibaldi
the
patriotism
of
the
latter
and
the
statesmanship
of
the
former
combined
with
the
remarkably
sure
judgment
and
unfailing
honesty
of
the
king
gradually
overcame
all
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
victor
emmanuel
ever
kept
aloof
from
political
coteries
while
deferring
to
the
advice
of
his
responsible
ministers
so
long
as
they
had
the
confidence
of
parliament
he
ever
showed
himself
to
be
the
head
of
the
nation
not
the
head
of
a
party
his
unswerving
determination
to
be
guided
by
the
nation
will
as
expressed
by
the
nation
chosen
representatives
though
nothing
new
in
his
career
won
for
him
the
absolute
confidence
of
all
italians
not
one
of
whom
avowed
it
more
frankly
than
garibaldi
himself
but
what
shall
be
said
of
the
popular
hero
sprung
from
the
ranks
of
the
people
who
had
given
a
kingdom
to
his
sovereign
rarely
if
ever
has
history
recorded
nobler
conduct
than
that
of
the
conqueror
of
sicily
and
naples
when
having
liberated
those
provinces
he
laid
down
all
power
refused
all
honors
turned
away
alike
wealth
and
titles
to
betake
himself
to
his
island
home
of
caprera
there
to
work
with
his
own
hands
to
rejoice
as
he
thought
of
how
greatly
he
had
advanced
the
independence
of
italy
and
to
pray
for
the
hour
of
its
completion
whatever
defects
may
be
found
in
the
character
or
judgment
of
this
heroic
patriot
his
name
will
assuredly
be
held
in
grateful
remembrance
wherever
men
are
found
who
love
freedom
and
rejoice
as
they
see
its
blessings
spread
more
and
more
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
as
garibaldi
retired
to
his
quiet
abode
in
caprera
victor
emmanuel
returned
to
his
duties
in
turin
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
forgot
rome
and
venice
the
siege
of
gaeta

forward
with

determination
the

was
defended
with
courage

endurance
by
francis
ii
and
his
queen
for
a
time
the
french
fleet
prevented
the
italians
from
attacking
gaeta
by

but
when

withdrew
his

further
resistance
became

on

gaeta
surrendered

a
defence
of
which
those
who
took

in
it
had
a
right
to
be
proud
the

marched
out
with

retained
their

francis

embarked
for

in

the

was
put

the

nominated
as
suggested
by
his
responsible
advisers
sixty
new

house
they
were
selected
chiefly
among
the
most
prominent

influential

were

formation
of
the
single
kingdom
of
italy
under
the

footnote
it
was
almost
ten
years
later
when
victor
emmanuel
entered
rome
september
that
the
emancipation
and
union
of
italy
were
made
ed
emancipation
of
russian
serfs
andrew

and
nikolai
turgenieff
by
the
act
that
freed
the
serfs
in
russia
alexander
ii
to
whom
it
was
in
great
measure
due
obtained
a
place
of
unusual
honor
among
the
sovereigns
that
have
ruled
his
nation
it
was
the
grand
achievement
of
alexander
reign
and
caused
him
to
be
hailed
as
one
of
the
liberators
the
importance
of
this
event
in
russian
history
is
not
diminished
by
the
fact
that
its
practical
benefits
have
not
as
yet
been
realized
to
the
full
extent
anticipated
in
stepniak
the
russian
author
and
reformer
declared
that
emancipation
had
utterly
failed
to
realize
the
ardent
expectations
of
its
advocates
and
promoters
had
failed
to
improve
the
material
condition
of
the
former
serfs
who
on
the
whole
were
worse
off
than
before
emancipation
the
same
assertion
has
been
made
with
respect
to
the
emancipation
of
slaves
in
the
united
states
but
in
neither
case
does
the
objection
invalidate
the
historical
significance
of
an
act
that
formally
liberated
millions
of
human
beings
from
hereditary
and
legalized
bondage
in
the
two
views
here
presented
the
subject
of
the

in

is
considered

various
aspects

scholar
and

nikolai
turgenieff
the
russian
historian
writing
while
the
emancipation
act
was
bearing
its
first
fruits
describes
its
workings
and
effects
as
observed
by
one
intimately
connected
with
the
serfs
and
the
movement
that
resulted
in
their
freedom
andrew
white
close
upon
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
muscovite
ideas
of
right
were
subjected
to
the
strong
mind
of
ivan
the
great
and
compressed
into
a
code
therein
were
embodied
the
best
processes
known
to
his
land
and
time
for
discovering
crime
torture
and
trial
by
battle
for
punishing
crime
the
knout
and
death
but
hidden
in
this
tough
mass
was
one
law
of
greater
import
than
others
thereby
were
all
peasants
forbidden
to
leave
the
lands
they
were
then
tilling
except
during
the
eight
days
before
and
after
george
day
this
provision
sprang
from
ivan
highest
views
of
justice
and
broadest
views
of
political
economy
the
nobles
received
it
with
plaudits
which
have
found
echoes
even
in
these
days
the
peasants
received
it
with
no
murmurs
which
history
has
found
any
trouble
in
drowning
just
one
hundred
years
later
upon
the
muscovite
throne
as
nominal
czar
sat
the
weakling
feodor
i
but
behind
the
throne
stood
as
real
czar
hard
strong
boris
godunoff
looking
forward
to
feodor
death
boris
made
ready
to
mount
the
throne
and
he
saw
what
all
other
mayors
of
the
palace
climbing
into
the
places
of
kings
have
seen
that
he
must
link
to
his
fortunes
the
fortunes
of
some
strong
body
in
the
nation
he
broke
however
from
the
general
rule
among
usurpers
bribing
the
church
and
determined
to
bribe
the
nobility
the
greatest
grief
of
the
muscovite
nobles
seemed
to
be
that
the
peasants
could
escape
from
their
oppression
by
the
emigration
allowed
on
george
day
boris
saw
his
opportunity
he
cut
off
the
privilege
of
george
day
and
the
peasant
was
fixed
to
the
soil
forever
no
russian
law
ever
directly
enslaved
the
peasantry
but
through
this
decree
of
boris
the
lord
who
owned
the
soil
came
to
own
the
peasants
just
as
he
owned
its
immovable
boulders
and
ledges
to
this
the
peasants
submitted
but
history
has
not
been
able
to
drown
their
sighs
over
this
wrong
their
proverbs
and
ballads
make
george
day
representative
of
all
and
disappointment
a
few
years
later
boris
made
another
bid
for
oligarchic
favor
he
issued
a
rigorous
law
and
even
wrenched
liberty
from
certain
free
peasants
who
had
entered
service
for
wages
before
his
edicts
this
completed
the
work
and
russia
which
never
had
had
the
benefits
of
feudalism
had
now
fastened
upon
her
feudalism
worst
curse
a
serf
caste
bound
to
the
glebe
the
great
good
things
done
by
peter
the
world
knows
by
heart
the
world
knows
well
how
he
tore
his
way
out
of
the
fetichism
of
his
time
how
despite
ignorance
and
unreason
he
dragged
his
nation
after
him
how
he
dowered
the
nation
with
things
and
thoughts
that
transformed
it
from
a
petty
asiatic
horde
to
a
great
european
power
we
were
present
a
few
years
since
when
one
of
those
lesser
triumphs
of
his
genius
was
first
unfolded
it
was
in
that
room
at
the
hermitage
adjoining
the
winter
palace
set
apart
for
the
relics
of
peter
our
companions
were
two
men
noted
as
leaders
in
american
industry
one
famed
as
an
inventor
the
other
famed
as
a
champion
of
inventors
rights
suddenly
from
the
inventor
pulling
over
some
old
machines
in
a
corner
came
loud
cries
of
surprise
the
cries
were
natural
indeed
in
that
heap
of
rubbish
he
had
found
a
lathe
for
turning
irregular
forms
and
a
engine
once
used
by
peter
himself
specimens
of
his
unfinished
work
were
still
in
them
they
had
lain
there
unheeded
a
hundred
fifty
years
their
principle
had
died
with
peter
and
his
workmen
and
not
many
years
since
they
were
reinvented
in
america
and
gave
their
inventors
fame
and
fortune
at
the
late
paris
universal
exposition
crowds
flocked
about
an
american
lathe
for
copying
statuary
and
that
lathe
was
in
principle
identical
with
this
old
forgotten
machine
of
peter
yet
though
peter
fought
so
well
and
thought
so
well
he
made
some
mistakes
which
hang
to
this
day
over
his
country
as
bitter
curses
for
in
all
his
plan
and
work
to
advance
the
mass
of
men
was
one
supreme
lack
lack
of
any
account
of
the
worth
and
right
of
the
individual
man
lesser
examples
of
this
are
seen
in
his
grim
jest
at
westminster
hall
what
use
of
so
many
lawyers
i
have
but
two
lawyers
in
russia
and
one
of
those
i
mean
to
hang
as
soon
as
i
return
or
when
at
berlin
having
been
shown
a
new
gibbet
he
ordered
one
of
his
servants
to
be
hanged
in
order
to
test
it
or
in
his
review
of
parade
fights
when
he
ordered
his
men
to
use
ball
and
to
take
the
buttons
off
their
bayonets
greater
examples
are
seen
in
his
battle
of
narva
when
he
threw
away
an
army
to
learn
his
opponent
game
in
his
building
of
petersburg
where
in
draining
marshes
he
sacrificed
a
hundred
thousand
men
the
first
year
but
the
greatest
proof
of
this
great
lack
was
shown
in
his
dealings
with
the
serf
system
serfage
was
already
recognized
in
time
as
an
evil
peter
himself
once
stormed
forth
in
protestations
and
invectives
against
what
he
stigmatized
as
selling
men
like
beasts
separating
parents
from
children
husbands
from
wives
which
takes
place
nowhere
else
in
the
world
and
which
causes
many
tears
to
flow
he
declared
that
a
law
should
be
made
against
it
yet
it
was
by
his
misguided
hand
that
serfage
was
compacted
into
its
final
black
mass
of
foulness
for
peter
saw
other
nations
spinning
and
weaving
and
he
determined
that
russia
should
at
once
spin
and
weave
he
saw
other
nations
forging
iron
and
he
determined
that
russia
should
at
once
forge
iron
he
never
stopped
to
consider
that
what
might
cost
little
in
other
lands
as
a
natural
growth
might
cost
far
too
much
in
russia
as
a
forced
growth
in
lack
then
of
quick
brain
and
sturdy
spine
and
strong
arm
of
paid
workmen
he
forced
into
his
manufactories
the
flaccid
muscle
of
serfs
these
thus
lifted
from
the
earth
lost
even
the
little
force
in
the
state
they
had
before
great
bodies
of
serfs
thus
became
slaves
worse
than
that
the
idea
of
a
serf
developed
toward
the
idea
of
a
slave
and
peter
misguided
dealt
one
blow
more
officials
were
set
at
taking
the
census
these
adopted
easy
classifications
free
peasants
serfs
and
slaves
were
often
huddled
into
the
lists
under
a
single
denomination
so
serfage
became
still
more
difficult
to
be
distinguished
from
slavery
as
this
base
of
hideous
wrong
was
thus
widened
and
deepened
the
nobles
built
higher
and
stronger
their
superstructure
of
arrogance
and
pretension
not
many
years
after
death
they
so
overawed
the
empress
anne
that
she
thrust
into
the
codes
of
the
empire
statutes
which
allowed
the
nobles
to
sell
serfs
apart
from
the
soil
so
did
serfage
bloom
fully
into
slavery
but
in
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
russia
gained
a
ruler
from
whom
the
world
came
to
expect
much
to
mount
the
throne
catharine
ii
had
murdered
her
husband
to
keep
the
throne
she
had
murdered
two
claimants
whose
title
was
better
than
her
own
she
then
became
with
her
agents
in
these
horrors
a
second
messalina
to
set
herself
right
in
the
eyes
of
europe
she
paid
eager
court
to
that
hierarchy
of
scepticism
which
in
that
age
made
or
marred
european
reputations
she
flattered
the
fierce
deists
by
owning
fealty
to
voltaire
she
flattered
the
mild
deists
by
calling
in
la
harpe
as
the
tutor
of
her
grandson
she
flattered
the
atheists
by
calling
in
diderot
as
a
tutor
for
herself
her
murders
and
orgies
were
soon
forgotten
in
the
new
hopes
for
russian
regeneration
her
dealings
with
russia
strengthened
these
hopes
the
official
style
required
that
all
persons
presenting
petitions
should
subscribe
themselves
your
majesty
humble
serf
this
formula
she
abolished
and
boasted
that
she
had
cast
out
the
word
serf
from
the
russian
language
poets
and
philosophers
echoed
this
boast
over
europe
and
the
serfs
waited
the
great
empress
spurred
hope
by
another
movement
she
proposed
to
an
academy
the
question
of
serf
emancipation
as
a
subject
for
their
prize
essay
the
essay
was
written
and
crowned
it
was
filled
with
beautiful
things
about
liberty
practical
things
about
moderation
flattering
things
about
the
great
catharine
and
the
serfs
waited
again
she
aroused
hope
it
was
given
out
that
her
most
intense
delight
came
from
the
sight
of
happy
serfs
and
prosperous
villages
accordingly
in
her
journey
to
the
crimea
potemkin
squandered
millions
on
millions
in
rearing
pasteboard
villages
in
dragging
forth
thousands
of
wretched
peasants
to
fill
them
in
costuming
them
to
look
thrifty
in
training
them
to
look
happy
catharine
was
rejoiced
europe
sang
paeans
the
serfs
waited
she
seemed
to
go
further
she
issued
a
decree
prohibiting
the
enslavement
of
serfs
but
unfortunately
the
palace
intrigues
and
the
correspondence
with
the
philosophers
and
the
destruction
of
polish
nationality
left
her
no
time
to
see
the
edict
carried
out
but
europe
applauded
and
the
serfs
waited
two
years
after
this
came
a
deed
which
put
an
end
to
all
this
uncertainty
an
edict
was
prepared
ordering
the
peasants
of
little
russia
to
remain
forever
on
the
estates
where
the
day
of
publication
should
find
them
this
was
vile
but
what
followed
was
diabolic
court
pets
were
let
into
the
secret
these
by
good
promises
enticed
hosts
of
peasants
to
their
estates
the
edict
was
now
sprung
in
an
hour
the
courtiers
were
made
rich
the
peasants
were
made
serfs
and
catharine
ii
was
made
infamous
forever
so
about
a
century
after
peter
a
wave
of
wrong
rolled
over
russia
that
not
only
drowned
honor
in
the
nobility
but
drowned
hope
in
the
people
as
russia
entered
the
nineteenth
century
the
hearts
of
earnest
men
must
have
sunk
within
them
for
paul
i
catharine
son
and
successor
was
infinitely
more
despotic
than
catharine
and
infinitely
less
restrained
by
public
opinion
he
had
been
born
with
savage
instincts
and
educated
into
ferocity
tyranny
was
written
on
his
features
in
his
childhood
if
he
remained
in
russia
his
mother
sneered
and
showed
hatred
of
him
if
he
journeyed
in
western
europe
crowds
gathered
about
his
coach
to
jeer
at
his
ugliness
most
of
those
who
have
seen
gillray
caricature
of
him
issued
in
the
height
of
english
spite
at
paul
homage
to
bonaparte
have
thought
it
hideously
overdrawn
but
those
who
have
seen
the
portrait
of
paul
in
the
of
petersburg
know
well
that
gillray
did
not
exaggerate
paul
ugliness
for
he
could
not
and
paul
face
was
but
a
mirror
of
his
character
tyranny
was
wrought
into
his
every
fibre
he
demanded
an
oriental
homage
as
his
carriage
whirled
by
it
was
held
the
duty
of
all
others
in
carriages
to
stop
descend
into
the
mud
and
bow
themselves
himself
threw
his
despotism
into
this
formula
know
sir
ambassador
that
in
russia
there
is
no
one
noble
or
powerful
except
the
man
to
whom
i
speak
and
while
i
speak
and
yet
within
that
hideous
mass
glowed
sparks
of
reverence
for
right
when
the
nobles
tried
to
get
paul
assent
to
more
open
arrangements
for
selling
serfs
apart
from
the
soil
he
utterly
refused
and
when
they
overtasked
their
human
chattels
paul
made
a
law
that
no
serf
should
be
required
to
give
more
than
three
days
in
the
week
to
the
tillage
of
his
master
domain
but
within
five
years
after
his
accession
paul
had
developed
into
such
a
ravenous
wild
beast
that
it
became
necessary
to
murder
him
this
duty
done
there
came
a
change
in
the
spirit
of
russian
sovereignty
as
from
march
to
may
but
sadly
for
humanity
there
came
at
the
same
time
a
change
in
the
spirit
of
european
politics
as
from
may
to
march
for
although
the
new
czar
alexander
i
was
mild
and
liberal
the
storm
of
french
ideas
and
armies
had
generally
destroyed
in
monarchs
minds
any
poor
germs
of
philanthropy
which
had
ever
found
lodgement
there
still
alexander
breasted
this
storm
found
time
to
plan
for
his
serfs
and
in
put
his
hand
to
the
work
of
helping
them
toward
freedom
his
first
edict
was
for
the
creation
of
the
class
of
free
laborers
by
this
masters
and
serfs
were
encouraged
to
enter
into
an
arrangement
which
was
to
put
the
serf
into
immediate
possession
of
himself
of
a
homestead
and
of
a
few
acres
giving
him
time
to
indemnify
his
master
by
a
series
of
payments
alexander
threw
his
heart
into
this
scheme
and
in
his
kindliness
he
supposed
that
the
pretended
willingness
of
the
nobles
meant
something
but
the
caste
without
openly
opposing
twisted
up
bad
consequences
with
good
braided
impossibilities
into
possibilities
the
whole
plan
became
a
tangle
and
was
thrown
aside
the
czar
now
sought
to
foster
other
good
efforts
especially
those
made
by
some
earnest
nobles
to
free
their
serfs
by
will
but
this
plan
also
the
caste
entangled
and
thwarted
at
last
the
storm
of
war
set
in
with
such
fury
that
all
internal
reforms
must
be
lost
sight
of
russia
had
to
make
ready
for
those
campaigns
in
which
napoleon
gained
every
battle
then
came
that
peaceful
meeting
on
the
raft
at
tilsit
worse
for
russia
than
any
warlike
meeting
for
thereby
napoleon
seduced
alexander
for
years
from
plans
of
bettering
his
empire
into
dreams
of
extending
it
coming
out
of
these
dreams
alexander
had
to
deal
with
such
realities
as
the
burning
of
moscow
the
battle
of
leipsic
and
the
occupation
of
france
yet
in
the
midst
of
those
fearful
times
when
the
grapple
of
the
emperors
was
at
the
fiercest
in
the
very
year
of
the
burning
of
moscow
alexander
rose
in
calm
statesmanship
and
admitted
bessarabia
into
the
empire
under
a
proviso
which
excluded
serfage
forever
hardly
was
the
great
european
tragedy
ended
when
alexander
again
turned
sorrowfully
toward
the
wronged
millions
of
his
empire
he
found
that
progress
in
civilization
had
but
made
the
condition
of
the
serfs
worse
the
newly
ennobled
were
worse
than
the
old
they
hugged
the
serf
system
more
lovingly
and
the
serfs
more
hatefully
the
sight
of
these
wrongs
roused
him
he
seized
a
cross
and
swore
that
the
serf
system
should
be
abolished
straightway
a
great
and
good
plan
was
prepared
its
main
features
were
a
period
of
transition
from
serfage
to
personal
liberty
extending
through
twelve
or
fourteen
years
the
arrival
of
the
serf
at
personal
freedom
with
ownership
of
his
cabin
and
the
bit
of
land
attached
to
it
the
gradual
reimbursement
of
masters
by
serfs
and
after
this
advance
to
personal
liberty
an
advance
by
easy
steps
to
a
sort
of
political
liberty
favorable
as
was
this
plan
to
the
they
attacked
it
in
various
ways
but
they
could
not
kill
it
utterly
esthonia
livonia
and
courland
became
free
having
failed
to
arrest
the
growth
of
freedom
the
caste
made
every
effort
to
blast
the
good
fruits
of
freedom
in
courland
they
were
thwarted
in
esthonia
and
livonia
they
succeeded
during
many
years
but
the
eternal
laws
were
too
strong
for
them
and
the
fruitage
of
liberty
had
grown
richer
and
better
after
these
good
efforts
alexander
stopped
discouraged
a
few
patriotic
nobles
stood
apart
from
their
caste
and
strengthened
his
hands
as
lafayette
and
lincourt
strengthened
louis
xvi
they
even
drew
up
a
plan
of
voluntary
emancipation
formed
an
association
for
the
purpose
and
gained
many
signatures
but
the
great
weight
of
that
besotted
caste
was
thrown
against
them
and
all
came
to
naught
alexander
was
at
last
walled
in
from
the
great
object
of
his
ambition
pretended
theologians
built
between
him
and
emancipation
walls
of
scriptural
interpretation
pretended
philosophers
built
walls
of
false
political
economy
pretended
statesmen
built
walls
of
sham
if
the
czar
could
but
have
mustered
courage
to
cut
the
knot
alas
for
russia
and
for
him
he
wasted
himself
in
efforts
to
untie
it
his
heart
sickened
at
it
he
welcomed
death
which
alone
could
remove
him
from
it
alexander
successor
nicholas
i
had
been
known
before
his
accession
as
a
mere
martinet
a
good
colonel
for
parade
days
wonderful
in
detecting
soiled
uniforms
terrible
in
administering
petty
punishments
it
seems
like
the
story
of
stupid
brutus
over
again
altered
circumstances
made
a
new
man
of
him
and
few
things
are
more
strange
than
the
change
wrought
in
his
whole
bearing
and
look
by
that
week
of
energy
in
climbing
his
brother
throne
the
great
article
in
creed
was
a
complete
downright
faith
in
despotism
and
in
himself
as
despotism
apostle
hence
he
hated
above
all
things
a
limited
monarchy
he
told
de
custine
that
a
pure
monarchy
or
pure
republic
he
could
understand
but
that
anything
between
these
he
could
not
understand
of
his
former
rule
of
poland
as
constitutional
monarch
he
spoke
with
loathing
of
this
hate
which
nicholas
felt
for
liberal
forms
of
government
there
yet
remain
monuments
in
the
great
museum
of
the
kremlin
that
museum
holds
an
immense
number
of
interesting
things
and
masses
of
jewels
and
plate
which
make
all
other
european
collections
mean
the
visitor
wanders
among
clumps
of
diamonds
and
sacks
of
pearls
and
a
nauseating
wealth
of
rubies
and
sapphires
and
emeralds
there
rise
rows
upon
rows
of
jewelled
cimeters
and
vases
and
salvers
of
gold
and
old
saddles
studded
with
diamonds
and
with
stirrups
of
gold
presents
of
frightened
asiatic
satraps
or
fawning
european
allies
there
too
are
the
crowns
of
muscovy
of
russia
of
kazan
of
astrakhan
of
siberia
of
the
crimea
and
pity
to
say
it
of
poland
and
next
this
is
an
index
of
despotic
hate
for
the
polish
sceptre
is
broken
and
flung
aside
near
this
stands
the
portrait
of
alexander
i
and
at
his
feet
are
grouped
captured
flags
of
hungary
and
poland
some
with
still
upon
them
but
below
all
far
beneath
the
feet
of
the
emperor
in
dust
and
ignominy
and
on
the
floor
is
flung
the
constitution
of
poland
parchment
for
parchment
ink
for
ink
good
promise
for
good
promise
which
alexander
gave
with
so
many
smiles
and
which
nicholas
took
away
with
so
much
bloodshed
and
not
far
from
this
monument
of
the
deathless
hate
nicholas
bore
that
liberty
he
had
stung
to
death
stands
a
monument
of
his
admiration
for
straightforward
tyranny
even
in
the
most
dreaded
enemy
his
house
ever
knew
standing
there
is
a
statue
in
the
purest
of
marble
the
only
statue
in
those
vast
halls
it
has
the
place
of
honor
it
looks
proudly
over
all
that
glory
and
keeps
ward
over
all
that
treasure
and
that
statue
in
full
majesty
of
imperial
robes
and
bees
and
diadem
and
face
is
of
the
first
napoleon
admiration
of
his
tyrannic
will
has
at
last
made
him
peaceful
sovereign
of
the
kremlin
this
spirit
of
absolutism
took
its
most
offensive
form
in
attitude
toward
europe
he
was
the
very
incarnation
of
reaction
against
revolution
and
he
became
the
demigod
of
that
horde
of
petty
despots
who
infest
central
europe
whenever
then
any
tyrant
lie
was
to
be
baptized
he
stood
its
godfather
whenever
any
god
truth
was
to
be
crucified
he
led
on
those
who
passed
by
reviling
and
wagging
their
heads
whenever
these
oppressors
revived
some
old
feudal
wrong
nicholas
backed
them
in
the
name
of
religion
whenever
their
nations
struggled
to
preserve
some
great
right
nicholas
crushed
them
in
the
name
of
law
and
order
with
these
pauper
princes
his
children
intermarried
and
he
fed
them
with
his
crumbs
and
clothed
them
with
scraps
of
his
purple
the
visitor
can
see
today
in
every
one
of
their
dwarf
palaces
some
of
his
malachite
vases
or
porcelain
bowls
or
porphyry
columns
but
the
people
of
western
europe
distrusted
him
as
much
as
their
rulers
worshipped
and
some
of
these
same
presents
to
their
rulers
have
become
of
no
mean
value
in
showing
that
popular
idea
of
russian
policy
foremost
among
these
stand
those
two
bronze
masses
of
statuary
in
front
of
the
royal
palace
at
berlin
representing
fiery
horses
restrained
by
strong
men
pompous
inscriptions
proclaim
these
presents
from
nicholas
but
the
people
knowing
the
man
and
his
measures
have
fastened
upon
one
of
these
curbed
steeds
the
name
of
progress
checked
and
on
the
other
retrogression
encouraged
a
few
days
before
nicholas
brought
him
to
his
deathbed
we
saw
him
ride
through
the
petersburg
streets
with
no
pomp
and
no
attendants
yet
in
as
great
pride
as
ever
despotism
gave
a
man
at
his
approach
nobles
uncovered
and
looked
docile
soldiers
faced
about
and
became
statues
peasants
bowed
to
the
ground
with
the
air
of
men
on
whose
vision
a
miracle
flashes
for
there
was
one
who
could
make
or
mar
all
fortunes
the
absolute
owner
of
street
and
houses
and
one
who
owned
the
patent
and
dispensed
the
right
to
tread
that
soil
to
breathe
that
air
to
be
glorified
in
that
sunlight
and
amid
those
snow
crystals
and
he
looked
it
all
though
at
that
moment
his
army
was
entrapped
by
military
stratagem
and
he
himself
was
entrapped
by
diplomatic
stratagem
that
face
and
form
were
proud
and
confident
as
ever
there
was
in
this
attitude
toward
europe
in
this
standing
forth
as
the
representative
man
of
absolutism
and
breasting
the
nineteenth
century
something
of
greatness
but
in
his
attitude
toward
russia
this
greatness
was
wretchedly
diminished
for
as
alexander
i
was
a
good
man
enticed
out
of
goodness
by
the
baits
of
napoleon
nicholas
was
a
great
man
scared
out
of
greatness
by
the
phantom
of
the
french
revolution
in
those
first
days
of
his
reign
when
he
enforced
loyalty
with
and
halter
nicholas
dared
much
and
stood
firm
but
his
character
soon
showed
another
side
fearless
as
he
was
before
bright
bayonets
he
was
an
utter
coward
before
bright
ideas
he
laughed
at
the
flash
of
cannon
but
he
trembled
at
the
flash
of
a
new
living
thought
whenever
then
he
attempted
a
great
thing
for
his
nation
he
was
sure
to
be
scared
back
from
its
completion
by
fear
of
revolution
and
so
today
he
who
looks
through
russia
for
nicholas
works
finds
a
number
of
great
things
he
had
done
but
each
is
single
insulated
not
preceded
logically
not
followed
effectively
take
as
an
example
of
this
his
his
own
pride
and
russian
interest
demanded
railways
he
scanned
the
world
with
that
keen
eye
of
his
saw
that
american
energy
was
the
best
supplement
to
russian
capital
his
will
darted
quickly
struck
afar
and
americans
came
to
build
his
road
from
petersburg
to
moscow
nothing
can
be
more
complete
it
is
an
road
and
so
perfect
that
the
traveller
finds
few
places
where
the
rails
do
not
meet
before
and
behind
him
in
the
horizon
the
track
is
double
the
rails
very
heavy
and
admirably
ballasted
and
are
splendid
in
build
perfect
in
arrangement
and
surrounded
by
neat
gardens
the
whole
work
is
worthy
of
the
pyramid
builders
the
traveller
is
whirled
by
culverts
abutments
and
walls
of
dressed
granite
through
cuttings
where
the
earth
on
either
side
is
carefully
paved
or
turfed
to
the
summit
ranges
of
greek
columns
are
reared
as
crossings
in
the
midst
of
broad
marshes
lions
heads
in
bronzed
iron
stare
out
upon
vast
wastes
where
never
rose
even
the
smoke
from
a
serf
kennel
all
this
seems
good
and
a
ride
of
four
hundred
miles
through
such
glories
rarely
fails
to
set
the
traveller
at
chanting
the
praises
of
the
emperor
who
conceived
them
but
when
the
traveller
notes
that
complete
isolation
of
the
work
from
all
conditions
necessary
to
its
success
his
praises
grow
fainter
he
sees
that
nicholas
held
back
from
continuing
the
road
to
odessa
though
half
the
money
spent
in
making
the
road
an
imperial
plaything
would
have
built
a
good
solid
extension
to
that
most
important
seaport
he
sees
that
nicholas
dared
not
untie
police
regulations
and
that
commerce
is
wretchedly
meagre
contrary
to
what
would
obtain
under
a
free
system
this
great
public
work
found
the
country
wretched
and
left
it
wretched
the
traveller
flies
by
no
ranges
of
trim
palings
and
tidy
cottages
he
sees
the
same
dingy
groups
of
huts
here
as
elsewhere
the
same
cultivation
looking
for
no
morrow
the
same
tokens
that
the
laborer
is
not
thought
worthy
of
his
hire
this
same
tendency
to
great
single
works
this
same
fear
of
great
connected
systems
this
same
timid
isolation
of
great
creations
from
principles
essential
to
their
growth
is
seen
too
in
nicholas
foremost
of
all
the
edifices
on
which
nicholas
lavished
the
wealth
of
the
empire
stands
the
isak
church
in
petersburg
it
is
one
of
the
largest
and
certainly
the
richest
cathedral
in
christendom
all
is
polished
pink
granite
and
marble
and
bronze
on
all
sides
are
double
rows
of
titanic
columns
each
a
single
block
of
polished
granite
with
bronze
capital
colossal
masses
of
bronze
statuary
are
grouped
over
each
front
high
above
the
roof
and
surrounding
the
great
drums
of
the
domes
are
lines
of
giant
columns
in
granite
bearing
giant
statues
in
bronze
and
crowning
all
rises
the
vast
central
dome
flanked
by
its
four
smaller
domes
all
heavily
plated
with
gold
the
church
within
is
one
gorgeous
mass
of
precious
marbles
and
mosaics
and
silver
and
gold
and
jewels
on
the
tabernacle
of
the
altar
in
gold
and
malachite
on
the
screen
of
the
altar
with
its
pilasters
of
lapis
lazuli
and
its
range
of
malachite
columns
fifty
feet
high
were
lavished
millions
on
millions
bulging
from
the
ceilings
are
massy
bosses
of
siberian
porphyry
and
jasper
to
decorate
the
walls
with
unfading
pictures
nicholas
founded
an
establishment
for
mosaic
work
where
sixty
pictures
were
commanded
each
demanding
after
all
artistic
labor
the
mechanical
labor
of
two
men
for
four
years
yet
this
vast
work
is
not
so
striking
a
monument
of
nicholas
luxury
as
of
his
timidity
for
this
cathedral
and
some
others
almost
as
grand
were
in
part
at
least
results
of
the
deep
wish
of
nicholas
to
wean
his
people
from
their
love
for
dark
confined
filthy
sanctuaries
like
those
of
moscow
but
here
again
is
a
timid
purpose
and
half
result
nicholas
dared
set
no
adequate
enginery
working
at
the
popular
religious
training
or
moral
training
there
had
been
such
an
organization
the
russian
bible
society
favored
by
alexander
i
but
nicholas
swept
it
away
at
one
stroke
of
the
pen
evidently
he
feared
lest
scriptural
denunciations
of
certain
sins
in
ancient
politics
might
be
popularly
interpreted
against
certain
sins
in
modern
politics
the
corruption
system
in
russia
is
old
organized
and
respectable
stories
told
of
russian
bribes
and
thefts
exceed
belief
only
until
one
has
been
on
the
ground
nicholas
began
well
he
made
an
imperial
progress
to
odessa
was
welcomed
in
the
morning
by
the
governor
in
full
pomp
and
robes
and
flow
of
smooth
words
and
at
noon
the
same
governor
was
working
in
the
streets
with
ball
and
chain
as
a
convict
but
against
such
a
chronic
moral
evil
no
government
is
so
weak
as
your
strong
government
nicholas
set
out
one
day
for
the
kronstadt
arsenals
to
look
into
the
accounts
there
but
before
he
reached
them
stores
storehouses
and
were
in
ashes
so
at
last
nicholas
folded
his
arms
and
wrestled
no
more
for
apart
from
the
trouble
there
came
ever
in
his
dealings
with
thieves
that
old
timid
thought
of
his
that
if
he
examined
too
closely
their
chief
tenure
they
might
examine
too
closely
his
despot
tenure
we
have
shown
this
vague
fear
in
nicholas
mind
thus
at
length
and
in
different
workings
because
thereby
alone
can
be
grasped
the
to
his
dealings
with
the
serf
system
toward
his
toiling
millions
nicholas
always
showed
sympathy
let
news
of
a
single
wrong
to
a
serf
get
through
the
hedges
about
the
russian
majesty
and
woe
to
the
guilty
master
many
of
these
wrongs
came
to
nicholas
notice
and
he
came
to
hate
the
system
and
tried
to
undermine
it
opposition
met
him
of
course
not
so
much
the
ponderous
laziness
of
peter
time
as
an
opposition
polite
and
elastic
which
never
ranted
and
never
stood
up
for
then
nicholas
would
have
throttled
it
and
stamped
upon
it
but
it
did
its
best
to
entangle
his
reason
and
thwart
his
action
he
was
told
that
the
serfs
were
with
religion
were
contented
and
had
no
wish
to
leave
their
owners
now
nicholas
was
not
strong
at
spinning
sham
reasons
nor
subtle
at
weaving
false
conscience
but
to
his
mind
the
very
fact
that
the
system
had
so
degraded
a
man
that
he
could
laugh
and
dance
and
sing
while
other
men
took
his
wages
his
wife
and
homestead
was
the
crowning
argument
against
the
system
then
the
political
economists
beset
him
proving
that
without
forced
labor
russia
must
sink
into
sloth
and
poverty
yet
all
this
could
not
shut
out
from
nicholas
sight
the
great
black
fact
in
the
case
he
saw
and
winced
as
he
saw
that
while
other
european
nations
even
under
despots
were
comparatively
active
and
energetic
his
own
people
were
sluggish
and
stagnant
that
although
great
thoughts
and
great
acts
were
towering
in
the
west
there
were
in
russia
after
all
his
galvanizing
no
great
authors
or
scholars
or
builders
or
inventors
but
only
two
main
products
of
russian
civilization
dissolute
lords
and
abject
serfs
nearly
twenty
years
went
by
in
this
timid
dropping
of
grains
of
salt
into
a
putrid
sea
but
at
last
in
nicholas
issued
his
ukase
creating
the
class
of
contracting
peasants
masters
and
serfs
were
empowered
to
enter
into
contracts
the
serf
receiving
freedom
the
master
receiving
payment
in
instalments
it
was
a
moderate
innovation
very
moderate
nothing
more
than
the
first
failure
of
the
first
alexander
yet
even
here
that
old
timidity
of
nicholas
nearly
spoiled
what
little
good
was
hidden
in
the
ukase
notice
after
notice
was
given
to
the
that
they
were
not
to
be
molested
that
no
emancipation
was
contemplated
and
that
the
ukase
contained
nothing
new
the
result
was
as
feeble
as
the
policy
a
few
serfs
were
emancipated
and
nicholas
halted
the
revolutions
of
increased
his
fear
of
innovation
and
finally
the
war
in
the
crimea
took
from
him
the
power
of
innovation
the
great
man
died
we
saw
his
cold
dead
face
in
the
midst
of
crowns
and
crosses
very
pale
then
very
powerless
then
one
might
stare
at
him
then
as
at
a
serf
corpse
for
he
who
had
scared
europe
during
thirty
years
lay
before
us
that
day
as
a
poor
lump
of
chilled
brain
and
withered
muscle
and
we
stood
by
when
amid
chanting
and
flare
of
torches
and
roll
of
cannon
his
sons
wrapped
him
in
his
shroud
of
gold
thread
and
lowered
him
into
the
tomb
of
his
fathers
but
there
was
shown
in
those
days
far
greater
tribute
than
the
prayers
of
bishops
or
the
reverence
of
ambassadors
massed
about
the
winter
palace
and
the
fortress
of
peter
and
paul
stood
thousands
on
thousands
who
in
had
put
on
their
best
had
toiled
wearily
to
the
capital
to
give
their
last
mute
thanks
to
one
who
for
years
had
stood
between
their
welfare
and
their
owners
greed
sad
that
he
had
not
done
more
yet
they
knew
that
he
had
wished
their
freedom
and
loathed
their
wrongs
for
that
came
up
the
tribute
of
millions
the
new
emperor
alexander
ii
had
never
been
hoped
for
as
one
who
could
light
the
nation
from
his
brain
the
only
hope
was
that
he
might
warm
the
nation
somewhat
from
his
heart
he
was
said
to
be
of
a
weak
silken
fibre
the
strength
of
the
family
was
said
to
be
concentrated
in
his
younger
brother
constantine
but
soon
came
a
day
when
the
young
czar
revealed
to
europe
not
merely
kindliness
but
strength
while
his
father
corpse
was
still
lying
within
his
palace
he
received
the
diplomatic
body
as
the
emperor
entered
the
he
seemed
feeble
indeed
for
such
a
crisis
that
fearful
legacy
of
war
seemed
to
weigh
upon
his
heart
marks
of
plenteous
tears
were
upon
his
face
nesselrode
though
old
and
bent
and
shrunk
in
stature
seemed
stronger
than
his
young
master
but
as
he
began
his
speech
it
was
seen
that
a
strong
man
had
mounted
the
throne
with
earnestness
he
declared
that
he
sorrowed
over
the
existing
war
but
that
if
the
holy
alliance
had
been
broken
it
was
not
through
the
fault
of
russia
with
bitterness
he
turned
toward
the
austrian
minister
esterhazy
and
hinted
at
russian
services
in
and
austrian
ingratitude
calmly
then
not
as
one
who
spoke
a
part
but
as
one
who
announced
a
determination
he
declared
i
am
anxious
for
peace
but
if
the
terms
at
the
approaching
congress
are
incompatible
with
the
honor
of
my
nation
i
will
put
myself
at
the
head
of
my
faithful
russia
and
die
sooner
than
yield
strong
as
alexander
showed
himself
by
these
words
he
showed
himself
stronger
by
acts
a
policy
properly
mingling
firmness
and
conciliation
brought
peace
to
europe
and
showed
him
equal
to
his
father
a
policy
mingling
love
of
liberty
with
love
of
order
brought
the
dawn
of
prosperity
to
russia
and
showed
him
the
superior
of
his
father
the
reforms
now
begun
were
not
stinted
as
of
old
but
free
and
hearty
in
rapid
succession
were
swept
away
restrictions
on
telegraphic
communication
on
printing
on
the
use
of
the
imperial
library
on
strangers
entering
the
country
on
russians
leaving
the
country
a
policy
in
public
works
was
adopted
which
made
nicholas
greatest
efforts
seem
petty
a
vast
network
of
railways
was
begun
a
policy
in
commercial
dealings
with
western
europe
was
adopted
in
which
alexander
though
not
apparently
so
imposing
as
nicholas
was
really
far
greater
he
dared
advance
toward
freedom
of
trade
but
soon
rose
again
that
great
problem
of
old
that
problem
ever
rising
to
meet
a
new
autocrat
and
at
each
appearance
more
dire
than
before
the
serf
question
the
serfs
in
private
hands
now
numbered
more
than
twenty
millions
above
them
stood
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
owners
the
princely
strength
of
the
largest
owners
was
best
represented
by
a
few
men
possessing
over
a
hundred
thousand
serfs
each
and
above
all
by
count
scheremetieff
who
boasted
three
hundred
thousand
the
luxury
of
the
large
owners
was
best
represented
by
about
four
thousand
men
possessing
more
than
a
thousand
serfs
each
the
pinching
propensities
of
the
small
owners
were
best
represented
by
fifty
thousand
men
possessing
fewer
than
twenty
serfs
each
the
serfs
might
be
divided
into
two
great
classes
the
first
comprised
those
working
under
the
old
or
system
giving
usually
three
days
in
the
week
to
the
tillage
of
the
owner
domain
the
second
comprised
those
working
under
the
new
or
system
receiving
a
payment
fixed
by
the
owner
and
assessed
by
the
community
to
which
the
serfs
belonged
the
character
of
the
serfs
had
been
moulded
by
the
serf
system
they
had
a
simple
shrewdness
which
under
a
better
system
had
made
them
enterprising
but
this
quality
soon
degenerated
into
cunning
and
cheatery
the
weapons
which
the
hopelessly
oppressed
always
use
they
had
a
reverence
for
things
sacred
which
under
a
better
system
might
have
given
the
nation
a
strengthening
religion
but
they
now
stood
among
the
most
religious
peoples
on
earth
and
among
the
least
moral
to
the
picture
of
our
lady
of
kazan
they
were
ever
ready
to
burn
wax
and
oil
to
truth
and
justice
they
constantly
omitted
the
tribute
of
mere
common
honesty
they
kept
the
church
fasts
like
saints
they
kept
the
church
feasts
like
satyrs
they
had
curiosity
which
under
a
better
system
would
have
made
them
inventive
but
their
plough
in
common
use
was
behind
the
plough
described
by
vergil
they
had
a
love
of
gain
which
under
a
better
system
would
have
made
them
hardworking
but
it
took
ten
serfs
to
do
languidly
and
poorly
what
two
free
men
in
america
would
do
quickly
and
well
they
were
naturally
a
kind
people
but
let
one
example
show
how
serfage
can
transmute
kindness
it
is
a
rule
well
known
in
russia
that
when
an
accident
occurs
interference
is
to
be
left
to
the
police
hence
you
would
see
a
man
lying
in
a
fit
and
the
bystanders
giving
no
aid
but
waiting
for
the
authorities
some
years
ago
as
all
the
world
remembers
a
theatre
took
fire
in
petersburg
and
crowds
of
people
were
burned
or
stifled
the
whole
story
is
not
so
well
known
the
theatre
was
but
a
great
temporary
wooden
shed
such
as
is
run
up
every
year
at
the
holidays
in
the
public
squares
when
the
fire
burst
forth
crowds
of
peasants
hurried
to
the
spot
but
though
they
heard
the
shrieks
of
the
dying
separated
from
them
only
by
a
thin
planking
only
one
man
in
that
multitude
dared
cut
through
and
rescue
some
of
the
sufferers
the
serfs
when
standing
for
great
ideas
would
die
rather
than
yield
napoleon
i
learned
this
at
eylau
napoleon
iii
learned
it
at
sebastopol
yet
in
daily
life
they
were
slavish
beyond
belief
on
a
certain
day
in
the
year
the
most
embarrassed
man
in
all
russia
was
doubtless
our
excellent
american
minister
the
serf
coachman
employed
at
wages
was
called
up
to
receive
his
discharge
for
drunkenness
coming
into
the
presence
of
a
american
democrat
who
never
had
dreamed
of
one
mortal
kneeling
to
another
ivan
throws
himself
on
his
knees
presses
his
forehead
to
the
minister
feet
fawns
like
a
tamed
beast
and
refuses
to
move
until
the
minister
relieves
himself
from
this
nightmare
of
servility
by
a
full
pardon
time
after
time
we
have
entered
the
serf
field
and
serf
hut
have
seen
the
simple
round
of
serf
toils
and
sports
have
heard
the
simple
chronicles
of
self
joys
and
sorrows
but
whether
his
livery
were
filthy
sheepskin
or
caftan
whether
he
lay
on
carpets
at
the
door
of
his
master
or
in
filth
on
the
floor
of
his
cabin
whether
he
gave
us
cold
stupid
stories
of
his
wrongs
or
flippant
details
of
his
joys
whether
he
blessed
his
master
or
cursed
him
we
have
wondered
at
the
power
which
a
serf
system
has
to
degrade
and
imbrute
the
image
of
god
but
astonishment
was
increased
a
at
study
of
the
reflex
influence
for
evil
upon
the
themselves
upon
the
whole
free
community
upon
the
very
soil
of
the
whole
country
on
all
those
broad
plains
of
russia
on
the
daily
life
of
that
aristocracy
on
the
whole
class
which
was
neither
of
serfs
nor
the
curse
of
god
was
written
in
letters
so
big
and
so
black
that
all
mankind
might
read
them
farms
were
untilled
enterprise
deadened
invention
crippled
education
neglected
life
was
of
little
value
labor
was
the
badge
of
servility
laziness
the
very
badge
and
passport
of
gentility
despite
the
most
specious
despite
all
efforts
to
galvanize
it
to
coax
life
into
it
to
sting
life
into
it
the
nation
remained
stagnant
not
one
traveller
who
does
not
know
that
the
evils
brought
on
that
land
by
the
despotism
of
the
autocrat
were
as
nothing
compared
to
that
dark
network
of
curses
spread
over
it
by
a
aristocracy
into
the
conflict
with
this
evil
alexander
ii
entered
manfully
having
been
two
years
upon
the
throne
having
made
a
plan
having
stirred
some
thought
through
certain
authorized
journals
he
inspired
the
nobility
in
three
of
the
northwestern
provinces
to
memorialize
him
in
regard
to
emancipation
straightway
an
answer
was
sent
conveying
the
outlines
of
the
plan
the
period
of
transition
from
serfage
to
freedom
was
set
at
twelve
years
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
serf
was
to
be
fully
free
and
possessor
of
his
cabin
with
an
adjoining
piece
of
land
the
provincial
nobles
were
convoked
to
fill
out
these
outlines
with
details
as
to
the
working
out
by
the
serfs
of
a
fair
indemnity
to
their
masters
the
whole
world
was
stirred
but
that
province
in
which
the
czar
hoped
most
eagerly
for
a
movement
to
meet
him
the
province
where
beat
the
old
muscovite
heart
moscow
was
stirred
least
of
all
every
earnest
throb
seemed
stifled
there
by
that
strong
aristocracy
yet
moscow
moved
at
last
some
nobles
who
had
not
yet
arrived
at
the
callous
period
some
professors
in
the
university
who
had
not
yet
arrived
at
the
heavy
period
breathed
life
into
the
mass
dragged
on
the
timid
fought
off
the
malignant
the
movement
had
soon
a
force
which
the
retrograde
party
at
moscow
dared
not
openly
resist
so
they
sent
answers
to
petersburg
apparently
favorable
but
wrapped
in
their
phrases
were
hints
of
difficulties
reservations
impossibilities
all
this
studied
suggestion
of
difficulties
profited
the
reactionists
nothing
they
were
immediately
informed
that
the
imperial
mind
was
made
up
that
the
business
of
the
muscovite
nobility
was
now
to
arrange
that
the
serf
be
freed
in
twelve
years
and
put
in
possession
of
homestead
and
enclosure
the
next
movement
of
the
retrograde
party
was
to
misunderstand
everything
the
plainest
things
were
found
to
need
a
world
of
debate
the
simplest
things
became
entangled
the
noble
assemblies
played
solemnly
a
ludicrous
game
of
straightway
came
a
notice
from
the
emperor
which
stripped
of
official
verbiage
said
that
they
must
understand
this
set
all
in
motion
again
imperial
notices
were
sent
to
province
after
province
explanatory
documents
were
issued
good
men
and
strong
were
set
to
talk
and
work
the
nobility
of
moscow
made
another
move
to
scare
back
the
advancing
forces
of
emancipation
they
elected
as
provincial
leaders
three
nobles
bearing
the
greatest
names
of
old
russia
and
haters
of
the
new
ideas
to
defeat
these
came
a
successor
of
gregory
and
bavon
one
who
accepted
the
thought
that
when
god
advances
great
ideas
the
church
must
marshal
them
philarete
metropolitan
of
moscow
upheld
emancipation
and
condemned
its
foes
his
earnest
eloquence
carried
all
the
work
progressed
unevenly
nobles
in
different
governments
differed
in
plan
and
aim
an
assembly
of
delegates
was
brought
together
at
petersburg
to
combine
and
perfect
a
resultant
plan
under
the
eye
of
the
emperor
the
grand
council
of
the
empire
too
was
set
at
the
work
it
was
a
most
unpromising
body
yet
the
emperor
will
stirred
it
the
opposition
now
made
the
most
brilliant
stroke
of
its
campaign
just
as
james
ii
of
england
prated
of
toleration
and
planned
the
enslavement
of
all
thought
so
now
the
bigoted
plotters
against
emancipation
began
to
prate
of
constitutional
liberty
but
alexander
held
right
on
it
was
even
hinted
that
visions
of
a
constitutional
monarchy
pleased
him
but
then
came
tests
of
alexander
strength
far
more
trying
masses
of
peasants
hearing
vague
news
of
emancipation
learning
doubtless
from
their
masters
own
spiteful
lips
that
the
emperor
was
endeavoring
to
tear
away
property
in
serfs
took
the
masters
at
their
word
and
determined
to
help
the
emperor
they
rose
in
insurrection
to
the
bigoted
this
was
a
godsend
they
paraded
it
in
all
lights
therewith
they
threw
life
into
all
the
old
commonplaces
on
the
french
revolution
timid
men
of
good
intentions
wavered
the
czar
would
surely
now
be
scared
back
not
so
alexander
now
hurled
his
greatest
weapon
and
stunned
reaction
in
a
moment
he
freed
all
the
serfs
on
the
imperial
estates
without
reserve
now
it
was
seen
that
he
was
in
earnest
the
opponents
were
disheartened
once
more
the
plan
moved
and
dragged
them
on
but
there
came
other
things
to
dishearten
the
emperor
and
not
least
of
these
was
the
attitude
of
those
who
moulded
popular
thought
in
england
be
it
said
here
to
the
credit
of
france
that
from
her
came
constant
encouragement
in
the
great
work
wolowski
mazade
and
other
men
sent
forth
from
leading
reviews
and
journals
words
of
sympathy
words
of
help
words
of
cheer
not
so
england
just
as
in
the
french
revolution
of
while
yet
that
revolution
was
noble
and
good
while
yet
lafayette
and
bailly
held
it
leaders
in
english
thought
who
had
quickened
the
opinions
which
had
caused
the
revolution
sent
malignant

so
in
this
battle
of
alexander
against
a
foul
wrong
they
seized
this
time
of
all
times
to
show
all
the
wrongs
and
absurdities
of
which
russia
ever
had

or
ever
might

of

announced
a
desire
for
and
then
in
the
modern
english
way
with
plentiful
pyrotechnics
of
antithesis
and
paradox
threw
a
gloomy
light
into
the
skilfully
pictured
depths
of
imperial
despotism
official
corruption
and
national
bankruptcy
they
revived
old
world
objections
which
to
one
acquainted
with
the
most
workings
of
serfage
were
ridiculous
it
was
said
that
if
the
serfs
lost
the
protection
of
their
owners
they
might
fall
a
prey
to
rapacious
officials
as
well
might
it
have
been
argued
that
a
mother
should
never
loose
her
son
from
her
it
was
said
that
serfism
excludes
pauperism
that
if
the
serf
owes
work
to
his
owner
in
the
prime
of
life
the
owner
owes
support
to
his
serf
in
the
decline
of
life
no
lie
could
be
more
absurd
to
one
who
had
seen
russian
life
we
were
first
greeted
on
entering
russia
by
a
beggar
who
knelt
in
the
mud
at
kovno
eighteen
beggars
besieged
the
coach
and
kovno
was
hardly
worse
than
scores
of
other
towns
within
a
day
ride
from
petersburg
a
woman
begged
piteously
for
means
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
and
finished
the
refutation
of
that
sonorous
english
theory
for
she
had
been
discharged
from
her
master
service
in
the
metropolis
as
too
feeble
and
had
been
sent
back
to
his
domain
afar
in
the
country
on
foot
and
without
money
it
was
said
that
freed
peasants
would
not
work
but
despite
volleys
of
predictions
that
they
would
not
work
if
freed
despite
volleys
of
assertions
that
they
could
not
work
if
freed
the
peasants
when
set
free
and
not
crushed
by
regulations
have
sprung
to
their
work
with
an
earnestness
and
continued
it
with
a
vigor
at
which
the
philosophers
of
the
old
system
stand
aghast
the
freed
peasants
of
wologda
compare
favorably
with
any
in
europe
and
when
the
old
tirades
had
grown
stale
english
writers
drew
copiously
from
a
new
source
from
vérité
sur
la
pleasingly
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
the
author
praise
in
a
previous
work
had
notoriously
been
a
thing
of
bargain
and
sale
and
that
there
was
in
full
process
of
development
a
train
of
facts
which
led
the
parisian
courts
to
find
him
guilty
of
demanding
in
one
case
a
blackmail
of
fifty
thousand
rubles
all
this
argument
outside
the
empire
helped
the
foes
of
emancipation
inside
the
empire
but
the
emperor
met
the
whole
body
of
his
opponents
with
an
argument
overwhelming
on
march
he
issued
his
manifesto
making
the
serfs
free
he
had
struggled
long
to
make
some
satisfactory
previous
arrangement
his
motto
now
became
emancipation
first
arrangement
afterward
thus
was
the
result
of
the
great
struggle
decided
nikolai
turgenieff
in
the
emperor
alexander
ii
first
raised
the
question
of
emancipation
and
declared
it
was
time
for
it
to
be
accomplished
as
might
have
been
expected
the
idea
of
emancipation
met
with
great
opposition
from
different
sides
yet
the
opposition
was
directed
not
so
much
against
the
personal
emancipation
of
the
serfs
as
against
the
appropriation
to
them
when
liberated
of
the
land
they
held
the
proprietors
assembled
in
different
committees
which
were
established
all
over
the
empire
to
discuss
the
matter
ended
even
by
giving
up
their
right
of
possession
in
the
person
of
the
serf
and
mentioning
only
their
right
to
the
land
occupied
by
the
peasants
claimed
pecuniary
indemnities
if
that
land
were
delivered
to
them
the
honorable
gentlemen
whom
the
emperor
intrusted
with
this
important
task
forming
a
committee
declared
from
the
first
as
a
principle
that
the
emancipated
peasants
must
have
land
about
in
the
same
quantity
as
they
had
hitherto
occupied
on
condition
of
a
pecuniary
indemnity
to
be
paid
to
the
proprietors
that
principle
prevailed
thanks
to
the
emperor
firmness
during
the
discussion
of
that
question
in
russia
i
published
several
writings
on
the
matter
my
chief
purpose
and
warmest
desire
being
to
secure
to
the
peasants
as
soon
as
possible
their
personal
freedom
and
complete
liberty
of
labor
i
proposed
a
method
of
emancipation
claiming
the
entire
property
of
their
homes
that
is
to
say
cottages
and
orchards
and
a
small
quantity
of
arable
land
and
that
without
the
slightest
indemnity
from
them
to
their
masters
which
was
to
be
left
to
the
government
a
sum
of
about
two
hundred
million
dollars
according
to
my
calculation
would
have
been
sufficient
for
it
meanwhile
i
inherited
a
small
landed
property
inhabited
by
about
four
hundred
persons
of
both
sexes
i
hastened
to
put
in
practice
my
method
i
abandoned
of
the
land
including
their
houses
to
the
peasants
and
let
them
the
two
remaining
thirds
for
a
certain
sum
of
money
in
my
agreement
with
them
it
was
settled
that
if
the
emancipation
which
the
government
was
preparing
turned
out
more
advantageous
to
them
they
were
to
accept
it
in
preference
to
mine
it
is
needless
to
add
that
when
the
official
emancipation
was
proclaimed
the
peasants
and
i
found
it
more
advantageous
and
adopted
it
if
i
were
to
compare
the
two
methods
i
should
say
that
mine
tended
chiefly
to
the
liberty
of
the
peasants
person
and
labor
and
that
of
the
government
to
give
them
a
quantity
of
land
sufficient
for
their
subsistence
the
great
inconvenience
of
this
last
method
was
that
it
obliged
the
peasants
to
pay
a
heavy
rent
to
redeem
their
land
and
that
during
years
nevertheless
their
passion
to
possess
land
was
so
strong
that
they
cheerfully
submitted
to
such
hard
conditions
the
redeeming
rent
rente
de
was
to
be
paid
by
the
peasants
either
in
money
according
to
an
estimate
fixed
by
law
or
by
work
done
for
the
proprietor
by
this
last
mode
of
payment
sanctioned
by
law
only
for
a
short
period
disappeared
more
and
more
every
day
so
that
the
majority
of
the
peasants
no
longer
worked
for
the
proprietors
but
paid
their
rent
in
money
i
can
say
more
about
two
millions
of
peasants
were
entirely
liberated
with
regard
to
the
proprietors
thanks
to
an
immediate
payment
of
the
redeeming
rent
in
such
cases
their
annual
rent
was
capitalized
and
the
government
gave
the
proprietor
an
obligation
for
the
amount
of
the
capital
which
bore
five
per
cent
interest
and
was
to
be
redeemed
in
the
course
of
years
by
annual
drawings
the
peasants
then
to
pay
their
redeeming
rent
to
government
and
thus
become
free
and
independent
proprietors
for
some
time
both
peasants
and
proprietors
seemed
to
find
this
proceeding
the
most
profitable
and
agreements
of
this
kind
became
more
and
more
frequent
every
day
i
can
hardly
say
how
happy
i
was
when
i
saw
for
the
first
time
my
dear
beloved
and
deeply
respected
russian
peasants
free
at
last
and
proprietors
of
the
land
they
had
till
then
cultivated
as
serfs
what
a
change
the
same
creatures
serfs
yesterday
became
men
conscious
of
their
human
dignity
their
aspect
their
language
are
those
of
free
men
in
the
mean
while
in
getting
rid
of
their
serfdom
they
preserved
their
usual
good
sense
wisdom
and
no
impertinence
no
arrogance
whatever
can
be
detected
in
them
they
are
full
of
yet
polite
i
saw
them
discussing
with
the
authorities
some
business
of
theirs
they
maintained
their
new
rights
and
when
wrong
never
hesitated
to
acknowledge
it
every
district
and
every
had
every
year
an
assembly
of
deputies
who
named
a
permanent
committee
for
three
years
this
committee
was
charged
with
the
municipal
administration
under
the
control
of
the
assembly
everyone
was
called
by
law
to
the
election
of
the
deputies
it
happened
in
many
places
that
the
peasants
were
the
more
numerous
and
could
therefore
dispose
of
all
the
places
in
the
administrative
committee
they
were
so
informed
no
was
their
answer
we
want
one
or
two
members
of
the
committee
taken
from
among
ourselves
they
will
watch
over
our
interests
as
for
defending
them
as
for
action
the
nobles
we
name
will
do
it
better
than
we
for
they
are
more
learned
than
we
are
in
one
of
the
assemblies
the
nobles
moved
by
the
tact
and
moderation
of
the
peasants
insisted
and
almost
forced
a
peasant
to
become
president
of
the
administrative
committee
of
the
district
when
the
salary
of
the
members
of
the
committee
had
to
be
decided
the
peasants
usually
considered
it
too
high
for
them
and
letting
the
nobles
and
the
merchants
have
it
got
it
diminished
by
for
themselves
all
the
district
assemblies
after
voting
for
the
formation
of
the
administrative
committee
named
the
deputies
for
the
larger
assembly
in
the
chief
town
in
the
province
which
in
its
turn
chose
among
its
own
members
the
members
for
the
provincial
administrative
committee
the
central
committee
seemed
to
interest
the
peasants
less
than
those
of
the
districts
and
this
too
is
owing
to
their
modesty
and
moderation
another
field
was
offered
by
the
new
law
to
the
activity
of
the
peasants
in
the
local
or
municipal
tribunals
the
law
united
several
rural
communes
in
one
canton
volost
each
canton
each
commune
chose
an
assisted
by
a
in
every
canton
was
a
tribunal
to
judge
the
peasants
affairs
ancients
and
judges
were
elected
by
peasants
noblemen
were
not
submitted
to
these
tribunals
but
it
has
happened
that
some
of
them
preferred
having
their
difficulties
with
peasants
settled
by
municipal
judges
rather
than
by
the
usual
tribunals
this
jurisdiction
established
merely
for
peasants
had
great
importance
owing
chiefly
to
the
privilege
of
deciding
not
only
according
to
general
law
but
also
according
to
local
customs
opportunities
were
not
wanting
for
the
good
sense
of
the
peasants
to
show
itself
in
these
municipal
tribunals
and
councils
and
the
success
of
the
institution
