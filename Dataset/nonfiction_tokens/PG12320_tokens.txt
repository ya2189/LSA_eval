preface
learning
from
history
human
history
may
be
viewed
from
various
angles
the
easiest
history
to
write
concerns
the
doings
of
a
few
well
known
people
and
their
involvement
in
some
memorable
events
history
may
also
concern
itself
with
inventions
and
discoveries
the
use
of
fire
of
the
wheel
or
smelting
metals
it
may
center
around
sources
of
food
means
of
shelter
or
the
making
of
records
it
may
be
concerned
with
the
construction
and
decoration
of
cities
kingdoms
and
empires
social
history
enters
the
picture
with
travel
transportation
communication
trade
human
beings
group
themselves
in
families
clans
and
tribes
in
voluntary
associations
they
compete
plunder
conquer
enslave
exploit
they
for
construction
and
destruction
political
history
is
but
one
aspect
of
man
group
contacts
and
group
projects
there
have
been
histories
of
particular
civilizations
and
of
civilization
as
a
field
of
historical
research
with
minor
exceptions
none
of
the
authors
that
i
have
consulted
has
attempted
an
analytical
treatment
of
civilization
as
a
sociological
phenemenon
scientists
start
from
hunches
examine
available
data
advance
tentative
conclusions
test
them
in
the
light
of
wider
observations
and
round
out
their
research
by
formulating
general
principles
or
laws
this
scientific
approach
has
been
used
in
many
fields
of
observation
and
study
i
am
applying
the
formula
to
one
aspect
of
social
history
the
appearance
development
maturity
decline
and
disappearance
of
the
vast
of
collective
experimental
human
effort
called
civilizations
assyria
greece
rome
carthage
where
are
they
asked
byron
he
might
have
added
what
were
they
how
did
they
come
into
being
what
was
the
nature
of
their
experience
why
did
they
rise
from
small
beginnings
develop
into
colossal
complexes
of
wealth
and
power
and
then
after
longer
or
shorter
periods
of
existence
break
up
and
disappear
from
the
stage
of
social
history
such
questions
are
far
removed
from
the
lives
of
people
who
are
busy
with
everyday
affairs
in
one
sense
they
remote
in
the
larger
picture
however
they
are
of
vital
concern
to
anyone
and
everyone
now
living
in
civilized
communities
if
assyrians
egyptians
greeks
romans
and
carthaginians
built
extensive
empires
and
massive
civilizations
that
flourished
for
a
time
then
broke
up
and
disappeared
are
we
to
follow
blindly
and
unthinkingly
in
their
footsteps
or
do
we
study
their
experiences
benefit
from
their
successes
and
learn
from
their
mistakes
can
we
not
take
lessons
out
of
their
voluminous
notebooks
avoid
their
blunders
and
direct
our
own
feet
along
paths
that
fulfil
our
lives
at
the
same
time
that
they
meet
the
widespread
demand
for
survival
and
civilization
has
been
extensively
experimental
several
thousand
years
during
which
civilizations
have
appeared
disappeared
and
reappeared
have
been
too
brief
to
establish
and
stabilize
a
hard
and
fast
social
pattern
as
the
complexity
of
civilizations
has
increased
variations
and
deviations
have
grown
in
number
and
intensity
with
the
advent
of
western
civilization
a
culture
pattern
is
being
put
together
which
differs
widely
from
its
predecessors
all
civilized
peoples
seem
to
have
developed
from
simple
beginnings
and
experimented
with
broader
and
more
complicated
life
styles
in
western
civilization
the
number
of
experiments
has
increased
and
the
span
of
their
deviations
seems
to
have
broadened
under
the
circumstances
an
analysis
of
civilization
must
take
for
granted
not
only
social
change
but
the
development
of
human
society
along
lines
which
link
up
the
outstanding
structural
and
functional
ideas
institutions
and
practices
of
successive
civilizations
i
propose
in
this
inquiry
to
state
certain
accepted
facts
from
the
history
of
civilizations
and
of
contemporary
experience
i
also
propose
to
analyze
the
facts
and
generalize
them
in
such
a
way
that
the
results
of
the
study
may
provide
an
understanding
of
the
human
social
past
together
with
some
that
will
prove
useful
in
the
formulation
and
implementation
of
the
policy
and
procedure
of
civilized
peoples
nations
empires
and
of
the
western
civilization
this
book
is
not
a
popular
treatise
nor
is
it
a
textbook
rather
it
is
an
attempt
to
summarize
an
area
of
critical
human
concern
academia
may
not
use
such
material
nevertheless
it
should
be
available
to
students
and
administrators
who
must
plan
and
direct
the
social
future
of
humankind
and
rounds
out
a
series
of
studies
that
i
began
in
with
is
civilization
the
series
has
extended
through
twilight
of
and
tragedy
of
up
to
my
field
of
study
was
confined
largely
to
the
economics
of
distribution
the
war
of
pushed
me
rudely
and
decisively
into
the
broader
field
i
have
described
the
process
in
my
political
autobiography
of
a
i
hope
that
this
study
will
provide
a
useful
link
in
the
chain
of
material
dealing
with
the
structure
and
function
of
man
social
environment
leading
directly
into
an
action
program
that
will
conclude
the
preservation
and
loving
economical
use
of
nature
rich
gifts
and
the
dedication
of
thousands
of
young
aspiring
men
and
women
to
the
good
life
here
now
and
indefinitely
into
a
bright
productive
and
creative
future
as
of
this
date
seven
publishers
have
examined
the
manuscript
of
this
work
and
declined
to
publish
it
all
felt
that
it
would
not
find
any
considerable
reading
public
nevertheless
i
feel
that
the
work
should
be
printed
and
distributed
because
it
carries
a
message
that
may
be
of
first
rate
importance
to
the
future
of
my
fellow
humans
scott
nearing
harborside
maine
may
introduction
thoughts
about
history
and
civilization
we
may
think
and
talk
about
civilization
as
one
pattern
or
level
of
culture
one
stage
through
which
human
life
flows
and
ebbs
in
that
sense
we
may
regard
it
abstractly
and
historically
as
we
regard
the
most
recent
ice
age
or
the
long
and
painful
record
of
chattel
slavery
from
quite
another
viewpoint
we
may
think
of
civilization
as
a
technologically
advanced
way
of
life
developed
by
various
peoples
through
ages
of
unrecorded
experiment
and
experience
and
followed
by
millions
during
the
period
of
written
history
it
is
also
the
way
of
life
that
the
west
has
been
trying
to
impose
upon
the
entire
human
family
since
european
empires
launched
their
crusade
to
westernize
modernize
and
civilize
the
planet
earth
a
third
approach
would
regard
civilization
as
an
evolving
life
style
conceived
before
the
earliest
days
of
recorded
human
history
and
matured
through
the
series
of
experiments
marking
the
development
of
civilization
as
we
have
known
it
during
the
five
centuries
from
to
thinking
in
terms
of
this
experience
with
six
or
more
thousand
years
of
social
history
as
a
background
it
is
possible
to
give
a
fairly
exact
meaning
to
the
word
civilization
as
it
has
been
lived
and
is
being
lived
by
the
west
it
is
also
possible
to
understand
the
history
of
previous
civilizations
in
cycle
after
cycle
of
their
rise
their
development
decline
and
extinction
at
the
same
time
it
will
enable
the
reader
to
recognize
the
relationship
and
difference
between
the
words
culture
and
civilization
human
culture
is
the
sum
total
of
ideas
relationships
artifacts
institutions
purposes
and
ideals
currently
functioning
in
any
community
three
elements
are
present
in
each
human
society
man
nature
and
the
social
structure
human
culture
at
any
point
in
its
history
is
the
social
structure
the
aggregate
of
existing
culture
traits
the
products
of
man
ingenuity
inventiveness
and
experimentation
set
in
their
natural
environment
civilization
is
a
level
of
culture
built
upon
foundations
laid
down
through
long
periods
of
living
these
foundations
consist
of
artifacts
implements
customs
habit
patterns
and
institutions
produced
and
developed
in
numerous
scattered
localities
by
groups
of
migrating
herdsmen
cultivators
hand
craftsmen
and
traders
and
eventually
in
urban
communities
built
around
centers
of
wealth
and
power
the
cities
which
are
the
nuclei
of
every
civilization
urban
centers
housing
trade
commerce
fabrication
and
finance
with
their
hinterlands
of
herdsmen
cultivators
craftsmen
and
transporters
are
the
nuclei
around
which
and
upon
which
recurring
civilizations
are
built
within
and
around
these
urban
centers
there
grows
up
a
complex
of
associations
activities
institutions
and
ideas
designed
to
promote
develop
and
defend
the
particular
life
pattern
a
civilization
is
a
cluster
of
peoples
nations
and
empires
so
related
in
time
and
space
that
they
share
certain
ideas
practices
institutions
and
means
of
procedure
and
survival
among
these
features
of
a
civilized
community
we
may
list
means
of
communication
transportation
and
trade
this
would
include
a
spoken
language
a
method
of
enumeration
writing
in
pictographs
or
symbols
an
alphabet
a
written
language
inscribed
on
stone
bone
wood
parchment
paper
means
of
preserving
the
records
of
successive
generations
paths
roads
bridges
a
system
for
educating
successive
generations
meeting
places
and
trading
points
means
for
barter
or
exchange
an
interdependent
economy
based
on
division
of
labor
and
specialization
on
private
property
in
the
essential
means
of
production
and
in
consumer
goods
and
services
on
a
competitive
survival
struggle
for
wealth
prestige
and
power
between
individuals
and
social
groups
and
on
the
exploitation
of
man
society
and
nature
for
the
material
benefit
of
the
privileged
few
who
occupy
the
summit
of
the
social
pyramid
a
unified
centralized
political
apparatus
or
bureaucracy
that
attempts
to
plan
direct
and
administer
the
political
economic
ideological
and
sociological
structure
a
and
oligarchy
that
owns
the
wealth
holds
the
power
and
pulls
the
strings
an
adequate
labor
force
for
farming
transport
industry
mining
large
elements
professionals
technicians
craftsmen
tradesmen
lesser
bureaucrats
and
a
fringe
of
a
highly
professional
apparatus
for
defense
and

a
complex
of
institutions
and
social
practices
which
will
indoctrinate
persuade
and
when
necessary
limit

and
maintain

conformity
agreed
religious
practices
and
other
cultural
features
this
description
of
civilization
covers
the
essential
features
of
western
civilization
and
the
sequence
of
predecessor
civilizations
for
which
adequate
records
exist
successive
civilizations
have
introduced
new
culture
traits
and
abandoned
old
ones
as
the
pageant
of
history
moved
from
one
stage
to
the
next
or
advanced
and
retreated
through
cycles
using
this
description
as
a
working
formula
it
is
possible
to
understand
the
development
followed
in
the
past
by
western
civilization
to
estimate
its
current
status
and
to
indicate
its
probable
outcome
cry
aloud
in
protest
against
such
a
description
of
civilization
until
quite
recently
the
word
civilization
has
been
used
in
academic
circles
to
symbolize
a
social
idea
or
ideal
professor
of
history
anson
morse
of
amherst
college
presents
such
a
view
in
his
and
the
world
boston
ginn
for
him
civilization
is
the
sum
of
things
in
which
the
heritage
of
the
child
of
the
twentieth
century
is
better
than
that
of
the
child
of
the
stone
age
as
a
process
it
is
the
perfection
of
man
and
mankind
as
an
end
it
is
the
realization
of
the
highest
ideal
which
men
are
capable
of
forming
the
goal
of
civilization
is
human
society
so
organized
in
all
of
its
constituent
groups
that
each
shall
yield
the
best
possible
service
to
each
one
and
thereby
to
mankind
as
a
whole
producing
the
perfect
organization
of
humanity
page
such
thoughts
may
be
noble
and
inspired
they
are
not
related
to
history
we
know
more
or
less
about
a
score
of
civilizations
that
have
occupied
portions
of
the
earth
during
several
thousand
years
we
know
a
great
deal
about
the
western
civilization
which
we
observe
and
in
which
we
participate
professor
morse
florid
words
apply
to
none
of
the
civilizations
known
to
history
certainly
they
are
poles
away
from
an
accurate
characterization
of
our
own
varient
of
this
social
pattern
we
are
writing
this
introduction
in
an
effort
to
make
our
word
pictures
of
mankind
and
its
doings
correspond
with
the
facts
of
social
history
with
the
nuclear
sword
of
damocles
hanging
over
our
heads
it
is
high
time
for
us
to
exchange
the
clouds
of
fancy
and
the
flowers
of
rhetoric
for
the
solid
ground
of
historical
reality
the
word
civilization
must
generalize
what
has
been
and
what
is
as
nearly
as
the
past
and
present
can
be
embodied
in
language
civilization
is
a
level
or
phase
of
culture
which
has
been
attained
and
lost
repeatedly
in
the
course
of
social
history
the
epochs
of
civilization
have
not
been
distributed
evenly
either
in
time
or
on
the
earth
surface
a
combination
of
circumstances
political
economic
ideological
sociological
resulted
in
the
egyptian
the
chinese
the
roman
civilizations
one
of
these
was
centered
in
north
africa
the
second
in
asia
the
third
in
eastern
europe
all
three
spilled
over
into
adjacent
continents
no
two
civilizations
are
exactly
alike
at
any
stage
of
their
development
each
civilization
is
at
least
a
partial
experiment
a
process
or
sequence
of
causal
relationships
altered
sequentially
in
the
course
of
its
life
cycle
these
thoughts
about
culture
and
civilization
should
be
supplemented
by
noting
the
relationship
between
civilizations
and
empires
an
empire
is
a
center
of
wealth
and
power
associated
with
its
economic
and
political
dependencies
a
civilization
is
a
cluster
or
a
succession
of
empires
former
empires
and
directed
by
one
of
their
number
which
has
established
its
leadership
in
the
course
of
survival
struggle
the
total
body
of
historical
evidence
bearing
on
human
experiments
with
civilization
is
extensive
and
impressive
it
covers
a
large
portion
of
the
earth
land
surface
includes
parts
of
asia
africa
and
europe
and
extends
sketchily
to
the
americas
in
time
it
covers
many
thousands
of
years
experiments
with
civilization
have
been
conducted
in
highly
selective
surroundings
possessing
the
volume
and
range
of
natural
resources
and
the
isolation
and
remoteness
necessary
to
build
and
maintain
a
high
level
of
culture
over
substantial
periods
of
time
in
these
special
areas
it
was
possible
to
provide
for
subsistence
produce
an
economic
surplus
large
enough
to
permit
experimentation
and
ensure
protection
against
human
and
other
predators

together
many
facts
bearing

on

of

episodes
with

little

majority
at

the
reader
will
find
a
list
selected
from
the
many
books
that
i
have
consulted
in
preparation
for
writing
this
study
most
of
these
authorities
are
concerned
with
the
facts
of
civilization
with
far
less
emphasis
on
their
political
economic
and
sociological
aspects
in
this
study
i
have
tried
to
unite
theory
with
practice
on
the
one
hand
i
have
reviewed
briefly
and
as

as

outstanding
experiments
with

to

and
to
browse
through
some
of

will
have
had
the
equivalent
of
a
university
extension
course
dealing
with
one
of
the
most
critical
issues
confronting
the
present
generation
of
humanity
the
pageant
of

chapter

experiments
in
egypt
and
eurasia
thousands
of
years
before
the
city
of
rome
was
ringed
with
its
six
miles
of
stone
wall
other
peoples
in
asia
eastern
europe
and
africa
were
building
civilizations
new
techniques
of
excavation
identification
and
preservation
subsidized
by
an
increasingly
affluent
human
society
and
developed
during
the
past
two
centuries
of
archeological
research
have
provided
the
needed
means
and
manpower
the
result
is
an
imposing
number
of
long
buried
building
sites
with
their
accompanying
artifacts
still
more
important
are
the
records
written
in
long
forgotten
languages
on
stone
clay
tablets
metal
wood
and
paper
these
remnants
and
records
left
by
extinguished
civilizations
do
not
tell
us
all
we
wish
to
know
but
they
do
provide
the
materials
which
enable
us
to
reconstruct
at
least
in
part
the
lives
of
our
civilized
predecessors
extensive
in
time
and
massive
in
the
volume
of
their
architecture
are
the
remains
of
egyptian
civilization
the
earliest
of
these
fragments
date
back
for
more
than
six
thousand
years
the
seat
of
egyptian
civilization
was
the
nile
valley
and
its
estuary
built
out
into
the
mediterranean
sea
from
the
debris
of
disintegrating
african
mountains
annual
floods
left
their
silt
deposits
to
deepen
the
soil
along
the
lower
reaches
of
the
river
river
water
impounded
for
the
purpose
provided
the
means
of
irrigating
an
all
but
rainless
desert
countryside
skillful
engineering
drained
the
swamps
adding
to
the
cultivable
area
of
a
narrow
valley
cut
by
the
river
through
jagged
barren
hills
deserts
on
both
sides
of
the
nile
protected
the
valley
against
aggressors
and
migrants
within
this
sanctuary
the
egyptians
built
a
civilization
that
lasted
with
a
minor
break
for
some
years
egyptian
temples
and
tombs
carry
records
chiseled
and
painted
on
hard
stone
which
throw
light
on
the
life
and
times
of
egyptians
including
emperors
provincial
governors
courtiers
generals
merchants
provincial
organizers
in
a
humid
temperate
climate
these
and
painted
records
would
have
been
eroded
overgrown
and
obliterated
long
ago
in
the
dry
desert
air
of
north
africa
they
have
preserved
their
identity
through
the
centuries
since
the
egyptians
had
a
few
draft
animals
and
little
if
any
machinery
energy
needed
to
build
massive
stone
temples
tombs
and
other
public
structures
must
have
been
supplied
by
the
forced
labor
of
egyptians
their
serfs
and
slaves
egypt
history
dawns
on
a
society
the
old
kingdom
based
on
the
productivity
of
the
narrow
lush
nile
valley
the
products
of
the
valley
were
sufficient
to
maintain
a
large
population
of
cultivators
some
slave
some
forced
labor
about
which
we
have
little
knowledge
a
bureaucracy
headed
by
a
supreme
ruler
whose
declared
divinity
was
one
of
the
chief
stabilizing
forces
of
the
society
between
its
agricultural
base
and
its
ruling
monarch
the
old
kingdom
had
a
substantial
middle
class
which
procured
the
wood
stone
metals
and
other
materials
needed
in
construction
a
corps
of
engineers
technicians
and
skilled
workers
and
a
substantial
mass
of
humanity
which
provided
the
energy
needed
to
erect
the
temples
monuments
and
other
remains
which
testify
to
the
political
economic
and
cultural
competence
of
the
ruling
elements
and
the
technical
skills
present
in
the
old
kingdom
foremost
among
the
factors
responsible
for
the
success
of
the
old
kingdom
was
the
close
partnership
between
the
lords
temporal
and
the
lords
spiritual
the
state
and
the
church
the
state
consisted
of
a
highly
centralized
monarchy
ruled
by
a
pharoah
who
personified
temporal
authority
this
authority
was
strengthened
because
it
represented
a
consensus
of
the
many
gods
recognized
and
worshiped
by
the
egyptians
of
the
old
kingdom
the
monarch
was
also
looked
upon
as
an
embodiment
of
divinity
some
egyptian
pharoahs
had
been
priests
who
became
rulers
others
had
been
rulers
who
became
priests
the
two
aspects
of
public
life
political
and
religious
were
closely
interrelated
in
theory
the
land
of
egypt
was
the
property
of
the
pharoah
foreign
trade
was
a
state
monopoly
in
practice
the
ownership
and
use
of
land
were
shared
with
the
temples
and
with
those
members
of
the
nobility
closest
to
the
ruling
monarch
hence
there
were
state
lands
and
state
income
and
temple
lands
and
temple
income
the
use
of
state
lands
was
alloted
to
favorites
each
temple
had
land
which
it
used
for
its
own
purposes
political
power
in
the
old
kingdom
was
a
tight
monopoly
held
by
the
ruling
dynasty
of
the
period
during
preceding
epochs
it
seems
likely
that
rival
groups
or
factions
had
gone
through
a
period
of
struggle
which
eliminated
one
rival
after
another
until
economic
ownership
and
political
authority
were
both
vested
in
the
same
ruling
oligarchs
this
struggle
for
consolidation
apparently
reached
its
climax
when
menes
a
pharoah
who
began
his
rule
about
in
the
south
of
egypt
invaded
and
conquered
the
delta
and
merged
the
two
kingdoms
south
and
north
into
one
nation
which
preserved
its
identity
and
its
sovereignty
until
the
persian
conquest
of
the
unification
of
the
northern
kingdom
with
the
south
seems
to
have
been
a
slow
process
interrupted
by
insurrections
and
rebellions
in
the
delta
and
in
lybia
inscriptions
report
the
suppression
of
these
insurrections
and
give
the
number
of
brought
to
the
south
as
slaves
in
one
instance
the
captives
numbered
in
addition
to
small
cattle
and
large
cattle
using
these
war
captives
to
supplement
the
home
supply
of
forced
and
free
labor
successive
dynasties
built
temples
palaces
and
tombs
constructed
new
cities
drained
and
irrigated
land
sent
expeditions
to
the
sinai
peninsula
to
mine
copper
such
enterprises
indicate
a
considerable
economic
surplus
above
that
required
to
take
care
of
a
growing
population
the
high
degree
of
organization
required
to
plan
and
assemble
such
enterprises
and
the
considerable
engineering
and
technological
capacity
necessary
for
their
execution
chief
among
the
binding
forces
holding
together
the
extensive
apparatus
known
as
the
old
kingdom
was
religion
with
its
gods
its
temples
and
their
generous
endowments
each
locality
consolidated
into
the
old
kingdom
had
its
gods
and
their
places
for
worship
in
addition
to
these
local
religious
centers
there
was
an
hierarchy
of
national
deities
their
temples
temple
lands
and
endowments
the
ruling
monarch
who
was
official
servitor
of
the
national
gods
interpreting
their
will
and
adding
to
the
endowments
of
the
temples
was
the
embodiment
of
secular
and
of
religious
authority
egyptians
of
the
period
believed
that
death
was
not
an
end
but
a
transition
they
also
believed
that
those
who
passed
through
the
death
process
would
have
many
of
the
needs
and
wants
associated
with
life
on
the
earth
furthermore
they
believed
that
in
the
course
of
their
future
existence
those
who
had
died
would
again
inhabit
the
bodies
that
they
had
during
their
previous
existences
on
earth
following
out
these
beliefs
the
egyptians
put
into
their
tombs
a
full
assortment
of
the
food
clothing
implements
and
instruments
which
they
had
used
during
their
earth
life
they
also
embalmed
the
bodies
of
their
dead
with
the
utmost
care
and
buried
them
in
carefully
hidden
tombs
where
they
would
be
found
by
their
former
users
and
occupied
for
the
day
of
judgment
holding
such
views
preparation
for
the
phase
of
life
subsequent
to
death
was
a
chief
object
of
the
early
egyptian
rulers
and
their
subjects
one
of
the
preoccupations
of
each
new
occupant
of
the
throne
was
the
selection
of
his
burial
place
early
in
his
reign
he
began
the
construction
of
suitable
quarters
for
the
reception
of
his
embalmed
body
the
great
pyramids
were
such
tombs
other
monarchs
constructed
chambers
for
the
reception
of
their
bodies
in
these
chambers
in
addition
to
a
room
for
a
sarcophagus
were
associated
rooms
in
which
every
imaginable
need
of
the
dead
was
stored
food
clothing
furniture
jewelry
weapons
adjacent
to
the
royal
tomb
favored
nobles
received
permission
to
build
their
own
tombs
similarly
equipped
but
on
a
smaller
less
grandiose
scale
than
that
of
the
pharaoh
by
this
means
the
courtiers
who
had
attended
the
pharaoh
in
his
would
be
at
hand
to
perform
similar
services
in
the
after
death
existence
construction
and
maintenance
of
temples
and
tombs
absorbed
a
considerable
part
of
egypt
economic
surplus
these
drains
on
the
economy
grew
more
extensive
as
the
country
became
more
populous
and
more
productive
thanks
to
the
lack
of
rain
in
and
near
the
nile
valley
and
despite
the
depleting
activities
of
persistent
vandalism
these
constructs
have
stood
for
thirty
centuries
as
monuments
to
one
of
the
most
extensive
and
elaborate
civilizations
known
to
historians
despite
the
absence
of
detailed
records
egyptian
achievements
under
the
old
kingdom
indicate
an
abundance
of
food
wood
metal
and
other
resources
far
in
excess
of
survival
requirements
a
population
sufficiently
extensive
to
produce
the
necessaries
of
existence
and
a
surplus
which
made
it
possible
for
the
lords
temporal
and
spiritual
to
erect
such
astonishing
and
enduring
monuments
high
levels
of
technical
skills
among
woodsmen
quarrymen
and
building
crews
the
transport
facilities
by
land
and
water
required
to
assemble
the
materials
equipment
and
man
power
the
foresight
planning
timing
and
management
involved
in
such
constructs
as
the
pyramids
temples
and
tombs
which
have
withstood
the
wear
and
tear
of
thousands
of
years
the
willingness
and
capacity
of
professionals
technicians
skilled
workers
and
the
masses
of
free
and
slave
labor
to
and
over
the
long
periods
required
for
the
completion
of
such
extensive
structural
projects
the
utilization
of
an
extensive
economic
surplus
not
primarily
for
personal
mass
or
consumption
but
to
enhance
the
power
and
glory
of
a
tiny
minority
its
handymen
and
other
dependents
and
a
considerable
middle
class
of
merchants
managers
and
technicians
speaking
sociologically
the
structure
of
egyptian
society
from
sometime
before
to
passed
through
four
distinct
phases
or
stages
during
the
first
phase
the
nile
valley
which
had
been
separated
by
tribal
geographical
boundaries
into
a
large
number
of
more
or
less
independent
units
was
consolidated
integrated
and
organized
into
a
single
kingdom
this
working
functioning
area
the
land
of
egypt
could
provide
for
most
of
its
basic
needs
from
within
its
own
borders
in
a
sense
it
was
a
workable
liveable
area
egypt
was
populous
rich
well
organized
with
a
surplus
of
wealth
productivity
and
that
could
be
used
outside
of
its
own
frontiers
some
of
the
surplus
was
used
outside
to
the
south
into
central
africa
to
the
west
into
north
africa
to
the
north
into
eastern
europe
and
western
asia
inaugurating
the
second
phase
of
egyptian
development
during
this
second
phase
egyptian
wealth
population
and
technology
spilling
over
its
frontiers
onto
foreign
lands
established
and
maintained
relations
with
foreign
territory
on
a
basis
that
yielded
a
yearly
tribute
paid
by
foreigners
into
the
egyptian
treasury
the
land
of
egypt
thus
surrounded
itself
with
a
cluster
of
dependencies
converting
what
had
been
an
independent
state
or
independent
states
into
a
functioning
empire
the
land
of
egypt
was
the
nucleus
of
the
egyptian
empire
center
of
wealth
and
power
with
its
associates
and
its
dependencies
the
empire
was
held
together
by
a
legal
authority
using
armed
force
where
necessary
to
assert
or
preserve
its
identity
and
unity
expansion
the
third
phase
of
egyptian
development
involved
the
export
of
culture
traits
and
artifacts
beyond
national
frontiers
extending
the
cultural
influence
of
egypt
into
lands
inhabited
by
neighbors
merchants
tourists
travelers
explorers
and
military
adventurers
carried
the
name
and
fame
of
egypt
into
other
centers
of
civilization
and
into
the
hinterland
of
barbarism
that
surrounded
the
civilizations
of
that
period
thus
the
land
of
egypt
expanded
into
the
egyptian
empire
and
the
culture
of
egypt
its
language
its
ideas
its
artifacts
its
institutions
expanded
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
egyptian
political
authority
and
established
egyptian
civilization
in
parts
of
africa
asia
and
europe
the
era
of
egyptian
civilization
was
divided
into
two
periods
by
an
invasion
of
the
hyksos
nomadic
leaders
who
moved
into
egypt
ruled
it
for
a
period
and
later
were
expelled
and
replaced
by
a
new
egyptian
dynasty
the
fourth
period
of
egypt
experiment
with
civilization
was
that
of
decline
from
a
position
of
political
supremacy
and
cultural
ascendancy
egyptian
influence
weakened
politically
economically
ideologically
and
culturally
until
the
year
of
the
persian
conquest
when
egypt
became
a
conquered
occupied
provincial
and
in
some
ways
a
colonial
territory
egyptian
civilization
can
be
summed
up
in
three
sentences
it
covered
the
greatest
time
span
of
any
civilization
known
to
history
its
monuments
are
the
most
massive
its
records
chiefly
in
stone
picture
massed
humans
directed
for
at
least
thirty
centuries
toward
providing
a
satisfying
and
rewarding
for
a
tiny
favored
minority
of
its
population
to
achieve
this
result
the
natural
resources
of
three
adjacent
continents
were
combined
and
concentrated
into
the
nile
valley
through
an
effective
imperial
apparatus
that
enabled
the
egyptians
to
exploit
the
resources
and
peoples
of
adjacent
africa
asia
and
europe
for
the
enrichment
and
empowerment
of
the
rulers
of
egypt
and
its
dependencies
the
disintegration
and
collapse
of
egyptian
civilization
occupied
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
time
devoted
to
its
upbuilding
and
supremacy
before
during
and
after
egyptians
played
their
long
and
distinguished
parts
in
the
recorded
history
of
civilization
the
continent
of
asia
was
producing
a
series
of
civilization
in
four
areas
first
at
the
crossroads
joining
africa
and
europe
to
asia
then
in
western
asia
asia
minor
in
central
asia
especially
in
india
and
indonesia
and
finally
in
china
and
the
far
east
experiments
with
civilization
during
the
past
six
thousand
years
have
centered
in
the
eurasian
land
mass
including
the
north
african
littoral
of
the
mediterranean
sea
within
this
area
of
potential
or
actual
civilization
until
very
recent
times
the
centers
of
civilization
have
been
widely
separated
geographically
and
temporally
occasionally
they
have
been
unified
and
integrated
by
some
unusual
like
that
of
the
egyptian
the
chinese
or
the
roman
civilizations
in
the
intervals
between
these
various
centers
of
civilization
have
maintained
a
large
degree
of
autonomy
and
isolation
only
in
the
past
five
centuries
have
communication
transportation
trade
and
tourism
created
the
basis
for
an
experiment
in
organizing
and
coordination
of
a
experiment
in
civilization
nature
offered
humankind
two
logical
areas
for
the
establishment
of
civilizations
one
was
the
of
migration
trade
and
travel
by
land
to
and
from
asia
africa
and
europe
the
other
was
the
mediterranean
with
its
possibility
of
relatively
safe
and
easy
trade
and
travel
between
the
three
continents
making
up
its
littoral
both
possibilities
were
brought
together
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
with
its
multitude
of
islands
its
broken
coastline
and
its
many
safe
harbors
the
phoenicians
developed
their
trading
activities
around
the
mediterranean
as
a
waterway
and
the
crossroads
as
a
logical
center
for
a
civilization
built
around
business
enterprise
aegean
civilization
occupied
the
eastern
mediterranean
for
approximately
two
thousand
years
its
nucleus
was
the
island
of
crete
its
influence
extended
far
beyond
its
island
base
into
southern
europe
western
asia
and
north
africa
experiments
with
civilization
on
and
near
the
indian
centered
around
the
indonesian
archipelago
and
the
rich
and
tropical
valleys
of
the
ganges
the
indus
the
gadari
the
and
the
mekong
although
they
were
contiguous
geographically
and
extended
over
a
time
span
of
approximately
two
thousand
years
they
were
aggregates
rather
than
monolithic
civilizations
retaining
their
localisms
and
avoiding
any
strong
central
authority
beginnings
of
civilization
have
been
made
outside
the
triangle
centering
around
the
mediterranean
sea
and
the
band
of
south
asia
extending
from
mesopotamia
through
india
and
indonesia
to
china
they
include
the
high
andes
mexico
and
central
america
and
parts
of
black
africa
in
no
one
of
these
cases
did
the
beginnings
reach
the
stability
and

roman
civilization
deserves
a
very
high
rating
first
it
was
located
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
area
the
of
so
many
civilizations
second
it
was
part
and
parcel
of
a
prolonged
period
of
attempts
by
egyptians
assyrians
hittites
babylonians
mycaenians
phoenicians
and
others
in
the
area
to
set
up
successful
empires
and
to
play
the
lead
role
in
building
a
civilization
that
would
be
more
or
less
permanent
third
the
romans
seemed
to
have
the
hardiness
adaptability
persistence
and
capacity
for
necessary
to
carry
such
a
long
term
project
to
a
successful
conclusion
among
the
widely
varied
human
groups
occupying
the
eastern
mediterranean
area
between
and
the
romans
seem
to
have
been
well
qualified
to
win
the
laurel
crown
western
civilization
is
an
incomplete
experiment
its
outcome
remains
uncertain
its
future
still
hangs
in
the
insecure
balance
between
construction
and
destruction
between
life
and
extinction
it
is
our
civilization
in
a
very
real
sense
it
was
developed
by
our
forebears
we
live
as
part
of
its
complex
of
ideas
practices
techniques
institutions
since
we
are
in
it
and
of
it
it
is
difficult
for
us
humans
to
judge
it
objectively
roman
civilization
on
the
contrary
is
a
completed
experiment
one
that
came
into
being
developed
over
several
centuries
attained
a
zenith
of
wealth
and
power
then
sank
gradually
from
sight
until
it
lived
only
as
a
part
of
history
a
study
of
roman
civilization
has
two
advantages
first
its
life
cycle
has
been
completed
second
it
is
close
enough
to
us
in
history
and
its
records
are
so
numerous
and
so
well
preserved
that
we
can
form
a
fairly
accurate
picture
of
its
structure
and
its
functions
it
was
written
up
extensively
by
the
romans
themselves
by
their
greek
and
other
contemporaries
and
by
a
host
of
scholars
and
students
since
the
of
roman
civilization
as
a
political
economic
and
cultural
force
in
world
affairs
rome
experiment
is
sometimes
called
civilization
because
greece
and
italy
were
close
geographical
neighbors
and
also
because
greek
culture
which
reached
its
zenith
by
and
was
closely
paralleled
by
the
rise
of
roman
culture
had
a
profound
effect
in
determining
the
total
character
of
roman
civilization
in
a
very
real
sense
civilization
was
the
parent
of
western
civilization
among
the
many
completed
civilizations
of
which
we
have
fairly
adequate
records
those
concerning
rome
are
most
complete
and
most
available
the
story
of
roman
civilization
begins
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
basin
in
an
era
when
greek
and
phoenician
cities
together
with
segments
and
fragments
of
the
civilizations
were
competing
for
raw
materials
trade
and
alliances
egyptians
had
been
supreme
in
the
area
for
centuries
the
sumerian
aegean
chinese
hittite
assyrian
and
indian
civilizations
had
enjoyed
periods
of
dominance
but
had
never
reached
the
level
of
supremacy
enjoyed
by
the
egyptians
when
rome
came
on
the
scene
as
a
power
circa
the
crucial
land
bridge
joining
africa
europe
and
asia
was
being
passed
from
hand
to
hand
with
no
power
strong
enough
to
succeed
egypt
as
the
dominant
force
in
the
region
historically
speaking
it
was
an
interregnum
a
period
of
transition
egypt
had
ceased
to
dominate
the
public
life
of
the
area
the
trading
cities
of
the
greeks
and
the
phoenicians
were
pushing
their
way
of
life
into
the
front
ranks
among
the
recognized
powers
the
kingdoms
of
were
still
warring
for
supremacy
in
a
field
which
none
of
the
local
kingdoms
was
able
to
dominate
and
hold
for
any
considerable
period
of
time
public
affairs
at
the
crossroads
were
being
periodically
disturbed
and
upset
by
the
intrusion
of
asian
marauders
and
nomads
who
came
in
successive
waves
defeated
and
drove
the
native
inhabitants
off
from
the
choicest
land
and
settled
down
in
their
places
only
to
be
pushed
out
in
their
turn
by
fresh
asian
migrants
the
triangle
was
a
meeting
place
and
a
battle
ground
phoenician
and
greek
cities
brought
to
this
scene
new
factors
and
new
forces
the
rudiments
of
science
trade
and
commerce
including
a
money
economy
accounting
and
cost
keeping
the
elements
of
economic
organization
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
by
governments
based
on
law
rather
than
on
the
whim
and
word
of
a
deified
potentate
and
the
construction
of
cities
and
city
states
built
on
these
foundations
rome
entered
the
picture
when
the
forces
of
political
absolutism
based
upon
an
agriculture
operated
by
serfs
and
slaves
had
fought
themselves
to
a
standstill
and
exhausted
their
historical
usefulness
the
times
called
for
new
forces
capable
of
adapting
themselves
to
a
new
culture
pattern
extending
over
a
greatly
enlarged
world
the
romans
with
their
greek
associates
were
in
a
position
to
fill
the
gap
romans
lived
originally
in
latium
a
small
land
area
in
southern
italy
on
the
tiber
river
far
enough
inland
to
be
protected
against
pirates
they
built
a
city
which
finally
covered
seven
adjacent
hills
and
developed
a
community
of
working
farmers
merchants
craftsmen
and
professionals
the
farms
were
small
averaging
perhaps
eight
to
fifteen
acres
an
area
large
enough
to
provide
a
family
with
a
stable
though
meagre
livelihood
the
farmers
were
hard
working
and
frugal
at
this
period
of
roman
history
and
mythology
latium
was
one
of
many
communities
occupying
italy
each
was
each
took
the
steps
necessary
for
survival
and
expansion
like
their
neighbors
the
inhabitants
of
latium
were
prepared
to
defend
themselves
against
piracy
brigandage
and
ambitious
aggressive
rivals
defense
took
the
form
of
an
embankment
and
a
moat
which
surrounded
the
early
settlements
and
provided
shelter
for
herdsman
and
farmers
in
case
of
emergencies
at
some
point
in
presumably
when
etruscan
princes
were
in
control
of
roman
affairs
the
protective
earth
embankment
which
surrounded
the
roman
settlements
was
strengthened
by
building
a
moat
feet
wide
and
feet
deep
behind
the
moat
was
a
stone
wall
feet
thick
and
feet
or
more
in
height
parts
of
this
defense
were
built
and
rebuilt
at
various
times
when
completed
they
were
about
six
miles
in
length
enclosing
an
area
sufficient
to
accommodate
the
chief
buildings
of
the
city
and
living
space
for
a
population
of
perhaps
people
the
defenses
were
designed
to
prevent
interference
or
intrusion
into
the
life
of
the
romans
behind
them
the
inhabitants
constructed
temples
a
forum
palaces
and
other
public
buildings
bringing
in
clean
mountain
water
by
an
aqueduct
that
eventually
reached
a
length
of
miles
constructing
an
extensive
system
of
drains
and
sewers
that
disposed
of
city
wastes
building
a
network
of
roads
that
eventually
gave
the
romans
access
first
to
all
parts
of
italy
and
later
to
the
entire
mediterranean
basin
they
also
replaced
the
wooden
bridges
over
the
tiber
and
other
rivers
by
stone
bridges
carried
on
stone
piers
and
arches
early
in
their
building
activities
the
romans
learned
to
make
a
cement
so
that
many
of
their
constructs
are
still
usable
two
thousand
years
after
the
romans
built
them
these
and
similar
building
operations
made
rome
one
of
the
show
places
of
the
world
they
also
provided
for
the
romans
a
level
of
stability
and
security
far
beyond
that
of
their
neighbors
in
that
part
of
the
unstable
italian
peninsula
at
the
time
rome
was
founded
presumably
about
the
italian
peninsula
was
occupied
by
a
large
number
of
principalities
kingdoms
and
tribal
nomads
newly
arrived
from
eastern
europe
and
asia
the
struggle
for
pasturage
and
fertile
soil
for
dwelling
sites
and
trading
opportunities
went
on
ceaselessly
romans
like
their
neighbors
and
competitors
were
reaching
out
to
provide
themselves
with
food
building
materials
trade
opportunities
strategic
advantages
they
expanded
peacefully
if
possible
using
diplomacy
up
to
a
certain
point
and
only
engaging
in
war
as
a
last
resort
but
since
the
entire
italian
peninsula
was
occupied
by
more
or
less
independent
groups
each
of
which
was
seeking
a
larger
and
safer
place
in
the
sun
the
outcome
was
ceaseless
diplomatic
maneuvering
using
war
as
an
instrument
of
policy
in
the
struggle
for
pelf
and
power
four
centuries
of
power
struggle
in
which
romans
played
an
increasingly
prominent
role
gave
the
roman
republic
and
its
allies
substantial
control
of
the
entire
italian
peninsula
beginning
as
one
among
many
small
independent
states
in
italy
the
inhabitants
of
latium
emerged
from
four
centuries
of
competitive
diplomatic
and
military
struggle
as
the
de
facto
masters
of
all
italy
power
struggles
are
carried
on
by
contestants
who
occupy
a
particular
land
area
with
its
resources
and
other
advantages
latium
was
small
in
extent
some
square
miles
and
had
very
limited
natural
advantages
operating
from
this
restricted
base
through
four
centuries
of
diplomacy
intrigue
and
war
the
romans
enlarged
their
base
of
operations
to
include
the
whole
of
italy
in
this
crucial
era
of
its
history
rome
expanded
its
base
to
a
point
from
which
it
could
use
the
natural
and
human
resources
of
all
italy
as
a
nucleus
upon
which
to
build
the
roman
empire
in
europe
west
asia
and
north
africa
at
the
beginning
of
this
period
the
mediterranean
basin
housed
a
number
of
african
asian
and
european
empires
each
exercised
authority
over
a
part
of
the
mediterranean
littoral
each
empire
was
built
around
its
central
city
or
cities
each
empire
had
its
distinctive
institutions
and
practices
during
these
centuries
all
of
the
empires
were
defeated
conquered
occupied
and
either
dismembered
or
otherwise
brought
under
roman
control
extension
of
roman
authority
first
over
the
italian
peninsula
and
subsequently
over
parts
of
europe
africa
and
asia
was
the
result
of
a
policy
of
expansion
that
was
aggressively
persistently
and
patiently
followed
by
roman
leaders
and
policy
makers
neighboring
territories
were
amalgamated
into
the
nucleus
of
the
roman
empire
more
remote
territories
were
associated
by
treaty
as
allies
of
rome
as
dependent
or
client
dependencies
of
rome
and
as
colonies
or
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
in
all
cases
they
were
integral
parts
of
an
expanding
political
economic
and
military
sphere
of
influence
with
rome
and
later
italy
as
the
center
and
nucleus
in
the
course
of
this
development
the
expanding
roman
empire
grew
to
be
the
wealthiest
and
most
powerful
political
sociological
and
cultural
unit
in
the
area
the
roman
imperial
cycle
spanned
some
thirteen
centuries
during
this
period
roman
life
was
transformed
from
its
small
local
seat
of
authority
in
central
italy
into
its
new
stature
as
the
outstanding
power
in
the
mediterranean
area
economically
it
extended
from
peasant
proprietorship
and
a
use
economy
to
a
economy
from
a
society
of
working
peasant
farmers
to
an
economy
resting
upon
war
captives
reduced
to
slavery
from
an
economy
based
on
production
for
trade
and
profit
to
an
economy
based
on
special
privilege
speculation
and
corruption
from
an
austerity
economy
based
on
primary
production
to
an
economy
based
on
affluence
exploitation
and
gluttony
these
revolutionary
transformations
in
the
roman
economy
were
accompanied
politically
by
hardening
of
the
division
of
roman
society
along
class
lines
with
the
resulting
contradictions
antagonisms
and
class
struggles
including
open
class
warfare
domestic
contradictions
confrontations
civil
strife
and
formal
civil
war
were
present
throughout
the
entire
history
of
rome
they
existed
in
embryo
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
original
settlements
on
the
seven
hills
over
which
the
city
of
rome
eventually
spread
as
rome
and
its
interests
became
more
complex
socially
and
more
extensive
geographically
the
number
and
variety
of
contradictions
confrontations
civil
and
military
conflicts
increased
correspondingly
in
terms
of
individual
human
lives
the
changes
which
took
place
in
roman
society
during
the
six
or
seven
centuries
that
elapsed
between
the
early
roman
settlements
and
the
reign
of
their
emperor
augustus
were
profound
and
many
communities
of
diverse
and
often
incompatible
backgrounds
and
interests
were
herded
together
into
the
city
of
rome
latium
the
italian
nucleus
and
the
subsequent
alliances
federations
conquests
consolidations
into
colonies
occupied
areas
provinces
and
spheres
of
influence
the
greater
the
number
and
diversity
of
these
interests
and
relationships
the
greater
the
probability
of
conflict
this
empire
building
process
was
not
gradual
and
directed
with
scrupulous
care
to
preserve
the
amenities
and
niceties
of
polite
social
intercourse
the
job
was
done
by
and
under
the
direction
of
military
leaders
who
are
traditionally
in
a
hurry
to
get
results
the
subordinates
who
carried
out
military
decisions
were
soldiers
mercenary
adventurers
and
conscripts
drawn
form
the
four
corners
of
the
empire
as
the
empire
grew
in
extent
and
as
its
troubles
multiplied
the
military
was
more
frequently
called
upon
to
take
over
and
iron
out
difficulties
domestically
in
the
city
of
rome
and
its
immediate
environs
there
were
several
sharp
lines
of
cleavage
between
roman
citizens
and
between
the
aristocracy
the
bourgeoisie
the
working
proletariat
and
the
idle
proletariat
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
between
freeman
citizens
and
the
slaves
who
grew
in
numbers
as
the
wars
of
conquest
and
consolidation
multiplied
war
captives
between
the
civilian
bureaucrats
and
the
members
of
the
military
hierarchy
in
the
brief
period
of
maximum
territorial
expansion
following
the
defeat
and
destruction
of
carthage
the
frontiers
of
the
roman
empire
were
pushed
out
ruthlessly
north
east
west
and
south
in
the
of
rapid
expansion
individual
rights
were
ignored
local
communities
and
entire
regions
were
overrun
depopulated
and
resettled
with
the
tough
disregard
of
individual
and
local
interests
that
must
characterize
any
quick
general
movement
economic
sociological
or
military
if
the
expansion
expulsion
and
rehabilitation
had
produced
greater
degrees
of
stability
and
security
for
individuals
and
social
groups
they
might
have
been
tolerated
and
assimilated
by
the
diverse
populations
caught
up
in
the
maelstrom
of
drastic
expansion
but
rapid
coercive
social
transformation
produces
neither
stability
nor
security
its
normal
consequence
is
chaos
conflict
and
further
change
in
the
course
of
these
internal
conflicts
the
roman
republic
was
gradually
phased
out
in
theory
it
persisted
until
the
establishment
of
the
military
dictatorship
of
julius
caesar
practically
while
many
of
its
forms
remained
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
passed
more
and
more
into
the
hands
of
political
leaders
who
were
able
to
command
the
backing
of
the
legions
when
the
first
war
against
carthage
was
launched
in
carthage
was
at
the
height
of
her
power
situated
on
the
north
african
coast
almost
directly
across
the
mediterranean
from
italy
the
carthaginians
were
in
effective
control
of
the
western
mediterranean
carthage
was
firmly
entrenched
in
spain
it
was
trading
extensively
with
the
british
isles
fleets
of
carthaginian
war
ships
patrolled
the
mediterranean
guarding
against
piracy
and
economic
or
political
interference
by
rivals
roman
political
and
business
leaders
inexperienced
in
international
political
dealings
and
the
promotion
of
international
trade
found
their
further
expansion
to
the
west
blocked
by
carthaginian
political
economic
and
military
installations
the
result
of
the
confrontation
was
a
series
of
three
wars
that
began
in
and
ended
in
during
these
years
an
established
power
carthage
struggled
to
preserve
its
position
against
aggressive
roman
efforts
to
take
control
of
the
west
mediterranean
basin
the
carthaginians
under
the
able
generalship
of
hannibal
mobilized
a
military
force
including
elephants
marched
from
spain
over
the
alpine
passes
into
italy
reaching
the
gates
of
rome
romans
countered
with
the
slogan
carthage
must
be
destroyed
when
the
third
punic
war
ended
in
with
the
defeat
of
the
carthaginian
military
forces
the
city
of
carthage
was
leveled
the
defeat
of
carthage
gave
the
romans
control
of
the
western
mediterranean
during
the
same
period
roman
interests
were
pushing
into
east
europe
and
western
asia
in
philip
of
macedon
had
made
an
alliance
with
hannibal
directed
against
rome
consequently
three
wars
between
rome
and
macedonia
followed
the
third
ending
in
with
the
defeat
of
the
macedonians
and
their
subordination
to
roman
authority
in
the
form
of
a
roman
governor
when
opposition
to
roman
influence
developed
in
greece
in
a
commission
of
ten
was
appointed
by
the
roman
senate
to
settle
affairs
in
the
greek
peninsula
the
city
of
corinth
was
burned
to
the
ground
and
its
lands
were
confiscated
thebes
and
chalcis
were
also
destroyed
the
walls
of
all
towns
which
had
shared
in
the
revolt
against
rome
were
pulled
down
all
confederations
between
greek
cities
were
dissolved
disarmament
isolation
and
roman
taxation
were
imposed
on
the
greek
cities

of

to

together
and
defend

against

it
was
along
these
roads
that
the

marched
as
they
pushed
back
potential

and
extended
the

it
was
these

that
made

and
sure
the
advance
of
the
asian
hordes
that
would
one
day
occupy
and

city
roads

enabled

the

provided
a
freeway
that
led
into
the
citadel
of
roman
power
under
the
caesars
the
roman
empire
achieved
its
greatest
geographical
extent
and
exercised
its
widest
cultural
influence
the
city
of
rome
was
the
capital
of
the
western
world
there
was
one
state
one
law
one
economy
one
official
language
one
military
authority
despite
its
apparent
massiveness
roman
civilization
was
not
a
monolith
rather
it
was
a
conglomerate
consisting
of
many
parts
held
together
by
connecting
social
tissues
which
rome
and
italy
alone
supplied
in
the
first
instance
there
was
a
division
into
provinces
colonies
and
newly
acquired
territories
the
provinces
under
their
roman
appointed
governors
enjoyed
a
large
measure
of
economic
and
cultural
within
the
roman
empire
beyond
the
roman
empire
lay
territories
and
peoples
associated
with
rome
by
treaties
bound
to
rome
by
trade
and
travel
in
some
cases
paying
tribute
to
rome
but
enjoying
sufficient
autonomy
as
peoples
nations
and
empires
maneuvering
for
position
and
advantage
frequently
allying
themselves
with
areas
and
occasionally
conspiring
to
roman
authority
and
even
to
challenge
roman
supremacy
this
political
diversity
along
the
defense
perimeter
of
the
roman
empire
existed
in
a
chaos
ranging
from
questioned
authority
to
open
defiance
and
military
challenges
to
rome
and
the
threat
of
romanization
along
this
defense
perimeter
were
stationed
the
legions
that
guarded
the
frontiers
across
it
moved
trade
travel
incursions
invasions
and
periodic
reprisals
as
a
result
of
which
the
more
turbulent
neighbors
were
brought
within
the
sphere
of
rome
influence
or
in
cases
of
extreme
dissidence
and
resistance
were
depopulated
colonized
and
added
to
the
roman
conglomerate
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
influence
of
roman
culture
extended
far
beyond
the
roman
defense
perimeter
reaching
peoples
nations
and
empires
to
which
rome
was
little
more
than
a
name
the
land
between
and
rome
not
only
existed
in
a
state
of
perpetual
uncertainty
but
provided
a
battle
field
for
the
smuggling
brigandage
the
periodic
border
clashes
the
migrations
incursions
invasions
and
punitive
expeditions
that
are
the
characteristic
features
of
every
political
boundary
roman
civilization
under
the
caesars
was
a
centralized
absolutism
with
a
large
measure
of
peripheral
deviation
and
autonomy
it
was
directed
by
a
central
oligarchy
and
patrolled
defended
and
extended
by
a
military
force
unified
in
theory
but
in
practice
grouped
around
the
outstanding
personalities
and
subjected
to
the
vagaries
and
upsets
always
associated
with
power
politics
in
the
hands
of
military
backed
political
despots
roman
civilization
like
all
social
organisms
came
into
being
moved
toward
maturity
reached
a
plateau
of
fulfillment
from
which
it
declined
broke
up
and
eventually
disappeared
into
the
interregnum
known
as
the
dark
ages
the
entire
episode
occupied
a
dozen
centuries
its
beginnings
were
unimpressively
local
at
the
height
of
its
wealth
power
and
cultural
influence
it
bestrode
the
triangle
its
decline
and
disappearance
were
no
less
spectacular
than
its
meteoric
rise
to
fame
and
fortune
i
would
like
to
summarize
the
roman
experiment
and
some
of
its
lessons
by
listing
and
commenting
briefly
on
the
forces
that
built
up
roman
civilization
and
those
forces
which
resulted
in
its
decline
and
dissolution
primary
forces
in
the
roman
experiment
establishing
the

of

as
a
stable
defensible

of
merchandising
and
commerce
transport
finance
population
wealth
and
power
with
a
hinterland
of
associates
and
dependencies
as
it
turns
out
the
city
of
rome
has
outlived
both
the
roman
empire
and
roman
civilization
steadfast
dedication
to
roman
interests
first
by
all
necessary
means
and
despite
costs
which
at
the
time
seemed
to
be
excessive
a
recognition
of
that
which
is
possible
especially
in
political
relationships
the
acceptance
with
good
grace
of
a
where
no
more
was
available
consistent
persistent
aggression
and
expansion
where
such
policies
were
beneficial
to
rome
with
little
or
no
regard
for
their
effects
on
roman
associates
allies
friends
or
enemies
studied
ruthlessness

where
necessary
exterminating

that
did
not

with
the
major

and

of

in
their
stride
paying
the
price
and
recovering
lost
momentum
again
advancing
along
avenues
which
led
to

and
aggrandizement
indomitable
persistence
in
the
pursuit
of
major
objectives
after
the
reigns
of
julius
caesar
and
augustus

power
in
a

person
and
his
chosen
brain
trust
using
that
power
to
further
aggrandize
the
roman
empire
and
roman
civilization
this
category
is
not
complete
it
aims
to
answer
the
basic
question
in
a
situation
where
a
thousand
contestants
entered
the
and
struggle
first
for
survival
and
then
for
supremacy
what
qualities
or
qualifications
enabled
romans
to
win
the
laurel
crown
of
victory
paralleling
the
forces
that
established
roman
supremacy
were
which
undermined
and
eventually
destroyed
the
roman
empire
and
roman
civilization
the
growth
of
city
life
at
the
expense
of
rural
existence
at
the
outset
of
its
life
cycle
rome
was
essentially
rural
at
the
end
of
the
cycle
roman
culture
was
turning
its
back
upon
ruralism
and
moving
into
a
culture
that
was
to
be
chiefly
urban
during
an
entire
millennium
in
that
millennium
rome
her
associates
and
dependencies
experimented
with
a
culture
that
was
essentially
urban
but
encircled
dependent
and
eventually
replaced
by
a
culture
that
was
essentially
rural
during
the
millennium
between
and
the
romans
and
their
associates
succeeded
in
bringing
large
parts
of
europe
asia
and
africa
under
their
control
but
the
control
was
so
rigid
and
temporary
that
tribalism
and
local
nationalisms
broke
loose
from
the
fetters
of
central
authority
and
coercive
integration
shattering
the
structure
of
roman
civilization
and
its
structural
core
the
roman
empire
instead
of
resulting
in
closer
cooperation
the
strategy
and
tactics
of
the
roman
builders
and
organizers
led
to
contradictions
bitter
feuds
civil
strife
independence
movements
which
combined
with
expansionist
diplomacy
and
periodic
wars
to
discourage
frustrate
and
eventually
to
eliminate
peace
order
and
planned
progress
the
spread
of
chattel
slavery
had
a
profound
effect
upon
the
texture
of
roman
life
at
the
outset
roman
family
farms
housed
the
bulk
of
the
population
during
the
cycle
of
roman
civilization
unnumbered
millions
of
captives
were
seized
in
the
course
of
military
operations
and
reduced
to
slavery
by
the
end
of
the
roman
cycle
the
of
agriculture
commerce
industry
mining
transport
and
the
domestic
life
of
the
was
carried
by
slaves
basically
therefore
the
roman
world
was
divided
first
into
romans
and
and
second
into
masters
and
slaves
with
a
third
category
which
consisted
of
an
immense
bureaucracy
including
the
military
a
professional
and
technological
group
and
a
heavy
burden
of
persistent
parasitism
growth
of
the
abyss
that
separated
wealth
and
the
wealthy
from
mass
poverty
in
the
cities
and
the
countryside
the
abyss
was
widened
and
deepened
by
the
presence
of
slavery
more
extensive
and
more
frequent
foreign
conquests
added
to
the
volume
of
slave
labor
in
a
market
already
glutted
and
reduced
the
price
of
slaves
against
this
cheap
slave
labor
free
labor
could
compete
only
by
reducing
its
standard
of
living
and
thus
deepening
the
abyss
of
poverty
at
the
other
end
of
the
social
arc
the
rich
were
able
to
surround
themselves
with
multitudes
of
slaves
who
provided
the
energy
needed
to
carry
on
the
complex
life
of
roman
civilization
as
the
roman
world
expanded
the
abyss
widened
deepened
and
became
all
but
impassable
it
was
from
such
lower
depths
that
spartacus
and
other
leaders
of
rebellious
slaves
drew
sufficient
manpower
to
challenge
and
for
a
time
even
defeat
the
full
military
power
of
rome
built
into
the
structure
of
roman
civilization
was
the
potential
of
civil
war
the
contradictions
of
mass
slavery
and
poverty
side
by
side
with
boundless
leisure
and
abundance
was
only
one
side
of
the
picture
each
of
the
more
distant
provinces
became
a
possible
base
from
which
ambitious
governors
or
generals
could
wage
wars
of
independent
conquest
at
the
expense
of
roman
authority
each
newly
subjugated
people
smarting
under
defeat
and
the
heavy
hand
which
rome
laid
on
its
dissidents
and
opponents
became
a
potential
center
for
disaffection
conspiracy
and
rebellion
against
roman
authority
conflicts
over
power
succession
in
the
provinces
and
more
significantly
in
the
mother
city
added
another
aspect
to
the
many
sided
pressures
as
there
was
no
legal
means
of
determining
the
succession
the
end
of
each
imperial
reign
offered
the
probability
of
military
intervention
deification
of
emperors
during
the
era
of
the
caesars
led
to
the
denigration
and
degradation
of
the
common
man
the
fact
that
the
common
men
of
rome
were
more
and
more
likely
to
be
poor
slaves
furthered
the
process
and
deepened
the
abyss
between
the
haves
and
among
the
forces
of
disintegration
operating
in
rome
none
was
more
potent
and
more
decisive
than
the
numerical
growth
of
the
military
and
the
increasing
probability
that
any
one
of
the
growing
contradictions
and
conflicts
would
lead
to
intervention
by
the
military
roman
emperors
were
dictators
and
their
retention
of
authority
was
increasingly
decided
by
the
legions
which
were
willing
and
able
to
fight
for
the
perpetuation
and
extension
of
their
authority
the
extensive
complicated
elaborate
structure
of
roman

involved
a
persistent

implacable

was

instead
of
living

let
the

by
their

the

by
the
acceptance

individual
authority
roman
society
constantly
faced
and
consistently
failed
to
solve
the
contradiction
between
centralism
and
local
interests
and
local
rights
this
contradiction
increased
with
increasing
size
diversity
and
complexity
psychological
forces
played
a
part
in
the
breakdown
and
of
roman
civilization
people
lost
faith
and
hope
they
became
disillusioned
and
cynical
they
forgot
the
common
good
and
devoted
themselves
to
the
gratification
of
body
hungers
they
turned
from
proud
service
of
fatherland
to
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
for
pleasure

romans
lost
freshness
and
vigor
creativeness
had
never
been
as
highly
regarded
among
the
romans
as
it
was
among
the
greeks
life
was
lived
closer
to
the
surface
it
was
confined
more
and
more
to
the

growth
in
the
volume
of
roman
life
sapped
its
vitality
so
that
there
was
less
surplus
for
experiment
and
innovation
as
more
and
more
of
the

was
devoted
to
meeting
overhead
costs
moralists
have
insisted
that
the
decline
and
dissolution
of
roman
civilization
resulted
from
the
abandonment
of
moral
standards
undoubtedly
this
was
true
the
upstanding
womanhood
and
manhood
of
early
rome
was
replaced
by
a
parasitically
inclined
population
but
these
features
of
roman
life
under
the
empire
and
during
the
period
of
roman
decline
were
the
outcome
of
political
economic
and
social
forces
that
have
characterized
one
civilization
after
another
instead
of
insisting
that
rome
declined
and
fell
because
it
was
immoral
it
would
be
far
more
accurate
to
insist
that
rome
declined
and
fell
because
the
objectives
which
it
sought
the
means
it
employed
and
the
civilized
institutions
which
it
developed
contained
within
themselves
oppositions
and
contradictions
which
led

rome
declined

the

two
thousand

a

egyptian
civilization
was
passing
into

civilizations
in

were
developing
roman
civilization
was
approaching
the
zenith
of
its
ascendancy
a
thousand
years

roman
civilization
like
that
of

was
a
memory
chinese
and

civilizations
were
holding
their

were
reaching
out
into
central

north

and
eastern
europe
in
east
central
europe
and
around
the

the
beginnings
of
western
civilization
had
made
their
appearance
and
were
expanding
their
control
along
the
eurasian
trade
routes
and
beginning
to
penetrate
western
and
northern

the

had
introduced

dark

of

for
centuries
were
coming
to
an

western

was
beginning
to
draw
the
breath
of
a
new
life
the
vast
structure
of
roman
civilization
had
split
west
from

the
eastern

retained
its
form
and
continued
its
culture
for
centuries
after
its
break
with

meanwhile
the
west
fragmented
into
smaller

smaller
units
increasingly
and
increasingly
isolated
cities
raised

their

the
countryside
broke
up
into
smaller

smaller
divisions
over
which
the
holy
roman
empire
exercised
little
more
than
a
shadowy
authority
each
landed
estate
had
its
stronghold
or

each

looked
after
its
own
interests
the
massive
roman
universal
state
stretching
for
centuries
across
parts
of
three

had
broken
up
into
a
multitude
of
tiny

some
of
the

were
reaching

was
colossal
rome
one

been
replaced
by
an
all

the

by
a
sparsely
inhabited
roadless
wilderness
largely
bereft
of

using

as
the
easiest
means
of

the

was
built
around

was
the
condition

in
the
closing

seventeenth

the
opening

while
three
developing

the

representative

enlightenment
broadened
the
social
basis
of

during
the

knowledge

were
a
monopoly
of
a
tiny
privileged
minority
composed
of
priests
scholars
and
a
segment
of
the
aristocracy
monasteries
great
houses
and

cities
sheltered
this

the

was
a
sea
of
ignorance

literacy
and
curiosity
led

the
formulation

the
product
of
these
forces
was
science
which

of
gestation
in
north
africa

dark
ages
of

directing

led
to
the
concentration
of
wealth
and
power
in
the
landed
aristocracy
and
the

but
traders
in
the

and

in

held
a

the

economy
supplemented

it

enabled
the

politically
these
changes
reduced
the

of

made
their
appearance
the
third
force
that
surfaced
in
europe
after
the
end
of

was
the
industrial
revolution
which
led
to
fundamental
changes
in

produced
their

an
explosive

of

representative

led

a
rapid
and
extensive
transformation
of

referred

as
the

as

worked
its

into
the
structure

between

of
the
nineteenth

the
resulting
social
transformation
had
its
geographical
homeland
in

it

politically
these
forces
found
expression
through
the
colonizing
empires

course
of

europeans
set
up
military
outposts
and

the

to

western
civilization
like
its
predecessors
was
accepting
and
following
one
central
principle
expand
grab
and
keep
the
application
of
this
principle
took
the
form
of
an
axiom
of
public
and
private
life
might
makes
right
let

take
who
has
the
power
let

keep
who
can
grab

in
a
period
of
rapid
economic
expansion
led
each
of
the
burgeoning
european
empires
to
the
zealous
defense
of
its
frontiers
as
the
first
principle
of
imperial
policy
the
second
principle
geographical
expansion
followed
as
a
matter
of

expansion
inside
europe
with
its
tight
frontier
defenses
meant
war
with
aggressive
rivals
expansion
abroad
especially
in

was
less
costly
and
might
prove
more
profitable
as
a
consequence
from
onward
british
french
dutch
russia
and
german
colonial

increased
european
armaments
multiplied
each
expanding

prepared
for
the
day
which
would
give
it
additional
square
miles
of
european
and
foreign
real
estate
with
its
resultant
chaotic
was
the
rule
of
thumb
accepted
and
followed
by
the
west
during
the
decline
of
roman
power
and
through
the
middle
ages
to
modern
times
the
might
makes
right
formula
was
in
violent
conflict
with
the
love
and
serve
your
neighbor
professions
of
christian
ethics
nevertheless
it
was
the
accepted
overall
principle
of
private
enterprise
economy
and
the
ruling
ethic
of
western
statecraft
the
principle
was
formulated
in
five
propositions
or
axioms
make
money
honestly
if
possible
but
make
money
every
businessman
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
laggards
we
defend
and
promote
our
national
interests
our
national
interests
come
first
our
country
right
or
wrong
these
five
propositions
were
the
outcome
of
a
millennium
of
experience
with
the
crusades
and
extending
to
the
present
century
they
are
the
outcome
of
preoccupation
with
material
incentives
that
can
be
stated
in
two
words
profit
and
power
such
propositions
applied
to
everyday
affairs
produced
an
economy
and
a
statecraft
which
favored
the
interests
of
a
part
before
those
of
the
entire
community
where
the
whole
is
favored
before
any
part
there
is
a
possibility
of
and
even
of
cooperation
placing
a
part
before
the
whole
involves
competition
all
the
way
from
the
marketplace
to
the
chancelleries
where
the
fate
of
nations
is
discussed
and
decided
the
above
five
propositions
or
axioms
result
from
preoccupation
with
material
incentives
profit
and
power
for
managers
disciplined
for
subordinates
affluence
comfort
and
recognition
for
the
favored
few

faced

with

undeniable
facts
economic
political
and
social
changes
had
been
made
during
the
previous
capitalism
was
no
longer
supreme
as
it
had
been
before
on
the
contrary
since
the
planet
has
been
divided
along
class
lines
capitalism
versus
socialism
is
one
of
the
most
obvious
facts
of
planetary
life
capitalism
is
losing
ground
especially
in
europe
socialism
is
gaining
ground
especially
in
eurasia
presupposes
recognition
of
these
five
propositions
and
a
willingness
to
abide
by
the
outcome
of
the
process
through
which
the
western
world
is
passing
during
several
centuries
ending
in
western
civilization
passed
through
an
era
of
consolidation
and
integration
that
brought
its
sovereign
segments
into
increasing
stable
relationships
the
most
advanced
of
these
relationships
took
political
shape
in
the
european
empires
which
controlled
the
planet
in
side
by
side
with
the
consolidation
of
the
planet
into
nations
and
empires
there
was
another
process
in
scope
which
made
the
facts
and
products
of
science
and
technology
and
their
duplication
the
common
property
of
mankind
creating
a
cultural
synthesis
far
more
universal
than
the
political
synthesis
in
nations
empires
the
league
of
nations
or
the
united
nations
any
social
synthesis
includes
positive
and
negative
aspects
which
function
side
by
side
one
builds
up
the
other
wears
down
for
centuries
the
building
forces
in
western
civilization
were
in
the
ascendant
since
the
turn
of
the
century
a
shift
of
forces
has
been
under
way
the
wearing
down
forces
presently
are
in
the
ascendant
had
it
been
less
competitive
and
more
cooperative
and
western
civilization
might
have
taken
another
step
in
advance
by
extending
cultural
unification
into
the
political
arena
the
league
of
nations
and
the
united
nations
were
efforts
in
this
direction
neither
succeeded
in
breaking
down
sovereignty
far
enough
to
permit
political
federation
having
failed
to
and
establish
a
authority
during
the
critical
years
following
western
civilization
accepted
the
antithesis
of
and
entered
a
period
of
fragmentation
during
the
century
and
a
half
from
to
the
present
day
as
facilities
for
were
multiplied
by
discovery
and
invention
europe
remained
stubbornly
fragmented
into
more
than
a
score
of
sovereign
states
minor
changes
were
made
in
boundary
lines
and
in
internal
relationships
of
property
and
privilege
but
the
european
maps
of
the
period
present
a
record
of
persistent
fragmentation
of
the
continent
into
strongly
frontiered
sovereign
segments
of
the
european
empires
after
two
general
wars
led
to
the
fragmentation
of
each
empire
into
sovereign
units
the
third
world
consisting
chiefly
of
european

fragments
has
not
consolidated
but
after
the

of

consisted
of
a

africa

torn
by

and
conflicts
and
harried
by
the
persistent
intervention
of
the
western
powers
rivalry
in
the
pacific
and
in

has
been
heightened
by
the
meteoric
rise
of
japan
as
a
world
power
the
dismemberment
of
the
japanese
empire
after
and
the
fierce
subsequent
economic
competition
between
japan
and
her
planetary
competitors
chiefly
the
united

united

efforts
to
coordinate
latin
america
as
a
source
of

a
market
for
manufactures
and
investment
capital
have
not
produced
a
united
latin
american
front
against
a
common
yankee
menace
but
a
sturdy
refusal
even
of
the
tiniest
latin
american
republic
to
surrender
or
limit
its
sovereignty
has
pushed
a
thorn
into
the
vulnerable
side
of
washington
monroe
doctrine
control
of
the
western
hemisphere
the
high
point
in
divisiveness
was
the
decision
of
the
united
states
spokesmen
to
inaugurate
the
american
century
by
establishing
control
over
the
pacific
ocean
making
itself
the
chief
power
in
asia
and
installing
authority
in
the
power
vacuum
left
by
the
expulsion
of
britain
france
holland
and
japan
from
the
territories
composing
their
former
empires
local
wars
begun
in
korea
and
extending
across
southeast
asia
have
strengthened
the
determination
of
the
local
peoples
to
defend
themselves
at
all
costs
against
imperialist
invaders
from
europe
and
north
america
the
united
states
has
been
rich
enough
since
to
build
and
maintain
a
navy
that
can
patrol
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
and
the
mediterranean
sea
and
maintain
large
military
forces
in
various
european
and
asian
waters
this
policy
has
been
justified
by
the
doctrine
of
determined
opposition
to
the
extension
of
and
the
consequent
perpetuation
of
the
cold
war
in
theory
the
socialist
world
is
unitary
in
practice
it
is
so
fragmented
by
national
boundary
lines
and
ideological
differences
that
its
members
have
not
been
able
during
recent
years
to
get
together
and
discuss
their
major
common
problems
united
states
wealth
and
military
equipment
have
been
sufficiently
to
support
the
program
of
an
american
century
during
which
one
nation
might
establish
a
universal
state
exercising
authority
along
the
lines
of
the
universal
state
established
by
the
romans
at
the
zenith
of
their
power
in
practice
the
program
has
not
worked
out
on
the
contrary
opposition
to
the
united
states
as
world
power
or
even
as
power
in
asia
has
grown
steadily
and
quickly
into
a
widespread
or
conceivably
a
universal
movement
might
develop
a
hot
war
similar
to
the
coalition
of
the
if
that
precedent
is
followed
however
the
defeat
of
the
united
states
would
be
followed
by
a
period
of
fragmentation
similar
to
or
even
more
intense
than
the
fragmentation
of
the
and
present
efforts
to
shore
up
the
insolvent
economy
and
the
resulting
opposition
of
america
leading
european
trading
partners
is
not
reassuring
if
western
civilization
has
passed
the
zenith
of
its
development
and
entered
a
period
of
decline
and
fragmentation
even
a
figure
of
napoleonic
capacities
would
be
sorely
pressed
to
breathe
new
life
into
its
disintegrating
social
structure
at
the
moment
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
no
such
genius
is
in
sight
western
civilization
is
in
some
ways
unique
in
the
main
however
the
development
of
its
life
cycle
has
been
typical
may
we
take
it
for
granted
that
western
civilization
has
turned
its
corner
or
may
we
assume
that
it
is
still
replete
with
the
possibilities
of
further
maneuver
development
and
expansion
perhaps
the
best
way
to
approach
the
problem
would
be
to
ask
three
questions
what
contribution
has
western
civilization
made
to
human
nature
to
human
society
and
to
mother
nature
and
what
further
contribution
can
it
make
in
the
foreseeable
future
individuals
born
or
reared
in
any
form
of
society
are
adjusted
shaped
and
conditioned
by
the
social
pattern
of
which
they
are
a
part
each
society
attempts
to
stamp
the
individuals
with
its
own
image
and
likeness
the
success
or
failure
of
this
effort
to
assure
individual
adjustment
to
the
social
norm
and
conformity
to
its
practices
varies
with
the
prosilitizing
enthusiasm
of
the
society
and
with
the
ration
of
adaptability
and
of
its
individual
members
western
civilization
has
produced
a
bourgeois
human
being
intensively
conscious
of
his
capacities
and
anxious
to
try
himself
out
in
the
of
the
market
place
and
on
the
battlefield
to
initiate
undertake
direct
administer
in
the
main
these
are
characteristics
of
the
human
male
though
the
female
often
possesses
them
in
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
western
civilization
has
opened
the
doors
wide
to
aspirants
eager
to
win
out
in
the

of
it
has
been
equally
kind
to
their
chief
executives
organizers
and
managers
who
rank
second
or
third
in
the
chain
of
command
these
individuals
come
from
widely
different
backgrounds
the
social
mobility
of
a
bourgeois
society
gives
them
opportunity
to
climb
high
on
the
ladder
of
preferment
many
of
those
who
fall
into
line
adapt
themselves
to
the
civilizing
process
accept
with
alacrity
the
chances
that
come
their
way
but
do
not
reach
the
top
of

ladder
they
have
the
health
energy
and
assertiveness
necessary
to
keep
climbing
they
accept
their
assignments
and
carry
them
out
with
modest
success
they
are
the
lesser
executives
who
work
themselves
out
by
the
time
they
are
fifty
and
find
some
sinecure
or
safe
position
near
the

of
the

have
been
quite
generally
listed
among
the
undesirable
endowments
of

western
civilization
in
the
early
years
of
the

produced
a
generation
of
insecure
unsettled
anxious

people
this
is
generally
true
of
young
middle
aged
and
old
of
rich
and
poor
rapid
social
transition
from
expansion
and
advance
to
contraction
and
retreat
is
a
traumatic
hectic
experience
for
any
human
being
western
civilization
in
the
early
years
of
its
decline
has
not
brought
out
the
more
generous
aspects
of
human
nature
in
the
best
of
times
a
materialistically
oriented
society
appeals
to
the
more
material
and
less
spiritual
aspects
of
human

a
period
of

decline
leads
away
from

conduct
toward
unashamed
opportunism
the
current
generation
born

in
a

has
been
sorely
tested

from

the

are
likely
to
emerge
stronger
and
more
determined
for
the
weak
and
vacillating
the
consequences
are
likely
to
prove
disastrous
the
individual
born
into

society
during
its
current
time
of
troubles
has
not
had
an
easy
row
to
hoe
what
has
western

done
to
human
society
as
such
western
civilization
has
urbanized
its
society
until
recently
in

and
until
very
recently
in

the

of

were
living
outside

at

increased
the

in

relatively
the

was

were

western
civilization
grew
in

around
its
cities
both
in
form
and
function
it
was
urban
rather
than
rural
western
civilization
specialized
its

mechanized
it
and

computerized
it
making

depend
less

on

and
more
on
the
position
of

more
as

at

points
in

western
civilization
has
lifted
itself
temporarily
above
the
material
forces
that
hemmed
in
the
life
of
primitive
man
the
renaissance
was
one
such
period
the

another
a

the
scientific
breakthrough
from

to
the

which
split

and
inaugurated

these
gains
were
offset
by
the
growing
chasm
between
wealth
and
poverty
the
plunder
and
pollution
of

and
social

the
terrifying

features
of

exposure
of
an
entire
generation
to
wholesale
destruction
and
mass
murder
as
a
way
of

divergent
effects
it

it

masses
of

the

gained
experience
and
improved
their
qualifications
by
taking
part
in
conventional
warfare
and
in
the
innumerable
guerrilla
adventures
and
operations
that
accompanied
and
followed
conventional
wars
previous
civilizations
have
been
harried
hectored
and
undermined
by
migrating
barbarians
who
had
heard
of
accumulated
wealth
and
had
come
to
share
or
perhaps
to
take
over
the
and
lick
up
the
honey
western
civilization
has
faced
the
problem
of
migration
intensified
by
population
explosion
but
the
barbarians
who
are
tearing
the
social
body
of
western
civilization
limb
from
limb
are
not
outsiders
invading
a
civilization
in
order
to
plunder
and
sack
it
but
the
offspring
of
civilized
affluent
communities
who
have
repudiated
the
acquisition
and
accumulation
of
material
goods
and
services
turning
instead
to
the
satiation
of
body
hungers
and
the
freedom
of
social
irresponsibility
western
man
has
spent
ten
centuries
in
building
a
civilization
aimed
at
economic
stability
and
social
security
for
the
privileged
the
new
barbarian
progeny
have
rejected
this
civilization
of
affluence
and
are
busily
engaged
in
fragmenting
the
social
apparatus
that
has
made
affluence
possible
in
a
word
western
civilization
has
organized
and
coordinated
but
in
the
process
it
has
sowed
the
seeds
of
disorganization
and
chaos
one
last
word
about
the
effect
of
western
civilization
on
human
society
the
west
has
littered
and
cluttered
the
planet
with
an
immense
variety
and
with
enormous
quantities
of
gimmicks
and
gadgets
from
tin
cans
to
airplanes
that
fly
faster
than
sound
and
rockets
that
carry
their
occupants
to
the
moon
western
productivity
has
multiplied
greatly
too
often
it
has
utility
ignored
quality
and
outraged
beauty
more
often
than
not
its
goods
services
institutions
practices
and
ideas
have
remained
at
the
surface
without
reaching
down
to
essentials
if
life
can
be
fragmented
into
physical
mental
emotional
energetic
spiritual
and
creative
it
must
be
evident
that
the
western
way
has
smothered
life
more
significant
aspects
under
a
blanket
of
trivialities
and
inconsequentials
western
civilization
has
stressed
competition
aimed
at
the
acquisition
and
accumulation
of
material
goods
and
services
the
competitive
struggle
in
its
civilian
and
military
aspects
has
played
fast
and
loose
with
the
contents
of
nature
storehouse
through
uncounted
ages
mother
nature
has
set
up
a
balance
among
the
multitude
of
aspects
and
differentiated
forms
that
have
existed
and
still
exist
on
the
planet
humanity
has
increasingly
upset
this
balance
of
nature
ignorantly
and
often
stupidly
without
pausing
to
determine
the
resultant
changes
nowhere
is
this
upset
more
in
evidence
than
the
changes
in
climate
and
animal
life
and
their
possibilities
of
survival
brought
about
by
the
erosion
of

the
story
it
can
be
summed
up
in
four
words
deforestation
overgrazing

drifting

another
aspect
of
man
aggressions
against
nature
is
the
wanton
destruction
of
wildlife
like
the
american
bison
and
the
wood
pigeon
still
another
example
is
the
extraction
from
the
earth
crust
of
minerals
and
metals
accumulated
through
ages
and
used
to
turn
out
frivolous
gadgets
or
more
disastrously
the
materials
and
machines
of
civilized
warfare
instead
of
conserving
natural
wealth
rationing
it
and
thus
extending
its
use
to
succeeding
generations
western
man
has
burnt
it
up
in
the
firestorms
deliberately
kindled
during
the
seven
disaster
years
from
to
in
the
course
of
its
existence
western
civilization
has
replaced
food
gatherers
cultivators
and
artisans
by
hucksters
and
professional
destroyers
of
mankind
and
ravagers
of
the
living

afforded

western
civilization
has
done
its
most
disservice
to
mankind
by

five
features
common
to
civilizations
each
civilization
that
has
left
legible
records
or
significant
traditions
during
the
past
five
or
six
thousand
years
has
made
distinctive
contributions
that
modified
the
culture
pattern
of
its
predecessors
and
its
contemporaries
at
the
same
time
all
of
the
civilizations
have
had
certain
common
features
that
are
the
characteristic
aspects
which
justify
the
general
definition
of
civilization
presented
in
the
introduction
to
this
study
civilization
is
the
most
comprehensive
extensive
and
inclusive
life
pattern
achieved
by
terrestrial
humanity
starting
locally
and
following
the
three
basic
principles
of
urbanization
expansion
and
exploitation
each
civilization
has
charted
a
course
that
led
from
tentative
local
beginnings
through
a
cycle
of
growth
maturity
decline
decay
and
dissolution
the
civilizing
process
is
essentially
collective
subordinating
the
interests
of
each
part
to
the
interests
of
the
whole
while
allowing
sufficient
home
rule
to
enable
each
part
to
have
the
political
economic
and
cultural
advantages
enjoyed
by
the
other
parts
always
excepting
the
privileged
position
occupied
by
the
civilization
dominant
empire
and
its
nucleus
necessarily
a
civilization
is
composed
of
more
or
less
disparate
segments
each
one
before
its
inclusion
in
the
collective
whole
maintaining
a
large
measure
of
sovereign
independence
utilizing
advanced
techniques
of
communication
exchange
and
transportation
the
separate
sovereign
units
are
coordinated
consolidated
unified
and
universalized
the
result
is
an
aggregate
of
parts
differing
in
many
local
respects
but
acknowledging
the
authority
of
the
power
center
and
contributing
material
goods
and
manpower
to
its
support
and
defense
the
main
sociological
purpose
of
each
civilization
has
been
to
impose
central
authority
and
universality
upon
political
economic
and
ideological
diversity
every
civilization
has
been
confronted
with
the
advantages
of
unity
over
diversity
every
civilization
has
professed
its
devotion
to
unity
every
civilization
at
one
or
another
stage
in
its
development
has
subordinated
unity
to
the
increasingly
insistent
demands
of
diversity
for
at
least
six
thousand
years
one
civilization
after
another
has
sought
to
achieve
centralization
and
universality
in
every
instance
of
which
history
provides
a
legible
record
centralized
universalized
institutions
and
practices
have
fragmented
into
diversity
and
stubborn
localism
western
civilization
is
part
and
parcel
of
this
generalization
generation
by
generation
and
century
by
century
it
has
professed
and
proclaimed
the
advantages
of
universality
while
it
yielded
to
the
persistent
demands
of
nationalism
regionalism
and
localism
throughout
the
latter
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
will
to
unify
gained
much
ground
the
tide
turned
with
the
turn
of
the
century
for
the
first
half
of
the
present
century
the
forces
of
unity
and
of
diversity
seemed
stalemated
war
end
in
saw
the
shadow
of
a
universal
state
flicker
across
the
screen
of
history
with
the
adjournment
of
the
bandung
conference
in
the
shadow
dissolved
and
was
replaced
by
the
strident
nationalisms
that
have
become
an
outstanding
feature
of
planetary
politics
economics
and
social
organization
despite
the
insistence
of
reason
and
experience
that
strength
and
stability
are
the
result
of
unity
tradition
custom
and
habit
have
held
human
society
at
the
level
of
political
economic
and
ideological
diversity
nowhere
in
history
is
this
generalization
more
emphatic
than
in
the
failure
of
the
european
of
western
civilization
to
replace
a
millennium
of
diversity
discord
and
conflict
by
a
unified
coordinated
cooperating
european
community
at
its
best
a
civilization
is
insecure
and
even
unstable
disturbed
and
upset
by
an
increasing
domestic
struggle
for
preferment
and
power
that
includes
rivalry
competition
revolt
rebellion
civil
war
and
wars
of
carried
on
by
unassimilated
regional
provincial
and
colonial
elements
from
beyond
their
frontiers
civilizations
have
been
assailed
by
rival
aspirants
for
power
by
armed
bands
in
search
of
plunder
or
by
migrating
peoples
seeking
greener
pastures
all
of
these
forces
have
held
the
ground
for
diversity
and
barred
the
way
to
universality
another
factor
of
great
consequence
leading
to
the
instability
of
civilizations
has
been
the
concentration
of
wealth
power
privilege
comfort
and
security
in
the
hands
of
a
minority
in
sharp
contrast
with
poverty
and
insecurity
among
the
less
majority
generally
the
privileged
minority
has
been
relatively
small
and
the
exploited
majority
overwhelmingly
large
still
another
disturbing
factor
in
each
civilization
is
the
transformation
of
its
military
arm
from
a
means
of
defense
against
external
enemies
into
a
major
factor
in
the
direction
of
domestic
affairs
the
professional
military
has
frequently
usurped
the
state
power
and
became
by
virtue
of
its
monopoly
of
weapons
organization
and
its
highly
trained
personnel
of
professional
destroyers
and
killers
upset
by
one
or
another
of
these
disturbing
and
disruptive
forces
civilized
populations
have
panicked
and
retreated
from
their
collectiveness
toward
more
localized
more
fragmented
less
social
and
more
individual
life
patterns
such
a
retreat
rounds
out
the
later
phases
of
a
cycle
of
civilization
the
phases
of
decline
and
final
dissolution
civilizations
perish
in
the
first
instance
because
of
internal
contradictions
and
conflicts
the
struggle
to
grab
monopolize
and
keep
wealth
status
power
they
perish
because
of
the
division
of
the
nucleus
and
its
associates
and
dependencies
between
those
who
work
for
a
living
those
who
have
an
unearned
income
and
those
parasites
who
scrounge
for
a
living
they
perish
because
of
the
hard
class
and
caste
lines
that
grow
out
of
economic
contradictions
because
of
the
development
of
a
social
pyramid
layer
above
layer
until
the
summit
is
reached
where
there
is
standing
room
for
only
a
few
competent
talented
persons
may
rise
from
level
to
level
in
this
pyramid
a
political
and
social
bureaucracy
develops
which
feeds
at
the
public
trough
then
comes
a
bitter
struggle
to
get
both
feet
in
the
trough
and
keep
them
there
side
by
side
with
an
equally
determined
effort
to
exclude
outsiders
and
other
intruders
an
army
of
volunteers
and
novices
is
converted
into
a
military
establishment
which
becomes
a
state
within
the
state
extending
its
control
until
it
makes
policy
selects
top
leaderships
and
carries
on
its
internal
feuds
and
wars
of
succession
dividing
the
defense
forces
and
using
them
for
partisan
purposes
overhead
costs
rise
deficits
in
the
public
treasury
grow
so
does
public
debt
inflation
follows
and
the
debasement
of
the
currency
levies
are
made
on
private
wealth
for
public
purposes
there
is
expropriation
of
the
property
of
political
enemies
espionage
secret
agents
the
growth
of
informers
become
part
of
the
society
along
with
the
use
of
assassination
as
a
political
weapon
the
increase
of
violence
and
crime
and
eventually
a
flight
from
the
cities
this
tragic
enumeration
only
skims
the
surface
of
the
many
and
various
aspects
of
a
situation
that
reaches
its
breaking
point
in
civil
war
famine
pestilence
and
eventually
in
depopulation
social
dissolution
is
accelerated
by
provincial
revolts
against
central
authority
by
survival
struggle
between
the
empires
which
were
coordinated
and
consolidated
into
the
civilization
by

the
subordinate
and

rivalry
and
conflict
between
racial

and

forced
into

there
by
coercion
policed
by
armed
force
and
taking
the
first
opportunity
to
win
political
independence
and
self
determination
while
the
momentum
for
expansion
lasted
the
civilization
grew
in
wealth
and
power
when
it
waned
disintegration
set
in
changelessness
seems
to
be
impossible
in
a
social
group
a
civilization
either
expands
or
withers
builds
up
or
falls
to
pieces
starting
from
one
or
more
local
groups
each
civilization
has
reached
out
to
conquer
the
world
occupy
it
organize
it
dominate
it
exploit
it
perpetuate
itself
in
each
case
expansion
occupation
domination
and
exploitation
are
limited
by
human
capacity
human
nature
by
the
relative
brevity
of
a
single
human
life
by
the
extreme
variations
in
the
capacity
of
successive
leaders
it
is
limited
by
geography
by
the
means
of
transportation
and
communication
by
overhead

that

has
this

that

proved
to
be
false
and
misleading
civilization
in
the
is
unstable
and
insecure
most
civilizations
are
strangled
in
their
cradles
or
plundered
and
demolished
in
the
course
of
the
political
economic
and
military
conflicts
which
have
marked
and
marred
civilizations
since
the
dawn
of
history
the
national
and
imperial
survivors
of
these
struggles
in
every
known
instance
have
been
largely
or
wholly
led
by
military
adventurers
and
plunderers
in
search
of
booty
fame
and
power
with
professional
plunderers
destroyers
and
murderers
occupying
the
seats
of
power
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
and
occasion
before
rising
overhead
costs
and
the
misfortunes
of
war
result
in
their
overthrow
and
replacement
by
better
organized
better
armed

who

and

their
predecessors
and
usurp
and
abuse
their
power
of
necessity
civilizations
are
built
as
they
are
on
the
ebb
and
flow
of
power
struggle
successive
conflicts
involve
an
indefinite
volume
of
overhead
costs
which
grow
with
the
intensity
and
extent
of
the
expansive
survival
struggle
creating
a
series
of
crises
along
a
path
that
leads
to
and
the
return
of
the
experimenters
to
a
condition
of
we
in
the
west
looking
back
on
our
own
immediate
history
refer
to
this
status
as
the
dark
ages
actually
such
dark
ages
are
the
transition
stages
between
two
periods
of
experiments
with
the
building
of
civilizations
in
view
of
this
experience
modern
man
must
look
upon
an
epoch
of
civilization
not
as
a
way
of
life
but
an
adventure
of
suicidal
and
ultimate
each
cycle
of
civilization
has
had
its
peculiarities
determined
by
the
geographical
and
historical
factors
surrounding
its
origin
and
development
yet
all
have
had
features
in
common
among
the
common
features
we
would
list
a
revolutionary
movement
within
the
societies
under
consideration
in
each
experiment
with
civilization
the
culture
pattern
was
transformed
from
pastoral
agricultural
to
a
culture
based
on
trade
commerce
and
finance
from
rural
to
urban
from
simple
to
complex
from
local
toward
universal
in
each
case
an
independent
expanding
state
was
built
around
an
urban
center
in
each
experiment
a
simple
local
social
structure
was
extended
expanded
specialized

consolidated
in
each
experiment
a

static
society
passed
into
the
control
of
an
emerging
class

peddlers

and
professionals
who
were
not
directly
involved
in
the
conversion
of
nature
gifts
into
goods
and
services
ready
for
human
use
but
in
political
and
cultural
practices
which
enabled
the
emerging
bourgeois
class
to
stabilize
and
extend
its
wealth
and
power
and
build
an
economic
structure
that
augmented
unearned
income
and
laid
the
foundation
for
predation
exploitation
and
parasitism
in
each
experiment
an
amateur

for

matured
into

enlarging
the
geographical
area
and
strengthening
the
economic
and
political
authority
of
the
new
classes
in

and
each
civilization
there
was
an
evolution
of

from
voluntary
to
professional
status
from

in

there
was
a
competitive

between

each
passing
through
the
transformation
the
result
was
an
increasing
conflict
for
survival
for
expansion
and
for
local
supremacy

expanded
along
lines
that
led
the
more

to
build

of

chapter
six
the
politics
of
civilization
several
thousand
years
ago
humankind
began
experimenting
with
the
life
style
which
we
are
now
calling
civilization
presumably
it
was
not
thought
out
and
blueprinted
in
advance
but
worked
out
by
trial
and
error
episode
by
episode
step
by
step
perhaps
also
leap
by
leap
historical
and
contemporary
experiments
with
this
lifestyle
supply
a
fund
of
valuable
information
some
of
which
has
been
covered
in
the
earlier
chapters
of
this
book
our
next
task
is
to
analyze
and
classify
this
information
under
four
headings
the
politics
the
economics
the
sociology
and
the
ideology
of
civilization
when
the
information
is
properly
arranged
we
can
do
something
with
it
and
about
it
politics
is
the
part
of
social
science
and
engineering
which
is
concerned
with
the
organization
direction
and
administration
of
human
communities
we
use
the
word
to
cover
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
in
any
social
group
more
extensive
than
a
family
hence
we
refer
to
village
politics
town
politics
national
politics
international
politics
and
in
the
present
instance
to
the
politics
of
civilization
as
a
way
of
life
each
sample
referred
to
in
our
examination
of
typical
civilizations
was
built
around
a
center
nucleus
or
homeland
consisting
of
one
or
more
cities
with
their
adjacent
hinterlands
the
nucleus
of
the
developing
civilization
was
also
the
nucleus
of
an
empire
each
nucleus
was
a
center
of
planned
production
accumulating
wealth
growing
population
and
expanding
authority
certain
locations
are
better
suited
than
others
to
provide
the
essentials
of
a
civilization
nucleus
the
first
requirement
for
a
nucleus
is
a
tolerable
climate
primarily
a
satisfactory
balance
between
heat
and
cold
before
the
general
use
of
fire
as
a
source
of
warmth
human
populations
were
concentrated
at
or
near
the
tropics
with
the
increasing
use
of
artificial
heating
and
lighting
human
beings
were
able
to
cluster
farther
and
farther
away
from
concentrated
equatorial
sunlight
the
second
requirement
of
such
a
location
is
a
strategic
position
in
a
crossroads
in
a
network
of
transportation
and
communication
the
third
requirement
is
a
readily
available
source
of
the
food
and
building
materials
necessary
to
feed
house
and
clothe
a
community
and
provide
it
with
some
of
the
niceties
of
daily
living
the
fourth
requirement
is
the
presence
of
sufficient
to
operate
the
nucleus
and
provide
a
surplus
for
defense
and
for
its
extension
and
expansion
the
fifth
requirement
is
defensibility
against
aggression
or
invasion
the
sixth
essential
is
the
availability
of
sufficient
raw
materials
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
nucleus
provide
the
exports
needed
to
maintain
a
favorable
trade
balance
for
the
nucleus
and
permit
of
its
expansion
advancement
and
enrichment
seventh
and
in
some
ways
the
most
important
requirement
for
the
establishing
of
an
empire
or
a
civilization
nucleus
is
the
presence
of
a
will
to
live
a
will
to
grow
a
will
to
advance
competence
in
management
and
a
dogged
persistence
that
will
remain
constant
through
generations
or
centuries
of
adversity
and
still
more
demanding
through
long
periods
of
security
comfort
and
affluence
eighth
and
by
no
means
least
important
is
the
capacity
to
fight
and
win
the
aggressive
trade
and
military
wars
incidental
to
the
defense
and
expansion
of
the
nucleus
of
the
empire
and
eventually
of
the
civilization
the
ninth
requirement
is
tolerance
receptivity
to
new
ideas
and
practices
the
capacity
to
adapt
and
to
assimilate
the
outside
elements
which
are
constantly
incorporated
into
the
growing
expanding
empire
or
the
civilization
finally
as
we
read
the
history
and
observe
the
development
of
nuclei
empires
and
civilizations
we
are
impressed
by
the
role
of
outstanding
individuals
who
occupy
positions
of
responsibility
over
sufficiently
long
periods
or
with
sufficient
intensity
to
leave
a
lasting
impression
on
the
ideas
practices
and
institutions
of
their
times
this
requirement
covers
the
practice
of
effective
leadership
our
concern
at
this
point
lies
primarily
with
the
first
eight
of
these
requirements
for
survival
and
success
in
building
up
empires
and
civilizations
empires
and
civilizations
are
established
during
periods
of
social
expansion
when
the
and
urges
are
widely
felt
the
surge
produces
not
a
single
center
of
growth
and
expansion
but
dozens
or
scores
of
competitors
each
aiming
to
win
and
keep
a
position
well
in
advance
of
its
rivals
the
resulting
and
which
usually
lasts
for
centuries
is
a
characteristic
and
recurring
feature
in
the
political
life
of
every
civilization
this
statement
is
less
a
requirement
for
success
in
organizing
the
nucleus
of
a
civilization
than
a
generalization
about
the
natural
and
social
milieu
out
of
which
competing
nuclei
arise
success
of
one
among
the
many
competitors
is
a
characteristic
feature
of
the
struggle
for
nuclear
survival
development
and
perhaps
for
eventual
supremacy
from
earliest
times
waterways
have
provided
the
readiest
means
of
getting
about
all
that
was
needed
was
a
hollow
log
a
raft
a
primitive
canoe
movement
by
land
was
impeded
by
mountains
deserts
forests
swamps
water
courses
movement
by
water
was
a
natural
more
and
bigger
boats
required
shelter
against
storms
and
protection
against
destruction
by
enemies
a
good
harbor
with
an
adjacent
walled
town
or
city
was
the
answer
to
this
need
good
harbors
and
navigable
waterways
are
notably
absent
along
the
west
coast
of
south
america
and
notably
present
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
consequently
the
south
american
west
coast
line
is
sparsely
settled
to
this
day
while
the
eastern
mediterranean
has
been
crowded
with
peoples
teemed
with
trade
and
commerce
carried
largely
by
sea
between
cities
that
occupied
the
best
access
to
waterways
safe
harbors
and
navigable
waterways
made
trade
and
transport
easy
and
cheap
as
each
wave
of
human
advance
turned
from
animal
husbandry
and
agriculture
to
bourgeois
practices
of
industry
commerce
and
finance
locations
at
strategic
points
along
trade
routes
were
first
occupied
by
occasional
markets
and
fairs
and
eventually
by
trading
towns
and
cities
geography
was
a
decisive
factor
fertility
was
equally
important
in
the
early
stages
of
social
development
transportation
was
difficult
dangerous
and
expensive
sources
of
food
and
building
materials
were
found
within
a
short
distance
of
the
growing
trade
center
again
geography
played
a
decisive
role
a
deep
sheltered
harbor
backed
by
a
desert
could
not
attract
and
support
a
thriving
trade
center
food
and
raw
materials
are
indispensable
to
concentrations
of
human
beings
the
nile
valley
like
that
of
the
ganges
and
the
yellow
river
provided
the
fertility
and
transport
the
food
and
raw
materials
that
have
sustained
concentrated
human
populations
for
many
thousands
of
years
forming
part
of
the
base
for
egyptian
indian
and
chinese
civilizations
animal
husbandry
and
grain
farming
coupled
with
fishing
and
forestry
made
possible
the
growth
of
cities
and
laid
the
foundations
for
the
nuclei
of
these
civilizations
temples
tombs
and
other
public
constructs
provided
the
centers
around
which
egyptian
civilization
was
built
the
stone
wood
and
other
raw
materials
used
in
the
building
of
these
unique
examples
of
human
handiwork
were
floated
up
and
down
the
nile
from
their
sources
of
origin
annual
nile
floods
provided
silt
deposits
necessary
to
fertilize
farms
and
gardens
nile
water
impounded
during
floods
irrigated
the
land
during
the
long
dry
seasons
banked
by
deserts
the
nile
was
a
ribbon
of
fertility
running
through
a
largely
uninhabited
wilderness
the
upper
reaches
of
the
nile
lay
in
the
mountains
of
central
africa
the
nile
delta
built
up
through
ages
by
silt
deposits
provided
a
meeting
place
where
african
european
and
asian
traders
could
exchange
their
wares
and
lay
the
foundations
for
the
civilization
of
lower
egypt
the
nile
also
provided
the
means
of
communication
which
connected
lower
egypt
with
upper
egypt
and
led
finally
to
the
unification
of
the
two
areas
in
a
long
enduring
and
prestigious
egyptian
civilization
once
again
geography
was
laying
down
the
guide
lines
within
which
civilizations
have
been
built
up
and
liquidated
thus
far
we
have
noted
the
role
of
physiographic
factors
that
have
led
to
building
the
nuclei
of
empires
and
civilizations
they
have
been
parallelled
by
social
factors
as
men
took
advantage
of
natural
opportunities
to
concentrate
feed
and
house
ever
larger
human
aggregates
empires
and
civilizations
have
been
built
up
by
comparatively
large
numbers
of
human
beings
concentrated
in
relatively
small
spaces
wandering
food
gatherers
and
herdsmen
ranged
widely
in
search
of
game
and
grass
cultivators
settled
in
villages
from
which
they
could
work
the
land
if
crops
were
scanty
population
was
sparse
only
abundant
crops
dependable
season
after
season
provided
the
basis
for
large
settled
populations
large
settled
populations
adequately
supplied
with
the
essentials
of
life
enabled
human
beings
to
organize
social
centers
in
which
a
comparatively
few
people
tending
their
animals
and
working
the
land
could
release
a
comparatively
large
part
of
the
population
to
devote
its
time
and
energy
to
trade
and
commerce
to
industry
and
transport
to
the
arts
and
sciences
and
to
the
organization
direction
and
administration
of
large
scale
enterprises
such
as
government
the
military
construction
and
the
mobilization
of
sufficient
labor
power
to
carry
on
and
enlarge
their
enterprises
in
its
simplest
essence
this
was
politics
egyptian
government
in
its
broad
sense
rested
on
a
class
structured
society
the
aristocracy
the
priesthood
officialdom
businessmen
highly
trained
scientists
and
engineers
skilled
craftsmen
and
an
immense
proletariat
consisting
of
tenant
farmers
peons
slaves
and
war
captives
at
the
top
of
the
political
structure
was
an
absolute
monarch
who
wielded
power
that
was
limited
only
by
the
ambition
tolerance
and
loyalty
of
his
associates
nobles
priests
soldiers
businessmen
and
political
advisers
and
by
the
willingness
of
the
rural
and
urban
masses
to
work
and
fight
for
their
overlords
a
number
of
the
monarchs
pharaohs
ruled
for
long
periods
up
to
sixty
years
it
was
during
these
long
reigns
that
the
egyptian
kingdom
was
organized
strengthened
and
unified
the
rule
of
the
monarch
was
safeguarded
ambitious
nobles
were
placated
or
destroyed
and
the
leadership
succession
was
determined
and
assured
the
nucleus
of
the
egyptian
empire
was
a
dictatorship
by
a
elite
headed
by
lords
spiritual
and
temporal
both
groups
held
land
accumulated
wealth
and
exercised
authority
it
was
a
government
combining
the
theory
of
absolutism
with
the
practice
of
public
responsibility
it
was
sufficiently
arbitrary
to
get
things
done
it
was
sufficiently
inclusive
to
recognize
and
utilize
special
ability
it
was
sufficiently
structured
to
carry
on
from
dynasty
to
dynasty
it
was
sufficiently
flexible
to
consolidate
scattered
communities
into
the
old
kingdom
to
unite
lower
and
upper
egypt
to
extend
its
authority
into
central
africa
the
near
and
middle
east
and
parts
of
eastern
europe
thus
laying
the
foundations
for
history
most
extensive
and
civilization
during
the
period
to
i
have
used
the
egyptian
example
of
nucleus
organization
because
of
the
phenomenal
successes
achieved
by
the
egyptians
in
maintaining
an
empire
for
at
least
years
for
a
considerable
part
of
those
thirty
centuries
egypt
was
top
dog
in
the
strategic
area
where
africa
joins
eurasia
the
nucleus
is
the
hub
from
which
the
spokes
of
empire
and
of
civilization
radiate
the
radius
of
authority
and
the
vast
stretches
of
occupied
exploited
territory
constitute
the
circumference
of
the
wheel
the
nucleus
is
the
center
of
wealth
and
power
surrounded
by
a
cluster
of
associates
and
dependencies
the
control
direction
and
administration
of
the
nucleus
is
parallelled
by
the
control
direction
and
administration
of
the
total
complex
the
empire
the
civilization
the
development
from
nucleus
to
empire
and
from
empire
to
civilization
creates
three
sets
of
political
problems
those
arising
from
the
administration
of
the
nucleus
those
arising
out
of
contacts
between
the
nucleus
and
the
circumference
between
the
associates
and
dependencies
and
the
nucleus
and
those
arising
out
of
the
determination
of
the
associates
and
dependencies
to
sever
their
connections
with
the
nucleus
win
their
independence
and
take
part
in
the
unceasing
efforts
to
establish
new
nuclei
win
the
unending
power
struggle
and
shift
the
power
center
relationship
between
nucleus
and
periphery
are
the
normal
outcome
of
the
expansion
of
a
nucleus
into
an
empire
each
growing
urban
center
reaches
out
for
an
extension
of
its
territory
for
the
food
and
raw
materials
required
by
a
growing
population
for
markets
that
can
absorb
the
goods
and
services
exported
by
the
urban
center
to
pay
for
its
necessary
imports
of
food
and
raw
materials
politically
speaking
the
essential
problem
is
to
maintain
a
relationship
that
will
keep
the
imports
coming
in
and
keep
the
exports
going
out
imports
may
take
the
form
of
plunder
seized
by
the
strong
in
contacts
and
conflicts
with
weaker
neighbors
tribute
paid
by
the
weak
to
the
strong
at
the
insistence
of
the
strong
or
trade
in
which
each
side
gains
something
empire
building
involves
all
three
methods
in
virtually
all
instances
the
nucleus
is
richer
and
stronger
the
periphery
is
poorer
and
weaker
in
virtually
all
instances
these
relative
positions
have
been
the
outcome
of
military
operations
in
which
each
party
has
tried
to
impose
its
will
upon
its
rivals
in
each
case
the
spoils
went
to
the
victor
who
forced
defeated
rivals
to
cede
territory
to
pay
tribute
to
give
hostages
or
in
some
other
fashion
to
agree
upon
a
settlement
that
left
the
victor
richer
and
stronger
and
the
vanquished
poorer
and
weaker
politically
speaking
the
relation
of
nucleus
to
periphery
was
that
of
superior
to
inferior
where
the
discrepancy
was
very
great
it
resulted
in
a
relation
of
master
and
vassal
or
even
master
and
slave
an
empire
or
a
civilization
consisting
of
a
center
and
a
periphery
of
associated
and
dependent
territories
and
peoples
led
to
a
differential
in
favor
of
the
center
it
also
involved
the
establishment
of
a
political
apparatus
strong
enough
to
perpetuate
the
relationship
by
collecting
tribute
and
taxes
from
the
weak
and
depositing
them
in
the
treasure
chests
of
the
strong
the
outcome
was
a
civil
bureaucracy
backed
by
a
military
or
police
strong
enough
to
defend
and
perpetuate
an
unpalatable
position
once
established
both
the
civilian
bureaucracy
and
the
military
apparatus
tended
to
maintain
themselves
to
extend
their
privileges
and
strengthen
their
positions
since
controversial
issues
domestic
and
foreign
are
generally
decided
by
force
or
the
threat
of
force
the
military
became
the
strong
right
arm
of
authority
these
confrontations
and
contradictions
created
three
sets
of
political
problems
centralism
versus
localism
established
central
authority
versus
provincial
rights
and
the
concentration
or
centralization
of
authority
in
the
hands
of
a
select
few
civilian
military
leaders
responsible
to
the
central
authority
who
made
on
the
spot
decisions
and
took
action
under
the
institutions
and
practices
of
civilized
society
the
select
few
were
in
a
position
to
call
in
the
military
which
was
organized
for
emergency
action
and
was
constantly
the
military
was
trained
disciplined
and
held
a
monopoly
of
weapons
civilizations
frequently
begin
as
commonwealths
or
federations
forged
in
the
course
of
survival
struggle
in
any
such
struggle
the
military
will
of
necessity
play
a
major
role
as
the
competitive
survival
struggle
develops
one
of
the
contending
parties
establishes
its
superiority
by
winning
military
victory
in
the
course
of
this
struggle
the
commonwealth
a
cluster
of
equals
yields
place
to
the
pattern
of
empire
a
center
of
wealth
and
authority
with
its
associates
subordinates
and
dependencies
the
strong
right
arm
of
politics
includes
money
and
weapons
the
politics
of
civilization
faces
a
simple
mandate
establish
stabilize
and
perpetuate
a
nucleus
of
wealth
and
authority
build
around
the
nucleus
a
periphery
of
associates
and
dependencies
historically
the
process
was
a
long
one
extending
through
generations
and
probably
centuries
throughout
the
struggle
individuals
must
have
the
necessities
of
daily
life
community
activities
must
be
housed
equipped
staffed
supported
pastoral
and
village
life
were
based
on
a
use
economy
people
produced
what
they
needed
and
consumed
their
own
products
each
tribe
family
village
was
a
more
or
less
unit
when
they
were
threatened
or
invaded
people
defended
themselves
as
best
they
could
at
worst
they
abandoned
their
homes
to
the
invaders
and
fled
into
the
forests
mountains
or
deserts
towns
and
cities
with
their
industries
trade
commerce
their
permanent
housing
and
capital
equipment
faced
a
radically
different
situation
since
they
could
not
carry
their
wealth
on
their
backs
they
must
stay
put
and
defend
themselves
or
face
irreparable
losses
defense
required
careful
extensive
expensive
preparations
walls
equipment
stored
food
personnel
unless
the
city
was
sacked
and
burned
during
survival
struggles
it
remained
as
a
vantage
point
to
be
held
at
all
costs
if
surrendered
and
occupied
by
assailants
it
was
equally
valuable
to
invaders
who
were
prepared
to
settle
down
take
advantage
of
the
site
the
capital
equipment
and
exploit
the
available
manpower
whether
occupied
by
friend
or
enemy
towns
and
cities
were
centers
of
actual
or
potential
wealth
and
power
they
were
also
consumers
of
goods
and
services
many
of
which
could
not
be
food
must
come
from
herdsmen
or
farmers
building
materials
must
come
from
forests
or
mines
such
raw
materials
the
essentials
of
daily
life
must
be
brought
into
urban
centers
when
and
as
wanted
food
and
raw
materials
could
be
secured
occasionally
by
plunder
a
regular
supply
depended
on
trade
and
commerce
or
on
tribute
levied
and
collected
periodically
from
associated
or
dependent
peoples
in
the
long
run
trade
and
commerce
proved
to
be
more
reliable
and
more
productive
than
plunder
as
urban
centers
grew
and
developed
they
established
regular
channels
of
trade
and
communication
by
land
and
water
along
these
channels
needed
imports
moved
into
the
urban
centers
and
exports
in
exchange
moved
from
the
urban
centers
into
the
back
country
or
the
provinces
at
every
stage
in
the
process
care
must
be
taken
to
prevent
intervention
by
thieves
robbers
or
envious
rivals
two
devices
were
used
to
meet
this
situation
money
to
facilitate
exchange
and
a
defense
organization
to
deal
with
intruders
money
and
its
uses
developed
money
changers
money
lenders
and
banks
bankers
and
banks
exchanged
currency
at
a
profit
and
extended
credit
weapons
in
the
hands
of
trained
personnel
evolved
into
locally
employed
police
and
centrally
organized
armed
services
performing
police
functions
and
fighting
wars
domestic
and
foreign
politics
local
regional
or
national
developed
with
the
growth
of
population
the
profits
of
expanding
urban
life
production
technology
as
its
scope
broadened
geographically
city
survival
depended
increasingly
on
wealth
and
power
money
and
weapons
during
periods
of
peace
and
stability
the
civil
authorities
controlled
public
affairs
in
emergencies
such
as
natural
disasters
invasion
civil
or
international
wars
the
military
authorities
took
command
military
authority
is
an
institutional
feature
of
every
civilization
in
periods
of
public
danger
it
enjoys
complete
ascendancy
like
civil
authority
the
military
is
a
permanent
and
frequently
the
dominant
feature
of
each
civilization
it
is
assured
of
ample
income
and
entrusted
with
the
installations
and
implements
of
war
making
both
in
income
and
in
prestige
the
military
holds
a
preferred
position
since
military
functions
center
about
destroying
the
person
and
property
of
the
enemy
domestic
or
foreign
public
funds
are
made
available
or
are
by
the
military
during
periods
of
martial
law
as
a
civilization
becomes
more
complex
and
extensive
the
funds
at
the
disposal
of
the
military
tend
to
increase
the
same
factors
of
extent
and
complexity
lead
to
larger
and
larger
numbers
of
confrontations
and
conflicts
in
which
the
military
is
called
upon
to
play
the
leading
role
increasingly
therefore
the
military
is
at
the
center
of
policy
making
finally
a
point
is
reached
at
which
war
civil
colonial
or
international
is
always
in
progress
somewhere
within
the
territories
occupied
by
the
civilization
at
such
periods
civil
law
slumbers
and
military
authority
is
more
or
less
dominant
and
permanent
under
the
slogan
defense
of
civilization
military
necessity
and
military
adventurism
shape
public
policy
empty
the
public
treasury
bankrupt
and
eventually
destroy
the
superstructure
of
a
civilization
the
nucleus
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
an
empire
or
a
civilization
has
a
political
life
cycle
that
runs
from
the
unstructured
or
little
structured
aggregation
of
confederation
or
local
groups
to
a
highly
centralized
political
absolutism
holding
and
exercising
its
authority
by
the
use
of
the
military
the
steps
in
this
process
have
been
clearly
marked
in
earlier
civilizations
they
are
playing
a
decisive
role
in
the
life
of
western
civilization
they
extend
from
early
forms
of
government
under
leaders
selected
or
elected
by
popular
acclaim
or
at
least
by
popular
consent
to
more
or
less
permanent
leadership
enjoying
many
political
privileges
including
the
selection
of
its
successors
under
the
pressure
of
social
emergency
engendered
within
the
social
group
or
imposed
from
outside
the
group
by
migration
intrusion
or
invasion
leadership
takes
the
measures
which
it
considers
necessary
to
preserve
extend
its
authority
each
emergency
offers
leadership
an
opportunity
or
an
excuse
to
custom
law
overlook
whatever
public
opinion
may
exist
and
proceed
to
the
measures
needed
to
meet
the
emergency
in
each
organized
social
group
the
exercise
of
authority
has
provided
the
leadership
with
a
of
money
and
weapons
in
the
hands
of
a
permanent
military
elite
the
use
of
this
elite
to
deal
with
the
emergency
is
accepted
by
civil
authority
as
a
matter
of
course
when
social
division
of
function
has
produced
and
armed
a
military
elite
leadership
turns
to
this
elite
in
any
emergency
arising
from
natural
disaster
or
social
crisis
the
outcome
is
a
community
directed
by
a
military
arm
seeking
to
perpetuate
and
enlarge
its
own
role
in
the
determination
and
exercise
of
public
authority
using
any
means
which
seems
likely
to
produce
the
desired
results
politically
therefore
any
expanding
empire
or
civilization
reaches
a
point
at
which
absolute
monarchy
exercising
unquestioned
authority
makes
and
enforces
public
policy
by
the
use
of
the
military
or
with
its
help
many
commentators
write
as
though
the
essence
of
civilization
was
its
art
galleries
concert
halls
its
universities
and
its
libraries
such
agencies
are
the
trappings
decorations
and
fringes
of
a
civilization
there
is
no
justification
for
such
a
selective
approach
the
strong
of
every
civilization
has
been
its
wealth
money
and
its
martial
equipment
its
guns
success
in
politics
has
been
described
as
the
art
of
selecting
the
possible
and
bringing
it
to
fruition
every
community
is
more
or
less
fragmented
by
deviations
contradictions
confrontations
and
conflicts
these
fragmentations
begin
in
the
personality
and
extend
through
the
entire
social
structure
from
the
individual
through
the
family
such
voluntary
associations
as
the
sports
club
the
trade
union
the
merchants
association
the
educational
system
the
political
party
the
municipal
or
the
national
government
unrestrained
and
undirected
social
fragmentation
leads
to
conflict
destruction
perhaps
to
chaos
success
in
politics
rests
on
an
understanding
of
the
chaos
and
its
causes
and
an
integration
of
conflicting
forces
behind
specific
programs
and
around
charismatic
personalities
one
aspect
of
the
problem
is
especially
disturbing
and
baffling
to
the
uninitiated
compared
with
the
brief
adulthood
of
an
individual
the
life
span
of
communities
is
immensely
long
the
individual
is
at
his
or
her
best
for
a
few
years
or
decades
communities
and
their
institutions
endure
for
hundreds
and
in
some
cases
for
thousands
of
years
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
an
individual
can
hope
to
play
a
part
in
community
affairs
for
a
decade
or
two
before
he
comes
on
the
stage
of
public
affairs
and
after
he
leaves
it
social
life
stretches
indefinitely
politics
is
one
aspect
of
that
more
or
less
extensive
social
experience
its
immediate
objective
is
to
bring
order
out
of
chaos
and
replace
randomness
by
purpose
and
if
possible
by
plan
in
the
wake
of
the
bourgeois
revolution
which
was
directed
particularly
against
monarchy
and
generally
against
absolutism
the
most
obvious
and
attractive
social
pattern
was
a
republic
ruled
by
the
citizens
in
a
manner
which
in
their
opinion
was
best
calculated
to
promote
their
safety
and
happiness
under
a
republican
government
public
affairs
would
be
openly
and
freely
discussed
by
the
citizens
at
a
time
or
place
of
their
choice
by
word
of
mouth
through
a
free
press
or
in
public
gatherings
at
stated
intervals
elections
would
be
held
at
which
all
citizens
of
proper
age
would
select
representatives
and
a
legislature
or
parliament
where
questions
of
public
concern
could
be
debated
and
appropriate
measures
adopted
implementation
or
execution
of
these
measures
would
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
executive
officers
responsible
to
the
parliament
as
a
safeguard
against
any
miscarriage
of
the
public
will
the
right
of
petition
was
guaranteed
in
some
instances
the
right
of
referendum
and
recall
was
provided
to
obviate
any
miscarriage
of
justice
provision
was
made
for
courts
responsible
to
the
citizenry
as
an
independent
arm
of
government
competent
to
protect
and
assert
popular
rights
overall
citizens
of
the
republic
through
duly
elected
representatives
would
draw
up
and
proclaim
a
constitution
containing
a
general
plan
of
the
governmental
machinery
when
adopted
by
the
legislature
or
parliament
this
constitution
became
the
law
of
the
land
governmental
activities
were
carried
out
and
laws
were
enacted
in
conformity
with
constitutional
provisions
in
practice
the
citizens
of
the
freest
republic
were
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
oldest
political
dilemmas
confronting
mankind
the
question
of
leadership
and
followership
in
almost
any
social
situation
from
trivial
to
grave
and
critical
some
one
woman
or
man
volunteers
advice
and
often
initiates
action
if
no
one
approves
the
initiative
falls
flat
if
there
is
a
chorus
of
approval
the
crowd
follows
the
lead
of
its
spokesman
if
some
approve
while
others
disapprove
or
remain
silent
a
show
of
hands
is
in
order
if
there
are
real
differences
in
the
group
some
taking
one
side
some
another
side
with
no
chance
of
common
action
the
group
may
divide
into
several
factions
some
remaining
in
the
assemblage
others
departing
with
their
spokesmen
leading
the
way
in
such
confrontations
there
are
many
determining
factors
the
experience
and
wisdom
of
the
leadership
the
urgency
of
the
subject
under
discussion
the
depth
of
the
separation
between
opposing
factions
the
experience
of
the
citizenry
and
their
willingness
to
compromise
on
divisive
issues
the
willingness
of
the
factionalists
to
abide
by
a
majority
decision
experienced
leadership
which
has
enjoyed
a
period
of
public
approval
long
enough
to
build
up
not
only
a
group
of
devoted
followers
but
a
group
of
and
who
owe
their
positions
to
the
leader
can
assemble
a
bureaucratic
or
political
machine
adopt
measures
and
take
the
steps
necessary
to
keep
its
chosen
leader
in
a
life
job
with
the
possibility
of
naming
a
successor
republics
have
adopted
various
measures
to
prevent
the
establishment
of
a
dynasty
by
limiting
public
to
a
stated
number
of
years
by
providing
that
the
office
holder
may
not
succeed
himself
political
leaders
may
avoid
such
provisions
by
staying
in
the
background
having
their
closest
associates
elected
to
office
and
when
their
term
is
ended
secure
the
selection
of
other
associates
upon
whose
personal
fidelity
they
can
rely
all
such
measures
require
that
the
leader
keep
the
favor
of
a
considerable
number
of
his
constituents
to
avoid
this
often
difficult
or
disagreeable
task
the
leader
and
his
close
associates
may
persuade
their
constituency
to
both
constitution
and
parliament
enlist
the
support
of
the
military
seize
power
and
establish
an
arbitrary
dictatorship
of
admirals
and
generals
or
establish
a
committee
of
military
leaders
who
will
pick
out
civilian
office
holders
willing
to
follow
the
political
line
laid
down
by
the
military
leaders
as
republics
gain
in
wealth
increase
their
power
and
broaden
their
geographical
base
by
bringing
outside
peoples
under
their
sway
their
dependence
upon
military
means
of
resolving
public
controversies
becomes
greater
this
is
particularly
true
where
outsiders
brought
under
the
republic
authority
have
mature
political
institutions
including
their
own
leaders
and
their
own
ways
of
dealing
with
public
relations
given
such
a
situation
the
control
by
the
republic
over
the
apparatus
of
dependencies
is
likely
to
have
been
established
by
force
of
arms
in
such
a
case
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
and
occasion
when
the
dependency
will
demand
the
right
of
and
be
prepared
to
fight
for
independence
of
foreign
tyrants
oppressors
and
exploiters
minor
inexpensive
military
operations
for
the
suppression
of
colonial
revolt
which
are
quickly
and
successfully
ended
may
add
to
the
stature
of
leaders
but
major
operations
long
continued
expensive
and
inconclusive
will
undermine
the
prestige
and
weaken
the
position
of
the
most
firmly
seated
imperialist
the
boer
war
against
the
british
and
the
wars
waged
by
the
koreans
and
the
vietnamese
against
a
series
of
occupiers
and
exploiters
are
excellent
examples
of
the
operation
of
this
principle
as
empire
building
proceeds
under
its
inescapable
expansionist
drive
a
point
will
be
reached
at
which
the
overhead
costs
of
maintaining
the
empire
will
exceed
the
income
as
that
point
is
approached
in
one
after
another
of
the
empires
comprising
the
civilization
the
central
authority
will
be
successfully
challenged
by
the
dependent
colonial
periphery
ordinarily
such
challenges
will
coincide
with
the
wars
which
have
periodically
disrupted
every
civilization
known
to
history
when
such
a
coincidence
does
occur
as
it
did
in
western
civilization
from
to
the
bell
is
likely
to
toll
loudly
for
the
civilization
in
question
measures
usually
adopted
to
prevent
such
a
catastrophe
martial
law
military
dictatorship
monarchy
divine
authority
are
more
than
likely
to
heap
fuel
on
the
flames
of
rebellion
and
lead
into
a
social
revolution
an
unstructured
social
group
operating
under
the
competitive
principle
let
him
take
who
has
the
power
tends
to
develop
into
absolutism
at
any
stage
in
the
history
of
a
civilization
this
development
can
take
place
civilization
therefore
comes
into
being
with
this
contradiction
the
strong
and
predatory
exploit
the
weak
but
at
a
certain
point
protect
the
weak
and
nurture
the
defenseless
exploitation
by
the
rich
and
powerful
is
recognized
and
accepted
as
a
prerogative
enjoyed
by
the
rich
and
powerful
at
the
same
time
limitations
are
placed
on
the
character
and
intensity
of
the
exploitation
this
dichotomy
is
perpetuated
by
agreements
laws
and
constitutions
which
guarantee
the
property
rights
and
social
privileges
by
which
the
rich
and
powerful
safeguard
and
increase
their
wealth
and
power
under
the
same
agreements
laws
and
constitutions
the
privileges
and
rights
of
the
defenseless
and
weak
are
specified
political
institutions
in
every
civilization
including
that
of
the
west
have
accepted
and
adopted
a
regulatory
structure
under
which
limits
are
imposed
on
profiteering
the
domestic
life
of
a
civilization
consists
of
an
establishment
within
which
exploitation
can
continue
in
a
manner
which
the
constitution
makers
and
legislators
consider
to
be
as
efficient
as
possible
and
as
fair
as
possible
to
all
of
the
parties
concerned
as
a
civilization
matures
wealth
and
power
the
means
of
exploitation
are
increased
in
volume
and
concentrated
in
fewer
hands
the
resulting
absolutism
with
its
immense
structure
of
wealth
production
and
its
military
arm
imposes
conformity
to
its
decrees
servility
peonage
and
even
slavery
on
the
working
masses
the
masses
in
their
turn
organize
agitate
demonstrate
strike
sabotage
and
periodically
take
up
arms
in
defense
of
their
lives
and
their
livelihood
we
are
describing
certain
political
aspects
of
a
process
of
social
selection
which
has
dominated
one
civilization
after
another
at
the
present
moment
it
has
reached
a
critical
stage
in
the
west
we
apply
the
term
social
selection
to
the
result
of
this
process
because
there
is
a
parallel
between
the
natural
selection
of
the
biologists
and
the
social
selection
which
sociologists
observe
in
the
rapid
and
extensive
changes
presently
taking
place
in
the
centers
of
western
civilization
natural
selection
is
a
process
in
the
course
of
which
many
compete
and
contend
while
only
a
few
survive
and
mature
social
selection
is
a
similar
and
struggle
in
which
peoples
nations
empires
and
civilizations
take
part
many
enter
the
contest
but
only
a
few
live
to
write
their
story
in
the
long
and
complex
history
of
civilizations
at
the
outset
of
such
a
contest
the
cradle
of
the
coming
western
culture
contained
numerous
political
fragments
kingdoms
principalities
cities
city
states
inert
peasant
masses
migrating
tribes
struggling
locally
and
regionally
for
a
place
in
the
sun
or
for
additional
territory
and
extended
authority
these
struggles
reached
the
military
level
in
local
wars
regional
wars
general
wars
in
the
course
of
this
survival
struggle
the
weakest
and
least
effective
contestants
were
defeated
dismembered
and
gobbled
up
by
their
stronger
and
more
efficient
opponents
local
struggles
in
the
near
and
middle
east
in
north
africa
in
eastern
central
and
western
europe
were
trial
heats
in
the
course
of
which
many
contestants
were
eliminated
while
the
survivors
continued
the
process
of
city
nation
and
empire
building
at
higher
and
broader
levels
it
was
only
after
five
hundred
years
of
such
conflicts
that
the
outlines
of
western
civilization
took
definite
political
form
a
group
of
contestants
centered
in
europe
heavily
armed
and
equipped
intent
on
protecting
and
enlarging
their
home
territory
and
extending
their
authority
over
dependencies
and
colonies
in
various
parts
of
the
planet
this
survival
struggle
continued
for
another
three
hundred
years
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
reaching
its
highest
level
of
intensity
between
and
with
contestants
from
all
of
the
continents
taking
an
active
part
in
this
present
round
the
contestants
are
nations
and
empires
organized
in
alliances
some
of
the
contestants
are
old
scarred
and
battle
weary
others
are
young
and
vigorous
recent
entrants
in
the
contest
for
pelf
possessions
and
power
during
the
later
years
of
the
struggle
after
war
end
in
erstwhile
dependencies
and
colonies
of
the
disintegrating
european
empires
declared
their
independence
joined
the
united
nations
as
sovereign
states
and
played
active
parts
in
the
battle
for
survival
african
development
typifies
the
process
during
the
later
phases
of
western
civilization
when
voyaging
and
discovery
became
a
leading
activity
of
european
nations
around
northern
africa
was
directly
involved
but
the
bulk
of
the
continent
equatorial
africa
remained
almost
entirely
untouched
after
the
pattern
was
dramatically
altered
as
british
french
spanish
portuguese
german
and
italian
forces
moved
inland
staking
out
their
claims
division
of
africa
among
the
great
powers
reached
its
culmination
when
this
process
was
completed
about
when
the
whole
vast
continent
of
africa
excepting
ethiopia
egypt
and
south
africa
had
been
parcelled
out
among
the
rival
european
empires
in
terms
of
geography
and
population
africa
was
still
african
politically
it
was
occupied
dominated
and
exploited
by
european
empire
builders
who
used
the
over
all
trade
name
of
western
civilization
excessive
costs
of
empire
building
including
the
disastrous
losses
of
military
struggle
from
to
impoverished
and
weakened
the
european
overlords
to
such
an
extent
that
they
could
no
longer
maintain
their
footholds
in
africa
at
the
same
time
african
minorities
in
various
parts
of
the
continent
launched
independence
movements
under
the
slogan
of
drove
out
the
european
occupiers
organized
political
states
and
declared
that
africa
must
be
governed
by
and
for
africans
much
of
africa
at
the
time
was
organized
along
tribal
lines
which
cut
across
the
boundaries
drawn
by
the
european
imperialists
between
their
colonial
territories
the
resulting
chaos
temporarily
removed
africa
from
any
meaningful
role
in
the
contest
for
pelf
and
power
africans
are
politically
sovereign
economically
and
culturally
they
remain
dependent
on
their
former
european
masters
politically
western
civilization
is
in
a
state
of
flux
its
european
homeland
is
basically
divided
by
potent
fears
ambitions
feuds
and
conflicts
and
separated
geographically
from
north
america
and
asia
despite
several
attempts
to
unify
the
continent
politically
europe
was
disrupted
fragmented
and
weakened
by
two
general
wars
in
a
single
generation
the
european
empires
were
politically
and
economically
upset
by
widespread
colonial
revolt
in
asia
and
africa
spectacular
achievements
of
particularly
in
east
europe
and
asia
added
to
the
previous
fragmentation
a
new
line
of
division
between
capitalist
west
europe
and
socialist
east
europe
this
process
of
fragmentation
is
giving
separatist
forces
ascendancy
over
the
forces
of
integration
and
unification
in
roman
and
egyptian
civilizations
the
period
of
survival
conflict
led
to
the
centralization
of
wealth
and
authority
after
five
centuries
of
suicidal
competitive
struggle
the
european
homeland
of
western
civilization
is
by
sharp
lines
of
division
furthermore
the
shift
of
production
and
military
power
from
europe
to
north
america
and
asia
reduces
the
probability
of
speedy
european
integration
in
the
more
important
centers
of
western
civilization
the
chief
item
of
public
expenditure
is
preparation
for
a
war
of
air
water
and
land
machines
that
may
extend
technologically
into
a
nuclear
war
while
we
have
no
precedent
that
would
enable
us
to
gauge
the
consequences
of
an
extensive
nuclear
war
it
seems
reasonable
to
assume
that
it
would
further
fragment
an
already
fragmented
european
continent
the
heavy
burdens
of
militarism
which
western
civilization
is
presently
carrying
have
unbalanced
budgets
which
lead
to
inflation
and
to
onerous
burdens
of
debt
and
taxes
it
seems
unlikely
that
a
group
of
warfare
states
like
the
top
western
european
powers
can
escape
the
economic
contraction
which
presently
threatens
them
and
regain
solvency
and
stability
through
fiscal
reforms
or
readjustments
in
tariffs
and
trade
our
analysis
of
the
politics
of
civilization
may
be
summarized
in
four
general
statements
each
civilization
has
consisted
of
a
cluster
of
empires
nations
and
peoples
which
at
some
previous
period
have
enjoyed
independence
and
sovereignty
relations
between
these
erstwhile
sovereign
units
have
been
determined
by
a
shifting
mixture
of
diplomacy
and
armed
force
with
war
playing
a
determining
role
in
the
process
in
the
course
of
survival
struggle
political
leadership
within
the
civilization
has
shifted
back
and
forth
as
one
group
has
succeeded
in
establishing
and
maintaining
its
authority
over
the
entire
civilization
a
general
axiom
of
the
politics
of
civilization
might
read
at
the
conclusion
of
each
war
among
civilized
peoples
the
victors
are
entitled
to
make
the
following
declaration
we
operate
under
the
law
of
the
jungle
let
him
take
who
has
the
power
and
let
him
keep
who
can
we
have
the
power
we
have
grabbed
the
real
and
personal
property
of
our
neighbors
and
we
propose
to
keep
it
our
friends
are
welcome
to
attend
our
feast
of
victory
let
our
enemies
beware
chapter
seven
the
economics
of
civilization
politics
involves
the
exercise
of
authority
the
policy
making
planning
control
direction
and
administration
of
a
community
economic
forces
provide
the
wealth
income
and
livelihood
the
wherewithal
upon
which
a
community
depends
for
its
physical
existence
its
survival
its
geographical
extension
the
continuance
of
its
life
cycle
there
is
no
sharp
line
separating
economics
from
politics
while
the
two
fields
are
different
in
character
and
scope
they
are
so
interrelated
and
interwoven
that
any
successful
attempt
to
separate
them
would
leave
the
inquirer
with
two
segments
of
a
lifeless
social
cadaver
in
the
course
of
this
exposition
it
will
become
increasingly
evident
as
the
political
and
economic
lines
cross
and
that
the
two
fields
are
inseparable
parts
of
a
total
body
social
one
civilization
after
another
has
begun
with
a
predominantly
rural
economy
that
has
become
increasingly
urban
as
it
matured
food
gathering
pastoral
life
and
small
scale
agriculture
were
rural
trade
commerce
manufacturing
and
finance
concentrated
populations
increased
division
of
labor
specialization
and
interdependence
produced
the
trade
center
the
commercial
metropolis
and
the
general
purpose
city
herdsmen
and
land
workers
dependent
on
grass
and
rainfall
lived
close
to
the
subsistence
margin
and
were
at
the
mercy
of
forces
they
could
not
control
traders
and
money
changers
with
an
eye
for
business
in
a
growing
marketplace
made
a
more
ample
living
at
the
same
time
the
more
successful
among
them
accumulated
capital
which
they
loaned
or
invested
in
stocks
of
goods
shops
warehouses
caravans
ships
by
hiring
they
multiplied
their
own
limited
physical
capacities
by
investing
in
varied
enterprises
they
assured
themselves
against
possible
loss
in
any
one
of
them
they
also
multiplied
the
possibilities
of
profit
trade
finance
and
commerce
by
producing
a
regular
flow
of
abundant
income
brought
into
existence
a
new
field
of
occupations
and
a
new
class
business
and
the
businessmen
herdsmen
and
farmers
depended
for
their
livelihood
on
nature
her
niggardliness
or
generosity
the
businessmen
required
only
the
presence
of
a
group
large
enough
to
purchase
goods
and
services
pay
rent
and
interest
work
for
wages
and
leave
the
profits
to
the
enterpriser
each
profit
beyond
the
subsistence
level
enabled
the
businessmen
to
expand
buying
more
goods
hiring
more
labor
making
still
greater
profits
communities
of
businessmen
pooled
their
profits
extended
their
markets
built
fleets
enlarged
cities
through
joint
action
they
engaged
in
plundering
expeditions
and
collected
tribute
from
their
victims
organized
fabrication
turned
out
the
goods
and
services
which
were
marketed
for
profits
the
resulting
wealth
enabled
the
successful
businessmen
to
build
houses
stock
them
with
consumer
goods
and
art
treasures
hire
servants
live
sumptuously
productivity
wealth
prosperity
filled
their
honey
pot
to
overflowing
honey
pots
provide
the
good
things
of
life
for
their
owners
they
also
tempt
outsiders
owners
fear
pilfering
by
their
servants
fear
sponging
by
their
relatives
friends
neighbors
fear
robbers
and
kidnappers
fear
migrating
hordes
on
the
lookout
for
plunder
defense
is
a
necessary
aspect
of
each
rich
household
neighborhood
city
nation
empire
civilization
the
sequence
from
productivity
through
prosperity
wealth
accumulation
abundance
and
the
measures
needed
to
defend
and
safeguard
the
accumulations
leads
to
an
affluent
community
or
society
it
also
calls
into
being
new
and
distinctive
class
forces
i
the
business
class
hucksters
and
profiteers
a
aggressive
group
of
adventurers
promoters
and
organizers
of
bourgeois
society
to
whom
comes
first
at
one
or
another
stage
in
the
life
cycle
of
every
civilization
aggressive
bourgeois
greed
for
wealth
and
power
makes
itself
felt
their
role
in
western
civilization
has
been
outstanding
the
business
class
through
its
control
of
the
productive
apparatus
and
the
sources
of
credit
has
been
able
to
surround
itself
with
subordinates
scientists
and
other
experts
apologists
squads
police
and
military
spies
and
assassins
ii
a
middle
class
made
up
of
business
class
subordinates
plus
self
employed
tradesmen
professionals
independent
farmers
and
craftsmen
iii
a
class
of
blue
collared
and
white
collared
producers
of
goods
and
services
who
hold
their
jobs
during
good
behavior
when
not
needed
or
wanted
they
are
pushed
into
the
ranks
of
the
partially
or
wholly
unemployed
most
civilizations
have
added
to
the
working
force
serfs
peons
chattel
slaves
iv
a
class
of
hangers
on
economic
parasites
who
consume
more
than
they
produce
the
payment
of
unearned
income
to
property
holders
and
the
creation
of
monopolies
enables
this
class
to
live
on
rent
interest
and
profit
in
proportion
to
their
ownership
as
parasitism
increases
and
multiplies
it
proves
to
be
a
dead
weight
which
eventually
drags
down
any
economy
that
tolerates
it
a
class
of
dependents
defectives
and
delinquents
supported
by
society
but
contributing
little
or
nothing
to
its
maintenance
or
its
advancement
every
civilization
has
maintained
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
of
mobility
between
the
classes
mobility
makes
it
possible
for
those
with
greater
ability
and
energy
to
leave
the
countryside
settle
near
the
and
climb
the
ladder
of
success
it
has
also
made
it
possible
for
policy
makers
to
dump
those
whose
services
are
no
longer
needed
or
wanted
by
the
ruling
oligarchy
among
the
driving
economic
forces
in
a
civilization
are
hunger
fear
greed
ambition
in
practice
these
forces
have
proved
far
more
effective
than
whips
and
clubs
in
the
hand
of
slave
drivers
they
animate
the
for
pelf
power
success
which
attracts
idealism
energy
ability
and
throws
out
the
carcases
of
those
no
longer
able
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
oligarchy
and
its
establishment
hunters
herdsmen
cultivators
craftsmen
mariners
miners
perform
services
that
maintain
the
solvency
of
any
economy
in
which
they
play
a
leading
role
fast
talkers
adventurers
promoters
manipulators
gamblers
add
little
or
nothing
to
the
income
of
the
communities
in
which
they
operate
often
however
as
gargantuan
consumers
they
play
an
important
role
in
building
up
the
deficits
which
finally
wreck
an
economy
accumulations
of
wealth
in
market
centers
tempts
the
ambitious
and
the
adventurous
to
enter
the
and
grab
more
than
their
share
of
the
honey
the
most
obvious
way
to
do
this
is
to
secure
possession
of
the
honey
pot
far
away
in
the
tribal
past
of
a
civilization
lay
a
period
of
scarcity
in
which
the
members
of
the
community
shared
the
scarce
income
or
starved
as
the
tribal
wealth
increased
the
leaders
their
families
and
retainers
got
more
than
a
fair
share
of
the
available
goods
services
preferment
privileges
at
a
very
early
stage
the
ants
stored
away
what
they
could
spare
while
the
grasshoppers
had
a
good
time
investing
their
stored
wealth
in
land
or
productive
enterprises
the
ants
added
unearned
income
to
their
normal
earnings
from
productive
labor
because
the
ants
held
the
wealth
of
the
community
they
were
able
to
exercise
authority
and
determine
community
policy
one
result
of
their
decisions
was
the
creation
of
titles
to
land
and
stored
wealth
a
second
result
was
the
institution
of
and
later
of
under
which
those
who
owned
property
enjoyed
special
privileges
which
gave
them
still
larger
shares
of
the
community
wealth
and
income
wealth
ownership
and
the
exercise
of
authority
concentrated
in
one
person
or
family
created
a
basic
division
in
the
community
between
those
whose
livelihood
depended
on
their
labor
and
those
whose
income
was
determined
by
their
ownership
of
property
and
their
exercise
of
authority
in
the
course
of
time
this
development
divided
the
community
into
a
governing
minority
which
was
wealthy
and
a
majority
whose
livelihood
depended
upon
the
willingness
of
the
property
holding
minority
to
use
their
land
and
productive
implements
in
operations
that
turned
out
goods
and
services
property
ownership
and
income
were
protected
by
law
labor
income
depended
on
the
bargaining
power
of
the
majority
property
income
yielded
wealth
to
the
property
owners
labor
income
under
the
pressure
of
competition
in
the
labor
market
yielded
only
subsistence
thus
the
community
was
divided
into
owners
and
workers
the
owners
controlled
and
spent
or
invested
the
income
the
workers
were
provided
with
the
necessaries
and
a
few
crumbs
of
comfort
private
property
and
property
law
supported
by
state
power
institutionalized
a
basic
division
in
every
civilization
one
segment
of
a
civilized
community
enjoyed
wealth
and
power
other
segments
produced
goods
and
performed
services
the
owners
were
rich
the
producers
were
poor
riches
side
by
side
with
poverty
are
characteristic
features
of
a
civilized
society
exploitation
has
been
the
economic
backbone
of
every
civilization
from
earliest
times
to
the
present
day
each
civilization
has
exploited
and
used
up
its
natural
resources
in
every
civilization
individuals
groups
classes
and
sometimes
castes
have
exploited
or
used
up
fellow
humans
and
fellow
creatures
to
suit
their
own
purposes
and
advance
their
own
interests
abraham
lincoln
gave
a
classical
definition
of
human
exploitation
in
a
simple
sentence
it
is
the
principal
that
says
you
work
and
toil
and
earn
bread
and
i
will
eat
it
exploitation
of
nature
and
of
fellow
beings
by
man
began
long
before
written
history
during
periods
of
civilization
and
notably
in
civilization
exploitation
has
determined
social
relationships
it
has
also
become
one
of
the
pillars
of
every
civilized
community
civilized
peoples
use
up
natural
resources
as
a
matter
of
course
the
more
advanced
technically
have
stripped
their
environments
of
replaceable
and
irreplaceable
resources
they
have
also
perfected
techniques
for
using
the
productive
power
of
their
fellow
creatures
one
way
to
do
this
is
by
owning
the
body
another
way
is
ownership
of
land
capital
and
consumer
goods
which
enable
the
owner
to
live
without
labor
on
the
products
resulting
from
the
labor
of
others
owners
of
property
and
wealth
receive
an
income
because
they
are
owners
they
may
be
very
young
or
very
old
or
helpless
their
livelihood
comes
to
them
not
because
of
anything
they
do
but
because
of
the
property
titles
which
they
own
the
owner
of
land
may
collect
rent
the
owner
of
capital
may
collect
interest
the
owner
of
an
enterprise
may
collect
profits
each
lives
by
owning
workers
produce
goods
and
services
they
are
paid
an
income
proportioned
to
their
production
owners
of
land
capital
and
consumer
goods
are
paid
incomes
proportioned
to
their
ownership
workers
work
for
a
living
owners
live
by
ownership
chiefly
of
land
and
the
implements
of
production
owners
of
property
frequently
are
rich
workers
by
comparison
are
poor
the
line
separating
owners
from
workers
also
separates
riches
from
poverty
income
from
services
rendered
from
work
is
earned
income
income
from
property
ownership
by
contrast
is
unearned
income
the
relation
between
earned
and
unearned
income
is
not
confined
to
one
generation
under
laws
passed
by
the
owners
and
their
retainers
the
owners
of
private
property
may
give
or
bequeath
this
property
to
their
descendants
in
the
course
of
time
a
community
is
divided
between
workers
who
are
poor
and
owners
who
are
rich
since
the
rich
need
not
work
in
order
to
live
they
and
those
associated
with
them
may
live
on
the
unearned
income
derived
from
property
ownership
in
a
word
they
may
become
parasitic
parasitism
may
lead
to
social
decay
generation
after
generation
the
owners
and
their
dependants
may
live
in
comfort
or
even
in
luxury
while
those
who
work
and
their
dependents
may
lack
simple
necessities
this
is
the
confrontation
of
riches
and
poverty
which
has
played
so
large
a
role
in
every
civilization
through
the
ages
in
one
civilization
after
another
the
glaring
contrast
between
riches
and
poverty
has
appeared
dividing
the
community
and
laying
the
foundation
for
class
struggle
and
class
war
both
of
which
decrease
social
efficiency
intensify
class
antagonism
in
the
early
stages
of
any
culture
cycle
barter
is
replaced
by
a
money
economy
money
is
a
medium
of
exchange
usually
issued
by
a
public
authority
and
used
in
daily
transactions
to
pay
tribute
or
taxes
and
to
meet
other
general
expenses
in
its
earlier
forms
it
is
made
of
relatively
scarce
materials
that
are
in
general
demand
limited
in
supply
and
easily
divisible
into
smaller
units
gold
silver
and
other
metals
meet
these
requirements
and
have
been
used
as
money
through
the
ages
cash
money
and
promises
to
pay
speed
up
wholesale
and
retail
exchanges
in
the
market
place
they
fill
the
bill
in
normal
times
but
there
are
emergencies
and
other
exceptions
one
of
the
commonest
of
the
emergencies
is
war
in
a
previous
chapter
we
pointed
out
that
war
is
a
characteristic
feature
of
a
civilization
that
has
passed
the
of
its
expansion
and
begun
to
decline
then
the
chickens
come
home
to
roost
civil
war
colonial
wars
and
wars
between
imperial
rivals
follow
each
other
creating
emergencies
in
which
demand
for
certain
strategic
goods
and
services
rises
steeply
with
no
corresponding
increase
in
supply
prices
increase
the
common
defense
requires
immediate
purchase
of
supplies
the
public
treasury
is
exhausted
the
government
borrows
from
money
lenders
bankers
it
also
prints
paper
money
and
puts
it
in
circulation
if
the
credit
of
the
government
is
good
if
the
emergency
is
of
short
duration
matters
right
themselves
and
the
economy
survives
without
serious
derangements
but
disrupts
and
sometimes
destroys
an
economy
this
outcome
often
results
from
military
defeat
another
exception
to
normal
economic
transactions
is
buying
on
credit
buying
today
and
paying
tomorrow
the
temporary
gap
between
purchase
and
payment
is
filled
by
credit
a
promise
of
the
purchaser
to
pay
later
and
the
confidence
of
the
seller
that
the
bill
will
be
paid
such
credit
transactions
are
covered
by
notes
bonds
and
mortgages
made
out
by
the
buyer
and
accepted
by
the
seller
until
the
debt
is
settled
the
borrower
pays
the
seller
interest
at
an
agreed
rate
bankers
enter
the
picture
providing
capital
and
collecting
interest
on
their
loans
where
credit
is
abundant
and
relatively
cheap
borrowers
spend
beyond
their
incomes
hoping
to
pay
later
when
the
loan
falls
due
borrowing
and
are
among
human
frailties
they
are
also
forms
of
or
gambling
who
knows
whether
the
banker
who
promises
to
pay
on
demand
will
be
alive
and
doing
business
next
week
when
his
promise
to
pay
is
presented
for
settlement
when
the
promise
to
pay
is
issued
by
a
government
which
decides
the
value
of
currency
and
accepted
by
that
government
as
payment
for
taxes
and
other
obligations
it
is
more
readily
acceptable
than
paper
issued
and
guaranteed
by
an
individual
money
lender
or
banker
each
civilization
has
had
a
background
of
simple
use
economy
food
gathering
animal
husbandry
agriculture
in
which
most
of
the
people
produced
what
they
needed
and
consumed
what
they
produced
such
an
economy
employs
money
rarely
in
a
money
economy
those
who
have
cash
use
it
to
pay
their
bills
or
settle
their
accounts
those
who
buy
on
credit
pay
interest
to
money
lenders
the
money
lenders
later
the
bankers
make
their
profits
by
helping
others
to
spend
beyond
their
own
means
the
also
accepted
loans
from
others
promising
to
pay
them
back
at
a
later
date
and
giving
the
lender
a
piece
of
paper
specifying
the
amount
of
the
loan
the
paper
promise
to
pay
became
a
passed
from
hand
to
hand
it
had
no
intrinsic
value
but
as
the
money
lender
promised
to
pay
cash
for
the
note
on
demand
it
was
accepted
in
payment
of
debts
or
for
the
purchase
of
commodities
when
a
turns
out
a
product
and
exchanges
it
for
a
pair
of
shoes
made
by
a
shoemaker
there
are
no
overhead
costs
each
producer
adds
to
his
wardrobe
an
item
that
makes
his
life
more
satisfactory
examples
of
simple
barter
are
seldom
found
in
market
economies
civilized
society
assembles
quantities
and
varieties
of
goods
and
services
in
the
market
place
invites
consumers
to
choose
among
the
wares
and
provides
money
to
make
transactions
quick
and
easy
civilized
society
supplements
money
with
credit
on
the
principle
buy
and
use
today
pay
tomorrow
civilization
goes
beyond
these
bare
essentials
of
merchandizing
by
furnishing
transportation
and
communication
making
long
term
loans
at
interest
writing
insurance
developing
the
techniques
of
accounting
and
management
customers
who
visit
the
market
have
basic
human
needs
the
necessities
of
life
beyond
these
necessaries
there
are
conveniences
comforts
luxuries
the
markets
of
civilization
cover
the
entire
range
of
human
needs
and
human
wants
from
necessaries
to
luxuries
civilized
merchandizers
take
two
other
steps
aimed
to
activate
consumption
they
develop
new
lines
of

as
well
as

these
multiple
functions
of
a
civilized
economy
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
changes
which
have
converted
the
simple
barter
deal
of
exchanging
a
pair
of
shoes
for
a
shirt
into
a
specialized
civilized
market
place
they
also
cause
civilized
economies
to
devote
far
more
time
and
money
to
marketing
goods
and
services
than
they
spend
in
their
manufacture
in
a
broad
sense
these
supplementary
costs
are
overhead
shirt
makers
and
shoemakers
convert
raw
materials
and
partly
finished
goods
into
shirts
and
shoes
operating
costs
of
manufacture
are
minimal
in
a
civilized
economy
the
major
items
that
go
into
the
final
price
of
the
product
are
overhead
costs
current
accounting
practices
include
in
overhead
taxes
interest
insurance
and
general
items
actually
the
price
of
goods
and
services
in
a
civilized
economy
includes
minimal
charges
for
raw
materials
and
labor
and
maximum
charges
for
overhead
there
is
another
phase
of
overhead
which
pyramids
with
each
advance
in
the
extent
and
complexity
of
a
civilization
taxes
to
cover
the
costs
of

as
the
civilization
expands
and
specializes
governmental
services
multiply
the
number
of
government
workers
grows
in
proportion
and
often
out
of
proportion
to
the
total
production
costs
expenses
of
government
rise
and
with
them
the
corresponding
need
to
increase
taxes
overhead
costs
in
the
village
or
small
town
are
low
much
of
the
public
service
is
done
by
citizens
who
volunteer
their
time
and
energy
in
the
centers
of
civilization
public
service
is
a
profession
often
well
paid
and
usually
quite
permanent
expansion
is
a
basic
feature
in
the
life
of
every
civilization
expansion
increases
overhead
costs
when
american
indians
made
their
silent
way
through
the
forests
or
roamed
the
plains
there
was
no
overhead
each
provided
his
own
means
of
locomotion
with
roads
came
bridges
with
roads
and
bridges
came
capital
costs
as
dirt
roads
gave
way
to
macadam
and
macadam
to
asphalt
and
concrete
as
country
roads
winding
over
hill
and
through
dale
were
replaced
by
graded
superhighways
cut
straight
through
or
built
over
all
obstacles
the
cost
per
mile
rose
fantastically
all
of
these
added
costs
appeared
somewhere
in
the
tax
bills
which
citizens
were
required
to
pay
in
any
enterprise
overhead
costs
rise
in
direct
proportion
to
the
extent
and
complexity
of
the
social
order
as
they
rise
they
increase
the
prices
of
the
goods
and
services
which
citizens
or
consumers
must
pay
for
their
livelihood
a
good
illustration
of
this
principle
is
the
price
of
an
identical
acre
of
land
in
the
remote
countryside
on
an
improved
highway
in
the
suburbs
of
a
growing
city
and
at
the
city
center
increasing
wealth
brings
greater
risks
wealthy
cities
like
wealthy
individuals
and
families
must
pay
for
their
protection
against
robbery
and
piracy
against
extortion
and
expropriation
among
important
business
enterprises
insurance
ranks
high
the
costs
and
profits
of
insurance
are
suggested
by
elaborate
insurance
company
buildings
and
the
high
salaries
paid
to
their
officials
insurance
usually
a
private
overhead
comes
high
public
insurance
maintenance
of
law
and
order
crime
and
punishment
the
secret
and
open
police
the
armed
forces
land
and
sea
and
air
are
vastly
more
expensive
if
to
these
limited
costs
of
overhead
are
added
the
costs
of
militarism
as
a
public
enterprise
and
the
ruinous
costs
of
military
adventurism
and
its
inevitable
wars
the
mounting
costs
lead
to
insolvency
and
eventual
economic
and
social
ruin
another
overhead
cost
which
plays
havoc
with
civilized
nations
and
peoples
is
the
support
of
a
bureaucracy
increased
extent
and
complexity
exhaust
the
community
capacity
for
voluntary
service
and
lead
into
an
era
where
the
volunteers
who
carried
on
the
limited
public
activities
of
a
village
are
supplemented
and
eventually
replaced
by
a
constantly
growing
body
of
public
servants
growing
extent
and
complexity
plus
the
need
for
finding
safe
places
for
those
who
are
useful
to
the
rich
and
powerful
widens
and
deepens
the
public
crib
in
large
enterprises
private
as
well
as
public
paper
work
employs
a
small
army
which
must
be
fed
and
housed
at
a
level
worthy
of
a
great
nation
business
machines
reduce
the
personnel
necessary
for
a
given
social
enterprise
but
their
high
capital
and
operational
costs
increase
overhead
another
aspect
of
overhead
costs
is
the
multiplication
of
parasitic
professions
in
simple
villages
there
are
few
body
servants
no
individuals
who
fetch
and
carry
at
the
word
of
command
or
who
only
stand
and
wait
for
the
moment
when
some
whim
fancy
or
real
need
may
call
for
their
services
village
life
with
its
limited
area
and
still
more
limited
resources
has
little
economic
surplus
upon
which
parasitism
can
feed
there
is
landlordism
of
course
but
the
margin
of
surplus
is
small
the
city
the
province
the
nation
the
empire
present
a
different
picture
parasitic
professions
abound
and
proliferate
money
changers
money
lenders
realtors
confidence
men
gamblers
fortune
tellers
priests
entertainers
artists
thieves
robbers
and
prostitutes
abound
consume
more
than
their
share
of
the
community
income
without
making
an
equivalent
return
in
production
or
service
their
support
adds
to
the
social
overhead
another
source
of
social
overhead
are
the
numerous
followers
of
the
something
for
nothing
cult
who
receive
unearned
income
an
income
derived
from
civilization
in
its
mature
and
its
final
stages
broadly
there
are
two
types
of
income
earned
income
and
unearned
income
earned
income
is
something
for
something
or
return
for
goods
provided
or
service
rendered
unearned
income
is
something
for
nothing
an
income
derived
from
some
monopoly
privilege
sinecure
or
form
of
property
ownership
property
in
persons
or
things
has
been
a
characteristic
feature
of
all
civilizations
property
owners
receiving
rents
interest
dividends
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
property
which
they
own
are
not
called
upon
to
make
equivalent
return
in
exchange
for
their
property
based
income
this
personal
parasitism
of
property
owners
is
aggravated
by
provisions
of
property
law
under
which
the
owners
of
property
can
give
sell
or
bequeath
these
sources
of
unearned
income
to
family
members
friends
associates
eventually
unearned
income
handed
on
through
generations
creates
a
class
or
even
a
caste
of
citizens
who
live
without
rendering
an
equivalent
of
services
on
the
labor
of
their
fellows
adding
a
significant
amount
to
the
total
of
overhead
costs
wealth
ownership
the
exercise
of
power
living
in
luxury
on
unearned
income
add
to
overhead
costs
but
are
accepted
as
respectable
in
civilized
communities
another
and
far
less
respectable
form
of
social
parasitism
is
the
manipulation
of
social
forces
in
a
way
that
will
bring
the
operator
more
than
a
fair
share
of
social
income
with
no
equivalent
in
service
such
is
politics
or
politicising
politics
as
a
source
of
livelihood
takes
many
forms
some
less
legitimate
than
others
the
most
usual
source
of
is
the
humble
work
of
the
clerk
handyman
or
messenger
responsible
for
carrying
out
the
nagging
routine
of
government
beyond
this
common
labor
of
public
service
are
public
servants
skilled
in
their
several
professions
beyond
and
above
them
are
department
heads
and
still
higher
are
the
appointed
or
elected
officials
responsible
for
the
success
or
failure
of
a
given
public
policy
who
are
the
occupants
of
town
city
state
and
national
positions
of
authority
and
responsibility
preferably
they
are
elected
or
appointed
because
of
their
popularity
or
are
the
successful
product
of
civil
service
examinations
at
worst
they
are
appointed
as
a
return
for
favors
or
else
because
they
are
relatives
or
friends
of
successful
politicians
or
their
backers
whatever
its
source
and
however
efficient
or
inefficient
its
performance
the
body
of
paid
public
servants
increases
with
the
expanding
life
of
locality
region
province
state
nation
and
empire
with
its
growth
goes
corresponding
accommodations
in
wages
and
salaries
office
space
and
equipment
and
other
routine
outlays
frequently
the
increase
of
the
emoluments
of
bureaucrats
especially
at
the
higher
levels
of
authority
and
responsibility
creates
sinecures
which
are
filled
by
parasites
or
by
individuals
who
are
engaged
in
shoring
up
the
bureaucracy
rather
than
rendering
a
public
service
the
outlays
necessary
to
finance
such
a
bureaucratic
fabric
grow
in
direct
proportion
to
the
age
and
rigidity
of
the
bureaucracy
draining
off
public
funds
into
private
coffers
and
adding
uncompensated
elements
to
overhead
costs
if
inflation
is
a
problem
at
or
beyond
the
apex
of
an
imperial
epoch
or
cycle
of
civilization
financial
costs
rise
correspondingly
the
chief
overhead
cost
in
every
civilization
is
and
has
been
war
examine
the
budget
of
the
united
states
or
any
other
leading
civilized
power
from
to
of
central
government
outlays
are
for
war
in
the
past
and
preparation
for
war
in
the
future
the
net
result
of
rising
overhead
costs
appears
in
the
history
of
all
previous
civilizations
they
are
eating
out
the
vitals
of

while
we

and
read
these

chapter
eight
the
sociology
of
civilization
sociology
is
the
science
and
art
of
association
human
associations
range
from
kinship
groups
like
the
family
tribe
and
clan
to
larger
more
complex
groups
like
villages
towns
cities
nations
empires
to
still
more
inclusive
leagues
federations
and
civilizations
in
a
broad
view
sociology
includes
politics
economics
and
ideology
for
the
purposes
of
our
social
analysis
we
have
divided
the
field
into
four
separate
categories
beginning
with
politics
continuing
through
economics
and
drawing
our
study
together
under
the
general
headings
of
sociology
and
ideology
no
civilization
that
we
have
studied
can
be
regarded
as
an
intentional
or
projected
or
planned
enterprise
on
the
contrary
civilizations
have
developed
and
matured
in
true
pragmatic
fashion
taking
one
step
after
another
because
their
predecessors
had
followed
this
course
or
because
given
the
human
urges
and
the
available
natural
and
social
opportunities
the
next
step
seemed
to
be
determined
by
previous
steps
plus
the
momentum
of
the
enterprise
in
the
course
of
this
development
an
ideology
was
built
up
and
modified
in
such
a
way
as
to
justify
and
strengthen
the
entire
project
when
william
penn
received
a
grant
of
land
from
the
english
crown
he
was
already
committed
ideologically
by
the
quaker
faith
to
quaker
methods
without
ever
seeing
his
proposed
home
across
the
atlantic
he
drew
up
a
plan
for
his
city
of
brotherly
love
philadelphia
and
for
the
organization
and
conduct
of
his
enterprise
the
entire
project
was
formulated
in
penn
mind
and
put
on
paper
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
intentional
community
no
civilization
so
far
as
i
know
has
followed
such
a
sequence
certainly
in
the
civilizations
with
which
we
are
most
familiar
political
and
economic
forces
the
principles
of
necessity
and
availability
have
led
to
the
formulation
of
an
ideology
that
would
justify
and
promote
the
interests
of
the
social
group
which
was
controlling
and
directing
the
community
or
communities
in
which
the
civilization
was
maturing
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
each
of
the
component
elements
making
up
the
expanding
civilization
each
people
city
state
nation
empire
developed
its
own
total
culture
pattern
subject
to
the
pressures
mutually
exerted
by
neighboring
communities
the
aggregate
of
these
culture
patterns
separately
and
often
antagonistically
matured
comprised
a
lesser
totality
called
an
empire
and
a
larger
totality
called
a
civilization
it
is
with
this
larger
totality
that
we
are
concerned
we
propose
to
analyse
the
sociology
of
civilization
under
the
following
headings
the
structure
or
anatomy
the
function
physiology
or
process
motive
forces
in
civilization
contradictions
and
conflicts
with
a
final
section
on
the
life
cycle
of
civilization
the
structure
of
human
society
consists
of
specialized
economic
political
administrative
and
cultural
groupings
assembled
and
maintained
in
relationships
that
supply
necessities
conveniences
comforts
luxuries
for
the
individuals
together
with
capital
goods
and
services
for
the
social
groups
composing
the
civilization
in
terms
of
social
history
the
growth
of
structure
has
proceeded
from
the
horde
tribe
and
clan
to
the
family
village
city
nation
empire
civilization
these
steps
are
not
necessarily
sequential
under
varying
social
conditions
they
have
been
determined
and
modified
by
particular
historical
situations
the
smallest
and
most
intimate
building
block
of
human
society
has
been
the
family
the
largest
and
most
inclusive
has
been
the
civilization
the
family
as
a
social
group
has
existed
for
long
periods
over
wide
areas
in
immense
numbers
civilizations
have
been
few
and
often
far
between
they
have
arisen
out
of
particular
historical
situations
played
distinctive
roles
written
their
own
histories
and
made
varying
contributions
to
the
sum
total
of
human
culture
in
the
long
time
intervals
and
the
wide
geographical
distances
that
have
separated
civilizations
human
beings
have
lived
within
more
local
and
less
complex
social
structures
civilized
human
society
is
distinctive
in
structure
while
it
varies
in
detail
from
one
civilization
to
another
its
broad
outline
is
unmistakable
each
civilization
has
been
built
defended
and
perpetuated
in
and
around
cities
between
civilizations
in
time
and
space
most
human
communities
have
been
whether
as
food
gatherers
pastoral
people
or
cultivators
of
the
soil
they
have
produced
and
consumed
the
food
shelter
clothing
implements
and
weaponry
required
for
their
survival
the
city
whether
a
political
capital
or
a
center
of
trade
and
commerce
was
sharply
separated
from
the
countryside
the
city
by
its
very
nature
could
not
be
food
building
supplies
and
raw
materials
were
not
produced
inside
the
city
limits
but
must
be
produced
in
the
hinterland
from
which
they
were
transported
to
the
cities
city
dwellers
devised
means
of
paying
for
the
production
transportation
and
marketing
of
these
necessary
imports
the
countryside
can
and
does
exist
independently
of
the
city
because
it
can
provide
the
goods
and
services
on
which
its
existence
depends
the
city
on
the
contrary
can
not
exist
without
the
supplies
produced
in
the
hinterland
and
transported
to
the
city
urban
centers
of
civilization
have
for
their
background
a
pastoral
and
agricultural
source
of
food
supplemented
by
fabrication
merchandising
and
financing
instead
of
the
occupational
uniformity
of
the
countryside
the
city
offers
a
wide
range
of
occupations
increased
productivity
quick
and
substantial
profits
resulting
in
a
of
capital
on
one
side
and
enlarged
consumer
spending
on
the
other
consequently
the
successful
competitor
in
the
race
for
supremacy
develops
productivity
accumulates
wealth
expands
capital
spending
enlarges
the
scope
of
the
arts
thereby
augmenting
the
attractiveness
to
business
enterprise
and
migrants
from
the
hinterland
as
the
capital
city
grows
in
wealth
and
opportunity
it
requires
larger
imports
of
food
raw
materials
building

manpower
growing
internal
need
leads
to
greater
external
expansion
economic
political
administrative
and
cultural
needs
not
only
increase
the
demands
of
the
city
on
its
existing
hinterland
but
they
lead
to
a
demand
for
a
more
widely
extended
hinterland
the
countryside
is
the
goose
that
lays
the
golden
eggs
the
city
gathers
guards
and
eventually
consumes
the
eggs
or
converts
them
into
capital
forms
and
lives
in
part
on
this
unearned
income
the
city
is
the
mecca
which
attracts
by
its
wide
ranging
opportunities
it
is
also
the
center
in
which
policies
are
made
and
offered
to
the
countryside
as
normal
facts
of

the

a
number
of

competed
for

they
have
dropped
out

by
the

the

than

but
it
was
in
a
position
to

a

consists
of
a

bound
together
by

since
armed

together
the
agency
responsible

exercising
armed

enjoys
priority
in
a
listing
of
the
structural
institutions
of
civilization
land
owners
often
acting
as
military
chieftains
dominated
the
hinterland
of
a
civilization
the
city
was
dominated
by
businessmen
the
unification
of
city
and
hinterland
and
the
complex
of
cities
and
hinterlands
composing
a
civilization
established
a
governmental
apparatus
in
which
all
ruling
elements
were
represented
in
the
earlier
stages
of
a
civilization
there
may
have
been
assemblies
or
parliaments
composed
of
representatives
of
various
interests
as
the
civilization
was
unified
by
war
representation
was
replaced
by
some
form
of
monarchy
in
which
one
supreme
commander
emperor
or
pharoah
was
the
final
judge
and
arbiter
the
monarch
set
up
a
network
of
public
authority
regional
as
well
as
universal
provincial
as
well
as
central
and
garrisoned
it
with
professional
soldiers
and
sailors
paid
by
the
monarch
and
responsible
to
him
corresponding
with
this
political
structure
was
an
economic
structure
consisting
of
a
central
treasury
a
uniform
system
of
weights
measures
and
values
a
system
of
spending
priorities
decided
by
the
central
authority
a
source
of
income
taxes
tribute
booty
sufficient
to
cover
expenditures
a
civilization
which
ran
a
chronic
deficit
its
income
moved
year
by
year
through
debt
inflation
currency
degradation
and
repudiation
toward
its
own
disintegration
and
ultimate
bankruptcy
the
historical
record
is
very
clear
on
this
point
especially
in
roman
civilization
and
in
western
civilization
after
most
civilizations
have
had
a
body
of
religious
institutions
staffed
by
a
priestcraft
which
has
shared
power
with
the
economic
overlords
during
certain
periods
in
the
long
history
of
egyptian
civilization
the
priestcraft
held
the
balance
of
power
so
great
was
its
ascendancy
that
the
spoils
of
war
and
the
gains
of
peace
were
shared
by
the
temple
treasury
and
the
royal
treasury
in
some
cases
the
temple
treasuries
had
priority
all
civilizations
for
at
least
five
thousand
years
have
had
a
professional
military
of
sufficient
consequence
to
play
a
leading
role
in
policy
making
and
to
claim
a
lion
share
of
the
spoils
of
military
victory
in
some
cases
civil
and
military
authority
were
merged
in
one
supreme
commander
emperor
pharoah
at
other
times
notably
in
rome
after
the
fall
of
the
republic
the
pretorian
guard
nominated
and
appointed
its
emperors
well
up
toward
the
summit
of
each
known
civilization
four
groups
have
shared
authority
and
competed
for
supremacy
and
priests
where
these
four
major
shapers
of
public
policy
and
directors
of
public
administration
were
of
like
mind
they
shared
wealth
and
power
when
they
differed
one
or
another
enjoyed
priority
and
exercised
some
measure
of
control
over
the
other
three
less
personal
but
of
major
concern
among
the
institutions
of
civilization
were
the
channels
of
communication
and
transportation
that
have
played
so
decisive
a
role
in
the
life
of
every
civilization
top
ranking
among
the
means
of
communication
were
common
language
spoken
and
written
on
metal
papyrus
paper
a
unified
system
of
accounting
and
cost
keeping
permanent
records
among
the
means
of
transport
were
waterways
including
canals
viaducts
roads
bridges
skillfully
built
and
kept
in
good
repair
another
significant
institution
of
civilization
is
the
idea
of
ownership
the
division
of
property
into
public
property
and
private
property
and
the
right
of
the
private
property
owner
to
do
what
he
will
with
his
property
subject
always
to
the
principle
of
eminent
domain
the
right
of
the
community
to
expropriate
private
property
for
public
uses
with
or
without
compensation
another
institution
of
civilization
is
the
provision
of
public
services
in
addition
to
means
of
communication
and
transportation
these
public
services
include
a
water
supply
the
disposal
of
waste
public
defense
of
life
and
property
food
and
diversion
bread
and
circuses
for
the
needy
fire
prevention
and
fire
fighting
apparatus
educational
facilities
including
libraries
and
reading
rooms
outside
recreational
facilities
such
as
parks
and
all
of
these
facilities
could
be
provided
by
the
rich
and
powerful
for
themselves
and
members
of
their
families
they
could
be
supplied
more
effectively
and
apportioned
more
justly
when
they
were
public
services
open
to
all
the
countryside
lacks
the
financial
and
the
administrative
means
of
providing
a
wide
range
of
public
services
indeed
countryside
dwellers
pride
themselves
on
being
able
to
provide
necessary
services
on
a
family
household
or
village
basis
city
dwellers
learn
to
regard
such
public
services
as
a
matter
of
public
right
their
existence
is
a
magnet
which
draws
a
steady
stream
of
migrants
from
the
countryside
into
the
cities
civilizations
are
dominated
by
business
interests
it
is
for
them
to
provide
facilities
for
the
transaction
of

cash
money
credit
instruments
installment
buying
means
for
changing
money
insurance
discounting

as
a
civilization

in

and
population
the
political

becomes
a
major
employer
a
major
producer
of
goods
and
services
a
major

of

a

in

a
major
factor
in
the
multitudinous
activities
of
a
commercial
industrial
community
classes
class
interests
and
class
lines
are
a
part
and
parcel
of
all
civilizations
they
are
less
rigid
and
more
flexible
than
similar
lines
existing
in
an
agrarian
community
where
land
ownership
plays
so
large
a
role
in
determining
social
forms
and
social
functions
in
a
static
agrarian
community
dominated
by
landlords
and
the
clergy
rigid
class
lines
help
to
hold
the
community
together
in
a
community
dominated
by
business
interests
both
labor
power
and
purchasing
power
must
be
free
to
respond
to
demand
and
supply
this
is
as
true
in
a
planned
public
economy
as
it
is
in
a
private
enterprise
economy
in
accordance
with
the
same
principle
facilities
are
provided
for
the
movement
of
individuals
back
and
forth
across
class
lines
the
specialized
interdependent
structure
of
civilization
with
its
city
control
of
the
hinterland
its
products
and
inhabitants
enabled
the
oligarchy
to
accumulate
and
concentrate
wealth
and
monopolize

to
skim
the
cream
from
the

monopolize
the

distribute
the
skimmed

judiciously
and
thus
perpetuate
its
ascendancy
through
generations
and
centuries
during
periods
of
expansion
civilized
communities
develop
a
dynamism
which
maintains
their
ascendancy
in
subsequent
periods
of
contraction
form
takes
over
imposing
conformity
on
the
status
quo
during
their
periods
of
expansion
civilizations
are
dynamic
their
history
records
growth
at
home
expansion
abroad
exploitation
domestic
and
foreign
under
the
pressure
of
effective
motivating
forces
the
resulting
dynamism
leads
to
the
contradictions
confrontations
and
conflicts
which
have
studded
the
internal
and
external
life
story
of
every
civilization
perhaps
the
most
outstanding
aspect
of
the
dynamic
functioning
of
civilization
is
its
growth
in
magnitude
it
might
be
more
accurate
to
describe
the
process
as
an
explosive
expansion
explosive
because
rapid
and
spectacular
form
limits
function
at
the
same
time
function
modifies
and
ultimately
determines
form
the
two
factors
are
omnipresent
and
complementary
except
for
purposes
of
analysis
they
are
two
inseparable
aspects
of
every
human
society
where
form
predominates
social
status
results
where
function
predominates
fluidity
flexibility
and
dynamism
are
the
outcome
rapid
change
occurs
on
the
home
front
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
taking
place
abroad
growth
at
home
takes
place
in
two
fields
the
first
is
the
extension
of
the
homeland
frontiers
broadening
the
geographical
area
of
the
nucleus
around
which
the
civilization
is
being
built
the
second
aspect
of
growth
involves
an
increase
in
multiplicity
variety
and
complexity
and
perhaps
also
a
higher
level
of
quality
increase
in
quality
is
an
optional
feature
of
growth
and
expansion
toward
the
end
of
a
cycle
of
civilization
quality
declines
for
the
record
we
list
fourteen
aspects
of
the
domestic
growth
of
civilization
population
production
of
goods
and
services
trade
commerce
finance
wealth
capital
income
capital
construction
the
defense
establishment
growth
in
numbers

formal
education

advances
in
science
and

growth
in
the
arts
rising
standards
of
luxury
for
the
oligarchy
and
growth
in
the
volume
of
the
professional
and
technical
middle
class
and
their
living
standards
growth
of
the
state
bureaucratic
apparatus
in
its
complexity
and
in
the
number
of
its
personnel
growth
of
the
sources
of
unearned
income
and
especially
in
the
number
of
persons
living
on
unearned
income
growth
of
dependents
delinquents
criminals
and
other
outlaws
this
list
is
not
exhaustive
but
it
is
indicative
of
the
wide
area
in
which
domestic
growth
takes
place
paralleling
their
domestic
expansion
civilizations
expand
geographically
up
to
the
point
of
diminishing
returns
determined
by
the
growth
of
overhead
costs
this
process
has
taken
the
civilization
its
personnel
its
institutions
and
practices
into
territory
not
heretofore
occupied
sometimes
with
the
consent
of
the
foreigners
but
more
often
in
the
teeth
of
their
determined
and
opposition
expansion
of
a
civilization
is
of
necessity
a
movement
from
an
urban
center
and
beyond
the
urban
center
each
civilization
has
been
built
around
one
or
more
urban
nuclei
which
accepted
and
practiced
expansion
as
the
primary
law
of
their
beings
expansion
takes
many
forms
it
may
be
peaceful
as
travel
is
peaceful
it
may
be
competitive
as
trade
is
competitive
it
may
be
economically
aggressive
the
search
for
markets
for
raw
materials
for
investment
opportunities
carried
on
simultaneously
by
representatives
of
long
time
rival
cities
states
empires
it
may
be
a
movement
for
a
place
in
the
sun
mass
migration
colonization
it
may
take
the
form
of
planned
military
invasion
having
as
its
purpose
the
conquest

occupation
of

territory
the
subjugation
of
the
citizenry
of
the
conquered
lands
the
establishment
of
an
alien

in

the
reduction
of

as

instruments
historically
their

has

frankly
recognized
by

in

with

of

chapter
its
central
concept
is
the
you

in

it

it

the

on

axiom
unless
the

can
attain
those

and
serve
those

it
is
a
liability
not
an

and
its

will
pose
a
threat
to

venture
natural

self

is
of
secondary
consequence
coming
into

only
after
the

there
is
of

the
collective
principle
under
which
the

of

can
be
best
served
through
the
cooperation
of

but
this
is
a
horse
of
quite
another
color
it
presupposes
the
willingness
of
the
respective
parts
to
enter
voluntarily
into
a
cooperative
relationship
sociologically
speaking
this
is
the
antithesis
of
the
situation
we
have
been
considering
expansion
and
exploitation
in
the

and
for

of
the

forces
so
long
as
expansion

are
accepted

as
the
basic
principles
of
any

so
long

and
inimical
to
the
dominant

in
the

under
the

natural

the

this

with
no

or

if

where
must
it
go
the
oligarchy
decided
the
issue
in
terms
of
ostentation
and
expediency
rarely
during
recorded
human
history
have
there
been
oligarchs
who
said
irreplaceable

with
extreme
economy
replaceable

and
at

if
possible
augmented
decision
making
in
the
civilizations
reported
by
history
has
been
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
specially
privileged
minorities
the
purpose
of
these
minorities
has
revolved
around
the
provision
of
comforts
and
luxuries
for
the
decision
makers
and
their
dependents
and
the
increase
of
their
wealth
and
power
rarely
has
any
ruling
oligarchy
said
the
continuance
of

our

is
the
result
of

applied

we

and
vitality
of
those
who
do
the
world
work
if
due
to
unforeseen
circumstances
over
which
we
have
failed
to
exercise
adequate
control
there
is
some
shortage
let
the
idler
and
the
wastrel
suffer
under
all
circumstances
the
producers
must
have
all
those
goods
and
services
needed
to
preserve
their
productive
efficiency
through
the
entire
course
of
written
history
the
shrewdest
the
strongest
the
best
fed
and
most
comfortably
housed
have
gained
wealth
and
power
kept
them
and
added
to
them
this
has
been
the
central
sociological
principle
followed
by
the
oligarchs
of
one
civilization
after
another
nature
has
been
polluted
despoiled
pillaged
society
has
been
exploited
and
plundered
most
civilizations
during
most
of
their
history
have
been
led
and
ruled
by
the
rich
and
powerful
who
have
used
their
wealth
and
power
to
advance
their
own
interests
with
scant
respect
for
the
hewers
of
wood
the
drawers
of
water
and
the
tillers
of
the
soil
those
at
the
imperial
center
have
milked
the
periphery
cooperation
has
been
occasional
and
confined
largely
to
communities
in
all
civilizations
exploitation
has
been
the
rule
the
exploitation
of
nature
of
labor
power
and
of
the
social
fabric
the
record
of
natural
resources
exploitation
is
well
known
paul

the
fairfield
osborn
plundered
william
vogt
to
and
rachel
carson
tell
the
story
of
the
misuse
and
the
extravagant
abuse
of
nature
the
record
of
labor
power
exploitation
is
less
publicized
food
gatherers
like
the
north
american
indians
had
no
machinery
and
a
minimum
of
implements
or
weapons
they
migrated
with
the
weather
and
the
available
game
traveling
with
their
possessions
herdsmen
also
moved
about
in
search
of
pasture
land
workers
faced
four
new
problems
they
must
stay
with
their
land
and
make
a
habitat
in
dwellings
and
villages
they
must
make
the
implements
needed
for
farming
building
and
defense
against
marauders
they
must
accumulate
and
preserve
enough
food
to
carry
them
from
one
harvest
to
the
next
they
must
improve
and
beautify
their
artifacts
and
constructs
traders
added
a
fifth
must
they
must
produce
and
accumulate
stocks
to
meet
the
needs
of
various
customers
as
well
as
their
own
greed
for
profits
successive
stages
from
food
gathering
to
trading
and
manufacturing
required
more
energy
human
energy
animal
energy
and
eventually
mechanical
energy
part
of
this
energy
enabled
humans
to
survive
another
part
enabled
them
to
multiply
still
another
part
made
it
possible
for
one
portion
of
the
population
to
live
without
productive
work
on
the
work
output
of
their
fellow
creatures
this
exploiting
minority
was
headed
by
land
owners
soldiers
and
priests
landowners
built
themselves
and
their
dependents
strong
houses
and
castles
much
of
the
labor
power
that
went
into
this
construction
was
forced
the
laborer
gave
the
landlord
labor
time
in
exchange
for
the
privilege
of
working
part
of
the
land
for
his
own
support
soldiers
defended
the
landlord
and
joined
plundering
forays
on
the
territory
of
neighbors
the
priests
in
exchange
for
sustenance
mollified
higher
powers
and
built
temples
in
which
the
people
could
gather
worship
and
be
admonished
farsighted
energetic
resourceful
men
and
women
using
mass
productive
energy
built
themselves
castles
built
their
priests
temples
and
mobilized
serfs
war
captives
and
slaves
who
worked
in
gangs
for
generations
and
centuries
to
assemble
the
raw
materials
construct
and
decorate
the
buildings
and
perform
the
services
needed
to
operate
the
enterprises
and
to
provide
their
owners
and
masters
with
the
necessaries
comforts
luxuries
as
centers
of
civilization
grew
richer
and
more
powerful
they
defeated
neighboring
peoples
brought
some
of
them
home
as
war
captives
and
exacted
from
their
defeated
rivals
promises
to
pay
yearly
tribute
in
the
form
of
timber
metals
food
and
often
of
slaves
mobilization
of
energy
resources
had
been
proceeding
on
a
small
scale
for
ages
successful
civilizers
made
this
one
of
their
chief
tasks
mobilizing
energy
forces
and
materials
and
using
them
to
build
palaces
temples
mausoleums
and
whole
city
complexes
with
appropriate
defenses
against
marauders
and
other
enemies
administrative
networks
adequate
to
produce
such
results
planned
and
directed
the
construction
and
administered
and
policed
the
operations
using
elaborate
techniques
of
communication
transportation
fabrication
beautification
accounting

of
labor
power
imposition
and
sharing
of
authority
discipline
adjustment
to

means
for
dealing
with
revolt
and
rebellion
the
builders
of
civilization
performed
their
necessary
tasks
as
civilizations
have
matured
they
have
grown
at
the
nucleus
expanded
abroad
and
experimented
more
or
less
successfully
with
various
means
of
exploiting
nature
man
and
human
society
most
of
the
competitors
for
survival
and
supremacy
dropped
out
or
were
forced
out
in
the
course
of
continuous
survival
struggles
survivors
of
the
obstacle
race
dealt
successively
with
personal
rivalries
class
conflicts
civil
wars
dictatorships
tyrannies
with
overhead
costs
that
grew
more
rapidly
than
income
with
empty
treasuries
inflation
depression
economic
stagnation
with
increases
in

with
parasitism
with
hooliganism
with
the
growing

sharing
the
with
migrants
and
invaders
with
rivalry
and
power
struggle
at
home
and
abroad
with
division
fragmentation
and
eventual
dissolution
any
student
of
the
sociology
of
civilization
must
turn
from
this
analysis
of
function
with
the
conviction
that
whatever
the
advantages
of
civilization
as
opposed
to
earlier
phases
of
human
association
the
pattern
of
civilization
in
action
is
workable
only
to
a
very
limited
extent
civilization
is
not
an
example
of
perpetual
motion
rather
it
is
a
social
life
cycle
with
a
beginning
and
an
end
and
a
peck
of
troublesome
contradictions
and
conflicts
in
between
civilization
is
an
integrative
process
during
the
course
of
its
competitive
survival
struggle
potential
building
units
of
an
expanding
civilization
are
tested
out
and
included
or
rejected
in
much
the
same
way
that
a
checks
and
tests
the
individual
stones
of
which
his
wall
is
being
built
the
analogy
is
not
entirely
accurate
a
wall
becomes
a
completed
part
of
a
total
structure
a
civilization
is
a
process
of
existence
from
conception
and
birth
to
dissolution
and
death
at
any
point
in
the
process
there
is
a
delicate
balance
between
integration
and
disintegration
as
a
matter
of
fact
both
integration
and
disintegration
exist
and
act
constantly
side
by
side
if
the
integrative
forces
are
in
the
ascendant
form
is
built
and
function
is
accelerated
if
the
disintegrative
forces
are
dominant
form
breaks
down
and
function
stagnates
this
shifting
balance
imbalance
with
its
resulting
exists
geographically
biologically
sociologically
it
can
perhaps
be
best
described
as
successive
change
it
can
not
be
referred
to
as
evolution
except
in
its
integrative
aspect
disintegratively
it
becomes
devolution
civilization
is
a
result
of
sociological
at
a
certain
cultural
level
it
has
not
been
universal
in
all
human
societies
but
exceptional
both
in
time
and
in
geographical
space
what
has
caused
the
pattern
of
civilization
to
appear
disappear
and
reappear
again
and
again
during
the
period
of
written
history
there
have
been
many
answers
the
most
general
answer
is
divine
intervention
by
beings
above
and
beyond
mankind
whether
such
intervention
has
taken
place
or
is
taking
place
human
beings
are
unable
to
say
with
finality
but
several
thousand
years
of
recorded
history
plus
our
own
daily
experience
provides
convincing
proof
that
the
political
economic
ideological
and
sociological
constructs
which
have
appeared
and
disappeared
in
the
course
of
social
history
are
at
least
in
large
part
the
products
of
human
brains
and
human
hands
they
are
the
social
pattern
of
civilization
like
other
social
patterns
which
preceded
civilization
and
which
continue
to
exist
side
by
side
with
civilized
communities
is
the
result
of
human
ingenuity
and
human
energy
of
human
inertia
ineptitude
and
the
human
urges
to
build
decorate
and
destroy
variety
in
human
culture
is
caused
by
the
variety
in
the
human
natural
environment
the
human
social
environment
and
in
man
himself
natural
advantages
exist
and
vary
from
place
to
place
there
are
fertile
valleys
there
are
also
mountains
and
deserts
there
are
a
few
fine
harbors
but
for
the
most
part
landings
are
difficult
and
dangerous
certain
islands
have
become
the
bases
of
civilizations
but
this
is
true
of
only
a
very
small
number
of
many
existing
islands
civilizations
have
flourished
in
certain
climatic
zones
and
not
elsewhere
at
one
historical
period
civilizations
were
established
in
the
tropics
and
in
the
present
period
they
are
located
chiefly
in
temperate
climatic
belts
another
source
of
differences
between
civilizations
is
the
variation
and
the
adaptability
of
certain
peoples
to
the
peculiar
conditions
out
of
which
civilization
grows
still
another
explanation
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
civilization
in
particular
times
and
places
is
the
great
man
theory
of
history
all
human
communities
and
civilized
have
had
gifted
leaders
whose
thoughts
and
actions
have
brought
about
social
changes
these
greats
were
the
divinely
ideologically
or
sociologically
inspired
divine
inspiration
or
revelation
led
to
the
founding
of
religious
faiths
ideological
and
sociological
inspiration
resulted
in
domestic
cultural
changes
and
the
extension
of
economic
cultural
and
ideological
activities
into
foreign
lands
thus
pushing
the
frontiers
of
nations
empires
and
civilizations
farther
from
the
chief
centers
thomas
carlyle
wrote
that
history
is
the
lengthened
shadows
of
a
few
great
men
arnold
toynbee
concluded
from
his
of
that
religion
has

and

technology

of

in

and
perpetuating
civilizations
increased
productivity
expressing
itself
as
increases
in
income
accumulated
wealth
and
various
forms
of
capital

have
provided
the
economic

for

means
for

accounting

management
and
defense
among
the
social
motive
forces
responsible
for
the
development
of
civilization
is
the
accumulation
of
wealth
in
an
impoverished
world
the
most
important
single
factor
in
this
connection
was
the
development
of
a
class
of
businessmen
in
a
society
dominated
by
landlords
churchmen
and
soldiers
landlords
churchmen
and
soldiers
lived
during
periods
of
animal
husbandry
and
primitive
agriculture
on
the
very
narrow
margins
produced
during
bountiful
harvests
when
harvests
were
bad
husbandmen
and
farmers
were
reduced
to
starvation
levels
lacking
means
of
storage
and
refrigeration
as
well
as
facilities
for
transporting
heavy
materials
such
as
food
fuel
and
building
materials
society
accumulated
wealth
slowly
in
mobile
forms
precious
metals
and
jewels
and
made
few
productive
investments
the
advent
of
trade
business
and
the
trading
class
created
a
small
but
potentially
powerful
class
whose
income
and
wealth
were
not
derived
from
direct
contact
with
nature
but
came
from
trade
money
changing
lending
insuring
and
other
activities
associated
with
the
accumulation
and
investment
of
wealth
in
enterprises
only
in
a
secondary
sense
did
business
depend
on
animal
husbandry
or
agriculture
as
their
primary
task
businessmen
devoted
themselves
to
the
exploitation
of
labor
power
and
the
storage
and
merchandising
of
the
products
turned
out
by
herdsmen
farmers
craftsmen
part
of
their
profits
went
into
more
elaborate
standards
of
feeding
clothing
and
housing
themselves
and
their
dependents
another
and
a
more
crucial
part
of
their
profits
went
into
ships
warehouses
and
the
implements
used
in
converting
raw
materials
into
consumer
goods
and
services
transporting
them
to
the
markets
displaying
them
and
persuading
consumers
to
diversify
their
needs
purchase
a
greater
variety
of
goods
and
services
and
thus
increase
the
number
and
profitability
of
business
transactions
as
this
process
mushroomed
with
the
expansion
of
civilization
consumers
demanded
a
greater
number
of
more
expensive
artifacts
and
consumer
capital
goods
from
housing
and
house
furnishings
such
as
bathrooms
and
kitchens
to
refrigerators
washing
machines
air
conditioners
telephones
television
sets
bicycles
automobiles
and
elaborate
recreation
facilities
and
equipment
the
expansion
of
mass
production
and
the
mass
market
paced
one
another
constantly
raising
the
ante
mass
production
mass
marketing
and
pyramiding
profits
resulted
first
and
foremost
in
the
enrichment
of
businessmen
their
riches
automatically
pushed
them
into
a
position
of
importance
from
which
they
were
able
to
make
public
policy
and
utilize
public
authority
for
the
protection
and
advancement
of
their
own
class
interests
it
also
called
into
being
a
vast
array
of
new
professionals
teachers
engineers
scientists
technicians
social
workers
and
propagandists
converting
the
middle
class
from
a
shadowy
remnant
of
feudal
society
into
the
largest
class
numerically
and
the
most
influential
class
politically
in
the
entire
modern
community
at
the
same
time
economic
enrichment
and
expansion
increased
the
importance
of
the
apparatus
the
expansion
of
civilization
has
involved
a
competitive
struggle
carried
on
constantly
along
several
fronts
economic
political
cultural
ideological
the
means
of
struggle
in
every
civilization
has
included
the
military
as
a
political
force
and
as
a
final
arbiter
in
deciding
who
should
win
and
who
should
lose
civil
and
wars
victory
and
defeat
determined
the
fate
of
land
and
natural
resources
populations
capital
installations
taxing
facilities
domestic
policing
this
deterministic
role
of
the
war
machine
has
never
been
more
dramatically
in
the
foreground
than
during
the
crucial
years
from
to
the
present
day
when
war
apparatus
costs
have
topped
the
list
of
government
expenditures
growth
of
state
functions
with
the
expansion
of
the
economy
has
resulted
in
the
creation
of
a
vast
state
bureaucratic
apparatus
heading
this
bureaucracy
are
the
ministers
of
state
each
with
a
separate
department
under
the
department
heads
are
in
their
turn
into
bureaus
or
separate
offices
at
each
level
functions
are
assigned
and
salaries
are
fixed
entrance
into
this
anthill
is
sometimes
by
personal
favor
sometimes
by
examination
once
in
however
barring
misbehavior
or
some
catastrophe
like
the
abolition
of
a
particular
bureau
the
office
holder
is
in
for
life
with
a
pension
when
he
is
retired
for
age
inside
the
bureaucracy
there
is
a
slow
movement
determined
by
seniority
there
is
also
some
skipping
as
when
new
bureaus
are
formed
or
when
death
or
retirement
offer
opportunities
for
the
favored
few
to
move
forward
or
skip
upward
as
we
read
the
record
the
bureaucracy
existed
in
the
days
of
egypt
amenhotep
or
in
those
of
rome
augustus
caesar
as
it
exists
today
locally
in
every
municipality
province
nation
and
empire
and
generally
throughout
western
civilization
every
civilization
known
to
history
has
had
its
priestcraft
as
well
as
its
statecraft
statecraft
spawned
its
bureaucracy
priestcraft
spawned
its
theocracy
both
patterns
have
entire
civilizations
each
locality
region
and
district
has
had
its
representatives
of
state
and
of
church
in
some
instances
the
church
took
precedence
in
others
the
state
was
supreme
as
the
civilization
matured
using
war
as
the
chief
instrument
of
policy
the
state
in
the
person
of
military
dictators
has
tended
to
predominate
in
every
civilization
the
state
has
collected
its
taxes
and
the
church
has
collected
its
tithes
the
net
result
in
every
civilization
has
been
a
ruling
oligarchy
and
which
has
shaped
policy
planned
and
directed
administration
exercised
authority
and
lived
comfortably
and
at
least
on
the
backs
of
the
underlying
urban
and
rural
masses
sharing
its
sinecure
with
its
middle
class
handymen
in
some
times
and
in
certain
localities
the
oligarchy
has
maintained
a
representative
front
elsewhere
it
has
functioned
arbitrarily
in
extreme
cases
one
man
has
ruled
for
a
brief
period
generally
the
oligarchy
has
held
the
reins
of
authority
each
phase
of
human
society
has
had
its
oppositions
its
confrontations
its
conflicts
proportioned
to
its
magnitude
its
specialization
and
the
interdependence
of
its
component
parts
its
ratio
of
change
to
stability
and
its
foresight
plans
and
preparations
for
dealing
with
changes
when
they
occur
since
civilization
of
all
known
forms
of
human
association
is
the
largest
most
specialized
and
most
interdependent
it
is
in
civilization
that
we
should
expect
to
find
the
most
intensive
and
extensive
contradictions
confrontations
and
conflicts
among
the
many
oppositions
of
civilized
association
five
are
outstanding
the
relationship
rural
versus
urban
life
subsistence
versus
acquisition
and
accumulation
hard
work
versus
ease
luxury
and
parasitism
poverty
versus
wealth
civilization
is
not
only
complex
and
interdependent
in
form
it
is
avowedly
competitive
in
its
functioning
politically
nation
building
empire
building
and
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
each
civilization
is
a
competitive
struggle
between
declared
rivals
to
gain
and
keep
place
and
power
economically
the
efforts
to
get
and
keep
natural
resources
and

power
and
to
use
them
to
advantage

every

adopted

along

lines

the
traditional
confrontation
of
rural
urban
life
is
doubly
underlined
by
two
factors
first
the
countryside
operates
generally
on
a
use
economy
with
pay
for
services
largely
in
kind
or
by
barter
the
city
operates
under
a
market
economy
with
payment
for
services
usually
in
money
second
the
standards
of
life
and
work
are
more
primitive
in
the
countryside
than
in
the
city
third
as
the
civilization
advances
toward
maturity
city
population
increases
while
it
declines
in
the
countryside
consequently
vigorous
energetic
adventurous
people
leave
the
deteriorating
countryside
increasingly
the
owners
of
land
and
capital
live
in
the
cities
visiting
the
countryside
for
holidays
and
recreation
leaving
rural
areas
to
servants
peons
serfs
and
slaves
small
owning
farmers
are
bought
out
or
expropriated
unable
to
make
a
living
in
the
countryside
they
move
to
the
city
lacking
city
skills
they
work
as
casual
labor
or
are
unemployed
the
city
is
divided
between
enterprisers
their
subordinates
owners
of
country
estates
and
members
of
the
state
bureaucracy
on
one
side
and
vassals
servants
serfs
and
slaves
and
the
unemployed
on
the
other
the
rich
and
powerful
become
richer
and
more
powerful
the
poor
and
dependent
grow
in
numbers
protest

revolt
this
class
struggle
dominates
public
life
in
the
urban
centers
of
every
civilization
the
rich
offer
petty
reforms
and
minor
benefits
to
the
impoverished
city
masses
at
the

time
the

appeal

support
oppositions
and
confrontations
lead
to
conflicts
which
have
studded
the
life
of
every
civilization
conflicts
include
wars
which
may
be
divided
into
six
groups
wars
of
expansion
conquest
colonization
directed
toward
the
enlargement
of
the
territories
included
in
the
civilization
wars
of
survival
among
adjacent
nations
and
empires
wars
fought
to
suppress
unrest
and
revolt
in
the
colonies
and
dependencies
of
an
empire
or
civilization
wars
fought
to
repel
the
invasion
of
migrating
peoples
attempting
to
occupy
territory
over
which
an
empire
or
a
civilization
claims
jurisdiction
peasant
serf
and
slave
revolts
and
rebellions
against
the
authority
of

civil

to
determine
the

of

empires
wars
of

succession
conflicts
and
power
seizures
within
particular
oligarchies
in
every
civilization
final
decisions
regarding
domestic
and
foreign
issues
have
been
made
by
an
appeal
to
arms
there
were
laws
and
legal
institutions
in
many
civilizations
under
which
confrontations
might
have
been
prevented
and
armed
conflict
avoided
where
these
legal
means
failed
to
provide
solutions
contestants
turned
to
armed
force
as
the
final
arbiter
competitive
survival
struggle
has
played
a
prominent
role
in
the
life
of
every
civilization
known
to
history
competition
at
its
highest
level
employs
armed
force
as
its
instrument
of
policy
war
domestic
and
foreign
has
therefore
dominated
the
history
of
every
civilization
walter
bagehot
called
war
a
state

in
the
same
context
war
may
be
referred
to
as
a
civilization
maker
conflict
including
war
has
played
a
major
role
often
a
determining
role
in
building
and
maintaining
civilizations
it
has
also
been
a
major
and
perhaps
major
factor
in
undermining
and
destroying
civilizations
arnold
toynbee
contends
that
war
has
been
a
proximate
cause
of
the
overthrow
of
one
civilization
after
another
no
observer
of
current
western
civilization
can
fail
to
note
the
determining
part
played
by
war
during
the
first
half
of
the
present
century
every
completed
civilization
known
to
historians
has
passed
through
a
sociological
life
cycle
origin
growth
expansion
maturity
violent
premature
dismemberment
and
death
in
the
competitive
survival
struggle
or
gradual
decline
and
eventual
dissolution
every
completed
civilization
has
had
small
local
beginnings
on
an
island
like
crete
or
a
group
of
islands
like
the
japanese
archipelago
or
a
tiny
spot
like
latium
on
the
tiber
river
or
an
isolated
area
like
the
nile
river
valley
in
africa
the
seed
ground
or
nucleus
of
each
civilization
has
been
a
small
group
of
vigorous
energetic
people
living
in
an
easily
defended
limited
area
enjoying
relative
isolation
but
also
having
ready
access
to
the
outside
world
at
the
beginning
the
growth
cycle
has
moved
slowly
from
victory
to
victory
as
competing
neighboring
peoples
have
been
brought
under
the
authority
of
the
victor
in
local
wars
after
generations
or
centuries
of
struggle
a
point
is
reached
at
which
the
nucleus
of
the
growing
empire
begins
to
expand
through
trade
colonization
diplomatic
alliances
conquest
into
an
era
of
survival
struggle
in
which
rival
cities
reach
out
for
the
same
piece
of
fertile
land
the
same
markets
the
same
mineral
deposits
again
the

death
survival

tests
out
the
people
their
leaders
their
ambitions
determination

earlier
struggles
were
local
now
the
struggle
area
has
become
regional
at
the
outset
the
peoples
were
amateurs
in
the
science
and
art
of
expansion
occupation
consolidation
exploitation
through
the
hard
school
of
struggle
they
became
professionals
from
victory
to
victory
they
gained
in
territory
in
wealth
in
administrative
skill
one
by
one
rivals
were
eliminated
annexed
or
associated
with
the
nascent
empire
which
was
by
way
of
becoming
the
central
empire
of
a
maturing
civilization
generations
of
effort
and
centuries
of
time
have
gone
into
the
empire
building
process
the
farther
the
civilization
has
expanded
the
greater
the
necessary
input
of
manpower
wealth
enterprise
and
administrative
talent
needed
to
keep
the
enterprise
strong
solvent
masterful
eventually
the
expanding
civilization
reaches
a
point
at
which
the
costs
of
further
expansion
are
greater
than
the
income
derived
from
further
extension
of
its
authority
up
to
this
point
expansion
had
paid
its
own
way
beyond
this
point
it
is
a
losing
proposition
politically
economically
sociologically
at
this
point
begin
times
of
troubles
bad
harvests
colonial
or
provincial
revolts

between
individuals
or

of
its

which
have

beyond

lies
stalemate
economic
stagnation
military
defeat
building
an
empire
and
establishing
it
as
the
central
force
in
a
civilization
is
a
long
and
arduous
process
once
the
process
is
reversed
the
decline
may
move
quickly
or
slowly
but
as
it
proceeds
the
civilization
is
fragmented
and
eventually
dissolved
or
taken
over
by
a
more
vigorous
rival
at
all
stages
of
this

there
have
been

their

their
contribution
to
the
process
there
were
ups
and
downs
advances
and
withdrawals
victories
and
defeats
there
were
many
contenders
for
survival
and
supremacy
usually
there
was
one
survivor
which
gave
its
name
to
the
civilization
the
period
of
ascendancy
of
any
civilization
has
been
historically
brief
the
struggle
to
the
summit
was
long
and
exhausting
the
descent
from
the
summit
more
rapid
than
the
ascent
literally
like
the
bear
that
went
over
the
mountain
to
see
what
he
could
find
and
who
found
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
the
civilizations
that
have
reached
the
summit
of
wealth
and
power
have
found
on
the
other
side
of
the
summit
a
steep
downward
sloping
time
of
troubles
that
ended
in
dissolution
and
liquidation
civilization
as
a
sociological
life
pattern
has
proved
to
be
seductive
and
alluring
in
prospect
but
in
retrospect
unsatisfactory
and
frustrating
civilization
has
proved
to
be
not
an
opportunity
for
the
ambitious
but
a
trap
for
the
ignorant
inexperienced
and
unwary
for
the
many
contestants
who
set
out
to
conquer
the
world
the
experience
has
been
disappointing
and
on
the
whole
disastrous
for
the
few
who
have
reached
the
summit
the
experience
has
been
frustrating
civilization
as
a
way
of
life
is
like
any
other
contest
the
struggle
is
good
for
those
who
are
able
to
benefit
from
it
by
learning
its
lessons
whether
they
win
or
lose
is
a
matter
of
no
great
consequence
for
the
losers
the
experience
often
is
heart
breaking
and
students
of
social
history
have
been
tempted
to
draw
a
parallel
between
the
biological
life
cycle
of
an
individual
and
the
sociological
lifecycle
of
a
civilization
there
are
elements
of
likeness
between
biological
birth
growth
maturity
old
age
and
death
of
human
individuals
and
of
human
civilizations
all
of
the
individuals
and
civilizations
that
we
know
have
passed
or
are
passing
through
such
a
lifecycle
the
same
thing
may
be
true
of
the
larger
universe
of
which
we
are
a
minute
fragment
however
exact
or
inexact
it
may
prove
to
be
the
parallel
certainly
is
unmistakable
alluring
it
may
also
be
seductive

mortal
chapter
nine
ideologies
of
civilization
this
study
was
laid
out
along
inductive
lines
an
examination
of
the
facts
with
such
generalizations
as
the
facts
suggest
or
justify
we
began
our
social
analysis
of
civilization
by
presenting
noteworthy
facts
concerning
the
politics
economics
and
sociology
of
various
civilizations
in
the
present
chapter
we
deal
with
their
ideologies
we
are
accepting
and
following
the
fourth
variant
definition
of
ideology
presented
by
webster
new
world
dictionary
the
doctrines
opinions
or
way
of
thinking
of
an
individual
class
etc
in
this
case
we
are
reporting
on
the
doctrines
opinions
thought
forms
and
action
patterns
of
entire
civilizations
our
concern
is
not
with
the
doctrines
opinions
and
ways
of
thinking
and
acting
advanced
by
elite
minorities
such
an
approach
would
involve
a
study
of
comparative
ideologies
rather
we
are
asking
what
civilized
peoples
were
trying
to
do
as
measured
by
their
political
economic
and
sociological
activities
programs
and
purposes
it
may
be
presumptuous
for
an
individual
to
generalize
about
civilizations
of
which
he
knows
so
little
on
the
other
hand
if
we
recognize
the
limitations
under
which
all
assumptions
and
generalizations
operate
it
is
possible
and
often
helpful
to
assume
and
generalize
although
the
generalizations
may
be
no
more
than
interim
reports
subject
to
later
amendment
correction
or
rejection
what
were
the
prevailing
ideas
of
civilizations
and
what
ideas
were
put
into
practice
what
purposes
dominated
and
directed
the
lives
of
civilized
peoples
how
successful
have
civilized
peoples
been
in
achieving
their
objectives
at
the
outset
we
must
realize
that
in
any
complex
society
there
are
wide
ranges
of
ideology
from
the
body
of
ideas
held
by
small
uninfluential
sects
to
the
purposes
ideas
policy
declarations
and
actions
of
governing
oligarchies
we
do
not
wish
to
defend
or
attack
the
ideas
but
to
summarize
them
and
understand
them
in
a
way
that
will
give
a
group
picture
of
the
purposes
ideas
policies
and
activities
of
the
civilizations
in
question
for
convenience
in
our
discussion
we
will
take
up
first
civilized
societies
as
collectives
and
then
the
operation
of
civilized
ideology
as
expressed
in
the
lives
of
individuals
presumably
the
most
immediate
purpose
of
all
civilized
peoples
has
been
survival
getting
on
as
a
collective
or
group
from
day
to
day
through
summer
and
winter
under
normal
conditions
in
periods
of
stress
and
emergency
if
the
group
can
not
survive
it
loses
its
identity
breaking
up
into
the
parts
of
which
it
is
composed
survival
means
continued
existence
as
a
group
in
the
face
of
disruption
from
within
or
attack
and
invasion
from
without
the
group
which
survives
continues
to
exist
and
to
act
as
a
group
that
maintains
the
common
defense
and
promotes
the
general
welfare
each
social
group
competing
for
survival
has
a
sense
of
its
own
identity
and
a
belief
in
its
capacity
to
survive
this
ideology
is
strengthened
by
the
belief
that
the
group
has
special
qualities
and
is
protected
by
powerful
entities
that
will
guarantee
its
success
in
the
survival
struggle
the
group
considers
itself
better
qualified
to
survive
than
neighbor
groups
such
ideas
carried
to
their
logical
conclusion
make
the
group
in
question
superior
to
its
neighbors
in
survival
qualities
and
a
people
chosen
by
its
gods
a
superior
people
chosen
by
its
gods
is
in
a
class
by
itself
other
people
by
comparison
are
inferior
it
is
the
destiny
of
the
superior
people
to
take
the
lands
of
their
inferior
neighbors
and
whenever
opportunity
offers
to
defeat
the
neighbors
in
battle
capture
them
and
force
them
to
do
the
bidding
of
the
captors
cults
of
ideological
superiority
are
widespread
put
into
successful
practice
by
a
victorious
tribe
nation
or
empire
they
develop
into
cults
of
superiority
which
assert
we
the
victors
are
stronger
better
people
than
our
weaker
neighbors
as
one
victory
follows
another
the
belief
in
superiority

people
in
an
expanding

or

obviously
better

up

all

to
agree
and
to
which
they
must
adhere

new
members
enter
the

by
birth
or
adoption
they
are
duly
indoctrinated
with
the
group
ideology
early
in
their
history
the
individuals
and
composing
every
civilization
adopted
such
standards
and
promulgated
them
by
the
decree
of
a
leader
or
by
the
common
consent
of
associated
groups
as
the
outcome
of
negotiation
discussion
give
and
take
during
the
history
of
every
civilization
such

were
reached

in
compacts

specifying
the
nature
and
limits
of
the
collective
cultural
uniformity
at
which
the
community
aimed
the
struggle
for
collective
uniformity
was
long
and
often
bitter
individuals
and
factions
resented
and
resisted
the
imposition
of
group
authority
internal
conflict
led
to
civil
wars
in
the
course

which
the

was
reaffirmed
despite
hardships
imposed
on
disagreeing
divergent
minorities
closely
paralleling
the
group
need
for
survival
and
uniformity
solidarity
was
the
need
for
group
expansion
or
extension
in
the
competitive
struggle
for
survival
which
played
such
an
important
role
in
the
life
of
communities
strategic
geographic
location

often
decisive

such
geographical
advantages
are
few
and
far
between
often
they
are
already
occupied
and
defended
by
stable
communities
their
control
and
utilization
are
basic
in

the
survival

in
the
competitive

pressed
by
curiosity
and
the
spirit

the
imaginative
and
adventurous
members
of
each
generation
pressed
outward
from
the
homeland
toward
wider
horizons
many
traveled
some

others
pursued

of

plus
the
illusion
of

without

to

became
keys
to
survival

success
civilized

an
entire
region
like
the
nile

or
the
mediterranean
basin
had
been
conquered
and
occupied
by
a
single
great
power
the
measure
of
success
in
the
power
struggle
is
the
occupation
of
strategic
strong
points
natural
resources
including
land
and
labor
power
are
among
the
chief
spoils
of
victory
seven
basic
goals
or
principles
were
involved
in
the
building
of
civilizations
group
survival
propitiating
the
gods
recognizing
and

aesthetic
principles
achieving
and

expansion
bigness
individual
conformity
to
the
collective
pattern
and
collective
uniformity
in
a
united
world
of
human
brotherhood
at
times
and
in
places
the
basic
propositions
were
accepted
rejected
fought
over
each
civilization
which
followed
them
successfully
was
able
to
establish
itself
maintain
itself
and
up
to
a
certain
point
add
to
its
prestige
wealth
and
power
the
first
goal
was
success
in
the
struggle
for
survival
collective
uniformity
and
expansion
opened
the
path
to
wealth
and
power
in
the
city
state
the
empire
the
civilization
from
a
multitude
of
local
beginnings
the
struggle
for
expansion
and
consolidation
led
to
ever
larger
aggregations
of
land
population
capital
and
wealth
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
an
increasingly
rich
powerful
oligarchy
protected
and
defended
by
a
military
elite
pushing
itself
ceaselessly
toward
a
position
from
which
it
could
make
and
enforce
domestic
policy
and
order
a
second
collective
goal
has
been
propitiating
and
wooing
the
unseen
forces
of
the
universe
holding
their
attention
keeping
them
on
our
side
relying
on
their
influence
for
defense
against
enemies
mortal
and
immortal
and
help
in
providing
water
in
case
of
drought
fertility
assistance
in
healing
the
sick
comfort
for
the
dying
consolation
for
the
bereaved
and
success
in
business
deals
these
multiple
aspects
of
ideology
are
summed
up
under
the
term
religion
each
civilization
has
had
its
religious
ideas
and
ideals
its
religious
practices
and
institutions
many
civilizations
have
divided
their
attention
between
civil
ideology
and
religious
ideology
in
some
cases
religious
ideology
took
precedence
resulting
in
a
theocratic
society
under
the
leadership
of
religious
devotees
in
other
cases
notably
roman
civilization
and
western
civilization
religious
ideology
was
subordinated
to
secular
interests
in
the
early
stages
of
western
civilization
religious
ideology
took
precedence
over
secular
ideology
with
the
rise
of
the
bourgeoisie
secular
ideology
moved
into
the
foreground
making
loud
religious
professions
but
also
making
sure
that
had
the
last
word
in
the
determination
of
public
policy
a
third
collective
ideological
goal
of
civilization
has
been
aesthetic
the
yen
for
symmetry
and
balance
the
love
of
beauty
the
desire
for
harmony
the
quest
for
excellence
the
lure
of
magnificence
the
search
for
truth
out
of
these
urges
have
arisen
the
pictorial
and
plastic
arts
architecture
music
the
dance
science
and
philosophy
providing
outlets
occupations
and
professions
that
have
colored
and
shaped
many
aspects
of
civilized
living
a
fourth
collective
goal
of
civilization
has
been
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
social
structure
including
classes
caste
lines
based
partly
upon
tradition
partly
on
function
and
partly
upon
proximity
to
the
the
wellspring
of
wealth
income
prestige
and
power
since
the
principle
of
private
property
has
been
implicit
in
every
known
civilization
the
ownership
of
land
capital
and
consumer
goods
and
services
has
been
a
prerogative
of
the
ruling
oligarchies
shared
by
them
with
their
associates
and
dependents
and
used
as
their
chief
means
of
establishing
and
maintaining
the
you
work
i
eat
principal
of
economic
relationships
private
property
and
its
derivative
unearned
or
property
income
has
enabled
the
ruling
oligarchies
of
civilized
communities
to
receive
the
first
fruits
of
every
enterprise
they
have
also
enabled
the
oligarchs
to
establish
a
priority
scale
of
income
distribution
under
which
those
who
held
property
and
its
derivatives
could
have
first
choice
among
available
consumer
goods
and
services
second
choice
went
to
the
associates
retainers
and
defenders
of
the
oligarchs
third
choice
went
to
the
preferred
professional
experts
who
spoke
for
and
represented
the
oligarchy
fourth
choice
went
to
the
artisans
skilled
designers
builders
fabricators
what
remained
went
to
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
the
workers
women
and
men
who
provided
the
necessaries
comforts
luxuries
upon
which
physical
survival
and
social
status
depended
generally
this
proletarian
mass
including
chattel
slaves
serfs
tenant
farmers
and
war
captives
were
outside
the
pale
of
respectability
in
a
community
they
were
scavengers
and
untouchables
living
a
life
close
to
that
of
domestic
animals
most
civilizations
have
permitted
gifted
individuals
to
move
vertically
from
the
bottom
toward
the
top
levels
of
the
social
pyramid
vertical
movement
was
severely
restricted
however
generally
people
lived
served
and
died
on
the
class
or
caste
level
into
which
they
were
born
members
of
classes
and
castes
are
not
free
agents
they
have
privileges
and
rights
they
also
have
obligations
and
duties
classes
and
castes
are
functioning
parts
of
an
interdependent
social
whole
which
can
maintain
balanced
order
only
so
long
as
each
segment
recognizes
its
obligations
and
performs
its
duties
social
balance
therefore
depended
on
class
collaboration
successful
collaboration
in
its
turn
is
the
outcome
of
a
general
acceptance
of
class
and
caste
and
general
willingness
to
go
on
living
and
functioning
in
a
class
divided
society
a
fifth
collective
goal
of
civilization
has
been
expansion
from
the
nucleus
outward
with
final
authority
exercised
by
and
from
the
nucleus
at
the
outset
of
the
survival
struggle
which
led
to
the
establishment
of
one
language
one
religion
one
law
one
authority
one
loyalty
each
among
the
many
contestants
had
its
own
language
its
own
religion
its
own
law
its
own
authority
these
rival
forces
were
temporarily
confederated
against
internal
disruption
or
foreign
invasion
liberty
and
union
now
and
forever
one
and
inseparable
in
the
course
of
the
survival
struggle
the
separate
parts
of
which
the
civilization
was
composed
began
with
the
local
autonomy
permitted
by
confederation
and
ended
up
with
one
among
the
many
contestants
donning
the
imperial
purple
and
establishing
itself
as
the
master
and
supreme
dictator
the
caesar
or
pharoah
of
the
conquered
unified
world
foreign
territories
conquered
and
brought
by
force
of
arms
within
this
imperium
were
subjects
of
a
central
authority
which
they
never
really
accepted
authority
continued
to
be
exercised
from
the
imperial
nucleus
the
newly
conquered
territories
were
policed
by
professional
soldiers
whose
primary
loyalty
was
national
but
whose
responsibility
was
to
the
aggregate
composing
the
roman
or
the
egyptian
civilization
the
acid
test
of
the
expanding
civilization
was
embodied
in
the
degree
of
acceptance
of
wholeness
as
opposed
to
were
the
individual
members
the
provinces
and
colonies
composing
the
whole
willing
and
able
to
sink
their
differences
in
an
unquestioned
wholeness
or
were
they
prepared
at
the
first
opportunity
to
exercise
their
right
to
and
declare
their
independence
of
the
whole
the
resolution
of
this
question
constituted
the
sixth
collective
goal
of
civilization
to
establish
a
whole
in
which
the
component
members
were
able
and
willing
to
recognize
the
axiom
that
the
interests
of
the
whole
come
before
the
interests
of
any
of
its
component
parts
the
issue
of
central
authority
versus
local
self
determination
has
been
one
of
the
basic
issues
of
the
present
century
because
during
the
preceding
period
the
british
french
dutch
and
spanish
empires
had
been
built
up
by
the
conquest
and
occupation
of
foreign
lands
if
the
nineteenth
century
was
an
epoch
of
expanding
imperial
authority
the
twentieth
century
has
been
an
epoch
of
the
dismemberment
of
empires
by
movements
for
independence
and
seventh
and
finally
among
the
collective
goals
of
civilization
each
has
developed
an
ideology
that
justified
empire
building
by
conquest
exploitation
chattel
slavery
peonage
wagery
the
supremacy
of
the
empire
nucleus
the
subordination
of
the
periphery
to
the
nucleus
and
other
aspects
of
ascendancy
and
mastery
including
divine
rights
in
politics
and
natural
rights
in
economics
civilizations
expect
the
individuals
and
groups
of
which
they
are
composed
to
preserve
the
status
quo
work
as
disciplined
members
of
an
effective
team
and
be
satisfied
with
the
outcome
this
brings
us
back
to
the
goal
with
which
we
began
this
discussion
of
the
collective
goals
of
civilizations
the
primary
task
of
any
civilization
is
to
survive
each
individual
human
being
living
and
working
in
a
civilized
community
occupies
a
sphere
of
action
enjoys
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
accepts
the
responsibilities
and
duties
which
pertain
to
his
sphere
within
his
sphere
the
individual
succeeds
or
fails
in
so
far
as
he
leads
a
rewarding
personal
life
and
contributes
his
share
toward
the
collective
life
of
the
group
to
which
she
or
he
belongs
if
the
individual
in
a
civilized
community
is
to
live
a
good
life
the
first
task
is
to
maintain
normal
health
good
spirits
and
a
determination
to
get
the
most
out
of
life
and
to
contribute
at
least
the
equivalent
of
what
he
receives
in
service
to
his
group
as
a
civilization
expands
and
extends
its
influence
the
individual
must
contribute
his
mite
to
the
entire
enterprise
while
adding
to
his
own
store
of
goods
and
services
acquisition
and
accumulation
satisfy
a
human
desire
to
have
and
to
keep
they
also
add
to
the
wealth
and
well
being
of
the
community
on
the
widely
accepted
utilitarian
formula
happiness
comes
in
direct
proportion
to
the
extent
and
variety
of
ones
possessions
in
most
civilized
communities
the
building
unit
is
a
family
it
is
this
family
unit
usually
directed
by
a
male
or
father
figure
who
acts
for
the
family
and
represents
it
in
the
community
in
passing
the
reader
should
note
that
the
breakdown
in
family
life
now
so
prevalent
in
many
parts
of
western
civilization
is
a
departure
from
the
civilized
norm
it
is
really
a
measure
of
the
extent
to
which
western
civilization
itself
is
disintegrating
the
revolution
in
science
and
technology
mass
production
and
the
distribution
of
goods
and
services
through
a
mass
market
have
put
acquisition
and
accumulation
of
goods
and
services
as
a
to
a
severe
test
until
the
early
years
of
the
present
century
no
civilization
had
provided
affluence
for
more
than
a
small
fraction
of
its
population
the
vast
majority
consisted
of
slaves
serfs
war
captives
and
tenant
farmers
only
an
exceptional
few
were
in
a
position
to
live
in
comfort
or
luxury
on
unearned
income
as
each
civilization
matured
ownership
of
land
and
capital
diverted
the
flow
of
consumer
goods
and
services
into
the
coffers
of
a
diminishing
proportion
of
the
total
population
the
vast
majority
lived
at
or
below
the
subsistence
level
general
affluence
was
a
goal
that
was
talked
about
and
dreamed
about
but
there
was
no
way
to
test
its
practical
effects
on
the
population
as
a
whole
under
conditions
presently
existing
in
many
parts
of
the
west
millions
of
individuals
and
families
following
the
utilitarian
principles
of
acquisition
and
accumulation
have
secured
and
kept
an
abundance
of
goods
and
services
in
strict
accordance
with
utilitarian
principles
yet
they
have
not
been
and
are
not
happy
quite
the
contrary
in
many
cases
they
are
unhappy
particularly
in
the
second
and
third
generations
of
affluent
family
life
this
is
notably
true
in
the
united
states
scandinavia
switzerland
and
other
parts
of
western
europe
it
is
true
to
a
lesser
degree
in
new
zealand
and
australia
millions
of
families
in
these
countries
with
all
their
possessions
fail
to
enjoy
peace
and
happiness
on
the
contrary
they
are
so
acutely
unhappy
that
many
of
them
have
come
to
regard
acquisition
and
accumulation
as
a
sterile
consequently
multitudes
of
people
young
and
old
have
turned
their
backs
on
civilization
separating
themselves
from
their
affluent
homes
with
their
glut
of
consumer
goods
to
live
at
or
levels
these
individuals
are
avowedly
in
so
far
as
its
material
incentives
are
concerned
similar
attitudes
were
expressed
in
previous
civilizations
socrates
went
barefoot
through
the
streets
of
athens
diogenes
lived
in
a
tub
uncounted
numbers
of
indian
holy
men
and
early
christians
rejected
all
affluence
embraced
poverty
lived
simply
and
austerely
religious
asceticism
is
no
novelty
but
the
wholesale
rejection
of
acquisition
and
accumulation
as
a
way
of
life
certainly
marks
a
turning
point
in
the
popular
attitude
toward
the
utilitarian
axiom
that
human
happiness
is
directly
proportioned
to
the
quantity
and
variety
of
material
possessions
civilization
presupposes
getting
keeping
and
exercising
power
over
nature
society
and
man
each
civilization
has
added
to
utilization
of
nature
this
has
been
a
notorious
aspect
of
western
civilization
since
the
inauguration
of
the
revolution
after
a
century
of
intensified
exploitation
of
the
natural
environment
entire
communities
are
reacting
with
dismay
and
disgust
against
the
resulting
pollution
of
air
water
and
land
the
wanton
waste
of
soil
fertility
forests
and
minerals
and
extermination
of
various
forms
of
wilderness
freedom
to
exploit
nature
storehouse
has
not
brought
happiness
on
the
contrary
it
threatens
the
existence
of
other
life
forms
and
even
the
continuance
of
human
life
on
the
planet
private
enterprise
and
other
forms
of
permissiveness
have
led
to
practices
that
circumscribe
and
hamper
life
their
declared
objective
is
the
liberation
and
enlargement
of
human
life
and
well
being
where
they
have
been
tested
out
they
have
proved
themselves
to
be
obstructive
and
destructive
rather
than
creative
and
constructive
notable
advances
in
science
and
technology
have
greatly
increased
the
human
capacity
to
transform
nature
and
remake
society
designed
and
executed
as
a
means
of
enhancing
the
general
welfare
science
and
technology
might
have
promoted
human
but
employed
as
a
means
of
exploiting
nature
and
society
for
the
benefit
of
a
favored
few
science
and
technology
whether
directed
by
european
and
american
promoters
of
the
african
slave
trade
spanish
conquerors
in
latin
america
by
belgians
in
the

by

in
their
dealings
with
the
north
american
indians
by
the
nazis
in
europe
or
by
americans
in
south
east
asia
have
involved
merciless
exploitation
accompanied
by
revolting
atrocities
never
in
recorded
history
was
the
capacity
of
man
to
modify
nature
and
exploit
society
more
publicly
tested
out
than
in
the
atom
bombing
of
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
and
the
purposeful
devastation
of
jungle
life
and
village
life
in
large
parts
of
vietnam
and
cambodia
reported
in
the
public
press
and
pictured
live
over
radio
and
television
these
latest
developments
in
the
ugly
record
of
man
exploitation
of
nature
have
become
part
of
the
record
of
the
decline
and
dissolution
of
western
civilization
exploitation
of
human
society
for
the
benefit
of
the
few
at
the
expense
of
the
many
is
an
old
story
that
extends
through
the
entire
record
of
written
history
every
civilization
has
produced
a
cluster
of
institutions
and
practices
that
enabled
a
few
rich
and
privileged
to
live
in
affluence
at
the
expense
of
the
impoverished
many
this
juxtaposition
of
riches
and
poverty
is
the
logical
outcome
of
a
system
of
social
relations
designed
to
provide
the
few
with
comfort
and
luxury
while
the
many
are
forced
to
accept
penury
and
hardship
exploitation
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
permits
and
requires
a
parasitic
minority
to
live
in
abundance
while
the
majority
must
content
itself
with

have
played
a

reports
of

are
part
of
the

and
the
history
of
each

if
they
did
not
set

they

with
a
model
toward
which
their

if

their

were

each

has
adopted
lines
of

of

which
embody
the
best
and
most
advantageous
in

and
in
practice
these
codes
of

and
action
are
attributed
to
some
outstanding
individual
and
passed
on
from
generation

generation
as
codes
of

to
which
all

may
or
should
aspire
human

know
everything
about

whence
they
came
what
they
should

and
whither
they
will
go
to
compensate
for
this
lack
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
each
civilization
has
established
and
maintained
religious
organizations
and
institutions
whose
duty
it
was
to
search
out
the
truth
record
it
and
teach
it
to
successive
generations
in
some
civilizations
the
religious
institutions
have
dominated
the
secular
at
other
times
and
in
other
places
the
secular
has
maintained
its
ascendancy
over
the
religious
in
still
other
cases
the
religious
and
the
secular
forces
have
maintained
an
uneasy
balance
leading
to
acrimonious
bickering
and
sometimes
to
civil
war
central
to
their
discussions
is
the
nature
of
life
is
it
continuous
as
it
appears
in
vegetation
and
the
animal
kingdom
or
is
it
discontinuous
like
the
rocks
on
the

or
the
grains
of
sand
on
the
seashore
those
who
live
for
the
moment
prefer
discontinuity
those
who
observe
their
natural
environment
are
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
life
today
is
part
of
a
sequence
or
progression
which
relates
the
life
of
yesterday
to
that
of
tomorrow
recorded
history
from
fossil
and
geological
remains
to
the

shelves
assures
us
that
man
has
had
a
past
projecting
this
experience
it
seems
quite
reasonable
that
barring
accident
or
a
purposed
intervention
man
will
have
at
least
some
future
to
prepare
for
that
future
using
the
knowledge
and
wisdom
at
our
disposal
seems
to
be
a
must
for
any
reasoning
creature
even
for
the
short
planetary
of
the
average
human
the
logic
of
this
position
seems
inescapable
whether
it
applies
to
the
next
hour
day
year
or
century
in
terms
of
our
children
and
grandchildren
it
is
even
more
impressive
today
we
find
it
desirable
to
live
as
well
as
possible
if
there
is
any
future
the
same
principle
should
apply
to
its
implementation
and
utilization
if
the
hereafter
begins
tomorrow
and
if
those
whose
concerns
us
will
probably
be
alive
tomorrow
the
science
and

of
the

futurology
takes
its
place
beside
other
fields
of
theory
and
practice
as
a
must
for
all
responsible
members
of
the
human
race
if
the
conditions
presently
existing
in

society
affordment
skills
and
technical
experience
necessary
to
make
significant
changes
why
wait
why
not
proceed
forthwith
to
live
a
better
life
this
dilemma
has
confronted
individuals
and
in
various
civilizations
it
has
been
particularly
in
evidence
during
periods
of
decline
and
social
disintegration
it
has
led
people
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
to
uproot
themselves
from
the
old
social
order
and
reestablish
themselves
in
a
social
order
nearer
to
the
heart
desire
such
efforts
have
been
described
as
intentional
communities
to
distinguish
them
from
a
traditional
currently
existing
social
order
which
emerged
from
the
past
encumbered
with
vestigial
remains
and
obsolete
institutions

little
or
no

pilgrim

in

are
turning
their

on

are
organizing
enlarged

that
provide
their
members
with
a
modified
social
order
which
aims
at
improvements
here
and
now
necessarily
such
social
experiments
are
looked
upon
with
suspicion
by
the
establishment
they
are

subversive
godless
wicked
hence
they
are
criticized
denounced

often
broken
up
as

intentional

may
grow
out

they
may
begin
as

generally
however
they
consist
of
the

many
intentional
communes
spring
up
and
disappear
with
equal
rapidity
others
endure
for

in
a
very
real
sense
they
are
pilot

designed
to
correct
individual

social
maladjustments
and
substitute

ones
as

they

at

problems
of

as
we
consider

we
must
deal

with
the
way
in

about
one
fact
is
obvious
whether
social

is
major

local
or

it
shifts
the
social
balance
any
shift
in

some
of
whom
will
gain
while
others
will
lose
in
the
course
of

social
transformation
all
will
be
concerned
and
involved
since
political
change
involves
some
alteration
in
the
balance
of
social
forces
it
behooves
those
who
advocate
and
those
who
oppose
social
change
to
maximize
acceptance
and
minimize
opposition
in

to
take
advantage
of
the

incident

western
civilization
in
its
totality
faces
that
dilemma
the
culture
pattern
variously
known
as
european
western
or
modern
civilization
dating
from
the
crusades
has
existed
for
about
a
thousand
years
and
spread
across
the
planet
during
that
millennium
western
civilization
has
passed
through
a
life
cycle
similar
to
that
of
its
predecessors
according
to
oswald
spengler
historical
perspective
a
civilization
passes
through
its
life
cycle
in
about
a
thousand
years
if
the
spenglerian
assumption
is
in
line
with
the
course
of
history
western
civilization
should
be
in
an
advanced
stage
of
decline
and
should
eventually
disappear
as
a
decisive
factor
in
world
affairs
spengler
argument
is
fully
and
floridly
presented
in
decline
of
the
the
author
offers
a
theory
of
history
based
on
the
existence
of
an
arbitrary
and
rather
mechanical
life
cycle
it
includes
a
period
of
gestation
rise
and
expansion
a
period
of
maturity
and
stability
and
a
final
period
of
decline
and
dissolution
spengler
believed
that
western
civilization
is
in
the
grip
of
an
irreversable
decline
the
spenglerian
perspective
is
based
on
the
assumption
of
a
normal
pattern
in
the
growth
and
decline
of
civilizations
the
normalcy
on
which
spengler
based
his
assumption
was
disrupted
around
when
a
series
of
new
dynamic
factors
entered
the
stream
of
modern
social
history
mankind
gained
access
to
immense
stores
of
energy
which
supplemented
human
energy
the
energies
of
domesticated
animals
and
a
miniscule
use
of
water
power
and
air
power
to
these
traditional
energy
sources
the
revolution
in
science
and
technology
has
added
steam
electricity
and
the
energy
stored
in
the
atom
ii
these
new
sources
of
energy
were
harnessed
and
directed
through
mechanical
and
chemical
agencies
that
greatly
extended
human
capacity
to
convert
nature
stored
wealth
into
goods
and
services
available
for
human
consumption
and
to
develop
a
surplus
of
wealth
and
a
release
of
manpower
sufficient
to
build
up
a
backlog
of
capital
which
in
its
turn
produced
goods
and
services
with
economic
surpluses
convertible
into
additional
capital
iii
this
revolution
in
the
tempo
of
production
and
capital
accumulation
was
parallelled
by
a
like
revolution
in
transportation
and
communication
by
land
water
and
eventually
by
air
and
in
space
electricity
played
an
essential
part
in
the
process
by
speeding
communication
and
helping
to
put
transportation
on
wheels
iv
building
construction
was
also
revolutionized
metals
concrete
glass
and
synthetics
replaced
wood
and
stone
as
the
basic
construction
materials
new
energy
sources
and
the
new
capital
expanded
the
volume
and
variety
of
production
far
more
rapidly
than
the
increase
in
population
and
turned
the
resulting
surplus
into
a
technical
apparatus
that
made
possible
mass
production
for
a
mass
market
vi
mass
production
transportation
construction
and
marketing
ushered
in
an
era
of
surplus
that
replaced
the
age
of
comparative
scarcity
with
an
age
of
rapidly
increasing
abundance
changes
in
the
means
of
production
play
havoc
with
any
established
social
pattern
the
economic
alteration
that
accompanied
and
followed
the
eighteenth
and
early
nineteenth
century
transformation
of
western
economy
overturned
various
aspects
of
the
western
social
structure
representative
government
made
its
appearance
and
spread
widely
social
services
and

previously
reserved
for
the

of
the
modern
society
put
social
control
in
the
hands
of
a
new
ruling

class
the
bourgeois
revolution
brought
into
existence
two
other
classes
the
industrial
proletariat
as
an
ally
an
acceptable
leader
of
the
peasant
masses
of
europe
at
the

time
it
enlarged
the
middle
class
to
a
point
at
which
it
was
able
to
play
a
decisive
role
in
the
formulation
and
direction
of
social
policy
in
industrialized
communities
fragments
of
the
industrial
proletariat
and
the
greatly
enlarged
middle
class
came
together
in
an
avowedly
revolutionary
movement
which
reached
the
power
summit
between
and
the
bourgeoisie
countered
with
a
cold
war
aimed
to
exterminate
using
propaganda
petty
reform
and
armed
intervention
as
its
chief
agencies
the
high
birth
rate
the
prolongation
of
life
and
mass
education
provided
society
with
a
substantial
body
of
skilled
experienced
socially
conscious
alert
citizens
increasingly
aware
of
the
historical
changes
through
which
they
were
living
and
determined
to
intervene
whenever
their
was
threatened
extension
and
equalization
of

opened
the
way
for
an
informed
citizenry
to
express

emerging

spread
an
awareness
that

this
is
no

has
so
clearly
demonstrated
power

neither
anticipated

the

that

social

can
come
with

the
conscious
improvement

two

being
informed
of
the
potential
implicit
in

affluence
impatience
is
emotional
rather
than
rational
it
is
a
compound
of
human
urges
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
of
the
frustrations
built
up
in
individuals
and

frustrated
by

asian
and
american
countries
dedicated
like
the
soviet
union
to
the
task
of
building
socialism
in
addition
to
these
dozen
countries
several
others
such
as
india
burma
indonesia
ceylon
ghana
and
libya
declared
their
intention
of
building
socialism
by
legal
and
gradual
stages
almost
all
of
the
countries
busied
with
socialist
construction
were
in
east
europe
and
asia
the
countries
building
toward
socialism
were
more
widely
scattered
but
by
and
large
they
were
eurasian
from
to
socialist
construction
was
directed
at
least
in
theory
by
the
communist
international
with
headquarters
in
moscow
the
general
staff
of
the
world
revolution
under
war
pressure
the
communist
international
was
dissolved
in
no
equally
inclusive
international
socialist
authority
has
since
been
established
world
revolution
is
not
confined
to
the
old
world
of
africa
asia
europe
it
is
widely
prevalent
in
the
americas
where
it
can
claim
a
certain
priority
outstanding
among
colonial
uprisings
of
modern
times
was
the
rebellion
of
the
british
colonies
of
north
america
from
to
even
more
widespread
was
the
rebellion
of
the
spanish
portuguese
and
french
colonies
of
central
and
south
america
which
spanned
most
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
extended
on
into
the
twentieth
russian
bolsheviks
held
the
headlines
on
revolutionary
activity
from
to
but
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
one
of
the
most
prolonged
and
revolutions
of
the
present
century
gripped
mexico
from
to
at
the
beginning
of
this
period
mexico
was
a
political
of
the
united
states
it
was
with
a
large
population
of
amerindians
and
a
economy
foreign
capitalists
and
entrepreneurs
including
those
from
the
united
states
played
a
leading
role
in
the
country
mexico
revolution
was
prolonged
it
was
also
radical
many
aspects
of
its
old
social
pattern
speeding
up
the
bourgeois
revolution
and
preparing
the
way
for
a
mexican
form
of
populism
and
a
mexican
foretaste
of
a
proletarian
revolution
initiated
led
and
manned
by
mexicans
mexico
revolution
resulted
in
two
important
developments
that
have
played
a
major
role
in
socialist
construction
both
contributions
appeared
in
the
mexican
constitution
of
adopted
eight
months
before
the
russian
bolsheviks
seized
power
in
november
the
first
contribution
was
a
chapter
on
the
rights
of
labor
bourgeois
constitutions
had
emphasized
civil
rights
the
right
to
vote
trial
by
jury
freedom
of
speech
press
assembly
the
right
to
go
and
come
the
right
to
compensation
when
private
property
is
taken
for
public
purposes
the
right
to
modify
or
replace
the
existing
constitution
the
mexican
constitution
of
contained
a
detailed
specification
of
the
rights
of
labor
including
proper
working
conditions
adequate
compensation
education
health
social
security
the
constitution
also
contained
a
crucial
property
provision
the
natural
resources
of
mexico
are
the
property
of
the
mexican
people
and
can
not
be
alienated
this
second
provision
was
inserted
in
the
mexican
constitution
at
a
time
when
extensive
concessions
to
develop
mexican
resources
had
been
handed
out
to
north
american
and
european
capitalists
it
was
inserted
in
part
because
the
social
ownership
and
sharing
of
land
and
other
natural
resources
has
been
one
of
the
basic
demands
of
the
socialist
communist
anarchist
movements
from
their
inception
monopoly
capitalism
depends
primarily
on
the
private
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
including
natural
resources
capitalist
opposition
to
socialism
is
not
only
a
matter
of
theory
in
practice
the
private
ownership
of
natural
resources
enables
the
owner
to
charge
rent
to
any
and
all
users
natural
resources
are
sharply
limited
and
usually
localized
as
population
grows
demand
for
living
space
is
intensified
and
rents
rise
it
is
not
an
accident
that
the
stretches
of
black
earth
of
copper
iron
petroleum
the
precious
metals
and
the
land
occupied
by
mexico
city
london
new
york
and
other
population
centers
poured
a
stream
of
wealth
into
the
treasuries
and
augmented
the
power
of
their
owners
effects
of
the
insertion
into
the
mexican
constitution
of
the
provision
making
natural
resources
the
property
of
the
mexican
people
have
been
one
socialist
country
after
another
has
written
into
its
constitution
a
provision
that
its
natural
wealth
is
the
inalienable
heritage
of
its
people
this
provision
has
two
important
results
it
establishes
natural
resources
as
part
of
the
public
sector
of
the
national
economy
it
also
limits
the
possibility
of
handing
out
concessions
to
foreign
exploiters
private
or
public
during
the
opening
years
of
the
present
century
socialist
parties
and
other
forward
looking
organizations
were
demanding
social
ownership
of
natural
resources
public
utilities
and
other
social
means
of
production
as
the
next
logical
step
toward
a
more
equitable
distribution
of
wealth
and
income
there
was
a
possibility
that
such
revolutionary
changes
could
be
made
under
bourgeois
law
by
exercising
the
right
of
eminent
domain
upon
the
payment
of
reasonable
compensation
to
former
owners
at
least
in
theory
the
democratic
majority
in
any
bourgeois
country
could
put
an
end
to
private
enterprise
capitalism
and
establish
socialism
by
a
constitutional
amendment
legislative
enactment
and
a
caretaker
political
apparatus
to
administer
and
supervise
the
transition
socialist
parties
were
making
reformist
demands
for
better
working
and
living
conditions
and
revolutionary
demands
for
changes
in
property
and
class
relationships
increased
productivity
and
growing
affluence
made
it
possible
for
a
progressive
bourgeois
state
to
meet
the
reformist
demands
establishing
a
welfare
state
legally
and
constitutionally
under
the
bourgeois
constitutions
generally
existing
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
a
popular
majority
could
adopt
necessary
constitutional
amendments
pass
the
necessary
enabling
laws
and
launch
a
program
of
socialist
construction
such
a
program
was
part
of
the
thinking
of
european
and
other
socialist
leaders
during
the
opening
years
of
the
present
century
inspired
and
encouraged
by
the
successes
of
socialist
construction
in
the
soviet
union
and
other
socialist
countries
middle
of
the
road
socialists
proposed
to
move
gradually
and
legally
from
capitalism
to
socialism
conservative
socialists
who
were
members
of
coalition
governments
in
parts
of
eurasia
described
such
welfare
states
as
victories
for
socialism
despite
the
fact
that
they
left
the
essentials
of
state
power
in
bourgeois
hands
between
and
the
western
world
found
itself
in
this
essentially
revolutionary
situation
the
revolution
in
science
and
technology
had
opened
the
way
for
the
human
race
to
turn
its
back
on
the
limitations
and
inadequacies
of
civilization
and
advance
to
a
new
level
of
culture
and
human
opportunity
the
impact
of
this
revolutionary
situation
expressed
itself
at
several
levels
much
of
west
and
central
europe
important
parts
of
north

much
of

two
generations
of
experience
with
some
degree
of
affluence
scientifically
and
technologically
maturing
societies
that
had
opted
for
socialism
constitutionally
and
legally
were
engaged
officially
in

construction
these

were
kept
in

these
experiences
were
highlighted
in
british
guyana
and
cuba
british

as
a
consequence
of

the

forced
out

a

batista
had
emptied
the
cuban

before
he
fled
the

therefore
needed

to
meet
the
immediate
needs
of

he
also
sought
to
continue

under

the

castro
was
turned
down
cold
all

he
got
the

as

faced
by

they
bought

whether
by

by

this

in

to
implement
this

washington
used
a

in
the
three
decades
between
and
two
general
wars
a
plague
of
lesser
wars
a
general
economic
depression
and
a
hurricane
of
revolutions
scourged
the
planet
meanwhile
the
revolution
in
science
and
technology
and
its
products
penetrated
almost
every
crack
and
cranny
of
human
society
had
the
changes
incidental
to
these
rapid
transformations
been
carefully
planned
and
supervised
the
disturbances
in
the
ecology
and
the
shocks
to
human
society
would
have
been
less
disturbing
and
upsetting
in
the
absence
of
any
authority
there
could
be
neither
general
planning
nor
general
supervision
there
were
warnings
aplenty
from
liberals
and
radicals
who
were
attempting
to
keep
the
situation
in
perspective
but
such
utterances
failed
to
reach
the
great
bulk
of
mankind
disturbing
and
upsetting
products
of
the
revolution
in
science
and
technology
the
harnessing
of
steam
the
internal
combustion
engine
the
air
plane
electronics
plastics
and
the
release
of
atomic
energy
were
used
to
mutilate
destroy
and
kill
during
the
half
century
that
began
in
tens
of
millions

mobilized
fed

and
led
to
the
slaughter
fields
by
the
masters
of
western
civilization
in
two
long
orgies
of
wholesale
destruction
and
mass
murder
and
energies
and
techniques
that
might
have
brought
peace
and
plenty
to
the
human
family
were
used
to
set
fire
storms
that
incinerated
property
while
it
degraded
humanity
to
the
horrors
of
mass
suicide
in
a
very
real
sense
these
ghoulish
results
were
the
logical
outcome
of
competitive
nationalism
armed
and
equipped
with
the
technology
produced
during
the
two
centuries
of
the
great
revolution
war
is
the
most
carefully
planned
most
elaborate
and
most
intensive
form
of
competition
the
decisive
climax
of
a
life
and
death
struggle
for
survival
the
great
revolution
had
put
into
human
hands
almost
infinite
possibilities
for
utilizing
nature
and
improving
the
social
environment
with
foresight
careful
planning
and
skillful
manipulation
of
forces
and
trends
the
cultivatable
portions
of
the
planetary
land
mass
might
have
been
turned
into
a
garden
of
unending
plenty
dotted
with
marvelous
city
centers
of
light
and
learning
in
order
to
achieve
such
results
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
the
human
family
to
coordinate
its
efforts
around
an
agreed
division
of
labor
share
the
goods
and
services
produced
and
move
from
one
level
of
affluence
to
a
level
of
abundance
instead
of
joint
efforts
to
achieve
abundance
and
security
the
most
prosperous
and
most
highly
developed
centers
of
western
civilization
consolidated
their
authority
in
sovereign
states
surrounded
by
forbidding
frontiers
armed
them
with
the
most
destructive
agencies
that
human
imagination
and
ingenuity
could
devise
schooled
the
citizens
of
each
nation
in
the
suicidal
formula
might
makes
right
every
nation
for
itself
and
woe
betide
the
laggard
and
the
loser
the
logical
ideology
of
such
a
formula
was
egomania
suspicion
fear
and
hatred
its
outcome
was
a
competitive
life
and
death
struggle
for
wealth
and
power
with
the
nation
or
a
bloc
of
nations
as
the
units
of
competition
the
struggle
at
its
highest
level
involved
occasional
local
wars
and
periodical
general
wars
like
those
of
and
before
the
great
revolution
such
struggles
were
waged
chiefly
with
weapons
wielded
by
human
muscle
power
supplemented
with
whatever
animal
power
was
available
equipped
with
the
products
of
the
technological
revolution
the
struggle
became
a
war
of
machines
powered
by
the
energies
of
nature
retail
killing
and
destruction
was
replaced
by
mass
murder
and
wholesale
annihilation
given
the
assumptions
the
practices
and
the
institutions
of
civilization
the
catastrophic
losses
of
the
present
century
could
have
been
foretold
and
with
competent
leadership
and
disciplined
followership
could
have
been
averted
but
leadership
was
shortsighted
and
for
the
most
part
untrained
while
followership
was
split
up
into
national
and
local
segments
each
following
the
suicidal
doctrine
of
every
nation
for
itself
and
the
devil
take
the
laggards
around
the
earth
have
spent
a
wealth
of
time
and
energy
during
several
generations
predicting
the
present
revolutionary
upset
and
preparing
for
it
they
have
been
derided
denounced
and
persecuted
for
their
efforts
despite
bitter
opposition
they
have
prepared
for
change
they
accept
change
they
welcome
it
because
in
change
they
see
the
only
path
to
improvement
and
betterment
they
are
learning
to
live
with
change
and
even
to
welcome
it
because
the
time
of
troubles
through
which
their
society
is
passing
is
warning
them
of
the
dangers
they
face
at
the

time
they
are
learning
bit

of
the
spectacular
achievements
of
the

human

in

the
majority
of
mankind
has
been
unprepared
for

when
change
came
they
resented

since
their

is

they

western

each

each

is
an
expression
of

early
in

i
wrote
of

as
an

an

a

a

a

a
unity
of

a

a

of

these
terms
by

are
constructive
and
to
a
degree
creative
i
might
have
written
a
parallel
series
of
words
associated
with
destructiviness
in
every
social
situation
construction
and
destruction
are
siamese
twins
one
does
not
appear
without
the
other
the
same
forces
the
same
implements
the
same
institutions
and
practices
that
construct
can
be
used
to
destroy
through
ages
men
learned
how
to

make
a

start
pushing
up
and
tearing
or
wearing
down
is
implicit
in
nature
it
is
an
essential
aspect
of
human
society
each
human
being
is
a
living
example
of
production
and
destruction
each
generation
repeats
the
affirmation
modifying
it
little
or
much
in
accord
with
circumstances
modification
means
purposeful
change
partially
or
wholly
abandoning
the
old
and
replacing
it
with
something
new
in
the
course
of
these
changes
the
conservative
elements
in
man
and
in
society
voluntarily
or
under
coercion
give
up
the
old
and
learn
how
to
use
the

the

is
always
more
or
less
painful
especially
to
people
past
middle

the

from
a

of
affirmations
punctuated
and
interrupted
by
contradictions
and
conflicts
trends
inherent
in
the
revolution
of
suggest
a
cycle
that
reached
its
high
point
at
the
turn
of
the
century
and
began
its
downward
course
around
the
chief
european
empires

jointly
and
severally
involved
in
the
bitter
struggle
for
survival
and
supremacy
from
onward
until
the
outbreak
of

in
events
followed
an
irregular
course
marked
by
the
shifting
relationships
of
italy
and
the
increased
pressure
from
germany
for
a
showdown
the
showdown
was
the
war
of
continued
in
a
second
phase
from
to
immediate
political
results
of
the
showdown
were
victory
for
one
side
and
defeat
for
the
other
side
economic
sociological
and
ideological
consequences
were
profound
and
far
reaching
we
noted
some
of
them
in
the
previous
chapter
unesco
of
devotes
its
final
volume
six
to
the
twentieth
century
the
authors
note
that
the
chief
european
powers
emerged
from
the
general
war
of
weakened
in
every
way
in
men
and
wealth
in
the
balance
of
their
economies
and
the
stability
of
their
political
structure
and
above
all
in
their
relation
to
other
powers
rising
or
beginning
to
rise
in
other
parts
of
the
world
vol
vi
p
aside
from
the
relationship
which
led
to
political
realignments
during
the
years
the
essence
of
the
experience
is
to
be
found
in
the
unesco
phrase
weakened
in
every
way
another
way
of
describing
the
experience
is
to
state
that
the
participants
in
this
four
year
blood
bath
were
bled
white
it
is
easy
to
be
specific
in
the
course
of
the
war
sixty
million
people
were
mobilized
most
of
these
people
stopped
what
they
had
been
doing
until
of
and
began
an
entirely
new
line
of
activity
up
to
that
point
most
of
them
had
been
living
with
their
families
in
their
neighborhoods
going
through
a
daily
routine
that
included
household
cares
production
or
service
work
the
conduct
of
neighborhood
affairs
the
maintenance
of
normal
livelihood
activities
the
upbringing
of
the
new
generation
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
adaptation
to
a
rapidly
changing
social
situation
the
changes
that
took
place
in
the
summer
of
involved
an
almost
complete
reversal
of
purpose
and
direction
up
to
that
point
europeans
were
devoting
a
considerable
proportion
of
their
time
to
production
and
the
maintenance
of
the
normal
life
routine
at
that
point
they
left
their
homes
exchanged
ordinary
clothes
for
uniforms
laid
down
the
implements
of
peace
picked
up
the
weapons
of
war
and
prepared
under
very
expert
leadership
and
direction
a
series
of
mass
movements
designed
to
disrupt
the
ordinary
life
routine
of
other
human
beings
on
the
other
side
of
lines
drawn
on
a
map
but
having
little
relation
to
customary
life
activity
and
even
less
to
geography
execution
of
this
purpose
involved
a
mass
movement
from
the
home
territory
into
that
occupied
by
the
enemy
if
the
enemy
resisted
he
must
be
forced
to
do
the
will
of
the
invaders
instead
of
cooperating
in
a
joint
effort
to
maintain
and
improve
the
general
welfare
uniformed
armed
masses
began
beating
up
each
other
until
one
side
gave
in
and
cried
enough
plans
for
war
had
been
drawn
and
redrawn
for
years
for
decades
elaborate
preparations
had
been
made
destructive
weapons
had
been
designed
and
built
transport
had
been
provided
food
stored
defensive
preparations
had
also
been
made
in
the
form
of
fortifications
so
placed
as
to
obstruct
or
prevent
the
enemy
from
crossing
the
frontier
when
go
from
home
for
a
day
to
play
a
competition
in
another
city
or
province
they
go
play
the
game
and
then
go
back
home
to
continue
the
ordinary
life
routine
in
the
case
of
the
project
we
are
now
considering
they
left
home
in
july
and
returned
months
or
years
later
many
never
got
back
home
because
they
were
killed
in
battle
or
died
of
wounds
many
were
missing
they
disappeared
if
casualties
in
the
war
had
been
numbered
in
dozens
or
scores
or
even
in
hundreds
the
communities
from
which
they
came
could
have
gone
on
without
them
handicapped
perhaps
but
not
seriously
disrupted
but
when
they
were
numbered
in
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
it
was
a
quite
different
story
actually
they
were
numbered
in
millions
mobilized
to
carry
on
the
war
were
million
on
the
allied
side
on
the
side
of

with

all

provided
the

the

which
europe
great

assembled
to
take
part
in
this
profligate
orgy
of
mass
murder
which
went
on
for
more
than
four
years
from
july
until
november
body
count
reports
and
estimates
give
the
total
number
of
human

murdered
in
the
four
year
period
as
the
legal
definition
of
murder
is
killing
not
accidentally
but
with
the
intention
of
taking
life
this
figure
of
million
murdered
human
adults
most
of
them
in
the
prime
of
life
refers
to
the
murdered
bodies
that
were
recovered
and
disposed
of
in
addition
there
were
prisoners
and
missing
as
the
war
proceeded
it
became
less
a
series
of
combats
between
human
beings
more
and
more
it
was
a
war
of
machines
such
as
battleships
tanks
big
guns
and
by
war
end
of
airplanes
human
beings
drew
up
the
plans
made
the
blueprints
shifted
the
gears
pushed
the
buttons
their
efforts
were
supplemented
and
multiplied
by
the
killing
power
of
physics
chemistry
and
mechanics
brought
to
the
task
of
wholesale
murder
which
produced
million
dead
human
bodies
prisoners
and
missing
accounted
for
additional
human
beings
many
of
them
were
torn
to
shreds
and
smithereens
by
the
gigantic
concentration
of
mechanical
and
explosive
power
designed
constructed
and
transported
to
the
european
battlefields
for
the
express
purpose
of
carrying
on
this
and
collective
endeavor
to
take
as
much
life
as
possible
and
destroy
as
much
property
as
possible
while
war
declarations
authorized
and
legalized
mass
murder
and
wholesale
destruction
not
all
victims
of
the
hideous

casualties
numbered

among

million
among
the
boys
young
men
and
adults
mobilized
by
the
central

some
of
the
wounded
were
crippled
for
life
some
were
less
severely
injured
but
all
million
were
more
or
less
severely
handicapped
when
they
stood
up
to
face
the
rigors
of
civilian
life
at
war
end
all
were
denied
the
possibility
of
living
normal
productive
creative
satisfying
lives
wars
are
fought
on
battlefields
in
the
war
of
many
of
the
battlefields
included
villages
towns
cities
these
complex
institutions
occupied
by
men
women
and
children
were
smashed
and
burned
wholesale
the
figures
which
i
have
used
in
listing
the
war
losses
were
compiled
by
the
united
states
war
department
they
are
more
or
less
accurate
but
they
underline
the
fact
that
for
years
on
end
the
centers
of
western
civilization
concentrated
their
energies
and
devoted
every
means
at
their
disposal
to
cripple
or
destroy
fellow
human
beings
and
their
habitations
when
we
read
of
the
destruction
of
the
roman
empire
we
console
and
perhaps
try
to
fool
ourselves
by
saying
that
the
immense
network
of
civilization
which
the
romans
and
their
greek
associates
spread
across
eurasia
and
africa
during
the
historical
period
that
began
about
was
destroyed
by
hordes
of
migrating
barbarians
when
we
turn
to
our
own
civilization
however
there
are
no
barbarian
hordes
to
take
the
blame
the
wholesale
destruction
which
took
place
in
europe
from
to
and
which
was
repeated
and
multiplied
during
the
wars
of
was
carried
on
officially
by
spokesmen
for
the
most
advanced
most
highly
developed
most
civilized
countries
of
the
western
world
we
have
been
using
the
word
murder
to
describe
the
wholesale
slaughter
of
europeans
by
europeans
that
took
place
from
to
and
from
to
the
word
murder
is
inaccurate
the
europeans
who
carried
on
the
wholesale
destruction
and
mass
murder
during
the
two
most
general
wars
of
modern
times
were
committing
murder
in
one
sense
in
quite
another
sense
they

europeans
were
blotting
out
the
life
and
of
fellow
europeans
when
the
process
came
to
a
temporary
halt
in
every
european
participant
in
the
struggle
was
weaker
in
human
potential
and
poorer
in
economic
means
than
they
were
when
the

began
arnold
toynbee
describes
the
entire
episode
as
the
down
grading
of
europe
he
might
have
added
two
words
and
reported
the
down
grading
of
europe
by
europeans
as
a
glaring
example
of
large
scale
long
continued
deliberate
fundamental
social
changes
were
bound
to
follow
the
revolutionary
technical
transformations
that
took
place
during
the
revolution
of
changes
may
be
made
in
various
ways
some
are
slow
and
relatively
painless
particularly
when
they
extend
over
generations
other
changes
are
so
rapid
that
they
are
agonizingly
painful
involuntary
changes
made
under
outside
pressure
are
almost
always
painful
revolution
under
the
best
of
conditions
promises
to
be
painful
when
it
comes
from
alien
sources
and
is
under
forced
pressure
the
costs
are
almost
sure
to
be
excessively
high
this
brings
us
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
most
important
problems
facing
mankind
at
the
present
moment
given
the
worldwide
revolution
of
the
past
two
centuries
what
changes
political
economic
sociological
and
ideological
must
be
made
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
new
society
and
shift
the
family
from
the
old
homestead
to
the
new
apartment
with
a
minimum
of
pain
and
a
maximum
of
satisfaction

three

waging

groups
busily
preparing

occasionally
these
groups
joined

on
hot
issues
generally
they
were
far
apart
often
they
were
in
active
opposition
dedicated
peace
advocates
were
an
important
factor
in
this
period
they
had
been
vocal
and
influential
in
july
immediately
before
the
outbreak
of
the
first
general
war
they
had
continued
to
play
an
active
role
between
the
first

general

in
the
autumn
of
the
world
peace
council
called
together
a
peace
assembly
in
moscow
representing
significant
elements
from
countries
the
largest
single
element
in
the
world
peace
council
was
the
socialist
bloc
headed
by

peace
advocates
mobilized
wide
public
support
for
the
no

movement
that
developed
during
the
closing
months
of
the
war
for
the
treaty
of
which
renounced

as
an
instrument
of

for
the
effort
to
secure
general

that
resulted
in
the

for
the

charter
of
official
declarations
in

of

and

had
been
paralleled
by
the
organization
of
unofficial
peace
committees
and
societies
in
western
europe
in
the
americas
and
in
the

countries
peace
efforts
had
been
strengthened
by
the
outbreak
of

between

by

much
of

came
from

in

nationalist

movements
were
active
in

in

of
the

of

the

turned
more
and
more
from
general
advocacy
of
peace
such
as
the
stockholm
peace
petition
to
the
support
of
liberation
movements
among
colonials
and
supressed
minor
nationalities
preparations
for

were
expanded

was

the
most

note
sounded
for

voiced

vigorously
promulgated
by

in

spoke
of
our
goal
of
building
a

of

peace
in
the

at
the
same
moment
the
washington
administration
was
feeding
the
fires
of
war
in
south
east
asia
and
asking
the
united
states
congress
to
increase
defense
appropriations
from
billion
to

per
year
when
war
ended
in
there
was
a
sigh
of
relief
and
a
devout
hope
that
after
so
many
years
of
local
and
general
wars
the
time
had
come
for
western
man
to
take
a
long
decisive
step
in
the
direction
of

the

charter
expressed
this
hope
to
end
the
use
of

as
an
instrument
of

since
the
period
of

social
changes

had
been

the

implicit

escalated
the
rate
of
social

with
corresponding
modifications
in
the
pattern
of
european
political
economic
and
cultural
institutions
and
practices
in
the
early
stages
of

the
awareness

was
limited
to
a

to
the

change
was
a

a
great
social
gulf
separated
the
feudal

bourgeois

narrowed
and

bridged
the

differences
between

the
stark
contrast
between
city
abundance
of
goods
and

and
their
virtual
absence
from
the
common
life
of
the
countryside
grew
less
and
less
marked
as
the
proportion
of
the
total
population
living
in
the
countryside
declined
with
the
trek
to
cities
and
their
suburbs
europeans
living
for
the
most
part
in
a
rural
environment
passed
through
generations
of
illiterate
unawareness
of
the
social
process
through
which
european
life
was
expanding
the
rapid
extension
of
industry
and
commerce
after
the
bourgeois
revolution
completed
the
transformation
of
a
rural
west
and
central
europe
into
a
continent
of
town

devoting
their
lives
to
pursuits
unknown
to
their
immediate
forebears
in
this
new
europe
the
countryside
played
a
decreasing
role
as
food
supplies
and
raw
materials
came
increasingly
from
less
developed
parts
of
eastern
europe
or
from
the
colonies
which
were
opened
up
by
the
trade
and
commerce
promoted
by
the
aggressive
expansion
of
the
european
empires
most
europeans
satisfied
with
the
axiom
old
fashions
please
me
best
were
in
the
early
stages
of
this
transformation
as
the
conversion
of
europe
from
feudal
status
to
urban
dynamism
continued
however
an
ever
larger
part
of
the
population
became
aware
of
the
change
through
which
their
society
was
passing
with
the
renaissance
and
the
enlightenment
inert
unawareness
gave
place
to
enthusiastic
propaganda
in
the
writings
of
pamphleteers
essayists
poets
novelists
and
social
reformers
who
set
the
intellectual
tone
for
the
new
society
in
a
very
real
sense
the
bourgeois
europe
which
emerged
after
was
something
new
under
the
sun
large
elements
of
the
population
previously
engaged
in
producing
and
consuming
the
bare
necessaries
of
food
shelter
and
clothing
were
increasingly
engaged
in
trades
and
professions
and
rendering
services
unknown
to
the
feudal
countryside
as
the
expansion
of
western
civilization
continued
entire
european
nations
like
the
low

england

turned
to
trade

paralleled
by
corresponding
alterations
in
the

way
of

western
civilization
was
in
its
entirety
a
cultural
departure
from
the
pattern
of
any
preceding
experiment
with
civilization
because
of
the
drastic
changes
that
the
revolution
in
science

had
introduced
into
human
society
throughout
the
of
western
civilization
minor
and
major
alterations
have
been
made
in
its
structure
and
its
function
some
of
the
earlier
political
changes
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
bourgeois
revolution
they
included
the
abolition
of
absolute
monarchies
and
hereditary
aristocracies
and
their
replacement
by
limited
monarchies
and
republics
with
various
types
of
representative
and
popular
governments
selected
by
ballot
the
replacement
of
personal
tyrannies
and
autocracies
by
written
constitutions
and
laws
passed
by
elected
parliaments
replacement
of
war
as
the
sport
of
kings
and
the
chief
instrument
of
policy
makers
by
negotiation
diplomacy
and
treaties
which
became
the
core
of
existing
international
law
arbitrary
national
sovereignty
was
supplemented
by
more
or
less
permanent
alliances

by
the
formal
international
organizations
such
as
the
universal

were
held

efforts
were
made
to
establish
a
general
confederation
of
nations
and
empires
the
league
of
nations
in
and
the
united
nations
a
quarter
of
a
century
later
both
the
league
of
nations
and
the
united
nations
proved
to
be
feeble
and
ineffectual
efforts
to
bridge
the
gulf
between
limited
national
sovereignty
and
order
and
peace
but
they
were
tentative
steps
in
the
direction
of
a
federation
of
the
world
and
they
did
mark
a
notable
advance
from
the
chaos
and
conflict
incident
to
the
expansion
of
the
european
empires
toward
more
stable
economic
and
social
conditions
and
more
orderly
international
relationships
paralleling
these
changes
in
the
political
life
of
western
civilization
there
have
been
a
number
of
drastic
economic
reforms
one
was
the
abolition
of
chattel
slavery
a
second
was
the
replacement
of
serfdom
and
peonage
by
free
labor
receiving
fixed
wages
and
salaries
a
third
change
was
the
division
of
large
feudal
estates
and
other
concentrated
landed
properties
into
small
units
owned
and
operated
by
working
farmers
a
fourth
change
was
the
establishment
of
free
trade
areas
within
and
among
sovereign
states
a
fifth
innovation
was
the
transfer
of
individually
operated
and
family
businesses
into
associations
and
corporations
with
limited
liability
and
widespread
ownership
by
bond
and

other
natural

ninth
repeated
governmental
efforts
were
made
to
deal
with
the
inflation
that

prolonged
exhausting
wars
these
efforts
included
the
regulation

debt
and
the
substitution

that
had
been
hopelessly
devalued
political

economic
reforms
were

are

described
as
the

cultural

underlying
the
changes
and
supplementing
reforms
were
improvements
in
the
means
of
communication
and
transportation
the
discovery
and
use
of
new
sources
of
energy
and
the
changes
in
production
and
merchandizing
which
have
played
so
vital
a
role
in
the
transition
from
a
skimpy
economy

an
economy

the
colonizing
empires
of

in

this
has
been
true
of
the
millennium
that
began
with

crusades
and
has
hastened
the
rise
of

its
extension

proportions
similar

more
of
civilizations
that

sank
into
inconsequence
during

five
thousand

each
civilization
has
had
its
own
habitat
its
own

pattern
each
has
had
its
own
languages

traditions
and
customs
but
despite
such
local
differences
all
of
the
civilizations
have
had
in
common
those
characteristics
which
justify
their
inclusion
in
the
family
of
civilizations
anyone
who
wishes
to
test
the
accuracy
of
these
generalizations
may
be
satisfied
by
reading
and
observing
the
events
that
began
with
the
wars
between
japan
china
and
russia
the
spanish
american
war
the
boer
war
and
the
revolts
in

china
and

all
of
which
took
place
between

the

century
opened
in
a
period
of
critical
struggle
between
empires
within
empires
and
between
imperial
centers
and
colonial
dependencies
these
preliminary
skirmishes
led
up
to
two

by

the
contention

the

of
western

as
of

predecessors
is
a
competitive

its
contribution
retaining
its
essential
form
while
modifying
its
practices
to
meet
the
requirements
of
particular
situations
western
civilization
is
no
exception
to
this
general
rule
following
the
all
but
universal
principle
that
action
and
reaction
tend
to
be
equal
and
opposite
subjugated
occupied
peoples
revolt
against
foreign
occupation
and
exploitation
again
western
civilization
is
no
exception
as
the
movements
for
independence
and
that
followed
the
collapse
of
the
european
empires
clearly
showed
reaction
against
western
civilization
went
beyond
revolt
to
include
the
rejection
of
the
obsolete
concepts
forms
and
practices
inherent
in
civilization
rejection
has
been
accompanied
and
followed
by
proposals
for
replacing
civilization
by
concepts
forms
and
practices
more
in
keeping
with
the
social
relations
and
situations
resulting
from
the
current
world
revolution
most
reforms
of
civilization
have
been
attempted
during
the
life
of
western
civilization
because
during
that
era
both
the
structure
and
functioning
of
civilization
have
been
called
into
question
in
no
civilization
egypt
rome
or
the
modern
west
have
the
essential
principles
of
civilization
been
seriously
modified
again
and
again
during
the
times
of
trouble
that
marked
the
breakdown
of
successive
civilizations
particular
institutions
were
rejected
but
civilization
as
a
way
of
life
has
been
accepted
and
in
the
course
of
each
new
cycle
during
previous
cycles
the
breakdown
of
a
civilization
had
been
followed
by
a
period
of
rest
and
recuperation
before
the
beginning
of
the
next
experiment
the
breakdown
of
western
civilization
a
negative
reaction
has
been
accompanied
by
a
drive
to
replace
the
concepts
forms
and
practices
of
civilization
by
the
concepts
forms
and
practices
of
as
a
way
of
life
for
nations
and
continents
is
a
new
experiment
on
the
planet
earth
heretofore
there
have
been
small
groups
families
tribes
and
sects
that
have
adopted
and
followed
cooperation
as
a
way
of
life
but
widespread
planned
cooperation
on
a
national
or
continental
scale
is
a
novelty
as
a
result
of
these
changes
and
fragmenting
western
civilization
found
itself
divided
into
three
factional
groups
i
corporate
business
organized
domestically
and
internationally
to
preserve
and
extend
its
wealth
and
power
big
business
interests
their
dependents
and
backers
were
concentrated
chiefly
in
west
europe
and
north
america
their
network
of
interests
and
controls
was
literally
they
were
the
backbone
of
western
civilization
ii
builders
of
an
alternative
and
rival
life
pattern
have
been
concentrated
in
east
europe
and
asia
the
occupied
a
minority
position
in
most
of
the
countries
dominated
by
big
business
their
program
called
for
the
replacement
of
capitalist
competition
and
conflict
by
a
cooperating
planned
society
operated
for
service
rather
than
for
profit
iii
a
third
segment
made
up
largely
of
nations
and
peoples
located
in
africa
asia
and
latin
america
who
up
to
war
end
in
had
been
colonies
or
dependencies
of
the
big
business
directed
empires
since
they
have
become
increasingly
independent
and
the
division
of
the
planet
was
determined
in
part
by
the
ideas
principles
and
practices
of
civilized
peoples
during
the
past
six
thousand
years
in
part
it
was
the
outcome
of
the
revolution
of
it
was
likewise
the
result
of
the
wars
revolutions
and
independence
movements
that
have
upset
and
realigned
the
world
since
under
the
impact
of
these
forces
human
society
was
being
unmade
and
remade
by
comparison
with
its
own
beginnings
and
with
its
predecessors
western
civilization
has
made
many
changes
in
its
political
economic
and
sociological
way
of
life
it
has
also
developed
national
and
regional
variants
of
its
overall
pattern
despite
these
changes
and
with
the
possible
exception
of
its
very
large
and
significant
sector
the
west
has
retained
the
structural
and
functional
features
of
previous
civilizations
urban
nuclei
supporting
themselves
by
trade
commerce
and
finance
expansion
up
to
and
beyond
the
point
of
no
return
the
life
and
death
power
struggle
within
and
between
its
constituent
peoples
nations
and
empires
the
use
of
war
as
the
final
arbiter
in
these
struggles
the
rise
of
the
military
to
a
position
of
supremacy
in
policy
making
and
public
administration
an
pattern
of
exploitation
within
the
urban
nuclei
and
between
rival
provincial
factions
speculation
in
the
necessaries
of
life
the
growth
of
overhead
costs
far
beyond
the
increase
of
production
and
of
income
the
degradation
of
currency
multiple
taxation
the
abuse
of
credit
inflation
unemployment
and
chronic
hard
times
western
civilization
differs
from
its
predecessors
in
one
crucial
respect
it
is
previous
civilizations
known
to
history
have
been
limited
by
oceans
deserts
and
other
geographical
barriers
the
revolution
in
communication
and
transportation
has
geographic
barriers
the
french
saying
the
more
things
change
the
more
they
remain
the
same
finds
ample
justification
in
the
story
of
western
civilization
and
its
predecessors
in
one
instance
after
another
for
at
least
six
thousand
years
civilizations
have
been
built
up
to
summits
of
wealth
and
power
then
on
the
downward
sweep
of
the
cycle
they
have
declined
decayed
and
been
dumped
on
the
scrap
heap
of
history
no
two
of
these
cycles
were
exactly
alike
each
cycle
was
a
social
experiment
that
followed
a
well
marked
path
there
were
variations
innovations
deviations
from
the
norm
but
institutions
and
practices
were
strikingly
similar
in
this
broad
sense
and
despite
minor
departures
the
life
patterns
of
civilization
have
appeared
disappeared
and
reappeared
with
close
similarity
in
structure
and
function
western
civilization
has
had
a
life
cycle
of
approximately
a
thousand
years
during
that
millennium
it
has
undergone
many
changes
political
economic
sociological
ideological
throughout
these
changes
its
basic
characteristics
have
remained
have
appeared
and
reappeared
in
the
western
civilization
retains
the
essential
features
which
justify
us
in
describing
it
as
a
civilization
the
great
revolution
which
began
about
and
has
increased
in
breadth
and
depth
throughout
the
past
two
centuries
had
led
to
vital
changes
in
structure
and
functioning
particularly
of
the
west
but
generally
in
the
entirety
of
human
society
so
are
these
changes
and
so
deep
running
that
human
society
particularly
in
the
west
has
outgrown
or
is
outgrowing
the
life
pattern
evolved
by
civilizations
during
the
past
four
or
five
millenia
as
a
consequence
geographical
expansion
by
the
method
of
has
become
more
difficult
far
more
expensive
in
manpower
and
material
wealth
and
is
in
growing
disrepute
among
a
sizeable
minority
of
individuals
and
social
groups
even
in
the
centers
of
western
civilization
it
is
in
notable
disfavor
among
the
former
colonies
and
dependencies
of
the
european
empires
at
the
same
time
war
as
a
means
of
achieving
social
ends
has
fallen
into
greater
and
greater
disrepute
war
costs
measured
in
terms
of
human
and
welfare
had
soared
to
fantastic
heights
before
the
devastation
during
that
year
of
two
moderate
sized
cities
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
was
a
foretaste
of
the
increasingly
bleak
chances
of
human
survival
with
the
stockpiling
of
nuclear
weapons
far
more
destructive
than
the
fission
bombs
used
on
the
two
japanese
cities
under
the
conditions
prevailing
before
the
great
revolution
competitive
struggle
between
nations
and
empires
expanding
as
a
result
of
victory
in
war
had
ceased
to
be
a
practicable
means
of
gaining
holding
and
increasing
wealth
and
power
if
the
costs
of
the
international
power
struggle
exceeded
the
gains
there
were
no
longer
victors
who
won
and
vanquished
who
lost
instead
everybody
lost
as
the
entire
social
structure
was
wrenched
dislocated
wracked
and
certainly
this
seemed
to
be
the
lesson
of
the
two
general
wars
and
the
flurry
of
minor
wars
which
swept
the
earth
after
expansion
through
armed
struggle
no
longer
paid
its
way
it
was
the
obvious
lesson
stressed
by
hobson
and
nicolai
lenin
in
their
respective
studies
of
imperialism
and
it
was
the
theme
of
norman
angel
it
was
summarized
by
arnold
and
if
the
costs
of
expansion
exceeded
the
income
the
outcome
of
expansion
would
be
dismemberment
for
the
vanquished
and
bankruptcy
for
the
victors
indeed
this
formula
generalises
the
experience
of
the
survival
struggles
during
the
war
years
which
began
in
i
summarized
the
experience
in
twilight
of
the
catastrophic
economic
breakdown
during
the
great
depression
of
the
spectacular
and
fateful
rise
of
hitlerism
in
germany
after
the
destructive
civil
war
in
spain
from
to
followed
immediately
by
the
war
devastations
of
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
picture
the
same
may
be
said
for
the
revolt
of
the
colonial
peoples
downgrading
all
european
victors
in
the
war
of
and
the
social
revolutions
following
that
shook
up
the
planetary
power
structure
and
opened
the
way
for
forces
to
begin
socialist
construction
in
one
country
after
another
some
european
states
had
become
armed
to
the
teeth
surrounded
with
their
satellites
dependencies
and
colonies
they
expanded
exploited
and
battled
as
they
played
the
absorbing
and
ruinous
game
of
beggar
my
neighbor
politically
and
economically
the
struggle
reached
and
passed
its
high
point
between
and
the
subsequent
years
have
revealed
the
aftermath
a
europe
and
an
ascendant
asia
empire
building
has
been
made
prohibitively
expensive
by
the
revolution
in
science
and
technology
if
the
human
family
is
to
survive
in
anything
like
its
present
numbers
a
way
must
be
found
to
end
the
use
of
war
as
a
means
of
attaining
social
objectives
new
techniques
chiefly
must
be
discovered
and
employed
in
the
maintenance
of
social
relations
not
only
must
war
be
abandoned
as
a
means
of
achieving
social
objectives
but
exploitation
of
nature
and
man
must
be
superceded
by
a
life
style
that
conserves
natural
wealth
and
shifts
the
center
of
economic
endeavor
from
competition
to
cooperation
abandonment
of
war
as
an
instrument
of
policy
and
the
renunciation
of
exploitation
of
man
by
man
and
nation
by
nation
as
a
means
of
enrichment
would
put
an
end
to
the
scandalous
and
corrosive
extremes
of
riches
and
poverty
that
have
cursed
every
civilization
of
which
we
have
a
written
record
western
civilization
like
its
predecessors
had
consisted
of
rival
nations
and
empires
competing
for
wealth
position
expanding
territorially
as
they
exploited
nature
and
available
labor
power
for
the
advantage
of
the
few
civilization
as
a
life
style
built
around
the
competitive
struggle
for
wealth
and
power
using
war
as
an
instrument
of
policy
and
multiplying
the
techniques
of
expansion
and
exploitation
has
had
a
series
of
experimental
tryouts
already
under
way
at
the
dawn
of
written
history
under
no
circumstances
has
civilization
proved
to
be
wholly
rewarding
and
satisfying
the
current
revolution
in
science
and
technology
has
rendered
civilization
unreformable
as
well
as
obsolete
the
structure
or
pattern
of
civilization
has
divided
western
civilization
into
separate
parts
that
benefit
by
separateness
and
profit
from
conflict
the
result
is
a
typical
example
of
a
life
style
struggling
through
an
impasse
from
which
there
is
no
escape
save
through
a
third
fratricidal
war
today
civilization
is
a
bad
buy
especially
for
young
people
starting
out
in
life
civilization
still
has
its
advantages
for
those
who
have
lived
actively
achieved
many
of
their
material
objectives
and
retired
to
spend
their
declining
years
in
a
nest
for
some
privileged
young
people
willing
to
settle
for
comfort
and
conformity
civilization
offers
the
leisure
to
learn
and
an
opportunity
to
test
themselves
out
against
a
big
field
of
ardent
competitors
but
for
energetic
idealistic
young
people
the
opportunities
offered
by
western
civilization
are
deemed
inconsequential
trivial
and
in
the
long
run
inadequate
for
them
the
game
is
not
worth
the
candle
today
civilization
is
a
bad
buy
for
two
reasons
the
first
is
that
antisocial
predatory
exploitive
and
parasitic
elements
are
unfortunately
and
unnecessarily
prominent
in
the
lives
of
all
civilized
peoples
including
the
present
west
the
second
reason
is
the
arrogant
peremptory
bragging
bullying
dictatorial
approaches
adopted
by
civilized
people
in
their
dealings
with
those
who
live
on
the
fringes
or
outside
the
pale
of
civilization
the
first
reason
is
an
inescapable
consequence
of
the
political
economic
ideological
and
sociological
assumptions
of
the
civilizing
process
the
second
reason
is
inherent
in
the
methods
used
by
civilized
peoples
in
their
dealing
with
the
uncivilized
majority
of
humanity
steps
beyond
civilization
chapter

ten
building
blocks
for
a
new
world
in
the
previous
chapter
i
argued
that
we
are
marking
time
in
a
paradise
while
western
civilization
slips
backward
and
downward
toward
dissolution
and
oblivion
like
many
of
its
predecessors
our
civilization
seems
to
have
exhausted
its
capacity
to
create
progress
advance
instead
it
is
disintegrating
and
breaking
up
in
our
current
time
of
troubles
in
an
earlier
epoch
of
human
history
civilization
helped
to
bridge
the
wide
gap
between
man
the
victim
and
plaything
of
nature
and
man
as
the
user
director
and
to
a
limited
degree
the
coordinator
of
natural
forces
today
questions
of
our
demise
or
our
survival
and
advance
are
pressing
and
urgent
civilization
has
played
an
important
role
in
the
social
history
of
mankind
during
the
several
thousand
years
when
segments
of
the
human
family
have
turned
their
backs
on
barbarism
regrouped
their
forces
revamped
their
patterns
of
association
and
experimented
with
the
more
complicated
specialized
and
integrated
life
pattern
of
civilization
these
experiments
have
paralleled
or
followed
one
another
separated
by
shorter
or
longer
ages
of
rest
and
recuperation
each
epoch
of
civilization
has
contributed
ideas
artifacts
and
institutions
to
the
sum
total
of
human
culture
this
has
been
the
case
with
past
civilizations
it
is
true
of
western
civilization
civilization
like
other
aspects
of
human
culture
is
never
static
but
always
dynamic
it
changes
constantly
waxing
and
waning
it
develops
expands
and
contracts
it
reaches
out
toward
universality
then
breaks
down
and
dissolves
into
a
welter
of
conflicting
regional
and
local
interest
groups
these
changes
are
the
outcome
of
experience
they
are
related
to
alterations
in
ideas
outlooks
and
purposes
they
are
often
associated
with
technical
discoveries
and
inventions
they
come
and
go
in
more
or
less
clearly
defined
cycles
they
are
influenced
by
deep
running
political
economic
and
social
forces
and
trends
each
civilization
matures
into
forms
and
develops
functions
and
institutions
that
tend
to
consolidate
and
crystallize
in
well
defined
social
patterns
and
habit
grooves
in
which
two
forces
oppose
each
other
one
force
is
status
preserving
that
which
is
the
other
force
is
change
that
which
tends
to
become
or
is
becoming
status
and
change
confront
each
other
at
all
social
levels
during
periods
of
rapid
social
change
they
take
the
center
of
the
stage
and
dominate
the
drama
the
revolution
of
is
an
outstanding
example
of
rapid
change
the
current
opposition
of
status
and
change
has
pushed
other
aspects
of
social
life
into
second
place
and
has
made
the
social
status
of
yesterday
outmoded
today
and
obsolete
tomorrow
the
disintegration
of
western
civilization
indicated
by
its
time
of
troubles
is
having
profound
effects
on
western
man
the
effects
are
physical
mental
energenic
and
moral
for
individuals
socially
they
find
expression
in
vandalism
hooliganism
major
crime
in
the
of
the
family
in
alienation
inertia
boredom
in
laxity
indiscipline
loss
of
faith
weakness
or
absence
of
purpose
most
serious
of
all
perhaps
western
peoples
are
learning
to
ignore
principle
live
for
the
moment
satisfy
their
already
sated
appetites
and
pay
little
or
no
attention
to
the
future
these
attitudes
are
widespread
in
the
western
world
of
the
particularly
among
the
young
these
effects
on
the
whole
negative
are
offset
by
a
number
of
positive
factors
human
beings
are
curious
and
imaginative
they
are
also
ingenious
inventive
and
intuitive
all
of
these
attributes
are
assets
when
dealing
with
the
future
and
the
unknown
in
a
previous
generation
preceding
the
war
of
a
very
large
part
of
the
west
was
under
the
influence
of
the
christian
church
which
promised
good
things
in
the
hereafter
during
the
ensuing
years
of
military
conflict
planned
destruction
and
wholesale
murder
another
considerable
part
of
the
west
both
socialist
and
liberal
was
promising
security
comfort
and
convenience
here
and
now
the
influence
of
the
christian
church
on
life
style
even
among
its
own
membership
has
declined
in
the
past
half
century

meanwhile
has

important

with

and
amenities
far
beyond
the
levels
imagined
by
reformers
and
revolutionaries
of
a
previous
generation
as
an
integral
part
of
this
maturing
revolutionary
situation
a
generation
of
human
beings
born

has
come
on
the
scene
surrounded
by
the

in
both

the
more

members
of
this
generation
have
turned
their
backs
on

and
begun
shouting
a
new
slogan
we
want
to

there
is
nothing
surprising
about
this
development
many
trained

observers
have
been
predicting
it
youth

can
not

with

in

they
want
to

are
not
content
merely
to

affluence
and
social

can
not
satisfy
they
merely
sharpen
the
appetite
for
a
continuance
of
the
life
journey
on
the
best
terms
permitted
by
the
current
time
of
troubles
among
the
members
of
the
generation
this
ambitious
perceptive
elite
is
aware
of
two
disturbing
and
compelling
realities
the
first
is
the
peril
to
mankind
implicit
in
a
continuance
along
its
present
disaster
course
of
war
with
its
inescapable
counterpart
social
dissolution
the
second
is
the
possibility
that
out
of
the
wreckage
and
rubble
of
an
outmoded
cultural
pattern
a
mature
chastened
more
experienced
more
consciously
purposive
generation
will
arise
possessing
the
wit
to
see
the
necessity
of
creative
advance
and
the
wisdom
to
guide
the
pioneers
of
humanity
along
the
difficult
and
dangerous
path
that
they
must
follow
if
they
are
to
reach
the
land
of
purpose
and
promise
current
frustrating
experience
with
the
breakdown
of
western
civilization
coupled
with
historical
precedents
confront
the
present
generation
of
mankind
with
a
compelling
challenge
and
a
unique
precious
opportunity
the
challenge
arises
out
of
experiments
with
particular
civilizations
and
with
civilization
as
a
way
of
life
our
analysis
of
this
situation
leads
to
only
one
possible
conclusion
repeated
experiments
with
civilization
unmask
it
as
a
way
not
of
life
but
as
a
cycle
of
rise
expansion
maturity
decline
and
certain
death
the
challenge
is
emphasized
by
the
failure
of
reforms
and
reformers
of
civilization
to
make
changes
in
structure
and
function
sufficient
to
meet
the
challenge
of
the
cycle
nor
has
it
been
possible
for
western
civilization
to
take
advantage
of
the
drastic
changes
and
challenges
arising
out
of
the
current
world
revolution
man
top
negative
priority
at
the
present
moment
is
to
reject
the
wiles
the
temptations
the
mortal
conflicts
and
the
annihilative
destruction
which
have
disrupted
and
decimated
civilized
society
during
the
past
six
thousand
years
and
reached
their
apex
in
the
great
revolution
of
these
experiences
prove
beyond
the
shadow
of
doubt
that
this
pattern
of
human
collective
life
is
inadequate
to
meet
the
present
and
future
needs
of
the
human
family
man
top
positive
priority
is
the
occupancy
of
the
planet
earth
by
million
human
beings
who
wish
to
survive
to
utilize
and
conserve
the
natural
habitat
and
to
improve
the
social
environment
within
narrow
limits
almost
all
members
of
the
human
family
want
to
live
and
to
help
other
humans
to
do
likewise
multitudes
of
human
beings
particularly
among
the
youth
want
to
enjoy
outward
looking
satisfying
productive
creative
lives
they
also
want
those
near
and
dear
to
do
the
same
thing
what
steps
must
they
take
in
order
to
realize
their
hope
and
fulfill
their
aspirations
broadly
speaking
they
must
pick
their
way
warily
through
the
maze
of
artifacts
gadgets
and
gimmicks
produced
by
human
ingenuity
during
the
current
world
revolution
most
of
them
are
superficial
and
time
consuming
a
few
are
fundamental
they
are
of
the
utmost
importance
as
implements
to
human
advance
taking
what
advantage
they
can
of
recent
innovations
avoiding
and
illusion
leading
to
rainbows
the
more
sensitive
and
more
competent
segments
of
mankind
must
close
ranks
and
move
upward
and
onward
to
a
new
level
of
culture
the
chief
instrument
available
for
such
an
enterprise
is
the
twentieth
century
version
of
the
political
state
the
bourgeois
revolution
was
achieved
through
the
developing
evolving
political
state
the
political
state
is
the
binding
force
that
held
scattered
fragments
of
the
human
family
together
during
the
stresses
and
strains
of
the
current
revolution
in
science
and
technology
it
is
the
political
state
that
must
be
depended
upon
to
resist
the
fragmentating
forces
of
a
disintegrating
western
civilization
to
preserve
the
social
structure
and
administer
human
society
through
the
transition
from
civilization
into
the
structure
and
functioning
of
the
new
social
order
which
is
presently
supplanting
civilization
through
europe
transition
from
feudalism
to
capitalism
the
feudal
state
here
and
there
step
by
step
was
replaced
by
the
bourgeois
state
as
the
chief
structural
building
block
of
western
civilization
the
bourgeois
revolution
in
various
parts
of
europe
lasted
for
several
centuries
the
process
was
well
under
way
by
as
lately
as
feudal
pockets
remained
in
eastern
europe
an
even
more
profound
transformation
of
european
society
is
made
in
the
course
of
the
great
revolution
of
the
transformation
is
in
its
early
stages
during
the
process
the
political
life
of
will
be
administered
by
the
political
institutions
of
the
bourgeois
state
together
with
the
closely
related
state
patterns
of
which
have
come
into
being
during
the
present
century
during
this
transition
the
bourgeois
state
itself
has
evolved
at
the
outset
it
was
a
revolutionary
force
devoting
its
energies
to
the
elimination
of
feudal
institutions
and
practices
and
replacing
them
by
the
institutions
and
practices
needed
for
the
advancement
of
bourgeois
interests
today
the
bourgeois
state
is
a
bulwark
of
conservatism
devoting
its
energies
to
the
preservation
of
bourgeois
forms
and
practices
and
doing
its
utmost
to
fulfill
its
role
of
resisting
and
if
possible
destroying
the
institutions
and
practices
needed
to
replace
the
political
institutions
and
practices
of
civilization
by
the
new
institutions
required
to
move
mankind
from
the
outmoded
lifestyle
of
civilization
to
a
lifestyle
beyond
and
above
that
to
which
humanity
has
become
adapted
during
the
now
obsolete
epoch
of
civilization
at
the
same
time
the
variant
of
the
bourgeois
state
pattern
is
providing
the
framework
within
which
the
institutions
and
practices
needed
for
the
transition
from
civilization
to
a
newer
and
more
universal
social
order
are
being
matured
at
the
next
stage
in
the
birth
process
the
institutions
and
practices
necessary
for
upbuilding
the
social
order
that
will
replace
civilization
are
being
worked
out
in
theory
and
embodied
in
experimental
practice
in
practice
an
accurate
distinction
must
be
made
between
the
conservative
bourgeois
state
the
temporary
transitional
state
and
the
universal
state
that
will
shepherd
humanity
along
the
difficult
and
dangerous
path
of
the
political
life
pattern
beyond
civilization
in
theory
such
distinctions
are
needed
as
part
of
the
scaffolding
within
which
the
social
pattern
of
will
be
constructed
like
most
decisive
epochs
of
human
history
the
revolution
through
which
we
are
passing
has
had
both
a
negative
and
a
positive
aspect
in
chapter
i
wrote
about
one
of
its
destructive
aspects
the
extreme
destructivity
of
two
periods
of
general
war
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
list
ten
positive
contributions
made
by
the
same
revolution
toward
the
development
of
a
social
life
style
that
is
offering
itself
as
an
alternative
to
civilization
new
sources
of
energy
up
to
human
beings
had
the
energy
of
the
human
body
plus
the
energy
of
domestic
animals
they
used
wind
to
turn
mills
and
sail
ships
and
water
to
turn
crude
wheels
they
also
burned
various
things
particularly
vegetable
fibres
to
produce
heat
during
the
revolution
they
have
learned
to
use
steam
electricity
and
chemical
explosives
recently
they
have
learned
to
use
the
energy
in
the
atom
to
use
water
power
extensively
and
to
a
slight
extent
the
energy
of
the
sun
and
the
tides
the
revolution
has
taught
people
who
previously
feared
change
to
welcome
change
and
take
full
advantage
of
discoveries
and
inventions
that
modified
nature
and
profoundly
altered
human
society
among
the
inventions
were
the
extensive
use
of
the
wheel
for
movement
on
land
the
use
of
steam
engines
and
electric
motors
for
moving
manufacturing
and
transportation
and
the
use
of
electricity
for
communication
increased
human
mobility
on
land
and
water
and
more
recently
in
the
air
and
still
more
recently
in
outer
space
easy
and
rapid
movement
and
almost
instantaneous
communication
brought
people
together
in
towns
and
cities
built
up
trade
in
goods
and
services
increased
speed
of
communications
and
enabled
people
living
at
a
distance
from
one
another
to
keep
in
close
touch
bringing
human
enterprises
and
human
beings
into
continuing
contact
human
life
thought
and
action
were
coordinated
increased
mobility
unified
human
society
research
is
now
an
accepted
aspect
of
all
phases
of
human
life
and
activity
research
is
a
recognized
occupation
research
teams
solve
problems
map
the
paths
of
enterprise
we
are
learning
first
to
think
then
only
after
careful
study
decide
on
courses
of
action
and
follow
them
through
the
field
of
inquiry
and
research
covered
the
entire
range
of
human
experience
information
resulting
from
research
provided
the
subject
matter
of
new
sciences
in
the
new
fields
new
skills
were
developed
and
new
professions
built
up
the
members
of
this
new
technological
intelligentsia
added
to
the
learned
professions
created
a
large
group
who
expected
and
enjoyed
affluent

increased
the
number
of

that
enjoyed

mass
produced
and

in
a
mass

lifting
people
out

ceased
to

instead
people
learned
the

a
new

management
with
the
necessary
planning

cost
keeping
large
numbers
of

human

created
the

people
especially
young
people
to
take
part
in
voluntary
group
projects
and
create
such
experiences

social
awareness
and
led
to
large
scale
mass
action
people
growing
up
in
affluence
living
above
the
rigors
of
poverty
asked
questions
about
themselves
their
society
and
the
universe
in
which
they
lived
they
learned
that
they
and
their
fellows
had
not
only
the
five
accepted
senses
but
additional
senses
with
corresponding
experiences
this
opened
their
eyes
to
the
possibility
of
additional
or
extra
senses
opening
the
immense
field
of
extra
sensory
perception
these
ten
areas
opening

largely
during

of

which
a
new

is
coming
into

chapter
fourteen
moving
toward
world
federation
one
of
man
earliest
collective
experiences
is
summed
up
in
the
saying
united
we
stand
divided
we
fall
united
we
survive
and
prosper
divided
we
quarrel
fight
and
sooner
or
later
break
up
into
smaller
sovereign
competing
groups
if
human
beings
wish
to
utilize
nature
or
to
enjoy
the
advantages
of
collective
action
and
group
life
they
must
get
together
and
stay
together
this
necessity
for
collective
action
has
appeared
and
reappeared
all
through
written
history
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
lessons
of
human
experience
it
holds
for
families
neighborhoods
villages
cities
nations
for
mankind
as
a
whole
it
is
joint
action
for
the
general
welfare
the
principle
of
collective
action
has
been
recognized
and
put
into
practice
during
the
ten
centuries
that
span
the
rise
of
western
civilization
put
into
practice
up
to
a
certain
point
the
nation
or
the
empire
beyond
that
point
collective
action
has
taken
two
forms
competition
and
conflict
including
war
and
coordination
or
cooperation
under
agreement
contract
or
treaty
among
the
outstanding
results
of
the
great
revolution
improvement
in
communication
and
transportation
have
brought
humans
into
contact
with
one
another
on
an
increasingly
extensive
scale
reaching
its
high
water
mark
in
networks
of
trade
travel
migration
and
diplomacy
leading
up
to
the
one
world
which
was
so
much
in
the
foreground
of
public
discussions
between
the
two
general
wars
of
and
much
has
been
written
on
the
subject
i
contributed
by
two
bits
in
next
a
book
published
in
and
published
in
perhaps
the
most
critical
failure
of
western
civilization
was
its
inability
or
unwillingness
to
take
that
next
step
during
the
decisive
years
that
followed
the
hague
conference
of
in
listing
the
ten
building
blocks
for
a
new
world
chapter
of
this
book
i
began
with
world
federation
because
in
terms
of
the
public
life
of
the
earth
around
the
planet
was
divided
into
two
alliances
of
nations
and
empires
the
allies
headed
by
great
britain
and
the
central
powers
headed
by
germany
instead
of
cooperating
to
gain
their
declared
objectives
of
peace
prosperity
and
progress
these
two
power
blocs
engaged
in
an
armament
race
from
to
leading
up
to
general
war
in
with
a
second
general
war
between
the
rivals
in
when
i
was
organizing
part
ii
of
this
study
a
social
analysis
of
civilization
i
had
to
decide
whether
to
begin
with
economics
or
politics
as
an
economist
i
was
inclined
to
put
economics
first
but
since
the
study
centered
on
civilization
and
since
all
known
civilizations
were
not
groupings
of
economic
subdivisions
but
aggregates
of
nations
empires
and
their
dependencies
and
since
the
expansion
of
civilization
has
consisted
in
enlarging
the
geographical
area
of
the
civilization
in
question
i
decided
to
begin
with
politics
as
the
study
has
progressed
i
have
seen
no
reason
for
reversing
the
choice
on
the
contrary
since
i
began
collecting
data
for
this
study
at
the
time
of
the
first
general
war
i
have
watched
the
unfolding
political
struggle
for
economic
and
cultural
objectives
with
the
increasing
conviction
that
politics
is
the
primary
focus
with
economic
forces
always
in
play
but
usually
in
the
background
leaving
the
center
of
the
stage
to
politics
this
is
another
way
of
saying
that
the
world
is
divided
primarily
into
political
nation
states
rather
than
into
areas
of
economic
function
always
economics
is
important
but
at
least
superficially
political
considerations
are
in
the
foreground
to
clinch
decisions
a
time
may
come
when
economists
or
sociologists
occupy
the
central
offices
where
primary
decisions
are
made
that
time
has
not
yet
arrived
in
so
far
as
the
present
generation
is
concerned
politics
is
in
the
foreground
the
politicians
make
the
crucial
announcements
and
sign
the
key
documents
therefore
our
survey
of
the
steps
beyond
civilization
begins
with
politics
our
attention
centers
on
the
political
aspects
of
world
federation
with
economic
considerations
present
and
always
operating
but
not
dominating
the
crucial
decisions
for
better
or
worse
in
and
the
years
immediately
succeeding
we
will
be
living
on
a
planet
divided
into
some
politically
sovereign
states
in
view
of
the
widespread
pressure
toward
the
number
of
sovereign
states
has
increased
considerably
especially
since
war
end
in
presumably
the
principal
united
we
stand
applies
to
those
sovereign
states
sovereignty
includes
the
right
of
self
determination
putting
the
interests
of
one
particular
state
above
the
interests
of
the
entire
family
of
nations
the
part
before
the
whole
here
is
a
contradiction
and
a
possible
conflict
of
interest
britain
prime
minister
heath
like
many
another
spokesman
in
his
position
summed
up
the
issue
in
the
pithy
phrase
british
interests
come
first
if
the
french
italian
japanese
and
other
prime
ministers
take
a
similar
stand
implied
by
the
principle
of
sovereignty
situations
are
bound
to
arise
in
which
the
interests
of
two
or
more
nations
clash
opening
the
way
for
conflicts
at
many
levels
differences
of
interpretation
negotiations
in
the
course
of
which
concessions
may
be
made
by
both
parties
the
differences
may
be
settled
by
diplomats
sitting
around
conference
tables
or
by
armies
on
the
battlefield
with
sovereign
states
on
the
planet
the
probability
of
conflict
would
seem
to
be
overwhelming
as
a
matter
of
daily
experience
such
confrontations
and
conflicts
do
occur
most
of
them
are
handled
by
negotiation
a
few
lead
to
armed
struggle
since
sovereign
states
exist
on
one
earth
means
must
be
found
that
will
enable
them
to
if
possible
without
conflict
and
certainly
without
military
conflict
the
means
generally
relied
upon
today
for
dealing
with
such
problems
is
negotiation
between
representatives
of
all
parties
at
interest
at
the
national
level
this
would
mean
negotiations
between
representatives
of
the
involved
governments
negotiations
between
representatives
of
various
governments
are
always
going
on
dealing
with
political
economic
and
cultural
issues
within
each
nation
such
negotiations
are
conducted
between
spokesmen
for
various
government
departments
internationally
they
are
conducted
by
representatives
of
various
governments
working
through
their
diplomatic
or
consular
services
within
each
nation
and
between
nations
confrontations
may
be
settled
by
negotiation
at
each
level
they
may
result
in
armed
conflict
governments
exist
to
deal
with
conflicts
and
where
possible
to
resolve
them
before
they
reach
the
shooting
stage
this
is
notably
true
in
domestic
affairs
because
there
are
usually
public
officials
charged
with
the
duty
of
dealing
with
problems
internationally
unless
there
is
an
international
agency
such
as
the
universal
postal
union
of
the
organization
of
american
states
the
issue
must
be
settled
by
special
representatives
of
the
parties
the
argument
for
a
world
government
begins
with
the
assumption
that
means
should
exist
to
deal
with
international
issues
before
they
reach
an
acute
stage
such
means
exist
within
each
local
government
similar
arrangements
should
exist
at
the
international
level
to
deal
with
issues
that
arise
between
governments
the
political
core
of
a
social
stage
beyond
civilization
will
be
a
international
regional
and
local
network
of
institutions
integrated
coordinated
and
administered
on
the
federal
principle
local
affairs
controlled
locally
regional
affairs
controlled
regionally
international
affairs
controlled
by
a
political
authority
such
a
relationship
would
imply
states
rights
for
the
local
authority
regional
rights
for
the
regional
authority
and
full
awareness
in
the
central
authority
of
the
possibility
at
this
juncture
of
establishing
order
justice
and
mercy
on
the
planetary
level
in
our
present
terminology
a
world
government
basic
to
this
federal
structure
would
be
the
jeffersonian
assumption
that
government
governs
best
which
governs
least
with
an
amendment
provided
that
the
authority
in
question
governs
sufficiently
to
establish
and
maintain
physical
health
social
decency
order
justice
and
mercy
in
reasonable
proportions
throughout
the
area
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
at
each
level
local
national
regional
and
planetary
there
will
be
committees
councils
or
other
authorities
with
full
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
public
administration
at
the
local
the
national
the
regional
and
the
planetary
or
international
level
currently
the
federal
principle
is
widely
established
at
local
and
national
levels
attempts
are
being
made
in
various
regions
to
effectuate
stable
authorities
at
the
regional
level
such
as
the
united
states
of
north
america
or
the
united
states
of
mexico
there
has
been
much
talk
of
government
established
by
one
wealthy
and
militarily
powerful
nation
over
its
peers
or
by
a
voluntary
association
with
its
peers
institutions
established
thus
far
league
of
nations
the
united
nations
the
world
court
the
universal
postal
union
have
fallen
far
short
of
stable
all
inclusive
political
authority
at
the
moment
there
are
states
which
are
members
of
the
united
nations
there
are
perhaps
an
additional
score
of
nations
which
have
applied
for
membership
or
which
might
be
accepted
if
they
made
an
application
accept
this
rounded
figure
and
we
have
perhaps
nations
or
potential
nations
on
the
planet
some
are
long
established
and
stable
other
nations
are
with
small
populations
few
resources
and
minimal
means
of
defense
or
offense
by
and
large
this
is
the
family
of
nations
which
might
be
coordinated
into
an
effective
world
authority
which
would
be
responsible
for
order
decency
and
peace
in
a
federally
coordinated
world
world
authority
to
be
effective
and
reasonably
stable
must
be
equipped
with
sufficient
delegated
powers
to
maintain
orderly
and

between
its
members
establish
peace
and
carry
out
policies
necessary
to
provide
and
promote
ecological
and
sociological
welfare
to
achieve
such
results
it
must
have
a
balance
between
central
authority
and
it
must
also
enjoy
sufficient
to
provide
for
social
change
and
for
consistent
social
improvement
the
goal
of
world
government
as
of
any
political
enterprise
that
pretends
to
represent
human

will
be
social

for

is
the
theory

of

any

situation
executives
and
administrators
in
los

tokyo
or
in
the

will

in

of

principles
such
as
those
stated
in
the

they
will
also
face
specific
situations
arising
out
of

which
differ
profoundly
from
continent

nation
to

and

in
the

human
communities
have
sought
and
found
different
means
of
dealing
with
the
problems
of
community
administration
at
one
extreme
of
social
administration
are
various
types
of
arbitrary
personal
dictatorships
the
greeks
called
them
tyrannies
arbitrary
rule
by
individuals
or
small
groups
subject
only
to
their
own
decisions
at
the
other
extreme
are
social
groups
that
arrive
at
decisions
as
the
outcome
of
discussion
in
which
all
group
members
may
take
part
group
decisions
may
require
unanimity
or
they
may
be
the
outcome
of

with
a

or

carrying
with
it
the
right
and
duty
to
put

into

as

of
the
public
life
of
the
community
various
forms
of
government
have
been
established
locally
and
regionally
at
the
level
of
a
civilization
the
government
has
been
established
almost
universally
as
the
outcome
of
armed
struggle
and
military
conquest
and
has
been
exercised
through
the
use
of
armed
force
in
the
hands
of
armed
minorities
a
century
without
general
war
to
led
to
a
widespread
assumption
that
peace
and
prosperity
could
be
established
and
maintained
by
preserving
a
balance
between
the
armed
forces
of
individual
nations
or
alliances
hence
there
need
be
no
more
general
wars
fought
for
survival
or
supremacy
the
bitter
struggle
for
markets
raw
materials
and
colonies
that
followed
the
war
of
developed
into
an
armament
race
after
from
the
hague
peace
conference
of
to
the
outbreak
of
general
war
in
desperate
efforts
were
made
to
maintain
the
and
avert
a
general
war
the
failure
of
these
efforts
proved
the
ineffectiveness
of
the
formula
today
it
is
generally
taken
for
granted
that
a
balance
of
power
between
armed
nations
is
no
guarantee
of
peace
and
order
it
is
also
taken
for
granted
that
frivolous
talk
like
that
of
an
american
century
after
has
no
justification
in
the
light
of
history
as
matters
now
stand
neither
a
balance
between
rival
armed
powers
nor
the
domination
of
the

by
any

can
be
relied
upon
to
maintain

chapter
fifteen
integrating
a
world
economy
repeated
efforts
have
been
made
to
establish
widely
ranging
economies
this
was
the
case
during
egyptian
and
phoenician
civilizations
it
was
certainly
true
of
the
economy
of
the
roman
empire
and
of
roman
civilization
such
efforts
faced
drastic
limitations
the
most
formidable
was
the
narrow
margin
of
surplus
produced
by
hand
labor
in
the
forests
on
the
fields
and
in
the
workshops
operated
in
the
main
with
hand
tools
with
minor
inputs
of
energy
supplied
by
domestic
animals
and
with
the
small
amounts
derived
from
wind
and
moving
water
two
further
limitations
existed
first
as
each
civilization
matured
its
leaders
and
policy
makers
ceased
to
labor
on
the
land
or
in
the
workshops
preferring
to
keep
their
hands
and
clothes
clean
to
free
themselves
from
irksome
demanding
toil
and
devote
themselves
to
tasks
more
befitting
gentlefolk
this
was
notably
true
of
landlords
as
a
class
it
was
also
true
of
the
richer
traders
merchants
and
moneylenders
particularly
of
the
third
and
fourth
generations
expansion
of
empires
and
the
civilizations
which
they
developed
entailed
military
operations
military
operations
in
their
turn
produced
who
must
earn
their
keep
and
if
possible
something
more
sold
in
the
market
to
the
highest
bidder
war
captives
and
their
descendants
became
chattel
slaves
as
civilizations
were
expanded
by
conquest
and
matured
by
struggle
they
developed
some
type
of
forced
labor
to
balance
the
increased
parasitism
of
the
masters
and
the
growing
numbers
who
were
called
upon
to
produce
services
rather
than
material
goods
certain
areas
of
civilized
economies
were
taken
over
by
the
public
authorities
planning
and
building
of
cities
and
their
ports
of
highways
including
bridges
of
viaducts
aqueducts
of
drainages
for
the
cities
of
public
buildings
the
construction
of
defenses
including
city
walls
were
partly
or
wholly
public
enterprises
temples
and
tombs
for
the
mighty
were
often
in
the
same
category
maintenance
of
large
elaborate
households
by
political
leaders
and
in
later
periods
of
empire
building
by
the
successful
merchants
and
technicians
led
to
the
employment
of
many
servants
including
subordinate
members
and
relatives
of
the
elite
much
necessary
labor
was
performed
by
members
of
each
household
the
resulting
economy
was
therefore
fragmented
at
the
household
level
with
virtually
all
of
the
energy
supplied
by
human
beings
and
domestic
animals
as
each
civilization
developed
its
pattern
of
forced
labor
including
the
labor
of
war
captives
it
launched
the
deadly
competition
between
freemen
and
slaves
which
almost
inevitably
ended
in
favor
of
the
slaves
who
were
housed
and
fed
by
the
masters
and
who
could
operate
at
overhead
costs
lower
than
those
involved
in
the
hiring
of
wage
or
salaried
workers
land
ownership
tended
to
center
in
the
leaders
the
temples
and
as
each
civilization
matured
in
the
hands
of
its
bourgeoisie
integrating
such
economies
proved
to
be
a
difficult
arduous
task
well
beyond
the
powers
of
the
average
political
military
or
hereditary
leader
in
a
very
real
sense
the
problems
of
management
were
extremely
personal
and
correspondingly
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
skillful
acquisitors
nowhere
was
the
impact
of
the
revolution
more
far
reaching
than
in
the
area
of
management
economic
activities
in
the
course
of
the
great
revolution
had
less
and
less
connection
with
the
homestead
and
except
for
a
tiny
minority
of
the
personnel
had
no
connection
with
the
family
of
the
the
seat
of
the
family
the
home
continued
to
exist
but
on
a
far
more
restricted
basis
arts
and
crafts
moved
from
the
household
into
the
workshop
where
they
expanded
both
in
extent
and
in
complexity
domestic
tasks
were
associated
with
hand
labor
and
simple
tools
the
great
revolution
filled
the
workshop
with
the
ancestors
of
present
day
machinery
but
with
a
prodigious
difference
in
the
early
step
from
home
workshop
to
factory
hand
tools
in
plenty
were
being
used
in
the
workshops
as
modernization
progressed
hand
tools
were
replaced
by
specialized
machines
the
implements
of
specialization
the
machine
building
tools
and
the
machine
tools
themselves
were
housed
in
forests
of
associated
workshops
the
mechanics
of
specialization
sprawled
over
acres
and
square
miles
of
factory
floor
space
nowhere
were
the
results
of
the
great
revolution
more
in
evidence
than
in
the
vast
difference
between
the
workshop
attached
to
the
house
of
the
early
industrialist
and
the
forest
of
chimneys
and
stacks
and
the
acres
and
square
miles
of
floorspace
in
industrial
establishments
with
their
personnel
numbered
in
thousands
and
the
capital
invested
in
plant
and
equipment
running
into
the
millions
or
billions
of
dollars
two
centuries
of
the
great
revolution
have
given
industrial
society
a
capital
plant
the
like
of
which
has
never
existed
on
the
planet
in
any
historical
period
after
two
hundred
years
of
meteoric
development
it
exists
today
on
a
scale
and
at
a
level
of
dominance
undreamed
of
even
up
to
the
middle
of
the
last
century
modern
industry
plants
steel
plants
cement
plants
open
pit
mines
textile
plants
machine
tool
plants
auto
plants
rubber
factories
oil
refineries
not
only
occupy
extensive
acreage
per
plant
but
the
same
interests
and
corporate
managements
operate
dozens
of
plants
in
widely
separated
geographical
areas
and
produce
a
great
variety
of
goods
and
services
an
experienced
observer
feels
entirely
at
home
in
any
industrial
center
on
any
continent
in
detroit
in
dusseldorf
in
osaka
in
shanghai
in
bombay
the
architecture
of
the
plants
is
essentially
the
same
the
machines
in
the
widely
separated
plants
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
one
another
and
the
problems
of
management
are
similar
unit
plants
and
their
coordinated
managements
in
the
aggregate
compose
the
world
economy
they
are
the
essence
of
its
being
they
occupy
the
skyline
and
dominate
the
economic
life
of
modern
industrial
society
they
are
the
units
which
make
up
the
of
modern
industry
which
in
its
turn
is
the
bony
structure
around
which
have
grown
the
sinews
and
muscle
of
planetary
economy
modern
state
structure
goes
back
through
the
half
dozen
centuries
during
which
it
has
been
developing
its
ancestors
may
be
met
with
in
the
history
of
previous
civilizations
modern
industrial
structure
on
the
other
hand
is
something
essentially
new
under
the
sun
newly
imagined
designed
constructed
productive
it
has
no
ancestry
before
because
its
essential
building
unit
the
modern
machine
did
not
exist
previous
to
that
date
in
the
last
chapter
we
dealt
with
the
growth
of
states
into
empires
and
the
aggregation
of
empires
into
civilizations
with
the
possibility
that
the
existing
states
could
be
welded
into
a
world
federation
one
of
the
chief
obstacles
to
such
a
development
is
the
centuries
of
conflict
during
which
modern
nations
have
been
built
up
and
the
strong
bonds
of
nationalism
have
been
established
as
a
means
of
holding
divergent
groups
of
people
in
line
by
particular
oligarchies
operating
in
particular
civilizations
on
the
economic
level
such
difficulties
are
minimal
the
process
of
coordination
and
consolidation
was
far
advanced
before
the
end
of
the
last
century
the
practice
of
integration
joining
productive
units
in
functional
sequences
was
also
accepted
and
followed
with
little
regard
for
political
or
cultural
considerations
the
result
has
been
an
economic
integration
which
has
developed
inside
the
chief
industrial
nations
and
across
national
boundaries
despite
political
obstacles
economic
integration
has
proceeded
with
giant
strides
especially
during
the
past
hundred
years
under
a
well
developed
world
political
federation
the
world
economy
could
be
integrated
and
used
to
provide
the
necessaries
conveniences
and
minimal
comforts
for
the
entire
human
family
there
are
nationalistic
obstacles
to
political
federation
economic
integration
is
an
obvious
must
and
a
logical
outcome
of
the
industrial
integration
that
has
gone
on
so
swiftly
during
the
great
revolution
of
when
we
talk
about
integrating
the
world
economy
we
are
dealing
with
a
problem
which
no
previous
civilization
has
faced
because
no
previous
civilization
had
machines
or
the
social
and
cultural
institutions
which
have
grouped
themselves
around
the
machine
phenomena
world
economy
in
includes
three
essential
elements
the
planet
earth
and
its
resources
the
institutional
structure
of
modern
society
and
human
beings
with
their
diverse
concepts
and
skills
which
provide
its
motive
force
these
three
factors
land
capital
equipment
and
human
energy
are
the
apparatus
upon
which
billion
human
beings
depend
for
the
goods
and
services
which
sustain
them
from
day
to
day
and
year
to
year
at
an
earlier
period
this
economic
apparatus
centered
around
the
land
and
its
cultivation
agriculture
since
the
onset
of
the
great
revolution
the
goods
and
services
have
come
increasingly
from
a
centered
occupational
apparatus
when
we
consider
the
integration
of
the
world
economy
it
is
this
industrialized
modern
economy
that
we
have
chiefly
in
mind
no
previous
civilization
faced
such
a
problem
there
are
no
real
precedents
upon
which
we
can
rely
we
must
go
forward
if
we
do
go
forward
experimenting
with
problems
which
face
the
human
family
for
the
first
time
the
integration
of
planetary
economy
in
is
a
total
or
unitary
problem
it
is
not
a
problem
of
one
continent
of
one
nation
or
empire
of
one
racial
or
cultural
group
it
is
a
problem
which
the
human
family
faces
as
a
human
family
occupying
our
planet
earth
it
is
our
capital
equipment
it
is
the
success
with
which
we
apply
our
to
the
earth
using
our
capital
equipment
and
our
skills
producing
the
goods
and
services
upon
which
our

as

of

posed
even

which
have

brought
the

isolated

face

with

on

these

are
in

must
be

have
learned
often
the
hard

how
to

act
in

of
their

or
more
concretely
in
the
interest
of
their

it
is
with
politics

of
this
level
that
we
of
the
present
generation
are
particularly
concerned
dwellers
in
western
europe
and
north

have
to
deal
with
the
politics

of
monopoly
capitalism
its
central
offices
are
generally
located
in
particular
countries
britain
holland
france
germany
where
big
business
enterprises
had
their
beginnings
and
from
which
representatives
of
oil

enterprises
spilled
over
into
the
territory
of
their
competitors
as
well
as
into
the
third
world
of
erstwhile
colonies
and
other
dependencies
monopoly
capitalism
has
made
no
real
effort
to
organize
a
functioning
world
economy
on
the
contrary
it
has
established
maintained
and
consolidated
centers
of
economic
interests
and
activities
at
the
national
level
in
theory
and
in
practice
the
planet
is
divided
into
economic

political
states

spheres
of

each
equipped
with
the
separatist
institutions
of
political
sovereignty
politically
the
task
of
setting
up
a
competent

government
has
not
been
seriously
taken
in
hand
the
same
may
be
said
for
the
organization
of
a
planned
organized
supervised
planetary
economy
so
far
as
we
know
such
world
economic
institutions
and
practices
can
not
exist
in
the
chaos
of
one
hundred
forty
sovereign
states
each
exercising
authority
over
its

each
with
its

for

economic
practice
throughout
the

with

building

and
sporadic
efforts
at
world
conquest
occupation
and

have
crossed
national
boundary
lines
as
a
matter
of
necessity
it
could
not
be
otherwise
because
no
nation
has
been
able
to
reach
the
cultural
level
of
civilization
on
a
basis
of
economic
primitive
agriculture
can
maintain
a
high
degree
of

city

the

of

occupation

of
foreign

and

at

as
western

has
matured

have
come
more

more
to
the
fore
until
in
the
era
of

capitalism
they
dominate
the
field
in
this
period
of
human
history
nothing
less
than
the
just
sharing
of

will
implement
the
principle
of

monopoly
capitalism
throughout

has
tended
to
function

trade
has
been
carried
on

not

has
the

the

has
used

to
protect

in

one
of
the
most
spectacular
aspects
of
european
expansion
during
modern

has
been
the
growth
of

the
rapid

were
made
by

to

these
examples
illustrate
the
of
an
extensive
international
relationship
that
has
been
an
integral
aspect
of
the
world
revolution
throughout
this
experience
two
parallel
forces
have
been
at
work
one
was
the
effort
to
establish
a
stable
renewable
and
social

the
other
was
the
effort
to
adapt

remake
man
human
nature
to
fit
into
the
rapidly
changing
social

to
expand
and
deepen

with

sociology
the
science
and
art
of
staying
together
in
more

thus
becomes
the

of
association
politics

specialized

economic

are
brought

held
together
by
various
means
among
which
communication
is
outstanding
at

from

and
in
every
aspect
of
politics

other
forms
of

human

one
function
of

the
establishment

of
a

the

been
extensively
developed

the

so
extensively
that
the

for

that
produce
more
or

communication
in
the
provides
an
example
of
the
transformation
from
economic
localism
to
economic
worldism
during
recent
times
by
its
very
nature
communication
tends
to
involve
all

in

ignoring

jostling

annoying
and
even

this
is
a
roundabout
way
of
saying
that

human

and
human

are
part

parcel
of
a
total
relationship
which
includes
the

the

and
an
immense
range
of
celestia
which
includes
minute
particles
of
celestial
dust
like

and
majestic
assemblies
of
celestial
notables
like
the
island
universe
of
which
we
are
unnumbered
and
barely
noticed
particles
at
some
point
in
this
vast
assemblage
actually
before
the
assemblage
came
into

there
were
responsible
animating
forces
in

there
was
also
the
responsibility
for
the
use
or
exercise
of
the
operating
forces
we
humans
are
a
product
of
those
forces
we
also
share
in
their
functioning
consequently
we
share
in
the
responsibility
which
is
associated
with
their
exercise
it
is
the
task
of
philosophy
to
designate
the
responsibility
to
describe
it
measure
it
and
perhaps
to
assign
it
at
any
rate
we
find
ourselves
in
a
position
where
certain
things
are
expected
of
us
perhaps
even
required
of
us
as
members
of
the
human
family
of
the
human
family
as
a
functioning
whole
it
is
entirely
possible
that
instead
of
overlooking
ignoring
bickering
quarreling
and
periodically
maiming
and
killing
each
other
wholesale
we
humans
should
be
devoting
our
energies
emotions
thoughts
and
plans
to
furthering
the
larger
purpose
of
which
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
are
small
segments
in
a
word
that
we
humans
should
be
acting
as
a
responsible
part
of
a
functioning
whole
engaged
in
the
vast
enterprise
of
being

becoming
whatever
our
ultimate
tasks
may
be
our
immediate
problem
is
to
make
the

the
fittest
possible
living

for
all
of

to
organize

in
the
way
best
calculated

to

our

the

place
for
of

in
a
way
that
is
a

will
take
us
into

of
the

field
and
every

in

of

or
are
clinging
parasitically
to
life
after
their

have
been
fulfilled
or
as
their
usefulness
is
drawing
to
a
close
in
a
broad
sense
that
which
lives
on

including

has
a
right
or
an
opportunity
to
be
here
living
to
the
utmost
of
its

capacity
how

limited

of

in

life
on

each

and
all

is
a

opportunity
doubtless
there
are

arbitrators
whose
task
it
is
to
decide
at
any
particular
moment
who
shall
survive

who

perform

in

this

in

we
have
all

by

much
depends
upon

whether
the

that
are
carried
into

promote

for

during
early
centuries
in
the
history
of
western
civilization
adventurers
and
prospectors
concentrated
on
the
precious

the
voyagers
and
discoverers
who
sailed
fifteenth
century
seas
were
seeking

of

that

highly
prized

adorning
the

occupations
such
as

cutting
in

all

continuous
countryside
there
was
a
very
little
mining
but
outside
of
the
commercial
towns
and
the
growing
capital
cities
people
made
their
living
by
taking
care
of
domestic
animals
and
tilling
the
soil
between
seed
time
and
harvest
they
tightened
their
belts
and
prayed
the
powers
that

a
bountiful

if
it
came
they
feasted
if
the
crop
failed
they
struggled
to
survive
on
the
narrow
margin
between
hunger
and
starvation
if
they
saw
any
money
it
was
likely
to
be
copper
with
perhaps
an
occasional
piece
of
silver
gold
was
for
the
rich

at
that
period
there
were

these

sound
strange

romantic
to
the

they
were
the

of

when

were
in

what
has
made
the

ours
chiefly
the
newly

the

but
to

it
is
a
source
of
pride
to

for

that

well
organized
through
successive

have
spent

too
much
time
and
energy
in
destroying
the

come
when
they
must

if
the

now
going

could
be
directed
to

chapter
seventeen
revamping
the
social
life
of
the
planet
beyond
civilization
we
could
develop
a
cluster
of
associations
institutions
outlooks
purposes
and
practices
designed
to
revamp
the
social
life
of
the
planet
in
much
the
same
way
and
with
the
same
general
outlook
with
which
we
approach
the
political
economic
sociological
and
ideological
problems
arising
from
the
presence
on
the
planet
earth
of
some
million
different
human
beings
there
are
at
least
two
approaches
to
the
sociological
aspects
of
our
coordinated
society
one
way
is
that
with
which
cyclism
has
made
us
familiar
the
day
of
manifestation
activity
and
the
night
of
rest
recuperation
restoration
and
renewal
this
might
be
described
as
a
natural
gradual
evolutionary
way
the
other
way
is
based
on
creative
intervention
which
shortcuts
evolutionary
gradualism
in
the
same
way
that
a
great
leap
shortcuts
many
ordinary
steps
perhaps
the
conception
can
be
illustrated
in
a
most
effective
way
by
the
alternative
presented
during
the
great
revolution
of
at
the
beginning
of
this
epoch
man
walked
the
earth
literally
except
when
he
sailed
on
the
water
or
used
the
horse
or
some
other
swift
animal
to
travel
by
land
in
the
course
of
the
great
revolution
mankind
has
learned
to
move
his
body
at
speeds
which
sometimes
exceed
the
movement
of
sound
on
the
land
on
the
water
through
the
air
and
into
space
he
has
done
this
by
revolutionary
changes
in
types
of
energy
coming
from
outside
his
physical
body
in
another
sphere
communication
devices
man
has
stepped
up
the
movement
of
his
emotions
and
thoughts
and
his
creative
imagination
beyond
the
speed
of
light
this
analogy
is
not
complete
nor
is
it
wholly
convincing
but
the
great
revolution
in
science
and
technology
applied
in
the
field
of
social
science
can
quite
conceivably
provide
humanity
with
the
means
of
the
normal
or
natural
processes
in
sociology
as
it
has
already
the
normal
or
natural
process
in
human
transportation
and
communication
as
long
as
human
beings
accept
the
normal
traditional
natural
principles
of
association
and
group
action
humanity
will
continue
on
the
of
civilization
with
its
long
established
cycles
of
beginning
expansion
exploitation
maturity
conflict
decline
and
extermination
this
aspect
of
planetary
sociology
may
be
illustrated
by
the
rise
and
decline
of
total
membership
in
the
human
family
we
know
that
roman
civilization
passed
through
a
completed
cycle
of
population
expansion
to
an
optimum
followed
by
a
catastrophic
population
decline
western
civilization
has
been
experiencing
a
population
expansion
or
explosion
that
can
be
measured
with
a
moderate
degree
of
statistical
accuracy
planetary
human
population
doubled
from
million
in
to
million
in
between
and
population
more
than
doubled
from
million
to
million
in
the
human
population
of
the
earth
is
close
to
million
an
essential
aspect
of
world
government
will
be
a
population
program
designed
to
adjust
social
structure
and
planning
to
the
means
of
production
and
to
make
generally
available
to
all
humans
and
where
possible
all
living
things
the
results
of
invention
discovery
and
experience
with
affluence
general
security
and
wide
variations
of
vocational
and
avocational
choice
in
practice
such
a
program
would
include
the
planned
utilization
and
conservation
of
nature
and
the
conscious
improvement
of
society
by
society
social
planning
at
the
planetary
level
could
deal
chiefly
with
large
national
or
regional
groupings
more
or
less
divergent
in
viewpoint
but
conscious
of
the
necessity
for
bringing
local
and
regional
groups
together
in
order
to
secure
common
agreement
and
to
take
part
in
directed
joint
actions
such
efforts
must
aim
at
sufficient
cohesion
to
provide
for
normal
social
function
at
all
levels
sufficient
permissiveness
to
allow
for
a
measure
of
at
all
levels
sufficient
authority
to
carry
on
production
and
distribution
at
all
levels
and
sufficient
libertarianism
to
tolerate
discussion
and
opposition
at
all
levels
with
a
maximum
degree
of
self
sufficiency
and
at
all
levels
nowhere
is
the
need
for
social
planning
more
in
evidence
than
in
the
sphere
of
human
population
in
the
early
years
of
the
present
twentieth
century
the
human
population
was
doubling
in
about
years
from
million
in
to
million
in
from
million
in
to
million
in
had
this
rate
of
growth
continued
for
another
hundred
years
the
planet
fertile
acres
would
have
been
fully
occupied
by
jostling
crowds
with
signs
in
the
more
desirable
living
spaces
japan
the
united
states
several
countries
of
west
europe
and
china
have
launched
campaigns
to
reduce
net
population
increase
to
one
percent
per
year
or
less
a
culture
level
to
be
effective
in
the
present
predicament
of
a
human
race
oscillating
uneasily
between
the
possibility
of
social
advance
and
the
probability
of
recession
into
another
dark
age
of
ignorance
superstition
and
social
stagnation
must
include
certain
essential
elements
first
and
foremost
it
must
be
given
planetary
unification
by
communication
transportation
travel
migration
trade
and
commerce
and
cultural
interchange
one
world
has
become
a
factual
reality
world
oneness
is
laced
by
contradictions
confrontations
conflicts
by
traditional
customary
habitual
ideological
legal
and
national
barriers
of
greater
or
lesser
rigidity
despite
these
divisive
forces
our
need
to
function
in
terms
of
planetary
oneness
is
so
great
that
the
term
citizens
of
the
world
not
only
makes
sense
but
is
accepted
and
even
flaunted
in
the
face
of
tough
restrictions
and
hard
nosed
nationalism
segments
of
humanity
that
are
ready
and
willing
to
sign
up
as
world
citizens
already
enjoy
world
consciousness
carrying
world
passports
and
are
experimenting
with
various
aspects
of
worldist
thinking
contact
organization
they
are
ready
and
willing
to
take
part
in
a
multitude
of
planetary
experiments
in
human
association
the
great
revolution
of
has
made
two
notable
contributions
to
the
institutions
of
western
civilization
in
the
field
of
politics
it
has
contributed
the
nation
state
in
the
field
of
economics
it
has
contributed
industrialization
with
its
twin
sociological
consequence
mechanization
and
urbanization
machines
and
cities
are
the
siamese
twins
of
the
modern
age
they
are
also
the
twin
forces
that
helped
to
push
the
nation
state
into
its
strategic
position
of
sovereign
independence
nationalism
today
is
a
unifying
force
inside
the
frontiers
of
the
nations
that
presently
litter
and
clutter
the
earth
beyond
each
frontier
however
nationalism
has
become
one
of
the
most
divisive
sources
of
misunderstanding
controversy
disruption
and
conflict
presently
cursing
mankind
in
the
exercise
of
their
sovereignty
the
oligarchs
who
make
policy
and
direct
procedure
in
each
sovereign
state
put
national
interests
first
on
a
planet
which
currently
hosts
sovereign
states
this
policy
of
putting
the
interests
of
the
part
before
the
interests
of
the
whole
results
in
controversy
conflict
and
may
result
in
collective
it
is
reassuring
and
encouraging
to
compare
the
rise
of
nationalism
and
europeanism
during
the
past
thousand
years
with
the
rise
of
planetism
and
worldism
from
to
the
development
of
nationalism
and
europeanism
is
still
incomplete
but
the
drive
in
that
direction
has
thus
far
survived
the
fragmenting
forces
of
and
political
independence
which
have
played
so
vital
a
role
in
human
society
since
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
europeanization
is
still
a
dream
rather
than
a
reality
the
forces
of
regionalism
nationalism
and
separatism
still
dominate
european
life
but
the
ideology
and
techniques
of
europeanization
are
widely
recognized
accepted
and
put
into
practice
the
development
of
worldism
seems
to
be
following

wisdom
foresight
and
the
acceptance
of

as

in

seem
to
justify
our
assumption
that
sooner

later
man
survival
on
the

will
depend
on
a
degree
of
worldist
thinking
association
and
institutionalism
that
will
guarantee
the
preservation
of
order
and
decency
at
the
planetary
level
since
conformity
implies
and
involves
a
will
to
diversity
measures
to
establish

maintain

would
include
the

possible
latitude
and
the

effort
to
encourage
the

possible

at

thus

would
become
a

in

the

sense
that

became
a
virtue
in

in

during

adopting
a
permissiveness
under
which
the
sky
is
the
limit
in
language
clothing
sexual
conduct
and
professional
choice
and
behavior
is
all
very
well
as
protest
against

it
fails
utterly
to
meet
the
basic
need
of
the
for
a
mass
movement
away
from
the
institutions
and

of
civilization
plus
a
disciplined
and
purposive
mass
determination
to
assume
attitudes
adopt

establish

leading
beyond

to
a

culture
pattern
which
insists
upon

up

beyond
that
point
a

including
recognized

organized
opposition
at
the

at
the

there
must
be
a
degree
of

that

regional

with

arising
out

to

step
revise
the

charter
to
make

also
citizens
of

therefore
under

the

so
adopted
would

inaugurate

promoting

stability
justice
equality
of

and
general

at

heretofore
the
nearest
approach
to
a

has
been
an
empire
like

built
by

and
maintained
by
military
authority
exercised
by
the
imperial
nucleus
over
its
associated
and
subordinated
territories
the
universal
state
described
above
would
be
an
association
of
sovereign
states
each
delegating
a
sufficient
measure
of
its
sovereignty
to
enable
the
world
federation
to
act
as
a

we

the
result

when

the

the
current
shift
from

letting

take

course
to
a

is
a
precedent

the

our
future
for
generations
to
come
may
be
determined
by
the
decisions
we
are
making
or
the
social
policy
we
are
initiating
at
the
present
moment
large
scale
research
and
experiment
should
go
a
long
way
toward
developing
the
skills
required
by
competent
and
successful
planetary
leadership
political
experiments
like
the
united
states
of
north
america
or
the
union
of
socialist
soviet
republics
or
the
league
of
nations
or
the
united
nations
the
search
for
petroleum
or
the
joint
scientific
efforts
that
went
into
the
splitting
of
the
atom
have
given
us
opportunities
to
develop
the
science
and
art
of
leadership
behind
and
beyond
our
training
courses
our
formal
educational
system
which
should
be
in
the
front
rank
of
our
priorities
we
could
train
apprentices
in
every
occupational
field
selecting
the
most
apt
the
most
eager
the
seemingly
best
qualified
and
giving
them
every
opportunity
to
try
out
their
skills
and
improve
their
qualifications
in
their
chosen
fields
of
endeavor
aspirants
for
any
occupational
assignment
would
divide
themselves
into
three
groups
those
who
feel
that
they
have
chosen
wisely
find
themselves
in
congenial
surrounds
and
want
to
spend
coming
years
in
the
occupation
of
their
choice
those
who
are
uncertain
and
still
unable
to
decide
upon
the
field
of
their
life
activity
and
third
those
who
have
chosen
badly
are
dissatisfied
with
the
occupational
groove
in
which
they
find
themselves
and
who
are
ready
to
move
into
another
field
at
the
first
opportunity
the
well
adjusted
will
constitute
the
elite
of
their
chosen
occupations
learning
its
skills
and
joining
with
other
well
satisfied
professionals
in
passing
on
their
enthusiasm
and
knowledge
to
the
next
generation
of
aspirants
for
inclusion
in
the
same
production
teams
the
undecided
should
be
the
object
of
special
attention
they
have
entered
an
occupational
field
on
an
experimental
basis
and
should
be
advised
and
helped
during
the
experimental
period
when
they
are
deciding
to
make
a
go
of
it
or
to
try
for
something
more
congenial
or
at
least
more
acceptable
misfits
who
have
made
a
wrong
choice
and
who
have
no
clear
call
to
stay
where
they
are
should
be
advised
and
helped
to
find
more
congenial
occupational
surroundings
we
may
think
and
experiment
with
this
selective
process
as
though
it
was
easy
and
probably
final
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
reality
even
the
best
adjusted
have
moments
of
uncertainty
and
indecision
about
their
occupational
futures
the
less
adjusted
spend
a
part
of
their
lives
looking
around
for
a
more
attractive
field
in
every
field
some
of
the
best
adjusted
go
as
far
as
their
interests
and
capacities
carry
them
and
then
shift
over
into
other
occupations
which
in
turn
offer
them
more
chances
to
employ
their
talents
to
greater
advantage
in
every
field
of
human
endeavor
individuals
come
and
go
they
should
stay
where
they
seem
to
be
useful
and
go
when
their
usefulness
is
decreasing
or
coming
to
an
end
balance
between
status
and
change
is
as
desirable
for
the
individual
as
it
is
for
the
group
the
decision
to
stay
or
go
should
remain
open
to
the
endless
round
of
individuals
who
comprise
any
working
team
the
existence
of
such
flexibility
is
limited
however
by
the
need
to
maintain
a
working
force
of
interested
alert
eager
individuals
skilled
adjusted
and
disciplined
in
group
endeavor
and
achievement
we
are
describing
the
unending
process
of
selection
which
goes
on
from
hour
to
hour
and
day
to
day
in
any
well
ordered
social
group
every
group
has
its
fields
of
endeavor
its
goals
and
its
scale
of
priorities
individuals
come
and
go
the
group
carries
on
excellence
in
group
performance
depends
upon
its
competence
in
selecting
training
and
coordinating
its
endeavors
every
social
group
has
its
hard
corps
of
trained
and
tested
veterans
also
it
has
its
problem
of
aging
the
apprentice
of
yesterday
becomes
the
experienced
skilled
operator
of
today
tomorrow
brings
retirement
for
those
who
have
reached
the
age
limit
of
service
and
who
as
a
matter
of
group
routine
are
replaced
by
newcomers
in
the
course
of
this
cycle
the
directors
of
the
group
have
their
opportunity
to
improve
the
level
of
group
efficiency
by
phasing
out
the
old
and
incorporating
the
new

as
it

for

the
tone
and
performance
level
of
each

is
determined
by
the
effectiveness
of
this
selective
process
at
some
point
it
becomes
necessary
to
inquire
into
the
biologic
aspects
of
any
social

are

select

we
may
have
a
workable
system
of
social
priorities
but
does
our
oncoming
stream
of
manpower
have
the
interest
the
imagination
the
competence
the
sense
of
social
responsibility
and
the
staying
power
necessary
to
arouse
in
a

of

the

and
determination
to
carry

the

we

as
we
have
developed
a
corps
of
competent
scientists
and
technicians
in
the
field
of
natural
science
in
each
field
priorities
are
constantly
changing
each
field
is
called
upon
to
meet
the
changes
by
making
corresponding
changes
in
its
personnel
its
education
and
its
apprenticeships
in
addition
to
formal
schooling
and
apprenticeship
we
have
a
vast
network
for
the

of

and
the
formation
of

answers
to

periodic
housecleaning

its
quota
of
defectives

biological
and
social

here
the
critical
problem
is
where
to
draw
the
line
perhaps
the
best
general
answer
is
to
measure
productiveness
including
those
who
make
a
net
contribution
including
those
whose
presence
is
desirable
and
excluding
undesirables

periodic
housecleanings
throughout

mankind
has
been
confronted
by
an
many

development
the

of
as

the

one
in

our

instead

man
could
break
out
of
the
prison

of

humans
have
been
living
for
ages
with
various

as
hunters

as

on
the
whole
our
energies
have
been
spent
in
relatively
small
groups
staying
close
to
nature
as
a
part
of
nature
occasionally
we
have
turned
from
this
natural
way
of

to
build
towns

cities
experimenting
with
large

mass
enterprises
and
expanded

of

to
which
we

in

our
variant

western

has
been
passing
through
the
customary
life
cycle
if
we
read
the

western
civilization
reached
the
high
point
in
its
cycle
toward
the
end
of
the
last
century
since
then
for
years
it
has
been
on
the
decline
if
we
accept
the
cycle
of
civilization
as
one
of
the
facts
or
sequences
presented
to
us
by
history
we
may
continue
to
pass
submissively
through
the
successive
stages
of
decline
until
western
civilization
is
liquidated
by
the
same
forces
that
wiped
out

this
would

the

the

that

in

on
the

presently

in

we
listed
a
number
of
discoveries

which
have
greatly
increased

over
his

as
these

are
embodied

can
deal
with
the

almost
as
comprehensibly
as
they
now
deal
with
the
past
those
who
take
this
position
argue
that
humanity
has
reached
a
point
at
which
it
may
break
out
of
the
present
cycle
of

begin
a

be

in

parts
of
the
existing
society
they
live
their
lives
apart
from
the
main
currents
of
human
life
we
may
make
the
same
comment
with
slight
modifications
on
intentional
communities
organized
within
the
bounds
of
surrounding
civilizations
they
meet
the
needs
of

who
find

theories

are

two

organized
around
ethical
or
social
principles
are
more
enduring

through

sometimes
through
centuries
during
their
existence
they
may
have
considerable
influence
on
the

which
they
are

at
best
they
parallel
the
life
of
the
civilization
against
which
they
protest
while
they
share
its
problems
religiously
oriented
intentional
communities
may
be
found
today
in
many
of
the
countries
composing
western
civilization
what
concerns
us
here
is
the
split
of
western
civilization
into
two
broadly
divergent
groups
capitalism
and
capitalism
in
its
present
monopoly
form
is
the
outcome

vehicle
of
competition
has
become
the
business
corporation
backed
politically
and
often
subsidized
economically
by
the
nation
or
empire
as
western
civilization
has
developed
nations
and
empires
have
tended
to
form
more
or
less
permanent
alliances
business
corporations
likewise
have
tended
to
establish
conglomerates
which
include
widely
divergent
businesses
some
limited

one
nation
or
empire
some
international
historically
the
business
community
developed
out
of
a
segmented
european
feudal
society
as
a
protest
against
political
restrictions
its
early
was
freedom
of
businessmen
to
make
economic
policy
and
accumulate
profits
the
practical
outcome
of
economy
has
been
monopoly
or
finance
capitalism
functioning
through
the
sovereign
state
or
empire
marxian
organized
and
developed
largely
since
has
grown
up
as
a
rebellion
against
monopoly
capitalism
at
it
matured
after
revolutions
in
mexico
china
tsarist
russia
and
east
europe
it
became
an
alternative
and
even
a
competitive
life
style
marxism
has
been
at
least
in
theory
cooperative
rather
than
competitive
its
objective
has
been
not
private
profit
but
a
higher
standard
of
economic
and
social
life
for
exploited
masses
of
the
business
community
and
of
the
third
world
capitalism
has
had
as
its
slogan
every
man
for
himself
the
slogan
of
marxism
is
serve
the
whole
people
until
marxism
was
a
body
of
social
theory
and
a
program
of
specific
political
demands
in
the
period
from
to
marxism
operated
through
minority
political
parties
organized
in
each
nation
but
linked
together
internationally
in
loose
federations
except
during
the
brief
existence
of
the
communist
international
from
to
beginning
with
the
russian
revolution
of
marxism
became
a
basic
state
doctrine
first
in
the
soviet
union
and
subsequently
in
more
than
a
dozen
other
nations
of
east
europe
and
asia
the
area
of
marxist
influence
as
expressed
in
socialist
construction
spread
slowly
from
to
and
rapidly
during
and
immediately
after
the
war
of
today
about
a
billion
human
beings
live
in
countries
of
east
europe
and
asia
calling
themselves
a
second
billion
human
beings
live
chiefly
in
west
europe
the
americas
and
australasia
calling
themselves
capitalist
a
third
billion
the
remaining
segment
of
mankind
living
chiefly
in
africa
asia
and
latin
america
make
up
the
third
world
most
of
which
consists
of
former
colonies
and
dependencies
of
the
century
empires
at
the
beginning
of
the
great
revolution
in
the
planet
was
occupied
by
the
european
empires
their
colonies
and
dependencies
with
a
segment
under
the
control
of
the
crumbling
chinese
and
turkish
empires
the
ensuing
two
centuries
witnessed
a
political
economic
and
social
transformation
that
reached
across
every
continent
the
revolutionary
process
is
far
from
complete
in
capitalism
and
marxism
are
still
pitted
against
each
other
ideologically
politically
culturally
the
marxians
form
a
revolutionary
front
capitalists
retort
with
nation
by
nation
the
third
world
is
taking
sides
the
capitalist
world
is
suffering
from
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
business
cycle
from
inflation
and
unemployment
from
the
scourge
of
militarism
from
the
exhaustion
of
two
general
wars
in
one
generation
from
absence
of
any
positive
common
program
or
commonly
accepted
means
of
administering
public
affairs
from
its
failure
to
provide
its
young
people
with
a
satisfactory
reason
for
existence
and
from
the
fatal
malady
of
fragmentation
which
is
the
logical
counterpart
of
every
major
effort
at
coordination
consolidation
and
unification
western
civilization
despite
repeated
efforts
was
never
able
to
establish
the
kind
of
superficial
unity
that
marked
the
high
point
in
the
egyptian
and
roman
civilizations
the
stresses
and
strains
of
the
current
great
revolution
have
introduced
into
western
civilization
new
disintegrative
forces
of
which
the
confrontation
is
the
most
extensive
divisive
and
decisive
the
marxist
world
in
its
spectacular
rise
during
less
than
a
century
offers
the
only
workable
alternative
to
declining
and
disintegrating
western
civilization
it
presents
an
alternative
theoretical
program
for
dealing
with
the
transition
from
the
competitiveness
of
western
civilization
to
the
cooperativeness
of
a
planned
coordinated
federated
world
order
the
soviet
union
and
its
east
european
socialist
neighbors
have
survived
the
wars
of
and
have
survived
the
capitalist
conspiracy
to
strangle
infant
marxism
in
its
cradle
in
a
remarkably
brief
period
the
soviet
union
has
moved
from
a
position
of
cultural
backwardness
to
become
the
number
two
nation
in
productivity
and
perhaps
even
number
one
in
fire
power
today
asia
active
development
of
several
variants
of
marxism
is
defended
against
any
repetition
of
hitler
drive
to
the
east
by
the
massive
land
barrier
of
the
soviet
union
and
its
east
european
marxist
associates
on
the
west
asia
is
protected
by
the
vast
expanses
of
the
pacific
ocean
against
the
determined
efforts
of
the
washington
government
to
check
the
spread
of
marxism
washington
current
effort
to
become
pacific
power
and
also
asian
power
have
been
blocked
and
perhaps
thwarted
by
the
defeat
of
general
macarthur
and
his
international
forces
in
the
korean
war
of
and
by
the
unanticipated
and
unbelievable
resistance
mounted
by
the
peoples
of
south
east
asia
against
the
repeated
efforts
made
by
washington
to
replace
the
french
imperial
presence
there
after
its
overwhelming
defeat
in
the
decisive
political
developments
in
south
and
east
asia
following
war
end
in
were
first
the
expulsion
of
the
british
french
and
dutch
from
their
military
strongholds
in
the
area
second
the
spectacular
unification
of
china
and
its
rapid
advance
from
inferiority
and
political
inconsequence
to
a
place
among
the
three
major
world
powers
third
the
meteoric
comeback
of
japan
after
its
unconditional
surrender
in
and
fourth
the
failure
of
the
costly
effort
mounted
by
washington
after
to
establish
itself
in
a
position
from
which
it
could
dominate
the
pacific
ocean
and
east
asia
so
much
we
may
learn
from
history
turning
from
the
past
and
looking
at
the
trends
of
the
immediate
future
it
seems
likely
that
marxism
will
continue
for
at
least
some
years
to
be
the
dominant
force
in
asia
furthermore
the
marxian
presence
in
asia
will
include
both
the
soviet
union
in
northern
asia
and
china
in
south
asia
both
countries
are
unquestionably
stabilized
economically
and
viable
politically
both
are
headed
away
from
capitalist
imperialism
both
are
moving
toward
marxian
forms
of
the
wars
in
south
east
asia
after
the
expulsion
of
the
french
in
were
organized
financed
and
armed
primarily
by
the
washington
government
they
were
avowedly
aimed
at
the
of
marxism
from
the
area
they
not
only
failed
in
their
main
objective
but
they
gave
the
soviet
union
and
the
chinese
a
chance
to
pit
their
advisers
technicians
and
military
equipment
against
that
of
the
united
states
as
the
major
capitalist
contender
in
the
area
this
phase
of
the
drive
to
reestablish
monopoly
capitalism
and
imperialism
in
the
far
east
thus
far
has
met
with
decisive
and
humiliating
defeat
this
defeat
marks
the
end
of
the
capitalist
occupation
of
far
asia
it
also
opens
the
way
for
the
marxists
to
demonstrate
the
workability
of
as
a
lifestyle
for
asians
and
presumably
for
other
segments
of
the
third
world
success
of
the
marxists
in
maintaining
and
extending
their
presence
in
asia
will
make
it
politically
and
culturally
possible
for
them
to
take
five
essential
steps
to
extend
the
developing
pattern
of
collective
responsibility
and
collective
action
around
the
earth
as
rapidly
as
possible
if
such
an
extension
proves
feasible
it
should
give
marxism
a
real
priority
in
stabilizing
the
economy
and
building
up
the
political
vigor
of
the
far
east
organized
could
be
liquidated
and
revolutionaries
willing
to
take
on
the
responsibility
could
be
provided
with
necessary
authority
leadership
and
equipment
moving
along
with
the
formulation
and
fulfillment
of
carefully
developed
plans
for
socialist
construction
in
all
of
its
ramifications
to
close
the
door
gradually
step
by
considered
step
on
exploitation
and
profiteering
in
their
places
plans
could
be
drawn
up
for
developing
a
people
economy
in
the
more
backward
areas
of
africa
asia
and
the
americas
the
new
economy
could
be
federated
as
it
was
established
and
stabilized
with
special
attention
to
the
need
for
a
maximum
of
local
self
help
to
balance
against
pressures
toward
bureaucracy
and
the
development
of
overhead
costs
with
one
eye
on
its
need
for
integration
into
a
collective
planetary
economy
the
other
eye
must
be
kept
on
the
planetary
chain
of
which
the
earth
is
an
essential
part
life
is
a
process
operating
through
the
linking
of
causes
and
their
effects
this
is
as
true
of
social
life
as
it
is
of
individual
life
reviewing
history
we
check
man
past
actions
and
learn
by
so
doing
turning
to
the
future
we
plan
and
prepare
to
set
in
motion
that
conglomerate
of
causes

calculated
to
assure
a
good

individually
socially

imposed

by
