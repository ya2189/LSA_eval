the
ringgold
archers
a
reminiscence
by
frank
stockton
when
i
was
a
boy
i
belonged
to
a
small
company
of
young
fellows
all
under
fourteen
who
had
banded
themselves
together
for
the
purpose
of
practising
archery
our
company
owed
its
name
to
our
great
admiration
for
major
ringgold
about
whose
valiant
exploits
in
the
mexican
war
we
had
often
read
and
talked
he
was
a
romantic
man
and
romance
always
has
a
charm
for
the
young
even
when
they
do
not
understand
it
the
major
was
a
brave
cavalryman
and
we
had
seen
pictures
of
him
charging
at
the
head
of
his
horsemen
with
his
long
hair
floating
in
the
wind
in
this
long
hair
lay
his
romance
for
we
had
heard
the
story
that
having
been
crossed
in
love
he
vowed
he
would
never
again
cut
his
hair
the
point
of
this
resolution
we
did
not
then
understand
nor
can
i
say
that
i
fully
comprehend
it
now
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
each
one
of
us
would
have
been
perfectly
willing
to
be
crossed
in
love
if
the
result
should
be
that
we
would
charge
at
the
head
of
some
brave
cavalrymen
with
our
sword
drawn
and
our
long
hair
floating
in
the
breeze
when
we
had
decided
upon
the
name
of
our
company
and
had
elected
officers
we
considered
that
the
next
most
important
thing
was
to
provide
ourselves
with
a
uniform
dress
this
subject
did
not
occasion
very
much
discussion
the
color
for
an
archer
could
be
nothing
else
than
green
and
as
to
the
cut
and
general
of
the
dress
it
would
have
to
be
very
simple
for
none
of
us
were
able
to
afford
an
elaborate
uniform
so
it
was
decided
that
a
blouse
long
enough
to
cover
our
ordinary
coats
and
fasten
around
the
waist
with
a
belt
would
be
quite
sufficient
as
to
our
we
all
wore
straw
hats
and
if
we
chose
to
put
feathers
in
them
we
could
do
so
but
this
was
left
for
future
consideration
the
material
of
our
uniform
was
determined
by
the
state
of
our
finances
when
each
one
of
us
had
put
into
the
treasury
all
the
money
he
could
afford
it
was
plain
to
see
that
our
blouses
must
be
made
of
some
cheap
stuff
one
of
our
members
had
some
family
connection
with
the
business
and
he
informed
us
that
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
buy
a
whole
piece
of
goods
for
in
that
way
we
could
get
it
cheaper
and
he
was
sure
that
our
money
would
be
sufficient
to
buy
a
piece
of
cotton
cloth
good
enough
for
our
purposes
it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
of
a
summer
day
that
the
meeting
was
held
at
which
the
matter
of
the
uniform
was
decided
upon
and
as
it
was
still
light
we
thought
it
well
to
go
immediately
and
buy
our
material
if
we
delayed
something
might
happen
to
our
money
therefore
in
a
body
we
repaired
to
a
store
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
found
a
piece
of
goods
which
we
thought
would
suit
us
it
was
a
little
glittering
upon
one
side
and
it
was
rather
stiffer
than
we
thought
an
archer
dress
should
be
but
if
we
made
our
blouses
with
the
wrong
side
of
the
material
out
they
would
look
well
enough
and
we
had
no
doubt
that
the
stiffness
would
come
out
after
we
had
worn
them
for
a
time
especially
if
we
were
obliged
to
encounter
storms
which
true
archers
should
never
fear
triumphantly
we
carried
our
piece
of
goods
to
the
house
of
one
of
the
members
and
having
found
out
how
much
of
the
material
would
be
necessary
to
make
a
blouse
we
cut
it
up
into
suitable
portions
one
of
which
was
given
to
each
member
and
he
was
expected
to
take
it
home
and
have
some
one
of
his
family
cut
it
out
and
make
it
for
him
there
was
a
very
early
meeting
the
next
morning
at
the
house
of
our
captain
and
every
boy
brought
with
him
his
allotted
portion
of
goods
we
were
all
horrified
the
stuff
was
blue
and
not
green
the
gas
had
been
lighted
in
the
store
when
we
bought
it
and
instead
of
robin
hood
green
we
had
picked
out
a
piece
of
bright
blue
material
this
mistake
would
have
been
a
matter
of
no
importance
had
we
not
been
in
such
haste
to
divide
the
stuff
among
the
members
if
the
piece
had
been
left
entire
we
could
have
easily
exchanged
it
but
now
this
was
impossible
we
had
a
long
meeting
and
much
discussion
but
as
we
had
bought
our
material
and
as
we
had
no
money
to
buy
more
we
at
last
regretfully
concluded
that
the
best
thing
we
could
do
would
be
to
make
up
our
blouses
of
the
blue
and
try
to
forget
that
they
ought
to
be
green
vacation
was
passing
and
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
if
we
expected
to
make
a
successful
summer
campaign
and
our
uniforms
were
immediately
put
into
the
hands
of
our
mothers
sisters
and
aunts
in
most
cases
there
was
but
little
trouble
in
inducing
these
good
relatives
to
make
the
blouses
although
i
think
we
were
all
of
us
told
that
it
would
have
been
a
great
deal
better
if
we
had
asked
some
lady
to
buy
our
goods
for
us
but
as
this
would
have
deprived
us
of
a
great
and
independent
pleasure
it
should
hardly
have
been
expected
there
was
an
exception
however
to
the
ready
consent
of
our
families
to
do
our
the
mother
of
one
of
our
members
objected
to
her
son
wearing
a
uniform
of
any
sort
and
although
she
did
not
actually
forbid
his
doing
so
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
fabrication
of
it
therefore
it
was
that
the
poor
boy
in
the
seclusion
of
his
chamber
set
to
work
to
make
it
himself
some
of
us
found
him
at
this
work
just
as
he
was
about
to
cut
it
out
we
took
it
from
him
and
one
of
us
carried
it
home
where
it
was
properly
made
while
work
was
going
on
upon
our
uniforms
we
thought
it
well
to
attend
to
the
armament
of
our
company
and
those
who
did
not
possess
bows
and
arrows
were
ordered
to
get
them
as
soon
as
possible
no
matter
what
family
assessments
might
be
necessary
our
archery
weapons
were
not
of
a
fancy
sort
we
had
no
bows
of
yew
nor
arrows
pointed
with
steel
and
tipped
with
fine
feathers
but
we
had
good
bows
made
by
a
cooper
of
our
acquaintance
and
our
arrows
often
sped
well
to
the
mark
although
they
did
not
stick
there
we
had
discussed
the
propriety
of
inserting
pieces
of
sharpened
iron
into
the
heads
of
these
arrows
but
this
improvement
having
been
made
known
to
some
of
our
parents
had
been
strictly
forbidden
as
soon
as
our
garments
were
finished
we
held
a
full
meeting
in
which
we
all
appeared
in
our
new
uniforms
and
to
say
that
the
result
was
satisfactory
would
be
to
make
a
misstatement
in
the
city
in
which
we
lived
there
was
a
great
deal
of
charcoal
used
and
this
fuel
was
carried
about
the
streets
in
wagons
with
high
sides
each
accompanied
by
two
men
one
of
whom
marched
in
front
ringing
a
bell
and
crying
charcoal
while
the
other
attended
to
the
horse
and
shovelled
out
the
charcoal
whenever
a
purchaser
hailed
him
from
a
house
these
men
invariably
dressed
in
long
blue
gowns
and
when
we
were
gathered
together
attired
in
our
uniforms
there
was
not
one
of
us
who
was
not
immediately
reminded
of
the
some
were
disgusted
and
some
laughed
but
there
was
no
remedy
there
were
but
two
things
we
could
do
we
must
wear
our
blue
blouses
or
we
must
go
out
on
our
archery
expeditious
in
our
ordinary
clothes
in
the
latter
case
we
would
be
a
mere
party
of
boys
whereas
if
we
marched
forth
in
our
uniforms
no
matter
what
color
they
might
be
we
were
the
ringgold
archers
we
chose
to
stand
by
our
name
our
purpose
and
our
organization
on
the
outskirts
of
our
city
there
were
open
country
woods
and
streams
and
it
was
here
that
we
were
to
begin
our
life
of
merrie
men
under
the
tree
and
our
first
expedition
was
made
without
delay
early
one
afternoon
we
marched
forth
into
the
streets
seven
of
us
each
wearing
his
blue
blouse
his
arrows
stuck
in
his
belt
and
his
unstrung
bow
in
his
hand
we
attracted
a
good
deal
of
attention
there
were
people
who
looked
at
us
and
laughed
there
were
others
who
wondered
and
during
our
march
through
town
we
frequently
met
with
youngsters
who
cried
charcoal
and
then
ran
away
seven
boys
no
matter
how
they
might
be
dressed
were
not
to
be
trifled
with
when
we
reached
the
country
we
had
a
fine
time
the
birds
did
not
laugh
at
us
the
wild
flowers
and
bushes
took
no
notice
of
us
except
when
some
sociable
blackberry
bush
endeavored
to
detain
us
by
seizing
the
skirts
of
our
flowing
robes
and
the
trees
which
we
used
as
targets
did
not
always
refuse
to
be
hit
whether
they
represented
men
or
deer
or
even
an
bear
for
there
were
bold
fellows
in
our
company
with
good
imaginations
but
i
can
not
tell
all
the
bloodless
pleasures
of
our
chase
for
i
must
hasten
to
relate
how
this
first
expedition
of
the
ringgold
archers
was
its
last
toward
the
close
of
the
day
well
satisfied
with
our
afternoon
sport
we
were
returning
along
a
quiet
and
almost
deserted
country
road
when
we
met
two
young
men
these
fellows
when
they
beheld
the
strange
procession
of
boys
appearing
around
a
turn
in
the
road
were
greatly
impressed
and
they
burst
into
the
most
vociferous
laughter
of
course
we
did
not
like
this
and
we
would
have
been
content
to
pass
on
treating
the
disrespectful
fellows
with
silent
contempt
but
this
the
young
men
did
not
permit
they
stopped
us
and
wanted
to
know
why
we
were
dressed
in
these
blue
shirts
and
what
we
intended
to
do
with
our
bows
and
arrows
when
our
organization
and
our
purposes
had
been
explained
they
were
not
satisfied
they
examined
our
arms
and
ridiculed
them
as
they
were
sure
they
would
not
kill
anything
they
laughed
again
at
our
uniform
making
those
allusions
to
charcoal
which
had
become
familiar
to
us
and
in
other
ways
treated
our
band
with
the
discourtesy
which
although
was
extremely
disagreeable
to
us
when
they
had
jeered
at
us
to
their
satisfaction
they
went
their
way
there
were
two
members
of
our
company
whose
proud
souls
could
not
brook
this
treatment
and
they
determined
that
they
would
give
these
impudent
fellows
a
taste
of
their
quality
they
followed
the
young
men
a
little
way
and
then
ran
up
a
low
bank
on
the
side
of
the
road
there
they
fitted
arrows
to
their
bows
and
prepared
to
shoot
at
the
fellows
who
had
insulted
them
as
soon
as
the
rest
of
us
saw
what
our
companions
proposed
to
do
we
hurried
to
them
and
urged
them
to
come
down
and
let
the
young
men
alone
it
would
not
do
to
rouse
the
anger
of
such
fellows
who
looked
as
if
they
might
be
very
rough
customers
if
they
chose
to
be
but
our
bold
companions
were
not
to
be
restrained
their
souls
chafed
under
their
injuries
and
before
we
could
stop
them
each
had
drawn
an
arrow
to
its
head
and
let
it
fly
at
the
young
men
who
were
now
barely
within
range
one
of
the
arrows
struck
its
mark
and
the
other
fell
near
by
instantly
the
enemy
stopped
and
turned
and
beholding
the
two
boys
standing
on
the
bank
with
their
bows
in
their
hands
had
no
reason
to
ask
who
had
shot
at
them
but
instead
of
hurrying
away
to
avoid
another
discharge
of
arrows
from
these
bold
archers
the
young
men
made
use
of
some
very
violent
language
and
without
the
slightest
hesitation
ran
towards
the
two
boys
who
turned
and
fled
across
a
field
the
chase
was
short
for
the
young
men
were
powerful
runners
the
valiant
archers
were
caught
by
the
collars
of
their
blue
uniforms
their
bows
were
wrenched
from
their
hands
and
the
next
moment
each
one
of
them
was
receiving
a
sound
drubbing
with
his
own
weapons
the
arrows
which
they
had
in
their
belts
were
taken
and
broken
and
they
were
told
in
very
strong
language
that
if
they
did
not
get
out
of
sight
as
fast
as
they
could
they
would
have
another
whipping
this
advice
was
taken
and
the
disarmed
archers
fled
all
this
happened
so
quickly
that
the
other
members
of
the
ringgold
archers
had
no
chance
to
do
anything
in
defence
of
their
comrades
even
if
they
had
felt
able
but
now
we
perceived
that
we
must
do
something
to
defend
ourselves
for
the
young
men
still
speaking
angrily
advanced
towards
us
we
stood
our
ground
for
we
had
seen
that
there
was
no
use
in
running
and
besides
why
should
we
run
we
had
done
no
wrong
to
any
one
the
young
men
jumped
down
from
the
bank
and
without
delay
or
explanation
ordered
all
of
us
to
surrender
our
arms
to
this
we
vehemently
objected
we
had
committed
no
offence
towards
them
we
had
even
advised
our
comrades
to
refrain
from
their
attack
and
there
was
no
reason
why
we
should
give
up
our
bows
and
arrows
but
the
young
men
were
in
no
mood
to
consider
reasons
they
seized
our
bows
forced
them
from
our
hands
and
jerked
our
arrows
from
our
belts
i
can
remember
now
how
stoutly
i
held
on
to
my
bow
and
how
soon
i
became
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
a
man
strength
over
that
of
a
boy
our
disarmament
was
complete
not
a
bow
or
arrow
was
left
to
us
we
continued
to
expostulate
against
the
injustice
that
had
been
done
to
us
but
the
two
fellows
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
our
words
pleased
with
their
easy
victory
they
began
to
amuse
themselves
standing
at
a
little
distance
from
us
they
discharged
our
arrows
at
various
marks
they
were
miserable
shots
and
could
not
hit
anything
and
so
on
concluding
that
this
was
no
fun
they
shot
our
arrows
far
and
wide
into
the
thickets
where
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
find
them
again
this
exercise
seemed
to
dissipate
their
anger
and
when
the
arrows
were
all
gone
they
came
to
us
and
threw
all
our
bows
on
the
ground
there
said
one
of
them
you
can
take
them
and
go
home
with
them
and
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
give
up
coming
out
here
with
your
bows
and
arrows
and
stick
to
your
charcoal
sadly
the
ringgold
archers
resumed
their
homeward
march
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
joined
by
their
two
comrades
who
had
been
hiding
in
the
bushes
some
of
us
were
inclined
to
give
the
young
scamps
another
whipping
for
getting
us
into
such
a
scrape
and
we
were
the
more
angry
because
they
did
not
seem
in
the
least
sorry
for
what
they
had
done
but
finally
the
matter
was
smoothed
over
and
we
marched
peaceably
on
together
before
they
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
city
the
ringgold
archers
halted
and
took
off
their
uniforms
most
of
these
were
sadly
bedraggled
and
torn
in
the
struggles
with
the
young
men
and
furthermore
they
seemed
more
like
the
gowns
of
the
than
they
had
done
before
each
of
us
rolled
his
uniform
around
his
bow
and
carried
them
home
under
his
arm
and
such
of
us
as
had
feathers
in
our
hats
took
them
out
and
threw
them
away
that
was
the
last
expedition
of
the
ringgold
archers
although
we
gave
up
the
idea
of
emulating
the
deeds
of
robin
hood
little
john
and
friar
tuck
some
of
us
became
very
good
amateur
archers
as
to
major
ringgold
his
blighted
affections
and
his
flowing
hair
they
faded
out
of
our
minds
with
the
memory
of
our
torn
and
discarded
uniforms
of
blue
a
constabulary
slip
by
paine
when
the
snow
falls
in
the
city
oh
it
seems
a
dreadful
pity
and
it
costs
a
lot
to
cart
it
all
away
but
the
boys
who
on
the
walk
make
the
dangerous
slide
would
like
to
have
the
snow
come
every
day
oh
it
fun
to
hear
them
shout
as
they
slip
and
slide
about
like
some
eerie
cheery
spirits
of
the
storm
but
just
call
out
cheese
the
cop
and
how
suddenly
they
stop
for
the
copper
has
a
duty
to
perform
now
yous
fellies
git
a
gait
he
exclaims
and
if
they
wait
come
now
yous
jus
chase
yourselves
right
off
de
block
but
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
often
sympathized
with
his
victims
and
his
heart
were
a
rock
for
was
but
the
other
night
when
no
roundsman
was
in
sight
that
i
saw
a
copper
running
down
the
street
was
he
chasing
of
a
thief
do
you
err
in
that
belief
he
was
sliding
on
each
slide
along
his
beat
ducks
once
a
gentleman
reproved
his
negro
servant
for
serving
a
duck
for
dinner
to
which
there
was
only
one
leg
he
suspected
sam
of
having
eaten
the
missing
limb
oh
no
sir
replied
sam
these
ducks
have
only
one
leg
indeed
said
the
master
i
must
see
them
so
the
next
morning
he
told
sam
to
show
him
the
ducks
sam
conducted
his
master
to
the
and
pointed
to
half
a
dozen
ducks
each
standing
on
one
leg
near
the
pond
there
sah
he
exclaimed
the
master
waved
his
arms
and
cried
out
shoo
shoo
and
the
ducks
scampered
away
how
about
that
he
said
turning
to
sam
that
right
sah
returned
sam
calmly
but
why
did
yo
shoo
de
oder
duck
las
night
a
valentine
party
by
mary
sleight
the
chadwick
girls
one
february
morning
were
deep
in
consultation
as
to
the
best
way
in
which
to
entertain
their
friend
dorothy
adams
who
was
coming
the
next
week
to
make
them
a
two
days
visit
why
not
have
a
valentine
party
instead
of
a
tea
suggested
catharine
teas
are
so
stiff
and
poky
when
one
is
not
acquainted
with
any
of
the
other
guests
and
dorothy
is
one
that
likes
a
thoroughly
good
time
a
valentine
party
would
be
much
more
lively
of
course
said
helen
but
where
in
the
world
could
we
find
enough
valentines
to
go
round
write
them
the
same
as
the
girls
did
in
grandmother
livingston
day
answered
catharine
even
if
we
have
any
especial
gift
for
we
can
string
some
passable
rhymes
together
i
hope
how
would
it
do
asked
stately
elizabeth
beginning
to
be
interested
to
have
bows
or
rosettes
of
ribbon
two
of
each
color
distributed
and
let
each
person
take
for
a
partner
the
one
that
wears
the
corresponding
badge
then
of
course
there
would
have
to
be
two
sets
of
valentines
for
example
here
give
me
your
pencil
catharine
please
and
that
empty
envelope
how
would
this
do
blue
no
fastening
her
badge
to
the
lapel
of
her
partner
coat
as
ladies
fair
in
days
of
old
to
chosen
knights
their
colors
gave
this
ribbon
blue
i
give
to
you
and
this
dear
valentine
i
crave
that
you
the
little
badge
will
take
and
bravely
wear
it
for
my
sake
and
something
like
this
for
an
answer
blue
no
fastening
his
own
badge
on
his
lady
gown
of
all
the
merry
throng
with
colors
rich
and
rare
bedight
believe
me
none
will
prove
more
true
than
he
who
wears
this
bonny
blue
bravo
beth
cried
the
others
verily
i
believe
it
catching
exclaimed
helen
i
too
have
an
idea
quick
give
me
a
pencil
and
straightway
all
three
fell
to
scribbling
each
taking
a
different
color
for
her
subject
and
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
cudgelling
their
brains
the
following
rhymes
were
ready
to
be
copied
red
no
red
as
my
own
is
the
badge
i
seek
and
red
as
a
rose
is
the
wearer
cheek
why
art
thou
thrilling
heart
of
mine
ah
if
i
knew
they
were
both
for
me
the
badge
and
the
blush
on
bended
knee
i
would
sue
for
the
love
of
my
valentine
no
this
ruddy
bow
for
thee
i
bind

true
and
thou
wilt
ever
find
warm

the
heart
that
wears
the
red
no
scorn
nor
coldness
needst
thou
dread
pink
no
my
lady
fair
doth
wear
the
tint
that
deep
within
the
glows
but
like
the
shell
beneath
the
pink
her
heart
is
white
as
alpine
snows
no
i
would
this
little
knot
of
pink
might
be
dear
valentine

lines
for
us
be
cast
to
hold
our
friendship
firm
and
fast

no
dear
valentine
one
boon
i
ask
pray
make
it
not
a
loveless
task
nor
think
me
somewhat
overbold
when
you
this
yellow
knot

ask
not
the
reason
why
within
your
own
my
hand

oh
maiden
fair
whose
badge
is
yellow
let

knight

this
thy
motto

and
true

of
two
colors

colors

in
this
radiant
badge
entwine
i
single
from
the
lovely
ranks
and
claim
her
for
my
valentine

no

i

not

this
tawny
gift

and
fastening
hers
to
his

no
though
this
badge
may
seem
disdain
it
not

oft
i
deem
those
forced

are
worthy
of
love
brightest

a
white

star
no
the
bravest
knight
in
arthur
train
was
he
who
wore
with
a
stain
the
shining
badge
of
purity
and
since
i
know
that
thou
art
true
and
that
my
trust
i
shall
rue
this
token

i
yield
to
thee
no
thy
gift
as
pure
as
thy
radiant

i
take

heart
with
the
reverent
vow
that
whether
the
way
be
near
or
far
i
follow
the
lead
of
my
lady
star
there
said
helen
counting
in
the
first
two
we
have
sixteen
and
the
two
sets
must
be
put
in
separate
baskets
and
drawn
for
the
next
question
is
what
are
the
people
to
do
after
they
find
their
partners
we
must
seat
each
couple
at
a
table
and
give
them
some
puzzle
or
problem
to
work
out
together
said
catharine
promptly
how
would
astronomical
answer
you
can
get
that
up
beth
you
are
so
fond
of
but
do
make
it
too
prosy
i
attempt
it
only
on
one
condition
answered
elizabeth
neither
of
you
must
see
it
until
it
is
given
to
the
rest
very
well
beth
we
leave
you
to
yourself
while
we
copy
the
valentines
and
this
is
what
elizabeth
set
them
to
pondering
over
on
eve
an
astronomical
once
upon
a
time
it
chanced
that
the
in
the
satellite
of
the
earth
fell
desperately
in
love
with
a
certain
fair
sixth
sign
of
the
zodiac
and
the
latter
having
first
dutifully
asked
her
one
of
the
primary
planets
permission
readily
consented
to
marry
him
for
bridemaids
they
chose
one
of
the
northern
constellations
who
was
noted
for
her
shining
hair
and
a
northern
constellation
a
princess
who
had
once
been
chained
to
a
rock
on
the
while
for
groomsmen
they
had
the
twin
brothers
and
third
sign
of
the
zodiac
at
the
the
bride
sat
in
chair
a
northern
constellation
and
as
they
were
fond
of
they
had
on
the
menu
deviled
fourth
sign
of
the
zodiac
and
broiled
twelfth
sign
of
the
zodiac
with
eleventh
sign
of
the
zodiac
for
their
after
breakfast
they
had
a
game
of
and
northern
constellation
with
their
guests
and
the
bride
being
a
fine
musician
entertained
them
by
playing
the
northern
constellation
as
there
were
no
railroads
in
the
country
they
harnessed
northern
constellation
to
charles
northern
constellation
and
took
the
route
known
as
it
seems
very
selfish
to
be
seeking
only
our
own
pleasure
suggested
the
bride
who
like
every
truly
happy
bride
wanted
all
the
world
to
share
her
joy
and
the
groom
being
a
sworn
knight
decided
that
they
would
go
in
search
of
the
lost
becoming
thirsty
on
the
journey
they
stopped
at
a
well
you
can
drink
from
the
little
said
the
groom
and
i
from
the
big
but
a
great
a
southern
constellation
began
barking
at
them
and
before
they
could
get
back
to
the
wagon
they
were
butted
by
a
vicious
first
sign
of
the
zodiac
and
came
near
being
tossed
by
an
angry
second
sign
of
the
zodiac
a
little
later
in
passing
through
a
thicket
they
met
a
roaring
fifth
sign
of
the
zodiac
but
the
groom
being
a
fine
ninth
sign
of
the
zodiac
slew
him
with
an
northern
constellation
and
when
shortly
afterward
they
encountered
a
great
grizzly
and
a
little
one
northern
constellations
he
made
an
end
of
the
old
one
in
the
same
way
but
the
little
one
was
too
bright
for
him
and
chasing
the
tip
of
his
tail
they
presently
reached
that
around
which
the
are
the
only
dancers
on
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
there
was
nothing
to
mar
their
pleasure
but
after
they
reached
the
groom
palace
the
trail
of
the
northern
constellation
soon
made
a
change
for
the
groom
in
his
own
house
like
many
another
husband
was
as
eccentric
as
a
flying
off
in
a
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
though
he
had
always
been
reputed
to
be
made
of
gold
he
proved
so
poor
that
he
could
afford
no
except
what
he
borrowed
from
his
generous
father
the
whom
he
disrespectfully
called
old
the
bride
in
her
disappointment
declared
that
he
had
been
weighed
in
the
seventh
sign
of
the
zodiac
and
found
wanting
and
also
charged
him
with
having
become
so
infatuated
with
the
most
beautiful
of
the
planets
that
she
herself
was
totally
and
though
he
protested
that
she
was
still
his
morning
and
his
evening
and
that
he
would
willingly
endure
for
her
the
labors
of
northern
constellation
she
refused
to
be
reconciled
whereupon
he
made
way
with
himself
by
taking
an
overdose
of
one
of
the
planets
and
the
bride
in
a
fit
of
remorse
hid
a
eighth
sign
of
the
zodiac
in
her
bosom
and
suffered
the
fate
of
egyptian
queen
a
copy
of
this
puzzle
having
been
given
to
each
couple
half
an
hour
was
allowed
for
the
filling
of
the
blank
spaces
after
which
prizes
were
awarded
to
those
who
had
made
out
the
papers
correctly
illustration
each
couple
had
a
copy
of
the
puzzle
the
middleton
bowl
begun
in
harper
round
table
no
by
ellen
douglas
deland
chapter
vi
it
was
four
in
the
morning
before
the
household
began
to
settle
down
into
its
accustomed
quiet
miss
joanna
was
at
last
sleeping
quietly
and
the
doctor
assured
the
sisters
that
they
need
fear
no
further
danger
he
begged
them
to
go
to
their
rooms
and
try
to
get
some
rest
for
he
saw
that
the
four
ladies
were
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
which
was
almost
alarming
miss
middleton
declared
that
she
should
not
leave
her
sister
joanna
but
she
begged
the
others
to
follow
the
doctor
advice
miss
thomasine
as
she
passed
theodora
room
opened
the
door
quietly
and
looked
in
she
intended
to
tell
her
niece
if
she
were
awake
that
her
aunt
joanna
was
decidedly
better
but
when
miss
thomasine
peeped
into
the
room
which
was
but
dimly
lighted
she
was
astonished
to
find
that
theodora
was
not
there
she
stepped
inside
and
looked
again
the
bed
was
empty
as
was
also
the
lounge
the
room
was
not
large
and
one
could
see
at
a
glance
that
it
was
not
occupied
miss
thomasine
felt
a
shock
similar
to
the
one
which
she
had
experienced
when
she
was
told
that
joanna
had
one
of
her
attacks
where
could
the
child
be
in
the
hall
she
met
miss
dorcas
and
miss
melissa
theodora
is
not
in
her
room
she
whispered
where
do
you
suppose
she
is
sisters
and
what
had
we
better
do
the
three
stood
and
looked
at
one
another
without
their
two
ruling
spirits
adaline
and
joanna
whose
words
were
always
law
the
three
younger
sisters
felt
much
as
if
they
were
a
ship
deprived
of
both
captain
and
pilot
in
a
stormy
sea
they
drew
a
step
nearer
to
one
another
perhaps
said
miss
melissa
perhaps
there
no
knowing
she
might
do
anything
she
went
again
went
where
asked
miss
dorcas
do
you
mean
on
the
the
do
you
mean
the
bicycle
asked
miss
thomasine
courageously
uttering
the
obnoxious
word
miss
melissa
nodded
oh
it
could
not
be
said
miss
dorcas
certainly
not
exclaimed
miss
thomasine
the
child
is
somewhere
in
the
house
and
we
must
look
for
her
they
investigated
the
rooms
on
the
second
floor
with
no
success
and
then
they
descended
the
broad
stairs
one
behind
the
other
each
clad
in
a
flowered
and
enveloped
in
a
worsted
shawl
and
each
one
carrying
a
lighted
candle
in
a
tall
silver
candlestick
over
their
heads
shorn
of
the
additional
braids
which
adorned
them
by
day
and
in
no
state
to
be
seen
by
the
doctor
or
even
by
the
servants
each
sister
had
tied
a
white
knit
cloud
even
miss
melissa
when
she
removed
her
bonnet
after
her
futile
attempt
to
summon
the
doctor
had
again
adjusted
her
cloud
and
now
they
crept
down
their
own
staircase
feeling
strangely
ill
at
ease
never
before
had
they
been
downstairs
at
this
hour
and
in
this
costume
but
theodora
must
be
found
illustration
theodora
lay
on
the
sofa
asleep
the
parlor
door
stood
open
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
it
was
dark
there
now
for
the
moon
had
set
and
it
was
not
yet
dawn
the
three
ladies
gathered
at
the
threshold
and
holding
their
candles
on
high
peered
into
the
room
there
on
the
sofa
lay
theodora
one
arm
hanging
over
the
side
the
other
tossed
above
her
head
as
the
aunts
drew
nearer
she
moved
a
little
and
murmured
in
her
sleep
of
course
i
believe
you
it
dreadful
not
to
be
believed
then
the
gleam
of
the
three
candles
shone
full
in
her
face
and
she
wakened
her
eyes
blinking
in
the
light
why
what
is
it
she
cried
starting
up
in
terror
and
gazing
at
the
three
odd
figures
where
am
i
and
who
are
you
who
you
i
say
my
dear
teddy
said
miss
thomasine
do
not
be
alarmed

you
not
know
us
why
it
aunt
tom
said
their
niece
wonderingly
and
aunt
dorcas
and
aunt
melissa

know
how
funny

miss
dorcas
severely

know
that

is
the
middle
of
the
night

it
really
then
how

i
get

and

andy
morse
oh

an
exciting
night
i
gave

the
kitchen

but
he
was
so
hungry
and
he

promised

after
this
the
three
aunts
looked
at
one
another
and
then
at
teddy
flushed
face
miss
thomasine
felt
her
pulse
and
asked
to
see
her
tongue
you
have
been
dreaming
i
suppose
come
up
stairs
and
go
to
bed
my
dear
but
i
did
dream
that
aunt
tom
andy
morse
was
really
here
and
i
gave
him
some
money
to
go
away
with
i
had
some
in
my
bank
you
know
so
i
could
do
what
i
liked
with
it
she
grows
more
and
more
incoherent
said
miss
dorcas
i
think
sisters
murmured
miss
melissa
that
that
it
would
be
as
well
the
doctor
right
here
i
agree
with
you
said
miss
thomasine
she
most
certainly
is
not
well
and
the
doctor
had
better
see
her
teddy
dear
come
up
stairs
lean
on
me
if
you
feel
at
all
giddy
i
not
a
bit
giddy
cried
theodora
springing
to
her
feet
and
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
why
must
i
see
the
doctor
i
am
not
sick
and
oh
i
do
want
to
tell
you
about
andy
morse
again
the
sisters
looked
significantly
at
one
another
then
miss
thomasine
took
one
of
teddy
hands
and
miss
dorcas
possessed
herself
of
the
other
while
miss
melissa
walked
in
front
with
two
of
the
candles
we
must
get
her
to
bed
as
quietly
as
possible
said
miss
thomasine
oh
what
a
night
this
has
been
i
was
sure
that
ride
would
be
too
much
for
her
said
miss
dorcas
is
it
do
you
think
it
can
be
i
have
heard
of
it
brain
fever
whispered
miss
melissa
turning
in
affright
what
do
you
all
mean
exclaimed
teddy
wrenching
her
hands
away
from
her
aunts
i
tell
you
i
not
a
bit
sick
and
i
do
wish
you
would
let
me
go
up
stairs
alone
and
i
do
see
why
you
wo
believe
what
i
say
are
you
never
going
to
believe
me
again
i
wish
you
would
let
me
tell
you
about
andy
morse
he
hid
behind
the
big
sofa
and
i
heard
him
there
and
asked
him
to
come
out
do
you
know
that
poor
boy
had
had
a
thing
to
eat
for
two
days
just
think
of
it
and
he
was
so
desperate
he
came
here
to
steal
something
i
do
wonder
do
you
the
sisters
had
again
looked
at
one
another
meaningly
and
during
this
speech
miss
dorcas
had
left
the
room
presently
she
returned
with
the
doctor
what
all
this
he
asked
teddy
ill
after
saving
her
aunt
life
as
she
did
she
does
look
very
of
course
i
not
ill
morton
they
wo
believe
me
when
i
say
that
andy
morse
was
hiding
here
and
i
gave
him
something
to
eat
and
the
money
out
of
my
bank
if
you
go
into
the
kitchen
you
will
see
the
plates
and
things
on
the
table
and
if
you
go
up
to
my
room
you
will
see
the
empty
bank
i
do
wish
my
father
and
mother
were
here
she
added
just
tired
of
not
being
believed
the
doctor
felt
her
pulse
and
looked
at
her
i
believe
you
my
child
he
said
you
are
as
well
as
i
am
and
i
have
no
doubt
andy
morse
was
here
he
is
quite
capable
of
anything
i
am
sorry
you
gave
him
your
money
for
he
does
deserve
it
but
i
quite
believe
you
theodora
glanced
at
him
gratefully
and
from
that
moment
she
considered
morton
one
of
her
best
friends
he
asked
her
more
particularly
about
the
occurrences
of
the
night
and
she
gave
him
a
detailed
history
of
it
from
the
time
when
she
returned
from
her
ride
well
well
he
said
when
he
heard
how
she
had
stood
in
the
moonlight
and
invited
the
intruder
to
come
forth
well
well
you
the
girl
for
my
mind
and
did
you
feel
afraid
why
yes
i
suppose
i
was
afraid
said
she
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
that
i
could
think
of
and
so
i
had
to
do
it
at
which
the
doctor
chuckled
more
appreciatively
than
ever
miss
joanna
was
much
better
in
the
morning
and
in
a
few
days
was
quite
convalescent
the
sisters
were
all
more
or
less
prostrated
by
this
thrilling
night
and
it
was
a
week
before
the
household
affairs
were
running
with
their
accustomed
smoothness
and
before
the
misses
middleton
could
turn
their
thoughts
and
their
conversation
to
the
ordinary
concerns
of
life
a
new
idea
and
a
very
startling
one
had
been
presented
to
them
too
morton
upon
each
of
his
visits
to
miss
joanna
had
made
some
remark
upon
theodora
courage
upon
her
presence
of
mind
upon
her
general
excellence
he
declared
that
she
and
she
alone
had
been
the
means
of
saving
her
aunt
life
and
in
his
opinion
she
should
be
rewarded
not
only
for
that
but
for
having
prevented
a
bold
and
startling
robbery
undoubtedly
andy
morse
if
left
to
himself
would
have
carried
away
the
greater
part
of
the
misses
middleton
treasures
according
to
morton
if
it
had
not
been
for
teddy
her
aunts
when
they
descended
in
the
morning
would
have
found
their
large
absolutely
bare
and
empty
the
girl
should
certainly
be
rewarded
and
no
better
token
of
her
aunts
gratitude
and
regard
could
be
found
than
a
bicycle
not
only
would
it
give
her
pleasure
but
it
would
also
be
of
benefit
to
her
health
never
before
did
morton
discourse
so
long
and
so
earnestly
and
the
result
was
that
he
gained
his
point
the
ladies
held
out
as
long
as
they
could
but
he
was
too
much
for
them
as
miss
joanna
remarked
when
we
feel
that
theodora
really
did
us
such
a
service
it
seems
as
if
we
should
waive
our
prejudices
and
for
miss
joanna
to
acknowledge
this
and
to
call
prejudices
the
feelings
which
had
hitherto
been
designated
as
principles
meant
a
great
deal
miss
thomasine
had
from
the
first
been
in
favor
of
buying
the
wheel
and
had
strongly
urged
it
but
not
until
miss
joanna
thus
expressed
herself
did
miss
middleton
actually
give
her
consent
john
the
old
coachman
now
fortunately
recovered
from
his
attack
of
rheumatism
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
when
miss
middleton
ordered
him
to
drive
to
the
large
on
main
street
the
carriage
with
its
four
occupants
reached
the
shop
in
due
time
and
the
ladies
entered
they
looked
about
in
some
bewilderment
at
the
vast
number
of
bicycles
that
were
stacked
in
the
place
and
the
thought
that
they
could
all
whirl
as
wheels
will
made
them
positively
dizzy
miss
melissa
was
glad
that
she
had
brought
her
salts
and
she
held
them
first
to
one
nostril
then
to
the
other
what
can
i
do
for
you
ladies
asked
the
salesman
as
he
came
forward
we
wish
to
look
at
said
miss
middleton
wondering
if
it
could
be
really
she
who
was
making
this
request
and
wishing
more
than
ever
that
miss
joanna
were
there
to
take
the
lead
ah
indeed
something
for
yourselves
no
doubt
not
by
any
means
said
miss
middleton
coldly
and
with
all
the
middleton
manner
that
she
could
summon
to
her
aid
we
are
about
to
purchase
a
for
our
niece
oh
certainly
i
did
see
her
at
first
so
many
ladies
do
ride
that
i
thought
however
here
is
one
that
i
am
sure
your
niece
will
like
light
weight
not
more
than
twenty
pounds
improved
chain
and
skirt
guards
made
in
such
a
way
that
there
is
a
minimum
degree
of
weight
with
a
maximum
amount
of
safety
small
narrow
sweep
of
latest
invention
in
pedals
small
adjustable
saddle
most
comfortable
that
is
made
though
if
your
niece
prefers
one
of
the
new
anatomical
saddles
that
can
easily
be
arranged
bell
brake
lantern
and
cyclometer
thrown
in
if
you
pay
cash
down
together
with
a
full
supply
of
cement
patches
plugs
twine
and
needle
for
a
punctured
tire
also
pump
and
wrench
or
if
you
do
fancy
this
model
here
is
another
pounds
tires
in
case
of
punctures
oh
please
stop
a
moment
cried
miss
middleton
my
dear
sisters
i
scarcely
know
what
to
think
if
only
joanna
were
here
i
never
dreamed
that
there
were
so
many
accessories
to
a
it
seems
as
if
we
were
getting
a
great
deal
for
the
money
a
great
deal
madam
i
do
assure
you
and
at
the
same
time
very
light
weight
to
be
sure
the
tendency
this
year
is
to
make
heavier
machines
but
this
being
a
miss
wheel
it
is
absolutely
strong
while
being
at
the
same
time
exceedingly
light
just
lift
it
yourself
madam
and
you
will
see
and
before
she
realized
what
she
was
doing
miss
middleton
had
laid
aside
her
little
satchel
and
her
sunshade
and
was
actually
lifting
a
bicycle
each
sister
in
turn
not
to
be
outdone
went
through
the
same
form
one
wheel
after
another
was
brought
forward
and
each
one
seemed
to
possess
more
virtues
than
its
predecessor
the
three
misses
middleton
grew
more
and
more
bewildered
while
theodora
began
to
think
that
the
matter
would
never
be
settled
she
had
no
opportunity
for
stating
her
preference
if
she
had
any
for
her
aunts
appeared
to
think
that
she
knew
nothing
at
all
on
the
subject
their
interest
increased
with
their
bewilderment
and
they
soon
found
themselves
conversing
with
ease
about
gear
and
and
the
salesman
did
not
allow
himself
even
to
smile
when
miss
thomasine
examined
the
and
said
it
seemed
like
an
excellent
brake
he
had
begun
to
hope
that
he
might
dispose
of
four
wheels
instead
of
one
so
enthusiastic
were
his
customers
becoming
so
it
might
have
gone
on
for
some
time
longer
and
there
is
no
knowing
what
might
have
transpired
had
not
paul
hoyt
greatly
to
relief
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
had
heard
rumors
of
the
intended
purchase
and
he
had
at
once
mounted
his
own
wheel
and
ridden
in
search
of
his
neighbors
knowing
that
it
would
be
an
entertaining
sight
to
say
the
least
and
thinking
that
he
might
find
an
opportunity
for
giving
his
opinion
and
lending
the
weight
of
his
experience
the
misses
middleton
paid
more
attention
to
him
than
they
did
to
theodora
and
at
last
a
wheel
was
chosen
and
paid
for
and
the
three
ladies
with
their
niece
left
the
shop
they
drove
away
still
full
of
their
subject
and
when
the
new
bicycle
came
home
it
was
brought
directly
to
them
the
three
misses
middleton
who
had
made
the
purchase
explained
to
the
two
who
were
still
in
ignorance
of
its
merits
the
great
advantages
which
this
possessed
over
every
other
make
of
machine
while
teddy
looked
on
wondering
when
the
happy
moment
would
arrive
that
she
could
take
the
beloved
object
and
go
forth
for
a
ride
upon
her
own
own
wheel
indeed
she
could
scarcely
express
her
gratitude
to
her
aunts
so
engrossed
were
they
in
all
the
technicalities
of
the
subject
about
ten
days
after
this
hoyt
accompanied
by
arthur
called
upon
the
misses
middleton
the
ladies
came
down
to
the
and
greeted
their
guests
with
their
usual
formal
courtesy
there
was
a
moment
pause
after
all
had
seated
themselves
and
then
hoyt
began
the
conversation
i
have
come
she
said
to
speak
once
more
on
the
subject
of
the
bowl
have
you
found
yet
any
clew
to
the
person
who
broke
it
no
said
miss
middleton
we
have
not
but
we
still
have
our
suspicious
interposed
miss
joanna
and
what
are
they
we
did
think
that
it
was
either
arthur
or
theodora
now
we
are
convinced
that
it
was
arthur
and
that
our
niece
from
a
mistaken
feeling
of
honor
helped
him
to
hide
it
nothing
can
change
us
in
this
opinion
i
have
come
to
tell
you
said
hoyt
quietly
but
with
great
firmness
that
hoyt
and
i
are
perfectly
convinced
that
arthur
did
do
it
the
evidence
is
very
strong
against
him
we
admit
but
he
has
always
been
a
truthful
boy
and
we
feel
very
sure
that
he
is
so
still
the
child
has
been
made
so
unhappy
by
the
affair
that
i
felt
it
necessary
to
bring
him
here
and
let
him
hear
me
tell
you
that
his
father
and
i
do
not
think
he
did
it
she
rose
to
go
in
the
pause
that
followed
this
speech
the
sisters
were
silent
until
they
also
had
risen
and
then
miss
joanna
spoke
our
opinion
is
unchanged
said
she
and
always
will
be
at
this
moment
the
parlor
door
flew
open
and
theodora
ran
into
the
room
i
have
just
met
the
postman
she
cried
and
he
gave
me
this
letter
look
at
it
and
she
held
it
up
for
her
aunts
inspection
the
envelope
was
exceedingly
soiled
and
the
stamp
was
placed
upside
down
on
the
lower
corner
it
was
addressed
to
miss
tedy
middleton
it
is
from
andy
morse
she
continued
and
oh
arthur
he
tells
it
all
and
this
was
what
she
read
aloud
tedy
middleton

broke
that
bole
teddy
paused
in
the
reading
and
looked
about
upon
her
audience
her
five
aunts
sank
into
their
chairs
and
miss
melissa
vigorously
applied
her
salts
while
much
to
arthur
amazement
his
mother
began
to
cry
teddy
continued
was
that
mad
the
day

black

bekorse
ile
be
to
see
wen
you
read
this
when
teddy
had
finished
the
letter
miss
joanna
settled
her
spectacles
more
firmly
upon
her
aristocratic
aquiline
nose
then
she
held
out
her
hand
for
the
paper
which
she
took
and
examined
with
care
it
was
passed
from
one
sister
to
another
as
they
sat
in
an
impressive
silence
which
was
broken
as
usual
by
miss
joanna
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
going
to
hoyt
she
took
her
by
the
hand
we
beg
your
pardon
ellen
hoyt
said
she
and
we
beg
your
pardon
he
is
a
truthful
boy
after
all
as
theodora
is
a
truthful
girl
is
it
not
so
sisters
it
is
indeed
so
replied
they
all
as
they
also
rose
and
gathered
about
their
guests
thus
arthur
was
at
last
cleared
from
suspicion
and
relieved
from
the
state
of
dread
and
anxiety
in
which
he
had
lived
since
the
accident
for
morse
had
not
only
threatened
him
at
the
time
should
he
give
any
information
as
to
what
he
had
done
but
had
constantly
found
means
since
then
of
frightening
the
boy
which
accounted
for
his
nervous
condition
and
the
misses
middleton
were
at
last
convinced
that
neither
arthur
nor
theodora
had
broken
the
middleton
bowl
the
end
a
loyal
traitor
a
story
of
the
war
of
between
america
and
england
by
james
barnes
chapter
xvii
wherein
i
become
an
officer
i
suppose
if
i
were
writing
a
tale
of
invention
i
could
imagine
no
stranger
happenings
than
those
i
have
recorded
in
the
last
few
pages
of
this
old
ledger
but
as
almost
everything
has
an
explanation
and
can
be
sifted
down
to
the
why
and
wherefore
when
we
keep
off
the
subject
of
religion
and
beliefs
i
can
make
plain
in
a
few
words
the
situation
if
a
ship
without
a
captain
is
a
man
without
a
soul
truly
a
ship
without
a
compass
is
a
man
without
an
eye
and
that
was
what
was
the
matter
with
the
topsail
schooner
of
new
bedford
four
days
before
i
had
come
on
board
she
had
had
an
encounter
with
an
english
ship
that
had
offered
resistance
during
the
course
of
the
action
the
binnacle
of
the
had
been
shot
away
and
the
compass
smashed
to
flinders
but
the
english
ship
had
been
taken
and
was
the
seventh
prize
in
a
cruise
of
less
than
four
months
captain
gorham
had
manned
her
and
sent
her
home
the
only
compass
left
on
board
the
was
a
needle
in
a
wooden
box
but
as
plummer
told
me
it
was
all
out
of
kilter
and
as
useless
to
steer
by
as
a
twirled
now
for
three
days
after
the
last
capture
there
had
been
such
thick
weather
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
get
a
sight
of
the
sun
moon
or
stars
and
had
sailed
not
by
as
the
wind
had
blown
from
all
quarters
but
by
sheer
guesswork
and
the
lead
how
it
came
about
that
captain
gorham
knew
the
french
cockswain
was
simple
although
the
captain
was
an
american
born
and
raised
only
a
few
years
previous
to
the
outbreak
of
the
war
he
had
done
a
little
smuggling
on
his
own
account
between
dunquerque
and
the
coast
of
england
so
what
appeared
at
first
to
be
most
mysterious
is
really
simple
when
we
come
to
look
at
it
but
now
to
tell
of
what
we
did
it
had
been
captain
gorham
intention
i
take
it
to
run
into
dunquerque
harbor
but
owing
to
the
representations
of
pierre
burron
who
stated
that
he
might
never
leave
it
if
we
did
so
this
idea
was
given
up
and
keeping
the
lead
going
we
took
the
wind
on
our
quarter
and
made
off
to
the
southward
the
captain
promising
to
put
the
little
frenchman
on
board
the
first
vessel
hound
for
his
country
and
pay
him
well
for
his
services
while
we
had
been
coming
about
i
to
show
my
willingness
had
hauled
lustily
on
the
mainsheet
and
pitched
in
with
the
crew
and
as
soon
as
everything
was
going
well
plummer
and
i
sat
down
against
the
bowsprit
and
began
to
spin
our
respective
yarns
of
course
there
was
much
to
tell
mine
is
known
already
and
plummer
was
but
the
recounting
of
the
most
unusual
good
luck
that
had
ever
attended
the
career
of
a
cruiser
in
any
service
i
suppose
it
seems
that
finding
the
had
sailed
before
he
expected
she
would
be
ready
plummer
had
delayed
a
long
time
before
he
had
found
a
berth
to
suit
his
fancy
and
then
he
had
shipped
in
the
from
new
bedford
from
the
day
of
their
sailing
they
had
had
fair
winds
and
good
fortune
capturing
two
english
vessels
off
the
american
coast
laden
with
supplies
for
the
english
army
in
canada
two
more
on
the
high
seas
and
three
of
all
places
in
the
world
but
almost
under
the
nose
of
the
british
admiralty
at
the
entrance
to
their
own
private
channel
in
all
these
encounters
they
had
lost
but
two
men
killed
and
three
slightly
wounded
the
manning
of
so
many
prizes
had
reduced
the
crew
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
men
to
all
told
being
a
vessel
this
was
more
than
sufficient
to
run
her
properly
and
although
it
was
considered
foolhardiness
in
the
forecastle
old
smiley
or
smiler
as
they
called
gorham
had
determined
to
make
one
more
attempt
before
he
started
for
the
states
besides
the
necessity
of
speaking
some
vessel
and
securing
a
compass
had
now
become
imperative
tell
me
something
of
your
skipper
plummer
i
asked
he
is
of
a
certainty
the
man
i
ever
met
well
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
plummer
answered
in
a
whisper
he
as
mad
as
the
king
of
bedlam
that
is
to
my
thinking
in
fact
on
shore
they
say
he
is
in
league
with
the
devil
but
whether
it
is
the
devil
or
the
powers
above
he
certainly
carries
a
fair
pinch
of
good
luck
his
thumb
and
his
forefinger
you
have
heard
him
sing
yet
wait
till
you
hear
him
at
that
it
will
make
the
flesh
crawl
on
your
back
my
lad
but
mark
ye
he
a
good
seaman
for
all
of
his
vagaries
and
he
can
any
two
of
us
the
only
other
officer
capable
of
navigation
left
on
board
the
schooner
was
the
third
lieutenant
carter
who
had
been
one
of
the
slightly
wounded
and
who
yet
carried
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
as
plummer
and
i
were
talking
the
lieutenant
came
on
deck
and
ordered
us
to
shake
out
the
reef
in
the
mainsail
that
we
had
taken
in
some
time
back
and
set
the
topsail
and
flying
jib
the
weather
was
clearing
up
and
the
wind
going
down
at
the
same
time
the
sun
now
broke
through
the
clouds
and
by
noon
it
was
fine
clear
weather
to
the
eastward
we
could
see
the
shores
of
france
while
to
the
westward
the
white
cliffs
of
england
shone
plain
to
sight
a
number
of
sail
could
be
seen
skirting
the
english
coast
but
nothing
in
the
way
of
shipping
could
we
make
out
on
the
other
hand
but
after
we
had
altered
our
course
slightly
to
the
eastward
at
three
in
the
afternoon
we
made
out
a
brown
sail
hugging
the
east
shore
and
evidently
endeavoring
to
make
the
entrance
to
a
small
port
not
far
from
the
mouth
of
a
little
bay
we
could
see
the
houses
and
steeples
plainly
it
was
evidently
our
intention
to
head
off
this
little
brown
sail
and
soon
we
saw
that
in
this
we
should
be
successful
as
the
latter
turned
about
and
started
to
run
for
it
but
a
point
of
land
made
her
take
quite
an
offing
and
in
two
hours
we
were
almost
within
hailing
distance
one
of
the
carronades
was
loaded
and
a
shot
fired
across
the
little
vessel
bow
down
came
the
brown
sail
and
she
lay
there
swinging
and
dipping
like
a
wild
fowl
too
frightened
to
escape
i
have
seen
some
clumsy
craft
in
my
day
but
i
think
these
vessels
are
the
she
was
a
french
lugger
only
half
decked
over
with
a
great
leeboard
swung
alongside
and
had
a
comformation
somewhat
like
the
shape
of
the
boat
which
boys
whittle
out
with
their
there
were
five
men
in
her
who
appeared
scared
out
of
their
wits
but
their
relief
was
great
when
captain
gorham
hailed
them
in
french
they
had
no
compass
but
agreed
to
set
our
pilot
on
shore
and
he
left
us
grinning
and
delighted
now
we
cleared
away
again
and
left
the
strait
of
dover
behind
us
steering
a
course
somewhat
to
the
eastward
of
the
middle
of
the
english
channel
i
noticed
that
the
armament
of
the
was
very
similar
to
that
of
the
except
she
carried
one
less
gun
on
a
side
in
the
evening
as
i
was
talking
to
some
of
the
crew
below
a
came
into
the
forecastle
in
search
of
me
with
an
order
for
me
to
repair
aft
at
once
the
captain
wished
me
i
was
thinking
of
exchanging
my
citizen
clothes
for
some
that
plummer
had
offered
me
but
i
had
not
done
so
when
the
message
was
given
me
so
i
hastened
up
captain
gorham
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
little
he
halted
as
he
saw
me
approaching
you
will
dine
with
me
this
evening
hurdiss
he
said
and
if
my
nose
does
not
deceive
me
dinner
is
on
the
table
i
bowed
and
thanked
him
and
we
went
down
into
the
little
cabin
carter
was
on
deck
and
the
captain
and
i
sat
down
no
sooner
had
he
seated
himself
than
he
began
to
hum
or
chant
better
only
without
using
words
beneath
his
breath
this
he
kept
up
even
while
he
was
feeding
himself
as
i
was
very
hungry
i
did
not
interrupt
the
music
and
so
for
full
five
minutes
not
a
word
was
said
at
last
gorham
pushed
back
a
little
ways
from
the
table
and
sang
a
few
words
to
the
same
air
he
had
been
humming
he
chanted
so
i
began
at
once
with
the
cruise
of
the
and
the
fight
with
the
frigate
for
i
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
tell
of
my
earlier
life
it
was
the
second
time
that
i
had
told
the
story
this
day
and
i
probably
hastened
it
when
i
came
to
the
more
exciting
parts
dealing
with
my
prison
life
and
escape
captain
gorham
hummed
a
little
bit
louder
and
this
continuous
accompaniment
urged
me
to
speak
faster
so
i
covered
ground
in
great
fashion
he
played
an
obligato
to
my
solo
as
it
were
piano
fortissimo
and
all
of
it
when
i
had
finished
he
arose
and
hushed
his
noise
as
if
he
had
been
forced
to
bite
the
end
off
the
tune
against
his
will
hurdiss
he
said
we
need
some
one
here
aft
with
us
and
a
berth
for
you
take
it
i
shall
tell
the
men
to
obey
your
orders
as
you
will
obey
mine
you
will
act
as
third
lieutenant
sir
then
as
if
this
settled
matters
he
began
to
hum
again
and
went
up
the
ladder
to
the
deck
leaving
me
sitting
there
in
amazement
here
was
another
false
position
how
fate
had
forced
such
situations
upon
me
it
seemed
a
long
time
ago
that
i
was
supposed
to
be
a
french
nobleman
mark
you
i
was
one
and
i
could
scarce
bring
myself
to
believe
that
my
rescue
had
happened
only
the
very
morning
of
this
day
now
said
i
to
myself
if
i
refuse
to
accept
this
honor
thrust
upon
me
i
may
do
the
very
worst
thing
for
myself
that
may
happen
it
behooved
me
to
balance
matters
carefully
to
weigh
and
measure
possible
results
i
knew
enough
to
give
the
orders
under
ordinary
circumstances
for
the
making
and
taking
in
of
sail
i
could
at
a
pinch
have
stood
my
trick
at
the
wheel
i
could
use
enough
sea
terms
to
lead
one
to
suppose
that
i
knew
more
but
i
knew
none
of
the
methods
used
in
determining
a
position
at
sea
i
had
no
inkling
of
how
to
prick
a
course
on
the
chart
and
what
a
navigator
did
when
he
squinted
at
the
sun
through
a
sextant
i
could
not
imagine
but
yet
i
reasoned
the
captain
and
carter
would
probably
do
all
of
that
that
was
necessary
i
could
get
on
with
the
men
i
felt
sure
and
why
not
undertake
it
thus
i
convinced
myself
that
i
could
become
a
lieutenant
i
had
learned
to
box
the
compass
while
in
prison
and
thinking
of
this
accomplishment
made
me
smile
for
surely
we
would
have
given
something
to
have
possessed
one
to
box
the
good
breeze
held
in
the
same
direction
all
night
long
i
took
the
midnight
watch
and
felt
quite
proud
of
myself
as
the
men
moved
to
obey
my
orders
to
ease
off
the
sheets
when
i
thought
occasion
demanded
it
plummer
appeared
quite
pleased
at
my
promotion
and
the
other
men
had
not
appeared
to
take
any
dislike
to
their
new
officer
so
i
became
quite
tickled
with
the
idea
of
my
importance
and
stopped
my
misgivings
the
next
day
was
sunday
i
think
i
detected
that
captain
gorham
hummed
psalm
tunes
during
breakfast
surely
it
was
old
hundred
that
he
was
repeating
when
i
joined
him
on
deck
in
the
afternoon
but
it
was
no
sunday
breeze
and
we
skipped
along
lively
in
my
opinion
the
would
have
been
no
match
for
the
in
sailing
but
she
would
have
shown
a
clean
pair
of
heels
to
almost
any
english
or
french
cruiser
during
the
day
we
had
passed
within
some
miles
of
a
number
of
vessels
but
they
had
paid
no
attention
to
us
and
it
was
not
until
half
past
five
that
we
had
anything
that
approached
an
interesting
situation
we
were
somewhere
off
the
island
of
alderney
for
the
captain
knew
his
position
to
a
nicety
and
was
steering
a
little
to
the
north
to
give
the
casquet
rocks
a
wide
berth
he
told
me
when
we
made
out
a
vessel
bearing
down
to
meet
us
and
carrying
the
wind
so
that
if
we
kept
on
as
we
were
we
would
pass
near
to
her
in
an
hour
it
could
be
seen
that
she
was
a
frigate
but
captain
gorham
held
the
same
course
undisturbed
it
reminded
me
a
little
of
my
voyage
in
the
to
note
the
anxiety
among
the
crew
the
vessel
was
to
windward
and
had
evidently
been
reconnoitring
the
french
coast
but
she
did
not
show
any
suspicion
and
we
approached
one
another
as
peaceably
as
were
we
two
friendly
merchantmen
all
at
once
the
frigate
tossed
out
her
flag
and
up
went
ours
in
answer
needless
to
say
ours
was
the
same
as
hers
the
cross
of
george
carter
had
brought
up
from
the
cabin
a
canvas
bag
and
a
book
the
edges
of
which
were
weighted
with
lead
there
she
goes
sir
he
said
turning
to
the
captain
and
as
he
spoke
a
little
line
of
streamers
crept
up
the
britisher
the
captain
humming
carelessly
opened
the
book
give
them
four
one
nine
three
seven
carter
he
said
in
a
singsong
five
little
flags
that
the
lieutenant
had
picked
out
rose
on
our
color
halyards
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
what
they
meant
but
it
was
apparently
satisfactory
to
the
frigate
for
she
took
in
her
signals
and
we
did
likewise
plummer
gave
me
a
wink
as
he
gathered
the
colors
in
as
they
fluttered
to
the
deck
we
caught
these
aboard
the
last
prize
he
said
and
just
saved
the
book
from
going
overboard
there
luck
for
you
i
noticed
that
captain
gorham
eyes
were
dancing
as
we
passed
by
the
frigate
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
astern
of
her
but
i
was
totally
unprepared
for
what
he
did
and
stood
aghast
at
his
orders
stand
by
to
cast
loose
and
provide
the
long
twelve
he
shrieked
in
his
high
voice
carter
made
as
if
to
offer
some
remonstrance
but
the
men
grinning
jumped
to
obey
we
had
the
windward
place
now
and
every
advantage
besides
it
would
soon
be
dusk
teedle
dee
dumpty
sang
captain
gorham
as
he
sighted
the
long
gun
himself
as
soon
as
he
had
trained
it
to
his
satisfaction
there
was
a
roar
and
we
all
bent
forward
to
watch
the
shot
i
gave
a
squeal
of
delight
as
i
saw
the
frigate
yard
break
square
in
two
and
with
the
sail
slam
over
against
the
stays
the
captain
of
that
vessel
must
have
been
a
most
surprised
individual
he
yawed
about
and
succeeded
in
getting
taken
all
aback
and
generally
mixed
up
show
our
colors
cried
gorham
and
i
dare
say
the
sight
of
them
surprised
the
englishman
still
more
it
was
full
five
minutes
however
before
he
got
upon
our
track
or
fired
a
gun
then
two
of
his
shot
went
over
us
and
the
rest
fell
short
but
as
we
sailed
three
points
closer
in
the
wind
almost
and
legged
two
feet
for
his
one
he
gave
up
after
half
an
hour
sailing
and
i
wonder
if
he
made
a
report
of
all
this
to
their
lordships
a
night
came
on
i
went
on
watch
at
ten
and
did
a
great
deal
of
thinking
while
i
paced
the
deck
but
my
wandering
thoughts
were
soon
called
back
at
eleven
the
lookout
reported
to
me
that
he
thought
there
was
land
dead
ahead
as
he
could
make
out
lights
i
ran
forward
and
sure
enough
i
could
see
flashes
here
and
there
and
two
or
three
steady
points
of
light
off
our
weather
beam
i
jumped
below
and
called
the
captain
have
you
held
the
same
course
he
asked
i
think
so
sir
unless
the
wind
has
changed
oh
confound
it
we
must
get
a
compass
gorham
grumbled
as
he
ran
up
the
ladder
ahead
of
me
he
ascended
a
short
ways
into
the
weather
shrouds
that
no
shore
he
cried
to
carter
who
had
come
on
deck
barefooted
that
a
big
fleet
bound
out
for
the
indies
that
what
it
is
by
jupiter
we
stop
and
get
a
compass
port
your
helm
he
roared
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
the
booms
swung
out
as
we
got
before
the
wind
we
bore
straight
down
upon
the
lights
that
had
now
increased
in
number
and
vividness
we
slackened
our
speed
by
taking
in
our
topsails
one
after
another
and
hauling
all
sheets
well
aft
by
one
we
were
almost
within
speaking
distance
of
the
two
rearmost
ships
whose
lights
we
could
make
out
very
plainly
as
we
displayed
none
of
our
own
we
were
probably
invisible
owing
to
the
blackness
of
the
night
the
crew
had
all
been
called
on
deck
and
the
carronades
and
the
midship
guns
were
loaded
and
we
came
closer
and
closer
until
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
when
a
lookout
should
discern
our
presence
get
out
the
carter
said
gorham
quietly
he
had
been
squinting
through
a
the
nearest
vessel
is
a
merchant
brig
now
hurdiss
he
added
turning
to
me
and
dropping
his
singsong
for
a
moment
see
what
you
made
of
take
the
carpenter
and
nine
men
and
board
that
brig
they
all
asleep
on
her
do
it
quietly
and
fire
no
shot
unless
you
have
to
here
take
this
cutlass
a
slit
throat
stops
a
shout
almost
before
i
knew
it
the
was
ready
the
men
sitting
on
the
thwarts
with
their
cutlasses
and
pistols
in
their
belts
and
we
had
shoved
off
i
confess
that
i
was
trembling
so
from
excitement
that
my
breath
came
in
short
gasps
and
i
could
not
swallow
for
the
life
of
me
the
carpenter
was
sitting
close
to
me
on
the
old
smiler
is
going
to
see
what
that
other
chap
is
made
of
he
said
pointing
to
the
faint
glimmer
a
half
a
mile
or
so
down
the
wind
the
last
instructions
i
had
received
on
leaving
the
were
if
i
took
the
vessel
successfully
to
douse
all
lights
make
off
to
the
eastward
for
an
hour
and
then
crack
on
all
sail
holding
a
course
that
would
carry
me
as
i
was
told
clear
of
lizard
head
and
out
into
the
atlantic
where
gorham
would
try
to
pick
me
up
the
men
of
their
own
accord
were
taking
quick
short
strokes
with
no
noise
in
the
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
under
the
stern
of
the
vessel
that
i
made
out
to
be
a
brig
as
gorham
said
the
breeze
was
much
lighter
than
it
had
been
and
we
swung
under
the
stern
and
backed
up
to
her
the
better
to
run
away
if
necessary
and
took
in
our
oars
quietly
without
any
danger
of
capsizing
the
man
in
the
stern
caught
the
chains
that
run
down
to
the
rudder
and
whispered
back
all
well
i
stood
up
and
straining
my
eyes
saw
that
within
reach
of
a
man
hand
overhead
was
a
row
of
four
cabin
windows
the
middle
one
was
open
illustration
i
caught
the
combing
of
the
window
and
wormed
myself
inside
thinking
that
it
befitted
my
position
best
to
be
the
first
on
board
i
got
to
my
feet
and
then
by
standing
on
the
shoulders
of
the
two
men
on
the
afterthwart
i
caught
the
combing
of
the
window
and
wormed
myself
inside
i
could
see
that
i
was
in
a
cabin
that
a
dim
light
came
from
a
lantern
hanging
in
a
passageway
forward
but
my
heart
almost
stood
still
after
a
tremendous
thump
against
my
ribs
not
more
than
an
from
me
i
heard
the
sound
of
heavy
breathing
i
had
unshipped
my
cutlass
to
make
my
entrance
more
easy
and
now
i
drew
the
pistol
from
my
belt
and
stood
there
peering
to
one
side
with
every
muscle
stiff
as
a
the
deep
breathing
went
on
without
an
interruption
to
be
continued
the

of
torpedoes
in

how
they
are
made
and
what
they
do
by
franklin
matthews
the
most
dreaded
implement
of
war
in
these
days
is
the
torpedo
one
of
these
darting
fishes
of
death
costing
a
little
more
than
can
almost
instantly
send
the
most
powerful
costing
as
much
as
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
this
shark
of
war
has
a
destructive
charge
of
guncotton
in
its
nose
when
it
strikes
the
it
destroys
itself
and
the
ship
also
no
ship
has
ever
been
built
stout
enough
to
withstand
an
attack
by
one
of
these
artificial
monsters
of
the
sea
they
are
made
to
leap
from
the
side
of
a
vessel
into
the
water
and
after
they
are
once
released
they
go
with
the
speed
of
an
express
train
to
the
place
where
they
are
aimed
to
go
they
propel
themselves
through
the
water
and
they
keep
exactly
at
a
depth
which
is
fixed
before
they
are
fired
nowadays
they
dive
from
the
ship
into
the
water
it
is
probable
that
soon
they
will
be
sent
into
the
water
below
the
surface
and
out
of
sight
of
the
enemy
then
no
captain
of
a
ship
in
battle
will
know
when
to
expect
an
attack
by
a
torpedo
and
perhaps
when
he
fancies
that
he
has
beaten
his
enemy
and
has
the
other
ship
at
his
mercy
a
torpedo
may
be
darting
at
him
unseen
and
unerring
in
its
track
that
will
send
him
and
his
ship
to
the
bottom
before
any
one
on
board
can
save
himself
illustration
a
controllable
torpedo
in
action
torpedoes
are
of
two
general
kinds
one
is
the
automobile
type
and
the
other
is
the
controllable
type
the
first
goes
its
own
way
that
is
controls
itself
the
second
may
be
steered
or
controlled
from
the
place
of
its
discharge
this
country
and
most
other
countries
use
the
automobile
torpedoes
and
we
have
two
kinds
of
them
one
is
the
whitehead
torpedo
and
the
other
is
the
howell
the
whitehead
is
practically
a
submarine
boat
intended
to
destroy
itself
and
anything
else
it
hits
after
a
limited
run
under
the
water
it
has
its
own
engine
for
propulsion
and
uses
compressed
air
as
the
motive
power
the
howell
is
also
intended
to
cause
as
much
destruction
as
the
whitehead
and
is
also
a
submarine
vessel
it
is
propelled
by
the
rotation
of
a
centrifugal
wheel
which
has
been
turned
by
machinery
up
to
about
revolutions
as
this
wheel
unwinds
itself
so
to
speak
it
sets
the
machinery
of
the
torpedo
in
motion
and
it
goes
on
its
errand
of
destruction
the
whitehead
is
a
foreign
invention
and
the
howell
is
the
invention
of
one
of
our
own
naval
officers
this
government
has
favored
the
whitehead
for
the
equipment
of
most
of
the
ships
of
the
navy
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
article
we
may
take
that
as
a
type
these
torpedoes
require
as
much
delicacy
in
their
manufacture
as
a
watch
they
are
boats
and
must
be
fashioned
in
their
outlines
so
as
to
glide
through
the
water
without
the
slightest
deviation
any
inequality
of
shape
would
send
a
torpedo
flying
off
in
some
other
direction
than
that
in
which
it
was
intended
it
should
go
inside
the
complex
machinery
must
act
as
accurately
as
the
machinery
of
a
watch
or
the
torpedo
will
fail
of
its
purpose
it
would
be
tiresome
to
go
into
the
full
details
of
the
machinery
of
a
torpedo
and
besides
it
is
practically
a
government
secret
but
we
may
tell
about
the
general
features
of
these
engines
of
war
illustration
a
whitehead
torpedo
the
whitehead
torpedo
consists
of
several
parts
the
first
is
the
head
where
the
guncotton
is
placed
for
explosion
this
part
is
what
is
called
ogival
in
shape
and
is
bluntly
rounded
then
comes
quite
a
long
straight
part
that
is
the
chamber
for
the
compressed
air
then
there
is
what
is
called
a
buoyancy
chamber
in
which
is
placed
the
diving
apparatus
then
follows
the
to
which
the
water
is
admitted
through
little
slits
in
the
torpedo
then
comes
another
buoyancy
chamber
in
which
the
important
parts
of
the
steering
apparatus
are
placed
and
then
comes
the
tail
with
its
two
screws
and
rudders
and
fins
the
of
the
torpedoes
of
the
largest
size
contain
pounds
of
guncotton
most
of
this
guncotton
is
kept
in
a
damp
condition
the
rest
is
dry
the
dry
guncotton
is
exploded
by
a
small
charge
of
fulminate
of
mercury
and
that
in
turn
explodes
the
wet
guncotton
about
the
only
thing
that
will
explode
wet
guncotton
is
dry
guncotton
the
of
the
torpedoes
are
so
arranged
that
until
they
travel
at
least
eighty
yards
from
a
ship
the
firing
apparatus
is
locked
this
saves
the
ship
from
being
destroyed
by
its
own
weapon
in
case
of
accident
when
the
nose
of
the
strikes
an
object
it
pushes
a
pin
through
a
copper
partition
into
the
fulminate
of
mercury
and
the
explosion
follows
the
torpedo
consists
of
forged
steel
about
an
inch
thick
it
must
be
very
strong
for
it
must
be
charged
with
compressed
air
to
a
pressure
of
pounds
to
the
square
inch
expensive
machinery
is
used
in
finishing
off
this
part
of
the
torpedo
the
lathes
that
work
on
the
inside
can
produce
steel
shavings
of
the
thickness
of
a
thousandth
of
an
inch
the
long
of
the
torpedo
is
made
of
thin
steel
but
strongly
braced
so
that
the
machinery
can
do
its
work
we
probably
can
best
understand
how
these
little
ships
are
made
by
studying
what
they
do
suppose
the
wants
to
sink
an
antagonist
in
war
the
is
set
at
work
a
torpedo
is
swung
on
a
rack
and
lowered
to
a
tube
in
the
side
of
the
ship
and
slid
in
place
a
valve
is
attached
to
an
opening
in
the
torpedo
and
the
air
is
compressed
into
the
by
means
of
a
measuring
device
the
observer
has
fixed
the
exact
time
and
direction
when
to
discharge
the
torpedo
so
as
to
hit
the
enemy
four
ounces
of
powder
have
been
inserted
in
the
back
of
the
torpedo
and
the
word
to
fire
is
given
by
a
simple
arrangement
the
are
closed
the
machinery
in
the
torpedo
unlocked
so
that
after
it
strikes
the
water
the
air
will
flow
into
the
engine
and
start
the
screws
going
the
gauges
and
springs
have
also
been
so
arranged
that
the
torpedo
will
remain
at
a
fixed
depth
with
a
speed
of
about
a
mile
in
two
minutes
the
torpedo
rushes
through
the
water
if
it
strikes
the
enemy
a
great
naval
catastrophe
happens
if
it
misses
it
is
so
arranged
as
to
sink
after
it
has
spent
its
force
and
to
disappear
out
of
the
way
of
doing
harm
to
shipping
if
practice
work
is
being
done
with
the
torpedo
at
any
time
the
mechanism
is
so
arranged
beforehand
that
when
the
torpedo
has
run
its
course
it
rises
to
the
surface
and
is
recovered
how
does
a
torpedo
keep
at
a
certain
distance
under
water
well
there
are
two
bits
of
machinery
to
accomplish
that
one
is
a
pendulum
if
the
nose
of
the
torpedo
raises
itself
the
pendulum
swings
backward
and
depresses
the
rudders
at
the
stern
and
brings
down
the
nose
if
the
torpedo
begins
to
dive
the
pendulum
moves
forward
and
the
opposite
result
follows
the
torpedo
remains
at
the
required
depth
through
the
pressure
of
the
water
that
comes
into
the
on
a
rubber
diaphragm
to
which
is
attached
a
delicate
spring
the
pressure
of
the
water
and
the
strength
of
the
spring
offset
each
other
when
the
torpedo
is
at
the
depth
wanted
if
the
torpedo
sinks
or
rises
the
harmony
between
the
spring
and
the
pressure
of
water
is
disturbed
and
the
is
affected
and
the
rudders
moved
so
as
to
keep
the
weapon
at
a
certain
depth
slight
changes
up
or
down
are
regulated
by
this
machinery
but
if
the
plunge
or
rise
is
of
a
serious
nature
the
pendulum
begins
to
swing
and
the
torpedo
corrects
its
course
at
once
another
most
delicate
part
of
the
torpedo
machinery
is
what
is
called
a
valve
group
this
is
a
set
of
valves
used
for
various
purposes
the
chief
of
which
is
to
restrain
violent
action
from
the
compressed
air
during
changes
in
direction
of
the
little
craft
or
during
its
run
they
have
such
names
as
the
controlling
valve
the
reducing
valve
the
regulating
valve
the
flow
of
air
into
the
little
engine
must
be
constant
and
of
a
certain
pressure
the
screws
at
the
stern
of
the
boat
must
be
turned
at
the
rate
of
about
one
thousand
revolutions
a
minute
and
the
control
of
the
force
that
propels
them
must
be
most
efficient
another
piece
of
important
machinery
is
known
as
the
locking
gear
when
a
torpedo
is
shot
into
the
water
from
a
ship
the
pendulum
may
lag
a
little
in
its
swing
forward
this
would
put
the
rudder
down
and
make
the
torpedo
take
a
deep
dive
in
shallow
water
this
might
mean
contact
with
the
bottom
and
of
course
that
would
never
do
the
locking
gear
prevents
any
action
by
the
rudder
until
the
torpedo
has
travelled
about
a
hundred
yards
by
that
time
the
craft
has
settled
to
its
work
and
has
ceased
to
make
any
skipping
motions
in
the
water
thus
we
see
that
the
torpedo
is
not
ready
for
full
duty
until
it
has
gone
a
considerable
distance
from
the
ship
it
can
not
explode
nor
steer
itself
until
it
is
darting
through
the
water
under
its
own
power
at
a
certain
depth
and
at
a
certain
speed
if
it
does
the
work
expected
of
it
it
will
strike
its
target
in
probably
less
than
one
minute
it
therefore
does
appalling
destruction
in
almost
an
instant
illustration
torpedo
and
launching
tube
the
reason
that
there
are
two
screws
at
the
stern
is
to
make
sure
of
propelling
the
torpedo
in
a
straight
line
one
screw
turns
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
left
the
tendency
to
go
to
the
right
or
left
which
would
occur
if
there
were
only
one
screw
is
thus
equalized
the
fin
part
of
the
tail
also
serves
to
keep
the
torpedo
on
a
straight
course
there
is
a
great
deal
of
variety
in
the
machinery
which
is
crowded
into
one
of
these
torpedoes
but
with
that
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
there
is
almost
as
much
delicate
machinery
necessary
to
place
the
torpedoes
in
the
water
as
to
keep
them
going
after
they
get
into
the
water
the
launching
tube
and
look
like
simple
affairs
but
in
reality
they
have
to
be
adjusted
most
delicately
and
most
carefully
to
the
torpedoes
great
care
is
bestowed
not
only
on
this
machinery
on
shipboard
but
also
on
the
torpedoes
the
torpedoes
are
smothered
with
grease
and
every
precaution
is
taken
to
prevent
rust
from
accumulating
in
any
spot
outside
or
inside
every
torpedo
is
tested
most
thoroughly
before
it
is
accepted
by
the
government
and
a
careful
record
is
kept
of
the
performance
of
each
in
practice
on
the
ship
to
which
it
is
sent
no
one
knows
the
full
power
of
one
of
these
missiles
in
recent
times
two
large
the
in
the
brazilian
civil
war
and
the
in
the
war
were
sunk
by
torpedoes
several
smaller
craft
were
sent
to
the
bottom
in
the
war
between
china
and
japan
when
we
think
of
their
power
of
destruction
and
the
extreme
care
and
skill
required
to
make
them
it
seems
wonderful
that
such

everybody
has
seen
rolling
their
balls
along
some
path
or
highway
in
the
country
but
few
people
are
aware
that
these
little
insects
are
the
lineal
descendants
so
to
speak
of
a
deity
the
sacred
scarabæus
of
the
egyptians
of
which
we
have
read
so
much
the
little
fellows
in
seeming
indifference
to
their
fall
from
high
estate
are
still
rolling
their
balls
as
industriously
as
they
did
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
in
moses
time
the
coleoptera
or
beetles
form
the
highest
division
of
insects
they
all
have
six
legs
and
a
distinctly
marked
head
thorax
and
abdomen
the
body
is
covered
with
a
horny
envelope
which
takes
the
place
of
the
skeleton
in
higher
creatures
protecting
and
holding
the
organs
in
place
the
beetle
has
also
four
wings
one
pair
over
the
other
the
lower
ones
are
of
a
parchmentlike
substance
while
the
upper
ones
are
horny
beetles
are
of
various
kinds
some
of
which
are
useful
to
man
and
others
harmful
belong
to
the
former
class
and
no
one
variety
is
more
interesting
than
the
or
this
little
fellow
of
one
species
or
another
is
found
all
over
the
united
states
in
europe
and
in
northern
africa
with
us
he
is
from
half
to
of
an
inch
in
length
and
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
and
one
which
excites
the
curiosity
of
every
one
who
observes
them
is
the
manner
in
which
the
egg
is
developed
into
the
perfect
insect
this
egg
is
laid
in
manure
which
is
mixed
with
a
little
clay
and
then
rolled
into
a
ball
about
the
size
of
a
marble
and
left
to
dry
for
the
work
that
is
to
follow
the
powerful
legs
and
jaws
of
the
insect
are
well
adapted
no
better
proof
of
its
strength
may
be
obtained
than
by
putting
one
or
two
bugs
under
a
candlestick
on
a
table
and
noticing
the
ease
with
which
they
move
it
along
when
the
ball
is
dry
the
bugs
usually
two
in
number
commence
rolling
it
to
a
suitable
place
of
deposit
which
is
not
apparently
selected
in
advance
whether
these
two
bugs
are
the
parents
or
not
is
unknown
but
at
any
rate
one
places
himself
in
the
front
with
his
hind
feet
on
the
ground
and
the
others
on
the
ball
while
the
other
goes
in
the
rear
with
his
body
reversed
that
is
his
four
front
legs
are
planted
firmly
on
the
ground
with
his
head
bent
low
in
the
dust
while
his
hinder
parts
are
raised
high
on
the
ball
which
he
pushes
with
the
two
remaining
legs
and
the
extremity
of
the
body
the
duty
of
the
bug
in
front
seems
to
be
either
to
guide
the
ball
or
to
pull
it
forward
possibly
both
although
he
has
the
most
natural
position
and
seems
to
have
less
to
do
than
the
other
bug
he
really
has
the
harder
time
for
when
the
ball
gets
rolling
down
a
slope
it
frequently
goes
over
him
entirely
or
pushes
him
sprawling
by
the
but
he
is
soon
on
his
feet
again
and
scrambling
into
place
makes
believe
he
is
having
the
jolliest
time
in
the
world
if
obstructions
occur
in
the
path
the
is
not
easily
discouraged
you
may
frighten
him
away
or
even
push
him
aside
with
your
stick
but
if
you
keep
quiet
for
a
few
moments
he
will
return
to
his
work
if
a
tuft
of
grass
or
a
stone
intervene
he
leaves
his
work
and
goes
in
search
of
help
and
his
comrades
rarely
fail
to
respond
if
however
after
repeated
efforts
to
move
it
the
bugs
leave
their
ball
in
despair
it
often
happens
that
a
new
party
comes
across
it
and
rolls
it
merrily
to
its
destination
the
whole
community
seem
to
take
an
interest
in
every
ball
and
are
willing
to
do
their
utmost
to
help
it
along
when
a
suitable
place
is
found
which
may
be
several
yards
from
where
the
ball
was
made
one
bug
remains
with
it
while
the
other
excavates
a
little
hole
for
its
reception
when
the
hole
is
about
the
depth
of
the
ball
the
latter
is
rolled
in
and
then
both
bugs
get
underneath
and
while
they
are
excavating
and
pushing
the
dirt
one
side
the
ball
gradually
follows
them
downward
sinking
by
its
own
weight
this
hole
is
sometimes
two
or
three
feet
deep
when
the
egg
hatches
the
larva
or
grub
lives
upon
the
contents
of
the
ball
until
the
supply
of
food
is
exhausted
when
it
makes
its
way
to
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
there
by
some
unknown
process
forms
and
places
itself
inside
a
cocoon
of
oval
shape
and
of
similar
composition
to
the
ball
in
which
it
was
hatched
there
it
silently
changes
into
a
chrysalis
and
emerges
a
perfect
insect
besides
the
little
that
we
most
commonly
see
there
is
a
larger
species
found
in
this
country
and
in
england
called
the
clock
or
door
beetle
and
which
is
alluded
to
by
shakespeare
where
macbeth
says
ere
to
black
hecate
summons
the
beetle
with
his
drowsy
hums
hath
rung
night
yawning
peal
shard
was
the
old
english
name
of
the
horny
outer
wing
of
the
beetle
another
old
english
writer
quaintly
commends
the
as
an
example
of
labor
temperance
prudence
justice
modesty
and
contentment
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
he
arrived
at
the
idea
of
making
the
the
symbol
of
justice
perhaps
he
thought
a
bug
having
so
many
other
virtues
would
have
that
one
of
necessity
a
species
of
was
also
sacred
to
thor
in
the
old
days
when
that
god
was
worshipped
in
gothland
or
scandinavia
when
the
christian
missionaries
came
into
the
land
they
changed
the
name
of
the
bug
from
thor
bug
to
in
order
to
turn
the
minds
of
the
people
from
its
worship
the
latter
name
still
survives
in
sweden
but
many
a
peasant
with
the
blood
of
his
superstitious
ancestors
still
in
his
veins
will
even
now
set
the
on
his
feet
when
he
sees
him
sprawling
on
his
back
and
congratulate
himself
that
he
has
brought
luck
to
his
undertakings
the
sacred
beetle
of
the
egyptians
was
considered
to
symbolize
the
sun
the
world
or
habitable
globe
and
the
goddess
neith
many
explanations
are
offered
to
account
for
the
origin
of
this
belief
but
the
most
plausible
are
the
following
the
beetle
represented
the
sun
because
its
antennæ
or
feelers
diverge
from
the
head
like
the
rays
of
the
sun
then
again
its
six
legs
have
five
joints
each
thirty
in
all
equal
to
the
number
of
days
in
a
month
or
in
a
sign
of
the
zodiac
the
beetle
represented
the
world
because
it
rolled
balls
or
little
orbs
these
balls
were
fabled
to
be
rolled
from
sunrise
till
sunset
and
always
in
the
same
direction
as
the
earth
the
goddess
neith
was
the
supreme
power
in
governing
the
works
of
creation
the
warrior
in
going
forth
to
battle
would
have
the
sacred
beetle
carved
or
painted
on
ring
or
bracelet
to
propitiate
the
goddess
and
make
him
victorious
the
explanation
offered
is
that
as
the
male
and
female
were
so
hard
to
distinguish
they
were
all
thought
to
be
males
and
therefore
of
great
courage
plutarch
tells
us
that
the
romans
adopted
the
beetle
as
a
sign
of
victory
and
had
it
represented
on
the
standards
of
their
legions
the
accommodating
island
one
of
the
old
sailor
yarns
by
henderson
it
was
a
southeasterly
morning
before
a
rainy
day
the
world
was
a
palette
of
grays
greens
and
purples
with
here
and
there
a
bright
flash
of
where
the
sun
rays
fell
through
a
rift
in
the
shifting
clouds
and
touched
the
young
grass
the
sea
was
a
patterned
with
dark
wrinkles
and
white
scars
of
foam
there
was
yet
no
swell
for
only
a
fresh
breeze
was
blowing
and
the
sea
had
not
made
up
the
sky
was
a
vast
tangle
of
gray
and
clouds
varying
in
shape
from
long
wisps
through
smokelike
tufts
down
to
the
verge
of
the
southerly
horizon
where
there
was
a
solid
sheet
of
that
hazy
blue
which
marks
the
presence
of
rain
the
clam
fleet
was
galloping
homeward
with
lifted
sheets
and
bellying
jibs
the
fishermen
were
holding
on
till
the
last
minute
with
their
light
anchors
down
in
six
fathoms
of
water
and
their
green
dancing
on
the
young
windrows
of
salt
spume
a
nova
scotia
bark
and
was
going
out
in
tow
of
a
squat
and
puffy
tug
the
bark
had
all
her
staysails
set
and
two
or
three
hands
were
aloft
loosing
the
topsails
after
the
manner
of
men
to
whom
a
month
more
or
less
on
a
voyage
is
not
to
be
considered
the
old
sailor
sat
on
the
end
of
the
pier
and
gazed
at
the
bark
ever
and
anon
he
bowed
his
head
and
shook
with
one
of
his
hearty
fits
of
silent
laughter
henry
and
george
were
standing
on
the
shore
opposite
the
pier
and
they
were
certain
that
the
bark
had
reminded
their
old
friend
of
something
interesting
so
they
walked
out
on
the
pier
and
sat
down
beside
him
here
we
are
said
henry
yes
here
we
are
added
george
the
same
bein
here
said
the
old
sailor
gravely
it
are
necessitous
fur
me
to
recommember
somethin
he
paused
for
a
moment
gazed
at
the
bark
and
said
way
are
the
wind
southeast
replied
george
about
said
henry
werry
good
werry
good
indeed
declared
the
old
sailor
emphatically
my
son
you
grow
up
to
be
a
man
the
same
you
are
of
at
the
rate
o
twelve
knots

almost
a
good
enough
sailor
fur
to
sail
a
i
knowed
ossifers
in
the
navy
as
could
do
again
the
old
sailor
paused
and
looked
at
the
bark
and
henry
was
moved
to
say
does
she
remind
you
of
anything
she
do
answered
the
old
sailor
she
reminds
me
o
the
iron
bark

the
golf
course
at
the
hotchkiss
school
lakeville
is
somewhat
more
extended
than
that
at
lawrenceville
described
in
these
columns
last
week
a
glance
at
the
map
on
the
next
page
will
show
that
it
is
also
somewhat
more
complicated
the
first
hole
however
is
a
comparatively
easy
one
for
a
good
player
although
the
inexperienced
golfer
will
find
the
swamp
and
the
brook
somewhat
unpleasant
obstacles
the
second
hole
has
only
one
hazard
a
brook
near
the
which
ought
to
be
cleared
easily
on
the
drive
since
it
is
on
a
considerably
lower
level
the
third
hole
requires
a
sure
drive
on
account
of
the
zigzag
wooden
fence
which
runs
along
almost
parallel
with
the
course
on
the
left
and
frequently
proves
an
unpleasant
hazard
for
the
novice
the
fourth
hole
is
on
the
top
of
a
knoll
and
a
drive
that
is
either
too
hard
or
too
short
will
drop
the
ball
in
a
bad
position
illustration
the
hotchkiss
school
golf
course
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
holes
rises
a
large
rock
but
this
is
not
so
bad
an
obstacle
as
might
be
supposed
and
may
be
driven
over
by
any
one
with
a
little
experience
at
the
game
on
the
sixth
hole
there
is
a
deep
ditch
or
excavation
which
was
made
by
the
removal
of
some
sand
and
the
ball
that
drops
into
this
pit
will
cause
the
player
to
spend
a
considerable
number
of
strokes
to
get
it
out
the
putting
green
for
this
hole
is
on
the
top
of
a
rocky
mountain
and
is
very
hard
of
approach
for
when
a
ball
hits
a
rocky
side
of
the
elevation
it
bounds
back
to
a
good
distance
the
seventh
hole
is
an
easy
one
the
only
obstacle
being
a
mound
with
a
small
ditch
back
of
it
the
most
difficult
hole
on
the
whole
course
however
is
the
eighth
one
of
the
principal
dangers
is
that
of
going
over
the
fence
to
the
left
and
there
is
also
the
chance
of
going
over
the
fence
which
lies
to
the
right
as
the
hole
itself
lies
in
a
small
lane
between
the
two
and
consequently
considerable
skill
is
necessary
to
place
the
ball
in
the
proper
position
the
last
hole
is
by
no
means
an
easy
one
either
inasmuch
as
there
are
a
fence
at
the
start
a
brook
just
this
side
of
the
green
and
a
swamp
on
the
further
side
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
interest
displayed
in
golf
at
hotchkiss
during
the
past
year
and
a
large
number
of
the
students
have
taken
up
the
game
with
energy
some
good
scores
have
been
made
over
the
course
and
doubtless
next
spring
there
will
be
a
tournament
to
settle
the
championship
of
the
school
athletics
seem
to
be
taking
a
new
lease
of
life
in
chicago
and
the
sportsmen
are
developing
an
unusually
clean
and
healthy
spirit
the
greatest
evidence
of
which
is
their
determination
to
overcome
all
the
obstacles
that
lie
in
their
way
and
to
try
to
do
the
best
they
can
with
such
advantages
as
they
have
the
schoolboys
made
an
application
to
the
authorities
of
the
university
of
chicago
for
the
use
of
the
college
gymnasium
but
as
this
has
been
refused
a
number
of
the
schools
have
had
to
look
elsewhere
for
training
quarters
the
englewood
athletes
have
announced
philosophically
that
they
will
do
as
they
did
two
years
ago
that
is
they
will
train
out
in
the
street
if
they
can
not
get
any
other
place
this
is
made
necessary
because
englewood
has
no
gymnasium
or
any
room
in
the
school
that
can
be
used
as
such
hyde
park
has
without
exception
the
best
school
gymnasium
in
the
west
and
will
therefore
probably
not
feel
the
deprivation
of
being
forbidden
the
university
gymnasium
so
much
as
will
some
of
the
other
schools
the
hyde
park
gymnasium
is
not
by
any
means
large
but
it
is
well
equipped
and
has
an
excellent
running
track
south
division
will
have
to
follow
englewood
heroic
example
by
resorting
to
the
public
streets
for
training
quarters
and
mighty
lively
training
quarters
will
they
have
for
two
of
the
streets
bounding
the
block
on
which
the
school
is
located
have
street
railways
running
through
them
and
tracks
are
about
to
be
laid
through
the
street
on
which
the
faces
the
pupils
of
the
school
have
gotten
up
a
petition
which
has
been
sent
to
the
board
begging
that
a
new
more
favorably
located
and
with
greater
conveniences
including
a
gymnasium
of
course
be
provided
for
them
in
regard
to
the
facilities
that
the
boys
of
chicago
have
for
athletics
it
is
to
be
noted
that
a
great
many
students
who
have
gone
out
from
the
south
division
to
other
schools
have
won
distinction
on
the
teams
of
the
latter
whereas
the
south
division
teams
very
seldom
achieve
any
success
in
athletics
the
general
opinion
consequently
is
that
owing
to
the
lack
of
facilities
and
advantages
offered
to
the
students
of
south
division
the
teams
which
represent
the
school
are
not
nearly
so
good
as
they
might
be
under
other
circumstances
what
prompted
the
to
petition
the
authorities
of
the
university
for
the
use
of
the
gymnasium
this
year
was
that
last
year
the
schoolboys
were
allowed
to
train
there
between
the
hours
of
two
and
four
in
the
afternoon
and
a
large
number
of
young
athletes
from
hyde
park
englewood
south
division
chicago
manual
and
even
from
lake
view
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
of
working
there
and
as
a
result
the
athletic
teams
the
next
spring
were
all
of
an
unusually
high
standard
the
reason
given
by
the
university
of
chicago
for
refusing
the
use
of
the
gymnasium
to
the
schools
this
year
is
that
there
was
too
much
crowding
on
the
track
by
the
runners
and
that
the
galleries
were
kept
too
full
of
spectators
this
is
a
very
good
reason
of
course
but
it
would
seem
nevertheless
that
if
the
gymnasium
was
given
up
to
the
schools
entirely
between
the
hours
of
two
and
four
it
could
make
no
difference
to
the
college
men
how
much
the
school
athletes
crowded
one
another
on
the
track
nor
how
many
of
their
fellows
congregated
in
the
galleries
to
watch
them
i
can
readily
understand
however
that
if
the
gymnasium
was
not
entirely
given
up
to
the
lads
if
the
college
men
intended
to
use
the
track
and
the
floor
at
the
same
time
there
would
naturally
be
a
good
deal
of
crowding
and
the
vigorous
methods
of
the
younger
athletes
would
probably
prove
annoying
to
those
who
considered
that
the
youngsters
were
intruders
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
there
should
be
no
business
that
is
if
the
boys
are
to
have
the
use
of
the
gymnasium
they
should
have
the
unrestricted
use
of
it
and
the
college
men
should
keep
away
during
those
hours
if
however
the
college
men
honestly
believe
that
there
is
not
time
enough
for
all
the
college
athletes
to
train
and
at
the
same
time
allow
the
schoolboys
to
use
the
floor
for
a
certain
period
each
day
they
are
fully
justified
in
refusing
the
use
of
their
gymnasium
it
is
to
be
regretted
however
that
some
kind
of
an
arrangement
can
not
be
made
for
the
boys
for
the
college
men
must
remember
that
by
developing
the
young
athletes
they
are
bringing
up
material
that
will
eventually
go
into
the
university
teams
and
prove
of
the
greatest
value
and
usefulness
to
them
the
of
the
long
island
association
for
the
championship
of
the
league
have
been
postponed
and
will
now
not
be
held
until
possibly
the
first
or
second
week
in
march
they
will
be
held
in
the
clermont
avenue
rink
brooklyn
and
the
events
to
be
contested
are
dash
and
and
races
at
the
boston
meeting
a
week
ago
saturday
there
was
a
number
of
interscholastic
entries
and
several
of
the
schoolboys
did
good
work
there
was
a
novice
race
in
the
final
heat
of
which
was
jones
of
exeter
the
final
heat
was
so
close
that
the
judges
were
unable
to
decide
upon
the
winner
and
it
was
necessary
to
run
it
off
again
on
the
last
attempt
jones
won

was

the

started
off
quickly

for

laps

led
the
field

good
second

then
hit
up
the
pace

on

it
was
not

managed
to

by

of
andover
with

of

second
there
is
excellent
material
among
the
boston
schools
this
year
and
the
interscholastic
games
ought
to
be
the
occasion
of
some
the
national
interscholastic
games
which
were
held
at
the
columbia
oval
last
june
were
a
success
so
far
as
they
could
be
when
one
considers
all
the
disadvantages
that
the
managers
had
to
contend
against
that
was
the
first
year
of
the
association
existence
and
the
officers
naturally
had
a
great
deal
more
work
to
do
than
they
ever
will
have
again
and
a
great
many
questions
to
decide
at
short
notice
without
any
experience
to
assist
them
toward
these
decisions
several
of
the
present
officers
of
the
association
were
connected
with
the
management
of
the
games
last
year
and
they
consequently
know
of
several
things
that
must
be
avoided
and
of
many
others
that
should
be
looked
after
it
is
none
too
early
now
to
begin
to
make
plans
for
these
games
one
of
the
difficulties
last
year
was
that
there
was
hardly
time
enough
to
do
all
that
should
have
been
done
to
make
the
games
a
striking
success
another
trouble
was
that
so
many
of
the
games
of
the
various
interscholastic
associations
were
scheduled
for
so
late
a
date
that
the
national
games
had
to
be
postponed
until
june
in
order
not
to
conflict
with
the
other
contests
it
seems
to
me
that
a
good
thing
to
do
this
year
and
it
ought
to
be
done
as
soon
as
possible
would
be
for
the
executive
committee
of
the
national
association
to
meet
and
decide
upon
a
conditional
date
for
the
national
games
the
secretaries
of
all
the
interscholastic
associations
of
the
country
or
of
all
those
that
will
probably
send
teams
to
the
national
games
should
be
informed
of
this
proposed
date
and
the
request
should
be
made
to
them
that
their
own
games
be
held
at
least
a
week
previous
to
the
national
event
it
is
more
than
probable
that
every
association
would
endeavor
if
it
were
a
possible
thing
to
concede
this
much
to
the
national
association
and
to
hold
their
local
games
at
a
date
that
would
not
conflict
with
the
general
event
in
new
york
the
interscholastic
games
are
held
early
in
the
month
of
may
the
long
island
league
follows
about
a
week
later
but
in
boston
as
well
as
in
philadelphia
and
in
the
maine
association
the
spring
games
usually
come
in
the
first
week
in
june
it
is
at
just
about
that
time
that
it
would
seem
to
me
the
national
association
would
wish
to
have
the
big
games
in
new
york
these
contests
to
be
successful
should
be
scheduled
so
that
they
would
not
interfere
with
the
college
examinations
and
also
so
that
they
would
not
come
too
early
in
the
season
for
the
contestants
in
order
not
to
interfere
with
the
examinations
they
ought
not
to
be
held
any
later
than
the
first
week
in
june
for
the
young
men
who
participate
in
the
games
will
need
two
or
three
weeks
at
least
after
the
meeting
to
devote
entirely
to
their
studies
in
order
to
gain
the
and
obtain
the
support
of
the
older
heads
the
managers
should
do
all
they
can
to
arrange
matters
so
that
the
games
will
not
interfere
with
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
interfere
with
if
properly
managed
the
objection
has
been
made
that
the
national
games
added
one
more
occasion
to
the
many
that
already
take
up
the
time
of
the
schoolboy
athletes
this
is
perhaps
true
for
the
present
but
i
doubt
if
next
year
or
thereafter
it
would
be
the
case
because
as
soon
as
the
schools
become
convinced
that
the
national
games
are
to
be
the
most
important
of
the
year
so
far
as
scholastic
athletics
are
concerned
the
games
of
the
several
interscholastic
associations
will
take
a
secondary
position
and
the
school
games
of
the
institutions
making
up
the
interscholastic
associations
will
fall
into
a
third
stage
of
importance
and
probably
fall
away
entirely
in
other
words
instead
of
having
a
series
of
school
games
leading
up
to
the
interscholastic
games
of
the
several
leagues
in
various
parts
of
the
country
the
schoolboy
athletes
will
look
upon
their
interscholastic
meeting
as
a
sort

for
the
national

instead
of
as
they
have
heretofore
a
final

to
decide
the

of

the
mere
fact
that
at
the
national

the
best
athletes
of
the
great

will
be
pitted
against
one
another
is
sufficient
to
make
that

the
most
interesting
and
beyond
any
question
the
most
important
of
the
year
i
do
not
believe
that
there
should
be
so
many
meetings
as
there
have
been
in
the
past
i
mean
that
i
think
it
is
a
poor
plan
to
have
scholastic
meetings
open
to
members
of
schools
belonging
to
the
interscholastic
league
for
the
result
soon
comes
to
be
that
each
scholastic
meeting
is
practically
an
interscholastic
event
and
this
may
easily
be
seen
by
looking
at
the
list
of
entries
at
these
various
scholastic
games
the
best
plan
is
to
have
each
league
hold
its
meeting
pick
the
first
two
men
for
a
team
to
represent
that
league
at
the
national
games
and
then
let
the
national
games
be
the
decisive
contest

one
summer
morning
shortly
after
the
close
of
the
civil
war
the
not
unusual
sight
in
washington
of
an
old
veteran
hobbling
along
could
have
been
seen
on
a
shady
path
that
led
from
the
executive
mansion
to
the
war
office
the
old
man
was
in
pain
and
the
pale
sunken
cheeks
and
vague
stare
in
his
eyes
betokened
a
existence
he
halted
a
moment
and
then
slowly
approached
a
tall
gentleman
who
was
walking
thoughtfully
along
sir
i
an
old
soldier
and
would
like
to
ask
your
advice
the
gentleman
turned
and
smiling
kindly
invited
the
poor
old
veteran
to
a
seat
under
a
shady
tree
there
he
listened
to
the
man
story
of
how
he
had
fought
for
the
union
and
was
severely
wounded
incapacitating
him
for
other
work
in
life
and
begged
directions
how
to
apply
for
back
pay
due
him
and
a
pension
offering
his
papers
for
examination
the
gentleman
looked
over
the
papers
and
then
took
out
a
card
and
wrote
directions
on
it
also
a
few
words
to
the
pension
bureau
desiring
that
speedy
attention
be
given
to
the
applicant
and
handed
it
to
him
the
old
soldier
looked
at
it
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
thanked
the
tall
gentleman
who
with
a
sad
look
bade
him
good
luck
and
hurried
up
the
walk
slowly
the
soldier
read
the
card
again
and
then
turned
it
over
to
read
the
name
of
the
owner
more
tears
welled
in
his
eyes
when
he
knew
whom
he
had
addressed
himself
to
and
his
lips
muttered

questions
for
young
men
on
courtesy
to
women
and
girls
somebody
once
said
that
you
could
tell
how
civilized
a
nation
was
at
any
one
time
by
learning
how
that
nation
treated
its
women
at
that
particular
period
you
go
to
some
of
the
towns
in
europe
and
you
find
women
doing
the
hard
labor
drawing
carts
beside
dogs
carrying
bundles
and
heavy
articles
about
go
among
savages
in
africa
and
you
find
women
doing
the
hard
labor
of
life
the
men
reserving
for
themselves
the
hunting
the
loafing
and
the
fighting
as
nations
grow
more
civilized
the
women
become
more
the
objects
of
care
and
solicitude
and
in
england
and
the
united
states
they
are
treated
with
an
amount
of
forethought
and
attention
never
known
before
and
yet
even
in
america
many
a
young
man
who
would
instantly
deny
any
charge
of
discourtesy
to
a
lady
will
do
little
things
half
unconsciously
that
are
neither
courteous
nor
becoming
a
gentleman
this
comment
does
not
refer
to
such
acts
as
taking
off
one
hat
to
every
woman
or
girl
one
knows
nor
to
any
of
the
ordinary
acts
of
politeness
such
are
understood
in
these
days
it
does
refer
however
to
slight
matters
that
mark
the
man
or
boy
who
knows
what
good
manners
are
and
who
invariably
bears
himself
well
in
the
presence
of
others
such
a
boy
never
speaks
to
a
girl
or
woman
if
she
is
standing
without
rising
himself
i
saw
at
a
large
restaurant
a
short
time
ago
a
man
approach
three
women
and
three
men
who
were
eating
supper
no
one
of
the
three
men
knew
the
fourth
personally
but
as
he
approached
and
spoke
to
a
friend
among
the
women
all
three
arose
and
remained
standing
until
the
was
gone
it
was
not
a
mark
of
courtesy
to
the
fourth
man
it
was
a
signification
to
the
three
ladies
that
for
the
time
being
the
new
arrival
was
allowed
the
privilege
of
speaking
to
any
of
them
if
they
chose
to
invite
it
that
is
merely
an
example
of
a
small
point
which
perhaps
was
not
necessary
but
the
action
not
only
pleased
the
women
but
certainly
stamped
the
men
as
gentlemen
many
a
boy
fails
to
rise
from
his
chair
when
his
mother
enters
the
room
while
he
would
get
up
at
once
if
a
stranger
entered
and
one
would
suppose
that
his
mother
who
is
more
to
him
than
the
rest
of
womankind
put
together
should
to
say
the
least
have
from
him
the
same
marks
of
courtesy
as
strangers
in
fact
you
can
tell
a
boy
character
pretty
accurately
by
the
way
in
which
he
treats
his
mother
for
as
a
mother
has
probably
done
and
will
do
more
for
her
son
than
any
other
woman
with
perhaps
one
exception
will
ever
do
so
he
ought
in
return
to
treat
her
as
his
most
valuable
possession
his
courtesy
his
chivalrous
and
knightly
bearing
towards
her
are
never
thrown
away
she
sees
it
all
and
thinks
more
of
it
than
any
one
else
and
he
need
never
fear
that
his
thoughtfulness
is
thrown
away
perhaps
occasionally
such
conduct
may
to
a
certain
extent
go
unnoticed
by
some
other
women
but
by
his
mother
never
in
the
same
way
one
conduct
to
one
sister
is
a
test
of
good
breeding
sisters
are
not
mothers
by
any
means
but
still
they
demand
courtesy
from
their
brothers
perhaps
a
sister
can
be
pretty
hard
to
get
on
with
at
times
but
nevertheless
she
is
a
woman
and
she
can
do
certain
things
without
any
fear
of
retaliation
because
the
nobility
of
the
man
in
the
boy
is
bound
to
respect
the
woman
in
his
sister
let
her
tease
and
tantalize
but
remember
that
the
best
way
to
cure
her
is
to
treat
her
so
like
a
lady
who
could
never
descend
to
such
methods
that
she
will
soon
be
forced
to
stop
in
order
to
live
up
to
the
character
you
have
given
her
mothers
come
first
therefore
over
all
the
world
and
sisters
next
treat
them
as
carefully
with
as
much
thoughtfulness
as
you
do
anything
else
in
your
life
and
with
even
more
care
and
then
we
can
discuss
the
rest
of
womankind
lincoln
and
the
poor
widow
the
of
february
abraham
lincoln
birthday
brings
to
our
thoughts
stronger
than
ever
reminiscences
of
this
noble
man
life
hundreds
of
books
have
recorded
and
will
perpetuate
his
good
deeds
for
centuries
to
come
but
it
is
a
pleasure
to
read
now
and
then
of
some
little
act
of
kindness
that
will
stand
alone
illustrating
the
breadth
of
this
sympathies
and
the
nobility
of
his
character
during
all
that
dreadful
period
when
the
civil
war
was
ravaging
the
country
lincoln
held
the
reins
of
the
government
and
although
worn
out
with
unceasing
toil
he
never
neglected
an
opportunity
to
help
those
who
suffered
one
day
a
poor
woman
whose
tears
had
worn
furrows
down
her
cheeks
gained
an
audience
with
lincoln
and
in
a
few
words
related
the
sad
tale
of
her
husband
who
had
fought
in
the
union
army
only
to
lose
his
life
and
of
her
three
boys
who
were
then
fighting
she
requested
the
discharge
of
her
eldest
boy
that
she
might
have
some
one
to
support
her
lincoln
heart
responded
to
the
appeal
and
he
replied
certainly
if
you
have
given
us
all
and
your
prop
has
been
taken
away
you
are
justly
entitled
to
one
of
your
boys
the
poor
woman
went
away
light
of
heart
only
to
return
later
tearfully
begging
the
release
of
her
second
son
the
discharge
of
the
first
son
had
come
too
late
he
was
killed
before
it
reached
him
sadly
lincoln
sat
down
and
wrote
the
requisite
order
for
the
release
of
the
second
son
and
rising
handed
the
paper
to
the
afflicted
woman
saying
now
you
have
one
and
i
have
one
of
the
two
boys
left
that
is
no
more
than
right
weeping
with
joy
the
poor
mother
blessed

hurried

her
precious

discovery
of
copperplate
engraving
every
one
has
noticed
on
his
the
extremely
delicate
lines
of
his
name
and
most
every
one
knows
that
they
are
produced
by
printing
from
an
engraved
copperplate
like
many
other
things
of
use
and
beauty
this
art
of
copperplate
engraving
was
discovered
through
the
merest
accident
by
the
goldsmiths
of
florence
in
the
fifteenth
century
it
is
a
historical
fact
however
that
one
day
an
engraver
on
gold
wishing
to
take
a
proof
of
his
work
made
the
usual
sulphur
cast
and
then
filled
up
the
lines
with
thus
enabling
him
to
see
exactly
how
his
work
looked
while
occupied
in
doing
this
it
occurred
to
him
that
possibly
the
same
results
could
be
obtained
by
filling
up
the
original
engraving
with
instead
of
making
an
impression
of
it
and
filling
up
that
struck
with
the
idea
he
put
it
into
practical
use
and
with
a
little
damp
paper
succeeded
in
getting
a
fair
impression
from
the
engraving
the
discovery
was
communicated
to
other
workers
in
this
art
and
they
hailed
it
with
joy
as
it
saved
all
the
arduous
trouble
of
making
sulphur
casts
but
they
never
saw
the
full
value
of
the
discovery
and
consequently
the
art
of
lay
for
almost
a
century
before
its
true
import
was
discovered
and
brought
out
in
all
its
great
and
beautiful

is
simply
our
common

but
the
true
philatelist
rejoices
less
in
the
money
value
of
his

in
the
fact
that

years

collecting
began
in
the
almost
every
boy
had
access
to
the
family
letters
or
those
of
some
business
house
the
great
ambition
of
every
boy
was
to
get
more
kinds
than
any
other
boy
of
his
acquaintance
could
boast
stamps
had
little
value
and
many
a
rare
stamp
has
been
traded
for
an
absolutely
worthless
common
stamp
for
instance
the
writer
had
literally
hundreds
of
kreuzer
würtembergs
in
strips
of
three
four
or
five
copies
and
hundreds
of

according

the

standards
and
yet
i
sometimes
think
we
early
collectors
got
a
great
deal
more
pleasure
from
our
stamps
than
the
present
army
of
collectors
even
when
we
got
to
know

the
polite
ghost
once
there
was
a
ghost
there
were
ghosts
once
who
thought
to
see
the
world
of
men
women
and
animals
of
days
possessing
the
power
of
annihilating
space
both
of
yards
and
years
this
ghost
called
upon
a
weird
thing
who
said
after
its
surprise
at
being
disturbed
had
partly
passed
a
feathered
biped
i
am
known
to
be
but
gifted
with
the
power
of
english
speech
uttering
again
and
many
times
again
the
saddest
words
within
a
mortal
reach
a
grim
dark
thing
of
evil
omen
i
repeating
evermore
my
doleful
cry
quite
too
grewsome
even
for
me
said
the
ghost
as
he
entered
a
camp
of
brabacons
the
sentinel
surprised
at
the
strange
voice
asked
who
goes
there
and
the
ghost
not
being
able
to
reply
friend
and
too
polite
to
lie
vanished
and
soon
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
pope
of
rome
who
tradition
says
kicked
the
crown
off
a
german
head
to
show
his
power
to
make
and
unmake
kings
the
door
being
opened
the
ghost
disappeared
to
call
on
the
king
of
france
who
once
navigated
the
ohio
river
on
a
and
gave
his
name
as
smith
too
vulgar
royalty
for
me
said
the
ghost
to
himself
too
well
bred
to
show
his
contempt
turning
to
go
he
stubbed
his
toe
yes
this
ghost
had
a
real
toe
he
stubbed
his
great
toe
against
something
picking
it
up
he
found
it
to
be
the
first
book
to
have
its
pages
numbered
that
will
do
he
said
under
his
breath
to
give
to
the
hunters
it
will
be
such
a
good
joke
on
them
for
it
tells
bigger
lies
than
they
can
cutting
lots
the
ghost
next
scared
out
of
an
old
abandoned
house
a
city
of
british
india
and
was
so
startled
for
the
moment
that
he
wished
himself
in
the
united
states
with
the
insect
that
country
people
might
carry
to
the
barn
when
arriving
home
late
at
night
a
wish
being
equal
to
a
journey
by
sea
and
land
the
ghost
was
presently
in
america
on
the
way
however
he
passed
over
the
sea
which
having
two
outlets
to
larger
seas
its
waters
never
flow
out
but
always
in
and
yet
its
surface
is
ever
several
feet
lower
than
the
larger
waters
west
and
southeast
of
it
he
startled
the
midnight
judiciary
begged
the
members
pardon
retired
and
almost
immediately
crossed
seas
and
met
the
woman
who
furnished
sir
walter
scott
with
descriptions
of
irish
characters
for
one
of
his
novels
he
told
her
he
wished
to
call
next
on
the
queen
of
england
who
saved
her
husband
life
by
sucking
poison
from
a
wound
you
should
take
the
letters
with
you
as
introduction
was
the
reply
even
so
said
the
ghost
i
might
not
be
received
but
you
would
had
you
the
tact
of
the
man
who
compared
himself
when
he
should
be
dead
to
a
book
ah
yes
but
i
have
no
country
being
but
a
ghost
i
am
like
the
man
who
once
refused
a
sword
from
a
russian
czar
if
now
i
were
the
man
who
shut
up
paraguay
making
it
a
second
japan
for
years
or
the
pope
of
rome
who
was
made
a
cardinal
at
the
age
of
fourteen
ay
or
even
the
confederate
commander
at
the
siege
of
new
orleans
in
april
determining
next
to
go
to
the
smallest
and
oldest
republic
in
the
world
the
ghost
bade
his
fair
companion
adieu
and
started
wearied
with
long
travel
he
sought
conveyance
finding
himself
on
board
a
queer
one
he
asked
an
explanation
and
was
told
this
a
very
mountain
high
and
bright
in
all
the
land
i
never
seen
formed
of
a
substance
liquid
light
yet
hard
and
dealing
death
i
ween
men
view
me
with
delight
and
awe
if
i
a
distance
safe
preserve
but
my
approach
they
flee
before
nor
pause
my
beauty
to
the
ghost
next
tried
the
ship
that
carried
the
golden
fleece
this
took
him
to
lands
where
he
mounted
the
seat
beside
the
driver
of
the
chariot
of
the
sun
this
he
did
not
without
first
being
invited
he
was
too
well
bred
to
presume
but
he
had
run
his
course
for
even
the
outing
of
a
polite
ghost
must
end
the
revolutionary
general
who
was
once
tied
to
the
stake
by
indians
a
fire
started
around
him
and
was
then
saved
by
a
rainstorm
got
hold
of
him
this
polite
ghost
and
was
not
to
be
scared
by
him
who
are

the

at

of
his
lungs
and
looking
up

at

of

slides
we

two
dozen

the
mats
usually
come
with
the
opening
already
cut
but
one
style
of
mat
has
the
shape
of
different
openings
stamped
on
it
in
gilt
lines
and
may
be
cut
along
the
lines
of
the
opening
best
suited
to
the
subject
having
the
mat
ready
place
it
over
the
slide
on
the
film
side
gumming
it
slightly
at
the
corners
to
hold
it
in
place
then
in
the
lower
corner
of
the
slide
as
it
lies
film
side
up
gum
one
of
the
round
wafers
this
wafer
is
always
placed
at
the
lower
side
of
the
lantern
slide
and
is
a
guide
to
the
operator
in
putting
the
slide
into
the
lantern
dust
the
film
with
a
fine
brush
or
a
piece
of
clean
dry
chamois
and
place
over
it
one
of
the
cover
glasses
which
has
been
previously
cleaned
and
polished
these
glasses
are
very
thin
and
the
edges
sharp
and
care
must
be
taken
in
handling
or
one
is
liable
to
get
a
severe
cut
some
makers
in
preparing
a
quantity
of
slides
finish
each
slide
separately
while
others
mat
the
slides
then
apply
the
wafers
then
the
cover
glasses
and
so
on
through
the
several
operations
necessary
to
the
finishing
of
a
slide
in
the
latter
case
it
is
better
to
gum
the
cover
glasses
at
the
corners
just
enough
to
hold
them
in
place
the
next
step
is
to
bind
the
slide
and
cover
glass
together
take
one
of
the
gummed
strips
which
are
cut
the
exact
length
required
for
the
slide
moisten
it
with
a
sponge
take
the
slide
and
cover
in
the
right
hand
lay
the
end
of
the
strip
on
the
table
keeping
hold
of
it
with
the
left
hand
and
put
one
of
the
corners
of
the
slide
near
the
end
of
the
strip
press
down
firmly
on
the
strip
so
as
to
hold
it
in
place
and
bring
the
strip
along
the
edge
of
the
glass
then
without
lifting
the
slide
from
the
table
lower
the
side
on
which
has
been
placed
the
strip
and
carry
the
binder
on
to
the
next
corner
and
so
round
the
plate
turn
the
edges
of
the
strip
down
on
the
plate
cutting
away
the
extra
thickness
at
the
corners
if
the
strip
becomes
dry
before
the
operation
is
finished
it
can
be
moistened
again
the
gum
on
the
strips
is
so
very
sticky
that
it
will
bear
much
rough
usage
and
still
hold
the
slide
and
cover
glass
together
the
last
process
is
to
apply
the
labels
these
are
pasted
on
the
side
of
the
slide
opposite
the
side
on
which
is
the
wafer
the
slide
is
now
ready
for
name
and
number
which
is
written
or
printed
on
the
label
many
skilful
amateurs
make
slides
from
their
finest
plates
thinking
it
one
of
the
best
ways
of
preserving
their
pictures
for
if
the
original
negative
is
broken
another
can
be
made
from
the
slide
wilson
has
invented
an
apparatus
for
viewing
lantern
slides
without
the
aid
of
a
lantern
it
consists
of
a
large
condensing
lens
fitted
to
a
tube
in
one
end
of
which
is
a
frame
for
the
slides
this
apparatus
has
been
given
the
name
of
touroscope
harry
mclachlin
asks
for
a
treatment
for
plates
as
soon
as
the
image
flashes
up
showing
that
the
plate
has
been
take
it
from
the
developer
and
place
it
in
a
tray
of
clean
water
to
stop
development
turn
the
developer
from
the
tray
and
rinse
the
tray
mix
up
a
weak
solution
of
developer
or
dilute
this
same
developer
with
water
add
to
it
a
few
drops
of
a
solution
of
bromide
of
potassium
prepared
with
oz
of
bromide
to
oz
of
water
this
solution
should
be
mixed
ready
for
use
and
marked
restrainer
the
bromide
is
called
a
restrainer
because
it
makes
the
development
proceed
more
slowly
put
the
plate
back
in
the
tray
and
turn
over
the
weak
developer
rock
the
tray
gently
and
if
the
image
still
comes
out
too
fast
add
a
few
more
drops
of
the
bromide
unless
the
plate
has
been
very
much
one
can
get
a
good
negative
by
this
process
