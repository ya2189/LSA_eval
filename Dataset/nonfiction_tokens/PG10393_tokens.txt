making
the
house
a
home

our

page
by

happy
youth
and
smile
and
weal
and
woe
such
as
all
who
live
must
know
here
it
is
all
written
down
not
for
glory
or
renown
but
the
hope
when
we
are
gone
those
who
bravely
follow
on
meeting
care
and
pain
and
grief
will
not
falter
in
making
the
house
a
home
we
have
been
building
a
home
for
the
last
fifteen
years
but
it
begins
to
look
now
as
though
it
will
not
be
finished
for
many
years
to
come
this
is
not
because
the
contractors
are
slow
or
the
materials
scarce
or
because
we
keep
changing
our
minds
rather
it
is
because
it
takes
years
to
build
a
home
whereas
a
house
can
be
builded
in
a
few
months
mother
and
i
started
this
job
on
june
i
was
years
of
age
and
she
well
it
is
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
this
record
to
say
that
she
was
a
few
years
younger
i
was
just
closing
my
career
as
police
reporter
for
the
detroit
free
press
when
we
were
married
up
to
a
few
months
before
our
wedding
my
hours
had
been
from
three
in
the
afternoon
until
three
in
the
morning
every
day
of
the
week
except
friday
those
are
not
fit
hours
for
a
married
man
especially
a
young
married
man
so
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
my
managing
editor
thought
i
might
have
possibilities
as
a
special
writer
and
relieved
me
from
night
duty
it
was
then
we
began
to
plan
the
home
we
should
build
it
was
to
be
a
hall
of
contentment
and
the
abiding
place
of
joy
and
beauty
and
it
was
all
going
to
be
done
on
the
splendid
salary
of
dollars
a
week
that
sum
does
sound
like
much
now
but
to
us
in
january
it
was
independence
the
foundation
of
our
first
home
was
something
less
than
five
hundred
dollars
out
of
which
was
also
to
come
the
extravagance
of
a
honeymoon
trip
fortunately
for
all
of
us
life
does
not
break
its
sad
news
in
advance
dreams
are
free
and
in
their
flights
of
fancy
young
folks
may
be
as
extravagant
as
they
wish
there
may
be
breakers
ahead
and
trials
days
of
discouragement
and
despair
but
life
tells
us
nothing
of
them
to
spoil
our
dreaming
we
knew
the
sort
of
home
we
wanted
but
we
were
willing
to
begin
humbly
this
was
not
because
we
were
averse
to
starting
at
the
top
both
mother
and
i
had
then
and
have
now
a
fondness
for
the
best
things
of
life
we
should
have
liked
a
grand
piano
and
a
ice
box
and
a
servant
and
an
automobile
right
off
but
less
than
five
hundred
dollars
capital
and
dollars
a
week
salary
do
not
provide
those
things
what
we
have
would
be
a
comfortable
flat
and
some
nice
furniture
we
pay
cash
for
all
we
could
and
buy
the
remainder
of
the
necessary
things
on
time
we
had
found
a
wonderful
flat
which
we
could
rent
for
dollars
a
month
it
had
hardwood
floors
steam
heat
two
big
bedrooms
a
fine
living
room
with
a
gas
grate
a
heater
for
the
bath
and
everything
modern
and
convenient
the
landlord
would
ask
ninety
dollars
a
month
for
that
place
and
tell
you
he
was
losing
money
at
that
with
the
rent
paid
we
should
have
dollars
a
month
left
to
live
on
the
grocery
bill
at
that
time
would
not
run
more
than
twenty
dollars
a
month
telephone
gas
and
electric
light
would
not
exceed
ten
dollars
a
month
the
milkman
and
the
paper
boy
would
take
but
little
and
in
winter
time
a
ton
of
coal
per
month
would
be
sufficient
oh
we
should
have
plenty
of
money
and
could
easily
afford
to
pledge
twenty
dollars
a
month
to
pay
for
necessary
furniture
it
will
be
noticed
that
into
our
dreaming
came
no
physician
no
dentist
no
expenses
bobbing
up
from
unexpected
sources
not
a
single
bill
collector
called
at
the
front
door
of
our
dream
castle
to
ask
for
money
which
we
did
not
have
if
older
and
wiser
heads
suggested
the
possibility
of
danger
we
produced
our
plans
on
paper
and
asked
them
from
whence
could
trouble
come
we
understand
the
depth
of
the
kindly
smile
which
our
protests
always
evoked
they
were
letting
the
dreamers
dream
at
last
the
furniture
was
bought
on
the
installment
plan
and
the
new
flat
was
being
put
in
order
it
called
for
a
few
more
pieces
of
furniture
than
we
had
figured
on
and
the
debt
in
consequence
was
greater
but
that
meant
merely
a
few
months
more
to
make
payments
it
was
fine
furniture
too
of
course
it
has
long
since
ceased
to
serve
us
but
never
in
this
world
shall
that
dining
set
be
duplicated
for
perfection
of
finish
and
loveliness
of
design
that
first
oak
dining
table
will
linger
in
our
memories
for
life
the
one
we
now
have
cost
more
than
all
the
money
we
spent
for
all
the
furniture
with
which
we
began
housekeeping
and
yet
figuring
according
to
the
joy
it
has
brought
to
us
it
is
poor
in
comparison
and
so
it
was
too
with
the
mahogany
settee
upholstered
in
green
plush
and
the
beveled
glass
dresser
and
the
chairs
we
used
to
make
evening
trips
over
to
that
flat
merely
for
the
joy
of
admiring
these
things
our
things
the
first
we
had
ever
possessed
then
came
the
night
of
june
we
had
both
looked
forward
to
that
wonderful
honeymoon
trip
up
the
lakes
to
mackinac
island
and
tomorrow
we
were
to
start
but
right
then
i
am
sure
that
both
mother
and
i
wished
we
might
call
it
off
it
seemed
so
foolish
to
go
away
from
such
a
beautiful
flat
and
such
lovely
furniture
the
honeymoon
trip
lasted
two
weeks
and
one
day
at
mackinac
island
i
found
mother
in
tears
what
the
matter
i
asked
i
want
to
go
home
she
said
i
know
i
am
silly
and
foolish
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
our
own
house
and
our
own
furniture
and
arrange
our
wedding
presents
and
hang
the
curtains
and
put
that
set
of
haviland
china
in
the
cabinet
so
back
we
came
to
begin
our
in
earnest
the
rent
and
the
furniture
installments
came
due
regularly
just
as
we
had
expected
so
did
the
gas
and
electric
light
and
telephone
bills
but
somehow
or
other
our
dream
figures
and
the
actual
realities
did
not
balance
there
never
was
a
month
when
there
was
as
much
left
of
our
dollars
as
we
had
figured
there
should
have
been
for
one
thing
i
was
taken
that
brought
the
doctor
into
the
house
and
since
then
we
have
always
had
him
to
reckon
with
and
to
settle
with
then
there
was
an
insurance
policy
to
keep
up
in
our
dream
days
the
possibility
of
my
dying
sometime
had
never
entered
our
heads
but
now
it
was
an
awful
reality
and
that
quarterly
premium
developed
a
distressing
habit
of
falling
due
at
the
most
inopportune
times
just
when
we
thought
we
should
have
at
least
twenty
dollars
for
ourselves
in
would
come
the
little
yellow
slip
informing
us
that
the
thirty
grace
expired
on
the
fifth
but
the
was
still
in
our
dreams
we
were
happy
but
we
were
going
to
be
still
happier
if
ever
we
could
get
rid
of
those
furniture
installments
we
could
start
saving
for
the
kind
of
home
we
wanted
then
one
evening
mother
whispered
the
happiest
message
a
wife
ever
tells
a
husband
we
were
no
longer
to
live
merely
for
ourselves
there
was
to
be
another
soon
who
should
bind
us
closer
together
and
fill
our
lives
with
gladness
but
and
many
a
night
we
sat
for
hours
and
planned
and
talked
and
wondered
were
we
to
meet
the
expense
there
was
nothing
in
the
savings
bank
and
much
was
needed
there
mother
had
cherished
for
years
her
ideas
for
her
baby
outfit
they
would
cost
money
and
i
would
be
no
miserly
father
either
my
child
should
have
the
best
of
everything
somehow
it
was
up
to
me
to
get
it
somehow
to
if
only
that
furniture
were
paid
for
then
a
curious
event
occurred
i
owed
little
bills
amounting
to
about
dollars
this
sum
included
the
gas
electric
light
and
telephone
bills
on
which
an
added
sum
was
charged
if
unpaid
before
the
tenth
of
the
month
i
had
no
money
to
meet
them
i
was
worried
and
discouraged
to
borrow
that
sum
would
have
been
easy
but
to
pay
it
back
would
have
been
difficult
that
very
morning
into
the
office
came
the
press
agent
of
a
local
theatre
accompanied
by
henry
dixey
the
actor
dixey
wanted
two
lyrics
for
songs
he
had
the
ideas
which
he
wished
expressed
in
rhyme
and
wondered
whether
or
not
i
would
attempt
them
i
promised
him
that
i
would
and
on
the
spot
he
handed
me
dollars
in
cash
to
bind
the
bargain
if
those
songs
proved
successful
i
should
have
more
the
way
out
had
been
provided
from
dixey
point
of
view
those
songs
were
not
a
success
but
from
mine
they
were
for
they
bridged
me
over
a
chasm
i
had
thought
i
could
not
leap
i
never
heard
from
that
pair
of
songs
afterward
but
neither
mother
nor
i
will
ever
forget
the
day
they
were
written
it
meant
more
than
the
mere
paying
of
bills
too
it
taught
us
to
have
faith
faith
in
ourselves
and
faith
in
the
future
there
is
always
a
way
out
of
the
difficulties
even
though
we
can
not
see
or
guess
what
that
way
is
to
be
it
will
be
provided
since
then
we
have
gone
together
through
many
dark
days
and
cruel
hurts
and
bitter
disappointments
but
always
to
come
out
stronger
for
the
test
the
next
few
months
were
devoted
to
preparations
for
the
baby
and
our
financial
reckonings
had
to
be
readjusted
i
had
to
find
ways
of
making
a
little
more
money
i
was
not
after
much
money
but
i
must
have
more
all
i
had
to
sell
was
what
i
could
write
where
was
a
quick
market
for
a
poor
newspaper
man
wares
my
experience
with
dixey
turned
me
to
the
vaudeville
stage
i
could
write
playlets
i
thought
so
while
mother
was
busy
sewing
at
nights
i
devoted
myself
to
writing
and
at
last
the
first
sketch
was
finished
at
the
temple
theatre
that
week
was
the
popular
character
actor
william
thompson
to
him
i
showed
the
manuscript
of
the
sketch
which
was
called
the
matchmaker
thompson
took
it
on
tuesday
and
on
friday
he
sent
word
that
he
wished
to
see
me
into
his
i
went
almost
afraid
to
face
him
it
a
bully
little
sketch
said
he
as
i
sat
on
his
trunk
and
like
to
buy
it
from
you
i
ca
pay
as
much
as
i
should
like
but
if
you
care
to
let
me
have
it
i
give
you
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
now
and
the
remaining
hundred
next
week
i
tried
to
appear
indifferent
but
the
heart
of
me
was
almost
bursting
with
excitement
it
meant
that
the
furniture
bill
was
as
good
as
paid
and
there
would
be
money
in
the
bank
for
the
first
time
since
we
were
married
the
deal
was
made
and
i
left
the
theatre
with
the
largest
sum
of
money
i
had
ever
made
all
at
once
later
someone
said
to
me
that
i
was
foolish
to
sell
that
sketch
outright
for
so
little
money
foolish
said
i
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
looked
bigger
to
me
than
the
promise
of
a
thousand
some
day
in
the
future
once
more
the
way
out
had
been
provided
and
then
came
the
baby
a
glorious
little
girl
and
the
home
had
begun
to
be
there
was
a
new
charm
to
the
walls
and
halls
the
oak
table
and
the
green
plush
settee
took
on
a
new
glory
i
was
the
usual
proud
father
with
added
variations
of
my
own
one
of
my
pet
illusions
was
that
none
save
mother
and
me
was
to
be
trusted
to
hold
our
little
one
when
others
take
her
i
stood
guard
to
catch
her
if
in
some
careless
moment
they
should
let
her
fall
as
she
grew
older
my
collars
became
where
her
little
hands
had
touched
them
we
had
pictures
on
our
walls
of
course
and
trinkets
on
the
mantelpiece
and
a
large
glass
mirror
which
had
been
one
of
our
wedding
gifts
these
things
had
become
commonplace
to
us
until
the
baby
began
to
notice
them
night
after
night
i
would
take
her
in
my
arms
and
show
her
the
sheep
in
one
of
the
pictures
and
talk
to
her
about
them
and
she
would
coo
delightedly
the
trinkets
on
the
mantelpiece
became
dearer
to
us
because
she
loved
to
handle
them
the
home
was
being
sanctified
by
her
presence
we
had
come
into
a
new
realm
of
happiness
but
a
home
can
not
be
builded
always
on
happiness
we
were
to
learn
that
through
bitter
experience
we
had
seen
white
crepe
on
other
doors
without
ever
thinking
that
some
day
it
might
flutter
on
our
own
we
had
witnessed
sorrow
but
had
never
suffered
it
our
home
had
welcomed
many
a
gay
and
smiling
visitor
but
there
was
a
grim
and
sinister
one
to
come
against
whom
no
door
can
be
barred
after
thirteen
months
of
perfect
happiness
its
planning
and
dreaming
the
baby
was
taken
from
us
the
blow
fell
without
warning
i
left
home
that
morning
with
mother
and
the
baby
waving
their
usual
farewells
to
me
from
the
window
early
that
afternoon
contrary
to
my
usual
custom
i
decided
to
go
home
in
advance
of
my
regular
time
i
had
no
reason
for
doing
this
aside
from
a
strange
unwillingness
to
continue
at
work
i
recalled
later
that
i
cleaned
up
my
desk
and
put
away
a
number
of
things
as
though
i
were
going
away
for
some
time
i
never
before
had
done
that
and
nothing
had
occurred
which
might
make
me
think
i
should
not
be
back
at
my
desk
as
usual
when
i
reached
home
the
baby
was
suffering
from
a
slight
fever
and
mother
already
had
called
the
doctor
in
he
diagnosed
it
as
only
a
slight
disturbance
during
dinner
i
thought
baby
breathing
was
not
as
regular
as
it
should
be
and
i
summoned
the
doctor
immediately
her
condition
grew
rapidly
worse
and
a
second
physician
was
called
but
it
was
not
in
human
skill
to
save
her
at
eleven
that
night
she
was
taken
from
us
it
is
needless
to
dwell
here
upon
the
agony
of
that
first
dark
time
through
which
we
passed
that
such
a
blow
could
leave
loveliness
in
its
path
and
add
a
touch
of
beauty
to
our
dwelling
place
seemed
unbelievable
at
the
time
yet
our
first
baby
still
lives
with
us
as
wonderful
as
she
was
in
those
glad
thirteen
months
she
has
not
grown
older
as
have
we
but
smiles
that
same
sweet
baby
smile
of
hers
upon
us
as
of
old
we
can
talk
of
her
now
bravely
and
proudly
and
we
have
come
to
understand
that
it
was
a
privilege
to
have
had
her
even
for
those
brief
thirteen
months
to
have
joys
in
common
is
the
dream
of
man
and
wife
we
had
supposed
that
love
was
based
on
mutual
and
mother
and
i
had
been
happy
together
we
had
been
walking
arm
in
arm
under
blue
skies
and
we
knew
how
much
we
meant
to
each
other
but
just
how
much
we
each
other
neither
of
us
really
knew
until
we
had
to
share
a
common
sorrow
to
be
partners
in
a
sacred
memory
is
a
divine
bond
to
be
partners
in
a
little
mound
in
one
of
god
silent
gardens
is
the
closest
relationship
which
man
and
woman
can
know
on
this
earth
our
lives
had
been
happy
before
now
they
had
been
made
beautiful
so
it
was
with
the
home
it
began
to
mean
more
to
us
as
we
began
each
to
mean
more
to
the
other
the
bedroom
in
which
our
baby
fell
asleep
seemed
glorified
of
course
there
were
the
lonely
days
and
weeks
and
months
when
everything
we
touched
or
saw
brought
back
the
memory
of
her
i
came
home
many
an
evening
to
find
on
mother
face
the
mark
of
tears
and
i
knew
she
had
been
living
over
by
herself
the
sorrow
of
it
all
i
learned
how
much
braver
the
woman
has
to
be
than
the
man
i
could
go
into
town
where
there
was
the
contagion
of
good
cheer
and
where
my
work
absorbed
my
thoughts
and
helped
to
shut
out
grief
but
not
so
with
mother
she
must
live
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
amid
the
scenes
of
her
anguish
no
matter
where
she
turned
something
reminded
her
of
the
joy
we
had
known
and
lost
even
the
striking
clock
called
back
to
her
mind
the
hour
when
something
should
have
been
done
for
the
baby
i
have
another
little
girl
she
sobbed
night
after
night
i
have
another
little
girl
and
once
more
the
way
out
was
provided
we
heard
of
a
little
girl
who
was
to
be
put
out
for
adoption
she
was
of
good
but
unfortunate
parents
we
proposed
to
adopt
her
i
have
heard
many
arguments
against
adopting
children
but
i
have
never
heard
a
good
one
even
the
infant
doomed
to
die
could
enrich
if
only
for
a
few
weeks
the
lives
of
a
childless
couple
and
they
would
be
happier
for
the
rest
of
their
days
in
the
knowledge
that
they
had
tried
to
do
something
worthy
in
this
world
and
had
made
comfortable
the
brief
life
of
a
little
one
what
if
the
child
should
turn
out
wrong
i
hear
often
from
the
lips
of
men
and
women
what
of
that
i
reply
you
can
at
least
be
happy
in
the
thought
that
you
have
tried
to
do
something
for
another
to
childless
couples
everywhere
i
would
say
with
all
the
force
i
can
employ
a
if
you
would
make
glorious
the
home
you
are
building
if
you
would
fill
its
rooms
with
laughter
and
contentment
if
you
would
make
your
house
more
than
a
place
in
which
to
eat
and
sleep
if
you
would
fill
it
with
happy
memories
and
come
yourselves
into
a
closer
and
more
perfect
union
adopt
a
baby
then
in
a
year
or
two
adopt
another
he
who
spends
money
on
a
little
child
is
investing
it
to
real
purpose
and
the
dividends
it
pays
in
pride
and
happiness
and
contentment
are
beyond
computation
marjorie
came
to
us
when
she
was
three
years
old
she
bubbled
over
with
mirth
and
laughter
and
soothed
the
ache
in
our
hearts
she
filled
the
little
niches
and
comers
of
our
lives
with
her
sweetness
and
became
not
only
ours
in
name
but
ours
also
in
love
and
its
actualities
there
were
those
who
suggested
that
we
were
too
young
to
adopt
a
child
they
told
us
that
the
other
children
would
undoubtedly
be
sent
to
us
as
time
went
on
i
have
neither
the
space
here
nor
the
inclination
to
list
the
imaginary
difficulties
outlined
to
us
as
the
possibilities
of
adoption
but
mother
and
i
talked
it
all
over
one
evening
and
we
decided
that
we
needed
marjorie
and
marjorie
needed
us
as
to
the
financial
side
of
the
question
i
smiled
i
never
heard
of
anyone
going
to
the
poorhouse
or
into
bankruptcy
i
said
because
of
the
money
spent
on
a
child
i
fancy
i
can
pay
the
bills
that
settled
it
the
next
evening
when
i
came
home
down
the
stairway
leading
to
our
flat
came
the
cry
hello
daddy
from
one
of
the
sweetest
little
faces
i
have
ever
seen
and
from
that
day
until
god
needed
her
more
and
called
her
home
that
hello
daddy
greeted
me
and
made
every
care
worth
while
the
little
home
had
begun
to
grow
in
beauty
once
more
that
first
shopping
tour
for
marjorie
stands
out
as
an
epoch
in
our
lives
i
am
not
of
the
right
sex
to
describe
it
marjorie
came
to
us
with
only
such
clothing
as
a
poor
mother
could
provide
she
must
be
outfitted
anew
from
head
to
toe
and
she
was
the
next
evening
when
she
greeted
me
she
was
the
proud
possessor
of
more
lovely
things
than
she
had
ever
known
before
but
beautiful
as
the
little
face
appeared
to
me
then
more
beautiful
was
the
look
in
mother
face
there
had
come
into
her
eyes
a
look
of
happiness
which
had
been
absent
for
many
months
i
learned
then
and
i
state
it
now
as
a
positive
fact
that
a
woman
greatest
happiness
comes
from
dressing
a
little
girl
mothers
may
like
pretty
clothes
for
themselves
but
to
put
pretty
things
on
a
little
girl
is
an
infinitely
greater
pleasure
more
than
once
mother
went
for
something
for
herself
only
to
return
without
it
but
with
something
for
marjorie
we
pledged
to
ourselves
at
the
very
beginning
that
we
would
make
marjorie
ours
not
only
to
ourselves
but
to
others
our
friends
were
asked
never
to
refer
in
her
presence
to
the
fact
that
she
was
adopted
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
it
was
dismissed
from
our
minds
she
was
three
years
old
when
she
was
born
to
us
and
from
then
on
we
were
her
father
and
her
mother
to
many
who
knew
her
and
loved
her
this
article
will
be
the
first
intimation
they
ever
have
received
that
marjorie
was
not
our
own
flesh
and
blood
it
was
her
pride
and
boast
that
she
was
like
her
mother
but
had
her
father
eyes
both
her
mother
and
i
have
smiled
hundreds
of
times
as
people
meeting
her
for
the
first
time
would
say
anyone
would
know
she
belonged
to
you
she
looks
exactly
like
you
marjorie
made
a
difference
in
our
way
of
living
a
flat
comfortable
though
it
was
was
not
a
good
place
to
bring
up
a
little
girl
more
than
ever
we
needed
a
home
of
our
own
but
to
need
and
to
provide
are
two
different
propositions
we
needed
a
back
yard
but
back
yards
are
expensive
and
though
newspapermen
may
make
good
husbands
they
seldom
make
good
money
one
evening
mother
announced
to
me
that
she
had
seen
the
house
we
ought
to
have
it
had
just
been
completed
had
everything
in
it
her
heart
had
wished
for
and
could
be
bought
for
hundred
dollars
the
price
was
just
hundred
dollars
more
than
i
had
all
i
did
have
was
the
wish
to
own
a
home
of
my
own
but
four
years
of
our
married
life
had
gone
and
i
was
no
nearer
the
first
payment
on
a
house
than
when
we
began
as
man
and
wife
however
i
investigated
and
found
that
i
could
get
this
particular
house
by
paying
five
hundred
dollars
down
and
agreeing
to
pay
a
month
on
the
balance
i
could
swing
a
month
but
the
five
hundred
was
a
high
barrier
then
i
made
my
first
wise
business
move
i
went
to
julius
haass
president
of
the
wayne
county
and
home
savings
bank
who
always
had
been
my
friend
and
explained
to
him
my
difficulties
he
loaned
me
that
five
hundred
dollars
for
the
first
payment
i
to
pay
it
back
dollars
monthly
and
the
house
was
ours
we
had
become
land
owners
overnight
my
income
had
increased
of
course
but
so
had
my
liabilities
the
first
few
years
of
that
new
house
taxed
our
ingenuity
more
than
once
we
spent
now
and
then
not
money
which
we
had
but
money
which
we
were
to
but
it
was
buying
happiness
if
ever
a
couple
have
found
real
happiness
in
this
world
we
found
it
under
the
roof
of
that
leicester
court
home
there
nearly
all
that
has
brought
joy
and
peace
and
contentment
into
our
lives
was
born
to
us
it
was
from
there
i
began
to
progress
it
was
there
my
publishers
found
me
and
it
was
there
little
bud
was
born
to
us
we
are
out
of
it
now
we
left
it
for
a
big
reason
but
we
drive
by
it
often
just
to
see
it
for
it
is
still
ours
in
the
precious
memory
of
the
years
we
spent
within
its
walls
still
in
the
beginning
it
was
just
a
house
it
had
no
associations
and
no
history
it
had
been
built
to
sell
the
people
who
paid
for
its
construction
saw
in
its
growing
walls
and
rooftree
only
the
few
hundred
dollars
they
hoped
to
gain
it
was
left
to
us
to
change
that
into
a
it
sounds
preachy
i
know
to
say
that
all
buildings
depend
for
their
real
beauty
upon
the
spirit
of
the
people
who
inhabit
them
but
it
is
true
as
the
weeks
and
months
slipped
by
the
new
house
began
to
soften
and
mellow
under
mother
gentle
touches
the
assumed
an
air
of
comfort
my
books
now
had
a
real
corner
of
their
own
the
or
rather
the
little
already
had
entertained
its
transient
tenants
and
as
our
friends
came
and
went
the
walls
caught
something
from
them
all
to
remind
us
of
their
presence
i
took
to
gardening
the
grounds
were
small
but
they
were
large
enough
to
teach
me
the
joy
of
an
intimate
friendship
with
growing
things
in
my
somewhat
larger
garden
i
have
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
rosebushes
and
twenty
or
thirty
peony
clumps
and
i
know
their
names
and
their
habits
the
garden
has
become
a
part
of
the
home
it
is
not
yet
the
garden
i
dream
of
nor
even
the
garden
which
i
think
it
will
be
next
year
but
it
is
the
place
where
play
divides
the
ground
with
beauty
what
bud
does
require
for
a
baseball
diamond
the
roses
possess
early
one
morning
in
july
bud
came
to
us
immediately
the
character
of
that
front
bedroom
was
changed
it
was
no
longer
just
our
bedroom
it
was
the
room
where
bud
was
born
of
all
the
rooms
in
all
the
houses
of
all
the
world
there
is
none
so
gloriously
treasured
in
the
memories
of
man
and
woman
as
those
wherein
their
children
have
come
to
birth
i
have
had
many
fine
things
happen
to
me
friends
have
borne
me
high
on
kindly
shoulders
out
of
the
depths
of
their
generous
hearts
they
have
given
me
honors
which
i
have
not
deserved
i
have
more
than
once
come
home
proud
in
the
possession
of
some
new
joy
or
of
some
task
accomplished
but
i
have
never
known
and
never
shall
know
a
thrill
of
happiness
to
equal
that
which
followed
good
old
doctor
gordon
brief
announcement
it
a
boy
it
a
boy
all
that
day
and
the
next
i
fairly
shouted
it
to
friends
and
strangers
to
marjorie
sweetness
and
to
the
radiant
loveliness
of
the
little
baby
which
was
ours
for
so
brief
a
time
had
been
added
the
strength
and
roguishness
of
a
boy
the
next
five
years
saw
the
walls
of
our
home
change
in
character
finger
marks
and
hammer
marks
began
to
appear
when
bud
had
reached
the
stage
where
he
could
walk
calamity
began
to
follow
in
his
trail
once
he
tugged
at
a
table
cover
and
the
open
bottle
of
ink
fell
upon
the
rug
there
was
a
great
splotch
of
ink
forever
to
be
visible
to
all
who
entered
that
yet
even
that
black
stain
became
in
time
a
part
of
us
we
grew
even
to
boast
of
it
we
pointed
it
out
to
new
acquaintances
as
the
place
where
bud
spilled
the
ink
it
was
an
evidence
of
his
health
and
his
natural
tendencies
it
proved
to
all
the
world
that
in
bud
we
had
a
real
boy
an
boy
who
could
spill
ink
and
if
you
did
keep
a
close
watch
on
him
then
came
the
toy
period
of
our
development
the
once
tidy
house
became
a
place
where
angels
would
have
feared
to
tread
in
the
dark
building
blocks
and
trains
of
cars
and
fire
engines
and
a
rocking
horse
were
everywhere
to
trip
the
feet
of
the
unwary
mother
scolded
about
it
at
times
and
i
fear
i
myself
have
muttered
harsh
things
when
late
at
night
i
have
entered
the
house
only
to
stumble
against
the
tin
sides
of
an
express
wagon
but
i
have
come
to
see
that
toys
in
a
house
are
its
real
adornments
there
is
no
pleasanter
sight
within
the
front
door
of
any
man
castle
than
the
strewn
and
disordered
evidences
that
children
there
abide
the
house
seems
unfurnished
without
them
this
chaos
still
exists
in
our
house
mother
says
i
encourage
it
perhaps
i
do
i
know
that
i
dread
the
coming
day
when
the
home
shall
become
neat
and
orderly
and
silent
and
precise
what
is
more
i
live
in
horror
of
the
day
when
i
shall
have
to
sit
down
to
a
meal
and
not
send
a
certain
little
fellow
away
from
the
table
to
wash
his
hands
that
has
become
a
part
of
the
ceremonial
of
my
life
when
the
evening
comes
that
he
will
appear
for
dinner
clean
and
immaculate
his
shirt
buttoned
properly
and
his
hair
nicely
brushed
perhaps
mother
will
be
proud
of
him
but
as
for
me
there
will
be
a
lump
in
my
throat
for
i
shall
know
that
he
has
grown
up
financially
we
were
progressing
we
had
a
little
more
to
do
with
as
mother
expressed
it
but
sorrow
and
grief
and
anxiety
were
not
through
with
us
we
were
not
to
be
one
hundred
per
cent
happy
no
one
ever
is
marjorie
was
stricken
with
typhoid
fever
and
for
fourteen
weeks
we
fought
that
battle
saw
her
sink
almost
into
the
very
arms
of
death
and
watched
her
pale
and
wasted
body
day
by
day
until
at
last
the
fever
broke
and
she
was
spared
to
us
another
bedroom
assumed
a
new
meaning
to
us
both
we
knew
it
as
it
was
in
the
dark
hours
of
night
we
saw
the
morning
sun
break
through
its
windows
it
was
the
first
room
i
visited
in
the
morning
and
the
last
i
went
to
every
night
coming
home
i
never
stopped
in
hall
or
but
hurried
straight
to
her
all
there
was
in
that
home
then
was
marjorie
room
we
lived
our
lives
within
it
and
gradually
her
strength
returned
and
we
were
happy
again
but
only
for
a
brief
time
early
the
following
summer
i
was
called
home
by
doctor
johnson
when
i
reached
there
he
met
me
at
the
front
door
smiling
as
though
to
reassure
me
you
and
bud
are
going
to
get
out
said
he
marjorie
has
scarlet
fever
bud
had
already
been
sent
to
his
aunt
florence
i
was
to
gather
what
clothing
i
should
need
for
six
weeks
and
depart
if
i
had
been
fond
of
that
home
before
i
grew
fonder
of
it
as
the
days
went
by
i
think
i
never
knew
how
much
i
valued
it
until
i
was
shut
out
from
it
i
could
see
mother
and
marjorie
through
the
window
but
i
was
not
to
enter
and
i
grew
hungry
for
a
sight
of
the
walls
with
their
finger
marks
and
of
the
ink
spot
on
the
rug
we
had
been
six
years
in
the
building
of
that
home
somehow
a
part
of
us
had
been
woven
into
every
nook
and
corner
of
it
but
marjorie
was
not
thriving
her
cheeks
were
pale
and
slightly
flushed
the
removal
of
tonsils
did
help
followed
a
visit
to
my
dentist
perhaps
a
tooth
was
spreading
poison
through
her
system
he
looked
at
her
and
after
a
few
minutes
took
me
alone
into
his
private
office
i
sorry
eddie
he
said
i
am
afraid
it
is
teeth
you
have
a
long
hard
fight
to
make
if
it
is
what
i
think
it
is
tuberculosis
had
entered
our
home
it
had
come
by
way
of
typhoid
and
scarlet
fevers
the
specialist
confirmed
doctor
oakman
suspicions
and
our
battle
began
the
little
home
could
serve
us
no
longer
it
was
not
the
place
for
such
a
fight
for
life
as
we
were
to
make
marjorie
must
have
a
sleeping
porch
and
the
house
lacked
that
nor
could
one
be
built
upon
it
and
so
we
found
our
present
home
it
was
for
sale
at
a
price
i
thought
then
i
should
never
be
able
to
pay
we
could
have
it
by
making
a
down
payment
of
hundred
dollars
the
balance
to
be
covered
by
a
mortgage
but
i
neither
had
that
much
nor
owned
securities
for
even
a
small
fraction
of
it
but
i
did
have
a
friend
a
rich
but
generous
friend
i
told
him
what
i
wanted
and
he
seemed
more
grieved
at
my
burden
than
concerned
with
my
request
he
talked
only
of
marjorie
and
her
chances
he
put
his
arm
about
my
shoulders
and
i
knew
he
was
with
me
what
do
you
need
he
asked
hundred
dollars
in
cash
he
smiled
have
a
lawyer
examine
the
abstract
to
the
property
and
if
it
is
all
right
come
back
to
me
in
two
days
i
was
back
the
title
to
the
house
was
clear
he
smiled
again
and
handed
me
his
check
for
the
amount
with
not
a
scratch
of
the
paper
between
us
i
suggested
something
of
that
sort
to
him
the
important
thing
is
to
get
the
house
he
said
when
that
is
done
and
you
have
the
deed
to
it
and
the
papers
all
fixed
up
you
come
back
and
we
fix
up
our
little
matter
and
that
is
how
it
was
done
so
into
our
present
home
we
moved
we
had
a
bigger
and
a
better
and
a
costlier
dwelling
place
we
were
climbing
upward
but
we
were
also
beginning
once
more
with
just
a
house
just
a
house
but
founded
on
a
mighty
purpose
it
was
to
become
home
to
us
even
more
dearly
loved
than
the
one
we
were
leaving
for
four
years
it
has
grown
in
our
affections
hope
has
been
ours
we
have
lived
and
laughed
and
sung
and
progressed
but
we
have
also
wept
and
grieved
twice
the
doctor
had
said
we
were
to
conquer
then
came
last
spring
and
the
end
of
hope
week
after
week
marjorie
saw
the
sunbeams
filter
through
the
windows
of
her
open
porch
near
by
a
pair
of
robins
built
their
nest
she
watched
them
and
knew
them
and
named
them
we
planned
great
things
together
and
great
journeys
we
should
make
that
they
were
not
to
be
she
never
knew
and
then
she
fell
asleep
her
little
life
had
fulfilled
its
mission
she
had
brought
joy
and
beauty
and
faith
into
our
hearts
she
had
comforted
us
in
our
hours
of
loneliness
and
despair
she
had
been
the
little
cheerful
builder
of
our
home
and
perhaps
god
needed
her
she
continued
to
sleep
for
three
days
only
for
those
three
days
her
sun
porch
was
a
bower
of
roses
on
memorial
day
mother
and
i
stood
once
more
together
beside
a
little
mound
where
god
had
led
us
late
that
afternoon
we
returned
to
the
home
to
which
marjorie
had
taken
us
it
had
grown
more
lovely
with
the
beauty
which
has
been
ours
because
of
her
the
home
is
not
yet
completed
we
still
cherish
our
dreams
of
what
it
is
to
be
we
would
change
this
and
that
but
after
all
what
the
home
is
to
be
is
not
within
our
power
to
say
we
hope
to
go
forward
together
building
and
changing
and
improving
it
shall
see
something
that
was
not
there
yesterday
but
through
sun
and
shade
through
trial
and
through
days
of
ease
and
of
peace
it
is
our
hope
that
something
of
our
best
shall
still
remain
whatever
happens
it
is
our
hope
that
what
may
be
just
a
house
to
many
shall
be
to
us
the
home
we
have
been
building
for
the
last
fifteen
years
home
by
edgar
a
guest
it
takes
a
heap
o
