here
is
the
law
of
life
as
laid
down
by
the
prophet
isaiah
in
that
remarkable
chapter
commencing
ho
every
one
that
thirsteth
whether
it
be
after
knowledge
or
any
other
earthly
or
spiritual
good
come
unto
me
and
i
will
give
you
that
which
you
seek
this
is
the
spirit
of
the
text
and
these
are
the
words
at
the
commencement
of
the
tenth
verse
as
the
rain
cometh
down
and
the
snow
from
heaven
and
returneth
not
thither
but
watereth
the
earth
and
maketh
it
bring
forth
and
bud
first
bud
bear
seed
and
then
bring
that
it
may
give
seed
to
the
sower
and
bread
to
the
eater
being
the
only
sower
of
seed
and
eater
of
so
shall
my
word
be
word
of
that
goeth
forth
out
of
my
mouth
mouth
of
the
it
shall
not
return
unto
me
void
but
it
shall
accomplish
that
which
i
lord
please
and
it
living
shall
prosper
in
the
thing
whereto
i
sent
it
this
formula
of
life
is
as
true
now
as
it
was
over
two
thousand
six
hundred
years
ago
when
it
was
penned
by
the
divinely
inspired
prophet
and
it
is
as
true
now
as
it
was
then
that
instead
of
the
thorn
shall
come
up
the
fir
tree
and
instead
of
the
briar
shall
come
up
the
myrtle
tree
and
it
shall
be
to
the
lord
for
a
name
for
an
everlasting
sign
that
shall
not
be
cut
off
that
is
as
the
rains
descend
and
the
floods
come
and
change
the
face
of
the
earth
a
law
equivalent
to
the
divine
command
let
the
earth
bring
forth
is
forever
operative
changing
the
face
of
nature
and
causing
it
to
give
expression
to
new
forms
of
life
as
the
conditions
thereof
are
changed
and
these
forms
are
spoken
into
existence
by
the
divine
fiat
in
all
the
alternations
of
forest
growths
that
are
taking
place
on
this
continent
or
elsewhere
this
one
vital
law
is
traceable
everywhere
in
the
course
of
the
next
year
it
will
be
as
palpable
in
the
island
of
java
recently
desolated
by
the
most
disastrous
earthquake
recorded
in
history
as
in
any
other
portion
of
the
earth
however
free
from
such
volcanic
action
on
the
very
spot
where
mountain
ranges
disappeared
in
a
flaming
sea
of
fire
and
other
ranges
were
thrown
up
in
parallel
lines
but
on
different
bases
and
where
it
was
evident
that
every
seed
plant
tree
and
thing
of
life
perished
in
one
common
vortex
of
ruin
animal
as
well
as
vegetable
life
will
make
its
appearance
in
obedience
to
this
law
as
soon
as
the
rains
shall
again
descend
cool
the
basaltic
and
other
rocks
and
the
power
referred
to
by
isaiah
once
more
become
operative
there
is
no
more
doubt
of
this
in
the
mind
of
the
learned
naturalist
than
in
that
of
the
most
devout
believer
of
the
bible
from
which
this
most
remarkable
formula
is
taken
we
have
no
disposition
to
arraign
the
american
and
european
agnostics
as
they
are
pleased
to
call
themselves
for
using
the
term
nature
instead
of
god
in
their
philosophical
writings
as
long
as
they
are
evidently
earnest
seekers
after
as
it
is
to
be
found
in
nature
the
work
of
god
they
are
most
welcome
into
the
temple
of
science
and
their
theories
deserve
our
thoughtful
consideration
it
is
only
when
they
become
dogmatic
and
assert
propositions
that
have
no
foundation
in
truth
as
we
sincerely
believe
that
we
propose
to
break
a
lance
at
their
expense
and
lay
bare
their
fallacies
we
claim
nothing
more
for
ourself
as
a
scientific
writer
than
we
are
willing
and
ready
to
accord
to
them
indeed
we
would
champion
their
right
to
be
heard
sooner
than
we
would
our
own
on
the
principle
that
it
is
our
duty
to
be
just
to
others
before
we
are
generous
to
ourselves
or
those
of
our
own
following
but
our
agnostic
friends
should
remember
that
when
they
charge
us
with
being
dogmatic
in
science
the
charge
should
be
made
good
from
a
scientific
and
not
merely
by
the
bandying
of
words
when
they
tell
us
for
instance
that
a
toad
has
hibernated
for
a
million
years
in
any
one
of
the
stratified
rocks
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
we
interpose
the
objection
that
none
of
these
batrachian
forms
can
exist
for
a
period
of
more
than
twelve
months
without
air
and
food
and
yet
they
have
been
blasted
out
of
cavities
in
the
surface
rocks
of
the
earth
where
they
have
apparently
lain
for
the
period
named
by
our
scientific
friends
referred
to
the
fault
is
not
ours
but
theirs
that
they
are
in
error
had
they
determined
to
study
the
subject
of
life
as
we
have
done
from
the
bible
as
well
as
from
nature
they
would
have
commenced
at
these
rocks
and
worked
their
way
upward
to
the
source
of
all
life
and
not
downward
to
the
vanishing
point
that
where
animal
life
ceases
in
the
azoic
rocks
the
batrachians
are
low
down
in
the
scale
of
nature
but
they
have
a
determinate
period
of
existence
as
do
all
other
forms
of
life
try
your
experiments
with
them
see
how
long
they
will
live
without
light
air
and
food
this
you
can
do
as
well
as
ourself
conform
to
all
the
conditions
required
the
absolute
exclusion
of
light
air
and
food
and
you
will
find
that
the
toughest
specimen
experimented
with
is
a
dead
batrachian
inside
of
one
year
this
experimental
test
should
settle
the
question
of
lengthened
vitality
between
us
there
is
no
miracle
about
this
matter
at
all
and
science
finds
no
in
the
way
of
a
complete
explication
of
this
riddle
if
in
the
light
of
nature
there
be
any
such
riddle
we
claim
there
is
not
when
we
interpret
nature
in
the
light
of
nature
god
let
the
earth
or
rather
its
silicious
and
other
decaying
rocks
bring
forth
these
batrachian
forms
the
command
is
imperative
and
not
dependent
upon
any
seed
previously
scattered
or
sown
in
the
earth
itself
the
father
of
the
writer
was
superintendent
of
the
green
mountain
turnpike
company
extending
from
bellows
falls
to
rutland
from
to
and
worked
every
rod
of
that
road
many
times
over
from
our
earliest
boyhood
we
accompanied
him
on
these
working
trips
attended
by
a
large
force
of
laboring
men
and
our
attention
was
early
called
to
the
characteristics
of
these
rocks
the
rotting
slates
shales
sandstones
shists
and
rocks
of
various
kinds
were
often
ploughed
up
by
the
and
the
scraped
into
the
centre
of
the
the
heaviest
ploughs
of
that
day
being
used
to
cut
through
these
wayside
rocks
and
often
requiring
as
many
as
six
or
eight
yoke
of
oxen
to
break
the
necessary
furrow
in
many
of
these
decaying
slates
shists
sandstones
hundreds
of
young
toads
many
of
them
not
more
than
half
an
inch
in
length
were
turned
out
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
showing
that
they
were
produced
independently
of
any
parent
batrachian
there
being
no
trace
of
a
mother
toad
in
connection
with
them
the
parent
toads
bury
themselves
in
the
gardens
and
ploughed
fields
in
the
early
autumn
and
if
they
survive
the
severity
of
the
winter
months
may
propagate
their
kind
the
second
year
and
probably
for
several
years
but
they
require
remarkably
favorable
conditions
to
continue
their
life
for
any
considerable
number
of
years
in
propagation
while
under
no
circumstances
whatever
can
they
make
their
way
into
these
decaying
rocks
in
order
to
propagate
their
species
the
reason
why
such
fresh
specimens
appear
under
these
circumstances
and
in
the
cavities
of
the
rocks
named
is
conclusively
that
indicated
by
the
prophet
isaiah
in
the
text
quoted
by
us
and
when
professor
agassiz
was
forced
to
admit
that
trout
must
have
made
their
appearance
in
the
streams
emptying
into
lake
superior
instead
of
originating
elsewhere
it
is
to
be
regretted
for
the
sake
of
science
that
he
did
not
boldly
enunciate
the
formula
of
life
as
taught
by
the
prophet
of
the
bible
and
not
as
proclaimed
by
the
professors
of
the
london
university
college
what
is
true
of
the
trout
in
these
lake
superior
streams
is
true
of
them
almost
everywhere
even
right
in
the
town
of
cheshire
where
we
are
inditing
this
preface
the
day
of
october
we
recently
visited
the
rev
david
bishop
in
the
northeastern
portion
of
this
township
where
that
cultured
gentleman
was
constructing
an
artificial
it
was
at
a
season
of
the
greatest
drought
known
for
years
in
that
portion
of
the
town
the
point
selected
for
this
was
at
the
farthest
eastern
source
of
what
is
known
as
honey
pot
brook
in
cheshire
a
famous
one
for
trout
in
former
years
bishop
proposed
to
stock
his
pond
with
the
best
spawn
he
could
procure
we
remarked
to
him
that
there
was
no
need
of
that
expense
as
no
stream
ever
produced
better
trout
than
the
honey
pot
and
on
closely
examining
one
of
the
six
or
eight
cold
springs
developed
in
his
enclosure
to
his
surprise
not
ours
we
discovered
several
small
trout
not
more
than
six
weeks
old
as
lively
as
they
could
well
be
under
the
blasting
operations
then
going
on
there
while
his
children
were
fishing
out
from
the
rocks
any
number
of
young
frogs
of
the
common
family
abounding
wherever
rocks
and
water
make
their
appearance
in
similar
localities
this
incident
was
all
the
more
remarkable
for
the
reason
that
this
small
stream
or
rather
source
of
one
had
been
apparently
dry
for
months
as
had
been
many
of
the
best
wells
in
the
town
our
well
in
the
western
part
of
the
town
had
been
dug
some
six
feet
into
the
solid
rock
and
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
the
coldest
water
secured
we
invited
our
neighbors
those
living
on
both
sides
of
us
as
well
as
at
some
distance
from
us
to
come
and
draw
all
the
water
they
wanted
remarking
that
they
might
now
and
then
draw
up
a
small
frog
originating
therein
but
that
by
fishing
him
out
of
the
pail
he
would
make
his
way
to
the
neighboring
streams
not
dry
and
would
flourish
well
enough
as
one
of
the
family
it
was
only
to
our
more
intelligent
neighbors
such
as
bishop
who
had
read
our
work
on
life
that
we
stopped
to
explain
this
phenomenal
fact
and
so
of
all
life
wherever
it
appears
whether
vegetable
or
animal
our
experiments
with
mosquitoes
are
equally
conclusive
three
years
ago
we
took
two
barrels
of
from
our
cistern
tightly
covered
one
barrel
we
left
open
to
the
warm
sun
and
air
and
the
other
we
covered
with
the
finest
mosquito
netting
the
barrel
left
open
was
soon
thronged
with
mosquitoes
constructing
their
little
rafts
of
eggs
and
paving
their
way
for
the
swarms
of
young
wigglers
that
in
the
course
of
a
week
or
two
made
their
appearance
in
the
open
barrel
in
immense
numbers
the
process
by
which
these
wigglers
hatch
out
into
mosquitoes
is
an
interesting
one
and
will
bear
the
closest
study
as
well
as
scientifically
pay
for
watching
the
operation
at
the
proper
time
they
come
to
the
surface
of
the
water
undergo
a
palpable
modification
in
their
structure
and
beautifully
burgeon
forth
into
the
tormenting
little
insects
that
they
are
during
the
summer
and
autumn
months
in
our
northern
climate
the
object
of
the
covered
barrel
was
to
ascertain
whether
we
could
reach
the
conditions
favorable
for
the
development
of
this
little
pest
of
the
family
independently
of
the
eggs
of
the
insect
itself
this
required
some
patience
and
not
a
little
care
we
knew
that
an
egg
dropped
through
the
interstices
of
the
netting
would
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
water
and
fail
to
germinate
as
every
scientist
understanding
the
process
well
knows
it
must
be
floated
on
the
water
at
first
or
until
it
reaches
the
point
of
development
into
a
wiggler
the
first
step
in
the
process
of
its
life
is
as
cunningly
devised
as
the
second
and
the
second
as
the
third
until
the
mosquito
is
reached
all
precautions
must
be
taken
against
any
mistake
or
error
in
the
experiment
named
but
we
persevered
and
found
nature
responsive
to
our
demands
wigglers
after
awhile
made
their
appearance
sparsely
in
the
covered
barrel
but
the
mosquitoes
developed
from
them
proved
innocuous
of
harm
as
we
kept
the
barrel
covered
and
they
were
soon
drowned
in
the
water
not
having
sufficient
area
of
flight
to
answer
the
conditions
of
their
life
we
might
instance
some
remarkable
discoveries
in
the
vegetable
world
showing
conclusively
that
plants
and
trees
come
without
seed
and
we
feel
the
more
pride
in
this
discovery
because
we
have
been
assured
by
othniel
marsh
of
yale
college
a
gentleman
highly
distinguished
in
his
specialties
that
if
we
would
show
that
an
oak
tree
came
without
an
acorn
he
would
abandon
evolution
and
accept
the
exposition
given
by
us
of
the
bible
genesis
but
we
have
no
special
ambition
to
make
so
eminent
a
convert
from
herbert
spencer
ranks
he
is
a
much
younger
man
than
ourself
but
the
great
english
evolutionist
or
involutionist
whichever
he
may
ultimately
decide
to
call
himself
is
about
the
writer
own
age
and
for
special
reasons
he
would
prefer
to
win
him
to
the
vital
side
of
this
question
that
he
may
act
with
professor
beale
in
the
great
controversy
now
waging
in
england
on
this
subject
and
we
will
assure
both
marsh
and
his
friend
herbert
spencer
that
if
either
of
them
will
show
that
an
acorn
comes
without
an
oak
tree
we
will
abandon
any
position
we
have
taken
on
this
subject
and
accept
theirs
however
absurdly
to
our
mind
it
may
have
been
taken
in
the
past
we
know
that
tall
oaks
from
little
acorns
grow
but
that
is
when
man
becomes
the
sower
of
seed
and
knows
the
origin
of
each
specific
tree
that
is
brought
forth
when
we
talk
about
the
squirrel
or
the
birds
becoming
the
sowers
of
seeds
especially
the
acorns
we
are
talking
at
random
and
without
any
certain
knowledge
this
we
say
with
all
due
deference
and
respect
to
our
learned
agnostic
friends
and
wish
they
would
treat
their
vitalistic
brothers
with
the
same
becoming
courtesy
in
a
work
which
we
have
now
in
preparation
for
the
press
to
be
entitled
biodynamics
or
the
laws
of
life
we
shall
give
this
seed
question
a
more
exhaustive
inquiry
than
we
have
yet
done
our
proofs
in
regard
to
one
form
of
life
are
equally
applicable
to
any
other
plant
insect
or
animal
and
there
is
no
greater
or
less
mystery
in
the
life
of
a
blade
of
grass
than
in
the
cedar
of
lebanon
figuring
so
conspicuously
in
the
historic
page
when
the
nile
overflowed
its
banks
in
ancient
times
and
caused
the
young
frogs
to
swarm
up
as
a
pest
upon
the
egyptians
the
same
law
of
life
was
operative
in
that
land
as
when
warm
pelt
the
earth
with
us
in
the
summer
season
causing
hundreds
and
thousands
of
these
batrachians
to
come
out
of
the
gritty
waysides
and
swarm
along
our
highways
and
leading
ignorant
and
thoughtless
people
to
suppose
that
they
have
rained
down
from
the
sky
the
simple
fact
is
that
the
earth
was
commanded
to
bring
them
forth
and
that
great
mother
of
all
vegetable
and
animal
life
is
obeying
the
command
just
as
she
did
in
the
beginning
one
of
the
greatest
errors
that
science
has
yet
committed
or
rather
that
scientific
men
have
stumbled
upon
is
the
theory
that
all
living
forms
have
appeared
but
once
in
time
and
place
and
that
they
have
thence
diffused
themselves
in
pairs
throughout
the
globe
as
from
specific
centres
of
origin
in
the
primeval
oceans
whenever
and
wherever
the
environing
conditions
of
matter
were
the
same
or
identical
the
like
living
forms
made
their
appearance
and
flourished
for
hundreds
and
thousands
of
years
and
finally
disappeared
in
a
fossilized
state
as
their
environing
conditions
were
changed
they
came
not
genetically
as
in
pairs
but
thronged
the
seas
in
thousands
and
millions
as
the
divine
edict
went
forth
as
another
conclusive
proof
to
our
mind
of
the
existence
of
this
law
of
life
we
instance
the
case
of
the
growing
in
the
west
india
islands
especially
along
the
where
it
becomes
the
natural
of
the
oyster
it
is
the
belief
of
some
ignorant
persons
that
the
oyster
climbs
these
trees
and
deposits
its
spawn
or
spat
upon
the
extreme
limbs
of
the
same
as
they
bend
down
toward
the
water
this
is
manifestly
an
error
and
belongs
to
the
same
class
of
fallacies
as
the
common
impression
that
toads
rain
down
from
the
sky
the
smaller
growing
about
the
bays
and
inlets
of
these
islands
furnish
as
we
have
said
a
natural
for
the
oyster
and
as
the
salt
washes
their
roots
and
the
bark
of
their
trunks
the
long
oysters
of
that
region
make
their
appearance
thereon
without
the
presence
of
spawn
just
as
they
do
when
old
are
dumped
along
our
in
new
england
on
these
dumped
shells
oysters
will
be
produced
abundantly
simply
because
the
conditions
are
favorable
and
not
in
consequence
of
the
presence
of
spat
oysters
have
little
if
any
locomotive
power
and
can
no
more
climb
the
than
they
can
scale
the
cliffs
of
the
azores
the
reason
why
they
hang
in
pendent
clusters
from
the
extreme
boughs
of
the
mango
in
the
west
india
islands
is
that
these
boughs
are
sprayed
upon
by
the
rippling
waters
and
the
environing
conditions
being
favorable
the
indifferent
oyster
of
that
region
makes
its
appearance
there
has
been
no
migration
of
the
oyster
from
one
centre
of
origin
to
another
any
more
than
there
has
been
a
transference
of
the
white
whale
from
the
arctic
seas
to
the
fiery
equator
every
thing
has
its
place
in
nature
and
comes
with
or
without
seed
as
natural
laws
determine
during
the
last
year
i
have
gathered
cedar
trees
that
did
not
make
their
appearance
till
late
in
august
and
september
long
after
the
seed
of
the
previous
year
had
entirely
disappeared
and
there
was
no
more
life
in
them
than
there
is
in
acorns
that
have
crossed
the
atlantic
a
dozen
times
in
bulk
and
the
late
henry
thoreau
in
his
excursions
says
that
they
will
not
stand
one
such
shipment
to
europe
and
that
every
acorn
that
does
not
sprout
by
the
end
of
november
of
the
year
it
matures
is
hopelessly
a
dead
acorn
this
is
in
harmony
with
our
experience
and
we
have
no
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
his
observations
how
absurd
then
to
suppose
that
acorns
can
retain
their
vitality
so
as
to
germinate
after
years
of
or
other
exposure
the
seeds
of
that
mature
in
may
and
june
or
the
majority
of
them
at
least
have
to
be
planted
in
those
months
as
all
persons
engaged
in
forest
culture
well
know
this
is
specially
true
of
cedars
and
oaks
as
well
as
of
elms
and
maples
study
the
paleontological
facts
as
given
by
frederick
mccoy
of
the
university
of
melbourne
in
australia
a
gentleman
highly
distinguished
for
his
learning
and
research
he
has
explored
portions
of
that
continent
as
far
down
as
the
azoic
rocks
and
made
many
important
discoveries
as
to
the
past
life
of
the
globe
his
researches
have
been
especially
rich
in
the
cambrian
or
lower
silurian
epochs
and
have
led
to
many
modifications
in
the
classification
of
the
various
forms
of
life
pervading
those
earlier
periods
and
we
may
say
that
the
facts
he
has
brought
to
light
tend
strongly
to
show
the
correctness
of
our
theory
as
taken
from
the
biblical
text
as
for
instance
the
occurring
so
abundantly
in
what
is
known
as
the
utica
slates
wherever
the
slates
make
their
appearance
whether
in
australia
america
or
any
portion
of
europe
this
fossil
characteristic
of
the
silurian
and
devonian
systems
appeared
not
so
much
in
time
and
place
as
in
extended
localities
and
conditions
indicating
the
presence
of
a
law
of
life
such
as
we
have
enunciated
we
once
inquired
of
the
elder
silliman
how
long
it
took
for
the
formation
of
one
of
these
periods
or
systems
his
reply
was
curt
and
pertinent
it
took
long
enough
young
man
that
satisfied
us
at
the
time
and
we
have
never
asked
the
question
since
it
is
prying
beyond
scientific
depth
and
the
ablest
scholars
in
the
world
will
so
regard
it
in
the
end
all
fossils
follow
the
same
developmental
law
and
seem
to
have
been
governed
by
corresponding
conditions
everywhere
the
doctrine
of
similibus
similar
conditions
producing
similar
forms
obtains
universally
the
occurring
in
the
bituminous
shales
of
the
silurian
sandstone
period
afford
only
another
instance
of
the
same
law
to
which
we
have
called
the
attention
of
our
readers
in
fact
the
annals
of
natural
history
abound
in
the
most
conclusive
proofs
as
well
in
the
fossilized
as
the
living
world
of
what
the
paramount
text
of
the
bible
teaches
us
when
professor
ehrenberg
one
of
the
most
distinguished
classifiers
of
minute
forms
of
life
in
the
world
declared
as
he
recently
did
before
the
royal
geographical
society
of
london
that
there
was
a
great
invisible
life
in
nature
he
came
pretty
near
enunciating
a
great
truth
in
science
and
had
he
connected
his
language
with
the
induction
of
environing
conditions
and
the
sequence
of
life
therefrom
he
would
have
accomplished
what
we
undertook
to
do
in
our
work
begun
several
years
ago
but
not
completed
and
published
until
for
it
will
be
seen
that
we
had
been
gathering
the
material
for
life
its
true
genesis
for
many
years
before
we
sat
down
to
the
task
of
writing
it
when
we
said
to
one
of
our
most
intimate
college
friends
that
we
were
less
than
six
months
preparing
it
for
the
press
we
stated
what
was
literally
true
but
we
had
no
intention
of
giving
him
to
understand
that
we
had
spent
only
that
time
in
gathering
the
vast
amount
of
material
at
our
command
twenty
times
as
much
as
we
could
possibly
use
in
the
preparation
of
such
a
volume
for
the
press
the
long
months
and
even
years
of
toil
and
study
spent
by
us
in
the
needful
preparation
were
a
part
of
the
labor
as
every
author
writing
intelligently
on
any
subject
knows
the
immense
amount
of
care
and
labor
that
enabled
hermann
von
meyer
to
prepare
his
paper
on
the
rescued
from
the
lithographic
slate
is
a
case
in
point
as
showing
how
small
apparently
the
labor
of
accomplishing
a
great
work
for
science
the
time
devoted
to
preparing
the
paper
was
trifling
as
compared
with
the
result
of
his
achievement
and
so
with
every
one
who
enters
the
temple
of
science
with
a
devout
wish
to
attain
success
it
will
be
apparent
to
the
religious
mind
of
this
country
and
england
if
not
to
that
of
tyndall
himself
that
if
the
exegetical
rendering
we
have
extended
to
the
bible
be
correct
there
is
no
necessity
whatever
for
the
vast
uncomputed
periods
of
time
intervening
the
different
geological
strata
to
which
that
scientific
gentleman
refers
in
his
fanciful
musings
upon
the
matterhorn
nor
is
there
any
such
necessity
for
it
if
what
professor
ehrenberg
says
be
true
in
regard
to
the
basaltic
rocks
thrown
up
by
volcanic
action
in
the
island
of
paul
for
if
these
rocks
possess
this
mysterious
power
of
life
he
who
made
them
manifestly
imparted
it
one
thing
is
certain
at
least
the
rocks
did
not
make
themselves
nor
did
they
impart
to
themselves
any
power
after
they
were
made
the
same
power
that
originated
them
originated
all
their
characteristic
properties
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
professor
tyndall
or
any
other
mistier
name
suggested
by
scientific
men
we
have
only
to
take
the
thesaurus
of
the
silurian
period
and
connect
it
with
the
induction
of
the
biblical
text
and
we
shall
see
that
the
forms
characteristic
of
that
period
appeared
not
only
synchronously
in
time
and
space
but
also
in
physical
conditions
and
consequently
that
no
immense
epochs
were
expended
in
the
propagation
of
species
on
the
theory
of
our
materialistic
friends
they
simply
flourished
over
vast
areas
for
a
while
and
were
then
locked
up
as
fossils
where
they
are
now
found
how
long
it
took
for
this
transformation
to
take
place
is
manifestly
beyond
any
data
we
may
now
have
for
determining
in
the
case
of
some
artificial
baths
in
which
crystalline
forms
appear
we
know
that
it
takes
only
a
few
weeks
at
least
and
why
should
natural
processes
be
any
more
delinquent
or
defective
in
their
operation
than
those
that
are
purely
artificial
remember
that
we
are
not
musing
on
the
matterhorn
as
was
the
gifted
english
naturalist
but
upon
the
text
of
the
equally
gifted
isaiah
and
pondering
the
works
of
god
as
seen
by
the
devout
prophet
in
his
day
when
tyndall
can
tell
us
how
long
it
took
god
to
lift
the
towering
matterhorn
from
its
base
he
will
be
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
answer
the
other
problems
involved
in
the
controversy
between
us
in
an
instant
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
some
of
these
phenomena
have
occurred
and
recent
events
such
as
wide
volcanic
disturbances
show
how
idle
it
is
for
man
to
place
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
most
high
even
the
red
snow
unmistakably
a
vegetal
formation
appearing
at
times
on
the
loftier
alps
is
as
much
a
proof
of
god
power
as
the
ragged
mountain
peaks
on
which
it
appears
covering
vast
areas
within
a
few
hours
time
when
such
men
as
the
late
professor
silliman
and
professor
dana
of
yale
college
take
up
the
bible
genesis
and
speak
in
high
commendation
of
its
value
to
science
it
is
idle
for
the
agnostics
of
that
or
any
other
institution
of
learning
to
speak
sneeringly
of
their
efforts
they
both
know
for
the
elder
benjamin
silliman
still
lives
that
the
first
command
of
this
genesis
was
for
the
earth
to
bring
forth
its
vegetation
not
from
seed
distinctively
but
from
the
germinal
principles
of
life
therein
what
ehrenberg
calls
the
life
or
power
of
life
in
matter
that
the
second
command
was
for
the
waters
of
the
earth
to
bring
forth
their
specific
forms
of
life
including
the
birds
just
where
science
now
asserts
they
originally
came
from
and
that
the
third
command
was
for
the
earth
to
bring
forth
the
beasts
thereof
and
every
creeping
thing
thereon
here
the
power
of
life
ceased
and
the
language
of
the
genesis
changes
it
is
no
longer
let
the
earth
bring
forth
but
let
the
divine
energy
intervene
let
us
the
divine
trinity
in
unity
make
man
in
our
own
image
after
our
own
conception
of
what
he
should
be
the
being
of
two
worlds
the
material
and
spiritual
and
man
was
made
accordingly
god
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
and
he
became
a
living
soul
this
is
the
record
brief
grand
historic
no
evolution
no
involution
no
word
without
sense
or
meaning
he
who
was
to
have
dominion
in
his
limited
sphere
over
all
the
earth
thus
came
in
due
time
for
a
wiser
and
grander
purpose
than
man
has
yet
seen
but
which
in
the
providence
of
god
and
the
light
of
his
word
he
will
yet
come
to
see
as
scientific
truth
advances
with
the
march
of
religious
knowledge
heaven
speed
the
day
when
this
millennium
of
truth
shall
dawn
upon
us
here
in
this
remarkable
genesis
we
have
a
bridge
that
spans
the
chasm
between
the
man
and
the
anthropoid
ape
as
no
other
bridge
spans
it
it
is
a
bridge
over
which
is
flung
the
living
garment
of
god
and
angelic
hosts
may
pass
it
to
and
fro
as
well
as
the
of
our
own
and
future
ages
it
takes
man
out
of
the
category
of
a
beast
of
the
earth
and
places
him
where
all
lifts
us
lifts
even
robert
ingersoll
in
his
higher
inspirational
moods
or
will
lift
him
when
his
extreme
material
dogmatisms
and
false
teachings
desert
him
as
we
trust
they
some
day
will
let
him
read
the
student
by
bulwer
and
he
will
learn
how
narrowly
voltaire
escaped
becoming
a
reformer
in
the
church
of
england
instead
of
the
violent
antagonist
he
was
of
the
corrupt
church
of
rome
in
france
we
do
not
make
ourselves
it
is
the
environing
circumstances
and
conditions
in
which
we
are
placed
which
oftentimes
determine
our
career
for
good
or
for
evil
we
had
proposed
embodying
in
this
preface
one
or
two
caustic
reviews
of
our
late
work
from
an
agnostic
source
but
have
been
deterred
from
so
doing
for
the
reason
that
we
deem
it
in
bad
taste
as
well
as
irrelevant
at
this
late
day
we
shall
be
pardoned
however
in
alluding
to
national
quarterly
for
the
captious
manner
in
which
it
treated
us
after
we
had
courteously
replied
to
several
inquiries
made
of
us
in
its
or
review
after
complaining
that
we
had
been
hailed
by
a
class
of
callow
religious
critics
as
a
from
scientific
error
and
enormities
it
charged
us
with
certain
unscrupulous
methods
of
criticism
such
as
putting
language
into
darwin
mouth
that
he
never
thought
of
uttering
etc
and
as
this
pretentious
quarterly
put
several
questions
to
us
such
as
when
and
where
the
great
evolutionist
had
taught
any
such
doctrine
as
this
we
ventured
to
reply
as
courteously
as
we
knew
how
we
endeavored
to
treat
our
reviewer
fairly
as
he
had
handsomely
accorded
to
us
the
credit
of
searching
the
fields
of
natural
science
lance
in
hand
to
deal
hard
thrusts
at
impious
skeptics
materialists
and
evolutionists
of
which
darwin
and
bastian
fare
the
most
severely
but
we
had
no
thought
of
using
these
offensive
adjectives
toward
either
of
the
distinguished
gentlemen
named
and
did
not
so
use
them
however
unscrupulous
our
methods
may
have
been
in
other
respects
our
reply
was
unnoticed
by
the
bulky
quarterly
and
we
were
content
with
knowing
that
it
was
received
by
its
editor
and
shared
the
fate
of
all
intrusive
communications
which
it
is
easier
to
throw
into
the
especially
in
hot
weather
than
to
answer
in
the
interests
of
science
when
such
answers
are
difficult
to
be
made
this
was
the
first
and
only
discussion
we
attempted
to
provoke
with
our
exhaustive
reviewers
and
it
will
in
all
probability
be
the
last
little
is
gained
by
these
polemical
controversies
when
conducted
in
the
spirit
of
unfairness
or
with
greater
asperity
than
the
true
interests
of
journalism
demand
the
beauty
of
its
kindly
advice
to
us
as
a
scientific
critic
was
that
every
word
of
it
came
back
as
a
cruel
boomerang
into
the
writer
own
face
but
this
is
enough
for
the
last
three
years
we
have
been
mostly
engaged
in
writing
another
book
the
character
of
which
is
already
sufficiently
indicated
in
this
preface
the
reasons
why
we
have
been
led
to
adhere
to
our
original
purpose
of
making
this
a
bible
genesis
as
national
quarterly
speaks
of
it
are
best
known
to
our
more
intimate
friends
and
we
do
not
propose
to
disappoint
them
in
their
expectations
if
we
have
failed
to
make
our
theory
understood
by
others
we
regret
it
if
others
fail
to
understand
the
inspired
text
it
is
manifestly
a
matter
for

their

we

we

prefatory
the
office
of
a
preface
is
twofold
first
to
introduce
the
author
to
the
public
second
to
introduce
his
work
as
the
writer
seeks
no
personal
introduction
beyond
what
a
favorable
or
unfavorable
reception
of
his
work
may
give
him
he
leaves
the
more
formal
if
not
formidable
branch
of
salutation
untouched
the
work
has
cost
him
some
labor
as
the
reader
will
see
the
field
he
has
traversed
is
vast
and
varied
and
the
facts
he
has
gathered
are
numerous
and
from
many
and
diversified
sources
all
bearing
more
or
less
conclusively
on
the
one
vital
point
he
seeks
to
establish
viz
the
primordial
germs
meaning
germinal
principles
of
life
of
all
living
things
man
alone
excepted
are
in
themselves
upon
the
earth
and
that
they
severally
make
their
appearance
each
after
its
kind
whenever
and
wherever
the
necessary
environing
conditions
the
foundation
of
this
emphatic
formula
we
find
in
the
bible
genesis
in
the
words
given
on
our
which
are
more
accurately
translated
in
the
septuagint
than
in
our
common
english
version
of
the
old
testament
the
words
are
to
be
found
in
the
verse
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
and
the
writer
confidently
believes
that
they
contain
the
true
genesis
of
life
although
entirely
overlooked
heretofore
by
both
the
biblical
and
scientific
scholar
in
the
work
which
he
here
gives
to
the
public
he
will
endeavor
to
show
that
all
the
vital
phenomena
of
our
globe
with
the
single
exception
named
find
their
complete
explication
in
this
genesis
of
life
and
that
we
have
only
to
take
the
scientific
genesis
out
of
some
of
its
more
imposing
categories
to
make
the
two
either
entirely
harmonize
or
fall
into
the
same
lines
of
incidence
in
human
thought
science
has
long
taught
that
the
of
necessary
physiological
conditions
results
everywhere
in
the
of
vital
phenomena
by
reversing
its
logical
methods
it
will
also
find
that
the
of
these
necessary
conditions
results
everywhere
in
the
of
vital
phenomena
take
for
instance
the
vegetation
of
northern
europe
where
it
is
known
that
the
oak
succeeded
the
pine
and
the
beech
the
oak
after
each
had
held
possession
of
the
soil
for
we
know
not
how
many
thousand
years
in
bringing
about
the
necessary
conditions
of
soil
the
pine
paved
the
way
for
the
oak
and
that
in
turn
paved
the
way
for
the
beech
neither
sprang
from
the
other
nor
did
the
selection
of
the
fittest
have
anything
to
do
with
the
appearance
or
disappearance
of
either
each
yielded
fruit
after
his
kind
whose
seed
germinal
principle
of
life
was
in
itself
after
its
own
kind
upon
the
earth
and
made
its
appearance
spontaneously
that
is
without
the
presence
of
natural
seed
whenever
the
necessary
environing
conditions
favored
and
the
same
law
of
vegetal
propagation
is
everywhere
operative
in
the
alternations
of
forest
growths
the
spontaneous
appearance
of
oak
forests
where
pine
have
been
cleared
away
and
in
some
parts
of
the
country
where
heavy
forests
of
oak
timber
have
been
felled
so
with
the
new
growths
of
timber
springing
up
in
the
paths
of
tornadoes
over
large
burnt
districts
in
soils
brought
up
from
below
the
last
glacial
drift
and
in
hundreds
of
other
instances
which
the
reader
will
find
conclusively
verified
in
these
pages
all
making
their
appearance
without
the
possible
intervention
of
natural
seeds
the
great
value
of
the
septuagint
as
compared
with
other
versions
of
the
hebrew
bible
will
appear
from
the
fact
that
it
is
older
by
many
hundred
years
than
any
manuscript
copy
of
the
hebrew
text
now
extant
it
was
undoubtedly
translated
at
alexandria
in
egypt
as
early
as
the
third
century
before
christ
while
the
oldest
known
hebrew
is
a
pentateuch
roll
dating
no
further
back
than
its
translators
had
before
them
much
older
and
more
perfect
mss
than
any
that
survived
to
the
time
of
the
masoretic
recension
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
give
uniformity
to
the
readings
and
renderings
of
the
hebrew
text
by
means
of
the
vowel
points
diacritical
signs
terminal
letters
all
of
which
are
now
subject
to
rejection
by
the
best
oriental
scholarship
according
to
irenæus
this
greek
version
was
rendered
at
the
request
of
ptolemy
lagi
in
order
to
add
to
the
treasures
of
the
alexandrian
library
and
it
no
doubt
derived
its
name
from
the
number
of
hebrew
and
hellenistic
scholars
probably
the
most
eminent
to
be
found
in
that
day
employed
upon
the
work
the
version
comes
therefore
with
paramount
authority
to
our
own
times
and
we
accept
its
greek
rendering
as
the
highest
and
most
conclusive
evidence
of
the
authenticity
of
the
text
and
the
new
genesis
of
life
we
derive
therefrom
σπέρμα
as
contained
in
the
septuagint
has
almost
an
identical
signification
with
the
hebrew
word
zra
it
means
the
of
anything
or
the
germinal
principle
of
life
as
contained
in
anything
that
lives
or
grows
no
one
will
claim
that
it
is
used
in
its
literal
sense
of
seed
in
the
text
for
when
the
divine
command
was
issued
there
was
no
plant
or
tree
and
presumably
had
been
none
upon
the
earth
from
which
seed
could
have
been
derived
the
word
was
used
in
its
larger
and
more
comprehensive
that
is
metaphorical
sense
as
the
germinal
principle
of
life
in
matter
or
precisely
in
the
sense
in
which
the
greek
stoics
used
it
in
their
philosophy
both
theophrastus
and
diogenes
use
the
terms
γόγοι
expressing
the
of
generation
contained
in
precisely
the
meaning
we
attach
to
it
in
its
textual
connection
the
eleventh
verse
should
read
therefore
as
follows
let
the
earth
bring
forth
grass
the
herb
yielding
seed
and
the
yielding
fruit
after
his
kind
germinal
principle
of
life
each
in
itself
after
its
kind
is
upon
the
we
accept
this
rendering
of
the
seventy
because
they
had
the
most
complete
and
perfect
hebrew
mss
before
them
and
were
no
doubt
better
scholars
and
far
more
competent
renderers
of
the
original
text
than
the
masorites
who
came
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
years
after
them
but
this
is
not
the
most
important
point
of
inquiry
in
this
connection
the
materialistic
objector
may
say
admit
all
this
grant
that
the
true
rendering
is
here
given
grant
even
that
the
true
law
of
vegetal
development
and
growth
is
here
enunciated
what
has
science
to
do
with
the
we
answer
nothing
we
would
bury
both
theological
rancor
and
atheistical
pretension
in
the
same
barrow
and
agree
never
to
peep
and
botanize
over
their
common
grave
but
if
a
great
scientific
principle
one
that
fits
into
all
the
phenomenal
facts
of
nature
explains
them
all
and
is
in
turn
explained
by
them
be
found
in
the
hebrew
of
what
less
value
is
it
to
science
than
if
it
had
been
originally
enunciated
by
aristotle
or
plato
or
to
make
the
inquiry
still
sharper
and
more
emphatic
of
what
less
value
is
it
to
science
than
if
it
had
originally
come
from
professor
tyndall
or
herbert
spencer
take
the
biblical
genesis
as
we
have
enunciated
and
explained
it
with
all
the
facts
crowded
into
these
explanatory
pages
and
science
has
no
longer
any
genetic
mystery
to
brood
over
further
than
that
every
operation
of
nature
is
a
mystery
into
which
it
is
useless
for
scientific
speculation
to
pry
we
know
what
nature
or
may
know
it
by
the
proper
scrutiny
but
we
shall
never
know
the
causes
of
things
any
more
than
we
shall
find
god
at
the
bottom
of
herbert
spencer
crucible
or
at
the
top
of
his
ladder
of
synthesis
in
the
light
of
the
bible
genesis
science
can
account
for
the
origin
of
the
stalwart
oak
or
the
lordly
pine
without
going
back
to
any
mycological
or
cryptogamic
forms
to
follow
down
an
vital
plexus
that
is
as
likely
to
land
in
a

as
an
oak

in

quite
as
likely
to
land

conn

chapter
i
introductory
it
is
undeniably
true
that
the
progress
of
scientific
thought
and
speculative
inquiry
both
in
this
country
and
in
europe
is
rapidly
tending
towards
a
purely
materialistic
view
of
the
universe
or
one
that
utterly
excludes
the
ancient
and
metaphysical
conceptions
of
life
to
say
nothing
of
the
more
regnant
and
universally
prevailing
conception
of
a
god
and
it
is
quite
as
undeniable
that
the
current
of
experimental
research
and
investigation
is
setting
with
equal
rapidity
in
the
same
direction
according
to
the
views
of
many
of
our
more
advanced
chemists
physiologists
and
other
scientific
and
speculative
writers
and
thinkers
those
whose
experimental
investigations
have
it
is
claimed
reached
the
ultimate
implications
of
all
material
substance
there
are
but
two
immutable
indestructible
and
thoroughly
persistent
elements
in
the
universe
and
everything
else
they
confidently
assert
is
either
purely
phenomenal
or
else
essentially
mutable
ephemeral
transitory
force
according
to
their
theory
is
only
another
name
for
motion
or
its
correlates
and
hence
the
two
terms
are
interchangeably
used
by
them
in
predicating
their
ultimate
conclusions
respecting
matter
light
heat
electricity
magnetism
chemical
affinity
molecular
force
and
even
life
itself
are
only
so
many
manifestations
or
expressions
they
claim
of
one
and
the
same
force
in
the
universe
with
the
exception
of
matter
it
is
the
only
permanently
enduring
ever
active
and
reactive
agency
light
they
say
is
dependent
heat
conditional
electricity
and
magnetism
more
or
less
phenomenal
chemical
affinity
and
molecular
force
mere
modes
or
correlated
forms
of
motion
and
life
itself
a
mere
postulate
of
the
schools
or
at
best
only
the
result
of
the
dynamic
force
of
molecules
deem
not
this
collocation
simply
a
burlesque
on
scientific
categories
professor
bastian
in
his
great
work
on
the
beginnings
of
life
has
unhesitatingly
said
the
must
give
up
their
last
stronghold
we
can
not
even
grant
them
a
right
to
assume
the
existence
of
a
special
force
whose
peculiar
office
it
is
to
effect
the
transformation
of
physical
forces
the
notion
that
such
a
force
does
exist
is
based
on
no
evidence
it
is
a
mere
postulate
the
assumption
of
its
existence
carries
with
it
nothing
but
confusion
and
contradiction
because
the
very
supposition
that
it
exists
and
does
so
act
is
totally
averse
to
the
general
doctrine
of
the
correlation
of
forces
and
this
defiant
challenger
of
the
vitalists
who
thus
speaks
of
those
who
believe
that
the
vital
forces
of
the
universe
are
among
the
highest
potential
factors
expressed
therein
is
one
who
for
the
last
decade
and
a
half
has
mostly
lived
in
the
ephemeromorphic
world
and
who
in
diving
into
the
beginnings
of
life
has
so
far
lost
his
way
that
the
end
of
it
is
as
much
an
inexplicable
mystery
to
him
now
as
when
he
was
more
successfully
expounding
pathological
anatomy
and
ruthlessly
hacking
away
at
anatomical
subjects
over
the
of
the
london
university
college
had
he
spent
less
time
over
this
and
more
in
studying
the
marvellous
manifestations
of
life
in
its
outspoken
beauty
of
leaf
bud
flower
fruit
things
of
not
mere
guess
and
fancy
he
would
undoubtedly
have
had
a
higher
appreciation
of
what
is
most
vital
in
nature
and
less
of
what
is
simply
material
in
a
sense
with
herbert
spencer
he
gratuitously
sneers
at
the
old
hypothesis
or
the
divine
fiat
in
the
beginning
but
without
that
fiat
where
would
he
find
his
ephemeromorphs
or
even
the
dead
tissues
used
in
his
organic
infusions
for
the
vainest
of
all
human
endeavors
that
of
producing
life
or
seeking
to
produce
it
he
is
so
immeasurably
disgusted
with
the
vitalists
that
he
hardly
allows
himself
to
speak
of
life
or
even
use
the
term
vital
as
applied
to
its
simplest
manifestations
without
quotationizing
them
as
terms
to
provoke
both
incredulity
and
derision
the
world
may
however
overlook
much
of
this
in
him
in
view
of
his
past
professional
pursuits
as
well
as
in
consideration
of
his
eminent
services
as
a
specialist
in
science
the
of
a
university
is
not
the
most
desirable
place
in
the
world
for
profoundly
studying
the
vital
forces
of
nature
it
is
too
grim
and
ghastly
a
repository
of
dead
men
skulls
and
holes
where
eyes
did
once
inhabit
in
which
to
regard
enchanting
cup
as
one
sparkling
to
the
brim
detaching
a
muscle
here
and
laying
bare
another
there
taking
out
a
sightless
eye
in
one
subject
and
putting
the
deep
into
the
pulseless
heart
of
another
cutting
the
fragments
of
a
human
body
into
shreds
and
tatters
over
one
and
loading
down
another
with
splintered
bones
and
mangled
hands
and
limbs
is
not
exactly
the
sort
of
occupation
to
enkindle
the
highest
enthusiasm
for
life
in
any
of
its
more
manifold
phases
in
nature
too
many
lifeless
notions
get
crammed
into
the
head
to
say
nothing
of
baffled
endeavor
in
the
pursuit
to
admit
of
the
more
conclusive
and
satisfactory
inductions
respecting
living
organisms
but
why
should
an
assumption
of
the
existence
of
life
carry
with
it
any
greater
confusion
and
contradiction
than
a
like
assumption
respecting
either
matter
or
motion
simply
because
the
materialists
insist
in
their
logical
inductions
upon
so
distributing
the
terms
of
their
syllogism
that
only
a
negative
conclusion
shall
follow
matter
and
motion
they
say
are
alone
indestructible
life
is
neither
matter
nor
motion
therefore
life
is
not
indestructible
this
syllogism
is
manifestly
unanswerable
if
there
be
no
fallacy
in
the
distribution
of
its
major
and
minor
terms
but
wherein
lies
the
incompatibility
of
reversing
the
order
of
its
terms
so
as
to
prove
that
neither
matter
nor
motion
is
indestructible
and
would
such
a
judgment
thus
derived
be
any
more
spurious
the
process
of
reasoning
any
more
illicit
or
the
conclusion
any
less
unanswerable
we
might
as
well
say
that
neither
matter
nor
motion
is
an
absolute
entity
in
the
universe
without
some
apprehensive
intelligence
or
rational
intuition
therein
to
embrace
them
as
distinct
concepts
or
objects
of
thought
nor
can
either
have
the
least
conceivable
attribute
without
some
intelligence
to
ascribe
it
for
to
ascribe
an
attribute
is
to
conceive
or
think
of
such
attribute
and
as
our
general
conceptions
are
conceded
to
be
realities
even
by
the
materialists
themselves
it
necessarily
follows
that
this
conscious
this
thing
that
conceives
thinks
ascribes
attributes
is
either
with
matter
or
else
antedates
it
in
the
order
of
existence
and
here
at
this
identical
point
in
the
argument
we
are
irresistibly
forced
back
in
our
inductive
processes
to
the
theological
conception
of
a
god
the
one
supreme
of
the
universe
from
whom
alone
all
our
intuitions
of
consciousness
as
well
as
apprehensive
intelligence
is
derived
we
can
no
more
get
rid
of
these
inductive
processes
than
we
can
change
the
order
of
nature
or
reverse
the
inevitable
laws
of
thought
hence
we
are
constantly
driven
to
formulate
the
following
or
some
equivalent
inductions
cause
must
exist
before
effect
without
some
vital
principle
therefore
preëxisting
as
a
cause
there
can
be
no
but
there
can
be
no
without
organic
structure
the
reverse
of
this
proposition
is
also
true
which
therefore
precedes
the
other
as
a
cause
and
which
follows
as
an
effect
nothing
can
organize
itself
to
do
so
it
must
contain
within
itself
both
the
operating
cause
and
the
resulting
effect
which
is
at
once
an
incongruent
and
conflictive
judgment
but
the
thing
that
organizes
must
exist
before
the
thing
organized
whether
it
be
a
vital
principle
or
an
intelligent
agency
hence
life
either
as
a
preëxisting
cause
or
vital
agency
must
precede
both
animal
and
vegetal
organism
again
cause
is
that
which
operates
to
produce
an
effect
as
effect
is
that
which
is
produced
by
an
operating
cause
but
whatever
operates
to
produce
a
must
precede
it
as
an
operating
cause
life
therefore
whether
as
a
blind
or
intelligent
force
or
agency
must
precede
its
own
manifestation
that
is
must
exist
as
an
operating
cause
before
there
is
any
produced
effect
and
this
is
true
both
as
regards
physical
and
moral
effects
our
intuitions
as
the
final
arbiters
of
judgment
demand
this
or
some
equivalent
order
as
the
only
one
embraced
in
a
logical
praxis
and
since
there
can
be
no
sound
without
an
ear
to
appreciate
it
so
there
be
can
no
matter
without
an
existing
in
some
state
of
consciousness
in
the
universe
to
apprehend
it
to
ascribe
to
it
attributes
on
what
therefore
are
we
to
predicate
the
existence
of
either
matter
or
motion
except
it
be
these
intuitions
of
consciousness
whose
validity
so
far
as
we
have
any
knowledge
whatever
on
the
subject
rests
exclusively
on
that
breath
of
life
which
was
breathed
into
man
when
he
became
a
living
soul
but
if
our
intuitions
are
not
realities
then
nothing
is
a
reality
all
is
as
unsubstantial
as
vague
and
shadowy
as
coleridge
image
of
a
rock
or
bishop
berkeley
ghost
of
a
departed
quantity
as
he
once
defined
a
fluxion
we
may
therefore
retort
upon
professor
bastian
the
materialists
must
give
up
their
last
stronghold
we
can
not
even
grant
them
a
right
to
assume
the
existence
of
either
matter
or
motion
since
both
manifestly
depend
for
their
slightest
manifestation
upon
the
more
potent
agency
of
vital
force
as
expressed
in
thought
volition
and
consciousness
that
triumvirate
of
the
intellectual
faculties
without
which
neither
matter
nor
motion
could
have
so
much
as
a
hypothetical
existence
the
great
trouble
with
professor
bastian
as
with
herbert
spencer
is
that
he
advances
a
purely
materialistic
hypothesis
and
then
goes
to
work
with
his
quantitative
and
conditional
restrictions
to
eliminate
all
vital
force
from
the
universe
as
he
has
been
no
more
successful
in
finding
god
the
infinite
source
of
all
life
at
the
point
of
his
than
has
the
speculative
chemist
at
the
bottom
of
his
crucible
or
spencer
at
the
top
of
his
ladder
of
synthesis
he
resolutely
grapples
with
logic
as
a
last
resort
and
as
remorselessly
syllogizes
god
out
of
the
universe
as
he
would
a
mythological
demon
infecting
the
atmosphere
of
his
in
the
same
way
he
successfully
syllogizes
all
life
out
of
existence
although
in
the
very
act
of
constructing
his
syllogism
he
demonstrates
its
existence
as
conclusively
as
that
matter
and
motion
are
objective
realities
in
the
world
of
mind
and
matter
which
is
about
him
he
fails
to
see
however
that
the
thing
which
demonstrates
must
necessarily
precede
the
thing
demonstrated
as
life
must
necessarily
precede
its
manifestation
in
admitting
the
existence
of
vital
manifestation
therefore
he
virtually
admits
an
antecedent
vital
principle
lying
back
of
an
effect
as
a
cause
which
must
exclude
anything
like
a
contradictory
judgment
so
long
as
the
laws
of
the
human
mind
in
respect
to
logical
antecedents
and
consequents
remain
as
they
are
whatever
may
be
the
alleged
inaccuracies
of
the
bible
genesis
or
the
disputes
heretofore
indulged
in
respecting
the
or
sacred
writings
of
the
jews
it
will
hardly
be
denied
by
the
biblical
scholar
that
some
of
the
most
important
discoveries
in
modern
science
especially
in
the
direction
of
astronomy
as
well
as
in
geological
research
and
inquiry
confirm
rather
than
throw
doubt
upon
their
more
explicit
utterances
this
has
been
so
marked
a
feature
in
the
controversy
that
whenever
scientific
speculation
has
thrown
down
any
fresh
gage
of
battle
as
against
the
validity
of
these
sacred
writings
the
advocates
of
the
latter
have
only
had
to
take
it
up
to
dispel
the
mists
of
controversy
and
achieve
a
more
conclusive
triumph
than
ever
for
the
truth
of
this
statement
it
is
only
necessary
for
us
to
instance
a
few
of
the
more
important
facts
contained
in
the
bible
genesis
and
should
it
be
found
that
the
writer
of
this
volume
has
discovered
in
a
long
overlooked
much
neglected
and
inaccurately
translated
passage
of
this
genesis
a
key
that
unlocks
the
whole
mystery
of
life
as
the
great
battle
is
now
waging
between
the
materialists
and
vitalists
of
this
country
and
europe
it
will
most
conclusively
establish
the
point
we
shall
here
make
that
in
no
equally
limited
compass
in
ancient
or
modern
manuscript
or
published
volume
since
the
first
dawn
of
letters
to
the
present
time
are
there
to
be
found
so
many
conclusively
established
facts
of
genuine
scientific
value
as
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
in
dispelling
the
mists
of
prejudice
and
possibly
of
doubtful
translation
let
us
look
this
genesis
squarely
in
the
face
take
the
statement
that
in
the
beginning
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
rested
upon
the
face
of
the
depths
here
is
not
only
no
conflict
with
science
but
the
great
suggestive
fact
which
led
laplace
to
construct
his
nebular
hypothesis
or
that
magnificent
system
of
which
regards
the
universe
as
originally
consisting
of
uniformly
diffused
matter
filling
all
space
and
hence
without
form
and
void
but
which
subsequently
became
aggregated
by
gravitation
into
an
infinite
number
of
occupying
inconceivably
vast
areas
in
space
nor
can
science
well
afford
to
cavil
at
that
other
most
important
suggestive
statement
that
the
spirit
of
god
the
great
formative
force
of
the
universe
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
depths
after
which
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
first
day
that
is
the
first
distinctive
epoch
in
the
order
of
creation
when
materialistic
science
shall
define
gravitation
the
supposed
aggregating
force
of
infinitely
diffused
matter
in
space
so
as
to
make
it
a
distinct
and
separate
factor
in
the
universe
from
the
spirit
of
god
that
spirit
which
was
breathed
into
man
when
he
became
a
living
soul
and
which
we
are
told
upholds
the
order
of
the
heavens
then
its
devotees
may
sneer
at
the
bible
genesis
and
the
logical
deductions
to
be
drawn
therefrom
again
science
can
have
no
conflict
with
the
bible
genesis
except
in
the
most
hypercritical
way
in
the
affirmative
statement
that
god
set
two
great
lights
in
the
firmament
the
one
to
rule
the
day
and
the
other
to
rule
the
night
and
that
he
made
the
stars
also
for
it
is
nowhere
stated
that
the
greater
light
was
not
made
to
perform
a
similar
office
for
each
of
the
other
planets
of
our
system
or
that
it
was
not
set
in
the
firmament
to
adorn
the
skies
of
other
and
worlds
as
bright
arcturus
fairest
of
the
stars
adorns
our
own
nor
can
materialistic
science
dispute
the
more
explicitly
revealed
fact
that
the
order
of
creation
so
far
at
least
as
animal
and
vegetable
life
are
concerned
is
precisely
that
to
be
found
in
geological
distribution
or
as
unerringly
recorded
in
the
lithographic
pages
of
nature
and
yet
nothing
was
known
of
these
pages
not
a
leaf
had
been
turned
back
at
the
time
the
bible
genesis
was
written
so
that
whoever
was
its
author
this
precise
order
of
distribution
could
only
have
been
guessed
at
setting
aside
its
inspirational
claims
by
the
writer
of
this
most
remarkable
genesis
and
again
science
can
have
no
successful
conflict
certainly
none
in
which
she
will
ultimately
come
off
victor
in
reference
to
the
equally
explicit
statement
that
every
living
thing
and
every
living
creature
either
yields
seed
bears
fruit
or
brings
forth
issue
after
his
kind
and
distinctively
none
other
for
this
would
seem
to
be
the
one
inflexible
law
governing
all
living
organisms
from
which
there
can
be
no
divergence
in
any
such
sense
as
the
scientific
genesis
pretentiously
so
called
would
authoritatively
indicate
no
increase
in
variety
which
spencer
regards
as
the
essential
characteristic
of
all
progress
will
ever
enable
us
to
gather
grapes
from
thorns
or
figs
from
thistles
nor
will
materialistic
science
ever
succeed
in
overthrowing
the
bible
theory
herein
advanced
that
the
germs
of
all
living
things
man
only
excepted
are
in
themselves
that
is
each
after
its
kind
upon
the
earth
and
that
they
severally
make
their
appearance
whenever
the
necessary
environing
conditions
occur
this
most
remarkable
statement
of
the
bible
genesis
will
be
found
to
fit
into
all
the
vital
phenomena
occurring
upon
our
globe
explaining
the
appearance
of
infusoria
all
mycological
and
cryptogamic
forms
as
well
as
all
vegetal
and
animal
organisms
all
these
come
from
the
earth
wherein
there
is
life
and
hence
the
divine
command
for
the
earth
to
bring
forth
every
living
thing
except
man
after
his
kind
but
let
us
embrace
in
the
proper
antithetical
summary
of
statements
some
of
the
more
distinctive
points
of
antagonism
between
the
bible
genesis
and
that
of
materialistic
science
the
bible
genesis
the
bible
genesis
presents
the
theological
conception
of
a
god
or
an
infinite
intelligence
in
the
universe
with
whom
as
personified
there
is
no
variableness
neither
shadow
of
turning
the
bible
genesis
represents
every
living

as
of
its
kind
which
the
earth
was
commanded
to
bring
forth
from
seed
or
germs
declared
to
be
in
themselves
upon

the

out
of

every

that
is
pleasant
to
the
sight
and
good
for
food

therein
and
every

the

after
his
kind
enumerating
them
in
the
order
in
which
they
appear
in
geological
distribution
the

represents
god
as
making
man
in
his
own
image
after
he
had
commanded
the
waters
and
the
earth
to
bring
forth
abundantly
of
every
other
living
creature
the
bible
genesis
represents
god
as
breathing
into
man
the
breath
of
life
and
he
became
a
living
soul
the
bible
genesis
represents
god
as
creating
the

for
the

of
man
giving
him
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the

the

of

the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
of
every
living
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
face
of
the

the

genesis
represents
god
as
exercising
a
moral
government
over
man
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
living
creature
in
fine
the
bible
genesis
represents
man
as
only
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
the
scientific
genesis
the
scientific
genesis
virtually
eliminates
the
idea
of
a
god
from
the
universe
by
assigning
to
natural
causes
all
the
diversified
and
phases
and
changes
that
have
taken
place
therein
extending
through
an
infinite
duration
of
past
time
and
constantly
confronted
by
an
infinite
duration
of
time
to
come
the
scientific
genesis
represents
every
living
thing
as
more
or
less
of
its
kind
but
advancing
towards
perfection
by
some
underlying
law
of
variability
or
selection
of
the
fittest
or
by
gradual
development
from
lower
into
higher
organisms
the
scientific
genesis
emphatically
repudiates
the
idea
of
any
divine
agency
in
the
growth
of
plants
and
trees
and
insists
that
life
in
all
its
manifold
phases
is
only
an
undiscovered
correlative
of
motion
or
at
best
only
a
sort
of
between
matter
and
motion
the
scientific
genesis
represents
all
fishes
amphibia
reptiles
birds
as
travelling
along
their
respective
lines
of
developmental
progress
and
differentiation
from
points
far
back
in
geologic
time
and
constantly
working
their
way
up
from
cold
and
flabby
creatures
into
those
of
higher
cerebral
activity
and
brighter
and
more
varied
life
until
gigantic
winged
reptiles
mounted
into
the
air
and
became
birds
the
scientific
genesis
attributes
the
appearance
of
every
living
creature
upon
the
earth
to
a
law
of
evolution
by
which
one
thing
constantly
overlaps
another
forming
a
sort
of
stairway
for
lower
organisms
to
climb
into
higher
without
regard
to
kind
or
even
orders
genera
or
species
the
scientific
genesis
distinctly
takes
issue
with
that
of
the
bible
respecting
the
divine
origin
of
man
and
insists
that
he
has
been
climbing
up
from
protoplasmic
matter
through
a
thousand
other
and
lower
organisms
until
he
finally
leaped
from
an
anthropoid
ape
into
man
the
scientific
genesis
emphatically
repudiates
the
idea
of
a
soul
as
thus
derived
and
even
insists
that
conscience
the
highest
known
moral
factor
in
the
universe
is
only
a
modified
expression
of
the
social
instincts
of
the
lower
animals
the
difference
being
in
degree
only
not
in
kind
the
scientific
genesis
promptly
takes
issue
with
this
creative
plan
and
purpose
insisting
in
the
dazzling
speculations
and
fancies
of
its
adherents
that
well
known
physical
and
physiological
laws
have
worked
out
all
these
phenomenal
aspects
and
changes
and
that
these
laws
are
wholly
indifferent
as
to
whether
man
shall
have
dominion
over
the
shark
and
the
tiger
or
they
dominion
over
him
the
scientific
genesis
illogically
insists
that
natural
laws
those
expressing
no
sovereign
will
and
having
no
seat
in
the
bosom
of
god
are
fully
adequate
for
the
government
of
man
he
exercising
to
that
end
all
the
higher
powers
with
which
by
evolutional
changes
he
has
become
endowed
while
the
scientific
genesis
represents
him
as
only
a
little
higher
than
the
apes
and
yet
no
scientific
authority
has
ever
been
claimed
for
these
sacred
hebrew
writings
they
were
simply
designed
as
a
rule
of
human
faith
and
conduct
ostensibly
having
the
divine
sanction
and
containing
historical
devotional
didactic
and
prophetical
writings
to
be
read
through
at
least
once
a
year
in
the
jewish
synagogues
but
the
most
important
of
these
antithetical
statements
so
far
at
least
as
modern
scientific
research
and
inquiry
are
concerned
is
that
which
represents
the
germs
of
all
living
things
man
alone
excepted
as
being
implanted
in
the
earth
itself
we
take
the
definition
of
the
hebrew
word
translated
seed
in
the
verse
of
the
chapter
of
genesis
from
professor
edward
leigh
of
magdalen
hall
oxford
in
his
critica
sacra
first
published
in
asparsit
cum
aspersione
fudit
etc
that
is
something
sown
scattered
universally
diffused
everywhere
implanted
as
a
germ
in
the
earth
that
the
hebrew
word
does
not
mean
in
this
connection
the
seed
of
a
plant
or
tree
is
manifest
from
the
fact
that
the
first
plant
or
tree
from
which
seed
could
have
been
derived
had
not
yet
appeared
upon
the
earth
the
exact
translation
is
whose
primordial
germs
are
in
themselves
that
is
each
after
its
kind
upon
the
earth
implanted
therein
as
the
diversorum
viventium
of
william
harvey
were
originally
implanted
in
the
earth
this
illustrious
physician
and
biologist
the
discoverer
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
not
only
taught
the
doctrine
expressed
in
his
phrase
vivum
ex
but
that
of
primordial
germs
living
indestructible
principles
of
life
existing
in
the
earth
itself
for
it
is
evident
that
he
uses
the
word
egg
in
its
more
general
sense
as
designating
any
material
substance
capable
of
receiving
his
primordium
first
principle
of
life
and
developing
itself
into
a
living
organism
the
whole
controversy
as
at
present
conducted
by
the
materialists
and
vitalists
resolves
itself
into
this
one
question
whether
life
springs
from
what
harvey
calls
a
primordium
a
vital
germ
or
unit
or
whether
it
originates
as
the
materialists
assert
from
infusions
contained
in
their
experimental
flasks
or
from
plastide
particles
contained
in
protoplasmic
matter
or
from
the
still
more
daring
hypothesis
of
molecular
machinery
as
worked
by
molecular
force
it
is
certain
that
the
materialistic
theory
is
quite
as
inexplicable
on
the
basis
of
analogical
reasoning
and
microscopical
investigation
as
that
indicated
in
the
bible
genesis
while
the
vitalistic
theory
would
seem
to
be
more
in
harmony
with
vital
phenomena
and
hence
the
more
rational
hypothesis
of
the
two
besides
the
bible
genesis
answers
to
the
logical
necessity
of
predicating
a
determinate
cause
for
each
and
every
vital
effect
or
each
living
organism
apparently
springing
from
plasmic
conditions
or
mere
structureless
matter
whenever
the
seeds
of
plants
or
trees
are
actually
planted
or
sown
in
the
earth
this
logical
necessity
rests
on
an
induction
impregnably
laid
in
cause
and
effect
while
the
materialistic
dogma
ex
would
necessitate
a
like
induction
wherever
seed
is
not
sown
in
either
case
the
change
that
ensues
is
manifestly
due
to
vital
properties
whether
the
same
be
inhering
in
the
seed
or
in
necessary
environing
conditions
and
the
vital
processes
are
the
same
with
the
single
difference
as
to
actual
environment
the
germ
in
the
seed
is
capable
of
assimilating
by
and
thoroughly
specialized
processes
the
nutrient
matter
contained
in
its
environment
precisely
as
the
primordial
germ
develops
under
its
environing
conditions
from
the
moment
they
strike
their
rootlets
into
the
ground
the
processes
of
development
and
growth
are
the
same
the
only
point
however
necessary
to
make
in
this
connection
is
that
when
we
go
back
to
the
first
living
organism
of
a
species
its
primordially
developed
form
we
necessarily
reach
environing
conditions
within
which
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
with
an
exterior
environment
corresponding
to
the
testa
of
seeds
or
to
any
conceivable
notion
we
may
have
of
seeds
themselves
at
this
point
one
not
merely
theoretical
or
speculatively
possible
only
but
absolutely
fixed
and
determinable
in
our
backward
survey
of
the
vital
forces
of
nature
we
find
individual
parentage
lost
in
a
natural
matrix
or
in
the
vital
principle
implanted
as
a
primordium
in
the
earth
itself
to
this
inevitable
induction
of
harvey
we
are
all
driven
in
the
end
by
those
intuitive
processes
of
reasoning
which
are
hardly
less
conclusive
than
mathematical
induction
itself
we
may
call
these
primordia
viventium
plastide
particles
bioplasts
vital
units
or
whatsoever
we
will
the
name
is
nothing
the
working
process
is
everything
scientific
speculation
accomplishes
nothing
therefore
by
its
new
terminology
except
it
be
to
confound
the
ignorant
and
astonish
the
wise
to
call
the
homogeneous
basis
of
an
egg
blastima
and
its
germinal
point
a
blastid
is
all
well
enough
in
its
way
but
it
adds
no
new
knowledge
nor
additional
wealth
of
language
wherewith
to
predicate
vital
theories
whether
they
relate
to
the
progeny
of
a
or
the
lair
of
a
tiger
in
an
indian
jungle
teach
us
to
know
what
nature
not
what
she
and
whatever
of
divine
revelation
is
vouchsafed
us
whether
it
be
found
in
the
majestic
poem
of
the
dawn
attributed
to
the
inspired
pen
of
moses
in
the
shakespeare
or
the
irradiated
and
soul
of
a
shelley
let
us
accept
it
with
thanks
if
not
to
the
inspired
authors
themselves
at
least
to
the
great
giver
of
life
who
imparted
their
inspiration
we
accept
the
theory
of
primordial
germs
not
simply
because
it
is
contained
in
the
bible
genesis
nor
because
it
was
conceived
by
the
great
and
gifted
harvey
as
a
possible
solution
of
the
whole
difficulty
but
because
it
presents
as
we
have
before
said
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
all
the
phenomenal
facts
of
life
with
which
we
are
acquainted
if
herbert
spencer
will
descend
from
his
stilted
theory
of
molecular
machinery
worked
by
molecular
force
and
tell
us
what
it
all
means
and
at
the
same
time
turn
us
out
a
single
plastide
particle
or
fungus
spore
by
any
generating
process
referable
to
the
machinery
in
question
we
will
as
devoutly
worship
matter
and
motion
as
ever
ancient
egyptian
did
the
god
osiris
but
until
he
does
this
we
prefer
to
accept
the
positive
assurance
of
professor
lionel
beale
a
far
more
competent
authority
to
speak
of
hypothetical
molecules
that
none
of
the
forces
possessed
by
the
molecules
of
which
the
primitive
nebulosity
of
the
universe
was
composed
ever
produced
a
vital
manifestation
or
succeeded
in
making
life
a
slave
to
force
we
shall
consider
this
question
of
molecular
force
in
its
proper
place
and
with
reference
to
the
different
theories
of
life
advanced
by
the
materialists
without
pursuing
it
further
in
this
connection
the
evidence
we
shall
present
in
reference
to
the
alternations
of
forest
growths
and
the
impossibility
of
accounting
for
them
on
any
theory
of
alternations
covering
in
many
instances
independent
forests
springing
up
on
a
vast
scale
and
the
still
wider
dispersion
of
domestic
weeds
grasses
forage
plants
etc
in
localities
where
they
were
never
known
before
will
be
conclusive
we
think
of
the
correctness
of
our
position
that
the
bible
genesis
contains
true
key
to
the
mystery
of
bear
in
mind
that
the
true
theory
of
life
whenever
it
shall
be
reached
in
human
conception
and
formulated
into
processes
of
action
must
satisfactorily
explain
all
as
newton
theory
of
gravitation
accounts
for
the
movements
of
all
celestial
bodies
and
the
simpler
the
theory
when
once
formulated
the
more
perfectly
it
falls
into
the
grooves
of
thought
and
the
more
harmoniously
it
adapts
itself
to
all
vital
manifestations
the
more
conclusive
must
be
the
induction
on
which
it
rests
the
emphatic
statement
that
the
primordial
germs
of
all
living
things
are
in
the
earth
from
the
lowest
infusorial
form
to
the
highest
vital
organism
below
man
when
supplemented
by
the
scientific
statement
that
vital
units
make
their
appearance
whenever
environing
conditions
favor
is
conclusively
a
theory
which
accounts
for
all
the
heretofore
occurring
upon
our
globe
and
this
theory
falls
at
once
into
the
necessary
categories
of
human
thought
life
as
generally
defined
is
a
state
of
organized
being
wherein
there
is
functional
activity
while
a
state
or
is
an
incidence
determined
by
environing
conditions
but
back
of
each
of
these
life
and
its
there
must
lie
some
efficient
cause
producing
in
the
first
instance
the
environing
conditions
and
then
the
functional
activity
dependent
on
organization
to
assume
that
this
efficient
cause
is
simply
the
effect
or
result
of
organization
one
of
its
dependent
conditions
is
begging
the
whole
question
and
at
the
same
time
discarding
a
very
important
element
in
the
problem
that
of
conditional
environment
what
this
efficient
cause
is
a
question
that
awakens
no
responsive
inquiry
it
strikes
its
roots
too
deeply
into
the
intuitions
of
consciousness
for
the
soul
to
give
back
an
intelligible
reply
certain
it
is
that
neither
metaphysical
speculation
nor
scientific
inquiry
will
ever
enable
us
to
reach
the
roots
of
this
question
or
extract
from
them
the
first
quantitive
essence
of
life
itself
we
shall
also
consider
in
their
proper
place
the
various
theories
of
life
which
have
been
advanced
from
time
to
time
by
the
materialists
in
their
avowed
hostility
to
current
religious
beliefs
and
especially
those
founded
on
the
sacred
hebrew
writings
and
the
supplementary
teachings
of
the
new
testament
and
to
show
the
extent
of
this
hostility
and
the
real
of
those
waging
it
it
is
only
necessary
to
refer
to
the
great
central
doctrine
of
the
sacred
scriptures
that
life
natural
spiritual
eternal
is
the
gift
of
god
and
this
is
the
grand
of
all
religious
edifices
those
erected
by
the
egyptians
the
assyrians
the
phoenicians
the
greeks
and
even
the
inhabitants
of
farther
india
materialistic
science
must
therefore
deal
its
first
and
most
effective
blows
at
life
either
as
a
theory
to
be
resolutely
assailed
and
overthrown
or
else
thoroughly
ignored
and
set
aside
in
the
more
imposing
and
august
temple
of
science
hence
the
reader
will
find
in
none
of
the
great
encyclopedias
prepared
under
the
supervision
of
scientific
men
the
slightest
mention
whatever
of
life
as
a
subject
worthy
of
consideration
at
their
hands
it
finds
of
course
its
meagre
definitional
place
in
the
dictionaries
but
the
bulky
and
more
exhaustive
encyclopedias
have
no
room
for
it
except
as
it
may
be
defined
under
some
correlate
of
motion
as
the
latent
possibility
of
a
nebula
or
of
undifferentiated
primeval
mist
originally
pervading
the
interplanetary
spaces
we
have
no
disposition
to
charge
such
materialists
as
professors
tyndall
bastian
haeckel
virchow
and
herbert
spencer
with
directing
their
experimental
batteries
against
the
phenomenal
facts
of
life
for
the
purpose
of
overthrowing
the
foundations
of
religious
faith
and
belief
in
the
world
they
are
all
eminent
scientists
and
apparently
earnest
seekers
after
truth
in
the
several
directions
in
which
their
respective
paths
of
investigation
have
been
pursued
but
they
manifestly
array
their
opinions
against
the
vitalists
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
no
scientific
value
whatever
in
the
many
and
singularly
diversified
statements
respecting
life
in
both
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
this
it
may
be
claimed
is
necessitated
by
the
generally
accepted
dogma
that
science
and
religion
are
more
or
less
hostile
the
former
resting
on
the
inexorable
logic
of
facts
only
and
the
latter
entirely
on
and
notions
respecting
faith
and
belief
to
this
position
of
theirs
we
have
no
objection
to
make
so
long
as
they
subject
their
scientific
statements
to
the
one
rigid
ordeal
of
positively
ascertained
facts
but
when
they
set
themselves
to
spinning
their
theories
of
life
on
the
strength
of
nebular
potentialities
and
the
possibilities
of
undifferentiated
sky
mist
we
must
insist
that
they
are
infinitely
wider
of
the
mark
than
the
theologians
who
claim
that
the
great
formative
power
of
the
universe
is
god
and
that
his
spirit
and
not
gravitation
upholds
the
order
of
the
heavens
certainly
much
wider
of
the
mark
than
was
pope
when
he
wrote
of
the
universe
all
are
but
parts
of
one
stupendous
whole
whose
body
nature
is
and
god
the
soul
the
truth
is
that
religion
is
quite
as
much
the
handmaid
of
science
as
science
can
be
said
to
be
the
handmaid
of
religion
she
breathes
far
more
household
laws
for
her
devotees
if
she
does
not
veil
her
sacred
fires
more
modestly
from
the
sight
of
men
she
is
certainly
less
dogmatic
less
dictatorial
less
abounding
in
positive
assertion
than
what
now
passes
for
science
in
the
popular
estimation
perhaps
herbert
spencer
represents
the
scientific
side
of
a
greater
number
of
questions
agitating
the
public
mind
than
any
other
one
man
and
he
is
still
industriously
engaged
in
solving
or
endeavoring
to
solve
a
greater
number
of
social
problems
and
yet
the
most
enthusiastic
admirer
of
this
gentleman
will
be
forced
to
admit
when
driven
to
the
wall
of
actual
controversy
that
if
not
of
his
more
formidable
statements
put
forth
in
the
name
of
science
remain
undemonstrated
as
scientific
truths
we
are
thankful
enough
however
for
the
he
has
vouchsafed
us
to
let
the
other
pass
as
the
dogmatic
achievements
of
his
wonderfully
gifted
pen
professor
beale
asks
the
question
whether
a
man
who
has
the
gift
of
science
must
ever
be
wanting
in
the
gift
of
faith
it
is
certain
that
this
inquiry
sharply
emphasizes
the
antagonism
at
present
existing
between
materialistic
science
and
religious
faith
but
there
is
only
one
reason
why
this
antagonism
should
be
continued
and
that
is
the
persistent
claim
of
science
to
superior
recognition
in
all
cases
where
there
is
the
slightest
apparent
conflict
between
the
two
certainly
no
man
ever
did
more
to
popularize
the
genuine
truths
of
science
in
this
country
than
professor
agassiz
or
worked
more
successfully
to
that
end
he
was
willing
to
place
the
decorative
wreath
on
the
starry
forehead
of
science
but
refused
to
pluck
from
the
soul
the
starry
eyes
of
faith
and
hope
that
man
might
be
dwarfed
down
to
the
nearest
of
kin
to
the
anthropoid
ape
when
we
come
to
this
assumed
relationship
in
genetic
types
we
have
not
so
much
as
laid
the
first
abutment
of
the
bridge
by
which
these
revivers
of
lucretian
materialism
would
span
the
chasm
between
mind
and
matter
between
the
spiritual
and
physical
side
of
man
between
dark
brute
sense
and
a
soul
as
white
as
heaven
for
going
back
to
undifferentiated
primeval
mist
and
following
down
the
whole
line
of
vital
phenomena
from
whatever
subtle
molecular
combinations
their
first
manifestation
may
have
arisen
until
we
reach
the
highest
differentiated
organism
below
man
we
shall
find
the
chasm
between
the
physical
and
the
psychical
not
a
thousandth
part
spanned
and
even
if
man
with
the
assistance
of
all
the
maleficent
spirits
that
walk
the
air
both
when
we
wake
and
sleep
could
span
this
chasm
it
would
be
only
by
another
bridge
of
mirza
across
which
no
daring
mortal
could
ever
pass
herbert
spencer
in
his
principles
thinks
he
has
mastered
the
necessary
psychological
if
not
mechanical
engineering
for
the
successful
construction
of
this
bridge
in
that
branch
of
his
work
entitled
the
principles
of
psychology
he
so
far
abandons
the
exact
scientific
method
as
to
take
up
psychical
phenomena
and
deal
with
them
genetically
as
he
would
with
the
phenomenal
manifestations
of
organic
life
in
the
continuous
chain
of
ideas
every
where
presented
as
consecutive
thoughts
in
the
universe
he
finds
or
claims
to
find
in
these
psychical
manifestations
a
constant
tendency
towards
differentiation
towards
advanced
and
continuously
advancing
differences
varieties
and
new
modes
of
thought
the
same
as
or
similar
to
those
taking
place
in
living
organisms
he
accordingly
assumes
for
the
science
of
mind
as
complete
a
foundation
on
which
to
base
the
doctrine
of
evolution
as
in
the
case
of
either
physical
or
physiological
science
but
he
is
no
less
troubled
in
this
psychological
realm
with
divergent
varieties
and
exceptional
variations
and
changes
than
when
he
plants
himself
on
the
more
solid
substratum
of
life
in
the
abounding
realm
of
nature
his
psychological
differentiations
present
too
many
and
divergencies
and
exceptional
branchings
in
one
direction
and
still
more
exceptional
in
another
to
admit
of
any
sufficiently
potentiated

to

life
its
true
genesis
the
profound
newton
did
not
attempt
to
show
what
the
gravitative
force
of
the
universe
was
he
bore
himself
more
modestly
only
endeavoring
to
show
that
such
a
force
existed
and
that
it
accounted
for
all
the
movements
of
celestial
bodies
even
to
their
slightest
perturbations
he
frankly
admitted
his
inability
to
determine
what
this
force
was
but
by
observations
and
calculations
made
with
the
greatest
care
he
ascertained
that
its
action
upon
matter
was
proportional
to
its
mass
directly
and
to
the
square
of
its
distance
inversely
and
with
the
requisite
data
and
the
principles
of
pure

he
demonstrated
that
this
mysterious
force
utterly
inapproachable
by
human
conception
in

mystery
not

governs
and
controls
the
movements
of
all

rolling
in

but
transmits
its
influence
not
successively
but
instantly
and
without
diminution
to
the
smallest
conceivable
molecule
on
the
outlying
boundaries
of
the
universe
in
the
same
calm
and
comprehensive
spirit
if
it
be
possible
for
us
to
reach
it
let
us
look
upon
this
mysterious
force
called
life
not
to
show
that
it
is
simply
a
correlate
of
this
or
that
motion
a
thing
utterly
impossible
of
demonstration
if
it
actually
exists
but
to
ascertain
how
and
in
what
way
it
acts
and
by
what
known
law
if
any
it
is
governed
in
all
the
vast
realm
of
reality
there
is
no
more
conclusive
and
palpable
fact
than
that
life
exists
appearing
wherever
the
bright
light
flashes
the
loving
raindrop
falls
the
dancing
brook
ripples
the
sparkling
streamlet
murmurs
and
the
broad
river
flows
to
mingle
with
the
sea
all
along
this
bright
pathway
of
sunlight
and
cool
translucent
wave
this
wonderful
principle
of
vitality
manifests
itself
in
life
filling
the
air
with
balmy
odors
making
perennial
bud
leaf
and
flower
speeding
from
sire
to
son
from
heart
to
heart
from
spirit
to
spirit
from
age
to
age
from
time
into
eternity
for
like
all
living
principles
in
this
realm
of
reality
it
can
not
die
it
is
immortal
in
its
primal
source
immortal
all
along
its
bright
pathway
immortal
as
it
flows
onward
to
eternity
immortal
in
its
return
to
the
bosom
of
god
it
is
no
postulate
no
corollary
no
mere
hypothetical
judgment
no
undiscovered
correlative
of
motion
no
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
but
the
one
grand
comprehensive
on
which
all
the
objective
as
well
as
subjective
data
of
the
universe
rest
it
is
the
same
spirit
that
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
depths
in
that
majestic
dawn
of
creation
when
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
first
day
the
same
spirit
that
upholds
the
order
of
the
heavens
that
pervades
the
vast
realm
of
reality
that
flashes
in
the
bright
sunlight
descends
in
the
loving
raindrop
ripples
in
the
dancing
brook
sparkles
in
the
murmuring
stream
and
forever
flows
onward
bearing
its
primal
fulness
to
the
sea
to
deny
the
existence
of
this
vital
principle
because
we
can
not
bottle
it
up
in
our
airless
flasks
to
reduce
it
to
some
unknown
correlate
of
motion
because
it
constantly
defies
our
poor
mental
grasp
to
insist
upon
its
artificial
production
because
elementary
substances
may
be
chemically
handled
in
our
laboratories
is
the
same
sort
of
preposterous
folly
that
newton
would
have
been
guilty
of
had
he
attempted
to
show
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
gravity
in
the
universe
that
it
was
only
some
undiscovered
correlative
of
a
thermal
limit
some
unknown
molecular
complexity
or
entanglement
in
cosmic
ether
some
spontaneously
occurring
affinity
or
antagonism
of
ethereal
molecules
in
the
interplanetary
spaces
some
potentiated
potentiality
of
mere
conditions
of
which
he
could
have
had
no
experimental
knowledge
nor
have
given
the
slightest
analogical
proof
that
we
are
justified
in
thus
partially
travestying
the
technical
methods
of
some
of
our
modern
scientists
so
called
especially
those
of
the
materialistic
school
those
advocating
a
purely
physical
theory
of
life
we
need
only
quote
a
sentence
or
two
from
professor
lionel
beale
of
king
college
london
this
eminent
physiologist
in
his
recent
work
on
the
mystery
of
life
says
notwithstanding
all
that
has
been
asserted
to
the
contrary
not
one
vital
action
has
yet
been
accounted
for
by
physics
and
chemistry
the
assertion
that
life
is
correlated
force
rests
upon
assertion
alone
and
we
are
just
as
far
from
an
explanation
of
vital
phenomena
by
as
we
were
before
the
discovery
of
the
doctrine
of
the
correlation
of
forces
and
he
further
adds
that
each
additional
year
labor
in
this
special
field
of
investigation
only
confirms
him
more
strongly
than
ever
in
the
opinion
that
the
physical
doctrine
of
life
can
not
be
sustained
many
able
and
eminently
learned
physiologists
have
been
disposed
to
recognize
the
presence
of
germs
in
the
earth
but
not
to
the
extent
of
accounting
for
all
therein
as
the
doctrine
is
conclusively
taught
in
the
bible
genesis
the
language
of
this
genesis
is
too
clear
and
explicit
to
be
misunderstood
in
its
proper
renderings
it
especially
emphasizes
the
remarkable
and
most
extraordinary
statement
at
least
for
the
period
in
which
it
was
written
that
all
life
comes
primordially
from
the
waters
and
the
earth
note
the
order
in
which
the
command
to
bring
forth
was
issued
let
the
earth
bring
forth
its
vegetation
let
the
waters
bring
forth
the
fishes
the
amphibia
the
reptiles
fowl
of
the
let
the
earth
bring
forth
the
beast
the
cattle
every
living
creature
and
everything
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
each
after
his
kind
us
make
man
in
our
own
and
this
is
the
precise
order
in
which
the
scientific
genesis
proceeds
with
all
the
lithographic
pages
of
nature
turned
back
for
its
inspection
before
vegetation
there
could
have
been
no
animal
life
upon
the
globe
this
fact
is
most
conclusively
proved
not
only
by
geographic
and
paleontologic
records
but
by
legitimate
induction
from
the
highly
crystalline
and
for
the
most
part
era
far
back
in
the
laurentian
period
down
in
the
order
of
time
to
the
modern
or
period
there
is
one
continuous
history
of
written
upon
the
stratified
rocks
in
the
order
of
the
bible
genesis
was
this
mere
guess
and
fancy
on
the
part
of
the
writer
even
to
the
seemingly
improbable
element
wherein
is
assigned
the
origin
of
the
fowl
of
the
air
bear
in
mind
that
nothing
was
known
of
geological
distribution
at
the
time
this
most
remarkable
genesis
was
written
had
there
been
it
is
certain
that
the
careful
and
painstaking
hesiod
who
suffered
no
important
fact
of
the
to
escape
him
would
have
given
us
some
hint
of
it
in
his
works
and
days
for
greece
was
even
in
his
early
day
largely
the
recipient
of
phoenician
learning
and
literature
as
she
was
certainly
phoenicia
in
letters
but
the
more
conclusive
proofs
of
the
correctness
of
the
order
of
creation
as
given
in
the
bible
genesis
are
to
be
found
in
the
accurate
observations
of
modern
geological
science
before
there
could
have
appeared
in
the
primeval
oceans
any
living
organism
even
the
lowest
primordial
forms
of
crustacea
there
must
have
been
marine
vegetation
that
springing
from
inorganic
matter
and
laying
the
foundation
of
organic
life
plants
originate
in
and
are
solely
nourished
by
inorganic
substances
or
to
speak
more
definitely
they
originate
from
primordial
germs
the
first
elementary
principles
of
life
whenever
inorganic
conditions
favor
and
assimilating
air
water
and
other
inorganic
materials
convert
them
into
organic
substances
or
such
as
answer
to
the
conditions
of
organic
life
in
doing
this
they
take
up
and
decompose
carbonic
acid
retain
the
carbon
and
give
off
oxygen
a
vital
process
not
known
to
occur
in
the
case
of
animal
life
that
their
primordial
germs
or
vital
units
are
in
the
earth
as
the
bible
genesis
declares
is
conclusively
shown
by
the
experimental
processes
first
successfully
entered
upon
by
the
abbé
spallanzani
charles
bonnet
and
others
and
more
recently
renewed
and
advocated
by
pasteur
and
his
in
flask
experimentation
as
well
as
logically
established
by
inductive
methods
ex
is
conceded
to
be
as
conclusive
an
induction
as
vivum
ex
that
is
as
without
some
chemical
unit
some
primary
least
considered
as
a
whole
there
can
be
no
chemical
action
so
without
some
vital
unit
in
the
same
primary
sense
there
can
be
no
vital
manifestation
the
doctrine
of
chemical
units
is
universally
conceded
and
that
of
morphological
units
almost
as
universally
claimed
what
greater
incongruity
is
there
then
in
assuming
the
presence
between
the
two
of
a
physiological
or
vital
unit
at
all
events
it
is
as
impossible
to
demonstrate
the
of
the
one
unit
as
the
other
and
so
long
as
legitimate
induction
supports
the
doctrine
of
the
bible
genesis
it
is
useless
to
indulge
in
a
contrary
assumption
which
is
wholly
without
verification
or
proof
but
to
return
to
land
vegetation
this
appeared
and
flourished
throughout
the
devonian
period
if
not
anterior
to
it
and
long
before
the
appearance
of
batrachian
reptiles
and
other
low
forms
of
life
in
fact
there
could
have
been
no
atmosphere
until
the
earlier
land
vegetation
had
whipped
out
its
more
destructive
elements
and
paved
the
way
in
necessary
conditions
for
the
appearance
of
animals
hence
the
command
for
the
earth
to
bring
forth
both
marine
and
land
vegetation
the
vegetation
of
the
earth
before
there
was
any
similar
command
respecting
either
marine
or
land
forms
of
organic
life
but
by
what
logical
method
was
this
exact
order
inferred
in
the
bible
genesis
neither
the
jews
nor
their
earlier
hebrew
ancestors
nor
the
phoenicians
before
or
after
them
were
in
any
sense
of
the
word
metaphysicians
nor
did
their
language
admit
of
those
nicer
distinctions
and
speculative
conclusions
which
would
have
enabled
any
writer
using
it
thousands
of
years
ago
to
draw
the
commanding
induction
contained
in
this
remarkable
genesis
there
is
nothing
in
the
incomparable
methods
of
comte
or
the
metaphysical
spirit
of
herbert
spencer
in
his
most
daring
speculations
which
gives
the
world
a
more
legitimate
and
conclusive
induction
than
is
contained
in
this
simple
statement
of
the
order
of
creation
that
it
should
have
been
a
mere
piece
of
on
the
part
of
moses
or
any
other
writer
of
his
time
covering
as
it
does
so
many
particularities
of
statement
all
according
with
the
exact
observations
of
geologic
science
and
supported
by
paleontologic
records
requires
quite
as
much
credulity
of
judgment
as
to
accept
it
for
divinely
inspired
truth
a
disciple
of
comte
might
object
to
this
conclusion
as
susceptible
of
two
interpretations
the
one
a
legitimate
induction
and
the
other
not
but
the
mind
of
the
profounder
reasoner
would
accept
the
interpretation
which
is
supported
by
the
higher
reason
and
validated
by
the
greater
number
of
facts
in
the
case
of
a
strongly
intuitive
mind
it
might
be
possible
to
guess
the
exact
order
of
three
or
four
apparently
disconnected
events
but
to
arbitrarily
associate
with
them
other
and
more
distinctively
subordinate
occurrences
like
the
appearance
or
disappearance
of
whole
groups
and
classes
of
plants
and
animals
the
supposition
that
and
not
positive
information
governed
in
the
formation
of
a
judgment
is
at
once
rejected
because
of
its
utter
incredibility
it
is
not
our
purpose
however
either
to
affirm
or
the
inspirational
claims
of
the
bible
genesis
we
simply
take
its
language
as
we
find
it
stript
of
its
masoretic
renderings
and
irrational
interpretations
and
unhesitatingly
aver
that
the
three
hebrew
words
translated
in
our
common
version
whose
seed
is
in
itself
upon
the
earth
contains
when
properly
rendered
the
key
that
unlocks
the
whole
mystery
of
life
or
as
gull
emphasizes
it
the
grand
of
the
day
it
expressly
declares
that
the
primordial
germs
of
all
and
inferentially
of
all
life
are
in
themselves
each
after
its
kind
upon
the
earth
and
we
have
only
to
supplement
this
physiological
statement
with
the
necessary
incidence
of
conditions
as
formulated
by
the
physicists
to
explain
every
phenomenal
fact
of
life
hitherto
occurring
upon
our
globe
take
all
the
hints
as
to
the
spontaneous
origin
of
life
to
be
met
with
in
aristotle
all
those
subsequently
repeated
by
lucretius
and
ovid
all
the
experiments
of
the
renowned
abbé
spallanzani
all
the
alleged
fantastic
assumptions
of
bonnet
all
the
theories
of
panspermism
by
whomsoever
advocated
all
the
fortuitous
aggregations
of
organiques
as
put
forth
by
the
french
school
of
materialists
all
the
of
the
gifted
harvey
all
the
molecular
machinery
and
undiscovered
correlates
of
motion
formulated
by
herbert
spencer
and
professor
bastian
in
fine
all
the
more
brilliant
theories
of
life
ever
spun
from
the
recesses
of
the
human
brain
and
we
shall
find
that
they
all
fit
into
the
three
simple
hebrew
words
to
be
found
in
the
bible
genesis
all
are
explained
by
we
say
with
one
exception
only
that
of
man
and
how
inconceivably
grand
and
majestic
this
exception
the
crowning
work
of
creation
was
man
he
came
from
no
muddy
vesture
of
decay
no
mere
fiat
spoke
him
into
existence
he
who
was
to
have
dominion
over
all
the
earth
who
was
to
be
created
only
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
and
breathing
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
became
a
living
here
is
the
bridge
over
which
the
evolutionist
may
pass
if
he
will
without
wearing
either
the
dunce
cap
or
the
ass
ears
it
spans
the
chasm
between
the
anthropoid
ape
and
man
as
no
other
bridge
can
span
it
across
this
bridge
is
flung
the
living
garment
of
god
and
how
grandly
yet
reverently
and
humbly
did
the
profound
newton
cross
it
oh
ye
defiant
iconoclasts
of
sublime
faith
in
the
old
doctrines
ye
who
talk
so
flippantly
of
the
potentialities
of
life
in
a
nebula
who
sit
on
the
matterhorn
at
high
noon
and
muse
in
sadness
over
the
primordial
formless
fog
teeming
with
all
the
mighty
possibilities
of
myriads
of
like
our
own
and
musing
sneer
if
you
can
at
the
idea
of
a
specific
creation
in
the
beginning
of
an
infinite
intelligence
that
directs
and
superintends
all
because
can
not
annihilate
matter
nor
conceive
of
its
annihilation
in
the
infinitessimal
compass
of
brain
is
that
any
reason
why
infinite
power
and
intelligence
may
not
have
spoken
it
into
existence
at
sovereign
and
commanding
will
if
man
would
presumptuously
press
towards
the
threshold
of
the
infinite
let
him
do
it
reverently
and
with
humility
of
spirit
and
not
as
one
that
vaunteth
himself
of
strength
or
multiplieth
words
without
knowledge
but
let
us
examine
the
bible
genesis
a
little
further
in
this
direction
it
is
said
in
the
second
verse
of
the
first
chapter
that
the
spirit
of
god
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
that
is
upon
the
face
of
the
abyss
the
chaotic
mass
at
creation
the
earth
without
form
and
void
what
is
here
meant
by
the
spirit
of
god
is
that
breath
or
power
of
god
which
operates
continuously
operates
impart
life
to
inanimate
from
the
connection
in
which
it
here
stands
it
means
this
as
in
other
connections
it
means
the
power
which
operates
continuously
operates
to
produce
whatever
is
noble
and
good
in
man
there
is
no
implication
in
the
text
that
this
principle
or
power
was
suspended
in
the
act
of
creation
on
the
contrary
there
is
abundant
evidence
in
nature
to
show
that
it
is
just
as
operative
now
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
one
of
the
definitions
given
by
professor
gibbs
of
this
spirit
is
that
which
operates
throughout
inanimate
nature
not
that
which
once
operated
and
then
forever
ceased
its
operations
and
professor
gibbs
no
doubt
meant
by
nature
in
this
connection
not
only
all
the
physical
phenomena
she
presents
but
the
aggregate
or
sum
total
of
all
her
phenomena
whether
active
or
passive
animate
or
inanimate
embracing
the
world
of
matter
or
the
world
of
mind
all
are
but
parts
of
one
stupendous
whole
not
a
part
nature
and
a
part
not
nature
again
in
the
eleventh
verse
it
is
distinctly
declared
that
the
the
germinal
principle
of
life
is
in
the
earth
producing
each
living
thing
at
least
in
the
vegetable
world
after
its
kind
that
is
after
its
own
class
order
genera
species
hence
the
three
distinct
and
separate
commands
given
to
the
earth
or
to
the
earth
and
its
waters
to
bring
forth
no
such
command
would
have
been
given
to
the
earth
had
it
not
first
received
its
of
from
god
in
other
words
derived
the
animating
principle
of
life
from
the
source
of
all
life
and
hence
also
the
two
separate
averments
in
the
second
chapter
of
genesis
both
entirely
meaningless
apart
from
the
construction
we
here
give
it
that
out
of
the
ground
made
the
lord
god
to
grow
the
vegetation
of
the
earth
and
out
of
the
ground
produced
he
or
caused
to
be
produced
every
beast
of
the
field
all
of
which
has
a
definite
and
comprehensive
significance
in
this
one
sense
only
that
the
animating
principle
of
life
is
in
the
earth
as
the
language
of
this
most
remarkable
genesis
implies
and
this
seems
to
have
been
the
patristic
idea
namely
that
law
and
regularity
not
arbitrary
intervention
nor
any
specific
act
of
creation
were
what
governed
in
the
case
of
both
vegetal
and
animal
life
augustine
says
in
prima
institutione
naturæ
non
quseritur
miraculum
sed
quid
natura
rerum
habeat
and
it
is
certain
that
both
thomas
aquinas
and
st
basil
held
the
same
view
and
they
further
held
that
the
animating
principle
of
life
once
implanted
in
nature
held
good
for
all
time
but
we
are
not
seeking
for
early
and
mediæval
authority
what
we
propose
to
show
is
that
nature
is
still
implicitly
obeying
just
such
a
law
as
that
implied
in
the
command
given
her
to
bring
forth
however
doubtful
may
be
the
authority
on
which
it
rests
in
the
opinion
of
our
modern
scientists
and
how
completely
does
this
genesis
of
life
take
man
out
of
the
definitional
formula
embracing
the
beasts
of
the
earth
from
the
lowest
vertebrate
in
darwin
plexus
to
the
highest
quadrumane
his
nearest
allied
type
to
man
covering
almost
an
infinite
variety
of
distinct
living
forms
the
distance
to
be
traversed
in
order
to
reach
man
is
hardly
more
than
the
length
of
the
still
unlinked
and
uncompleted
chain
in
the
average
capacity
of
the
monkey
to
say
nothing
of
his
other
characteristic
differences
the
distance
is
not
half
traversed
as
a
beast
of
the
earth
he
remains
allied
to
his
own
type
and
nothing
higher
both
darwin
vertebral
and
herbert
spencer
line
of
individuation
must
begin
with
the
lancelet
and
its
disputed
head
and
end
in
the
catarrhine
or
old
world
monkey
no
induction
will
ever
extend
this
line
to
man
the
developmental
chain
if
indeed
there
be
one
has
no
congenital
link
that
will
either
drag
man
down
to
the
beast
of
the
earth
or
lift
the
latter
up
to
the
transcendent
plane
of
humanity
each
must
remain
specifically
in
his
own
type
whatever
may
be
their
vertical
tendencies
upwards
or
downwards
and
this
word
type
implies
a
fundamental
an
archetype
an
original
conception
of
what
each
should
unconditionally
be
and
what
plane
each
should
as
unconditionally
occupy
man
place
in
nature
can
never
be
changed
or
modified
by
materialistic
speculations
whatever
theories
the
materialists
may
spin
into
the
unsubstantial
warp
and
woof
of
their
scientific
formulæ
respecting
life
will
never
stand
before
the
tenacious
and
stubborn
physiological
facts
which
almost
any
and
scholar
of
nature
may
readily
present
against
them
even
the
wild
indian
of
our
prairies
has
a
more
rational
conception
of
life
and
its
accountabilities
than
some
of
these
learned
professors
whose
theoretical
conclusions
we
find
it
imperative
to
handle
with
all
his
rude
rough
nature
hanging
like
so
many
mental
clogs
about
him
this
unlettered
savage
recognizes
the
fact
that
the
earth
is
the
omnium
or
the
living
on
whose
bosom
he
shall
rest
when
his
spirit
has
passed
to
the
happy
beyond
unlettered
as
he
is
and
unread
in
any
genesis
of
life
he
fails
not
to
perceive
that
the
earth
is
forever
teeming
with
the
germinal
principles
of
life
and
that
when
his
prairie
fires
have
invaded
the
forests
in
which
he
had
previously
hunted
the
deer
other
and
different
forest
growths
are
constantly
making
their
appearance
without
any
apparent
intervention
of
seeds
but
not
without
the
supervisional
care
and
direction
of
the
great
spirit
while
many
of
his
hardier
prairie
grasses
have
disappeared
only
to
give
place
to
the
more
nutritious
coveted
by
his
favorite
game
and
here
we
may
as
well
anticipate
an
objection
which
will
be
raised
against
the
presence
of
this
animating
principle
of
life
in
the
earth
as
to
meet
and
answer
it
further
on
in
the
argument
but
as
the
objection
to
which
we
refer
is
one
of
those
dragon
teeth
we
do
not
care
to
leave
behind
us
we
will
meet
it
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
controversy
it
will
probably
be
admitted
that
the
vegetation
of
the
earth
may
appear
in
the
way
and
manner
indicated
in
the
biblical
genesis
the
same
as
infusorial
forms
appear
in
and
flasks
but
how
about
the
preëxisting
germs
or
vital
units
of
the
mastodon
the
megatherium
and
other
gigantic
mammiferous
quadrupeds
of
the
eocene
period
from
what
experimental
flasks
in
the
great
laboratory
of
nature
did
they
first
make
their
appearance
the
objection
is
a
legitimate
one
and
we
will
answer
it
but
first
let
us
do
so
from
the
materialist
own
time
they
all
agree
is
practically
infinite
past
time
as
well
as
future
while
matter
is
susceptible
of
an
infinite
number
of
diverse
movements
changes
modifications
combinations
chemically
as
well
as
molecularly
considered
this
they
claim
is
not
a
mere
hypothetical
judgment
but
a
mathematically
demonstrable
proposition
grant
it
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
and
then
see
if
the
mastodon
does
not
promptly
emerge
from
some
one
of
their
experimental
flasks
as
they
choose
to
put
it
for
if
the
number
of
these
diverse
movements
changes
modifications
of
matter
have
been
infinite
in
its
progress
from
the
lowest
statical
to
the
highest
dynamical
manifestation
then
every
possible
as
well
as
conceivable
form
of
matter
must
have
existed
somewhere
and
at
some
time
in
nature
even
to
its
highest
and
most
potentially
endowed
plasmic
form
in
which
there
is
life
and
if
this
be
true
and
the
materialists
will
not
deny
but
rather
affirm
it
then
the
conditions
of
matter
in
the
case
of
all
animals
the
mastodon
included
as
well
as
the
conditions
in
the
case
of
all
must
have
existed
with
their
necessary
environments
somewhere
and
at
some
time
in
the
laboratory
of
nature
hence
in
the
infinite
number
of
these
changes
and
combinations
in
the
countless
collocations
of
molecules
and
chemically
changed
conditions
of
matter
we
have
the
possibilities
of
all
terrestrial
as
we
have
in
the
infinite
number
of
cosmical
changes
the
possibilities
of
all
planetary
cometary
and
asteroidal
manifestations
for
whenever
these
vital
changes
occur
the
dependent
thereon
must
as
inevitably
follow
as
that
infinitely
diffused
matter
should
be
aggregated
by
gravity
or
by
what
humboldt
calls
in
his
cosmos
the
intelligence
of
the
universe
who
shall
say
then
that
in
that
immensely
remote
and
era
the
eocene
period
in
which
the
gigantic
elephantoids
first
made
their
appearance
there
did
not
exist
somewhere
in
some
one
of
more
cunning
and
prolific
recesses
the
exact
plasmic
conditions
necessary
for
the
appearance
of
the
mastodon
if
they
existed
anywhere
which
is
concessively
possible
with
the
necessary
environment
also
concessively
possible
then
the
mastodon
could
no
more
help
wallowing
out
of
his
essential
plasma
than
the
earth
can
help
responding
to
its
axial
motion
all
things
are
framed
in
the
prodigality
of
nature
and
she
never
commits
an
abortion
upon
herself
if
both
the
conditions
and
necessary
environment
were
at
any
time
present
as
they
must
have
been
on
the
materialistic
theory
the
mastodon
is
just
as
easily
accounted
for
as
the
first
fungus
or
the
first
all
physicists
as
well
as
physiologists
agree
that
individual
species
of
both
plants
and
animals
have
from
the
earth
for
the
want
of
the
necessary
conditions
under
which
they
once
lived
and
flourished
what
greater
fallacy
is
there
then
in
the
assumption
that
they
originally
from
the
presence
of
these
identical
conditions
whatever
they
may
have
been
and
whenever
they
may
have
occurred
we
put
this
question
not
simply
because
the
bible
genesis
asserts
that
of
the
made
the
lord
god
to
grow
every
plant
of
the
field
before
it
was
in
the
earth
as
well
as
every
herb
of
the
field
before
it
grew
nor
because
it
declares
that
their
primordial
germs
are
in
the
earth
nor
because
it
speaks
of
the
earth
as
containing
within
itself
the
animating
principle
of
life
but
we
put
it
on
the
irrefragable
logic
of
the
materialist
own
premises
and
conclusions
they
may
use
other
and
different
physiological
terms
from
what
we
should
care
to
employ
but
their
correlates
of
motion
their
molecular
force
their
highly
differentiated
may
possibly
mean
nothing
more
than
what
we
mean
by
vital
units
vital
forces
vital
conditions
etc
their
preference
for
the
terms
they
employ
over
essential
qualities
or
properties
of
matter
is
entirely
due
to
the
obvious
invalidity
of
their
conclusions
except
as
their
physical
theory
of
life
may
help
them
out
of
an
unpleasant
dilemma
force
is
a
more
convenient
term
on
which
to
allege
the
origin
of
life
its
spontaneous
manifestation
in
their
experimental
flasks
than
any
vital
principle
primarily
inhering
in
matter
and
manifesting
itself
whenever
conditions
favor
it
is
to
validate
their
own
reasoning
that
they
construct
their
fallacious
from
which
to
draw
their
materialistic
inductions
in
other
words
theirs
is
the
fallacy
of
causa
pro
causa
or
that
vicious
process
of
reasoning
which
alleges
some
other
than
the
real
cause
of
vital
manifestation
and
fastens
induction
where
none
is
legitimately
inferable
burdach
buffon
pouchet
needham
and
other
professed
vitalists
agree
that
in
all
there
must
be
some
preëxisting
vital
force
or
principle
without
which
no
living
thing
whether
plant
or
animal
can
come
into
existence
pouchet
says
i
have
always
thought
that
organized
beings
were
animated
by
forces
which
are
in
no
way
reducible
to
physical
or
chemical
forces
the
abbé
needham
is
satisfied
to
formulate
a
force
végetative
so
far
as
is
concerned
buffon
invariably
falls
back
on
vital
force
or
energy
and
burdach
on
a
force
plastique
which
is
essentially
inseparable
from
nature
in
her
vital
manifestations
according
to
the
latter
the
whole
universe
is
an
constantly
endowed
with
life
and
giving
expression
to
it
in
all
conceivable
directions
and
all
that
these
vitalists
need
to
give
a
full
interpretation
to
their
facts
of
observation
is
to
supplement
their
theories
with
the
bible
declaration
that
the
animating
principle
of
life
is
in
the
earth
from
which
all
living
things
make
their
appearance
each
distinctively
after
its
own
kind
whenever
environing
conditions
favor
for
they
severally
recognize
these
necessary
conditions
as
inseparable
from
all
vital
manifestation
an
effort
has
been
made
to
show
that
goethe
was
the
great
inspired
prophet
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
as
a
ceaselessly
progressive
transformation
of
one
thing
into
another
in
the
metamorphoses
of
plants
and
animals
and
haeckel
quotes
this
passage
from
him
as
entirely
conclusive
of
this
point
thus
much
we
should
have
gained
towards
solving
the
problem
of
life
that
all
the
more
perfect
organic
beings
among
which
we
include
fishes
amphibians
birds
mammals
and
at
the
head
of
the
latter
man
to
be
formed
according
to
an
archetype
which
merely
fluctuates
more
or
less
in
its
ever
persistent
parts
and
moreover
day
by
day
completes
and
transforms
itself
by
means
of
reproduction
but
this
attempt
to
give
a
poetic
glorification
to
haeckelism
in
speculations
and
bring
his
commanding
name
into
support
of
the
evolution
theory
of
development
will
prove
utterly
futile
in
the
light
of
his
archetype
and
the
persistency
with
which
he
concedes
that
nature
adheres
to
perfected
forms
goethe
accepts
the
doctrine
of
beyond
the
influence
of
which
no
developmental
progress
can
be
made
in
the
way
of
diversifying
or
variegating
ideal
types
in
other
words
he
virtually
fixes
limits
to
variability
from
the
outermost
circumference
of
which
reversion
must
inevitably
take
place
his
whole
doctrine
may
be
summed
up
generally
if
not
specially
in
these
words
the
animal
is
fashioned
circumstances
circumstances
as
the
eagle
to
the
air
and
mountain
top
the
mole
to
the
loose
soil
in
which
it
burrows
the
seal
to
the
water
in
which
he
frolics
and
the
bat
to
the
cave
the
twilight
and
the
night
air
we
should
rather
say
that
the
animal
is
fashioned
after
the
great
architect
pattern
circumstances
and
is
only
varied
circumstances
and
that
within
the
narrowest
limits
of
variability
for
the
most
that
goethe
means
by
his
archetype
is
an
ideal
pattern
after
which
or
on
which
a
natural
group
of
plants
or
animals
has
been
fashioned
within
the
limits
of
possible
variability
but
by
whose
mind
or
rather
within
whose
mind
was
this
ideal
pattern
this
essential
archetype
fashioned
whence
this
ideal
type
this
natural
group
this
pervading
all
nature
and
fashioning
all
organic
matter
not
from
the
mind
of
goethe
certainly
nor
from
that
of
aristotle
or
lucretius
but
from
the
one
supreme
mind
of
the
universe
in
which
the
groups
of
all
living
things
were
originally
fashioned
in
the
archetypal
world
that
world
which
according
to
bolingbroke
contains
intelligibly
all
that
is
contained
sensibly
in
our
world
this
archetypal
doctrine
of
goethe
coupled
as
he
couples
it
with
the
influences
of
environment
or
necessary
external
conditions
with
typical
modifications
only
while
it
entirely
harmonizes
with
the
bible
genesis
of
types
everything
modeled
after
its
kind
is
far
from
aiding
or
in
any
way
abetting
the
materialistic
hypothesis
of
haeckel
unless
we
make
nature
at
once
the
creator
and
modifier
of
her
own
archetype
and
even
then
the
variability
of
species
remains
unaccounted
for
except
as
we
attribute
to
nature
a
to
modify
persistent
forms
under
a
law
that
is
immutable
even
in
its
variability
for
the
assumption
of
an
archetype
carries
with
it
an
archetypal
plan
and
purpose
with
a
degree
of
intelligence
either
in
or
above
nature
capable
at
once
of
conceiving
the
type
and
determining
the
limits
of
its
variability
the
question
is
not
therefore
as
many
may
seem
to
think
whether
species
originate
by
miracle
or
by
law
but
whether
laws
and
causes
can
exist
independently
of
any
predetermining
will
or
agency
in
the
universe
our
language
and
that
of
all
civilized
peoples
on
the
globe
must
be
thoroughly
recast
not
only
in
its
philological
and
etymological
character
but
in
its
ideologic
etiologic
and
other
significations
before
we
can
successfully
fall
back
on
an
antecedent
cause
without
an
effect
or
an
effect
without
an
antecedent
cause
besides
the
human
mind
would
have
to
undergo
as
complete
a
subversion
of
structure
as
language
itself
before
any
such
attempt
at
recasting
it
on
the
basis
of
modern
materialistic
ideas
could
possibly
prove
successful
and
then
at
least
of
our
language
would
have
to
disappear
in
this
iconoclastic
reform
for
instance
take
any
synopsis
of
our
categories
and
their
relations
and
they
would
nearly
all
have
to
be
recast
or
entirely
abandoned
time
space
matter
motion
intellect
abstract
ideas
volitions
affections
with
their
several
correlates
or
would
all
have
to
undergo
a
thorough
recasting
process
the
personal
intersocial
sympathetic
moral
and
religious
relations
and
obligations
would
have
to
be
summarily
set
aside
for
future
revision
if
not
for
sweeping
rejection
all
our
ideas
of
life
materiality
spirituality
animality
vegetability
sensibility
would
have
to
fall
into
greater
or
less
desuetude
the
language
disappearing
with
the
ideas
all
the
words
expressing
our
ideas
of
a
superhuman
agency
of
god
angels
heaven
revelation
religious
doctrines
sentiments
acts
of
worship
piety
human
accountability
to
divine
institutions
rites
ceremonies
to
say
nothing
of
maleficent
spirits
mythological
and
other
fabulous
divinities
entering
so
largely
into
the
spirit
and
machinery
of
all
our
best
poetry
would
utterly
disappear
from
our
language
all
our
churches
minsters
chapels
tabernacles
cathedrals
and
temples
erected
to
the
living
god
embracing
the
finest
and
most
majestic
architecture
of
the
world
would
have
to
succumb
to
the
iconoclastic
zeal
of
these
materialistic
reformers
the
ten
categories
of
aristotle
would
disappear
in
the
one
category
of
haeckel
or
possibly
the
two
categories
of
bastian
matter
and
motion
philologically
speaking
we
should
all
be
at
sea
drifting
like
a
set
of
on
a
wide
and
inaudible
ocean
all
inarticulate
voiceless
with
only
the
screeching
of
the
or
some
other
sepulchral
bird
of
the
night
to
greet
us
as
in
derision
of
our
speechlessness
and
folly
but
let
us
see
how
the
incontestible
facts
of
nature
and
the
truths
of
science
fit
into
the
three
simple
hebrew
words
referring
to
germs
or
the
germinal
principle
of
life
instead
of
the
natural
seeds
of
plants
or
trees
we
have
given
what
we
claim
to
be
the
true
rendering
of
these
words
to
show
how
perfectly
they
harmonize
with
all
the
phenomenal
manifestations
of

we
hurriedly

iii
alternations
of
forest
growths
no
fact
has
more
profoundly
puzzled
the
vegetable
physiologist
than
the
alternations
of
forest
growths
which
are
everywhere
occurring
without
the
apparent
interposition
of
natural
seeds
and
which
have
been
considered
as
wholly
inexplicable
except
as
one
unsatisfactory
theory
after
another
has
been
suggested
to
account
for
the
wide
dissemination
and
distribution
of
their
seeds
we
have
had
any
number
of
these
theories
more
or
less
ingeniously
constructed
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
none
of
them
satisfactorily
accounts
for
more
than
a
very
limited
number
of
the
phenomena
presented
it
is
only
within
a
comparatively
recent
period
that
these
alternations
of
timber
growth
have
attracted
the
attention
of
scientific
men
consequently
little
more
than
crude
suggestions
and
facts
are
at
the
command
of
the
general
reader
and
writer
and
yet
the
facts
themselves
such
as
they
are
would
fill
a
dozen
volumes
of
the
size
of
hough
recent
report
upon
american
forestry
we
can
only
give
a
few
of
the
more
important
facts
we
have
gathered
and
many
of
these
are
so
deficient
in
necessary
detail
that
their
value
is
greatly
lessened
for
scientific
uses
this
is
especially
true
of
nearly
all
those
noticed
and
collated
by
hough
in
his
report
to
the
united
states
commissioner
of
agriculture
made
in
in
which
the
alternations
in
question
are
referred
to
at
length
but
no
new
suggestions
presented
nor
any
very
important
new
facts
given
if
our
construction
of
the
bible
genesis
be
the
correct
one
it
will
we
think
be
unhesitatingly
admitted
that
all
the
facts
collected
and
collated
by
hough
together
with
others
more
carefully
noticed
by
our
ablest
writers
on
vegetable
physiology
not
only
harmonize
with
this
ancient
hebrew
text
but
so
completely
fit
into
it
both
in
its
implications
and
explications
that
adverse
criticism
will
be
awed
into
silence
rather
than
provoked
into
any
new
controversy
on
the
subject
this
remarkable
genesis
declares
that
the
germs
of
all
living
things
are
in
themselves
upon
the
earth
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
it
is
true
that
this
declaration
as
contained
in
the
verse
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
is
textually
limited
to
the
vegetation
of
the
earth
but
the
further
emphatic
statement
that
the
animating
principle
of
life
is
in
the
earth
coupled
with
the
more
substantive
fact
that
god
commanded
the
waters
and
the
earth
to
bring
forth
abundantly
of
every
living
creature
with
the
single
exception
of
man
conclusively
extends
the
language
of
the
verse
to
whatever
vegetable
and
animal
life
the
earth
was
specifically
directed
to
bring
forth
it
is
our
purpose
to
consider
in
this
connection
not
only
the
various
facts
noticed
and
theories
suggested
by
our
ablest
writers
and
thinkers
on
the
subject
of
but
to
ascertain
as
far
as
possible
to
what
extent
their
several
facts
and
theories
harmonize
with
natural
phenomena
and
at
the
same
time
determine
what
disposition
should
be
made
of
them
in
the
light
of
this
new
genesis
herein
for
the
first
time
disclosed
professor
george
marsh
in
his
work
on
man
and
nature
in
which
he
treats
largely
of
forestry
in
europe
says
that
when
a
forest
old
enough
to
have
witnessed
the
mysteries
of
the
druids
is
felled
trees
of
other
species
spring
up
in
its
place
and
when
they
in
their
turn
fall
before
the
axe
sometimes
even
as
soon
as
they
have
spread
their
protecting
shade
over
the
surface
the
germs
which
their
predecessors
had
shed
perhaps
centuries
before
sprout
up
and
in
due
time
if
not
choked
by
other
trees
belonging
to
a
later
stage
in
the
order
of
natural
succession
restore
again
the
original
wood
in
these
cases
the
seeds
of
the
new
crop
may
have
been
brought
by
the
wind
by
birds
by
quadrupeds
or
by
other
causes
but
in
many
instances
explanation
is
not
it
is
manifest
that
professor
marsh
uses
the
word
germs
in
this
connection
in
the
sense
of
seeds
only
for
no
trees
shed
any
other
germs
than
the
natural
seeds
they
bear
and
while
he
admits
that
in
many
instances
the
generally
accepted
theory
concerning
the
dissemination
of
seeds
is
not
a
probable
one
he
still
clings
to
the
exploded
notion
that
vegetable
physiology
furnishes
a
record
of
numerous
instances
where
seeds
have
grown
after
lying
dormant
for
ages
in
the
earth
he
further
says
in
the
same
connection
that
their
vitality
seems
almost
imperishable
while
they
remain
in
the
situations
in
which
nature
deposits
them
although
he
is
reluctant
to
accept
the
accounts
of
the
growth
of
seeds
which
had
lain
for
ages
in
the
ashy
dryness
of
the
egyptian
catacombs
believing
that
they
should
be
received
with
great
caution
if
not
rejected
altogether
but
why
he
should
scruple
about
receiving
these
speculative
accounts
of
ancient
egyptian
cereals
which
are
sometimes
hawked
about
the
country
for
two
and
three
dollars
a
seed
and
in
the
same
breath
accept
the
absurder
theory
that
seeds
may
lie
dormant
for
ages
in
soils
where
the
hardest
and
most
enduring
woods
will
utterly
perish
and
disappear
in
a
few
brief
years
is
wholly
inexplicable
to
us
except
as
an
hypothesis
to
force
a
conclusion
or
to
account
for
the
otherwise
unaccountable
alternations
of
forest
growths
but
the
idea
that
nature
has
any
cunning
devices
by
which
she
may
hide
seeds
away
where
they
will
remain
almost
imperishable
for
ages
is
not
entirely
new
with
professor
marsh
nor
is
it
any
suggestion
that
would
be
protected
by
copyright
in
finding
the
winds
birds
quadrupeds
and
other
assumed
agencies
of
distribution
improbable
he
seeks
with
dwight
for
the
seeds
of
an
ancient
vegetation
and
finding
none
by
actual
observation
concludes
that
nature
has
some
occult
and
thoroughly
surreptitious
method
of
hiding
them
away
even
in
soils
below
the
last
glacial
drift
where
no
microscope
can
possibly
reach
them
as
the
accounts
of
seeds
taken
from
the
of
egypt
may
answer
the
purposes
of
those
seeking
to
palm
off
some
new
cereal
as
a
wonder
on
the
ignorant
so
these
speculations
about
the
indestructibility
of
seeds
when
hidden
away
by
nature
may
answer
a
like
purpose
in
imposing
upon
the
but
they
will
hardly
be
accepted
by
the
intelligent
much
less
the
scientific
in
the
light
of
all
the
facts
herein
given
the
simple
truth
is
that
all
seeds
are
speedily
perishable
by
exposure
we
hardly
know
a
single
seed
that
will
survive
beyond
the
second
year
when
subjected
to
such
exposure
if
they
do
not
germinate
the
first
year
their
vitality
is
utterly
gone
the
second
year
as
hopelessly
so
as
if
they
had
been
cast
into
the
fire
and
consumed
to
ashes
but
there
is
a
large
class
of
vegetable
phenomena
which
wholly
excludes
the
idea
of
this
wonderful
vitality
of
seeds
it
is
well
known
that
soil
brought
up
from
deep
wells
and
other
excavations
often
produces
plants
entirely
unlike
the
prevailing
local
flora
this
soil
has
been
brought
up
in
many
instances
from
beneath
the
last
glacial
drift
where
it
must
have
remained
for
not
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
years
at
the
lowest
calculation
and
may
have
remained
for
millions
of
years
if
not
longer
and
yet
the
same
singular
phenomenon
is
presented
exposed
to
the
rays
and
the
fructifying
influences
of
showers
and
dews
the
soil
burgeons
forth
into
an
independent
flora
and
such
as
are
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
surrounding
locality
the
writer
in
digging
a
well
in
waukesha
a
place
now
famous
for
the
curative
properties
of
its
waters
in
struck
soil
at
a
depth
of
about
feet
that
which
was
evidently
the
place
is
some
twenty
miles
back
from
milwaukee
and
the
whole
section
far
into
the
interior
of
the
state
from
lake
michigan
is
one
of
drift
covering
the
primeval
soil
at
various
depths
from
a
few
feet
up
to
a
hundred
or
more
and
the
imbedded
soil
must
have
remained
in
its
place
for
untold
ages
and
yet
it
was
no
sooner
brought
to
the
surface
than
it
produced
several
small
plants
that
were
wholly
unlike
the
prevailing
local
flora
although
unfortunately
they
did
not
sufficiently
mature
to
enable
us
to
determine
their
genera
and
species
considerable
portions
of
this
soil
were
dried
and
subjected
by
us
and
the
late
john
a
savage
then
president
of
carroll
college
to
microscopic
examination
but
without
discovering
the
slightest
trace
of
any
seed
or
anything
resembling
seed
in
the
several
portions
carefully
examined
the
soil
however
contained
in
its
imbedded
place
several
large
norway
spruce
logs
in
a
more
or
less
perfect
state
of
preservation
but
there
were
no
cones
nor
chits
to
cones
to
be
found
in
it
although
the
most
rigid
examination
was
made
at
the
time
to
discover
them
that
the
seeds
of
these
delicate
little
plants
should
have
survived
the
wreck
of
this
ancient
norwegian
forest
or
the
drift
from
one
and
burst
forth
into
newness
of
life
after
hundreds
of
thousands
not
to
say
millions
of
years
is
decidedly
too
large
a
draft
upon
our
credulity
to
be
honored
without
sight
but
we
will
return
to
the
alternations
of
forest
growths
it
is
within
a
comparatively
recent
period
that
extensive
areas
of
hemlock
in
greene
and
ulster
counties
were
cut
off
to
supply
the
neighboring
tanneries
with
bark
these
clearings
were
no
sooner
made
than
oak
chestnut
birch
and
other
trees
of
deciduous
foliage
sprang
up
and
entirely
usurped
the
place
of
the
hemlock
for
the
reason
no
doubt
that
the
soil
had
become
chemically
unbalanced
for
the
growth
of
the
latter
while
its
condition
was
entirely
favorable
for
the
development
of
the
germs
not
the
natural
seed
of
the
former
these
changes
in
timber
growths
have
been
widely
noticed
in
all
parts
of
this
country
as
well
as
in
europe
but
the
universal
supposition
has
been
that
they
came
from
the
natural
seeds
of
their
respective
localities
those
either
scattered
by
the
winds
or
borne
thither
by
the
birds
by
quadrupeds
or
by
some
other
natural
agency
no
one
has
suggested
the
theory
of
primordial
germs
or
vital
units
or
come
any
nearer
to
it
than
dwight
did
in
suggesting
the
seeds
of
an
ancient
vegetation
the
great
truth
of
the
bible
genesis
has
been
wholly
overlooked
by
reason
of
a
faulty
translation
in
the
first
instance
as
taken
from
the
masoretic
renderings
of
the
sixth
century
and
implicitly
followed
since
in
a
violent
tornado
swept
a
wide
strip
of
forest
in
northern
new
york
from
the
more
thickly
settled
portions
of
jefferson
county
to
lake
champlain
the
timber
that
succumbed
to
the
force
of
the
tornado
and
growing
at
various
points
along
its
track
was
mainly
beech
maple
birch
ash
hemlock
spruce
etc
but
it
was
rarely
replaced
at
any
point
by
the
same
timber
in
the
growths
that
almost
immediately
followed
the
trees
that
are
now
growing
along
the
track
of
the
tornado
are
principally
poplar
cherry
birch
and
a
little
beech
and
ironwood
no
ash
maple
spruce
or
hemlock
except
here
and
there
at
considerable
intervals
a
tree
or
two
which
may
have
been
replaced
by
natural
seed
the
important
fact
noticeable
in
this
connection
is
that
the
aggressive
timber
that
replacing
the
old
entirely
usurped
the
place
of
the
evergreen
growths
supplanting
them
with
those
that
were
wholly
deciduous
besides
it
does
not
appear
that
the
poplar
the
cherry
and
the
ironwood
which
were
altogether
aggressive
previously
grew
near
enough
to
the
track
of
the
tornado
to
have
possibly
supplied
the
seed
necessary
for
their
appearance
and
growth
the
fact
was
specially
noticeable
at
the
time
and
has
been
widely
communicated
since
that
the
white
oak
timber
cut
off
at
valley
forge
for
fuel
and
other
army
purposes
in
the
american
camp
in
the
winter
of
was
succeeded
by
black
oak
hickory
chestnut
the
white
oak
entirely
disappearing
although
by
far
the
most
favorably
situated
for
propagation
by
seed
but
the
alternations
of
forest
growths
had
attracted
too
little
attention
at
that
time
to
render
the
meagre
facts
given
of
any
special
value
to
scientific
men
if
the
usurping
timber
had
grown
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
a
fact
not
stated
it
might
have
come
from
natural
seeds
and
not
from
primordial
germs
under
favoring
conditions
in
the
ohio
agricultural
report
of
an
account
is
given
of
a
in
that
state
which
swept
for
a
considerable
distance
and
was
violent
enough
to
bear
down
all
the
timber
before
it
it
is
stated
that
the
path
of
this
tornado
which
must
have
occurred
many
years
ago
had
grown
up
with
another
and
different
growth
from
that
prostrated
by
the
force
of
the
storm
in
this
instance
there
were
no
neighboring
trees
except
perhaps
at
distant
intervals
from
which
the
nuts
of
the
could
have
been
derived
unless
they
had
been
promiscuously
strewn
by
the
tornado
along
its
entire
track
but
it
is
unfortunately
not
stated
that
the
tornado
occurred
at
that
opportune
season
of
the
year
when
the
nuts
were
properly
matured
for
planting
in
many
parts
of
the
united
states
particularly
in
the
south
and
west
the
paths
of
local
tornadoes
those
sweeping
the
native
forests
long
before
the
axe
of
civilization
invaded
them
may
still
be
traced
by
the
alternations
of
timber
growths
extending
for
long
distances
and
through
forests
where
there
were
no
neighboring
trees
from
which
it
was
possible
that
their
seeds
could
have
been
derived
one
of
these
tornadoes
the
writer
traced
many
years
ago
as
early
as
in
south
alabama
and
he
is
satisfied
both
from
observation
and
reading
that
the
instances
are
rare
if
not
altogether
exceptional
where
the
clean
path
of
a
tornado
through
any
of
our
primitive
forests
has
been
succeeded
by
the
same
growth
of
timber
as
that
borne
down
by
the
winds
where
the
path
of
this
ancient
tornado
of
alabama
swept
through
a
pine
forest
a
clean
growth
of
oak
was
buttressed
on
either
side
by
pine
and
where
it
swept
an
oak
forest
and
it
is
certain
that
the
tornado
whenever
it
may
have
occurred
could
have
exhibited
no
such
discriminating
freak
as
alternately
to
distribute
acorns
in
pine
growths
and
pine
cones
in
oak
growths
either
to
make
good
a
scientific
theory
or
balk
an
unscientific
one
professor
agassiz
in
passing
through
a
dense
young
spruce
forest
some
years
ago
on
the
south
shore
of
lake
superior
noticed
that
the
ground
was
thickly
strewn
with
fallen
birch
trunks
showing
that
their
place
had
been
but
recently
usurped
by
the
spruce
and
he
supposed
that
the
birch
had
first
succumbed
to
the
force
of
the
winds
and
the
spruce
promptly
taken
its
place
since
as
a
general
rule
an
evergreen
growth
succeeds
a
deciduous
and
we
have
any
number
of
well
authenticated
facts
similar
to
this
stated
by
professor
agassiz
but
we
can
not
give
place
to
them
in
this
connection
without
greatly
exceeding
our
limits
franklin
hough
in
his
recent
report
upon
american
forestry
to
which
we
have
already
referred
says
it
is
not
unusual
to
observe
in
the
swamps
of
the
northern
states
an
alternation
of
growth
taking
place
without
human
agency
extensive
tracts
of
tamarack
may
be
seen
in
northern
wisconsin
that
are
dying
out
and
being
succeeded
by
the
balsam
fir
which
may
be
probably
caused
by
the
partial
drainage
of
the
swamps
from
the
decay
or
removal
of
a
fallen
tree
that
had
obstructed
the
outlet
the
writer
of
this
work
resided
for
a
period
of
ten
years
or
more
in
wisconsin
and
during
that
time
traversed
extensive
portions
of
its
territory
both
before
and
after
it
became
a
state
as
early
as
the
extensive
tamarack
swamps
of
that
region
were
manifestly
dying
out
for
the
want
of
the
proper
nutritious
elements
in
the
soil
and
the
balsam
fir
rapidly
taking
its
place
especially
where
the
accumulations
of
soil
resulting
from
decayed
vegetation
were
favorable
for
its
appearance
the
drainage
of
the
swamps
had
not
been
thought
of
at
that
time
nor
had
the
swamps
themselves
been
disposed
of
to
any
considerable
extent
by
the
federal
government
they
were
subsequently
granted
to
the
state
for
educational
purposes
and
afterwards
purchased
up
in
the
interest
of
speculative
parties
but
the
decay
of
the
tamarack
had
really
commenced
long
before
population
found
its
way
in
any
considerable
numbers
into
that
section
of
the
country
and
the
balsam
fir
had
begun
its
usurpation
in
many
of
the
swamps
long
prior
to
the
advent
there
of
the
white
man
neither
artificial
drainage
nor
accidental
drainage
had
anything
to
do
with
the
appearance
of
the
balsam
fir
or
the
disappearance
of
the
tamarack
the
latter
was
manifestly
dying
out
for
the
want
of
the
proper
nutriment
and
the
former
coming
in
for
the
reason
that
the
soil
was
chemically
balanced
for
the
development
of
its
primordial
germs
those
everywhere
implanted
in
the
earth
to
await
the
necessary
conditions
for
their
development
and
growth
the
natural
seeds
of
this
balsam
fir
were
not
present
in
either
the
first
second
or
third
tamarack
swamp
in
which
this
alternation
of
growth
originally
took
place
the
change
commenced
as
soon
as
conditions
favored
and
not
before
it
is
safe
to
say
that
in
none
of
these
tamarack
swamps
was
there
a
single
balsam
fir
cone
or
a
single
chit
to
a
cone
nor
had
there
probably
been
for
thousands
of
years
before
the
time
when
the
first
balsam
fir
made
its
appearance
in
that
section
they
came
as
all
primordial
forests
come
from
germs
not
from
the
seeds
of
trees
universally
the
germ
precedes
the
tree
as
the
tree
precedes
the
seed
in
all
vegetal
growths
from
the
lowest
cryptogam
to
the
lordliest
conifer
of
the
pacific
slope
otherwise
we
should
be
logically
driven
back
to
an
act
of
specific
creation
which
the
materialist
stoutly
rejects
and
the
bible
genesis
nowhere
affirms
george
emerson
in
his
valuable
work
on
the
trees
and
shrubs
of
massachusetts
suggests
as
a
cause
undoubtedly
the
true
one
for
the
dying
out
of
old
forests
the
exhaustion
of
the
nutritious
elements
of
the
soil
required
for
their
vigorous
and
successful
growth
but
he
is
evidently
at
fault
in
his
speculations
as
to
the
alternations
of
forest
growths
the
cretan
labyrinth
that
everywhere
confronts
him
is
the
which
is
so
inextricable
to
him
that
he
constantly
stumbles
as
one
scientifically
blind
yet
eager
to
lead
the
blind
all
the
phenomenal
facts
with
which
he
deals
admirably
fit
into
the
bible
genesis
but
he
fails
to
see
it
because
the
sublime
truth
with
him
lies
locked
up
in
an
unmeaning
translation
he
is
indefatigable
however
in
his
hunt
after
seeds
where
there
are
no
seeds
and
in
his
jumps
at
conclusions
where
there
are
manifestly
no
data
to
justify
them
he
says
nature
points
out
in
various
ways
and
the
observation
of
practical
men
has
almost
uniformly
confirmed
the
conclusion
to
which
the
philosophical
botanist
has
come
from
theoretical
considerations
that
a
rotation
of
crops
is
as
important
in
the
forests
as
in
the
cultivated
fields
and
he
supplements
this
statement
measurably
a
true
one
by
adding
that
a
pine
forest
is
often
without
the
agency
of
man
succeeded
by
an
oak
forest
there
were
a
few
oaks
previously
scattered
through
the
woods
to
furnish
this
is
a
very
cautious
as
well
as
circumspect
statement
but
one
that
emerson
would
not
have
made
had
his
experience
and
observation
been
that
of
professor
agassiz
professor
marsh
and
others
we
might
name
his
few
oaks
previously
scattered
through
the
woods
are
no
doubt
among
the
theoretical
considerations
taken
into
account
by
him
as
a
philosophical
botanist
rather
than
a
practical
one
they
were
necessary
for
the
extreme
caution
with
which
he
would
state
a
proposition
when
its
conditioning
facts
were
not
fully
known
by
him
his
anxiety
to
account
for
the
appearance
of
an
oak
forest
in
the
place
of
a
pine
where
the
latter
had
been
cut
off
was
commendable
enough
to
justify
him
in
a
pretty
broad
supposition
but
not
in
any
such
general
statement
as
he
here
makes
had
he
consulted
any
of
the
older
inhabitants
of
westford
littleton
and
adjoining
towns
in
his
own
state
he
would
have
found
that
not
a
few
oak
forests
had
succeeded
the
pine
without
the
intervention
of
scattered
oaks
or
even
scattered
acorns
in
the
localities
named
nor
would
his
of
distribution
have
been
very
confidently
adhered
to
fifty
years
ago
in
localties
where
the
shagbark
walnut
was
almost
as
abundant
as
the
white
oak
itself
no
squirrel
will
gather
acorns
where
he
can
possibly
get
hickory
nuts
and
few
will
gather
hickory
nuts
where
the
larger
and
walnuts
are
to
be
had
for
the
picking
the
squirrel
is
provident
but
no
more
so
than
he
is
fastidious
in
the
choice
of
his
food
he
never
plants
acorns
except
for
his
own
gratification
and
is
never
gratified
with
indifferent
food
so
long
as
he
can
command
that
which
is
to
his
liking
in
further
speaking
of
the
exhausted
elements
of
the
soil
those
necessary
for
the
food
of
trees
as
well
as
plants
and
without
which
they
inevitably
perish
and
disappear
emerson
says
this
is
clearly
indicated
in
what
is
constantly
going
on
in
the
forests
particularly
the
fact
which
i
have
already
stated
and
which
is
abundantly
confirmed
by
my
correspondents
that
a
forest
of
one
kind
is
frequently
succeeded
a
spontaneous
growth
of
trees
of
another
in
the
sense
in
which
he
manifestly
uses
the
term
spontaneous
in
this
connection
his
new
forest
might
be
accounted
for
on
the
theory
of
primordial
germs
but
not
on
that
of
seeds
for
few
trees
or
shrubs
in
massachusetts
bear
winged
seeds
or
possess
any
other
means
of
dispersion
the
family
excepted
than
those
common
to
our
general
forest
growths
spontaneity
in
a
strictly
scientific
sense
is
not
predicable
upon
the
artificial
or
chance
sowing
of
either
acorns
hickory
nuts
or
the
chits
to
pine
cones
a
spontaneous
growth
implies
a
process
which
is
neither
usual
nor
accidental
a
growth
without
external
cause
but
from
inherent
natural
tendency
and
it
is
questionable
whether
there
is
any
such
process
in
nature
it
belongs
to
the
same
class
of
idle
speculations
as
spontaneous
generation
in
the
infusorial
world
a
subject
that
will
be
considered
as
we
advance
in
this
work
our
vegetable
physiologists
emerson
among
the
number
are
simply
unfortunate
in
their
use
of
terms
those
expressing
even
the
commonest
operations
of
nature
in
their
genesis
of
plants
and
trees
they
need
to
adhere
a
little
more
closely
to
the
genesis
of
induction
and
use
language
in
harmony
with
the
phenomenal
facts
and
characteristics
which
they
are
called
upon
to
explain
but
emerson
was
not
alone
at
fault
in
this
almost
universal
slip
of
the
scientific
pen
he
quotes
from
a
letter
of
sanderson
of
east
whately
in
which
the
writer
says
there
is
an
instance
on
my
farm
of
spruce
and
hackmatack
being
succeeded
by
a
spontaneous
growth
of
maple
wood
and
he
adds
that
instances
are
also
mentioned
by
him
sanderson
of
beech
and
maple
succeeding
oaks
oaks
following
pines
and
the
reverse
hemlock
succeeded
by
white
birch
in
cold
places
and
by
hard
maple
in
warm
ones
beech
succeeded
by
maple
elm
etc
and
in
fact
the
occurrence
was
so
common
that
surprise
was
expressed
at
the
asking
of
the
question
these
several
alternations
in
timber
growths
effectually
vouched
for
by
emerson
occurring
spontaneously
as
stated
can
hardly
be
accounted
for
on
any
other
theory
than
the
presence
of
germs
and
favoring
conditions
such
as
we
have
named
in
connection
with
the
bible
genesis
they
might
possibly
be
explained
on
the
theory
of
scattered
seeds
if
the
several
growths
had
made
their
appearance
gradually
and
not
spontaneously
as
stated
the
misfortune
with
emerson
as
well
as
with
his
several
reliable
correspondents
was
that
his
facts
are
too
meagrely
imparted
in
the
necessary
details
to
draw
any
satisfactory
conclusions
from
them
such
as
the
nearness
or
distance
of
surrounding
trees
of
the
same
species
and
the
possible
chances
of
their
seeds
taking
lodgment
in
the
soil
from
which
they
grew
but
fortunately
there
are
facts
and
those
abundantly
substantiated
which
entirely
negative
the
presence
of
seeds
in
the
soils
where
these
spontaneous
growths
are
said
to
have
appeared
in
some
instances
they
cover
large
tracts
of
land
at
distances
of
thirty
forty
fifty
and
even
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
native
forest
from
which
seed
could
have
been
derived
dwight
in
the
second
volume
of
his
travels
mentions
visiting
a
town
in
vermont
panton
near
vergennes
in
which
a
piece
of
land
that
had
been
once
cultivated
but
was
afterwards
permitted
to
lie
waste
yielded
a
thick
and
vigorous
growth
of
hickory
there
was
not
a
single
hickory
tree
in
any
original
forest
within
fifty
miles
of
the
of
this
piece
of
land
he
says
the
native
growth
here
was
white
pine
of
which
i
did
not
see
a
single
stem
in
the
whole
grove
of
hickory
he
is
greatly
puzzled
to
account
for
this
isolated
growth
of
hickory
but
readily
concludes
that
the
fruit
was
too
heavy
to
be
carried
fifty
miles
by
birds
besides
he
adds
it
is
not
eaten
by
any
bird
indigenous
to
vermont
and
even
if
the
birds
had
carried
the
nuts
thither
not
one
of
them
could
have
been
planted
there
unless
the
bird
had
been
caught
and
destroyed
on
the
spot
and
the
nut
released
from
its
crop
this
might
account
for
the
appearance
of
a
single
tree
but
not
for
a
whole
grove
of
hickory
and
the
squirrels
certainly
could
not
have
been
provident
enough
to
plant
any
considerable
grove
in
this
particular
locality
and
nowhere
else
within
fifty
miles
of
it
the
winds
could
not
have
borne
them
that
distance
without
dropping
a
single
nut
by
the
way
and
there
is
only
one
supposition
left
which
is
that
indicated
in
the
bible
genesis
while
dwight
emphatically
rejects
the
transportation
theory
he
imagined
he
had
solved
the
difficulty
in
his
suggestion
that
the
cultivation
of
the
land
had
brought
up
the
seeds
of
a
former
forest
within
the
limits
of
vegetation
and
given
them
an
opportunity
to
vegetate
but
the
utter
absurdity
of
this
theory
may
be
demonstrated
by
any
one
inside
of
two
years
by
placing
hickory
nuts
in
different
soils
at
a
depth
to
which
an
ordinary
would
reach
in
cultivation
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
examining
those
that
did
not
germinate
the
first
year
the
commonest
observer
of
a
hickory
forest
knows
that
if
the
fallen
nuts
do
not
germinate
the
first
year
their
vitality
is
utterly
and
hopelessly
gone
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you
leave
the
nuts
on
the
ground
where
they
fall
or
place
them
one
inch
or
twenty
inches
beneath
the
soil
the
result
will
be
the
same
at
the
end
of
two
years
you
can
pulverize
them
between
thumb
and
finger
almost
as
easily
as
so
much
dried
loam
the
idea
of
deriving
a
new
forest
from
such
nuts
is
hardly
less
absurd
than
that
of
emptying
the
egyptian
catacombs
of
their
old
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
a
race
of
theban
kings
stalking
the
earth
as
before
the
foundations
of
either
carthage
or
rome
were
laid
dwight
was
a
very
close
and
accurate
observer
of
nature
and
suffered
few
of
even
the
minor
points
of
detail
to
escape
him
in
the
same
work
as
well
as
in
the
same
connection
he
gives
an
account
of
another
forest
which
he
supposes
sprang
spontaneously
from
the
seeds
of
an
ancient
vegetation
he
says
a
field
about
five
miles
from
northampton
mass
on
an
eminence
called
hill
was
cultivated
about
a
century
ago
the
native
growth
here
and
in
all
the
surrounding
region
was
wholly
oak
chestnut
etc
as
the
field
belonged
to
my
grandfather
i
had
the
best
opportunity
of
learning
its
history
it
contained
about
five
acres
in
the
form
of
an
irregular
parallelogram
as
the
savages
rendered
the
cultivation
dangerous
it
was
given
up
on
this
ground
there
sprang
up
a
grove
of
white
pines
covering
the
field
and
retaining
its
figure
exactly
so
far
as
i
remember
there
was
not
in
it
a
single
oak
or
chestnut
tree
and
he
adds
was
not
a
single
pine
whose
seeds
were
or
probably
had
for
ages
been
sufficiently
near
to
have
been
planted
on
this
he
supposes
however
that
the
seeds
pine
cone
chits
had
lain
dormant
for
ages
before
cultivation
brought
them
up
within
the
limits
of
vegetation
as
early
as
judge
peters
of
philadelphia
became
satisfied
that
all
that
elevated
region
around
the
head
waters
of
the
delaware
alleghany
and
genesee
rivers
then
covered
with
heavy
growths
of
hemlock
or
with
forests
of
beech
and
was
originally
an
oak
forest
probably
covering
most
of
that
entire
region
and
john
adlum
of
havre
de
grace
who
originally
surveyed
the
lands
south
of
the
great
bend
of
the
susquehanna
between
that
river
and
the
delaware
conceived
the
same
idea
as
early
as
the
section
surveyed
by
him
was
chiefly
covered
with
beech
and
in
fact
it
was
in
what
was
called
at
the
time
the
beech
and
country
he
drew
his
inferences
from
the
fact
that
he
found
here
and
there
at
irregular
intervals
red
and
white
oaks
growing
to
an
enormous
size
none
being
less
than
sixteen
feet
and
many
measuring
feet
or
more
in
circumference
five
feet
above
the
ground
he
says
that
the
hemlock
in
this
region
seems
to
have
succeeded
the
oak
while
the
beech
and
maple
no
doubt
succeeded
the
hemlock
this
last
inference
would
seem
to
have
been
made
from
the
fact
that
clumps
of
large
hemlock
trees
were
at
that
time
still
growing
at
intervals
among
the
larger
deciduous
trees
indeed
there
is
no
better
established
fact
in
vegetable
physiology
than
that
of
these
alternations
of
forest
growths
they
sometimes
come
on
gradually
but
in
a
majority
of
instances
they
make
their
appearance
at
once
on
the
cutting
off
of
old
forests
in
the
tracks
of
tornadoes
or
where
fire
has
devastated
extensive
regions
of
timber
from
the
facts
which
have
been
gathered
it
is
difficult
to
determine
any
regular
order
of
alternation
except
that
oaks
and
other
deciduous
trees
succeed
the
different
varieties
of
pine
and
other
evergreen
growths
and
perhaps
in
hough
report
upon
american
forestry
he
makes
a
brief
summary
of
the
order
of
these
alternations
in
different
sections
of
the
country
on
the
authority
of
persons
apparently
more
or
less
on
the
subject
but
by
no
means
accurate
observers
he
says
that
in
the
region
about
green
bay
overrun
by
the
fires
of
dense
growths
of
poplars
and
birches
have
sprung
up
and
are
growing
rapidly
but
he
omits
the
most
important
fact
of
all
in
his
failure
to
state
the
previous
growths
of
timber
or
whether
there
were
any
neighboring
growths
of
poplar
along
the
track
of
the
burnt
district
from
which
seed
might
have
been
derived
here
are
some
of
his
more
important
statements
at
clarksville
oak
and
hickory
lands
when
cleared
invariably
grew
up
with
pine
this
is
true
of
that
region
of
country
generally
at
aiken
the
pine
is
succeeded
by
oaks
and
other
deciduous
trees
and
in
bristol
county
in
some
cases
after
pines
have
been
cut
off
oak
maple
and
birch
have
sprung
up
abundantly
in
hancock
county
oaks
have
been
succeeded
by
hickories
in
east
hamburgh
erie
county
a
growth
of
hemlock
elm
and
soft
maple
was
succeeded
by
beech
soft
maple
and
hard
maple
but
a
good
deal
more
of
the
last
named
than
any
other
this
is
the
general
character
of
the
summary
given
and
if
its
object
were
simply
to
show
the
fact
that
these
alternations
actually
took
place
one
that
nobody
has
disputed
in
the
last
half
century
his
chapter
on
the
alternations
of
forest
growths
is
a
scientific
success
the
information
really
desired
in
these
cases
was
that
imparted
by
dwight
in
his
suggestive
work
of
travel
in
which
all
the
incidental
facts
and
surrounding
circumstances
are
fully
given
it
does
not
appear
from
any
of
the
foregoing
statements
given
as
a
specimen
that
there
were
any
neighboring
trees
sufficiently
near
to
have
supplied
seed
for
the
new
forests
taking
the
place
of
the
old
manifestly
the
most
important
physiological
fact
connected
with
the
whole
inquiry
whether
looking
to
proper
or
to
future
schools
of
forestry
certain
to
be
established
in
this
country
as
they
have
been
in
most
of
the
leading
countries
of
europe
it
is
however
stated
by
hough
in
his
voluminous
report
that
in
new
england
the
pine
without
giving
its
varieties
is
often
succeeded
by
the
white
birch
and
in
new
jersey
by
the
oak
the
succession
of
oak
by
pine
and
the
reverse
in
the
southern
states
and
it
is
further
stated
without
reference
to
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
different
soils
or
the
absence
or
presence
of
neighboring
that
poplars
and
other
soft
woods
are
very
often
found
coming
up
in
pine
districts
that
have
been
ravaged
by
fire
we
have
noticed
he
continues
in
nebraska
ash
elm
and
following
cottonwood
in
the
natural
starting
of
timber
in
the
prairie
region
of
illinois
where
the
stopping
of
fires
allowed
we
often
see
a
hazel
coppice
after
a
time
the
cratægus
and
finally
the
oaks
and
other
timber
these
growths
are
often
quite
aggressive
on
the
prairies
in
florida
the
oak
usually
takes
the
place
of
the
pine
in
all
these
cases
the
contiguousness
of
similar
or
dissimilar
growths
is
not
stated
he
nevertheless
cites
a
most
important
fact
respecting
the
alternations
of
timber
growth
noticed
by
sir
alexander
mackenzie
in
his
overland
journey
from
montreal
to
the
arctic
ocean
in
who
found
in
the
vicinity
of
slave
lake
that
the
banks
were
covered
with
large
quantities
of
burnt
wood
lying
on
the
ground
where
young
poplar
trees
had
sprung
up
immediately
after
the
destruction
of
the
previous
growths
by
fire
in
noticing
this
fact
the
indefatigable
english
explorer
remarks
it
is
a
very
curious
and
extraordinary
circumstance
that
land
covered
with
spruce
pine
and
white
birch
when
laid
waste
by
fire
should
subsequently
produce
nothing
but
poplars
none
of
that
species
of
tree
was
previously
to
be
found
but
facts
of
a
similar
character
are
too
numerous
and
to
be
questioned
by
any
intelligent
authority
and
they
all
point
to
but
one
solution
that
of
primordial
germs
quickened
into
life
by
the
necessary
environing
conditions
the
appearance
of
a
single
poplar
in
the
locality
named
or
even
a
dozen
of
them
for
that
matter
might
be
accounted
for
on
the
theory
that
a
bird
of
passage
had
dropped
them
there
after
the
fire
but
under
no
conceivable
circumstances
could
the
dispersion
of
the
requisite
amount
of
seed
to
plant
an
extensive
burnt
district
along
the
banks
of
slave
lake
have
occurred
on
any
other
theory
than
that
emphatically
set
forth
as
a
physiological
fact
in
the
bible
genesis
there
is
manifestly
importance
enough
attaching
to
this
subject
to
justify
a
much
wider
range
of
observation
and
inquiry
than
has
yet
been
made
pine
forests
have
been
cut
off
in
alabama
and
georgia
covering
extensive
areas
where
there
was
not
a
single
oak
tree
in
a
circuit
of
miles
and
yet
the
oak
has
promptly
made
its
appearance
in
several
varieties
over
the
whole
cleared
district
and
it
is
entirely
safe
to
say
that
had
the
ground
been
thoroughly
examined
from
the
surface
to
ten
feet
below
it
after
the
pine
had
been
felled
not
the
first
sign
of
an
acorn
could
have
been
met
with
anywhere
within
the
whole
area
of
the
clearing
no
matter
whether
it
covered
ten
acres
twenty
or
a
hundred
the
paths
of
the
tornadoes
we
have
referred
to
conclusively
show
this
the
forests
in
these
cases
do
not
come
from
seed
but
from
the
living
indestructible
vital
principles
implanted
in
the
earth
before
it
was
specifically
commanded
to
bring
forth
in
the
language
of
the
bible
genesis
the
materialists
like
professor
bastian
herbert
spencer
and
others
may
sneer
at
this
declaration
but
let
them
advance
some
rational
theory
to
the
contrary
to
account
for
these
alternations
of
forest
growths
before
they
lay
bare
the
joints
of
their
scientific
armor
too
confidently
to
the
thrusts
of
the
next
in
the
field
of
scientific
investigation
sneers
are
cheap
weapons
the
mere
of
pretension
and
frippery
but
they
never
bear
so
deadly
a
gibe
as
when
effectually
turned
on
the
sneerer
professor
moritz
wagner
in
his
description
of
mount
ararat
mentions
a
singular
phenomenon
to
which
his
guide
drew
his
attention
in
the
appearance
of
several
plants
on
soil
lately
thrown
up
by
an
earthquake
which
grew
nowhere
else
on
the
mountain
and
had
never
been
observed
in
this
that
region
before
this
writer
thereupon
goes
into
a
disquisition
upon
the
vitality
of
seeds
but
only
to
mar
the
value
of
his
very
important
observation
the
fact
that
these
new
plants
were
rejected
by
the
other
soil
of
the
mountain
that
not
thrown
up
by
the
earthquake
is
the
only
other
observation
of
value
made
by
this
writer
and
the
importance
of
this
one
observation
lies
in
the
apparent
if
not
conclusive
fact
that
the
conditions
of
the
other
soil
of
the
mountain
were
not
favorable
for
the
development
of
the
primordial
germs
or
vital
units
contained
in
that
which
was
thrown
up
by
the
earthquake
a
circumstance
that
most
materially
strengthens
the
view
we
have
taken
as
all
candid
and
impartial
readers
will
agree
darwin
inadvertently
makes
a
very
material
concession
in
favor
of
the
theory
we
have
advanced
although
unconscious
of
any
such
theory
except
that
so
broadly
and
unqualifiedly
put
forth
by
the
panspermists
as
to
meet
with
a
ready
refutation
he
is
laboring
of
course
to
strengthen
his
position
that
nature
eternally
works
to
get
rid
of
her
imperfect
forms
or
to
ensure
the
survival
of
the
fittest
but
while
his
facts
accomplish
little
in
this
direction
they
establish
much
in
another
as
the
reader
will
see
he
says
in
staffordshire
on
an
estate
of
a
relative
where
i
had
ample
means
of
investigation
there
was
a
large
and
extremely
barren
heath
which
had
never
been
touched
by
the
hand
of
man
but
several
hundred
acres
of
exactly
the
same
nature
had
been
enclosed
years
before
and
planted
with
scotch
fir
the
change
in
the
native
vegetation
of
the
planted
part
of
the
heath
was
most
remarkable
more
than
is
generally
seen
in
passing
from
one
quite
different
soil
to
another
not
only
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
heath
plants
were
wholly
changed
twelve
species
of
plants
not
including
grasses
and
sedges
flourished
in
the
plantation
which
could
not
be
found
on
the
heath
the
attempt
is
here
made
by
darwin
to
convey
an
altogether
different
meaning
to
his
facts
than
what
they
will
warrant
even
as
adroitly
handled
by
him
no
heath
plants
were
wholly
changed
in
characteristics
but
only
in
proportional
numbers
nor
did
the
twelve
new
species
of
plants
make
their
appearance
by
virtue
of
any
law
of
variability
or
selection
of
the
fittest
the
growth
of
scotch
fir
had
simply
changed
the
conditions
of
the
soil
so
that
certain
varieties
of
heath
growth
disappeared
for
the
want
of
necessary
conditions
and
certain
varieties
of
forest
growth
made
their
appearance
because
conditions
favored
similar
if
not
greater
changes
are
constantly
occurring
in
hundreds
of
localities
in
new
england
where
choked
and
pasture
lands
are
left
untouched
by
the
hand
of
man
to
grow
up
as
best
they
may
into
new
forests
the
plants
and
shrubs
entirely
disappear
as
the
stronger
and
more
aggressive
trees
taking
root
in
favoring
soils
advance
in
the
struggle
for
supremacy
while
the
less
hardy
and
more
modest
plants
those
quietly
seeking
shelter
in
the
woods
make
their
appearance
because
they
find
beneath
the
shade
of
the
usurping
forest
the
precise
conditions
necessary
for
their
more
successful
growth
no
perishable
seeds
have
been
awakened
from
their
sleep
of
untold
centuries
by
these
changed
conditions
of
the
soil
but
nature
everywhere
obeying
the
divine
mandate
brings
forth
her
implanted
life
in
all
its
bountiful
diversity
of
stalk
leaf
bud
bough
blossom
fruit
not
in
obedience
to
man
husbandry
alone
but
because
as
the
vicar
of
god
she
must
provide
for
her
benefice
let
the
earth
bring

is
the
eternal
fiat
nature
forever
heeds
it
and
forever
obeys
it
oh
ye
blind
guides
who
strain
at
a
gnat
and
swallow
a
camel
doubt
it
if
ye
will
but
forget
not
that
nature
has
her
compunctious
visitings
and
will
rise
up
in
insurrection
against
you
nothing
in
her
breast
lies
dormant
for
ages
or
even
for
an
hour
her
appointed
times
and
seasons
forbid
it
if
the
butterfly
does
not
sport
in
her
sunshine
it
is
because
it
lies
dead
in
its
shroud
and
can
never
become
a
butterfly
in
all
her
profusion
and
prodigality
flinging
her
glittering
jewels
even
in
over
all
her
enamored
woods
and
causing
her
little
fountains
to
leap
up
from
their
crystal
beds
in
delight
that
they
may
be
frozen
into
more
sparkling
jets
she
exhibits
no
such
munificence
as
in
her
unsparing
prodigality
of
life
to
be
prodigal
in
this
was
the
first
command
she
received
and
her
great
heart
constantly
throbs
to
give
it
expression
and
in
all
this
she
simply
obeys
a
kindly
law
which
has
been
implanted
in
her
bosom
and
can
never
be
displanted
she
has
no
need
of
seeds
in
her
cunning
laboratory
to
perpetuate
and
only
yields
them
to
man
for
use
and
not
abuse
he
can
utilize
them
if
he
will
so
that
all
things
of
beauty
and
promise
shall
be

in
the
language
of
her
greatest
and
most
profoundly
philosophical
poet
nature
never
lends
the
smallest
scruple
of
her
excellence
but
like
a
thrifty
goddess
she
determines
herself
the
glory
of
a
creditor
thanks
and
those
who
think
therefore
to
make
nature
a
debtor
by
reversing
her
laws
of
propagation
and
making
her
dependent
on
what
she
bestows
in
use
will
never
find
out
the
smallest
scruple
of
her
excellence
nor
add
to
her
glory
as
a
creditor
all
things
are
framed
in
her
prodigality
and
the
seeds
of
plants
and
trees
are
no
exception
to
the
quality
of
her
bestowals
we
may
reason
syllogize
speculate
as
we

chapter
iv
the
distribution
and
vitality
of
seeds
few
questions
have
attracted
more
attention
among
vegetable
physiologists
of
late
years
than
the
dispersion
and
migration
of
seeds
from
place
to
place
in
the
earth
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
none
has
been
more
unsatisfactorily
answered
in
the
case
of
quite
a
number
of
plants
and
trees
special
contrivances
would
seem
to
have
been
provided
by
nature
for
insuring
their
dispersion
as
well
as
migration
with
a
small
number
of
plants
for
instance
the
seeds
are
discharged
for
short
distances
by
the
explosive
force
of
their
when
properly
matured
an
equally
small
number
have
certain
membranous
contrivances
called
wings
by
which
they
may
be
borne
still
greater
distances
others
again
are
provided
with
light
feathery
tufts
to
which
the
seed
is
attached
and
these
may
be
carried
by
the
winds
several
miles
before
finding
a
lodgment
in
the
soil
while
many
others
are
inclosed
in
prickly
and
coverings
by
which
they
attach
themselves
to
animals
and
even
birds
and
may
be
transported
to
almost
any
distance
but
with
the
great
majority
of
plants
and
trees
as
the
seeds
fall
so
they
lie
and
must
continue
to
lie
until
they
either
germinate
or
perish
or
are
accidentally
dispersed
or
scattered
by
some
extrinsic
agency
the
anxiety
of
speculative
botanists
to
account
for
the
recognized
alternations
of
forest
and
other
growths
have
led
to
the
different
theories
of
transportation
we
have
named
and
when
these
theories
have
been
supplemented
by
the
alleged
wonderful
vitality
of
seeds
in
the
cunning
recesses
in
which
nature
manages
to
conceal
them
they
imagine
the
whole
difficulty
solved
when
in
point
of
fact
it
remains
wholly
unsolved
this
theory
of
the
wonderful
vitality
of
seeds
is
simply
one
as
we
have
said
to
force
a
conclusion
to
get
rid
of
a
lion
in
the
scientific
path
professor
marsh
with
other
eminent
and
scholarly
writers
on
vegetable
physiology
scouts
the
idea
that
the
seeds
of
some
of
our
cereal
crops
have
been
preserved
for
three
or
four
thousand
years
in
the
ashy
dryness
of
the
egyptian
catacombs
but
what
better
repository
in
which
to
preserve
them
certainly
none
of
our
modern
granaries
with
all
their
machinery
for
keeping
the
grain
dry
or
from
nor
are
the
catacombs
to
be
despised
as
compared
with
any
means
of
storage
yet
suggested
by
the
wit
of
man
the
only
means
nature
has
of
storage
or
rather
of
preservation
by
storage
is
to
welcome
the
seed
back
to
her
bosom
the
earth
from
which
its
sprang
where
it
may
be
speedily
quickened
into
life
and
bear
other
grain
not
itself
for
that
which
thou
sowest
is
not
quickened
except
it
die
and
much
more
is
that
dead
which
is
not
quickened
whenever
seed
is
thus
returned
to
nature
bosom
as
it
is
with
life
whether
it
quickens
or
not
it
dies
and
there
is
no
resurrection
for
dead
seed
from
the
earth
any
more
than
there
is
for
the
occupants
of
the
exhumed
of
ancient
thebes
the
belief
in
this
wonderful
vitality
of
seeds
in
the
positions
in
which
nature
deposits
them
is
pretty
much
on
a
par
with
that
which
assigns
a
thousand
years
to
the
life
of
a
crow
as
nobody
but
the
scholastic
fool
in
the
fable
has
ever
attempted
to
verify
the
correctness
of
this
latter
belief
so
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
the
experiment
of
verifying
the
former
will
not
be
successfully
undertaken
within
the
next
thousand
years
to
say
the
least
it
is
well
known
that
the
vitality
of
seeds
so
far
at
least
as
nature
handles
them
depends
upon
her
cunning
contrivances
for
their
preservation
as
well
as
their
dispersion
but
many
seeds
in
which
these
contrivances
would
seem
to
be
the
most
perfect
will
not
germinate
after
the
second
year
and
few
will
do
so
to
advantage
after
the
third
or
fourth
year
even
when
they
have
been
kept
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
or
in
uniform
dryness
and
temperature
farmers
who
have
had
practical
experience
in
this
matter
and
care
little
for
what
is
merely
theoretical
will
never
plant
seed
that
is
three
or
four
years
old
when
they
can
get
that
of
the
previous
year
growth
it
is
certain
that
no
hickory
nut
will
retain
its
vitality
beyond
the
first
year
of
its
exposure
to
a
new
england
soil
and
climate
and
few
seeds
are
better
protected
by
nature
against
such
exposure
and
it
is
equally
questionable
whether
the
chits
to
dwight
pine
cones
would
have
had
any
better
chance
of
survival
at
the
time
the
indians
infested
the
neighborhood
of
northampton
and
regularly
fired
the
woods
every
autumn
although
professor
marsh
confidently
says
in
his
work
on
man
and
nature
that
the
vitality
of
seeds
seems
almost
imperishable
while
they
remain
in
the
situations
in
which
nature
deposits
them
he
will
no
doubt
admit
that
this
statement
rests
on
no
experimental
knowledge
but
simply
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
new
forests
and
new
species
of
plants
to
which
he
refers
originated
from
seeds
and
not
from
primordial
germs

in
the
earth

if
the
ground
had
been
recently
sown
with
seed
he
also
mentions
as
a
more
or
less
remarkable
fact
that
a
house
which
was
known
to
have
existed
for
two
hundred
years
was
pulled
down
and
no
sooner
was
the
surface
soil
exposed
to
the
influence
of
light
and
moisture
than
it
became
covered
with
a
crop
of
or
charlock
and
he
instances
these
facts
to
show
that
the
seeds
of
this
charlock
and
these
dyke
plants
had
lain
dormant
in
the
soil
from
the
time
the
dykes
were
built
and
the
house
erected
but
these
physiological
facts
however
well
authenticated
they
may
have
been
are
no
more
conclusive
of
the
presence
of
dormant
seed
than
the
appearance
of
the
common
plantain
about
a
recently
built
where
none
ever
grew
before
is
proof
that
the
seeds
of
this
common
household
plant
had
lain
dormant
for
ages
before
the
house
was
erected
we
can
not
tell
why
this
common
plant
follows
the
domestic
household
any
more
than
we
can
tell
why
rats
follow
civilization
but
they
are
both
sufficiently
annoying
at
times
to
satisfy
us
that
they
follow
however
inexplicable
the
reason
may
be
the
same
writer
further
says
in
connection
with
the
foregoing
statements
instances
of
the
vitality
of
seeds
might
easily
be
multiplied
almost
indefinitely
but
we
shall
be
satisfied
with
noticing
one
of
a
very
extraordinary
kind
in
the
time
of
the
emperor
hadrian
a
man
died
soon
after
he
had
eaten
plentifully
of
raspberries
he
was
buried
at
dorchester
about
years
ago
the
remains
of
this
man
together
with
coins
of
the
roman
emperor
were
discovered
in
a
coffin
at
the
bottom
of
a
barrow
thirty
feet
under
the
surface
the
man
had
thus
lain
undisturbed
for
some
years
but
the
most
curious
circumstance
connected
with
the
case
was
that
raspberry
seeds
were
recovered
from
the
and
sown
in
the
garden
of
the
horticultural
society
where
they
germinated
and
grew
into
healthy
bushes
here
is
circumstantiality
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
unlimited
skepticism
provided
that
the
facts
were
satisfactorily
vouched
for
by
the
living
and
the
record
left
by
the
dead
were
sufficiently
explicit
in
detail
and
conclusive
in
identity
of
subject
then
to
suggest
even
a
reasonable
doubt
would
we
admit
be
equivalent
to
making
truth
a
circumstantial
liar
but
this
most
remarkable
story
will
bear
repetition
with
a
few
running
comments
the
man
presumably
a
roman
soldier
died
seventeen
hundred
years
ago
this
is
not
unlikely
he
died
of
eating
too
plentifully
of
raspberries
a
circumstance
not
altogether
improbable
he
was
buried
at
dorchester
where
of
course
there
were
no
records
of
deaths
and
burials
kept
at
the
time
and
hence
we
should
have
to
question
the
record
if
one
were
presented
he
was
also
buried
in
a
coffin
or
at
least
dug
up
in
one
this
statement
must
be
received
the
romans
never
used
coffins
and
under
the
empire
they
burnt
most
of
their
dead
after
a
battle
however
they
generally
piled
them
up
in
heaps
and
where
there
was
a
lack
of
fuel
to
burn
them
they
covered
them
with
the
surface
soil
taking
good
care
to
put
a
roman
coin
in
each
soldier
mouth
so
that
he
might
pay
the
ferryman
in
hades
there
was
feet
of
surface
soil
shoveled
on
top
of
this
particular
roman
showing
that
he
was
a
very
consequential
personage
in
camp
no
wonder
then
that
all
these
nice
particularities
of
statement
should
have
been
circumstantially
noted
in
the
commanding
general
order
of
the
day
and
thus
been
handed
down
to
posterity
for
the
future
advancement
of
science
he
had
lain
undisturbed
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
almost
any
one
would
have
done
so
with
that
amount
of
surface
soil
shoveled
on
top
of
him
the
seeds
were
recovered
from
his
stomach
that
is
after
improvidently
snatching
away
the
roman
soldier
life
they
took
good
care
to
preserve
their
own
as
well
as
the
stomach
in
which
they
were
deposited
the
seeds
were
planted
in
the
horticultural
society
garden
where
they
flourished
vigorously
all
these
circumstantially
narrated
facts
were
gathered
by
somebody
about
forty
years
ago
in
what
authentic
and
satisfactorily
verified
record
are
they
to
be
found
the
writer
gives
us
no
clue
the
stomach
the
coffin
the
roman
coins
some
of
the
wonderfully
preserved
seeds
as
well
as
the
in
the
mouth
of
the
dead
soldier
should
be
found
somewhere
they
could
not
have
disappeared
in
a
night
if
they
had
withstood
the
relentless
tooth
of
time
for
seventeen
hundred
years
in
the
surface
soil
of
dorchester
the
last
forty
years
ought
not
to
have
obliterated
all
trace
of
them
the
story
is
simply
too
incredible
for
belief
if
printed
in
forty
great
architects
of
nature
from
to
the
writer
went
into
any
number
of
wisconsin
mounds
those
not
essentially
dissimilar
from
the
roman
barrows
in
england
in
company
with
the
late
i
lapham
of
milwaukee
and
the
idea
of
finding
any
human
stomach
with
or
without
seeds
in
it
with
probably
not
half
the
time
intervening
between
burial
and
exhumation
as
in
the
case
of
this
roman
soldier
would
have
been
instantly
rejected
by
the
distinguished
archaeologist
accompanying
us
indeed
had
any
such
discovery
been
made
he
would
have
unhesitatingly
pronounced
the
mound
tampered
with
for
the
purposes
of
imposition
it
is
possible
that
surface
soil
containing
some
raspberry
seeds
may
have
been
taken
to
the
horticultural
society
garden
to
which
child
refers
and
planted
there
as
stated
but
that
they
were
from
a
human
stomach
that
had
lain
buried
for
seventeen
hundred
years
in
the
surface
soil
of
england
or
any
other
country
is
simply
preposterous
it
caps
the
climax
of
all
the
wonderful
yet
manufactured
for
the
scientific
mind
to
wrestle
with
it
is
easy
enough
to
find
soil
about
old
stumps
and
fallen
trunks
and
branches
of
trees
which
will
produce
raspberries
either
with
or
without
the
presence
of
seed
and
soil
might
have
been
taken
from
the
bottom
of
this
dorchester
barrow
which
produced
them
but
the
appearance
of
the
bushes
must
have
depended
on
the
conditions
of
the
soil
not
on
seeds
eaten
by
a
roman
soldier
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
that
version
of
the
story
must
be
summarily
dismissed
the
attention
of
scientific
men
professor
marsh
in
the
work
to
which
we
have
already
several
times
alluded
says
when
newly
cleared
ground
is
burnt
over
in
the
united
states
the
ashes
are
hardly
cold
before
they
are
covered
with
a
crop
of
a
tall
herbaceous
plant
very
seldom
growing
under
other
circumstances
and
often
not
to
be
found
for
a
distance
of
many
miles
from
the
clearing
the
botanical
name
of
this
plant
is
and
it
is
well
known
to
the
botanists
of
new
england
its
seeds
are
almost
as
destructible
by
fire
as
itself
and
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
of
the
seeds
borne
by
the
winds
or
by
birds
and
scattered
through
the
clearing
before
it
was
burned
could
have
survived
the
intense
heat
to
which
they
must
have
been
subjected
in
the
burning
off
of
a
heavy
and
dense
growth
of
felled
timber
the
seeds
if
any
must
have
been
scattered
after
the
fire
and
not
before
it
but
these
heavy
clearings
those
in
which
we
have
witnessed
the
most
abundant
crops
of
are
generally
burnt
off
in
the
early
spring
when
there
are
no
seeds
to
be
scattered
as
all
those
of
the
previous
year
growth
find
their
proper
lodgment
in
the
soil
before
the
winter
fully
closes
in
the
seeds
for
which
professor
marsh
would
have
to
search
therefore
would
be
those
in
some
corresponding
latitude
or
plant
zone
in
the
southern
not
within
thousands
of
miles
from
the
clearing
in
which
they
so
promptly
make
their
appearance
professor
marsh
suggests
however
that
they
may
have
come
from
the
deeply
buried
seeds
of
a
former
vegetation
quickened
into
life
by
the
heat
but
had
he
examined
these
plants
in
their
incipient
stages
of
growth
he
would
have
found
that
they
sprung
directly
from
the
surface
of
the
burnt
soil
their
initial
rootlets
hardly
extending
to
the
depth
of
of
an
inch
below
it
and
where
they
must
have
utterly
perished
from
the
heat
the
theory
he
suggests
is
the
only
possible
one
he
thinks
to
account
for
the
mystery
and
hence
its
suggestion
by
him
but
he
has
only
to
pass
one
of
the
delicate
seeds
of
this
plant
through
the
flame
of
a
candle
to
see
that
it
instantly
perishes
by
fire
his
suggested
theory
must
be
abandoned
therefore
and
that
of
the
bible
genesis
accepted
in
its
place
the
fact
is
and
it
ought
to
be
well
known
to
the
closer
student
of
nature
that
the
makes
its
appearance
in
the
conditions
of
the
burnt
soil
just
as
stramonium
does
in
the
conditions
of
the
soil
where
a
has
been
recently
burned
that
is
not
from
seed
but
from
vital
units
or
germs
everywhere
present
in
the
earth
those
taking
advantage
of
environing
conditions
just
as
or
spring
from
the
proper
organic
infusions
and
the
young
shoots
of
stramonium
in
a
recently
burned
will
be
found
to
spring
directly
from
the
surface
of
the
burnt
ground
where
all
seeds
and
living
organism
must
have
perished
in
the
heat
and
not
at
any
considerable
depth
below
it
their
first
appearance
is
on
the
immediate
surface
of
the
burnt
ground
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
and
at
a
time
when
there
were
no
seeds
to
be
distributed
except
such
as
must
have
come
from
the
southern
hemisphere
or
been
casually
picked
up
by
birds
and
taken
their
slim
chances
of
survival
after
passing
through
the
natural
gristmills
of
the
birds
and
even
this
supposition
would
only
account
for
the
appearance
of
a
single
stramonium
plant
or
two
not
for
a
thick
bed
of
it
covering
the
entire
ground
the
theory
of
in
this
and
other
cases
is
wholly
out
of
the
question
as
much
so
as
when
white
clover
makes
its
appearance
on
a
prairie
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
where
there
has
been
a
single
sprig
of
clover
growing
in
a
thousand
years
every
closely
observant
person
living
for
any
length
of
time
on
our
western
prairies
is
familiar
with
the
fact
that
when
the
rank
and
hardier
grasses
usually
growing
thereon
are
effectually
fed
down
by
stock
and
especially
by
sheep
the
prairie
grasses
disappear
and
the
ground
at
once
comes
in
with
white
clover
and
the
other
nutritious
gramma
or
grasses
of
our
common
pasture
lands
no
seed
has
been
sown
in
these
localities
and
none
could
have
been
found
had
every
square
inch
of
the
surface
soil
been
examined
by
the
most
powerful
microscope
the
white
clover
and
these
nutritious
grasses
make
their
appearance
on
these
prairies
just
as
the
first
sprig
of
vegetation
did
on
the
earth
not
from
seed
but
from
preëxisting
vital
units
or
primordial
germs
implanted
therein
from
the
beginning
and
awaiting
the
necessary
conditions
for
their
development
and
growth
the
bird
theory
is
the
one
almost
universally
relied
upon
for
the
explanation
of
these
phenomena
where
the
seeds
distributed
or
supposed
to
be
distributed
are
not
winged
but
we
are
satisfied
that
birds
perform
no
such
important
office
in
the
matter
of
as
is
generally
attributed
to
them
we
have
examined
during
the
past
two
seasons
a
large
number
of
and
find
our
previous
impressions
respecting
them
fully
verified
with
all
the
more
delicate
seeds
those
of
our
common
field
grasses
and
weeds
the
chances
are
a
thousand
to
one
that
none
of
them
will
ever
pass
the
cloaca
of
the
bird
eating
them
in
any
condition
to
germinate
all
birds
are
also
and
the
pebbles
and
gravel
they
eat
are
mostly
silex
or
the
material
from
which
our
best
buhrstones
are
made
these
pass
into
the
gizzard
or
pyloric
division
of
the
bird
stomach
where
they
are
utilized
the
same
as
we
utilize
our
buhrstones
the
gizzard
has
sharply
corrugated
interior
walls
extremely
thick
and
muscular
which
involuntarily
contract
and
expand
giving
the
bird
a
tremendous
grinding
power
over
his
food
considering
the
size
of
his
grinding
apparatus
the
seeds
all
the
seeds
in
fact
he
eats
pass
at
once
into
his
crop
or
the
natural
hopper
to
his
gristmill
where
they
undergo
a
moistening
or
macerating
process
previous
to
being
ground
into
the
finest
pulp
in
the
gizzard
as
a
general
rule
all
the
seeds
a
bird
eats
are
ground
into
this
pulpy
state
before
they
pass
into
the
intestinal
canal
extending
from
the
gizzard
to
the
cloaca
the
hard
and
highly
elastic
outer
coating
of
most
small
seeds
may
be
measurably
preserved
in
its
passage
through
the
gizzard
and
resuming
its
oval
shape
in
the
thinner
pulpy
mass
contained
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
intestine
present
the
appearance
of
seed
in
the
cloacal
discharges
and
thus
deceive
the
casual
observer
but
the
use
of
a
spatula
and
a
small
piece
of
polished
stone
slab
will
show
that
the
entire
discharge
is
excrementitious
matter
with
the
single
exception
of
this
silicious
coating
of
the
seeds
the
case
is
different
however
with
the
birds
the
fruits
they
consume
are
retained
but
a
comparatively
short
time
in
the
crop
pass
hurriedly
through
the
gizzard
and
no
doubt
carry
along
with
them
some
of
the
smaller
seeds
of
berries
and
now
and
then
the
pit
of
a
cherry
or
small
plum
the
gizzard
in
these
cases
is
simply
gorged
with
the
pulp
and
juices
of
the
fruit
its
muscular
action
more
or
less
relaxed
and
some
of
the
seeds
consequently
escape
the
grinding
process
they
would
otherwise
undergo
and
yet
we
are
satisfied
that
a
majority
of
these
seeds
even
are
more
or
less
thoroughly
triturated
by
a
healthy
bird
this
would
certainly
be
the
case
if
they
were
retained
for
any
length
of
time
in
the
pyloric
division
of
the
bird
stomach
all
birds
have
gizzards
but
their
grinding
capacity
depends
very
much
on
the
character
of
the
food
they
eat
birds
of
prey
and
others
subsisting
mostly
or
entirely
on
animal
food
have
thin
membranous
and
comparatively
flabby
gizzards
while
those
living
on
hard
grains
and
seeds
have
extremely
thick
powerful
and
muscular
ones
those
capable
of
crushing
up
and
thoroughly
triturating
all
the
food
they
take
into
their
crops
these
gizzards
are
nature
gristmills
and
they
grind
exceedingly
fine
if
any
seed
escapes
it
is
because
the
mill
has
been
flooded
by
the
bird
and
not
because
of
any
defect
in
the
grinding
apparatus
these
birds
are
not
therefore
natural
sowers
of
seeds
as
professor
marsh
and
some
others
claim
but
are
at
most
only
accidental
or
nature
never
designed
that
they
should
do
anything
more
than
consume
the
food
they
eat
or
submit
it
to
the
proper
action
of
their
digestive
organs
it
might
as
well
be
claimed
that
the
secretary
bird
is
a
natural
sower
of
serpents
as
that
many
of
the
birds
are
the
natural
sowers
of
seeds
the
theory
is
too
foraminated
too
full
of
loopholes
and
unsatisfactory
conditions
to
be
accepted
as
an
explanation
of
the
more
general
phenomena
presented
the
quadrupeds
are
relatively
far
better
sowers
of
seeds
than
the
birds
for
they
eat
fruit
without
sending
their
grists
to
mill
dwight
rejected
the
transportation
theory
as
early
as
and
professor
marsh
gives
any
number
of
cases
where
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
abandon
it
and
yet
some
of
our
ablest
writers
publishing
works
of
quite
recent
date
adhere
to
it
as
the
only
theory
that
accounts
for
all
the
phenomena
presented
professor
george
thurber
in
speaking
of
the
dissemination
of
seeds
finds
other
agencies
therefor
than
winds
birds
quadrupeds
such
as
we
have
already
named
for
instance
he
claims
that
rivers
ocean
currents
mountain
torrents
and
even
wars
contribute
largely
towards
their
dispersion
and
dissemination
throughout
different
parts
of
the
earth
all
this
may
be
true
to
a
limited
extent
but
none
of
these
enumerated
agencies
will
account
for
more
than
a
very
few
of
the
many
facts
we
have
given
and
many
others
that
might
be
given
if
our
limits
permitted
among
the
instances
where
wars
have
had
or
are
claimed
to
have
had
an
important
agency
in
the
distribution
of
seeds
throughout
an
invaded
country
he
mentions
the
fact
that
after
our
late
civil
war
a
little
leguminous
plant
sprang
up
all
over
the
southern
states
and
adds
that
it
was
not
known
how
it
came
or
where
from
but
its
native
country
is
japan
in
some
parts
of
the
south
it
is
known
as
japan
clover
and
is
highly
valued
as
a
forage
plant
but
the
war
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
appearance
of
this
plant
all
over
the
southern
states
than
the
changes
of
the
moon
or
the
phenomenal
man
therein
the
plant
had
been
noticed
in
certain
localities
in
the
south
before
the
war
but
the
circumstance
of
its
very
general
appearance
throughout
a
large
area
of
that
section
of
country
was
not
particularly
noticed
until
the
confederate
troops
began
to
move
from
one
southern
state
to
another
when
finding
it
a
valuable
forage
plant
they
naturally
enough
regarded
it
as
a
providential
dispensation
especially
in
those
sections
where
other
forage
plants
and
nutritious
gramma
were
not
abundant
but
this
plant
would
have
made
its
appearance
just
the
same
had
the
war
never
been
thought
of
as
a
possible
remedy
for
aggressive
legislation
however
real
or
imaginary
it
may
have
been
it
can
be
easily
accounted
for
however
on
the
theory
we
have
suggested
that
of
the
germinal
principle
of
life
implanted
in
the
earth
as
the
bible
genesis
indubitably
indicates
the
plant
in
question
has
long
been
a
native
of
japan
which
lies
in
the
same
warm
temperate
zone
as
the
southern
states
the
same
general
hygrometric
and
thermometric
conditions
prevail
throughout
the
two
countries
or
sections
of
country
these
added
to
the
necessary
telluric
conditions
give
the
required
moisture
heat
and
for
the
development
of
the
japan
clover
in
the
south
the
same
as
it
was
originally
developed
in
its
native
country
and
it
is
just
as
much
native
to
the
south
now
as
it
was
hundreds
or
thousand
of
years
ago
to
japan
it
did
not
come
from
seeds
scattered
by
war
or
any
other
imaginable
agency
of
man
but
from
the
indestructible
vital
units
or
germs
implanted
in
the
earth
itself
had
the
plant
appeared
in
any
one
locality
or
even
in
half
a
dozen
separate
localities
in
the
south
it
might
possibly
have
been
accounted
for
on
the
theory
of
professor
thurber
but
its
simultaneous
appearance
over
all
the
southern
states
as
he
puts
it
absolutely
negatives
any
such
theory
neither
winds
river
or
ocean
currents
casual
mountain
torrents
birds
quadrupeds
war
or
even
man
himself
could
have
effected
this
sudden
and
wide
distribution
of
the
plant
in
question
it
came
as
did
all
other
in
the
first
instance
from
geographical
conditions
those
favoring
the
development
of
primordial
germs
just
as
the
different
organic
infusions
experimentally
prepared
by
the
physiologist
produce
their
respective
forms
of
infusorial
life
each
distinctive
form
depending
on
the
chemical
conditions
of
the
infusion
at
the
time
the
microscopic
examination
is
made
change
the
conditions
or
defer
the
examination
until
the
conditions
themselves
are
changed
and
other
and
different
forms
of
life
will
make
their
appearance
in
harmony
with
the
physiological
law
we
have
named
this
wonderful
play
of
the
vital
forces
of
nature
is
no
less
dependant
on
conditions
on
the
necessary
plasma
chemically
balanced
soils
organic
solutions
than
the
alleged
dynamical
aggregates
plastide
particles
or
highly
differentiated
insisted
upon
by
the
physicists
in
their
materialistic
theories
of
life
these
physicists
make
even
the
slightest
change
in
developmental
phases
whether
statical
as
in
the
case
of
crystals
or
dynamical
as
in
the
case
of
living
organisms
to
depend
on
physical
conditions
those
aiding
and
abetting
what
they
call
the
molecular
play
of
physical
forces
but
with
their
theory
that
matter
and
motion
are
the
only
indestructible
elements
in
the
universe
what
molecular
play
can
be
attributed
to
matter
but
that
which
is
derived
from
motion
or
some
one
of
its
alleged
correlates
we
can
only
imagine
two
sorts
of
motion
as
possible
metaphysical
conceptions
in
connection
with
matter
motion
or
that
relating
to
matter
moving
in
mass
and
motion
or
that
relating
to
the
movements
of
matter
in
its
unaggregated
form
or
as
confined
to
molecules
but
motion
itself
is
not
an
absolute
entity
it
is
not
so
much
even
as
a
collocating
or
placing
force
of
matter
itself
it
is
at
best
only
a
mechanical
impulse
imparted
by
one
moving
body
to
another
or
more
accurately
speaking
a
continuous
change
of
place
in
a
moving
body
in
other
words
it
is
simply
a
or
of
action
and
stands
in
about
the
same
relation
to
matter
as
does
to
a
living
plant
or
tree
independently
of
matter
it
has
no
existence
either
objectively
or
subjectively
or
even
as
a
metaphysical
conception
to
allege
its
indestructibility
as
the
physicists
do
is
simply
to
predicate
an
additional
property
of
indestructible
matter
we
may
call
it
force
something
that
constantly
expends
itself
in
a
moving
body
but
it
is
utterly
incapable
of
definition
or
of
conception
even
except
as
it
stands
related
to
such
moving
body
all
the
marvellous
correlates
of
motion
therefore
producing
such
wonderful
effects
upon
matter
in
both
its
molar
and
molecular
states
or
conditions
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
vague
and
inconclusive
inductions
derived
from
premises
having
at
best
nothing
but
a
relative
existence
in
a
universe
of
moving
matter
it
would
be
decidedly
better
to
agree
with
haeckel
that
matter
is
the
only
actual
existence
than
to
predicate
of
matter
a
and
wholly
inexplicable
somewhat
whereon
to
base
a
purely
physical
hypothesis
of
life
but
let
us
return
from
this
slight
digression
the
beautiful
and
purely
local
fern
growing
in
the
pine
barrens
of
new
jersey
affords
quite
as
conclusive
proof
of
the
correctness
of
the
bible
genesis
of
life
as
the
phenomenal
appearance
of
japan
clover
in
the
south
it
was
at
one
time
supposed
that
this
most
delicate
and
beautiful
of
all
our
ferns
was
peculiar
to
the
new
jersey
pine
barrens
but
it
has
been
ascertained
that
it
grows
quite
as
abundantly
in
similar
barrens
in
new
zealand
which
are
in
the
south
temperate
zone
at
about
the
same
latitude
south
that
these
pine
barrens
of
new
jersey
occupy
in
the
temperate
zone
north
so
that
at
whatever
period
this
fern
originally
made
its
appearance
in
either
locality
it
unquestionably
found
the
exact
thermometric
hygrometric
telluric
and
other
conditions
necessary
for
the
development
of
its
vital
germs
take
any
accurate
or
even
chart
of
plant
distribution
on
the
earth
surface
and
it
will
be
found
that
everywhere
under
the
same
favoring
conditions
plants
of
the
same
genera
and
species
make
their
appearance
independently
of
any
known
processes
of
dissemination
in
the
case
of
seeds
the
distribution
is
not
one
of
seeds
but
rather
of
geographical
conditions
thermometric
hygrometric
telluric
and
possibly
chemical
and
this
is
true
of
all
vegetation
whether
growing
in
the
same
plant
zones
in
high
latitudes
at
high
altitudes
or
under
one
degree
of
temperature
and
moisture
or
another
whenever
the
telluric
conditions
are
the
same
or
similar
in
the
respective
localities
named
and
the
temperature
and
moisture
correspond
the
necessary
plant
distribution
follows
in
obedience
to
the
divine
mandate
let
the
earth
bring
forth
this
is
the
one
uniform
law
that
governs
everywhere
and
the
only
one
that
accounts
for
all
the
diversified
manifestations
of
now
as
heretofore
taking
place
upon
our
globe
and
the
same
is
measurably
true
of
animal
life
it
accounts
for
the
appearance
of
every
form
of
life
in
organic
infusions
for
in
the
blood
in
the
tissues
plastide
particles
morphological
cells
and
every
other
vital
manifestation
from
the
smallest
conceivable
unit
of
life
in
protaplasmic
matter
to
the
lordliest
and
most
defiant
forest
oak
that
ever
bared
its
arms
to
the
storms
and
tempests
of
centuries
a
purely
materialistic
science
may
perk
its
head
with
an
air
of
affected
incredulity
and
superciliously
turn
aside
from
this
hypothesis
because
it
does
not
shock
our
veneration
for
the
sacred
scriptures
but
let
its
special
advocates
advance
some
more
consistent
and
rational
than
that
of
molecular
machinery
worked
by
molecular
force
or
content
themselves
with
gull
in
confessing
that
they
are
unable
to
draw
the
first
line
between
living
matter
and
dead
matter
as
they
absurdly
use
these
terms
it
is
conceded
that
much
extravagant
speculation
has
been
wasted
upon
this
question
of
the
distribution
of
seeds
the
ambition
of
each
new
writer
has
seemingly
been
to
hit
upon
some
new
theory
of
distribution
the
bird
theory
is
a
failure
as
we
have
shown
nor
do
they
invariably
fly
due
east
or
west
so
as
to
supply
the
several
climatic
zones
with
their
respective
vegetations
the
same
is
true
of
the
squirrel
theory
for
this
nimble
little
rodent
is
as
likely
to
head
north
or
south
as
to
follow
the
course
of
the
sun
the
wind
theory
is
subject
to
too
many
shifts
and
changes
to
be
accounted
a
reliable
agency
the
theories
are
still
less
satisfactory
since
rivers
flow
in
diverse
directions
and
ocean
currents
bear
with
safety
only
their
own
aquatic
plants
the
theory
is
hardly
an
accredited
agency
and
the
war
theory
is
attended
with
too
much
destruction
of
life
to
be
safely
relied
on
as
conserving
the
vital
forces
of
nature
the
climatic
zones
and
high
and
low
altitudes
have
still
to
be
consulted
to
get
at
the
real
causes
of
distribution
or
such
as
conclusively
satisfy
the
scientific
mind
for
no
single
plant
is
really
a
cosmopolite
they
are
simply
the
habitats
of
their
own
separate
zones
except
as
high
altitudes
are
reached
and
climatic
and
other
conditions
favor
the
appearance
of
such
vegetation
as
belongs
to
other
plant
zones
if
we
would
find
the
more
common
plants
and
weeds
of
new
england
in
north
carolina
or
tennessee
we
must
go
into
the
mountainous
regions
of
those
states
at
an
altitude
which
compensates
for
the
difference
in
latitude
and
where
the
influencing
conditions
of
are
essentially
the
same
in
such
localities
we
shall
find
the
same
household
plants
garden
weeds
and
general
vegetation
as
in
higher
northern
latitudes
not
because
their
seeds
have
been
borne
thither
from
new
england
or
elsewhere
but
because
the
same
climatic
telluric
and
other
conditions
prevail
as
in
the
more
northern
localities
and
these
conditions
are
what
determine
the
development
and
growth
of
local
vegetations
and
so
of
the
alpine
firs
grasses
harebells
lichens
mosses
etc
their
seeds
have
not
been
scattered
by
any
known
agencies
over
intervening
regions
for
thousands
of
miles
or
more
in
order
to
find
lodgment
on
these
lofty
mountain
cones
but
conditions
being
the
same
the
same
vegetable
growths
appear
this
is
nature
method
of
propagating
vital
units
and
diversifying
geographical
conditions
everywhere
determining
the
proper
distribution
but
if
nature
is
so
prolific
of
vital
resources
in
the
propagation
of
what
need
has
she
of
natural
seeds
we
anticipate
this
inquiry
only
to
answer
it
for
we
recognize
it
as
a
legitimate
one
in
this
connection
our
answer
is
that
the
seeds
are
given
for
the
use
of
man
that
he
may
control
and
utilize
vegetation
and
not
have
to
depend
on
more
or
less
uncertain
conditions
agricultural
chemistry
must
be
carried
to
a
much
higher
degree
of
perfection
than
it
is
likely
to
reach
in
the
next
ten
centuries
at
least
to
determine
whether
any
particular
plat
of
ground
has
been
chemically
balanced
for
the
growth
of
wheat
to
the
exclusion
of
other
cereal
crops
besides
the
process
of
might
be
altogether
too
expensive
to
be
indulged
in
by
judicious
husbandry
these
chemical
conditions
admit
of
too
many
possible
failures
in
balancing
even
the
smallest
patch
of
ground
to
justify
experiments
in
the
direction
named
seeds
also
subserve
the
important
subsidiary
purpose
of
supplying
food
for
many
birds
and
animals
more
or
less
useful
to
man
but
chemistry
has
its
limits
as
to
usefulness
in
all
human
laboratories
as
man
wisdom
is
limited
so
is
his
power
over
the
elementary
forces
of
nature
confined
to
very
narrow
boundaries
it
is
given
to
him
to
search
out
many
inventions
and
to
pry
thus
far
and
no
farther
into
the
secrets
of
nature
or
more
properly
speaking
into
the
secrets
of
god
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
our
theorists
respecting
could
produce
in
their
laboratories
the
exact
plasma
or
plasmic
conditions
of
an
animal
any
animal
in
fact
and
continue
these
conditions
during
the
proper
period
of
gestation
they
produce
life
but
the
most
daring
physicist
would
stand
aghast
at
the
bare
proposal
of
such
an
experiment
neither
his
knowledge
of
chemistry
nor
the
present
uncertain
value
attaching
to
molecular
machinery
would
justify
him
for
a
moment
in
entering
upon
such
a
purely
tentative
and
empirical
an
undertaking
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
assume
that
the
same
law
of
vital
force
governs
in
the
appearance
and
geographical
distribution
of
as
universally
obtains
in
the
higher
and
more
complex
vegetal
growths
and
although
it
may
be
difficult
in
some
instances
to
draw
the
precise
line
between
certain
low
mycological
forms
and
the
amoeboid
and
some
other
primitive
manifestations
of
animal
life
yet
all
vegetable
physiologists
agree
in
assigning
a
purely
vegetable
origin
to
all
the
primary
groups
of
fungi
their
general
cellular
character
determining
their
proper
place
in
classification
and
in
all
their
extended
family
groups
pervading
nature
as
widely
as
animal
and
vegetable
life
we
find
that
uniform
chemical
and
other
conditions
produce
uniform
mycological
results
spores
are
no
more
necessary
for
their
appearance
in
the
first
instance
than
acorns
are
essential
to
the
appearance
of
an
oak
forest
when
it
succeeds
the
pine
wherever
the
necessary
conditions
of
moisture
and
heat
are
found
to
obtain
in
connection
with
decayed
or
decaying
substances
the
particular
form
of
fungus
indicated
thereby
whether
parasitic
or
will
make
its
appearance
continuously
damp
walls
or
will
produce
them
in
specific
variety
not
because
their
invisible
spores
are
flying
about
in
the
atmosphere
to
find
appropriate
lodgment
but
because
the
necessary
conditions
obtain
for
their
manifestation
or
for
the
development
of
their
vital
units
those
everywhere
diffused
and
ready
to
burgeon
forth
from
the
proper
matrix
or
from
certain
nutrient
conditions
to
be
met
with
in
all
vegetable
substances
after
the
process
of
decay
has
commenced
some
orders
appear
only
in
a
single
matrix
but
the
greater
part
of
them
flourish
on
different
decaying
substances
cooke
in
speaking
of
fungi
and
especially
of
moulds
says
it
would
be
far
more
difficult
to
mention
substances
on
which
they
are
never
developed
than
to
indicate
where
they
have
been
found
the
parasitic
fungi
however
generally
confine
themselves
to
certain
special
plants
and
rarely
to
any
other
it
is
only
the
condition
of
these
special
plants
when
affected
by
decay
that
seems
favorable
for
their
development
not
because
their
spores
assuming
that
all
fungi
come
from
spores
possess
the
intelligence
to
fly
about
and
hunt
up
the
proper
nutrient
matter
on
which
to
subsist
during
their
developmental
progress
from
specific
spores
into
genetic
forms
of
life
the
rust
or
blight
of
grain
is
not
the
cause
therefore
but
rather
the
result
of
the
common
disease
known
as
blight
without
some
excess
or
deficiency
of
absorption
and
elaboration
in
the
growth
of
grain
or
plants
something
essentially
disturbing
their
normal
and
harmonious
processes
of
development
no
mycological
forms
would
appear
on
their
stems
or
roots
nor
would
they
develop
themselves
on
their
fading
leaves
or
congested
and
decaying
fruit
to
say
that
there
is
any
intelligent
preference
in
these
fungi
the
different
species
of
for
instance
for
disgusting
offal
over
decaying
fruit
bread
paste
preserves
is
to
predicate
a
higher
degree
of
intelligence
of
fungus
spores
than
of
the
average
brute
creation
with
all
its
wonderful
instincts
for
guidance
we
might
refer
to
other
classes
of
fungi
developing
themselves
in
the
testa
of
hard
seeds
and
in
the
interior
of
acorns
sweet
chestnuts
those
in
which
there
is
no
discoverable
external
opening
by
the
aid
of
the
microscope
to
show
the
absolute
absurdity
of
the
theory
that
the
spores
of
fungi
including
the
and
other
autonomous
moulds
go
madly
foraging
about
the
country
in
pursuit
of
decaying
cocoanuts
apples
pears
plums
oranges
and
even
committing
their
depredations
on
hermetically
canned
fruits
the
concealed
honeycomb
of
beehives
the
pupa
of
moths
and
whatever
else
they
may
intelligently
select
as
a
desirable
matrix
or
habitat
no
such
theory
as
this
will
stand
the
test
of
thorough
research
and
investigation
in
any
mycological
direction
fungi
everywhere
make
their
initial
appearance
in
the
conditions
of
decay
as
plants
and
trees
originally
make
theirs
in
the
environing
conditions
of
vital
manifestation
that
our
atmosphere
the
omnipotens
of
virgil
descending
into
the
bosom
of
his
joyous
spouse
the
earth
in
fructifying
showers
and
great
himself
mingling
with
her
great
body
for
the
development
of
all
things
of
life
should
be
so
immeasurably
thronged
with
fungi
that
myriads
of
their
spores
might
dance
without
jostling
on
the
point
of
a
cambric
needle
is
infinitely
more
fanciful
than
the
conceptions
of
the
poet
in
personifying
the
atmosphere
as
father
æther
and
the
earth
as
his
joyous
spouse
but
life
with
its
pardlike
spirit
beautiful
and
swift
has
reached
its
highest
conceptions
in
the
mind
of
the
poet
not
in
the
speculations
of
the
scientist
what
a
mingled
yarn
spun
from
yet
invisible
threads
is
it
in
the
creative
mind
of
a
shakespeare
and
how
it
looms
up
into
a
dome
of
glass
staining
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
under
the
magic
touch
of
a
shelley
and
yet
how
is
it
dwarfed
down
to
a
contemptible
piece
of
molecular
machinery
by
the
scientist
one
so
utterly
contemptible
in
its
manifestations
that
it
is
ordered
to
take
a
back
seat
in
this
universe
of
matter
and
motion
cooke
in
his
handbook
of
british
fungi
virtually
concedes
that
the
spores
of
the
large
as
well
as
those
of
mushrooms
truffles
and
other
edible
fungi
those
with
whose
methods
of
propagation
man
is
best
acquainted
may
be
produced
artificially
but
the
process
by
which
their
production
is
thus
effected
is
more
properly
a
natural
than
an
artificial
one
in
speaking
of
he
says
quoting
from
broome
that
whenever
a
plantation
of
beech
or
beech
and
fir
is
made
in
the
chalky
districts
of
salisbury
plain
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
truffles
are
produced
and
that
the
plantations
continue
productive
for
a
period
of
from
ten
to
fifteen
years
after
which
they
cease
to
be
so
no
truffle
spores
were
planted
in
these
cases
but
the
conditions
of
the
soil
interlaced
by
the
roots
and
shaded
by
the
branches
of
the
young
beech
trees
or
the
beech
and
fir
became
favorable
for
the
development
of
truffle
germs
and
they
made
their
appearance
just
as
mushrooms
do
in
caves
and
other
places
where
artificial
beds
are
made
and
chemically
balanced
for
their
development
and
growth
and
the
reason
why
they
disappeared
after
a
period
of
ten
or
fifteen
years
was
simply
because
the
proper
nutriment
of
the
soil
was
exhausted
and
not
in
consequence
of
its
being
too
deeply
shaded
by
the
growing
trees
one
uniform
rule
would
seem
to
govern
in
the
culture
of
this
fungus
wherever
the
necessary
environing
conditions
obtain
they
and
wherever
these
conditions
fail
they
notwithstanding
the
most
persistent
efforts
to
save
them
by
watering
the
soil
with
fresh
infusions
of
the
plant
in
proof
of
this
one
form
of
truffle
appears
under
beech
trees
another
form
under
oak
trees
and
still
a
third
form
under
oaks
and
white
poplars
showing
that
so
slight
a
change
in
soil
conditions
as
that
resulting
from
the
presence
of
poplars
among
oaks
produces
a
very
material
change
in
the
character
of
the
fungus
one
amounting
to
a
specific
difference
in
variety
the
process
of
artificially
producing
mushroom
spores
is
a
very
simple
one
and
may
be
easily
followed
you
have
only
to
collect
a
quantity
of
mingle
with
them
some
common
road
sand
place
them
under
cover
see
that
they
are
well
beaten
down
in
order
to
prevent
turning
them
occasionally
for
the
same
purpose
and
in
due
time
they
will
generate
sufficient
spores
for
a
dozen
mushroom
beds
of
the
ordinary
size
the
reason
for
their
appearance
is
the
same
as
that
governing
truffle
spores
they
come
whenever
conditions
favor
that
is
whenever
the
soil
is
chemically
balanced
for
their
development
and
growth
in
other
words
they
come
because
it
is
just
as
impossible
for
them
not
to
come
in
their
proper
environing
conditions
as
it
is
for
the
earth
in
its
present
cosmical
relations
not
to
respond
to
its
axial
rotation
let
the
earth
bring
forth
is
just
as
much
an
outspoken
law
of
nature
and
one
as
inexorably
obeyed
as
that
unerring
force
of
gravity
which
led
leverrier
in
the
faith
of
his
inductions
to
indicate
the
precise
point
in
the
heavens
where
the
planet
now
bearing
his
name
might
be
seen
by
the
required
telescope
cooke
quoting
cuthill
directions
for
producing
mushroom
spores
says
these
little
collections
of
and
road
sand
if
kept
dry
in
shed
hole
or
corner
under
cover
will
in
a
short
time
generate
plenty
of
spawn
and
will
be
ready
to
spread
on
the
surface
of
the
bed
in
early
autumn
the
collections
should
of
course
be
made
in
the
early
summer
but
it
is
no
part
of
our
object
to
indicate
in
this
connection
the
process
of
truffle
or
mushroom
culture
we
merely
refer
to
the
methods
to
show
that
the
vital
units
or
germinal
principles
of
life
in
the
case
of
fungi
are
just
as
dependent
on
conditions
for
their
development
as
were
the
primordial
germs
of
the
gigantic
cryptogams
of
the
carboniferous
era
these
primordial
germs
or
the
of
the
bible
genesis
must
have
preceded
the
first
fungous
growth
as
they
preceded
the
first
cryptogam
gasparin
in
his
report
on
the
production
of
truffles
made
to
the
great
paris
exposition
of
refers
to
the
natural
at
vaucluse
where
the
common
oak
produces
truffles
like
the
evergreen
oak
although
in
other
localities
owing
no
doubt
to
the
different
conditions
of
the
soil
those
gathered
at
the
base
of
the
one
species
of
oak
differ
very
materially
from
those
gathered
at
the
base
of
the
other
all
these
experimental
results
and
many
others
we
might
give
in
connection
with
the
culture
of
edible
fungi
point
to
the
conditions
of
the
soil
produced
by
natural
rather
than
artificial
means
as
for
the
propagation
of
fungus
spores
as
well
as
their
development
into
plants
the
cultivation
of
other
and
minuter
fungi
for
scientific
purposes
need
not
be
referred
to
in
this
connection
the
same
general
observations
will
be
found
to
apply
in
the
case
of
all
the
experiments
tried
although
some
very
curious
and
remarkable
modifications
occur
where
pseudospores
are
to
be
found
in
the
micelium
of
different
plants
nearly
all
these
fungi
have
their
own
parasites
originating
undoubtedly
in
the
diseased
conditions
of
the
plant
from
which
they
derive
their
nutriment
indeed
all
fungi
whether
parasitic
or
have
their
origin
more
or
less
definitely
occurring
in
decay
it
is
no
more
true
that
death
is
a
necessity
of
life
than
that
life
is
an
equal
necessity
of
death
as
out
of
the
dead
past
springs
the
eternally
living
present
so
from
the
muddy
vesture
of
decay
spring
all
the
marvellous
powers
of
reproduction
with
which
nature
was
endowed
from
the
beginning
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
longer
on
the
spores
of
fungi
as
with
the
seeds
of
plants
and
trees
these
spores
never
had
an
existence
and
never
could
have
had
one
before
the
first
independent
fungus
appeared
to
produce
them
the
fungus
before
the
spore
is
the
inevitable
induction
no
distinction
between
necessary
and
contingent
truth
can
ever
take
a
stronger
hold
than
this
on
the
human
mind
whence
then
the
fungus
or
whence
rather
all
those
colonies
families
orders
divisions
and
countless
distinct
individuals
extant
everywhere
in
the
mycological
world
the
answer
we
shall
give
will
be
anticipated
from
what
we
have
already
so
confidently
affirmed
life
comes
from
life
as
spirit
comes
from
god
and
when
the
spirit
of
god
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
depths
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
at
whatever
stage
in
the
progress
of
our
planet
from
its
original
form
to
its
present
condition
of
life
that
transcendent
event
occurred
as
we
worship
her
received
her
first
baptism
of
life
and
her
solemn
consecration
as
the
vicar
of
god
no
wonder
then
that
at
that
ecstatic
moment
when
the
ineffably
bright
mantle
fringed
with
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
fell
upon
her
the
morning
stars
sang
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
and
nature
has
been
true
to
both
her
baptism
and
her
consecration
she
claims
no
worship
no
adoration
no
idolatrous
homage
from
man
but
continually
sends
up
her
eternal
chant
and
choral
anthem
of
praise
to
the
great
giver
of
life
every
flower

chapter
plant
migration
and
interglacial
periods
among
the
leading
propositions
laid
down
by
arthur
renfrey
in
the
able
article
prepared
by
him
for
the
physical
atlas
of
natural
phenomena
by
alexander
keith
johnston
edinburg
edition
on
the
geographical
distribution
of
the
most
important
plants
yielding
food
are
the
following
the
primary
condition
of
the
existence
of
any
species
of
plant
is
its
absolute
creation
of
which
we
know
nothing
but
we
assume
each
species
to
have
been
but
once
in
time
and
in
and
that
its
present
diffusion
is
the
result
of
its
own
law
of
reproduction
under
the
favorable
or
restrictive
influences
of
laws
external
to
it
the
most
important
of
external
laws
are
those
relating
to
climate
since
species
can
flourish
only
within
narrower
or
wider
but
always
fixed
limits
of
temperature
humidity
the
climate
depends
primarily
on
latitude
since
this
indicates
distance
from
the
source
of
heat
and
the
degree
of
obliquity
of
the
heating
rays
there
are
other
governing
conditions
of
course
such
as
the
average
distance
from
the
equator
the
elevation
above
the
sea
level
in
the
various
mountain
systems
of
vegetation
including
the
hygrometric
thermometric
telluric
and
other
conditions
of
the
several
localities
in
which
the
different
species
of
vegetation
make
their
appearance
but
why
should
this
distinguished
naturalist
insist
upon
the
specific
creation
of
either
plants
or
animals
no
scientific
work
of
any
paramount
value
confines
the
creative
power
of
the
universe
to
such
narrow
and
restricted
limits
nor
is
there
a
particle
of
evidence
to
be
drawn
from
the
bible
that
either
plants
or
animals
primarily
originated
in
pairs
let
the
earth
bring
forth
is
a
command
without
limitation
or
restriction
as
to
time
place
or
number
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
myriads
of
living
forms
swarmed
everywhere
at
first
as
now
in
nature
the
idea
as
expressed
by
renfrey
that
they
were
specifically
created
at
one
time
and
place
only
whether
in
pairs
tens
twenties
or
hundreds
is
neither
a
rational
one
nor
has
it
any
or
scientific
authority
on
which
to
stand
take
for
instance
an
directly
in
point
when
the
salt
wells
were
first
bored
at
syracuse
and
the
salt
water
was
suffered
to
flow
in
waste
over
the
low
grounds
about
the
the
small
saline
plants
peculiar
to
in
the
warm
temperate
zone
made
their
appearance
not
in
pairs
tens
or
hundreds
but
in
thousands
rather
and
have
nourished
there
ever
since
they
came
because
conditions
favored
because
a
had
been
artificially
produced
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
the
sea
coast
this
is
only
one
of
a
large
number
of
cases
more
than
we
have
room
to
specify
in
this
connection
showing
that
wherever
man
artificially
or
otherwise
produces
the
necessary
conditions
of
nature
responds
to
the
germinal
law
precisely
as
she
did
millions
of
years
ago
when
the
first
favored
the
appearance
of
these
saline
plants
such
as
grow
under
no
other
conditions
or
circumstances
but
this
idea
of
plants
coming
primarily
from
a
single
pair
of
progenitors
and
each
primordial
pair
branching
off
into
diversified
offspring
as
in
the
case
of
the
cabbage
assumed
to
be
the
original
ancestor
of
all
the
turnips
and
may
be
an
article
of
botanical
faith
but
never
of
experimental
proof
non
sunt
multiplicanda
præter
is
an
old
and
maxim
applicable
alike
to
the
countless
myriads
of
living
organisms
as
to
the
innumerable
crystalline
forms
to
be
found
everywhere
in
nature
nothing
is
produced
without
the
necessary
conditions
on
which
its
production
depends
necessity
in
its
primitive
signification
is
a
term
of
the
very
widest
meaning
and
most
universal
application
it
applies
as
well
to
the
course
of
nature
as
to
the
course
of
human
events
to
the
laws
of
vegetable
and
animal
growth
as
to
the
inevitable
march
and
order
of
celestial
movements
as
applied
to
any
form
of
it
implies
a
law
of
development
and
growth
as
well
as
the
physiological
conditions
without
which
vital
manifestations
are
impossible
for
law
in
a
physiological
sense
is
that
mode
of
vital
action
by
which
effects
are
invariably
and
inevitably
produced
and
this
law
is
just
as
dependent
on
necessary
vital
conditions
as
vital
manifestations
are
dependent
on
a
physiological
law
there
must
always
be
this
reciprocal
dependence
and
relationship
between
conditioning
causes
and
effects
whenever
and
wherever
the
necessary
vital
conditions
exist
the
physiological
law
takes
effect
and
the
requisite
vital
manifestation
is
witnessed
and
this
is
no
doubt
as
true
of
animal
as
of
vegetable
life
the
earth
surface
has
been
divided
into
eight
separate
zones
each
of
which
is
distinguished
by
its
peculiar
or
characteristic
fauna
and
flora
their
order
measured
from
the
geographical
equator
is
as
follows
the
equatorial
zone
extending
from
to
tropical
warm
temperate
cold
arctic
polar
these
several
zones
become
sixteen
in
number
when
considered
with
reference
to
both
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
and
a
like
division
of
isothermals
is
made
in
the
case
of
all
our
mountain
systems
extending
in
both
directions
from
the
equator
in
ascending
our
equatorial
tropical
and
mountains
we
find
of
course
at
their
several
bases
the
temperature
of
the
zones
in
which
they
respectively
lie
from
two
thousand
to
three
thousand
feet
we
reach
the
next
higher
zone
and
so
on
at
about
the
same
ratio
of
altitude
until
we
ascend
to
the
polar
zone
or
the
line
of
perpetual
ice
and
snow
the
peak
of
teneriffe
for
instance
lies
in
the
zone
but
at
the
elevation
named
we
meet
with
the
vegetation
which
characterizes
the
warm
temperate
zone
and
this
holds
true
of
all
our
mountain
systems
in
all
latitudes
and
at
all
altitudes
in
all
parts
of
the
globe
they
all
present
the
same
or
strikingly
similar
characteristics
in
plant
life
with
such
variations
and
modifications
only
as
might
be
accounted
for
were
all
the
influencing
conditions
and
surrounding
circumstances
modifying
geographical
distribution
known
to
us
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
regions
in
which
vegetation
flourishes
this
rule
with
slight
exceptions
only
will
be
found
to
obtain
and
it
is
in
this
direction
that
the
observations
of
the
scientific
as
well
as
practical
botanist
should
hereafter
be
extended
humboldt
noticed
this
characteristic
feature
of
the
earth
vegetation
quite
early
in
his
explorations
and
accordingly
divided
the
tropical
mountains
as
the
earth
surface
was
then
divided
into
three
separate
zones
the
tropical
the
temperate
and
the
frigid
but
a
closer
classification
now
distinguishes
them
into
the
same
number
of
zones
as
are
marked
in
approximate
isotherms
on
the
earth
surface
renfrey
gives
us
further
statistics
of
great
value
respecting
these
several
plant
zones
of
the
globe
all
of
which
fit
so
admirably
into
our
theory
of
that
we
can
hardly
see
how
the
most
prejudiced
mind
can
resist
the
force
of
its
application
among
the
most
important
of
these
statistical
facts
are
tables
giving
the
comparative
in
the
different
plant
zones
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
and
the
classes
of
vegetation
peculiar
to
each
of
them
the
equatorial
zone
for
instance
is
characterized
by
extreme
luxuriance
in
growth
owing
no
doubt
to
the
great
heat
and
abundant
moisture
therein
and
exhibits
a
vegetation
which
is
peculiar
to
itself
and
which
could
only
thrive
under
the
hygrometric
thermometric
telluric
and
other
conditions
of
that
extensive
zone
the
tropical
zones
those
north
and
south
of
the
equator
are
characterized
by
a
more
abundant
and
diversified
underwood
and
while
retaining
some
of
the
equatorial
forms
present
fewer
parasites
and
less
rapid
and
luxuriant
growths
they
contain
many
plants
and
trees
which
are
peculiar
to
their
own
limits
and
these
are
generally
the
hardiest
and
most
abundant
all
equatorial
forms
disappear
in
these
zones
that
is
do
not
pass
into
the
zones
and
these
characteristics
obtain
in
both
the
northern
and
southern
tropical
zones
as
well
as
in
the
mountain
systems
within
the
equatorial
regions
the
zones
while
retaining
some
of
the
more
marked
forms
and
general
features
of
the
tropical
zones
such
as
palms
bananas
exhibit
the
most
striking
characteristics
of
their
own
consisting
of
a
greater
abundance
of
forest
trees
especially
those
having
broad
leathery
and
shining
leaves
like
the
magnolias
the
different
species
of
laurels
and
plants
of
the
myrtle
family
the
tropical
forms
all
disappear
in
these
zones
as
the
equatorial
do
in
the
tropical
zones
the
warm
temperate
zones
exhibit
the
same
disposition
to
retain
some
of
the
hardier
and
more
abundant
forms
that
characterize
the
other
zones
in
respect
to
their
adjoining
isotherms
but
the
trees
and
plants
peculiar
to
this
zone
north
and
the
same
is
no
doubt
true
of
the
corresponding
zone
south
are
more
numerous
and
embrace
a
wider
range
of
deciduous
as
well
as
evergreen
growths
evergreen
shrubs
heaths
cistusses
and
leguminous
plants
are
everywhere
more
abundant
the
marked
characteristic
of
these
zones
is
that
the
trees
plants
and
arborescent
grasses
differ
more
widely
in
their
general
character
as
well
as
run
more
extensively
into
varieties
the
cold
temperate
zones
retain
many
of
the
deciduous
trees
of
the
warm
temperate
but
with
less
conspicuous
blossoms
while
a
stronger
tendency
is
shown
toward
social
conifers
and
the
trunks
of
the
deciduous
trees
are
more
profusely
overrun
with
mosses
lichens
etc
these
zones
are
also
abundant
in
grasses
the
zone
north
largely
retains
its
hold
upon
the
social
conifers
giving
place
northward
on
this
continent
as
well
as
in
europe
and
asia
to
birch
and
alder
alternating
with
willows
where
the
soil
is
sufficiently
moist
green
pastures
are
still
abundant
and
showy
flowering
herbs
abound
during
the
brief
spring
summer
and
autumn
months
the
arctic
zone
retains
few
of
the
forms
and
its
vegetation
generally
corresponds
to
what
we
call
alpine
shrubs
grasses
etc
the
north
polar
zone
shows
few
signs
of
vegetation
and
is
thought
to
be
entirely
devoid
of
shrubs
a
few
small
herbacious
perennials
of
the
most
extreme
dwarf
habit
with
a
few
lichens
and
mosses
constitute
its
entire
vegetation
there
are
some
seeming
exceptions
to
these
general
statements
respecting
but
they
are
hardly
exceptions
when
we
consider
the
elevation
at
which
any
one
species
as
the
birches
for
instance
may
appear
as
they
frequently
do
in
three
several
zones
from
these
facts
gathered
from
the
highest
authorities
and
on
all
hands
what
general
conclusions
if
any
are
to
be
drawn
before
answering
this
inquiry
let
us
proceed
to
state
what
conclusions
been
drawn
according
to
all
the
authorities
we
have
examined
on
the
distribution
of
plant
life
on
the
migration
of
plants
and
animals
on
climate
and
time
as
affecting
the
transference
of
isothermal
and
isochimenal
lines
on
glacial
and
periods
with
one
important
exception
only
the
assumption
maintained
is
substantially
that
of
renfrey
that
each
species
of
plant
and
animal
was
created
but
once
in
time
and
place
and
that
its
present
diffusion
is
the
result
of
its
own
law
of
reproduction
under
the
favorable
or
restrictive
influences
of
laws
external
to
it
in
other
words
they
insist
upon
original
without
definitely
stating
when
or
where
they
occurred
and
that
from
these
centres
both
plants
and
animals
have
migrated
to
all
parts
of
the
globe
where
they
now
appear
even
crossing
the
equatorial
zones
where
they
could
not
live
for
a
single
day
this
migration
theory
they
attempt
to
explain
in
a
way
that
is
altogether
more
ingenious
than
satisfactory
the
important
exception
to
which
we
refer
is
that
of
professor
agassiz
as
reported
by
his
associate
professor
of
harvard
university
asa
gray
in
his
essays
and
reviews
pertaining
to
darwinism
in
this
work
professor
gray
says
of
his
late
distinguished
associate
that
so
far
as
he
was
aware
professor
agassiz
was
the
only
leading
naturalist
who
did
not
take
into
his
very
conception
of
a
species
explicitly
or
by
implication
the
notion
of
a
material
connection
resulting
from
the
descent
of
the
individuals
composing
it
from
a
common
stock
of
a
local
origin
and
professor
gray
adds
this
further
testimony
to
the
closeness
of
his
associate
observations
in
considering
the
very
point
here
under
consideration
agassiz
wholly
eliminates
community
of
descent
from
his
idea
of
species
and
even
conceives
a
species
to
have
been
as
numerous
in
individuals
and
as
widely
spread
over
space
or
as
segregated
in
discontinuous
spaces
from
the
first
to
the
later
periods
and
this
view
is
undoubtedly
the
correct
one
at
all
events
it
entirely
harmonizes
with
the
facts
of
the
biblical
genesis
and
obviates
the
necessity
of
accounting
for
the
appearance
of
the
same
genera
and
species
of
plants
or
animals
in
the
southern
as
in
the
northern
hemispheres
in
fact
their
appearance
in
all
parts
of
the
globe
in
corresponding
isotherms
and
under
similar
conditions
of
moisture
and
wherever
the
hygrometric
thermometric
telluric
and
other
conditions
favor
the
class
of
vegetation
indicated
by
the
presence
of
these
conditions
makes
its
appearance
just
as
the
makes
its
appearance
in
our
warm
temperate
zone
not
from
the
presence
of
seed
but
simply
the
presence
of
conditions
the
of
man
harmonizing
with
the
of
nature
in
the
same
way
the
japan
clover
made
its
appearance
as
professor
thurber
states
all
over
the
southern
states
during
the
late
civil
war
not
from
the
migration
of
plants
but
the
presence
of
natural
conditions
the
numerous
facts
we
have
already
given
and
many
others
that
might
be
arrayed
in
advocacy
of
our
position
taken
in
connection
with
the
general
facts
here
presented
in
regard
to
all
point
directly
to
climatal
and
soil
conditions
as
the
real
cause
of
dissemination
and
not
to
their
migration
from
continent
to
continent
and
across
vast
intervening
seas
and
oceans
as
the
theory
of
professor
gray
and
others
would
require
us
to
believe
take
the
case
of
the
of
the
new
jersey
pine
barrens
to
which
we
have
already
referred
growing
in
similar
barrens
in
new
zealand
and
how
are
we
to
account
for
their
antipodal
appearance
upon
the
globe
professor
thurber
refers
to
this
plant
as
a
purely
local
fern
of
new
jersey
and
says
it
was
for
a
long
time
supposed
to
be
peculiar
to
that
state
until
it
was
ascertained
that
it
grew
in
new
zealand
whether
this
plant
travelled
from
new
zealand
to
new
jersey
or
journeyed
in
the
opposite
direction
none
of
these
gentlemen
can
well
inform
us
professor
agassiz
would
have
said
that
it
might
have
appeared
in
numerous
individuals
in
both
localities
at
the
same
time
or
at
different
times
as
conditions
favored
and
this
would
have
been
an
exact
scientific
statement
no
doubt
of
the
fact
arthur
renfrey
and
those
who
accept
his
scientific
formulæ
must
insist
that
this
most
beautiful
of
all
our
ferns
was
such
a
favorite
child
of
nature
that
she
condescended
to
create
it
in
time
and
place
instead
of
only
it
is
a
poor
rule
they
may
say
that
has
no
exceptions
in
phenomenal
manifestation
professor
gray
may
insist
that
such
a
phenomenon
as
this
requires
belief
in
the
supernatural
and
that
migration
by
is
the
more
rational
theory
of
the
two
but
alphonse
de
candolle
quite
as
high
authority
as
we
can
quote
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
marine
currents
and
all
other
suggested
means
of
distant
transportation
have
played
only
a
very
small
part
in
the
actual
dispersion
of
species
even
across
narrow
channels
and
the
near
arms
of
seas
but
why
should
the
appearance
of
this
fern
at
opposite
points
of
the
globe
with
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
and
continent
intervening
be
any
more
supernatural
than
the
presence
of
or
in
different
organic
infusions
if
the
vital
units
of
these
are
present
in
experimental
infusion
as
professor
bastian
virtually
admits
why
may
not
the
vital
germs
or
units
of
this
have
made
their
appearance
in
developmental
forms
both
in
new
zealand
and
new
jersey
at
the
same
or
different
periods
of
time
if
professor
gray
regards
the
microscopical
forms
in
organic
infusions
or
the
statical
forms
in
inorganic
solutions
as
supernatural
or
as
above
the
powers
of
nature
then
we
have
no
exceptions
to
make
to
his
position
first
prove
that
these
vital
manifestations
of
nature
are
above
the
powers
with
which
she
has
been
endowed
or
was
originally
endowed
and
we
will
concede
the
question
of
supernaturalness
and
drop
all
exceptions
to
his
line
of
argument
whenever
a
dynamic
law
or
a
statical
is
found
to
be
uniformly
operative
under
a
given
set
of
conditions
we
had
supposed
the
operation
not
to
be
above
the
powers
of
nature
but
in
entire
accord
with
them
and
hence
not
supernatural
but
let
us
see
into
what
an
inextricable
labyrinth
of
difficulty
we
are
led
by
this
theory
of
from
the
equatorial
to
the
zone
and
and
even
beyond
the
equator
to
the
zone
and
still
before
proceeding
to
consider
the
probable
duration
of
the
several
geographical
epochs
called
glacial
periods
on
which
their
theory
of
depends
or
considering
the
evidence
touching
these
glacial
periods
we
will
state
their
position
in
regard
to
these
possible
migrations
as
briefly
and
concisely
as
we
know
how
darwin
solution
of
this
problem
is
the
generally
accepted
one
of
the
evolutionists
as
well
as
most
of
the
present
scientific
world
as
the
truth
or
rather
the
falsity
of
his
pet
theory
of
evolution
depended
on
the
satisfactory
solution
of
this
vexed
problem
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
give
his
best
and
entire
mental
energies
to
the
gigantic
task
which
was
by
universal
consent
assigned
him
the
reader
shall
see
how
admirably
the
thermal
equator
is
crossed
by
darwin
with
his
vast
swarms
of
flies
mosquitoes
insectivorous
and
other
plants
forest
trees
anthropoid
apes
and
general
menagerie
of
wild
animals
such
as
would
gladden
the
heart
of
the
great
american
showman
beyond
the
most
extravagant
comparison
the
question
bear
in
mind
which
he
was
specially
called
upon
to
solve
was
how
the
temperate
forms
north
those
for
instance
of
the
warm
and
cold
temperate
zones
managed
to
cross
the
thermal
equator
and
invade
the
corresponding
zones
in
the
southern
hemisphere
just
as
though
there
was
any
more
necessity
of
determining
this
question
than
the
opposite
one
of
how
the
southern
forms
came
to
invade
the
northern
hemisphere
we
will
give
his
solution
of
this
problem
in
his
own
language
that
we
may
not
be
charged
with
misrepresentation
he
says
in
speaking
of
the
glacial
periods
as
the
cold
became
more
and
more
intense
we
know
that
arctic
forms
invaded
the
temperate
regions
and
from
the
facts
just
given
there
can
hardly
be
a
doubt
that
some
of
the
more
vigorous
dominant
and
temperate
forms
invaded
the
equatorial
lowlands
the
inhabitants
flora
and
fauna
of
these
hot
lowlands
would
at
the
same
time
have
migrated
to
the
tropical
and
regions
of
the
south
for
the
southern
hemisphere
was
at
this
period
warmer
on
the
decline
of
the
glacial
period
as
both
hemispheres
gradually
recovered
their
former
temperatures
the
northern
forms
living
on
the
lowlands
under
the
equator
would
have
been
driven
to
their
former
homes
or
have
been
destroyed
being
replaced
by
the
equatorial
forms
returning
from
the
south
some
however
of
the
northern
temperate
forms
would
almost
certainly
have
ascended
any
adjoining
highland
where
if
sufficiently
lofty
they
would
have
long
survived
like
the
arctic
forms
on
the
mountains
of
europe
in
the
regular
course
of
events
the
southern
hemisphere
would
in
its
turn
be
subject
to
a
severe
glacial
period
with
the
northern
hemisphere
rendered
warmer
and
then
the
southern
temperate
forms
would
invade
the
equatorial
lowlands
the
northern
forms
which
had
before
been
left
on
the
mountains
would
now
descend
and
mingle
with
the
southern
forms
these
latter
when
the
warmth
returned
would
return
to
their
former
homes
leaving
some
few
species
on
the
mountains
and
carrying
southward
with
them
some
of
the
northern
temperate
forms
which
had
descended
from
their
mountain
fastnesses
thus
we
should
have
some
few
species
identically
the
same
in
the
northern
and
southern
temperate
zones
and
on
the
mountains
of
the
intermediate
tropical
regions
we
are
sorry
to
spoil
so
ingenious
a
theory
as
this
to
account
for
from
the
temperate
zones
north
to
the
corresponding
zones
south
but
in
spite
of
all
the
great
names
which
will
frown
down
upon
us
in
the
attempt
we
are
obliged
to
demolish
this
altitudiness
structure
even
at
the
risk
of
its
tumbling
about
our
own
ears
but
first
let
us
lay
down
a
few
undeniable
propositions
on
the
strength
of
which
this
ingenious
and
purely
speculative
theory
of
darwin
must
rest
it
is
universally
conceded
by
the
scientific
world
that
these
glacial
epochs
however
many
of
them
there
may
have
been
in
the
past
and
however
few
there
may
be
in
the
future
depend
for
their
occurrence
upon
the
maxima
of
eccentricity
in
the
earth
orbit
about
the
sun
the
actual
amount
of
heat
which
the
earth
annually
receives
from
the
sun
is
in
no
way
affected
by
the
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
it
is
a
constant
quantity
and
only
unequally
distributed
on
the
earth
surface
being
neither
increased
nor
diminished
as
our
winters
occur
in
aphelion
or
perihelion
the
actual
amount
of
accumulated
about
the
two
poles
of
the
earth
is
also
a
constant
quantity
and
to
measure
the
severity
of
any
glacial
epoch
we
have
only
to
determine
the
exact
amount
of
ice
not
altogether
an
impossible
problem
about
the
two
poles
at
any
given
time
and
then
determine
the
effect
of
its
entire
transference
from
one
pole
to
the
other
it
is
not
probable
that
the
present
of
the
south
pole
extends
continuously
and
permanently
much
farther
north
than
or
mt
erebus
in
victoria
land
lies
in
about
this
latitude
and
it
was
only
a
few
years
since
that
the
coast
line
of
that
island
or
continent
was
traversed
by
english
exploring
vessels
from
mt
erebus
to
a
point
some
ten
or
twelve
degrees
further
north
but
if
we
estimate
the
southern
cap
as
extending
continuously
to
what
would
be
the
effect
of
its
transference
at
once
to
the
of
the
north
pole
would
it
extend
it
after
assuming
its
proper
glacial
slope
below
a
point
falling
within
the
present
subarctic
zone
the
utmost
limit
to
which
croll
in
his
great
work
on
climate
and
time
conceives
it
possible
that
it
should
extend
in
any
glacial
epoch
is
to
or
about
the
northern
boundary
of
england
now
unless
the
astronomers
and
physicists
are
all
at
sea
about
the
causes
of
glaciation
the
warm
temperate
zone
can
never
be
pushed
any
further
south
than
the
tropical
zone
nor
the
cold
temperate
any
further
than
the
this
would
be
the
extreme
limit
croll
says
in
speaking
of
these
glacial
periods
it
is
of
course
absurd
to
suppose
that
an
could
ever
actually
reach
down
to
the
equator
it
is
probable
that
the
last
great
of
the
glacial
epoch
nowhere
reached
half
way
to
the
equator
our
cap
that
of
europe
must
therefore
terminate
at
a
moderately
high
latitude
and
if
the
gulf
stream
flows
southward
during
the
glacial
period
north
as
he
supposes
probable
the
cap
on
this
continent
would
probably
terminate
at
the
same
moderately
high
latitude
assuming
that
croll
estimate
is
the
more
probable
one
it
would
only
push
the
cold
temperate
zone
down
to
the
line
of
the
gulf
states
the
warm
temperate
to
the
southern
line
of
mexico
the
to
the
central
american
states
and
the
tropical
to
the
united
states
of
columbia
venezuela
and
guiana
suppose
then
that
some
seven
hundred
thousand
years
ago
more
or
less
when
the
north
pole
had
fully
donned
the
earth
with
all
the
isothermal
and
isochimenal
changes
thereby
effected
what
must
have
been
the
line
of
march
taken
by
our
northern
vegetal
and
animal
forms
to
escape
the
cataclysm
of
ice
and
snow
then
impending
manifestly
they
would
have
flocked
first
to
the
gulf
states
then
to
mexico
and
afterwards
to
the
central
american
states
but
none
of
them
could
ever
have
been
crowded
through
the
isthmus
of
panama
since
at
the
height
of
the
last
glaciation
that
portion
of
the
continent
must
have
been
the
tropical
barrier
to
our
northern
forms
as
it
is
now
the
equatorial
barrier
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
however
we
will
suppose
the
northern
to
have
been
even
more
imperative
in
its
demands
than
croll
has
deemed
possible
driving
some
of
our
warm
and
cold
temperate
forms
down
into
the
lowlands
of
columbia
venezuela
in
the
extreme
northern
portions
of
south
america
but
how
would
these
forms
have
managed
even
then
to
cross
the
thermal
equator
and
secure
a
permanent
habitat
in
the
present
warm
and
cold
temperate
zones
of
that
continent
manifestly
this
question
has
never
been
practically
solved
nor
is
it
ever
likely
to
be
in
our
day
or
generation
it
is
nevertheless
susceptible
of
solution
as
darwin
thinks
by
easy
mental
processes
we
have
only
to
take
a
bird
eye
view
of
the
situation
and
mentally
follow
these
forms
in
their
long
geographical
tramp
from
the
northern
to
the
southern
hemisphere
they
must
have
started
of
course
some
twenty
thousand
years
or
more
before
the
earth
reached
its
last
superior
limit
of
eccentricity
at
that
distant
epoch
the
breezes
must
have
been
blowing
pretty
stiffly
in
our
present
temperate
latitudes
and
these
forms
would
have
been
constrained
in
due
time
to
seek
a
more
congenial
isotherm
they
must
accordingly
have
set
out
on
their
expedition
at
about
the
period
indicated
with
the
prospect
of
a
long
and
tedious
journey
before
them
some
twenty
thousand
years
must
have
transpired
before
they
reached
the
line
of
the
present
gulf
states
and
it
would
have
taken
as
many
more
years
for
them
to
deploy
to
the
right
and
successfully
enter
the
mexican
states
in
another
twenty
thousand
years
or
so
they
might
have
doubled
vera
cruz
and
headed
in
a
southeasterly
direction
for
the
central
american
states
the
thermal
equator
would
by
this
time
have
reached
a
point
some
thirty
degrees
south
of
the
geographical
equator
while
the
northern
would
have
swept
down
upon
the
traditional
hub
of
the
universe
or
some
ten
or
twelve
degrees
in
excess
of
calculations
to
have
accomplished
this
grand
glaciatorial
feat
the
north
pole
must
have
donned
some
twenty
times
the
amount
of
ice
now
about
both
poles
of
the
earth
and
so
changed
the
earth
centre
of
gravity
as
to
have
inundated
every
foot
of
land
on
its
habitable
surface
but
if
this
terrible
catastrophy
had
been
avoided
and
some
of
our
extreme
northern
forms
had
forced
their
way
through
the
isthmus
into
the
lowlands
of
columbia
they
must
have
done
so
at
their
greatest
possible
peril
even
if
they
had
reached
the
base
of
old
mt
tolima
in
advance
of
the
thermal
equator
now
fleeing
in
dismay
before
the
southern
with
all
his
isochimenal
hosts
in
mad
pursuit
of
their
invaders
and
if
these
adventurous
northern
forms
had
succeeded
in
ascending
mt
tolima
they
could
never
have
got
down
again
with
the
assistance
of
forty
glaciations
but
we
can
imagine
darwin
promptly
snatching
his
pen
to
show
the
stupidity
of
these
northern
forms
in
not
climbing
popocatepetl
or
some
other
lofty
mountain
in
central
america
or
mexico
on
their
retreat
before
the
still
advancing
thermal
equator
but
how
this
would
have
helped
them
to
cross
the
geographical
equator
we
fail
to
see
when
darwin
and
the
eminent
corps
of
geologists
and
physicists
accepting
his
solution
of
this
vexed
question
can
make
a
warm
term
south
a
cold
term
north
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
solving
the
problem
ourself
but
unfortunately
the
two
terms
the
cold
one
north
and
the
warm
one
south
are
simultaneous
in
occurrence
and
the
same
causes
which
forced
these
northern
invaders
into
the
tropics
when
they
followed
the
thermal
equator
would
have
driven
them
ignominously
back
again
it
the
climbing
of
mountains
would
only
have
prolonged
their
disaster
for
after
the
glaciation
north
comes
the
glaciation
south
and
unless
our
cold
temperate
zone
were
pushed
down
beyond
the
geographical
equator
none
of
its
living
forms
could
ever
have
reached
the
corresponding
zone
in
the
southern
hemisphere
but
as
this
migration
theory
is
one
of
paramount
importance
to
modern
science
and
especially
to
darwinism
distinctively
so
called
let
us
at
the
risk
of
repetition
and
tediousness
propose
a
scientific
expedition
for
the
better
solution
of
this
problem
to
do
this
we
propose
to
cut
loose
from
our
stupid
predecessors
the
plants
and
animals
and
invite
darwin
and
some
of
his
more
distinguished
european
contemporaries
not
omitting
professors
gray
winchell
yeomans
and
some
few
other
american
admirers
of
his
to
accompany
us
on
a
fresh
expedition
from
the
warm
and
cold
temperate
zones
north
to
the
corresponding
zones
south
in
the
interest
of
to
make
it
certain
that
the
time
fixed
upon
for
this
expedition
to
start
will
not
escape
their
attention
we
will
state
what
many
of
them
already
well
know
that
the
present
eccentricity
of
the
earth
orbit
is
very
low
being
only
and
that
in
the
year
of
our
lord
it
will
reach
its
next
superior
limit
with
a
few
intervening
oscillations
of
such
minimum
value
as
to
render
it
hardly
worth
our
while
to
start
before
that
time
we
shall
be
obliged
of
course
to
invite
our
distinguished
european
party
to
join
us
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
as
their
own
narrow
and
contracted
continent
furnishes
no
proper
field
for
determining
the
problem
in
question
we
shall
insist
upon
one
condition
only
they
shall
never
leave
the
warm
temperate
zone
in
which
we
shall
set
out
on
our
expedition
except
to
pass
halfway
into
an
adjoining
zone
as
is
the
habit
at
times
with
plants
and
this
condition
will
have
to
be
rigidly
observed
otherwise
our
expedition
would
be
of
no
scientific
value
to
future
generations
as
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
provide
the
necessary
outfit
we
will
appoint
darwin
of
the
party
and
hold
him
responsible
for
any
misadventure
we
will
arrange
for
the
expedition
to
start
in
the
early
autumn
of
the
year
of
our
lord
or
about
twenty
thousand
years
before
the
earth
shall
reach
its
next
superior
limit
of
eccentricity
all
of
us
eager
of
course
to
brave
the
climatic
vicissitudes
of
the
journey
and
to
solve
the
great
problem
of
the
ages
which
is
to
determine
how
the
gigantic
elephantoids
of
the
eocene
period
managed
to
cross
the
thermal
equator
and
pass
into
the
present
arctic
regions
of
our
globe
as
the
king
never
dies
so
the
old
southern
will
be
succeeded
by
the
young
northern
one
at
about
the
period
named
we
shall
then
have
a
decided
advantage
over
our
predecessors
the
plants
and
animals
in
their
journey
southward
since
we
shall
know
the
exact
route
they
took
and
need
only
follow
it
presumably
they
had
no
such
information
nor
had
they
either
chart
or
compass
to
guide
them
a
circumstance
which
darwin
has
not
sufficiently
taken
into
account
in
predicating
intelligence
of
his
favorite
pedestrians
besides
these
vegetal
and
animal
forms
had
one
difficulty
to
encounter
which
we
shall
not
experience
with
all
the
northern
forms
driven
down
into
the
central
american
states
they
must
have
been
sadly
crowded
for
room
especially
near
the
isthmus
the
social
conifers
must
have
monopolized
all
the
more
favored
sites
on
the
mountain
sides
and
tops
while
the
humbler
denizens
of
the
forest
must
have
contented
themselves
with
still
more
limited
quarters
the
more
impatient
animals
for
lack
of
necessary
forage
must
have
crowded
through
the
isthmus
only
to
be
driven
back
by
the
tropical
heats
to
their
proper
isotherms
but
our
warm
temperate
zone
is
now
moving
southward
and
our
scientific
expedition
is
moving
with
it
the
northern
has
resumed
absolute
sway
and
our
aphelion
distance
from
the
sun
has
increased
some
tens
millions
of
miles
we
have
in
the
mean
time
moved
down
to
the
line
of
the
gulf
states
and
are
deploying
to
the
right
in
order
to
make
a
triumphant
entry
into
mexico
darwin
is
daily
consulting
the
isochimenals
and
is
confident
that
our
northern
will
equal
croll
highest
expectations
the
news
finally
reaches
us
that
the
gulf
stream
has
turned
its
course
southward
and
is
now
pouring
its
immense
treasures
of
heat
into
the
south
atlantic
if
not
turning
the
african
horn
and
washing
the
australian
coast
this
fact
greatly
increases
the
enthusiasm
of
our
european
party
and
they
hasten
forward
into
the
zone
almost
violating
conditions
in
their
haste
to
enter
the
tropics
at
length
we
crowd
the
narrow
passages
of
the
isthmus
and
the
glory
of
a
warm
temperate
climate
bursts
upon
our
view
in
the
columbian
states
of
south
america
expedition
promises
to
be
an
entire
at
least
darwin
thinks
so
and
he
is
now
the
sir
oracle
of
our
party
we
deliberately
enter
the
lowlands
of
columbia
and
make
ready
to
ascend
the
mountains
those
formerly
equatorial
where
the
great
scientific
problem
of
the
ages
is
to
be
demonstrated
but
we
are
measuring
time
by
almost
distances
and
vast
geologic
periods
sweep
by
without
apparent
record
the
northern
has
been
a
prodigious
one
crowding
us
nearly
down
to
the
geographical
equator
with
the
advantage
we
have
of
appropriating
some
five
and
half
degrees
of
the
zone
but
the
year
anno
domini
finally
rolls
round
and
the
maximum
of
the
earth
is
reached
old
mt
tolima
looms
up
in
the
distance
and
we
soon
ascertain
that
its
height
is
sufficient
for
all
scientific
purposes
its
summit
displays
a
glittering
and
we
are
certain
to
find
the
proper
isotherm
by
climbing
its
umbrageous
sides
we
accordingly
make
haste
to
reach
its
base
and
get
there
not
a
minute
too
soon
for
the
young
southern
has
stolen
a
march
on
the
thermal
equator
and
is
driving
it
irresistibly
back
to
its
old
quarters
his
march
northward
is
a
continuous
triumph
and
ovation
up
to
and
the
heart
of
patagonia
is
made
glad
by
his
near
approach
true
the
white
gates
of
commerce
are
closed
about
the
horn
but
that
is
no
concern
of
these
wild
patagonians
the
aggressive
britton
is
driven
out
of
new
zealand
and
that
is
another
source
of
joy
to
the
savage
breast
tasmania
would
extend
a
gladder
welcome
than
all
to
the
monarch
but
alas
not
a
drop
of
tasmanian
blood
runs
in
human
veins
cape
good
hope
has
now
a
climate
and
the
heart
of
the
wild
kaffir
and
zulu
rejoices
that
the
sceptre
of
perfidious
albion
is
broken
the
thermal
equator
at
length
reaches
the
base
of
mt
tolima
and
hastens
northward
to
the
isthmus
and
thence
to
hondurus
and
new
guatemala
where
by
sheer
force
of
exhaustion
it
comes
to
a
halt
but
as
the
equatorial
zone
extends
fifteen
degrees
both
ways
from
the
thermal
equator
its
southern
limit
now
rests
on
the
geographical
equator
and
accordingly
encircles
the
base
of
our
mount
of
refuge
we
are
now
up
this
mountain
some
sixteen
thousand
feet
above
the
equatorial
lowlands
with
the
tropical
and
equatorial
zones
between
us
and
the
possibility
of
our
further
migration
southward
without
violating
the
express
conditions
imposed
at
the
outset
of
our
expedition
the
fact
soon
stares
us
in
the
face
that
we
have
been
no
more
successful
in
our
efforts
to
cross
the
thermal
equator
and
pass
into
high
southern
latitudes
than
the
stupid
plants
and
animals
before
us
and
mr
faith
in
high
mountains
springing
from
equatorial
lowlands
disappears
in
jest
and
derision
as
we
all
agree
to
break
conditions
and
find
our
way
back
to
the
centres
of
activity
and
trade
in
the
old
and
new
worlds
leaving
the
great
scientific
problem
of
the
ages
to
solve
itself
as
best
it
may
we
accordingly
descend
from
our
mountain
fastness
hasten
to
the
coast
and
take
passage
by
steamer
to
manhattan
the
great
commercial
metropolis
of
the
world
here
we
find
that
the
barometer
of
exchange
was
long
ago
taken
down
in
london
and
hung
up
in
new
york
the
old
antiquarian
society
rooms
are
the
first
object
of
interest
sought
by
us
on
making
our
way
thither
we
look
for
a
copy
of
the
of
the
date
of
our
departure
in
which
we
find
an
account
of
the
scientific
expedition
fitted
out
by
us
facetiously
termed
great
chase
after
the
thermal
presenting
one
of
the
most
humorous
bits
of
sensational
pleasantry
ever
given
to
the
american
public
but
an
apology
is
due
the
staider
reader
for
the
seeming
levity
of
this
narrative
adventure
the
exposition
of
darwin
though
widely
accepted
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
by
the
scientific
world
has
seemed
to
us
too
trivial
for
serious
reply
if
we
have
leaped
over
vast
periods
of
time
it
makes
no
difference
with
the
argument
so
long
as
the
thermal
equator
or
more
properly
the
equatorial
zone
or
any
part
of
it
lies
between
the
warm
or
cold
temperate
forms
whether
plants
or
animals
and
their
point
of
destination
in
the
southern
hemisphere
they
can
never
migrate
thither
any
more
than
the
right
whale
of
the
arctic
seas
can
swim
the
equatorial
oceans
nothing
is
gained
by
going
out
of
the
way
to
climb
mountains
except
to
hopelessly
retard
the
return
of
both
plants
and
animals
to
their
native
zones
if
we
have
not
demonstrated
this
fact
to
the
reader
fullest
comprehension
it
will
be
useless
for
him
ever
to
write
a
at
the
end
of
any
proposition
it
is
true
that
some
eminent
astronomers
and
physicists
hesitate
to
accept
the
theory
that
these
glacial
epochs
are
due
to
the
eccentricity
of
the
earth
orbit
but
the
argument
favoring
it
is
well
fortified
and
ably
advanced
and
if
we
add
to
the
astronomical
considerations
involved
the
physical
proofs
of
a
change
in
the
earth
centre
of
gravity
caused
by
the
excessive
accumulation
of
ice
about
either
pole
and
the
probable
shifting
of
the
gulf
stream
to
a
southerly
direction
during
the
glacial
period
north
it
is
difficult
to
resist
the
conviction
that
the
real
cause
of
glaciation
has
been
suggested
in
this
theory
with
all
the
ice
now
accumulated
about
the
south
pole
transferred
to
the
north
pole
it
would
make
an
of
over
thirty
miles
in
thickness
at
the
pole
and
one
sloping
in
all
directions
southward
to
about
this
accumulation
it
is
claimed
would
so
change
the
earth
centre
of
gravity
as
to
cause
all
the
equatorial
warm
waters
to
flow
southward
instead
of
northward
as
they
now
do
this
would
certainly
seem
to
be
a
most
wonderful
provision
of
nature
as
well
as
one
strongly
calculated
to
impress
the
human
mind
with
the
belief
that
an
infinite
lies
behind
all
possible
whether
witnessed
in
the
heavens
or
in
the
earth
in
astronomical
or
physical
phenomena
everywhere
we
see
infinite
perfection
combined
with
infinite
beneficence
in
the
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
nothing
runs
to
waste
all
things
are
conserved
for
use
but
in
all
the
outspoken
grandeur
of
the
universe
there
is
nothing
so
grand
in
exhibition
at
least
as
the
simple
faith
of
a
child
that
he
who
watereth
the
hills
from
his
chambers
and
causeth
the
to
know
his
place
will
watch
over
the
trustful
little

professor
gray
in
his
address
before
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
delivered
at
dubuque
ia
in
while
remarking
upon
the
wide
extent
of
similar
flora
in
the
same
plant
zones
says
if
we
now
compare
as
to
their
flora
generally
the
atlantic
united
states
with
japan
mantchooria
and
northern
china
eastern
north
america
with
eastern
north
asia
half
the
earth
circumference
apart
we
find
an
astonishing
similarity
but
why
astonishing
had
our
distinguished
botanical
professors
in
this
country
and
in
europe
thoroughly
informed
themselves
as
to
the
climatic
conditions
the
general
physical
features
geographical
characteristics
and
other
conditional
incidences
of
this
asiatic
region
in
the
light
of
all
the
physiological
facts
before
them
the
circumstance
of
this
great
similarity
of
flora
would
have
been
anything
but
astonishing
indeed
the
astonishment
if
any
would
have
been
expressed
at
the
want
of
similarity
had
it
been
found
to
exist
ever
since
these
distinguished
professors
have
had
the
great
of
arthur
renfrey
before
them
with
the
warm
temperate
zone
north
accurately
laid
down
in
its
proper
isotherms
as
well
as
the
different
classes
of
vegetation
peculiar
to
the
two
regions
referred
to
and
some
general
conclusions
of
value
to
science
might
have
been
drawn
therefrom
besides
the
fact
of
these
similar
antipodal
flora
was
well
known
to
many
of
them
before
this
chart
was
issued
they
also
knew
that
all
along
the
higher
mountain
ranges
of
this
country
as
well
as
in
europe
the
same
alpine
flora
was
to
be
found
under
the
same
or
similar
alpine
conditions
from
mt
elias
in
alaska
to
the
central
american
states
and
thence
through
the
isthmus
to
the
southern
extremity
of
the
andes
in
south
patagonia
there
is
one
unbroken
line
of
alpine
vegetation
pressing
the
sides
or
summits
of
the
loftier
mountain
ranges
at
altitudes
correspondingly
varying
with
the
latitudes
in
which
they
occur
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
alps
in
europe
and
the
himalaya
ranges
in
asia
if
not
of
all
the
mountain
systems
of
the
globe
these
and
hundreds
of
other
equally
suggestive
facts
all
pointing
to
geographical
climatic
and
other
influencing
conditions
as
the
real
objective
points
of
inquiry
have
been
constantly
before
our
botanical
friends
and
yet
they
have
been
content
with
darwin
theory
of
climbing
mountains
to
cross
the
geographical
equator
under
the
impression
that
an
enormous
or
rather
prodigious
would
ultimately
drift
them
into
the
southern
hemisphere
or
enable
them
to
coast
their
way
thither
with
the
greatest
imaginable
ease
but
why
insist
upon
the
migration
of
plants
growing
in
the
lowlands
and
about
the
bases
and
sides
of
mountains
and
not
suggest
some
means
of
transport
for
the
equally
beautiful
flora
known
as
alpine
on
the
mountain
summits
of
the
earth
these
are
distributed
as
we
have
before
shown
over
all
our
mountain
systems
in
all
latitudes
and
in
all
parts
of
the
globe
as
well
as
in
the
higher
regions
of
vegetation
as
we
approach
the
north
pole
surely
the
delicate
little
harebells
of
these
alpine
regions
should
attract
some
interest
if
not
sympathy
from
those
who
are
constantly
hunting
up
means
of
transport
for
the
more
hardy
and
robust
plants
that
seem
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
almost
anywhere
when
the
next
great
shall
sweep
down
from
the
north
pole
upon
these
beautiful
alpine
flowers
they
will
have
to
travel
somewhere
there
is
manifestly
as
much
necessity
for
them
to
get
out
of
the
way
as
for
the
rest
of
the
flora
how
will
they
manage
to
get
down
the
mountains
into
the
lowlands
and
traverse
uncongenial
plains
and
deserts
to
find
other
and
alpine
homes
they
can
never
of
course
get
very
far
away
from
the
regions
skirted
by
eternal
frost
for
their
cup
of
joy
must
be
chaliced
by
the
or
their
beautiful
life
is
soon
ended
but
if
all
our
alpine
flora
have
traveled
from
one
evolutional
centre
or
have
been
created
but
once
in
time
and
place
how
have
they
managed
to
cross
the
thermal
equator
and
spread
themselves
out
over
all
the
alpine
regions
of
the
globe
we
call
upon
darwin
and
professor
gray
to
rise
and
explain
not
that
we
want
any
explanation
but
that
their
theory
of
stands
sadly
in
need
of
one
the
theory
which
the
bible
genesis
suggests
to
us
is
fully
adequate
to
the
explanation
wanted
it
explains
not
only
these
alpine
flora
appear
where
they
do
but
why
they
can
not
appear
anywhere
else
it
also
explains
all
the
physiological
facts
to
which
we
have
referred
in
the
foregoing
chapters
wherever
the
necessary
alpine
conditions
exist
the
earth
responds
to
the
divine
command
and
the
beautiful
little
alpine
harebell
is
cradled
into
life
and
rejoices
in
the
bright
embroidery
it
wears
and
so
wherever
streams
are
turned
aside
to
flow
through
new
meads
and
sheltered
woods
or
over
broken
and
swaly
places
where
cowslips
never
grew
before
hardly
a
year
will
pass
before
this
wan
flower
will
hang
therein
its
pensive
head
while
all
along
the
line
of
the
stream
the
black
alder
will
make
its
appearance
in
the
lowlands
no
matter
how
far
its
current
may
be
diverted
from
its
original
channel
or
how
distant
the
supply
of
natural
seeds
for
nature
sternest
painter
can
only
delineate
her
as
instinct
with
music
and
vital
if
our
botanical
professors
would
come
forth
into
the
true
light
of
nature
they
should
accept
the
position
of
pupil
to
her
and
not
assert
that
of
teacher
so
long
as
they
continue
to
peep
and
botanize
upon
her
grave
or
over
ancient
mounds
and
hadrianic
tumuli
they
will
never
find
out
the
cunning
of
her
processes
much
less
the
means
she
employs
to
accomplish
her
perfected
ends
this
modern
idolatry
of
hypotheses
with
our
chronic
neglect
of
what
nature
is
the
great
scientific
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
our
botanists
all
agree
that
certain
plants
and
trees
disappear
hopelessly
die
out
from
the
of
necessary
conditions
when
will
they
come
to
recognize
the
reverse
of
this
undeniable
proposition
and
agree
that
the
of
necessary
conditions
may
cause
the
same
plants
and
trees
to
make
their
appearance
that
is
spring
into
life
in
obedience
to
some
great
primal
law
as
unerringly
obeyed
by
nature
as
the
attractive
force
of
the
universe
itself
for
nearly
half
a
century
the
fact
has
been
known
that
the
geographical
distribution
of
the
european
flora
and
especially
that
of
the
british
islands
was
referable
to
latitude
elevation
and
climatic
conditions
as
early
as
hewett
watson
a
botanist
of
that
day
in
his
published
remarks
on
the
geographical
distribution
of
plants
in
connection
with
latitude
elevation
and
climate
drew
the
attention
of
the
botanical
world
to
this
remarkable
feature
of
plant
distribution
while
the
late
professor
edward
forbes
pursued
the
same
line
of
thought
in
his
attempt
to
show
how
geographical
changes
had
affected
plant
areas
in
great
britain
as
far
back
as
the
last
glacial
drift
and
yet
all
our
botanical
writers
have
been
steadily
persisting
on
immense
to
account
for
their
geographical
distribution
and
have
given
us
maps
without
number
to
show
how
the
vegetal
hosts
have
traversed
vast
continents
swam
multitudinous
seas
braved
the
fiery
equator
and
scaled
the
summits
of
the
loftiest
andes
in
the
mean
time
no
botanist
of
any
distinguished
note
except
de
candolle
has
confidently
ventured
to
question
this
migration
theory
so
imposing
and
formidable
has
been
the
array
of
names
which
have
frowned
down
like
so
many
gigantic
ghauts
upon
the
audacious
questioner
but
the
present
actual
state
of
knowledge
on
this
subject
forbids
us
any
longer
to
accept
theories
for
facts
premises
for
conclusions
or
fallacious
reasoning
for
legitimate
induction
truth
and
daylight
never
meet
in
a
corner
and
no
one
in
our
day
need
go
to
the
bottom
of
a
well
in
search
of
either
we
are
forever
stumbling
over
the
truth
without
knowing
it
because
our
old
traditional
beliefs
like
so
many
superannuated
grasshoppers
are
constantly
springing
up
in
our
path
and
diverting
our
attention
from
her
there
are
physiological
facts
enough
daily
obtruding
themselves
upon
our
attention
if
we
would
but
notice
them
in
the
case
of
wayside
plants
garden
and
household
weeds
and
the
more
aggressive
vegetation
of
worn
out
to
satisfy
us
of
the
truth
of
our
theory
were
it
not
for
the
swarms
of
these
old
traditional
grasshoppers
continually
rising
into
the
air
before
us
and
shutting
out
the
truth
as
it
is
in
nature
and
the
worst
feature
about
this
whole
business
is
that
we
have
come
to
regard
these
multitudinous
insects
as
a
delight
instead
of
a
burden
but
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
pursue
this
subject
further
we
have
shown
or
shall
show
in
the
succeeding
pages
that
all
crystalline
forms
come
from
necessary
or
favoring
statical
conditions
that
all
infusorial
forms
come
in
the
same
way
only
their
conditions
may
be
said
to
be
dynamical
rather
than
statical
that
all
mycological
forms
fungi
are
dependent
for
their
primary
manifestation
on
conditions
of
moisture
and
decay
that
all
from
the
lowest
cryptogam
to
the
lordliest
conifer
is
dependent
on
some
similar
incidence
of
conditions
that
the
mastodon
now
only
known
by
his
fossil
remains
must
have
wallowed
forth
from
his
necessary
mire
plasmic
conditions
in
the
eocene
period
and
that
all
animal
life
must
have
come
from
some
underlying
law
of
primordial
conditions
as
impressed
upon
matter
in
harmony
with
the
divine
intendment
from
the
beginning
and
that
this
law
is
still
operative
in
the
production
of
new
forms
of
life
whenever
and
wherever
the
same
may
appear
we
shall
also
show
that
all
living
organisms
such
as
seeds
morphological
cells
perish
at
a
temperature
of
about
and
that
and
other
infusorial
forms
making
their
appearance
in
flasks
originate
not
from
morphological
cells
plastide
particles
bioplasts
or
any
other
vital
organism
but
from
indestructible
vital
units
which
are
everywhere
present
in
the
organic
matter
of
our
globe
and
ready
to
burgeon
forth
into
life
whenever
the
necessary
vital
conditions
exist
and
the
proper
incidences
of
environment
occur
we
have
also
shown
that
the
earth
still
obeys
the
divine
command
to
bring
forth
or
if
objection
be
made
to
this
form
of
statement
as
unscientific
still
obeys
some
inexorable
underlying
law
tantamount
to
such
command
and
can
no
more
help
bringing
forth
when
the
necessary
telluric
conditions
favor
than
the
cold
can
help
coming
out
of
the
north
or
the
clouds
dropping
rain
when
the
necessary
meteorological
conditions
occur
give
the
future
american
botanist
the
physical
geography
of
a
country
its
average
temperature
and
the
plant
zone
in
which
it
lies
and
whether
explored
or
unexplored
he
will
give
us
the
general
character
of
its
vegetation
and
name
most
of
the
plants
and
trees
peculiar
to
its
soil
and
he
will
do
this
not
because
he
has
any
faith
in
the
present
theories
of
nor
in
the
necessary
distribution
of
seeds
but
because
he
will
study
his
favorite
science
with
reference
to
latitude
elevation
climate
physical
characteristics
and
other
influencing
conditions
of
but
we
will
now
proceed
to
consider
the
duration
of
vegetable
species
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
evolutional
changes
they
are
undergoing
if
any
must
cover
infinitely
vaster
periods
of
time
than
we
have
any
data
for
determining
to
say
nothing
of
the
unverified
theories
the
evolutionists
have
been
spinning
for
us
our
geologic
and
paleontologic
records
are
becoming
richer
in
materials
more
interesting
in
details
and
more
authentic
in
character
every
year
we
are
turning
back
page
after
page
of
these
lithographic
records
only
to
find
the
domain
of
science
widened
and
deepened
in
interest
as
we
advance
or
as
our
rocks
are
being
excavated
our
mountains
tunneled
our
vast
mines
explored
and
the
beds
of
our
rivers
and
arms
of
seas
thoroughfared
and
traversed
by
the
iron
rail
meanwhile
science
exhibits
signs
of
becoming
less
devoted
to
theories
more
exacting
in
her
demands
upon
her
votaries
and
more
eager
to
extend
the
domain
of
facts
as
the
only
true
basis
on
which
to
rest
her
claims
for
future
recognition
she
is
less
dogmatic
than
she
was
a
year
ago
and
is
likely
to
become
less
so
a
year
hence
than
now
and
this
is
largely
due
to
her
methods
of
research
and
inquiry
she
is
now
everywhere
sending
out
her
hardier
and
more
enthusiastic
sons
into
new
fields
of
exploration
to
return
laden
with
ampler
materials
to
build
and
richer
treasures
to
adorn
a
temple
worthy
of
her
name
in
the
field
of
the
fossilized
fauna
and
flora
these
treasures
are
of
the
highest
value
and
interest
all
indicating
not
only
wide
areas
of
distribution
but
immense
periods
of
time
in
which
species
have
existed
without
any
greater
changes
in
character
than
the
necessary
shadings
into
varieties
would
seem
to
require
for
nature
everywhere
characterizes
her
methods
of
production
and
reproduction
by
a
loving
tendency
to
diversify
and
variously
adorn
her
species
as
if
to
express
the
infinite
conceptions
of
that
power
above
her
which
spake
and
it
was
done
which
commanded
and
it
was
brought
forth
from
the
fossilized
plants
of
atanekerdluk
a
flora
rich
in
species
and
wonderfully
preserved
in
type
and
the
miocene
flora
of
spitzenburg
to
the
southernmost
limits
of
vegetation
on
the
globe
science
has
reached
out
her
hands
for
materials
and
gathered
them
with
as
much
success
as
avidity
and
all
scientific
botanists
agree
in
referring
these
fossilized
forms
from
the
high
northern
latitudes
to
the
miocene
period
one
so
remote
that
we
can
form
no
adequate
conception
of
it
except
as
time
may
be
measured
by
geologic
periods
and
these
materials
show
that
varieties
of
the
the
oaks
beeches
walnuts
firs
poplars
hazelnuts
all
flourished
in
these
regions
during
the
period
we
have
named
many
of
them
must
have
grown
on
the
spot
where
their
trunks
are
now
to
be
found
as
their
roots
remain
undisturbed
in
the
soil
as
well
as
at
a
time
when
these
regions
enjoyed
a
warm
or
cold
temperate
climate
many
of
these
fossilized
and
carbonized
forms
are
identical
with
the
living
species
of
conclusively
showing
that
neither
natural
variation
nor
any
secondary
causes
have
worked
out
any
changes
capable
of
being
scientifically
expressed
in
genetic
value
there
is
also
abundant
evidence
to
show
that
many
of
the
present
tropical
forms
flourished
in
central
and
southern
europe
as
far
back
as
the
warm
epoch
in
the
eocene
period
and
if
these
periods
occurred
at
the
lowest
minimum
limits
of
eccentricity
in
the
earth
orbit
as
calculated
by
leverrier
formulæ
we
can
have
no
conception
whatever
of
the
length
of
time
actually
intervening
the
period
named
and
our
present
era
croll
has
given
us
the
limits
of
highest
glaciation
covering
the
last
three
million
years
and
shows
that
there
have
been
but
two
periods
of
superior
eccentricity
in
that
time
and
can
be
only
one
in
the
next
million
years
with
but
two
or
three
intervening
maxima
and
minima
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
of
any
special
value
it
is
true
that
he
assigns
importance
to
these
maxima
as
affecting
possible
glaciations
but
there
are
other
eminent
astronomers
and
physicists
who
differ
from
him
and
really
attach
little
or
no
importance
to
these
of
any
other
intervening
periods
of
eccentricity
if
croll
is
correct
in
his
theory
and
estimates
we
must
separate
these
superior
glacial
epochs
by
an
interval
of
not
less
than
one
million
seven
hundred
thousand
years
and
nearly
three
of
these
periods
must
have
intervened
since
some
of
the
present
tropical
forms
flourished
in
europe
and
if
these
forms
have
undergone
no
specific
change
in
all
this
time
how
many
years
will
it
require
to
work
out
even
of
darwin
many
evolutional
changes
the
kinship
between
some
of
these
arctic
and
fossilized
flora
and
the
living
forms
of
is
so
near
that
they
can
not
be
distinguished
by
a
single
difference
this
is
true
of
some
of
the
varieties
of
the
family
the
oaks
beeches
firs
hazelnuts
while
others
are
so
nearly
identical
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
classify
them
as
separate
varieties
at
all
events
if
they
can
not
be
placed
in
the
list
of
identical
species
they
can
not
be
ruled
out
of
representative
types
but
why
should
our
speculative
botanists
insist
upon
these
evolutional
changes
in
these
derivative
forms
of
which
they
are
constantly
speaking
paleontological
botany
has
given
us
the
very
highest
antiquity
of
species
and
the
most
that
can
be
claimed
is
that
nature
was
just
as
prolific
of
diversified
forms
millions
of
years
ago
as
now
because
we
by
forcing
nature
into
unnatural
if
not
repugnant
alliances
can
produce
streak
gillyflowers
which
some
call
nature
bastards
it
is
no
evidence
that
she
commits
any
such
offence
against
herself
her
alliances
are
all
loving
ones
she
indulges
in
no
forced
methods
of
propagation
if
she
produced
the
or
the
great
redwood
tree
of
our
california
sierra
as
far
back
as
the
crustaceous
period
she
has
propagated
it
ever
since
according
to
her
own
loving
methods
and
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
the
as
being
the
original
ancestor
of
this
tree
or
any
other
distinguished
branch
of
the
sequoias
how
much
more
rational
the
suggestion
of
professor
agassiz
that
these
trees
the
entire
family
of
sequoias
were
quite
as
numerous
in
individual
varieties
at
first
as
now
and
that
the
fruit
of
the
one
can
never
bear
the
fruit
of
the
other
again
take
the
still
hardier
and
more
numerous
branches
of
the
or
oak
family
de
candolle
has
expended
a
vast
deal
of
ingenuity
to
show
that
the
various
members
of
this
old
and
family
have
all
descended
from
two
or
three
of
the
hardier
varieties
he
arrives
at
this
conclusion
from
a
geographical
survey
of
what
he
would
call
the
whole
field
of
distribution
and
the
probable
historical
connection
between
these
congeneric
species
but
science
should
deal
with
as
few
probabilities
as
possible
especially
where
experience
furnishes
no
guide
to
certainty
and
only
the
remotest
clue
to
likelihood
we
should
never
predicate
probabilities
except
on
some
degree
of
actual
evidence
or
some
likelihood
of
occurrence
falling
within
the
limits
analogically
or
otherwise
of
human
observation
and
experience
in
no
other
way
can
we
determine
whether
an
event
is
probable
or
not
but
here
we
have
not
so
much
as
a
probable
experience
to
guide
us
geographical
distribution
in
the
past
is
hardly
a
safe
criterion
to
go
by
because
we
can
never
be
absolutely
certain
that
we
have
the
requisite
data
on
which
to
form
a
determinate
judgment
the
may
furnish
the
maximum
test
but
a
few
concealed
pockets
of
nature
may
bring
some
other
variety
of
the
congeneric
species
to
the
front
requiring
de
candolle
to
correct
his
classification
there
are
no
less
than
varieties
of
this
one
species
of
oak
all
of
them
conceded
to
be
spontaneous
in
origin
and
it
has
been
on
the
earth
quite
as
long
as
the
more
stately
tribe
of
sequoias
besides
not
more
than
one
part
of
the
earth
surface
has
been
dug
over
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
any
one
of
its
varieties
has
flourished
in
the
past
since
these
several
varieties
are
only
one
degree
removed
from
each
other
de
candolle
supposes
divergence
to
be
the
natural
law
which
has
governed
their
growth
and
not
hereditary
fixity
but
here
again
he
has
only
remote
probabilities
to
work
upon
no
absolute
data
we
are
still
speaking
of
his
fossilized
herbaria
not
his
modern
specimens
these
may
show
a
large
number
of
individuals
or
those
claimed
to
be
so
connected
and
yet
no
naturalist
can
be
certain
that
because
they
exhibit
similarly
marked
characteristics
the
one
ever
descended
from
the
other
for
the
universal
still
holds
good
that
like
engenders
like
and
we
search
in
vain
for
anything
more
than
a
similarity
of
or
logical
connection
which
justifies
a
recognition
of
the
in
jessieu
definition
of
species
but
similarity
must
not
be
mistaken
for
absolute
likeness
which
nowhere
exists
in
nature
infinite
diversity
is
the
law
absolute
identity
the
rarest
possible
exception
no
two
oak
leaves
for
instance
in
a
million
will
be
found
actually
alike
although
taken
from
the
same
tree
or
trees
of
the
same
variety
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
segmentation
and
branching
of
their
limbs
as
well
as
the
striatures
of
their
corticated
covering
sic
de
everywhere
and
with
respect
to
every
thing
nature
is
more
solicitous
of
diversity
and
beauty
than
of
similarity
and
tameness
of
effect
in
all
her
landscape
pictures
and
the
platonic
conception
that
contraries
spring
from
contraries
may
be
only
a
supplementary
truth
to
that
of
in
the
eye
of
the
soul
all
objective
existences
are
discerned
in
their
logical
order
or
as
consecutive
thoughts
of
the
divine
mind
as
outspoken
in
the
material
universe
to
insist
upon
cutting
down
these
transcendental
forms
into
the
smallest
possible
number
of
similar
or
identical
forms
may
be
all
well
enough
to
accomplish
scientific
classification
but
the
productive
power
of
nature
can
never
be
limited
by
these
mental
processes
of
our
own
the
oak
family
can
be
traced
back
to
the
miocene
period
and
consequently
enjoys
quite
as
high
an
antiquity
as
the
sequoias
professor
gray
in
speaking
of
the
and
its
probable
origin
says
that
it
is
traceable
in
europe
up
to
the
commencement
of
the
present
epoch
looks
eastward
and
far
into
the
past
on
shores
by
shores
he
undoubtedly
means
northwest
america
where
its
remotest
descendants
still
flourish
but
that
these
trees
should
have
waded
the
pacific
or
sent
their
acorns
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
after
new
habitats
on
the
asiatic
coast
is
hardly
more
probable
than
jason
voyage
after
the
golden
fleece
in
any
other
than
a
highly
figurative
sense
the
spontaneous
appearance
of
a
forest
of
oaks
on
the
eastern
shores
of
asia
was
just
as
probable
under
favoring
conditions
though
occurring
subsequently
to
the
time
of
their
appearance
on
this
continent
as
that
of
the
miniature
forests
of
samphire
or
small
saline
plants
which
spontaneously
made
their
appearance
about
the
of
syracuse
when
conditions
actually
favored
the
high
antiquity
of
the
oak
makes
no
difference
in
respect
to
the
principle
of
dispersion
since
geographical
conditions
are
what
govern
and
not
the
theoretical
considerations
of
the
speculative
botanist
wallace
formula
concerning
the
origin
of
species
that
they
have
come
into
existence
coincident
both
in
time
and
place
with
preëxisting
species
may
or
may
not
be
true
so
far
as
individual
localization
is
concerned
but
it
proves
nothing
in
the
way
of
original
progeny
nor
can
we
by
any
actual
data
before
us
satisfactorily
determine
under
this
formula
which
of
the
two
species
preceded
the
other
if
they
came
coincidently
both
in
time
and
place
their
existence
must
have
been
concurrent
not
separated
by
preëxistence
the
formula
may
be
true
to
this
extent
that
the
conditions
favoring
the
appearance
of
one
species
may
have
equally
favored
what
we
call
a
species
but
even
in
this
case
the
material
sequence
is
lost
and
we
have
nothing
to
express
a
relationship
as
from
parent
to
progeny
for
however
restricted
as
to
localization
each
species
preserves
its
own
characteristics
the
similarities
always
being
less
than
the
dissimilarities
these
and
other
equally
conclusive
facts
of
observation
led
professor
agassiz
to
question
any
necessary
genetic
connection
between
the
different
species
or
between
even
the
same
species
in
localities
his
idea
being
precisely
that
advanced
by
us
in
connection
with
the
bible
genesis
that
localization
depended
on
geographical
conditions
not
on
the
migration
of
plants
or
the
dispersion
of
seeds
the
actual
geographical
distribution
of
species
any
species
does
not
depend
solely
on
lines
of
ancestry
however
great
their
persistence
of
specific
characters
nor
on
any
principle
of
natural
selection
nor
on
the
possibility
of
fertile
monstrosities
but
on
the
simple
incidence
of
conditions
and
de
candolle
in
his
geographie
botanique
virtually
concedes
this
while
treating
of
geographical
considerations
in
connection
with
distribution
he
in
fact
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
actual
distribution
of
species
in
the
past
seems
to
have
been
a
consequence
of
preceding
conditions
and
he
is
forced
to
this
conclusion
by
his
virtual
abandonment
of
and
the
alleged
means
of
the
question
after
all
says
professor
gray
is
not
how
plants
and
animals
originated
but
how
they
came
to
exist
where
they
are
and
what
they
are
on
only
one
of
these
points
that
of
favoring
conditions
can
any
satisfactory
answer
be
given
except
as
we
defer
to
the
bible
genesis
which
explains
all
and
the
reason
is
that
we
can
never
determine
what
forms
are
specific
without
tracing
them
back
to
their
origin
and
this
is
impossible
orders
genera
species
are
only
so
many
lines
of
thought
on
which
we
arrange
our
classifications
just
as
the
parallel
wires
of
an
abacus
with
their
sliding
balls
are
the
lines
on
which
we
make
our
mathematical
computations
agassiz
would
not
allow
that
varieties
existed
in
nature
except
as
man
agency
effected
them
that
is
as
they
were
brought
about
by
artificial
processes
these
artificial
processes
are
quite
numerous
and
many
of
them
have
been
practised
from
remote
antiquity
but
they
seem
to
have
no
counterpart
in
nature
except
as
insects
may
contribute
to
modifications
by
the
distribution
of
pollen
but
all
modifications
of
this
character
tend
towards
infertility
while
few
plants
accept
any
fertilizing
aid
from
other
and
different
species
any
break
in
their
hereditary
tendencies
resulting
in
a
metamorphosis
that
involves
the
integrity
of
their
stamens
and
pistils
is
stoutly
resisted
by
nature
in
considering
the
question
of
species
therefore
we
should
confine
our
observations
to
those
produced
by
natural
not
artificial
methods
to
plants
as
propagated
by
the
loving
tendencies
of
nature
not
by
the
arbitrary
and
exacting
methods
of
man
those
looking
to
his
gratification
only
all
these
fall
into
the
category
of
nature
bastards
as
shakespeare
happily
defines
them
in
view
of
these
considerations
and
the
new
methods
of
classification
such
as
grouping
genera
into
families
or
orders
and
these
into
tribes
we
can
readily
understand
why
the
great
harvard
professor
should
have
wholly
eliminated
community
of
descent
from
his
idea
of
species
or
hesitated
to
regard
varieties
otherwise
than
as
the
result
of
man
agency
indeed
the
whole
question
of
species
as
well
as
varieties
is
likely
to
undergo
material
modifications
in
the
future
on
some
points
the
botanists
and
zoologists
differ
widely
already
many
making
likeness
among
individuals
a
secondary
consideration
and
genealogical
succession
the
absolute
test
of
species
others
on
the
contrary
make
resemblance
the
fundamental
rule
and
look
upon
habitual
fecundity
within
hereditary
limits
as
provisional
or
answering
to
temporary
needs
only
these
differences
of
opinion
would
seem
to
be
the
more
tenaciously
held
as
the
question
of
new
varieties
presses
for
solution
at
the
hands
of
nature
rather
than
by
the
agency
of
man
all
these
varieties
tend
less
to
new
races
than
to
cluster
about
and
can
go
no
further
than
certain
fixed
limits
of
variation
beyond
which
all
oscillations
cease
but
none
of
these
questions
touch
the
real
marrow
of
the
controversy
as
to
origin
or
aid
us
in
determining
the
duration
of
species
the
presence
of
the
two
great
families
of
trees
the
sequoias
and
the
oaks
as
far
back
as
the
miocene
period
if
not
extending
through
the
eocene
into
the
cretacious
is
conclusive
of
the
point
we
would
make
that
no
great
evolutional
changes
have
taken
place
in
the
last
two
or
three
million
years
and
none
are
likely
to
take
place
in
the
next
million
years
except
that
the
may
drop
out
from
the
vandalism
of
man
or
the
next
glacial
drift
ch
martins
in
his
voyage
botanique
én
norwege
says
that
each
species
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
is
a
kind
of
thermometer
which
has
its
own
zero
it
may
also
be
said
to
have
its
hygrometric
and
telluric
gauges
or
instruments
to
determine
the
necessary
conditions
of
moisture
and
when
the
temperature
is
below
zero
the
physiological
functions
of
the
plant
are
suspended
either
in
temporary
hybernation
or
death
and
so
when
the
hygrometric
gauge
falls
below
the
point
of
actual
sustentation
the
plant
shrinks
and
dies
while
without
the
necessary
conditions
it
would
never
have
made
its
appearance
there
was
nothing
more
imperative
in
the
command
for
the
earth
to
bring
forth
than
the
necessary
conditions
on
which
depended
in
the
first
instance
and
still
depends
as
we
have
endeavored
to
show
cooper
in
an
interesting
article
prepared
by
him
at
the
expense
of
the
smithsonian
institute
on
the
distribution
of
the
forests
and
trees
of
north
america
with
notes
and
observations
on
the
physical
geography
climate
of
the
country
after
classifying
arranging
and
tabulating
the
results
of
the
various
observations
forwarded
to
that
institution
indulges
in
the
following
general
observations
we
have
with
a
tropical
summer
a
tropical
variety
of
trees
but
chiefly
of
northern
forms
again
with
our
arctic
winters
we
have
a
group
of
trees
which
though
of
tropical
forms
are
so
adapted
to
the
climate
as
to
lose
their
leaves
like
the
northern
forms
in
winter
but
here
it
must
be
distinctly
understood
is
no
alteration
by
climate
trees
are
made
for
and
not
climate
and
they
keep
their
characteristics
throughout
their
whole
range
which
with
some
extends
through
a
great
variety
of
climate
the
italics
are
the
authors
and
we
suppose
he
means
by
tropical
and
arctic
the
and
in
making
his
general
observations
he
had
before
him
large
collections
of
the
leaves
fruits
bark
and
wood
of
trees
from
all
parts
of
the
united
states
including
portions
of
mexico
the
canadas
and
alaska
and
extending
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
but
one
of
the
most
important
elements
in
fact
the
important
is
wanting
in
the
tables
before
us
and
that
is
the
elevation
at
which
these
thousands
of
specimens
were
obtained
so
great
an
oversight
as
this
should
not
have
occurred
although
it
may
not
have
been
entirely
cooper
fault
he
had
his
materials
to
work
upon
and
may
have
done
the
best
that
any
one
could
with
them
and
yet
it
is
just
as
important
to
know
at
what
a
particular
tree
grows
in
its
own
plant
zone
as
to
know
whether
it
comes
from
a
or
region
but
this
was
not
the
comment
we
designed
to
make
cooper
labors
with
most
professional
botanists
under
the
delusion
that
all
our
plants
and
trees
originated
in
some
one
centre
of
creation
at
some
period
or
other
in
time
and
place
and
have
been
steadily
spreading
themselves
outward
from
that
centre
until
they
occupy
their
present
areas
of
distribution
we
have
no
objection
to
his
clinging
to
this
superannuated
faith
and
belief
if
he
derives
any
pleasure
in
flushing
up
these
traditional
grasshoppers
but
we
have
a
right
to
insist
that
he
shall
be
logical
he
wants
it
distinctly
understood
that
trees
are
made
and
not
climate
then
his
centre
of
creation
should
be
everywhere
not
a
localized
one
for
he
insists
that
no
alteration
can
be
produced
by
climate
but
that
the
characteristics
of
each
specific
form
are
preserved
throughout
its
entire
range
of
distribution
but
if
these
nomadic
and
migratory
forms
have
wandered
thus
far
from
their
centres
of
creation
it
would
seem
that
the
trees
had
either
adapted
themselves
to
the
climate
or
the
climate
to
the
trees
but
our
smithsonian
systematizer
will
allow
us
neither
horn
of
this
dilemma
he
insists
that
the
trees
were
made
for
the
climate
and
that
they
have
preserved
their
characteristic
features
during
their
entire
ambulation
upon
the
earth
surface
with
the
change
of
a
single
monosyllabic
predicate
this
proposition
is
undoubtedly
true
we
have
never
heard
that
plants
or
trees
were
made
they
were
ordered
to
grow
or
rather
the
earth
was
commanded
to
bring
them
forth
which
is
an
equivalent
induction
and
the
fact
that
they
grow
now
renders
it
absolutely
certain
that
they
grew
at
first
when
out
of
the
ground
made
the
lord
god
every
plant
of
the
field
and
every
tree
that
is
pleasant
to
the
sight
we

the

we
will
agree
with

to
the

extent
of
his
novel
position
that
trees
neither
adapt
themselves
to

nor
the

to

it
is
true
that

modify

quite
as
much
as
they
are

by
it
the
true

formula
is
undoubtedly
this
trees
make

and
flourish
without

change
in
characteristics
so
long
as

conditions
favor
they
make

is
not
a

question

as
we
assume
a
preëxisting
vital
principle
and
apply
to
its
elucidation
our
subtlest
dialectical
methods
we
are
told
that
god
commanded
the

to
bring

of

moved
upon

plato
has
uttered
no
profounder
or
more
comprehensive
truth
than
this
with
all
his
conceptions
of

what
is
life
its
various
theories
the
question
what
is
life
does
not
lie
within
the
province
of
human
reason
the
science
of
logic
or
the
intuitions
of
consciousness
to
determine
it
furnishes
no
objective
on
which
to
predicate
attributes
that
are
either
congruent
or
diverse
it
can
only
be
defined
as
the
coordination
of
the
in
nature
which
is
an
undisguised
form
of
reasoning
in
a
circle
we
can
ascribe
to
it
only
such
attributes
as
are
utterly
inconceivable
in
any
other
concept
or
object
of
thought
it
admits
of
but
one
attribution
and
that
embracing
an
identical
proposition
to
say
of
life
that
it
is
a
coördination
of
action
might
be
true
as
a
partial
judgment
but
not
as
a
comprehensive
one
otherwise
crystallization
would
fall
under
its
category
which
is
manifestly
an
illicit
induction
it
allows
therefore
of
no
possible
explication
analysis
or
separate
logical
predicament
it
stands
absolutely
alone
and
apart
by
itself
a
positive
vital
principle
or
process
of
action
which
all
physiologists
agree
for
the
sake
of
convenience
and
uniformity
of
expression
in
designating
as
a
property
in
nature
whenever
questioned
as
to
its
origin
the
subtlest
and
profoundest
intellects
in
all
ages
of
the
world
have
returned
but
one
answer
i
know
no
possible
origin
but
god
the
great
primal
source
of
all
life
in
the
universe
among
the
ancients
we
find
an
almost
equivalent
induction
in
the
phrases
borrowed
by
them
from
the
highest
antiquity
est
est
quodcunque
which
although
uninspired
utterances
strike
their
roots
deeply
into
the
of
consciousness
wherein
we
ascribe
to
god
the
issues
of
life
as
a
paramount
theological
conception
when
the
ingenious
and
learned
frenchman
defined
life
as
the
sum
of
all
the
functions
by
which
death
is
resisted
he
was
as
conclusively
indulging
in
the
in
as
if
he
had
said
life
is
the
antithesis
of
what
is
not
life
this
would
be
as
luminous
a
definition
as
that
which
should
make
theism
the
opposite
of
or
the
algebraic
statement
the
antithesis
of
one
of
no
definitional
value
so
long
as
there
is
no
known
quantity
expressed
in
the
formula
to
begin
with
begging
the
question
and
then
adroitly
whipping
the
argument
about
a
pivotal
point
as
a
boy
would
whip
a
top
may
be
amusing
enough
to
the
childish
mind
but
is
manifestly
making
no
more
progress
in
logic
than
to
substitute
an
ingenious
paraphrase
of
a
term
for
its
real
definition
it
is
a
mere
verbal
feat
at
best
without
the
possibility
of
reaching
any
determinate
judgment
it
is
like
some
of
the
phrases
we
are
likely
to
meet
with
in
the
categories
of
modern
materialistic
science
such
as
the
correlated
correlates
of
motion
the
potentiated
potentialities
of
the
undifferentiated
differentialities
of
called
by
special
condescension
on
the
part
of
the
materialists
life
all
of
which
is
an
easy
logic
but
a
whimsical
enough
way
of
putting
it
according
to
leibnitz
everything
that
exists
is
replete
with
life
full
of
vital
activity
if
not
an
actual
mass
of
living
individualities
but
this
daring
hypothesis
has
ceased
to
attract
the
attention
it
once
received
there
are
states
and
conditions
of
matter
in
respect
to
which
it
is
idle
to
predicate
the
for
the
great
bulk
of
our
globe
is
made
up
of
the
highly
crystallized
and
rocks
which
neither
contain
any
elementary
principle
of
life
nor
exhibit
the
slightest
trace
of
vital
organism
even
to
the
minutest
living
speck
or
plastid
during
all
those
vast
periods
of
uncomputed
time
covering
the
world
primeval
history
there
was
an
utter
absence
of
life
until
the
chief
upheavals
of
the
outer
strata
of
our
globe
now
constituting
the
principal
mountain
chains
of
its
continents
occurred
in
whatever
atomic
or
molecular
theories
therefore
we
may
indulge
in
respect
to
the
original
formation
of
the
earth
the
utmost
stretch
of
empirical
science
can
go
no
further
in
the
solution
of
vital
problems
than
to
touch
the
threshold
of
inorganic
matter
where
in
our
backward
survey
of
nature
vegetable
life
begins
and
animal
life
ends
all
beyond
this
point
must
be
given
up
to
other
correlates
of
motion
than
those
to
which
the
materialists
specifically
assign
the
beginnings
of
life
the
theory
of
panspermism
originating
with
the
abbé
spallanzani
in
modern
times
and
still
stoutly
advocated
by
pasteur
and
some
few
others
is
manifestly
defective
in
this
that
it
goes
beyond
the
inorganic
limit
in
assigning
vital
units
to
all
matter
even
to
its
elemental
principles
it
is
true
that
they
speak
of
germs
primordial
forms
of
life
that
are
many
million
times
smaller
than
the
smallest
visible
insect
but
their
assumptions
go
far
beyond
the
construction
we
give
to
the
bible
genesis
which
merely
asserts
that
the
germinal
principle
of
life
that
of
every
living
thing
is
in
the
earth
or
in
the
waters
and
the
earth
which
were
alone
commanded
to
bring
forth
some
of
the
panspermists
have
gone
so
far
as
to
assert
that
everything
which
exists
is
referable
to
the
to
yet
extended
vital
units
mere
metaphysical
points
like
professor
bioplasts
in
the
finer
or
living
things
endowed
with
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
perceptive
power
this
was
the
assumption
of
the
great
german
philosopher
leibnitz
who
carried
the
panspermic
theory
so
far
as
to
accept
the
more
fanciful
one
of
monads
those
invisible
ideal
and
purely
speculative
units
of
plato
which
go
to
make
up
the
entire
universe
extending
even
to
the
ultimate
elements
or
elements
of
elements
leibnitz
says
as
it
is
with
the
human
soul
which
sympathizes
with
all
the
varying
states
of
nature
which
mirrors
the
universe
so
it
is
with
the
monads
universally
each
and
they
are
infinitely
numerous
is
also
a
mirror
a
centre
of
the
universe
a
microcosm
everything
that
is
or
happens
is
reflected
in
each
but
by
its
own
spontaneous
power
through
which
it
holds
ideally
in
itself
as
in
a
germ
the
totality
of
things
but
the
specific
germ
theory
advanced
in
the
bible
genesis
is
capable
of
being
taken
out
of
the
purely
speculative
region
in
which
panspermism
landed
the
great
german
philosopher
it
is
a
simple
averment
that
the
animating
principle
of
life
is
in
the
earth
that
the
germs
of
all
living
things
vegetal
and
animal
alike
are
implanted
therein
and
that
they
make
their
appearance
in
obedience
to
the
divine
command
whenever
and
wherever
the
necessary
environing
conditions
occur
the
fact
that
nature
still
obeys
this
command
is
proof
that
she
has
the
power
to
do
so
that
this
indestructible
vital
principle
still
animates
her
breast
innumerable
experiments
as
well
as
phenomenal
facts
attest
the
truth
of
this
genesis
of
life
while
the
researches
of
professor
bastian
and
other
eminent
materialists
made
in
infusorial
and
cryptogamic
directions
confirm
rather
than
discredit
it
the
fact
that
it
appears
for
the
first
time
in
this
ancient
hebrew
text
can
detract
nothing
from
its
value
as
a
scientific
statement
granting
that
panspermism
may
rest
upon
a
purely
fanciful
and
unsubstantial
basis
it
is
but
fair
to
concede
that
its
great
advocates
have
honestly
attempted
to
explain
by
it
all
the
vital
phenomena
occurring
in
nature
as
pasteur
is
conclusively
attempting
to
do
now
it
is
certain
that
the
materialists
who
are
resolutely
antagonizing
the
panspermic
as
well
as
all
other
vital
theories
have
not
yet
gone
so
deeply
into
elementary
substance
as
to
shut
off
all
further
investigation
in
these
directions
neither
the
lowest
primordial
cell
nor
the
least
conceivable
molecule
has
yet
been
reached
by
the
aid
of
the
microscope
any
more
than
the
outermost
circle
of
the
heavens
has
been
penetrated
by
the
aid
of
the
telescope
we
must
stop
somewhere
and
when
we
find
a
scientifically
formulated
statement
which
embraces
all
vital
phenomena
and
satisfactorily
accounts
for
them
all
whether
it
originally
came
from
aristotle
from
plato
or
from
moses
is
a
matter
of
comparatively
slight
moment
so
far
as
the
scientific
world
is
concerned
at
least
it
would
seem
so
to
us
but
to
talk
of
the
origin
of
living
matter
as
the
result
of
the
dynamic
force
of
molecules
themselves
concessively
dead
matter
is
to
indulge
in
quite
as
fanciful
a
speculation
as
the
advocates
of
the
panspermic
hypothesis
have
ever
ventured
to
suggest
professor
bastian
is
forced
to
go
back
of
his
infusorial
forms
and
to
a
microscopical
pellicle
from
which
he
admits
they
are
evolved
but
why
evolved
does
not
the
principle
of
vitality
lie
back
of
the
pellicle
as
well
as
the
how
absolutely
certain
is
he
that
the
extremest
verge
of
microscopic
investigation
has
been
attained
in
what
he
is
pleased
to
designate
primary
organic
forms
evolution
is
a
very
potential
word
and
no
one
may
yet
know
what
boundless
stores
of
absurd
theory
and
metaphysical
nonsense
are
locked
up
in
it
he
admits
that
evolution
as
embracing
the
idea
of
natural
selection
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
vast
assemblage
of
infusorial
and
cryptogamic
organisms
until
they
assume
definitely
recurring
forms
that
is
rise
into
species
and
breed
true
to
nature
then
he
agrees
with
darwin
that
the
law
of
vital
polarity
or
heredity
as
he
calls
it
may
come
in
and
play
its
part
towards
effecting
evolution
or
variability
in
both
animal
and
vegetal
organisms
but
not
before
why
then
should
he
lug
in
or
attempt
to
lug
in
the
diverse
potentialities
of
this
word
evolution
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating
the
dynamic
law
governing
the
developmental
stages
of
his
microscopic
pellicle
this
he
will
agree
lies
far
below
the
point
in
primary
organism
where
specific
identity
or
the
law
of
heredity
asserts
its
full
recognition
all
below
this
developmental
point
is
inconstancy
of
specific
forms
with
no
line
of
ancestry
to
be
traced
anywhere
this
professor
bastian
readily
concedes
notwithstanding
it
cuts
the
darwinian
squarely
in
the
middle
he
says
both
gruithuisen
and
tréviranus
agree
that
the
infusoria
met
with
have
never
presented
similar
characters
when
they
have
been
encountered
in
different
infusions
nor
have
they
been
uniform
in
the
same
infusion
when
different
portions
of
it
have
been
to
the
incidence
of
different
the
slightest
variations
in
the
quality
or
quantity
of
the
materials
employed
are
invariably
accompanied
by
the
appearance
of
different
organisms
these
being
oftentimes
strange
and
peculiar
and
unaccompanied
by
any
of
the
familiar
forms
other
writers
of
equal
eminence
in
this
field
of
investigation
have
not
only
observed
the
same
characteristics
but
encountered
the
same
difficulties
in
classification
from
the
very
great
diversity
obtaining
even
in
the
nearest
allied
forms
so
great
is
this
diversity
and
so
multitudinous
the
different
forms
that
little
certainty
or
value
can
be
attached
to
the
classifications
already
made
even
professor
müller
after
he
had
convinced
himself
that
he
had
discovered
not
less
than
twelve
different
species
belonging
to
a
single
genus
was
subjected
to
the
mortification
of
seeing
ehrenberg
cut
them
all
down
to
mere
modifications
of
one
and
the
same
species
we
refer
to
these
several
statements
of
fact
for
the
purpose
of
emphasizing
the
true
genesis
of
life
as
supplemented
by
the
incidence
of
different
conditions
on
which
all
vital
manifestations
depend
the
presence
of
the
germinal
principles
of
life
in
the
earth
is
emphatically
averred
in
the
bible
genesis
and
we
have
only
to
connect
the
doctrine
of
conditional
incidence
with
this
averment
to
account
for
all
the
vital
phenomena
which
so
profoundly
puzzle
these
gentlemen
while
prying
into
the
mysteries
of
the
ephemeromorphic
world
whatever
may
be
the
character
of
any
infusion
or
to
whatever
incidence
of
conditions
it
may
be
subjected
it
will
produce
form
of
life
not
because
it
contains
this
or
that
morphological
cell
destructible
at
a
temperature
of
c
that
to
which
it
is
experimentally
subjected
before
microscopic
examination
but
because
every
organic
infusion
whether
undergoing
the
required
or
not
contains
vital
units
those
as
indestructible
by
heat
as
by
glacial
drift
which
burgeon
forth
into
life
whenever
the
proper
conditions
of
environment
obtain
the
slightest
variation
in
either
the
quantity
or
quality
of
the
material
employed
in
the
infusion
is
as
these
eminent
microscopists
agree
invariably
accompanied
by
the
appearance
of
different
forms
of
life
just
as
the
slightest
change
in
such
as
that
produced
by
the
presence
of
one
species
of
tree
with
another
in
natural
will
result
in
the
appearance
of
another
and
altogether
different
plant
as
well
as
truffle
tuber
but
the
theory
which
the
vitalists
are
more
particularly
called
upon
to
combat
is
that
to
which
the
most
rigidly
adhere
and
we
refer
to
it
in
this
connection
that
the
reader
may
compare
its
complexity
and
involution
of
statement
and
idea
with
the
extreme
simplicity
of
the
biblical
genesis
as
heretofore
presented
we
give
it
in
the
exact
phraseology
employed
by
professor
bastian
living
matter
is
formed
by
or
is
the
result
of
certain
combinations
and
rearrangements
that
take
place
invisible
colloidal
a
process
which
is
essentially
similar
to
the
mode
by
which
higher
organisms
are
derived
from
lower
in
the
pellicle
of
an
organic
infusion
this
definition
of
life
or
the
origin
of
living
matter
presents
a
hypothetical
mode
of
reasoning
which
is
eminently
characteristic
of
all
materialists
in
the
stricter
definitional
sense
of
the
word
there
is
no
such
thing
as
living
matter
or
dead
matter
as
we
have
before
claimed
there
are
living
organisms
in
multitudinous
abundance
those
resulting
not
the
or
the
elementary
principle
of
life
in
nature
as
there
are
also
dead
organisms
in
abundance
this
materialistic
definition
of
life
which
is
not
so
much
as
a
generic
one
even
begins
in
an
absurdity
and
ends
in
one
it
is
agreed
that
the
proligerous
pellicle
of
pouchet
the
plastide
particle
of
professor
bastian
the
monas
of
müller
the
bioplast
of
professor
beale
are
essentially
one
and
the
same
thing
except
in
name
they
are
mere
moving
specks
or
nearly
spherical
particles
which
exhibit
the
first
active
movements
in
organic
solutions
they
vary
in
size
from
the
one
to
the
one
of
a
second
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
appear
at
first
hardly
more
than
moving
specks
of
mucus
indeed
burdach
calls
them
primordial
mucous
layers
but
they
move
pulsate
swarm
into
colonies
and
act
as
if
they
were
guided
not
by
separate
intelligence
but
by
some
supervising
the
whole
work
of
organic
structure
this
is
the
one
elementary
unit
of
life
which
directs
the
movements
of
all
the

their

force
from
the
first
primordial

layer
of
the
superstructure
to
the
majestic
dome
of
thought
in
the
case
of
man
which
crowns
the
temple
of
god
on
earth
but
this
pellicle
of
professor
bastian
is
not
mere
structureless
matter
any
more
than
the
bioplast
of
professor
beale
the
fact
that
they
move
pulsate
work
in
all
directions
shows
that
they
have
the
necessary
organs
with
which
to
work
these
organs
may
be
invisible
in
the
field
of
the
microscope
but
that
is
no
proof
that
they
do
not
exist
organs
are
as
essential
for
locomotion
in
a
plastide
particle
as
in
a
mastodon
or
megatherium
and
if
the
microscope
could
only
give
back
the
proper
response
we
should
see
them
if
not
be
filled
with
wonder
at
the
marvellous
perfection
of
their
structure
but
into
whatever
divisions
or
classifications
we
may
distinguish
or
generalize
the
properties
of
matter
we
can
never
predicate
of
it
any
more
than
we
can
predicate
indeed
intellectual
matter
presents
no
greater
incongruity
or
invalidity
of
conception
than
vital
matter
these
qualifying
terms
are
applied
to
the
known
laws
and
forces
of
nature
not
to
insensate
matter
to
assert
that
life
results
certain
combinations
and
rearrangements
of
matter
and
not
them
is
utterly
to
confound
cause
and
effect
or
so
incongruously
mingle
them
together
that
no
logical
distinction
between
the
two
can
exist
as
an
object
of
perception
without
the
or
some
germinal
principle
of
life
lying
back
of
these
combinations
and
rearrangements
of
matter
and
determining
the
movements
of
their
constituent
molecules
there
could
be
no
vital
manifestation
any
more
than
there
could
be
a
correlate
of
a
force
without
the
actual
existence
of
the
force
itself
the
materialists
give
the
name
of
protoplasm
to
that
primitive
structureless
mass
of
homogeneous
matter
in
which
the
lowest
living
organisms
make
their
appearance
they
claim
that
this
generic
substance
is
endowed
with
the
property
or
power
of
producing
life
or
as
professor
bastian
puts
it
of
unfolding
specks
of
living
matter
which
subsequently
undergo
certain
evolutional
changes
but
whether
they
die
in
their
experimental
flasks
or
rise
into
higher
and
more
potentially
endowed
forms
of
life
it
is
difficult
for
those
following
their
diagnoses
to
determine
they
further
claim
that
the
same
law
of
vital
manifestation
obtains
in
organic
solutions
as
in
the
structureless
mass
they
call
protoplasm
both
are
essentially
endowed
with
the
same
potentiality
of
originating
life
independently
of
vital
units
or
as
they
more
persistently
phrase
it
but
why
speak
of
specks
of
living
matter
to
unfold
means
to
open
the
folds
of
something
to
turn
them
back
get
at
the
processes
of
their
it
implies
a
something
inwrapped
as
a
germ
in
its
environment
if
not
a
germ
what
is
this
vital
something
which
their
language
implies
is
our
scientific
technology
so
destitute
of
definitional
accuracy
that
they
can
not
use
half
a
dozen
scientific
terms
without
committing
half
that
number
of
scientific
blunders
specks
of
living
matter
is
language
that
a
vitalist
might
possibly
use
by
sheer
inadvertence
but
no
avowed
materialist
like
professor
bastian
should
trip
in
this
definitional
way
living
matter
of
what
certainly
not
of
matter
death
quickens
nothing
into
life
not
even
the
autonomous
moulds
of
the
grave
it
implies
the
absence
of
all
vitality
a
state
or
condition
of
matter
in
which
all
vital
functions
have
been
suspended
have
utterly
ceased
if
indeed
they
ever
existed
it
behooves
the
materialists
to
use
language
with
more
precision
and
accuracy
than
this
dead
matter
whatever
the
phrase
may
imply
can
bear
nothing
produce
nothing
quicken
nothing
the
pangs
of
death
once
past
the
pangs
of
life
cease
nor
is
there
any
birth
from
unquickened
matter
animals
young
trees
fruit
but
force
results
what
then
quickens
protoplasmic
matter
neither
vital
force
nor
vegetative
force
if
we
are
to
credit
the
materialists
they
would
scorn
to
postulate
such
a
theory
or
accept
any
such
absurd
remnant
of
the
old
vitalistic
school
it
is
rather
molecular
force
a
physical
not
a
vital
unit
that
gives
us
these
specks
of
living
matter
this
is
what
they
would
all
assert
at
once
in
their
enthusiasm
to
enlighten
us
on
a
new
terminology
but
molecular
force
fails
to
give
us
any
additional
enlightenment
on
the
subject
we
are
investigating
it
is
even
less
satisfactory
than
atomic
force
or
elementary
force
that
which
may
be
considered
as
inhering
in
the
elementary
particles
from
which
both
atoms
and
molecules
are
derived
and
since
both
the
ultimate
atom
and
the
ultimate
molecule
lie
beyond
microscopic
reach
the
assumption
that
vital
phenomena
are
the
result
of
either
molecular
force
or
atomic
force
rests
upon
no
other
basis
than
that
of
imaginary
hypothesis
to
postulate
any
such
theory
of
life
is
going
beyond
the
limits
of
experimental
research
and
inquiry
and
hence
adopting
an
unscientific
method
at
what
point
the
smallest
living
organism
is
launched
into
existence
started
on
its
no
one
is
confident
enough
to
assert
the
materialist
is
just
as
dumb
on
this
subject
as
the
vitalist
and
the
only
advantage
he
can
have
over
his
antagonist
is
to
stand
on
this
extreme
verge
of
attenuated
matter
and
deny
the
existence
of
any
force
beyond
it
the
postulation
by
him
of
molecular
force
at
this
point
is
virtually
an
abandonment
of
the
whole
controversy
he
ceases
to
be
a
materialist
the
moment
he
passes
the
visible
boundaries
of
matter
in
search
of
anything
like
undifferentiated
beyond
it
all
that
we
definitely
know
is
that
certain
conditions
of
protoplasmic
matter
of
organic
solutions
of
produce
certain
forms
of
life
and
in
the
case
of
solutions
certain
low
forms
of
life
but
whether
the
lower
rise
by
any
insensible
gradations
into
the
higher
more
complex
and
definitely
expressed
forms
of
life
is
altogether
unknown
that
any
such
gradations
can
be
traced
from
the
lowest
vital
unit
in
the
alleged
collocations
of
molecules
is
not
yet
claimed
these
primordial
collocations
like
the
lowest
living
organisms
lie
beyond
the
microscopic
aids
to
vision
so
that
the
ultimate
genesis
of
life
remains
as
much
a
mystery
as
ever
becomes
in
fact
a
mere
speculative
hypothesis
and
when
it
comes
to
this
sort
of
speculation
the
materialist
is
just
as
much
in
the
dark
as
the
vitalist
and
neither
can
have
any
advantage
over
the
other
except
as
the
one
may
adopt
the
analytic
and
the
other
the
synthetic
method
this
is
the
materialistic
argument
covering
the
origin
of
living
organisms
there
is
no
greater
microscopical
evidence
they
assert
that
these
organisms
come
from
invisible
germs
or
vital
units
than
that
crystals
are
produced
in
a
similar
manner
that
is
come
from
invisible
germs
of
crystals
but
this
is
overlooking
all
generic
distinction
in
respect
to
processes
or
modes
of
action
crystals
are
inorganic
matter
which
do
not
they
are
mere
symmetrical
arrangements
not
organic
growths
and
are
produced
by
some
law
akin
to
chemical
affinity
acting
on
the
molecules
of
their
constituent
mass
they
possess
no
vital
function
they
show
no
beginning
or
cessation
of
life
but
once
locked
up
in
their
geometric
solids
they
remain
permanently
enduring
forms
concessively
inorganic
not
matter
to
speak
therefore
of
the
germs
of
crystals
is
using
language
that
has
no
appreciable
significance
to
us
germs
are
embryonic
and
imply
a
law
of
growth
a
process
of
assimilation
not
of
mere
aggregation
but
at
the
risk
of
being
tedious
let
us
extend
this
argument
of
the
materialists
a
little
further
the
only
difference
they
will
still
insist
between
the
preëxisting
germs
of
crystals
and
plants
or
the
only
difference
essentially
worth
noticing
is
that
crystalline
particles
of
matter
are
endowed
with
much
less
potentiality
of
undergoing
diversified
forms
and
structural
changes
than
the
more
highly
favored
vital
particles
such
as
the
proligerous
pellicle
the
bioplast
the
plastide
etc
the
one
represents
mere
crystallizable
matter
the
other
the
more
complex
colloidal
or
albuminoid
substance
or
that
capable
of
producing
a
much
greater
number
of
aggregates
the
analogies
they
concede
end
here
but
the
difference
is
when
we
come
to
processes
the
true
experimental
test
in
all
classification
crystallizable
substances
that
is
all
they
pass
into
a
fixed
and
immovable
state
and
mostly
into
one
as
enduring
as
adamant
while
colloidal
or
albuminoid
matter
laboratory
protoplasm
takes
on
no
fixed
forms
only
those
that
are
ephemeral
merely
transitory
this
is
so
marked
a
feature
in
respect
to
all
the
primordial
forms
of
life
that
professor
bastian
gives
them
the
more
distinctive
name
of
ephemeromorphs
in
place
of
but
all
these
primordial
forms
grow
develop
into
vital
activity
not
so
with
a
solitary
crystal
everywhere
the
statical
unit
the
dynamical
unit
the
one
aggregates
the
other
assimilates
the
one
solidifies
the
other
opens
up
into
living
tissue
the
one
rests
in
the
embrace
of
eternal
silence
the
other
breaks
the
adamantine
doors
and
makes
nature
resonant
with
praise
great
stress
is
laid
by
the
materialists
on
the
changeability
of
certain
microscopic
forms
and
the
startling
metamorphoses
they
apparently
undergo
in
different
infusions
especially
those
forms
having
developmental
tendencies
towards
fungi
and
certain
low
forms
of
algæ
they
attribute
their
different
modes
of
branching
articulation
segmentation
of
filaments
both
to
intrinsic
tendencies
and
extrinsic
causes
the
latter
depending
no
doubt
in
a
great
measure
upon
the
chemical
changes
constantly
taking
place
in
their
respective
infusions
these
intrinsic
tendencies
they
would
have
us
believe
depend
upon
the
dynamic
force
of
molecules
rather
than
any
vital
unit
or
even
change
in
elementary
conditions
but
dynamism
simply
implies
that
force
inheres
in
or
appertains
to
all
material
substance
without
specifically
designating
either
the
quantity
or
quality
of
the
inhering
force
if
these
materialists
therefore
use
the
terms
dynamic
force
in
this
connection
in
the
sense
in
which
we
use
vital
force
or
in
the
sense
in
which
they
use
statical
force
as
applied
to
the
formation
of
crystals
in
contradistinction
from
dynamical
force
as
applied
to
living
organisms
we
have
no
special
objection
to
urge
against
this
particular
formula
it
presents
no
such
formidable
antagonism
as
the
vitalists
would
expect
to
encounter
from
them
dutrochet
is
approvingly
quoted
by
professor
bastian
as
asserting
that
he
could
produce
different
genera
of
mouldiness
low
mycological
forms
by
simply
employing
different
infusions
this
is
unquestionably
true
with
certain
limitations
and
the
chief
limitation
is
as
to
dutrochet
will
he
might
will
for
instance
to
plant
one
field
with
corn
and
another
with
potatoes
but
if
the
husbandman
he
employed
to
do
the
planting
should
happen
to
plant
the
one
crop
where
he
had
willed
to
plant
the
other
and
corn
should
grow
where
potatoes
were
planted
and
then
he
might
be
said
to
have
produced
corn
and
so
of
his
infusions
no
change
in
their
conditions
enabled
him
to
produce
one
species
much
less
a
genus
of
mouldiness
in
preference
to
another
by
any
change
in
the
infusions
employed
by
him
the
power
which
implants
life
in
the
mycological
world
implants
it
in
every
other
world
from
that
without
beginning
to
that
without
end
and
this
implanted
life
is
quite
as
complete
in
one
form
as
another
as
full
as
perfect
in
vile
man
that
mourns
as
the
rapt
seraph
that
adores
and
burns
all
that
the
materialists
can
claim
respecting
man
agency
in
the
production
of
life
is
that
he
may
take
advantage
of
the
uniform
laws
of
nature
so
far
as
they
are
known
to
him
planting
seeds
here
changing
chemical
conditions
there
using
different
infusions
in
his
experimental
flasks
organic
or
inorganic
as
he
may
choose
and
then
await
the
action
of
these
uniform
laws
he
will
find
them
operative
everywhere
and
if
he
studies
them
deeply
enough
he
will
find
that
they
are
not
so
much
the
laws
of
nature
as
they
are
the
laws
of
nature
god
professor
bastian
thinks
he
has
conclusive
evidence
that
what
he
calls
specks
of
living
matter
are
produced
that
is
independently
of
any
conceivable
germ
or
germinal
principle
of
life
implanted
in
nature
but
he
confounds
this
implanted
principle
of
life
with
the
living
organism
it
produces
his
morphological
cells
as
well
as
plastide
particles
are
among
these
living
organisms
as
is
conclusively
shown
by
his
own
experiments
these
all
perish
in
his
flasks
but
the
vital
principle
that
produced
them
that
which
becomes
germinal
under
the
proper
conditional
incidences
he
can
no
more
destroy
by
experimentation
than
he
can
create
a
new
world
or
annihilate
the
old
one
his
flask
experiments
therefore
prove
nothing
and
all
this
talk
about
production
is
the
sheerest
scientific
delusion
for
were
it
possible
to
destroy
every
plant
tree
shrub
blade
of
grass
weed
seed
underground
root
nut
and
tuber
the
earth
would
teem
with
just
as
diversified
a
vegetation
as
ever
a
few
trees
like
the
gigantic
conifers
of
the
pacific
slope
might
not
make
their
appearance
again
and
some
plants
might
drop
out
of
the
local
flora
but
the
omnipotens
of
virgil
would
descend
into
the
bosom
of
his
joyous
spouse
the
earth
and
great
himself
mingle
with
her
great
body
in
all
the
prodigality
profusion
and
wealth
of
vegetation
as
before
but
these
defiant
challengers
of
the
vitalists
who
refuse
us
even
the
right
to
assume
the
existence
of
a
special
vital
force
in
nature
are
anything
but
consistent
in
their
logical
deductions
for
while
they
resolutely
deny
the
invasion
of
vital
germs
in
their
experimental
flasks
they
talk
as
flippantly
of
the
germs
of
crystals
and
their
presence
in
saline
and
other
solutions
as
if
there
were
no
scientific
formula
more
satisfactorily
generalized
than
that
establishing
their
existence
even
professor
bastian
speaks
of
germs
in
a
general
sense
as
if
they
thronged
the
earth
air
water
and
even
the
stratified
rocks
in
countless
and
unlimited
numbers
but
we
fail
to
see
that
any
of
his
accurately
obtained
results
determine
their
exclusion
from
the
experimental
media
employed
by
him
for
that
purpose
his
unit
of
value
is
a
morphological
cell
a
derivative
organism
rather
than
a
primary
vital
unit
and
all
organisms
are
as
we
have
before
said
destructible
by
heat
professor
agassiz
is
pretty
good
authority
for
doubting
the
existence
of
such
a
cell
the
difficulty
of
assigning
to
it
any
definitional
value
is
that
it
lies
too
near
the
ultimate
implications
of
matter
those
shadowy
and
inexplicable
confines
not
yet
reached
to
admit
of
any
scientific
explication
necessarily
resting
on
objective
data
if
they
mean
by
germs
primary
organic
cells
then
none
exist
in
their
infusions
and
they
are
logical
enough
in
rejecting
the
idea
of
their
invasion
but
in
assuming
the
cell
to
be
the
ultimate
unit
of
value
is
where
they
trip
in
attribution
and
stumble
upon
a
partial
judgment
only
the
only
value
attaching
to
their
theory
of
crystalline
germs
is
that
it
conclusively
establishes
the
law
of
uniformity
by
which
all
structural
forms
are
determined
whether
they
originate
in
organic
infusions
or
inorganic
solutions
in
protoplasm
or
protoprism
the
crystalline
system
presents
no
variability
in
types
but
a
rigid
adherence
to
specific
forms
of
definitely
determined
value
whatever
geometrical
figure
any
particular
crystal
assumed
at
first
it
has
continued
to
assume
ever
since
and
will
forever
assume
hereafter
as
a
primary
conception
of
the
divine
intendment
to
speak
after
the
manner
of
leibnitz
it
can
neither
change
itself
nor
become
subject
to
any
law
of
change
or
variability
from
eternally
fixed
types
and
this
is
as
demonstrably
true
of
all
living
types
after
reaching
the
point
of
heredity
as
of
the
countless
crystalline
forms
that
go
to
make
up
the
principal
bulk
of
our
planet
in
this
light
and
as
affording
this
conclusive
induction
the
crystalline
argument
of
the
materialists
has
its
value
the
materialists
should
not
too
mincingly
chop
logic
over
the
validity
of
their
own
reasoning
if
they
force
upon
us
their
conclusions
respecting
statical
aggregates
or
crystalline
forms
let
them
accept
the
inductions
that
inevitably
follow
in
the
case
of
dynamical
aggregates
or
living
organisms
beggars
of
conditions
should
not
be
choosers
of
conditions
nor
should
they
be
al
lowed
to
dodge
equivalent
judgments
where
the
validity
of
one
proposition
manifestly
rests
upon
that
of
another
if
they
insist
upon
the
presence
of
a
chemical
unit
or
worse
still
a
crystalline
germ
or
unit
in
the
case
of
statical
aggregations
they
are
effectually
estopped
from
denying
the
presence
of
vital
units
in
dynamical
aggregations
and
if
they
further
force
upon
us
the
conviction
that
the
process
of
aggregation
when
once
determined
remains
in
the
one
case
eternally
fixed
and
certain
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
turn
round
and
insist
that
in
the
other
case
there
is
nothing
fixed
and
certain
but
all
is
variability
change
uncertainty
of
specific
forms
if
vital
units
have
only
a
hypothetical
existence
then
chemical
units
statical
units
and
morphological
units
should
fall
into
the
same
categories
of
judgment
a
great
deal
of
needless
ingenuity
has
been
wasted
both
by
the
vitalists
and
materialists
in
formulating
impossible
definitions
of
life
in
attempts
to
tell
us
what
life
is
but
herbert
spencer
is
believed
by
his
many
admirers
to
have
hit
upon
the
precise
explanatory
phrases
necessary
to
convey
its
true
definitional
meaning
he
defines
it
as
continuous
adjustment
of
internal
relations
to
external
this
definition
when
first
formulated
was
received
by
all
the
materialists
of
europe
with
the
wildest
enthusiasm
it
was
absolutely
perfect
all
the
phenomenal
facts
of
life
fitted
into
it
as
one
box
in
a
nest
of
them
fitted
into
another
the
universal
world
was
challenged
to
show
that
any
other
phenomenal
fact
than
the
one
of
life
would
fit
into
this
prodigious
formula
of
spencer
the
london
times
tried
its
hand
on
it
but
only
in
a
playful
way
it
said
all
the
world
or
at
least
all
living
things
are
nothing
but
large
boxes
containing
an
infinite
number
of
little
boxes
one
within
the
other
and
the
least
and
tiniest
box
of
all
contains
the
germ
the
elementary
principle
of
life
but
this
was
hardly
a
legitimate
characterization
a
nest
of
boxes
presents
no
idea
of
continuous
adjustment
nor
are
the
internal
relations
of
one
box
adjusted
to
the
external
relations
of
another
the
definition
is
really
that
of
a
piece
of
working
machinery
any
working
machinery
and
was
designed
to
cover
spencer
theory
of
molecular
machinery
as
run
by
molecular
force
but
the
earth
presents
the
most
perfect
adjustment
of
internal
relations
to
those
that
are
external
and
it
continuously
presents
them
even
the
upheaval
of
its
mountains
affords
the
highest
demonstration
of
the
adjustment
of
its
inner
terrestrial
forces
to
those
that
are
purely
external
and
much
more
does
it
show
the
adjustment
of
its
internal
to
its
external
relations
there
is
a
continuous
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
of
causes
to
effects
of
adjustments
to
in
respect
to
the
characteristics
of
the
earth
surface
its
physical
configuration
the
distribution
of
its
fluids
and
solids
its
fauna
and
flora
its
hygrometric
and
thermometric
conditions
its
ocean
wind
and
currents
and
even
its
meteorological
manifestations
all
showing
a
continuous
adjustment
of
interior
to
exterior
conditions
or
relations
the
earth
should
therefore
fall
under
the
category
of
life
according
to
herbert
spencer
definitional
formula
and
so
should
an
automatic
that
is
made
to
run
by
internal
adjustments
to
external
movements
or
manifestations
there
are
any
number
of
professor
bastian
ephemoromorphs
that
do
not
live
half
as
long
as
one
of
these
automatic
will
run
and
so
long
as
they
run
the
adjustment
of
their
internal
to
their
external
relations
is
continuous
the
success
of
spencer
definition
of
life
encouraged
professor
bastian
to
try
his
hand
at
it
with
this
definitional
result
life
he
says
is
an
unstable
collocation
of
matter
with
a
big
m
capable
of
growing
by
selection
and
interstitial
appropriation
of
new
matter
what
new
matter
which
then
assumes
similar
qualities
of
continually
varying
in
composition
in
response
to
variations
of
its
medium
another
big
m
and
which
is
capable
of
by
the
separation
of
portions
of
its
own
substance
it
shall
not
be
our
fault
if
the
reader
fails
to
understand
this
definition
to
untwist
this
formidable
formula
of
life
and
we
can
best
aid
him
by
grammatically
analyzing
its
structure
and
life
is
capable
of
growing
we
are
glad
to
know
this
as
a
vitalist
it
enables
us
to
take
a
step
towards
the
front
gets
us
off
the
back
seat
to
which
we
were
summarily
ordered
at
the
outset
of
this
inquiry
we
let
its
unstable
collocation
pass
for
what
it
is
worth
and
stick
to
our
grammatical
analysis
life
grows
is
capable
of
doing
something
this
assurance
positively
encourages
us
it
grows
by
selection
and
interstitial
appropriation
this
is
still
more
encouraging
it
emboldens
us
to
take
a
second
step
forward
life
we
feel
is
increasing
in
potentiality
by
appropriation
it
enables
matter
to
assume
similar
qualities
to
old
this
makes
us
more
confident
than
ever
we
take
another
step
forward
are
half
disposed
to
take
two
of
them
life
is
getting
to
be
almost
a
potentiated
potentiality
to
adopt
the
style
of
materialistic
phrases
it
causes
matter
continually
vary
in
bravo
we
unhesitatingly
take
two
steps
forward
on
the
strength
of
this
most
comforting
assurance
life
is
assuredly
getting
the
upperhand
of
matter
with
a
big
it
is
no
longer
a
mere
undiscovered
correlate
of
motion
a
hypothetical
slave
to
matter
only
it
wrestles
with
it
throws
it
into
the
shade
we
involuntarily
take
several
more
steps
forward
life
is
capable
of
has
almost
a
creative
faculty
here
we
interject
a
perfect
bravura
of
bravoes
and
stepping
boldly
up
to
the
front
demand
of
professor
bastian
to
throw
up
the
sponge
take
a
back
seat
and
there
formulate
us
a
new
definition
of
life
but
our
london
university
materialist
is
not
entirely
satisfied
with
his
own
definition
or
at
least
with
the
moral
effect
of
it
he
thinks
that
all
these
attempts
to
define
life
as
a
only
tend
to
keep
up
the
demoralizing
idea
that
it
is
an
actual
entity
we
entirely
agree
with
him
in
this
conclusion
the
infelicity
and
entire
inconclusiveness
of
the
definition
he
has
vouchsafed
us
can
hardly
have
any
other
effect
he
sees
this
himself
and
hence
this
to
his
great
work
on
ephemeromorphs
inasmuch
as
no
life
can
exist
without
an
organism
of
which
it
is
the
phenomenal
manifestation
so
it
seems
comparatively
useless
to
attempt
to
define
this
phenomenal
manifestation
alone
and
what
is
worse
such
attempts
tend
to
keep
up
the
idea
that
life
is
an
independent
entity
it
may
be
objected
that
our
grammatical
analysis
of
the
definition
of
life
is
unfair
since
he
manifestly
intended
that
it
should
cover
a
living
thing
and
not
life
as
an
abstract
term
our
reply
to
this
is
that
he
makes
no
distinction
between
the
two
life
with
him
is
simply
a
phenomenal
manifestation
the
two
are
correlative
terms
so
that
his
definition
of
the
one
must
necessarily
be
the
definition
of
the
other
either
as
an
identical
or
partial
judgment
but
let
us
take
his
definition
entirely
out
of
its
abstract
sense
and
run
it
into
the
concrete
the
able
pathological
anatomist
of
the
london
university
college
is
a
living
thing
he
is
therefore
presumably
a
phenomenal
manifestation
he
is
capable
of
growing
by
selection
and
interstitial
appropriation
in
reputation
at
least
if
not
in
the
direction
of
an
independent
entity
his
work
of
twelve
hundred
pages
covering
his
laborious
delvings
into
the
ephemeromorphic
world
is
conclusive
on
this
point
as
a
phenomenal
manifestation
alone
any
attempt
to
define
either
him
or
his
professional
labors
may
be
worse
than
useless
since
it
would
tend
to
keep
up
the
idea
that
he
is
an
actual
london
entity
we
are
very
confident
that
he
is
not
a
london
but
are
willing
to
agree
that
he
is
either
the
one
or
the
other
the
flaw
that
we
are
after
lies
in
his
interstitial
logic
not
in
the
hallucination
in
which
he
indulges
respecting
nonentities
his
assumption
that
life
can
not
exist
without
an
organism
of
which
it
is
the
phenomenal
manifestation
is
what
we
propose
to
deal
with
now
directly
the
reverse
of
this
proposition
is
what
is
true
an
organism
can
not
exist
without
life
or
an
independent
vital
principle
in
nature
any
more
than
celestial
bodies
can
be
held
in
their
place
independently
of
gravitation
the
vital
principle
that
organizes
must
precede
the
thing
organized
or
the
living
organism
as
the
great
formative
principle
of
the
universe
call
it
the
will
of
god
gravitation
or
what
you
may
must
have
existed
before
the
first
in
logic
we
must
either
advance
or
fall
back
insist
upon
precedence
being
given
to
cause
over
effect
or
deny
their
relative
connection
altogether
the
organism
is
the
phenomenal
manifestation
not
the
vital
principle
which
organizes
it
to
say
that
there
can
be
no
of
life
without
an
organism
is
true
but
to
assume
that
the
vital
principle
which
organizes
is
dependent
on
its
own
organism
for
its
manifestation
is
absurd
it
would
be
the
lesser
fallacy
to
deny
the
phenomenal
fact
altogether
and
insist
that
cause
and
effect
are
mere
intellectual
aberrations
or
such
absurd
mental
processes
as
find
no
correlative
expression
in
nature
as
that
embodying
the
idea
of
either
an
antecedent
or
a
consequent
plato
lived
he
ate
he
drank
he
talked
divinely
he
was
the
occupant
of
an
admirably
constructed
one
that
paul
would
have
looked
upon
as
the
temple
of
god
and
all
the
world
would
have
recognized
as
a
temple
his
head
was
a
study
for
the
greek
chisel
none
was
ever
more
perfectly
modeled
or
artistically
executed
all
agreed
in
this
and
yet
it
was
not
the
but
the
that
attracted
the
admiration
of
the
greek
mind
enkindled
its
highest
enthusiasm
drew
all
the
schools
of
philosophy
about
him
at
once
it
was
the
lordly
occupant
of
the
temple
the
indwelling
presiding
over
all
the
organic
phenomena
and
directing
all
the
dynamic
powers
therein
which
was
so
profoundly
present
in
the
living
plato
even
professor
haeckel
of
the
famous
university
of
jena
would
not
deny
this
with
all
that
his
new
terms
ontogeny
and
phylogeny
may
imply
when
potential
life
passed
over
into
actual
life
in
the
individual
plato
it
was
not
the
pabulum
that
assimilated
the
man
but
the
man
the
pabulum
if
this
were
not
so
then
the
mere
potentiality
of
growing
as
in
the
case
of
plants
and
animals
would
be
all
there
is
to
distinguish
the
phenomenal
manifestation
of
a
plato
from
that
of
a
mole
or
a
in
other
words
if
the
animating
principle
of
life
or
as
the
bible
has
it
the
animating
soul
of
life
is
not
what
manifests
itself
in
material
embodiment
but
the
reverse
what
can
professor
haeckel
mean
by
his
new
term
phylogeny
which
ought
to
cover
the
lines
of
descent
in
all
organic
beings
if
it
be
a
question
of
mere
pabulum
it
is
altogether
pabulum
is
nothing
without
a
preëxisting
something
to
dispose
of
it
it
is
not
so
much
as
a
breakfast
for
one
of
professor
protamoebæ
for
if
it
were
served
up
in
advance
there
would
be
none
of
his
little
to
partake
of
it
much
less
any
of
his
protogenes
as
the
famous
glass
would
say
in
her
of
cookery
if
you
want
a
delightful
curry
first
catch
your
hare
but
our
ingenious
professor
of
jena
dispenses
with
both
the
hare
and
the
curry
in
serving
up
his
pabulum
to
the
protamoebæ
the
improvident
pabulum
evolves
its
own
eaters
and
then
is
eviscerated
by
them
as
was
actaeon
by
his
own
hounds
as
life
therefore
begins
in
the
tragedy
of
mount
cithæron
it
is
to
be
hoped
it
will
end
in
the
delights
of
artemis
and
her
bathing
nymphs
chapter

materialistic
theories
of
life
refuted
the
methods
by
which
the
advocates
of
a
purely
physical
origin
of
life
seek
to
establish
the
correctness
of
their
conclusions
are
unfortunately
not
always
attended
by
uniform
results
in
experimentation
they
subject
their
solutions
of
organic
matter
to
a
very
high
temperature
by
means
of
flasks
the
tubes
to
which
are
so
packed
in
materials
that
whatever
air
may
enter
them
shall
encounter
a
much
greater
degree
of
heat
than
that
indicated
by
boiling
water
at
this
temperature
c
f
they
assume
that
all
living
organisms
perish
especially
when
the
solutions
containing
them
have
been
kept
for
the
space
of
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
at
this
standard
point
of
heat
but
in
the
light
of
all
the
experiments
which
have
been
made
in
this
direction
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
the
entire
correctness
of
their
assumption
that
many
if
not
most
living
organisms
perish
at
a
temperature
of
c
there
is
little
or
no
doubt
but
that
there
are
some
which
are
much
more
tenacious
of
life
that
is
possess
greater
vital
resistance
to
heat
is
equally
unquestionable
pasteur
for
instance
mentions
the
spores
of
certain
fungi
which
are
capable
of
germinating
after
an
exposure
of
some
minutes
to
a
temperature
of
to
f
while
the
same
spores
entirely
lose
their
germinating
power
after
an
exposure
for
half
an
hour
or
more
to
a
slightly
higher
temperature
in
a
paper
on
the
action
of
heat
on
protoplasmic
life
recently
published
in
the
proceedings
of
the
royal
society
asserts
that
certain
black
vibrios
are
capable
of
resisting
the
action
of
fluids
at
a
temperature
as
high
as
f
although
exposed
therein
for
half
an
hour
or
more
but
none
of
these
crucial
tests
however
diverse
in
experimental
results
really
touch
the
question
in
controversy
they
all
relate
either
to
living
organisms
or
to
the
seeds
and
spores
of
vegetation
not
to
living
indestructible
germs
invisible
vital
units
declared
to
be
in
the
earth
itself
we
use
the
term
vital
unit
in
the
same
restricted
sense
in
which
the
materialists
speak
of
chemical
units
morphological
units
which
they
admit
are
invisible
in
the
microscopic
field
and
hence
they
can
have
no
positive
information
as
to
their
destructibility
or
indestructibility
by
heat
that
this
vital
unit
lies
in
its
true
functional
tendencies
between
the
chemical
and
morphological
units
manifesting
itself
in
the
conditions
of
the
one
and
resulting
in
the
structural
development
of
the
other
is
no
new
or
startling
theory
but
one
that
has
been
more
or
less
obscurely
hinted
at
by
leibnitz
and
even
acknowledged
as
possible
by
herbert
spencer
it
is
this
vital
unit
that
assimilates
or
aggregates
protoplasmic
matter
into
the
morphological
cell
or
the
initial
organism
in
a
vital
structure
or
an
approach
towards
structural
form
morphological
cells
are
not
therefore
units
considered
as
the
least
of
any
given
whole
nor
are
they
mere
structureless
matter
or
any
more
homogeneous
in
character
than
in
substance
different
chemical
solutions
give
rise
to
different
morphological
cells
as
differently
constituted
soils
produce
different
vegetal
growths
change
the
chemical
conditions
in
any
solution
or
infusion
and
you
change
the
entire
morphological
character
of
the
infusoria
appearing
therein
the
cells
are
living
organisms
springing
from
vital
units
and
can
no
more
manifest
themselves
independently
of
these
units
than
life
can
manifest
itself
independently
of
an
actual
organism
and
they
make
their
appearance
in
the
proper
environing
conditions
just
as
the
oak
comes
from
its
primordial
germ
or
vital
unit
in
the
chemically
changed
conditions
of
the
soil
everywhere
the
vital
germ
or
unit
precedes
the
vital
growth
as
the
plant
or
tree
precedes
the
natural
seeds
it
bears
this
is
not
only
the
logical
order
but
the
exact
scientific
method
of
vital
manifestation
and
growth
in
this
truth
lies
the
whole
mystery
of
vegetal
and
animal
life
as
hitherto
manifested
on
our
globe
with
the
single
exception
of
man
whose
crowning
distinction
it
was
to
receive
a
living
soul
this
may
be
rejected
as
a
scientific
statement
but
its
verification
will
appear
in
the
very
act
of
its
rejection
pry
as
deeply
as
we
may
into
the
of
nature
in
search
of
exact
scientific
truth
and
we
shall
ultimately
land
in
one
or
the
other
of
these
propositions
either
that
nature
was
originally
endowed
with
some
occult
and
unknown
power
to
bring
forth
which
power
is
either
continuously
inherent
or
continuously
imparted
or
else
specific
creation
was
the
predetermined
plan
and
purpose
with
no
higher
or
more
specialized
animal
or
vegetal
forms
than
were
specifically
created
in
the
beginning
otherwise
we
are
inevitably
forced
back
by
our
mental
processes
which
we
can
not
resist
upon
an
effect
without
a
cause
a
physical
law
of
the
universe
without
any
conceivable
an
principle
of
matter
which
must
have
existed
as
a
cause
infinitely
anterior
to
its
first
effect
and
this
is
forcing
language
into
such
crazy
and
paralytic
conclusions
as
to
utterly
destroy
its
efficiency
as
a
vehicle
of
thought
to
conceive
of
the
existence
of
the
universe
or
of
any
possible
law
that
may
be
operative
therein
without
an
adequate
antecedent
cause
is
as
metaphysically
impossible
as
to
conceive
of
substance
without
form
space
without
extension
or
a
god
who
has
been
superceded
in
the
universe
by
the
operation
of
his
own
laws
for
if
the
and
intelligence
of
the
universe
has
ceased
to
ordain
and
arrange
if
all
things
therein
have
been
left
to
the
operation
of
fixed
and
eternally
unchangeable
laws
then
no
further
supervisional
direction
is
required
on
the
part
of
either
an
infinite
or
a
finite
intelligence
and
our
idea
of
a
god
must
disappear
in
the
paramount
induction
of
a
universe
which
has
successfully
risen
up
in
insurrection
against
its
own
maker
and
lawgiver
if
it
has
not
remorselessly
consigned
him
to
some
inconceivable
limbo
outside
of
the
universe
itself
but
this
titanic
and
worse
than
satanic
insurrection
on
the
part
of
a
universe
of
matter
and
motion
is
only
the
conjectural
coinage
of
the
human
brain
the
wild
supposition
hazarded
by
the
materialistic
mind
and
fortunately
has
no
conceivable
counterpart
outside
of
it
but
the
palpable
blunder
in
materialistic
science
consists
in
its
overlooking
the
necessary
outgrowth
of
theological
ideas
in
the
human
mind
as
conclusively
a
phenomenal
fact
of
nature
as
the
invariable
uniformity
of
astronomical
movements
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tides
or
the
waves
of
the
earth
itself
and
nature
furnishes
no
greater
clue
to
the
one
set
of
phenomena
than
the
other
for
when
we
say
that
bodies
act
one
upon
another
by
the
force
of
gravity
we
are
no
nearer
an
explication
of
the
force
itself
than
we
should
be
were
we
to
allege
any
corresponding
manifestation
on
the
part
of
the
human
mind
kant
says
we
can
not
conceive
of
the
existence
of
matter
without
the
forces
of
attraction
and
repulsion
the
conflict
of
two
elementary
forces
in
the
universe
much
less
can
we
have
any
conception
of
the
elementary
forces
themselves
science
can
therefore
assign
no
more
conclusive
reason
for
overlooking
psychical
manifestations
than
physical
phenomena
nor
is
the
one
set
of
phenomena
any
more
marvellous
in
its
manifestations
than
the
other
they
may
both
furnish
food
for
speculative
thought
and
inquiry
and
yet
the
nearer
we
get
to
the
ultimate
implications
of
either
the
more
completely
are
we
lost
in
professor
tyndall
primordial
haze
from
which
he
assumes
that
the
universe
and
all
the
phenomenal
manifestations
therein
originally
came
but
however
rapidly
these
materialistic
theories
may
disappear
in
the
scientific
of
the
future
there
is
one
sublime
verity
that
will
stand
the
test
of
all
time
and
that
is
that
the
moral
universe
of
god
is
no
less
complete
in
the
divine
intendment
than
the
physical
universe
while
the
latter
is
so
and
with
the
former
in
all
its
conceivable
relations
that
it
can
no
more
exist
independently
of
its
correlative
than
matter
can
exist
independently
of
space
or
time
independently
of
eternity
according
to
this
view
of
leibnitz
all
living
organisms
have
their
own
essence
or
essential
qualities
and
characteristics
they
have
been
from
all
eternity
in
the
divine
intendment
and
can
undergo
no
changes
or
modifications
which
shall
make
them
essentially
different
from
what
they
were
in
the
beginning
or
are
now
this
is
not
only
true
of
the
germs
that
are
in
themselves
upon
the
earth
but
of
every
living
thing
whether
lying
within
or
beyond
the
telescopic
or
microscopic
limits
as
a
law
of
causation
as
well
as
of
consecutive
thought
there
must
be
in
the
order
of
life
all
life
a
continuous
chain
of
ideas
linking
the
past
to
the
present
the
present
to
the
future
and
the
future
to
eternity
but
that
this
continuous
chain
is
dependent
on
mere
physical
changes
or
manifestations
is
a
logical
induction
utterly
incapable
of
being
exhibited
in
scientific
formulæ
the
higher
and
more
satisfactory
induction
is
that
which
places
cause
before
effect
the
maker
before
the
made
the
creator
before
the
creature
and
so
on
in
the
analogical
order
till
the
smallest
conceivable
vital
unit
is
reached
in
the
universe
of
organic
matter
to
begin
therefore
with
microscopic
observation
at
a
point
in
the
ephemeromorphic
world
where
that
optical
instrument
fails
to
give
back
any
intelligible
answer
and
synthetically
follow
this
chain
of
causation
upward
and
outward
to
tyndall
fiery
cloud
of
mist
in
which
it
is
assumed
that
all
the
diversified
possibilities
and
potentialities
of
the
universe
once
lay
latent
may
answer
the
logical
necessities
of
the
evolution
theory
but
will
never
satisfy
the
inductive
processes
of
a
plato
a
leibnitz
or
a
newton
professor
tyndall
in
speaking
of
his
theory
says
many
who
hold
the
hypothesis
of
natural
evolution
would
probably
assent
to
the
position
his
position
that
at
the
present
moment
all
our
philosophy
all
our
poetry
all
our
science
all
our
art
plato
shakespeare
newton
and
a
da
vinci
are
potential
in
the
fires
of
the
sun
but
to
be
consistent
in
their
inductions
they
should
proclaim
themselves
at
once
and
ascribe
to
that
transcendent
luminary
all
the
potentialities
of
a
universe
from
the
hand
of
god
but
what
possible
advantage
we
would
ask
can
this
physical
hypothesis
of
life
have
over
that
which
ascribes
to
god
the
issues
of
all
life
in
the
universe
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
living
organism
we
can
positively
conceive
of
none
but
that
of
placing
the
cosmological
cart
before
the
horse
and
so
harnessing
cause
and
effect
that
the
latter
shall
uniformly
precede
the
former
in
the
chain
of
logical
induction
as
a
dialectical
feat
in
exhibiting
the
higher
possibilities
of
logic
it
may
have
its
advantages
in
subordinating
the
facts
of
science
to
the
higher
illuminations
of
fancy
and
thus
resting
the
basis
of
reality
on
the
and
assumptions
of
the
human
mind
for
the
materialistic
theories
of
are
not
those
of
yesterday
nor
is
there
any
certainty
that
they
will
be
those
of
they
are
almost
as
fantastic
and
variable
as
the
forms
of
the
kaleidoscope
although
as
a
general
rule
they
lack
the
symmetrical
arrangements
and
proportions
of
that
scientific
toy
professor
bastian
in
considering
the
heterogenetic
phenomena
of
living
matter
is
obliged
to
fall
back
near
the
end
of
his
great
work
on
the
countless
myriads
of
living
units
which
have
been
evolved
in
the
different
ages
of
the
world
history
but
by
what
process
a
vital
unit
can
be
he
does
not
condescend
to
tell
us
he
has
no
primordial
formless
fog
to
fall
back
upon
as
has
professor
tyndall
nor
can
he
imagine
anything
beyond
the
least
of
possible
conceptions
in
a
chemical
morphological
or
vital
unit
a
unit
can
neither
be
evolved
nor
involved
it
admits
of
no
square
no
multiple
no
differentiation
it
is
simply
the
unit
of
organic
polarity
by
which
it
multiplies
effects
but
can
never
be
multiplied
itself
the
chief
fault
that
we
have
to
find
with
the
london
university
professor
is
that
he
confounds
a
morphological
cell
with
a
morphological
unit
and
insists
upon
drawing
unwarrantable
conclusions
therefrom
his
countless
myriads
of
living
units
are
all
well
enough
in
their
way
that
they
exist
in
the
earth
and
are
constantly
developed
into
innumerable
multitudes
of
living
organisms
of
almost
inconceivable
variety
in
both
the
animal
and
vegetal
world
is
true
as
he
admits
in
almost
the
identical
language
we
here
use
and
he
also
admits
that
morphological
cells
when
once
formed
continue
to
grow
by
their
own
individual
power
or
inherent
tendency
but
before
they
can
manifest
any
such
inherent
tendency
they
must
be
developed
from
the
vital
units
that
lie
back
of
them
and
on
which
their
manifestation
unquestionably
depends
the
only
doubt
that
can
possibly
exist
on
this
point
is
that
the
process
of
development
can
not
be
determined
by
microscopic
examination
but
we
may
as
well
assume
the
presence
of
vital
units
in
the
case
of
dynamical
aggregates
as
for
professor
bastian
to
insist
upon
crystalline
units
in
the
case
of
statical
aggregates
or
crystals
both
processes
in
their
initial
stages
of
development
lie
beyond
the
reach
of
human
scrutiny
and
all
that
we
know
or
possibly
can
know
is
that
certain
inorganic
conditions
are
favorable
for
the
development
of
crystals
as
certain
organic
conditions
are
favorable
for
the
development
of
morphological
cells
beyond
this
professor
bastian
knows
nothing
we
know
nothing
professor
beale
in
his
recent
work
on
the
mystery
of
life
one
that
is
now
justly
attracting
very
wide
attention
says
between
the
two
sets
of
phenomena
physical
and
vital
not
the
faintest
analogy
can
be
shown
to
exist
the
idea
of
a
particle
of
muscular
or
nerve
tissue
being
formed
by
a
process
akin
to
crystallization
appears
ridiculous
to
any
one
who
has
studied
the
two
classes
of
phenomena
or
is
acquainted
with
the
structure
of
these
tissues
and
he
quietly
yet
effectively
ridicules
the
idea
that
the
ultimate
molecules
of
matter
substantially
the
same
matter
in
fact
have
the
power
to
arrange
themselves
independently
of
vital
tendency
alternately
into
a
or
a
according
to
the
specific
direction
they
may
take
or
the
incidence
of
conditions
they
may
undergo
in
their
primary
movement
and
for
the
benefit
of
professor
beale
behind
whose
bioplasts
we
place
the
vital
unit
not
a
variable
but
a
constant
unit
we
would
have
him
bear
in
mind
what
he
so
well
knows
that
the
finest
fibres
that
go
to
make
up
these
tissues
lie
quite
beyond
the
microscopic
limit
in
their
interlaced
and
reticulations
so
that
nothing
can
be
predicated
of
their
ultimate
contexture
any
more
than
of
the
ultimate
distribution
of
matter
itself
he
has
himself
traced
these
wonderfully
minute
under
glasses
of
the
highest
magnifying
power
and
knows
that
their
ultimate
distribution
can
not
be
reached
let
him
come
out
then
as
the
ablest
vitalist
now
living
and
boldly
assert
the
presence
of
the
and
the
instead
of
falling
back
on
his
bioplastic
spinners
and
weavers
of
tissue
which
are
only
the
servants
and
willing
workers
of
the
one
integral
unit
or
force
within
it
is
far
more
rational
and
at
the
same
time
more
accordant
with
strict
scientific
methods
to
attribute
these
muscular
and
nerve
reticulations
to
a
single
direct
cause
than
to
a
multitude
of
secondary
causes
there
is
a
difference
between
the
and
the
but
the
physical
differences
are
not
by
any
means
the
greatest
the
bioplastic
spinners
and
weavers
work
as
obediently
for
the
one
as
the
other
they
never
stop
to
inquire
how
far
they
shall
differentiate
this
vital
tissue
or
that
or
in
what
direction
even
they
shall
work
not
a
thread
is
spun
nor
a
shuttle
thrown
that
is
not
directed
by
the
one
of
vital
tissue
these
obedient
bioplasts
determine
nothing
direct
nothing
each
works
in
his
own
cell
as
obediently
as
a
all
specific
modifications
all
determinate
movements
all
molecular
arrangements
all
multiplications
of
bioplastic
force
are
the
work
of
the
one
vital
webster
or
principle
of
life
within
that
which
shapes
all
directs
all
determines
all
and
this
is
true
from
the
first
or
embryological
inception
of
the
or
germ
until
the
real
occupant
of
the
dismisses
his
bioplastic
weavers
and
lies
down
to
die
and
so
of
all
vital
units
each
determines
its
own
structural
form
and
unchangeably
retains
it
to
the
end
even
to
the
slightest
impression
of
a
scar
inflicted
years
and
years
before
the
occupant
of
this
has
dismissed
one
set
of
bioplastic
weavers
after
another
has
thrown
aside
this
spun
tissue
and
that
warp
and
woof
of
woven
texture
time
and
time
again
so
that
the
dog
of
is
not
the
same
dog
of
a
year
ago
and
yet
he
has
the
same
affection
for
his
master
carries
with
him
the
same
scar
received
twenty
years
before
in
the
chase
gives
the
same
glad
bark
of
welcome
as
his
owner
nears
home
exhibits
the
same
characteristic
wag
in
his
tail
and
lying
down
to
sleep
dreams
of
the
once
happy
chase
in
which
he
is
no
longer
able
to
engage
this
continuous
presence
of
the
same
dog
through
all
these
twenty
years
of
physical
change
the
old
dog
reappearing
in
the
new
a
dozen
times
over
is
what
we
mean
by
the
constantly
differentiating
yet
undifferentiated
those
who
attempt
to
bisect
this
vital
unit
divide
it
up
into
one
fractional
part
after
another
until
it
shall
represent
a
million
bioplastic
workers
in
as
many
different
cells
are
committing
the
same
sort
of
folly
in
principle
at
least
if
not
in
practice
as
that
which
led
the
daughters
of
pelias
to
cut
up
their
father
in
the
expectation
of
boiling
the
old
bioplasts
into
new
and
then
by
the
cunning
aid
of
medea
who
directed
the
operation
reuniting
them
into
the
one
they
so
much
delighted
to
honor
but
this
first
and
only
recorded
attempt
at
differentiating
a
vital
unit
disastrously
failed
as
the
reader
of
ancient
myths
well
knows
although
the
experiment
was
conducted
by
the
most
careful
and
loving
hands
the
necessary
chemical
to
reproduce
life
as
well
as
the
necessary
processes
of
producing
it
have
not
yet
been
ascertained
nor
is
it
likely
they
ever
will
be
and
herein
lies
the
most
marked
distinction
between
crystallizable
matter
and
living
substance
and
yet
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
vital
principle
perishes
in
the
destruction
of
its
temporary
organism
it
is
not
the
material
seed
that
germinates
but
the
vital
principle
it
contains
bursting
forth
from
its
environment
into
newness
of
life
all
that
can
be
alleged
of
either
boiled
or
calcined
seeds
is
that
the
material
substances
of
which
they
were
composed
are
so
changed
in
their
chemical
constituents
or
molecular
adjustment
that
they
are
no
longer
capable
of
developing
or
being
developed
into
a
living
organism
principles
never
die
and
this
is
as
true
of
the
vital
principles
in
nature
as
those
obtaining
in
ethics
and
morals
were
it
possible
to
restore
the
exact
chemical
conditions
and
constituent
particles
of
the
boiled
or
calcined
seed
there
is
no
more
doubt
that
nature
would
respond
to
the
environing
conditions
and
give
forth
the
proper
expression
of
than
there
is
that
crystals
of
spar
would
make
their
appearance
in
an
overcharged
bath
chemically
prepared
for
that
purpose
it
is
not
the
albuminous
substance
enclosed
in
the
seed
but
the
vital
principle
therein
that
continuously
imparted
to
nature
from
the
great
vital
fountain
of
the
universe
which
burgeons
forth
into
life
whenever
and
wherever
the
required
conditions
obtain
in
proof
of
this
statement
we
might
instance
any
number
of
cases
where
recently
abandoned
and
other
clayey
excavations
were
situated
at
considerable
distances
from
any
natural
or
ponds
from
which
spawn
could
have
been
derived
and
yet
these
excavations
have
no
sooner
been
filled
with
permanently
standing
rain
water
than
certain
small
fishes
of
the
and
other
families
have
made
their
appearance
therein
nobody
has
thought
of
stocking
these
standing
pools
of
water
with
the
fish
in
question
nor
has
there
been
any
surface
overflow
to
account
for
their
presence
nor
any
other
apparent
means
of
transportation
if
we
except
the
birds
and
they
generally
swallow
their
food
in
the
water
or
on
the
nearest
tree
to
the
point
of
capture
any
theory
accounting
for
the
presence
of
spawn
is
therefore
out
of
the
question
this
spawn
must
have
traversed
hard
clay
deposits
for
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
or
more
to
make
their
appearance
in
these
waters
the
only
possible
explanation
of
this
class
of
phenomena
and
they
are
by
no
means
infrequent
is
to
be
found
in
favoring
conditions
and
the
presence
of
vital
units
they
are
primordial
manifestations
of
life
and
such
as
would
have
made
their
appearance
in
any
corresponding
latitude
of
the
southern
hemisphere
under
the
same
favoring
conditions
and
this
is
true
of
all
living
organisms
from
the
lowest
morphological
cell
in
the
ichthyologic
world
to
the
highest
and
lordliest
conifer
that
grows
their
spawn
and
seeds
are
perishable
by
heat
but
the
vital
principle
that
organizes
them
is
as
imperishable
in
one
element
as
another
no
heated
furnace
much
less
the
experimental
flasks
of
the
physicist
will
affect
a
vital
principle
of
nature
any
more
than
a
puff
of
the
east
wind
would
shake
olympus
and
all
the
countless
myriads
of
vital
units
in
nature
are
now
manifesting
themselves
in
animal
and
vegetal
forms
under
favoring
conditions
the
same
as
in
those
epochs
of
the
world
history
when
a
more
exuberant
vegetation
prevailed
if
not
a
more
abounding
animal
life
the
same
persistent
law
of
vital
development
and
growth
has
been
present
in
all
conditions
and
circumstances
of
matter
ever
since
the
detritus
of
the
silicious
rocks
felt
the
first
influence
of
the
rains
the
dews
and
the
sunlight
then
the
earth
commenced
to
bring
forth
the
grass
the
herb
yielding
seed
and
the
yielding
fruit
after
his
kind
and
in
their
growth
was
laid
the
foundation
of
animal
life
whether
there
was
any
audible
or
inaudible
command
of
god
uttered
at
the
time
is
not
the
question
it
is
the
of
vital
growth
that
we
are
after
and
not
the
command
the
geologic
records
attest
the
fact
as
well
as
the
vital
law
and
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
with
sturdy
old
richard
hooker
that
all
law
and
especially
all
law
has
her
seat
in
the
bosom
of
god
and
her
voice
is
the
harmony
of
the
world
professor
beale
while
resolutely
combating
the
physical
hypothesis
of
life
is
not
a
little
unfortunate
in
his
use
of
scientific
terms
he
is
constantly
using
those
of
living
matter
and
dead
matter
as
if
they
contained
no
fatal
concession
to
the
materialists
with
which
to
completely
overthrow
his
own
ultimate
conclusions
as
to
life
for
he
gains
nothing
by
merely
substituting
bioplasm
and
bioplasts
for
protoplasm
and
plastide
particles
the
essential
plasma
in
both
cases
is
the
same
and
behind
each
lies
the
vital
unit
or
principle
therein
manifested
the
invisible
indestructible
germ
or
zra
of
the
bible
genesis
living
organisms
come
of
course
from
this
essential
plasma
but
without
an
elementary
principle
or
vital
unit
therein
there
would
be
no
bioplasts
in
the
sense
in
which
professor
beale
uses
this
term
these
bioplasts
are
living
organisms
which
take
up
nutrient
matter
and
convert
it
by
assimilation
into
tissues
nerves
fibres
bones
into
the
higher
and
more
complex
organs
that
go
to
make
up
living
structure
this
mysterious
transmutation
of
one
thing
into
another
as
organic
matter
into
living
organisms
is
due
to
a
vitally
implanted
principle
not
to
these
little
bioplasts
or
mere
epithelial
and
other
tools
with
which
the
vital
principle
works
to
apply
the
term
living
matter
to
the
tools
with
which
a
living
structure
is
built
up
is
to
lose
sight
of
the
using
them
for
an
apparently
intelligent
purpose
the
microscope
may
demonstrate
that
these
little
bioplasts
throb
have
life
but
there
is
no
intelligent
purpose
manifested
by
them
except
as
they
are
moved
by
an
unseen
hand
that
conclusively
directs
the
whole
structural
work
builds
up
the
one
complete
symmetrical
structure
not
its
thousand
independent
parts
having
no
relation
to
a
general
plan
the
future
lord
and
occupant
of
the
mansion
is
presumably
present
and
if
he
uses
tools
that
throb
and
have
life
it
is
because
everything
he
touches
is
quickened
into
life
that
it
may
be
the
more
obedient
to
his
will
if
this
structure
be
the
one
of
man
the
vital
principle
imparted
is
that
which
fashions
the
epithelial
tools
and
uses
them
as
well
in
laying
the
embryological
foundation
as
in
crowning
its
work
with
that
dome
of
thought
flashing
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
joseph
cook
who
enthusiastically
follows
professor
beale
in
his
theory
of
life
in
one
of
his
boston
monday
lectures
says
it
is
beyond
contradiction
that
we
know
that
these
little
points
of
structureless
matter
spin
the
threads
and
weave
the
warp
and
woof
of
organisms
with
all
due
respect
to
this
distinguished
lecturer
we
must
except
to
not
less
than
three
points
in
as
many
lines
of
his
statement
in
the
first
place
we
know
nothing
respecting
the
beginnings
of
life
which
may
not
be
contradicted
with
some
show
of
reason
take
his
own
definition
of
bioplasts
as
copied
from
professor
beale
coupled
with
what
they
both
term
nutrient
matter
and
germinal
matter
or
bioplasm
and
this
confident
assertion
of
his
will
land
him
at
once
where
the
highest
powers
of
the
microscope
fail
to
give
back
any
intelligible
answer
or
where
neither
assertion
nor
contradiction
avails
anything
a
bioplast
they
tell
us
is
a
germinal
point
in
germinal
matter
or
bioplasm
it
is
also
assumed
that
the
central
portion
of
every
cell
in
an
organic
tissue
is
a
bioplast
here
this
wonderful
little
weaver
of
tissue
sits
spinning
his
threads
and
weaving
them
into
the
warp
and
woof
of
formed
matter
that
which
according
to
professor
beale
becomes
dead
matter
as
soon
as
it
is
woven
but
it
is
admitted
that
the
nerve
fibres
constitute
an
uninterrupted
network
which
admits
of
no
endings
that
is
whose
ultimate
reticulations
lie
beyond
the
microscopic
limit
but
there
is
a
cell
in
every
hundredth
part
of
an
inch
of
these
ultimate
reticulations
in
each
of
which
one
of
these
bioplastic
weavers
sits
plying
his
threads
into
the
warp
and
woof
of
nerve
tissue
if
not
of
nerve
force
what
is
known
of
these
little
weavers
either
by
joseph
cook
or
professor
lionel
beale
manifestly
nothing
unless
they
have
been
specially
favored
with
microscopes
of
over
diameters
the
highest
yet
made
and
have
fathomed
the
ultimate
implications
of
nerve
force
an
assumption
on
the
part
of
the
boston
lecturer
to
which
we
are
bound
to
except
nor
are
these
bioplasts
mere
structureless
matter
however
minute
they
may
be
as
little
points
they
differ
only
from
morphological
cells
in
the
definitional
language
employed
by
different
theorists
and
lack
the
accuracy
of
distinction
necessary
to
scientific
classification
to
define
a
bioplast
as
a
germinal
point
in
germinal
matter
or
bioplasm
is
to
draw
no
satisfactory
line
of
distinction
between
the
two
except
that
the
one
is
a
mere
aggregation
of
the
other
a
germinal
mass
is
only
made
up
of
germinal
points
those
considered
as
the
least
of
any
given
whole
however
infinitesimal
they
may
be
in
theoretical
statement
if
any
germinal
point
in
germinal
matter
therefore
be
a
bioplast
then
every
germinal
point
to
the
extent
of
making
up
its
entire
mass
must
be
a
bioplast
and
the
distinction
between
the
two
becomes
merely
verbal
and
without
generic
signification
but
every
morphological
cell
is
conceded
to
be
an
organism
whether
it
lie
within
or
beyond
the
microscopic
limit
and
it
invariably
exhibits
a
greater
or
less
amount
of
cellular
activity
at
its
centre
it
grows
rather
than
spins
it
builds
up
tissue
rather
than
weaves
it
into
warp
and
woof
it
assimilates
nutritive
matter
rather
than
plies
a
loom
in
any
conceivable
sense
in
which
we
may
view
that
industrial
machine
no
matter
what
we
may
call
this
point
of
vital
activity
in
a
cell
whether
it
be
a
bioplast
a
plastid
a
physiological
unit
or
a
granule
of
elementary
it
simply
performs
the
one
single
function
of
life
to
which
it
is
specifically
assigned
in
the
process
of
building
up
any
one
identical
individual
of
a
species
whether
it
be
a
man
an
ape
a
tree
or
a
parasitic
fungus
the
very
admission
that
the
bioplast
spins
makes
it
an
organism
and
not
mere
structureless
matter
for
the
first
thread
it
spins
is
manifestly
for
its
own
covering
or
the
ornamentation
of
its
own
and
to
speak
of
these
as
structureless
matter
is
to
confound
all
scientific
sense
as
well
as
meaning
the
third
objection
to
cook
statement
is
that
if
bioplasts
spin
it
is
as
dependent
and
not
as
independent
machines
or
agencies
there
are
millions
of
these
bioplasts
taking
the
word
in
the
sense
in
which
professor
beale
uses
it
in
every
living
organism
considered
as
a
biological
whole
in
the
case
of
man
there
are
millions
of
them
within
a
comparatively
small
compass
and
each
has
its
own
cell
to
which
its
specific
work
is
assigned
now
these
germinal
points
or
bioplasts
in
each
of
these
myriads
of
cells
work
not
separately
and
independently
like
so
many
oysters
in
their
respective
shells
but
harmoniously
and
together
as
if
under
the
supervisional
direction
of
one
supreme
architect
and
builder
this
builder
is
that
one
elementary
principle
of
life
appertaining
to
each
specific
individual
as
a
species
with
which
nature
was
endowed
from
the
beginning
and
which
in
the
case
of
man
was
a
direct
emanation
from
deity
it
is
this
vital
principle
manifesting
itself
all
living
organisms
not
them
directing
professor
bioplastic
weavers
not
directed
by
them
availing
itself
of
necessary
plasmic
conditions
if
not
giving
rise
to
them
in
the
first
instance
observing
no
developmental
processes
by
which
one
form
of
life
laps
over
upon
another
and
following
no
order
but
that
of
universal
harmony
in
the
divine
intendment
there
is
struggle
and
rivalry
for
existence
even
among
the
same
classes
orders
genera
and
species
and
the
smallest
and
weakest
must
give
place
to
the
largest
and
strongest
everywhere
and
as
time
the
greatest
of
all
rodents
gnaws
away
at
the
mystical
tree
of
life
but
in
every
living
organism
from
the
lowest
and
simplest
to
the
highest
and
most
complex
all
bioplastic
spinners
of
filamentous
tissue
all
plastide
weavers
of
membranous
or
spun
matter
all
epithelial
and
other
anatomical
helpers
and
workers
perform
their
respective
tasks
under
the
special
supervision
we
have
named
that
is
under
the
higher
unit
of
life
they
all
work
for
the
advancement
and
of
the
higher
organism
of
which
they
form
a
component
and
necessarily
subordinate
part
the
fact
that
professor
beale
has
discovered
that
what
he
calls
bioplasm
and
germinal
points
or
bioplasts
may
take
on
a
distinct
and
separate
color
from
tissue
when
subjected
to
a
solution
of
carmine
in
ammonia
is
no
evidence
that
he
has
penetrated
the
adytum
of
this
sacred
temple
of
life
wherein
lies
the
mystery
of
mysteries
it
is
an
important
discovery
so
far
as
tracing
tissue
is
concerned
but
it
admits
him
into
no
higher
mystery
within
the
temple
built
by
god
than
another
may
attain
to
by
the
accidental
discovery
that
the
tissues
may
take
on
the
same
color
in
some
other
solution
by
no
means
an
improbable
discovery
carmine
in
ammonia
is
not
the
only
solution
that
may
aid
science
in
the
investigations
now
being
carried
forward
by
the
vitalists
and
with
so
much
bitterness
and
asperity
of
feeling
between
them
and
now
that
professor
beale
has
made
happy
discovery
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
some
other
equally
persistent
worker
in
this
interesting
field
of
inquiry
may
not
hit
upon
quite
as
happy
a
discovery
in
the
same
or
some
equivalent
direction
one
that
shall
throw
the
bioplasmic
theory
as
far
into
the
shade
as
cook
thinks
the
bioplasts
have
already
thrown
the
cells
but
decidedly
the
most
objectionable
statement
of
professor
beale
although
one
confidently
by
our
boston
monday
lecturer
is
that
which
makes
bioplasm
and
bioplasts
the
only
living
matter
we
have
already
referred
to
the
phrases
living
matter
and
matter
as
altogether
objectionable
in
biological
statement
since
they
are
more
than
concessions
to
the
materialists
who
contemptuously
order
the
vitalists
to
take
a
back
seat
in
the
discussions
now
going
forward
as
to
the
true
origin
of
life
but
the
objection
we
here
make
is
less
technical
and
touches
a
far
more
vital
point
in
the
inquiry
it
is
true
that
professor
beale
speaks
of
formed
matter
as
if
it
were
a
peculiar
something
a
sort
of
between
living
and
matter
but
he
distinctly
avers
that
the
substance
which
turns
red
in
his
carmine
solutions
is
the
only
living
matter
and
hence
asserts
inferentially
at
least
that
all
other
matter
in
any
and
every
living
organism
is
dead
matter
but
we
may
just
as
confidently
aver
that
no
matter
is
living
in
any
vital
organism
which
has
not
been
assimilated
and
built
up
into
living
membranous
tissue
capable
of
responding
in
the
case
of
man
to
his
will
as
well
as
performing
the
autonomous
functions
of
plants
and
the
lower
animals
for
all
these
membranous
tissues
are
innumerably
thronged
with
bioplasts
or
plastide
particles
not
for
the
purposes
of
obedience
to
man
will
or
of
performing
any
autonomous
function
but
simply
to
supply
the
tissues
with
the
necessary
nutrient
matter
to
make
up
for
the
constant
waste
that
is
going
on
in
a
healthy
living
organ
this
waste
is
very
much
greater
than
has
heretofore
been
supposed
so
that
the
man
or
animal
of
may
be
an
entirely
distinct
and
separate
one
considered
materially
from
that
of
a
year
or
more
ago
and
this
averment
would
have
a
decided
advantage
over
professor
beale
since
in
meeting
a
friend
we
might
be
certain
that
of
him
at
least
was
alive
while
the
other
was
industriously
at
work
to
keep
him
alive
instead
of
a
stalking
corpse
as
he
would
otherwise
be
upon
the
street
besides
it
would
obviate
the
necessity
on
the
part
of
the
vitalists
of
giving
themselves
away
to
the
materialists
as
professor
beale
virtually
does
in
the
argument
the
too
rude
touch
of
a
child
hand
will
rob
the
canary
bird
of
its
life
stifle
its
musical
throat
hush
its
most
ecstatic
note
still
its
exquisite
song
and
render
forever
mute
and
silent
its
voice
but
where
are
professor
beale
bioplasts
which
but
a
moment
before
were
not
only
weaving
the
nerves
tissues
muscles
bones
and
even
the
wonderful
plumage
of
this
canary
bird
but
plying
the
invisible
threads
of
song
throwing
off
its
chirps
carols
trills
quavers
airs
overtures
and
brilliant
as
if
the
little
vocalist
had
caught
its
inspiration
from
the
very
skies
where
we
repeat
are
these
bioplasts
now
they
are
all
quietly
and
industriously
at
work
as
before
the
occupant
of
the
is
gone
but
not
one
of
these
bioplasts
has
dropped
a
clew
thrown
down
a
shuttle
abandoned
a
loom
or
fled
in
dismay
to
the
core
of
its
cell
they
still
pulsate
throb
throw
off

no
chemical
change
has
yet
intervened
to
break
down
their
or
interfere
with
the
occupations
assigned
them
the
machinery
that
ran
their
looms
is
stopped
that
is
all
the
invisible
shuttles
have
ceased
to
ply
the
meshes
of
their
tangled
webs
are
broken
the
more
delicate
threads
of

are
snapped
in

but
the
bioplastic

and

are
all
there
not

of
them
has
been
displaced
from
its
seat
nor
in
any
way
disturbed
or

in

work
if
they
are
conscious
of
any

it
is
that
the

of

suddenly
stepped
out

no
longer

to
direct
their
tasks
the
icy
hand
of
decay
and
death
will
soon
be
upon
them
these
poor
bioplastic
weavers
of

but
the
vocal
spark
the
bright
gem
instinct
with
music
is
beyond
the
reach
of
these
dusky
messengers
it
is
not
man
but
the
giver
of
all

we
only
know
when
our
faith
is
uplifted
by
inspiration
that
the
soul
of
music
never
dies
nor
slumbers
in
its
shell

from

decidedly
brilliant
vital
theories
which
have
been
advanced
within
the
last
few
years
is
that
which
makes
life
an
undiscovered
correlative
of
force
those
who
have
the
reputation
of
being
the
profoundest
thinkers
and
delvers
in
the
realm
of
in
europe
and
who
have
more
or
less
modestly
contributed
to
that
reputation
themselves
have
evidently
thought
to
eclipse
if
not
to
entirely
throw
into
the
shade
the
great
exploit
of
leverrier
in
pointing
out
the
exact
place
in
their
empirical
heavens
where
the
superior
optics
of
some
future
observer
shall
behold
in
all
its
glory
this
undiscovered
correlative
of
force
which
they
have
indicated
as
lying
within
the
higher
possibilities
and
potentialities
of
matter
precisely
what
they
mean
by
this
undiscovered
correlate
is
what
puzzles
us
quite
as
much
to
determine
as
it
does
the
materialists
to
explain
were
they
to
define
life
as
an
undiscovered
force
simply
their
definition
would
manifestly
lack
in
brilliancy
what
it
would
conclusively
make
up
in
precision
and
accuracy
of
definitional
statement
but
such
a
poor
metaphrastic
and
exposition
of
vital
force
would
never
answer
the
necessities
of
that
profounder
profundity
required
for
the
success
of
modern
scientific
treatises
hence
the
interpolation
of
this
correlative
of
theirs
let
us
ascertain
if
we
can
what
it
means
since
they
are
so
chary
of
informing
us
themselves
a
correlate
of
a
thing
any
thing
simply
implies
the
reciprocal
relation
it
bears
to
some
other
thing
as
a
cognate
term
it
expresses
nothing
can
express
nothing
but
reciprocity
of
relationship
such
as
father
to
son
brother
to
sister
uncle
to
aunt
nephews
to
nieces
etc
as
applied
to
vital
force
it
means
nothing
more
nor
less
than
that
this
particular
force
stands
in
some
sort
of
relationship
to
the
other
forces
of
nature
or
as
they
would
have
us
believe
the
forces
of
nature
and
the
simple
strength
or
potentiality
of
this
relationship
is
what
makes
all
the
difference
between
the
severally
related
forces
of
the
universe
since
it
would
be
as
impossible
to
differentiate
a
fixed
relationship
as
to
change
the
nature
of
vital
units
but
whether
vital
force
as
a
distinct
correlate
is
paternal
or
filial
brotherly
or
sisterly
avuncular
or
amital
in
its
relationship
is
not
stated
the
scientific
formula
however
may
be
stated
thus
as
a
chemical
force
is
to
b
molecular
force
so
is
c
a
third
known
force
to
the
vital
or
unknown
force
so
that
by
multiplying
the
antecedents
and
consequents
together
and
eliminating
the
value
of
we
may
mathematically
obtain
the
value
of
vital
force
but
to
eliminate
the
value
of
is
what
troubles
them
herbert
spencer
has
tried
his
hand
at
it
but
failed
to
express
life
under
any
higher
correlation
than
molecular
force
nor
can
he
definitely
inform
us
whether
either
force
is
third
or
fourth
cousin
to
the
other
but
he
manifestly
regards
their
relationship
as
constituting
either
a
very
attractive
or
highly
repulsive
force
in
his
vexation
at
not
finding
the
value
of
he
is
driven
from
mathematical
to
mechanical
biology
and
gives
us
this
new
definitional
value
of
life
that
singularly
contumacious
quantity
which
so
persistently
refuses
to
be
eliminated
in
scientific
equations
life
is
molecular
machinery
worked
by
molecular
force
but
as
professor
beale
has
utterly
demoralized
if
not
demolished
this
machinery
in
his
recent
treatise
on
the
mystery
of
life
we
will
spare
it
any
further
blows
and
proceed
to
the
consideration
of
molecular
force
before
we
proceed
however
to
the
consideration
of
this
force
let
us
definitely
understand
the
meaning
of
the
terms
we
shall
be
called
upon
to
use
we
can
have
no
difficulty
in
understanding
the
meaning
of
molecular
attraction
or
that
force
acting
immediately
on
the
integrant
molecules
or
particles
of
a
body
as
distinguished
from
the
attraction
of
gravitation
which
acts
at
unlimited
distances
but
when
it
comes
to
ascribing
other
and
higher
manifestations
of
power
to
molecules
such
as
have
not
been
scientifically
shown
to
exist
we
must
feel
our
way
with
caution
and
demand
of
these
pretentious
molecules
or
rather
of
their
materialistic
backers
a
reason
for
the
faith
or
rather
force
that
is
in
them
it
is
agreed
by
all
physicists
as
well
as
chemists
that
a
molecule
is
the
smallest
conceivable
quantity
of
a
simple
or
compound
substance
as
an
atom
is
the
smallest
conceivable
quantity
of
an
element
which
enters
into
combination
with
other
elements
to
form
material
substance
for
instance
the
smallest
conceivable
quantity
of
water
is
a
molecule
while
the
smallest
conceivable
quantity
of
either
of
the
two
elements
of
which
water
is
composed
is
an
atom
in
every
molecule
of
water
therefore
there
are
three
elementary
atoms
two
of
hydrogen
and
one
of
oxygen
and
since
a
molecule
as
a
general
rule
contains
two
or
more
atoms
and
may
contain
many
of
them
why
not
predicate
dynamic
force
of
the
atoms
which
lie
one
step
nearer
the
elementary
forces
of
nature
for
the
mightiest
forces
of
nature
lie
in
these
elements
when
forced
into
unnatural
alliances
or
chained
up
in
durance
vile
it
is
in
the
elements
of
matter
and
not
in
its
molecules
that
this
tremendous
dynamic
force
resides
man
knowing
this
harnesses
them
into
his
service
first
by
forcing
them
into
unnatural
alliances
as
in
the
case
of
charcoal
sulphur
and
saltpetre
and
then
successfully
pitting
them
in
conflict
against
the
rocks
and
the
general
inertia
of
matter
to
charge
all
the
destructive
work
they
do
on
the
innocent
and
harmless
molecules
which
are
two
steps
removed
from
the
actual
force
expended
is
drawing
conclusions
from
the
sheerest
hypothetical
data
it
is
the
office
of
molecular
force
if
there
is
any
meaning
to
the
term
beyond
what
is
expressed
by
molecular
attraction
to
conserve
matter
bind
rocks
together
not
rend
them
in
sunder
if
the
dynamic
forces
of
nature
lie
pent
up
in
the
molecules
then
man
must
array
molecular
force
against
molecular
force
in
order
to
rend
rocks
and
tear
mountains
in
sunder
this
theory
of
molecular
force
as
extended
to
vital
physics
in
the
of
life
is
irreconcilably
at
war
with
the
principal
phenomena
of
life
and
should
be
classed
with
the
other
undiscovered
correlates
of
force
which
professor
beale
speaks
of
as
the
fictions
of
a
mechanical
imagination
the
truth
is
that
these
much
abused
and
much
slandered
molecules
are
the
most
innocent
and
harmless
things
in
nature
they
never
become
destructive
unless
some
other
force
than
that
inhering
in
themselves
drags
them
into
its
service
and
hurls
them
along
a
devastating
path
of
themselves
they
are
the
very
quintessence
of
quiessence
in
the
universe
and
when
formed
in
nature
laboratory
at
once
seek
quiet
and
loving
companionship
with
kindred
molecules
and
retain
it
forever
afterwards
the
idea
that
they
should
break
away
from
their
loving
molecular
embrace
and
by
any
process
of
differentiation
or
constructive
agency
of
their
own
seek
an
alliance
with
some
living
in
order
to
be
built
up
into
living
presents
about
as
perverse
and
wayward
an
impulse
on
the
part
of
matter
as
can
well
be
imagined
by
the
scientific
mind
that
the
should
seek
to
get
hold
of
and
differentiate
them
we
can
well
understand
the
circean
witchery
and
enticement
is
all
on
the
part
of
the
not
in
the
inclination
of
the
molecules
if
there
is
any
truth
in
this
of
life
it
is
about
time
for
us
to
discard
some
of
the
old
categories
respecting
matter
motion
and
life
and
substitute
new
ones
in
their
place
in
the
multiplicity
of
new
scientific
terms
constantly
springing
up
for
recognition
in
these
days
there
ought
to
be
no
difficulty
in
expressing
the
true
categories
and
assigning
to
them
their
proper
definitional
value
to
include
physical
force
chemical
force
molecular
force
and
vital
force
all
under
one
and
the
same
category
and
then
interpret
their
several
modes
of
action
on
any
theory
of
is
not
emancipating
language
from
the
gross
thraldom
into
which
their
molecular
machinery
has
driven
it
besides
there
is
moral
force
mental
force
the
force
of
will
the
force
of
reason
the
force
of
honesty
the
force
of
fraud
and
any
number
of
other
forces
all
possessing
more
or
less
impetus
or
momentum
and
capable
of
binding
or
coercing
persons
and
things
in
all
their
diversified
relations
correlations
incidences
coincidences
affinities
antagonisms
and
so
on
through
an
interminable
chapter
of
interchangeable
predications
all
these
different
expressions
of
force
are
to
be
tethered
together
definitionally
bound
hand
and
foot
under
the
one
explanatory
head
of
we
protest
against
the
labor
of
thus
unifying
all
the
natural
forces
of
the
universe
even
if
it
were
practicable
under
scientific
methods
but
professor
tyndall
denies
that
molecular
groupings
and
molecular
motions
explain
anything
account
for
anything
in
the
way
of
explicating
or
determining
what
life
is
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
cite
a
stronger
and
more
determined
materialist
as
authority
on
the
point
we
are
considering
he
says
if
love
were
known
to
be
associated
with
a
spiral
motion
of
the
molecules
of
the
brain
and
hate
with
the
we
should
remain
as
ignorant
as
before
as
to
the
cause
of
motion
but
there
is
no
proof
that
the
molecules
of
the
brain
manifest
any
other
motions
than
those
necessary
for
keeping
up
the
normal
condition
of
health
and
vital
activity
in
the
brain
itself
no
one
can
be
certain
that
he
has
seen
these
molecules
in
a
state
of
mental
activity
for
where
portions
of
the
human
brain
have
been
exposed
to
microscopic
examination
even
in
perfect
states
of
consciousness
on
the
part
of
those
whose
brains
have
been
laid
bare
there
can
be
no
certainty
that
the
molecular
action
if
any
is
referable
to
one
set
of
movements
more
than
another
and
even
in
the
case
of
animalcules
as
seen
in
the
object
glass
of
the
microscope
there
is
no
absolute
certainty
that
their
quick
darting
or
jerking
movements
are
due
to
any
as
heretofore
assumed
some
quite
as
well
defined
forms
are
entirely
motionless
and
if
all
were
so
it
would
be
idle
to
predicate
vitality
of
them
these
infinitessimal
and
constantly
varying
forms
many
of
them
not
the
one
part
of
an
inch
in
length
to
say
nothing
of
their
other
dimensions
may
owe
their
oscillations
wave
movements
darting
and
other
manifestations
and
even
their
molecular
arrangements
and
rearrangements
to
other
causes
than
those
strictly
vital
and
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
their
actual
movements
are
just
as
much
exaggerated
under
the
microscope
as
their
real
dimensions
but
as
they
make
their
appearance
in
organic
infusions
only
they
are
presumably
vital
organisms
rather
than
fomentative
or
mere
filamentous
professor
huxley
while
conceding
that
molecular
changes
may
take
place
under
environing
or
in
protoplasmic
matter
denies
that
the
primordial
cells
possesses
in
any
degree
the
characteristics
of
a
machine
nor
can
they
undergo
any
differentiating
process
by
which
the
character
of
their
manifestations
can
be
changed
and
he
even
denies
to
them
the
poor
right
to
originate
or
in
any
way
modify
their
own
plasma
he
says
they
are
no
more
the
producers
of
vital
phenomena
than
the
shells
scattered
in
orderly
line
along
the
are
the
instruments
by
which
the
gravitative
force
of
the
moon
acts
upon
the
ocean
like
these
the
cells
mark
only
where
the
vital
tides
have
been
and
how
they
have
acted
this
is
undoubtedly
true
of
all
cells
in
which
the
vital
or
functional
office
has
ceased
as
in
the
case
of
professor
beale
formed
matter
the
cells
are
the
result
of
the
vital
principle
that
lies
behind
them
and
simply
indicate
where
life
exists
or
has
manifestly
ceased
to
exist
where
the
vital
currents
have
ceased
to
flow
the
wreck
of
primordial
cells
is
quite
as
wide
and
disastrous
as
where
millions
of
have
been
strewn
along
a
desolated
and
they
all
come
both
the
cells
and
shells
from
the
preëxisting
vital
units
or
determinate
germs
that
fall
into
their
own
incidences
of
movement
without
any
concurrence
of
physical
conditions
beyond
their
own
inherent
tendency
to
development
for
conditions
do
not
determine
life
they
only
favor
its
manifestation
but
some
of
the
materialists
claim
that
what
we
call
vital
units
or
invisible
indestructible
germs
are
at
best
only
physical
relations
that
they
have
nothing
more
than
a
hypothetical
existence
without
any
independent
recognizable
quality
justifying
our
conclusions
respecting
them
but
may
not
this
identical
language
be
retortively
suggested
in
the
case
of
their
correlates
of
force
what
more
than
a
hypothetical
existence
have
they
certainly
their
enthusiasm
to
get
rid
of
all
vital
conditions
or
manifestations
is
quite
as
marked
a
feature
in
their
speculations
respecting
life
as
any
enthusiasm
we
have
shown
in
the
verification
of
vital
phenomena
on
the
established
law
of
cause
and
effect
they
insist
upon
this
law
in
the
case
of
statical
aggregates
and
even
assign
absolute
identity
of
attributes
but
when
it
comes
to
dynamical
aggregates
they
fall
back
on
partial
identity
only
and
deny
the
presence
of
the
law
altogether
nor
are
they
any
more
felicitous
in
their
treatment
of
other
points
in
controversy
in
speaking
of
his
plastide
particles
professor
bastian
the
most
defiant
challenger
of
vitalistic
propositions
now
living
says
certain
of
these
particles
through
default
of
conditions
never
actually
develop
into
higher
modes
of
being
here
he
makes
the
absence
of
necessary
conditions
the
cause
of
while
he
stoutly
denies
that
the
presence
of
such
conditions
give
rise
to
the
development
of
a
vital
unit
and
yet
strange
to
say
he
speaks
of
the
elemental
origin
of
living
matter
as
having
probably
taken
place
on
the
surface
of
our
globe
since
the
period
when
such
matter
was
first
engendered
but
how
his
of
external
conditions
acting
upon
matter
can
engender
matter
is
one
of
those
related
heterogenetic
phenomena
which
he
does
not
condescend
to
explain
it
is
by
this
sort
of
scientific
verbiage
that
he
gets
rid
of
the
vital
principle
or
germinal
principle
of
life
which
the
biblical
genesis
declares
to
be
in
the
earth
itself
to
be
entirely
consistent
with
himself
he
should
deny
the
existence
of
this
germinal
principle
in
the
seeds
of
plants
themselves
and
insist
upon
the
of
external
conditions
as
the
cause
of
all
in
the
vegetal
as
in
the
animal
world
there
can
be
no
inherent
tendency
he
should
insist
in
the
seed
itself
towards
structural
development
but
only
external
conditions
acting
upon
dead
matter
in
heterogentic
directions
the
shooting
down
of
the
radicle
or
undeveloped
root
and
the
springing
up
of
the
plumule
or
undeveloped
stalk
is
accordingly
due
to
no
vital
principle
in
the
seed
but
to
the
complexity
or
entanglement
of
the
molecules
wrapped
up
in
their
integumentary
environment
and
this
or
some
similar
fortuitous
entanglement
of
molecules
should
account
for
all
as
well
as
all
in
nature
these
molecular
entanglements
should
therefore
be
infinite
in
number
as
well
as
in
fortuitous
complexity
to
account
for
all
the
myriad
forms
of
life
engendered
from
dead
matter
in
the
material
universe
for
if
there
is
any
one
thing
that
the
materialists
insist
upon
more
resolutely
than
another
it
is
the
fortuitousness
of
nature
the
happening
by
chance
of
whatever
she
does
formerly
it
used
to
be
the
fortuitous
concourse
of
atoms
now
it
is
the
fortuitous
aggregate
of
molecules
by
what
accidental
or
fortuitous
happening
the
atoms
have
dropped
out
of
their
scientific
categories
and
the
molecules
have
been
advanced
to
their
commanding
place
in
is
one
of
those
unassignable
causes
in
which
they
apparently
so
much
delight
we
can
only
account
for
it
on
the
supposition
that
they
have
all
become
worshippers
of
that
blind
and
accidental
greek
goddess
who
bore
the
horn
of
amalthea
and
plentifully
endowed
her
followers
with
a
wealth
of
language
and
other
gifts
but
not
with
the
most
desirable
knack
at
disposing
of
them
the
true
cause
of
vital
phenomena
manifestly
depends
on
these
two
conditions
the
presence
of
the
specific
vital
unit
and
the
necessary
environing
plasma
or
nutrient
matter
for
its
primary
development
without
the
presence
of
both
of
these
conditions
or

there
can

and
we
do
not
see
that
anything
is
gained
even
in
the

of
scientific
nomenclature
by
merely
substituting
molecular
force
for
vital

in
the
explication
of

phenomena
even
granting
that
molecular

do
take
place
during
the

of

in

it
by

follows
that
these

are
not

it
rather
than
on

they
the

should
always
subordinate
the

as

it

no

this

to
use
a
better
french
expression
than

and
they
can
fight
the
materialists
off
their
own

anywhere
the
one
sublime
verity
of
the

is
that
life
exists
and
that
it
has
existed
from
all
eternity
in
the
divine

and
in

alone
if
materialistic
science
is
disposed
to
butt
its

it

the

will
stand

to
the

may
press
her

into

many

are
to

and
command
them
to

and
find

the

of

but
the
forever
narrowing
circle
in

direction
and
the
forever
widening
one
in

other
would
utterly
baffle
all
their
attempted
research
whether
they
descended
into
the
microscopic
world
with
its
conditions
of
life
or
passed
upward
and
outward
in
to
the
irresolvable
nebulæ
where
other
and
perhaps
brighter
stars
might
burst
upon
their
view
gleaming
coldly
and
silently
down
the
still
enormous
fissures
and
chasms
in
the
heavens
the
result
would
be
the
same
wider
and
wider
fields
of
observation
might
open
upon
their
view
as
the
stellar
swarms
thickened
and
the
power
of
human
vision
failed
but
the
uranological
expedition
would
return
no
wiser
than
when
it
started
and
science
would
still
be
confronted
with
the
same
illimitability
of
space
the
same
infinitude
of
matter
and
the
same
incomprehensibility
of
the
intelligence
that
lies
beyond
for
he
who
hath
garnished
the
heavens
by
his
spirit
who
divideth
the
sea
with
his
power
and
hangeth
the
earth
upon
nothing
back
the
face
of
his
throne
and
spreadeth
his
cloud
upon
what
if
in
one
direction
we
should
find
those
inconceivably
small
specks
or
mere
bioplastic
points
which
we
call
living
matter
or
in
the
other
direction
those
inconceivably
vast
masses
which
we
call
dead
matter
who
shall
say
that
the
secret
places
of
the
most
high
are
not
hidden
from
us
or
that
when
the
spirit
of
god
first
moved
through
these
vast
fissures
and
chasms
in
the
heavens
upon
the
face
of
all
matter
there
was
not
imparted
to
it
that
animating
principle
of
life
of
which
the
biblical
genesis
speaks
and
which
we
everywhere
see
manifesting
itself
in
nature
surely
this
inquiry
is
not
one
to
be
superciliously
set
aside
by
the
materialists
after
the
failure
of
their
uranological
expedition
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
furnish
food
enough
for
scientific
contemplation
without
such
physiological
fancies
as
their
specialists
have
been
giving
us
in
the
shape
of
and
molecular
theories
of
life
but
speaking
of
the
higher
forces
as
subordinating
the
lower
suggests
that
there
should
be
something
more
definitely
explained
regarding
the
hypothesis
of
differentiation
on
which
herbert
spencer
hangs
so
much
of
his
mathematical
faith
in
the
true
explication
of
vital
phenomena
the
term
differentiation
is
not
so
formidable
as
it
might
seem
to
the
general
reader
at
first
sight
as
applied
to
physiological
problems
it
should
have
the
same
determinate
value
in
expressing
functional
differences
as
in
the
higher
operations
of
mathematics
nothing
can
of
course
differentiate
itself
nor
can
any
two
things
differentiate
each
other
even
when
functionally
allied
the
actual
coëfficient
sought
is
the
difference
effected
in
functional
value
in
one
of
two
independent
variables
for
all
formulæ
in
differentiation
are
constructed
on
the
hypothesis
that
only
one
of
two
variables
suffers
change
the
differential
coëfficient
has
yet
to
be
determined
which
shall
express
the
developmental
changes
in
two
variables
at
once
when
therefore
we
attempt
to
extend
the
formulæ
of
differentiation
to
plant
and
animal
life
we
are
confronted
by
a
very
formidable
difficulty
at
the
outset
the
impossibility
of
determining
an
invariable
coëfficient
for
any
two
variables
besides
all
attempts
at
differentiating
an
into
anything
else
than
an
would
be
as
impossible
as
to
multiply
or
divide
cabbages
by
turnips
or
sparrows
by
sparrowhawks
such
divisions
would
give
us
no
quotients
any
more
than
their
differentiations
would
give
us
a
coëfficient
physiological
differentiation
will
therefore
never
help
us
out
of
fixed
species
or
nearly
allied
types
we
can
bridge
no
specific
differences
by
it
in
the
differentiation
of
the
horse
and
the
ass
for
instance
the
superior
blood
will
predominate
in
the
preservation
of
types
and
even
the
mule
will
kick
against
further
differentiation
nature
would
so
utterly
abhor
the
practice
as
resolutely
to
slam
the
door
in
spencer
face
if
the
obstinacy
of
the
mule
did
not
kick
it
off
its
hinges
and
nature
would
be
quite
as
intractable
in
the
case
of
another
of
spencer
redoubtable
phrases
this
term
is
quite
recent
in
its
application
to
animate
objects
nor
has
it
been
long
applied
to
inanimate
it
is
claimed
to
be
a
recently
discovered
force
and
is
one
that
the
materialists
have
seized
upon
as
the
herculean
club
with
which
to
smite
all
vital
theories
to
the
earth
its
meaning
so
far
as
it
has
any
is
not
difficult
to
get
at
the
simplest
way
to
explain
it
however
is
the
best
the
reader
is
to
understand
that
when
he
rubs
two
flat
sticks
together
the
heat
thereby
engendered
is
not
the
result
of
friction
as
all
the
world
has
heretofore
supposed
but
that
the
amount
of
force
expended
in
rubbing
the
stick
against
the
stick
is
by
some
law
of
versability
not
defined
transferred
to
the
two
sticks
and
gets
so
entangled
between
their
surfaces
that
it
can
only
reappear
in
another
and
altogether
different
kind
of
force
when
it
leaves
the
hands
and
passes
into
the
two
sticks
it
is
as
the
materialists
assert
vital
force
but
as
no
force
can
be
annihilated
the
conclusive
assumption
is
that
it
still
exists
somewhere
all
of
it
in
the
first
place
went
into
the
two
flat
sticks
and
when
there
to
be
vital
some
of
it
disappeared
of
course
in
overcoming
the
inertia
of
the
sticks
but
the
bulk
of
it
became
entangled
with
the
superficial
molecules
of
the
two
sticks
and
reappeared
as
another
name
for
molecular
force
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
differentiation
of
vital
force
into
molecular
force
and
but
by
what
process
of
rubbing
under
this
law
of
versability
molecular
force
can
be
reversed
or
differentiated
back
into
vital
force
spencer
has
not
condescended
to
inform
us
the
simple
truth
is
and
the
materialists
will
be
forced
to
admit
it
in
the
end
that
there
is
no
verification
of
this
theory
beyond
that
of
mere
for
instance
it
has
been
experimentally
determined
that
a
certain
amount
of
fuel
expended
in
heat
is
equivalent
to
a
certain
amount
of
mechanical
force
not
mechanical
as
carnot
puts
it
for
force
is
not
expended
in
work
until
it
is
actually
generated
and
the
amount
generated
not
that
expended
in
work
is
the
real
equivalence
of
the
heat
produced
from
fuel
another
problem
is
presented
when
it
comes
to
determining
the
amount
of
generated
force
necessary
to
run
a
piece
of
machinery
which
shall
accomplish
a
given
amount
of
mechanical
work
a
far
better
phrase
to
express
this
equivalence
of
force
has
been
suggested
and
used
by
several
writers
in
what
is
called
the
transmutation
of
force
for
there
is
no
correlation
or
reciprocal
relation
between
heat
as
originally
produced
by
the
consumption
of
fuel
and
the
force
as
engendered
in
steam
before
it
is
transmuted
into
work
nor
is
there
any
real
equivalence
as
between
the
two
forces
after
its
transmutation
a
very
large
per
centage
of
heat
is
lost
in
its
transmutation
from
a
latent
form
in
fuel
to
an
active
or
available
form
in
steam
and
a
still
greater
loss
in
its
transmission
into
work
by
machinery
theoretically
there
may
be
such
an
equivalence
as
that
named
but
practically
it
is
impossible
to
realize
it
and
a
theory
that
is
impossible
of
realization
is
of
no
practical
utility
in
itself
and
of
little
value
as
the
basis
of
further
theory
if
then
the
theory
of
force
equivalence
is
a
failure
in
practical
application
it
furnishes
a
very
poor
basis
on
which
to
predicate
or
the
doctrine
of
reciprocal
forces
it
is
estimated
for
instance
that
a
pound
weight
falling
seven
hundred
and
feet
will
in
striking
the
earth
impart
to
it
a
degree
of
heat
equivalent
to
raising
one
pound
of
water
but
the
heat
thus
imparted
can
never
be
so
utilized
as
to
raise
a
pound
weight
seven
hundred
and
feet
into
the
air
this
shows
that
there
is
no
actual
reciprocity
of
relationship
between
the
force
as
originally
engendered
and
finally
expended
in
work
nor
can
it
be
shown
that
the
original
force
is
transmuted
or
changed
into
another
and
different
kind
of
force
by
the
operation
the
force
generated
and
the
force
expended
are
essentially
one
and
the
same
as
much
so
as
that
transmitted
from
the
power
to
the
weight
by
means
of
a
rope
and
pulley
and
the
quality
of
the
force
is
not
changed
whether
the
weight
be
lifted
by
machinery
or
the
human
hand
force
in
its
mechanical
sense
is
that
power
which
produces
motion
or
an
alteration
in
the
direction
of
motion
and
is
incapable
of
being
specialized
except
in
a
highly
figurative
sense
into
a
thousand
and
one
correlates
of
motion
but
these
miscellaneous
and
figurative
forces
are
not
what
we
are
considering
the
doctrine
of
takes
no
such
wide
and
comprehensive
sweep
it
embraces
neither
the
force
of
wit
nor
the
force
of
folly
but
mechanical
force
and
its
equivalents
the
force
exercised
by
the
human
hand
in
lifting
a
weight
either
with
or
without
rope
and
pulley
is
in
every
definitional
sense
of
the
word
mechanical
force
for
the
arm
and
hand
are
only
the
implements
or
mechanical
contrivances
of
nature
by
which
the
transmutes
itself
into
work
or
more
properly
speaking
transmits
itself
from
the
point
of
to
that
of
and
this
is
precisely
the
office
performed
by
all
mechanical
contrivances
for
the
transmission
not
transmutation
of
force
and
the
most
perfect
machine
is
that
which
transmits
the
engendered
force
with
the
least
possible
waste
or
abandonment
to
its
point
of
ultimate
expenditure
in
work
all
these
hypothetical
correlates
of
force
therefore
predicated
upon
the
doctrine
of
have
no
foundation
in
fact
since
the
force
transmitted
from
the
point
of
generation
to
the
point
of
expenditure
undergoes
no
change
but
that
of
direction
in
its
passage
along
rope
wire
belt
pulley
shafting
etc
a
man
whose
limbs
have
been
paralyzed
may
still
will
to
remove
mountains
the
is
the
same
but
the
mechanical
contrivances
for
its
transmission
are
wanting
of
the
actual
point
or
centre
of
this
in
the
case
of
the
we
know
nothing
but
the
moment
the
power
is
started
on
its
way
towards
the
point
of
whether
it
traverses
the
nerves
and
tissues
of
the
brain
or
the
right
arm
or
the
left
or
a
crowbar
or
pickaxe
it
is
in
no
sense
distinguishable
from
the
force
that
traverses
a
rope
and
pulley
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
it
undergoes
molecular
changes
or
becomes
modified
or
conditioned
by
any
nearly
or
remotely
related
force
as
it
darts
along
the
nerves
runs
through
the
contracted
tissues
electrifies
the
crowbar
or
flashes
into
work
from
the
point
of
a
pickaxe
whatever
produces
or
tends
to
produce
motion
or
an
alteration
in
its
direction
is
mechanical
force
no
matter
from
what
it
may
start
when
we
can
definitely
determine
the
centre
of
vital
force
as
exercised
in
building
up
vital
structure
in
wielding
it
is
to
be
hoped
we
shall
be
able
to
distinguish
by
the
proper
correlates
vital
force
from
that
which
is
mechanical
but
the
task
is
manifestly
a
hopeless
one
with
the
materialists
professor
beale
positively
denies
that
there
are
any
such
physical
as
those
claimed
by
the
materialists
and
asserts
that
vital
force
bears
no
relation
or
correlation
to
either
chemical
or
physical
force
that
the
one
is
a
distinct
and
separate
factor
from
the
other
and
can
not
be
interpreted
in
the
same
he
says
the
idea
of
motion
or
heat
or
light
or
electricity
or
up
or
any
texture
capable
of
fulfilling
a
definite
purpose
seems
absurd
and
opposed
to
all
that
is
known
and
yet
is
the
notion
continually
forced
upon
us
that
vitality
which
does
construct
is
but
a
correlate
of
ordinary
energy
or
motion
but
after
devoting
so
much
time
to
and
the
advocates
of
may
feel
themselves
neglected
if
we
dismiss
their
favorite
hobby
without
further
notice
the
precise
parentage
of
this
term
is
disputed
but
it
has
any
number
of
fathers
we
have
spoken
of
the
size
of
the
molecules
themselves
and
the
numbers
of
them
that
might
be
huddled
together
on
the
point
of
a
cambric
needle
without
jostling
let
us
now
consider
the
size
of
a
molecular
machine
for
each
molecule
runs
its
own
machine
and
is
provident
enough
to
see
that
they
do
not
jostle
in
fact
it
is
a
very
nice
question
in
physics
whether
the
machines
do
not
run
the
molecules
instead
of
the
prevailing
opposite
opinion
that
the
molecules
run
the
machines
unfortunately
the
question
is
one
that
can
never
be
determined
the
requisite
scientific
data
will
forever
be
wanting
but
professor
james
maxwell
now
or
quite
recently
filling
the
chair
of
experimental
physics
in
the
university
of
cambridge
england
has
furnished
us
with
calculations
on
the
strength
of
his
approximations
we
will
proceed
to
consider
the
dimensions
of
these
wonderful
little
machines
and
first
it
may
be
axiomatically
laid
down
that
these
molecular
machines
which
either
run
the
molecules
or
are
run
by
them
can
never
exceed
the
size
of
their
respective
molecules
conceding
then
that
each
one
of
these
machines
exactly
fits
into
its
own
molecule
so
as
to
present
identically
the
same
dimensions
as
well
as
their
largest
possible
dimensions
it
would
require
two
millions
of
them
placed
in
a
row
to
make
one
millimetre
or
the
one
three
hundred
and
thousandths
of
an
inch
in
length
or
seven
hundred
and
billions
of
them
to
make
one
inch
who
will
ever
be
staggered
at
after
this
and
who
will
deny
that
an
infinite
world
lies
below
the
point
of
our
microscopic
vision
if
not
an
infinite
kingdom
and
throne
beyond
our
telescopic
glance
but
following
the
same
high
authority
in
experimental
physics
let
us
consider
the
aggregate
weight
of
these
molecular
machines
we
will
not
marshal
their
aggregate
numbers
in
a
row
for
an
array
of
forty
billions
of
them
would
make
too
insignificant
a
figure
for
inspection
but
simply
give
their
actual
weight
as
computed
under
the
french
or
metric
system
take
then
a
million
million
million
million
of
these
machines
throwing
in
molecules
and
all
and
they
will
weigh
if
there
is
no
indiscreet
kicking
of
the
beam
just
a
fraction
between
four
and
five
grammes
or
to
differentiate
the
weights
a
small
fraction
over
of
an
ounce
but
why
not
get
down
to
the
atoms
of
which
the
molecules
are
only
the
theoretical
congeries
and
marshal
the
atomic
forces
into
line
these
embryonic
atoms
are
much
the
braver
warriors
and
when
summoned
to
do
battle
spring
lithe
and
against
the
elemental
foe
they
are
no
cowardly
molecules
these
atoms
but
make
war
against
titans
as
well
as
titanic
thrones
and
powers
the
elements
recognize
them
as
their
body
guardsmen
their
corps
of
invincible
lancers
their
bravest
and
best
soldiers
in
fight
and
they
are
wholly
indifferent
as
to
the
legions
of
molecules
arrayed
against
them
and
would
as
soon
hurl
a
mountain
of
them
into
the
sea
as
to
sport
with
a
zephyr
or
caper
with
the
east
wind
why
not
summon
these
countless
myriads
of
bright
and
invincible
spearmen
to
batter
down
the
walls
of
this
cretan
labyrinth
of
life
an
army
of
these
would
be
worth
all
the
molecules
that
professor
maxwell
could
array
in
line
in
a
thousand
years
no
need
remain
unsolved
with
their
bright
spears
to
drive
the
tenebrious
mists
before
them
even
professor
tyndall
of
primordial
haze
would
be
ignominiously
scattered
in
flight
before
these
atomic
legions
let
our
materialistic
friends
summon
them
then
to
their
aid
the
field
of
controversy
will
never
be
won
by
their
molecular
hessians
the
ineffably
bright
lancers
that
stand
guard
over
the
elemental
hosts
are
the
light
brigade
with
which
to
rout
the
vitalistic
enemy
advance
them
then
to
the
front
and
beneath
the
shadowy
wing
of
pestilence
or
some
other
appalling
ensign
of
destruction
the
abashed
vital
squadrons
will
flee
in
dismay
but
let
us
pass
from
scientific
speculations
to
alleged
scientific
facts
in
a
paper
read
by
hughes
bennett
before
the
royal
society
of
edinburgh
in
its
author
says
the
first
step
in
the
process
of
organic
formation
is
the
production
of
an
organic
fluid
the
second
the
precipitation
of
organic
molecules
from
which
according
to
the
molecular
law
of
growth
all
other
textures
are
derived
either
directly
or
indirectly
here
again
the
molecules
and
not
the
elementary
atoms
are
advanced
to
the
front
and
not
a
little
anxiety
is
shown
in
a
definitional
way
to
identify
vital
processes
of
growth
with
crystalline
processes
of
formation
but
bennett
entirely
mistakes
as
well
as
misstates
the
process
of
vital
development
if
he
does
not
overlook
the
law
governing
the
formation
of
crystals
there
can
be
no
symmetrically
arranged
solids
in
an
inorganic
fluid
without
the
presence
of
some
law
or
principle
definitely
determining
not
the
precipitation
but
the
formation
of
crystals
the
inorganic
particles
are
not
precipitated
or
thrown
downward
any
more
than
they
are
sublevated
or
thrown
upward
the
process
is
one
of
formation
not
precipitation
every
crystallographer
not
hampered
by
materialistic
views
and
theories
admits
the
presence
of
a
fixed
and
determinate
law
governing
each
crystalline
system
whatever
may
be
the
homologous
parts
or
the
unequal
axes
it
represents
and
so
of
the
equally
undeviating
law
of
vital
growth
life
comes
from
no
mere
precipitation
of
organic
molecules
as
bennett
would
have
us
believe
if
so
what
is
it
that
precipitates
the
molecules
they
can
hardly
be
said
to
precipitate
themselves
to
precipitate
in
a
chemical
sense
is
to
be
thrown
down
or
caused
to
be
thrown
down
as
a
substance
from
its
solution
what
then
causes
the
molecules
to
be
thus
precipitously
thrown
down
from
a
fluid
to
a
solid
or
a
state
it
can
not
be
from
any
blind
or
inconsiderate
haste
on
the
part
of
the
molecules
themselves
there
must
be
some
independent
principle
or
law
of
nature
one
presupposing
an
intelligent
to
effect
the
precipitating
process
if
any
such
really
exists
but
it
does
not
exist
the
first
step
is
one
of
development
and
growth
the
manifestation
of
functional
activity
the
building
up
of
organic
or
cellular
tissue
the
exact
process
in
the
case
of
plants
and
trees
is
well
known
all
those
familiar
with
the
characteristic
differences
of
seeds
their
chemical
constituents
their
tegumentary
coverings
rudimentary
parts
thoroughly
understand
the
process
in
its
outward
manifestation
there
is
no
precipitation
of
molecules
as
in
an
organic
fluid
unless
the
albumen
lying
between
the
embryo
and
testa
of
the
seeds
and
constituting
the
nutriment
on
which
the
plant
feeds
during
its
primary
stages
of
growth
can
be
called
a
fluid
it
throws
none
of
its
characteristic
ingredients
downward
any
more
than
upward
indeed
the
greater
tendency
of
its
molecules
is
upward
rather
than
downward
in
the
molecular
processes
vital
ones
by
which
the
embryonic
cell
is
started
upon
its
career
of
the
celebrated
liebig
says
of
this
albuminous
environment
it
is
the
foundation
the
of
the
whole
series
of
peculiar
tissues
which
constitute
those
organs
which
are
the
seat
of
all
vital
actions
in
the
case
of
animal
life
this
albumen
abounds
in
the
serum
of
the
blood
enters
largely
into
the
chyle
and
lymph
goes
to
build
up
the
tissues
and
muscles
and
is
the
chief
ingredient
of
the
nerves
glands
and
even
the
brain
itself
and
in
all
these
developmental
stages
its
tendency
is
to
coagulate
rather
than
precipitate
in
its
coagulated
condition
it
dries
to
a
hard
partially
translucent
and
friable
state
and
is
more
or
less
insoluble
in
water
and
entirely
so
at
a
temperature
from
to
when
the
seed
is
planted
or
placed
in
water
it
first
commences
to
swell
from
the
absorption
of
the
water
or
moisture
of
the
ground
by
the
pores
of
its
external
covering
the
favorable
temperature
being
from
to
it
gradually
expands
until
its
outer
membranes
burst
and
its
initial
rootlets
clasp
their
hold
upon
the
earth
from
this
point
its
several
stages
of
development
are
well
known
to
the
ordinary
observer
here
the
first
step
is
absorption
and
expansion
not
precipitation
there
is
also
a
change
in
chemical
conditions
the
water
at
least
being
decomposed
for
it
would
seem
to
be
a
law
of
vegetal
growth
that
reproduction
should
begin
in
decomposition
and
decay
the
apostle
description
of
the
death
of
the
grain
as
symbolizing
the
death
of
man
in
his
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
points
conclusively
in
this
direction
it
is
in
the
decomposition
and
decay
of
the
grain
that
the
implanted
germ
is
quickened
into
life
ascends
into
the
bright
light
the
warm
sunshine
the
refreshing
presence
of
showers
and
dews
in
this
way
it
fulfils
its
providential
purpose
of
yielding
to
the
sower
the
more
munificent
life
which
he
is
forever
seeking
to
attain
its
germination
is
the
springing
up
of
the
inner
living
principle
of
the
grain
not
its
outer
envelope
or
dead
husk
this
disappears
in
decay
except
the
small
nutrient
portion
within
which
the
germinal
principle
of
life
would
seem
to
reside
and
which
undergoes
a
thorough
chemical
change
in
the
process
of
passing
from
death
unto
life
or
being
assimilated
and
taken
up
into
the
new
living
structure
the
apostle
comparison
distinctly
marks
these
several
changes
as
the
one
process
of
passing
from
death
unto
life
he
saw
in
this
wonderful
provision
of
nature
the
still
more
wonderful
prevision
of
god
to
his
mind
it
was
over
the
debris
of
the
dead
past
that
the
living
present
is
constantly
marching
towards
a
higher
and
more
perfect
life
the
ultimate
fruition
and
joy
of
an
eternal
home
in
the
skies
and
he
saw
that
the
two
grand
instrumentalities
and
agencies
to
this
end
were
life
and
death
both
equally
constant
and
active
like
all
the
other
instrumentalities
and
governing
agencies
of
the
universe
life
is
forever
unlocking
the
portals
of
the
present
to
youth
and
vigor
death
is
forever
closing
them
to
age
and
decrepitude
this
divine
prevision
thus
becomes
the
wisest
and
most
beneficent
provision
without
life
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
death
and
without
death
no
such
thing
as
this
grand
succession
and
march
of
life
this
passing
from
out
the
shadow
into
the
day
chapter
darwinism
considered
from
a
vitalistic
granting
that
the
assumption
of
darwinism
rests
as
claimed
on
the
fixed
and
inflexible
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
in
the
diversified
yet
measurably
specialized
processes
of
nature
there
is
no
logical
deduction
to
be
drawn
therefrom
but
that
which
traces
the
representatives
of
all
the
great
types
of
the
animal
kingdom
to
one
single
source
and
that
not
the
sovereign
intelligence
of
the
universe
but
a
mere
ovule
in
protoplasm
or
what
may
be
defined
in
its
unaggregated
form
as
an
inconceivably
small
whirligig
having
motion
on
a
central
axis
but
whether
an
independent
motion
of
its
own
or
one
derived
from
an
infinite
intelligence
the
darwinian
systematizers
are
not
bold
enough
to
aver
they
have
too
many
scruples
either
to
assert
the
one
proposition
or
to
deny
the
other
what
set
this
little
whirligig
in
motion
is
a
mystery
that
lies
beyond
the
purview
of
science
so
called
and
into
the
depths
of
this
infinitessimal
and
most
mysterious
little
chamber
they
refuse
to
go
they
search
not
for
the
evidence
of
an
infinite
intelligence
in
the
outermost
circle
of
the
heavens
where
the
highest
is
to
be
found
and
where
a
bound
is
set
that
we
may
not
pass
but
shutting
their
eyes
to
all
the
grander
evidences
of
such
an
intelligence
they
dive
down
into
the
infinitessimal
realm
of
nature
and
assume
to
dig
out
the
sublimer
secrets
of
the
universe
there
and
this
is
their
grand
discovery
that
this
infinitessimal
whirligig
of
theirs
has
not
only
whirled
man
into
existence
but
the
entire
circle
of
the
heavens
with
the
innumerable
host
of
stars
that
march
therein
and
all
the
boundless
systems
of
worlds
that
roll
in
space
with
this
subordination
of
the
infinite
to
the
infinitessimal
of
intelligence
to
insensate
matter
of
divine
energy
so
to
speak
to
blind
molecular
force
they
are
satisfied
and
like
the
mole
in
the
fable
conceive
their
little
molecule
to
be
the
only
possible
creator
of
a
stupendous
universe
scrutinize
my
propositions
closely
and
see
if
i
am
guilty
of
misstating
theirs
their
new
theory
is
only
a
slight
modification
of
an
old
one
or
the
old
adage
vivum
ex
all
life
is
from
an
egg
for
they
assert
that
every
living
thing
primordially
proceeds
from
an
ovule
in
protoplasm
the
essential
part
of
the
protoplasmic
egg
so
to
speak
being
this
little
or
cellule
from
which
have
issued
all
possible
organisms
in
both
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
nor
is
this
theory
essentially
confined
to
organic
matter
a
scientific
coördination
of
its
several
known
parts
or
alleged
functions
extends
the
operations
of
this
infinitessimal
whirligig
to
the
plastic
or
uniformly
diffused
state
of
all
matter
from
which
has
been
evolved
in
an
infinite
duration
of
past
time
not
only
life
in
its
highest
manifestations
but
a
universe
so
stupendously
grand
that
no
amount
of
human
intelligence
can
grasp
the
first
conception
of
it
emerson
our
ralph
waldo
virtually
accepts
this
theory
of
development
substituting
however
a
stomach
for
an
ovule
and
the
reverse
of
the
darwinian
proposition
in
what
he
is
pleased
to
call
the
incessant
opposition
of
nature
to
everything
hurtful
it
is
not
the
selection
of
the
fittest
but
the
rejection
of
the
unfit
by
which
a
beneficent
necessity
i
use
his
language
is
always
bringing
things
right
it
is
in
the
stomach
of
plants
he
says
that
development
begins
and
ends
in
the
circles
of
the
universe
is
a
long
way
he
admits
from
the
gorilla
to
the
gentleman
from
the
gorilla
to
plato
newton
shakespeare
to
the
sanctities
of
religion
the
refinements
of
legislation
the
summits
of
science
art
poetry
few
persons
i
take
it
will
dispute
this
proposition
the
road
is
a
long
one
and
beset
with
all
sorts
of
thorns
and
briars
such
as
philosophy
will
hardly
eradicate
from
the
wayside
even
the
most
refined
empiricism
will
find
it
difficult
to
stomach
his
stomachic
theory
of
the
universe
which
lands
all
atomic
or
corpuscular
philosophy
in
a
digestive
sac
such
as
jack
falstaff
bore
about
him
with
its
measureless
capacity
for
potations
and
eastcheap
fare
it
is
a
road
too
in
which
philosophy
will
get
many
sharp
raps
from
an
external
world
of
phenomena
in
the
futility
of
both
his
and
the
darwinian
hypothesis
to
explain
away
the
independent
origination
of
certain
species
of
plants
and
animals
new
varieties
still
springing
into
existence
under
favorable
conditions
in
obedience
to
the
divine
fiat
let
the
earth
bring
forth
in
laying
the
foundations
of
this
new
science
if
science
it
shall
be
called
we
must
insist
that
the
course
of
nature
is
uniform
and
that
however
extended
our
generalizations
in
any
one
of
her
lines
of
uniformity
all
intermediate
as
well
as
ultimate
propositions
must
not
only
be
stated
with
the
utmost
scientific
accuracy
but
the
logical
deductions
therefrom
must
also
be
uniform
or
lie
in
the
path
of
uniformity
the
earliest
and
latest
inductions
must
either
coincide
or
approximate
the
same
end
no
links
must
be
broken
no
chasms
bridged
in
the
scientific
series
there
must
be
a
distinct
and
separate
link
connecting
each
preceding
and
each
succeeding
one
in
the
chain
the
lowest
known
mammal
must
be
found
in
immediate
relationship
with
his
higher
congener
or
brother
not
in
any
remote
cousinship
there
must
be
no
saltatory
progress
no
leaping
over
intermediate
steps
or
degrees
the
heights
of
science
are
not
to
be
scaled
except
as
degrees
may
sometimes
be
conferred
by
our
universities
there
are
some
animals
say
our
darwinian
systematizers
like
the
lepidosirens
and
their
congeners
with
the
characteristics
of
amphibians
and
hence
they
infer
that
by
successive
deviations
and
improvements
the
lower
order
has
risen
into
the
higher
but
out
of
what
page
in
the
volume
of
nature
in
the
countless
leaves
we
have
turned
back
has
the
immediate
congener
dropped
that
we
are
obliged
to
look
for
the
relationship
in
cousins
we
might
as
well
say
that
some
of
the
possess
the
same
or
similar
characteristics
and
predicate
relationship
between
them
and
the
amphibians
for
giants
sometimes
spring
from
dwarfs
and
dwarfs
from
giants
at
all
events
our
diagnoses
must
be
freed
from
these
intermediate
breaks
or
failures
in
the
chain
of
continuity
or
the
doctrine
of
descent
must
tumble
with
the
imaginary
foundations
on
which
it
is
built
and
bear
in
mind
that
the
most
enthusiastic
darwinist
is
forced
to
admit
that
there
are
still
rigid
partitions
between
the
lower
and
higher
organisms
that
have
not
been
pierced
by
the
light
of
scientific
truth
but
they
assume
that
future
discoveries
and
investigations
will
solve
the
difficulty
but
science
inflexible
as
she
is
or
ought
to
be
in
her
demands
admits
of
no
assumptions
much
less
sanctions
such
exceptions
and
deviations
as
we
constantly
find
in
the
darwinian
path
of
continuity
the
eye
of
imagination
can
supply
nothing
to
her
vision
she
is
and
soars
into
the
bright
empyrean
does
not
dive
into
quagmires
and
the
slime
of
creation
after
truth
but
let
us
see
how
darwin
bridges
one
of
the
very
first
chasms
he
meets
with
in
constructing
his
chain
of
generation
he
goes
back
to
the
first
link
or
to
what
he
calls
primordial
generation
here
the
leap
is
from
inorganic
matter
to
the
lowest
form
of
organic
life
from
inanimate
to
animate
dust
the
chasm
is
immense
as
all
will
agree
but
he
bridges
it
by
falling
back
on
his
infinitessimal
whirligig
his
or
on
the
motions
of
elements
as
yet
inaccessible
except
to
the
eye
of
imagination
for
even
plato
monad
or
ultimate
atom
was
not
matter
itself
being
indivisible
but
rather
a
formal
unit
or
primary
constituent
of
matter
which
like
darwin
whirligig
in
its
unaggregated
form
admits
of
neither
a
maximum
nor
a
minimum
of
comprehension
but
rests
entirely
on
imaginary
hypothesis
and
we
may
here
add
that
a
system
which
begins
in
imaginary
hypotheses
and
ends
in
them
as
that
of
bridging
the
chasmal
difference
between
a
gorilla
and
a
plato
can
be
dignified
into
a
science
only
by
a
still
greater
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
of
bridging
the
difference
between
the
darwinian
zero
and
his
ninety
degrees
of
development
in
a
darwin
himself
bear
in
mind
as
we
proceed
that
the
function
of
an
argument
in
philosophy
as
in
logic
is
to
prove
that
a
certain
relation
exists
between
two
concepts
or
objects
of
thought
when
that
relation
is
not
in
the
darwinian
chain
we
have
as
the
first
link
organic
life
springing
from
inorganic
matter
without
the
slightest
relation
existing
between
the
two
except
what
may
be
universally
predicated
of
matter
itself
whether
animate

inanimate
organic
or
inorganic
and
there
is
no
other
affirmative
premise
expressing
their
agreement
as
extremes
that
can
possibly
admit
of
an
affirmative
conclusion
the
parts
are
so
separated
in
thought
that
no
metaphysical
or
ideal
distinction
exists
to
coordinate
them
in
classification
we
are
simply
forced
back
in
our
attempt
at
classification
upon
the
intuitions
of
consciousness
where
reason
manifestly
ceases
to
enforce
its
inductions
and
here
the
human
mind
intuitively
springs
an
objection
which
is
at
once
aimed
at
the
very
citadel
of
darwinism
on
what
rests
the
validity
of
these
intuitions
except
it
be
that
breath
of
life
which
as
we
have
before
said
was
breathed
into
man
when
he
became
a
living
soul
if
we
follow
the
divine
record
instead
of
these
blind
systematizers
leading
the
blind
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
establishing
the
validity
of
these
intuitions
the
highest
potential
factors
this
side
of
deity
to
be
found
anywhere
in
the
universe
for
if
our
intuitions
are
not
to
be
relied
upon
if
their
objects
and
perceptions
are
to
be
discarded
as
unreliable
then
there
can
be
no
agreement
or
disagreement
between
any
two
ideas
presented
objectively
or
subjectively
to
the
human
mind
no
processes
of
mental
analysis
or
ratiocination
like
those
pursued
in
the
elementary
methods
of
euclid
can
present
the
basis
of
an
intellectual
judgment
or
lay
the
foundation
of
the
slightest
faith
or
belief
in
the
world
to
deny
the
primary
perception
of
truth
by
intuition
is
as
fatal
to
evolution
as
to
the
sublimer
teachings
of
the
bible
genesis
but
from
the
very
nature
of
our
being
as
well
as
the
primary
of
consciousness
itself
we
must
rest
the
validity
of
these
intuitions
on
something
and
that
something
more
than
a
finite
intelligence
and
since
science
with
all
her
knowledge
methodically
digested
and
arranged
furnishes
no
clue
to
the
mystery
we
are
left
to
the
higher
sources
of
inspiration
to
reach
it
and
this
inspiration
however
it
may
be
derived
necessarily
becomes
a
part
of
our
intuitions
since
it
addresses
itself
to
the
strongest
possible
cravings
of
the
human
soul
and
is
accepted
as
its
inseparable
companion
and
guest
shall
we
build
our
faith
then
on
the
divine
word
on
the
word
that
was
in
the
beginning
with
god
and
when
incarnate
god
or
on
darwin
little
whirligig
that
originally
set
everything
in
motion
and
has
only
to
go
on
to
whirl
us
out
a
god
as
it
has
already
whirled
us
out
a
darwinian
universe
without
one
for
if
this
ovulistic
whirligig
has
bridged
the
chasmal
difference
between
protoplasm
and
man
since
the
transition
from
inorganic
matter
to
organic
life
the
process
has
only
to
be
indefinitely
extended
to
bridge
the
chasm
between
man
and
deity
or
between
finite
and
infinite
intelligence
this
gives
us
nature
evolving
a
god
instead
of
the
doctrine
of
the
old
theogonies
of
a
god
presiding
from
all
eternity
over
nature
one
who
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
that
it
should
not
be
removed
forever
who
stretchest
out
the
heavens
like
a
curtain
who
layeth
the
beams
of
his
chambers
in
the
waters
who
maketh
his
angels
spirits
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
these
evolutionists
manifestly
get
the
cart
before
the
horse
in
their
category
of
cosmological
events
it
is
not
inert
matter
organizing
itself
into
life
nor
any
mode
of
physical
or
chemical
action
nor
any
mere
manifestation
of
motion
or
of
heat
nor
any
other
conceivable
correlation
of
natural
forces
none
of
these
has
enabled
us
to
penetrate
the
mysterious
of
life
itself
for
reasons
obviously
connected
with
our
own
welfare
he
from
whom
alone
are
the
issues
of
life
seems
to
have
ordained
that
we
should
fathom
the
depths
of
both
physical
and
chemical
force
and
beneficently
wield
and
direct
them
to
our
own
uses
but
this
vital
force
this
something
that
stands
apart
from
and
is
essentially
different
from
all
other
kinds
of
force
is
of
a
nature
that
baffles
all
our
efforts
to
approach
the
power
to
grasp
it
or
even
to
penetrate
in
the
slightest
degree
its
mysteries
is
delegated
to
none
all
attempts
to
lay
bare
this
principle
of
vitality
or
level
the
barriers
that
separate
it
from
physical
or
chemical
action
have
utterly
failed
we
know
no
more
of
its
essence
now
than
was
known
a
thousand
years
ago
and
know
no
less
than
will
be
known
a
thousand
years
hence
to
become
masters
of
the
mystery
we
must
enter
the
impenetrable
veil
within
which
the
infinite
intelligence
of
the
universe
presides
who
we
are
told
sendeth
forth
his
spirit
and
we
are
created
who
taketh
away
our
breath
we
die
and
return
to
our
dust
we
are
just
as
much
bewildered
in
respect
to
this
vital
principle
in
our
classifications
of
the
myriads
of
little
creatures
careering
over
the
field
of
the
microscope
as
when
we
turn
to
the
most
marked
formations
of
genera
and
species
in
geological
distribution
the
great
trouble
with
darwin
is
that
its
weakest
links
are
precisely
where
the
strongest
should
be
found
and
with
a
candor
rarely
displayed
by
a
writer
who
is
spinning
a
theory
he
admits
this
the
geological
record
is
not
what
he
would
have
it
to
be
whole
chapters
are
gone
where
they
are
most
needed
and
nature
lithography
seems
constantly
at
fault
independent
species
are
now
and
then
springing
up
where
derivatives
should
be
looked
for
while
derivatives
are
everywhere
disappearing
in
many
of
the
middle
tertiary
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
later
tertiary
period
are
specifically
identical
with
the
living
species
of
what
has
natural
selection
been
doing
for
this
family
in
the
last
million
years
or
more
manifestly
nothing
and
less
than
nothing
for
some
of
the
species
have
dropped
out
altogether
these
facts
and
hundreds
of
others
like
them
are
constantly
obtruding
themselves
upon
our
attention
to
show
in
harmony
with
the
bible
genesis
the
immutability
of
species
the
absolute
fixity
of
types
rather
than
their
variability
as
claimed
if
nature
abhors
anything
more
than
a
it
is
manifestly
any
marked
transition
from
fixed
types
and
she
thunders
her
edicts
against
it
in
the
of
all
hybrids
the
doctrine
of
variation
lacks
the
element
of
continuity
and
is
oftener
at
war
with
the
theory
of
the
selection
of
the
fittest
than
it
is
with
the
selection
of
the
unfit
the
leap
from
lepidosirens
to
amphibians
is
no
greater
than
the
interval
between
any
two
species
of
animals
or
plants
yet
discovered
either
fossil
or
living
the
intervals
are
as
numerous
as
the
species
themselves
and
everywhere
constitute
great
and
sudden
leaps
or
such
transitional
changes
as
natural
selection
could
not
have
effected
independently
of
intervening
forms
those
that
nowhere
exist
in
nature
and
never
have
existed
if
we
are
to
credit
geologic
and
paleontologic
records
there
is
everywhere
similarity
of
structure
but
not
identity
and
the
nearer
we
approach
to
identity
of
structure
the
wider
the
divergence
in
similarity
of
characteristics
a
bird
may
be
taught
to
talk
and
sing
snatches
of
music
but
no
monkey
has
ever
been
able
to
articulate
human
sounds
much
less
give
them
rhythmical
utterance
take
the
case
of
the
wild
pigeon
a
subject
that
especially
delights
darwin
most
of
the
deviations
are
confined
to
the
domesticated
breeds
and
none
of
these
rank
in
strength
hardiness
capability
of
flight
or
symmetry
of
structure
with
the
wild
or
typical
bird
there
are
deviations
but
no
sensible
improvements
except
to
the
eye
of
the
the
deviations
are
simply
entailed
weaknesses
or
the
very
reverse
of
what
should
appear
from
the
selection
of
the
fittest
the
fact
undeniably
is
that
these
variations
are
almost
wholly
abnormal
mere
exaggerated
characteristics
induced
in
the
first
instance
perhaps
by
high
cultivation
and
close
breeding
turn
these
abnormal
varieties
loose
let
them
go
back
to
the
aboriginal
stock
and
these
characteristics
will
rapidly
disappear
that
is
they
will
ultimately
lose
themselves
or
melt
away
in
the
original
type
darwin
admits
that
the
tendency
will
be
to
reversion
but
he
insists
manifestly
without
any
positive
proof
therefor
that
the
greater
tendency
is
to
new
centres
of
attraction
and
not
necessarily
the
primitive
one
but
this
is
mere
assumption
sheer
begging
the
question
on
his
part
since
all
the
oscillations
are
incontestibly
about
the
original
or
type
centre
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
typical
races
of
men
like
the
negro
and
wild
indian
of
our
prairies
you
may
lift
them
out
of
their
primitive
condition
temporarily
suspend
if
you
please
so
to
put
it
their
primordial
attraction
but
left
again
to
themselves
they
will
go
back
to
the
original
type
that
is
their
offspring
will
again
infest
the
jungles
and
roam
their
native
the
process
here
is
the
very
reverse
of
the
darwinian
theory
reversion
as
a
rule
follows
the
degeneracy
of
types
instead
of
there
being
any
favorable
homogeneous
result
springing
from
a
new
centre
of
attraction
the
indian
makes
a
splendid
savage
but
a
very
poor
white
man
think
of
red
jacket
taking
the
part
of
mercutio
in
the
play
or
enacting
the
more
valiant
of
falstaff
in
king
henry
the
fourth
an
infusion
of
white
blood
does
not
help
the
matter
but
rather
makes
it
worse
generally
the
meanest
indian
on
the
continent
is
your
and
among
the
negroes
there
is
no
term
so
expressive
of
the
contempt
of
that
race
as
that
applied
by
them
to
a
mulatto
the
present
condition
of
mexico
affords
a
striking
exemplification
of
this
law
of
reversion
the
inheritable
characteristics
or
variations
produced
from
an
infusion
of
spanish
blood
are
rapidly
disappearing
the
native
blood
whipping
out
the
european
the
potency
is
in
the
inferior
blood
simply
because
it
is
the
predominating
one
the
result
has
been
no
homogeneous
new
race
but
a
reversion
now
manifestly
in
progress
to
the
type
centre
or
aboriginal
stock
and
the
curse
pronounced
by
ezekiel
upon
mongrel
tribes
woe
unto
the
mingled
peoples
may
have
a
significance
in
this
connection
worth
considering
but
it
manifestly
falls
outside
the
scope
of
our
present
inquiry
in
considering
the
embryological
structure
of
man
and
the
homologies
he
therein
presents
to
the
lower
animals
darwin
thus
conclusively
in
his
judgment
remarks
we
thus
learn
that
man
is
descended
from
a
hairy
quadruped
furnished
with
a
tail
and
pointed
ears
probably
arboreal
in
his
habits
and
an
inhabitant
of
the
old
world
but
darwin
pronominal
we
in
this
connection
admits
of
qualification
he
can
hardly
speak
for
all
the
scientific
world
at
once
the
philosophical
maxim
of
sir
isaac
newton
non
i
build
no
hypotheses
make
no
suppositions
but
adhere
to
facts
has
a
few
followers
still
left
but
what
are
darwin
facts
has
he
yet
discovered
the
caudal
man
except
as
the
stanley
heard
of
one
in
africa
and
where
is
his
monkey
that
first
lost
the
prehensile
power
to
climb
trees
for
bear
in
mind
that
it
was
the
loss
of
this
prehensile
power
that
resulted
in
the
caudal
atrophy
of
our
monkey
progenitors
became
men
simply
because
they
were
tailless
monkeys
they
had
lost
their
power
to
climb
trees
and
accordingly
had
no
longer
any
use
for
tails
to
let
themselves
down
from
the
limbs
a
beneficent
necessity
therefore
according
to
emerson
dropped
the
tail
as
something
decidedly
unfit
for
the
simplest
tyro
in
darwinian
philosophy
will
see
that
the
loss
of
the
catarrhine
monkey
tail
if
it
ever
occurred
could
not
have
resulted
from
the
selection
of
the
fittest
the
deeper
emersonian
philosophy
of
the
rejection
of
the
unfit
affords
the
only
solution
of
the
difficulty
and
then
only
on
the
assumption
that
the
tail
is
an
unfit
appendage
for
the
monkey
with
the
loss
of
his
tail
in
the
light
of
this
new
genesis
the
monkey
necessarily
ceased
to
be
arboreal
in
his
habits
he
could
no
longer
subsist
on
the
fruits
and
nuts
of
trees
or
take
refuge
therein
from
his
enemies
he
had
to
go
to
work
and
make
weapons
to
defend
himself
to
construct
tools
make
and
set
traps
live
on
his
wits
and
not
on
his
prehensile
power
to
climb
trees
he
soon
discovered
of
course
that
the
longest
pole
knocked
the
persimmon
this
was
his
first
intellectual
stride
towards
the
future
edison
from
the
simplest
sort
of
grahamitic
philosopher
he
passed
into
the
robust
englishman
but
this
was
not
all
as
an
arboreal
gymnast
he
was
manifestly
on
his
way
to
more
masterly
feats
of
agility
than
ever
those
dependent
not
on
muscular
function
but
on
the
nervous
action
of
the
brain
and
spinal
marrow
necessity
became
with
him
the
mother
of
invention
and
how
admirably
he
improved
under
this
maternal
instructor
we
are
left
to
infer
from
the
paramount
conclusion
of
darwin
the
demoralized
monkey
became
the
incipient
but
this
conclusively
accounts
for
only
one
of
the
many
anatomical
differences
between
man
and
his
caudal
progenitor
for
why
should
the
loss
of
his
tail
have
resulted
in
the
changed
chemistry
of
the
brain
or
in
the
increased
involutions
of
his
brain
even
the
specific
differences
between
the
present
and
ancestral
types
are
very
numerous
and
demand
separate
classification
their
variability
runs
through
every
bone
muscle
tissue
fibre
nerve
their
blood
corpuscles
are
not
the
same
the
chemistry
of
their
bones
essentially
differs
the
nerves
are
differently
bundled
and
differently
strung
in
intonations
of
voice
symmetry
of
arms
legs
chest
hairlessness
of
body
and
aquatic
and
land
habits
the
frog
is
a
much
nearer
approach
to
man
than
the
monkey
as
all
caricaturists
delineating
aldermanic
proportions
will
agree
and
darwin
might
have
immortalized
himself
by
deriving
the
builders
of
the
ancient
and
other
primitive
and
croakers
of
the
swiss
lakes
from
this
tailless
batrachian
for
everybody
knows
or
thinks
he
knows
how
the
frog
lost
his
tail
if
he
did
wag
it
off
he
certainly
absorbed
its
waggishness
as
a
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
coming
man
the
future
artemas
wards
and
mark
twains
of
the
race
this
ancestral
origin
will
also
account
for
the
otherwise
unaccountable
proclivity
of
all
human
juveniles
to
play
at
the
game
of
besides
it
would
have
relieved
darwin
from
one
of
the
greatest
perplexities
he
has
had
to
encounter
as
he
derives
man
from
a
hairy
quadruped
the
absence
of
hair
on
the
human
body
is
a
phenomenal
fact
that
gives
him
great
trouble
he
agrees
that
it
does
not
result
from
natural
selection
as
he
says
the
loss
of
hair
is
an
inconvenience
and
probably
an
injury
to
man
nor
does
he
suppose
it
to
result
from
what
he
calls
correlated
development
he
is
more
puzzled
over
this
problem
of
divestiture
than
any
other
and
finds
the
solution
of
it
only
in
sexual
selection
that
is
he
assumes
that
among
our
progenitors
far
back
in
the
tertiary
or
some
other
period
some
female
monkeys
were
less
hirsute
than
others
and
that
they
naturally
preferred
males
possessing
similar
characteristics
these
divergencies
were
thus
commenced
and
by
continuous
sexual
selection
the
infirmity
for
such
he
regards
the
loss
of
hair
was
propagated
until
the
race
was
almost
entirely
denuded
or
bereft
of
this
covering
in
the
same
way
he
accounts
for
nearly
all
the
differentiations
of
the
race
among
the
various
tribes
now
or
formerly
inhabiting
the
earth
all
have
sprung
from
the
same
progenitors
that
lost
their
capacity
to
subsist
as
apes
and
hence
found
it
necessary
to
subsist
as
the
law
of
degeneracy
has
therefore
had
quite
as
much
to
do
with
human
origins
as
that
of
progressive
development
in
fact
it
is
the
paramount
law
from
a
darwinian
for
the
loss
of
hair
and
of
the
prehensile
power
to
climb
trees
are
both
conceded
by
darwin
to
be
serious
defects
and
drawbacks
in
the
ape
family
but
the
law
of
sexual

as
treated
by
the

is
not
scientifically
accurate
nor
is
it
true
in
fact
the
loving
tendency
of
nature
is
to
opposites
not

the
positive
and
negative
poles
are
those
that
play
into
each
other
with
most
marvellous
effect
each
repels

rushes

neither
natural

counter

the

sexual

as
treated
by
its
author
plays
no
intelligible
part
in
the
economy
of
nature
except
to
counterbalance
variability
not
to
propagate
it
but
the
darwinian
assumption
that
the
primeval
man
or
his
immediate
progenitor
came
through
natural
selection
that
is
through
the
survival
of
the
fittest
is
subject
to
one
or
two
other
objections
which
we
shall
briefly
notice
and
the
first
objection
is
not
altogether
a
technical
one
the
term
fittest
as
applied
to
a
monkey
has
at
once
a
definite
and
comprehensive
significance
to
us
it
implies
the
presence
of
whatever
is
most
perfect
of
its
kind
in
the
monkey
a
monkey
and
not
in
the
monkey
something
else
than
a
monkey
they
are
all
admirably
adapted
for
climbing
trees
and
it
is
this
adaptation
that
secures
them
safety
or
complete
immunity
in
shelter
from
their
enemies
to
say
that
nature
selects
the
fittest
for
them
for
any
species
of
monkey
by
converting
their
forefeet
into
rudimentary
hands
with
a
loss
of
prehension
and
no
corresponding
advantages
in
locomotion
is
to
use
language
without
any
appreciable
significance
to
us
we
can
only
say
that
what
is
fittest
for
the
monkey
is
for
man
and
the
reverse
this
is
all
we
can
definitely
predicate
of
them
from
what
we
know
of
their
anatomical
structure
and
the
diversified
uses
to
which
it
may
be
put
the
fact
is
as
the
bible
genesis
shows
that
every
living
thing
is
perfect
of
its
kind
and
whatever
is
perfect
admits
of
no
darwinian
variations
or
improvements
for
the
better
and
the
simple
statement
of
this
undeniable
proposition
is
we
submit
a
complete
refutation
of
darwinism
when
the
waters
and
the
earth
were
commanded
to
bring
forth
abundantly
of
every
living
creature
and
every
living
thing
it
was
so
and
god
saw
that
it
was
good
that
is
everything
perfect
of
its
kind
and
in
its
kind
with
this
single
limitation
as
to
kind
a
rattlesnake
is
no
less
perfect
than
a
plato
or
a
john
howard
when
we
consider
man
upright
position
the
firmness
and
steadiness
with
which
he
plants
his
foot
upon
the
earth
when
we
examine
the
mechanism
of
his
hand
and
the
wonderful
and
almost
unlimited
range
it
possesses
for
diversified
use
when
we
see
how
he
is
for
climbing
trees
yet
how
express
and
admirable
for
climbing
among
the
stars
even
to
the
outermost
the
idea
that
what
is
fittest
for
him
is
fit
for
the
chattering
monkey
is
too
absurd
to
give
us
pause
and
yet
how
does
darwin
know
that
the
monkey
has
been
climbing
up
all
these
hundred
thousand
or
million
years
into
man
as
one
of
the
congenital
freaks
of
nature
and
not
man
shambling
down
into
the
monkey
as
a
reverse
congenital
freak
children
have
sometimes
been
born
with
a
singular
resemblance
to
the
ape
family
but
no
ape
has
ever
to
knowledge
produced
issue
more
manlike
than
itself
the
divergencies
run
the
wrong
way
to
meet
the
conditions
of
the
development
theory
we
have
had
nearly
five
thousand
years
in
which
to
mark
these
transitional
changes
and
yet
the
monkey
of
is
identical
with
that
painted
on
the
walls
of
ancient
meroe
in
all
this
time
he
has
made
no
advance
in
the
genetic
relation
and
if
we
turn
back
the
lithographic
pages
of
nature
for
a
hundred
times
five
thousand
years
we
shall
find
no
essential
departure
from
aboriginal
types
but
the
darwinian
hypothesis
admits
of
a
more
conclusive
answer
than
we
have
yet
given
past
time
it
will
be
conceded
is
theoretically
if
not
actually
infinite
and
in
all
past
time
nature
has
been
tugging
away
at
darwin
problem
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
it
is
no
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
years
nor
two
hundred
and
fifty
millions
but
an
infinite
duration
of
past
time
that
covers
the
period
in
which
she
has
been
wrestling
with
this
problem
how
successfully
has
she
solved
it
in
the
darwinian
sense
of
the
term
fittest
she
has
not
so
much
as
stated
her
first
equation
or
extracted
the
root
of
her
first
power
she
is
manifestly
as
much
puzzled
over
the
problem
as
darwin
himself
he
fails
to
see
that
the
survival
of
the
fittest
necessarily
implies
or
carries
with
it
the
correlative
proposition
the
of
the
unfit
and
when
such
a
law
has
been
operative
for
an
infinite
duration
of
past
time
the
unfit
however
infinitely
distributed
at
first
should
have
disappeared
altogether
many
thousands
if
not
millions
of
years
ago
if
the
evolutionists
are
dealing
with
vast
problems
and
assigning
to
nature
unlimited
factors
to
express
the
totality
of
her
unerring
operations
they
must
be
careful
to
limit
the
time
in
which
any
one
of
her
given
labors
is
to
be
accomplished
if
she
makes
any
progress
at
all
an
infinite
duration
of
past
time
should
enable
her
to
complete
her
work
just
as
effectually
as
an
infinite
duration
of
time
to
come
but
by
what
law
of
natural
selection
appertaining
to
a
single
pair
of
old
world
monkeys
have
their
offspring
advanced
to
this
regal
state
of
manhood
while
all
other
pairs
have
remained
stationary
or
precisely
where
they
were
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
years
ago
or
more
why
this
exceptional
divergence
in
the
case
of
a
single
pair
of
monkeys
why
this
anomalous
aberrant
and
thoroughly
eccentric
movement
on
the
part
of
nature
we
had
supposed
that
her
operations
were
uniform
conformable
to
fixed
laws
of
movement
the
doctrine
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
implies
this
why
then
should
nature
in
her
unerring
operations
have
selected
the
fittest
in
respect
to
a
single
pair
of
catarrhine
monkeys
and
at
the
same
time
rejected
the
fittest
in
the
case
of
a
million
other
pairs
if
she
had
selected
only
the
fittest
in
respect
to
this
old
world
stock
of
monkeys
the
entire
catarrhine
family
should
have
disappeared
in
the
next
higher
or
fitter
group
a
group
nowhere
to
be
found
in
geological
distribution
the
break
between
man
and
this
catarrhine
monkey
covers
quite
a
series
of
links
in
the
genetic
vinculum
and
yet
between
the
two
we
find
no
high
form
of
a
low
type
fitting
into
a
low
form
of
a
high
type
as
we
manifestly
should
to
account
for
all
the
diversified
changes
that
must
have
taken
place
in
the
interim
and
what
is
true
of
the
types
is
measurably
true
of
the
classes
within
the
types
as
well
as
of
the
orders
within
the
classes
wide
deviations
in
forms
as
in
characteristics
would
seem
to
be
the
invariable
rule
the
blending
of
type
into
type
except
perhaps
in
remote
relationships
is
nowhere
visible
but
if
variation
and
natural
selection
have
played
important
parts
in
the
economy
of
nature
why
may
not
specific
creation
have
played
part
also
positive
science
can
hardly
flatter
itself
with
the
belief
that
it
is
rolling
back
the
mystery
of
the
universe
to
a
point
beyond
which
specific
creation
might
not
have
commenced
or
the
divine
fiat
been
put
forth
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
a
rational
synthesis
limited
to
sensible
experience
or
phenomenal
facts
within
our
reach
that
shall
climb
from
law
to
law
or
from
concrete
fact
to
abstract
conception
until
it
shall
reach
the
of
all
law
is
to
carry
the
faith
of
the
scientist
beyond
the
most
transcendental
belief
of
the
theologian
and
make
him
a
greater
dupe
to
his
illusions
than
was
ever
cloistered
in
a
monastery
or
affected
austerity
therein
as
a
balm
to
the
flesh
we
may
substitute
new
dogmatisms
for
old
ones
but
we
can
never
postulate
a
principle
that
shall
make
the
general
laws
of
nature
any
less
mysterious
than
the
partial
or
exceptional
or
that
shall
in
the
long
run
render
natural
selection
any
more
comprehensible
or
acceptable
to
the
rational
intuition
than
specific
creation
for
while
one
class
of
scientists
is
climbing
the
ladder
of
synthesis
by
assigning
a
reason
for
a
higher
law
that
may
be
predicated
of
a
lower
we
shall
find
the
broader
and
more
analytical
mind
accepting
the
higher
mystery
for
the
lower
and
by
divesting
its
faith
of
all
metaphysical
incumbrance
landing
in
the
belief
of
an
law
which
shall
comprehend
the
entire
assemblage
of
known
laws
and
facts
in
the
universe
and
the
natural
drift
of
the
human
mind
is
ever
towards
this
abstract
conception
this
one
law
of
the
universe
it
steadily
speculates
in
this
direction
and
some
of
the
highest
triumphs
of
our
age
in
physical
as
well
as
metaphysical
science
are
measurably
due
to
this
tendency
the
scientific
mind
is
not
confined
wholly
to
experimental
research
it
is
stimulated
to
higher
contemplations
and
is
constantly
disposed
to
make
larger
and
more
comprehensive
groupings
of
analogous
facts
it
is
fast
coming
to
regard
light
heat
electricity
magnetism
gravitation
chemical
affinity
molecular
force
and
even
darwin
little
whirligig
as
only
so
many
manifestations
or
expressions
of
one
and
the
same
force
in
the
universe
that
ultimate
divine
force
not
to
speak
unscientifically
that
upholds
the
order
of
the
heavens
binds
the
sweet
influences
of
the
pleiades
brings
forth
mazzaroth
in
his
season
and
guides
arcturus
with
his
suns
it
is
the
boast
of
the
darwinian
systematizers
that
their
development
theory
not
only
harmonizes
with
but
admirably
supplements
and
the
grander
speculation
of
laplace
termed
the
nebular
hypothesis
which
regards
the
universe
as
having
originally
consisted
of
uniformly
diffused
matter
filling
all
space
which
subsequently
became
aggregated
by
gravitation
much
after
the
manner
of
darwin
little
whirligig
into
an
infinite
number
of
occupying
inconceivably
vast
areas
in
space
of
the
correctness
of
this
hypothesis
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
it
is
to
the
darwinian
speculation
what
the
infinite
is
to
the
infinitessimal
and
we
only
refer
to
it
to
bring
out
the
vastness
of
the
conception
as
compared
to
the
latter
theory
and
to
predicate
thereon
the
more
conclusive
induction
that
an
infinite
intelligence
directs
and
superintends
all
in
an
area
in
the
not
exceeding
of
the
moon
disc
herschel
computes
the
number
of
stars
at
not
less
than
twenty
thousand
with
clusters
of
nebulae
lying
still
beyond
as
we
know
that
no
bodies
shining
by
reflected
light
could
be
visible
at
such
enormous
distances
we
are
left
to
conclude
that
each
of
these
twinkling
points
is
a
sun
dispensing
light
and
heat
to
probably
as
many
planets
as
hold
their
courses
about
the
central
orb
in
our
own
system
from
the
superior
magnitude
of
many
of
the
stars
as
compared
with
the
sun
we
may
reasonably
infer
that
many
of
these
vast
occupy
a
much
larger
field
in
space
than
our
own
this
would
give
an
area
in
space
of
not
less
than
six
thousand
millions
of
miles
as
the
field
occupied
by
each
of
these
and
as
the
distance
between
each
of
these
systems
and
its
nearest
neighbor
is
probably
not
less
than
that
of
our
sun
from
the
nearest
star
we
have
the
enormous
and
inconceivable
distance
of
not
less
than
nineteen
billions
of
miles
separating
each
one
of
these
twenty
thousand
stars
or
occupying
a
space
in
the
heavens
apparently
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
and
yet
infinity
as
we
apprehend
the
term
lies
beyond
this
vast
cluster
of
constellated
worlds
where
is
darwin
little
whirligig
in
the
comparison
or
emerson
vegetal
stomach
or
herbert
spencer
potential
factors
to
express
the
of
all
this
totality
this
gigantic
assemblage
of
stars
clustered
about
a
single
point
in
the
the
human
mind
absolutely
reels
staggers
bewildered
and
amazed
under
the
load
of
conceptions
imposed
by
these
few
twinkling
stars
and
is
ready
to
exclaim
oh
science
hast
thou
wandered
there
to
waft
us
back
a
message
of
despair
but
when
we
reflect
that
all
this
vast
aggregation
of
sun
systems
visible
in
the
telescopic
field
is
not
stationary
but
is
revolving
with
inconceivable
rapidity
about
some
unknown
and
infinitely
remote
centre
of
the
universe
how
immeasurably
vast
does
the
conception
become
and
how
unutterably
puerile
and
fatuous
the
thought
of
darwin
little
whirligig
as
the
author
of
it
all
no
wonder
the
inspired
psalmist
exclaims
the
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
the
firmament
showeth
his
handiwork
but
listen
to
the
darwinian
exclamation
the
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
my
little
whirligig
and
the
firmament
showeth
the
immensity
of
my
little
ovules
with
the
veil
of
faith
and
inspiration
lifted
the
words
of
the
psalmist
swell
into
the
highest
cherubic
anthem
while
those
of
darwin
hardly
rise
above
the
squeak
of
a
mole
burrowing
beneath
the
glebe
and
what
presumptuous
mortal
shall
say
that
this
infinitely
remote
centre
of
the
universe
around
which
revolves
this
infinite
number
of
is
not
the
seat
and
throne
of
the
infinite
one
himself
the
sovereign
intelligence
and
power
of
the
universe
directing
and
upholding
all
we
know
that
some
of
the
stars
are
travelling
about
this
central
point
of
the
heavens
at
a
pace
exceeding
miles
an
hour
or
with
nearly
three
times
the
rapidity
of
our
earth
in
its
orbit
that
there
must
be
infinite
power
not
physical
at
this
unknown
centre
of
the
universe
to
hold
these
myriads
of
in
their
courses
is
a
logical
induction
as
irrefragable
as
that
the
sun
holds
his
planets
in
their
orbits
and
if
infinite
power
is
predicable
upon
this
central
point
why
not
infinite
intelligence
also
intelligence
we
know
controls
and
utilizes
all
power
in
this
world
why
not
all
power
in
the
universe
it
can
utilize
every
drop
of
water
that
thunders
down
niagara
as
it
has
already
seized
upon
the
lightnings
of
heaven
to
make
them
our
this
is
what
finite
intelligence
that
insignificant
factor
that
science
would
eliminate
from
the
universe
can
do
then
what
may
not
infinite
intelligence
accomplish
but
the
darwinian
systematizers
object
that
science
must
limit
itself
to
a
coordination
of
the
known
relations
of
things
in
the
universe
or
deal
only
with
phenomenal
facts
not
dogmatisms
forgetting
that
they
dogmatize
quite
as
extensively
in
constructing
their
chain
of
generation
as
the
theologians
do
in
adhering
to
the
bible
genesis
no
theologian
objects
to
a
rational
synthesis
of
phenomena
limited
to
sensible
experience
but
in
climbing
from
law
to
law
he
reasonably
enough
insists
that
when
concrete
facts
rise
into
abstract
conceptions
the
highest
round
in
the
ladder
shall
not
be
knocked
out
for
the
accommodation
of
robert
ingersoll
or
any
other
boasted
descendant
of
a
gorilla
and
he
also
insists
that
when
speculation
is
lost
in
abstract
conceptions
the
highest
must
necessarily
press
alone
upon
the
intuitions
of
consciousness
where
all
generalizations
cease
and
all
synthesis
is
undeniably
at
an
end
here
in
this
mysterious
chamber
of
the
soul
we
stand
silent
and
alone
with
only
dim
and
shadowy
phantoms
about
us
as
if
in
the
august
presence
of
deity
itself
but
how
does
scientific
speculation
propose
to
stifle
these
intuitions
of
consciousness
reduce
them
to
the
least
of
all
potential
factors
in
the
universe
we
will
take
the
very
latest
of
these
speculations
in
supplementing
both
the
darwinian
theory
and
the
grander
speculation
of
laplace
the
scientists
so
called
tell
us
that
the
process
of
aggregation
or
the
turning
out
of
new
worlds
in
the
universe
is
still
going
on
but
that
the
time
is
coming
when
all
the
primeval
potency
or
energy
originally
inhering
in
diffused
matter
will
have
exhausted
itself
in
actual
energy
and
that
then
all
light
life
and
motion
in
the
universe
will
cease
and
be
at
an
end
this
dissipation
of
potential
energy
is
to
result
they
say
in
a
universe
as
it
has
already
resulted
they
claim
in
a
moon
if
not
countless
other
heavenly
bodies
all
the
exterior
planets
or
a
majority
of
them
at
least
are
to
be
placed
in
this
category
of
dismantled
worlds
or
those
in
which
all
life
has
hopelessly
ceased
and
become
extinct
all
has
utterly
disappeared
or
to
paraphrase
one
of
pope
couplets
beast
bird
fish
insect
what
no
eye
can
scan
nor
glass
can
reach
from
zoophyte
to
man
all
these
dismantled
planets
and
satellites
to
planets
are
only
so
many
immense
cinders
mere
refuse
slag
of
no
conceivable
interest
to
science
except
to
predicate
the
ultimate
conclusion
a
universe
resulting
from
a
potency
within
the
universe
the
magnificent
clockwork
of
the
heavens
will
then
have
run
down
with
no
darwinian
whirligig
to
wind
it
up
again
and
the
terrible
reality
of
byron
dream
which
it
would
seem
was
not
all
a
dream
be
realized
in
the
bright
sun
extinguished
the
stars
darkling
the
eternal
space
rayless
and
pathless
and
the
icy
earth
swung
blind
and
blackening
in
the
moonless
air
oh
if
this
be
science
give
us
anything
in
place
of
it
bigotry
in
his
cloistered
den
mumbling
unintelligible
prayers
and
believing
that
man
is
to
be
saved
not
by
what
he
does
but
by
a
only
is
far
preferable
to
it
but
oh
how
unspeakably
preferable
the
simple
faith
of
the
magi
who
deeming
the
light
that
in
the
east
was
seen
an
earnest
and
a
prophecy
of
rest
to
weary
wanderers
such
as
they
had
been
came
on
that
bleak
december
night
years
ago
to
pay
their
homage
to
the
the
long
expected
messiah
the
redeemer
of
the
world
footnotes
it
may
be
proper
however
to
state
that
the
tenth
and
concluding
chapter
was
originally
written
as
a
lecture
and
delivered
about
a
year
ago
in
new
haven
boston
and
at
other
points
a
request
for
its
publication
has
induced
the
author
to
place
it
in
this
volume
with
the
portion
referring
to
the
bible
genesis
omitted
it
will
be
found
germane
to
the
general
subject
without
this
latent
presence
of
the
am
all
modes
of
existence
in
the
external
world
flit
before
us
as
colored
shadows
with
no
greater
depth
root
or
fixure
than
the
image
of
a
rock
hath
in
the
gliding
stream
or
the
rainbow
on
the
rain
storm
on
and
science
that
is
not
purely
inductive
primarily
based
on
the
inviolability
of
our
intuitions
is
no
science
at
all
but
the
sheerest
possible
speculation
this
presence
of
an
active
living
principle
in
nature
one
originally
assigned
as
the
particula
of
every
living
thing
is
frequently
referred
to
in
the
higher
inspirational
moods
of
our
poets
wordsworth
exquisitely
refers
to
it
in
the
following
lines
of
his
excursion
to
every
form
of
being
is
assigned
an
principle
removed
from
sense
and
observation
it
subsists
in
all
things
in
all
nature
in
the
stars
of
azure
heaven
the
unenduring
clouds
in
flower
and
tree
in
every
pebbly
stone
that
paves
the
brooks
the
existence
of
vital
units
is
conceded
by
some
of
the
staunchest
materialists
such
as
herbert
spencer
professor
bastian
and
others
professor
bastian
says
the
countless
myriads
of
living
units
which
have
been
evolved
in
different
ages
of
the
world
history
must
in
each
period
have
given
rise
to
innumerable
multitudes
of
what
have
been
called
of
life
he
insists
however
that
they
have
been
evolved
from
something
or
by
some
unknown
process
but
we
shall
show
further
on
that
a
unit
can
neither
be
nor
and
that
this
is
as
true
of
vital
units
as
of
the
mathematical
or
chemical
unit
neither
evolution
nor
involution
will
ever
effect
the
value
of
a
unit
according
to
aristotle
the
great
is
the
constant
the
definition
which
professor
robinson
in
his
lexicon
of
the
new
testament
gives
of
the
word
σπέρμα
as
connected
with
the
divine
life
entirely
harmonizes
with
this
view
of
the
subject
he
says

το

professor
schmidt
of
the
university
of
strasburg
who
insists
that
species
are
only
relatively
stable
admits
that
they
remain
persistent
as
long
as
they
exist
under
the
same
external
conditions
time
is
therefore
not
a
factor
in
the
mutation
of
species
nor
are
environing
conditions
factors
except
as
a
failure
of
conditions
results
in
the
disappearance
of

as
the
presence
of

results
in

and
this
is
the
universal
claim
of
the
materialists
professor
burdach
as
trad
par
jourdan
in
speaking
of
the
productive
power
of

says

this
shows
that
its
author
believed
in
the
possibility
of
the
superior
organic
forms
like
the
mastodon
megatherium
etc
from
the
heterogenetic
elements
those
undergoing
every
conceivable
change
as
well
as
the
inferior
forms
at
all
events
it
is
a
legitimate
induction
from
materialistic
premises
this
point
is
conclusively
made
by
professor
burdach
who
says
we
quote
from
jourdan
la
tendance
interieure
á
la
configuration

avant
sa
manifestation
and
by
his
he
must
mean
some
vital
or
other
law
equivalent
to
an
in
matter
which
results
not
manifestation
goethe
borrowed
his
idea
of
an
archetypal
world
from
plato
and
the
eleatic
school
they
held
that
the
world
was
originated
and
not
eternal
that
it
was
framed
by
the
creator
after
a
perfect
archetype
one
eternally
existing
in
the
divine
mind
if
not
an
actual
of
which
our
own
is
but
the
reflex
in
a
note
to
bastian
beginnings
of
life
vol
ii
an
important
fact
is
mentioned
as
obtained
from
the
writings
of
schneider
to
wit
that
microscopical
forms
may
be
obtained
at
will
almost
as
readily
as
mushrooms
by
a
process
entirely
independent
of
spores
for
instance
small
pieces
of
beef
were
carefully
examined
to
see
if
they
contained
any
of
the
ova
of
nematoids
and
finding
none
they
were
buried
in
a
small
quantity
of
earth
also
carefully
examined
for
the
presence
of
nematoids
or
their
ova
in
a
gallipot
after
three
weeks
says
b
this
earth
was
found
to
be
absolutely
swarming
with
two
kinds
of
nematoids
quite
different
from
any
forms
which
i
had
previously
seen
although
i
had
been
seeking
them
for
more
than
two
years
previously
in
all
sorts
of
situations
the
reason
why
he
had
not
found
them
previously
was
because
the
necessary
conditions
for
their
appearance
had
not
been
obtained
by
him
or
he
had
not
sought
for
them
in
their
proper
environment
they
were
not
produced
at
will
but
were
the
natural
outgrowth
of
conditions
as
much
so
as
the
spores
of
fungi
which
make
their
appearance
whenever
and
wherever
the
necessary
environing
conditions
exist
according
to
gros
it
takes
about
three
weeks
for
these
nematoid
forms
to
develop
into
a
reproductive
state
the
necessity
of
turning
plants
and
animals
into
tramps
is
just
as
great
in
the
case
of
evolution
as
in
that
of
specific
creation
in
pairs
in
both
cases
we
must
insist
upon
geneological
consanguinity
for
the
chances
of
any
two
highly
specialized
forms
originally
starting
on
different
lines
of
divergence
and
ultimately
reaching
individual
identity
both
in
form
and
characteristics
is
an
impossible
problem
in
the
determination
of
chances
consequently
darwin
finds
the
necessity
of
accounting
for
the
presence
of
northern
forms
in
the
southern
hemisphere
and
the
reverse
just
as
great
as
in
the
linnæan
theory
which
was
fully
accepted
by
cuvier
burdach
in
his
physiologie
trad
par
says
effectivement
nous
rencontrons
des
traces
de
vie
dans
toute
existence
quelconque
this
is
as
broad
a
panspermic
statement
as
can
be
made
and
is
only
true
of
inorganic
matter
so
far
as
vegetable
life
is
concerned
including
such
infusorial
mycologic
and
cryptogamic
forms
as
may
lie
so
near
to
the
force
vegetative
of
needham
as
to
be
indistinguishable
from
it
in
the
case
of
volcanic
islands
the
upheavals
were
undoubtedly
accompanied
by
deposits
of
mud
sand
ocean
detritus
marine
vegetation
and
more
or
less
animal
matter
and
these
organic
substances
were
washed
down
by
the
rains
into
the
broken
valleys
and
plains
below
when
land
vegetation
almost
immediately
made
its
appearance
not
because
seeds
may
have
drifted
thither
by
any
of
the
different
agencies
that
have
been
mentioned
but
because
organic
matter
can
no
more
help
bringing
forth
life
in
some
form
when
conditions
favor
than
salt
water
when
exposed
to
evaporation
can
help
crystallizing
into
its
salts
and
the
same
would
be
true
of
all
the
coral
islands
bringing
up
the
organic
matter
of
the
sea
to
the
influence
of
the
light
the
rains
and
the
dews
the
islands
thus
formed
in
the
pacific
ocean
begin
to
exhibit
vegetable
life
almost
as
soon
as
they
make
their
appearance
above
the
reefs
and
a
line
of
is
formed
about
them
these
while
presenting
the
most
varied
and
diverse
forms
of
infusorial
life
are
nevertheless
the
most
constant
and
abundant
type
they
abound
more
or
less
in
all
organic
infusions
ehrenberg
however
holds
that
they
are
no
more
animal
than
vegetal
forms
they
vary
in
length
from
to
of
an
inch
and
are
consequently
too
minute
to
be
satisfactorily
classified
in
respect
to
all
their
diversified
characteristics
the
extent
of
the
southern
may
at
least
be
approximately
reached
from
explorations
already
made
capt
weddell
in
extended
his
explorations
southward
to
within
about
of
the
south
pole
where
he
found
an
open
sea
capt
ross
in
approached
to
within
about
of
the
same
pole
without
serious
obstruction
it
is
true
that
in
the
following
year
he
encountered
ice
barriers
near
the
line
of
the
antarctic
circle
but
they
were
floating
barriers
coming
down
from
weddell
open
sea
capt
wilkes
in
explored
a
considerable
portion
of
the
antarctic
continent
lying
almost
entirely
within
the
antarctic
circle
other
explorations
have
been
made
showing
that
the
southern
does
not
probably
extend
continuously
at
least
much
farther
north
than
or
or
to
within
some
ten
or
twelve
degrees
of
the
south
pole
independently
of
the
packs
of
drifting
ice
in
the
otherwise
open
seas
the
truth
or
falsity
of
evolution
depends
entirely
on
the
successful
solution
of
this
problem
for
the
chances
are
quintillions
to
ones
that
no
two
identical
forms
could
have
originated
from
different
centres
or
from
the
same
centre
on
divergent
lines
and
ever
reached
identically
the
same
results
and
how
any
two
forms
should
happen
to
be
sexually
paired
on
the
same
or
different
lines
of
divergence
is
one
of
those
inexplicable
mysteries
which
must
puzzle
herbert
spencer
in
all
his
labyrinthian
searches
into
differentiation
the
dynamic
force
of
molecules
etc
however
successful
he
may
be
in
other
directions
he
will
inevitably
fail
in
this
we
must
fall
back
on
the
grand
old
bible
genesis
for
the
solution
of
this
difficulty
where
every
living
thing
was
commanded
to
produce
seed
or
multiply
and
replenish
the
waters
and
the
earth
with
offspring
these
transcendental
or
ideal
forms
may
be
said
to
correspond
to
the
spiritual
essences
of
plato
they
are
the
eternal
immutable
principles
which
are
discernible
to
the
eye
of
the
soul
as
the
sensible
objects
they
represent
are
discernible
to
the
eye
of
the
body
modern
metaphysics
may
deem
them
mere
abstractions
but
a
higher
realistic
philosophy
will
treat
them
as
substantive
forms
of
which
the
objective
reality
is
but
the
shadow
herbert
spencer
may
be
quoted
as
authority
on
this
point
he
says
there
is
invariably
and
necessarily
a
conformity
between
the
vital
functions
of
any
organism
and
the
in
which
it
is
placed
we
find
that
every
animal
is
limited
to
a
certain
range
of
climate
every
plant
to
certain
zones
of
latitude
and
elevation
and
the
same
law
holds
good
as
to
the
marine
fauna
and
flora
each
specific
form
being
confined
to
its
own
or
distance
north
or
south
from
the
thermal
equator
speaking
of
the
ultimate
principles
or
elements
of
matter
plato
is
quoted
by
humboldt
as
exclaiming
with
modest
diffidence
god
alone
and
those
whom
he
loves
among
men
know
what
they
are
it
is
only
those
who
seek
to
eliminate
god
from
the
universe
that
speak
with
confident
flippancy
on
the
subject
of
molecular
machinery
and
as
long
as
the
evolutionists
can
not
agree
among
themselves
as
to
what
constitutes
the
process
of
evolution
it
can
hardly
be
expected
that
the
public
will
accept
their
speculations
as
conclusive
inductions
professor
bastian
who
strongly
commits
himself
to
the
doctrine
thinks
the
word
evolution
arbitrary
and
open
to
many
objections
while
herbert
spencer
says
the
antithetical
word
involution
would
much
more
truly
express
the
nature
of
the
process
know
ye
not
that
ye
are
the
temple
of
god
and
that
the
spirit
of
god
dwelleth
in
you
cor
xvi
drysdale
in
his
work
on
the
protoplasmic
theory
of
life
says
matter
can
not
change
its
state
of
motion
or
rest
without
the
influence
of
some
force
from
without
true
spontaneity
of
movement
is
therefore
just
as
impossible
to
it
as
to
what
we
call
dead
matter
so
we
are
compelled
to
admit
the
existence
of
an
exciting
cause
in
the
form
of
some
force
from
without
to
give
the
initial
impulse
in
all
vital
actions
in
all
this
force
from
without
must
be
a
vital
principle
operating
to
effect
the
otherwise
impossible
change
in
matter
a
favorite
of
professor
bastian
in
speaking
of
morphological
cells
or
units
as
he
sometimes
calls
them
that
great
and
justly
celebrated
naturalist
buffon
in
speaking
of
the
universal
origination
of
the
lower
forms
of
animal
life
by
a
process
termed
in
his
time
spontaneous
generation
says
there
are
perhaps
as
many
living
things
both
animal
and
vegetable
which
are
produced
by
the
fortuitous
aggregations
of
organiques
as
there
are
others
which
reproduce
themselves
by
a
constant
succession
of
generations
it
is
said
that
buffon
was
for
some
time
associated
with
the
abbé
needham
in
his
experiments
in
vital
directions
and
was
much
influenced
by
them
so
that
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
he
did
not
accept
the
abbé
force
végétative
in
place
of
his
more
materialistic
views
respecting
molécules
organiques
at
all
events
his
statement
that
as
many
living
things
appear
in
nature
independently
of
reproducing
causes
as
by
successive
generation
is
no
doubt
true
tréviranus
who
followed
spallanzani
and
bonnet
in
these
flask
experimentations
first
noticed
the
important
fact
that
the
animalculæ
appearing
in
different
organic
infusions
depended
on
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
infusions
themselves
and
that
the
changed
conditions
of
the
same
infusion
produced
new
and
independent
forms
of
life

here
is
a
fact
given
us
by
hall
of
wallingford
in
a
peat
meadow
in
that
town
owned
by
him
which
was
at
no
time
subject
to
overflow
a
large
quantity
of
peat
had
been
removed
at
different
intervals
of
time
when
the
excavations
naturally
filled
with
water
in
these
excavations
there
appeared
not
only
the
in
considerable
numbers
but
fresh
water
clams
which
grew
to
be
as
large
as
those
in
the
most
favored
streams
they
made
their
appearance
the
very
first
season
after
the
peat
was
removed
and
have
flourished
there
ever
since
in
no
other
portions
of
the
meadow
were
there
any
fish
or
clams
ever
noticed
before
nor
was
there
any
other
source
of
than
the
in
that
locality
professor
beale
in
one
of
his
very
latest
works
says
of
the
chemical
and
physical
forms
of
energy
something
is
known
but
of
the
relationship
of
the
so
called
energy
nothing
has
been
proved
we
only
know
that
the
influence
it
exerts
is
altogether
different
from
that
which
has
been
traced
to
physical
and
chemical
energy
it
is
admitted
even
in
the
case
of
whose
movements
are
the
most
uniform
that
they
are
sometimes
so
inert
and
languid
as
to
show
no
movements
at
all
while
at
other
times
they
exhibit
mere
brownian
movements
or
those
no
more
nearly
allied
to
life
than
the
minute
particles
of
carbon
escaping
from
the
flame
of
a
kerosene
lamp
and
among
the
most
distinguished
microscopists
it
is
a
question
whether
these
infusorial
forms
those
exhibiting
the
most
active
oscillations
are
really
vegetal
or
animal
in
origin
in
other
words
whether
they
are
or
or
whether
they
may
not
be
some
intermediate
forms
the
difficulty
of
assigning
any
definitional
value
to
a
primordial
germ
is
due
to
the
vagueness
of
idea
attached
to
it
in
the
popular
mind
as
well
as
to
the
diversified
theories
and
speculations
of
the
scientists
concerning
the
origin
of
life
we
can
only
define
it
as
a
vital
unit
as
the
chemist
defines
his
smallest
conceivable
quantity
his
primary
least
of
an
element
as
a
chemical
unit
let
two
comrades
be
shot
at
the
same
instant
in
battle
the
one
through
the
heart
and
the
other
through
the
arm
shattering
it
badly
what
is
there
to
prevent
the
surgeon
from
taking
a
piece
of
bone
out
of
the
arm
of
the
man
shot
through
the
heart
and
instantly
killed
and
using
it
to
make

the

of
the

still
living
apparently
nothing

that
the
dead

bone
will
not
knit
he
may
not
have
been

five
minutes
and
professor
beale
bioplasts
might
still
be
at
work
spinning
matter
and
weaving
tissue
for
the
integrity
of
the
displaced
bone
why
will
it
not
knit
simply
because
the
vital
principle
that
differentiates
matter
is
gone
can
no
longer
act
if
the
integrity
of
the
bone
depended
on
the
action
of
the
molecules
and
not
on
the
vital
principle
there
is
no
reason
why
this
experiment
should
not
be
a
success
for
the
molecules
are
all
there
and
their
action
will
not
be
disturbed
for
hours
after
the
death
of
the
man
shot
through
the
heart
it
is
safe
to
adhere
to
the
leibnitzian
axiom
non
agit
one
of
the
most
cultured
classes
of
christian
believers
in
our
day
holds
that
all
life
is
from
the
lord
that
he
is
the
fountain
and
we
only
the
streams
thence
and
this
they
claim
is
true
of
all
life
to
take
away
our
breath
therefore
is
to
cut
off
this
stream
perpetually
flowing
from
its
invisible
source
the
fountain
of
all
life
when
scientific
methods
substitute
for
a
first
cause
a
mere
resultant

all
primary
principles
disappear
in
their
intermediates
professor
marsh
of
yale
college
has
predicted
that
the
missing

will
be
found
in
borneo
evidently
not
crediting
statement
about
its
presence
in
the
interior
of
africa
but
one
missing
link
is
hardly
enough
there
ought
to
be
an
extensive
family
of
them

the

to
the

a
distance
which
does
not
half
cover
the
length
of
this
plexus
the
immense
gap
between
the
monkey
and
the
man
being
decidedly
the
greater
length
of
chain
and
yet
the
first
half
of

is
traversed
by
innumerable

millions
of

so
to
speak
how
then
is
the
greater
length
of
the
plexus
to
be
covered
by
a
single
missing
link
a
long
line
of
caudal
ancestry
must
be
dug
up
therefore
in
borneo
and
shipped
to
the
peabody
museum
before
this
tremendous
stretch
in
the
chain
of
animated
nature
is
satisfactorily
accounted
for
borneo
must
be
exceedingly
rich
in
osteologic
remains
even
to
bridge
the
chasm
between
its
own
and
the
dyaks
or
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
that
island
this
daring
hypothesis
of
the
materialists
is
so
utterly
repugnant
to
all
our
ideas
of
a
perfected
cosmos
that
we
have
no
patience
with
those
advancing
it
it
is
at
best
speculation
run
mad
and
is
based
on
no
other
assumption
than
that
of
the
inherent
imperfectibility
of
the
universe
as
it
came
from
the
hand
of
god
or
from
the
dynamic
play
of
molecules
extending
throughout
vast
geognostic
epochs
from
a
materialistic
this
assumption
of
imperfectibility
inevitably
runs
into
the
ad
for
if
in
the
play
of
the
material
forces
of
the
universe
an
infinite
duration
of
past
time
has
effected
nothing
but
mutually
disturbing
and
movements
and
relations
among
cosmical
bodies
then
an
infinite
duration
of
time
to
come
can
effect
nothing
but
similarly
mutual
adjustments
and
in
respect
to
such
bodies
with
an
infinity
of
time
space
matter
and
motion
everywhere
presenting
a
unity
of
phenomena
in
the
universe
there
can
never
be
anything
according
to
the
great
stagirite
unconnected
or
out
of
place
as
in
a
bad
tragedy
conservation
must
therefore
be
the
rule
and
desinence
the
impossible
exception
but
these
adherents
of
inherent
imperfectibility
instance
the
fact
of
vanished
and
variable
stars
as
well
as
those
that
have
suddenly
appeared
and
after
brief
periods
of
intense
brilliancy
as
suddenly
disappeared
to
show
that
there
are
mighty
disturbances
in
the
sidereal
heavens
which
entirely
negative
the
idea
of
conservation
as
a
geognostic
law
but
the
phenomena
of
variable
stars
with
all
their
apparent
irregularity
of
motion
and
fluctuations
in
luminosity
are
now
being
traced
to
definite
and
laws
of
motion
if
not
of
light
while
the
theory
of
extinguished
and
disappearing
stars
belongs
exclusive
to
the
age
of
tycho
brahe
where
there
is
one
body
or
sun
in
the
interstellary
spaces
there
are
probably
not
less
than
forty
or
dark
cosmical
bodies
revolving
about
their
respective
centres
of
light
and
heat
as
the
attending
planets
revolve
about
the
common
centre
of
gravity
in
our
own
system
and
this
is
especially
true
of
that
vast
and
fathomless
called
the
in
which
most
of
these
peculiar
phenomena
occur
with
the
exception
of
the
variable
stars
only
that
stars
should
vary
in
their
intensity
of
light
by
the
probable
transits
of
these
dark
cosmical
bodies
across
their
discs
is
no
matter
of
wonder
or
astonishment
on
the
contrary
it
is
surprising
that
these
sidereal
phenomena
do
not
occur
with
much
greater
frequency
this
would
inevitably
be
the
case
if
the
planes
of
revolution
in
the
case
of
these
bodies
about
their
central
orbs
were
coincident
with
the
lines
of
vision
from
our
own
planet
a
circumstance
by
no
means
improbable
from
the
vastness
of
the
sidereal
heavens
and
the
innumerable
hosts
of
stars
marching
therein
besides
these
periodical
variations
may
be
accounted
for
in
part
especially
in
the
case
of
double
stars
from
their
apparent
rather
than
real
change
of
place
in
the
heavens
for
if
our
is
travelling
towards
a
point
in
the
constellation
hercules
at
the
rate
of
thousand
miles
an
hour
the
rapidity
of
arcturus
flight
it
is
impossible
to
determine
in
the
present
state
of
astronomical
knowledge
whether
the
apparent
change
of
place
in
any
star
is
real
or
merely
optical
but
in
the
case
of
double
stars
each
is
travelling
independently
of
its
other
motions
about
the
common
centre
of
gravity
obtaining
in
its
own
system
and
these
relative
movements
may
account
for
the
greater
or
less
intensity
of
light
as
the
two
stars
viewed
as
one
present
a
greater
or
less
area
of
luminosity
in
their
united
surfaces
the
assumed
revolution
of
one
of
these
stars
about
the
other
thus
destroying
all
the
known
analogies
of
the
universe
as
exemplified
in
our
own
system
may
be
accounted
for
in
the
same
way
with
stupendous
planetary
systems
revolving
about
each
of
these
apparently
double
stars
they
must
respectively
have
a
revolution
real
as
well
as
apparent
about
their
own
centres
of
gravity
not
one
and
the
same
centre
but
different
and
far
distant
centres
lying
in
nearly
the
same
line
of
vision
with
planes
of
movement
at
right
angles
with
it
they
would
necessarily
present
the
appearance
of
one
star
revolving
about
the
other
an
motion
only
and
the
writer
here
ventures
an
explanation
of
the
phenomena
of
stars
or
those
making
their
appearance
in
the
heavens
flaming
up
into
stars
of
the
first
second
and
third
magnitudes
and
then
disappearing
altogether
the
most
remarkable
of
these
stars
or
stars
was
that
of
tycho
brahe
in
presenting
its
maximum
brilliancy
at
the
very
first
but
gradually
diminishing
in
size
until
the
end
of
seventeen
months
when
it
disappeared
without
change
of
place
from
the
heavens
this
temporary
star
was
visible
in
cassiopeia
on
the
verge
of
the
within
whose
swarm
of
stellar
worlds
most
of
these
apparent
stars
have
made
their
appearance
tycho
brahe
in
seeking
to
account
for
this
stellar
phenomenon
advanced
the
theory
that
stars
might
be
formed
and
molded
out
of
cosmical
vapor
or
vapory
celestial
matter
as
the
elder
herschel
put
it
which
becomes
luminous
as
it
condenses
conglomerates
into
fixed
stars
but
any
such
rapid
condensation
of
vapory
matter
in
the
light
of
laplace
nebular
theory
is
manifestly
too
absurd
for
scientific
recognition
a
more
satisfactory
explanation
may
be
here
suggested
supposing
the
apparent
relative
position
of
any
six
or
seven
stars
of
the
sixth
magnitude
in
the
should
be
so
changed
by
the
combined
motions
of
our
and
of
the
stars
themselves
as
to
throw
them
into
one
and
the
same
line
of
vision
but
so
clustered
together
as
to
show
their
several
as
one
we
should
unquestionably
have
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
which
would
continue
as
long
as
this
extraordinary
stellar
conjunction
should
last
as
one
after
another
of
these
stars
should
fall
out
of
line
by
reason
of
the
combined
motions
named
the
apparent
star
would
be
diminished
from
the
first
to
the
second
magnitude
and
so
on
until
it
reached
the
sixth
magnitude
when
it
would
pass
beyond
the
reach
of
unaided
human
vision
but
as
the
star
of
tycho
brahe
suddenly
appeared
at
its
fullest
brilliancy
it
may
be
objected
that
this
suggested
theory
fails
to
meet
the
required
conditions
as
out
of
the
of
telescopic
stars
lie
in
the
it
is
not
by
any
means
improbable
that
such
a
conjunction
of
stars
may
occur
therein
as
often
at
least
as
once
or
twice
in
a
century
we
certainly
see
brilliant
patches
of
stars
in
great
numbers
in
this
galactic
zone
and
the
fact
that
these
temporary
stars
almost
uniformly
appear
in
that
zone
renders
the
suggestion
here
made
quite
as
rational
in
the
way
of
speculation
at
least
as
that
of
vapory
celestial
matter
suddenly
condensed
into
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
as
sir
william
herschel
would
have
us
believe
was
possible
if
not
probable
besides
it
is
a
definitely
ascertained
fact
that
such
clusters
of
stars
lying
in
almost
the
same
line
of
vision
exist
in
various
parts
of
the
heavens
which
present
to
the
naked
eye
the
appearance
of
a
star
of
the
fourth
or
fifth
magnitude
and
probably
would
if
more
thickly
clustered
present
that
of
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
but
powerful
telescopes
resolve
them
into
a
large
number
of
stars
from
the
thirteenth
to
the
fifteenth
magnitude
one
such
cluster
in
andromeda
girdle
has
been
resolved
into
not
less
than
fifteen
hundred
small
stars
of
very
low
magnitude
and
pretty
widely
scattered
in
the
telescopic
field
alexander
von
humboldt
in
speaking
of
stars
that
have
thus
disappeared
says
that
their
disappearance
may
be
the
result
of
their
motion
as
much
as
of
any
diminution
of
their
photometric
processes
whether
on
their
surfaces
or
in
their
photospheres
as
would
render
the
waves
of
light
too
weak
too
excite
the
organs
of
sight
and
he
adds
what
we
no
longer
see
is
not
necessarily
annihilation
repeating
at
the
same
time
the
question
of
pliny
an
obirent
nascerenturve
but
another
and
to
our
mind
more
satisfactory
explanation
of
these
stellar
phenomena
may
be
hazarded
in
this
connection
there
are
for
instance
in
the
among
the
more
brilliant
clusters
of
stars
dark
granular
spots
of
greater
or
less
magnitude
in
which
the
most
powerful
telescopes
show
no
glints
or
traces
of
stars
they
are
among
humboldt
smaller
fissures
or
chasms
in
the
heavens
in
which
he
asserts
that
there
is
a
great
paucity
of
stars
or
none
at
all
now
if
one
of
these
thick
stellar
clusters
which
show
to
the
naked
eye
as
a
single
star
should
by
the
combined
cosmical
movements
of
our
and
the
stellar
group
in
question
pass
into
the
field
of
one
of
these
small
rents
or
fissures
in
the
galactic
curtain
that
lying
in
front
of
the
stellar
cluster
it
would
immediately
show
as
a
star
of
possibly
the
first
magnitude
and
would
continue
to
shine
as
a
star
of
that
magnitude
so
long
as
it
remained
in
the
field
of
the
narrow
rent
or
fissure
it
would
shine
out
suddenly
like
a
star
through
a
rift
in
the
clouds
of
a
dark
night
and
disappear
as
soon
as
it
had
traversed
or
apparently
traversed
the
rift
in
question
this
galactic
curtain
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
is
made
up
of
of
stars
or
and
not
less
than
dark
cosmical
bodies
revolving
about
their
respective
centres
of
gravity
if
the
nebular
theory
of
the
universe
be
true
this
is
unquestionably
the
exact
condition
of
things
in
the
of
the
more
distant
stars
in
this
crowded
galaxy
we
can
only
catch
even
in
the
telescopic
field
mere
glints
of
light
as
the
intervening
swarms
of
stellar
and
planetary
worlds
thicken
in
the
foreground
and
shut
out
the
more
distant
view
it
is
only
through
these
rents
and
fissures
in
this
great
galactic
curtain
that
the
brighter
stellar
clusters
beyond
can
ever
be
seen
and
these
glints
of
far
distant
light
showing
dimly
through
this
curtain
may
account
for
the
peculiar
appearance
of
the
galaxy
arising
from
the
loss
of
chromatic
power
in
the
full
beams
themselves
it
was
undoubtedly
through
one
of
these
rents
in
the
galactic
curtain
that
the
condensed
starry
cluster
of
tycho
brahe
suddenly
made
its
appearance
in
the
outer
fringes
of
the
and
remained
visible
for
a
period
of
seventeen
months
