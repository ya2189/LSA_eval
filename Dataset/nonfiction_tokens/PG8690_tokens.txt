advertisement
the
american
publishers
of
de
tocqueville
democracy
in
america
have
been
frequently
solicited
to
furnish
the
work
in
a
form
adapted
to
seminaries
of
learning
and
at
a
price
which
would
secure
its
more
general
circulation
and
enable
trustees
of
school
district
libraries
and
other
libraries
to
place
it
among
their
collections
desirous
to
attain
these
objects
they
have
consulted
several
gentlemen
in
whose
judgment
they
confided
and
particularly
the
editor
of
the
american
editions
to
ascertain
whether
the
work
was
capable
of
abridgment
or
condensation
so
as
to
bring
the
expense
of
its
publication
within
the
necessary
limits
they
are
advised
that
the
nature
of
the
work
renders
it
impossible
to
condense
it
by
omitting
any
remarks
or
illustrations
of
the
author
upon
any
subject
discussed
by
him
even
if
common
justice
to
him
did
not
forbid
any
such
attempt
and
that
the
only
mode
of
reducing
its
bulk
is
to
exclude
wholly
such
subjects
as
are
deemed
not
to
be
essential
it
will
be
recollected
that
the
first
volume
was
originally
published
separately
and
was
complete
in
itself
it
treated
of
the
influence
of
democracy
upon
the
political
institutions
of
the
united
states
and
exhibited
views
of
the
nature
of
our
government
and
of
their
complicated
machinery
so
new
so
striking
and
so
just
as
to
excite
the
admiration
and
even
the
wonder
of
our
countrymen
it
was
universally
admitted
to
be
the
best
if
not
the
first
systematic
and
philosophic
view
of
the
great
principles
of
our
constitutions
which
has
been
presented
to
the
world
as
a
treatise
upon
the
spirit
of
our
governments
it
was
full
and
finished
and
was
deemed
worthy
of
being
introduced
as
a
in
some
of
our
seminaries
of
learning
the
publication
of
the
first
volume
alone
would
therefore
seem
to
be
sufficient
to
accomplish
in
the
main
the
objects
of
the
publishers
above
stated
and
upon
a
careful
of
the
second
volume
this
impression
is
confirmed
it
is
entirely
independent
of
the
first
volume
and
is
in
no
way
essential
to
a
full
understanding
of
the
principles
and
views
contained
in
that
volume
it
discusses
the
effects
of
the
democratic
principle
upon
the
tastes
feelings
habits
and
manners
of
the
americans
and
although
deeply
interesting
and
valuable
yet
the
observations
of
the
author
on
these
subjects
are
better
calculated
for
foreign
countries
than
for
our
own
citizens
as
he
wrote
for
europe
they
were
necessary
to
his
plan
they
follow
naturally
and
properly
the
profound
views
which
had
already
been
presented
and
which
they
carry
out
and
illustrate
but
they
furnish
no
new
developments
of
those
views
nor
any
facts
that
would
be
new
to
us
the
publishers
were
therefore
advised
that
the
printing
of
the
first
volume
complete
and
entire
was
the
only
mode
of
attaining
the
object
they
had
in
view
they
have
accordingly
determined
to
adopt
that
course
intending
if
the
public
sentiment
should
require
it
hereafter
to
print
the
second
volume
in
the
same
style
so
that
both
may
be
had
at
the
same
moderate
price
a
few
notes
in
addition
to
those
contained
in
the
former
editions
have
been
made
by
the
american
editor
which
upon
a
reperusal
of
the
volume
seemed
useful
if
not
necessary
and
some
statistical
results
of
the
census
of
have
been
added
in
connection
with
similar
results
given
by
the
author
from
returns
previous
to
that
year
preface
to
the
american
edition
the
following
work
of
de
tocqueville
has
attracted
great
attention
throughout
europe
where
it
is
universally
regarded
as
a
sound
philosophical
impartial
and
remarkably
clear
and
distinct
view
of
our
political
institutions
and
of
our
manners
opinions
and
habits
as
influencing
or
influenced
by
those
institutions
writers
reviewers
and
statesmen
of
all
parties
have
united
in
the
highest
commendations
of
its
ability
and
integrity
the
people
described
by
a
work
of
such
a
character
should
not
be
the
only
one
in
christendom
unacquainted
with
its
contents
at
least
so
thought
many
of
our
most
distinguished
men
who
have
urged
the
publishers
of
this
edition
to
reprint
the
work
and
present
it
to
the
american
public
they
have
done
so
in
the
hope
of
promoting
among
their
countrymen
a
more
thorough
knowledge
of
their
frames
of
government
and
a
more
just
appreciation
of
the
great
principles
on
which
they
are
founded
but
it
seemed
to
them
that
a
reprint
in
america
of
the
views
of
an
author
so
well
entitled
to
regard
and
confidence
without
any
correction
of
the
few
errors
or
mistakes
that
might
be
found
would
be
in
effect
to
give
authenticity
to
the
whole
work
and
that
foreign
readers
especially
would
consider
silence
under
such
circumstances
as
strong
evidence
of
the
accuracy
of
its
statements
the
preface
to
the
english
edition
too
was
not
adapted
to
this
country
having
been
written
as
it
would
seem
in
reference
to
the
political
questions
which
agitate
great
britain
the
publishers
therefore
applied
to
the
writer
of
this
to
furnish
them
with
a
short
preface
and
such
notes
upon
the
text
as
might
appear
necessary
to
correct
any
erroneous
impressions
having
had
the
honor
of
a
personal
acquaintance
with
de
tocqueville
while
he
was
in
this
country
having
discussed
with
him
many
of
the
topics
treated
of
in
this
book
having
entered
deeply
into
the
feelings
and
sentiments
which
guided
and
impelled
him
in
his
task
and
having
formed
a
high
admiration
of
his
character
and
of
this
production
the
writer
felt
under
some
obligation
to
aid
in
procuring
for
one
whom
he
ventures
to
call
his
friend
a
hearing
from
those
who
were
the
subjects
of
his
observations
these
circumstances
furnish
to
his
own
mind
an
apology
for
undertaking
what
no
one
seemed
willing
to
attempt
notwithstanding
his
want
of
practice
in
literary
composition
and
notwithstanding
the
impediments
of
professional
avocations
constantly
recurring
and
interrupting
that
strict
and
continued
examination
of
the
work
which
became
necessary
as
well
to
detect
any
errors
of
the
author
as
any
misunderstanding
or
misrepresentation
of
his
meaning
by
his
translator
if
the
same
circumstances
will
atone
in
the
least
for
the
imperfections
of
what
the
editor
has
contributed
to
this
edition
and
will
serve
to
mitigate
the
severity
of
judgment
upon
those
contributions
it
is
all
he
can
hope
or
ask
the
notes
are
confined
with
very
few
exceptions
to
the
correction
of
what
appeared
to
be
misapprehensions
of
the
author
in
regard
to
some
matters
of
fact
or
some
principles
of
law
and
to
explaining
his
meaning
where
the
translator
had
misconceived
it
for
the
latter
purpose
the
original
was
consulted
and
it
affords
great
pleasure
to
bear
witness
to
the
general
fidelity
with
which
reeve
has
transferred
the
author
ideas
from
french
into
english
he
has
not
been
a
literal
translator
and
this
has
been
the
cause
of
the
very
few
errors
which
have
been
discovered
but
he
has
been
more
and
better
he
has
caught
the
spirit
of
de
tocqueville
has
understood
the
sentiment
he
meant
to
express
and
has
clothed
it
in
the
language
which
de
tocqueville
would
have
himself
used
had
he
possessed
equal
facility
in
writing
the
english
language
being
confined
to
the
objects
before
mentioned
the
reader
will
not
find
any
comments
on
the
theoretical
views
of
our
author
he
has
discussed
many
subjects
on
which
very
different
opinions
are
entertained
in
the
united
states
but
with
an
ability
a
candor
and
an
evident
devotion
to
the
cause
of
truth
which
will
commend
his
views
to
those
who
most
radically
dissent
from
them
indeed
readers
of
the
most
discordant
opinions
will
find
that
he
frequently
agrees
with
both
sides
and
as
frequently
differs
from
them
as
an
instance
his
remarks
on
slavery
will
not
be
found
to
coincide
throughout
with
the
opinions
either
of
abolitionists
or
of
slaveholders
but
they
will
be
found
to
present
a
masterly
view
of
a
most
perplexing
and
interesting
subject
which
seems
to
cover
the
whole
ground
and
to
lead
to
the
melancholy
conclusion
of
the
utter
impotency
of
human
effort
to
eradicate
this
acknowledged
evil
but
on
this
and
on
the
various
topics
of
the
deepest
interest
which
are
discussed
in
this
work
it
was
thought
that
the
american
readers
would
be
fully
competent
to
form
their
own
opinions
and
to
detect
any
errors
of
the
author
if
such
there
are
without
any
attempt
of
the
present
editor
to
enlighten
them
at
all
events
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
will
patiently
read
and
candidly
consider
the
views
of
this
accomplished
foreigner
however
hostile
they
may
be
to
their
own
preconceived
opinions
or
prejudices
he
says
there
are
certain
truths
which
americans
can
only
learn
from
strangers
or
from
experience
let
us
then
at
least
listen
to
one
who
admires
us
and
our
institutions
and
whose
complaints
when
he
makes
any
are
that
we
have
not
perfected
our
own
glorious
plans
and
that
there
are
some
things
yet
to
be
amended
we
shall
thus
furnish
a
practical
proof
that
public
opinion
in
this
country
is
not
so
intolerant
as
the
author
may
be
understood
to
represent
it
however
mistaken
he
may
be
his
manly
appeal
to
our
understandings
and
to
our
consciences
should
at
least
be
heard
if
ever
he
says
these
lines
are
read
in
america
i
am
well
assured
of
two
things
in
the
first
place
that
all
who
peruse
them
will
raise
their
voice
to
condemn
me
and
in
the
second
place
that
very
many
of
them
will
acquit
me
at
the
bottom
of
their
consciences
he
is
writing
on
that
very
sore
subject
the
tyranny
of
public
opinion
in
the
united
states
fully
to
comprehend
the
scope
of
the
present
work
the
author
motive
and
object
in
preparing
it
should
be
distinctly
kept
in
view
he
has
written
not
for
america
but
for
france
it
was
not
then
merely
to
satisfy
a
legitimate
curiosity
he
says
that
i
have
examined
america
my
wish
has
been
to
find
instruction
by
which
we
might
ourselves
profit
i
sought
the
image
of
democracy
itself
with
its
inclinations
its
character
its
prejudices
and
its
passions
in
order
to
learn
what
we
have
to
hope
or
fear
from
its
progress
he
thinks
that
the
principle
of
democracy
has
sprung
into
new
life
throughout
europe
and
particularly
in
france
and
that
it
is
advancing
with
a
firm
and
steady
march
to
the
control
of
all
civilized
governments
in
his
own
country
he
had
seen
a
recent
attempt
to
repress
its
energies
within
due
bounds
and
to
prevent
the
consequences
of
its
excesses
and
it
seems
to
be
a
main
object
with
him
to
ascertain
whether
these
bounds
can
be
relied
upon
whether
the
dikes
and
embankments
of
human
contrivance
can
keep
within
any
appointed
channel
this
mighty
and
majestic
stream
giving
the
fullest
confidence
to
his
declaration
that
his
book
is
written
to
favor
no
particular
views
and
with
no
design
of
serving
or
attacking
any
party
it
is
yet
evident
that
his
mind
has
been
very
open
to
receive
impressions
unfavorable
to
the
admission
into
france
of
the
unbounded
and
unlimited
democracy
which
reigns
in
these
united
states
a
knowledge
of
this
inclination
of
his
mind
will
necessarily
induce
some
caution
in
his
readers
while
perusing
those
parts
of
the
work
which
treat
of
the
effects
of
our
democracy
upon
the
stability
of
our
government
and
its
administration
while
the
views
of
the
author
respecting
the
application
of
the
democratic
principle
in
the
extent
that
it
exists
with
us
to
the
institutions
of
france
or
to
any
of
the
european
nations
are
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
people
and
statesmen
of
those
countries
they
are
scarcely
less
entitled
to
the
attention
of
americans
he
has
exhibited
with
admirable
skill
the
causes
and
circumstances
which
prepared
our
forefathers
gradually
for
the
enjoyment
of
free
institutions
and
which
enable
them
to
sustain
without
abusing
the
utmost
liberty
that
was
ever
enjoyed
by
any
people
in
tracing
these
causes
in
examining
how
far
they
continue
to
influence
our
conduct
manners
and
opinions
and
in
searching
for
the
means
of
preventing
their
decay
or
destruction
the
intelligent
american
reader
will
find
no
better
guide
than
de
tocqueville
fresh
from
the
scenes
of
the
three
days
revolution
in
france
the
author
came
among
us
to
observe
carefully
and
critically
the
operation
of
the
new
principle
on
which
the
happiness
of
his
country
and
as
he
seems
to
believe
the
destinies
of
the
civilized
world
depend
filled
with
the
love
of
liberty
but
remembering
the
atrocities
which
in
its
name
had
been
committed
under
former
dynasties
at
home
he
sought
to
discover
the
means
by
which
it
was
regulated
in
america
and
reconciled
with
social
order
by
his
laborious
investigations
and
minute
observations
of
the
history
of
the
settlement
of
the
country
and
of
its
progress
through
the
colonial
state
to
independence
he
found
the
object
of
his
inquiry
in
the
manners
habits
and
opinions
of
a
people
who
had
been
gradually
prepared
by
a
long
course
of
peculiar
circumstances
and
by
their
local
position
for
and
he
has
explained
with
a
pencil
of
light
the
mystery
that
has
baffled
europeans
and
perplexed
americans
he
exhibits
us
in
our
present
condition
a
new
and
to
europeans
a
strange
people
his
views
of
our
political
institutions
are
more
general
comprehensive
and
philosophic
than
have
been
presented
by
any
writer
domestic
or
foreign
he
has
traced
them
from
their
source
democracy
the
power
of
the
people
and
has
steadily
pursued
this
in
all
its
forms
and
modifications
in
the
frame
of
our
governments
in
their
administration
by
the
different
executives
in
our
legislation
in
the
arrangement
of
our
judiciary
in
our
manners
in
religion
in
the
freedom
and
licentiousness
of
the
press
in
the
influence
of
public
opinion
and
in
various
subtle
recesses
where
its
existence
was
scarcely
suspected
in
all
these
he
analyzes
and
dissects
the
tendencies
of
democracy
heartily
applauds
where
he
can
and
faithfully
and
independently
gives
warning
of
dangers
that
he
foresees
no
one
can
read
the
result
of
his
observations
without
better
and
clearer
perceptions
of
the
structure
of
out
governments
of
the
great
pillars
on
which
they
rest
and
of
the
dangers
to
which
they
are
exposed
nor
without
a
more
profound
and
more
intelligent
admiration
of
the
harmony
and
beauty
of
their
formation
and
of
the
safeguards
provided
for
preserving
and
transmitting
them
to
a
distant
posterity
the
more
that
general
and
indefinite
notions
of
our
own
liberty
greatness
happiness
are
made
to
give
place
to
precise
and
accurate
knowledge
of
the
true
merits
of
our
institutions
the
peculiar
objects
they
are
calculated
to
attain
or
promote
and
the
means
provided
for
that
purpose
the
better
will
every
citizen
be
enabled
to
discharge
his
great
political
duty
of
guarding
those
means
against
the
approach
of
corruption
and
of
sustaining
them
against
the
violence
of
party
commotions
no
foreigner
has
ever
exhibited
such
a
deep
clear
and
correct
insight
of
the
machinery
of
our
complicated
systems
of
federal
and
state
governments
the
most
intelligent
europeans
are
confounded
with
our
in
and
their
constant
wonder
is
that
these
systems
are
not
continually
jostling
each
other
de
tocqueville
has
clearly
perceived
and
traced
correctly
and
distinctly
the
orbits
in
which
they
move
and
has
described
or
rather
defined
our
federal
government
with
an
accurate
precision
unsurpassed
even
by
an
american
pen
there
is
no
citizen
of
this
country
who
will
not
derive
instruction
from
our
author
account
of
our
national
government
or
at
least
who
will
not
find
his
own
ideas
systematised
and
rendered
more
fixed
and
precise
by
the
perusal
of
that
account
among
other
subjects
discussed
by
the
author
that
of
the
of
the
institution
of
trial
by
jury
is
one
of
the
most
curious
and
interesting
he
has
certainly
presented
it
in
a
light
entirely
new
and
as
important
as
it

that

his

conclusion
appendix
introduction
among
the
novel
objects
that
attracted
my
attention
during
my
stay
in
the
united
states
nothing
struck
me
more
forcibly
than
the
general
equality
of
conditions
i
readily
discovered
the
prodigious
influence
which
this
primary
fact
exercises
on
the
whole
course
of
society
by
giving
a
certain
direction
to
public
opinion
and
a
certain
tenor
to
the
laws
by
imparting
new
maxims
to
the
governing
powers
and
peculiar
habits
to
the
governed
i
speedily
perceived
that
the
influence
of
this
fact
extends
far
beyond
the
political
character
and
the
laws
of
the
country
and
that
it
has
no
less
empire
over
civil
society
than
over
the
government
it
creates
opinions
engenders
sentiments
the
ordinary
practices
of
life
and
modifies
whatever
it
does
not
produce
the
more
i
advanced
in
the
study
of
american
society
the
more
i
perceived
that
the
equality
of
conditions
is
the
fundamental
fact
from
which
all
others
seem
to
be
derived
and
the
central
point
at
which
all
my
observations
constantly
terminated
i
then
turned
my
thoughts
to
our
own
hemisphere
where
i
imagined
that
i
discerned
something
analogous
to
the
spectacle
which
the
new
world
presented
to
me
i
observed
that
the
equality
of
conditions
is
daily
advancing
towards
those
extreme
limits
which
it
seems
to
have
reached
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
democracy
which
governs
the
american
communities
appears
to
be
rapidly
rising
into
power
in
europe
i
hence
conceived
the
idea
of
the
book
which
is
now
before
the
reader
it
is
evident
to
all
alike
that
a
great
democratic
revolution
is
going
on
among
us
but
there
are
two
opinions
as
to
its
nature
and
consequences
to
some
it
appears
to
be
a
novel
accident
which
as
such
may
still
be
checked
to
others
it
seems
irresistible
because
it
is
the
most
uniform
the
most
ancient
and
the
most
permanent
tendency
which
is
to
be
found
in
history
let
us
recollect
the
situation
of
france
seven
hundred
years
ago
when
the
territory
was
divided
among
a
small
number
of
families
who
were
the
owners
of
the
soil
and
the
rulers
of
the
inhabitants
the
right
of
governing
descended
with
the
family
inheritance
from
generation
to
generation
force
was
the
only
means
by
which
man
could
act
on
man
and
landed
property
was
the
sole
source
of
power
soon
however
the
political
power
of
the
clergy
was
founded
and
began
to
exert
itself
the
clergy
opened
its
ranks
to
all
classes
to
the
poor
and
the
rich
the
villain
and
the
lord
equality
penetrated
into
the
government
through
the
church
and
the
being
who
as
a
serf
must
have
vegetated
in
perpetual
bondage
took
his
place
as
a
priest
in
the
midst
of
nobles
and
not
unfrequently
above
the
heads
of
kings
the
different
relations
of
men
became
more
complicated
and
more
numerous
as
society
gradually
became
more
stable
and
more
civilized
thence
the
want
of
civil
laws
was
felt
and
the
order
of
legal
functionaries
soon
rose
from
the
obscurity
of
the
tribunals
and
their
dusty
chambers
to
appear
at
the
court
of
the
monarch
by
the
side
of
the
feudal
barons
in
their
ermine
and
their
mail
while
the
kings
were
ruining
themselves
by
their
great
enterprises
and
the
nobles
exhausting
their
resources
by
private
wars
the
lower
orders
were
enriching
themselves
by
commerce
the
influence
of
money
began
to
be
perceptible
in
state
affairs
the
transactions
of
business
opened
a
new
road
to
power
and
the
financier
rose
to
a
station
of
political
influence
in
which
he
was
at
once
flattered
and
despised
gradually
the
spread
of
mental
acquirements
and
the
increasing
taste
for
literature
and
art
opened
chances
of
success
to
talent
science
became
the
means
of
government
intelligence
led
to
social
power
and
the
man
of
letters
took
a
part
in
the
affairs
of
the
state
the
value
attached
to
the
privileges
of
birth
decreased
in
the
exact
proportion
in
which
new
paths
were
struck
out
to
advancement
in
the
eleventh
century
nobility
was
beyond
all
price
in
the
thirteenth
it
might
be
purchased
it
was
conferred
for
the
first
time
in
and
equality
was
thus
introduced
into
the
government
by
the
aristocracy
itself
in
the
course
of
these
seven
hundred
years
it
sometimes
happened
that
in
order
to
resist
the
authority
of
the
crown
or
to
diminish
the
power
of
their
rivals
the
nobles
granted
a
certain
share
of
political
rights
to
the
people
or
more
frequently
the
king
permitted
the
lower
orders
to
enjoy
a
degree
of
power
with
the
intention
of
repressing
the
aristocracy
in
france
the
kings
have
always
been
the
most
active
and
the
most
constant
of
levellers
when
they
were
strong
and
ambitious
they
spared
no
pains
to
raise
the
people
to
the
level
of
the
nobles
when
they
were
temperate
or
weak
they
allowed
the
people
to
rise
above
themselves
some
assisted
the
democracy
by
their
talents
others
by
their
vices
louis
xi
and
louis
xiv
reduced
every
rank
beneath
the
throne
to
the
same
subjection
louis
xv
descended
himself
and
all
his
court
into
the
dust
as
soon
as
land
was
held
on
any
other
than
a
feudal
tenure
and
personal
property
began
in
its
turn
to
confer
influence
and
power
every
improvement
which
was
introduced
in
commerce
or
manufacture
was
a
fresh
element
of
the
equality
of
conditions
henceforward
every
new
discovery
every
new
want
which
it
engendered
and
every
new
desire
which
craved
satisfaction
was
a
step
toward
the
universal
level
the
taste
for
luxury
the
love
of
war
the
sway
of
fashion
the
most
superficial
as
well
as
the
deepest
passions
of
the
human
heart
to
enrich
the
poor
and
to
impoverish
the
rich
from
the
time
when
the
exercise
of
the
intellect
became
the
source
of
strength
and
of
wealth
it
is
impossible
not
to
consider
every
addition
to
science
every
fresh
truth
and
every
new
idea
as
a
germe
of
power
placed
within
the
reach
of
the
people
poetry
eloquence
and
memory
the
grace
of
wit
the
glow
of
imagination
the
depth
of
thought
and
all
the
gifts
which
are
bestowed
by
providence
with
an
equal
hand
turned
to
the
advantage
of
the
democracy
and
even
when
they
were
in
the
possession
of
its
adversaries
they
still
served
its
cause
by
throwing
into
relief
the
natural
greatness
of
man
its
conquests
spread
therefore
with
those
of
civilisation
and
knowledge
and
literature
became
an
arsenal
where
the
poorest
and
weakest
could
always
find
weapons
to
their
hand
in
perusing
the
pages
of
our
history
we
shall
scarcely
meet
with
a
single
great
event
in
the
lapse
of
seven
hundred
years
which
has
not
turned
to
the
advantage
of
equality
the
crusades
and
the
wars
of
the
english
decimated
the
nobles
and
divided
their
possessions
the
erection
of
communes
introduced
an
element
of
democratic
liberty
into
the
bosom
of
feudal
monarchy
the
invention
of
firearms
equalized
the
villain
and
the
noble
on
the
field
of
battle
printing
opened
the
same
resources
to
the
minds
of
all
classes
the
post
was
organized
so
as
to
bring
the
same
information
to
the
door
of
the
poor
man
cottage
and
to
the
gate
of
the
palace
and
protestantism
proclaimed
that
all
men
are
alike
able
to
find
the
road
to
heaven
the
discovery
of
america
offered
a
thousand
new
paths
to
fortune
and
placed
riches
and
power
within
the
reach
of
the
adventurous
and
the
obscure
if
we
examine
what
has
happened
in
france
at
intervals
of
fifty
years
beginning
with
the
eleventh
century
we
shall
invariably
perceive
that
a
twofold
revolution
has
taken
place
in
the
state
of
society
the
noble
has
gone
down
on
the
social
ladder
and
the
has
gone
up
the
one
descends
as
the
other
rises
every
brings
them
nearer
to
each
other
and
they
will
very
shortly
meet
nor
is
this
phenomenon
at
all
peculiar
to
france
whithersoever
we
turn
our
eyes
we
shall
discover
the
same
continual
revolution
throughout
the
whole
of
christendom
the
various
occurrences
of
national
existence
have
everywhere
turned
to
the
advantage
of
democracy
all
men
have
aided
it
by
their
exertions
those
who
have
intentionally
labored
in
its
cause
and
those
who
have
served
it
unwittingly
those
who
have
fought
for
it
and
those
who
have
declared
themselves
its
opponents
have
all
been
driven
along
in
the
same
track
have
all
labored
to
one
end
some
ignorantly
and
some
unwillingly
all
have
been
blind
instruments
in
the
hands
of
god
the
gradual
development
of
the
equality
of
conditions
is
therefore
a
providential
fact
and
it
possesses
all
the
characteristics
of
a
divine
decree
it
is
universal
it
is
durable
it
constantly
eludes
all
human
interference
and
all
events
as
well
as
all
men
contribute
to
its
progress
would
it
then
be
wise
to
imagine
that
a
social
impulse
which
dates
from
so
far
back
can
be
checked
by
the
efforts
of
a
generation
is
it
credible
that
the
democracy
which
has
annihilated
the
feudal
system
and
vanquished
kings
will
respect
the
citizen
and
the
capitalist
will
it
stop
now
that
it
has
grown
so
strong
and
its
adversaries
so
weak
none
can
say
which
way
we
are
going
for
all
terms
of
comparison
are
wanting
the
equality
of
conditions
is
more
complete
in
the
christian
countries
of
the
present
day
than
it
has
been
at
any
time
or
in
any
part
of
the
world
so
that
the
extent
of
what
already
exists
prevents
us
from
foreseeing
what
may
be
yet
to
come
the
whole
book
which
is
here
offered
to
the
public
has
been
written
under
the
impression
of
a
kind
of
religious
dread
produced
in
the
author
mind
by
the
contemplation
of
so
irresistible
a
revolution
which
has
advanced
for
centuries
in
spite
of
such
amazing
obstacles
and
which
is
still
proceeding
in
the
midst
of
the
ruins
it
has
made
it
is
not
necessary
that
god
himself
should
speak
in
order
to
disclose
to
us
the
unquestionable
signs
of
his
will
we
can
discern
them
in
the
habitual
course
of
nature
and
in
the
invariable
tendency
of
events
i
know
without
a
special
revelation
that
the
planets
move
in
the
orbits
traced
by
the
creator
fingers
if
the
men
of
our
time
were
led
by
attentive
observation
and
by
sincere
reflection
to
acknowledge
that
the
gradual
and
progressive
development
of
social
equality
is
at
once
the
past
and
future
of
their
history
this
solitary
truth
would
confer
the
sacred
character
of
a
divine
decree
upon
the
change
to
attempt
to
check
democracy
would
be
in
that
case
to
resist
the
will
of
god
and
the
nations
would
then
be
constrained
to
make
the
best
of
the
social
lot
awarded
to
them
by
providence
the
christian
nations
of
our
age
seem
to
me
to
present
a
most
alarming
spectacle
the
impulse
which
is
bearing
them
along
is
so
strong
that
it
can
not
be
stopped
but
it
is
not
yet
so
rapid
that
it
can
not
be
guided
their
fate
is
in
their
hands
yet
a
little
while
and
it
may
be
so
no
longer
the
first
duty
which
is
at
this
time
imposed
upon
those
who
direct
our
affairs
is
to
educate
the
democracy
to
warm
its
faith
if
that
be
possible
to
purify
its
morals
to
direct
its
energies
to
substitute
a
knowledge
of
business
for
its
inexperience
and
an
acquaintance
with
its
true
interests
for
its
blind
propensities
to
adapt
its
government
to
time
and
place
and
to
modify
it
in
compliance
with
the
occurrences
and
the
actors
of
the
age
a
new
science
of
politics
is
indispensable
to
a
new
world
this
however
is
what
we
think
of
least
launched
in
the
middle
of
a
rapid
stream
we
obstinately
fix
our
eyes
on
the
ruins
which
may
still
be
descried
upon
the
shore
we
have
left
while
the
current
sweeps
us
along
and
drives
us
backward
toward
the
gulf
in
no
country
in
europe
has
the
great
social
revolution
which
i
have
been
describing
made
such
rapid
progress
as
in
france
but
it
has
always
been
borne
on
by
chance
the
heads
of
the
state
have
never
had
any
forethought
for
its
exigences
and
its
victories
have
been
obtained
without
their
consent
or
without
their
knowledge
the
most
powerful
the
most
intelligent
and
the
most
moral
classes
of
the
nation
have
never
attempted
to
connect
themselves
with
it
in
order
to
guide
it
the
people
have
consequently
been
abandoned
to
its
wild
propensities
and
it
has
grown
up
like
those
outcasts
who
receive
their
education
in
the
public
streets
and
who
are
unacquainted
with
aught
but
the
vices
and
wretchedness
of
society
the
existence
of
a
democracy
was
seemingly
unknown
when
on
a
sudden
it
took
possession
of
the
supreme
power
everything
was
then
submitted
to
its
caprices
it
was
worshipped
as
the
idol
of
strength
until
when
it
was
enfeebled
by
its
own
excesses
the
legislator
conceived
the
rash
project
of
annihilating
its
power
instead
of
instructing
it
and
correcting
its
vices
no
attempt
was
made
to
fit
it
to
govern
but
all
were
bent
on
excluding
it
from
the
government
the
consequence
of
this
has
been
that
the
democratic
revolution
has
been
effected
only
in
the
material
parts
of
society
without
that
concomitant
change
in
laws
ideas
customs
and
manners
which
was
necessary
to
render
such
a
revolution
beneficial
we
have
gotten
a
democracy
but
without
the
conditions
which
lessen
its
vices
and
render
its
natural
advantages
more
prominent
and
although
we
already
perceive
the
evils
it
brings
we
are
ignorant
of
the
benefits
it
may
confer
while
the
power
of
the
crown
supported
by
the
aristocracy
peaceably
governed
the
nations
of
europe
society
possessed
in
the
midst
of
its
wretchedness
several
different
advantages
which
can
now
scarcely
be
appreciated
or
conceived
the
power
of
a
part
of
his
subjects
was
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
tyranny
of
the
prince
and
the
monarch
who
felt
the
almost
divine
character
which
he
enjoyed
in
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
derived
a
motive
for
the
just
use
of
his
power
from
the
respect
which
he
inspired
high
as
they
were
placed
above
the
people
the
nobles
could
not
but
take
that
calm
and
benevolent
interest
in
its
fate
which
the
shepherd
feels
toward
his
flock
and
without
acknowledging
the
poor
as
their
equals
they
watched
over
the
destiny
of
those
whose
welfare
providence
had
intrusted
to
their
care
the
people
never
having
conceived
the
idea
of
a
social
condition
different
from
its
own
and
entertaining
no
expectation
of
ever
ranking
with
its
chiefs
received
benefits
from
them
without
discussing
their
rights
it
grew
attached
to
them
when
they
were
clement
and
just
but
it
submitted
without
resistance
or
servility
to
their
exactions
as
to
the
inevitable
visitations
of
the
arm
of
god
custom
and
the
manners
of
the
time
had
moreover
created
a
species
of
law
in
the
midst
of
violence
and
established
certain
limits
to
oppression
as
the
noble
never
suspected
that
any
one
would
attempt
to
deprive
him
of
the
privileges
which
he
believed
to
be
legitimate
and
as
the
serf
looked
upon
his
own
inferiority
as
a
consequence
of
the
immutable
order
of
nature
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
a
mutual
exchange
of
took
place
between
two
classes
so
differently
gifted
by
fate
inequality
and
wretchedness
were
then
to
be
found
in
society
but
the
souls
of
neither
rank
of
men
were
degraded
men
are
not
corrupted
by
the
exercise
of
power
or
debased
by
the
habit
of
obedience
but
by
the
exercise
of
power
which
they
believe
to
be
illegal
and
by
obedience
to
a
rule
which
they
consider
to
be
usurped
and
oppressive
on
one
side
were
wealth
strength
and
leisure
accompanied
by
the
refinement
of
luxury
the
elegance
of
taste
the
pleasures
of
wit
and
the
religion
of
art
on
the
other
were
labor
and
a
rude
ignorance
but
in
the
midst
of
this
coarse
and
ignorant
multitude
it
was
not
uncommon
to
meet
with
energetic
passions
generous
sentiments
profound
religious
convictions
and
independent
virtues
the
body
of
a
state
thus
organized
might
boast
of
its
stability
its
power
and
above
all
of
its
glory
but
the
scene
is
now
changed
and
gradually
the
two
ranks
mingle
the
divisions
which
once
severed
mankind
are
lowered
property
is
divided
power
is
held
in
common
the
light
of
intelligence
spreads
and
the
capacities
of
all
classes
are
equally
cultivated
the
state
becomes
democratic
and
the
empire
of
democracy
is
slowly
and
peaceably
introduced
into
the
institutions
and
manners
of
the
nation
i
can
conceive
a
society
in
which
all
men
would
profess
an
equal
attachment
and
respect
for
the
laws
of
which
they
are
the
common
authors
in
which
the
authority
of
the
state
would
be
respected
as
necessary
though
not
as
divine
and
the
loyalty
of
the
subject
to
the
chief
magistrate
would
not
be
a
passion
but
a
quiet
and
rational
persuasion
every
individual
being
in
the
possession
of
rights
which
he
is
sure
to
retain
a
kind
of
manly
reliance
and
reciprocal
courtesy
would
arise
between
all
classes
alike
removed
from
pride
and
meanness
the
people
well
acquainted
with
its
true
interests
would
allow
that
in
order
to
profit
by
the
advantages
of
society
it
is
necessary
to
satisfy
its
demands
in
this
state
of
things
the
voluntary
association
of
the
citizens
might
supply
the
individual
exertions
of
the
nobles
and
the
community
would
be
alike
protected
from
anarchy
and
from
oppression
i
admit
that
in
a
democratic
state
thus
constituted
society
will
not
be
stationary
but
the
impulses
of
the
social
body
may
be
regulated
and
directed
forward
if
there
be
less
splendor
than
in
the
halls
of
an
aristocracy
the
contrast
of
misery
will
be
less
frequent
also
the
pleasures
of
enjoyment
may
be
less
excessive
but
those
of
comfort
will
be
more
general
the
sciences
may
be
less
perfectly
cultivated
but
ignorance
will
be
less
common
the
impetuosity
of
the
feelings
will
be
repressed
and
the
habits
of
the
nation
softened
there
will
be
more
vices
and
fewer
crimes
in
the
absence
of
enthusiasm
and
of
an
ardent
faith
great
sacrifices
may
be
obtained
from
the
members
of
a
commonwealth
by
an
appeal
to
their
understandings
and
their
experience
each
individual
will
feel
the
same
necessity
for
uniting
with
his
to
protect
his
own
weakness
and
as
he
knows
that
if
they
are
to
assist
he
must
he
will
readily
perceive
that
his
personal
interest
is
identified
with
the
interest
of
the
community
the
nation
taken
as
a
whole
will
be
less
brilliant
less
glorious
and
perhaps
less
strong
but
the
majority
of
the
citizens
will
enjoy
a
greater
degree
of
prosperity
and
the
people
will
remain
quiet
not
because
it
despairs
of
melioration
but
because
it
is
conscious
of
the
advantages
of
its
condition
if
all
the
consequences
of
this
state
of
things
were
not
good
or
useful
society
would
at
least
have
appropriated
all
such
as
were
useful
and
good
and
having
once
and
for
ever
renounced
the
social
advantages
of
aristocracy
mankind
would
enter
into
possession
of
all
the
benefits
which
democracy
can
afford
but
here
it
may
be
asked
what
we
have
adopted
in
the
place
of
those
institutions
those
ideas
and
those
customs
of
our
forefathers
which
we
have
abandoned
the
spell
of
royalty
is
broken
but
it
has
not
been
succeeded
by
the
majesty
of
the
laws
the
people
have
learned
to
despise
all
authority
but
fear
now
extorts
a
larger
tribute
of
obedience
than
that
which
was
formerly
paid
by
reverence
and
by
love
i
perceive
that
we
have
destroyed
those
independent
beings
which
were
able
to
cope
with
tyranny
but
it
is
the
government
that
has
inherited
the
privileges
of
which
families
corporations
and
individuals
have
been
deprived
the
weakness
of
the
whole
community
has
therefore
succeeded
to
that
influence
of
a
small
body
of
citizens
which
if
it
was
sometimes
oppressive
was
often
conservative
the
division
of
property
has
lessened
the
distance
which
separated
the
rich
from
the
poor
but
it
would
seem
that
the
nearer
they
draw
to
each
other
the
greater
is
their
mutual
hatred
and
the
more
vehement
the
envy
and
the
dread
with
which
they
resist
each
other
claims
to
power
the
notion
of
right
is
alike
insensible
to
both
classes
and
force
affords
to
both
the
only
argument
for
the
present
and
the
only
guarantee
for
the
future
the
poor
man
retains
the
prejudices
of
his
forefathers
without
their
faith
and
their
ignorance
without
their
virtues
he
has
adopted
the
doctrine
of
as
the
rule
of
his
actions
without
understanding
the
science
which
controls
it
and
his
egotism
is
no
less
blind
than
his
devotedness
was
formerly
if
society
is
tranquil
it
is
not
because
it
relies
upon
its
strength
and
its
but
because
it
knows
its
weakness
and
its
infirmities
a
single
effort
may
cost
it
its
life
everybody
feels
the
evil
but
no
one
has
courage
or
energy
enough
to
seek
the
cure
the
desires
the
regret
the
sorrows
and
the
joys
of
the
time
produce
nothing
that
is
visible
or
permanent
like
the
passions
of
old
men
which
terminate
in
impotence
we
have
then
abandoned
whatever
advantages
the
old
state
of
things
afforded
without
receiving
any
compensation
from
our
present
condition
having
destroyed
an
aristocracy
we
seem
inclined
to
survey
its
ruins
with
complacency
and
to
fix
our
abode
in
the
midst
of
them
the
phenomena
which
the
intellectual
world
presents
are
not
less
deplorable
the
democracy
of
france
checked
in
its
course
or
abandoned
to
its
lawless
passions
has
overthrown
whatever
crossed
its
path
and
has
shaken
all
that
it
has
not
destroyed
its
control
over
society
has
not
been
gradually
introduced
or
peaceably
established
but
it
has
constantly
advanced
in
the
midst
of
disorder
and
the
agitation
of
a
conflict
in
the
heat
of
the
struggle
each
partisan
is
hurried
beyond
the
limits
of
his
opinions
by
the
opinions
and
the
excesses
of
his
opponents
until
he
loses
sight
of
the
end
of
his
exertions
and
holds
a
language
which
disguises
his
real
sentiments
or
secret
instincts
hence
arises
the
strange
confusion
which
we
are
beholding
i
can
not
recall
to
my
mind
a
passage
in
history
more
worthy
of
sorrow
and
of
pity
than
the
scenes
which
are
happening
under
our
eyes
it
is
as
if
the
natural
bond
which
unites
the
opinions
of
man
to
his
tastes
and
his
actions
to
his
principles
was
now
broken
the
sympathy
which
has
always
been
acknowledged
between
the
feelings
and
the
ideas
of
mankind
appears
to
be
dissolved
and
all
the
laws
of
moral
analogy
to
be
abolished
zealous
christians
may
be
found
among
us
whose
minds
are
nurtured
in
the
love
and
knowledge
of
a
future
life
and
who
readily
espouse
the
cause
of
human
liberty
as
the
source
of
all
moral
greatness
christianity
which
has
declared
that
all
men
are
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
will
not
refuse
to
acknowledge
that
all
citizens
are
equal
in
the
eye
of
the
law
but
by
a
singular
concourse
of
events
religion
is
entangled
in
those
institutions
which
democracy
assails
and
it
is
not
unfrequently
brought
to
reject
the
equality
it
loves
and
to
curse
that
cause
of
liberty
as
a
foe
which
it
might
hallow
by
its
alliance
by
the
side
of
these
religious
men
i
discern
others
whose
looks
are
turned
to
the
earth
more
than
to
heaven
they
are
the
partisans
of
liberty
not
only
as
the
source
of
the
noblest
virtues
but
more
especially
as
the
root
of
all
solid
advantages
and
they
sincerely
desire
to
extend
its
sway
and
to
impart
its
blessings
to
mankind
it
is
natural
that
they
should
hasten
to
invoke
the
assistance
of
religion
for
they
must
know
that
liberty
can
not
be
established
without
morality
nor
morality
without
faith
but
they
have
seen
religion
in
the
ranks
of
their
adversaries
and
they
inquire
no
farther
some
of
them
attack
it
openly
and
the
remainder
are
afraid
to
defend
it
in
former
ages
slavery
has
been
advocated
by
the
venal
and
while
the
independent
and
the
were
struggling
without
hope
to
save
the
liberties
of
mankind
but
men
of
high
and
generous
characters
are
now
to
be
met
with
whose
opinions
are
at
variance
with
their
inclinations
and
who
praise
that
servility
which
they
have
themselves
never
known
others
on
the
contrary
speak
in
the
name
of
liberty
as
if
they
were
able
to
feel
its
sanctity
and
its
majesty
and
loudly
claim
for
humanity
those
rights
which
they
have
always
disowned
there
are
virtuous
and
peaceful
individuals
whose
pure
morality
quiet
habits
affluence
and
talents
fit
them
to
be
the
leaders
of
the
surrounding
population
their
love
of
their
country
is
sincere
and
they
are
prepared
to
make
the
greatest
sacrifices
to
its
welfare
but
they
confound
the
abuses
of
civilisation
with
its
benefits
and
the
idea
of
evil
is
inseparable
in
their
minds
from
that
of
novelty
not
far
from
this
class
is
another
party
whose
object
is
to
materialise
mankind
to
hit
upon
what
is
expedient
without
heeding
what
is
just
to
acquire
knowledge
without
faith
and
prosperity
apart
from
virtue
assuming
the
title
of
the
champions
of
modern
civilisation
and
placing
themselves
in
a
station
which
they
usurp
with
insolence
and
from
which
they
are
driven
by
their
own
unworthiness
where
are
we
then
the
religionists
are
the
enemies
of
liberty
and
the
friends
of
liberty
attack
religion
the
and
the
noble
advocate
subjection
and
the
meanest
and
most
servile
minds
preach
independence
honest
and
enlightened
citizens
are
opposed
to
all
progress
while
men
without
patriotism
and
without
principles
are
the
apostles
of
civilisation
and
of
intelligence
has
such
been
the
fate
of
the
centuries
which
have
preceded
our
own
and
has
man
always
inhabited
a
world
like
the
present
where
nothing
is
linked
together
where
virtue
is
without
genius
and
genius
without
honor
where
the
love
of
order
is
confounded
with
a
taste
for
oppression
and
the
holy
rites
of
freedom
with
a
contempt
of
law
where
the
light
thrown
by
conscience
on
human
actions
is
dim
and
where
nothing
seems
to
be
any
longer
forbidden
or
allowed
honorable
or
shameful
false
or
true
i
can
not
however
believe
that
the
creator
made
man
to
leave
him
in
an
endless
struggle
with
the
intellectual
miseries
which
surround
us
god
destines
a
calmer
and
a
more
certain
future
to
the
communities
of
europe
i
am
unacquainted
with
his
designs
but
i
shall
not
cease
to
believe
in
them
because
i
can
not
fathom
them
and
i
had
rather
mistrust
my
own
capacity
than
his
justice
there
is
a
country
in
the
world
where
the
great
revolution
which
i
am
speaking
of
seems
nearly
to
have
reached
its
natural
limits
it
has
been
effected
with
ease
and
simplicity
say
rather
that
this
country
has
attained
the
consequences
of
the
democratic
revolution
which
we
are
undergoing
without
having
experienced
the
revolution
itself
the
emigrants
who
fixed
themselves
on
the
shores
of
america
in
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
severed
the
democratic
principle
from
all
the
principles
which
repressed
it
in
the
old
communities
of
europe
and
transplanted
it
unalloyed
to
the
new
world
it
has
there
been
allowed
to
spread
in
perfect
freedom
and
to
put
forth
its
consequences
in
the
laws
by
influencing
the
manners
of
the
country
it
appears
to
me
beyond
a
doubt
that
sooner
or
later
we
shall
arrive
like
the
americans
at
an
almost
complete
equality
of
conditions
but
i
do
not
conclude
from
this
that
we
shall
ever
be
necessarily
led
to
draw
the
same
political
consequences
which
the
americans
have
derived
from
a
similar
social
organization
i
am
far
from
supposing
that
they
have
chosen
the
only
form
of
government
which
a
democracy
may
adopt
but
the
identity
of
the
efficient
cause
of
laws
and
manners
in
the
two
countries
is
sufficient
to
account
for
the
immense
interest
we
have
in
becoming
acquainted
with
its
effects
in
each
of
them
it
is
not
then
merely
to
satisfy
a
legitimate
curiosity
that
i
have
examined
america
my
wish
has
been
to
find
instruction
by
which
we
may
ourselves
profit
whoever
should
imagine
that
i
have
intended
to
write
a
panegyric
would
be
strangely
mistaken
and
on
reading
this
book
he
will
perceive
that
such
was
not
my
design
nor
has
it
been
my
object
to
advocate
any
form
of
government
in
particular
for
i
am
of
opinion
that
absolute
excellence
is
rarely
to
be
found
in
any
legislation
i
have
not
even
affected
to
discuss
whether
the
social
revolution
which
i
believe
to
be
irresistible
is
advantageous
or
prejudicial
to
mankind
i
have
acknowledged
this
revolution
as
a
fact
already
accomplished
or
on
the
eve
of
its
accomplishment
and
i
have
selected
the
nation
from
among
those
which
have
undergone
it
in
which
its
development
has
been
the
most
peaceful
and
the
most
complete
in
order
to
discern
its
natural
consequences
and
if
it
be
possible
to
distinguish
the
means
by
which
it
may
be
rendered
profitable
i
confess
that
in
america
i
saw
more
than
america
i
sought
the
image
of
democracy
itself
with
its
inclinations
its
character
its
prejudices
and
its
passions
in
order
to
learn
what
we
have
to
fear
or
to
hope
from
its
progress
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
i
have
attempted
to
show
the
tendency
given
to
the
laws
by
the
democracy
of
america
which
is
abandoned
almost
without
restraint
to
its
instinctive
propensities
and
to
exhibit
the
course
it
prescribes
to
the
government
and
the
influence
it
exercises
on
affairs
i
have
sought
to
discover
the
evils
and
the
advantages
which
it
produces
i
have
examined
the
precautions
used
by
the
americans
to
direct
it
as
well
as
those
which
they
have
not
adopted
and
i
have
undertaken
to
point
out
the
causes
which
enable
it
to
govern
society
it
was
my
intention
to
depict
in
a
second
part
the
influence
which
the
equality
of
conditions
and
the
rule
of
democracy
exercise
on
the
civil
society
the
habits
the
ideas
and
the
manners
of
the
americans
i
begin
however
to
feel
less
ardor
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
project
since
the
excellent
work
of
my
friend
and
travelling
companion
de
beaumont
has
been
given
to
the
world
i
do
not
know
whether
i
have
succeeded
in
making
known
what
i
saw
in
america
but
i
am
certain
that
such
has
been
my
sincere
desire
and
that
i
have
never
knowingly
moulded
facts
to
ideas
instead
of
ideas
to
facts
whenever
a
point
could
be
established
by
the
aid
of
written
documents
i
have
had
recourse
to
the
original
text
and
to
the
most
authentic
and
approved
works
i
have
cited
my
authorities
in
the
notes
and
any
one
may
refer
to
them
whenever
an
opinion
a
political
custom
or
a
remark
on
the
manners
of
the
country
was
concerned
i
endeavored
to
consult
the
most
enlightened
men
i
met
with
if
the
point
in
question
was
important
or
doubtful
i
was
not
satisfied
with
one
testimony
but
i
formed
my
opinion
on
the
evidence
of
several
witnesses
here
the
reader
must
necessarily
believe
me
upon
my
word
i
could
frequently
have
quoted
names
which
are
either
known
to
him
or
which
deserve
to
be
so
in
proof
of
what
i
advance
but
i
have
carefully
abstained
from
this
practice
a
stranger
frequently
hears
important
truths
at
the
fireside
of
his
host
which
the
latter
would
perhaps
conceal
even
from
the
ear
of
friendship
he
consoles
himself
with
his
guest
for
the
silence
to
which
he
is
restricted
and
the
shortness
of
the
traveller
stay
takes
away
all
fear
of
his
indiscretion
i
carefully
noted
every
conversation
of
this
nature
as
soon
as
it
occurred
but
these
notes
will
never
leave
my
i
had
rather
injure
the
success
of
my
statements
than
add
my
name
to
the
list
of
those
strangers
who
repay
the
generous
hospitality
they
have
received
by
subsequent
chagrin
and
annoyance
i
am
aware
that
notwithstanding
my
care
nothing
will
be
easier
than
to
criticise
this
book
if
any
one
ever
chooses
to
criticise
it
those
readers
who
may
examine
it
closely
will
discover
the
fundamental
idea
which
connects
the
several
parts
together
but
the
diversity
of
the
subjects
i
have
had
to
treat
is
exceedingly
great
and
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
oppose
an
isolated
fact
to
the
body
of
facts
which
i
quote
or
an
isolated
idea
to
the
body
of
ideas
i
put
forth
i
hope
to
be
read
in
the
spirit
which
has
guided
my
labors
and
that
my
book
may
be
judged
by
the
general
impression
it
leaves
as
i
have
formed
my
own
judgment
not
on
any
single
reason
but
upon
the
mass
of
evidence
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
author
who
wishes
to
be
understood
is
obliged
to
push
all
his
ideas
to
their
utmost
theoretical
consequences
and
often
to
the
verge
of
what
is
false
or
impracticable
for
if
it
be
necessary
sometimes
to
quit
the
rules
of
logic
in
active
life
such
is
not
the
case
in
discourse
and
a
man
finds
that
almost
as
many
difficulties
spring
from
inconsistency
of
language
as
usually
arise
from
consistency
of
conduct
i
conclude
by
pointing
out
myself
what
many
readers
will
consider
the
principal
defect
of
the
work
this
book
is
written
to
favor
no
particular
views
and
in
composing
it
i
have
entertained
no
design
of
serving
or
attacking
any
party
i
have
undertaken
not
to
see
differently
but
to
look
farther
than
parties
and
while
they
are
busied
for
the
morrow
i
have
turned
my
thoughts
to
the
future

inclining
toward

the

of
their

their
outward
appearance

of
an
unknown
people
north
america
presents
in
its
external
form
certain
general
features
which
it
is
easy
to
discriminate
at
the
first
glance
a
sort
of
methodical
order
seems
to
have
regulated
the
separation
of
land
and
water
mountains
and
valleys
a
simple
but
grand
arrangement
is
discoverable
amid
the
confusion
of
objects
and
the
prodigious
variety
of
scenes
this
continent
is
divided
almost
equally
into
two
vast
regions
one
of
which
is
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
arctic
pole
and
by
the
two
great
oceans
on
the
east
and
west
it
stretches
toward
the
south
forming
a
triangle
whose
irregular
sides
meet
at
length
below
the
great
lakes
of
canada
the
second
region
begins
where
the
other
terminates
and
includes
all
the
remainder
of
the
continent
the
one
slopes
gently
toward
the
pole
the
other
toward
the
equator
the
territory
comprehended
in
the
first
regions
descends
toward
the
north
with
so
imperceptible
a
slope
that
it
may
almost
be
said
to
form
a
level
plain
within
the
bounds
of
this
immense
tract
of
country
there
are
neither
high
mountains
nor
deep
valleys
streams
meander
through
it
irregularly
great
rivers
mix
their
currents
separate
and
meet
again
disperse
and
form
vast
marshes
losing
all
trace
of
their
channels
in
the
labyrinth
of
waters
they
have
themselves
created
and
thus
at
length
after
innumerable
windings
fall
into
the
polar
seas
the
great
lakes
which
bound
this
first
region
are
not
walled
in
like
most
of
those
in
the
old
world
between
hills
and
rocks
their
banks
are
flat
and
rise
but
a
few
feet
above
the
level
of
their
waters
each
of
them
thus
forming
a
vast
bowl
filled
to
the
brim
the
slightest
change
in
the
structure
of
the
globe
would
cause
their
waters
to
rush
either
toward
the
pole
or
to
the
tropical
sea
the
second
region
is
more
varied
on
its
surface
and
better
suited
for
the
habitation
of
man
two
long
chains
of
mountains
divide
it
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
the
allegany
ridge
takes
the
form
of
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
ocean
the
other
is
parallel
with
the
pacific
the
space
which
lies
between
these
two
chains
of
mountains
contains
square
miles
its
surface
is
therefore
about
six
times
as
great
as
that
of
france
this
vast
territory
however
forms
a
single
valley
one
side
of
which
descends
gradually
from
the
rounded
summits
of
the
alleganies
while
the
other
rises
in
an
uninterrupted
course
toward
the
tops
of
the
rocky
mountains
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
flows
an
immense
river
into
which
the
various
streams
issuing
from
the
mountains
fall
from
all
parts
in
memory
of
their
native
land
the
french
formerly
called
this
the
river
louis
the
indians
in
their
pompous
language
have
named
it
the
father
of
waters
or
the
mississippi
the
mississippi
takes
its
source
above
the
limit
of
the
two
great
regions
of
which
i
have
spoken
not
far
from
the
highest
point
of
the
where
they
unite
near
the
same
spot
rises
another
river
which
empties
itself
into
the
polar
seas
the
course
of
the
mississippi
is
at
first
devious
it
winds
several
times
toward
the
north
whence
it
rose
and
at
length
after
having
been
delayed
in
lakes
and
marshes
it
flows
slowly
onward
to
the
south
sometimes
quietly
gliding
along
the
argillaceous
bed
which
nature
has
assigned
to
it
sometimes
swollen
by
storms
the
mississippi
waters
miles
in
its
course
at
the
distance
of
miles
from
its
mouth
this
river
attains
an
average
depth
of
fifteen
feet
and
it
is
navigated
by
vessels
of
tons
burden
for
a
course
of
nearly
miles
large
navigable
rivers
contribute
to
swell
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
among
others
the
missouri
which
traverses
a
space
of
miles
the
arkansas
of

the

river
miles

whose
course
is
from
to
miles
in
length
the
illinois
the
peter
the
francis
and
the
moingona
besides
a
countless
number
of
rivulets
which
unite
from
all
parts
their
tributary
streams
the
valley
which
is
watered
by
the
mississippi
seems
formed
to
be
the
bed
of
this
mighty
river
which
like
a
god
of
antiquity
dispenses
both
good
and
evil
in
its
course
on
the
shores
of
the
stream
nature
displays
an
inexhaustible
fertility
in
proportion
as
you
recede
from
its
banks
the
powers
of
vegetation
languish
the
soil
becomes
poor
and
the
plants
that
survive
have
a
sickly
growth
nowhere
have
the
great
convulsions
of
the
globe
left
more
evident
traces
than
in
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
the
whole
aspect
of
the
country
shows
the
powerful
effects
of
water
both
by
its
fertility
and
by
its
barrenness
the
waters
of
the
primeval
ocean
accumulated
enormous
beds
of
vegetable
mould
in
the
valley
which
they
levelled
as
they
retired
upon
the
right
shore
of
the
river
are
seen
immense
plains
as
smooth
as
if
the
husbandman
had
passed
over
them
with
his
roller
as
you
approach
the
mountains
the
soil
becomes
more
and
more
unequal
and
sterile
the
ground
is
as
it
were
pierced
in
a
thousand
places
by
primitive
rocks
which
appear
like
the
bones
of
a
skeleton
whose
flesh
is
partly
consumed
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
covered
with
a
granitic
sand
and
huge
irregular
masses
of
stone
among
which
a
few
plants
force
their
growth
and
give
the
appearance
of
a
green
field
covered
with
the
ruins
of
a
vast
edifice
these
stones
and
this
sand
discover
on
examination
a
perfect
analogy
with
those
which
compose
the
arid
and
broken
summits
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
flood
of
waters
which
washed
the
soil
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
afterward
carried
away
portions
of
the
rocks
themselves
and
these
dashed
and
bruised
against
the
neighboring
cliffs
were
left
scattered
like
wrecks
at
their
feet
the
valley
of

mississippi
is
upon
the
whole
the
most
magnificent
prepared
by
god
for
man
abode
and
yet
it
may
be
said
that
at
present
it
is
but
a
mighty
desert
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
alleganies
between
the
base
of
these
mountains
and
the
atlantic
ocean
lies
a
long
ridge
of
rocks
and
sand
which
the
sea
appears
to
have
left
behind
as
it
retired
the
mean
breadth
of
this
territory
does
not
exceed
one
hundred
miles
but
it
is
about
nine
hundred
miles
in
length
this
part
of
the
american
continent
has
a
soil
which
offers
every
obstacle
to
the
husbandman
and
its
vegetation
is
scanty
and
unvaried
upon
this
inhospitable
coast
the
first
united
efforts
of
human
industry
were
made
this
tongue
of
arid
land
was
the
cradle
of
those
english
colonies
which
were
destined
one
day
to
become
the
united
states
of
america
the
centre
of
power
still
remains
there
while
in
the
backward
states
the
true
elements
of
the
great
people
to
whom
the
future
control
of
the
continent
belongs
are
secretly
springing
up
when
the
europeans
first
landed
on
the
shores
of
the
antilles
and
afterwards
on
the
coast
of
south
america
they
thought
themselves
transported
into
those
fabulous
regions
of
which
poets
had
sung
the
sea
sparkled
with
phosphoric
light
and
the
extraordinary
transparency
of
its
waters
discovered
to
the
view
of
the
navigator
all
that
had
hitherto
been
hidden
in
the
deep
abyss
here
and
there
appeared
little
islands
perfumed
with
odoriferous
plants
and
resembling
baskets
of
flowers
floating
on
the
tranquil
surface
of
the
ocean
every
object
which
met
the
sight
in
this
enchanting
region
seemed
prepared
to
satisfy
the
wants
or
contribute
to
the
pleasures
of
man
almost
all
the
trees
were
loaded
with
nourishing
fruits
and
those
which
were
useless
as
food
delighted
the
eye
by
the
brilliancy
and
variety
of
their
colors
in
groves
of
fragrant
wild
figs
flowering
myrtles
acacias
and
oleanders
which
were
hung
with
festoons
of
various
covered
with
flowers
a
multitude
of
birds
unknown
in
europe
displayed
their
bright
plumage
glittering
with
purple
and
azure
and
mingled
their
warbling
in
the
harmony
of
a
world
teeming
with
life
and
motion
underneath
this
brilliant
exterior
death
was
concealed
the
air
of
these
climates
had
so
enervating
an
influence
that
man
completely
absorbed
by
the
present
enjoyment
was
rendered
regardless
of
the
future
north
america
appeared
under
a
very
different
aspect
there
everything
was
grave
serious
and
solemn
it
seemed
created
to
be
the
domain
of
intelligence
as
the
south
was
that
of
sensual
delight
a
turbulent
and
foggy
ocean
washed
its
shores
it
was
girded
round
by
a
belt
of
granite
rocks
or
by
wide
plains
of
sand
the
foliage
of
its
woods
was
dark
and
gloomy
for
they
were
composed
of
firs
larches
evergreen
oaks
wild
and
laurels
beyond
this
outer
belt
lay
the
thick
shades
of
the
central
forests
where
the
largest
trees
which
are
produced
in
the
two
hemispheres
grow
side
by
side
the
plane
the
catalpa
the
and
the
virginian
poplar
mingled
their
branches
with
those
of
the
oak
the
beech
and
the
lime
in
these
as
in
the
forests
of
the
old
world
destruction
was
perpetually
going
on
the
ruins
of
vegetation
were
heaped
upon
each
other
but
there
was
no
laboring
hand
to
remove
them
and
their
decay
was
not
rapid
enough
to
make
room
for
the
continual
work
of
reproduction
grasses
and
other
herbs
forced
their
way
through
the
moss
of
dying
trees
they
crept
along
their
bending
trunks
found
nourishment
in
their
dusty
cavities
and
a
passage
beneath
the
lifeless
bark
thus
decay
gave
its
assistance
to
life
and
their
respective
productions
were
mingled
together
the
depths
of
these
forests
were
gloomy
and
obscure
and
a
thousand
rivulets
undirected
in
their
course
by
human
industry
preserved
in
them
a
constant
moisture
it
was
rare
to
meet
with
flowers
wild
fruits
or
birds
beneath
their
shades
the
fall
of
a
tree
overthrown
by
age
the
rushing
torrent
of
a
cataract
the
lowing
of
the
buffalo
and
the
howling
of
the
wind
were
the
only
sounds
which
broke
the
silence
of
nature
to
the
east
of
the
great
river
the
woods
almost
disappeared
in
their
stead
were
seen
prairies
of
immense
extent
whether
nature
in
her
infinite
variety
had
denied
the
germes
of
trees
to
these
fertile
plains
or
whether
they
had
once
been
covered
with
forests
subsequently
destroyed
by
the
hand
of
man
is
a
question
which
neither
tradition
nor
scientific
research
has
been
able
to
resolve
these
immense
deserts
were
not
however
devoid
of
human
inhabitants
some
wandering
tribes
had
been
for
ages
scattered
among
the
forest
shades
or
the
green
pastures
of
the
prairie
from
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
to
the
delta
of
the
mississippi
and
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
ocean
these
savages
possessed
certain
points
of
resemblance
which
bore
witness
of
their
common
origin
but
at
the
same
time
they
differed
from
all
other
known
races
of
men
they
were
neither
white
like
the
europeans
nor
yellow
like
most
of
the
asiatics
nor
black
like
the
negroes
their
skin
was
reddish
brown
their
hair
long
and
shining
their
lips
thin
and
their
very
prominent
the
languages
spoken
by
the
north
american
tribes
were
various
as
far
as
regarded
their
words
but
they
were
subject
to
the
same
grammatical
rules
those
rules
differed
in
several
points
from
such
as
had
been
observed
to
govern
the
origin
of
language
the
idiom
of
the
americans
seemed
to
be
the
product
of
new
combinations
and
bespoke
an
effort
of
the
understanding
of
which
the
indians
of
our
days
would
be
incapable
the
social
state
of
these
tribes
differed
also
in
many
respects
from
all
that
was
seen
in
the
old
world
they
seemed
to
have
multiplied
freely
in
the
midst
of
their
deserts
without
coming
in
contact
with
other
races
more
civilized
than
their
own
accordingly
they
exhibited
none
of
those
indistinct
incoherent
notions
of
right
and
wrong
none
of
that
deep
corruption
of
manners
that
is
usually
joined
with
ignorance
and
rudeness
among
nations
which
after
advancing
to
civilisation
have
relapsed
into
a
state
of
barbarism
the
indian
was
indebted
to
no
one
but
himself
his
virtues
his
vices
and
his
prejudices
were
his
own
work
he
had
grown
up
in
the
wild
independence
of
his
nature
if
in
polished
countries
the
lowest
of
the
people
are
rude
and
uncivil
it
is
not
merely
because
they
are
poor
and
ignorant
but
that
being
so
they
are
in
daily
contact
with
rich
and
enlightened
men
the
sight
of
their
own
hard
lot
and
of
their
weakness
which
are
daily
contrasted
with
the
happiness
and
power
of
some
of
their
fellow
creatures
excites
in
their
hearts
at
the
same
time
the
sentiments
of
anger
and
of
fear
the
consciousness
of
their
inferiority
and
of
their
dependence
irritates
while
it
humiliates
them
this
state
of
mind
displays
itself
in
their
manners
and
language
they
are
at
once
insolent
and
servile
the
truth
of
this
is
easily
proved
by
observation
the
people
are
more
rude
in
aristocratic
countries
than
elsewhere
in
opulent
cities
than
in
rural
districts
in
those
places
where
the
rich
and
powerful
are
assembled
together
the
weak
and
the
indigent
feel
themselves
oppressed
by
their
inferior
condition
unable
to
perceive
a
single
chance
of
regaining
their
equality
they
give
up
to
despair
and
allow
themselves
to
fall
below
the
dignity
of
human
nature
this
unfortunate
effect
of
the
disparity
of
conditions
is
not
observable
in
savage
life
the
indians
although
they
are
ignorant
and
poor
are
equal
and
free
at
the
period
when
europeans
first
came
among
them
the
natives
of
north
america
were
ignorant
of
the
value
of
riches
and
indifferent
to
the
enjoyments
which
civilized
man
procures
to
himself
by
their
means
nevertheless
there
was
nothing
coarse
in
their
demeanor
they
practised
an
habitual
reserve
and
a
kind
of
aristocratic
politeness
mild
and
hospitable
when
at
peace
though
merciless
in
war
beyond
any
known
degree
of
human
ferocity
the
indian
would
expose
himself
to
die
of
hunger
in
order
to
succor
the
stranger
who
asked
admittance
by
night
at
the
door
of
his
hut
yet
he
could
tear
in
pieces
with
his
hands
the
still
quivering
limbs
of
his
prisoner
the
famous
republics
of
antiquity
never
gave
examples
of
more
unshaken
courage
more
haughty
spirits
or
more
intractable
love
of
independence
than
were
hidden
in
former
times
among
the
wild
forests
of
the
new
world
the
europeans
produced
no
great
impression
when
they
landed
upon
the
shores
of
north
america
their
presence
engendered
neither
envy
nor
fear
what
influence
could
they
possess
over
such
men
as
we
have
described
the
indian
could
live
without
wants
suffer
without
complaint
and
pour
out
his
at
the
stake
like
all
the
other
members
of
the
great
human
family
these
savages
believed
in
the
existence
of
a
better
world
and
adored
under
different
names
god
the
creator
of
the
universe
their
notions
on
the
great
intellectual
truths
were
in
general
simple
and
philosophical
although
we
have
here
traced
the
character
of
a
primitive
people
yet
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
another
people
more
civilized
and
more
advanced
in
all
respects
had
preceded
it
in
the
same
regions
an
obscure
tradition
which
prevailed
among
the
indians
to
the
north
of
the
atlantic
informs
us
that
these
very
tribes
formerly
dwelt
on
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
along
the
banks
of
the
ohio
and
throughout
the
central
valley
there
are
frequently
found
at
this
day
raised
by
the
hands
of
men
on
exploring
these
heaps
of
earth
to
their
centre
it
is
usual
to
meet
with
human
bones
strange
instruments
arms
and
utensils
of
all
kinds
made
of
a
metal
or
destined
for
purposes
unknown
to
the
present
race
the
indians
of
our
time
are
unable
to
give
any
information
relative
to
the
history
of
this
unknown
people
neither
did
those
who
lived
three
hundred
years
ago
when
america
was
first
discovered
leave
any
accounts
from
which
even
an
hypothesis
could
be
formed
tradition
that
perishable
yet
monument
of
the
pristine
world
throws
no
light
upon
the
subject
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
however
that
in
this
part
of
the
globe
thousands
of
our
had
lived
when
they
came
hither
what
was
their
origin
their
destiny
their
history
and
how
they
perished
no
one
can
tell
how
strange
does
it
appear
that
nations
have
existed
and
afterward
so
completely
disappeared
from
the
earth
that
the
remembrance
of
their
very
name
is
effaced
their
languages
are
lost
their
glory
is
vanished
like
a
sound
without
an
echo
but
perhaps
there
is
not
one
which
has
not
left
behind
it
a
tomb
in
memory
of
its
passage
the
most
durable
monument
of
human
labor
is
that
which
recalls
the
wretchedness
and
nothingness
of
man
although
the
vast
country
which
we
have
been
describing
was
inhabited
by
many
indigenous
tribes
it
may
justly
be
said
at
the
time
of
its
discovery
by
europeans
to
have
formed
one
great
desert
the
indians
occupied
without
possessing
it
it
is
by
agricultural
labor
that
man
appropriates
the
soil
and
the
early
inhabitants
of
north
america
lived
by
the
produce
of
the
chase
their
implacable
prejudices
their
uncontrolled
passions
their
vices
and
still
more
perhaps
their
savage
virtues
consigned
them
to
inevitable
destruction
the
ruin
of
these
nations
began
from
the
day
when
europeans
landed
on
their
shores
it
has
proceeded
ever
since
and
we
are
now
seeing
the
completion
of
it
they
seemed
to
have
been
placed
by
providence
amid
the
riches
of
the
new
world
to
enjoy
them
for
a
season
and
then
surrender
them
those
coasts
so
admirably
adapted
for
commerce
and
industry
those
wide
and
deep
rivers
that
inexhaustible

in
short
seemed

be

the
great
experiment
was
to
be
made
by

it

to
their
rise
affect
the
whole
term
of
their
being
if
we
were
able
to
go
back
to
the
elements
of
states
and
to
examine
the
oldest
monuments
of
their
history
i
doubt
not
that
we
should
discover
the
primary
cause
of
the
prejudices
the
habits
the
ruling
passions
and
in
short
of
all
that
constitutes
what
is
called
the
national
character
we
should
then
find
the
explanation
of
certain
customs
which
now
seem
at
variance
with
prevailing
manners
of
such
laws
as
conflict
with
established
principles
and
of
such
incoherent
opinions
as
are
here
and
there
to
be
met
with
in
society
like
those
fragments
of
broken
chains
which
we
sometimes
see
hanging
from
the
vault
of
an
edifice
and
supporting
nothing
this
might
explain
the
destinies
of
certain
nations
which
seem
borne
along
by
an
unknown
force
to
ends
of
which
they
themselves
are
ignorant
but
hitherto
facts
have
been
wanting
to
researches
of
this
kind
the
spirit
of
inquiry
has
only
come
upon
communities
in
their
latter
days
and
when
they
at
length
turned
their
attention
to
contemplate
their
origin
time
had
already
obscured
it
or
ignorance
and
pride
adorned
it
with
fables
america
is
the
only
country
in
which
it
has
been
possible
to
study
the
natural
and
tranquil
growth
of
society
and
where
the
influence
exercised
on
the
future
condition
of
states
by
their
origin
is
clearly
distinguishable
at
the
period
when
the
people
of
europe
landed
in
the
new
world
their
national
characteristics
were
already
completely
formed
each
of
them
had
a
physiognomy
of
its
own
and
as
they
had
already
attained
that
stage
of
civilisation
at
which
men
are
led
to
study
themselves
they
have
transmitted
to
us
a
faithful
picture
of
their
opinions
their
manners
and
their
laws
the
men
of
the
sixteenth
century
are
almost
as
well
known
to
us
as
our
contemporaries
america
consequently
exhibits
in
the
broad
light
of
day
the
phenomena
which
the
ignorance
or
rudeness
of
earlier
ages
conceals
from
our
researches
near
enough
to
the
time
when
the
states
of
america
were
founded
to
be
accurately
acquainted
with
their
elements
and
sufficiently
removed
from
that
period
to
judge
of
some
of
their
results
the
men
of
our
own
day
seem
destined
to
see
farther
than
their
predecessors
into
the
series
of
human
events
providence
has
given
us
a
torch
which
our
forefathers
did
not
possess
and
has
allowed
us
to
discern
fundamental
causes
in
the
history
of
the
world
which
the
obscurity
of
the
past
concealed
from
them
if
we
carefully
examine
the
social
and
political
state
of
america
after
having
studied
its
history
we
shall
remain
perfectly
convinced
that
not
an
opinion
not
a
custom
not
a
law
i
may
even
say
not
an
event
is
upon
record
which
the
origin
of
that
people
will
not
explain
the
readers
of
this
book
will
find
the
germe
of
all
that
is
to
follow
in
the
present
chapter
and
the
key
to
almost
the
whole
work
the
emigrants
who
came
at
different
periods
to
occupy
the
territory
now
covered
by
the
american
union
differed
from
each
other
in
many
respects
their
aim
was
not
the
same
and
they
governed
themselves
on
different
principles
these
men
had
however
certain
features
in
common
and
they
were
all
placed
in
an
analogous
situation
the
tie
of
language
is
perhaps
the
strongest
and
most
durable
that
can
unite
mankind
all
the
emigrants
spoke
the
same
tongue
they
were
all
offsets
from
the
same
people
born
in
a
country
which
had
been
agitated
for
centuries
by
the
struggles
of
faction
and
in
which
all
parties
had
been
obliged
in
their
turn
to
place
themselves
under
the
protection
of
the
laws
their
political
education
had
been
perfected
in
this
rude
school
and
they
were
more
conversant
with
the
notions
of
right
and
the
principles
of
true
freedom
than
the
greater
part
of
their
european
contemporaries
at
the
period
of
the
first
emigrations
the
parish
system
that
fruitful
germe
of
free
institutions
was
deeply
rooted
in
the
habits
of
the
english
and
with
it
the
doctrine
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
had
been
introduced
even
into
the
bosom
of
the
monarchy
of
the
house
of
tudor
the
religious
quarrels
which
have
agitated
the
christian
world
were
then
rife
england
had
plunged
into
the
new
order
of
things
with
headlong
vehemence
the
character
of
its
inhabitants
which
had
always
been
sedate
and
reflecting
became
argumentative
and
austere
general
information
had
been
increased
by
intellectual
debate
and
the
mind
had
received
a
deeper
cultivation
while
religion
was
the
topic
of
discussion
the
morals
of
the
people
were
reformed
all
these
national
features
are
more
or
less
discoverable
in
the
physiognomy
of
those
adventurers
who
came
to
seek
a
new
home
on
the
opposite
shores
of
the
atlantic
another
remark
to
which
we
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
recur
is
applicable
not
only
to
the
english
but
to
the
french
the
spaniards
and
all
the
europeans
who
successively
established
themselves
in
the
new
world
all
these
european
colonies
contained
the
elements
if
not
the
development
of
a
complete
democracy
two
causes
led
to
this
result
it
may
safely
be
advanced
that
on
leaving
the
the
emigrants
had
in
general
no
notion
of
superiority
over
one
another
the
happy
and
the
powerful
do
not
go
into
exile
and
there
are
no
surer
guarantees
of
equality
among
men
than
poverty
and
misfortune
it
happened
however
on
several
occasions
that
persons
of
rank
were
driven
to
america
by
political
and
religious
quarrels
laws
were
made
to
establish
a
gradation
of
ranks
but
it
was
soon
found
that
the
soil
of
america
was
entirely
opposed
to
a
territorial
aristocracy
to
bring
that
refractory
land
into
cultivation
the
constant
and
interested
exertions
of
the
owner
himself
were
necessary
and
when
the
ground
was
prepared
its
produce
was
found
to
be
insufficient
to
enrich
a
master
and
a
farmer
at
the
same
time
the
land
was
then
naturally
broken
up
into
small
portions
which
the
proprietor
cultivated
for
himself
land
is
the
basis
of
an
aristocracy
which
clings
to
the
soil
that
supports
it
for
it
is
not
by
privileges
alone
nor
by
birth
but
by
landed
property
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
that
an
aristocracy
is
constituted
a
nation
may
present
immense
fortunes
and
extreme
wretchedness
but
unless
those
fortunes
are
territorial
there
is
no
aristocracy
but
simply
the
class
of
the
rich
and
that
of
the
poor
all
the
british
colonies
had
then
a
great
degree
of
similarity
at
the
epoch
of
their
settlement
all
of
them
from
their
first
beginning
seemed
destined
to
behold
the
growth
not
of
the
aristocratic
liberty
of
their
but
of
that
freedom
of
the
middle
and
lower
orders
of
which
the
history
of
the
world
has
as
yet
furnished
no
complete
example
in
this
general
uniformity
several
striking
differences
were
however
discernible
which
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
two
branches
may
be
distinguished
in
the
family
which
have
hitherto
grown
up
without
entirely
commingling
the
one
in
the
south
the
other
in
the
north
virginia
received
the
first
english
colony
the
emigrants
took
possession
of
it
in
the
idea
that
mines
of
gold
and
silver
are
the
sources
of
national
wealth
was
at
that
time
singularly
prevalent
in
europe
a
fatal
delusion
which
has
done
more
to
impoverish
the
nations
which
adopted
it
and
has
cost
more
lives
in
america
than
the
united
influence
of
war
and
bad
laws
the
men
sent
to
virginia
were
seekers
of
gold
adventurers
without
resources
and
without
character
whose
turbulent
and
restless
spirits
endangered
the
infant
colony
and
rendered
its
progress
uncertain
the
artisans
and
agriculturists
arrived
afterward
and
although
they
were
a
more
moral
and
orderly
race
of
men
they
were
in
nowise
above
the
level
of
the
inferior
classes
in
england
no
lofty
conceptions
no
intellectual
system
directed
the
foundation
of
these
new
settlements
the
colony
was
scarcely
established
when
slavery
was
introduced
and
this
was
the
main
circumstance
which
has
exercised
so
prodigious
an
influence
on
the
character
the
laws
and
all
the
future
prospects
of
the
south
slavery
as
we
shall
afterward
show
dishonors
labor
it
introduces
idleness
into
society
and
with
idleness
ignorance
and
pride
luxury
and
distress
it
enervates
the
powers
of
the
mind
and
benumbs
the
activity
of
man
the
influence
of
slavery
united
to
the
english
character
explains
the
mariners
and
the
social
condition
of
the
southern
states
in
the
north
the
same
english
foundation
was
modified
by
the
most
opposite
shades
of
character
and
here
i
may
be
allowed
to
enter
into
some
details
the
two
or
three
main
ideas
which
constitute
the
basis
of
the
social
theory
of
the
united
states
were
first
combined
in
the
northern
british
colonies
more
generally
denominated
the
states
of
new
england
the
principles
of
new
england
spread
at
first
to
the
neighboring
states
they
then
passed
successively
to
the
more
distant
ones
and
at
length
they
embued
the
whole
confederation
they
now
extend
their
influence
beyond
its
limits
over
the
whole
american
world
the
civilisation
of
new
england
has
been
like
a
beacon
lit
upon
a
hill
which
after
it
has
diffused
its
warmth
around
tinges
the
distant
horizon
with
its
glow
the
foundation
of
new
england
was
a
novel
spectacle
and
all
the
circumstances
attending
it
were
singular
and
original
the
large
majority
of
colonies
have
been
first
inhabited
either
by
men
without
education
and
without
resources
driven
by
their
poverty
and
their
misconduct
from
the
land
which
gave
them
birth
or
by
speculators
and
adventurers
greedy
of
gain
some
settlements
can
not
even
boast
so
honorable
an
origin
domingo
was
founded
by
buccaneers
and
at
the
present
day
the
criminal
courts
of
england
supply
the
population
of
australia
the
settlers
who
established
themselves
on
the
shores
of
new
england
all
belonged
to
the
more
independent
classes
of
their
native
country
their
union
on
the
soil
of
america
at
once
presented
the
singular
phenomenon
of
a
society
containing
neither
lords
nor
common
people
neither
rich
nor
poor
these
men
possessed
in
proportion
to
their
number
a
greater
mass
of
intelligence
than
is
to
be
found
in
any
european
nation
of
our
own
time
all
without
a
single
exception
had
received
a
good
education
and
many
of
them
were
known
in
europe
for
their
talents
and
their
acquirements
the
other
colonies
had
been
founded
by
adventurers
without
family
the
emigrants
of
new
england
brought
with
them
the
best
elements
of
order
and
morality
they
landed
in
the
desert
accompanied
by
their
wives
and
children
but
what
most
especially
distinguished
them
was
the
aim
of
their
undertaking
they
had
not
been
obliged
by
necessity
to
leave
their
country
the
social
position
they
abandoned
was
one
to
be
regretted
and
their
means
of
subsistence
were
certain
nor
did
they
cross
the
atlantic
to
improve
their
situation
or
to
increase
their
wealth
the
call
which
summoned
them
from
the
comforts
of
their
homes
was
purely
intellectual
and
in
facing
the
inevitable
sufferings
of
exile
their
object
was
the
triumph
of
an
idea
the
emigrants
or
as
they
deservedly
styled
themselves
the
pilgrims
belonged
to
that
english
sect
the
austerity
of
whose
principles
had
acquired
for
them
the
name
of
puritans
puritanism
was
not
merely
a
religious
doctrine
but
it
corresponded
in
many
points
with
the
most
absolute
democratic
and
republican
theories
it
was
this
tendency
which
had
aroused
its
most
dangerous
adversaries
persecuted
by
the
government
of
the
and
disgusted
by
the
habits
of
a
society
opposed
to
the
rigor
of
their
own
principles
the
puritans
went
forth
to
seek
some
rude
and
unfrequented
part
of
the
world
where
they
could
live
according
to
their
own
opinions
and
worship
god
in
freedom
a
few
quotations
will
throw
more
light
upon
the
spirit
of
these
pious
adventurers
than
all
we
can
say
of
them
nathaniel
morton
the
historian
of
the
first
years
of
the
settlement
thus
opens
his
subject
gentle
reader
i
have
for
some
length
of
time
looked
upon
it
as
a
duty
incumbent
especially
on
the
immediate
successors
of
those
that
have
had
so
large
experience
of
those
many
memorable
and
signal
demonstrations
of
god
goodness
the
first
beginning
of
this
plantation
in
new
england
to
commit
to
writing
his
gracious
dispensations
on
that
behalf
having
so
many
inducements
thereunto
not
only
otherwise
but
so
plentifully
in
the
sacred
scriptures
that
so
what
we
have
seen
and
what
our
fathers
have
told
us
psalm
we
may
not
hide
from
our
children
showing
to
the
generations
to
come
the
praises
of
the
lord
that
especially
the
seed
of
abraham
his
servant
and
the
children
of
jacob
his
chosen
psalm
may
remember
his
marvellous
works
in
the
beginning
and
progress
of
the
planting
of
new
england
his
wonders
and
the
judgments
of
his
mouth
how
that
god
brought
a
vine
into
this
wilderness
that
he
cast
out
the
heathen
and
planted
it
that
he
made
room
for
it
and
caused
it
to
take
deep
root
and
it
filled
the
land
psalm
and
not
onely
so
but
also
that
he
hath
guided
his
people
by
his
strength
to
his
holy
habitation
and
planted
them
in
the
mountain
of
his
inheritance
in
respect
of
precious
gospel
enjoyments
and
that
as
especially
god
may
have
the
glory
of
all
unto
whom
it
is
most
due
so
also
some
rays
of
glory
may
reach
the
names
of
those
blessed
saints
that
were
the
main
instruments
and
the
beginning
of
this
happy
enterprise
it
is
impossible
to
read
this
opening
paragraph
without
an
involuntary
feeling
of
religious
awe
it
breathes
the
very
savor
of
gospel
antiquity
the
sincerity
of
the
author
heightens
his
power
of
language
the
band
which
to
his
eyes
was
a
mere
party
of
adventurers
gone
forth
to
seek
their
fortune
beyond
the
seas
appears
to
the
reader
as
the
germe
of
a
great
nation
wafted
by
providence
to
a
predestined
shore
the
author
thus
continues
his
narrative
of
the
departure
of
the
first
pilgrims
so
they
left
that
goodly
and
pleasant
city
of
leyden
which
had
been
their
for
above
eleven
years
but
they
knew
that
they
were
pilgrims
and
strangers
here
below
and
looked
not
much
on
these
things
but
lifted
up
their
eyes
to
heaven
their
dearest
country
where
god
hath
prepared
for
them
a
city
heb
and
therein
quieted
their
spirits
when
they
came
to
they
found
the
ship
and
all
things
ready
and
such
of
their
friends
as
could
come
with
them
followed
after
them
and
sundry
came
from
amsterdam
to
see
them
shipt
and
to
take
their
leaves
of
them
one
night
was
spent
with
little
sleep
with
the
most
but
with
friendly
entertainment
and
christian
discourse
and
other
real
expressions
of
true
christian
love
the
next
day
they
went
on
board
and
their
friends
with
them
where
truly
doleful
was
the
sight
of
that
sad
and
mournful
parting
to
hear
what
sighs
and
sobs
and
prayers
did
sound
among
them
what
tears
did
gush
from
every
eye
and
pithy
speeches
pierced
each
other
heart
that
sundry
of
the
dutch
strangers
that
stood
on
the
key
as
spectators
could
not
refrain
from
tears
but
the
tide
which
stays
for
no
man
calling
them
away
that
were
thus
loath
to
depart
their
reverend
pastor
falling
down
on
his
knees
and
they
all
with
him
with
watery
cheeks
commended
them
with
most
fervent
prayers
unto
the
lord
and
his
blessing
and
then
with
mutual
embraces
and
many
tears
they
took
their
leaves
one
of
another
which
proved
to
be
the
last
leave
to
many
of
them
the
emigrants
were
about
in
number
including
the
women
and
the
children
their
object
was
to
plant
a
colony
on
the
shores
of
the
hudson
but
after
having
been
driven
about
for
some
time
in
the
atlantic
ocean
they
were
forced
to
land
on
that
arid
coast
of
new
england
which
is
now
the
site
of
the
town
of
plymouth
the
rock
is
still
shown
on
which
the
pilgrims
disembarked
but
before
we
pass
on
continues
our
historian
let
the
reader
with
me
make
a
pause
and
seriously
consider
this
poor
people
present
condition
the
more
to
be
raised
up
to
admiration
of
god
goodness
toward
them
in
their
preservation
for
being
now
passed
the
vast
ocean
and
a
sea
of
troubles
before
them
in
expectation
they
had
now
no
friends
to
welcome
them
no
inns
to
entertain
or
refresh
them
no
houses
or
much
less
towns
to
repair
unto
to
seek
for
succor
and
for
the
season
it
was
winter
and
they
that
know
the
winters
of
the
country
know
them
to
be
sharp
and
violent
subject
to
cruel
and
fierce
storms
dangerous
to
travel
to
known
places
much
more
to
search
unknown
coasts
besides
what
could
they
see
but
a
hideous
and
desolate
wilderness
full
of
wilde
beasts
and
wilde
men
and
what
multitudes
of
them
there
were
they
then
knew
not
for
which
way
soever
they
turned
their
eyes
save
upward
to
heaven
they
could
have
but
little
solace
or
content
in
respect
of
any
outward
object
for
summer
being
ended
all
things
stand
in
appearance
with
a
face
and
the
whole
country
full
of
woods
and
thickets
represented
a
wild
and
savage
hue
if
they
looked
behind
them
there
was
the
mighty
ocean
which
they
had
passed
and
was
now
as
a
main
bar
or
gulph
to
separate
them
from
all
the
civil
parts
of
the
world
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
the
piety
of
the
puritans
was
of
a
merely
speculative
kind
or
that
it
took
no
cognizance
of
the
course
of
worldly
affairs
puritanism
as
i
have
already
remarked
was
scarcely
less
a
political
than
a
religious
doctrine
no
sooner
had
the
emigrants
landed
on
the
barren
coast
described
by
nathaniel
morton
than
their
first
care
was
to
constitute
a
society
by
passing
the
following
act
in
the
name
of
god
amen
we
whose
names
are
underwritten
the
loyal
subjects
of
our
dread
sovereign
lord
king
james
having
undertaken
for
the
glory
of
god
and
advancement
of
the
christian
faith
and
the
honor
of
our
king
and
country
a
voyage
to
plant
the
first
colony
in
the
northern
parts
of
virginia
do
by
these
presents
solemnly
and
mutually
in
the
presence
of
god
and
one
another
covenant
and
combine
ourselves
together
into
a
civil
body
politic
for
our
better
ordering
and
preservation
and
furtherance
of
the
ends
aforesaid
and
by
virtue
hereof
do
enact
constitute
and
frame
such
just
and
equal
laws
ordinances
acts
constitutions
and
officers
from
time
to
time
as
shall
be
thought
most
meet
and
convenient
for
the
general
good
of
the
colony
unto
which
we
promise
all
due
submission
and
obedience
this
happened
in
and
from
that
time
forward
the
emigration
went
on
the
religious
and
political
passions
which
ravished
the
british
empire
during
the
whole
reign
of
charles
drove
fresh
crowds
of
sectarians
every
year
to
the
shores
of
america
in
england
the
stronghold
of
puritanism
was
in
the
middle
classes
and
it
was
from
the
middle
classes
that
the
majority
of
the
emigrants
came
the
population
of
new
england
increased
rapidly
and
while
the
hierarchy
of
rank
despotically
classed
the
inhabitants
of
the
the
colony
continued
to
present
the
novel
spectacle
of
a
community
homogeneous
in
all
its
parts
a
democracy
more
perfect
than
any
which
antiquity
had
dreamed
of
started
in
full
size
and
panoply
from
the
midst
of
an
ancient
feudal
society
the
english
government
was
not
dissatisfied
with
an
emigration
which
removed
the
elements
of
fresh
discord
and
of
future
revolutions
on
the
contrary
everything
was
done
to
encourage
it
and
little
attention
was
paid
to
the
destiny
of
those
who
sought
a
shelter
from
the
rigor
of
their
country
laws
on
the
soil
of
america
it
seemed
as
if
new
england
was
a
region
given
up
to
the
dreams
of
fancy
and
the
unrestrained
experiments
of
innovators
the
english
colonies
and
this
is
one
of
the
main
causes
of
their
prosperity
have
always
enjoyed
more
internal
freedom
and
more
political
independence
than
the
colonies
of
other
nations
but
this
principle
of
liberty
was
nowhere
more
extensively
applied
than
in
the
states
of
new
england
it
was
generally
allowed
at
that
period
that
the
territories
of
the
new
world
belonged
to
that
european
nation
which
had
been
the
first
to
discover
them
nearly
the
whole
coast
of
north
america
thus
became
a
british
possession
toward
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
means
used
by
the
english
government
to
people
these
new
domains
were
of
several
kinds
the
king
sometimes
appointed
a
governor
of
his
own
choice
who
ruled
a
portion
of
the
new
world
in
the
name
and
under
the
immediate
orders
of
the
crown
this
is
the
colonial
system
adopted
by
the
other
countries
of
europe
sometimes
grants
of
certain
tracts
were
made
by
the
crown
to
an
individual
or
to
a
company
in
which
case
all
the
civil
and
political
power
fell
into
the
hands
of
one
or
more
persons
who
under
the
inspection
and
control
of
the
crown
sold
the
lands
and
governed
the
inhabitants
lastly
a
third
system
consisted
in
allowing
a
certain
number
of
emigrants
to
constitute
a
political
society
under
the
protection
of
the
and
to
govern
themselves
in
whatever
was
not
contrary
to
her
laws
this
mode
of
colonization
so
remarkably
favorable
to
liberty
was
adopted
only
in
new
england
in
a
charter
of
this
kind
was
granted
by
charles
to
the
emigrants
who
went
to
form
the
colony
of
massachusetts
but
in
general
charters
were
not
given
to
the
colonies
of
new
england
till
they
had
acquired
a
certain
existence
plymouth
providence
new
haven
the
state
of
connecticut
and
that
of
rhode
island
were
founded
without
the
and
almost
without
the
knowledge
of
the
the
new
settlers
did
not
derive
their
incorporation
from
the
head
of
the
empire
although
they
did
not
deny
its
supremacy
they
constituted
a
society
of
their
own
accord
and
it
was
not
till
thirty
or
forty
years
afterward
under
charles
that
their
existence
was
legally
recognised
by
a
royal
charter
this
frequently
renders
it
difficult
to
detect
the
link
which
connected
the
emigrants
with
the
land
of
their
forefathers
in
studying
the
earliest
historical
and
legislative
records
of
new
england
they
perpetually
exercised
the
rights
of
sovereignty
they
named
their
magistrates
concluded
peace
or
declared
war
made
police
regulations
and
enacted
laws
as
if
their
allegiance
was
due
only
to
god
nothing
can
be
more
curious
and
at
the
same
time
more
instructive
than
the
legislation
of
that
period
it
is
there
that
the
solution
of
the
great
social
problem
which
the
united
states
now
present
to
the
world
is
to
be
found
among
these
documents
we
shall
notice
as
especially
characteristic
the
code
of
laws
promulgated
by
the
little
state
of
connecticut
in
the
legislators
of
connecticut
begin
with
the
penal
laws
and
strange
to
say
they
borrow
their
provisions
from
the
text
of
holy
writ
whoever
shall
worship
any
other
god
than
the
lord
says
the
preamble
of
the
code
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
this
is
followed
by
ten
or
twelve
enactments
of
the
same
kind
copied
verbatim
from
the
books
of
exodus
leviticus
and
deuteronomy
blasphemy
sorcery
adultery
and
rape
were
punished
with
death
an
outrage
offered
by
a
son
to
his
parents
was
to
be
expiated
by
the
same
penalty
the
legislation
of
a
rude
and
people
was
thus
transferred
to
an
enlightened
and
moral
community
the
consequence
was
that
the
punishment
of
death
was
never
more
frequently
prescribed
by
the
statute
and
never
more
rarely
enforced
toward
the
guilty
the
chief
care
of
the
legislators
in
this
body
of
penal
laws
was
the
maintenance
of
orderly
conduct
and
good
morals
in
the
community
they
constantly
invaded
the
domain
of
conscience
and
there
was
scarcely
a
sin
which
they
did
not
subject
to
magisterial
censure
the
reader
is
aware
of
the
rigor
with
which
these
laws
punished
rape
and
adultery
intercourse
between
unmarried
persons
was
likewise
severely
repressed
the
judge
was
empowered
to
inflict
a
pecuniary
penalty
a
whipping
or
marriage
on
the
misdemeanants
and
if
the
records
of
the
old
courts
of
new
haven
may
be
believed
prosecutions
of
this
kind
were
not
infrequent
we
find
a
sentence
bearing
date
the
first
of
may
inflicting
a
fine
and
a
reprimand
on
a
young
woman
who
was
accused
of
using
improper
language
and
of
allowing
herself
to
be
kissed
the
code
of
abounds
in
preventive
measures
it
punishes
idleness
and
drunkenness
with
severity
innkeepers
are
forbidden
to
furnish
more
than
a
certain
quantity
of
liquor
to
each
customer
and
simple
lying
whenever
it
may
be
injurious
is
checked
by
a
fine
or
a
flogging
in
other
places
the
legislator
entirely
forgetting
the
great
principles
of
religious
toleration
which
he
had
himself
upheld
in
europe
renders
attendance
on
divine
service
compulsory
and
goes
so
far
as
to
visit
with
severe
punishment
and
even
with
death
the
christians
who
chose
to
worship
god
according
to
a
ritual
differing
from
his
own
sometimes
indeed
the
zeal
of
his
enactments
induces
him
to
descend
to
the
most
frivolous
particulars
thus
a
law
is
to
be
found
in
the
same
code
which
prohibits
the
use
of
tobacco
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
these
fantastical
and
vexatious
laws
were
not
imposed
by
authority
but
that
they
were
freely
voted
by
all
the
persons
interested
and
that
the
manners
of
the
community
were
even
more
austere
and
more
puritanical
than
the
laws
in
a
solemn
association
was
formed
in
boston
to
check
the
worldly
luxury
of
long
hair
these
errors
are
no
doubt
discreditable
to
the
human
reason
they
attest
the
inferiority
of
our
nature
which
is
incapable
of
laying
firm
hold
upon
what
is
true
and
just
and
is
often
reduced
to
the
alternative
of
two
excesses
in
strict
connection
with
this
penal
legislation
which
bears
such
striking
marks
of
a
narrow
sectarian
spirit
and
of
those
religious
passions
which
had
been
warmed
by
persecution
and
were
still
fermenting
among
the
people
a
body
of
political
laws
is
to
be
found
which
though
written
two
hundred
years
ago
is
still
ahead
of
the
liberties
of
our
age
the
general
principles
which
are
the
groundwork
of
modern
constitutions
principles
which
were
imperfectly
known
in
europe
and
not
completely
triumphant
even
in
great
britain
in
the
seventeenth
century
were
all
recognised
and
determined
by
the
laws
of
new
england
the
intervention
of
the
people
in
public
affairs
the
free
voting
of
taxes
the
responsibility
of
authorities
personal
liberty
and
trial
by
jury
were
all
positively
established
without
discussion
from
these
fruitful
principles
consequences
have
been
derived
and
applications
have
been
made
such
as
no
nation
in
europe
has
yet
ventured
to
attempt
in
connecticut
the
electoral
body
consisted
from
its
origin
of
the
whole
number
of
citizens
and
this
is
readily
to
be
understood
when
we
recollect
that
this
people
enjoyed
an
almost
perfect
equality
of
fortune
and
a
still
greater
uniformity
of
capacity
in
connecticut
at
this
period
all
the
executive
functionaries
were
elected
including
the
governor
of
the
state
the
citizens
above
the
age
of
sixteen
were
obliged
to
bear
arms
they
formed
a
national
militia
which
appointed
its
own
officers
and
was
to
hold
itself
at
all
times
in
readiness
to
march
for
the
defence
of
the
country
in
the
laws
of
connecticut
as
well
as
in
those
of
new
england
we
find
the
germe
and
gradual
development
of
that
township
independence
which
is
the
life
and
mainspring
of
american
liberty
at
the
present
day
the
political
existence
of
the
majority
of
the
nations
of
europe
commenced
in
the
superior
ranks
of
society
and
was
gradually
and
always
imperfectly
communicated
to
the
different
members
of
the
social
body
in
america
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
said
that
the
township
was
organized
before
the
county
the
county
before
the
state
the
state
before
the
union
in
new
england
townships
were
completely
and
definitively
constituted
as
early
as
the
independence
of
the
township
was
the
nucleus
around
which
the
local
interests
passions
rights
and
duties
collected
and
clung
it
gave
scope
to
the
activity
of
a
real
political
life
most
thoroughly
democratic
and
republican
the
colonies
still
recognised
the
supremacy
of
the
monarchy
was
still
the
law
of
the
state
but
the
republic
was
already
established
in
every
township
the
towns
named
their
own
magistrates
of
every
kind
rated
themselves
and
levied
their
own
taxes
in
the
townships
of
new
england
the
law
of
representation
was
not
adopted
but
the
affairs
of
the
community
were
discussed
as
at
athens
in
the
by
a
general
assembly
of
the
citizens
in
studying
the
laws
which
were
promulgated
at
this
first
era
of
the
american
republics
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
struck
by
the
remarkable
acquaintance
with
the
science
of
government
and
the
advanced
theory
of
legislation
which
they
display
the
ideas
there
formed
of
the
duties
of
society
toward
its
members
are
evidently
much
loftier
and
more
comprehensive
than
those
of
the
european
legislators
at
that
time
obligations
were
there
imposed
which
were
elsewhere
slighted
in
the
states
of
new
england
from
the
first
the
condition
of
the
poor
was
provided
for
strict
measures
were
taken
for
the
maintenance
of
roads
and
surveyors
were
appointed
to
attend
to
them
registers
were
established
in
every
parish
in
which
the
results
of
public
deliberations
and
the
births
deaths
and
marriages
of
the
citizens
were
entered
clerks
were
directed
to
keep
these
registers
officers
were
charged
with
the
administration
of
vacant
inheritances
and
with
the
arbitration
of
litigated
landmarks
and
many
others
were
created
whose
chief
functions
were
the
maintenance
of
public
order
in
the
community
the
law
enters
into
a
thousand
useful
provisions
for
a
number
of
social
wants
which
are
at
present
very
inadequately
felt
in
france
but
it
is
by
the
attention
it
pays
to
public
education
that
the
original
character
of
american
civilisation
is
at
once
placed
in
the
clearest
light
it
being
says
the
law
one
chief
project
of
satan
to
keep
men
from
the
knowledge
of
the
scripture
by
persuading
from
the
use
of
tongues
to
the
end
that
learning
may
not
be
buried
in
the
graves
of
our
forefathers
in
church
and
commonwealth
the
lord
assisting
our
endeavors
here
follow
clauses
establishing
schools
in
every
township
and
obliging
the
inhabitants
under
pain
of
heavy
fines
to
support
them
schools
of
a
superior
kind
were
founded
in
the
same
manner
in
the
more
populous
districts
the
municipal
authorities
were
bound
to
enforce
the
sending
of
children
to
school
by
their
parents
they
were
empowered
to
inflict
fines
upon
all
who
refused
compliance
and
in
cases
of
continued
resistance
society
assumed
the
place
of
the
parent
took
possession
of
the
child
and
deprived
the
father
of
those
natural
rights
which
he
used
to
so
bad
a
purpose
the
reader
will
undoubtedly
have
remarked
the
preamble
of
these
enactments
in
america
religion
is
the
road
to
knowledge
and
the
observance
of
the
divine
laws
leads
men
to
civil
freedom
if
after
having
cast
a
rapid
glance
over
the
state
of
american
society
in
we
turn
to
the
condition
of
europe
and
more
especially
to
that
of
the
continent
at
the
same
period
we
can
not
fail
to
be
struck
with
astonishment
on
the
continent
of
europe
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
absolute
monarchy
had
everywhere
triumphed
over
the
ruins
of
the
oligarchical
and
feudal
liberties
of
the
middle
ages
never
were
the
notions
of
right
more
completely
confounded
than
in
the
midst
of
the
splendor
and
literature
of
europe
never
was
there
less
political
activity
among
the
people
never
were
the
principles
of
true
freedom
less
widely
circulated
and
at
that
very
time
those
principles
which
were
scorned
or
unknown
by
the
nations
of
europe
were
proclaimed
in
the
deserts
of
the
new
world
and
were
accepted
as
the
future
creed
of
a
great
people
the
boldest
theories
of
the
human
reason
were
put
into
practice
by
a
community
so
humble
that
not
a
statesman
condescended
to
attend
to
it
and
a
legislation
without
precedent
was
produced
by
the
imagination
of
the
citizens
in
the
bosom
of
this
obscure
democracy
which
had
as
yet
brought
forth
neither
generals
nor
philosophers
nor
authors
a
man
might
stand
up
in
the
face
of
a
free
people
and
pronounce
amid
general
acclamations
the
following
fine
definition
of
liberty
nor
would
i
have
you
to
mistake
in
the
point
of
your
own
liberty
there
is
a
liberty
of
corrupt
nature
which
is
affected
both
by
men
and
beasts
to
do
what
they
list
and
this
liberty
is
inconsistent
with
authority
impatient
of
all
restraint
by
this
liberty
omnes
it
is
the
grand
enemy
of
truth
and
peace
and
all
the
ordinances
of
god
are
bent
against
it
but
there
is
a
civil
a
moral
a
federal
liberty
which
is
the
proper
end
and
object
of
authority
it
is
a
liberty
for
that
only
which
is
just
and
good
for
this
liberty
you
are
to
stand
with
the
hazard
of
your
very
lives
and
whatsoever
crosses
it
is
not
authority
but
a
distemper
thereof
this
liberty
is
maintained
in
a
way
of
subjection
to
authority
and
the
authority
set
over
you
will
in
all
administrations
for
your
good
be
quietly
submitted
unto
by
all
but
such
as
have
a
disposition
to
shake
off
the
yoke
and
lose
their
true
liberty
by
their
murmuring
at
the
honor
and
power
of
authority
the
remarks
i
have
made
will
suffice
to
display
the
character
of
civilisation
in
its
true
light
it
is
the
result
and
this
should
be
constantly
present
to
the
mind
of
two
distinct
elements
which
in
other
places
have
been
in
frequent
hostility
but
which
in
america
have
admirably
incorporated
and
combined
with
one
another
i
allude
to
the
spirit
of
religion
and
the
spirit
of
liberty
the
settlers
of
new
england
were
at
the
same
time
ardent
sectarians
and
daring
innovators
narrow
as
the
limits
of
some
of
their
religious
opinions
were
they
were
entirely
free
from
political
prejudices
hence
arose
two
tendencies
distinct
but
not
opposite
which
are
constantly
discernible
in
the
manners
as
well
as
in
the
laws
of
the
country
it
might
be
imagined
that
men
who
sacrificed
their
friends
their
family
and
their
native
land
to
a
religious
conviction
were
absorbed
in
the
pursuit
of
the
intellectual
advantages
which
they
purchased
at
so
dear
a
rate
the
energy
however
with
which
they
strove
for
the
acquirements
of
wealth
moral
enjoyment
and
the
comforts
as
well
as
the
liberties
of
the
world
was
scarcely
inferior
to
that
with
which
they
devoted
themselves
to
heaven
political
principles
and
all
human
laws
and
institutions
were
moulded
and
altered
at
their
pleasure
the
barriers
of
the
society
in
which
they
were
born
were
broken
down
before
them
the
old
principles
which
had
governed
the
world
for
ages
were
no
more
a
path
without
a
turn
and
a
field
without
a
horizon
were
opened
to
the
exploring
and
ardent
curiosity
of
man
but
at
the
limits
of
the
political
world
he
checks
his
researches
he
discreetly
lays
aside
the
use
of
his
most
formidable
faculties
he
no
longer
consents
to
doubt
or
to
innovate
but
carefully
abstaining
from
raising
the
curtain
of
the
sanctuary
he
yields
with
submissive
respect
to
truths
which
he
will
not
discuss
thus
in
the
moral
world
everything
is
classed
adapted
decided
and
foreseen
in
the
political
world
everything
is
agitated
uncertain
and
disputed
in
the
one
is
a
passive
though
a
voluntary
obedience
in
the
other
an
independence
scornful
of
experience
and
jealous
of
authority
these
two
tendencies
apparently
so
discrepant
are
far
from
conflicting
they
advance
together
and
mutually
support
each
other
religion
perceives
that
civil
liberty
affords
a
noble
exercise
to
the
faculties
of
man
and
that
the
political
world
is
a
field
prepared
by
the
creator
for
the
efforts
of
the
intelligence
contented
with
the
freedom
and
the
power
which
it
enjoys
in
its
own
sphere
and
with
the
place
which
it
occupies
the
empire
of
religion
is
never
more
surely
established
than
when
it
reigns
in
the
hearts
of
men
unsupported
by
aught
besides
its
native
strength
religion
is
no
less
the
companion
of
liberty
in
all
its
battles
and
its
triumphs
the
cradle
of
its
infancy
and
the
divine
source
of
its
claims
the
safeguard
of
morality
is
religion
and
morality
is
the
best
security
of
law
as
well
as
the
surest
pledge
of
freedom
reasons
of
certain
anomalies
which
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
present
remains
of
aristocratic
institutions
in
the
midst
of
a
complete
why
distinction
carefully
to
be
drawn
between
what
is
of
puritanical
and
what
is
of
english
origin
the
reader
is
cautioned
not
to
draw
too
general
or
too
absolute
an
inference
from
what
has
been
said
the
social
condition
the
religion
and
the
manners
of
the
first
emigrants
undoubtedly
exercised
an
immense
influence
on
the
destiny
of
their
new
country
nevertheless
it
was
not
in
their
power
to
found
a
state
of
things
originating
solely
in
themselves
no
man
can
entirely
shake
off
the
influence
of
the
past
and
the
settlers
unintentionally
or
involuntarily
mingled
habits
derived
from
their
education
and
from
the
traditions
of
their
country
with
those
habits
and
notions
which
were
exclusively
their
own
to
form
a
judgment
on
the
of
the
present
day
it
is
therefore
necessary
carefully
to
distinguish
what
is
of
puritanical
from
what
is
of
english
origin
laws
and
customs
are
frequently
to
be
met
with
in
the
united
states
which
contrast
strongly
with
all
that
surrounds
them
these
laws
seem
to
be
drawn
up
in
a
spirit
contrary
to
the
prevailing
tenor
of
the
american
legislation
and
these
customs
are
no
less
opposed
to
the
general
tone
of
society
if
the
english
colonies
had
been
founded
in
an
age
of
darkness
or
if
their
origin
was
already
lost
in
the
lapse
of
years
the
problem
would
be
insoluble
i
shall
quote
a
single
example
to
illustrate
what
i
advance
the
civil
and
criminal
procedure
of
the
americans
has
only
two
means
of
action
committal
or
bail
the
first
measure
taken
by
the
magistrate
is
to
exact
security
from
the
defendant
or
in
case
of
refusal
to
incarcerate
him
the
ground
of
the
accusation
and
the
importance
of
the
charges
against
him
are
then
discussed
it
is
evident
that
a
legislation
of
this
kind
is
hostile
to
the
poor
man
and
favorable
only
to
the
rich
the
poor
man
has
not
always
a
security
to
produce
even
in
a
civil
cause
and
if
he
is
obliged
to
wait
for
justice
in
prison
he
is
speedily
reduced
to
distress
the
wealthy
individual
on
the
contrary
always
escapes
imprisonment
in
civil
causes
nay
more
he
may
readily
elude
the
punishment
which
awaits
him
for
a
delinquency
by
breaking
his
bail
so
that
all
the
penalties
of
the
law
are
for
him
reducible
to
fines
nothing
can
be
more
aristocratic
than
this
system
of
legislation
yet
in
america
it
is
the
poor
who
make
the
law
and
they
usually
reserve
the
greatest
social
advantages
to
themselves
the
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
is
to
be
found
in
england
the
laws
of
which
i
speak
are
english
and
the
americans
have
retained
them
however
repugnant
they
may
be
to
the
tenor
of
their
legislation
and
the
mass
of
their
ideas
next
to
its
habits
the
thing
which
a
nation
is
least
apt
to
change
is
its
civil
legislation
civil
laws
are
only
familiarly
known
to
legal
men
whose
direct
interest
it
is
to
maintain
them
as
they
are
whether
good
or
bad
simply
because
they
themselves
are
conversant
with
them
the
body
of
the
nation
is
scarcely
acquainted
with
them
it
merely
perceives
their
action
in
particular
cases
but
it
has
some
difficulty
in
seizing
their
tendency
and
obeys
them
without
reflection
i
have
quoted
one
instance
where
it
would
have
been
easy
to
adduce
a
great
number
of
others
the
surface
of
american
society
is
if
i
may
use
the
expression
covered
with
a
layer
of
democracy

aristocratic

adduced

in
explanation
or

magistrate
is
satisfied
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
that

is
guilty

only
required

innocence

our
system
deserves

the

from
the

that
the

exonerates
the

he

the

so
great
by

by

social
condition
of
the
a
social
condition
is
commonly
the
result
of
circumstances
sometimes
of
laws
oftener
still
of
these
two
causes
united
but
wherever
it
exists
it
may
justly
be
considered
as
the
source
of
almost
all
the
laws
the
usages
and
the
ideas
which
regulate
the
conduct
of
nations
whatever
it
does
not
produce
it
modifies
it
is
therefore
necessary
if
we
would
become
acquainted
with
the
legislation
and
the
manners
of
a
nation
to
begin
by
the
study
of
its
social
condition
the
striking
characteristic
of
the
social
condition
of
the
is
its
essential
democracy
the
first
emigrants
of
new
their
aristocratic
laws
introduced
in
the
period
of
the
change
in
the
law
of
effects
produced
by
this
democracy
carried
to
its
utmost
limits
in
the
new
states
of
the
equality
of
education
many
important
observations
suggest
themselves
upon
the
social
condition
of
the
but
there
is
one
which
takes
precedence
of
all
the
rest
the
social
condition
of
the
americans
is
eminently
democratic
this
was
its
character
at
the
foundation
of
the
colonies
and
is
still
more
strongly
marked
at
the
present
day
i
have
stated
in
the
preceding
chapter
that
great
equality
existed
among
the
emigrants
who
settled
on
the
shores
of
new
england
the
germe
of
aristocracy
was
never
planted
in
that
part
of
the
union
the
only
influence
which
obtained
there
was
that
of
intellect
the
people
were
used
to
reverence
certain
names
as
the
emblems
of
knowledge
and
virtue
some
of
their
acquired
a
power
over
the
rest
which
might
truly
have
been
called
aristocratic
if
it
had
been
capable
of
invariable
transmission
from
father
to
son
this
was
the
state
of
things
to
the
east
of
the
hudson
to
the
southwest
of
that
river
and
in
the
direction
of
the
floridas
the
case
was
different
in
most
of
the
states
situated
to
the
southwest
of
the
hudson
some
great
english
proprietors
had
settled
who
had
imported
with
them
aristocratic
principles
and
the
english
law
of
descent
i
have
explained
the
reasons
why
it
was
impossible
ever
to
establish
a
powerful
aristocracy
in
america
these
reasons
existed
with
less
force
to
the
southwest
of
the
hudson
in
the
south
one
man
aided
by
slaves
could
cultivate
a
great
extent
of
country
it
was
therefore
common
to
see
rich
landed
proprietors
but
their
influence
was
not
altogether
aristocratic
as
that
term
is
understood
in
europe
since
they
possessed
no
privileges
and
the
cultivation
of
their
estates
being
carried
on
by
slaves
they
had
no
tenants
depending
on
them
and
consequently
no
patronage
still
the
great
proprietors
south
of
the
hudson
constituted
a
superior
class
having
ideas
and
tastes
of
its
own
and
forming
the
centre
of
political
action
this
kind
of
aristocracy
sympathized
with
the
body
of
the
people
whose
passions
and
interests
it
easily
embraced
but
it
was
too
weak
and
too
to
excite
either
love
or
hatred
for
itself
this
was
the
class
which
headed
the
insurrection
in
the
south
and
furnished
the
best
leaders
of
the
american
revolution
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
society
was
shaken
to
its
centre
the
people
in
whose
name
the
struggle
had
taken
place
conceived
the
desire
of
exercising
the
authority
which
it
had
acquired
its
democratic
tendencies
were
awakened
and
having
thrown
off
the
yoke
of
the
it
aspired
to
independence
of
every
kind
the
influence
of
individuals
gradually
ceased
to
be
felt
and
custom
and
law
united
together
to
produce
the
same
result
but
the
law
of
descent
was
the
last
step
to
equality
i
am
surprised
that
ancient
and
modern
jurists
have
not
attributed
to
this
law
a
greater
influence
on
human
affairs
it
is
true
that
these
laws
belong
to
civil
affairs
but
they
ought
nevertheless
to
be
placed
at
the
head
of
all
political
institutions
for
while
political
laws
are
only
the
symbol
of
a
nation
condition
they
exercise
an
incredible
influence
upon
its
social
state
they
have
moreover
a
sure
and
uniform
manner
of
operating
upon
society
affecting
as
it
were
generations
yet
unknown
through
their
means
man
acquires
a
kind
of
preternatural
power
over
the
future
lot
of
his
when
the
legislator
has
once
regulated
the
law
of
inheritance
he
may
rest
from
his
labor
the
machine
once
put
in
motion
will
go
on
for
ages
and
advance
as
if
toward
a
given
point
when
framed
in
a
particular
manner
this
law
unites
draws
together
and
vests
property
and
power
in
a
few
hands
its
tendency
is
clearly
aristocratic
on
opposite
principles
its
action
is
still
more
rapid
it
divides
distributes
and
disperses
both
property
and
power
alarmed
by
the
rapidity
of
its
progress
those
who
despair
of
arresting
its
motion
endeavor
to
obstruct
by
difficulties
and
impediments
they
vainly
seek
to
counteract
its
effect
by
contrary
efforts
but
it
gradually
reduces
or
destroys
every
obstacle
until
by
its
incessant
activity
the
bulwarks
of
the
influence
of
wealth
are
ground
down
to
the
fine
and
shifting
sand
which
is
the
basis
of
democracy
when
the
law
of
inheritance
permits
still
more
when
it
decrees
the
equal
division
of
a
father
property
among
all
his
children
its
effects
are
of
two
kinds
it
is
important
to
distinguish
them
from
each
other
although
they
tend
to
the
same
end
in
virtue
of
the
law
of
partible
inheritance
the
death
of
every
proprietor
brings
about
a
kind
of
revolution
in
property
not
only
do
his
possessions
change
hands
but
their
very
nature
is
altered
since
they
are
parcelled
into
shares
which
become
smaller
and
smaller
at
each
division
this
is
the
direct
and
as
it
were
the
physical
effect
of
the
law
it
follows
then
that
in
countries
where
equality
of
inheritance
is
established
by
law
property
and
especially
landed
property
must
have
a
tendency
to
perpetual
diminution
the
effects
however
of
such
legislation
would
only
be
perceptible
after
a
lapse
of
time
if
the
law
was
abandoned
to
its
own
working
for
supposing
a
family
to
consist
of
two
children
and
in
a
country
peopled
as
france
is
the
average
number
is
not
above
three
these
children
sharing
among
them
the
fortune
of
both
parents
would
not
be
poorer
than
their
father
or
mother
but
the
law
of
equal
division
exercises
its
influence
not
merely
upon
the
property
itself
but
it
affects
the
minds
of
the
heirs
and
brings
their
passions
into
play
these
indirect
consequences
tend
powerfully
to
the
destruction
of
large
fortunes
and
especially
of
large
domains
among
the
nations
whose
law
of
descent
is
founded
upon
the
right
of
primogeniture
landed
estates
often
pass
from
generation
to
generation
without
undergoing
division
the
consequence
of
which
is
that
family
feeling
is
to
a
certain
degree
incorporated
with
the
estate
the
family
represents
the
estate
the
estate
the
family
whose
name
together
with
its
origin
its
glory
its
power
and
its
virtues
is
thus
perpetuated
in
an
imperishable
memorial
of
the
past
and
a
sure
pledge
of
the
future
when
the
equal
partition
of
property
is
established
by
law
the
intimate
connection
is
destroyed
between
family
feeling
and
the
preservation
of
the
paternal
estate
the
property
ceases
to
represent
the
family
for
as
it
must
inevitably
be
divided
after
one
or
two
generations
it
has
evidently
a
constant
tendency
to
diminish
and
must
in
the
end
be
completely
dispersed
the
sons
of
the
great
landed
proprietor
if
they
are
few
in
number
or
if
fortune
befriend
them
may
indeed
entertain
the
hope
of
being
as
wealthy
as
their
father
but
not
that
of
possessing
the
same
property
as
he
did
their
riches
must
necessarily
be
composed
of
elements
different
from
his
now
from
the
moment
when
you
divest
the
of
that
interest
in
the
preservation
of
his
estate
which
he
derives
from
association
from
tradition
and
from
family
pride
you
may
be
certain
that
sooner
or
later
he
will
dispose
of
it
for
there
is
a
strong
pecuniary
interest
in
favor
of
selling
as
floating
capital
produces
higher
interest
than
real
property
and
is
more
readily
available
to
gratify
the
passions
of
the
moment
great
landed
estates
which
have
once
been
divided
never
come
together
again
for
the
small
proprietor
draws
from
his
land
a
better
revenue
in
proportion
than
the
large
owner
does
from
his
and
of
course
he
sells
it
at
a
higher
rate
the
calculations
of
gain
therefore
which
decided
the
rich
man
to
sell
his
domain
will
still
more
powerfully
influence
him
against
buying
small
estates
to
unite
them
into
a
large
one
what
is
called
family
pride
is
often
founded
upon
an
illusion
of
a
man
wishes
to
perpetuate
and
immortalize
himself
as
it
were
in
his
where
the
de
ceases
to
act
individual
selfishness
comes
into
play
when
the
idea
of
family
becomes
vague
indeterminate
and
uncertain
a
man
thinks
of
his
present
convenience
he
provides
for
the
establishment
of
the
succeeding
generation
and
no
more
either
a
man
gives
up
the
idea
of
perpetuating
his
family
or
at
any
rate
he
seeks
to
accomplish
it
by
other
means
than
that
of
a
landed
estate
thus
not
only
does
the
law
of
partible
inheritance
render
it
difficult
for
families
to
preserve
their
ancestral
domains
entire
but
it
deprives
them
of
the
inclination
to
attempt
it
and
compels
them
in
some
measure
to
with
the
law
in
their
own
extinction
the
law
of
equal
distribution
proceeds
by
two
methods
by
acting
upon
things
it
acts
upon
persons
by
influencing
persons
it
affects
things
by
these
means
the
law
succeeds
in
striking
at
the
root
of
landed
property
and
dispersing
rapidly
both
families
and
fortunes
most
certainly
is
it
not
for
us
frenchmen
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
daily
behold
the
political
and
social
changes
which
the
law
of
partition
is
bringing
to
pass
to
question
its
influence
it
is
perpetually
conspicuous
in
our
country
overthrowing
the
walls
of
our
dwellings
and
removing
the
landmarks
of
our
fields
but
although
it
has
produced
great
effects
in
france
much
still
remains
for
it
to
do
our
recollections
opinions
and
habits
present
powerful
obstacles
to
its
progress
in
the
united
states
it
has
nearly
completed
its
work
of
destruction
and
there
we
can
best
study
its
results
the
english
laws
concerning
the
transmission
of
property
were
abolished
in
almost
all
the
states
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
the
law
of
entail
was
so
modified
as
not
to
interrupt
the
free
circulation
of
property
the
first
having
passed
away
estates
began
to
be
parcelled
out
and
the
change
became
more
and
more
rapid
with
the
progress
of
time
at
this
moment
after
a
lapse
of
little
more
than
sixty
years
the
aspect
of
society
is
totally
altered
the
families
of
the
great
landed
proprietors
are
almost
all
commingled
with
the
general
mass
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
formerly
contained
many
of
these
there
are
but
two
who
still
keep
their
heads
above
the
stream
and
they
must
shortly
disappear
the
sons
of
these
opulent
citizens
have
become
merchants
lawyers
or
physicians
most
of
them
have
lapsed
into
obscurity
the
last
trace
of
hereditary
ranks
and
distinctions
is
destroyed
the
law
of
partition
has
reduced
all
to
one
level
i
do
not
mean
that
there
is
any
deficiency
of
wealthy
individuals
in
the
united
states
i
know
of
no
country
indeed
where
the
love
of
money
has
taken
stronger
hold
on
the
affections
of
men
and
where
a
profounder
contempt
is
expressed
for
the
theory
of
the
permanent
equality
of
property
but
wealth
circulates
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
experience
shows
that
it
is
rare
to
find
two
succeeding
generations
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
it
this
picture
which
may
perhaps
be
thought
overcharged
still
gives
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
what
is
taking
place
in
the
new
states
of
the
west
and
southwest
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
a
few
bold
adventurers
began
to
penetrate
into
the
valleys
of
the
mississippi
and
the
mass
of
the
population
very
soon
began
to
move
in
that
direction
communities
unheard
of
till
then
were
seen
to
emerge
from
their
wilds
states
whose
names
were
not
in
existence
a
few
years
before
claimed
their
place
in
the
american
union
and
in
the
western
settlements
we
may
behold
democracy
arrived
at
its
utmost
extreme
in
these
states
founded
off
hand
and
as
it
were
by
chance
the
inhabitants
are
but
of
yesterday
scarcely
known
to
one
another
the
nearest
neighbors
are
ignorant
of
each
other
history
in
this
part
of
the
american
continent
therefore
the
population
has
not
experienced
the
influence
of
great
names
and
great
wealth
nor
even
that
of
the
natural
aristocracy
of
knowledge
and
virtue
none
are
there
to
wield
that
respectable
power
which
men
willingly
grant
to
the
remembrance
of
a
life
spent
in
doing
good
before
their
eyes
the
new
states
of
the
west
are
already
inhabited
but
society
has
no
existence
among
them
it
is
not
only
the
fortunes
of
men
which
are
equal
in
america
even
their
acquirements
partake
in
some
degree
of
the
same
uniformity
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
country
in
the
world
where
in
proportion
to
the
population
there
are
so
few
uninstructed
and
at
the
same
time
so
few
learned
individuals
primary
instruction
is
within
the
reach
of
everybody
superior
instruction
is
scarcely
to
be
obtained
by
any
this
is
not
surprising
it
is
in
fact
the
necessary
consequence
of
what
we
have
advanced
above
almost
all
the
americans
are
in
easy
circumstances
and
can
therefore
obtain
the
elements
of
human
knowledge
in
america
there
are
comparatively
few
who
are
rich
enough
to
live
without
a
profession
every
profession
requires
an
apprenticeship
which
limits
the
time
of
instruction
to
the
early
years
of
life
at
fifteen
they
enter
upon
their
calling
and
thus
their
education
ends
at
the
age
when
ours
begins
whatever
is
done
afterward
is
with
a
view
to
some
special
and
lucrative
object
a
science
is
taken
up
as
a
matter
of
business
and
the
only
branch
of
it
which
is
attended
to
is
such
as
admits
of
an
immediate
practical
application
this
paragraph
does
not
fairly
render
the
meaning
of
the
author
the
original
french
is
as
follows
en
amérique
il
y
a
peu
de
riches
presque
tous
les
américains
ont
donc
besoin
une
profession
or
toute

les

à

ans
ils
entrent
dans
une

ainsi
leur
education
finit
le
plus
souvent
à
où
la
nôtre
commence
what
is
meant
by
the
remark
that
at
fifteen
they
enter
upon
a
career
and
thus
their
education
is
very
often
finished
at
the
epoch
when
ours
commences
is
not
clearly
perceived
our
professional
men
enter
upon
their
course
of
preparation
for
their
respective
professions
wholly
between
eighteen
and
years
of
age
apprentices
to
trades
are
bound
out
ordinarily
at
fourteen
but
what
general
education
they
receive
is
after
that
period
previously
they
have
acquired
the
mere
elements
of
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
but
it
is
supposed
there
is
nothing
peculiar
to
america
in
the
age
at
which
apprenticeship
commences
in
england
they
commence
at
the
same
age
and
it
is
believed
that
the
same
thing
occurs
throughout
europe
it
is
feared
that
the
author
has
not
here
expressed
himself
with
his
usual
clearness
and
in
america
most
of
the
rich
men
were
formerly
poor
most
of
those
who
now
enjoy
leisure
were
absorbed
in
business
during
their
youth
the
consequence
of
which
is
that
when
they
might
have
had
a
taste
for
study
they
had
no
time
for
it
and
when
the
time
is
at
their
disposal
they
have
no
longer
the
inclination
there
is
no
class
then
in
america
in
which
the
taste
for
intellectual
pleasures
is
transmitted
with
hereditary
fortune
and
leisure
and
by
which
the
labors
of
the
intellect
are
held
in
honor
accordingly
there
is
an
equal
want
of
the
desire
and
the
power
of
application
to
these
objects
a
middling
standard
is
fixed
in
america
for
human
knowledge
all
approach
as
near
to
it
as
they
can
some
as
they
rise
others
as
they
descend
of
course
an
immense
multitude
of
persons
are
to
be
found
who
entertain
the
same
number
of
ideas
on
religion
history
science
political
economy
legislation
and
government
the
gifts
of
intellect
proceed
directly
from
god
and
man
can
not
prevent
their
unequal
distribution
but
in
consequence
of
the
state
of
things
which
we
have
here
represented
it
happens
that
although
the
capacities
of
men
are
widely
different
as
the
creator
has
doubtless
intended
they
should
be
they
are
submitted
to
the
same
method
of
treatment
in
america
the
aristocratic
element
has
always
been
feeble
from
its
birth
and
if
at
the
present
day
it
is
not
actually
destroyed
it
is
at
any
rate
so
completely
disabled
that
we
can
scarcely
assign
to
it
any
degree
of
influence
in
the
course
of
affairs
the
democratic
principle
on
the
contrary
has
gained
so
much
strength
by
time
by
events
and
by
legislation
as
to
have
become
not
only
predominant
but
there
is
no
family
or
corporate
authority
and
it
is
rare
to
find
even
the
influence
of
individual
character
enjoy
any
durability
america
then
exhibits
in
her
social
state
a
most
extraordinary
phenomenon
men
are
there
seen
on
a
greater
equality
in
point
of
fortune
and
intellect
or
in
other
words
more
equal
in
their
strength
than
in
any
other
country
of
the
world
or
in
any
age
of
which
history
has
preserved
the
remembrance
political
consequences
of
the
social
condition
of
the
the
political
consequences
of
such
a
social
condition
as
this
are
easily
deducible
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
equality
will
not
eventually
find
its
way
into
the
political
world
as
it
does
everywhere
else
to
conceive
of
men
remaining
for
ever
unequal
upon
one
single
point
yet
equal
on
all
others
is
impossible
they
must
come
in
the
end
to
be
equal
upon
all
now
i
know
of
only
two
methods
of
establishing
equality
in
the
political
world
every
citizen
must
be
put
in
possession
of
his
rights
or
rights
must
be
granted
to
no
one
for
nations
which
have
arrived
at
the
same
stage
of
social
existence
as
the
it
is
therefore
very
difficult
to
discover
a
medium
between
the
sovereignty
of
all
and
the
absolute
power
of
one
man
and
it
would
be
vain
to
deny
that
the
social
condition
which
i
have
been
describing
is
equally
liable
to
each
of
these
consequences
there
is
in
fact
a
manly
and
lawful
passion
for
equality
which
excites
men
to
wish
all
to
be
powerful
and
honored
this
passion
tends
to
elevate
the
humble
to
the
rank
of
the
great
but
there
exists
also
in
the
human
heart
a
depraved
taste
for
equality
which
impels
the
weak
to
attempt
to
lower
the
powerful
to
their
own
level
and
reduces
men
to
prefer
equality
in
slavery
to
inequality
with
freedom
not
that
those
nations
whose
social
condition
is
democratic
naturally
despise
liberty
on
the
contrary
they
have
an
instinctive
love
of
it
but
liberty
is
not
the
chief
and
constant
object
of
their
desires
equality
is
their
idol
they
make
rapid
and
sudden
efforts
to
obtain
liberty
and
if
they
miss
their
aim
resign
themselves
to
their
disappointment
but
nothing
can
satisfy
them
except
equality
and
rather
than
lose
it
they
resolve
to
perish
on
the
other
hand
in
a
state
where
the
citizens
are
nearly
on
an
equality
it
becomes
difficult
for
them
to
preserve
their
independence
against
the
aggression
of
power
no
one
among
them
being
strong
enough
to
engage
singly
in
the
struggle
with
advantage
nothing
but
a
general
combination
can
protect
their
liberty
and
such
a
union
is
not
always
to
be
found
from
the
same
social
position
then
nations
may
derive
one
or
the
other
of
two
great
political
results
these
results
are
extremely
different
from
each
other
but
they
may
both
proceed
from
the
same
cause
the
are
the
first
who
having
been
exposed
to
this
formidable
alternative
have
been
happy
enough
to
escape
the
dominion
of
absolute
power
they
have
been
allowed
by
their
circumstances
their
origin
their
intelligence
and
especially
by
their
moral
feeling
to
establish
and
maintain
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
notes
i
understand
by
the
law
of
descent
all
those
laws
whose
principal
object
it
is
to
regulate
the
distribution
of
property
after
the
death
of
its
owner
the
law
of
entail
is
of
this
number
it
certainly
prevents
the
owner
from
disposing
of
his
possessions
before
his
death
but
this
is
solely
with
a
view
of
preserving
them
entire
for
the
heir
the
principal
object
therefore
of
the
law
of
entail
is
to
regulate
the
descent
of
property
after
the
death
of
its
owner
its
other
provisions
are
merely
means
to
this
end
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
small
proprietor
cultivates
his
land
better
but
he
cultivates
it
with
more
ardor
and
care
so
that
he
makes
up
by
his
labor
for
his
want
of
skill
land
being
the
most
stable
kind
of
property
we
find
from
time
to
time
rich
individuals
who
are
disposed
to
make
great
sacrifices
in
order
to
obtain
it
and
who
willingly
forfeit
a
considerable
part
of
their
income
to
make
sure
of
the
rest
but
these
are
accidental
cases
the
preference
for
landed
property
is
no
longer
found
habitually
in
any
class
but
among
the
poor
the
small
who
has
less
information
less
imagination
and
fewer
passions
than
the
great
one
is
generally
occupied
with
the
desire
of
increasing
his
estate
and
it
often
happens
that
by
inheritance
by
marriage
or
by
the
chances
of
trade
he
is
gradually
furnished
with
the
means
thus
to
balance
the
tendency
which
leads
men
to
divide
their
estates
there
exists
another
which
incites
them
to
add
to
them
this
tendency
which
is
sufficient
to
prevent
estates
from
being
divided
is
not
strong
enough
to
create
great
territorial
possessions
certainly
not
to
keep
them
up
in
the
same
family
see
appendix
chapter
iv
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
in
america
it
predominates
over
the
whole
of
society
in
application
made
of
this
principle
by
the
americans
even
before
their
development
given
to
it
by
that
gradual
and
irresistible
extension
of
the
elective
qualification
whenever
the
political
laws
of
the
united
states
are
to
be
discussed
it
is
with
the
doctrine
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
that
we
must
begin
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
which
is
to
be
found
more
or
less
at
the
bottom
of
almost
all
human
institutions
generally
remains
concealed
from
view
it
is
obeyed
without
being
recognised
or
if
for
a
moment
it
be
brought
to
light
it
is
hastily
cast
back
into
the
gloom
of
the
sanctuary
the
will
of
the
nation
is
one
of
those
expressions
which
have
been
most
profusely
abused
by
the
wily
and
the
despotic
of
every
age
to
the
eyes
of
some
it
has
been
represented
by
the
venal
suffrages
of
a
few
of
the
satellites
of
power
to
others
by
the
votes
of
a
timid
minority
and
some
have
even
discovered
it
in
the
silence
of
a
people
on
the
supposition
that
the
fact
of
submission
established
the
right
of
command
in
america
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
is
not
either
barren
or
concealed
as
it
is
with
some
other
nations
it
is
recognised
by
the
customs
and
proclaimed
by
the
laws
it
spreads
freely
and
arrives
without
impediment
at
its
most
remote
consequences
if
there
be
a
country
in
the
world
where
the
doctrine
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
can
be
fairly
appreciated
where
it
can
be
studied
in
its
application
to
the
affairs
of
society
and
where
its
dangers
and
its
advantages
may
be
foreseen
that
country
is
assuredly
america
i
have
already
observed
that
from
their
origin
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
was
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
greater
number
of
the
british
colonies
in
america
it
was
far
however
from
then
exercising
as
much
influence
on
the
government
of
society
as
it
now
does
two
obstacles
the
one
external
the
other
internal
checked
its
invasive
progress
it
could
not
ostensibly
disclose
itself
in
the
laws
of
the
colonies
which
were
still
constrained
to
obey
the
mother
country
it
was
therefore
obliged
to
spread
secretly
and
to
gain
ground
in
the
provincial
assemblies
and
especially
in
the
townships
american
society
was
not
yet
prepared
to
adopt
it
with
all
its
consequences
the
intelligence
of
new
england
and
the
wealth
of
the
country
to
the
south
of
the
hudson
as
i
have
shown
in
the
preceding
chapter
long
exercised
a
sort
of
aristocratic
influence
which
tended
to
limit
the
exercise
of
social
authority
within
the
hands
of
a
few
the
public
functionaries
were
not
universally
elected
and
the
citizens
were
not
all
of
them
electors
the
electoral
franchise
was
everywhere
placed
within
certain
limits
and
made
dependant
on
a
certain
qualification
which
was
exceedingly
low
in
the
north
and
more
considerable
in
the
south
the
american
revolution
broke
out
and
the
doctrine
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
which
had
been
nurtured
in
the
townships
took
possession
of
the
state
every
class
was
enlisted
in
its
cause
battles
were
fought
and
victories
obtained
for
it
until
it
became
the
law
of
laws
a
scarcely
less
rapid
change
was
effected
in
the
interior
of
society
where
the
law
of
descent
completed
the
abolition
of
local
influences
at
the
very
time
when
this
consequence
of
the
laws
and
of
the
revolution
became
apparent
to
every
eye
victory
was
irrevocably
pronounced
in
favor
of
the
democratic
cause
all
power
was
in
fact
in
its
hands
and
resistance
was
no
longer
possible
the
higher
orders
submitted
without
a
murmur
and
without
a
struggle
to
an
evil
which
was
thenceforth
inevitable
the
ordinary
fate
of
falling
powers
awaited
them
each
of
their
several
members
followed
his
own
interest
and
as
it
was
impossible
to
wring
the
power
from
the
hands
of
a
people
which
they
did
not
detest
sufficiently
to
brave
their
only
aim
was
to
secure
its
at
any
price
the
most
democratic
laws
were
consequently
voted
by
the
very
men
whose
interests
they
impaired
and
thus
although
the
higher
classes
did
not
excite
the
passions
of
the
people
against
their
order
they
accelerated
the
triumph
of
the
new
state
of
things
so
that
by
a
singular
change
the
democratic
impulse
was
found
to
be
most
irresistible
in
the
very
states
where
the
aristocracy
had
the
firmest
hold
the
state
of
maryland
which
had
been
founded
by
men
of
rank
was
the
first
to
proclaim
universal
suffrage
and
to
introduce
the
most
democratic
forms
into
the
conduct
of
its
government
when
a
nation
modifies
the
elective
qualification
it
may
easily
be
foreseen
that
sooner
or
later
that
qualification
will
be
entirely
abolished
there
is
no
more
invariable
rule
in
the
history
of
society
the
farther
electoral
rights
are
extended
the
more
is
felt
the
need
of
extending
them
for
after
each
concession
the
strength
of
the
democracy
increases
and
its
demands
increase
with
its
strength
the
ambition
of
those
who
are
below
the
appointed
rate
is
irritated
in
exact
proportion
to
the
great
number
of
those
who
are
above
it
the
exception
at
last
becomes
the
rule
concession
follows
concession
and
no
stop
can
be
made
short
of
universal
suffrage
at
the
present
day
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
has
acquired
in
the
united
states
all
the
practical
development
which
the
imagination
can
conceive
it
is
unencumbered
by
those
fictions
which
have
been
thrown
over
it
in
other
countries
and
it
appears
in
every
possible
form
according
to
the
exigency
of
the
occasion
sometimes
the
laws
are
made
by
the
people
in
a
body
as
at
athens
and
sometimes
its
representatives
chosen
by
universal
suffrage
transact
business
in
its
name
and
almost
under
its
immediate
control
in
some
countries
a
power
exists
which
though
it
is
in
a
degree
foreign
to
the
social
body
directs
it
and
forces
it
to
pursue
a
certain
track
in
others
the
ruling
force
is
divided
being
partly
within
and
partly
without
the
ranks
of
the
people
but
nothing
of
the
kind
is
to
be
seen
in
the
united
states
there
society
governs
itself
for
itself
all
power
centres
in
its
bosom
and
scarcely
an
individual
is
to
be
met
with
who
would
venture
to
conceive
or
still
more
to
express
the
idea
of
seeking
it
elsewhere
the
nation
participates
in
the
making
of
its
laws
by
the
choice
of
its
legislators
and
in
the
execution
of
them
by
the
choice
of
the
agents
of
the
executive
government
it
may
almost
be
said
to
govern
itself
so
feeble
and
so
restricted
is
the
share
left
to
the
administration
so
little
do
the
authorities
forget
their
popular
origin
and
the
power
from
which
they
emanate

necessity
of
examining
the
condition
of
the
states
before
that
of
the
union
at
large
it
is
proposed
to
examine
in
the
following
chapter
what
is
the
form
of
government
established
in
america
on
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
what
are
its
resources
its
hindrances
its
advantages
and
its
dangers
the
first
difficulty
which
presents
itself
arises
from
the
complex
nature
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
consists
of
two
distinct
social
structures
connected
and
as
it
were
encased
one
within
the
other
two
governments
completely
separate
and
almost
independent
the
one
fulfilling
the
ordinary
duties
and
responding
to
the
daily
and
indefinite
calls
of
a
community
the
other
circumscribed
within
certain
limits
and
only
exercising
an
exceptional
authority
over
the
general
interests
of
the
country
in
short
there
are
small
sovereign
nations
whose
agglomeration
constitutes
the
body
of
the
union
to
examine
the
union
before
we
have
studied
the
states
would
be
to
adopt
a
method
filled
with
obstacles
the
federal
government
of
the
united
states
was
the
last
which
was
adopted
and
it
is
in
fact
nothing
more
than
a
modification
or
a
summary
of
these
republican
principles
which
were
current
in
the
whole
community
before
it
existed
and
independently
of
its
existence
moreover
the
federal
government
is
as
i
have
just
observed
the
exception
the
government
of
the
states
is
the
rule
the
author
who
should
attempt
to
exhibit
the
picture
as
a
whole
before
he
had
explained
its
details
would
necessarily
fall
into
obscurity
and
repetition
the
great
political
principles
which
govern
american
society
at
this
day
undoubtedly
took
their
origin
and
their
growth
in
the
state
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
become
acquainted
with
the
state
in
order
to
possess
a
clew
to
the
remainder
the
states
which
at
present
compose
the
american
union
all
present
the
same
features
as
far
as
regards
the
external
aspect
of
their
institutions
their
political
or
administrative
existence
is
centred
in
three
foci
of
action
which
may
not
inaptly
be
compared
to
the
different
nervous
centres
which
convey
motion
to
the
human
body
the
township
is
in
the
lowest
order
then
the
county
and
lastly
the
state
and
i
propose
to
devote
the
following
chapter
to
the
examination
of
these
three
divisions
the
american
system
of
townships
and
municipal
bodies
why
the
author
begins
the
examination
of
the
political
institutions
with
the
its
existence
in
all
difficulty
of
establishing
and
preserving
its
why
the
author
has
selected
the
township
system
of
new
england
as
the
main
object
of
his
inquiry
it
is
not
undesignedly
that
i
begin
this
subject
with
the
township
the
village
or
township
is
the
only
association
which
is
so
perfectly
natural
that
wherever
a
number
of
men
are
collected
it
seems
to
constitute
itself
the
town
or
tithing
as
the
smallest
division
of
a
community
must
necessarily
exist
in
all
nations
whatever
their
laws
and
customs
may
be
if
man
makes
monarchies
and
establishes
republics
the
first
association
of
mankind
seems
constituted
by
the
hand
of
god
but
although
the
existence
of
the
township
is
coeval
with
that
of
man
its
liberties
are
not
the
less
rarely
respected
and
easily
destroyed
a
nation
is
always
able
to
establish
great
political
assemblies
because
it
habitually
contains
a
certain
number
of
individuals
fitted
by
their
talents
if
not
by
their
habits
for
the
direction
of
affairs
the
township
is
on
the
contrary
composed
of
coarser
materials
which
are
less
easily
fashioned
by
the
legislator
the
difficulties
which
attend
the
consolidation
of
its
independence
rather
augment
than
diminish
with
the
increasing
enlightenment
of
the
people
a
community
spurns
the
attempts
of
a
local
independence
is
disgusted
at
its
numerous
blunders
and
is
apt
to
despair
of
success
before
the
experiment
is
completed
again
no
immunities
are
so
from
the
encroachments
of
the
supreme
power
as
those
of
municipal
bodies
in
general
they
are
unable
to
struggle
against
a
strong
or
an
enterprising
government
and
they
can
not
defend
their
cause
with
success
unless
it
be
identified
with
the
customs
of
the
nation
and
supported
by
public
opinion
thus
until
the
independence
of
townships
is
amalgamated
with
the
manners
of
a
people
it
is
easily
destroyed
and
it
is
only
after
a
long
existence
in
the
laws
that
it
can
be
thus
amalgamated
municipal
freedom
eludes
the
exertions
of
man
it
is
rarely
created
but
it
is
as
it
were
secretly
and
spontaneously
engendered
in
the
midst
of
a
state
of
society
the
constant
action
of
the
laws
and
the
national
habits
peculiar
circumstances
and
above
all
time
may
consolidate
it
but
there
is
certainly
no
nation
on
the
continent
of
europe
which
has
experienced
its
advantages
nevertheless
local
assemblies
of
citizens
constitute
the
strength
of
free
nations
municipal
institutions
are
to
liberty
what
primary
schools
are
to
science
they
bring
it
within
the
people
reach
they
teach
men
how
to
use
and
how
to
enjoy
it
a
nation
may
establish
a
system
of
free
government
but
without
the
spirit
of
municipal
institutions
it
can
not
have
the
spirit
of
liberty
the
transient
passions
and
the
interests
of
an
hour
or
the
chance
of
circumstances
may
have
created
the
external
forms
of
independence
but
the
despotic
tendency
which
has
been
repelled
will
sooner
or
later
inevitably
reappear
on
the
surface
in
order
to
explain
to
the
reader
the
general
principles
on
which
the
political
organisations
of
the
counties
and
townships
of
the
united
states
rest
i
have
thought
it
expedient
to
choose
one
of
the
states
of
new
england
as
an
example
to
examine
the
mechanism
of
its
constitution
and
then
to
cast
a
general
glance
over
the
country
the
township
and
the
county
are
not
organized
in
the
same
manner
in
every
part
of
the
union
it
is
however
easy
to
perceive
that
the
same
principles
have
guided
the
formation
of
both
of
them
throughout
the
union
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
these
principles
have
been
carried
farther
in
new
england
than
elsewhere
and
consequently
that
they
offer
greater
facilities
to
the
observations
of
a
stranger
the
institutions
of
new
england
form
a
complete
and
regular
whole
they
have
received
the
sanction
of
time
they
have
the
support
of
the
laws
and
the
still
stronger
support
of
the
manners
of
the
community
over
which
they
exercise
the
most
prodigious
influence
they
consequently
deserve
our
attention
on
every
account
limits
of
the
township
the
township
of
new
england
is
a
division
which
stands
between
the
commune
and
the
canton
of
france
and
which
corresponds
in
general
to
the
english
tithing
or
town
its
average
population
is
from
two
to
three
thousand
so
that
on
the
one
hand
the
interests
of
the
inhabitants
are
not
likely
to
conflict
and
on
the
other
men
capable
of
conducting
its
affairs
are
always
to
be
found
among
its
citizens
authorities
of
the
township
in
new
england
the
people
the
source
of
all
power
here
as
manages
its
own
affairs
no
the
greater
part
of
the
authority
vested
in
the
hands
of
the
how
the
selectmen
enumeration
of
the
public
officers
of
the
township
obligatory
and
remunerated
functions
in
the
township
as
well
as
everywhere
else
the
people
is
the
only
source
of
power
but
in
no
stage
of
government
does
the
body
of
citizens
exercise
a
more
immediate
influence
in
america
the
people
is
a
master
whose
exigences
demand
obedience
to
the
utmost
limits
of
possibility
in
new
england
the
majority
acts
by
representatives
in
the
conduct
of
the
public
business
of
the
state
but
if
such
an
arrangement
be
necessary
in
general
affairs
in
the
township
where
the
legislative
and
administrative
action
of
the
government
is
in
more
immediate
contact
with
the
subject
the
system
of
representation
is
not
adopted
there
is
no
corporation
but
the
body
of
electors
after
having
designated
its
magistrates
directs
them
in
anything
that
exceeds
the
simple
and
ordinary
executive
business
of
the
state
this
state
of
things
is
so
contrary
to
our
ideas
and
so
different
from
our
customs
that
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
adduce
some
examples
to
explain
it
thoroughly
the
public
duties
in
the
township
are
extremely
numerous
and
minutely
divided
as
we
shall
see
farther
on
but
the
large
proportion
of
administrative
power
is
vested
in
the
hands
of
a
small
number
of
individuals
called
the
selectmen
the
general
laws
of
the
state
impose
a
certain
number
of
obligations
on
the
selectmen
which
may
they
fulfil
without
the
authorization
of
the
body
they
govern
but
which
they
can
only
neglect
on
their
own
responsibility
the
law
of
the
state
obliges
them
for
instance
to
draw
up
the
list
of
electors
in
the
townships
and
if
they
omit
this
part
of
their
functions
they
are
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
in
all
the
affairs
however
which
are
determined
by
the
the
selectmen
are
the
organs
of
the
popular
mandate
as
in
france
the
maire
executes
the
decree
of
the
municipal
council
they
usually
act
upon
their
own
responsibility
and
merely
put
in
practice
principles
which
have
been
previously
recognised
by
the
majority
but
if
any
change
is
to
be
introduced
in
the
existing
state
of
things
or
if
they
wish
to
undertake
any
new
enterprise
they
are
obliged
to
refer
to
the
source
of
their
power
if
for
instance
a
school
is
to
be
established
the
selectmen
convoke
the
whole
body
of
electors
on
a
certain
day
at
an
appointed
place
they
explain
the
urgency
of
the
case
they
give
their
opinion
on
the
means
of
satisfying
it
on
the
probable
expense
and
the
site
which
seems
to
be
most
favorable
the
meeting
is
consulted
on
these
several
points
it
adopts
the
principle
marks
out
the
site
votes
the
rate
and
confides
the
execution
of
its
resolution
to
the
selectmen
the
selectmen
alone
have
the
right
of
calling
a
but
they
may
be
requested
to
do
so
if
the
citizens
are
desirous
of
submitting
a
new
project
to
the
assent
of
the
township
they
may
demand
a
general
convocation
of
the
inhabitants
the
selectmen
are
obliged
to
comply
but
they
have
only
the
right
of
presiding
at
the
meeting
the
selectmen
are
elected
every
year
in
the
month
of
april
or
of
may
the
chooses
at
the
same
time
a
number
of
municipal
magistrates
who
are
intrusted
with
important
administrative
functions
the
assessors
rate
the
township
the
collectors
receive
the
rate
a
constable
is
appointed
to
keep
the
peace
to
watch
the
streets
and
to
forward
the
execution
of
the
laws
the
records
all
the
town
votes
orders
grants
births
deaths
and
marriages
the
treasurer
keeps
the
funds
the
overseer
of
the
poor
performs
the
difficult
task
of
superintending
the
action
of
the
poor
laws
are
appointed
to
attend
to
the
schools
and
to
public
instruction
and
the
who
take
care
of
the
greater
and
lesser
thoroughfares
of
the
township
complete
the
list
of
the
principal
functionaries
they
are
however
still
farther
subdivided
and
among
the
municipal
officers
are
to
be
found
parish
commissioners
who
audit
the
expenses
of
public
worship
different
classes
of
inspectors
some
of
whom
are
to
direct
the
citizens
in
case
of
fire
listers
haywards
to
maintain
the
bounds
of
property
and
sealers
of
weights
and
measures
there
are
nineteen
principal
offices
in
a
township
every
inhabitant
is
constrained
on
pain
of
being
fined
to
undertake
these
different
functions
which
however
are
almost
all
paid
in
order
that
the
poor
citizens
may
be
able
to
give
up
their
time
without
loss
in
general
the
american
system
is
not
to
grant
a
fixed
salary
to
its
functionaries
every
service
has
its
price
and
they
are
remunerated
in
proportion
to
what
they
have
done
existence
of
the
township
every
one
the
best
judge
of
his
own
corollary
of
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
application
of
these
doctrines
in
the
townships
of
the
township
of
new
england
is
sovereign
in
that
which
concerns
itself
alone
subject
to
the
state
in
all
other
bond
of
township
and
the
in
france
the
government
lends
its
agents
to
the
in
america
the
reverse
occurs
i
have
already
observed
that
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
governs
the
whole
political
system
of
the
every
page
of
this
book
will
afford
new
instances
of
the
same
doctrine
in
the
nations
by
which
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
is
recognised
every
individual
possesses
an
equal
share
of
power
and
participates
alike
in
the
government
of
the
state
every
individual
is
therefore
supposed
to
be
as
well
informed
as
virtuous
and
as
strong
as
any
of
his
he
obeys
the
government
not
because
he
is
inferior
to
the
authorities
which
conduct
it
or
that
he
is
less
capable
than
his
neighbor
of
governing
himself
but
because
he
acknowledges
the
utility
of
an
association
with
his
and
because
he
knows
that
no
such
association
can
exist
without
a
regulating
force
if
he
be
a
subject
in
all
that
concerns
the
mutual
relations
of
citizens
he
is
free
and
responsible
to
god
alone
for
all
that
concerns
himself
hence
arises
the
maxim
that
every
one
is
the
best
and
the
sole
judge
of
his
own
private
interest
and
that
society
has
no
right
to
control
a
man
actions
unless
they
are
prejudicial
to
the
common
weal
or
unless
the
common
weal
demands
his
this
doctrine
is
universally
admitted
in
the
united
states
i
shall
hereafter
examine
the
general
influence
which
it
exercises
on
the
ordinary
actions
of
life
i
am
now
speaking
of
the
nature
of
municipal
bodies
the
township
taken
as
a
whole
and
in
relation
to
the
government
of
the
country
may
be
looked
upon
as
an
individual
to
whom
the
theory
i
have
just
alluded
to
is
applied
municipal
independence
is
therefore
a
natural
consequence
of
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
in
the
united
states
all
the
american
republics
recognise
it
more
or
less
but
circumstances
have
peculiarly
favored
its
growth
in
new
england
in
this
part
of
the
union
the
impulsion
of
political
activity
was
given
in
the
townships
and
it
may
almost
be
said
that
each
of
them
originally
formed
an
independent
nation
when
the
kings
of
england
asserted
their
supremacy
they
were
contented
to
assume
the
central
power
of
the
state
the
townships
of
new
england
remained
as
they
were
before
and
although
they
are
now
subject
to
the
state
they
were
at
first
scarcely
dependent
upon
it
it
is
important
to
remember
that
they
have
not
been
invested
with
privileges
but
that
they
seem
on
the
contrary
to
have
surrendered
a
portion
of
their
independence
to
the
state
the
townships
are
only
subordinate
to
the
state
in
those
interests
which
i
shall
term
as
they
are
common
to
all
the
citizens
they
are
independent
in
all
that
concerns
themselves
and
among
the
inhabitants
of
new
england
i
believe
that
not
a
man
is
to
be
found
who
would
acknowledge
that
the
state
has
any
right
to
interfere
in
their
local
interests
the
towns
of
new
england
buy
and
sell
prosecute
or
are
indicted
augment
or
diminish
their
rates
without
the
slightest
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
administrative
authority
of
the
state
they
are
bound
however
to
comply
with
the
demands
of
the
community
if
the
state
is
in
need
of
money
a
town
can
neither
give
nor
withhold
the
supplies
if
the
state
projects
a
road
the
township
can
not
refuse
to
let
it
cross
its
territory
if
a
police
regulation
is
made
by
the
state
it
must
be
enforced
by
the
town
a
uniform
system
of
instruction
is
organised
all
over
the
country
and
every
town
is
bound
to
establish
the
schools
which
the
law
ordains
in
speaking
of
the
administration
of
the
united
states
i
shall
have
occasion
to
point
out
the
means
by
which
the
townships
are
compelled
to
obey
in
these
different
cases
i
here
merely
show
the
existence
of
the
obligation
strict
as
this
obligation
is
the
government
of
the
state
imposes
it
in
principle
only
and
in
its
performance
the
township
resumes
all
its
independent
rights
thus
taxes
are
voted
by
the
state
but
they
are
assessed
and
collected
by
the
township
the
existence
of
a
school
is
obligatory
but
the
township
builds
pays
and
superintends
it
in
france
the
state
collector
receives
the
local
imposts
in
america
the
town
collector
receives
the
taxes
of
the
state
thus
the
french
government
lends
its
agents
to
the
commune
in
america
the
township
is
the
agent
of
the
government
this
fact
alone
shows
the
extent
of
the
differences
which
exist
between
the
two
nations
public
spirit
of
the
townships
of
new
england
how
the
township
of
new
england
wins
the
affections
of
its
difficulty
of
creating
local
public
spirit
in
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
american
township
favorable
to
characteristics
of
home
in
the
united
manifestations
of
public
spirit
in
new
its
happy
effects
in
america
not
only
do
municipal
bodies
exist
but
they
are
kept
alive
and
supported
by
public
spirit
the
township
of
new
england
possesses
two
advantages
which
infallibly
secure
the
attentive
interest
of
mankind
namely
independence
and
authority
its
sphere
is
indeed
small
and
limited
but
within
that
sphere
its
action
is
unrestrained
and
its
independence
would
give
to
it
a
real
importance
even
if
its
extent
and
population
did
not
ensure
it
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
affections
of
men
are
generally
turned
only
where
there
is
strength
patriotism
is
not
durable
in
a
conquered
nation
the
new
englander
is
attached
to
his
township
not
only
because
he
was
born
in
it
but
because
it
constitutes
a
strong
and
free
social
body
of
which
he
is
a
member
and
whose
government
claims
and
deserves
the
exercise
of
his
sagacity
in
europe
the
absence
of
local
public
spirit
is
a
frequent
subject
of
regret
to
those
who
are
in
power
every
one
agrees
that
there
is
no
surer
guarantee
of
order
and
tranquillity
and
yet
nothing
is
more
difficult
to
create
if
the
municipal
bodies
were
made
powerful
and
independent
the
authorities
of
the
nation
might
be
disunited
and
the
peace
of
the
country
endangered
yet
without
power
and
independence
a
town
may
contain
good
subjects
but
it
can
have
no
active
citizens
another
important
fact
is
that
the
township
of
new
england
is
so
constituted
as
to
excite
the
warmest
of
human
affections
without
arousing
the
ambitious
passions
of
the
heart
of
man
the
officers
of
the
county
are
not
elected
and
their
authority
is
very
limited
even
the
state
is
only
a
community
whose
tranquil
and
obscure
administration
offers
no
inducement
sufficient
to
draw
men
away
from
the
circle
of
their
interests
into
the
turmoil
of
public
affairs
the
federal
government
confers
power
and
honor
on
the
men
who
conduct
it
but
these
individuals
can
never
be
very
numerous
the
high
station
of
the
presidency
can
only
be
reached
at
an
advanced
period
of
life
and
the
other
federal
functionaries
are
generally
men
who
have
been
favored
by
fortune
or
distinguished
in
some
other
career
such
can
not
be
the
permanent
aim
of
the
ambitious
but
the
township
serves
as
a
centre
for
the
desire
of
public
esteem
the
want
of
exciting
interests
and
the
taste
for
authority
and
popularity
in
the
midst
of
the
ordinary
relations
of
life
and
the
passions
which
commonly
embroil
society
change
their
character
when
they
find
a
vent
so
near
the
domestic
hearth
and
the
family
circle
in
the
american
states
power
has
been
disseminated
with
admirable
skill
for
the
purpose
of
interesting
the
greatest
possible
number
of
persons
in
the
common
weal
independently
of
the
electors
who
are
from
time
to
time
called
into
action
the
body
politic
is
divided
into
innumerable
functionaries
and
officers
who
all
in
their
several
spheres
represent
the
same
powerful
corporation
in
whose
name
they
act
the
local
administration
thus
affords
an
unfailing
source
of
profit
and
interest
to
a
vast
number
of
individuals
the
american
system
which
divides
the
local
authority
among
so
many
citizens
does
not
scruple
to
multiply
the
functions
of
the
town
officers
for
in
the
united
states
it
is
believed
and
with
truth
that
patriotism
is
a
kind
of
devotion
which
is
strengthened
by
ritual
observance
in
this
manner
the
activity
of
the
township
is
continually
perceptible
it
is
daily
manifested
in
the
fulfilment
of
a
duty
or
the
exercise
of
a
right
and
a
constant
though
gentle
motion
is
thus
kept
up
in
society
which
animates
without
disturbing
it
the
american
attaches
himself
to
his
home
as
the
mountaineer
clings
to
his
hills
because
the
characteristic
features
of
his
country
are
there
more
distinctly
marked
than
elsewhere
the
existence
of
the
townships
of
new
england
is
in
general
a
happy
one
their
government
is
suited
to
their
tastes
and
chosen
by
themselves
in
the
midst
of
the
profound
peace
and
general
comfort
which
reign
in
america
the
commotions
of
municipal
discord
are
infrequent
the
conduct
of
local
business
is
easy
the
political
education
of
the
people
has
long
been
complete
say
rather
that
it
was
complete
when
the
people
first
set
foot
upon
the
soil
in
new
england
no
tradition
exists
of
a
distinction
of
ranks
no
portion
of
the
community
is
tempted
to
oppress
the
remainder
and
the
abuses
which
may
injure
isolated
individuals
are
forgotten
in
the
general
contentment
which
prevails
if
the
government
is
defective
and
it
would
no
doubt
be
easy
to
point
out
its
deficiencies
the
fact
that
it
really
emanates
from
those
it
governs
and
that
it
acts
either
ill
or
well
casts
the
protecting
spell
of
a
parental
pride
over
its
faults
no
term
of
comparison
disturbs
the
satisfaction
of
the
citizen
england
formerly
governed
the
mass
of
the
colonies
but
the
people
was
always
sovereign
in
the
township
where
its
rule
is
not
only
an
ancient
but
a
primitive
state
the
native
of
new
england
is
attached
to
his
township
because
it
is
independent
and
free
his
in
its
affairs
ensures
his
attachment
to
its
interest
the
it
affords
him
secures
his
affection
and
its
welfare
is
the
aim
of
his
ambition
and
of
his
future
exertions
he
takes
a
part
in
every
occurrence
in
the
place
he
practises
the
art
of
government
in
the
small
sphere
within
his
reach
he
accustoms
himself
to
those
forms
which
can
alone
ensure
the
steady
progress
of
liberty
he
imbibes
their
spirit
he
acquires
a
taste
for
order
comprehends
the
union
of
the
balance
of
powers
and
collects
clear
practical
notions
on
the
nature
of
his
duties
and
the
extent
of
his
rights
the
counties
of
new
england
the
division
of
the
counties
in
america
has
considerable
analogy
with
that
of
the
arrondissements
of
france
the
limits
of
the
counties
are
arbitrarily
laid
down
and
the
various
districts
which
they
contain
have
no
necessary
connexion
no
common
traditional
or
natural
sympathy
their
object
is
simply
to
facilitate
the
administration
of
public
affairs
the
extent
of
the
township
was
too
small
to
contain
a
system
of
judicial
institutions
each
county
has
however
a
court
of
justice
a
sheriff
to
execute
its
decrees
and
a
prison
for
criminals
there
are
certain
wants
which
are
felt
alike
by
all
the
townships
of
a
county
it
is
therefore
natural
that
they
should
be
satisfied
by
a
central
authority
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
this
authority
is
vested
in
the
hands
of
several
magistrates
who
are
appointed
by
the
governor
of
the
state
with
the
advice
of
his
council
the
officers
of
the
county
have
only
a
limited
and
occasional
authority
which
is
applicable
to
certain
predetermined
cases
the
state
and
the
townships
possess
all
the
power
requisite
to
conduct
public
business
the
budget
of
the
county
is
only
drawn
up
by
its
officers
and
is
voted
by
the
legislature
there
is
no
assembly
which
directly
or
indirectly
represents
the
county
it
has
therefore
properly
speaking
no
political
existence
a
twofold
tendency
may
be
discerned
in
the
american
constitutions
which
impels
the
legislator
to
centralize
the
legislative
and
to
disperse
the
executive
power
the
township
of
new
england
has
in
itself
an
indestructible
element
of
independence
but
this
distinct
existence
could
only
be
fictitiously
introduced
into
the
county
where
its
utility
had
not
been
felt
all
the
townships
united
have
but
one
representation
which
is
the
state
the
centre
of
the
national
authority
beyond
the
action
of
the
township
and
that
of
the
nation
nothing
can
be
said
to
exist
but
the
influence
of
individual
exertion
administration
in
new
england
administration
not
perceived
in
why
the
europeans
believe
that
liberty
is
promoted
by
depriving
the
social
authority
of
some
of
its
rights
the
americans
by
dividing
its
almost
all
the
administration
confined
to
the
township
and
divided
among
the
town
no
trace
of
an
administrative
hierarchy
to
be
perceived
either
in
the
township
or
above
the
reason
of
how
it
happens
that
the
administration
of
the
state
is
who
is
empowered
to
enforce
the
obedience
of
the
township
and
the
county
to
the
the
introduction
of
judicial
power
into
the
consequence
of
the
extension
of
the
elective
principle
to
all
the
justice
of
the
peace
in
new
by
whom
county
ensures
the
administration
of
the
court
of
its
right
of
inspection
and
indictment
disseminated
like
the
other
administrative
informers
encouraged
by
the
division
of
fines
nothing
is
more
striking
to
a
european
traveller
in
the
united
states
than
the
absence
of
what
we
term
government
or
the
administration
written
laws
exist
in
america
and
one
sees
that
they
are
daily
executed
but
although
everything
is
in
motion
the
hand
which
gives
the
impulse
to
the
social
machine
can
nowhere
be
discovered
nevertheless
as
all
people
are
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
certain
grammatical
forms
which
are
the
foundation
of
human
language
in
order
to
express
their
thoughts
so
all
communities
are
obliged
to
secure
their
existence
by
submitting
to
a
certain
portion
of
authority
without
which
they
fall
a
prey
to
anarchy
this
authority
may
be
distributed
in
several
ways
but
it
must
always
exist
somewhere
there
are
two
methods
of
diminishing
the
force
of
authority
in
a
nation
the
first
is
to
weaken
the
supreme
power
in
its
very
principle
by
forbidding
or
preventing
society
from
acting
in
its
own
defence
under
certain
circumstances
to
weaken
authority
in
this
manner
is
what
is
generally
termed
in
europe
to
lay
the
foundations
of
freedom
the
second
manner
of
diminishing
the
influence
of
authority
does
not
consist
in
stripping
society
of
any
of
its
rights
nor
in
paralysing
its
efforts
but
in
distributing
the
exercise
of
its
privileges
among
various
hands
and
in
multiplying
functionaries
to
each
of
whom
the
degree
of
power
necessary
for
him
to
perform
his
duty
is
intrusted
there
may
be
nations
whom
this
distribution
of
social
powers
might
lead
to
anarchy
but
in
itself
it
is
not
anarchical
the
action
of
authority
is
indeed
thus
rendered
less
irresistible
and
less
perilous
but
it
is
not
totally
suppressed
the
revolution
of
the
united
states
was
the
result
of
a
mature
and
deliberate
taste
for
freedom
not
of
a
vague
or
craving
for
independence
it
contracted
no
alliance
with
the
turbulent
passions
of
anarchy
but
its
course
was
marked
on
the
contrary
by
an
attachment
to
whatever
was
lawful
and
orderly
it
was
never
assumed
in
the
united
states
that
the
citizen
of
a
free
country
has
a
right
to
do
whatever
he
pleases
on
the
contrary
social
obligations
were
there
imposed
upon
him
more
various
than
anywhere
else
no
idea
was
ever
entertained
of
attacking
the
principles
or
of
contesting
the
rights
of
society
but
the
exercise
of
its
authority
was
divided
to
the
end
that
the
office
might
be
powerful
and
the
officer
insignificant
and
that
the
community
should
be
at
once
regulated
and
free
in
no
country
in
the
world
does
the
law
hold
so
absolute
a
language
as
in
america
and
in
no
country
is
the
right
of
applying
it
vested
in
so
many
hands
the
administrative
power
in
the
united
states
presents
nothing
either
central
or
hierarchical
in
its
constitution
which
accounts
for
its
passing
unperceived
the
power
exists
but
its
representative
is
not
to
be
discerned
we
have
already
seen
that
the
independent
townships
of
new
england
protect
their
own
private
interests
and
the
municipal
magistrates
are
the
persons
to
whom
the
execution
of
the
laws
of
the
state
is
most
frequently
intrusted
beside
the
general
laws
the
state
sometimes
passes
general
police
regulations
but
more
commonly
the
townships
and
town
officers
conjointly
with
the
justices
of
the
peace
regulate
the
minor
details
of
social
life
according
to
the
necessities
of
the
different
localities
and
promulgate
such
enactments
as
concern
the
health
of
the
community
and
the
peace
as
well
as
morality
of
the
citizens
lastly
these
municipal
magistrates
provide
of
their
own
accord
and
without
any
delegated
powers
for
those
unforeseen
emergencies
which
frequently
occur
in
society
it
results
from
what
we
have
said
that
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
the
administrative
authority
is
almost
entirely
restricted
to
the
township
but
that
it
is
distributed
among
a
great
number
of
individuals
in
the
french
commune
there
is
properly
but
one
official
functionary
namely
the
maire
and
in
new
england
we
have
seen
that
there
are
nineteen
these
nineteen
functionaries
do
not
in
general
depend
upon
one
another
the
law
carefully
prescribes
a
circle
of
action
to
each
of
these
magistrates
and
within
that
circle
they
have
an
entire
right
to
perform
their
functions
independently
of
any
other
authority
above
the
township
scarcely
any
trace
of
a
series
of
official
dignities
is
to
be
found
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
county
officers
alter
a
decision
of
the
townships
or
town
magistrates
but
in
general
the
authorities
of
the
county
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
the
authorities
of
the
township
except
in
such
matters
as
concern
the
county
the
magistrates
of
the
township
as
well
as
those
of
the
county
are
bound
to
communicate
their
acts
to
the
central
government
in
a
very
small
number
of
predetermined
cases
but
the
central
government
is
not
represented
by
an
individual
whose
business
it
is
to
publish
police
regulations
and
ordinances
enforcing
the
execution
of
the
laws
to
keep
up
a
regular
communication
with
the
officers
of
the
township
and
the
county
to
inspect
their
conduct
to
direct
their
actions
or
reprimand
their
faults
there
is
no
point
which
serves
as
a
centre
to
the
radii
of
the
administration
what
then
is
the
uniform
plan
on
which
the
government
is
conducted
and
how
is
the
compliance
of
the
counties
and
their
magistrates
or
the
townships
and
their
officers
enforced
in
the
states
of
new
england
the
legislative
authority
embraces
more
subjects
than
it
does
in
france
the
legislator
penetrates
to
the
very
core
of
the
administration
the
law
descends
to
the
most
minute
details
the
same
enactment
prescribes
the
principle
and
the
method
of
its
application
and
thus
imposes
a
multitude
of
strict
and
rigorously
defined
obligations
on
the
secondary
functionaries
of
the
state
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
if
all
the
secondary
functionaries
of
the
administration
conform
to
the
law
society
in
all
its
branches
proceeds
with
the
greatest
uniformity
the
difficulty
remains
of
compelling
the
secondary
functionaries
of
the
administration
to
conform
to
the
law
it
may
be
affirmed
that
in
general
society
has
only
two
methods
of
enforcing
the
execution
of
the
laws
at
its
disposal
a
discretionary
power
may
be
intrusted
to
a
superior
functionary
of
directing
all
the
others
and
of
cashiering
them
in
case
of
disobedience
or
the
courts
of
justice
may
be
authorized
to
inflict
judicial
penalties
on
the
offender
but
these
two
methods
are
not
always
available
the
right
of
directing
a
civil
officer
that
of
cashiering
him
if
he
does
not
obey
orders
and
of
rewarding
him
by
promotion
if
he
fulfils
his
duties
with
propriety
but
an
elected
magistrate
can
neither
be
cashiered
nor
promoted
all
elective
functions
are
inalienable
until
their
term
is
expired
in
fact
the
elected
magistrate
has
nothing
either
to
expect
or
to
fear
from
his
constituents
and
when
all
public
offices
are
filled
by
ballot
there
can
be
no
series
of
official
dignities
because
the
double
right
of
commanding
and
of
enforcing
obedience
can
never
be
vested
in
the
same
individual
and
because
the
power
of
issuing
an
order
can
never
be
joined
to
that
of
inflicting
a
punishment
or
bestowing
a
reward
the
communities
therefore
in
which
the
secondary
functionaries
of
the
government
are
elected
are
perforce
obliged
to
make
great
use
of
judicial
penalties
as
a
means
of
administration
this
is
not
evident
at
first
sight
for
those
in
power
are
apt
to
look
upon
the
institution
of
elective
functionaries
as
one
concession
and
the
subjection
of
the
elective
magistrate
to
the
judges
of
the
land
as
another
they
are
equally
averse
to
both
these
innovations
and
as
they
are
more
pressingly
solicited
to
grant
the
former
than
the
latter
they
accede
to
the
election
of
the
magistrate
and
leave
him
independent
of
the
judicial
power
nevertheless
the
second
of
these
measures
is
the
only
thing
that
can
possibly
the
first
and
it
will
be
found
that
an
elective
authority
which
is
not
subject
to
judicial
power
will
sooner
or
later
either
elude
all
control
or
be
destroyed
the
courts
of
justice
are
the
only
possible
medium
between
the
central
power
and
the
administrative
bodies
they
alone
can
compel
the
elected
functionary
to
obey
without
violating
the
rights
of
the
elector
the
extension
of
judicial
power
in
the
political
world
ought
therefore
to
be
in
the
exact
ratio
of
the
extension
of
elective
offices
if
these
two
institutions
do
not
go
hand
in
hand
the
state
must
fall
into
anarchy
or
into
subjection
it
has
always
been
remarked
that
habits
of
legal
business
do
not
render
men
apt
to
the
exercise
of
administrative
authority
the
americans
have
borrowed
from
the
english
their
fathers
the
idea
of
an
institution
which
is
unknown
upon
the
continent
of
europe
i
allude
to
that
of
justices
of
the
peace
the
justice
of
the
peace
is
a
sort
of
between
the
magistrate
and
the
man
of
the
world
between
the
civil
officer
and
the
judge
a
justice
of
the
peace
is
a
citizen
though
he
is
not
necessarily
versed
in
the
knowledge
of
the
laws
his
office
simply
obliges
him
to
execute
the
police
regulations
of
society
a
task
in
which
good
sense
and
integrity
are
of
more
avail
than
legal
science
the
justice
introduces
into
the
administration
a
certain
taste
for
established
forms
and
publicity
which
renders
him
a
most
unserviceable
instrument
of
despotism
and
on
the
other
hand
he
is
not
blinded
by
those
superstitions
which
render
legal
officers
unfit
members
of
a
government
the
americans
have
adopted
the
system
of
english
justices
of
the
peace
but
they
have
deprived
it
of
that
aristocratic
character
which
is
discernible
in
the
the
governor
of
massachusetts
appoints
a
certain
number
of
justices
of
the
peace
in
every
county
whose
functions
last
seven
years
he
farther
designates
three
individuals
from
among
the
whole
body
of
justices
who
form
in
each
county
what
is
called
the
court
of
sessions
the
justices
take
a
personal
share
in
public
business
they
are
sometimes
intrusted
with
administrative
functions
in
conjunction
with
elected
officers
they
sometimes
constitute
a
tribunal
before
which
the
magistrates
summarily
prosecute
a
refractory
citizen
or
the
citizens
inform
against
the
abuses
of
the
magistrate
but
it
is
in
the
court
of
sessions
that
they
exercise
their
most
important
functions
this
court
meets
twice
a
year
in
the
county
town
in
massachusetts
it
is
empowered
to
enforce
the
obedience
of
the
greater
number
of
public
officers
it
must
be
observed
that
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
the
court
of
sessions
is
at
the
same
time
an
administrative
body
properly
so
called
and
a
political
tribunal
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
county
is
a
purely
administrative
division
the
court
of
sessions
presides
over
that
small
number
of
affairs
which
as
they
concern
several
townships
or
all
the
townships
of
the
county
in
common
can
not
be
intrusted
to
any
of
them
in
particular
in
all
that
concerns
county
business
the
duties
of
the
court
of
sessions
are
therefore
purely
administrative
and
if
in
its
investigations
it
occasionally
borrows
the
forms
of
judicial
procedure
it
is
only
with
a
view
to
its
own
information
or
as
a
guarantee
to
the
community
over
which
it
presides
but
when
the
administration
of
the
township
is
brought
before
it
it
almost
always
acts
as
a
judicial
body
and
in
some
few
cases
as
an
administrative
assembly
the
first
difficulty
is
to
procure
the
obedience
of
an
authority
so
entirely
independent
of
the
general
laws
of
the
state
as
the
township
is
we
have
stated
that
assessors
are
annually
named
by
the
town
meetings
to
levy
the
taxes
if
a
township
attempts
to
evade
the
payment
of
the
taxes
by
neglecting
to
name
its
assessors
the
court
of
sessions
condemns
it
to
a
heavy
penalty
the
fine
is
levied
on
each
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
sheriff
of
the
county
who
is
an
officer
of
justice
executes
the
mandate
thus
it
is
that
in
the
united
states
the
authority
of
the
government
is
mysteriously
concealed
under
the
forms
of
a
judicial
sentence
and
the
influence
is
at
the
same
time
fortified
by
that
irresistible
power
with
which
men
have
invested
the
formalities
of
law
these
proceedings
are
easy
to
follow
and
to
understand
the
demands
made
upon
a
township
are
in
general
plain
and
accurately
defined
they
consist
in
a
simple
fact
without
any
complication
or
in
a
principle
without
its
application
in
detail
but
the
difficulty
increases
when
it
is
not
the
obedience
of
the
township
but
that
of
the
town
officers
which
is
to
be
enforced
all
the
reprehensible
actions
of
which
a
public
functionary
may
be
guilty
are
reducible
to
the
following
heads
he
may
execute
the
law
without
energy
or
zeal
he
may
neglect
to
execute
the
law
he
may
do
what
the
law
enjoins
him
not
to
do
the
last
two
violations
of
duty
can
alone
come
under
the
cognizance
of
a
tribunal
a
positive
and
appreciable
fact
is
the
indispensable
foundation
of
an
action
at
law
thus
if
the
selectmen
omit
to
fulfil
the
legal
formalities
usual
to
town
elections
they
may
be
condemned
to
pay
a
fine
but
when
the
public
officer
performs
his
duty
without
ability
and
when
he
obeys
the
letter
of
the
law
without
zeal
or
energy
he
is
at
least
beyond
the
reach
of
judicial
interference
the
court
of
sessions
even
when
it
is
invested
with
its
administrative
powers
is
in
this
case
unable
to
compel
him
to
a
more
satisfactory
obedience
the
fear
of
removal
is
the
only
check
to
these
quasi
offences
and
as
the
court
of
sessions
does
not
originate
the
town
authorities
it
can
not
remove
functionaries
whom
it
does
not
appoint
moreover
a
perpetual
investigation
would
be
necessary
to
convict
the
subordinate
officer
of
negligence
or
lukewarmness
and
the
court
of
sessions
sits
but
twice
a
year
and
then
only
judges
such
offences
as
are
brought
before
its
notice
the
only
security
for
that
active
and
enlightened
obedience
which
a
court
of
justice
can
not
impose
upon
public
officers
lies
in
the
possibility
of
their
arbitrary
removal
in
france
this
security
is
sought
for
in
powers
exercised
by
the
heads
of
the
administration
in
america
it
is
sought
for
in
the
principle
of
election
thus
to
recapitulate
in
a
few
words
what
i
have
been
showing
if
a
public
officer
in
new
england
commits
a
crime
in
the
exercise
of
his
functions
the
ordinary
courts
of
justice
are
always
called
upon
to
pass
sentence
upon
him
if
he
commits
a
fault
in
his
official
capacity
a
purely
administrative
tribunal
is
empowered
to
punish
him
and
if
the
affair
is
important
or
urgent
the
judge
supplies
the
omission
of
the
functionary
lastly
if
the
same
individual
is
guilty
of
one
of
those
intangible
offences
of
which
human
justice
has
no
cognizance
he
annually
appears
before
a
tribunal
from
which
there
is
no
appeal
which
can
at
once
reduce
him
to
insignificance
and
deprive
him
of
his
charge
this
system
undoubtedly
possesses
great
advantages
but
its
execution
is
attended
with
a
practical
difficulty
which
it
is
important
to
point
out
i
have
already
observed
that
the
administrative
tribunal
which
is
called
the
court
of
sessions
has
no
right
of
inspection
over
the
town
officers
it
can
only
interfere
when
the
conduct
of
a
magistrate
is
specially
brought
under
its
notice
and
this
is
the
delicate
part
of
the
system
the
americans
of
new
england
are
unacquainted
with
the
office
of
public
prosecutor
in
the
court
of
sessions
and
it
may
readily
be
perceived
that
it
could
not
have
been
established
without
difficulty
if
an
accusing
magistrate
had
merely
been
appointed
in
the
chief
town
of
each
county
and
if
he
had
been
unassisted
by
agents
in
the
townships
he
would
not
have
been
better
acquainted
with
what
was
going
on
in
the
county
than
the
members
of
the
court
of
sessions
but
to
appoint
agents
in
each
township
would
have
been
to
centre
in
his
person
the
most
formidable
of
powers
that
of
a
judicial
administration
moreover
laws
are
the
children
of
habit
and
nothing
of
the
kind
exists
in
the
legislation
of
england
the
americans
have
therefore
divided
the
officers
of
inspection
and
of
prosecution
as
well
as
all
the
other
functions
of
the
administration
are
bound
by
the
law
to
apprize
the
court
to
which
they
belong
of
all
the
misdemeanors
which
may
have
been
committed
in
their
county
there
are
certain
great
offences
which
are
officially
prosecuted
by
the
state
but
more
frequently
the
task
of
punishing
delinquents
devolves
upon
the
fiscal
officer
whose
province
it
is
to
receive
the
fine
thus
the
treasurer
of
the
township
is
charged
with
the
prosecution
of
such
administrative
offences
as
fall
under
his
notice
but
a
more
especial
appeal
is
made
by
american
legislation
to
the
private
interest
of
the
citizen
and
this
great
principle
is
constantly
to
be
met
with
in
studying
the
laws
of
the
united
states
american
legislators
are
more
apt
to
give
men
credit
for
intelligence
than
for
honesty
and
they
rely
not
a
little
on
personal
cupidity
for
the
execution
of
the
laws
when
an
individual
is
really
and
sensibly
injured
by
an
administrative
abuse
it
is
natural
that
his
personal
interest
should
induce
him
to
prosecute
but
if
a
legal
formality
be
required
which
however
advantageous
to
the
community
is
of
small
importance
to
individuals
plaintiffs
may
be
less
easily
found
and
thus
by
a
tacit
agreement
the
laws
might
fall
into
disuse
reduced
by
their
system
to
this
extremity
the
americans
are
obliged
to
encourage
informers
by
bestowing
on
them
a
portion
of
the
penalty
in
certain
cases
and
to
ensure
the
execution
of
the
laws
by
the
dangerous
expedient
of
degrading
the
morals
of
the
people
the
only
administrative
authority
above
the
county
magistrates
is
properly
speaking

resources
into

i
have
already
promised
that
after
having
examined
the
constitution
of
the
township
and
the
county
of
new
england
in
detail
i
should
take
a
general
view
of
the
remainder
of
the
union
townships
and
a
local
activity
exist
in
every
state
but
in
no
part
of
the
confederation
is
a
township
to
be
met
with
precisely
similar
to
those
in
new
england
the
more
we
descend
toward
the
south
the
less
active
does
the
business
of
the
township
or
parish

number
of

rights
decreases
the
population
exercises
a
less
immediate
influence
on
affairs
are
less
frequent
and
the
subjects
of
debates
less
numerous
the
power
of
the
elected
magistrate
is
augmented
and
that
of
the
elector
diminished
while
the
public
spirit
of
the
local
communities
is
less
awakened
and
less
influential
these
differences
may
be
perceived
to
a
certain
extent
in
the
state
of
new
york
they
are
very
sensible
in
pennsylvania
but
they
become
less
striking
as
we
advance
to
the
northwest
the
majority
of
the
emigrants
who
settle
in
the
northwestern
states
are
natives
of
new
england
and
they
carry
the
habits
of
their
with
them
into
that
which
they
adopt
a
township
in
ohio
is
by
no
means
dissimilar
from
a
township
in
massachusetts
we
have
seen
that
in
massachusetts
the
principal
part
of
the
public
administration
lies
in
the
township
it
forms
the
common
centre
of
the
interests
and
affections
of
the
citizens
but
this
ceases
to
be
the
case
as
we
descend
to
states
in
which
knowledge
is
less
generally
diffused
and
where
the
township
consequently
offers
fewer
guarantees
of
a
wise
and
active
administration
as
we
leave
new
england
therefore
we
find
that
the
importance
of
the
town
is
gradually
transferred
to
the
county
which
becomes
the
centre
of
administration
and
the
intermediate
power
between
the
government
and
the
citizen
in
massachusetts
the
business
of
the
town
is
conducted
by
the
court
of
sessions
which
is
composed
of
a
named
by
the
governor
and
his
council
but
the
county
has
no
representative
assembly
and
its
expenditure
is
voted
by
the
national
legislature
in
the
great
state
of
new
york
on
the
contrary
and
in
those
of
ohio
and
pennsylvania
the
inhabitants
of
each
county
choose
a
certain
number
of
representatives
who
constitute
the
assembly
of
the
county
the
county
assembly
has
the
right
of
taxing
the
inhabitants
to
a
certain
extent
and
in
this
respect
it
enjoys
the
privileges
of
a
real
legislative
body
at
the
same
time
it
exercises
an
executive
power
in
the
county
frequently
directs
the
administration
of
the
townships
and
restricts
their
authority
within
much
narrower
bounds
than
in
massachusetts
such
are
the
principal
differences
which
the
systems
of
county
and
town
administration
present
in
the
federal
states
were
it
my
intention
to
examine
the
provisions
of
american
law
minutely
i
should
have
to
point
out
still
farther
differences
in
the
executive
details
of
the
several
communities
but
what
i
have
already
said
may
suffice
to
show
the
general
principles
on
which
the
administration
of
the
united
states
rests
these
principles
are
differently
applied
their
consequences
are
more
or
less
numerous
in
various
localities
but
they
are
always
substantially
the
same
the
laws
differ
and
their
outward
features
change
but
their
character
does
not
vary
if
the
township
and
the
county
are
not
everywhere
constituted
in
the
same
manner
it
is
at
least
true
that
in
the
united
states
the
county
and
the
township
are
always
based
upon
the
same
principle
namely
that
every
one
is
the
best
judge
of
what
concerns
himself
alone
and
the
person
most
able
to
supply
his
private
wants
the
township
and
the
county
are
therefore
bound
to
take
care
of
their
special
interests
the
state
governs
but
it
does
not
interfere
with
their
administration
exceptions
to
this
rule
may
be
met
with
but
not
a
contrary
principle
the
first
consequence
of
this
doctrine
has
been
to
cause
all
the
magistrates
to
be
chosen
either
by
or
at
least
from
among
the
citizens
as
the
officers
are
everywhere
elected
or
appointed
for
a
certain
period
it
has
been
impossible
to
establish
the
rules
of
a
dependent
series
of
authorities
there
are
almost
as
many
independent
functionaries
as
there
are
functions
and
the
executive
power
is
disseminated
in
a
multitude
of
hands
hence
arose
the
indispensable
necessity
of
introducing
the
control
of
the
courts
of
justice
over
the
administration
and
the
system
of
pecuniary
penalties
by
which
the
secondary
bodies
and
their
representatives
are
constrained
to
obey
the
laws
the
system
obtains
from
one
end
of
the
union
to
the
other
the
power
of
punishing
the
misconduct
of
public
officers
or
of
performing
the
part
of
the
executive
in
urgent
cases
has
not
however
been
bestowed
on
the
same
judges
in
all
the
states
the
derived
the
institution
of
justices
of
the
peace
from
a
common
source
but
although
it
exists
in
all
the
states
it
is
not
always
turned
to
the
same
use
the
justices
of
the
peace
everywhere
participate
in
the
administration
of
the
townships
and
the
counties
either
as
public
officers
or
as
the
judges
of
public
misdemeanors
but
in
most
of
the
states
the
more
important
classes
of
public
offences
come
under
the
cognisance
of
the
ordinary
tribunals
the
election
of
public
officers
or
the
inalienability
of
their
functions
the
absence
of
a
gradation
of
powers
and
the
introduction
of
a
judicial
control
over
the
secondary
branches
of
the
administration
are
the
universal
characteristics
of
the
american
system
from
maine
to
the
floridas
in
some
states
and
that
of
new
york
has
advanced
most
in
this
direction
traces
of
a
centralised
administration
begin
to
be
discernible
in
the
state
of
new
york
the
officers
of
the
central
government
exercise
in
certain
cases
a
sort
of
inspection
of
control
over
the
secondary
bodies
at
other
times
they
constitute
a
court
of
appeal
for
the
decision
of
affairs
in
the
state
of
new
york
judicial
penalties
are
less
used
than
in
other
parts
as
a
means
of
administration
and
the
right
of
prosecuting
the
offences
of
public
officers
is
vested
in
fewer
hands
the
same
tendency
is
faintly
observable
in
some
other
states
but
in
general
the
prominent
feature
of
the
administration
in
the
united
states
is
its
excessive
local
independence
of
the
state
i
have
described
the
townships
and
the
administration
it
now
remains
for
me
to
speak
of
the
state
and
government
this
is
ground
i
may
pass
over
rapidly
without
fear
of
being
misunderstood
for
all
i
have
to
say
is
to
be
found
in
written
forms
of
the
various
constitutions
which
are
easily
to
be
procured
these
constitutions
rest
upon
a
simple
and
rational
theory
their
forms
have
been
adopted
by
all
constitutional
nations
and
are
become
familiar
to
us
in
this
place
therefore
it
is
only
necessary
for
me
to
give
a
short
analysis
i
shall
endeavor
afterward
to
pass
judgment
upon
what
i
now
describe
legislative
power
of
the
state
division
of
the
legislative
body
into
two
house
of
different
functions
of
these
two
bodies
the
legislative
power
of
the
state
is
vested
in
two
assemblies
the
first
of
which
generally
bears
the
name
of
the
senate
the
senate
is
commonly
a
legislative
body
but
it
sometimes
becomes
an
executive
and
judicial
one
it
takes
a
part
in
the
government
in
several
ways
according
to
the
constitution
of
the
different
states
but
it
is
in
the
nomination
of
public
functionaries
that
it
most
commonly
assumes
an
executive
power
it
partakes
of
judicial
power
in
the
trial
of
certain
political
offences
and
sometimes
also
in
the
decision
of
certain
civil
cases
the
number
of
its
members
is
always
small
the
other
branch
of
the
legislature
which
is
usually
called
the
house
of
representatives
has
no
share
whatever
in
the
administration
and
only
takes
a
part
in
the
judicial
power
inasmuch
as
it
impeaches
public
functionaries
before
the
senate
the
members
of
the
two
houses
are
nearly
everywhere
subject
to
the
same
conditions
of
election
they
are
chosen
in
the
same
manner
and
by
the
same
citizens
the
only
difference
which
exists
between
them
is
that
the
term
for
which
the
senate
is
chosen
is
in
general
longer
than
that
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
latter
seldom
remain
in
office
longer
than
a
year
the
former
usually
sit
two
or
three
years
by
granting
to
the
senators
the
privilege
of
being
chosen
for
several
years
and
being
renewed
seriatim
the
law
takes
care
to
preserve
in
the
legislative
body
a
nucleus
of
men
already
accustomed
to
public
business
and
capable
of
exercising
a
salutary
influence
upon
the
junior
members
the
americans
plainly
did
not
desire
by
this
separation
of
the
legislative
body
into
two
branches
to
make
one
house
hereditary
and
the
other
elective
one
aristocratic
and
the
other
democratic
it
was
not
their
object
to
create
in
the
one
a
bulwark
to
power
while
the
other
represented
the
interests
and
passions
of
the
people
the
only
advantages
which
result
from
the
present
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
the
division
of
the
legislative
power
and
the
consequent
check
upon
political
assemblies
with
the
creation
of
a
tribunal
of
appeal
for
the
revision
of
the
laws
time
and
experience
however
have
convinced
the
americans
that
if
these
are
its
only
advantages
the
division
of
the
legislative
power
is
still
a
principle
of
the
greatest
necessity
pennsylvania
was
the
only
one
of
the
united
states
which
at
first
attempted
to
establish
a
single
house
of
assembly
and
franklin
himself
was
so
far
carried
away
by
the
necessary
consequences
of
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
as
to
have
concurred
in
the
measure
but
the
pennsylvanians
were
soon
obliged
to
change
the
law
and
to
create
two
houses
thus
the
principle
of
the
division
of
the
legislative
power
was
finally
established
and
its
necessity
may
henceforward
be
regarded
as
a
demonstrated
truth
this
theory
which
was
nearly
unknown
to
the
republics
of
antiquity
which
was
introduced
into
the
world
almost
by
accident
like
so
many
other
great
truths
and
misunderstood
by
several
modern
nations
is
at
length
become
an
axiom
in
the
political
science
of
the
present
age
the
executive
power
of
the
state
office
of
governor
in
an
american
the
place
he
occupies
in
relation
to
the
his
rights
and
his
his
dependence
on
the
people
the
executive
power
of
the
state
may
with
truth
be
said
to
be
by
the
governor
although
he
enjoys
but
a
portion
of
its
rights
the
supreme
magistrate
under
the
title
of
governor
is
the
official
moderator
and
counsellor
of
the
legislature
he
is
armed
with
a
suspensive
veto
which
allows
him
to
stop
or
at
least
to
retard
its
movements
at
pleasure
he
lays
the
wants
of
the
country
before
the
legislative
body
and
points
out
the
means
which
he
thinks
may
be
usefully
employed
in
providing
for
them
he
is
the
natural
executor
of
its
decrees
in
all
the
undertakings
which
interest
the
nation
at
large
in
the
absence
of
the
legislature
the
governor
is
bound
to
take
all
necessary
steps
to
guard
the
state
against
violent
shocks
and
unforeseen
dangers
the
whole
military
power
of
the
state
is
at
the
disposal
of
the
governor
he
is
commander
of
the
militia
and
head
of
the
armed
force
when
the
authority
which
is
by
general
consent
awarded
to
the
laws
is
disregarded
the
governor
puts
himself
at
the
head
of
the
armed
force
of
the
state
to
quell
resistance
and
to
restore
order
lastly
the
governor
takes
no
share
in
the
administration
of
townships
and
counties
except
it
be
indirectly
in
the
nomination
of
justices
of
the
peace
which
nomination
he
has
not
the
power
to
revoke
the
governor
is
an
elected
magistrate
and
is
generally
chosen
for
one
or
two
years
only
so
that
he
always
continues
to
be
strictly
dependent
on
the
majority
who
returned
him
political
effects
of
the
system
of
local
administration
in
the
united
states
necessary
distinction
between
the
general
centralisation
of
government
and
the
centralisation
of
the
local
local
administration
not
centralized
in
the
united
states
great
general
centralisation
of
the
some
bad
consequences
resulting
to
the
united
states
from
the
local
administrative
advantages
attending
the
order
of
the
power
which
conducts
the
government
is
less
regular
less
enlightened
less
learned
but
much
greater
than
in
political
advantages
of
this
order
of
in
the
united
states
the
interests
of
the
country
are
everywhere
kept
in
support
given
to
the
government
by
the
provincial
institutions
more
necessary
in
proportion
as
the
social
condition
becomes
more
reason
of
this
centralisation
is
become
a
word
of
general
and
daily
use
without
any
precise
meaning
being
attached
to
it
nevertheless
there
exist
two
distinct
kinds
of
centralisation
which
it
is
necessary
to
discriminate
with
accuracy
certain
interests
are
common
to
all
parts
of
a
nation
such
as
the
enactment
of
its
general
laws
and
the
maintenance
of
its
foreign
relations
other
interests
are
peculiar
to
certain
parts
of
the
nation
such
for
instance
as
the
business
of
different
townships
when
the
power
which
directs
the
general
interests
is
centred
in
one
place
or
in
the
same
persons
it
constitutes
a
central
government
the
power
of
directing
partial
or
local
interests
when
brought
together
in
like
manner
constitutes
what
may
be
termed
a
central
administration
upon
some
points
these
two
kinds
of
centralisation
coalesce
but
by
classifying
the
objects
which
fall
more
particularly
within
the
province
of
each
of
them
they
may
easily
be
distinguished
it
is
evident
that
a
central
government
acquires
immense
power
when
united
to
administrative
centralisation
thus
combined
it
accustoms
men
to
set
their
own
will
habitually
and
completely
aside
to
submit
not
only
for
once
or
upon
one
point
but
in
every
respect
and
at
all
times
not
only
therefore
does
the
union
of
power
subdue
them
by
force
but
it
affects
them
in
the
ordinary
habits
of
life
and
influences
each
individual
first
separately
and
then
collectively
these
two
kinds
of
centralisation
mutually
assist
and
attract
each
other
but
they
must
not
be
supposed
to
be
inseparable
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
more
completely
central
government
than
that
which
existed
in
france
under
louis
xiv
when
the
same
individual
was
the
author
and
the
interpreter
of
the
laws
and
being
the
representative
of
france
at
home
and
abroad
he
was
justified
in
asserting
that
the
state
was
identified
with
his
person
nevertheless
the
administration
was
much
less
centralized
under
louis
than
it
is
at
the
present
day
in
england
the
centralisation
of
the
government
is
carried
to
great
perfection
the
state
has
the
compact
vigor
of
a
man
and
by
the
sole
act
of
its
will
it
puts
immense
engines
in
motion
and
wields
or
collects
the
efforts
of
its
authority
indeed
i
can
not
conceive
that
a
nation
can
enjoy
a
secure
or
prosperous
existence
without
a
powerful
centralisation
of
government
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
a
central
administration
enervates
the
nations
in
which
it
exists
by
incessantly
diminishing
their
public
spirit
if
such
an
administration
succeeds
in
condensing
at
a
given
moment
on
a
given
point
all
the
disposable
resources
of
a
people
it
impairs
at
least
the
renewal
of
those
resources
it
may
ensure
a
victory
in
the
hour
of
strife
but
it
gradually
relaxes
the
sinews
of
strength
it
may
contribute
admirably
to
the
transient
greatness
of
a
man
but
it
can
not
ensure
the
durable
prosperity
of
a
people
if
we
pay
proper
attention
we
shall
find
that
whenever
it
is
said
that
a
state
can
not
act
because
it
has
no
central
point
it
is
the
centralisation
of
the
government
in
which
it
is
deficient
it
is
frequently
asserted
and
we
are
prepared
to
assent
to
the
proposition
that
the
german
empire
was
never
able
to
bring
all
its
powers
into
action
but
the
reason
was
that
the
state
has
never
been
able
to
enforce
obedience
to
its
general
laws
because
the
several
members
of
that
great
body
always
claimed
the
right
or
found
the
means
of
refusing
their
to
the
representatives
of
the
common
authority
even
in
the
affairs
which
concerned
the
mass
of
the
people
in
other
words
because
there
was
no
centralisation
of
government
the
same
remark
is
applicable
to
the
middle
ages
the
cause
of
all
the
confusion
of
feudal
society
was
that
the
control
not
only
of
local
but
of
general
interests
was
divided
among
a
thousand
hands
and
broken
up
in
a
thousand
different
ways
the
absence
of
a
central
government
prevented
the
nations
of
europe
from
advancing
with
energy
in
any
straightforward
course
we
have
shown
that
in
the
united
states
no
central
administration
and
no
dependent
series
of
public
functionaries
exist
local
authority
has
been
carried
to
lengths
which
no
european
nation
could
endure
without
great
inconvenience
and
which
have
even
produced
some
disadvantageous
consequences
in
america
but
in
the
united
states
the
centralisation
of
the
government
is
complete
and
it
would
be
easy
to
prove
that
the
national
power
is
more
compact
than
it
has
ever
been
in
the
old
monarchies
of
europe
not
only
is
there
but
one
legislative
body
in
each
state
not
only
does
there
exist
but
one
source
of
political
authority
but
numerous
district
assemblies
and
county
courts
have
in
general
been
avoided
lest
they
should
be
tempted
to
exceed
their
administrative
duties
and
interfere
with
the
government
in
america
the
legislature
of
each
state
is
supreme
nothing
can
impede
its
authority
neither
privileges
nor
local
immunities
nor
personal
influence
nor
even
the
empire
of
reason
since
it
represents
that
majority
which
claims
to
be
the
sole
organ
of
reason
its
own
determination
is
therefore
the
only
limit
to
its
action
in
juxtaposition
to
it
and
under
its
immediate
control
is
the
representative
of
the
executive
power
whose
duty
it
is
to
constrain
the
refractory
to
submit
by
superior
force
the
only
symptom
of
weakness
lies
in
certain
details
of
the
action
of
the
government
the
american
republics
have
no
standing
armies
to
intimidate
a
discontented
minority
but
as
no
minority
has
as
yet
been
reduced
to
declare
open
war
the
necessity
of
an
army
has
not
been
felt
the
state
usually
employs
the
officers
of
the
township
or
the
county
to
deal
with
the
citizens
thus
for
instance
in
new
england
the
assessor
fixes
the
rate
of
taxes
the
collector
receives
them
the
town
treasurer
transmits
the
amount
to
the
public
treasury
and
the
disputes
which
may
arise
are
brought
before
the
ordinary
courts
of
justice
this
method
of
collecting
taxes
is
slow
as
well
as
inconvenient
and
it
would
prove
a
perpetual
hindrance
to
a
government
whose
pecuniary
demands
were
large
in
general
it
is
desirable
that
in
what
ever
materially
affects
its
existence
the
government
should
be
served
by
officers
of
its
own
appointed
by
itself
removable
at
pleasure
and
accustomed
to
rapid
methods
of
proceeding
but
it
will
always
be
easy
for
the
central
government
organized
as
it
is
in
america
to
introduce
new
and
more
efficacious
modes
of
action
proportioned
to
its
wants
the
absence
of
a
central
government
will
not
then
as
has
often
been
asserted
prove
the
destruction
of
the
republics
of
the
new
world
far
from
supposing
that
the
american
governments
are
not
sufficiently
centralized
i
shall
prove
hereafter
that
they
are
too
much
so
the
legislative
bodies
daily
encroach
upon
the
authority
of
the
government
and
their
tendency
like
that
of
the
french
convention
is
to
appropriate
it
entirely
to
themselves
under
these
circumstances
the
social
power
is
constantly
changing
hands
because
it
is
subordinate
to
the
power
of
the
people
which
is
too
apt
to
forget
the
maxims
of
wisdom
and
of
foresight
in
the
consciousness
of
its
strength
hence
arises
its
danger
and
thus
its
vigor
and
not
its
impotence
will
probably
be
the
cause
of
its
ultimate
destruction
the
system
of
local
administration
produces
several
different
effects
in
america
the
americans
seem
to
me
to
have
outstepped
the
limits
of
sound
policy
in
isolating
the
administration
of
the
government
for
order
even
in
affairs
is
a
matter
of
national
importance
as
the
state
has
no
administrative
functionaries
of
its
own
stationed
on
different
parts
of
its
territory
to
whom
it
can
give
a
common
impulse
the
consequence
is
that
it
rarely
attempts
to
issue
any
general
police
regulations
the
want
of
these
regulations
is
severely
felt
and
is
frequently
observed
by
europeans
the
appearance
of
disorder
which
prevails
on
the
surface
leads
them
at
first
to
imagine
that
society
is
in
a
state
of
anarchy
nor
do
they
perceive
their
mistake
till
they
have
gone
deeper
into
the
subject
certain
undertakings
are
of
importance
to
the
whole
state
but
they
can
not
be
put
in
execution
because
there
is
no
national
administration
to
direct
them
abandoned
to
the
exertions
of
the
towns
or
counties
under
the
care
of
elected
or
temporary
agents
they
lead
to
no
result
or
at
least
to
no
durable
benefit
the
partisans
of
centralisation
in
europe
maintain
that
the
government
directs
the
affairs
of
each
locality
better
than
the
citizens
could
do
it
for
themselves
this
may
be
true
when
the
central
power
is
enlightened
and
when
the
local
districts
are
ignorant
when
it
is
as
alert
as
they
are
slow
when
it
is
accustomed
to
act
and
they
to
obey
indeed
it
is
evident
that
this
double
tendency
must
augment
with
the
increase
of
centralisation
and
that
the
readiness
of
the
one
and
the
incapacity
of
the
others
must
become
more
and
more
prominent
but
i
deny
that
such
is
the
case
when
the
people
is
as
enlightened
as
awake
to
its
interests
and
as
accustomed
to
reflect
on
them
as
the
americans
are
i
am
persuaded
on
the
contrary
that
in
this
case
the
collective
strength
of
the
citizens
will
always
conduce
more
efficaciously
to
the
public
welfare
than
the
authority
of
the
government
it
is
difficult
to
point
out
with
certainty
the
means
of
arousing
a
sleeping
population
and
of
giving
it
passions
and
knowledge
which
it
does
not
possess
it
is
i
am
well
aware
an
arduous
task
to
persuade
men
to
busy
themselves
about
their
own
affairs
and
it
would
frequently
be
easier
to
interest
them
in
the
punctilios
of
court
etiquette
than
in
the
repairs
of
their
common
dwelling
but
whenever
a
central
administration
affects
to
supersede
the
persons
most
interested
i
am
inclined
to
suppose
that
it
is
either
misled
or
desirous
to
mislead
however
enlightened
and
however
skilful
a
central
power
may
be
it
can
not
of
itself
embrace
all
the
details
of
the
existence
of
a
great
nation
such
vigilance
exceeds
the
powers
of
man
and
when
it
attempts
to
create
and
set
in
motion
so
many
complicated
springs
it
must
submit
to
a
very
imperfect
result
or
consume
itself
in
bootless
efforts
centralisation
succeeds
more
easily
indeed
in
subjecting
the
external
actions
of
men
to
a
certain
uniformity
which
at
last
commands
our
regard
independently
of
the
objects
to
which
it
is
applied
like
those
devotees
who
worship
the
statue
and
forget
the
deity
it
represents
centralisation
imparts
without
difficulty
an
admirable
regularity
to
the
routine
of
business
rules
the
details
of
the
social
police
with
sagacity
represses
the
smallest
disorder
and
the
most
petty
misdemeanors
maintains
society
in
a
alike
secure
from
improvement
and
decline
and
perpetuates
a
drowsy
precision
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
which
is
hailed
by
the
heads
of
the
administration
as
a
sign
of
perfect
order
and
public
tranquillity
in
short
it
excels
more
in
prevention
than
in
action
its
force
deserts
it
when
society
is
to
be
disturbed
or
accelerated
in
its
course
and
if
once
the
of
private
citizens
is
necessary
to
the
furtherance
of
its
measures
the
secret
of
its
impotence
is
disclosed
even
while
it
invokes
their
assistance
it
is
on
the
condition
that
they
shall
act
exactly
as
much
as
the
government
chooses
and
exactly
in
the
manner
it
appoints
they
are
to
take
charge
of
the
details
without
aspiring
to
guide
the
system
they
are
to
work
in
a
dark
and
subordinate
sphere
and
only
to
judge
the
acts
in
which
they
have
themselves
by
their
results
these
however
are
not
conditions
on
which
the
alliance
of
the
human
will
is
to
be
obtained
its
carriage
must
be
free
and
its
actions
responsible
or
such
is
the
constitution
of
man
the
citizen
had
rather
remain
a
passive
spectator
than
a
dependent
actor
in
schemes
with
which
he
is
unacquainted
it
is
undeniable
that
the
want
of
those
uniform
regulations
which
control
the
conduct
of
every
inhabitant
of
france
is
not
unfrequently
felt
in
the
united
states
gross
instances
of
social
indifference
and
neglect
are
to
be
met
with
and
from
time
to
time
disgraceful
blemishes
are
seen
in
complete
contrast
with
the
surrounding
civilisation
useful
undertakings
which
can
not
succeed
without
perpetual
attention
and
rigorous
exactitude
are
very
frequently
abandoned
in
the
end
for
in
america
as
well
as
in
other
countries
the
people
is
subject
to
sudden
impulses
and
momentary
exertions
the
european
who
is
accustomed
to
find
a
functionary
always
at
hand
to
interfere
with
all
he
undertakes
has
some
difficulty
in
accustoming
himself
to
the
complex
mechanism
of
the
administration
of
the
townships
in
general
it
may
be
affirmed
that
the
lesser
details
of
the
police
which
render
life
easy
and
comfortable
are
neglected
in
america
but
that
the
essential
guarantees
of
man
in
society
are
as
strong
there
as
elsewhere
in
america
the
power
which
conducts
the
government
is
far
less
regular
less
enlightened
and
less
learned
but
a
hundredfold
more
authoritative
than
in
europe
in
no
country
in
the
world
do
the
citizens
make
such
exertions
for
the
common
weal
and
i
am
acquainted
with
no
people
which
has
established
schools
as
numerous
and
as
efficacious
places
of
public
worship
better
suited
to
the
wants
of
the
inhabitants
or
roads
kept
in
better
repair
uniformity
or
permanence
of
design
the
minute
arrangement
of
details
and
the
perfection
of
an
ingenious
administration
must
not
be
sought
for
in
the
united
states
but
it
will
be
easy
to
find
on
the
other
hand
the
symptoms
of
a
power
which
if
it
is
somewhat
barbarous
is
at
least
robust
and
of
an
existence
which
is
checkered
with
accidents
indeed
but
cheered
at
the
same
time
by
animation
and
effort
granting
for
an
instant
that
the
villages
and
counties
of
the
united
states
would
be
more
usefully
governed
by
a
remote
authority
which
they
had
never
seen
than
by
functionaries
taken
from
the
midst
of
them
admitting
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
country
would
be
more
secure
and
the
resources
of
society
better
employed
if
the
whole
administration
centred
in
a
single
arm
still
the
advantages
which
the
americans
derive
from
their
system
would
induce
me
to
prefer
it
to
the
contrary
plan
it
profits
me
but
little
after
all
that
a
vigilant
authority
protects
the
tranquillity
of
my
pleasures
and
constantly
averts
all
danger
from
my
path
without
my
care
or
my
concern
if
the
same
authority
is
the
absolute
mistress
of
my
liberty
and
of
my
life
and
if
it
so
monopolises
all
the
energy
of
existence
that
when
it
languishes
everything
languishes
around
it
that
when
it
sleeps
everything
must
sleep
that
when
it
dies
the
state
itself
must
perish
in
certain
countries
of
europe
the
natives
consider
themselves
as
a
kind
of
settlers
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
the
spot
upon
which
they
live
the
greatest
changes
are
effected
without
their
concurrence
and
unless
chance
may
have
apprised
them
of
the
event
without
their
knowledge
nay
more
the
citizen
is
unconcerned
as
to
the
condition
of
his
village
the
police
of
his
street
the
repairs
of
the
church
or
the
parsonage
for
he
looks
upon
all
these
things
as
unconnected
with
himself
and
as
the
property
of
a
powerful
stranger
whom
he
calls
the
government
he
has
only
a
in
these
possessions
and
he
entertains
no
notions
of
ownership
or
of
improvement
this
want
of
interest
in
his
own
affairs
goes
so
far
that
if
his
own
safety
or
that
of
his
children
is
endangered
instead
of
trying
to
avert
the
peril
he
will
fold
his
arms
and
wait
till
the
nation
comes
to
his
assistance
this
same
individual
who
has
so
completely
sacrificed
his
own
free
will
has
no
natural
propensity
to
obedience
he
cowers
it
is
true
before
the
pettiest
officer
but
he
braves
the
law
with
the
spirit
of
a
conquered
foe
as
soon
as
its
superior
force
is
removed
his
oscillations
between
servitude
and
license
are
perpetual
when
a
nation
has
arrived
at
this
state
it
must
either
change
its
customs
and
its
laws
or
perish
the
source
of
public
virtue
is
dry
and
though
it
may
contain
subjects
the
race
of
citizens
is
extinct
such
communities
are
a
natural
prey
to
foreign
conquest
and
if
they
do
not
disappear
from
the
scene
of
life
it
is
because
they
are
surrounded
by
other
nations
similar
or
inferior
to
themselves
it
is
because
the
instinctive
feeling
of
their
claims
still
exists
in
their
hearts
and
because
an
involuntary
pride
in
the
name
it
bears
or
the
vague
reminiscence
of
its
fame
suffices
to
give
them
the
impulse
of
nor
can
the
prodigious
exertions
made
by
certain
people
in
the
defence
of
a
country
in
which
they
may
almost
be
said
to
have
lived
as
aliens
be
adduced
in
favor
of
such
a
system
for
it
will
be
found
that
in
these
cases
their
main
incitement
was
religion
the
permanence
the
glory
and
the
prosperity
of
the
nation
were
become
parts
of
their
faith
and
in
defending
the
country
they
inhabited
they
defended
that
holy
city
of
which
they
were
all
citizens
the
turkish
tribes
have
never
taken
an
active
share
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
society
but
they
accomplished
stupendous
enterprises
as
long
as
the
victories
of
the
sultans
were
the
triumphs
of
the
mohammedan
faith
in
the
present
age
they
are
in
rapid
decay
because
their
religion
is
departing
and
despotism
only
remains
montesquieu
who
attributed
to
absolute
power
an
authority
peculiar
to
itself
did
it
as
i
conceive
undeserved
honor
for
despotism
taken
by
itself
can
produce
no
durable
results
on
close
inspection
we
shall
find
that
religion
and
not
fear
has
ever
been
the
cause
of
the
prosperity
of
absolute
governments
whatever
exertions
may
be
made
no
true
power
can
be
founded
among
men
which
does
not
depend
upon
the
free
union
of
their
inclinations
and
patriotism
and
religion
are
the
only
two
motives
in
the
world
which
can
permanently
direct
the
whole
of
a
body
politic
to
one
end
laws
can
not
succeed
in
rekindling
the
ardor
of
an
extinguished
faith
but
men
may
be
interested
in
the
fate
of
their
country
by
the
laws
by
this
influence
the
vague
impulse
of
patriotism
which
never
abandons
the
human
heart
may
be
directed
and
revived
and
if
it
be
connected
with
the
thoughts
the
passions
and
daily
habits
of
life
it
may
be
consolidated
into
a
durable
and
rational
sentiment
let
it
not
be
said
that
the
time
for
the
experiment
is
already
past
for
the
old
age
of
nations
is
not
like
the
old
age
of
men
and
every
fresh
generation
is
a
new
people
ready
for
the
care
of
the
legislator
it
is
not
the
but
the
effects
of
the
local
system
that
i
most
admire
in
america
in
the
united
states
the
interests
of
the
country
are
everywhere
kept
in
view
they
are
an
object
of
solicitude
to
the
people
of
the
whole
union
and
every
citizen
is
as
warmly
attached
to
them
as
if
they
were
his
own
he
takes
pride
in
the
glory
of
his
nation
he
boasts
of
his
success
to
which
he
conceives
himself
to
have
contributed
and
he
rejoices
in
the
general
prosperity
by
which
he
profits
the
feeling
he
entertains
toward
the
state
is
analogous
to
that
which
unites
him
to
his
family
and
it
is
by
a
kind
of
egotism
that
he
interests
himself
in
the
welfare
of
his
country
the
european
generally
submits
to
a
public
officer
because
he
represents
a
superior
force
but
to
an
american
he
represents
a
right
in
america
it
may
be
said
that
no
one
renders
obedience
to
man
but
to
justice
and
to
law
if
the
opinion
which
the
citizen
entertains
of
himself
is
exaggerated
it
is
at
least
salutary
he
unhesitatingly
confides
in
his
own
powers
which
appear
to
him
to
be
when
a
private
individual
meditates
an
undertaking
however
directly
connected
it
may
be
with
the
welfare
of
society
he
never
thinks
of
soliciting
the
of
the
government
but
he
publishes
his
plan
offers
to
execute
it
himself
courts
the
assistance
of
other
individuals
and
struggles
manfully
against
all
obstacles
undoubtedly
he
is
less
successful
than
the
state
might
have
been
in
his
position
but
in
the
end
the
sum
of
these
private
undertakings
far
exceeds
all
that
the
government
could
effect
as
the
administrative
authority
is
within
the
reach
of
the
citizens
whom
it
in
some
degree
represents
it
excites
neither
their
jealousy
nor
their
hatred
as
its
resources
are
limited
every
one
feels
that
he
must
not
rely
solely
on
its
assistance
thus
when
the
administration
thinks
fit
to
interfere
it
is
not
abandoned
to
itself
as
in
europe
the
duties
of
the
private
citizens
are
not
supposed
to
have
lapsed
because
the
state
assists
in
their
fulfilment
but
every
one
is
ready
on
the
contrary
to
guide
and
to
support
it
this
action
of
individual
exertions
joined
to
that
of
the
public
authorities
frequently
performs
what
the
most
energetic
central
administration
would
be
unable
to
execute
it
would
be
easy
to
adduce
several
facts
in
proof
of
what
i
advance
but
i
had
rather
give
only
one
with
which
i
am
more
thoroughly
acquainted
in
america
the
means
which
the
authorities
have
at
their
disposal
for
the
discovery
of
crimes
and
the
arrest
of
criminals
are
few
a
state
police
does
not
exist
and
passports
are
unknown
the
criminal
police
of
the
united
states
can
not
be
compared
with
that
of
france
the
magistrates
and
public
prosecutors
are
not
numerous
and
the
examinations
of
prisoners
are
rapid
and
oral
nevertheless
in
no
country
does
crime
more
rarely
elude
punishment
the
reason
is
that
every
one
conceives
himself
to
be
interested
in
furnishing
evidence
of
the
act
committed
and
in
stopping
the
delinquent
during
my
stay
in
the
united
states
i
saw
the
spontaneous
formation
of
committees
for
the
pursuit
and
prosecution
of
a
man
who
had
committed
a
great
crime
in
a
certain
county
in
europe
a
criminal
is
an
unhappy
being
who
is
struggling
for
his
life
against
the
ministers
of
justice
while
the
population
is
merely
a
spectator
of
the
conflict
in
america
he
is
looked
upon
as
an
enemy
of
the
human
race
and
the
whole
of
mankind
is
against
him
i
believe
that
provincial
institutions
are
useful
to
all
nations
but
nowhere
do
they
appear
to
me
to
be
more
indispensable
than
among
a
democratic
people
in
an
aristocracy
order
can
always
be
maintained
in
the
midst
of
liberty
and
as
the
rulers
have
a
great
deal
to
lose
order
is
to
them
a
consideration
in
like
manner
an
aristocracy
protects
the
people
from
the
excesses
of
despotism
because
it
always
possesses
an
organized
power
ready
to
resist
a
despot
but
a
democracy
without
provincial
institutions
has
no
security
against
these
evils
how
can
a
populace
unaccustomed
to
freedom
in
small
concerns
learn
to
use
it
temperately
in
great
affairs
what
resistance
can
be
offered
to
tyranny
in
a
country
where
every
private
individual
is
impotent
and
where
the
citizens
are
united
by
no
common
tie
those
who
dread
the
license
of
the
mob
and
those
who
fear
the
rule
of
absolute
power
ought
alike
to
desire
the
progressive
growth
of
provincial
liberties
on
the
other
hand
i
am
convinced
that
democratic
nations
are
most
exposed
to
fall
beneath
the
yoke
of
a
central
administration
for
several
reasons
among
which
is
the
following
the
constant
tendency
of
these
nations
is
to
concentrate
all
the
strength
of
the
government
in
the
hands
of
the
only
power
which
directly
represents
the
people
because
beyond
the
people
nothing
is
to
be
perceived
but
a
mass
of
equal
individuals
confounded
together
but
when
the
same
power
is
already
in
possession
of
all
the
attributes
of
the
government
it
can
scarcely
refrain
from
penetrating
into
the
details
of
the
administration
and
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
is
sure
to
present
itself
in
the
end
as
was
the
case
in
france
in
the
french
revolution
there
were
two
impulses
in
opposite
directions
which
must
never
be
confounded
the
one
was
favorable
to
liberty
the
other
to
despotism
under
the
ancient
monarchy
the
king
was
the
sole
author
of
the
laws
and
below
the
power
of
the
sovereign
certain
vestiges
of
provincial
institutions
were
still
distinguishable
these
provincial
institutions
were
incoherent
and
frequently
absurd
in
the
hands
of
the
aristocracy
they
had
sometimes
been
converted
into
instruments
of
oppression
the
revolution
declared
itself
the
enemy
of
royalty
and
of
provincial
institutions
at
the
same
time
it
confounded
all
that
had
preceded
it
despotic
power
and
the
checks
to
its
abuses
in
an
indiscriminate
hatred
and
its
tendency
was
at
once
to
republicanism
and
to
centralisation
this
double
character
of
the
french
revolution
is
a
fact
which
has
been
adroitly
handled
by
the
friends
of
absolute
power
can
they
be
accused
of
laboring
in
the
cause
of
despotism
when
they
are
defending
of
the
revolution
in
this
manner
popularity
may
be
conciliated
with
hostility
to
the
rights
of
the
people
and
the
secret
slave
of
tyranny
may
be
the
professed
admirer
of
freedom
i
have
visited
the
two
nations
in
which
the
system
of
provincial
liberty
has
been
most
perfectly
established
and
i
have
listened
to
the
opinions
of
different
parties
in
those
countries
in
america
i
met
with
men
who
secretly
aspired
to
destroy
the
democratic
institutions
of
the
union
in
england
i
found
others
who
attacked
aristocracy
openly
but
i
know
of
no
one
who
does
not
regard
provincial
independence
as
a
great
benefit
in
both
countries
i
have
heard
a
thousand
different
causes
assigned
for
the
evils
of
the
state
but
the
local
system
was
never
mentioned
among
them
i
have
heard
citizens
attribute
the
power
and
prosperity
of
their
country
to
a
multitude
of
reasons
but
they
placed
the
advantages
of
local
institutions
in
the
foremost
rank
am
i
to
suppose
that
when
men
who
are
naturally
so
divided
on
religious
opinions
and
on
political
theories
agree
on
one
point
and
that
one
of
which
they
have
daily
experience
they
are
all
in
error
the
only
nations
which
deny
the
utility
of
provincial
liberties
are
those
which
have
fewest
of
them
in
other
words
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
institution
are
the
only
persons
who
pass
a
censure
upon
it
notes
it
is
by
this
periphrasis
that
i
attempt
to
render
the
french
expressions
and
i
am
not
aware
that
any
english
word
precisely
corresponds
to
the
general
term
of
the
original
in
france
every
association
of
human
dwellings
forms
a
and
every
commune
is
governed
by
a
and
a
in
other
words
the
or
municipal
privilege
which
belongs
in
england
to
chartered
corporations
alone
is
alike
extended
to
every
commune
into
which
the
cantons
and
departments
of
france
were
divided
at
the
revolution
thence
the
different
application
of
the
expression
which
is
general
in
one
country
and
restricted
in
the
other
in
america
the
counties
of
the
northern
states
are
divided
into
townships
those
of
the
southern
into
parishes
besides

to
me
to

most
perfect

species

the
condition

never

am
convinced
that
when

opened

observation
it
will
be
found
to
contain
the
most
perfect
model
of

of
talent

in
the
comparison
which

has
proved
that
ingenuity
can
not
always
supply
the
place

a
knowledge
of
facts

justly
reproaches
the
americans
for
the
sort
of
confusion
which
exists
in
the
accounts

the
expenditure
in
the
townships

after
giving
the
model
of
a
departmental
budget
in

he
adds
we
are
indebted
to
centralisation
that
admirable
invention
of
a
great
man
for
the
uniform
order
and
method
which
prevail
alike
in
all
the
municipal
budgets
from
the
largest
town
to
the
humblest
commune
whatever
may
be
my
admiration
of
this
result
when
i
see
the
communes
of
france
with
their
excellent
system
of
accounts
plunged
in
the
grossest
ignorance
of
their
true
interests
and
abandoned
to
so
incorrigible
an
apathy
that
they
seem
to
vegetate
rather
than
to
live
when
on
the
other
hand
i
observe
the
activity
the
information
and
the
spirit
of
enterprise
which
keeps
society
in
perpetual
labor
in
those
american
townships
whose
budgets
are
drawn
up
with
small
method
and
with
still
less
uniformity
i
am
struck
by
the
spectacle
for
to
my
mind
the
end
of
a
good
government
is
to
ensure
the
welfare
of
a
people
and
not
to
establish
order
and
regularity
in
the
midst
of
its
misery
and
its
distress
i
am
therefore
led
to
suppose
that
the
prosperity
of
the
american
townships
and
the
apparent
confusion
of
their
accounts
the
distress
of
the
french
communes

the
perfection

may
be
attributable
to
the

cause
at
any
rate

am
suspicious
of

benefit

is
united

so
many
evils

prevent
its
abuse
i
have
thought
it
essential
to
devote
a
separate
chapter
to
the
judicial
authorities
of
the
united
states
lest
their
great
political
importance
should
be
lessened
in
the
reader
eyes
by
a
merely
incidental
mention
of
them
confederations
have
existed
in
other
countries
beside
america
and
republics
have
not
been
established
on
the
shores
of
the
new
world
alone
the
representative
system
of
government
has
been
adopted
in
several
states
of
europe
but
i
am
not
aware
that
any
nation
of
the
globe
has
hitherto
organized
a
judicial
power
on
the
principle
adopted
by
the
americans
the
judicial
organization
of
the
united
states
is
the
institution
which
the
stranger
has
the
greatest
difficulty
in
understanding
he
hears
the
authority
of
a
judge
invoked
in
the
political
occurrences
of
every
day
and
he
naturally
concludes
that
in
the
united
states
the
judges
are
important
political
functionaries
nevertheless
when
he
examines
the
nature
of
the
tribunals
they
offer
nothing
which
is
contrary
to
the
usual
habits
and
privileges
of
those
bodies
and
the
magistrates
seem
to
him
to
interfere
in
public
affairs
by
chance
but
by
a
chance
which
recurs
every
day
when
the
parliament
of
paris
remonstrated
or
refused
to
enregister
an
edict
or
when
it
summoned
a
functionary
accused
of
malversation
to
its
bar
its
political
influence
as
a
judicial
body
was
clearly
visible
but
nothing
of
the
kind
is
to
be
seen
in
the
united
states
the
americans
have
retained
all
the
ordinary
characteristics
of
judicial
authority
and
have
carefully
restricted
its
action
to
the
ordinary
circle
of
its
functions
the
first
characteristic
of
judicial
power
in
all
nations
is
the
duty
of
arbitration
but
rights
must
be
contested
in
order
to
warrant
the
interference
of
a
tribunal
and
an
action
must
be
brought
to
obtain
the
decision
of
a
judge
as
long
therefore
as
a
law
is
uncontested
the
judicial
authority
is
not
called
upon
to
discuss
it
and
it
may
exist
without
being
perceived
when
a
judge
in
a
given
case
attacks
a
law
relating
to
that
case
he
extends
the
circle
of
his
customary
duties
without
however
stepping
beyond
it
since
he
is
in
some
measure
obliged
to
decide
upon
the
law
in
order
to
decide
the
case
but
if
he
pronounces
upon
a
law
without
resting
upon
a
case
he
clearly
steps
beyond
his
sphere
and
invades
that
of
the
legislative
authority
the
second
characteristic
of
judicial
power
is
that
it
pronounces
on
special
cases
and
not
upon
general
principles
if
a
judge
in
deciding
a
particular
point
destroys
a
general
principle
by
passing
a
judgment
which
tends
to
reject
all
the
inferences
from
that
principle
and
consequently
to
annul
it
he
remains
within
the
ordinary
limits
of
his
functions
but
if
he
directly
attacks
a
general
principle
without
having
a
particular
case
in
view
he
leaves
the
circle
in
which
all
nations
have
agreed
to
confine
his
authority
he
assumes
a
more
important
and
perhaps
a
more
useful
influence
than
that
of
the
magistrate
but
he
ceases
to
represent
the
judicial
power
the
third
characteristic
of
the
judicial
power
is
its
inability
to
act
unless
it
is
appealed
to
or
until
it
has
taken
cognizance
of
an
affair
this
characteristic
is
less
general
than
the
other
two
but
notwithstanding
the
exceptions
i
think
it
may
be
regarded
as
essential
the
judicial
power
is
by
its
nature
devoid
of
action
it
must
be
put
in
motion
in
order
to
produce
a
result
when
it
is
called
upon
to
repress
a
crime
it
punishes
the
criminal
when
a
wrong
is
to
be
redressed
it
is
ready
to
redress
it
when
an
act
requires
interpretation
it
is
prepared
to
interpret
it
but
it
does
not
pursue
criminals
hunt
out
wrongs
or
examine
into
evidence
of
its
own
accord
a
judicial
functionary
who
should
open
proceedings
and
usurp
the
censorship
of
the
laws
would
in
some
measure
do
violence
to
the
passive
nature
of
his
authority
the
americans
have
retained
these
three
distinguishing
characteristics
of
the
judicial
power
an
american
judge
can
only
pronounce
a
decision
when
litigation
has
arisen
he
is
only
conversant
with
special
cases
and
he
can
not
act
until
the
cause
has
been
duly
brought
before
the
court
his
position
is
therefore
perfectly
similar
to
that
of
the
magistrate
of
other
nations
and
he
is
nevertheless
invested
with
immense
political
power
if
the
sphere
of
his
authority
and
his
means
of
action
are
the
same
as
those
of
other
judges
it
may
be
asked
whence
he
derives
a
power
which
they
do
not
possess
the
cause
of
this
difference
lies
in
the
simple
fact
that
the
americans
have
acknowledged
the
right
of
the
judges
to
found
their
decisions
on
the
constitution
rather
than
on
the
laws
in
other
words
they
have
left
them
at
liberty
not
to
apply
such
laws
as
may
appear
to
them
to
be
unconstitutional
i
am
aware
that
a
similar
right
has
been
claimed
but
claimed
in
vain
by
courts
of
justice
in
other
countries
but
in
america
it
is
recognized
by
all
the
authorities
and
not
a
party
nor
so
much
as
an
individual
is
found
to
contest
it
this
fact
can
only
be
explained
by
the
principles
of
the
american
constitution
in
france
the
constitution
is
or
at
least
is
supposed
to
be
immutable
and
the
received
theory
is
that
no
power
has
the
right
of
changing
any
part
of
it
in
england
the
parliament
has
an
acknowledged
right
to
modify
the
constitution
as
therefore
the
constitution
may
undergo
perpetual
changes
it
does
not
in
reality
exist
the
parliament
is
at
once
a
legislative
and
a
constituent
assembly
the
political
theories
of
america
are
more
simple
and
more
rational
an
american
constitution
is
not
supposed
to
be
immutable
as
in
france
nor
is
it
susceptible
of
modification
by
the
ordinary
powers
of
society
as
in
england
it
constitutes
a
detached
whole
which
as
it
represents
the
determination
of
the
whole
people
is
no
less
binding
on
the
legislator
than
on
the
private
citizen
but
which
may
be
altered
by
the
will
of
the
people
in
predetermined
cases
according
to
established
rules
in
america
the
constitution
may
therefore
vary
but
as
long
as
it
exists
it
is
the
origin
of
all
authority
and
the
sole
vehicle
of
the
predominating
force
it
is
easy
to
perceive
in
what
manner
these
differences
must
act
upon
the
position
and
the
rights
of
the
judicial
bodies
in
the
three
countries
i
have
cited
if
in
france
the
tribunals
were
authorized
to
disobey
the
laws
on
the
ground
of
their
being
opposed
to
the
constitution
the
supreme
power
would
in
fact
be
placed
in
their
hands
since
they
alone
would
have
the
right
of
interpreting
a
constitution
the
clauses
of
which
can
be
modified
by
no
authority
they
would
therefore
take
the
place
of
the
nation
and
exercise
as
absolute
a
sway
over
society
as
the
inherent
weakness
of
judicial
power
would
allow
them
to
do
undoubtedly
as
the
french
judges
are
incompetent
to
declare
a
law
to
be
unconstitutional
the
power
of
changing
the
constitution
is
indirectly
given
to
the
legislative
body
since
no
legal
barrier
would
oppose
the
alterations
which
it
might
prescribe
but
it
is
better
to
grant
the
power
of
changing
the
constitution
of
the
people
to
men
who
represent
however
imperfectly
the
will
of
the
people
than
to
men
who
represent
no
one
but
themselves
it
would
be
still
more
unreasonable
to
invest
the
english
judges
with
the
right
of
resisting
the
decisions
of
the
legislative
body
since
the
parliament
which
makes
the
laws
also
makes
the
constitution
and
consequently
a
law
emanating
from
the
three
powers
of
the
state
can
in
no
case
be
unconstitutional
but
neither
of
these
remarks
is
applicable
to
america
in
the
united
states
the
constitution
governs
the
legislator
as
much
as
the
private
citizen
as
it
is
the
first
of
laws
it
can
not
be
modified
by
a
law
and
it
is
therefore
just
that
the
tribunals
should
obey
the
constitution
in
preference
to
any
law
this
condition
is
essential
to
the
power
of
the
judicature
for
to
select
that
legal
obligation
by
which
he
is
most
strictly
bound
is
the
natural
right
of
every
magistrate
in
france
the
constitution
is
also
the
first
of
laws
and
the
judges
have
the
same
right
to
take
it
as
the
ground
of
their
decisions
but
were
they
to
exercise
this
right
they
must
perforce
encroach
on
rights
more
sacred
than
their
own
namely
on
those
of
society
in
whose
name
they
are
acting
in
this
case
the
state
motive
clearly
prevails
over
the
motives
of
an
individual
in
america
where
the
nation
can
always
reduce
its
magistrates
to
obedience
by
changing
its
constitution
no
danger
of
this
kind
is
to
be
feared
upon
this
point
therefore
the
political
and
the
logical
reason
agree
and
the
people
as
well
as
the
judges
preserve
their
privileges
whenever
a
law
which
the
judge
holds
to
be
unconstitutional
is
argued
in
a
tribunal
of
the
united
states
he
may
refuse
to
admit
it
as
a
rule
this
power
is
the
only
one
which
is
peculiar
to
the
american
magistrate
but
it
gives
rise
to
immense
political
influence
few
laws
can
escape
the
searching
analysis
for
there
are
few
which
are
not
prejudicial
to
some
private
interest
or
other
and
none
which
may
not
be
brought
before
a
court
of
justice
by
the
choice
of
parties
or
by
the
necessity
of
the
case
but
from
the
time
that
a
judge
has
refused
to
apply
any
given
law
in
a
case
that
law
loses
a
portion
of
its
moral
sanction
the
persons
to
whose
interest
it
is
prejudicial
learn
that
means
exist
of
evading
its
authority
and
similar
suits
are
multiplied
until
it
becomes
powerless
one
of
two
alternatives
must
then
be
resorted
to
the
people
must
alter
the
constitution
or
the
legislature
must
repeal
the
law
the
political
power
which
the
americans
have
intrusted
to
their
courts
of
justice
is
therefore
immense
but
the
evils
of
this
power
are
considerably
diminished
by
the
obligation
which
has
been
imposed
of
attacking
the
laws
through
the
courts
of
justice
alone
if
the
judge
had
been
empowered
to
contest
the
laws
on
the
ground
of
theoretical
generalities
if
he
had
been
enabled
to
open
an
attack
or
to
pass
a
censure
on
the
legislator
he
would
have
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
political
sphere
and
as
the
champion
or
the
antagonist
of
a
party
he
would
have
arrayed
the
hostile
passions
of
the
nation
in
the
conflict
but
when
a
judge
contests
a
law
applied
to
some
particular
case
in
an
obscure
proceeding
the
importance
of
his
attack
is
concealed
from
the
public
gaze
his
decision
bears
upon
the
interest
of
an
individual
and
if
the
law
is
slighted
it
is
only
collaterally
moreover
although
it
be
censured
it
is
not
abolished
its
moral
force
may
be
diminished
but
its
cogency
is
by
no
means
suspended
and
its
final
destruction
can
only
be
accomplished
by
the
reiterated
attacks
of
judicial
functionaries
it
will
readily
be
understood
that
by
connecting
the
censorship
of
the
laws
with
the
private
interests
of
members
of
the
community
and
by
intimately
uniting
the
prosecution
of
the
law
with
the
prosecution
of
an
individual
the
legislation
is
protected
from
wanton
assailants
and
from
the
daily
aggressions
of
party
spirit
the
errors
of
the
legislator
are
exposed
whenever
their
evil
consequences
are
most
felt
and
it
is
always
a
positive
and
appreciable
fact
which
serves
as
the
basis
of
a
prosecution
i
am
inclined
to
believe
this
practice
of
the
american
courts
to
be
at
once
the
most
favorable
to
liberty
as
well
as
to
public
order
if
the
judge
could
only
attack
the
legislator
openly
and
directly
he
would
sometimes
be
afraid
to
oppose
any
resistance
to
his
will
and
at
other
moments
party
spirit
might
encourage
him
to
brave
it
every
day
the
laws
would
consequently
be
attacked
when
the
power
from
which
they
emanate
is
weak
and
obeyed
when
it
is
strong
that
is
to
say
when
it
would
be
useful
to
respect
them
they
would
be
contested
and
when
it
would
be
easy
to
convert
them
into
an
instrument
of
oppression
they
would
be
respected
but
the
american
judge
is
brought
into
the
political
arena
independently
of
his
own
will
he
only
judges
the
law
because
he
is
obliged
to
judge
a
case
the
political
question
which
he
is
called
upon
to
resolve
is
connected
with
the
interest
of
the
parties
and
he
can
not
refuse
to
decide
it
without
abdicating
the
duties
of
his
post
he
performs
his
functions
as
a
citizen
by
fulfilling
the
strict
duties
which
belong
to
his
profession
as
a
magistrate
it
is
true
that
upon
this
system
the
judicial
censorship
which
is
exercised
by
the
courts
of
justice
over
the
legislation
can
not
extend
to
all
laws
indiscriminately
inasmuch
as
some
of
them
can
never
give
rise
to
that
precise
species
of
contestation
which
is
termed
a
lawsuit
and
even
when
such
a
contestation
is
possible
it
may
happen
that
no
one
cares
to
bring
it
before
a
court
of
justice
the
americans
have
often
felt
this
disadvantage
but
they
have
left
the
remedy
incomplete
lest
they
should
give
it
efficacy
which
in
some
cases
might
prove
dangerous
within
these
limits
the
power
vested
in
the
american
courts
of
justice
of
pronouncing
a
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
forms
one
of
the
most
powerful
barriers
which
have
ever
been
devised
against
the
tyranny
of
political
assemblies
other
powers
granted
to
the
american
judges
in
the
united
states
all
the
citizens
have
the
right
of
indicting
the
public
functionaries
before
the
ordinary
how
they
use
this
art
of
the
an
the
americans
and
the
english
can
not
understand
the
purport
of
this
clause
it
is
perfectly
natural
that
in
a
free
country
like
america
all
the
citizens
should
have
the
right
of
indicting
public
functionaries
before
the
ordinary
tribunals
and
that
all
the
judges
should
have
the
power
of
punishing
public
offences
the
right
granted
to
the
courts
of
justice
of
judging
the
agents
of
the
executive
government
when
they
have
violated
the
laws
is
so
natural
a
one
that
it
can
not
be
looked
upon
as
an
extraordinary
privilege
nor
do
the
springs
of
government
appear
to
me
to
be
weakened
in
the
united
states
by
the
custom
which
renders
all
public
officers
responsible
to
the
judges
of
the
land
the
americans
seem
on
the
contrary
to
have
increased
by
this
means
that
respect
which
is
due
to
the
authorities
and
at
the
same
time
to
have
rendered
those
who
are
in
power
more
scrupulous
of
offending
public
opinion
i
was
struck
by
the
small
number
of
political
trials
which
occur
in
the
united
states
but
i
have
no
difficulty
in
accounting
for
this
circumstance
a
lawsuit
of
whatever
nature
it
may
be
is
always
a
difficult
and
expensive
undertaking
it
is
easy
to
attack
a
public
man
in
a
journal
but
the
motives
which
can
warrant
an
action
at
law
must
be
serious
a
solid
ground
of
complaint
must
therefore
exist
to
induce
an
individual
to
prosecute
a
public
officer
and
public
officers
careful
not
to
furnish
these
grounds
of
complaint
when
they
are
afraid
of
being
prosecuted
this
does
not
depend
upon
the
republican
form
of
the
american
institutions
for
the
same
facts
present
themselves
in
england
these
two
nations
do
not
regard
the
impeachment
of
the
principal
officers
of
state
as
a
sufficient
guarantee
of
their
independence
but
they
hold
that
the
right
of
minor
prosecutions
which
are
within
the
reach
of
the
whole
community
is
a
better
pledge
of
freedom
than
those
great
judicial
actions
which
are
rarely
employed
until
it
is
too
late
in
the
middle
ages
when
it
was
very
difficult
to
overtake
offenders
the
judges
inflicted
the
most
dreadful
tortures
on
the
few
who
were
arrested
which
by
no
means
diminished
the
number
of
crimes
it
has
since
been
discovered
that
when
justice
is
more
certain
and
more
mild
it
is
at
the
same
time
more
efficacious
the
english
and
the
americans
hold
that
tyranny
and
oppression
are
to
be
treated
like
any
other
crime
by
lessening
the
penalty
and
facilitating
conviction
in
the
year
viii
of
the
french
republic
a
constitution
was
drawn
up
in
which
the
following
clause
was
introduced
art
all
the
agents
of
the
government
below
the
rank
of
ministers
can
only
be
prosecuted
for
offences
relating
to
their
several
functions
by
virtue
of
a
decree
of
the
conseil
in
which
case
the
prosecution
takes
place
before
the
ordinary
tribunals
this
clause
survived
the
constitution
de
and
it
is
still
maintained
in
spite
of
the
just
complaints
of
the
nation
i
have
always
found
the
utmost
difficulty
in
explaining
its
meaning
to
englishmen
or
americans
they
were
at
once
led
to
conclude
that
the
conseil
in
france
was
a
great
tribunal
established
in
the
centre
of
the
kingdom
which
exercised
a
preliminary
and
somewhat
tyrannical
jurisdiction
in
all
political
causes
but
when
i
told
them
that
the
conseil
was
not
a
judicial
body
in
the
common
sense
of
the
term
but
an
administrative
council
composed
of
men
dependent
on
the
crown
so
that
the
king
after
having
ordered
one
of
his
servants
called
a
prefect
to
commit
an
injustice
has
the
power
of
commanding
another
of
his
servants
called
a
councillor
of
state
to
prevent
the
former
from
being
punished
when
i
demonstrated
to
them
that
the
citizen
who
had
been
injured
by
the
order
of
the
sovereign
is
obliged
to
solicit
from
the
sovereign
permission
to
obtain
redress
they
refused
to
credit
so
flagrant
an
abuse
and
were
tempted
to
accuse
me
of
falsehood
or
of
ignorance
it
frequently
happened
before
the
revolution
that
a
parliament
issued
a
warrant
against
a
public
officer
who
had
committed
an
offence
and
sometimes
the
proceedings
were
annulled
by
the
authority
of
the
crown
despotism
then
displayed
itself
openly
and
obedience
was
extorted
by
force
we
have
then
retrograded
from
the
point
which
our
forefathers
had
reached
since
we
allow
things
to
pass
under
the
color
of
justice
and
the
sanction
of
the
law
which
violence
alone
could
impose
upon
them

political
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
definition
of
political
what
is
understood
by
political
jurisdiction
in
france
in
england
and
in
the
united
in
america
the
political
judge
can
only
pass
sentence
on
public
he
more
frequently
passes
a
sentence
of
removal
from
office
than
a
political
jurisdiction
as
it
exists
in
the
united
states
is
notwithstanding
its
mildness
and
perhaps
in
consequence
of
that
mildness
a
most
powerful
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
majority
i
understand
by
political
jurisdiction
that
temporary
right
of
pronouncing
a
legal
decision
with
which
a
political
body
may
be
invested
in
absolute
governments
no
utility
can
accrue
from
the
introduction
of
extraordinary
forms
of
procedure
the
prince
in
whose
name
an
offender
is
prosecuted
is
as
much
the
sovereign
of
the
courts
of
justice
as
of
everything
else
and
the
idea
which
is
entertained
of
his
power
is
of
itself
a
sufficient
security
the
only
thing
he
has
to
fear
is
that
the
external
formalities
of
justice
may
be
neglected
and
that
his
authority
may
be
dishonored
from
a
wish
to
render
it
more
absolute
but
in
most
free
countries
in
which
the
majority
can
never
exercise
the
same
influence
upon
the
tribunals
as
an
absolute
monarch
the
judicial
power
has
occasionally
been
vested
for
a
time
in
the
representatives
of
society
it
has
been
thought
better
to
introduce
a
temporary
confusion
between
the
functions
of
the
different
authorities
than
to
violate
the
necessary
principle
of
the
unity
of
government
england
france
and
the
united
states
have
established
this
political
jurisdiction
in
their
laws
and
it
is
curious
to
examine
the
different
use
which
these
three
great
nations
have
made
of
the
principle
in
england
and
in
france
the
house
of
lords
and
the
chambre
des
pairs
constitute
the
highest
criminal
court
of
their
respective
nations
and
although
they
do
not
habitually
try
all
political
offences
they
are
competent
to
try
them
all
another
political
body
enjoys
the
right
of
impeachment
before
the
house
of
lords
the
only
difference
which
exists
between
the
two
countries
in
this
respect
is
that
in
england
the
commons
may
impeach
whomsoever
they
please
before
the
lords
while
in
france
the
deputies
can
only
employ
this
mode
of
prosecution
against
the
ministers
of
the
crown
in
both
countries
the
upper
house
make
use
of
all
the
existing
penal
laws
of
the
nation
to
punish
the
delinquents
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
in
europe
one
branch
of
the
legislature
is
authorized
to
impeach
and
another
to
judge
the
house
of
representatives
arraigns
the
offender
and
the
senate
awards
his
sentence
but
the
senate
can
only
try
such
persons
as
are
brought
before
it
by
the
house
of
representatives
and
those
persons
must
belong
to
the
class
of
public
functionaries
thus
the
jurisdiction
of
the
senate
is
less
extensive
than
that
of
the
peers
of
france
while
the
right
of
impeachment
by
the
representatives
is
more
general
than
that
of
the
deputies
but
the
great
difference
which
exists
between
europe
and
america
is
that
in
europe
political
tribunals
are
empowered
to
inflict
all
the
dispositions
of
the
penal
code
while
in
america
when
they
have
deprived
the
offender
of
his
official
rank
and
have
declared
him
incapable
of
filling
any
political
office
for
the
future
their
jurisdiction
terminates
and
that
of
the
ordinary
tribunals
begins
suppose
for
instance
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
committed
the
crime
of
high
treason
the
house
of
representatives
impeaches
him
and
the
senate
degrades
him
he
must
then
be
tried
by
a
jury
which
alone
can
deprive
him
of
his
liberty
or
his
life
this
accurately
illustrates
the
subject
we
are
treating
the
political
jurisdiction
which
is
established
by
the
laws
of
europe
is
intended
to
try
great
offenders
whatever
may
be
their
birth
their
rank
or
their
powers
in
the
state
and
to
this
end
all
the
privileges
of
the
courts
of
justice
are
temporarily
extended
to
a
great
political
assembly
the
legislator
is
then
transformed
into
a
magistrate
he
is
called
upon
to
admit
to
distinguish
and
to
punish
the
offence
and
as
he
exercises
all
the
authority
of
a
judge
the
law
restricts
him
to
the
observance
of
all
the
duties
of
that
high
office
and
of
all
the
formalities
of
justice
when
a
public
functionary
is
impeached
before
an
english
or
a
french
political
tribunal
and
is
found
guilty
the
sentence
deprives
him
of
his
functions
and
it
may
pronounce
him
to
be
incapable
of
resuming
them
or
any
others
for
the
future
but
in
this
case
the
political
interdict
is
a
consequence
of
the
sentence
and
not
the
sentence
itself
in
europe
the
sentence
of
a
political
tribunal
is
therefore
to
be
regarded
as
a
judicial
verdict
rather
than
as
an
administrative
measure
in
the
united
states
the
contrary
takes
place
and
although
the
decision
of
the
senate
is
judicial
in
its
form
since
the
senators
are
obliged
to
comply
with
the
practices
and
formalities
of
a
court
of
justice
although
it
is
judicial
in
respect
to
the
motives
on
which
it
is
founded
since
the
senate
is
in
general
obliged
to
take
an
offence
at
common
law
as
the
basis
of
its
sentence
nevertheless
the
object
of
the
proceeding
is
purely
administrative
if
it
had
been
the
intention
of
the
american
legislator
to
invest
a
political
body
with
great
judicial
authority
its
action
would
not
have
been
limited
to
the
circle
of
public
functionaries
since
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
the
state
may
be
in
the
possession
of
no
functions
at
all
and
this
is
especially
true
in
republics
where
party
favor
is
the
first
of
authorities
and
where
the
strength
of
many
a
leader
is
increased
by
his
exercising
no
legal
power
if
it
had
been
the
intention
of
the
american
legislator
to
give
society
the
means
of
repressing
state
offences
by
exemplary
punishment
according
to
the
practice
of
ordinary
judgment
the
resources
of
the
penal
code
would
all
have
been
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
political
tribunals
but
the
weapon
with
which
they
are
intrusted
is
an
imperfect
one
and
it
can
never
reach
the
most
dangerous
offenders
since
men
who
aim
at
the
entire
subversion
of
the
laws
are
not
likely
to
murmur
at
a
political
interdict
the
main
object
of
the
political
jurisdiction
which
obtains
in
the
united
states
is
therefore
to
deprive
the
citizen
of
an
authority
which
he
has
used
amiss
and
to
prevent
him
from
ever
acquiring
it
again
this
is
evidently
an
administrative
measure
sanctioned
by
the
formalities
of
judicial
investigation
in
this
matter
the
americans
have
created
a
mixed
system
they
have
surrounded
the
act
which
removes
a
public
functionary
with
the
securities
of
a
political
trial
and
they
have
deprived
all
political
condemnations
of
their
severest
penalties
every
link
of
the
system
may
easily
be
traced
from
this
point
we
at
once
perceive
why
the
american
constitutions
subject
all
the
civil
functionaries
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
senate
while
the
military
whose
crimes
are
nevertheless
more
formidable
are
exempt
from
that
tribunal
in
the
civil
service
none
of
the
american
functionaries
can
be
said
to
be
removeable
the
places
which
some
of
them
occupy
are
inalienable
and
the
others
derive
their
rights
from
a
power
which
can
not
be
abrogated
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
try
them
all
in
order
to
deprive
them
of
their
authority
but
military
officers
are
dependent
on
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
state
who
is
himself
a
civil
functionary
and
the
decision
which
condemns
him
is
a
blow
upon
them
all
if
we
now
compare
the
american
and
european
systems
we
shall
meet
with
differences
no
less
striking
in
the
different
effects
which
each
of
them
produces
or
may
produce
in
france
and
in
england
the
jurisdiction
of
political
bodies
is
looked
upon
as
an
extraordinary
resource
which
is
only
to
be
employed
in
order
to
rescue
society
from
unwonted
dangers
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
these
tribunals
as
they
are
constituted
in
europe
are
apt
to
violate
the
conservative
principle
of
the
balance
of
power
in
the
state
and
to
threaten
incessantly
the
lives
and
liberties
of
the
subject
the
same
political
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
is
only
indirectly
hostile
to
the
balance
of
power
it
can
not
menace
the
lives
of
the
citizens
and
it
does
not
hover
as
in
europe
over
the
heads
of
the
community
since
those
only
who
have
submitted
to
its
authority
upon
accepting
office
are
exposed
to
its
severity
it
is
at
the
same
time
less
formidable
and
less
efficacious
indeed
it
has
not
been
considered
by
the
legislators
of
the
united
states
as
a
remedy
for
the
more
violent
evils
of
society
but
as
an
ordinary
means
of
conducting
the
government
in
this
respect
it
probably
exercises
more
real
influence
on
the
social
body
in
america
than
in
europe
we
must
not
be
misled
by
the
apparent
mildness
of
the
american
legislation
in
all
that
relates
to
political
jurisdiction
it
is
to
be
observed
in
the
first
place
that
in
the
united
states
the
tribunal
which
passes
sentence
is
composed
of
the
same
elements
and
subject
to
the
same
influences
as
the
body
which
impeaches
the
offender
and
that
this
uniformity
gives
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
the
vindictive
passions
of
parties
if
political
judges
in
the
united
states
can
not
inflict
such
heavy
penalties
as
those
of
europe
there
is
the
less
chance
of
their
acquitting
a
prisoner
and
the
conviction
if
it
is
less
formidable
is
more
certain
the
principal
object
of
the
political
tribunals
of
europe
is
to
punish
the
offender
the
purpose
of
those
in
america
is
to
deprive
him
of
his
authority
a
political
condemnation
in
the
united
states
may
therefore
be
looked
upon
as
a
preventive
measure
and
there
is
no
reason
for
restricting
the
judges
to
the
exact
definitions
of
criminal
law
nothing
can
be
more
alarming
than
the
excessive
latitude
with
which
political
offences
are
described
in
the
laws
of
america
article
section
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
runs
thus
the
president
and
all
the
civil
officers
of
the
united
states
shall
be
removed
from
office
on
impeachment
for
and
conviction
of
treason
bribery
other
high
crimes
and
many
of
the
constitutions
of
the
states
are
even
less
explicit
public
officers
says
the
constitution
of
massachusetts
shall
be
impeached
for
misconduct
or
the
constitution
of
virginia
declares
that
all
the
civil
officers
who
shall
have
offended
against
the
state
by
corruption
or
other
high
crimes
may
be
impeached
by
the
house
of
delegates
in
some
constitutions
no
offences
are
specified
in
order
to
subject
the
public
functionaries
to
an
unlimited
responsibility
but
i
will
venture
to
affirm
that
it
is
precisely
their
mildness
which
renders
the
american
laws
most
formidable
in
this
respect
we
have
shown
that
in
europe
the
removal
of
a
functionary
and
his
political
interdiction
are
consequences
of
the
penalty
he
is
to
undergo
and
that
in
america
they
constitute
the
penalty
itself
the
result
is
that
in
europe
political
tribunals
are
invested
with
rights
which
they
are
afraid
to
use
and
that
the
fear
of
punishing
too
much
hinders
them
from
punishing
at
all
but
in
america
no
one
hesitates
to
inflict
a
penalty
from
which
humanity
does
not
recoil
to
condemn
a
political
opponent
to
death
in
order
to
deprive
him
of
his
power
is
to
commit
what
all
the
world
would
execrate
as
a
horrible
assassination
but
to
declare
that
opponent
unworthy
to
exercise
that
authority
to
deprive
him
of
it
and
to
leave
him
uninjured
in
life
and
liberty
may
appear
to
be
the
fair
issue
of
the
struggle
but
this
sentence
which
is
so
easy
to
pronounce
is
not
the
less
fatally
severe
to
the
majority
of
those
upon
whom
it
is
inflicted
great
criminals
may
undoubtedly
brave
its
intangible
rigor
but
ordinary
offenders
will
dread
it
as
a
condemnation
which
destroys
their
position
in
the
world
casts
a
blight
upon
their
honor
and
condemns
them
to
a
shameful
inactivity
worse
than
death
the
influence
exercised
in
the
united
states
upon
the
progress
of
society
by
the
jurisdiction
of
political
bodies
may
not
appear
to
be
formidable
but
it
is
only
the
more
immense
it
does
not
act
directly
upon
the
governed
but
it
renders
the
majority
more
absolute
over
those
who
govern
it
does
not
confer
an
unbounded
authority
on
the
legislator
which
can
only
be
exerted
at
some
momentous
crisis
but
it
establishes
a
temperate
and
regular
influence
which
is
at
all
times
available
if
the
power
is
decreased
it
can
on
the
other
hand
be
more
conveniently
employed
and
more
easily
abused
by
preventing
political
tribunals
from
inflicting
judicial
punishments
the
americans
seem
to
have
eluded
the
worst
consequences
of
legislative
tyranny
rather
than
tyranny
itself
and
i
am
not
sure
that
political
jurisdiction
as
it
is
constituted
in
the
united
states
is
not
the
most
formidable
which
has
ever
been
placed
in
the
rude
grasp
of
a
popular
majority
when
the
american
republics
begin
to
degenerate
it
will
be
easy
to
verify
the
truth
of
this
observation
by
remarking
whether
the
number
of
political
impeachments
augments

same
religion
the
same
language
the
same
customs
and
almost
the
same
laws
they
were
struggling
against
a
common
enemy
and
these
reasons
were
sufficiently
strong
to
unite
them
one
to
another
and
to
consolidate
them
into
one
nation
but
as
each
of
them
had
enjoyed
a
separate
existence
and
a
government
within
its
own
control
the
peculiar
interests
and
customs
which
resulted
from
this
system
were
opposed
to
a
compact
and
intimate
union
which
would
have
absorbed
the
individual
importance
of
each
in
the
general
importance
of
all
hence
arose
two
opposite
tendencies
the
one
prompting
the
to
unite
the
other
to
divide
their
strength
as
long
as
the
war
with
the
lasted
the
principle
of
union
was
kept
alive
by
necessity
and
although
the
laws
which
constituted
it
were
defective
the
common
tie
subsisted
in
spite
of
their
imperfections
but
no
sooner
was
peace
concluded
than
the
faults
of
the
legislation
became
manifest
and
the
state
seemed
to
be
suddenly
dissolved
each
colony
became
an
independent
republic
and
assumed
an
absolute
sovereignty
the
federal
government
condemned
to
impotence
by
its
constitution
and
no
longer
sustained
by
the
presence
of
a
common
danger
saw
the
outrages
offered
to
its
flag
by
the
great
nations
of
europe
while
it
was
scarcely
able
to
maintain
its
ground
against
the
indian
tribes
and
to
pay
the
interest
of
the
debt
which
had
been
contracted
during
the
war
of
independence
it
was
already
on
the
verge
of
destruction
when
it
officially
proclaimed
its
inability
to
conduct
the
government
and
appealed
to
the
constituent
authority
of
the
nation
if
america
ever
approached
for
however
brief
a
time
that
lofty
pinnacle
of
glory
to
which
the
proud
fancy
of
its
inhabitants
is
wont
to
point
it
was
at
the
solemn
moment
at
which
the
power
of
the
nation
abdicated
as
it
were
the
empire
of
the
land
all
ages
have
furnished
the
spectacle
of
a
people
struggling
with
energy
to
win
its
independence
and
the
efforts
of
the
americans
in
throwing
off
the
english
yoke
have
been
considerably
exaggerated
separated
from
their
enemies
by
three
thousand
miles
of
ocean
and
backed
by
a
powerful
ally
the
success
of
the
united
states
may
be
more
justly
attributed
to
their
geographical
position
than
to
the
valor
of
their
armies
or
the
patriotism
of
their
citizens
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
compare
the
american
war
to
the
wars
of
the
french
revolution
or
the
efforts
of
the
americans
to
those
of
the
french
who
when
they
were
attacked
by
the
whole
of
europe
without
credit
and
without
allies
were
still
capable
of
opposing
a
twentieth
part
of
their
population
to
their
foes
and
of
bearing
the
torch
of
revolution
beyond
their
frontiers
while
they
stifled
its
devouring
flame
within
the
bosom
of
their
country
but
it
is
a
novelty
in
the
history
of
society
to
see
a
great
people
turn
a
calm
and
scrutinizing
eye
upon
itself
when
apprised
by
the
legislature
that
the
wheels
of
government
had
stopped
to
see
it
carefully
examine
the
extent
of
the
evil
and
patiently
wait
for
two
whole
years
until
a
remedy
was
discovered
which
it
voluntarily
adopted
without
having
wrung
a
tear
or
a
drop
of
blood
from
mankind
at
the
time
when
the
inadequacy
of
the
first
constitution
was
discovered
america
possessed
the
double
advantage
of
that
calm
which
had
succeeded
the
effervescence
of
the
revolution
and
of
those
great
men
who
had
led
the
revolution
to
a
successful
issue
the
assembly
which
accepted
the
task
of
composing
the
second
constitution
was
small
but
george
washington
was
its
president
and
it
contained
the
choicest
talents
and
the
noblest
hearts
which
had
ever
appeared
in
the
new
world
this
national
commission
after
long
and
mature
deliberation
offered
to
the
acceptance
of
the
people
the
body
of
general
laws
which
still
rules
the
union
all
the
states
adopted
it
successively
the
new
federal
government
commenced
its
functions
in
after
an
interregnum
of
two
years
the
revolution
of
america
terminated
when
that
of
france
began
summary
of
the
federal
constitution
division
of
authority
between
the
federal
government
and
the
the
government
of
the
states
is
the
rule
the
federal
government
the
exception
the
first
question
which
awaited
the
americans
was
intricate
and
by
no
means
easy
of
solution
the
object
was
so
to
divide
the
authority
of
the
different
states
which
composed
the
union
that
each
of
them
should
continue
to
govern
itself
in
all
that
concerned
its
internal
prosperity
while
the
entire
nation
represented
by
the
union
should
continue
to
form
a
compact
body
and
to
provide
for
the
exigencies
of
the
people
it
was
as
impossible
to
determine
beforehand
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
the
share
of
authority
which
each
of
the
two
governments
was
to
enjoy
as
to
foresee
all
the
incidents
in
the
existence
of
a
nation
the
obligations
and
the
claims
of
the
federal
government
were
simple
and
easily
definable
because
the
union
had
been
formed
with
the
express
purpose
of
meeting
the
general
exigencies
of
the
people
but
the
claims
and
obligations
of
the
states
were
on
the
other
hand
complicated
and
various
because
those
governments
penetrated
into
all
the
details
of
social
life
the
attributes
of
the
federal
government
were
therefore
carefully
enumerated
and
all
that
was
not
included
among
them
was
declared
to
constitute
a
part
of
the
privileges
of
the
several
governments
of
the
states
thus
the
government
of
the
states
remained
the
rule
and
that
of
the
confederation
became
the
exception
but
as
it
was
foreseen
that
in
practice
questions
might
arise
as
to
the
exact
limits
of
this
exceptional
authority
and
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
submit
these
questions
to
the
decision
of
the
ordinary
courts
of
justice
established
in
the
states
by
the
states
themselves
a
high
federal
court
was
created
which
was
destined
among
other
functions
to
maintain
the
balance
of
power
which
had
been
established
by
the
constitution
between
the
two
rival
governments
prerogative
of
the
federal
government
power
of
declaring
war
making
peace
and
levying
general
taxes
vested
in
the
federal
what
part
of
the
internal
policy
of
the
country
it
may
the
government
of
the
union
in
some
respects
more
central
than
the
king
government
in
the
old
french
monarchy
the
external
relations
of
a
people
may
be
compared
to
those
of
private
individuals
and
they
can
not
be
advantageously
maintained
without
the
agency
of
the
single
head
of
a
government
the
exclusive
right
of
making
peace
and
war
of
concluding
treaties
of
commerce
of
raising
armies
and
equipping
fleets
was
therefore
granted
to
the
union
the
necessity
of
a
national
government
was
less
imperiously
felt
in
the
conduct
of
the
internal
affairs
of
society
but
there
are
certain
general
interests
which
can
only
be
attended
to
with
advantage
by
a
general
authority
the
union
was
invested
with
the
power
of
controlling
the
monetary
system
of
directing
the
and
of
opening
the
great
roads
which
were
to
establish
communication
between
the
different
parts
of
the
country
the
independence
of
the
government
of
each
state
was
formally
recognized
in
its
sphere
nevertheless
the
federal
government
was
authorized
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
the
states
in
a
few
predetermined
cases
in
which
an
indiscreet
abuse
of
their
independence
might
compromise
the
security
of
the
union
at
large
thus
while
the
power
of
modifying
and
changing
their
legislation
at
pleasure
was
preserved
in
all
the
republics
they
were
forbidden
to
enact
post
laws
or
to
create
a
class
of
nobles
in
their
community
lastly
as
it
was
necessary
that
the
federal
government
should
be
able
to
fulfil
its
engagements
it
was
endowed
with
an
unlimited
power
of
levying
taxes
in
examining
the
balance
of
power
as
established
by
the
federal
constitution
in
remarking
on
the
one
hand
the
portion
of
sovereignty
which
has
been
reserved
to
the
several
states
and
on
the
other
the
share
of
power
which
the
union
has
assumed
it
is
evident
that
the
federal
legislators
entertained
the
clearest
and
most
accurate
notions
on
the
nature
of
the
centralisation
of
government
the
united
states
form
not
only
a
republic
but
a
confederation
nevertheless
the
authority
of
the
nation
is
more
central
than
it
was
in
several
of
the
monarchies
of
europe
when
the
american
constitution
was
formed
take
for
instance
the
two
following
examples
thirteen
supreme
courts
of
justice
existed
in
france
which
generally
speaking
had
the
right
of
interpreting
the
law
without
appeal
and
those
provinces
styled
were
authorized
to
refuse
their
assent
to
an
impost
which
had
been
levied
by
the
sovereign
who
represented
the
nation
in
the
union
there
is
but
one
tribunal
to
interpret
as
there
is
one
legislature
to
make
the
laws
and
an
impost
voted
by
the
representatives
of
the
nation
is
binding
upon
all
the
citizens
in
these
two
essential
points
therefore
the
union
exercises
more
central
authority
than
the
french
monarchy
possessed
although
the
union
is
only
an
assemblage
of
confederate
republics
in
spain
certain
provinces
had
the
right
of
establishing
a
system
of
customhouse
duties
peculiar
to
themselves
although
that
privilege
belongs
by
its
very
nature
to
the
national
sovereignty
in
america
the
congress
alone
has
the
right
of
regulating
the
commercial
relations
of
the
states
the
government
of
the
confederation
is
therefore
more
centralized
in
this
respect
than
the
kingdom
of
spain
it
is
true
that
the
power
of
the
crown
in
france
or
in
spain
was
always
able
to
obtain
by
force
whatever
the
constitution
of
the
country
denied
and
that
the
ultimate
result
was
consequently
the
same
and
i
am
here
discussing
the
theory
of
the
constitution
federal
powers
after
having
settled
the
limits
within
which
the
federal
government
was
to
act
the
next
point
was
to
determine
the
powers
which
it
was
to
exert
legislative
powers
division
of
the
legislative
body
into
two
difference
in
the
manner
of
forming
the
two
the
principle
of
the
independence
of
the
states
predominates
in
the
formation
of
the
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
nation
in
the
composition
of
the
house
of
singular
effects
of
the
fact
that
a
constitution
can
only
be
logical
in
the
early
stages
of
a
nation
the
plan
which
had
been
laid
down
beforehand
for
the
constitution
of
the
several
states
was
followed
in
many
points
in
the
organization
of
the
powers
of
the
union
the
federal
legislature
of
the
union
was
composed
of
a
senate
and
a
house
of
representatives
a
spirit
of
conciliation
prescribed
the
observance
of
distinct
principles
in
the
formation
of
each
of
these
two
assemblies
i
have
already
shown
that
two
contrary
interests
were
opposed
to
each
other
in
the
establishment
of
the
federal
constitution
these
two
interests
had
given
rise
to
two
opinions
it
was
the
wish
of
one
party
to
convert
the
union
into
a
league
of
independent
states
or
a
sort
of
congress
at
which
the
representatives
of
the
several
peoples
would
meet
to
discuss
certain
points
of
their
common
interests
the
other
party
desired
to
unite
the
inhabitants
of
the
american
colonies
into
one
sole
nation
and
to
establish
a
government
which
should
act
as
the
sole
representative
of
the
nation
as
far
as
the
limited
sphere
of
its
authority
would
permit
the
practical
consequences
of
these
two
theories
were
exceedingly
different
the
question
was
whether
a
league
was
to
be
established
instead
of
a
national
government
whether
the
majority
of
the
states
instead
of
a
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
union
was
to
give
the
law
for
every
state
the
small
as
well
as
the
great
then
retained
the
character
of
an
independent
power
and
entered
the
union
upon
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
if
on
the
contrary
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
were
to
be
considered
as
belonging
to
one
and
the
same
nation
it
was
natural
that
the
majority
of
the
citizens
of
the
union
should
prescribe
the
law
of
course
the
lesser
states
could
not
subscribe
to
the
application
of
this
doctrine
without
in
fact
abdicating
their
existence
in
relation
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
confederation
since
they
would
have
passed
from
the
condition
of
a
and
authority
to
that
of
an
insignificant
fraction
of
a
great
people
the
former
system
would
have
invested
them
with
an
excessive
authority
the
latter
would
have
annulled
their
influence
altogether
under
these
circumstances
the
result
was
that
the
strict
rules
of
logic
were
evaded
as
is
usually
the
case
when
interests
are
opposed
to
arguments
a
middle
course
was
hit
upon
by
the
legislators
which
brought
together
by
force
two
systems
theoretically
irreconcilable
the
principle
of
the
independence
of
the
states
prevailed
in
the
formation
of
the
senate
and
that
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
nation
predominated
in
the
composition
of
the
house
of
representatives
it
was
decided
that
each
state
should
send
two
senators
to
congress
and
a
number
of
representatives
proportioned
to
its
population
it
results
from
this
arrangement
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
at
the
present
day
forty
representatives
and
only
two
senators
the
state
of
delaware
has
two
senators
and
only
one
representative
the
state
of
delaware
is
therefore
equal
to
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
senate
while
the
latter
has
forty
times
the
influence
of
the
former
in
the
house
of
representatives
thus
if
the
minority
of
the
nation
preponderates
in
the
senate
it
may
paralyze
the
decisions
of
the
majority
represented
in
the
other
house
which
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
constitutional
government
the
facts
show
how
rare
and
how
difficult
it
is
rationally
and
logically
to
combine
all
the
several
parts
of
legislation
in
the
course
of
time
different
interests
arise
and
different
principles
are
sanctioned
by
the
same
people
and
when
a
general
constitution
is
to
be
established
these
interests
and
principles
are
so
many
natural
obstacles
to
the
rigorous
application
of
any
political
system
with
all
its
consequences
the
early
stages
of
national
existence
are
the
only
periods
at
which
it
is
possible
to
maintain
the
complete
logic
of
legislation
and
when
we
perceive
a
nation
in
the
enjoyment
of
this
advantage
before
we
hasten
to
conclude
that
it
is
wise
we
should
do
well
to
remember
that
it
is
young
when
the
federal
constitution
was
formed
the
interest
of
independence
for
the
separate
states
and
the
interest
of
union
for
the
whole
people
were
the
only
two
conflicting
interests
which
existed
among
the
and
a
compromise
was
necessarily
made
between
them
it
is
however
just
to
acknowledge
that
this
part
of
the
constitution
has
not
hitherto
produced
those
evils
which
might
have
been
feared
all
the
states
are
young
and
contiguous
their
customs
their
ideas
and
their
wants
are
not
dissimilar
and
the
differences
which
result
from
their
size
or
inferiority
do
not
suffice
to
set
their
interests
at
variance
the
small
states
have
consequently
never
been
induced
to
league
themselves
together
in
the
senate
to
oppose
the
designs
of
the
larger
ones
and
indeed
there
is
so
irresistible
an
authority
in
the
legitimate
expression
of
the
will
of
a
people
that
the
senate
could
offer
but
a
feeble
opposition
to
the
vote
of
the
majority
of
the
house
of
representatives
it
must
not
be
forgotten
on
the
other
hand
that
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
the
american
legislators
to
reduce
to
a
single
nation
the
people
for
whom
they
were
making
laws
the
object
of
the
federal
constitution
was
not
to
destroy
the
independence
of
the
states
but
to
restrain
it
by
acknowledging
the
real
authority
of
these
secondary
communities
and
it
was
impossible
to
deprive
them
of
it
they
disavowed
beforehand
the
habitual
use
of
constraint
in
enforcing
the
decisions
of
the
majority
upon
this
principle
the
introduction
of
the
influence
of
the
states
into
the
mechanism
of
the
federal
government
was
by
no
means
to
be
wondered
at
since
it
only
attested
the
existence
of
an
acknowledged
power
which
was
to
be
humored
and
not
forcibly
checked
a
farther
difference
between
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
the
senate
named
by
the
provincial
legislature
the
representatives
by
the
double
election
of
the
former
single
election
of
the
term
of
the
different
peculiar
functions
of
each
house
the
senate
not
only
differs
from
the
other
house
in
the
principle
which
it
represents
but
also
in
the
mode
of
its
election
in
the
term
for
which
it
is
chosen
and
in
the
nature
of
its
functions
the
house
of
representatives
is
named
by
the
people
the
senate
by
the
legislators
of
each
state
the
former
is
directly
elected
the
latter
is
elected
by
an
elected
body
the
term
for
which
the
representatives
are
chosen
is
only
two
years
that
of
the
senators
is
six
the
functions
of
the
house
of
representatives
are
purely
legislative
and
the
only
share
it
takes
in
the
judicial
power
is
in
the
impeachment
of
public
officers
the
senate
in
the
work
of
legislation
and
tries
those
political
offences
which
the
house
of
representatives
submits
to
its
decision
it
also
acts
as
the
great
executive
council
of
the
nation
the
treaties
which
are
concluded
by
the
president
must
be
ratified
by
the
senate
and
the
appointments
he
may
make
must
be
definitively
approved
by
the
same
body
the
executive
power
dependence
of
the
president
he
is
elective
and
he
is
free
to
act
in
his
own
sphere
under
the
inspection
but
not
under
the
direction
of
the
his
salary
fixed
at
his
entry
into
suspensive
veto
the
american
legislators
undertook
a
difficult
task
in
attempting
to
create
an
executive
power
dependent
on
the
majority
of
the
people
and
nevertheless
sufficiently
strong
to
act
without
restraint
in
its
own
sphere
it
was
indispensable
to
the
maintenance
of
the
republican
form
of
government
that
the
representatives
of
the
executive
power
should
be
subject
to
the
will
of
the
nation
the
president
is
an
elective
magistrate
his
honor
his
property
his
liberty
and
his
life
are
the
securities
which
the
people
has
for
the
temperate
use
of
his
power
but
in
the
exercise
of
his
authority
he
can
not
be
said
to
be
perfectly
independent
the
senate
takes
cognizance
of
his
relations
with
foreign
powers
and
of
the
distribution
of
public
appointments
so
that
he
can
neither
be
bribed
nor
can
he
employ
the
means
of
corruption
the
legislators
of
the
union
acknowledged
that
the
executive
power
would
be
incompetent
to
fulfill
its
task
with
dignity
and
utility
unless
it
enjoyed
a
greater
degree
of
stability
and
of
strength
than
had
been
granted
to
it
in
the
separate
states
the
president
is
chosen
for
four
years
and
he
may
be
so
that
the
chances
of
a
prolonged
administration
may
inspire
him
with
hopeful
undertakings
for
the
public
good
and
with
the
means
of
carrying
them
into
execution
the
president
was
made
the
sole
representative
of
the
executive
power
of
the
union
and
care
was
taken
not
to
render
his
decisions
subordinate
to
the
vote
of
a
council
a
dangerous
measure
which
tends
at
the
same
time
to
clog
the
action
of
the
government
and
to
diminish
its
responsibility
the
senate
has
the
right
of
annulling
certain
acts
of
the
president
but
it
can
not
compel
him
to
take
any
steps
nor
does
it
participate
in
the
exercise
of
the
executive
power
the
action
of
the
legislature
on
the
executive
power
may
be
direct
and
we
have
just
shown
that
the
americans
carefully
obviated
this
influence
but
it
may
on
the
other
hand
be
indirect
public
assemblies
which
have
the
power
of
depriving
an
officer
of
state
of
his
salary
encroach
upon
his
independence
and
as
they
are
free
to
make
the
laws
it
is
to
be
feared
lest
they
should
gradually
appropriate
to
themselves
a
portion
of
that
authority
which
the
constitution
had
vested
in
his
hands
this
dependence
of
the
executive
power
is
one
of
the
defects
inherent
in
republican
constitutions
the
americans
have
not
been
able
to
counteract
the
tendency
which
legislative
assemblies
have
to
get
possession
of
the
government
but
they
have
rendered
this
propensity
less
irresistible
the
salary
of
the
president
is
fixed
at
the
time
of
his
entering
upon
office
for
the
whole
period
of
his
magistracy
the
president
is
moreover
provided
with
a
suspensive
veto
which
allows
him
to
oppose
the
passing
of
such
laws
as
might
destroy
the
portion
of
independence
which
the
constitution
awards
him
the
struggle
between
the
president
and
the
legislature
must
always
be
an
unequal
one
since
the
latter
is
certain
of
bearing
down
all
resistance
by
persevering
in
its
plans
but
the
suspensive
veto
forces
it
at
least
to
reconsider
the
matter
and
if
the
motion
be
persisted
in
it
must
then
be
backed
by
a
majority
of
of
the
whole
house
the
veto
is
in
fact
a
sort
of
appeal
to
the
people
the
executive
power
which
without
this
security
might
have
been
secretly
oppressed
adopts
this
means
of
pleading
its
cause
and
stating
its
motives
but
if
the
legislature
is
certain
of
overpowering
all
resistance
by
persevering
in
its
plans
i
reply
that
in
the
constitutions
of
all
nations
of
whatever
kind
they
may
be
a
certain
point
exists
at
which
the
legislator
is
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
the
good
sense
and
the
virtue
of
his
this
point
is
more
prominent
and
more
discoverable
in
republics
while
it
is
more
remote
and
more
carefully
concealed
in
monarchies
but
it
always
exists
somewhere
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
in
which
everything
can
be
provided
for
by
the
laws
or
in
which
political
institutions
can
prove
a
substitute
for
common
sense
and
public
morality
difference
between
the
position
of
the
president
of
the
united

and
that
of

notwithstanding
these
discrepancies
france
is
more
akin

than
the

to
a
comparison
of
the
number
of
public
officers
depending
upon
the
executive
power
in
the
two
countries
the
executive
power
has
so
important
an
influence
on
the
destinies
of
nations
that
i
am
inclined
to
pause
for
an
instant
at
this
portion
of
my
subject
in
order
more
clearly
to
explain
the
part
it
sustains
in
america
in
order
to
form
an
accurate
idea
of
the
position
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
it
may
not
be
irrelevant
to
compare
it
to
that
of
one
of
the
constitutional
kings
of
europe
in
this
comparison
i
shall
pay
but
little
attention
to
the
external
signs
of
power
which
are
more
apt
to
deceive
the
eye
of
the
observer
than
to
guide
his
researches
when
a
monarchy
is
being
gradually
transformed
into
a
republic
the
executive
power
retains
the
titles
the
honors
the
etiquette
and
even
the
funds
of
royalty
long
after
its
authority
has
disappeared
the
english
after
having
cut
off
the
head
of
one
king
and
expelled
another
from
his
throne
were
accustomed
to
accost
the
successors
of
those
princes
upon
their
knees
on
the
other
hand
when
a
republic
falls
under
the
sway
of
a
single
individual
the
demeanor
of
the
sovereign
is
simple
and
unpretending
as
if
his
authority
was
not
yet
paramount
when
the
emperors
exercised
an
unlimited
control
over
the
fortunes
and
the
lives
of
their
it
was
customary
to
call
them
caesar
in
conversation
and
they
were
in
the
habit
of
supping
without
formality
at
their
friends
houses
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
look
below
the
surface
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
is
shared
between
the
union
and
the
states
while
in
france
it
is
undivided
and
compact
hence
arises
the
first
and
the
most
notable
difference
which
exists
between
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
king
of
france
in
the
united
states
the
executive
power
is
as
limited
and
partial
as
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
in
whose
name
it
acts
in
france
it
is
as
universal
as
the
authority
of
the
state
the
americans
have
a
federal
and
the
french
a
national
government
the
first
cause
of
inferiority
results
from
the
nature
of
things
but
it
is
not
the
only
one
the
second
in
importance
is
as
follows
sovereignty
may
be
defined
to
be
the
right
of
making
laws
in
france
the
king
really
exercises
a
portion
of
the
sovereign
power
since
the
laws
have
no
weight
till
he
has
given
his
assent
to
them
he
is
moreover
the
executor
of
all
they
ordain
the
president
is
also
the
executor
of
the
laws
but
he
does
not
really
in
their
formation
since
the
refusal
of
his
assent
does
not
annul
them
he
is
therefore
merely
to
be
considered
as
the
agent
of
the
sovereign
power
but
not
only
does
the
king
of
france
exercise
a
portion
of
the
sovereign
power
he
also
contributes
to
the
nomination
of
the
legislature
which
exercises
the
other
portion
he
has
the
privilege
of
appointing
the
members
of
one
chamber
and
of
dissolving
the
other
at
his
pleasure
whereas
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
no
share
in
the
formation
of
the
legislative
body
and
can
not
dissolve
any
part
of
it
the
king
has
the
same
right
of
bringing
forward
measures
as
the
chambers
a
right
which
the
president
does
not
possess
the
king
is
represented
in
each
assembly
by
his
ministers
who
explain
his
intentions
support
his
opinions
and
maintain
the
principles
of
the
government
the
president
and
his
ministers
are
alike
excluded
from
congress
so
that
his
influence
and
his
opinions
can
only
penetrate
indirectly
into
that
great
body
the
king
of
france
is
therefore
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
legislature
which
can
no
more
act
without
him
than
he
can
without
it
the
president
exercises
an
authority
inferior
to
and
depending
upon
that
of
the
legislature
even
in
the
exercise
of
the
executive
power
properly
so
called
the
point
upon
which
his
position
seems
to
be
almost
analogous
to
that
of
the
king
of
france
the
president
labors
under
several
causes
of
inferiority
the
authority
of
the
king
in
france
has
in
the
first
place
the
advantage
of
duration
over
that
of
the
president
and
durability
is
one
of
the
chief
elements
of
strength
nothing
is
either
loved
or
feared
but
what
is
likely
to
endure
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
a
magistrate
elected
for
four
years
the
king
in
france
is
an
hereditary
sovereign
in
the
exercise
of
the
executive
power
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
constantly
subject
to
jealous
scrutiny
he
may
make
but
he
can
not
conclude
a
treaty
he
may
designate
but
he
can
not
appoint
a
public
officer
the
king
of
france
is
absolute
in
the
sphere
of
the
executive
power
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
responsible
for
his
actions
but
the
person
of
the
king
is
declared
inviolable
by
the
french
charter
nevertheless
the
supremacy
of
public
opinion
is
no
less
above
the
head
of
one
than
of
the
other
this
power
is
less
definite
less
evident
and
less
sanctioned
by
the
laws
in
france
than
in
america
but
in
fact
exists
in
america
it
acts
by
elections
and
decrees
in
france
it
proceeds
by
revolutions
but
notwithstanding
the
different
constitutions
of
these
two
countries
public
opinion
is
the
predominant
authority
in
both
of
them
the
fundamental
principle
of
legislation
a
principle
essentially
republican
is
the
same
in
both
countries
although
its
consequences
may
be
different
and
its
results
more
or
less
extensive
whence
i
am
led
to
conclude
that
france
with
its
king
is
nearer
akin
to
a
republic
than
the
union
with
its
president
is
to
a
monarchy
in
what
i
have
been
saying
i
have
only
touched
upon
the
main
points
of
distinction
and
if
i
could
have
entered
into
details
the
contrast
would
have
been
rendered
still
more
striking
i
have
remarked
that
the
authority
of
the
president
in
the
united
states
is
only
exercised
within
the
limits
of
a
partial
sovereignty
while
that
of
the
king
in
france
is
undivided
i
might
have
gone
on
to
show
that
the
power
of
the
king
government
in
france
exceeds
its
natural
limits
however
extensive
they
may
be
and
penetrates
in
a
thousand
different
ways
into
the
administration
of
private
interests
among
the
examples
of
this
influence
may
be
quoted
that
which
results
from
the
great
number
of
public
functionaries
who
all
derive
their
appointments
from
the
government
this
number
now
exceeds
all
previous
limits
it
amounts
to
nominations
each
of
which
may
be
considered
as
an
element
of
power
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
not
the
exclusive
right
of
making
any
public
appointments
and
their
whole
number
scarcely
exceeds
those
who
are
desirous
of
tracing
the
question
respecting
the
power
of
the
president
to
remove
every
executive
officer
of
the
government
without
the
sanction
of
the
senate
will
find
some
light
upon
it
by
referring
to
marshall
life
of
washington
sergeant
and
rawle
reports
pennsylvania

debates
on
the
federal
constitution

contains
the
debate

the
question
was

mooted
report
of
a
committee
of
the
senate
in
in
niles
register
of
august
in
that
year
it
is
certainly
very
extraordinary
that
such
a
vast
power
and
one
so
extensively
affecting
the
whole
administration
of
the
government
should
rest
on
such
slight
foundations
as
an
from
an
act
of
congress
providing
that
when
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
should
be
removed
by
the
president
his
assistant
should
discharge
the
duties
of
the
office
how
congress
could
confer
the
power
even
by
a
direct
act
is
not
perceived
it
must
be
a
necessary
implication
from
the
words
of
the
constitution
or
it
does
not
exist
it
has
been
repeatedly
denied
in
and
out
of
congress
and
must
be
considered
as
yet
an
unsettled
accidental
causes
which
may
increase
the
influence
of
the
executive
external
security
of
the
army
of
six
thousand
few
the
president
has
no
opportunity
of
exercising
his
great
in
the
prerogatives
he
exercises
he
is
weak
if
the
executive
power
is
feebler
in
america
than
in
france
the
cause
is
more
attributable
to
the
circumstances
than
to
the
laws
of
the
country
it
is
chiefly
in
its
foreign
relations
that
the
executive
power
of
a
nation
is
called
upon
to
exert
its
skill
and
vigor
if
the
existence
of
the
union
were
perpetually
threatened
and
its
chief
interest
were
in
daily
connexion
with
those
of
other
powerful
nations
the
executive
government
would
assume
an
increased
importance
in
proportion
to
the
measures
expected
of
it
and
those
which
it
would
carry
into
effect
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
the
of
the
army
but
of
an
army
composed
of
only
six
thousand
men
he
commands
the
fleet
but
the
fleet
reckons
but
few
sail
he
conducts
the
foreign
relations
of
the
union
but
the
united
states
are
a
nation
without
neighbors
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
by
the
ocean
and
too
weak
as
yet
to
aim
at
the
dominion
of
the
seas
they
have
no
enemies
and
their
interests
rarely
come
into
contact
with
those
of
any
other
nation
of
the
globe
the
practical
part
of
a
government
must
not
be
judged
by
the
theory
of
its
constitution
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
in
the
possession
of
almost
royal
prerogatives
which
he
has
no
opportunity
of
exercising
and
those
privileges
which
he
can
at
present
use
are
very
circumscribed
the
laws
allow
him
to
possess
a
degree
of
influence
which
circumstances
do
not
permit
him
to
employ
on
the
other
hand
the
great
strength
of
the
royal
prerogative
in
france
arises
from
circumstances
far
more
than
from
the
laws
there
the
executive
government
is
constantly
struggling
against
prodigious
obstacles
and
exerting
all
its
energies
to
repress
them
so
that
it
increases
by
the
extent
of
its
achievements
and
by
the
importance
of
the
events
it
controls
without
for
that
reason
modifying
its
constitution
if
the
laws
had
made
it
as
feeble
and
as
circumscribed
as
it
is
in
the
union
its
influence
would
very
soon
become
much
greater
why
the
president
of
the
united
states
does
not
require
the
majority
of
the
two
houses
in
order
to
carry
on
the
government
it
is
an
established
axiom
in
europe
that
a
constitutional
king
can
not
persevere
in
a
system
of
government
which
is
opposed
by
the
two
other
branches
of
the
legislature
but
several
presidents
of
the
united
states
have
been
known
to
lose
the
majority
in
the
legislative
body
without
being
obliged
to
abandon
the
supreme
power
and
without
inflicting
a
serious
evil
upon
society
i
have
heard
this
fact
quoted
as
an
instance
of
the
independence
and
power
of
executive
government
in
america
a
moment
reflection
will
convince
us
on
the
contrary
that
it
is
a
proof
of
its
extreme
weakness
a
king
in
europe
requires
the
support
of
the
legislature
to
enable
him
to
perform
the
duties
imposed
upon
him
by
the
constitution
because
those
duties
are
enormous
a
constitutional
king
in
europe
is
not
merely
the
executor
of
the
law
but
the
execution
of
its
provisions
devolves
so
completely
upon
him
that
he
has
the
power
of
paralyzing
its
influence
if
it
opposes
his
designs
he
requires
the
assistance
of
the
legislative
assemblies
to
make
the
law
but
those
assemblies
stand
in
need
of
his
aid
to
execute
it
these
two
authorities
can
not
subsist
without
each
other
and
the
mechanism
of
government
is
stopped
as
soon
as
they
are
at
variance
in
america
the
president
can
not
prevent
any
law
from
being
passed
nor
can
he
evade
the
obligation
of
enforcing
it
his
sincere
and
zealous
is
no
doubt
useful
but
it
is
not
indispensable
in
the
carrying
on
of
public
affairs
all
his
important
acts
are
directly
or
indirectly
submitted
to
the
legislature
and
where
he
is
independent
of
it
he
can
do
but
little
it
is
therefore
his
weakness
and
not
his
power
which
enables
him
to
remain
in
opposition
to
congress
in
europe
harmony
must
reign
between
the
crown
and
the
other
branches
of
the
legislature
because
a
collision
between
them
may
prove
serious
in
america
this
harmony
is
not
indispensable
because
such
a
collision
is
impossible
election
of
the
president
dangers
of
the
elective
system
increase
in
proportion
to
the
extent
of
the
this
system
possible
in
america
because
no
powerful
executive
authority
is
what
circumstances
are
favorable
to
the
elective
why
the
election
of
the
president
does
not
cause
a
deviation
from
the
principles
of
the
influence
of
the
election
of
the
president
on
secondary
functionaries
the
dangers
of
the
system
of
election
applied
to
the
head
of
the
executive
government
of
a
great
people
have
been
sufficiently
exemplified
by
experience
and
by
history
and
the
remarks
i
am
about
to
make
refer
to
america
alone
these
dangers
may
be
more
or
less
formidable
in
proportion
to
the
place
which
the
executive
power
occupies
and
to
the
importance
it
possesses
in
the
state
and
they
may
vary
according
to
the
mode
of
election
and
the
circumstances
in
which
the
electors
are
placed
the
most
weighty
argument
against
the
election
of
a
is
that
it
offers
so
splendid
a
lure
to
private
ambition
and
is
so
apt
to
inflame
men
in
the
pursuit
of
power
that
when
legitimate
means
are
wanting
force
may
not
unfrequently
seize
what
right
denies
it
is
clear
that
the
greater
the
privileges
of
the
executive
authority
are
the
greater
is
the
temptation
the
more
the
ambition
of
the
candidates
is
excited
the
more
warmly
are
their
interests
espoused
by
a
throng
of
partisans
who
hope
to
share
the
power
when
their
patron
has
won
the
prize
the
dangers
of
the
elective
system
increase
therefore
in
the
exact
ratio
of
the
influence
exercised
by
the
executive
power
in
the
affairs
of
state
the
revolutions
of
poland
are
not
solely
attributable
to
the
elective
system
in
general
but
to
the
fact
that
the
elected
magistrate
was
the
head
of
a
powerful
monarchy
before
we
can
discuss
the
absolute
advantages
of
the
elective
system
we
must
make
preliminary
inquiries
as
to
whether
the
geographical
position
the
laws
the
habits
the
manners
and
the
opinions
of
the
people
among
whom
it
is
to
be
introduced
will
admit
of
the
establishment
of
a
weak
and
dependent
executive
government
for
to
attempt
to
render
the
representative
of
the
state
a
powerful
sovereign
and
at
the
same
time
elective
is
in
my
opinion
to
entertain
two
incompatible
designs
to
reduce
hereditary
royalty
to
the
condition
of
an
elective
authority
the
only
means
that
i
am
acquainted
with
are
to
circumscribe
its
sphere
of
action
beforehand
gradually
to
diminish
its
prerogatives
and
to
accustom
the
people
to
live
without
its
protection
nothing
however
is
farther
from
the
designs
of
the
republicans
of
europe
than
this
course
as
many
of
them
only
owe
their
hatred
of
tyranny
to
the
sufferings
which
they
have
personally
undergone
the
extent
of
the
executive
power
does
not
excite
their
hostility
and
they
only
attack
its
origin
without
perceiving
how
nearly
the
two
things
are
connected
hitherto
no
citizen
has
shown
any
disposition
to
expose
his
honor
and
his
life
in
order
to
become
the
president
of
the
united
states
because
the
power
of
that
office
is
temporary
limited
and
subordinate
the
prize
of
fortune
must
be
great
to
encourage
adventurers
in
so
desperate
a
game
no
candidate
has
as
yet
been
able
to
arouse
the
dangerous
enthusiasm
or
the
passionate
sympathies
of
the
people
in
his
favor
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
when
he
is
at
the
head
of
the
government
he
has
but
little
power
but
little
wealth
and
but
little
glory
to
share
among
his
friends
and
his
influence
in
the
state
is
too
small
for
the
success
or
the
ruin
of
a
faction
to
depend
upon
the
elevation
of
an
individual
to
power
the
great
advantage
of
hereditary
monarchies
is
that
as
the
private
interest
of
a
family
is
always
intimately
connected
with
the
interests
of
the
state
the
executive
government
is
never
suspended
for
a
single
instant
and
if
the
affairs
of
a
monarchy
are
not
better
conducted
than
those
of
a
republic
at
least
there
is
always
some
one
to
conduct
them
well
or
ill
according
to
his
capacity
in
elective
states
on
the
contrary
the
wheels
of
government
cease
to
act
as
it
were
of
their
own
accord
at
the
approach
of
an
election
and
even
for
some
time
previous
to
that
event
the
laws
may
indeed
accelerate
the
operation
of
the
election
which
may
be
conducted
with
such
simplicity
and
rapidity
that
the
seat
of
power
will
never
be
left
vacant
but
notwithstanding
these
precautions
a
break
necessarily
occurs
in
the
minds
of
the
people
at
the
approach
of
an
election
the
head
of
the
executive
government
is
wholly
occupied
by
the
coming
struggle
his
future
plans
are
doubtful
he
can
undertake
nothing
new
and
he
will
only
prosecute
with
indifference
those
designs
which
another
will
perhaps
terminate
i
am
so
near
the
time
of
my
retirement
from
office
said
president
jefferson
on
the
of
january
six
weeks
before
the
election
that
i
feel
no
passion
i
take
no
part
i
express
no
sentiment
it
appears
to
me
just
to
leave
to
my
successor
the
commencement
of
those
measures
which
he
will
have
to
prosecute
and
for
which
he
will
be
responsible
on
the
other
hand
the
eyes
of
the
nation
are
centred
on
a
single
point
all
are
watching
the
gradual
birth
of
so
important
an
event
the
wider
the
influence
of
the
executive
power
extends
the
greater
and
the
more
necessary
is
its
constant
action
the
more
fatal
is
the
term
of
suspense
and
a
nation
which
is
accustomed
to
the
government
or
still
more
one
used
to
the
administrative
protection
of
a
powerful
executive
authority
would
be
infallibly
convulsed
by
an
election
of
this
kind
in
the
united
states
the
action
of
the
government
may
be
slackened
with
impunity
because
it
is
always
weak
and
circumscribed
one
of
the
principal
vices
of
the
elective
system
is
that
it
always
introduces
a
certain
degree
of
instability
into
the
internal
and
external
policy
of
the
state
but
this
disadvantage
is
less
sensibly
felt
if
the
share
of
power
vested
in
the
elected
magistrate
is
small
in
rome
the
principles
of
the
government
underwent
no
variation
although
the
consuls
were
changed
every
year
because
the
senate
which
was
an
hereditary
assembly
possessed
the
directing
authority
if
the
elective
system
were
adopted
in
europe
the
condition
of
most
of
the
monarchical
states
would
be
changed
at
every
new
election
in
america
the
president
exercises
a
certain
influence
on
state
affairs
but
he
does
not
conduct
them
the
preponderating
power
is
vested
in
the
representatives
of
the
whole
nation
the
political
maxims
of
the
country
depend
therefore
on
the
mass
of
the
people
not
on
the
president
alone
and
consequently
in
america
the
elective
system
has
no
very
prejudicial
influence
on
the
fixed
principles
of
the
government
but
the
want
of
fixed
principles
is
an
evil
so
inherent
in
the
elective
system
that
it
is
still
extremely
perceptible
in
the
narrow
sphere
to
which
the
authority
of
the
president
extends
the
americans
have
admitted
that
the
head
of
the
executive
power
who
has
to
bear
the
whole
responsibility
of
the
duties
he
is
called
upon
to
fulfil
ought
to
be
empowered
to
choose
his
own
agents
and
to
remove
them
at
pleasure
the
legislative
bodies
watch
the
conduct
of
the
president
more
than
they
direct
it
the
consequence
of
this
arrangement
is
that
at
every
new
election
the
fate
of
all
the
federal
public
officers
is
in
suspense
quincy
adams
on
his
entry
into
office
discharged
the
majority
of
the
individuals
who
had
been
appointed
by
his
predecessor
and
i
am
not
aware
that
general
jackson
allowed
a
single
removeable
functionary
employed
in
the
federal
service
to
retain
his
place
beyond
the
first
year
which
succeeded
his
election
it
is
sometimes
made
a
subject
of
complaint
that
in
the
constitutional
monarchies
of
europe
the
fate
of
the
humbler
servants
of
an
administration
depends
upon
that
of
the
ministers
but
in
elective
governments
this
evil
is
far
greater
in
a
constitutional
monarchy
successive
ministers
are
rapidly
formed
but
as
the
principal
representative
of
the
executive
power
does
not
change
the
spirit
of
innovation
is
kept
within
bounds
the
changes
which
take
place
are
in
the
details
rather
than
in
the
principles
of
the
administrative
system
but
to
substitute
one
system
for
another
as
is
done
in
america
every
four
years
by
law
is
to
cause
a
sort
of
revolution
as
to
the
misfortunes
which
may
fall
upon
individuals
in
consequence
of
this
state
of
things
it
must
be
allowed
that
the
uncertain
situation
of
the
public
officers
is
less
fraught
with
evil
consequences
in
america
than
elsewhere
it
is
so
easy
to
acquire
an
independent
position
in
the
united
states
that
the
public
officer
who
loses
his
place
may
be
deprived
of
the
comforts
of
life
but
not
of
the
means
of
subsistence
i
remarked
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
that
the
dangers
of
the
elective
system
applied
to
the
head
of
the
state
are
augmented
or
decreased
by
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
people
which
adopts
it
however
the
functions
of
the
executive
power
may
be
restricted
it
must
always
exercise
a
great
influence
upon
the
foreign
policy
of
the
country
for
a
negotiation
can
not
be
opened
or
successfully
carried
on
otherwise
than
by
a
single
agent
the
more
precarious
and
the
more
perilous
the
position
of
a
people
becomes
the
more
absolute
is
the
want
of
a
fixed
and
consistent
external
policy
and
the
more
dangerous
does
the
elective
system
of
the
chief
magistrate
become
the
policy
of
the
americans
in
relation
to
the
whole
world
is
exceedingly
simple
and
it
may
almost
be
said
that
no
country
stands
in
need
of
them
nor
do
they
require
the
of
any
other
people
their
independence
is
never
threatened
in
their
present
condition
therefore
the
functions
of
the
executive
power
are
no
less
limited
by
circumstances
than
by
the
laws
and
the
president
may
frequently
change
his
line
of
policy
without
involving
the
state
in
difficulty
or
destruction
whatever
the
prerogatives
of
the
executive
power
may
be
the
period
which
immediately
precedes
an
election
and
the
moment
of
its
duration
must
always
be
considered
as
a
national
crisis
which
is
perilous
in
proportion
to
the
internal
embarrassments
and
the
external
dangers
of
the
country
few
of
the
nations
of
europe
could
escape
the
calamities
of
anarchy
or
of
conquest
every
time
they
might
have
to
elect
a
new
sovereign
in
america
society
is
so
constituted
that
it
can
stand
without
assistance
upon
its
own
basis
nothing
is
to
be
feared
from
the
pressure
of
external
dangers
and
the
election
of
the
president
is
a
cause
of
agitation
but
not
of
ruin
mode
of
election
skill
of
the
american
legislators
shown
in
the
mode
of
election
adopted
by
creation
of
a
special
electoral
separate
votes
of
these
case
in
which
the
house
of
representatives
is
called
upon
to
choose
the
results
of
the
twelve
elections
which
have
taken
place
since
the
constitution
has
been
established
beside
the
dangers
which
are
inherent
in
the
system
many
other
difficulties
may
arise
from
the
mode
of
election
which
may
be
obviated
by
the
precaution
of
the
legislator
when
a
people
met
in
arms
on
some
public
spot
to
choose
its
head
it
was
exposed
to
all
the
chances
of
civil
war
resulting
from
so
martial
a
mode
of
proceeding
beside
the
dangers
of
the
elective
system
in
itself
the
polish
laws
which
subjected
the
election
of
the
sovereign
to
the
veto
of
a
single
individual
suggested
the
murder
of
that
individual
or
prepared
the
way
to
anarchy
in
the
examination
of
the
institutions
and
the
political
as
well
as
the
social
condition
of
the
united
states
we
are
struck
by
the
admirable
harmony
of
the
gifts
of
fortune
and
the
efforts
of
man
that
nation
possessed
two
of
the
main
causes
of
internal
peace
it
was
a
new
country
but
it
was
inhabited
by
a
people
grown
old
in
the
exercise
of
freedom
america
had
no
hostile
neighbors
to
dread
and
the
american
legislators
profiting
by
these
favorable
circumstances
created
a
weak
and
subordinate
executive
power
which
could
without
danger
be
made
elective
it
then
only
remained
for
them
to
choose
the
least
dangerous
of
the
various
modes
of
election
and
the
rules
which
they
laid
down
upon
this
point
admirably
complete
the
securities
which
the
physical
and
political
constitution
of
the
country
already
afforded
their
object
was
to
find
the
mode
of
election
which
would
best
express
the
choice
of
the
people
with
the
least
possible
excitement
and
suspense
it
was
admitted
in
the
first
place
that
the
majority
should
be
decisive
but
the
difficulty
was
to
obtain
this
majority
without
an
interval
of
delay
which
it
was
most
important
to
avoid
it
rarely
happens
that
an
individual
can
at
once
collect
the
majority
of
the
suffrages
of
a
great
people
and
this
difficulty
is
enhanced
in
a
republic
of
confederate
states
where
local
influences
are
apt
to
preponderate
the
means
by
which
it
was
proposed
to
obviate
this
second
obstacle
was
to
delegate
the
electoral
powers
of
the
nation
to
a
body
of
representatives
the
mode
of
election
rendered
a
majority
more
probable
for
the
fewer
the
electors
are
the
greater
is
the
chance
of
their
coming
to
a
final
decision
it
also
offered
an
additional
probability
of
a
judicious
choice
it
then
remained
to
be
decided
whether
this
right
of
election
was
to
be
intrusted
to
the
legislative
body
the
habitual
representative
assembly
of
the
nation
or
whether
an
electoral
assembly
should
be
formed
for
the
express
purpose
of
proceeding
to
the
nomination
of
a
president
the
americans
chose
the
latter
alternative
from
a
belief
that
the
individuals
who
were
returned
to
make
the
laws
were
incompetent
to
represent
the
wishes
of
the
nation
in
the
election
of
its
chief
magistrate
and
that
as
they
are
chosen
for
more
than
a
year
the
constituency
they
represented
might
have
changed
its
opinion
in
that
time
it
was
thought
that
if
the
legislature
was
empowered
to
elect
the
head
of
the
executive
power
its
members
would
for
some
time
before
the
election
be
exposed
to
the
manoeuvres
of
corruption
and
the
tricks
of
intrigue
whereas
the
special
electors
would
like
a
jury
remain
mixed
up
with
the
crowd
till
the
day
of
action
when
they
would
appear
for
the
sole
purpose
of
giving
their
votes
it
was
therefore
established
that
every
state
should
name
a
certain
number
of
electors
who
in
their
turn
should
elect
the
president
and
as
it
had
been
observed
that
the
assemblies
to
which
the
choice
of
a
chief
magistrate
had
been
intrusted
in
elective
countries
inevitably
became
the
centres
of
passion
and
of
cabal
that
they
sometimes
usurped
an
authority
which
did
not
belong
to
them
and
that
their
proceedings
or
the
uncertainty
which
resulted
from
them
were
sometimes
prolonged
so
much
as
to
endanger
the
welfare
of
the
state
it
was
determined
that
the
electors
should
all
vote
upon
the
same
day
without
being
convoked
to
the
same
place
this
double
election
rendered
a
majority
probable
though
not
certain
for
it
was
possible
that
as
many
differences
might
exist
between
the
electors
as
between
their
constituents
in
this
case
it
was
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
one
of
three
measures
either
to
appoint
new
electors
or
to
consult
a
second
time
those
already
appointed
or
to
defer
the
election
to
another
authority
the
first
two
of
these
alternatives
independently
of
the
uncertainty
of
their
results
were
likely
to
delay
the
final
decision
and
to
perpetuate
an
agitation
which
must
always
be
accompanied
with
danger
the
third
expedient
was
therefore
adopted
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
votes
should
be
transmitted
sealed
to
the
president
of
the
senate
and
that
they
should
be
opened
and
counted
in
the
presence
of
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
if
none
of
the
candidates
has
a
majority
the
house
of
representatives
then
proceeds
immediately
to
elect
the
president
but
with
the
condition
that
it
must
fix
upon
one
of
the
three
candidates
who
have
the
highest
numbers
thus
it
is
only
in
case
of
an
event
which
can
not
often
happen
and
which
can
never
be
foreseen
that
the
election
is
intrusted
to
the
ordinary
representatives
of
the
nation
and
even
then
they
are
obliged
to
choose
a
citizen
who
has
already
been
designated
by
a
powerful
minority
of
the
special
electors
it
is
by
this
happy
expedient
that
the
respect
due
to
the
popular
voice
is
combined
with
the
utmost
celerity
of
execution
and
those
precautions
which
the
peace
of
the
country
demands
but
the
decision
of
the
question
by
the
house
of
representatives
does
not
necessarily
offer
an
immediate
solution
of
the
difficulty
for
the
majority
of
that
assembly
may
still
be
doubtful
and
in
this
case
the
constitution
prescribes
no
remedy
nevertheless
by
restricting
the
number
of
candidates
to
three
and
by
referring
the
matter
to
the
judgment
of
an
enlightened
public
body
it
has
smoothed
all
the
obstacles
which
are
not
inherent
in
the
elective
system
in
the
forty
years
which
have
elapsed
since
the
promulgation
of
the
federal
constitution
the
united
states
have
twelve
times
chosen
a
president
ten
of
these
elections
took
place
simultaneously
by
the
votes
of
the
special
electors
in
the
different
states
the
house
of
representatives
has
only
twice
exercised
its
conditional
privilege
of
deciding
in
cases
of
uncertainty
the
first
time
was
at
the
election
of
jefferson
in
the
second
was
in
when
john
quincy
adams
was
chosen
crisis
of
the
election
the
election
may
be
considered
as
a
national
why
passions
of
the
anxiety
of
the
calm
which
succeeds
the
agitation
of
the
election
i
have
shown
what
the
circumstances
are
which
favored
the
adoption
of
the
elective
system
in
the
united
states
and
what
precautions
were
taken
by
the
legislators
to
obviate
its
dangers
the
americans
are
accustomed
to
all
kinds
of
elections
and
they
know
by
experience
the
utmost
degree
of
excitement
which
is
compatible
with
security
the
vast
extent
of
the
country
and
the
dissemination
of
the
inhabitants
render
a
collision
between
parties
less
probable
and
less
dangerous
there
than
elsewhere
the
political
circumstances
under
which
the
elections
have
hitherto
been
carried
on
have
presented
no
real
embarrassments
to
the
nation
nevertheless
the
epoch
of
the
election
of
a
president
of
the
united
states
may
be
considered
as
a
crisis
in
the
affairs
of
the
nation
the
influence
which
he
exercises
on
public
business
is
no
doubt
feeble
and
indirect
but
the
choice
of
the
president
which
is
of
small
importance
to
each
individual
citizen
concerns
the
citizens
collectively
and
however
trifling
an
interest
may
be
it
assumes
a
great
degree
of
importance
as
soon
as
it
becomes
general
the
president
possesses
but
few
means
of
rewarding
his
supporters
in
comparison
to
the
kings
of
europe
but
the
places
which
are
at
his
disposal
are
sufficiently
numerous
to
interest
directly
or
indirectly
several
thousand
electors
in
his
success
moreover
political
parties
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
elsewhere
are
led
to
rally
around
an
individual
in
order
to
acquire
a
more
tangible
shape
in
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
and
the
name
of
the
candidate
for
the
presidency
is
put
forth
as
the
symbol
and
personification
of
their
theories
for
these
reasons
parties
are
strongly
interested
in
gaining
the
election
not
so
much
with
a
view
to
the
triumph
of
their
principles
under
the
auspices
of
the
president
elected
as
to
show
by
the
majority
which
returned
him
the
strength
of
the
supporters
of
those
principles
for
a
long
while
before
the
appointed
time
is
at
hand
the
election
becomes
the
most
important
and
the
topic
of
discussion
the
ardor
of
faction
is
redoubled
and
all
the
artificial
passions
which
the
imagination
can
create
in
the
bosom
of
a
happy
and
peaceful
land
are
agitated
and
brought
to
light
the
president
on
the
other
hand
is
absorbed
by
the
cares
of
he
no
longer
governs
for
the
interest
of
the
state
but
for
that
of
his
he
does
homage
to
the
majority
and
instead
of
checking
its
passions
as
his
duty
commands
him
to
do
he
frequently
courts
its
worst
caprices
as
the
election
draws
near
the
activity
of
intrigue
and
the
agitation
of
the
populace
increase
the
citizens
are
divided
into
several
camps
each
of
which
assumes
the
name
of
its
favorite
candidate
the
whole
nation
glows
with
feverish
excitement
the
election
is
the
daily
theme
of
the
public
papers
the
subject
of
private
conversation
the
end
of
every
thought
and
every
action
the
sole
interest
of
the
present
as
soon
as
the
choice
is
determined
this
ardor
is
dispelled
and
as
a
calmer
season
returns
the
current
of
the
state
which
has
nearly
broken
its
banks
sinks
to
its
usual
level
but
who
can
refrain
from
astonishment
at
the
causes
of
the
storm
of
the
president
when
the
head
of
the
executive
power
is
it
is
the
state
which
is
the
source
of
intrigue
and
the
desire
of
being
the
chief
aim
of
a
president
of
the
united
disadvantage
of
the
system
peculiar
to
the
natural
evil
of
democracy
is
that
it
subordinates
all
authority
to
the
slightest
desires
of
the
the
of
the
president
encourages
this
evil
it
may
be
asked
whether
the
legislators
of
the
united
states
did
right
or
wrong
in
allowing
the
of
the
president
it
seems
at
first
sight
contrary
to
all
reason
to
prevent
the
head
of
the
executive
power
from
being
elected
a
second
time
the
influence
which
the
talents
and
the
character
of
a
single
individual
may
exercise
upon
the
fate
of
a
whole
people
especially
in
critical
circumstances
or
arduous
times
is
well
known
a
law
preventing
the
of
the
chief
magistrate
would
deprive
the
citizens
of
the
surest
pledge
of
the
prosperity
and
the
security
of
the
commonwealth
and
by
a
singular
inconsistency
a
man
would
be
excluded
from
the
government
at
the
very
time
when
he
had
shown
his
ability
in
conducting
its
affairs
but
if
these
arguments
are
strong
perhaps
still
more
powerful
reasons
may
be
advanced
against
them
intrigue
and
corruption
are
the
natural
defects
of
elective
government
but
when
the
head
of
the
state
can
be
these
evils
rise
to
a
great
height
and
compromise
the
very
existence
of
the
country
when
a
simple
candidate
seeks
to
rise
by
intrigue
his
manoeuvres
must
necessarily
be
limited
to
a
narrow
sphere
but
when
the
chief
magistrate
enters
the
lists
he
borrows
the
strength
of
the
government
for
his
own
purposes
in
the
former
case
the
feeble
resources
of
an
individual
are
in
action
in
the
latter
the
state
itself
with
all
its
immense
influence
is
busied
in
the
work
of
corruption
and
cabal
the
private
citizen
who
employs
the
most
immoral
practices
to
acquire
power
can
only
act
in
a
manner
indirectly
prejudicial
to
the
public
prosperity
but
if
the
representative
of
the
executive
descends
into
the
lists
the
cares
of
government
dwindle
into
importance
and
the
success
of
his
election
is
his
first
concern
all
laws
and
negotiations
are
then
to
him
nothing
more
than
electioneering
schemes
places
become
the
reward
of
services
rendered
not
to
the
nation
but
to
its
chief
and
the
influence
of
the
government
if
not
injurious
to
the
country
is
at
least
no
longer
beneficial
to
the
community
for
which
it
was
created
it
is
impossible
to
consider
the
ordinary
course
of
affairs
in
the
united
states
without
perceiving
that
the
desire
of
being
is
the
chief
aim
of
the
president
that
his
whole
administration
and
even
his
most
indifferent
measures
tend
to
this
object
and
that
as
the
crisis
approaches
his
personal
interest
takes
the
place
of
his
interest
in
the
public
good
the
principle
of
renders
the
corrupt
influence
of
elective
governments
still
more
extensive
and
pernicious
it
tends
to
degrade
the
political
morality
of
the
people
and
to
substitute
adroitness
for
patriotism
in
america
it
exercises
a
still
more
fatal
influence
on
the
sources
of
national
existence
every
government
seems
to
be
afflicted
by
some
evil
inherent
in
its
nature
and
the
genius
of
the
legislator
is
shown
in
eluding
its
attacks
a
state
may
survive
the
influence
of
a
host
of
bad
laws
and
the
mischief
they
cause
is
frequently
exaggerated
but
a
law
which
encourages
the
growth
of
the
canker
within
must
prove
fatal
in
the
end
although
its
bad
consequences
may
not
be
immediately
perceived
the
principle
of
destruction
in
absolute
monarchies
lies
in
the
excessive
and
unreasonable
extension
of
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
and
a
measure
tending
to
remove
the
constitutional
provisions
which
counterbalance
this
influence
would
be
radically
bad
even
if
its
consequences
should
long
appear
to
be
imperceptible
by
a
parity
of
reasoning
in
countries
governed
by
a
democracy
where
the
people
is
perpetually
drawing
all
authority
to
itself
the
laws
which
increase
or
accelerate
its
action
are
the
direct
assailants
of
the
very
principle
of
the
government
the
greatest
proof
of
the
ability
of
the
american
legislators
is
that
they
clearly
discerned
this
truth
and
that
they
had
the
courage
to
act
up
to
it
they
conceived
that
a
certain
authority
above
the
body
of
the
people
was
necessary
which
should
enjoy
a
degree
of
independence
without
however
being
entirely
beyond
the
popular
control
an
authority
which
would
be
forced
to
comply
with
the
determinations
of
the
majority
but
which
would
be
able
to
resist
its
caprices
and
to
refuse
its
most
dangerous
demands
to
this
end
they
centred
the
whole
executive
power
of
the
nation
in
a
single
arm
they
granted
extensive
prerogatives
to
the
president
and
they
armed
him
with
the
veto
to
resist
the
encroachments
of
the
legislature
but
by
introducing
the
principle
of
they
partly
destroyed
their
work
and
they
rendered
the
president
but
little
inclined
to
exert
the
great
power
they
had
invested
in
his
hands
if
ineligible
a
second
time
the
president
would
be
far
from
independent
of
the
people
for
his
responsibility
would
not
be
lessened
but
the
favor
of
the
people
would
not
be
so
necessary
to
him
as
to
induce
him
to
court
it
by
humoring
its
desires
if
and
this
is
more
especially
true
at
the
present
day
when
political
morality
is
relaxed
and
when
great
men
are
rare
the
president
of
the
united
states
becomes
an
easy
tool
in
the
hands
of
the
majority
he
adopts
its
likings
and
its
animosities
he
hastens
to
anticipate
its
wishes
he
forestalls
its
complaints
he
yields
to
its
idlest
cravings
and
instead
of
guiding
it
as
the
legislature
intended
that
he
should
do
he
is
ever
ready
to
follow
its
bidding
thus
in
order
not
to
deprive
the
state
of
the
talents
of
an
individual
those
talents
have
been
rendered
almost
useless
and
to
reserve
an
expedient
for
extraordinary
perils
the
country
has
been
exposed
to
daily
dangers
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
leaving
the
president
is
one
of
that
class
which
probably
must
for
ever
remain
undecided
the
author
himself
at
page
gives
a
strong
reason
for
so
that
the
chance
of
a
prolonged
administration
may
inspire
him
with
hopeful
undertakings
for
the
public
good
and
with
the
means
of
carrying
them
into
execution
considerations
of
great
weight
there
is
an
important
fact
bearing
upon
this
question
which
should
be
stated
in
connexion
with
it
president
washington
established
the
practice
of
declining
a
third
election
and
every
one
of
his
successors
either
from
a
sense
of
its
propriety
or
from
apprehensions
of
the
force
of
public
opinion
has
followed
the
example
so
that
it
has
become
as
much
a
part
of
the
constitution
that
no
citizen
can
be
a
third
time
elected
president
as
if
it
were
expressed
in
that
instrument
in
words
this
may
perhaps
be
considered
a
fair
adjustment
of
objections
on
either
side
those
against
a
continued
and
perpetual
are
certainly
met
while
the
arguments
in
favor
of
an
opportunity
to
prolong
an
administration
under
circumstances
that
may
justify
it
are
allowed
their
due
weight
one
effect
of
this
practical
interpolation
of
the
constitution
unquestionably
is
to
increase
the
chances
of
a
being
once
as
men
will
be
more
disposed
to
acquiesce
in
a
measure
that
thus
practically
excludes
the
individual
from
ever
again
entering
the
field
of
federal
courts
political
importance
of
the
judiciary
in
the
united
difficulty
of
treating
this
utility
of
judicial
power
in
confederations
what
tribunals
could
be
introduced
into
the
necessity
of
establishing
federal
courts
of
organization
of
the
national
the
supreme
in
what
it
differs
from
all
known
tribunals
i
have
inquired
into
the
legislative
and
executive
power
of
the
union
and
the
judicial
power
now
remains
to
be
examined
but
in
this
place
i
can
not
conceal
my
fears
from
the
reader
judicial
institutions
exercise
a
great
influence
on
the
condition
of
the
and
they
occupy
a
prominent
place
among
what
are
properly
called
political
institutions
in
this
respect
they
are
peculiarly
deserving
of
our
attention
but
i
am
at
a
loss
to
explain
the
political
action
of
the
american
tribunals
without
entering
into
some
technical
details
on
their
constitution
and
their
forms
of
proceeding
and
i
know
not
how
to
descend
to
these
minutiae
without
wearying
the
curiosity
of
the
reader
by
the
natural
aridity
of
the
subject
or
without
risking
to
fall
into
obscurity
through
a
desire
to
be
succinct
i
can
scarcely
hope
to
escape
these
various
evils
for
if
i
appear
too
prolix
to
a
man
of
the
world
a
lawyer
may
on
the
other
hand
complain
of
my
brevity
but
these
are
the
natural
disadvantages
of
my
subject
and
more
especially
of
the
point
which
i
am
about
to
discuss
the
great
difficulty
was
not
to
devise
the
constitution
of
the
federal
government
but
to
find
out
a
method
of
enforcing
its
laws
governments
have
in
general
but
two
means
of
overcoming
the
opposition
of
the
people
they
govern
the
physical
force
which
is
at
their
own
disposal
and
the
moral
force
which
they
derive
from
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
justice
a
government
which
should
have
no
other
means
of
exacting
obedience
than
open
war
must
be
very
near
its
ruin
for
one
of
two
alternatives
would
then
probably
occur
if
its
authority
was
small
and
its
character
temperate
it
would
not
resort
to
violence
till
the
last
extremity
and
it
would
connive
at
a
number
of
partial
acts
of
insubordination
in
which
case
the
state
would
gradually
fall
into
anarchy
if
it
was
enterprising
and
powerful
it
would
perpetually
have
recourse
to
its
physical
strength
and
would
speedily
degenerate
into
a
military
despotism
so
that
its
activity
would
not
be
less
prejudicial
to
the
community
than
its
inaction
the
great
end
of
justice
is
to
substitute
the
notion
of
right
for
that
of
violence
and
to
place
a
legal
barrier
between
the
power
of
the
government
and
the
use
of
physical
force
the
authority
which
is
awarded
to
the
intervention
of
a
court
of
justice
by
the
general
opinion
of
mankind
is
so
surprisingly
great
that
it
clings
to
the
mere
formalities
of
justice
and
gives
a
bodily
influence
to
the
shadow
of
the
law
the
moral
force
which
courts
of
justice
possess
renders
the
introduction
of
physical
force
exceedingly
rare
and
it
is
very
frequently
substituted
for
it
but
if
the
latter
proves
to
be
indispensable
its
power
is
doubled
by
the
association
of
the
idea
of
law
a
federal
government
stands
in
greater
need
of
the
support
of
judicial
institutions
than
any
other
because
it
is
naturally
weak
and
opposed
to
formidable
opposition
if
it
were
always
obliged
to
resort
to
violence
in
the
first
instance
it
could
not
fulfil
its
task
the
union
therefore
required
a
national
judiciary
to
enforce
the
obedience
of
the
citizens
to
the
laws
and
to
repel
the
attacks
which
might
be
directed
against
them
the
question
then
remained
what
tribunals
were
to
exercise
these
privileges
were
they
to
be
intrusted
to
the
courts
of
justice
which
were
already
organized
in
every
state
or
was
it
necessary
to
create
federal
courts
it
may
easily
be
proved
that
the
union
could
not
adapt
the
judicial
power
of
the
state
to
its
wants
the
separation
of
the
judiciary
from
the
administrative
power
of
the
state
no
doubt
affects
the
security
of
every
citizen
and
the
liberty
of
all
but
it
is
no
less
important
to
the
existence
of
the
nation
that
these
several
powers
should
have
the
same
origin
should
follow
the
same
principles
and
act
in
the
same
sphere
in
a
word
that
they
should
be
correlative
and
homogeneous
no
one
i
presume
ever
suggested
the
advantage
of
trying
offences
committed
in
france
by
a
foreign
court
of
justice
in
order
to
ensure
the
impartiality
of
the
judges
the
americans
form
one
people
in
relation
to
their
federal
government
but
in
the
bosom
of
this
people
divers
political
bodies
have
been
allowed
to
subsist
which
are
dependent
on
the
national
government
in
a
few
points
and
independent
in
all
the
rest
which
have
all
a
distinct
origin
maxims
peculiar
to
themselves
and
special
means
of
carrying
on
their
affairs
to
intrust
the
execution
of
the
laws
of
the
union
to
tribunals
instituted
by
these
political
bodies
would
be
to
allow
foreign
judges
to
preside
over
the
nation
nay
more
not
only
is
each
state
foreign
to
the
union
at
large
but
it
is
in
perpetual
opposition
to
the
common
interests
since
whatever
authority
the
union
loses
turns
to
the
advantage
of
the
states
thus
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
union
by
means
of
the
tribunals
of
the
states
would
be
to
allow
not
only
foreign
but
partial
judges
to
preside
over
the
nation
but
the
number
still
more
than
the
mere
character
of
the
tribunals
of
the
states
rendered
them
unfit
for
the
service
of
the
nation
when
the
federal
constitution
was
formed
there
were
already
thirteen
courts
of
justice
in
the
united
states
which
decided
causes
without
appeal
that
number
is
now
increased
to
to
suppose
that
a
state
can
subsist
when
its
fundamental
laws
may
be
subjected
to
different
interpretations
at
the
same
time
is
to
advance
a
proposition
alike
contrary
to
reason
and
to
experience
the
american
legislators
therefore
agreed
to
create
a
federal
judiciary
power
to
apply
the
laws
of
the
union
and
to
determine
certain
questions
affecting
general
interests
which
were
carefully
determined
beforehand
the
entire
judicial
power
of
the
union
was
centred
in
one
tribunal
which
was
denominated
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
but
to
facilitate
the
expedition
of
business
inferior
courts
were
appended
to
it
which
were
empowered
to
decide
causes
of
small
importance
without
appeal
and
with
appeal
causes
of
more
magnitude
the
members
of
the
supreme
court
are
named
neither
by
the
people
nor
the
legislature
but
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
acting
with
the
advice
of
the
senate
in
order
to
render
them
independent
of
the
other
authorities
their
office
was
made
inalienable
and
it
was
determined
that
their
salary
when
once
fixed
should
not
be
altered
by
the
legislature
it
was
easy
to
proclaim
the
principle
of
a
federal
judiciary
but
difficulties
multiplied
when
the
extent
of
its
jurisdiction
was
to
be
determined
means
of
determining
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
difficulty
of
determining
the
jurisdiction
of
separate
courts
of
justice
in
the
courts
of
the
union
obtained
the
right
of
fixing
their
own
in
what
respect
this
rule
attacks
the
portion
of
sovereignty
reserved
to
the
several
the
sovereignty
of
these
states
restricted
by
the
laws
and
the
interpretation
of
the
consequently
the
danger
of
the
several
states
is
more
apparent
than
real
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
recognized
two
distinct
powers
in
presence
of
each
other
represented
in
a
judicial
point
of
view
by
two
distinct
classes
of
courts
of
justice
the
utmost
care
which
could
be
taken
in
defining
their
separate
jurisdictions
would
have
been
insufficient
to
prevent
frequent
collisions
between
those
tribunals
the
question
then
arose
to
whom
the
right
of
deciding
the
competency
of
each
court
was
to
be
referred
in
nations
which
constitute
a
single
body
politic
when
a
question
is
debated
between
two
courts
relating
to
their
mutual
jurisdiction
a
third
tribunal
is
generally
within
reach
to
decide
the
difference
and
this
is
effected
without
difficulty
because
in
these
nations
the
questions
of
judicial
competency
have
no
connexion
with
the
privileges
of
the
national
supremacy
but
it
was
impossible
to
create
an
arbiter
between
a
superior
court
of
the
union
and
the
superior
court
of
a
separate
state
which
would
not
belong
to
one
of
these
two
classes
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
allow
one
of
these
courts
to
judge
its
own
cause
and
to
take
or
to
retain
cognizance
of
the
point
which
was
contested
to
grant
this
privilege
to
the
different
courts
of
the
states
would
have
been
to
destroy
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
after
having
established
it
for
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
would
soon
have
restored
that
portion
of
independence
to
the
states
of
which
the
terms
of
that
act
deprived
them
the
object
of
the
creation
of
a
federal
tribunal
was
to
prevent
the
courts
of
the
states
from
deciding
questions
affecting
the
national
interests
in
their
own
department
and
so
to
form
a
uniform
body
of
jurisprudence
for
the
interpretation
of
the
laws
of
the
union
this
end
would
not
have
been
accomplished
if
the
courts
of
the
several
states
had
been
competent
to
decide
upon
cases
in
their
separate
capacities
from
which
they
were
obliged
to
abstain
as
federal
tribunals
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
was
therefore
invested
with
the
right
of
determining
all
questions
of
jurisdiction
this
was
a
severe
blow
upon
the
independence
of
the
states
which
was
thus
restricted
not
only
by
the
laws
but
by
the
interpretation
of
them
by
one
limit
which
was
known
and
by
another
which
was
dubious
by
a
rule
which
was
certain
and
a
rule
which
was
arbitrary
it
is
true
the
constitution
had
laid
down
the
precise
limits
of
the
federal
supremacy
but
whenever
this
supremacy
is
contested
by
one
of
the
states
a
federal
tribunal
decides
the
question
nevertheless
the
dangers
with
which
the
independence
of
the
states
was
threatened
by
this
mode
of
proceeding
are
less
serious
than
they
appear
to
be
we
shall
see
hereafter
that
in
america
the
real
strength
of
the
country
is
vested
in
the
provincial
far
more
than
in
the
federal
government
the
federal
judges
are
conscious
of
the
relative
weakness
of
the
power
in
whose
name
they
act
and
they
are
more
inclined
to
abandon
a
right
of
jurisdiction
in
cases
where
it
is
justly
their
own
than
to
assert
a
privilege
to
which
they
have
no
legal
claim
different
cases
of
jurisdiction
the
matter
and
the
party
are
the
first
conditions
of
the
federal
suits
in
which
ambassadors
are
suits
of
the
of
a
separate
by
whom
causes
resulting
from
the
laws
of
the
why
judged
by
the
federal
causes
relating
to
the
of
contracts
tried
by
the
federal
consequences
of
this
arrangement
after
having
appointed
the
means
of
fixing
the
competency
of
the
federal
courts
the
legislators
of
the
union
defined
the
cases
which
should
come
within
their
jurisdiction
it
was
established
on
the
one
hand
that
certain
parties
must
always
be
brought
before
the
federal
courts
without
any
regard
to
the
special
nature
of
the
cause
and
on
the
other
that
certain
causes
must
always
be
brought
before
the
same
courts
without
any
regard
to
the
quality
of
the
parties
in
the
suit
these
distinctions
were
therefore
admitted
to
be
the
bases
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
ambassadors
are
the
representatives
of
nations
in
a
state
of
amity
with
the
union
and
whatever
concerns
these
personages
concerns
in
some
degree
the
whole
union
when
i
an
ambassador
is
a
party
in
a
suit
that
suit
affects
the
welfare
of
the
nation
and
a
federal
tribunal
is
naturally
called
upon
to
decide
it
the
union
itself
may
be
involved
in
legal
proceedings
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
alike
contrary
to
the
customs
of
all
nations
and
to
common
sense
to
appeal
to
a
tribunal
representing
any
other
sovereignty
than
its
own
the
federal
courts
therefore
take
cognizance
of
these
affairs
when
two
parties
belonging
to
two
different
states
are
engaged
in
a
suit
the
case
can
not
with
propriety
be
brought
before
a
court
of
either
state
the
surest
expedient
is
to
select
a
tribunal
like
that
of
the
union
which
can
excite
the
suspicions
of
neither
party
and
which
offers
the
most
natural
as
well
as
the
most
certain
remedy
when
the
two
parties
are
not
private
individuals
but
states
an
important
political
consideration
is
added
to
the
same
motive
of
equity
the
quality
of
the
parties
in
this
case
gives
a
national
importance
to
all
their
disputes
and
the
most
trifling
litigation
of
the
states
may
be
said
to
involve
the
peace
of
the
whole
union
the
nature
of
the
cause
frequently
prescribes
the
rule
of
competency
thus
all
the
questions
which
concern
maritime
commerce
evidently
fall
under
the
cognizance
of
the
federal
tribunals
almost
all
these
questions
are
connected
with
the
interpretation
of
the
law
of
nations
and
in
this
respect
they
essentially
interest
the
union
in
relation
to
foreign
powers
moreover
as
the
sea
is
not
included
within
the
limits
of
any
peculiar
jurisdiction
the
national
courts
can
only
hear
causes
which
originate
in
maritime
affairs
the
constitution
comprises
under
one
head
almost
all
the
cases
which
by
their
very
nature
come
within
the
limits
of
the
federal
courts
the
rule
which
it
lays
down
is
simple
but
pregnant
with
an
entire
system
of
ideas
and
with
a
vast
multitude
of
facts
it
declares
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
supreme
court
shall
extend
to
all
cases
in
law
and
equity
under
the
laws
of
the
united
two
examples
will
put
the
intentions
of
the
legislator
in
the
clearest
light
the
constitution
prohibits
the
states
from
making
laws
on
the
value
and
circulation
of
money
if
notwithstanding
this
prohibition
a
state
passes
a
law
of
this
kind
with
which
the
interested
parties
refuse
to
comply
because
it
is
contrary
to
the
constitution
the
case
must
come
before
a
federal
court
because
it
arises
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
again
if
difficulties
arise
in
the
levying
of
import
duties
which
have
been
voted
by
congress
the
federal
court
must
decide
the
case
because
it
arises
under
the
interpretation
of
a
law
of
the
united
states
this
rule
is
in
perfect
accordance
with
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
federal
constitution
the
union
as
it
was
established
in
possesses
it
is
true
a
limited
supremacy
but
it
was
intended
that
within
its
limits
it
should
form
one
and
the
same
people
within
those
limits
the
union
is
sovereign
when
this
point
is
established
and
admitted
the
inference
is
easy
for
if
it
be
acknowledged
that
the
united
states
constitute
one
and
the
same
people
within
the
bounds
prescribed
by
their
constitution
it
is
impossible
to
refuse
them
the
rights
which
belong
to
other
nations
but
it
has
been
allowed
from
the
origin
of
society
that
every
nation
has
the
right
of
deciding
by
its
own
courts
those
questions
which
concern
the
execution
of
its
own
laws
to
this
it
is
answered
that
the
union
is
in
so
singular
a
position
that
in
relation
to
some
matters
it
constitutes
a
people
and
that
in
relation
to
all
the
rest
it
is
a
nonentity
but
the
inference
to
be
drawn
is
that
in
the
laws
relating
to
these
matters
the
union
possesses
all
the
rights
of
absolute
sovereignty
the
difficulty
is
to
know
what
these
matters
are
and
when
once
it
is
resolved
and
we
have
shown
how
it
was
resolved
in
speaking
of
the
means
of
determining
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
no
farther
doubt
can
arise
for
as
soon
as
it
is
established
that
a
suit
is
federal
that
is
to
say
that
it
belongs
to
the
share
of
sovereignty
reserved
by
the
constitution
to
the
union
the
natural
consequence
is
that
it
should
come
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court
whenever
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
attacked
or
whenever
they
are
resorted
to
in
the
federal
courts
must
be
appealed
to
thus
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribunals
of
the
union
extends
and
narrows
its
limits
exactly
in
the
same
ratio
as
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
augments
or
decreases
we
have
shown
that
the
principal
aim
of
the
legislators
of
was
to
divide
the
sovereign
authority
into
two
parts
in
the
one
they
placed
the
control
of
all
the
general
interests
of
the
union
in
the
other
the
control
of
the
special
interest
of
its
component
states
their
chief
solicitude
was
to
arm
the
federal
government
with
sufficient
power
to
enable
it
to
resist
within
its
sphere
the
encroachments
of
the
several
states
as
for
these
communities
the
principle
of
independence
within
certain
limits
of
their
own
was
adopted
in
their
behalf
and
they
were
concealed
from
the
inspection
and
protected
from
the
control
of
the
central
government
in
speaking
of
the
division
of
the
authority
i
observed
that
this
latter
principle
had
not
always
been
held
sacred
since
the
states
are
prevented
from
passing
certain
laws
which
apparently
belong
to
their
own
particular
sphere
of
interest
when
a
state
of
the
union
passes
a
law
of
this
kind
the
citizens
who
are
injured
by
its
execution
can
appeal
to
the
federal
courts
the
remark
of
the
author
that
whenever
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
attacked
or
whenever
they
are
resorted
to
in
the
federal
courts
appealed
to
which
is
more
strongly
expressed
in
the
original
is
erroneous
and
calculated
to
mislead
on
a
point
of
some
importance
by
the
grant
of
power
to
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
decide
certain
cases
the
powers
of
the
state
courts
are
not
suspended
but
are
exercised
concurrently
subject
to
an
appeal
to
the
courts
of
the
united
states
but
if
the
decision
of
the
state
court
is
of
the
right
title
or
privilege
claimed
under
the
constitution
a
treaty
or
under
a
law
of
congress
no
appeal
lies
to
the
federal
courts
the
appeal
is
given
only
when
the
decision
the
claimant
under
the
treaty
or
law
see
cranch
wheaton
thus
the
jurisdiction
of
the
general
courts
extends
not
only
to
all
the
cases
which
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
union
but
also
to
those
which
arise
under
laws
made
by
the
several
states
in
opposition
to
the
constitution
the
states
are
prohibited
from
making
laws
in
criminal
cases
and
any
person
condemned
by
virtue
of
a
law
of
this
kind
can
appeal
to
the
judicial
power
of
the
union
the
states
are
likewise
prohibited
from
making
laws
which
may
have
a
tendency
to
impair
the
obligations
of
contracts
if
a
citizen
thinks
that
an
obligation
of
this
kind
is
impaired
by
a
law
passed
in
his
state
he
may
refuse
to
obey
it
and
may
appeal
to
the
federal
courts
this
provision
appears
to
me
to
be
the
most
serious
attack
upon
the
independence
of
the
states
the
rights
awarded
to
the
federal
government
for
purposes
of
obvious
national
importance
are
definite
and
easily
comprehensible
but
those
with
which
this
last
clause
invests
it
are
not
either
clearly
appreciable
or
accurately
defined
for
there
are
vast
numbers
of
political
laws
which
influence
the
obligations
of
contracts
which
may
thus
furnish
an
easy
pretext
for
the
aggressions
of
the
central
authority
the
fears
of
the
author
respecting
the
danger
to
the
independence
of
the
states
of
that
provision
of
the
constitution
which
gives
to
the
federal
courts
the
authority
of
deciding
when
a
state
law
impairs
the
obligation
of
a
contract
are
deemed
quite
unfounded
the
citizens
of
every
state
have
a
deep
interest
in
preserving
the
obligation
of
the
contracts
entered
into
by
them
in
other
states
indeed
without
such
a
controlling
power
commerce
among
several
states
could
not
exist
the
existence
of
this
common
arbiter
is
of
the
last
importance
to
the
continuance
of
the
union
itself
for
if
there
were
no
peaceable
means
of
enforcing
the
obligations
of
contracts
independent
of
all
state
authority
the
states
themselves
would
inevitably
come
in
collision
in
their
efforts
to
protect
their
respective
citizens
from
the
consequences
of
the
legislation
of
another
state
de
tocqueville
observation
that
the
rights
with
which
the
clause
in
question
invests
the
federal
government
are
not
clearly
appreciable
or
accurately
defined
proceeds
upon
a
mistaken
view
of
the
clause
itself
it
relates
to
the
of
a
contract
and
forbids
any
act
by
which
that
obligation
is
impaired
to
american
lawyers
this
seems
to
be
as
precise
and
definite
as
any
rule
can
be
made
by
human
language
the
distinction
between
the
to
the
fruits
of
a
contract
and
the
time
tribunal
and
manner
in
which
that
right
is
to
be
enforced
seems
very
palpable
at
all
events
since
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
those
cases
in
which
this
clause
has
been
discussed
no
difficulty
is
found
practically
in
understanding
the
exact
limits
of
the
prohibition
the
next
observation
of
the
author
that
there
are
vast
numbers
of
political
laws
which
influence
the
obligations
of
contracts
which
may
thus
furnish
an
easy
pretext
for
the
aggressions
of
the
central
authority
is
rather
obscure
is
it
intended
that
political
laws
may
be
passed
by
the
central
authority
influencing
the
obligation
of
a
contract
and
thus
the
contracts
themselves
be
destroyed
the
answer
to
this
would
be
that
the
question
would
not
arise
under
the
clause
forbidding
laws
impairing
the
obligation
of
contracts
for
that
clause
applies
only
to
the
states
and
not
to
the
federal
government
if
it
be
intended
that
the
states
may
find
it
necessary
to
pass
political
laws
which
affect
contracts
and
that
under
the
pretence
of
vindicating
the
obligation
of
contracts
the
central
authority
may
make
aggressions
on
the
states
and
annul
their
political
laws
the
answer
is
that
the
motive
to
the
adoption
of
the
clause
was
to
reach
laws
of
every
description
political
as
well
as
all
others
and
that
it
was
the
abuse
by
the
states
of
what
may
be
called
political
laws
viz
acts
confiscating
demands
of
foreign
creditors
that
gave
rise
to
the
prohibition
the
settled
doctrine
now
is
that
states
may
pass
laws
in
respect
to
the
making
of
contracts
may
prescribe
what
contracts
shall
be
made
and
how
but
that
they
can
not
impair
any
that
are
already
made
the
writer
of
this
note
is
unwilling
to
dismiss
the
subject
without
remarking
upon
what
he
must
think
a
fundamental
error
of
the
author
which
is
exhibited
in
the
passage
commented
on
as
well
as
in
other
passages
and
that
is
in
supposing
the
judiciary
of
the
united
states
and
particularly
the
supreme
court
to
be
a
part
of
the
federal
government
and
as
the
ready
instrument
to
execute
its
designs
upon
the
state
authorities
although
the
judges
are
in
form
commissioned
by
the
united
states
yet
in
fact
they
are
appointed
by
the
delegates
of
the
state
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
concurrently
with
and
acting
upon
the
nomination
of
the
president
if
the
legislature
of
each
state
in
the
union
were
to
elect
a
judge
of
the
supreme
court
he
would
not
be
less
a
political
officer
of
the
united
states
than
he
now
is
in
truth
the
judiciary
have
no
political
duties
to
perform
they
are
arbiters
chosen
by
the
federal
and
state
governments
jointly
and
when
appointed
as
independent
of
the
one
as
of
the
other
they
can
not
be
removed
without
the
consent
of
the
states
represented
in
the
senate
and
they
can
be
removed
without
the
consent
of
the
president
and
against
his
wishes
such
is
the
theory
of
the
constitution
and
it
has
been
felt
practically
in
the
rejection
by
the
senate
of
persons
nominated
as
judges
by
a
president
of
the
same
political
party
with
a
majority
of
the
senators
two
instances
of
this
kind
occurred
during
the
administration
of
jefferson
if
it
be
alleged
that
they
are
exposed
to
the
influence
of
the
executive
of
the
united
states
by
the
expectation
of
offices
in
his
gift
the
answer
is
that
judges
of
state
courts
are
equally
exposed
to
the
same
influence
that
all
state
officers
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
are
in
the
same
predicament
and
that
this
circumstance
does
not
therefore
deprive
them
of
the
character
of
impartial
and
independent
arbiters
these
observations
receive
confirmation
from
every
recent
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
which
certain
laws
of
individual
states
have
been
sustained
in
cases
where
to
say
the
least
it
was
very
questionable
whether
they
did
not
infringe
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
where
a
disposition
to
construe
those
previsions
broadly
and
extensively
would
have
found
very
plausible
grounds
to
indulge
itself
in
annulling
the
state
laws
referred
to
see
the
cases
of
of
new
york
the
bank
of
the
commonwealth
of
river
bridge
warren
procedure
of
the
federal
courts
natural
weakness
of
the
judiciary
power
in
legislators
ought
to
strive
as
much
as
possible
to
bring
private
individuals
and
not
states
before
the
federal
how
the
americans
have
succeeded
in
direct
prosecutions
of
private
individuals
in
the
federal
indirect
prosecution
in
the
states
which
violate
the
laws
of
the
the
decrees
of
the
supreme
court
enervate
but
do
not
destroy
the
provincial
laws
i
have
shown
what
the
privileges
of
the
federal
courts
are
and
it
is
no
less
important
to
point
out
the
manner
in
which
they
are
exercised
the
irresistible
authority
of
justice
in
countries
in
which
the
sovereignty
is
undivided
is
derived
from
the
fact
that
the
tribunals
of
those
countries
represent
the
entire
nation
at
issue
with
the
individual
against
whom
their
decree
is
directed
and
the
idea
of
power
is
thus
introduced
to
corroborate
the
idea
of
right
but
this
is
not
always
the
case
in
countries
in
which
the
sovereignty
is
divided
in
them
the
judicial
power
is
more
frequently
opposed
to
a
fraction
of
the
nation
than
to
an
isolated
individual
and
its
moral
authority
and
physical
strength
are
consequently
diminished
in
federal
states
the
power
of
the
judge
is
naturally
decreased
and
that
of
the
justiciable
parties
is
augmented
the
aim
of
the
legislator
in
confederate
states
ought
therefore
to
be
to
render
the
position
of
the
courts
of
justice
analogous
to
that
which
they
occupy
in
countries
where
the
sovereignty
is
undivided
in
other
words
his
efforts
ought
constantly
to
tend
to
maintain
the
judicial
power
of
the
confederation
as
the
representative
of
the
nation
and
the
justiciable
party
as
the
representative
of
an
individual
interest
every
government
whatever
may
be
its
constitution
requires
the
means
of
constraining
its
subjects
to
discharge
their
obligations
and
of
protecting
its
privileges
from
their
assaults
as
far
as
the
direct
action
of
the
government
on
the
community
is
concerned
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
contrived
by
a
of
policy
that
the
federal
courts
acting
in
the
name
of
the
laws
should
only
take
cognizance
of
parties
in
an
individual
capacity
for
as
it
had
been
declared
that
the
union
consisted
of
one
and
the
same
people
within
the
limits
laid
down
by
the
constitution
the
inference
was
that
the
government
created
by
this
constitution
and
acting
within
these
limits
was
invested
with
all
the
privileges
of
a
national
government
one
of
the
principal
of
which
is
the
right
of
transmitting
its
injunctions
directly
to
the
private
citizen
when
for
instance
the
union
votes
an
impost
it
does
not
apply
to
the
states
for
the
levying
of
it
but
to
every
american
citizen
in
proportion
to
his
assessment
the
supreme
court
which
is
empowered
to
enforce
the
execution
of
this
law
of
the
union
exerts
its
influence
not
upon
a
refractory
state
but
upon
the
private
taxpayer
and
like
the
judicial
power
of
other
nations
it
is
opposed
to
the
person
of
an
individual
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
union
chose
its
own
antagonist
and
as
that
antagonist
is
feeble
he
is
naturally
worsted
but
the
difficulty
increases
when
the
proceedings
are
not
brought
forward
but
the
union
the
constitution
recognizes
the
legislative
power
of
the
state
and
a
law
so
enacted
may
impair
the
privileges
of
the
union
in
which
case
a
collision
is
unavoidable
between
that
body
and
the
state
which
had
passed
the
law
and
it
only
remains
to
select
the
least
dangerous
remedy
which
is
very
clearly
deducible
from
the
general
principles
i
have
before
established
it
may
be
conceived
that
in
the
case
under
consideration
the
union
might
have
sued
the
state
before
a
federal
court
which
would
have
annulled
the
act
and
by
this
means
it
would
have
adopted
a
natural
course
of
proceeding
but
the
judicial
power
would
have
been
placed
in
open
hostility
to
the
state
and
it
was
desirable
to
avoid
this
predicament
as
much
as
possible
the
americans
hold
that
it
is
nearly
impossible
that
a
new
law
should
not
impair
the
interests
of
some
private
individuals
by
its
provisions
these
private
interests
are
assumed
by
the
american
legislators
as
the
ground
of
attack
against
such
measures
as
may
be
prejudicial
to
the
union
and
it
is
to
these
cases
that
the
protection
of
the
supreme
court
is
extended
suppose
a
state
vends
a
certain
portion
of
its
territory
to
a
company
and
that
a
year
afterwards
it
passes
a
law
by
which
the
territory
is
otherwise
disposed
of
and
that
clause
of
the
constitution
which
prohibits
laws
impairing
the
obligation
of
contracts
is
violated
when
the
purchaser
under
the
second
act
appears
to
take
possession
the
possessor
under
the
first
act
brings
his
action
before
the
tribunals
of
the
union
and
causes
the
title
of
the
claimant
to
be
pronounced
null
and
void
this
in
point
of
fact
the
judicial
power
of
the
union
is
contesting
the
claims
of
the
sovereignty
of
a
state
but
it
only
acts
indirectly
and
upon
a
special
application
of
detail
it
attacks
the
law
in
its
consequences
not
in
its
principle
and
it
rather
weakens
than
destroys
it
the
last
hypothesis
that
remained
was
that
each
state
formed
a
corporation
enjoying
a
separate
existence
and
distinct
civil
rights
and
that
it
could
therefore
sue
or
be
sued
before
a
tribunal
thus
a
state
could
bring
an
action
against
another
state
in
this
instance
the
union
was
not
called
upon
to
contest
a
provincial
law
but
to
try
a
suit
in
which
a
state
was
a
party
this
suit
was
perfectly
similar
to
any
other
cause
except
that
the
quality
of
the
parties
was
different
and
here
the
danger
pointed
out
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
exists
with
less
chance
of
being
avoided
the
inherent
disadvantage
of
the
very
essence
of
federal
constitutions
is
that
they
engender
parties
in
the
bosom
of
the
nation
which
present
powerful
obstacles
to
the
free
course
of
justice
high
rank
of
the
supreme
courts
among
the
great
powers
of
state
no
nation
ever
constituted
so
great
a
judicial
power
as
the
americans
extent
of
its
its
political
the
tranquillity
and
the
very
existence
of
the
union
depend
on
the
discretion
of
the
seven
federal
judges
when
we
have
successfully
examined
in
detail
the
organization
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
entire
prerogatives
which
it
exercises
we
shall
readily
admit
that
a
more
imposing
judicial
power
was
never
constituted
by
any
people
the
supreme
court
is
placed
at
the
head
of
all
known
tribunals
both
by
the
nature
of
its
rights
and
the
class
of
justiciable
parties
which
it
controls
in
all
the
civilized
countries
of
europe
the
government
has
always
shown
the
greatest
repugnance
to
allow
the
cases
to
which
it
was
itself
a
party
to
be
decided
by
the
ordinary
course
of
justice
this
repugnance
naturally
attains
its
utmost
height
in
an
absolute
government
and
on
the
other
hand
the
privileges
of
the
courts
of
justice
are
extended
with
the
increasing
liberties
of
the
people
but
no
european
nation
has
at
present
held
that
all
judicial
controversies
without
regard
to
their
origin
can
be
decided
by
the
judges
of
common
law
in
america
this
theory
has
been
actually
put
in
practice
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
is
the
sole
tribunal
of
the
nation
its
power
extends
to
all
the
cases
arising
under
laws
and
treaties
made
by
the
executive
and
legislative
authorities
to
all
cases
of
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
and
in
general
to
all
points
which
affect
the
law
of
nations
it
may
even
be
affirmed
that
although
its
constitution
is
essentially
judicial
its
prerogatives
are
almost
entirely
political
its
sole
object
is
to
enforce
the
execution
of
the
laws
of
the
union
and
the
union
only
regulates
the
relations
of
the
government
with
the
citizens
and
of
the
nation
with
foreign
powers
the
relations
of
citizens
among
themselves
are
almost
exclusively
regulated
by
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
a
second
and
still
greater
cause
of
the
preponderance
of
this
court
may
be
adduced
in
the
nations
of
europe
the
courts
of
justice
are
only
called
upon
to
try
the
controversies
of
private
individuals
but
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
summons
sovereign
powers
to
its
bar
when
the
clerk
of
the
court
advances
on
the
steps
of
the
tribunal
and
simply
says
the
state
of
new
york
the
state
of
ohio
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
that
the
court
which
he
addresses
is
no
ordinary
body
and
when
it
is
recollected
that
one
of
these
parties
represents
one
million
and
the
other
two
millions
of
men
one
is
struck
by
the
responsibility
of
the
seven
judges
whose
decision
is
about
to
satisfy
or
to
disappoint
so
large
a
number
of
their
the
peace
the
prosperity
and
the
very
existence
of
the
union
are
invested
in
the
hands
of
the
seven
judges
without
their
active
the
constitution
would
be
a
dead
letter
the
executive
appeals
to
them
for
assistance
against
the
encroachments
of
the
legislative
powers
the
legislature
demands
their
protection
from
the
designs
of
the
executive
they
defend
the
union
from
the
disobedience
of
the
states
the
states
from
the
exaggerated
claims
of
the
union
the
public
interest
against
the
interests
of
private
citizens
and
the
conservative
spirit
of
order
against
the
fleeting
innovations
of
democracy
their
power
is
enormous
but
it
is
clothed
in
the
authority
of
public
opinion
they
are
the
guardians
of
a
people
which
respects
law
but
they
would
be
impotent
against
popular
neglect
or
popular
contempt
the
force
of
public
opinion
is
the
most
intractable
of
agents
because
its
exact
limits
can
not
be
defined
and
it
is
not
less
dangerous
to
exceed
than
to
remain
below
the
boundary
prescribed
the
federal
judges
must
not
only
be
good
citizens
and
men
possessed
of
that
information
and
integrity
which
are
indispensable
to
magistrates
but
they
must
be
statesmen
politicians
not
unread
in
the
signs
of
the
times
not
afraid
to
brave
the
obstacles
which
can
be
subdued
nor
slow
to
turn
aside
such
encroaching
elements
as
may
threaten
the
supremacy
of
the
union
and
the
obedience
which
is
due
to
the
laws
the
president
who
exercises
a
limited
power
may
err
without
causing
great
mischief
in
the
state
congress
may
decide
amiss
without
destroying
the
union
because
the
electoral
body
in
which
congress
originates
may
cause
it
to
retract
its
decision
by
changing
its
members
but
if
the
supreme
court
is
ever
composed
of
imprudent
men
or
bad
citizens
the
union
may
be
plunged
into
anarchy
or
civil
war
the
real
cause
of
this
danger
however
does
not
lie
in
the
constitution
of
the
tribunal
but
in
the
very
nature
of
federal
governments
we
have
observed
that
in
confederate
peoples
it
is
especially
necessary
to
consolidate
the
judicial
authority
because
in
no
other
nations
do
those
independent
persons
who
are
able
to
cope
with
the
social
body
exist
in
greater
power
or
in
a
better
condition
to
resist
the
physical
strength
of
the
government
but
the
more
a
power
requires
to
be
strengthened
the
more
extensive
and
independent
it
must
be
made
and
the
dangers
which
its
abuse
may
create
are
heightened
by
its
independence
and
its
strength
the
source
of
the
evil
is
not
therefore
in
the
constitution
of
the
power
but
in
the
constitution
of
those
states
which
renders
its
existence
necessary
in
what
respects
the
federal
constitution
is
superior
to
that
of
the
states
in
what
respects
the
constitution
of
the
union
can
be
compared
to
that
of
the
superiority
of
the
constitution
of
the
union
attributable
to
the
wisdom
of
the
federal
legislature
of
the
union
less
dependent
on
the
people
than
that
of
the
executive
power
more
independent
in
its
judicial
power
less
subjected
to
the
inclinations
of
the
practical
consequences
of
these
the
dangers
inherent
in
a
democratic
government
eluded
by
the
federal
legislators
and
increased
by
the
legislators
of
the
states
the
federal
constitution
differs
essentially
from
that
of
the
states
in
the
ends
which
it
is
intended
to
accomplish
but
in
the
means
by
which
these
ends
are
promoted
a
greater
analogy
exists
between
them
the
objects
of
the
governments
are
different
but
their
forms
are
the
same
and
in
this
special
point
of
view
there
is
some
advantage
in
comparing
them
together
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
federal
constitution
is
superior
to
all
the
constitutions
of
the
states
for
several
reasons
the
present
constitution
of
the
union
was
formed
at
a
later
period
than
those
of
the
majority
of
the
states
and
it
may
have
derived
some
melioration
from
past
experience
but
we
shall
be
led
to
acknowledge
that
this
is
only
a
secondary
cause
of
its
superiority
when
we
recollect
that
eleven
new
states
have
been
added
to
the
american
confederation
since
the
promulgation
of
the
federal
constitution
and
that
these
new
republics
have
always
rather
exaggerated
than
avoided
the
defects
which
existed
in
the
former
constitutions
the
chief
cause
of
the
superiority
of
the
federal
constitution
lay
in
the
character
of
the
legislators
who
composed
it
at
the
time
when
it
was
formed
the
dangers
of
the
confederation
were
imminent
and
its
ruin
seemed
inevitable
in
this
extremity
the
people
chose
the
men
who
most
deserved
the
esteem
rather
than
those
who
had
gained
the
affections
of
the
country
i
have
already
observed
that
distinguished
as
almost
all
the
legislators
of
the
union
were
for
their
intelligence
they
were
still
more
so
for
their
patriotism
they
had
all
been
nurtured
at
a
time
when
the
spirit
of
liberty
was
braced
by
a
continual
struggle
against
a
powerful
and
predominant
authority
when
the
contest
was
terminated
while
the
excited
passions
of
the
populace
persisted
in
warring
with
dangers
which
had
ceased
to
threaten
them
these
men
stopped
short
in
their
career
they
cast
a
calmer
and
more
penetrating
look
upon
the
country
which
was
now
their
own
they
perceived
that
the
war
of
independence
was
definitely
ended
and
that
the
only
dangers
which
america
had
to
fear
were
those
which
might
result
from
the
abuse
of
the
freedom
she
had
won
they
had
the
courage
to
say
what
they
believed
to
be
true
because
they
were
animated
by
a
warm
and
sincere
love
of
liberty
and
they
ventured
to
propose
restrictions
because
they
were
resolutely
opposed
to
destruction
the
greater
number
of
the
constitutions
of
the
states
assign
one
year
for
the
duration
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
two
years
for
that
of
the
senate
so
that
members
of
the
legislative
body
are
constantly
and
narrowly
tied
down
by
the
slightest
desires
of
their
constituents
the
legislators
of
the
union
were
of
opinion
that
this
excessive
dependence
of
the
legislature
tended
to
alter
the
nature
of
the
main
consequences
of
the
representative
system
since
it
vested
the
source
not
only
of
authority
but
of
government
in
the
people
they
increased
the
length
of
the
time
for
which
the
representatives
were
returned
in
order
to
give
them
freer
scope
for
the
exercise
of
their
own
judgment
the
federal
constitution
as
well
as
the
constitutions
of
the
different
states
divided
the
legislative
body
into
two
branches
but
in
the
states
these
two
branches
were
composed
of
the
same
elements
and
elected
in
the
same
manner
the
consequence
was
that
the
passions
and
inclinations
of
the
populace
were
as
rapidly
and
as
energetically
represented
in
one
chamber
as
in
the
other
and
that
laws
were
made
with
all
the
characteristics
of
violence
and
precipitation
by
the
federal
constitution
the
two
houses
originate
in
like
manner
in
the
choice
of
the
people
but
the
conditions
of
eligibility
and
the
mode
of
election
were
changed
to
the
end
that
if
as
is
the
case
in
certain
nations
one
branch
of
the
legislature
represents
the
same
interests
as
the
other
it
may
at
least
represent
a
superior
degree
of
intelligence
and
discretion
a
mature
age
was
made
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
senatorial
dignity
and
the
upper
house
was
chosen
by
an
elected
assembly
of
a
limited
number
of
members
to
concentrate
the
whole
social
force
in
the
hands
of
the
legislative
body
is
the
natural
tendency
of
democracies
for
as
this
is
the
power
which
emanates
the
most
directly
from
the
people
it
is
made
to
participate
most
fully
in
the
preponderating
authority
of
the
multitude
and
it
is
naturally
led
to
monopolise
every
species
of
influence
this
concentration
is
at
once
prejudicial
to
a
administration
and
favorable
to
the
despotism
of
the
majority
the
legislators
of
the
states
frequently
yielded
to
these
democratic
propensities
which
were
invariably
and
courageously
resisted
by
the
founders
of
the
union
in
the
states
the
executive
power
is
vested
in
the
hands
of
a
magistrate
who
is
apparently
placed
upon
a
level
with
the
legislature
but
who
is
in
reality
nothing
more
than
the
blind
agent
and
the
passive
instrument
of
its
decisions
he
can
derive
no
influence
from
the
duration
of
his
functions
which
terminate
with
the
revolving
year
or
from
the
exercise
of
prerogatives
which
can
scarcely
be
said
to
exist
the
legislature
can
condemn
him
to
inaction
by
intrusting
the
execution
of
the
laws
to
special
committees
of
its
own
members
and
can
annul
his
temporary
dignity
by
depriving
him
of
his
salary
the
federal
constitution
vests
all
the
privileges
and
all
the
responsibility
of
the
executive
power
in
a
single
individual
the
duration
of
the
presidency
is
fixed
at
four
years
the
salary
of
the
individual
who
fills
that
office
can
not
be
altered
during
the
term
of
his
functions
he
is
protected
by
a
body
of
official
dependents
and
armed
with
a
suspensive
veto
in
short
every
effort
was
made
to
confer
a
strong
and
independent
position
upon
the
executive
authority
within
the
limits
which
had
been
prescribed
to
it
in
the
constitution
of
all
the
states
the
judicial
power
is
that
which
remains
the
most
independent
of
the
legislative
authority
nevertheless
in
all
the
states
the
legislature
has
reserved
to
itself
the
right
of
regulating
the
emoluments
of
the
judges
a
practice
which
necessarily
subjects
these
magistrates
to
its
immediate
influence
in
some
states
the
judges
are
only
temporarily
appointed
which
deprives
them
of
a
great
portion
of
their
power
and
their
freedom
in
others
the
legislative
and
judicial
powers
are
entirely
confounded
thus
the
senate
of
new
york
for
instance
constitutes
in
certain
cases
the
superior
court
of
the
state
the
federal
constitution
on
the
other
hand
carefully
separates
the
judicial
authority
from
all
external
influences
and
it
provides
for
the
independence
of
the
judges
by
declaring
that
their
salary
shall
not
be
altered
and
that
their
functions
shall
be
inalienable
it
is
not
universally
correct
as
supposed
by
the
author
that
the
state
legislatures
can
deprive
their
governor
of
his
salary
at
pleasure
in
the
constitution
of
new
york
it
is
provided
that
the
governor
shall
receive
for
his
services
a
compensation
which
shall
neither
be
increased
nor
diminished
during
the
term
for
which
he
shall
have
been
elected
and
similar
provisions
are
believed
to
exist
in
other
states
nor
is
the
remark
strictly
correct
that
the
federal
constitution
provides
for
the
independence
of
the
judges
by
declaring
that
their
salary
shall
not
be
the
provision
of
the
constitution
is
that
they
shall
at
stated
times
receive
for
their
services
a
compensation
which
shall
not
be
diminished
during
their
continuance
in
office
the
practical
consequences
of
these
different
systems
may
easily
be
perceived
an
attentive
observer
will
soon
remark
that
the
business
of
the
union
is
incomparably
better
conducted
than
that
of
any
individual
state
the
conduct
of
the
federal
government
is
more
fair
and
more
temperate
than
that
of
the
states
its
designs
are
more
fraught
with
wisdom
its
projects
are
more
durable
and
more
skilfully
combined
its
measures
are
put
into
execution
with
more
vigor
and
consistency
i
recapitulate
the
substance
of
this
chapter
in
a
few
words
the
existence
of
democracies
is
threatened
by
two
dangers
viz
the
complete
subjection
of
the
legislative
body
to
the
caprices
of
the
electoral
body
and
the
concentration
of
all
the
powers
of
the
government
in
the
legislative
authority
the
growth
of
these
evils
has
been
encouraged
by
the
policy
of
the
legislators
of
the
states
but
it
has
been
resisted
by
the
legislators
of
the
union
by
every
means
which
lay
within
their
control
characteristics
which
distinguish
the
federal
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america
from
all
other
federal
constitutions
american
union
appears
to
resemble
all
other
nevertheless
its
effects
are
reason
of
distinctions
between
the
union
and
all
other
the
american
government
not
a
federal
but
an
imperfect
national
government
the
united
states
of
america
do
not
afford
either
the
first
or
the
only
instance
of
confederate
states
several
of
which
have
existed
in
modern
europe
without
adverting
to
those
of
antiquity
switzerland
the
germanic
empire
and
the
republic
of
the
united
provinces
either
have
been
or
still
are
confederations
in
studying
the
constitutions
of
these
different
countries
the
politician
is
surprised
to
observe
that
the
powers
with
which
they
invested
the
federal
government
are
nearly
identical
with
the
privileges
awarded
by
the
american
constitution
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
they
confer
upon
the
central
power
the
same
rights
of
making
peace
and
war
of
raising
money
and
troops
and
of
providing
for
the
general
exigencies
and
the
common
interests
of
the
nation
nevertheless
the
federal
government
of
these
different
people
has
always
been
as
remarkable
for
its
weakness
and
inefficiency
as
that
of
the
union
is
for
its
vigorous
and
enterprising
spirit
again
the
first
american
confederation
perished
through
the
excessive
weakness
of
its
government
and
this
weak
government
was
notwithstanding
in
possession
of
rights
even
more
extensive
than
those
of
the
federal
government
of
the
present
day
but
the
more
recent
constitution
of
the
united
states
contains
certain
principles
which
exercise
a
most
important
influence
although
they
do
not
at
once
strike
the
observer
this
constitution
which
may
at
first
sight
be
confounded
with
the
federal
constitutions
which
preceded
it
rests
upon
a
novel
theory
which
may
be
considered
as
a
great
invention
in
modern
political
science
in
all
the
confederations
which
had
been
formed
before
the
american
constitution
of
the
allied
states
agreed
to
obey
the
injunctions
of
a
federal
government
but
they
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
of
ordaining
and
enforcing
the
execution
of
the
laws
of
the
union
the
american
states
which
combined
in
agreed
that
the
federal
government
should
not
only
dictate
the
laws
but
it
should
execute
its
own
enactments
in
both
cases
the
right
is
the
same
but
the
exercise
of
the
right
is
different
and
this
alteration
produced
the
most
momentous
consequences
in
all
the
confederations
which
have
been
formed
before
the
american
union
the
federal
government
demanded
its
supplies
at
the
hands
of
the
separate
governments
and
if
the
measure
it
prescribed
was
onerous
to
any
one
of
those
bodies
means
were
found
to
evade
its
claims
if
the
state
was
powerful
it
had
recourse
to
arms
if
it
was
weak
it
connived
at
the
resistance
which
the
law
of
the
union
its
sovereign
met
with
and
resorted
to
inaction
under
the
plea
of
inability
under
these
circumstances
one
of
two
alternatives
has
invariably
occurred
either
the
most
preponderant
of
the
allied
peoples
has
assumed
the
privileges
of
the
federal
authority
and
ruled
all
the
other
states
in
its
name
or
the
federal
government
has
been
abandoned
by
its
natural
supporters
anarchy
has
arisen
between
the
confederates
and
the
union
has
lost
all
power
of
action
in
america
the
subjects
of
the
union
are
not
states
but
private
citizens
the
national
government
levies
a
tax
not
upon
the
state
of
massachusetts
but
upon
each
inhabitant
of
massachusetts
all
former
confederate
governments
presided
over
communities
but
that
of
the
union
rules
individuals
its
force
is
not
borrowed
but
and
it
is
served
by
its
own
civil
and
military
officers
by
its
own
army
and
its
own
courts
of
justice
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
spirit
of
the
nation
the
passions
of
the
multitude
and
the
provincial
prejudices
of
each
state
tend
singularly
to
diminish
the
authority
of
a
federal
authority
thus
constituted
and
to
facilitate
the
means
of
resistance
to
its
mandates
but
the
comparative
weakness
of
a
restricted
sovereignty
is
an
evil
inherent
in
the
federal
system
in
america
each
state
has
fewer
opportunities
of
resistance
and
fewer
temptations
to
nor
can
such
a
design
be
put
in
execution
if
indeed
it
be
entertained
without
an
open
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
union
a
direct
interruption
of
the
ordinary
course
of
justice
and
a
bold
declaration
of
revolt
in
a
word
without
a
decisive
step
which
men
hesitate
to
adopt
in
all
former
confederations
the
privileges
of
the
union
furnished
more
elements
of
discord
than
of
power
since
they
multiplied
the
claims
of
the
nation
without
augmenting
the
means
of
enforcing
them
and
in
accordance
with
this
fact
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
real
weakness
of
federal
governments
has
almost
always
been
in
the
exact
ratio
of
their
nominal
power
such
is
not
the
case
with
the
american
union
in
which
as
in
ordinary
governments
the
federal
government
has
the
means
of
enforcing
all
it
is
empowered
to
demand
the
human
understanding
more
easily
invents
new
things
than
new
words
and
we
are
thence
constrained
to
employ
a
multitude
of
improper
and
inadequate
expressions
when
several
nations
form
a
permanent
league
and
establish
a
supreme
authority
which
although
it
has
not
the
same
influence
over
the
members
of
the
community
as
a
national
government
acts
upon
each
of
the
confederate
states
in
a
body
this
government
which
is
so
essentially
different
from
all
others
is
denominated
a
federal
one
another
form
of
society
is
afterward
discovered
in
which
several
peoples
are
fused
into
one
and
the
same
nation
with
regard
to
certain
common
interests
although
they
remain
distinct
or
at
least

with
regard
to
all
their
other
concerns
in
this
case
the
central
power
acts
directly
upon
those
whom
it
governs
whom
it
rules
and
whom
it
judges
in
the
same
manner
as
but
in
a
more
limited
circle
than
a
national
government
here
the
term
of
federal
government
is
clearly
no
longer
applicable
to
a
state
of
things
which
must
be
styled
an
incomplete
national
government
a
form
of
government
has
been
found
out
which
is
neither
exactly
national
nor
federal
but
no
farther
progress
has
been
made
and
the
new
word
which
will
one
day
designate
this
novel
invention
does
not
yet
exist
the
absence
of
this
new
species
of
confederation
has
been
the
cause
which
has
brought
all
unions
to
civil
war
to
subjection
or
to
a
stagnant
apathy
and
the
peoples
which
formed
these
leagues
have
been
either
too
dull
to
discern
or
too
pusillanimous
to
apply
this
great
remedy
the
american
confederation
perished
by
the
same
defects
but
the
confederate
states
of
america
had
been
long
accustomed
to
form
a
portion
of
one
empire
before
they
had
won
their
independence
they
had
not
contracted
the
habit
of
governing
themselves
and
their
national
prejudices
had
not
taken
deep
root
in
their
minds
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
world
in
political
knowledge
and
sharing
that
knowledge
equally
among
themselves
they
were
little
agitated
by
the
passions
which
generally
oppose
the
extension
of
federal
authority
in
a
nation
and
those
passions
were
checked
by
the
wisdom
of
the
chief
citizens
the
americans
applied
the
remedy
with
prudent
firmness
as
soon
as
they
were
conscious
of
the
evil
they
amended
their
laws
and
they
saved
their
country
advantages
of
the
federal
system
in
general
and
its
special
utility

and

of

to

the

from

and
from
a
large
advantages

by
the

states
from
this
the
law

itself
to
the
exigencies
of
the
population
population

not
conform
to
the
exigencies
of
the
activity

love
and
enjoyment
of
freedom
in
the
american
public
spirit
of
the
union
the
abstract
of
provincial
principles
and
things
circulate
freely
over
the
territory
of
the
united
the
union
is
happy
and
free
as
a
little
nation
and
respected
as
a
great
empire
in
small
nations
the
scrutiny
of
society
penetrates
into
every
part
and
the
spirit
of
improvement
enters
into
the
most
trifling
details
as
the
ambition
of
the
people
is
necessarily
checked
by
its
weakness
all
the
efforts
and
resources
of
the
citizens
are
turned
to
the
internal
benefit
of
the
community
and
are
not
likely
to
evaporate
in
the
fleeting
breath
of
glory
the
desires
of
every
individual
are
limited
because
extraordinary
faculties
are
rarely
to
be
met
with
the
gifts
of
an
equal
fortune
render
the
various
conditions
of
life
uniform
and
the
manners
of
the
inhabitants
are
orderly
and
simple
thus
if
we
estimate
the
gradations
of
popular
morality
and
enlightenment
we
shall
generally
find
that
in
small
nations
there
are
more
persons
in
easy
circumstances
a
more
numerous
population
and
a
more
tranquil
state
of
society
than
in
great
empires
when
tyranny
is
established
in
the
bosom
of
a
small
nation
it
is
more
galling
than
elsewhere
because
as
it
acts
within
a
narrow
circle
every
point
of
that
circle
is
subject
to
its
direct
influence
it
supplies
the
place
of
those
great
designs
which
it
can
not
entertain
by
a
violent
or
an
exasperating
interference
in
a
multitude
of
minute
details
and
it
leaves
the
political
world
to
which
it
properly
belongs
to
meddle
with
the
arrangements
of
domestic
life
tastes
as
well
as
actions
are
to
be
regulated
at
its
pleasure
and
the
families
of
the
citizens
as
well
as
the
affairs
of
the
state
are
to
be
governed
by
its
decisions
this
invasion
of
rights
occurs
however
but
seldom
and
freedom
is
in
truth
the
natural
state
of
small
communities
the
temptations
which
the
government
offers
to
ambition
are
too
weak
and
the
resources
of
private
individuals
are
too
slender
for
the
sovereign
power
easily
to
fall
within
the
grasp
of
a
single
citizen
and
should
such
an
event
have
occurred
the
subjects
of
the
state
can
without
difficulty
overthrow
the
tyrant
and
his
oppression
by
a
simultaneous
effort
small
nations
have
therefore
ever
been
the
cradles
of
political
liberty
and
the
fact
that
many
of
them
have
lost
their
immunities
by
extending
their
dominion
shows
that
the
freedom
they
enjoyed
was
more
a
consequence
of
their
inferior
size
than
of
the
character
of
the
people
the
history
of
the
world
affords
no
instance
of
a
great
nation
retaining
the
form
of
a
republican
government
for
a
long
series
of
years
and
this
had
led
to
the
conclusion
that
such
a
state
of
things
is
impracticable
for
my
own
part
i
can
not
but
censure
the
imprudence
of
attempting
to
limit
the
possible
and
to
judge
the
future
on
the
part
of
a
being
who
is
hourly
deceived
by
the
most
palpable
realities
of
life
and
who
is
constantly
taken
by
surprise
in
the
circumstances
with
which
he
is
most
familiar
but
it
may
be
advanced
with
confidence
that
the
existence
of
a
great
republic
will
always
be
exposed
to
far
greater
perils
than
that
of
a
small
one
all
the
passions
which
are
most
fatal
to
republican
institutions
spread
with
an
increasing
territory
while
the
virtues
which
maintain
their
dignity
do
not
augment
in
the
same
proportion
the
ambition
of
the
citizens
increases
with
the
power
of
the
state
the
strength
of
parties
with
the
importance
of
the
ends
they
have
in
view
but
that
devotion
to
the
common
weal
which
is
the
surest
check
on
destructive
passions
is
not
stronger
in
a
large
than
in
a
small
republic
it
might
indeed
be
proved
without
difficulty
that
it
is
less
powerful
and
less
sincere
the
arrogance
of
wealth
and
the
dejection
of
wretchedness
capital
cities
of
unwonted
extent
a
lax
morality
a
vulgar
egotism
and
a
great
confusion
of
interests
are
the
dangers
which
almost
invariably
arise
from
the
magnitude
of
states
but
several
of
these
evils
are
scarcely
prejudicial
to
a
monarchy
and
some
of
them
contribute
to
maintain
its
existence
in
monarchical
states
the
strength
of
the
government
is
its
own
it
may
use
but
it
does
not
depend
on
the
community
and
the
authority
of
the
prince
is
proportioned
to
the
prosperity
of
the
nation
but
the
only
security
which
a
republican
government
possesses
against
these
evils
lies
in
the
support
of
the
majority
this
support
is
not
however
proportionably
greater
in
a
large
republic
than
it
is
in
a
small
one
and
thus
while
the
means
of
attack
perpetually
increase
both
in
number
and
in
influence
the
power
of
resistance
remains
the
same
or
it
may
rather
be
said
to
diminish
since
the
propensities
and
interests
of
the
people
are
diversified
by
the
increase
of
the
population
and
the
difficulty
of
forming
a
compact
majority
is
constantly
augmented
it
has
been
observed
moreover
that
the
intensity
of
human
passions
is
heightened
not
only
by
the
importance
of
the
end
which
they
propose
to
attain
but
by
the
multitude
of
individuals
who
are
animated
by
them
at
the
same
time
every
one
has
had
occasion
to
remark
that
his
emotions
in
the
midst
of
a
sympathizing
crowd
are
far
greater
than
those
which
he
would
have
felt
in
solitude
in
great
republics
the
impetus
of
political
passion
is
irresistible
not
only
because
it
aims
at
gigantic
purposes
but
because
it
is
felt
and
shared
by
millions
of
men
at
the
same
time
it
may
therefore
be
asserted
as
a
general
proposition
that
nothing
is
more
opposed
to
the
and
the
freedom
of
man
than
vast
empires
nevertheless
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
the
peculiar
advantages
of
great
states
for
the
very
reason
which
renders
the
desire
of
power
more
intense
in
these
communities
than
among
ordinary
men
the
love
of
glory
is
also
more
prominent
in
the
hearts
of
a
class
of
citizens
who
regard
the
applause
of
a
great
people
as
a
reward
worthy
of
their
exertions
and
an
elevating
encouragement
to
man
if
we
would
learn
why
it
is
that
great
nations
contribute
more
powerfully
to
the
spread
of
human
improvement
than
small
states
we
shall
discover
an
adequate
cause
in
the
rapid
and
energetic
circulation
of
ideas
and
in
those
great
cities
which
are
the
intellectual
centres
where
all
the
rays
of
human
genius
are
reflected
and
combined
to
this
it
may
be
added
that
most
important
discoveries
demand
a
display
of
national
power
which
the
government
of
a
small
state
is
unable
to
make
in
great
nations
the
government
entertains
a
greater
number
of
general
notions
and
is
more
completely
disengaged
from
the
routine
of
precedent
and
the
egotism
of
local
prejudice
its
designs
are
conceived
with
more
talent
and
executed
with
more
boldness
in
time
of
peace
the
of
small
nations
is
undoubtedly
more
general
and
more
complete
but
they
are
apt
to
suffer
more
acutely
from
the
calamities
of
war
than
those
great
empires
whose
distant
frontiers
may
for
ages
avert
the
presence
of
the
danger
from
the
mass
of
the
people
which
is
more
frequently
afflicted
than
ruined
by
the
evil
but
in
this
matter
as
in
many
others
the
argument
derived
from
the
necessity
of
the
case
predominates
over
all
others
if
none
but
small
nations
existed
i
do
not
doubt
that
mankind
would
be
more
happy
and
more
free
but
the
existence
of
great
nations
is
unavoidable
this
consideration
introduces
the
element
of
physical
strength
as
a
condition
of
national
prosperity
it
profits
a
people
but
little
to
be
affluent
and
free
if
it
is
perpetually
exposed
to
be
pillaged
or
subjugated
the
number
of
its
manufactures
and
the
extent
of
its
commerce
are
of
small
advantage
if
another
nation
has
the
empire
of
the
seas
and
gives
the
law
in
all
the
markets
of
the
globe
small
nations
are
often
impoverished
not
because
they
are
small
but
because
they
are
weak
and
great
empires
prosper
less
because
they
are
great
than
because
they
are
strong
physical
strength
is
therefore
one
of
the
first
conditions
of
the
happiness
and
even
of
the
existence
of
nations
hence
it
occurs
that
unless
very
peculiar
circumstances
intervene
small
nations
are
always
united
to
large
empires
in
the
end
either
by
force
or
by
their
own
consent
yet
i
am
unacquainted
with
a
more
deplorable
spectacle
than
that
of
a
people
unable
either
to
defend
or
to
maintain
its
independence
the
federal
system
was
created
with
the
intention
of
combining
the
different
advantages
which
result
from
the
greater
and
the
lesser
extent
of
nations
and
a
single
glance
over
the
united
states
of
america
suffices
to
discover
the
advantages
which
they
have
derived
from
its
adoption
in
great
centralized
nations
the
legislator
is
obliged
to
impart
a
character
of
uniformity
to
the
laws
which
does
not
always
suit
the
diversity
of
customs
and
of
districts
as
he
takes
no
cognizance
of
special
cases
he
can
only
proceed
upon
general
principles
and
the
population
is
obliged
to
conform
to
the
exigencies
of
the
legislation
since
the
legislation
can
not
adapt
itself
to
the
exigencies
and
customs
of
the
population
which
is
the
cause
of
endless
trouble
and
misery
this
disadvantage
does
not
exist
in
confederations
congress
regulates
the
principal
measures
of
the
national
government
and
all
the
details
of
the
administration
are
reserved
to
the
provincial
legislatures
it
is
impossible
to
imaging
how
much
this
division
of
sovereignty
contributes
to
the
of
each
of
the
states
which
compose
the
union
in
these
small
communities
which
are
never
agitated
by
the
desire
of
aggrandizement
or
the
cares
of
all
public
authority
and
private
energy
is
employed
in
internal
melioration
the
central
government
of
each
state
which
is
in
immediate
juxtaposition
to
the
citizens
is
daily
apprised
of
the
wants
which
arise
in
society
and
new
projects
are
proposed
every
year
which
are
discussed
either
at
or
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
and
which
are
transmitted
by
the
press
to
stimulate
the
zeal
and
to
excite
the
interest
of
the
citizens
this
spirit
of
melioration
is
constantly
alive
in
the
american
republics
without
compromising
their
tranquillity
the
ambition
of
power
yields
to
the
less
refined
and
less
dangerous
love
of
comfort
it
is
generally
believed
in
america
that
the
existence
and
the
permanence
of
the
republican
form
of
government
in
the
new
world
depend
upon
the
existence
and
the
permanence
of
the
federal
system
and
it
is
not
unusual
to
attribute
a
large
share
of
the
misfortunes
which
have
befallen
the
new
states
of
south
america
to
the
injudicious
erection
of
great
republics
instead
of
a
divided
and
confederate
sovereignty
it
is
incontestably
true
that
the
love
and
the
habits
of
republican
government
in
the
united
states
were
engendered
in
the
townships
and
in
the
provincial
assemblies
in
a
small
state
like
that
of
connecticut
for
instance
where
cutting
a
canal
or
laying
down
a
road
is
a
momentous
political
question
where
the
state
has
no
army
to
pay
and
no
wars
to
carry
on
and
where
much
wealth
and
much
honor
can
not
be
bestowed
upon
the
chief
citizens
no
form
of
government
can
be
more
natural
or
more
appropriate
than
that
of
a
republic
but
it
is
this
same
republican
spirit
it
is
these
manners
and
customs
of
a
free
people
which
are
engendered
and
nurtured
in
the
different
states
to
be
afterward
applied
to
the
country
at
large
the
public
spirit
of
the
union
is
so
to
speak
nothing
more
than
an
abstract
of
the
patriotic
zeal
of
the
provinces
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
transfuses
his
attachment
to
his
little
republic
into
the
common
store
of
american
patriotism
in
defending
the
union
he
defends
the
increasing
prosperity
of
his
own
district
the
right
of
conducting
its
affairs
and
the
hope
of
causing
measures
of
improvement
to
be
adopted
which
may
be
favorable
to
his
own
interests
and
these
are
motives
which
are
wont
to
stir
men
more
readily
than
the
general
interests
of
the
country
and
the
glory
of
the
nation
on
the
other
hand
if
the
temper
and
the
manners
of
the
inhabitants
especially
fitted
them
to
promote
the
welfare
of
a
great
republic
the
federal
system
smoothed
the
obstacles
which
they
might
have
encountered
the
confederation
of
all
the
american
states
presents
none
of
the
ordinary
disadvantages
resulting
from
great
agglomerations
of
men
the
union
is
a
great
republic
in
extent
but
the
paucity
of
objects
for
which
its
government
provides
assimilates
it
to
a
small
state
its
acts
are
important
but
they
are
rare
as
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
is
limited
and
incomplete
its
exercise
is
not
incompatible
with
liberty
for
it
does
not
excite
those
insatiable
desires
of
fame
and
power
which
have
proved
so
fatal
to
great
republics
as
there
is
no
common
centre
to
the
country
vast
capital
cities
colossal
wealth
abject
poverty
and
sudden
revolutions
are
alike
unknown
and
political
passion
instead
of
spreading
over
the
land
like
a
torrent
of
desolation
spends
its
strength
against
the
interests
and
the
individual
passions
of
every
state
nevertheless
all
commodities
and
ideas
circulate
throughout
the
union
as
freely
as
in
a
country
inhabited
by
one
people
nothing
checks
the
spirit
of
enterprise
the
government
avails
itself
of
the
assistance
of
all
who
have
talents
or
knowledge
to
serve
it
within
the
frontiers
of
the
union
the
profoundest
peace
prevails
as
within
the
heart
of
some
great
empire
abroad
it
ranks
with
the
most
powerful
nations
of
the
earth
two
thousand
miles
of
coast
are
open
to
the
commerce
of
the
world
and
as
it
possesses
the
keys
of
the
globe
its
flag
is
respected
in
the
most
remote
seas
the
union
is
as
happy
and
as
free
as
a
small
people
and
as
glorious
and
as
strong
as
a
great
nation
why
the
federal
system
is
not
adapted
to
all
peoples
and
how
the
were
enabled
to
adopt
it
every
federal
system
contains
defects
which
baffle
the
efforts
of
the
the
federal
system
is
it
demands
a
daily
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
practical
knowledge
of
the
government
common
among
the
relative
weakness
of
the
government
of
the
union
another
defect
inherent
in
the
federal
the
americans
have
diminished
without
remedying
the
sovereignty
of
the
separate
states
apparently
weaker
but
really
stronger
than
that
of
the
natural
causes
of
union
must
exist
between
confederate
peoples
beside
the
what
these
causes
are
among
the
maine
and
georgia
separated
by
a
distance
of
a
thousand
miles
more
naturally
united
than
normandy
and
war
the
main
peril
of
this
proved
even
by
the
example
of
the
united
the
union
has
no
great
wars
to
dangers
to
which
europeans
would
be
exposed
if
they
adopted
the
federal
system
of
the
americans
when
a
legislator
succeeds
after
persevering
efforts
in
exercising
an
indirect
influence
upon
the
destiny
of
nations
his
genius
is
lauded
by
mankind
while
in
point
of
fact
the
geographical
position
of
the
country
which
he
is
unable
to
change
a
social
condition
which
arose
without
his
manners
and
opinions
which
he
can
not
trace
to
their
source
and
an
origin
with
which
he
is
unacquainted
exercise
so
irresistible
an
influence
over
the
courses
of
society
that
he
is
himself
borne
away
by
the
current
after
an
ineffectual
resistance
like
the
navigator
he
may
direct
the
vessel
which
bears
him
along
but
he
can
neither
change
its
structure
nor
raise
the
winds
nor
lull
the
waters
which
swell
beneath
him
i
have
shown
the
advantages
which
the
americans
derive
from
their
federal
system
it
remains
for
me
to
point
out
the
circumstances
which
render
that
system
practicable
as
its
benefits
are
not
to
be
enjoyed
by
all
nations
the
incidental
defects
of
the
federal
system
which
originate
in
the
laws
may
be
corrected
by
the
skill
of
the
legislator
but
there
are
farther
evils
inherent
in
the
system
which
can
not
be
counteracted
by
the
peoples
which
adopt
it
these
nations
must
therefore
find
the
strength
necessary
to
support
the
natural
imperfections
of
the
government
the
most
prominent
evil
of
all
federal
systems
is
the
very
complex
nature
of
the
means
they
employ
two
sovereignties
are
necessarily
in
the
presence
of
each
other
the
legislator
may
simplify
and
equalize
the
action
of
these
two
sovereignties
by
limiting
each
of
them
to
a
sphere
of
authority
accurately
defined
but
he
can
not
combine
them
into
one
or
prevent
them
from
running
into
collision
at
certain
points
the
federal
system
therefore
rests
upon
a
theory
which
is
necessarily
complicated
and
which
demands
the
daily
exercise
of
a
considerable
share
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
those
it
governs
a
proposition
must
be
plain
to
be
adopted
by
the
understanding
of
a
people
a
false
notion
which
is
clear
and
precise
will
always
meet
with
a
greater
number
of
adherents
in
the
world
than
a
true
principle
which
is
obscure
or
involved
hence
it
arises
that
parties
which
are
like
small
communities
in
the
heart
of
the
nation
invariably
adopt
some
principle
or
some
name
as
a
symbol
which
very
inadequately
represents
the
end
they
have
in
view
and
the
means
which
are
at
their
disposal
but
without
which
they
could
neither
act
nor
subsist
the
governments
which
are
founded
upon
a
single
principle
or
a
single
feeling
which
is
easily
defined
are
perhaps
not
the
best
but
they
are
unquestionably
the
strongest
and
the
most
durable
in
the
world
in
examining
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
is
the
most
perfect
federal
constitution
that
ever
existed
one
is
startled
on
the
other
hand
at
the
variety
of
information
and
the
excellence
of
discretion
which
it
presupposes
in
the
people
whom
it
is
meant
to
govern
the
government
of
the
union
depends
entirely
upon
legal
fictions
the
union
is
an
ideal
notion
which
only
exists
in
the
mind
and
whose
limits
and
extent
can
only
be
discerned
by
the
understanding
when
once
the
general
theory
is
comprehended
numerous
difficulties
remain
to
be
solved
in
its
application
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
is
so
involved
in
that
of
the
states
that
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
its
boundaries
at
the
first
glance
the
whole
structure
of
the
government
is
artificial
and
conventional
and
it
would
be
to
a
people
which
has
not
long
been
accustomed
to
conduct
its
own
affairs
or
to
one
in
which
the
science
of
politics
has
not
descended
to
the
humblest
classes
of
society
i
have
never
been
more
struck
by
the
good
sense
and
the
practical
judgment
of
the
americans
than
in
the
ingenious
devices
by
which
they
elude
the
numberless
difficulties
resulting
from
their
federal
constitution
i
scarcely
ever
met
with
a
plain
american
citizen
who
could
not
distinguish
with
surprising
facility
the
obligations
created
by
the
laws
of
congress
from
those
created
by
the
laws
of
his
own
state
and
who
after
having
discriminated
between
the
matters
which
come
under
the
cognizance
of
the
union
and
those
which
the
local
legislature
is
competent
to
regulate
could
not
point
out
the
exact
limit
of
the
several
jurisdictions
of
the
federal
courts
and
the
tribunals
of
the
state
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
like
those
exquisite
productions
of
human
industry
which
ensure
wealth
and
renown
to
their
inventors
but
which
are
profitless
in
any
other
hands
this
truth
is
exemplified
by
the
condition
of
mexico
at
the
present
time
the
mexicans
were
desirous
of
establishing
a
federal
system
and
they
took
the
federal
constitution
of
their
neighbors
the
as
their
model
and
copied
it
with
considerable
accuracy
but
although
they
had
borrowed
the
letter
of
the
law
they
were
unable
to
create
or
to
introduce
the
spirit
and
the
sense
which
gave
it
life
they
were
involved
in
ceaseless
embarrassments
between
the
mechanism
of
their
double
government
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
and
that
of
the
union
perpetually
exceeded
their
respective
privileges
and
entered
into
collision
and
to
the
present
day
mexico
is
alternately
the
victim
of
anarchy
and
the
slave
of
military
despotism
the
second
and
the
most
fatal
of
all
the
defects
i
have
alluded
to
and
that
which
i
believe
to
be
inherent
in
the
federal
system
is
the
relative
weakness
of
the
government
of
the
union
the
principle
upon
which
all
confederations
rest
is
that
of
a
divided
sovereignty
the
legislator
may
render
this
partition
less
perceptible
he
may
even
conceal
it
for
a
time
from
the
public
eye
but
he
can
not
prevent
it
from
existing
and
a
divided
sovereignty
must
always
be
less
powerful
than
an
entire
supremacy
the
reader
has
seen
in
the
remarks
i
have
made
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
the
americans
have
displayed
singular
ingenuity
in
combining
the
restriction
of
the
power
of
the
union
within
the
narrow
limits
of
the
federal
government
with
the
semblance
and
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
force
of
a
national
government
by
this
means
the
legislators
of
the
union
have
succeeded
in
diminishing
though
not
in
counteracting
the
natural
danger
of
confederations
it
has
been
remarked
that
the
american
government
does
not
apply
itself
to
the
states
but
that
it
immediately
transmits
its
injunctions
to
the
citizens
and
compels
them
as
isolated
individuals
to
comply
with
its
demands
but
if
the
federal
law
were
to
clash
with
the
interests
and
prejudices
of
a
state
it
might
be
feared
that
all
the
citizens
of
that
state
would
conceive
themselves
to
be
interested
in
the
cause
of
a
single
individual
who
should
refuse
to
obey
if
all
the
citizens
of
the
state
were
aggrieved
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
manner
by
the
authority
of
the
union
the
federal
government
would
vainly
attempt
to
subdue
them
individually
they
would
instinctively
unite
in
the
common
defence
and
they
would
derive
a
organization
from
the
share
of
sovereignty
which
the
institution
of
their
state
allows
them
to
enjoy
fiction
would
give
way
to
reality
and
an
organized
portion
of
the
territory
might
then
contest
the
central
authority
the
same
observation
holds
good
with
regard
to
the
federal
jurisdiction
if
the
courts
of
the
union
violated
an
important
law
of
a
state
in
a
private
case
the
real
if
not
the
apparent
contest
would
arise
between
the
aggrieved
state
represented
by
a
citizen
and
the
union
represented
by
its
courts
of
justice
he
would
have
but
a
partial
knowledge
of
the
world
who
should
imagine
that
it
is
possible
by
the
aid
of
legal
fictions
to
prevent
men
from
finding
out
and
employing
those
means
of
gratifying
their
passions
which
have
been
left
open
to
them
and
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
american
legislators
when
they
rendered
a
collision
between
the
two
sovereignties
less
probable
destroyed
the
causes
of
such
a
misfortune
but
it
may
even
be
affirmed
that
they
were
unable
to
ensure
the
preponderance
of
the
federal
element
in
a
case
of
this
kind
the
union
is
possessed
of
money
and
of
troops
but
the
affections
and
the
prejudices
of
the
people
are
in
the
bosom
of
the
states
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
is
an
abstract
being
which
is
connected
with
but
few
external
objects
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
is
hourly
perceptible
easily
understood
constantly
active
and
if
the
former
is
of
recent
creation
the
latter
is
coeval
with
the
people
itself
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
is
factitious
that
of
the
states
is
natural
and
derives
its
existence
from
its
own
simple
influence
like
the
authority
of
a
parent
the
supreme
power
of
the
nation
affects
only
a
few
of
the
chief
interests
of
society
it
represents
an
immense
but
remote
country
and
claims
a
feeling
of
patriotism
which
is
vague
and
but
the
authority
of
the
states
controls
every
individual
citizen
at
every
hour
and
in
all
circumstances
it
protects
his
property
his
freedom
and
his
life
and
when
we
recollect
the
traditions
the
customs
the
prejudices
of
local
and
familiar
attachment
with
which
it
is
connected
we
can
not
doubt
the
superiority
of
a
power
which
is
interwoven
with
every
circumstance
that
renders
the
love
of
one
native
country
instinctive
to
the
human
heart
since
legislators
are
unable
to
obviate
such
dangerous
collisions
as
occur
between
the
two
sovereignties
which
in
the
federal
system
their
first
object
must
be
not
only
to
dissuade
the
confederate
states
from
warfare
but
to
encourage
such
institutions
as
may
promote
the
maintenance
of
peace
hence
it
results
that
the
federal
compact
can
not
be
lasting
unless
there
exists
in
the
communities
which
are
leagued
together
a
certain
number
of
inducements
to
union
which
render
their
common
dependance
agreeable
and
the
task
of
the
government
light
and
that
system
can
not
succeed
without
the
presence
of
favorable
circumstances
added
to
the
influence
of
good
laws
all
the
people
which
have
ever
formed
a
confederation
have
been
held
together
by
a
certain
number
of
common
interests
which
served
as
the
intellectual
ties
of
association
but
the
sentiments
and
the
principles
of
man
must
be
taken
into
consideration
as
well
as
his
immediate
interest
a
certain
uniformity
of
civilisation
is
not
less
necessary
to
the
durability
of
a
confederation
than
a
uniformity
of
interests
in
the
states
which
compose
it
in
switzerland
the
difference
which
exists
between
the
canton
of
uri
and
the
canton
of
vaud
is
equal
to
that
between
the
fifteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
and
properly
speaking
switzerland
has
never
possessed
a
federal
government
the
union
between
these
two
cantons
only
subsists
upon
the
map
and
their
discrepancies
would
soon
be
perceived
if
an
attempt
were
made
by
a
central
authority
to
prescribe
the
same
laws
to
the
whole
territory
one
of
the
circumstances
which
most
powerfully
contribute
to
support
the
federal
government
in
america
is
that
the
states
have
not
only
similar
interests
a
common
origin
and
a
common
tongue
but
that
they
are
also
arrived
at
the
same
stage
of
civilisation
which
almost
always
renders
a
union
feasible
i
do
not
know
of
any
european
nation
how
small
soever
it
may
be
which
does
not
present
less
uniformity
in
its
different
provinces
than
the
american
people
which
occupies
a
territory
as
extensive
as
one
half
of
europe
the
distance
from
the
state
of
maine
to
that
of
georgia
is
reckoned
at
about
one
thousand
miles
but
the
difference
between
the
civilisation
of
maine
and
that
of
georgia
is
slighter
than
the
difference
between
the
habits
of
normandy
and
those
of
britany
maine
and
georgia
which
are
placed
at
the
opposite
extremities
of
a
great
empire
are
consequently
in
the
natural
possession
of
more
real
inducements
to
form
a
confederation
than
normandy
and
britany
which
are
only
separated
by
a
bridge
the
geographical
position
of
the
country
contributed
to
increase
the
facilities
which
the
american
legislators
derived
from
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
inhabitants
and
it
is
to
this
circumstance
that
the
adoption
and
the
maintenance
of
the
federal
system
are
mainly
attributable
the
most
important
occurrence
which
can
mark
the
annals
of
a
people
is
the
breaking
out
of
a
war
in
war
a
people
struggle
with
the
energy
of
a
single
man
against
foreign
nations
in
the
defence
of
its
very
existence
the
skill
of
a
government
the
good
sense
of
the
community
and
the
natural
fondness
which
men
entertain
for
their
country
may
suffice
to
maintain
peace
in
the
interior
of
a
district
and
to
favor
its
internal
prosperity
but
a
nation
can
only
carry
on
a
great
war
at
the
cost
of
more
numerous
and
more
painful
sacrifices
and
to
suppose
that
a
great
number
of
men
will
of
their
own
accord
comply
with
the
exigencies
of
the
state
is
to
betray
an
ignorance
of
mankind
all
the
peoples
which
have
been
obliged
to
sustain
a
long
and
serious
warfare
have
consequently
been
led
to
augment
the
power
of
their
government
those
which
have
not
succeeded
in
this
attempt
have
been
subjugated
a
long
war
almost
always
places
nations
in
the
wretched
alternative
of
being
abandoned
to
ruin
by
defeat
or
to
despotism
by
success
war
therefore
renders
the
symptoms
of
the
weakness
of
a
government
most
palpable
and
most
alarming
and
i
have
shown
that
the
inherent
defect
of
federal
governments
is
that
of
being
weak
the
federal
system
is
not
only
deficient
in
every
kind
of
centralized
administration
but
the
central
government
itself
is
imperfectly
organized
which
is
invariably
an
influential
cause
of
inferiority
when
the
nation
is
opposed
to
other
countries
which
are
themselves
governed
by
a
single
authority
in
the
federal
constitution
of
the
united
states
by
which
the
central
government
possesses
more
real
force
this
evil
is
still
extremely
sensible
an
example
will
illustrate
the
case
to
the
reader
the
constitution
confers
upon
congress
the
right
of
calling
forth
militia
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
union
suppress
insurrections
and
repel
invasions
and
another
article
declares
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
the
of
the
militia
in
the
war
of
the
president
ordered
the
militia
of
the
northern
states
to
march
to
the
frontiers
but
connecticut
and
massachusetts
whose
interests
were
impaired
by
the
war
refused
to
obey
the
command
they
argued
that
the
constitution
authorizes
the
federal
government
to
call
forth
the
militia
in
cases
of
insurrection
or
invasion
but
that
in
the
present
instance
there
was
neither
invasion
nor
insurrection
they
added
that
the
same
constitution
which
conferred
upon
the
union
the
right
of
calling
forth
the
militia
reserved
to
the
states
that
of
naming
the
officers
and
that
consequently
as
they
understood
the
clause
no
officer
of
the
union
had
any
right
to
command
the
militia
even
during
war
except
the
president
in
person
and
in
this
case
they
were
ordered
to
join
an
army
commanded
by
another
individual
these
absurd
and
pernicious
doctrines
received
the
sanction
not
only
of
the
governors
and
legislative
bodies
but
also
of
the
courts
of
justice
in
both
states
and
the
federal
government
was
constrained
to
raise
elsewhere
the
troops
which
it
required
the
only
safeguard
which
the
american
union
with
all
the
relative
perfection
of
its
laws
possesses
against
the
dissolution
which
would
be
produced

envy
the

of

can
not
believe

could
maintain
a
long

an
equal
contest
with
a
nation
of
similar
strength
in
which
the

should
be
centralised
a
people
which
should
divide
its
sovereignty
into
fractional
powers
in
the
presence
of

monarchies
of
europe
would
in
my
opinion
by
that
very
act
abdicate
its
power

perhaps
its
existence
and
its
name
but
such
is
the
admirable
position
of
the

that
man
has
no

himself

that

here
a
most
important
question
of
a
constitutional
nature
arose
which
was
whether
the
jurisdiction
given
by

in
cases
in
which
a
state
is
a
party
extended
to
suits
brought

entirely
taken

as

regards
suits
brought
against

state
see
story
commentaries
or
in

large
edition
as
for
instance
all
cases
of

this
principle
was
in
some
measure
restricted
by
the
introduction
of
the
several
states
as
independent
powers
into
the
senate
and
by
allowing
them
to
vote
separately
in
the
house
of
representatives
when
the
president
is
elected

these
are
exceptions
and
the
contrary
principle
is
the
rule
it
is
perfectly
clear
says
story

in

that
any
law
which
enlarges
abridges
or
in
any
manner
changes
the
intention
of
the
parties
resulting
from
the
stipulations
in
the
contract
necessarily
impairs
it
he
gives
in
the
same
place
a
very
long
and
careful
definition
of
what
is
understood
by
a
contract
in
federal
jurisprudence
a
grant
made
by
the
state
to
a
private
individual
and
accepted
by
him
is
a
contract
and
can
not
be
revoked
by
any
future
law
a
charter
granted
by
the
state
to
a
company
is
a
contract
and
equally
binding
to
the
state
as
to
the
grantee
the
clause
of
the
constitution
here
referred
to
ensures
therefore
the
existence
of
a
great
part
of
acquired
rights
but
not
of
all
property
may
legally
be
held
though
it
may
not
have
passed
into
the
hands
by
means
of
a
contract
and
its
possession
is
an
acquired
right
not
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
is
given
by
story

in

in

hampshire

been
founded
by
a
charter
granted
to
certain
individuals
before

trustees
formed

corporation
under

the
legislature
of

had
without
the
consent
of
this
corporation
passed
an
act
changing
the
organization
of
the
original
provincial
charter
of
the
college
and
transferring
all
the
rights
privileges
and
franchises
from
the
old
charter
trustees
to
new
trustees
appointed
under
the
act
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
was
contested
and
after
solemn
arguments
it
was
deliberately
held
by
the
supreme
court
that
the
provincial
charter
was
a
contract
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
art
i
sect
and
that
the
amendatory
act
was
utterly
void
as
impairing
the
obligation
of
that
charter
the
college
was
deemed
like
other
colleges
of
private
foundation
to
be
a
private
eleemosynary
institution
endowed
by
its
charter
with
a
capacity
to
take
property
unconnected
with
the
government
its
funds
were
bestowed
upon
the
faith
of
the
charter
and
those
funds
consisted
entirely
of
private
donations
it
is
true
that
the
uses
were
in
some
sense
public
that
is
for
the
general
benefit
and
not
for
the
mere
benefit
of
the
corporators
but
this
did
not
make
the
corporation
a
public
corporation
it
was
a
private
institution
for
general
charity
it
was
not
distinguishable
in
principle
from
a
private
donation
vested
in
private
trustees
for
a
public
charity
or
for
a
particular
purpose
of
beneficence
and
the
state

pliancy

current

its
best
recommendation

such
men
entertain
very
crude
notions
as
well
of
the
purpose
for
which
government
was
instituted
as
of
the
true
means
by
which
the
public
happiness
may
be
promoted
the
republican
principle
demands
that
the
deliberative
sense
of
the
community
should
govern
the
conduct
of
those
to
whom
they
intrust
the
managements
of
their
affairs
but
it
does
not
require
an
unqualified
complaisance
to
every
sudden
breeze
of
passion
or
to
every
transient
impulse
which
the
people
may
receive
from
the
arts
of
men
who
flatter
their
prejudices
to
betray
their
interests
it
is
a
just
observation
that
the
people
commonly
the
this
often
applies
to
their
very
errors
but
their
good
sense
would
despise
the
adulator
who
should
pretend
that
they
would
always
about
the
of
promoting
it
they
know
from
experience
that
they
sometimes
err
and
the
wonder
is
that
they
so
seldom
err
as
they
do
beset
as
they
continually

the
wiles

parasites

sycophants

the
people
are
at
variance
with
their
inclinations
it
is
the
duty
of
persons
whom
they
have
appointed
to
be
the
guardians
of
those
interests
to
withstand
the
temporary
delusion
in
order
to
give
them
time
and
opportunity
for
more
cool
and
sedate
reflection
instances
might
be
cited
in
which
a
conduct
of
this
kind
has
saved
the
people
from
very
fatal
consequences
of
their
own
mistakes
and
has
procured
lasting
monuments
of
their
gratitude
to
the
men
who
had
courage
and
magnanimity
enough
to
serve
at
the
peril
of
their
displeasure
this
was
the
case
in
greece
when
philip
undertook
to
execute
the
decree
of
the
amphictyons
in
the
low
countries
where
the
province
of
holland
always
gave
the
law
and
in
our
time
in
the
germanic
confederation
in
which
austria
and
prussia
assume
a
great
degree
of
influence
over
the
whole
country
in
the
name
of
the
diet
such
has
always
been
the
situation
of
the
swiss
confederation
which
would
have
perished
ages
ago
but
for
the
mutual
jealousies
of
its
neighbors
i
do
not
speak
of
a
confederation
of
small
republics
but
of
a
great
consolidated
republic
see
the
mexican
constitution
of
for
instance
the
union
possesses
by
the
constitution
the
right
of
selling
unoccupied
lands
for
its
own
profit
supposing
that
the
state
of
ohio
should
claim
the
same
right
in
behalf
of
certain
territories
lying
within
its
boundaries
upon
the
plea
that
the
constitution
refers
to
those
lands
alone
which
do
not
belong
to
the
jurisdiction
of
any
particular
state
and
consequently
should
choose
to
dispose
of
them
itself
the
litigation
would
be
carried
on
in
the
name
of
the
purchasers
from
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
purchasers
from
the
union
and
not
in
the
names
of
ohio
and
the
union
but
what
would
become
of
this
legal
fiction
if
the
federal
purchaser
was
confirmed
in
his
right
by
the
courts
of
the
union
while
the
other
competitor
was
ordered
to
retain
possession
by
the
tribunals
of
the
state
of
ohio
the
difficulty
supposed
by
the
author
in
this
note
is
imaginary
the
question
of
title
to
the
lands
in
the
case
put
must
depend
upon
the
constitution
treaties
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
a
decision
in
the
state
court
adverse
to
the
claim
or
title
set
up
under
those
laws
must
by
the
very
words
of
the
constitution
and
of
the
judiciary
act
be
subject
to
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
whose
decision
is
final
the
remarks
in
the
text
of
this
page
upon
the
relative
weakness
of
the
government
of
the
union
are
equally
applicable
to
any
form
of
republican
or
democratic
government
and
are
not
peculiar
to
a
federal
system
under
the
circumstances
supposed
by
the
author
of
all
the
citizens
of
a
state
or
a
large
majority
of
them
aggrieved
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
manner
by
the
operation
of
any
law
the
same
difficulty
would
arise
in
executing
the
laws
of
the
state
as
those
of
the
union
indeed
such
instances
of
the
total
inefficacy
of
state
laws
are
not
wanting
the
fact
is
that
all
republics
depend
on
the
willingness
of
the
people
to
execute
the
laws
if
they
will
not
enforce
them
there
is
so
far
an
end
to
the
government
for
it
possesses
no
power
adequate
to
the
control
of
the
physical
power
of
the
people
not
only
in
theory
but
in
fact
a
republican
government
must
be
administered
by
the
people
themselves
they
and
they
alone
must
execute
the
laws
and
hence
the
first
principles
in
such
governments
that
on
which
all
others
depend
and
without
which
no
other
can
exist
is
and
must
be
obedience
to
the
existing
laws
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
it
is
the
vital
condition
of
the
social
compact
he
who
claims
a
dispensing
power
for
himself
by
which
he
suspends
the
operation
of
the
law
in
his
own
case
is
worse
than
a
usurper
for
he
not
only
tramples
under
foot
the
constitution
of
his
country
but
violates
the
reciprocal
pledge
which
he
has
given
to
his
and
has
received
from
them
that
he
will
abide
by
the
laws
constitutionally
enacted
upon
the
strength
of
which
pledge
his
own
personal
rights
and
acquisitions
are
protected
by
the
rest
of
the

commentaries
vol
i
have
selected
an
example
which
relates
to
a
time
posterior
to
the
promulgation
of
the
present
constitution
if
i
had
gone
back
to
the
days
of
the
confederation
i
might
have
given
still
more
striking
instances
the
whole
nation
was
at
that
time
in
a
state
of
enthusiastic
excitement
the
revolution
was
represented
by
a
man
who
was
the
idol
of
the
people
but
at
that
very
period
congress
had
to
say
the
truth
no
resources
at
all
at
its
disposal
troops
and
supplies
were
perpetually
wanting
the
best
devised
projects
failed
in
the
execution
and
the
union
which
was
constantly
on
the
verge
of
destruction
was
saved
by
the
weakness
of
its
enemies
far
more
than
by
its
own
strength

i

and
i
have
depicted
the
present
characteristics
of

in

but
a

exists
above
these

and
beyond
these
characteristic
features
which
may
destroy
or
modify
them
at

pleasure
i

that
of

it
remains
to
be
shown
in
what
manner
this
power
which
regulates
the

acts
its
propensities
and
its
passions
remain
to
be
pointed
out
as
well
as
the
secret
springs
which
retard
accelerate
or
direct
its
irresistible
course
and
the
effects
of
its
unbounded
authority
with
the
destiny
which
is
probably
reserved

it
in
america
the
people
appoints
the
legislative
and
the
executive
power
and
furnishes
the
jurors
who
punish
all
offences
against
the
laws
the
american
institutions
are
democratic
not
only
in
their
principle
but
in
all
their
consequences
and
the
people
elects
its
representatives
and
for
the
most
part
in
order
to
ensure
their
dependence
the
people
is
therefore
the
real
directing
power
and
although
the
form
of
government
is
representative
it
is
evident
that
the
opinions
the
prejudices
the
interests
and
even
the
passions
of
the
community
are
hindered
by
no
durable
obstacles
from
exercising
a
perpetual
influence
on
society
in
the

the
majority
governs
in
the
name
of
the
people
as
is
the
case
in
all
the
countries
in
which
the
people
is
supreme
this
majority
is
principally
composed
of
peaceable
citizens
who
either
by
inclination
or
by
interest
are
sincerely
desirous
of
the
welfare
of
their
country
but
they
are
surrounded
by
the
incessant
agitation
of
parties

attempt
to
gain

to

is
done
with
this
aristocratic
and
democratic
character
to
be
met
with
in
all
struggle
of
general
jackson
against
the
bank
a
great
division
must
be
made
between
parties
some
countries
are
so
large
that
the
different
populations
which
inhabit
them
have
contradictory
interests
although
they
are
the
subjects
of
the
same
government
and
they
may
thence
be
in
a
perpetual
state
of
opposition
in
this
case
the
different
fractions
of
the
people
may
more
properly
be
considered
as
distinct
nations
than
as
mere
parties
and
if
a
civil
war
breaks
out
the
struggle
is
carried
off
by
rival
peoples
rather
than
by
factions
in
the
state
but
when
the
citizens
entertain
different
opinions
upon
subjects
which
affect
the
whole
country
alike
such
for
instance
as
the
principles
upon
which
the
government
is
to
be
conducted
then
distinctions
arise
which
may
correctly
be
styled
parties
parties
are
a
necessary
evil
in
free
governments
but
they
have
not
at
all
times
the
same
character
and
the
same
propensities
at
certain
periods
a
nation
may
be
oppressed
by
such
insupportable
evils
as
to
conceive
the
design
of
effecting
a
total
change
in
its
political
constitution
at
other
times
the
mischief
lies
still
deeper
and
the
existence
of
society
itself
is
endangered
such
are
the
times
of
great
revolutions
and
of
great
parties
but
between
these
epochs
of
misery
and
of
confusion
there
are
periods
during
which
human
society
seems
to
rest
and
mankind
to
make
a
pause
this
pause
is
indeed
only
apparent
for
time
does
not
stop
its
course
for
nations
any
more
than
for
men
they
are
all
advancing
toward
a
goal
with
which
they
are
unacquainted
and
we
only
imagine
them
to
be
stationary
when
their
progress
escapes
our
observation
as
men
who
are
going
at
a
foot
pace
seem
to
be
standing
still
to
those
who
run
but
however
this
may
be
there
are
certain
epochs
at
which
the
changes
that
take
place
in
the
social
and
political
constitution
of
nations
are
so
slow
and
so
insensible
that
men
imagine
their
present
condition
to
be
a
final
state
and
the
human
mind
believing
itself
to
be
firmly
based
upon
certain
foundations
does
not
extend
its
researches
beyond
the
horizon
which
it
descries
these
are
the
times
of
small
parties
and
of
intrigue
the
political
parties
which
i
style
great
are
those
which
cling
to
principles
more
than
to
consequences
to
general
and
not
to
especial
cases
to
ideas
and
not
to
men
these
parties
are
usually
distinguished
by
a
nobler
character
by
more
generous
passions
more
genuine
convictions
and
a
more
bold
and
open
conduct
than
the
others
in
them
private
interest
which
always
plays
the
chief
part
in
political
passions
is
more
studiously
veiled
under
the
pretext
of
the
public
good
and
it
may
even
be
sometimes
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
the
very
person
whom
it
excites
and
impels
minor
parties
are
on
the
other
hand
generally
deficient
in
political
faith
as
they
are
not
sustained
or
dignified
by
a
lofty
purpose
they
ostensibly
display
the
egotism
of
their
character
in
their
actions
they
glow
with
a
factitious
zeal
their
language
is
vehement
but
their
conduct
is
timid
and
irresolute
the
means
they
employ
are
as
wretched
as
the
end
at
which
they
aim
hence
it
arises
that
when
a
calm
state
of
things
succeeds
a
violent
revolution
the
leaders
of
society
seem
suddenly
to
disappear
and
the
powers
of
the
human
mind
to
lie
concealed
society
is
convulsed
by
great
parties
by
minor
ones
it
is
agitated
it
is
torn
by
the
former
by
the
latter
it
is
degraded
and
if
these
sometimes
save
it
by
a
salutary
perturbation
those
invariably
disturb
it
to
no
good
end
america
has
already
lost
the
great
parties
which
once
divided
the
nation
and
if
her
happiness
is
considerably
increased
her
morality
has
suffered
by
their
extinction
when
the
war
of
independence
was
terminated
and
the
foundations
of
the
new
government
were
to
be
laid
down
the
nation
was
divided
between
two
opinions
two
opinions
which
are
as
old
as
the
world
and
which
are
perpetually
to
be
met
with
under
all
the
forms
and
all
the
names
which
have
ever
obtained
in
free
communities
the
one
tending
to
limit
the
other
to
extend
indefinitely
the
power
of
the
people
the
conflict
of
these
two
opinions
never
assumed
that
degree
of
violence
in
america
which
it
has
frequently
displayed
elsewhere
both
parties
of
the
americans
were
in
fact
agreed
upon
the
most
essential
points
and
neither
of
them
had
to
destroy
a
traditionary
constitution
or
to
overthrow
the
structure
of
society
in
order
to
insure
its
own
triumph
in
neither
of
them
consequently
were
a
great
number
of
private
interests
affected
by
success
or
by
defeat
but
moral
principles
of
a
high
order
such
as
the
love
of
equality
and
of
independence
were
concerned
in
the
struggle
and
they
sufficed
to
kindle
violent
passions
the
party
which
desired
to
limit
the
power
of
the
people
endeavored
to
apply
its
doctrines
more
especially
to
the
constitution
of
the
union
whence
it
derived
its
name
of
the
other
party
which
affected
to
be
more
exclusively
attached
to
the
cause
of
liberty
took
that
of
america
is
the
land
of
democracy
and
the
federalists
were
always
in
a
minority
but
they
reckoned
on
their
side
almost
all
the
great
men
who
had
been
called
forth
by
the
war
of
independence
and
their
moral
influence
was
very
considerable
their
cause
was
moreover
favored
by
circumstances
the
ruin
of
the
confederation
had
impressed
the
people
with
a
dread
of
anarchy
and
the
federalists
did
not
fail
to
profit
by
this
transient
disposition
of
the
multitude
for
ten
or
twelve
years
they
were
at
the
head
of
affairs
and
they
were
able
to
apply
some
though
not
all
of
their
principles
for
the
hostile
current
was
becoming
from
day
to
day
too
violent
to
be
checked
or
stemmed
in
the
republicans
got
possession
of
the
government
thomas
jefferson
was
named
president
and
he
increased
the
influence
of
their
party
by
the
weight
of
his
celebrity
the
greatness
of
his
talents
and
the
immense
extent
of
his
popularity
the
means
by
which
the
federalists
had
maintained
their
position
were
artificial
and
their
resources
were
temporary
it
was
by
the
virtues
or
the
talents
of
their
leaders
that
they
had
risen
to
power
when
the
republicans
attained
to
that
lofty
station
their
opponents
were
overwhelmed
by
utter
defeat
an
immense
majority
declared
itself
against
the
retiring
party
and
the
federalists
found
themselves
in
so
small
a
minority
that
they
at
once
despaired
of
their
future
success
from
that
moment
the
republican
or
democratic
party
has
proceeded
from
conquest
to
conquest
until
it
has
acquired
absolute
supremacy
in
the
country
the
federalists
perceiving
that
they
were
vanquished
without
resource
and
isolated
in
the
midst
of
the
nation
fell
into
two
divisions
of
which
one
joined
the
victorious
republicans
and
the
other
abandoned
its
rallying
point
and
its
name
many
years
have
already
elapsed
since
they
ceased
to
exist
as
a
party
the
accession
of
the
federalists
to
power
was
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
most
fortunate
incidents
which
accompanied
the
formation
of
the
great
american
union
they
resisted
the
inevitable
propensities
of
their
age
and
of
their
country
but
whether
their
theories
were
good
or
bad
they
had
the
defect
of
being
inapplicable
as
a
system
to
the
society
which
they
professed
to
govern
and
that
which
occurred
under
the
auspices
of
jefferson
must
therefore
have
taken
place
sooner
or
later
but
their
government
gave
the
new
republic
time
to
acquire
a
certain
stability
and
afterward
to
support
the
rapid
growth
of
the
very
doctrines
which
they
had
combated
a
considerable
number
of
their
principles
were
in
point
of
fact
embodied
in
the
political
creed
of
their
opponents
and
the
federal
constitution
which
subsists
at
the
present
day
is
a
lasting
monument
of
their
patriotism
and
their
wisdom
great
political
parties
are
not
then
to
be
met
with
in
the
united
states
at
the
present
time
parties
indeed
may
be
found
which
threaten
the
future
tranquillity
of
the
union
but
there
are
none
which
seem
to
contest
the
present
form
of
government
or
the
present
course
of
society
the
parties
by
which
the
union
is
menaced
do
not
rest
upon
abstract
principles
but
upon
temporal
interests
these
interests
disseminated
in
the
provinces
of
so
vast
an
empire
may
be
said
to
constitute
rival
nations
rather
than
parties
thus
upon
a
recent
occasion
the
north
contended
for
the
system
of
commercial
prohibition
and
the
south
took
up
arms
in
favor
of
free
trade
simply
because
the
north
is
a
manufacturing
and
the
south
an
agricultural
district
and
that
the
restrictive
system
which
was
profitable
to
the
one
was
prejudicial
to
the
other
in
the
absence
of
great
parties
the
united
states
abound
with
lesser
controversies
and
public
opinion
is
divided
into
a
thousand
minute
shades
of
difference
upon
questions
of
very
little
moment
the
pains
which
are
taken
to
create
parties
are
inconceivable
and
at
the
present
day
it
is
no
easy
task
in
the
united
states
there
is
no
religious
animosity
because
all
religion
is
respected
and
no
sect
is
predominant
there
is
no
jealousy
of
rank
because
the
people
is
everything
and
none
can
contest
its
authority
lastly
there
is
no
public
misery
to
serve
as
a
means
of
agitation
because
the
physical
position
of
the
country
opens
so
wide
a
field
to
industry
that
man
is
able
to
accomplish
the
most
surprising
undertakings
with
his
own
native
resources
nevertheless
ambitious
men
are
interested
in
the
creation
of
parties
since
it
is
difficult
to
eject
a
person
from
authority
upon
the
mere
ground
that
his
place
is
coveted
by
others
the
skill
of
the
actors
in
the
political
world
lies
therefore
in
the
art
of
creating
parties
a
political
aspirant
in
the
united
states
begins
by
discriminating
his
own
interest
and
by
calculating
upon
those
interests
which
may
be
collected
around
and
amalgamated
with
it
he
then
contrives
to
discover
some
doctrine
or
some
principle
which
may
suit
the
purposes
of
this
new
association
and
which
he
adopts
in
order
to
bring
forward
his
party
and
to
secure
its
popularity
just
as
the
of
a
king
was
in
former
days
incorporated
with
the
volume
which
it
authorized
but
to
which
it
nowise
belonged
when
these
preliminaries
are
terminated
the
new
party
is
ushered
into
the
political
world
all
the
domestic
controversies
of
the
americans
at
first
appear
to
a
stranger
to
be
so
incomprehensible
and
so
puerile
that
he
is
at
a
loss
whether
to
pity
a
people
which
takes
such
arrant
trifles
in
good
earnest
or
to
envy
that
happiness
which
enables
it
to
discuss
them
but
when
he
comes
to
study
the
secret
propensities
which
govern
the
factions
of
america
he
easily
perceives
that
the
greater
part
of
them
are
more
or
less
connected
with
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
divisions
which
have
always
existed
in
free
communities
the
deeper
we
penetrate
into
the
workings
of
these
parties
the
more
do
we
perceive
that
the
object
of
the
one
is
to
limit
and
that
of
the
other
to
extend
the
popular
authority
i
do
not
assert
that
the
ostensible
end
or
even
that
the
secret
aim
of
american
parties
is
to
promote
the
rule
of
aristocracy
or
democracy
in
the
country
but
i
affirm
that
aristocratic
or
democratic
passions
may
easily
be
detected
at
the
bottom
of
all
parties
and
that
although
they
escape
a
superficial
observation
they
are
the
main
point
and
the
very
soul
of
every
faction
in
the
united
states
to
quote
a
recent
example
when
the
president
attacked
the
bank
the
country
was
excited
and
parties
were
formed
the
classes
rallied
round
the
bank
the
common
people
round
the
president
but
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
the
people
had
formed
a
rational
opinion
upon
a
question
which
offers
so
many
difficulties
to
the
most
experienced
statesmen
the
bank
is
a
great
establishment
which
enjoys
an
independent
existence
and
the
people
accustomed
to
make
and
unmake
whatsoever
it
pleases
is
startled
to
meet
with
this
obstacle
to
its
authority
in
the
midst
of
the
perpetual
fluctuation
of
society
the
community
is
irritated
by
so
permanent
an
institution
and
is
led
to
attack
it
in
order
to
see
whether
it
can
be
shaken
and
controlled
like
all
the
other
institutions
of
the
country
remains
of
the
aristocratic
party
in
the
united
states
secret
opposition
of
wealthy
individuals
to
their
their
tastes
for
exclusive
pleasures
and
for
luxury
at
their
simplicity
their
affected
condescension
toward
the
people
it
sometimes
happens
in
a
people
among
which
various
opinions
prevail
that
the
balance
of
the
several
parties
is
lost
and
one
of
them
obtains
an
irresistible
preponderance
overpowers
all
obstacles
harasses
its
opponents
and
appropriates
all
the
resources
of
society
to
its
own
purposes
the
vanquished
citizens
despair
of
success
and
they
conceal
their
dissatisfaction
in
silence
and
in
a
general
apathy
the
nation
seems
to
be
governed
by
a
single
principle
and
the
prevailing
party
assumes
the
credit
of
having
restored
peace
and
unanimity
to
the
country
but
this
apparent
unanimity
is
merely
a
cloak
to
alarming
dissensions
and
perpetual
opposition
this
is
precisely
what
occurred
in
america
when
the
democratic
party
got
the
upper
hand
it
took
exclusive
possession
of
the
conduct
of
affairs
and
from
that
time
the
laws
and
customs
of
society
have
been
adapted
to
its
caprices
at
the
present
day
the
more
affluent
classes
of
society
are
so
entirely
removed
from
the
direction
of
political
affairs
in
the
united
states
that
wealth
far
from
conferring
a
right
to
the
exercise
of
power
is
rather
an
obstacle
than
a
means
of
attaining
to
it
the
wealthy
members
of
the
community
abandon
the
lists
through
unwillingness
to
contend
and
frequently
to
contend
in
vain
against
the
poorest
classes
of
their
they
concentrate
all
their
enjoyments
in
the
privacy
of
their
homes
where
they
occupy
a
rank
which
can
not
be
assumed
in
public
and
they
constitute
a
private
society
in
the
state
which
has
its
own
tastes
and
its
own
pleasures
they
submit
to
this
state
of
things
as
an
irremediable
evil
but
they
are
careful
not
to
show
that
they
are
galled
by
its
continuance
it
is
even
not
uncommon
to
hear
them
laud
the
delights
of
a
republican
government
and
the
advantages
of
democratic
institutions
when
they
are
in
public
next
to
hating
their
enemies
men
are
most
inclined
to
flatter
them
mark
for
instance
that
opulent
citizen
who
is
as
anxious
as
a
jew
of
the
middle
ages
to
conceal
his
wealth
his
dress
is
plain
his
demeanor
unassuming
but
the
interior
of
his
dwelling
glitters
with
luxury
and
none
but
a
few
chosen
guests
whom
he
haughtily
styles
his
equals
are
allowed
to
penetrate
into
this
sanctuary
no
european
noble
is
more
exclusive
in
his
pleasures
or
more
jealous
of
the
smallest
advantages
which
his
privileged
station
confers
upon
him
but
the
very
same
individual
crosses
the
city
to
reach
a
dark
in
the
centre
of
traffic
where
every
one
may
accost
him
who
pleases
if
he
meets
his
cobbler
upon
the
way
they
stop
and
converse
the
two
citizens
discuss
the
affairs
of
the
state
in
which
they
have
an
equal
interest
and
they
shake
hands
before
they
part
but
beneath
this
artificial
enthusiasm
and
these
obsequious
attentions
to
the
preponderating
power
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
the
wealthy
members
of
the
community
entertain
a
hearty
distaste
to
the
democratic
institutions
of
their
country
the
populace
is
at
once
the
object
of
their
scorn
and
of
their
fears
if
the
of
the
democracy
ever
brings
about
a
revolutionary
crisis
and
if
monarchical
institutions
ever
become
practicable
in
the
united
states
the
truth
of
what
i
advance
will
become
obvious
the
two
chief
weapons
which
parties
use
in
order
to
ensure
success
are
the
and
the
formation
of
chapter
xi
liberty
of
the
press
in
the
united
states
difficulty
of
restraining
the
liberty
of
the
particular
reasons
which
some
nations
have
to
cherish
this
the
liberty
of
the
press
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
as
it
is
understood
in
violent
language
of
the
periodical
press
in
the
united
propensities
of
the
periodical
illustrated
by
the
united
opinion
of
the
americans
upon
the
repression
of
the
abuse
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
by
judicial
reasons
for
which
the
press
is
less
powerful
in
america
than
in
france
the
influence
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
does
not
affect
political
opinions
alone
but
it
extends
to
all
the
opinions
of
men
and
it
modifies
customs
as
well
as
laws
in
another
part
of
this
work
i
shall
attempt
to
determine
the
degree
of
influence
which
the
liberty
of
the
press
has
exercised
upon
civil
society
in
the
united
states
and
to
point
out
the
direction
which
it
has
given
to
the
ideas
as
well
as
the
tone
which
it
has
imparted
to
the
character
and
the
feelings
of
the
but
at
present
i
purpose
simply
to
examine
the
effects
produced
by
the
liberty
of
the
press
in
the
political
world
i
confess
that
i
do
not
entertain
that
firm
and
complete
attachment
to
the
liberty
of
the
press
which
things
that
are
supremely
good
in
their
very
nature
are
wont
to
excite
in
the
mind
and
i
approve
of
it
more
from
a
recollection
of
the
evils
it
prevents
than
from
a
consideration
of
the
advantages
it
ensures
if
any
one
can
point
out
an
intermediate
and
yet
a
tenable
position
between
the
complete
independence
and
the
entire
subjection
of
the
public
expression
of
opinion
i
should
perhaps
be
inclined
to
adopt
it
but
the
difficulty
is
to
discover
this
position
if
it
is
your
intention
to
correct
the
abuses
of
unlicensed
printing
and
to
restore
the
use
of
orderly
language
you
may
in
the
first
instance
try
the
offender
by
a
jury
but
if
the
jury
acquits
him
the
opinion
which
was
that
of
a
single
individual
becomes
the
opinion
of
the
country
at
large
too
much
and
too
little
has
therefore
hitherto
been
done
if
you
proceed
you
must
bring
the
delinquent
before
permanent
magistrates
but
even
here
the
cause
must
be
heard
before
it
can
be
decided
and
the
very
principles
which
no
book
would
have
ventured
to
avow
are
blazoned
forth
in
the
pleadings
and
what
was
obscurely
hinted
at
in
a
single
composition
is
then
repeated
in
a
multitude
of
other
publications
the
language
in
which
a
thought
is
embodied
is
the
mere
carcase
of
the
thought
and
not
the
idea
itself
tribunals
may
condemn
the
form
but
the
sense
and
spirit
of
the
work
is
too
subtle
for
their
authority
too
much
has
still
been
done
to
recede
too
little
to
attain
your
end
you
must
therefore
proceed
if
you
establish
a
censorship
of
the
press
the
tongue
of
the
public
speaker
will
still
make
itself
heard
and
you
have
only
increased
the
mischief
the
powers
of
thought
do
not
rely
like
the
powers
of
physical
strength
upon
the
number
of
their
mechanical
agents
nor
can
a
host
of
authors
be
reckoned
like
the
troops
which
compose
an
army
on
the
contrary
the
authority
of
a
principle
is
often
increased
by
the
smallness
of
the
number
of
men
by
whom
it
is
expressed
the
words
of
a
man
which
penetrate
amid
the
passions
of
a
listening
assembly
have
more
weight
than
the
vociferations
of
a
thousand
orators
and
if
it
be
allowed
to
speak
freely
in
any
public
place
the
consequence
is
the
same
as
if
free
speaking
was
allowed
in
every
village
the
liberty
of
discourse
must
therefore
be
destroyed
as
well
as
the
liberty
of
the
press
this
is
the
necessary
term
of
your
efforts
but
if
your
object
was
to
repress
the
abuses
of
liberty
they
have
brought
you
to
the
feet
of
a
despot
you
have
been
led
from
the
extreme
of
independence
to
the
extreme
of
subjection
without
meeting
with
a
single
tenable
position
for
shelter
or
repose
there
are
certain
nations
which
have
peculiar
reasons
for
cherishing
the
press
independently
of
the
general
motives
which
i
have
just
pointed
out
for
in
certain
countries
which
profess
to
enjoy
the
privileges
of
freedom
every
individual
agent
of
the
government
may
violate
the
laws
with
impunity
since
those
whom
he
oppresses
can
not
prosecute
him
before
the
courts
of
justice
in
this
case
the
liberty
of
the
press
is
not
merely
a
guarantee
but
it
is
the
only
guarantee
of
their
liberty
and
their
security
which
the
citizens
possess
if
the
rulers
of
these
nations
proposed
to
abolish
the
independence
of
the
press
the
people
would
be
justified
in
saying
give
us
the
right
of
prosecuting
your
offences
before
the
ordinary
tribunals
and
perhaps
we
may
then
waive
our
right
of
appeal
to
the
tribunal
of
public
opinion
but
in
the
countries
in
which
the
doctrine
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
ostensibly
prevails
the
censorship
of
the
press
is
not
only
dangerous
but
it
is
absurd
when
the
right
of
every
citizen
to
in
the
government
of
society
is
acknowledged
every
citizen
must
be
presumed
to
possess
the
power
of
discriminating
between
the
different
opinions
of
his
contemporaries
and
of
appreciating
the
different
facts
from
which
inferences
may
be
drawn
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
the
liberty
of
the
press
may
therefore
be
looked
upon
as
correlative
institutions
just
as
the
censorship
of
the
press
and
universal
suffrage
are
two
things
which
are
irreconcileably
opposed
and
which
can
not
long
be
retained
among
the
institutions
of
the
same
people
not
a
single
individual
of
the
twelve
millions
who
inhabit
the
territory
of
the
united
states
has
as
yet
dared
to
propose
any
restrictions
to
the
liberty
of
the
press
the
first
newspaper
over
which
i
cast
my
eyes
after
my
arrival
in
america
contained
the
following
article
in
all
this
affair
the
language
of
jackson
has
been
that
of
a
heartless
despot
solely
occupied
with
the
preservation
of
his
own
authority
ambition
is
his
crime
and
it
will
be
his
punishment
too
intrigue
is
his
native
element
and
intrigue
will
confound
his
tricks
and
will
deprive
him
of
his
power
he
governs
by
means
of
corruption
and
his
immoral
practices
will
redound
to
his
shame
and
confusion
his
conduct
in
the
political
arena
has
been
that
of
a
shameless
and
lawless
gamester
he
succeeded
at
the
time
but
the
hour
of
retribution
approaches
and
he
will
be
obliged
to
disgorge
his
winnings
to
throw
aside
his
false
dice
and
to
end
his
days
in
some
retirement
where
he
may
curse
his
madness
at
his
leisure
for
repentance
is
a
virtue
with
which
his
heart
is
likely
to
remain
for
ever
unacquainted
it
is
not
uncommonly
imagined
in
france
that
the
virulence
of
the
press
originates
in
the
uncertain
social
condition
in
the
political
excitement
and
the
general
sense
of
consequent
evil
which
prevail
in
that
country
and
it
is
therefore
supposed
that
as
soon
as
society
has
resumed
a
certain
degree
of
composure
the
press
will
abandon
its
present
vehemence
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
above
causes
explain
the
reason
of
the
extraordinary
ascendency
it
has
acquired
over
the
nation
but
that
they
do
not
exercise
much
influence
upon
the
tone
of
its
language
the
periodical
press
appears
to
me
to
be
actuated
by
passions
and
propensities
independent
of
the
circumstances
in
which
it
is
placed
and
the
present
position
of
america
corroborates
this
opinion
america
is
perhaps
at
this
moment
the
country
of
the
whole
world
which
contains
the
fewest
germs
of
revolution
but
the
press
is
not
less
destructive
in
its
principles
than
in
france
and
it
displays
the
same
violence
without
the
same
reasons
for
indignation
in
america
as
in
france
it
constitutes
a
singular
power
so
strangely
composed
of
mingled
good
and
evil
that
it
is
at
the
same
time
indispensable
to
the
existence
of
freedom
and
nearly
incompatible
with
the
maintenance
of
public
order
its
power
is
certainly
much
greater
in
france
than
in
the
united
states
though
nothing
is
more
rare
in
the
latter
country
than
to
hear
of
a
prosecution
having
been
instituted
against
it
the
reason
of
this
is
perfectly
simple
the
americans
having
once
admitted
the
doctrine
of
sovereignty
of
the
people
apply
it
with
perfect
consistency
it
was
never
their
intention
to
found
a
permanent
state
of
things
with
elements
which
undergo
daily
modifications
and
there
is
consequently
nothing
criminal
in
an
attack
upon
the
existing
laws
provided
it
be
not
attended
with
a
violent
infraction
of
them
they
are
moreover
of
opinion
that
courts
of
justice
are
unable
to
check
the
abuses
of
the
press
and
that
as
the
subtlety
of
human
language
perpetually
eludes
the
severity
of
judicial
analysis
offences
of
this
nature
are
apt
to
escape
the
hand
which
attempts
to
apprehend
them
they
hold
that
to
act
with
efficacy
upon
the
press
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
a
tribunal
not
only
devoted
to
the
existing
order
of
things
but
capable
of
surmounting
the
influence
of
public
opinion
a
tribunal
which
should
conduct
its
proceedings
without
publicity
which
should
pronounce
its
decrees
without
assigning
its
motives
and
punish
the
intentions
even
more
than
the
language
of
an
author
whosoever
should
have
the
power
of
creating
and
maintaining
a
tribunal
of
this
kind
would
waste
his
time
in
prosecuting
the
liberty
of
the
press
for
he
would
be
the
supreme
master
of
the
whole
community
and
he
would
be
as
free
to
rid
himself
of
the
authors
as
of
their
writings
in
this
question
therefore
there
is
no
medium
between
servitude
and
extreme
license
in
order
to
enjoy
the
inestimable
benefits
which
the
liberty
of
the
press
ensures
it
is
necessary
to
submit
to
the
inevitable
evils
which
it
engenders
to
expect
to
acquire
the
former
and
to
escape
the
latter
is
to
cherish
one
of
those
illusions
which
commonly
mislead
nations
in
their
times
of
sickness
when
tired
with
faction
and
exhausted
by
effort
they
attempt
to
combine
hostile
opinions
and
contrary
principles
upon
the
same
soil
the
small
influence
of
the
american
journals
is
attributable
to
several
reasons
among
which
are
the
following
the
liberty
of
writing
like
all
other
liberty
is
most
formidable
when
it
is
a
novelty
for
a
people
which
has
never
been
accustomed
to
in
the
conduct
of
state
affairs
places
implicit
confidence
in
the
first
tribune
who
arouses
its
attention
the
have
enjoyed
this
liberty
ever
since
the
foundation
of
the
settlements
moreover
the
press
can
not
create
human
passions
by
its
own
power
however
skilfully
it
may
kindle
them
where
they
exist
in
america
politics
are
discussed
with
animation
and
a
varied
activity
but
they
rarely
touch
those
deep
passions
which
are
excited
whenever
the
positive
interest
of
a
part
of
the
community
is
impaired
but
in
the
united
states
the
interests
of
the
community
are
in
a
most
prosperous
condition
a
single
glance
upon
a
french
and
an
american
newspaper
is
sufficient
to
show
the
difference
which
exists
between
the
two
nations
on
this
head
in
france
the
space
allotted
to
commercial
advertisements
is
very
limited
and
the
intelligence
is
not
considerable
but
the
most
essential
part
of
the
journal
is
that
which
contains
the
discussion
of
the
politics
of
the
day
in
america
three
quarters
of
the
enormous
sheet
which
is
set
before
the
reader
are
filled
with
advertisements
and
the
remainder
is
frequently
occupied
by
political
intelligence
or
trivial
anecdotes
it
is
only
from
time
to
time
that
one
finds
a
corner
devoted
to
passionate
discussions
like
those
with
which
the
journalists
of
france
are
wont
to
indulge
their
readers
it
has
been
demonstrated
by
observation
and
discovered
by
the
innate
sagacity
of
the
pettiest
as
well
as
the
greatest
of
despots
that
the
influence
of
a
power
is
increased
in
proportion
as
its
direction
is
rendered
more
central
in
france
the
press
combines
a
twofold
centralisation
almost
all
its
power
is
centred
in
the
same
spot
and
vested
in
the
same
hands
for
its
organs
are
far
from
numerous
the
influence
of
a
public
press
thus
constituted
upon
a
sceptical
nation
must
be
unbounded
it
is
an
enemy
with
which
a
government
may
sign
an
occasional
truce
but
which
it
is
difficult
to
resist
for
any
length
of
time
neither
of
these
kinds
of
centralisation
exists
in
america
the
united
states
have
no
metropolis
the
intelligence
as
well
as
the
power
of
the
country
is
dispersed
abroad
and
instead
of
radiating
from
a
point
they
cross
each
other
in
every
direction
the
americans
have
established
no
central
control
over
the
expression
of
opinion
any
more
than
over
the
conduct
of
business
these
are
circumstances
which
do
not
depend
on
human
foresight
but
it
is
owing
to
the
laws
of
the
union
that
there
are
no
licenses
to
be
granted
to
the
printers
no
securities
demanded
from
editors
as
in
france
and
no
stamp
duty
as
in
france
and
england
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
nothing
is
easier
than
to
set
up
a
newspaper
and
a
small
number
of
readers
suffices
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
editor
the
number
of
periodical
and
occasional
publications
which
appear
in
the
united
states
actually
surpasses
belief
the
most
enlightened
americans
attribute
the
subordinate
influence
of
the
press
to
this
excessive
dissemination
and
it
is
adopted
as
an
axiom
of
political
science
in
that
country
that
the
only
way
to
neutralise
the
effect
of
public
journals
is
to
multiply
them
indefinitely
i
can
not
conceive
why
a
truth
which
is
so
has
not
already
been
more
generally
admitted
in
europe
it
is
comprehensible
that
the
persons
who
hope
to
bring
about
revolutions
by
means
of
the
press
should
be
desirous
of
confining
its
action
to
a
few
powerful
organs
but
it
is
perfectly
incredible
that
the
partisans
of
the
existing
state
of
things
and
the
natural
supporters
of
the
laws
should
attempt
to
diminish
the
influence
of
the
press
by
concentrating
its
authority
the
governments
of
europe
seem
to
treat
the
press
with
the
courtesy
of
the
knights
of
old
they
are
anxious
to
furnish
it
with
the
same
central
power
which
they
have
found
to
be
so
trusty
a
weapon
in
order
to
enhance
the
glory
of
their
resistance
to
its
attacks
in
america
there
is
scarcely
a
hamlet
which
has
not
its
own
newspaper
it
may
readily
be
imagined
that
neither
discipline
nor
unity
of
design
can
be
communicated
to
so
multifarious
a
host
and
each
one
is
constantly
led
to
fight
under
his
own
standard
all
the
political
journals
of
the
united
states
are
indeed
arrayed
on
the
side
of
the
administration
or
against
it
but
they
attack
and
defend
it
in
a
thousand
different
ways
they
can
not
succeed
in
forming
those
great
currents
of
opinion
which
overwhelm
the
most
solid
obstacles
this
division
of
the
influence
of
the
press
produces
a
variety
of
other
consequences
which
are
scarcely
less
remarkable
the
facility
with
which
journals
can
be
established
induces
a
multitude
of
individuals
to
take
a
part
in
them
but
as
the
extent
of
competition
precludes
the
possibility
of
considerable
profit
the
most
distinguished
classes
of
society
are
rarely
led
to
engage
in
these
undertakings
but
such
is
the
number
of
the
public
prints
that
even
if
they
were
a
source
of
wealth
writers
of
ability
could
not
be
found
to
direct
them
all
the
journalists
of
the
united
states
are
usually
placed
in
a
very
humble
position
with
a
scanty
education
and
a
vulgar
turn
of
mind
the
will
of
the
majority
is
the
most
general
of
laws
and
it
establishes
certain
habits
which
form
the
characteristics
of
each
peculiar
class
of
society
thus
it
dictates
the
etiquette
practised
at
courts
and
the
etiquette
of
the
bar
the
characteristics
of
the
french
journalist
consist
in
a
violent
but
frequently
an
eloquent
and
lofty
manner
of
discussing
the
politics
of
the
day
and
the
exceptions
to
this
habitual
practice
are
only
occasional
the
characteristics
of
the
american
journalist
consist
in
an
open
and
coarse
appeal
to
the
passions
of
the
populace
and
he
habitually
abandons
the
principles
of
political
science
to
assail
the
characters
of
individuals
to
track
them
into
private
life
and
disclose
all
their
weaknesses
and
errors
nothing
can
be
more
deplorable
than
this
abuse
of
the
powers
of
thought
i
shall
have
occasion
to
point
out
hereafter
the
influence
of
the
newspapers
upon
the
taste
and
the
morality
of
the
american
people
but
my
present
subject
exclusively
concerns
the
political
world
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
effects
of
this
extreme
license
of
the
press
tend
indirectly
to
the
maintenance
of
public
order
the
individuals
who
are
already
in
possession
of
a
high
station
in
the
esteem
of
their
fellow
citizens
are
afraid
to
write
in
the
newspapers
and
they
are
thus
deprived
of
the
most
powerful
instrument
which
they
can
use
to
excite
the
passions
of
the
multitude
to
their
own
advantage
the
personal
opinions
of
the
editors
have
no
kind
of
weight
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
the
only
use
of
a
journal
is
that
it
imparts
the
knowledge
of
certain
facts
and
it
is
only
by
altering
or
distorting
those
facts
that
a
journalist
can
contribute
to
the
support
of
his
own
views
but
although
the
press
is
limited
to
these
resources
its
influence
in
america
is
immense
it
is
the
power
which
impels
the
circulation
of
political
life
through
all
the
districts
of
that
vast
territory
its
eye
is
constantly
open
to
detect
the
secret
springs
of
political
designs
and
to
summon
the
leaders
of
all
parties
to
the
bar
of
public
opinion
it
rallies
the
interests
of
the
community
round
certain
principles
and
it
draws
up
the
creed
which
factions
adopt
for
it
affords
a
means
of
intercourse
between
parties
which
hear
and
which
address
each
other
without
ever
having
been
in
immediate
contact
when
a
great
number
of
the
organs
of
the
press
adopt
the
same
line
of
conduct
their
influence
becomes
irresistible
and
public
opinion
when
it
is
perpetually
assailed
from
the
same
side
eventually
yields
to
the
attack
in
the
united
states
each
separate
journal
exercises
but
little
authority
but
the
power
of
the
periodical
press
is
only
second
to
that
of
the
people
in
the
united
states
the
democracy
perpetually
raises
fresh
individuals
to
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
and
the
measures
of
the
administration
are
consequently
seldom
regulated
by
the
strict
rules
of
consistency
or
of
order
but
the
general
principles
of
the
government
are
more
stable
and
the
opinions
most
prevalent
in
society
are
generally
more
durable
than
in
many
other
countries
when
once
the
americans
have
taken
up
an
idea
whether
it
be
well
or
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
eradicate
it
from
their
minds
the
same
tenacity
of
opinion
has
been
observed
in
england
where
for
the
last
century
greater
freedom
of
conscience
and
more
invincible
prejudices
have
existed
than
in
all
the
other
countries
of
europe
i
attribute
this
consequence
to
a
cause
which
may
at
first
sight
appear
to
have
a
very
opposite
tendency
namely
to
the
liberty
of
the
press
the
nations
among
which
this
liberty
exists
are
as
apt
to
cling
to
their
opinions
from
pride
as
from
conviction
they
cherish
them
because
they
hold
them
to
be
just
and
because
they
exercised
their
own
free
will
in
choosing
them
and
they
maintain
them
not
only
because
they
are
true
but
because
they
are
their
own
several
other
reasons
conduce
to
the
same
end
it
was
remarked
by
a
man
of
genius
that
ignorance
lies
at
the
two
ends
of
knowledge
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
correct
to
say
that
absolute
convictions
are
to
be
met
with
at
the
two
extremities
and
that
doubt
lies
in
the
middle
for
the
human
intellect
may
be
considered
in
three
distinct
states
which
frequently
succeed
one
another
a
man
believes
implicitly
because
he
adopts
a
proposition
without
inquiry
he
doubts
as
soon
as
he
is
assailed
by
the
objections
which
his
inquiries
may
have
aroused
but
he
frequently
succeeds
in
satisfying
these
doubts
and
then
he
begins
to
believe
afresh
he
no
longer
lays
hold
on
a
truth
in
its
most
shadowy
and
uncertain
form
but
he
sees
it
clearly
before
him
and
he
advances
onward
by
the
light
it
gives
him
when
the
liberty
of
the
press
acts
upon
men
who
are
in
the
first
of
these
three
states
it
does
not
immediately
disturb
their
habit
of
believing
implicitly
without
investigation
but
it
constantly
modifies
the
objects
of
their
intuitive
convictions
the
human
mind
continues
to
discern
but
one
point
upon
the
whole
intellectual
horizon
and
that
point
is
in
continual
motion
such
are
the
symptoms
of
sudden
revolutions
and
of
the
misfortunes
that
are
sure
to
befall
those
generations
which
abruptly
adopt
the
unconditional
freedom
of
the
press
the
circle
of
novel
ideas
is
however
soon
terminated
the
torch
of
experience
is
upon
them
and
the
doubt
and
mistrust
which
their
uncertainty
produces
become
universal
we
may
rest
assured
that
the
majority
of
mankind
will
either
believe
they
know
not
wherefore
or
will
not
know
what
to
believe
few
are
the
beings
who
can
ever
hope
to
attain
that
state
of
rational
and
independent
conviction
which
true
knowledge
can
beget
in
defiance
of
the
attacks
of
doubt
it
has
been
remarked
that
in
times
of
great
religious
fervor
men
sometimes
change
their
religious
opinions
whereas
in
times
of
general
scepticism
every
one
clings
to
his
own
persuasion
the
same
thing
takes
place
in
politics
under
the
liberty
of
the
press
in
countries
where
all
the
theories
of
social
science
have
been
contested
in
their
turn
the
citizens
who
have
adopted
one
of
them
stick
to
it
not
so
much
because
they
are
assured
of
its
excellence
as
because
they
are
not
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
any
other
in
the
present
age
men
are
not
very
ready
to
die
in
defence
of
their
opinions
but
they
are
rarely
inclined
to
change
them
and
there
are
fewer
martyrs
as
well
as
fewer
apostates
another
still
more
valid
reason
may
yet
be
adduced
when
no
abstract
opinions
are
looked
upon
as
certain
men
cling
to
the
mere
propensities
and
external
interest
of
their
position
which
are
naturally
more
tangible
and
more
permanent
than
any
opinions
in
the
world
it
is
not
a
question
of
easy
solution
whether
the
aristocracy
or
the
democracy
is
most
fit
to
govern
a
country
but
it
is
certain
that
democracy
annoys
one
part
of
the
community
and
that
aristocracy
oppresses
another
part
when
the
question
is
reduced
to
the
simple
expression
of
the
struggle
between
poverty
and
wealth
the
tendency
of
each
side
of
the
dispute
becomes
perfectly
evident
without
farther
controversy
notes
they
only
write
in
the
papers
when
they
choose
to
address
the
people
in
their
own
name
as
for
instance
when
they
are
called
upon
to
repel
calumnious
imputations
and
to
correct
a
of
facts
see
appendix
it
may
however
be
doubted
whether
this
rational
and
conviction
arouses
as
much
fervor
or
enthusiastic
devotedness
in
men
as
their
first
dogmatical
belief

political
associations
in
the
united
states
daily
use
which
the
make
of
the
right
of
three
kinds
of
political
in
what
manner
the
americans
apply
the
representative
system
to
dangers
resulting
to
the
great
convention
of
relative
to
the
tariff
legislative
character
of
this
why
the
unlimited
exercise
of
the
right
of
association
is
less
dangerous
in
the
united
states
than
why
it
may
be
looked
upon
as
utility
of
associations
in
a
democratic
people
in
no
country
in
the
world
has
the
principle
of
association
been
more
successfully
used
or
more
unsparingly
applied
to
a
multitude
of
different
objects
than
in
america
beside
the
permanent
associations
which
are
established
by
law
under
the
names
of
townships
cities
and
counties
a
vast
number
of
others
are
formed
and
maintained
by
the
agency
of
private
individuals
the
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
taught
from
his
earliest
infancy
to
rely
upon
his
own
exertions
in
order
to
resist
the
evils
and
the
difficulties
of
life
he
looks
upon
the
social
authority
with
an
eye
of
mistrust
and
anxiety
and
he
only
claims
its
assistance
when
he
is
quite
unable
to
shift
without
it
this
habit
may
even
be
traced
in
the
schools
of
the
rising
generation
where
the
children
in
their
games
are
wont
to
submit
to
rules
which
they
have
themselves
established
and
to
punish
misdemeanors
which
they
have
themselves
defined
the
same
spirit
pervades
every
act
of
social
life
if
a
stoppage
occurs
in
a
thoroughfare
and
the
circulation
of
the
public
is
hindered
the
neighbors
immediately
constitute
a
deliberative
body
and
this
extemporaneous
assembly
gives
rise
to
an
executive
power
which
remedies
the
inconvenience
before
anybody
has
thought
of
recurring
to
an
authority
superior
to
that
of
the
persons
immediately
concerned
if
the
public
pleasures
are
concerned
an
association
is
formed
to
provide
for
the
splendor
and
the
regularity
of
the
entertainment
societies
are
formed
to
resist
enemies
which
are
exclusively
of
a
moral
nature
and
to
diminish
the
vice
of
intemperance
in
the
united
states
associations
are
established
to
promote
public
order
commerce
industry
morality
and
religion
for
there
is
no
end
which
the
human
will
seconded
by
the
collective
exertions
of
individuals
despairs
of
attaining
i
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
show
the
effects
of
association
upon
the
course
of
society
and
i
must
confine
myself
for
the
present
to
the
political
world
when
once
the
right
of
association
is
recognized
the
citizens
may
employ
it
in
several
different
ways
an
association
consists
simply
in
the
public
assent
which
a
number
of
individuals
give
to
certain
doctrines
and
in
the
engagement
which
they
contract
to
promote
the
spread
of
those
doctrines
by
their
exertions
the
right
of
associating
with
these
views
is
very
analogous
to
the
liberty
of
unlicensed
writing
but
societies
thus
formed
possess
more
authority
than
the
press
when
an
opinion
is
represented
by
a
society
it
necessarily
assumes
a
more
exact
and
explicit
form
it
numbers
its
partisans
and
compromises
their
welfare
in
its
cause
they
on
the
other
hand
become
acquainted
with
each
other
and
their
zeal
is
increased
by
their
number
an
association
unites
the
efforts
of
minds
which
have
a
tendency
to
diverge
in
one
single
channel
and
urges
them
vigorously
toward
one
single
end
which
it
points
out
the
second
degree
in
the
right
of
association
is
the
power
of
meeting
when
an
association
is
allowed
to
establish
centres
of
action
at
certain
important
points
in
the
country
its
activity
is
increased
and
its
influence
extended
men
have
the
opportunity
of
seeing
each
other
means
of
execution
are
more
readily
combined
and
opinions
are
maintained
with
a
degree
of
warmth
and
energy
which
written
language
can
not
approach
lastly
in
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
political
association
there
is
a
third
degree
the
partisans
of
an
opinion
may
unite
in
electoral
bodies
and
choose
delegates
to
represent
them
in
a
central
assembly
this
is
properly
speaking
the
application
of
the
representative
system
to
a
party
thus
in
the
first
instance
a
society
is
formed
between
individuals
professing
the
same
opinion
and
the
tie
which
keeps
it
together
is
of
a
purely
intellectual
nature
in
the
second
case
small
assemblies
are
formed
which
only
represent
a
fraction
of
the
party
lastly
in
the
third
case
they
constitute
a
separate
nation
in
the
midst
of
the
nation
a
government
within
the
government
their
delegates
like
the
real
delegates
of
the
majority
represent
the
entire
collective
force
of
their
party
and
they
enjoy
a
certain
degree
of
that
national
dignity
and
great
influence
which
belong
to
the
chosen
representatives
of
the
people
it
is
true
that
they
have
not
the
right
of
making
the
laws
but
they
have
the
power
of
attacking
those
which
are
in
being
and
of
drawing
up
beforehand
those
which
they
may
afterward
cause
to
be
adopted
if
in
a
people
which
is
imperfectly
accustomed
to
the
exercise
of
freedom
or
which
is
exposed
to
violent
political
passions
a
deliberating
minority
which
confines
itself
to
the
contemplation
of
future
laws
be
placed
in
juxtaposition
to
the
legislative
majority
i
can
not
but
believe
that
public
tranquillity
incurs
very
great
risks
in
that
nation
there
is
doubtless
a
very
wide
difference
between
proving
that
one
law
is
in
itself
better
than
another
and
proving
that
the
former
ought
to
be
substituted
for
the
latter
but
the
imagination
of
the
populace
is
very
apt
to
overlook
this
difference
which
is
so
apparent
in
the
minds
of
thinking
men
it
sometimes
happens
that
a
nation
is
divided
into
two
nearly
equal
parties
each
of
which
affects
to
represent
the
majority
if
in
immediate
contiguity
to
the
directing
power
another
power
be
established
which
exercises
almost
as
much
moral
authority
as
the
former
it
is
not
to
be
believed
that
it
will
long
be
content
to
speak
without
acting
or
that
it
will
always
be
restrained
by
the
abstract
consideration
of
the
nature
of
associations
which
are
meant
to
direct
but
not
to
enforce
opinions
to
suggest
but
not
to
make
the
laws
the
more
we
consider
the
independence
of
the
press
in
its
principal
consequences
the
more
are
we
convinced
that
it
is
the
chief
and
so
to
speak
the
constitutive
element
of
freedom
in
the
modern
world
a
nation
which
is
determined
to
remain
free
is
therefore
right
in
demanding
the
unrestrained
exercise
of
this
independence
but
the
liberty
of
political
association
can
not
be
entirely
assimilated
to
the
liberty
of
the
press
the
one
is
at
the
same
time
less
necessary
and
more
dangerous
than
the
other
a
nation
may
confine
it
within
certain
limits
without
forfeiting
any
part
of
its
and
it
may
sometimes
be
obliged
to
do
so
in
order
to
maintain
its
own
authority
in
america
the
liberty
of
association
for
political
purposes
is
unbounded
an
example
will
show
in
the
clearest
light
to
what
an
extent
this
privilege
is
tolerated
the
question
of
the
tariff
or
of
free
trade
produced
a
great
manifestation
of
party
feeling
in
america
the
tariff
was
not
only
a
subject
of
debate
as
a
matter
of
opinion
but
it
exercised
a
favorable
or
a
prejudicial
influence
upon
several
very
powerful
interests
of
the
states
the
north
attributed
a
great
portion
of
its
prosperity
and
the
south
all
its
sufferings
to
this
system
insomuch
that
for
a
long
time
the
tariff
was
the
sole
source
of
the
political
animosities
which
agitated
the
union
in
when
the
dispute
was
raging
with
the
utmost
virulence
a
private
citizen
of
massachusetts
proposed
to
all
the
enemies
of
the
tariff
by
means
of
the
public
prints
to
send
delegates
to
philadelphia
in
order
to
consult
together
upon
the
means
which
were
most
fitted
to
promote
the
freedom
of
trade
this
proposal
circulated
in
a
few
days
from
maine
to
new
orleans
by
the
power
of
the
printing
press
the
opponents
of
the
tariff
adopted
it
with
enthusiasm
meetings
were
formed
on
all
sides
and
delegates
were
named
the
majority
of
these
individuals
were
well
known
and
some
of
them
had
earned
a
considerable
degree
of
celebrity
south
carolina
alone
which
afterward
took
up
arms
in
the
same
cause
sent
delegates
on
the
october
this
assembly
which
according
to
the
american
custom
had
taken
the
name
of
a
convention
met
at
philadelphia
it
consisted
of
more
than
two
hundred
members
its
debates
were
public
and
they
at
once
assumed
a
legislative
character
the
extent
of
the
powers
of
congress
the
theories
of
free
trade
and
the
different
clauses
of
the
tariff
were
discussed
in
turn
at
the
end
of
ten
days
deliberation
the
convention
broke
up
after
having
published
an
address
to
the
american
people
in
which
it
is
declared
i
the
congress
had
not
the
right
of
making
a
tariff
and
that
the
existing
tariff
was
unconstitutional
ii
that
the
prohibition
of
free
trade
was
prejudicial
to
the
interests
of
all
nations
and
to
that
of
the
american
people
in
particular
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
unrestrained
liberty
of
political
association
has
not
hitherto
produced
in
the
united
states
those
fatal
consequences
which
might
perhaps
be
expected
from
it
elsewhere
the
right
of
association
was
imported
from
england
and
it
has
always
existed
in
america
so
that
the
exercise
of
this
privilege
is
now
amalgamated
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
people
at
the
present
time
the
liberty
of
association
is
become
a
necessary
guarantee
against
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
in
the
united
states
as
soon
as
a
party
has
become
preponderant
all
the
public
authority
passes
under
its
control
its
private
supporters
occupy
all
the
places
and
have
all
the
force
of
the
administration
at
their
disposal
as
the
most
distinguished
partisans
of
the
other
side
of
the
question
are
unable
to
surmount
the
obstacles
which
exclude
them
from
power
they
require
some
means
of
establishing
themselves
upon
their
own
basis
and
of
opposing
the
moral
authority
of
the
minority
to
the
physical
power
which
domineers
over
it
thus
a
dangerous
expedient
is
used
to
obviate
a
still
more
formidable
danger
the
omnipotence
of
the
majority
appears
to
me
to
present
such
extreme
perils
to
the
american
republics
that
the
dangerous
measure
which
is
used
to
repress
it
seems
to
be
more
advantageous
than
prejudicial
and
here
i
am
about
to
advance
a
proposition
which
may
remind
the
reader
of
what
i
said
before
in
speaking
of
municipal
freedom
there
are
no
countries
in
which
associations
are
more
needed
to
prevent
the
despotism
of
faction
or
the
arbitrary
power
of
a
prince
than
those
which
are
democratically
constituted
in
aristocratic
nations
the
body
of
the
nobles
and
the
more
opulent
part
of
the
community
are
in
themselves
natural
associations
which
act
as
checks
upon
the
abuses
of
power
in
countries
in
which
those
associations
do
not
exist
if
private
individuals
are
unable
to
create
an
artificial
and
a
temporary
substitute
for
them
i
can
imagine
no
permanent
protection
against
the
most
galling
tyranny
and
a
great
people
may
be
oppressed
by
a
small
faction
or
by
a
single
individual
with
impunity
the
meeting
of
a
great
political
convention
for
there
are
conventions
of
all
kinds
which
may
frequently
become
a
necessary
measure
is
always
a
serious
occurrence
even
in
america
and
one
which
is
never
looked
forward
to
by
the
judicious
friends
of
the
country
without
alarm
this
was
very
perceptible
in
the
convention
of
at
which
the
exertions
of
all
the
most
distinguished
members
of
the
assembly
tended
to
moderate
its
language
and
to
restrain
the
subjects
which
it
treated
within
certain
limits
it
is
probable
in
fact
that
the
convention
of
exercised
a
very
great
influence
upon
the
minds
of
the
malcontents
and
prepared
them
for
the
open
revolt
against
the
commercial
laws
of
the
union
which
took
place
in
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
unrestrained
liberty
of
association
for
political
purposes
is
the
privilege
which
a
people
is
longest
in
learning
how
to
exercise
if
it
does
not
throw
the
nation
into
anarchy
it
perpetually
augments
the
chances
of
that
calamity
on
one
point
however
this
perilous
liberty
offers
a
security
against
dangers
of
another
kind
in
countries
where
associations
are
free
secret
societies
are
unknown
in
america
there
are
numerous
factions
but
no
conspiracies
the
most
natural
privilege
of
man
next
to
the
right
of
acting
for
himself
is
that
of
combining
his
exertions
with
those
of
his
and
of
acting
in
common
with
them
i
am
therefore
led
to
conclude
that
the
right
of
association
is
almost
as
inalienable
as
the
right
of
personal
liberty
no
legislator
can
attack
it
without
impairing
the
very
foundations
of
society
nevertheless
if
the
liberty
of
association
is
a
fruitful
source
of
advantages
and
prosperity
to
some
nations
it
may
be
perverted
or
carried
to
excess
by
others
and
the
element
of
life
may
be
changed
into
an
element
of
destruction
a
comparison
of
the
different
methods
which
associations
pursue
in
those
countries
in
which
they
are
managed
with
discretion
as
well
as
in
those
where
liberty
degenerates
into
license
may
perhaps
be
thought
useful
both
to
governments
and
to
parties
the
greater
part
of
europeans
look
upon
an
association
as
a
weapon
which
is
to
be
hastily
fashioned
and
immediately
tried
in
the
conflict
a
society
is
to
be
formed
for
discussion
but
the
idea
of
impending
action
prevails
in
the
minds
of
those
who
constitute
it
it
is
in
fact
an
army
and
the
time
given
to
parley
serves
to
reckon
up
the
strength
and
to
animate
the
courage
of
the
host
after
which
they
direct
the
march
against
the
enemy
resources
which
lie
within
the
bounds
of
the
law
may
suggest
themselves
to
the
persons
who
compose
it
as
means
but
never
as
the
only
means
of
success
such
however
is
not
the
manner
in
which
the
right
of
association
is
understood
in
the
united
states
in
america
the
citizens
who
form
the
minority
associate
in
order
in
the
first
place
to
show
their
numerical
strength
and
so
to
diminish
the
moral
authority
of
the
majority
and
in
the
second
place
to
stimulate
competition
and
to
discover
those
arguments
which
are
most
fitted
to
act
upon
the
majority
for
they
always
entertain
hopes
of
drawing
over
their
opponents
to
their
own
side
and
of
afterward
disposing
of
the
supreme
power
in
their
name
political
associations
in
the
united
states
are
therefore
peaceable
in
their
intentions
and
strictly
legal
in
the
means
which
they
employ
and
they
assert
with
perfect
truth
that
they
only
aim
at
success
by
lawful
expedients
the
difference
which
exists
between
the
americans
and
ourselves
depends
on
several
causes
in
europe
there
are
numerous
parties
so
diametrically
opposed
to
the
majority
that
they
can
never
hope
to
acquire
its
support
and
at
the
same
time
they
think
that
they
are
sufficiently
strong
in
themselves
to
struggle
and
to
defend
their
cause
when
a
party
of
this
kind
forms
an
association
its
object
is
not
to
conquer
but
to
fight
in
america
the
individuals
who
hold
opinions
very
much
opposed
to
those
of
the
majority
are
no
sort
of
impediment
to
its
power
and
all
other
parties
hope
to
win
it
over
to
their
own
principles
in
the
end
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
association
becomes
dangerous
in
proportion
to
the
impossibility
which
excludes
great
parties
from
acquiring
the
majority
in
a
country
like
the
united
states
in
which
the
differences
of
opinion
are
mere
differences
of
hue
the
right
of
association
may
remain
unrestrained
without
evil
consequences
the
inexperience
of
many
of
the
european
nations
in
the
enjoyment
of
liberty
leads
them
only
to
look
upon
the
liberty
of
association
as
a
right
of
attacking
the
government
the
first
notion
which
presents
itself
to
a
party
as
well
as
to
an
individual
when
it
has
acquired
a
consciousness
of
its
own
strength
is
that
of
violence
the
notion
of
persuasion
arises
at
a
later
period
and
is
only
derived
from
experience
the
english
who
are
divided
into
parties
which
differ
most
essentially
from
each
other
rarely
abuse
the
right
of
association
because
they
have
long
been
accustomed
to
exercise
it
in
france
the
passion
for
war
is
so
intense
that
there
is
no
undertaking
so
mad
or
so
injurious
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
that
a
man
does
not
consider
himself
honored
in
defending
it
at
the
risk
of
his
life
but
perhaps
the
most
powerful
of
the
causes
which
tend
to
mitigate
the
excesses
of
political
association
in
the
united
states
is
universal
suffrage
in
countries
in
which
universal
suffrage
exists
the
majority
is
never
doubtful
because
neither
party
can
pretend
to
represent
that
portion
of
the
community
which
has
not
voted
the
associations
which
are
formed
are
aware
as
well
as
the
nation
at
large
that
they
do
not
represent
the
majority
this
is
indeed
a
condition
inseparable
from
their
existence
for
if
they
did
represent
the
preponderating
power
they
would
change
the
law
instead
of
soliciting
its
reform
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
the
moral
influence
of
the
government
which
they
attack
is
very
much
increased
and
their
own
power
is
very
much
enfeebled
in
europe
there
are
few
associations
which
do
not
affect
to
represent
the
majority
or
which
do
not
believe
that
they
represent
it
this
conviction
or
this
pretension
tends
to
augment
their
force
amazingly
and
contributes
no
less
to
legalize
their
measures
violence
may
seem
to
be
excusable
in
defence
of
the
cause
of
oppressed
right
thus
it
is
in
the
vast
labyrinth
of
human
laws
that
extreme
liberty
sometimes
corrects
abuses
of
license
and
that
extreme
democracy
obviates
the
dangers
of
democratic
government
in
europe
associations
consider
themselves
in
some
degree
as
the
legislative
and
executive
councils
of
the
people
which
is
unable
to
speak
for
itself
in
america
where
they
only
represent
a
minority
of
the
nation
they
argue
and
they
petition
the
means
which
the
associations
of
europe
employ
are
in
accordance
with
the
end
which
they
propose
to
obtain
as
the
principal
aim
of
these
bodies
is
to
act
and
not
to
debate
to
fight
rather
than
to
persuade
they
are
naturally
led
to
adopt
a
form
of
organization
which
differs
from
the
ordinary
customs
of
civil
bodies
and
which
assumes
the
habits
and
the
maxims
of
military
life
they
centralize
the
direction
of
their
resources
as
much
as
possible
and
they
intrust
the
power
of
the
whole
party
to
a
very
small
number
of
leaders
the
members
of
these
associations
reply
to
a
watchword
like
soldiers
on
duty
they
profess
the
doctrine
of
passive
obedience
say
rather
that
in
uniting
together
they
at
once
abjure
the
exercise
of
their
own
judgment
and
free
will
and
the
tyrannical
control
which
these
societies
exercise
is
often
far
more
insupportable
than
the
authority
possessed
over
society
by
the
government
which
they
attack
their
moral
force
is
much
diminished
by
these
excesses
and
they
lose
the
powerful
interest
which
is
always
excited
by
a
struggle
between
oppressors
and
the
oppressed
the
man
who
in
given
cases
consents
to
obey
his
fellows
with
servility
and
who
submits
his
activity
and
even
his
opinions
to
their
control
can
have
no
claim
to
rank
as
a
free
citizen
the
americans
have
also
established
certain
forms
of
government
which
are
applied
to
their
associations
but
these
are
invariably
borrowed
from
the
forms
of
the
civil
administration
the
independence
of
each
individual
is
formally
recognized
the
tendency
of
the
members
of
the
association
points
as
it
does
in
the
body
of
the
community
toward
the
same
end
but
they
are
not
obliged
to
follow
the
same
track
no
one
abjures
the
exercise
of
his
reason
and
his
free
will
but
every
one
exerts
that
reason
and
that
will
for
the
benefit
of
a
common
undertaking
chapter
xiii
government
of
the
democracy
in
america
i
am
well
aware
of
the
difficulties
which
attend
this
part
of
my
subject
but
although
every
expression
which
i
am
about
to
make
use
of
may
clash
upon
some
one
point
with
the
feelings
of
the
different
parties
which
divide
my
country
i
shall
speak
my
opinion
with
the
most
perfect
openness
in
europe
we
are
at
a
loss
how
to
judge
the
true
character
and
the
more
permanent
propensities
of
democracy
because
in
europe
two
conflicting
principles
exist
and
we
do
not
know
what
to
attribute
to
the
principles
themselves
and
what
to
refer
to
the
passions
which
they
bring
into
collision
such
however
is
not
the
case
in
america
there
the
people
reigns
without
any
obstacle
and
it
has
no
perils
to
dread
and
no
injuries
to
avenge
in
america
democracy
is
swayed
by
its
own
free
propensities
its
course
is
natural
and
its
activity
is
unrestrained
the
united
states
consequently
afford
the
most
favorable
opportunity
of
studying
its
real
character
and
to
no
people
can
this
inquiry
be
more
vitally
interesting
than
to
the
french
nation
which
is
blindly
driven
onward
by
a
daily
and
irresistible
impulse
toward
a
state
of
things
which
may
prove
either
despotic
or
republican
but
which
will
assuredly
be
democratic
universal
suffrage
i
have
already
observed
that
universal
suffrage
has
been
adopted
in
all
the
states
of
the
union
it
consequently
occurs
among
different
populations
which
occupy
very
different
positions
in
the
scale
of
society
i
have
had
opportunities
of
observing
its
effects
in
different
localities
and
among
races
of
men
who
are
nearly
strangers
to
each
other
by
their
language
their
religion
and
their
manner
of
life
in
louisiana
as
well
as
in
new
england
in
georgia
and
in
canada
i
have
remarked
that
universal
suffrage
is
far
from
producing
in
america
either
all
the
good
or
all
the
evil
consequences
which
are
assigned
to
it
in
europe
and
that
its
effects
differ
very
widely
from
those
which
are
usually
attributed
to
it
choice
of
the
people
and
instinctive
preferences
of
the
american
democracy
in
the
united
states
the
most
talented
individuals
are
rarely
placed
at
the
head
of
reasons
of
this
the
envy
which
prevails
in
the
lower
orders
of
france
against
the
higher
classes
is
not
a
french
but
a
purely
democratic
for
what
reason
the
most
distinguished
men
in
america
frequently
seclude
themselves
from
public
affairs
many
people
in
europe
are
apt
to
believe
without
saying
it
or
to
say
without
believing
it
that
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
universal
suffrage
is
that
it
intrusts
the
direction
of
public
affairs
to
men
who
are
worthy
of
the
public
confidence
they
admit
that
the
people
is
unable
to
govern
for
itself
but
they
aver
that
it
is
always
sincerely
disposed
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
state
and
that
it
instinctively
designates
those
persons
who
are
animated
by
the
same
good
wishes
and
who
are
the
most
fit
to
wield
the
supreme
authority
i
confess
that
the
observations
i
made
in
america
by
no
means
coincide
with
these
opinions
on
my
arrival
in
the
united
states
i
was
surprised
to
find
so
much
distinguished
talent
among
the
subjects
and
so
little
among
the
heads
of
the
government
it
is
a
fact
that
at
the
present
day
the
most
talented
men
in
the
united
states
are
very
rarely
placed
at
the
head
of
affairs
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
such
has
been
the
result
in
proportion
as
democracy
has
outstepped
all
its
former
limits
the
race
of
american
statesmen
has
evidently
dwindled
most
remarkably
in
the
course
of
the
last
fifty
years
several
causes
may
be
assigned
to
this
phenomenon
it
is
impossible
notwithstanding
the
most
strenuous
exertions
to
raise
the
intelligence
of
the
people
above
a
certain
level
whatever
may
be
the
facilities
of
acquiring
information
whatever
may
be
the
profusion
of
easy
methods
and
of
cheap
science
the
human
mind
can
never
be
instructed
and
educated
without
devoting
a
considerable
space
of
time
to
those
objects
the
greater
or
the
lesser
possibility
of
subsisting
without
labor
is
therefore
the
necessary
boundary
of
intellectual
improvement
this
boundary
is
more
remote
in
some
countries
and
more
restricted
in
others
but
it
must
exist
somewhere
as
long
as
the
people
is
constrained
to
work
in
order
to
procure
the
means
of
physical
subsistence
that
is
to
say
as
long
as
it
retains
its
popular
character
it
is
therefore
quite
as
difficult
to
imagine
a
state
in
which
all
the
citizens
should
be
very
as
a
state
in
which
they
should
all
be
wealthy
these
two
difficulties
may
be
looked
upon
as
correlative
it
may
very
readily
be
admitted
that
the
mass
of
the
citizens
are
sincerely
disposed
to
promote
the
welfare
of
their
country
nay
more
it
may
even
be
allowed
that
the
lower
classes
are
less
apt
to
be
swayed
by
considerations
of
personal
interest
than
the
higher
orders
but
it
is
always
more
or
less
impossible
for
them
to
discern
the
best
means
of
attaining
the
end
which
they
desire
with
sincerity
long
and
patient
observation
joined
to
a
multitude
of
different
notions
is
required
to
form
a
just
estimate
of
the
character
of
a
single
individual
and
can
it
be
supposed
that
the
vulgar
have
the
power
of
succeeding
in
an
inquiry
which
misleads
the
penetration
of
genius
itself
the
people
has
neither
the
time
nor
the
means
which
are
essential
to
the
prosecution
of
an
investigation
of
this
kind
its
conclusions
are
hastily
formed
from
a
superficial
inspection
of
the
more
prominent
features
of
a
question
hence
it
often
assents
to
the
clamor
of
a
mountebank
who
knows
the
secret
of
stimulating
its
tastes
while
its
truest
friends
frequently
fail
in
their
exertions
moreover
the
democracy
is
not
only
deficient
in
that
soundness
of
judgment
which
is
necessary
to
select
men
really
deserving
of
its
confidence
but
it
has
neither
the
desire
nor
the
inclination
to
find
them
out
it
can
not
be
denied
that
democratic
institutions
have
a
very
strong
tendency
to
promote
the
feeling
of
envy
in
the
human
heart
not
so
much
because
they
afford
to
every
one
the
means
of
rising
to
the
level
of
any
of
his
as
because
those
means
perpetually
disappoint
the
persons
who
employ
them
democratic
institutions
awaken
and
foster
a
passion
for
equality
which
they
can
never
entirely
satisfy
this
complete
equality
eludes
the
grasp
of
the
people
at
the
very
moment
when
it
thinks
to
hold
it
fast
and
flies
as
pascal
says
with
eternal
flight
the
people
is
excited
in
the
pursuit
of
an
advantage
which
is
the
more
precious
because
it
is
not
sufficiently
remote
to
be
unknown
or
sufficiently
near
to
be
enjoyed
the
lower
orders
are
agitated
by
the
chance
of
success
they
are
irritated
by
its
uncertainty
and
they
pass
from
the
enthusiasm
of
pursuit
to
the
exhaustion
of
and
lastly
to
the
acrimony
of
disappointment
whatever
transcends
their
own
limits
appears
to
be
an
obstacle
to
their
desires
and
there
is
no
kind
of
superiority
however
legitimate
it
may
be
which
is
not
irksome
in
their
sight
it
has
been
supposed
that
the
secret
instinct
which
leads
the
lower
orders
to
remove
their
superiors
as
much
as
possible
from
the
direction
of
public
affairs
is
peculiar
to
france
this
however
is
an
error
the
propensity
to
which
i
allude
is
not
inherent
in
any
particular
nation
but
in
democratic
institutions
in
general
and
although
it
may
have
been
heightened
by
peculiar
political
circumstances
it
owes
its
origin
to
a
higher
cause
in
the
united
states
the
people
is
not
disposed
to
hate
the
superior
class
of
society
but
it
is
not
very
favorably
inclined
toward
them
and
it
carefully
excludes
them
from
the
exercise
of
authority
it
does
not
entertain
any
dread
of
distinguished
talents
but
it
is
rarely
captivated
by
them
and
it
awards
its
approbation
very
sparingly
to
such
as
have
risen
without
the
popular
support
while
the
natural
propensities
of
democracy
induce
the
people
to
reject
the
most
distinguished
citizens
as
its
rulers
these
individuals
are
no
less
apt
to
retire
from
a
political
career
in
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
retain
their
independence
or
to
advance
without
degrading
themselves
this
opinion
has
been
very
candidly
set
forth
by
chancellor
kent
who
says
in
speaking
with
great
eulogium
of
that
part
of
the
constitution
which
empowers
the
executive
to
nominate
the
judges
it
is
indeed
probable
that
the
men
who
are
best
fitted
to
discharge
the
duties
of
this
high
office
would
have
too
much
reserve
in
their
manners
and
too
much
austerity
in
their
principles
for
them
to
be
returned
by
the
majority
at
an
election
where
universal
suffrage
is
adopted
such
were
the
opinions
which
were
printed
without
contradiction
in
america
in
the
year
i
hold
it
to
be
sufficiently
demonstrated
that
universal
suffrage
is
by
no
means
a
guarantee
of
the
wisdom
of
the
popular
choice
and
that
whatever
its
advantages
may
be
this
is
not
one
of
them
causes
which
may
partly
correct
these
tendencies
of
the
democracy
contrary
effects
produced
on
peoples
as
well
as
on
individuals
by
great
why
so
many
distinguished
men
stood
at
the
head
of
affairs
in
america
fifty
years
influence
which
the
intelligence
and
the
manners
of
the
people
exercise
upon
its
example
of
new
states
of
the
southwest
influence
of
certain
laws
upon
the
choice
of
the
election
by
an
elected
its
effects
upon
the
composition
of
the
senate
when
a
state
is
threatened
by
serious
dangers
the
people
frequently
succeed
in
selecting
the
citizens
who
are
the
most
able
to
save
it
it
has
been
observed
that
man
rarely
retains
his
customary
level
in
presence
of
very
critical
circumstances
he
rises
above
or
he
sinks
below
his
usual
condition
and
the
same
thing
occurs
in
nations
at
large
extreme
perils
sometimes
quench
the
energy
of
a
people
instead
of
stimulating
it
they
excite
without
directing
its
passions
and
instead
of
clearing
they
confuse
its
powers
of
perception
the
jews
deluged
the
smoking
ruins
of
their
temples
with
the
carnage
of
the
remnant
of
their
host
but
it
is
more
common
both
in
the
case
of
nations
and
in
that
of
individuals
to
find
extraordinary
virtues
arising
from
the
very
imminence
of
the
danger
great
characters
are
then
thrown
into
relief
as
the
edifices
which
are
concealed
by
the
gloom
of
night
are
illuminated
by
the
glare
of
a
conflagration
at
those
dangerous
times
genius
no
longer
abstains
from
presenting
itself
in
the
arena
and
the
people
alarmed
by
the
perils
of
its
situation
buries
its
envious
passions
in
a
short
oblivion
great
names
may
then
be
drawn
from
the
urn
of
an
election
i
have
already
observed
that
the
american
statesmen
of
the
present
day
are
very
inferior
to
those
who
stood
at
the
head
of
affairs
fifty
years
ago
this
is
as
much
a
consequence
of
the
circumstances
as
of
the
laws
of
the
country
when
america
was
struggling
in
the
high
cause
of
independence
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
another
country
and
when
it
was
about
to
usher
a
new
nation
into
the
world
the
spirits
of
its
inhabitants
were
roused
to
the
height
which
their
great
efforts
required
in
this
general
excitement
the
most
distinguished
men
were
ready
to
forestall
the
wants
of
the
community
and
the
people
clung
to
them
for
support
and
placed
them
at
its
head
but
events
of
this
magnitude
are
rare
and
it
is
from
an
inspection
of
the
ordinary
course
of
affairs
that
our
judgment
must
be
formed
if
passing
occurrences
sometimes
act
as
checks
upon
the
passions
of
democracy
the
intelligence
and
the
manners
of
the
community
exercise
an
influence
which
is
not
less
powerful
and
far
more
permanent
this
is
extremely
perceptible
in
the
united
states
in
new
england
the
education
and
the
liberties
of
the
communities
were
engendered
by
the
moral
and
religious
principles
of
their
founders
where
society
has
acquired
a
sufficient
degree
of
stability
to
enable
it
to
hold
certain
maxims
and
to
retain
fixed
habits
the
lower
orders
are
accustomed
to
respect
intellectual
superiority
and
to
submit
to
it
without
complaint
although
they
set
at
naught
all
those
privileges
which
wealth
and
birth
have
introduced
among
mankind
the
democracy
in
new
england
consequently
makes
a
more
judicious
choice
than
it
does
elsewhere
but
as
we
descend
toward
the
south
to
those
states
in
which
the
constitution
of
society
is
more
modern
and
less
strong
where
instruction
is
less
general
and
where
the
principles
of
morality
of
religion
and
of
liberty
are
less
happily
combined
we
perceive
that
the
talents
and
the
virtues
of
those
who
are
in
authority
become
more
and
more
rare
lastly
when
we
arrive
at
the
new
southwestern
states
in
which
the
constitution
of
society
dates
but
from
yesterday
and
presents
an
agglomeration
of
adventurers
and
speculators
we
are
amazed
at
the
persons
who
are
invested
with
public
authority
and
we
are
led
to
ask
by
what
force
independent
of
the
legislation
and
of
the
men
who
direct
it
the
state
can
be
protected
and
society
be
made
to
flourish
there
are
certain
laws
of
a
democratic
nature
which
contribute
nevertheless
to
correct
in
some
measure
the
dangerous
tendencies
of
democracy
on
entering
the
house
of
representatives
at
washington
one
is
struck
by
the
vulgar
demeanor
of
that
great
assembly
the
eye
frequently
does
not
discover
a
man
of
celebrity
within
its
walls
its
members
are
almost
all
obscure
individuals
whose
names
present
no
associations
to
the
mind
they
are
mostly
men
in
trade
or
even
persons
belonging
to
the
lower
classes
of
society
in
a
country
in
which
education
is
very
general
it
is
said
that
the
representatives
of
the
people
do
not
always
know
how
to
write
correctly
at
a
few
yards
distance
from
this
spot
is
the
door
of
the
senate
which
contains
within
a
small
space
a
large
proportion
of
the
celebrated
men
of
america
scarcely
an
individual
is
to
be
perceived
in
it
who
does
not
recall
the
idea
of
an
active
and
illustrious
career
the
senate
is
composed
of
eloquent
advocates
distinguished
generals
wise
magistrates
and
statesmen
of
note
whose
language
would
at
all
times
do
honor
to
the
most
remarkable
parliamentary
debates
of
europe
what
then
is
the
cause
of
this
strange
contrast
and
why
are
the
most
able
citizens
to
be
found
in
one
assembly
rather
than
in
the
other
why
is
the
former
body
remarkable
for
its
vulgarity
and
its
poverty
of
talent
while
the
latter
seems
to
enjoy
a
monopoly
of
intelligence
and
of
sound
judgment
both
of
these
assemblies
emanate
from
the
people
both
of
them
are
chosen
by
universal
suffrage
and
no
voice
has
hitherto
been
heard
to
assert
in
america
that
the
senate
is
hostile
to
the
interests
of
the
people
from
what
cause
then
does
so
startling
a
difference
arise
the
only
reason
which
appears
to
me
adequately
to
account
for
it
is
that
the
house
of
representatives
is
elected
by
the
populace
directly
and
that
of
the
senate
is
elected
by
elected
bodies
the
whole
body
of
the
citizens
names
the
legislature
of
each
state
and
the
federal
constitution
converts
these
legislatures
into
so
many
electoral
bodies
which
return
the
members
of
the
senate
the
senators
are
elected
by
an
indirect
application
of
universal
suffrage
for
the
legislatures
which
name
them
are
not
aristocratic
or
privileged
bodies
which
exercise
the
electoral
franchise
in
their
own
right
but
they
are
chosen
by
the
totality
of
the
citizens
they
are
generally
elected
every
year
and
new
members
may
constantly
be
chosen
who
will
employ
their
electoral
rights
in
conformity
with
the
wishes
of
the
public
but
this
transmission
of
the
popular
authority
through
an
assembly
of
chosen
men
operates
an
important
change
in
it
by
refining
its
discretion
and
improving
the
forms
which
it
adopts
men
who
are
chosen
in
this
manner
accurately
represent
the
majority
of
the
nation
which
governs
them
but
they
represent
the
elevated
thoughts
which
are
current
in
the
community
the
generous
propensities
which
prompt
its
nobler
actions
rather
than
the
petty
passions
which
disturb
or
the
vices
which
disgrace
it
the
time
may
be
already
anticipated
at
which
the
american
republics
will
be
obliged
to
introduce
the
plan
of
election
by
an
elected
body
more
frequently
into
their
system
of
representation
or
they
will
incur
no
small
risk
of
perishing
miserably
among
the
shoals
of
democracy
and
here
i
have
no
scruple
in
confessing
that
i
look
upon
this
peculiar
system
of
election
as
the
only
means
of
bringing
the
exercise
of
political
power
to
the
level
of
all
classes
of
the
people
those
thinkers
who
regard
this
institution
as
the
exclusive
weapon
of
a
party
and
those
who
fear
on
the
other
hand
to
make
use
of
it
seem
to
me
to
fall
into
as
great
an
error
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
influence
which
the
american
democracy
has
exercised
on
the
laws
relating
to
elections
when
elections
are
rare
they
expose
the
state
to
a
violent
when
they
are
frequent
they
keep
up
a
degree
of
feverish
the
americans
have
preferred
the
second
of
these
two
mutability
of
the
opinions
of
hamilton
and
jefferson
on
this
subject
when
elections
recur
at
long
intervals
the
state
is
exposed
to
violent
agitation
every
time
they
take
place
parties
exert
themselves
to
the
utmost
in
order
to
gain
a
prize
which
is
so
rarely
within
their
reach
and
as
the
evil
is
almost
irremediable
for
the
candidates
who
fail
the
consequence
of
their
disappointed
ambition
may
prove
most
disastrous
if
on
the
other
hand
the
legal
struggle
can
be
repeated
within
a
short
space
of
time
the
defeated
parties
take
patience
when
elections
occur
frequently
this
recurrence
keeps
society
in
a
perpetual
state
of
feverish
excitement
and
imparts
a
continual
instability
to
public
affairs
thus
on
the
one
hand
the
state
is
exposed
to
the
perils
of
a
revolution
on
the
other
to
perpetual
mutability
the
former
system
threatens
the
very
existence
of
the
government
the
latter
is
an
obstacle
to
all
steady
and
consistent
policy
the
americans
have
preferred
the
second
of
these
evils
to
the
first
but
they
were
led
to
this
conclusion
by
their
instinct
much
more
than
by
their
reason
for
a
taste
for
variety
is
one
of
the
characteristic
passions
of
democracy
an
extraordinary
mutability
has
by
this
means
been
introduced
into
their
legislation
many
of
the
americans
consider
the
instability
of
their
laws
as
a
necessary
consequence
of
a
system
whose
general
results
are
beneficial
but
no
one
in
the
united
states
affects
to
deny
the
fact
of
this
instability
or
to
contend
that
it
is
not
a
great
evil
hamilton
after
having
demonstrated
the
utility
of
a
power
which
might
prevent
or
which
might
at
least
impede
the
promulgation
of
bad
laws
adds
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
the
power
of
preventing
bad
laws
includes
that
of
preventing
good
ones
and
may
be
used
to
the
one
purpose
as
well
as
to
the
other
but
this
objection
will
have
but
little
weight
with
those
who
can
properly
estimate
the
mischiefs
of
that
inconstancy
and
mutability
in
the
laws
which
form
the
greatest
blemish
in
the
character
and
genius
of
our
government
federalist
no
and
again
in
no
of
the
same
work
he
observes
the
facility
and
excess
of
seem
to
be
the
diseases
to
which
our
governments
are
most
liable
the
mischievous
effects
of
the
mutability
in
the
public
councils
arising
from
a
rapid
succession
of
new
members
would
fill
a
volume
every
new
election
in
the
states
is
found
to
change
one
half
of
the
representatives
from
this
change
of
men
must
proceed
a
change
of
opinions
and
of
measures
which
forfeits
the
respect
and
confidence
of
nations
poisons
the
blessings
of
liberty
itself
and
diminishes
the
attachment
and
reverence
of
the
people
toward
a
political
system
which
betrays
so
many
marks
of
infirmity
jefferson
himself
the
greatest
democrat
whom
the
democracy
of
america
has
as
yet
produced
pointed
out
the
same
evils
the
instability
of
our
laws
he
said
in
a
letter
to
madison
is
really
a
very
serious
inconvenience
i
think
we
ought
to
have
obviated
it
by
deciding
that
a
whole
year
should
always
be
allowed
to
elapse
between
the
bringing
in
of
a
bill
and
the
final
passing
of
it
it
should
afterward
be
discussed
and
put
to
the
vote
without
the
possibility
of
making
any
alteration
in
it
and
if
the
circumstances
of
the
case
required
a
more
speedy
decision
the
question
should
not
be
decided
by
a
simple
majority
but
by
a
majority
of
at
least
two
thirds
of
both
houses
public
officers
under
the
control
of
the
democracy
of
america
simple
exterior
of
the
american
public
no
official
all
public
officers
are
political
consequences
of
this
no
public
career
exists
in
result
of
this
public
officers
in
the
united
states
are
commingled
with
the
crowd
of
citizens
they
have
neither
palaces
nor
guards
nor
ceremonial
costumes
this
simple
exterior
of
the
persons
in
authority
is
connected
not
only
with
the
peculiarities
of
the
american
character
but
with
the
fundamental
principles
of
that
society
in
the
estimation
of
the
democracy
a
government
is
not
a
benefit
but
a
necessary
evil
a
certain
degree
of
power
must
be
granted
to
public
officers
for
they
would
be
of
no
use
without
it
but
the
ostensible
semblance
of
authority
is
by
no
means
indispensable
to
the
conduct
of
affairs
and
it
is
needlessly
offensive
to
the
susceptibility
of
the
public
the
public
officers
themselves
are
well
aware
that
they
only
enjoy
the
superiority
over
their
fellow
citizens
which
they
derive
from
their
authority
upon
condition
of
putting
themselves
on
a
level
with
the
whole
community
by
their
manners
a
public
officer
in
the
united
states
is
uniformly
civil
accessible
to
all
the
world
attentive
to
all
requests
and
obliging
in
all
his
replies
i
was
pleased
by
these
characteristics
of
a
democratic
government
and
i
was
struck
by
the
manly
independence
of
the
citizens
who
respect
the
office
more
than
the
officer
and
who
are
less
attached
to
the
emblems
of
authority
than
to
the
man
who
bears
them
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
influence
which
costumes
really
exercise
in
an
age
like
that
in
which
we
live
has
been
a
good
deal
exaggerated
i
never
perceived
that
a
public
officer
in
america
was
the
less
respected
while
he
was
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
because
his
own
merit
was
set
off
by
no
adventitious
signs
on
the
other
hand
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
a
peculiar
dress
contributes
to
the
respect
which
public
characters
ought
to
have
for
their
own
position
at
least
when
they
are
not
otherwise
inclined
to
respect
it
when
a
magistrate
and
in
france
such
instances
are
not
rare
indulges
his
trivial
wit
at
the
expense
of
a
prisoner
or
derides
a
predicament
in
which
a
culprit
is
placed
it
would
be
well
to
deprive
him
of
his
robes
of
office
to
see
whether
he
would
recall
some
portion
of
the
natural
dignity
of
mankind
when
he
is
reduced
to
the
apparel
of
a
private
citizen
a
democracy
may
however
allow
a
certain
show
of
magisterial
pomp
and
clothe
its
officers
in
silks
and
gold
without
seriously
compromising
its
principles
privileges
of
this
kind
are
transitory
they
belong
to
the
place
and
are
distinct
from
the
individual
but
if
public
officers
are
not
uniformly
remunerated
by
the
state
the
public
charges
must
be
intrusted
to
men
of
opulence
and
independence
who
constitute
the
basis
of
an
aristocracy
and
if
the
people
still
retains
its
right
of
election
that
election
can
only
be
made
from
a
certain
class
of
citizens
when
a
democratic
republic
renders
offices
which
had
formerly
been
remunerated
gratuitous
it
may
safely
be
believed
that
that
state
is
advancing
to
monarchical
institutions
and
when
a
monarchy
begins
to
remunerate
such
officers
as
had
hitherto
been
unpaid
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
it
is
approaching
toward
a
despotic
or
a
republican
form
of
government
the
substitution
of
paid
for
unpaid
functionaries
is
of
itself
in
my
opinion
sufficient
to
constitute
a
serious
revolution
i
look
upon
the
entire
absence
of
gratuitous
functionaries
in
america
as
one
of
the
most
prominent
signs
of
the
absolute
dominion
which
democracy
exercises
in
that
country
all
public
services
of
whatsoever
nature
they
may
be
are
paid
so
that
every
one
has
not
merely
a
right
but
also
the
means
of
performing
them
although
in
democratic
states
all
the
citizens
are
qualified
to
occupy
stations
in
the
government
all
are
not
tempted
to
try
for
them
the
number
and
the
capacities
of
the
candidates
are
more
apt
to
restrict
the
choice
of
electors
than
the
conditions
of
the
candidateship
in
nations
in
which
the
principle
of
election
extends
to
every
place
in
the
state
no
political
career
can
properly
speaking
be
said
to
exist
men
are
promoted
as
if
by
chance
to
the
rank
which
they
enjoy
and
they
are
by
no
means
sure
of
retaining
it
the
consequence
is
that
in
tranquil
times
public
functions
offer
but
few
lures
to
ambition
in
the
united
states
the
persons
who
engage
in
the
perplexities
of
political
life
are
individuals
of
very
moderate
pretensions
the
pursuit
of
wealth
generally
diverts
men
of
great
talents
and
of
great
passions
from
the
pursuit
of
power
and
it
very
frequently
happens
that
a
man
does
not
undertake
to
direct
the
fortune
of
the
state
until
he
has
discovered
his
incompetence
to
conduct
his
own
affairs
the
vast
number
of
very
ordinary
men
who
occupy
public
stations
is
quite
as
attributable
to
these
causes
as
to
the
bad
choice
of
the
democracy
in
the
united
states
i
am
not
sure
that
the
people
would
return
the
men
of
superior
abilities
who
might
solicit
its
support
but
it
is
certain
that
men
of
this
description
do
not
come
forward
arbitrary
power
of
magistrates
under
the
rule
of
american
democracy
for
what
reason
the
arbitrary
power
of
magistrates
is
greater
in
absolute
monarchies
and
in
democratic
republics
that
it
is
in
limited
arbitrary
power
of
the
magistrates
in
new
england
in
two
different
kinds
of
government
the
magistrates
exercise
a
considerable
degree
of
arbitrary
power
namely
under
the
absolute
government
of
a
single
individual
and
under
that
of
a
democracy
this
identical
result
proceeds
from
causes
which
are
nearly
analogous
in
despotic
states
the
fortune
of
no
citizen
is
secure
and
public
officers
are
not
more
safe
than
private
individuals
the
sovereign
who
has
under
his
control
the
lives
the
property
and
sometimes
the
honor
of
the
men
whom
he
employs
does
not
scruple
to
allow
them
a
great
latitude
of
action
because
he
is
convinced
that
they
will
not
use
it
to
his
prejudice
in
despotic
states
the
sovereign
is
so
attached
to
the
exercise
of
his
power
that
he
dislikes
the
constraint
even
of
his
own
regulations
and
he
is
well
pleased
that
his
agents
should
follow
a
somewhat
fortuitous
line
of
conduct
provided
he
be
certain
that
their
actions
will
never
counteract
his
desires
in
democracies
as
the
majority
has
every
year
the
right
of
depriving
the
officers
whom
it
has
appointed
of
their
power
it
has
no
reason
to
fear
abuse
of
their
authority
as
the
people
is
always
able
to
signify
its
wishes
to
those
who
conduct
the
government
it
prefers
leaving
them
to
make
their
own
exertions
to
prescribing
an
invariable
rule
of
conduct
which
would
at
once
fetter
their
activity
and
the
popular
authority
it
may
even
be
observed
on
attentive
consideration
that
under
the
rule
of
a
democracy
the
arbitrary
power
of
the
magistrate
must
be
still
greater
than
in
despotic
states
in
the
latter
the
sovereign
has
the
power
of
punishing
all
the
faults
with
which
he
becomes
acquainted
but
it
would
be
vain
for
him
to
hope
to
become
acquainted
with
all
those
which
are
committed
in
the
former
the
sovereign
power
is
not
only
supreme
but
it
is
universally
present
the
american
functionaries
are
in
point
of
fact
much
more
independent
in
the
sphere
of
action
which
the
law
traces
out
for
them
than
any
public
officer
in
europe
very
frequently
the
object
which
they
are
to
accomplish
is
simply
pointed
out
to
them
and
the
choice
of
the
means
is
left
to
their
own
discretion
in
new
england
for
instance
the
selectmen
of
each
township
are
bound
to
draw
up
the
list
of
persons
who
are
to
serve
on
the
jury
the
only
rule
which
is
laid
down
to
guide
them
in
their
choice
is
that
they
are
to
select
citizens
possessing
the
elective
franchise
and
enjoying
a
fair
reputation
in
france
the
lives
and
liberties
of
the
subjects
would
be
thought
to
be
in
danger
if
a
public
officer
of
any
kind
was
intrusted
with
so
formidable
a
right
in
new
england
the
same
magistrates
are
empowered
to
post
the
names
of
habitual
drunkards
in
public
houses
and
to
prohibit
the
inhabitants
of
a
town
from
supplying
them
with
liquor
a
censorial
power
of
this
excessive
kind
would
be
revolting
to
the
population
of
the
most
absolute
monarchies
here
however
it
is
submitted
to
without
difficulty
nowhere
has
so
much
been
left
by
the
law
to
the
arbitrary
determination
of
the
magistrates
as
in
democratic
republics
because
this
arbitrary
power
is
unattended
by
any
alarming
consequences
it
may
even
be
asserted
that
the
freedom
of
the
magistrate
increases
as
the
elective
franchise
is
extended
and
as
the
duration
of
the
time
of
office
is
shortened
hence
arises
the
great
difficulty
which
attends
the
conversion
of
a
democratic
republic
into
a
monarchy
the
magistrate
ceases
to
be
elective
but
he
retains
the
rights
and
the
habits
of
an
elected
officer
which
lead
directly
to
despotism
it
is
only
in
limited
monarchies
that
the
law
which
prescribes
the
sphere
in
which
public
officers
are
to
act
superintends
all
their
measures
the
cause
of
this
may
be
easily
detected
in
limited
monarchies
the
power
is
divided
between
the
king
and
the
people
both
of
whom
are
interested
in
the
stability
of
the
magistrate
the
king
does
not
venture
to
place
the
public
officers
under
the
control
of
the
people
lest
they
should
be
tempted
to
betray
his
interests
on
the
other
hand
the
people
fears
lest
the
magistrates
should
serve
to
oppress
the
liberties
of
the
country
if
they
were
entirely
dependent
upon
the
crown
they
can
not
therefore
be
said
to
depend
on
either
the
one
or
the
other
the
same
cause
which
induces
the
king
and
the
people
to
render
public
officers
independent
suggests
the
necessity
of
such
securities
as
may
prevent
their
independence
from
encroaching
upon
the
authority
of
the
former
and
the
liberties
of
the
latter
they
consequently
agree
as
to
the
necessity
of
restricting
the
functionary
to
a
line
of
conduct
laid
down
beforehand
and
they
are
interested
in
confining
him
by
certain
regulations
which
he
can
not
evade
the
observations
respecting
the
arbitrary
powers
of
magistrates
are
practically
among
the
most
erroneous
in
the
work
the
author
seems
to
have
confounded
the
idea
of
magistrates
being
with
their
being
arbitrary
yet
he
had
just
before
spoken
of
their
dependance
on
popular
election
as
a
reason
why
there
was
no
apprehension
of
the
abuse
of
their
authority
the
independence
then
to
which
he
alludes
must
be
an
immunity
from
responsibility
to
any
other
department
but
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
system
that
all
officers
are
liable
to
criminal
prosecution
whenever
they
act
partially
or
oppressively
from
a
malicious
or
corrupt
motive
see
wendell
reports
that
our
magistrates
are
independent
when
they
do
not
act
partially
or
oppressively
is
very
true
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
is
equally
true
in
every
form
of
government
there
would
seem
therefore
not
to
be
such
a
degree
of
independence
as
necessarily
to
produce
arbitrariness
the
author
supposes
that
magistrates
are
more
arbitrary
in
a
despotism
and
in
a
democracy
than
in
a
limited
monarchy
and
yet
the
limits
of
independence
and
of
responsibility
existing
in
the
united
states
are
borrowed
from
and
identical
with
those
established
in
england
the
most
prominent
instance
of
a
limited
monarchy
see
the
authorities
referred
to
in
the
case
in
wendell
reports
before
quoted
discretion
in
the
execution
of
various
ministerial
duties
and
in
the
awarding
of
punishment
by
judicial
officers
is
indispensable
in
every
system
of
government
from
the
utter
impossibility
of
laying
down
beforehand
a
line
of
conduct
as
the
author
expresses
it
in
such
cases
the
very
instances
of
discretionary
power
to
which
he
refers
and
which
he
considers
exist
in
england
there
the
persons
from
whom
juries
are
to
be
formed
for
the
trial
of
causes
civil
and
criminal
are
selected
by
the
sheriffs
who
are
appointed
by
the
crown
a
power
certainly
more
liable
to
abuse
in
their
hands
than
in
those
of
selectmen
or
other
chosen
annually
by
the
people
the
other
power
referred
to
that
of
posting
the
names
of
habitual
drunkards
and
forbidding
their
being
supplied
with
liquor
is
but
a
reiteration
of
the
principles
contained
in
the
english
statute
of
geo
ch
respecting
idle
and
disorderly
persons
indeed
it
may
be
said
with
great
confidence
that
there
is
not
an
instance
of
discretionary
power
being
vested
in
american
magistrates
which
does
not
find
its
prototype
in
the
english
laws
the
whole
argument
of
the
author
on
this
point
therefore
would
seem
to
instability
of
the
administration
in
the
united
states
in
america
the
public
acts
of
a
community
frequently
leave
fewer
traces
than
the
occurrences
of
a
newspapers
the
only
historical
instability
of
the
administration
prejudicial
to
the
art
of
government
the
authority
which
public
men
possess
in
america
is
so
brief
and
they
are
so
soon
commingled
with
the
population
of
the
country
that
the
acts
of
a
community
frequently
leave
fewer
traces
than
the
occurrences
of
a
private
family
the
public
administration
is
so
to
speak
oral
and
traditionary
but
little
is
committed
to
writing
and
that
little
is
wafted
away
for
ever
like
the
leaves
of
the
sibyl
by
the
smallest
breeze
the
only
historical
remains
in
the
united
states
are
the
newspapers
but
if
a
number
be
wanting
the
chain
of
time
is
broken
and
the
present
is
severed
from
the
past
i
am
convinced
that
in
fifty
years
it
will
be
more
difficult
to
collect
authentic
documents
concerning
the
social
condition
of
the
americans
at
the
present
day
than
it
is
to
find
remains
of
the
administration
of
france
during
the
middle
ages
and
if
the
united
states
were
ever
invaded
by
barbarians
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
the
history
of
other
nations
in
order
to
learn
anything
of
the
people
which
now
inhabits
them
the
instability
of
the
administration
has
penetrated
into
the
habits
of
the
people
it
even
appears
to
suit
the
general
taste
and
no
one
cares
for
what
occurred
before
his
time
no
methodical
system
is
pursued
no
archives
are
formed
and
no
documents
are
brought
together
when
it
would
be
very
easy
to
do
so
where
they
exist
little
store
is
set
upon
them
and
i
have
among
my
papers
several
original
public
documents
which
were
given
to
me
in
answer
to
some
of
my
inquiries
in
america
society
seems
to
live
from
hand
to
mouth
like
an
army
in
the
field
nevertheless
the
art
of
administration
may
undoubtedly
be
ranked
as
a
science
and
no
sciences
can
be
improved
if
the
discoveries
and
observations
of
successive
generations
are
not
connected
together
in
the
order
in
which
they
occur
one
man
in
the
short
space
of
his
life
remarks
a
fact
another
conceives
an
idea
the
former
invents
a
means
of
execution
the
latter
reduces
a
truth
to
a
fixed
proposition
and
mankind
gathers
the
fruits
of
individual
experience
upon
its
way
and
gradually
forms
the
sciences
but
the
persons
who
conduct
the
administration
in
america
can
seldom
afford
any
instruction
to
each
other
and
when
they
assume
the
direction
of
society
they
simply
possess
those
attainments
which
are
most
widely
disseminated
in
the
community
and
no
experience
peculiar
to
themselves
democracy
carried
to
its
farthest
limits
is
therefore
prejudicial
to
the
art
of
government
and
for
this
reason
it
is
better
adapted
to
a
people
already
versed
in
the
conduct
of
an
administration
than
to
a
nation
which
is
uninitiated
in
public
affairs
this
remark
indeed
is
not
exclusively
applicable
to
the
science
of
administration
although
a
democratic
government
is
founded
upon
a
very
simple
and
natural
principle
it
always
presupposes
the
existence
of
a
high
degree
of
culture
and
enlightenment
in
society
at
the
first
glance
it
may
be
imagined
to
belong
to
the
earliest
ages
of
the
world
but
maturer
observation
will
convince
us
that
it
could
only
come
last
in
the
succession
of
human
history
these
remarks
upon
the
instability
of
administration
in
america
are
partly
correct
but
partly
erroneous
it
is
certainly
true
that
our
public
men
are
not
educated
to
the
business
of
government
even
our
diplomatists
are
selected
with
very
little
reference
to
their
experience
in
that
department
but
the
universal
attention
that
is
paid
by
the
intelligent
to
the
measures
of
government
and
to
the
discussions
to
which
they
give
rise
is
in
itself
no
slight
preparation
for
the
ordinary
duties
of
legislation
and
indeed
this
the
author
subsequently
seems
to
admit
as
to
there
being
no
archives
formed
of
public
documents
the
author
is
certainly
mistaken
the
journals
of
congress
the
journals
of
state
legislatures
the
public
documents
transmitted
to
and
originating
in
those
bodies
are
carefully
preserved
and
disseminated
through
the
nation
and
they
furnish
in
themselves
the
materials
of
a
full
and
accurate
history
our
great
defect
doubtless
is
in
the
want
of
statistical
information
excepting
the
annual
reports
of
the
state
of
our
commerce
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
under
law
and
excepting
the
census
which
is
taken
every
ten
years
under
the
authority
of
congress
and
those
taken
by
the
states
we
have
no
official
statistics
it
is
supposed
that
the
author
had
this
species
of
information
in
his
mind
when
he
alluded
to
the
general
deficiency
of
our
charges
levied
by
the
state
under
the
rule
of
the
american
democracy
in
all
communities
citizens
divisible
into
three
habits
of
each
of
these
classes
in
the
direction
of
public
why
public
expenditures
must
tend
to
increase
when
the
people
what
renders
the
extravagance
of
a
democracy
less
to
be
feared
in
public
expenditure
under
a
democracy
before
we
can
affirm
whether
a
democratic
form
of
government
is
economical
or
not
we
must
establish
a
suitable
standard
of
comparison
the
question
would
be
one
of
easy
solution
if
we
were
to
attempt
to
draw
a
parallel
between
a
democratic
republic
and
an
absolute
monarchy
the
public
expenditure
would
be
found
to
be
more
considerable
under
the
former
than
under
the
latter
such
is
the
case
with
all
free
states
compared
to
those
which
are
not
so
it
is
certain
that
despotism
ruins
individuals
by
preventing
them
from
producing
wealth
much
more
than
by
depriving
them
of
the
wealth
they
have
produced
it
dries
up
the
source
of
riches
while
it
usually
respects
acquired
property
freedom
on
the
contrary
engenders
far
more
benefits
than
it
destroys
and
the
nations
which
are
favored
by
free
institutions
invariably
find
that
their
resources
increase
even
more
rapidly
than
their
taxes
my
present
object
is
to
compare
free
nations
to
each
other
and
to
point
out
the
influence
of
democracy
upon
the
finances
of
a
state
communities
as
well
as
organic
bodies
are
subject
to
certain
fixed
rules
in
their
formation
which
they
can
not
evade
they
are
composed
of
certain
elements
which
are
common
to
them
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
the
people
may
always
be
mentally
divided
into
three
distinct
classes
the
first
of
these
classes
consists
of
the
wealthy
the
second
of
those
who
are
in
easy
circumstances
and
the
third
is
composed
of
those
who
have
little
or
no
property
and
who
subsist
more
especially
by
the
work
which
they
perform
for
the
two
superior
orders
the
proportion
of
the
individuals
who
are
included
in
these
three
divisions
may
vary
according
to
the
condition
of
society
but
the
divisions
themselves
can
never
be
obliterated
it
is
evident
that
each
of
these
classes
will
exercise
an
influence
peculiar
to
its
own
propensities
upon
the
administration
of
the
finances
of
the
state
if
the
first
of
the
three
exclusively
possess
the
legislative
power
it
is
probable
that
it
will
not
be
sparing
of
the
public
funds
because
the
taxes
which
are
levied
on
a
large
fortune
only
tend
to
diminish
the
sum
of
superfluous
enjoyment
and
are
in
point
of
fact
but
little
felt
if
the
second
class
has
the
power
of
making
the
laws
it
will
certainly
not
be
lavish
of
taxes
because
nothing
is
so
onerous
as
a
large
impost
which
is
levied
upon
a
small
income
the
government
of
the
middle
classes
appears
to
me
to
be
the
most
economical
though
perhaps
not
the
most
enlightened
and
certainly
not
the
most
generous
of
free
governments
but
let
us
now
suppose
that
the
legislative
authority
is
vested
in
the
lowest
orders
there
are
two
striking
reasons
which
show
that
the
tendency
of
the
expenditure
will
be
to
increase
not
to
diminish
as
the
great
majority
of
those
who
create
the
laws
are
possessed
of
no
property
upon
which
taxes
can
be
imposed
all
the
money
which
is
spent
for
the
community
appears
to
be
spent
to
their
advantage
at
no
cost
of
their
own
and
those
who
are
possessed
of
some
little
property
readily
find
means
of
regulating
the
taxes
so
that
they
are
burthensome
to
the
wealthy
and
profitable
to
the
poor
although
the
rich
are
unable
to
take
the
same
advantage
when
they
are
in
possession
of
the
government
in
countries
in
which
the
poor
should
be
exclusively
invested
with
the
power
of
making
the
laws
no
great
economy
of
public
expenditure
ought
to
be
expected
that
expenditure
will
always
be
considerable
either
because
the
taxes
do
not
weigh
upon
those
who
levy
them
or
because
they
are
levied
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
weigh
upon
those
classes
in
other
words
the
government
of
the
democracy
is
the
only
one
under
which
the
power
which
lays
on
taxes
escapes
the
payment
of
them
it
may
be
objected
but
the
argument
has
no
real
weight
that
the
true
interest
of
the
people
is
indissolubly
connected
with
that
of
the
wealthier
portion
of
the
community
since
it
can
not
but
suffer
by
the
severe
measures
to
which
it
resorts
but
is
it
not
the
true
interest
of
kings
to
render
their
subjects
happy
and
the
true
interest
of
nobles
to
admit
recruits
into
their
order
on
suitable
grounds
if
remote
advantages
had
power
to
prevail
over
the
passions
and
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
no
such
thing
as
a
tyrannical
sovereign
or
an
exclusive
aristocracy
could
ever
exist
again
it
may
be
objected
that
the
poor
are
never
invested
with
the
sole
power
of
making
the
laws
but
i
reply
that
wherever
universal
suffrage
has
been
established
the
majority
of
the
community
unquestionably
exercises
the
legislative
authority
and
if
it
be
proved
that
the
poor
always
constitute
the
majority
it
may
be
added
with
perfect
truth
that
in
the
countries
in
which
they
possess
the
elective
franchise
they
possess
the
sole
power
of
making
laws
but
it
is
certain
that
in
all
the
nations
of
the
world
the
greater
number
has
always
consisted
of
those
persons
who
hold
no
property
or
of
those
whose
property
is
insufficient
to
exempt
them
from
the
necessity
of
working
in
order
to
procure
an
easy
subsistence
universal
suffrage
does
therefore
in
point
of
fact
invest
the
poor
with
the
government
of
society
the
disastrous
influence
which
popular
authority
may
sometimes
exercise
upon
the
finances
of
a
state
was
very
clearly
seen
in
some
of
the
democratic
republics
of
antiquity
in
which
the
public
treasure
was
exhausted
in
order
to
relieve
indigent
citizens
or
to
supply
the
games
and
theatrical
amusements
of
the
populace
it
is
true
that
the
representative
system
was
then
very
imperfectly
known
and
that
at
the
present
time
the
influence
of
popular
passions
is
less
felt
in
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
but
it
may
be
believed
that
the
delegate
will
in
the
end
conform
to
the
principles
of
his
constituents
and
favor
their
propensities
as
much
as
their
interests
the
extravagance
of
democracy
is
however
less
to
be
dreaded
in
proportion
as
the
people
acquires
a
share
of
property
because
on
the
one
hand
the
contributions
of
the
rich
are
then
less
needed
and
on
the
other
it
is
more
difficult
to
lay
on
taxes
which
do
not
affect
the
interests
of
the
lower
classes
on
this
account
universal
suffrage
would
be
less
dangerous
in
france
than
in
england
because
in
the
latter
country
the
property
on
which
taxes
may
be
levied
is
vested
in
fewer
hands
america
where
the
great
majority
of
the
citizens
is
possessed
of
some
fortune
is
in
a
still
more
favorable
position
than
france
there
are
still
farther
causes
which
may
increase
the
sum
of
public
expenditures
in
democratic
countries
when
the
aristocracy
governs
the
individuals
who
conduct
the
affairs
of
state
are
exempted
by
their
own
station
in
society
from
every
kind
of
privation
they
are
contented
with
their
position
power
and
renown
are
the
objects
for
which
they
strive
and
as
they
are
placed
far
above
the
obscurer
throng
of
citizens
they
do
not
always
distinctly
perceive
how
the
wellbeing
of
the
mass
of
the
people
ought
to
redound
to
their
own
honor
they
are
not
indeed
callous
to
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
but
they
can
not
feel
those
miseries
as
acutely
as
if
they
were
themselves
partakers
of
them
provided
that
the
people
appear
to
submit
to
its
lot
the
rulers
are
satisfied
and
they
demand
nothing
farther
from
the
government
an
aristocracy
is
more
intent
upon
the
means
of
maintaining
its
influence
than
upon
the
means
of
improving
its
condition
when
on
the
contrary
the
people
is
invested
with
the
supreme
authority
the
perpetual
sense
of
their
own
miseries
impels
the
rulers
of
society
to
seek
for
perpetual
meliorations
a
thousand
different
objects
are
subjected
to
improvement
the
most
trivial
details
are
sought
out
as
susceptible
of
amendment
and
those
changes
which
are
accompanied
with
considerable
expense
are
more
especially
advocated
since
the
object
is
to
render
the
condition
of
the
poor
more
tolerable
who
can
not
pay
for
themselves
moreover
all
democratic
communities
are
agitated
by
an
excitement
and
by
a
kind
of
feverish
impatience
that
engenders
a
multitude
of
innovations
almost
all
of
which
are
attended
with
expense
in
monarchies
and
aristocracies
the
natural
taste
which
the
rulers
have
for
power
and
for
renown
is
stimulated
by
the
promptings
of
ambition
and
they
are
frequently
incited
by
these
temptations
to
very
costly
undertakings
in
democracies
where
the
rulers
labor
under
privations
they
can
only
be
courted
by
such
means
as
improve
their
wellbeing
and
these
improvements
can
not
take
place
without
a
sacrifice
of
money
when
a
people
begins
to
reflect
upon
its
situation
it
discovers
a
multitude
of
wants
to
which
it
had
not
before
been
subject
and
to
satisfy
these
exigencies
recourse
must
be
had
to
the
coffers
of
the
state
hence
it
arises
that
the
public
charges
increase
in
proportion
as
civilisation
spreads
and
that
the
imposts
are
augmented
as
knowledge
pervades
the
community
the
last
cause
which
frequently
renders
a
democratic
government
dearer
than
any
other
is
that
a
democracy
does
not
always
succeed
in
moderating
its
expenditure
because
it
does
not
understand
the
art
of
being
economical
as
the
designs
which
it
entertains
are
frequently
changed
and
the
agents
of
those
designs
are
more
frequently
removed
its
undertakings
are
often
or
left
unfinished
in
the
former
case
the
state
spends
sums
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
end
which
it
proposes
to
accomplish
in
the
second
the
expense
itself
is
unprofitable
tendencies
of
the
american
democracy
as
regards
the
salaries
of
public
officers
in
democracies
those
who
establish
high
salaries
have
no
chance
of
profiting
by
tendency
of
the
american
democracy
to
increase
the
salaries
of
subordinate
officers
and
to
lower
those
of
the
more
important
reason
of
comparative
statement
of
the
salaries
of
public
officers
in
the
united
states
and
in
france
there
is
a
powerful
reason
which
usually
induces
democracies
to
economise
upon
the
salaries
of
public
officers
as
the
number
of
citizens
who
dispense
the
remuneration
is
extremely
large
in
democratic
countries
so
the
number
of
persons
who
can
hope
to
be
benefited
by
the
receipt
of
it
is
comparatively
small
in
aristocratic
countries
on
the
contrary
the
individuals
who
appoint
high
salaries
have
almost
always
a
vague
hope
of
profiting
by
them
these
appointments
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
capital
which
they
create
for
their
own
use
or
at
least
as
a
resource
for
their
children
it
must
however
be
allowed
that
a
democratic
state
is
most
parsimonious
toward
its
principal
agents
in
america
the
secondary
officers
are
much
better
paid
and
the
dignitaries
of
the
administration
much
worse
than
they
are
elsewhere
these
opposite
effects
result
from
the
same
cause
the
people
fixes
the
salaries
of
the
public
officers
in
both
cases
and
the
scale
of
remuneration
is
determined
by
the
consideration
of
its
own
wants
it
is
held
to
be
fair
that
the
servants
of
the
public
should
be
placed
in
the
same
easy
circumstances
as
the
public
itself
but
when
the
question
turns
upon
the
salaries
of
the
great
officers
of
state
this
rule
fails
and
chance
alone
can
guide
the
popular
decision
the
poor
have
no
adequate
conceptions
of
the
wants
which
the
higher
classes
of
society
may
feel
the
sum
which
is
scanty
to
the
rich
appears
enormous
to
the
poor
man
whose
wants
do
not
extend
beyond
the
necessaries
of
life
and
in
his
estimation
the
governor
of
a
state
with
his
two
or
three
hundred
a
year
is
a
very
fortunate
and
enviable
being
if
you
undertake
to
convince
him
that
the
representative
of
a
great
people
ought
to
be
able
to
maintain
some
show
of
splendor
in
the
eyes
of
foreign
nations
he
will
perhaps
assent
to
your
meaning
but
when
he
reflects
on
his
own
humble
dwelling
and
on
the
produce
of
his
wearisome
toil
he
remembers
all
that
he
could
do
with
a
salary
which
you
say
is
insufficient
and
he
is
startled
or
almost
frightened
at
the
sight
of
such
uncommon
wealth
besides
the
secondary
public
officer
is
almost
on
a
level
with
the
people
while
the
others
are
raised
above
it
the
former
may
therefore
excite
his
interest
but
the
latter
begins
to
arouse
his
envy
this
is
very
clearly
seen
in
the
united
states
where
the
salaries
seem
to
decrease
as
the
authority
of
those
who
receive
them
augments
under
the
rule
of
an
aristocracy
it
frequently
happens
on
the
contrary
that
while
the
high
officers
are
receiving
munificent
salaries
the
inferior
ones
have
not
more
than
enough
to
procure
the
necessaries
of
life
the
reason
of
this
fact
is
easily
discoverable
from
causes
very
analogous
to
those
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
if
a
democracy
is
unable
to
conceive
the
pleasures
of
the
rich
or
to
see
them
without
envy
an
aristocracy
is
slow
to
understand
or
to
speak
more
correctly
is
unacquainted
with
the
privations
of
the
poor
the
poor
man
is
not
if
we
use
the
term
aright
the
fellow
of
the
rich
one
but
he
is
the
being
of
another
species
an
aristocracy
is
therefore
apt
to
care
but
little
for
the
fate
of
its
subordinate
agents
and
their
salaries
are
only
raised
when
they
refuse
to
perform
their
service
for
too
scanty
a
remuneration
it
is
the
parsimonious
conduct
of
democracy
toward
its
principal
officers
which
has
countenanced
a
supposition
of
far
more
economical
propensities
than
any
which
it
really
possesses
it
is
true
that
it
scarcely
allows
the
means
of
honorable
subsistence
to
the
individuals
who
conduct
its
affairs
but
enormous
sums
are
lavished
to
meet
the
exigencies
or
to
facilitate
the
enjoyments
of
the
people
the
money
raised
by
taxation
may
be
better
employed
but
it
is
not
saved
in
general
democracy
gives
largely
to
the
community
and
very
sparingly
to
those
who
govern
it
the
reverse
is
the
case
in
the
aristocratic
countries
where
the
money
of
the
state
is
expended
to
the
profit
of
the
persons
who
are
at
the
head
of
affairs
difficulty
of
distinguishing
the
causes
which
contribute
to
the
economy
of
the
american
government
we
are
liable
to
frequent
errors
in
the
research
of
those
facts
which
exercise
a
serious
influence
upon
the
fate
of
mankind
since
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
appreciate
their
real
value
one
people
is
naturally
inconsistent
and
enthusiastic
another
is
sober
and
calculating
and
these
characteristics
originate
in
their
physical
constitution
or
in
remote
causes
with
which
we
are
unacquainted
there
are
nations
which
are
fond
of
parade
and
the
bustle
of
festivity
and
which
do
not
regret
the
costly
gaieties
of
an
hour
others
on
the
contrary
are
attached
to
more
retiring
pleasures
and
seem
almost
ashamed
of
appearing
to
be
pleased
in
some
countries
the
highest
value
is
set
upon
the
beauty
of
public
edifices
in
others
the
productions
of
art
are
treated
with
indifference
and
everything
which
is
unproductive
is
looked
down
upon
with
contempt
in
some
renown
in
others
money
is
the
ruling
passion
independently
of
the
laws
all
these
causes
concur
to
exercise
a
very
powerful
influence
upon
the
conduct
of
the
finances
of
the
state
if
the
americans
never
spend
the
money
of
the
people
in
galas
it
is
not
only
because
the
imposition
of
taxes
is
under
the
control
of
the
people
but
because
the
people
takes
no
delight
in
public
rejoicings
if
they
repudiate
all
ornament
from
their
architecture
and
set
no
store
on
any
but
the
more
practical
and
homely
advantages
it
is
not
only
because
they
live
under
democratic
institutions
but
because
they
are
a
commercial
nation
the
habits
of
private
life
are
continued
in
public
and
we
ought
carefully
to
distinguish
that
economy
which
depends
upon
their
institutions
from
that
which
is
the
natural
result
of
their
manners
and
customs
whether
the
expenditure
of
the
united
states
can
be
compared
to
that
of
france
two
points
to
be
established
in
order
to
estimate
the
extent
of
the
public
charges
viz
the
national
wealth
and
the
rate
of
the
wealth
and
the
charges
of
france
not
accurately
why
the
wealth
and
charges
of
the
union
can
not
be
accurately
researches
of
the
author
with
a
view
to
discover
the
amount
of
taxation
in
general
symptoms
which
may
serve
to
indicate
the
amount
of
the
public
charges
in
a
given
result
of
this
investigation
for
the
union
many
attempts
have
recently
been
made
in
france
to
compare
the
public
expenditure
of
that
country
with
the
expenditure
of
the
united
states
all
these
attempts
have
however
been
unattended
by
success
and
a
few
words
will
suffice
to
show
that
they
could
not
have
had
a
satisfactory
result
in
order
to
estimate
the
amount
of
the
public
charges
of
a
people
two
preliminaries
are
indispensable
it
is
necessary
in
the
first
place
to
know
the
wealth
of
that
people
and
in
the
second
to
learn
what
portion
of
that
wealth
is
devoted
to
the
expenditure
of
the
state
to
show
the
amount
of
taxation
without
showing
the
resources
which
are
destined
to
meet
the
demand
is
to
undertake
a
futile
labor
for
it
is
not
the
expenditure
but
the
relation
of
the
expenditure
to
the
revenue
which
it
is
desirable
to
know
the
same
rate
of
taxation
which
may
easily
be
supported
by
a
wealthy
contributor
will
reduce
a
poor
one
to
extreme
misery
the
wealth
of
nations
is
composed
of
several
distinct
elements
of
which
population
is
the
first
real
property
the
second
and
personal
property
the
third
the
first
of
these
three
elements
may
be
discovered
without
difficulty
among
civilized
nations
it
is
easy
to
obtain
an
accurate
census
of
the
inhabitants
but
the
two
others
can
not
be
determined
with
so
much
facility
it
is
difficult
to
take
an
exact
account
of
all
the
lands
in
a
country
which
are
under
cultivation
with
their
natural
or
their
acquired
value
and
it
is
still
more
impossible
to
estimate
the
entire
personal
property
which
is
at
the
disposal
of
the
nation
and
which
eludes
the
strictest
analysis
by
the
diversity
and
number
of
shapes
under
which
it
may
occur
and
indeed
we
find
that
the
most
ancient
civilized
nations
of
europe
including
even
those
in
which
the
administration
is
most
central
have
not
succeeded
as
yet
in
determining
the
exact
condition
of
their
wealth
in
america
the
attempt
has
never
been
made
for
how
would
such
an
investigation
be
possible
in
a
country
where
society
has
not
yet
settled
into
habits
of
regularity
and
tranquillity
where
the
national
government
is
not
assisted
by
a
multitude
of
agents
whose
exertions
it
can
command
and
direct
to
one
sole
end
and
where
statistics
are
not
studied
because
no
one
is
able
to
collect
the
necessary
documents
or
can
find
time
to
peruse
them
thus
the
primary
elements
of
the
calculations
which
have
been
made
in
france
can
not
be
obtained
in
the
union
the
relative
wealth
of
the
two
countries
is
unknown
the
property
of
the
former
is
not
accurately
determined
and
no
means
exist
of
computing
that
of
the
latter
i
consent
therefore
for
the
sake
of
the
discussion
to
abandon
this
necessary
term
of
the
comparison
and
i
confine
myself
to
a
computation
of
the
actual
amount
of
taxation
without
investigating
the
relation
which
subsists
between
the
taxation
and
the
revenue
but
the
reader
will
perceive
that
my
task
has
not
been
facilitated
by
the
limits
which
i
here
lay
down
for
my
researches
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
central
administration
of
france
assisted
by
all
the
public
officers
who
are
at
its
disposal
might
determine
with
exactitude
the
amount
of
the
direct
and
indirect
taxes
levied
upon
the
citizens
but
this
investigation
which
no
private
individual
can
undertake
has
not
hitherto
been
completed
by
the
french
government
or
at
least
its
results
have
not
been
made
public
we
are
acquainted
with
the
sum
total
of
the
state
we
know
the
amount
of
the
departmental
expenditure
but
the
expenses
of
the
communal
divisions
have
not
been
computed
and
the
amount
of
the
public
expenses
of
france
is
unknown
if
we
now
turn
to
america
we
shall
perceive
that
the
difficulties
are
multiplied
and
enhanced
the
union
publishes
an
exact
return
of
the
amount
of
its
expenditure
the
budgets
of
the
states
furnish
similar
returns
of
their
revenues
but
the
expenses
incident
to
the
affairs
of
the
counties
and
the
townships
are
unknown
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
can
not
oblige
the
provincial
governments
to
throw
any
light
upon
this
point
and
even
if
these
governments
were
inclined
to
afford
their
simultaneous
it
may
be
doubted
whether
they
possess
the
means
of
procuring
a
satisfactory
answer
independently
of
the
natural
difficulties
of
the
task
the
political
organization
of
the
country
would
act
as
a
hindrance
to
the
success
of
their
efforts
the
county
and
town
magistrates
are
not
appointed
by
the
authorities
of
the
state
and
they
are
not
subjected
to
their
control
it
is
therefore
very
allowable
to
suppose
that
if
the
state
was
desirous
of
obtaining
the
returns
which
we
require
its
designs
would
be
counteracted
by
the
neglect
of
those
subordinate
officers
whom
it
would
be
obliged
to
employ
it
is
in
point
of
fact
useless
to
inquire
what
the
americans
might
do
to
forward
this
inquiry
since
it
is
certain
that
they
have
hitherto
done
nothing
at
all
there
does
not
exist
a
single
individual
at
the
present
day
in
america
or
in
europe
who
can
inform
us
what
each
citizen
of
the
union
annually
contributes
to
the
public
charges
of
the
nation
if
i
attempt
to
compare
the
french
budget
with
the
budget
of
the
union
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
latter
embraces
much
fewer
objects
than
the
central
government
of
the
former
country
and
that
the
expenditure
must
consequently
be
much
smaller
if
i
contrast
the
budgets
of
the
departments
to
those
of
the
states
which
constitute
the
union
it
must
be
observed
that
as
the
power
and
control
exercised
by
the
states
is
much
greater
than
that
which
is
exercised
by
the
departments
their
expenditure
is
also
more
considerable
as
for
the
budgets
of
the
counties
nothing
of
the
kind
occurs
in
the
french
system
of
finance
and
it
is
again
doubtful
whether
the
corresponding
expenses
should
be
referred
to
the
budget
of
the
state
or
to
those
of
the
municipal
divisions
municipal
expenses
exist
in
both
countries
but
they
are
not
always
analogous
in
america
the
townships
discharge
a
variety
of
offices
which
are
reserved
in
france
to
the
departments
or
the
state
it
may
moreover
be
asked
what
is
to
be
understood
by
the
municipal
expenses
of
america
the
organization
of
the
municipal
bodies
or
townships
differs
in
the
several
states
are
we
to
be
guided
by
what
occurs
in
new
england
or
in
georgia
in
pennsylvania
or
the
state
of
illinois
a
kind
of
analogy
may
very
readily
be
perceived
between
certain
budgets
in
the
two
countries
but
as
the
elements
of
which
they
are
composed
always
differ
more
or
less
no
fair
comparison
can
be
instituted
between
them
hence
we
must
conclude
that
it
is
no
less
difficult
to
compare
the
social
expenditure
than
it
is
to
estimate
the
relative
wealth
of
france
and
of
america
i
will
even
add
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
attempt
this
comparison
for
when
statistics
are
not
founded
upon
computations
which
are
strictly
accurate
they
mislead
instead
of
guiding
aright
the
mind
is
easily
imposed
upon
by
the
false
affectation
of
exactitude
which
prevails
even
in
the
of
the
science
and
adopts
with
confidence
the
errors
which
are
apparelled
in
the
forms
of
mathematical
truth
we
abandon
therefore
our
numerical
investigation
with
the
hope
of
meeting
with
data
of
another
kind
in
the
absence
of
positive
documents
we
may
form
an
opinion
as
to
the
proportion
which
the
taxation
of
a
people
bears
to
its
real
prosperity
by
observing
whether
its
external
appearance
is
flourishing
whether
after
having
discharged
the
calls
of
the
state
the
poor
man
retains
the
means
of
subsistence
and
the
rich
the
means
of
enjoyment
and
whether
both
classes
are
contented
with
their
position
seeking
however
to
meliorate
it
by
perpetual
exertions
so
that
industry
is
never
in
want
of
capital
nor
capital
unemployed
by
industry
the
observer
who
draws
his
inferences
from
these
signs
will
undoubtedly
be
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
american
of
the
united
states
contributes
a
much
smaller
portion
of
his
income
to
the
state
than
the
citizen
of
france
nor
indeed
can
the
result
be
otherwise
a
portion
of
the
french
debt
is
the
consequence
of
two
successive
invasions
and
the
union
has
no
similar
calamity
to
fear
a
nation
placed
upon
the
continent
of
europe
is
obliged
to
maintain
a
large
standing
army
the
isolated
position
of
the
union
enables
it
to
have
only
soldiers
the
french
have
a
fleet
of
sail
the
americans
have
vessels
how
then
can
the
inhabitant
of
the
union
be
called
upon
to
contribute
as
largely
as
the
inhabitant
of
france
no
parallel
can
be
drawn
between
the
finances
of
two
countries
so
differently
situated
it
is
by
examining
what
actually
takes
place
in
the
union
and
not
by
comparing
the
union
with
france
that
we
may
discover
whether
the
american
government
is
really
economical
on
casting
my
eyes
over
the
different
republics
which
form
the
confederation
i
perceive
that
their
governments
lack
perseverance
in
their
undertakings
and
that
they
exercise
no
steady
control
over
the
men
whom
they
employ
whence
i
naturally
infer
that
they
must
often
spend
the
money
of
the
people
to
no
purpose
or
consume
more
of
it
than
is
really
necessary
to
their
undertakings
great
efforts
are
made
in
accordance
with
the
democratic
origin
of
society
to
satisfy
the
exigencies
of
the
lower
orders
to
open
the
career
of
power
to
their
endeavors
and
to
diffuse
knowledge
and
comfort
among
them
the
poor
are
maintained
immense
sums
are
annually
devoted
to
public
instruction
all
services
whatsoever
are
remunerated
and
the
most
subordinate
agents
are
liberally
paid
if
this
kind
of
government
appears
to
me
to
be
useful
and
rational
i
am
nevertheless
constrained
to
admit
that
it
is
expensive
wherever
the
poor
direct
public
affairs
and
dispose
of
the
national
resources
it
appears
certain
that
as
they
profit
by
the
expenditure
of
the
state
they
are
apt
to
augment
that
expenditure
i
conclude
therefore
without
having
recourse
to
inaccurate
computations
and
without
hazarding
a
comparison
which
might
prove
incorrect
that
the
democratic
government
of
the
americans
is
not
a
cheap
government
as
is
sometimes
asserted
and
i
have
no
hesitation
in
predicting
that
if
the
people
of
the
united
states
is
ever
involved
in
serious
difficulties
its
taxation
will
speedily
be
increased
to
the
rate
of
that
which
prevails
in
the
greater
part
of
the
aristocracies
and
the
monarchies
of
europe
corruption
and
vices
of
the
rulers
in
a
democracy
and
consequent
effects
upon
public
morality
in
aristocracies
rulers
sometimes
endeavor
to
corrupt
the
in
democracies
rulers
frequently
show
themselves
to
be
in
the
former
their
vices
are
directly
prejudicial
to
the
morality
of
the
in
the
latter
their
indirect
influence
is
still
more
pernicious
a
distinction
must
be
made
when
the
aristocratic
and
the
democratic
principles
mutually
inveigh
against
each
other
as
tending
to
facilitate
corruption
in
aristocratic
governments
the
individuals
who
are
placed
at
the
head
of
affairs
are
rich
men
who
are
solely
desirous
of
power
in
democracies
statesmen
are
poor
and
they
have
their
fortunes
to
make
the
consequence
is
that
in
aristocratic
states
the
rulers
are
rarely
accessible
to
corruption
and
have
very
little
craving
for
money
while
the
reverse
is
the
case
in
democratic
nations
but
in
aristocracies
as
those
who
are
desirous
of
arriving
at
the
head
of
affairs
are
possessed
of
considerable
wealth
and
as
the
number
of
persons
by
whose
assistance
they
may
rise
is
comparatively
small
the
government
is
if
i
may
use
the
expression
put
up
to
a
sort
of
auction
in
democracies
on
the
contrary
those
who
are
covetous
of
power
are
very
seldom
wealthy
and
the
number
of
citizens
who
confer
that
power
is
extremely
great
perhaps
in
democracies
the
number
of
men
who
might
be
bought
is
by
no
means
smaller
but
buyers
are
rarely
to
be
met
with
and
besides
it
would
be
necessary
to
buy
so
many
persons
at
once
that
the
attempt
is
rendered
nugatory
many
of
the
men
who
have
been
in
the
administration
in
france
during
the
last
forty
years
have
been
accused
of
making
their
fortunes
at
the
expense
of
the
state
or
of
its
allies
a
reproach
which
was
rarely
addressed
to
the
public
characters
of
the
ancient
monarchy
but
in
france
the
practice
of
bribing
electors
is
almost
unknown
while
it
is
notoriously
and
publicly
carried
on
in
england
in
the
united
states
i
never
heard
a
man
accused
of
spending
his
wealth
in
corrupting
the
populace
but
i
have
often
heard
the
probity
of
public
officers
questioned
still
more
frequently
have
i
heard
their
success
attributed
to
low
intrigues
and
immoral
practices
if
then
the
men
who
conduct
the
government
of
an
aristocracy
sometimes
endeavor
to
corrupt
the
people
the
heads
of
a
democracy
are
themselves
corrupt
in
the
former
case
the
morality
of
the
people
is
directly
assailed
in
the
latter
an
indirect
influence
is
exercised
upon
the
people
which
is
still
more
to
be
dreaded
as
the
rulers
of
democratic
nations
are
almost
always
exposed
to
the
suspicion
of
dishonorable
conduct
they
in
some
measure
lend
the
authority
of
the
government
to
the
base
practices
of
which
they
are
accused
they
thus
afford
an
example
which
must
prove
discouraging
to
the
struggles
of
virtuous
independence
and
must
foster
the
secret
calculations
of
a
vicious
ambition
if
it
be
asserted
that
evil
passions
are
displayed
in
all
ranks
of
society
that
they
ascend
the
throne
by
hereditary
right
and
that
despicable
characters
are
to
be
met
with
at
the
head
of
aristocratic
nations
as
well
as
in
the
sphere
of
a
democracy
this
objection
has
but
little
weight
in
my
estimation
the
corruption
of
men
who
have
casually
risen
to
power
has
a
coarse
and
vulgar
infection
in
it
which
renders
it
contagious
to
the
multitude
on
the
contrary
there
is
a
kind
of
aristocratic
refinement
and
an
air
of
grandeur
in
the
depravity
of
the
great
which
frequently
prevents
it
from
spreading
abroad
the
people
can
never
penetrate
the
perplexing
labyrinth
of
court
intrigue
and
it
will
always
have
difficulty
in
detecting
the
turpitude
which
lurks
under
elegant
manners
refined
tastes
and
graceful
language
but
to
pillage
the
public
purse
and
to
vend
the
favors
of
the
state
are
arts
which
the
meanest
villain
may
comprehend
and
hope
to
practise
in
his
turn
in
reality
it
is
far
less
prejudicial
to
be
a
witness
to
the
immorality
of
the
great
than
to
that
immorality
which
leads
to
greatness
in
a
democracy
private
citizens
see
a
man
of
their
own
rank
in
life
who
rises
from
that
obscure
position
and
who
becomes
possessed
of
riches
and
of
power
in
a
few
years
the
spectacle
excites
their
surprise
and
their
envy
and
they
are
led
to
inquire
how
the
person
who
was
yesterday
their
equal
is
their
ruler
to
attribute
his
rise
to
his
talents
or
his
virtues
is
unpleasant
for
it
is
tacitly
to
acknowledge
that
they
are
themselves
less
virtuous
and
less
talented
than
he
was
they
are
therefore
led
and
not
unfrequently
their
conjecture
is
a
correct
one
to
impute
his
success
mainly
to
some
of
his
defects
and
an
odious
mixture
is
thus
formed
of
the
ideas
of
turpitude
and
power
unworthiness
and
success
utility
and
dishonor
efforts
of
which
a
democracy
is
capable
the
union
has
only
had
one
struggle
hitherto
for
its
enthusiasm
at
the
commencement
of
the
indifference
toward
its
difficulty
of
establishing
a
military
conscription
or
impressment
of
seamen
in
why
a
democratic
people
is
less
capable
of
sustained
effort
than
another
i
here
warn
the
reader
that
i
speak
of
a
government
which
implicitly
follows
the
real
desires
of
the
people
and
not
of
a
government
which
simply
commands
in
its
name
nothing
is
so
irresistible
as
a
tyrannical
power
commanding
in
the
name
of
the
people
because
while
it
exercises
that
moral
influence
which
belongs
to
the
decisions
of
the
majority
it
acts
at
the
same
time
with
the
promptitude
and
the
tenacity
of
a
single
man
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
degree
of
exertion
a
democratic
government
may
be
capable
of
making
at
a
crisis
in
the
history
of
the
nation
but
no
great
democratic
republic
has
hitherto
existed
in
the
world
to
style
the
oligarchy
which
ruled
over
france
in
by
that
name
would
be
to
offer
an
insult
to
the
republican
form
of
government
the
united
states
afford
the
first
example
of
the
kind
the
american
union
has
now
subsisted
for
half
a
century
in
the
course
of
which
time
its
existence
has
only
once
been
attacked
namely
during
the
war
of
independence
at
the
commencement
of
that
long
war
various
occurrences
took
place
which
betokened
an
extraordinary
zeal
for
the
service
of
the
country
but
as
the
contest
was
prolonged
symptoms
of
private
egotism
began
to
show
themselves
no
money
was
poured
into
the
public
treasury
few
recruits
could
be
raised
to
join
the
army
the
people
wished
to
acquire
independence
but
was
very
ill
disposed
to
undergo
the
privations
by
which
alone
it
could
be
obtained
tax
laws
says
hamilton
in
the
federalist
no
have
in
vain
been
multiplied
new
methods
to
enforce
the
collection
have
in
vain
been
tried
the
public
expectation
has
been
uniformly
disappointed
and
the
treasuries
of
the
states
have
remained
empty
the
popular
system
of
administration
inherent
in
the
nature
of
popular
government
coinciding
with
the
real
scarcity
of
money
incident
to
a
languid
and
mutilated
state
of
trade
has
hitherto
defeated
every
experiment
for
extensive
collections
and
has
at
length
taught
the
different
legislatures
the
folly
of
attempting
them
the
united
states
have
not
had
any
serious
war
to
carry
on
since
that
period
in
order
therefore
to
appreciate
the
sacrifices
which
democratic
nations
may
impose
upon
themselves
we
must
wait
until
the
american
people
is
obliged
to
put
half
its
entire
income
at
the
disposal
of
the
government
as
was
done
by
the
english
or
until
it
sends
forth
a
twentieth
part
of
its
population
to
the
field
of
battle
as
was
done
by
france
in
america
the
use
of
conscription
is
unknown
and
men
are
induced
to
enlist
by
bounties
the
notions
and
habits
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
so
opposed
to
compulsory
enlistments
that
i
do
not
imagine
that
it
can
ever
be
sanctioned
by
the
laws
what
is
termed
the
conscription
in
france
is
assuredly
the
heaviest
tax
upon
the
population
of
that
country
yet
how
could
a
great
continental
war
be
carried
on
without
it
the
americans
have
not
adopted
the
british
impressment
of
seamen
and
they
have
nothing
which
corresponds
to
the
french
system
of
maritime
conscription
the
navy
as
well
as
the
merchant
service
is
supplied
by
voluntary
engagement
but
it
is
not
easy
to
conceive
how
a
people
can
sustain
a
great
maritime
war
without
having
recourse
to
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
systems
indeed
the
union
which
has
fought
with
some
honor
upon
the
seas
has
never
possessed
a
very
numerous
fleet
and
the
equipment
of
the
small
number
of
american
vessels
has
always
been
excessively
expensive
the
remark
that
in
america
the
use
of
conscription
is
unknown
and
men
are
induced
to
enlist
by
bounties
is
not
exactly
correct
during
the
last
war
with
great
britain
the
state
of
new
york
in
october
see
the
laws
of
that
session
passed
an
act
to
raise
troops
for
the
defence
of
the
state
in
which
the
whole
body
of
the
militia
were
directed
to
be
classed
and
each
class
to
furnish
one
soldier
so
as
to
make
up
the
whole
number
of
directed
to
be
raised
in
case
of
the
refusal
of
a
class
to
furnish
a
man
one
was
to
be
detached
from
them
by
ballot
and
was
compelled
to
procure
a
substitute
or
serve
personally
the
intervention
of
peace
rendered
proceedings
under
the
act
unnecessary
and
we
have
not
therefore
the
light
of
experience
to
form
an
opinion
whether
such
a
plan
of
raising
a
military
force
is
practicable
other
states
passed
similar
laws
the
system
of
classing
was
borrowed
from
the
practice
of
the
i
have
heard
american
statesmen
confess
that
the
union
will
have
great
difficulty
in
maintaining
its
rank
on
the
seas
without
adopting
the
system
of
impressment
or
of
maritime
conscription
but
the
difficulty
is
to
induce
the
people
which
exercises
the
supreme
authority
to
submit
to
impressment
or
any
compulsory
system
it
is
incontestable
that
in
times
of
danger
a
free
people
displays
far
more
energy
than
one
which
is
not
so
but
i
incline
to
believe
that
this
is
more
especially
the
case
in
those
free
nations
in
which
the
democratic
element
preponderates
democracy
appears
to
me
to
be
much
better
adapted
for
the
peaceful
conduct
of
society
or
for
an
occasional
effort
of
remarkable
vigor
than
for
the
hardy
and
prolonged
endurance
of
the
storms
which
beset
the
political
existence
of
nations
the
reason
is
very
evident
it
is
enthusiasm
which
prompts
men
to
expose
themselves
to
dangers
and
privations
but
they
will
not
support
them
long
without
reflection
there
is
more
calculation
even
in
the
impulses
of
bravery
than
is
generally
attributed
to
them
and
although
the
first
efforts
are
suggested
by
passion
perseverance
is
maintained
by
a
distinct
regard
of
the
purpose
in
view
a
portion
of
what
we
value
is
exposed
in
order
to
save
the
remainder
but
it
is
this
distinct
perception
of
the
future
founded
upon
a
sound
judgment
and
an
enlightened
experience
which
is
most
frequently
wanting
in
democracies
the
populace
is
more
apt
to
feel
than
to
reason
and
if
its
present
sufferings
are
great
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
still
greater
sufferings
attendant
upon
defeat
will
be
forgotten
another
cause
tends
to
render
the
efforts
of
a
democratic
government
less
persevering
than
those
of
an
aristocracy
not
only
are
the
lower
classes
less
awakened
than
the
higher
orders
to
the
good
or
evil
chances
of
the
future
but
they
are
liable
to
suffer
far
more
acutely
from
present
privations
the
noble
exposes
his
life
indeed
but
the
chance
of
glory
is
equal
to
the
chance
of
harm
if
he
sacrifices
a
large
portion
of
his
income
to
the
state
he
deprives
himself
for
a
time
of
the
pleasure
of
affluence
but
to
the
poor
man
death
is
embellished
by
no
pomp
or
renown
and
the
imposts
which
are
irksome
to
the
rich
are
fatal
to
him
this
relative
impotence
of
democratic
republics
is
perhaps
the
greatest
obstacle
to
the
foundation
of
a
republic
of
this
kind
in
europe
in
order
that
such
a
state
should
subsist
in
one
country
of
the
old
world
it
would
be
necessary
that
similar
institutions
should
be
introduced
into
all
the
other
nations
i
am
of
opinion
that
a
democratic
government
tends
in
the
end
to
increase
the
real
strength
of
society
but
it
can
never
combine
upon
a
single
point
and
at
a
given
time
so
much
power
as
an
aristocracy
or
a
monarchy
if
a
democratic
country
remained
during
a
whole
century
subject
to
a
republican
government
it
would
probably
at
the
end
of
that
period
be
more
populous
and
more
prosperous
than
the
neighboring
despotic
states
but
it
would
have
incurred
the
risk
of
being
conquered
much
oftener
than
they
would
in
that
lapse
of
years
of
the
american
democracy
the
american
people
acquiesces
slowly
or
frequently
does
not
acquiesce
in
what
is
beneficial
to
its
the
faults
of
the
american
democracy
are
for
the
most
part
reparable
the
difficulty
which
a
democracy
has
in
conquering
the
passions
and
in
subduing
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
with
a
view
to
the
future
is
conspicuous
in
the
most
trivial
occurrences
in
the
united
states
the
people
which
is
surrounded
by
flatterers
has
great
difficulty
in
surmounting
its
inclinations
and
whenever
it
is
solicited
to
undergo
a
privation
or
any
kind
of
inconvenience
even
to
attain
an
end
which
is
sanctioned
by
its
own
rational
conviction
it
almost
always
refuses
to
comply
at
first
the
deference
of
the
americans
to
the
laws
has
been
very
justly
applauded
but
it
must
be
added
that
in
america
the
legislation
is
made
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
consequently
in
the
united
states
the
law
favors
those
classes
which
are
most
interested
in
evading
it
elsewhere
it
may
therefore
be
supposed
that
an
offensive
law
which
should
not
be
acknowledged
to
be
one
of
immediate
utility
would
either
not
be
enacted
or
would
not
be
obeyed
in
america
there
is
no
law
against
fraudulent
bankruptcies
not
because
they
are
few
but
because
there
are
a
great
number
of
bankruptcies
the
dread
of
being
prosecuted
as
a
bankrupt
acts
with
more
intensity
upon
the
mind
of
the
majority
of
the
people
than
the
fear
of
being
involved
in
losses
or
ruin
by
the
failure
of
other
parties
and
a
sort
of
guilty
tolerance
is
extended
by
the
public
conscience
to
an
offence
which
every
one
condemns
in
his
individual
capacity
in
the
new
states
of
the
southwest
the
citizens
generally
take
justice
into
their
own
hands
and
murders
are
of
very
frequent
occurrence
this
arises
from
the
rude
manners
and
the
ignorance
of
the
inhabitants
of
those
deserts
who
do
not
perceive
the
utility
of
investing
the
law
with
adequate
force
and
who
prefer
duels
to
prosecutions
some
one
observed
to
me
one
day
in
philadelphia
that
almost
all
crimes
in
america
are
caused
by
the
abuse
of
intoxicating
liquors
which
the
lower
classes
can
procure
in
great
abundance
from
their
excessive
how
comes
it
said
i
that
you
do
not
put
a
duty
upon
brandy
our
legislators
rejoined
my
informant
have
frequently
thought
of
this
expedient
but
the
task
of
putting
it
in
operation
is
a
difficult
one
a
revolt
might
be
apprehended
and
the
members
who
should
vote
for
a
law
of
this
kind
would
be
sure
of
losing
their
seats
whence
i
am
to
infer
i
replied
that
the
drinking
population
constitutes
the
majority
in
your
country
and
that
temperance
is
somewhat
unpopular
when
these
things
are
pointed
out
to
the
american
statesmen
they
content
themselves
with
assuring
you
that
time
will
operate
the
necessary
change
and
that
the
experience
of
evil
will
teach
the
people
its
true
interests
this
is
frequently
true
although
a
democracy
is
more
liable
to
error
than
a
monarch
or
a
body
of
nobles
the
chances
of
its
regaining
the
right
path
when
once
it
has
acknowledged
its
mistake
are
greater
also
because
it
is
rarely
embarrassed
by
internal
interests
which
conflict
with
those
of
the
majority
and
resist
the
authority
of
reason
but
a
democracy
can
only
obtain
truth
as
the
result
of
experience
and
many
nations
may
forfeit
their
existence
while
they
are
awaiting
the
consequences
of
their
errors
the
great
privilege
of
the
americans
does
not
simply
consist
in
their
being
more
enlightened
than
other
nations
but
in
their
being
able
to
repair
the
faults
they
may
commit
to
which
it
must
be
added
that
a
democracy
can
not
derive
substantial
benefit
from
past
experience
unless
it
be
arrived
at
a
certain
pitch
of
knowledge
and
civilisation
there
are
tribes
and
peoples
whose
education
has
been
so
vicious
and
whose
character
presents
so
strange
a
mixture
of
passion
of
ignorance
and
of
erroneous
notions
upon
all
subjects
that
they
are
unable
to
discern
the
cause
of
their
own
wretchedness
and
they
fall
a
sacrifice
to
ills
with
which
they
are
unacquainted
i
have
crossed
vast
tracts
of
country
that
were
formerly
inhabited
by
powerful
indian
nations
which
are
now
extinct
i
have
myself
passed
some
time
in
the
midst
of
mutilated
tribes
which
see
the
daily
decline
of
their
numerical
strength
and
of
the
glory
of
their
independence
and
i
have
heard
these
indians
themselves
anticipate
the
impending
doom
of
their
race
every
european
can
perceive
means
which
would
rescue
these
unfortunate
beings
from
inevitable
destruction
they
alone
are
insensible
to
the
expedient
they
feel
the
woe
which
year
after
year
heaps
upon
their
heads
but
they
will
perish
to
a
man
without
accepting
the
remedy
it
would
be
necessary
to
employ
force
to
induce
them
to
submit
to
the
protection
and
the
constraint
of
civilisation
the
incessant
revolutions
which
have
convulsed
the
south
american
provinces
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
have
frequently
been
adverted
to
with
astonishment
and
expectations
have
been
expressed
that
those
nations
would
speedily
return
to
their
natural
state
but
can
it
be
affirmed
that
the
turmoil
of
revolution
is
not
actually
the
most
natural
state
of
the
south
american
spaniards
at
the
present
time
in
that
country
society
is
plunged
into
difficulties
from
which
all
its
efforts
are
insufficient
to
rescue
it
the
inhabitants
of
that
fair
portion
of
the
western
hemisphere
seem
obstinately
bent
on
pursuing
the
work
of
inward
havoc
if
they
fall
into
a
momentary
repose
from
the
effects
of
exhaustion
that
repose
prepares
them
for
a
fresh
state
of
phrensy
when
i
consider
their
condition
which
alternates
between
misery
and
crime
i
should
be
inclined
to
believe
that
despotism
itself
would
be
a
benefit
to
them
if
it
were
possible
that
the
words
despotism
and
benefit
could
ever
be
united
in
my
mind
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
by
the
american
democracy
direction
given
to
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
by
washington
and
almost
all
the
defects
inherent
in
democratic
institutions
are
brought
to
light
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
their
advantages
are
less
perceptible
we
have
seen
that
the
federal
constitution
intrusts
the
permanent
direction
of
the
external
interests
of
the
nation
to
the
president
and
the
senate
which
tends
in
some
degree
to
detach
the
general
foreign
policy
of
the
union
from
the
control
of
the
people
it
can
not
therefore
be
asserted
with
truth
that
the
external
affairs
of
state
are
conducted
by
the
democracy
the
policy
of
america
owes
its
rise
to
washington
and
after
him
to
jefferson
who
established
those
principles
which
it
observes
at
the
present
day
washington
said
in
the
admirable
letter
which
he
addressed
to
his
and
which
may
be
looked
upon
as
his
political
bequest
to
the
country
the
great
rule
of
conduct
for
us
in
regard
to
foreign
nations
is
extending
our
commercial
relations
to
have
with
them
as
little
connexion
as
possible
so
far
as
we
have
already
formed
engagements
let
them
lie
fulfilled
with
perfect
good
faith
here
let
us
stop
europe
has
a
set
of
primary
interests
which
to
us
have
none
or
a
very
remote
relation
hence
she
must
be
engaged
in
frequent
controversies
the
causes
of
which
are
essentially
foreign
to
our
concerns
hence
therefore
it
must
be
unwise
in
us
to
implicate
ourselves
by
artificial
ties
in
the
ordinary
vicissitudes
of
her
politics
or
the
ordinary
combinations
and
collisions
of
her
friendships
or
enmities
our
detached
and
distant
situation
invites
and
enables
us
to
pursue
a
different
course
if
we
remain
one
people
under
an
efficient
government
the
period
is
not
far
off
when
we
may
defy
material
injury
from
external
annoyance
when
we
may
take
such
an
attitude
as
will
cause
the
neutrality
we
may
at
any
time
resolve
upon
to
be
scrupulously
respected
when
belligerent
nations
under
the
impossibility
of
making
acquisitions
upon
us
will
not
lightly
hazard
the
giving
us
provocation
when
we
may
choose
peace
or
war
as
our
interest
guided
by
justice
shall
counsel
why
forego
the
advantages
of
so
peculiar
a
situation
why
quit
our
own
to
stand
upon
foreign
ground
why
by
interweaving
our
destiny
with
that
of
any
part
of
europe
entangle
our
peace
and
prosperity
in
the
toils
of
european
ambition
rivalship
interest
humor
or
caprice
it
is
our
true
policy
to
steer
clear
of
permanent
alliances
with
any
portion
of
the
foreign
world
so
far
i
mean
as
we
are
now
at
liberty
to
do
it
for
let
me
not
be
understood
as
capable
of
patronising
infidelity
to
existing
engagements
i
hold
the
maxim
no
less
applicable
to
public
than
to
private
affairs
that
honesty
is
always
the
best
policy
i
repeat
it
therefore
let
those
engagements
be
observed
in
their
genuine
sense
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
unnecessary
and
would
be
unwise
to
extend
them
taking
care
always
to
keep
ourselves
by
suitable
establishments
in
a
respectable
defensive
posture
we
may
safely
trust
to
temporary
alliances
for
extraordinary
emergencies
in
a
previous
part
of
the
same
letter
washington
makes
the
following
admirable
and
just
remark
the
nation
which
indulges
toward
another
an
habitual
hatred
or
an
habitual
fondness
is
in
some
degree
a
slave
it
is
a
slave
to
its
animosity
or
its
affection
either
of
which
is
sufficient
to
lead
it
astray
from
its
duty
and
its
interest
the
political
conduct
of
washington
was
always
guided
by
these
maxims
he
succeeded
in
maintaining
his
country
in
a
state
of
peace
while
all
the
other
nations
of
the
globe
were
at
war
and
he
laid
it
down
as
a
fundamental
doctrine
that
the
true
interest
of
the
americans
consisted
in
a
perfect
neutrality
with
regard
to
the
internal
dissensions
of
the
european
powers
jefferson
went
still
farther
and
introduced
a
maxim
into
the
policy
of
the
union
which
affirms
that
the
americans
ought
never
to
solicit
any
privileges
from
foreign
nations
in
order
not
to
be
obliged
to
grant
similar
privileges
themselves
these
two
principles
which
were
so
plain
and
so
just
as
to
be
adapted
to
the
capacity
of
the
populace
have
greatly
simplified
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
as
the
union
takes
no
part
in
the
affairs
of
europe
it
has
properly
speaking
no
foreign
interests
to
discuss
since
it
has
at
present
no
powerful
neighbors
on
the
american
continent
the
country
is
as
much
removed
from
the
passions
of
the
old
world
by
its
position
as
by
the
line
of
policy
which
it
has
chosen
and
it
is
neither
called
upon
to
repudiate
nor
to
espouse
the
conflicting
interests
of
europe
while
the
dissensions
of
the
new
world
are
still
concealed
within
the
bosom
of
the
future
the
union
is
free
from
all
obligations
and
it
is
consequently
enabled
to
profit
by
the
experience
of
the
old
nations
of
europe
without
being
obliged
as
they
are
to
make
the
best
of
the
past
and
to
adapt
it
to
their
present
circumstances
or
to
accept
that
immense
inheritance
which
they
derive
from
their
forefathers
an
inheritance
of
glory
mingled
with
calamities
and
of
alliances
conflicting
with
national
antipathies
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
is
reduced
by
its
very
nature
to
await
the
chances
of
the
future
history
of
the
nation
and
for
the
present
it
consists
more
in
abstaining
from
interference
than
in
exerting
its
activity
it
is
therefore
very
difficult
to
ascertain
at
present
what
degree
of
sagacity
the
american
democracy
will
display
in
the
conduct
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
country
and
upon
this
point
its
adversaries
as
well
as
its
advocates
must
suspend
their
judgment
as
for
myself
i
have
no
hesitation
in
avowing
my
conviction
that
it
is
most
especially
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations
that
democratic
governments
appear
to
me
to
be
decidedly
inferior
to
governments
carried
on
upon
different
principles
experience
instruction
and
habit
may
almost
always
succeed
in
creating
a
species
of
practical
discretion
in
democracies
and
that
science
of
the
daily
occurrences
of
life
which
is
called
good
sense
good
sense
may
suffice
to
direct
the
ordinary
course
of
society
and
among
a
people
whose
education
has
been
provided
for
the
advantages
of
democratic
liberty
in
the
internal
affairs
of
the
country
may
more
than
compensate
for
the
evils
inherent
in
a
democratic
government
but
such
is
not
always
the
case
in
the
mutual
relations
of
foreign
nations
foreign
politics
demand
scarcely
any
of
those
qualities
which
a
democracy
possesses
and
they
require
on
the
contrary
the
perfect
use
of
almost
all
those
faculties
in
which
it
is
deficient
democracy
is
favorable
to
the
increase
of
the
internal
resources
of
a
state
it
tends
to
diffuse
a
moderate
independence
it
promotes
the
growth
of
public
spirit
and
fortifies
the
respect
which
is
entertained
for
law
in
all
classes
of
society
and
these
are
advantages
which
only
exercise
an
indirect
influence
over
the
relations
which
one
people
bears
to
another
but
a
democracy
is
unable
to
regulate
the
details
of
an
important
undertaking
to
persevere
in
a
design
and
to
work
out
its
execution
in
the
presence
of
serious
obstacles
it
can
not
combine
its
measures
with
secrecy
and
will
not
await
their
consequences
with
patience
these
are
qualities
which
more
especially
belong
to
an
individual
or
to
an
aristocracy
and
they
are
precisely
the
means
by
which
an
individual
people
attains
a
predominant
position
if
on
the
contrary
we
observe
the
natural
defects
of
aristocracy
we
shall
find
that
their
influence
is
comparatively
innoxious
in
the
direction
of
the
external
affairs
of
a
state
the
capital
fault
of
which
aristocratic
bodies
may
be
accused
is
that
they
are
more
apt
to
contrive
their
own
advantage
than
that
of
the
mass
of
the
people
in
foreign
politics
it
is
rare
for
the
interest
of
the
aristocracy
to
be
in
any
way
distinct
from
that
of
the
people
the
propensity
which
democracies
have
to
obey
the
impulse
of
passion
rather
than
the
suggestions
of
prudence
and
to
abandon
a
mature
design
for
the
gratification
of
a
momentary
caprice
was
very
clearly
seen
in
america
on
the
breaking
out
of
the
french
revolution
it
was
then
as
evident
to
the
simplest
capacity
as
it
is
at
the
present
time
that
the
interests
of
the
americans
forbade
them
to
take
any
part
in
the
contest
which
was
about
to
deluge
europe
with
blood
but
which
could
by
no
means
injure
the
welfare
of
their
own
country
nevertheless
the
sympathies
of
the
people
declared
themselves
with
so
much
violence
in
behalf
of
france
that
nothing
but
the
inflexible
character
of
washington
and
the
immense
popularity
which
he
enjoyed
could
have
prevented
the
americans
from
declaring
war
against
england
and
even
then
the
exertions
which
the
austere
reason
of
that
great
man
made
to
repress
the
generous
but
imprudent
passions
of
his
very
nearly
deprived
him
of
the
sole
recompense
which
he
had
ever
claimed
that
of
his
love
the
majority
then
reprobated
the
line
of
policy
which
he
adopted
and
which
has
since
been
unanimously
approved
by
the
nation
if
the
constitution
and
the
favor
of
the
public
had
not
intrusted
the
direction
of
the
foreign
affairs
of
the
country
to
washington
it
is
certain
that
the
american
nation
would
at
that
time
have
taken
the
very
measures
which
it
now
condemns
almost
all
the
nations
which
have
exercised
a
powerful
influence
upon
the
destinies
of
the
world
by
conceiving
following
up
and
executing
vast
designs
from
the
romans
to
the
english
have
been
governed
by
aristocratic
institutions
nor
will
this
be
a
subject
of
wonder
when
we
recollect
that
nothing
in
the
world
has
so
absolute
a
fixity
of
purpose
as
an
aristocracy
the
mass
of
the
people
may
be
led
astray
by
ignorance
or
passion
the
mind
of
a
king
may
be
biased
and
his
perseverance
in
his
designs
may
be
shaken
beside
which
a
king
is
not
immortal
but
an
aristocratic
body
is
too
numerous
to
be
led
astray
by
the
blandishments
of
intrigue
and
yet
not
numerous
enough
to
yield
readily
to
the
intoxicating
influence
of
unreflecting
passion
it
has
the
energy
of
a
firm
and
enlightened
individual
added
to
the
power
which
it
derives
from
its
perpetuity
notes
i
here
use
the
word
in
the
widest
sense
in
which
it
can
be
taken

apply
it

all

observe
that
i
speak
here
of
the
democratic

merely
to

the
word
is
used
here
and
throughout
the
remainder
of
this
chapter
in
a
relative
and
not
in
an
absolute
sense
poor
men
in
america
would
often
appear
rich
in
comparison
with
the
poor
of
europe
but
they
may
with
propriety
be
styled
poor
in

their
more
affluent
countrymen

easy
circumstances
in
which
secondary
functionaries
are
placed
in
the
united
states
result
also
from
another
cause
which
is
independent
of
the
general
tendencies
of
democracy
every
kind
of
private
business
is
very
lucrative
and
the
state
would
not
be
served
at
all
if
it
did
not
pay
its
servants
the
country
is
in
the
position
of
a
commercial
undertaking
which
is
obliged
to
sustain
an
expensive
competition
notwithstanding
its
taste
for
economy
the
state
of
ohio
which
contains
a
million
of
inhabitants
gives
its
governor
a
salary
of
only
a
year
to
render
this
assertion
perfectly
evident
it
will
suffice
to
examine
the
scale
of
salaries
of
the
agents
of
the
federal
government
i
have
added
the
salaries
attached
to
the
corresponding
officers
in
france

complete
the

the

an
influence
upon

and

a
disposition
to
raise
the
lowest

and
to

which
is
not
more
than
double
the
amount
of
population
in
the
department
du
nord
in
france
the
americans
as
we
have
seen
have
four
separate
budgets
the
union
the
states
the
counties
and
the
townships
having
each
severally
their
own
during
my
stay
in
america
i
made
every
endeavor
to
discover
the
amount
of
the
public
expenditure
in
the
townships
and
counties
of
the
principal
states
of
the
union
and
i
readily
obtained
the
budget
of
the
larger
townships
but
i
found
it
quite
impossible
to
procure
that
of
the
smaller
ones
i
possess
however
some
documents
relating
to
county
expenses
which
although
incomplete
are
still
curious
i
have
to
thank
richards
mayor
of
philadelphia
for
the
budgets
of
thirteen
of
the
counties
of
pennsylvania
viz
lebanon
centre
franklin
fayette
montgomery
luzerne
dauphin
butler
allegany
columbia
northampton
northumberland
and
philadelphia
for
the
year
their
population
at
that
time
consisted
of
inhabitants
on
looking
at
the
map
of
pennsylvania
it
will
be
seen
that
these
thirteen
counties
are
scattered
in
every
direction
and
so
generally
affected
by
the
causes
which
usually
influence
the
condition
of
a
country
that
they
may
easily
be
supposed
to
furnish
a
correct
average
of
the
financial
state
of
the
counties
of
pennsylvania
in
general
and
thus
upon
reckoning
that
the
expenses
of
these
counties
amounted
in
the
year
to
about
or
nearly
for
each
inhabitant
and
calculating
that
each
of
them
contributed
in
the
same
year
about
toward
the
union
and
about
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
it
appears
that
they
each
contributed
as
their
share
of
all
the
public
expenses
except
those
of
the
townships
the
sum
of
this
calculation
is
doubly
incomplete
as
it
applies
only
to
a
single
year
and
to
one
part
of
the
public
charges
but
it
has
at
least
the
merit
of
not
being
conjectural
those
who
have
attempted
to
draw
a
comparison
between
the
expenses
of
france
and
america
have
at
once
perceived
that
no
such
comparison
could
be
drawn
between
the
total
expenditures
of
the
two
countries
but
they
have
endeavored
to
contrast
detached
portions
of
this
expenditure
it
may
readily
be
shown
that
this
second
system
is
not
at
all
less
defective
than
the
first
even
if
we
knew
the
exact
pecuniary
contributions
of
every
french
and
american
citizen
to
the
coffers
of
the
state
we
should
only
come
at
a
portion
of
the
truth
governments
not
only
demand
supplies
of
money
but
they
call
for
personal
services
which
may
be
looked
upon
as
equivalent
to
a
given
sum
when
a
state
raises
an
army
beside
the
pay
of
the
troops
which
is
furnished
by
the
entire
nation
each
soldier
must
give
up
his
time
the
value
of
which
depends
on
the
use
he
might
make
of
it
if
he
were
not
in
the
service
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
militia
the
citizen
who
is
in
the
militia
devotes
a
certain
portion
of
valuable
time
to
the
maintenance
of
the
public
peace
and
he
does
in
reality
surrender
to
the
state
those
earnings
which
he
is
prevented
from
gaining
many
other
instances
might
be
cited
in
addition
to
these
the
governments
of
france
and
america
both
levy
taxes
of
this
kind
which
weigh
upon
the
citizens
but
who
can
estimate
with
accuracy
their
relative
amount
in
the
two
countries
this
however
is
not
the
last
of
the
difficulties
which
prevent
us
from
comparing
the
expenditure
of
the
union
with
that
of
france
the
french
government
contracts
certain
obligations
which
do
not
exist
in
america
and
the
french
government
pays
the
clergy
in
america
the
voluntary
principle
prevails
in
america
there
is
a
legal
provision
for
the
poor
in
france
they
are
abandoned
to
the
charity
of
the
public
the
french
public
officers
are
paid
by
a
fixed
salary
in
america
they
are
allowed
certain
perquisites
in
france
contributions
in
kind
take
place
on
very
few
roads
in
america
upon
almost
all
the
thoroughfares
in
the
former
country
the
roads
are
free
to
all
travellers
in
the
latter
turnpikes
abound
all
these
differences
in
manner
in
which
contributions
are
levied
in
the
two
countries
enhance
the
difficulty
of
comparing
their
expenditure
for
there
are
certain
expenses
which
the
citizens
would
not
be
subjected
to
or
which
would
at
any
rate
be
much
less
considerable
if
the
state
did
not
take
upon
itself
to
act
in
the
name
of
the
public
see
the
details
in

of
the
french
minister
of
marine

for

the
national
calendar
of
one
of
the
most
singular
of
these
occurrences
was
the
resolution
which
the
americans
took
of
temporarily
abandoning
the
use
of
tea
those
who
know
that
men
usually
cling
more
to
their
habits
than
to
their
life
will
doubtless
admire
this
great
and
obscure
sacrifice
which
was
made
by
a
whole
people

shall
have
power

and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of

senate

make
treaties
provided
of
the
senators
present
concur
the
reader
is
reminded
that
the
senators
are
returned
for
a
term
of
six
years
and
that
they
are
chosen
by
the
legislature
of
each
state
see

fifth
volume
of
marshall
life
of
washington
in
a
government
constituted
like
that
of
the
united
states
he
says
it
is
impossible
for
the
chief
magistrate
however
firm
he
may
be
to
oppose
for
any
length
of
time
the
torrents
of
popular
opinion
and
the
prevalent
opinion
of
that
day
seemed
to
incline
to
war

fact
in
the
session
of
congress
held
at
the
time
it
was
frequently
seen
that
washington
had
lost
the
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
violence
of
the
language
used
against
him
in
public
was
extreme
and
in
a
political
meeting
they
did
not
scruple
to
compare

indirectly
to
the
treacherous
arnold

the
opposition
says
marshall
the
friends
of
the
administration
were
declared
to
be
an
aristocratic
and
corrupt
faction

from
a
desire
to
introduce
monarchy
were
hostile
to

influence
of

that
they
were
a
paper

whose
extreme
sensibility
at
every
measure
which
threatened

induced

tame
submission

injuries
and
insults

chapter
xiv
what
the
real
advantages
are
which
american
society
derives
from
the
government
of
the
democracy
before
i
enter
upon
the
subject
of
the
present
chapter
i
am
induced
to
remind
the
reader
of
what
i
have
more
than
once
adverted
to
in
the
course
of
this
book
the
political
institutions
of
the
united
states
appear
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
forms
of
government
which
a
democracy
may
adopt
but
i
do
not
regard
the
american
constitution
as
the
best
or
as
the
only
one
which
a
democratic
people
may
establish
in
showing
the
advantages
which
the
americans
derive
from
the
government
of
democracy
i
am
therefore
very
far
from
meaning
or
from
believing
that
similar
advantages
can
be
obtained
only
from
the
same
laws
general
tendency
of
the
laws
under
the
rule
of
the
american
democracy
and
habits
of
those
who
apply
them
defects
of
a
democratic
government
easy
to
be
its
advantages
only
to
be
discerned
by
long
democracy
in
america
often
inexpert
but
the
general
tendency
of
the
laws
in
the
american
democracy
public
officers
have
no
permanent
interests
distinct
from
those
of
the
result
of
this
state
of
things
the
defects
and
the
weaknesses
of
a
democratic
government
may
very
readily
be
discovered
they
are
demonstrated
by
the
most
flagrant
instances
while
its
beneficial
influence
is
less
perceptibly
exercised
a
single
glance
suffices
to
detect
its
evil
consequences
but
its
good
qualities
can
only
be
discerned
by
long
observation
the
laws
of
the
american
democracy
are
frequently
defective
or
incomplete
they
sometimes
attack
vested
rights
or
give
a
sanction
to
others
which
are
dangerous
to
the
community
but
even
if
they
were
good
the
frequent
changes
which
they
undergo
would
be
an
evil
how
comes
it
then
that
the
american
republics
prosper
and
maintain
their
position
in
the
consideration
of
laws
a
distinction
must
be
carefully
observed
between
the
end
at
which
they
aim
and
the
means
by
which
they
are
directed
to
that
end
between
their
absolute
and
their
relative
excellence
if
it
be
the
intention
of
the
legislator
to
favor
the
interests
of
the
minority
at
the
expense
of
the
majority
and
if
the
measures
he
takes
are
so
combined
as
to
accomplish
the
object
he
has
in
view
with
the
least
possible
expense
of
time
and
exertion
the
law
may
be
well
drawn
up
although
its
purpose
be
bad
and
the
more
efficacious
it
is
the
greater
is
the
mischief
which
it
causes
democratic
laws
generally
tend
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
greatest
possible
number
for
they
emanate
from
a
majority
of
the
citizens
who
are
subject
to
error
but
who
can
not
have
an
interest
opposed
to
their
own
advantage
the
laws
of
an
aristocracy
tend
on
the
contrary
to
concentrate
wealth
and
power
in
the
hands
of
the
minority
because
an
aristocracy
by
its
very
nature
constitutes
a
minority
it
may
therefore
be
asserted
as
a
general
proposition
that
the
purpose
of
a
democracy
in
the
conduct
of
its
legislation
is
useful
to
a
greater
number
of
citizens
than
that
of
an
aristocracy
this
is
however
the
sum
total
of
its
advantages
aristocracies
are
infinitely
more
expert
in
the
science
of
legislation
than
democracies
ever
can
be
they
are
possessed
of
a
which
protects
them
from
the
errors
of
a
temporary
excitement
and
they
form
lasting
designs
which
they
mature
with
the
assistance
of
favorable
opportunities
aristocratic
government
proceeds
with
the
dexterity
of
art
it
understands
how
to
make
the
collective
force
of
all
its
laws
converge
at
the
same
time
to
a
given
point
such
is
not
the
case
with
democracies
whose
laws
are
almost
always
ineffective
or
inopportune
the
means
of
democracy
are
therefore
more
imperfect
than
those
of
aristocracy
and
the
measures
which
it
unwittingly
adopts
are
frequently
opposed
to
its
own
cause
but
the
object
it
has
in
view
is
more
useful
let
us
now
imagine
a
community
so
organized
by
nature
or
by
its
constitution
that
it
can
support
the
transitory
action
of
bad
laws
and
it
can
await
without
destruction
the
general
tendency
of
the
legislation
we
shall
then
be
able
to
conceive
that
a
democratic
government
notwithstanding
its
defects
will
be
most
fitted
to
conduce
to
the
prosperity
of
this
community
this
is
precisely
what
has
occurred
in
the
united
states
and
i
repeat
what
i
have
before
remarked
that
the
great
advantage
of
the
americans
consists
in
their
being
able
to
commit
faults
which
they
may
afterward
repair
an
analogous
observation
may
be
made
respecting
officers
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
the
american
democracy
frequently
errs
in
the
choice
of
the
individuals
to
whom
it
intrusts
the
power
of
the
administration
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
say
why
the
state
prospers
under
their
rule
in
the
first
place
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
if
in
a
democratic
state
the
governors
have
less
honesty
and
less
capacity
than
elsewhere
the
governed
on
the
other
hand
are
more
enlightened
and
more
attentive
to
their
interests
as
the
people
in
democracies
is
more
incessantly
vigilant
in
its
affairs
and
more
jealous
of
its
rights
it
prevents
its
representatives
from
abandoning
that
general
line
of
conduct
which
its
own
interest
prescribes
in
the
second
place
it
must
be
remembered
that
if
the
democratic
magistrate
is
more
apt
to
misuse
his
power
he
possesses
it
for
a
shorter
period
of
time
but
there
is
yet
another
reason
which
is
still
more
general
and
conclusive
it
is
no
doubt
of
importance
to
the
welfare
of
nations
that
they
should
be
governed
by
men
of
talents
and
virtue
but
it
is
perhaps
still
more
important
that
the
interests
of
those
men
should
not
differ
from
the
interests
of
the
community
at
large
for
if
such
were
the
case
virtues
of
a
high
order
might
become
useless
and
talents
might
be
turned
to
a
bad
account
i
say
that
it
is
important
that
the
interests
of
the
persons
in
authority
should
not
conflict
with
or
oppose
the
interests
of
the
community
at
large
but
i
do
not
insist
upon
their
having
the
same
interests
as
the
population
because
i
am
not
aware
that
such
a
state
of
things
ever
existed
in
any
country
no
political
form
has
hitherto
been
discovered
which
is
equally
favorable
to
the
prosperity
and
the
development
of
all
the
classes
into
which
society
is
divided
these
classes
continue
to
form
as
it
were
a
certain
number
of
distinct
nations
in
the
same
nation
and
experience
has
shown
that
it
is
no
less
dangerous
to
place
the
fate
of
these
classes
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
any
one
of
them
than
it
is
to
make
one
people
the
arbiter
of
the
destiny
of
another
when
the
rich
alone
govern
the
interest
of
the
poor
is
always
endangered
and
when
the
poor
make
the
laws
that
of
the
rich
incurs
very
serious
risks
the
advantage
of
democracy
does
not
consist
therefore
as
has
been
sometimes
asserted
in
favoring
the
prosperity
of
all
but
simply
in
contributing
to
the
of
the
greatest
possible
number
the
men
who
are
entrusted
with
the
direction
of
public
affairs
in
the
united
states
are
frequently
inferior
both
in
capacity
and
of
morality
to
those
whom
aristocratic
institutions
would
raise
to
power
but
their
interest
is
identified
and
confounded
with
that
of
the
majority
of
their
they
may
frequently
be
faithless
and
frequently
mistake
but
they
will
never
systematically
adopt
a
line
of
conduct
opposed
to
the
will
of
the
majority
and
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
give
a
dangerous
or
an
exclusive
tendency
to
the
government
the
of
a
democratic
magistrate
is
a
mere
isolated
fact
which
only
occurs
during
the
short
period
for
which
he
is
elected
corruption
and
incapacity
do
not
act
as
common
interests
which
may
connect
men
permanently
with
one
another
a
corrupt
or
an
incapable
magistrate
will
concert
his
measures
with
another
magistrate
simply
because
that
individual
is
as
corrupt
and
as
incapable
as
himself
and
these
two
men
will
never
unite
their
endeavors
to
promote
the
corruption
and
inaptitude
of
their
remote
posterity
the
ambition
and
manoeuvres
of
the
one
will
serve
on
the
contrary
to
unmask
the
other
the
vices
of
a
magistrate
in
democratic
states
are
usually
peculiar
to
his
own
person
but
under
aristocratic
governments
public
men
are
swayed
by
the
interests
of
their
order
which
if
it
is
sometimes
confounded
with
the
interests
of
the
majority
is
very
frequently
distinct
from
them
this
interest
is
the
common
and
lasting
bond
which
unites
them
together
it
induces
them
to
coalesce
and
to
combine
their
efforts
in
order
to
attain
an
end
which
does
not
always
ensure
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
and
it
serves
not
only
to
connect
the
persons
in
authority
but
to
unite
them
to
a
considerable
portion
of
the
community
since
a
numerous
body
of
citizens
belongs
to
the
aristocracy
without
being
invested
with
official
functions
the
aristocratic
magistrate
is
therefore
constantly
supported
by
a
portion
of
the
community
as
well
as
by
the
government
of
which
he
is
a
member
the
common
purpose
which
connects
the
interest
of
the
magistrates
in
aristocracies
with
that
of
a
portion
of
their
contemporaries
identifies
it
with
that
of
future
generations
their
influence
belongs
to
the
future
as
much
as
to
the
present
the
aristocratic
magistrate
is
urged
at
the
same
time
toward
the
same
point
by
the
passions
of
the
community
by
his
own
and
i
may
almost
add
by
those
of
his
posterity
is
it
then
wonderful
that
he
does
not
resist
such
repeated
impulses
and
indeed
aristocracies
are
often
carried
away
by
the
spirit
of
their
order
without
being
corrupted
by
it
and
they
unconsciously
fashion
society
to
their
own
ends
and
prepare
it
for
their
own
descendants
the
english
aristocracy
is
perhaps
the
most
liberal
which
ever
existed
and
no
body
of
men
has
ever
uninterruptedly
furnished
so
many
honorable
and
enlightened
individuals
to
the
government
of
a
country
it
can
not
however
escape
observation
that
in
the
legislation
of
england
the
good
of
the
poor
has
been
sacrificed
to
the
advantage
of
the
rich
and
the
rights
of
the
majority
to
the
privileges
of
the
few
the
consequence
is
that
england
at
the
present
day
combines
the
extremes
of
fortune
in
the
bosom
of
her
society
and
her
perils
and
calamities
are
almost
equal
to
her
power
and
her
renown
in
the
united
states
where
the
public
officers
have
no
interests
to
promote
connected
with
their
caste
the
general
and
constant
influence
of
the
government
is
beneficial
although
the
individuals
who
conduct
it
are
frequently
unskilful
and
sometimes
contemptible
there
is
indeed
a
secret
tendency
in
democratic
institutions
to
render
the
exertions
of
the
citizens
subservient
to
the
prosperity
of
the
community
notwithstanding
their
private
vices
and
mistakes
while
in
aristocratic
institutions
there
is
a
secret
propensity
which
notwithstanding
the
talents
and
the
virtues
of
those
who
conduct
the
government
leads
them
to
contribute
to
the
evils
which
oppress
their
fellow
creatures
in
aristocratic
governments
public
men
may
frequently
do
injuries
which
they
do
not
intend
and
in
democratic
states
they
produce
advantages
which
they
never
thought
of
public
spirit
in
the
united
states
patriotism
of
patriotism
of
their
different
nations
ought
to
strive
to
acquire
the
second
when
the
first
has
efforts
of
the
americans
to
acquire
interest
of
the
individual
intimately
connected
with
that
of
the
country
there
is
one
sort
of
patriotic
attachment
which
principally
arises
from
that
instinctive
disinterested
and
undefinable
feeling
which
connects
the
affections
of
man
with
his
birthplace
this
natural
fondness
is
united
to
a
taste
for
ancient
customs
and
to
a
reverence
for
ancestral
traditions
of
the
past
those
who
cherish
it
love
their
country
as
they
love
the
mansion
of
their
fathers
they
enjoy
the
tranquillity
which
it
affords
them
they
cling
to
the
peaceful
habits
which
they
have
contracted
within
its
bosom
they
are
attached
to
the
reminiscences
which
it
awakens
and
they
are
even
pleased
by
the
state
of
obedience
in
which
they
are
placed
this
patriotism
is
sometimes
stimulated
by
religious
enthusiasm
and
then
it
is
capable
of
making
the
most
prodigious
efforts
it
is
in
itself
a
kind
of
religion
it
does
not
reason
but
it
acts
from
the
impulse
of
faith
and
of
sentiment
by
some
nations
the
monarch
has
been
regarded
as
a
personification
of
the
country
and
the
fervor
of
patriotism
being
converted
into
the
fervor
of
loyalty
they
took
a
sympathetic
pride
in
his
conquests
and
gloried
in
his
power
at
one
time
under
the
ancient
monarchy
the
french
felt
a
sort
of
satisfaction
in
the
sense
of
their
dependence
upon
the
arbitrary
pleasure
of
their
king
and
they
were
wont
to
say
with
pride
we
are
the
subjects
of
the
most
powerful
king
in
the
world
but
like
all
instinctive
passions
this
kind
of
patriotism
is
more
apt
to
prompt
transient
exertion
than
to
supply
the
motives
of
continuous
endeavor
it
may
save
the
state
in
critical
circumstances
but
it
will
not
unfrequently
allow
the
nation
to
decline
in
the
midst
of
peace
while
the
manners
of
a
people
are
simple
and
its
faith
unshaken
while
society
is
steadily
based
upon
traditional
institutions
whose
legitimacy
has
never
been
contested
this
instinctive
patriotism
is
wont
to
endure
but
there
is
another
species
of
attachment
to
a
country
which
is
more
rational
than
the
one
we
have
been
describing
it
is
perhaps
less
generous
and
less
ardent
but
it
is
more
fruitful
and
more
lasting
it
is
coeval
with
the
spread
of
knowledge
it
is
nurtured
by
the
laws
it
grows
by
the
exercise
of
civil
rights
and
in
the
end
it
is
confounded
with
the
personal
interest
of
the
citizen
a
man
comprehends
the
influence
which
the
prosperity
of
his
country
has
upon
his
own
welfare
he
is
aware
that
the
laws
authorize
him
to
contribute
his
assistance
to
that
prosperity
and
he
labors
to
promote
it
as
a
portion
of
his
interest
in
the
first
place
and
as
a
portion
of
his
right
in
the
second
but
epochs
sometimes
occur
in
the
course
of
the
existence
of
a
nation
at
which
the
ancient
customs
of
a
people
are
changed
public
morality
destroyed
religious
belief
disturbed
and
the
spell
of
tradition
broken
while
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
is
yet
imperfect
and
the
civil
rights
of
the
community
are
ill
secured
or
confined
within
very
narrow
limits
the
country
then
assumes
a
dim
and
dubious
shape
in
the
eyes
of
the
citizens
they
no
longer
behold
it
in
the
soil
which
they
inhabit
for
that
soil
is
to
them
a
dull
inanimate
clod
nor
in
the
usages
of
their
forefathers
which
they
have
been
taught
to
look
upon
as
a
debasing
yoke
nor
in
religion
for
of
that
they
doubt
nor
in
the
laws
which
do
not
originate
in
their
own
authority
nor
in
the
legislator
whom
they
fear
and
despise
the
country
is
lost
to
their
senses
they
can
neither
discover
it
under
its
own
nor
under
borrowed
features
and
they
intrench
themselves
within
the
dull
precincts
of
a
narrow
egotism
they
are
emancipated
from
prejudice
without
having
acknowledged
the
empire
of
reason
they
are
animated
neither
by
the
instinctive
patriotism
of
monarchical
subjects
nor
by
the
thinking
patriotism
of
republican
citizens
but
they
have
stopped
between
the
two
in
the
midst
of
confusion
and
of
distress
in
this
predicament
to
retreat
is
impossible
for
a
people
can
not
restore
the
vivacity
of
its
earlier
times
any
more
than
a
man
can
return
to
the
innocence
and
the
bloom
of
childhood
such
things
may
be
regretted
but
they
can
not
be
renewed
the
only
thing
then
which
remains
to
be
done
is
to
proceed
and
to
accelerate
the
union
of
private
with
public
interests
since
the
period
of
disinterested
patriotism
is
gone
by
for
ever
i
am
certainly
very
far
from
averring
that
in
order
to
obtain
this
result
the
exercise
of
political
rights
should
be
immediately
granted
to
all
the
members
of
the
community
but
i
maintain
that
the
most
powerful
and
perhaps
the
only
means
of
interesting
men
in
the
welfare
of
their
country
which
we
still
possess
is
to
make
them
partakers
in
the
government
at
the
present
time
civic
zeal
seems
to
me
to
be
inseparable
from
the
exercise
of
political
rights
and
i
hold
that
the
number
of
citizens
will
be
found
to
augment
or
decrease
in
europe
in
proportion
as
those
rights
are
extended
in
the
united
states
the
inhabitants
were
thrown
but
as
yesterday
upon
the
soil
which
they
now
occupy
and
they
brought
neither
customs
nor
traditions
with
them
there
they
meet
each
other
for
the
first
time
with
no
previous
acquaintance
in
short
the
instinctive
love
of
their
country
can
scarcely
exist
in
their
minds
but
every
one
takes
as
zealous
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
his
township
his
country
and
of
the
whole
state
as
if
they
were
his
own
because
every
one
in
his
sphere
takes
an
active
part
in
the
government
of
society
the
lower
orders
in
the
united
states
are
alive
to
the
perception
of
the
influence
exercised
by
the
general
prosperity
upon
their
own
welfare
and
simple
as
this
observation
is
it
is
one
which
is
but
too
rarely
made
by
the
people
but
in
america
the
people
regard
this
prosperity
as
the
result
of
its
own
exertions
the
citizen
looks
upon
the
fortune
of
the
public
as
his
private
interest
and
he
in
its
success
not
so
much
from
a
sense
of
pride
or
of
duty
as
from
what
i
shall
venture
to
term
cupidity
it
is
unnecessary
to
study
the
institutions
and
the
history
of
the
americans
in
order
to
discover
the
truth
of
this
remark
for
their
manners
render
it
sufficiently
evident
as
the
american
participates
in
all
that
is
done
in
his
country
he
thinks
himself
obliged
to
defend
whatever
may
be
censured
for
it
is
not
only
his
country
which
is
attacked
upon
these
occasions
but
it
is
himself
the
consequence
is
that
his
national
pride
resorts
to
a
thousand
artifices
and
to
all
the
petty
tricks
of
individual
vanity
nothing
is
more
embarrassing
in
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
life
than
this
irritable
patriotism
of
the
americans
a
stranger
may
be
well
inclined
to
praise
many
of
the
institutions
of
their
country
but
he
begs
permission
to
blame
some
of
the
peculiarities
which
he
observes
a
permission
which
is
however
inexorably
refused
america
is
therefore
a
free
country
in
which
lest
anybody
should
be
hurt
by
your
remarks
you
are
not
allowed
to
speak
freely
of
private
individuals
or
of
the
state
of
the
citizens
or
of
the
authorities
of
public
or
of
private
undertakings
or
in
short
of
anything
at
all
except
it
be
of
the
climate
and
the
soil
and
even
then
americans
will
be
found
ready
to
defend
either
the
one
or
the
other
as
if
they
had
been
contrived
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
in
our
times
option
must
be
made
between
the
patriotism
of
all
and
the
government
of
a
few
for
the
force
and
activity
which
the
first
confers
are
irreconcilable
with
the
guarantees
of
tranquillity
which
the
second
furnishes
notion
of
rights
in
the
united
states
no
great
people
without
a
notion
of
how
the
notion
of
rights
can
be
given
to
a
respect
of
rights
in
the
united
whence
it
arises
after
the
idea
of
virtue
i
am
acquainted
with
no
higher
principle
than
that
of
right
or
to
speak
more
accurately
these
two
ideas
are
commingled
in
one
the
idea
of
right
is
simply
that
of
virtue
introduced
into
the
political
world
it
is
the
idea
of
right
which
enabled
men
to
define
anarchy
and
tyranny
and
which
taught
them
to
remain
independent
without
arrogance
as
well
as
to
obey
without
servility
the
man
who
submits
to
violence
is
debased
by
his
compliance
but
when
he
obeys
the
mandate
of
one
who
possesses
that
right
of
authority
which
he
acknowledges
in
a
fellow
creature
he
rises
in
some
measure
above
the
person
who
delivers
the
command
there
are
no
great
men
without
virtue
and
there
are
no
great
nations
it
may
also
be
added
that
there
would
be
no
society
without
the
notion
of
rights
for
what
is
the
condition
of
a
mass
of
rational
and
intelligent
beings
who
are
only
united
together
by
the
bond
of
force
i
am
persuaded
that
the
only
means
which
we
possess
at
the
present
time
of
inculcating
the
notion
of
rights
and
of
rendering
it
as
it
were
palpable
to
the
senses
is
to
invest
all
the
members
of
the
community
with
the
peaceful
exercise
of
certain
rights
this
is
very
clearly
seen
in
children
who
are
men
without
the
strength
and
the
experience
of
manhood
when
a
child
begins
to
move
in
the
midst
of
the
objects
which
surround
him
he
is
instinctively
led
to
turn
everything
which
he
can
lay
his
hands
upon
to
his
own
purpose
he
has
no
notion
of
the
property
of
others
but
as
he
gradually
learns
the
value
of
things
and
begins
to
perceive
that
he
may
in
his
turn
be
deprived
of
his
possessions
he
becomes
more
circumspect
and
he
observes
those
rights
in
others
which
he
wishes
to
have
respected
in
himself
the
principle
which
the
child
derives
from
the
possession
of
his
toys
is
taught
to
the
man
by
the
objects
which
he
may
call
his
own
in
america
those
complaints
against
property
in
general
which
are
so
frequent
in
europe
are
never
heard
because
in
america
there
are
no
paupers
and
as
every
one
has
property
of
his
own
to
defend
every
one
recognizes
the
principle
upon
which
he
holds
it
the
same
thing
occurs
in
the
political
world
in
america
the
lowest
classes
have
conceived
a
very
high
notion
of
political
rights
because
they
exercise
those
rights
and
they
refrain
from
attacking
those
of
other
people
in
order
to
ensure
their
own
from
attack
while
in
europe
the
same
classes
sometimes
recalcitrate
even
against
the
supreme
power
the
american
submits
without
a
murmur
to
the
authority
of
the
pettiest
magistrate
this
truth
is
exemplified
by
the
most
trivial
details
of
national
peculiarities
in
france
very
few
pleasures
are
exclusively
reserved
for
the
higher
classes
the
poor
are
admitted
wherever
the
rich
are
received
and
they
consequently
behave
with
propriety
and
respect
whatever
contributes
to
the
enjoyments
in
which
they
themselves
participate
in
england
where
wealth
has
a
monopoly
of
amusement
as
well
as
of
power
complaints
are
made
that
whenever
the
poor
happen
to
steal
into
the
enclosures
which
are
reserved
for
the
pleasures
of
the
rich
they
commit
acts
of
wanton
mischief
can
this
be
wondered
at
since
care
has
been
taken
that
they
should
have
nothing
to
lose
the
government
of
the
democracy
brings
the
notion
of
political
rights
to
the
level
of
the
humblest
citizens
just
as
the
dissemination
of
wealth
brings
the
notion
of
property
within
the
reach
of
all
the
members
of
the
community
and
i
confess
that
to
my
mind
this
is
one
of
its
greatest
advantages
i
do
not
assert
that
it
is
easy
to
teach
men
to
exercise
political
rights
but
i
maintain
that
when
it
is
possible
the
effects
which
result
from
it
are
highly
important
and
i
add
that
if
there
ever
was
a
time
at
which
such
an
attempt
ought
to
be
made
that
time
is
our
own
it
is
clear
that
the
influence
of
religious
belief
is
shaken
and
that
the
notion
of
divine
rights
is
declining
it
is
evident
that
public
morality
is
vitiated
and
the
notion
of
moral
rights
is
also
disappearing
these
are
general
symptoms
of
the
substitution
of
argument
for
faith
and
of
calculation
for
the
impulses
of
sentiment
if
in
the
midst
of
this
general
disruption
you
do
not
succeed
in
connecting
the
notion
of
rights
with
that
of
personal
interest
which
is
the
only
immutable
point
in
the
human
heart
what
means
will
you
have
of
governing
the
world
except
by
fear
when
i
am
told
that
since
the
laws
are
weak
and
the
populace
is
wild
since
passions
are
excited
and
the
authority
of
virtue
is
paralyzed
no
measures
must
be
taken
to
increase
the
rights
of
the
democracy
i
reply
that
it
is
for
these
very
reasons
that
some
measures
of
the
kind
must
be
taken
and
i
am
persuaded
that
governments
are
still
more
interested
in
taking
them
than
society
at
large
because
governments
are
liable
to
be
destroyed
and
society
can
not
perish
i
am
not
however
inclined
to
exaggerate
the
example
which
america
furnishes
in
those
states
the
people
was
invested
with
political
rights
at
a
time
when
they
could
scarcely
be
abused
for
the
citizens
were
few
in
number
and
simple
in
their
manners
as
they
have
increased
the
americans
have
not
augmented
the
power
of
the
democracy
but
they
have
if
i
may
use
the
expression
extended
its
dominions
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
moment
at
which
political
rights
are
granted
to
a
people
that
had
before
been
without
them
is
a
very
critical
though
it
be
a
very
necessary
one
a
child
may
kill
before
he
is
aware
of
the
value
of
life
and
he
may
deprive
another
person
of
his
property
before
he
is
aware
that
his
own
may
be
taken
away
from
him
the
lower
orders
when
first
they
are
invested
with
political
rights
stand
in
relation
to
those
rights
in
the
same
position
as
a
child
does
to
the
whole
of
nature
and
the
celebrated
adage
may
then
be
applied
to
them
puer
this
truth
may
even
be
perceived
in
america
the
states
in
which
the
citizens
have
enjoyed
their
rights
longest
are
those
in
which
they
make
the
best
use
of
them
it
can
not
be
repeated
too
often
that
nothing
is
more
fertile
in
prodigies
than
the
art
of
being
free
but
there
is
nothing
more
arduous
than
the
apprenticeship
of
liberty
such
is
not
the
case
with
despotic
institutions
despotism
often
promises
to
make
amends
for
a
thousand
previous
ills
it
supports
the
right
it
protects
the
oppressed
and
it
maintains
public
order
the
nation
is
lulled
by
the
temporary
prosperity
which
accrues
to
it
until
it
is
roused
to
a
sense
of
its
own
misery
liberty
on
the
contrary
is
generally
established
in
the
midst
of
agitation
it
is
perfected
by
civil
discord
and
its
benefits
can
not
be
appreciated
until
it
is
already
old
respect
for
the
law
in
the
united
states
respect
of
the
americans
for
the
parental
affection
which
they
entertain
for
personal
interest
of
every
one
to
increase
the
authority
of
the
law
it
is
not
always
feasible
to
consult
the
whole
people
either
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
formation
of
the
law
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
when
such
a
measure
is
possible
the
authority
of
the
law
is
very
much
augmented
this
popular
origin
which
impairs
the
excellence
and
the
wisdom
of
legislation
contributes
prodigiously
to
increase
its
power
there
is
an
amazing
strength
in
the
expression
of
the
determination
of
a
whole
people
and
when
it
declares
itself
the
imagination
of
those
who
are
most
inclined
to
contest
it
is
overawed
by
its
authority
the
truth
of
this
fact
is
very
well
known
by
parties
and
they
consequently
strive
to
make
out
a
majority
whenever
they
can
if
they
have
not
the
greater
number
of
voters
on
their
side
they
assert
that
the
true
majority
abstained
from
voting
and
if
they
are
foiled
even
there
they
have
recourse
to
the
body
of
those
persons
who
had
no
votes
to
give
in
the
united
states
except
slaves
servants
and
paupers
in
the
receipt
of
relief
from
the
townships
there
is
no
class
of
persons
who
do
not
exercise
the
elective
franchise
and
who
do
not
contribute
indirectly
to
make
the
laws
those
who
design
to
attack
the
laws
must
consequently
either
modify
the
opinion
of
the
nation
or
trample
upon
its
decision
a
second
reason
which
is
still
more
weighty
may
be
farther
adduced
in
the
united
states
every
one
is
personally
interested
in
enforcing
the
obedience
of
the
whole
community
to
the
law
for
as
the
minority
may
shortly
rally
the
majority
to
its
principles
it
is
interested
in
professing
that
respect
for
the
decrees
of
the
legislator
which
it
may
soon
have
occasion
to
claim
for
its
own
however
irksome
an
enactment
may
be
the
citizen
of
the
united
states
complies
with
it
not
only
because
it
is
the
work
of
the
majority
but
because
it
originates
in
his
own
authority
and
he
regards
it
as
a
contract
to
which
he
is
himself
a
party
in
the
united
states
then
that
numerous
and
turbulent
multitude
does
not
exist
which
always
looks
upon
the
law
as
its
natural
enemy
and
accordingly
surveys
it
with
fear
and
with
distrust
it
is
impossible
on
the
other
hand
not
to
perceive
that
all
classes
display
the
utmost
reliance
upon
the
legislation
of
their
country
and
that
they
are
attached
to
it
by
a
kind
of
parental
affection
i
am
wrong
however
in
saying
all
classes
for
as
in
america
the
european
scale
of
authority
is
inverted
the
wealthy
are
there
placed
in
a
position
analogous
to
that
of
the
poor
in
the
old
world
and
it
is
the
opulent
classes
which
frequently
look
upon
the
law
with
suspicion
i
have
already
observed
that
the
advantage
of
democracy
is
not
as
has
been
sometimes
asserted
that
it
protects
the
interests
of
the
whole
community
but
simply
that
it
protects
those
of
the
majority
in
the
united
states
where
the
poor
rule
the
rich
have
always
some
reason
to
dread
the
abuses
of
their
power
this
natural
anxiety
of
the
rich
may
produce
a
sullen
dissatisfaction
but
society
is
not
disturbed
by
it
for
the
same
reason
which
induces
the
rich
to
withhold
their
confidence
in
the
legislative
authority
makes
them
obey
its
mandates
their
wealth
which
prevents
them
from
making
the
law
prevents
them
from
withstanding
it
among
civilized
nations
revolts
are
rarely
excited
except
by
such
persons
as
have
nothing
to
lose
by
them
and
if
the
laws
of
a
democracy
are
not
always
worthy
of
respect
at
least
they
always
obtain
it
for
those
who
usually
infringe
the
laws
have
no
excuse
for
not
complying
with
the
enactments
they
have
themselves
made
and
by
which
they
are
themselves
benefited
while
the
citizens
whose
interests
might
be
promoted
by
the
infraction
of
them
are
induced
by
their
character
and
their
station
to
submit
to
the
decisions
of
the
legislature
whatever
they
may
be
beside
which
the
people
in
america
obeys
the
law
not
only
because
it
emanates
from
the
popular
authority
but
because
that
authority
may
modify
it
in
any
points
which
may
prove
vexatory
a
law
is
observed
because
it
is
a
evil
in
the
first
place
and
an
evil
of
transient
duration
in
the
second
activity
which
pervades
all
the
branches
of
the
body
politic
in
the
united
states
influence
which
it
exercises
upon
society
more
difficult
to
conceive
the
political
activity
which
pervades
the
united
states
than
the
freedom
and
equality
which
reign
the
great
activity
which
perpetually
agitates
the
legislative
bodies
is
only
an
episode
to
the
general
difficult
for
an
american
to
confine
himself
to
his
own
political
agitation
extends
to
all
social
commercial
activity
of
the
americans
partly
attributable
to
this
indirect
advantages
which
society
derives
from
a
democratic
government
on
passing
from
a
country
in
which
free
institutions
are
established
to
one
where
they
do
not
exist
the
traveller
is
struck
by
the
change
in
the
former
all
is
bustle
and
activity
in
the
latter
everything
is
calm
and
motionless
in
the
one
melioration
and
progress
are
the
general
topics
of
inquiry
in
the
other
it
seems
as
if
the
community
only
aspired
to
repose
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
advantages
which
it
has
acquired
nevertheless
the
country
which
exerts
itself
so
strenuously
to
promote
its
welfare
is
generally
more
wealthy
and
more
prosperous
than
that
which
appears
to
be
so
contented
with
its
lot
and
when
we
compare
them
together
we
can
scarcely
conceive
how
so
many
new
wants
are
daily
felt
in
the
former
while
so
few
seem
to
occur
in
the
latter
if
this
remark
is
applicable
to
those
free
countries
in
which
monarchical
and
aristocratic
institutions
subsist
it
is
still
more
striking
with
regard
to
democratic
republics
in
these
states
it
is
not
only
a
portion
of
the
people
which
is
busied
with
the
melioration
of
its
social
condition
but
the
whole
community
is
engaged
in
the
task
and
it
is
not
the
exigencies
and
the
convenience
of
a
single
class
for
which
a
provision
is
to
be
made
but
the
exigencies
and
the
convenience
of
all
ranks
of
life
it
is
not
impossible
to
conceive
the
surpassing
liberty
which
the
americans
enjoy
some
idea
may
likewise
be
formed
of
the
extreme
equality
which
subsists
among
them
but
the
political
activity
which
pervades
the
united
states
must
be
seen
in
order
to
be
understood
no
sooner
do
you
set
foot
upon
the
american
soil
than
you
are
stunned
by
a
kind
of
tumult
a
confused
clamor
is
heard
on
every
side
and
a
thousand
simultaneous
voices
demand
the
immediate
satisfaction
of
their
social
wants
everything
is
in
motion
around
you
here
the
people
of
one
quarter
of
a
town
are
met
to
decide
upon
the
building
of
a
church
there
the
election
of
a
representative
is
going
on
a
little
further
the
delegates
of
a
district
are
posting
to
the
town
in
order
to
consult
upon
some
local
improvements
or
in
another
place
the
laborers
of
a
village
quit
their
ploughs
to
deliberate
upon
the
project
of
a
road
or
a
public
school
meetings
are
called
for
the
sole
purpose
of
declaring
their
disapprobation
of
the
line
of
conduct
pursued
by
the
government
while
in
other
assemblies
the
citizens
salute
the
authorities
of
the
day
as
the
fathers
of
their
country
societies
are
formed
which
regard
drunkenness
as
the
principal
cause
of
the
evils
under
which
the
state
labors
and
which
solemnly
bind
themselves
to
give
a
constant
example
of
temperance
the
great
political
agitation
of
the
american
legislative
bodies
which
is
the
only
kind
of
excitement
that
attracts
the
attention
of
foreign
countries
is
a
mere
episode
or
a
sort
of
continuation
of
that
universal
movement
which
originates
in
the
lowest
classes
of
the
people
and
extends
successively
to
all
the
ranks
of
society
it
is
impossible
to
spend
more
efforts
in
the
pursuit
of
enjoyment
the
cares
of
political
life
engross
a
most
prominent
place
in
the
occupation
of
a
citizen
in
the
united
states
and
almost
the
only
pleasure
of
which
an
american
has
any
idea
is
to
take
a
part
in
the
government
and
to
discuss
the
part
he
has
taken
this
feeling
pervades
the
most
trifling
habits
of
life
even
the
women
frequently
attend
public
meetings
and
listen
to
political
harangues
as
a
recreation
after
their
household
labors
debating
clubs
are
to
a
certain
extent
a
substitute
for
theatrical
entertainments
an
american
can
not
converse
but
he
can
discuss
and
when
he
attempts
to
talk
he
falls
into
a
dissertation
he
speaks
to
you
as
if
he
were
addressing
a
meeting
and
if
he
should
warm
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
he
will
infallibly
say
gentlemen
to
the
person
with
whom
he
is
conversing
in
some
countries
the
inhabitants
display
a
certain
repugnance
to
avail
themselves
of
the
political
privileges
with
which
the
law
invests
them
it
would
seem
that
they
set
too
high
a
value
upon
their
time
to
spend
it
on
the
interests
of
the
community
and
they
prefer
to
withdraw
within
the
exact
limits
of
a
wholesome
egotism
marked
out
by
four
sunk
fences
and
a
quickset
hedge
but
if
an
american
were
condemned
to
confine
his
activity
to
his
own
affairs
he
would
be
robbed
of
one
half
of
his
existence
he
would
feel
an
immense
void
in
the
life
which
he
is
accustomed
to
lead
and
his
wretchedness
would
be
unbearable
i
am
persuaded
that
if
ever
a
despotic
government
is
established
in
america
it
will
find
it
more
difficult
to
surmount
the
habits
which
free
institutions
have
engendered
than
to
conquer
the
attachment
of
the
citizens
to
freedom
this
ceaseless
agitation
which
democratic
government
has
introduced
into
the
political
world
influences
all
social
intercourse
i
am
not
sure
that
upon
the
whole
this
is
not
the
greatest
advantage
of
democracy
and
i
am
much
less
inclined
to
applaud
it
for
what
it
does
than
for
what
it
causes
to
be
done
it
is
incontestable
that
the
people
frequently
conducts
public
business
very
ill
but
it
is
impossible
that
the
lower
orders
should
take
a
part
in
public
business
without
extending
the
circle
of
their
ideas
and
without
quitting
the
ordinary
routine
of
their
mental
acquirements
the
humblest
individual
who
is
called
upon
to
in
the
government
of
society
acquires
a
certain
degree
of
and
as
he
possesses
authority
he
can
command
the
services
of
minds
much
more
enlightened
than
his
own
he
is
canvassed
by
a
multitude
of
applicants
who
seek
to
deceive
him
in
a
thousand
different
ways
but
who
instruct
him
by
their
deceit
he
takes
a
part
in
political
undertakings
which
did
not
originate
in
his
own
conception
but
which
give
him
a
taste
for
undertakings
of
the
kind
new
meliorations
are
daily
pointed
out
in
the
property
which
he
holds
in
common
with
others
and
this
gives
him
the
desire
of
improving
that
property
which
is
more
peculiarly
his
own
he
is
perhaps
neither
happier
nor
better
than
those
who
came
before
him
but
he
is
better
informed
and
more
active
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
democratic
institutions
of
the
united
states
joined
to
the
physical
constitution
of
the
country
are
the
cause
not
the
direct
as
is
so
often
asserted
but
the
indirect
cause
of
the
prodigious
commercial
activity
of
the
inhabitants
it
is
not
engendered
by
the
laws
but
the
people
learns
how
to
promote
it
by
the
experience
derived
from
legislation
when
the
opponents
of
democracy
assert
that
a
single
individual
performs
the
duties
which
he
undertakes
much
better
than
the
government
of
the
community
it
appears
to
me
that
they
are
perfectly
right
the
government
of
an
individual
supposing
an
equality
of
instruction
on
either
side
is
more
consistent
more
persevering
and
more
accurate
than
that
of
a
multitude
and
it
is
much
better
qualified
judiciously
to
discriminate
the
characters
of
the
men
it
employs
if
any
deny
what
i
advance
they
have
certainly
never
seen
a
democratic
government
or
have
formed
their
opinion
upon
very
partial
evidence
it
is
true
that
even
when
local
circumstances
and
the
disposition
of
the
people
allow
democratic
institutions
to
subsist
they
never
display
a
regular
and
methodical
system
of
government
democratic
liberty
is
far
from
accomplishing
all
the
projects
it
undertakes
with
the
skill
of
an
adroit
despotism
it
frequently
abandons
them
before
they
have
borne
their
fruits
or
risks
them
when
the
consequences
may
prove
dangerous
but
in
the
end
it
produces
more
than
any
absolute
government
and
if
it
do
fewer
things
well
it
does
a
great
number
of
things
under
its
sway
the
transactions
of
the
public
administration
are
not
nearly
so
important
as
what
is
done
by
private
exertion
democracy
does
not
confer
the
most
skilful
kind
of
government
upon
the
people
but
it
produces
that
which
the
most
skilful
governments
are
frequently
unable
to
awaken
namely
an
and
restless
activity
a
superabundant
force
and
an
energy
which
is
inseparable
from
it
and
which
may
under
favorable
circumstances
beget
the
most
amazing
benefits
these
are
the
true
advantages
of
democracy
in
the
present
age
when
the
destinies
of
christendom
seem
to
be
in
suspense
some
hasten
to
assail
democracy
as
its
foe
while
it
is
yet
in
its
early
growth
and
others
are
ready
with
their
vows
of
adoration
for
this
new
duty
which
is
springing
forth
from
chaos
but
both
parties
are
very
imperfectly
acquainted
with
the
object
of
their
hatred
or
of
their
desires
they
strike
in
the
dark
and
distribute
their
blows
by
mere
chance
we
must
first
understand
what
the
purport
of
society
and
the
aim
of
government
are
held
to
be
if
it
be
your
intention
to
confer
a
certain
elevation
upon
the
human
mind
and
to
teach
it
to
regard
the
things
of
this
world
with
generous
feelings
to
inspire
men
with
a
scorn
of
mere

to

to
cultivate
the
arts
of
a

you
must

which
would
be

if
instead
of
living
in

state
of

you
are
contented
to
have
prosperity
around
you
if
in
short
you
are
of
opinion
that
the

is
not
to
confer
the
greatest
possible
share
of
power
and
of
glory
upon
the

to
ensure
the
greatest
degree
of
enjoyment
and
the
least
degree
of
misery
to
each
of
the
individuals
who
compose
it
if
such
be
your
desires
you
can
have
no
surer
means
of
satisfying
them
than
by
equalizing
the
condition
of

and
establishing
democratic
institutions

if

past
at
which
such
a

was

if
some
superhuman
power
impel
us
toward
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
governments
without
consulting
our
wishes
let
us
at
least
endeavor
to
make
the
best
of
that
which
is
allotted
to
us
and
let
us
so
inquire
into
its
good
and
its
evil
propensities
as
to
be
able
to
foster
the
former
and
repress
the
latter
to
the
utmost
notes
at
the
time
of
my
stay
in
the
united
states
the
temperance
societies
already
consisted
of
more
than

their
effect
had
been
to
diminish
the
consumption
of

liquors
by

chapter

unlimited
power
of
the
majority
in
the
united
states
and
its
consequences
natural
strength
of
the
majority
in
most
of
the
american
constitutions
have
increased
this
strength
by
artificial
how
this
has
been
pledged
moral
power
of
the
opinions
as
to
its
respect
for
its
rights
how
augmented
in
the
united
states
the
very
essence
of
democratic
government
consists
in
the
absolute
sovereignty
of
the
majority
for
there
is
nothing
in
democratic
states
which
is
capable
of
resisting
it
most
of
the
american
constitutions
have
sought
to
increase
this
natural
strength
of
the
majority
by
artificial
means
the
legislature
is
of
all
political
institutions
the
one
which
is
most
easily
swayed
by
the
wishes
of
the
majority
the
americans
determined
that
the
members
of
the
legislature
should
be
elected
by
the
people
immediately
and
for
a
very
brief
term
in
order
to
subject
them
not
only
to
the
general
convictions
but
even
to
the
daily
passions
of
their
constituents
the
members
of
both
houses
are
taken
from
the
same
class
in
society
and
are
nominated
in
the
same
manner
so
that
the
modifications
of
the
legislative
bodies
are
almost
as
rapid
and
quite
as
irresistible
as
those
of
a
single
assembly
it
is
to
a
legislature
thus
constituted
that
almost
all
the
authority
of
the
government
has
been
intrusted
but
while
the
law
increased
the
strength
of
those
authorities
which
of
themselves
were
strong
it
enfeebled
more
and
more
those
which
were
naturally
weak
it
deprived
the
representatives
of
the
executive
of
all
stability
and
independence
and
by
subjecting
them
completely
to
the
caprices
of
the
legislature
it
robbed
them
completely
of
the
slender
influence
which
the
nature
of
a
democratic
government
might
have
allowed
them
to
retain
in
several
states
the
judicial
power
was
also
submitted
to
the
elective
discretion
of
the
majority
and
in
all
of
them
its
existence
was
made
to
depend
on
the
pleasure
of
the
legislative
authority
since
the
representatives
were
empowered
annually
to
regulate
the
stipend
of
the
judges
custom
however
has
done
even
more
than
law
a
proceeding
which
will
in
the
end
set
all
the
guarantees
of
representative
government
at
naught
is
becoming
more
and
more
general
in
the
united
states
it
frequently
happens
that
the
electors
who
choose
a
delegate
point
out
a
certain
line
of
conduct
to
him
and
impose
upon
him
a
certain
number
of
positive
obligations
which
he
is
pledged
to
fulfil
with
the
exception
of
the
tumult
this
comes
to
the
same
thing
as
if
the
majority
of
the
populace
held
its
deliberations
in
the
several
other
circumstances
concur
in
rendering
the
power
of
the
majority
in
america
not
only
preponderant
but
irresistible
the
moral
authority
of
the
majority
is
partly
based
upon
the
notion
that
there
is
more
intelligence
and
more
wisdom
in
a
great
number
of
men
collected
together
than
in
a
single
individual
and
that
the
quantity
of
legislators
is
more
important
than
their
quality
the
theory
of
equality
is
in
fact
applied
to
the
intellect
of
man
and
human
pride
is
thus
assailed
in
its
last
retreat
by
a
doctrine
which
the
minority
hesitate
to
admit
and
in
which
they
very
slowly
concur
like
all
other
powers
and
perhaps
more
than
all
other
powers
the
authority
of
the
many
requires
the
sanction
of
time
at
first
it
enforces
obedience
by
constraint
but
its
laws
are
not
respected
until
they
have
long
been
maintained
the
right
of
governing
society
which
the
majority
supposes
itself
to
derive
from
its
superior
intelligence
was
introduced
into
the
united
states
by
the
first
settlers
and
this
idea
which
would
be
sufficient
of
itself
to
create
a
free
nation
has
now
been
amalgamated
with
the
manners
of
the
people
and
the
minor
incidents
of
social
intercourse
the
french
under
the
old
monarchy
held
it
for
a
maxim
which
is
still
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
english
constitution
that
the
king
could
do
no
wrong
and
if
he
did
wrong
the
blame
was
imputed
to
his
advisers
this
notion
was
highly
favorable
to
habits
of
obedience
and
it
enabled
the
subject
to
complain
of
the
law
without
ceasing
to
love
and
honor
the
lawgiver
the
americans
entertain
the
same
opinion
with
respect
to
the
majority
the
moral
power
of
the
majority
is
founded
upon
yet
another
principle
which
is
that
the
interests
of
the
many
are
to
be
preferred
to
those
of
the
few
it
will
readily
be
perceived
that
the
respect
here
professed
for
the
rights
of
the
majority
must
naturally
increase
or
diminish
according
to
the
state
of
parties
when
a
nation
is
divided
into
several
irreconcilable
factions
the
privilege
of
the
majority
is
often
overlooked
because
it
is
intolerable
to
comply
with
its
demands
if
there
existed
in
america
a
class
of
citizens
whom
the
legislating
majority
sought
to
deprive
of
exclusive
privileges
which
they
had
possessed
for
ages
and
to
bring
down
from
an
elevated
station
to
the
level
of
the
ranks
of
the
multitude
it
is
probable
that
the
minority
would
be
less
ready
to
comply
with
its
laws
but
as
the
united
states
were
colonized
by
men
holding
an
equal
rank
among
themselves
there
is
as
yet
no
natural
or
permanent
source
of
dissension
between
the
interests
of
its
different
inhabitants
there
are
certain
communities
in
which
the
persons
who
constitute
the
minority
can
never
hope
to
draw
over
the
majority
to
their
side
because
they
must
then
give
up
the
very
point
which
is
at
issue
between
them
thus
an
aristocracy
can
never
become
a
majority
while
it
retains
its
exclusive
privileges
and
it
can
not
cede
its
privileges
without
ceasing
to
be
an
aristocracy
in
the
united
states
political
questions
can
not
be
taken
up
in
so
general
and
absolute
a
manner
and
all
parties
are
willing
to
recognize
the
rights
of
the
majority
because
they
all
hope
to
turn
those
rights
to
their
own
advantage
at
some
future
time
the
majority
therefore
in
that
country
exercises
a
prodigious
actual
authority
and
a
moral
influence
which
is
scarcely
less
preponderant
no
obstacles
exist
which
can
impede
or
so
much
as
retard
its
progress
or
which
can
induce
it
to
heed
the
complaints
of
those
whom
it
crushes
upon
its
path
this
state
of
things
is
fatal
in
itself
and
dangerous
for
the
future
how
the
unlimited
power
of
the
majority
increases
in
america
the
instability
of
legislation
and
the
administration
inherent
in
democracy
the
americans
increase
the
mutability
of
the
laws
which
is
inherent
in
democracy
by
changing
the
legislature
every
year
and
by
vesting
it
with
unbounded
the
same
effect
is
produced
upon
the
in
america
social
melioration
is
conducted
more
energetically
but
less
perseveringly
than
in
europe
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
natural
defects
of
democratic
institutions
and
they
all
of
them
increase
in
the
exact
ratio
of
the
power
of
the
majority
to
begin
with
the
most
evident
of
them
all
the
mutability
of
the
laws
is
an
evil
inherent
in
democratic
government
because
it
is
natural
to
democracies
to
raise
men
to
power
in
very
rapid
succession
but
this
evil
is
more
or
less
sensible
in
proportion
to
the
authority
and
the
means
of
action
which
the
legislature
possesses
in
america
the
authority
exercised
by
the
legislative
bodies
is
supreme
nothing
prevents
them
from
accomplishing
their
wishes
with
celerity
and
with
irresistible
power
while
they
are
supplied
by
new
representatives
every
year
that
is
to
say
the
circumstances
which
contribute
most
powerfully
to
democratic
instability
and
which
admit
of
the
free
application
of
caprice
to
every
object
in
the
state
are
here
in
full
operation
in
conformity
with
this
principle
america
is
at
the
present
day
the
country
in
the
world
where
laws
last
the
shortest
time
almost
all
the
american
constitutions
have
been
amended
within
the
course
of
thirty
years
there
is
therefore
not
a
single
american
state
which
has
not
modified
the
principles
of
its
legislation
in
that
lapse
of
time
as
for
the
laws
themselves
a
single
glance
upon
the
archives
of
the
different
states
of
the
union
suffices
to
convince
one
that
in
america
the
activity
of
the
legislator
never
slackens
not
that
the
american
democracy
is
naturally
less
stable
than
any
other
but
that
it
is
allowed
to
follow
its
capricious
propensities
in
the
formation
of
the
laws
the
omnipotence
of
the
majority
and
the
rapid
as
well
as
absolute
manner
in
which
its
decisions
are
executed
in
the
united
states
have
not
only
the
effect
of
rendering
the
law
unstable
but
they
exercise
the
same
influence
upon
the
execution
of
the
law
and
the
conduct
of
the
public
administration
as
the
majority
is
the
only
power
which
it
is
important
to
court
all
its
projects
are
taken
up
with
the
greatest
ardor
but
no
sooner
is
its
attention
distracted
than
all
this
ardor
ceases
while
in
the
free
states
of
europe
the
administration
is
at
once
independent
and
secure
so
that
the
projects
of
the
legislature
are
put
into
execution
although
its
immediate
attention
may
be
directed
to
other
objects
in
america
certain
meliorations
are
undertaken
with
much
more
zeal
and
activity
than
elsewhere
in
europe
the
same
ends
are
promoted
by
much
less
social
effort
more
continuously
applied
some
years
ago
several
pious
individuals
undertook
to
meliorate
the
condition
of
the
prisons
the
public
was
excited
by
the
statements
which
they
put
forward
and
the
regeneration
of
criminals
became
a
very
popular
undertaking
new
prisons
were
built
and
for
the
first
time
the
idea
of
reforming
as
well
as
of
punishing
the
delinquent
formed
a
part
of
prison
discipline
but
this
happy
alteration
in
which
the
public
had
taken
so
hearty
an
interest
and
which
the
exertions
of
the
citizens
had
irresistibly
accelerated
could
not
be
completed
in
a
moment
while
the
new
penitentiaries
were
being
erected
and
it
was
the
pleasure
of
the
majority
they
should
be
terminated
with
all
possible
celerity
the
old
prisons
existed
which
still
contained
a
great
number
of
offenders
these
jails
became
more
unwholesome
and
more
corrupt
in
proportion
as
the
new
establishments
were
beautified
and
improved
forming
a
contrast
which
may
readily
be
understood
the
majority
was
so
eagerly
employed
in
founding
the
new
prisons
that
those
which
already
existed
were
forgotten
and
as
the
general
attention
was
diverted
to
a
novel
object
the
care
which
had
hitherto
been
bestowed
upon
the
others
ceased
the
salutary
regulations
of
discipline
were
first
relaxed
and
afterward
broken
so
that
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
a
prison
which
bore
witness
to
the
mild
and
enlightened
spirit
of
our
time
dungeons
might
be
met
with
which
reminded
the
visitor
of
the
barbarity
of
the
middle
ages
tyranny
of
the
majority
how
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
is
to
be
impossibility
of
conceiving
a
mixed
the
sovereign
power
must
centre
precautions
to
be
taken
to
control
its
these
precautions
have
not
been
taken
in
the
united
consequences
i
hold
it
to
be
an
impious
and
an
execrable
maxim
that
politically
speaking
a
people
has
a
right
to
do
whatsoever
it
pleases
and
yet
i
have
asserted
that
all
authority
originates
in
the
will
of
the
majority
am
i
then
in
contradiction
with
myself
a
general
law
which
bears
the
name
of
justice
has
been
made
and
sanctioned
not
only
by
a
majority
of
this
or
that
people
but
by
a
majority
of
mankind
the
rights
of
every
people
are
consequently
confined
within
the
limits
of
what
is
just
a
nation
may
be
considered
in
the
light
of
a
jury
which
is
empowered
to
represent
society
at
large
and
to
apply
the
great
and
general
law
of
justice
ought
such
a
jury
which
represents
society
to
have
more
power
than
the
society
in
which
the
laws
it
applies
originate
when
i
refuse
to
obey
an
unjust
law
i
do
not
contest
the
right
which
the
majority
has
of
commanding
but
i
simply
appeal
from
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
to
the
sovereignty
of
mankind
it
has
been
asserted
that
a
people
can
never
entirely
outstep
the
boundaries
of
justice
and
of
reason
in
those
affairs
which
are
more
peculiarly
its
own
and
that
consequently
full
power
may
fearlessly
be
given
to
the
majority
by
which
it
is
represented
but
this
language
is
that
of
a
slave
a
majority
taken
collectively
may
be
regarded
as
a
being
whose
opinions
and
most
frequently
whose
interests
are
opposed
to
those
of
another
being
which
is
styled
a
minority
if
it
be
admitted
that
a
man
possessing
absolute
power
may
misuse
that
power
by
wronging
his
adversaries
why
should
a
majority
not
be
liable
to
the
same
reproach
men
are
not
apt
to
change
their
characters
by
agglomeration
nor
does
their
patience
in
the
presence
of
obstacles
increase
with
the
consciousness
of
their
strength
and
for
these
reasons
i
can
never
willingly
invest
any
number
of
my
with
that
unlimited
authority
which
i
should
refuse
to
any
one
of
them
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
combine
several
principles
in
the
same
government
so
as
at
the
same
time
to
maintain
freedom
and
really
to
oppose
them
to
one
another
the
form
of
government
which
is
usually
termed
has
always
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
mere
chimera
accurately
speaking
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
mixed
government
with
the
meaning
usually
given
to
that
word
because
in
all
communities
some
one
principle
of
action
may
be
discovered
which
preponderates
over
the
others
england
in
the
last
century
which
has
been
more
especially
cited
as
an
example
of
this
form
of
government
was
in
point
of
fact
an
essentially
aristocratic
state
although
it
comprised
very
powerful
elements
of
democracy
for
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
country
were
such
that
the
aristocracy
could
not
but
preponderate
in
the
end
and
subject
the
direction
of
public
affairs
to
its
own
will
the
error
arose
from
too
much
attention
being
paid
to
the
actual
struggle
which
was
going
on
between
the
nobles
and
the
people
without
considering
the
probable
issue
of
the
contest
which
was
in
reality
the
important
point
when
a
community
really
has
a
mixed
government
that
is
to
say
when
it
is
equally
divided
between
two
adverse
principles
it
must
either
pass
through
a
revolution
or
fall
into
complete
dissolution
i
am
therefore
of
opinion
that
some
one
social
power
must
always
be
made
to
predominate
over
the
others
but
i
think
that
liberty
is
endangered
when
this
power
is
checked
by
no
obstacles
which
may
retard
its
course
and
force
it
to
moderate
its
own
vehemence
unlimited
power
is
in
itself
a
bad
and
dangerous
thing
human
beings
are
not
competent
to
exercise
it
with
discretion
and
god
alone
can
be
omnipotent
because
his
wisdom
and
his
justice
are
always
equal
to
his
power
but
no
power
upon
earth
is
so
worthy
of
honor
for
itself
or
of
reverential
obedience
to
the
rights
which
it
represents
that
i
would
consent
to
admit
its
uncontrolled
and
authority
when
i
see
that
the
right
and
the
means
of
absolute
command
are
conferred
on
a
people
or
upon
a
king
upon
an
aristocracy
or
a
democracy
a
monarchy
or
a
republic
i
recognize
the
germ
of
tyranny
and
i
journey
onward
to
a
land
of
more
hopeful
institutions
in
my
opinion
the
main
evil
of
the
present
democratic
institutions
of
the
united
states
does
not
arise
as
is
often
asserted
in
europe
from
their
weakness
but
from
their
overpowering
strength
and
i
am
not
so
much
alarmed
at
the
excessive
liberty
which
reigns
in
that
country
as
at
the
very
inadequate
securities
which
exist
against
tyranny
when
an
individual
or
a
party
is
wronged
in
the
united
states
to
whom
can
he
apply
for
redress
if
to
public
opinion
public
opinion
constitutes
the
majority
if
to
the
legislature
it
represents
the
majority
and
implicitly
obeys
its
instructions
if
to
the
executive
power
it
is
appointed
by
the
majority
and
is
a
passive
tool
in
its
hands
the
public
troops
consist
of
the
majority
under
arms
the
jury
is
the
majority
invested
with
the
right
of
hearing
judicial
cases
and
in
certain
states
even
the
judges
are
elected
by
the
majority
however
iniquitous
or
absurd
the
evil
of
which
you
complain
may
be
you
must
submit
to
it
as
well
as
you
can
if
on
the
other
hand
a
legislative
power
could
be
so
constituted
as
to
represent
the
majority
without
necessarily
being
the
slave
of
its
passions
an
executive
so
as
to
retain
a
certain
degree
of
uncontrolled
authority
and
a
judiciary
so
as
to
remain
independent
of
the
two
other
powers
a
government
would
be
formed
which
would
still
be
democratic
without
incurring
any
risk
of
tyrannical
abuse
i
do
not
say
that
tyrannical
abuses
frequently
occur
in
america
at
the
present
day
but
i
maintain
that
no
sure
barrier
is
established
against
them
and
that
the
causes
which
mitigate
the
government
are
to
be
found
in
the
circumstances
and
the
manners
of
the
country
more
than
its
laws
effects
of
the
unlimited
power
of
the
majority
upon
the
arbitrary
authority
of
the
american
public
officers
liberty
left
by
the
american
laws
to
public
officers
within
a
certain
their
power
a
distinction
must
be
drawn
between
tyranny
and
arbitrary
power
tyranny
may
be
exercised
by
means
of
the
law
and
in
that
case
it
is
not
arbitrary
arbitrary
power
may
be
exercised
for
the
good
of
the
community
at
large
in
which
case
it
is
not
tyrannical
tyranny
usually
employs
arbitrary
means
but
if
necessary
it
can
rule
without
them
in
the
united
states
the
unbounded
power
of
the
majority
which
is
favorable
to
the
legal
despotism
of
the
legislature
is
likewise
favorable
to
the
arbitrary
authority
of
the
magistrates
the
majority
has
an
entire
control
over
the
law
when
it
is
made
and
when
it
is
executed
and
as
it
possesses
an
equal
authority
over
those
who
are
in
power
and
the
community
at
large
it
considers
public
officers
as
its
passive
agents
and
readily
confides
the
task
of
serving
its
designs
to
their
vigilance
the
details
of
their
office
and
the
privileges
which
they
are
to
enjoy
are
rarely
defined
beforehand
but
the
majority
treats
them
as
a
master
does
his
servants
when
they
are
always
at
work
in
his
sight
and
he
has
the
power
of
directing
or
reprimanding
them
at
every
instant
in
general
the
american
functionaries
are
far
more
independent
than
the
french
civil
officers
within
the
sphere
which
is
prescribed
to
them
sometimes
even
they
are
allowed
by
the
popular
authority
to
exceed
those
bounds
and
as
they
are
protected
by
the
opinion
and
backed
by
the
cooperation
of
the
majority
they
venture
upon
such
manifestations
of
their
power
as
astonish
a
european
by
this
means
habits
are
formed
in
the
heart
of
a
free
country
which
may
some
day
prove
fatal
to
its
liberties
power

by
the
majority
in
america
upon
opinion
in

when
the
majority
has
once
irrevocably
decided
a
question
all
discussion
reason

moral
power
exercised
by
the
majority
upon
democratic
republics
have
deprived
despotism
of
its
physical
their
despotism
sways
the
minds
of
men
it
is
in
the
examination
of
the
display
of
public
opinion
in
the
united
states
that
we
clearly
perceive
how
far
the
power
of
the
majority
surpasses
all
the
powers
with
which
we
are
acquainted
in
europe
intellectual
principles
exercise
an
influence
which
is
so
invisible
and
often
so
inappreciable
that
they
baffle
the
toils
of
oppression
at
the
present
time
the
most
absolute
monarchs
in
europe
are
unable
to
prevent
certain
notions
which
are
opposed
to
their
authority
from
circulating
in
secret
throughout
their
dominions
and
even
in
their
courts
such
is
not
the
case
in
america
so
long
as
the
majority
is
still
undecided
discussion
is
carried
on
but
as
soon
as
its
decision
is
irrevocably
pronounced
a
submissive
silence
is
observed
and
the
friends
as
well
as
the
opponents
of
the
measure
unite
in
assenting
to
its
propriety
the
reason
of
this
is
perfectly
clear
no
monarch
is
so
absolute
as
to
combine
all
the
powers
of
society
in
his
own
hands
and
to
conquer
all
opposition
with
the
energy
of
a
majority
which
is
invested
with
the
right
of
making
and
of
executing
the
laws
the
authority
of
a
king
is
purely
physical
and
it
controls
the
actions
of
the
subject
without
subduing
his
private
will
but
the
majority
possesses
a
power
which
is
physical
and
moral
at
the
same
time
it
acts
upon
the
will
as
well
as
upon
the
actions
of
men
and
it
represses
not
only
all
contest
but
all
controversy
i
know
no
country
in
which
there
is
so
little
true
independence
of
mind
and
freedom
of
discussion
as
in
america
in
any
constitutional
state
in
europe
every
sort
of
religious
and
political
theory
may
be
advocated
and
propagated
abroad
for
there
is
no
country
in
europe
so
subdued
by
any
single
authority
as
not
to
contain
citizens
who
are
ready
to
protect
the
man
who
raises
his
voice
in
the
cause
of
truth
from
the
consequences
of
his
hardihood
if
he
is
unfortunate
enough
to
live
under
an
absolute
government
the
people
is
upon
his
side
if
he
inhabits
a
free
country
he
may
find
a
shelter
behind
the
authority
of
the
throne
if
he
require
one
the
aristocratic
part
of
society
supports
him
in
some
countries
and
the
democracy
in
others
but
in
a
nation
where
democratic
institutions
exist
organized
like
those
of
the
united
states
there
is
but
one
sole
authority
one
single
element
of
strength
and
success
with
nothing
beyond
it
in
america
the
majority
raises
very
formidable
barriers
to
the
liberty
of
opinion
within
these
barriers
an
author
may
write
whatever
he
pleases
but
he
will
repent
it
if
he
ever
step
beyond
them
not
that
he
is
exposed
to
the
terrors
of
an
but
he
is
tormented
by
the
slights
and
persecutions
of
daily
obloquy
his
political
career
is
closed
for
ever
since
he
has
offended
the
only
authority
which
is
able
to
promote
his
success
every
sort
of
compensation
even
that
of
celebrity
is
refused
to
him
before
he
published
his
opinions
he
imagined
that
he
held
them
in
common
with
many
others
but
no
sooner
has
he
declared
them
openly
than
he
is
loudly
censured
by
his
overbearing
opponents
while
those
who
think
without
having
the
courage
to
speak
like
him
abandon
him
in
silence
he
yields
at
length
oppressed
by
the
daily
efforts
he
has
been
making
and
he
subsides
into
silence
as
if
he
was
tormented
by
remorse
for
having
spoken
the
truth
fetters
and
headsmen
were
the
coarse
instruments
which
tyranny
formerly
employed
but
the
civilisation
of
our
age
has
refined
the
arts
of
despotism
which
seemed
however
to
have
been
sufficiently
perfected
before
the
excesses
of
monarchical
power
had
devised
a
variety
of
political
means
of
oppression
the
democratic
republics
of
the
present
day
have
rendered
it
as
entirely
an
affair
of
the
mind
as
that
will
which
it
is
intended
to
coerce
under
the
absolute
sway
of
an
individual
despot
the
body
was
attacked
in
order
to
subdue
the
soul
and
the
soul
escaped
the
blows
which
were
directed
against
it
and
rose
superior
to
the
attempt
but
such
is
not
the
course
adopted
by
tyranny
in
democratic
republics
there
the
body
is
left
free
and
the
soul
is
enslaved
the
sovereign
can
no
longer
say
you
shall
think
as
i
do
on
pain
of
death
but
he
says
you
are
free
to
think
differently
from
me
and
to
retain
your
life
your
property
and
all
that
you
possess
but
if
such
be
your
determination
you
are
henceforth
an
alien
among
your
people
you
may
retain
your
civil
rights
but
they
will
be
useless
to
you
for
you
will
never
be
chosen
by
your
if
you
solicit
their
suffrages
and
they
will
affect
to
scorn
you
if
you
solicit
their
esteem
you
will
remain
among
men
but
you
will
be
deprived
of
the
rights
of
mankind
your
will
shun
you
like
an
impure
being
and
those
who
are
most
persuaded
of
your
innocence
will
abandon
you
too
lest
they
should
be
shunned
in
their
turn
go
in
peace
i
have
given
you
your
life
but
it
is
an
existence
incomparably
worse
than
death
absolute
monarchies
have
thrown
an
odium
upon
despotism
let
us
beware
lest
democratic
republics
should
restore
oppression
and
should
render
it
less
odious
and
less
degrading
in
the
eyes
of
the
many
by
making
it
still
more
onerous
to
the
few
works
have
been
published
in
the
proudest
nations
of
the
old
world
expressly
intended
to
censure
the
vices
and
deride
the
follies
of
the
time
labruyère
inhabited
the
palace
of
louis
xiv
when
he
composed
his
chapter
upon
the
great
and
molière
criticised
the
courtiers
in
the
very
pieces
which
were
acted
before
the
court
but
the
ruling
power
in
the
united
states
is
not
to
be
made
game
of
the
smallest
reproach
irritates
its
sensibility
and
the
slightest
joke
which
has
any
foundation
in
truth
renders
it
indignant
from
the
style
of
its
language
to
the
more
solid
virtues
of
its
character
everything
must
be
made
the
subject
of
encomium
no
writer
whatever
be
his
eminence
can
escape
from
this
tribute
of
adulation
to
his
the
majority
lives
in
the
perpetual
exercise
of
and
there
are
certain
truths
which
the
americans
can
only
learn
from
strangers
or
from
experience
if
great
writers
have
not
at
present
existed
in
america
the
reason
is
very
simply
given
in
these
facts
there
can
be
no
literary
genius
without
freedom
of
opinion
and
freedom
of
opinion
does
not
exist
in
america
the
inquisition
has
never
been
able
to
prevent
a
vast
number
of
books
from
circulating
in
spain
the
empire
of
the
majority
succeeds
much
better
in
the
united
states
since
it
actually
removes
the
wish
of
publishing
them
unbelievers
are
to
be
met
with
in
america
but
to
say
the
truth
there
is
no
public
organ
of
infidelity
attempts
have
been
made
by
some
governments
to
protect
the
morality
of
nations
by
prohibiting
licentious
books
in
the
united
states
no
one
is
punished
for
this
sort
of
works
but
no
one
is
induced
to
write
them
not
because
all
the
citizens
are
immaculate
in
their
manners
but
because
the
majority
of
the
community
is
decent
and
orderly
in
these
cases
the
advantages
derived
from
the
exercise
of
this
power
are
unquestionable
and
i
am
simply
discussing
the
nature
of
the
power
itself
this
irresistible
authority
is
a
constant
fact
and
its
beneficent
exercise
is
an
accidental
occurrence
effects
of
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
upon
the
national
character
in
the
americans
effects
of
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
more
sensibly
felt
hitherto
in
the
manners
than
in
the
conduct
of
they
check
the
development
of
leading
democratic
republics
organized
like
the
united
states
bring
the
practice
of
courting
favor
within
the
reach
of
the
proofs
of
this
spirit
in
the
united
why
there
is
more
patriotism
in
the
people
than
in
those
who
govern
in
its
name
the
tendencies
which
i
have
just
alluded
to
are
as
yet
very
slightly
perceptible
in
political
society
but
they
already
begin
to
exercise
an
unfavorable
influence
upon
the
national
character
of
the
americans
i
am
inclined
to
attribute
the
paucity
of
distinguished
political
characters
to
the
activity
of
the
despotism
of
the
majority
in
the
united
states
when
the
american
revolution
broke
out
they
arose
in
great
numbers
for
public
opinion
then
served
not
to
tyrannize
over
but
to
direct
the
exertions
of
individuals
those
celebrated
men
took
a
full
part
in
the
general
agitation
of
mind
common
at
that
period
and
they
attained
a
high
degree
of
personal
fame
which
was
reflected
back
upon
the
nation
but
which
was
by
no
means
borrowed
from
it
in
absolute
governments
the
great
nobles
who
are
nearest
to
the
throne
flatter
the
passions
of
the
sovereign
and
voluntarily
truckle
to
his
caprices
but
the
mass
of
the
nation
does
not
degrade
itself
by
servitude
it
often
submits
from
weakness
from
habit
or
from
ignorance
and
sometimes
from
loyalty
some
nations
have
been
known
to
sacrifice
their
own
desires
to
those
of
the
sovereign
with
pleasure
and
with
pride
thus
exhibiting
a
sort
of
independence
in
the
very
act
of
submission
these
peoples
are
miserable
but
they
are
not
degraded
there
is
a
great
difference
between
doing
what
one
does
not
approve
and
feigning
to
approve
what
one
does
the
one
is
the
necessary
case
of
a
weak
person
the
other
befits
the
temper
of
a
lacquey
in
free
countries
where
every
one
is
more
or
less
called
upon
to
give
his
opinions
in
the
affairs
of
state
in
democratic
republics
where
public
life
is
incessantly
commingled
with
domestic
affairs
where
the
sovereign
authority
is
accessible
on
every
side
and
where
its
attention
can
almost
always
be
attracted
by
vociferation
more
persons
are
to
be
met
with
who
speculate
upon
its
foibles
and
live
at
the
cost
of
its
passions
than
in
absolute
monarchies
not
because
men
are
naturally
worse
in
these
states
than
elsewhere
but
the
temptation
is
stronger
and
of
easier
access
at
the
same
time
the
result
is
a
far
more
extensive
debasement
of
the
characters
of
citizens
democratic
republics
extend
the
practice
of
currying
favor
with
the
many
and
they
introduce
it
into
a
great
number
of
classes
at
once
this
is
one
of
the
most
serious
reproaches
that
can
be
addressed
to
them
in
democratic
states
organized
on
the
principles
of
the
american
republics
this
is
more
especially
the
case
where
the
authority
of
the
majority
is
so
absolute
and
so
irresistible
that
a
man
must
give
up
his
rights
as
a
citizen
and
almost
abjure
his
quality
as
a
human
being
if
he
intends
to
stray
from
the
track
which
it
lays
down
in
that
immense
crowd
which
throngs
the
avenues
to
power
in
the
united
states
i
found
very
few
men
who
displayed
any
of
that
manly
candor
and
that
masculine
independence
of
opinion
which
frequently
distinguished
the
americans
in
former
times
and
which
constitute
the
leading
feature
in
distinguished
characters
wheresoever
they
may
be
found
it
seems
at
first
sight
as
if
all
the
minds
of
the
americans
were
formed
upon
one
model
so
accurately
do
they
correspond
in
their
manner
of
judging
a
stranger
does
indeed
sometimes
meet
with
americans
who
dissent
from
these
rigorous
formularies
with
men
who
deplore
the
defects
of
the
laws
the
mutability
and
the
ignorance
of
democracy
who
even
go
so
far
as
to
observe
the
evil
tendencies
which
impair
the
national
character
and
to
point
out
such
remedies
as
it
might
be
possible
to
apply
but
no
one
is
there
to
hear
these
things
besides
yourself
and
you
to
whom
these
secret
reflections
are
confided
are
a
stranger
and
a
bird
of
passage
they
are
very
ready
to
communicate
truths
which
are
useless
to
you
but
they
continue
to
hold
a
different
language
in
public
if
ever
these
lines
are
read
in
america
i
am
well
assured
of
two
things
in
the
first
place
that
all
who
peruse
them
will
raise
their
voices
to
condemn
me
and
in
the
second
place
that
very
many
of
them
will
acquit
me
at
the
bottom
of
their
conscience
the
author
views
upon
what
he
terms
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
the
despotism
of
public
opinion
in
the
united
states
have
already
excited
some
remarks
in
this
country
and
will
probably
give
occasion
to
more
as
stated
in
the
preface
to
this
edition
the
editor
does
not
conceive
himself
called
upon
to
discuss
the
speculative
opinions
of
the
author
and
supposes
he
will
best
discharge
his
duty
by
confining
his
observations
to
what
he
deems
errors
of
fact
or
law
but
in
reference
to
this
particular
subject
it
seems
due
to
the
author
to
remark
that
he
visited
the
united
states
at
a
particular
time
when
a
successful
political
chieftain
had
succeeded
in
establishing
his
party
in
power
as
it
seemed
firmly
and
permanently
when
the
preponderance
of
that
party
was
immense
and
when
there
seemed
little
prospect
of
any
change
he
may
have
met
with
men
who
sank
under
the
astonishing
popularity
of
general
jackson
who
despaired
of
the
republic
and
who
therefore
shrank
from
the
expression
of
their
opinions
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
the
author
is
obnoxious
to
the
charge
which
has
been
made
of
the
want
of
perspicuity
and
distinctness
in
this
part
of
his
work
he
does
not
mean
that
the
press
was
silent
for
he
has
himself
not
only
noticed
but
furnished
proof
of
the
great
freedom
not
to
say
licentiousness
with
which
it
assailed
the
character
of
the
president
and
the
measures
of
his
administration
he
does
not
mean
to
represent
the
opponents
of
the
dominant
party
as
having
thrown
down
their
weapons
of
warfare
for
his
book
shows
throughout
his
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
an
active
and
able
party
constantly
opposing
and
harassing
the
administration
but
after
a
careful
perusal
of
the
chapters
on
this
subject
the
editor
is
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
de
tocqueville
intends
to
speak
of
the
of
the
in
excluding
from
public
employment
all
those
who
do
not
adopt
the
of
the
majority
the
language
at
pp
which
he
puts
in
the
mouth
of
a
majority
and
his
observations
immediately
preceding
this
note
seem
to
furnish
the
key
to
his
meaning
although
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
are
other
passages
to
which
a
wider
construction
may
be
given
perhaps
they
may
be
reconciled
by
the
idea
that
the
author
considers
the
acts
and
opinions
of
the
dominant
party
as
the
just
and
true
expression
of
public
opinion
and
hence
when
he
speaks
of
the
intolerance
of
public
opinion
he
means
the
exclusiveness
of
the
party
which
for
the
time
being
may
be
predominant
he
had
seen
men
of
acknowledged
competency
removed
from
office
or
excluded
from
it
wholly
on
the
ground
of
their
entertaining
opinions
hostile
to
those
of
the
dominant
party
or
majority
and
he
had
seen
this
system
extended
to
the
very
lowest
officers
of
the
government
and
applied
by
the
electors
in
their
choice
of
all
officers
of
all
descriptions
and
this
he
deemed
persecution
tyranny
despotism
but
he
surely
is
mistaken
in
representing
the
effect
of
this
system
of
terror
as
stifling
all
complaint
silencing
all
opposition
and
inducing
enemies
and
friends
to
yoke
themselves
alike
to
the
triumphant
car
of
the
majority
he
mistook
a
temporary
state
of
parties
for
a
permanent
and
ordinary
result
and
he
was
carried
away
by
the
immense
majority
that
then
supported
the
administration
to
the
belief
of
a
universal
acquiescence
without
intending
here
to
speak
of
the
merits
or
demerits
of
those
who
represented
that
majority
it
is
proper
to
remark
that
the
great
change
which
has
taken
place
since
the
period
when
the
author
wrote
in
the
political
condition
of
the
very
persons
who
he
supposed
then
wielded
the
terrors
of
disfranchisement
against
their
opponents
in
itself
furnishes
a
full
and
complete
demonstration
of
the
error
of
his
opinions
respecting
the
true
independence
of
mind
and
freedom
of
discussion
in
america
for
without
such
discussion
to
enlighten
the
minds
of
the
people
and
without
a
stern
independence
of
the
rewards
and
threats
of
those
in
power
the
change
alluded
to
could
not
have
occurred
there
is
reason
to
complain
not
only
of
the
ambiguity
but
of
the
style
of
exaggeration
which
pervades
all
the
remarks
of
the
author
on
this
subject
so
different
from
the
well
considered
and
nicely
adjusted
language
employed
by
him
on
all
other
topics
thus
he
implies
that
there
is
no
means
of
redress
afforded
even
by
the
judiciary
for
a
wrong
committed
by
the
majority
his
error
is
in
supposing
the
jury
to
constitute
the
judicial
power
overlooking
what
he
has
himself
elsewhere
so
well
described
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
and
its
means
of
controlling
the
action
of
a
majority
in
a
state
or
in
the
federal
government
and
in
omitting
the
proper
consideration
of
the
frequent
changes
of
popular
sentiment
by
which
the
majority
of
yesterday
becomes
the
minority
of
and
its
acts
of
injustice
are
reversed
certain
it
is
that
the
instances
which
he
cites
at
this
page
do
not
establish
his
position
respecting
the
disposition
of
the
majority
the
riot
at
baltimore
was
like
other
riots
in
england
and
in
france
the
result
of
popular
phrensy
excited
to
madness
by
conduct
of
the
most
provoking
character
the
majority
in
the
state
of
maryland
and
throughout
the
united
states
highly
disapproved
the
acts
of
violence
committed
on
the
occasion
the
acquittal
by
a
jury
of
those
arraigned
for
the
murder
of
general
lingan
proves
only
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
identify
the
accused
or
that
the
jury
was
governed
by
passion
it
is
not
perceived
how
the
majority
of
the
people
are
answerable
for
the
verdicts
rendered
the
guilty
have
often
been
erroneously
acquitted
in
all
countries
and
in
france
particularly
recent
instances
are
not
wanting
of
acquittals
especially
in
prosecutions
for
political
offences
against
clear
and
indisputable
testimony
and
it
was
entirely
fortuitous
that
the
jury
was
composed
of
men
whose
sympathies
were
with
the
rioters
and
murderers
if
the
fact
was
so
it
not
unfrequently
happens
that
a
jury
taken
from
lists
furnished
years
perhaps
and
always
a
long
time
before
the
trial
are
decidedly
hostile
to
the
temporary
prevailing
sentiments
of
their
city
county
or
state
as
in
the
other
instance
if
the
inhabitant
of
pennsylvania
intended
to
intimate
to
our
author
that
a
colored
voter
would
be
in
personal
jeopardy
for
venturing
to
appear
at
the
polls
to
exercise
his
right
it
must
be
said
in
truth
that
the
incident
was
local
and
peculiar
and
contrary
to
what
is
annually
seen
throughout
the
states
where
colored
persons
are
permitted
to
vote
who
exercise
that
privilege
with
as
full
immunity
from
injury
or
oppression
as
any
white
citizen
and
after
all
it
is
believed
that
the
state
of
feeling
intimated
by
the
informant
of
our
author
is
but
an
indication
of
dislike
to
a
degraded
by
servitude
and
ignorance
and
it
is
not
perceived
how
it
proves
the
despotism
of
a
majority
over
the
freedom
and
independence
of
opinion
if
it
be
true
it
proves
a
detestable
tyranny
over
over
the
exercise
of
an
acknowledged
right
the
apprehensions
of
a
mob
committing
violence
deterred
the
colored
voters
from
approaching
the
polls
are
instances
unknown
in
england
or
even
in
france
of
peaceable
subjects
being
prevented
by
mobs
or
the
fear
of
them
from
the
exercise
of
a
right
from
the
discharge
of
a
duty
and
are
they
evidences
of
the
despotism
of
a
majority
in
those
countries
i
have
heard
of
patriotism
in
the
united
states
and
it
is
a
virtue
which
may
be
found
among
the
people
but
never
among
the
leaders
of
the
people
this
may
be
explained
by
analogy
despotism
debases
the
oppressed
much
more
than
the
oppressor
in
absolute
monarchies
the
king
has
often
great
virtues
but
the
courtiers
are
invariably
servile
it
is
true
that
the
american
courtiers
do
not
say
sire
or
your
majesty
a
distinction
without
a
difference
they
are
for
ever
talking
of
the
natural
intelligence
of
the
populace
they
serve
they
do
not
debate
the
question
as
to
which
of
the
virtues
of
their
master
are
worthy
of
admiration
for
they
assure
him
that
he
possesses
all
the
virtues
under
heaven
without
having
acquired
them
or
without
caring
to
acquire
them
they
do
not
give
him
their
daughters
and
their
wives
to
be
raised
at
his
pleasure
to
the
rank
of
his
concubines
but
by
sacrificing
their
opinions
they
prostitute
themselves
moralists
and
philosophers
in
america
are
not
obliged
to
conceal
their
opinions
under
the
veil
of
allegory
but
before
they
venture
upon
a
harsh
truth
they
say
we
are
aware
that
the
people
which
we
are
addressing
is
too
superior
to
all
the
weaknesses
of
human
nature
to
lose
the
command
of
its
temper
for
an
instant
and
we
should
not
hold
this
language
if
we
were
not
speaking
to
men
whom
their
virtues
and
their
intelligence
render
more
worthy
of
freedom
than
all
the
rest
of
the
world
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
sycophants
of
louis
xiv
to
flatter
more
dexterously
for
my
part
i
am
persuaded
that
in
all
governments
whatever
their
nature
may
be
servility
will
cower
to
force
and
adulation
will
cling
to
power
the
only
means
of
preventing
men
from
degrading
themselves
is
to
invest
no
one
with
that
unlimited
authority
which
is
the
surest
method
of
debasing
them
the
greatest
dangers
of
the
american
republics
proceed
from
the
unlimited
power
of
the
majority
democratic
republics
liable
to
perish
from
a
misuse
of
their
power
and
not
by
the
governments
of
the
american
republics
are
more
centralized
and
more
energetic
than
those
of
the
monarchies
of
dangers
resulting
from
opinions
of
hamilton
and
jefferson
upon
this
point
governments
usually
fall
a
sacrifice
to
impotence
or
to
tyranny
in
the
former
case
their
power
escapes
from
them
it
is
wrested
from
their
grasp
in
the
latter
many
observers
who
have
noticed
the
anarchy
of
domestic
states
have
imagined
that
the
government
of
those
states
was
naturally
weak
and
impotent
the
truth
is
that
when
once
hostilities
are
begun
between
parties
the
government
loses
its
control
over
society
but
i
do
not
think
that
a
democratic
power
is
naturally
without
resources
say
rather
that
it
is
almost
always
by
the
abuse
of
its
force
and
the
misemployment
of
its
resources
that
a
democratic
government
fails
anarchy
is
almost
always
produced
by
its
tyranny
or
its
mistakes
but
not
by
its
want
of
strength
it
is
important
not
to
confound
stability
with
force
or
the
greatness
of
a
thing
with
its
duration
in
democratic
republics
the
power
which
directs
society
is
not
stable
for
it
often
changes
hands
and
assumes
a
new
direction
but
whichever
way
it
turns
its
force
is
almost
irresistible
the
governments
of
the
american
republics
appear
to
me
to
be
as
much
centralized
as
those
of
the
absolute
monarchies
of
europe
and
more
energetic
than
they
are
i
do
not
therefore
imagine
that
they
will
perish
from
weakness
if
ever
the
free
institutions
of
america
are
destroyed
that
event
may
be
attributed
to
the
unlimited
authority
of
the
majority
which
may
at
some
future
time
urge
the
minorities
to
desperation
and
oblige
them
to
have
recourse
to
physical
force
anarchy
will
then
be
the
result
but
it
will
have
been
brought
about
by
despotism
hamilton
expresses
the
same
opinion
in
the
federalist
no
it
is
of
great
importance
in
a
republic
not
only
to
guard
the
society
against
the
oppression
of
its
rulers
but
to
guard
one
part
of
the
society
against
the
injustice
of
the
other
part
justice
is
the
end
of
government
it
is
the
end
of
civil
society
it
ever
has
been
and
ever
will
be
pursued
until
it
be
obtained
or
until
liberty
be
lost
in
the
pursuit
in
a
society
under
the
forms
of
which
the
stronger
faction
can
readily
unite
and
oppress
the
weaker
anarchy
may
as
truly
be
said
to
reign
as
in
a
state
of
nature
where
the
weaker
individual
is
not
secured
against
the
violence
of
the
stronger
and
as
in
the
latter
state
even
the
stronger
individuals
are
prompted
by
the
uncertainty
of
their
condition
to
submit
to
a
government
which
may
protect
the
weak
as
well
as
themselves
so
in
the
former
state
will
the
more
powerful
factions
be
gradually
induced
by
a
like
motive
to
wish
for
a
government
which
will
protect
all
parties
the
weaker
as
well
as
the
more
powerful
it
can
be
little
doubted
that
if
the
state
of
rhode
island
was
separated
from
the
confederacy
and
left
to
itself
the
insecurity
of
rights
under
the
popular
form
of
government
within
such
narrow
limits
would
be
displayed
by
such
reiterated
oppression
of
the
factious
majorities
that
some
power
altogether
independent
of
the
people
would
soon
be
called
for
by
the
voice
of
the
very
factions
whose
misrule
had
proved
the
necessity
of
it
jefferson
has
also
expressed
himself
in
a
letter
to
madison
the
executive
power
in
our
government
is
not
the
only
perhaps
not
even
the
principal
object
of
my
solicitude
the
tyranny
of
the
legislature
is
really
the
danger
most
to
be
feared
and
will
continue
to
be
so
for
many
years
to
come
the
tyranny
of
the
executive
power
will
come
in
its
turn
but
at
a
more
distant
period
i
am
glad
to
cite
the
opinion
of
jefferson
upon
this
subject
rather
than
that
of
another
because
i
consider
him
to
be
the
most
powerful
advocate
democracy
has
ever
sent
forth
notes
we
observed
in
examining
the
federal
constitution
that
the
efforts
of
the
legislators
of
the
union
had
been
diametrically
opposed
to
the
present
tendency
the
consequence
has
been
that
the
federal
government
is
more
independent
in
its
sphere
than
that
of
the
states
but
the
federal
government
scarcely
ever
interferes
in
any
but
external
affairs
and
the
governments
of
the
states
are
in
reality
the
authorities
which
direct
society
in
america
the
legislative
acts
promulgated
by
the
state
of
massachusetts
alone
from
the
year
to
the
present
time
already
fill
three
stout
volumes
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
collection
to
which
i
allude
was
published
in
when
many
old
laws
which
had
fallen
into
disuse
were
omitted
the
state
of
massachusetts
which
is
not
more
populous
than
a
department
of
france
may
be
considered
as
the
most
stable
the
most
consistent
and
the
most
sagacious
in
its
undertakings
of
the
whole
union
no
one
will
assert
that
a
people
can
not
forcibly
wrong
another
people
but
parties
may
be
looked
upon
as
lesser
nations
within
a
greater
one
and
they
are
aliens
to
each
other
if
therefore
it
be
admitted
that
a
nation
can
act
tyrannically
toward
another
nation
it
can
not
be
denied
that
a
party
may
do
the
same
toward
another
party
a
striking
instance
of
the
excesses
which
may
be
occasioned
by
the
despotism
of
the
majority
occurred
at
baltimore
in
the
year
at
that
time
the
war
was
very
popular
in
baltimore
a
journal
which
had
taken
the
other
side
of
the
question
excited
the
indignation
of
the
inhabitants
by
its
opposition
the
populace
assembled
broke
the
and
attacked
the
houses
of
the
newspaper
editors
the
militia
was
called
out
but
no
one
obeyed
the
call
and
the
only
means
of
saving
the
poor
wretches
who
were
threatened
by
the
phrensy
of
the
mob
was
to
throw
them
into
prison
as
common
malefactors
but
even
this
precaution
was
ineffectual
the
mob
collected
again
during
the
night
the
magistrates
again
made
a
vain
attempt
to
call
out
the
militia
the
prison
was
forced
one
of
the
newspaper
editors
was
killed
upon
the
spot
and
the
others
were
left
for
dead
the
guilty
parties
were
acquitted
by
the
jury
when
they
were
brought
to
trial
i
said
one
day
to
an
inhabitant
of
pennsylvania
be
so
good
as
to
explain
to
me
how
it
happens
that
in
a
state
founded
by
quakers
and
celebrated
for
its
toleration
freed
blacks
are
not
allowed
to
exercise
civil
rights
they
pay
the
taxes
is
it
not
fair
that
they
should
have
a
vote
you
insult
us
replied
my
informant
if
you
imagine
that
our
legislators
could
have
committed
so
gross
an
act
of
injustice
and
intolerance
what
then
the
blacks
possess
the
right
of
voting
in
this
country
without
the
smallest
doubt
how
comes
it
then
that
at
the
this
morning
i
did
not
perceive
a
single
negro
in
the
whole
meeting
this
is
not
the
fault
of
the
law
the
negroes
have
the
undisputed
right
of
voting
but
they
voluntarily
abstain
from
making
their
appearance
a
very
pretty
piece
of
modesty
on
their
parts
rejoined
i
why
the
truth
is
that
they
are
not
disinclined
to
vote
but
they
are
afraid
of
being
maltreated
in
this
country
the
law
is
sometimes
unable
to
maintain
its
authority
without
the
support
of
the
majority
but
in
this
case
the
majority
entertains
very
strong
prejudices
against
the
blacks
and
the
magistrates
are
unable
to
protect
them
in
the
exercise
of
their
legal
privileges
what
then
the
majority
claims
the
right
not
only
of
making
the
laws
but
of
breaking
the
laws
it
has
made
this
power
may
be
centred
in
an
assembly
in
which
case
it
will
be
strong
without
being
stable
or
it
may
be
centred
in
an
individual
in
which
case
it
will
be
less
strong
but
more
stable
i
presume
that
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
here
as
well
as
throughout
the
remainder
of
this
chapter
that
i
am
speaking
not
of
the
federal
government
but
of
the
several
governments
of
each
state
which
the

controls
at
its
pleasure

causes
which
mitigate
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
in
the
united

absence
of
central
administration
the
national
majority
does
not
pretend
to
conduct
all
is
obliged
to
employ
the
town
and
county
magistrates
to
execute
its
supreme
decisions
i
have
already
pointed
out
the
distinction
which
is
to
be
made
between
a
centralized
government
and
a
centralized
administration
the
former
exists
in
america
but
the
latter
is
nearly
unknown
there
if
the
directing
power
of
the
american
communities
had
both
these
instruments
of
government
at
its
disposal
and
united
the
habit
of
executing
its
own
commands
to
the
right
of
commanding
if
after
having
established
the
general
principles
of
government
it
descended
to
the
details
of
public
business
and
if
having
regulated
the
great
interests
of
the
country
it
would
penetrate
into
the
privacy
of
individual
interest
freedom
would
soon
be
banished
from
the
new
world
but
in
the
united
states
the
majority
which
so
frequently
displays
the
tastes
and
the
propensities
of
a
despot
is
still
destitute
of
the
more
perfect
instruments
of
tyranny
in
the
american
republics
the
activity
of
the
central
government
has
never
as
yet
been
extended
beyond
a
limited
number
of
objects
sufficiently
prominent
to
call
forth
its
attention
the
secondary
affairs
of
society
have
never
been
regulated
by
its
authority
and
nothing
has
hitherto
betrayed
its
desire
of
interfering
in
them
the
majority
is
become
more
and
more
absolute
but
it
has
not
increased
the
prerogatives
of
the
central
government
those
great
prerogatives
have
been
confined
to
a
certain
sphere
and
although
the
despotism
of
the
majority
may
be
galling
upon
one
point
it
can
not
be
said
to
extend
to
all
however
the
predominant
party
of
the
nation
may
be
carried
away
by
its
passions
however
ardent
it
may
be
in
the
pursuit
of
its
projects
it
can
not
oblige
all
the
citizens
to
comply
with
its
desire
in
the
same
manner
and
at
the
same
time
throughout
the
country
when
the
central
government
which
represents
that
majority
has
issued
a
decree
it
must
intrust
the
execution
of
its
will
to
agents
over
whom
it
frequently
has
no
control
and
whom
it
can
not
perpetually
direct
the
townships
municipal
bodies
and
counties
may
therefore
be
looked
upon
as
concealed
breakwaters
which
check
or
part
the
tide
of
popular
excitement
if
an
oppressive
law
were
passed
the
liberties
of
the
people
would
still
be
protected
by
the
means
by
which
that
law
would
be
put
in
execution
the
majority
can
not
descend
to
the
details
and
as
i
will
venture
to
style
them
the
puerilities
of
administrative
tyranny
nor
does
the
people
entertain
that
full
consciousness
of
its
authority
which
would
prompt
it
to
interfere
in
these
matters
it
knows
the
extent
of
its
natural
powers
but
it
is
unacquainted
with
the
increased
resources
which
the
art
of
government
might
furnish
this
point
deserves
attention
for
if
a
democratic
republic
similar
to
that
of
the
united
states
were
ever
founded
in
a
country
where
the
power
of
a
single
individual
had
previously
subsisted
and
the
effects
of
a
centralized
administration
had
sunk
deep
into
the
habits
and
the
laws
of
the
people
i
do
not
hesitate
to
assert
that
in
that
country
a
more
insufferable
despotism
would
prevail
than
any
which
now
exists
in
the
absolute
monarchies
of
europe
or
indeed
than
any
which
could
be
found
on
this
side
the
confines
of
asia
the
profession
of
the
law
in
the
united
states
serves
to
counterpoise
the
democracy
utility
of
discriminating
the
natural
propensities
of
the
members
of
the
legal
these
men
called
upon
to
act
a
prominent
part
in
future
in
what
manner
the
peculiar
pursuits
of
lawyers
give
an
aristocratic
turn
to
their
accidental
causes
which
may
check
this
ease
with
which
the
aristocracy
coalesces
with
legal
use
of
lawyers
to
a
the
profession
of
the
law
constitutes
the
only
aristocratic
element
with
which
the
natural
elements
of
democracy
will
peculiar
causes
which
tend
to
give
an
aristocratic
turn
of
mind
to
the
english
and
american
the
aristocracy
of
america
is
on
the
bench
and
at
the
influence
of
lawyers
upon
american
their
peculiar
magisterial
habits
affect
the
legislature
the
administration
and
even
the
people
in
visiting
the
americans
and
in
studying
their
laws
we
perceive
that
the
authority
they
have
intrusted
to
members
of
the
legal
profession
and
the
influence
which
these
individuals
exercise
in
the
government
is
the
most
powerful
existing
security
against
the
excesses
of
democracy
this
effect
seems
to
me
to
result
from
a
general
cause
which
it
is
useful
to
investigate
since
it
may
produce
analogous
consequences
elsewhere
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
have
taken
an
important
part
in
all
the
vicissitudes
of
political
society
in
europe
during
the
last
five
hundred
years
at
one
time
they
have
been
the
instruments
of
those
who
are
invested
with
political
authority
and
at
another
they
have
succeeded
in
converting
political
authorities
into
their
instrument
in
the
middle
ages
they
afforded
a
powerful
support
to
the
crown
and
since
that
period
they
have
exerted
themselves
to
the
utmost
to
limit
the
royal
prerogative
in
england
they
have
contracted
a
close
alliance
with
the
aristocracy
in
france
they
have
proved
to
be
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
that
class
it
is
my
object
to
inquire
whether
under
all
these
circumstances
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
have
been
swayed
by
sudden
and
momentary
impulses
or
whether
they
have
been
impelled
by
principles
which
are
inherent
in
their
pursuits
and
which
will
always
recur
in
history
i
am
incited
to
this
investigation
by
reflecting
that
this
particular
class
of
men
will
most
likely
play
a
prominent
part
in
that
order
of
things
to
which
the
events
of
our
time
are
giving
birth
men
who
have
more
especially
devoted
themselves
to
legal
pursuits
derive
from
those
occupations
certain
habits
of
order
a
taste
for
formalities
and
a
kind
of
instinctive
regard
for
the
regular
connexion
of
ideas
which
naturally
render
them
very
hostile
to
the
revolutionary
spirit
and
the
unreflecting
passions
of
the
multitude
the
special
information
which
lawyers
derive
from
their
studies
ensures
them
a
separate
station
in
society
and
they
constitute
a
sort
of
privileged
body
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
this
notion
of
their
superiority
perpetually
recurs
to
them
in
the
practice
of
their
profession
they
are
the
masters
of
a
science
which
is
necessary
but
which
is
not
very
generally
known
they
serve
as
arbiters
between
the
citizens
and
the
habit
of
directing
the
blind
passions
of
parties
in
litigation
to
their
purpose
inspires
them
with
a
certain
contempt
for
the
judgment
of
the
multitude
to
this
it
may
be
added
that
they
naturally
constitute
not
by
any
previous
understanding
or
by
any
agreement
which
directs
them
to
a
common
end
but
the
analogy
of
their
studies
and
the
uniformity
of
their
proceedings
connect
their
minds
together
as
much
as
a
common
interest
would
combine
their
endeavors
a
portion
of
the
tastes
and
of
the
habits
of
the
aristocracy
may
consequently
be
discovered
in
the
characters
of
men
in
the
profession
of
the
law
they
participate
in
the
same
instinctive
love
of
order
and
of
formalities
and
they
entertain
the
same
repugnance
to
the
actions
of
the
multitude
and
the
same
secret
contempt
of
the
government
of
the
people
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
natural
propensities
of
lawyers
are
sufficiently
strong
to
sway
them
irresistibly
for
they
like
most
other
men
are
governed
by
their
private
interests
and
the
advantages
of
the
moment
in
a
state
of
society
in
which
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
are
prevented
from
holding
that
rank
in
the
political
world
which
they
enjoy
in
private
life
we
may
rest
assured
that
they
will
be
the
foremost
agents
of
revolution
but
it
must
then
be
inquired
whether
the
cause
which
induces
them
to
innovate
and
to
destroy
is
accidental
or
whether
it
belongs
to
some
lasting
purpose
which
they
entertain
it
is
true
that
lawyers
mainly
contributed
to
the
overthrow
of
the
french
monarchy
in
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
they
acted
thus
because
they
had
studied
the
laws
or
because
they
were
prohibited
from
in
the
work
of
legislation
five
hundred
years
ago
the
english
nobles
headed
the
people
and
spoke
in
its
name
at
the
present
time
the
aristocracy
supports
the
throne
and
defends
the
royal
prerogative
but
aristocracy
has
notwithstanding
this
its
peculiar
instincts
and
propensities
we
must
be
careful
not
to
confound
isolated
members
of
a
body
with
the
body
itself
in
all
free
governments
of
whatsoever
form
they
may
be
members
of
the
legal
profession
may
be
found
at
the
head
of
all
parties
the
same
remark
is
also
applicable
to
the
aristocracy
for
almost
all
the
democratic
convulsions
which
have
agitated
the
world
have
been
directed
by
nobles
a
privileged
body
can
never
satisfy
the
ambition
of
all
its
members
it
has
always
more
talents
and
more
passions
than
it
can
find
places
to
content
and
to
employ
so
that
a
considerable
number
of
individuals
are
usually
to
be
met
with
who
are
inclined
to
attack
those
very
privileges
which
they
find
it
impossible
to
turn
to
their
own
account
i
do
not
then
assert
that
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
are
at
times
the
friends
of
order
and
the
opponents
of
innovation
but
merely
that
most
of
them
usually
are
so
in
a
community
in
which
lawyers
are
allowed
to
occupy
without
opposition
that
high
station
which
naturally
belongs
to
them
their
general
spirit
will
be
eminently
conservative
and
when
an
aristocracy
excludes
the
leaders
of
that
profession
from
its
ranks
it
excites
enemies
which
are
the
more
formidable
to
its
security
as
they
are
independent
of
the
nobility
by
their
industrious
pursuits
and
they
feel
themselves
to
be
its
equal
in
point
of
intelligence
although
they
enjoy
less
opulence
and
less
power
but
whenever
an
aristocracy
consents
to
impart
some
of
its
privileges
to
these
same
individuals
the
two
classes
coalesce
very
readily
and
assume
as
it
were
the
consistency
of
a
single
order
of
family
interests
i
am
in
like
manner
inclined
to
believe
that
a
monarch
will
always
be
able
to
convert
legal
practitioners
into
the
most
serviceable
instruments
of
his
authority
there
is
a
far
greater
affinity
between
this
class
of
individuals
and
the
executive
power
than
there
is
between
them
and
the
people
just
as
there
is
a
greater
natural
affinity
between
the
nobles
and
monarch
than
between
the
nobles
and
the
people
although
the
higher
orders
of
society
have
occasionally
resisted
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
in
concert
with
the
lower
classes
lawyers
are
attached
to
public
order
beyond
every
other
consideration
and
the
best
security
of
public
order
is
authority
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
if
they
prize
the
free
institutions
of
their
country
much
they
nevertheless
value
the
legality
of
those
institutions
far
more
they
are
less
afraid
of
tyranny
than
of
arbitrary
power
and
provided
that
the
legislature
takes
upon
itself
to
deprive
men
of
their
independence
they
are
not
dissatisfied
i
am
therefore
convinced
that
the
prince
who
in
presence
of
an
encroaching
democracy
should
endeavor
to
impair
the
judicial
authority
in
his
dominions
and
to
diminish
the
political
influence
of
lawyers
would
commit
a
great
mistake
he
would
let
slip
the
substance
of
authority
to
grasp
at
the
shadow
he
would
act
more
wisely
in
introducing
men
connected
with
the
law
into
the
government
and
if
he
intrusted
them
with
the
conduct
of
a
despotic
power
bearing
some
marks
of
violence
that
power
would
most
likely
assume
the
external
features
of
justice
and
of
legality
in
their
hands
the
government
of
democracy
is
favorable
to
the
political
power
of
lawyers
for
when
the
wealthy
the
noble
and
the
prince
are
excluded
from
the
government
they
are
sure
to
occupy
the
highest
stations
in
their
own
right
as
it
were
since
they
are
the
only
men
of
information
and
sagacity
beyond
the
sphere
of
the
people
who
can
be
the
object
of
the
popular
choice
if
then
they
are
led
by
their
tastes
to
combine
with
the
aristocracy
and
to
support
the
crown
they
are
naturally
brought
into
contact
with
the
people
by
their
interests
they
like
the
government
of
democracy
without
participating
in
its
propensities
and
without
imitating
its
weaknesses
whence
they
derive
a
twofold
authority
from
it
and
over
it
the
people
in
democratic
states
does
not
mistrust
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
because
it
is
well
known
that
they
are
interested
in
serving
the
popular
cause
and
it
listens
to
them
without
irritation
because
it
does
not
attribute
to
them
any
sinister
designs
the
object
of
lawyers
is
not
indeed
to
overthrow
the
institutions
of
democracy
but
they
constantly
endeavor
to
give
it
an
impulse
which
diverts
it
from
its
real
tendency
by
means
which
are
foreign
to
its
nature

belong
to
the
people
by
birth
and
interest
to
the
aristocracy
by
habit
and
by
taste
and
they
may
be
looked
upon
as
the
natural
bond
and
connecting
link
of
the
two
great
classes
of
society
the
profession
of
the
law
is
the
only
aristocratic
element
which
can
be
amalgamated
without
violence
with
the
natural
elements
of
democracy
and
which
can
be
advantageously
and
permanently
combined
with
them
i
am
not
unacquainted
with
the
defects
which
are
inherent
in
the
character
of
that
body
of
men
but
without
this
admixture
of
sobriety
with
the
democratic
principle
i
question
whether
democratic
institutions
could
long
be
maintained
and
i
can
not
believe
that
a
republic
could
subsist
at
the
present
time
if
the
influence
of
lawyers
in
public
business
did
not
increase
in
proportion
to
the
power
of
the
people
this
aristocratic
character
which
i
hold
to
be
common
to
the
legal
profession
is
much
more
distinctly
marked
in
the
united
states
and
in
england
than
in
any
other
country
this
proceeds
not
only
from
the
legal
studies
of
the
english
and
american
lawyers
but
from
the
nature
of
the
legislation
and
the
position
which
those
persons
occupy
in
the
two
countries
the
english
and
the
americans
have
retained
the
law
of
precedents
that
is
to
say
they
continue
to
found
their
legal
opinions
and
the
decisions
of
their
courts
upon
the
opinions
and
decisions
of
their
forefathers
in
the
mind
of
an
english
or
an
american
lawyer
a
taste
and
a
reverence
for
what
is
old
are
almost
always
united
to
a
love
of
regular
and
lawful
proceedings
this
predisposition
has
another
effect
upon
the
character
of
the
legal
profession
and
upon
the
general
course
of
society
the
english
and
american
lawyers
investigate
what
has
been
done
the
french
advocate
inquires
what
should
have
been
done
the
former
produces
precedents
the
latter
reasons
a
french
observer
is
surprised
to
hear
how
often
an
english
or
american
lawyer
quotes
the
opinions
of
others
and
how
little
he
alludes
to
his
own
while
the
reverse
occurs
in
france
there
the
most
trifling
litigation
is
never
conducted
without
the
introduction
of
an
entire
system
of
ideas
peculiar
to
the
counsel
employed
and
the
fundamental
principles
of
law
are
discussed
in
order
to
obtain
a
perch
of
land
by
the
decision
of
the
court
this
abnegation
of
his
own
opinion
and
this
implicit
deference
to
the
opinion
of
his
forefathers
which
are
common
to
the
english
and
american
lawyer
this
subjection
of
thought
which
he
is
obliged
to
profess
necessarily
give
him
more
timid
habits
and
more
sluggish
inclinations
in
england
and
america
than
in
france
the
french
codes
are
often
difficult
of
comprehension
but
they
can
be
read
by
every
one
nothing
on
the
other
hand
can
be
more
impenetrable
to
the
uninitiated
than
a
legislation
founded
upon
precedents
the
indispensable
want
of
legal
assistance
which
is
felt
in
england
and
in
the
united
states
and
the
high
opinion
which
is
generally
entertained
of
the
ability
of
the
legal
profession
tend
to
separate
it
more
and
more
from
the
people
and
to
place
it
in
a
distinct
class
the
french
lawyer
is
simply
a
man
extensively
acquainted
with
the
statutes
of
his
country
but
the
english
or
american
lawyer
resembles
the
hierophants
of
egypt
for
like
them
he
is
the
sole
interpreter
of
an
occult
science
the
remark
that
english
and
american
lawyers
found
their
opinions
and
their
decisions
upon
those
of
their
forefathers
is
calculated
to
excite
surprise
in
an
american
reader
who
supposes
that
law
as
a
prescribed
rule
of
action
can
only
be
ascertained
in
cases
where
the
statutes
are
silent
by
reference
to
the
decisions
of
courts
on
the
continent
and
particularly
in
france
as
the
writer
of
this
note
learned
from
the
conversation
of
de
tocqueville
the
judicial
tribunals
do
not
deem
themselves
bound
by
any
precedents
or
by
any
decisions
of
their
predecessors
or
of
the
appellate
tribunals
they
respect
such
decisions
as
the
opinions
of
distinguished
men
and
they
pay
no
higher
regard
to
their
own
previous
adjudications
of
any
case
it
is
not
easy
to
perceive
how
the
law
can
acquire
any
stability
under
such
a
system
or
how
any
individual
can
ascertain
his
rights
without
a
lawsuit
this
note
should
not
be
concluded
without
a
single
remark
upon
what
the
author
calls
an
implicit
deference
to
the
opinions
of
our
forefathers
and
abnegation
of
our
own
opinions
the
common
law
consists
of
principles
founded
on
the
common
sense
of
mankind
and
adapted
to
the
circumstances
of
man
in
civilized
society
when
these
principles
are
once
settled
by
competent
authority
or
rather
by
such
authority
they
are
supposed
to
express
the
common
sense
and
the
common
justice
of
the
community
and
it
requires
but
a
moderate
share
of
modesty
for
any
one
entertaining
a
different
view
of
them
to
consider
that
the
disinterested
and
intelligent
judges
who
have
declared
them
are
more
likely
to
be
right
than
he
is
perfection
even
in
the
law
he
does
not
consider
attainable
by
human
beings
and
the
greatest
approximation
to
it
is
all
he
expects
or
desires
besides
there
are
very
few
cases
of
positive
and
abstract
rule
where
it
is
of
any
consequence
which
of
any
two
or
more
modifications
of
it
should
be
adopted
the
great
point
is
that
there
should
be
by
which
conduct
may
be
regulated
thus
whether
in
mercantile
transactions
notice
of
a
default
by
a
principal
shall
be
given
to
an
endorser
or
a
guarantor
and
when
and
how
such
notice
shall
be
given
are
not
so
important
in
themselves
as
it
is
that
there
should
be
some
rule
to
which
merchants
may
adapt
themselves
and
their
transactions
statutes
can
not
or
at
least
do
not
prescribe
the
rules
in
a
large
majority
of
cases
if
then
they
are
not
drawn
from
the
decision
of
courts
they
will
not
exist
and
men
will
be
wholly
at
a
loss
for
a
guide
in
the
most
important
transactions
of
business
hence
the
deference
paid
to
legal
decisions
but
this
is
not
implicit
as
the
author
supposes
the
course
of
reasoning
by
which
the
courts
have
come
to
their
conclusions
is
often
assailed
by
the
advocate
and
shown
to
be
fallacious
and
the
instances
are
not
unfrequent
of
courts
disregarding
prior
decisions
and
overruling
them
when
not
fairly
deducible
from
sound
reason
again
the
principles
of
the
common
law
are
flexible
and
adapt
themselves
to
changes
in
society
and
a
maxim
in
our
system
that
when
the
reason
of
the
law
ceases
the
law
itself
ceases
has
overthrown
many
an
antiquated
rule
within
these
limits
it
is
conceived
that
there
is
range
enough
for
the
exercise
of
all
the
reason
of
the
advocate
and
the
judge
without
unsettling
everything
and
depriving
the
conduct
of
human
affairs
of
all
guidance
from
human
authority
and
the
talent
of
our
lawyers
and
courts
finds
sufficient
exercise
in
applying
the
principles
of
one
case
to
facts
of
the
station
which
lawyers
occupy
in
england
and
america
exercises
no
less
an
influence
upon
their
habits
and
their
opinions
the
english
aristocracy
which
has
taken
care
to
attract
to
its
sphere
whatever
is
at
all
analogous
to
itself
has
conferred
a
high
degree
of
importance
and
of
authority
upon
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
in
english
society
lawyers
do
not
occupy
the
first
rank
but
they
are
contented
with
the
station
assigned
to
them
they
constitute
as
it
were
the
younger
branch
of
the
english
aristocracy
and
they
are
attached
to
their
elder
brothers
although
they
do
not
enjoy
all
their
privileges
the
english
lawyers
consequently
mingle
the
tastes
and
the
ideas
of
the
aristocratic
circles
in
which
they
move
with
the
aristocratic
interest
of
their
profession
and
indeed
the
character
which
i
am
endeavoring
to
depict
is
most
distinctly
to
be
met
with
in
england
there
laws
are
esteemed
not
so
much
because
they
are
good
as
because
they
are
old
and
if
it
be
necessary
to
modify
them
in
any
respect
or
to
adapt
them
to
the
changes
which
time
operates
in
society
recourse
is
had
to
the
most
inconceivable
contrivances
in
order
to
uphold
the
traditionary
fabric
and
to
maintain
that
nothing
has
been
done
which
does
not
square
with
the
intentions
and
complete
the
labors
of
former
generations
the
very
individuals
who
conduct
these
changes
disclaim
all
intention
of
innovation
and
they
had
rather
resort
to
absurd
expedients
than
plead
guilty
of
so
great
a
crime
this
spirit
more
especially
appertains
to
the
english
lawyers
they
seem
indifferent
to
the
real
meaning
of
what
they
treat
and
they
direct
all
their
attention
to
the
letter
seeming
inclined
to
infringe
the
rules
of
common
sense
and
of
humanity
rather
than
to
swerve
one
tittle
from
the
law
the
english
legislation
may
be
compared
to
the
stock
of
an
old
tree
upon
which
lawyers
have
engrafted
the
most
various
shoots
with
the
hope
that
although
their
fruits
may
differ
their
foliage
at
least
will
be
confounded
with
the
venerable
trunk
which
supports
them
all
in
america
there
are
no
nobles
or
literary
men
and
the
people
is
apt
to
mistrust
the
wealthy
lawyers
consequently
form
the
highest
political
class
and
the
most
cultivated
circle
of
society
they
have
therefore
nothing
to
gain
by
innovation
which
adds
a
conservative
interest
to
their
natural
taste
for
public
order
if
i
were
asked
where
i
place
the
american
aristocracy
i
should
reply
without
hesitation
that
it
is
not
composed
of
the
rich
who
are
united
together
by
no
common
tie
but
that
it
occupies
the
judicial
bench
and
the
bar
the
more
we
reflect
upon
all
that
occurs
in
the
united
states
the
more
shall
we
be
persuaded
that
the
lawyers
as
a
body
form
the
most
powerful
if
not
the
only
counterpoise
to
the
democratic
element
in
that
country
we
perceive
how
eminently
the
legal
profession
is
qualified
by
its
powers
and
even
by
its
defects
to
neutralize
the
vices
which
are
inherent
in
popular
government
when
the
american
people
is
intoxicated
by
passion
or
carried
away
by
the
impetuosity
of
its
ideas
it
is
checked
and
stopped
by
the
almost
invisible
influence
of
its
legal
counsellors
who
secretly
oppose
their
aristocratic
propensities
to
its
democratic
instincts
their
superstitious
attachment
to
what
is
antique
to
its
love
of
novelty
their
narrow
views
to
its
immense
designs
and
their
habitual
procrastination
to
its
ardent
impatience
the
courts
of
justice
are
the
most
visible
organs
by
which
the
legal
profession
is
enabled
to
control
the
democracy
the
judge
is
a
lawyer
who
independently
of
the
taste
for
regularity
and
order
which
he
has
contracted
in
the
study
of
legislation
derives
an
additional
love
of
stability
from
his
own
inalienable
functions
his
legal
attainments
have
already
raised
him
to
a
distinguished
rank
among
his
his
political
power
completes
the
distinction
of
his
station
and
gives
him
the
inclinations
natural
to
privileged
classes
armed
with
the
power
of
declaring
the
laws
to
be
unconstitutional
the
american
magistrate
perpetually
interferes
in
political
affairs
he
can
not
force
the
people
to
make
laws
but
at
least
he
can
oblige
it
not
to
disobey
its
own
enactments
or
to
act
inconsistently
with
its
own
principles
i
am
aware
that
a
secret
tendency
to
diminish
the
judicial
power
exists
in
the
united
states
and
by
most
of
the
constitutions
of
the
several
states
the
government
can
upon
the
demand
of
the
two
houses
of
the
legislature
remove
the
judges
from
their
station
by
some
other
constitutions
the
members
of
the
tribunals
are
elected
and
they
are
even
subjected
to
frequent
i
venture
to
predict
that
these
innovations
will
sooner
or
later
be
attended
with
fatal
consequences
and
that
it
will
be
found
out
at
some
future
period
that
the
attack
which
is
made
upon
the
judicial
power
has
affected
the
democratic
republic
itself
it
must
not
however
be
supposed
that
the
legal
spirit
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
has
been
confined
in
the
united
states
to
the
courts
of
justice
it
extends
far
beyond
them
as
the
lawyers
constitute
the
only
enlightened
class
which
the
people
does
not
mistrust
they
are
naturally
called
upon
to
occupy
most
of
the
public
stations
they
fill
the
legislative
assemblies
and
they
conduct
the
administration
they
consequently
exercise
a
powerful
influence
upon
the
formation
of
the
law
and
upon
its
execution
the
lawyers
are
however
obliged
to
yield
to
the
current
of
public
opinion
which
is
too
strong
for
them
to
resist
it
but
it
is
easy
to
find
indications
of
what
their
conduct
would
be
if
they
were
free
to
act
as
they
chose
the
americans
who
have
made
such
copious
innovations
in
their
political
legislation
have
introduced
very
sparing
alterations
in
their
civil
laws
and
that
with
great
difficulty
although
those
laws
are
frequently
repugnant
to
their
social
condition
the
reason
of
this
is
that
in
matters
of
civil
law
the
majority
is
obliged
to
defer
to
the
authority
of
the
legal
profession
and
that
the
american
lawyers
are
disinclined
to
innovate
when
they
are
left
to
their
own
choice
it
is
curious
for
a
frenchman
accustomed
to
a
very
different
state
of
things
to
hear
the
perpetual
complaints
which
are
made
in
the
united
states
against
the
stationary
propensities
of
legal
men
and
their
prejudices
in
favor
of
existing
institutions
the
influence
of
the
legal
habits
which
are
common
in
america
extends
beyond
the
limits
i
have
just
pointed
out
scarcely
any
question
arises
in
the
united
states
which
does
not
become
sooner
or
later
a
subject
of
judicial
debate
hence
all
parties
are
obliged
to
borrow
the
ideas
and
even
the
language
usual
in
judicial
proceedings
in
their
daily
controversies
as
most
public
men
are
or
have
been
legal
practitioners
they
introduce
the
customs
and
technicalities
of
their
profession
into
the
affairs
of
the
country
the
jury
extends
this
habitude
to
all
classes
the
language
of
the
law
thus
becomes
in
some
measure
a
vulgar
tongue
the
spirit
of
the
law
which
is
produced
in
the
schools
and
courts
of
justice
gradually
penetrates
beyond
their
walls
into
the
bosom
of
society
where
it
descends
to
the
lowest
classes
so
that
the
whole
people
contracts
the
habits
and
the
tastes
of
the
magistrate
the
lawyers
of
the
united
states
form
a
party
which
is
but
little
feared
and
scarcely
perceived
which
has
no
badge
peculiar
to
itself
which
adapts
itself
with
great
flexibility
to
the
exigencies
of
the
time
and
accommodates
itself
to
all
the
movements
of
the
social
body
but
this
party
extends
over
the
whole
community
and
it
penetrates
into
all
classes
of
society
it
acts
upon
the
country
imperceptibly
but
it
finally
fashions
it
to
suit
its
purposes
trial
by
jury
in
the
united
states
considered
as
a
political
institution
trial
by
jury
which
is
one
of
the
instruments
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
deserves
to
be
compared
with
the
other
laws
which
establish
that
composition
of
the
jury
in
the
united
effect
of
trial
by
jury
upon
the
national
it
educates
the
it
tends
to
establish
the
authority
of
the
magistrates
and
to
extend
a
knowledge
of
law
among
the
people
since
i
have
been
led
by
my
subject
to
recur
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
united
states
i
will
not
pass
over
this
point
without
adverting
to
the
institution
of
the
jury
trial
by
jury
may
be
considered
in
two
separate
points
of
view
as
a
judicial
and
as
a
political
institution
if
it
entered
into
my
present
purpose
to
inquire
how
far
trial
by
jury
more
especially
in
civil
cases
contributes
to
ensure
the
best
administration
of
justice
i
admit
that
its
utility
might
be
contested
as
the
jury
was
first
introduced
at
a
time
when
society
was
in
an
uncivilized
state
and
when
courts
of
justice
were
merely
called
upon
to
decide
on
the
evidence
of
facts
it
is
not
an
easy
task
to
adapt
it
to
the
wants
of
a
highly
civilized
community
when
the
mutual
relations
of
men
are
multiplied
to
a
surprising
extent
and
have
assumed
the
enlightened
and
intellectual
character
of
the
age
my
present
object
is
to
consider
the
jury
as
a
political
institution
and
any
other
course
would
divert
me
from
my
subject
of
trial
by
jury
considered
as
a
judicial
institution
i
shall
here
say
but
very
few
words
when
the
english
adopted
trial
by
jury
they
were
a
people
they
are
become
in
course
of
time
one
of
the
most
enlightened
nations
of
the
earth
and
their
attachment
to
this
institution
seems
to
have
increased
with
their
increasing
cultivation
they
soon
spread
beyond
their
insular
boundaries
to
every
corner
of
the
habitable
globe
some
have
formed
colonies
others
independent
states
the
has
maintained
its
monarchical
constitution
many
of
its
offspring
have
founded
powerful
republics
but
wherever
the
english
have
been
they
have
boasted
of
the
privilege
of
trial
by
jury
they
have
established
it
or
hastened
to
it
in
all
their
settlements
a
judicial
institution
which
obtains
the
suffrages
of
a
great
people
for
so
long
a
series
of
ages
which
is
zealously
renewed
at
every
epoch
of
civilisation
in
all
the
climates
of
the
earth
and
under
every
form
of
human
government
can
not
be
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
justice
i
turn
however
from
this
part
of
the
subject
to
look
upon
the
jury
as
a
mere
judicial
institution
is
to
confine
our
attention
to
a
very
narrow
view
of
it
for
however
great
its
influence
may
be
upon
the
decisions
of
the
that
influence
is
very
subordinate
to
the
powerful
effects
which
it
produces
on
the
destinies
of
the
community
at
large
the
jury
is
above
all
a
political
institution
and
it
must
be
regarded
in
this
light
in
order
to
be
duly
appreciated
by
the
jury
i
mean
a
certain
number
of
citizens
chosen
indiscriminately
and
invested
with
a
temporary
right
of
judging
trial
by
jury
as
applied
to
the
repression
of
crime
appears
to
me
to
introduce
an
eminently
republican
element
into
the
government
upon
the
following
grounds
the
institution
of
the
jury
may
be
aristocratic
or
democratic
according
to
the
class
of
society
from
which
the
jurors
are
selected
but
it
always
preserves
its
republican
character
inasmuch
as
it
places
the
real
direction
of
society
in
the
hands
of
the
governed
or
of
a
portion
of
the
governed
instead
of
leaving
it
under
the
authority
of
the
government
force
is
never
more
than
a
transient
element
of
success
and
after
force
comes
the
notion
of
right
a
government
which
should
only
be
able
to
crush
its
enemies
upon
a
field
of
battle
would
very
soon
be
destroyed
the
true
sanction
of
political
laws
is
to
be
found
in
penal
legislation
and
if
that
sanction
be
wanting
the
law
will
sooner
or
later
lose
its
cogency
he
who
punishes
infractions
of
the
law
is
therefore
the
real
master
of
society
now
the
institution
of
the
jury
raises
the
people
itself
or
at
least
a
class
of
citizens
to
the
bench
of
judicial
authority
the
institution
of
the
jury
consequently
invests
the
people
or
that
class
of
citizens
with
the
direction
of
society
in
england
the
jury
is
returned
from
the
aristocratic
portion
of
the
nation
the
aristocracy
makes
the
laws
applies
the
laws
and
punishes
all
infractions
of
the
laws
everything
is
established
upon
a
consistent
footing
and
england
may
with
truth
be
said
to
constitute
an
aristocratic
republic
in
the
united
states
the
same
system
is
applied
to
the
whole
people
every
american
citizen
is
qualified
to
be
an
elector
a
juror
and
is
eligible
to
office
the
system
of
the
jury
as
it
is
understood
in
america
appears
to
me
to
be
as
direct
and
as
extreme
a
consequence
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
as
universal
suffrage
these
institutions
are
two
instruments
of
equal
power
which
contribute
to
the
supremacy
of
the
majority
all
the
sovereigns
who
have
chosen
to
govern
by
their
own
authority
and
to
direct
society
instead
of
obeying
its
direction
have
destroyed
or
enfeebled
the
institution
of
the
jury
the
monarchs
of
the
house
of
tudor
sent
to
prison
jurors
who
refused
to
convict
and
napoleon
caused
them
to
be
returned
by
his
agents
however
clear
most
of
these
truths
may
seem
to
be
they
do
not
command
universal
assent
and
in
france
at
least
the
institution
of
trial
by
jury
is
still
very
imperfectly
understood
if
the
question
arise
as
to
the
proper
qualification
of
jurors
it
is
confined
to
a
discussion
of
the
intelligence
and
knowledge
of
the
citizens
who
may
be
returned
as
if
the
jury
was
merely
a
judicial
institution
this
appears
to
me
to
be
the
least
part
of
the
subject
the
jury
is
a
political
institution
it
must
be
regarded
as
one
form
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
when
that
sovereignty
is
repudiated
it
must
be
rejected
or
it
must
be
adapted
to
the
laws
by
which
that
sovereignty
is
established
the
jury
is
that
portion
of
the
nation
to
which
the
execution
of
the
laws
is
intrusted
as
the
houses
of
parliament
constitute
that
part
of
the
nation
which
makes
the
laws
and
in
order
that
society
may
be
governed
with
consistency
and
uniformity
the
list
of
citizens
qualified
to
serve
on
juries
must
increase
and
diminish
with
the
list
of
electors
this
i
hold
to
be
the
point
of
view
must
worthy
of
the
attention
of
the
legislator
and
all
that
remains
is
merely
accessary
i
am
so
entirely
convinced
that
the
jury
is
a
political
institution
that
i
still
consider
it
in
this
light
when
it
is
applied
in
civil
causes
laws
are
always
unstable
unless
they
are
founded
upon
the
manners
of
a
nation
manners
are
the
only
durable
and
resisting
power
in
a
people
when
the
jury
is
reserved
for
criminal
offences
the
people
only
sees
its
occasional
action
in
certain
particular
cases
the
ordinary
course
of
life
goes
on
without
its
interference
and
it
is
considered
as
an
instrument
but
not
as
the
only
instrument
of
obtaining
justice
this
is
true
when
the
jury
is
only
applied
to
certain
criminal
causes
when
on
the
contrary
the
influence
of
the
jury
is
extended
to
civil
causes
its
application
is
constantly
palpable
it
affects
all
the
interests
of
the
community
every
one
in
its
work
it
thus
penetrates
into
all
the
usages
of
life
it
fashions
the
human
mind
to
its
peculiar
forms
and
is
gradually
associated
with
the
idea
of
justice
itself
the
institution
of
the
jury
if
confined
to
criminal
causes
is
always
in
danger
but
when
once
it
is
introduced
into
civil
proceedings
it
defies
the
aggressions
of
time
and
of
man
if
it
had
been
as
easy
to
remove
the
jury
from
the
manners
as
from
the
laws
of
england
it
would
have
perished
under
henry
viii
and
elizabeth
and
the
civil
jury
did
in
reality
at
that
period
save
the
liberties
of
the
country
in
whatever
manner
the
jury
be
applied
it
can
not
fail
to
exercise
a
powerful
influence
upon
the
national
character
but
this
influence
is
prodigiously
increased
when
it
is
introduced
into
civil
causes
the
jury
and
more
especially
the
civil
jury
serves
to
communicate
the
spirit
of
the
judges
to
the
minds
of
all
the
citizens
and
this
spirit
with
the
habits
which
attend
it
is
the
soundest
preparation
for
free
institutions
it
imbues
all
classes
with
a
respect
for
the
thing
judged
and
with
the
notion
of
right
if
these
two
elements
be
removed
the
love
of
independence
is
reduced
to
a
more
destructive
passion
it
teaches
men
to
practise
equity
every
man
learns
to
judge
his
neighbor
as
he
would
himself
be
judged
and
this
is
especially
true
of
the
jury
in
civil
causes
for
while
the
number
of
persons
who
have
reason
to
apprehend
a
criminal
prosecution
is
small
every
one
is
liable
to
have
a
civil
action
brought
against
him
the
jury
teaches
every
man
not
to
recoil
before
the
responsibility
of
his
own
actions
and
impresses
him
with
that
manly
confidence
without
which
political
virtue
can
not
exist
it
invests
each
citizen
with
a
kind
of
magistracy
it
makes
them
all
feel
the
duties
which
they
are
bound
to
discharge
toward
society
and
the
part
which
they
take
in
the
government
by
obliging
men
to
turn
their
attention
to
affairs
which
are
not
exclusively
their
own
it
rubs
off
that
individual
egotism
which
is
the
rust
of
society
the
jury
contributes
most
powerfully
to
form
the
judgment
and
to
increase
the
natural
intelligence
of
a
people
and
this
is
in
my
opinion
its
greatest
advantage
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
gratuitous
public
school
ever
open
in
which
every
juror
learns
to
exercise
his
rights
enters
into
daily
communication
with
the
most
learned
and
enlightened
members
of
the
upper
classes
and
becomes
practically
acquainted
with
the
laws
of
his
country
which
are
brought
within
the
reach
of
his
capacity
by
the
efforts
of
the
bar
the
advice
of
the
judge
and
even
by
the
passions
of
the
parties
i
think
that
the
practical
intelligence
and
political
good
sense
of
the
americans
are
mainly
attributable
to
the
long
use
which
they
have
made
of
the
jury
in
civil
causes
i
do
not
know
whether
the
jury
is
useful
to
those
who
are
in
litigation
but
i
am
certain
it
is
highly
beneficial
to
those
who
decide
the
litigation
and
i
look
upon
it
as
one
of
the
most
efficacious
means
for
the
education
of
the
people
which
society
can
employ
what
i
have
hitherto
said
applies
to
all
nations
but
the
remark
i
am
now
about
to
make
is
peculiar
to
the
americans
and
to
democratic
peoples
i
have
already
observed
that
in
democracies
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
and
the
magistrates
constitute
the
only
aristocratic
body
which
can
check
the
irregularities
of
the
people
this
aristocracy
is
invested
with
no
physical
power
but
it
exercises
its
conservative
influence
upon
the
minds
of
men
and
the
most
abundant
source
of
its
authority
is
the
institution
of
the
civil
jury
in
criminal
causes
when
society
is
armed
against
a
single
individual
the
jury
is
apt
to
look
upon
the
judge
as
the
passive
instrument
of
social
power
and
to
mistrust
his
advice
moreover
criminal
causes
are
entirely
founded
upon
the
evidence
of
facts
which
common
sense
can
readily
appreciate
upon
this
ground
the
judge
and
the
jury
are
equal
such
however
is
not
the
case
in
civil
causes
then
the
judge
appears
as
a
disinterested
arbiter
between
the
conflicting
passions
of
the
parties
the
jurors
look
up
to
him
with
confidence
and
listen
to
him
with
respect
for
in
this
instance
their
intelligence
is
completely
under
the
control
of
his
learning
it
is
the
judge
who
sums
up
the
various
arguments
with
which
their
memory
has
been
wearied
out
and
who
guides
them
through
the
devious
course
of
the
proceedings
he
points
their
attention
to
the
exact
question
of
fact
which
they
are
called
upon
to
solve
and
he
puts
the
answer
to
the
question
of
law
into
their
mouths
his
influence
upon
their
verdict
is
almost
unlimited
if
i
am
called
upon
to
explain
why
i
am
but
little
moved
by
the
arguments
derived
from
the
ignorance
of
jurors
in
civil
causes
i
reply
that
in
these
proceedings
whenever
the
question
to
be
solved
is
not
a
mere
question
of
fact
the
jury
has
only
the
semblance
of
a
judicial
body
the
jury
sanctions
the
decisions
of
the
judge
they
by
the
authority
of
society
which
they
represent
and
he
by
that
of
reason
and
of
law
in
england
and
in
america
the
judges
exercise
an
influence
upon
criminal
trials
which
the
french
judges
have
never
possessed
the
reason
of
this
difference
may
easily
be
discovered
the
english
and
american
magistrates
establish
their
authority
in
civil
causes
and
only
transfer
it
afterward
to
tribunals
of
another
kind
where
that
authority
was
not
acquired
in
some
cases
and
they
are
frequently
the
most
important
ones
the
american
judges
have
the
right
of
deciding
causes
alone
upon
these
occasions
they
are
accidentally
placed
in
the
position
which
the
french
judges
habitually
occupy
but
they
are
still
surrounded
by
the
reminiscence
of
the
jury
and
their
judgment
has
almost
as
much
authority
as
the
voice
of
the
community
at
large
represented
by
that
institution
their
influence
extends
beyond
the
limits
of
the
courts
in
the
recreations
of
private
life
as
well
as
in
the
turmoil
of
public
business
abroad
and
in
the
legislative
assemblies
the
american
judge
is
constantly
surrounded
by
men
who
are
accustomed
to
regard
his
intelligence
as
superior
to
their
own
and
after
having
exercised
his
power
in
the
decision
of
causes
he
continues
to
influence
the
habits
of
thought
and
the
character
of
the
individuals
who
took
a
part
in
his
judgment
the
remark
in
the
text
that
in
some
cases
and
they
are
frequently
the
most
important
ones
the
american
judges
have
the
right
of
deciding
causes
alone
and
the
author
note
that
the
federal
judges
decide
upon
their
own
authority
almost
all
the
questions
most
important
to
the
country
seem
to
require
explanation
in
consequence
of
their
connexion
with
the
context
in
which
the
author
is
speaking
of
the
trial
by
jury
they
seem
to
imply
that
there
are
some
cases
which
ought
to
be
tried
by
jury
that
are
decided
by
the
judges
it
is
believed
that
the
learned
author
although
a
distinguished
advocate
in
france
never
thoroughly
comprehended
the
grand
divisions
of
our
complicated
system
of
law
in
civil
cases
is
the
distinction
between
cases
in
equity
and
those
in
which
the
rules
of
the
common
law
those
in
equity
are
always
decided
by
the
judge
or
judges
who
however
send
questions
of
fact
to
be
tried
in
the
common
law
courts
by
a
jury
but
as
a
general
rule
this
is
entirely
in
the
discretion
of
the
equity
judge
in
cases
at
common
law
there
are
questions
of
fact
and
questions
of
law
the
former
are
invariably
tried
by
a
jury
the
latter
whether
presented
in
the
course
of
a
jury
trial
or
by
pleading
in
which
the
facts
are
admitted
are
always
decided
by
the
judges
cases
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
proceedings
of
an
analogous
nature
are
decided
by
the
judges
without
the
intervention
of
a
jury
the
cases
in
this
last
class
fall
within
the
peculiar
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
with
this
exception
the
federal
judges
do
not
decide
upon
their
own
authority
any
questions
which
if
presented
in
the
state
courts
would
not
also
be
decided
by
the
judges
of
those
courts
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
from
the
nature
of
its
institution
as
almost
wholly
an
appellant
court
is
called
on
to
decide
merely
questions
of
law
and
in
no
case
can
that
court
decide
a
question
of
fact
unless
it
arises
in
suits
peculiar
to
equity
or
admiralty
jurisdiction
indeed
the
author
original
note
is
more
correct
than
the
translation
it
is
as
follows
les
juges
fédéraux
tranchent
presque
toujours
seuls
les
questions
qui
touchent
de
plus
près
au
du
pays
and
it
is
very
true
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
particular
decides
those
questions
which
most
nearly
affect
the
of
the
country
because
those
are
the
very
questions
which
arise
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
laws
of
congress
and
of
the
several
states
the
final
and
conclusive
determination
of
which
is
vested
in
that
the
jury
then
which
seems
to
restrict
the
rights
of
magistracy
does
in
reality
consolidate
its
power
and
in
no
country
are
the
judges
so
powerful
as
there
where
the
people
partakes
their
privileges
it
is
more
especially
by
means
of
the
jury
in
civil
causes
that
the
american
magistrates
imbue
all
classes
of
society
with
the
spirit
of
their
profession
thus
the
jury
which
is
the
most
energetic
means
of
making
the
people
rule
is
also
the
most
efficacious
means
of
teaching
it
to
rule
well
notes
this
translation
does
not
accurately
convey
the
meaning
of
de
tocqueville
expression
he
says
ils
craignent
moins
la
tyrannie
que
et
pourvu
que
le
législateur
se
charge
aux
hommes
leur
indépendance
ils
sont
à
peu
près
content
the
more
correct
rendering
would
be
fear
tyranny
less
than
arbitrary
sway
and
provided
it
is
the
legislator
himself
who
undertakes
to
deprive
men

and
curious
subject

curious

as

if
it
were
our
province
to
point
out
the
utility
of
the
jury
as
a
judicial
institution
in
this
place
much
might
be
said
and
the
following
arguments
might
be
brought
forward
among
others
by
introducing
the
jury
into
the
business
of
the
courts
you
are
enabled
to
diminish
the
number
of
judges
which
is
a
very
great
advantage
when
judges
are
very
numerous
death
is
perpetually
thinning
the
ranks
of
the
judicial
functionaries
and
laying
places
vacant
for
new
comers
the
ambition
of
the
magistrates
is
therefore
continually
excited
and
they
are
naturally
made
dependant
upon
the
will
of
the
majority
or
the
individual
who
fills
up
vacant
appointments
the
officers
of
the
courts
then
rise
like
the
officers
of
an
army
this
state
of
things
is
entirely
contrary
to
the
sound
administration
of
justice
and
to
the
intentions
of
the
legislator
the
office
of
a
judge
is
made
inalienable
in
order
that
he
may
remain
independent
but
of
what
advantage
is
it
that
his
independence
is
protected
if
he
be
tempted
to
sacrifice
it
of
his
own
accord
when
judges
are
very
numerous
many
of
them
must
necessarily
be
incapable
of
performing
their
important
duties
for
a
great
magistrate
is
a
man
of
no
common
powers
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
a
half
enlightened
tribunal
is
the
worst
of
all
instruments
for
obtaining
those
objects
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
courts
of
justice
to
accomplish
for
my
own
part
i
had
rather
submit
the
decision
of
a
case
to
ignorant
jurors
directed
by
a
skilfull
judge
than
to
judges
a
majority
of
whom
are
imperfectly
acquainted
with
jurisprudence
and
with
the
laws
i
venture
to
remind
the
reader
lest
this
note
should
appear
somewhat
redundant
to
an
english
eye
that
the
jury
is
an
institution
which
has
only
been
naturalized
in
france
within
the
present
century
that
it
is
even
now
exclusively
applied
to
those
criminal
causes
which
come
before
the
courts
of
assize
or
to
the
prosecutions
of
the
public
press
and
that
the
judges
and
counsellors
of
the
numerous
local
tribunals
of
france
forming
a
body
of
many
thousand
judicial
functionaries
try
all
civil
causes
appeals
from
criminal
causes
and
minor
offences
without
the
an
important
remark
must
however
be
made
trial
by
jury
does
unquestionably
invest
the
people
with
a
general
control
over
the
actions
of
citizens
but
it
does
not
furnish
means
of
exercising
this
control
in
all
cases
or
with
an
absolute
authority
when
an
absolute
monarch
has
the
right
of
trying
offences
by
his
representatives
the
fate
of
the
prisoner
is
as
it
were
decided
beforehand
but
even
if
the
people
were
predisposed
to
convict
the
composition
and
the
of
the
jury
would
still
afford
some
chances
favorable
to
the
protection
of
innocence

qualification
of

to
account
for
the

several
of
the
causes

contribute

have

i
think
therefore
that
before
i
proceed
to
speak
of
the
future
i
can
not
do
better
than
collect
within
a
small
compass
the
reasons
which
best
explain
the
present
in
this
retrospective
chapter
i
shall
be
succinct
for
i
shall
take
care
to
remind
the
reader
very
summarily
of
what
he
already
knows
and
i
shall
only
select
the
most
prominent
of
those
facts
which
i
have
not
yet
pointed
out
all
the
causes
which
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
the
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
are
reducible
to
three
heads
i
the
peculiar
and
accidental
situation
in
which
providence
has
placed
the
americans
ii
the
laws
iii
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
people
accidental
or
providential
causes
which
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
the
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
the
union
has
no
no
the
americans
have
had
the
chances
of
birth
in
their
america
an
empty
how
this
circumstance
contributes
powerfully
to
the
maintenance
of
the
democratic
republic
in
how
the
american
wilds
are
avidity
of
the
in
taking
possession
of
the
solitudes
of
the
new
influence
of
physical
prosperity
upon
the
political
opinions
of
the
americans
a
thousand
circumstances
independent
of
the
will
of
man
concur
to
facilitate
the
maintenance
of
a
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
some
of
these
peculiarities
are
known
the
others
may
easily
be
pointed
out
but
i
shall
confine
myself
to
the
most
prominent
among
them
the
americans
have
no
neighbors
and
consequently
they
have
no
great
wars
or
financial
crises
or
inroads
or
conquests
to
dread
they
require
neither
great
taxes
nor
great
armies
nor
great
generals
and
they
have
nothing
to
fear
from
a
scourge
which
is
more
formidable
to
republics
than
all
these
evils
combined
namely
military
glory
it
is
impossible
to
deny
the
inconceivable
influence
which
military
glory
exercises
upon
the
spirit
of
a
nation
general
jackson
whom
the
americans
have
twice
elected
to
be
the
head
of
their
government
is
a
man
of
violent
temper
and
mediocre
talents
no
one
circumstance
in
the
whole
course
of
his
career
ever
proved
that
he
is
qualified
to
govern
a
free
people
and
indeed
the
majority
of
the
enlightened
classes
of
the
union
has
always
been
opposed
to
him
but
he
was
raised
to
the
presidency
and
has
been
maintained
in
that
lofty
station
solely
by
the
recollection
of
a
victory
which
he
gained
twenty
years
ago
under
the
walls
of
new
orleans
a
victory
which
was
however
a
very
ordinary
achievement
and
which
could
only
be
remembered
in
a
country
where
battles
are
rare
now
the
people
who
are
thus
carried
away
by
the
illusions
of
glory
are
unquestionably
the
most
cold
and
calculating
the
most
unmilitary
if
i
may
use
the
expression
and
the
most
prosaic
of
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
america
has
no
great
capital
city
whose
influence
is
directly
or
indirectly
felt
over
the
whole
extent
of
the
country
which
i
hold
to
be
one
of
the
first
causes
of
the
maintenance
of
republican
institutions
in
the
united
states
in
cities
men
can
not
be
prevented
from
concerting
together
and
from
awakening
a
mutual
excitement
which
prompts
sudden
and
passionate
resolutions
cities
may
be
looked
upon
as
large
assemblies
of
which
all
the
inhabitants
are
members
their
populace
exercises
a
prodigious
influence
upon
the
magistrates
and
frequently
executes
its
own
wishes
without
their
intervention
to
subject
the
provinces
to
the
metropolis
is
therefore
not
only
to
place
the
destiny
of
the
empire
in
the
hands
of
a
portion
of
the
community
which
may
be
reprobated
as
unjust
but
to
place
it
in
the
hands
of
a
populace
acting
under
its
own
impulses
which
must
be
avoided
as
dangerous
the
preponderance
of
capital
cities
is
therefore
a
serious
blow
upon
the
representative
system
and
it
exposes
modern
republics
to
the
same
defect
as
the
republics
of
antiquity
which
all
perished
from
not
being
acquainted
with
that
system
it
would
be
easy
for
me
to
adduce
a
great
number
of
secondary
causes
which
have
contributed
to
establish
and
which
concur
to
maintain
the
democratic
republic
of
the
united
states
but
i
discern
two
principal
circumstances
among
these
favorable
elements
which
i
hasten
to
point
out
i
have
already
observed
that
the
origin
of
the
american
settlements
may
be
looked
upon
as
the
first
and
most
efficacious
cause
to
which
the
present
prosperity
of
the
united
states
may
be
attributed
the
americans
had
the
chances
of
birth
in
their
favor
and
their
forefathers
imported
that
equality
of
conditions
into
the
country
whence
the
democratic
republic
has
very
naturally
taken
its
rise
nor
was
this
all
they
did
for
besides
this
republican
condition
of
society
the
early
settlers
bequeathed
to
their
descendants
those
customs
manners
and
opinions
which
contribute
most
to
the
success
of
a
republican
form
of
government
when
i
reflect
upon
the
consequences
of
this
primary
circumstance
methinks
i
see
the
destiny
of
america
embodied
in
the
first
puritan
who
landed
on
those
shores
just
as
the
human
race
was
represented
by
the
first
man
the
chief
circumstance
which
has
favored
the
establishment
and
the
maintenance
of
a
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
is
the
nature
of
the
territory
which
the
americans
inhabit
their
ancestors
gave
them
the
love
of
equality
and
of
freedom
but
god
himself
gave
them
the
means
of
remaining
equal
and
free
by
placing
them
upon
a
boundless
continent
which
is
open
to
their
exertions
general
prosperity
is
favorable
to
the
stability
of
all
governments
but
more
particularly
of
a
democratic
constitution
which
depends
upon
the
disposition
of
the
majority
and
more
particularly
of
that
portion
of
the
community
which
is
most
exposed
to
feel
the
pressure
of
want
when
the
people
rules
it
must
be
rendered
happy
or
it
will
overturn
the
state
and
misery
is
apt
to
stimulate
it
to
those
excesses
to
which
ambition
rouses
kings
the
physical
causes
independent
of
the
laws
which
contribute
to
promote
general
prosperity
are
more
numerous
in
america
than
they
have
ever
been
in
any
other
country
in
the
world
at
any
other
period
of
history
in
the
united
states
not
only
is
legislation
democratic
but
nature
herself
favors
the
cause
of
the
people
in
what
part
of
human
tradition
can
be
found
anything
at
all
similar
to
that
which
is
occurring
under
our
eyes
in
north
america
the
celebrated
communities
of
antiquity
were
all
founded
in
the
midst
of
hostile
nations
which
they
were
obliged
to
subjugate
before
they
could
flourish
in
their
place
even
the
moderns
have
found
in
some
parts
of
south
america
vast
regions
inhabited
by
a
people
of
inferior
civilisation
but
which
occupied
and
cultivated
the
soil
to
found
their
new
states
it
was
necessary
to
extirpate
or
to
subdue
a
numerous
population
until
civilisation
has
been
made
to
blush
for
their
success
but
north
america
was
only
inhabited
by
wandering
tribes
who
took
no
thought
of
the
natural
riches
of
the
soil
and
that
vast
country
was
still
properly
speaking
an
empty
continent
a
desert
land
awaiting
its
inhabitants
everything
is
extraordinary
in
america
the
social
condition
of
the
inhabitants
as
well
as
the
laws
but
the
soil
upon
which
these
institutions
are
founded
is
more
extraordinary
than
all
the
rest
when
man
was
first
placed
upon
the
earth
by
the
creator
that
earth
was
inexhaustible
in
its
youth
but
man
was
weak
and
ignorant
and
when
he
had
learned
to
explore
the
treasures
which
it
contained
hosts
of
his
covered
its
surface
and
he
was
obliged
to
earn
an
asylum
for
repose
and
for
freedom
by
the
sword
at
that
same
period
north
america
was
discovered
as
if
it
had
been
kept
in
reserve
by
the
deity
and
had
just
risen
from
beneath
the
waters
of
the
deluge
that
continent
still
presents
as
it
did
in
the
primeval
time
rivers
which
rise
from
sources
green
and
moist
solitudes
and
fields
which
the
ploughshare
of
the
husbandman
has
never
turned
in
this
state
it
is
offered
to
man
not
in
the
barbarous
and
isolated
condition
of
the
early
ages
but
to
a
being
who
is
already
in
possession
of
the
most
potent
secrets
of
the
natural
world
who
is
united
to
his
and
instructed
by
the
experience
of
fifty
centuries
at
this
very
time
thirteen
millions
of
civilized
europeans
are
peaceably
spreading
over
those
fertile
plains
with
whose
resources
and
whose
extent
they
are
not
yet
accurately
acquainted
three
or
four
thousand
soldiers
drive
the
wandering
races
of
the
aborigines
before
them
these
are
followed
by
the
pioneers
who
pierce
the
woods
scare
off
the
beasts
of
prey
explore
the
courses
of
the
inland
streams
and
make
ready
the
triumphal
procession
of
civilisation
across
the
waste
the
favorable
influence
of
the
temporal
prosperity
of
america
upon
the
institutions
of
that
country
has
been
so
often
described
by
others
and
adverted
to
by
myself
that
i
shall
not
enlarge
upon
it
beyond
the
addition
of
a
few
facts
an
erroneous
notion
is
generally
entertained
that
the
deserts
of
america
are
peopled
by
european
emigrants
who
annually
disembark
upon
the
coasts
of
the
new
world
while
the
american
population
increases
and
multiplies
upon
the
soil
which
its
forefathers
tilled
the
european
settler
however
usually
arrives
in
the
united
states
without
friends
and
sometimes
without
resources
in
order
to
subsist
he
is
obliged
to
work
for
hire
and
he
rarely
proceeds
beyond
that
belt
of
industrious
population
which
adjoins
the
ocean
the
desert
can
not
be
explored
without
capital
or
credit
and
the
body
must
be
accustomed
to
the
rigors
of
a
new
climate
before
it
can
be
exposed
to
the
chances
of
forest
life
it
is
the
americans
themselves
who
daily
quit
the
spots
which
gave
them
birth
to
acquire
extensive
domains
in
a
remote
country
thus
the
european
leaves
his
country
for
the
transatlantic
shores
and
the
american
who
is
born
on
that
very
coast
plunges
into
the
wilds
of
central
america
this
double
emigration
is
incessant
it
begins
in
the
remotest
parts
of
europe
it
crosses
the
atlantic
ocean
and
it
advances
over
the
solitudes
of
the
new
world
millions
of
men
are
marching
at
once
toward
the
same
horizon
their
language
their
religion
their
manners
differ
their
object
is
the
same
the
gifts
of
fortune
are
promised
in
the
west
and
to
the
west
they
bend
their
course
no
event
can
be
compared
with
this
continuous
removal
of
the
human
race
except
perhaps
those
irruptions
which
preceded
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
then
as
well
as
now
generations
of
men
were
impelled
forward
in
the
same
direction
to
meet
and
struggle
on
the
same
spot
but
the
designs
of
providence
were
not
the
same
then
every
new
comer
was
the
harbinger
of
destruction
and
of
death
now
every
adventurer
brings
with
him
the
elements
of
prosperity
and
of
life
the
future
still
conceals
from
us
the
ulterior
consequences
of
this
emigration
of
the
american
toward
the
west
but
we
can
hardly
apprehend
its
more
immediate
results
as
a
portion
of
the
inhabitants
annually
leave
the
states
in
which
they
were
born
the
population
of
these
states
increases
very
slowly
although
they
have
long
been
established
thus
in
connecticut
which
only
contains
inhabitants
to
the
square
mile
the
population
has
not
been
increased
by
more
than
one
quarter
in
forty
years
while
that
of
england
has
been
augmented
by
one
third
in
the
lapse
of
the
same
period
the
european
emigrant
always
lands
therefore
in
a
country
which
is
but
half
full
and
where
hands
are
in
request
he
becomes
a
workman
in
easy
circumstances
his
son
goes
to
seek
his
fortune
in
unpeopled
regions
and
he
becomes
a
rich
landowner
the
former
amasses
the
capital
which
the
latter
invests
and
the
stranger
as
well
as
the
native
is
unacquainted
with
want
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
extremely
favorable
to
the
division
of
property
but
a
cause
which
is
more
powerful
than
the
laws
prevents
property
from
being
divided
to
excess
this
is
very
perceptible
in
the
states
which
are
beginning
to
be
thickly
peopled
massachusetts
is
the
most
populous
part
of
the
union
but
it
contains
only
inhabitants
to
the
square
mile
which
is
much
less
than
in
france
where
are
reckoned
to
the
same
extent
of
country
but
in
massachusetts
estates
are
very
rarely
divided
the
eldest
son
takes
the
land
and
the
others
go
to
seek
their
fortune
in
the
desert
the
law
has
abolished
the
right
of
primogeniture
but
circumstances
have
concurred
to
it
under
a
form
of
which
none
can
complain
and
by
which
no
just
rights
are
impaired
a
single
fact
will
suffice
to
show
the
prodigious
number
of
individuals
who
leave
new
england
in
this
manner
to
settle
themselves
in
the
wilds
we
were
assured
in
that
of
the
members
of
congress
were
born
in
the
little
state
of
connecticut
the
population
of
connecticut
which
constitutes
only
one
part
of
that
of
the
united
states
thus
furnished
of
the
whole
body
of
representatives
the
state
of
connecticut
however
only
sends
five
delegates
to
congress
and
the
others
sit
for
the
new
western
states
if
these
individuals
had
remained
in
connecticut
it
is
probable
that
instead
of
becoming
rich
landowners
they
would
have
remained
humble
laborers
that
they
would
have
lived
in
obscurity
without
being
able
to
rise
into
public
life
and
that
far
from
becoming
useful
members
of
the
legislature
they
might
have
been
unruly
citizens
these
reflections
do
not
escape
the
observation
of
the
americans
any
more
than
of
ourselves
it
can
not
be
doubted
says
chancellor
kent
in
his
treatise
on
american
law
that
the
division
of
landed
estates
must
produce
great
evils
when
it
is
carried
to
such
excess
that
each
parcel
of
land
is
insufficient
to
support
a
family
but
these
disadvantages
have
never
been
felt
in
the
united
states
and
many
generations
must
elapse
before
they
can
be
felt
the
extent
of
our
inhabited
territory
the
abundance
of
adjacent
land
and
the
continual
stream
of
emigration
flowing
from
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
toward
the
interior
of
the
country
suffice
as
yet
and
will
long
suffice
to
prevent
the
parcelling
out
of
estates
it
is
difficult
to
describe
the
rapacity
with
which
the
american
rushes
forward
to
secure
the
immense
booty
which
fortune
proffers
to
him
in
the
pursuit
he
fearlessly
braves
the
arrow
of
the
indian
and
the
distempers
of
the
forest
he
is
unimpressed
by
the
silence
of
the
woods
the
approach
of
beasts
of
prey
does
not
disturb
him
for
he
is
goaded
onward
by
a
passion
more
intense
than
the
love
of
life
before
him
lies
a
boundless
continent
and
he
urges
onward
as
if
time
pressed
and
he
was
afraid
of
finding
no
room
for
his
exertions
i
have
spoken
of
the
emigration
from
the
older
states
but
how
shall
i
describe
that
which
takes
place
from
the
more
recent
ones
fifty
years
have
scarcely
elapsed
since
that
of
ohio
was
founded
the
greater
part
of
its
inhabitants
were
not
born
within
its
confines
its
capital
has
only
been
built
thirty
years
and
its
territory
is
still
covered
by
an
immense
extent
of
uncultivated
fields
nevertheless
the
population
of
ohio
is
already
proceeding
westward
and
most
of
the
settlers
who
descend
to
the
fertile
savannahs
of
illinois
are
citizens
of
ohio
these
men
left
their
first
country
to
improve
their
condition
they
quit
their
to
meliorate
it
still
more
fortune
awaits
them
everywhere
but
happiness
they
can
not
attain
the
desire
of
prosperity
has
become
an
ardent
and
restless
passion
in
their
minds
which
grows
by
what
it
gains
they
early
broke
the
ties
which
bound
them
to
their
natal
earth
and
they
have
contracted
no
fresh
ones
on
their
way
emigration
was
at
first
necessary
to
them
as
a
means
of
subsistence
and
it
soon
becomes
a
sort
of
game
of
chance
which
they
pursue
for
the
emotions
it
excites
as
much
as
for
the
gain
it
procures
sometimes
the
progress
of
man
is
so
rapid
that
the
desert
reappears
behind
him
the
woods
stoop
to
give
him
a
passage
and
spring
up
again
when
he
has
passed
it
is
not
uncommon
in
crossing
the
new
states
of
the
west
to
meet
with
deserted
dwellings
in
the
midst
of
the
wilds
the
traveller
frequently
discovers
the
vestiges
of
a
in
the
most
solitary
retreats
which
bear
witness
to
the
power
and
no
less
to
the
inconstancy
of
man
in
these
abandoned
fields
and
over
those
ruins
of
a
day
the
primeval
forest
soon
scatters
a
fresh
vegetation
the
beasts
resume
the
haunts
which
were
once
their
own
and
nature
covers
the
traces
of
man
path
with
branches
and
with
flowers
which
obliterate
his
evanescent
track
i
remember
that
in
crossing
one
of
the
woodland
districts
which
still
cover
the
state
of
new
york
i
reached
the
shore
of
a
lake
which
was
embosomed
with
forests
coeval
with
the
world
a
small
island
covered
with
woods
whose
thick
foliage
concealed
its
banks
rose
from
the
centre
of
the
waters
upon
the
shores
of
the
lake
no
object
attested
the
presence
of
man
except
a
column
of
smoke
which
might
be
seen
on
the
horizon
rising
from
the
tops
of
the
trees
to
the
clouds
and
seeming
to
hang
from
heaven
rather
than
to
be
mounting
to
the
sky
an
indian
shallop
was
hauled
up
on
the
sand
which
tempted
me
to
visit
the
islet
that
had
at
first
attracted
my
attention
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
set
foot
upon
its
banks
the
whole
island
formed
one
of
those
delicious
solitudes
of
the
new
world
which
almost
lead
civilized
man
to
regret
the
haunts
of
the
savage
a
luxuriant
vegetation
bore
witness
to
the
incomparable
fruitfulness
of
the
soil
the
deep
silence
which
is
common
to
the
wilds
of
north
america
was
only
broken
by
the
hoarse
cooing
of
the
and
the
tapping
of
the
woodpecker
upon
the
bark
of
trees
i
was
far
from
supposing
that
this
spot
had
ever
been
inhabited
so
completely
did
nature
seem
to
be
left
to
her
own
caprices
but
when
i
reached
the
centre
of
the
isle
i
thought
that
i
discovered
some
traces
of
man
i
then
proceeded
to
examine
the
surrounding
objects
with
care
and
i
soon
perceived
that
an
european
had
undoubtedly
been
led
to
seek
a
refuge
in
this
retreat
yet
what
changes
had
taken
place
in
the
scene
of
his
labors
the
logs
which
he
had
hastily
hewn
to
build
himself
a
shed
had
sprouted
afresh
the
very
props
were
intertwined
with
living
verdure
and
his
cabin
was
transformed
into
a
bower
in
the
midst
of
these
shrubs
a
few
stones
were
to
be
seen
blackened
with
fire
and
sprinkled
with
thin
ashes
here
the
hearth
had
no
doubt
been
and
the
chimney
in
falling
had
covered
it
with
rubbish
i
stood
for
some
time
in
silent
admiration
of
the
exuberance
of
nature
and
the
littleness
of
man
and
when
i
was
obliged
to
leave
that
enchanting
solitude
i
exclaimed
with
melancholy
are
ruins
then
already
here
in
europe
we
are
wont
to
look
upon
a
restless
disposition
an
unbounded
desire
of
riches
and
an
excessive
love
of
independence
as
propensities
very
formidable
to
society
yet
these
are
the
very
elements
which
ensure
a
long
and
peaceful
duration
to
the
republics
of
america
without
these
unquiet
passions
the
population
would
collect
in
certain
spots
and
would
soon
be
subject
to
wants
like
those
of
the
old
world
which
it
is
difficult
to
satisfy
for
such
is
the
present
good
fortune
of
the
new
world
that
the
vices
of
its
inhabitants
are
scarcely
less
favorable
to
society
than
their
virtues
these
circumstances
exercise
a
great
influence
on
the
estimation
in
which
human
actions
are
held
in
the
two
hemispheres
the
americans
frequently
term
what
we
should
call
cupidity
a
laudable
industry
and
they
blame
as
what
we
consider
to
be
the
virtue
of
moderate
desires
in
france
simple
tastes
orderly
manners
domestic
affections
and
the
attachment
which
men
feel
to
the
place
of
their
birth
are
looked
upon
as
great
guarantees
of
the
tranquillity
and
happiness
of
the
state
but
in
america
nothing
seems
to
be
more
prejudicial
to
society
than
these
virtues
the
french
canadians
who
have
faithfully
preserved
the
traditions
of
their
pristine
manners
are
already
embarrassed
for
room
upon
their
small
territory
and
this
little
community
which
has
so
recently
begun
to
exist
will
shortly
be
a
prey
to
the
calamities
incident
to
old
nations
in
canada
the
most
enlightened
patriotic
and
humane
inhabitants
make
extraordinary
efforts
to
render
the
people
dissatisfied
with
those
simple
enjoyments
which
still
content
it
there
the
seductions
of
wealth
are
vaunted
with
as
much
zeal
as
the
charms
of
an
honest
but
limited
income
in
the
old
world
and
more
exertions
are
made
to
excite
the
passions
of
the
citizens
there
than
to
calm
them
elsewhere
if
we
listen
to
the
eulogies
we
shall
hear
that
nothing
is
more
praiseworthy
than
to
exchange
the
pure
and
homely
pleasures
which
even
the
poor
man
tastes
in
his
own
country
for
the
dull
delights
of
prosperity
under
a
foreign
sky
to
leave
the
patrimonial
hearth
and
the
turf
beneath
which
his
forefathers
sleep
in
short
to
abandon
the
living
and
the
dead
in
quest
of
fortune
at
the
present
time
america
presents
a
field
for
human
effort
far
more
extensive
than
any
sum
of
labor
which
can
be
applied
to
work
it
in
america
too
much
knowledge
can
not
be
diffused
for
all
knowledge
while
it
may
serve
him
who
possesses
it
turns
also
to
the
advantage
of
those
who
are
without
it
new
wants
are
not
to
be
feared
since
they
can
be
satisfied
without
difficulty
the
growth
of
human
passions
need
not
be
dreaded
since
all
passions
may
find
an
easy
and
a
legitimate
object
nor
can
men
be
put
in
possession
of
too
much
freedom
since
they
are
scarcely
ever
tempted
to
misuse
their
liberties
the
american
republics
of
the
present
day
are
like
companies
of
adventurers
formed
to
explore
in
common
the
waste
lands
of
the
new
world
and
busied
in
a
flourishing
trade
the
passions
which
agitate
the
americans
most
deeply
are
not
their
political
but
their
commercial
passions
or
to
speak
more
correctly
they
introduce
the
habits
they
contract
in
business
into
their
political
life
they
love
order
without
which
affairs
do
not
prosper
and
they
set
an
especial
value
upon
a
regular
conduct
which
is
the
foundation
of
a
solid
business
they
prefer
the
good
sense
which
amasses
large
fortunes
to
that
enterprising
spirit
which
frequently
dissipates
them
general
ideas
alarm
their
minds
which
are
accustomed
to
positive
calculations
and
they
hold
practice
in
more
honor
than
theory
it
is
in
america
that
one
learns
to
understand
the
influence
which
physical
prosperity
exercises
over
political
actions
and
even
over
opinions
which
ought
to
acknowledge
no
sway
but
that
of
reason
and
it
is
more
especially
among
strangers
that
this
truth
is
perceptible
most
of
the
european
emigrants
to
the
new
world
carry
with
them
that
wild
love
of
independence
and
of
change
which
our
calamities
are
apt
to
engender
i
sometimes
met
with
europeans
in
the
united
states
who
had
been
obliged
to
leave
their
own
country
on
account
of
their
political
opinions
they
all
astonished
me
by
the
language
they
held
but
one
of
them
surprised
me
more
than
all
the
rest
as
i
was
crossing
one
of
the
most
remote
districts
of
pennsylvania
i
was
benighted
and
obliged
to
beg
for
hospitality
at
the
gate
of
a
wealthy
planter
who
was
a
frenchman
by
birth
he
bade
me
sit
down
beside
his
fire
and
we
began
to
talk
with
that
freedom
which
befits
persons
who
meet
in
the
backwoods
two
thousand
leagues
from
their
native
country
i
was
aware
that
my
host
had
been
a
great
leveller
and
an
ardent
demagogue
forty
years
ago
and
that
his
name
was
not
unknown
to
fame
i
was
therefore
not
a
little
surprised
to
hear
him
discuss
the
rights
of
property
as
an
economist
or
a
landowner
might
have
done
he
spoke
of
the
necessary
gradations
which
fortune
established
among
men
of
obedience
to
established
laws
of
the
influence
of
good
morals
in
commonwealths
and
of
the
support
which
religious
opinions
give
to
order
and
to
freedom
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
quote
an
evangelical
authority
in
corroboration
of
one
of
his
political
tenets
i
listened
and
marvelled
at
the
feebleness
of
human
reason
a
proposition
is
true
or
false
but
no
art
can
prove
it
to
be
one
or
the
other
in
the
midst
of
the
uncertainties
of
science
and
the
conflicting
lessons
of
experience
until
a
new
incident
disperses
the
clouds
of
doubt
i
was
poor
i
become
rich
and
i
am
not
to
expect
that
prosperity
will
act
upon
my
conduct
and
leave
my
judgment
free
my
opinions
change
with
my
fortune
and
the
happy
circumstances
which
i
turn
to
my
advantage
furnish
me
with
that
decisive
argument
which
was
before
wanting
the
sentence
beginning
i
was
poor
i
become
rich
c
struck
the
editor
on
perusal
as
obscure
if
not
contradictory
the
original
seems
more
explicit
and
justice
to
the
author
seems
to
require
that
it
should
be
presented
to
the
reader

influence
of
the

upon
the
maintenance
of
the
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
three
principal
causes
of
the
maintenance
of
the
democratic
federal
municipal
judicial
power
the
principal
aim
of
this
book
has
been
to
make
known
the
laws
of
the
united
states
if
this
purpose
has
been
accomplished
the
reader
is
already
enabled
to
judge
for
himself
which
are
the
laws
that
really
tend
to
maintain
the
democratic
republic
and
which
endanger
its
existence
if
i
have
not
succeeded
in
explaining
this
in
the
whole
course
of
my
work
i
can
not
hope
to
do
so
within
the
limits
of
a
single
chapter
it
is
not
my
intention
to
retrace
the
path
i
have
already
pursued
and
a
very
few
lines
will
suffice
to
recapitulate
what
i
have
previously
explained
three
circumstances
seem
to
me
to
contribute
most
powerfully
to
the
maintenance
of
the
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
the
first
is
that
federal
form
of
government
which
the
americans
have
adopted
and
which
enables
the
union
to
combine
the
power
of
a
great
empire
with
the
security
of
a
small
state
the
second
consists
in
those
municipal
institutions
which
limit
the
despotism
of
the
majority
and
at
the
same
time
impart
a
taste
for
freedom
and
a
knowledge
of
the
art
of
being
free
to
the
people
the
third
is
to
be
met
with
in
the
constitution
of
the
judicial
power
i
have
shown
in
what
manner
the
courts
of
justice
serve
to
repress
the
excesses
of
democracy
and
how
they
check
and
direct
the
impulses
of
the
majority
without
stopping
its
activity
influence
of
manners
upon
the
maintenance
of
the
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
i
have
previously
remarked
that
the
manners
of
the
people
may
be
considered
as
one
of
the
general
causes
to
which
the
maintenance
of
a
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
is
attributable
i
here
use
the
word
with
the
meaning
which
the
ancients
attached
to
the
word
for
i
apply
it
not
only
to
manners
in
their
proper
sense
of
what
constitutes
the
character
of
social
intercourse
but
i
extend
it
to
the
various
notions
and
opinions
current
among
men
and
to
the
mass
of
those
ideas
which
constitute
their
character
of
mind
i
comprise
therefore
under
this
term
the
whole
moral
and
intellectual
condition
of
a
people
my
intention
is
not
to
draw
a
picture
of
american
manners
but
simply
to
point
out
such
features
of
them
as
are
favorable
to
the
maintenance
of
political
institutions
religion
considered
as
a
political
institution
which
powerfully
contributes
to
the
maintenance
of
the
democratic
republic
among
the
americans
north
america
peopled
by
men
who
professed
a
democratic
and
republican
arrival
of
the
for
what
reason
the
catholics
form
the
most
democratic
and
the
most
republican
class
at
the
present
time
every
religion
is
to
be
found
in
juxtaposition
to
a
political
opinion
which
is
connected
with
it
by
affinity
if
the
human
mind
be
left
to
follow
its
own
bent
it
will
regulate
the
temporal
and
spiritual
institutions
of
society
upon
one
uniform
principle
and
man
will
endeavor
if
i
may
use
the
expression
to
harmonize
the
state
in
which
he
lives
upon
earth
with
the
state
he
believes
to
await
him
in
heaven
the
greatest
part
of
british
america
was
peopled
by
men
who
after
having
shaken
off
the
authority
of
the
pope
acknowledged
no
other
religious
supremacy
they
brought
with
them
into
the
new
world
a
form
of
christianity
which
i
can
not
better
describe
than
by
styling
it
a
democratic
and
republican
religion
this
sect
contributed
powerfully
to
the
establishment
of
a
democracy
and
a
republic
and
from
the
earliest
settlement
of
the
emigrants
politics
and
religion
contracted
an
alliance
which
has
never
been
dissolved
about
fifty
years
ago
ireland
began
to
pour
a
catholic
population
into
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand
the
catholics
of
america
made
proselytes
and
at
the
present
moment
more
than
a
million
of
christians
professing
the
truths
of
the
church
of
rome
are
to
be
met
with
in
the
union
these
catholics
are
faithful
to
the
observances
of
their
religion
they
are
fervent
and
zealous
in
the
support
and
belief
of
their
doctrines
nevertheless
they
constitute
the
most
republican
and
the
most
democratic
class
of
citizens
which
exists
in
the
united
states
and
although
this
fact
may
surprise
the
observer
at
first
the
cause
by
which
it
is
occasioned
may
easily
be
discovered
upon
reflection
i
think
that
the
catholic
religion
has
erroneously
been
looked
upon
as
the
natural
enemy
of
democracy
among
the
various
sects
of
christians
catholicism
seems
to
me
on
the
contrary
to
be
one
of
those
which
are
most
favorable
to
the
equality
of
conditions
in
the
catholic
church
the
religious
community
is
composed
of
only
two
elements
the
priest
and
the
people
the
priest
alone
rises
above
the
rank
of
his
flock
and
all
below
him
are
equal
on
doctrinal
points
the
catholic
faith
places
all
human
capacities
upon
the
same
level
it
subjects
the
wise
and
the
ignorant
the
man
of
genius
and
the
vulgar
crowd
to
the
details
of
the
same
creed
it
imposes
the
same
observances
upon
the
rich
and
needy
it
inflicts
the
same
austerities
upon
the
strong
and
the
weak
it
listens
to
no
compromises
with
mortal
man
but
reducing
all
the
human
race
to
the
same
standard
it
confounds
all
the
distinctions
of
society
at
the
foot
of
the
same
altar
even
as
they
are
confounded
in
the
sight
of
god
if
catholicism
predisposes
the
faithful
to
obedience
it
certainly
does
not
prepare
them
for
inequality
but
the
contrary
may
be
said
of
protestantism
which
generally
tends
to
make
men
independent
more
than
to
render
them
equal
catholicism
is
like
an
absolute
monarchy
if
the
sovereign
be
removed
all
the
other
classes
of
society
are
more
equal
than
they
are
in
republics
it
has
not
unfrequently
occurred
that
the
catholic
priest
has
left
the
service
of
the
altar
to
mix
with
the
governing
powers
of
society
and
to
make
his
place
among
the
civil
gradations
of
men
this
religious
influence
has
sometimes
been
used
to
secure
the
interests
of
that
political
state
of
things
to
which
he
belonged
at
other
times
catholics
have
taken
the
side
of
aristocracy
from
a
spirit
of
religion
but
no
sooner
is
the
priesthood
entirely
separated
from
the
government
as
is
the
case
in
the
united
states
than
it
is
found
that
no
class
of
men
are
more
naturally
disposed
than
the
catholics
to
transfuse
the
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
conditions
into
the
political
world
if
then
the
catholic
citizens
of
the
united
states
are
not
forcibly
led
by
the
nature
of
their
tenets
to
adopt
democratic
and
republican
principles
at
least
they
are
not
necessarily
opposed
to
them
and
their
social
position
as
well
as
their
limited
number
obliges
them
to
adopt
these
opinions
most
of
the
catholics
are
poor
and
they
have
no
chance
of
taking
a
part
in
the
government
unless
it
be
open
to
all
the
citizens
they
constitute
a
minority
and
all
rights
must
be
respected
in
order
to
ensure
to
them
the
free
exercise
of
their
own
privileges
these
two
causes
induce
them
unconsciously
to
adopt
political
doctrines
which
they
would
perhaps
support
with
less
zeal
if
they
were
rich
and
preponderant
the
catholic
clergy
of
the
united
states
has
never
attempted
to
oppose
this
political
tendency
but
it
seeks
rather
to
justify
its
results
the
priests
in
america
have
divided
the
intellectual
world
into
two
parts
in
the
one
they
place
the
doctrines
of
revealed
religion
which
command
their
assent
in
the
other
they
leave
those
truths
which
they
believe
to
have
been
freely
left
open
to
the
researches
of
political
inquiry
thus
the
catholics
of
the
united
states
are
at
the
same
time
the
most
faithful
believers
and
the
most
zealous
citizens
it
may
be
asserted
that
in
the
united
states
no
religious
doctrine
displays
the
slightest
hostility
to
democratic
and
republican
institutions
the
clergy
of
all
the
different
sects
holds
the
same
language
their
opinions
are
consonant
to
the
laws
and
the
human
intellect
flows
onward
in
one
sole
current
i
happened
to
be
staying
in
one
of
the
largest
towns
in
the
union
when
i
was
invited
to
attend
a
public
meeting
which
had
been
called
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
the
poles
and
of
sending
them
supplies
of
arms
and
money
i
found
two
or
three
thousand
persons
collected
in
a
vast
hall
which
had
been
prepared
to
receive
them
in
a
short
time
a
priest
in
his
ecclesiastical
robes
advanced
to
the
front
of
the
hustings
the
spectators
rose
and
stood
uncovered
while
he
spoke
in
the
following
terms
almighty
god
the
god
of
armies
thou
who
didst
strengthen
the
hearts
and
guide
the
arms
of
our
fathers
when
they
were
fighting
for
the
sacred
rights
of
national
independence
thou
who
didst
make
them
triumph
over
a
hateful
oppression
and
hast
granted
to
our
people
the
benefits
of
liberty
and
peace
turn
o
lord
a
favorable
eye
upon
the
other
hemisphere
pitifully
look
down
upon
that
heroic
nation
which
is
even
now
struggling
as
we
did
in
the
former
time
and
for
the
same
rights
which
we
defended
with
our
blood
thou
who
didst
create
man
in
the
likeness
of
the
same
image
let
no
tyranny
mar
thy
work
and
establish
inequality
upon
the
earth
almighty
god
do
thou
watch
over
the
destiny
of
the
poles
and
render
them
worthy
to
be
free
may
thy
wisdom
direct
their
councils
and
may
thy
strength
sustain
their
arms
shed
forth
thy
terror
over
their
enemies
scatter
the
powers
which
take
counsel
against
them
and
vouchsafe
that
the
injustice
which
the
world
has
beheld
for
fifty
years
be
not
consummated
in
our
time
o
lord
who
holdest
alike
the
hearts
of
nations
and
of
men
in
thy
powerful
hand
raise
up
allies
to
the
sacred
cause
of
right
arouse
the
french
nation
from
the
apathy
in
which
its
rulers
retain
it
that
it
go
forth
again
to
fight
for
the
liberties
of
the
world
lord
turn
not
thou
thy
face
from
us
and
grant
that
we
may
always
be
the
most
religious
as
well
as
the
freest
people
of
the
earth
almighty
god
hear
our
supplications
this
day
save
the
poles
we
beseech
thee
in
the
name
of
thy
well
beloved
son
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
died
upon
the
cross
for
the
salvation
of
men
amen
the
whole
meeting
responded
amen
with
devotion
indirect
influence
of
religious
opinions
upon
political
society
in
the
united
states
christian
morality
common
to
all
influence
of
religion
upon
the
manners
of
the
respect
for
the
marriage
in
what
manner
religion
confines
the
imagination
of
the
americans
within
certain
limits
and
checks
the
passion
of
opinion
of
the
americans
on
the
political
utility
of
their
exertions
to
extend
and
secure
its
predominance
i
have
just
shown
what
the
direct
influence
of
religion
upon
politics
is
in
the
united
states
but
its
indirect
influence
appears
to
me
to
be
still
more
considerable
and
it
never
instructs
the
americans
more
fully
in
the
art
of
being
free
than
when
it
says
nothing
of
freedom
the
sects
which
exist
in
the
united
states
are
innumerable
they
all
differ
in
respect
to
the
worship
which
is
due
from
man
to
his
creator
but
they
all
agree
in
respect
to
the
duties
which
are
due
from
man
to
man
each
sect
adores
the
deity
in
its
own
peculiar
manner
but
all
the
sects
preach
the
same
moral
law
in
the
name
of
god
if
it
be
of
the
slightest
importance
to
man
as
an
individual
that
his
religion
should
be
true
the
case
of
society
is
not
the
same
society
has
no
future
life
to
hope
for
or
to
fear
and
provided
the
citizens
profess
a
religion
the
peculiar
tenets
of
that
religion
are
of
very
little
importance
to
its
interests
moreover
almost
all
the
sects
of
the
united
states
are
comprised
within
the
great
unity
of
christianity
and
christian
morality
is
everywhere
the
same
it
may
be
believed
without
unfairness
that
a
certain
number
of
americans
pursue
a
peculiar
form
of
worship
from
habit
more
than
from
conviction
in
the
united
states
the
sovereign
authority
is
religious
and
consequently
hypocrisy
must
be
common
but
there
is
no
country
in
the
whole
world
in
which
the
christian
religion
retains
a
greater
influence
over
the
souls
of
men
than
in
america
and
there
can
be
no
greater
proof
of
its
utility
and
of
its
conformity
to
human
nature
than
that
its
influence
is
most
powerfully
felt
over
the
most
enlightened
and
free
nation
of
the
earth
i
have
remarked
that
the
members
of
the
american
clergy
in
general
without
even
excepting
those
who
do
not
admit
religious
liberty
are
all
in
favor
of
civil
freedom
but
they
do
not
support
any
particular
political
system
they
keep
aloof
from
parties
and
from
public
affairs
in
the
united
states
religion
exercises
but
little
influence
upon
the
laws
and
upon
the
details
of
public
opinion
but
it
directs
the
manners
of
the
community
and
by
regulating
domestic
life
it
regulates
the
state
i
do
not
question
that
the
great
austerity
of
manners
which
is
observable
in
the
united
states
arises
in
the
first
instance
from
religious
faith
religion
is
often
unable
to
restrain
man
from
the
numberless
temptations
of
fortune
nor
can
it
check
that
passion
for
gain
which
every
incident
of
his
life
contributes
to
arouse
but
its
influence
over
the
mind
of
women
is
supreme
and
women
are
the
protectors
of
morals
there
is
certainly
no
country
in
the
world
where
the
tie
of
marriage
is
so
much
respected
as
in
america
or
where
conjugal
happiness
is
more
highly
or
worthily
appreciated
in
europe
almost
all
the
disturbances
of
society
arise
from
the
irregularities
of
domestic
life
to
despise
the
natural
bonds
and
legitimate
pleasures
of
home
is
to
contract
a
taste
for
excesses
a
restlessness
of
heart
and
the
evil
of
fluctuating
desires
agitated
by
the
tumultuous
passions
which
frequently
disturb
his
dwelling
the
european
is
galled
by
the
obedience
which
the
legislative
powers
of
the
state
exact
but
when
the
american
retires
from
the
turmoil
of
public
life
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
he
finds
in
it
the
image
of
order
and
of
peace
there
his
pleasures
are
simple
and
natural
his
joys
are
innocent
and
calm
and
as
he
finds
that
an
orderly
life
is
the
surest
path
to
happiness
he
accustoms
himself
without
difficulty
to
moderate
his
opinions
as
well
as
his
tastes
while
the
european
endeavors
to
forget
his
domestic
troubles
by
agitating
society
the
american
derives
from
his
own
home
that
love
of
order
which
he
afterward
carries
with
him
into
public
affairs
in
the
united
states
the
influence
of
religion
is
not
confined
to
the
manners
but
it
extends
to
the
intelligence
of
the
people
among
the
there
are
some
who
profess
the
doctrines
of
christianity
from
a
sincere
belief
in
them
and
others
who
do
the
same
because
they
are
afraid
to
be
suspected
of
unbelief
christianity
therefore
reigns
without
any
obstacle
by
universal
consent
the
consequence
is
as
i
have
before
observed
that
every
principle
of
the
moral
world
is
fixed
and
determinate
although
the
political
world
is
abandoned
to
the
debates
and
the
experiments
of
men
thus
the
human
mind
is
never
left
to
wander
across
a
boundless
field
and
whatever
may
be
its
pretensions
it
is
checked
from
time
to
time
by
barriers
which
it
can
not
surmount
before
it
can
perpetrate
innovation
certain
primal
and
immutable
principles
are
laid
down
and
the
boldest
conceptions
of
human
device
are
subjected
to
certain
forms
which
retard
and
stop
their
completion
the
imagination
of
the
americans
even
in
its
greatest
flights
is
circumspect
and
undecided
its
impulses
are
checked
and
its
works
unfinished
these
habits
of
restraint
recur
in
political
society
and
are
singularly
favorable
both
to
the
tranquillity
of
the
people
and
the
durability
of
the
institutions
it
has
established
nature
and
circumstances
concurred
to
make
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
bold
men
as
is
sufficiently
attested
by
the
enterprising
spirit
with
which
they
seek
for
fortune
if
the
minds
of
the
americans
were
free
from
all
trammels
they
would
very
shortly
become
the
most
daring
innovators
and
the
most
implacable
disputants
in
the
world
but
the
revolutionists
of
america
are
obliged
to
profess
an
ostensible
respect
for
christian
morality
and
equity
which
does
not
easily
permit
them
to
violate
the
laws
that
oppose
their
designs
nor
would
they
find
it
easy
to
surmount
the
scruples
of
their
partisans
even
if
they
were
able
to
get
over
their
own
hitherto
no
one
in
the
united
states
has
dared
to
advance
the
maxim
that
everything
is
permissible
with
a
view
to
the
interests
of
society
an
impious
adage
which
seems
to
have
been
invented
in
an
age
of
freedom
to
shelter
all
the
tyrants
of
future
ages
thus
while
the
law
permits
the
americans
to
do
what
they
please
religion
prevents
them
from
conceiving
and
forbids
them
to
commit
what
is
rash
and
unjust
religion
in
america
takes
no
direct
part
in
the
government
of
society
but
it
must
nevertheless
be
regarded
as
the
foremost
of
the
political
institutions
of
that
country
for
if
it
does
not
impart
a
taste
for
freedom
it
facilitates
the
use
of
free
institutions
indeed
it
is
in
this
same
point
of
view
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
themselves
look
upon
religious
belief
i
do
not
know
whether
all
the
americans
have
a
sincere
faith
in
their
religion
for
who
can
search
the
human
heart
but
i
am
certain
that
they
hold
it
to
be
indispensable
to
the
maintenance
of
republican
institutions
this
opinion
is
not
peculiar
to
a
class
of
citizens
or
to
a
party
but
it
belongs
to
the
whole
nation
and
to
every
rank
of
society
in
the
united
states
if
a
political
character
attacks
a
sect
this
may
not
prevent
even
the
partisans
of
that
very
sect
from
supporting
him
but
if
he
attacks
all
the
sects
together
every
one
abandons
him
and
he
remains
alone
while
i
was
in
america
a
witness
who
happened
to
be
called
at
the
assizes
of
the
county
of
chester
state
of
new
york
declared
that
he
did
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
god
or
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
judge
refused
to
admit
his
evidence
on
the
ground
that
the
witness
had
destroyed
beforehand
all
the
confidence
of
the
court
in
what
he
was
about
to
say
the
newspapers
related
the
fact
without
any
farther
comment
the
americans
combine
the
notions
of
christianity
and
of
liberty
so
intimately
in
their
minds
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
them
conceive
the
one
without
the
other
and
with
them
this
conviction
does
not
spring
from
that
barren
traditionary
faith
which
seems
to
vegetate
in
the
soul
rather
than
to
live
i
have
known
of
societies
formed
by
the
americans
to
send
out
ministers
of
the
gospel
into
the
new
western
states
to
found
schools
and
churches
there
lest
religion
should
be
suffered
to
die
away
in
those
remote
settlements
and
the
rising
states
be
less
fitted
to
enjoy
free
institutions
than
the
people
from
which
they
emanated
i
met
with
wealthy
new
englanders
who
abandoned
the
country
in
which
they
were
born
in
order
to
lay
the
foundations
of
christianity
and
of
freedom
on
the
banks
of
the
missouri
or
in
the
prairies
of
illinois
thus
religious
zeal
is
perpetually
stimulated
in
the
united
states
by
the
duties
of
patriotism
these
men
do
not
act
from
an
exclusive
consideration
of
the
promises
of
a
future
life
eternity
is
only
one
motive
of
their
devotion
to
the
cause
and
if
you
converse
with
these
missionaries
of
christian
civilisation
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
much
value
they
set
upon
the
goods
of
this
world
and
that
you
meet
with
a
politician
where
you
expected
to
find
a
priest
they
will
tell
you
that
all
the
american
republics
are
collectively
involved
with
each
other
if
the
republics
of
the
west
were
to
fall
into
anarchy
or
to
be
mastered
by
a
despot
the
republican
institutions
which
now
flourish
upon
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
ocean
would
be
in
great
peril
it
is
therefore
our
interest
that
the
new
states
should
be
religious
in
order
to
maintain
our
liberties
such
are
the
opinions
of
the
americans
and
if
any
hold
that
the
religious
spirit
which
i
admire
is
the
very
thing
most
amiss
in
america
and
that
the
only
element
wanting
to
the
freedom
and
happiness
of
the
human
race
is
to
believe
in
some
blind
cosmogony
or
to
assert
with
cabanis
the
secretion
of
thought
by
the
brain
i
can
only
reply
that
those
who
hold
this
language
have
never
been
in
america
and
that
they
have
never
seen
a
religious
or
a
free
nation
when
they
return
from
their
expedition
we
shall
hear
what
they
have
to
say
there
are
persons
in
france
who
look
upon
republican
institutions
as
a
temporary
means
of
power
of
wealth
and
distinction
men
who
are
the
of
liberty
and
who
fight
for
their
own
advantage
whatever
be
the
colors
they
wear
it
is
not
to
these
that
i
address
myself
but
there
are
others
who
look
forward
to
the
republican
form
of
government
as
a
tranquil
and
lasting
state
toward
which
modern
society
is
daily
impelled
by
the
ideas
and
manners
of
the
time
and
who
sincerely
desire
to
prepare
men
to
be
free
when
these
men
attack
religious
opinions
they
obey
the
dictates
of
their
passions
to
the
prejudice
of
their
interests
despotism
may
govern
without
faith
but
liberty
can
not
religion
is
much
more
necessary
in
the
republic
which
they
set
forth
in
glowing
colors
than
in
the
monarchy
which
they
attack
and
it
is
more
needed
in
democratic
republics
than
in
any
others
how
is
it
possible
that
society
should
escape
destruction
if
the
moral
tie
be
not
strengthened
in
proportion
as
the
political
tie
is
relaxed
and
what
can
be
done
with
a
people
which
is
its
own
master
if
it
be
not
submissive
to
the
divinity
principal
causes
which
render
religion
powerful
in
america
care
taken
by
the
americans
to
separate
the
church
from
the
the
laws
public
opinion
and
even
the
exertions
of
the
clergy
concur
to
promote
this
influence
of
religion
upon
the
mind
in
the
united
states
attributable
to
this
reason
of
what
is
the
natural
state
of
men
with
regard
to
religion
at
the
present
what
are
the
peculiar
and
incidental
causes
which
prevent
men
in
certain
countries
from
arriving
at
this
state
the
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
explained
the
gradual
decay
of
religious
faith
in
a
very
simple
manner
religious
zeal
said
they
must
necessarily
fail
the
more
generally
liberty
is
established
and
knowledge
diffused
unfortunately
facts
are
by
no
means
in
accordance
with
their
theory
there
are
certain
populations
in
europe
whose
unbelief
is
only
equalled
by
their
ignorance
and
their
debasement
while
in
america
one
of
the
freest
and
most
enlightened
nations
in
the
world
fulfils
all
the
outward
duties
of
religion
with
fervor
upon
my
arrival
in
the
united
states
the
religious
aspect
of
the
country
was
the
first
thing
that
struck
my
attention
and
the
longer
i
stayed
there
the
more
did
i
perceive
the
great
political
consequences
resulting
from
this
state
of
things
to
which
i
was
unaccustomed
in
france
i
had
almost
always
seen
the
spirit
of
religion
and
the
spirit
of
freedom
pursuing
courses
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other
but
in
america
i
found
that
they
were
intimately
united
and
that
they
reigned
in
common
over
the
same
country
my
desire
to
discover
the
causes
of
this
phenomenon
increased
from
day
to
day
in
order
to
satisfy
it
i
questioned
the
members
of
all
the
different
sects
and
i
more
especially
sought
the
society
of
the
clergy
who
are
the
depositaries
of
the
different
persuasions
and
who
are
more
especially
interested
in
their
duration
as
a
member
of
the
roman
catholic
church
i
was
more
particularly
brought
into
contact
with
several
of
its
priests
with
whom
i
became
intimately
acquainted
to
each
of
these
men
i
expressed
my
astonishment
and
i
explained
my
doubts
i
found
that
they
differed
upon
matters
of
detail
alone
and
that
they
mainly
attributed
the
peaceable
dominion
of
religion
in
their
country
to
the
separation
of
church
and
state
i
do
not
hesitate
to
affirm
that
during
my
stay
in
america
i
did
not
meet
with
a
single
individual
of
the
clergy
or
of
the
laity
who
was
not
of
the
same
opinion
upon
this
point
this
led
me
to
examine
more
attentively
than
i
had
hitherto
done
the
station
which
the
american
clergy
occupy
in
political
society
i
learned
with
surprise
that
they
fill
no
public
appointments
not
one
of
them
is
to
be
met
with
in
the
administration
and
they
are
not
even
represented
in
the
legislative
assemblies
in
several
states
the
law
excludes
them
from
political
life
public
opinion
in
all
and
when
i
came
to
inquire
into
the
prevailing
spirit
of
the
clergy
i
found
that
most
of
its
members
seemed
to
retire
of
their
own
accord
from
the
exercise
of
power
and
that
they
made
it
the
pride
of
their
profession
to
abstain
from
politics
i
heard
them
inveigh
against
ambition
and
deceit
under
whatever
political
opinions
these
vices
might
chance
to
lurk
but
i
learned
from
their
discourses
that
men
are
not
guilty
in
the
eye
of
god
for
any
opinions
concerning
political
government
which
they
may
profess
with
sincerity
any
more
than
they
are
for
their
mistakes
in
building
a
house
or
in
driving
a
furrow
i
perceived
that
these
ministers
of
the
gospel
eschewed
all
parties
with
the
anxiety
attendant
upon
personal
interest
these
facts
convinced
me
that
what
i
had
been
told
was
true
and
it
then
became
my
object
to
investigate
their
causes
and
to
inquire
how
it
happened
that
the
real
authority
of
religion
was
increased
by
a
state
of
things
which
diminished
its
apparent
force
these
causes
did
not
long
escape
my
researches
the
short
space
of
threescore
years
can
never
content
the
imagination
of
man
nor
can
the
imperfect
joys
of
this
world
satisfy
his
heart
man
alone
of
all
created
beings
displays
a
natural
contempt
of
existence
and
yet
a
boundless
desire
to
exist
he
scorns
life
but
he
dreads
annihilation
these
different
feelings
incessantly
urge
his
soul
to
the
contemplation
of
a
future
state
and
religion
directs
his
musings
thither
religion
then
is
simply
another
form
of
hope
and
it
is
no
less
natural
to
the
human
heart
than
hope
itself
men
can
not
abandon
their
religious
faith
without
a
kind
of
aberration
of
intellect
and
a
sort
of
violent
distortion
of
their
true
natures
but
they
are
invincibly
brought
back
to
more
pious
sentiments
for
unbelief
is
an
accident
and
faith
is
the
only
permanent
state
of
mankind
if
we
only
consider
religious
institutions
in
a
purely
human
point
of
view
they
may
be
said
to
derive
an
inexhaustible
element
of
strength
from
man
himself
since
they
belong
to
one
of
the
constituent
principles
of
human
nature
i
am
aware
that
at
certain
times
religion
may
strengthen
this
influence
which
originates
in
itself
by
the
artificial
power
of
the
laws
and
by
the
support
of
those
temporal
institutions
which
direct
society
religions
intimately
united
to
the
governments
of
the
earth
have
been
known
to
exercise
a
sovereign
authority
derived
from
the
twofold
source
of
terror
and
of
faith
but
when
a
religion
contracts
an
alliance
of
this
nature
i
do
not
hesitate
to
affirm
that
it
commits
the
same
error
as
a
man
who
should
sacrifice
his
future
to
his
present
welfare
and
in
obtaining
a
power
to
which
it
has
no
claim
it
risks
that
authority
which
is
rightfully
its
own
when
a
religion
founds
its
empire
upon
the
desire
of
immortality
which
lives
in
every
human
heart
it
may
aspire
to
universal
dominion
but
when
it
connects
itself
with
a
government
it
must
necessarily
adopt
maxims
which
are
only
applicable
to
certain
nations
thus
in
forming
an
alliance
with
a
political
power
religion
augments
its
authority
over
a
few
and
forfeits
the
hope
of
reigning
over
all
as
long
as
a
religion
rests
upon
those
sentiments
which
are
the
consolation
of
all
affliction
it
may
attract
the
affections
of
mankind
but
if
it
be
mixed
up
with
the
bitter
passions
of
the
world
it
may
be
constrained
to
defend
allies
whom
its
interests
and
not
the
principle
of
love
have
given
to
it
or
to
repel
as
antagonists
men
who
are
still
attached
to
its
own
spirit
however
opposed
they
may
be
to
the
powers
to
which
it
is
allied
the
church
can
not
share
the
temporal
power
of
the
state
without
being
the
object
of
a
portion
of
that
animosity
which
the
latter
excites
the
political
powers
which
seem
to
be
most
firmly
established
have
frequently
no
better
guarantee
for
their
duration
than
the
opinions
of
a
generation
the
interests
of
the
time
or
the
life
of
an
individual
a
law
may
modify
the
social
condition
which
seems
to
be
most
fixed
and
determinate
and
with
the
social
condition
everything
else
must
change
the
powers
of
society
are
more
or
less
fugitive
like
the
years
which
we
spend
upon
the
earth
they
succeed
each
other
with
rapidity
like
the
fleeting
cares
of
life
and
no
government
has
ever
yet
been
founded
upon
an
invariable
disposition
of
the
human
heart
or
upon
an
imperishable
interest
as
long
as
religion
is
sustained
by
those
feelings
propensities
and
passions
which
are
found
to
occur
under
the
same
forms
at
all
the
different
periods
of
history
it
may
defy
the
efforts
of
time
or
at
least
it
can
only
be
destroyed
by
another
religion
but
when
religion
clings
to
the
interests
of
the
world
it
becomes
almost
as
fragile
a
thing
as
the
powers
of
the
earth
it
is
the
only
one
of
them
all
which
can
hope
for
immortality
but
if
it
be
connected
with
their
ephemeral
authority
it
shares
their
fortunes
and
may
fall
with
those
transient
passions
which
supported
them
for
a
day
the
alliance
which
religion
contracts
with
political
powers
must
needs
be
onerous
to
itself
since
it
does
not
require
their
assistance
to
live
and
by
giving
them
its
assistance
it
may
be
exposed
to
decay
the
danger
which
i
have
just
pointed
out
always
exists
but
it
is
not
always
equally
visible
in
some
ages
governments
seem
to
be
imperishable
in
others
the
existence
of
society
appears
to
be
more
precarious
than
the
life
of
man
some
constitutions
plunge
the
citizens
into
a
lethargic
somnolence
and
others
rouse
them
to
feverish
excitement
when
government
appears
to
be
so
strong
and
laws
so
stable
men
do
not
perceive
the
dangers
which
may
accrue
from
a
union
of
church
and
state
when
governments
display
so
much
inconstancy
the
danger
is
but
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
avoid
it
to
be
effectual
measures
must
be
taken
to
discover
its
approach
in
proportion
as
a
nation
assumes
a
democratic
condition
of
society
and
as
communities
display
democratic
propensities
it
becomes
more
and
more
dangerous
to
connect
religion
with
political
institutions
for
the
time
is
coming
when
authority
will
be
bandied
from
hand
to
hand
when
political
theories
will
succeed
each
other
and
when
men
laws
and
constitutions
will
disappear
or
be
modified
from
day
to
day
and
this
not
for
a
season
only
but
unceasingly
agitation
and
mutability
are
inherent
in
the
nature
of
democratic
republics
just
as
stagnation
and
inertness
are
the
law
of
absolute
monarchies
if
the
americans
who
change
the
head
of
the
government
once
in
four
years
who
elect
new
legislators
every
two
years
and
renew
the
provincial
officers
every
twelvemonth
if
the
americans
who
have
abandoned
the
political
world
to
the
attempts
of
innovators
had
not
placed
religion
beyond
their
reach
where
could
it
abide
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
human
opinions
where
would
that
respect
which
belongs
to
it
be
paid
amid
the
struggles
of
faction
and
what
would
become
of
its
immortality
in
the
midst
of
perpetual
decay
the
american
clergy
were
the
first
to
perceive
this
truth
and
to
act
in
conformity
with
it
they
saw
that
they
must
renounce
their
religious
influence
if
they
were
to
strive
for
political
power
and
they
chose
to
give
up
the
support
of
the
state
rather
than
to
share
in
its
vicissitudes
in
america
religion
is
perhaps
less
powerful
than
it
has
been
at
certain
periods
in
the
history
of
certain
peoples
but
its
influence
is
more
lasting
it
restricts
itself
to
its
own
resources
but
of
those
none
can
deprive
it
its
circle
is
limited
to
certain
principles
but
those
principles
are
entirely
its
own
and
under
its
undisputed
control
on
every
side
in
europe
we
hear
voices
complaining
of
the
absence
of
religious
faith
and
inquiring
the
means
of
restoring
to
religion
some
remnant
of
its
pristine
authority
it
seems
to
me
that
we
must
first
attentively
consider
what
ought
to
be
natural
of
men
with
regard
to
religion
at
the
present
time
and
when
we
know
what
we
have
to
hope
and
to
fear
we
may
discern
the
end
to
which
our
efforts
ought
to
be
directed
the
two
great
dangers
which
threaten
the
existence
of
religions
are
schism
and
indifference
in
ages
of
fervent
devotion
men
sometimes
abandon
their
religion
but
they
only
shake
it
off
in
order
to
adopt
another
their
faith
changes
the
objects
to
which
it
is
directed
but
it
suffers
no
decline
the
old
religion
then
excites
enthusiastic
attachment
or
bitter
enmity
in
either
party
some
leave
it
with
anger
others
cling
to
it
with
increased
devotedness
and
although
persuasions
differ
irreligion
is
unknown
such
however
is
not
the
case
when
a
religious
belief
is
secretly
undermined
by
doctrines
which
may
be
termed
negative
since
they
deny
the
truth
of
one
religion
without
affirming
that
of
any
other
prodigious
revolutions
then
take
place
in
the
human
mind
without
the
apparent
of
the
passions
of
man
and
almost
without
his
knowledge
men
lose
the
object
of
their
fondest
hopes
as
if
through
forgetfulness
they
are
carried
away
by
an
imperceptible
current
which
they
have
not
the
courage
to
stem
but
which
they
follow
with
regret
since
it
bears
them
from
a
faith
they
love
to
a
scepticism
that
plunges
them
into
despair
in
ages
which
answer
to
this
description
men
desert
their
religious
opinions
from
lukewarmness
rather
than
from
dislike
they
do
not
reject
them
but
the
sentiments
by
which
they
were
once
fostered
disappear
but
if
the
unbeliever
does
not
admit
religion
to
be
true
he
still
considers
it
useful
regarding
religious
institutions
in
a
human
point
of
view
he
acknowledges
their
influence
upon
manners
and
legislation
he
admits
that
they
may
serve
to
make
men
live
in
peace
with
one
another
and
to
prepare
them
gently
for
the
hour
of
death
he
regrets
the
faith
which
he
has
lost
and
as
he
is
deprived
of
a
treasure
which
he
has
learned
to
estimate
at
its
full
value
he
scruples
to
take
it
from
those
who
still
possess
it
on
the
other
hand
those
who
continue
to
believe
are
not
afraid
openly
to
avow
their
faith
they
look
upon
those
who
do
not
share
their
persuasion
as
more
worthy
of
pity
than
of
opposition
and
they
are
aware
that
to
acquire
the
esteem
of
the
unbelieving
they
are
not
obliged
to
follow
their
example
they
are
hostile
to
no
one
in
the
world
and
as
they
do
not
consider
the
society
in
which
they
live
as
an
arena
in
which
religion
is
bound
to
face
its
thousand
deadly
foes
they
love
their
contemporaries
while
they
condemn
their
weaknesses
and
lament
their
errors
as
those
who
do
not
believe
conceal
their
incredulity
and
as
those
who
believe
display
their
faith
public
opinion
pronounces
itself
in
favor
of
religion
love
support
and
honor
are
bestowed
upon
it
and
it
is
only
by
searching
the
human
soul
that
we
can
detect
the
wounds
which
it
has
received
the
mass
of
mankind
who
are
never
without
the
feeling
of
religion
do
not
perceive
anything
at
variance
with
the
established
faith
the
instinctive
desire
of
a
future
life
brings
the
crowd
about
the
altar
and
opens
the
hearts
of
men
to
the
precepts
and
consolations
of
religion
but
this
picture
is
not
applicable
to
us
for
there
are
men
among
us
who
have
ceased
to
believe
in
christianity
without
adopting
any
other
religion
others
who
are
in
the
perplexities
of
doubt
and
who
already
affect
not
to
believe
and
others
again
who
are
afraid
to
avow
that
christian
faith
which
they
still
cherish
in
secret
amid
these
lukewarm
partisans
and
ardent
antagonists
a
small
number
of
believers
exist
who
are
ready
to
brave
all
obstacles
and
to
scorn
all
dangers
in
defence
of
their
faith
they
have
done
violence
to
human
weakness
in
order
to
rise
superior
to
public
opinion
excited
by
the
effort
they
have
made
they
scarcely
know
where
to
stop
and
as
they
know
that
the
first
use
which
the
french
made
of
independence
was
to
attack
religion
they
look
upon
their
contemporaries
with
dread
and
they
recoil
in
alarm
from
the
liberty
which
their
are
seeking
to
obtain
as
unbelief
appears
to
them
to
be
a
novelty
they
comprise
all
that
is
new
in
one
indiscriminate
animosity
they
are
at
war
with
their
age
and
country
and
they
look
upon
every
opinion
which
is
put
forth
there
as
the
necessary
enemy
of
the
faith
such
is
not
the
natural
state
of
men
with
regard
to
religion
at
the
present
day
and
some
extraordinary
or
incidental
cause
must
be
at
work
in
france
to
prevent
the
human
mind
from
following
its
original
propensities
and
to
drive
it
beyond
the
limits
at
which
it
ought
naturally
to
stop
i
am
intimately
convinced
that
this
extraordinary
and
incidental
cause
is
the
close
connexion
of
politics
and
religion
the
unbelievers
of
europe
attack
the
christians
as
their
political
opponents
rather
than
as
their
religious
adversaries
they
hate
the
christian
religion
as
the
opinion
of
a
party
much
more
than
as
an
error
of
belief
and
they
reject
the
clergy
less
because
they
are
the
representatives
of
the
divinity
than
because
they
are
the
allies
of
authority
in
europe
christianity
has
been
intimately
united
to
the
powers
of
the
earth
those
powers
are
now
in
decay
and
it
is
as
it
were
buried
under
their
ruins
the
living
body
of
religion
has
been
bound
down
to
the
dead
corpse
of
superannuated
polity
cut
the
bonds
which
restrain
it
and
that
which
is
alive
will
rise
once
more
i
know
not
what
could
restore
the
christian
church
of
europe
to
the
energy
of
its
earlier
days
that
power
belongs
to
god
alone
but
it
may
be
the
effect
of
human
policy
to
leave
the
faith
in
all
the
full
exercise
of
the
strength
which
it
still
retains
how
the
instruction
the
habits
and
the
practical
experience
of
the
americans
promote
the
success
of
their
democratic
institutions
what
is
to
be
understood
by
the
instruction
of
the
american
the
human
mind
is
more
superficially
instructed
in
the
united
states
than
in
no
one
completely
reason
of
this
rapidity
with
which
opinions
are
diffused
even
in
the
uncultivated
states
of
the
practical
experience
more
serviceable
to
the
americans
than
i
have
but
little
to
add
to
what
i
have
already
said
concerning
the
influence
which
the
instruction
and
the
habits
of
the
americans
exercise
upon
the
maintenance
of
their
political
institutions
america
has
hitherto
produced
very
few
writers
of
distinction
it
possesses
no
great
historians
and
not
a
single
eminent
poet
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
look
upon
what
are
properly
styled
literary
pursuits
with
a
kind
of
disapprobation
and
there
are
towns
of
very
second
rate
importance
in
europe
in
which
more
literary
works
are
annually
published
than
in
the
states
of
the
union
put
together
the
spirit
of
the
americans
is
averse
to
general
ideas
and
it
does
not
seek
theoretical
discoveries
neither
politics
nor
manufactures
direct
them
to
these
occupations
and
although
new
laws
are
perpetually
enacted
in
the
united
states
no
great
writers
have
hitherto
inquired
into
the
principles
of
their
legislation
the
americans
have
lawyers
and
commentators
but
no
jurists
and
they
furnish
examples
rather
than
lessons
to
the
world
the
same
observation
applies
to
the
mechanical
arts
in
america
the
inventions
of
europe
are
adopted
with
sagacity
they
are
perfected
and
adapted
with
admirable
skill
to
the
wants
of
the
country
manufactures
exist
but
the
science
of
manufacture
is
not
cultivated
and
they
have
good
workmen
but
very
few
inventors
fulton
was
obliged
to
proffer
his
services
to
foreign
nations
for
a
long
time
before
he
was
able
to
devote
them
to
his
own
country
the
remark
that
in
america
there
are
very
good
workmen
but
very
few
inventors
will
excite
surprise
in
this
country
the
inventive
character
of
fulton
he
seems
to
admit
but
would
apparently
deprive
us
of
the
credit
of
his
name
by
the
remark
that
he
was
obliged
to
proffer
his
services
to
foreign
nations
for
a
long
time
he
might
have
added
that
those
proffers
were
disregarded
and
neglected
and
that
it
was
finally
in
his
own
country
that
he
found
the
aid
necessary
to
put
in
execution
his
great
project
if
there
be
patronage
extended
by
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
any
one
thing
in
preference
to
another
it
is
to
the
results
of
inventive
genius
surely
franklin
rittenhouse
and
perkins
have
been
heard
of
by
our
author
and
he
must
have
heard
something
of
that
wonderful
invention
the
of
whitney
and
of
the
machines
for
making
cards
to
comb
wool
the
original
machines
of
fulton
for
the
application
of
steam
have
been
constantly
improving
so
that
there
is
scarcely
a
vestige
of
them
remaining
but
to
sum
up
the
whole
in
one
word
can
it
be
possible
that
our
author
did
not
visit
the
patent
office
at
washington
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
of
of
the
inventions
of
which
the
descriptions
and
models
are
there
deposited
no
one
who
has
ever
seen
that
depository
or
who
has
read
a
description
of
its
contents
can
doubt
that
they
furnish
the
most
incontestible
evidence
of
extraordinary
inventive
genius
a
genius
that
has
excited
the
astonishment
of
other
european
the
observer
who
is
desirous
of
forming
an
opinion
on
the
state
of
instruction
among
the
must
consider
the
same
object
from
two
different
points
of
view
if
he
only
singles
out
the
learned
he
will
be
astonished
to
find
how
rare
they
are
but
if
he
counts
the
ignorant
the
american
people
will
appear
to
be
the
most
enlightened
community
in
the
world
the
whole
population
as
i
observed
in
another
place
is
situated
between
these
two
extremes
in
new
england
every
citizen
receives
the
elementary
notions
of
human
knowledge
he
is
moreover
taught
the
doctrines
and
the
evidences
of
his
religion
the
history
of
his
country
and
the
leading
features
of
its
constitution
in
the
states
of
connecticut
and
massachusetts
it
is
extremely
rare
to
find
a
man
imperfectly
acquainted
with
all
these
things
and
a
person
wholly
ignorant
of
them
is
a
sort
of
phenomenon
when
i
compare
the
greek
and
roman
republics
with
these
american
states
the
manuscript
libraries
of
the
former
and
their
rude
population
with
the
innumerable
journals
and
the
enlightened
people
of
the
latter
when
i
remember
all
the
attempts
which
are
made
to
judge
the
modern
republics
by
the
assistance
of
those
of
antiquity
and
to
infer
what
will
happen
in
our
time
from
what
took
place
two
thousand
years
ago
i
am
tempted
to
burn
my
books
in
order
to
apply
none
but
novel
ideas
to
so
novel
a
condition
of
society
what
i
have
said
of
new
england
must
not
however
be
applied
indiscriminately
to
the
whole
union
as
we
advance
towards
the
west
or
the
south
the
instruction
of
the
people
diminishes
in
the
states
which
are
adjacent
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
a
certain
number
of
individuals
may
be
found
as
in
our
own
countries
who
are
devoid
of
the
rudiments
of
instruction
but
there
is
not
a
single
district
in
the
united
states
sunk
in
complete
ignorance
and
for
a
very
simple
reason
the
peoples
of
europe
started
from
the
darkness
of
a
barbarous
condition
to
advance
toward
the
light
of
civilisation
their
progress
has
been
unequal
some
of
them
have
improved
apace
while
others
have
loitered
in
their
course
and
some
have
stopped
and
are
still
sleeping
upon
the
way
such
has
not
been
the
case
in
the
united
states
the
settled
in
a
state
of
civilisation
upon
that
territory
which
their
descendants
occupy
they
had
not
to
begin
to
learn
and
it
was
sufficient
not
to
forget
now
the
children
of
these
same
americans
are
the
persons
who
year
by
year
transport
their
dwellings
into
the
wilds
and
with
their
dwellings
their
acquired
information
and
their
esteem
for
knowledge
education
has
taught
them
the
utility
of
instruction
and
has
enabled
them
to
transmit
that
instruction
to
their
posterity
in
the
united
states
society
has
no
infancy
but
it
is
born
in
man
estate
the
americans
never
use
the
word
peasant
because
they
have
no
idea
of
the
peculiar
class
which
that
term
denotes
the
ignorance
of
more
remote
ages
the
simplicity
of
rural
life
and
the
rusticity
of
the
villager
have
not
been
preserved
among
them
and
they
are
alike
unacquainted
with
the
virtues
the
vices
the
coarse
habits
and
the
simple
graces
of
an
early
stage
of
civilisation
at
the
extreme
borders
of
the
confederate
states
upon
the
confines
of
society
and
of
the
wilderness
a
population
of
bold
adventurers
have
taken
up
their
abode
who
pierce
the
solitudes
of
the
american
woods
and
seek
a
country
there
in
order
to
escape
that
poverty
which
awaited
them
in
their
native
provinces
as
soon
as
the
pioneer
arrives
upon
the
spot
which
is
to
serve
him
for
a
retreat
he
fells
a
few
trees
and
builds
a
nothing
can
offer
a
more
miserable
aspect
than
these
isolated
dwellings
the
traveller
who
approaches
one
of
them
toward
sees
the
flicker
of
the
through
the
chinks
in
the
walls
and
at
night
if
the
wind
rises
he
hears
the
roof
of
boughs
shake
to
and
fro
in
the
midst
of
the
great
forest
trees
who
would
not
suppose
that
this
poor
hut
is
the
asylum
of
rudeness
and
ignorance
yet
no
sort
of
comparison
can
be
drawn
between
the
pioneer
and
the
dwelling
which
shelters
him
everything
about
him
is
primitive
and
unformed
but
he
is
himself
the
result
of
the
labor
and
the
experience
of
eighteen
centuries
he
wears
the
dress
and
he
speaks
the
language
of
cities
he
is
acquainted
with
the
past
curious
of
the
future
and
ready
for
argument
upon
the
present
he
is
in
short
a
highly
civilized
being
who
consents
for
a
time
to
inhabit
the
and
who
penetrates
into
the
wilds
of
a
new
world
with
the
bible
an
axe
and
a
file
of
newspapers
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
the
incredible
rapidity
with
which
public
opinion
circulates
in
the
midst
of
these
deserts
i
do
not
think
that
so
much
intellectual
intercourse
takes
place
in
the
most
enlightened
and
populous
districts
of
france
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
in
the
united
states
the
instruction
of
the
people
powerfully
contributes
to
the
support
of
a
democratic
republic
and
such
must
always
be
the
case
i
believe
where
instruction
which
awakens
the
understanding
is
not
separated
from
moral
education
which
amends
the
heart
but
i
by
no
means
exaggerate
this
benefit
and
i
am
still
farther
from
thinking
as
so
many
people
do
think
in
europe
that
men
can
be
instantaneously
made
citizens
by
teaching
them
to
read
and
write
true
information
is
mainly
derived
from
experience
and
if
the
americans
had
not
been
gradually
accustomed
to
govern
themselves
their
would
not
assist
them
much
at
the
present
day
i
have
lived
a
great
deal
with
the
people
in
the
united
states
and
i
can
not
express
how
much
i
admire
their
experience
and
their
good
sense
an
american
should
never
be
allowed
to
speak
of
europe
for
he
will
then
probably
display
a
vast
deal
of
presumption
and
very
foolish
pride
he
will
take
up
with
those
crude
and
vague
notions
which
are
so
useful
to
the
ignorant
all
over
the
world
but
if
you
question
him
respecting
his
own
country
the
cloud
which
dimmed
his
intelligence
will
immediately
disperse
his
language
will
become
as
clear
and
as
precise
as
his
thoughts
he
will
inform
you
what
his
rights
are
and
by
what
means
he
exercises
them
he
will
be
able
to
point
out
the
customs
which
obtain
in
the
political
world
you
will
find
that
he
is
well
acquainted
with
the
rules
of
the
administration
and
that
he
is
familiar
with
the
mechanism
of
the
laws
the
citizen
of
the
united
states
does
not
acquire
his
practical
science
and
his
positive
notions
from
books
the
instruction
he
has
acquired
may
have
prepared
him
for
receiving
those
ideas
but
it
did
not
furnish
them
the
american
learns
to
know
the
laws
by
participating
in
the
act
of
legislation
and
he
takes
a
lesson
in
the
forms
of
government
from
governing
the
great
work
of
society
is
ever
going
on
beneath
his
eyes
and
as
it
were
under
his
hands
in
the
united
states
politics
are
the
end
and
aim
of
education
in
europe
its
principal
object
is
to
fit
men
for
private
life
the
interference
of
the
citizens
in
public
affairs
is
too
rare
an
occurrence
for
it
to
be
anticipated
beforehand
upon
casting
a
glance
over
society
in
the
two
hemispheres
these
differences
are
indicated
even
by
its
external
aspect
in
europe
we
frequently
introduce
the
ideas
and
the
habits
of
private
life
into
public
affairs
and
as
we
pass
at
once
from
the
domestic
circle
to
the
government
of
the
state
we
may
frequently
be
heard
to
discuss
the
great
interests
of
society
in
the
same
manner
in
which
we
converse
with
our
friends
the
americans
on
the
other
hand
transfuse
the
habits
of
public
life
into
their
manners
in
private
and
in
their
country
the
jury
is
introduced
into
the
games
of
and
parliamentary
forms
are
observed
in
the
order
of
a
feast
the
laws
contribute
more
to
the
maintenance
of
the
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
than
the
physical
circumstances
of
the
country
and
the
manners
more
than
the
laws
all
the
nations
of
america
have
a
democratic
state
of
yet
democratic
institutions
subsist
only
among
the
the
spaniards
of
south
america
equally
favored
by
physical
causes
as
the
unable
to
maintain
a
democratic
mexico
which
has
adopted
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
the
same
the
of
the
west
less
able
to
maintain
it
than
those
of
the
reason
of
these
different
results
i
have
remarked
that
the
maintenance
of
democratic
institutions
in
the
united
states
is
attributable
to
the
circumstances
the
laws
and
the
manners
of
that
country
most
europeans
are
only
acquainted
with
the
first
of
these
three
causes
and
they
are
apt
to
give
it
a
preponderating
importance
which
it
does
not
really
possess
it
is
true
that
the
settled
in
the
new
world
in
a
state
of
social
equality
the
and
the
noble
were
not
to
be
found
among
them
and
professional
prejudices
were
always
as
entirely
unknown
as
the
prejudices
of
birth
thus
as
the
condition
of
society
was
democratic
the
empire
of
democracy
was
established
without
difficulty
but
this
circumstance
is
by
no
means
peculiar
to
the
united
states
almost
all
the
transatlantic
colonies
were
founded
by
men
equal
among
themselves
or
who
became
so
by
inhabiting
them
in
no
one
part
of
the
new
world
have
europeans
been
able
to
create
an
aristocracy
nevertheless
democratic
institutions
prosper
nowhere
but
in
the
united
states
the
american
union
has
no
enemies
to
contend
with
it
stands
in
the
wilds
like
an
island
in
the
ocean
but
the
spaniards
of
south
america
were
no
less
isolated
by
nature
yet
their
position
has
not
relieved
them
from
the
charge
of
standing
armies
they
make
war
upon
each
other
when
they
have
no
foreign
enemies
to
oppose
and
the
democracy
is
the
only
one
which
has
hitherto
been
able
to
maintain
itself
in
peace
the
territory
of
the
union
presents
a
boundless
field
to
human
activity
and
inexhaustible
materials
for
industry
and
labor
the
passion
of
wealth
takes
the
place
of
ambition
and
the
warmth
of
faction
is
mitigated
by
a
sense
of
prosperity
but
in
what
portion
of
the
globe
shall
we
meet
with
more
fertile
plains
with
mightier
rivers
or
with
more
unexplored
and
inexhaustible
riches
than
in
south
america
nevertheless
south
america
has
been
unable
to
maintain
democratic
institutions
if
the
welfare
of
nations
depended
on
their
being
placed
in
a
remote
position
with
an
unbounded
space
of
habitable
territory
before
them
the
spaniards
of
south
america
would
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
their
fate
and
although
they
might
enjoy
less
prosperity
than
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
their
lot
might
still
be
such
as
to
excite
the
envy
of
some
nations
in
europe
there
are
however
no
nations
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
more
miserable
than
those
of
south
america
thus
not
only
are
physical
causes
inadequate
to
produce
results
analogous
to
those
which
occur
in
north
america
but
they
are
unable
to
raise
the
population
of
south
america
above
the
level
of
european
states
where
they
act
in
a
contrary
direction
physical
causes
do
not
therefore
affect
the
destiny
of
nations
so
much
as
has
been
supposed
i
have
met
with
men
in
new
england
who
were
on
the
point
of
leaving
a
country
where
they
might
have
remained
in
easy
circumstances
to
go
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
the
wilds
not
far
from
that
district
i
found
a
french
population
in
canada
which
was
closely
crowded
on
a
narrow
territory
although
the
same
wilds
were
at
hand
and
while
the
emigrant
from
the
united
states
purchased
an
extensive
estate
with
the
earnings
of
a
short
term
of
labor
the
canadian
paid
as
much
for
land
as
he
would
have
done
in
france
nature
offers
the
solitudes
of
the
new
world
to
europeans
but
they
are
not
always
acquainted
with
the
means
of
turning
her
gifts
to
account
other
peoples
of
america
have
the
same
physical
conditions
of
prosperity
as
the
but
without
their
laws
and
their
manners
and
these
peoples
are
wretched
the
laws
and
manners
of
the
are
therefore
that
cause
of
their
greatness
which
is
the
object
of
my
inquiry
i
am
far
from
supposing
that
the
american
laws
are
preeminently
good
in
themselves
i
do
not
hold
them
to
be
applicable
to
all
democratic
peoples
and
several
of
them
seem
to
me
to
be
dangerous
even
in
the
united
states
nevertheless
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
american
legislation
taken
collectively
is
extremely
well
adapted
to
the
genius
of
the
people
and
the
nature
of
the
country
which
it
is
intended
to
govern
the
american
laws
are
therefore
good
and
to
them
must
be
attributed
a
large
portion
of
the
success
which
attends
the
government
of
democracy
in
america
but
i
do
not
believe
them
to
be
the
principal
cause
of
that
success
and
if
they
seem
to
me
to
have
more
influence
upon
the
social
happiness
of
the
americans
than
the
nature
of
the
country
on
the
other
hand
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
their
effect
is
still
inferior
to
that
produced
by
the
manners
of
the
people
the
federal
laws
undoubtedly
constitute
the
most
important
part
of
the
legislation
of
the
united
states
mexico
which
is
not
less
fortunately
situated
than
the
union
has
adopted
these
same
laws
but
is
unable
to
accustom
itself
to
the
government
of
democracy
some
other
cause
is
therefore
at
work
independently
of
those
physical
circumstances
and
peculiar
laws
which
enable
the
democracy
to
rule
in
the
united
states
another
still
more
striking
proof
may
be
adduced
almost
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
territory
of
the
union
are
the
descendants
of
a
common
stock
they
speak
the
same
language
they
worship
god
in
the
same
manner
they
are
affected
by
the
same
physical
causes
and
they
obey
the
same
laws
whence
then
do
their
characteristic
differences
arise
why
in
the
eastern
states
of
the
union
does
the
republican
government
display
vigor
and
regularity
and
proceed
with
mature
deliberation
whence
does
it
derive
the
wisdom
and
durability
which
mark
its
acts
while
in
the
western
states
on
the
contrary
society
seems
to
be
ruled
by
the
powers
of
chance
there
public
business
is
conducted
with
an
irregularity
and
a
passionate
and
feverish
excitement
which
does
not
announce
a
long
or
sure
duration
i
am
no
longer
comparing
the
states
to
foreign
nations
but
i
am
contrasting
them
with
each
other
and
endeavoring
to
discover
why
they
are
so
unlike
the
arguments
which
are
derived
from
the
nature
of
the
country
and
the
difference
of
legislation
are
here
all
set
aside
recourse
must
be
had
to
some
other
cause
and
what
other
cause
can
there
be
except
the
manners
of
the
people
it
is
in
the
eastern
states
that
the
have
been
longest
accustomed
to
the
government
of
democracy
and
that
they
have
adopted
the
habits
and
conceived
the
notions
most
favorable
to
its
maintenance
democracy
has
gradually
penetrated
into
their
customs
their
opinions
and
the
forms
of
social
intercourse
it
is
to
be
found
in
all
the
details
of
daily
life
equally
as
in
the
laws
in
the
eastern
states
the
instruction
and
practical
education
of
the
people
have
been
most
perfected
and
religion
has
been
most
thoroughly
amalgamated
with
liberty
now
these
habits
opinions
customs
and
convictions
are
precisely
the
constituent
elements
of
that
which
i
have
denominated
manners
in
the
western
states
on
the
contrary
a
portion
of
the
same
advantages
is
still
wanting
many
of
the
americans
of
the
west
were
born
in
the
woods
and
they
mix
the
ideas
and
the
customs
of
savage
life
with
the
civilisation
of
their
parents
their
passions
are
more
intense
their
religious
morality
less
authoritative
and
their
convictions
are
less
secure
the
inhabitants
exercise
no
sort
of
control
over
their
for
they
are
scarcely
acquainted
with
each
other
the
nations
of
the
west
display
to
a
certain
extent
the
inexperience
and
the
rude
habits
of
a
people
in
its
infancy
for
although
they
are
composed
of
old
elements
their
assemblage
is
of
recent
date
the
manners
of
the
americans
of
the
united
states
are
then
the
real
cause
which
renders
that
people
the
only
one
of
the
american
nations
that
is
able
to
support
a
democratic
government
and
it
is
the
influence
of
manners
which
produces
the
different
degrees
of
order
and
of
prosperity
that
may
be
distinguished
in
the
several
democracies
thus
the
effect
which
the
geographical
position
of
a
country
may
have
upon
the
duration
of
democratic
institutions
is
exaggerated
in
europe
too
much
importance
is
attributed
to
legislation
too
little
to
manners
these
three
great
causes
serve
no
doubt
to
regulate
and
direct
the
american
democracy
but
if
they
were
to
be
classed
in
their
proper
order
i
should
say
that
the
physical
circumstances
are
less
efficient
than
the
laws
and
the
laws
very
subordinate
to
the
manners
of
the
people
i
am
convinced
that
the
most
advantageous
situation
and
the
best
possible
laws
can
not
maintain
a
constitution
in
spite
of
the
manners
of
a
country
while
the
latter
may
turn
the
most
unfavorable
positions
and
the
worst
laws
to
some
advantage
the
importance
of
manners
is
a
common
truth
to
which
study
and
experience
incessantly
direct
our
attention
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
central
point
in
the
range
of
human
observation
and
the
common
termination
of
all
inquiry
so
seriously
do
i
insist
upon
this
head
that
if
i
have
hitherto
failed
in
making
the
reader
feel
the
important
influence
which
i
attribute
to
the
practical
experience
the
habits
the
opinions
in
short
to
the
manners
of
the
americans
upon
the
maintenance
of
their
institutions
i
have
failed
in
the
principal
object
of
my
work
whether
laws
and
manners
are
sufficient
to
maintain
democratic
institutions
in
other
countries
beside
america
the
if
transported
into
europe
would
be
obliged
to
modify
their
distinction
to
be
made
between
democratic
institutions
and
american
democratic
laws
may
be
conceived
better
than
or
at
least
different
from
those
which
the
american
democracy
has
the
example
of
america
only
proves
that
it
is
possible
to
regulate
democracy
by
the
assistance
of
manners
and
legislation
i
have
asserted
that
the
success
of
democratic
institutions
in
the
united
states
is
more
intimately
connected
with
the
laws
themselves
and
the
manners
of
the
people
than
with
the
nature
of
the
country
but
does
it
follow
that
the
same
causes
would
of
themselves
produce
the
same
results
if
they
were
put
into
operation
elsewhere
and
if
the
country
is
no
adequate
substitute
for
laws
and
manners
can
laws
and
manners
in
their
turn
prove
a
substitute
for
a
country
it
will
readily
be
understood
that
the
necessary
elements
of
a
reply
to
this
question
are
wanting
other
peoples
are
to
be
found
in
the
new
world
beside
the
and
as
these
peoples
are
affected
by
the
same
physical
circumstances
as
the
latter
they
may
fairly
be
compared
together
but
there
are
no
nations
out
of
america
which
have
adopted
the
same
laws
and
manners
being
destitute
of
the
physical
advantages
peculiar
to
the
no
standard
of
comparison
therefore
exists
and
we
can
only
hazard
an
opinion
upon
this
subject
it
appears
to
me
in
the
first
place
that
a
careful
distinction
must
be
made
between
the
institutions
of
the
united
states
and
democratic
institutions
in
general
when
i
reflect
upon
the
state
of
europe
its
mighty
nations
its
populous
cities
its
formidable
armies
and
the
complex
nature
of
its
politics
i
can
not
suppose
that
even
the
if
they
were
transported
to
our
hemisphere
with
their
ideas
their
religion
and
their
manners
could
exist
without
considerably
altering
their
laws
but
a
democratic
nation
may
be
imagined
organized
differently
from
the
american
people
it
is
not
impossible
to
conceive
a
government
really
established
upon
the
will
of
the
majority
but
in
which
the
majority
repressing
its
natural
propensity
to
equality
should
consent
with
a
view
to
the
order
and
the
stability
of
the
state
to
invest
a
family
or
an
individual
with
all
the
prerogatives
of
the
executive
a
democratic
society
might
exist
in
which
the
forces
of
the
nation
would
be
more
centralized
than
they
are
in
the
united
states
the
people
would
exercise
a
less
direct
and
less
irresistible
influence
upon
public
affairs
and
yet
every
citizen
invested
with
certain
rights
would
participate
within
his
sphere
in
the
conduct
of
the
government
the
observations
i
made
among
the
induce
me
to
believe
that
democratic
institutions
of
this
kind
prudently
introduced
into
society
so
as
gradually
to
mix
with
the
habits
and
to
be
infused
with
the
opinions
of
the
people
might
subsist
in
other
countries
beside
america
if
the
laws
of
the
united
states
were
the
only
imaginable
democratic
laws
or
the
most
perfect
which
it
is
possible
to
conceive
i
should
admit
that
the
success
of
those
institutions
affords
no
proof
of
the
success
of
democratic
institutions
in
general
in
a
country
less
favored
by
natural
circumstances
but
as
the
laws
of
america
appear
to
me
to
be
defective
in
several
respects
and
as
i
can
readily
imagine
others
of
the
same
general
nature
the
peculiar
advantages
of
that
country
do
not
prove
that
democratic
institutions
can
not
succeed
in
a
nation
less
favored
by
circumstances
if
ruled
by
better
laws
if
human
nature
were
different
in
america
from
what
it
is
elsewhere
or
if
the
social
condition
of
the
americans
engendered
habits
and
opinions
among
them
different
from
those
which
originate
in
the
same
social
condition
in
the
old
world
the
american
democracies
would
afford
no
means
of
predicting
what
may
occur
in
other
democracies
if
the
americans
displayed
the
same
propensities
as
all
other
democratic
nations
and
if
their
legislators
had
relied
upon
the
nature
of
the
country
and
the
favor
of
circumstances
to
restrain
those
propensities
within
due
limits
the
prosperity
of
the
united
states
would
be
exclusively
attributable
to
physical
causes
and
it
would
afford
no
encouragement
to
a
people
inclined
to
imitate
their
example
without
sharing
their
natural
advantages
but
neither
of
these
suppositions
is
borne
out
by
facts
in
america
the
same
passions
are
to
be
met
with
as
in
europe
some
originating
in
human
nature
others
in
the
democratic
condition
of
society
thus
in
the
united
states
i
found
that
restlessness
of
heart
which
is
natural
to
men
when
all
ranks
are
nearly
equal
and
the
chances
of
elevation
are
the
same
to
all
i
found
the
democratic
feeling
of
envy
expressed
under
a
thousand
different
forms
i
remarked
that
the
people
frequently
displayed
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
a
consummate
mixture
of
ignorance
and
presumption
and
i
inferred
that
in
america
men
are
liable
to
the
same
failings
and
the
same
absurdities
as
among
ourselves
but
upon
examining
the
state
of
society
more
attentively
i
speedily
discovered
that
the
americans
had
made
great
and
successful
efforts
to
counteract
these
imperfections
of
human
nature
and
to
correct
the
natural
defects
of
democracy
their
divers
municipal
laws
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
means
of
restraining
the
ambition
of
the
citizens
within
a
narrow
sphere
and
of
turning
those
same
passions
which
might
have
worked
havoc
in
the
state
to
the
good
of
the
township
or
the
parish
the
american
legislators
have
succeeded
to
a
certain
extent
in
opposing
the
notion
of
rights
to
the
feelings
of
envy
the
permanence
of
the
religious
world
to
the
continual
shifting
of
politics
the
experience
of
the
people
to
its
theoretical
ignorance
and
its
practical
knowledge
of
business
to
the
impatience
of
its
desires
the
americans
then
have
not
relied
upon
the
nature
of
their
country
to
counterpoise
those
dangers
which
originate
in
their
constitution
and
in
their
political
laws
to
evils
which
are
common
to
all
democratic
peoples
they
have
applied
remedies
which
none
but
themselves
had
ever
thought
of
before
and
although
they
were
the
first
to
make
the
experiment
they
have
succeeded
in
it
the
manners
and
laws
of
the
americans
are
not
the
only
ones
which
may
suit
a
democratic
people
but
the
americans
have
shown
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
despair
of
regulating
democracy
by
the
aid
of
manners
and
of
laws
if
other
nations
should
borrow
this
general
and
pregnant
idea
from
the
americans
without
however
intending
to
imitate
them
in
the
peculiar
application
which
they
have
made
of
it
if
they
should
attempt
to
fit
themselves
for
that
social
condition
which
it
seems
to
be
the
will
of
providence
to
impose
upon
the
generations
of
this
age
and
so
to
escape
from
the
despotism
of
the
anarchy
which
threatens
them
what
reason
is
there
to
suppose
that
their
efforts
would
not
be
crowned
with
success
the
organization
and
the
establishment
of
democracy
in
christendom
is
the
great
political
problem
of
the
time
the
americans
unquestionably
have
not
resolved
this
problem
but
they
furnish
useful
data
to
those
who
undertake
the
task
importance
of
what
precedes
with
respect
to
the
state
of
europe
it
may
readily
be
discovered
with
what
intention
i
undertook
the
foregoing
inquiries
the
question
here
discussed
is
interesting
not
only
to
the
united
states
but
to
the
whole
world
it
concerns
not
a
nation
but
all
mankind
if
those
nations
whose
social
condition
is
democratic
could
only
remain
free
as
long
as
they
are
inhabitants
of
the
wilds
we
could
not
but
despair
of
the
future
destiny
of
the
human
race
for
democracy
is
rapidly
acquiring
a
more
extended
sway
and
the
wilds
are
gradually
peopled
with
men
if
it
were
true
that
laws
and
manners
are
insufficient
to
maintain
democratic
institutions
what
refuge
would
remain
open
to
the
nations
except
the
despotism
of
a
single
individual
i
am
aware
that
there
are
many
worthy
persons
at
the
present
time
who
are
not
alarmed
at
this
latter
alternative
and
who
are
so
tired
of
liberty
as
to
be
glad
of
repose
far
from
those
storms
by
which
it
is
attended
but
these
individuals
are
ill
acquainted
with
the
haven
to
which
they
are
bound
they
are
so
deluded
by
their
recollections
as
to
judge
the
tendency
of
absolute
power
by
what
it
was
formerly
and
not
what
it
might
become
at
the
present
time
if
absolute
power
were
among
the
democratic
nations
of
europe
i
am
persuaded
that
it
would
assume
a
new
form
and
appear
under
features
unknown
to
our
forefathers
there
was
a
time
in
europe
when
the
laws
and
the
consent
of
the
people
had
invested
princes
with
almost
unlimited
authority
but
they
scarcely
ever
availed
themselves
of
it
i
do
not
speak
of
the
prerogatives
of
the
nobility
of
the
authority
of
supreme
courts
of
justice
of
corporations
and
their
chartered
rights
or
of
provincial
privileges
which
served
to
break
the
blows
of
the
sovereign
authority
and
to
maintain
a
spirit
of
resistance
in
the
nation
independently
of
these
political
institutions
which
however
opposed
they
might
be
to
personal
liberty
served
to
keep
alive
the
love
of
freedom
in
the
mind
of
the
public
and
which
may
be
esteemed
to
have
been
useful
in
this
respect
the
manners
and
opinions
of
the
nation
confined
the
royal
authority
within
barriers
which
were
not
less
powerful
although
they
were
less
conspicuous
religion
the
affections
of
the
people
the
benevolence
of
the
prince
the
sense
of
honor
family
pride
provincial
prejudices
custom
and
public
opinion
limited
the
power
of
kings
and
restrained
their
authority
within
an
invisible
circle
the
constitution
of
nations
was
despotic
at
that
time
but
their
manners
were
free
princes
had
the
right
but
they
had
neither
the
means
nor
the
desire
of
doing
whatever
they
pleased
but
what
now
remains
of
those
barriers
which
formerly
arrested
the
aggressions
of
tyranny
since
religion
has
lost
its
empire
over
the
souls
of
men
the
most
prominent
boundary
which
divided
good
from
evil
is
overthrown
the
very
elements
of
the
moral
world
are
indeterminate
the
princes
and
the
peoples
of
the
earth
are
guided
by
chance
and
none
can
define
the
natural
limits
of
despotism
and
the
bounds
of
license
long
revolutions
have
for
ever
destroyed
the
respect
which
surrounded
the
rulers
of
the
state
and
since
they
have
been
relieved
from
the
burden
of
public
esteem
princes
may
henceforward
surrender
themselves
without
fear
to
the
seductions
of
arbitrary
power
when
kings
find
that
the
hearts
of
their
subjects
are
turned
toward
them
they
are
clement
because
they
are
conscious
of
their
strength
and
they
are
chary
of
the
affection
of
their
people
because
the
affection
of
their
people
is
the
bulwark
of
the
throne
a
mutual
interchange
of
good
will
then
takes
place
between
the
prince
and
the
people
which
resembles
the
gracious
intercourse
of
domestic
society
the
subjects
may
murmur
at
the
sovereign
decree
but
they
are
grieved
to
displease
him
and
the
sovereign
chastises
his
subjects
with
the
light
hand
of
parental
affection
but
when
once
the
spell
of
royalty
is
broken
in
the
tumult
of
revolution
when
successive
monarchs
have
occupied
the
throne
and
alternately
displayed
to
the
people
the
weakness
of
right
and
the
harshness
of
power
the
sovereign
is
no
longer
regarded
by
any
as
the
father
of
the
state
and
he
is
feared
by
all
as
its
master
if
he
be
weak
he
is
despised
if
he
be
strong
he
is
detested
he
is
himself
full
of
animosity
and
alarm
he
finds
that
he
is
a
stranger
in
his
own
country
and
he
treats
his
subjects
like
conquered
enemies
when
the
provinces
and
the
towns
formed
so
many
different
nations
in
the
midst
of
their
common
country
each
of
them
had
a
will
of
its
own
which
was
opposed
to
the
general
spirit
of
subjection
but
now
that
all
the
parts
of
the
same
empire
after
having
lost
their
immunities
their
customs
their
prejudices
their
traditions
and
their
names
are
subjected
and
accustomed
to
the
same
laws
it
is
not
more
difficult
to
oppress
them
collectively
than
it
was
formerly
to
oppress
them
singly
while
the
nobles
enjoyed
their
power
and
indeed
long
after
that
power
was
lost
the
honor
of
aristocracy
conferred
an
extraordinary
degree
of
force
upon
their
personal
opposition
they
afforded
instances
of
men
who
notwithstanding
their
weakness
still
entertained
a
high
opinion
of
their
personal
value
and
dared
to
cope
with
the
efforts
of
the
public
authority
but
at
the
present
day
when
all
ranks
are
more
and
more
confounded
when
the
individual
disappears
in
the
throng
and
is
easily
lost
in
the
midst
of
a
common
obscurity
when
the
honor
of
monarchy
has
almost
lost
its
empire
without
being
succeeded
by
public
virtue
and
when
nothing
can
enable
man
to
rise
above
himself
who
shall
say
at
what
point
the
exigencies
of
power
and
servility
of
weakness
will
stop
as
long
as
family
feeling
was
kept
alive
the
antagonist
of
oppression
was
never
alone
he
looked
about
him
and
found
his
clients
his
hereditary
friends
and
his
kinsfolk
if
this
support
was
wanting
he
was
sustained
by
his
ancestors
and
animated
by
his
posterity
but
when
patrimonial
estates
are
divided
and
when
a
few
years
suffice
to
confound
the
distinctions
of
a
race
where
can
family
feeling
be
found
what
force
can
there
be
in
the
customs
of
a
country
which
has
changed
and
is
still
perpetually
changing
its
aspect
in
which
every
act
of
tyranny
has
a
precedent
and
every
crime
an
example
in
which
there
is
nothing
so
old
that
its
antiquity
can
save
it
from
destruction
and
nothing
so
unparalleled
that
its
novelty
can
prevent
it
from
being
done
what
resistance
can
be
offered
by
manners
of
so
pliant
a
make
that
they
have
already
often
yielded
what
strength
can
even
public
opinion
have
retained
when
no
twenty
persons
are
connected
by
a
common
tie
when
not
a
man
nor
a
family
nor
chartered
corporation
nor
class
nor
free
institution
has
the
power
of
representing
that
opinion
and
when
every
citizen
being
equally
weak
equally
poor
and
equally
dependant
has
only
his
personal
impotence
to
oppose
to
the
organized
force
of
the
government
the
annals
of
france
furnish
nothing
analogous
to
the
condition
in
which
that
country
might
then
be
thrown
but
it
may
more
aptly
be
assimilated
to
the
times
of
old
and
to
those
hideous
eras
of
roman
oppression
when
the
manners
of
the
people
were
corrupted
their
traditions
obliterated
their
habits
destroyed
their
opinions
shaken
and
freedom
expelled
from
the
laws
could
find
no
refuge
in
the
land
when
nothing
protected
the
citizens
and
the
citizens
no
longer
protected
themselves
when
human
nature
was
the
sport
of
man
and
princes
wearied
out
the
clemency
of
heaven
before
they
exhausted
the
patience
of
their
subjects
those
who
hope
to
revive
the
monarchy
of
henry
iv
or
of
louis
appear
to
me
to
be
afflicted
with
mental
blindness
and
when
i
consider
the
present
condition
of
several
european
nations
a
condition
to
which
all
the
others
tend
i
am
led
to
believe
that
they
will
soon
be
left
with
no
other
alternative
than
democratic
liberty
or
the
tyranny
of
the
caesars
and
indeed
it
is
deserving
of
consideration
whether
men
are
to
be
entirely
emancipated
or
entirely
enslaved
whether
their
rights
are
to
be
made
equal
or
wholly
taken
away
from
them
if
the
rulers
of
society
were
reduced
either
gradually
to
raise
the
crowd
to
their
own
level
or
to
sink
the
citizens
below
that
of
humanity
would
not
the
doubts
of
many
be
resolved
the
consciences
of
many
be
healed
and
the
community
be
prepared
to
make
great
sacrifices
with
little
difficulty
in
that
case
the
gradual
growth
of
democratic
manners
and
institutions
should
be
regarded
not
as
the
best
but
as
the
only
means
of
preserving
freedom
and
without
liking
the
government
of
democracy
it
might
be
adopted
as
the
most
applicable
and
the
fairest
remedy
for
the
present
ills
of
society
it
is
difficult
to
associate
a
people
in
the
work
of
government
but
it
is
still
more
difficult
to
supply
it
with
experience
and
to
inspire
it
with
the
feelings
which
it
requires
in
order
to
govern
well
i
grant
that
the
caprices
of
democracy
are
perpetual
its
instruments
are
rude
its
laws
imperfect
but
if
it
were
true
that
soon
no
just
medium
would
exist
between
the
empire
of
democracy
and
the
dominion
of
a
single
arm
should
we
not
rather
incline
toward
the
former
than
submit
voluntarily
to
the
latter
and
if
complete
equality
be
our
fate
is
it
not
better
to
be
levelled
by
free
institutions
than
by
despotic
power
those
who
after
having
read
this
book
should
imagine
that
my
intention
in
writing
it
has
been
to
propose
the
laws
and
manners
of
the
for
the
imitation
of
all
democratic
peoples
would
commit
a
very
great
mistake
they
must
have
paid
more
attention
to
the
form
than
to
the
substance
of
my
ideas
my
aim
has
been
to
show
by
the
example
of
america
that
laws
and
especially
manners
may
exist
which
will
allow
a
democratic
people
to
remain
free
but
i
am
very
far
from
thinking
that
we
ought
to
follow
the
example
of
the
american
democracy
and
copy
the
means
which
it
has
employed
to
attain
its
ends
for
i
am
well
aware
of
the
influence
which
the
nature
of
a
country
and
its
political
precedents
exercise
upon
a
constitution
and
i
should
regard
it
as
a
great
misfortune
for
mankind
if
liberty
were
to
exist
all
over
the
world
under
the
same
forms
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
gradually
introducing
democratic
institutions
into
france
and
if
we
despair
of
imparting
to
the
citizens
those
ideas
and
sentiments
which
first
prepare
them
for
freedom
and
afterward
allow
them
to
enjoy
it
there
will
be
no
independence
at
all
either
for
the
middling
classes
or
the
nobility
for
the
poor
or
for
the
rich
but
an
equal
tyranny
over
all
and
i
foresee
that
if
the
peaceable
empire
of
the
majority
be
not
founded
among
us
in
time
we
shall
sooner
or
later
arrive
at
the
unlimited
authority
of
a
single
despot
notes
the
united
states
have
no
metropolis
but
they
already
contain
several
very
large
cities
philadelphia
reckoned
inhabitants
and
new
york
in
the
year
the
lower
orders
which
inhabit
these
cities
constitute
a
rabble
even
more
formidable
than
the
populace
of
european
towns
they
consist
of
freed
blacks
in
the
first
place
who
are
condemned
by
the
laws
and
by
public
opinion
to
an
hereditary
state
of
misery
and
degradation
they
also
contain
a
multitude
of
europeans
who
have
been
driven
to
the
shores
of
the
new
world
by
their
misfortunes
or
their
misconduct
and
these
men
inoculate
the
united
states
with
all
our
vices
without
bringing
with
them
any
of
those
interests
which
counteract
their
baneful
influence
as
inhabitants
of
a
country
where
they
have
no
civil
rights
they
are
ready
to
turn
all
the
passions
which
agitate
the
community
to
their
own
advantage
thus
within
the
last
few
months
serious
riots
have
broken
out
in
philadelphia
and
in
new
york
disturbances
of
this
kind
are
unknown
in
the
rest
of
the
country
which
is
nowise
alarmed
by
them
because
the
population
of
the
cities
has
hitherto
exercised
neither
power
nor
influence
over
the
rural
districts
nevertheless
i
look
upon
the
size
of
certain
american
cities
and
especially
on
the
nature
of
their
population
as
a
real
danger
which
threatens
the
future
security
of
the
democratic
republics
of
the
new
world
and
i
venture
to
predict
that
they
will
perish
from
this
circumstance
unless
the
government
succeed
in
creating
an
armed
force
which
while
it
remains
under
the
control
of
the
majority
of
the
nation
will
be
independent
of
the
town
population
and
able
to
repress
its
excesses
in
new
england
the
estates
are
exceedingly
small
but
they
are
rarely
subjected
to
farther
division
the
new
york
spectator
of
august
relates
the
fact
in
the
following
terms
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
chester
county
new
york
a
few
days
since
rejected
a
witness
who
declared
his
disbelief
in
the
existence
of
god
the
presiding
judge
remarked
that
he
had
not
before
been
aware
that
there
was
a
man
living
who
did
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
god
that
this
belief
constituted
the
sanction
of
all
testimony
in
a
court
of
justice
and
that
he
knew
of
no
cause
in
a
christian
country
where
a
witness
had
been
permitted
to
testify
without
such
belief
the
instance
given
by
the
author
of
a
person
offered
as
a
witness
having
been
rejected
on
the
ground
that
he
did
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
god
seems
to
be
adduced
to
prove
either
his
assertion
that
the
americans
hold
religion
to
be
indispensable
to
the
maintenance
of
republican
institutions
or
his
assertion
that
if
a
man
attacks
all
the
sects
together
every
one
abandons
him
and
he
remains
alone
but
it
is
questionable
how
far
the
fact
quoted
proves
either
of
these
positions
the
rule
which
prescribes
as
a
qualification
for
a
witness
the
belief
in
a
supreme
being
who
will
punish
falsehood
without
which
he
is
deemed
wholly
incompetent
to
testify
is
established
for
the
protection
of
personal
rights
and
not
to
compel
the
adoption
of
any
system
of
religious
belief
it
came
with
all
our
fundamental
principles
from
england
as
a
part
of
the
common
law
which
the
colonists
brought
with
them
it
is
supposed
to
prevail
in
every
country
in
christendom
whatever
may
be
the
form
of
its
government
and
the
only
doubt
that
arises
respecting
its
existence
in
france
is
created
by
our
apparent
surprise
at
finding
such
a
rule
in
unless
this
term
be
applied
to
the
functions
which
many
of
them
fill
in
the
schools
almost
all
education
is
intrusted
to
the
clergy
see

whereas
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
are
by
their
profession
dedicated
to
the
service
of
god
and
the
care
of
souls

ought
not
to
be

from

great
duties

travelled
along
a
portion
of
the
frontier
of
the

in
a
sort
of
cart
which
was
termed
the
mail
we
passed
day
and
night
with
great
rapidity
along
roads
which
were
scarcely
marked
out
through
immense
forests
when
the
gloom
of
the
woods
became
impenetrable
the
coachman
lighted
branches
of
fir
and
we
journied
along
by
the
light

cast
from
time
to
time
we
came
to
a
hut
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
which
was
a
postoffice
the
mail
dropped
an
enormous
bundle
of
letters
at
the
door
of
this
isolated
dwelling
and
we
pursued
our
way
at
full
gallop
leaving
the

neighboring

the

of

are

to

the

which
contains

is
one
of
the
most
enlightened
and

parts
of

i
remind
the
reader
of
the
general
signification
which
i
give
to
the
word
namely
the
moral
and
intellectual
characteristics
of
social
man
taken
collectively
chapter
xviii
the
present
and
probable
future
condition
of
the
three
races
which
inhabit
the
territory
of
the
united
states
the
principal
part
of
the
task
which
i
had
imposed
upon
myself
is
now
performed
i
have
shown
as
far
as
i
was
able
the
laws
and
manners
of
the
american
democracy
here
i
might
stop
but
the
reader
would
perhaps
feel
that
i
had
not
satisfied
his
expectations
the
absolute
supremacy
of
democracy
is
not
all
that
we
meet
with
in
america
the
inhabitants
of
the
new
world
may
be
considered
from
more
than
one
point
of
view
in
the
course
of
this
work
my
subject
has
often
led
me
to
speak
of
the
indians
and
the
negroes
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
stop
in
order
to
show
what
places
these
two
races
occupy
in
the
midst
of
the
democratic
people
whom
i
was
engaged
in
describing
i
have
mentioned
in
what
spirit
and
according
to
what
laws
the
union
was
formed
but
i
could
only
glance
at
the
dangers
which
menace
that
confederation
while
it
was
equally
impossible
for
me
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
its
chances
of
duration
independently
of
its
laws
and
manners
when
speaking
of
the
united
republican
states
i
hazarded
no
conjectures
upon
the
permanence
of
republican
forms
in
the
new
world
and
when
making
frequent
allusion
to
the
commercial
activity
which
reigns
in
the
union
i
was
unable
to
inquire
into
the
future
condition
of
the
americans
as
a
commercial
people
these
topics
are
collaterally
connected
with
my
subject
without
forming
a
part
of
it
they
are
american
without
being
democratic
and
to
portray
democracy
has
been
my
principal
aim
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
postpone
these
questions
which
i
now
take
up
as
the
proper
termination
of
my
work
the
territory
now
occupied
or
claimed
by
the
american
union
spreads
from
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
to
those
of
the
pacific
ocean
on
the
east
and
west
its
limits
are
those
of
the
continent
itself
on
the
south
it
advances
nearly
to
the
tropic
and
it
extends
upward
to
the
icy
regions
of
the
north
the
human
beings
who
are
scattered
over
this
space
do
not
form
as
in
europe
so
many
branches
of
the
same
stock
three
races
naturally
distinct
and
i
might
almost
say
hostile
to
each
other
are
discoverable
among
them
at
the
first
glance
almost
insurmountable
barriers
had
been
raised
between
them
by
education
and
by
law
as
well
as
by
their
origin
and
outward
characteristics
but
fortune
has
brought
them
together
on
the
same
soil
where
although
they
are
mixed
they
do
not
amalgamate
and
each
race
fulfils
its
destiny
apart
among
these
widely
differing
families
of
men
the
first
which
attracts
attention
the
superior
in
intelligence
in
power
and
in
enjoyment
is
the
white
or
european
the
man
and
in
subordinate
grades
the
negro
and
the
indian
these
two
unhappy
races
have
nothing
in
common
neither
birth
nor
features
nor
language
nor
habits
their
only
resemblance
lies
in
their
misfortunes
both
of
them
occupy
an
inferior
rank
in
the
country
they
inhabit
both
suffer
from
tyranny
and
if
their
wrongs
are
not
the
same
they
originate
at
any
rate
with
the
same
authors
if
we
reasoned
from
what
passes
in
the
world
we
should
almost
say
that
the
european
is
to
the
other
races
of
mankind
what
man
is
to
the
lower
animals
he
makes
them
subservient
to
his
use
and
when
he
can
not
subdue
he
destroys
them
oppression
has
at
one
stroke
deprived
the
descendants
of
the
africans
of
almost
all
the
privileges
of
humanity
the
negro
of
the
united
states
has
lost
all
remembrance
of
his
country
the
language
which
his
forefathers
spoke
is
never
heard
around
him
he
abjured
their
religion
and
forgot
their
customs
when
he
ceased
to
belong
to
africa
without
acquiring
any
claim
to
european
privileges
but
he
remains
between
the
two
communities
sold
by
the
one
repulsed
by
the
other
finding
not
a
spot
in
the
universe
to
call
by
the
name
of
country
except
the
faint
image
of
a
home
which
the
shelter
of
his
master
roof
affords
the
negro
has
no
family
woman
is
merely
the
temporary
companion
of
his
pleasures
and
his
children
are
upon
an
equality
with
himself
from
the
moment
of
their
birth
am
i
to
call
it
a
proof
of
god
mercy
or
a
visitation
of
his
wrath
that
man
in
certain
states
appears
to
be
insensible
to
his
extreme
wretchedness
and
almost
affects
with
a
depraved
taste
the
cause
of
his
misfortunes
the
negro
who
is
plunged
in
this
abyss
of
evils
scarcely
feels
his
own
calamitous
situation
violence
made
him
a
slave
and
the
habit
of
servitude
gives
him
the
thoughts
and
desires
of
a
slave
he
admires
his
tyrants
more
than
he
hates
them
and
finds
his
joy
and
his
pride
in
the
servile
imitation
of
those
who
oppress
him
his
understanding
is
degraded
to
the
level
of
his
soul
the
negro
enters
upon
slavery
as
soon
as
he
is
born
nay
he
may
have
been
purchased
in
the
womb
and
have
begun
his
slavery
before
he
began
his
existence
equally
devoid
of
wants
and
of
enjoyment
and
useless
to
himself
he
learns
with
his
first
notions
of
existence
that
he
is
the
property
of
another
who
has
an
interest
in
preserving
his
life
and
that
the
care
of
it
does
not
devolve
upon
himself
even
the
power
of
thought
appears
to
him
a
useless
gift
of
providence
and
he
quietly
enjoys
the
privileges
of
his
debasement
if
he
becomes
free
independence
is
often
felt
by
him
to
be
a
heavier
burden
than
slavery
for
having
learned
in
the
course
of
his
life
to
submit
to
everything
except
reason
he
is
too
much
unacquainted
with
her
dictates
to
obey
them
a
thousand
new
desires
beset
him
and
he
is
destitute
of
the
knowledge
and
energy
necessary
to
resist
them
these
are
masters
which
it
is
necessary
to
contend
with
and
he
has
learned
only
to
submit
and
obey
in
short
he
sinks
to
such
a
depth
of
wretchedness
that
while
servitude
brutalizes
liberty
destroys
him
oppression
has
been
no
less
fatal
to
the
indian
than
to
the
negro
race
but
its
effects
are
different
before
the
arrival
of
the
white
men
in
the
new
world
the
inhabitants
of
north
america
lived
quietly
in
their
woods
enduring
the
vicissitudes
and
practising
the
virtues
and
vices
common
to
savage
nations
the
europeans
having
dispersed
the
indian
tribes
and
driven
them
into
the
deserts
condemned
them
to
a
wandering
life
full
of
inexpressible
sufferings
savage
nations
are
only
controlled
by
opinion
and
by
custom
when
the
north
american
indians
had
lost
their
sentiment
of
attachment
to
their
country
when
their
families
were
dispersed
their
traditions
obscured
and
the
chain
of
their
recollections
broken
when
all
their
habits
were
changed
and
their
wants
increased
beyond
measure
european
tyranny
rendered
them
more
disorderly
and
less
civilized
than
they
were
before
the
moral
and
physical
condition
of
these
tribes
continually
grew
worse
and
they
became
more
barbarous
as
they
became
more
wretched
nevertheless
the
europeans
have
not
been
able
to
metamorphose
the
character
of
the
indians
and
though
they
have
had
power
to
destroy
them
they
have
never
been
able
to
make
them
submit
to
the
rules
of
civilized
society
the
lot
of
the
negro
is
placed
on
the
extreme
limit
of
servitude
while
that
of
the
indian
lies
on
the
utmost
verge
of
liberty
and
slavery
does
not
produce
more
fatal
effects
upon
the
first
than
independence
upon
the
second
the
negro
has
lost
all
property
in
his
own
person
and
he
can
not
dispose
of
his
existence
without
committing
a
sort
of
fraud
but
the
savage
is
his
own
master
as
soon
as
he
is
able
to
act
parental
authority
is
scarcely
known
to
him
he
has
never
bent
his
will
to
that
of
any
of
his
kind
or
learned
the
difference
between
voluntary
obedience
and
a
shameful
subjection
and
the
very
name
of
law
is
unknown
to
him
to
be
free
with
him
signifies
to
escape
from
all
the
shackles
of
society
as
he
delights
in
this
barbarous
independence
and
would
rather
perish
than
sacrifice
the
least
part
of
it
civilisation
has
little
power
over
him
the
negro
makes
a
thousand
fruitless
efforts
to
insinuate
himself
among
men
who
repulse
him
he
conforms
to
the
taste
of
his
oppressors
adopts
their
opinions
and
hopes
by
imitating
them
to
form
a
part
of
their
community
having
been
told
from
infancy
that
his
race
is
naturally
inferior
to
that
of
the
whites
he
assents
to
the
proposition
and
is
ashamed
of
his
own
nature
in
each
of
his
features
he
discovers
a
trace
of
slavery
and
if
it
were
in
his
power
he
would
willingly
rid
himself
of
everything
that
makes
him
what
he
is
the
indian
on
the
contrary
has
his
imagination
inflated
with
the
pretended
nobility
of
his
origin
and
lives
and
dies
in
the
midst
of
these
dreams
of
pride
far
from
desiring
to
conform
his
habits
to
ours
he
loves
his
savage
life
as
the
distinguishing
mark
of
his
race
and
he
repels
every
advance
to
civilisation
less
perhaps
from
the
hatred
which
he
entertains
for
it
than
from
a
dread
of
resembling
the
europeans
while
he
has
nothing
to
oppose
to
our
perfection
in
the
arts
but
the
resources
of
the
desert
to
our
tactics
nothing
but
undisciplined
courage
while
our
plans
are
met
by
the
spontaneous
instincts
of
savage
life
who
can
wonder
if
he
fails
in
this
unequal
contest
the
negro
who
earnestly
desires
to
mingle
his
race
with
that
of
the
european
can
not
effect
it
while
the
indian
who
might
succeed
to
a
certain
extent
disdains
to
make
the
attempt
the
servility
of
the
one
dooms
him
to
slavery
the
pride
of
the
other
to
death
i
remember
that
while
i
was
travelling
through
the
forests
which
still
cover
the
state
of
alabama
i
arrived
one
day
at
the
log
house
of
a
pioneer
i
did
not
wish
to
penetrate
into
the
dwelling
of
the
american
but
retired
to
rest
myself
for
a
while
on
the
margin
of
a
spring
which
was
not
far
off
in
the
woods
while
i
was
in
this
place
which
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
creek
territory
an
indian
woman
appeared
followed
by
a
negress
and
holding
by
the
hand
a
little
white
girl
of
five
or
six
years
old
whom
i
took
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
pioneer
a
sort
of
barbarous
luxury
set
off
the
costume
of
the
indian
rings
of
metal
were
hanging
from
her
nostrils
and
ears
her
hair
which
was
adorned
with
glass
beads
fell
loosely
upon
her
shoulders
and
i
saw
that
she
was
not
married
for
she
still
wore
the
necklace
of
shells
which
the
bride
always
deposits
on
the
nuptial
couch
the
negress
was
clad
in
squalid
european
garments
they
all
three
came
and
seated
themselves
upon
the
banks
of
the
fountain
and
the
young
indian
taking
the
child
in
her
arms
lavished
upon
her
such
fond
caresses
as
mothers
give
while
the
negress
endeavored
by
various
little
artifices
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
young
creole
the
child
displayed
in
her
slightest
gestures
a
consciousness
of
superiority
which
formed
a
strange
contrast
with
her
infantine
weakness
as
if
she
received
the
attentions
of
her
companions
with
a
sort
of
condescension
the
negress
was
seated
on
the
ground
before
her
mistress
watching
her
smallest
desires
and
apparently
divided
between
strong
affection
for
the
child
and
servile
fear
while
the
savage
displayed
in
the
midst
of
her
tenderness
an
air
of
freedom
and
of
pride
which
was
almost
ferocious
i
had
approached
the
group
and
i
contemplated
them
in
silence
but
my
curiosity
was
probably
displeasing
to
the
indian
woman
for
she
suddenly
rose
pushed
the
child
roughly
from
her
and
giving
me
an
angry
look
plunged
into
the
thicket
i
had
often
chanced
to
see
individuals
met
together
in
the
same
place
who
belonged
to
the
three
races
of
men
which
people
north
america
i
had
perceived
from
many
different
results
the
preponderance
of
the
whites
but
in
the
picture
which
i
have
just
been
describing
there
was
something
peculiarly
touching
a
bond
of
affection
here
united
the
oppressors
with
the
oppressed
and
the
effort
of
nature
to
bring
them
together
rendered
still
more
striking
the
immense
distance
placed
between
them
by
prejudice
and
by
law
the
present
and
probable
future
condition
of
the
indian
tribes
which
inhabit
the
territory
possessed
by
the
union
gradual
disappearance
of
the
native
manner
in
which
it
takes
miseries
accompanying
the
forced
migrations
of
the
the
savages
of
north
america
had
only
two
ways
of
escaping
destruction
war
or
they
are
no
longer
able
to
make
reasons
why
they
refused
to
become
civilized
when
it
was
in
their
power
and
why
they
can
not
become
so
now
that
they
desire
instance
of
the
creek
and
policy
of
the
particular
states
toward
these
policy
of
the
federal
government
none
of
the
indian
tribes
which
formerly
inhabited
the
territory
of
new
england
the
narragansets
the
mohicans
the
pequots
have
any
existence
but
in
the
recollection
of
man
the
lenapes
who
received
william
penn
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
upon
the
banks
of
the
delaware
have
disappeared
and
i
myself
met
with
the
last
of
the
iroquois
who
were
begging
alms
the
nations
i
have
mentioned
formerly
covered
the
country
to
the
seacoast
but
a
traveller
at
the
present
day
must
penetrate
more
than
a
hundred
leagues
into
the
interior
of
the
continent
to
find
an
indian
not
only
have
these
wild
tribes
receded
but
they
are
destroyed
and
as
they
give
way
or
perish
an
immense
and
increasing
people
fills
their
place
there
is
no
instance
on
record
of
so
prodigious
a
growth
or
so
rapid
a
destruction
the
manner
in
which
the
latter
change
takes
place
is
not
difficult
to
describe
when
the
indians
were
the
sole
inhabitants
of
the
wilds
whence
they
have
been
expelled
their
wants
were
few
their
arms
were
of
their
own
manufacture
their
only
drink
was
the
water
of
the
brook
and
their
clothes
consisted
of
the
skin
of
animals
whose
flesh
furnished
them
with
food
the
europeans
introduced
among
the
savages
of
north
america
firearms
ardent
spirits
and
iron
they
taught
them
to
exchange
for
manufactured
stuffs
the
rough
garments
which
had
previously
satisfied
their
untutored
simplicity
having
acquired
new
tastes
without
the
arts
by
which
they
could
be
gratified
the
indians
were
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
the
workmanship
of
the
whites
but
in
return
for
their
productions
the
savage
had
nothing
to
offer
except
the
rich
furs
which
still
abounded
in
his
woods
hence
the
chase
became
necessary
not
merely
to
provide
for
his
subsistence
but
in
order
to
procure
the
only
objects
of
barter
which
he
could
furnish
to
europe
while
the
wants
of
the
natives
were
thus
increasing
their
resources
continued
to
diminish
from
the
moment
when
a
european
settlement
is
formed
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
territory
occupied
by
the
indians
the
beasts
of
chase
take
the
alarm
thousands
of
savages
wandering
in
the
forest
and
destitute
of
any
fixed
dwelling
did
not
disturb
them
but
as
soon
as
the
continuous
sounds
of
european
labor
are
heard
in
the
neighborhood
they
begin
to
flee
away
and
retire
to
the
west
where
their
instinct
teaches
them
that
they
will
find
deserts
of
immeasurable
extent
the
buffalo
is
constantly
receding
say
clarke
and
cass
in
their
report
of
the
year
a
few
years
since
they
approached
the
base
of
the
allegany
and
a
few
years
hence
they
may
even
be
rare
upon
the
immense
plains
which
extend
to
the
base
of
the
rocky
mountains
i
have
been
assured
that
this
effect
of
the
approach
of
the
whites
is
often
felt
at
two
hundred
leagues
distance
from
the
frontier
their
influence
is
thus
exerted
over
tribes
whose
name
is
unknown
to
them
and
who
suffer
the
evils
of
usurpation
long
before
they
are
acquainted
with
the
authors
of
their
distress
bold
adventurers
soon
penetrate
into
the
country
the
indians
have
deserted
and
when
they
have
advanced
about
fifteen
or
twenty
leagues
from
the
extreme
frontiers
of
the
whites
they
begin
to
build
habitations
for
civilized
beings
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
this
is
done
without
difficulty
as
the
territory
of
a
hunting
nation
is
ill
defined
it
is
the
common
property
of
the
tribe
and
belongs
to
no
one
in
particular
so
that
individual
interests
are
not
concerned
in
the
protection
of
any
part
of
it
a
few
european
families
settled
in
different
situations
at
a
considerable
distance
from
each
other
soon
drive
away
the
wild
animals
which
remain
between
their
places
of
abode
the
indians
who
had
previously
lived
in
a
sort
of
abundance
then
find
it
difficult
to
subsist
and
still
more
difficult
to
procure
the
articles
of
barter
which
they
stand
in
need
of
to
drive
away
their
game
is
to
deprive
them
of
the
means
of
existence
as
effectually
as
if
the
fields
of
our
agriculturists
were
stricken
with
barrenness
and
they
are
reduced
like
famished
wolves
to
prowl
through
the
forsaken
woods
in
quest
of
prey
their
instinctive
love
of
their
country
attaches
them
to
the
soil
which
gave
them
birth
even
after
it
has
ceased
to
yield
anything
but
misery
and
death
at
length
they
are
compelled
to
acquiesce
and
to
depart
they
follow
the
traces
of
the
elk
the
buffalo
and
the
beaver
and
are
guided
by
those
wild
animals
in
the
choice
of
their
future
country
properly
speaking
therefore
it
is
not
the
europeans
who
drive
away
the
native
inhabitants
of
america
it
is
famine
which
compels
them
to
recede
a
happy
distinction
which
had
escaped
the
casuists
of
former
times
and
for
which
we
are
indebted
to
modern
discovery
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
the
extent
of
the
sufferings
which
attend
these
forced
emigrations
they
are
undertaken
by
a
people
already
exhausted
and
reduced
and
the
countries
to
which
the
betake
themselves
are
inhabited
by
other
tribes
which
receive
them
with
jealous
hostility
hunger
is
in
the
rear
war
awaits
them
and
misery
besets
them
on
all
sides
in
the
hope
of
escaping
from
such
a
host
of
enemies
they
separate
and
each
individual
endeavors
to
procure
the
means
of
supporting
his
existence
in
solitude
and
secrecy
living
in
the
immensity
of
the
desert
like
an
outcast
in
civilized
society
the
social
tie
which
distress
had
long
since
weakened
is
then
dissolved
they
have
lost
their
country
and
their
people
soon
deserts
them
their
very
families
are
obliterated
the
names
they
bore
in
common
are
forgotten
their
language
perishes
and
all
the
traces
of
their
origin
disappear
their
nation
has
ceased
to
exist
except
in
the
recollection
of
the
antiquaries
of
america
and
a
few
of
the
learned
of
europe
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
my
reader
suppose
that
i
am
coloring
the
picture
too
highly
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
several
of
the
cases
of
misery
which
i
have
been
describing
and
i
was
the
witness
of
sufferings
which
i
have
not
the
power
to
portray
at
the
end
of
the
year
while
i
was
on
the
left
bank
of
the
mississippi
at
a
place
named
by
europeans
memphis
there
arrived
a
numerous
band
of
choctaws
or
chactas
as
they
are
called
by
the
french
in
louisiana
these
savages
had
left
their
country
and
were
endeavoring
to
gain
the
right
bank
of
the
mississippi
where
they
hoped
to
find
an
asylum
which
had
been
promised
them
by
the
american
government
it
was
then
in
the
middle
of
winter
and
the
cold
was
unusually
severe
the
snow
had
frozen
hard
upon
the
ground
and
the
river
was
drifting
huge
masses
of
ice
the
indians
had
their
families
with
them
and
they
brought
in
their
train
the
wounded
and
the
sick
with
children
newly
born
and
old
men
upon
the
verge
of
death
they
possessed
neither
tents
nor
wagons
but
only
their
arms
and
some
provisions
i
saw
them
embark
to
pass
the
mighty
river
and
never
will
that
solemn
spectacle
fade
from
my
remembrance
no
cry
no
sob
was
heard
among
the
assembled
crowd
all
were
silent
their
calamities
were
of
ancient
date
and
they
knew
them
to
be
irremediable
the
indians
had
all
stepped
into
the
bark
which
was
to
carry
them
across
but
their
dogs
remained
upon
the
bank
as
soon
as
these
animals
perceived
that
their
masters
were
finally
leaving
the
shore
they
set
up
a
dismal
howl
and
plunging
all
together
into
the
icy
waters
of
the
mississippi
they
swam
after
the
boat
the
ejectment
of
the
indians
very
often
takes
place
at
the
present
day
in
a
regular
and
as
it
were
a
legal
manner
when
the
european
population
begins
to
approach
the
limit
of
the
desert
inhabited
by
a
savage
tribe
the
government
of
the
united
states
usually
despatches
envoys
to
them
who
assemble
the
indians
in
a
large
plain
and
having
first
eaten
and
drunk
with
them
accost
them
in
the
following
manner
what
have
you
to
do
in
the
land
of
your
fathers
before
long
you
must
dig
up
their
bones
in
order
to
live
in
what
respect
is
the
country
you
inhabit
better
than
another
are
there
no
woods
marshes
or
prairies
except
where
you
dwell
and
can
you
live
nowhere
but
under
your
own
sun
beyond
those
mountains
which
you
see
at
the
horizon
beyond
the
lake
which
bounds
your
territory
on
the
west
there
lie
vast
countries
where
beasts
of
chase
are
found
in
great
abundance
sell
your
land
to
us
and
go
to
live
happily
in
those
solitudes
after
holding
this
language
they
spread
before
the
eyes
of
the
indians
woollen
garments
kegs
of
brandy
glass
necklaces
bracelets
of
tinsel
and
if
when
they
have
beheld
all
these
riches
they
still
hesitate
it
is
insinuated
that
they
have
not
the
means
of
refusing
their
required
consent
and
that
the
government
itself
will
not
long
have
the
power
of
protecting
them
in
their
rights
what
are
they
to
do
half
convinced
and
half
compelled
they
go
to
inhabit
new
deserts
where
the
importunate
whites
will
not
let
them
remain
ten
years
in
tranquillity
in
this
manner
do
the
americans
obtain
at
a
very
low
price
whole
provinces
which
the
richest
sovereigns
of
europe
could
not
purchase
these
are
great
evils
and
it
must
be
added
that
they
appear
to
me
to
be
irremediable
i
believe
that
the
indian
nations
of
north
america
are
doomed
to
perish
and
that
whenever
the
europeans
shall
be
established
on
the
shores
of
the
pacific
ocean
that
race
of
men
will
be
no
more
the
indians
had
only
the
two
alternatives
of
war
or
civilization
in
other
words
they
must
either
have
destroyed
the
europeans
or
become
their
equals
at
the
first
settlement
of
the
colonies
they
might
have
found
it
possible
by
uniting
their
forces
to
deliver
themselves
from
the
small
bodies
of
strangers
who
landed
on
their
continent
they
several
times
attempted
to
do
it
and
were
on
the
point
of
succeeding
but
the
disproportion
of
their
resources
at
the
present
day
when
compared
with
those
of
the
whites
is
too
great
to
allow
such
an
enterprise
to
be
thought
of
nevertheless
there
do
arise
from
time
to
time
among
the
indians
men
of
penetration
who
foresee
the
final
destiny
which
awaits
the
native
population
and
who
exert
themselves
to
unite
all
the
tribes
in
common
hostility
to
the
europeans
but
their
efforts
are
unavailing
those
tribes
which
are
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
whites
are
too
much
weakened
to
offer
an
effectual
resistance
while
the
others
giving
way
to
that
childish
carelessness
of
the
morrow
which
characterizes
savage
life
wait
for
the
near
approach
of
danger
before
they
prepare
to
meet
it
some
are
unable
the
others
are
unwilling
to
exert
themselves
it
is
easy
to
foresee
that
the
indians
will
never
conform
to
civilisation
or
that
it
will
be
too
late
whenever
they
may
be
inclined
to
make
the
experiment
civilisation
is
the
result
of
long
social
process
which
takes
place
in
the
same
spot
and
is
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
each
one
profiting
by
the
experience
of
the
last
of
all
nations
those
submit
to
civilisation
with
the
most
difficulty
which
habitually
live
by
the
chase
pastoral
tribes
indeed
often
change
their
place
of
abode
but
they
follow
in
regular
order
in
their
migrations
and
often
return
again
to
their
old
stations
while
the
dwelling
of
the
hunter
varies
with
that
of
the
animals
he
pursues
several
attempts
have
been
made
to
diffuse
knowledge
among
the
indians
without
controlling
their
wandering
propensities
by
the
jesuits
in
canada
and
by
the
puritans
in
new
england
but
none
of
these
endeavors
were
crowned
by
any
lasting
success
civilisation
began
in
the
cabin
but
it
soon
retired
to
expire
in
the
woods
the
great
error
of
these
legislators
of
the
indians
was
their
not
understanding
that
in
order
to
succeed
in
civilizing
a
people
it
is
first
necessary
to
fix
it
which
can
not
be
done
without
inducing
it
to
cultivate
the
soil
the
indians
ought
in
the
first
place
to
have
been
accustomed
to
agriculture
but
not
only
are
they
destitute
of
this
indispensable
preliminary
to
civilisation
they
would
even
have
great
difficulty
in
acquiring
it
men
who
have
once
abandoned
themselves
to
the
restless
and
adventurous
life
of
the
hunter
feel
an
insurmountable
disgust
for
the
constant
and
regular
labor
which
tillage
requires
we
see
this
proved
in
the
bosom
of
our
own
society
but
it
is
far
more
visible
among
peoples
whose
partiality
for
the
chase
is
a
part
of
their
natural
character
independently
of
this
general
difficulty
there
is
another
which
applies
peculiarly
to
the
indians
they
consider
labor
not
merely
as
an
evil
but
as
a
disgrace
so
that
their
pride
prevents
them
from
becoming
civilized
as
much
as
their
indolence
there
is
no
indian
so
wretched
as
not
to
retain
under
his
hut
of
bark
a
lofty
idea
of
his
personal
worth
he
considers
the
cares
of
industry
and
labor
as
degrading
occupations
he
compares
the
husbandman
to
the
ox
which
traces
the
furrow
and
even
in
our
most
ingenious
handicraft
he
can
see
nothing
but
the
labor
of
slaves
not
that
he
is
devoid
of
admiration
for
the
power
and
intellectual
greatness
of
the
whites
but
although
the
result
of
our
efforts
surprises
him
he
contemns
the
means
by
which
we
obtain
it
and
while
he
acknowledges
our
ascendency
he
still
believes
in
his
superiority
war
and
hunting
are
the
only
pursuits
which
appear
to
him
worthy
to
be
the
occupations
of
a
man
the
indian
in
the
dreary
solitude
of
his
woods
cherishes
the
same
ideas
the
same
opinions
as
the
noble
of
the
middle
ages
in
his
castle
and
he
only
requires
to
become
a
conqueror
to
complete
the
resemblance
thus
however
strange
it
may
seem
it
is
in
the
forests
of
the
new
world
and
not
among
the
europeans
who
people
its
coasts
that
the
ancient
prejudices
of
europe
are
still
in
existence
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
this
work
i
have
endeavored
to
explain
the
prodigious
influence
which
the
social
condition
appears
to
exercise
upon
the
laws
and
the
manners
of
men
and
i
beg
to
add
a
few
words
on
the
same
subject
when
i
perceive
the
resemblance
which
exists
between
the
political
institutions
of
our
ancestors
the
germans
and
of
the
wandering
tribes
of
north
america
between
the
customs
described
by
tacitus
and
those
of
which
i
have
sometimes
been
a
witness
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
same
cause
has
brought
about
the
same
results
in
both
hemispheres
and
that
in
the
midst
of
the
apparent
diversity
of
human
affairs
a
certain
number
of
primary
facts
may
be
discovered
from
which
all
the
others
are
derived
in
what
we
usually
call
the
german
institutions
then
i
am
inclined
only
to
perceive
barbarian
habits
and
the
opinions
of
savages
in
what
we
style
feudal
principles
however
strongly
the
vices
and
prejudices
of
the
north
american
indians
may
be
opposed
to
their
becoming
agricultural
and
civilized
necessity
sometimes
obliges
them
to
it
several
of
the
southern
nations
and
among
them
the
cherokees
and
the
creeks
were
surrounded
by
europeans
who
had
landed
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
who
either
descending
the
ohio
or
proceeding
up
the
mississippi
arrived
simultaneously
upon
their
borders
these
tribes
have
not
been
driven
from
place
to
place
like
their
northern
brethren
but
they
have
been
gradually
enclosed
within
narrow
limits
like
the
game
within
the
thicket
before
the
huntsmen
plunge
into
the
interior
the
indians
who
were
thus
placed
between
civilisation
and
death
found
themselves
obliged
to
live
by
ignominious
labor
like
the
whites
they
took
to
agriculture
and
without
entirely
forsaking
their
old
habits
or
manners
sacrificed
only
as
much
as
was
necessary
to
their
existence
the
cherokees
went
further
they
created
a
written
language
established
a
permanent
form
of
government
and
as
everything
proceeds
rapidly
in
the
new
world
before
they
had
all
of
them
clothes
they
set
up
a
newspaper
the
growth
of
european
habits
has
been
remarkably
accelerated
among
these
indians
by
the
mixed
race
which
has
sprung
up
deriving
intelligence
from
the
father
side
without
entirely
losing
the
savage
customs
of
the
mother
the
forms
the
natural
link
between
civilisation
and
barbarism
wherever
this
race
has
multiplied
the
savage
state
has
become
modified
and
a
great
change
has
taken
place
in
the
manners
of
the
people
the
success
of
the
cherokees
proves
that
the
indians
are
capable
of
civilisation
but
it
does
not
prove
that
they
will
succeed
in
it
the
difficulty
which
the
indians
find
in
submitting
to
civilisation
proceeds
from
the
influence
of
a
general
cause
which
it
is
almost
impossible
for
them
to
escape
an
attentive
survey
of
history
demonstrates
that
in
general
barbarous
nations
have
raised
themselves
to
civilisation
by
degrees
and
by
their
own
efforts
whenever
they
derived
knowledge
from
a
foreign
people
they
stood
toward
it
in
the
relation
of
conquerors
not
of
a
conquered
nation
when
the
conquered
nation
is
enlightened
and
the
conquerors
are
half
savage
as
in
the
case
of
the
invasion
of
rome
by
the
northern
nations
or
that
of
china
by
the
moguls
the
power
which
victory
bestows
upon
the
barbarian
is
sufficient
to
keep
up
his
importance
among
civilized
men
and
permit
him
to
rank
as
their
equal
until
he
becomes
their
rival
the
one
has
might
on
his
side
the
other
has
intelligence
the
former
admires
the
knowledge
and
the
arts
of
the
conquered
the
latter
envies
the
power
of
the
conquerors
the
barbarians
at
length
admit
civilized
man
into
their
palaces
and
he
in
turn
opens
his
schools
to
the
barbarians
but
when
the
side
on
which
the
physical
force
lies
also
possesses
an
intellectual
preponderance
the
conquered
party
seldom
becomes
civilized
it
retreats
or
is
destroyed
it
may
therefore
be
said
in
a
general
way
that
savages
go
forth
in
arms
to
seek
knowledge
but
that
they
do
not
receive
it
when
it
comes
to
them
if
the
indian
tribes
which
now
inhabit
the
heart
of
the
continent
could
summon
up
energy
enough
to
attempt
to
civilize
themselves
they
might
possibly
succeed
superior
already
to
the
barbarous
nations
which
surround
them
they
would
gradually
gain
strength
and
experience
and
when
the
europeans
should
appear
upon
their
borders
they
would
be
in
a
state
if
not
to
maintain
their
independence
at
least
to
assert
their
right
to
the
soil
and
to
incorporate
themselves
with
the
conquerors
but
it
is
the
misfortune
of
indians
to
be
brought
into
contact
with
a
civilized
people
which
is
also
it
may
be
owned
the
most
avaricious
nation
on
the
globe
while
they
are
still
to
find
despots
in
their
instructors
and
to
receive
knowledge
from
the
hand
of
oppression
living
in
the
freedom
of
the
woods
the
north
american
indian
was
destitute
but
he
had
no
feeling
of
inferiority
toward
any
one
as
soon
however
as
he
desires
to
penetrate
into
the
social
scale
of
the
whites
he
takes
the
lowest
rank
in
society
for
he
enters
ignorant
and
poor
within
the
pale
of
science
and
wealth
after
having
led
a
life
of
agitation
beset
with
evils
and
dangers
but
at
the
same
time
filled
with
proud
emotions
he
is
obliged
to
submit
to
a
wearisome
obscure
and
degraded
state
and
to
gain
the
bread
which
nourishes
him
by
hard
and
ignoble
labor
such
are
in
his
eyes
the
only
results
of
which
civilisation
can
boast
and
even
this
much
he
is
not
sure
to
obtain
when
the
indians
undertake
to
imitate
their
european
neighbors
and
to
till
the
earth
like
the
settlers
they
are
immediately
exposed
to
a
very
formidable
competition
the
white
man
is
skilled
in
the
craft
of
agriculture
the
indian
is
a
rough
beginner
in
an
art
with
which
he
is
unacquainted
the
former
reaps
abundant
crops
without
difficulty
the
latter
meets
with
a
thousand
obstacles
in
raising
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
european
is
placed
among
a
population
whose
wants
he
knows
and
partakes
the
savage
is
isolated
in
the
midst
of
a
hostile
people
with
whose
manners
language
and
laws
he
is
imperfectly
acquainted
but
without
whose
assistance
he
can
not
live
he
can
only
procure
the
materials
of
comfort
by
bartering
his
commodities
against
the
goods
of
the
european
for
the
assistance
of
his
countrymen
is
wholly
insufficient
to
supply
his
wants
when
the
indian
wishes
to
sell
the
produce
of
his
labor
he
can
not
always
meet
with
a
purchaser
while
the
european
readily
finds
a
market
and
the
former
can
only
produce
at
a
considerable
cost
that
which
the
latter
vends
at
a
very
low
rate
thus
the
indian
has
no
sooner
escaped
those
evils
to
which
barbarous
nations
are
exposed
than
he
is
subjected
to
the
still
greater
miseries
of
civilized
communities
and
he
finds
it
scarcely
less
difficult
to
live
in
the
midst
of
our
abundance
than
in
the
depth
of
his
own
wilderness
he
has
not
yet
lost
the
habits
of
his
erratic
life
the
traditions
of
his
fathers
and
his
passion
for
the
chase
are
still
alive
within
him
the
wild
enjoyments
which
formerly
animated
him
in
the
woods
painfully
excite
his
troubled
imagination
and
his
former
privations
appear
to
be
less
keen
his
former
perils
less
appalling
he
contrasts
the
independence
which
he
possessed
among
his
equals
with
the
servile
position
which
he
occupies
in
civilized
society
on
the
other
hand
the
solitudes
which
were
so
long
his
free
home
are
still
at
hand
a
few
hours
march
will
bring
him
back
to
them
once
more
the
whites
offer
him
a
sum
which
seems
to
him
to
be
considerable
for
the
ground
which
he
has
begun
to
clear
this
money
of
the
europeans
may
possibly
furnish
him
with
the
means
of
a
happy
and
peaceful
subsistence
in
remote
regions
and
he
quits
the
plough
resumes
his
native
arms
and
returns
to
the
wilderness
for
ever
the
condition
of
the
creeks
and
cherokees
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
sufficiently
corroborates
the
truth
of
this
deplorable
picture
the
indians
in
the
little
which
they
have
done
have
unquestionably
displayed
as
much
natural
genius
as
the
peoples
of
europe
in
their
most
important
designs
but
nations
as
well
as
men
require
time
to
learn
whatever
may
be
their
intelligence
and
their
zeal
while
the
savages
were
engaged
in
the
work
of
civilisation
the
europeans
continued
to
surround
them
on
every
side
and
to
confine
them
within
narrower
limits
the
two
races
gradually
met
and
they
are
now
in
immediate
juxtaposition
to
each
other
the
indian
is
already
superior
to
his
barbarous
parent
but
he
is
still
very
far
below
his
white
neighbor
with
their
resources
and
acquired
knowledge
the
europeans
soon
appropriated
to
themselves
most
of
the
advantages
which
the
natives
might
have
derived
from
the
possession
of
the
soil
they
have
settled
in
the
country
they
have
purchased
land
at
a
very
low
rate
or
have
occupied
it
by
force
and
the
indians
have
been
ruined
by
a
competition
which
they
had
not
the
means
of
resisting
they
were
isolated
in
their
own
country
and
their
race
only
constituted
a
colony
of
troublesome
aliens
in
the
midst
of
a
numerous
and
domineering
people
washington
said
in
one
of
his
messages
to
congress
we
are
more
enlightened
and
powerful
than
the
indian
nations
we
are
therefore
bound
in
honor
to
treat
them
with
kindness
and
even
with
generosity
but
this
virtuous
and
policy
has
not
been
followed
the
rapacity
of
the
settlers
is
usually
backed
by
the
tyranny
of
the
government
although
the
cherokees
and
the
creeks
are
established
upon
the
territory
which
they
inhabited
before
the
settlement
of
the
europeans
and
although
the
americans
have
frequently
treated
with
them
as
with
foreign
nations
the
surrounding
states
have
not
consented
to
acknowledge
them
as
an
independent
people
and
attempts
have
been
made
to
subject
these
children
of
the
woods
to
magistrates
laws
and
customs
destitution
had
driven
these
unfortunate
indians
to
civilisation
and
oppression
now
drives
them
back
to
their
former
condition
many
of
them
abandon
the
soil
which
they
had
begun
to
clear
and
return
to
their
savage
course
of
life
if
we
consider
the
tyrannical
measures
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
legislatures
of
the
southern
states
the
conduct
of
their
governors
and
the
decrees
of
their
courts
of
justice
we
shall
be
convinced
that
the
entire
expulsion
of
the
indians
is
the
final
result
to
which
the
efforts
of
their
policy
are
directed
the
americans
of
that
part
of
the
union
look
with
jealousy
upon
the
aborigines
they
are
aware
that
these
tribes
have
not
yet
lost
the
traditions
of
savage
life
and
before
civilisation
has
permanently
fixed
them
to
the
soil
it
is
intended
to
force
them
to
recede
by
reducing
them
to
despair
the
creeks
and
cherokees
oppressed
by
the
several
states
have
appealed
to
the
central
government
which
is
by
no
means
insensible
to
their
misfortunes
and
is
sincerely
desirous
of
saving
the
remnant
of
the
natives
and
of
maintaining
them
in
the
free
possession
of
that
territory
which
the
union
is
pledged
to
respect
but
the
several
states
oppose
so
formidable
a
resistance
to
the
execution
of
this
design
that
the
government
is
obliged
to
consent
to
the
extirpation
of
a
few
barbarous
tribes
in
order
not
to
endanger
the
safety
of
the
american
union
but
the
federal
government
which
is
not
able
to
protect
the
indians
would
fain
mitigate
the
hardships
of
their
lot
and
with
this
intention
proposals
have
been
made
to
transport
them
into
more
remote
regions
at
the
public
cost
between
the
and
degrees
of
north
latitude
a
vast
tract
of
country
lies
which
has
taken
the
name
of
arkansas
from
the
principal
river
that
waters
its
extent
it
is
bounded
on
the
one
side
by
the
confines
of
mexico
on
the
other
by
the
mississippi
numberless
streams
cross
it
in
every
direction
the
climate
is
mild
and
the
soil
productive
but
it
is
only
inhabited
by
a
few
wandering
hordes
of
savages
the
government
of
the
union
wishes
to
transport
the
broken
remnants
of
the
indigenous
population
of
the
south
to
the
portion
of
this
country
which
is
nearest
to
mexico
and
at
a
great
distance
from
the
american
settlements
we
were
assured
toward
the
end
of
the
year
that
indians
had
already
gone
to
the
shores
of
the
arkansas
and
fresh
detachments
were
constantly
following
them
but
congress
has
been
unable
to
excite
a
unanimous
determination
in
those
whom
it
is
disposed
to
protect
some
indeed
are
willing
to
quit
the
seat
of
oppression
but
the
most
enlightened
members
of
the
community
refuse
to
abandon
their
recent
dwellings
and
the
springing
crops
they
are
of
opinion
that
the
work
of
civilisation
once
interrupted
will
never
be
resumed
they
fear
that
those
domestic
habits
which
have
been
so
recently
contracted
may
be
irrecoverably
lost
in
the
midst
of
a
country
which
is
still
barbarous
and
where
nothing
is
prepared
for
the
subsistence
of
an
agricultural
people
they
know
that
their
entrance
into
those
wilds
will
be
opposed
by
inimical
hordes
and
that
they
have
lost
the
energy
of
barbarians
without
acquiring
the
resources
of
civilisation
to
resist
their
attacks
moreover
the
indians
readily
discover
that
the
settlement
which
is
proposed
to
them
is
merely
a
temporary
expedient
who
can
assure
them
that
they
will
at
length
be
allowed
to
dwell
in
peace
in
their
new
retreat
the
united
states
pledge
themselves
to
the
observance
of
the
obligation
but
the
territory
which
they
at
present
occupy
was
formerly
secured
to
them
by
the
most
solemn
oaths
of
faith
the
american
government
does
not
indeed
rob
them
of
their
lands
but
it
allows
perpetual
incursions
to
be
made
on
them
in
a
few
years
the
same
white
population
which
now
flocks
around
them
will
track
them
to
the
solitudes
of
the
arkansas
they
will
then
be
exposed
to
the
same
evils
without
the
same
remedies
and
as
the
limits
of
the
earth
will
at
last
fail
them
their
only
refuge
is
the
grave
the
union
treats
the
indians
with
less
cupidity
and
rigor
than
the
policy
of
the
several
states
but
the
two
governments
are
alike
destitute
of
good
faith
the
states
extend
what
they
are
pleased
to
term
the
benefits
of
their
laws
to
the
indians
with
a
belief
that
the
tribes
will
recede
rather
than
submit
and
the
central
government
which
promises
a
permanent
refuge
to
these
unhappy
beings
is
well
aware
of
its
inability
to
secure
it
to
them
thus
the
tyranny
of
the
states
obliges
the
savages
to
retire
the
union
by
its
promises
and
resources
facilitates
their
retreat
and
these
measures
tend
to
precisely
the
same
end
by
the
will
of
our
father
in
heaven
the
governor
of
the
whole
world
said
the
cherokees
in
their
petition
to
congress
the
red
man
of
america
has
become
small
and
the
white
man
great
and
renowned
when
the
ancestors
of
the
people
of
these
united
states
first
came
to
the
shores
of
america
they
found
the
red
man
strong
though
he
was
ignorant
and
savage
yet
he
received
them
kindly
and
gave
them
dry
land
to
rest
their
weary
feet
they
met
in
peace
and
shook
hands
in
token
of
friendship
whatever
the
white
man
wanted
and
asked
of
the
indian
the
latter
willingly
gave
at
that
time
the
indian
was
the
lord
and
the
white
man
the
suppliant
but
now
the
scene
has
changed
the
strength
of
the
red
man
has
become
weakness
as
his
neighbors
increased
in
numbers
his
power
became
less
and
less
and
now
of
the
many
and
powerful
tribes
who
once
covered
the
united
states
only
a
few
are
to
be
seen
a
few
whom
a
sweeping
pestilence
had
left
the
northern
tribes
who
were
once
so
numerous
and
powerful
are
now
nearly
extinct
thus
it
has
happened
to
the
red
man
of
america
shall
we
who
are
remnants
share
the
same
fate
the
land
on
which
we
stand
we
have
received
as
an
inheritance
from
our
fathers
who
possessed
it
from
time
immemorial
as
a
gift
from
our
common
father
in
heaven
they
bequeathed
it
to
us
as
their
children
and
we
have
sacredly
kept
it
as
containing
their
remains
this
right
of
inheritance
we
have
never
ceded
nor
ever
forfeited
permit
us
to
ask
what
better
right
can
the
people
have
to
a
country
than
the
right
of
inheritance
and
immemorial
peaceable
possession
we
know
it
is
said
of
late
by
the
state
of
georgia
and
by
the
executive
of
the
united
states
that
we
have
forfeited
this
right
but
we
think
it
is
said
gratuitously
at
what
time
have
we
made
the
forfeit
what
great
crime
have
we
committed
whereby
we
must
for
ever
be
divested
of
our
country
and
rights
was
it
when
we
were
hostile
to
the
united
states
and
took
part
with
the
king
of
great
britain
during
the
struggle
for
independence
if
so
why
was
not
this
forfeiture
declared
in
the
first
treaty
which
followed
that
war
why
was
not
such
an
article
as
the
following
inserted
in
the
treaty
united
states
give
peace
to
the
cherokees
but
for
the
part
they
took
in
the
last
war
declare
them
to
be
but
tenants
at
will
to
be
removed
when
the
convenience
of
the
states
within
whose
chartered
limits
they
live
shall
require
it
that
was
the
proper
time
to
assume
such
a
possession
but
it
was
not
thought
of
nor
would
our
forefathers
have
agreed
to
any
treaty
whose
tendency
was
to
deprive
them
of
their
rights
and
their
country
such
is
the
language
of
the
indians
their
assertions
are
true
their
forebodings
inevitable
from
whichever
side
we
consider
the
destinies
of
the
aborigines
of
north
america
their
calamities
appear
to
be
irremediable
if
they
continue
barbarous
they
are
forced
to
retire
if
they
attempt
to
civilize
their
manners
the
contact
of
a
more
civilized
community
subjects
them
to
oppression
and
destitution
they
perish
if
they
continue
to
wander
from
waste
to
waste
and
if
they
attempt
to
settle
they
still
must
perish
the
assistance
of
europeans
is
necessary
to
instruct
them
but
the
approach
of
europeans
corrupts
and
repels
them
into
savage
life
they
refuse
to
change
their
habits
as
long
as
their
solitudes
are
their
own
and
it
is
too
late
to
change
them
when
they
are
constrained
to
submit
the
spaniards
pursued
the
indians
with
like
wild
beasts
and
they
sacked
the
new
world
with
no
more
temper
or
compassion
than
a
city
taken
by
storm
but
destruction
must
cease
and
phrensy
be
stayed
the
remnant
of
the
indian
population
which
had
escaped
the
massacre
mixed
with
its
conquerors
and
adopted
their
religion
and
manners
the
conduct
of
the
americans
of
the
united
states
towards
the
aborigines
is
characterized
on
the
other
hand
by
a
singular
attachment
to
the
formalities
of
law
provided
that
the
indians
retain
their
barbarous
condition
the
americans
take
no
part
in
their
affairs
they
treat
them
as
independent
nations
and
do
not
possess
themselves
of
their
hunting
grounds
without
a
treaty
of
purchase
and
if
an
indian
nation
happens
to
be
so
encroached
upon
as
to
be
unable
to
subsist
upon
its
territory
they
afford
it
brotherly
assistance
in
transporting
it
to
a
grave
sufficiently
remote
from
the
land
of
its
fathers
the
spaniards
were
unable
to
exterminate
the
indian
race
by
those
unparalleled
atrocities
which
brand
them
with
indelible
shame
nor
did
they
even
succeed
in
wholly
depriving
it
of
its
rights
but
the
americans
of
the
united
states
have
accomplished
this
twofold
purpose
with
singular
felicity
tranquilly
legally
philanthropically
without
shedding
blood
and
without
violating
a
single
great
principle
of
morality
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
it
is
impossible
to
destroy
men
with
more
respect
for
the
laws
of
humanity
situation
of
the
black
population
in
the
united
states
and
dangers
with
which
its
presence
threatens
the
whites
why
it
is
more
difficult
to
abolish
slavery
and
to
efface
all
vestiges
of
it
among
the
moderns
than
it
was
among
the
in
the
united
states
the
prejudices
of
the
whites
against
the
blacks
seem
to
increase
in
proportion
as
slavery
is
situation
of
the
negroes
in
the
northern
and
southern
why
the
americans
abolish
servitude
which
debases
the
slave
impoverishes
the
contrast
between
the
left
and
the
right
bank
of
the
to
what
the
black
race
as
well
as
slavery
recedes
toward
the
explanation
of
this
difficulties
attendant
upon
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
dangers
to
general
foundation
of
a
black
colony
in
why
the
americans
of
the
south
increase
the
hardships
of
slavery
while
they
are
distressed
at
its
continuance
the
indians
will
perish
in
the
same
isolated
condition
in
which
they
have
lived
but
the
destiny
of
the
negroes
is
in
some
measure
interwoven
with
that
of
the
europeans
these
two
races
are
attached
to
each
other
without
intermingling
and
they
are
alike
unable
entirely
to
separate
or
to
combine
the
most
formidable
of
all
the
ills
which
threaten
the
future
existence
of
the
united
states
arises
from
the
presence
of
a
black
population
upon
its
territory
and
in
contemplating
the
causes
of
the
present
embarrassments
or
of
the
future
dangers
of
the
united
states
the
observer
is
invariably
led
to
consider
this
as
a
primary
fact
the
permanent
evils
to
which
mankind
is
subjected
are
usually
produced
by
the
vehement
or
the
increasing
efforts
of
men
but
there
is
one
calamity
which
penetrated
furtively
into
the
world
and
which
was
at
first
scarcely
distinguishable
amid
the
ordinary
abuses
of
power
it
originated
with
an
individual
whose
name
history
has
not
preserved
it
was
wafted
like
some
accursed
germ
upon
a
portion
of
the
soil
but
it
afterward
nurtured
itself
grew
without
effort
and
spreads
naturally
with
the
society
to
which
it
belongs
i
need
scarcely
add
that
this
calamity
is
slavery
christianity
suppressed
slavery
but
the
christians
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
as
an
exception
indeed
to
their
social
system
and
restricted
to
one
of
the
races
of
mankind
but
the
wound
thus
inflicted
upon
humanity
though
less
extensive
was
at
the
same
time
rendered
far
more
difficult
of
cure
it
is
important
to
make
an
accurate
distinction
between
slavery
itself
and
its
consequences
the
immediate
evils
which
are
produced
by
slavery
were
very
nearly
the
same
in
antiquity
as
they
are
among
the
moderns
but
the
consequences
of
these
evils
were
different
the
slave
among
the
ancients
belonged
to
the
same
race
as
his
master
and
he
was
often
the
superior
of
the
two
in
education
and
instruction
freedom
was
the
only
distinction
between
them
and
when
freedom
was
conferred
they
were
easily
confounded
together
the
ancients
then
had
a
very
simple
means
of
avoiding
slavery
and
its
evil
consequences
which
was
that
of
enfranchisement
and
they
succeeded
as
soon
as
they
adopted
this
measure
generally
not
but
in
ancient
states
the
vestiges
of
servitude
subsisted
for
some
time
after
servitude
was
abolished
there
is
a
natural
prejudice
which
prompts
men
to
despise
whomsoever
has
been
their
inferior
long
after
he
has
become
their
equal
and
the
real
inequality
which
is
produced
by
fortune
or
by
law
is
always
succeeded
by
an
imaginary
inequality
which
is
implanted
in
the
manners
of
the
people
nevertheless
this
secondary
consequence
of
slavery
was
limited
to
a
certain
term
among
the
ancients
for
the
freedman
bore
so
entire
a
resemblance
to
those
born
free
that
it
soon
became
impossible
to
distinguish
him
from
among
them
the
greatest
difficulty
in
antiquity
was
that
of
altering
the
law
among
the
moderns
it
is
of
altering
the
manners
and
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
real
obstacles
begin
where
those
of
the
ancients
left
off
this
arises
from
the
circumstance
that
among
the
moderns
the
abstract
and
transient
fact
of
slavery
is
fatally
united
to
the
physical
and
permanent
fact
of
color
the
tradition
of
slavery
dishonors
the
race
and
the
peculiarity
of
the
race
perpetuates
the
tradition
of
slavery
no
african
has
ever
voluntarily
emigrated
to
the
shores
of
the
new
world
whence
it
must
be
inferred
that
all
the
blacks
who
are
now
to
be
found
in
that
hemisphere
are
either
slaves
or
freedmen
thus
the
negro
transmits
the
eternal
mark
of
his
ignominy
to
all
his
descendants
and
although
the
law
may
abolish
slavery
god
alone
can
obliterate
the
traces
of
its
existence
the
modern
slave
differs
from
his
master
not
only
in
his
condition
but
in
his
origin
you
may
set
the
negro
free
but
you
can
not
make
him
otherwise
than
an
alien
to
the
european
nor
is
this
all
we
scarcely
acknowledge
the
common
features
of
mankind
in
this
child
of
debasement
whom
slavery
has
brought
among
us
his
physiognomy
is
to
our
eyes
hideous
his
understanding
weak
his
tastes
low
and
we
are
almost
inclined
to
look
upon
him
as
a
being
intermediate
between
man
and
the
brutes
the
moderns
then
after
they
have
abolished
slavery
have
three
prejudices
to
contend
against
which
are
less
easy
to
attack
and
far
less
easy
to
conquer
than
the
mere
fact
of
servitude
the
prejudice
of
the
master
the
prejudice
of
the
race
and
the
prejudice
of
color
it
is
difficult
for
us
who
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
born
among
men
like
ourselves
by
nature
and
equal
to
ourselves
by
law
to
conceive
the
irreconcilable
differences
which
separate
the
negro
from
the
european
in
america
but
we
may
derive
some
faint
notion
of
them
from
analogy
france
was
formerly
a
country
in
which
numerous
distinctions
of
rank
existed
that
had
been
created
by
the
legislation
nothing
can
be
more
fictitious
than
a
purely
legal
inferiority
nothing
more
contrary
to
the
instinct
of
mankind
than
these
permanent
divisions
which
had
been
established
between
beings
evidently
similar
nevertheless
these
divisions
subsisted
for
ages
they
still
subsist
in
many
places
and
on
all
sides
they
have
left
imaginary
vestiges
which
time
alone
can
efface
if
it
be
so
difficult
to
root
out
an
inequality
which
solely
originates
in
the
law
how
are
those
distinctions
to
be
destroyed
which
seem
to
be
founded
upon
the
immutable
laws
of
nature
herself
when
i
remember
the
extreme
difficulty
with
which
aristocratic
bodies
of
whatever
nature
they
may
be
are
commingled
with
the
mass
of
the
people
and
the
exceeding
care
which
they
take
to
preserve
the
ideal
boundaries
of
their
caste
inviolate
i
despair
of
seeing
an
aristocracy
disappear
which
is
founded
upon
visible
and
indelible
signs
those
who
hope
that
the
europeans
will
ever
mix
with
the
negroes
appear
to
me
to
delude
themselves
and
i
am
not
led
to
any
such
conclusion
by
my
own
reason
or
by
the
evidence
of
facts
hitherto
wherever
the
whites
have
been
the
most
powerful
they
have
maintained
the
blacks
in
a
subordinate
or
a
servile
position
wherever
the
negroes
have
been
strongest
they
have
destroyed
the
whites
such
has
been
the
only
course
of
events
which
has
ever
taken
place
between
the
two
races
i
see
that
in
a
certain
portion
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states
at
the
present
day
the
legal
barrier
which
separated
the
two
races
is
tending
to
fall
away
but
not
that
which
exists
in
the
manners
of
the
country
slavery
recedes
but
the
prejudice
to
which
it
has
given
birth
remains
stationary
whosoever
has
inhabited
the
united
states
must
have
perceived
that
in
those
parts
of
the
union
in
which
the
negroes
are
no
longer
slaves
they
have
in
nowise
drawn
nearer
to
the
whites
on
the
contrary
the
prejudice
of
the
race
appears
to
be
stronger
in
the
states
which
have
abolished
slavery
than
in
those
where
it
still
exists
and
nowhere
is
it
so
intolerant
as
in
those
states
where
servitude
has
never
been
known
it
is
true
that
in
the
north
of
the
union
marriages
may
be
legally
contracted
between
negroes
and
whites
but
public
opinion
would
stigmatize
a
man
who
should
connect
himself
with
a
negress
as
infamous
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
meet
with
a
single
instance
of
such
a
union
the
electoral
franchise
has
been
conferred
upon
the
negroes
in
almost
all
the
states
in
which
slavery
has
been
abolished
but
if
they
come
forward
to
vote
their
lives
are
in
danger
if
oppressed
they
may
bring
an
action
at
law
but
they
will
find
none
but
whites
among
their
judges
and
although
they
may
legally
serve
as
jurors
prejudice
repulses
them
from
that
office
the
same
schools
do
not
receive
the
child
of
the
black
and
of
the
european
in
the
theatres
gold
can
not
procure
a
seat
for
the
servile
race
beside
their
former
masters
in
the
hospitals
they
lie
apart
and
although
they
are
allowed
to
invoke
the
same
divinity
as
the
whites
it
must
be
at
a
different
altar
and
in
their
own
churches
with
their
own
clergy
the
gates
of
heaven
are
not
closed
against
these
unhappy
beings
but
their
inferiority
is
continued
to
the
very
confines
of
the
other
world
when
the
negro
is
defunct
his
bones
are
cast
aside
and
the
distinction
of
condition
prevails
even
in
the
equality
of
death
the
negro
is
free
but
he
can
share
neither
the
rights
nor
the
pleasure
nor
the
labor
nor
the
afflictions
nor
the
tomb
of
him
whose
equal
he
has
been
declared
to
be
and
he
can
not
meet
him
upon
fair
terms
in
life
or
in
death
in
the
south
where
slavery
still
exists
the
negroes
are
less
carefully
kept
apart
they
sometimes
share
the
labor
and
the
recreations
of
the
whites
the
whites
consent
to
intermix
with
them
to
a
certain
extent
and
although
the
legislation
treats
them
more
harshly
the
habits
of
the
people
are
more
tolerant
and
compassionate
in
the
south
the
master
is
not
afraid
to
raise
his
slave
to
his
own
standing
because
he
knows
that
he
can
in
a
moment
reduce
him
to
the
dust
at
pleasure
in
the
north
the
white
no
longer
distinctly
perceives
the
barrier
which
separates
him
from
the
degraded
race
and
he
shuns
the
negro
with
the
more
pertinacity
because
he
fears
lest
they
should
be
some
day
confounded
together
among
the
americans
of
the
south
nature
sometimes
reasserts
her
rights
and
restores
a
transient
equality
between
the
blacks
and
the
whites
but
in
the
north
pride
restrains
the
most
imperious
of
human
passions
the
american
of
the
northern
states
would
perhaps
allow
the
negress
to
share
his
licentious
pleasures
if
the
laws
of
his
country
did
not
declare
that
she
may
aspire
to
be
the
legitimate
partner
of
his
bed
but
he
recoils
with
horror
from
her
who
might
become
his
wife
thus
it
is
in
the
united
states
that
the
prejudice
which
repels
the
negroes
seems
to
increase
in
proportion
as
they
are
emancipated
and
inequality
is
sanctioned
by
the
manners
while
it
is
effaced
from
the
laws
of
the
country
but
if
the
relative
position
of
the
two
races
which
inhabit
the
united
states
is
such
as
i
have
described
it
may
be
asked
why
the
americans
have
abolished
slavery
in
the
north
of
the
union
why
they
maintain
it
in
the
south
and
why
they
aggravate
its
hardships
there
the
answer
is
easily
given
it
is
not
for
the
good
of
the
negroes
but
for
that
of
the
whites
that
measures
are
taken
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
united
states
the
first
negroes
were
imported
into
virginia
about
the
year
in
america
therefore
as
well
as
in
the
rest
of
the
globe
slavery
originated
in
the
south
thence
it
spread
from
one
settlement
to
another
but
the
number
of
slaves
diminished
toward
the
northern
states
and
the
negro
population
was
always
very
limited
in
new
england
a
century
had
scarcely
elapsed
since
the
foundation
of
the
colonies
when
the
attention
of
the
planters
was
struck
by
the
extraordinary
fact
that
the
provinces
which
were
comparatively
destitute
of
slaves
increased
in
population
in
wealth
and
in
prosperity
more
rapidly
than
those
which
contained
the
greatest
number
of
negroes
in
the
former
however
the
inhabitants
were
obliged
to
cultivate
the
soil
themselves
or
by
hired
laborers
in
the
latter
they
were
furnished
with
hands
for
which
they
paid
no
wages
yet
although
labor
and
expense
were
on
the
one
side
and
ease
with
economy
on
the
other
the
former
were
in
possession
of
the
most
advantageous
system
this
consequence
seemed
to
be
the
more
difficult
to
explain
since
the
settlers
who
all
belonged
to
the
same
european
race
had
the
same
habits
the
same
civilisation
the
same
laws
and
their
shades
of
difference
were
extremely
slight
time
however
continued
to
advance
and
the
anglo
americans
spreading
beyond
the
coasts
of
the
atlantic
ocean
penetrated
farther
and
farther
into
the
solitudes
of
the
west
they
met
with
a
new
soil
and
an
unwonted
climate
the
obstacles
which
opposed
them
were
of
the
most
various
character
their
races
intermingled
the
inhabitants
of
the
south
went
up
toward
the
north
those
of
the
north
descended
to
the
south
but
in
the
midst
of
all
these
causes
the
same
result
recurred
at
every
step
and
in
general
the
colonies
in
which
there
were
no
slaves
became
more
populous
and
more
rich
than
those
in
which
slavery
flourished
the
more
progress
was
made
the
more
was
it
shown
that
slavery
which
is
so
cruel
to
the
slave
is
prejudicial
to
the
master
but
this
truth
was
most
satisfactorily
demonstrated
when
civilisation
reached
the
banks
of
the
ohio
the
stream
which
the
indians
had
distinguished
by
the
name
of
ohio
or
beautiful
river
waters
one
of
the
most
magnificent
valleys
which
have
ever
been
made
the
abode
of
man
undulating
lands
extend
upon
both
shores
of
the
ohio
whose
soil
affords
inexhaustible
treasures
to
the
laborer
on
either
bank
the
air
is
wholesome
and
the
climate
mild
and
each
of
them
forms
the
extreme
frontier
of
a
vast
state
that
which
follows
the
numerous
windings
of
the
ohio
upon
the
left
is
called
kentucky
that
upon
the
right
bears
the
name
of
the
river
these
two
states
only
differ
in
a
single
respect
kentucky
has
admitted
slavery
but
the
state
of
ohio
has
prohibited
the
existence
of
slaves
within
its
borders
thus
the
traveller
who
floats
down
the
current
of
the
ohio
to
the
spot
where
that
river
falls
into
the
mississippi
may
be
said
to
sail
between
liberty
and
servitude
and
a
transient
inspection
of
the
surrounding
objects
will
convince
him
which
of
the
two
is
most
favorable
to
mankind
upon
the
left
bank
of
the
stream
the
population
is
rare
from
time
to
time
one
descries
a
troop
of
slaves
loitering
in
the
fields
the
primeval
forest
recurs
at
every
turn
society
seems
to
be
asleep
man
to
be
idle
and
nature
alone
offers
a
scene
of
activity
and
of
life
from
the
right
bank
on
the
contrary
a
confused
hum
is
heard
which
proclaims
the
presence
of
industry
the
fields
are
covered
with
abundant
harvests
the
elegance
of
the
dwellings
announces
the
taste
and
activity
of
the
laborer
and
man
appears
to
be
in
the
enjoyment
of
that
wealth
and
contentment
which
are
the
reward
of
labor
the
state
of
kentucky
was
founded
in
the
state
of
ohio
only
twelve
years
later
but
twelve
years
are
more
in
america
than
half
a
century
in
europe
and
at
the
present
day
the
population
of
ohio
exceeds
that
of
kentucky
by
souls
these
opposite
consequences
of
slavery
and
freedom
may
readily
be
understood
and
they
suffice
to
explain
many
of
the
differences
which
we
remark
between
the
civilisation
of
antiquity
and
that
of
our
own
time
upon
the
left
bank
of
the
ohio
labor
is
confounded
with
the
idea
of
slavery
upon
the
right
bank
it
is
identified
with
that
of
prosperity
and
improvement
on
the
one
side
it
is
degraded
on
the
other
it
is
honored
on
the
former
territory
no
white
laborers
can
be
found
for
they
would
be
afraid
of
assimilating
themselves
to
the
negroes
on
the
latter
no
one
is
idle
for
the
white
population
extends
its
activity
and
its
intelligence
to
every
kind
of
employment
thus
the
men
whose
task
it
is
to
cultivate
the
rich
soil
of
kentucky
are
ignorant
and
lukewarm
while
those
who
are
active
and
enlightened
either
do
nothing
or
pass
over
into
the
state
of
ohio
where
they
may
work
without
dishonor
it
is
true
that
in
kentucky
the
planters
are
not
obliged
to
pay
wages
to
the
slaves
whom
they
employ
but
they
derive
small
profits
from
their
labor
while
the
wages
paid
to
free
workmen
would
be
returned
with
interest
in
the
value
of
their
services
the
free
workman
is
paid
but
he
does
his
work
quicker
than
the
slave
and
rapidity
of
execution
is
one
of
the
great
elements
of
economy
the
white
sells
his
services
but
they
are
only
purchased
at
the
times
at
which
they
may
be
useful
the
black
can
claim
no
remuneration
for
his
toil
but
the
expense
of
his
maintenance
is
perpetual
he
must
be
supported
in
his
old
age
as
well
as
in
the
prime
of
manhood
in
his
profitless
infancy
as
well
as
in
the
productive
years
of
youth
payment
must
equally
be
made
in
order
to
obtain
the
services
of
either
class
of
men
the
free
workman
receives
his
wages
in
money
the
slave
in
education
in
food
in
care
and
in
clothing
the
money
which
a
master
spends
in
the
maintenance
of
his
slaves
goes
gradually
and
in
detail
so
that
it
is
scarcely
perceived
the
salary
of
the
free
workman
is
paid
in
a
round
sum
which
appears
only
to
enrich
the
individual
who
receives
it
but
in
the
end
the
slave
has
cost
more
than
the
free
servant
and
his
labor
is
less
productive
the
influence
of
slavery
extends
still
farther
it
affects
the
character
of
the
master
and
imparts
a
peculiar
tendency
to
his
ideas
and
his
tastes
upon
both
banks
of
the
ohio
the
character
of
the
inhabitants
is
enterprising
and
energetic
but
this
vigor
is
very
differently
exercised
in
the
two
states
the
white
inhabitant
of
ohio
who
is
obliged
to
subsist
by
his
own
exertions
regards
temporal
prosperity
as
the
principal
aim
of
his
existence
and
as
the
country
which
he
occupies
presents
inexhaustible
resources
to
his
industry
and
lures
to
his
activity
his
acquisitive
ardor
surpasses
the
ordinary
limits
of
human
cupidity
he
is
tormented
by
the
desire
of
wealth
and
he
boldly
enters
upon
every
path
which
fortune
opens
to
him
he
becomes
a
sailor
pioneer
an
artisan
or
a
laborer
with
the
same
indifference
and
he
supports
with
equal
constancy
the
fatigues
and
the
dangers
incidental
to
these
various
professions
the
resources
of
his
intelligence
are
astonishing
and
his
avidity
in
the
pursuit
of
gain
amounts
to
a
species
of
heroism
but
the
kentuckian
scorns
not
only
labor
but
all
the
undertakings
which
labor
promotes
as
he
lives
in
an
idle
independence
his
tastes
are
those
of
an
idle
man
money
loses
a
portion
of
its
value
in
his
eyes
he
covets
wealth
much
less
than
pleasure
and
excitement
and
the
energy
which
his
neighbor
devotes
to
gain
turns
with
him
to
a
passionate
love
of
field
sports
and
military
exercises
he
delights
in
violent
bodily
exertion
he
is
familiar
with
the
use
of
arms
and
is
accustomed
from
a
very
early
age
to
expose
his
life
in
single
combat
thus
slavery
not
only
prevents
the
whites
from
becoming
opulent
but
even
from
desiring
to
become
so
as
the
same
causes
have
been
continually
producing
opposite
effects
for
the
last
two
centuries
in
the
british
colonies
of
north
america
they
have
established
a
very
striking
difference
between
the
commercial
capacity
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
south
and
that
of
the
north
at
the
present
day
it
is
only
the
northern
states
which
are
in
possession
of
shipping
manufactures
railroads
and
canals
this
difference
is
perceptible
not
only
in
comparing
the
north
with
the
south
but
in
comparing
the
several
southern
states
almost
all
the
individuals
who
carry
on
commercial
operations
or
who
endeavor
to
turn
to
account
in
the
most
southern
districts
of
the
union
have
emigrated
from
the
north
the
natives
of
the
northern
states
are
constantly
spreading
over
that
portion
of
the
american
territory
where
they
have
less
to
fear
from
competition
they
discover
resources
there
which
escaped
the
notice
of
the
inhabitants
and
as
they
comply
with
a
system
which
they
do
not
approve
they
succeed
in
turning
it
to
better
advantage
than
those
who
first
founded
and
who
still
maintain
it
were
i
inclined
to
continue
this
parallel
i
could
easily
prove
that
almost
all
the
differences
which
may
be
remarked
between
the
characters
of
the
americans
in
the
southern
and
in
the
northern
states
have
originated
in
slavery
but
this
would
divert
me
from
my
subject
and
my
present
intention
is
not
to
point
out
all
the
consequences
of
servitude
but
those
effects
which
it
has
produced
upon
the
prosperity
of
the
countries
which
have
admitted
it
the
influence
of
slavery
upon
the
production
of
wealth
must
have
been
very
imperfectly
known
in
antiquity
as
slavery
then
obtained
throughout
the
civilized
world
and
the
nations
which
were
unacquainted
with
it
were
barbarous
and
indeed
christianity
only
abolished
slavery
by
advocating
the
claims
of
the
slave
at
the
present
time
it
may
be
attacked
in
the
name
of
the
master
and
upon
this
point
interest
is
reconciled
with
morality
as
these
truths
became
apparent
in
the
united
states
slavery
receded
before
the
progress
of
experience
servitude
had
begun
in
the
south
and
had
thence
spread
toward
the
north
but
it
now
retires
again
freedom
which
started
from
the
north
now
descends
uninterruptedly
toward
the
south
among
the
great
states
pennsylvania
now
constitutes
the
extreme
limit
of
slavery
to
the
north
but
even
within
those
limits
the
is
shaken
maryland
which
is
immediately
below
pennsylvania
is
preparing
for
its
abolition
and
virginia
which
comes
next
to
maryland
is
already
discussing
its
utility
and
its
dangers
no
great
change
takes
place
in
human
institutions
without
involving
among
its
causes
the
law
of
inheritance
when
the
law
of
primogeniture
obtained
in
the
south
each
family
was
represented
by
a
wealthy
individual
who
was
neither
compelled
nor
induced
to
labor
and
he
was
surrounded
as
by
parasitic
plants
by
the
other
members
of
his
family
who
were
then
excluded
by
law
from
sharing
the
common
inheritance
and
who
led
the
same
kind
of
life
as
himself
the
very
same
thing
then
occurred
in
all
the
families
of
the
south
that
still
happens
in
the
wealthy
families
of
some
countries
in
europe
namely
that
the
younger
sons
remain
in
the
same
state
of
idleness
as
their
elder
brother
without
being
as
rich
as
he
is
this
identical
result
seems
to
be
produced
in
europe
and
in
america
by
wholly
analogous
causes
in
the
south
of
the
united
states
the
whole
race
of
whites
formed
an
aristocratic
body
which
was
headed
by
a
certain
number
of
privileged
individuals
whose
wealth
was
permanent
and
whose
leisure
was
hereditary
these
leaders
of
the
american
nobility
kept
alive
the
traditional
prejudices
of
the
white
race
in
the
body
of
which
they
were
the
representatives
and
maintained
the
honor
of
inactive
life
this
aristocracy
contained
many
who
were
poor
but
none
who
would
work
its
members
preferred
want
to
labor
consequently
no
competition
was
set
on
foot
against
negro
laborers
and
slaves
and
whatever
opinion
might
be
entertained
as
to
the
utility
of
their
efforts
it
was
indispensable
to
employ
them
since
there
was
no
one
else
to
work
no
sooner
was
the
law
of
primogeniture
abolished
than
fortunes
began
to
diminish
and
all
the
families
of
the
country
were
simultaneously
reduced
to
a
state
in
which
labor
became
necessary
to
procure
the
means
of
subsistence
several
of
them
have
since
entirely
disappeared
and
all
of
them
learned
to
look
forward
to
the
time
at
which
it
would
be
necessary
for
every
one
to
provide
for
his
own
wants
wealthy
individuals
are
still
to
be
met
with
but
they
no
longer
constitute
a
compact
and
hereditary
body
nor
have
they
been
able
to
adopt
a
line
of
conduct
in
which
they
could
persevere
and
which
they
could
infuse
into
all
ranks
of
society
the
prejudice
which
stigmatized
labor
was
in
the
first
place
abandoned
by
common
consent
the
number
of
needy
men
was
increased
and
the
needy
were
allowed
to
gain
a
laborious
subsistence
without
blushing
for
their
exertions
thus
one
of
the
most
immediate
consequences
of
the
partible
quality
of
estates
has
been
to
create
a
class
of
free
laborers
as
soon
as
a
competition
was
set
on
foot
between
the
free
laborer
and
the
slave
the
inferiority
of
the
latter
became
manifest
and
slavery
was
attacked
in
its
fundamental
principles
which
is
the
interest
of
the
master
as
slavery
recedes
the
black
population
follows
its
retrograde
course
and
returns
with
it
to
those
tropical
regions
from
which
it
originally
came
however
singular
this
fact
may
at
first
appear
to
be
it
may
readily
be
explained
although
the
americans
abolish
the
principle
of
slavery
they
do
not
set
their
slaves
free
to
illustrate
this
remark
i
will
quote
the
example
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
state
of
new
york
prohibited
the
sale
of
slaves
within
its
limits
which
was
an
indirect
method
of
prohibiting
the
importation
of
blacks
thenceforward
the
number
of
negroes
could
only
increase
according
to
the
ratio
of
the
natural
increase
of
population
but
eight
years
later
a
more
decisive
measure
was
taken
and
it
was
enacted
that
all
children
born
of
slave
parents
after
the
of
july
should
be
free
no
increase
could
then
take
place
and
although
slaves
still
existed
slavery
might
be
said
to
be
abolished
from
the
time
at
which
a
northern
state
prohibited
the
importation
of
slaves
no
slaves
were
brought
from
the
south
to
be
sold
in
its
markets
on
the
other
hand
as
the
sale
of
slaves
was
forbidden
in
that
state
an
owner
was
no
longer
able
to
get
rid
of
his
slaves
who
thus
became
a
burdensome
possession
otherwise
than
by
transporting
him
to
the
south
but
when
a
northern
state
declared
that
the
son
of
the
slave
should
be
born
free
the
slave
lost
a
large
portion
of
his
market
value
since
his
posterity
was
no
longer
included
in
the
bargain
and
the
owner
had
then
a
strong
interest
in
transporting
him
to
the
south
thus
the
same
law
prevents
the
slaves
of
the
south
from
coming
to
the
northern
states
and
drives
those
of
the
north
to
the
south
the
want
of
free
hands
is
felt
in
a
state
in
proportion
as
the
number
of
slaves
decreases
but
in
proportion
as
labor
is
performed
by
free
hands
becomes
less
productive
and
the
slave
is
then
a
useless
or
an
onerous
possession
whom
it
is
important
to
export
to
those
southern
states
where
the
same
competition
is
not
to
be
feared
thus
the
abolition
of
slavery
does
not
set
the
slave
free
but
it
merely
transfers
him
from
one
master
to
another
and
from
the
north
to
the
south
the
emancipated
negroes
and
those
born
after
the
abolition
of
slavery
do
not
indeed
migrate
from
the
north
to
the
south
but
their
situation
with
regard
to
the
europeans
is
not
unlike
that
of
the
aborigines
of
america
they
remain
half
civilized
and
deprived
of
their
rights
in
the
midst
of
a
population
which
is
far
superior
to
them
in
wealth
and
in
knowledge
where
they
are
exposed
to
the
tyranny
of
the
laws
and
the
intolerance
of
the
people
on
some
accounts
they
are
still
more
to
be
pitied
than
the
indians
since
they
are
haunted
by
the
reminiscence
of
slavery
and
they
can
not
claim
possession
of
a
single
portion
of
the
soil
many
of
them
perish
miserably
and
the
rest
congregate
in
the
great
towns
where
they
perform
the
meanest
offices
and
lead
a
wretched
and
precarious
existence
but
even
if
the
number
of
negroes
continued
to
increase
as
rapidly
as
when
they
were
still
in
a
state
of
slavery
as
the
number
of
whites
augments
with
twofold
rapidity
since
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
blacks
would
soon
be
as
it
were
lost
in
the
midst
of
a
strange
population
a
district
which
is
cultivated
by
slaves
is
in
general
more
scantily
peopled
than
a
district
cultivated
by
free
labor
moreover
america
is
still
a
new
country
and
a
state
is
therefore
not
half
peopled
at
the
time
when
it
abolished
slavery
no
sooner
is
an
end
put
to
slavery
than
the
want
of
free
labor
is
felt
and
a
crowd
of
enterprising
adventurers
immediately
arrive
from
all
parts
of
the
country
who
hasten
to
profit
by
the
fresh
resources
which
are
then
opened
to
industry
the
soil
is
soon
divided
among
them
and
a
family
of
white
settlers
takes
possession
of
each
tract
of
country
besides
which
european
emigration
is
exclusively
directed
to
the
free
states
for
what
would
be
the
fate
of
a
poor
emigrant
who
crosses
the
atlantic
in
search
of
ease
and
happiness
if
he
were
to
land
in
a
country
where
labor
is
stigmatized
as
degrading
thus
the
white
population
grows
by
its
natural
increase
and
at
the
same
time
by
the
immense
influx
of
emigrants
while
the
black
population
receives
no
emigrants
and
is
upon
its
decline
the
proportion
which
existed
between
the
two
races
is
soon
inverted
the
negroes
constitute
a
scanty
remnant
a
poor
tribe
of
vagrants
which
is
lost
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
people
in
full
possession
of
the
land
and
the
presence
of
the
blacks
is
only
marked
by
the
injustice
and
the
hardships
of
which
they
are
the
unhappy
victims
in
several
of
the
western
states
the
negro
race
never
made
its
appearance
and
in
all
the
northern
states
it
is
rapidly
declining
thus
the
great
question
of
its
future
condition
is
confined
within
a
narrow
circle
where
it
becomes
less
formidable
though
not
more
easy
of
solution
the
more
we
descend
toward
the
south
the
more
difficult
does
it
become
to
abolish
slavery
with
advantage
and
this
arises
from
several
physical
causes
which
it
is
important
to
point
out
the
first
of
these
causes
is
the
climate
it
is
well
known
that
in
proportion
as
europeans
approach
the
tropics
they
suffer
more
from
labor
many
of
the
americans
even
assert
that
within
a
certain
latitude
the
exertions
which
a
negro
can
make
without
danger
are
fatal
to
them
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
opinion
which
is
so
favorable
to
the
indolence
of
the
inhabitants
of
southern
regions
is
confirmed
by
experience
the
southern
parts
of
the
union
are
not
hotter
than
the
south
of
italy
and
of
spain
and
it
may
be
asked
why
the
european
can
not
work
as
well
there
as
in
the
two
latter
countries
if
slavery
has
been
abolished
in
italy
and
in
spain
without
causing
the
destruction
of
the
masters
why
should
not
the
same
thing
take
place
in
the
union
i
can
not
believe
that
nature
has
prohibited
the
europeans
in
georgia
and
the
floridas
under
pain
of
death
from
raising
the
means
of
subsistence
from
the
soil
but
their
labor
would
unquestionably
be
more
irksome
and
less
productive
to
them
than
the
inhabitants
of
new
england
as
the
free
workman
thus
loses
a
portion
of
his
superiority
over
the
slave
in
the
southern
states
there
are
fewer
inducements
to
abolish
slavery
all
the
plants
of
europe
grow
in
the
northern
parts
of
the
union
the
south
has
special
productions
of
its
own
it
has
been
observed
that
slave
labor
is
a
very
expensive
method
of
cultivating
corn
the
farmer
of
in
a
country
where
slavery
is
unknown
habitually
retains
a
small
number
of
laborers
in
his
service
and
at
and
harvest
he
hires
several
additional
hands
who
only
live
at
his
cost
for
a
short
period
but
the
agriculturist
in
a
slave
state
is
obliged
to
keep
a
large
number
of
slaves
the
whole
year
round
in
order
to
sow
his
fields
and
to
gather
in
his
crops
although
their
services
are
only
required
for
a
few
weeks
but
slaves
are
unable
to
wait
till
they
are
hired
and
to
subsist
by
their
own
labor
in
the
meantime
like
free
laborers
in
order
to
have
their
services
they
must
be
bought
slavery
independently
of
its
general
disadvantages
is
therefore
still
more
inapplicable
to
countries
in
which
corn
is
cultivated
than
to
those
which
produce
crops
of
a
different
kind
the
cultivation
of
tobacco
of
cotton
and
especially
of
the
demands
on
the
other
hand
unremitting
attention
and
women
and
children
are
employed
in
it
whose
services
are
of
but
little
use
in
the
cultivation
of
wheat
thus
slavery
is
naturally
more
fitted
to
the
countries
from
which
these
productions
are
derived
tobacco
cotton
and
the
are
exclusively
grown
in
the
south
and
they
form
one
of
the
principal
sources
of
the
wealth
of
those
states
if
slavery
were
abolished
the
inhabitants
of
the
south
would
be
constrained
to
adopt
one
of
two
alternatives
they
must
either
change
their
system
of
cultivation
and
then
they
would
come
into
competition
with
the
more
active
and
more
experienced
inhabitants
of
the
north
or
if
they
continued
to
cultivate
the
same
produce
without
slave
labor
they
would
have
to
support
the
competition
of
the
other
states
of
the
south
which
might
still
retain
their
slaves
thus
peculiar
reasons
for
maintaining
slavery
exist
in
the
south
which
do
not
operate
in
the
north
but
there
is
yet
another
motive
which
is
more
cogent
than
all
the
others
the
south
might
indeed
rigorously
speaking
abolish
slavery
but
how
should
it
rid
its
territory
of
the
black
population
slaves
and
slavery
are
driven
from
the
north
by
the
same
law
but
this
twofold
result
can
not
be
hoped
for
in
the
south
the
arguments
which
i
have
adduced
to
show
that
slavery
is
more
natural
and
more
advantageous
in
the
south
than
in
the
north
sufficiently
prove
that
the
number
of
slaves
must
be
far
greater
in
the
former
districts
it
was
to
the
southern
settlements
that
the
first
africans
were
brought
and
it
is
there
that
the
greatest
number
of
them
have
always
been
imported
as
we
advance
toward
the
south
the
prejudice
which
sanctions
idleness
increases
in
power
in
the
states
nearest
to
the
tropics
there
is
not
a
single
white
laborer
the
negroes
are
consequently
much
more
numerous
in
the
south
than
in
the
north
and
as
i
have
already
observed
this
disproportion
increases
daily
since
the
negroes
are
transferred
to
one
part
of
the
union
as
soon
as
slavery
is
abolished
in
the
other
thus
the
black
population
augments
in
the
south
not
only
by
its
natural
fecundity
but
by
the
compulsory
emigration
of
the
negroes
from
the
north
and
the
african
race
has
causes
of
increase
in
the
south
very
analogous
to
those
which
so
powerfully
accelerate
the
growth
of
the
european
race
in
the
north
in
the
state
of
maine
there
is
one
negro
in
three
hundred
inhabitants
in
massachusetts
one
in
one
hundred
in
new
york
two
in
one
hundred
in
pennsylvania
three
in
the
same
number
in
maryland
in
virginia
and
lastly
in
south
carolina
per
cent
such
was
the
proportion
of
the
black
population
to
the
whites
in
the
year
but
this
proportion
is
perpetually
changing
as
it
constantly
decreases
in
the
north
and
augments
in
the
south
it
is
evident
that
the
most
southern
states
of
the
union
can
not
abolish
slavery
without
incurring
very
great
dangers
which
the
north
had
no
reason
to
apprehend
when
it
emancipated
its
black
population
we
have
already
shown
the
system
by
which
the
northern
states
secure
the
transition
from
slavery
to
freedom
by
keeping
the
present
generation
in
chains
and
setting
their
descendants
free
by
this
means
the
negroes
are
gradually
introduced
into
society
and
while
the
men
who
might
abuse
their
freedom
are
kept
in
a
state
of
servitude
those
who
are
emancipated
may
learn
the
art
of
being
free
before
they
become
their
own
masters
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
apply
this
method
in
the
south
to
declare
that
all
the
negroes
born
after
a
certain
period
shall
be
free
is
to
introduce
the
principle
and
the
notion
of
liberty
into
the
heart
of
slavery
the
blacks
whom
the
law
thus
maintains
in
a
state
of
slavery
from
which
their
children
are
delivered
are
astonished
at
so
unequal
a
fate
and
their
astonishment
is
only
the
prelude
to
their
impatience
and
irritation
thenceforward
slavery
loses
in
their
eyes
that
kind
of
moral
power
which
it
derived
from
time
and
habit
it
is
reduced
to
a
mere
palpable
abuse
of
force
the
northern
states
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
contrast
because
in
them
the
blacks
were
few
in
number
and
the
white
population
was
very
considerable
but
if
this
faint
dawn
of
freedom
were
to
show
two
millions
of
men
their
true
position
the
oppressors
would
have
reason
to
tremble
after
having
enfranchised
the
children
of
their
slaves
the
europeans
of
the
southern
states
would
very
shortly
be
obliged
to
extend
the
same
benefit
to
the
whole
black
population
in
the
north
as
i
have
already
remarked
a
migration
ensues
upon
the
abolition
of
slavery
or
even
precedes
that
event
when
circumstances
have
rendered
it
probable
the
slaves
quit
the
country
to
be
transported
southward
and
the
whites
of
the
northern
states
as
well
as
the
emigrants
from
europe
hasten
to
fill
up
their
place
but
these
two
causes
can
not
operate
in
the
same
manner
in
the
southern
states
on
the
one
hand
the
mass
of
slaves
is
too
great
for
any
expectation
of
their
ever
being
removed
from
the
country
to
be
entertained
and
on
the
other
hand
the
europeans
and
the
of
the
north
are
afraid
to
come
to
inhabit
a
country
in
which
labor
has
not
yet
been
reinstated
in
its
rightful
honors
besides
they
very
justly
look
upon
the
states
in
which
the
proportion
of
the
negroes
equals
or
exceeds
that
of
the
whites
as
exposed
to
very
great
dangers
and
they
refrain
from
turning
their
activity
in
that
direction
thus
the
inhabitants
if
the
south
would
not
be
able
like
their
northern
countrymen
to
initiate
the
slaves
gradually
into
a
state
of
freedom
by
abolishing
slavery
they
have
no
means
of
perceptibly
diminishing
the
black
population
and
they
would
remain
unsupported
to
repress
its
excesses
so
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
a
great
people
of
free
negroes
would
exist
in
the
heart
of
a
white
nation
of
equal
size
the
same
abuses
of
power
which
still
maintain
slavery
would
then
become
the
source
of
the
most
alarming
perils
which
the
white
population
of
the
south
might
have
to
apprehend
at
the
present
time
the
descendants
of
the
europeans
are
the
sole
owners
of
the
land
the
absolute
masters
of
all
labor
and
the
only
persons
who
are
possessed
of
wealth
knowledge
and
arms
the
black
is
destitute
of
all
these
advantages
but
he
subsists
without
them
because
he
is
a
slave
if
he
were
free
and
obliged
to
provide
for
his
own
subsistence
would
it
be
possible
for
him
to
remain
without
these
things
and
to
support
life
or
would
not
the
very
instruments
of
the
present
superiority
of
the
white
while
slavery
exists
expose
him
to
a
thousand
dangers
if
it
were
abolished
as
long
as
the
negro
remains
a
slave
he
may
be
kept
in
a
condition
not
very
far
removed
from
that
of
the
brutes
but
with
his
liberty
he
can
not
but
acquire
a
degree
of
instruction
which
will
enable
him
to
appreciate
his
misfortunes
and
to
discern
a
remedy
for
them
moreover
there
exists
a
singular
principle
of
relative
justice
which
is
very
firmly
implanted
in
the
human
heart
men
are
much
more
forcibly
struck
by
those
inequalities
which
exist
within
the
circles
of
the
same
class
than
with
those
which
may
be
remarked
between
different
classes
it
is
more
easy
for
them
to
admit
slavery
than
to
allow
several
millions
of
citizens
to
exist
under
a
load
of
eternal
infamy
and
hereditary
wretchedness
in
the
north
the
population
of
freed
negroes
feels
these
hardships
and
resents
these
indignities
but
its
members
and
its
powers
are
small
while
in
the
south
it
would
be
numerous
and
strong
as
soon
as
it
is
admitted
that
the
whites
and
the
emancipated
blacks
are
placed
upon
the
same
territory
in
the
situation
of
two
alien
communities
it
will
readily
be
understood
that
there
are
but
two
alternatives
for
the
future
the
negroes
and
the
whites
must
either
wholly
part
or
wholly
mingle
i
have
already
expressed
the
conviction
which
i
entertain
as
to
the
latter
event
i
do
not
imagine
that
the
white
and
the
black
races
will
ever
live
in
any
country
upon
an
equal
footing
but
i
believe
the
difficulty
to
be
still
greater
in
the
united
states
than
elsewhere
an
isolated
individual
may
surmount
the
prejudices
of
religion
of
his
country
or
of
his
race
and
if
this
individual
is
a
king
he
may
effect
surprising
changes
in
society
but
a
whole
people
can
not
rise
as
it
were
above
itself
a
despot
who
should
subject
the
americans
and
their
former
slaves
to
the
same
yoke
might
perhaps
succeed
in
commingling
their
races
but
as
long
as
the
american
democracy
remains
at
the
head
of
affairs
no
one
will
undertake
so
difficult
a
task
and
it
may
be
foreseen
that
the
freer
the
white
population
of
the
united
states
becomes
the
more
isolated
will
it
remain
i
have
previously
observed
that
the
mixed
race
is
the
true
bond
of
union
between
the
europeans
and
the
indians
just
so
the
mulattoes
are
the
true
means
of
transition
between
the
white
and
the
negro
so
that
wherever
mulattoes
abound
the
intermixture
of
the
two
races
is
not
impossible
in
some
parts
of
america
the
european
and
the
negro
races
are
so
crossed
by
one
another
that
it
is
rare
to
meet
with
a
man
who
is
entirely
black
or
entirely
white
when
they
are
arrived
at
this
point
the
two
races
may
really
be
said
to
be
combined
or
rather
to
have
been
absorbed
in
a
third
race
which
is
connected
with
both
without
being
identical
with
either
of
all
the
europeans
the
english
are
those
who
have
mixed
least
with
the
negroes
more
mulattoes
are
to
be
seen
in
the
south
of
the
union
than
in
the
north
but
still
they
are
infinitely
more
scarce
than
in
any
other
european
colony
mulattoes
are
by
no
means
numerous
in
the
united
states
they
have
no
force
peculiar
to
themselves
and
when
quarrels
originating
in
differences
of
color
take
place
they
generally
side
with
the
whites
just
as
the
lacqueys
of
the
great
in
europe
assume
the
contemptuous
airs
of
nobility
to
the
lower
orders
the
pride
of
origin
which
is
natural
to
the
english
is
singularly
augmented
by
the
personal
pride
which
democratic
liberty
fosters
among
the
americans
the
white
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
proud
of
his
race
and
proud
of
himself
but
if
the
whites
and
the
negroes
do
not
intermingle
in
the
north
of
the
union
how
should
they
mix
in
the
south
can
it
be
supposed
for
an
instant
that
an
american
of
the
southern
states
placed
as
he
must
for
ever
be
between
the
white
man
with
all
his
physical
and
moral
superiority
and
the
negro
will
ever
think
of
preferring
the
latter
the
americans
of
the
southern
states
have
two
powerful
passions
which
will
always
keep
them
aloof
the
first
is
the
fear
of
being
assimilated
to
the
negroes
their
former
slaves
and
the
second
the
dread
of
sinking
below
the
whites
their
neighbors
if
i
were
called
upon
to
predict
what
will
probably
occur
at
some
future
time
i
should
say
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
south
will
in
the
common
course
of
things
increase
the
repugnance
of
the
white
population
for
the
men
of
color
i
found
this
opinion
upon
the
analogous
observation
which
i
already
had
occasion
to
make
in
the
north
i
there
remarked
that
the
white
inhabitants
of
the
north
avoid
the
negroes
with
increasing
care
in
proportion
as
the
legal
barriers
of
separation
are
removed
by
the
legislature
and
why
should
not
the
same
result
take
place
in
the
south
in
the
north
the
whites
are
deterred
from
intermingling
with
the
blacks
by
the
fear
of
an
imaginary
danger
in
the
south
where
the
danger
would
be
real
i
can
not
imagine
that
the
fear
would
be
less
general
if
on
the
one
hand
it
be
admitted
and
the
fact
is
unquestionable
that
the
colored
population
perpetually
accumulates
in
the
extreme
south
and
that
it
increases
more
rapidly
than
that
of
the
whites
and
if
on
the
other
hand
it
be
allowed
that
it
is
impossible
to
foresee
a
time
at
which
the
whites
and
the
blacks
will
be
so
intermingled
as
to
derive
the
same
benefits
from
society
must
it
not
be
inferred
that
the
blacks
and
the
whites
will
sooner
or
later
come
to
open
strife
in
the
southern
states
of
the
union
but
if
it
be
asked
what
the
issue
of
the
struggle
is
likely
to
be
it
will
readily
be
understood
that
we
are
here
left
to
form
a
very
vague
surmise
of
the
truth
the
human
mind
may
succeed
in
tracing
a
wide
circle
as
it
were
which
includes
the
course
of
future
events
but
within
that
circle
a
thousand
various
chances
and
circumstances
may
direct
it
in
as
many
different
ways
and
in
every
picture
of
the
future
there
is
a
dim
spot
which
the
eye
of
the
understanding
can
not
penetrate
it
appears
however
to
be
extremely
probable
that
in
the
west
india
islands
the
white
race
is
destined
to
be
subdued
and
the
black
population
to
share
the
same
fate
upon
the
continent
in
the
west
india
islands
the
white
planters
are
surrounded
by
an
immense
black
population
on
the
continent
the
blacks
are
placed
between
the
ocean
and
an
innumerable
people
which
already
extends
over
them
in
a
dense
mass
from
the
icy
confines
of
canada
to
the
frontiers
of
virginia
and
from
the
banks
of
the
missouri
to
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
if
the
white
citizens
of
north
america
remain
united
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
the
negroes
will
escape
the
destruction
with
which
they
are
menaced
they
must
be
subdued
by
want
or
by
the
sword
but
the
black
population
which
is
accumulating
along
the
coast
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
has
a
chance
of
success
if
the
american
union
is
dissolved
when
the
struggle
between
the
two
races
begins
if
the
federal
tie
were
broken
the
citizens
of
the
south
would
be
wrong
to
rely
upon
any
lasting
succor
from
their
northern
countrymen
the
latter
are
well
aware
that
the
danger
can
never
reach
them
and
unless
they
are
constrained
to
march
to
the
assistance
of
the
south
by
a
positive
obligation
it
may
be
foreseen
that
the
sympathy
of
color
will
be
insufficient
to
stimulate
their
exertions
yet
at
whatever
period
the
strife
may
break
out
the
whites
of
the
south
even
if
they
are
abandoned
to
their
own
resources
will
enter
the
lists
with
an
immense
superiority
of
knowledge
and
of
the
means
of
warfare
but
the
blacks
will
have
numerical
strength
and
the
energy
of
despair
upon
their
side
and
these
are
powerful
resources
to
men
who
have
taken
up
arms
the
fate
of
the
white
population
of
the
southern
states
will
perhaps
be
similar
to
that
of
the
moors
in
spain
after
having
occupied
the
land
for
centuries
it
will
perhaps
be
forced
to
retire
to
the
country
whence
its
ancestors
came
and
to
abandon
to
the
negroes
the
possession
of
a
territory
which
providence
seems
to
have
more
peculiarly
destined
for
them
since
they
can
subsist
and
labor
in
it
more
easily
than
the
whites
the
danger
of
a
conflict
between
the
white
and
the
black
inhabitants
of
the
southern
states
of
the
union
a
danger
which
however
remote
it
may
be
is
inevitable
perpetually
haunts
the
imagination
of
the
americans
the
inhabitants
of
the
north
make
it
a
common
topic
of
conversation
although
they
have
no
direct
injury
to
fear
from
the
struggle
but
they
vainly
endeavor
to
devise
some
means
of
obviating
the
misfortunes
which
they
foresee
in
the
southern
states
the
subject
is
not
discussed
the
planter
does
not
allude
to
the
future
in
conversing
with
strangers
the
citizen
does
not
communicate
his
apprehensions
to
his
friends
he
seeks
to
conceal
them
from
himself
but
there
is
something
more
alarming
in
the
tacit
forebodings
of
the
south
than
in
the
clamorous
fears
of
the
northern
states
this
disquietude
has
given
birth
to
an
undertaking
which
is
but
little
known
but
which
may
have
the
effect
of
changing
the
fate
of
a
portion
of
the
human
race
from
apprehension
of
the
dangers
which
i
have
just
been
describing
a
certain
number
of
american
citizens
have
formed
a
society
for
the
purpose
of
exporting
to
the
coast
of
guinea
at
their
own
expense
such
free
negroes
as
may
be
willing
to
escape
from
the
oppression
to
which
they
are
subject
in
the
society
to
which
i
allude
formed
a
settlement
in
africa
upon
the
degree
of
north
latitude
which
bears
the
name
of
liberia
the
most
recent
intelligence
informs
us
that
two
thousand
five
hundred
negroes
are
collected
there
they
have
introduced
the
democratic
institutions
of
america
into
the
country
of
their
forefathers
and
liberia
has
a
representative
system
of
government
and
churches
have
been
built
newspapers
established
and
by
a
singular
change
in
the
vicissitudes
of
the
world
white
men
are
prohibited
from
sojourning
within
the
settlement
this
is
indeed
a
strange
caprice
of
fortune
two
hundred
years
have
now
elapsed
since
the
inhabitants
of
europe
undertook
to
tear
the
negro
from
his
family
and
his
home
in
order
to
transport
him
to
the
shores
of
north
america
at
the
present
day
the
european
settlers
are
engaged
in
sending
back
the
descendants
of
those
very
negroes
to
the
continent
from
which
they
were
originally
taken
and
the
barbarous
africans
have
been
brought
into
contact
with
civilisation
in
the
midst
of
bondage
and
have
become
acquainted
with
free
political
institutions
in
slavery
up
to
the
present
time
africa
has
been
closed
against
the
arts
and
sciences
of
the
whites
but
the
inventions
of
europe
will
perhaps
penetrate
into
those
regions
now
that
they
are
introduced
by
africans
themselves
the
settlement
of
liberia
is
founded
upon
a
lofty
and
a
most
fruitful
idea
but
whatever
may
be
its
results
with
regard
to
the
continent
of
africa
it
can
afford
no
remedy
to
the
new
world
in
twelve
years
the
colonization
society
has
transported
two
thousand
five
hundred
negroes
to
africa
in
the
same
space
of
time
about
seven
hundred
thousand
blacks
were
born
in
the
united
states
if
the
colony
of
liberia
were
so
situated
as
to
be
able
to
receive
thousands
of
new
inhabitants
every
year
and
if
the
negroes
were
in
a
state
to
be
sent
thither
with
advantage
if
the
union
were
to
supply
the
society
with
annual
subsidies
and
to
transport
the
negroes
to
liberia
there
is
little
chance
that
the
negro
population
of
the
united
states
would
change
in
the
south
however
this
leaves
two
choices
either
for
the
whites
to
remain
in
communities
with
the
negroes
and
to
intermingle
with
them
or
remaining
isolated
from
them
to
keep
them
in
a
state
of
slavery
as
long
as
possible
all
intermediate
measures
seem
to
me
likely
to
terminate
and
that
shortly
in
the
most
horrible
of
civil
wars
and
perhaps
in
the
extirpation
of
one
or
other
of
the
two
races
such
is
the
view
which
the
americans
of
the
south
take
of
the
question
and
they
act
consistently
with
it
as
they
are
determined
not
to
mingle
with
the
negroes
they
refuse
to
emancipate
them
not
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
south
regard
slavery
as
necessary
to
the
wealth
of
the
planter
for
on
this
point
many
of
them
agree
with
their
northern
countrymen
in
freely
admitting
that
slavery
is
prejudicial
to
their
interests
but
they
are
convinced
that
however
prejudicial
it
may
be
they
hold
their
lives
upon
no
other
tenure
the
instruction
which
is
now
diffused
in
the
south
has
convinced
the
inhabitants
that
slavery
is
injurious
to
the
but
it
has
also
shown
them
more
clearly
than
before
that
no
means
exist
of
getting
rid
of
its
bad
consequences
hence
arises
a
singular
contrast
the
more
the
utility
of
slavery
is
contested
the
more
firmly
is
it
established
in
the
laws
and
while
the
principle
of
servitude
is
gradually
abolished
in
the
north
that
principle
gives
rise
to
more
and
more
rigorous
consequences
in
the
south
the
legislation
of
the
southern
states
with
regard
to
slaves
presents
at
the
present
day
such
unparalleled
atrocities
as
suffice
to
show
how
radically
the
laws
of
humanity
have
been
perverted
and
to
betray
the
desperate
position
of
the
community
in
which
that
legislation
has
been
promulgated
the
americans
of
this
portion
of
the
union
have
not
indeed
augmented
the
hardships
of
slavery
they
have
on
the
contrary
bettered
the
physical
condition
of
the
slaves
the
only
means
by
which
the
ancients
maintained
slavery
were
fetters
and
death
the
americans
of
the
south
of
the
union
have
discovered
more
intellectual
securities
for
the
duration
of
their
power
they
have
employed
their
despotism
and
their
violence
against
the
human
mind
in
antiquity
precautions
were
taken
to
prevent
the
slave
from
breaking
his
chains
at
the
present
day
measures
are
adopted
to
deprive
him
even
of
the
desire
of
freedom
the
ancients
kept
the
bodies
of
their
slaves
in
bondage
but
they
placed
no
restraint
upon
the
mind
and
no
check
upon
education
and
they
acted
consistently
with
their
established
principle
since
a
natural
termination
of
slavery
then
existed
and
one
day
or
other
the
slave
might
be
set
free
and
become
the
equal
of
his
master
but
the
americans
of
the
south
who
do
not
admit
that
the
negroes
can
ever
be
commingled
with
themselves
have
forbidden
them
to
be
taught
to
read
or
to
write
under
severe
penalties
and
as
they
will
not
raise
them
to
their
own
level
they
sink
them
as
nearly
as
possible
to
that
of
the
brutes
the
hope
of
liberty
had
always
been
allowed
to
the
slave
to
cheer
the
hardships
of
his
condition
but
the
americans
of
the
south
are
well
aware
that
emancipation
can
not
but
be
dangerous
when
the
freed
man
can
never
be
assimilated
to
his
former
master
to
give
a
man
his
freedom
and
to
leave
him
in
wretchedness
and
ignominy
is
nothing
less
than
to
prepare
a
future
chief
for
a
revolt
of
the
slaves
moreover
it
has
long
been
remarked
that
the
presence
of
a
free
negro
vaguely
agitates
the
minds
of
his
less
fortunate
brethren
and
conveys
to
them
a
dim
notion
of
their
rights
the
americans
of
the
south
have
consequently
taken
measures
to
prevent
from
emancipating
their
slaves
in
most
cases
not
indeed
by
a
positive
prohibition
but
by
subjecting
that
step
to
various
forms
which
it
is
difficult
to
comply
with
i
happened
to
meet
with
an
old
man
in
the
south
of
the
union
who
had
lived
in
illicit
intercourse
with
one
of
his
negresses
and
had
had
several
children
by
her
who
were
born
the
slaves
of
their
father
he
had
indeed
frequently
thought
of
bequeathing
to
them
at
least
their
liberty
but
years
had
elapsed
without
his
being
able
to
surmount
the
legal
obstacles
to
their
emancipation
and
in
the
meanwhile
his
old
age
was
come
and
he
was
about
to
die
he
pictured
to
himself
his
sons
dragged
from
market
to
market
and
passing
from
the
authority
of
a
parent
to
the
rod
of
the
stranger
until
these
horrid
anticipations
worked
his
expiring
imagination
into
phrensy
when
i
saw
him
he
was
a
prey
to
all
the
anguish
of
despair
and
he
made
me
feel
how
awful
is
the
retribution
of
nature
upon
those
who
have
broken
her
laws
these
evils
are
unquestionably
great
but
they
are
the
necessary
and
foreseen
consequences
of
the
very
principle
of
modern
slavery
when
the
europeans
chose
their
slaves
from
a
race
differing
from
their
own
which
many
of
them
considered
as
inferior
to
the
other
races
of
mankind
and
which
they
all
repelled
with
horror
from
any
notion
of
intimate
connexion
they
must
have
believed
that
slavery
would
last
for
ever
since
there
is
no
intermediate
state
which
can
be
durable
between
the
excessive
inequality
produced
by
servitude
and
the
complete
equality
which
originates
in
independence
the
europeans
did
imperfectly
feel
this
truth
but
without
acknowledging
it
even
to
themselves
whenever
they
have
had
to
do
with
negroes
their
conduct
has
either
been
dictated
by
their
interest
and
their
pride
or
by
their
compassion
they
first
violated
every
right
of
humanity
by
their
treatment
of
the
negro
and
they
afterward
informed
him
that
those
rights
were
precious
and
inviolable
they
affected
to
open
their
ranks
to
the
slave
but
the
negroes
who
attempted
to
penetrate
into
the
community
were
driven
back
with
scorn
and
they
have
incautiously
and
involuntarily
been
led
to
admit
of
freedom
instead
of
slavery
without
having
the
courage
to
be
wholly
iniquitous
or
wholly
just
if
it
be
impossible
to
anticipate
a
period
at
which
the
americans
of
the
south
will
mingle
their
blood
with
that
of
the
negroes
can
they
allow
their
slaves
to
become
free
without
compromising
their
own
security
and
if
they
are
obliged
to
keep
that
race
in
bondage
in
order
to
save
their
own
families
may
they
not
be
excused
for
availing
themselves
of
the
means
best
adapted
to
that
end
the
events
which
are
taking
place
in
the
southern
states
of
the
union
appear
to
be
at
once
the
most
horrible
and
the
most
natural
results
of
slavery
when
i
see
the
order
of
nature
overthrown
and
when
i
hear
the
cry
of
humanity
in
its
vain
struggle
against
the
laws
my
indignation
does
not
light
upon
the
men
of
our
own
time
who
were
the
instruments
of
these
outrages
but
i
reserve
my
execration
for
those
who
after
a
thousand
years
of
freedom
brought
back
slavery
into
the
world
once
more
whatever
may
be
the
efforts
of
the
americans
of
the
south
to
maintain
slavery
they
will
not
always
succeed
slavery
which
is
now
confined
to
a
single
tract
of
the
civilized
earth
which
is
attacked
by
christianity
as
unjust
and
by
political
economy
as
prejudicial
and
which
is
now
contrasted
with
democratic
liberties
and
the
information
of
our
age
can
not
survive
by
the
choice
of
the
master
or
the
will
of
the
slave
it
will
cease
and
in
either
case
great
calamities
may
be
expected
to
ensue
if
liberty
be
refused
to
the
negroes
of
the
south
they
will
in
the
end
seize
it
for
themselves
by
force
if
it
be
given
they
will
abuse
it
ere
long
what
are
the
chances
in
favor
of
the
duration
of
the
american
union
and
what
dangers
threaten
it
reasons
why
the
preponderating
force
lies
in
the
states
rather
than
in
the
the
union
will
only
last
as
long
as
all
the
states
choose
to
belong
to
causes
which
tend
to
keep
them
utility
of
the
union
to
resist
foreign
enemies
and
to
prevent
the
existence
of
foreigners
in
no
natural
barriers
between
the
several
no
conflicting
interests
to
divide
reciprocal
interests
of
the
northern
southern
and
western
intellectual
ties
of
uniformity
of
dangers
of
the
union
resulting
from
the
different
characters
and
the
passions
of
its
character
of
the
citizens
in
the
south
and
in
the
the
rapid
growth
of
the
union
one
of
its
greatest
progress
of
the
population
to
the
power
gravitates
in
the
same
passions
originating
from
sudden
turns
of
whether
the
existing
government
of
the
union
tends
to
gain
strength
or
to
lose
various
signs
of
its
internal
waste
the
the
general
jackson
the
maintenance
of
the
existing
institutions
of
the
several
states
depends
in
some
measure
upon
the
maintenance
of
the
union
itself
it
is
therefore
important
in
the
first
instance
to
inquire
into
the
probable
fate
of
the
union
one
point
may
indeed
be
assumed
at
once
if
the
present
confederation
were
dissolved
it
appears
to
me
to
be
incontestable
that
the
states
of
which
it
is
now
composed
would
not
return
to
their
original
isolated
condition
but
that
several
unions
would
then
be
formed
in
the
place
of
one
it
is
not
my
intention
to
inquire
into
the
principles
upon
which
these
new
unions
would
probably
be
established
but
merely
to
show
what
the
causes
are
which
may
effect
the
dismemberment
of
the
existing
confederation
with
this
object
i
shall
be
obliged
to
retrace
some
of
the
steps
which
i
have
already
taken
and
to
revert
to
topics
which
i
have
before
discussed
i
am
aware
that
the
reader
may
accuse
me
of
repetition
but
the
importance
of
the
matter
which
still
remains
to
be
treated
is
my
excuse
i
had
rather
say
too
much
than
say
too
little
to
be
thoroughly
understood
and
i
prefer
injuring
the
author
to
slighting
the
subject
the
legislators
who
formed
the
constitution
of
endeavored
to
confer
a
distinct
and
preponderating
authority
upon
the
federal
power
but
they
were
confined
by
the
conditions
of
the
task
which
they
had
undertaken
to
perform
they
were
not
appointed
to
constitute
the
government
of
a
single
people
but
to
regulate
the
association
of
several
states
and
whatever
their
inclinations
might
be
they
could
not
but
divide
the
exercise
of
sovereignty
in
the
end
in
order
to
understand
the
consequences
of
this
division
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
short
distinction
between
the
affairs
of
government
there
are
some
objects
which
are
national
by
their
very
nature
that
is
to
say
which
affect
the
nation
as
a
body
and
can
only
be
intrusted
to
the
man
or
the
assembly
of
men
who
most
completely
represent
the
entire
nation
among
these
may
be
reckoned
war
and
diplomacy
there
are
other
objects
which
are
provincial
by
their
very
nature
that
is
to
say
which
only
affect
certain
localities
and
which
can
only
be
properly
treated
in
that
locality
such
for
instance
is
the
budget
of
municipality
lastly
there
are
certain
objects
of
a
mixed
nature
which
are
national
inasmuch
as
they
affect
all
the
citizens
who
compose
the
nation
and
which
are
provincial
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
nation
itself
should
provide
for
them
all
such
are
the
rights
which
regulate
the
civil
and
political
condition
of
the
citizens
no
society
can
exist
without
civil
and
political
rights
these
rights
therefore
interest
all
the
citizens
alike
but
it
is
not
always
necessary
to
the
existence
and
the
prosperity
of
the
nation
that
these
rights
should
be
uniform
nor
consequently
that
they
should
be
regulated
by
the
central
authority
there
are
then
two
distinct
categories
of
objects
which
are
submitted
to
the
direction
of
the
sovereign
power
and
these
categories
occur
in
all
communities
whatever
the
basis
of
the
political
constitution
may
otherwise
be
between
these
two
extremes
the
objects
which
i
have
termed
mixed
may
be
considered
to
lie
as
these
objects
are
neither
exclusively
national
nor
entirely
provincial
they
may
be
attained
by
a
national
or
a
provincial
government
according
to
the
agreement
of
the
contracting
parties
without
in
any
way
impairing
the
contract
of
association
the
sovereign
power
is
usually
formed
by
the
union
of
separate
individuals
who
compose
a
people
and
individual
powers
or
collective
forces
each
representing
a
very
small
portion
of
the
sovereign
authority
are
the
sole
elements
which
are
subjected
to
the
general
government
of
their
choice
in
this
case
the
general
government
is
more
naturally
called
upon
to
regulate
not
only
those
affairs
which
are
of
essential
national
importance
but
those
which
are
of
a
more
local
interest
and
the
local
governments
are
reduced
to
that
small
share
of
sovereign
authority
which
is
indispensable
to
their
prosperity
but
sometimes
the
sovereign
authority
is
composed
of
preorganized
political
bodies
by
virtue
of
circumstances
anterior
to
their
union
and
in
this
case
the
provincial
governments
assume
the
control
not
only
of
those
affairs
which
more
peculiarly
belong
to
their
province
but
of
all
or
of
a
part
of
the
mixed
affairs
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
for
the
confederate
nations
which
were
independent
sovereign
states
before
their
union
and
which
still
represent
a
very
considerable
share
of
the
sovereign
power
have
only
consented
to
cede
to
the
general
government
the
exercise
of
those
rights
which
are
indispensable
to
the
union
when
the
national
government
independently
of
the
prerogative
inherent
in
its
nature
is
invested
with
the
right
of
regulating
the
affairs
which
relate
partly
to
the
general
and
partly
to
the
local
interest
it
possesses
a
preponderating
influence
not
only
are
its
own
rights
extensive
but
all
the
rights
which
it
does
not
possess
exist
by
its
sufferance
and
it
may
be
apprehended
that
the
provincial
governments
may
be
deprived
of
their
natural
and
necessary
prerogatives
by
its
influence
when
on
the
other
hand
the
provincial
governments
are
invested
with
the
power
of
regulating
those
same
affairs
of
mixed
interest
an
opposite
tendency
prevails
in
society
the
preponderating
force
resides
in
the
province
not
in
the
nation
and
it
may
be
apprehended
that
the
national
government
may
in
the
end
be
stripped
of
the
privileges
which
are
necessary
to
its
existence
independent
nations
have
therefore
a
natural
tendency
to
centralization
and
confederations
to
dismemberment
it
now
only
remains
for
us
to
apply
these
general
principles
to
the
american
union
the
several
states
were
necessarily
possessed
of
the
right
of
regulating
all
exclusively
provincial
affairs
moreover
these
same
states
retained
the
right
of
determining
the
civil
and
political
competency
of
the
citizens
of
regulating
the
reciprocal
relations
of
the
members
of
the
community
and
of
dispensing
justice
rights
which
are
of
a
general
nature
but
which
do
not
necessarily
appertain
to
the
national
government
we
have
shown
that
the
government
of
the
union
is
invested
with
the
power
of
acting
in
the
name
of
the
whole
nation
in
those
cases
in
which
the
nation
has
to
appear
as
a
single
and
undivided
power
as
for
instance
in
foreign
relations
and
in
offering
a
common
resistance
to
a
common
enemy
in
short
in
conducting
those
affairs
which
i
have
styled
exclusively
national
in
this
division
of
the
rights
of
sovereignty
the
share
of
the
union
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
more
considerable
than
that
of
the
states
but
a
more
attentive
investigation
shows
it
to
be
less
so
the
undertakings
of
the
government
of
the
union
are
more
vast
but
their
influence
is
more
rarely
felt
those
of
the
provincial
government
are
comparatively
small
but
they
are
incessant
and
they
serve
to
keep
alive
the
authority
which
they
represent
the
government
of
the
union
watches
the
general
interests
of
the
country
but
the
general
interests
of
a
people
have
a
very
questionable
influence
upon
individual
happiness
while
provincial
interests
produce
a
most
immediate
effect
upon
the
welfare
of
the
inhabitants
the
union
secures
the
independence
and
the
greatness
of
the
nation
which
do
not
immediately
affect
private
citizens
but
the
several
states
maintain
the
liberty
regulate
the
rights
protect
the
fortune
and
secure
the
life
and
the
whole
future
prosperity
of
every
citizen
the
federal
government
is
very
far
removed
from
its
subjects
while
the
provincial
governments
are
within
the
reach
of
them
all
and
are
ready
to
attend
to
the
smallest
appeal
the
central
government
has
upon
its
side
the
passions
of
a
few
superior
men
who
aspire
to
conduct
it
but
upon
the
side
of
the
provincial
governments
are
the
interests
of
all
those
individuals
who
can
only
hope
to
obtain
power
within
their
own
state
and
who
nevertheless
exercise
the
largest
share
of
authority
over
the
people
because
they
are
placed
nearest
to
its
level
the
americans
have
therefore
much
more
to
hope
and
to
fear
from
the
states
than
from
the
union
and
in
conformity
with
the
natural
tendency
of
the
human
mind
they
are
more
likely
to
attach
themselves
to
the
former
than
to
the
latter
in
this
respect
their
habits
and
feelings
harmonize
with
their
interests
when
a
compact
nation
divides
its
sovereignty
and
adopts
a
confederate
form
of
government
the
traditions
the
customs
and
the
manners
of
the
people
are
for
a
long
time
at
variance
with
their
legislation
and
the
former
tend
to
give
a
degree
of
influence
to
the
central
government
which
the
latter
forbids
when
a
number
of
confederate
states
unite
to
form
a
single
nation
the
same
causes
operate
in
an
opposite
direction
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
france
were
to
become
a
confederate
republic
like
that
of
the
united
states
the
government
would
at
first
display
more
energy
than
that
of
the
union
and
if
the
union
were
to
alter
its
constitution
to
a
monarchy
like
that
of
france
i
think
that
the
american
government
would
be
a
long
time
in
acquiring
the
force
which
now
rules
the
latter
nation
when
the
national
existence
of
the
began
their
provincial
existence
was
already
of
long
standing
necessary
relations
were
established
between
the
townships
and
the
individual
citizens
of
the
same
states
and
they
were
accustomed
to
consider
some
objects
as
common
to
them
all
and
to
conduct
other
affairs
as
exclusively
relating
to
their
own
special
interests
the
union
is
a
vast
body
which
presents
no
definite
object
to
patriotic
feeling
the
forms
and
limits
of
the
state
are
distinct
and
circumscribed
since
it
represents
a
certain
number
of
objects
which
are
familiar
to
the
citizens
and
beloved
by
all
it
is
identified
with
the
very
soil
with
the
right
of
property
and
the
domestic
affections
with
the
recollections
of
the
past
the
labors
of
the
present
and
the
hopes
of
the
future
patriotism
then
which
is
frequently
a
mere
extension
of
individual
egotism
is
still
directed
to
the
state
and
is
not
excited
by
the
union
thus
the
tendency
of
the
interests
the
habits
and
the
feelings
of
the
people
is
to
centre
political
activity
in
the
states
in
preference
to
the
union
it
is
easy
to
estimate
the
different
forces
of
the
two
governments
by
remarking
the
manner
in
which
they
fulfil
their
respective
functions
whenever
the
government
of
a
state
has
occasion
to
address
an
individual
or
an
assembly
of
individuals
its
language
is
clear
and
imperative
and
such
is
also
the
tone
of
the
federal
government
in
its
intercourse
with
individuals
but
no
sooner
has
it
anything
to
do
with
a
state
than
it
begins
to
parley
to
explain
its
motives
and
to
justify
its
conduct
to
argue
to
advise
and
in
short
anything
but
to
command
if
doubts
are
raised
as
to
the
limits
of
the
constitutional
powers
of
each
government
the
provincial
government
prefers
its
claims
with
boldness
and
takes
prompt
and
energetic
steps
to
support
it
in
the
meanwhile
the
government
of
the
union
reasons
it
appeals
to
the
interests
to
the
good
sense
to
the
glory
of
the
nation
it
temporizes
it
negotiates
and
does
not
consent
to
act
until
it
is
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
at
first
sight
it
might
readily
be
imagined
that
it
is
the
provincial
government
which
is
armed
with
the
authority
of
the
nation
and
that
congress
represents
a
single
state
the
federal
government
is
therefore
notwithstanding
the
precautions
of
those
who
founded
it
naturally
so
weak
that
it
more
peculiarly
requires
the
free
consent
of
the
governed
to
enable
it
to
subsist
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
its
object
is
to
enable
the
states
to
realize
with
facility
their
determination
of
remaining
united
and
as
long
as
this
preliminary
consideration
exists
its
authority
is
great
temperate
and
effective
the
constitution
fits
the
government
to
control
individuals
and
easily
to
surmount
such
obstacles
as
they
may
be
inclined
to
offer
but
it
was
by
no
means
established
with
a
view
to
the
possible
separation
of
one
or
more
of
the
states
from
the
union
if
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
were
to
engage
in
a
struggle
with
that
of
the
states
at
the
present
day
its
defeat
may
be
confidently
predicted
and
it
is
not
probable
that
such
a
struggle
would
be
seriously
undertaken
as
often
as
steady
resistance
is
offered
to
the
federal
government
it
will
be
found
to
yield
experience
has
hitherto
shown
that
whenever
a
state
has
demanded
anything
with
perseverance
and
resolution
it
has
invariably
succeeded
and
that
if
a
separate
government
has
distinctly
refused
to
act
it
was
left
to
do
as
it
thought
fit
but
even
if
the
government
of
the
union
had
any
strength
inherent
in
itself
the
physical
situation
of
the
country
would
render
the
exercise
of
that
strength
very
difficult
the
united
states
cover
an
immense
territory
they
are
separated
from
each
other
by
great
distances
and
the
population
is
disseminated
over
the
surface
of
a
country
which
is
still
half
a
wilderness
if
the
union
were
to
undertake
to
enforce
the
allegiance
of
the
confederate
states
by
military
means
it
would
be
in
a
position
very
analogous
to
that
of
england
at
the
time
of
the
war
of
independence
however
strong
a
government
may
be
it
can
not
easily
escape
from
the
consequences
of
a
principle
which
it
has
once
admitted
as
the
foundation
of
its
constitution
the
union
was
formed
by
the
voluntary
agreement
of
the
states
and
in
uniting
together
they
have
not
forfeited
their
nationality
nor
have
they
been
reduced
to
the
condition
of
one
and
the
same
people
if
one
of
the
states
chose
to
withdraw
its
name
from
the
compact
it
would
be
difficult
to
disprove
its
right
of
doing
so
and
the
federal
government
would
have
no
means
of
maintaining
its
claims
directly
either
by
force
or
by
right
in
order
to
enable
the
federal
government
easily
to
conquer
the
resistance
which
may
be
offered
to
it
by
any
one
of
its
subjects
it
would
be
necessary
that
one
or
more
of
them
should
be
especially
interested
in
the
existence
of
the
union
as
has
frequently
been
the
case
in
the
history
of
confederations
if
it
be
supposed
that
among
the
states
which
are
united
by
the
federal
tie
there
are
some
which
exclusively
enjoy
the
principal
advantages
of
union
or
whose
prosperity
depends
on
the
duration
of
that
union
it
is
unquestionable
that
they
will
always
be
ready
to
support
the
central
government
in
enforcing
the
obedience
of
the
others
but
the
government
would
then
be
exerting
a
force
not
derived
from
itself
but
from
a
principle
contrary
to
its
nature
states
form
confederations
in
order
to
derive
equal
advantages
from
their
union
and
in
the
case
just
alluded
to
the
federal
government
would
derive
its
power
from
the
unequal
distribution
of
those
benefits
among
the
states
if
one
of
the
confederated
states
have
acquired
a
preponderance
sufficiently
great
to
enable
it
to
take
exclusive
possession
of
the
central
authority
it
will
consider
the
other
states
as
subject
provinces
and
will
cause
its
own
supremacy
to
be
respected
under
the
borrowed
name
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
great
things
may
then
be
done
in
the
name
of
the
federal
government
but
in
reality
that
government
will
have
ceased
to
exist
in
both
these
cases
the
power
which
acts
in
the
name
of
the
confederation
becomes
stronger
the
more
it
abandons
the
natural
state
and
the
acknowledged
principles
of
confederations
in
america
the
existing
union
is
advantageous
to
all
the
states
but
it
is
not
indispensable
to
any
one
of
them
several
of
them
might
break
the
federal
tie
without
compromising
the
welfare
of
the
others
although
their
own
prosperity
would
be
lessened
as
the
existence
and
the
happiness
of
none
of
the
states
are
wholly
dependent
on
the
present
constitution
they
would
none
of
them
be
disposed
to
make
great
personal
sacrifices
to
maintain
it
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
state
which
seems
hitherto
to
have
its
ambition
much
interested
in
the
maintenance
of
the
existing
union
they
certainly
do
not
all
exercise
the
same
influence
in
the
federal
councils
but
no
one
of
them
can
hope
to
domineer
over
the
rest
or
to
treat
them
as
its
inferiors
or
as
its
subjects
it
appears
to
me
unquestionable
that
if
any
portion
of
the
union
seriously
desired
to
separate
itself
from
the
other
states
they
would
not
be
able
nor
indeed
would
they
attempt
to
prevent
it
and
that
the
present
union
will
only
last
as
long
as
the
states
which
compose
it
choose
to
continue
members
of
the
confederation
if
this
point
be
admitted
the
question
becomes
less
difficult
and
our
object
is
not
to
inquire
whether
the
states
of
the
existing
union
are
capable
of
separating
but
whether
they
will
choose
to
remain
united
the
remarks
respecting
the
inability
of
the
federal
government
to
retain
within
the
union
any
state
that
may
choose
to
withdraw
its
name
from
the
contract
ought
not
to
pass
through
an
american
edition
of
this
work
without
the
expression
of
a
dissent
by
the
editor
from
the
opinion
of
the
author
the
laws
of
the
united
states
must
remain
in
force
in
a
revolted
state
until
repealed
by
congress
the
customs
and
postages
must
be
collected
the
courts
of
the
united
states
must
sit
and
must
decide
the
causes
submitted
to
them
as
has
been
very
happily
explained
by
the
author
the
courts
act
upon
individuals
if
their
judgments
are
resisted
the
executive
arm
must
interpose
and
if
the
state
authorities
aid
in
the
resistance
the
military
power
of
the
whole
union
must
be
invoked
to
overcome
it
so
long
as
the
laws
affecting
the
citizens
of
such
a
state
remain
and
so
long
as
there
remain
any
officers
of
a
general
government
to
enforce
them
these
results
must
follow
not
only
theoretically
but
actually
the
author
probably
formed
the
opinions
which
are
the
subject
of
these
remarks
at
the
commencement
of
the
controversy
with
south
carolina
respecting
the
tariff
and
when
they
were
written
and
published
he
had
not
learned
the
result
of
that
controversy
in
which
the
supremacy
of
the
union
and
its
laws
was
triumphant
there
was
doubtless
great
reluctance
in
adopting
the
necessary
measures
to
collect
the
customs
and
to
bring
every
legal
question
that
could
possibly
arise
out
of
the
controversy
before
the
judiciary
of
the
united
states
but
they
were
finally
adopted
and
were
not
the
less
successful
for
being
the
result
of
deliberation
and
of
necessity
out
of
that
controversy
have
arisen
some
advantages
of
a
permanent
character
produced
by
the
legislation
which
it
required
there
were
defects
in
the
laws
regulating
the
manner
of
bringing
from
the
state
courts
into
those
of
the
united
states
a
cause
involving
the
constitutionality
of
acts
of
congress
or
of
the
states
through
which
the
federal
authority
might
be
evaded
those
defects
were
remedied
by
the
legislation
referred
to
and
it
is
now
more
emphatically
and
universally
true
than
when
the
author
wrote
that
the
acts
of
the
general
government
operate
through
the
judiciary
upon
individual
citizens
and
not
upon
the
among
the
various
reasons
which
tend
to
render
the
existing
union
useful
to
the
americans
two
principal
causes
are
peculiarly
evident
to
the
observer
although
the
americans
are
as
it
were
alone
upon
their
continent
their
commerce
makes
them
the
neighbors
of
all
the
nations
with
which
they
trade
notwithstanding
their
apparent
isolation
the
americans
require
a
certain
degree
of
strength
which
they
can
not
retain
otherwise
than
by
remaining
united
to
each
other
if
the
states
were
to
split
they
would
not
only
diminish
the
strength
which
they
are
now
able
to
display
toward
foreign
nations
but
they
would
soon
create
foreign
powers
upon
their
own
territory
a
system
of
inland
would
then
be
established
the
valleys
would
be
divided
by
imaginary
boundary
lines
the
courses
of
the
rivers
would
be
confined
by
territorial
distinctions
and
a
multitude
of
hindrances
would
prevent
the
americans
from
exploring
the
whole
of
that
vast
continent
which
providence
has
allotted
to
them
for
a
dominion
at
present
they
have
no
invasion
to
fear
and
consequently
no
standing
armies
to
maintain
no
taxes
to
levy
if
the
union
were
dissolved
all
these
burdensome
measures
might
ere
long
be
required
the
americans
are
then
very
powerfully
interested
in
the
maintenance
of
their
union
on
the
other
hand
it
is
almost
impossible
to
discover
any
sort
of
material
interest
which
might
at
present
tempt
a
portion
of
the
union
to
separate
from
the
other
states
when
we
cast
our
eyes
upon
the
map
of
the
united
states
we
perceive
the
chain
of
the
allegany
mountains
running
from
the
northeast
to
the
southwest
and
crossing
nearly
one
thousand
miles
of
country
and
we
are
led
to
imagine
that
the
design
of
providence
was
to
raise
between
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
the
coasts
of
the
atlantic
ocean
one
of
those
natural
barriers
which
break
the
mutual
intercourse
of
men
and
form
the
necessary
limits
of
different
states
but
the
average
height
of
the
alleganies
does
not
exceed
feet
their
greatest
elevation
is
not
above
feet
their
rounded
summits
and
the
spacious
valleys
which
they
conceal
within
their
passes
are
of
easy
access
from
several
sides
beside
which
the
principal
rivers
that
fall
into
the
atlantic
ocean
the
hudson
the
susquehannah
and
the
potomac
take
their
rise
beyond
the
alleganies
in
an
open
district
which
borders
upon
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
these
streams
quit
this
tract
of
country
make
their
way
through
the
barrier
which
would
seem
to
turn
them
westward
and
as
they
wind
through
the
mountains
they
open
an
easy
and
natural
passage
to
man
no
natural
barrier
exists
in
the
regions
which
are
now
inhabited
by
the
the
alleganies
are
so
far
from
serving
as
a
boundary
to
separate
nations
that
they
do
not
even
serve
as
a
frontier
to
the
states
new
york
pennsylvania
and
virginia
comprise
them
within
their
borders
and
extend
as
much
to
the
west
as
to
the
east
of
the
line
the
territory
now
occupied
by
the
states
of
the
union
and
the
three
great
districts
which
have
not
yet
acquired
the
rank
of
states
although
they
already
contain
inhabitants
covers
a
surface
of
square
miles
which
is
about
equal
to
five
times
the
extent
of
france
within
these
limits
the
qualities
of
the
soil
the
temperature
and
the
produce
of
the
country
are
extremely
various
the
vast
extent
of
territory
occupied
by
the
republics
has
given
rise
to
doubts
as
to
the
maintenance
of
the
union
here
a
distinction
must
be
made
contrary
interests
sometimes
arise
in
the
different
provinces
of
a
vast
empire
which
often
terminate
in
open
dissensions
and
the
extent
of
the
country
is
then
most
prejudicial
to
the
power
of
the
state
but
if
the
inhabitants
of
these
vast
regions
are
not
divided
by
contrary
interests
the
extent
of
the
territory
may
be
favorable
to
their
prosperity
for
the
unity
of
the
government
promotes
the
interchange
of
the
different
productions
of
the
soil
and
increases
their
value
by
facilitating
their
consumption
it
is
indeed
easy
to
discover
different
interests
in
the
different
parts
of
the
union
but
i
am
unacquainted
with
any
which
are
hostile
to
each
other
the
southern
states
are
almost
exclusively
agricultural
the
northern
states
are
more
peculiarly
commercial
and
manufacturing
the
states
of
the
west
are
at
the
same
time
agricultural
and
manufacturing
in
the
south
the
crops
consist
of
tobacco
of
rice
of
cotton
and
of
sugar
in
the
north
and
the
west
of
wheat
and
maize
these
are
different
sources
of
wealth
but
union
is
the
means
by
which
these
sources
are
opened
to
all
and
rendered
equally
advantageous
to
the
several
districts
the
north
which
ships
the
produce
of
the
to
all
parts
of
the
world
and
brings
back
the
produce
of
the
globe
to
the
union
is
evidently
interested
in
maintaining
the
confederation
in
its
present
condition
in
order
that
the
number
of
american
producers
and
consumers
may
remain
as
large
as
possible
the
north
is
the
most
natural
agent
of
communication
between
the
south
and
the
west
of
the
union
on
the
one
hand
and
the
rest
of
the
world
upon
the
other
the
north
is
therefore
interested
in
the
union
and
prosperity
of
the
south
and
the
west
in
order
that
they
may
continue
to
furnish
raw
materials
for
its
manufactures
and
cargoes
for
its
shipping
the
south
and
the
west
on
their
side
are
still
more
directly
interested
in
the
preservation
of
the
union
and
the
prosperity
of
the
north
the
produce
of
the
south
is
for
the
most
part
exported
beyond
seas
the
south
and
the
west
consequently
stand
in
need
of
the
commercial
resources
of
the
north
they
are
likewise
interested
in
the
maintenance
of
a
powerful
fleet
by
the
union
to
protect
them
efficaciously
the
south
and
the
west
have
no
vessels
but
they
can
not
refuse
a
willing
subsidy
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
navy
for
if
the
fleets
of
europe
were
to
blockade
the
ports
of
the
south
and
the
delta
of
the
mississippi
what
would
become
of
the
rice
of
the
carolinas
the
tobacco
of
virginia
and
the
sugar
and
cotton
which
grow
in
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
every
portion
of
the
federal
budget
does
therefore
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
material
interests
which
are
common
to
all
the
confederate
states
independently
of
this
commercial
utility
the
south
and
the
west
of
the
union
derive
great
political
advantages
from
their
connexion
with
the
north
the
south
contains
an
enormous
slave
population
a
population
which
is
already
alarming
and
still
more
formidable
for
the
future
the
states
of
the
west
lie
in
the
remoter
part
of
a
single
valley
and
all
the
rivers
which
intersect
their
territory
rise
in
the
rocky
mountains
or
in
the
alleganies
and
fall
into
the
mississippi
which
bears
them
onward
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
western
states
are
consequently
entirely
cut
off
by
their
position
from
the
traditions
of
europe
and
the
civilisation
of
the
old
world
the
inhabitants
of
the
south
then
are
induced
to
support
the
union
in
order
to
avail
themselves
of
its
protection
against
the
blacks
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
west
in
order
not
to
be
excluded
from
a
free
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
globe
and
shut
up
in
the
wilds
of
central
america
the
north
can
not
but
desire
the
maintenance
of
the
union
in
order
to
remain
as
it
now
is
the
connecting
link
between
that
vast
body
and
the
other
parts
of
the
world
the
temporal
interests
of
all
the
several
parts
of
the
union
are
then
intimately
connected
and
the
same
assertion
holds
true
respecting
those
opinions
and
sentiments
which
may
be
termed
the
immaterial
interests
of
men
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
talk
a
great
deal
of
their
attachment
to
their
country
but
i
confess
that
i
do
not
rely
upon
that
calculating
patriotism
which
is
founded
upon
interest
and
which
a
change
in
the
interest
at
stake
may
obliterate
nor
do
i
attach
much
importance
to
the
language
of
the
americans
when
they
manifest
in
their
daily
conversation
the
intention
of
maintaining
the
federal
system
adopted
by
their
forefathers
a
government
retains
its
sway
over
a
great
number
of
citizens
far
less
by
the
voluntary
and
rational
consent
of
the
multitude
than
by
that
instinctive
and
to
a
certain
extent
involuntary
agreement
which
results
from
similarity
of
feelings
and
resemblances
of
opinion
i
will
never
admit
that
men
constitute
a
social
body
simply
because
they
obey
the
same
head
and
the
same
laws
society
can
only
exist
when
a
great
number
of
men
consider
a
great
number
of
things
in
the
same
point
of
view
when
they
hold
the
same
opinions
upon
many
subjects
and
when
the
same
occurrences
suggest
the
same
thoughts
and
impressions
to
their
minds
the
observer
who
examines
the
present
condition
of
the
united
states
upon
this
principle
will
readily
discover
that
although
the
citizens
are
divided
into
distinct
sovereignties
they
nevertheless
constitute
a
single
people
and
he
may
perhaps
be
led
to
think
that
the
state
of
the
union
is
more
truly
a
state
of
society
than
that
of
certain
nations
of
europe
which
live
under
the
same
legislation
and
the
same
prince
although
the
have
several
religious
sects
they
all
regard
religion
in
the
same
manner
they
are
not
always
agreed
upon
the
measures
which
are
most
conducive
to
good
government
and
they
vary
upon
some
of
the
forms
of
government
which
it
is
expedient
to
adopt
but
they
are
unanimous
upon
the
general
principles
which
ought
to
rule
human
society
from
maine
to
the
floridas
and
from
missouri
to
the
atlantic
ocean
the
people
is
held
to
be
the
legitimate
source
of
all
power
the
same
notions
are
entertained
respecting
liberty
and
equality
the
liberty
of
the
press
the
right
of
association
the
jury
and
the
responsibility
of
the
agents
of
government
if
we
turn
from
their
political
and
religious
opinions
to
the
moral
and
philosophical
principles
which
regulate
the
daily
actions
of
life
and
govern
their
conduct
we
shall
still
find
the
same
uniformity
the
acknowledge
the
absolute
moral
authority
of
the
reason
of
the
community
as
they
acknowledge
the
political
authority
of
the
mass
of
citizens
and
they
hold
that
public
opinion
is
the
surest
arbiter
of
what
is
lawful
or
forbidden
true
or
false
the
majority
of
them
believe
that
a
man
will
be
led
to
do
what
is
just
and
good
by
following
his
own
interests
rightly
understood
they
hold
that
every
man
is
born
in
possession
of
the
right
of
and
that
no
one
has
the
right
of
constraining
his
to
be
happy
they
have
all
a
lively
faith
in
the
perfectibility
of
man
they
are
of
opinion
that
the
effects
of
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
must
necessarily
be
advantageous
and
the
consequences
of
ignorance
fatal
they
all
consider
society
as
a
body
in
a
state
of
improvement
humanity
as
a
changing
scene
in
which
nothing
is
or
ought
to
be
permanent
and
they
admit
that
what
appears
to
them
to
be
good
may
be
superseded
by
something
better
i
do
not
give
all
these
opinions
as
true
but
i
quote
them
as
characteristic
of
the
americans
the
are
not
only
united
together
by
those
common
opinions
but
they
are
separated
from
all
other
nations
by
a
common
feeling
of
pride
for
the
last
fifty
years
no
pains
have
been
spared
to
convince
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
that
they
constitute
the
only
religious
enlightened
and
free
people
they
perceive
that
for
the
present
their
own
democratic
institutions
succeed
while
those
of
other
countries
fail
hence
they
conceive
an
overweening
opinion
of
their
superiority
and
they
are
not
very
remote
from
believing
themselves
to
belong
to
a
distinct
race
of
mankind
the
dangers
which
threaten
the
american
union
do
not
originate
in
the
diversity
of
interests
or
opinions
but
in
the
various
characters
and
passions
of
the
americans
the
men
who
inhabit
the
vast
territory
of
the
united
states
are
almost
all
the
issue
of
a
common
stock
but
the
effects
of
the
climate
and
more
especially
of
slavery
have
gradually
introduced
very
striking
differences
between
the
british
settler
of
the
southern
states
and
the
british
settler
of
the
north
in
europe
it
is
generally
believed
that
slavery
has
rendered
the
interests
of
one
part
of
the
union
contrary
to
those
of
another
part
but
i
by
no
means
remarked
this
to
be
the
case
slavery
has
not
created
interests
in
the
south
contrary
to
those
of
the
north
but
it
has
modified
the
character
and
changed
the
habits
of
the
natives
of
the
south
i
have
already
explained
the
influence
which
slavery
has
exerted
upon
the
commercial
ability
of
the
americans
in
the
south
and
this
same
influence
equally
extends
to
their
manners
the
slave
is
a
servant
who
never
remonstrates
and
who
submits
to
everything
without
complaint
he
may
sometimes
assassinate
but
he
never
withstands
his
master
in
the
south
there
are
no
families
so
poor
as
not
to
have
slaves
the
citizen
of
the
southern
states
of
the
union
is
invested
with
a
sort
of
domestic
dictatorship
from
his
earliest
years
the
first
notion
he
acquires
in
life
is
that
he
is
born
to
command
and
the
first
habit
he
contracts
is
that
of
being
obeyed
without
resistance
his
education
tends
then
to
give
him
the
character
of
a
supercilious
and
a
hasty
man
irascible
violent
and
ardent
in
his
desires
impatient
of
obstacles
but
easily
discouraged
if
he
can
not
succeed
upon
his
first
attempt
the
american
of
the
northern
states
is
surrounded
by
no
slaves
in
his
childhood
he
is
even
unattended
by
free
servants
and
is
usually
obliged
to
provide
for
his
own
wants
no
sooner
does
he
enter
the
world
than
the
idea
of
necessity
assails
him
on
every
side
he
soon
learns
to
know
exactly
the
natural
limits
of
his
authority
he
never
expects
to
subdue
those
who
withstand
him
by
force
and
he
knows
that
the
surest
means
of
obtaining
the
support
of
his
is
to
win
their
favor
he
therefore
becomes
patient
reflecting
tolerant
slow
to
act
and
persevering
in
his
designs
in
the
southern
states
the
more
immediate
wants
of
life
are
always
supplied
the
inhabitants
of
those
parts
are
not
busied
in
the
material
cares
of
life
which
are
always
provided
for
by
others
and
their
imagination
is
diverted
to
more
captivating
and
less
definite
objects
the
american
of
the
south
is
fond
of
grandeur
luxury
and
renown
of
gaiety
of
pleasure
and
above
all
of
idleness
nothing
obliges
him
to
exert
himself
in
order
to
subsist
and
as
he
has
no
necessary
occupations
he
gives
way
to
indolence
and
does
not
even
attempt
what
would
be
useful
but
the
equality
of
fortunes
and
the
absence
of
slavery
in
the
north
plunge
the
inhabitants
in
those
same
cares
of
daily
life
which
are
disdained
by
the
white
population
of
the
south
they
are
taught
from
infancy
to
combat
want
and
to
place
comfort
above
all
the
pleasures
of
the
intellect
or
the
heart
the
imagination
is
extinguished
by
the
trivial
details
of
life
and
the
ideas
become
less
numerous
and
less
general
but
far
more
practical
and
more
precise
as
prosperity
is
the
sole
aim
of
exertion
it
is
excellently
well
attained
nature
and
mankind
are
turned
to
the
best
pecuniary
advantage
and
society
is
dexterously
made
to
contribute
to
the
welfare
of
each
of
its
members
while
individual
egotism
is
the
source
of
general
happiness
the
citizen
of
the
north
has
not
only
experience
but
knowledge
nevertheless
he
sets
but
little
value
upon
the
pleasures
of
knowledge
he
esteems
it
as
the
means
of
obtaining
a
certain
end
and
he
is
only
anxious
to
seize
its
more
lucrative
applications
the
citizen
of
the
south
is
more
given
to
act
upon
impulse
he
is
more
clever
more
frank
more
generous
more
intellectual
and
more
brilliant
the
former
with
a
greater
degree
of
activity
of
common
sense
of
information
and
of
general
aptitude
has
the
characteristic
good
and
evil
qualities
of
the
middle
classes
the
latter
has
the
tastes
the
prejudices
the
weaknesses
and
the
magnanimity
of
all
aristocracies
if
two
men
are
united
in
society
who
have
the
same
interests
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
same
opinions
but
different
characters
different
acquirements
and
a
different
style
of
civilisation
it
is
probable
that
these
men
will
not
agree
the
same
remark
is
applicable
to
a
society
of
nations
slavery
then
does
not
attack
the
american
union
directly
in
its
interests
but
indirectly
in
its
manners
the
states
which
gave
their
assent
to
the
federal
contract
in
were
thirteen
in
number
the
union
now
consists
of
members
the
population
which
amounted
to
nearly
four
millions
in
had
more
than
tripled
in
the
space
of
forty
years
and
in
it
amounted
to
nearly
thirteen
millions
changes
of
such
magnitude
can
not
take
place
without
some
danger
a
society
of
nations
as
well
as
a
society
of
individuals
derive
its
principal
chances
of
duration
from
the
wisdom
of
its
members
their
individual
weakness
and
their
limited
number
the
americans
who
quit
the
coasts
of
the
atlantic
ocean
to
plunge
into
the
western
wilderness
are
adventurers
impatient
of
restraint
greedy
of
wealth
and
frequently
men
expelled
from
the
states
in
which
they
were
born
when
they
arrive
in
the
deserts
they
are
unknown
to
each
other
and
they
have
neither
traditions
family
feeling
nor
the
force
of
example
to
check
their
excesses
the
empire
of
the
laws
is
feeble
among
them
that
of
morality
is
still
more
powerless
the
settlers
who
are
constantly
peopling
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
are
then
in
every
respect
inferior
to
the
americans
who
inhabit
the
older
parts
of
the
union
nevertheless
they
already
exercise
a
great
influence
in
its
councils
and
they
arrive
at
the
government
of
the
commonwealth
before
they
have
learned
to
govern
themselves
the
greater
the
individual
weakness
of
each
of
the
contracting
parties
the
greater
are
the
chances
of
the
duration
of
the
contract
for
their
safety
is
then
dependant
upon
their
union
when
in
the
most
populous
of
the
american
republics
did
not
contain
inhabitants
each
of
them
felt
its
own
insignificance
as
an
independent
people
and
this
feeling
rendered
compliance
with
the
federal
authority
more
easy
but
when
one
of
the
confederate
states
reckons
like
the
state
of
new
york
two
millions
of
inhabitants
and
covers
an
extent
of
territory
equal
in
surface
to
a
quarter
of
france
it
feels
its
own
strength
and
although
it
may
continue
to
support
the
union
as
advantageous
to
its
prosperity
it
no
longer
regards
that
body
as
necessary
to
its
existence
and
as
it
continues
to
belong
to
the
federal
compact
it
soon
aims
at
preponderance
in
the
federal
assemblies
the
probable
unanimity
of
the
states
is
diminished
as
their
number
increases
at
present
the
interests
of
the
different
parts
of
the
union
are
not
at
variance
but
who
is
able
to
foresee
the
multifarious
changes
of
the
future
in
a
country
in
which
towns
are
founded
from
day
to
day
and
states
almost
from
year
to
year
since
the
first
settlement
of
the
british
colonies
the
number
of
inhabitants
has
about
doubled
every
years
i
perceive
no
causes
which
are
likely
to
check
this
progressive
increase
of
the
population
for
the
next
hundred
years
and
before
that
space
of
time
has
elapsed
i
believe
that
the
territories
and
dependencies
of
the
united
states
will
be
covered
by
more
than
a
hundred
millions
of
inhabitants
and
divided
into
forty
states
i
admit
that
these
hundred
millions
of
men
have
no
hostile
interests
i
suppose
on
the
contrary
that
they
are
all
equally
interested
in
the
maintenance
of
the
union
but
i
am
still
of
opinion
that
where
there
are
a
hundred
millions
of
men
and
forty
distinct
nations
unequally
strong
the
continuance
of
the
federal
government
can
only
be
a
fortunate
accident
whatever
faith
i
may
have
in
the
perfectibility
of
man
until
human
nature
is
altered
and
men
wholly
transformed
i
shall
refuse
to
believe
in
the
duration
of
a
government
which
is
called
upon
to
hold
together
forty
different
peoples
disseminated
over
a
territory
equal
to
of
europe
in
extent
to
avoid
all
rivalry
ambition
and
struggles
between
them
and
to
direct
their
independent
activity
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
same
designs
but
the
greatest
peril
to
which
the
union
is
exposed
by
its
increase
arises
from
the
continual
changes
which
take
place
in
the
position
of
its
internal
strength
the
distance
from
lake
superior
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
extends
from
the
to
the
degree
of
latitude
a
distance
of
more
than
twelve
hundred
miles
as
the
bird
flies
the
frontier
of
the
united
states
winds
along
the
whole
of
this
immense
line
sometimes
falling
within
its
limits
but
more
frequently
extending
far
beyond
it
into
the
waste
it
has
been
calculated
that
the
whites
advance
a
mean
distance
of
seventeen
miles
along
the
whole
of
this
vast
boundary
obstacles
such
as
an
unproductive
district
a
lake
or
an
indian
nation
unexpectedly
encountered
are
sometimes
met
with
the
advancing
column
then
halts
for
a
while
its
two
extremities
fall
back
upon
themselves
and
as
soon
as
they
are
reunited
they
proceed
onward
this
gradual
and
continuous
progress
of
the
european
race
toward
the
rocky
mountains
has
the
solemnity
of
a
providential
event
it
is
like
a
deluge
of
men
rising
unabatedly
and
daily
driven
onward
by
the
hand
of
god
within
this
first
line
of
conquering
settlers
towns
are
built
and
vast
states
founded
in
there
were
only
a
few
thousand
pioneers
sprinkled
along
the
valleys
of
the
mississippi
and
at
the
present
day
these
valleys
contain
as
many
inhabitants
as
were
to
be
found
in
the
whole
union
in
their
population
amounts
to
nearly
four
millions
the
city
of
washington
was
founded
in
in
the
very
centre
of
the
union
but
such
are
the
changes
which
have
taken
place
that
it
now
stands
at
one
of
the
extremities
and
the
delegates
of
the
most
remote
western
states
are
already
obliged
to
perform
a
journey
as
long
as
that
from
vienna
to
paris
all
the
states
are
borne
onward
at
the
same
time
in
the
path
of
fortune
but
of
course
they
do
not
all
increase
and
prosper
in
the
same
proportion
in
the
north
of
the
union
detached
branches
of
the
allegany
chain
extending
as
far
as
the
atlantic
ocean
form
spacious
roads
and
ports
which
are
constantly
accessible
to
vessels
of
the
greatest
burden
but
from
the
potomac
to
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
the
coast
is
sandy
and
flat
in
this
part
of
the
union
the
mouths
of
almost
all
the
rivers
are
obstructed
and
the
few
harbors
which
exist
among
these
lagunes
afford
much
shallower
water
to
vessels
and
much
fewer
commercial
advantages
than
those
of
the
north
this
first
natural
cause
of
inferiority
is
united
to
another
cause
proceeding
from
the
laws
we
have
already
seen
that
slavery
which
is
abolished
in
the
north
still
exists
in
the
south
and
i
have
pointed
out
its
fatal
consequences
upon
the
prosperity
of
the
planter
himself
the
north
is
therefore
superior
to
the
south
both
in
commerce
and
manufacture
the
natural
consequence
of
which
is
the
more
rapid
increase
of
population
and
of
wealth
within
its
borders
the
states
situated
upon
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
ocean
are
already
most
of
the
land
is
held
by
an
owner
and
these
districts
can
not
therefore
receive
so
many
emigrants
as
the
western
states
where
a
boundless
field
is
still
open
to
their
exertions
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
is
far
more
fertile
than
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
ocean
this
reason
added
to
all
the
others
contributes
to
drive
the
europeans
westward
a
fact
which
may
be
rigorously
demonstrated
by
figures
it
is
found
that
the
sum
total
of
the
population
of
all
the
united
states
has
about
tripled
in
the
course
of
forty
years
but
in
the
recent
states
adjacent
to
the
mississippi
the
population
has
increased
fold
within
the
same
space
of
time
the
relative
position
of
the
central
federal
power
is
continually
displaced
forty
years
ago
the
majority
of
the
citizens
of
the
union
was
established
upon
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
in
the
environs
of
the
spot
upon
which
washington
now
stands
but
the
great
body
of
the
people
is
now
advancing
inland
and
to
the
north
so
that
in
twenty
years
the
majority
will
unquestionably
be
on
the
western
side
of
the
alleganies
if
the
union
goes
on
to
subsist
the
basin
of
the
mississippi
is
evidently
marked
out
by
its
fertility
and
its
extent
as
the
future
centre
of
the
federal
government
in
thirty
or
forty
years
that
tract
of
country
will
have
assumed
the
rank
which
naturally
belongs
to
it
it
is
easy
to
calculate
that
its
population
compared
to
that
of
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
will
be
in
round
numbers
as
to
in
a
few
years
the
states
which
founded
the
union
will
lose
the
direction
of
its
policy
and
the
population
of
the
valleys
of
the
mississippi
will
preponderate
in
the
federal
assemblies
this
constant
gravitation
of
the
federal
power
and
influence
toward
the
northwest
is
shown
every
ten
years
when
a
general
census
of
the
population
is
made
and
the
number
of
delegates
which
each
state
sends
to
congress
is
settled
afresh
in
virginia
had
nineteen
representatives
in
congress
this
number
continued
to
increase
until
the
year
when
it
reached
to
from
that
time
it
began
to
decrease
and
in
virginia
elected
only
representatives
during
the
same
period
the
state
of
new
york
advanced
in
the
contrary
direction
in
it
had
ten
representatives
in
congress
in
in
and
in
forty
the
state
of
ohio
had
only
one
representative
in
and
in
it
had
already
nineteen
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
durable
union
of
a
people
which
is
rich
and
strong
with
one
which
is
poor
and
weak
and
if
it
were
proved
that
the
strength
and
wealth
of
the
one
are
not
the
causes
of
the
weakness
and
poverty
of
the
other
but
union
is
still
move
difficult
to
maintain
at
a
time
at
which
one
party
is
losing
strength
and
the
other
is
gaining
it
this
rapid
and
disproportionate
increase
of
certain
states
threatens
the
independence
of
the
others
new
york
might
perhaps
succeed
with
its
two
millions
of
inhabitants
and
its
forty
representatives
in
dictating
to
the
other
states
in
congress
but
even
if
the
more
powerful
states
make
no
attempt
to
bear
down
the
lesser
ones
the
danger
still
exists
for
there
is
almost
as
much
in
the
possibility
of
the
act
as
in
the
act
itself
the
weak
generally
mistrusts
the
justice
and
the
reason
of
the
strong
the
states
which
increase
less
rapidily
than
the
others
look
upon
those
which
are
more
favored
by
fortune
with
envy
and
suspicion
hence
arise
the
uneasiness
and
agitation
which
are
observable
in
the
south
and
which
form
so
striking
a
contrast
to
the
confidence
and
prosperity
which
are
common
to
other
parts
of
the
union
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
hostile
measures
taken
by
the
southern
provinces
upon
a
recent
occasion
are
attributable
to
no
other
cause
the
inhabitants
of
the
southern
states
are
of
all
the
americans
those
who
are
most
interested
in
the
maintenance
of
the
union
they
would
assuredly
suffer
most
from
being
left
to
themselves
and
yet
they
are
the
only
citizens
who
threaten
to
break
the
tie
of
confederation
but
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
the
south
which
has
given
four
presidents
washington
jefferson
madison
and
monroe
to
the
union
which
perceives
that
it
is
losing
its
federal
influence
and
that
the
number
of
its
representatives
in
congress
is
diminishing
from
year
to
year
while
those
of
the
northern
and
western
states
are
increasing
the
south
which
is
peopled
with
ardent
and
irascible
beings
is
becoming
more
and
more
irritated
and
alarmed
the
citizens
reflect
upon
their
present
position
and
remember
their
past
influence
with
the
melancholy
uneasiness
of
men
who
suspect
oppression
if
they
discover
a
law
of
the
union
which
is
not
unequivocally
favorable
to
their
interests
they
protest
against
it
as
an
abuse
of
force
and
if
their
ardent
remonstrances
are
not
listened
to
they
threaten
to
quit
an
association
which
loads
them
with
burdens
while
it
deprives
them
of
their
due
profits
the
tariff
said
the
inhabitants
of
carolina
in
enriches
the
north
and
ruins
the
south
for
if
this
were
not
the
case
to
what
can
we
attribute
the
continually
increasing
power
and
wealth
of
the
north
with
its
inclement
skies
and
arid
soil
while
the
south
which
may
be
styled
the
garden
of
america
is
rapidly
declining
if
the
changes
which
i
have
described
were
gradual
so
that
each
generation
at
least
might
have
time
to
disappear
with
the
order
of
things
under
which
it
had
lived
the
danger
would
be
less
but
the
progress
of
society
in
america
is
precipitate
and
almost
revolutionary
the
same
citizen
may
have
lived
to
see
his
state
take
the
lead
in
the
union
and
afterward
become
powerless
in
the
federal
assemblies
and
an
republic
has
been
known
to
grow
as
rapidly
as
a
man
passing
from
birth
and
infancy
to
maturity
in
the
course
of
thirty
years
it
must
not
be
imagined
however
that
the
states
which
lose
their
preponderance
also
lose
their
population
or
their
riches
no
stop
is
put
to
their
prosperity
and
they
even
go
on
to
increase
more
rapidly
than
any
kingdom
in
europe
but
they
believe
themselves
to
be
impoverished
because
their
wealth
does
not
augment
as
rapidly
as
that
of
their
neighbors
and
they
think
that
their
power
is
lost
because
they
suddenly
come
into
collision
with
a
power
greater
than
their
own
thus
they
are
more
hurt
in
their
feelings
and
their
passions
than
in
their
interests
but
this
is
amply
sufficient
to
endanger
the
maintenance
of
the
union
if
kings
and
peoples
had
only
had
their
true
interests
in
view
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
the
name
of
war
would
scarcely
be
known
among
mankind
thus
the
prosperity
of
the
united
states
is
the
source
of
the
most
serious
dangers
that
threaten
them
since
it
tends
to
create
in
some
of
the
confederate
states
that
which
accompanies
a
rapid
increase
of
fortune
and
to
awaken
in
others
those
feelings
of
envy
mistrust
and
regret
which
usually
attend
upon
the
loss
of
it
the
americans
contemplate
this
extraordinary
and
hasty
progress
with
exultation
but
they
would
be
wiser
to
consider
it
with
sorrow
and
alarm
the
americans
of
the
united
states
must
inevitably
become
one
of
the
greatest
nations
in
the
world
their
offset
will
cover
almost
the
whole
of
north
america
the
continent
which
they
inhabit
is
their
dominion
and
it
can
not
escape
them
what
urges
them
to
take
possession
of
it
so
soon
riches
power
and
renown
can
not
fail
to
be
theirs
at
some
future
time
but
they
rush
upon
their
fortune
as
if
but
a
moment
remained
for
them
to
make
it
their
own
i
think
i
have
demonstrated
that
the
existence
of
the
present
confederation
depends
entirely
on
the
continued
assent
of
all
the
confederates
and
starting
from
this
principle
i
have
inquired
into
the
causes
which
may
induce
any
of
the
states
to
separate
from
the
others
the
union
may
however
perish
in
two
different
ways
one
of
the
confederate
states
may
choose
to
retire
from
the
compact
and
so
forcibly
sever
the
federal
tie
and
it
is
to
this
supposition
that
most
of
the
remarks
which
i
have
made
apply
or
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
may
be
progressively
intrenched
on
by
the
simultaneous
tendency
of
the
united
republics
to
resume
their
independence
the
central
power
successively
stripped
of
all
its
prerogatives
and
reduced
to
impotence
by
tacit
consent
would
become
incompetent
to
fulfil
its
purpose
and
the
second
union
would
perish
like
the
first
by
a
sort
of
senile
inaptitude
the
gradual
weakening
of
the
federal
tie
which
may
finally
lead
to
the
dissolution
of
the
union
is
a
distinct
circumstance
that
may
produce
a
variety
of
minor
consequences
before
it
operates
so
violent
a
change
the
confederation
might
still
subsist
although
its
government
were
reduced
to
such
a
degree
of
inanition
as
to
paralyze
the
nation
to
cause
internal
anarchy
and
to
check
the
general
prosperity
of
the
country
after
having
investigated
the
causes
which
may
induce
the
to
disunite
it
is
important
to
inquire
whether
if
the
union
continues
to
subsist
their
government
will
extend
or
contract
its
sphere
of
action
and
whether
it
will
become
more
energetic
or
more
weak
the
americans
are
evidently
disposed
to
look
upon
their
future
condition
with
alarm
they
perceive
that
in
most
of
the
nations
of
the
world
the
exercise
of
the
rights
of
sovereignty
tends
to
fall
under
the
control
of
a
few
individuals
and
they
are
dismayed
by
the
idea
that
such
will
also
be
the
case
in
their
own
country
even
the
statesmen
feel
or
affect
to
feel
these
fears
for
in
america
centralization
is
by
no
means
popular
and
there
is
no
surer
means
of
courting
the
majority
than
by
inveighing
against
the
encroachments
of
the
central
power
the
americans
do
not
perceive
that
the
countries
in
which
this
alarming
tendency
to
centralization
exists
are
inhabited
by
a
single
people
while
the
fact
of
the
union
being
composed
of
different
confederate
communities
is
sufficient
to
baffle
all
the
inferences
which
might
be
drawn
from
analogous
circumstances
i
confess
that
i
am
inclined
to
consider
the
fears
of
a
great
number
of
americans
as
purely
imaginary
and
far
from
participating
in
their
dread
of
the
consolidation
of
power
in
the
hands
of
the
union
i
think
that
the
federal
government
is
visibly
losing
strength
to
prove
this
assertion
i
shall
not
have
recourse
to
any
remote
occurrences
but
to
circumstances
which
i
have
myself
observed
and
which
belong
to
our
own
time
an
attentive
examination
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
united
states
will
easily
convince
us
that
two
opposite
tendencies
exist
in
that
country
like
two
distinct
currents
flowing
in
contrary
directions
in
the
same
channel
the
union
has
now
existed
for
years
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
a
vast
number
of
provincial
prejudices
which
were
at
first
hostile
to
its
power
have
died
away
the
patriotic
feeling
which
attached
each
of
the
americans
to
his
own
native
state
is
become
less
exclusive
and
the
different
parts
of
the
union
have
become
more
intimately
connected
the
better
they
have
become
acquainted
with
each
other
the
post
that
great
instrument
of
intellectual
intercourse
now
reaches
into
the
backwoods
and
steamboats
have
established
daily
means
of
communication
between
the
different
points
of
the
coast
an
inland
navigation
of
unexampled
rapidity
conveys
commodities
up
and
down
the
rivers
of
the
country
and
to
these
facilities
of
nature
and
art
may
be
added
those
restless
cravings
that
busymindedness
and
love
of
self
which
are
constantly
urging
the
american
into
active
life
and
bringing
him
into
contact
with
his
he
crosses
the
country
in
every
direction
he
visits
all
the
various
populations
of
the
land
and
there
is
not
a
province
in
france
in
which
the
natives
are
so
well
known
to
each
other
as
the
thirteen
millions
of
men
who
cover
the
territory
of
the
united
states
but
while
the
americans
intermingle
they
grow
in
resemblance
of
each
other
the
differences
resulting
from
their
climate
their
origin
and
their
institutions
diminish
and
they
all
draw
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
common
type
every
year
thousands
of
men
leave
the
north
to
settle
in
different
parts
of
the
union
they
bring
with
them
their
faith
their
opinions
and
their
manners
and
as
they
are
more
enlightened
than
the
men
among
whom
they
are
about
to
dwell
they
soon
rise
to
the
head
of
affairs
and
they
adapt
society
to
their
own
advantage
this
continual
emigration
of
the
north
to
the
south
is
peculiarly
favorable
to
the
fusion
of
all
the
different
provincial
characters
into
one
national
character
the
civilisation
of
the
north
appears
to
be
the
common
standard
to
which
the
whole
nation
will
one
day
be
assimilated
the
commercial
ties
which
unite
the
confederate
states
are
strengthened
by
the
increasing
manufactures
of
the
americans
and
the
union
which
began
to
exist
in
their
opinions
gradually
forms
a
part
of
their
habits
the
course
of
time
has
swept
away
the
bugbear
thoughts
which
haunted
the
imaginations
of
the
citizens
in
the
federal
power
is
not
become
oppressive
it
has
not
destroyed
the
independence
of
the
states
it
has
not
subjected
the
confederates
to
monarchical
institutions
and
the
union
has
not
rendered
the
lesser
states
dependant
upon
the
larger
ones
but
the
confederation
has
continued
to
increase
in
population
in
wealth
and
in
power
i
am
therefore
convinced
that
the
natural
obstacles
to
the
continuance
of
the
american
union
are
not
so
powerful
at
the
present
time
as
they
were
in
and
that
the
enemies
of
the
union
are
not
so
numerous
nevertheless
a
careful
examination
of
the
history
of
the
united
states
for
the
last
years
will
readily
convince
us
that
the
federal
power
is
declining
nor
is
it
difficult
to
explain
the
causes
of
this
phenomenon
when
the
constitution
of
was
promulgated
the
nation
was
a
prey
to
anarchy
the
union
which
succeeded
this
confusion
excited
much
dread
and
much
animosity
but
it
was
warmly
supported
because
it
satisfied
an
imperious
want
thus
although
it
was
more
attacked
than
it
is
now
the
federal
power
soon
reached
the
maximum
of
its
authority
as
is
usually
the
case
with
a
government
which
triumphs
after
having
braced
its
strength
by
the
struggle
at
that
time
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
seemed
to
extend
rather
than
to
repress
the
federal
sovereignty
and
the
union
offered
in
several
respects
the
appearance
of
a
single
and
undivided
people
directed
in
its
foreign
and
internal
policy
by
a
single
government
but
to
attain
this
point
the
people
had
risen
to
a
certain
extent
above
itself
the
constitution
had
not
destroyed
the
distinct
sovereignty
of
the
states
and
all
communities
of
whatever
nature
they
may
be
are
impelled
by
a
secret
propensity
to
assert
their
independence
this
propensity
is
still
more
decided
in
a
country
like
america
in
which
every
village
forms
a
sort
of
republic
accustomed
to
conduct
its
own
affairs
it
therefore
cost
the
states
an
effort
to
submit
to
the
federal
supremacy
and
all
efforts
however
successful
they
may
be
necessarily
subside
with
the
causes
in
which
they
originated
as
the
federal
government
consolidated
its
authority
america
resumed
its
rank
among
the
nations
peace
returned
to
its
frontiers
and
public
credit
was
restored
confusion
was
succeeded
by
a
fixed
state
of
things
which
was
favorable
to
the
full
and
free
exercise
of
industrious
enterprise
it
was
this
very
prosperity
which
made
the
americans
forget
the
cause
to
which
it
was
attributable
and
when
once
the
danger
was
passed
the
energy
and
the
patriotism
which
had
enabled
them
to
brave
it
disappeared
from
among
them
no
sooner
were
they
delivered
from
the
cares
which
oppressed
them
than
they
easily
returned
to
their
ordinary
habits
and
gave
themselves
up
without
resistance
to
their
natural
inclinations
when
a
powerful
government
no
longer
appeared
to
be
necessary
they
once
more
began
to
think
it
irksome
the
union
encouraged
a
general
prosperity
and
the
states
were
not
inclined
to
abandon
the
union
but
they
desired
to
render
the
action
of
the
power
which
represented
that
body
as
light
as
possible
the
general
principle
of
union
was
adopted
but
in
every
minor
detail
there
was
an
actual
tendency
to
independence
the
principle
of
confederation
was
every
day
more
easily
admitted
and
more
rarely
applied
so
that
the
federal
government
brought
about
its
own
decline
while
it
was
creating
order
and
peace
as
soon
as
this
tendency
of
public
opinion
began
to
be
manifested
externally
the
leaders
of
parties
who
live
by
the
passions
of
the
people
began
to
work
it
to
their
own
advantage
the
position
of
the
federal
government
then
became
exceedingly
critical
its
enemies
were
in
possession
of
the
popular
favor
and
they
obtained
the
right
of
conducting
its
policy
by
pledging
themselves
to
lessen
its
influence
from
that
time
forward
the
government
of
the
union
has
invariably
been
obliged
to
recede
as
often
as
it
has
attempted
to
enter
the
lists
with
the
government
of
the
states
and
whenever
an
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
the
federal
constitution
has
been
called
for
that
interpretation
has
most
frequently
been
opposed
to
the
union
and
favorable
to
the
states
the
constitution
invested
the
federal
government
with
the
right
of
providing
for
the
interests
of
the
nation
and
it
has
been
held
that
no
other
authority
was
so
fit
to
superintend
the
internal
improvements
which
affected
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
union
such
for
instance
as
the
cutting
of
canals
but
the
states
were
alarmed
at
a
power
distinct
from
their
own
which
could
thus
dispose
of
a
portion
of
their
territory
and
they
were
afraid
that
the
central
government
would
by
this
means
acquire
a
formidable
extent
of
patronage
within
their
own
confines
and
exercise
a
degree
of
influence
which
they
intended
to
reserve
exclusively
to
their
own
agents
the
democratic
party
which
has
constantly
been
opposed
to
the
increase
of
the
federal
authority
then
accused
the
congress
of
usurpation
and
the
chief
magistrate
of
ambition
the
central
government
was
intimidated
by
the
opposition
and
it
soon
acknowledged
its
error
promising
exactly
to
confine
its
influence
for
the
future
within
the
circle
which
was
prescribed
to
it
the
constitution
confers
upon
the
union
the
right
of
treating
with
foreign
nations
the
indian
tribes
which
border
upon
the
frontiers
of
the
united
states
have
usually
been
regarded
in
this
light
as
long
as
these
savages
consented
to
retire
before
the
civilized
settlers
the
federal
right
was
not
contested
but
as
soon
as
an
indian
tribe
attempted
to
fix
its
dwelling
upon
a
given
spot
the
adjacent
states
claimed
possession
of
the
lands
and
the
rights
of
sovereignty
over
the
natives
the
central
government
soon
recognized
both
these
claims
and
after
it
had
concluded
treaties
with
the
indians
as
independent
nations
it
gave
them
up
as
subjects
to
the
legislative
tyranny
of
the
states
some
of
the
states
which
had
been
founded
upon
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
extended
indefinitely
to
the
west
into
wild
regions
where
no
european
had
ever
penetrated
the
states
whose
confines
were
irrevocably
fixed
looked
with
a
jealous
eye
upon
the
unbounded
regions
which
the
future
would
enable
their
neighbors
to
explore
the
latter
then
agreed
with
a
view
to
conciliate
the
others
and
to
facilitate
the
act
of
union
to
lay
down
their
own
boundaries
and
to
abandon
all
the
territory
which
lay
beyond
those
limits
to
the
confederation
at
large
thenceforward
the
federal
government
became
the
owner
of
all
the
uncultivated
lands
which
lie
beyond
the
borders
of
the
thirteen
states
first
confederated
it
was
invested
with
the
right
of
parcelling
and
selling
them
and
the
sums
derived
from
this
source
were
exclusively
reserved
to
the
public
treasury
of
the
union
in
order
to
furnish
supplies
for
purchasing
tracts
of
country
from
the
indians
for
opening
roads
to
the
remote
settlements
and
for
accelerating
the
increase
of
civilisation
as
much
as
possible
new
states
have
however
been
formed
in
the
course
of
time
in
the
midst
of
those
wilds
which
were
formerly
ceded
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
congress
has
gone
on
to
sell
for
the
profit
of
the
nation
at
large
the
uncultivated
lands
which
those
new
states
contained
but
the
latter
at
length
asserted
that
as
they
were
now
fully
constituted
they
ought
to
enjoy
the
exclusive
right
of
converting
the
produce
of
these
sales
to
their
own
use
as
their
remonstrances
became
more
and
more
threatening
congress
thought
fit
to
deprive
the
union
of
a
portion
of
the
privileges
which
it
had
hitherto
enjoyed
and
at
the
end
of
it
passed
a
law
by
which
the
greatest
part
of
the
revenue
derived
from
the
sale
of
lands
was
made
over
to
the
new
western
republics
although
the
lands
themselves
were
not
ceded
to
them
the
remark
of
the
author
that
whenever
an
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
the
federal
constitution
has
been
called
for
that
interpretation
has
most
frequently
been
opposed
to
the
union
and
favorable
to
the
states
requires
considerable
qualification
the
instances
which
the
author
cites
are
those
of
interpretations
not
those
made
by
the
judiciary
it
may
be
questioned
whether
any
of
those
cited
by
him
are
fair
instances
of
although
the
then
president
and
many
of
his
friends
doubted
or
denied
the
power
of
congress
over
many
of
the
subjects
mentioned
by
the
author
yet
the
omission
to
exercise
the
power
thus
questioned
did
not
proceed
wholly
from
doubts
of
the
constitutional
authority
it
must
be
remembered
that
all
these
questions
affected
local
interests
of
the
states
or
districts
represented
in
congress
and
the
author
has
elsewhere
shown
the
tendency
of
the
local
feeling
to
overcome
all
regard
for
the
abstract
interest
of
the
union
hence
many
members
have
voted
on
these
questions
without
reference
to
the
constitutional
question
and
indeed
without
entertaining
any
doubt
of
their
power
these
instances
may
afford
proof
that
the
federal
power
is
declining
as
the
author
contends
but
they
do
not
prove
any
actual
interpretation
of
the
constitution
and
so
numerous
and
various
are
the
circumstances
to
influence
the
decision
of
a
legislative
body
like
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
the
people
do
not
regard
them
as
sound
and
authoritative
expositions
of
the
true
sense
of
the
constitution
except
perhaps
in
those
very
few
cases
where
there
has
been
a
constant
and
uninterrupted
practice
from
the
organization
of
the
government
the
judiciary
is
looked
to
as
the
only
authentic
expounder
of
the
constitution
and
until
a
law
of
congress
has
passed
that
ordeal
its
constitutionality
is
open
to
question
of
which
our
history
furnishes
many
examples
there
are
errors
in
some
of
the
instances
given
by
our
author
which
would
materially
mislead
if
not
corrected
that
in
relation
to
the
indians
proceeds
upon
the
assumption
that
the
united
states
claimed
some
rights
over
indians
or
the
territory
occupied
by
them
inconsistent
with
the
claims
of
the
states
but
this
is
a
mistake
as
to
their
lands
the
united
states
never
pretended
to
any
right
in
them
except
such
as
was
granted
by
the
cessions
of
the
states
the
principle
universally
acknowledged
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
several
states
is
that
by
the
treaty
with
great
britain
in
which
the
independence
of
the
colonies
was
acknowledged
the
states
became
severally
and
individually
independent
and
as
such
succeeded
to
the
rights
of
the
crown
of
england
to
and
over
the
lands
within
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
states
the
right
of
the
crown
in
these
lands
was
the
absolute
ownership
subject
only
to
the
rights
of
occupancy
by
the
indians
so
long
as
they
remained
a
tribe
this
right
devolved
to
each
state
by
the
treaty
which
established
their
independence
and
the
united
states
have
never
questioned
it
see
cranch
wheaton
johnson
reports
on
the
other
hand
the
right
of
holding
treaties
with
the
indians
has
universally
been
conceded
to
the
united
states
the
right
of
a
state
to
the
lands
occupied
by
the
indians
within
the
boundaries
of
such
state
does
not
in
the
least
conflict
with
the
right
of
holding
treaties
on
national
subjects
by
the
united
states
with
those
indians
with
respect
to
indians
residing
in
any
territory
the
boundaries
of
any
state
or
on
lands
ceded
to
the
united
states
the
case
is
different
the
united
states
are
in
such
cases
the
proprietors
of
the
soil
subject
to
the
indian
right
of
occupancy
and
when
that
right
is
extinguished
the
proprietorship
becomes
absolute
it
will
be
seen
then
that
in
relation
to
the
indians
and
their
lands
no
question
could
arise
respecting
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
the
observation
that
as
soon
as
an
indian
tribe
attempted
to
fix
its
dwelling
upon
a
given
spot
the
adjacent
states
claimed
possession
of
the
lands
and
the
rights
of
sovereignty
over
the
natives
is
a
strange
compound
of
error
and
of
truth
as
above
remarked
the
indian
right
of
occupancy
has
ever
been
recognized
by
the
states
with
the
exception
of
the
case
referred
to
by
the
author
in
which
georgia
claimed
the
right
to
possess
certain
lands
occupied
by
the
cherokees
this
was
anomalous
and
grew
out
of
treaties
and
cessions
the
details
of
which
are
too
numerous
and
complicated
for
the
limits
of
a
note
but
in
no
other
cases
have
the
states
ever
claimed
the
possession
of
lands
occupied
by
indians
without
having
previously
extinguished
their
right
by
purchase
as
to
the
rights
of
sovereignty
over
the
natives
the
principle
admitted
in
the
united
states
is
that
all
persons
within
the
territorial
limits
of
a
state
are
and
of
necessity
must
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
its
laws
while
the
indian
tribes
were
numerous
distinct
and
separate
from
the
whites
and
possessed
a
government
of
their
own
the
state
authorities
from
considerations
of
policy
abstained
from
the
exercise
of
criminal
jurisdiction
for
offences
committed
by
the
indians
among
themselves
although
for
offences
against
the
whites
they
were
subjected
to
the
operation
of
the
state
laws
but
as
these
tribes
diminished
in
numbers
as
those
who
remained
among
them
became
enervated
by
bad
habits
and
ceased
to
exercise
any
effectual
government
humanity
demanded
that
the
power
of
the
states
should
be
interposed
to
protect
the
miserable
remnants
from
the
violence
and
outrage
of
each
other
the
first
recorded
instance
of
interposition
in
such
a
case
was
in
when
an
indian
of
the
seneca
tribe
in
the
state
of
new
york
was
tried
and
convicted
of
murder
on
a
squaw
of
the
tribe
the
courts
declared
their
competency
to
take
cognizance
of
such
offences
and
the
legislature
confirmed
the
declaration
by
a
another
instance
of
what
the
author
calls
interpretation
of
the
constitution
against
the
general
government
is
given
by
him
in
the
proposed
act
of
which
passed
both
houses
of
congress
but
was
vetoed
by
the
president
by
which
as
he
says
the
greatest
part
of
the
revenue
derived
from
the
sale
of
lands
was
made
over
to
the
new
western
republics
but
this
act
was
not
founded
on
any
doubt
of
the
title
of
the
united
states
to
the
lands
in
question
or
of
its
constitutional
power
over
them
and
can
not
be
cited
as
any
evidence
of
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
an
error
of
fact
in
this
statement
ought
to
be
corrected
the
bill
to
which
the
author
refers
is
doubtless
that
usually
called
clay
land
bill
instead
of
making
over
the
greatest
part
of
the
revenue
to
the
new
states
it
appropriated
twelve
and
a
half
per
cent
to
them
in
addition
to
five
per
cent
which
had
been
originally
granted
for
the
purpose
of
making

the
slightest
observation
in
the
united
states
enables
one
to
appreciate
the
advantages
which
the
country
derives
from
the
bank
these
advantages
are
of
several
kinds
but
one
of
them
is
peculiarly
striking
to
the
stranger
the
of
the
united
states
are
taken
upon
the
borders
of
the
desert
for
the
same
value
as
at
philadelphia
where
the
bank
conducts
its
operations
the
bank
of
the
united
states
is
nevertheless
an
object
of
great
animosity
its
directors
have
proclaimed
their
hostility
to
the
president
and
they
are
accused
not
without
some
show
of
probability
of
having
abused
their
influence
to
thwart
his
election
the
president
therefore
attacks
the
establishment
which
they
represent
with
all
the
warmth
of
personal
enmity
and
he
is
encouraged
in
the
pursuit
of
his
revenge
by
the
conviction
that
he
is
supported
by
the
secret
propensities
of
the
majority
the
bank
may
be
regarded
as
the
great
monetary
tie
of
the
union
just
as
congress
is
the
great
legislative
tie
and
the
same
passions
which
tend
to
render
the
states
independent
of
the
central
power
contribute
to
the
overthrow
of
the
bank
the
bank
of
the
united
states
always
holds
a
great
number
of
the
notes
issued
by
the
provincial
banks
which
it
can
at
any
time
oblige
them
to
convert
into
cash
it
has
itself
nothing
to
fear
from
a
similar
demand
as
the
extent
of
its
resources
enables
it
to
meet
all
claims
but
the
existence
of
the
provincial
banks
is
thus
threatened
and
their
operations
are
restricted
since
they
are
only
able
to
issue
a
quantity
of
notes
duly
proportioned
to
their
capital
they
submit
with
impatience
to
this
salutary
control
the
newspapers
which
they
have
bought
over
and
the
president
whose
interest
renders
him
their
instrument
attack
the
bank
with
the
greatest
vehemence
they
rouse
the
local
passions
and
the
blind
democratic
instinct
of
the
country
to
aid
their
cause
and
they
assert
that
the
form
a
permanent
aristocratic
body
whose
influence
must
ultimately
be
felt
in
the
government
and
must
affect
those
principles
of
equality
upon
which
society
rests
in
america
the
contest
between
the
bank
and
its
opponents
is
only
an
incident
in
the
great
struggle
which
is
going
on
in
america
between
the
provinces
and
the
central
power
between
the
spirit
of
democratic
independence
and
the
spirit
of
gradation
and
subordination
i
do
not
mean
that
the
enemies
of
the
bank
are
identically
the
same
individuals
who
on
other
points
attack
the
federal
government
but
i
assert
that
the
attacks
directed
against
the
bank
of
the
united
states
originate
in
the
propensities
which
militate
against
the
federal
government
and
that
the
very
numerous
opponents
of
the
former
afford
a
deplorable
symptom
of
the
decreasing
support
of
the
latter
the
union
has
never
displayed
so
much
weakness
as
in
the
celebrated
question
of
the
tariff
the
wars
of
the
french
revolution
and
of
had
created
manufacturing
establishments
in
the
north
of
the
union
by
cutting
off
all
free
communication
between
america
and
europe
when
peace
was
concluded
and
the
channel
of
intercourse
reopened
by
which
the
produce
of
europe
was
transmitted
to
the
new
world
the
americans
thought
fit
to
establish
a
system
of
import
duties
for
the
twofold
purpose
of
protecting
their
incipient
manufactures
and
of
paying
off
the
amount
of
the
debt
contracted
during
the
war
the
southern
states
which
have
no
manufactures
to
encourage
and
which
are
exclusively
agricultural
soon
complained
of
this
measure
such
were
the
simple
facts
and
i
do
not
pretend
to
examine
in
this
place
whether
their
complaints
were
well
founded
or
unjust
as
early
as
the
year
south
carolina
declared
in
a
petition
to
congress
that
the
tariff
was
unconstitutional
oppressive
and
unjust
and
the
states
of
georgia
virginia
north
carolina
alabama
and
mississippi
subsequently
remonstrated
against
it
with
more
or
less
vigor
but
congress
far
from
lending
an
ear
to
these
complaints
raised
the
scale
of
tariff
duties
in
the
years
and
and
recognized
anew
the
principle
on
which
it
was
founded
a
doctrine
was
then
proclaimed
or
rather
revived
in
the
south
which
took
the
name
of
nullification
i
have
shown
in
the
proper
place
that
the
object
of
the
federal
constitution
was
not
to
form
a
league
but
to
create
a
national
government
the
americans
of
the
united
states
form
a
sole
and
undivided
people
in
all
the
cases
which
are
specified
by
that
constitution
and
upon
these
points
the
will
of
the
nation
is
expressed
as
it
is
in
all
constitutional
nations
by
the
voice
of
the
majority
when
the
majority
has
pronounced
its
decision
it
is
the
duty
of
the
minority
to
submit
such
is
the
sound
legal
doctrine
and
the
only
one
which
agrees
with
the
text
of
the
constitution
and
the
known
intention
of
those
who
framed
it
the
partisans
of
nullification
in
the
south
maintain
on
the
contrary
that
the
intention
of
the
americans
in
uniting
was
not
to
reduce
themselves
to
the
condition
of
one
and
the
same
people
that
they
meant
to
constitute
a
league
of
independent
states
and
that
each
state
consequently
retains
its
entire
sovereignty
if
not
at
least
and
has
the
right
of
putting
its
own
construction
upon
the
laws
of
congress
and
of
suspending
their
execution
within
the
limits
of
its
own
territory
if
they
are
held
to
be
unconstitutional
or
unjust
the
entire
doctrine
of
nullification
is
comprised
in
a
sentence
uttered
by
calhoun
the
head
of
that
party
in
the
south
before
the
senate
of
the
united
states
in
the
year
the
constitution
is
a
compact
to
which
the
states
were
parties
in
their
sovereign
capacity
now
whenever
a
contract
is
entered
into
by
parties
which
acknowledge
no
tribunal
above
their
authority
to
decide
in
the
last
resort
each
of
them
has
a
right
to
judge
for
himself
in
relation
to
the
nature
extent
and
obligations
of
the
instrument
it
is
evident
that
a
similar
doctrine
destroys
the
very
basis
of
the
federal
constitution
and
brings
back
all
the
evils
of
the
old
confederation
from
which
the
americans
were
supposed
to
have
had
a
safe
deliverance
when
south
carolina
perceived
that
congress
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
its
remonstrances
it
threatened
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
nullification
to
the
federal
tariff
bill
congress
persisted
in
its
former
system
and
at
length
the
storm
broke
out
in
the
course
of
the
citizens
of
south
carolina
named
a
national
state
convention
to
consult
upon
the
extraordinary
measures
which
they
were
called
upon
to
take
and
on
the
november
of
the
same
year
this
convention
promulgated
a
law
under
the
form
of
a
decree
which
annulled
the
federal
law
of
the
tariff
forbade
the
levy
of
the
imposts
which
that
law
commands
and
refused
to
recognize
the
appeal
which
might
be
made
to
the
federal
courts
of
law
this
decree
was
only
to
be
put
into
execution
in
the
ensuing
month
of
february
and
it
was
intimated
that
if
congress
modified
the
tariff
before
that
period
south
carolina
might
be
induced
to
proceed
no
farther
with
her
menaces
and
a
vague
desire
was
afterward
expressed
of
submitting
the
question
to
an
extraordinary
assembly
of
all
the
confederate
states
in
the
meantime
south
carolina
armed
her
militia
and
prepared
for
war
but
congress
which
had
slighted
its
suppliant
subjects
listened
to
their
complaints
as
soon
as
they
were
found
to
have
taken
up
arms
a
law
was
passed
by
which
the
tariff
duties
were
to
be
progressively
reduced
for
ten
years
until
they
were
brought
so
low
as
not
to
exceed
the
amount
of
supplies
necessary
to
the
government
thus
congress
completely
abandoned
the
principle
of
the
tariff
and
substituted
a
mere
fiscal
impost
for
a
system
of
protective
duties
the
government
of
the
union
in
order
to
conceal
its
defeat
had
recourse
to
an
expedient
which
is
very
much
in
vogue
with
feeble
governments
it
yielded
the
point
but
it
remained
inflexible
upon
the
principles
in
question
and
while
congress
was
altering
the
tariff
law
it
passed
another
bill
by
which
the
president
was
invested
with
extraordinary
powers
enabling
him
to
overcome
by
force
a
resistance
which
was
then
no
longer
to
be
apprehended
but
south
carolina
did
not
consent
to
leave
the
union
in
the
enjoyment
of
these
scanty
trophies
of
success
the
same
national
state
convention
which
annulled
the
tariff
bill
met
again
and
accepted
the
proffered
concession
but
at
the
same
time
it
declared
its
unabated
perseverance
in
the
doctrine
of
nullification
and
to
prove
what
it
said
it
annulled
the
law
investing
the
president
with
extraordinary
powers
although
it
was
very
certain
that
the
clauses
of
that
law
would
never
be
carried
into
effect
almost
all
the
controversies
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
have
taken
place
under
the
presidency
of
general
jackson
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
in
the
question
of
the
tariff
he
has
supported
the
claims
of
the
union
with
vigor
and
with
skill
i
am
however
of
opinion
that
the
conduct
of
the
individual
who
now
represents
the
federal
government
may
be
reckoned
as
one
of
the
dangers
which
threaten
its
continuance
some
persons
in
europe
have
formed
an
opinion
of
the
possible
influence
of
general
jackson
upon
the
affairs
of
his
country
which
appears
highly
extravagant
to
those
who
have
seen
more
of
the
subject
we
have
been
told
that
general
jackson
has
won
sundry
battles
that
he
is
an
energetic
man
prone
by
nature
and
by
habit
to
the
use
of
force
covetous
of
power
and
a
despot
by
taste
all
this
may
perhaps
be
true
but
the
inferences
which
have
been
drawn
from
these
truths
are
exceedingly
erroneous
it
has
been
imagined
that
general
jackson
is
bent
on
establishing
a
dictatorship
in
america
on
introducing
a
military
spirit
and
on
giving
a
degree
of
influence
to
the
central
authority
which
can
not
but
be
dangerous
to
provincial
liberties
but
in
america
the
time
for
similar
undertakings
and
the
age
for
men
of
this
kind
is
not
yet
come
if
general
jackson
had
entertained
a
hope
of
exercising
his
authority
in
this
manner
he
would
infallibly
have
forfeited
his
political
station
and
compromised
his
life
accordingly
he
has
not
been
so
imprudent
as
to
make
any
such
attempt
far
from
wishing
to
extend
the
federal
power
the
president
belongs
to
the
party
which
is
desirous
of
limiting
that
power
to
the
bare
and
precise
letter
of
the
constitution
and
which
never
puts
a
construction
upon
that
act
favorable
to
the
government
of
the
union
far
from
standing
forth
as
the
champion
of
centralization
general
jackson
is
the
agent
of
all
the
jealousies
of
the
states
and
he
was
placed
in
the
lofty
station
he
occupies
by
the
passions
of
the
people
which
are
most
opposed
to
the
central
government
it
is
by
perpetually
flattering
these
passions
that
he
maintains
his
station
and
his
popularity
general
jackson
is
the
slave
of
the
majority
he
yields
to
its
wishes
its
propensities
and
its
demands
say
rather
that
he
anticipates
and
forestalls
them
whenever
the
governments
of
the
states
come
into
collision
with
that
of
the
union
the
president
is
generally
the
first
to
question
his
own
rights
he
almost
always
outstrips
the
legislature
and
when
the
extent
of
the
federal
power
is
controverted
he
takes
part
as
it
were
against
himself
he
conceals
his
official
interests
and
extinguishes
his
own
natural
inclinations
not
indeed
that
he
is
naturally
weak
or
hostile
to
the
union
for
when
the
majority
decided
against
the
claims
of
the
partisans
of
nullification
he
put
himself
at
its
head
asserted
the
doctrines
which
the
nation
held
distinctly
and
energetically
and
was
the
first
to
recommend
forcible
measures
but
general
jackson
appears
to
me
if
i
may
use
the
american
expressions
to
be
a
federalist
by
taste
and
a
republican
by
calculation
general
jackson
stoops
to
gain
the
favor
of
the
majority
but
when
he
feels
that
his
popularity
is
secure
he
overthrows
all
obstacles
in
the
pursuit
of
the
objects
which
the
community
approves
or
of
those
which
it
does
not
look
upon
with
a
jealous
eye
he
is
supported
by
a
power
with
which
his
predecessors
were
unacquainted
and
he
tramples
on
his
personal
enemies
wherever
they
cross
his
path
with
a
facility
which
no
former
president
ever
enjoyed
he
takes
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
measures
which
no
one
before
him
would
have
ventured
to
attempt
he
even
treats
the
national
representatives
with
disdain
approaching
to
insult
he
puts
his
veto
upon
the
laws
of
congress
and
frequently
neglects
to
reply
to
that
powerful
body
he
is
a
favorite
who
sometimes
treats
his
master
roughly
the
power
of
general
jackson
perpetually
increases
but
that
of
the
president
declines
in
his
hands
the
federal
government
is
strong
but
it
will
pass
enfeebled
into
the
hands
of
his
successor
i
am
strangely
mistaken
if
the
federal
government
of
the
united
states
be
not
constantly
losing
strength
retiring
gradually
from
public
affairs
and
narrowing
its
circle
of
action
more
and
more
it
is
naturally
feeble
but
it
now
abandons
even
its
pretensions
to
strength
on
the
other
hand
i
thought
that
i
remarked
a
more
lively
sense
of
independence
and
a
more
decided
attachment
to
provincial
government
in
the
states
the
union
is
to
subsist
but
to
subsist
as
a
shadow
it
is
to
be
strong
in
certain
cases
and
weak
in
all
others
in
time
of
warfare
it
is
to
be
able
to
concentrate
all
the
forces
of
the
nation
and
all
the
resources
of
the
country
in
its
hands
and
in
time
of
peace
its
existence
is
to
be
scarcely
perceptible
as
if
this
alternate
debility
and
vigor
were
natural
or
possible
i
do
not
foresee
anything
for
the
present
which
may
be
able
to
check
this
general
impulse
of
public
opinion
the
causes
in
which
it
originated
do
not
cease
to
operate
with
the
same
effect
the
change
will
therefore
go
on
and
it
may
be
predicted
that
unless
some
extraordinary
event
occurs
the
government
of
the
union
will
grow
weaker
and
weaker
every
day
i
think
however
that
the
period
is
still
remote
at
which
the
federal
power
will
be
entirely
extinguished
by
its
inability
to
protect
itself
and
to
maintain
peace
in
the
country
the
union
is
sanctioned
by
the
manners
and
desires
of
the
people
its
results
are
palpable
its
benefits
visible
when
it
is
perceived
that
the
weakness
of
the
federal
government
compromises
the
existence
of
the
union
i
do
not
doubt
that
a
reaction
will
take
place
with
a
view
to
increase
its
strength
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
of
all
the
federal
governments
which
have
hitherto
been
established
the
one
which
is
most
naturally
destined
to
act
as
long
as
it
is
only
indirectly
assailed
by
the
interpretation
of
its
laws
and
as
long
as
its
substance
is
not
seriously
altered
a
change
of
opinion
an
internal
crisis
or
a
war
may
restore
all
the
vigor
which
it
requires
the
point
which
i
have
been
most
anxious
to
put
in
a
clear
light
is
simply
this
many
people
especially
in
france
imagine
that
a
change
of
opinion
is
going
on
in
the
united
states
which
is
favorable
to
a
centralization
of
power
in
the
hands
of
the
president
and
the
congress
i
hold
that
a
contrary
tendency
may
be
distinctly
observed
so
far
is
the
federal
government
from
acquiring
strength
and
from
threatening
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
as
it
grows
older
that
i
maintain
it
to
be
growing
weaker
and
weaker
and
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
union
alone
is
in
danger
such
are
the
facts
which
the
present
time
discloses
the
future
conceals
the
final
result
of
this
tendency
and
the
events
which
may
check
retard
or
accelerate
the
changes
i
have
described
but
i
do
not
affect
to
be
able
to
remove
the
veil
which
hides
them
from
our
sight
of
the
republican
institutions
of
the
united
states
and
what
their
chances
of
duration
are
the
union
is
the
republican
institutions
have
more
prospect
of
a
republic
for
the
present
the
natural
state
of
the
reason
of
in
order
to
destroy
it
all
laws
must
be
changed
at
the
same
time
and
a
great
alteration
take
place
in
difficulties
experienced
by
the
americans
in
creating
an
aristocracy
the
dismemberment
of
the
union
by
the
introduction
of
war
into
the
heart
of
those
states
which
are
now
confederate
with
standing
armies
a
dictatorship
and
a
heavy
taxation
might
eventually
compromise
the
fate
of
the
republican
institutions
but
we
ought
not
to
confound
the
future
prospects
of
the
republic
with
those
of
the
union
the
union
is
an
accident
which
will
last
only
so
long
as
circumstances
are
favorable
to
its
existence
but
a
republican
form
of
government
seems
to
me
to
be
the
natural
state
of
the
americans
which
nothing
but
the
continued
action
of
hostile
causes
always
acting
in
the
same
direction
could
change
into
a
monarchy
the
union
exists
principally
in
the
law
which
formed
it
one
revolution
one
change
in
public
opinion
might
destroy
it
for
ever
but
the
republic
has
a
much
deeper
foundation
to
rest
upon
what
is
understood
by
republican
government
in
the
united
states
is
the
slow
and
quiet
action
of
society
upon
itself
it
is
a
regular
state
of
things
really
founded
upon
the
enlightened
will
of
the
people
it
is
a
conciliatory
government
under
which
resolutions
are
allowed
time
to
ripen
and
in
which
they
are
deliberately
discussed
and
executed
with
mature
judgment
the
republicans
in
the
united
states
set
a
high
value
upon
morality
respect
religious
belief
and
acknowledge
the
existence
of
rights
they
profess
to
think
that
a
people
ought
to
be
moral
religious
and
temperate
in
proportion
as
it
is
free
what
is
called
the
republic
in
the
united
states
is
the
tranquil
rule
of
the
majority
which
after
having
had
time
to
examine
itself
and
to
give
proof
of
its
existence
is
the
common
source
of
all
the
powers
of
the
state
but
the
power
of
the
majority
is
not
of
itself
unlimited
in
the
moral
world
humanity
justice
and
reason
enjoy
an
undisputed
supremacy
in
the
political
world
vested
rights
are
treated
with
no
less
deference
the
majority
recognizes
these
two
barriers
and
if
it
now
and
then
overstep
them
it
is
because
like
individuals
it
has
passions
and
like
them
it
is
prone
to
do
what
is
wrong
while
it
discerns
what
is
right
but
the
demagogues
of
europe
have
made
strange
discoveries
a
republic
is
not
according
to
them
the
rule
of
the
majority
as
has
hitherto
been
taught
but
the
rule
of
those
who
are
strenuous
partisans
of
the
majority
it
is
not
the
people
who
preponderates
in
this
kind
of
government
but
those
who
best
know
what
is
for
the
good
of
the
people
a
happy
distinction
which
allows
men
to
act
in
the
name
of
nations
without
consulting
them
and
to
claim
their
gratitude
while
their
rights
are
spurned
a
republican
government
moreover
is
the
only
one
which
claims
the
right
of
doing
whatever
it
chooses
and
despising
what
men
have
hitherto
respected
from
the
highest
moral
obligations
to
the
vulgar
rules
of
common
sense
it
had
been
supposed
until
our
time
that
despotism
was
odious
under
whatever
form
it
appeared
but
it
is
a
discovery
of
modern
days
that
there
are
such
things
as
legitimate
tyranny
and
holy
injustice
provided
they
are
exercised
in
the
name
of
the
people
the
ideas
which
the
americans
have
adopted
respecting
the
republican
form
of
government
render
it
easy
for
them
to
live
under
it
and
ensure
its
duration
if
in
their
country
this
form
be
often
practically
bad
at
least
it
is
theoretically
good
and
in
the
end
the
people
always
acts
in
conformity
with
it
it
was
impossible
at
the
foundation
of
the
states
and
it
would
still
be
difficult
to
establish
a
central
administration
in
america
the
inhabitants
are
dispersed
over
too
great
a
space
and
separated
by
too
many
natural
obstacles
for
one
man
to
undertake
to
direct
the
details
of
their
existence
america
is
therefore
the
country
of
provincial
and
municipal
government
to
this
cause
which
was
plainly
felt
by
all
the
europeans
of
the
new
world
the
added
several
others
peculiar
to
themselves
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
of
the
north
american
colonies
municipal
liberty
had
already
penetrated
into
the
laws
as
well
as
the
manners
of
the
english
and
the
emigrants
adopted
it
not
only
as
a
necessary
thing
but
as
a
benefit
which
they
knew
how
to
appreciate
we
have
already
seen
the
manner
in
which
the
colonies
were
founded
every
province
and
almost
every
district
was
peopled
separately
by
men
who
were
strangers
to
each
other
or
who
associated
with
very
different
purposes
the
english
settlers
in
the
united
states
therefore
early
perceived
that
they
were
divided
into
a
great
number
of
small
and
distinct
communities
which
belonged
to
no
common
centre
and
that
it
was
needful
for
each
of
these
little
communities
to
take
care
of
its
own
affairs
since
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
central
authority
which
was
naturally
bound
and
easily
enabled
to
provide
for
them
thus
the
nature
of
the
country
the
manner
in
which
the
british
colonies
were
founded
the
habits
of
the
first
emigrants
in
short
everything
united
to
promote
in
an
degree
municipal
and
provincial
liberties
in
the
united
states
therefore
the
mass
of
the
institutions
of
the
country
is
essentially
republican
and
in
order
permanently
to
destroy
the
laws
which
form
the
basis
of
the
republic
it
would
be
necessary
to
abolish
all
the
laws
at
once
at
the
present
day
it
would
be
even
more
difficult
for
a
party
to
succeed
in
founding
a
monarchy
in
the
united
states
than
for
a
set
of
men
to
proclaim
that
france
should
henceforward
be
a
republic
royalty
would
not
find
a
system
of
legislation
prepared
for
it
beforehand
and
a
monarchy
would
then
exist
really
surrounded
by
republican
institutions
the
monarchical
principle
would
likewise
have
great
difficulty
in
penetrating
into
the
manners
of
the
americans
in
the
united
states
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
is
not
an
isolated
doctrine
bearing
no
relation
to
the
prevailing
manners
and
ideas
of
the
people
it
may
on
the
contrary
be
regarded
as
the
last
link
of
a
chain
of
opinions
which
binds
the
whole
world
that
providence
has
given
to
every
human
being
the
degree
of
reason
necessary
to
direct
himself
in
the
affairs
which
interest
him
exclusively
such
is
the
grand
maxim
upon
which
civil
and
political
society
rests
in
the
united
states
the
father
of
a
family
applies
it
to
his
children
the
master
to
his
servants
the
township
to
its
officers
the
province
to
its
townships
the
state
to
the
provinces
the
union
to
the
states
and
when
extended
to
the
nation
it
becomes
the
doctrine
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
thus
in
the
united
states
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
republic
is
the
same
which
governs
the
greater
part
of
human
actions
republican
notions
insinuate
themselves
into
all
the
ideas
opinions
and
habits
of
the
americans
while
they
are
formally
recognized
by
the
legislation
and
before
this
legislation
can
be
altered
the
whole
community
must
undergo
very
serious
changes
in
the
united
states
even
the
religion
of
most
of
the
citizens
is
republican
since
it
submits
the
truths
of
the
other
world
to
private
judgment
as
in
politics
the
care
of
its
temporal
interests
is
abandoned
to
the
good
sense
of
the
people
thus
every
man
is
allowed
freely
to
take
that
road
which
he
thinks
will
lead
him
to
heaven
just
as
the
law
permits
every
citizen
to
have
the
right
of
choosing
his
government
it
is
evident
that
nothing
but
a
long
series
of
events
all
having
the
same
tendency
can
substitute
for
this
combination
of
laws
opinions
and
manners
a
mass
of
opposite
opinions
manners
and
laws
if
republican
principles
are
to
perish
in
america
they
can
only
yield
after
a
laborious
social
process
often
interrupted
and
as
often
resumed
they
will
have
many
apparent
revivals
and
will
not
become
totally
extinct
until
an
entirely
new
people
shall
have
succeeded
to
that
which
now
exists
now
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
is
no
symptom
or
presage
of
the
approach
of
such
a
revolution
there
is
nothing
more
striking
to
a
person
newly
arrived
in
the
united
states
than
the
kind
of
tumultuous
agitation
in
which
he
finds
political
society
the
laws
are
incessantly
changing
and
at
first
sight
it
seems
impossible
that
a
people
so
variable
in
its
desires
should
avoid
adopting
within
a
short
space
of
time
a
completely
new
form
of
government
such
apprehensions
are
however
premature
the
instability
which
affects
political
institutions
is
of
two
kinds
which
ought
not
to
be
confounded
the
first
which
modifies
secondary
laws
is
not
incompatible
with
a
very
settled
state
of
society
the
other
shakes
the
very
foundations
of
the
constitution
and
attacks
the
fundamental
principles
of
legislation
this
species
of
instability
is
always
followed
by
troubles
and
revolutions
and
the
nation
which
suffers
under
it
is
in
a
state
of
violent
transition
experience
shows
that
these
two
kinds
of
legislative
instability
have
no
necessary
connexion
for
they
have
been
found
united
or
separate
according
to
times
and
circumstances
the
first
is
common
in
the
united
states
but
not
the
second
the
americans
often
change
their
laws
but
the
foundation
of
the
constitution
is
respected
in
our
days
the
republican
principle
rules
in
america
as
the
monarchical
principle
did
in
france
under
louis
xiv
the
french
of
that
period
were
not
only
friends
of
the
monarchy
but
they
thought
it
impossible
to
put
anything
in
its
place
they
received
it
as
we
receive
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
return
of
the
seasons
among
them
the
royal
power
had
neither
advocates
nor
opponents
in
like
manner
does
the
republican
government
exist
in
america
without
contention
or
opposition
without
proofs
and
arguments
by
a
tacit
agreement
a
sort
of
it
is
however
my
opinion
that
by
changing
their
administrative
forms
as
often
as
they
do
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
compromise
the
future
stability
of
their
government
it
may
be
apprehended
that
men
perpetually
thwarted
in
their
designs
by
the
mutability
of
legislation
will
learn
to
look
upon
republican
institutions
as
an
inconvenient
form
of
society
the
evil
resulting
from
the
instability
of
the
secondary
enactments
might
then
raise
a
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
constitution
and
indirectly
bring
about
a
revolution
but
this
epoch
is
still
very
remote
it
has
been
objected
by
an
american
review
that
our
author
is
mistaken
in
charging
our
laws
with
instability
and
in
answer
to
the
charge
the
permanence
of
our
fundamental
political
institutions
has
been
contrasted
with
the
revolutions
in
france
but
the
objection
proceeds
upon
a
mistake
of
the
author
meaning
which
at
this
page
is
very
clearly
expressed
he
refers
to
the
instability
which
modifies
and
not
to
that
which
shakes
the
foundations
of
the
constitution
the
distinction
is
equally
sound
and
philosophic
and
those
in
the
least
acquainted
with
the
history
of
our
legislation
must
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
author
remarks
the
frequent
revisions
of
the
statutes
of
the
states
rendered
necessary
by
the
multitude
variety
and
often
the
contradiction
of
the
enactments
furnish
abundant
evidence
of
this
it
may
however
be
foreseen
even
now
that
when
the
americans
lose
their
republican
institutions
they
will
speedily
arrive
at
a
despotic
government
without
a
long
interval
of
limited
monarchy
montesquieu
remarked
that
nothing
is
more
absolute
than
the
authority
of
a
prince
who
immediately
succeeds
a
republic
since
the
powers
which
had
fearlessly
been
intrusted
to
an
elected
magistrate
are
then
transferred
to
an
hereditary
sovereign
this
is
true
in
general
but
it
is
more
peculiarly
applicable
to
a
democratic
republic
in
the
united
states
the
magistrates
are
not
elected
by
a
particular
class
of
citizens
but
by
the
majority
of
the
nation
they
are
the
immediate
representatives
of
the
passions
of
the
multitude
and
as
they
are
wholly
dependent
upon
its
pleasure
they
excite
neither
hatred
nor
fear
hence
as
i
have
already
shown
very
little
care
has
been
taken
to
limit
their
influence
and
they
are
left
in
possession
of
a
vast
deal
of
arbitrary
power
this
state
of
things
has
engendered
habits
which
would
outlive
itself
the
american
magistrate
would
retain
his
power
but
he
would
cease
to
be
responsible
for
the
exercise
of
it
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
bounds
could
then
be
set
to
tyranny
some
of
our
european
politicians
expect
to
see
an
aristocracy
arise
in
america
and
they
already
predict
the
exact
period
at
which
it
will
be
able
to
assume
the
reins
of
government
i
have
previously
observed
and
i
repeat
my
assertion
that
the
present
tendency
of
american
society
appears
to
me
to
become
more
and
more
democratic
nevertheless
i
do
not
assert
that
the
americans
will
not
at
some
future
time
restrict
the
circle
of
political
rights
in
their
country
or
confiscate
those
rights
to
the
advantage
of
a
single
individual
but
i
can
not
imagine
that
they
will
ever
bestow
the
exclusive
exercise
of
them
upon
a
privileged
class
of
citizens
or
in
other
words
that
they
will
ever
found
an
aristocracy
an
aristocratic
body
is
composed
of
a
certain
number
of
citizens
who
without
being
very
far
removed
from
the
mass
of
the
people
are
nevertheless
permanently
stationed
above
it
a
body
which
it
is
easy
to
touch
and
difficult
to
strike
with
which
the
people
are
in
daily
contact
but
with
which
they
can
never
combine
nothing
can
be
imagined
more
contrary
to
nature
and
to
the
secret
propensities
of
the
human
heart
than
a
subjection
of
this
kind
and
men
who
are
left
to
follow
their
own
bent
will
always
prefer
the
arbitrary
power
of
a
king
to
the
regular
administration
of
an
aristocracy
aristocratic
institutions
can
not
subsist
without
laying
down
the
inequality
of
men
as
a
fundamental
principle
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
legislation
affecting
the
condition
of
the
human
family
as
much
as
it
affects
that
of
society
but
these
things
are
so
repugnant
to
natural
equity
that
they
can
only
be
extorted
from
men
by
constraint
i
do
not
think
a
single
people
can
be
quoted
since
human
society
began
to
exist
which
has
by
its
own
free
will
and
by
its
own
exertions
created
an
aristocracy
within
its
own
bosom
all
the
aristocracies
of
the
middle
ages
were
founded
by
military
conquest
the
conqueror
was
the
noble
the
vanquished
became
the
serf
inequality
was
then
imposed
by
force
and
after
it
had
been
introduced
into
the
manners
of
the
country
it
maintained
its
own
authority
and
was
sanctioned
by
the
legislation
communities
have
existed
which
were
aristocratic
from
their
earliest
origin
owing
to
circumstances
anterior
to
that
event
and
which
became
more
democratic
in
each
succeeding
age
such
was
the
destiny
of
the
romans
and
of
the
barbarians
after
them
but
a
people
having
taken
its
rise
in
civilisation
and
democracy
which
should
gradually
establish
an
inequality
of
conditions
until
it
arrived
at
inviolable
privileges
and
exclusive
castes
would
be
a
novelty
in
the
world
and
nothing
intimates
that
america
is
likely
to
furnish
so
singular
an
example
reflections
on
the
causes
of
the
commercial
prosperity
of
the
united
states
the
americans
destined
by
nature
to
be
a
great
maritime
extent
of
their
depth
of
their
size
of
their
the
commercial
superiority
of
the
less
attributable
however
to
physical
circumstances
than
to
moral
and
intellectual
reason
of
this
future
destiny
of
the
as
a
commercial
the
dissolution
of
the
union
would
not
check
the
maritime
vigor
of
the
reason
of
will
naturally
supply
the
wants
of
the
inhabitants
of
south
they
will
become
like
the
english
the
factors
of
a
great
portion
of
the
world
the
coast
of
the
united
states
from
the
bay
of
fundy
to
the
sabine
river
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
more
than
two
thousand
miles
in
extent
these
shores
form
an
unbroken
line
and
they
are
all
subject
to
the
same
government
no
nation
in
the
world
possesses
vaster
deeper
or
more
secure
ports
for
shipping
than
the
americans
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
constitute
a
great
civilized
people
which
fortune
has
placed
in
the
midst
of
an
uncultivated
country
at
a
distance
of
three
thousand
miles
from
the
central
point
of
civilisation
america
consequently
stands
in
daily
need
of
european
trade
the
americans
will
no
doubt
ultimately
succeed
in
producing
or
manufacturing
at
home
most
of
the
articles
which
they
require
but
the
two
continents
can
never
be
independent
of
each
other
so
numerous
are
the
natural
ties
which
exist
between
their
wants
their
ideas
their
habits
and
their
manners
the
union
produces
peculiar
commodities
which
are
now
become
necessary
to
us
but
which
can
not
be
cultivated
or
can
only
be
raised
at
an
enormous
expense
upon
the
soil
of
europe
the
americans
only
consume
a
small
portion
of
this
produce
and
they
are
willing
to
sell
us
the
rest
europe
is
therefore
the
market
of
america
as
america
is
the
market
of
europe
and
maritime
commerce
is
no
less
necessary
to
enable
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
to
transport
their
raw
materials
to
the
ports
of
europe
than
it
is
to
enable
us
to
supply
them
with
our
manufactured
produce
the
united
states
were
therefore
necessarily
reduced
to
the
alternative
of
increasing
the
business
of
other
maritime
nations
to
a
great
extent
if
they
had
themselves
declined
to
enter
into
commerce
as
the
spaniards
of
mexico
have
hitherto
done
or
in
the
second
place
of
becoming
one
of
the
first
trading
powers
of
the
globe
the
have
always
displayed
a
very
decided
taste
for
the
sea
the
declaration
of
independence
broke
the
commercial
restrictions
which
united
them
to
england
and
gave
a
fresh
and
powerful
stimulus
to
their
maritime
genius
ever
since
that
time
the
shipping
of
the
union
has
increased
in
almost
the
same
rapid
proportion
as
the
number
of
its
inhabitants
the
americans
themselves
now
transport
to
their
own
shores
of
the
european
produce
which
they
consume
and
they
also
bring
of
the
exports
of
the
new
world
to
the
european
consumer
the
ships
of
the
united
states
fill
the
docks
of
havre
and
of
liverpool
while
the
number
of
english
and
french
vessels
which
are
to
be
seen
at
new
york
is
comparatively
small
thus
not
only
does
the
american
merchant
face
competition
in
his
own
country
but
he
even
supports
that
of
foreign
nations
in
their
own
ports
with
success
this
is
readily
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
can
cross
the
seas
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
any
other
vessels
in
the
world
as
long
as
the
mercantile
shipping
of
the
united
states
preserves
this
superiority
it
will
not
only
retain
what
it
has
acquired
but
it
will
constantly
increase
in
prosperity
it
is
difficult
to
say
for
what
reason
the
americans
can
trade
at
a
lower
rate
than
other
nations
and
one
is
at
first
led
to
attribute
this
circumstance
to
the
physical
or
natural
advantages
which
are
within
their
reach
but
this
supposition
is
erroneous
the
american
vessels
cost
almost
as
much
to
build
as
our
own
they
are
not
better
built
and
they
generally
last
for
a
shorter
time
the
pay
of
the
american
sailor
is
more
considerable
than
the
pay
on
board
european
ships
which
is
proved
by
the
great
number
of
europeans
who
are
to
be
met
with
in
the
merchant
vessels
of
the
united
states
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
true
cause
of
their
superiority
must
not
be
sought
for
in
physical
advantages
but
that
it
is
wholly
attributable
to
their
moral
and
intellectual
qualities
the
following
comparison
will
illustrate
my
meaning
during
the
campaigns
of
the
revolution
the
french
introduced
a
new
system
of
tactics
into
the
art
of
war
which
perplexed
the
oldest
generals
and
very
nearly
destroyed
the
most
ancient
monarchies
in
europe
they
undertook
what
had
never
been
before
attempted
to
make
shift
without
a
number
of
things
which
had
always
been
held
to
be
indispensable
in
warfare
they
required
novel
exertions
on
the
part
of
their
troops
which
no
civilized
nations
had
ever
thought
of
they
achieved
great
actions
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
and
they
risked
human
life
without
hesitation
to
obtain
the
object
in
view
the
french
had
less
money
and
fewer
men
than
their
enemies
their
resources
were
infinitely
inferior
nevertheless
they
were
constantly
victorious
until
their
adversaries
chose
to
imitate
their
example
the
americans
have
introduced
a
similar
system
into
their
commercial
speculations
and
they
do
for
cheapness
what
the
french
did
for
conquest
the
european
sailor
navigates
with
prudence
he
only
sets
sail
when
the
weather
is
favorable
if
an
unforeseen
accident
befalls
him
he
puts
into
port
at
night
he
furls
a
portion
of
his
canvass
and
when
the
whitening
billows
intimate
the
vicinity
of
land
he
checks
his
way
and
takes
an
observation
of
the
sun
but
the
american
neglects
these
precautions
and
braves
these
dangers
he
weighs
anchor
in
the
midst
of
tempestuous
gales
by
night
and
by
day
he
spreads
his
sheets
to
the
wind
he
repairs
as
he
goes
along
such
damage
as
his
vessel
may
have
sustained
from
the
storm
and
when
he
at
last
approaches
the
term
of
his
voyage
he
darts
onward
to
the
shore
as
if
he
already
descried
a
port
the
americans
are
often
shipwrecked
but
no
trader
crosses
the
seas
so
rapidly
and
as
they
perform
the
same
distance
in
a
shorter
time
they
can
perform
it
at
a
cheaper
rate
the
european
touches
several
times
at
different
ports
in
the
course
of
a
long
voyage
he
loses
a
good
deal
of
precious
time
in
making
the
harbor
or
in
waiting
for
a
favorable
wind
to
leave
it
and
he
pays
daily
dues
to
be
allowed
to
remain
there
the
american
starts
from
boston
to
go
to
purchase
tea
in
china
he
arrives
at
canton
stays
there
a
few
days
and
then
returns
in
less
than
two
years
he
has
sailed
as
far
as
the
entire
circumference
of
the
globe
and
he
has
seen
land
but
once
it
is
true
that
during
a
voyage
of
eight
or
ten
months
he
has
drunk
brackish
water
and
lived
upon
salt
meat
that
he
has
been
in
a
continual
contest
with
the
sea
with
disease
and
with
the
tedium
of
monotony
but
upon
his
return
he
can
sell
a
pound
of
his
tea
for
a
halfpenny
less
than
the
english
merchant
and
his
purpose
is
accomplished
i
can
not
better
explain
my
meaning
than
by
saying
that
the
americans
affect
a
sort
of
heroism
in
their
manner
of
trading
but
the
european
merchant
will
always
find
it
very
difficult
to
imitate
his
american
competitor
who
in
adopting
the
system
which
i
have
just
described
follows
not
only
a
calculation
of
his
gain
but
an
impulse
of
his
nature
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
are
subject
to
all
the
wants
and
all
the
desires
which
result
from
an
advanced
stage
of
civilisation
but
as
they
are
not
surrounded
by
a
community
admirably
adapted
like
that
of
europe
to
satisfy
their
wants
they
are
often
obliged
to
procure
for
themselves
the
various
articles
which
education
and
habit
have
rendered
necessaries
in
america
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
same
individual
tills
his
field
builds
his
dwelling
contrives
his
tools
makes
his
shoes
and
weaves
the
coarse
stuff
of
which
his
dress
is
composed
this
circumstance
is
prejudicial
to
the
excellence
of
the
work
but
it
powerfully
contributes
to
awaken
the
intelligence
of
the
workman
nothing
tends
to
materialise
man
and
to
deprive
his
work
of
the
faintest
trace
of
mind
more
than
extreme
division
of
labor
in
a
country
like
america
where
men
devoted
to
special
occupations
are
rare
a
long
apprenticeship
can
not
be
required
from
any
one
who
embraces
a
profession
the
americans
therefore
change
their
means
of
gaining
a
livelihood
very
readily
and
they
suit
their
occupations
to
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
in
the
manner
most
profitable
to
themselves
men
are
to
be
met
with
who
have
successively
been
barristers
farmers
merchants
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
physicians
if
the
american
be
less
perfect
in
each
craft
than
the
european
at
least
there
is
scarcely
any
trade
with
which
he
is
utterly
unacquainted
his
capacity
is
more
general
and
the
circle
of
his
intelligence
is
enlarged
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
are
never
fettered
by
the
axioms
of
their
profession
they
escape
from
all
the
prejudices
of
their
present
station
they
are
not
more
attached
to
one
line
of
operation
than
to
another
they
are
not
more
prone
to
employ
an
old
method
than
a
new
one
they
have
no
rooted
habits
and
they
easily
shake
off
the
influence
which
the
habits
of
other
nations
might
exercise
upon
their
minds
from
a
conviction
that
their
country
is
unlike
any
other
and
that
its
situation
is
without
a
precedent
in
the
world
america
is
a
land
of
wonders
in
which
everything
is
in
constant
motion
and
every
movement
seems
an
improvement
the
idea
of
novelty
is
there
indissolubly
connected
with
the
idea
of
melioration
no
natural
boundary
seems
to
be
set
to
the
efforts
of
man
and
what
is
not
yet
done
is
only
what
he
has
not
yet
attempted
to
do
this
perpetual
change
which
goes
on
in
the
united
states
these
frequent
vicissitudes
of
fortune
accompanied
by
such
unforeseen
fluctuations
in
private
and
in
public
wealth
serve
to
keep
the
minds
of
the
citizens
in
a
perpetual
state
of
feverish
agitation
which
admirably
invigorates
their
exertions
and
keeps
them
in
a
state
of
excitement
above
the
ordinary
level
of
mankind
the
whole
life
of
an
american
is
passed
like
a
game
of
chance
a
revolutionary
crisis
or
a
battle
as
the
same
causes
are
continually
in
operation
throughout
the
country
they
ultimately
impart
an
irresistible
impulse
to
the
national
character
the
american
taken
as
a
chance
specimen
of
his
countrymen
must
then
be
a
man
of
singular
warmth
in
his
desires
enterprising
fond
of
adventure
and
above
all
of
innovation
the
same
bent
is
manifest
in
all
that
he
does
he
introduces
it
into
his
political
laws
his
religious
doctrines
his
theories
of
social
economy
and
his
domestic
occupations
he
bears
it
with
him
in
the
depth
of
the
backwoods
as
well
as
in
the
business
of
the
city
it
is
the
same
passion
applied
to
maritime
commerce
which
makes
him
the
cheapest
and
the
quickest
trader
in
the
world
as
long
as
the
sailors
of
the
united
states
retain
these
inspiriting
advantages
and
the
practical
superiority
which
they
derive
from
them
they
will
not
only
continue
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
producers
and
consumers
of
their
own
country
but
they
will
tend
more
and
more
to
become
like
the
english
the
factors
of
all
other
peoples
this
prediction
has
already
begun
to
be
realized
we
perceive
that
the
american
traders
are
introducing
themselves
as
intermediate
agents
in
the
commerce
of
several
european
nations
and
america
will
offer
a
still
wider
field
to
their
enterprise
the
great
colonies
which
were
founded
in
south
america
by
the
spaniards
and
the
portuguese
have
since
become
empires
civil
war
and
oppression
now
lay
waste
those
extensive
regions
population
does
not
increase
and
the
inhabitants
are
too
much
absorbed
in
the
cares
of
even
to
attempt
any
melioration
of
their
condition
such
however
will
not
always
be
the
case
europe
has
succeeded
by
her
own
efforts
in
piercing
the
gloom
of
the
middle
ages
south
america
has
the
same
christian
laws
and
christian
manners
as
we
have
she
contains
all
the
germs
of
civilisation
which
have
grown
amid
the
nations
of
europe
or
their
offsets
added
to
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
our
example
why
then
should
she
always
remain
uncivilized
it
is
clear
that
the
question
is
simply
one
of
time
at
some
future
period
which
may
be
more
or
less
remote
the
inhabitants
of
south
america
will
constitute
flourishing
and
enlightened
nations
but
when
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
of
south
america
begin
to
feel
the
wants
common
to
all
civilized
nations
they
will
still
be
unable
to
satisfy
those
wants
for
themselves
as
the
youngest
children
of
civilisation
they
must
perforce
admit
the
superiority
of
their
elder
brethren
they
will
be
agriculturists
long
before
they
succeed
in
manufactures
or
commerce
and
they
will
require
the
mediation
of
strangers
to
exchange
their
produce
beyond
seas
for
those
articles
for
which
a
demand
will
begin
to
be
felt
it
is
unquestionable
that
the
americans
of
the
north
will
one
day
supply
the
wants
of
the
americans
of
the
south
nature
has
placed
them
in
contiguity
and
has
furnished
the
former
with
every
means
of
knowing
and
appreciating
those
demands
of
establishing
a
permanent
connexion
with
those
states
and
of
gradually
filling
their
markets
the
merchant
of
the
united
states
could
only
forfeit
these
natural
advantages
if
he
were
very
inferior
to
the
merchant
of
europe
to
whom
he
is
on
the
contrary
superior
in
several
respects
the
americans
of
the
united
states
already
exercise
a
very
considerable
moral
influence
upon
all
the
people
of
the
new
world
they
are
the
source
of
intelligence
and
all
the
nations
which
inhabit
the
same
continent
are
already
accustomed
to
consider
them
as
the
most
enlightened
the
most
powerful
and
the
most
wealthy
members
of
the
great
american
family
all
eyes
are
therefore
turned
toward
the
union
and
the
states
of
which
that
body
is
composed
are
the
models
which
the
other
communities
try
to
imitate
to
the
best
of
their
power
it
is
from
the
united
states
that
they
borrow
their
political
principles
and
their
laws
the
americans
of
the
united
states
stand
in
precisely
the
same
position
with
regard
to
the
peoples
of
south
america
as
their
fathers
the
english
occupy
with
regard
to
the
italians
the
spaniards
the
portuguese
and
all
those
nations
of
europe
which
receive
their
articles
of
daily
consumption
from
england
because
they
are
less
advanced
in
civilisation
and
trade
england
is
at
this
time
the
natural
emporium
of
almost
all
the
nations
which
are
within
its
reach
the
american
union
will
perform
the
same
part
in
the
other
hemisphere
and
every
community
which
is
founded
or
which
prospers
in
the
new
world
is
founded
and
prospers
to
the
advantage
of
the
if
the
union
were
to
be
dissolved
the
commerce
of
the
states
which
now
compose
it
would
undoubtedly
be
checked
for
a
time
but
this
consequence
would
be
less
perceptible
than
is
generally
supposed
it
is
evident
that
whatever
may
happen
the
commercial
states
will
remain
united
they
are
all
contiguous
to
each
other
they
have
identically
the
same
opinions
interests
and
manners
and
they
are
alone
competent
to
form
a
very
great
maritime
power
even
if
the
south
of
the
union
were
to
become
independent
of
the
north
it
would
still
require
the
service
of
those
states
i
have
already
observed
that
the
south
is
not
a
commercial
country
and
nothing
intimates
that
it
is
likely
to
become
so
the
americans
of
the
south
of
the
united
states
will
therefore
be
obliged
for
a
long
time
to
come
to
have
recourse
to
strangers
to
export
their
produce
and
to
supply
them
with
the
commodities
which
are
requisite
to
satisfy
their
wants
but
the
northern
states
are
undoubtedly
able
to
act
as
their
intermediate
agents
cheaper
than
any
other
merchants
they
will
therefore
retain
that
employment
for
cheapness
is
the
sovereign
law
of
commerce
national
claims
and
national
prejudices
can
not
resist
the
influence
of
cheapness
nothing
can
be
more
virulent
than
the
hatred
which
exists
between
the
americans
of
the
united
states
and
the
english
but
notwithstanding
these
inimical
feelings
the
americans
derive
the
greater
part
of
their
manufactured
commodities
from
england
because
england
supplies
them
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
any
other
nation
thus
the
increasing
prosperity
of
america
turns
notwithstanding
the
grudges
of
the
americans
to
the
advantage
of
british
manufactures
reason
shows
and
experience
proves
that
no
commercial
prosperity
can
be
durable
if
it
can
not
be
united
in
case
of
need
to
naval
force
this
truth
is
as
well
understood
in
the
united
states
as
it
can
be
anywhere
else
the
americans
are
already
able
to
make
their
flag
respected
in
a
few
years
they
will
be
able
to
make
it
feared
i
am
convinced
that
the
dismemberment
of
the
union
would
not
have
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
naval
power
of
the
americans
but
that
it
would
powerfully
contribute
to
increase
it
at
the
present
time
the
commercial
states
are
connected
with
others
which
have
not
the
same
interests
and
which
frequently
yield
an
unwilling
consent
to
the
increase
of
a
maritime
power
by
which
they
are
only
indirectly
benefited
if
on
the
contrary
the
commercial
states
of
the
union
formed
one
independent
nation
commerce
would
become
the
foremost
of
their
national
interests
they
would
consequently
be
willing
to
make
very
great
sacrifices
to
protect
their
shipping
and
nothing
would
prevent
them
from
pursuing
their
designs
upon
this
point
nations
as
well
as
men
almost
always
betray
the
most
prominent
features
of
their
future
destiny
in
their
earliest
years
when
i
contemplate
the
ardor
with
which
the
prosecute
commercial
enterprise
the
advantages
which
befriend
them
and
the
success
of
their
undertakings
i
can
not
refrain
from
believing
that
they
will
one
day
become
the
first
maritime
power
of
the
globe
they
are
born
to
rule
the
seas
as
the
romans
were
to
conquer
the
world

the
native
of
north
america
retains
his
opinions
and
the
most
insignificant
of
his
habits
with
a
degree
of
tenacity
which
has
no
parallel
in
history
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
the
wandering
tribes
of
north
america
have
had
daily
intercourse
with
the
whites
and
they
have
never
derived
from
them
either
a
custom
or
an
idea
yet
the
european
have
exercised
a
powerful
influence
over
the
savages
they
have
made
them
more
licentious
but
not
more
european
in
the
summer
of
i
happened
to
be
beyond
lake
michigan
at
a
place
called
green
bay
which
serves
as
the
extreme
frontier
between
the
united
states
and
the
indians
on
the
northwestern
side
here
i
became
acquainted
with
an
american
officer
major
who
after
talking
to
me
at
length
on
the
inflexibility
of
the
indian
character
related
the
following
fact
i
formerly
knew
a
young
indian
said
he
who
had
been
educated
at
a
college
in
new
england
where
he
had
greatly
distinguished
himself
and
had
acquired
the
external
appearance
of
a
member
of
civilized
society
when
the
war
broke
out
between
ourselves
and
the
english
in
i
saw
this
young
man
again
he
was
serving
in
our
army
at
the
head
of
the
warriors
of
his
tribe
for
the
indians
were
admitted
among
the
ranks
of
the
americans
upon
condition
that
they
would
abstain
from
their
horrible
custom
of
scalping
their
victims
on
the
evening
of
the
battle
of
came
and
sat
himself
down
by
the
fire
of
our
bivouac
i
asked
him
what
had
been
his
fortune
that
day
he
related
his
exploits
and
growing
warm
and
animated
by
the
recollection
of
them
he
concluded
by
suddenly
opening
the
breast
of
his
coat
saying
must
not
betray
me
see
here
and
i
actually
beheld
said
the
major
between
his
body
and
his
shirt
the
skin
and
hair
of
an
english
head
still
dripping
with
gore
in
the
thirteen
original
states
there
are
only
indians
remaining
see
legislative
documents
congress
no
p
clarke
and
cass
in
their
report
to
congress
the
february
expressed
themselves
thus
the
time
when
the
indians
generally
could
supply
themselves
with
food
and
clothing
without
any
of
the
articles
of
civilized
life
has
long
since
passed
away
the
more
remote
tribes
beyond
the
mississippi
who
live
where
immense
herds
of
buffalo
are
yet
to
be
found
and
who
follow
those
animals
in
their
periodical
migrations
could
more
easily
than
any
others
recur
to
the
habits
of
their
ancestors
and
live
without
the
white
man
or
any
of
his
manufactures
but
the
buffalo
is
constantly
receding
the
smaller
animals
the
bear
the
deer
the
beaver
the
otter
the
muskrat
principally
minister
to
the
comfort
and
support
of
the
indians
and
these
can
not
be
taken
without
guns
ammunition
and
traps
among
the
northwestern
indians
particularly
the
labor
of
supplying
a
family
with
food
is
excessive
day
after
day
is
spent
by
the
hunter
without
success
and
during
this
interval
his
family
must
subsist
upon
bark
or
roots
or
perish
want
and
misery
are
around
them
and
among
them
many
die
every
winter
from
actual
starvation
the
indians
will
not
live
as
europeans
live
and
yet
they
can
neither
subsist
without
them
nor
exactly
after
the
fashion
of
their
fathers
this
is
demonstrated
by
a
fact
which
i
likewise
give
upon
official
authority
some
indians
of
a
tribe
on
the
banks
of
lake
superior
had
killed
a
european
the
american
government
interdicted
all
traffic
with
the
tribe
to
which
the
guilty
parties
belonged
until
they
were
delivered
up
to
justice
this
measure
had
the
desired
effect
five
years
ago
says
volney
in
his
tableaux
des
etats
unis
in
going
from
vincennes
to
kaskaskia
a
territory
which
now
forms
part
of
the
state
of
illinois
but
which
at
the
time
i
mention
was
completely
wild
you
could
not
cross
a
prairie
without
seeing
herds
of
from
four
to
five
hundred
buffaloes
there
are
now
none
remaining
they
swam
across
the
mississippi
to
escape
from
the
hunters
and
more
particularly
from
the
bells
of
the
american
cows
the
truth
of
what
i
here
advance
may
be
easily
proved
by
consulting
the
tabular
statement
of
indian
tribes
inhabiting
the
united
states
and
their
territories
legislative
documents
congress
no
pp
it
is
there
shown
that
the
tribes
of
america
are
rapidly
decreasing
although
the
europeans
are
at
a
considerable
distance
from
them
the
indians
says
clarke
and
cass
in
their
report
to
congress
are
attached
to
their
country
by
the
same
feelings
which
bind
us
to
ours
and
besides
there
are
certain
superstitious
notions
connected
with
the
alienation
of
what
the
great
spirit
gave
to
their
ancestors
which
operate
strongly
upon
the
tribes
who
have
made
few
or
no
cessions
but
which
are
gradually
weakened
as
our
intercourse
with
them
is
extended
will
not
sell
the
spot
which
contains
the
bones
of
our
fathers
is
almost
always
the
first
answer
to
a
proposition
for
a
sale
see
in
the
legislative
documents
of
congress
doc
the
narrative
of
what
takes
place
on
these
occasions
this
curious
passage
is
from
the
abovementioned
report
made
to
congress
by
clarke
and
cass
in
february
cass
is
now
secretary
of
war
the
indians
says
the
report
reach
the
poor
and
almost
naked
large
quantities
of
goods
are
taken
there
by
the
traders
and
are
seen
and
examined
by
the
indians
the
women
and
children
become
importunate
to
have
their
wants
supplied
and
their
influence
is
soon
exerted
to
induce
a
sale
their
improvidence
is
habitual
and
unconquerable
the
gratification
of
his
immediate
wants
and
desires
is
the
ruling
passion
of
an
indian
the
expectation
of
future
advantages
seldom
produces
much
effect
the
experience
of
the
past
is
lost
and
the
prospects
of
the
future
disregarded
it
would
be
utterly
hopeless
to
demand
a
cession
of
land
unless
the
means
were
at
hand
of
gratifying
their
immediate
wants
and
when
their
condition
and
circumstances
are
fairly
considered
it
ought
not
to
surprise
us
that
they
are
so
anxious
to
relieve
themselves
on
the
of
may
edward
everett
affirmed
before
the
house
of
representatives
that
the
americans
had
already
acquired
by
to
the
east
and
west
of
the
mississippi
of
acres
in
the
osages
gave
up
acres
for
an
annual
payment
of
dollars
in
the
quapaws
yielded
up
acres
for
dollars
they
reserved
for
themselves
a
territory
of
acres
for
a
a
solemn
oath
was
taken
that
it
should
be
respected
but
before
long
it
was
invaded
like
the
rest
bell
in
his
report
of
the
committee
on
indian
affairs
february
has
these
words
to
pay
an
indian
tribe
what
their
ancient
are
worth
to
them
after
the
game
is
fled
or
destroyed
as
a
mode
of
appropriating
wild
lands
claimed
by
indians
has
been
found
more
convenient
and
certainly
it
is
more
agreeable
to
the
forms
of
justice
as
well
as
more
merciful
than
to
assert
the
possession
of
them
by
the
sword
thus
the
practice
of
buying
indian
titles
is
but
the
substitute
which
humanity
and
expediency
have
imposed
in
place
of
the
sword
in
arriving
at
the
actual
enjoyment
of
property
claimed
by
the
right
of
discovery
and
sanctioned
by
the
natural
superiority
allowed
to
the
claims
of
civilized
communities
over
those
of
savage
tribes
up
to
the
present
time
so
invariable
has
been
the
operation
of
certain
causes
first
in
diminishing
the
value
of
forest
lands
to
the
indians
and
secondly
in
disposing
them
to
sell
readily
that
the
plan
of
buying
their
right
of
occupancy
has
never
threatened
to
retard
in
any
perceptible
degree
the
prosperity
of
any
of
the
states

p
this
seems
indeed
to
be
the
opinion
of
almost
all
the
american
statesmen
judging
of
the
future
by
the
past
says
cass
we
can
not
err
in
anticipating
a
progressive
diminution
of
their
numbers
and
their
eventual
extinction
unless
our
border
should
become
stationary
and
they
be
removed
beyond
it
or
unless
some
radical
change
should
take
place
in
the
principles
of
our
intercourse
with
them
which
it
is
easier
to
hope
for
than
to
expect
among
other
warlike
enterprises
there
was
one
of
the
wampanoags
and
other
confederate
tribes
under
metacom
in
against
the
colonists
of

the
english
were
also

and
the
work
entitled
lettres
edifiantes
in
all
the
tribes
says
volney
in
his
tableau
des
etats
unis
there
still
exists
a
generation
of
old
warriors
who
can
not
forbear
when
they
see
their
countrymen
using
the
hoe
from
exclaiming
against
the
degradation
of
ancient
manners
and
asserting
that
the
savages
owe
their
decline
to
these
innovations
adding
that
they
have
only
to
return
to
their
primitive
habits
in
order
to
recover
their
power
and
their
glory
the
following
description
occurs
in
an
official
document
until
a
young
man
has
been
engaged
with
an
enemy
and
has
performed
some
acts
of
valor
he
gains
no
consideration
but
is
regarded
nearly
as
a
woman
in
their
great
all
the
warriors
in
succession
strike
the
post
as
it
is
called
and
recount
their
exploits
on
these
occasions
their
auditory
consists
of
the
kinsmen
friends
and
comrades
of
the
narrator
the
profound
impression
which
his
discourse
produces
on
them
is
manifested
by
the
silent
attention
it
receives
and
by
the
loud
shouts
which
hail
its
termination
the
young
man
who
finds
himself
at
such
a
meeting
without
anything
to
recount
is
very
unhappy
and
instances
have
sometimes
occurred
of
young
warriors
whose
passions
had
been
thus
inflamed
quitting
the
suddenly
and
going
off
alone
to
seek
for
trophies
which
they
might
exhibit
and
adventures
which
they
might
be
allowed
to
relate
these
nations
are
now
swallowed
up
in
the
states
of
georgia
tennessee
alabama
and
mississippi
there
were
formerly
in
the
south
four
great
nations
remnants
of
which
still
exist
the
choctaws
the
chickasaws
the
creeks
and
the
cherokees
the
remnants
of
these
four
nations
amounted
in
to
about
individuals
it
is
computed
that
there
are
now
remaining
in
the
territory

many
of

having
taken

they

the
mixed
race
has
been
less
numerous

less
influential
in
north
america
than
in
any
other
country
the
american
continent
was
peopled
by
two
great
nations
of
europe
the
french
and
the
english
the
former
were
not
slow
in
connecting
themselves
with
the
daughters
of
the
natives
but
there
was
an
unfortunate
affinity
between
the
indian
character
and
their
own
instead
of
giving
the
tastes
and
habits
of
civilized
life
to
the
savages
the
french
too
often
grew
passionately
fond
of
the
state
of
wild
freedom
they
found
them
in
they
became
the
most
dangerous
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
desert
and
won
the
friendship
of
the
indian
by
exaggerating

wrote
thus
to
louis
in
it
has
long
been
believed
that
in
order
to
civilize
the
savages
we
ought
to
draw
them
nearer
to
us
but
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
we
have
been
mistaken
those
which
have
been
brought
into
contact
with
us
have
not
become
french
and
the
french
who
have
lived
among
them
are
changed
into
savages

and
dress

the
englishman
on
the
contrary
continuing
obstinately
attached
to
the
customs
and
the
most
insignificant
habits
of
his
forefathers
has
remained
in
the
midst
of
the
american
solitudes
just
what
he
was
in
the
bosom
of
european
cities
he
would
not
allow
of
any
communication
with
savages
whom
he
despised
and
avoided
with
care
the
union
of
his
race
with
theirs
thus
while
the
french
exercised
no
salutary
influence
over
the
indians
the
english
have
always
remained
alien
from
them
there
is
in
the
adventurous
life
of
the
hunter
a
certain
irresistible
charm
which
seizes
the
heart
of
man
and
carries
him
away
in
spite
of
reason
and
experience
this
is
plainly
shown
by
the
memoirs
of
tanner
tanner
is
a
european
who
was
carried
away
at
the
age
of
six
by
the
indians
and
has
remained
thirty
years
with
them
in
the
woods
nothing
can
be
conceived
more
appalling
than
the
miseries
which
he
describes
he
tells
us
of
tribes
without
a
chief
families
without
a
nation
to
call
their
own
men
in
a
state
of
isolation
wrecks
of
powerful
tribes
wandering
at
random
amid
the
ice
and

and
desolate
solitudes
of

hunger
and

pursue

every

their
life
is
in
jeopardy
among
these
men
manners
have
lost
their
empire
traditions
are
without
power
they
become
more
and
more
savage
tanner
shared
in
all
these
miseries
he
was
aware
of
his
european
origin
he
was
not
kept
away
from
the
whites
by
force
on
the
contrary
he
came
every
year
to
trade
with
them
entered
their
dwellings
and
saw
their
enjoyments
he
knew
that
whenever
he
chose
to
return
to
civilized
life
he
was
perfectly
able
to
do
so
and
he
remained
thirty
years
in
the
deserts
when
he
came
to
civilized
society
he
declared
that
the
rude
existence
which
he
described
had
a
secret
charm
for
him
which
he
was
unable
to
define
he
returned
to
it
again
and
again
at
length
he
abandoned
it
with
poignant
regret
and
when
he
was
at
length
fixed
among
the
whites
several
of
his
children
refused
to
share
his
tranquil
and
easy
situation
i
saw
tanner
myself
at
the
lower
end
of
lake
superior
he
seemed
to
be
more
like
a
savage
than
a
civilized
being
his
book
is
written
without
either
taste
or
order
but
he
gives
even
unconsciously
a
lively
picture
of
the
prejudices
the
passions
vices
and
above
all
of
the
destitution
in
which
he
lived
the
destructive
influence
of
highly
civilized
nations
upon
others
which
are
less
so
has
been
exemplified
by
the
europeans
themselves
about
a
century
ago
the
french
founded
the
town
of
vincennes
upon
the
wabash
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
and
they
lived
there
in
great
plenty
until
the
arrival
of
the
american
settlers
who
first
ruined
the
previous
inhabitants
by
their
competition
and
afterward
purchased
their
lands
at
a
very
low
rate
at
the
time
when
de
volney
from
whom
i
borrow
these
details
passed
through
vincennes
the
number
of
the
french
was
reduced
to
a
hundred
individuals
most
of
whom
were
about
to
pass
over
to
louisiana
or
to
canada
these
french
settlers
were
worthy
people
but
idle
and
uninstructed
they
had
contracted
many
of
the
habits
of
the
savages
the
americans
who
were
perhaps
their
inferiors
in
a
moral
point
of
view
were
immeasurably
superior
to
them
in
intelligence
they
were
industrious
rich
and
accustomed
to
govern
their
own
community
i
myself
saw
in
canada
where
the
intellectual
difference
between
the
two
races
is
less
striking
that
the
english
are
the
masters
of
commerce
and
manufacture
in
the
canadian
country
that
they
spread
on
all
sides
and
confine
the
french
within
limits
which
scarcely
suffice
to
contain
them
in
like
manner
in
louisiana
almost
all
activity
in
commerce
and
manufacture
centres
in
the
hands
of
the
but
the
case
of
texas
is
still
more
striking
the
state
of
texas
is
a
part
of
mexico
and
lies
upon
the
frontier
between
that
country
and
the
united
states
in
the
course
of
the
last
few
years
the
have
penetrated
into
this
province
which
is
still
thinly
peopled
they
purchase
land
they
produce
the
commodities
of
the
country
and
supplant
the
original
population
it
may
easily
be
foreseen
that
if
mexico
takes
no
steps
to
check
this
change
the
province
of
texas
will
very
shortly
cease
to
belong
to
that
government
if
the
different
degrees
comparatively
so
light
which
exist
in
european
civilisation
produce
results
of
such
magnitude
the
consequences
which
must
ensue
from
the
collision
of
the
most
perfect
european
civilisation
with
indian
savages
may
readily
be
conceived
see
in
the
legislative
documents
congress
no
instances
of
excesses
of
every
kind
committed
by
the
whites
upon
the
territory
of
the
indians
either
in
taking
possession
of
a
part
of
their
lands
until
compelled
to
retire
by
the
troops
of
congress
or
carrying
off
their
cattle
burning
their
houses
cutting
down
their
corn
and
doing
violence
to
their
persons
it
appears
nevertheless
from
all
these
documents
that
the
claims
of
the
natives
are
constantly
protected
by
the
government
from
the
abuse
of
force
the
union
has
a
representative
agent
continually
employed
to
reside
among
the
indians
and
the
report
of
the
cherokee
agent
which
is
among
the
documents
i
have
referred
to
is
almost
always
favorable
to
the
indians
the
intrusion
of
whites
he
says
upon
the
lands
of
the
cherokees
would
cause
ruin
to
the
poor
helpless
and
inoffensive
inhabitants
and
he
farther
remarks
upon
the
attempt
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
establish
a
division
line
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
the
boundaries
of
the
cherokees
that
the
line
drawn
having
been
made
by
the
whites
and
entirely
upon
evidence
of
their
several
rights
was
of
no
validity
whatever
in
the
state
of
alabama
divided
the
creek
territory
into
counties
and
subjected
the
indian
population
to
the
power
of
european
magistrates
in
the
state
of
mississippi
assimilated
the
choctaws
and
chickasaws
to
the
white
population
and
declared
that
any
of
them
that
should
take
the
title
of
chief
would
be
punished
by
a
fine
of
dollars
and
year
imprisonment
when
these
laws
were
enforced
upon
the
choctaws
who
inhabited
that
district
the
tribes
assembled
their
chief
communicated
to
them
the
intentions
of
the
whites
and
read
to
them
some
of
the
laws
to
which
it
was
intended
that
they
should
submit
and
they
unanimously
declared
that
it
was
better
at
once
to
retreat
again
into
the
wilds
the
georgians
who
are
so
much
annoyed
by
the
proximity
of
the
indians
inhabit
a
territory
which
does
not
at
present
contain
more
than
seven

withdraw

protection
from
that
individual
and
give
him
up
to
be
punished
as
the
cherokee
nation
should
think
fit
this
does
not
prevent
them
from
promising
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
do
so

to

that
they
can
not
expect
to
retain
possession
of

time
occupied
by
them
but
gives
them
the
most
positive
assurance
of
uninterrupted
peace
if
they
would
remove
beyond
the
mississippi
as
if
the
power
which
could
not
grant
them
protection
then
would
be
able
to
afford
it
them
hereafter
to
obtain
a
correct
idea
of
the
policy
pursued
by
the
several
states
and
the
union
with
respect
to
the
indians
it
is
necessary
to
consult
the
laws
of
the
colonial
and
state
governments
relating
to
the
indian
inhabitants
see
the
legislative
documents
congress
no
the
laws
of

the
same
subject
and
especially
that

march
see

of

secretary
of

relative

the
honor
of
this
result
is
however
by
no
means
due
to
the
spaniards
if
the
indian
tribes
had
not
been
tillers
of
the
ground
at
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
europeans
they
would
unquestionably
have
been
destroyed
in
south
as
well
as
in
north
america
see
among
other
documents
the
report
made
by
bell
in
the
name
of
the
committee
on
indian
affairs
in
which
it
is
most
logically
established
and
most
learnedly
proved
that
the
fundamental
principle
that
the
indians
had
no
right
by
virtue
of
their
ancient
possession
either
of
will
or
sovereignty
has
never
been
abandoned
either
expressly
or
by
implication
in
perusing
this
report
which
is
evidently
drawn
up
by
an
able
hand
one
is
astonished
at
the
facility
with
which
the
author
gets
rid
of
all
arguments
founded
upon
reason
and
natural
right
which
he
designates
as
abstract
and
theoretical
principles
the
more
i
contemplate
the
difference
between
civilized
and
uncivilized
man
with
regard
to
the
principles
of
justice
the
more
i
observe
that
the
former
contests
the
justice
of
those
rights
which
the
latter
simply
violates
it
is
well
known
that
several
of
the
most
distinguished
authors
of
antiquity
and
among
them
æsop
and
terence
were
or
had
been
slaves
slaves
were
not
always
taken
from
barbarous
nations
and
the
chances
of
war
reduced
highly
civilized
men
to
servitude
to
induce
the
whites
to
abandon
the
opinion
they
have
conceived
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
inferiority
of
their
former
slaves
the
negroes
must
change
but
as
long
as
this
opinion
subsists
to
change
is
impossible
see
beverley
history
of
virginia
see
also
in
memoirs
some
curious
details
concerning
the
introduction
of
negroes
into
virginia
and
the
first
act
which
prohibited
the
importation
of
them
in
the
number
of
slaves
was
less
considerable
in
the
north
but
the
advantages
resulting
from
slavery
were
not
more
contested
there
than
in
the
south
in
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
declared
that
the
direct
importation
of
slaves
ought
to
be
encouraged
as
much
as
possible
and
smuggling
severely
punished
in
order
not
to
discourage

curious
researches
by
belknap
upon
slavery
in
new
england
are
to
be
found
in
the
historical
collections
of
massachusetts
vol
it
appears
that
negroes
were
introduced
there
in
but
that
the
legislation
and
manners
of
the
people
were
opposed
to
slavery
from
the
first
see
also
in
the
same
work
the
manner
in
which
public
opinion
and
afterward
the
laws
finally
put
an
end
to
slavery
not
only
is
slavery
prohibited
in
ohio
but
no
free
negroes
are
allowed
to
enter
the
territory
of
that
state
or
to
hold
property
in
it
see
the
statutes
of
ohio
the
activity
of
ohio
is
not
confined
to
individuals
but
the
undertakings
of
the
state
are
surprisingly
great
a
canal
has
been
established
between
lake
erie
and
the
ohio
by
means
of
which
the
valley
of
the
mississippi

exact
numbers
given
by
the
census

were

in
the
census
gave
kentucky
ohio
independently
of
these
causes
which
wherever
free
workmen
abound
render
their
labor
more
productive
and
more
economical
than
that
of
slaves
another
cause
may
be
pointed
out
which
is
peculiar
to
the
united
states
the
has
hitherto
been
cultivated
with
success
only
upon
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
near
the
mouth
of
that
river
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
louisiana
the
cultivation
of
the
is
exceedingly
lucrative
nowhere
does
a
laborer
earn
so
much
by
his
work
and
as
there
is
always
a
certain
relation
between
the
cost
of
production
and
the
value
of
the
produce
the
price
of
slaves
is
very
high
in
louisiana
but
louisiana
is
one
of
the
confederate
states
and
slaves
may
be
carried
thither
from
all
parts
of
the
union
the
price
given
for
slaves
in
new
orleans
consequently
raises
the
value
of
slaves
in
all
the
other
markets
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
in
the
countries
where
the
land
is
less
productive
the
cost
of
slave
labor
is
still
very
considerable
which
gives
an
additional
advantage
to
the
competition
of
free
labor
a
peculiar
reason
contributes
to
detach
the
two
states
from
the
cause
of
slavery
the
former
wealth
of
this
part
of
the
union
was
principally
derived
from
the
cultivation
of
tobacco
this
cultivation
is
specially
carried
on
by
slaves
but
within
the
last
few
years
the
of
tobacco
has
diminished
while
the
value
of
the
slaves
remains
the
same
thus
the
ratio
between
the
cost
of
production
and
the
value
of
the
produce
is
changed
the
natives
of
maryland
and
virginia
are
therefore
more
disposed
than
they
were
thirty
years
ago
to
give
up
slave
labor
in
the
cultivation
of
tobacco
or
to
give
up
slavery
and
tobacco
at
the
same
time
the
states
in
which
slavery
is
abolished
usually
do
what
they
can
to
render
their
territory
disagreeable
to
the
negroes
as
a
place
of
residence
and
as
a
kind
of
emulation
exists
between
the
different
states
in
this
respect
the
unhappy
blacks
can
only
choose
the
least
of
the
evils
which
beset
them
there
is
a
very
great
difference
between
the
mortality
of
the
blacks
and
of
the
whites
in
the
states
in
which
slavery
is
abolished
from
to
only
one
out
of
individuals
of
the
white
population
died
in
philadelphia
but
one
negro
out
of
individuals
of
the
black
population
died
in
the
same
space
of
time
the
mortality
is
by
no
means
so
great
among
the
negroes
who
are
still
slaves
see
emmerson
medical
statistics
p
this
is
true
of
the
spots
in
which
rice
is
cultivated
which
are
unwholesome
in
all
countries
are
particularly
dangerous
in
those
regions
which
are
exposed
to
the
beams
of
a
tropical
sun
europeans
would
not
find
it
easy
to
cultivate
the
soil
in
that
part
of
the
new
world
if
it
must
necessarily
be
made
to
produce
rice
but
may
they
not
subsist
without
these
states
are
nearer
to
the
equator
than
italy
and
spain
but
the
temperature
of
the
continent
of
america
is

much

the
spanish

formerly

of

from

be
transported
into

louisiana
called
attakapas

still
cultivate
the
soil
without

assistance
of

but
their
industry
is
so
languid
as
scarcely
to
supply
their
most
necessary
wants
we
find
it
asserted
in
an
american
work
entitled
letters
on
the
colonization
society
by
carey
that
for
the
last
forty
years
the
black
race
has
increased
more
rapidly
than
the
white
race
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
that
if
we
take
the
average
population
of
the
five
states
of
the
south
into
which
slaves
were
first
introduced

we
shall
find
that

augmented

in

this

infinitely

anything
that

can

thus
for

it

stated
in

as
collected
by
conseil
nothing
is
more
clearly
written
in
the
book
of
destiny
than
the
emancipation
of
the
blacks
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
two
races
will
never
live
in
a
state
of
equal
freedom
under
the
same
government
so
insurmountable
are
the
barriers
which
nature
habit
and
opinions
have
established
between
them
if
the
british
west
india
planters
had
governed
themselves
they
would
assuredly
not
have
passed

slave
emancipation
bill

the

probable
results
by
carey
philadelphia
april
this
last
regulation
was
laid
down
by
the
founders
of
the
settlement
they
apprehended
that
a
state
of
things
might
arise
in
africa
similar
to
that
which
exists
on
the
frontiers
of
the
united
states
and
that
if
the
negroes
like
the
indians
were
brought
into
collision
with
a
people
more
enlightened
than
themselves
they
would
be
destroyed
before
they
could
be
civilized
nor
would
these
be
the
only
difficulties
attendant
upon
the
undertaking
if
the
union
undertook
to
buy
up
the
negroes
now
in
america
in
order
to
transport
them
to
africa
the
price
of
slaves
increasing
with
their
scarcity
would
soon
become
enormous

original

said

lafayette
four
of
the
eastern
states
were
only
attached
to
the
union
like
so
many
inanimate

to
living
men
the
profound
peace
of
the
union
affords
no
pretext
for
a
standing
army
and
without
a
standing
army
a
government
is
not
prepared
to
profit
by
a
favorable
opportunity
to
conquer
resistance
and
take
the
sovereign
power
by
surprise
thus
the
province
of
holland
in
the
republic
of
the
low
countries
and
the
emperor
in
the
germanic
confederation
have
sometimes
put
themselves
in

place

have
employed

federal
authority
to
their

slavery
is
prejudicial
to
the

prosperity
of

south
in
several
different
ways
by
diminishing
the
spirit
of

among

whites

by
preventing

are
generally
taken
from
the
lowest
ranks
of

population
but
in
the
southern
states
these
lowest
ranks
are
composed
of
slaves
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
employ
them
at
sea
they
are
unable
to
serve
as
well
as
a
white
crew
and
apprehensions
would
always
be
entertained
of
their
mutinying
in

of
their
escaping

view
of

it
may
be
seen
that
in
the
course
of
the
last
ten
years
the
population
of
one
district
as
for
instance
the
state
of
delaware
has
increased
in
the
proportion
of
per
cent
while
that
of
another
as
the
territory
of

has
increased
per

thus
the
population
of
virginia
has
augmented
per
and
that
of

per
in
the

space
of

the
general
table
of
these
changes
which
is
given
in
the
national
calendar
displays
a
striking
picture
of
the
unequal
fortunes
of
the
different
states
it
has
just
been
said
that
in
the
course
of
the
last
term
the
population
of
virginia
has
increased
per
cent
and
it
is
necessary
to
explain
how
the
number
of
representatives
of
a
state
may
decrease
when
the
population
of
that
state
far
from
diminishing
is
actually
upon
the
increase
i
take
the
state
of
virginia
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
as
my
term
of
comparison
the
number
of
representatives
of
virginia
in
was
proportionate
to
the
total
number
of
the
representatives
of
the
union
and
to
the
relation
which
its
population
bore
to
that
of
the
whole
union
in
the
number
of
representatives
of
virginia
was
likewise
proportionate
to
the
total
number
of
the
representatives
of
the
union
and
to
the
relation
which
its
population
augmented
in
the
course
of
ten
years
bore
to
the
augmented
population
of
the
union
in
the
same
space
of
time
the
new
number
of
virginian
representatives
will
then
be
to
the
old
number
on
the
one
hand
as
the
new
number
of
all
the
representatives
is
to
the
old
number
and
on
the
other
hand
as
the
augmentation
of
the
population
of
virginia
is
to
that
of
the
whole
population
of
the
country
thus
if
the
increase
of
the
population
of
the
lesser
country
be
to
that
of
the
greater
in
an
exact
inverse
ratio
of
the
proportion
between
the
new
and
the
old
numbers
of
all
the
representatives
the
number
of
representatives
of
virginia
will
remain
stationary
and
if
the
increase
of
the
virginian
population
be
to
that
of
the
whole
union
in
a
feebler
ratio
than
the
new
number
of
representatives
of
the
union
to
the
old
number
the
number
of
the
representatives
of
virginia
must
decrease

committees

country
assuredly
constitutes
the
first
element
of
its
wealth

ten

endeavored
to
divide
my
subject
into
distinct
portions
in
order
to
study
each
of
them
with
more
attention
my
present
object
is
to
embrace
the
whole
from
one
single
point
the
remarks
i
shall
make
will
be
less
detailed
but
they
will
be
more
sure
i
shall
perceive
each
object
less
distinctly
but
i
shall
descry
the
principal
facts
with
more
certainty
a
traveller
who
has
just
left
the
walls
of
an
immense
city
climbs
the
neighboring
hill
as
he
goes
farther
off
he
loses
sight
of
the
men
whom
he
has
so
recently
quitted
their
dwellings
are
confused
in
a
dense
mass
he
can
no
longer
distinguish
the
public
squares
and
he
can
scarcely
trace
out
the
great
thoroughfares
but
his
eye
has
less
difficulty
in
following
the
boundaries
of
the
city
and
for
the
first
time
he
sees
the
shape
of
the
vast
whole
such
is
the
future
destiny
of
the
british
race
in
north
america
to
my
eye
the
details
of
the
stupendous
picture
are
overhung
with
shade
but
i
conceive
a
clear
idea
of
the
entire
subject
the
territory
now
occupied
or
possessed
by
the
united
states
of
america
forms
about
part
of
the
habitable
earth
but
extensive
as
these
confines
are
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
race
will
always
remain
within
them
indeed
it
has
already
far
overstepped
them
there
was
once
a
time
at
which
we
also
might
have
created
a
great
french
nation
in
the
american
wilds
to
the
influence
of
the
english
upon
the
destinies
of
the
new
world
france
formerly
possessed
a
territory
in
north
america
scarcely
less
extensive
than
the
whole
of
europe
the
three
greatest
rivers
of
that
continent
then
flowed
within
her
dominions
the
indian
tribes
which
dwelt
between
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
and
the
delta
of
the
mississippi
were
unaccustomed
to
any
tongue
but
ours
and
all
the
european
settlements
scattered
over
that
immense
region
recalled
the
traditions
of
our
country
louisburg
montmorency
duquesne
vincennes
new
orleans
for
such
were
the
names
they
bore
are
words
dear
to
france
and
familiar
to
our
ears
but
a
concourse
of
circumstances
which
it
would
be
tedious
to
enumerate
have
deprived
us
of
this
magnificent
inheritance
wherever
the
french
settlers
were
numerically
weak
and
partially
established
they
have
disappeared
those
who
remain
are
collected
on
a
small
extent
of
country
and
are
now
subject
to
other
laws
the
french
inhabitants
of
lower
canada
constitute
at
the
present
time
the
remnant
of
an
old
nation
lost
in
the
midst
of
a
new
people
a
foreign
population
is
increasing
around
them
unceasingly
and
on
all
sides
which
already
penetrates
among
the
ancient
masters
of
the
country
predominates
in
their
cities
and
corrupts
their
language
this
population
is
identical
with
that
of
the
united
states
it
is
therefore
with
truth
that
i
asserted
that
the
british
race
is
not
confined
within
the
frontiers
of
the
union
since
it
already
extends
to
the
northeast
to
the
northwest
nothing
is
to
be
met
with
but
a
few
insignificant
russian
settlements
but
to
the
southwest
mexico
presents
a
barrier
to
the
thus
the
spaniards
and
the
are
properly
speaking
the
only
two
races
which
divide
the
possession
of
the
new
world
the
limits
of
separation
between
them
have
been
settled
by
a
treaty
but
although
the
conditions
of
that
treaty
are
exceedingly
favorable
to
the
i
do
not
doubt
that
they
will
shortly
infringe
this
arrangement
vast
provinces
extending
beyond
the
frontiers
of
the
union
toward
mexico
are
still
destitute
of
inhabitants
the
natives
of
the
united
states
will
forestall
the
rightful
occupants
of
these
solitary
regions
they
will
take
possession
of
the
soil
and
establish
social
institutions
so
that
when
the
legal
owner
arrives
at
length
he
will
find
the
wilderness
under
cultivation
and
strangers
quietly
settled
in
the
midst
of
his
inheritance
the
lands
of
the
new
world
belong
to
the
first
occupants
and
they
are
the
natural
reward
of
the
swiftest
pioneer
even
the
countries
which
are
already
peopled
will
have
some
difficulty
in
securing
themselves
from
this
invasion
i
have
already
alluded
to
what
is
taking
place
in
the
province
of
texas
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
are
perpetually
migrating
to
texas
where
they
purchase
land
and
although
they
conform
to
the
laws
of
the
country
they
are
gradually
founding
the
empire
of
their
own
language
and
their
own
manners
the
province
of
texas
is
still
part
of
the
mexican
dominions
but
it
will
soon
contain
no
mexicans
the
same
thing
has
occurred
whenever
the
have
come
into
contact
with
populations
of
a
different
origin
the
prophetic
accuracy
of
the
author
in
relation
to
the
present
actual
condition
of
texas
exhibits
the
sound
and
clear
perception
with
which
he
surveyed
our
institutions
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
british
race
has
acquired
an
amazing
preponderance
over
all
the
other
european
races
in
the
new
world
and
that
it
is
very
superior
to
them
in
civilisation
in
industry
and
in
power
as
long
as
it
is
only
surrounded
by
desert
or
countries
as
long
as
it
encounters
no
dense
populations
upon
its
route
through
which
it
can
not
work
its
way
it
will
assuredly
continue
to
spread
the
lines
marked
out
by
treaties
will
not
stop
it
but
it
will
everywhere
transgress
these
imaginary
barriers
the
geographical
position
of
the
british
race
in
the
new
world
is
peculiarly
favorable
to
its
rapid
increase
above
its
northern
frontiers
the
icy
regions
of
the
pole
extend
and
a
few
degrees
below
its
southern
confines
lies
the
burning
climate
of
the
equator
the
are
therefore
placed
in
the
most
temperate
and
habitable
zone
of
the
continent
it
is
generally
supposed
that
the
prodigious
increase
of
population
in
the
united
states
is
posterior
to
their
declaration
of
independence
but
this
is
an
error
the
population
increased
as
rapidly
under
the
colonial
system
as
it
does
at
the
present
day
that
is
to
say
it
doubled
in
about
years
but
this
proportion
which
is
now
applied
to
millions
was
then
applied
to
thousands
of
inhabitants
and
the
same
fact
which
was
scarcely
noticeable
a
century
ago
is
now
evident
to
every
observer
the
british
subjects
in
canada
who
are
dependent
on
a
king
augment
and
spread
almost
as
rapidly
as
the
british
settlers
of
the
united
states
who
live
under
a
republican
government
during
the
war
of
independence
which
lasted
eight
years
the
population
continued
to
increase
without
intermission
in
the
same
ratio
although
powerful
indian
nations
allied
with
the
english
existed
at
that
time
upon
the
western
frontiers
the
emigration
westward
was
never
checked
while
the
enemy
laid
waste
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
kentucky
the
western
parts
of
pennsylvania
and
the
states
of
vermont
and
of
maine
were
filling
with
inhabitants
nor
did
the
unsettled
state
of
the
constitution
which
succeeded
the
war
prevent
the
increase
of
the
population
or
stop
its
progress
across
the
wilds
thus
the
difference
of
laws
the
various
conditions
of
peace
and
war
of
order
and
of
anarchy
have
exercised
no
perceptible
influence
upon
the
gradual
development
of
the
this
may
be
readily
understood
for
the
fact
is
that
no
causes
are
sufficiently
general
to
exercise
a
simultaneous
influence
over
the
whole
of
so
extensive
a
territory
one
portion
of
the
country
always
offers
a
sure
retreat
from
the
calamities
which
afflict
another
part
and
however
great
may
be
the
evil
the
remedy
which
is
at
hand
is
greater
still
it
must
not
then
be
imagined
that
the
impulse
of
the
british
race
in
the
new
world
can
be
arrested
the
dismemberment
of
the
union
and
the
hostilities
which
might
ensue
the
abolition
of
republican
institutions
and
the
tyrannical
government
which
might
succeed
it
may
retard
this
impulse
but
they
can
not
prevent
it
from
ultimately
fulfilling
the
destinies
to
which
that
race
is
reserved
no
power
upon
earth
can
close
upon
the
emigrants
that
fertile
wilderness
which
offers
resources
to
all
industry
and
a
refuge
from
all
want
future
events
of
whatever
nature
they
may
be
will
not
deprive
the
americans
of
their
climate
or
of
their
inland
seas
of
their
great
rivers
or
of
their
exuberant
soil
nor
will
bad
laws
revolutions
and
anarchy
be
able
to
obliterate
that
love
of
prosperity
and
that
spirit
of
enterprise
which
seem
to
be
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
their
race
or
to
extinguish
that
knowledge
which
guides
them
on
their
way
thus
in
the
midst
of
the
uncertain
future
one
event
at
least
is
sure
at
a
period
which
may
be
said
to
be
near
for
we
are
speaking
of
the
life
of
a
nation
the
will
alone
cover
the
immense
space
contained
between
the
polar
regions
and
the
tropics
extending
from
the
coasts
of
the
atlantic
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
ocean
the
territory
which
will
probably
be
occupied
by
the
at
some
future
time
may
be
computed
to
equal
of
europe
in
extent
the
climate
of
the
union
is
upon
the
whole
preferable
to
that
of
europe
and
its
natural
advantages
are
not
less
great
it
is
therefore
evident
that
its
population
will
at
some
future
time
be
proportionate
to
our
own
europe
divided
as
it
is
between
so
many
different
nations
and
torn
as
it
has
been
by
incessant
wars
and
the
barbarous
manners
of
the
middle
ages
has
notwithstanding
attained
a
population
of
inhabitants
to
the
square
league
what
cause
can
prevent
the
united
states
from
having
as
numerous
a
population
in
time
many
ages
must
elapse
before
the
divers
offsets
of
the
british
race
in
america
cease
to
present
the
same
homogeneous
characteristics
and
the
time
can
not
be
foreseen
at
which
a
permanent
inequality
of
conditions
will
be
established
in
the
new
world
whatever
differences
may
arise
from
peace
or
from
war
from
freedom
or
oppression
from
prosperity
or
want
between
the
destinies
of
the
different
descendants
of
the
great
family
they
will
at
least
preserve
an
analogous
social
condition
and
they
will
hold
in
common
the
customs
and
the
opinions
to
which
that
social
condition
has
given
birth
in
the
middle
ages
the
tie
of
religion
was
sufficiently
powerful
to
imbue
all
the
different
populations
of
europe
with
the
same
civilisation
the
british
of
the
new
world
have
a
thousand
other
reciprocal
ties
and
they
live
at
a
time
when
the
tendency
to
equality
is
general
among
mankind
the
middle
ages
were
a
period
when
everything
was
broken
up
when
each
people
each
province
each
city
and
each
family
had
a
strong
tendency
to
maintain
its
distinct
individuality
at
the
present
time
an
opposite
tendency
seems
to
prevail
and
the
nations
seem
to
be
advancing
to
unity
our
means
of
intellectual
intercourse
unite
the
most
remote
parts
of
the
earth
and
it
is
impossible
for
men
to
remain
strangers
to
each
other
or
to
be
ignorant
of
the
events
which
are
taking
place
in
any
corner
of
the
globe
the
consequence
is
that
there
is
less
difference
at
the
present
day
between
the
europeans
and
their
descendants
in
the
new
world
than
there
was
between
certain
towns
in
the
thirteenth
century
which
were
only
separated
by
a
river
if
this
tendency
to
assimilation
brings
foreign
nations
closer
to
each
other
it
must
prevent
the
descendants
of
the
same
people
from
becoming
aliens
to
each
other
the
time
will
therefore
come
when
one
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
men
will
be
living
in
north
america
equal
in
condition
the
progeny
of
one
race
owing
their
origin
to
the
same
cause
and
preserving
the
same
civilisation
the
same
language
the
same
religion
the
same
habits
the
same
manners
and
imbued
with
the
same
opinions
propagated
under
the
same
forms
the
rest
is
uncertain
but
this
is
certain
and
it
is
a
fact
new
to
the
world
a
fact
fraught
with
such
portentous
consequences
as
to
baffle
the
efforts
even
of
the
imagination
there
are
at
the
present
time
two
great
nations
in
the
world
which
seem
to
tend
toward
the
same
end
although
they
started
from
different
points
i
allude
to
the
russians
and
the
americans
both
of
them
have
grown
up
unnoticed
and
while
the
attention
of
mankind
was
directed
elsewhere
they
have
suddenly
assumed
a
most
prominent
place
among
the
nations
and
the
world
learned
their
existence
and
their
greatness
at
almost
the
same
time
all
other
nations
seem
to
have
nearly
reached
their
natural
limits
and
only
to
be
charged
with
the
maintenance
of
their
power
but
these
are
still
in
the
act
of
growth
all
the
others
are
stopped
or
continue
to
advance
with
extreme
difficulty
these
are
proceeding
with
ease
and
with
celerity
along
a
path
to
which
the
human
eye
can
assign
no

natural

foremost
of

circumstances
is
that
nations
which
are
accustomed

institutions

are
better
able

prosperous
colonies

of

is
indispensable

measure

the
languages
which
are
spoken
by
the
indians
of
america
from
the
pole
to
cape
horn
are
said
to
be
all
formed
upon
the
same
model
and
subject
to
the
same
grammatical
rules
whence
it
may
fairly
be
concluded
that
all
the
indian
nations
sprang
from
the
same
stock
each
tribe
of
the
american
continent
speaks
a
different
dialect
but
the
number
of
languages
properly
so
called
is
very
small
a
fact
which
tends
to
prove
that
the
nations
of
the
new
world
had
not
a
very
remote
origin
moreover
the
languages
of
america
have
a
great
degree
of
regularity
from
which
it
seems
probable
that
the
tribes
which
employ
them
had
not
undergone
any
great
revolutions
or
been
incorporated
voluntarily
or
by
constraint
with
foreign
nations
for
it
is
generally
the
union
of
several
languages
into
one
which
produces
grammatical
irregularities
it
is
not
long
since
the
american
languages
especially
those
of
the
north
first
attracted
the
serious
attention
of
philologists
when
the
discovery
was
made
that
this
idiom
of
a
barbarous
people
was
the
product
of
a
complicated
system
of
ideas
and
very
learned
combinations
these
languages
were
found
to
be
very
rich
and
great
pains
had
been
taken
at
their
formation
to
render
them
agreeable
to
the
ear
the
grammatical
system
of
the
americans
differs
from
all
others
in
several
points
but
especially
in
the
following
some
nations
in
europe
among
others
the
germans
have
the
power
of
combining
at
pleasure
different
expressions
and
thus
giving
a
complex
sense
to
certain
words
the
indians
have
given
a
most
surprising
extension
to
this
power
so
as
to
arrive
at
the
means
of
connecting
a
great
number
of
ideas
with
a
single
term
this
will
be
easily
understood
with
the
help
of
an
example
quoted
by
duponceau
in
the
memoirs
of
the
philosophical
society
of
america
a
delaware
woman
playing
with
a
cat
or
a
young
dog
says
this
writer
is
heard
to
pronounce
the
word
which
is
thus
composed
is
the
sign
of
the
second
person
and
signifies
or
is
a
part
of
the
word
which
signifies
is
another
fragment
of
the
word
which
means
and
lastly
is
a
diminutive
giving
the
idea
of
smallness
thus
in
one
word
the
indian
woman
has
expressed
pretty
little
paw
take
another
example
of
the
felicity
with
which
the
savages
of
america
have
composed
their
words
a
young
man
of
delaware
is
called
this
word
is
formed
from
chaste
innocent
and
man
man
in
his
purity
and
innocence
this
facility
of
combining
words
is
most
remarkable
in
the
strange
formation
of
their
verbs
the
most
complex
action
is
often
expressed
by
a
single
verb
which
serves
to
convey
all
the
shades
of
an
idea
by
the
modification
of
its
construction
those
who
may
wish
to
examine
more
in
detail
this
subject
which
i
have
only
glanced
at
superficially
should
read
the
correspondence
of
duponceau
and
the
rev

relative
to
the
indian

charlevoix

not

yet
he
exhibits
clearly
enough
in
this
narrative
the
contrast
between
the
european
manners
and
those
of
savages
as
well
as
the
different
way
in
which
the
two
races
of
men
understood
the
sense
of
honor
when
the
french
says
he
seized
upon

which
covered

indians

had
fallen
the
hurons
their
allies
were
greatly
offended
at
this
proceeding
but
without
hesitation
they
set
to
work
in
their
usual
manner
inflicting
horrid
cruelties
upon
the
prisoners
and
devouring
one
of
those
who
had
been
killed
which
made
the
frenchmen
shudder
the
barbarians
prided
themselves
upon
a
scrupulousness
which
they
were
surprised
at
not
finding
in
our
nation
and
could
not
understand
that
there
was
less
to
reprehend
in
the
stripping
of
dead
bodies
than
in
the
devouring
of
their
flesh
like
wild
beasts

describes
the
first
torture
of
which
champlain
was
an
eyewitness
and
the
return
of
the
hurons
into

own
village
having
proceeded
about
eight
leagues
says
he
our
allies
halted
and
having
singled
out
one
of
their
captives
they
reproached
him
with
all
the
cruelties
which
he
had
practised
upon
the
warriors
of
their
nation
who
had
fallen
into
his
hands
and
told
him
that
he
might
expect
to
be
treated
in
like
manner
adding
that
if
he
had
any
spirit
he
would
prove
it
by
singing

immediately
chanted
forth
his
and
then
his
and
all
the
songs
he
knew
in
a
very
mournful
strain
says
champlain
who
was
not
then
aware
that
all
savage
music
has
a
melancholy
character
the
tortures
which
succeeded
accompanied
by
all
the
horrors
which
we
shall
mention
hereafter
terrified
the
french
who
made
every
effort
to
put
a
stop
to
them
but
in
vain
the
following
night
one
of
the
hurons
having
dreamed
that
they
were
pursued
the
retreat
was
changed
to
a
real
flight
and
the
savages
never
stopped
until
they
were
out
of
the
reach
of
danger
the
moment
they
perceived
the
cabins
of
their
own
village
they
cut
themselves
long
sticks
to
which
they
fastened
the
scalps
which
had
fallen
to
their
share
and
carried
them
in
triumph
at
this
sight
the
women
swam
to
the
canoes
where
they
received
the
bloody
scalps
from
the
hands
of
their
husbands
and
tied
them
round
their
necks
the
warriors
offered
one
of
these
horrible
trophies
to
champlain
they
also
presented
him
with
some
bows
and
arrows
the
only
spoils
of
the
iroquois
which
they
had
ventured
to
seize
entreating
him
to

them

although
the
puritanical
strictness
which
presided
over
the
establishment
of
the
english
colonies
in
america
is
now
much
relaxed
remarkable
traces
of
it
are
still
found
in
their
habits
and
their
laws
in
at
the
very
time
when
the
republic
of
france
began
its
ephemeral
existence
the
legislative
body
of
massachusetts
promulgated
the
following
law
to
compel
the
citizens
to
observe
the
sabbath
we
give
the
preamble
and
the
principal
articles
of
this
law
which
is
worthy
of
the
reader
attention
whereas
says
the
legislator
the
observation
of
the
sunday
is
an
affair
of
public
interest
inasmuch
as
it
produces
a
necessary
suspension
of
labor
leads
men
to
reflect
upon
the
duties
of
life
and
the
errors
to
which
human
nature
is
liable
and
provides
for
the
public
and
private
worship
of
god
the
creator
and
governor
of
the
universe
and
for
the
performance
of
such
acts
of
charity
as
are
the
ornament
and
comfort
of
christian
societies
whereas
irreligious
or
persons
forgetting
the
duties
which
the
sabbath
imposes
and
the
benefits
which
these
duties
confer
on
society
are
known
to
profane
its
sanctity
by
following
their
pleasures
or
their
affairs
this
way
of
acting
being
contrary
to
their
own
interest

christians

calculated
to
annoy
those
who
do
not
follow
their
example

it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
that
in
the
chapter
which
has
just
been
read
i
have
not
had
the
intention
of
giving
a
history
of
america
my
only
object
was
to
enable
the
reader
to
appreciate
the
influence
which
the
opinions
and
manners
of
the
first
emigrants
had
exercised
upon
the
fate
of
the
different
colonies
and
of
the
union
in
general
i
have
therefore
confined
myself
to
the
quotation
of
a
few
detached
fragments
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
deceived
but
it
appears
to
me
that
by
pursuing
the
path
which
i
have
merely
pointed
out
it
would
be
easy
to
present
such
pictures
of
the
american
republics
as
would
not
be
unworthy
the
attention
of
the
public
and
could
not
fail
to
suggest
to
the
statesman
matter
for
reflection
not
being
able
to
devote
myself
to
this
labor
i
am
anxious
to
render
it
easy
to
others
and
for
this
purpose
i
subjoin
a
short
catalogue
and
analysis
of
the
works
which
seem
to
me
the
most
important
to
consult
at
the
head

many
relating

stamp
of
truth
and
his
descriptions
are
free
from
false
ornament
this
author
throws
most
valuable
light
upon
the
state
and
condition
of
the
indians
at
the
time
when
north
america
was
first
discovered
the
second
historian
to
consult
is
beverley
who
commences
his
narrative
with
the
year
and
ends
it
with
the
first
part
of
his
book
contains
historical
documents
properly
so
called
relative
to
the
infancy
of
the
colonies
the
second
affords
a
most
curious
picture
of
the
indians
at
this
remote
period
the
third
conveys
very
clear
ideas
concerning
the
manners
social
condition
laws
and
political
customs
of
the
virginians
in
the
author
lifetime
beverley
was
a
native
of
virginia
which
occasions
him
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
his
book
that
he
entreats
his
readers
not
to
exercise
their
critical
severity
upon
it
since
having
been
born
in
the
indies
he
does
not
aspire
to
purity
of
language
notwithstanding
this
colonial
modesty
the
author
shows
throughout
his
book
the
impatience
with
which
he
endures
the
supremacy
of
the
in
this
work
of
beverley
are
also
found
numerous
traces
of
that
spirit
of
civil
liberty
which
animated
the
english
colonies
of
america
at
the
time
when
he
wrote
he
also
shows
the
dissensions
which
existed
among
them
and
retarded
their
independence
beverley
detests
his
catholic
neighbors
of
maryland
even
more
than
he
hates
the
english
government
his
style
is
simple
his
narrative
interesting
and
apparently
trustworthy
i
saw
in
america
another
work
which
ought
to
be
consulted
entitled
the
of
by
william
stith
this
book
affords
some
curious
details
but
thought
it
long
and
diffuse
the
most
ancient
as
well
as
the
best
document
to
be
consulted
on
the
history
of
carolina
is
a
work
in
a
small
quarto
entitled
the
history
of
carolina
by
john
lawson
printed
at
london
in
this
work
contains
in
the
first
part
a
journey
of
discovery
in
the
west
of
carolina
the
account
of
which
given
in
the
form
of
a
journal
is
in
general
confused
and
superficial
but
it
contains
a
very
striking
description
of
the
mortality
caused
among
the
savages
of
that
time
both
by
the
and
the
immoderate
use
of
brandy
and
with
a
curious
picture
of
the
corruption
of
manners
prevalent
among
them
which
was
increased
by
the
presence
of
europeans
the
second
part
of
lawson
book
is
taken
up
with
a
description
of
the
physical
condition
of
carolina
and
its
productions
in
the
third
part
the
author
gives
an
interesting
account
of
the
manners
customs
and
government
of
the
indians
at
that
period
there
is
a
good
deal
of
talent
and
originality
in
this
part
of
the
work
lawson
concludes
his
history
with
a
copy
of
the
charter
granted
to
the
carolinas
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
the
general
tone
of
this
work
is
light
and
often
licentious
forming
a
perfect
contrast
to
the
solemn
style
of
the
works
published
at
the
same
period
in
new
england
history
is
extremely
scarce
in
america
and
can
not
be
procured
in
europe
there
is
however
a
copy
of
it
in
the
royal
library
at
paris
from
the
southern
extremity
of
the
united
states
i
pass
at
once
to
the
northern
limit
as
the
intermediate
space
was
not
peopled
till
a
later
period
i
must
first
point
out
a
very
curious
compilation
entitled
collection
of
the
massachusetts
historical
society
printed
for
the
first
time
at
boston
in
and
reprinted
in
the
collection
of
which
i
speak
and
which
is
continued
to
the
present
day
contains
a
great
number
of
very
valuable
documents
relating
to
the
history
of
the
different
states
of
new
england
among
them
are
letters
which
have
never
been
published
and
authentic
pieces
which
have
been
buried
in
provincial
archives
the
whole
work
of
gookin
concerning
the
indians
is
inserted
there
i
have
mentioned
several
times
in
the
chapter
to
which
this
note
relates
the
work
of
nathaniel
norton
entitled
new
england
memorial
sufficiently
perhaps
to
prove
that
it
deserves
the
attention
of
those
who
would
be
conversant
with
the
history
of
new
england
this
book
is
in
and
was
reprinted
at
boston
in
the
most
valuable
and
important
authority
which
exists
upon
the
history
of
new
england
is
the
work
of
the
rev
cotton
mather
entitled

or
the
ecclesiastical
history

vols
reprinted
at
hartford
united
states
in
a
folio
edition
of
this
work
was
published
in
london
in
the
author
divided
his
work
into
seven
books
the
first
presents
the
history
of
the
events
which
prepared
and
brought
about
the
establishment
of
new
england
the
second
contains
the
lives
of
the
first
governors
and
chief
magistrates
who
presided
over
the
country
the
third
is
devoted
to
the
lives
and
labors
of
the
evangelical
ministers
who
during
the
same
period
had
the
care
of
souls
in
the
fourth
the
author
relates
the
institution
and
progress
of
the
university
of
cambridge
massachusetts
in
the
fifth
he
describes
the
principles
and
the
discipline
of
the
church
of
new
england
the
sixth
is
taken
up
in
retracing
certain
facts
which
in
the
opinion
of
mather
prove
the
merciful
interposition
of
providence
in
behalf
of
the
inhabitants
of
new
england
lastly
in
the
seventh
the
author
gives
an
account
of
the
heresies
and
the
troubles
to
which
the
church
of
new
england
was
exposed
cotton
mather
was
an
evangelical
minister
who
was
born
at
boston
and
passed
his
life
there
his
narratives
are
distinguished
by
the
same
ardor
and
religious
zeal
which
led
to
the
foundation
of
the
colonies
of
new
england
traces
of
bad
taste
sometimes
occur
in
his
manner
of
writing
but
he
interests
because
he
is
full
of
enthusiasm
he
is
often
intolerant
still
oftener
credulous
but
he
never
betrays
an
intention
to
deceive
sometimes
his
book
contains
fine
passages
and
true
and
profound
reflections
such
as
the
following
before
the
arrival
of
the
puritans
says
he
vol
chap
iv
there
were
more
than
a
few
attempts
of
the
english
to
people
and
improve
the
parts
of
new
england
which
were
to
the
northward
of
new
plymouth
but
the
design
of
those
attempts
being
aimed
no
higher
than
the
advancement
of
some
worldly
interests
a
constant
series
of
disasters
has
confounded
them
until
there
was
a
plantation
erected
upon
the
nobler
designs
of
christianity
and
that
plantation
though
it
has
had
more
adversaries
than
perhaps
any
one
upon
earth
yet
having
obtained
help
from
god
it
continues
to
this
day
mather
occasionally
relieves
the
austerity
of
his
descriptions
with
images
full
of
tender
feeling
after
having
spoken
of
an
english
lady
whose
religious
ardor
had
brought
her
to
america
with
her
husband
and
who
soon
after
sank
under
the
fatigues
and
privations
of
exile
he
adds
as
for
her
virtuous
husband
isaac
johnson
he
tried
to
live
without
her
liked
it
not
and
vol
i
mather
work
gives
an
admirable
picture
of
the
time
and
country
which
he
describes
in
his
account
of
the
motives
which
led
the
puritans
to
seek
an
asylum
beyond
seas
he
says
the
god
of
heaven
served
as
it
were
a
summons
upon
the
spirits
of
his
people
in
the
english
nation
stirring
up
the
spirits
of
thousands
which
never
saw
the
faces
of
each
other
with
a
most
unanimous
inclination
to
leave
the
pleasant
accommodations
of
their
native
country
and
go
over
a
terrible
ocean
into
a
more
terrible
desert
for
the
pure
enjoyment
of
all
his
ordinances
it
is
now
reasonable
that
before
we
pass
any
farther
the
reasons
of
this
undertaking
should
be
more
exactly
made
known
unto
posterity
especially
unto
the
posterity
of
those
that
were
the
undertakers
lest
they
come
at
length
to
forget
and
neglect
the
true
interest
of
new
england
wherefore
i
shall
now
transcribe
some
of
them
from
a
manuscript
wherein
they
were
then
tendered
unto
consideration
considerations
for
the
plantation
of
new
first
it
will
be
a
service
unto
the
church
of
great
consequence
to
carry
the
gospel
unto
those
parts
of
the
world
and
raise
a
bulwark
against
the
kingdom
of
antichrist
which
the
jesuits
labor
to
rear
up
in
all
parts
of
the
world
secondly
all
other
churches
of
europe
have
been
brought
under
desolations
and
it
may
be
feared
that
the
like
judgments
are
coming
upon
us
and
who
knows
but
god
hath
provided
this
place
to
be
a
refuge
for
many
whom
he
means
to
save
out
of
the
general
destruction
thirdly
the
land
grows
weary
of
her
inhabitants
inasmuch
that
man
which
is
the
most
precious
of
all
creatures
is
here
more
vile
and
base
than
the
earth
he
treads
upon
children
neighbors
and
friends
especially
the
poor
are
counted
the
greatest
burdens
which
if
things
were
right
would
be
the
chiefest
of
earthly
blessings
fourthly
we
are
grown
to
that
intemperance
in
all
excess
of
riot
as
no
mean
estate
almost
will
suffice
a
man
to
keep
sail
with
his
equals
and
he
that
fails
in
it
must
live
in
scorn
and
contempt
hence
it
comes
to
pass
that
all
arts
and
trades
are
carried
in
that
deceitful
manner
and
unrighteous
course
as
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
good
upright
man
to
maintain
his
constant
charge
and
live
comfortably
in
them
fifthly
the
schools
of
learning
and
religion
are
so
corrupted
as
beside
the
unsupportable
charge
of
education
most
children
even
the
best
wittiest
and
of
the
fairest
hopes
are
prevented
corrupted
and
utterly
overthrown
by
the
multitude
of
evil
examples
and
licentious
behaviors
in
these
seminaries
sixthly
the
whole
earth
is
the
lord
garden
and
he
hath
given
it
to
the
sons
of
adam
to
be
tilled
and
improved
by
them
why
then
should
we
stand
starving
here
for
places
of
habitation
and
in
the
mean
time
suffer
whole
countries
as
profitable
for
the
use
of
man
to
lie
waste
without
any
improvement
seventhly
what
can
be
a
better
or
a
nobler
work
and
more
worthy
of
a
christian
than
to
erect
and
support
a
reformed
particular
church
in
its
infancy
and
unite
our
forces
with
such
a
company
of
faithful
people
as
by
timely
assistance
may
grow
stronger
and
prosper
but
for
want
of
it
may
be
put
to
great
hazards
if
not
be
wholly
ruined
eighthly
if
any
such
as
are
known
to
be
godly
and
live
in
wealth
and
prosperity
here
shall
forsake
all
this
to
join
with
this
reformed
church
and
with
it
run
the
hazard
of
a
hard
and
mean
condition
it
will
be
an
example
of
great
use
both
for
the
removing
of
scandal
and
to
give
more
life
unto
the
faith
of
god
people
in
their
prayers
for
the
plantation
and
also
to
encourage
others
to
join
the
more
willingly
in
it
farther
on
when
he
declares
the
principles
of
the
church
of
new
england
with
respect
to
morals
mather
inveighs
with
violence
against
the
custom
of
drinking
healths
at
table
which
he
denounces
as
a
pagan
and
abominable
practice
he
proscribes
with
the
same
rigor
all
ornaments
for
the
hair
used
by
the
female
sex
as
well
as
their
custom
of
having
the
arms
and
neck
uncovered
in
another
part
of
his
work
he
relates
several
instances
of
witchcraft
which
had
alarmed
new
england
it
is
plain
that
the
visible
action
of
the
devil
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
appeared
to
him
an
incontestible
and
evident
fact
this
work
of
cotton
mather
displays
in
many
places
the
spirit
of
civil
liberty
and
political
independence
which
characterized
the
times
in
which
he
lived
their
principles
respecting
government
are
discoverable
at
every
page
thus
for
instance
the
inhabitants
of
massachusetts
in
the
year
ten
years
after
the
foundation
of
plymouth
are
found
to
have
devoted
sterling
to
the
establishment
of
the
university
of
cambridge
in
passing
from
the
general
documents
relative
to
the
history
of
new
england
to
those
which
describe
the
several
states
comprised
within
its
limits
i
ought
first
to
notice
the
history
of
the
colony
of
massachusetts
by
hutchinson
of
the
massachusetts
province
the
history
of
hutchinson
which
i
have
several
times
quoted
in
the
chapter
to
which
this
note
relates
commences
in
the
year
and
ends
in
throughout
the
work
there
is
a
striking
air
of
truth
and
the
greatest
simplicity
of
style
it
is
full
of
minute
details
the
best
history
to
consult
concerning
connecticut
is
that
of
benjamin
trumbull
entitled
a
complete
history
of
connecticut
civil
and
ecclesiastical
printed
in
at
new
haven
this
history
contains
a
clear
and
calm
account
of
all
the
events
which
happened
in
connecticut
during
the
period
given
in
the
title
the
author
drew
from
the
best
sources
and
his
narrative
bears
the
stamp
of
truth
all
that
he
says
of
the
early
days
of
connecticut
is
extremely
curious
see
especially
the
constitution
of
vol
ch
and
also
the
penal
laws
of
connecticut
vol
ch
the
history
of
new
hampshire
by
jeremy
belknap
is
a
work
held
in
merited
estimation
it
was
printed
at
boston
in
in
the
third
chapter
of
the
first
volume
is
particularly
worthy
of
attention
for
the
valuable
details
it
affords
on
the
political
and
religious
principles
of
the
puritans
on
the
causes
of
their
emigration
and
on
their
laws
the
following
curious
quotation
is
given
from
a
sermon
delivered
in
it
concerneth
new
england
always
to
remember
that
they
are
a
plantation
religious
not
a
plantation
of
trade
the
profession
of
the
purity
of
doctrine
worship
and
discipline
is
written
on
her
forehead
let
merchants
and
such
as
are
increasing
cent
per
cent
remember
this
that
worldly
gain
was
not
the
end
and
design
of
the
people
of
new
england
but
religion
and
if
any
man
among
us
make
religion
as
twelve
and
the
world
as
thirteen
such
an
one
hath
not
the
true
spirit
of
a
true
new
englishman
the
reader
of
belknap
will
find
in
his
work
more
general
ideas
and
more
strength
of
thought
than
are
to
be
met
with
in
the
american
historians
even
to
the
present
day
among
the
central
states
which
deserve
our
attention
for
their
remote
origin
new
york
and
pennsylvania
are
the
foremost
the
best
history
we
have
of
the
former
is
entitled
a
history
of
new
york
by
william
smith
printed
in
london
in
smith
gives
us
important
details
of
the
wars
between
the
french
and
english
in
america
his
is
the
best
account
of
the
famous
confederation
of
the
iroquois
with
respect
to
pennsylvania
i
can
not
do
better
than
point
out
the
work
of
proud
entitled
the
history
of
pennsylvania
from
the
original
institution
and
settlement
of
that
province
under
the
first
proprietor
and
governor
william
penn
in
till
after
the
year
by
robert
proud
printed
at
philadelphia
in
this
work
is
deserving
of
the
especial
attention
of
the
reader
it
contains
a
mass
of
curious
documents
concerning
penn
the
doctrine
of
the
quakers
and
the
character
manners
and
customs
of
the
first
inhabitants
of
pennsylvania
appendix
page
we
read
in
jefferson
memoirs
as
follows
at
the
time
of
the
first
settlement
of
the
english
in
virginia
when
land
was
had
for
little
or
nothing
some
provident
persons
having
obtained
large
grants
of
it
and
being
desirous
of
maintaining
the
splendor
of
their
families
entailed
their
property
upon
their
descendants
the
transmission
of
these
estates
from
generation
to
generation
to
men
who
bore
the
same
name
had
the
effect
of
raising
up
a
distinct
class
of
families
who
possessing
by
law
the
privilege
of
perpetuating
their
wealth
formed
by
these
means
a
sort
of
patrician
order
distinguished
by
the
grandeur
and
luxury
of
their
establishments
from
this
order
it
was
that
the
king
usually
chose
his
counsellor
of
state
this
passage
is
extracted
and
translated
from
work
upon
the
life
of
jefferson
entitled
politiques
et
philosophiques
de
in
the
united
states
the
principal
clauses
of
the
english
law
respecting
descent
have
been
universally
rejected
the
first
rule
that
we
follow
says
kent
touching
inheritance
is
the
following
if
a
man
dies
intestate
his
property
goes
to
his
heirs
in
a
direct
line
if
he
has
but
one
heir
or

was
never
introduced
those
states
which
thought
proper
to
preserve
the
english
law
of
entail
modified
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
deprive
it
of
its
most
aristocratic
tendencies
our
general
principles
on
the
subject
of
government
says
kent
tend
to
favor
the
free
circulation
of
property
it
can
not
fail
to
strike
the
french
reader
who
studies
the
law
of
inheritance
that
on
these
questions
the
french
legislation
is
infinitely
more
democratic
even
than
the
american
the
american
law
makes
an
equal
division
of
the
father
property
but
only
in
the
case
of
his
will
not
being
known
for
every
man
says
the
law
in
the
state
of
new
york
revised

has
entire
liberty
power
and
authority
to
dispose
of
his
property
by
will
to
leave
it
entire
or
divided
in
favor
of
any
persons
he
chooses
as
his
heirs
provided
he
do
not
leave
it
to
a
political
body
or
any
corporation
the
french
law
obliges
the
testator
to
divide
his
property
equally
or
nearly
so
among
his
heirs
most
of
the
american
republics
still
admit
of
entails
under
certain
restrictions
but
the
french
law
prohibits
entail
in
all
cases
if
the
social
condition
of
the
americans
is
more
democratic
than
that
of

the
laws
of

are
the

there
is
no

beside
that

this

of

a
necessary
consequence
of

begin
with
the
most
important
of
all
the
laws
that
which
decides
the
order

to

what
can
be
more
immutable
in
its
principle
than
a
political
order
founded
upon
the
natural
succession
of
father
to
son
in
louis

had
established
the
perpetual
law
of
hereditary
succession
in

of
his

consequences
of

of
followed
his
example
they
merely
established
the
perpetuity
of

in

of
another

in
this
respect
they
imitated
the
chancellor
maurepas
who
when
he
erected
the
new
parliament
upon
the
ruins
of
the
old
took
care
to
declare
in

ordinance
that
the
rights
of
the

magistrates
should
be
as
inalienable
as
those
of
their
predecessors
had
been
the
laws
of
like
those
of
point
out
no
way
of
changing
the
constitution
and
it
is
evident
that
the
ordinary
means
of
legislation
are
insufficient
for
this
purpose
as
the
king
peers
and
deputies
all
derive
their
authority
from
the
constitution
these
three
powers
united
can
not
alter
a
law
by
virtue
of
which
alone
they
govern
out
of
the
pale
of
the
constitution
they
are
nothing
where
then
could
they
take
their
stand
to
effect
a
change
in
its
provisions
the
alternative
is
clear
either
their
efforts
are
powerless
against
the
charter
which
continues
to
exist
in
spite
of
them
in
which
case
they
only
reign
in
the
name
of
the
charter
or
they
succeed
in
changing
the
charter
and
then
the
law
by
which
they
existed
being
annulled
they
themselves
cease
to
exist
by
destroying
the
charter
they
destroy
themselves
this
is
much
more
evident
in
the
laws
of
than
in
those
of
in
the
royal
prerogative
took
its
stand
above
and
beyond
the
constitution
but
in
it
was
avowedly
created
by
and
dependant
on
the
constitution
a
part
therefore
of
the
french
constitution
is
immutable
because
it
is
united
to
the
destiny
of
a
family
and
the
body
of
the
constitution
is
equally
immutable
because
there
appear
to
be
no
legal
means
of
changing
it

the
federal
constitution
has
introduced
the
jury
into
the
tribunals
of
the
union
in
the
same
way
as
the
states
had
introduced
it
into
their
own
several
courts
but
as
it
has
not
established
any
fixed
rules
for
the
choice
of
jurors
the
federal
courts
select
them
from
the
ordinary
which
each
state
makes
for
itself
the
laws
of
the
states
must
therefore
be
examined
for
the
theory
of
the
formation
of
juries

see
also
the
federal
laws
of

years
and
upon
the
subject
for
the
purpose
of
thoroughly
understanding
the
american
principles
with
respect
to
the
formation
of
juries
i
examined
the
laws
of
states
at
a
distance
from
one
another
and
the
following
observations
were
the
result
of
my
inquiries
in
america
all
the
citizens
who
exercise
the
elective
franchise
have
the
right
of
serving
upon
a
jury
the
great
state
of
new
york
however
has
made
a
slight
difference
between
the
two
privileges
but
in
a
spirit
contrary
to
that
of
the
laws
of
france
for
in
the
state
of
new
york
there
are
fewer
persons
eligible
as
jurymen
than
there
are
electors
it
may
be
said
in
general
that
the
right
of
forming
part
of
a
jury
like
that
of
electing
representatives
is
open
to
all
the
citizens
the
exercise
of
this
right
however
is
not
put
indiscriminately
into
any
hands
every
year
a
body
of
municipal
or
county
magistrates
called
in
new
england
in
new
york
in
ohio
and
of
the
in
louisiana
choose
for
each
county
a
certain
number
of
citizens
who
have
the
right
of
serving
as
jurymen
and
who
we
supposed
to
be
capable
of
exercising
their
functions
these
magistrates
being
themselves
elective
excite
no
distrust
their
powers
like
those
of
most
republican
magistrates
are
very
extensive
and
very
arbitrary
and
they
frequently
make
use
of
them
to
remove
unworthy
or
incompetent
jurymen
the
names
of
the
jurymen
thus
chosen
are
transmitted
to
the
county
court
and
the
jury
who
have
to
decide
any
affair
are
drawn
by
lot
from
the
whole
list
of
names
the
americans
have
contrived
in
every
way
to
make
the
common
people
eligible
to
the
jury
and
to
render
the
service
as
little
onerous
as
possible
the
sessions
are
held
in
the
chief
town
of
every
county
and
the
jury
are
indemnified
for
their
attendance
either
by
the
state
or
the
parties
concerned
they
receive
in
general
a
dollar
per
day
beside
their
travelling
expenses
in
america
the
being
placed
upon
the
jury
is
looked
upon
as
a
burden
but
it
is
a
burden
which
is
very
supportable

if
we
attentively
examine
the
constitution
of
the
jury
as
introduced
into
civil
proceedings
in
england
we
shall
readily
perceive
that
the
jurors
are
under
the
immediate
control
of
the
judge
it
is
true
that
the
verdict
of
the
jury
in
civil
as
well
as
in
criminal
cases
comprises
the
question
of
fact
and
the
question
of
right
in
the
same
reply
thus
a
house
is
claimed
by
peter
as
having
been
purchased
by
him
this
is
the
fact
to
be
decided
the
defendant
puts
in
a
plea
of
incompetency
on
the
part
of
the
vendor
this
is
the
legal
question
to
be
resolved
but
the
jury
do
not
enjoy
the
same
character
of
infallibility
in
civil
cases
according
to
the
practice
of
the
english
courts
as
they
do
in
criminal
cases
the
judge
may
refuse
to
receive
the
verdict
and
even
after
the
first
trial
has
taken
place
a
second
or
new
trial
may
be
awarded
by
the
court
