appeal
to
the
christian
women
of
the
south
by
grimké
then
mordecai
commanded
to
answer
esther
think
not
within
thyself
that
thou
shalt
escape
in
the
king
house
more
than
all
the
jews
for
if
thou
altogether
holdest
thy
peace
at
this
time
then
shall
there
enlargement
and
deliverance
arise
to
the
jews
from
another
place
but
thou
and
thy
father
house
shall
be
destroyed
and
who
knoweth
whether
thou
art
come
to
the
kingdom
for
such
a
time
as
this
and
esther
bade
them
return
mordecai
this
answer
and
so
will
i
go
in
unto
the
king
which
is
not
according
to
law
and
i
perish
i
esther
iv
respected
friends
it
is
because
i
feel
a
deep
and
tender
interest
in
your
present
and
eternal
welfare
that
i
am
willing
thus
publicly
to
address
you
some
of
you
have
loved
me
as
a
relative
and
some
have
felt
bound
to
me
in
christian
sympathy
and
gospel
fellowship
and
even
when
compelled
by
a
strong
sense
of
duty
to
break
those
outward
bonds
of
union
which
bound
us
together
as
members
of
the
same
community
and
members
of
the
same
religious
denomination
you
were
generous
enough
to
give
me
credit
for
sincerity
as
a
christian
though
you
believed
i
had
been
most
strangely
deceived
i
thanked
you
then
for
your
kindness
and
i
ask
you
for
the
sake
of
former
confidence
and
former
friendship
to
read
the
following
pages
in
the
spirit
of
calm
investigation
and
fervent
prayer
it
is
because
you
have
known
me
that
i
write
thus
unto
you
but
there
are
other
christian
women
scattered
over
the
southern
states
a
very
large
number
of
whom
have
never
seen
me
and
never
heard
my
name
and
who
feel
interest
whatever
in
but
i
feel
an
interest
in
as
branches
of
the
same
vine
from
whose
root
i
daily
draw
the
principle
of
spiritual
vitality
yes
sisters
in
christ
i
feel
an
interest
in
and
often
has
the
secret
prayer
arisen
on
your
behalf
lord
open
thou
their
eyes
that
they
may
see
wondrous
things
out
of
thy
law
it
is
then
because
i
and
for
you
that
i
thus
address
you
upon
a
subject
about
which
of
all
others
perhaps
you
would
rather
not
hear
any
thing
but
would
to
god
ye
could
bear
with
me
a
little
in
my
folly
and
indeed
bear
with
me
for
i
am
jealous
over
you
with
godly
jealousy
be
not
afraid
then
to
read
my
appeal
it
is
written
in
the
heat
of
passion
or
prejudice
but
in
that
solemn
calmness
which
is
the
result
of
conviction
and
duty
it
is
true
i
am
going
to
tell
you
unwelcome
truths
but
i
mean
to
speak
those
in
and
remember
solomon
says
faithful
are
the
of
a
friend
i
do
not
believe
the
time
has
yet
come
when
will
not
endure
sound
doctrine
even
on
the
subject
of
slavery
if
it
is
spoken
to
them
in
tenderness
and
love
therefore
i
now
address
to
all
of
you
then
known
or
unknown
relatives
or
strangers
for
you
are
all
in
christ
i
would
speak
i
have
felt
for
you
at
this
time
when
unwelcome
light
is
pouring
in
upon
the
world
on
the
subject
of
slavery
light
which
even
christians
would
exclude
if
they
could
from
our
country
or
at
any
rate
from
the
southern
portion
of
it
saying
as
its
rays
strike
the
rock
bound
coasts
of
new
england
and
scatter
their
warmth
and
radiance
over
her
hills
and
valleys
and
from
thence
travel
onward
over
the
palisades
of
the
hudson
and
down
the
soft
flowing
waters
of
the
delaware
and
gild
the
waves
of
the
potomac
hitherto
shalt
thou
come
and
no
further
i
know
that
even
professors
of
his
name
who
has
been
emphatically
called
the
light
of
the
world
would
if
they
could
build
a
wall
of
adamant
around
the
southern
states
whose
top
might
reach
unto
heaven
in
order
to
shut
out
the
light
which
is
bounding
from
mountain
to
mountain
and
from
the
hills
to
the
plains
and
valleys
beneath
through
the
vast
extent
of
our
northern
states
but
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
their
attempts
will
be
as
utterly
fruitless
as
were
the
efforts
of
the
builders
of
babel
and
why
because
moral
like
natural
light
is
so
extremely
subtle
in
its
nature
as
to
overleap
all
human
barriers
and
laugh
at
the
puny
efforts
of
man
to
control
it
all
the
excuses
and
palliations
of
this
system
must
inevitably
be
swept
away
just
as
other
refuges
of
lies
have
been
by
the
irresistible
torrent
of
a
rectified
public
opinion
the
of
the
slave
system
says
jonathan
dymond
in
his
admirable
work
on
the
principles
of
morality
will
be
regarded
with
the
public
feeling
as
he
who
was
an
advocate
for
the
slave
trade
it
will
be
and
that
very
soon
clearly
perceived
and
fully
acknowledged
by
all
the
virtuous
and
the
candid
that
in
it
is
as
sinful
to
hold
a
human
being
in
bondage
who
has
been
born
in
carolina
as
one
who
has
been
born
in
africa
all
that
sophistry
of
argument
which
has
been
employed
to
prove
that
although
it
is
sinful
to
send
to
africa
to
procure
men
and
women
as
slaves
who
have
never
been
in
slavery
that
still
it
is
not
sinful
to
keep
those
in
bondage
who
have
come
down
by
inheritance
will
be
utterly
overthrown
we
must
come
back
to
the
good
old
doctrine
of
our
forefathers
who
declared
to
the
world
this
self
evident
truth
that
men
are
created
equal
and
that
they
have
certain
rights
among
which
are
life
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
it
is
even
a
greater
absurdity
to
suppose
a
man
can
be
legally
born
a
slave
under
free
government
than
under
the
petty
despotisms
of
barbarian
africa
if
then
we
have
no
right
to
enslave
an
african
surely
we
can
have
none
to
enslave
an
american
if
it
is
a
self
evident
truth
that
men
every
where
and
of
every
color
are
born
equal
and
have
an
right
to
then
it
is
equally
true
that
man
can
be
born
a
slave
and
no
man
can
ever
be
reduced
to
bondage
and
held
as
a
slave
however
fair
may
be
the
claim
of
his
master
or
mistress
through
wills
and
but
after
all
it
may
be
said
our
fathers
were
certainly
mistaken
for
the
bible
sanctions
slavery
and
that
is
the
highest
authority
now
the
bible
is
my
ultimate
appeal
in
all
matters
of
faith
and
practice
and
it
is
to
i
am
anxious
to
bring
the
subject
at
issue
between
us
let
us
then
begin
with
adam
and
examine
the
charter
of
privileges
which
was
given
to
him
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
in
the
eighth
psalm
we
have
a
still
fuller
description
of
this
charter
which
through
adam
was
given
to
all
mankind
thou
madest
him
to
have
dominion
over
the
works
of
thy
hands
thou
hast
put
all
things
under
his
feet
all
sheep
and
oxen
yea
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
fowl
of
the
air
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
whatsoever
passeth
through
the
paths
of
the
seas
and
after
the
flood
when
this
charter
of
human
rights
was
renewed
we
find
power
vested
in
man
and
the
fear
of
you
and
the
dread
of
you
shall
be
upon
every
beast
of
the
earth
and
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
upon
all
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
and
upon
all
the
fishes
of
the
sea
into
your
hand
are
they
delivered
in
this
charter
although
the
different
kinds
of
beings
are
so
particularly
enumerated
and
supreme
dominion
over
of
is
granted
yet
is
vested
with
this
dominion
his
fellow
man
he
was
never
told
that
any
of
the
human
species
were
put
his
feet
it
was
only
and
man
who
was
created
in
the
image
of
his
maker
can
properly
be
termed
a
though
the
laws
of
slave
states
do
call
him
a
chattel
personal
then
i
assert
was
put
the
feet
of
by
that
first
charter
of
human
rights
which
was
given
by
god
to
the
fathers
of
the
antediluvian
and
postdiluvian
worlds
therefore
this
doctrine
of
equality
is
based
on
the
bible
but
it
may
be
argued
that
in
the
very
chapter
of
genesis
from
which
i
have
last
quoted
will
be
found
the
curse
pronounced
upon
canaan
by
which
his
posterity
was
consigned
to
servitude
under
his
brothers
shem
and
japheth
i
know
this
prophecy
was
uttered
and
was
most
fearfully
and
wonderfully
fulfilled
through
the
immediate
descendants
of
canaan
the
canaanites
and
i
do
not
know
but
it
has
been
through
all
the
children
of
ham
but
i
do
know
that
prophecy
does
tell
us
what
to
but
what
actually
does
take
place
ages
after
it
has
been
delivered
and
that
if
we
justify
america
for
enslaving
the
children
of
africa
we
must
also
justify
egypt
for
reducing
the
children
of
israel
to
bondage
for
the
latter
was
foretold
as
explicitly
as
the
former
i
am
well
aware
that
prophecy
has
often
been
urged
as
an
excuse
for
slavery
but
be
not
deceived
the
fulfilment
of
prophecy
will
cover
one
in
the
awful
day
of
account
hear
what
our
saviour
says
on
this
subject
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
come
but
unto
that
man
through
whom
they
come
witness
some
fulfilment
of
this
declaration
in
the
tremendous
destruction
of
jerusalem
occasioned
by
that
most
nefarious
of
all
crimes
the
crucifixion
of
the
son
of
god
did
the
fact
of
that
event
having
been
foretold
exculpate
the
jews
from
sin
in
perpetrating
it
no
for
hear
what
the
apostle
peter
says
to
them
on
this
subject
him
being
delivered
by
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
of
god
have
taken
and
by
hands
have
crucified
and
slain
other
striking
instances
might
be
adduced
but
these
will
suffice
but
it
has
been
urged
that
the
patriarchs
held
slaves
and
therefore
slavery
is
right
do
you
really
believe
that
patriarchal
servitude
was
like
american
slavery
can
you
believe
it
if
so
read
the
history
of
these
primitive
fathers
of
the
church
and
be
undeceived
look
at
abraham
though
so
great
a
man
going
to
the
herd
himself
and
fetching
a
calf
from
thence
and
serving
it
up
with
his
own
hands
for
the
entertainment
of
his
guests
look
at
sarah
that
princess
as
her
name
signifies
baking
cakes
upon
the
hearth
if
the
servants
they
had
were
like
southern
slaves
would
they
have
performed
such
comparatively
menial
offices
for
themselves
hear
too
the
plaintive
lamentation
of
abraham
when
he
feared
he
should
have
no
son
to
bear
his
name
down
to
posterity
behold
thou
hast
given
me
no
seed
c
one
born
in
my
house
heir
from
this
it
appears
that
one
of
his
was
to
inherit
his
immense
estate
is
this
like
southern
slavery
i
leave
it
to
your
own
good
sense
and
candor
to
decide
besides
such
was
the
footing
upon
which
abraham
was
with
servants
that
he
trusted
them
with
arms
are
slaveholders
willing
to
put
swords
and
pistols
into
the
hands
of
their
slaves
he
was
as
a
father
among
his
servants
what
are
planters
and
masters
generally
among
theirs
when
the
institution
of
circumcision
was
established
abraham
was
commanded
thus
he
that
is
eight
days
old
shall
be
circumcised
among
you
in
your
generations
he
that
is
born
in
the
house
or
bought
with
money
of
any
stranger
which
is
not
of
thy
seed
and
to
render
this
command
with
regard
to
his
still
more
impressive
it
is
repeated
in
the
very
next
verse
and
herein
we
may
perceive
the
great
care
which
was
taken
by
god
to
guard
the
of
even
under
this
dark
dispensation
what
too
was
the
testimony
given
to
the
faithfulness
of
this
eminent
patriarch
for
i
know
him
that
he
will
command
his
children
and
his
after
him
and
they
shall
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
to
do
justice
and
judgment
now
my
dear
friends
many
of
you
believe
that
circumcision
has
been
superseded
by
baptism
in
the
church
careful
to
have
that
are
born
in
your
house
or
bought
with
money
of
any
stranger
baptized
are
as
faithful
as
abraham
to
command
household
to
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
i
leave
it
to
your
own
consciences
to
decide
was
patriarchal
servitude
then
like
american
slavery
but
i
shall
be
told
god
sanctioned
slavery
yea
commanded
slavery
under
the
jewish
dispensation
let
us
examine
this
subject
calmly
and
prayerfully
i
admit
that
a
species
of
was
permitted
to
the
jews
but
in
studying
the
subject
i
have
been
struck
with
wonder
and
admiration
at
perceiving
how
carefully
the
servant
was
guarded
from
violence
injustice
and
wrong
i
will
first
inform
you
how
these
servants
became
servants
for
i
think
this
a
very
important
part
of
our
subject
from
consulting
horne
calmet
and
the
bible
i
find
there
were
six
different
ways
by
which
the
hebrews
became
servants
legally
if
reduced
to
extreme
poverty
a
hebrew
might
sell
himself
his
services
for
six
years
in
which
case
received
the
purchase
money
lev
xxv
a
father
might
sell
his
children
as
servants
his
in
which
circumstance
it
was
understood
the
daughter
was
to
be
the
wife
or
of
the
man
who
bought
her
and
the
received
the
price
in
other
words
jewish
women
were
sold
as
were
in
the
first
settlement
of
virginia
as
as
slaves
ex
xxi
insolvent
debtors
might
be
delivered
to
their
creditors
as
servants
kings
iv
thieves
not
able
to
make
restitution
for
their
thefts
were
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
injured
person
ex
xxii
they
might
be
born
in
servitude
ex
xxi
if
a
hebrew
had
sold
himself
to
a
rich
gentile
he
might
be
redeemed
by
one
of
his
brethren
at
any
time
the
money
was
offered
and
he
who
redeemed
him
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
favor
thus
conferred
and
rule
over
him
with
rigor
lev
xxv
before
going
into
an
examination
of
the
laws
by
which
these
servants
were
protected
i
would
just
ask
whether
american
slaves
have
become
slaves
in
any
of
the
ways
in
which
the
hebrews
became
servants
did
they
sell
themselves
into
slavery
and
receive
the
purchase
money
into
their
own
hands
no
did
they
become
insolvent
and
by
their
own
imprudence
subject
themselves
to
be
sold
as
slaves
no
did
they
steal
the
property
of
another
and
were
they
sold
to
make
restitution
for
their
crimes
no
did
their
present
masters
as
an
act
of
kindness
redeem
them
from
some
heathen
tyrant
to
whom
had
sold
in
the
dark
hour
of
adversity
no
were
they
born
in
slavery
no
no
not
according
to
for
the
servants
who
were
born
in
servitude
among
them
were
born
of
parents
who
had
for
six
years
ex
xxi
were
the
female
slaves
of
the
south
sold
by
their
fathers
how
shall
i
answer
this
question
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
never
were
fathers
have
received
the
poor
compensation
of
silver
or
gold
for
the
tears
and
toils
the
suffering
and
anguish
and
hopeless
bondage
of
daughters
they
labor
day
by
day
and
year
by
year
side
by
side
in
the
same
field
if
haply
their
daughters
are
permitted
to
remain
on
the
same
plantation
with
them
instead
of
being
as
they
often
are
separated
from
their
parents
and
sold
into
distant
states
never
again
to
meet
on
earth
but
do
the
of
the
south
ever
sell
their
my
heart
beats
and
my
hand
trembles
as
i
write
the
awful
affirmative
yes
the
fathers
of
this
christian
land
often
sell
their
daughters
as
jewish
parents
did
to
be
the
wives
and
of
the
man
who
buys
them
but
to
be
the
abject
slaves
of
petty
tyrants
and
irresponsible
masters
is
it
not
so
my
friends
i
leave
it
to
your
own
candor
to
corroborate
my
assertion
southern
slaves
then
have
become
slaves
in
any
of
the
six
different
ways
in
which
hebrews
became
servants
and
i
hesitate
not
to
say
that
american
masters
according
to
substantiate
their
claim
to
the
men
women
or
children
they
now
hold
in
bondage
but
there
was
one
way
in
which
a
jew
might
illegally
be
reduced
to
servitude
it
was
this
he
might
be
and
afterwards
sold
as
a
slave
as
was
joseph
to
guard
most
effectually
against
this
dreadful
crime
of
manstealing
god
enacted
this
severe
law
he
that
stealeth
a
man
and
selleth
him
or
if
he
be
found
in
his
hand
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
as
i
have
tried
american
slavery
by
hebrew
servitude
and
found
to
your
surprise
perhaps
that
jewish
law
can
not
justify
the
slaveholder
claim
let
us
now
try
it
by
hebrew
bondage
have
the
southern
slaves
then
been
stolen
if
they
did
not
sell
themselves
into
bondage
if
they
were
not
sold
as
insolvent
debtors
or
as
thieves
if
they
were
not
redeemed
from
a
heathen
master
to
whom
had
sold
if
they
were
not
born
in
servitude
according
to
hebrew
law
and
if
the
females
were
not
sold
by
their
fathers
as
wives
and
to
those
who
purchased
them
then
what
shall
we
say
of
them
what
can
we
say
of
them
but
that
according
hebrew
law
they
have
been
but
i
shall
be
told
that
the
jews
had
other
servants
who
were
absolute
slaves
let
us
look
a
little
into
this
also
they
had
other
servants
who
were
procured
in
two
different
ways
captives
taken
in
war
were
reduced
to
bondage
instead
of
being
killed
but
we
are
not
told
that
their
children
were
enslaved
deut
xx
bondmen
and
bondmaids
might
be
bought
from
the
heathen
round
about
them
these
were
left
by
fathers
to
their
children
after
them
but
it
does
not
appear
that
the
of
these
servants
ever
were
reduced
to
servitude
lev
xxv
i
will
now
try
the
right
of
the
southern
planter
by
the
claims
of
hebrew
masters
over
their
slaves
were
the
southern
slaves
taken
captive
in
war
no
were
they
bought
from
the
heathen
no
for
surely
no
one
will
vindicate
the
so
far
as
to
assert
that
slaves
were
bought
from
the
heathen
who
were
obtained
by
that
system
of
piracy
the
excuse
for
holding
southern
slaves
is
that
they
were
born
in
slavery
but
we
have
seen
that
they
were
born
in
servitude
as
jewish
servants
were
and
that
the
children
of
heathen
slaves
were
not
legally
subjected
to
bondage
even
under
the
mosaic
law
how
then
have
the
slaves
of
the
south
been
obtained
i
will
next
proceed
to
an
examination
of
those
laws
which
were
enacted
in
order
to
protect
the
hebrew
and
the
heathen
servant
for
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
are
protected
by
him
of
whom
it
is
said
his
mercies
are
over
his
works
i
will
first
speak
of
those
which
secured
the
rights
of
hebrew
servants
this
code
was
headed
thus
thou
shalt
rule
over
him
with
but
shalt
fear
thy
god
if
thou
buy
a
hebrew
servant
six
years
shall
he
serve
and
in
the
seventh
year
he
shall
go
out
free
for
nothing
ex
xxi
if
he
come
in
by
himself
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
if
he
were
married
then
his
wife
shall
go
out
with
him
if
his
master
have
given
him
a
wife
and
she
have
borne
him
sons
and
daughters
the
wife
and
her
children
shall
be
his
master
and
he
shall
go
out
by
himself
if
the
servant
shall
plainly
say
i
love
my
master
my
wife
and
my
children
i
will
not
go
out
free
then
his
master
shall
bring
him
unto
the
judges
and
he
shall
bring
him
to
the
door
or
unto
the
and
his
master
shall
bore
his
ear
through
with
an
awl
and
he
shall
serve
him
ex
xxi
if
a
man
smite
the
eye
of
his
servant
or
the
eye
of
his
maid
that
it
perish
he
shall
let
him
go
for
his
eye
sake
and
if
he
smite
out
his
man
servant
tooth
or
his
maid
servant
tooth
he
shall
let
him
go
for
his
tooth
sake
ex
xxi
on
the
sabbath
rest
was
secured
to
servants
by
the
fourth
commandment
ex
xx
servants
were
permitted
to
unite
with
their
masters
three
times
in
every
year
in
celebrating
the
passover
the
feast
of
pentecost
and
the
feast
of
tabernacles
every
male
throughout
the
land
was
to
appear
before
the
lord
at
jerusalem
with
a
gift
here
the
bond
and
the
free
stood
on
common
ground
deut
xvi
if
a
man
smite
his
servant
or
his
maid
with
a
rod
and
he
die
under
his
hand
he
shall
be
surely
punished
notwithstanding
if
he
continue
a
day
or
two
he
shall
not
be
punished
for
he
is
his
money
ex
xxi
from
these
laws
we
learn
that
hebrew
men
servants
were
bound
to
serve
their
masters
years
unless
their
attachment
to
their
employers
their
wives
and
children
should
induce
them
to
wish
to
remain
in
servitude
in
which
case
in
order
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
deception
on
the
part
of
the
master
the
servant
was
first
taken
before
the
magistrate
where
he
openly
declared
his
intention
of
continuing
in
his
master
service
probably
a
public
register
was
kept
of
such
he
was
then
conducted
to
the
door
of
the
house
in
warm
climates
doors
are
thrown
open
and
his
ear
was
bored
and
by
submitting
to
this
operation
he
testified
his
willingness
to
serve
him
during
his
life
for
jewish
rabbins
who
must
have
understood
jewish
as
it
is
called
affirm
that
servants
were
set
free
at
the
death
of
their
masters
and
did
descend
to
their
heirs
or
that
he
was
to
serve
him
until
the
year
of
jubilee
when
servants
were
set
at
liberty
to
protect
servants
from
violence
it
was
ordained
that
if
a
master
struck
out
the
tooth
or
destroyed
the
eye
of
a
servant
that
servant
immediately
became
for
such
an
act
of
violence
evidently
showed
he
was
unfit
to
possess
the
power
of
a
master
and
therefore
that
power
was
taken
from
him
all
servants
enjoyed
the
rest
of
the
sabbath
and
partook
of
the
privileges
and
festivities
of
the
three
great
jewish
feasts
and
if
a
servant
died
under
the
infliction
of
chastisement
his
master
was
surely
to
be
punished
as
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
and
life
for
life
was
the
jewish
law
of
course
he
was
punished
with
death
i
know
that
great
stress
has
been
laid
upon
the
following
verse
notwithstanding
if
he
continue
a
day
or
two
he
shall
not
be
punished
for
he
is
his
money
slaveholders
and
the
apologists
of
slavery
have
eagerly
seized
upon
this
little
passage
of
scripture
and
held
it
up
as
the
masters
magna
charta
by
which
they
were
licensed
by
god
himself
to
commit
the
greatest
outrages
upon
the
defenceless
victims
of
their
oppression
but
my
friends
was
it
designed
to
be
so
if
our
heavenly
father
would
protect
by
law
the
eye
and
the
tooth
of
a
hebrew
servant
can
we
for
a
moment
believe
that
he
would
abandon
that
same
servant
to
the
brutal
rage
of
a
master
who
would
destroy
even
life
itself
do
we
not
rather
see
in
this
the
law
which
protected
masters
and
was
it
not
right
that
in
case
of
the
death
of
a
servant
one
or
two
days
after
chastisement
was
inflicted
to
which
other
circumstances
might
have
contributed
that
the
master
should
be
protected
when
in
all
probability
he
never
intended
to
produce
so
fatal
a
result
but
the
phrase
he
is
his
money
has
been
adduced
to
show
that
hebrew
servants
were
regarded
as
mere
chattels
personal
if
so
why
were
so
many
laws
made
to
their
rights
as
and
to
ensure
their
rising
into
equality
and
freedom
if
they
were
mere
why
were
they
regarded
as
responsible
beings
and
one
law
made
for
them
as
well
as
for
their
masters
but
i
pass
on
now
to
the
consideration
of
how
the
jewish
servants
were
protected
by
if
she
please
not
her
master
who
hath
betrothed
her
to
himself
then
shall
he
let
her
be
redeemed
to
sell
her
unto
another
nation
he
shall
have
no
power
seeing
he
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
her
if
he
have
betrothed
her
unto
his
son
he
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
manner
of
daughters
if
he
take
him
another
wife
her
food
her
raiment
and
her
duty
of
marriage
shall
he
not
diminish
if
he
do
not
these
three
unto
her
then
shall
she
go
out
without
money
on
these
laws
i
will
give
you
calmet
remarks
a
father
could
not
sell
his
daughter
as
a
slave
according
to
the
rabbins
until
she
was
at
the
age
of
puberty
and
unless
he
were
reduced
to
the
utmost
indigence
besides
when
a
master
bought
an
israelitish
girl
it
was
with
the
presumption
that
he
would
take
her
to
wife
hence
moses
adds
she
please
not
her
master
and
he
does
not
think
fit
to
marry
her
he
shall
set
her
at
liberty
or
according
to
the
hebrew
shall
let
her
be
redeemed
sell
her
to
another
nation
he
shall
have
no
power
seeing
he
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
her
as
to
the
engagement
implied
at
least
of
taking
her
to
wife
he
have
betrothed
her
unto
his
son
he
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
manner
of
daughters
he
shall
take
care
that
his
son
uses
her
as
his
wife
that
he
does
not
despise
or
maltreat
her
if
he
make
his
son
marry
another
wife
he
shall
give
her
her
dowry
her
clothes
and
compensation
for
her
virginity
if
he
does
none
of
these
three
she
shall
out
without
money
thus
were
the
of
female
servants
carefully
secured
by
under
the
jewish
dispensation
and
now
i
would
ask
are
the
rights
of
female
slaves
at
the
south
thus
secured
are
sold
only
as
wives
and
and
when
not
treated
as
such
are
they
allowed
to
out
free
no
they
have
not
only
been
illegally
obtained
as
servants
according
to
hebrew
law
but
they
are
also
illegally
in
bondage
masters
at
the
south
and
west
have
all
forfeited
their
claims
they
ever
had
to
their
female
slaves
we
come
now
to
examine
the
case
of
those
servants
who
were
of
the
heathen
round
about
were
left
entirely
unprotected
by
law
horne
in
speaking
of
the
law
thou
shalt
not
rule
over
him
with
rigor
but
shall
fear
thy
god
remarks
this
law
lev
xxv
it
is
true
speaks
expressly
of
slaves
who
were
of
hebrew
descent
but
as
slaves
were
ingrafted
into
the
hebrew
church
by
circumcision
is
no
but
that
it
applied
to
slaves
if
so
then
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
the
other
protective
laws
extended
to
them
also
and
that
the
only
difference
between
hebrew
and
heathen
servants
lay
in
this
that
the
former
served
but
six
years
unless
they
chose
to
remain
longer
and
were
always
freed
at
the
death
of
their
masters
whereas
the
latter
served
until
the
year
of
jubilee
though
that
might
include
a
period
of
years
and
were
left
from
father
to
son
there
are
however
two
other
laws
which
i
have
not
yet
noticed
the
one
effectually
prevented
servitude
and
the
other
completely
abolished
jewish
servitude
every
fifty
years
they
were
equally
operative
upon
the
heathen
and
the
hebrew
thou
shall
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
that
is
escaped
from
his
master
unto
thee
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
even
among
you
in
that
place
which
he
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
liketh
him
best
thou
shall
oppress
him
deut
xxiii
and
ye
shall
hallow
the
fiftieth
year
and
proclaim
throughout
the
land
unto
the
inhabitants
thereof
it
shall
be
a
jubilee
unto
you
lev
xxv
here
then
we
see
that
by
this
first
law
the
of
freedom
was
opened
wide
to
every
servant
had
any
cause
whatever
for
complaint
if
he
was
unhappy
with
his
master
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
leave
him
and
had
a
right
to
deliver
him
back
to
him
again
and
not
only
so
but
the
absconded
servant
was
to
where
he
should
live
and
no
jew
was
permitted
to
oppress
him
he
left
his
master
just
as
our
northern
servants
leave
us
we
have
no
power
to
compel
them
to
remain
with
us
and
no
man
has
any
right
to
oppress
them
they
go
and
dwell
in
that
place
where
it
chooseth
them
and
live
just
where
they
like
is
it
so
at
the
south
is
the
poor
runaway
slave
protected
from
the
violence
of
that
master
whose
oppression
and
cruelty
has
driven
him
from
his
plantation
or
his
house
no
no
even
the
free
states
of
the
north
are
compelled
to
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
that
is
escaped
from
his
master
into
them
by
law
under
the
in
the
century
are
commanded
to
do
what
more
than
years
ago
under
the
dispensation
positively
the
jews
to
do
in
the
wide
domain
even
of
our
free
states
there
is
not
city
of
refuge
for
the
poor
runaway
fugitive
not
one
spot
upon
which
he
can
stand
and
say
i
am
a
free
man
i
am
protected
in
my
rights
as
a
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
no
how
long
the
north
will
thus
shake
hands
with
the
south
in
sin
i
know
not
how
long
she
will
stand
by
like
the
persecutor
saul
unto
the
death
of
stephen
and
keeping
the
raiment
of
them
that
slew
him
i
know
not
but
one
thing
i
do
know
the
of
the
is
increasing
in
a
tremendous
ratio
as
light
is
pouring
in
upon
her
on
the
subject
and
the
sin
of
slavery
as
the
sun
of
righteousness
climbs
higher
and
higher
in
the
moral
heavens
she
will
stand
still
more
and
more
abashed
as
the
query
is
thundered
down
into
her
ear
hath
required
at
thy
hand
it
will
be
found
excuse
then
that
the
constitution
of
our
country
required
that
bound
to
escaping
from
their
masters
should
be
delivered
up
no
more
excuse
than
was
the
reason
which
adam
assigned
for
eating
the
forbidden
fruit
was
and
punished
he
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
rather
than
to
the
command
of
his
maker
and
will
assuredly
be
condemned
and
punished
for
obeying
rather
than
if
we
do
not
speedily
repent
and
bring
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
yea
are
we
not
receiving
chastisement
even
but
by
the
second
of
these
laws
a
still
more
astonishing
fact
is
disclosed
if
the
first
effectually
prevented
involuntary
the
last
absolutely
forbade
even
servitude
being
on
the
great
day
of
atonement
every
fiftieth
year
the
jubilee
trumpet
was
sounded
throughout
the
land
of
judea
and
was
proclaimed
to
the
inhabitants
thereof
i
will
not
say
that
the
servants
fell
off
and
their
were
burst
for
there
is
no
evidence
that
jewish
servants
felt
the
weight
of
iron
chains
and
collars
and
handcuffs
but
i
do
say
that
even
the
man
who
had
voluntarily
sold
himself
and
the
who
had
been
sold
to
a
hebrew
master
were
set
free
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
this
law
was
evidently
designed
to
prevent
the
oppression
of
the
poor
and
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
as
existing
among
them
where
then
i
would
ask
is
the
warrant
the
justification
or
the
palliation
of
american
slavery
from
hebrew
servitude
how
many
of
the
southern
slaves
would
now
be
in
bondage
according
to
the
laws
of
moses
not
one
you
may
observe
that
i
have
carefully
avoided
using
the
term
when
speaking
of
jewish
servitude
and
simply
for
this
reason
that
such
existed
among
that
people
the
word
translated
servant
does
mean
it
is
the
same
that
is
applied
to
abraham
to
moses
to
elisha
and
the
prophets
generally
slavery
then
never
existed
under
the
jewish
dispensation
at
all
and
i
can
not
but
regard
it
as
an
aspersion
on
the
character
of
him
who
is
glorious
in
holiness
for
any
one
to
assert
that
sanctioned
yea
commanded
under
the
old
dispensation
i
would
fain
lift
my
feeble
voice
to
vindicate
jehovah
character
from
so
foul
a
slander
if
slaveholders
are
determined
to
hold
slaves
as
long
as
they
can
let
them
not
dare
to
say
that
the
god
of
mercy
and
of
truth
sanctioned
such
a
system
of
cruelty
and
wrong
it
is
blasphemy
against
him
we
have
seen
that
the
code
of
laws
framed
by
moses
with
regard
to
servants
was
designed
to
protect
them
as
men
and
women
to
secure
to
them
their
rights
as
human
beings
to
guard
them
from
oppression
and
defend
them
from
violence
of
every
kind
let
us
now
turn
to
the
slave
laws
of
the
south
and
west
and
examine
them
too
i
will
give
you
the
substance
only
because
i
fear
i
shall
tresspass
too
much
on
your
time
were
i
to
quote
them
at
length
is
hereditary
and
perpetual
to
the
last
moment
of
the
slave
earthly
existence
and
to
all
his
descendants
to
the
latest
posterity
the
labor
of
the
slave
is
compulsory
and
uncompensated
while
the
kind
of
labor
the
amount
of
toil
the
time
allowed
for
rest
are
dictated
solely
by
the
master
no
bargain
is
made
no
wages
given
a
pure
despotism
governs
the
human
brute
and
even
his
covering
and
provender
both
as
to
quantity
and
quality
depend
entirely
on
the
master
discretion
the
slave
being
considered
a
personal
chattel
may
be
sold
or
pledged
or
leased
at
the
will
of
his
master
he
may
be
exchanged
for
marketable
commodities
or
taken
in
execution
for
the
debts
or
taxes
either
of
a
living
or
dead
master
sold
at
auction
either
individually
or
in
lots
to
suit
the
purchaser
he
may
remain
with
his
family
or
be
separated
from
them
for
ever
slaves
can
make
no
contracts
and
have
no
right
to
any
property
real
or
personal
their
own
honest
earnings
and
the
legacies
of
friends
belong
in
point
of
law
to
their
masters
neither
a
slave
nor
a
free
colored
person
can
be
a
witness
against
any
or
free
person
in
a
court
of
justice
however
atrocious
may
have
been
the
crimes
they
have
seen
him
commit
if
such
testimony
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
a
but
they
may
give
testimony
a
fellow
or
free
colored
man
even
in
cases
affecting
life
if
the
is
to
reap
the
advantage
of
it
the
slave
may
be
punished
at
his
master
discretion
without
trial
without
any
means
of
legal
redress
whether
his
offence
be
real
or
imaginary
and
the
master
can
transfer
the
same
despotic
power
to
any
person
or
persons
he
may
choose
to
appoint
the
slave
is
not
allowed
to
resist
any
free
man
under
circumstances
only
safety
consists
in
the
fact
that
his
may
bring
suit
and
recover
the
price
of
his
body
in
case
his
life
is
taken
or
his
limbs
rendered
unfit
for
labor
slaves
can
not
redeem
themselves
or
obtain
a
change
of
masters
though
cruel
treatment
may
have
rendered
such
a
change
necessary
for
their
personal
safety
the
slave
is
entirely
unprotected
in
his
domestic
relations
the
laws
greatly
obstruct
the
manumission
of
slaves
even
where
the
master
is
willing
to
enfranchise
them
the
operation
of
the
laws
tends
to
deprive
slaves
of
religious
instruction
and
consolation
the
whole
power
of
the
laws
is
exerted
to
keep
slaves
in
a
state
of
the
lowest
ignorance
there
is
in
this
country
a
monstrous
inequality
of
law
and
right
what
is
a
trifling
fault
in
the
white
man
is
considered
highly
criminal
in
the
slave
the
same
offences
which
cost
a
white
man
a
few
dollars
only
are
punished
in
the
negro
with
death
the
laws
operate
most
oppressively
upon
free
people
of
color
shall
i
ask
you
now
my
friends
to
draw
the
parallel
between
jewish
and
american
no
for
there
is
in
the
two
systems
i
ask
you
rather
to
mark
the
contrast
the
laws
of
moses
in
their
as
men
and
guarded
them
from
oppression
and
defended
them
from
wrong
the
code
noir
of
the
south
the
slave
of
all
his
as
a
reduces
him
to
a
chattel
personal
and
defends
the
master
in
the
exercise
of
the
most
unnatural
and
unwarrantable
power
over
his
slave
they
each
bear
the
impress
of
the
hand
which
formed
them
the
attributes
of
justice
and
mercy
are
shadowed
out
in
the
hebrew
code
those
of
injustice
and
cruelty
in
the
code
noir
of
america
truly
it
was
wise
in
the
slaveholders
of
the
south
to
declare
their
slaves
to
be
chattels
personal
for
before
they
could
be
robbed
of
wages
wives
children
and
friends
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
deny
they
were
human
beings
it
is
wise
in
them
to
keep
them
in
abject
ignorance
for
the
strong
man
armed
must
be
bound
before
we
can
spoil
his
house
the
powerful
intellect
of
man
must
be
bound
down
with
the
iron
chains
of
nescience
before
we
can
rob
him
of
his
rights
as
a
man
we
must
reduce
him
to
a
before
we
can
claim
the
right
to
set
our
feet
upon
his
neck
because
it
was
only
which
were
originally
under
the
feet
of
by
the
almighty
and
beneficent
father
of
all
who
has
declared
himself
to
be
of
persons
whether
red
white
or
black
but
some
have
even
said
that
jesus
christ
did
not
condemn
slavery
to
this
i
reply
that
our
holy
redeemer
lived
and
preached
among
the
jews
only
the
laws
which
moses
had
enacted
fifteen
hundred
years
previous
to
his
appearance
among
them
had
never
been
annulled
and
these
laws
protected
every
servant
in
palestine
if
then
he
did
not
condemn
jewish
servitude
this
does
not
prove
that
he
would
not
have
condemned
such
a
monstrous
system
as
that
of
american
if
that
had
existed
among
them
but
did
not
jesus
condemn
slavery
let
us
examine
some
of
his
precepts
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
even
so
to
let
every
slaveholder
apply
these
queries
to
his
own
heart
am
willing
to
be
a
slave
am
willing
to
see
wife
the
slave
of
another
am
willing
to
see
my
mother
a
slave
or
my
father
my
sister
or
my
brother
if
then
in
holding
others
as
slaves
i
am
doing
what
i
would
wish
to
be
done
to
me
or
any
relative
i
have
and
thus
have
i
broken
this
golden
rule
which
was
given
to
walk
by
but
some
slaveholders
have
said
we
were
never
in
bondage
to
any
man
and
therefore
the
yoke
of
bondage
would
be
insufferable
to
us
but
slaves
are
accustomed
to
it
their
backs
are
fitted
to
the
burden
well
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
you
who
have
lived
in
freedom
would
find
slavery
even
more
oppressive
than
the
poor
slave
does
but
then
you
may
try
this
question
in
another
form
am
i
willing
to
reduce
little
to
slavery
you
know
that
it
is
brought
up
a
it
will
never
know
any
contrast
between
freedom
and
bondage
its
back
will
become
fitted
to
the
burden
just
as
the
negro
child
does
by
but
by
daily
violent
pressure
in
the
same
way
that
the
head
of
the
indian
child
becomes
flattened
by
the
boards
in
which
it
is
bound
it
has
been
justly
remarked
that
never
made
a
he
made
man
upright
his
back
was
made
to
carry
burdens
nor
his
neck
to
wear
a
yoke
and
the
must
be
crushed
within
him
before
back
can
be
to
the
burden
of
perpetual
slavery
and
that
his
back
is
fitted
to
it
is
manifest
by
the
insurrections
that
so
often
disturb
the
peace
and
security
of
slaveholding
countries
who
ever
heard
of
a
rebellion
of
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
why
not
simply
because
were
all
placed
the
feet
of
into
whose
hand
they
were
delivered
it
was
originally
designed
that
they
should
serve
him
therefore
their
necks
have
been
formed
for
the
yoke
and
their
backs
for
the
burden
but
so
with
intellectual
immortal
man
i
appeal
to
you
my
friends
as
mothers
are
you
willing
to
enslave
children
you
start
back
with
horror
and
indignation
at
such
a
question
but
why
if
slavery
is
to
those
upon
whom
it
is
imposed
why
if
as
has
often
been
said
slaves
are
happier
than
their
masters
free
from
the
cares
and
perplexities
of
providing
for
themselves
and
their
families
why
not
place
in
the
way
of
being
supported
without
your
having
the
trouble
to
provide
for
them
or
they
for
themselves
do
you
not
perceive
that
as
soon
as
this
golden
rule
of
action
is
applied
to
that
you
involuntarily
shrink
from
the
test
as
soon
as
actions
are
weighed
in
balance
of
the
sanctuary
that
are
found
try
yourselves
by
another
of
the
divine
precepts
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
can
we
love
a
man
we
love
if
we
do
and
continue
to
do
unto
him
what
we
would
not
wish
any
one
to
do
to
us
look
too
at
christ
example
what
does
he
say
of
himself
i
came
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
can
you
for
a
moment
imagine
the
meek
and
lowly
and
compassionate
saviour
a
do
you
not
shudder
at
this
thought
as
much
as
at
that
of
his
being
but
why
if
slavery
is
not
sinful
again
it
has
been
said
the
apostle
paul
did
not
condemn
slavery
for
he
sent
onesimus
back
to
philemon
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
said
he
sent
him
back
for
no
coercion
was
made
use
of
onesimus
was
not
thrown
into
prison
and
then
sent
back
in
chains
to
his
master
as
your
runaway
slaves
often
are
this
could
not
possibly
have
been
the
case
because
you
know
paul
as
a
jew
was
to
the
runaway
had
no
to
send
any
fugitive
back
to
his
master
the
state
of
the
case
then
seems
to
have
been
this
onesimus
had
been
an
unprofitable
servant
to
philemon
and
left
him
he
afterwards
became
converted
under
the
apostle
preaching
and
seeing
that
he
had
been
to
blame
in
his
conduct
and
desiring
by
future
fidelity
to
atone
for
past
error
he
wished
to
return
and
the
apostle
gave
him
the
letter
we
now
have
as
a
recommendation
to
philemon
informing
him
of
the
conversion
of
onesimus
and
entreating
him
as
paul
the
aged
to
receive
him
now
as
a
servant
but
a
servant
a
brother
beloved
especially
to
me
but
how
much
more
unto
thee
both
in
the
flesh
and
in
the
lord
if
thou
count
therefore
as
a
partner
him
as
this
then
surely
can
not
be
forced
into
a
justification
of
the
practice
of
returning
runaway
slaves
back
to
their
masters
to
be
punished
with
cruel
beatings
and
scourgings
as
they
often
are
besides
the
word
greek
doulos
here
translated
servant
is
the
same
that
is
made
use
of
in
matt
xviii
now
it
appears
that
this
servant
owed
his
lord
ten
thousand
talents
he
possessed
property
to
a
vast
amount
onesimus
could
not
then
have
been
a
for
slaves
do
not
own
their
wives
or
children
no
not
even
their
own
bodies
much
less
property
but
again
the
servitude
which
the
apostle
was
accustomed
to
must
have
been
very
different
from
american
slavery
for
he
says
the
heir
or
son
as
long
as
he
is
a
child
differeth
from
a
though
he
be
lord
of
all
but
is
under
and
governors
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
father
from
this
it
appears
that
the
means
of
were
provided
for
as
well
as
children
and
indeed
we
know
it
must
have
been
so
among
the
jews
because
their
servants
were
not
permitted
to
remain
in
perpetual
bondage
and
therefore
it
was
absolutely
necessary
they
should
be
prepared
to
occupy
higher
stations
in
society
than
those
of
servants
is
it
so
at
the
south
my
friends
is
the
daily
bread
of
instruction
provided
for
slaves
are
their
minds
enlightened
and
they
gradually
prepared
to
rise
from
the
grade
of
menials
into
that
of
independent
members
of
the
state
let
your
own
statute
book
and
your
own
daily
experience
answer
these
questions
if
this
apostle
sanctioned
why
did
he
exhort
in
his
epistle
to
the
ephesians
and
ye
masters
do
the
same
things
unto
them
perform
your
duties
to
your
servants
as
unto
christ
not
unto
me
knowing
that
your
master
also
is
in
heaven
neither
is
respect
of
persons
with
and
in
colossians
masters
give
unto
your
servants
that
which
is
and
knowing
that
ye
also
have
a
master
in
heaven
let
slaveholders
only
obey
these
injunctions
of
paul
and
i
am
satisfied
slavery
would
soon
be
abolished
if
he
thought
it
sinful
even
to
servants
surely
he
must
have
thought
it
sinful
to
flog
and
to
beat
them
with
sticks
and
paddles
indeed
when
delineating
the
character
of
a
bishop
he
expressly
names
this
as
one
feature
of
it
let
masters
give
unto
their
servants
that
which
is
and
and
all
that
vast
system
of
unrequited
labor
would
crumble
into
ruin
yes
and
if
they
once
felt
they
had
no
right
to
the
of
their
servants
without
pay
surely
they
could
not
think
they
had
a
right
to
their
wives
their
children
and
their
own
bodies
again
how
can
it
be
said
paul
sanctioned
slavery
when
as
though
to
put
this
matter
beyond
all
doubt
in
that
black
catalogue
of
sins
enumerated
in
his
first
epistle
to
timothy
he
mentions
which
word
may
be
translated
but
you
may
say
we
all
despise
slavedealers
as
much
as
any
one
can
they
are
never
admitted
into
genteel
or
respectable
society
and
why
not
is
it
not
because
even
you
shrink
back
from
the
idea
of
associating
with
those
who
make
their
fortunes
by
trading
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
women
and
children
whose
daily
work
it
is
to
break
human
hearts
by
tearing
wives
from
their
husbands
and
children
from
their
parents
but
why
hold
slavedealers
as
despicable
if
their
trade
is
lawful
and
virtuous
and
why
despise
them
more
than
the
of
fortune
and
who
employ
them
as
agents
why
more
than
the
of
who
barter
their
to
them
for
gold
and
silver
we
do
not
despise
the
land
agent
or
the
physician
or
the
merchant
and
why
simply
because
their
professions
are
virtuous
and
honorable
and
if
the
trade
of
was
honorable
you
would
not
despise
them
either
there
is
no
difference
in
in
between
the
despised
slavedealer
and
the
who
buys
slaves
from
or
sells
slaves
to
him
indeed
if
slaves
were
not
wanted
by
the
respectable
the
wealthy
and
the
religious
in
a
community
there
would
be
no
slaves
in
that
community
and
of
course
no
it
is
then
the
and
the
and
of
the
south
who
are
the
of
this
grand
temple
built
to
mammon
and
to
moloch
it
is
the
in
every
country
who
are
to
blame
when
any
public
sin
is
supported
by
public
opinion
hence
isaiah
says
the
lord
hath
performed
his
whole
work
upon
mount
and
on
then
i
will
punish
the
fruit
of
the
stout
heart
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
the
glory
of
his
high
looks
and
was
it
not
so
open
the
historical
records
of
that
age
was
not
israel
carried
into
captivity
judah
and
the
stout
heart
of
the
heathen
monarchy
not
punished
until
years
judah
and
seventy
years
israel
captivity
when
it
was
overthrown
by
cyrus
king
of
persia
hence
too
the
apostle
peter
says
judgment
must
at
the
house
of
surely
this
would
not
be
the
case
if
the
of
were
not
of
blame
but
it
may
be
asked
why
are
most
culpable
i
will
tell
you
my
friends
it
is
because
sin
is
imputed
to
us
just
in
proportion
to
the
spiritual
light
we
receive
thus
the
prophet
amos
says
in
the
name
of
jehovah
you
have
i
known
of
all
the
families
of
the
earth
i
will
punish
for
all
your
iniquities
hear
too
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
on
this
important
subject
the
servant
who
his
lord
will
and
himself
neither
did
according
to
his
will
shall
be
beaten
with
stripes
and
why
for
unto
whomsoever
is
given
shall
be
required
and
to
whom
men
have
committed
of
they
will
ask
the
oh
then
that
the
of
the
south
would
ponder
these
things
in
their
hearts
and
awake
to
the
vast
responsibilities
which
rest
at
this
important
crisis
i
have
thus
i
think
clearly
proved
to
you
seven
propositions
viz
first
that
slavery
is
contrary
to
the
declaration
of
our
independence
second
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
first
charter
of
human
rights
given
to
adam
and
renewed
to
noah
third
that
the
fact
of
slavery
having
been
the
subject
of
prophecy
furnishes
excuse
whatever
to
slavedealers
fourth
that
no
such
system
existed
under
the
patriarchal
dispensation
fifth
that
existed
under
the
jewish
dispensation
but
so
far
otherwise
that
every
servant
was
placed
under
the
of
and
care
taken
not
only
to
prevent
all
servitude
but
all
bondage
sixth
that
slavery
in
america
reduces
a
to
a
a
chattel
personal
of
his
rights
as
a
fetters
both
his
mind
and
body
and
protects
the
in
the
most
unnatural
and
unreasonable
power
whilst
it
him
of
the
protection
of
law
seventh
that
slavery
is
contrary
to
the
example
and
precepts
of
our
holy
and
merciful
redeemer
and
of
his
apostles
but
perhaps
you
will
be
ready
to
query
why
appeal
to
on
this
subject
do
not
make
the
laws
which
perpetuate
slavery
legislative
power
is
vested
in
can
do
nothing
to
overthrow
the
system
even
if
we
wished
to
do
so
to
this
i
reply
i
know
you
do
not
make
the
laws
but
i
also
know
that
are
the
wives
and
mothers
the
sisters
and
daughters
of
those
who
do
and
if
you
really
suppose
can
do
nothing
to
overthrow
slavery
you
are
greatly
mistaken
you
can
do
much
in
every
way
four
things
i
will
name
you
can
read
on
this
subject
you
can
pray
over
this
subject
you
can
speak
on
this
subject
you
can
on
this
subject
i
have
not
placed
reading
before
praying
because
i
regard
it
more
important
but
because
in
order
to
pray
aright
we
must
understand
what
we
are
praying
for
it
is
only
then
we
can
pray
with
the
understanding
and
the
spirit
also
read
then
on
the
subject
of
slavery
search
the
scriptures
daily
whether
the
things
i
have
told
you
are
true
other
books
and
papers
might
be
a
great
help
to
you
in
this
investigation
but
they
are
not
necessary
and
it
is
hardly
probable
that
your
committees
of
vigilance
will
allow
you
to
have
any
other
the
then
is
the
book
i
want
you
to
read
in
the
spirit
of
inquiry
and
the
spirit
of
prayer
even
the
enemies
of
abolitionists
acknowledge
that
their
doctrines
are
drawn
from
it
in
the
great
mob
in
boston
last
autumn
when
the
books
and
papers
of
the
society
were
thrown
out
of
the
windows
of
their
office
one
individual
laid
hold
of
the
bible
and
was
about
tossing
it
out
to
the
ground
when
another
reminded
him
that
it
was
the
bible
he
had
in
his
hand
is
all
he
replied
and
out
went
the
sacred
volume
along
with
the
rest
we
thank
him
for
the
acknowledgment
yes
is
all
for
our
books
and
papers
are
mostly
commentaries
on
the
bible
and
the
declaration
read
the
then
it
contains
the
words
of
jesus
and
they
are
spirit
and
life
judge
for
yourselves
whether
such
a
system
of
oppression
and
crime
pray
over
this
subject
when
you
have
entered
into
your
closets
and
shut
to
the
doors
then
pray
to
your
father
who
seeth
in
secret
that
he
would
open
your
eyes
to
see
whether
slavery
is
and
if
it
is
that
he
would
enable
you
to
bear
a
faithful
open
and
unshrinking
testimony
against
it
and
to
do
whatsoever
your
hands
find
to
do
leaving
the
consequences
entirely
to
him
who
still
says
to
us
whenever
we
try
to
reason
away
duty
from
the
fear
of
consequences
is
that
to
thee
follow
thou
pray
also
for
that
poor
slave
that
he
may
be
kept
patient
and
submissive
under
his
hard
lot
until
god
is
pleased
to
open
the
door
of
freedom
to
him
without
violence
or
bloodshed
pray
too
for
the
master
that
his
heart
may
be
softened
and
he
made
willing
to
acknowledge
as
joseph
brethren
did
verily
we
are
guilty
concerning
our
brother
before
he
will
be
compelled
to
add
in
consequence
of
divine
judgment
therefore
is
all
this
evil
come
upon
us
pray
also
for
all
your
brethren
and
sisters
who
are
laboring
in
the
righteous
cause
of
emancipation
in
the
northern
states
england
and
the
world
there
is
great
encouragement
for
prayer
in
these
words
of
our
lord
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
the
father
my
he
it
to
you
pray
then
without
ceasing
in
the
closet
and
the
social
circle
speak
on
this
subject
it
is
through
the
tongue
the
pen
and
the
press
that
truth
is
principally
propagated
speak
then
to
your
relatives
your
friends
your
acquaintances
on
the
subject
of
slavery
be
not
afraid
if
you
are
conscientiously
convinced
it
is
to
say
so
openly
but
calmly
and
to
let
your
sentiments
be
known
if
you
are
served
by
the
slaves
of
others
try
to
ameliorate
their
condition
as
much
as
possible
never
aggravate
their
faults
and
thus
add
fuel
to
the
fire
of
anger
already
kindled
in
a
master
and
bosom
remember
their
extreme
ignorance
and
consider
them
as
your
heavenly
father
does
the
culpable
on
this
account
even
when
they
do
wrong
things
discountenance
all
cruelty
to
them
all
starvation
all
corporal
chastisement
these
may
brutalize
and
their
spirits
but
will
never
bend
them
to
willing
cheerful
obedience
if
possible
see
that
they
are
comfortably
and
fed
whether
in
the
house
or
the
field
it
is
unreasonable
and
cruel
to
expect
slaves
to
wait
for
their
breakfast
until
eleven
when
they
rise
at
five
or
six
do
all
you
can
to
induce
their
owners
to
clothe
them
well
and
to
allow
them
many
little
indulgences
which
would
contribute
to
their
comfort
above
all
try
to
persuade
your
husband
father
brothers
and
sons
that
is
a
crime
against
god
and
and
that
it
is
a
great
sin
to
keep
in
such
abject
ignorance
to
deny
them
the
privilege
of
learning
to
read
and
write
the
catholics
are
universally
condemned
for
denying
the
bible
to
the
common
people
but
must
blame
them
for
are
doing
the
same
and
for
the
very
same
reason
neither
of
these
systems
can
bear
the
light
which
bursts
from
the
pages
of
that
holy
book
and
lastly
endeavour
to
inculcate
submission
on
the
part
of
the
slaves
but
whilst
doing
this
be
faithful
in
pleading
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
will
behold
unheeding
life
holiest
feelings
crushed
where
heart
is
bleeding
shall
voice
be
hushed
act
on
this
subject
some
of
you
own
slaves
yourselves
if
you
believe
slavery
is
set
them
at
liberty
undo
the
heavy
burdens
and
let
the
oppressed
go
free
if
they
wish
to
remain
with
you
pay
them
wages
if
not
let
them
leave
you
should
they
remain
teach
them
and
have
them
taught
the
common
branches
of
an
english
education
they
have
minds
and
those
minds
to
be
so
precious
a
talent
as
intellect
never
was
given
to
be
wrapt
in
a
napkin
and
buried
in
the
earth
it
is
the
of
all
as
far
as
they
can
to
improve
their
own
mental
faculties
because
we
are
commanded
to
love
god
with
our
as
well
as
with
all
our
hearts
and
we
commit
a
great
sin
if
we
or
that
cultivation
of
the
mind
in
others
which
would
enable
them
to
perform
this
duty
teach
your
servants
then
to
read
c
and
encourage
them
to
believe
it
is
their
to
learn
if
it
were
only
that
they
might
read
the
bible
but
some
of
you
will
say
we
can
neither
free
our
slaves
nor
teach
them
to
read
for
the
laws
of
our
state
forbid
it
be
not
surprised
when
i
say
such
wicked
laws
to
be
no
in
the
way
of
your
duty
and
i
appeal
to
the
bible
to
prove
this
position
what
was
the
conduct
of
shiphrah
and
puah
when
the
king
of
egypt
issued
his
cruel
mandate
with
regard
to
the
hebrew
children
feared
and
did
as
the
king
of
egypt
commanded
them
but
saved
the
men
children
alive
did
these
do
right
in
disobeying
that
monarch
says
the
sacred
text
dealt
with
them
and
made
them
houses
ex
i
what
was
the
conduct
of
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
when
nebuchadnezzar
set
up
a
golden
image
in
the
plain
of
dura
and
commanded
all
people
nations
and
languages
to
fall
down
and
worship
it
be
it
known
unto
thee
said
these
faithful
o
king
that
we
serve
thy
gods
nor
worship
the
image
which
thou
hast
set
up
did
these
men
right
in
disobeying
the
of
their
sovereign
let
their
miraculous
deliverance
of
daniel
when
darius
made
a
firm
decree
that
no
one
should
ask
a
petition
of
any
mad
or
god
for
thirty
days
did
the
prophet
cease
to
pray
no
when
daniel
that
the
writing
was
he
went
into
his
house
and
his
windows
being
towards
jerusalem
he
kneeled
upon
this
knees
three
times
a
day
and
prayed
and
gave
thanks
before
his
god
as
he
did
aforetime
did
daniel
do
right
this
to
the
law
of
his
king
let
his
wonderful
deliverance
out
of
the
mouthes
of
lions
answer
dan
vii
look
too
at
the
apostles
peter
and
john
when
the
ruler
of
the
jews
them
to
speak
at
all
nor
teach
in
the
name
of
jesus
what
did
they
say
whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
god
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
god
judge
ye
and
what
did
they
do
they
spake
the
word
of
god
with
boldness
and
with
great
power
gave
the
apostles
witness
of
the
of
the
lord
jesus
although
was
the
very
doctrine
for
the
preaching
of
which
they
had
just
been
cast
into
prison
and
further
threatened
did
these
men
do
right
i
leave
to
answer
who
now
enjoy
the
benefits
if
their
labours
and
sufferings
in
that
gospel
they
dared
to
preach
when
positively
commanded
to
teach
any
in
the
name
of
jesus
acts
iv
but
some
of
you
may
say
if
we
do
free
our
slaves
they
will
be
taken
up
and
sold
therefore
there
will
be
no
use
in
doing
it
peter
and
john
might
just
as
well
have
said
we
will
not
preach
the
gospel
for
if
we
do
we
shall
be
taken
up
and
put
in
prison
therefore
there
will
be
no
use
in
our
preaching
my
friends
belong
no
more
to
than
they
did
to
these
apostles
duty
is
ours
and
events
are
god
if
you
think
slavery
is
sinful
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
set
your
slaves
at
liberty
do
all
you
can
to
protect
them
and
in
humble
faith
and
fervent
prayer
commend
them
to
your
common
father
he
can
take
care
of
them
but
if
for
wise
purposes
he
sees
fit
to
allow
them
to
be
sold
this
will
afford
you
an
opportunity
of
testifying
openly
wherever
you
go
against
the
crime
of
such
an
act
will
be
and
if
exposed
might
under
the
divine
direction
do
the
cause
of
emancipation
more
good
than
any
thing
that
could
happen
for
he
makes
even
the
wrath
of
man
to
praise
him
and
the
remainder
of
wrath
he
will
restrain
i
know
that
this
doctrine
of
obeying
rather
than
man
will
be
considered
as
dangerous
and
heretical
by
many
but
i
am
not
afraid
openly
to
avow
it
because
it
is
the
doctrine
of
the
bible
but
i
would
not
be
understood
to
advocate
resistance
to
any
law
however
oppressive
if
in
obeying
it
i
was
not
obliged
to
commit
if
for
instance
there
was
a
law
which
imposed
imprisonment
or
a
fine
upon
me
if
i
manumitted
a
slave
i
would
on
no
account
resist
that
law
i
would
set
the
slave
free
and
then
go
to
prison
or
pay
the
fine
if
a
law
commands
me
to
i
will
break
if
it
calls
me
to
i
will
let
it
take
its
course
unresistingly
the
doctrine
of
blind
obedience
and
unqualified
submission
to
power
whether
civil
or
ecclesiastical
is
the
doctrine
of
despotism
and
ought
to
have
no
place
among
republicans
and
christians
but
you
will
perhaps
say
such
a
course
of
conduct
would
inevitably
expose
us
to
great
suffering
yes
my
christian
friends
i
believe
it
would
but
this
will
excuse
you
or
any
one
else
for
the
neglect
of
if
prophets
and
apostles
martyrs
and
reformers
had
not
been
willing
to
suffer
for
the
truth
sake
where
would
the
world
have
been
now
if
they
had
said
we
can
not
speak
the
truth
we
can
not
do
what
we
believe
is
right
because
the
of
our
country
or
public
opinion
are
against
where
would
our
holy
religion
have
been
now
the
prophets
were
stoned
imprisoned
and
killed
by
the
jews
and
why
because
they
exposed
and
openly
rebuked
public
sins
they
opposed
public
opinion
had
they
held
their
peace
they
all
might
have
lived
in
ease
and
died
in
favor
with
a
wicked
generation
why
were
the
apostles
persecuted
from
city
to
city
stoned
incarcerated
beaten
and
crucified
because
they
dared
to
the
to
tell
the
jews
boldly
and
fearlessly
that
were
the
of
the
lord
of
glory
and
that
however
great
a
the
cross
might
be
to
them
there
was
no
other
name
given
under
heaven
by
which
men
could
be
saved
but
the
name
of
jesus
because
they
declared
even
at
athens
the
seat
of
learning
and
refinement
the
truth
that
they
be
no
gods
that
are
made
with
hands
and
exposed
to
the
grecians
the
foolishness
of
worldly
wisdom
and
the
impossibility
of
salvation
but
through
christ
whom
they
despised
on
account
of
the
ignominious
death
he
died
because
at
rome
the
proud
mistress
of
the
world
they
thundered
out
the
terrors
of
the
law
upon
that
idolatrous
and
slaveholding
community
why
were
the
martyrs
stretched
upon
the
rack
gibbetted
and
burnt
the
scorn
and
diversion
of
a
nero
whilst
their
tarred
and
burning
bodies
sent
up
a
light
which
illuminated
the
roman
capital
why
were
the
waldenses
hunted
like
wild
beasts
upon
the
mountains
of
piedmont
and
slain
with
the
sword
of
the
duke
of
savoy
and
the
proud
monarch
of
france
why
were
the
presbyterians
chased
like
the
partridge
over
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
methodists
pumped
and
stoned
and
pelted
with
rotten
eggs
the
quakers
incarcerated
in
filthy
prisons
beaten
whipped
at
the
cart
tail
banished
and
hung
because
they
dared
to
the
to
the
unrighteous
of
their
country
and
chose
rather
to
suffer
affliction
with
the
people
of
god
not
accepting
deliverance
even
under
the
gallows
why
were
luther
and
calvin
persecuted
and
excommunicated
cranmer
ridley
and
latimer
burnt
because
they
fearlessly
proclaimed
the
truth
though
that
truth
was
contrary
to
public
opinion
and
the
authority
of
ecclesiastical
councils
and
conventions
now
all
this
vast
amount
of
human
suffering
might
have
been
saved
all
these
prophets
and
apostles
martyrs
and
reformers
might
have
lived
and
died
in
peace
with
all
men
but
following
the
example
of
their
great
pattern
they
despised
the
shame
endured
the
cross
and
are
now
set
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
god
having
received
the
glorious
welcome
of
well
done
good
and
faithful
servants
enter
ye
into
the
joy
of
your
lord
but
you
may
say
we
are
women
how
can
our
hearts
endure
persecution
and
why
not
have
not
women
stood
up
in
all
the
dignity
and
strength
of
moral
courage
to
be
the
leaders
of
the
people
and
to
bear
a
faithful
testimony
for
the
truth
whenever
the
providence
of
god
has
called
them
to
do
so
are
there
no
women
in
that
noble
army

the
instrument
appointed
by
god

reverse
the
bloody

save
the

what
human
voice
first
proclaimed
to
mary
that
she
should
be
the
mother
of
our
lord
it
was
a
woman
elizabeth
the

who
united
with
the
good
old
simeon
in
giving
thanks
publicly
in
the
temple
when
the
child
jesus
was
presented
there
by
his
parents
and
spake
of
him
to
all
them
that
looked
for

it
was
a

first
proclaimed
christ
as
the
true
messiah
in
the
streets
of

once
the
capital

ten
tribes
it
was
a
woman
who
ministered
to
the
son
of
god
whilst
on
earth
a
despised
and
persecuted
reformer
in
the
humble
garb
of
a
carpenter
they
were
women
who
followed
the
rejected
king
of
israel
as
his
fainting
footsteps
trod
the
road
to
calvary
a
great
company
of
people
and
of
and
it
is
remarkable
that
to
he
turned
and
addressed
the
pathetic
language
daughters
of
jerusalem
weep
not
for
me
but
weep
for
yourselves
and
your
children
ah
who
sent
unto
the
roman
governor
when
he
was
set
down
on
the
judgment
seat
saying
unto
him
have
thou
nothing
to
do
with
that
just
man
for
i
have
suffered
many
things
this
day
in
a
dream
because
of
him
it
was
a
the
wife
of
pilate
although
that
for
envy
the
jews
had
delivered
christ
yet
consented
to
surrender
the
son
of
god
into
the
hands
of
a
brutal
soldiery
after
having
himself
scourged
his
naked
body
had
the
of
pilate
sat
upon
that
judgment
seat
what
would
have
been
the
result
of
the
trial
of
this
just
person
and
who
last
hung
round
the
cross
of
jesus
on
the
mountain
of
golgotha
who
first
visited
the
sepulchre
early
in
the
morning
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
carrying
sweet
spices
to
embalm
his
precious
body
not
knowing
that
it
was
incorruptible
and
could
not
be
holden
by
the
bands
of
death
these
were
to
whom
did
he
appear
after
his
resurrection
it
was
to
a
mary
magdalene
mark
xvi
who
gathered
with
the
apostles
to
wait
at
jerusalem
in
prayer
and
supplication
for
the
promise
of
the
father
the
spiritual
blessing
of
the
great
high
priest
of
his
church
who
had
entered
into
the
splendid
temple
of
solomon
there
to
offer
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
and
the
smoking
censer
upon
the
golden
altar
but
into
heaven
itself
there
to
present
his
intercessions
after
having
given
himself
for
us
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice
to
god
for
a
sweet
smelling
savor
were
among
that
holy
company
acts
i
and
did
wait
in
vain
did
those
who
had
ministered
to
his
necessities
followed
in
his
train
and
wept
at
his
crucifixion
wait
in
vain
no
no
did
the
cloven
tongues
of
fire
descend
upon
the
heads
of
as
well
as
men
yes
my
friends
it
sat
upon
one
of
them
acts
ii
as
well
as
men
were
to
be
living
stones
in
the
temple
of
grace
and
therefore
heads
were
consecrated
by
the
descent
of
the
holy
ghost
as
well
as
those
of
men
were
recognized
as
fellow
laborers
in
the
gospel
field
they
were
paul
says
in
his
epistle
to
the
philippians
help
those
who
labored
with
me
in
the
gospel
phil
iv
but
this
is
not
all
roman
were
burnt
at
the
stake
delicate
limbs
were
torn
joint
from
joint
by
the
ferocious
beasts
of
the
amphitheatre
and
tossed
by
the
wild
bull
in
his
fury
for
the
diversion
of
that
idolatrous
warlike
and
slaveholding
people
yes
suffered
under
the
ten
persecutions
of
heathen
rome
with
the
most
unshrinking
constancy
and
fortitude
not
all
the
entreaties
of
friends
nor
the
claims
of
new
born
infancy
nor
the
cruel
threats
of
enemies
could
make
sprinkle
one
grain
of
incense
upon
the
altars
of
roman
idols
come
now
with
me
to
the
beautiful
valleys
of
piedmont
whose
blood
stains
the
green
sward
and
decks
the
wild
flowers
with
colors
not
their
own
and
smokes
on
the
sword
of
persecuting
france
it
is
as
well
as
man
yes
were
accounted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter
and
were
cut
down
as
the
tender
saplings
of
the
wood
but
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
all
those
hundreds
and
thousands
of
who
perished
in
the
low
countries
of
holland
when
alva
sword
of
vengeance
was
unsheathed
against
the
protestants
when
the
catholic
inquisitions
of
europe
became
the
merciless
executioners
of
vindictive
wrath
upon
those
who
dared
to
worship
god
instead
of
bowing
down
in
unholy
adoration
before
my
lord
god
the
and
when
england
too
burnt
her
ann
ascoes
at
the
stake
of
martyrdom
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
church
after
having
been
driven
from
judea
to
rome
and
from
rome
to
piedmont
and
from
piedmont
to
england
and
from
england
to
holland
at
last
stretched
her
fainting
wings
over
the
dark
bosom
of
the
atlantic
and
found
on
the
shores
of
a
great
wilderness
a
refuge
from
tyranny
and
oppression
as
she
thought
but
the
warm
blush
of
shame
mantles
my
cheek
as
i
write
it
here
was
beaten
and
banished
imprisoned
and
hung
upon
the
gallows
a
trophy
to
the
cross
and
what
i
would
ask
in
conclusion
have
done
for
the
great
and
glorious
cause
of
emancipation
who
wrote
that
pamphlet
which
moved
the
heart
of
wilberforce
to
pray
over
the
wrongs
and
his
tongue
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
african
it
was
a
elizabeth
heyrick
who
labored
assiduously
to
keep
the
sufferings
of
the
slave
continually
before
the
british
public
they
were
women
and
how
did
they
do
it
by
their
needles
paint
brushes
and
pens
by
speaking
the
truth
and
petitioning
parliament
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
what
was
the
effect
of
their
labors
read
it
in
the
emancipation
bill
of
great
britain
read
it
in
the
present
state
of
her
west
india
colonies
read
it
in
the
impulse
which
has
been
given
to
the
cause
of
freedom
in
the
united
states
of
america
have
english
women
then
done
so
much
for
the
negro
and
shall
american
women
do
nothing
oh
no
already
are
there
sixty
female
societies
in
operation
these
are
doing
just
what
the
english
women
did
telling
the
story
of
the
colored
man
wrongs
praying
for
his
deliverance
and
presenting
his
kneeling
image
constantly
before
the
public
eye
on
bags
and
even
the
children
of
the
north
are
inscribing
on
their
handy
work
may
the
points
of
our
needles
prick
the
slaveholder
conscience
some
of
the
reports
of
these
societies
exhibit
not
only
considerable
talent
but
a
deep
sense
of
religious
duty
and
a
determination
to
persevere
through
evil
as
well
as
good
report
until
every
scourge
and
every
shackle
is
buried
under
the
feet
of
the
manumitted
slave
the
ladies
society
of
boston
was
called
last
fall
to
a
severe
trial
of
their
faith
and
constancy
they
were
mobbed
by
the
gentlemen
of
property
and
standing
in
that
city
at
their
anniversary
meeting
and
their
lives
were
jeoparded
by
an
infuriated
crowd
but
their
conduct
on
that
occasion
did
credit
to
our
sex
and
affords
a
full
assurance
that
they
will
never
abandon
the
cause
of
the
slave
the
pamphlet
right
and
wrong
in
boston
issued
by
them
in
which
a
particular
account
is
given
of
that
mob
of
broad
cloth
in
broad
day
does
equal
credit
to
the
head
and
the
heart
of
her
who
wrote
it
wish
my
southern
sisters
could
read
it
they
would
then
understand
that
the
women
of
the
north
have
engaged
in
this
work
from
a
sense
of
and
that
nothing
will
ever
induce
them
to
take
their
hands
from
it
until
it
is
fully
accomplished
they
feel
no
hostility
to
you
no
bitterness
or
wrath
they
rather
sympathize
in
your
trials
and
difficulties
but
they
well
know
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
to
help
you
is
to
pour
in
the
light
of
truth
on
your
minds
to
urge
you
to
reflect
on
and
pray
over
the
subject
this
is
all
can
do
for
you
must
work
out
your
own
deliverance
with
fear
and
trembling
and
with
the
direction
and
blessing
of
god
can
do
northern
women
may
labor
to
produce
a
correct
public
opinion
at
the
north
but
if
southern
women
sit
down
in
listless
indifference
and
criminal
idleness
public
opinion
can
not
be
rectified
and
purified
at
the
south
it
is
manifest
to
every
reflecting
mind
that
slavery
must
be
abolished
the
era
in
which
we
live
and
the
light
which
is
overspreading
the
whole
world
on
this
subject
clearly
show
that
the
time
can
not
be
distant
when
it
will
be
done
now
there
are
only
two
ways
in
which
it
can
be
effected
by
moral
power
or
physical
force
and
it
is
for
you
to
choose
which
of
these
you
prefer
slavery
always
has
and
always
will
produce
insurrections
wherever
it
exists
because
it
is
a
violation
of
the
natural
order
of
things
and
no
human
power
can
much
longer
perpetuate
it
the
opposers
of
abolitionists
fully
believe
this
one
of
them
remarked
to
me
not
long
since
there
is
no
doubt
there
will
be
a
most
terrible
overturning
at
the
south
in
a
few
years
such
cruelty
and
wrong
must
be
visited
with
divine
vengeance
soon
abolitionists
believe
too
that
this
must
inevitably
be
the
case
if
you
do
not
repent
and
they
are
not
willing
to
leave
you
to
perish
without
entreating
you
to
save
yourselves
from
destruction
well
may
they
say
with
the
apostle
am
i
then
your
enemy
because
i
tell
you
the
truth
and
warn
you
to
flee
from
impending
judgments
but
why
my
dear
friends
have
i
thus
been
endeavoring
to
lead
you
through
the
history
of
more
than
three
thousand
years
and
to
point
you
to
that
great
cloud
of
witnesses
who
have
gone
before
from
works
to
rewards
have
i
been
seeking
to
magnify
the
sufferings
and
exalt
the
character
of
woman
that
she
might
have
praise
of
men
no
no
my
object
has
been
to
arouse
as
the
wives
and
mothers
the
daughters
and
sisters
of
the
south
to
a
sense
of
your
duty
as
and
as
christian
women
on
that
great
subject
which
has
already
shaken
our
country
from
the
lawrence
and
the
lakes
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
from
the
mississippi
to
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
will
continue
mightily
to
shake
until
the
polluted
temple
of
slavery
fall
and
crumble
into
ruin
i
would
say
unto
each
one
of
you
what
meanest
thou
o
sleeper
arise
and
call
upon
thy
god
if
so
be
that
god
will
think
upon
us
that
we
perish
not
perceive
you
not
that
dark
cloud
of
vengeance
which
hangs
over
our
boasting
republic
saw
you
not
the
lightnings
of
heaven
wrath
in
the
flame
which
leaped
from
the
indian
torch
to
the
roof
of
yonder
dwelling
and
lighted
with
its
horrid
glare
the
darkness
of
midnight
heard
you
not
the
thunders
of
divine
anger
as
the
distant
roar
of
the
cannon
came
rolling
onward
from
the
texian
country
where
protestant
american
rebels
are
fighting
with
mexican
republicans
for
what
for
the
of
yes
of
american
slavery
in
the
bosom
of
a
catholic
republic
where
that
system
of
robbery
violence
and
wrong
had
been
legally
abolished
for
twelve
years
yes
citizens
of
the
united
states
after
plundering
mexico
of
her
land
are
now
engaged
in
deadly
conflict
for
the
privilege
of
fastening
chains
and
collars
and
manacles
upon
whom
upon
the
subjects
of
some
foreign
prince
no
upon
native
born
american
republican
citizens
although
the
fathers
of
these
very
men
declared
to
the
whole
world
while
struggling
to
free
themselves
the
three
penny
taxes
of
an
english
king
that
they
believed
it
to
be
a
truth
that
were
created
equal
and
had
an
right
to
well
may
the
poet
exclaim
in
bitter
sarcasm
the
fustian
flag
that
proudly
waves
in
solemn
mockery
land
of
can
you
not
my
friends
understand
the
signs
of
the
times
do
you
not
see
the
sword
of
retributive
justice
hanging
over
the
south
or
are
you
still
slumbering
at
your
posts
are
there
no
shiphrahs
no
puahs
among
you
who
will
dare
in
christian
firmness
and
christian
meekness
to
refuse
to
obey
the
which
require
to
enslave
to
degrade
and
to
brutalize
are
there
no
miriams
who
would
rejoice
to
lead
out
the
captive
daughters
of
the
southern
states
to
liberty
and
light
are
there
no
huldahs
there
who
will
dare
to
the
concerning
the
sins
of
the
people
and
those
judgments
which
it
requires
no
prophet
eye
to
see
must
follow
if
repentance
is
not
speedily
sought
is
there
no
esther
among
you
who
will
plead
for
the
poor
devoted
slave
read
the
history
of
this
persian
queen
it
is
full
of
instruction
she
at
first
refused
to
plead
for
the
jews
but
hear
the
words
of
mordecai
think
not
within
thyself
that
shalt
escape
in
the
king
house
more
than
all
the
jews
for
thou
altogether
holdest
thy
peace
at
this
then
shall
there
enlargement
and
deliverance
arise
to
the
jews
from
another
place
but
and
thy
father
house
shall
be
listen
too
to
her
magnanimous
reply
to
this
powerful
appeal
go
in
unto
the
king
which
is
according
to
law
and
if
i
perish
i
perish
yes
if
there
were
but
esther
at
the
south
she
save
her
country
from
ruin
but
let
the
christian
women
there
arise
at
the
christian
women
of
great
britain
did
in
the
majesty
of
moral
power
and
that
salvation
is
certain
let
them
embody
themselves
in
societies
and
send
petitions
up
to
their
different
legislatures
entreating
their
husbands
fathers
brothers
and
sons
to
abolish
the
institution
of
slavery
no
longer
to
subject
to
the
scourge
and
the
chain
to
mental
darkness
and
moral
degradation
no
longer
to
tear
husbands
from
their
wives
and
children
from
their
parents
no
longer
to
make
men
women
and
children
work
no
longer
to
make
their
lives
bitter
in
hard
bondage
no

to
reduce

the
abject
condition
of
of

no
longer
to
barter
the
of

human
shambles
for
corruptible
things
such
as
silver
and
gold
the
of
the
south
can
this
horrible
system
of
oppression
and
cruelty
licentiousness
and
wrong
such
appeals
to
your
legislatures
would
be
irresistible
for
there
is
something
in
the
heart
of
man
which
bend
under
moral
there
is
a
swift
witness
for
truth
in
his
bosom
will
respond
to
when
it
is
uttered
with
calmness
and
dignity
if
you
could
obtain
but
six
signatures
to
such
a
petition
in
only
one
state
i
would
say
send
up
that
petition
and
be
not
in
the
least
discouraged
by
the
scoffs
and
jeers
of
the
heartless
or
the
resolution
of
the
house
to
lay
it
on
the
table
it
will
be
a
great
thing
if
the
subject
can
be
introduced
into
your
legislatures
in
any
way
even
by
and
will
be
the
most
likely
to
introduce
it
there
in
the
best
possible
manner
as
a
matter
of
and
not
of
expediency
or
politics
you
may
petition
too
the
different
ecclesiastical
bodies
of
the
slave
states
slavery
must
be
attacked
with
the
whole
power
of
truth
and
the
sword
of
the
spirit
you
must
take
it
up
on
ground
and
fight
against
it
with
christian
weapons
whilst
your
feet
are
shod
with
the
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
and
are
loudly
called
upon
by
the
cries
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
to
arise
and
gird
yourselves
for
this
great
moral
conflict
with
the
whole
armour
of
righteousness
upon
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
there
is
every
encouragement
for
you
to
labor
and
pray
my
friends
because
the
abolition
of
slavery
as
well
as
its
existence
has
been
the
theme
of
prophecy
ethiopia
says
the
psalmist
shall
stretch
forth
her
hands
unto
god
and
is
she
not
now
doing
so
are
not
the
christian
negroes
of
the
south
lifting
their
hands
in
prayer
for
deliverance
just
as
the
israelites
did
when
their
redemption
was
drawing
nigh
are
they
not
sighing
and
crying
by
reason
of
the
hard
bondage
and
think
you
that
he
of
whom
it
was
said
and
god
heard
their
groaning
and
their
cry
came
up
unto
him
by
reason
of
the
hard
bondage
think
you
that
his
ear
is
heavy
that
he
can
not
hear
the
cries
of
his
suffering
children
or
that
he
who
raised
up
a
moses
an
aaron
and
a
miriam
to
bring
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
can
not
now
with
a
high
hand
and
a
stretched
out
arm
rid
the
poor
negroes
out
of
the
hands
of
their
masters
surely
you
believe
that
his
aim
is
shortened
that
he
can
not
save
and
would
not
such
a
work
of
mercy
redound
to
his
glory
but
another
string
of
the
harp
of
prophecy
vibrates
to
the
song
of
deliverance
but
they
shall
sit
every
man
under
his
vine
and
under
his
and
shall
make
them
afraid
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
spoken
it
the
never
can
do
this
as
long
as
he
is
a
whilst
he
is
a
chattel
personal
he
can
own
property
but
the
time
to
when
man
is
to
sit
under
vine
and
and
no
domineering
driver
or
irresponsible
master
or
irascible
mistress
shall
make
him
afraid
of
the
chain
or
the
whip
hear
too
the
sweet
tones
of
another
string
many
shall
run
to
and
fro
and
shall
be
slavery
is
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
increase
of
knowledge
in
every
community
where
it
exists
then
must
be
abolished
before
this
prediction
can
be
the
last
chord
i
shall
touch
will
be
this
they
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
then
must
be
overthrown
the
prophecies
can
be
accomplished
but
how
are
they
to
be
fulfiled
will
the
wheels
of
the
millennial
car
be
rolled
onward
by
miraculous
power
no
god
designs
to
confer
this
holy
privilege
upon
it
is
through
instrumentality
that
the
great
and
glorious
work
of
reforming
the
world
is
to
be
done
and
see
you
not
how
the
mighty
engine
of
is
dragging
in
its
rear
the
bible
and
peace
societies
and
temperance
sabbath
schools
moral
reform
and
missions
or
to
adopt
another
figure
do
not
these
seven
philanthropic
associations
compose
the
beautiful
tints
in
that
bow
of
promise
which
spans
the
arch
of
our
moral
heaven
who
does
not
believe
that
if
these
societies
were
broken
up
their
constitutions
burnt
and
the
vast
machinery
with
which
they
are
laboring
to
regenerate
mankind
was
stopped
that
the
black
clouds
of
vengeance
would
soon
burst
over
our
world
and
every
city
would
witness
the
fate
of
the
devoted
cities
of
the
plain
each
one
of
these
societies
is
walking
abroad
through
the
earth
scattering
the
seeds
of
truth
over
the
wide
field
of
our
world
not
with
the
hundred
hands
of
a
briareus
but
with
a
hundred
thousand
another
encouragement
for
you
to
labor
my
friends
is
that
you
will
have
the
prayers
and
of
english
and
northern
philanthropists
you
will
never
bend
your
knees
in
supplication
at
the
throne
of
grace
for
the
overthrow
of
slavery
without
meeting
there
the
spirits
of
other
christians
who
will
mingle
their
voices
with
yours
as
the
morning
or
evening
sacrifice
ascends
to
god
yes
the
spirit
of
prayer
and
of
supplication
has
been
poured
out
upon
many
many
hearts
there
are
wrestling
jacobs
who
will
not
let
go
of
the
prophetic
promises
of
deliverance
for
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
prison
doors
to
them
that
are
bound
there
are
pauls
who
are
saying
in
reference
to
this
subject
lord
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
there
are
marys
sitting
in
the
house
now
who
are
ready
to
arise
and
go
forth
in
this
work
as
soon
as
the
message
is
brought
the
master
is
come
and
calleth
for
thee
and
there
are
marthas
too
who
have
already
gone
out
to
meet
jesus
as
he
bends
his
footsteps
to
their
brother
grave
and
weeps
over
the
lifeless
body
of
lazarus
bound
hand
and
foot
in
but
over
the
politically
and
intellectually
lifeless
slave
bound
hand
and
foot
in
the
iron
chains
of
oppression
and
ignorance
some
may
be
ready
to
say
as
martha
did
who
seemed
to
expect
nothing
but
sympathy
from
jesus
lord
by
this
time
he
stinketh
for
he
hath
been
dead
four
days
she
thought
it
useless
to
remove
the
stone
and
expose
the
loathsome
body
of
her
brother
she
could
not
believe
that
so
great
a
miracle
could
be
wrought
as
to
raise
putrefied
into
life
but
jesus
said
take
away
too
stone
and
when
had
taken
away
the
stone
where
the
dead
was
laid
and
uncovered
the
body
of
lazarus
then
it
was
that
jesus
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
said
father
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
me
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
lazarus
come
forth
yes
some
may
be
ready
to
say
of
the
colored
race
how
can
ever
be
raised
politically
and
intellectually
they
have
been
dead
four
hundred
years
but
have
to
do
with
this
is
to
be
done
is
to
take
away
the
stone
which
has
covered
up
the
dead
body
of
our
brother
to
expose
the
putrid
carcass
to
show
that
body
has
been
bound
with
the
of
heathen
ignorance
and
his
face
with
the
napkin
of
prejudice
and
having
done
all
it
was
our
duty
to
do
to
stand
by
the
negro
grave
in
humble
faith
and
holy
hope
waiting
to
hear
the
command
of
lazarus
come
forth
this
is
just
what
societies
are
doing
they
are
taking
away
the
stone
from
the
mouth
of
the
tomb
of
slavery
where
lies
the
putrid
carcass
of
our
brother
they
want
the
pure
light
of
heaven
to
shine
into
that
dark
and
gloomy
cave
they
want
all
men
to
see
that
dead
body
has
been
bound
that
face
has
been
wrapped
in
the
of
and
shall
they
wait
beside
that
grave
in
vain
is
not
jesus
still
the
resurrection
and
the
life
did
he
come
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
prison
doors
to
them
that
are
bound
in
vain
did
he
promise
to
give
beauty
for
ashes
the
oil
of
joy
for
mourning
and
the
garment
of
praise
for
the
spirit
of
heaviness
unto
them
that
mourn
in
zion
and
will
he
refuse
to
beautify
the
mind
anoint
the
head
and
throw
around
the
captive
negro
the
mantle
of
praise
for
that
spirit
of
heaviness
which
has
so
long
bound
him
down
to
the
ground
or
shall
we
not
rather
say
with
the
prophet
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
perform
this
yes
his
promises
are
sure
and
amen
in
christ
jesus
that
he
will
assemble
her
that
halteth
and
gather
her
that
is
driven
out
and
her
that
is
afflicted
but
i
will
now
say
a
few
words
on
the
subject
of
abolitionism
doubtless
you
have
all
heard
societies
denounced
as
insurrectionary
and
mischievous
fanatical
and
dangerous
it
has
been
said
they
publish
the
most
abominable
untruths
and
that
they
are
endeavoring
to
excite
rebellions
at
the
south
have
you
believed
these
reports
my
friends
have
also
been
deceived
by
these
false
assertions
listen
to
me
then
whilst
i
endeavor
to
wipe
from
the
fair
character
of
abolitionism
such
unfounded
accusations
you
know
that
am
a
southerner
you
know
that
my
dearest
relatives
are
now
in
a
slave
slate
can
you
for
a
moment
believe
i
would
prove
so
recreant
to
the
feelings
of
a
daughter
and
a
sister
as
to
join
a
society
which
was
seeking
to
overthrow
slavery
by
falsehood
bloodshed
and
murder
i
appeal
to
you
who
have
known
and
loved
me
in
days
that
are
passed
can
believe
it
no
my
friends
as
a
carolinian
i
was
peculiarly
jealous
of
any
movements
on
this
subject
and
before
i
would
join
an
society
i
took
the
precaution
of
becoming
acquainted
with
some
of
the
leading
abolitionists
of
reading
their
publications
and
attending
their
meetings
at
which
i
heard
addresses
both
from
colored
and
white
men
and
it
was
not
until
i
was
fully
convicted
that
their
principles
were
and
their
efforts
that
i
gave
my
name
as
a
member
to
the
female
society
of
philadelphia
since
that
time
i
have
regularly
taken
the
liberator
and
read
many
pamphlets
and
papers
and
books
and
can
assure
you
i
never
have
seen
a
single
insurrectionary
paragraph
and
never
read
any
account
of
cruelty
which
i
could
not
believe
southerners
may
deny
the
truth
of
these
accounts
but
why
do
they
not
them
to
be
false
their
violent
expressions
of
horror
at
such
accounts
being
believed
deceive
some
but
they
can
not
deceive
for
i
lived
too
long
in
the
midst
of
slavery
not
to
know
what
slavery
is
when
i
speak
of
this
system
i
speak
that
i
do
know
and
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
to
assert
that
publications
have
overdrawn
the
monstrous
features
of
slavery
at
all
and
many
a
southerner
this
as
well
as
i
do
a
lady
in
north
carolina
remarked
to
a
friend
of
mine
about
eighteen
months
since
northerners
know
nothing
at
all
about
slavery
they
think
it
is
perpetual
bondage
only
but
of
the
of
that
word
involves
they
have
no
conception
if
they
had
would
never
their
efforts
until
so
a
system
was
overthrown
she
did
not
know
how
faithfully
some
northern
men
and
northern
women
had
studied
this
subject
how
diligently
they
had
searched
out
the
cause
of
him
who
had
none
to
help
him
and
how
fearlessly
they
had
told
the
story
of
the
negro
wrongs
yes
northerners
know
thing
about
slavery
now
this
monster
of
iniquity
has
been
unveiled
to
the
world
her
frightful
features
unmasked
and
soon
very
soon
will
she
be
regarded
with
no
more
complacency
by
the
american
republic
than
is
the
idol
of
juggernaut
rolling
its
bloody
wheels
over
the
crushed
bodies
of
its
prostrate
victims
but
you
will
probably
ask
if
societies
are
not
insurrectionary
why
do
northerners
tell
us
they
are
why
i
would
ask
you
in
return
did
northern
senators
and
northern
representatives
give
their
votes
at
the
last
sitting
of
congress
to
the
admission
of
arkansas
territory
as
a
state
take
those
men
one
by
one
and
ask
them
in
their
parlours
do
you
of
slavery
ask
them
on
ground
where
they
will
speak
the
truth
and
i
doubt
not
of
them
will
tell
you
why
then
i
ask
did
they
give
their
votes
to
enlarge
the
mouth
of
that
grave
which
has
already
destroyed
its
tens
of
thousands
all
our
enemies
tell
us
they
are
as
much
as
we
are
yes
my
friends
thousands
who
are
helping
you
to
bind
the
fetters
of
slavery
on
the
negro
despise
you
in
their
hearts
for
doing
it
they
rejoice
that
such
an
institution
has
not
been
entailed
upon
them
why
then
i
would
ask
do
they
lend
you
their
help
i
will
tell
you
they
love
praise
of
men
than
the
praise
of
god
the
abolition
cause
has
not
yet
become
so
popular
as
to
induce
them
to
believe
that
by
advocating
it
in
congress
they
shall
sit
still
more
securely
in
their
seats
there
and
like
the
in
the
days
of
our
saviour
though
believed
on
him
yet
they
did
confess
him
lest
they
should
put
out
of
the
john
xii
or
perhaps
like
pilate
thinking
they
could
prevail
nothing
and
fearing
a
tumult
they
determined
to
release
barabbas
and
surrender
the
just
man
the
poor
innocent
slave
to
be
stripped
of
his
rights
and
scourged
in
vain
will
such
men
try
to
wash
their
hands
and
say
with
the
roman
governor
i
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
person
northern
american
statesmen
are
no
more
innocent
of
the
crime
of
slavery
than
pilate
was
of
the
murder
of
jesus
or
saul
of
that
of
stephen
these
are
high
charges
but
i
appeal
to
i
appeal
to
public
opinion
ten
years
from
now
slavery
then
is
a
national
sin
but
you
will
say
a
great
many
other
northerners
tell
us
so
who
can
have
no
political
motives
the
interests
of
the
north
you
must
know
my
friends
are
very
closely
combined
with
those
of
the
south
the
northern
merchants
and
manufacturers
are
making
fortunes
out
of
the
of
slave
the
grocer
is
selling
your
rice
and
sugar
how
then
can
these
men
bear
a
testimony
against
slavery
without
condemning
themselves
but
there
is
another
reason
the
north
is
most
dreadfully
afraid
of
amalgamation
she
is
alarmed
at
the
very
idea
of
a
thing
so
monstrous
as
she
thinks
and
lest
this
consequence
flow
from
emancipation
she
is
determined
to
resist
all
efforts
at
emancipation
without
expatriation
it
is
not
because
approves
of
or
believes
it
to
be
the
corner
stone
of
our
republic
for
she
is
as
much
as
we
are
but
amalgamation
is
too
horrible
to
think
of
now
i
would
ask
is
it
right
is
it
generous
to
refuse
the
colored
people
in
this
country
the
advantages
of
education
and
the
privilege
or
rather
the
to
follow
honest
trades
and
callings
merely
because
they
are
colored
the
same
prejudice
exists
here
against
our
colored
brethren
that
existed
against
the
gentiles
in
judea
great
numbers
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
equality
and
fearing
lest
if
they
had
the
same
advantages
we
enjoy
they
would
become
as
intelligent
as
moral
as
religious
and
as
respectable
and
wealthy
they
are
determined
to
keep
them
as
low
as
they
possibly
can
is
this
doing
as
they
would
be
done
by
is
this
loving
their
neighbor
themselves
oh
that
opposers
of
abolitionism
would
put
their
souls
in
the
stead
of
the
free
colored
man
and
obey
the
apostolic
injunction
to
remember
them
that
are
in
bonds
bound
with
i
will
leave
you
to
judge
whether
the
fear
of
amalgamation
ought
to
induce
men
to
oppose
efforts
when
believe
to
be
prejudice
against
color
is
the
most
powerful
enemy
we
have
to
fight
with
at
the
north
you
need
not
be
surprised
then
at
all
at
what
is
said
abolitionists
by
the
north
for
they
are
wielding
a
sword
which
even
here
cuts
through
the
of
on
the
one
side
and
the
of
on
the
other
they
are
only
sharing
the
fate
of
other
reformers
abused
and
reviled
whilst
they
are
in
the
minority
but
they
are
neither
angry
nor
discouraged
by
the
invective
which
has
been
heaped
upon
them
by
slaveholders
at
the
south
and
their
apologists
at
the
north
they
know
that
when
george
fox
and
william
edmundson
were
laboring
in
behalf
of
the
negroes
in
the
west
indies
in
that
the
very
slanders
were
propogated
against
them
which
are
circulated
against
abolitionists
although
it
was
well
known
that
fox
was
the
founder
of
a
religious
sect
which
repudiated
war
and
violence
yet
was
accused
of
endeavoring
to
excite
the
slaves
to
insurrection
and
of
teaching
the
negroes
to
cut
their
master
throats
and
these
two
men
who
had
their
feet
shod
with
the
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
were
actually
compelled
to
draw
up
a
formal
declaration
that
were
trying
to
raise
a
rebellion
in
barbadoes
it
is
also
worthy
of
remark
that
these
reformers
did
not
at
this
time
see
the
necessity
of
emancipation
under
seven
years
and
their
principal
efforts
were
exerted
to
persuade
the
planters
of
the
necessity
of
instructing
their
slaves
but
the
slaveholder
saw
then
just
what
the
slaveholder
sees
now
that
an
population
never
can
be
a
population
and
therefore
they
passed
a
law
that
negroes
should
not
even
attend
the
meetings
of
friends
abolitionists
know
that
the
life
of
clarkson
was
sought
by
slavetraders
and
that
even
wilberforce
was
denounced
on
the
floor
of
parliament
as
a
fanatic
and
a
hypocrite
by
the
present
king
of
england
the
very
man
who
in
set
his
seal
to
that
instrument
which
burst
the
fetters
of
eight
hundred
thousand
slaves
in
his
west
india
colonies
they
know
that
the
first
quaker
who
bore
a
testimony
against
the
sin
of
slavery
was
cut
off
from
religious
fellowship
with
that
society
that
quaker
was
a
on
her
deathbed
she
sent
for
the
committe
who
dealt
with
her
she
told
them
the
near
approach
of
death
had
not
altered
her
sentiments
on
the
subject
of
slavery
and
waving
her
hand
towards
a
very
fertile
and
beautiful
portion
of
country
which
lay
stretched
before
her
window
she
said
with
great
solemnity
friends
the
time
will
come
when
there
will
not
be
friends
enough
in
all
this
district
to
hold
one
meeting
for
worship
and
this
garden
will
be
turned
into
a
wilderness
the
aged
friend
who
with
tears
in
his
eyes
related
this
interesting
circumstance
to
me
remarked
that
at
that
time
there
were
seven
meetings
of
friends
in
that
part
of
virginia
but
that
when
he
was
there
ten
years
ago
not
a
single
meeting
was
held
and
the
country
was
literally
a
desolation
soon
after
her
decease
john
woolman
began
his
labors
in
our
society
and
instead
of
disowning
a
member
for
testifying
slavery
they
have
for
years
positively
forbidden
their
members
to
hold
slaves
abolitionists
understand
the
slaveholding
spirit
too
well
to
be
surprised
at
any
thing
that
has
yet
happened
at
the
south
or
the
north
they
know
that
the
greater
the
sin
is
which
is
exposed
the
more
violent
will
be
the
efforts
to
blacken
the
character
and
impugn
the
motives
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
bringing
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
darkness
they
understand
the
work
of
reform
too
well
to
be
driven
back
by
the
furious
waves
of
opposition
which
are
only
foaming
out
their
own
shame
they
have
stood
the
world
dread
laugh
when
only
twelve
men
formed
the
first
society
in
boston
in
they
have
faced
and
refuted
the
calumnies
at
their
enemies
and
proved
themselves
to
be
emphatically
by
the
violence
of
mobs
even
when
driven
by
them
from
the
temple
of
god
and
dragged
by
an
infuriated
crowd
through
the
streets
of
the
emporium
of
or
subjected
by
to
the
pain
of
corporal
punishment
none
of
these
things
move
them
and
by
the
grace
of
god
they
are
determined
to
persevere
in
this
work
of
faith
and
labor
of
love
they
mean
to
pray
and
preach
and
write
and
print
until
slavery
is
completely
overthrown
until
babylon
is
taken
up
and
cast
into
the
sea
to
be
found
no
more
at
all
they
mean
to
petition
congress
year
after
year
until
the
seat
of
our
government
is
cleansed
from
the
sinful
traffic
of
slaves
and
the
souls
of
men
although
that
august
assembly
may
be
like
the
unjust
judge
who
feared
not
god
neither
regarded
man
yet
it
yield
just
as
he
did
from
the
power
of
importunity
like
the
unjust
judge
congress
redress
the
wrongs
of
the
widow
lest
by
the
continual
coming
up
of
petitions
it
be
wearied
this
will
be
striking
the
dagger
into
the
very
heart
of
the
monster
and
once
is
done
he
must
soon
expire
abolitionists
have
been
accused
of
abusing
their
southern
brethren
did
the
prophet
isaiah
the
jews
when
he
addressed
to
them
the
cutting
reproofs
contained
in
the
first
chapter
of
his
prophecies
and
ended
by
telling
them
they
would
be
of
the
oaks
they
had
desired
and
for
the
garden
they
had
chosen
did
john
the
baptist
the
jews
when
he
called
them
generation
of
and
warned
them
to
bring
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
did
peter
abuse
the
jews
when
he
told
them
they
were
the
murderers
of
the
lord
of
glory
did
paul
abuse
the
roman
governor
when
he
reasoned
before
him
of
righteousness
temperance
and
judgment
so
as
to
send
conviction
home
to
his
guilty
heart
and
cause
him
to
tremble
in
view
of
the
crimes
he
was
living
in
surely
not
no
man
will
accuse
the
prophets
and
apostles
of
but
what
have
abolitionists
done
more
than
they
no
doubt
the
jews
thought
the
prophets
and
apostles
in
their
day
just
as
harsh
and
uncharitable
as
slaveholders
now
think
abolitionists
if
they
did
not
why
did
they
beat
and
stone
and
kill
them
great
fault
has
been
found
with
the
prints
which
have
been
employed
to
expose
slavery
at
the
north
but
my
friends
how
could
this
be
done
so
effectually
in
any
other
way
until
the
pictures
of
the
sufferings
were
drawn
and
held
up
to
public
gaze
no
northerner
had
any
idea
of
the
cruelty
of
the
system
it
never
entered
their
minds
that
such
abominations
could
exist
in
christian
republican
america
they
never
suspected
that
many
of
the
and
who
came
from
the
south
to
spend
the
summer
months
in
travelling
among
them
were
petty
tyrants
at
home
and
those
who
had
lived
at
the
south
and
came
to
reside
at
the
north
were
too
of
even
to
speak
of
it
the
language
of
their
hearts
was
tell
it
in
gath
publish
it
in
the
streets
of
askelon
they
saw
no
use
in
uncovering
the
loathsome
body
to
popular
sight
and
in
hopeless
despair
wept
in
secret
places
over
the
sins
of
oppression
to
such
hidden
mourners
the
formation
of
societies
was
as
life
from
the
dead
the
first
beams
of
hope
which
gleamed
through
the
dark
clouds
of
despondency
and
grief
prints
were
made
use
of
to
effect
the
abolition
of
the
inquisition
in
spain
and
clarkson
employed
them
when
he
was
laboring
to
break
up
the
slave
trade
and
english
abolitionists
used
them
just
as
we
are
now
doing
they
are
powerful
appeals
and
have
invariably
done
the
work
they
were
designed
to
do
and
we
can
not
consent
to
abandon
the
use
of
these
until
the
no
longer
exist
with
regard
to
those
white
men
who
it
was
said
did
try
to
raise
an
insurrection
in
mississippi
a
year
ago
and
who
were
stated
to
be
abolitionists
none
of
them
were
proved
to
be
members
of
societies
and
it
must
remain
a
matter
of
great
doubt
whether
even
they
were
guilty
of
the
crimes
alledged
against
them
because
when
any
community
is
thrown
into
such
a
panic
as
to
inflict
lynch
law
upon
accused
persons
they
can
not
be
supposed
to
be
capable
of
judging
with
calmness
and
impartiality
that
the
papers
of
which
the
charleston
mail
was
robbed
were
insurrectionary
and
that
they
were
sent
to
the
colored
people
as
was
reported
that
amos
dresser
was
though
he
was
accused
of
being
so
and
on
this
false
accusation
was
publicly
whipped
in
nashville
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
infuriated
was
that
young
man
disgraced
by
this
infliction
of
corporal
punishment
no
more
than
was
the
great
apostle
of
the
gentiles
who
five
times
received
forty
stripes
save
one
like
him
he
might
have
said
henceforth
i
bear
in
my
body
the
marks
of
the
lord
jesus
for
it
was
for
the
sake
he
as
much
as
did
the
apostle
paul
are
nelson
and
garrett
and
williams
and
other
abolitionists
who
have
recently
been
banished
from
missouri
insurrectionists
they
are
whatever
slaveholders
may
choose
to
call
them
the
spirit
which
now
asperses
the
character
of
the
abolitionists
is
the
which
dressed
up
the
christians
of
spain
in
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
and
pictures
of
devils
when
they
were
led
to
execution
as
heretics
before
we
condemn
individuals
it
is
necessary
even
in
a
wicked
community
to
accuse
them
of
some
crime
hence
when
jezebel
wished
to
compass
the
death
of
naboth
men
of
belial
were
suborned
to
bear
witness
against
him
and
so
it
was
with
stephen
and
so
it
ever
has
been
and
ever
will
be
as
long
as
there
is
any
virtue
to
suffer
on
the
rack
or
the
gallows
witnesses
must
appear
against
abolitionists
before
they
can
be
condemned
i
will
now
say
a
few
words
on
george
thompson
mission
to
this
country
this
philanthropist
was
accused
of
being
a
foreign
emissary
were
la
fayette
and
steuben
and
de
kalb
foreign
emissaries
when
they
came
over
to
america
to
fight
against
the
tories
who
preferred
submitting
to
what
was
termed
the
yoke
of
servitude
rather
than
bursting
the
fetters
which
bound
them
to
the
mother
country
came
with
to
engage
in
conflict
against
american
citizens
and
yet
where
do
their
names
stand
on
the
page
of
history
among
the
honorable
or
the
low
thompson
came
here
to
war
against
the
giant
sin
of
slavery
not
with
the
sword
and
the
pistol
but
with
the
smooth
stones
of
oratory
taken
from
the
pure
waters
of
the
river
of
truth
his
splendid
talents
and
commanding
eloquence
rendered
him
a
powerful
coadjutor
in
the
cause
and
in
order
to
neutralize
the
effects
of
these
upon
his
auditors
and
rob
the
poor
slave
of
the
benefits
of
his
labors
his
character
was
defamed
his
life
was
sought
and
he
at
last
driven
from
our
republic
as
a
fugitive
but
was
disgraced
by
all
this
mean
and
contemptible
and
wicked
chicanery
and
malice
no
more
than
was
paul
when
in
consequence
of
a
vision
he
had
seen
at
troas
he
went
over
to
macedonia
to
help
the
christians
there
and
was
beaten
and
imprisoned
because
he
cast
out
a
spirit
of
divination
from
a
young
damsel
which
had
brought
much
gain
to
her
masters
paul
was
as
much
a
foreign
emissary
in
the
roman
colony
of
philippi
as
george
thompson
was
in
america
and
it
was
because
he
was
a
and
taught
customs
it
was
not
lawful
for
them
to
receive
or
observe
being
romans
that
the
apostle
was
thus
treated
it
was
said
thompson
was
a
felon
who
had
fled
to
this
country
to
escape
transportation
to
new
holland
look
at
him
now
pouring
the
thundering
strains
of
his
eloquence
upon
crowded
audiences
in
great
britain
and
see
in
this
a
triumphant
vindication
of
his
character
and
have
the
slaveholder
and
his
obsequious
apologist
gained
any
thing
by
all
their
violence
and
falsehood
no
for
the
stone
which
struck
goliath
of
gath
had
already
been
thrown
from
the
sling
the
giant
of
slavery
who
had
so
proudly
defied
the
armies
of
the
living
god
had
received
his
before
he
left
our
shores
but
what
is
george
thompson
doing
there
is
he
not
now
laboring
there
as
effectually
to
abolish
american
slavery
as
though
he
trod
our
own
soil
and
lectured
to
new
york
or
boston
assemblies
what
is
he
doing
there
but
constructing
a
stupendous
dam
which
will
turn
the
overwhelming
tide
of
public
opinion
over
the
wheels
of
that
machinery
which
abolitionists
are
working
here
he
is
now
lecturing
to
on
to
the
of
a
on
the
abject
condition
of
the
of
a
he
is
telling
them
of
that
mighty
confederacy
of
petty
tyrants
which
extends
over
thirteen
states
of
our
union
he
is
telling
them
of
the
munificent
rewards
offered
by
slaveholders
for
the
heads
of
the
most
distinguished
advocates
for
freedom
in
this
country
he
is
moving
the
british
churches
to
send
out
to
the
churches
of
america
the
most
solemn
appeals
reproving
rebuking
and
exhorting
them
with
all
long
suffering
and
patience
to
abandon
the
sin
of
slavery
immediately
where
then
i
ask
will
the
name
of
george
thompson
stand
on
the
page
of
history
among
the
honorable
or
the
base
what
can
i
say
more
my
friends
to
induce
to
set
your
hands
and
heads
and
hearts
to
this
great
work
of
justice
and
mercy
perhaps
you
have
feared
the
consequences
of
immediate
emancipation
and
been
frightened
by
all
those
dreadful
prophecies
of
rebellion
bloodshed
and
murder
which
have
been
uttered
let
no
man
deceive
you
they
are
the
predictions
of
that
same
lying
spirit
which
spoke
through
the
four
hundred
prophets
of
old
to
ahab
king
of
israel
urging
him
on
to
destruction
may
produce
these
horrible
scenes
if
it
is
continued
five
years
longer
but
emancipation
i
can
prove
the
of
immediate
emancipation
by
history
in
domingo
in
six
hundred
thousand
slaves
were
set
free
in
a
white
population
of
thousand
that
island
marched
as
by
enchantment
towards
its
ancient
splendor
cultivation
prospered
every
day
produced
perceptible
proofs
of
its
progress
and
the
negroes
all
continued
quietly
to
work
on
the
different
plantations
until
in
france
determined
to
reduce
these
liberated
slaves
again
to
bondage
it
was
at
that
all
those
dreadful
scenes
of
cruelty
occured
which
we
so
often
hear
spoken
of
as
the
effects
of
abolition
they
were
occasioned
by
emancipation
but
by
the
base
attempt
to
fasten
the
chains
of
slavery
on
the
limbs
of
liberated
slaves
in
gaudaloape
thousand
slaves
were
freed
in
a
white
population
of
thirteen
thousand
the
same
prosperous
effects
followed
manumission
here
that
had
attended
it
in
hayti
every
thing
was
quiet
until
buonaparte
sent
out
a
fleet
to
reduce
these
negroes
again
to
slavery
and
in
this
institution
was
in
that
island
in
when
great
britain
determined
to
liberate
the
slaves
in
her
west
india
colonies
and
proposed
the
apprenticeship
system
the
planters
of
bermuda
and
antigua
after
having
joined
the
other
planters
in
their
representations
of
the
bloody
consequences
of
emancipation
in
order
if
possible
to
hold
back
the
hand
which
was
offering
the
boon
of
freedom
to
the
poor
negro
as
soon
as
they
found
such
falsehoods
were
utterly
disregarded
and
abolition
must
take
place
came
forward
voluntarily
and
asked
for
the
compensation
which
was
due
to
them
saying
preferred
immediate
and
were
not
afraid
of
any
insurrection
and
how
is
it
with
these
islands
now
they
are
decidedly
more
prosperous
than
any
of
those
in
which
the
apprenticeship
system
was
adopted
and
england
is
now
trying
to
abolish
that
system
so
fully
convinced
is
she
that
immediate
emancipation
is
the
safest
and
the
best
plan
and
why
not
try
it
in
the
southern
states
if
it
never
has
occasioned
rebellion
if
a
of
has
ever
been
shed
in
consequence
of
it
though
it
has
been
so
often
tried
why
should
we
suppose
it
would
produce
such
disastrous
consequences
now
be
not
deceived
then
god
is
not
mocked
by
such
false
excuses
for
not
doing
justly
and
loving
mercy
there
is
nothing
to
fear
from
immediate
emancipation
but
from
the
continuance
of
slavery
sisters
in
christ
i
have
done
as
a
southerner
i
have
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
address
you
i
have
endeavoured
to
set
before
you
the
exceeding
sinfulness
of
slavery
and
to
point
you
to

noble
women
who
have
been
raised
up
in

effect
great
revolutions

to
suffer

i
have
appealed
to
your
sympathies
as
women
to
your
sense
of
duty
as
i
have
attempted
to
vindicate
the
abolitionists
to
prove
the
entire
safety
of
immediate
emancipation
and
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
poor

have
sowed

i
well
know

even

an

follow

can
give

fervent

that
as
he
hath
the
weak
things
of
the

confound
the
things
which
are
mighty
so
he
may
cause
his
