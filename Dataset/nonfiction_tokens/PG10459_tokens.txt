this
book
i
i
have
desired
like
every
artist
to
create
a
little
world
out
of
the
beautiful
pleasant
and
significant
things
of
this
marred
and
clumsy
world
and
to
show
in
a
vision
something
of
the
face
of
ireland
to
any
of
my
own
people
who
would
look
where
i
bid
them
i
have
therefore
written
down
accurately
and
candidly
much
that
i
have
heard
and
seen
and
except
by
way
of
commentary
nothing
that
i
have
merely
imagined
i
have
however
been
at
no
pains
to
separate
my
own
beliefs
from
those
of
the
peasantry
but
have
rather
let
my
men
and
women
dhouls
and
faeries
go
their
way
unoffended
or
defended
by
any
argument
of
mine
the
things
a
man
has
heard
and
seen
are
threads
of
life
and
if
he
pull
them
carefully
from
the
confused
distaff
of
memory
any
who
will
can
weave
them
into
whatever
garments
of
belief
please
them
best
i
too
have
woven
my
garment
like
another
but
i
shall
try
to
keep
warm
in
it
and
shall
be
well
content
if
it
do
not
unbecome
me
hope
and
memory
have
one
daughter
and
her
name
is
art
and
she
has
built
her
dwelling
far
from
the
desperate
field
where
men
hang
out
their
garments
upon
forked
boughs
to
be
banners
of
battle
o
beloved
daughter
of
hope
and
memory
be
with
me
for
a
little
ii
i
have
added
a
few
more
chapters
in
the
manner
of
the
old
ones
and
would
have
added
others
but
one
loses
as
one
grows
older
something
of
the
lightness
of
one
dreams
one
begins
to
take
life
up
in
both
hands
and
to
care
more
for
the
fruit
than
the
flower
and
that
is
no
great
loss
per
haps
in
these
new
chapters
as
in
the
old
ones
i
have
invented
nothing
but
my
comments
and
one
or
two
deceitful
sentences
that
may
keep
some
poor
commerce
with
the
devil
and
his
angels
or
the
like
from
being
known
among
his
neighbours
i
shall
publish
in
a
little
while
a
big
book
about
the
commonwealth
of
faery
and
shall
try
to
make
it
systematical
and
learned
enough
to
buy
pardon
for
this
handful
of
dreams
yeats
a
teller
of
tales
many
of
the
tales
in
this
book
were
told
me
by
one
paddy
flynn
a
little
old
man
who
lived
in
a
leaky
and
cabin
in
the
village
of
ballisodare
which
is
he
was
wont
to
say
the
most
gentle
whereby
he
meant
faery
place
in
the
whole
of
county
sligo
others
hold
it
however
but
second
to
drumcliff
and
drumahair
the
first
time
i
saw
him
he
was
cooking
mushrooms
for
himself
the
next
time
he
was
asleep
under
a
hedge
smiling
in
his
sleep
he
was
indeed
always
cheerful
though
i
thought
i
could
see
in
his
eyes
swift
as
the
eyes
of
a
rabbit
when
they
peered
out
of
their
wrinkled
holes
a
melancholy
which
was
a
portion
of
their
joy
the
visionary
melancholy
of
purely
instinctive
natures
and
of
all
animals
and
yet
there
was
much
in
his
life
to
depress
him
for
in
the
triple
solitude
of
age
eccentricity
and
deafness
he
went
about
much
pestered
by
children
it
was
for
this
very
reason
perhaps
that
he
ever
recommended
mirth
and
hopefulness
he
was
fond
for
instance
of
telling
how
collumcille
cheered
up
his
mother
how
are
you
mother
said
the
saint
worse
replied
the
mother
may
you
be
worse
said
the
saint
the
next
day
collumcille
came
again
and
exactly
the
same
conversation
took
place
but
the
third
day
the
mother
said
better
thank
god
and
the
saint
replied
may
you
be
better
he
was
fond
too
of
telling
how
the
judge
smiles
at
the
last
day
alike
when
he
rewards
the
good
and
condemns
the
lost
to
unceasing
flames
he
had
many
strange
sights
to
keep
him
cheerful
or
to
make
him
sad
i
asked
him
had
he
ever
seen
the
faeries
and
got
the
reply
am
i
not
annoyed
with
them
i
asked
too
if
he
had
ever
seen
the
banshee
i
have
seen
it
he
said
down
there
by
the
water
batting
the
river
with
its
hands
i
have
copied
this
account
of
paddy
flynn
with
a
few
verbal
alterations
from
a
which
i
almost
filled
with
his
tales
and
sayings
shortly
after
seeing
him
i
look
now
at
the
regretfully
for
the
blank
pages
at
the
end
will
never
be
filled
up
paddy
flynn
is
dead
a
friend
of
mine
gave
him
a
large
bottle
of
whiskey
and
though
a
sober
man
at
most
times
the
sight
of
so
much
liquor
filled
him
with
a
great
enthusiasm
and
he
lived
upon
it
for
some
days
and
then
died
his
body
worn
out
with
old
age
and
hard
times
could
not
bear
the
drink
as
in
his
young
days
he
was
a
great
teller
of
tales
and
unlike
our
common
romancers
knew
how
to
empty
heaven
hell
and
purgatory
faeryland
and
earth
to
people
his
stories
he
did
not
live
in
a
shrunken
world
but
knew
of
no
less
ample
circumstance
than
did
homer
himself
perhaps
the
gaelic
people
shall
by
his
like
bring
back
again
the
ancient
simplicity
and
amplitude
of
imagination
what
is
literature
but
the
expression
of
moods
by
the
vehicle
of
symbol
and
incident
and
are
there
not
moods
which
need
heaven
hell
purgatory
and
faeryland
for
their
expression
no
less
than
this
dilapidated
earth
nay
are
there
not
moods
which
shall
find
no
expression
unless
there
be
men
who
dare
to
mix
heaven
hell
purgatory
and
faeryland
together
or
even
to
set
the
heads
of
beasts
to
the
bodies
of
men
or
to
thrust
the
souls
of
men
into
the
heart
of
rocks
let
us
go
forth
the
tellers
of
tales
and
seize
whatever
prey
the
heart
long
for
and
have
no
fear
everything
exists
everything
is
true
and
the
earth
is
only
a
little
dust
under
our
feet
belief
and
unbelief
there
are
some
doubters
even
in
the
western
villages
one
woman
told
me
last
christmas
that
she
did
not
believe
either
in
hell
or
in
ghosts
hell
she
thought
was
merely
an
invention
got
up
by
the
priest
to
keep
people
good
and
ghosts
would
not
be
permitted
she
held
to
go
trapsin
about
the
earth
at
their
own
free
will
but
there
are
faeries
she
added
and
little
leprechauns
and
and
fallen
angels
i
have
met
also
a
man
with
a
mohawk
indian
tattooed
upon
his
arm
who
held
exactly
similar
beliefs
and
unbeliefs
no
matter
what
one
doubts
one
never
doubts
the
faeries
for
as
the
man
with
the
mohawk
indian
on
his
arm
said
to
me
they
stand
to
reason
even
the
official
mind
does
not
escape
this
faith
a
little
girl
who
was
at
service
in
the
village
of
grange
close
under
the
seaward
slopes
of
ben
bulben
suddenly
disappeared
one
night
about
three
years
ago
there
was
at
once
great
excitement
in
the
neighbourhood
because
it
was
rumoured
that
the
faeries
had
taken
her
a
villager
was
said
to
have
long
struggled
to
hold
her
from
them
but
at
last
they
prevailed
and
he
found
nothing
in
his
hands
but
a
broomstick
the
local
constable
was
applied
to
and
he
at
once
instituted
a
search
and
at
the
same
time
advised
the
people
to
burn
all
the
bucalauns
ragweed
on
the
field
she
vanished
from
because
bucalauns
are
sacred
to
the
faeries
they
spent
the
whole
night
burning
them
the
constable
repeating
spells
the
while
in
the
morning
the
little
girl
was
found
the
story
goes
wandering
in
the
field
she
said
the
faeries
had
taken
her
away
a
great
distance
riding
on
a
faery
horse
at
last
she
saw
a
big
river
and
the
man
who
had
tried
to
keep
her
from
being
carried
off
was
drifting
down
it
such
are
the
of
faery
glamour
in
a
cockleshell
on
the
way
her
companions
had
mentioned
the
names
of
several
people
who
were
about
to
die
shortly
in
the
village
perhaps
the
constable
was
right
it
is
better
doubtless
to
believe
much
unreason
and
a
little
truth
than
to
deny
for
denial
sake
truth
and
unreason
alike
for
when
we
do
this
we
have
not
even
a
rush
candle
to
guide
our
steps
not
even
a
poor
sowlth
to
dance
before
us
on
the
marsh
and
must
needs
fumble
our
way
into
the
great
emptiness
where
dwell
the
dhouls
and
after
all
can
we
come
to
so
great
evil
if
we
keep
a
little
fire
on
our
hearths
and
in
our
souls
and
welcome
with
open
hand
whatever
of
excellent
come
to
warm
itself
whether
it
be
man
or
phantom
and
do
not
say
too
fiercely
even
to
the
dhouls
themselves
be
ye
gone
when
all
is
said
and
done
how
do
we
not
know
but
that
our
own
unreason
may
be
better
than
another
truth
for
it
has
been
warmed
on
our
hearths
and
in
our
souls
and
is
ready
for
the
wild
bees
of
truth
to
hive
in
it
and
make
their
sweet
honey
come
into
the
world
again
wild
bees
wild
bees
mortal
help
one
hears
in
the
old
poems
of
men
taken
away
to
help
the
gods
in
a
battle
and
cuchullan
won
the
goddess
fand
for
a
while
by
helping
her
married
sister
and
her
sister
husband
to
overthrow
another
nation
of
the
land
of
promise
i
have
been
told
too
that
the
people
of
faery
can
not
even
play
at
hurley
unless
they
have
on
either
side
some
mortal
whose
body
or
whatever
has
been
put
in
its
place
as
the
would
say
is
asleep
at
home
without
mortal
help
they
are
shadowy
and
can
not
even
strike
the
balls
one
day
i
was
walking
over
some
marshy
land
in
galway
with
a
friend
when
we
found
an
old
man
digging
a
ditch
my
friend
had
heard
that
this
man
had
seen
a
wonderful
sight
of
some
kind
and
at
last
we
got
the
story
out
of
him
when
he
was
a
boy
he
was
working
one
day
with
about
thirty
men
and
women
and
boys
they
were
beyond
tuam
and
not
far
from
presently
they
saw
all
thirty
of
them
and
at
a
distance
of
about
some
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
people
of
faery
there
were
two
of
them
he
said
in
dark
clothes
like
people
of
our
own
time
who
stood
about
a
hundred
yards
from
one
another
but
the
others
wore
clothes
of
all
colours
bracket
or
chequered
and
some
with
red
waistcoats
he
could
not
see
what
they
were
doing
but
all
might
have
been
playing
hurley
for
they
looked
as
if
it
was
that
sometimes
they
would
vanish
and
then
he
would
almost
swear
they
came
back
out
of
the
bodies
of
the
two
men
in
dark
clothes
these
two
men
were
of
the
size
of
living
men
but
the
others
were
small
he
saw
them
for
about
hour
and
then
the
old
man
he
and
those
about
him
were
working
for
took
up
a
whip
and
said
get
on
get
on
or
we
will
have
no
work
done
i
asked
if
he
saw
the
faeries
too
oh
yes
but
he
did
not
want
work
he
was
paying
wages
for
to
be
neglected
he
made
every
body
work
so
hard
that
nobody
saw
what
happened
to
the
faeries
a
visionary
a
young
man
came
to
see
me
at
my
lodgings
the
other
night
and
began
to
talk
of
the
making
of
the
earth
and
the
heavens
and
much
else
i
questioned
him
about
his
life
and
his
doings
he
had
written
many
poems
and
painted
many
mystical
designs
since
we
met
last
but
latterly
had
neither
written
nor
painted
for
his
whole
heart
was
set
upon
making
his
mind
strong
vigorous
and
calm
and
the
emotional
life
of
the
artist
was
bad
for
him
he
feared
he
recited
his
poems
readily
however
he
had
them
all
in
his
memory
some
indeed
had
never
been
written
down
they
with
their
wild
music
as
of
winds
blowing
in
the
reeds
fn
seemed
to
me
the
very
inmost
voice
of
celtic
sadness
and
of
celtic
longing
for
infinite
things
the
world
has
never
seen
suddenly
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
peering
about
him
a
little
eagerly
do
you
see
anything
x
i
said
a
shining
winged
woman
covered
by
her
long
hair
is
standing
near
the
doorway
he
answered
or
some
such
words
is
it
the
influence
of
some
living
person
who
thinks
of
us
and
whose
thoughts
appear
to
us
in
that
symbolic
form
i
said
for
i
am
well
instructed
in
the
ways
of
the
visionaries
and
in
the
fashion
of
their
speech
no
he
replied
for
if
it
were
the
thoughts
of
a
person
who
is
alive
i
should
feel
the
living
influence
in
my
living
body
and
my
heart
would
beat
and
my
breath
would
fail
it
is
a
spirit
it
is
some
one
who
is
dead
or
who
has
never
lived
fn
i
wrote
this
sentence
long
ago
this
sadness
now
seems
to
me
a
part
of
all
peoples
who
preserve
the
moods
of
the
ancient
peoples
of
the
world
i
am
not
so
with
the
mystery
of
race
as
i
used
to
be
but
leave
this
sentence
and
other
sentences
like
it
unchanged
we
once
believed
them
and
have
it
may
be
not
grown
wiser
i
asked
what
he
was
doing
and
found
he
was
clerk
in
a
large
shop
his
pleasure
however
was
to
wander
about
upon
the
hills
talking
to
mad
and
visionary
peasants
or
to
persuade
queer
and
stricken
persons
to
deliver
up
the
keeping
of
their
troubles
into
his
care
another
night
when
i
was
with
him
in
his
own
lodging
more
than
one
turned
up
to
talk
over
their
beliefs
and
disbeliefs
and
sun
them
as
it
were
in
the
subtle
light
of
his
mind
sometimes
visions
come
to
him
as
he
talks
with
them
and
he
is
rumoured
to
have
told
divers
people
true
matters
of
their
past
days
and
distant
friends
and
left
them
hushed
with
dread
of
their
strange
teacher
who
seems
scarce
more
than
a
boy
and
is
so
much
more
subtle
than
the
oldest
among
them
the
poetry
he
recited
me
was
full
of
his
nature
and
his
visions
sometimes
it
told
of
other
lives
he
believes
himself
to
have
lived
in
other
centuries
sometimes
of
people
he
had
talked
to
revealing
them
to
their
own
minds
i
told
him
i
would
write
an
article
upon
him
and
it
and
was
told
in
turn
that
i
might
do
so
if
i
did
not
mention
his
name
for
he
wished
to
be
always
unknown
obscure
impersonal
next
day
a
bundle
of
his
poems
arrived
and
with
them
a
note
in
these
words
here
are
copies
of
verses
you
said
you
liked
i
do
not
think
i
could
ever
write
or
paint
any
more
i
prepare
myself
for
a
cycle
of
other
activities
in
some
other
life
i
will
make
rigid
my
roots
and
branches
it
is
not
now
my
turn
to
burst
into
leaves
and
flowers
the
poems
were
all
endeavours
to
capture
some
high
impalpable
mood
in
a
net
of
obscure
images
there
were
fine
passages
in
all
but
these
were
often
embedded
in
thoughts
which
have
evidently
a
special
value
to
his
mind
but
are
to
other
men
the
counters
of
an
unknown
coinage
to
them
they
seem
merely
so
much
brass
or
copper
or
tarnished
silver
at
the
best
at
other
times
the
beauty
of
the
thought
was
obscured
by
careless
writing
as
though
he
had
suddenly
doubted
if
writing
was
not
a
foolish
labour
he
had
frequently
illustrated
his
verses
with
drawings
in
which
an
unperfect
anatomy
did
not
altogether
hide
extreme
beauty
of
feeling
the
faeries
in
whom
he
believes
have
given
him
many
subjects
notably
thomas
of
ercildoune
sitting
motionless
in
the
twilight
while
a
young
and
beautiful
creature
leans
softly
out
of
the
shadow
and
whispers
in
his
ear
he
had
delighted
above
all
in
strong
effects
of
colour
spirits
who
have
upon
their
heads
instead
of
hair
the
feathers
of
peacocks
a
phantom
reaching
from
a
swirl
of
flame
towards
a
star
a
spirit
passing
with
a
globe
of
iridescent
of
the
half
shut
within
his
hand
but
always
under
this
largess
of
colour
lay
some
tender
homily
addressed
to
man
fragile
hopes
this
spiritual
eagerness
draws
to
him
all
those
who
like
himself
seek
for
illumination
or
else
mourn
for
a
joy
that
has
gone
one
of
these
especially
comes
to
mind
a
winter
or
two
ago
he
spent
much
of
the
night
walking
up
and
down
upon
the
mountain
talking
to
an
old
peasant
who
dumb
to
most
men
poured
out
his
cares
for
him
both
were
unhappy
x
because
he
had
then
first
decided
that
art
and
poetry
were
not
for
him
and
the
old
peasant
because
his
life
was
ebbing
out
with
no
achievement
remaining
and
no
hope
left
him
both
how
celtic
how
full
of
striving
after
a
something
never
to
be
completely
expressed
in
word
or
deed
the
peasant
was
wandering
in
his
mind
with
prolonged
sorrow
once
he
burst
out
with
god
possesses
the
heavens
god
possesses
the
heavens
but
he
covets
the
world
and
once
he
lamented
that
his
old
neighbours
were
gone
and
that
all
had
forgotten
him
they
used
to
draw
a
chair
to
the
fire
for
him
in
every
cabin
and
now
they
said
who
is
that
old
fellow
there
the
fret
irish
for
doom
is
over
me
he
repeated
and
then
went
on
to
talk
once
more
of
god
and
heaven
more
than
once
also
he
said
waving
his
arm
towards
the
mountain
only
myself
knows
what
happened
under
the
forty
years
ago
and
as
he
said
it
the
tears
upon
his
face
glistened
in
the
moonlight
this
old
man
always
rises
before
me
when
i
think
of
x
both
seek
one
in
wandering
sentences
the
other
in
symbolic
pictures
and
subtle
allegoric
express
a
something
that
lies
beyond
the
range
of
expression
and
both
if
x
will
forgive
me
have
within
them
the
vast
and
vague
extravagance
that
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
celtic
heart
the
peasant
visionaries
that
are
the
landlord
duelists
that
were
and
the
whole
of
legends
cuchulain
fighting
the
sea
for
two
days
until
the
waves
pass
over
him
and
he
dies
caolte
storming
the
palace
of
the
gods
oisin
seeking
in
vain
for
three
hundred
years
to
appease
his
insatiable
heart
with
all
the
pleasures
of
faeryland
these
two
mystics
walking
up
and
down
upon
the
mountains
uttering
the
central
dreams
of
their
souls
in
no
less
sentences
and
this
mind
that
finds
them
so
interesting
all
are
a
portion
of
that
great
celtic
phantasmagoria
whose
meaning
no
man
has
discovered
nor
any
angel
revealed
village
ghosts
in
the
great
cities
we
see
so
little
of
the
world
we
drift
into
our
minority
in
the
little
towns
and
villages
there
are
no
minorities
people
are
not
numerous
enough
you
must
see
the
world
there
perforce
every
man
is
himself
a
class
every
hour
carries
its
new
challenge
when
you
pass
the
inn
at
the
end
of
the
village
you
leave
your
favourite
whimsy
behind
you
for
you
will
meet
no
one
who
can
share
it
we
listen
to
eloquent
speaking
read
books
and
write
them
settle
all
the
affairs
of
the
universe
the
dumb
village
multitudes
pass
on
unchanging
the
feel
of
the
spade
in
the
hand
is
no
different
for
all
our
talk
good
seasons
and
bad
follow
each
other
as
of
old
the
dumb
multitudes
are
no
more
concerned
with
us
than
is
the
old
horse
peering
through
the
rusty
gate
of
the
village
pound
the
ancient
wrote
across
unexplored
regions
here
are
lions
across
the
villages
of
fishermen
and
turners
of
the
earth
so
different
are
these
from
us
we
can
write
but
one
line
that
is
certain
here
are
ghosts
my
ghosts
inhabit
the
village
of
h
in
leinster
history
has
in
no
manner
been
burdened
by
this
ancient
village
with
its
crooked
lanes
its
old
abbey
churchyard
full
of
long
grass
its
green
background
of
small
and
its
quay
where
lie
a
few
tarry
in
the
annals
of
entomology
it
is
well
known
for
a
small
bay
lies
westward
a
little
where
he
who
watches
night
after
night
may
see
a
certain
rare
moth
fluttering
along
the
edge
of
the
tide
just
at
the
end
of
evening
or
the
beginning
of
dawn
a
hundred
years
ago
it
was
carried
here
from
italy
by
smugglers
in
a
cargo
of
silks
and
laces
if
the
would
throw
down
his
net
and
go
hunting
for
ghost
tales
or
tales
of
the
faeries
and
children
of
lillith
he
would
have
need
for
far
less
patience
to
approach
the
village
at
night
a
timid
man
requires
great
strategy
a
man
was
once
heard
complaining
by
the
cross
of
jesus
how
shall
i
go
if
i
pass
by
the
hill
of
dunboy
old
captain
burney
may
look
out
on
me
if
i
go
round
by
the
water
and
up
by
the
steps
there
is
the
headless
one
and
another
on
the
quays
and
a
new
one
under
the
old
churchyard
wall
if
i
go
right
round
the
other
way
stewart
is
appearing
at
hillside
gate
and
the
devil
himself
is
in
the
hospital
lane
i
never
heard
which
spirit
he
braved
but
feel
sure
it
was
not
the
one
in
the
hospital
lane
in
cholera
times
a
shed
had
been
there
set
up
to
receive
patients
when
the
need
had
gone
by
it
was
pulled
down
but
ever
since
the
ground
where
it
stood
has
broken
out
in
ghosts
and
demons
and
faeries
there
is
a
farmer
at
h
paddy
b
by
man
of
great
strength
and
a
teetotaller
his
wife
and
musing
on
his
great
strength
often
wonder
what
he
would
do
if
he
drank
one
night
when
passing
through
the
hospital
lane
he
saw
what
he
supposed
at
first
to
be
a
tame
rabbit
after
a
little
he
found
that
it
was
a
white
cat
when
he
came
near
the
creature
slowly
began
to
swell
larger
and
larger
and
as
it
grew
he
felt
his
own
strength
ebbing
away
as
though
it
were
sucked
out
of
him
he
turned
and
ran
by
the
hospital
lane
goes
the
faeries
path
every
evening
they
travel
from
the
hill
to
the
sea
from
the
sea
to
the
hill
at
the
sea
end
of
their
path
stands
a
cottage
one
night
arbunathy
who
lived
there
left
her
door
open
as
she
was
expecting
her
son
her
husband
was
asleep
by
the
fire
a
tall
man
came
in
and
sat
beside
him
after
he
had
been
sitting
there
for
a
while
the
woman
said
in
the
name
of
god
who
are
you
he
got
up
and
went
out
saying
never
leave
the
door
open
at
this
hour
or
evil
may
come
to
you
she
woke
her
husband
and
told
him
one
of
the
good
people
has
been
with
us
said
he
probably
the
man
braved
stewart
at
hillside
gate
when
she
lived
she
was
the
wife
of
the
protestant
clergyman
her
ghost
was
never
known
to
harm
any
one
say
the
village
people
it
is
only
doing
a
penance
upon
the
earth
not
far
from
hillside
gate
where
she
haunted
appeared
for
a
short
time
a
much
more
remarkable
spirit
its
haunt
was
the
bogeen
a
green
lane
leading
from
the
western
end
of
the
village
i
quote
its
history
at
length
a
typical
village
tragedy
in
a
cottage
at
the
village
end
of
the
bogeen
lived
a
jim
montgomery
and
his
wife
they
had
several
children
he
was
a
little
dandy
and
came
of
a
higher
class
than
his
neighbours
his
wife
was
a
very
big
woman
her
husband
who
had
been
expelled
from
the
village
choir
for
drink
gave
her
a
beating
one
day
her
sister
heard
of
it
and
came
and
took
down
one
of
the
window
shutters
montgomery
was
neat
about
everything
and
had
shutters
on
the
outside
of
every
window
and
beat
him
with
it
being
big
and
strong
like
her
sister
he
threatened
to
prosecute
her
she
answered
that
she
would
break
every
bone
in
his
body
if
he
did
she
never
spoke
to
her
sister
again
because
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
beaten
by
so
small
a
man
jim
montgomery
grew
worse
and
worse
his
wife
soon
began
to
have
not
enough
to
eat
she
told
no
one
for
she
was
very
proud
often
too
she
would
have
no
fire
on
a
cold
night
if
any
neighbours
came
in
she
would
say
she
had
let
the
fire
out
because
she
was
just
going
to
bed
the
people
about
often
heard
her
husband
beating
her
but
she
never
told
any
one
she
got
very
thin
at
last
one
saturday
there
was
no
food
in
the
house
for
herself
and
the
children
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
went
to
the
priest
and
asked
him
for
some
money
he
gave
her
thirty
shillings
her
husband
met
her
and
took
the
money
and
beat
her
on
the
following
monday
she
got
very
w
and
sent
for
a
kelly
kelly
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
said
my
woman
you
are
dying
and
sent
for
the
priest
and
the
doctor
she
died
in
an
hour
after
her
death
as
montgomery
neglected
the
children
the
landlord
had
them
taken
to
the
workhouse
a
few
nights
after
they
had
gone
kelly
was
going
home
through
the
bogeen
when
the
ghost
of
montgomery
appeared
and
followed
her
it
did
not
leave
her
until
she
reached
her
own
house
she
told
the
priest
father
r
a
noted
antiquarian
and
could
not
get
him
to
believe
her
a
few
nights
afterwards
kelly
again
met
the
spirit
in
the
same
place
she
was
in
too
great
terror
to
go
the
whole
way
but
stopped
at
a
cottage
midway
and
asked
them
to
let
her
in
they
answered
they
were
going
to
bed
she
cried
out
in
the
name
of
god
let
me
in
or
i
will
break
open
the
door
they
opened
and
so
she
escaped
from
the
ghost
next
day
she
told
the
priest
again
this
time
he
believed
and
said
it
would
follow
her
until
she
spoke
to
it
she
met
the
spirit
a
third
time
in
the
bogeen
she
asked
what
kept
it
from
its
rest
the
spirit
said
that
its
children
must
be
taken
from
the
workhouse
for
none
of
its
relations
were
ever
there
before
and
that
three
masses
were
to
be
said
for
the
repose
of
its
soul
if
my
husband
does
not
believe
you
she
said
show
him
that
and
touched
kelly
wrist
with
three
fingers
the
places
where
they
touched
swelled
up
and
blackened
she
then
vanished
for
a
time
montgomery
would
not
believe
that
his
wife
had
appeared
she
would
not
show
herself
to
kelly
he
said
she
with
respectable
people
to
appear
to
he
was
convinced
by
the
three
marks
and
the
children
were
taken
from
the
workhouse
the
priest
said
the
masses
and
the
shade
must
have
been
at
rest
for
it
has
not
since
appeared
some
time
afterwards
jim
montgomery
died
in
the
workhouse
having
come
to
great
poverty
through
drink
i
know
some
who
believe
they
have
seen
the
headless
ghost
upon
the
quay
and
one
who
when
he
passes
the
old
cemetery
wall
at
night
sees
a
woman
with
white
borders
to
her
cap
fn
creep
out
and
follow
him
the
apparition
only
leaves
him
at
his
own
door
the
villagers
imagine
that
she
follows
him
to
avenge
some
wrong
i
will
haunt
you
when
i
die
is
a
favourite
threat
his
wife
was
once
to
death
by
what
she
considers
a
demon
in
the
shape
of
a
dog
fn
i
wonder
why
she
had
white
borders
to
her
cap
the
old
mayo
woman
who
has
told
me
so
many
tales
has
told
me
that
her
law
saw
a
woman
with
white
borders
to
her
cap
going
around
the
stacks
in
a
field
and
soon
after
he
got
a
hurt
and
he
died
in
six
months
these
are
a
few
of
the
spirits
the
more
domestic
of
their
tribe
gather
plentiful
as
swallows
under
southern
eaves
one
night
a
nolan
was
watching
by
her
dying
child
in
lane
suddenly
there
was
a
sound
of
knocking
heard
at
the
door
she
did
not
open
fearing
it
was
some
unhuman
thing
that
knocked
the
knocking
ceased
after
a
little
the
and
then
the
were
burst
open
and
closed
again
her
husband
went
to
see
what
was
wrong
he
found
both
doors
bolted
the
child
died
the
doors
were
again
opened
and
closed
as
before
then
nolan
remembered
that
she
had
forgotten
to
leave
window
or
door
open
as
the
custom
is
for
the
departure
of
the
soul
these
strange
openings
and
closings
and
knockings
were
warnings
and
reminders
from
the
spirits
who
attend
the
dying
the
house
ghost
is
usually
a
harmless
and
creature
it
is
put
up
with
as
long
as
possible
it
brings
good
luck
to
those
who
live
with
it
i
remember
two
children
who
slept
with
their
mother
and
sisters
and
brothers
in
one
small
room
in
the
room
was
also
a
ghost
they
sold
herrings
in
the
dublin
streets
and
did
not
mind
the
ghost
much
because
they
knew
they
would
always
sell
their
fish
easily
while
they
slept
in
the
room
i
have
some
acquaintance
among
the
of
western
villages
the
connaught
tales
are
very
different
from
those
of
leinster
these
h
spirits
have
a
gloomy
way
with
them
they
come
to
announce
a
death
to
fulfil
some
obligation
to
revenge
a
wrong
to
pay
their
bills
even
as
did
a
fisherman
daughter
the
other
day
and
then
hasten
to
their
rest
all
things
they
do
decently
and
in
order
it
is
demons
and
not
ghosts
that
transform
themselves
into
white
cats
or
black
dogs
the
people
who
tell
the
tales
are
poor
fishing
people
who
find
in
the
doings
of
the
ghosts
the
fascination
of
fear
in
the
western
tales
is
a
whimsical
grace
a
curious
extravagance
the
people
who
recount
them
live
in
the
most
wild
and
beautiful
scenery
under
a
sky
ever
loaded
and
fantastic
with
flying
clouds
they
are
farmers
and
labourers
who
do
a
little
fishing
now
and
then
they
do
not
fear
the
spirits
too
much
to
feel
an
artistic
and
humorous
pleasure
in
their
doings
the
ghosts
themselves
share
in
their
quaint
hilarity
in
one
western
town
on
whose
deserted
wharf
the
grass
grows
these
spirits
have
so
much
vigour
that
when
a
misbeliever
ventured
to
sleep
in
a
haunted
house
i
have
been
told
they
flung
him
through
the
window
and
his
bed
after
him
in
the
surrounding
villages
the
creatures
use
the
most
strange
disguises
a
dead
old
gentleman
robs
the
cabbages
of
his
own
garden
in
the
shape
of
a
large
rabbit
a
wicked
stayed
for
years
inside
the
plaster
of
a
cottage
wall
in
the
shape
of
a
snipe
making

was

down

out
of
the

eye
i
i
have
been
lately
to
a
little
group
of
houses
not
many
enough
to
be
called
a
village
in
the
barony
of
kiltartan
in
county
galway
whose
name
ballylee
is
known
through
all
the
west
of
ireland
there
is
the
old
square
castle
ballylee
inhabited
by
a
farmer
and
his
wife
and
a
cottage
where
their
daughter
and
their
live
and
a
little
mill
with
an
old
miller
and
old
throwing
green
shadows
upon
a
little
river
and
great
i
went
there
two
or
three
times
last
year
to
talk
to
the
miller
about
biddy
early
a
wise
woman
that
lived
in
clare
some
years
ago
and
about
her
saying
there
is
a
cure
for
all
evil
between
the
two
of
ballylee
and
to
find
out
from
him
or
another
whether
she
meant
the
moss
between
the
running
waters
or
some
other
herb
i
have
been
there
this
summer
and
i
shall
be
there
again
before
it
is
autumn
because
mary
hynes
a
beautiful
woman
whose
name
is
still
a
wonder
by
turf
fires
died
there
sixty
years
ago
for
our
feet
would
linger
where
beauty
has
lived
its
life
of
sorrow
to
make
us
understand
that
it
is
not
of
the
world
an
old
man
brought
me
a
little
way
from
the
mill
and
the
castle
and
down
a
long
narrow
boreen
that
was
nearly
lost
in
brambles
and
sloe
bushes
and
he
said
that
is
the
little
old
foundation
of
the
house
but
the
most
of
it
is
taken
for
building
walls
and
the
goats
have
ate
those
bushes
that
are
growing
over
it
till
they
got
cranky
and
they
wo
grow
any
more
they
say
she
was
the
handsomest
girl
in
ireland
her
skin
was
like
dribbled
snow
he
meant
driven
snow
perhaps
and
she
had
blushes
in
her
cheeks
she
had
five
handsome
brothers
but
all
are
gone
now
i
talked
to
him
about
a
poem
in
irish
raftery
a
famous
poet
made
about
her
and
how
it
said
there
is
a
strong
cellar
in
ballylee
he
said
the
strong
cellar
was
the
great
hole
where
the
river
sank
underground
and
he
brought
me
to
a
deep
pool
where
an
otter
hurried
away
under
a
grey
boulder
and
told
me
that
many
fish
came
up
out
of
the
dark
water
at
early
morning
to
taste
the
fresh
water
coming
down
from
the
hills
i
first
heard
of
the
poem
from
an
old
woman
who
fives
about
two
miles
further
up
the
river
and
who
remembers
raftery
and
mary
hynes
she
says
i
never
saw
anybody
so
handsome
as
she
was
and
i
never
will
till
i
die
and
that
he
was
nearly
blind
and
had
no
way
of
living
but
to
go
round
and
to
mark
some
house
to
go
to
and
then
all
the
neighbours
would
gather
to
hear
if
you
treated
him
well
he
praise
you
but
if
you
did
not
he
fault
you
in
irish
he
was
the
greatest
poet
in
ireland
and
he
make
a
song
about
that
bush
if
he
chanced
to
stand
under
it
there
was
a
bush
he
stood
under
from
the
rain
and
he
made
verses
praising
it
and
then
when
the
water
came
through
he
made
verses
dispraising
it
she
sang
the
poem
to
a
friend
and
to
myself
in
irish
and
every
word
was
audible
and
expressive
as
the
words
in
a
song
were
always
as
i
think
before
music
grew
too
proud
to
be
the
garment
of
words
flowing
and
changing
with
the
flowing
and
changing
of
their
energies
the
poem
is
not
as
natural
as
the
best
irish
poetry
of
the
last
century
for
the
thoughts
are
arranged
in
a
too
obviously
traditional
form
so
the
old
poor
man
who
made
it
has
to
speak
as
if
he
were
a
rich
farmer
offering
the
best
of
everything
to
the
woman
he
loves
but
it
has
naive
and
tender
phrases
the
friend
that
was
with
me
has
made
some
of
the
translation
but
some
of
it
has
been
made
by
the
country
people
themselves
i
think
it
has
more
of
the
simplicity
of
the
irish
verses
than
one
finds
in
most
translations
going
to
mass
by
the
will
of
god
the
day
came
wet
and
the
wind
rose
i
met
mary
hynes
at
the
cross
of
kiltartan
and
i
fell
in
love
with
her
then
and
there
i
spoke
to
her
kind
and
mannerly
as
by
report
was
her
own
way
and
she
said
raftery
my
mind
is
easy
you
may
come
to
ballylee
when
i
heard
her
offer
i
did
not
linger
when
her
talk
went
to
my
heart
my
heart
rose
we
had
only
to
go
across
the
three
fields
we
had
daylight
with
us
to
ballylee
the
table
was
laid
with
glasses
and
a
quart
measure
she
had
fair
hair
and
she
sitting
beside
me
and
she
said
drink
raftery
and
a
hundred
welcomes
there
is
a
strong
cellar
in
ballylee
o
star
of
light
and
o
sun
in
harvest
o
amber
hair
o
my
share
of
the
world
will
you
come
with
me
upon
sunday
till
we
agree
together
before
all
the
people
i
would
not
grudge
you
a
song
every
sunday
evening
punch
on
the
table
or
wine
if
you
would
drink
it
but
o
king
of
glory
dry
the
roads
before
me
till
i
find
the
way
to
ballylee
there
is
sweet
air
on
the
side
of
the
hill
when
you
are
looking
down
upon
ballylee
when
you
are
walking
in
the
valley
picking
nuts
and
blackberries
there
is
music
of
the
birds
in
it
and
music
of
the
sidhe
what
is
the
worth
of
greatness
till
you
have
the
light
of
the
flower
of
the
branch
that
is
by
your
side
there
is
no
god
to
deny
it
or
to
try
and
hide
it
she
is
the
sun
in
the
heavens
who
wounded
my
heart
there
was
no
part
of
ireland
i
did
not
travel
from
the
rivers
to
the
tops
of
the
mountains
to
the
edge
of
lough
greine
whose
mouth
is
hidden
and
i
saw
no
beauty
but
was
behind
hers
her
hair
was
shining
and
her
brows
were
shining
too
her
face
was
like
herself
her
mouth
pleasant
and
sweet
she
is
the
pride
and
i
give
her
the
branch
she
is
the
shining
flower
of
ballylee
it
is
mary
hynes
this
calm
and
easy
woman
has
beauty
in
her
mind
and
in
her
face
if
a
hundred
clerks
were
gathered
together
they
could
not
write
down
a
half
of
her
ways
an
old
weaver
whose
son
is
supposed
to
go
away
among
the
sidhe
the
faeries
at
night
says
mary
hynes
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
ever
made
my
mother
used
to
tell
me
about
her
for
she
be
at
every
hurling
and
wherever
she
was
she
was
dressed
in
white
as
many
as
eleven
men
asked
her
in
marriage
in
one
day
but
she
would
have
any
of
them
there
was
a
lot
of
men
up
beyond
kilbecanty
one
night
sitting
together
drinking
and
talking
of
her
and
one
of
them
got
up
and
set
out
to
go
to
ballylee
and
see
her
but
cloon
bog
was
open
then
and
when
he
came
to
it
he
fell
into
the
water
and
they
found
him
dead
there
in
the
morning
she
died
of
the
fever
that
was
before
the
famine
another
old
man
says
he
was
only
a
child
when
he
saw
her
but
he
remembered
that
the
strongest
man
that
was
among
us
one
john
madden
got
his
death
of
the
head
of
her
cold
he
got
crossing
rivers
in
the
to
get
to
ballylee
this
is
perhaps
the
man
the
other
remembered
for
tradition
gives
the
one
thing
many
shapes
there
is
an
old
woman
who
remembers
her
at
derrybrien
among
the
echtge
hills
a
vast
desolate
place
which
has
changed
little
since
the
old
poem
said
the
stag
upon
the
cold
summit
of
echtge
hears
the
cry
of
the
wolves
but
still
mindful
of
many
poems
and
of
the
dignity
of
ancient
speech
she
says
the
sun
and
the
moon
never
shone
on
anybody
so
handsome
and
her
skin
was
so
white
that
it
looked
blue
and
she
had
two
little
blushes
on
her
cheeks
and
an
old
wrinkled
woman
who
lives
close
by
ballylee
and
has
told
me
many
tales
of
the
sidhe
says
i
often
saw
mary
hynes
she
was
handsome
indeed
she
had
two
bunches
of
curls
beside
her
cheeks
and
they
were
the
colour
of
silver
i
saw
mary
molloy
that
was
drowned
in
the
river
beyond
and
mary
guthrie
that
was
in
ardrahan
but
she
took
the
sway
of
them
both
a
very
comely
creature
i
was
at
her
wake
too
she
had
seen
too
much
of
the
world
she
was
a
kind
creature
one
day
i
was
coming
home
through
that
field
beyond
and
i
was
tired
and
who
should
come
out
but
the
poisin
glegeal
the
shining
flower
and
she
gave
me
a
glass
of
new
milk
this
old
woman
meant
no
more
than
some
beautiful
bright
colour
by
the
colour
of
silver
for
though
i
knew
an
old
man
he
is
dead
now
who
thought
she
might
know
the
cure
for
all
the
evils
in
the
world
that
the
sidhe
knew
she
has
seen
too
little
gold
to
know
its
colour
but
a
man
by
the
shore
at
kinvara
who
is
too
young
to
remember
mary
hynes
says
everybody
says
there
is
no
one
at
all
to
be
seen
now
so
handsome
it
is
said
she
had
beautiful
hair
the
colour
of
gold
she
was
poor
but
her
clothes
every
day
were
the
same
as
sunday
she
had
such
neatness
and
if
she
went
to
any
kind
of
a
meeting
they
would
all
be
killing
one
another
for
a
sight
of
her
and
there
was
a
great
many
in
love
with
her
but
she
died
young
it
is
said
that
no
one
that
has
a
song
made
about
them
will
ever
live
long
those
who
are
much
admired
are
it
is
held
taken
by
the
sidhe
who
can
use
ungoverned
feeling
for
their
own
ends
so
that
a
father
as
an
old
herb
doctor
told
me
once
may
give
his
child
into
their
hands
or
a
husband
his
wife
the
admired
and
desired
are
only
safe
if
one
says
god
bless
them
when
one
eyes
are
upon
them
the
old
woman
that
sang
the
song
thinks
too
that
mary
hynes
was
taken
as
the
phrase
is
for
they
have
taken
many
that
are
not
handsome
and
why
would
they
not
take
her
and
people
came
from
all
parts
to
look
at
her
and
maybe
there
were
some
that
did
not
say
bless
her
an
old
man
who
lives
by
the
sea
at
duras
has
as
little
doubt
that
she
was
taken
for
there
are
some
living
yet
can
remember
her
coming
to
the
pattern
fn
there
beyond
and
she
was
said
to
be
the
handsomest
girl
in
ireland
she
died
young
because
the
gods
loved
her
for
the
sidhe
are
the
gods
and
it
may
be
that
the
old
saying
which
we
forget
to
understand
literally
meant
her
manner
of
death
in
old
times
these
poor
countrymen
and
countrywomen
in
their
beliefs
and
in
their
emotions
are
many
years
nearer
to
that
old
greek
world
that
set
beauty
beside
the
fountain
of
things
than
are
our
men
of
learning
she
had
seen
too
much
of
the
world
but
these
old
men
and
women
when
they
tell
of
her
blame
another
and
not
her
and
though
they
can
be
hard
they
grow
gentle
as
the
old
men
of
troy
grew
gentle
when
helen
passed
by
on
the
walls
fn
a
pattern
or
patron
is
a
festival
in
honour
of
a
saint
the
poet
who
helped
her
to
so
much
fame
has
himself
a
great
fame
throughout
the
west
of
ireland
some
think
that
raftery
was
half
blind
and
say
i
saw
raftery
a
dark
man
but
he
had
sight
enough
to
see
her
or
the
like
but
some
think
he
was
wholly
blind
as
he
may
have
been
at
the
end
of
his
life
fable
makes
all
things
perfect
in
their
kind
and
her
blind
people
must
never
look
on
the
world
and
the
sun
i
asked
a
man
i
met
one
day
when
i
was
looking
for
a
pool
na
mna
sidhe
where
women
of
faery
have
been
seen
bow
raftery
could
have
admired
mary
hynes
so
much
f
he
had
been
altogether
blind
he
said
i
think
raftery
was
altogether
blind
but
those
that
are
blind
have
a
way
of
seeing
things
and
have
the
power
to
know
more
and
to
feel
more
and
to
do
more
and
to
guess
more
than
those
that
have
their
sight
and
a
certain
wit
and
a
certain
wisdom
is
given
to
them
everybody
indeed
will
tell
you
that
he
was
very
wise
for
was
he
not
only
blind
but
a
poet
the
weaver
whose
words
about
mary
hynes
i
have
already
given
says
his
poetry
was
the
gift
of
the
almighty
for
there
are
three
things
that
are
the
gift
of
the
almighty
poetry
and
dancing
and
principles
that
is
why
in
the
old
times
an
ignorant
man
coming
down
from
the
hillside
would
be
better
behaved
and
have
better
learning
than
a
man
with
education
you
meet
now
for
they
got
it
from
god
and
a
man
at
coole
says
when
he
put
his
finger
to
one
part
of
his
head
everything
would
come
to
him
as
if
it
was
written
in
a
book
and
an
old
pensioner
at
kiltartan
says
he
was
standing
under
a
bush
one
time
and
he
talked
to
it
and
it
answered
him
back
in
irish
some
say
it
was
the
bush
that
spoke
but
it
must
have
been
an
enchanted
voice
in
it
and
it
gave
him
the
knowledge
of
all
the
things
of
the
world
the
bush
withered
up
afterwards
and
it
is
to
be
seen
on
the
roadside
now
between
this
and
rahasine
there
is
a
poem
of
his
about
a
bush
which
i
have
never
seen
and
it
may
have
come
out
of
the
cauldron
of
fable
in
this
shape
a
friend
of
mine
met
a
man
once
who
had
been
with
him
when
he
died
but
the
people
say
that
he
died
alone
and
one
maurteen
gillane
told
hyde
that
all
night
long
a
light
was
seen
streaming
up
to
heaven
from
the
roof
of
the
house
where
he
lay
and
that
was
the
angels
who
were
with
him
and
all
night
long
there
was
a
great
light
in
the
hovel
and
that
was
the
angels
who
were
waking
him
they
gave
that
honour
to
him
because
he
was
so
good
a
poet
and
sang
such
religious
songs
it
may
be
that
in
a
few
years
fable
who
changes
mortalities
to
immortalities
in
her
cauldron
will
have
changed
mary
hynes
and
raftery
to
perfect
symbols
of
the
sorrow
of
beauty
and
of
the
magnificence
and
penury
of
dreams
ii
when
i
was
in
a
northern
town
awhile
ago
i
had
a
long
talk
with
a
man
who
had
lived
in
a
neighbouring
country
district
when
he
was
a
boy
he
told
me
that
when
a
very
beautiful
girl
was
born
in
a
family
that
had
not
been
noted
for
good
looks
her
beauty
was
thought
to
have
come
from
the
sidhe
and
to
bring
misfortune
with
it
he
went
over
the
names
of
several
beautiful
girls
that
he
had
known
and
said
that
beauty
had
never
brought
happiness
to
anybody
it
was
a
thing
he
said
to
be
proud
of
and
afraid
of
i
wish
i
had
written
out
his
words
at
the
time
for
they
were
more
picturesque
than
my
memory
of
them
a
knight
of
the
sheep
away
to
the
north
of
ben
bulben
and
cope
mountain
lives
a
strong
farmer
a
knight
of
the
sheep
they
would
have
called
him
in
the
gaelic
days
proud
of
his
descent
from
one
of
the
most
fighting
clans
of
the
middle
ages
he
is
a
man
of
force
alike
in
his
words
and
in
his
deeds
there
is
but
one
man
that
swears
like
him
and
this
man
lives
far
away
upon
the
mountain
father
in
heaven
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
this
he
says
when
he
has
lost
his
pipe
and
no
man
but
he
who
lives
on
the
mountain
can
rival
his
language
on
a
fair
day
over
a
bargain
he
is
passionate
and
abrupt
in
his
movements
and
when
angry
tosses
his
white
beard
about
with
his
left
hand
one
day
i
was
dining
with
him
when
the
announced
a
certain
a
sudden
silence
fell
upon
the
old
man
and
upon
his
two
daughters
at
last
the
eldest
daughter
said
somewhat
severely
to
her
father
go
and
ask
him
to
come
in
and
dine
the
old
man
went
out
and
then
came
in
looking
greatly
relieved
and
said
he
says
he
will
not
dine
with
us
go
out
said
the
daughter
and
ask
him
into
the
back
parlour
and
give
him
some
whiskey
her
father
who
had
just
finished
his
dinner
obeyed
sullenly
and
i
heard
the
door
of
the
back
parlour
a
little
room
where
the
daughters
sat
and
sewed
during
the
evening
shut
to
behind
the
men
the
daughter
then
turned
to
me
and
said
is
the
and
last
year
he
raised
our
taxes
and
my
father
was
very
angry
and
when
he
came
brought
him
into
the
dairy
and
sent
the
away
on
a
message
and
then
swore
at
him
a
great
deal
will
teach
you
sir
replied
the
law
can
protect
its
officers
but
my
father
reminded
him
that
he
had
no
witness
at
last
my
father
got
tired
and
sorry
too
and
said
he
would
show
him
a
short
way
home
when
they
were
to
the
main
road
they
came
on
a
man
of
my
father
who
was
ploughing
and
this
somehow
brought
back
remembrance
of
the
wrong
he
sent
the
man
away
on
a
message
and
began
to
swear
at
the
again
when
i
heard
of
it
i
was
disgusted
that
he
should
have
made
such
a
fuss
over
a
miserable
creature
like
and
when
i
heard
a
few
weeks
ago
that
only
son
had
died
and
left
him
i
resolved
to
make
my
father
be
kind
to
him
next
time
he
came
she
then
went
out
to
see
a
neighbour
and
i
sauntered
towards
the
back
parlour
when
i
came
to
the
door
i
heard
angry
voices
inside
the
two
men
were
evidently
getting
on
to
the
tax
again
for
i
could
hear
them
bandying
figures
to
and
fro
i
opened
the
door
at
sight
of
my
face
the
farmer
was
reminded
of
his
peaceful
intentions
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
where
the
whiskey
was
i
had
seen
him
put
it
into
the
cupboard
and
was
able
therefore
to
find
it
and
get
it
out
looking
at
the
thin
struck
face
of
the
he
was
rather
older
than
my
friend
and
very
much
more
feeble
and
worn
and
of
a
very
different
type
he
was
not
like
him
a
robust
successful
man
but
rather
one
of
those
whose
feet
find
no
upon
the
earth
i
recognized
one
of
the
children
of
reverie
and
said
you
are
doubtless
of
the
stock
of
the
old
i
know
well
the
hole
in
the
river
where
their
treasure
lies
buried
under
the
guard
of
a
serpent
with
many
heads
yes
sur
he
replied
i
am
the
last
of
a
line
of
princes
we
then
fell
to
talking
of
many
commonplace
things
and
my
friend
did
not
once
toss
up
his
beard
but
was
very
friendly
at
last
the
gaunt
old
got
up
to
go
and
my
friend
said
i
hope
we
will
have
a
glass
together
next
year
no
no
was
the
answer
i
shall
be
dead
next
year
i
too
have
lost
sons
said
the
other
in
quite
a
gentle
voice
but
your
sons
were
not
like
my
son
and
then
the
two
men
parted
with
an
angry
flush
and
bitter
hearts
and
had
i
not
cast
between
them
some
common
words
or
other
might
not
have
parted
but
have
fallen
rather
into
an
angry
discussion
of
the
value
of
their
dead
sons
if
i
had
not
pity
for
all
the
children
of
reverie
i
should
have
let
them
fight
it
out
and
would
now
have
many
a
wonderful
oath
to
record
the
knight
of
the
sheep
would
have
had
the
victory
for
no
soul
that
wears
this
garment
of
blood
and
clay
can
surpass
him
he
was
but
once
beaten
and
this
is
his
tale
of
how
it
was
he
and
some
farm
hands
were
playing
at
cards
in
a
small
cabin
that
stood
against
the
end
of
a
big
barn
a
wicked
woman
had
once
lived
in
this
cabin
suddenly
one
of
the
players
threw
down
an
ace
and
began
to
swear
without
any
cause
his
swearing
was
so
dreadful
that
the
others
stood
up
and
my
friend
said
all
is
not
right
here
there
is
a
spirit
in
him
they
ran
to
the
door
that
led
into
the
barn
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
the
wooden
bolt
would
not
move
so
the
knight
of
the
sheep
took
a
saw
which
stood
against
the
wall
near
at
hand
and
sawed
through
the
bolt
and
at
once
the
door
flew
open
with
a
bang
as
though
some
one
had
been
holding
it
and
they
fled
through
an
enduring
heart
one
day
a
friend
of
mine
was
making
a
sketch
of
my
knight
of
the
sheep
the
old
man
daughter
was
sitting
by
and
when
the
conversation
drifted
to
love
and
lovemaking
she
said
oh
father
tell
him
about
your
love
affair
the
old
man
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
said
nobody
ever
marries
the
woman
he
loves
and
then
with
a
chuckle
there
were
fifteen
of
them
i
liked
better
than
the
woman
i
married
and
he
repeated
many
women
names
he
went
on
to
tell
how
when
he
was
a
lad
he
had
worked
for
his
grandfather
his
mother
father
and
was
called
my
friend
has
forgotten
why
by
his
grandfather
name
which
we
will
say
was
doran
he
had
a
great
friend
whom
i
shall
call
john
byrne
and
one
day
he
and
his
friend
went
to
queenstown
to
await
an
emigrant
ship
that
was
to
take
john
byrne
to
america
when
they
were
walking
along
the
quay
they
saw
a
girl
sitting
on
a
seat
crying
miserably
and
two
men
standing
up
in
front
of
her
quarrelling
with
one
another
doran
said
i
think
i
know
what
is
wrong
that
man
will
be
her
brother
and
that
man
will
be
her
lover
and
the
brother
is
sending
her
to
america
to
get
her
away
from
the
lover
how
she
is
crying
but
i
think
i
could
console
her
myself
presently
the
lover
and
brother
went
away
and
doran
began
to
walk
up
and
down
before
her
saying
mild
weather
miss
or
the
like
she
answered
him
in
a
little
while
and
the
three
began
to
talk
together
the
emigrant
ship
did
not
arrive
for
some
days
and
the
three
drove
about
on
outside
cars
very
innocently
and
happily
seeing
everything
that
was
to
be
seen
when
at
last
the
ship
came
and
doran
had
to
break
it
to
her
that
he
was
not
going
to
america
she
cried
more
after
him
than
after
the
first
lover
doran
whispered
to
byrne
as
he
went
aboard
ship
now
byrne
i
do
grudge
her
to
you
but
do
marry
young
when
the
story
got
to
this
the
farmer
daughter
joined
in
mockingly
with
i
suppose
you
said
that
for
byrne
good
father
but
the
old
man
insisted
that
he
had
said
it
for
byrne
good
and
went
on
to
tell
how
when
he
got
a
letter
telling
of
byrne
engagement
to
the
girl
he
wrote
him
the
same
advice
years
passed
by
and
he
heard
nothing
and
though
he
was
now
married
he
could
not
keep
from
wondering
what
she
was
doing
at
last
he
went
to
america
to
find
out
and
though
he
asked
many
people
for
tidings
he
could
get
none
more
years
went
by
and
his
wife
was
dead
and
he
well
on
in
years
and
a
rich
farmer
with
not
a
few
great
matters
on
his
hands
he
found
an
excuse
in
some
vague
business
to
go
out
to
america
again
and
to
begin
his
search
again
one
day
he
fell
into
talk
with
an
irishman
in
a
railway
carriage
and
asked
him
as
his
way
was
about
emigrants
from
this
place
and
that
and
at
last
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
miller
daughter
from
innis
rath
and
he
named
the
woman
he
was
looking
for
oh
yes
said
the
other
she
is
married
to
a
friend
of
mine
john
macewing
she
lives
at
such
a
street
in
chicago
doran
went
to
chicago
and
knocked
at
her
door
she
opened
the
door
herself
and
was
not
a
bit
changed
he
gave
her
his
real
name
which
he
had
taken
again
after
his
death
and
the
name
of
the
man
he
had
met
in
the
train
she
did
not
recognize
him
but
asked
him
to
stay
to
dinner
saying
that
her
husband
would
be
glad
to
meet
anybody
who
knew
that
old
friend
of
his
they
talked
of
many
things
but
for
all
their
talk
i
do
not
know
why
and
perhaps
he
did
not
know
why
he
never
told
her
who
he
was
at
dinner
he
asked
her
about
byrne
and
she
put
her
head
down
on
the
table
and
began
to
cry
and
she
cried
so
he
was
afraid
her
husband
might
be
angry
he
was
afraid
to
ask
what
had
happened
to
byrne
and
left
soon
after
never
to
see
her
again
when
the
old
man
had
finished
the
story
he
said
tell
that
to
yeats
he
will
make
a
poem
about
it
perhaps
but
the
daughter
said
oh
no
father
nobody
could
make
a
poem
about
a
woman
like
that
alas
i
have
never
made
the
poem
perhaps
because
my
own
heart
which
has
loved
helen
and
all
the
lovely
and
fickle
women
of
the
world
would
be
too
sore
there
are
things
it
is
well
not
to
ponder
over
too
much
things
that
bare
words
are
the
best
suited
for
the
sorcerers
in
ireland
we
hear
but
little
of
the
darker
powers
fn
and
come
across
any
who
have
seen
them
even
more
rarely
for
the
imagination
of
the
people
dwells
rather
upon
the
fantastic
and
capricious
and
fantasy
and
caprice
would
lose
the
freedom
which
is
their
breath
of
life
were
they
to
unite
them
either
with
evil
or
with
good
and
yet
the
wise
are
of
opinion
that
wherever
man
is
the
dark
powers
who
would
feed
his
rapacities
are
there
too
no
less
than
the
bright
beings
who
store
their
honey
in
the
cells
of
his
heart
and
the
twilight
beings
who
flit
hither
and
thither
and
that
they
encompass
him
with
a
passionate
and
melancholy
multitude
they
hold
too
that
he
who
by
long
desire
or
through
accident
of
birth
possesses
the
power
of
piercing
into
their
hidden
abode
can
see
them
there
those
who
were
once
men
or
women
full
of
a
terrible
vehemence
and
those
who
have
never
lived
upon
the
earth
moving
slowly
and
with
a
subtler
malice
the
dark
powers
cling
about
us
it
is
said
day
and
night
like
bats
upon
an
old
tree
and
that
we
do
not
hear
more
of
them
is
merely
because
the
darker
kinds
of
magic
have
been
but
little
practised
i
have
indeed
come
across
very
few
persons
in
ireland
who
try
to
communicate
with
evil
powers
and
the
few
i
have
met
keep
their
purpose
and
practice
wholly
hidden
from
those
among
whom
they
live
they
are
mainly
small
clerks
and
the
like
and
meet
for
the
purpose
of
their
art
in
a
room
hung
with
black
hangings
they
would
not
admit
me
into
this
room
but
finding
me
not
altogether
ignorant
of
the
arcane
science
showed
gladly
elsewhere
what
they
would
do
come
to
us
said
their
leader
a
clerk
in
a
large
and
we
will
show
you
spirits
who
will
talk
to
you
face
to
face
and
in
shapes
as
solid
and
heavy
as
our
own
fn
i
know
better
now
we
have
the
dark
powers
much
more
than
i
thought
but
not
as
much
as
the
scottish
and
yet
i
think
the
imagination
of
the
people
does
dwell
chiefly
upon
the
fantastic
and
capricious
i
had
been
talking
of
the
power
of
communicating
in
states
of
trance
with
the
angelical
and
faery
beings
the
children
of
the
day
and
of
the
twilight
and
he
had
been
contending
that
we
should
only
believe
in
what
we
can
see
and
feel
when
in
our
ordinary
everyday
state
of
mind
yes
i
said
i
will
come
to
you
or
some
such
words
but
i
will
not
permit
myself
to
become
entranced
and
will
therefore
know
whether
these
shapes
you
talk
of
are
any
the
more
to
be
touched
and
felt
by
the
ordinary
senses
than
are
those
i
talk
of
i
was
not
denying
the
power
of
other
beings
to
take
upon
themselves
a
clothing
of
mortal
substance
but
only
that
simple
invocations
such
as
he
spoke
of
seemed
unlikely
to
do
more
than
cast
the
mind
into
trance
and
thereby
bring
it
into
the
presence
of
the
powers
of
day
twilight
and
darkness
but
he
said
we
have
seen
them
move
the
furniture
hither
and
thither
and
they
go
at
our
bidding
and
help
or
harm
people
who
know
nothing
of
them
i
am
not
giving
the
exact
words
but
as
accurately
as
i
can
the
substance
of
our
talk
on
the
night
arranged
i
turned
up
about
eight
and
found
the
leader
sitting
alone
in
almost
total
darkness
in
a
small
back
room
he
was
dressed
in
a
black
gown
like
an
inquisitor
dress
in
an
old
drawing
that
left
nothing
of
him
visible
except
his
eyes
which
peered
out
through
two
small
round
holes
upon
the
table
in
front
of
him
was
a
brass
dish
of
burning
herbs
a
large
bowl
a
skull
covered
with
painted
symbols
two
crossed
daggers
and
certain
implements
shaped
like
quern
stones
which
were
used
to
control
the
elemental
powers
in
some
fashion
i
did
not
discover
i
also
put
on
a
black
gown
and
remember
that
it
did
not
fit
perfectly
and
that
it
interfered
with
my
movements
considerably
the
sorcerer
then
took
a
black
cock
out
of
a
basket
and
cut
its
throat
with
one
of
the
daggers
letting
the
blood
fall
into
the
large
bowl
he
opened
a
book
and
began
an
invocation
which
was
certainly
not
english
and
had
a
deep
guttural
sound
before
he
had
finished
another
of
the
sorcerers
a
man
of
about
came
in
and
having
put
on
a
black
gown
also
seated
himself
at
my
left
band
i
had
the
invoker
directly
in
front
of
me
and
soon
began
to
find
his
eyes
which
glittered
through
the
small
holes
in
his
hood
affecting
me
in
a
curious
way
i
struggled
hard
against
their
influence
and
my
head
began
to
ache
the
invocation
continued
and
nothing
happened
for
the
first
few
minutes
then
the
invoker
got
up
and
extinguished
the
light
in
the
hall
so
that
no
glimmer
might
come
through
the
slit
under
the
door
there
was
now
no
light
except
from
the
herbs
on
the
brass
dish
and
no
sound
except
from
the
deep
guttural
murmur
of
the
invocation
presently
the
man
at
my
left
swayed
himself
about
and
cried
out
o
god
o
god
i
asked
him
what
ailed
him
but
he
did
not
know
he
had
spoken
a
moment
after
he
said
he
could
see
a
great
serpent
moving
about
the
room
and
became
considerably
excited
i
saw
nothing
with
any
definite
shape
but
thought
that
black
clouds
were
forming
about
me
i
felt
i
must
fall
into
a
trance
if
i
did
not
struggle
against
it
and
that
the
influence
which
was
causing
this
trance
was
out
of
harmony
with
itself
in
other
words
evil
after
a
struggle
i
got
rid
of
the
black
clouds
and
was
able
to
observe
with
my
ordinary
senses
again
the
two
sorcerers
now
began
to
see
black
and
white
columns
moving
about
the
room
and
finally
a
man
in
a
monk
habit
and
they
became
greatly
puzzled
because
i
did
not
see
these
things
also
for
to
them
they
were
as
solid
as
the
table
before
them
the
invoker
appeared
to
be
gradually
increasing
in
power
and
i
began
to
feel
as
if
a
tide
of
darkness
was
pouring
from
him
and
concentrating
itself
about
me
and
now
too
i
noticed
that
the
man
on
my
left
hand
had
passed
into
a
trance
with
a
last
great
effort
i
drove
off
the
black
clouds
but
feeling
them
to
be
the
only
shapes
i
should
see
without
passing
into
a
trance
and
having
no
great
love
for
them
i
asked
for
lights
and
after
the
needful
exorcism
returned
to
the
ordinary
world
i
said
to
the
more
powerful
of
the
two
sorcerers
what
would
happen
if
one
of
your
spirits
had
overpowered
me
you
would
go
out
of
this
room
he
answered
with
his
character
added
to
your
own
i
asked
about
the
origin
of
his
sorcery
but
got
little
of
importance
except
that
he
had
learned
it
from
his
father
he
would
not
tell
me
more
for
he
had
it
appeared
taken
a
vow
of
secrecy
for
some
days
i
could
not
get
over
the
feeling
of
having
a
number
of
deformed
and
grotesque
figures
lingering
about
me
the
bright
powers
are
always
beautiful
and
desirable
and
the
dim
powers
are
now
beautiful
now
quaintly
grotesque
but
the
dark
powers
express
their
unbalanced
natures
in
shapes
of
ugliness
and
horror
the
devil
my
old
mayo
woman
told
me
one
day
that
something
very
bad
had
come
down
the
road
and
gone
into
the
house
opposite
and
though
she
would
not
say
what
it
was
i
knew
quite
well
another
day
she
told
me
of
two
friends
of
hers
who
had
been
made
love
to
by
one
whom
they
believed
to
be
the
devil
one
of
them
was
standing
by
the
when
he
came
by
on
horseback
and
asked
her
to
mount
up
behind
him
and
go
riding
when
she
would
not
he
vanished
the
other
was
out
on
the
road
late
at
night
waiting
for
her
young
man
when
something
came
flapping
and
rolling
along
the
road
up
to
her
feet
it
had
the
likeness
of
a
newspaper
and
presently
it
flapped
up
into
her
face
and
she
knew
by
the
size
of
it
that
it
was
the
irish
times
all
of
a
sudden
it
changed
into
a
young
man
who
asked
her
to
go
walking
with
him
she
would
not
and
he
vanished
i
know
of
an
old
man
too
on
the
slopes
of
ben
bulben
who
found
the
devil
ringing
a
bell
under
his
bed
and
he
went
off
and
stole
the
chapel
bell
and
rang
him
out
it
may
be
that
this
like
the
others
was
not
the
devil
at
all
but
some
poor
wood
spirit
whose
cloven
feet
had
got
him
into
trouble
happy
and
unhappy
theologians
i
a
mayo
woman
once
said
to
me
i
knew
a
servant
girl
who
hung
herself
for
the
love
of
god
she
was
lonely
for
the
priest
and
her
society
fn
and
hung
herself
to
the
banisters
with
a
scarf
she
was
no
sooner
dead
than
she
became
white
as
a
lily
and
if
it
had
been
murder
or
suicide
she
would
have
become
black
as
black
they
gave
her
christian
burial
and
the
priest
said
she
was
no
sooner
dead
than
she
was
with
the
lord
so
nothing
matters
that
you
do
for
the
love
of
god
i
do
not
wonder
at
the
pleasure
she
has
in
telling
this
story
for
she
herself
loves
all
holy
things
with
an
ardour
that
brings
them
quickly
to
her
lips
she
told
me
once
that
she
never
hears
anything
described
in
a
sermon
that
she
does
not
afterwards
see
with
her
eyes
she
has
described
to
me
the
gates
of
purgatory
as
they
showed
themselves
to
her
eyes
but
i
remember
nothing
of
the
description
except
that
she
could
not
see
the
souls
in
trouble
but
only
the
gates
her
mind
continually
dwells
on
what
is
pleasant
and
beautiful
one
day
she
asked
me
what
month
and
what
flower
were
the
most
beautiful
when
i
answered
that
i
did
not
know
she
said
the
month
of
may
because
of
the
virgin
and
the
lily
of
the
valley
because
it
never
sinned
but
came
pure
out
of
the
rocks
and
then
she
asked
what
is
the
cause
of
the
three
cold
months
of
winter
i
did
not
know
even
that
and
so
she
said
the
sin
of
man
and
the
vengeance
of
god
christ
himself
was
not
only
blessed
but
perfect
in
all
manly
proportions
in
her
eyes
so
much
do
beauty
and
holiness
go
together
in
her
thoughts
he
alone
of
all
men
was
exactly
six
feet
high
all
others
are
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
fn
the
religious
society
she
had
belonged
to
her
thoughts
and
her
sights
of
the
people
of
faery
are
pleasant
and
beautiful
too
and
i
have
never
heard
her
call
them
the
fallen
angels
they
are
people
like
ourselves
only
and
many
and
many
a
time
she
has
gone
to
the
window
to
watch
them
drive
their
waggons
through
the
sky
waggon
behind
waggon
in
long
line
or
to
the
door
to
hear
them
singing
and
dancing
in
the
forth
they
sing
chiefly
it
seems
a
song
called
the
distant
waterfall
and
though
they
once
knocked
her
down
she
never
thinks
badly
of
them
she
saw
them
most
easily
when
she
was
in
service
in
king
county
and
one
morning
a
little
while
ago
she
said
to
me
last
night
i
was
waiting
up
for
the
master
and
it
was
a
eleven
i
heard
a
bang
right
down
on
the
table
county
all
over
says
i
and
i
laughed
till
i
was
near
dead
it
was
a
warning
i
was
staying
too
long
they
wanted
the
place
to
themselves
i
told
her
once
of
somebody
who
saw
a
faery
and
fainted
and
she
said
it
could
not
have
been
a
faery
but
some
bad
thing
nobody
could
faint
at
a
faery
it
was
a
demon
i
was
not
afraid
when
they
near
put
me
and
the
bed
under
me
out
through
the
roof
i
was
afraid
either
when
you
were
at
some
work
and
i
heard
a
thing
coming
up
the
stairs
like
an
eel
and
squealing
it
went
to
all
the
doors
it
could
not
get
in
where
i
was
i
would
have
sent
it
through
the
universe
like
a
flash
of
fire
there
was
a
man
in
my
place
a
tearing
fellow
and
he
put
one
of
them
down
he
went
out
to
meet
it
on
the
road
but
he
must
have
been
told
the
words
but
the
faeries
are
the
best
neighbours
if
you
do
good
to
them
they
will
do
good
to
you
but
they
do
like
you
to
be
on
their
path
another
time
she
said
to
me
they
are
always
good
to
the
poor
ii
there
is
however
a
man
in
a
galway
village
who
can
see
nothing
but
wickedness
some
think
him
very
holy
and
others
think
him
a
little
crazed
but
some
of
his
talk
reminds
one
of
those
old
irish
visions
of
the
three
worlds
which
are
supposed
to
have
given
dante
the
plan
of
the
divine
comedy
but
i
could
not
imagine
this
man
seeing
paradise
he
is
especially
angry
with
the
people
of
faery
and
describes
the
like
feet
that
are
so
common
among
them
who
are
indeed
children
of
pan
to
prove
them
children
of
satan
he
will
not
grant
that
they
carry
away
women
though
there
are
many
that
say
so
but
he
is
certain
that
they
are
as
thick
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
about
us
and
they
tempt
poor
mortals
he
says
there
is
a
priest
i
know
of
was
looking
along
the
ground
like
as
if
he
was
hunting
for
something
and
a
voice
said
to
him
you
want
to
see
them
you
see
enough
of
them
and
his
eyes
were
opened
and
he
saw
the
ground
thick
with
them
singing
they
do
be
sometimes
and
dancing
but
all
the
time
they
have
cloven
feet
yet
he
was
so
scornful
of
unchristian
things
for
all
their
dancing
and
singing
that
he
thinks
that
you
have
only
to
bid
them
begone
and
they
will
go
it
was
one
night
he
says
after
walking
back
from
kinvara
and
down
by
the
wood
beyond
i
felt
one
coming
beside
me
and
i
could
feel
the
horse
he
was
riding
on
and
the
way
he
lifted
his
legs
but
they
do
not
make
a
sound
like
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
so
i
stopped
and
turned
around
and
said
very
loud
off
and
he
went
and
never
troubled
me
after
and
i
knew
a
man
who
was
dying
and
one
came
on
his
bed
and
he
cried
out
to
it
out
of
that
you
unnatural
animal
and
it
left
him
fallen
angels
they
are
and
after
the
fall
god
said
there
be
hell
and
there
it
was
in
a
moment
an
old
woman
who
was
sitting
by
the
fire
joined
in
as
he
said
this
with
god
save
us
it
a
pity
he
said
the
word
and
there
might
have
been
no
hell
the
day
but
the
seer
did
not
notice
her
words
he
went
on
and
then
he
asked
the
devil
what
would
he
take
for
the
souls
of
all
the
people
and
the
devil
said
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
the
blood
of
a
virgin
son
so
he
got
that
and
then
the
gates
of
hell
were
opened
he
understood
the
story
it
seems
as
if
it
were
some
riddling
old
folk
tale
i
have
seen
hell
myself
i
had
a
sight
of
it
one
time
in
a
vision
it
had
a
very
high
wall
around
it
all
of
metal
and
an
archway
and
a
straight
walk
into
it
just
like
what
be
leading
into
a
orchard
but
the
edges
were
not
trimmed
with
box
but
with
metal
and
inside
the
wall
there
were
and
i
not
sure
what
there
was
to
the
right
but
to
the
left
there
were
five
great
furnaces
and
they
full
of
souls
kept
there
with
great
chains
so
i
turned
short
and
went
away
and
in
turning
i
looked
again
at
the
wall
and
i
could
see
no
end
to
it
and
another
time
i
saw
purgatory
it
seemed
to
be
in
a
level
place
and
no
walls
around
it
but
it
all
one
bright
blaze
and
the
souls
standing
in
it
and
they
suffer
near
as
much
as
in
hell
only
there
are
no
devils
with
them
there
and
they
have
the
hope
of
heaven
and
i
heard
a
call
to
me
from
there
me
to
come
out
o
this
and
when
i
looked
it
was
a
man
i
used
to
know
in
the
army
an
irishman
and
from
this
county
and
i
believe
him
to
be
a
descendant
of
king
of
athenry
so
i
stretched
out
my
hand
first
but
then
i
called
out
be
burned
in
the
flames
before
i
could
get
within
three
yards
of
you
so
then
he
said
help
me
with
your
prayers
and
so
i
do
and
father
connellan
says
the
same
thing
to
help
the
dead
with
your
prayers
and
he
a
very
clever
man
to
make
a
sermon
and
has
a
great
deal
of
cures
made
with
the
holy
water
he
brought
back
from
lourdes
the
last
gleeman
michael
moran
was
born
about
off
black
pitts
in
the
liberties
of
dublin
in
faddle
alley
a
fortnight
after
birth
he
went
stone
blind
from
illness
and
became
thereby
a
blessing
to
his
parents
who
were
soon
able
to
send
him
to
rhyme
and
beg
at
street
corners
and
at
the
bridges
over
the
liffey
they
may
well
have
wished
that
their
quiver
were
full
of
such
as
he
for
free
from
the
interruption
of
sight
his
mind
became
a
perfect
echoing
chamber
where
every
movement
of
the
day
and
every
change
of
public
passion
whispered
itself
into
rhyme
or
quaint
saying
by
the
time
he
had
grown
to
manhood
he
was
the
admitted
rector
of
all
the
of
the
liberties
madden
the
weaver
kearney
the
blind
fiddler
from
wicklow
martin
from
meath
from
heaven
knows
where
and
that
who
in
after
days
when
the
true
moran
was
no
more
strutted
in
borrowed
plumes
or
rather
in
borrowed
rags
and
gave
out
that
there
had
never
been
any
moran
but
himself
and
many
another
did
homage
before
him
and
held
him
chief
of
all
their
tribe
nor
despite
his
blindness
did
he
find
any
difficulty
in
getting
a
wife
but
rather
was
able
to
pick
and
choose
for
he
was
just
that
mixture
of
ragamuffin
and
of
genius
which
is
dear
to
the
heart
of
woman
who
perhaps
because
she
is
wholly
conventional
herself
loves
the
unexpected
the
crooked
the
bewildering
nor
did
he
lack
despite
his
rags
many
excellent
things
for
it
is
remembered
that
he
ever
loved
caper
sauce
going
so
far
indeed
in
his
honest
indignation
at
its
absence
upon
one
occasion
as
to
fling
a
leg
of
mutton
at
his
wife
he
was
not
however
much
to
look
at
with
his
coarse
frieze
coat
with
its
cape
and
scalloped
edge
his
old
corduroy
trousers
and
great
brogues
and
his
stout
stick
made
fast
to
his
wrist
by
a
thong
of
leather
and
he
would
have
been
a
woeful
shock
to
the
gleeman
macconglinne
could
that
friend
of
kings
have
beheld
him
in
prophetic
vision
from
the
pillar
stone
at
cork
and
yet
though
the
short
cloak
and
the
leather
wallet
were
no
more
he
was
a
true
gleeman
being
alike
poet
jester
and
newsman
of
the
people
in
the
morning
when
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
his
wife
or
some
neighbour
would
read
the
newspaper
to
him
and
read
on
and
on
until
he
interrupted
with
that
do
i
have
me
meditations
and
from
these
meditations
would
come
the
day
store
of
jest
and
rhyme
he
had
the
whole
middle
ages
under
his
frieze
coat
he
had
not
however
macconglinne
hatred
of
the
church
and
clergy
for
when
the
fruit
of
his
meditations
did
not
ripen
well
or
when
the
crowd
called
for
something
more
solid
he
would
recite
or
sing
a
metrical
tale
or
ballad
of
saint
or
martyr
or
of
biblical
adventure
he
would
stand
at
a
street
comer
and
when
a
crowd
had
gathered
would
begin
in
some
such
fashion
as
follows
i
copy
the
record
of
one
who
knew
him
gather
round
me
boys
gather
round
me
boys

in

in
a
nice
dry
place
go
on
with
mary
go
on
with
moses
each
calling
for
his
favourite
tale
then
moran
with
a
suspicious
wriggle
of
his
body
and
a
clutch
at
his
rags
would
burst
out
with
all
me

if

any
blackguard
heretic
around

the
of
his
religious
tales
was
mary
of
egypt
a
long
poem
of
exceeding
solemnity
condensed
from
the
much
longer
work
of
a
certain
bishop
coyle
it
told
how
a
fast
woman
of
egypt
mary
by
name
followed
pilgrims
to
jerusalem
for
no
good
purpose
and
then
turning
penitent
on
finding
herself
withheld
from
entering
the
temple
by
supernatural
interference
fled
to
the
desert
and
spent
the
remainder
of
her
life
in
solitary
penance
when
at
last
she
was
at
the
point
of
death
god
sent
bishop
zozimus
to
hear
her
confession
give
her
the
last
sacrament
and
with
the
help
of
a
lion
whom
he
sent
also
dig
her
grave
the
poem
has
the
intolerable
cadence
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
was
so
popular
and
so
often
called
for
that
moran
was
soon
nicknamed
zozimus
and
by
that
name
is
he
remembered
he
had
also
a
poem
of
his
own
called
moses
which
went
a
little
nearer
poetry
without
going
very
near
but
he
could
ill
brook
solemnity
and
before
long
parodied
his
own
verses
in
the
following
ragamuffin
fashion
in
egypt
land
contagious
to
the
nile
king
pharaoh
daughter
went
to
bathe
in
style
she
tuk
her
dip
then
walked
unto
the
land
to
dry
her
royal
pelt
she
ran
along
the
strand
a
bulrush
tripped
her
whereupon
she
saw
a
smiling
babby
in
a
wad
o
straw
she
tuk
it
up
and
said
with
accents
mild
girls
which
av
yez
owns
the
child
his
humorous
rhymes
were
however
more
often
quips
and
cranks
at
the
expense
of
his
contemporaries
it
was
his
delight
for
instance
to
remind
a
certain
shoemaker
noted
alike
for
display
of
wealth
and
for
personal
uncleanness
of
his
inconsiderable
origin
in
a
song
of
which
but
the
first
stanza
has
come
down
to
us
at
the
dirty
end
of
dirty
lane
liv
a
dirty
cobbler
dick
maclane
his
wife
was
in
the
old
king
reign
a
stout
brave
on
essex
bridge
she
strained
her
throat
and
was
her
note
but
dickey
wore
a
coat
he
got
among
the
yeomen
he
was
a
bigot
like
his
clan
and
in
the
streets
he
wildly
sang
o
roly
toly
toly
raid
with
his
old
jade
he
had
troubles
of
divers
kinds
and
numerous
interlopers
to
face
and
put
down
once
an
officious
peeler
arrested
him
as
a
vagabond
but
was
triumphantly
routed
amid
the
laughter
of
the
court
when
moran
reminded
his
worship
of
the
precedent
set
by
homer
who
was
also
he
declared
a
poet
and
a
blind
man
and
a
beggarman
he
had
to
face
a
more
serious
difficulty
as
his
fame
grew
various
imitators
started
up
upon
all
sides
a
certain
actor
for
instance
made
as
many
guineas
as
moran
did
shillings
by
mimicking
his
sayings
and
his
songs
and
his
getup
upon
the
stage
one
night
this
actor
was
at
supper
with
some
friends
when
dispute
arose
as
to
whether
his
mimicry
was
overdone
or
not
it
was
agreed
to
settle
it
by
an
appeal
to
the
mob
a
supper
at
a
famous
coffeehouse
was
to
be
the
wager
the
actor
took
up
his
station
at
essex
bridge
a
great
haunt
of
moran
and
soon
gathered
a
small
crowd
he
had
scarce
got
through
in
egypt
land
contagious
to
the
nile
when
moran
himself
came
up
followed
by
another
crowd
the
crowds
met
in
great
excitement
and
laughter
good
christians
cried
the
pretender
is
it
possible
that
any
man
would
mock
the
poor
dark
man
like
that
who
that
it
some
imposhterer
replied
moran
begone
you
wretch
it
the
imposhterer
do
you
fear
the
light
of
heaven
being
struck
from
your
eyes
for
mocking
the
poor
dark
man
saints
and
angels
is
there
no
protection
against
this
you
a
most
to
try
to
deprive
me
of
my
honest
bread
this
way
replied
poor
moran
and
you
you
wretch
wo
let
me
go
on
with
the
beautiful
poem
christian
people
in
your
charity
wo
you
beat
this
man
away
taking
advantage
of
my
darkness
the
pretender
seeing
that
he
was
having
the
best
of
it
thanked
the
people
for
their
sympathy
and
protection
and
went
on
with
the
poem
moran
listening
for
a
time
in
bewildered
silence
after
a
while
moran
protested
again
with
is
it
possible
that
none
of
yez
can
know
me
do
yez
see
myself
and
that
some
one
else
before
i
can
proceed
any
further
in
this
lovely
story
interrupted
the
pretender
i
call
on
yez
to
contribute
your
charitable
donations
to
help
me
to
go
on
have
you
no
sowl
to
be
saved
you
mocker
of
heaven
cried
moran
put
completely
beside
himself
by
this
last
injury
would
you
rob
the
poor
as
well
as
desave
the
world
o
was
ever
such
wickedness
known
i
leave
it
to
yourselves
my
friends
said
the
pretender
to
give
to
the
real
dark
man
that
you
all
know
so
well
and
save
me
from
that
schemer
and
with
that
he
collected
some
pennies
and
while
he
was
doing
so
moran
started
his
mary
of
egypt
but
the
indignant
crowd
seizing
his
stick
were
about
to
belabour
him
when
they
fell
back
bewildered
anew
by
his
close
resemblance
to
himself
the
pretender
now
called
to
them
to
just
give
him
a
grip
of
that
villain
and
he
soon
let
him
know
who
the
imposhterer
was
they
led
him
over
to
moran
but
instead
of
closing
with
him
he
thrust
a
few
shillings
into
his
hand
and
turning
to
the
crowd
explained
to
them
he
was
indeed
but
an
actor
and
that
he
had
just
gained
a
wager
and
so
departed
amid
much
enthusiasm
to
eat
the
supper
he
had
won
in
april
word
was
sent
to
the
priest
that
michael
moran
was
dying
he
found
him
at
now
patrick
street
on
a
straw
bed
in
a
room
full
of
ragged
come
to
cheer
his
last
moments
after
his
death
the
with
many
fiddles
and
the
like
came
again
and
gave
him
a
fine
wake
each
adding
to
the
merriment
whatever
he
knew
in
the
way
of
rann
tale
old
saw
or
quaint
rhyme
he
had
had
his
day
had
said
his
prayers
and
made
his
confession
and
why
should
they
not
give
him
a
hearty
the
funeral
took
place
the
next
day
a
good
party
of
his
admirers
and
friends
got
into
the
hearse
with
the
coffin
for
the
day
was
wet
and
nasty
they
had
not
gone
far
when
one
of
them
burst
out
with
it
cruel
cowld
is
it
garra
replied
another
we
all
be
as
stiff
as
the
corpse
when
we
get
to
the
bad
cess
to
him
said
a
third
i
wish
he
held
out
another
month
until
the
weather
got
dacent
a
man
called
carroll
thereupon
produced
a
of
whiskey
and
they
all
drank
to
the
soul
of
the
departed
unhappily
however
the
hearse
was
and
they
had
not
reached
the
cemetery
before
the
spring
broke
and
the
bottle
with
it
moran
must
have
felt
strange
and
out
of
place
in
that
other
kingdom
he
was
entering
perhaps
while
his
friends
were
drinking
in
his
honour
let
us
hope
that
some
kindly
middle
region
was
found
for
him
where
he
can
call
dishevelled
angels
about
him
with
some
new
and
more
rhythmical
form
of
his
old
gather
round
me
boys
will
yez
gather
round
me
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
before
ould
salley
brings
me
my
bread
and
jug
of
tay
and
fling
outrageous
quips
and
cranks
at
cherubim
and
seraphim
perhaps
he
may
have
found
and
gathered
ragamuffin
though
he
be
the
lily
of
high
truth
the
rose
of
beauty
for
whose
lack
so
many
of
the
writers
of
ireland
whether
famous
or
forgotten
have
been
futile
as
the
blown
froth
upon
the
shore
regina
regina
pigmeorum
veni
one
night
a
man
who
had
lived
all
his
life
far
from
the
noise
of
a
young
girl
a
relation
of
his
who
was
reported
to
be
enough
of
a
seer
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
unaccountable
lights
moving
over
the
fields
among
the
cattle
and
myself
were
walking
along
a
far
western
sandy
shore
we
talked
of
the
forgetful
people
as
the
faery
people
are
sometimes
called
and
came
in
the
midst
of
our
talk
to
a
notable
haunt
of
theirs
a
shallow
cave
amidst
black
rocks
with
its
reflection
under
it
in
the
wet
sea
sand
i
asked
the
young
girl
if
she
could
see
anything
for
i
had
quite
a
number
of
things
to
ask
the
forgetful
people
she
stood
still
for
a
few
minutes
and
i
saw
that
she
was
passing
into
a
kind
of
waking
trance
in
which
the
cold
sea
breeze
no
longer
troubled
her
nor
the
dull
boom
of
the
sea
distracted
her
attention
i
then
called
aloud
the
names
of
the
great
faeries
and
in
a
moment
or
two
she
said
that
she
could
hear
music
far
inside
the
rocks
and
then
a
sound
of
confused
talking
and
of
people
stamping
their
feet
as
if
to
applaud
some
unseen
performer
up
to
this
my
other
friend
had
been
walking
to
and
fro
some
yards
off
but
now
he
passed
close
to
us
and
as
he
did
so
said
suddenly
that
we
were
going
to
be
interrupted
for
he
heard
the
laughter
of
children
somewhere
beyond
the
rocks
we
were
however
quite
alone
the
spirits
of
the
place
had
begun
to
cast
their
influence
over
him
also
in
a
moment
he
was
corroborated
by
the
girl
who
said
that
bursts
of
laughter
had
begun
to
mingle
with
the
music
the
confused
talking
and
the
noise
of
feet
she
next
saw
a
bright
light
streaming
out
of
the
cave
which
seemed
to
have
grown
much
deeper
and
a
quantity
of
little
people
fn
in
various
coloured
dresses
red
predominating
dancing
to
a
tune
which
she
did
not
recognize
fn
the
people
and
faeries
in
ireland
are
sometimes
as
big
as
we
are
sometimes
bigger
and
sometimes
as
i
have
been
told
about
three
feet
high
the
old
mayo
woman
i
so
often
quote
thinks
that
it
is
something
in
our
eyes
that
makes
them
seem
big
or
little
i
then
bade
her
call
out
to
the
queen
of
the
little
people
to
come
and
talk
with
us
there
was
however
no
answer
to
her
command
i
therefore
repeated
the
words
aloud
myself
and
in
a
moment
a
very
beautiful
tall
woman
came
out
of
the
cave
i
too
had
by
this
time
fallen
into
a
kind
of
trance
in
which
what
we
call
the
unreal
had
begun
to
take
upon
itself
a
masterful
reality
and
was
able
to
see
the
faint
gleam
of
golden
ornaments
the
shadowy
blossom
of
dim
hair
i
then
bade
the
girl
tell
this
tall
queen
to
marshal
her
followers
according
to
their
natural
divisions
that
we
might
see
them
i
found
as
before
that
i
had
to
repeat
the
command
myself
the
creatures
then
came
out
of
the
cave
and
drew
themselves
up
if
i
remember
rightly
in
four
bands
one
of
these
bands
carried
quicken
boughs
in
their
hands
and
another
had
necklaces
made
apparently
of
serpents
scales
but
their
dress
i
can
not
remember
for
i
was
quite
absorbed
in
that
gleaming
woman
i
asked
her
to
tell
the
seer
whether
these
caves
were
the
greatest
faery
haunts
in
the
neighbourhood
her
lips
moved
but
the
answer
was
inaudible
i
bade
the
seer
lay
her
hand
upon
the
breast
of
the
queen
and
after
that
she
heard
every
word
quite
distinctly
no
this
was
not
the
greatest
faery
haunt
for
there
was
a
greater
one
a
little
further
ahead
i
then
asked
her
whether
it
was
true
that
she
and
her
people
carried
away
mortals
and
if
so
whether
they
put
another
soul
in
the
place
of
the
one
they
had
taken
we
change
the
bodies
was
her
answer
are
any
of
you
ever
born
into
mortal
life
yes
do
i
know
any
who
were
among
your
people
before
birth
you
do
who
are
they
it
would
not
be
lawful
for
you
to
know
i
then
asked
whether
she
and
her
people
were
not
dramatizations
of
our
moods
she
does
not
understand
said
my
friend
but
says
that
her
people
are
much
like
human
beings
and
do
most
of
the
things
human
beings
do
i
asked
her
other
questions
as
to
her
nature
and
her
purpose
in
the
universe
but
only
seemed
to
puzzle
her
at
last
she
appeared
to
lose
patience
for
she
wrote
this
message
for
me
upon
the
sands
the
sands
of
vision
not
the
grating
sands
under
our
feet
be
careful
and
do
not
seek
to
know
too
much
about
us
seeing
that
i
had
offended
her
i
thanked
her
for
what
she
had
shown
and
told
and
let
her
depart
again
into
her
cave
in
a
little
while
the
young
girl
awoke
out
of
her
trance
and
felt
again
the
cold
wind
of
the
world
and
began
to
shiver
i
tell
these
things
as
accurately
as
i
can
and
with
no
theories
to
blur
the
history
theories
are
poor
things
at
the
best
and
the
bulk
of
mine
have
perished
long
ago
i
love
better
than
any
theory
the
sound
of
the
gate
of
ivory
turning
upon
its
hinges
and
hold
that
he
alone
who
has
passed
the
threshold
can
catch
the
far
glimmer
of
the
gate
of
horn
it
were
perhaps
well
for
us
all
if
we
would
but
raise
the
cry
lilly
the
astrologer
raised
in
windsor
forest
regina
regina
pigmeorum
veni
and
remember
with
him
that
god
visiteth
his
children
in
dreams
tall
glimmering
queen
come
near
and
let
me
see
again
the
shadowy
blossom
of
thy
dim
hair
and
fair
fierce
women
one
day
a
woman
that
i
know
came
face
to
face
with
heroic
beauty
that
highest
beauty
which
blake
says
changes
least
from
youth
to
age
a
beauty
which
has
been
fading
out
of
the
arts
since
that
decadence
we
call
progress
set
voluptuous
beauty
in
its
place
she
was
standing
at
the
window
looking
over
to
knocknarea
where
queen
maive
is
thought
to
be
buried
when
she
saw
as
she
has
told
me
the
finest
woman
you
ever
saw
travelling
right
across
from
the
mountain
and
straight
to
her
the
woman
had
a
sword
by
her
side
and
a
dagger
lifted
up
in
her
hand
and
was
dressed
in
white
with
bare
arms
and
feet
she
looked
very
strong
but
not
wicked
that
is
not
cruel
the
old
woman
had
seen
the
irish
giant
and
though
he
was
a
fine
man
he
was
nothing
to
this
woman
for
he
was
round
and
could
not
have
stepped
out
so
soldierly
she
was
like
a
stately
lady
of
the
neighbourhood
but
she
had
no
stomach
on
her
and
was
slight
and
broad
in
the
shoulders
and
was
handsomer
than
any
one
you
ever
saw
she
looked
about
thirty
the
old
woman
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
and
when
she
uncovered
them
the
apparition
had
vanished
the
neighbours
were
wild
with
her
she
told
me
because
she
did
not
wait
to
find
out
if
there
was
a
message
for
they
were
sure
it
was
queen
maive
who
often
shows
herself
to
the
pilots
i
asked
the
old
woman
if
she
had
seen
others
like
queen
maive
and
she
said
some
of
them
have
their
hair
down
but
they
look
quite
different
like
the
ladies
one
sees
in
the
papers
those
with
their
hair
up
are
like
this
one
the
others
have
long
white
dresses
but
those
with
their
hair
up
have
short
dresses
so
that
you
can
see
their
legs
right
up
to
the
calf
after
some
careful
questioning
i
found
that
they
wore
what
might
very
well
be
a
kind
of
buskin
she
went
on
they
are
fine
and
dashing
looking
like
the
men
one
sees
riding
their
horses
in
twos
and
threes
on
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
with
their
swords
swinging
she
repeated
over
and
over
there
is
no
such
race
living
now
none
so
finely
proportioned
or
the
like
and
then
said
the
present
queen
fn
is
a
nice
looking
woman
but
she
is
not
like
her
what
makes
me
think
so
little
of
the
ladies
is
that
i
see
none
as
they
be
meaning
as
the
spirits
when
i
think
of
her
and
of
the
ladies
now
they
are
like
little
children
running
about
without
knowing
how
to
put
their
clothes
on
right
is
it
the
ladies
why
i
would
not
call
them
women
at
all
the
other
day
a
friend
of
mine
questioned
an
old
woman
in
a
galway
workhouse
about
queen
maive
and
was
told
that
queen
maive
was
handsome
and
overcame
all
her
enemies
with
a
bawl
stick
for
the
hazel
is
blessed
and
the
best
weapon
that
can
be
got
you
might
walk
the
world
with
it
but
she
grew
very
disagreeable
in
the
end
oh
very
disagreeable
best
not
to
be
talking
about
it
best
leave
it
between
the
book
and
the
hearer
my
friend
thought
the
old
woman
had
got
some
scandal
about
fergus
son
of
roy
and
maive
in
her
head
fn
queen
victoria
and
i
myself
met
once
with
a
young
man
in
the
burren
hills
who
remembered
an
old
poet
who
made
his
poems
in
irish
and
had
met
when
he
was
young
the
young
man
said
one
who
called
herself
maive
and
said
she
was
a
queen
among
them
and
asked
him
if
he
would
have
money
or
pleasure
he
said
he
would
have
pleasure
and
she
gave
him
her
love
for
a
time
and
then
went
from
him
and
ever
after
he
was
very
mournful
the
young
man
had
often
heard
him
sing
the
poem
of
lamentation
that
he
made
but
could
only
remember
that
it
was
very
mournful
and
that
he
called
her
beauty
of
all
beauties
enchanted
woods
i
last
summer
whenever
i
had
finished
my
day
work
i
used
to
go
wandering
in
certain
roomy
woods
and
there
i
would
often
meet
an
old
countryman
and
talk
to
him
about
his
work
and
about
the
woods
and
once
or
twice
a
friend
came
with
me
to
whom
he
would
open
his
heart
more
readily
than
to
me
he
had
spent
all
his
life
lopping
away
the
witch
elm
and
the
hazel
and
the
privet
and
the
hornbeam
from
the
paths
and
had
thought
much
about
the
natural
and
supernatural
creatures
of
the
wood
he
has
heard
the
hedgehog
grainne
oge
he
calls
him
grunting
like
a
christian
and
is
certain
that
he
steals
apples
by
rolling
about
under
an
apple
tree
until
there
is
an
apple
sticking
to
every
quill
he
is
certain
too
that
the
cats
of
whom
there
are
many
in
the
woods
have
a
language
of
their
own
some
kind
of
old
irish
he
says
cats
were
serpents
and
they
were
made
into
cats
at
the
time
of
some
great
change
in
the
world
that
is
why
they
are
hard
to
kill
and
why
it
is
dangerous
to
meddle
with
them
if
you
annoy
a
cat
it
might
claw
or
bite
you
in
a
way
that
would
put
poison
in
you
and
that
would
be
the
serpent
tooth
sometimes
he
thinks
they
change
into
wild
cats
and
then
a
nail
grows
on
the
end
of
their
tails
but
these
wild
cats
are
not
the
same
as
the
marten
cats
who
have
been
always
in
the
woods
the
foxes
were
once
tame
as
the
cats
are
now
but
they
ran
away
and
became
wild
he
talks
of
all
wild
creatures
except
squirrels
whom
he
hates
with
what
seems
an
affectionate
interest
though
at
times
his
eyes
will
twinkle
with
pleasure
as
he
remembers
how
he
made
hedgehogs
unroll
themselves
when
he
was
a
boy
by
putting
a
wisp
of
burning
straw
under
them
i
am
not
certain
that
he
distinguishes
between
the
natural
and
supernatural
very
clearly
he
told
me
the
other
day
that
foxes
and
cats
like
above
all
to
be
in
the
forths
and
lisses
after
nightfall
and
he
will
certainly
pass
from
some
story
about
a
fox
to
a
story
about
a
spirit
with
less
change
of
voice
than
when
he
is
going
to
speak
about
a
marten
cat
a
rare
beast
many
years
ago
he
used
to
work
in
the
garden
and
once
they
put
him
to
sleep
in
a
where
there
was
a
loft
full
of
apples
and
all
night
he
could
hear
people
rattling
plates
and
knives
and
forks
over
his
head
in
the
loft
once
at
any
rate
be
has
seen
an
unearthly
sight
in
the
woods
he
says
one
time
i
was
out
cutting
timber
over
in
inchy
and
about
eight
one
morning
when
i
got
there
i
saw
a
girl
picking
nuts
with
her
hair
hanging
down
over
her
shoulders
brown
hair
and
she
had
a
good
clean
face
and
she
was
tall
and
nothing
on
her
head
and
her
dress
no
way
gaudy
but
simple
and
when
she
felt
me
coming
she
gathered
herself
up
and
was
gone
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
her
up
and
i
followed
her
and
looked
for
her
but
i
never
could
see
her
again
from
that
day
to
this
never
again
he
used
the
word
clean
as
we
would
use
words
like
fresh
or
comely
others
too
have
seen
spirits
in
the
enchanted
woods
a
labourer
told
us
of
what
a
friend
of
his
had
seen
in
a
part
of
the
woods
that
is
called
shanwalla
from
some
old
village
that
was
before
the
weed
he
said
one
evening
i
parted
from
lawrence
mangan
in
the
yard
and
he
went
away
through
the
path
in
shanwalla
an
bid
me
goodnight
and
two
hours
after
there
he
was
back
again
in
the
yard
an
bid
me
light
a
candle
that
was
in
the
stable
an
he
told
me
that
when
he
got
into
shanwalla
a
little
fellow
about
as
high
as
his
knee
but
having
a
head
as
big
as
a
man
body
came
beside
him
and
led
him
out
of
the
path
round
about
and
at
last
it
brought
him
to
the
and
then
it
vanished
and
left
him
a
woman
told
me
of
a
sight
that
she
and
others
had
seen
by
a
certain
deep
pool
in
the
river
she
said
i
came
over
the
stile
from
the
chapel
and
others
along
with
me
and
a
great
blast
of
wind
came
and
two
trees
were
bent
and
broken
and
fell
into
the
river
and
the
splash
of
water
out
of
it
went
up
to
the
skies
and
those
that
were
with
me
saw
many
figures
but
myself
i
only
saw
one
sitting
there
by
the
bank
where
the
trees
fell
dark
clothes
he
had
on
and
he
was
headless
a
man
told
me
that
one
day
when
he
was
a
boy
he
and
another
boy
went
to
catch
a
horse
in
a
certain
field
full
of
boulders
and
bushes
of
hazel
and
creeping
juniper
and
that
is
where
the
lake
side
is
for
a
little
clear
of
the
woods
he
said
to
the
boy
that
was
with
him
i
bet
a
button
that
if
i
fling
a
pebble
on
to
that
bush
it
will
stay
on
it
meaning
that
the
bush
was
so
matted
the
pebble
would
not
be
able
to
go
through
it
so
he
took
up
a
pebble
of
and
as
soon
as
it
hit
the
bush
there
came
out
of
it
the
most
beautiful
music
that
ever
was
heard
they
ran
away
and
when
they
had
gone
about
two
hundred
yards
they
looked
back
and
saw
a
woman
dressed
in
white
walking
round
and
round
the
bush
first
it
had
the
form
of
a
woman
and
then
of
a
man
and
it
was
going
round
the
bush
ii
i
often
entangle
myself
in
argument
more
complicated
than
even
those
paths
of
inchy
as
to
what
is
the
true
nature
of
apparitions
but
at
other
times
i
say
as
socrates
said
when
they
told
him
a
learned
opinion
about
a
nymph
of
the
illissus
the
common
opinion
is
enough
for
me
i
believe
when
i
am
in
the
mood
that
all
nature
is
full
of
people
whom
we
can
not
see
and
that
some
of
these
are
ugly
or
grotesque
and
some
wicked
or
foolish
but
very
many
beautiful
beyond
any
one
we
have
ever
seen
and
that
these
are
not
far
away
when
we
are
walking
in
pleasant
and
quiet
places
even
when
i
was
a
boy
i
could
never
walk
in
a
wood
without
feeling
that
at
any
moment
i
might
find
before
me
somebody
or
something
i
had
long
looked
for
without
knowing
what
i
looked
for
and
now
i
will
at
times
explore
every
little
nook
of
some
poor
coppice
with
almost
anxious
footsteps
so
deep
a
hold
has
this
imagination
upon
me
you
too
meet
with
a
like
imagination
doubtless
somewhere
wherever
your
ruling
stars
will
have
it
saturn
driving
you
to
the
woods
or
the
moon
it
may
be
to
the
edges
of
the
sea
i
will
not
of
a
certainty
believe
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
sunset
where
our
forefathers
imagined
the
dead
following
their
shepherd
the
sun
or
nothing
but
some
vague
presence
as
little
moving
as
nothing
if
beauty
is
not
a
gateway
out
of
the
net
we
were
taken
in
at
our
birth
it
will
not
long
be
beauty
and
we
will
find
it
better
to
sit
at
home
by
the
fire
and
fatten
a
lazy
body
or
to
run
hither
and
thither
in
some
foolish
sport
than
to
look
at
the
finest
show
that
light
and
shadow
ever
made
among
green
leaves
i
say
to
myself
when
i
am
well
out
of
that
thicket
of
argument
that
they
are
surely
there
the
divine
people
for
only
we
who
have
neither
simplicity
nor
wisdom
have
denied
them
and
the
simple
of
all
times
and
the
wise
men
of
ancient
times
have
seen
them
and
even
spoken
to
them
they
live
out
their
passionate
lives
not
far
off
as
i
think
and
we
shall
be
among
them
when
we
die
if
we
but
keep
our
natures
simple
and
passionate
may
it
not
even
be
that
death
shall
unite
us
to
all
romance
and
that
some
day
we
shall
fight
dragons
among
blue
hills
or
come
to
that
whereof
all
romance
is
but
foreshadowings
mingled
with
the
images
of
man
misdeeds
in
greater
days
than
these
as
the
old
men
thought
in
the
earthly
paradise
when
they
were
in
good
spirits
miraculous
creatures
there
are
marten
cats
and
badgers
and
foxes
in
the
enchanted
woods
but
there
are
of
a
certainty
mightier
creatures
and
the
lake
hides
what
neither
net
nor
fine
can
take
these
creatures
are
of
the
race
of
the
white
stag
that
flits
in
and
out
of
the
tales
of
arthur
and
of
the
evil
pig
that
slew
diarmuid
where
ben
bulben
mixes
with
the
sea
wind
they
are
the
wizard
creatures
of
hope
and
fear
they
are
of
them
that
fly
and
of
them
that
follow
among
the
thickets
that
are
about
the
gates
of
death
a
man
i
know
remembers
that
his
father
was
one
night
in
the
wood
of
inchy
where
the
lads
of
gort
used
to
be
stealing
rods
he
was
sitting
by
the
wall
and
the
dog
beside
him
and
he
heard
something
come
running
from
owbawn
weir
and
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
sound
of
its
feet
on
the
ground
was
like
the
sound
of
the
feet
of
a
deer
and
when
it
passed
him
the
dog
got
between
him
and
the
wall
and
scratched
at
it
there
as
if
it
was
afraid
but
still
he
could
see
nothing
but
only
hear
the
sound
of
hoofs
so
when
it
was
passed
he
turned
and
came
away
home
another
time
the
man
says
my
father
told
me
he
was
in
a
boat
out
on
the
lake
with
two
or
three
men
from
gort
and
one
of
them
had
an
and
he
thrust
it
into
the
water
and
it
hit
something
and
the
man
fainted
and
they
had
to
carry
him
out
of
the
boat
to
land
and
when
he
came
to
himself
he
said
that
what
he
struck
was
like
a
calf
but
whatever
it
was
it
was
not
fish
a
friend
of
mine
is
convinced
that
these
terrible
creatures
so
common
in
lakes
were
set
there
in
old
times
by
subtle
enchanters
to
watch
over
the
gates
of
wisdom
he
thinks
that
if
we
sent
our
spirits
down
into
the
water
we
would
make
them
of
one
substance
with
strange
moods
of
ecstasy
and
power
and
go
out
it
may
be
to
the
conquest
of
the
world
we
would
however
he
believes
have
first
to
outface
and
perhaps
overthrow
strange
images
full
of
a
more
powerful
life
than
if
they
were
really
alive
it
may
be
that
we
shall
look
at
them
without
fear
when
we
have
endured
the
last
adventure
that
is
death
aristotle
of
the
books
the
friend
who
can
get
the
to
talk
more
readily
than
he
will
to
anybody
else
went
lately
to
see
his
old
wife
she
lives
in
a
cottage
not
far
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
is
as
full
of
old
talk
as
her
husband
this
time
she
began
to
talk
of
goban
the
legendary
mason
and
his
wisdom
but
said
presently
aristotle
of
the
books
too
was
very
wise
and
he
had
a
great
deal
of
experience
but
did
not
the
bees
get
the
better
of
him
in
the
end
he
wanted
to
know
how
they
packed
the
comb
and
he
wasted
the
better
part
of
a
fortnight
watching
them
and
he
could
not
see
them
doing
it
then
he
made
a
hive
with
a
glass
cover
on
it
and
put
it
over
them
and
he
thought
to
see
but
when
he
went
and
put
his
eyes
to
the
glass
they
had
it
all
covered
with
wax
so
that
it
was
as
black
as
the
pot
and
he
was
as
blind
as
before
he
said
he
was
never
rightly
kilt
till
then
they
had
him
that
time
surely
the
swine
of
the
gods
a
few
years
ago
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
of
something
that
happened
to
him
when
he
was
young
man
and
out
drilling
with
some
connaught
fenians
they
were
but
a
and
drove
along
a
hillside
until
they
came
to
a
quiet
place
they
left
the
car
and
went
further
up
the
hill
with
their
rifles
and
drilled
for
a
while
as
they
were
coming
down
again
they
saw
a
very
thin
pig
of
the
old
irish
sort
and
the
pig
began
to
follow
them
one
of
them
cried
out
as
a
joke
that
it
was
a
fairy
pig
and
they
all
began
to
run
to
keep
up
the
joke
the
pig
ran
too
and
presently
how
nobody
knew
this
mock
terror
became
real
terror
and
they
ran
as
for
their
lives
when
they
got
to
the
car
they
made
the
horse
gallop
as
fast
as
possible
but
the
pig
still
followed
then
one
of
them
put
up
his
rifle
to
fire
but
when
he
looked
along
the
barrel
he
could
see
nothing
presently
they
turned
a
corner
and
came
to
a
village
they
told
the
people
of
the
village
what
had
happened
and
the
people
of
the
village
took
pitchforks
and
spades
and
the
like
and
went
along
the
road
with
them
to
drive
the
pig
away
when
they
turned
the
comer
they
could
not
find
anything
a
voice
one
day
i
was
walking
over
a
bit
of
marshy
ground
close
to
inchy
wood
when
i
felt
all
of
a
sudden
and
only
for
a
second
an
emotion
which
i
said
to
myself
was
the
root
of
christian
mysticism
there
had
swept
over
me
a
sense
of
weakness
of
dependence
on
a
great
personal
being
somewhere
far
off
yet
near
at
hand
no
thought
of
mine
had
prepared
me
for
this
emotion
for
i
had
been
with
aengus
and
edain
and
with
mannanan
son
of
the
sea
that
night
i
awoke
lying
upon
my
back
and
hearing
a
voice
speaking
above
me
and
saying
no
human
soul
is
like
any
other
human
soul
and
therefore
the
love
of
god
for
any
human
soul
is
infinite
for
no
other
soul
can
satisfy
the
same
need
in
god
a
few
nights
after
this
i
awoke
to
see
the
loveliest
people
i
have
ever
seen
a
young
man
and
a
young
girl
dressed
in
raiment
cut
like
old
greek
raiment
were
standing
at
my
bedside
i
looked
at
the
girl
and
noticed
that
her
dress
was
gathered
about
her
neck
into
a
kind
of
chain
or
perhaps
into
some
kind
of
stiff
embroidery
which
represented
but
what
filled
me
with
wonder
was
the
miraculous
mildness
of
her
face
there
are
no
such
faces
now
it
was
beautiful
as
few
faces
are
beautiful
but
it
had
neither
one
would
think
the
light
that
is
in
desire
or
in
hope
or
in
fear
or
in
speculation
it
was
peaceful
like
the
faces
of
animals
or
like
mountain
pools
at
evening
so
peaceful
that
it
was
a
little
sad
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
might
be
the
beloved
of
aengus
but
how
could
that
hunted
alluring
happy
immortal
wretch
have
a
face
like
this
doubtless
she
was
from
among
the
children
of
the
moon
but
who
among
them
i
shall
never
know
kidnappers
a
little
north
of
the
town
of
sligo
on
the
southern
side
of
ben
bulben
some
hundreds
of
feet
above
the
plain
is
a
small
white
square
in
the
limestone
no
mortal
has
ever
touched
it
with
his
hand
no
sheep
or
goat
has
ever
browsed
grass
beside
it
there
is
no
more
inaccessible
place
upon
the
earth
and
few
more
encircled
by
awe
to
the
deep
considering
it
is
the
door
of
in
the
middle
of
night
it
swings
open
and
the
unearthly
troop
rushes
out
all
night
the
gay
rabble
sweep
to
and
fro
across
the
land
invisible
to
all
unless
perhaps
where
in
some
more
than
commonly
gentle
place
drumcliff
or
the
nightcapped
heads
of
may
be
thrust
from
their
doors
to
see
what
mischief
the
gentry
are
doing
to
their
trained
eyes
and
ears
the
fields
are
covered
by
riders
and
the
air
is
full
of
shrill
voices
a
sound
like
whistling
as
an
ancient
scottish
seer
has
recorded
and
wholly
different
from
the
talk
of
the
angels
who
speak
much
in
the
throat
like
the
irish
as
lilly
the
astrologer
has
wisely
said
if
there
be
a
baby
or
bride
in
the
neighbourhood
the
nightcapped
doctors
will
peer
with
more
than
common
care
for
the
unearthly
troop
do
not
always
return
sometimes
a
bride
or
a
baby
goes
with
them
into
their
mountains
the
door
swings
to
behind
and
the
or
the
moves
henceforth
in
the
bloodless
land
of
faery
happy
enough
but
doomed
to
melt
out
at
the
last
judgment
like
bright
vapour
for
the
soul
can
not
live
without
sorrow
through
this
door
of
white
stone
and
the
other
doors
of
that
land
where
geabheadh
tu
an
sonas
aer
pighin
you
can
buy
joy
for
a
penny
have
gone
kings
queens
and
princes
but
so
greatly
has
the
power
of
faery
dwindled
that
there
are
none
but
peasants
in
these
sad
chronicles
of
mine
somewhere
about
the
beginning
of
last
century
appeared
at
the
western
corner
of
market
street
sligo
where
the
butcher
shop
now
is
not
a
palace
as
in
keats
lamia
but
an
apothecary
shop
ruled
over
by
a
certain
unaccountable
opendon
where
he
came
from
none
ever
knew
there
also
was
in
sligo
in
those
days
a
woman
ormsby
by
name
whose
husband
had
fallen
mysteriously
sick
the
doctors
could
make
nothing
of
him
nothing
seemed
wrong
with
him
yet
weaker
and
weaker
he
grew
away
went
the
wife
to
opendon
she
was
shown
into
the
shop
parlour
a
black
cat
was
sitting
straight
up
before
the
fire
she
had
just
time
to
see
that
the
was
covered
with
fruit
and
to
say
to
herself
fruit
must
be
wholesome
when
the
doctor
has
so
much
before
opendon
came
in
he
was
dressed
all
in
black
the
same
as
the
cat
and
his
wife
walked
behind
him
dressed
in
black
likewise
she
gave
him
a
guinea
and
got
a
little
bottle
in
return
her
husband
recovered
that
time
meanwhile
the
black
doctor
cured
many
people
but
one
day
a
rich
patient
died
and
cat
wife
and
doctor
all
vanished
the
night
after
in
a
year
the
man
ormsby
fell
sick
once
more
now
he
was
a
goodlooking
man
and
his
wife
felt
sure
the
gentry
were
coveting
him
she
went
and
called
on
the
at
cairnsfoot
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
her
tale
he
went
behind
the
back
door
and
began
muttering
muttering
spells
her
husband
got
well
this
time
also
but
after
a
while
he
sickened
again
the
fatal
third
time
and
away
went
she
once
more
to
cairnsfoot
and
out
went
the
behind
his
back
door
and
began
muttering
but
soon
he
came
in
and
told
her
it
was
no
use
her
husband
would
die
and
sure
enough
the
man
died
and
ever
after
when
she
spoke
of
him
ormsby
shook
her
head
saying
she
knew
well
where
he
was
and
it
was
in
heaven
or
hell
or
purgatory
either
she
probably
believed
that
a
log
of
wood
was
left
behind
in
his
place
but
so
bewitched
that
it
seemed
the
dead
body
of
her
husband
she
is
dead
now
herself
but
many
still
living
remember
her
she
was
i
believe
for
a
time
a
servant
or
else
a
kind
of
pensioner
of
some
relations
of
my
own
sometimes
those
who
are
carried
off
are
allowed
after
many
years
seven
usually
a
final
glimpse
of
their
friends
many
years
ago
a
woman
vanished
suddenly
from
a
sligo
garden
where
she
was
walking
with
her
husband
when
her
son
who
was
then
a
baby
had
grown
up
he
received
word
in
some
way
not
handed
down
that
his
mother
was
glamoured
by
faeries
and
imprisoned
for
the
time
in
a
house
in
glasgow
and
longing
to
see
him
glasgow
in
those
days
of
seemed
to
the
peasant
mind
almost
over
the
edge
of
the
known
world
yet
he
being
a
dutiful
son
started
away
for
a
long
time
he
walked
the
streets
of
glasgow
at
last
down
in
a
cellar
he
saw
his
mother
working
she
was
happy
she
said
and
had
the
best
of
good
eating
and
would
he
not
eat
and
therewith
laid
all
kinds
of
food
on
the
table
but
he
knowing
well
that
she
was
trying
to
cast
on
him
the
glamour
by
giving
him
faery
food
that
she
might
keep
him
with
her
refused
and
came
home
to
his
people
in
sligo
some
five
miles
southward
of
sligo
is
a
gloomy
and
pond
a
great
of
called
because
of
its
form
the
heart
lake
it
is
haunted
by
stranger
things
than
heron
snipe
or
wild
duck
out
of
this
lake
as
from
the
white
square
stone
in
ben
bulben
issues
an
unearthly
troop
once
men
began
to
drain
it
suddenly
one
of
them
raised
a
cry
that
he
saw
his
house
in
flames
they
turned
round
and
every
man
there
saw
his
own
cottage
burning
they
hurried
home
to
find
it
was
but
faery
glamour
to
this
hour
on
the
border
of
the
lake
is
shown
a
trench
the
signet
of
their
impiety
a
little
way
from
this
lake
i
heard
a
beautiful
and
mournful
history
of
faery
kidnapping
i
heard
it
from
a
little
old
woman
in
a
white
cap
who
sings
to
herself
in
gaelic
and
moves
from
one
foot
to
the
other
as
though
she
remembered
the
dancing
of
her
youth
a
young
man
going
at
nightfall
to
the
house
of
his
just
married
bride
met
in
the
way
a
jolly
company
and
with
them
his
bride
they
were
faeries
and
had
stolen
her
as
a
wife
for
the
chief
of
their
band
to
him
they
seemed
only
a
company
of
merry
mortals
his
bride
when
she
saw
her
old
love
bade
him
welcome
but
was
most
fearful
lest
be
should
eat
the
faery
food
and
so
be
glamoured
out
of
the
earth
into
that
bloodless
dim
nation
wherefore
she
set
him
down
to
play
cards
with
three
of
the
cavalcade
and
he
played
on
realizing
nothing
until
he
saw
the
chief
of
the
band
carrying
his
bride
away
in
his
arms
immediately
he
started
up
and
knew
that
they
were
faeries
for
slowly
all
that
jolly
company
melted
into
shadow
and
night
he
hurried
to
the
house
of
his
beloved
as
he
drew
near
came
to
him
the
cry
of
the
keeners
she
had
died
some
time
before
he
came
some
noteless
gaelic
poet
had
made
this
into
a
forgotten
ballad
some
odd
verses
of
which
my
friend
remembered
and
sang
for
me
sometimes
one
hears
of
stolen
people
acting
as
good
genii
to
the
living
as
in
this
tale
heard
also
close
by
the
haunted
pond
of
john
kirwan
of
castle
hacket
the
kirwans
fn
are
a
family
much
rumoured
of
in
peasant
stories
and
believed
to
be
the
descendants
of
a
man
and
a
spirit
they
have
ever
been
famous
for
beauty
and
i
have
read
that
the
mother
of
the
present
lord
cloncurry
was
of
their
tribe
fn
i
have
since
heard
that
it
was
not
the
kirwans
but
their
predecessors
at
castle
hacket
the
hackets
themselves
i
think
who
were
descended
from
a
man
and
a
spirit
and
were
notable
for
beauty
i
imagine
that
the
mother
of
lord
cloncurry
was
descended
from
the
hackets
it
may
well
be
that
all
through
these
stories
the
name
of
kirwan
has
taken
the
place
of
the
older
name
legend
mixes
everything
together
in
her
cauldron
john
kirwan
was
a
great
man
and
once
landed
in
liverpool
with
a
fine
horse
going
racing
somewhere
in
middle
england
that
evening
as
he
walked
by
the
docks
a
slip
of
a
boy
came
up
and
asked
where
he
was
stabling
his
horse
in
such
and
such
a
place
he
answered
do
put
him
there
said
the
slip
of
a
boy
that
stable
will
be
burnt
he
took
his
horse
elsewhere
and
sure
enough
the
stable
was
burnt
down
next
day
the
boy
came
and
asked
as
reward
to
ride
as
his
jockey
in
the
coming
race
and
then
was
gone
the
came
round
at
the
last
moment
the
boy
ran
forward
and
mounted
saying
if
i
strike
him
with
the
whip
in
my
left
hand
i
will
lose
but
if
in
my
right
hand
bet
all
you
are
worth
for
said
paddy
flynn
who
told
me
the
tale
the
left
arm
is
good
for
nothing
i
might
go
on
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
it
and
all
that
come
christmas
and
a
banshee
or
such
like
would
no
more
mind
than
if
it
was
that
broom
well
the
slip
of
a
boy
struck
the
horse
with
his
right
hand
and
john
kirwan
cleared
the
field
out
when
the
race
was
over
what
can
i
do
for
you
now
said
he
nothing
but
this
said
the
boy
my
mother
has
a
cottage
on
your
stole
me
from
the
cradle
be
good
to
her
john
kirwan
and
wherever
your
horses
go
i
will
watch
that
no
ill
follows
them
but
you
will
never
see
me
more
with
that
he
made
himself
air
and
vanished
sometimes
animals
are
carried
off
apparently
drowned
animals
more
than
others
in
claremorris
galway
paddy
flynn
told
me
lived
a
poor
widow
with
one
cow
and
its
calf
the
cow
fell
into
the
river
and
was
washed
away
there
was
a
man
thereabouts
who
went
to
a
woman
for
such
are
supposed
to
be
wise
in
these
things
and
she
told
him
to
take
the
calf
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
and
hide
himself
and
watch
he
did
as
she
had
told
him
and
as
evening
came
on
the
calf
began
to
low
and
after
a
while
the
cow
came
along
the
edge
of
the
river
and
commenced
suckling
it
then
as
he
had
been
told
he
caught
the
cow
tail
away
they
went
at
a
great
pace
across
hedges
and
ditches
till
they
came
to
a
royalty
a
name
for
the
little
circular
ditches
commonly
called
raths
or
forts
that
ireland
is
covered
with
since
pagan
times
therein
he
saw
walking
or
sitting
all
the
people
who
had
died
out
of
his
village
in
his
time
a
woman
was
sitting
on
the
edge
with
a
child
on
her
knees
and
she
called
out
to
him
to
mind
what
the
woman
had
told
him
and
he
remembered
she
had
said
bleed
the
cow
so
he
stuck
his
knife
into
the
cow
and
drew
blood
that
broke
the
spell
and
he
was
able
to
turn
her
homeward
do
not
forget
the
spancel
said
the
woman
with
the
child
on
her
knees
take
the
inside
one
there
were
three
spancels
on
a
bush
he
took
one
and
the
cow
was
driven
safely
home
to
the
widow
there
is
hardly
a
valley
or
mountainside
where
folk
can
not
tell
you
of
some
one
pillaged
from
amongst
them
two
or
three
miles
from
the
heart
lake
lives
an
old
woman
who
was
stolen
away
in
her
youth
after
seven
years
she
was
brought
home
again
for
some
reason
or
other
but
she
had
no
toes
left
she
had
danced
them
off
many
near
the
white
stone
door
in
ben
bulben
have
been
stolen
away
it
is
far
easier
to
be
sensible
in
cities
than
in
many
country
places
i
could
tell
you
of
when
one
walks
on
those
grey
roads
at
evening
by
the
scented
of
the
white
cottages
watching
the
faint
mountains
gathering
the
clouds
upon
their
heads
one
all
too
readily
discovers
beyond
the
thin
cobweb
veil
of
the
senses
those
creatures
the
goblins
hurrying
from
the
white
square
stone
door
to
the
north
or
from
the
heart
lake
in
the
south
the
untiring
ones
it
is
one
of
the
great
troubles
of
life
that
we
can
not
have
any
unmixed
emotions
there
is
always
something
in
our
enemy
that
we
like
and
something
in
our
sweetheart
that
we
dislike
it
is
this
entanglement
of
moods
which
makes
us
old
and
puckers
our
brows
and
deepens
the
furrows
about
our
eyes
if
we
could
love
and
hate
with
as
good
heart
as
the
faeries
do
we
might
grow
to
be
like
them
but
until
that
day
their
untiring
joys
and
sorrows
must
ever
be
half
of
their
fascination
love
with
them
never
grows
weary
nor
can
the
circles
of
the
stars
tire
out
their
dancing
feet
the
donegal
peasants
remember
this
when
they
bend
over
the
spade
or
sit
full
of
the
heaviness
of
the
fields
beside
the
griddle
at
nightfall
and
they
tell
stories
about
it
that
it
may
not
be
forgotten
a
short
while
ago
they
say
two
faeries
little
creatures
one
like
a
young
man
one
like
a
young
woman
came
to
a
farmer
house
and
spent
the
night
sweeping
the
hearth
and
setting
all
tidy
the
next
night
they
came
again
and
while
the
farmer
was
away
brought
all
the
furniture
into
one
room
and
having
arranged
it
round
the
walls
for
the
greater
grandeur
it
seems
they
began
to
dance
they
danced
on
and
on
and
days
and
days
went
by
and
all
the
came
to
look
at
them
but
still
their
feet
never
tired
the
farmer
did
not
dare
to
live
at
home
the
while
and
after
three
months
he
made
up
his
mind
to
stand
it
no
more
and
went
and
told
them
that
the
priest
was
coming
the
little
creatures
when
they
heard
this
went
back
to
their
own
country
and
there
their
joy
shall
last
as
long
as
the
points
of
the
rushes
are
brown
the
people
say
and
that
is
until
god
shall
burn
up
the
world
with
a
kiss
but
it
is
not
merely
faeries
who
know
untiring
days
for
there
have
been
men
and
women
who
falling
under
their
enchantment
have
attained
perhaps
by
the
right
of
their
spirits
an
even
more
than
faery
abundance
of
life
and
feeling
it
seems
that
when
mortals
have
gone
amid
those
poor
happy
leaves
of
the
imperishable
rose
of
beauty
blown
hither
and
thither
by
the
winds
that
awakened
the
stars
the
dim
kingdom
has
acknowledged
their
birthright
perhaps
a
little
sadly
and
given
them
of
its
best
such
a
mortal
was
born
long
ago
at
a
village
in
the
south
of
ireland
she
lay
asleep
in
a
cradle
and
her
mother
sat
by
rocking
her
when
a
woman
of
the
sidhe
the
faeries
came
in
and
said
that
the
child
was
chosen
to
be
the
bride
of
the
prince
of
the
dim
kingdom
but
that
as
it
would
never
do
for
his
wife
to
grow
old
and
die
while
he
was
still
in
the
first
ardour
of
his
love
she
would
be
gifted
with
a
faery
life
the
mother
was
to
take
the
glowing
log
out
of
the
fire
and
bury
it
in
the
garden
and
her
child
would
live
as
long
as
it
remained
unconsumed
the
mother
buried
the
log
and
the
child
grew
up
became
a
beauty
and
married
the
prince
of
the
faeries
who
came
to
her
at
nightfall
after
seven
hundred
years
the
prince
died
and
another
prince
ruled
in
his
stead
and
married
the
beautiful
peasant
girl
in
his
turn
and
after
another
seven
hundred
years
he
died
also
and
another
prince
and
another
husband
came
in
his
stead
and
so
on
until
she
had
had
seven
husbands
at
last
one
day
the
priest
of
the
parish
called
upon
her
and
told
her
that
she
was
a
scandal
to
the
whole
neighbourhood
with
her
seven
husbands
and
her
long
life
she
was
very
sorry
she
said
but
she
was
not
to
blame
and
then
she
told
him
about
the
log
and
he
went
straight
out
and
dug
until
he
found
it
and
then
they
burned
it
and
she
died
and
was
buried
like
a
christian
and
everybody
was
pleased
such
a
mortal
too
was
fn
who
went
all
over
the
world
seeking
a
lake
deep
enough
to
drown
her
faery
life
of
which
she
had
grown
weary
leaping
from
hill
to
lake
and
lake
to
hill
and
setting
up
a
cairn
of
stones
wherever
her
feet
lighted
until
at
last
she
found
the
deepest
water
in
the
world
in
little
lough
ia
on
the
top
of
the
birds
mountain
at
sligo
fn
doubtless
should
be
cailleac
bare
which
would
mean
the
old
woman
bare
bare
or
bere
or
verah
or
dera
or
dhera
was
a
very
famous
person
perhaps
the
mother
of
the
gods
herself
a
friend
of
mine
found
her
as
he
thinks
frequenting
lough
leath
or
the
grey
lake
on
a
mountain
of
the
fews
perhaps
lough
ia
is
my
mishearing
or
the
storyteller
mispronunciation
of
lough
leath
for
there
are
many
lough
leaths
the
two
little
creatures
may
well
dance
on
and
the
woman
of
the
log
and
sleep
in
peace
for
they
have
known
untrammelled
hate
and
unmixed
love
and
have
never
wearied
themselves
with
yes
and
no
or
entangled
their
feet
with
the
sorry
net
of
maybe
and
perhaps
the
great
winds
came
and
took
them
up
into
themselves
earth
fire
and
water
some
french
writer
that
i
read
when
i
was
a
boy
said
that
the
desert
went
into
the
heart
of
the
jews
in
their
wanderings
and
made
them
what
they
are
i
can
not
remember
by
what
argument
he
proved
them
to
be
even
yet
the
indestructible
children
of
earth
but
it
may
well
be
that
the
elements
have
their
children
if
we
knew
the
fire
worshippers
better
we
might
find
that
their
centuries
of
pious
observance
have
been
rewarded
and
that
the
fire
has
given
them
a
little
of
its
nature
and
i
am
certain
that
the
water
the
water
of
the
seas
and
of
lakes
and
of
mist
and
rain
has
all
but
made
the
irish
after
its
image
images
form
themselves
in
our
minds
perpetually
as
if
they
were
reflected
in
some
pool
we
gave
ourselves
up
in
old
times
to
mythology
and
saw
the
gods
everywhere
we
talked
to
them
face
to
face
and
the
stories
of
that
communion
are
so
many
that
i
think
they
outnumber
all
the
like
stories
of
all
the
rest
of
europe
even
our
country
people
speak
with
the
dead
and
with
some
who
perhaps
have
never
died
as
we
understand
death
and
even
our
educated
people
pass
without
great
difficulty
into
the
condition
of
quiet
that
is
the
condition
of
vision
we
can
make
our
minds
so
like
still
water
that
beings
gather
about
us
that
they
may
see
it
may
be
their
own
images
and
so
live
for
a
moment
with
a
clearer
perhaps
even
with
a
fiercer
life
because
of
our
quiet
did
not
the
wise
porphyry
think
that
all
souls
come
to
be
born
because
of
water
and
that
even
the
generation
of
images
in
the
mind
is
from
water
the
old
town
i
fell
one
night
some
fifteen
years
ago
into
what
seemed
the
power
of
faery
i
had
gone
with
a
young
man
and
his
sister
friends
and
relations
of
my
own
to
pick
stories
out
of
an
old
countryman
and
we
were
coming
home
talking
over
what
he
had
told
us
it
was
dark
and
our
imaginations
were
excited
by
his
stories
of
apparitions
and
this
may
have
brought
us
unknown
to
us
to
the
threshold
between
sleeping
and
waking
where
sphinxes
and
chimaeras
sit
and
where
there
are
always
murmurings
and
whisperings
i
can
not
think
that
what
we
saw
was
an
imagination
of
the
waking
mind
we
had
come
under
some
trees
that
made
the
road
very
dark
when
the
girl
saw
a
bright
light
moving
slowly
across
the
road
her
brother
and
myself
saw
nothing
and
did
not
see
anything
until
we
had
walked
for
about
along
the
edge
of
the
river
and
down
a
narrow
lane
to
some
fields
where
there
was
a
ruined
church
covered
with
ivy
and
the
foundations
of
what
was
called
the
old
town
which
had
been
burned
down
it
was
said
in
day
we
had
stood
for
some
few
minutes
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
looking
over
the
fields
full
of
stones
and
brambles
and
when
i
saw
a
small
bright
light
on
the
horizon
as
it
seemed
mounting
up
slowly
towards
the
sky
then
we
saw
other
faint
lights
for
a
minute
or
two
and
at
last
a
bright
flame
like
the
flame
of
a
torch
moving
rapidly
over
the
river
we
saw
it
all
in
such
a
dream
and
it
seems
all
so
unreal
that
i
have
never
written
of
it
until
now
and
hardly
ever
spoken
of
it
and
even
when
thinking
because
of
some
unreasoning
impulse
i
have
avoided
giving
it
weight
in
the
argument
perhaps
i
have
felt
that
my
recollections
of
things
seen
when
the
sense
of
reality
was
weakened
must
be
untrustworthy
a
few
months
ago
however
i
talked
it
over
with
my
two
friends
and
compared
their
somewhat
meagre
recollections
with
my
own
that
sense
of
unreality
was
all
the
more
wonderful
because
the
next
day
i
heard
sounds
as
unaccountable
as
were
those
lights
and
without
any
emotion
of
unreality
and
i
remember
them
with
perfect
distinctness
and
confidence
the
girl
was
sitting
reading
under
a
large
mirror
and
i
was
reading
and
writing
a
couple
of
yards
away
when
i
heard
a
sound
as
if
a
shower
of
peas
had
been
thrown
against
the
mirror
and
while
i
was
looking
at
it
i
heard
the
sound
again
and
presently
while
i
was
alone
in
the
room
i
heard
a
sound
as
if
something
much
bigger
than
a
pea
had
struck
the
wainscoting
beside
my
head
and
after
that
for
some
days
came
other
sights
and
sounds
not
to
me
but
to
the
girl
her
brother
and
the
servants
now
it
was
a
bright
light
now
it
was
letters
of
fire
that
vanished
before
they
could
be
read
now
it
was
a
heavy
foot
moving
about
in
the
seemingly
empty
house
one
wonders
whether
creatures
who
live
the
country
people
believe
wherever
men
and
women
have
lived
in
earlier
times
followed
us
from
the
ruins
of
the
old
town
or
did
they
come
from
the
banks
of
the
river
by
the
trees
where
the
first
light
had
shone
for
a
moment
the
man
and
his
boots
there
was
a
doubter
in
donegal
and
he
would
not
hear
of
ghosts
or
sheogues
and
there
was
a
house
in
donegal
that
had
been
haunted
as
long
as
man
could
remember
and
this
is
the
story
of
how
the
house
got
the
better
of
the
man
the
man
came
into
the
house
and
lighted
a
fire
in
the
room
under
the
haunted
one
and
took
off
his
boots
and
set
them
on
the
hearth
and
stretched
out
his
feet
and
warmed
him
self
for
a
time
he
prospered
in
his
unbelief
but
a
little
while
after
the
night
had
fallen
and
everything
had
got
very
dark
one
of
his
boots
began
to
move
it
got
up
off
the
floor
and
gave
a
kind
of
slow
jump
towards
the
door
and
then
the
other
boot
did
the
same
and
after
that
the
first
boot
jumped
again
and
thereupon
it
struck
the
man
that
an
invisible
being
had
got
into
his
boots
and
was
now
going
away
in
them
when
the
boots
reached
the
door
they
went
slowly
and
then
the
man
heard
them
go
tramp
tramp
round
the
haunted
room
over
his
head
a
few
minutes
passed
and
he
could
hear
them
again
upon
the
stairs
and
after
that
in
the
passage
outside
and
then
one
of
them
came
in
at
the
door
and
the
other
gave
a
jump
past
it
and
came
in
too
they
jumped
along
towards
him
and
then
one
got
up
and
hit
him
and
afterwards
the
other
hit
him
and
then
again
the
first
hit
him
and
so
on
until
they
drove
him
out
of
the
room
and
finally
out
of
the
house
in
this
way
he
was
kicked
out
by
his
own
boots
and
donegal
was
avenged
upon
its
doubter
it
is
not
recorded
whether
the
invisible
being
was
a
ghost
or
one
of
the
sidhe
but
the
fantastic
nature
of
the
vengeance
is
like
the
work
of
the
sidhe
who
live
in
the
heart
of
fantasy
a
coward
one
day
i
was
at
the
house
of
my
friend
the
strong
farmer
who
lives
beyond
ben
bulben
and
cope
mountain
and
met
there
a
young
lad
who
seemed
to
be
disliked
by
the
two
daughters
i
asked
why
they
disliked
him
and
was
told
he
was
a
coward
this
interested
me
for
some
whom
robust
children
of
nature
take
to
be
cowards
are
but
men
and
women
with
a
nervous
system
too
finely
made
for
their
life
and
work
i
looked
at
the
lad
but
no
that
face
and
strong
body
had
nothing
of
undue
sensibility
after
a
little
he
told
me
his
story
he
had
lived
a
wild
and
reckless
life
until
one
day
two
years
before
he
was
coming
home
late
at
night
and
suddenly
fell
himself
sinking
in
as
it
were
upon
the
ghostly
world
for
a
moment
he
saw
the
face
of
a
dead
brother
rise
up
before
him
and
then
he
turned
and
ran
he
did
not
stop
till
he
came
to
a
cottage
nearly
a
mile
down
the
road
he
flung
himself
against
the
door
with
so
much
of
violence
that
he
broke
the
thick
wooden
bolt
and
fell
upon
the
floor
from
that
day
he
gave
up
his
wild
life
but
was
a
hopeless
coward
nothing
could
ever
bring
him
to
look
either
by
day
or
night
upon
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
the
face
and
he
often
went
two
miles
round
to
avoid
it
nor
could
he
said
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
country
persuade
him
to
see
her
home
after
a
party
if
he
were
alone
he
feared
everything
for
he
had
looked
at
the
face
no
man
can
see
imponderable
face
of
a
spirit
the
three
and
the
evil
faeries
in
the
dim
kingdom
there
is
a
great
abundance
of
all
excellent
things
there
is
more
love
there
than
upon
the
earth
there
is
more
dancing
there
than
upon
the
earth
and
there
is
more
treasure
there
than
upon
the
earth
in
the
beginning
the
earth
was
perhaps
made
to
fulfil
the
desire
of
man
but
now
it
has
got
old
and
fallen
into
decay
what
wonder
if
we
try
and
pilfer
the
treasures
of
that
other
kingdom
a
friend
was
once
at
a
village
near
sleive
league
one
day
he
was
straying
about
a
rath
called
cashel
nore
a
man
with
a
haggard
face
and
unkempt
hair
and
clothes
falling
in
pieces
came
into
the
rath
and
began
digging
my
friend
turned
to
a
peasant
who
was
working
near
and
asked
who
the
man
was
that
is
the
third
was
the
answer
a
few
days
after
he
learned
this
story
a
great
quantity
of
treasure
had
been
buried
in
the
rath
in
pagan
times
and
a
number
of
evil
faeries
set
to
guard
it
but
some
day
it
was
to
be
found
and
belong
to
the
family
of
the
before
that
day
three
must
find
it
and
die
two
had
already
done
so
the
first
had
dug
and
dug
until
at
last
he
had
got
a
glimpse
of
the
stone
coffin
that
contained
it
but
immediately
a
thing
like
a
huge
hairy
dog
came
down
the
mountain
and
tore
him
to
pieces
the
next
morning
the
treasure
had
again
vanished
deep
into
the
earth
the
second
came
and
dug
and
dug
until
he
found
the
coffer
and
lifted
the
lid
and
saw
the
gold
shining
within
he
saw
some
horrible
sight
the
next
moment
and
went
raving
mad
and
soon
died
the
treasure
again
sank
out
of
sight
the
third
is
now
digging
he
believes
that
he
will
die
in
some
terrible
way
the
moment
he
finds
the
treasure
but
that
the
spell
will
be
broken
and
the
family
made
rich
for
ever
as
they
were
of
old
a
peasant
of
the
neighbourhood
once
saw
the
treasure
he
found
the
of
a
hare
lying
on
the
grass
he
took
it
up
there
was
a
hole
in
it
he
looked
through
the
hole
and
saw
the
gold
heaped
up
under
the
ground
he
hurried
home
to
bring
a
spade
but
when
he
got
to
the
rath
again
he
could
not
find
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
it
drumcliff
and
rosses
drumcliff
and
rosses
were
are
and
ever
shall
be
please
heaven
places
of
unearthly
resort
i
have
lived
near
by
them
and
in
them
time
after
time
and
have
gathered
thus
many
a
crumb
of
faery
lore
drumcliff
is
a
wide
green
valley
lying
at
the
foot
of
ben
bulben
the
mountain
in
whose
side
the
square
white
door
swings
open
at
nightfall
to
loose
the
faery
riders
on
the
world
the
great
columba
himself
the
builder
of
many
of
the
old
ruins
in
the
valley
climbed
the
mountains
on
one
notable
day
to
get
near
heaven
with
his
prayers
rosses
is
a
little
sandy
plain
covered
with
short
grass
like
a
green
tablecloth
and
lying
in
the
foam
midway
between
the
round
knocknarea
and
ben
bulben
famous
for
hawks
but
for
benbulben
and
knocknarea
many
a
poor
sailor
be
cast
away
as
the
rhyme
goes
at
the
northern
corner
of
rosses
is
a
little
promontory
of
sand
and
rocks
and
grass
a
mournful
haunted
place
no
wise
peasant
would
fall
asleep
under
its
low
cliff
for
he
who
sleeps
here
may
wake
silly
the
good
people
having
carried
off
his
soul
there
is
no
more
ready
shortcut
to
the
dim
kingdom
than
this
plovery
headland
for
covered
and
smothered
now
from
sight
by
mounds
of
sand
a
long
cave
goes
thither
full
of
gold
and
silver
and
the
most
beautiful
parlours
and
once
before
the
sand
covered
it
a
dog
strayed
in
and
was
heard
yelping
helplessly
deep
underground
in
a
fort
far
inland
these
forts
or
raths
made
before
modern
history
had
begun
cover
all
rosses
and
all
columkille
the
one
where
the
dog
yelped
has
like
most
others
an
underground
beehive
chamber
in
the
midst
once
when
i
was
poking
about
there
an
unusually
intelligent
and
reading
peasant
who
had
come
with
me
and
waited
outside
knelt
down
by
the
opening
and
whispered
in
a
timid
voice
are
you
all
right
sir
i
had
been
some
little
while
underground
and
he
feared
i
had
been
carried
off
like
the
dog
no
wonder
he
was
afraid
for
the
fort
has
long
been
circled
by
boding
rumours
it
is
on
the
ridge
of
a
small
hill
on
whose
northern
slope
lie
a
few
stray
cottages
one
night
a
farmer
young
son
came
from
one
of
them
and
saw
the
fort
all
flaming
and
ran
towards
it
but
the
glamour
fell
on
him
and
he
sprang
on
to
a
fence
and
commenced
beating
it
with
a
stick
for
he
imagined
the
fence
was
a
horse
and
that
all
night
long
he
went
on
the
most
wonderful
ride
through
the
country
in
the
morning
he
was
still
beating
his
fence
and
they
carried
him
home
where
he
remained
a
simpleton
for
three
years
before
he
came
to
himself
again
a
little
later
a
farmer
tried
to
level
the
fort
his
cows
and
horses
died
and
an
manner
of
trouble
overtook
him
and
finally
he
himself
was
led
home
and
left
useless
with
his
head
on
his
knees
by
the
fire
to
the
day
of
his
death
a
few
hundred
yards
southwards
of
the
northern
angle
of
rosses
is
another
angle
having
also
its
cave
though
this
one
is
not
covered
with
sand
about
twenty
years
ago
a
brig
was
wrecked
near
by
and
three
or
four
fishermen
were
put
to
watch
the
deserted
hulk
through
the
darkness
at
midnight
they
saw
sitting
on
a
stone
at
the
cave
mouth
two
fiddlers
fiddling
with
all
their
might
the
men
fled
a
great
crowd
of
villagers
rushed
down
to
the
cave
to
see
the
fiddlers
but
the
creatures
had
gone
to
the
wise
peasant
the
green
hills
and
woods
round
him
are
full
of
mystery
when
the
aged
countrywoman
stands
at
her
door
in
the
evening
and
in
her
own
words
looks
at
the
mountains
and
thinks
of
the
goodness
of
god
god
is
all
the
nearer
because
the
pagan
powers
are
not
far
because
northward
in
ben
bulben
famous
for
hawks
the
white
square
door
swings
open
at
sundown
and
those
wild
unchristian
riders
rush
forth
upon
the
fields
while
southward
the
white
lady
who
is
doubtless
maive
herself
wanders
under
the
broad
cloud
nightcap
of
knocknarea
how
may
she
doubt
these
things
even
though
the
priest
shakes
his
head
at
her
did
not
a
no
long
while
since
see
the
white
lady
she
passed
so
close
that
the
skirt
of
her
dress
touched
him
he
fell
down
and
was
dead
three
days
but
this
is
merely
the
small
gossip
of
faerydom
the
little
stitches
that
join
this
world
and
the
other
one
night
as
i
sat
eating
h
her
husband
told
me
a
longish
story
much
the
best
of
all
i
heard
in
rosses
many
a
poor
man
from
fin
to
our
own
days
has
had
some
such
adventure
to
tell
of
for
those
creatures
the
good
people
love
to
repeat
themselves
at
any
rate
the
do
in
the
times
when
we
used
to
travel
by
the
canal
he
said
i
was
coming
down
from
dublin
when
we
came
to
mullingar
the
canal
ended
and
i
began
to
walk
and
stiff
and
fatigued
i
was
after
the
slowness
i
had
some
friends
with
me
and
now
and
then
we
walked
now
and
then
we
rode
in
a
cart
so
on
till
we
saw
some
girls
milking
cows
and
stopped
to
joke
with
them
after
a
while
we
asked
them
for
a
drink
of
milk
have
nothing
to
put
it
in
here
they
said
come
to
the
house
with
us
we
went
home
with
them
and
sat
round
the
fire
talking
after
a
while
the
others
went
and
left
me
loath
to
stir
from
the
good
fire
i
asked
the
girls
for
something
to
eat
there
was
a
pot
on
the
fire
and
they
took
the
meat
out
and
put
it
on
a
plate
and
told
me
to
eat
only
the
meat
that
came
off
the
head
when
i
had
eaten
the
girls
went
out
and
i
did
not
see
them
again
it
grew
darker
and
darker
and
there
i
still
sat
loath
as
ever
to
leave
the
good
fire
and
after
a
while
two
men
came
in
carrying
between
them
a
corpse
when
i
saw
them
coming
i
hid
behind
the
door
says
one
to
the
other
putting
the
corpse
on
the
spit
turn
the
spit
says
the
other
h
come
out
of
that
and
turn
the
meat
i
came
out
all
of
a
tremble
and
began
turning
the
spit
h
says
the
one
who
spoke
first
you
let
it
burn
we
have
to
put
you
on
the
spit
instead
and
on
that
they
went
out
i
sat
there
trembling
and
turning
the
corpse
till
towards
midnight
the
men
came
again
and
the
one
said
it
was
burnt
and
the
other
said
it
was
done
right
but
having
fallen
out
over
it
they
both
said
they
would
do
me
no
harm
that
time
and
sitting
by
the
fire
one
of
them
cried
out
h
can
you
tell
me
a
story
a
one
said
i
on
which
he
caught
me
by
the
shoulder
and
put
me
out
like
a
shot
it
was
a
wild
blowing
night
never
in
all
my
born
days
did
i
see
such
a
darkest
night
that
ever
came
out
of
the
heavens
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
for
the
life
of
me
so
when
one
of
the
men
came
after
me
and
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
with
a
h
can
you
tell
a
story
now
can
says
i
in
he
brought
me
and
putting
me
by
the
fire
says
have
no
story
but
the
one
says
i
i
was
sitting
here
and
you
two
men
brought
in
a
corpse
and
put
it
on
the
spit
and
set
me
turning
it
will
do
says
he
may
go
in
there
and
lie
down
on
the
bed
and
i
went
nothing
loath
and
in
the
morning
where
was
i
but
in
the
middle
of
a
green
field
drumcliff
is
a
great
place
for
omens
before
a
prosperous
fishing
season
a
appears
in
the
midst
of
a
and
at
a
place
called
columkille
strand
a
place
of
marsh
and
mire
an
ancient
boat
with
columba
himself
comes
floating
in
from
sea
on
a
moonlight
night
a
portent
of
a
brave
harvesting
they
have
their
dread
portents
too
some
few
seasons
ago
a
fisherman
saw
far
on
the
horizon
renowned
hy
brazel
where
he
who
touches
shall
find
no
more
labour
or
care
nor
cynic
laughter
but
shall
go
walking
about
under
shadiest
boscage
and
enjoy
the
conversation
of
cuchullin
and
his
heroes
a
vision
of
hy
brazel
forebodes
national
troubles
drumcliff
and
rosses
are
chokeful
of
ghosts
by
bog
road
rath
hillside
they
gather
in
all
shapes
headless
women
men
in
armour
shadow
hares
hounds
whistling
seals
and
so
on
a
whistling
seal
sank
a
ship
the
other
day
at
drumcliff
there
is
a
very
ancient
graveyard
the
annals
of
the
four
masters
have
this
verse
about
a
soldier
named
denadhach
who
died
in
a
pious
soldier
of
the
race
of
con
lies
under
hazel
crosses
at
drumcliff
not
very
long
ago
an
old
woman
turning
to
go
into
the
churchyard
at
night
to
pray
saw
standing
before
her
a
man
in
armour
who
asked
her
where
she
was
going
it
was
the
pious
soldier
of
the
race
of
con
says
local
wisdom
still
keeping
watch
with
his
ancient
piety
over
the
graveyard
again
the
custom
is
still
common
hereabouts
of
sprinkling
the
doorstep
with
the
blood
of
a
chicken
on
the
death
of
a
very
young
child
thus
as
belief
is
drawing
into
the
blood
the
evil
spirits
from
the
too
weak
soul
blood
is
a
great
gatherer
of
evil
spirits
to
cut
your
hand
on
a
stone
on
going
into
a
fort
is
said
to
be
very
dangerous
there
is
no
more
curious
ghost
in
drumcliff
or
rosses
than
the
ghost
there
is
a
bush
behind
a
house
in
a
village
that
i
know
well
for
excellent
reasons
i
do
not
say
whether
in
drumcliff
or
rosses
or
on
the
slope
of
ben
bulben
or
even
on
the
plain
round
knocknarea
there
is
a
history
concerning
the
house
and
the
bush
a
man
once
lived
there
who
found
on
the
quay
of
sligo
a
package
containing
three
hundred
pounds
in
notes
it
was
dropped
by
a
foreign
sea
captain
this
my
man
knew
but
said
nothing
it
was
money
for
freight
and
the
sea
captain
not
daring
to
face
his
owners
committed
suicide
in
shortly
afterwards
my
man
died
his
soul
could
not
rest
at
any
rate
strange
sounds
were
heard
round
his
house
though
that
had
grown
and
prospered
since
the
freight
money
the
wife
was
often
seen
by
those
still
alive
out
in
the
garden
praying
at
the
bush
i
have
spoken
of
for
the
shade
of
the
dead
man
appeared
there
at
times
the
bush
remains
to
this
day
once
portion
of
a
hedge
it
now
stands
by
itself
for
no
one
dare
put
spade
or
about
it
as
to
the
strange
sounds
and
voices
they
did
not
cease
till
a
few
years
ago
when
during
some
repairs
a
snipe
flew
out
of
the
solid
plaster
and
away
the
troubled
ghost
say
the
neighbours
of
the
was
at
last
dislodged
my
forebears
and
relations
have
lived
near
rosses
and
drumcliff
these
many
years
a
few
miles
northward
i
am
wholly
a
stranger
and
can
find
nothing
when
i
ask
for
stories
of
the
faeries
my
answer
is
some
such
as
was
given
me
by
a
woman
who
lives
near
a
white
stone
fort
one
of
the
few
stone
ones
in
ireland
under
the
seaward
angle
of
ben
bulben
they
always
mind
their
own
affairs
and
i
always
mind
mine
for
it
is
dangerous
to
talk
of
the
creatures
only
friendship
for
yourself
or
knowledge
of
your
forebears
will
loosen
these
cautious
tongues
my
friend
the
sweet
i
give
no
more
than
his
irish
name
for
fear
of
gaugers
has
the
science
of
unpacking
the
stubbornest
heart
but
then
he
supplies
the
with
grain
from
his
own
fields
besides
he
is
descended
from
a
noted
gaelic
magician
who
raised
the
dhoul
in
great
eliza
century
and
he
has
a
kind
of
prescriptive
right
to
hear
tell
of
all
kind
of
creatures
they
are
almost
relations
of
his
if
all
people
say
concerning
the
parentage
of
magicians
be
true
the
thick
skull
of
the
fortunate
i
once
a
number
of
icelandic
peasantry
found
a
very
thick
skull
in
the
cemetery
where
the
poet
egil
was
buried
its
great
thickness
made
them
feel
certain
it
was
the
skull
of
a
great
man
doubtless
of
egil
himself
to
be
doubly
sure
they
put
it
on
a
wall
and
hit
it
hard
blows
with
a
hammer
it
got
white
where
the
blows
fell
but
did
not
break
and
they
were
convinced
that
it
was
in
truth
the
skull
of
the
poet
and
worthy
of
every
honour
in
ireland
we
have
much
kinship
with
the
icelanders
or
danes
as
we
call
them
and
all
other
dwellers
in
the
scandinavian
countries
in
some
of
our
mountainous
and
barren
places
and
in
our
seaboard
villages
we
still
test
each
other
in
much
the
same
way
the
icelanders
tested
the
head
of
egil
we
may
have
acquired
the
custom
from
those
ancient
danish
pirates
whose
descendants
the
people
of
rosses
tell
me
still
remember
every
field
and
hillock
in
ireland
which
once
belonged
to
their
forebears
and
are
able
to
describe
rosses
itself
as
well
as
any
native
there
is
one
seaboard
district
known
as
roughley
where
the
men
are
never
known
to
shave
or
trim
their
wild
red
beards
and
where
there
is
a
fight
ever
on
foot
i
have
seen
them
at
a
fall
foul
of
each
other
and
after
much
loud
gaelic
strike
each
other
with
oars
the
first
boat
had
gone
aground
and
by
dint
of
hitting
out
with
the
long
oars
kept
the
second
boat
from
passing
only
to
give
the
victory
to
the
third
one
day
the
sligo
people
say
a
man
from
roughley
was
tried
in
sligo
for
breaking
a
skull
in
a
row
and
made
the
defence
not
unknown
in
ireland
that
some
heads
are
so
thin
you
can
not
be
responsible
for
them
having
turned
with
a
look
of
passionate
contempt
towards
the
solicitor
who
was
prosecuting
and
cried
that
little
fellow
skull
if
ye
were
to
hit
it
would
go
like
an
he
beamed
upon
the
judge
and
said
in
a
wheedling
voice
but
a
man
might
wallop
away
at
your
lordship
for
a
fortnight
ii
i
wrote
all
this
years
ago
out
of
what
were
even
then
old
memories
i
was
in
roughley
the
other
day
and
found
it
much
like
other
desolate
places
i
may
have
been
thinking
of
moughorow
a
much
wilder
place
for
the
memories
of
one
childhood
are
brittle
things
to
lean
upon
the
religion
of
a
sailor
a
sea
captain
when
he
stands
upon
the
bridge
or
looks
out
from
his
thinks
much
about
god
and
about
the
world
away
in
the
valley
yonder
among
the
corn
and
the
poppies
men
may
well
forget
all
things
except
the
warmth
of
the
sun
upon
the
face
and
the
kind
shadow
under
the
hedge
but
he
who
journeys
through
storm
and
darkness
must
needs
think
and
think
one
july
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
took
my
supper
with
a
captain
moran
on
board
the
margaret
that
had
put
into
a
western
river
from
i
know
not
where
i
found
him
a
man
of
many
notions
all
flavoured
with
his
personality
as
is
the
way
with
sailors
he
talked
in
his
queer
sea
manner
of
god
and
the
world
and
up
through
all
his
words
broke
the
hard
energy
of
his
calling
sur
said
he
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
the
sea
captain
prayer
no
said
i
what
is
it
it
is
he
replied
lord
give
me
a
stiff
upper
lip
and
what
does
that
mean
it
means
he
said
that
when
they
come
to
me
some
night
and
wake
me
up
and
say
we
going
down
that
i
wo
make
a
fool
meself
why
sur
we
war
in
mid
atlantic
and
i
standin
on
the
bridge
when
the
third
mate
comes
up
to
me
looking
mortial
bad
says
he
all
up
with
us
says
i
you
know
when
you
joined
that
a
certain
percentage
go
down
every
year
sur
says
he
and
says
i
you
paid
to
go
down
sur
says
he
and
says
i
go
down
like
a
man
and
be
damned
to
you
concerning
the
nearness
together
of
heaven
earth
and
purgatory
in
ireland
this
world
and
the
world
we
go
to
after
death
are
not
far
apart
i
have
heard
of
a
ghost
that
was
many
years
in
a
tree
and
many
years
in
the
archway
of
a
bridge
and
my
old
mayo
woman
says
there
is
a
bush
up
at
my
own
place
and
the
people
do
be
saying
that
there
are
two
souls
doing
their
penance
under
it
when
the
wind
blows
one
way
the
one
has
shelter
and
when
it
blows
from
the
north
the
other
has
the
shelter
it
is
twisted
over
with
the
way
they
be
rooting
under
it
for
shelter
i
do
believe
it
but
there
is
many
a
one
would
not
pass
by
it
at
night
indeed
there
are
times
when
the
worlds
are
so
near
together
that
it
seems
as
if
our
earthly
chattels
were
no
more
than
the
shadows
of
things
beyond
a
lady
i
knew
once
saw
a
village
child
running
about
with
a
long
trailing
petticoat
upon
her
and
asked
the
creature
why
she
did
not
have
it
cut
short
it
was
my
grandmother
said
the
child
would
you
have
her
going
about
yonder
with
her
petticoat
up
to
her
knees
and
she
dead
but
four
days
i
have
read
a
story
of
a
woman
whose
ghost
haunted
her
people
because
they
had
made
her
so
short
that
the
fires
of
purgatory
burned
her
knees
the
peasantry
expect
to
have
beyond
the
grave
houses
much
like
their
earthly
homes
only
there
the
thatch
will
never
grow
leaky
nor
the
white
walls
lose
their
lustre
nor
shall
the
dairy
be
at
any
time
empty
of
good
milk
and
butter
but
now
and
then
a
landlord
or
an
agent
or
a
gauger
will
go
by
begging
his
bread
to
show
how
god
divides
the
righteous
from
the
unrighteous
and
the
eaters
of
precious
stones
sometimes
when
i
have
been
shut
off
from
common
interests
and
have
for
a
little
forgotten
to
be
restless
i
get
waking
dreams
now
faint
and
now
vivid
and
like
the
material
world
under
my
feet
whether
they
be
faint
or
vivid
they
are
ever
beyond
the
power
of
my
will
to
alter
in
any
way
they
have
their
own
will
and
sweep
hither
and
thither
and
change
according
to
its
commands
one
day
i
saw
faintly
an
immense
pit
of
blackness
round
which
went
a
circular
parapet
and
on
this
parapet
sat
innumerable
apes
eating
precious
stones
out
of
the
palms
of
their
hands
the
stones
glittered
green
and
crimson
and
the
apes
devoured
them
with
an
insatiable
hunger
i
knew
that
i
saw
the
celtic
hell
and
my
own
hell
the
hell
of
the
artist
and
that
all
who
sought
after
beautiful
and
wonderful
things
with
too
avid
a
thirst
lost
peace
and
form
and
became
shapeless
and
common
i
have
seen
into
other
people
hells
also
and
saw
in
one
an
infernal
peter
who
had
a
black
face
and
white
lips
and
who
weighed
on
a
curious
double
scales
not
only
the
evil
deeds
committed
but
the
good
deeds
left
undone
of
certain
invisible
shades
i
could
see
the
scales
go
up
and
down
but
i
could
not
see
the
shades
who
were
i
knew
crowding
about
him
i
saw
on
another
occasion
a
quantity
of
demons
of
all
kinds
of
shapes
and
sitting
about
a
black
pit
such
as
that
in
my
own
hell
and
looking
at
a
moon
like
reflection
of
the
heavens
which
shone
up
from
the
depths
of
the
pit
our
lady
of
the
hills
when
we
were
children
we
did
not
say
at
such
a
distance
from
the
office
or
so
far
from
the
butcher
or
the
grocer
but
measured
things
by
the
covered
well
in
the
wood
or
by
the
burrow
of
the
fox
in
the
hill
we
belonged
then
to
god
and
to
his
works
and
to
things
come
down
from
the
ancient
days
we
would
not
have
been
greatly
surprised
had
we
met
the
shining
feet
of
an
angel
among
the
white
mushrooms
upon
the
mountains
for
we
knew
in
those
days
immense
despair
unfathomed
love
every
eternal
mood
but
now
the
is
about
our
feet
a
few
miles
eastward
of
lough
gill
a
young
protestant
girl
who
was
both
pretty
herself
and
prettily
dressed
in
blue
and
white
wandered
up
among
those
mountain
mushrooms
and
i
have
a
letter
of
hers
telling
how
she
met
a
troop
of
children
and
became
a
portion
of
their
dream
when
they
first
saw
her
they
threw
themselves
face
down
in
a
bed
of
rushes
as
if
in
a
great
fear
but
after
a
little
other
children
came
about
them
and
they
got
up
and
followed
her
almost
bravely
she
noticed
their
fear
and
presently
stood
still
and
held
out
her
arms
a
little
girl
threw
herself
into
them
with
the
cry
ah
you
are
the
virgin
out
o
the
picture
no
said
another
coming
near
also
she
is
a
sky
faery
for
she
has
the
colour
of
the
sky
no
said
a
third
she
is
the
faery
out
of
the
foxglove
grown
big
the
other
children
however
would
have
it
that
she
was
indeed
the
virgin
for
she
wore
the
colours
her
good
protestant
heart
was
greatly
troubled
and
she
got
the
children
to
sit
down
about
her
and
tried
to
explain
who
she
was
but
they
would
have
none
of
her
explanation
finding
explanation
of
no
avail
she
asked
had
they
ever
heard
of
christ
yes
said
one
but
we
do
not
like
him
for
he
would
kill
us
if
it
were
not
for
the
virgin
tell
him
to
be
good
to
me
whispered
another
into
her
ear
we
would
not
let
me
near
him
for
dad
says
i
am
a
divil
burst
out
a
third
she
talked
to
them
a
long
time
about
christ
and
the
apostles
but
was
finally
interrupted
by
an
elderly
woman
with
a
stick
who
taking
her
to
be
some
adventurous
hunter
for
converts
drove
the
children
away
despite
their
explanation
that
here
was
the
great
queen
of
heaven
come
to
walk
upon
the
mountain
and
be
kind
to
them
when
the
children
had
gone
she
went
on
her
way
and
had
walked
about
when
the
child
who
was
called
a
divil
jumped
down
from
the
high
ditch
by
the
lane
and
said
she
would
believe
her
an
ordinary
lady
if
she
had
two
skirts
for
ladies
always
had
two
skirts
the
two
skirts
were
shown
and
the
child
went
away
crestfallen
but
a
few
minutes
later
jumped
down
again
from
the
ditch
and
cried
angrily
dad
a
divil
mum
a
divil
and
i
a
divil
and
you
are
only
an
ordinary
lady
and
having
flung
a
handful
of
mud
and
pebbles
ran
away
sobbing
when
my
pretty
protestant
had
come
to
her
own
home
she
found
that
she
had
dropped
the
tassels
of
her
parasol
a
year
later
she
was
by
chance
upon
the
mountain
but
wearing
now
a
plain
black
dress
and
met
the
child
who
had
first
called
her
the
virgin
out
o
the
picture
and
saw
the
tassels
hanging
about
the
child
neck
and
said
i
am
the
lady
you
met
last
year
who
told
you
about
christ
no
you
are
not
no
you
are
not
no
you
are
not
was
the
passionate
reply
and
after
all
it
was
not
my
pretty
protestant
but
mary
star
of
the
sea
still
walking
in
sadness
and
in
beauty
upon
many
a
mountain
and
by
many
a
shore
who
cast
those
tassels
at
the
feet
of
the
child
it
is
indeed
fitting
that
man
pray
to
her
who
is
the
mother
of
peace
the
mother
of
dreams
and
the
mother
of
purity
to
leave
them
yet
a
little
hour
to
do
good
and
evil
in
and
to
watch
old
time
telling
the
rosary
of
the
stars
the
golden
age
a
while
ago
i
was
in
the
train
and
getting
near
sligo
the
last
time
i
had
been
there
something
was
troubling
me
and
i
had
longed
for
a
message
from
those
beings
or
bodiless
moods
or
whatever
they
be
who
inhabit
the
world
of
spirits
the
message
came
for
one
night
i
saw
with
blinding
distinctness
a
black
animal
half
weasel
half
dog
moving
along
the
top
of
a
stone
wall
and
presently
the
black
animal
vanished
and
from
the
other
side
came
a
white
dog
his
pink
flesh
shining
through
his
white
hair
and
all
in
a
blaze
of
light
and
i
remembered
a
pleasant
belief
about
two
faery
dogs
who
go
about
representing
day
and
night
good
and
evil
and
was
comforted
by
the
excellent
omen
but
now
i
longed
for
a
message
of
another
kind
and
chance
if
chance
there
is
brought
it
for
a
man
got
into
the
carriage
and
began
to
play
on
a
fiddle
made
apparently
of
an
old
and
though
i
am
quite
unmusical
the
sounds
filled
me
with
the
strangest
emotions
i
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
of
lamentation
out
of
the
golden
age
it
told
me
that
we
are
imperfect
incomplete
and
no
more
like
a
beautiful
woven
web
but
like
a
bundle
of
cords
knotted
together
and
flung
into
a
comer
it
said
that
the
world
was
once
all
perfect
and
kindly
and
that
still
the
kindly
and
perfect
world
existed
but
buried
like
a
mass
of
roses
under
many
spadefuls
of
earth
the
faeries
and
the
more
innocent
of
the
spirits
dwelt
within
it
and
lamented
over
our
fallen
world
in
the
lamentation
of
the
reeds
in
the
song
of
the
birds
in
the
moan
of
the
waves
and
in
the
sweet
cry
of
the
fiddle
it
said
that
with
us
the
beautiful
are
not
clever
and
the
clever
are
not
beautiful
and
that
the
best
of
our
moments
are
marred
by
a
little
vulgarity
or
by
a
out
of
sad
recollection
and
that
the
fiddle
must
ever
lament
about
it
all
it
said
that
if
only
they
who
live
in
the
golden
age
could
die
we
might
be
happy
for
the
sad
voices
would
be
still
but
alas
alas
they
must
sing
and
we
must
weep
until
the
eternal
gates
swing
open
we
were
now
getting
into
the
big
terminus
and
the
fiddler
put
away
his
old
and
held
out
his
hat
for
a
copper
and
then
opened
the
door
and
was
gone
a
remonstrance
with
scotsmen
for
having
soured
the
disposition
of
their
ghosts
and
faeries
not
only
in
ireland
is
faery
belief
still
extant
it
was
only
the
other
day
i
heard
of
a
scottish
farmer
who
believed
that
the
lake
in
front
of
his
house
was
haunted
by
a
he
was
afraid
of
it
and
dragged
the
lake
with
nets
and
then
tried
to
pump
it
empty
it
would
have
been
a
bad
thing
for
the
had
he
found
him
an
irish
peasant
would
have
long
since
come
to
terms
with
the
creature
for
in
ireland
there
is
something
of
timid
affection
between
men
and
spirits
they
only
each
other
in
reason
each
admits
the
other
side
to
have
feelings
there
are
points
beyond
which
neither
will
go
no
irish
peasant
would
treat
a
captured
faery
as
did
the
man
campbell
tells
of
he
caught
a
kelpie
and
tied
her
behind
him
on
his
horse
she
was
fierce
but
he
kept
her
quiet
by
driving
an
awl
and
a
needle
into
her
they
came
to
a
river
and
she
grew
very
restless
fearing
to
cross
the
water
again
he
drove
the
awl
and
needle
into
her
she
cried
out
pierce
me
with
the
awl
but
keep
that
slender
like
slave
the
needle
out
of
me
they
came
to
an
inn
he
turned
the
light
of
a
lantern
on
her
immediately
she
dropped
down
like
a
falling
star
and
changed
into
a
lump
of
jelly
she
was
dead
nor
would
they
treat
the
faeries
as
one
is
treated
in
an
old
highland
poem
a
faery
loved
a
little
child
who
used
to
cut
turf
at
the
side
of
a
faery
hill
every
day
the
faery
put
out
his
hand
from
the
hill
with
an
enchanted
knife
the
child
used
to
cut
the
turf
with
the
knife
it
did
not
take
long
the
knife
being
charmed
her
brothers
wondered
why
she
was
done
so
quickly
at
last
they
resolved
to
watch
and
find
out
who
helped
her
they
saw
the
small
hand
come
out
of
the
earth
and
the
little
child
take
from
it
the
knife
when
the
turf
was
all
cut
they
saw
her
make
three
taps
on
the
ground
with
the
handle
the
small
hand
came
out
of
the
hill
snatching
the
knife
from
the
child
they
cut
the
hand
off
with
a
blow
the
faery
was
never
again
seen
he
drew
his
bleeding
arm
into
the
earth
thinking
as
it
is
recorded
he
had
lost
his
hand
through
the
treachery
of
the
child
in
scotland
you
are
too
theological
too
gloomy
you
have
made
even
the
devil
religious
where
do
you
live
and
how
is
the
minister
he
said
to
the
witch
when
he
met
her
on
the
as
it
came
out
in
the
trial
you
have
burnt
all
the
witches
in
ireland
we
have
left
them
alone
to
be
sure
the
loyal
minority
knocked
out
the
eye
of
one
with
a
on
the
of
march
in
the
town
of
carrickfergus
but
then
the
loyal
minority
is
half
scottish
you
have
discovered
the
faeries
to
be
pagan
and
wicked
you
would
like
to
have
them
all
up
before
the
magistrate
in
ireland
warlike
mortals
have
gone
amongst
them
and
helped
them
in
their
battles
and
they
in
turn
have
taught
men
great
skill
with
herbs
and
permitted
some
few
to
hear
their
tunes
carolan
slept
upon
a
faery
rath
ever
after
their
tunes
ran
in
his
head
and
made
him
the
great
musician
he
was
in
scotland
you
have
denounced
them
from
the
pulpit
in
ireland
they
have
been
permitted
by
the
priests
to
consult
them
on
the
state
of
their
souls
unhappily
the
priests
have
decided
that
they
have
no
souls
that
they
will
dry
up
like
so
much
bright
vapour
at
the
last
day
but
more
in
sadness
than
in
anger
they
have
said
it
the
catholic
religion
likes
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
its
neighbours
these
two
different
ways
of
looking
at
things
have
influenced
in
each
country
the
whole
world
of
sprites
and
goblins
for
their
gay
and
graceful
doings
you
must
go
to
ireland
for
their
deeds
of
terror
to
scotland
our
irish
faery
terrors
have
about
them
something
of
believe
when
a
peasant
strays
into
an
enchanted
hovel
and
is
made
to
turn
a
corpse
all
night
on
a
spit
before
the
fire
we
do
not
feel
anxious
we
know
he
will
wake
in
the
midst
of
a
green
field
the
dew
on
his
old
coat
in
scotland
it
is
altogether
different
you
have
soured
the
naturally
excellent
disposition
of
ghosts
and
goblins
the
piper
of
the
hebrides
shouldered
his
pipes
and
marched
into
a
sea
cavern
playing
loudly
and
followed
by
his
dog
for
a
long
time
the
people
could
hear
the
pipes
he
must
have
gone
nearly
a
mile
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
struggle
then
the
piping
ceased
suddenly
some
time
went
by
and
then
his
dog
came
out
of
the
cavern
completely
flayed
too
weak
even
to
howl
nothing
else
ever
came
out
of
the
cavern
then
there
is
the
tale
of
the
man
who
dived
into
a
lake
where
treasure
was
thought
to
be
he
saw
a
great
coffer
of
iron
close
to
the
coffer
lay
a
monster
who
warned
him
to
return
whence
he
came
he
rose
to
the
surface
but
the
bystanders
when
they
heard
he
had
seen
the
treasure
persuaded
him
to
dive
again
he
dived
in
a
little
while
his
heart
and
liver
floated
up
reddening
the
water
no
man
ever
saw
the
rest
of
his
body
these
and
are
common
in
scottish
lore
we
have
them
too
but
take
them
much
less
dreadfully
our
tales
turn
all
their
doings
to
favour
and
to
prettiness
or
hopelessly
humorize
the
creatures
a
hole
in
the
sligo
river
is
haunted
by
one
of
these
monsters
he
is
ardently
believed
in
by
many
but
that
does
not
prevent
the
peasantry
playing
with
the
subject
and
surrounding
it
with
conscious
fantasies
when
i
was
a
small
boy
i
fished
one
day
for
congers
in
the
monster
hole
returning
home
a
great
eel
on
my
shoulder
his
head
flapping
down
in
front
his
tail
sweeping
the
ground
behind
i
met
a
fisherman
of
my
acquaintance
i
began
a
tale
of
an
immense
conger
three
times
larger
than
the
one
i
carried
that
had
broken
my
line
and
escaped
that
was
him
said
the
fisherman
did
you
ever
hear
how
he
made
my
brother
emigrate
my
brother
was
a
diver
you
know
and
grubbed
stones
for
the
harbour
board
one
day
the
beast
comes
up
to
him
and
says
are
you
after
sur
says
he
you
think
you
had
better
be
going
sur
says
he
and
that
why
my
brother
emigrated
the
people
said
it
was
because
he
got
poor
but
that
not
true
you
you
will
make
no
terms
with
the
spirits
of
fire
and
earth
and
air
and
water
you
have
made
the
darkness
your
enemy
we
we
exchange
civilities
with
the
world
beyond
war
when
there
was
a
rumour
of
war
with
france
a
while
ago
i
met
a
poor
sligo
woman
a
soldier
widow
that
i
know
and
i
read
her
a
sentence
out
of
a
letter
i
had
just
had
from
london
the
people
here
are
mad
for
war
but
france
seems
inclined
to
take
things
peacefully
or
some
like
sentence
her
mind
ran
a
good
deal
on
war
which
she
imagined
partly
from
what
she
had
heard
from
soldiers
and
partly
from
tradition
of
the
rebellion
of
but
the
word
london
doubled
her
interest
for
she
knew
there
were
a
great
many
people
in
london
and
she
herself
had
once
lived
in
a
congested
district
there
are
too
many
over
one
another
in
london
they
are
getting
tired
of
the
world
it
is
killed
they
want
to
be
it
will
be
no
matter
but
sure
the
french
want
nothing
but
peace
and
quietness
the
people
here
do
mind
the
war
coming
they
could
not
be
worse
than
they
are
they
may
as
well
die
soldierly
before
god
sure
they
will
get
quarters
in
heaven
then
she
began
to
say
that
it
would
be
a
hard
thing
to
see
children
tossed
about
on
bayonets
and
i
knew
her
mind
was
running
on
traditions
of
the
great
rebellion
she
said
presently
i
never
knew
a
man
that
was
in
a
battle
that
liked
to
speak
of
it
after
they
sooner
be
throwing
hay
down
from
a
hayrick
she
told
me
how
she
and
her
neighbours
used
to
be
sitting
over
the
fire
when
she
was
a
girl
talking
of
the
war
that
was
coming
and
now
she
was
afraid
it
was
coming
again
for
she
had
dreamed
that
all
the
bay
was
stranded
and
covered
with
seaweed
i
asked
her
if
it
was
in
the
fenian
times
that
she
had
been
so
much
afraid
of
war
coming
but
she
cried
out
never
had
i
such
fun
and
pleasure
as
in
the
fenian
times
i
was
in
a
house
where
some
of
the
officers
used
to
be
staying
and
in
the
daytime
i
would
be
walking
after
the
band
and
at
night
i
be
going
down
to
the
end
of
the
garden
watching
a
soldier
with
his
red
coat
on
him
drilling
the
fenians
in
the
field
behind
the
house
one
night
the
boys
tied
the
liver
of
an
old
horse
that
had
been
dead
three
weeks
to
the
knocker
and
i
found
it
when
i
opened
the
door
in
the
morning
and
presently
our
talk
of
war
shifted
as
it
had
a
way
of
doing
to
the
battle
of
the
black
pig
which
seems
to
her
a
battle
between
ireland
and
england
but
to
me
an
armageddon
which
shall
quench
all
things
in
the
ancestral
darkness
again
and
from
this
to
sayings
about
war
and
vengeance
do
you
know
she
said
what
the
curse
of
the
four
fathers
is
they
put
the
on
the
spear
and
somebody
said
to
them
will
be
cursed
in
the
fourth
generation
after
you
and
that
is
why
disease
or
anything
always
comes
in
the
fourth
generation
the
queen
and
the
fool
i
have
heard
one
hearne
a
who
is
on
the
border
of
clare
and
galway
say
that
in
every
household
of
faery
there
is
a
queen
and
a
fool
and
that
if
you
are
touched
by
either
you
never
recover
though
you
may
from
the
touch
of
any
other
in
faery
he
said
of
the
fool
that
he
was
maybe
the
wisest
of
all
and
spoke
of
him
as
dressed
like
one
of
the
mummers
that
used
to
be
going
about
the
country
since
then
a
friend
has
gathered
me
some
few
stories
of
him
and
i
have
heard
that
he
is
known
too
in
the
highlands
i
remember
seeing
a
long
lank
ragged
man
sitting
by
the
hearth
in
the
cottage
of
an
old
miller
not
far
from
where
i
am
now
writing
and
being
told
that
he
was
a
fool
and
i
find
from
the
stories
that
my
friend
has
gathered
that
he
is
believed
to
go
to
faery
in
his
sleep
but
whether
he
becomes
an
a
fool
of
the
forth
and
is
attached
to
a
household
there
i
can
not
tell
it
was
an
old
woman
that
i
know
well
and
who
has
been
in
faery
herself
that
spoke
of
him
she
said
there
are
fools
amongst
them
and
the
fools
we
see
like
that
amadan
of
ballylee
go
away
with
them
at
night
and
so
do
the
woman
fools
that
we
call
oinseachs
apes
a
woman
who
is
related
to
the
on
the
border
of
clare
and
who
can
cure
people
and
cattle
by
spells
said
there
are
some
cures
i
ca
do
i
ca
help
any
one
that
has
got
a
stroke
from
the
queen
or
the
fool
of
the
forth
i
knew
of
a
woman
that
saw
the
queen
one
time
and
she
looked
like
any
christian
i
never
heard
of
any
that
saw
the
fool
but
one
woman
that
was
walking
near
gort
and
she
called
out
the
fool
of
the
forth
coming
after
me
so
her
friends
that
were
with
her
called
out
though
they
could
see
nothing
and
i
suppose
he
went
away
at
that
for
she
got
no
harm
he
was
like
a
big
strong
man
she
said
and
half
naked
and
that
is
all
she
said
about
him
i
have
never
seen
any
myself
but
i
am
a
cousin
of
hearne
and
my
uncle
was
away
years
the
wife
of
the
old
miller
said
it
is
said
they
are
mostly
good
neighbours
but
the
stroke
of
the
fool
is
what
there
is
no
cure
for
any
one
that
gets
that
is
gone
the
we
call
him
and
an
old
woman
who
lives
in
the
bog
of
kiltartan
and
is
very
poor
said
it
is
true
enough
there
is
no
cure
for
the
stroke
of
the
there
was
an
old
man
i
knew
long
ago
he
had
a
tape
and
he
could
tell
what
diseases
you
had
with
measuring
you
and
he
knew
many
things
and
he
said
to
me
one
time
month
of
the
year
is
the
worst
and
i
said
month
of
may
of
course
is
not
he
said
the
month
of
june
for
that
the
month
that
the
amadan
gives
his
stroke
they
say
he
looks
like
any
other
man
but
he
leathan
wide
and
not
smart
i
knew
a
boy
one
time
got
a
great
fright
for
a
lamb
looked
over
the
wall
at
him
with
a
beard
on
it
and
he
knew
it
was
the
amadan
for
it
was
the
month
of
june
and
they
brought
him
to
that
man
i
was
telling
about
that
had
the
tape
and
when
he
saw
him
he
said
for
the
priest
and
get
a
mass
said
over
him
and
so
they
did
and
what
would
you
say
but
living
yet
and
has
a
family
a
certain
regan
said
the
other
sort
of
people
might
be
passing
you
close
here
and
they
might
touch
you
but
any
that
gets
the
touch
of
the
is
done
for
it
true
enough
that
it
in
the
month
of
june
he
most
likely
to
give
the
touch
i
knew
one
that
got
it
and
he
told
me
about
it
himself
he
was
a
boy
i
knew
well
and
he
told
me
that
one
night
a
gentleman
came
to
him
that
had
been
his
and
that
was
dead
and
he
told
him
to
come
along
with
him
for
he
wanted
him
to
fight
another
man
and
when
he
went
he
found
two
great
troops
of
them
and
the
other
troop
had
a
living
man
with
them
too
and
he
was
put
to
fight
him
and
they
had
a
great
fight
and
he
got
the
better
of
the
other
man
and
then
the
troop
on
his
side
gave
a
great
shout
and
he
was
left
home
again
but
about
three
years
after
that
he
was
cutting
bushes
in
a
wood
and
he
saw
the
amadan
coming
at
him
he
had
a
big
vessel
in
his
arms
and
it
was
shining
so
that
the
boy
could
see
nothing
else
but
he
put
it
behind
his
back
then
and
came
running
and
the
boy
said
he
looked
wild
and
wide
like
the
side
of
the
hill
and
the
boy
ran
and
he
threw
the
vessel
after
him
and
it
broke
with
a
great
noise
and
whatever
came
out
of
it
his
head
was
gone
there
and
then
he
lived
for
a
while
after
and
used
to
tell
us
many
things
but
his
wits
were
gone
he
thought
they
might
have
liked
him
to
beat
the
other
man
and
he
used
to
be
afraid
something
would
come
on
him
and
an
old
woman
in
a
galway
workhouse
who
had
some
little
knowledge
of
queen
maive
said
the
other
day
the
changes
his
shape
every
two
days
sometimes
he
comes
like
a
youngster
and
then
he
come
like
the
worst
of
beasts
trying
to
give
the
touch
he
used
to
be
i
heard
it
said
of
late
he
was
shot
but
i
think
myself
it
would
be
hard
to
shoot
him
i
knew
a
man
who
was
trying
to
bring
before
his
mind
eye
an
image
of
aengus
the
old
irish
god
of
love
and
poetry
and
ecstasy
who
changed
four
of
his
kisses
into
birds
and
suddenly
the
image
of
a
man
with
a
cap
and
bells
rushed
before
his
mind
eye
and
grew
vivid
and
spoke
and
called
itself
aengus
messenger
and
i
knew
another
man
a
truly
great
seer
who
saw
a
white
fool
in
a
visionary
garden
where
there
was
a
tree
with
peacocks
feathers
instead
of
leaves
and
flowers
that
opened
to
show
little
human
faces
when
the
white
fool
had
touched
them
with
his
coxcomb
and
he
saw
at
another
time
a
white
fool
sitting
by
a
pool
and
smiling
and
watching
the
images
of
many
fair
women
floating
up
from
the
pool
what
else
can
death
be
but
the
beginning
of
wisdom
and
power
and
beauty
and
foolishness
may
be
a
kind
of
death
i
can
not
think
it
wonderful
that
many
should
see
a
fool
with
a
shining
vessel
of
some
enchantment
or
wisdom
or
dream
too
powerful
for
mortal
brains
in
every
household
of
them
it
is
natural
too
that
there
should
be
a
queen
to
every
household
of
them
and
that
one
should
hear
little
of
their
kings
for
women
come
more
easily
than
men
to
that
wisdom
which
ancient
peoples
and
all
wild
peoples
even
now
think
the
only
wisdom
the
self
which
is
the
foundation
of
our
knowledge
is
broken
in
pieces
by
foolishness
and
is
forgotten
in
the
sudden
emotions
of
women
and
therefore
fools
may
get
and
women
do
get
of
a
certainty
glimpses
of
much
that
sanctity
finds
at
the
end
of
its
painful
journey
the
man
who
saw
the
white
fool
said
of
a
certain
woman
not
a
peasant
woman
if
i
had
her
power
of
vision
i
would
know
all
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
and
her
visions
do
not
interest
her
and
i
know
of
another
woman
also
not
a
peasant
woman
who
would
pass
in
sleep
into
countries
of
an
unearthly
beauty
and
who
never
cared
for
anything
but
to
be
busy
about
her
house
and
her
children
and
presently
an
herb
doctor
cured
her
as
he
called
it
wisdom
and
beauty
and
power
may
sometimes
as
i
think
come
to
those
who
die
every
day
they
live
though
their
dying
may
not
be
like
the
dying
shakespeare
spoke
of
there
is
a
war
between
the
living
and
the
dead
and
the
irish
stories
keep
harping
upon
it
they
will
have
it
that
when
the
potatoes
or
the
wheat
or
any
other
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
decay
they
ripen
in
faery
and
that
our
dreams
lose
their
wisdom
when
the
sap
rises
in
the
trees
and
that
our
dreams
can
make
the
trees
wither
and
that
one
hears
the
bleating
of
the
lambs
of
faery
in
november
and
that
blind
eyes
can
see
more
than
other
eyes
because
the
soul
always
believes
in
these
or
in
like
things
the
cell
and
the
wilderness
shall
never
be
long
empty
or
lovers
come
into
the
world
who
will
not
understand
the
verse
heardst
thou
not
sweet
words
among
that
minstrelsy
heardst
thou
not
that
those
who
die
awake
in
a
world
of
ecstasy
how
love
when
limbs
are
interwoven
and
sleep
when
the
night
of
life
is
cloven
and
thought
to
the
world
dim
boundaries
clinging
and
music
when
one
beloved
is
singing
is
death
the
friends
of
the
people
of
faery
those
that
see
the
people
of
faery
most
often
and
so
have
the
most
of
their
wisdom
are
often
very
poor
but
often
too
they
are
thought
to
have
a
strength
beyond
that
of
man
as
though
one
came
when
one
has
passed
the
threshold
of
trance
to
those
sweet
waters
where
maeldun
saw
the
dishevelled
eagles
bathe
and
become
young
again
there
was
an
old
martin
roland
who
lived
near
a
bog
a
little
out
of
gort
who
saw
them
often
from
his
young
days
and
always
towards
the
end
of
his
life
though
i
would
hardly
call
him
their
friend
he
told
me
a
few
months
before
his
death
that
they
would
not
let
him
sleep
at
night
with
crying
things
at
him
in
irish
and
with
playing
their
pipes
he
had
asked
a
friend
of
his
what
he
should
do
and
the
friend
had
told
him
to
buy
a
flute
and
play
on
it
when
they
began
to
shout
or
to
play
on
their
pipes
and
maybe
they
would
give
up
annoying
him
and
he
did
and
they
always
went
out
into
the
field
when
he
began
to
play
he
showed
me
the
pipe
and
blew
through
it
and
made
a
noise
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
play
and
then
he
showed
me
where
he
had
pulled
his
chimney
down
because
one
of
them
used
to
sit
up
on
it
and
play
on
the
pipes
a
friend
of
his
and
mine
went
to
see
him
a
little
time
ago
for
she
heard
that
three
of
them
had
told
him
he
was
to
die
he
said
they
had
gone
away
after
warning
him
and
that
the
children
children
they
had
taken
i
suppose
who
used
to
come
with
them
and
play
about
the
house
with
them
had
gone
to
some
other
place
because
they
found
the
house
too
cold
for
them
maybe
and
he
died
a
week
after
he
had
said
these
things
his
neighbours
were
not
certain
that
he
really
saw
anything
in
his
old
age
but
they
were
all
certain
that
he
saw
things
when
he
was
a
young
man
his
brother
said
old
he
is
and
it
all
in
his
brain
the
things
he
sees
if
he
was
a
young
man
we
might
believe
in
him
but
he
was
improvident
and
never
got
on
with
his
brothers
a
neighbour
said
the
poor
man
they
say
they
are
mostly
in
his
head
now
but
sure
he
was
a
fine
fresh
man
twenty
years
ago
the
night
he
saw
them
linked
in
two
lots
like
young
slips
of
girls
walking
together
it
was
the
night
they
took
away
fallon
little
girl
and
she
told
how
fallon
little
girl
had
met
a
woman
with
red
hair
that
was
as
bright
as
silver
who
took
her
away
another
neighbour
who
was
herself
clouted
over
the
ear
by
one
of
them
for
going
into
a
fort
where
they
were
said
i
believe
it
mostly
in
his
head
they
are
and
when
he
stood
in
the
door
last
night
i
said
wind
does
be
always
in
my
ears
and
the
sound
of
it
never
stops
to
make
him
think
it
was
the
same
with
him
but
he
says
hear
them
singing
and
making
music
all
the
time
and
one
of
them
is
after
bringing
out
a
little
flute
and
it
on
it
he
playing
to
them
and
this
i
know
that
when
he
pulled
down
the
chimney
where
he
said
the
piper
used
to
be
sitting
and
playing
he
lifted
up
stones
and
he
an
old
man
that
i
could
not
have
lifted
when
i
was
young
and
strong
a
friend
has
sent
me
from
ulster
an
account
of
one
who
was
on
terms
of
true
friendship
with
the
people
of
faery
it
has
been
taken
down
accurately
for
my
friend
who
had
heard
the
old
woman
story
some
time
before
i
heard
of
it
got
her
to
tell
it
over
again
and
wrote
it
out
at
once
she
began
by
telling
the
old
woman
that
she
did
not
like
being
in
the
house
alone
because
of
the
ghosts
and
fairies
and
the
old
woman
said
there
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
in
faeries
miss
many
the
time
i
talked
to
a
woman
myself
that
was
a
faery
or
something
of
the
sort
and
no
less
and
more
than
mortal
anyhow
she
used
to
come
about
your
grandfather
house
your
mother
grandfather
that
is
in
my
young
days
but
you
have
heard
all
about
her
my
friend
said
that
she
had
heard
about
her
but
a
long
time
before
and
she
wanted
to
hear
about
her
again
and
the
old
woman
went
on
well
dear
the
very
first
time
ever
i
heard
word
of
her
coming
about
was
when
your
uncle
that
is
your
mother
uncle
joseph
married
and
building
a
house
for
his
wife
for
he
brought
her
first
to
his
father
up
at
the
house
by
the
lough
my
father
and
us
were
living
nigh
hand
to
where
the
new
house
was
to
be
built
to
overlook
the
men
at
their
work
my
father
was
a
weaver
and
brought
his
looms
and
all
there
into
a
cottage
that
was
close
by
the
foundations
were
marked
out
and
the
building
stones
lying
about
but
the
masons
had
not
come
yet
and
one
day
i
was
standing
with
my
mother
foment
the
house
when
we
sees
a
smart
wee
woman
coming
up
the
field
over
the
burn
to
us
i
was
a
bit
of
a
girl
at
the
time
playing
about
and
sporting
myself
but
i
mind
her
as
well
as
if
i
saw
her
there
now
my
friend
asked
how
the
woman
was
dressed
and
the
old
woman
said
it
was
a
gray
cloak
she
had
on
with
a
green
cashmere
skirt
and
a
black
silk
handkercher
tied
round
her
head
like
the
country
women
did
use
to
wear
in
them
times
my
friend
asked
how
wee
was
she
and
the
old
woman
said
well
now
she
was
wee
at
all
when
i
think
of
it
for
all
we
called
her
the
wee
woman
she
was
bigger
than
many
a
one
and
yet
not
tall
as
you
would
say
she
was
like
a
woman
about
thirty
and
round
in
the
face
she
was
like
miss
betty
your
grandmother
sister
and
betty
was
like
none
of
the
rest
not
like
your
grandmother
nor
any
of
them
she
was
round
and
fresh
in
the
face
and
she
never
was
married
and
she
never
would
take
any
man
and
we
used
to
say
that
the
wee
woman
her
being
like
betty
was
maybe
one
of
their
own
people
that
had
been
took
off
before
she
grew
to
her
full
height
and
for
that
she
was
always
following
us
and
warning
and
foretelling
this
time
she
walks
straight
over
to
where
my
mother
was
standing
over
to
the
lough
this
minute
ordering
her
like
that
over
to
the
lough
and
tell
joseph
that
he
must
change
the
foundation
of
this
house
to
where
show
you
fornent
the
thornbush
that
is
where
it
is
to
be
built
if
he
is
to
have
luck
and
prosperity
so
do
what
i
telling
ye
this
minute
the
house
was
being
built
on
path
i
suppose
the
path
used
by
the
people
of
faery
in
their
journeys
and
my
mother
brings
joseph
down
and
shows
him
and
he
changes
the
foundations
the
way
he
was
bid
but
did
bring
it
exactly
to
where
was
pointed
and
the
end
of
that
was
when
he
come
to
the
house
his
own
wife
lost
her
life
with
an
accident
that
come
to
a
horse
that
had
room
to
turn
right
with
a
harrow
between
the
bush
and
the
wall
the
wee
woman
was
queer
and
angry
when
next
she
come
and
says
to
us
did
do
as
i
bid
him
but
see
what
he
see
my
friend
asked
where
the
woman
came
from
this
time
and
if
she
was
dressed
as
before
and
the
woman
said
always
the
same
way
up
the
field
beyant
the
burn
it
was
a
thin
sort
of
shawl
she
had
about
her
in
summer
and
a
cloak
about
her
in
winter
and
many
and
many
a
time
she
came
and
always
it
was
good
advice
she
was
giving
to
my
mother
and
warning
her
what
not
to
do
if
she
would
have
good
luck
there
was
none
of
the
other
children
of
us
ever
seen
her
unless
me
but
i
used
to
be
glad
when
i
seen
her
coming
up
the
bum
and
would
run
out
and
catch
her
by
the
hand
and
the
cloak
and
call
to
my
mother
the
wee
woman
no
man
body
ever
seen
her
my
father
used
to
be
wanting
to
and
was
angry
with
my
mother
and
me
thinking
we
were
telling
lies
and
talking
foolish
like
and
so
one
day
when
she
had
come
and
was
sitting
by
the
fireside
talking
to
my
mother
i
slips
out
to
the
field
where
he
was
digging
up
says
i
ye
want
to
see
her
sitting
at
the
fireside
now
talking
to
mother
so
in
he
comes
with
me
and
looks
round
angry
like
and
sees
nothing
and
he
up
with
a
broom
that
was
near
hand
and
hits
me
a
crig
with
it
that
now
says
he
making
a
fool
of
me
and
away
with
him
as
fast
as
he
could
and
queer
and
angry
with
me
the
wee
woman
says
to
me
then
got
that
now
for
bringing
people
to
see
me
no
man
body
ever
seen
me
and
none
ever
will
there
was
one
day
though
she
gave
him
a
queer
fright
anyway
whether
he
had
seen
her
or
not
he
was
in
among
the
cattle
when
it
happened
and
he
comes
up
to
the
house
all
trembling
like
let
me
hear
you
say
another
word
of
your
wee
woman

have
got
enough
of
her
this
time

time

the
same

was
up
gortin
to
sell

in
steps

a
sort
of
a
weed

thinks
to
herself

on
the
floor
and
lo
and

fright
as
ever
he
got
in
his
life
what
it
was
i
do
right

but
anyway
he
was
badly
damaged
by
it
my
mother
was
in
a
queer
way
frightened
of
the
wee
woman
after
what
she
done
and
sure
enough
the
next
time
she
was
angry
believe
me
she
said
ye
threw
the
herb
i
gave
ye
in
the
fire
and
i
went
far
enough
for
it
there

dead
in
america

time
for

and
with
that
she
gave
a
swirl
round
on
her
feet
and
raises
up
in
the
air
and
round
and
round
she
goes
and
up
and
up
as
if
it
was
a
winding
stairs
she
went
up
only
far
swifter
she
went
up
and
up
till
she
was
no
bigger
than
a
bird
up
against
the
clouds
singing
and
singing
the
whole
time
the
loveliest
music
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
from
that
day
to
this
it
was
a
hymn
she
was
singing
but
poetry

poetry
and
me
and
my
mother
stands
gaping
up
and
all
of
a
tremble
is
she
at
all

angel

is
or
a
faery
woman
or

letty
that
was
your
grandmother
dear
but
miss
letty
she
was
then
and
no
word
of
her
being

and
she
wondered
to
see
us
gaping
up
that
way
till
me
and
my
mother
told
her
of
it
she
went
on
then
and
was
lovely
looking
she
was
up
the
lane
where
none
of
us
could
see
her
coming
forward
when
the
wee
woman
rose
up
in
that
queer
way
saying
comes
miss
letty
in
all
her
finery
who
knows
to
what
far
country
she
went
or
to
see
whom
dying
it
was
never
after
dark
she
came
but
daylight
always
as
far
as
i
mind
but
wanst
and
that
was
on
a
hallow
eve
night
my
mother
was
by
the
fire
making
ready
the
supper
she
had
a
duck
down
and
some
apples
in
slips
the
wee
woman
come
to
pass
my
hallow
eve
with
you
says
she
right
says
my
mother
and
thinks
to
herself

give
her
her
supper
nicely
down
she
sits
by
the
fire
a
while
tell
you
where
you
bring

she
the
room
beyond
there
beside
the
loom
set
a
chair
in
and
a
plate
spending
the
night
may
ye
as
well
sit
by
the
table
and
eat
with
the
rest
of
us
what
you
bid
and
set
whatever
you
give
me
in
the
room
beyant
i
eat
there
and
nowhere
else
so
my
mother
sets
her
a
plate
of
duck
and
some
apples
whatever
was
going
in
where
she
bid
and
we
got
to
our
supper
and
she
to
hers
and
when
we
rose
i
went
in
and
there
lo
and
behold
ye
was
her
a
bit
ate
of
each
portion
and
she
clean
gone
dreams
that
have
no
moral
the
friend
who
heard
about
maive
and
the
went
to
the
workhouse
another
day
she
found
the
old
people
cold
and
wretched
like
flies
in
winter
she
said
but
they
forgot
the
cold
when
they
began
to
talk
a
man
had
just
left
them
who
had
played
cards
in
a
rath
with
the
people
of
faery
who
had
played
very
fair
and
one
old
man
had
seen
an
enchanted
black
pig
one
night
and
there
were
two
old
people
my
friend
had
heard
quarrelling
as
to
whether
raftery
or
callanan
was
the
better
poet
one
had
said
of
raftery
he
was
a
big
man
and
his
songs
have
gone
through
the
whole
world
i
remember
him
well
he
had
a
voice
like
the
wind
but
the
other
was
certain
that
you
would
stand
in
the
snow
to
listen
to
callanan
presently
an
old
man
began
to
tell
my
friend
a
story
and
all
listened
delightedly
bursting
into
laughter
now
and
then
the
story
which
i
am
going
to
tell
just
as
it
was
told
was
one
of
those
old
rambling
moralless
tales
which
are
the
delight
of
the
poor
and
the
hard
driven
wherever
life
is
left
in
its
natural
simplicity
they
tell
of
a
time
when
nothing
had
consequences
when
even
if
you
were
killed
if
only
you
had
a
good
heart
somebody
would
bring
you
to
life
again
with
a
touch
of
a
rod
and
when
if
you
were
a
prince
and
happened
to
look
exactly
like
your
brother
you
might
go
to
bed
with
his
queen
and
have
only
a
little
quarrel
afterwards
we
too
if
we
were
so
weak
and
poor
that
everything
threatened
us
with
misfortune
would
remember
if
foolish
people
left
us
alone
every
old
dream
that
has
been
strong
enough
to
fling
the
weight
of
the
world
from
its
shoulders
there
was
a
king
one
time
who
was
very
much
put
out
because
he
had
no
son
and
he
went
at
last
to
consult
his
chief
adviser
and
the
chief
adviser
said
it
easy
enough
managed
if
you
do
as
i
tell
you
let
you
send
some
one
says
he
to
such
a
place
to
catch
a
fish
and
when
the
fish
is
brought
in
give
it
to
the
queen
your
wife
to
eat
so
the
king
sent
as
he
was
told
and
the
fish
was
caught
and
brought
in
and
he
gave
it
to
the
cook
and
bade
her
put
it
before
the
fire
but
to
be
careful
with
it
and
not
to
let
any
blob
or
blister
rise
on
it
but
it
is
impossible
to
cook
a
fish
before
the
fire
without
the
skin
of
it
rising
in
some
place
or
other
and
so
there
came
a
blob
on
the
skin
and
the
cook
put
her
finger
on
it
to
smooth
it
down
and
then
she
put
her
finger
into
her
mouth
to
cool
it
and
so
she
got
a
taste
of
the
fish
and
then
it
was
sent
up
to
the
queen
and
she
ate
it
and
what
was
left
of
it
was
thrown
out
into
the
yard
and
there
was
a
mare
in
the
yard
and
a
greyhound
and
they
ate
the
bits
that
were
thrown
out
and
before
a
year
was
out
the
queen
had
a
young
son
and
the
cook
had
a
young
son
and
the
mare
had
two
foals
and
the
greyhound
had
two
pups
and
the
two
young
sons
were
sent
out
for
a
while
to
some
place
to
be
cared
and
when
they
came
back
they
adviser
and
said
tell
me
some
way
that
i
can
know
were
so
much
like
one
another
no
person
could
know
which
was
the
queen
son
and
which
was
the
cook
and
the
queen
was
vexed
at
that
and
she
went
to
the
chief
which
is
my
own
son
for
i
do
like
to
be
giving
the
same
eating
and
drinking
to
the
cook
son
as
to
my
own
it
is
easy
to
know
that
said
the
chief
adviser
if
you
will
do
as
i
tell
you
go
you
outside
and
stand
at
the
door
they
will
be
coming
in
by
and
when
they
see
you
your
own
son
will
bow
his
head
but
the
cook
son
will
only
laugh
so
she
did
that
and
when
her
own
son
bowed
his
head
her
servants
put
a
mark
on
him
that
she
would
know
him
again
and
when
they
were
all
sitting
at
their
dinner
after
that
she
said
to
jack
that
was
the
cook
son
it
is
time
for
you
to
go
away
out
of
this
for
you
are
not
my
son
and
her
own
son
that
we
will
call
bill
said
do
not
send
him
away
are
we
not
brothers
but
jack
said
i
would
have
been
long
ago
out
of
this
house
if
i
knew
it
was
not
my
own
father
and
mother
owned
it
and
for
all
bill
could
say
to
him
he
would
not
stop
but
before
he
went
they
were
by
the
well
that
was
in
the
garden
and
he
said
to
bill
if
harm
ever
happens
to
me
that
water
on
the
top
of
the
well
will
be
blood
and
the
water
below
will
be
honey
then
he
took
one
of
the
pups
and
one
of
the
two
horses
that
was
foaled
after
the
mare
eating
the
fish
and
the
wind
that
was
after
him
could
not
catch
him
and
he
caught
the
wind
that
was
before
him
and
he
went
on
till
he
came
to
a
weaver
house
and
he
asked
him
for
a
lodging
and
he
gave
it
to
him
and
then
he
went
on
till
he
came
to
a
king
house
and
he
sent
in
at
the
door
to
ask
did
he
want
a
servant
all
i
want
said
the
king
is
a
boy
that
will
drive
out
the
cows
to
the
field
every
morning
and
bring
them
in
at
night
to
be
milked
i
will
do
that
for
you
said
jack
so
the
king
engaged
him
in
the
morning
jack
was
sent
out
with
the
cows
and
the
place
he
was
told
to
drive
them
to
had
not
a
blade
of
grass
in
it
for
them
but
was
full
of
stones
so
jack
looked
about
for
some
place
where
there
would
be
better
grass
and
after
a
while
he
saw
a
field
with
good
green
grass
in
it
and
it
belonging
to
a
giant
so
he
knocked
down
a
bit
of
the
wall
and
drove
them
in
and
he
went
up
himself
into
an
and
began
to
eat
the
apples
then
the
giant
came
into
the
field
says
he
i
smell
the
blood
of
an
irishman
i
see
you
where
you
are
up
in
the
tree
he
said
you
are
too
big
for
one
mouthful
and
too
small
for
two
mouthfuls
and
i
do
know
what
do
with
you
if
i
do
grind
you
up
and
make
snuff
for
my
nose
as
you
are
strong
be
merciful
says
jack
up
in
the
tree
come
down
out
of
that
you
little
dwarf
said
the
giant
or
i
tear
you
and
the
tree
asunder
so
jack
came
down
would
you
sooner
be
driving
knives
into
one
another
hearts
said
the
giant
or
would
you
sooner
be
fighting
one
another
on
flags
fighting
on
flags
is
what
i
used
to
at
home
said
jack
and
your
dirty
feet
will
be
sinking
in
them
and
my
feet
will
be
rising
so
then
they
began
the
fight
the
ground
that
was
hard
they
made
soft
and
the
ground
that
was
soft
they
made
hard
and
they
made
spring
wells
come
up
through
the
green
flags
they
were
like
that
all
through
the
day
no
one
getting
the
upper
hand
of
the
other
and
at
last
a
little
bird
came
and
sat
on
the
bush
and
said
to
jack
if
you
do
make
an
end
of
him
by
sunset
he
make
an
end
of
you
then
jack
put
out
his
strength
and
he
brought
the
giant
down
on
his
knees
give
me
my
life
says
the
giant
and
i
give
you
the
three
best
gifts
what
are
those
said
jack
a
sword
that
nothing
can
stand
against
and
a
suit
that
when
you
put
it
on
you
will
see
everybody
and
nobody
will
see
you
and
a
pair
of
shoes
that
will
make
you
ran
faster
than
the
wind
blows
where
are
they
to
be
found
said
jack
in
that
red
door
you
see
there
in
the
hill
so
jack
went
and
got
them
out
where
will
i
try
the
sword
says
he
try
it
on
that
ugly
black
stump
of
a
tree
says
the
giant
i
see
nothing
blacker
or
uglier
than
your
own
head
says
jack
and
with
that
he
made
one
stroke
and
cut
off
the
giant
head
that
it
went
into
the
air
and
he
caught
it
on
the
sword
as
it
was
coming
down
and
made
two
halves
of
it
it
is
well
for
you
i
did
not
join
the
body
again
said
the
head
or
you
would
have
never
been
able
to
strike
it
off
again
i
did
not
give
you
the
chance
of
that
said
jack
and
he
brought
away
the
great
suit
with
him
so
he
brought
the
cows
home
at
evening
and
every
one
wondered
at
all
the
milk
they
gave
that
night
and
when
the
king
was
sitting
at
dinner
with
the
princess
his
daughter
and
the
rest
he
said
i
think
i
only
hear
two
roars
from
beyond
in
place
of
three
the
next
morning
jack
went
out
again
with
the
cows
and
he
saw
another
field
full
of
grass
and
he
knocked
down
the
wall
and
let
the
cows
in
all
happened
the
same
as
the
day
before
but
the
giant
that
came
this
time
had
two
heads
and
they
fought
together
and
the
little
bird
came
and
spoke
to
jack
as
before
and
when
jack
had
brought
the
giant
down
he
said
give
me
my
life
and
i
give
you
the
best
thing
i
have
what
is
that
says
jack
it
a
suit
that
you
can
put
on
and
you
will
see
every
one
but
no
one
can
see
you
where
is
it
said
jack
it
inside
that
little
red
door
at
the
side
of
the
hill
so
jack
went
and
brought
out
the
suit
and
then
he
cut
off
the
giant
two
heads
and
caught
them
coming
down
and
made
four
halves
of
them
and
they
said
it
was
well
for
him
he
had
not
given
them
time
to
join
the
body
that
night
when
the
cows
came
home
they
gave
so
much
milk
that
all
the
vessels
that
could
be
found
were
filled
up
the
next
morning
jack
went
out
again
and
all
happened
as
before
and
the
giant
this
time
had
four
heads
and
jack
made
eight
halves
of
them
and
the
giant
had
told
him
to
go
to
a
little
blue
door
in
the
side
of
the
hill
and
there
he
got
a
pair
of
shoes
that
when
you
put
them
on
would
go
faster
than
the
wind
that
night
the
cows
gave
so
much
milk
that
there
were
not
vessels
enough
to
hold
it
and
it
was
given
to
tenants
and
to
poor
people
passing
the
road
and
the
rest
was
thrown
out
at
the
windows
i
was
passing
that
way
myself
and
i
got
a
drink
of
it
that
night
the
king
said
to
jack
why
is
it
the
cows
are
giving
so
much
milk
these
days
are
you
bringing
them
to
any
other
grass
i
am
not
said
jack
but
i
have
a
good
stick
and
whenever
they
would
stop
still
or
lie
down
i
give
them
blows
of
it
that
they
jump
and
leap
over
walls
and
stones
and
ditches
that
the
way
to
make
cows
give
plenty
of
milk
and
that
night
at
the
dinner
the
king
said
i
hear
no
roars
at
all
the
next
morning
the
king
and
the
princess
were
watching
at
the
window
to
see
what
would
jack
do
when
he
got
to
the
field
and
jack
knew
they
were
there
and
he
got
a
stick
and
began
to
batter
the
cows
that
they
went
leaping
and
jumping
over
stones
and
walls
and
ditches
there
is
no
lie
in
what
jack
said
said
the
king
then
now
there
was
a
great
serpent
at
that
time
used
to
come
every
seven
years
and
he
had
to
get
a
kines
daughter
to
eat
unless
she
would
have
some
good
man
to
fight
for
her
and
it
was
the
princess
at
the
place
jack
was
had
to
be
given
to
it
that
time
and
the
king
had
been
feeding
a
bully
underground
for
seven
years
and
you
may
believe
he
got
the
best
of
everything
to
be
ready
to
fight
it
and
when
the
time
came
the
princess
went
out
and
the
bully
with
her
down
to
the
shore
and
when
they
got
there
what
did
he
do
but
to
tie
the
princess
to
a
tree
the
way
the
serpent
would
be
able
to
swallow
her
easy
with
no
delay
and
he
himself
went
and
hid
up
in
an
and
jack
knew
what
was
going
on
for
the
princess
had
told
him
about
it
and
had
asked
would
he
help
her
but
he
said
he
would
not
but
he
came
out
now
and
he
put
on
the
suit
he
had
taken
from
the
first
giant
and
he
came
by
the
place
the
princess
was
but
she
did
know
him
is
that
right
for
a
princess
to
be
tied
to
a
tree
said
jack
it
is
not
indeed
said
she
and
she
told
him
what
had
happened
and
how
the
serpent
was
coming
to
take
her
if
you
will
let
me
sleep
for
awhile
with
my
head
in
your
lap
said
jack
you
could
wake
me
when
it
is
coming
so
he
did
that
and
she
awakened
him
when
she
saw
the
serpent
coming
and
jack
got
up
and
fought
with
it
and
drove
it
back
into
the
sea
and
then
he
cut
the
rope
that
fastened
her
and
he
went
away
the
bully
came
down
then
out
of
the
tree
and
he
brought
the
princess
to
where
the
king
was
and
he
said
i
got
a
friend
of
mine
to
come
and
fight
the
serpent
where
i
was
a
little
timorous
after
being
so
long
shut
up
underground
but
i
do
the
fighting
myself
the
next
day
they
went
out
again
and
the
same
thing
happened
the
bully
tied
up
the
princess
where
the
serpent
could
come
at
her
fair
and
easy
and
went
up
himself
to
hide
in
the
then
jack
put
on
the
suit
he
had
taken
from
the
second
giant
and
he
walked
out
and
the
princess
did
not
know
him
but
she
told
him
all
that
had
happened
yesterday
and
how
some
young
gentleman
she
did
not
know
had
come
and
saved
her
so
jack
asked
might
he
lie
down
and
take
a
sleep
with
his
head
in
her
lap
the
way
she
could
awake
him
and
an
happened
the
same
way
as
the
day
before
and
the
bully
gave
her
up
to
the
king
and
said
he
had
brought
another
of
his
friends
to
fight
for
her
that
day
the
next
day
she
was
brought
down
to
the
shore
as
before
and
a
great
many
people
gathered
to
see
the
serpent
that
was
coming
to
bring
the
king
daughter
away
and
jack
brought
out
the
suit
of
clothes
he
had
brought
away
from
the
third
giant
and
she
did
not
know
him
and
they
talked
as
before
but
when
he
was
asleep
this
time
she
thought
she
would
make
sure
of
being
able
to
find
him
again
and
she
took
out
her
scissors
and
cut
off
a
piece
of
his
hair
and
made
a
little
packet
of
it
and
put
it
away
and
she
did
another
thing
she
took
off
one
of
the
shoes
that
was
on
his
feet
and
when
she
saw
the
serpent
coming
she
woke
him
and
he
said
this
time
i
will
put
the
serpent
in
a
way
that
he
will
eat
no
more
daughters
so
he
took
out
the
sword
he
had
got
from
the
giant
and
he
put
it
in
at
the
back
of
the
serpent
neck
the
way
blood
and
water
came
spouting
out
that
went
for
fifty
miles
inland
and
made
an
end
of
him
and
then
he
made
off
and
no
one
saw
what
way
he
went
and
the
bully
brought
the
princess
to
the
king
and
claimed
to
have
saved
her
and
it
is
he
who
was
made
much
of
and
was
the
man
after
that
but
when
the
feast
was
made
ready
for
the
wedding
the
princess
took
out
the
bit
of
hair
she
had
and
she
said
she
would
marry
no
one
but
the
man
whose
hair
would
match
that
and
she
showed
the
shoe
and
said
that
she
would
marry
no
one
whose
foot
would
not
fit
that
shoe
as
well
and
the
bully
tried
to
put
on
the
shoe
but
so
much
as
his
toe
would
not
go
into
it
and
as
to
his
hair
it
did
match
at
all
to
the
bit
of
hair
she
had
cut
from
the
man
that
saved
her
so
then
the
king
gave
a
great
ball
to
bring
all
the
chief
men
of
the
country
together
to
try
would
the
shoe
fit
any
of
them
and
they
were
all
going
to
carpenters
and
joiners
getting
bits
of
their
feet
cut
off
to
try
could
they
wear
the
shoe
but
it
was
no
use
not
one
of
them
could
get
it
on
then
the
king
went
to
his
chief
adviser
and
asked
what
could
he
do
and
the
chief
adviser
bade
him
to
give
another
ball
and
this
time
he
said
give
it
to
poor
as
well
as
rich
so
the
ball
was
given
and
many
came
flocking
to
it
but
the
shoe
would
not
fit
any
one
of
them
and
the
chief
adviser
said
is
every
one
here
that
belongs
to
the
house
they
are
all
here
said
the
king
except
the
boy
that
minds
the
cows
and
i
would
not
like
him
to
be
coming
up
here
jack
was
below
in
the
yard
at
the
time
and
he
heard
what
the
king
said
and
he
was
very
angry
and
he
went
and
got
his
sword
and
came
running
up
the
stairs
to
strike
off
the
king
head
but
the
man
that
kept
the
gate
met
him
on
the
stairs
before
he
could
get
to
the
king
and
quieted
him
down
and
when
he
got
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
the
princess
saw
him
she
gave
a
cry
and
ran
into
his
arms
and
they
tried
the
shoe
and
it
fitted
him
and
his
hair
matched
to
the
piece
that
had
been
cut
off
so
then
they
were
married
and
a
great
feast
was
given
for
three
days
and
three
nights
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
one
morning
there
came
a
deer
outside
the
window
with
bells
on
it
and
they
ringing
and
it
called
out
here
is
the
hunt
where
is
the
huntsman
and
the
hound
so
when
jack
heard
that
he
got
up
and
took
his
horse
and
his
hound
and
went
hunting
the
deer
when
it
was
in
the
hollow
he
was
on
the
hill
and
when
it
was
on
the
hill
he
was
in
the
hollow
and
that
went
on
all
through
the
day
and
when
night
fell
it
went
into
a
wood
and
jack
went
into
the
wood
after
it
and
all
he
could
see
was
a
cabin
and
he
went
in
and
there
he
saw
an
old
woman
about
two
hundred
years
old
and
she
sitting
over
the
fire
did
you
see
a
deer
pass
this
way
says
jack
i
did
not
says
she
but
it
too
late
now
for
you
to
be
following
a
deer
let
you
stop
the
night
here
what
will
i
do
with
my
horse
and
my
hound
said
jack
here
are
two
ribs
of
hair
says
she
and
let
you
tie
them
up
with
them
so
jack
went
out
and
tied
up
the
horse
and
the
hound
and
when
he
came
in
again
the
old
woman
said
you
killed
my
three
sons
and
i
going
to
kill
you
now
and
she
put
on
a
pair
of
each
one
of
them
nine
stone
weight
and
the
nails
in
them
fifteen
inches
long
then
they
began
to
fight
and
jack
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
help
hound
he
cried
out
then
squeeze

out
the
old
woman
and
the
rib
of
hair
that
was
about
the
hound
neck
squeezed
him
to
death
help

jack
called
out
then
squeeze

out
the
old
woman
and
the
rib
of
hair
that
was
about
the
horse
neck
began
to
tighten
and
squeeze
him
to
death
then
the
old
woman
made
an
end
of
jack
and
threw
him
outside
the
door
to
go
back
now
to
bill
he
was
out
in
the
garden
one
day
and
he
took
a
look
at
the
well
and
what
did
he
see
but
the
water
at
the
top
was
blood
and
what
was
underneath
was
honey
so
he
went
into
the
house
again
and
he
said
to
his
mother
i
will
never
eat
a
second
meal
at
the
same
table
or
sleep
a
second
night
in
the
same
bed
till
i
know
what
is
happening
to
jack
so
he
took
the
other
horse
and
hound
then
and
set
off
over
the
hills
where
cock
never
crows
and
horn
never
sounds
and
the
devil
never
blows
his
bugle
and
at
last
he
came
to
the
weaver
house
and
when
he
went
in
the
weaver
says
you
are
welcome
and
i
can
give
you
better
treatment
than
i
did
the
last
time
you
came
in
to
me
for
she
thought
it
was
jack
who
was
there
they
were
so
much
like
one
another
that
is
good
said
bill
to
himself
my
brother
has
been
here
and
he
gave
the
weaver
the
full
of
a
basin
of
gold
in
the
morning
before
he
left
then
he
went
on
till
he
came
to
the
king
house
and
when
he
was
at
the
door
the
princess
came
running
down
the
stairs
and
said
welcome
to
you
back
again
and
all
the
people
said
it
is
a
wonder
you
have
gone
hunting
three
days
after
your
marriage
and
to
stop
so
long
away
so
he
stopped
that
night
with
the
princess
and
she
thought
it
was
her
own
husband
all
the
time
and
in
the
morning
the
deer
came
and
bells
ringing
on
her
under
the
windows
and
called
out
the
hunt
is
here
where
are
the
huntsmen
and
the
hounds
then
bill
got
up
and
got
his
horse
and
his
hound
and
followed
her
over
hills
and
hollows
till
they
came
to
the
wood
and
there
he
saw
nothing
but
the
cabin
and
the
old
woman
sitting
by
the
fire
and
she
bade
him
stop
the
night
there
and
gave
him
two
ribs
of
hair
to
tie
his
horse
and
his
hound
with
but
bill
was
wittier
than
jack
was
and
before
he
went
out
he
threw
the
ribs
of
hair
into
the
fire
secretly
when
he
came
in
the
old
woman
said
your
brother
killed
my
three
sons
and
i
killed
him
and
i
kill
you
along
with
him
and
she
put
her
gloves
on
and
they
began
the
fight
and
then
bill
called
out
help
horse
squeeze
hair
called
the
old
woman
i
ca
squeeze
i
in
the
fire
said
the
hair
and
the
horse
came
in
and
gave
her
a
blow
of
his
hoof
help
hound
said
bill
then
squeeze
hair
said
the
old
woman
i
ca
i
in
the
fire
said
the
second
hair
then
the
bound
put
his
teeth
in
her
and
bill
brought
her
down
and
she
cried
for
mercy
give
me
my
life
she
said
and
i
tell
you
where
you
get
your
brother
again
and
his
hound
and
horse
where
that
said
bill
do
you
see
that
rod
over
the
fire
said
she
take
it
down
and
go
outside
the
door
where
you
see
three
green
stones
and
strike
them
with
the
rod
for
they
are
your
brother
and
his
horse
and
hound
and
they
come
to
life
again
i
will
but
i
make
a
green
stone
of
you
first
said
bill
and
he
cut
off
her
head
with
his
sword
then
he
went
out
and
struck
the
stones
and
sure
enough
there
were
jack
and
his
horse
and
hound
alive
and
well
and
they
began
striking
other
stones
around
and
men
came
from
them
that
had
been
turned
to
stones
hundreds
and
thousands
of
them
then
they
set
out
for
home
but
on
the
way
they
had
some
dispute
or
some
argument
together
for
jack
was
not
well
pleased
to
hear
he
had
spent
the
night
with
his
wife
and
bill
got
angry
and
he
struck
jack
with
the
rod
and
turned
him
to
a
green
stone
and
he
went
home
but
the
princess
saw
he
had
something
on
his
mind
and
he
said
then
i
have
killed
my
brother
and
he
went
back
then
and
brought
him
to
life
and
they
lived
happy
ever
after
and
they
had
children
by
the
basketful
and
threw
them
out
by
the
shovelful
i
was
passing
one
time
myself
and
they
called
me
in
and
gave
me
a
cup
of
tea
by
the
roadside
last
night
i
went
to
a
wide
place
on
the
kiltartan
road
to
listen
to
some
irish
songs
while
i
waited
for
the
singers
an
old
man
sang
about
that
country
beauty
who
died
so
many
years
ago
and
spoke
of
a
singer
he
had
known
who
sang
so
beautifully
that
no
horse
would
pass
him
but
must
turn
its
head
and
cock
its
ears
to
listen
presently
a
score
of
men
and
boys
and
girls
with
shawls
over
their
beads
gathered
under
the
trees
to
listen
somebody
sang
sa
muirnin
diles
and
then
somebody
else
jimmy
mo
milestor
mournful
songs
of
separation
of
death
and
of
exile
then
some
of
the
men
stood
up
and
began
to
dance
while
another
lilted
the
measure
they
danced
to
and
then
somebody
sang
eiblin
a
ruin
that
glad
song
of
meeting
which
has
always
moved
me
more
than
other
songs
because
the
lover
who
made
it
sang
it
to
his
sweetheart
under
the
shadow
of
a
mountain
i
looked
at
every
day
through
my
childhood
the
voices
melted
into
the
twilight
and
were
mixed
into
the
trees
and
when
i
thought
of
the
words
they
too
melted
away
and
were
mixed
with
the
generations
of
men
now
it
was
a
phrase
now
it
was
an
attitude
of
mind
an
emotional
form
that
had
carried
my
memory
to
older
verses
or
even
to
forgotten
mythologies
i
was
carried
so
far
that
it
was
as
though
i
came
to
one
of
the
four
rivers
and
followed
it
under
the
wall
of
paradise
to
the
roots
of
the
trees
of
knowledge
and
of
life
there
is
no
song
or
story
handed
down
among
the
cottages
that
has
not
words
and
thoughts
to
carry
one
as
far
for
though
one
can
know
but
a
little
of
their
ascent
one
knows
that
they
ascend
like
medieval
genealogies
through
unbroken
dignities
to
the
beginning
of
the
world
folk
art
is
indeed
the
oldest
of
the
aristocracies
of
thought
and
because
it
refuses
what
is
passing
and
trivial
the
merely
clever
and
pretty
as
certainly
as
the
vulgar
and
insincere
and
because
it
has
gathered
into
itself
the
simplest
and
most
unforgetable
thoughts
of
the
generations
it
is
the
soil
where
all
great
art
is
rooted
wherever
it
is
spoken
by
the
fireside
or
sung
by
the
roadside
or
carved
upon
the
lintel
appreciation
of
the
arts
that
a
single
mind
gives
unity
and
design
to
spreads
quickly
when
its
hour
is
come
in
a
society
that
has
cast
out
imaginative
tradition
only
a
few
people
three
or
four
thousand
out
of
millions
favoured
by
their
own
characters
and
by
happy
circumstance
and
only
then
after
much
labour
have
understanding
of
imaginative
things
and
yet
the
imagination
is
the
man
himself
the
churches
in
the
middle
age
won
all
the
arts
into
their
service
because
men
understood
that
when
imagination
is
impoverished
a
principal
voice
some
would
say
the
only
voice
for
the
awakening
of
wise
hope
and
durable
faith
and
understanding
charity
can
speak
but
in
broken
words
if
it
does
not
fall
silent
and
so
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
we
who
would
imaginative
tradition
by
making
old
songs
live
again
or
by
gathering
old
stories
into
books
take
part
in
the
quarrel
of
galilee
those
who
are
irish
and
would
spread
foreign
ways
which
for
all
but
a
few
are
ways
of
spiritual
poverty
take
part
also
their
part
is
with
those
who
were
of
jewry
and
yet
cried
out
if
thou
let
this
man
go
thou
art
not
caesar
friend
into
the
twilight
heart
in
a
time
come
clear
of
the
nets
of
wrong
and
right
laugh
heart
again
in
the
gray
twilight
sigh
heart
again
in
the
dew
of
the
morn
thy
mother
eire
is
always
young
dew
ever
shining
and
twilight
gray
though
hope
fall
from
thee
or
love
decay
burning
in
fires
of
a
slanderous
tongue
come
heart
where
hill
is
heaped
upon
hill
for
there
the
mystical
brotherhood
of
hollow
wood
and
the
hilly
wood
and
the
changing
moon
work
out
their
will
and
god
stands
winding
his
lonely
horn
and
time
and
world
are
ever
in
flight
and
love
is
less
kind
than
the
gray
twilight
and
hope
is
less
dear
than
the
dew
of
the
morn
