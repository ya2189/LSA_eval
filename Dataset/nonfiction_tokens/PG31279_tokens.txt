a
review
of
hoffman
race
traits
and
tendencies
of
the
american
negro
in
august
there
was
published
under
the
auspices
of
the
american
economic
association
a
work
entitled
race
traits
and
tendencies
of
the
american
negro
by
frederick
hoffman
statistician
to
the
prudential
insurance
company
of
america
this
work
presents
by
far
the
most
thorough
and
comprehensive
treatment
of
the
negro
problem
from
a
statistical
standpoint
which
has
yet
appeared
in
fact
it
may
be
regarded
as
the
most
important
utterance
on
the
subject
since
the
publication
of
uncle
tom
cabin
for
the
interest
which
the
famous
novel
aroused
in
the
domain
of
sentiment
and
generous
feelings
the
present
work
seems
destined
to
awaken
in
the
field
of
science
and
exact
inquiry
hoffman
has
spent
ten
years
in
painful
and
laborious
investigation
of
the
subject
during
which
time
he
has
been
in
touch
with
the
fullest
sources
of
information
and
has
had
the
advice
and
assistance
of
the
highest
living
authorities
in
statistics
and
social
science
the
temper
of
mind
which
he
brought
to
this
study
may
be
judged
from
his
own
words
being
of
foreign
birth
a
german
i
was
fortunately
free
from
a
personal
bias
which
might
have
made
an
impartial
treatment
of
the
subject
difficult
there
are
other
assurances
that
the
author
possesses
no
personal
animosity
or
repugnance
against
the
negro
as
such
but
freedom
from
conscious
personal
bias
does
not
relieve
the
author
from
the
imputation
of
partiality
to
his
own
opinions
beyond
the
warrant
of
the
facts
which
he
has
presented
indeed
it
would
seem
that
his
conclusion
was
reached
from
considerations
and
that
facts
have
been
collected
in
order
to
justify
it
the
main
conclusion
of
the
work
is
that
the
negro
race
in
america
is
deteriorating
physically
and
morally
in
such
manner
as
to
point
to
ulterior
extinction
and
that
this
decline
is
due
to
race
traits
rather
than
to
conditions
and
circumstances
of
life
not
only
do
we
find
this
conclusion
expressly
set
forth
in
connection
with
every
chapter
but
it
is
also
easily
discernible
in
foot
notes
and
quotations
in
the
general
drift
of
cited
references
and
between
the
lines
in
order
to
give
the
clearest
possible
statement
of
the
author
position
his
own
words
will
be
used
the
conditions
of
life
therefore
would
seem
to
be
of
less
importance
than
race
and
heredity
it
is
not
the
of
but
in
race
traits
and
that
we
find
the
causes
of
the
excessive
mortality
for
the
root
of
the
evil
lies
in
the
fact
of
an
immense
amount
of
immorality
which
is
a
race
trait
a
combination
of
these
traits
and
tendencies
must
in
the
end
cause
the
extinction
of
the
race
it
is
not
in
the
conditions
of
life
but
in
race
and
heredity
that
we
find
the
explanation
the
mixture
of
the
african
with
the
white
race
has
been
shown
to
have
seriously
affected
the
longevity
of
the
former
and
left
as
a
heritage
to
future
generations
the
poison
of
scrofula
tuberculosis
and
most
of
all
of
syphilis
if
the
reader
will
keep
constantly
in
mind
the
key
suggested
by
these
quotations
he
will
peruse
the
book
itself
as
well
as

greater
ease

facility

for
some

the
colored
element
may
continue
to
make
decennial
gains
but
it
is
very
probable
that
the
next
thirty
years
will
be
the
last
to
show
total

and
then
the
decrease
will
be
slow
but
sure

i
have
taken
this
quotation
from
another
work
by
the
same
author
as
it
represents
more
clearly
than
any
other
condensed
statement
the
substance
of
the
present
chapter
this
proposition
is
a
most
important
one
and
therefore
its
establishment
needs
to
be
inquired
into
with
the
greatest
particularity
if
a
race
does
not
possess
the
requisite
physical
stamina
it
is
impossible
for
it
to
maintain
a
high
degree
of
moral
and
intellectual
culture
or
compete
with
its
more
vigorous
rivals
in
the
race
of
civilization
all
the
elements
of
society
are
conserved
in
its
physical
basis
the
social
population
since
the
author
relies
mainly
upon
the
eleventh
census
for
facts
to
establish
his
conclusion
and
since
the
accuracy
of
this
census
is
widely
controverted
we
may
fairly
call
upon
him
to
prove
his
document
before
it
can
be
admitted
in
evidence
the
following
quotation
from
senator
mills
reflects
the
opinion
of
many
eminent
students
of
public
problems
as
to
the
accuracy
of
this
enumeration
the
announcement
that
our
population
is
only
was
a
genuine
surprise
not
only
to
those
who
looked
for
the
dark
side
of
the
picture
but
also
to
those
whose
faith
in
the
administration
and
its
census
bureau
had
never
for
a
moment
wavered
the
census
of
gave
the
present
returns
give
an
increase
of
which
is
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
that
this
number
is
not
even
approximately
correct
may
be
seen
by
comparing
the
increase
in
this
decade
with
the
gain
in
others
which
have
preceded
it
any
alleged
fact
that
is
without
the
pale
of
probability
stands
impeached
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
inquiry
and
must
be
verified
by
competent
evidence
basing
his
estimates
upon
the
school
census
the
senator
continues
the
state
of
texas
is
deprived
by
the
incorrect
returns
of
at
least
three
representatives
in
congress

loses

and
north

and
louisiana

whatever
force
there
may
be
in
the
protest
of
the
eloquent
texas
senator
applies
with
special
emphasis
to
the
colored
element
for
it
goes
without
saying
that
errors
in
enumeration
in
the
south
would
be
confined
mainly
to
the
negro
race
and
since
the
bulk
of
the
race
is
confined
to
this
section
such
errors
would
have
a
most
disastrous
effect
upon
its
rate
of
increase
as
shown
by
the
census
reports
the
following
table
exhibits
the
development
of
the
colored
population
for
the
last
one
hundred
years
as
well
as
its
decennial
rates
of
increase
and

of
the
total
population
population
of
the
united

colored

in
of

population
if
we
begin
with
the
first
census
year
after
the
constitutional
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
we
see
from
this
table
that
the
growth
of
the
negro
element
followed
the
ordinary
law
of
population
viz
a
gradual
decline
in
the
rate
of
increase
in
years
the
decennial
rate
of
increase
declined
from
about
per
cent
to
per
cent
but
from
to
there
was
a
decrease
from
to
per
cent
that
is
the
decline
in
ten
years
was
equal
to
that
of
the
previous
seventy
and
all
this
has
happened
during
an
era
of
profound
peace
and
prosperity
when
the
negro
population
was
subject
to
no
great
perturbing
influences
when
a
number
of
observations
follow
with
reasonable
uniformity
a
fixed
law
but
a
single
result
deviates
widely
from
this
law
it
is
usual
to
suspect
the
accuracy
of
the
discrepant
observation
the
author
nowhere
assigns
any
adequate
cause
for
this
sudden
slump
in
the
increase
of
the
colored
population
instead
of
attributing
it
in
part
at
least
to
the
probable
imperfection
of
the
eleventh
census
he
relies
wholly
upon
a
blind
force
recently
discovered
and
named
by
him
race
traits
and
tendencies
the
capriciousness
of
this
new
factor
in
that
it
may
suspend
operation
indefinitely
or
break
loose
in
a
day
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
the
author
at
least
it
does
not
seem
to
affect
the
confident
assurance
with
which
he
relies
upon
it
as
has
been
shrewdly
remarked
by
an
able
reviewer
it
would
seem
incumbent
on
him
hoffman
further
to
prove
that
these
race
traits
after
being
held
in
abeyance
for
at
least
a
century
first
took
decisive
action
in
the
decade
to
in
there
were
negroes
in
the
united
states
in
years
this
number
had
swollen
to
at
least
and
that
too
without
reinforcement
from
outside
immigration
it
more
than
quintupled
itself
in
eight
decades
does
it
not
require
much
fuller
demonstration
than
the
author
anywhere
presents
to
convince
the
ordinary
mind
that
a
people
that
has
shown
such
physical
vitality
for
so
long
a
period
has
all
at
once
in
a
single
decade
become
comparatively
infecund
and
threatened
with
extinction
it
is
passing
strange
that
it
escaped
the
attention
of
a
statistician
of
hoffman
sagacity
that
even
granting
the
accuracy
of
the
eleventh
census
the
natural
increase
of
the
negro
race
was
greater
than
that
of
the
whites
during
the
last
decade
the
number
of
immigrants
who
came
to
this
country
between
and
was
i
am
informed
by
the
census
bureau
that
this
number
does
not
include
the
immigrants
who
came
from
british
north
america
and
from
mexico
after
this
number
was
estimated
by
the
statistical
bureau
of
the
treasury
department
to
be
making
the
total
number
of
immigrants
if
this
number
be
subtracted
from
the
increase
of
the
white
population
during
the
last
decade
their
rate
of
increase
will
be
reduced
to
per
cent
as
compared
with
per
cent
for
the
blacks
nor
is
this
all
the
immigrants
were
for
the
most
part
in
the
full
maturity
and
vigor
of
their
productive
powers
being
the
most
fecund
element
of
our
white
population
if
allowance
be
made
for
their
natural
increase
from
to
the
white
race
would
show
a
decennial
increase
appreciably
below
that
of
the
blacks
if
the
negro
then
is
threatened
with
extinction
the
white
race
is
in
a
still
more
pitiable
plight
the
table
on
page
does
indeed
show
plainly
that
the
negro
does
not
hold
his
own
as
a
numerical
factor
of
our
mixed
population
whereas
he
represented
per
cent
of
the
entire
population
in
he
now
represents
only
per
cent
but
the
cause
of
this
relative
decline
is
apparent
enough
it
is
due
to
white
immigration
and
not
to
race
traits
as
hoffman
would
have
us
believe
it
would
be
as
legitimate
to
attribute
the
decline
of
the
yankee
element
as
a
numerical
factor
in
the
large
new
england
centers
to
the
race
degeneracy
of
the
puritan
while
ignoring
the
proper
cause
the
influx
of
the
celt
hoffman
conclusions
as
to
the
negro
population
are
not
generally
accepted
by
students
of
social
problems
their
position
is
more
clearly
stated
in
a
recent
notice
of
the
work
now
under
review
concerning
the
first
of
these
chapters
dealing
with
population
he
hoffman
reaches
conclusions
very
different
from
those
generally
held
by
those
who
have
discussed
the
subject
on
grounds
the
general
impression
has
been
that
the
colored
population
was
increasing
at
a
rate
greater
than
that
of
the
whites
owing
both
to
the
greater
number
of
children
born
and
also
to
the
fact
that
all
children
of
a
mixed
race
were
counted
as
blacks
from
such
a
condition
of
affairs
it
would
naturally
be
assumed
that
the
race
to
which
all
were
credited
would
especially
if
prolific
rapidly
gain
upon
the
other
race
on
the
appearance
of
each
census
since
emancipation
there
has
been
some
hue
and
cry
as
to
the
destiny
of
the
negro
population
public
opinion
has
been
rhythmical
with
reference
to
its
rise
and
fall
above
and
below
the
mean
line
of
truth
in
it
was
extermination
in
it
was
dreaded
that
the
whole
country
would
be
africanized
because
of
the
prolificness
of
a
barbarous
race
in
the
doctrine
of
extinction
was
preached
once
more
what
will
be
the
outcry
in
can
only
be
divined
at
this
stage
but
we
may
rest
assured
that
it
will
be
something
startling

the

studies
in
the
minor
features
of
the
negro
population
form
the
most
interesting
and
valuable
work
which
has
yet
been
undertaken
on
the
subject
the
urban
drift
the
tendency
to
concentration
and
the
migratory
movements
of
the
black
population
are
treated
with
fullness
and
force
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
there
are
cities
in
which
the
colored
population
exceeds
and
in
which
it
exceeds
and
that
the
rate
of
increase
of
the
colored
element
in
these
centers
is
enormous
more
than
per
cent
the
concentration
of
the
colored
population
in
certain
sections
of
cities
is
quite
suggestive
the
following

will
disclose

exhibited
at

this

is
found
to
be
greater

in
southern

every
large

its

and
its
black

which
the

knows
as

the
evil
of
this
tendency
can
not
be
denied
or
gainsaid
but
its
cause
is
not
far
to
seek
nor
hard
to
find
black

the
author
also
notes
with
alarm
that
the
negro
population
is
congesting
in
the
black
belts
of
the
south
there
are
counties
in

with
an
aggregate
area
of
over
square
miles
in
which
the
colored

outnumbers
the

the
general
conviction
is
that

states
the
superintendent
of
the
tenth
census
writes
on
this
subject
i
entertain
a
strong
conviction
that
the
further
course
of
our
negro
population
will
exhibit
that
tendency
in
a
continually
growing
force
that
this
element
will
be
more
and
more
drained
off
from
the
higher
and
colder
lands
into
the
low
hot
regions
bordering

of

commenting
on
this
subject
hoffman
says
this
tendency
if
persisted
in
will
probably
in
the
end
prove
disastrous
to
the
advancement
of
the
colored
race
since
there
is
but
the
slightest
prospect
that
the
race
will
be
lifted
to
a
higher
plane
of
civilization
except
by
constant
contact
with
the
white
race
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
the
negro
has
not
the
initiative
power
of
civilization
what
race
has
civilization
is
not
an
original
process
with
any
race
or
nation
known
to
history
the
torch
has
been
passed
from
race
to
race
and
from
age
to
age
where
else
can
the
negro
go
the
white
race
at
present
has
the
light
this
concession
is
no
reproach
to
the
negro
race
nor
is
it
due
to
any
peculiar
race
trait
or
tendency
there
is

a

of
nearly
souls
they
belong
for
the
most
part
to
the
most
thrifty
element
of
our
complex
population
an
element
whose
toughness
of
moral
and
mental
fiber
is
proverbial
the

over

yet
this

sunken
to
the
lowest
depth
of

a
depth
from
which
without
the
assistance

help
they
can
be
lifted
nevermore
is
this
condition
of
depravity
and
inability
of
due
to
race
traits
and
tendencies
then
supposing
the
negroes
to
be
concentrated
in
the
black
belts
as
seems
inevitable
will
they
necessarily
be
shut
out
from
wholesome
contact
with

not
at
all
just
how
far
personal
and
servile
contact
can
elevate
the
moral
and
manly
tone
of
a
people
is
not
quite
evident
but
the
result
of
indirect
missionary
contact
is
perhaps
the
surest
way
to
lift
a
race
into
civilization
i
point
to
japan
as
a
recent
striking
illustration
of
this
argument
the
black
belts
will
afford
the
richest
field
for
missionary
and
philanthropic
endeavor

may
well
be
considered
the
most
important
phase
of
the
race
problem
for
it
is
a
fact
which
can
and
will
be
demonstrated
by
indisputable
evidence
that
of
all
races
for
which
statistics
are
obtainable
and
which
enter
at
all
into
the
consideration
of
economic
problems
as
factors
the
negro
shows
the
least
power
of
resistance
in
the
struggle
for
life
death
rate
statistics
are
collected
from
ten
of
the
largest
cities
with
the
result
that
the
death
rate
among
the
whites
is
per
and
among
the
blacks
it
is
acknowledged
that
the
great
bulk
of
this
excess
in
the
colored
death
rate
is
due
to
infant
mortality
this
fact
of
itself
would
suggest
that
the
real
cause
is
condition
rather
than
race
traits
this
truth
shall
be
established
out
of
the
mouth
of
hoffman
own
witness
fifty
per
cent
of
the
negro
children
who
die
never
receive
medical
attention
the
indifference
to
medical
attendance
in
cases
of
illness
of
their
children
is
due
to
ignorance
to
the
ordinary
mind
this
would
imply
the
most
unfortunate
condition
birth
rate
but
the
death
rate
is
only
one
factor
in
the
vital
equation
the
birth
rate
is
equally
important
hoffman
concedes
with
reluctant
reservation
that
the
colored
birth
rate
may
be
greater
than
that
of
the
whites
that
the
birth
rate
of
the
negroes
is
in
excess
of
that
of
the
white
population
is
probably
true
even
at
the
present
time
at
least
as
compared
with
the
native
whites
this
is
indeed
a
very
feeble
admission
of
a
very
obvious
fact
hoffman
contends
that
the
death
rate
of
the
negro
race
is
much
greater
than
that
of
the
whites
it
has
already
been
shown
that
leaving
immigration
out
of
account
the
increase
in
the
negro
population
is
greater
than
that
of
the
white
race
how
can
these
two
facts
be
accounted
for
except
it
be
on
the
basis
of
a
higher
birth
rate
for
the
blacks
hoffman
will
have
either
to
alter
his
estimates
or
mend
his
logic
direct
testimony
on
this
subject
must
have
been
known
to
hoffman
of
course
no
one
is
qualified
to
write
on
vital
statistics
in
america
who
is
not
familiar
with
the
investigation
of
billings
let
the
reader
compare
the
following
quotation
as
to
the
relative
birth
rate
of
the
races
and
noting
date
of
data
upon
which
the
conclusion
is
based
decide
for
himself
as
to
the
ingenuousness
of
hoffman
reluctant
admission
billings
in
his
luminous
report
on
the
vital
statistics
of
the
united
states
shows
that
colored
women
age
from
to
give
birth
to
children
and
white
women
to
only
yearly
that
is
to
say
three
colored
women
have
as
many
children
as
four
white
is
the
negro
threatened
with
extinction
before
hoffman
conclusion
as
to
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
high
death
rate
of
the
negro
race
can
be
accepted
several
questions
must
be
answered
by
him
is
the
death
rate
of
the
colored
race
higher
than
that
of
a
corresponding
class
of
whites
subject
to
the
same
moral
and
social
environment
the
general
opinion
is
that
it
is
not
nor
does
the
author
attempt
to
prove
the
contrary
in
discussing
this
question
john
billings
states
if
we
could
separate
the
vital
statistics
of
the
poor
and
ignorant
whites
the
tenement
house
population
of
our
northern
cities
from
those
of
the
mass
of
the
white
population
we
should
undoubtedly
find
a
high
rate
of
mortality
in
this
class
and
especially
in
infancy
and
childhood
is
the
high
death
rate
for
the
cities
sustained
throughout
the
country
at
large
luckily
the
census
of
gives
a
complete
answer
to
this
question

of
the
united
states
in
was
per
south
carolina

mississippi
georgia
massachusetts
new

pennsylvania

this
shows
plainly
that
the
southern
states
with
the
largest
negro
contingent
do
not
show
any
higher
death
rate
than
the
northern
states
where
the
negro
is
not
a
considerable
factor
there
is
no
evidence
certainly
none
brought
forward
by
the
author
to
show
that
the
death
rate
of
the
negro
in
the
country
at
large
is
much
in
excess
of
that
of
the
whites
in
the
rural
districts
the
mortality
of
the
negro
is
not
excessive
it
is
in
the
cities
and
towns
where
he
is
brought
into
close
contact
with
the
evils
and
vices
of
civilization
that
he
dies
so
rapidly
is
the
death
rate
even
in
the
cities
so
great
as
to
foreshadow
extinction
nothing
is
great
or
small
except
by
comparison
the
death
rate
among
the
negroes
in
the
large
cities
at
present
is
not
as
great
as
it
was
among
the
whites
forty
years
ago
that
is

may
rely
upon

there
is
nothing
aside
from

the

can
do
which
the

can
not

sit

are

would
suffice
to
seal
its
fate
as
a
race
the
following
citation
will
express
the
truth
of
the
situation
as
clearly
as
it
is
possible
to
do
from
close
personal
observation
embracing
a
professional
life
of
nearly
forty
years
among
the
negroes
and
from
data
obtained
from
professional
brethren
in
different
sections
of
the
south
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
declaring
that
insanity
and
tuberculosis
were
rare
diseases
among
the
negroes
of
the
south
prior
to
emancipation
indeed
many
intelligent
people
of
observation
and
full
acquaintance
of
the
negro
have
stated
to
me
that
they
never
saw
a
crazy
or
consumptive
negro
of
unmixed
blood
until
these
latter
years
the
fact
of
their
comparative
exemption
from
these
ailments
prior
to
emancipation
is
so
well
established
man
is
an
organized
being
and
is
subject
to
certain
laws
which
he
can
not
violate
with
impunity
these
laws
affect
him
in
the
air
he
breathes
the
food
he
eats
the
clothes
he
wears
and
in
every
circumstance
surrounding
his
habilitation
in
the
wholesale
violation
of
these
laws
after
the
war
as
previously
stated
was
laid
the
foundation
of
the
degeneration
of
the

and
mental
condition

the

licentiousness
left
its
slimy
trail
of
sometimes
ineradicable
disease
upon
his
physical
being
and
neglected
bronchitis
pneumonia
and
pleurisy
lent
their
helping
hand
toward
lung
degeneration
it
will
be
noticed
that
miller
accepts
all
the
facts
alleged
by
our
author
but
places
the
causes
squarely
upon
the
ground
of
conditions
habits
and
circumstances
of
life
he
does
not
seem
to
be
acquainted
with
hoffman
discovery
of
race
traits
the
fact
that
under
the
hygienic
and
dietary
regime
of
slavery
consumption
was
comparatively
unknown
among
negroes
but
that
under
the
altered
conditions
of
emancipation
it
has
developed
to
a
threatening
degree
would
persuade
any
except
the
man
with
a
theory
that
the
cause
is
due
to
the
radical
changes
in
life
which
freedom
imposed
upon
the
blacks
rather
than
to
some
malignant
capricious
race
trait
which
is
not
amenable
to
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
but
which
graciously
suspended
its
operation
for
two
hundred
years
and
has
now
mysteriously
selected
the
closing
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
which
to
make
a
trial
of
its
direful
power
no
people
who
work
all
day
in
the
open
air
of
a
mild
climate
and
who
sleep
at
night
in
huts
and
cabins
where
crack
and
crevice
and
skylight
admit
abundant
ventilation
will
be
subject
to
pulmonary
weakness
now
take
the
same
people
and
transplant
them
to
the
large
cities
of
a
colder
climate
subject
them
to
pursuits
which
do
not
call
for
a
high
degree
of
bodily
energy
crowd
them
into
alley
tenements
where
the
windows
are
used
only
for
ornament
and
to
keep
out
the
night
air
and
a
single
door
must
serve
for
entrance
exit
and
ventilation
and
lung
degeneration
is
the
inevitable
result
the
cause
of
the
evil
suggests
the
remedy
the
author
in
a
previous
chapter
points
out
the
threatening
evil
of
crowding
into
the
cities
a
counter
movement
which
would
cause
a
return
to
the
country
or
would
at
least
stay
the
mad
urban
movement
would
not
only
improve
the
economic
status
of
the
race
but
would
also
benefit
its
physical
and
moral
health
here
is
an
open
field
for
practical
philanthropy
and
wise
negro
leadership
the
increase
in
consumption
among
negroes
is
indeed
a
grave
matter
but
it
is
possible
to
exaggerate
its
importance
as
sociological
evidence
if
we
listen
to
the
alarmists
and
social
agitators
we
would
find
a
hundred
causes
each
of
which
would
destroy
the
human
race
in
a
single
generation
the
most
encouraging
evidence
on
this
subject
from
the
negro
point
of
view
is
afforded
by
the
last
report
of
the
surgeon
general
of
the
united
states
army
the
statistics
thus
furnished
are
the
most
valuable
for
comparative
study
since
they
deal
with
the
two
races
on
terms
of
equality
that
is
the
white
and
colored
men
are
of
about
the
same
ages
and
initial
condition
of
health
they
receive
the
same
treatment
and
are
subject
to
the
same
diet
work
and
social
habits
it
is
to
be
noted
also
says
the
surgeon
general
that
during
the
past
two
years
the
rates
for
consumption
among
the
colored
troops
have
fallen
so
as
to
be
much
lower
than
those
for
the
whites
whereas
formerly
they
were
much
higher
the
following
table
prepared
by
hershaw
shows
plainly
the
gradual
decrease
of
the

it

that

this
being
so
there
is
no
need
of
unnecessary
alarm
over
a
single
factor
for
in

we
can
not
escape
the
fundamental
truth
that
the

is
greater
than

economic
efficiency
the
author
proposition
as
to
the
low
vitality
of
the
negro
and
its
effect
upon
his
economic
efficiency
is
contrary
alike
to
the
traditional
and
prevalent
belief
the
whole
fabric
of
slavery
rested
upon
the
assumption
that
the
negro
was
better
able
to
resist
the
trying
condition
of
the
southern
climate
than
the
white
laborer
the
industrial
reconstruction
of
the

is
building
upon
the

foundation
no
one
doubts
that
the
negro
is
able
to
resist

miasmatic

which
are

destructive

not
the

benefit

the

of
the
race

been
downward
ample
statistics
are
presented
to
show
that
in
proportion
to
structure
the
negro
is
heavier
than
the
white

this
fact
the

tells
us
is
ordinarily
considered
favorable
to
a
healthy
development

from

elaborate

of

in
the

in
and
the

in
prove
conclusively
that
low
weight
in
proportion
to
age
and
stature
is
a
determining
factor
in
the
susceptibility
of
an
individual
to
consumption
in
order
to
explain
away
this
apparent
advantage
in
favor
of
the
negro
the
author
has
invented
a
unique
physiological
principle
viz
a
physiological
law
may
hold
good
for
one
race
and
not
for
another
it
is
noticeable
that
the
author
applies
this
principle
only
when
it
suits
his
convenience
but
withholds
it
whenever
it
runs
across
his
theory
by
a
series
of
measurements
based
confessedly
upon
insufficient
data
it
is
concluded
that
the
negro
has
a
smaller
lung
capacity
smaller
chest
expansion
and
a
higher
rate
of
respiration
than
the
white
man
and
that
the
mulatto
is
inferior
to
both
the
parent
races
in
these
vital
functions
these
differences
are
considered
a
powerful
factor
in
lung
degeneration
and
proof
positive
of
physical
inferiority
in
these
respects
he
tacitly
repudiates
his
erstwhile
principle
that
a
physiological
law
may
hold
good
for
one
race
and
not
for
another
and
assumes
that
the
two
races
are
subject
to
like
conditions
of
disease
and
death
on
the
whole
it
may
be
said
that
this
is
the
least
interesting
chapter
in
the
whole
book
the
data
are
so
slender
and
the
arguments
are
so
evidently
shaped
to
a
theory
that
we
are
neither
enlightened
by
the
one
nor
convinced
by
the
other
but
the
author
judgment
must
be
justified
the
gloomy
warning
comes
with
catonian
regularity
at
the
end
of
each
chapter
listen
to
his
last
words
a
combination
of
these
traits
and
tendencies
must
in
the
end
cause
the
extinction
of
the
race
if
the
negro
is
inferior
in
vital
function
and
power
to
the
caucasian
he
will
be
a
public
benefactor
who
scientifically
demonstrates
the
fact
but
the
colored
race
most
stubbornly
refuses
to
be
argued
out
of
existence
on
an
insufficient
induction
of
data
and
unwarranted
conclusions
deduced
therefrom
chapter
iv
amalgamation
the
crossing
of
the
negro
race
with
the
white
has
been
detrimental
to
its
true
progress
and
has
contributed
more
than
anything
else
to
the
excessive
and
increasing
rate
of
mortality
from
the
most
fatal
disease
as
well
as
to
its
consequent
inferior
social
efficiency
and
diminishing
power
as
a
force
in
american
national
life
the
importance
of
this
proposition
is
apparent
when
we
consider
that
the
negroes
in
this
country
are
a
thoroughly
mixed
people
the
pure
african
type
has
been
well
nigh
obliterated
it
is
pointed
out
also
that
the
mongrel
progeny
has
been
produced
by
illicit
intercourse
between
the
white
male
and
the
black
female
the
moral
and
conservative
qualities
of
a
race
reside
in
its
womanhood
the
negro
people
then
have
missed
these
transmitted
qualities
the
author
is
either
ignorant
of
or
ignores
the
large
class
of
mixed
negroes
who
are
the
legitimate
offspring
of
colored
parents
but
would
place
the
whole
class
under
the
ban
of
bastardy
after
judicially
balancing
the
testimony
furnished
by
authorities
upon
the
effect
of
race
crossing
the
author
espouses
one
side
of
the
contention
with
all
the
ardor
of
a
retained
advocate
three
points
are
sought
to
be
established
i
the
mulatto
is
physically
inferior
to
both
parent
races
the
opinions
of
examining
surgeons
during
the
civil
war
are
quoted
which
quite
unanimously
show
that
the
mulatto
is
strongly
inclined
to
consumption
scrofula
and
vicious
taints
of
blood
the
following
table
made
out
on
the
basis
of
gould
measurements
is
full
of
interest
white
black
mulatto
weight

per

per

it
appears
from
this
table
that
in
the
most
important
vital
organs
and
functions
the
mulatto
is
inferior
to
both
parent
stocks
this
opinion
is
almost
or
quite
universal
among
competent
authorities
upon
this
subject
and
yet
the
last
word
of
science
has
not
been
uttered
on
this
question
there
is
no
subject
in
all
the
domain
of
social
science
which
offers
a
more
interesting
or
more
fruitful
field
for
investigation
the
freedmen
hospital
at
washington
and
similar
institutions
elsewhere
by
prosecuting
accurate
and
scientific
methods
of
inquiry
can
throw
much
light
upon
this
subject
the
mulatto
is
morally
inferior
to
the
blacks
this
alleged
inferiority
is
attributable
to
the
fact
as
well
as
to
the
manner
of
generation
strangely
enough
hoffman
does
not
employ
the
statistics
which
would
seem
to
bear
out
his
suggestion
the
eleventh
census
shows
that
there
were
pure
and
mixed
negroes
in
penitentiaries
in
supposing
that
uniform
methods
of
were
used
throughout
the
census
inquiry
this
would
show
that
while
the
mixed
negroes
constitute
only
per
cent
of
the
total
negro
population
they
furnished
percent
of
the
penitentiary
convicts
but
these
figures
can
not
be
relied
upon
since
the
census
bureau
acknowledges
that
it
has
no
definite
method
of
determining
the
different
shades
of
color
and
grades
of
mixture
among
negroes
it
is
also
alleged
in
proof
of
this
proposition
that
illicit
intercourse
between
the
races
is
carried
on
mainly
with
the
mulatto
women
can
this
not
be
explained
on
grounds
other
than
native
depravity
the
negro
woman
is
made
the
victim
of
the
lustful
onslaught
of
the
male
element
of
both
races
she
is
placed
between
the
upper
and
nether
stress
of
the
vicious
propensities
of
white
and
black
men
and
if
her
sins
are
greater
is
it
not
because
her
temptations
are
greater
also
the
following
quotation
from
a
distinguished
southerner
is
significant
there
was
little
improper
intercourse
between
white
men
and
negresses
of
the
original
type
in
the
period
before
emancipation
after
the
creation
of
the
mulatto
class
every
time
a
negro
woman
is
indicted
on
this
score
some
white
man
is
inculpated
the
reproach
hurled
against
colored
women
from
such
sources
reminds
us
very
much
of
the
lines
in
butler
hudibras
the
selfsame
thing
they
will
abhor
one
way
and
long
another
for
the
mulatto
is
intellectually
superior
to
the
blacks
but
inferior
to
the
whites
in
substantiation
of
this
proposition
it
is
claimed
that
the
greater
number
of
negroes
who
have
attained
distinction
have
been
those
of
mixed
blood
the
truth
of
this
statement
must
be
conceded
and
yet
the
cause
should
not
be
overlooked
leaving
aside
the
doctrine
of
inheritance
as
a
debatable
question
the
initial
advantage
of
the
mixed
over
the
pure
negroes
was
considerable
feelings
of
blood
ties
prompted
many
a
slave
holder
to
deal
kindly
by
his
slave
descendants
and
often
to
liberate
them
and
give
them
a
start
in
the
race
of
life
that
an
infusion
of
white
blood
quickens
the
energy
and
enlivens
the
disposition
of
the
progeny
is
probably
true
but
that
it
adds
to
the
intellectual
capacity
is
far
from
a
proposition
the
negroes
who
have
shown
any
unusual
intellectual
activity
in
america
at
least
have
usually
been
of
the
purer
type
phyllis
wheatly
benjamin
banneker
ira
aldridge
blind
tom
edward
blyden
and
paul
dunbar
are
illustrations
of
this
argument
the
investigation
of
gould
as
to
circumference
of
head
and
facial
angle
are
exhibited
in
the
following
table
white
mulatto
black
circumference

inches
inches
facial

a
difference
of
of
an
inch
in
head
circumference
and
of
of
a
degree
in
facial
angle
affords
a
very
slender
physical
basis
on
which
to
predicate
intellectual
superiority
the
author
lays
great
stress
upon
the
following
table
made
out
by
hunt
of
the
brain
of
white
and
colored

the

thus
obtained
is
confidently
relied
upon
nor
are
we
informed
as
to
what
methods
were
employed
to
ascertain
the
exact
composition
of
blood
of
the
cases
that
are
rated
as
white
but
supposing
we
accept
this
table
overlooking
for
the
time
being
the
fact
that
the
brain
weight
of
one
white
person
is
taken
as
typical
of
two
million
others
and
also
conceding
the
undisclosed
method
of
hunt
in
detecting
homeopathic
dashes
of
white
blood
does
it
clearly
prove
that
there
is
an
increase
in
the
brain
weight
with
an
increase
in
the
proportion
of
white
blood
if
this
table
shows
anything
it
is
that
the
pure
negro
and
the
mulatto
have
about
the
same
brain
weight
and
that
they
are
both
superior
in
this
respect
to
all
degrees
of
mixture
between
them
but
inferior
to
those
of
more
than
white
blood
but
it
is
rather
unusual
at
this
late
day
to
base
intellectual
capacity
upon
the
shape
and
size
of
skull
investigations
have
shown
that
facial
angle
and
capacity
of
cranium
and
cephalic
index
afford
no
certain
criterion
of
thought
power
or
susceptibility
to
culture
the
latest
word
on
this
subject
is
given
by
ripley
in
a
series
of
articles
on
racial
geography
of
europe
in
appleton
popular
science
monthly
for
an
important
point
to
be
noted
in
this
connection
is
that
this
shape
of
the
head
seems
to
bear
no
direct
relation
to
intellectual
power
or
intelligence
posterior
development
of
the
cranium
does
not
imply
a
corresponding
backwardness
in
culture
europe
offers
the
best
refutation
of
the
statement
that
the
proportions
of
the
head
mean
anything
intellectual
in
our
study
of
the
proportions
of
the
head
therefore
we
are
measuring
merely
race
and
not
intelligence
in
any
sense
equally
unimportant
to
the
anthropologist
is
the
absolute
size
of
the
head
it
is
grievous
to
contemplate
the
waste
of
energy
when
during
our
civil
war
over
one
million
of
soldiers
had
their
heads
measured
in
respect
to
this
absolute
size
in
view
of
the
fact
that
today
anthropologists
deny
any
considerable
significance
attaching
to
this
characteristic
popularly
a
large
head
with
beetling
eyebrows
suffices
to
establish
a
man
intellectual
credit
but
like
all
other
credit
it
is
entirely
dependent
upon
what
lies
on
deposit
elsewhere
a
still
more
renowned
authority
tells
us
the
development
of
the
intellectual
faculties
of
man
is
to
a
great
extent
independent
of
the
capacity
of
the
cranium
and
the
volume
of
the
brain
the
question
of
the
relative
intellectual
capacity
of
the
different
races
is
one
of
much
speculative
interest
i
am
giving
the
matter
more
attention
than
it
would
seem
to
warrant
because
the
author
makes
the
supposed
mental
inferiority
of
the
race
the
basis
of
the
only
practical
suggestion
which
he
has
to
offer
viz
that
all
of
our
educational
and
philanthropic
endeavor
so
far
has
been
based
upon
wrong
principles
and
a
radical
change
in
this
regard
is
demanded
so
as
to
bring
the
treatment
in
harmony
with
the
capabilities
of
the
lower
race
several
authorities
will
be
cited
which
i
think
will
be
more
than
sufficient
to
offset
hoffman
insistent
opinion
there
are
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
black
men
in
this
country
who
in
capacity
are
to
be
ranked
with
the
superior
persons
of
the
dominant
race
and
it
is
hard
to
say
that
in
any
evident
feature
of
mind
they
characteristically
differ
from
their
white
fellow
citizens
shaler
is
himself
a
southerner
a
professor
in
harvard
university
and
a
noted
student
of
current
problems
granting
the
present
inferiority
of
the
negro
we
affirm
that
it
has
never
been
proved
nor
is
there
any
good
reason
to
suppose
that
he
is
doomed
forever
to
maintain
his
present
relative
position
or
that
he
is
inferior
to
the
white
man
in
any
other
sense
than
as
some
white
races
are
inferior
to
others
yet
the
negro
children
exhibit
no
intellectual
inferiority
they
make
just
the
same
progress
in
the
subjects
taught
as
do
the
children
of
white
parents
and
the
deficiency
they
exhibit
later
in
life
is
of
quite
a
different
kind
hoffman
compels
us
once
more
to
combat
the
arguments
of
the
slave
holding
class
that
is
that
the
negro
is
intellectually
and
morally
an
inferior
creature
they
did
not
however
affirm
physical
inferiority
and
that
it
is
only
by
servile
contact
with
the
white
race
that
his
nature
can
be
improved
the
progress
along
these
lines
which
the
race
has
made
even
under
the
severest
disadvantages
is
sufficient
answer
to
this
argument
if
i
designed
yon
lordling
slave
by
nature
law
designed
why
was
an
independent
wish
planted
in
my
mind
the
negro
intellectual
and
social
environments
hang
as
a
millstone
about
his
neck
and
when
he
is
cast
upon
the
sea
of
opportunity
he
is
reproached
with
everlasting
inferiority
because
he
does
not
swim
an
equal
race
with
those
who
are
not
thus
fettered
we
are
reminded
of
the
barbarous
teutons
in
titus
andronicus
who
after
pulling
out
the
tongue
and
cutting
off
the
hands
of
the
lovely
lavinia
upbraid
her
for
not
calling
for
sweet
water
with
which
to
wash
her
delicate
hands
no
no
hoffman
the
philanthropists
have
made
no
mistake
they
have
proceeded
on
the
supposition
that
the
negro
has
faculty
for
faculty
and
power
for
power
with
the
rest
of
his
fellow
men
and
that
his
special
needs
grow
out
of
his
peculiar
condition
any
alteration
in
this
policy
would
violate
the
dictates
both
of
science
and
humanity
mixed
marriages
the
remainder
of
this
rather
long
chapter
is
devoted
to
the
number
and
character
of
mixed
marriages
with
the
conclusion
that
the
number
is
on
the
decrease
and
the
character
of
one
or
both
of
the
contracting
parties
is
usually
unsavory
and
that
such
unions
can
form
no
determining
factor
in
the
ultimate
solution
of
the
problem
a
study
of
the
fertility
of
such
marriages
and
the
physical
moral
and
intellectual
stamina
of
the
progeny
would
furnish
valuable
sociological
data

the
author
announces
with
an
implied
negative
response
to
the
suppressed
question
it
remains
to
be
shown
whether
the
educational
process
which
the
race
has
undergone
during
the
past
quarter
of
a
century
and
the
additional
efforts
and
opportunities
for
religious
instruction
have
materially
raised
the
race
from
its
low
social
and
economic
condition
at
the
time
of
emancipation

statement
needs
no
refutation

it
will
fall
beneath
the
ponderous
weight
of
its
own
absurdity

examine

the

and
black
literally
the
law
is
the
same
for
all
then
what
more
can
be
desired
the
trouble
is
not
that
the
laws
are
partial
through
some
of
its
enactments
namely
the
and
laws
were
aimed
principally
against
the
negro
but
the
trouble
is
with
the
interpretation
of
the
laws
by
the
juries
who
merely
voice
the
public
sentiment
which
is
superior
to
the
law
itself
the
average
jury
is
a
whimsical
creature
subject
to
all
kinds
of
influences
though
mostly
of
a
sentimental
character
in
criminal
matters
where
whites
are
concerned
it
seems
ever
to
lean
to
the
defense
and
the
strongest
arguments
of
the
prosecution
are
easily
offset
and
upset
by
appeals
on
behalf
of
youth
family
station
respectability
etc
or
perhaps
the
whole
family
weeping
is
placed
in
full
view
of
the
jury
and
the
susceptible
jury
sure
at
least
in
such
cases
to
weep
with
them
that
weep
speedily
brings
in
a
verdict
of
acquittal
where
guilt
is
clearly
manifest
or
it
says
jail
where
it
ought
to
say
penitentiary
or
one
year
where
it
ought
to
say
ten
and
ten
years
where
it
ought
to
pronounce
death
but
the
negro
has
none
of
these
sentimental
advantages
too
poor
to
employ
competent
counsel
his
liberty
and
life
are
necessarily
committed
to
incompetent
hands
when
the
proverb
of
pay
poor
preach
becomes
reality
but
are
negroes
treated
unfairly
by
juries
and
public
opinion
yes
and
the
experience
and
observation
of
every
man
will
confirm
the
assertion
one
cardinal
proof
is
that
a
white
man
seldom
receives
punishment
for
assault
however
brutal
however
unprovoked
however
cowardly
be
it
maiming
homicide
or
murder
upon
a
negro
unless
forsooth
the
assailant
be
some
degraded
creature
disowned
by
his
own
caste
of
the
numberless
instances
running
into
the
thousands
during
the
past
years
of
homicide
and
murder
of
blacks
by
whites
there
is
no
single
instance
of
capital
punishment
and
few
very
few
instances
of
imprisonment
beyond
a
few
months
in
jail
or
a
slight
fine
the
fact
is
the
juries
which
are
the
sole
judges
of
the
evidence
will
accept
testimony
against
a
negro
that
they
would
reject
in
the
case
of
whites
and
on
the
other
hand
they
will
frequently
reject
or
at
least
discredit
testimony
of
the
negro
against
the
white
man
however
well
supported
it
may
be
but
to
compound
for
sins
we
are
inclined
to
by
damning
those
we
have
no
mind
to
in
case
of
any
difficulty
between
white
and
black
and
the
former
is
injured
or
loses
his
life
lucky
is
the
latter
if
the
homicide
is
not
declared
murder
when
courts
of
justice
though
sure
to
inflict
the
highest
penalty
in
his
case
are
found
to
be
too
slow
and
he
is
dragged
forth
and
slain
unshrived
and
unshriven
as
if
he
were
a
monstrous
wild
beast
of
whose
presence
earth
could
not
be
rid
too
quickly
the
social
degradation
of
the
negro
is
the
greatest
factor
contributive
to
this
high
criminal
record
we
naturally
associate
poverty
ignorance
and
crime
as
being
indissolubly
connected
the
negroes
represent
the
stratum
of
society
which
commits
the
bulk
of
crime
the
world
over
if
we
exchange
places
the
same
story
would
be
narrated
of
the
whites
the
census
records
nowhere
show
that
there
is
any
connection
between
crime
and
race
but
between
crime
and
condition
the
negro
has
a
higher
criminal
record
than
the
caucasian
it
is
true
but
so
has
the
foreigner
a
greater
average
than
the
native
whites
the
strongest
possible
argument
in
this
connection
rests
upon
the
fact
that
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
negroes
in
any
community
does
not
increase
its
total
criminal
average
the
north
atlantic
division
including
the
states
of
maine
new
hampshire
vermont
massachusetts
rhode
island
connecticut
new
york
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
has
a
criminal
record
of
to
the
million
while
the
south
atlantic
division
including
the
states
of
the
southern
atlantic
coast
shows
a
record
of
the
western
division
has
an
average
of
the
section
that
has
the
fewest
negroes
has
the
highest
average
and
the
states
that
have
the
largest
quota
of
blacks
show
the
lowest
criminal
rates
if
we
compare
state
with
state
the
same
interesting
results
are
revealed
the
criminal
record
of
new
york
million
basis
is
of
south
carolina
of
california
of
alabama
but
says
the
objector
a
difference
in
the
rigidity
of
the
enforcement
of
the
law
may
account
in
some
measure
for
this
disparity
let
us
then
take
the
city
of
washington
of
whose
population
are
negroes
and
compare
its
police
reports
with
those
of
boston
whose
negro
element
is
a
negligible
fraction
it
will
be
conceded
i
think
that
the
enforcement
of
law
in
both
cities
is
rigid
the
major
of
police
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
his
last
report
remarks
those
familiar
with
the
conduct
of
police
affairs
in
this
country
generally
contend
that
there
is
a
constant
increase
of
crime
that
it
keeps
pace
with
the
growing
population
while
such
may
be
true
of
the
principal
cities
of
the
united
states
facts
and
figures
support
the
claim
of
this
department
that
in
this
respect
the
district
of
columbia
occupies
a
distinct
standing
of
its
own
its
comprehensive
moral
status
is
above
that
of
most
communities
were
it
not
for
the
depredations
chargeable
to
theft
there
would
be
comparatively
little
crime
to
chronicle
this
offense
must
always
exist
here
unless
through
some
unexpected
agency
a
complete
change
should
be
effected
in
the
social
conditions
which
prevail
the
abiding
place
of
a
large
class
of
idle
illiterate
and
consequently
vicious
persons
it
is
but
reasonable
that
the
respectable
element
should
be
preyed
upon
to
a
considerable
extent
the
percentage
of
arrests
for
boston
during
was
whereas
for
washington
it
was
only
and
a
fraction
these
facts
would
seem
to
furnish
sufficient
evidence
that
crime
adheres
to
circumstances
and
condition
and
not
to
race
and
color
but
says
the
author
in
the
north
where
legal
processes
are
acknowledgly
fair
so
far
as
the
negro
is
concerned
the
race
shows
a
criminal
record
which
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
numerical
strength
in
pennsylvania
per
cent
of
its
population
commit
per
cent
of
the
crimes
in
chicago
of
the
population
are
responsible
for
of
the
offenses
and
so
for
other
northern
communities
the
negro
criminal
status
is
from
six
to
eight
times
greater
than
his
numerical
weight
it
has
been
shown
in
another
place
that
from
a
social
and
economic
standpoint
the
northern
negro
is
completely
submerged
the
criminal
outbreak
under
the
circumstances
is
only
natural
it
is
also
true
that
where
numbers
are
small
proportions
are
high
the
startling
criminal
showing
of
the
northern
negro
can
be
accounted
for
largely
on
this
principle
suppose
that
there
were
but
one
chinaman
in
a
community
and
coming
as
he
naturally
would
into
hostile
contact
with
a
wide
area
he
should
be
arrested
and
convicted
the
criminal
records
of
that
community
would
show
that
one
hundred
per
cent
of
the
chinese
population
belonged
to
the
criminal
class
i
append
the
following
table
extracted
from
the
census
of
to
establish
this
principle
the
negro
in
the
country
at
large
shows
a
much
higher
criminal
rate
than
the
foreign
whites
but
if
we
limit
our
inquiry
to
those
states
where
the
foreign
population
is
small
the
conditions
will
be
reversed
of
prisoners
in
several
southern
states
to
the
million
of
population
state
foreign
white
colored
florida
georgia
louisiana
mississippi
if
on
the
other
hand
we
select
those
states
in
which
the
negro
element
is
small
and
the
foreign
element
large
the
result
is
very
decidedly
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
negro
the
northern
negro
has
a
criminal
record
which
is
not
only
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
numerical
strength
but
is
two
or
three
times
as
great
as
that
of
his
black
brothers
in
the
south
it
is
hard
to
see
how
race
traits
could
account
for
this
discrepancy
rape
and
lynching
the
attempts
at
rape
and
the
consequent
lynchings
are
also
offered
in
evidence
of
the
evil
propensity
of
the
race
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
the
alleged
assaults
upon
white
women
by
colored
men
have
done
more
than
all
other
causes
combined
to
give
the
race
an
evil
reputation
and
make
it
loathsome
in
the
eyes
of
mankind
it
throws
over
every
colored
man
a
mantle
of
odium
and
sets
upon
him
a
mark
for
popular
hate
more
distressing
than
the
mark
set
upon
the
first
murderer
it
has
cooled
our
friends
and
heated
our
enemies
the
alleged
culprit
in
such
cases
especially
if
he
be
a
colored
man
and
the
victim
a
white
woman
is
almost
certain
to
die
without
due
process
of
law
the
native
savage
furor
of
human
nature
asserts
itself
in
the
presence
of
such
dastardly
outrages
and
neither
legal
enactments
nor
moral
codes
nor
religious
sanction
can
restrain
it
the
perpetrators
can
not
be
defended
or
pitied
it
is
a
waste
of
sympathy
to
wail
over
the
deep
damnation
of
their
taking
off
and
yet
we
must
remember
that
when
the
two
races
are
concerned
rape
has
a
larger
definition
than
is
set
down
in
the
dictionaries
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
there
have
been
many
lynchings
chargeable
to
rape
when
the
true
cause
should
be
designated
by
a
different
though
an
ugly
name
let
us
not
forget
also
that
not
more
than
of
the
lynchings
are
even
chargeable
to
rape
the
causes
include
the
whole
catalogue
of
offenses
serious
and
trifling
from
the
committal
of
murder
to
jostling
against
a
white
man
on
the
street
the
attempt
to
show
that
lynching
and
rape
are
coextensive
is
misleading
and
unjust
so
the
effort
to
show
that
rapeful
assaults
are
due
to
race
traits
can
i
think
be
clearly
disproved
in
a
pamphlet
which
is
certainly
not
flattering
to
the
negro
a
learned
medical
authority
tells
us
i
might
remark
in
passing
that
notwithstanding
the
horrible
crimes
perpetrated
under
the
influence
of
the
by
the
negro
i
believe
that
he
compares
quite
favorably
as
regards
sexual
impulses
taking
all
abnormalities
into
consideration
with
the
white
race
the
more
i
see
of
white
men
in
refined
society
the
more
contempt
have
i
for
quite
a
large
proportion
of
male
humanity
to
summarize
the
points
of
the
argument
showing
that
rape
is
not
peculiarly
characteristic
of
the
negro
rape
has
been
practiced
among
all
races
and
nations
the
committal
of
rape
by
white
men
is
by
no
means
an
infrequent
occurrence
two
instances
of
white
men
committing
heinous
assaults
upon
white
children
occurred
in
washington
during
the
preparation
of
this
article
in
africa
rape
is
so
severely
punished
that
it
is
comparatively
unknown
in
the
british
islands
and
in
south
america
where
the
negroes
live
in
greatest
relative
abundance
the
crime
is
unheard
of
when
the
care
and
safety
of
the
white
women
of
the
south
were
entrusted
to
the
keeping
of
the
slaves
they
returned
inviolable
all
that
had
been
entrusted
to
their
hands
of
the
hundreds
of
lady
missionaries
of
the
north
who
have
trusted
their
lives
and
virtue
to
the
emancipated
race
whom
they
came
to
uplift
not
a
single
case
of
violation
has
been
reported
to
their
friends
at
the
north
social
morality
the
present
state
of
social
morality
is
mirrored
in
the
number
of
illegitimate
offsprings
the
figures
which
show
that
the
rate
of
illegitimacy
among
negroes
in
washington
has
increased
from
per
cent
of
total
births
in
to
per
cent
in
have
been
widely
quoted
and
remarked
upon
these
are
facts
of
record
and
can
not
be
gainsaid
or
denied
according
to
the
opinion
of
medical
men
and
others
in
positions
to
observe
these
figures
if
anything
fall
short
of
the
truth
it
is
also
probable
that
the
other
large
cities
of
the
country
if
as
closely
studied
would
make
as
startling
a
showing
the
only
alarming
feature
of
the
situation
is
the
constant
in
the
illegitimate
rates
that
per
cent
of
the
births
among
negroes
are
illegitimate
will
not
alarm
anyone
where
it
is
considered
that
even
this
low
moral
status
represents
a
gain
of
per
cent
over
the
conditions
prevailing
under
slavery
hoffman
having
on
hand
a
theory
was
spared
the
pains
of
inquiring
further
into
the
causes
which
led
to
this
deplorable
state
of
things
the
reviewer
suggests
that
this
increase
in
social
immorality
among
the
negroes
of
washington
is
due
to
the
great
rush
of
ignorant
purposeless
colored
people
to
the
national
capital
a
condition
of
things
which
always
leads
in
its
first
effect
to
social
looseness
and
impurity
the
very
late
marriages
among
the
better
element
of
the
colored
people
also
help
to
account
for
this
awful
state
of
things
but
perhaps
a
greater
than
any
cause
yet
assigned
as
leading
to
the
social
degradation
of
negroes
in
cities
is
the
excess
of
the
female
over
the
male
element
of
the
population
on
account
of
the
importance
of
this
subject
i
append
a
table

this
excess
for

total
such
a
disproportion
between

can
forbode
no
good
to
society
in
the
west
where
the
male
element
predominates
over
the
female
among
the
white
population
the
evil
effect
on
society
is
painfully
apparent
if
every
colored
man
in
washington
were
married
and
every
male
minor
had
a

selected
for
him
there
would
still
be
left
negro
females
enough

form

now
no
one
should
wonder
at
the
moral
corruption
under
these
circumstances
these
females
for
whom
marriage
is
impossible

it
remembered
are
not
restrained
by
the
inhibitory
influence
of
pride
station
and
this
is
no
doubt
the
greatest
evil
which
threatens
the
social
integrity
of
negro
life
and
forms
the
most
serious
and
perplexing
of
our
city
problems
as
startling
as
the
records
of
crime
and
immorality
are
they
are
only
the
outgrowth
of
circumstances
and
conditions
human
nature
at
best
is
weak
and
under
fostering
circumstances
has
always
yielded
to
the
power
of
sin
and
uncleanliness
the
author
tells
us
that
immorality
is
a
race
trait
this
is
sadly
too
true
but
it
is
a
human
race
trait
and
is
limited
to
no
particular
variety

chapter
vi
economic
conditions
as
a
general
conclusion
it
may
be
said
that
the
negro
has
not
yet
learned
the
first
element
of
thrift
the
negro
as
a
farm
hand
attempt
is
made
to
show
that
the
negro
has
deteriorated
as
a
farm
laborer
and
that
as
an
industrial
factor
he
has
not
held
his
own
in
the
development
of
the
resources
of
the
south
with
a
process
of
reasoning
with
which
we
are
fully
familiar
by
this
time
these
assertions
are
sought
to
be
upheld
the
decline
in
agricultural
interests
throughout
the
country
has
had
its
effect
upon
the
apparent
efficiency
of
the
farming
class
everywhere
the
mad
rush
to
the
cities
with
a
vain
hope
of
improvement
in
condition
has
well
nigh
demoralized
agricultural
pursuits
the
negro
as
an
industrial
factor
the
investigations
which
have
been
undertaken
to
determine
the
industrial
efficiency
of
the
negro
have
shown
results
not
unfavorable
to
him
the
recent
discharge
of
white
workmen
in
the
cotton
mills
of
charleston
and
the
substitution
of
colored
workmen
in
their
places
is
quite
significant
the
hindrances
which
the
negro
has
to
meet
in
the
industrial
field
are
fully
suggested
in
the
address
to
the
public
of
the
discharged
white
employes
of
the
charleston
establishment
if
the
colored
man
status
precludes
him
from
competing
with
the
it
should
exclude
him
from
competing
with
our
wives
sons
and
daughters
in
the
light
pursuits
of
the
country
we
affirm
by
our
physical
powers
and
brave
hearts
not
to
sit
supinely
by
and
witness
this
negro
horde
turned
loose
upon
the
pursuits
of
our
mothers
our
wives
our
widows
our
daughters
our
sisters
and
rob
them
of
their
living
this
is
the
solemn
declaration
of
workmen
in
the
metropolis
of
south
carolina
and
represents
fairly
the
white
labor
sentiment
of
the
south
the
trades
unions
and
labor
organizations
preach
the
same
doctrine
if
the
alleged
low
industrial
efficiency
of
the
negro
is
to
be
chargeable
to
race
traits
it
should
be
attributed
to
the
domineering
and
intolerant
race
traits
of
the
white
workmen
who
are
not
disposed
to
give
the
colored
man
a
fair
chance
the
fact
that
in
almost
every
contention
between
white
and
colored
workmen
the
employers
take
the
side
of
the
negro
is
an
eloquent
argument
in
behalf
of
the
industrial
merits
of
the
latter
for
these
employers
are
in
the
business
for
profit
and
not
for
philanthropy
accumulation
of
property
the
accumulation
of
property
on
the
part
of
the
blacks
shows
that
in
georgia
they
own
in
north
carolina
and
in
virginia
the
land
held
by
the
colored
people
in
virginia
alone
has
an
area
nearly
equal
to
that
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
these
facts
make
a
decidedly
favorable
showing
chapter
vii
conclusion
the
need
of
this
chapter
is
hardly
apparent
for
the
author
conclusion
is
as
clearly
set
forth
in
the
beginning
as
at
the
close
of
the
treatise
as
to
his
leading
conclusion
the
author
is
not
only
out
of
harmony
with
the
general
opinion
prevalent
among
students
of
the
negro
problem
but
is
also
strangely
inconsistent
with
his
former
self
the
same
author
who
in
wrote
it
is
not
in
the
condition
of
life
but
in
the
race
traits
and
tendencies
that
we
find
the
cause
of
excessive
mortality
in
affirmed
the
colored
population
is
placed
at
many
disadvantages
which
it
can
not
very
well
remove
the
unsanitary
condition
of
their
dwellings
their
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
health
and
general
poverty
are
the
principal
causes
of
their
high
mortality
the
frederick
hoffman
of
according
to
the
general
judgment
is
much
nearer
the
true
analysis
than
the
frederick
hoffman
of
the
author
conclusion
will
not
stand
the
philosophical
tests
of
a
sound
theory
it
is
based
upon
disputed
data
the
accuracy
of
the
eleventh
census
is
not
acceptable
either
to
the
popular
or
the
scientific
mind
it
is
not
based
upon
a
sufficient
induction
of
data
the
arguments
at
most
apply
to
the
negroes
in
the
large
cities
who
constitute
less
than
per
cent
of
the
total
population
it
does
not
account
for
the
facts
arranged
under
it
as
satisfactorily
as
can
be
done
under
a
different
hypothesis
the
author
fails
to
consider
that
the
discouraging
facts
of
observation
may
be
due
to
the
violent
upheaval
of
emancipation
and
reconstruction
and
are
therefore
only
temporary
in
their
duration
i
do
not
know
whether
the
author
believes
in
providence
as
a
determining
factor
in
society
or
not
it
may
not
be
accounted
scientific
to
take
cognizance
of
any
element
which
can
not
be
quantified
counted
weighed
or
measured
but
i
do
know
that
the
wisest
of
our
species
have
always
believed
that
god
is
the
controlling
factor
in
human
affairs
the
negro
hopes
and
aspirations
are
built
upon
the
foundation
of
this
belief
we
are
told
in
his
word
that
he
visits
the
sins
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
if
the
negro
then
will
conform
his
life
to
the
moral
and
sanitary
laws
may
not
the
evil
tendencies
now
observable
be
eradicated
or
overcome
the
first
effects
of
emancipation
are
always
harmful
to
the
moral
and
physical
of
the
liberated
class
the
removal
of
physical
restraints
before
moral
restraints
have
grown
strong
enough
to
take
their
place
must
always
result
in
misconduct
the
jews
in
egypt
labored
under
circumstances
remarkably
similar
to
those
of
the
american
negro
after
their
emancipation
it
required
them
forty
years
to
make
the
progress
which
the
scientific
process
would
have
required
them
to
make
in
forty
days
such
was
their
moral
and
physical
degeneracy
that
only
two
persons
of
all
the
hosts
who
left
the
land
of
egyptian
bondage
survived
to
reach
the
promised
land
forty
years
afterward
luckily
for
the
hebrews
there
were
no
statisticians
in
those
days
think
of
the
future
which
an
egyptian
philosopher
would
have
predicted
for
this
people
and
yet
out
of
the
loins
of
this
race
have
sprung
the
moral
and
spiritual
of
mankind
we
should
not
be
discouraged
because
the
negro
does
not
make
a
from
egyptian
bondage
to
the
promised
land
beyond
the
jordan
he
too
must
tarry
awhile
in
the
wilderness
before
he
enters
upon
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
heritage
of
freedom
to
the
negro
i
would
say
let
him
not
be
discouraged
at
the
ugly
facts
which
confront
him
the
sociologists
are
flashing
the
searchlight
of
scientific
inquiry
upon
him
his
faults
lie
nearer
the
surface
and
are
more
easily
detected
than
those
of
the
white
race
let
him
not
be
overwhelmed
when
all
his
faults
are
observed
set
in
a
note
book
learned
and
conned
by
rote
to
be
cast
into
his
teeth
if
all
the
ugly
facts
about
any
people
were
brought
to
light
they
would
furnish
an
unpleasant
record
when
the
savior
told
the
woman
of
samaria
all
that
she
ever
did
a
very
unsavory
career
was
disclosed
if
all
the
misdeeds
of
any
people
or
individual
were
brought
to
light
the
best
of
the
race
would
be
injured
and
the
rest
would
be
ruined
the
negro
should
accept
the
facts
with
becoming
humility
and
strive
to
live
in
closer
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
human
and
divine
law
he
does
not
labor
under
a
destiny
of
death
from
which
there
is
no
escape
it
is
a
condition
and
not
a
theory
that
confronts
him
