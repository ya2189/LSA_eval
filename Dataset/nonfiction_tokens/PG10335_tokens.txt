i
am
indebted
to
the
editors
of
scribner
magazine

cosmopolitan
and

for
permission
to
reprint
the
three
essays
which
have
appeared
in
their
pages
the
others
are
published
for
the
first
time
it
may
be
well
to
ward
off
the
full
seriousness
of
my
title
nursery
logic
by
saying
that
a
certain
informality
in
all
of
these
papers
arises
from
the
fact
that
they
were
originally
talks
given
before
members
of
societies
interested
in
the
training
of
children

or

the
subject
of
children
rights
does
not
provoke
much
sentimentalism
in
this
country
where
as
somebody
says
the
present
problem
of
the
children
is
the
painless
extinction
of
their
elders
i
interviewed
the
man
who
washes
my
windows
the
other
morning
with
the
purpose
of
getting
at
the
level
of
his
mind
in
the
matter
dennis
i
said
as
he
was
polishing
the
glass
i
am
writing
an
article
on
the
of
children
what
do
you
think
about
it
dennis
carried
his
forefinger
to
his
head
in
search
of
an
idea
for
he
is
not
accustomed
to
having
his
intelligence
so
violently
assaulted
and
after
a
moment
puzzled
thought
he
said
what
do
i
think
about
it
mum
why
i
think
we
ought
to
give
to
but
lor
mum
if
we
do
they
so
what
the
odds
and
as
he
left
the
room
i
thought
he
looked
pained
that
i
should
spin
words
and
squander
ink
on
such
a
topic
the
french
dressmaker
was
my
next
victim
as
she
fitted
the
collar
of
an
effete
civilization
on
my
nineteenth
century
neck
i
put
the
same
question
i
had
given
to
dennis
the
rights
of
the
child
madame
she
asked
her
scissors
poised
in
air
yes
the
rights
of
the
child
is
it
of
the
american
child
madame
yes
said
i
nervously
of
the
american
child
mon
dieu
he
has
them
this
may
well
lead
us
to
consider
rights
as
opposed
to
privileges
a
multitude
of
privileges
or
rather
indulgences
can
exist
with
a
total
disregard
of
the
child
rights
you
remember
the
man
who
said
he
could
do
without
necessities
if
you
would
give
him
luxuries
enough
the
child
might
say
i
will
forego
all
my
privileges
if
you
will
only
give
me
my
rights
a
little
less
sentiment
please
more
justice
there
are
women
who
live
in
perfect
puddles
of
maternal
love
who
yet
seem
incapable
of
justice
generous
to
a
fault
perhaps
but
seldom
just
owns
the
if
the
parent
owns
him
mind
body
and
soul
we
must
adopt
one
line
of
argument
if
as
a
human
being
he
owns
himself
we
must
adopt
another
in
my
thought
the
parent
is
simply
a
divinely
appointed
guardian
who
acts
for
his
child
until
he
attains
what
we
call
the
age
of
discretion
that
highly
uncertain
period
which
arrives
very
late
in
life
with
some
persons
and
not
at
all
with
others
the
rights
of
the
parent
being
almost
unlimited
it
is
a
very
delicate
matter
to
decide
just
when
and
where
they
infringe
upon
the
rights
of
the
child
there
is
no
standard
the
child
is
the
creature
of
circumstances
the
mother
can
clothe
him
in
jaeger
wool
from
head
to
foot
or
keep
him
in
low
neck
short
sleeves
and
low
stockings
because
she
thinks
it
pretty
she
can
feed
him
exclusively
on
raw
beef
or
on
vegetables
or
on
cereals
she
can
give
him
milk
to
drink
or
let
him
sip
his
father
beer
and
wine
put
him
to
bed
at
sundown
or
keep
him
up
till
midnight
teach
him
the
catechism
and
the
articles
or
tell
him
there
is
no
god
she
can
cram
him
with
facts
before
he
has
any
appetite
or
power
of
assimilation
or
she
can
make
a
fool
of
him
she
can
dose
him
with
remedies
with
remedies
or
she
can
let
him
die
without
remedies
because
she
does
believe
in
the
reality
of
disease
she
is
quite
willing
to
legislate
for
his
stomach
his
mind
his
soul
her
teachableness
it
goes
without
saying
being
generally
in
inverse
proportion
to
her
knowledge
for
the
arrogance
of
science
is
humility
compared
with
the
pride
of
ignorance
in
these
matters
the
child
has
no
rights
the
only
safeguard
is
the
fact
that
if
parents
are
absolutely
brutal
society
steps
in
removes
the
untrustworthy
guardian
and
appoints
another
but
society
does
nothing
can
do
nothing
with
the
parent
who
injures
the
child
soul
breaks
his
will
makes
him
grow
up
a
liar
or
a
coward
or
murders
his
faith
it
is
not
very
long
since
we
decided
that
when
a
parent
brutally
abused
his
child
it
could
be
taken
from
him
and
made
the
ward
of
the
state
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
is
of
later
date
than
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
at
a
distance
of
a
century
and
a
half
we
can
hardly
estimate
how
powerful
a
blow
rousseau
struck
for
the
rights
of
the
child
in
his
educational
romance
emile
it
was
a
sort
of
gospel
in
its
day
rousseau
once
arrested
and
exiled
his
book
burned
by
the
executioner
a
few
years
before
he
would
have
been
burned
with
it
his
ideas
naturally
became
a
craze
many
of
the
reforms
for
which
he
passionately
pleaded
are
so
much
a
part
of
our
modern
thought
that
we
do
not
realize
the
fact
that
in
those
days
of
routine
pedantry
and
slavish
worship
of
authority
they
were
the
daring
dreams
of
an
enthusiast
the
seeming
impossible
prophecy
of
a
new
era
aristocratic
mothers
were
converts
to
his
theories
and
began
nursing
their
children
as
he
commanded
them
great
lords
began
to
learn
handicrafts
physical
exercise
came
into
vogue
everything
that
emile
did
other
people
wanted
to
do
with
all
rousseau
vagaries
oddities
misconceptions
posings
he
rescued
the
individuality
of
the
child
and
made
a
tremendous
plea
for
a
more
natural
a
more
human
education
he
succeeded
in
making
people
listen
where
rabelais
and
montaigne
had
failed
and
he
inspired
other
teachers
notably
pestalozzi
and
froebel
who
knit
up
his
ragged
seams
of
theory
and
translated
his
dreams
into
possibilities
rousseau
vindicated
to
man
the
right
of
being
pestalozzi
said
grow
froebel
the
greatest
of
the
three
cried
live
you
give
bread
to
men
but
i
give
men
to
themselves
the
parent
whose
sole
answer
to
criticism
or
remonstrance
is
i
have
a
right
to
do
what
i
like
with
my
own
child
is
the
only
impossible
parent
his
moral
integument
is
too
thick
to
be
pierced
with
any
shaft
however
keen
to
him
we
can
only
say
as
jacques
did
to
orlando
god
be
with
you
let
meet
as
little
as
we
can
but
most
of
us
dare
not
take
this
ground
we
may
not
philosophize
or
formulate
we
may
not
live
up
to
our
theories
but
we
feel
in
greater
or
less
degree
the
responsibility
of
calling
a
human
being
hither
and
the
necessity
of
guarding
and
guiding
in
one
way
or
another
that
which
owes
its
being
to
us
we
should
all
agree
if
put
to
the
vote
that
a
child
has
a
right
to
be
well
born
that
was
a
trenchant
speech
of
henry
ward
beecher
on
the
subject
of
being
born
again
that
if
he
could
be
born
right
the
first
time
he
take
his
chances
on
the
second
hereditary
rank
says
washington
irving
may
be
a
snare
and
a
delusion
but
hereditary
virtue
is
a
patent
of
innate
nobility
which
far
outshines
the
blazonry
of
heraldry
over
the
unborn
our
power
is
almost
that
of
god
and
our
responsibility
like
his
toward
us
as
we
acquit
ourselves
toward
them
so
let
him
deal
with
us
why
should
we
be
astonished
at
the
warped
cold
unhappy
suspicious
natures
we
see
about
us
when
we
reflect
upon
the
number
of
unwelcomed
children
in
the
world
children
who
at
best
were
never
loved
until
they
were
seen
and
known
and
were
often
grudged
their
being
from
the
moment
they
began
to
be
i
wonder
if
sometimes
a
starved
crippled
agonized
human
body
and
soul
does
not
cry
out
why
o
man
o
woman
why
being
what
i
am
have
you
suffered
me
to
be
physiologists
and
psychologists
agree
that
the
influences
affecting
the
child
begin
before
birth
at
what
hour
they
begin
how
far
they
can
be
controlled
how
far
directed
and
modified
modern
science
is
not
assured
but
i
imagine
those
months
of
preparation
were
given
for
other
reasons
than
that
the
cradle
and
the
basket
and
the
wardrobe
might
be
ready
those
long
months
of
supreme
patience
when
the
is
growing
from
unconscious
to
conscious
being
and
when
a
host
of
mysterious
influences
and
impulses
are
being
carried
silently
from
mother
to
child
and
if
beauty
born
of
murmuring
sound
shall
pass
into
its
face
how
much
more
subtly
shall
the
grave
strength
of
peace
the
sunshine
of
hope
and
sweet
content
thrill
the
delicate
chords
of
being
and
warm
the
tender
seedling
into
richer
life
stoddard
speaks
of
that
sacred
passion
maternal
love
that
like
an
buds
and
blossoms
and
bears
at
once
when
a
true
woman
puts
her
finger
for
the
first
time
into
the
tiny
hand
of
her
baby
and
feels
that
helpless
clutch
which
tightens
her
very
she
is
born
again
with
the
child
a
mother
has
a
sacred
claim
on
the
world
even
if
that
claim
rest
solely
on
the
fact
of
her
motherhood
and
not
alas
on
any
other
her
life
may
be
a
cipher
but
when
the
child
comes
god
writes
a
figure
before
it
and
gives
it
value
once
the
child
is
born
one
of
his
inalienable
rights
which
we
too
often
deny
him
is
the
right
to
his
childhood
if
we
could
only
keep
from
untwisting
the
only
be
willing
to
let
the
sunshine
do
it
dickens
said
real
children
went
out
with
powder
and
and
yet
the
children
of
dickens
time
were
simple
buds
compared
with
the
miracles
of
conventionality
and
erudition
we
raise
nowadays
there
is
no
substitute
for
a
genuine
free
serene
healthy
childhood
a
fine
manhood
or
womanhood
can
be
built
on
no
other
foundation
and
yet
our
american
homes
are
so
often
filled
with
hurry
and
worry
our
manner
of
living
is
so
keyed
to
concert
pitch
our
plan
of
existence
so
complicated
that
we
drag
the
babies
along
in
our
wake
and
force
them
to
our
artificial
standards
forgetting
that
sweet
flowers
are
slow
and
weeds
make
haste
if
we
must
or
fancy
that
we
must
lead
this
false
too
feverish
life
let
us
at
least
spare
them
by
keeping
them
forever
on
tiptoe
we
are
in
danger
of
producing
an
army
of
conventional
little
prigs
who
know
much
more
than
they
should
about
matters
which
are
profitless
even
to
their
elders
in
the
matter
of
clothing
we
sacrifice
children
continually
to
the
moloch
of
maternal
vanity
as
if
the
demon
of
dress
did
not
demand
our
attention
sap
our
energy
and
thwart
our
activities
soon
enough
at
best
and
the
right
kind
of
children
before
they
are
spoiled
by
fine
feathers
do
detest
being
dressed
up
beyond
a
certain
point
a
tiny
maid
of
my
acquaintance
has
an
elaborate
parisian
gown
which
is
fastened
on
the
side
from
top
to
bottom
in
some
mysterious
fashion
by
a
multitude
of
tiny
buttons
and
cords
it
fits
the
dear
little
mouse
like
a
glove
and
terminates
in
a
collar
which
is
an
instrument
of
torture
to
a
person
whose
patience
has
not
been
developed
from
year
to
year
by
similar
trials
the
getting
of
it
on
is
anguish
and
as
to
the
getting
of
it
off
i
heard
her
moan
to
her
nurse
the
other
night
as
she
wriggled
her
curly
head
through
the
exit
oh
i
only
god
knows
how
i
hate
gettin
peeled
out
o
this
dress
the
spectacle
of
a
small
boy
whom
i
meet
sometimes
in
the
under
the
wing
of
his
predestinate
idiot
of
a
mother
wrings
my
very
soul
silk
hat
ruffled
shirt
shoes
kid
gloves
cane
velvet
suit
with
one
pocket
which
is
an
insult
to
his
sex
how
i
pity
the
pathetic
little
caricature
not
a
spot
has
he
to
locate
a
top
or
a
marble
or
a
nail
or
a
string
or
a
knife
or
a
cooky
or
a
nut
but
as
a
bloodless
substitute
for
these
necessities
of
existence
he
has
a
toy
watch
that
will
not
go
and
an
embroidered
handkerchief
with
cologne
on
it
as
to
keeping
children
too
clean
for
any
mortal
use
i
suppose
nothing
is
more
disastrous
the
divine
right
to
be
gloriously
dirty
a
large
portion
of
the
time
when
dirt
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
direct
useful
friendly
contact
with
all
sorts
of
interesting
helpful
things
is
too
clear
to
be
denied
the
children
who
have
to
think
of
their
clothes
before
playing
with
the
dogs
digging
in
the
sand
helping
the
stableman
working
in
the
shed
building
a
bridge
or
weeding
the
garden
never
get
half
their
legitimate
enjoyment
out
of
life
and
unhappy
fate
do
not
many
of
us
have
to
bring
up
children
without
a
vestige
of
a
dog
or
a
sand
heap
or
a
stable
or
a
shed
or
a
brook
or
a
garden
conceive
if
you
can
a
more
difficult
problem
than
giving
a
child
his
rights
in
a
city
flat
you
may
say
that
neither
do
we
get
ours
but
bad
as
we
are
we
are
always
good
enough
to
wish
for
our
children
the
joys
we
miss
ourselves
thrice
happy
is
the
country
child
or
the
one
who
can
spend
a
part
of
his
young
life
among
living
things
near
to
nature
heart
how
blessed
is
the
little
toddling
thing
who
can
lie
flat
in
the
sunshine
and
drink
in
the
beauty
of
the
green
things
growing
who
can
live
among
the
other
little
animals
his
brothers
and
sisters
in
feathers
and
fur
who
can
put
his
hand
in
that
of
dear
mother
nature
and
learn
his
first
baby
lessons
without
any
meddlesome
middleman
who
is
cradled
in
sweet
sounds
from
early
morn
to
dewy
eve
lulled
to
his
morning
nap
by
hum
of
crickets
and
bees
and
to
his
night
slumber
by
the
sighing
of
the
wind
the
plash
of
waves
or
the
ripple
of
a
river
he
is
a
part
of
the
shining
web
of
creation
learning
to
spell
out
the
universe
letter
by
letter
as
he
grows
sweetly
serenely
into
a
knowledge
of
its
laws
i
have
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
for
the
little
people
during
their
first
eight
or
ten
years
when
they
are
just
beginning
to
learn
lessons
and
when
the
laws
which
govern
them
must
often
seem
so
strange
and
unjust
it
is
not
an
occasion
for
a
big
burning
sympathy
perhaps
but
for
a
tender
little
one
with
a
half
smile
in
it
as
we
think
of
what
we
were
and
what
in
young
clothes
we
hoped
to
be
and
of
how
many
things
have
come
across
for
childhood
is
an
eternal
promise
which
no
man
ever
keeps
the
child
has
a
right
to
a
place
of
his
own
to
things
of
his
own
to
surroundings
which
have
some
relation
to
his
size
his
desires
and
his
capabilities
how
should
we
like
to
live
half
the
time
in
a
place
where
the
piano
was
twelve
feet
tall
the
door
knobs

things
in

are
so
disproportionate

the
child
stature
so
far
from
his
organs
of
prehension
so
much
above
his
horizontal
line
of
vision
so
much
ampler
than
his
immediate

that
there
is
between
him
and
all
these
big
things
a
gap
to
be
filled
only
by
a
microcosm
of
playthings
which
give
him
his

which

dressed

hardly
notices
her
let
him
see
a

in
similar
attire
he
will
be
ravished
with
ecstasy
as
if
to
show
that
it
was
the
disproportion
of
the
sizes
which
unfitted
him
to
notice
the
lady
the
larger

bigger

footnote
e
seguin
my
little
nephew
was
prowling
about
my
during
the
absence
of
his
nurse
i
was
busy
writing
and
when
he
took
up
a
delicate
pearl
i
stopped
his
investigations
with
the
no
no
dear
that
for
people
has
it
got
any
end
he
asked
wistfully
that
end
to
things
is
sometimes
just
what
we
fail
to
give
even
when
we
think
we
are
straining
every
nerve
to
surround
the
child
with
pleasures
for
children
really
want
to
do
the
very
same
things
that
we
want
to
do
and
yet
have
constantly
to
be
thwarted
for
their
own
good
they
would
like
to
share
all
our
pleasures
keep
the
same
hours
eat
the
same
food
but
they
are
met
on
every
side
with
the
seemingly
impertinent
piece
of
dogmatism
it
is
good
for
little
boys
or
it
is
nice
for
little
girls
robert
louis
stevenson
shows
in
his
child
garden
of
verses
that
he
is
one
of
the
very
few
people
who
remember
and
appreciate
this
phase
of
childhood
could
anything
be
more
deliciously
real
than
these
verses
in
winter
i
get
up
at
night
and
dress
by
yellow
candle
light
in
summer
quite
the
other
way
i
have
to
go
to
bed
by
day
i
have
to
go
to
bed
and
see
the
birds
still
hopping
on
the
tree
and
hear
the
people
feet
still
going
past
me
on
the
street
and
does
it
not
seem
hard
to
you
that
when
the
sky
is
clear
and
blue
and
i
should
like
so
much
to

hopkinson
smith
has
written
a
witty
little
monograph
on
this
relation
of
parents
and
children
i
am
glad
to
say
too
that
it
is
addressed
to
fathers
that
left
wing
of
the
family
guard
which
generally
manages
to
retreat
during
any
active
engagement
leaving
the
command
to
the
inferior
officer
this
left
wing
is
imposing
on
all
parades
but
when
there
is
any
fighting
to
be
done
it
retires
rapidly
to
the
rear
and
only
wheels
into
line
when
the
smoke
of
the
conflict
has
passed
out
of
the
atmosphere
open
your
heart
and
your
arms
wide
for
your
daughters
he
says
and
keep
them
wide
open
do
leave
all
that
to
their
mothers
an
intimacy
will
grow
with
the
years
which
will
fit
them
for
another
man
arms
and
heart
when
they
exchange
yours
for
his
make
a
chum
of
your
boy
a
comrade
get
down
to
the
level
of
his
boyhood
and
bring
him
gradually
up
to
the
level
of
your
manhood
do
look
at
him
from
the
second
story
window
of
your
fatherly
superiority
and
example
go
into
the
front
yard
and
play
ball
with
him
when
he
gets
into
scrapes
do
thrash
him
as
your
father
did
you
put
your
arm
around
his
neck
and
say
you
know
it
is
pretty
bad
but
that
he
can
count
on
you
to
help
him
out
and
that
you
will
every
single
time
and
that
if
he
had
let
you
know
earlier
it
would
have
been
all
the
easier
again
the
child
has
a
right
to
more
justice
in
his
discipline
than
we
are
generally
wise
and
patient
enough
to
give
him
he
is
by
and
by
to
come
in
contact
with
a
world
where
cause
and
effect
follow
each
other
inexorably
he
has
a
right
to
be
taught
and
to
be
governed
by
the
laws
under
which
he
must
afterwards
live
but
in
too
many
cases
parents
interfere
so
mischievously
and
unnecessarily
between
causes
and
effects
that
the
child
mind
does
not
can
not
perceive
the
logic
of
things
as
it
should
we
might
write
a
pathetic
remonstrance
against
the
decline
and
fall
of
domestic
authority
there
is
food
for
thought
and
perhaps
for
fear
in
the
subject
but
the
facts
are
obvious
and
their
inevitableness
must
strike
any
thoughtful
observer
of
the
times
the
old
educational
regime
was
akin
to
the
social
systems
with
which
it
was
contemporaneous
and
similarly
in
the
reverse
of
these
characteristics
our
modern
modes
of
culture
correspond
to
our
more
liberal
religious
and
political
institutions
it
is
the
age
of
independent
criticism
the
child
problem
is
merely
one
phase
of
the
universal
problem
that
confronts
society
it
seems
likely
that
the
rod
of
reason
will
have
to
replace
the
rod
of
birch
parental
authority
never
used
to
be
called
into
question
neither
was
the
catechism
nor
the
bible
nor
the
minister
how
should
parents
hope
to
escape
the
universal
interrogation
point
leveled
at
everything
else
in
these
days
of
free
speech
it
is
hopeless
to
suppose
that
even
infants
can
be
muzzled
we
revel
in
our
republican
virtues
let
us
accept
the
vices
of
those
virtues
as
philosophically
as
possible
a
lady
has
been
advertising
in
a
new
york
paper
for
a
german
governess
to
mind
a
little
girl
three
years
old
the
lady
english
is
doubtless
defective
but
the
fate
of
the
governess
is
thereby
indicated
with
much
greater
candor
than
is
usual
the
mother
who
is
most
apt
to
infringe
on
the
rights
of
her
child
of
course
with
the
best
intentions
is
the
firm
person
afflicted
with
the
lust
of
dominion
there
is
no
elasticity
in
her
firmness
to
prevent
it
from
degenerating
into
obstinacy
it
is
not
the
firmness
of
the
tree
that
bends
without
breaking
but
the
firmness
of
a
certain
animal
whose
force
of
character
has
impressed
itself
on
the
common
mind
and
become
proverbial
jean
paul
says
if
trop
is
the
best
rule
in
politics
it
is
equally
true
of
discipline
but
if
the
child
is
unhappy
who
has
none
of
his
rights
respected
equally
wretched
is
the
little
despot
who
has
more
than
his
own
rights
who
has
never
been
taught
to
respect
the
rights
of
others
and
whose
only
conception
of
the
universe
is
that
of
an
absolute
monarchy
in
which
he
is
sole
ruler
children
rarely
love
those
who
spoil
them
and
never
trust
them
their
keen
young
sense
detects
the
false
note
in
the
character
and
draws
its
own
conclusions
which
are
generally
very
just
the
very
best
theoretical
statement
of
a
wise
disciplinary
method
that
i
know
is
herbert
spencer
let
the
history
of
your
domestic
rule
typify
in
little
the
history
of
our
political
rule
at
the
outset
autocratic
control
where
control
is
really
needful
by
and
by
an
incipient
constitutionalism
in
which
the
liberty
of
the
subject
gains
some
express
recognition
successive
extensions
of
this
liberty
of
the
subject
gradually
ending
in
parental
abdication
we
must
not
expect
children
to
be
too
good
not
any
better
than
we
ourselves
for
example
no
nor
even
as
good
beware
of
hothouse
virtue
already
most
people
recognize
the
detrimental
results
of
intellectual
precocity
but
there
remains
to
be
recognized
the
truth
that
there
is
a
moral
precocity
which
is
also
detrimental
our
higher
moral
faculties
like
our
higher
intellectual
ones
are
comparatively
complex
by
consequence
they
are
both
comparatively
late
in
their
evolution
and
with
the
one
as
with
the
other
a
very
early
activity
produced
by
stimulation
will
be
at
the
expense
of
the
future
character
in
these
matters
the
child
has
a
right
to
expect
examples
he
lives
in
the
senses
he
can
only
learn
through
object
lessons
can
only
pass
from
the
concrete
example
of
goodness
to
a
vision
of
abstract
perfection
wayward
childhood
wouldst
thou
hold
firm
rule
and
sun
thee
in
the
light
of
happy
faces
love
hope
and
patience
these
must
be
thy
graces
and
in
thine
own
heart
let
them
first
keep
school
yes
in
thine
own
heart
let
them
first
keep
school
i
can
not
see
why
max
should
have
exclaimed
with
such
unction
that
if
he
were
to
be
born
over
again
he
would
choose
to
be
an
american
woman
he
has
never
tried
being
one
he
does
not
realize
that
she
not
only
has
in
hand
the
emancipation
of
the
american
woman
but
the
reformation
of
the
american
man
and
the
education
of
the
american
child
if
that
triangular
mission
in
life
does
not
keep
her
out
of
mischief
and
make
her
the
angel
of
the
twentieth
century
she
is
a
hopeless
case
spencer
says
it
is
a
truth
yet
remaining
to
be
recognized
that
the
last
stage
in
the
mental
development
of
each
man
and
woman
is
to
be
reached
only
through
the
proper
discharge
of
the
parental
duties
and
when
this
truth
is
recognized
it
will
be
seen
how
admirable
is
the
ordination
in
virtue
of
which
human
beings
are
led
by
their
strongest
affections
to
subject
themselves
to
a
discipline
which
they
would
else
elude
women
have
been
fighting
many
battles
for
the
higher
education
these
last
few
years
and
they
have
nearly
gained
the
day
when
at
last
complete
victory
shall
perch
upon
their
banners
let
them
make
one
more
struggle
and
that
for
the
highest
education
which
shall
include
a
specific
training
for
parenthood
a
subject
thus
far
quite
omitted
from
the
curriculum
the
mistaken
idea
that
instinct
is
a
sufficient
guide
in
so
delicate
and
sacred
and
vital
a
matter
the
comfortable
superstition
that
babies
bring
their
own
directions
with
them
these
fictions
have
existed
long
enough
if
a
girl
asks
me
why
since
the
function
of
parenthood
is
so
uncertain
she
should
make
the
sacrifices
necessary
to
such
training
sacrifices
entailed
by
this
highest
education
of
body
mind
and
spirit
i
can
only
say
that
it
is
better
to
be
ready
even
if
one
is
not
called
for
than
to
be
called
for
and
found
wanting
children
plays
the
plays
of
the
age
are
the
of
the
whole
future
life
for
the
whole
man
is
visible
in
them
in
his
finest
capacities
and
his
innermost
being
newell
in
his
admirable
book
on
children
games
traces
to
their
proper
source
all
the
familiar
plays
which
in
one
form
or
another
have
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
and
are
still
played
wherever
and
whenever
children
come
together
in
any
numbers
the
result
of
his
sympathetic
and
scholarly
investigations
is
most
interesting
to
the
student
of
childhood
and
as
valuable
philologically
as
historically
in
speaking
of
the
old
rounds
and
rhymed
formulas
which
have
preserved
their
vitality
under
the
effacing
hand
of
time
he
says
it
will
be
obvious
that
many
of
these
were
not
composed
by
children
they
were
formerly
played
as
in
many
countries
they
are
still
played
by
young
persons
of
marriageable
age
or
even
by
mature
men
and
women
the
truth
is
that
in
past
centuries
all
the
world
judged
by
our
present
standard
seems
to
have
been
a
little
childish
the
maids
of
honor
of
queen
elizabeth
day
if
we
may
credit
the
poets
were
devoted
to
the
game
of
tag
with
which
even
diana
and
her
nymphs
were
supposed
to
amuse
themselves
we
need
not
however
go
to
remote
times
or
lands
for
illustration
which
is
supplied
by
new
england
country
towns
of
a
generation
ago
dancing
under
that
name
was
little
practiced
the
amusement
of
young
people
at
their
gatherings
was
playing
games
these
games
generally
resulted
in
forfeits
to
be
redeemed
by
kissing
in
every
possible
variety
of
position
and
method
many
of
these
games
were
rounds
but
as
they
were
not
called
dances
and
as
pays
more
attention
to
words
than
things
the
religious
conscience
of
the
community
which
objected
to
dancing
took
no
alarm
such
were
the
pleasures
of
young
men
and
women
from
sixteen
to
years
of
age
nor
were
the
participants
mere
rustics
many
of
them
could
boast
as
good
blood
as
careful
breeding
and
as
much
intelligence
as
any
in
the
land
neither
was
the
morality
or
sensitiveness
of
the
young
women
of
that
day
in
any
respect
inferior
to
what
it
is
at
present
now
that
our
country
towns
are
become
mere
outlying
suburbs
of
cities
these
remarks
may
be
read
with
a
smile
at
the
rude
simplicity
of
american
life
but
the
laugh
should
be
directed
not
at
our
own
country
but
at
the
bygone
age
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
mediaeval
europe
and
in
england
till
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
a
kiss
was
the
usual
salutation
of
a
lady
to
a
gentleman
whom
she
wished
to
honor
the
portuguese
ladies
who
came
to
england
with
the
infanta
in
were
not
used
to
the
custom
but
as
pepys
says
in
ten
days
they
had
to
kiss
and
look
freely
up
and
down
kissing
in
games
was
therefore
a
matter
of
course
in
all
ranks
in
respectable
and
cultivated
french
society
at
the
time
of
which
we
speak
the
amusements
not
merely
of
young
people
but
of
their
elders
as
well
were
every
whit
as
crude
madame
celnart
a
recognized
authority
on
etiquette
compiled
in
a
very
curious
complete
manual
of
society
games
recommending
them
as
recreation
for
varying
movement
she
says
diversity
the
gracious
and
gay
ideas
which
these
games
inspire
the
decorous
caresses
which
they
permit
all
this
combines
to
give
real
amusement
these
caresses
can
alarm
neither
modesty
nor
prudence
since
a
kiss
in
honor
given
and
taken
before
numerous
witnesses
is
often
an
act
of
propriety
the
old
ballads
and
nursery
rhymes
doubtless
had
much
of
innocence
and
freshness
in
them
but
they
only
come
to
us
nowadays
tainted
by
the
odors
of
city
streets
the
pleasure
and
poetry
of
the
original
essence
are
gone
and
vulgarity
reigns
triumphant
if
you
listen
to
the
words
of
the
games
which
children
play
in
school
yards
on
sidewalks
and
in
the
streets
on
pleasant
evenings
you
will
find
that
most
of
them
to
say
the
least
border
closely
on
vulgarity
that
they
are
utterly
unsuitable
to
childhood
notwithstanding
that
they
are
played
with
great
glee
that
they
are
in
fine
common
rude
silly
and
boorish
one
can
never
watch
a
circle
of
children
going
through
the
vulgar
inanities
of
jenny
say
daughter
will
you
get
up
green
gravel
or
here
come
two
ducks
without
unspeakable
shrinking
and
moral
disgust
these
plays
are
dying
out
let
them
die
for
there
is
a
hint
of
happier
things
abroad
in
the
air
the
wisest
mind
of
wise
antiquity
told
the
riddle
of
the
sphinx
if
having
ears
to
hear
we
would
hear
our
youth
should
be
educated
in
a
stricter
rule
from
the
first
for
if
education
becomes
lawless
and
the
youths
themselves
become
lawless
they
can
never
grow
up
into
or
meritorious
citizens
and
education
must
begin
with
their
we
talk
a
great
deal
about
the
strength
of
early
impressions
i
wonder
if
we
mean
all
we
say
we
do
not
live
up
to
it
at
all
events
in
childish
play
deep
meaning
lies
the
hand
that
rocks
the
cradle
is
the
hand
that
rules
the
world
give
me
the
first
six
years
of
a
child
life
and
i
care
not
who
has
the
rest
the
child
of
six
years
has
learned
already
far
more
than
a
student
learns
in
his
entire
university
course
the
first
six
years
are
as
full
of
advancement
as
the
six
days
of
creation
and
so
on
if
we
did
believe
these
things
fully
we
should
begin
education
with
conscious
intelligence
at
the
cradle
if
not
earlier
the
great
german
dramatic
critic
schlegel
once
sneered
at
the
brothers
jacob
and
william
grimm
for
what
he
styled
their
meditation
on
the
insignificant
these
two
brothers
says
a
wiser
student
an
historian
of
german
literature
were
animated
by
a
pathetic
optimism
and
possessed
that
sober
imagination
which
delights
in
small
things
and
narrow
interests
lingering
over
them
with
strong
affection
they
explored
villages
and
hamlets
for
obscure
legends
and
folk
tales
for
nursery
songs
even
and
bringing
to
bear
on
such
things
at
once
a
human
affection
and
a
wise
scholarship
their
meditation
on
the
insignificant
became
the
basis
of
their
scientific
greatness
and
the
source
of
their
popularity
every
child
has
read
some
of
grimm
household
tales
the
frog
prince
hans
in
luck
or
the
two
brothers
but
comparatively
few
people
realize
perhaps
that
this
collection
of
stories
is
the
foundation
of
the
modern
science
of
and
a
in
researches
of
philology
and
history
which
place
the
name
of
grimm
among
the
benefactors
of
our
race
i
refer
to
these
brothers
because
they
expressed
one
of
the
leading
theories
of
the
new
education
my
principle
said
jacob
grimm
has
been
to
undervalue
nothing
but
to
utilize
the
small
for
the
illustration
of
the
great
when
friedrich
froebel
the
founder
of
the
kindergarten
in
the
course
of
his
researches
began
to
watch
the
plays
of
children
and
to
study
their
unconscious
actions
his
meditation
on
the
insignificant
became
the
basis
of
scientific
greatness
and
of
an
influence
still
in
its
infancy
but
destined
perhaps
to
revolutionize
the
whole
educational
method
of
society
it
was
while
he
was
looking
on
with
delight
at
the
plays
of
little
children
their
happy
busy
plans
and
their
intense
interest
in
outward
nature
and
in
putting
things
together
or
taking
them
apart
that
froebel
said
to
himself
what
if
we
could
give
the
child
that
which
is
called
education
through
his
voluntary
activities
and
have
him
always
as
eager
as
he
is
at
play
how
well
i
remember
years
ago
the
first
time
i
ever
joined
in
a
kindergarten
game
i
was
beckoned
to
the
charming
circle
and
not
only
one
but
a
dozen
openings
were
made
for
me
and
immediately
though
i
was
a
stranger
a
little
hand
on
either
side
was
put
into
mine
with
such
friendly
trusting
pressure
that
i
felt
quite
at
home
then
we
began
to
sing
of
the
and
i
found
myself
a
green
tree
waving
its
branches
in
the
wind
i
was
frightened
and
but
i
did
it
and
nobody
seemed
to
notice
me
then
i
was
a
flower
opening
its
petals
in
the
sunshine
and
presently
a
swallow
gathering
straws
for
then
carried
away
by
the
spirit
of
the
kindergartner
and
her
children
i
fluttered
my
clumsy
apologies
for
wings
and
forgetting
self
flew
about
with
all
the
others
as
happy
as
a
bird
soon
i
found
that
i
the
stranger
had
been
chosen
for
the
mother
swallow
it
was
to
me
the
girl
of
eighteen
like
mounting
a
throne
and
being
crowned
four
cunning
curly
heads
cuddled
under
my
wings
for
protection
and
slumber
and
i
saw
that
i
was
expected
to
stoop
and
brood
them
which
i
did
with
a
feeling
of
tenderness
and
responsibility
that
i
had
never
experienced
in
my
life
before
then
when
i
followed
my
baby
swallows
back
to
their
seats
i
saw
that
the
play
had
broken
down
every
barrier
between
us
and
that
they
clustered
about
me
as
confidingly
as
if
we
were
old
friends
i
think
i
never
before
felt
my
own
limitations
so
keenly
or
desired
so
strongly
to
be
fully
worthy
of
a
child
trust
and
love
kindergarten
play
takes
the
children
where
they
love
to
be
into
the
world
of
in
this
lovely
world
the
children
are
blacksmiths
carpenters
wheelwrights
birds
bees
butterflies
trees
flowers
sunbeams
rainbows
frogs
lambs
ponies
anything
they
like
the
play
is
so
characteristic
so
poetic
so
profoundly
touching
in
its
simplicity
and
purity
so
full
of
meaning
that
it
would
inspire
us
with
admiration
and
respect
were
it
the
only
salient
point
of
froebel
educational
idea
it
endeavors
to
express
the
same
idea
in
poetic
words
harmonious
melody
and
fitting
motion
appealing
thus
to
the
thought
feeling
and
activity
of
the
child
physical
impressions
are
at
the
beginning
of
life
the
only
possible
medium
for
awakening
the
child
sensibility
these
impressions
should
therefore
be
regulated
as
systematically
as
possible
and
not
left
to
chance
froebel
supplies
the
means
for
bringing
about
the
result
in
a
simple
system
of
symbolic
songs
and
games
appealing
to
the
activities
and
sensibilities
these
he
argues
ought
to
contain
the
germ
of
all
later
instruction
and
thought
for
physical
and
sensuous
perceptions
are
the
points
of
departure
of
all
knowledge
when
the
child
imitates
he
begins
to
understand
let
him
imitate
the
airy
flight
of
the
bird
and
he
enters
partially
into
bird
life
let
the
little
girl
personate
the
hen
with
her
feathery
brood
of
chickens
and
her
own
maternal
instinct
is
quickened
as
she
guards
and
guides
the
wayward
motion
of
the
little
flock
let
the
child
play
the
carpenter
the
wheelwright
the
the
farmer
and
his
intelligence
is
immediately
awakened
he
will
see
the
force
the
meaning
the
power
and
the
need
of
labor
in
short
let
him
mirror
in
his
play
all
the
different
aspects
of
universal
life
and
his
thought
will
begin
to
grasp
their
significance
thus
kindergarten
play
may
be
defined
as
a
systematized
sequence
of
experiences
through
which
the
child
grows
into
clear
observation
and
conscious
perception
of
the
whole
circle
of
relationships
and
the
symbols
of
his
play
become
at
length
the
truth
itself
bound
fast
and
deep
in
heart
knowledge
which
is
deeper
and
rarer
than
head
knowledge
after
all
to
the
class
occupied
exclusively
with
material
things
this
phase
of
froebel
idea
may
perhaps
seem
mystical
there
is
nothing
mystical
to
children
however
all
is
real
for
their
visions
have
not
been
dispelled
turn
i
may
by
night
or
day
the
things
which
i
have
seen
i
now
can
see
no
more
as
soon
as
the
child
begins
to
be
conscious
of
his
own
activities
and
his
power
of
regulating
them
he
desires
to
imitate
the
actions
of
his
future
life
nothing
so
delights
the
little
girl
as
to
play
at
housekeeping
in
her
tiny
mansion
sacred
to
the
use
of
dolls
see
her
whimsical
attention
to
dust
and
dirt
her
tremendous
wisdom
in
dispensing
the
work
and
ordering
the
duties
of
the
household
her
careful
attention
to
the
morals
and
manners
of
her
the
boy
too
tries
to
share
in
the
life
of
a
man
to
play
at
his
father
work
to
be
a
miniature
carpenter
salesman
or
what
not
he
rides
his
father
cane
and
calls
it
a
horse
in
the
same
way
that
the
little
girl
wraps
a
shawl
about
a
towel
and
showers
upon
it
the
tenderest
tokens
of
maternal
affection
all
these
examples
go
to
show
that
every
conscious
intellectual
phase
of
the
mind
has
a
previous
phase
in
which
it
was
unconscious
or
merely
symbolic
to
get
at
the
spirit
and
inspiration
of
symbolic
representation
in
song
and
game
it
is
necessary
first
of
all
to
study
froebel
mutter
und
perhaps
the
most
strikingly
original
instructive
serviceable
book
in
the
whole
history
of
the
practice
of
education
the
significant
remark
quoted
in
froebel
reminiscences
is
this
he
who
understands
what
i
mean
by
these
songs
knows
my
inmost
secret
you
will
find
people
who
say
the
music
in
the
book
is
poor
which
is
largely
true
and
that
the
versification
is
weak
which
is
often
not
always
true
and
is
sometimes
to
be
attributed
to
faulty
translation
but
the
idea
the
spirit
the
continuity
of
the
plan
are
matchless
and
critics
who
call
it
trifling
or
silly
are
those
who
have
not
the
seeing
eye
nor
the
understanding
heart
froebel
wife
said
of
it
a
superficial
mind
does
not
grasp
it
a
gentle
mind
does
not
hate
it
a
coarse
mind
makes
fun
of
it
a
thoughtful
mind
alone
tries
to
get
at
it
froebel
considers
it
his
duty
to
picture
the
home
as
it
ought
to
be
not
by
writing
a
book
of
theories
and
of
rules
which
are
easily
forgotten
but
by
accompanying
a
mother
in
her
daily
rounds
through
house
garden
and
field
and
by
following
her
to
workshop
market
and
church
he
does
not
represent
a
woman
of
fashion
but
prefers
one
of
humbler
station
whom
he
clothes
in
the
old
german
housewife
style
it
may
be
a
small
sphere
she
occupies
but
there
she
is
the
centre
and
she
completely
fills
her
place
she
rejoices
in
the
dignity
of
her
position
as
educator
of
a
human
being
whom
she
has
to
bring
into
harmony
with
god
nature
and
man
she
thinks
nothing
too
trifling
that
concerns
her
child
she
watches
clothes
feeds
and
trains
it
in
good
habits
and
when
her
darling
is
asleep
her
prayers
finish
the
day
she
may
not
have
read
much
about
education
but
her
sympathy
with
the
child
suggests
means
of
doing
her
duty
love
has
made
her
inventive
she
discovers
means
of
amusement
for
play
she
talks
and
sings
sometimes
in
poetry
and
sometimes
in
prose
from
mothers
in
his
circle
of
relations
and
friends
froebel
has
learned
what
a
mother
can
do
and
although
he
had
no
children
of
his
own
his
heart
vibrated
instinctively
with
the
feelings
of
a
mother
joy
hope
and
fear
he
did
not
care
about
the
scorn
of
others
when
he
felt
he
must
speak
with
an
almost
womanly
heart
to
a
mother
his
own
loss
of
a
tender
care
made
him
the
more
appreciate
the
importance
of
a
love
in
early
infancy
the
mother
in
his
book
makes
use
of
all
the
impressions
influences
and
agencies
with
which
the
child
comes
in
contact
she
protects
from
evil
she
stimulates
for
good
she
places
the
child
in
direct
communication
with
nature
because
she
herself
admires
its
beauties
she
has
a
right
feeling
towards
her
neighbors
and
to
all
those
on
whom
she
depends
a
movement
of
arms
and
feet
teaches
her
that
the
child
feels
its
strength
and
wants
to
use
it
she
helps
she
lifts
she
teaches
and
while
playing
with
her
baby
hands
and
feet
she
is
never
at
a
loss
for
a
song

destroys

its
fun

merriment
we
can
not
tell
how
early
the
pleasing
sense
of
musical
cadence
affects
a
child
in
some
children
it
is
blended
with
the
earliest
haziest
recollection
of
life
at
all
as
though
they
had
been
literally
in
sweet
song
and
we
may
be
sure
that
the
hearing
of
musical
sounds
and
singing
in
association
with
others
are
for
the
child
as
for
the
adult
powerful
influences
in
awakening
sympathetic
emotion
and
pleasure
in
associated
action
who
can
see
the
kindergarten
games
led
by
a
teacher
who
has
grown
into
their
spirit
and
ever
forget
the
joy
of
the
spectacle
it
brings
tears
to
the
eyes
of
any
woman
who
has
ever
been
called
mother
or
ever
hopes
to
be
and
i
have
seen
more
than
one
man
retire
surreptitiously
to
wipe
away
his
tears
is
it
that
touch
of
nature
which
makes
the
whole
world
kin
is
it
the
perfect
of
the
children
is
it
a
touch
of
that
the
radiant
visions
of
our
childhood
days
have
been
dispelled
and
the
years
have
brought
the
inevitable
yoke
or
is
it
the
touching
sight
of
so
much
happiness
contrasted
with
what
we
know
the
home
life
to
be
sydney
smith
says
if
you
make
children
happy
now
you
will
make
them
happy
twenty
years
hence
by
the
memory
of
it
and
we
know
that
virtue
kindles
at
the
touch
of
this
joy
selfishness
rudeness
and
similar
weedy
growths
of
or
of
can
not
grow
in
such
an
atmosphere
for
joy
is
as
foreign
to
tumult
and
destruction
to
harshness
and
selfish
disregard
of
others
as
the
serene
vernal
sky
with
its
refreshing
breezes
is
foreign
to
the
uproar
and
terrors
of
the
hurricane
for
this
kind
of
ideal
play
we
are
indebted
to
friedrich
froebel
and
if
he
had
left
no
other
legacy
to
childhood
we
should
exalt
him
for
it
if
you
are
skeptical
let
me
beseech
you
to
join
the
children
in
a
free
kindergarten
and
play
with
them
you
will
be
convinced
not
through
your
head
perhaps
but
through
your
heart
i
remember
converting
such
a
grim
female
once
you
know
henry
james
says
some
women
are
unmarried
by
choice
and
others
by
chance
but
olive
chancellor
was
unmarried
by
every
implication
of
her
being
now
this
predestinate
spinster
acquaintance
of
mine
well
nigh
spoiled
by
years
of
in
the
wrong
spirit
was
determined
to
think
kindergarten
play
simply
a
piece
of
nauseating
frivolity
she
tried
her
best
but
kept
in
the
circle
with
the
children
five
successive
days
she
relaxed
so
completely
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
she
kept
herself
from
being
a
butterfly
or
a
bird
it
is
always
so
no
one
can
resist
the
unconscious
happiness
of
children
as
for
the
good
that
comes
to
grown
people
from
playing
with
children
in
this
joyous
freedom
and
with
this
deep
earnestness
of
purpose
it
is
beyond
all
imagination
if
i
had
a
daughter
who
was
frivolous
or
worldly
or
selfish
or
cold
or
unthoughtful
who
regarded
life
as
a
pleasantry
or
fell
into
the
still
more
stupid
mistake
of
thinking
it
not
worth
living
i
should
not
at
first
make
her
read
the
bible
or
teach
in
the
or
call
on
the
minister
or
request
the
prayers
of
the
congregation
but
i
should
put
her
in
a
good
kindergarten
training
school
no
normal
young
woman
can
resist
the
influence
of
the
study
of
childhood
and
the
daily
life
among
little
children
especially
the
children
of
the
poor
it
is
irresistible
oh
these
tiny
teachers
if
we
only
learned
from
them
all
we
might
instead
of
feeling
ourselves
i
never
look
down
into
the
still
clear
pool
of
a
child
innocent
questioning
eyes
without
thinking
dear
little
one
it
must
be
and
take
between
thee
and
me
i
have
gained
something
here
in
all
these
years
but
thou
hast
come
from
thence
more
lately
than
have
i
thou
hast
a
treasure
that
the
years
have
stolen
from
me
share
it
with
me
let
us
endeavor
then
to
make
the
child
life
objective
to
him
let
us
unlock
to
him
the
significance
of
family
social
and
national
relationships
so
that
he
may
grow
into
sympathy
with
them
he
loves
the
symbol
which
interprets
his
nature
to
himself
and
in
his
eager
play
he
pictures
the
life
he
longs
to
understand
if
we
could
make
such
education
continuous
if
we
could
surround
the
child
in
his
earlier
years
with
such
an
atmosphere
of
goodness
beauty
and
wisdom
none
can
doubt
that
he
would
unconsciously
grow
into
harmony
and
union
with
the
the
and
the
children
playthings
books
can
not
teach
what
toys
inculcate
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
discussed
froebel
plays
and
found
that
the
playful
spirit
which
pervades
all
the
kindergarten
exercises
must
not
be
regarded
as
trivial
since
it
has
a
philosophic
motive
and
a
definite
earnest
purpose
we
discussed
the
meaning
of
childish
play
and
deplored
the
lack
of
good
and
worthy
national
nursery
plays
passing
then
to
we
found
that
the
very
heart
of
his
educational
idea
lies
in
the
book
and
that
it
serves
as
a
guide
for
mothers
whose
babies
are
yet
in
their
arms
as
well
as
for
those
who
have
little
children
of
four
or
five
years
under
their
care
we
found
that
in
froebel
plays
the
mirror
is
held
up
to
universal
life
that
the
child
in
playing
them
grows
into
unconscious
sympathy
with
the
natural
the
human
the
divine
that
by
playing
at
the
life
he
longs
to
understand
he
grows
at
last
into
a
conscious
realization
of
its
mysteries
its
truth
its
meaning
its
dignity
its
purpose
we
found
that
symbolic
play
leads
the
child
from
the
symbol
to
the
truth
symbolized
we
discovered
that
the
carefully
chosen
words
of
the
kindergarten
songs
and
games
suggest
thought
to
the
child
the
thought
suggests
gesture
the
melody
begets
spiritual
feeling
we
discussed
the
relation
of
body
and
mind
the
effect
of
bodily
attitudes
on
feeling
and
thought
as
well
as
the
moulding
of
the
body
by
the
indwelling
mind
froebel
playthings
are
as
significant
as
his
plays
if
you
examine
the
materials
he
offers
children
in
his
gifts
and
occupations
you
can
not
help
seeing
that
they
meet
the
child
natural
wants
in
a
truly
wonderful
manner
and
that
used
in
connection
with
conversations
and
stories
and
games
they
address
and
develop
his
love
of
movement
and
his
love
of
rhythm
his
desire
to
touch
and
handle
to
play
and
work
to
be
busy
and
his
curiosity
to
know
his
instincts
of
construction
and
comparison
his
fondness
for
gardening
and
digging
in
the
earth
his
social
impulse
and
finally
his
religious
feeling
froebel
himself
says
if
his
educational
materials
are
found
useful
it
can
not
be
because
of
their
exterior
which
is
as
simple
as
possible
and
contains
nothing
new
but
their
worth
is
to
be
found
exclusively
in
their
application
if
you
can
work
out
his
principles
or
better
ones
still
when
we
find
better
ones
by
other
means
pray
do
it
if
you
prefer
since
the
object
of
the
kindergartner
is
not
to
make
froebel
an
but
an
he
seems
to
have
found
admirable
for
awaking
the
higher
senses
of
the
child
and
unlike
the
usual
scheme
of
object
lessons
they
tell
a
continued
story
when
the
first
burst
upon
the
enraptured
sight
of
the
teacher
this
list
of
subjects
appeared
in
a
printed
catalogue
showing
the
ground
of
study
in
a
certain
school
for
six
months
spiders
apple
hippopotamus
cow
cotton
duck
sugar
rabbits
rice
lighthouse
candle
pins
tiger
clothing
silver
giraffe
onion
such
reckless
heterogeneity
as
this
is
impossible
with
educational
materials
for
even
if
they
are
given
to
the
child
without
a
single
word
they
carry
something
of
their
own
logic
with
them
they
emphasize
the
gospel
of
doing
for
froebel
believes
in
positives
in
teaching
not
negatives
in
stimulants
not
deterrents
how
inexpressibly
tiresome
is
the
everlasting
do
in
some
households
do
get
in
the
fire
do
play
in
the
water
do
tease
the
kitty
do
trouble
the
doggy
do
bother
the
lady
do
interrupt
contradict
do
fidget
with
your
brother
and
worry
me
now
while
perhaps
in
this
whole
tirade
not
a
word
has
been
said
of
something
to
do
let
sleeping
faults
lie
as
long
as
possible
while
we
quietly
oust
them
little
by
little
by
developing
the
good
qualities
surely
the
less
we
use
deterrents
the
better
since
they
are
often
the
first
introduction
to
what
is
undesirable
or
wrong
i
am
quite
sure
they
have
something
of
that
effect
on
grown
people
the
telling
us
not
to
do
and
that
we
can
not
must
not
do
a
certain
thing
surrounds
it
with
a
momentary
fascination
if
your
enemy
suggests
that
there
is
a
pot
of
paris
green
on
the
piazza
but
you
must
not
take
a
spoonful
and
dissolve
it
in
a
cup
of
honey
and
give
it
to
your
maiden
aunt
who
has
made
her
will
in
your
favor
your
innocent
mind
hovers
for
an
instant
over
the
murderous
idea
froebel
come
to
the
child
when
he
has
entered
upon
the
of
getting
something
to
do
if
legitimate
means
fail
then
let
the
portcullis
fall
the
child
must
be
busy
the
fly
on
the
will
be
crushed
the
kettle
tied
to
the
dog
tail
the
curtains
cut
into
snips
the
baby
hair
shingled
anything
that
his
untiring
hands
may
not
pause
an
instant
anything
that
his
chubby
legs
may
take
his
restless
body
over
a
circuit
of
a
hundred
miles
or
so
before
he
is
immured
in
his
crib
for
the
night
the
child
of
four
or
five
years
is
still
interested
in
objects
in
the
concrete
he
wants
to
see
and
to
hear
to
examine
and
to
work
with
his
hands
how
absurd
then
for
us
to
make
him
fold
his
arms
and
keep
his
active
fingers
still
or
strive
to
stupefy
him
with
such
an
opiate
as
the
alphabet
if
we
can
possess
our
souls
and
primers
in
patience
for
a
while
and
feed
his
senses
if
we
will
let
him
take
in
living
facts
and
await
the
result
that
result
will
be
that
when
he
has
learned
to
perceive
compare
and
construct
he
will
desire
to
learn
words
for
they
tell
him
what
others
have
seen
thought
and
done
this
reading
and
writing
what
is
it
after
all
but
the
signs
for
things
and
thoughts
logically
we
must
first
know
things
then
thoughts
then
their
records
the
law
of
human
progress
is
from
physical
activity
to
mental
power
from
a
hercules
to
a
shakespeare
and
it
is
as
true
for
each
unit
of
humanity
as
it
is
for
the
race
everything
in
froebel
playthings
trains
the
child
to
quick
accurate
observation
they
help
children
to
a
fuller
vision
they
lead
them
to
see
did
you
ever
think
how
many
people
there
are
who
having
eyes
see
not
ruskin
says
hundreds
of
people
can
talk
for
one
who
can
think
but
thousands
can
think
for
one
who
can
see
to
see
clearly
is
poetry
prophecy
religion
all
in
one
a
gentleman
who
is
trying
to
write
the
biography
of
a
great
man
complained
to
me
lately
that
in
consulting
a
dozen
of
his
friends
men
and
women
who
had
known
him
as
preacher
orator
reformer
and
poet
so
few
of
them
had
anything
characteristic
and
fine
to
relate
what
he
said
is
the
use
of
trying
to
write
biography
with
such
mummies
for
witnesses
they
would
have
seen
just
as
much
if
they
had
had
nothing
but
glass
eyes
in
their
heads
what
is
education
good
for
that
does
not
teach
the
mind
to
observe
accurately
and
define
picturesquely
to
get
at
the
essence
of
an
object
and
clear
away
the
accompanying
rubbish
this
is
the
only
training
that
fits
men
and
women
to
live
with
any
profit
to
themselves
or
pleasure
to
others
what
a
biographer
for
example
or
at
least
what
a
witness
for
some
other
biographer
was
latent
in
the
little
boy
who
when
told
by
his
teacher
to
define
a
bat
said
he
a
nasty
little
mouse
with
wings
and
tail
and
bites
like
the
devil
there
was
an
eye
worth
having
agassiz
himself
could
not
have
hit
off
better
the
salient
characteristics
of
the
little
creature
in
question
had
that
remarkable
boy
been
brought
into
contact
for
five
minutes
only
with
julius
caesar
who
can
doubt
that
the
telling
description
he
would
have
given
of
him
would
have
come
down
through
all
the
ages
i
do
not
mean
to
urge
the
adoption
of
any
standpoint
in
regard
to
playthings
or
advise
you
rudely
to
enter
the
realm
of
early
infancy
and
interfere
with
the
baby
legitimate
desires
by
any
meddlesome
pedagogic
reasoning
choose
his
toys
wisely
and
then
leave
him
alone
with
them
leave
him
to
the
throng
of
emotional
impressions
they
will
call
into
being
remember
that
they
speak
to
his
feelings
when
his
mind
is
not
yet
open
to
reason
the
toy
at
this
period
is
surrounded
with
a
halo
of
poetry
and
mystery
and
lays
hold
of
the
imagination
and
the
heart
without
awaking
vulgar
curiosity
thrice
happy
age
when
one
can
hug
one
white
woolly
lamb
to
one
bibbed
breast
kiss
its
pink
bead
eyes
in
irrational
ecstasy
and
manipulate
the
squeak
in
its
foreground
without
desire
to
explore
the
cause
thereof
at
this
period
the
toy
the
dumb
sharer
of
the
joys
and
sorrows
becomes
the
nucleus
of
a
thousand
enterprises
each
rendered
more
fascinating
by
its
presence
and
sympathy
if
the
toy
be
a
horse
they
take
imaginary
journeys
together
and
the
road
is
doubly
delightful
because
never
traveled
alone
if
it
be
a
house
the
child
lives
therein
a
different
life
for
every
day
in
the
week
for
no
monarch
alive
is
so
as
he
whose
throne
is
the
imagination
little
tin
soldier
shem
ham
and
japhet
from
the
ark
the
hornless
cow
the
tailless
dog
and
the
elephant
that
stand
up
these
play
their
allotted
parts
in
his
innocent
comedies
and
meanwhile
he
grows
steadily
in
sympathy
and
in
comprehension
of
the
circle
of
human
relationships
when
we
have
restored
playthings
to
their
place
in
education
a
place
which
assigns
them
the
principal
part
in
the
development
of
human
sympathies
we
can
later
on
put
in
the
hands
of
children
objects
whose
impressions
will
reach
their
minds
more
particularly
seguin
our
commissioner
of
education
to
the
universal
exhibition
at
vienna
philosophizes
most
charmingly
on
children
toys
in
his
report
chapter
on
the
training
of
special
senses
he
says
the
vast
array
of
playthings
separated
by
nationalities
left
at
first
sight
an
impression
of
silly
sameness
but
that
a
second
look
discovered
in
them
particular
characters
as
of
national
idiosyncrasies
and
a
closer
examination
showed
that
these
puerilities
had
sense
enough
in
them
not
only
to
disclose
the
movements
of
the
mind
but
to
predict
what
is
to
follow
he
classifies
the
toys
exhibited
and
in
so
doing
gives
us
delightful
and
valuable
generalizations
some
of
which
i
will
quote
chinese
and
japanese
toys
innumerable
as
was
to
have
been
expected
japanese
toys
much
brighter
the
dolls
relieved
in
gold
and
gaudy
colors
absolutely
saucy
the
application
of
the
natural
and
mechanical
forces
in
their
toys
can
not
fail
to
determine
the
taste
of
the
next
generation
towards
physical
sciences
chinese
dolls
are
sober
in
color
meek
in
demeanor
and
comprehensive
in
mien
the
favorite
chinese
toy
remains
the
theatrical
scene
where
the
family
is
treated
la
persia
sends
beautiful
toys
from
which
can
be
inferred
a
national
taste
for
music
since
most
of
their
dolls
are
blowing
instruments
turkey
egypt
arabia
have
sent
no
dolls
do
they
make
none
under
the
impression
correct
in
a
low
state
of
culture
that
dolls
for
children
become
idols
for
men
the
finlanders
and
laplanders
who
are
not
troubled
with
such
religious
prejudices
give
rosy
cheeks
and
bodies
as
fat
as
seals
to
their
dolls
the
french
toy
represents
the
versatility
of
the
nation
touching
every
topic
grave
or
grotesque
from
berlin
come
long
trains
of
artillery
regiments
of
lead
horse
and
foot
on
moving
tramways
from
the
hartz
and
the
alps
still
issue
those
wooden
herds
more
characteristic
of
the
dull
feelings
of
their
makers
than
of
the
instincts
of
the
animals
they
represent
the
american
toys
justify
the
rule
we
have
found
good
elsewhere
that
their
character
both
reveals
and
prefaces
the
national
tendencies
with
us
toys
refer
the
mind
and
habits
of
children
to
home
economy
husbandry
and
mechanical
labor
and
their
very
material
is
durable
mainly
wood
and
iron
so
from
childhood
every
people
has
its
sympathies
expressed
or
suppressed
and
set
deeper
in
its
flesh
and
blood
than
scholastic
ideas
the
children
who
have
no
toys
seize
realities
very
late
and
never
form
ideals
the
nations
rendered
famous
by
their
artists
artisans
and
idealists
have
supplied
their
infants
with
many
toys
for
there
is
more
philosophy
and
poetry
in
a
single
doll
than
in
a
thousand
books
if
you
will
tell
us
what
your
children
play
with
we
will
tell
you
what
sort
of
women
and
men
they
will
be
so
let
this
republic
make
the
toys
which
will
raise
the
moral
and
artistic
character
of
her
children
froebel
educational
toys
do
us
one
service
in
that
they
preach
a
silent
but
impressive
sermon
on
simplicity
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
hurlyburly
of
our
modern
life
is
not
wholly
favorable
to
the
simple
creed
of
childhood
delight
and
liberty
when
busy
or
at
rest
but
we
might
make
it
a
little
less
artificial
than
we
do
perhaps
every
thoughtful
person
knows
that
the
simple
natural
playthings
of
the
child
which
are
nothing
more
than
pegs
on
which
he
hangs
his
glowing
fancies
are
healthier
than
our
complicated
modern
mechanisms
in
which
the
child
has
only
to
press
the
button
and
the
toy
does
the
rest
the
doll
for
example
imagine
a
generation
of
children
brought
up
on
that
and
the
are
not
even
content
with
this
grand
personage
four
feet
high
who
says
papa
mamma
she
is
already
they
have
begun
to
improve
on
her
an
electrician
described
to
me
the
other
day
a
superb
new
altruistic
doll
fitted
to
the
needs
of
the
present
decade
you
are
to
press
a
judiciously
located
button
and
ask
her
the
test
question
which
is
if
she
will
have
some
candy
whereupon
with
an
angelic
located
in
the
left
cheek
she
is
to
answer
give
brother
piece
give
me
little
piece
if
the
thing
gets
out
of
order
and
i
devoutly
hope
it
will
it
will
doubtless
return
to
a
state
of
nature
and
horrify
the
bystanders
by
remarking
give
me
piece
give
brother
piece
think
of
having
a
gilded
dummy
like
that
given
you
to
amuse
yourself
with
think
of
having
to
play
to
forsooth
with
a
model
of
propriety
a
monstrosity
like
that
does
it
make
you
long
for
your
dear
old
darkey
doll
with
the
raveled
mouth
and
the
stuffing
leaking
out
of
her
legs
or
your
beloved
arabella
clarinda
with
the
broken
nose
beautiful
even
in
dissolution
creatures
not
too
bright
or
good
for
human
nature
daily
food
banged
battered
hairless
sharers
of
our
mad
joys
and
reckless
sorrows
how
we
loved
them
in
their
simple
ugliness
with
what
halos
of
romance
we
surrounded
them
with
what
devotion
we
nursed
the
one
with
the
broken
head
in
those
early
days
when
new
heads
were
not
to
be
bought
at
the
nearest
shop
and
even
if
they
could
have
been
purchased
for
us
would
we
the
primitive
children
of
those
dear
dark
ages
have
ever
thought
of
wrenching
off
the
cracked
blonde
head
of
ethelinda
and
buying
a
new
strange
nameless
brunette
head
gluing
it
calmly
on
body
as
a
small
acquaintance
of
mine
did
last
week
apparently
without
a
single
pang
never
a
doll
had
a
personality
in
those
times
and
has
yet
to
a
few
simple
backwoods
souls
even
in
this
day
and
generation
think
of
charles
kingsley
song
i
once
had
a
sweet
little
doll
dears
can
we
imagine
that
as
written
about
one
of
these
modern
monstrosities
with
eyeglasses
and
corsets
and
vinaigrettes
i
once
had
a
sweet
little
doll
dears
the
prettiest
doll
in
the
world
her
face
was
so
red
and
so
white
dears
and
her
hair
was
so
charmingly
curled
but
i
lost
my
poor
little
doll
dears
as
i
played
on
the
heath
one
day
and
i
sought
for
her
more
than
a
week
dears
but
i
never
could
find
where
she
lay
i
found
my
poor
little
doll
dears
as
i
played
on
the
heath
one
day
folks
say
she
is
terribly
changed
dears
for
her
paint
is
all
washed
away
and
her
arms
trodden
off
by
the
cows
dears
and
her
hair
not
the
least
bit
curled
yet
for
old
sake
sake
she
is
still
dears
the
prettiest
doll
in
the
world
long
live
the
doll
precious
lamb
jewel
jam
darling
take
away
the
doll
you
erase
from
the
heart
and
head
feelings
images
poetry
aspiration
experience
ready
for
application
to
real
life
every
mother
knows
the
development
of
tenderness
and
motherliness
that
goes
on
in
her
little
girl
through
the
nursing
and
petting
and
teaching
and
caring
for
her
doll
there
is
a
good
deal
of
journalistic
anxiety
concerning
the
decline
of
mothers
is
it
possible
that
fathers
too
are
in
any
danger
of
decline
it
is
impossible
to
overestimate
the
sacredness
and
importance
of
the
in
the
universe
but
the
is
not
positively
valueless
so
far
as
it
goes
the
talk
comparatively
little
about
developing
that
in
the
young
male
of
the
species
in
three
practical
experience
among
the
children
of
the
poorer
classes
and
during
all
the
succeeding
years
when
i
have
filled
the
honorary
and
honorable
offices
of
woman
and
to
their
royal
highnesses
some
thousands
of
babies
i
have
been
struck
with
the
greater
hardness
of
the
small
boys
a
certain
coarseness
of
fibre
and
lack
of
sensitiveness
which
makes
them
less
susceptible
at
first
to
gentle
influences
once
upon
a
time
i
set
about
developing
this
father
spirit
in
a
group
of
little
gamins
whose
general
attitude
toward
the
weaker
sex
toward
birds
and
flowers
and
insects
toward
beauty
in
distress
and
wounded
sensibility
was
in
the
last
degree
offensive
in
the
bird
games
we
had
always
had
a
mother
bird
in
the
nest
with
the
birdlings
we
now
introduced
a
father
bird
into
the
game
though
the
children
had
been
only
a
little
time
in
the
kindergarten
and
were
not
fully
baptized
into
the
spirit
of
play
still
the
boys
were
generally
willing
to
personate
the
father
bird
since
their
delight
in
the
active
and
manly
occupation
of
flying
about
the
room
seeking
worms
overshadowed
their
natural
repugnance
to
feeding
the
young
this
accomplished
we
played
master
rider
in
which
a
small
urchin
capered
about
on
a
hobby
horse
going
through
a
variety
of
adventures
and
finally
returning
with
presents
to
wife
and
children
this
in
turn
became
a
matter
of
natural
experience
and
we
moved
towards
our
grand
once
a
week
we
had
dolls
day
when
all
the
children
who
owned
them
brought
their
dolls
and
the
exercises
were
ordered
with
the
single
view
of
amusing
and
edifying
them
the
picture
of
that
circle
of
ragged
children
comes
before
me
now
and
dims
my
eyes
with
its
pathetic
suggestions
such
dolls
dolls
dolls
with
soiled
clothes
and
dolls
in
a
highly
indecorous
state
of
nudity
dolls
whose
ruddy
hues
of
health
had
been
absorbed
into
their
mothers
systems
dolls
made
of
rags
dolls
made
of
carrots
and
dolls
made
of
towels
but
all
dispensing
odors
of
garlic
in
the
common
air
maternal
affection
however
pardoned
all
limitations
and
they
were
clasped
as
fondly
to
maternal
bosoms
as
if
they
had
been
imported
from
paris
bless
my
soul
might
have
been
the
unspoken
comment
of
these
tiny
mothers
if
we
are
only
to
love
our
offspring
when
handsome
and
well
clothed
then
the
of
society
is
in
a
bad
way
dolls
day
was
the
day
for
lullabies
i
always
wished
i
might
gather
a
group
of
men
and
women
in
that
room
and
see
them
melt
under
the
magic
of
the
scene
perhaps
you
can
not
imagine
the
union
of
garlic
and
magic
nevertheless
o
ye
of
little
faith
it
may
exist
the
kindergarten
cradle
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
and
the
kindergarten
doll
clean
beautiful
and
well
dressed
lay
inside
the
curtains
waiting
to
be
sung
to
sleep
with
the
other
dolls
one
little
girl
after
another
would
go
proudly
to
the
mother
chair
and
rock
the
cradle
while
the
other
children
hummed
their
gentle
lullabies
at
this
juncture
even
the
older
boys
when
the
influence
of
the
music
had
stolen
in
upon
their
senses
would
glance
from
side
to
side
longingly
as
much
as
to
say
o
lord
why
didst
thou
not
make
thy
servant
a
female
that
he
might
dandle
one
of
these
interesting
objects
without
degradation
in
such
an
hour
i
suddenly
said
josephus
will
you
be
the
father
this
time
and
without
giving
him
a
second
to
think
we
began
our
familiar
lullaby
the
radical
nature
the
full
enormity
of
the
proposition
did
not
in
that
moment
of
sweet
expansion
strike
josephus
he
moved
towards
the
cradle
seated
himself
in
the
chair
put
his
foot
upon
the
rocker
and
rocked
the
baby
soberly
while
my
heart
sang
in
triumph
after
this
the
fathers
as
well
as
the
mothers
took
part
in
all
family
games
and
this
mighty
and
reform
had
been
worked
through
the
magic
of
a
fascinating
plaything
what
shall
children
read
what
we
make
children
love
and
desire
is
more
important
than
what
we
make
them
learn
when
i
was
a
little
girl
oh
six
most
charming
words
it
is
not
necessary
to
name
the
year
but
it
was
so
long
ago
that
children
were
still
reminded
that
they
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
and
also
that
they
could
eat
what
was
set
before
them
or
go
without
two
maxims
that
suggest
a
hoary
antiquity
of
time
not
easily
measured
by
the
senses
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
had
the
great
good
fortune
to
live
in
a
country
village
i
believe
i
always
had
a
taste
for
books
but
i
will
pass
over
that
early
period
when
i
manifested
it
by
carrying
them
to
my
mouth
and
endeavored
to
assimilate
their
contents
by
the
cramming
process
and
also
that
later
stage
which
heralded
the
dawn
of
the
critical
faculty
perhaps
when
i
tore
them
in
bits
and
held
up
the
tattered
fragments
with
shouts
of
derisive
laughter
unlike
the
critic
no
more
were
given
me
to
mar
but
like
the
critic
i
had
marred
a
good
many
ere
my
vandal
hand
was
stayed
as
soon
as
i
could
read
i
had
free
access
to
an
excellent
medical
library
the
gloom
of
which
was
brightened
by
a
few
shelves
of
theological
works
bequeathed
to
the
family
by
some
orthodox
ancestor
and
tempered
by
a
volume
or
two
of
blackstone
but
outside
of
these
which
were
emphatically
not
the
stuff
my
dreams
were
made
of
i
can
only
remember
a
certain
little
walnut
bookcase
hanging
on
the
wall
of
the
family
it
had
but
three
shelves
yet
all
the
mysteries
of
love
and
life
and
death
were
in
the
score
of
volumes
that
stood
there
side
by
side
and
we
turned
to
them
year
after
year
with
undiminished
interest
the
number
never
seemed
small
the
stories
never
grew
tame
when
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
third
shelf
we
simply
went
back
and
began
again
a
process
all
too
little
known
to
children
i
can
see
them
yet
those
rows
of
shabby
and
incongruous
volumes
the
contents
of
which
were
transferred
to
our
hungry
little
brains
some
of
them
are
close
at
hand
now
and
i
love
their
ragged
corners
their
pages
that
show
the
pressure
of
childish
thumbs
and
their
dear
old
backs
broken
in
my
service
there
was
a
book
of
snobs
vanity
fair
with
no
cover
at
all
scottish
chiefs
in
crimson
a
brown
copy
of
george
teverino
and
next
it
a
green
bailey
festus
which
i
only
attacked
when
mentally
rabid
and
a
little
of
which
went
a
surprisingly
long
way
and
then
a
maroon
david
copperfield
whose
pages
were
limp
with
my
kisses
to
write
a
book
that
a
child
would
kiss
oh
dear
reward
oh
sweet
sweet
fame
in
one
corner
spare
me
your
smiles
was
a
fat
autobiography
of
barnum
given
me
by
a
grateful
farmer
for
saving
the
life
of
a
valuable
jersey
calf
just
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
strangling
herself
this
book
so
inflamed
a
naturally
ardent
imagination
that
i
was
with
difficulty
dissuaded
from
entering
the
arena
as
a
circus
manager
considerations
of
age
or
sex
had
no
weight
with
me
and
lack
of
capital
eventually
proved
the
deterrent
force
on
the
shelf
above
were
kenilworth
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
half
of
rob
roy
i
have
always
hesitated
to
read
the
other
half
for
fear
that
it
should
not
end
precisely
as
i
made
it
end
when
i
was
forced
by
necessity
to
supplement
sir
walter
scott
then
there
was
gulliver
travels
and
if
any
of
the
stories
seemed
difficult
to
believe
i
had
only
to
turn
to
the
maps
of
lilliput
and
brobdingnag
with
the
degrees
of
latitude
and
longitude
duly
marked
which
always
convinced
me
that
everything
was
fair
and
aboveboard
of
course
there
was
a
great
green
and
gold
shakespeare
not
a
properly
expurgated
edition
for
female
seminaries
either
nor
even
prose
tales
from
shakespeare
adapted
to
young
readers
but
the
real
thing
we
expurgated
as
we
read
child
fashion
taking
into
our
sleek
little
heads
all
that
we
could
comprehend
or
apprehend
and
unconsciously
passing
over
what
might
have
been
hurtful
perhaps
at
a
later
period
i
suppose
we
failed
to
get
a
very
close
conception
of
shakespeare
colossal
genius
but
we
did
get
a
tremendous
and
lasting
impression
of
force
and
power
life
and
truth
when
we
declaimed
certain
scenes
in
an
upper
chamber
with
sloping
walls
and
dormer
windows
a
bed
for
a
throne
a
cotton
umbrella
for
a
sceptre
our
creations
were
harmless
enough
if
i
remember
rightly
our
lady
macbeths
and
iagos
falstaffs
and
cleopatras
after
they
had
been
dipped
in
the
divine
alembic
of
childish
innocence
came
out
so
respectable
that
they
would
not
have
brought
the
historic
blush
to
the
cheek
of
youth
on
the
shelf
above
the
shakespeare
were
a
few
things
presumably
better
suited
to
childish
tastes
hawthorne
wonder
book
water
babies
miss
edgeworth
rosamond
and
the
arabian
nights
there
were
also
two
little
tales
given
us
by
a
wandering
revivalist
who
was
on
a
starring
tour
through
the
new
england
villages
how
gussie
grew
in
grace
and
little
harriet
work
for
the
heathen
melodramatic
histories
of
spiritually
perfect
and
physically
feeble
children
who
blessed
the
world
for
a
season
but
died
young
enlivened
by
a
few
pages
devoted
to
completely
vicious
and
adorable
ones
who
lived
to
curse
the
world
to
a
good
old
age
last
of
all
brought
out
only
on
state
occasions
was
a
most
seductive
edition
of
that
nursery
gaboriau
who
killed
cock
robin
with
colored
illustrations
in
which
the
heads
of
the
birds
were
made
to
move
oracularly
by
means
of
cunningly
arranged
strips
pulled
from
the
bottom
of
the
page
this
was
a
relic
of
infancy
our
first
introduction
to
the
literature
of
plot
counterplot
intrigue
and
crime
and
the
mystery
of
the
murder
was
very
real
to
us
this
book
still
in
existence
with
all
the
birds
headless
from
is
always
inextricably
associated
in
my
mind
with
childish
woes
as
a
desire
on
my
part
to
make
the
birds
wag
their
heads
was
always
contemporaneous
to
a
second
with
a
like
desire
on
my
sister
part
and
on
those
rare
days
when
the
precious
volume
was
taken
down
one
of
us
always
donned
the
penitential
nightgown
early
in
the
afternoon
and
supped
frugally
in
bed
while
the
other
feasted
gloriously
at
the
family
board
never
quite
happy
in
her
virtue
however
since
it
separated
her
from
beloved
vice
in
disgrace
that
paltry
tattered
volume
when
it
confronts
me
from
its
safe
nook
in
a
bureau
drawer
makes
my
heart
beat
faster
and
sets
me
dreaming
pray
tell
me
if
any
book
read
in
your
later
and
wiser
years
ever
brings
to
your
mind
such
vivid
memories
to
your
lips
so
lingering
a
smile
to
your
eye
so
ready
a
tear
true
enough
we
could
never
have
loved
the
earth
so
well
if
we
had
had
no
childhood
in
it
what
novelty
is
worth
that
sweet
monotony
where
everything
is
known
and
loved
because
it
is
known
this
autobiographical
babble
is
excusable
for
one
reason
only
it
is
in
remembering
what
books
greatly
moved
us
in
earlier
days
what
books
wakened
strong
and
healthy
desires
enlarged
the
horizon
of
our
understanding
and
inspired
us
to
generous
action
that
we
get
some
clue
to
the
books
with
which
to
surround
our
children
and
a
reminiscence
of
this
kind
becomes
a
sort
of
psychological
observation
the
moment
we
realize
clearly
that
the
books
we
read
in
childhood
and
youth
make
a
profound
impression
that
can
never
be
repeated
later
save
in
some
rare
crisis
of
heart
and
soul
where
a
printed
page
marks
an
epoch
in
one
mental
or
spiritual
life
then
we
become
reinforced
in
our
opinion
that
it
makes
a
deal
of
difference
what
children
read
and
how
they
read
it
agnes
repplier
says
it
is
part
of
the
irony
of
life
that
our
discriminating
taste
for
books
should
be
built
up
on
the
ashes
of
an
extinct
enjoyment
a
book
is
such
a
fact
to
children
its
people
are
so
alive
and
so
heartily
loved
and
hated
its
scenes
so
absolutely
real
prone
on
the
before
the
fire
or
curled
in
the
window
seat
they
forget
everything
but
the
story
the
shadows
deepen
until
they
can
read
no
longer
but
they
do
not
much
care
for
the
window
looks
into
an
enchanted
region
peopled
with
brilliant
fancies
the
old
garden
is
sometimes
the
forest
of
arden
sometimes
the
land
of
lilliput
sometimes
the
border
the
gray
rock
on
the
river
bank
is
now
the
cave
of
monte
cristo
and
now
a
castle
defended
by
scores
of
armed
knights
who
peep
one
by
one
from
the
while
fair
ellen
and
the
lovely
undine
float
together
on
the
quiet
stream
for
forming
a
truly
admirable
literary
taste
i
can
not
indeed
say
much
in
favor
of
my
own
motley
collection
of
books
just
mentioned
for
i
was
simply
tumbled
in
among
them
and
left
to
browse
in
accordance
with
charles
lamb
whimsical
plan
for
bridget
elia
more
might
have
been
added
and
some
taken
away
but
they
had
in
them
a
world
of
instruction
and
illumination
which
children
miss
who
read
too
exclusively
those
books
written
with
rigid
determination
down
to
their
level
neglecting
certain
old
classics
for
which
we
fondly
believe
there
are
no
substitutes
you
can
not
always
persuade
the
children
of
this
generation
to
attack
robinson
crusoe
and
if
they
do
they
are
too
sophisticated
to
thrill
properly
when
they
come
to
footsteps
in
the
sand
think
of
it
my
contemporaries
think
of
substituting
for
that
intense
moment
some
of
the
modern
tuppenny
climaxes
i
do
not
wish
to
drift
into
a
cheap
cynicism
and
apotheosize
the
old
days
at
the
expense
of
the
new
we
are
often
inclined
to
paint
the
past
with
a
halo
round
its
head
which
it
never
wore
when
it
was
the
present
we
can
reproduce
neither
the
children
nor
the
conditions
of
fifty
or
even
years
ago
children
must
be
fitted
for
tasks
educated
to
answer
questions
equipped
to
solve
problems
but
are
we
helping
them
to
do
this
in
absolutely
the
best
way
at
all
events
it
is
difficult
to
join
in
the
paean
of
gratitude
for
the
tons
of
children
books
that
are
turned
out
yearly
by
parental
publishers
if
the
children
of
the
past
did
not
have
quite
enough
deference
paid
to
their
individuality
their
likes
and
dislikes
and
if
their
needs
were
too
often
left
until
the
needs
of
everybody
else
had
been
considered
on
the
other
hand
they
were
not
surfeited
with
but
attentions
if
the
hay
was
thrown
so
high
in
the
rack
that
they
could
not
pluck
a
single
straw
without
stretching
up
for
it
why
the
hay
was
generally
worth
stretching
for
and
was
perhaps
quite
as
healthful
as
the
sweet
and
easily
digested
nursery
porridge
which
some
people
adopt
as
exclusive
diet
for
their
darlings
nowadays
let
us
look
a
little
at
some
of
the
famous
children
books
of
a
past
generation
and
see
what
was
their
general
style
and
purpose
take
for
instance
those
of
barbauld
who
may
be
included
in
that
group
of
men
and
women
who
completely
altered
the
style
of
teaching
and
writing
for
children
rousseau
de
genlis
the
edgeworths
jacotot
froebel
and
diesterweg
all
great
teachers
didactic
barbauld
who
composed
as
one
of
her
biographers
tells
us
a
considerable
number
of
miscellaneous
pieces
for
the
instruction
and
amusement
of
young
persons
especially
females
girls
were
always
young
females
in
those
days
children
were
infants
and
stories
were
tales
who
can
ever
forget
those
early
lessons
written
for
her
adopted
son
charles
who
appeared
in
the
page
sometimes
in
a
state
of
hopeless
ignorance
and
imbecility
and
sometimes
clad
in
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
the
use
of
the
offensive
phrase
excessively
pretty
as
applied
to
a
lace
tidy
by
a
very
tiny
female
named
lucy
brings
down
upon
her
sinful
head
eleven
pages
of
such
moralizing
as
would
only
be
delivered
by
a
modern
mamma
on
hearing
a
confession
of
robbery
or
murder
all
this
does
strike
us
as
insufferably
didactic
yet
we
can
not
approve
the
virulence
with
which
southey
and
charles
lamb
attacked
good
barbauld
in
her
old
age
for
her
purpose
was
eminently
earnest
her
views
of
education
healthy
and
sensible
for
the
time
in
which
she
lived
her
style
polished
and
admirably
quiet
her
love
for
young
people
indubitably
sincere
and
profound
and
her
character
worthy
of
all
respect
and
admiration
in
its
dignity
womanliness
and
strength
nevertheless
charles
lamb
exclaims
in
a
whimsical
burst
of
spleen
two
shoes
is
out
of
print
while
barbauld
and
mrs
trimmer
nonsense
lies
in
piles
around
hang
them
the
cursed
reasoning
crew
those
blights
and
blasts
of
all
that
is
human
in
man
and
child
miss
edgeworth
has
what
seems
to
us
in
these
days
the
same
overplus
of
sublime
purpose
and
though
a
much
greater
writer
is
quite
as
desirous
of
being
instructive
first
last
and
all
the
time
and
quite
as
unable
or
unwilling
to
veil
her
purpose
no
books
however
have
ever
had
a
more
remarkable
influence
upon
young
people
and
there
are
many
of
them
as
they
are
which
the
sophisticated
children
of
could
read
with
pleasure
and
profit
poor
naughty
rosamond
choosing
the
immortal
purple
jar
out
of
that
apothecary
window
instead
of
the
shoes
she
needed
and
in
a
following
chapter
after
pages
of
excellent
maternal
advice
taking
the
hideous
but
useful
red
morocco
housewife
instead
of
the
coveted
plum
people
may
say
what
they
like
of
miss
edgeworth
lack
of
proportion
as
a
moralist
and
economist
but
we
have
few
writers
for
children
at
present
who
possess
the
practical
knowledge
mental
vigor
and
moral
force
which
made
her
an
imposing
figure
in
juvenile
literature
for
nearly
a
century
there
has
never
been
a
time
when
the
difficulty
of
making
a
good
use
of
books
was
as
great
as
it
is
or
a
time
when
it
required
so
much
decision
to
make
a
wise
choice
simply
because
there
is
so
much
printed
matter
precipitated
upon
us
that
we
can
not
see
the
wood
for
the
trees
it
is
not
my
province
to
discriminate
between
the
various
writers
for
children
at
the
present
time
to
give
a
complete
catalogue
of
useful
books
for
children
would
be
quite
impossible
to
give
a
partial
list
or
endeavor
to
point
out
what
is
worthy
and
what
unworthy
would
be
little
better
no
course
of
reading
laid
down
by
one
person
ever
suits
another
and
the
published
lists
of
best
books
with
their
solemn
platitudes
in
the
way
of
advice
are
generally
interesting
only
in
their
reflection
of
the
writer
personality
i
would
not
choose
too
absolutely
for
a
child
save
in
his
earliest
years
but
would
rather
surround
him
with
the
best
and
worthiest
books
and
let
him
choose
for
himself
for
there
are
elective
affinities
and
antipathies
here
that
need
not
be
disregarded
that
are
indeed
certain
indications
of
latent
powers
and
trustworthy
guides
to
the
child
unfolding
possibilities
books
can
only
be
profoundly
influential
as
they
unite
themselves
with
decisive
tendencies
provide
the
right
conditions
for
mental
growth
and
then
let
the
child
do
the
growing
if
we
dictate
too
absolutely
we
instead
of
his
mind
and
weaken
his
power
of
choice
on
the
other
hand
we
do
not
wish
his
reading
to
be
partial
or
as
it
may
be
without
intelligent
oversight
i
was
telling
bedtime
stories
the
other
night
to
a
proper
wise
dull
little
girl
of
ten
years
when
i
had
successfully
introduced
a
and
kittens
to
her
attention
i
plunged
into
what
i
thought
a
graphic
and
perfectly
natural
conversation
between
them
when
she
cut
me
short
with
the
observation
that
she
disliked
stories
in
which
animals
talked
because
they
were
not
true
i
was
rebuked
and
tried
again
with
better
success
until
there
came
an
unlucky
figure
of
speech
concerning
a
blossoming
that
bent
its
green
boughs
and
laughed
in
the
summer
sunshine
because
its
flowers
were
fragrant
and
lovely
and
the
world
so
green
and
beautiful
this
she
thought
on
sober
second
thought
a
trifle
silly
as
trees
never
did
laugh
now
that
exasperating
scrap
of
humanity
she
is
abnormal
to
be
sure
ought
to
be
locked
up
and
fed
upon
fairy
tales
until
she
is
able
to
catch
a
faint
glimpse
of
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land
poor
blind
deaf
little
person
predestined
perhaps
to
be
the
mother
of
a
lot
of
other
blind
deaf
little
persons
some
day
how
i
should
like
to
develop
her
imagination
whatever
children
read
let
us
see
that
it
is
good
of
its
kind
and
that
it
gives
variety
so
that
no
integral
want
of
human
nature
shall
be
neglected
so
that
neither
imagination
memory
nor
reflection
shall
be
starved
i
own
it
is
difficult
to
help
them
in
their
choice
when
most
of
us
have
not
learned
to
choose
wisely
for
ourselves
a
discriminating
taste
in
literature
is
not
to
be
gained
without
effort
and
our
constant
reading
of
the
little
books
spoils
our
appetite
for
the
great
ones
style
is
a
matter
of
some
moment
even
at
this
early
stage
mothers
sometimes
forget
that
children
can
not
read
slipshod
awkward
redundant
prose
and
vapid
verse
for
ten
or
twelve
years
and
then
take
kindly
to
the
best
things
afterward
long
before
a
child
is
conscious
of
such
a
thing
as
purity
delicacy
directness
or
strength
of
style
he
has
been
acted
upon
unconsciously
so
that
when
the
period
of
conscious
choice
comes
he
is
either
attracted
or
repelled
by
what
is
good
according
to
his
training
children
are
fond
of
vivacity
and
color
and
love
a
bit
of
word
painting
or
graceful
nonsense
but
there
are
people
who
strive
for
this
and
miss
after
all
the
true
warmth
and
geniality
that
is
most
desirable
for
little
people
apropos
of
nonsense
we
remember
leigh
hunt
who
says
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
nonsense
one
resulting
from
a
superabundance
of
ideas
the
other
from
a
want
of
them
style
in
the
hands
of
some
writers
is
like
to
the
savage
of
no
perceptible
value
unless
it
is
laid
on
thick
our
little
ones
begin
too
often
on
cheap
and
tawdry
stories
in
one
or
two
syllables
where
pictures
in
primary
colors
try
their
best
to
atone
for
lack
of
matter
then
they
enter
on
a
prolonged
series
of
children
books
some
of
them
written
by
people
who
have
neither
the
intelligence
nor
the
literary
skill
to
write
for
a
more
critical
audience
on
the
same
basis
of
reasoning
which
puts
the
young
and
inexperienced
teachers
into
the
lowest
grades
where
the
mind
ought
to
be
formed
and
assigns
to
the
more
practiced
the
simpler
task
of
the
already
partially
formed
or
mind
there
has
never
been
such
conscientious
intelligent
and
purposeful
work
done
for
children
as
in
the
last
ten
years
and
if
an
overwhelming
flood
of
trash
has
been
poured
into
our
laps
along
with
the
better
things
we
must
accept
the
inevitable
the
legends
myths
and
fables
of
the
world
as
well
as
its
history
and
romance
are
being
brought
within
reach
of
young
readers
by
writers
of
wide
knowledge
and
trained
skill
knowing
then
as
we
do
the
dangers
and
obstacles
in
the
way
and
realizing
the
innumerable
inspirations
which
the
best
thought
gives
to
us
can
we
not
so
direct
the
reading
of
our
children
that
our
older
boys
and
girls
shall
not
be
so
exclusively
modern
in
their
tastes
so
that
they
may
be
inclined
to
take
a
little
less
saltus
a
little
more
shakespeare
temper
their
devotion
to
kipling
by
small
doses
of
dante
forsake
the
duchess
for
a
dip
into

and
use

as
a
safe
and
agreeable
antidote
to

we
need
not
despair
of
the
child
who
does
not
care
to
read
for
books
are
not
the
only
means
of
culture
but
they
are
a
very
great
means
when
the
mind
is
really
stimulated
and
not
simply
padded
with
them
frederic
harrison
says
books
are
no
more
education
than
laws
are
virtue
of
all
men
perhaps
the
needs
most
to
be
reminded
that
man
business
here
is
to
know
for
the
sake
of
living
not
to
live
for
the
sake
of
knowing
but
a
child
who
has
no
taste
for
reading
who
is
utterly
incapable
of
losing
himself
in
a
printed
page
quite
unable
to
forget
his
childish
griefs
and
plunge
soul
forward
headlong
into
a
book
profound
impassioned
for
its
beauty
and
salt
of
truth
such
a
child
is
to
be
pitied
as
missing
one
of
the
chief
joys
of
life
such
a
child
has
no
dear
old
to
look
back
upon
he
has
no
sweet
associations
with
certain
musty
covers
and
pages
no
sacred
memories
of
quiet
moments
when
a
new
love
of
goodness
a
new
throb
of
generosity
a
new
sense
of
humanity
were
born
in
the
ardent
young
soul
born
when
we
had
turned
the
last
page
of
some
volume
and
pressed
our
childish
cheek
against
the
window
pane
when
it
was
growing
dusk
without
and
a
mother
voice
called
us
from
our
shelter
to
lay
the
book
down
dear
and
come
to
tea
for
to
speak
in
better
words
than
my
own
it
is
the
books
we
read
before
middle
life
that
do
most
to
mould
our
characters
and
influence
our
lives
and
this
not
only
because
our
natures
are
then
plastic
and
our
opinions
flexible
but
also
because
to
produce
lasting
impression
it
is
necessary
to
give
a
great
author
time
and
meditation
the
books
that
are
with
us
in
the
leisure
of
youth
that
we
love
for
a
time
not
only
with
the
enthusiasm
but
with
something
of
the
exclusiveness
of
a
first
love
are
those
that
enter
as
factors
forever
in
our
mental
life
children
stories
to
be
a
good
is
to
be
a
king
among
children
the
business
of
is
carried
on
from
the
soundest
of
economic
motives
in
order
to
supply
a
constant
and
growing
demand
we
are
forced
to
satisfy
the
clamorous
that
beset
us
on
every
hand
beside
us
stands
an
eager
little
creature
quivering
with
expectation
gazing
with
eyes
and
saying
appealingly
tell
me
a
story
or
perhaps
a
circle
of
toddlers
is
gathered
round
each
one
offering
the
same
fervent
prayer
with
so
much
trust
and
confidence
expressed
in
look
and
gesture
that
none
but
a
barbarian
could
bear
to
disappoint
it
the
is
the

special
property
when
once
his
gifts
have
been
found
out
he
may
bid
to
his
quiet
snooze
by
the
fire
or
his
peaceful
rest
with
a
favorite
book
though
he
hide
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
house
yet
will
he
be
discovered
and
made
to
deliver
up
his
treasure
on
this
one
subject
at
least
the
little
ones
of
the
earth
are
a
solid
unanimous
body
for
never
yet
was
seen
the
child
who
did
not
love
the
story
and
prize
the
perhaps
we
never
dreamed
of
practicing
the
art
of
till
we
were
drawn
into
it
by
the
imperious
commands
of
the
little
ones
about
us
it
is
an
untrodden
path
to
us
and
we
scarcely
understand
as
yet
its
difficulties
and
hindrances
its
breadth
and
its
possibilities
yet
this
eager
unceasing
demand
of
the
we
must
learn
to
supply
and
supply
wisely
for
we
must
not
think
that
all
the
food
we
give
the
little
one
will
be
sure
to
agree
with
him
because
he
is
so
hungry
this
would
be
no
more
true
of
a
mental
than
of
a
physical
diet
what
objects
then
shall
our
stories
serve
beyond
the
important
one
of
pleasing
the
little
listeners
how
can
we
make
them
distinctly
serviceable
filling
the
difficult
and
impossible
of
useful
as
well
as
ornamental
there
are
of
course
certain
general
benefits
which
the
child
gains
in
the
hearing
of
all
stories
these
are
familiarity
with
good
english
cultivation
of
the
imagination
development
of
sympathy
and
clear
impression
of
moral
truth
we
shall
find
however
that
all
stories
appropriate
for
young
children
naturally
divide
themselves
into
the
following
classes
i
the
purely
imaginative
or
fanciful
and
here
belongs
the
fairy
story
ii
the
realistic
devoted
to
things
which
have
happened
and
might
could
would
or
should
happen
without
violence
to
probability
these
are
generally
the
vehicle
for
moral
lessons
which
are
all
the
more
impressive
because
not
insisted
on
iii
the
scientific
conveying
bits
of
information
about
animals
flowers
rocks
and
stars
iv
the
historical
or
simple
interesting
accounts
of
the
lives
of
heroes
and
events
in
our
country
struggle
for
life
and
liberty
there
is
a
great
difference
in
opinion
regarding
the
advisability
of
telling
fairy
stories
to
very
young
children
and
there
can
be
no
question
that
some
of
them
are
entirely
undesirable
and
inappropriate
those
containing
a
fierce
or
horrible
element
must
of
course
be
promptly
ruled
out
of
court
including
the
bluggy
tales
of
cruel
stepmothers
ferocious
giants
and
ogres
which
fill
the
fairy
literature
yet
those
which
are
pure
in
tone
and
gay
with
fanciful
coloring
may
surely
be
told
occasionally
if
only
for
the
quickening
of
the
imagination
perhaps
however
it
is
best
to
keep
them
as
a
sort
of
sweetmeat
to
be
taken
on
high
days
and
holidays
only
let
us
be
realistic
by
all
means
but
beware
o
of
being
too
realistic
avoid
the
shuddering
tale
of
the
wicked
boy
who
stoned
the
birds
lest
some
hearer
be
inspired
to
try
the
dreadful
experiment
and
see
if
it
really
does
kill
tell
not
the
story
of
the
bears
who
were
set
on
a
hot
stove
to
learn
to
dance
for
children
quickly
learn
to
gloat
over
the
horrible
deal
with
the
positive
rather
than
the
negative
in
learn
to
affirm
not
to
deny
some
one
perhaps
will
say
here
the
knowledge
of
cruelty
and
sin
must
come
some
time
to
the
child
then
why
shield
him
from
it
now
true
it
must
come
but
take
heed
that
you
be
not
the
one
to
introduce
it
arbitrarily
stand
far
off
from
childhood
says
jean
paul
and
brush
not
away
the
with
your
rough
fist
the
truths
of
botany
of
mineralogy
of
zoology
may
be
woven
into
attractive
stories
which
will
prove
as
interesting
to
the
child
as
the
most
extravagant
fairy
tale
but
endeavor
to
shape
your
narrative
so
dexterously
around
the
bit
of
knowledge
you
wish
to
convey
that
it
may
be
the
pivotal
point
of
interest
that
the
child
may
not
suspect
for
a
moment
your
intention
of
instructing
him
under
the
guise
of
amusement
should
this
dark
suspicion
cross
his
mind
your
power
is
weakened
from
that
moment
and
he
will
look
upon
you
henceforth
as
a
deeply
dyed
hypocrite
the
historic
story
is
easily
told
and
universally
interesting
if
you
make
it
sufficiently
clear
and
simple
the
account
of
the
first
thanksgiving
day
of
the
discovery
of
america
of
the
origin
of
independence
day
of
the
boyhood
of
our
nation
heroes
all
these
can
be
made
intelligible
and
charming
to
children
i
suggest
topics
dealing
with
our
own
country
only
because
the
child
must
learn
to
know
the
before
he
can
appreciate
the
remote
it
is
best
that
he
should
gain
some
idea
of
the
growth
of
his
own
traditions
before
he
wanders
into
the
history
of
other
lands
in
any
story
which
has
to
do
with
soldiers
and
battles
do
not
be
too
martial
do
not
permeate
your
tale
with
the
roar
of
guns
the
smell
of
powder
and
the
cries
of
the
wounded
inculcate
as
much
as
possible
the
idea
of
a
struggle
for
a
principle
and
omit
the
horrors
of
war
we
must
remember
that
upon
the
kind
of
stories
we
tell
the
child
depends
much
of
his
later
taste
in
literature
we
can
easily
create
a
hunger
for
highly
spiced
and
sensational
writing
by
telling
grotesque
and
horrible
tales
in
childhood
when
the
little
one
has
learned
to
read
when
he
holds
the
key
to
the
mystery
of
books
then
he
will
seek
in
them
the
same
food
which
so
gratified
his
palate
in
earlier
years
we
are
just
beginning
to
realize
the
importance
of
beginnings
in
education
true
a
king
of
israel
whose
wisdom
is
greatly
extolled
and
whose
writings
are
widely
read
urged
the
importance
of
the
early
training
of
children
about
three
thousand
years
ago
but
the
progress
of
truth
in
the
world
is
proverbially
slow
when
parents
and
teachers
legislators
and
lawgivers
are
at
last
heartily
convinced
of
the
inestimable
importance
of
the
first
six
years
of
childhood
then
the
plays
and
occupations
of
that
formative
period
of
life
will
no
longer
be
neglected
or
left
to
chance
and
the
exercise
of
will
assume
its
proper
place
as
an
educative
influence
long
ago
when
i
was
just
beginning
the
study
of
childhood
and
when
all
its
possibilities
were
rising
before
me
up
up
from
glory
to
glory
long
ago
i
was
asked
to
give
what
i
considered
the
qualifications
of
an
ideal
kindergartner
my
answer
was
as
follows
brief
perhaps
but
certainly
comprehensive
the
music
of
cecilia
the
art
of
raphael
the
dramatic
genius
of
rachel
the
administrative
ability
of
cromwell
the
wisdom
of
solomon
the
meekness
of
moses
and
the
patience
of
job
twelve
years
experience
with
children
has
not
lowered
my
ideals
one
whit
nor
led
me
to
deem
superfluous
any
of
these
qualifications
in
fact
i
should
make
the
list
a
little
longer
were
i
to
write
it
now
and
should
add
perhaps
the
prudence
of
franklin
the
inventive
power
of
edison
and
the
talent
for
improvisation
of
the
early
troubadours
the
troubadours
indeed
could
they
return
to
the
earth
would
wander
about
lonely
and
unwelcomed
till
they
found
home
and
refuge
in
the
hospitable
atmosphere
of
the
kindergarten
the
only
spot
in
the
busy
modern
world
where
delighted
audiences
still
gather
around
the
professional
if
i
were
asked
to
furnish
a
recipe
for
one
of
these
professional
these
spinners
of
childish
narratives
i
should
suggest
one
measure
of
pure
literary
taste
two
of
gesture
and
illustration
three
of
dramatic
fire
and
four
of
ready
speech
and
clear
expression
if
to
these
you
add
a
pinch
of
tact
and
sympathy
the
compound
should
be
a
toothsome
one
and
certain
to
agree
with
all
who
taste
it
and
now
as
to
the
kind
of
story
our
professional
is
to
tell
in
selecting
this
the
first
point
to
consider
is
its
suitability
to
the
audience
a
story
for
very
little
ones
three
or
four
years
old
perhaps
must
be
simple
bright
and
full
of
action
they
do
not
yet
know
how
to
listen
their
comprehension
of
language
is
very
limited
and
their
sympathies
quite
undeveloped
nor
are
they
prepared
to
take
wing
with
you
into
the
lofty
realms
of
the
imagination
the
adventures
of
the
playful
kitten
of
the
birdling
learning
to
fly
of
the
lost
ball
of
the
faithful
dog
things
which
lie
within
their
experience
and
belong
to
the
sweet
familiar
atmosphere
of
the
household
these
they
enjoy
and
understand
it
will
be
found
also
that
the
number
of
children
to
whom
one
is
talking
is
a
prominent
factor
in
the
problem
of
selecting
a
story
two
or
three
little
ones
gathered
close
about
you
may
pay
strict
attention
to
a
quiet
calm
eventless
history
but
a
circle
of
twenty
or
thirty
eager
restless
little
people
needs
more
sparkle
and
incident
if
one
is
addressing
a
large
number
of
children
the
homes
from
which
they
come
must
be
considered
children
of
refined
cultivated
parents
who
have
listened
to
family
conversation
who
have
been
talked
to
and
encouraged
to
express
themselves
these
are
able
to
understand
much
more
lofty
themes
than
the
poor
little
mites
who
are
only
familiar
with
plain
practical
ideas
and
rough
speech
confined
to
the
most
ordinary
wants
of
life
and
now
after
the
story
is
well
selected
how
long
shall
it
be
it
is
impossible
to
fix
an
exact
limit
to
the
time
it
should
occupy
for
much
depends
on
the
age
and
the
number
of
the
children
i
am
reminded
again
of
recipes
and
of
the
dismay
of
the
inexperienced
cook
when
she
reads
stir
in
flour
enough
to
make
a
stiff
batter
alas
how
is
she
who
has
never
made
a
stiff
batter
to
settle
the
exact
amount
of
flour
necessary
i
might
give
certain
suggestions
as
to
time
such
as
close
while
the
interest
is
still
fresh
or
do
not
make
the
tale
so
long
as
to
weary
the
children
but
after
all
these
are
only
directions
in
this
as
in
many
other
departments
of
work
with
children
one
must
learn
in
that
dear
school
which
experience
keeps
five
minutes
however
is
quite
long
enough
with
the
babies
and
you
will
find
that
twice
this
time
spent
with
the
older
children
will
give
room
for
a
tale
of
absorbing
interest
with
appropriate
introduction
and
artistic
as
one
of
the
chief
values
of
the
exercise
is
the
familiarity
with
good
english
which
it
gives
i
need
not
say
that
especial
attention
must
be
paid
to
the
phraseology
in
which
the
story
is
clothed
many
persons
who
never
write
ungrammatically
are
inaccurate
in
speech
and
the
very
familiarity
and
ease
of
manner
which
the
must
assume
may
lead
her
into
colloquialisms
and
careless
expressions
of
course
however
the
language
must
be
simple
the
words
for
the
most
part
saxon
no
ponderous
johnsonian
expressions
should
drag
their
slow
length
through
the
recital
entangling
in
their
folds
the
comprehension
of
the
child
nor
on
the
other
hand
need
we
confine
ourselves
to
monosyllables
adopting
the
bald
style
of
primers
and
first
readers
it
is
quite
possible
to
talk
simply
and
yet
with
grace
and
feeling
and
we
may
be
sure
that
children
invariably
appreciate
poetry
of
expression
the
story
should
always
be
accompanied
with
gestures
simple
free
unstudied
motions
descriptive
perhaps
of
the
sweep
of
the
mother
bird
wings
as
she
soars
away
from
the
nest
or
the
waving
of
the
branches
as
he
sings
to
himself
in
the
sunshine
this
universal
language
is
understood
at
once
by
the
children
and
not
only
serves
as
an
interpreter
of
words
and
ideas
but
gives
life
and
attraction
to
the
exercise
illustrations
either
impromptu
or
carefully
prepared
beforehand
are
always
hailed
with
delight
by
the
children
nor
need
you
hesitate
to
try
your
hand
at
this
work
never
mind
if
you
can
not
draw
it
must
be
a
rude
picture
indeed
which
is
not
enjoyed
by
an
audience
of
little
people
their
vivid
imaginations
will
triumph
over
all
difficulties
and
enable
them
to
see
the
ideal
shining
through
the
real
it
is
well
now
and
then
also
to
have
the
children
illustrate
the
story
their
drawings
if
executed
quite
without
help
are
most
interesting
from
a
psychological
standpoint
and
will
afford
great
delight
to
you
as
well
as
to
the
little
artists
themselves
the
stories
can
also
be
illustrated
with
clay
modeling
an
idealized
very
dear
to
children
they
soon
become
quite
expert
in
moulding
simple
objects
and
enjoy
the
work
with
all
the
capacity
of
their
childish
hearts
now
and
then
encourage
the
little
ones
to
repeat
what
they
remember
of
the
tale
you
have
told
or
to
tell
something
new
on
the
same
theme
if
the
story
you
have
given
has
been
within
their
range
and
on
a
familiar
subject
a
torrent
of
infantile
reminiscence
will
immediately
gush
forth
and
you
will
have
a
miniature
experience
meeting
if
you
have
been
telling
a
dog
story
for
instance
i
hed
a
dog
cries
jimmy
breathlessly
and
is
just
about
to
tell
some
startling
incident
concerning
him
when
nickey
pipes
up
and
so
hed
i
and
the
pound
man
tuk
him
and
so
on
all
around
the
circle
in
the
free
kindergarten
each
child
palpitating
with
eagerness
to
give
you
his
bit
of
personal
experience
gather
the
little
ones
as
near
to
you
as
possible
when
you
are
telling
stories
the
tiniest
in
your
lap
the
others
cuddled
at
your
knee
this
is
easily
managed
in
the
nursery
but
is
more
difficult
with
a
large
circle
of
children
with
the
latter
you
can
but
seat
yourself
among
the
wee
ones
confident
that
the
interest
of
the
story
will
hold
the
attention
of
the
older
children
what
a
happy
hour
it
is
this
one
of
dear
and
sacred
to
every
what
an
eager
delightful
audience
are
these
little
ones
grieving
at
the
sorrows
of
the
heroes
laughing
at
their
happy
successes
breathless
with
anxiety
lest
the
cat
catch
the
disobedient
mouse
clapping
hands
when
the
ugly
duckling
is
changed
into
the
swan
all
appreciation
all
interest
all
joy
we
might
count
the
rest
of
the
world
well
lost
could
we
ever
be
surrounded
by
such
blooming
faces
such
loving
hearts
and
such
ready
sympathy
the
relation
of
the
kindergarten
to
social
reform
new
social
and
individual
wants
demand
new
solutions
of
the
problem
of
education
social
reform
it
is
always
rather
an
phrase
it
seems
as
if
one
ought
to
be
a
philosopher
even
to
approach
so
august
a
subject
the
kindergarten
a
simple
unpretentious
place
where
a
lot
of
tiny
children
work
and
play
together
a
place
into
which
if
the
man
of
business
chanced
to
glance
and
if
he
did
not
stay
long
enough
or
come
often
enough
would
conclude
that
the
children
were
frittering
away
their
time
particularly
if
that
same
good
man
of
business
had
weighed
and
measured
and
calculated
so
long
that
he
had
lost
the
seeing
eye
and
understanding
heart
some
years
ago
a
san
francisco
kindergartner
was
threading
her
way
through
a
dirty
alley
making
friendly
visits
to
the
children
of
her
flock
as
she
lingered
on
a
certain
receiving
the
last
confidences
of
some
weary
woman
heart
she
heard
a
loud
but
not
unfriendly
voice
ringing
from
an
upper
window
of
a
just
round
the
corner
clear
things
from
under
foot
pealed
the
voice
in
stentorian
accents
the
teacher
o
the
is
comin
down
the
street
eureka
thought
the
teacher
with
a
smile
there
a
bit
of
sympathetic
translation
for
you
at
last
the
german
word
has
been
put
into
the
vernacular
the
odd
foreign
syllables
have
been
taken
to
the
ignorant
mother
by
the
lisping
child
and
the
have
become
the
guards
heaven
bless
the
rough
translation
colloquial
as
it
is
no
royal
accolade
could
be
dearer
to
its
recipients
than
this
quaint
new
christening
what
has
the
kindergarten
to
do
with
social
reform
what
bearing
have
its
theory
and
practice
upon
the
conduct
of
life
a
guardian
of
the
peace
remarked
to
a
gentleman
on
a
if
we
could
open
more
kindergartens
sir
we
could
almost
shut
up
the
penitentiaries
sir
we
heard
the
sentiment
applauded
it
and
promptly
printed
it
on
the
cover
of
three
thousand
reports
but
on
calm
reflection
it
appears
like
an
exaggerated
statement
i
am
not
sure
that
a
kindergarten
in
every
ward
of
every
city
in
america
would
almost
shut
up
the
penitentiaries
sir
the
most
determined
optimist
is
weighed
down
by
the
feeling
that
it
will
take
more
than
the
ardent
prosecution
of
any
one
reform
however
vital
to
produce
such
a
result
we
appoint
investigating
committees
who
ask
more
and
more
questions
compile
more
and
more
statistics
and
get
more
and
more
confused
every
year
are
our
criminals
native
or
foreign
born
that
we
may
know
whether
we
are
worse
or
better
than
other
people
have
they
ever
learned
a
trade
that
we
may
prove
what
we
already
know
that
idle
fingers
are
the
devil
tools
have
they
been
educated
by
any
one
of
the
sorry
methods
that
take
shelter
under
that
word
that
we
may
know
whether
ignorance
is
a
bliss
or
a

they
married
or
single
that
we
may
determine
the
influence
of

ties

been
given
to
the
use
of
liquor
that
we
may
heap
proof
on
proof
mountain
high
against
the
monster
evil
of
intemperance
what
has
been
their
family
history
that
we
may
know
how
heavily
the
law
of
heredity
has
laid
its
burdens
upon
them
burning
questions
all
if
we
would
find
out
the
causes
of
crime
to
discover
the
why
and
wherefore
of
things
is
a
law
of
human
thought
the
reform
schools
penitentiaries
prisons
insane
asylums
hospitals
and
poorhouses
are
all
filled
to
overflowing
and
it
is
entirely
sensible
to
inquire
how
the
people
came
there
and
to
relieve
pardon
bless
cure
or
reform
them
as
far
as
we
can
meanwhile
as
we
are
dismissing
or
blessing
or
burying
the
unfortunates
from
the
imposing
front
gates
of
our
institutions
new
throngs
are
crowding
in
at
the
little
back
doors
life
is
a
bridge
full
of
gaping
holes
over
which
we
must
all
travel
a
thousand
evils
of
human
misery
and
wickedness
flow
in
a
dark
current
beneath
and
the
blind
the
weak
the
stupid
and
the
reckless
are
continually
falling
through
into
the
rushing
flood
we
must
it
is
true
organize
our
it
is
our
duty
to
pluck
out
the
drowning
wretches
receive
their
vows
of
penitence
and
gratitude
and
pray
for
courage
and
resignation
when
they
celebrate
their
rescue
by
falling
in
again
but
we
agree
nowadays
that
we
should
do
them
much
better
service
if
we
could
contrive
to
mend
more
of
the
holes
in
the
bridge
the
kindergarten
is
trying
to
mend
one
of
these
holes
it
is
a
tiny
one
only
large
enough
for
a
child
foot
but
that
is
our
bit
of
the
world
work
to
it
small
if
we
can
prevent
the
little
people
from
stumbling
we
may
hope
that
the
grown
folks
will
have
a
surer
foot
and
a
steadier
gait
a
wealthy
lady
announced
her
intention
of
giving
to
some
home
for
incurables
why
cried
a
bright
kindergartner
you
give
twelve
and
a
half
thousand
to
some
home
for
and
then
your
other
twelve
and
a
half
will
go
so
much
further
in
a
word
solicitude
for
childhood
is
one
of
the
signs
of
a
growing
civilization
to
cure
is
the
voice
of
the
past
to
prevent
the
divine
whisper
of
what
is
the
true
relation
of
the
kindergarten
to
social
reform
evidently
it
can
have
no
other
relation
than
that
which
grows
out
of
its
existence
as
a
plan
of
education
education
we
have
all
glibly
agreed
lessens
the
prevalence
of
crime
that
sounds
very
well
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
our
past
system
produced
all
the
results
in
this
direction
that
we
have
hoped
and
prayed
for
the
truth
is
people
will
not
be
made
much
better
by
education
until
the
plan
of
educating
them
is
made
better
to
begin
with
froebel
idea
the
kindergarten
idea
of
the
child
and
its
powers
of
humanity
and
its
destiny
of
the
universe
of
the
whole
problem
of
living
is
somewhat
different
from
that
held
by
the
vast
majority
of
parents
and
teachers
it
is
imperfectly
carried
out
even
in
the
kindergarten
itself
where
a
conscious
effort
is
made
and
is
infrequently
attempted
in
the
school
or
family
his
plan
of
education
covers
the
entire
period
between
the
nursery
and
the
university
and
contains
certain
essential
features
which
bear
close
relation
to
the
gravest
problems
of
the
day
if
they
could
be
made
an
integral
part
of
all
our
teaching
in
families
schools
and
institutions
the
burdens
under
which
society
is
groaning
would
fall
more
and
more
lightly
on
each
succeeding
generation
these
essential
features
have
often
been
enumerated
i
am
no
fortunate
herald
of
new
truth
i
may
not
even
put
the
old
wine
in
new
bottles
but
iteration
is
next
to
inspiration
and
i
shall
give
you
the
result
of
eleven
years
experience
among
the
children
and
homes
of
the
poorer
classes
this
experience
has
not
been
confined
to
teaching
one
does
not
live
among
these
people
day
after
day
pleading
for
a
welcome
for
babies
standing
beside
tiny
graves
receiving
pathetic
confidences
from
wretched
fathers
and
helpless
mothers
without
facing
every
problem
of
this
workaday
world
they
can
not
all
be
solved
even
by
the
wisest
of
us
we
can
only
seize
the
end
of
the
skein
nearest
to
our
hand
and
patiently
endeavor
to
straighten
the
tangled
threads
the
kindergarten
starts
out
plainly
with
the
assumption
that
the
moral
aim
in
education
is
the
absolute
one
and
that
all
others
are
purely
relative
it
endeavors
to
be
a
where
all
the
practices
of
complete
living
are
made
a
matter
of
daily
habit
it
asserts
boldly
that
doing
right
would
not
be
such
an
enormously
difficult
matter
if
we
practiced
it
a
little
say
a
tenth
as
much
as
we
practice
the
piano
and
it
intends
to
give
children
plenty
of
opportunity
for
practice
in
this
direction
it
says
insistently
and
eternally
do
noble
things
not
dream
them
all
day
long
for
development
action
is
the
indispensable
requisite
to
develop
moral
feeling
and
the
power
and
habit
of
moral
doing
we
must
exercise
them
excite
encourage
and
guide
their
action
to
check
reprove
and
punish
wrong
feeling
and
doing
however
necessary
it
be
for
the
safety
and
harmony
nay
for
the
very
existence
of
any
social
state
does
not
develop
right
feeling
and
good
doing
it
does
not
develop
anything
for
it
stops
action
and
without
action
there
is
no
development
at
best
it
stops
wrong
development
that
is
all
in
the
kindergarten
the
physical
mental
and
spiritual
being
is
consciously
addressed
at
one
and
the
same
time
there
is
no
tolerated
the
child
is
viewed
in
his
threefold
relations
as
the
child
of
nature
the
child
of
man
and
the
child
of
god
there
is
to
be
no
disregarding
any
one
of
these
divinely
appointed
relations
it
endeavors
with
equal
solicitude
to
instill
correct
and
logical
habits
of
thought
true
and
generous
habits
of
feeling
and
pure
and
lofty
habits
of
action
and
it
asserts
serenely
that
if
information
can
not
be
gained
in
the
right
way
it
would
better
not
be
gained
at
all
it
has
no
special
hobby
unless
you
would
call
its
eternal
plea
for
the
development
of
the
child
a
hobby
somebody
said
lately
that
the
kindergarten
people
had
a
certain
stock
of
metaphysical
statements
to
be
aired
on
every
occasion
and
that
they
were
of
prating
about
the
being
of
the
child
it
would
hardly
seem
as
if
too
much
could
be
said
in
favor
of
the
symmetrical
growth
of
the
child
nature
these
are
not
mere
silken
phrases
but
if
any
one
dislikes
them
let
him
take
the
good
honest
ringing
charge
of
colonel
parker
remember
that
the
whole
boy
goes
to
school
yes
the
whole
boy
does
go
to
school
but
the
whole
boy
is
seldom
educated
after
he
gets
there
a
fraction
of
him
is
attended
to
in
the
evening
however
and
a
fraction
on
sunday
he
takes
himself
in
hand
on
saturdays
and
in
vacation
time
and
accomplishes
a
good
deal
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
his
sight
is
a
trifle
impaired
already
and
his
hearing
grown
a
little
dull
so
that
dame
nature
works
at
a
disadvantage
and
begins
doubtless
to
dread
boys
who
have
enjoyed
too
much
schooling
since
it
seems
to
leave
them
in
a
state
of
coma
our
general
scheme
of
education
furthers
mental
development
with
considerable
success
the
training
of
the
hand
is
now
being
laboriously
woven
into
it
but
even
when
that
is
accomplished
we
shall
still
be
working
with
imperfect
aims
for
the
stress
laid
upon
is
as
yet
in
no
way
commensurate
with
its
gravity
we
know
with
that
indolent
fruitless
that
passes
for
knowing
that
out
of
the
heart
are
the
issues
of
life
we
feel
not
with
the
white
heat
of
absolute
conviction
but
placidly
and
indifferently
as
becomes
the
dwellers
in
a
world
of
change
that
conduct
is
three
fourths
of
life
but
we
do
not
crystallize
this
belief
into
action
we
dream
not
do
the
noble
things
the
kindergarten
does
not
fence
off
a
half
hour
each
day
for
moral
culture
but
keeps
it
in
view
every
moment
of
every
day
yet
it
is
never
obtrusive
for
the
mental
faculties
are
being
addressed
at
the
same
time
and
the
body
strengthened
for
its
special
work
with
the
methods
generally
practiced
in
the
family
and
school
i
fail
to
see
how
we
can
expect
any
more
delicate
sense
of
right
and
wrong
any
clearer
realization
of
duty
any
greater
enlightenment
of
conscience
any
higher
conception
of
truth
than
we
now
find
in
the
world
i
care
not
what
view
you
take
of
humanity
whether
you
have
calvinistic
tendencies
and
believe
in
the
total
depravity
of
infants
or
whether
you
are
a
disciple
of
wordsworth
and
apostrophize
the
child
as
a
mighty
prophet
seer
blest
on
whom
those
truths
do
rest
which
we
are
toiling
all
our
lives
to
find
if
you
are
a
man
or
woman
and
have
had
much
experience
with
young
children
you
will
be
compelled
to
confess
that
they
generally
have
a
tolerably
clear
sense
of
right
and
wrong
needing
only
gentle
guidance
to
choose
the
right
when
it
is
put
before
them
i
say
most
not
all
children
for
some
are
poor
blurred
human
scrawls
blotted
all
over
with
the
mistakes
of
other
people
and
how
do
we
treat
this
natural
sense
of
what
is
true
and
good
this
willingness
to
choose
good
rather
than
evil
if
it
is
made
even
the
least
bit
comprehensible
and
attractive
in
various
ways
all
equally
dull
blind
and
vicious
if
we
look
at
the
downright
ethical
significance
of
the
methods
of
training
and
discipline
in
many
families
and
schools
we
see
that
they
are
positively
degrading
we
appoint
more
and
more
monitors
instead
of
training
the
inward
monitor
in
each
child
make
difficult
instead
of
easy
punish
trivial
and
grave
offenses
about
in
the
same
way
practice
open
bribery
by
promising
children
a
few
cents
a
day
to
behave
themselves
and
weaken
their
sense
of
right
by
giving
them
picture
cards
for
telling
the
truth
and
credits
for
doing
the
most
obvious
duty
this
has
been
carried
on
until
we
are
on
the
point
of
needing
another
deluge
and
a
new
start
is
it
strange
that
we
find
the
moral
sense
blunted
the
conscience
unenlightened
the
moral
climate
with
which
we
surround
the
child
is
so
hazy
that
the
spiritual
vision
grows
dimmer
and
dimmer
and
small
wonder
upon
this
solid
mass
of
ignorance
and
stupidity
it
is
difficult
to
make
any
impression
yet
i
suppose
there
is
greater
joy
in
heaven
over
a
cordial
thwack
at
it
than
over
most
blows
at
existing
evils
the
kindergarten
attempts
a
rational
respectful
treatment
of
children
leading
them
to
do
right
as
much
as
possible
for
sake
abjuring
all
rewards
save
the
pleasure
of
working
for
others
and
the
delight
that
follows
a
good
action
and
all
punishments
save
those
that
follow
as
natural
penalties
of
broken
laws
the
obvious
consequences
of
the
special
bit
of
whatever
it
may
be
the
child
will
is
addressed
in
such
a
way
as
to
draw
it
on
if
right
to
turn
it
willingly
if
wrong
coercion
in
the
sense
of
fear
personal
magnetism
nay
even
the
child
love
for
the
teacher
may
be
used
in
such
a
way
as
to
weaken
his
moral
force
with
every
free
conscious
choice
of
right
a
human
being
moral
power
and
strength
of
character
increase
and
the
converse
of
this
is
equally
true
if
the
child
is
unruly
in
play
he
leaves
the
circle
and
sits
or
stands
by
himself
a
miserable
lonely
unit
until
he
feels
again
in
sympathy
with
the
community
if
he
destroys
his
work
he
unites
the
tattered
fragments
as
best
he
may
and
takes
the
moral
object
lesson
home
with
him
if
he
has
neglected
his
own
work
he
is
not
given
the
joy
of
working
for
others
if
he
does
not
work
in
harmony
with
his
companions
a
time
is
chosen
when
he
will
feel
the
sense
of
isolation
that
comes
from
not
living
in
unity
with
the
prevailing
spirit
of
good
will
he
can
have
as
much
liberty
as
is
consistent
with
the
liberty
of
other
people
but
no
more
if
we
could
infuse
the
of
this
kind
of
discipline
into
family
and
school
life
making
it
systematic
and
continuous
from
the
earliest
years
there
would
be
fewer
morally
little
creatures
growing
up
into
inefficient
bloodless
manhood
and
womanhood
it
would
be
a
good
deal
of
trouble
but
then
life
is
a
good
deal
of
trouble
anyway
if
you
come
to
that
we
can
not
expect
to
swallow
the
universe
like
a
pill
and
travel
on
through
the
world
like
smiling
images
pushed
from
behind
blind
obedience
to
authority
is
not
in
itself
moral
it
is
necessary
as
a
part
of
government
it
is
necessary
in
order
that
we
may
save
children
dangers
of
which
they
know
nothing
it
is
valuable
also
as
a
habit
but
i
should
never
try
to
teach
it
by
the
story
of
that
inspired
idiot
the
boy
who
stood
on
the
burning
deck
whence
all
but
him
had
fled
and
from
whence
he
would
have
fled
if
his
mental
endowment
had
been
that
of
ordinary
boys
for
obedience
must
not
be
allowed
to
destroy
common
sense
and
the
feeling
of
personal
responsibility
for
one
own
actions
our
task
is
to
train
responsible
agents
not
to
make
soldiers
virtue
thrives
in
a
bracing
moral
atmosphere
where
good
actions
are
taken
rather
as
a
matter
of
course
the
attempt
to
instill
an
idea
of
into
the
tiny
slips
of
humanity
that
find
their
way
into
the
kindergarten
is
useful
and
infinitely
to
be
preferred
to
the
most
implicit
obedience
to
arbitrary
command
in
the
one
case
we
may
hope
to
have
some
time
or
other
an
enlightened
will
and
conscience
struggling
after
the
right
failing
often
but
rising
superior
to
failure
because
of
an
ever
stronger
joy
in
right
and
shame
for
wrong
in
the
other
we
have
a
who
does
the
right
for
the
picture
card
that
is
set
before
him
a
trained
dog
sort
of
child
who
will
not
leap
through
the
hoop
unless
he
sees
the
whip
or
the
lump
of
sugar
so
much
for
the
training
of
the
sense
of
right
and
wrong
now
for
the
provision
which
the
kindergarten
makes
for
the
growth
of
certain
practical
virtues
much
needed
in
the
world
but
touched
upon
all
too
lightly
in
family
and
school
the
student
of
political
economy
sees
clearly
enough
the
need
of
greater
thrift
and
frugality
in
the
nation
but
where
and
when
do
we
propose
to
develop
these
virtues
precious
little
time
is
given
to
them
in
most
schools
for
their
cultivation
does
not
yet
seem
to
be
insisted
upon
as
an
integral
part
of
the
scheme
here
and
there
an
inspired
human
being
seizes
on
the
thought
that
the
child
should
really
be
taught
how
to
live
at
some
time
between
the
ages
of
six
and
sixteen
or
he
may
not
learn
so
easily
afterward
accordingly
the
pupils
under
the
guidance
of
that
particular
person
catch
a
glimpse
of
eternal
verities
between
the
printed
lines
of
their
geographies
and
grammars
the
kindergarten
makes
the
growth
of
virtues
so
simple
so
gradual
even
so
easy
that
you
are
almost
beguiled
into
thinking
them
commonplace
they
seem
to
come
in
just
by
the
way
as
it
were
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
have
seen
thought
and
word
and
deed
so
sweetly
mingled
that
you
marvel
at
the
universal
dovetailedness
of
things
as
dickens
puts
it
they
will
flourish
better
in
the
school
too
when
the
cheerful
hum
of
labor
is
heard
there
for
a
little
while
each
day
the
kindergarten
child
has
just
enough
strips
for
his
weaving
mat
none
to
lose
none
to
destroy
just
enough
blocks
in
each
of
his
boxes
and
every
one
of
them
he
finds
is
required
to
build
each
simple
form
he
cuts
his
square
of
paper
into
a
dozen
bits
and
behold
each
one
of
these
tiny
flakes
is
needed
to
make
a
symmetrical
figure
he
has
been
careless
in
following
directions
and
his
form
of
folded
paper
does
not
come
out
right
it
is
not
even
and
it
is
not
beautiful
the
false
step
in
the
beginning
has
perpetuated
itself
in
each
succeeding
one
until
at
the
end
either
partial
success
or
complete
failure
meets
his
eye
how
easy
here
to
see
the
relation
of
cause
to
effect
courage
says
the
kindergartner
better
fortune
next
time
for
we
will
take
greater
pains
can
you
rub
out
the
ugly
wrong
creases
we
will
try
alas
no
wrong
things
are
not
so
easily
rubbed
out
are
they
use
your
worsted
quite
to
the
end
dear
it
costs
money
let
us
save
all
the
crumbs
from
our
lunch
for
the
birds
children
do
not
drop
any
on
the
floor
it
will
only
make
work
for
somebody
else
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
the
busy
happy
day
how
easy
it
is
in
the
kindergarten
how
seemingly
difficult
later
on
it
seems
to
be
only
books
afterward
and
books
are
good
enough
in
their
own
way
but
they
are
a
mighty
bloodless
substitute
for
life
the
most
superficial
observer
values
the
industrial
side
of
the
kindergarten
because
it
falls
directly
in
line
with
the
present
effort
to
make
some
manual
training
a
part
of
school
work
but
twenty
or
years
ago
when
the
subject
was
not
so
popular
kindergarten
children
were
working
away
at
their
pretty
useful
tasks
tiny
missionaries
helping
to
show
the
way
to
a
truth
now
fully
recognized
as
to
the
value
of
leading
children
to
habits
of
industry
as
early
in
life
as
may
be
that
they
may
see
the
dignity
and
nobleness
of
labor
and
conceive
of
their
individual
responsibilities
in
this
world
of
action
that
is
too
obvious
to
dwell
upon
at
this
time
to
froebel
life
action
and
knowledge
were
the
three
notes
of
one
harmonious
chord
but
he
did
not
advocate
manual
training
merely
that
children
might
be
kept
busy
nor
even
that
technical
skill
might
be
acquired
the
piece
of
finished
kindergarten
work
is
only
a
symbol
of
something
more
valuable
which
the
child
has
acquired
in
doing
it
the
first
steps
in
all
the
kindergarten
occupations
are
directed
or
suggested
by
the
teacher
but
these
dictations
or
suggestions
are
merely
intended
to
serve
as
a
sort
of
staff
by
which
the
child
can
steady
himself
until
he
can
walk
alone
it
is
always
the
creative
instinct
that
is
to
be
reached
and
vivified
everything
else
is
secondary
by
reproduction
from
memory
of
a
dictated
form
by
taking
from
or
adding
to
it
by
changing
its
centre
corners
or
sides
by
a
dozen
ingenious
preliminary
steps
the
child
inventive
faculty
is
developed
and
he
soon
reaches
a
point
in
drawing
building
modeling
or
what
not
where
his
greatest
delight
is
to
put
his
individual
ideas
into
visible
shape
the
simple
request
make
something
pretty
of
your
own
brings
a
score
of
original
combinations
and
designs
either
the
old
thoughts
in
different
shape
or
something
fresh
and
audacious
which
hints
of
genius
instead
of
twenty
hackneyed
and
slavish
copies
of
one
pattern
we
have
twenty
free
individual
productions
each
the
expression
of
the
child
inmost
personal
thought
this
invests
labor
with
a
beauty
and
power
and
confers
upon
it
a
dignity
to
be
gained
in
no
other
way
it
makes
every
task
however
lowly
a
joy
because
all
the
higher
faculties
are
brought
into
action
much
busy
work
where
pupils
of
the
a
class
are
allowed
to
stick
a
thousand
pegs
in
a
thousand
holes
while
the
b
class
is
reciting
arithmetic
is
quite
fruitless
because
it
has
so
little
thought
behind
it
unless
we
have
a
care
manual
training
when
we
have
succeeded
in
getting
it
into
the
school
may
become
as
mechanical
and
unprofitable
as
much
of
our
mind
training
has
been
and
its
moral
value
thus
largely
missed
the
only
way
to
prevent
it
is
to
borrow
a
suggestion
from
froebel
then
and
only
then
shall
we
have
insight
with
power
of
action
knowledge
with
practice
practice
with
the
stamp
of
individuality
then
doing
will
blossom
into
being
and
being
is
the
mother
of
all
the
little
doings
as
well
as
of
the
deeds
and
heroic
sacrifices
the
kindergarten
succeeds
in
getting
these
interesting
and
valuable
free
productions
from
children
of
four
or
five
years
only
by
developing
in
every
possible
way
the
sense
of
beauty
and
harmony
and
order
we
know
that
people
assume
somewhat
at
least
the
color
of
their
surroundings
and
if
the
sense
of
beauty
is
to
grow
we
must
give
it
something
to
feed
upon
the
kindergarten
tries
to
provide
a
room
more
or
less
attractive
quantities
of
pictures
and
objects
of
interest
growing
plants
and
vines
vases
of
flowers
and
plenty
of
light
air
and
sunshine
a
canary
chirps
in
one
corner
perhaps
and
very
likely
there
will
be
a
cat
curled
up
somewhere
or
a
forlorn
dog
which
has
followed
the
children
into
this
safe
shelter
it
is
a
pretty
pleasant
domestic
interior
charming
and
grateful
to
the
senses
the
kindergartner
looks
as
if
she
were
glad
to
be
there
and
the
children
are
generally
smiling
everybody
seems
alive
the
work
lying
cosily
about
is
neat
artistic
and
suggestive
the
children
pass
out
of
their
seats
to
the
cheerful
sound
of
music
and
are
presently
joining
in
an
ideal
sort
of
game
where
in
place
of
the
mawkish
sentimentality
of
sally
walker
of
obnoxious
memory
we
see
all
sorts
of
healthful
poetic
childlike
fancies
woven
into
song
rudeness
is
for
the
most
part
banished
the
little
human
butterflies
and
bees
and
birds
flit
hither
and
thither
in
the
circle
the
trees
hold
up
their
branches
and
the
flowers
their
cups
and
everybody
seems
merry
and
content
as
they
pass
out
the
door
and
bows
and
kisses
are
wafted
backward
into
the
room
for
the
manners
of
polite
society
are
observed
in
everything
you
draw
a
deep
breath
this
is
a
kindergarten
and
it
is
like
a
little
piece
of
the
millennium
everything
is
so
very
pretty
and
charming
says
the
visitor
yes
so
it
is
but
all
this
color
beauty
grace
symmetry
daintiness
delicacy
and
refinement
though
it
seems
to
address
and
develop
the
aesthetic
side
of
the
nature
has
in
reality
a
very
profound
ethical
significance
we
have
all
seen
the
preternatural
virtue
of
the
child
who
wears
her
best
dress
hat
and
shoes
on
the
same
august
occasion
children
are
tidier
and
more
careful
in
a
dainty
room
they
treat
pretty
materials
more
respectfully
than
ugly
ones
they
are
inclined
to
be
ashamed
at
least
in
a
slight
degree
of
uncleanliness
vulgarity
and
brutality
when
they
see
them
in
broad
contrast
with
beauty
and
harmony
and
order
for
the
most
part
they
try
to
live
up
to
the
place
in
which
they
find
themselves
there
is
some
connection
between
manners
and
morals
it
is
very
elusive
and
perhaps
not
very
deep
but
it
exists
vice
does
not
flourish
alike
in
all
conditions
and
localities
by
any
means
an
ignorant
negro
was
overheard
praying
let
me
so
lib
dat
when
i
die
i
may
dat
i
may
know
what
to
say
when
i
see
my
heabenly
lord
well
i
dare
say
we
shall
need
good
manners
as
well
as
good
morals
in
heaven
and
the
constant
cultivation
of
the
one
from
right
motives
might
give
us
an
unexpected
impetus
toward
the
other
if
the
systematic
development
of
the
sense
of
beauty
and
order
has
an
ethical
significance
so
has
the
happy
atmosphere
of
the
kindergarten
an
influence
in
the
same
direction
i
have
known
one
or
two
solid
men
and
one
or
two
predestinate
spinsters
who
said
that
they
did
believe
children
could
accomplish
anything
in
the
kindergarten
because
they
had
too
good
a
time
there
is
something
uniquely
vicious
about
people
who
care
nothing
for
children
happiness
that
sense
of
the
solemnity
of
mortal
conditions
which
has
been
indelibly
impressed
upon
us
by
our
puritan
ancestors
comes
soon
enough
heaven
knows
meanwhile
a
happy
childhood
is
an
unspeakably
precious
memory
we
look
back
upon
it
and
refresh
our
tired
hearts
with
the
vision
when
experience
has
cast
a
shadow
over
the
full
joy
of
living
the
sunshiny
atmosphere
of
a
good
kindergarten
gives
the
young
human
plants
an
impulse
toward
eager
vigorous
growth
love
warmth
surrounds
them
on
every
side
wooing
their
sweetest
possibilities
into
life
roots
take
a
firmer
grasp
buds
form
and
flowers
bloom
where
under
more
unfriendly
conditions
bare
stalks
or
pale
leaves
would
greet
the
eye
pathetic
unfulfilled
promises
souls
no
happier
for
having
lived
in
the
world
the
world
no
happier
because
of
their
living
virtue
kindles
at
the
touch
of
joy
the
kindergarten
takes
this
for
one
of
its
texts
and
does
not
breed
that
dismal
fungus
of
the
mind
which
disposes
one
to
believe
that
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
must
necessarily
be
disagreeable
the
social
phase
of
the
kindergarten
is
most
interesting
to
the
student
of
social
economics
coöperative
work
is
strongly
emphasized
and
the
child
is
inspired
both
to
live
his
life
and
yet
to
feel
that
his
life
touches
other
lives
at
every
point
for
we
are
members
one
of
another
it
is
not
the
unity
of
the
little
birds
in
the
couplet
who
agree
in
their
little
nests
because
fall
out
if
they
did
but
a
realization
in
embryo
of
the
divine
principle
that
no
man
liveth
to
himself
as
to
specifically
religious
culture
everything
fosters
the
spirit
out
of
which
true
religion
grows
in
the
morning
talks
when
the
children
are
most
susceptible
and
ready
to
be
good
as
they
say
their
thoughts
are
led
to
the
beauty
of
the
world
about
them
the
pleasure
of
right
doing
the
sweetness
of
kind
thoughts
and
actions
the
loveliness
of
truth
patience
and
helpfulness
and
the
goodness
of
the
creator
to
all
created
things
no
parent
of
whatever
creed
or
lack
of
creed
whether
a
bigot
or
unbeliever
could
object
to
the
kind
of
religious
instruction
given
in
the
kindergarten
and
yet
in
every
possible
way
the
and
the
are
directed
towards
everything
that
is
pure
and
holy
true
and
steadfast
if
the
child
love
not
his
brother
whom
he
hath
seen
how
can
he
love
god
whom
he
hath
not
seen
love
worketh
no
ill
to
his
neighbor
therefore
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
there
is
a
vast
deal
of
practical
religion
to
be
breathed
into
these
little
children
of
the
street
before
the
abstractions
of
beliefs
can
be
comprehended
they
can
not
live
on
words
and
prayers
and
texts
the
thought
and
feeling
must
come
before
the
expression
as
whitney
says
the
world
is
determined
to
vaccinate
children
with
religion
for
fear
they
should
take
it
in
the
natural
way
some
wise
sayings
of
the
good
holland
in
nicholas
minturn
come
to
me
as
i
write
nicholas
says
in
discussing
this
matter
of
charities
and
the
various
means
of
effecting
a
radical
cure
of
pauperism
rather
than
its
continual
alleviation
if
you
read
the
parable
of
the
sower
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
soil
is
quite
as
necessary
as
seed
indeed
that
the
seed
is
thrown
away
unless
a
soil
is
prepared
in
advance
i
believe
in
religion
but
before
i
undertake
to
plant
it
i
would
like
something
to
plant
it
in
the
sowers
are
too
few
and
the
seed
is
too
precious
to
be
thrown
away
and
lost
among
the
thorns
and
stones
last
but
by
no
means
least
the
admirable
physical
culture
that
goes
on
in
the
kindergarten
is
all
in
the
right
direction
physiologists
know
as
much
about
morality
as
ministers
of
the
gospel
the
vices
which
drag
men
and
women
into
crime
spring
as
often
from
unhealthy
bodies
as
from
weak
wills
and
callous
consciences
vile
fancies
and
sensual
appetites
grow
stronger
and
more
terrible
when
a
feeble
physique
and
low
vitality
offer
no
opposing
force
deadly
vices
are
nourished
in
the
weak
diseased
bodies
that
are
penned
day
after
day
in
filthy
crowded
tenements
of
great
cities
if
we
could
withdraw
every
child
from
these
physically
enfeebling
and
morally
brutalizing
influences
and
give
them
three
or
four
hours
a
day
of
sunshine
fresh
air
and
healthy
physical
exercise
we
should
be
doing
humanity
an
inestimable
service
even
if
we
attempted
nothing
more
i
have
tried
as
briefly
as
i
might
in
justice
to
the
subject
to
emphasize
the
following
points
i
that
we
must
act
up
to
our
convictions
with
regard
to
the
value
of
preventive
work
if
we
are
ever
obliged
to
choose
let
us
save
the
children
ii
that
the
relation
of
the
kindergarten
to
social
reform
is
simply
that
as
a
plan
of
education
it
offers
us
valuable
suggestions
in
regard
to
the
mental
moral
and
physical
culture
of
children
which
in
view
of
certain
crying
evils
of
the
day
we
should
do
well
to
follow
the
essential
features
of
the
kindergarten
which
bear
a
special
relation
to
the
subject
are
as
follows
the
symmetrical
development
of
the
child
powers
considering
him
neither
as
all
mind
all
soul
nor
all
body
but
as
a
creature
capable
of
devout
feeling
clear
thinking
noble
doing
the
attempt
to
make
moral
culture
a
little
less
immoral
the
rational
method
of
discipline
looking
to
the
growth
of
moral
power
in
the
child
the
only
proper
discipline
for
future
citizens
of
a
free
republic
the
development
of
certain
practical
virtues
the
lack
of
which
is
endangering
the
prosperity
of
the
nation
namely
economy
thrift
temperance
frugality
industry
courtesy
and
all
the
sober
host
none
of
them
accomplishments
and
consequently
in
small
demand
the
emphasis
placed
upon
manual
training
especially
in
its
development
of
the
child
creative
activity
the
training
of
the
sense
of
beauty
harmony
and
order
its
ethical
as
well
as
aesthetical
significance
the
insistence
upon
the
moral
effect
of
happiness
joy
the
favorable
climate
of
childhood
the
training
of
the
child
social
nature
an
attempt
to
teach
the
brotherhood
of
man
as
well
as
the
fatherhood
of
god
the
realization
that
a
healthy
body
has
almost
as
great
an
influence
on
morals
as
a
pure
mind
i
do
not
say
that
the
consistent
practice
of
these
principles
will
bring
the
millennium
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
but
i
do
affirm
that
they
are
the
of
that
better
education
which
shall
prepare
humanity
for
the
new
earth
over
which
shall
arch
the
new
heaven
ruskin
says
crime
can
only
be
truly
hindered
by
letting
no
man
grow
up
a
criminal
by
taking
away
the
will
to
commit
sin
but
you
object
that
is
sheer
impossibility
it
does
seem
so
i
confess
and
yet
unless
you
are
willing
to
think
that
the
whole
plan
of
an
omnipotent
being
is
to
be
utterly
overthrown
set
aside
thwarted
then
you
must
believe
this
ideal
possible
somehow
sometime
i
know
of
no
better
way
to
grow
towards
it
than
by
living
up
to
the
kindergarten
idea
that
just
as
we
gain
intellectual
power
by
doing
intellectual
work
and
the
finest
aesthetic
feeling
by
creating
beauty
so
shall
we
win
for
ourselves
the
power
of
feeling
nobly
and
willing
nobly
by
doing
noble
things
how
shall
we
govern
our
children
not
the
cry
says
a
chinese
author
but
the
rising
of
a
wild
duck
impels
the
flock
to
follow
him
in
upward
flight
long
ago
in
a
country
a
child
was
born
and
when
his
parents
looked
on
him
they
loved
him
and
they
resolved
in
their
simple
hearts
to
make
of
him
a
strong
brave
warlike
man
but
the
god
of
that
country
was
a
hungry
and
an
insatiable
god
and
he
cried
out
for
human
sacrifice
so
when
his
arms
had
been
thrice
heated
till
they
glowed
red
with
the
flame
of
the
fire
the
mother
cradled
her
child
in
them
and
his
life
exhaled
as
a
vapor
a
child
was
born
in
another
country
and
the
tender
eyes
of
his
mother
saw
that
his
limbs
were
misshapen
and
his
a
sickly
current
yet
her
heart
yearned
over
him
and
she
would
have
tended
and
trained
him
and
loved
him
better
than
all
the
rest
of
her
strong
brood
but
when
the
elders
of
her
people
knew
that
the
child
was
a
weakling
they
decreed
that
he
should
die
and
she
bent
her
head
to
the
law
which
was
stronger
than
her
love
in
a
third
land
a
child
was
to
be
born
and
the
proud
father
made
ready
gifts
and
purchased
silken
robes
and
prepared
a
feast
for
his
friends
but
alas
when
the
soul
entered
the
world
it
was
housed
in
a
body
and
straightway
the
joy
was
changed
into
mourning
bitter
reproaches
were
heaped
upon
the
mother
for
were
there
not
enough
women
already
on
the
earth
and
the
fiat
went
forth
that
the
babe
should
straightway
be
delivered
from
the
trials
of
existence
so
while
its
hold
on
life
was
yet
uncertain
the
mother
placed
wet
cloths
upon
its
lips
and
soon
the
faint
breath
stopped
and
the
white
soul
went
fluttering
heavenward
again
in
still
another
of
god
fair
lands
a
child
entered
the
world
and
he
grew
toward
manhood
vigorous
and
lusty
but
he
heeded
not
his
commands
and
when
his
disobedience
had
been
long
continued
the
fathers
of
the
tribe
decreed
that
he
should
be
stoned
to
death
for
so
it
was
written
in
the
sacred
books
and
as
the
youth
was
the
absolute
property
of
his
parents
and
as
by
common
consent
they
had
full
liberty
to
deal
with
him
as
seemed
good
to
them
they
consented
unto
his
death
that
his
soul
might
be
saved
alive
and
the
evening
sun
shone
crimson
on
his
dead
body
as
it
lay
upon
the
sands
of
the
desert
at
a
later
day
and
in
a
christian
country
two
children
were
born
one
hundred
years
apart
and
the
world
had
now
so
far
progressed
that
absolute
power
over
the
life
of
the
offspring
was
denied
the
parents
the
one
was
ruled
with
iron
rods
he
was
made
to
obey
with
a
rigidity
of
compliance
and
a
severity
of
treatment
in
case
of
failure
which
made
obedience
a
slavish
duty
and
he
was
taught
besides
that
he
was
a
child
of
satan
and
an
heir
of
hell
he
found
no
joy
in
his
youth
and
his
miserable
soul
groveled
in
fear
of
the
despot
who
dominated
him
and
of
the
blazing
eternity
which
he
was
told
would
be
the
punishment
for
his
sins
his
will
was
broken
he
was
made
weak
where
he
might
have
been
strong
and
he
did
evil
because
he
had
learned
no
power
of
yet
his
people
loved
him
and
they
had
done
all
these
things
because
they
wished
to
purge
him
wholly
from
all
uncleanness
the
parents
of
the
other
child
were
warned
of
the
lamentable
results
of
this
gloomy
training
and
they
said
one
to
another
our
darling
shall
be
free
as
air
his
duties
shall
be
made
to
seem
like
pleasures
or
better
still
he
shall
have
no
duty
but
his
pleasure
he
shall
do
only
what
he
wills
that
his
will
may
grow
strong
and
he
can
but
choose
the
right
for
he
knows
no
evil
we
will
hold
up
before
him
no
bugbear
of
future
punishment
for
doubtless
there
is
no
such
thing
and
if
there
be
it
will
not
be
meted
out
to
such
a
child
he
will
love
and
obey
his
parents
because
they
have
devoted
themselves
to
his
happiness
and
because
they
have
never
imposed
distasteful
obligations
upon
him
and
when
he
grows
to
manhood
he
will
be
a
model
of
wisdom
and
of
goodness
but
lo
the
child
of
this
training
was
as
great
a
failure
as
the
child
of
austerity
and
gloom
he
was
capricious
lawless
willful
disobedient
passionate
he
thought
of
no
one
pleasure
save
his
own
he
cared
for
his
parents
only
in
so
far
as
they
could
be
of
use
to
him
and
like
a
wild
beast
of
the
jungle
he
preyed
upon
the
life
around
him
and
cared
not
whom
he
destroyed
if
his
appetites
were
satisfied
in
every
field
of
opinion
and
action
men
are
found
swinging
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
of
life
manifold
arcs
of
vibration
this
perpetual
movement
may
be
the
essential
condition
of
existence
for
death
is
cessation
of
motion
or
it
may
be
a
effort
of
the
mind
to
reach
an
ideal
which
discloses
itself
so
seldom
as
to
make
its
permanent
a
matter
of
uncertainty
doubtless
there
is
somewhere
a
middle
to
the
arc
and
in
the
lapse
of
ages
the
needle
may
at
last
find
the
of
central
truth
and
be
at
rest
but
as
yet
in
every
department
of
labor
and
thought
it
is
vibrating
and
after
tarrying
a
while
at
one
extreme
it
swings
unsatisfied
back
to
the
other
nowhere
are
these
extremes
more
noticeable
than
in
the
government
of
children
centuries
ago
in
the
patriarchal
period
the
father
of
the
family
seems
also
to
have
exercised
the
functions
of
a
criminal
judge
but
the
uniting
of
the
two
sets
of
duties
in
one
person
does
not
appear
to
have
inspired
the
children
with
insurmountable
awe
for
laws
are
found
both
in
numbers
and
deuteronomy
fixing
the
penalty
of
disobedience
and
of
the
striking
of
a
parent
by
a
child
still
later
the
roman
father
possessed
arbitrary
powers
of
life
and
death
over
his
children
but
it
is
probable
that
natural
affection
and
a
more
advanced
civilization
commonly
made
the
law
a
dead
letter
though
the
world
in
time
grew
to
feel
that
life
belonged
to
the
being
who
held
it
not
to
those
who
gave
it
birth
still
discipline
has
for
ages
been
directed
more
to
the
body
than
to
the
mind
with
an
idea
apparently
that
the
pains
of
the
flesh
will
save
the
soul
pious
parents
until
within
recent
dates
have
regarded
the
flogging
of
children
as
absolutely
a
religious
obligation
and
many
a
tender
mother
has
steeled
her
heart
and
strengthened
her
arm
to
give
the
blows
which
she
regarded
as
essential
to
the
spiritual
of
her
child
the
birch
rod
and
the
bible
were
the
parents
complete
guide
to
domestic
management
in
puritan
days
and
no
one
can
deny
that
this
treatment
though
rather
a
heroic
one
seems
to
have
produced
fine
strong
men
and
women
governor
bradford
in
speaks
feelingly
of
the
godliness
of
a
puritan
woman
whose
office
it
was
to
sit
in
a
convenient
place
in
the
congregation
with
a
little
birchen
rod
in
her
hand
and
keep
the
children
in
great
awe
and
from
the
frequency
with
which
chastisement
is
mentioned
in
early
puritan
records
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
the
sober
little
lads
and
lasses
of
the
day
did
not
suffer
from
when
this
wholesale
whipping
began
to
fall
into
disuse
many
philosophers
prophesied
the
ruin
of
the
race
but
these
gloomy
predictions
have
scarcely
found
their
fulfillment
as
yet
there
has
been
however
a
colossal
change
in
discipline
from
the
days
when
disobedience
was
punishable
with
death
to
the
agreeable
moral
suasion
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
exemplified
in
the
fin
de
siècle
nonsense
rhyme
there
once
was
a
hopeful
young
horse
who
was
brought
up
on
love
without
force
he
had
his
own
way
and
they
sugared
his
hay
so
he
never
was
naughty
of
course
the
results
of
this
delightful
method
of
treatment
seem
rather
problematic
and
the
modern
child
is
universally
acknowledged
to
be
no
improvement
upon
his
predecessors
in
point
of
respect
and
filial
piety
at
least
a
superintendent
report
written
thirty
years
ago
for
one
of
the
new
england
states
regrets
that
even
then
home
government
had
grown
lax
he
wittily
says
that
young
america
is
parental
influence
and
no
reversal
of
these
positions
is
as
yet
visible
in
to
those
who
note
the
methods
by
which
many
children
are
managed
it
is
a
matter
of
wonderment
that
the
results
in
character
and
conduct
are
not
very
much
worse
than
they
are
channing
wisely
says
the
hope
of
the
world
lies
in
the
fact
that
parents
can
not
make
of
their
children
what
they
will
happy
accidents
of
association
and
circumstance
sometimes
nullify
the
harm
the
parent
has
done
and
the
tremendous
momentum
of
the
carries
the
child
over
many
an
obstacle
which
his
training
has
set
in
his
path
it
seems
at
the
outset
that
you
can
not
govern
a
child
if
you
have
never
learned
to
govern
yourself
plato
said
many
centuries
ago
the
best
way
of
training
the
young
is
to
train
yourself
at
the
same
time
not
to
admonish
them
but
to
be
always
carrying
out
your
own
principles
in
practice
and
all
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
is
in
the
thought
if
then
you
are
a
fit
person
to
be
trusted
with
the
government
of
a
child
what
goal
do
you
propose
to
reach
in
your
discipline
what
is
your
aim
your
ideal
the
discipline
should
be
thoroughly
in
harmony
with
in
general
and
suited
to
the
age
and
development
of
the
particular
child
in
question
it
should
appeal
to
the
higher
motives
and
to
the
higher
motives
alone
it
should
develop
kindness
helpfulness
and
sympathy
it
should
never
use
weapons
which
would
tend
to
lower
the
it
should
be
thoroughly
just
and
the
punishment
or
rather
the
retribution
should
be
commensurate
with
the
offense
it
should
teach
respect
for
law
and
for
the
rights
of
others
finally
it
should
teach
voluntary
obedience
the
last
lesson
in
life
the
choral
song
which
rises
from
all
elements
and
all
angels
and
as
the
object
of
true
discipline
is
the
formation
of
character
it
should
produce
a
human
being
master
of
his
impulses
his
passions
and
his
will
the
journey
end
being
fixed
one
must
next
decide
what
route
will
reach
it
and
will
be
short
safe
economical
and
desirable
and
the
roads
to
the
presumably
ideal
discipline
are
many
and
some
of
them
it
is
true
lead
you
into
a
swamp
some
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
some
will
hurl
you
down
a
with
terrific
rapidity
others
stop
bringing
you
face
to
face
with
a
blank
wall
and
others
again
will
lose
you
entirely
on
a
bleak
and
trackless
plain
but
no
matter
which
route
you
select
you
will
have
the
wise
company
of
a
great
many
teachers
parents
and
guardians
and
an
innumerable
throng
of
fair
and
lovely
children
will
journey
by
your
side
the
road
of
threat
and
fear
of
arbitrary
and
punishment
has
been
much
traveled
in
all
times
though
perhaps
it
is
a
little
now
the
child
who
obeys
you
merely
because
he
fears
punishment
is
a
slave
who
cowers
under
the
lash
of
the
despot
undue
severity
makes
him
a
liar
and
a
coward
he
hates
his
master
he
hates
the
thing
he
is
made
to
do
there
is
a
bitter
sense
of
injustice
a
seething
passion
of
revenge
forever
within
him
and
were
he
strong
enough
he
would
rise
and
destroy
the
power
that
has
crushed
him
he
has
done
right
because
he
was
forced
to
do
so
not
because
he
desired
it
and
since
the
the
obedience
was
neither
the
fruit
of
his
reason
nor
his
love
it
can
not
be
permanent
the
feeling
of
justice
is
strong
in
the
child
mind
and
you
have
constantly
wounded
that
feeling
you
have
destroyed
the
sense
of
cause
and
effect
by
your
arbitrary
punishments
you
have
corrected
him
for
disobedience
for
carelessness
for
unkindness
for
untruthfulness
for
noisiness
and
for
slowness
in
learning
his
lessons
how
is
he
to
know
which
of
these
offenses
is
the
greatest
if
all
have
received
the
same
punishment
why
should
giving
him
a
good
thrashing
teach
him
to
be
kind
to
his
little
sister
why
should
he
learn
the
multiplication
table
with
greater
rapidity
because
you
ferule
him
soundly
have
you
ever
found
pain
an
assistance
to
the
memory
if
he
has
little
intellectual
perception
of
the
difference
between
truth
and
falsehood
why
should
you
suppose
that
smart
strokes
on
any
portion
of
the
body
would
quicken
that
perception
is
it
not
clear
as
the
sun
at
noonday
that
since
he
observes
the
punishment
to
have
no
necessary
relation
to
the
offense
and
since
he
observes
it
to
be
light
or
severe
according
to
your
pleasure
is
it
not
clear
that
he
will
suppose
you
to
be
using
your
superior
strength
in
order
to
treat
him
unfairly
and
will
not
the
supposition
sow
seeds
of
hatred
and
rebellion
in
his
heart
another
road
to
discipline
is
that
of
bribery
to
endeavor
to
secure
goodness
in
a
child
by
means
of
bribery
to
promise
him
a
reward
in
case
he
obeys
you
is
manifestly
an
absurdity
you
are
destroying
the
very
traits
in
his
character
you
are
presumably
endeavoring
to
build
up
you
are
educating
a
human
being
who
knows
good
from
evil
and
who
should
be
taught
deliberately
to
choose
the
right
for
the
right
sake
who
should
do
his
duty
because
he
knows
it
to
be
his
duty
not
for
any
extraneous
reward
connected
with
it
a
spiritual
reward
will
follow
nevertheless
in
the
feeling
of
happiness
engendered
and
the
child
may
early
be
led
to
find
his
satisfaction
in
this
and
in
the
approval
of
those
he
loves
there
are
of
course
certain
simple
rewards
which
can
be
used
with
safety
and
which
the
child
easily
sees
to
be
the
natural
results
of
good
conduct
if
his
treatment
of
the
household
pussy
has
been
kind
and
gentle
he
may
well
be
trusted
with
a
pet
of
his
own
if
he
puts
his
toys
away
carefully
when
asked
to
do
so
father
will
notice
the
neat
room
when
he
comes
home
if
he
learns
his
lessons
well
and
quickly
he
will
have
the
more
time
to
work
in
the
garden
and
the
suggestion
of
these
natural
consequences
is
legitimate
and
of
good
effect
it
is
always
safer
no
doubt
to
appeal
to
a
love
of
pleasure
in
children
than
to
a
fear
of
pain
yet
bribes
and
extraneous
rewards
inevitably
breed
selfishness
and
corruption
and
lead
the
child
to
expect
conditions
in
life
which
will
never
be
realized
though
retribution
of
one
kind
or
another
follows
quickly
on
the
heels
of
yet
virtue
is
commonly
its
own
reward
and
it
is
as
well
that
the
child
should
learn
this
at
the
beginning
of
life
froebel
says
does
a
simple
natural
child
when
acting
rightly
think
of
any
other
reward
which
he
might
receive
for
his
action
than
this
consciousness
though
that
reward
be
only
praise
how
we
degrade
and
lower
the
human
nature
which
we
should
raise
how
we
weaken
those
whom
we
should
strengthen
when
we
hold
up
to
them
an
inducement
to
act
virtuously
emulation
is
often
harnessed
into
service
to
further
intellectual
progress
and
the
formation
of
right
habits
of
conduct
and
this
inevitably
breeds
serious
evils
it
is
well
to
set
before
the
child
an
ideal
on
which
he
may
form
himself
as
far
as
possible
but
when
this
ideal
sits
across
the
aisle
plays
in
a
neighboring
back
yard
or
worse
still
is
another
child
in
the
same
family
he
is
hated
and
despised
his
virtues
become
obnoxious
and
the
unfortunate
evildoer
prefers
to
be
vicious
that
he
may
not
resemble
a
creature
whose
praises
have
so
continually
been
sung
that
his
very
name
is
odious
if
the
child
grows
accustomed
to
the
comparison
of
himself
with
others
and
the
endeavor
to
excel
them
he
becomes
selfish
envious
and
either
vain
of
his
virtue
and
attainments
or
else
thoroughly
disheartened
at
his
small
success
while
he
grudges
that
of
his
neighbor
george
macdonald
says
no
work
noble
or
lastingly
good
can
come
of
emulation
any
more
than
of
greed
i
think
the
motives
are
spiritually
the
same
to
what
can
we
appeal
then
in
children
as
motives
to
goodness
as
aids
in
the
formation
of
right
habits
of
thought
and
action
ah
the
child
heart
is
a
harp
of
many
strings
and
touched
by
the
hand
of
a
master
a
fine
clear
tone
will
sound
from
every
one
of
them
while
the
resultant
strain
will
be
a
triumphant
burst
of
glorious
harmony
touch
delicately
the
string
of
love
of
approval
and
listen
to
the
answer
the
child
delights
to
work
for
you
to
please
you
if
he
can
to
do
his
tasks
well
enough
to
win
your
favorable
notice
and
the
breath
of
praise
is
sweet
to
his
nostrils
it
is
right
and
justifiable
that
he
should
have
this
praise
and
it
will
be
an
aid
to
his
spiritual
development
if
bestowed
with
discrimination
only
titanic
strength
of
character
can
endure
constant
discouragement
and
failure
and
yet
work
steadily
onward
and
the
weak
undeveloped
human
being
needs
a
word
of
approval
now
and
then
to
show
him
that
he
is
on
the
right
track
and
that
his
efforts
are
appreciated
of
course
the
kind
and
the
frequency
of
the
praise
bestowed
depend
entirely
upon
the
nature
of
the
child
one
timid
temperament
needs
frequently
to
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
your
approval
while
another
somewhat
predisposed
to
vanity
and
feeds
a
more
bracing
moral
climate
there
is
no
question
that
cleanliness
and
fresh
air
may
be
considered
as
minor
aids
to
goodness
and
a
dangerous
outbreak
of
insubordination
may
sometimes
be
averted
by
hastily
suggesting
to
the
little
rebel
a
run
in
the
garden
prefaced
by
a
thorough
application
of
cool
water
to
the
flushed
face
and
little
clenched
hands
while
may
often
be
restored
by
the
donning
of
a
clean
apron
beauty
of
surroundings
is
another
incentive
to
harmony
of
action
it
is
easier
for
the
child
to
be
naughty
in
a
poor
gloomy
room
scanty
of
furniture
than
in
a
garden
gay
with
flowers
shaded
by
trees
and
made
musical
by
the
voice
of
running
water
william
harris
says
beauty
can
not
create
a
new
heart
but
it
can
greatly
change
the
disposition
and
this
seems
unquestionable
especially
with
regard
to
the
glory
of
god
handiwork
which
makes
goodness
seem
the
natural
way
of
living
yet
we
would
not
wish
our
children
to
be
sybarites
and
we
must
endeavor
to
cultivate
in
their
breasts
a
hardy
plant
of
virtue
which
will
live
if
need
be
on
alpine
heights
and
feed
on
scanty
fare
it
is
a
truism
that
interesting
occupation
prevents
dissension
and
that
idle
fingers
are
the
devil
tools
a
child
who
is
good
and
happy
during
school
time
with
its
regular
hours
and
alternated
work
and
play
often
becomes
in
vacation
fretful
sulky
discontented
and
in
arms
against
the
entire
world
the
discipline
of
work
if
of
a
proper
kind
of
a
kind
in
which
success
is
not
too
long
delayed
is
sure
and
efficacious
success
if
the
fruit
of
one
own
efforts
is
so
sweet
that
one
longs
for
more
of
the
work
which
produced
it
the
reverse
of
the
medal
may
be
seen
here
also
the
knotted
thread
which
breaks
if
pulled
too
impatiently
the
dropped
stitches
that
make
rough
uneven
places
in
the
pattern
the
sail
which
was
wrongly
placed
and
will
not
propel
the
boat
the
pile
of
withered
leaves
which
was
not
removed
and
which
the
wind
scattered
over
the
garden
are
not
all
these
concrete
moral
lessons
in
patience
accuracy
and
carefulness
we
may
safely
appeal
to
public
opinion
sometimes
in
dealing
with
children
the
chief
object
in
doing
this
is
to
create
a
constantly
advancing
ideal
toward
which
the
child
is
attracted
and
thereby
to
gain
a
constantly
increasing
effort
on
his
part
to
realize
this
ideal
there
comes
a
time
in
the
child
development
when
he
begins
to
realize
his
own
individuality
and
longs
to
see
it
recognized
by
others
the
views
of
life
the
sentiments
of
the
people
about
him
are
clearly
noted
and
he
desires
to
so
shape
his
conduct
as
to
be
in
harmony
with
them
if
he
sees
that
and
cowardice
are
looked
upon
with
disgust
by
his
comrades
he
will
be
a
very
spartan
in
his
laconicism
and
courage
if
his
father
and
older
brothers
can
bear
pain
without
wincing
then
he
will
not
cry
when
he
hurts
himself
oftentimes
he
is
obdurate
when
reproved
in
private
for
a
fault
but
when
brought
to
the
tribunal
of
the
disapproval
of
other
children
he
is
chagrined
repents
and
makes
atonement
he
is
uneasy
under
the
adverse
verdict
of
a
large
company
but
the
condemnation
of
one
person
did
not
weigh
with
him
it
is
usually
not
wise
however
to
appeal
to
public
opinion
in
this
way
save
on
an
abstract
question
as
the
child
loses
his
and
becomes
degraded
in
his
own
eyes
if
his
fault
is
trumpeted
abroad
stories
of
brave
deeds
poems
of
heroism
and
loyalty
have
their
places
in
creating
a
sentiment
of
ideality
in
the
breast
a
sentiment
which
remains
fixed
sometimes
even
though
it
be
not
in
harmony
with
the
feeling
of
the
majority
now
and
then
some
noble
soul
is
born
some
hero
so
thrilled
with
the
ideal
that
he
rises
far
above
the
public
sentiment
of
his
day
but
usually
we
count
him
great
who
overtops
his
fellows
by
an
inch
or
two
and
he
who
falls
much
below
the
level
of
ordinary
feeling
is
esteemed
as
almost
beyond
hope
to
seek
for
the
approval
of
others
even
though
they
embody
our
highest
ideals
is
truly
not
the
loftiest
form
of
aspiration
but
it
is
one
round
in
the
ladder
which
leads
to
that
higher
feeling
the
desire
for
the
benediction
of
the
within
us
although
discipline
by
means
of
fear
as
the
word
is
commonly
used
can
not
be
too
strongly
condemned
yet
there
is
a
godly
fear
of
which
the
bible
speaks
which
certainly
has
its
place
among
incentives
in
the
child
has
not
attained
as
yet
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
we
ourselves
have
done
so
to
that
supreme
excellence
of
love
which
absolutely
casteth
out
fear
a
writer
of
great
moral
insight
says
has
not
the
law
of
seed
and
flower
cause
and
effect
the
law
of
continuity
which
binds
the
universe
together
a
tone
of
severity
it
has
surely
like
all
righteous
law
and
carries
with
it
a
legitimate
and
wholesome
fear
if
we
are
to
reap
what
we
have
sown
some
perhaps
most
of
us
may
dread
the
harvest
the
child
shrinks
from
the
disapproval
of
the
loved
parent
or
teacher
by
so
much
the
more
as
he
reverences
and
respects
those
in
authority
over
him
does
he
dread
to
do
that
which
he
knows
they
would
condemn
if
he
has
been
led
to
expect
natural
retributions
he
will
have
a
wholesome
fear
of
putting
his
hand
in
the
fire
since
he
knows
the
inevitable
consequences
he
understands
that
it
is
folly
to
expect
that
wrong
can
be
done
with
impunity
and
shrinks
in
terror
from
committing
a
sin
whose
consequences
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
escape
he
knows
well
that
there
are
other
punishments
save
those
of
the
body
and
he
has
felt
the
anguish
which
follows
there
is
nothing
degrading
in
such
fear
but
a
reverence
and
awe
in
the
sincere
and
humble
conviction
that
god
law
is
everywhere
such
are
some
of
the
false
and
some
of
the
true
motives
which
can
be
appealed
to
in
but
there
are
various
points
in
their
practical
application
which
may
well
be
considered
may
we
not
question
whether
we
are
not
frequently
too
exacting
with
children
too
much
given
to
were
it
not
that
the
business
of
play
is
so
engrossing
to
them
and
life
so
fascinating
a
matter
on
the
whole
were
it
not
for
these
qualifying
circumstances
we
should
harass
many
of
them
into
dark
cynicism
and
misanthropy
at
a
very
early
age
i
marvel
at
the
scrupulous
exactness
in
regard
to
truth
the
fine
sense
of
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
which
we
require
of
an
unfledged
human
being
who
would
be
puzzled
to
explain
to
us
the
difference
between
a
hawk
and
a
handsaw
who
lives
in
the
realm
of
the
imagination
and
whose
view
of
the
world
is
that
of
a
great
furnished
for
his
benefit
if
we
were
one
half
as
punctilious
and
as
hypercritical
in
our
judgment
of
ourselves
we
should
be
found
guilty
in
short
order
and
sentenced
to
hard
labor
on
a
vast
number
of
counts
there
are
many
comparatively
small
faults
in
children
which
it
is
wise
not
to
see
at
all
they
are
mere
temporary
failings
tiny
drops
which
will
evaporate
if
quietly
left
in
the
sunshine
but
which
if
opposed
will
gather
strength
for
a
formidable
current
if
we
would
sometimes
apply
tolstoi
doctrine
of
to
children
if
we
would
overlook
the
small
transgression
and
quietly
supply
another
vent
for
the
troublesome
activity
there
would
be
less
clashing
of
wills
and
less
raising
of
an
evil
spirit
which
gains
wonderful
strength
while
in
action
do
we
not
often
use
an
arbitrary
and
a
threatening
manner
in
our
commands
to
children
when
a
calm
gentle
request
in
a
tone
of
expectant
confidence
would
gain
obedience
far
more
quickly
and
pleasantly
some
natures
are
antagonized
by
the
shadow
of
a
threat
even
if
it
accompanies
a
reasonable
order
and
if
we
acknowledge
that
the
oil
of
courtesy
is
a
valuable
lubricator
in
our
dealings
with
grown
people
it
seems
proper
to
suppose
that
it
would
not
be
entirely
useless
with
children
we
can
not
expect
to
get
from
them
what
we
do
not
give
ourselves
and
it
is
idle
to
imagine
that
we
can
address
them
as
we
would
a
disobedient
dog
and
be
answered
in
tones
of
dulcet
harmony
again
what
possible
harm
can
there
be
in
sometimes
giving
reasons
for
commands
when
they
are
such
as
the
child
would
appreciate
we
do
not
desire
to
bring
him
up
under
martial
rule
and
if
he
feels
the
wisdom
of
the
order
issued
he
will
be
much
more
likely
to
obey
it
pleasantly
cases
may
frequently
occur
in
which
reasons
either
could
not
properly
be
given
or
would
be
beyond
the
child
power
of
comprehension
but
if
our
treatment
of
him
has
been
uniformly
frank
and
affectionate
he
will
cheerfully
obey
believing
that
as
our
commands
have
been
reasonable
heretofore
there
is
good
cause
to
suppose
they
may
still
be
so
educational
opinion
tends
more
and
more
every
day
to
the
absolute
conviction
that
the
natural
punishment
the
effect
which
follows
the
cause
is
the
only
one
which
can
safely
be
used
with
children
this
is
the
method
of
nature
severe
and
unrelenting
it
may
be
but
calm
firm
and
purely
just
he
who
sows
the
wind
must
reap
the
whirlwind
and
he
who
sows
thistles
may
be
well
assured
that
he
will
never
gather
figs
as
his
harvest
the
feeling
of
continuity
of
sequence
is
naturally
strong
in
the
child
and
if
we
would
lead
him
to
appreciate
that
the
law
is
as
absolute
in
the
moral
as
in
the
physical
world
we
shall
find
the
ground
already
prepared
for
our
purpose
much
transgression
of
moral
law
in
later
years
is
due
to
the
fatal
hope
in
the
mind
that
he
will
be
able
to
escape
the
consequences
of
his
sin
could
we
make
it
clear
from
the
beginning
of
life
that
there
is
no
such
escape
that
the
mills
of
the
gods
will
grind
at
last
though
the
hopper
stand
empty
for
many
a
year
could
we
make
this
an
absolute
conviction
of
the
mind
i
am
assured
that
it
would
greatly
tend
to
lessen
crime
and
this
is
one
of
the
defects
of
arbitrary
punishment
that
it
is
sometimes
withheld
when
the
heart
of
the
judge
melts
over
the
sinner
leading
him
to
expect
other
possible
exemptions
in
the
future
is
it
not
sometimes
given
in
anger
also
when
the
culprit
clearly
sees
it
to
be
disproportionate
to
the
crime
here
appears
the
advantage
of
the
natural
punishment
it
is
never
withheld
in
weak
affection
it
is
never
given
in
anger
it
is
entirely
disassociated
from
personal
feeling
no
poisoned
arrow
of
injustice
remains
rankling
in
the
child
breast
no
rebellious
feeling
that
the
parent
has
taken
advantage
of
his
superior
strength
to
inflict
the
punishment
it
is
perceived
to
be
absolutely
and
being
fair
it
must
be
although
painful
yet
satisfactory
to
that
sense
of
justice
which
is
a
passion
of
childhood
our
american
children
are
as
precocious
in
as
they
are
and
they
need
a
special
discipline
the
courage
activity
and
pioneer
spirit
of
the
fathers
exercised
in
hewing
their
way
through
virgin
forests
hunting
wild
beasts
in
mountain
solitudes
opening
up
undeveloped
lands
prospecting
for
metals
through
trackless
plains
choosing
their
own
vocations
helping
to
govern
their
country
all
these
things
have
reacted
upon
the
children
and
they
are
thoroughly
independent
feeling
the
need
of
caring
for
themselves
when
hardly
able
to
toddle
entrust
this
precocious
bundle
of
nerves
and
individuality
to
a
person
of
weak
will
or
feeble
intelligence
and
the
child
promptly
becomes
his
ruler
the
power
of
strong
volition
becomes
caprice
he
does
not
learn
the
habit
of
obedience
and
thus
valuable
directive
power
is
lost
to
the
world
the
lowest
classes
of
society
says
harris
are
the
lowest
not
because
there
is
any
organized
conspiracy
to
keep
them
down
but
because
they
are
lacking
in
directive
power
the
jails
the
prisons
the
reformatories
are
filled
with
men
who
are
there
because
they
were
weak
more
than
because
they
were
evil
if
the
right
discipline
in
home
and
school
had
been
given
them
they
would
never
have
become
the
charge
of
the
nation
thus
we
waste
force
constantly
force
of
mind
and
of
spirit
sufficient
to
move
mountains
because
we
do
not
insist
that
every
child
shall
exercise
his
inherited
right
which
is
that
he
be
taught
to
obey
it
is
a
grave
subject
this
of
the
gravest
perhaps
that
we
can
consider
and
its
deepest
waters
lie
far
below
the
sounding
of
my
plummet
some
of
the
principles
however
on
which
it
rests
are
as
firmly
fixed
as
the
bed
of
the
ocean
which
remains
changeless
though
the
waves
continually
shift
above
if
we
can
but
cultivate
the
of
doing
right
we
enlist
in
our
service
one
of
the
strongest
of
human
agencies
its
momentum
is
so
great
that
it
may
propel
the
child
into
the
course
of
duty
before
he
has
time
to
discuss
the
question
or
to
parley
with
his
conscience
concerning
it
we
must
remember
that
force
of
character
is
cumulative
and
all
the
foregone
days
of
virtue
work
their
health
into
this
the
task
need
not
be
begun
afresh
each
morning
yesterday
strokes
are
still
there
and
efforts
will
make
the
carving
deeper
and
bolder
we
may
compel
the
body
to
carry
out
an
order
the
fingers
to
perform
a
task
but
this
is
mere
slavish
compliance
true
obedience
can
never
be
enforced
it
is
the
fruit
of
the
reason
and
the
will
the
free
glad
offering
of
the
spirit
though
many
motives
have
their
place
in
early
love
of
approval
deference
to
public
opinion
the
influence
of
beauty
hopeful
occupation
respect
and
rev
for
those
in
authority
yet
these
are
all
preparatory
the
preliminary
exercises
which
must
be
well
practiced
before
the
soul
can
spread
her
wings
into
the
blue
there
is
but
one
true
and
final
motive
to
good
conduct
and
that
is
a
hunger
in
the
soul
of
man
for
the
blessing
of
the
spirit
a
ceaseless
longing
to
be
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
principles
of
everlasting
and
eternal
right
the
magic
of
together
is
the
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
is
an
old
mexican
garden
all
around
it
close
against
the
brown
bricks
the
stand
white
and
stately
guarded
by
their
tall
green
lances
the
sun
rays
are
already
powerful
though
it
is
early
spring
and
i
am
glad
to
take
my
book
under
the
shade
of
the
in
the
dark
above
me
shine
the
delicate
flowers
the
partly
opened
buds
and
the
great
golden
oranges
while
tiny
green
and
spheres
make
a
happy
contrast
in
color
the
ground
about
me
is
strewn
with
flowers
and
buds
the
air
is
heavy
with
fragrance
and
the
bees
are
buzzing
softly
overhead
i
am
growing
drowsy
but
as
i
lift
my
eyes
from
my
book
they
meet
something
which
interests
me
a
large
black
ant
is
tugging
and
pulling
at
an
and
really
making
an
effort
to
carry
it
away
with
him
it
is
once
and
a
half
as
long
as
he
fully
twice
as
wide
and
i
can
not
compute
how
much
heavier
but
its
size
and
weight
are
very
little
regarded
he
drags
it
vigorously
over
alpine
heights
and
through
valley
deeps
but
evidently
finds
the
task
arduous
for
he
stops
to
rest
now
and
then
i
want
to
help
him
but
can
not
be
sure
of
his
destination
and
fear
besides
that
my
clumsy
assistance
would
be
misinterpreted
ah
how
unfortunate
ant
and
have
fallen
together
into
the
depths
of
a
colorado
cañon
which
yawns
in
the
path
the
ant
soon
reappears
but
clearly
feels
it
impossible
to
drag
the
bud
up
such
a
precipice
and
runs
away
on
some
other
quest
what
did
he
want
with
that
bud
i
wonder
was
it
for
food
or
or
a
plaything
for
the
babies
never
mind
i
shall
never
know
and
i
prepare
to
read
again
but
what
this
here
is
my
ant
returning
and
accompanied
by
some
friends
they
disappear
in
the
canon
helpfulness
and
interest
in
every
wave
of
their
feelers
their
heads
come
into
sight
again
and
yes
they
have
the
bud
now
indeed
events
move
and
the
burden
travels
rapidly
across
the
smooth
courtyard
toward
the
house
can
they
intend
to
take
it
up
on
the
flat
roof
where
we
have
lately
suspected
a
nest
yes
there
they
go
straight
up
the
wall
all
putting
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
and
resting
now
and
then
in
the
chinks
of
the
crumbling
adobes
up
the
bud
moves
to
the
gutters
i
can
see
it
gleam
as
it
is
pulled
over
the
edge
they
are
out
of
sight
the
task
is
done
how
easy
any
undertaking
i
think
when
people
are
willing
to
help
in
a
high
dormer
window
of
a
great
city
in
a
nest
of
quilts
and
pillows
sits
little
ingrid
her
blue
danish
eyes
look
out
from
a
pinched
face
and
her
thin
hands
are
languidly
folded
in
her
lap
she
gazes
far
down
below
to
the
other
side
of
the
square
where
she
can
just
see
the
waving
of
some
green
branches
and
an
open
door
her
eyes
brighten
now
for
a
stream
of
little
children
comes
pouring
from
that
door
look
mother
she
cries
there
are
the
children
and
the
mother
leaves
her
washing
and
comes
with
dripping
hands
to
see
every
tiny
boy
look
up
at
the
window
and
flourish
his
hat
and
every
girl
wave
her
handkerchief
or
kiss
her
hand
they
form
a
ring
there
is
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
great
flapping
of
dingy
handkerchiefs
and
battered
hats
a
hearty
cheer
is
heard
they
cheering
my
birthday
cries
ingrid
miss
mary
knows
it
my
birthday
oh
is
it
lovely
and
the
thin
hands
eagerly
waft
some
grateful
kisses
to
the
group
below
the
scene
has
only
lasted
a
few
moments
the
children
have
had
their
run
in
the
fresh
air
and
now
they
go
marching
back
pausing
at
the
door
to
wave
to
the
window
far
above
the
mother
carries
ingrid
back
to
her
bed
it
is
a
weary
time
now
since
those
little
feet
touched
the
floor
but
the
bed
is
not
as
tiresome
as
usual
nor
the
washing
as
hard
for
both
hearts
are
full
of
sunshine
afternoon
comes
little
feet
are
heard
climbing
up
the
stair
and
ingrid
name
is
called
the
door
opens
and
two
flushed
and
breathless
messengers
stand
on
the
threshold
we
brung
you
a
birfday
present
they
cry
it
a
book
and
we
made
it
all
our
own
and
all
the
chilluns
helped
and
made
somefin
to
put
in
it
miss
mary
down
stairs
mindin
the
babies
and
she
sends
you
her
love
happy
birfday
happy
birthday
indeed
golden
precious
birthday
was
ever
such
a
book
so
full
of
sweet
messages
and
tender
thoughts
ingrid
knows
how
baby
tim
must
have
labored
to
sew
that
red
circle
how
john
jacob
toiled
over
that
and
elsa
carefully
folded
the
drove
of
little
pigs
everybody
thought
of
her
and
all
the
chilluns
helped
and
how
dear
is
the
tangible
outcome
of
the
thoughts
and
the
helping
far
back
in
the
childhood
of
the
world
the
savage
woaded
in
skins
went
roaming
for
his
food
wherever
he
might
find
it
he
dug
roots
from
the
ground
he
searched
for
berries
and
fruits
he
hid
behind
rocks
to
leap
upon
his
living
prey
yet
often
went
hungry
to
his
lair
at
night
if
the
were
short
or
the
wild
beast
wary
but
if
the
day
had
been
a
fortunate
one
if
his
own
stomach
were
filled
and
his
body
sheltered
little
cared
he
whether
savage
number
two
were
hungry
and
cold
every
one
for
himself
would
he
say
as
he
rolled
himself
in
his
skins
and
the
or
any
other
handy
beast
take
the
hindmost
the
simplicity
of
his
mental
state
his
complete
freedom
from
responsibility
assure
us
that
his
digestion
of
the
raw
flesh
and
the
tough
roots
must
have
been
perfection
and
the
sleep
in
those
furred
skins
a
dreamless
one
what
impending
visitation
of
a
common
enemy
what
sudden
descent
of
a
fierce
horde
of
strange
wild
creatures
first
moved
him
to
ally
himself
with
barbarians
number
two
and
three
for
their
mutual
protection
and
when
long
years
of
alliance
in
warfare
and
mutual
distrust
at
all
other
times
had
slipped
away
and
when
savages
were
turning
into
herdsmen
and
farmers
and
toolmakers
to
what
leader
among
men
did
a
system
of
exchange
of
commodities
for
mutual
convenience
suggest
itself
one
would
like
to
have
met
that
painted
savage
who
first
suggested
combination
in
warfare
or
that
later
upon
whom
it
faintly
dawned
that
mutual
help
was
possible
in
other
directions
save
that
of
a
union
born
of
the
exigencies
of
warfare
would
be
strengthened
later
by
the
promptings
of
and
lo
the
experiment
is
no
longer
an
experiment
and
the
fact
is
proven
that
men
may
fight
and
work
together
to
their
mutual
profit
and
advancement
is
a
simple
proposition
after
all
that
ten
times
one
is
ten
and
the
bees
the
ants
the
grosbeaks
and
the
beavers
prove
it
so
clearly
that
any
one
of
us
may
read
though
we
pass
by
never
so
quickly
yet
all
great
truths
appear
in
man
mind
in
very
rudimentary
form
at
first
and
each
successive
generation
furnishes
more
favorable
soil
for
their
growth
and
development
first
men
joined
hands
in
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
second
they
found
that
even
when
wars
were
over
still
communication
intercourse
and
exchange
of
goods
were
desirable
third
they
discovered
that
no
great
enterprise
which
would
better
their
condition
would
be
possible
without
coöperation
and
fourth
they
began
to
band
themselves
together
here
and
there
not
only
for
their
own
protection
for
their
own
gain
but
to
watch
over
the
weak
to
succor
the
defenseless
and
even
to
uphold
some
dear
belief
the
magic
of
together
has
thus
far
reached
and
who
can
tell
what
happy
valley
what
fair
land
of
beulah
it
may
summon
into
existence
in
the
future
the
incalculable
value
of
coöperation
the
solemn
truth
that
we
are
members
one
of
another
that
we
can
not
labor
for
ourselves
without
laboring
for
others
nor
injure
ourselves
without
injuring
others
all
this
is
intellectually
appreciated
by
most
men
all
this
is
doubtless
acknowledged
yet
i
can
not
find
that
it
has
obtained
much
recognition
in
education
nor
is
especially
insisted
upon
in
the
training
of
children
but
surely
if
children
have
any
social
tendencies
and
the
fact
needs
no
proof
these
tendencies
should
be
given
direction
from
the
beginning
toward
benevolence
toward
harmonious
working
together
for
some
common
aim
this
would
be
comparatively
easy
even
in
a
nursery
containing
three
or
four
little
people
and
how
much
simpler
when
school
life
begins
and
when
the
powers
of
children
are
greatly
increased
while
they
are
in
hourly
contact
with
a
large
number
of
equals
society
as
hale
says
is
the
great
charm
and
only
value
of
school
life
but
this
charm
and
this
value
are
reduced
to
a
minimum
in
many
schools
emulation
that
of
aspiration
so
often
used
as
a
stimulus
in
education
must
forever
separate
the
child
from
his
fellows
how
can
i
have
any
christian
fellowship
with
a
man
when
i
am
envying
him
his
successes
and
grudging
him
his
honors
am
i
not
tempted
to
withhold
my
help
from
my
weak
brother
across
the
way
lest
my
assistance
place
him
on
an
equality
with
me
again
the
monitor
system
as
sometimes
carried
out
tends
to
separation
and
engenders
dislike
and
distrust
i
am
not
likely
to
desire
close
communion
except
in
the
way
of
fisticuffs
with
a
boy
who
has
been
spying
upon
me
all
day
or
who
has
very
likely
reported
me
as
having
committed
divers
venial
offenses
it
is
the
idea
of
some
teachers
that
discipline
is
furthered
if
children
are
trained
to
have
as
little
as
possible
to
do
with
each
other
and
there
is
no
question
that
this
method
does
facilitate
a
kind
of
government
it
would
probably
be
more
satisfactory
to
such
a
teacher
if
each
child
could
be
brought
to
school
in
a
with
only
one
window
and
that
in
front
and
could
be
kept
in
it
during
the
whole
session
as
such
a
plan
however
is
scarcely
feasible
as
children
with
or
against
our
wills
have
a
natural
and
instinct
for
each
other
company
as
they
keenly
enjoy
banding
themselves
together
for
whatever
purpose
should
not
education
follow
the
suggestions
which
an
earnest
study
of
can
but
give
froebel
with
those
divinely
curious
eyes
of
his
saw
deeper
into
the
child
mind
and
heart
than
any
of
his
predecessors
and
for
every
faint
stirring
of
life
which
he
perceived
provided
adequate
conditions
of
development
true
prophet
of
the
coming
day
his
philosophy
is
rich
with
suggestions
for
the
cultivation
of
the
social
powers
of
the
child
no
one
ever
felt
more
keenly
than
he
the
inseparable
the
organic
connection
of
all
life
and
with
deep
spiritual
insight
he
provides
nursery
plays
and
songs
by
which
the
babe
even
in
his
mother
arms
may
be
led
faintly
to
recognize
in
his
being
one
of
the
links
of
the
great
chain
which
girdles
the
universe
later
when
as
a
child
of
three
or
four
years
he
makes
his
first
step
into
the
world
and
loosing
his
mother
hand
enters
a
larger
family
of
children
of
his
own
age
he
is
still
led
to
feel
himself
a
part
of
a
vast
union
each
member
of
which
has
ministered
to
him
and
numberless
ways
are
opened
by
which
he
can
join
with
others
to
give
back
to
the
world
some
of
the
benefits
he
has
enjoyed
stories
are
told
and
games
are
played
which
lead
him
to
thank
the
kindly
hands
which
have
furnished
his
daily
bread
his
warm
clothing
and
his
sweet
white
bed
at
night
the
feeling
of
gratitude
grown
and
strengthened
must
overflow
in
action
the
world
has
done
so
much
for
him
what
can
he
do
for
the
world
is
there
not
some
little
invalid
who
would
greatly
prize
a
book
of
dainty
pictures
embroidered
drawn
and
painted
by
her
then
he
will
join
with
his
companions
and
patiently
and
lovingly
fashion
such
a
book
is
the
class
room
somewhat
bare
and
colorless
then
he
can
give
up
some
of
his
cherished
work
to
make
a
bright
frieze
about
the
walls
a
national
holiday
is
perhaps
approaching
he
will
unite
with
all
the
other
babies
in
making
flags
chains
and
rosettes
to
deck
the
room
appropriately
and
to
please
the
mothers
fathers
and
friends
who
are
coming
to
celebrate
the
occasion
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
which
is
offered
is
that
of
being
allowed
to
help
somebody
if
a
child
is
quick
neat
and
careful
if
he
has
finished
his
bit
of
work
he
may
go
and
help
the
babies
and
very
gently
and
very
patiently
he
guides
the
chubby
fingers
threads
the
needles
or
ties
on
little
caps
and
conquers
refractory
buttons
to
be
a
little
helper
whether
he
is
assisting
his
companions
or
the
people
about
him
grows
to
seem
the
highest
honor
within
his
reach
he
knows
the
joy
of
ministering
unto
others
and
he
feels
that
to
help
is
to
do
the
work
of
the
world
thus
we
endeavor
to
give
external
expression
to
the
feelings
stirring
in
the
heart
of
the
child
knowing
that
even
love
can
grow
cold
if
not
nourished
the
whole
spirit
of
the
work
if
carried
out
as
froebel
intended
must
tend
directly
toward
social
evolution
and
the
intense
personalism
which
is
a
distinguishing
mark
of
our
civilization
and
is
clearly
seen
in
our
children
needs
anointing
with
the
oil
of
altruism
the
circle
in
which
the
children
stand
for
the
singing
is
itself
a
perfect
representation
of
unity
hands
are
joined
to
make
a
round
and
lovely
ring
if
any
child
is
unkind
or
regardless
of
the
rights
of
others
it
is
easily
seen
that
he
not
only
makes
himself
unhappy
but
seriously
mars
the
pleasure
of
all
the
other
children
if
he
willfully
leaves
the
circle
a
link
in
the
chain
is
broken
which
can
only
be
mended
when
he
repents
his
folly
and
pleasantly
returns
to
his
place
thus
early
he
may
be
made
to
feel
that
all
lives
touch
his
own
and
that
his
indulgence
in
selfish
passion
not
only
harms
himself
but
is
the
more
blameworthy
in
that
it
injures
others
the
songs
and
games
can
not
be
happily
carried
on
unless
each
child
is
not
only
willing
to
help
but
willing
also
to
give
up
his
chief
desires
now
and
then
all
the
children
would
like
to
be
the
flowers
in
the
garden
perhaps
but
it
is
obvious
that
some
must
remain
in
the
circle
in
order
that
the
fence
be
perfect
and
prevent
stray
animals
from
destroying
what
we
love
and
cherish
so
there
is
constant
surrendering
of
personal
desires
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
others
have
equal
rights
and
that
after
all
one
part
is
as
good
as
another
since
all
are
essential
to
the
whole
in
coöperative
building
the
children
quickly
see
that
the
symmetrical
figure
which
four
little
ones
have
made
together
uniting
their
material
is
infinitely
larger
and
finer
than
any
one
of
them
could
have
made
alone
if
they
are
making
a
village
at
their
little
tables
one
builds
the
church
another
workshops
and
stores
others
schools
and
houses
while
the
remainder
make
roads
lay
out
gardens
plant
trees
and
plough
the
fields
no
one
of
the
children
had
strength
enough
time
enough
or
material
enough
to
build
the
village
alone
yet
see
how
well
and
how
quickly
it
is
done
when
we
all
help
the
in
which
of
course
all
children
delight
lends
itself
especially
to
coöperative
exercises
they
gather
around
it
and
plant
gardens
with
the
balls
they
use
it
for
geography
moulding
the
hills
mountains
valleys
and
tracing
the
rivers
near
their
homes
they
arrange
historical
dramas
as
paul
revere
ride
or
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
but
no
child
does
any
one
of
these
things
alone
there
is
constant
and
happy
coöperation
it
is
the
aim
of
one
day
exercise
perhaps
to
retrace
with
the
child
the
various
steps
by
which
his
comfortable
chair
and
his
strong
have
come
to
him
across
one
end
of
the
a
group
of
children
plant
a
forest
with
little
pine
branches
which
they
have
brought
the
come
fell
the
trees
and
cut
away
the
boughs
another
party
of
children
bring
the
heavy
teams
previously
built
from
the
harness
in
the
horses
taken
from
a
noah
ark
and
prepare
to
carry
off
the
logs
now
here
come
the
and
they
lay
out
a
smooth
hard
road
for
the
teams
reaching
to
the
very
bank
of
the
river
which
another
party
of
little
ones
has
made
the
logs
are
tumbled
into
the
stream
they
float
downward
are
rafted
carried
to
the
mill
little
sticks
are
furnished
to
represent
the
boards
into
which
they
are
sawn
and
the
lumber
is
taken
to
the
that
he
may
fashion
our
furniture
though
there
be
twenty
children
around
the
yet
all
have
been
employed
each
has
enjoyed
his
own
work
yet
appreciated
the
value
of
his
neighbor
they
have
worked
together
harmoniously
and
the
doing
has
reacted
upon
the
heart
and
strengthened
the
feeling
of
unity
which
is
growing
within
such
exercises
can
not
fail
to
teach
the
value
and
power
of
social
effort
and
the
necessity
of
subordinating
personal
desires
to
the
common
good
yet
the
development
of
individuality
is
not
forgotten
for
our
power
as
individuals
depends
upon
our
recognition
of
the
rights
of
others
it
is
true
that
the
social
problem
is
an
intricate
one
and
can
not
be
worked
out
even
partially
at
any
stage
of
education
unless
the
leader
of
the
children
be
a
true
leader
and
be
enthusiastically
convinced
of
the
essential
value
of
the
principles
on
which
the
problem
is
based
yet
this
might
be
said
with
equal
truth
of
any
educational
aim
for
the
gospel
must
always
have
its
interpreters
and
some
will
ever
give
a
more
spiritual
reading
and
seize
the
truth
which
was
only
half
expressed
while
others
mechanical
kill
with
the
letter
after
all
says
stanley
hall
there
is
nothing
so
practical
in
education
as
the
ideal
nor
so
ideal
as
the
practical
and
we
may
be
assured
that
the
direction
of
the
social
tendencies
of
the
child
toward
high
and
noble
aims
toward
the
sinking
of
self
and
the
generous
thought
of
others
that
this
is
not
only
ideal
not
only
a
following
after
the
purest
light
yet
vouchsafed
to
us
but
is
at
the
same
time
practical
in
its
detailed
workings
and
in
its
adaptation
to
the
needs
and
desires
of
the
day
the
relation
of
the
kindergarten
to
the
public
school
the
nature
of
an
educational
system
is
determined
by
the
manner
in
which
it
is
begun
the
question
for
us
to
decide
is
not
how
we
can
interest
people
in
and
how
illustrate
the
true
kindergarten
for
that
is
already
done
to
a
considerable
extent
but
how
we
can
convince
school
boards
superintendents
and
voters
that
the
final
introduction
of
the
kindergarten
into
the
public
school
system
is
a
thing
greatly
to
be
desired
the
kindergarten
and
the
school
now
two
distinct
dissimilar
and
sometimes
though
of
late
very
seldom
antagonistic
institutions
how
will
the
one
affect
or
be
affected
by
the
other
as
to
the
final
adoption
of
the
kindergarten
there
is
a
preliminary
question
which
goes
straight
to
the
root
of
the
whole
matter
at
present
the
state
accepts
the
responsibility
of
educating
children
after
an
arbitrarily
fixed
age
has
been
reached
ought
it
not
rather
if
it
assumes
the
responsibility
at
all
to
begin
to
educate
the
child
when
he
education
thoughtful
people
are
now
awaking
to
the
fact
that
this
regulation
is
an
artificial
not
a
natural
one
and
that
we
have
been
wasting
two
precious
years
which
might
not
only
be
put
to
valuable
uses
but
would
so
shape
and
influence
that
every
succeeding
step
would
be
taken
with
greater
ease
and
profit
we
have
been
discreet
in
omitting
the
beginning
so
long
as
we
did
not
feel
sure
how
to
begin
but
we
know
now
that
froebel
method
of
dealing
with
four
or
five
year
old
babies
when
used
by
a
discreet
and
intelligent
person
justifies
us
in
taking
this
delicate
debatable
ground
so
far
then
it
is
a
question
of
law
a
law
which
can
be
modified
just
as
soon
and
as
sensibly
as
the
people
wish
before
however
that
modification
can
become
the
active
wish
of
the
people
its
importance
must
be
understood
and
its
effects
estimated
could
it
be
shown
that
will
be
hindered
or
in
any
way
rendered
more
difficult
by
the
kindergarten
clearly
all
efforts
to
introduce
it
must
cease
were
it
merely
a
matter
of
indifference
something
that
would
neither
make
nor
mar
the
of
schools
then
it
would
remain
a
matter
of
choice
or
fancy
for
individual
parents
to
decide
as
they
like
but
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
work
of
the
kindergarten
will
lay
a
more
solid
foundation
or
trace
more
direct
paths
for
the
workers
of
a
later
period
then
it
behooves
us
to
give
it
a
hearty
welcome
and
to
work
out
its
principles
with
zealous
good
will
and
working
out
its
principles
means
accepting
it
as
a
finality
a
piece
of
flawless
perfection
but
as
a
which
will
lead
us
nearer
to
the
truth
if
it
is
a
good
thing
it
is
good
for
all
if
it
is
truth
we
want
it
everywhere
but
if
this
new
department
of
education
and
training
is
to
gain
ground
or
accomplish
the
successful
fruition
of
its
wishes
there
must
be
perfect
unity
among
teachers
concerning
it
if
they
all
understood
the
thing
itself
and
understood
each
other
there
could
be
no
lack
of
sympathy
yet
there
has
been
misunderstanding
conflict
occasionally
and
some
otherwise
worthy
teachers
have
used
the
kindergarten
as
a
sort
of
intellectual
to
sharpen
their
conversational
bills
upon
of
course
i
am
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
after
we
have
determined
that
we
ought
to
have
the
kindergarten
there
are
many
questions
of
expediency
suitable
rooms
expense
of
material
salaries
assistants
age
of
children
at
entrance
system
of
government
number
of
children
in
one
kindergarten
and
greatest
of
all
but
least
thought
of
strangely
the
linking
together
of
kindergarten
and
school
so
that
the
development
shall
be
continuous
and
the
chain
of
impressions
perfect
and
unbroken
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
has
been
done
and
can
be
done
again
but
it
needs
discretion
forethought
tact
earnestness
and
unimpeachable
honesty
of
administration
for
unless
we
can
depend
upon
our
school
boards
and
kindergartners
counting
upon
them
for
wise
coöperation
brooding
care
and
great
wisdom
in
selection
of
teachers
the
experiment
will
be
a
failure
we
have
risks
enough
to
run
as
it
is
let
us
not
permit
our
little
ones
more
susceptible
by
reason
of
age
than
any
we
have
to
deal
with
now
let
us
not
permit
them
to
become
victims
of
politics
rings
or
machine
teaching
the
kindergarten
is
more
liable
to
abuse
than
any
other
department
of
teaching
there
is
no
ground
in
the
universe
so
sacred
as
this
but
the
difference
between
primary
schools
is
just
as
great
only
unfortunately
we
have
become
used
to
it
and
the
kindergarten
being
under
fire
so
to
speak
must
be
absolutely
ideal
in
its
perfection
or
it
is
ruthlessly
held
up
to
scorn
there
is
a
tremendous
awakening
all
over
the
country
with
regard
to
kindergarten
and
primary
work
and
this
is
well
since
the
greatest
and
most
fatal
mistakes
of
the
public
school
system
have
been
made
and
the
time
is
surely
coming
when
more
knowledge
wisdom
tact
ingenuity
forethought
yes
and
money
will
be
expended
in
order
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
case
the
time
is
coming
when
the
imp
of
parsimony
will
no
longer
be
mistaken
for
the
spirit
of
economy
when
a
woman
possessed
of
ordinary
human
frailty
will
no
longer
be
required
to
guide
direct
develop
train
help
love
and
be
patient
with
sixty
little
ones
just
beginning
to
tread
the
difficult
paths
of
learning
and
each
receiving
just
one
sixtieth
of
what
he
craves
the
millennium
will
be
close
at
hand
when
we
cease
to
expect
from
girls
just
out
of
the
high
school
what
socrates
never
attempted
and
would
have
deemed
impossible
look

each

these

are

for
and

by
four
or
five
trained
teachers

in
the
training
of

ever
objects
so
far
as
i
know
to
such
expenditure
of
labor
and
money
the
end
is
supposed
to
justify
the
means
but
when
the
creatures
to
be
trained
are
human
beings
and
when
the
end
to
be
reached
is
not
but
merely
citizens
we
employ
a
very
different
process
of
reasoning
that
this
subject
of
early
training
is
a
vitally
interesting
one
to
thinking
people
can
not
be
denied
the
kindergarten
has
become
the
fashion
you
say
cynically
this
is
scarcely
true
but
it
is
a
fact
that
the
upper
the
middle
and
the
lower
classes
among
us
begin
to
recognize
the
existence
of
children
under
six
years
of
age
and
realize
that
far
from
being
nonentities
in
life
or
unknown
quantities
they
are
very
lively
units
in
the
sum
of
progressive
education
when
we
speak
of
kindergarten
work
among
the
children
of
the
poor
and
argue
its
claims
as
one
of
the
best
means
of
taking
unfortunate
little
arabs
from
the
demoralizing
life
of
the
streets
and
of
giving
their
aimless
hands
something
useful
to
do
their
restless
minds
something
good
and
fruitful
to
think
of
and
their
curious
eyes
something
beautiful
to
look
on
there
is
not
a
word
of
disapproval
people
seem
willing
to
concede
its
moral
value
when
applied
to
the
lower
classes
but
when
they
are
obliged
to
pay
anything
to
procure
this
training
for
their
own
children
or
see
any
prospect
of
what
they
call
an
already
extravagant
school
system
made
more
so
by
its
addition
they
become
prolific
in
doubts
in
other
words
they
believe
in
it
when
you
call
it
but
not
when
you
call
it
and
it
must
be
called
the
germ
of
the
better
education
toward
which
we
are
all
struggling
the
nearest
approach
to
the
perfect
beginning
which
we
have
yet
found
we
see
in
the
excellence
of
froebel
idea
educationally
considered
its
only
claim
to
peculiar
power
in
dealing
with
incipient
hoodlumism
it
is
only
because
it
has
such
unusual
fitness
to
such
a
store
of
philosophy
and
ingenuity
in
its
appliances
and
such
a
wealth
of
spiritual
truth
in
its
aims
and
methods
that
it
is
so
great
a
power
with
neglected
children
and
ignorant
and
vicious
parents
the
principles
on
which
froebel
built
his
educational
idea
may
be
summed
up
briefly
under
four
heads
first
all
the
faculties
of
the
child
are
to
be
drawn
out
and
exercised
as
far
as
age
allows
second
the
powers
of
habit
and
association
which
are
the
great
instruments
of
all
education
of
the
whole
training
of
life
must
be
developed
with
a
systematic
purpose
from
the
earliest
dawn
of
intelligence
third
the
active
instincts
of
childhood
are
to
be
cultivated
through
manual
exercise
chiefly
creative
in
character
which
is
made
an
essential
part
of
the
training
and
this
manual
exercise
is
to
be
valued
chiefly
as
a
means
of
fourth
the
senses
are
to
be
trained
to
accuracy
as
well
as
the
hand
the
child
must
learn
how
to
observe
what
is
placed
before
him
and
to
observe
it
truly
an
acquirement
which
any
teacher
of
science
or
art
will
appreciate
to
work
out
these
principles
froebel
devised
his
practical
method
of
infant
education
and
the
very
name
he
gave
to
the
place
where
his
play
lessons
were
to
be
used
marks
his
purpose
no
books
are
to
be
seen
in
a
kindergarten
because
no
ideas
or
facts
are
presented
to
the
child
that
he
can
not
clearly
understand
and
verify
the
object
is
not
to
teach
him
arithmetic
or
geometry
though
he
learns
enough
of
both
to
be
very
useful
to
him
hereafter
but
to
lead
him
to
discover
concerning
forms
and
numbers
lines
and
angles
for
himself
thus
in
the
the
teacher
simply
rules
the
order
in
which
the
child
shall
approach
a
new
thing
and
gives
him
the
correct
names
which
henceforth
he
must
always
use
but
the
observation
of
resemblances
and
differences
that
groundwork
of
all
knowledge
the
reasoning
from
one
point
to
another
and
the
conclusions
he
arrives
at
are
all
his
own
he
is
only
led
to
see
his
mistake
if
he
makes
one
the
child
handles
every
object
from
which
he
is
taught
and
learns
to
reproduce
it
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
any
ordinary
system
of
object
teaching
in
the
hands
of
an
ingenious
teacher
will
serve
the
purpose
or
take
the
place
of
the
kindergarten
people
who
say
this
evidently
have
no
conception
of
froebel
plan
in
which
the
simultaneous
training
of
head
heart
and
hand
is
the
most
striking
characteristic
the
kindergarten
is
mainly
distinguished
from
the
later
instruction
of
the
school
by
making
the
knowledge
of
facts
and
the
cultivation
of
the
memory
subordinate
to
the
development
of
observation
and
to
the
appropriate
activity
of
the
child
physical
mental
and
moral
its
aim
is
to
utilize
the
now
almost
wasted
time
from
four
to
six
years
a
time
when
all
negligent
and
ignorant
mothers
leave
the
child
to
chance
development
and
when
the
most
careful
mother
can
not
train
her
child
into
the
practice
of
social
virtues
so
well
as
the
truly
wise
kindergartner
who
works
with
her
we
learn
through
doing
is
the
watchword
of
the
kindergarten
but
it
must
be
a
which
blossoms
into
or
it
does
not
fulfill
its
ideal
for
it
is
character
building
which
is
to
go
on
in
the
kindergarten
or
it
has
missed
froebel
aim
what
does
the
kindergarten
do
for
children
under
six
years
of
age
what
has
it
accomplished
when
it
sends
the
child
to
the
primary
school
i
do
not
mean
what
froebel
hoped
could
be
done
or
what
is
occasionally
accomplished
with
bright
children
and
a
gifted
teacher
or
even
what
is
done
in
good
private
kindergartens
for
that
is
yet
more
but
i
mean
what
is
actually
done
for
children
by
charitable
organizations
which
are
really
doing
the
work
of
the
state
i
think
they
can
claim
tangible
results
which
are
wholly
remarkable
and
yet
they
do
not
work
for
results
or
expect
much
visible
fruit
in
these
tender
years
from
a
culture
which
is
so
natural
and
unobtrusive
that
its
very
outward
simplicity
has
caused
it
to
be
regarded
as
a
plaything
in
glancing
over
the
acquirements
of
the
child
who
has
left
the
kindergarten
and
has
been
actually
nothing
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
word
we
find
that
he
has
worked
experimented
invented
compared
reproduced
all
things
have
been
revealed
in
the
doing
and
productive
activity
has
enlightened
and
developed
the
mind
first
as
to
arithmetic
it
does
not
come
first
but
though
you
speak
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
angels
and
make
not
mention
of
arithmetic
it
profiteth
you
nothing
the
first
gift
shows
one
object
and
the
children
get
an
idea
of
one
whole
in
the
second
they
receive
three
whole
objects
again
but
of
different
form
in
the
third
and
fourth
the
regularly
divided
cube
is
seen
and
all
possible
combinations
of
numbers
as
far
as
eight
are
made
in
the
fifth
gift
the
child
sees
three
and
its
multiples
in
fractions
halves
quarters
eighths
thirds
ninths
and
with
the
sixth
seventh
and
eighth
gifts
the
field
is
practically
unlimited
second
as
to
the
child
knowledge
of
form
size
and
proportion
his
development
has
been
quite
extensive
he
knows
not
always
by
name
but
by
their
characteristics
vertical
horizontal
slanting
and
curved
lines
squares
oblongs
equal
sided
blunt
and
sharp
angled
triangles
five
six
seven
and
eight
sided
figures
spheres
cylinders
cubes
and
prisms
all
this
elementary
geometry
has
of
course
been
learned
baby
fashion
in
a
purely
experimental
way
but
nothing
will
have
to
be
unlearned
when
the
pupil
approaches
geometry
later
in
a
more
thoroughly
scientific
spirit
third
as
to
the
cultivation
of
language
of
the
power
of
expression
we
can
not
speak
with
too
much
emphasis
the
vocabulary
of
the
kindergarten
child
of
the
lower
classes
is
probably
greater
than
that
of
his
mother
or
father
you
can
see
how
this
comes
about
the
teachers
themselves
are
obliged
to
make
a
study
of
simple
appropriate
expressive
and
explicit
language
the
child
is
led
to
express
all
his
thoughts
freely
in
proper
words
from
the
moment
he
can
lisp
he
is
trained
through
singing
to
distinct
and
careful
enunciation
and
the
result
is
a
remarkably
good
power
of
language
i
make
haste
to
say
that
this
need
not
necessarily
be
used
for
the
purposes
of
chattering
in
the
school
the
child
has
not
of
course
learned
to
read
and
write
but
reading
is
greatly
simplified
by
his
accurate
power
of
observation
and
his
practice
of
comparing
forms
the
work
of
reading
is
play
to
a
child
whose
eye
has
been
thus
trained
as
to
writing
we
precede
it
by
drawing
which
is
the
sensible
and
natural
plan
the
child
will
have
had
a
good
deal
of
practice
with
slate
and
lead
pencil
will
have
drawn
all
sorts
of
lines
and
figures
from
dictation
and
have
created
numberless
designs
of
his
own
if
in
short
our
children
could
spend
two
years
in
a
good
kindergarten
they
would
not
only
bring
to
the
school
those
elements
of
knowledge
which
are
required
but
would
have
learned
in
some
degree
how
to
and
in
the
measure
of
their
progress
nothing
to
let
those
who
labor
day
by
day
with
inert
minds
never
yet
awakened
to
a
wish
for
knowledge
a
sense
of
beauty
or
a
feeling
of
pleasure
in
mental
activity
tell
us
how
much
valuable
school
time
they
would
save
if
the
raw
material
were
thus
prepared
to
their
hand
after
spending
five
or
six
years
at
home
or
in
the
street
without
training
or
discipline
the
child
is
sent
to
school
and
is
expected
to
learn
at
once
he
looks
upon
the
strange
new
life
with
amazement
yet
without
understanding
finally
his
mind
becomes
familiar
in
a
mechanical
manner
to
the
tastes
of
a
child
with
the
work
and
exercises
of
primary
instruction
the
consequence
being
very
often
a
feeble
body
and
a
stuffed
mind
the
stuffing
having
very
little
more
effect
upon
the
intellect
than
it
has
upon
the
organism
of
a
roast
turkey
the
kindergarten
can
remedy
these
intellectual
difficulties
beside
giving
the
child
an
impulse
toward
moral
and
a
capacity
for
working
out
his
original
ideas
in
visible
and
permanent
form
which
will
make
him
almost
a
new
creature
it
can
by
taking
the
child
in
season
set
the
wheels
in
motion
rouse
all
his
best
finest
and
highest
instincts
the
purest
noblest
and
most
vivifying
powers
of
which
he
is
possessed
there
is
a
good
deal
of
time
spent
in
the
kindergarten
on
the
cultivation
of
politeness
and
courtesy
and
in
the
entirely
social
atmosphere
which
is
one
of
its
principal
features
the
amenities
of
polite
society
can
be
better
practiced
than
elsewhere
the
kindergarten
aims
in
no
way
at
making
infant
prodigies
but
it
aims
successfully
at
putting
the
little
child
in
possession
of
every
faculty
he
is
capable
of
using
at
bringing
him
forward
on
lines
he
will
never
need
to
forsake
at
teaching
within
his
narrow
range
what
he
will
never
have
to
unlearn
and
at
giving
him
the
wish
to
learn
and
the
power
of
teaching
himself
its
deep
simplicity
should
always
be
maintained
and
no
lover
of
childhood
or
thoughtful
teacher
would
wish
it
otherwise
it
is
more
important
that
it
should
be
kept
pure
than
that
it
should
become
popular
i
have
tried
thus
somewhat
at
length
to
demonstrate
that
our
educational
system
can
not
be
perfect
until
we
begin
still
earlier
with
the
child
and
begin
in
a
more
childlike
manner
though
at
the
same
time
earnestly
and
with
definite
purpose
in
trying
to
make
manhood
and
womanhood
we
sometimes
treat
children
as
little
men
and
women
not
realizing
that
the
most
perfect
childhood
is
the
best
basis
for
strong
manhood
further
i
have
tried
to
show
that
froebel
system
gives
us
the
only
rational
beginning
but
i
confess
frankly
that
to
make
it
productive
of
its
vaunted
results
it
must
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
thoroughly
trained
kindergartners
fitted
by
nature
and
by
education
for
their
most
delicate
exacting
and
sacred
profession
now
as
to
compromises
the
question
is
frequently
asked
can
not
the
best
things
of
the
kindergarten
be
introduced
in
the
primary
departments
of
the
public
school
the
best
thing
of
kindergartening
is
the
kindergarten
itself
and
nothing
else
will
do
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
very
material
changes
in
the
primary
class
which
is
to
include
a
kindergarten
changes
that
are
demanded
by
radically
different
methods
the
kindergarten
should
offer
the
child
experience
instead
of
instruction
life
instead
of
learning
practical
a
miniature
world
where
he
lives
and
grows
and
learns
and
expands
no
primary
teacher
were
she
minerva
herself
can
work
out
froebel
idea
successfully
with
sixty
or
seventy
children
under
her
sole
care
you
will
see
for
yourselves
that
this
simple
natural
motherly
instruction
of
babyhood
can
not
be
transplanted
bodily
into
the
primary
school
where
the
teacher
has
fifty
or
sixty
children
who
are
beyond
the
two
most
fruitful
years
which
the
kindergarten
demands
besides
the
teachers
of
the
lower
grades
can
not
introduce
more
than
an
infinitesimal
number
of
kindergarten
exercises
and
at
the
same
time
keep
up
their
full
routine
of
primary
studies
and
exercises
any
one
who
understands
the
double
needs
of
the
kindergarten
and
primary
school
can
not
fail
to
see
this
matter
correctly
and
as
i
said
before
we
do
not
want
a
few
kindergarten
exercises
we
want
the
if
teachers
were
all
indoctrinated
with
the
spirit
of
froebel
method
they
would
carry
on
its
principles
in
dealing
with
pupils
of
any
age
but
froebel
kindergarten
pure
and
simple
creates
a
place
for
children
of
four
or
five
years
to
begin
their
bit
of
it
is
in
no
sense
a
school
nor
must
become
so
or
it
would
lose
its
very
essence
and
truest
meaning
let
me
show
you
a
kindergarten
it
is
no
more
interesting
than
a
good
school
but
i
want
you
to
see
the
essential
points
of
difference
it
is
a
golden
morning
a
rare
one
in
a
long
rainy
winter
as
we
turn
into
the
narrow
quiet
street
from
the
broader
noisy
one
the
sound
of
a
bell
warns
us
that
we
are
near
the
kindergarten
building
a
few
belated
youngsters
are
hurrying
along
some
ragged
some
patched
some
plainly
and
neatly
clothed
some
finishing
a
portable
breakfast
thrust
into
their
hands
five
minutes
before
but
all
eager
to
be
there
while
the
lilliputian
armies
are
wending
their
way
from
the
yard
to
their
various
rooms
we
will
enter
the
front
door
and
look
about
a
little
the
windows
are
wide
open
at
one
end
of
the
great
room
the
walls
are
tinted
with
terra
cotta
and
the
woodwork
is
painted
in
indian
red
above
the
high
wood
dado
runs
a
row
of
illuminated
pictures
of
animals
ducks
pigeons
peacocks
calves
lambs
colts
and
almost
everything
else
that
goes
upon
two
or
four
feet
so
that
the
children
can
by
simply
turning
in
their
seats
stroke
the
heads
of
their
dumb
friends
of
the
meadow
and
barnyard
there
are
a
great
quantity
of
bright
and
appropriate
pictures
on
the
walls
three
windows
full
of
plants
a
canary
chirping
in
a
gilded
cage
a
globe
of
an
open
piano
and
an
sofa
which
is
at
present
adorned
with
a
small
scrap
of
a
boy
who
clutches
a
large
slate
in
one
hand
and
a
mammoth
in
the
other
it
is
his
first
day
and
he
looks
as
if
his
big
brother
had
told
him
that
he
would
be
walloped
if
he
so
much
as
winked
a
charming
girls
are
fluttering
about
charming
because
whether
plain
or
beautiful
they
all
look
happy
earnest
womanly
full
to
the
brim
of
life
a
sweet
cheerfulness
like
of
the
year
seems
ever
on
their
steps
to
wait
they
are
tying
on
white
aprons
and
preparing
the
occupations
for
they
are
a
detachment
of
students
from
a
kindergarten
training
school
and
are
on
duty
for
the
day
one
of
them
seats
herself
at
the
piano
and
plays
a
stirring
march
the
army
enters
each
tiny

with
a
shining

and
i
glad

in
it
so
the
bright

seem
to
say
it
is

that
marches
into

swarthy

woolly

long

and

here
you
see
the

and

of
the
southern

and
the
serenity
and

of
northern

what
an
opportunity
for
amalgamation
of
races
and
for
laying
the
foundation
of
american
citizenship
for
the
purely
social
atmosphere
of
the
kindergarten
makes
it
a
where
each
tiny
citizen
has
full
liberty
under
the
law
of
love
so
long
as
he
does
not
interfere
with
the
liberty
of
his
neighbor
the
phrase
every
man
for
himself
is
never
heard
but
we
are
members
one
of
another
is
the
common
principle
of
action
the
circles
are
formed
every
pair
of
hands
is
folded
and
bright
eyes
are
tightly
closed
to
keep
out
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
rest
of
it
while
children
and
teachers
sing
one
of
the
morning
hymns
birds
and
bees
and
flowers
every
happy
day
wake
to
greet
the
sunshine
thankful
for
its
ray
all
the
night
they
silent
sleeping
safe
and
warm
god
who
knows
and
loves
them
will
keep
them
from
all
harm
so
the
little
children
sleeping
all
the
night
wake
with
each
new
morning
fresh
and
sweet
and
bright
thanking
god
their
father
for
his
loving
care
with
their
songs
and
praises
they
make
the
day
more
fair
then
comes
a
trio
of
songs
with
cordial
handshakes
and
scores
of
kisses
wafted
from
merry
sunshine
follows
and
the
sun
encouraged
by
having
some
notice
taken
of
him
in
this
blind
and
stolid
world
shines
brighter
than
ever
the
song
thumbs
and
fingers
say
brings
two
thousand
fingers
fluttering
in
the
air
x
if
the
sum
seems
too
difficult
and
gives
the
kindergartners
an
opportunity
to
look
for
dirty
paws
and
preach
the
needed
sermon
it
is
benny
birthday
five
years
old
he
chooses
the
songs
he
likes
best
and
the
children
sing
them
with
friendly
energy
three
cheers
for
benny
only
three
now
says
the
kindergartner
they
are
given
with
an
enthusiasm
that
brings
the
neighbors
to
the
windows
and
benny
bursting
with
pride
blushes
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
the
children
stop
at
three
however
and
have
let
off
a
tremendous
amount
of
steam
in
the
operation
any
wholesome
device
which
accomplishes
this
result
is
worthy
of
being
perpetuated
a
draggled
forsaken
little
sneaks
in
the
door
with
a
pitiful
mew
i
sure
i
do
wonder
if
one
were
tired
of
life
this
would
be
just
the
place
to
take
a
fresh
start
the
children
break
into
the
song
i
love
little
pussy
her
coat
is
so
warm
and
the
kindergartner
asks
the
small
boy
with
the
great
lunch
pail
if
he
would
like
to
give
the
kitty
a
bit
of
something
to
eat
he
complies
with
the
utmost
solemnity
thinking
this
the
queerest
community
he
ever
saw
a
pigeon
appears
on
the
and
receives
his
morning
crumb
and
now
a
chord
from
the
piano
announces
a
change
of
programme
the
children
troop
to
their
respective
rooms
fairly
warmed
through
with
happiness
and
good
will
such
a
pleasant
morning
start
to
some
who
have
been
hustled
out
of
a
bed
that
held
several
too
many
in
the
night
washed
a
trifle
perhaps
and
sent
off
without
a
kiss
with
the
echo
of
a
sick
mother
wails
or
a
father
oaths
ringing
in
their
ears
after
a
few
minutes
of
cheerful
preparation
all
are
busily
at
work
two
divisions
have
gone
into
tiny
quiet
rooms
to
grapple
with
the
intricacies
of
mathematical
relations
a
small
boy
clad
mostly
in
red
woolen
suspenders
and
large
boots
is
passing
boxes
of
blocks
he
is
awkward
and
slow
the
teacher
could
do
it
more
quietly
and
more
quickly
but
the
kindergarten
is
a
school
of
experience
where
ease
comes
by
and
by
as
the
lovely
result
of
repeated
practice
we
hear
an
informal
talk
on
fractions
while
the
cube
is
divided
into
its
component
parts
and
then
see
a
building
exercise
by
direction
in
the
other
quiet
room
they
are
building
a
village
each
child
constructing
according
to
his
own
ideas
the
part
assigned
him
one
of
them
starts
a
song
and
they
all
join
in
oh
builders
we
would
like
to
be
so
willing
skilled
and
strong
and
while
we
work
so
cheerily
the
time
will
not
seem
long
if
we
all
do
our
parts
well
the
whole
is
sure
to
be
beautiful
says
the
teacher
one
rickety
badly
made
building
will
spoil
our
village
i
going
to
draw
a
blackboard
picture
of
the
children
who
live
in
the
village
johnny
you
have
blocks
enough
for
a
good
factory
and
jennie
has
enough
for
hers
why
do
you
club
together
and
make
a
very
large
fine
one
this
working
for
a
common
purpose
yet
with
due
respect
for
individuality
is
a
very
important
part
of
kindergarten
ethics
thus
each
child
learns
to
subordinate
himself
to
the
claims
and
needs
of
society
without
losing
himself
no
man
liveth
to
himself
is
the
underlying
principle
of
action
coming
back
to
the
main
room
we
find
one
division
weaving
bright
paper
strips
into
a
mat
of
contrasting
color
and
note
that
the
occupation
trains
the
sense
of
color
and
of
number
and
develops
dexterity
in
both
hands
but
what
is
this
merry
group
doing
in
the
farther
corner
these
are
the
babies
bless
them
and
they
are
modeling
in
clay
what
an
inspired
version
of
and
mud
pies
is
this
the
sleeves
are
pushed
up
showing
a
mark
of
white
arm
joining
little
brown
paws
what
fun
they
are
modeling
the
seals
at
the
cliff
house
for
this
chances
to
be
a
california
kindergarten
and
a
couple
of
who
have
strayed
into
this
retreat
not
because
there
was
any
room
for
them
here
but
because
there
was
any
room
for
them
anywhere
else
are
slapping
their
lumps
of
clay
with
all
their
might
and
then
rolling
it
into
caterpillars
and
snakes
this
last
is
not
very
educational
you
say
but
virtue
kindles
at
the
touch
of
joy
and
some
lasting
good
must
be
born
out
of
the
rational
happiness
that
surrounds
even
the
youngest
babies
in
the
kindergarten
the
in
this
room
represents
an
italian
or
chinese
vegetable
garden
the
children
have
rolled
and
leveled
the
surface
and
laid
it
off
in
square
beds
with
walks
between
the
planting
has
been
make
believe
a
different
kind
of
seed
in
each
bed
but
the
children
have
named
them
all
and
labeled
the
various
plats
with
pieces
of
paper
fastened
in
cleft
sticks
a
gardener
house
made
of
blocks
ornaments
one
corner
and
near
it
are
his
tools
hoe
rake
spade
all
made
in
cardboard
modeling
we
now
pass
in
one
corner
a
family
of
twenty
children
are
laying
designs
in
shining
rings
of
steel
and
as
the
graceful
curves
multiply
beneath
their
clever
fingers
the
kindergartner
is
telling
them
a
brief
story
of
a
little
boy
who
made
with
these
very
rings
a
design
for
a
beautiful
rose
window
which
was
copied
in
stained
glass
and
hung
in
a
great
stone
church
of
which
his
father
was
the
architect
another
group
of
children
is
folding
by
dictation
a
square
of
colored
paper
the
most
perfect
as
well
as
the
most
delicate
touch
is
needed
here
constant
reference
to
the
sharp
angle
blunt
angle
square
corner
and
right
angle
horizontal
and
vertical
lines
show
that
the
foundation
is
being
laid
for
a
future
clear
and
practical
knowledge
of
geometry
though
the
word
itself
is
never
mentioned
there
is
one
unhappy
little
boy
in
this
class
he
has
broken
the
law
in
some
way
and
he
has
no
work
that
is
a
strange
idea
said
the
woman
visitor
in
my
time
work
was
given
to
us
as
a
punishment
and
it
seemed
a
most
excellent
plan
we
look
at
it
in
another
way
said
the
kindergartner
smiling
you
see
work
is
really
the
great
panacea
the
best
thing
in
the
world
we
are
always
trying
to
train
the
children
to
a
love
of
industry
and
helpful
occupation
so
we
give
work
as
a
reward
and
take
it
away
as
a
punishment
we
pass
into
the
sunny
upper
hall
and
find
some
children
surrounding
a
large
the
exercise
is
just
finished
and
we
gaze
upon
a
miniature
representation
of
the
cliff
house
embankment
and
curving
road
a
section
of
beach
with
people
standing
wooden
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
a
noah
ark
a
section
of
ocean
and
a
perfect
seal
rock
made
of
clay
run
timmy
please
and
ask
miss
ellen
if
the
seals
are
ready
timmy
flies
presently
the
babies
troop
up
each
carrying
a
precious
seal
extended
on
two
tiny
hands
or
reposing
in
apron
they
are
all
bursting
with
importance
of
course
the
small
jonah
of
the
flock
tumbles
up
the
stairs
bumps
his
nose
and
breaks
his
treasure
there
is
an
agonized
wail
bust
my
seal
some
one
springs
to
the
rescue
the
seal
is
patched
tears
are
dried
and
harmony
is
restored
the
animals
are
piled
on
the
rocks
in
realistic
confusion
and
another
class
comes
out
with
paper
fishes
to
be
arranged
in
the
waves
of
sand
later
on
the
sound
of
a
piano
invites
us
to
witness
the
kindergarten
through
kindergarten
play
the
child
comes
to
know
the
external
world
the
physical
qualities
of
the
objects
which
surround
him
their
motions
actions
and
reactions
upon
each
other
and
the
relations
of
these
phenomena
to
himself
a
knowledge
which
forms
the
basis
of
that
which
will
be
his
permanent
stock
in
life
the
child
fancy
is
healthily
fed
by
images
from
outer
life
and
his
curiosity
by
new
glimpses
of
knowledge
from
the
world
around
him
there
are
plays
and
plays
the
ordinary
unguided
games
of
childhood
are
not
to
be
confounded
for
an
instant
with
the
genuine
kindergarten
plays
which
have
a
far
deeper
significance
than
is
apparent
to
the
superficial
observer
take
the
simplest
circle
game
it
illustrates
the
whole
duty
of
a
good
citizen
in
a
republic
anybody
can
spoil
it
yet
nobody
can
play
it
alone
anybody
can
hinder
its
success
yet
no
one
can
get
credit
for
making
it
succeed
the
play
is
over
the
children
march
back
to
their
seats
and
settle
themselves
to
another
period
of
work
which
will
last
until
noon
we
watch
the
bright
faces
cheerful
friendly
chatter
the
busy
figures
hovering
over
pleasant
tasks
and
feel
that
it
has
been
good
to
pass
a
morning
in
this
republic
of
childhood
i
have
given
you
but
a
tithe
of
the
whole
argument
the
veriest
view
neither
is
it
romance
it
is
simple
truth
and
that
being
the
case
how
can
we
afford
to
keep
froebel
and
his
wonderful
influence
on
childhood
out
of
a
system
of
free
education
which
has
for
its
aim
the
development
of
a
free
useful
people
it
is
too
great
a
factor
to
be
disregarded
and
the
coming
years
will
prove
it
so
for
the
value
of
such
schools
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
theory
they
have
been
tested
by
experience
and
have
won
favor
wherever
they
have
been
given
a
fair
trial
but
how
important
a
work
they
have
to
do
in
our
scheme
of
public
education
is
clear
only
when
we
consider
the
conditions
which
our
public
schools
must
meet
nowadays
on
the
theory
upon
which
the
state
undertakes
the
education
of
its
youth
at
all
the
necessity
of
preparing
them
for
intelligent
citizenship
a
community
might
better
economize
if
economize
it
must
anywhere
else
than
on
the
beginning
an
enormous
immigrant
population
is
pressing
upon
us
the
kindergarten
reaches
this
class
with
great
power
and
increases
the
insufficient
education
within
the
reach
of
the
children
who
must
leave
school
for
work
at
the
age
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
it
increases
it
too
by
a
kind
of
training
which
the
child
gets
from
no
other
schooling
and
brings
him
under
influences
which
are
no
small
addition
to
the
sum
total
of
good
in
his
life
the
entire
pedagogical
world
watches
with
interest
the
educational
awakening
of
which
the
kindergarten
has
been
the
dawn
if
people
really
want
to
make
the
experiment
if
parents
and
are
anxious
to
have
for
their
younger
children
what
seems
so
beneficent
a
training
then
let
them
accept
no
compromises
but
after
taking
the
children
at
a
proper
age
see
to
it
that
they
get
pure
kindergarten
true
kindergarten
and
but
kindergarten
till
they
enter
the
primary
school
then
they
will
be
prepared
for
study
and
begin
it
with
infinite
zest
because
they
comprehend
its
meaning
having
had
that
beautiful
beginning
every
later
step
will
seem
glad
to
the
child
he
will
not
see
knowledge
through
a
glass
darkly
but
face
to
face
in
her
most
charming
aspect
other
people
children
where
is
thy
brother
abel
we
will
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
rights
of
our
own
children
are
secured
but
though
such
security
betokens
an
admirable
state
of
affairs
it
does
not
cover
the
whole
ground
there
are
always
the
other
people
children
the
still
small
voice
is
forever
saying
where
is
thy
brother
abel
there
are
many
matters
to
be
settled
with
regard
to
this
brother
abel
and
we
differ
considerably
as
to
the
exact
degree
of
our
responsibility
towards
him
some
people
believe
in
giving
him
the
full
privileges
of
brotherhood
in
sharing
alike
with
him
in
every
particular
and
others
insist
that
he
is
no
brother
of
theirs
at
all
let
the
nationalists
and
socialists
and
all
the
other
reformers
decide
this
vexed
question
as
best
they
can
particularly
with
regard
to
the
abels
meanwhile
there
are
a
few
sweet
and
wholesome
services
we
can
render
to
the
brother
abels
who
are
not
big
enough
to
be
nationalists
and
socialists
nor
strong
enough
to
fight
for
their
own
rights
among
these
kindly
offices
to
be
rendered
these
practical
agencies
for
making
abel
a
happy
and
consequently
a
better
little
brother
we
may
surely
count
the
free
kindergarten
my
mind
convinces
me
that
the
kindergarten
idea
is
true
not
a
perfect
thing
as
yet
but
something
on
the
road
to
perfection
something
full
of
vitality
and
power
to
grow
and
my
heart
tells
me
that
there
is
no
more
beautiful
or
encouraging
work
in
the
universe
than
this
of
taking
hold
of
the
unclaimed
babies
and
giving
them
a
bit
of
motherliness
to
remember
the
free
kindergarten
is
the
mother
of
the
motherless
the
father
of
the
fatherless
it
is
the
great
clean
broom
that
sweeps
the
streets
of
its
parentless
or
worse
than
parentless
children
to
the
increased
comfort
of
the
children
and
to
the
prodigious
advantage
of
the
street
we
are
very
much
interested
in
the
cleaning
of
city
streets
and
well
we
may
be
but
up
to
this
day
a
larger
number
of
men
and
women
have
concerned
themselves
actively
about
sweeping
them
of
dust
and
dirt
than
of
sweeping
them
free
of
these
children
if
dirt
is
misplaced
matter
then
what
do
you
call
a
child
who
sits
eternally
on
the
curbstones
and
in
the
gutters
of
our
districts
i
believe
that
since
the
great
teacher
of
humanity
spoke
those
simple
words
of
eternal
tenderness
that
voiced
the
mother
side
of
the
divine
nature
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
forbid
them
not
i
believe
that
nothing
more
heartfelt
more
effectual
has
come
ringing
down
to
us
through
the
centuries
than
froebel
inspired
and
inspiring
call
come
let
us
live
with
the
children
this
work
in
the
best
and
the
highest
sense
as
well
as
the
most
practical
it
is
true
the
kindergartner
has
the
child
in
her
care
but
three
or
four
hours
a
day
it
is
true
in
most
instances
that
the
home
influences
are
all
against
her
it
is
true
that
the
very
people
for
whom
she
is
working
do
not
always
appreciate
her
efforts
it
is
true
that
in
many
cases
the
child
has
been
born
wrong
and
to
accomplish
any
radical
reform
she
ought
to
have
begun
with
his
grandfather
it
is
true
she
makes
failures
now
and
then
and
has
to
leave
the
sorry
task
seemingly
unperformed
giving
into
the
mighty
hand
of
one
who
bringeth
order
out
of
chaos
that
which
her
finite
strength
has
failed
to
compass
she
hears
discouraging
words
sometimes
but
they
do
not
make
a
profound
impression
when
she
sees
the
weary
yet
beautiful
days
go
by
bringing
with
them
hourly
rewards
greater
than
speech
can
testify
she
sees
homes
changing
slowly
but
surely
under
her
quiet
influence
and
that
of
those
home
missionaries
the
children
themselves
she
gets
love
in
full
measure
where
she
least
expected
so
radiant
a
flower
to
bloom
she
receives
gratitude
from
some
parents
far
beyond
what
she
is
conscious
of
deserving
she
sees
the
ancient
and
respectable
being
driven
from
many
of
the
homes
where
he
has
reigned
supreme
for
years
she
sees
brutal
punishments
giving
place
to
sweeter
methods
and
kinder
treatment
and
she
is
too
happy
and
too
grateful
for
these
and
more
encouragements
to
be
disheartened
by
any
cynical
dissertations
on
the
determination
of
the
world
to
go
wrong
and
the
impossibility
of
preventing
it
it
is
easier
in
my
opinion
to
raise
money
for
and
interest
the
general
man
or
woman
in
the
free
kindergarten
than
in
any
other
single
charity
it
is
always
comparatively
easy
to
convince
people
of
a
truth
but
it
is
much
easier
to
convince
them
of
some
truths
than
of
others
if
you
wish
to
found
a
library
build
a
hospital
establish
a
open
a
bureau
for
woman
work
you
are
obliged
to
argue
more
or
less
but
if
you
want
money
for
neglected
children
you
have
generally
only
to
state
the
case
everybody
agrees
in
the
obvious
propositions
an
ounce
of
prevention
as
the
twig
is
bent
the
child
is
father
to
the
man
train
up
a
child
a
stitch
in
time
prevention
is
better
than
cure
where
the
lambs
go
the
flocks
will
follow
it
is
easier
to
form
than
to
reform
and
so
on
proverbs
multiply
the
advantages
of
preventive
work
are
so
palpable
that
as
soon
as
you
broach
the
matter
you
ought
to
find
your
case
proved
and
judgment
awarded
to
the
plaintiff
before
you
open
your
lips
to
plead
the
whole
matter
is
crystal
clear
for
happily
where
the
protection
of
children
is
concerned
there
is
not
any
side
to
the
argument
we
need
the
public
kindergarten
educationally
as
the
vestibule
to
our
school
work
we
need
it
as
a
philanthropic
agent
leading
the
child
gently
into
right
habits
of
thought
speech
and
action
from
the
beginning
we
need
it
to
help
in
the
absorption
and
amalgamation
of
our
foreign
element
for
the
social
training
the
opportunity
for
coöperation
and
the
purely
republican
form
of
government
in
the
kindergarten
make
it
of
great
value
in
the
development
of
the
as
well
as
those
of
the
individual
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
this
side
of
froebel
educational
idea
were
more
insisted
on
throughout
our
common
school
system
we
should
be
making
better
citizens
and
no
worse
scholars
if
we
believe
in
the
kindergarten
if
we
wish
it
to
become
a
part
of
our
educational
system
we
have
only
to
let
that
belief
that
desire
crystallize
into
action
but
we
must
not
leave
it
for
somebody
else
to
do
it
is
clearly
every
mother
business
and
business
spinsters
and
bachelors
are
not
exempt
for
they
know
not
in
what
hour
they
may
be
snatched
from
sweet
liberty
and
delivered
into
sweeter
slavery
it
is
a
lawyer
business
for
though
it
will
make
the
world
better
it
will
not
do
it
soon
enough
to
lessen
litigation
in
his
time
it
is
surely
the
doctor
business
and
the
minister
and
that
of
the
business
man
it
is
in
fact
business
the
beauty
of
this
kindergarten
subject
is
its
kaleidoscopic
character
it
presents
like
all
truth
so
many
sides
that
you
can
give
every
one
that
which
he
likes
or
is
fitted
to
receive
take
the
aggressively
man
who
thinks
our
general
scheme
of
education
unprofitable
show
him
the
kindergarten
plan
of
manual
training
he
rubs
his
hands
ah
that
common
sense
he
says
i
do
believe
in
your
colleges
i
never
went
to
college
you
may
count
on
me
give
the
man
of
esthetic
taste
an
idea
of
what
the
kindergarten
does
in
developing
the
sense
of
beauty
show
him
in
what
way
it
is
a
primary
art
school
explain
to
the
musician
your
feeling
about
the
influence
of
music
show
the
people
that
in
the
kindergarten
the
body
has
an
equal
chance
with
mind
and
heart
tell
the
man
some
sad
incident
related
to
you
by
one
of
your
kindergartners
and
as
soon
as
he
can
see
through
his
tears
show
him
your
subscription
book
give
the
woman
who
can
not
reason
and
there
are
such
an
opportunity
to
feel
there
is
more
than
one
way
of
imbibing
truth
fortunately
and
the
brain
is
not
the
only
avenue
to
knowledge
finally
take
the
utter
skeptic
into
the
kindergarten
and
let
the
children
convert
him
it
commonly
is
a
him
by
the
way
the
of
the
universe
is
generally
sound
on
this
subject
but
getting
money
and
opening
kindergartens
are
not
the
only
cares
of
a
kindergarten
association
at
least
there
are
other
grave
responsibilities
which
no
other
organization
is
so
well
fitted
to
assume
these
are
the
persistent
working
upon
school
boards
until
they
adopt
the
kindergarten
and
much
more
delicate
and
difficult
the
protection
of
its
interests
after
it
is
adopted
the
opening
of
kindergartens
in
orphanages
and
refuges
where
they
prove
the
most
blessed
instrumentality
for
good
the
spreading
of
such
clear
knowledge
and
intelligent
insight
into
the
kindergarten
as
shall
prevent
it
from
deterioration
the
insistence
upon
kindergartners
properly
trained
by
properly
qualified
training
teachers
the
gentle
mothering
and
inspiring
and
helping
those
kindergartners
to
realize
their
fair
ideals
for
froebel
method
is
a
growing
thing
and
she
who
does
not
grow
with
it
is
a
hopeless
failure
the
proper
equipment
and
furnishing
of
so
that
the
public
may
have
good
before
its
eyes
the
insistence
upon
the
ultimate
ideals
of
the
method
as
well
as
upon
details
and
technicalities
that
is
showing
people
its
soul
instead
of
forever
rattling
its
dry
bones
and
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
heaviest
of
the
work
falls
upon
the
kindergartner
that
is
why
i
am
convinced
that
we
should
do
everything
that
sympathy
and
honor
and
money
can
do
to
exalt
the
office
so
that
women
of
birth
breeding
culture
and
genius
shall
gravitate
to
it
the
kindergartner
it
is
who
living
with
the
children
can
make
her
work
an
integral
part
of
the
neighborhood
the
centre
of
its
best
life
she
it
is
often
who
must
hold
husband
to
wife
and
parent
to
child
she
it
is
after
all
who
must
interpret
the
aims
of
the
association
and
translate
its
noble
theories
into
practice
ay
and
there
the
rub
she
it
is
who
must
harmonize
great
ideal
principles
with
real
and
sometimes
sorry
conditions
a
kindergarten
association
stands
for
certain
things
before
the
community
it
is
the
kindergartner
alone
who
can
prove
the
truth
who
can
substantiate
the
argument
who
can
show
the
facts
there
is
no
more
difficult
vocation
in
the
universe
and
no
more
honorable
or
sacred
one
if
a
kindergartner
is
looked
upon
or
paid
or
treated
as
a
nursery
maid
her
ranks
will
gradually
be
recruited
from
that
source
the
ideal
teacher
of
little
children
is
not
born
we
have
to
struggle
on
as
best
we
can
without
her
she
would
be
born
if
we
knew
how
to
conceive
her
how
to
cherish
her
she
needs
the
strength
of
vulcan
and
the
delicacy
of
ariel
she
needs
a
child
heart
a
woman
heart
a
heart
in
one
she
needs
clear
judgment
and
ready
sympathy
strength
of
will
equal
elasticity
keen
insight
oversight
the
buoyancy
of
hope
the
serenity
of
faith
the
tenderness
of
patience
the
hope
of
the
world
lies
in
the
children
when
we
are
better
mothers
when
men
are
better
fathers
there
will
be
better
children
and
a
better
world
the
sooner
we
feel
the
value
of
beginnings
the
sooner
we
realize
that
we
can
put
bunglers
and
botchers
anywhere
else
better
than
in
nursery
kindergarten
or
primary
school
there
are
no
three
places
in
the
universe
so
big
with
fate
the
sooner
we
shall
arrive
at
better
results
i
am
afraid
it
is
chiefly
women
work
of
course
men
can
be
useful
in
many
little
ways
such
as
giving
money
and
getting
other
people
to
give
it
in
influencing
legislation
interviewing
school
boards
securing
buildings
presiding
over
meetings
and
giving
a
general
air
of
strength
and
solidity
to
the
undertaking
but
the
chief
plotting
and
planning
and
working
out
of
details
must
be
done
by
women
the
male
genius
of
humanity
begets
the
ideas
of
which
each
century
has
need
at
least
it
is
so
said
and
i
have
never
had
the
courage
to
deny
it
or
the
time
to
look
it
up
but
the
female
genius
i
am
sure
has
to
work
them
out
and
to
help
is
to
do
the
work
of
the
world
if
one
can
give
money
if
only
a
single
subscription
let
her
give
it
if
she
can
give
time
let
her
give
that
if
she
has
no
time
for
absolute
work
perhaps
she
has
time
for
the
right
word
spoken
in
due
season
failing
all
else
there
is
no
woman
alive
worthy
the
name
who
can
not
give
a
generous
heartthrob
a
warm
a
sunny
helpful
smile
a
ready
tear
to
a
cause
that
concerns
itself
with
childhood
as
a
for
her
own
children
a
pledge
for
those
the
hidden
future
may
bring
her
or
a
consolation
for
empty
arms
there
is
always
time
to
do
the
thing
that
to
be
that
be
done
and
for
that
matter
who
shall
fix
the
limit
to
our
powers
of
helpfulness
it
is
the
unused
pump
that
wheezes
if
our
bounty
be
dry
cross
and
reluctant
it
is
because
we
do
not
continually
summon
and
draw
it
out
but
if
like
the
patriarch
jacob
our
well
is
deep
it
can
not
be
exhausted
while
we
draw
upon
it
it
draws
upon
the
unspent
springs
the
the
clouds
the
air
and
the
sea
and
the
great
source
of
power
must
itself
suspend
and
be
bankrupt
before
ours
can
fail
the
kindergarten
is
not
for
the
poor
child
alone
a
charity
neither
is
it
for
the
rich
child
alone
a
luxury
corrective
or
antidote
but
the
ideas
of
which
it
tries
to
be
the
expression
are
the
proper
atmosphere
for
every
child
it
is
a
promise
of
health
happiness
and
usefulness
to
many
an
unfortunate
little
waif
whose
earthly
inheritance
is
utter
blackness
and
whose
moral
blight
can
be
outgrown
and
succeeded
by
a
development
of
intelligence
and
love
of
virtue
the
child
of
poverty
and
vice
has
still
within
him
however
overlaid
by
the
sins
of
ancestry
a
germ
of
good
that
is
capable
of
growth
if
reached
in
time
let
us
stretch
out
a
tender
strong
hand
and
touching
that
poor
germ
of
good
lifting
its
feeble
head
in
a
wilderness
of
evil
help
it
to
live
and
thrive
and
grow
