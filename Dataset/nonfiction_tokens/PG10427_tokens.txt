on
the
study
of
natural
history
superstition
science
thoughts
in
a
how
to
study
natural
history
the
natural
theology
of
the
future
on
i
am
not
sure
that
the
subject
of
my
address
is
rightly
chosen
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ought
not
to
have
postponed
a
question
of
mere
natural
history
to
speak
to
you
as
scientific
men
on
the
questions
of
life
and
death
which
have
been
forced
upon
us
by
the
awful
warning
of
an
illustrious
personage
illness
of
preventible
disease
its
frightful
prevalency
of
the
persons
who
are
said
to
have
died
of
fever
alone
since
the
prince
consort
death
ten
years
ago
of
the
remedies
of
drainage
of
sewage
disinfection
and
utilisation
and
of
the
assistance
which
you
as
a
body
of
scientific
men
can
give
to
any
effort
towards
saving
the
lives
and
health
of
our
from
those
unseen
poisons
which
lurk
like
wild
beasts
couched
in
the
jungle
ready
to
spring
at
any
moment
on
the
unsuspecting
the
innocent
the
helpless
of
all
this
i
longed
to
speak
but
i
thought
it
best
only
to
hint
at
it
and
leave
the
question
to
your
common
sense
and
your
humanity
taking
for
granted
that
your
minds
like
the
minds
of
all
englishmen
have
been
of
late
painfully
awakened
to
its
importance
it
seemed
to
me
almost
an
impertinence
to
say
more
in
a
city
of
whose
local
circumstances
i
know
little
or
nothing
as
an
old
sanitary
reformer
practical
as
well
as
theoretical
i
am
but
too
well
aware
of
the
difficulties
which
beset
any
complete
scheme
of
drainage
especially
in
an
ancient
city
like
this
where
men
are
paying
the
penalty
of
their
predecessors
ignorance
and
dwelling
whether
they
choose
or
not
over
fifteen
centuries
of
accumulated
dirt
and
therefore
taking
for
granted
that
there
is
energy
and
intellect
enough
in
winchester
to
conquer
these
difficulties
in
due
time
i
go
on
to
ask
you
to
consider
for
a
time
a
subject
which
is
growing
more
and
more
important
and
interesting
a
subject
the
study
of
which
will
do
much
towards
raising
the
field
naturalist
from
a
mere
collector
of
specimens
as
he
was
twenty
years
ago
to
a
philosopher
elucidating
some
of
the
grandest
problems
i
mean
the
infant
science
of
the
science
which
treats
of
the
distribution
of
plants
and
animals
over
the
globe
and
the
cause
of
that
distribution
i
doubt
not
that
there
are
many
here
who
know
far
more
about
the
subject
than
i
who
are
far
better
read
than
i
am
in
the
works
of
forbes
darwin
wallace
hooker
moritz
wagner
and
the
other
illustrious
men
who
have
written
on
it
but
i
may
perhaps
give
a
few
hints
which
will
be
of
use
to
the
younger
members
of
this
society
and
will
point
out
to
them
how
to
get
a
new
relish
for
the
pursuit
of
field
science
then
begins
with
asking
every
plant
or
animal
you
meet
large
or
small
not
merely
what
is
your
name
that
is
the
collector
and
classifier
duty
and
a
most
necessary
duty
it
is
and
one
to
be
performed
with
the
most
conscientious
patience
and
accuracy
so
that
a
sound
foundation
may
be
built
for
future
speculations
but
young
naturalists
should
act
not
merely
as
nature
registrars
and
but
as
her
policemen
and
gamekeepers
and
ask
everything
they
meet
how
did
you
get
there
by
what
road
did
you
come
what
was
your
last
place
of
abode
and
now
you
are
here
how
do
you
get
your
living
are
you
and
your
children
thriving
like
decent
people
who
can
take
care
of
themselves
or
growing
pauperised
and
degraded
and
dying
out
not
that
we
have
a
fear
of
your
becoming
a
dangerous
class
madame
nature
allows
no
dangerous
classes
in
the
modern
sense
she
has
doubtless
for
some
wise
reason
no
mercy
for
the
weak
she
rewards
each
organism
according
to
its
works
and
if
anything
grows
too
weak
or
stupid
to
take
care
of
itself
she
gives
it
its
due
deserts
by
letting
it
die
and
disappear
so
you
plant
or
you
animal
are
you
among
the
strong
the
successful
the
multiplying
the
colonising
or
are
you
among
the
weak
the
failing
the
dwindling
the
doomed
these
questions
may
seem
somewhat
rude
but
you
may
comfort
yourself
by
the
thought
that
plants
and
animals
though
they
deserve
all
kindness
all
admiration
deserve
no
courtesy
at
least
in
this
respect
for
they
are
one
and
all
wherever
you
find
them
vagrants
and
landlopers
intruders
and
conquerors
who
have
got
where
they
happen
to
be
simply
by
the
law
of
the
strongest
generally
not
without
a
little
robbery
and
murder
they
have
no
right
save
that
of
possession
the
same
by
which
the
puffin
turns
out
the
old
rabbits
eats
the
young
ones
and
then
lays
her
eggs
in
the
simply
because
she
can
now
you
will
see
at
once
that
such
a
course
of
questioning
will
call
out
a
great
many
curious
and
interesting
answers
if
you
can
only
get
the
things
to
tell
you
their
story
as
you
always
may
if
you
will
them
long
enough
and
will
lead
you
into
many
subjects
beside
mere
botany
or
entomology
so
various
indeed
are
the
subjects
which
you
will
thus
start
that
i
can
only
hint
at
them
now
in
the
most
cursory
fashion
at
the
outset
you
will
soon
find
yourself
involved
in
chemical
and
meteorological
questions
as
for
instance
when
you
ask
how
is
it
that
i
find
one
flora
on
the
another
on
the
sandstone
another
on
the
chalk
and
another
on
the
gravelly
strata
the
usual
answer
would
be
i
presume
if
we
could
work
it
out
by
twenty
years
experiment
such
as
lawes
of
rothampsted
has
been
making
on
the
growth
of
grasses
and
leguminous
plants
in
different
soils
and
under
different
manures
the
usual
answer
i
say
would
be
because
we
plants
want
such
and
such
mineral
constituents
in
our
woody
fibre
again
because
we
want
a
certain
amount
of
moisture
at
a
certain
period
of
the
year
or
perhaps
simply
because
the
mechanical
arrangement
of
the
particles
of
a
certain
soil
happens
to
suit
the
shape
of
our
roots
and
of
their
stomata
sometimes
you
will
get
an
answer
quickly
enough
sometimes
not
if
you
ask
for
instance
asplenium
viride
how
it
contrives
to
grow
plentifully
in
the
craven
of
yorkshire
down
to
or
feet
above
the
sea
while
in
snowdon
it
dislikes
growing
lower
than
feet
and
is
not
plentiful
even
there
it
will
reply
because
in
the
craven
i
can
get
as
much
carbonic
acid
as
i
want
from
the
decomposing
limestone
while
on
the
snowdon
silurian
i
get
very
little
and
i
have
to
make
it
up
by
clinging
to
the
mountain
tops
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
rainfall
but
if
you
ask
polypodium
calcareum
how
is
it
you
choose
only
to
grow
on
limestone
while
polypodium
dryopteris
of
which
i
suspect
you
are
only
a
variety
is
ready
to
grow
anywhere
polypodium
calcareum
will
refuse
as
yet
to
answer
a
word
again
i
can
only
give
you
the
merest
string
of
hints
you
will
find
in
your
questionings
that
many
plants
and
animals
have
no
reason
at
all
to
show
why
they
should
be
in
one
place
and
not
in
another
save
the
very
sound
reason
for
the
latter
which
was
suggested
to
me
once
by
a
great
naturalist
i
was
asking
why
do
i
find
such
and
such
a
species
in
my
parish
while
it
is
plentiful
a
few
miles
off
in
exactly
the
same
soil
and
he
answered
for
the
same
reason
that
you
are
not
in
america
because
you
have
not
got
there
which
answer
threw
to
me
a
flood
of
light
on
this
whole
science
things
are
often
where
they
are
simply
because
they
happen
to
have
got
there
and
not
elsewhere
but
they
must
have
got
there
by
some
means
and
those
means
i
want
young
naturalists
to
discover
at
least
to
guess
at
a
species
for
instance
and
i
suspect
it
is
a
common
case
with
insects
may
abound
in
a
single
spot
simply
because
long
years
ago
a
single
brood
of
eggs
happened
to
hatch
at
a
time
when
eggs
of
other
species
who
would
have
competed
against
them
for
food
did
not
hatch
and
they
may
remain
confined
to
that
spot
though
there
is
plenty
of
food
for
them
outside
it
simply
because
they
do
not
increase
fast
enough
to
require
to
spread
out
in
search
of
more
food
thus
i
should
explain
a
case
which
i
heard
of
lately
of
anthocera
trifolii
abundant
for
years
in
one
corner
of
a
certain
field
and
only
there
while
there
was
just
as
much
trefoil
all
round
for
its
larvae
as
there
was
in
the
selected
spot
i
can
i
say
only
give
hints
but
they
will
suffice
i
hope
to
show
the
path
of
thought
into
which
i
want
young
naturalists
to
turn
their
minds
or
again
you
will
have
to
inquire
whether
the
species
has
not
been
prevented
from
spreading
by
some
natural
barrier
wallace
whom
you
all
of
course
know
has
shown
in
his
malay
archipelago
that
a
strait
of
deep
sea
can
act
as
such
a
barrier
between
species
moritz
wagner
has
shown
that
in
the
case
of
insects
a
broad
river
may
divide
two
species
of
beetles
or
a
very
narrow
two
species
of
moths
again
another
cause
and
a
most
common
one
is
that
the
plants
can
not
spread
because
they
find
the
ground
beyond
them
already
occupied
by
other
plants
who
will
not
tolerate
a
fresh
mouth
having
only
just
enough
to
feed
themselves
take
the
case
of
saxifraga
hypnoides
and
umbrosa
london
pride
they
are
two
especially
strong
species
they
show
that
hypnoides
especially
by
their
power
of
sporting
of
diverging
into
varieties
they
show
it
equally
by
their
power
of
thriving
anywhere
if
they
can
only
get
there
they
will
grow
both
in
my
sandy
garden
under
a
rainfall
of
only
inches
more
luxuriantly
than
in
their
native
mountains
under
a
rainfall
of
or
inches
then
how
is
it
that
hypnoides
can
not
get
down
off
the
mountains
and
that
umbrosa
though
in
kerry
it
has
got
off
the
mountains
and
down
to
the
level
exterminating
i
suspect
many
species
in
its
progress
yet
can
not
get
across
county
cork
the
only
answer
is
i
believe
that
both
species
are
continually
trying
to
go
ahead
but
that
the
other
plants
already
in
front
of
them
are
too
strong
for
them
and
massacre
their
infants
as
soon
as
born
and
this
brings
us
to
another
curious
question
the
sudden
and
abundant
appearance
of
plants
like
the
foxglove
and
epilobium
angustifolium
in
spots
where
they
have
never
been
seen
before
are
there
seeds
as
some
think
dormant
in
the
ground
or
are
the
seeds
which
have
germinated
fresh
ones
wafted
thither
by
wind
or
otherwise
and
only
able
to
germinate
in
that
one
spot
because
there
the
soil
is
clear
general
monro
now
famous
for
his
unequalled
memoir
on
the
bamboos
holds
to
the
latter
theory
he
pointed
out
to
me
that
the
epilobium
seeds
being
feathered
could
travel
with
the
wind
that
the
plant
always
made
its
appearance
first
on
new
banks
landslips
clearings
where
it
had
nothing
to
compete
against
and
that
the
foxglove
did
the
same
true
and
most
painfully
true
in
the
case
of
thistles
and
groundsels
but
foxglove
seeds
though
minute
would
hardly
be
carried
by
the
wind
any
more
than
those
of
the
white
clover
which
comes
up
so
abundantly
in
drained
fens
adhuc
sub
judice
lis
est
and
i
wish
some
young
naturalists
would
work
carefully
at
the
solution
by
experiment
which
is
the
most
sure
way
to
find
out
anything
but
in
researches
in
this
direction
they
will
find
puzzles
enough
i
will
give
them
one
which
i
shall
be
most
thankful
to
hear
they
have
solved
within
the
next
seven
years
how
is
it
that
we
find
certain
plants
namely
the
thrift
and
the
scurvy
grass
abundant
on
the
and
common
on
certain
but
nowhere
between
the
two
answer
me
that
for
i
have
looked
at
the
fact
for
years
before
behind
sideways
upside
down
and
inside
out
and
i
can
not
understand
it
but
all
these
questions
and
especially
i
suspect
that
last
one
ought
to
lead
the
young
student
up
to
the
great
and
complex
question
how
were
these
islands
with
plants
and
animals
after
the
long
and
wholesale
catastrophe
of
the
glacial
epoch
i
presume
you
all
know
and
will
agree
that
the
whole
of
these
islands
north
of
the
thames
save
certain
were
buried
for
long
ages
under
an
icy
sea
from
whence
did
vegetable
and
animal
life
crawl
back
to
the
land
as
it
rose
again
and
cover
its
mantle
of
glacial
drift
with
fresh
life
and
verdure
now
let
me
give
you
a
few
prolegomena
on
this
matter
you
must
study
the
plants
of
course
species
by
species
take
cybele
britannica
and
moore
cybele
hibernica
and
let
as
matthew
arnold
would
say
your
thought
play
freely
about
them
look
carefully
too
in
the
case
of
each
species
at
the
note
on
its
distribution
which
you
will
find
appended
in
bentham
handbook
and
in
hooker
student
flora
get
all
the
help
you
can
if
you
wish
to
work
the
subject
out
from
foreign
botanists
both
european
and
american
and
i
think
that
on
the
whole
you
will
come
to
some
such
theory
as
this
for
a
general
starling
platform
we
do
not
owe
our
flora
i
must
keep
to
the
flora
just
now
to
so
many
different
regions
or
types
as
watson
conceives
but
to
three
namely
an
european
or
germanic
flora
from
the
an
atlantic
flora
from
the
a
northern
flora
from
the
north
these
three
invaded
us
after
the
glacial
epoch
and
our
general
flora
is
their
result
but
this
will
cause
you
much
trouble
before
you
go
a
step
farther
you
will
have
to
eliminate
from
all
your
calculations
most
of
the
plants
which
watson
calls
glareal
found
in
cultivated
ground
about
habitations
and
what
their
limit
may
be
i
think
we
never
shall
know
but
of
this
we
may
be
sure
that
just
as
invading
armies
always
bring
with
them
in
forage
or
otherwise
some
plants
from
their
own
country
just
as
the
cossacks
in
brought
more
than
one
russian
plant
through
germany
into
france
just
as
you
have
already
a
crop
of
north
german
plants
upon
the
of
france
thus
do
conquering
races
bring
new
plants
the
romans
during
their
or
years
of
occupation
and
civilisation
must
have
brought
more
species
i
believe
than
i
dare
mention
i
suspect
them
of
having
brought
not
merely
the
common
hedge
elm
of
the
south
not
merely
the
three
species
of
nettle
but
all
our
red
poppies
and
a
great
number
of
the
weeds
which
are
common
in
our
cornfields
and
when
we
add
to
them
the
plants
which
may
have
been
brought
by
returning
crusaders
and
pilgrims
by
monks
from
every
part
of
europe
by
flemings
or
other
dealers
in
foreign
wool
we
have
to
cut
a
huge
cantle
out
of
our
indigenous
flora
only
having
no
records
we
hardly
know
where
and
what
to
cut
out
and
can
only
we
elder
ones
recommend
the
subject
to
the
notice
of
the
younger
botanists
that
they
may
work
it
out
after
our
work
is
done
of
course
these
plants
introduced
by
man
if
they
are
cut
out
must
be
cut
out
of
only
one
of
the
floras
namely
the
european
for
they
probably
came
from
the
by
whatever
means
they
came
that
european
flora
invaded
us
i
presume
immediately
after
the
glacial
epoch
at
a
time
when
france
and
england
were
united
and
the
german
ocean
a
mere
network
of
rivers
which
emptied
into
the
deep
sea
between
scotland
and
scandinavia
and
here
i
must
add
that
endless
questions
of
interest
will
arise
to
those
who
will
study
not
merely
the
invasion
of
that
truly
european
flora
but
the
invasion
of
reptiles
insects
and
birds
especially
birds
of
passage
which
must
have
followed
it
as
soon
as
the
land
was
sufficiently
covered
with
vegetation
to
support
life
whole
volumes
remain
to
be
written
on
this
subject
i
trust
that
some
of
your
younger
members
may
live
to
write
one
of
them
the
way
to
begin
will
be
to
compare
the
flora
and
fauna
of
this
part
of
england
very
carefully
with
that
of
the
southern
and
eastern
counties
and
then
to
compare
them
again
with
the
fauna
and
flora
of
france
belgium
and
holland
as
for
the
atlantic
flora
you
will
have
to
decide
for
yourselves
whether
you
accept
or
not
the
theory
of
a
sunken
atlantic
continent
i
confess
that
all
objections
to
that
theory
however
astounding
it
may
seem
are
outweighed
in
my
mind
by
a
host
of
facts
which
i
can
explain
by
no
other
theory
but
you
must
judge
for
yourselves
and
to
do
so
you
must
study
carefully
the
distribution
of
heaths
both
in
europe
and
at
the
cape
and
their
beyond
the
ural
mountains
and
in
america
save
in
labrador
where
the
common
ling
an
older
and
less
specialised
form
exists
you
must
consider
too
the
plants
common
to
the
azores
portugal
the
west
of
england
ireland
and
the
western
hebrides
in
so
doing
young
naturalists
will
at
least
find
proofs
of
a
change
in
the
distribution
of
land
and
water
which
will
utterly
astound
them
when
they
face
it
for
the
first
time
as
for
the
northern
flora
the
question
whence
it
came
is
puzzling
enough
it
seems
difficult
to
conceive
how
any
plants
could
have
survived
when
scotland
was
an
archipelago
in
the
same
condition
as
greenland
is
now
and
we
have
no
proof
that
there
existed
after
the
glacial
epoch
any
northern
continent
from
which
the
plants
and
animals
could
have
come
back
to
us
the
species
of
plants
and
animals
common
to
britain
scandinavia
and
north
america
must
have
spread
in
times
when
a
continent
joining
them
did
exist
but
some
light
has
been
thrown
on
this
question
by
an
article
as
charming
as
it
is
able
on
the
physics
of
the
arctic
ice
by
brown
of
campster
you
will
find
it
in
the
quarterly
journal
of
the
geological
society
for
february
he
shows
there
that
even
in
greenland
peaks
and
crags
are
left
free
enough
from
ice
to
support
a
vegetation
of
between
three
hundred
or
four
hundred
species
of
flowering
plants
and
therefore
he
well
says
we
must
be
careful
to
avoid
concluding
that
the
plant
and
animal
life
on
the
dreary
shores
or
of
the
old
glacial
scotland
was
poor
the
same
would
hold
good
of
our
mountains
and
if
so
we
may
look
with
respect
even
awe
on
the
alpine
plants
of
wales
scotland
and
the
lake
mountains
as
organisms
stunted
it
may
be
and
even
degraded
by
their
long
battle
with
the
elements
but
venerable
from
their
age
historic
from
their
endurance
relics
of
an
older
temperate
world
they
have
lived
through
thousands
of
centuries
of
frost
and
fog
to
sun
themselves
in
a
temperate
climate
once
more
i
can
never
pick
one
of
them
without
a
tinge
of
shame
and
to
exterminate
one
of
them
is
to
destroy
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
collecting
the
last
of
a
family
which
god
has
taken
the
trouble
to
preserve
for
thousands
of
centuries
i
trust
that
these
hints
for
i
can
call
them
nothing
more
will
at
least
awaken
any
young
naturalist
who
has
hitherto
only
collected
natural
objects
to
study
the
really
important
and
interesting
question
how
did
these
things
get
here
now
hence
arise
questions
which
may
puzzle
the
mind
of
a
hampshire
naturalist
you
have
in
this
neighbourhood
as
you
well
know
two
or
rather
three
soils
each
carrying
its
peculiar
vegetation
first
you
have
the
clay
lying
on
the
chalk
and
carrying
vast
woodlands
seemingly
primeval
next
you
have
the
chalk
with
its
peculiar
delicate
and
often
fragrant
crop
of
plants
and
next
you
have
the
poor
sands
and
clays
of
the
new
forest
basin
saturated
with
iron
and
therefore
carrying
a
moorland
or
loving
vegetation
in
many
respects
quite
different
from
the
others
and
this
moorland
soil
and
this
vegetation
with
a
few
singular
exceptions
repeats
itself
as
i
daresay
you
know
in
the
north
of
the
county
in
the
bagshot
basin
as
it
is
called
the
moors
of
aldershot
hartford
bridge
and
windsor
forest
now
what
a
variety
of
interesting
questions
are
opened
up
by
these
simple
facts
how
did
these
three
floras
get
each
to
its
present
place
where
did
each
come
from
how
did
it
get
past
or
through
the
other
till
each
set
of
plants
after
long
internecine
competition
settled
itself
down
in
the
sheet
of
land
most
congenial
to
it
and
when
did
each
come
hither
which
is
the
oldest
will
any
one
tell
me
whether
the
healthy
floras
of
the
moors
or
the
thymy
flora
of
the
chalk
downs
were
the
earlier
inhabitants
of
these
isles
to
these
questions
i
can
not
get
any
answer
and
they
can
not
be
answered
without
first
a
very
careful
study
of
the
range
of
each
species
of
plant
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
next
without
careful
study
of
those
stupendous
changes
in
the
shape
of
this
island
which
have
taken
place
at
a
very
late
geological
epoch
the
composition
of
the
flora
of
our
moorlands
is
as
yet
to
me
an
utter
puzzle
we
have
lycopodiums
three
species
enormously
ancient
forms
which
have
survived
the
age
of
ice
but
did
they
crawl
downward
hither
from
the
northern
mountains
or
upward
hither
from
the
pyrenees
we
have
the
beautiful
bog
asphodel
again
an
enormously
ancient
form
for
it
is
strange
to
say
common
to
north
america
and
to
northern
europe
but
does
not
enter
asia
almost
an
unique
instance
it
must
surely
have
come
from
the
north
and
points
as
do
many
species
of
plants
and
animals
to
the
time
when
north
europe
and
north
america
were
joined
we
have
sparingly
in
north
hampshire
though
strangely
not
on
the
bagshot
moors
the
common
or
northern
butterwort
pinguicula
vulgaris
and
also
in
the
south
the
new
forest
part
of
the
county
the
delicate
little
pinguicula
lusitanica
the
only
species
now
found
in
devon
and
cornwall
marking
the
new
forest
as
the
extreme
eastern
limit
of
the
atlantic
flora
we
have
again
the
heaths
which
as
i
have
just
said
are
found
neither
in
america
nor
in
asia
and
must
i
believe
have
come
from
some
land
long
since
submerged
beneath
the
sea
but
more
we
have
in
the
new
forest
two
plants
which
are
members
of
the
south
europe
or
properly
the
atlantic
flora
which
must
have
come
from
the
south
and
and
which
are
found
in
no
other
spots
in
these
islands
i
mean
the
lovely
gladiolus
which
grows
abundantly
under
the
ferns
near
lyndhurst
certainly
wild
but
it
does
not
approach
england
elsewhere
nearer
than
the
loire
and
the
rhine
and
next
that
delicate
orchid
the
spiranthes
aestivalis
which
is
known
only
in
a
bog
near
lyndhurst
and
in
the
channel
islands
while
on
the
continent
it
extends
from
southern
europe
all
through
france
now
what
do
these
two
plants
mark
they
give
us
a
point
in
botany
though
not
in
time
to
determine
when
the
south
of
england
was
parted
from
the
opposite
shores
of
france
and
whenever
that
was
it
was
just
after
the
gladiolus
and
spiranthes
got
hither
two
little
colonies
of
these
lovely
flowers
arrived
just
before
their
retreat
was
cut
off
they
found
the
country
already
occupied
with
other
plants
and
not
being
reinforced
by
fresh
colonists
from
the
south
have
not
been
able
to
spread
farther
north
than
lyndhurst
thus
in
the
new
forest
and
i
may
say
in
the
bagshot
moors
you
find
plants
which
you
do
not
expect
and
do
not
find
plants
which
you
do
expect
and
you
are
or
ought
to
be
puzzled
and
i
hope
also
interested
and
stirred
up
to
find
out
more
i
spoke
just
now
of
the
time
when
england
was
joined
to
france
as
bearing
on
hampshire
botany
it
bears
no
less
on
hampshire
zoology
in
insects
for
instance
the
presence
of
the
purple
emperor
and
the
white
admiral
in
our
hampshire
woods
as
well
as
the
abundance
of
the
great
point
to
a
time
when
the
two
countries
were
joined
at
least
as
far
west
as
hampshire
while
the
absence
of
these
insects
farther
to
the
westward
shows
that
the
countries
if
ever
joined
were
already
parted
and
that
those
insects
have
not
yet
had
time
to
spread
westward
the
presence
of
these
two
butterflies
and
partly
of
the
along
the
coast
of
england
as
far
as
the
primeval
forests
of
south
lincolnshire
points
as
do
a
hundred
other
facts
to
a
time
when
the
straits
of
dover
either
did
not
exist
or
were
the
bed
of
a
river
running
from
the
west
and
when
as
i
told
you
just
now
all
the
rivers
which
now
run
into
the
german
ocean
from
the
humber
on
the
west
to
the
elbe
on
the
east
discharged
themselves
into
the
sea
between
scotland
and
norway
after
wandering
through
a
vast
lowland
covered
with
countless
herds
of
mammoth
rhinoceros
gigantic
ox
and
other
mammals
now
extinct
while
the
birds
as
far
as
we
know
the
insects
the
fish
and
even
as
my
friend
brady
has
proved
the
entomostraca
of
the
rivers
were
the
same
in
what
is
now
holland
as
in
what
is
now
our
eastern
counties
i
could
dwell
long
on
this
matter
i
could
talk
long
about
how
certain
species
of
lepidoptera
moths
and
butterflies
like
papilio
machaon
and
podalirius
swarm
through
france
reach
up
to
the
british
channel
and
have
not
crossed
it
with
the
exception
of
one
colony
of
machaon
in
the
cambridgeshire
fens
i
could
talk
long
about
a
similar
phenomenon
in
the
case
of
our
migratory
and
singing
birds
how
many
exquisite
species
notably
those
two
glorious
songsters
the
orphean
warbler
and
hippolais
which
delight
our
ears
everywhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
follow
our
nightingales
blackcaps
and
warblers
northward
every
spring
almost
to
the
straits
of
dover
but
dare
not
cross
simply
because
they
have
been
as
it
were
created
since
the
gulf
was
opened
and
have
never
learnt
from
their
parents
how
to
fly
over
it
in
the
case
of
fishes
again
i
might
say
much
on
the
curious
fact
that
the
cyprinidae
or
white
fish
carp
and
their
natural
enemy
the
pike
are
indigenous
i
believe
only
to
the
rivers
english
or
continental
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
straits
of
dover
while
the
rivers
on
the
western
side
were
originally
tenanted
like
our
hampshire
streams
as
now
almost
entirely
by
trout
their
only
cyprinoid
being
the
minnow
if
it
too
be
not
an
interloper
and
i
might
ask
you
to
consider
the
bearing
of
this
curious
fact
on
the
former
junction
of
england
and
france
but
i
have
only
time
to
point
out
to
you
a
few
curious
facts
with
regard
to
reptiles
which
should
be
specially
interesting
to
a
hampshire
you
know
of
course
that
in
ireland
there
are
no
reptiles
save
the
little
common
lizard
lacerta
agilis
and
a
few
frogs
on
the
how
they
got
there
i
can
not
conceive
and
you
will
of
course
guess
and
rightly
that
the
reason
of
the
absence
of
reptiles
is
that
ireland
was
parted
off
from
england
before
the
creatures
which
certainly
spread
from
southern
and
warmer
climates
had
time
to
get
there
you
know
of
course
that
we
have
a
few
reptiles
in
england
but
you
may
not
be
aware
that
as
soon
as
you
cross
the
channel
you
find
many
more
species
of
reptiles
than
here
as
well
as
those
which
you
find
here
the
magnificent
green
lizard
which
rattles
about
like
a
rabbit
in
a
french
forest
is
never
found
here
simply
because
it
had
not
worked
northward
till
after
the
channel
was
formed
but
there
are
three
reptiles
peculiar
to
this
part
of
england
which
should
be
most
interesting
to
a
hampshire
zoologist
the
one
is
the
sand
lizard
stirpium
found
on
and
i
suspect
in
the
south
hampshire
moors
likewise
a
north
european
and
french
species
another
the
coronella
laevis
a
harmless
french
and
austrian
snake
which
has
been
found
about
me
in
north
hants
and
south
berks
now
about
fifteen
or
twenty
times
i
have
had
three
specimens
from
my
own
parish
i
believe
it
not
to
be
uncommon
and
most
probably
to
be
found
by
those
who
will
look
both
in
the
new
forest
and
woolmer
the
third
is
the
natterjack
or
running
toad
bufo
rubeta
a
most
animal
with
a
yellow
stripe
down
his
back
which
is
common
with
us
at
eversley
and
common
also
in
many
moorlands
of
hants
and
surrey
and
according
to
fleming
on
heaths
near
london
and
as
far
as
lincolnshire
in
which
case
it
will
belong
to
the
germanic
fauna
now
here
again
we
have
cases
of
animals
which
have
just
been
able
to
get
hither
before
the
severance
of
england
and
france
and
which
not
being
reinforced
from
the
rear
have
been
forced
to
stop
in
small
and
probably
decreasing
colonies
on
the
spots
nearest
the
coast
which
were
fit
for
them
i
trust
that
i
have
not
kept
you
too
long
over
these
details
what
i
wish
to
impress
upon
you
is
that
hampshire
is
a
country
specially
fitted
for
the
study
of
important
questions
to
work
them
out
you
must
trace
the
geology
of
hampshire
and
indeed
of
east
dorset
you
must
try
to
form
a
conception
of
how
the
land
was
shaped
in
miocene
times
before
that
tremendous
upheaval
which
reared
the
chalk
cliffs
at
freshwater
upright
lifting
the
tertiary
beds
upon
their
northern
slopes
you
must
there
not
land
to
the
south
of
the
isle
of
wight
in
those
ages
and
for
ages
after
and
what
was
its
extent
and
shape
you
must
ask
when
was
the
gap
between
the
isle
of
wight
and
the
isle
of
purbeck
sawn
through
leaving
the
needles
as
remnants
on
one
side
and
old
harry
on
the
opposite
and
was
it
sawn
asunder
merely
by
the
gnawing
of
the
waves
you
must
ask
where
did
the
great
river
which
ran
from
the
west
where
poole
harbour
is
now
and
probably
through
what
is
now
the
solent
depositing
brackish
beds
right
and
left
where
i
say
did
it
run
into
the
sea
where
the
straits
of
dover
are
now
or
if
not
there
where
what
too
is
become
of
the
land
to
the
westward
composed
of
ancient
metamorphic
rocks
out
of
which
it
ran
and
deposited
on
what
are
now
the
haggerstone
moors
of
poole
vast
beds
of
grit
what
was
the
climate
on
its
banks
when
it
washed
down
the
delicate
leaves
of
trees
akin
to
our
modern
english
ones
which
are
found
in
the
fine
strata
of
bournemouth
when
finally
did
it
dwindle
down
to
the
brook
which
now
runs
through
wareham
town
was
its
bed
sea
or
dry
land
or
under
an
ice
sheet
during
the
long
ages
of
the
glacial
epoch
and
if
you
say
who
is
sufficient
for
these
things
who
can
answer
these
questions
i
answer
who
but
you
or
your
pupils
after
you
if
you
will
but
try
and
if
any
shall
reply
and
what
use
if
i
do
try
what
use
if
i
do
try
what
use
if
i
succeed
in
answering
every
question
which
you
have
propounded
shall
i
be
the
happier
for
it
shall
i
be
the
wiser
my
friends
whether
you
will
be
the
happier
for
it
or
for
any
knowledge
of
physical
science
or
for
any
other
knowledge
whatsoever
i
can
not
tell
that
lies
in
the
decision
of
a
higher
power
than
i
and
indeed
to
speak
honestly
i
do
not
think
that
or
any
other
branch
of
physical
science
is
likely
at
first
at
least
to
make
you
happy
neither
is
the
study
of
your
neither
is
religion
itself
we
were
not
sent
into
the
world
to
be
happy
but
to
be
right
at
least
poor
creatures
that
we
are
as
right
as
we
can
be
and
we
must
be
content
with
being
right
and
not
happy
for
i
fear
or
rather
i
hope
that
most
of
us
are
not
capable
of
carrying
out
talleyrand
recipe
for
perfect
happiness
on
earth
namely
a
hard
heart
and
a
good
digestion
therefore
as
our
hearts
are
happily
not
always
hard
and
our
digestions
unhappily
not
always
good
we
will
be
content
to
be
made
wise
by
physical
science
even
though
we
be
not
made
happy
and
we
shall
be
made
truly
wise
if
we
be
made
content
content
too
not
only
with
what
we
can
understand
but
content
with
what
we
do
not
understand
the
habit
of
mind
which
theologians
call
and
rightly
faith
in
god
the
true
and
solid
faith
which
comes
often
out
of
sadness
and
out
of
doubt
such
as
may
well
stir
in
us
at
first
sight
for
our
first
feeling
will
be
i
know
mine
was
when
i
began
to
look
into
these
matters
one
somewhat
of
dread
and
of
horror
here
were
all
these
creatures
animal
and
vegetable
competing
against
each
other
and
their
competition
was
so
earnest
and
complete
that
it
did
not
mean
as
it
does
among
honest
shopkeepers
in
a
civilised
country
i
will
make
a
little
more
money
than
you
but
i
will
crush
you
enslave
you
exterminate
you
eat
you
up
woe
to
the
weak
seems
to
be
nature
watchword
the
psalmist
says
the
righteous
shall
inherit
the
land
if
you
go
to
a
tropical
forest
or
indeed
if
you
observe
carefully
a
square
acre
of
any
english
land
cultivated
or
uncultivated
you
will
find
that
nature
text
at
first
sight
looks
a
very
different
one
she
seems
to
say
not
the
righteous
but
the
strong
shall
inherit
the
land
plant
insect
bird
what
not
find
a
weaker
plant
insect
bird
than
yourself
and
kill
it
and
take
possession
of
its
little
vineyard
and
no
naboth
curse
shall
follow
you
but
you
shall
inherit
and
thrive
therein
you
and
your
children
after
you
if
they
will
be
only
as
strong
and
as
cruel
as
you
are
that
is
nature
law
and
is
it
not
at
first
sight
a
fearful
law
internecine
competition
ruthless
selfishness
so
internecine
and
so
ruthless
that
as
i
have
wandered
in
tropic
forests
where
this
temper
is
shown
more
quickly
and
fiercely
though
not
in
the
least
more
evilly
than
in
our
slow
and
cold
temperate
one
i
have
said
really
these
trees
and
plants
are
as
wicked
as
so
many
human
beings
throughout
the
great
republic
of
the
organic
world
the
motto
of
the
majority
is
and
always
has
been
as
far
back
as
we
can
see
what
it
is
and
always
has
been
with
the
majority
of
human
beings
everyone
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
overreaching
tyranny
the
temper
which
fawns
and
clings
and
plays
the
parasite
as
long
as
it
is
down
and
when
it
has
risen
fattens
on
its
patron
blood
and
life
these
and
the
other
works
of
the
flesh
are
the
works
of
average
plants
and
animals
as
far
as
they
can
practise
them
at
least
so
says
at
first
sight
the
science
of
till
the
naturalist
if
he
be
also
human
and
humane
is
glad
to
escape
from
the
confusion
and
darkness
of
the
universal
of
selfishness
into
the
order
and
light
of
tide
for
then
there
comes
to
him
the
thought
and
are
these
all
the
facts
and
is
this
all
which
the
facts
mean
that
mutual
competition
is
one
law
of
nature
we
see
too
plainly
but
is
there
not
besides
that
law
a
law
of
mutual
help
true
it
is
as
the
wise
man
has
said
that
the
very
hyssop
on
the
wall
grows
there
because
all
the
forces
of
the
universe
could
not
prevent
its
growing
all
honour
to
the
hyssop
a
brave
plant
it
has
fought
a
brave
fight
and
has
its
just
deserts
as
everything
in
nature
has
and
so
has
won
but
did
all
the
powers
of
the
universe
combine
to
prevent
it
growing
is
not
that
a
statement
of
facts
did
not
all
the
powers
of
the
universe
also
combine
to
make
it
grow
if
only
it
had
valour
and
worth
wherewith
to
grow
did
not
the
rains
feed
it
the
very
mortar
in
the
wall
give
lime
to
its
roots
were
not
electricity
gravitation
and
i
know
not
what
of
chemical
and
mechanical
forces
busy
about
the
little
plant
and
every
cell
of
it
kindly
and
patiently
ready
to
help
it
if
it
would
only
help
itself
surely
this
is
true
true
of
every
organic
thing
animal
and
vegetable
and
mineral
too
for
aught
i
know
and
so
we
must
soften
our
sadness
at
the
sight
of
the
universal
mutual
war
by
the
sight
of
an
equally
universal
mutual
help
but
more
it
is
true
too
true
if
you
will
that
all
things
live
on
each
other
but
is
it
not
therefore
equally
true
that
all
things
live
for
each
other
that
and
not
selfishness
is
at
the
bottom
the
law
of
nature
as
it
is
the
law
of
grace
and
the
law
of
as
it
is
the
law
of
all
religion
and
virtue
worthy
of
the
name
is
it
not
true
that
everything
has
to
help
something
else
to
live
whether
it
knows
it
or
not
that
not
a
plant
or
an
animal
can
turn
again
to
its
dust
without
giving
food
and
existence
to
other
plants
other
animals
that
the
very
tiger
seemingly
the
most
useless
tyrant
of
all
tyrants
is
still
of
use
when
after
sending
out
of
the
world
suddenly
and
all
but
painlessly
many
an
animal
which
would
without
him
have
starved
in
misery
through
a
diseased
old
age
he
himself
dies
and
in
dying
gives
by
his
own
carcase
the
means
of
life
and
of
enjoyment
to
a
thousandfold
more
living
creatures
than
ever
his
paws
destroyed
and
so
the
longer
one
watches
the
great
struggle
for
existence
the
more
charitable
the
more
hopeful
one
becomes
as
one
sees
that
consciously
or
unconsciously
the
law
of
nature
is
after
all
sacrifice
unconscious
in
plants
and
animals
as
far
as
we
know
save
always
those
magnificent
instances
of
true
shown
by
the
social
insects
by
ants
bees
and
others
which
put
to
shame
by
a
civilisation
truly
noble
why
should
i
not
say
divine
for
god
ordained
it
the
selfishness
and
barbarism
of
man
but
be
that
as
it
may
in
man
the
law
of
whether
unconscious
or
not
in
the
animals
rises
into
consciousness
just
as
far
as
he
is
a
man
and
the
crowning
lesson
of
may
be
when
we
have
worked
it
out
after
all
the
lesson
of
of
the
infinite
of
god
for
man
and
nature
as
well
as
religion
may
say
to
us
ah
could
you
crush
that
ever
craving
lust
for
bliss
which
kills
all
bliss
and
lose
your
life
your
barren
unit
life
to
find
again
a
thousand
times
in
those
for
whom
you
die
so
were
you
men
and
women
and
should
hold
your
rightful
rank
in
god
great
universe
wherein
in
heaven
or
earth
by
will
or
nature
naught
lives
for
self
all
all
from
crown
to
base
the
lamb
before
the
world
foundation
slain
the
angels
ministers
to
god
elect
the
sun
who
only
shines
to
light
the
worlds
the
clouds
whose
glory
is
to
die
in
showers
the
fleeting
streams
who
in
their
ocean
graves
flee
the
decay
of
stagnant
the
oak
ennobled
by
the
shipwright
axe
the
soil
which
yields
its
marrow
to
the
flower
the
flower
which
feeds
a
thousand
velvet
worms
born
only
to
be
prey
to
every
bird
all
spend
themselves
on
others
and
shall
man
whose
twofold
being
is
the
mystic
knot
which
couples
earth
with
heaven
doubly
bound
as
being
both
worm
and
angel
to
that
service
by
which
both
worms
and
angels
hold
their
life
shall
he
whose
every
breath
is
debt
on
debt
refuse
forsooth
to
be
what
god
has
made
him
no
let
him
show
himself
the
creatures
lord
by
gift
of
that
which
they
perforce
by
nature
law
endure
my
friends
scientific
and
others
if
the
study
of
shall
help
to
teach
you
this
or
anything
like
this
i
think
that
though
it
may
not
make
you
more
happy
it
may
yet
make
you
more
wise
and
therefore
what
is
better
than
being
more
happy
namely
more
blessed
the
study
of
natural
history
for
soldiers
gentlemen
when
i
accepted
the
honour
of
lecturing
here
i
took
for
granted
that
so
select
an
audience
would
expect
from
me
not
mere
amusement
but
somewhat
of
instruction
or
if
that
be
too
ambitious
a
word
for
me
to
use
at
least
some
fresh
hint
if
i
were
able
to
give
one
as
to
how
they
should
fulfil
the
ideal
of
military
men
in
such
an
age
as
this
to
touch
on
military
matters
even
had
i
been
conversant
with
them
seemed
to
me
an
impertinence
i
am
bound
to
take
for
granted
that
every
man
knows
his
own
business
best
and
i
incline
more
and
more
to
the
opinion
that
military
men
should
be
left
to
work
out
the
problems
of
their
art
for
themselves
without
the
advice
or
criticism
of
civilians
but
i
hold
and
i
am
sure
that
you
will
agree
with
me
that
if
the
soldier
is
to
be
thus
trusted
by
the
nation
and
left
to
himself
to
do
his
own
work
his
own
way
he
must
be
educated
in
all
practical
matters
as
highly
as
the
average
of
educated
civilians
he
must
know
all
that
they
know
and
his
own
art
besides
just
as
a
clergyman
being
a
man
plus
a
priest
is
bound
to
be
a
man
and
a
good
man
over
and
above
his
priesthood
so
is
the
soldier
bound
to
be
a
civilian
and
a
civilian
plus
his
soldierly
qualities
and
acquirements
it
seemed
to
me
therefore
that
i
might
without
impertinence
ask
you
to
consider
a
branch
of
knowledge
which
is
becoming
yearly
more
and
more
important
in
the
eyes
of
civilians
of
which
therefore
the
soldier
ought
at
least
to
know
something
in
order
to
put
him
on
a
par
with
the
general
intelligence
of
the
nation
i
do
not
say
that
he
is
to
devote
much
time
to
it
or
to
follow
it
up
into
specialities
but
that
he
ought
to
be
well
grounded
in
its
principles
and
methods
that
he
ought
to
be
aware
of
its
importance
and
its
usefulness
that
so
if
he
comes
into
contact
as
he
will
more
and
more
with
scientific
men
he
may
understand
them
respect
them
befriend
them
and
be
befriended
by
them
in
turn
and
how
desirable
this
last
result
is
i
shall
tell
you
hereafter
there
are
those
i
doubt
not
among
my
audience
who
do
not
need
the
advice
which
i
shall
presume
to
give
who
belong
to
that
class
among
officers
of
whom
i
have
often
said
and
i
have
found
scientific
men
cordially
agree
with
me
that
they
are
the
most
modest
and
the
most
teachable
of
men
but
even
in
their
case
there
can
be
no
harm
in
going
over
deliberately
a
question
of
such
importance
in
putting
it
as
it
were
into
shape
and
insisting
on
arguments
which
may
perhaps
not
have
occurred
to
some
of
them
let
me
in
the
first
place
reassure
those
if
any
such
there
be
who
may
suppose
from
the
title
of
my
lecture
that
i
am
only
going
to
recommend
them
to
collect
weeds
and
butterflies
rats
and
mice
and
such
small
deer
far
from
it
the
honourable
title
of
natural
history
has
and
unwisely
been
restricted
too
much
of
late
years
to
the
mere
study
of
plants
and
animals
i
desire
to
restore
the
words
to
their
original
and
proper
meaning
the
history
of
nature
that
is
of
all
that
is
born
and
grows
in
time
in
short
of
all
natural
objects
if
any
one
shall
say
by
that
definition
you
make
not
only
geology
and
chemistry
branches
of
natural
history
but
meteorology
and
astronomy
likewise
i
can
not
deny
it
they
deal
each
of
them
with
realms
of
nature
geology
is
literally
the
natural
history
of
soils
and
lands
chemistry
the
natural
history
of
compounds
organic
and
inorganic
meteorology
the
natural
history
of
climates
astronomy
the
natural
history
of
planetary
and
solar
bodies
and
more
you
can
not
now
study
deeply
any
branch
of
what
is
popularly
called
natural
history
that
is
plants
and
animals
without
finding
it
necessary
to
learn
something
and
more
and
more
as
you
go
deeper
of
those
very
sciences
as
the
marvellous
interdependence
of
all
natural
objects
and
forces
unfolds
itself
more
and
more
so
the
once
separate
sciences
which
treated
of
different
classes
of
natural
objects
are
forced
to
interpenetrate
as
it
were
and
to
supplement
themselves
by
knowledge
borrowed
from
each
other
thus
to
give
a
single
instance
no
man
can
now
be
a
botanist
unless
he
be
also
no
mean
meteorologist
no
mean
geologist
and
as
darwin
has
shown
in
his
extraordinary
discoveries
about
the
fertilisation
of
plants
by
insects
no
mean
entomologist
likewise
it
is
difficult
therefore
and
indeed
somewhat
unwise
and
unfair
to
put
any
limit
to
the
term
natural
history
save
that
it
shall
deal
only
with
nature
and
with
matter
and
shall
not
pretend
as
some
would
have
it
to
do
just
now
to
go
out
of
its
own
sphere
to
meddle
with
moral
and
spiritual
matters
but
for
practical
purposes
we
may
define
the
natural
history
of
the
causes
which
have
made
it
what
it
is
and
filled
it
with
the
natural
objects
which
it
holds
and
if
any
one
would
know
how
to
study
the
natural
history
of
any
given
spot
as
the
history
of
the
causes
which
have
made
it
what
it
is
and
filled
it
with
the
natural
objects
which
it
holds
and
if
any
one
would
know
how
to
study
the
natural
history
of
a
place
and
how
to
write
it
let
him
read
and
if
he
has
read
its
delightful
pages
in
youth
read
once
again
that
hitherto
unrivalled
little
monograph
white
natural
history
of
selborne
and
let
him
then
try
by
the
light
of
improved
science
to
do
for
any
district
where
he
may
be
stationed
what
white
did
for
selborne
nearly
one
hundred
years
ago
let
him
study
its
plants
its
animals
its
soils
and
rocks
and
last
but
not
least
its
scenery
as
the
total
outcome
of
what
the
soils
and
plants
and
animals
have
made
it
i
say
have
made
it
how
far
the
nature
of
the
soils
and
the
rocks
will
affect
the
scenery
of
a
district
may
be
well
learnt
from
a
very
clever
and
interesting
little
book
of
professor
geikie
on
the
scenery
of
scotland
as
affected
by
its
geological
structure
how
far
the
plants
and
trees
affect
not
merely
the
general
beauty
the
richness
or
barrenness
of
a
country
but
also
its
very
shape
the
rate
at
which
the
hills
are
destroyed
and
washed
into
the
lowland
the
rate
at
which
the
seaboard
is
being
removed
by
the
action
of
waves
all
these
are
branches
of
study
which
is
becoming
more
and
more
important
and
even
in
the
study
of
animals
and
their
effects
on
the
vegetation
questions
of
really
deep
interest
will
arise
you
will
find
that
certain
plants
and
trees
can
not
thrive
in
a
district
while
others
can
because
the
former
are
browsed
down
by
cattle
or
their
seeds
eaten
by
birds
and
the
latter
are
not
that
certain
seeds
are
carried
in
the
coats
of
animals
or
wafted
abroad
by
winds
others
are
not
certain
trees
destroyed
wholesale
by
insects
while
others
are
not
that
in
a
hundred
ways
the
animal
and
vegetable
life
of
a
district
act
and
react
upon
each
other
and
that
the
climate
the
average
temperature
the
maximum
and
minimum
temperatures
the
rainfall
act
on
them
and
in
the
case
of
the
vegetation
are
reacted
on
again
by
them
the
diminution
of
rainfall
by
the
destruction
of
forests
its
increase
by
replanting
them
and
the
effect
of
both
on
the
healthiness
or
unhealthiness
of
a
place
as
in
the
case
of
the
mauritius
where
a
once
healthy
island
has
become
pestilential
seemingly
from
the
clearing
away
of
the
vegetation
on
the
banks
of
streams
all
this
though
to
study
it
deeply
requires
a
fair
knowledge
of
meteorology
and
even
of
a
science
or
two
more
is
surely
well
worth
the
attention
of
any
educated
man
who
is
put
in
charge
of
the
health
and
lives
of
human
beings
you
will
surely
agree
with
me
that
the
habit
of
mind
required
for
such
a
study
as
this
is
the
very
same
as
is
required
for
successful
military
study
in
fact
i
should
say
that
the
same
intellect
which
would
develop
into
a
great
military
man
would
develop
also
into
a
great
naturalist
i
say
intellect
the
military
man
would
require
what
the
naturalist
would
not
over
and
above
his
intellect
a
special
force
of
will
in
order
to
translate
his
theories
into
fact
and
make
his
campaigns
in
the
field
and
not
merely
on
paper
but
i
am
speaking
only
of
the
habit
of
mind
required
for
study
of
that
inductive
habit
of
mind
which
works
steadily
and
by
rule
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
that
habit
of
mind
of
which
it
has
been
said
the
habit
of
seeing
the
habit
of
knowing
what
we
see
the
habit
of
discerning
differences
and
likenesses
the
habit
of
classifying
accordingly
the
habit
of
searching
for
hypotheses
which
shall
connect
and
explain
those
classified
facts
the
habit
of
verifying
these
hypotheses
by
applying
them
to
fresh
facts
the
habit
of
throwing
them
away
bravely
if
they
will
not
fit
the
habit
of
general
patience
diligence
accuracy
reverence
for
facts
for
their
own
sake
and
love
of
truth
for
its
own
sake
in
one
word
the
habit
of
reverent
and
implicit
obedience
to
the
laws
of
nature
whatever
they
may
be
these
are
not
merely
intellectual
but
also
moral
habits
which
will
stand
men
in
practical
good
stead
in
every
affair
of
life
and
in
every
question
even
the
most
awful
which
may
come
before
them
as
rational
and
social
beings
and
specially
valuable
are
they
surely
to
the
military
man
the
very
essence
of
whose
study
to
be
successful
lies
first
in
continuous
and
accurate
observation
and
then
in
calm
and
judicious
arrangement
therefore
it
is
that
i
hold
and
hold
strongly
that
the
study
of
physical
science
far
from
interfering
with
an
officer
studies
much
less
unfitting
for
them
must
assist
him
in
them
by
keeping
his
mind
always
in
the
very
attitude
and
the
very
temper
which
they
require
if
any
smile
at
this
theory
of
mine
let
them
recollect
one
curious
fact
that
perhaps
the
greatest
captain
of
the
old
world
was
trained
by
perhaps
the
greatest
philosopher
of
the
old
world
the
father
of
natural
history
that
aristotle
was
the
tutor
of
alexander
of
macedon
i
do
not
fancy
of
course
that
aristotle
taught
alexander
any
natural
history
but
this
we
know
that
he
taught
him
to
use
those
very
faculties
by
which
aristotle
became
a
natural
historian
and
many
things
besides
that
he
called
out
in
his
pupil
somewhat
of
his
own
extraordinary
powers
of
observation
extraordinary
powers
of
arrangement
he
helped
to
make
him
a
great
general
but
he
helped
to
make
him
more
a
great
politician
coloniser
discoverer
he
instilled
into
him
such
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
natural
history
that
alexander
helped
him
nobly
in
his
researches
and
if
athenaeus
is
to
be
believed
gave
him
eight
hundred
talents
towards
perfecting
his
history
of
animals
surely
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
this
close
friendship
between
the
natural
philosopher
and
the
soldier
has
changed
the
whole
course
of
civilisation
to
this
very
day
do
not
consider
me
utopian
when
i
tell
you
that
i
should
like
to
see
the
study
of
physical
science
an
integral
part
of
the
curriculum
of
every
military
school
i
would
train
the
mind
of
the
lad
who
was
to
become
hereafter
an
officer
in
the
army
and
in
the
navy
likewise
by
accustoming
him
to
careful
observation
of
and
sound
thought
about
the
face
of
nature
of
the
commonest
objects
under
his
feet
just
as
much
as
the
stars
above
his
head
provided
always
that
he
learnt
not
at
from
books
but
where
alone
ho
can
really
learn
either
war
or
nature
in
the
field
by
actual
observation
actual
experiment
a
laboratory
for
chemical
experiment
is
a
good
thing
it
is
true
as
far
as
it
goes
but
i
should
prefer
to
the
laboratory
a
naturalists
club
such
as
are
prospering
now
at
several
of
the
best
public
schools
certain
that
the
boys
would
get
more
of
sound
inductive
habits
of
mind
as
well
as
more
health
manliness
and
cheerfulness
amid
scenes
to
remember
which
will
be
a
joy
for
ever
than
they
ever
can
by
bending
over
retorts
and
crucibles
amid
smells
even
to
remember
which
is
a
pain
for
ever
but
i
would
whether
a
existed
or
not
require
of
every
young
man
entering
the
army
or
navy
indeed
of
every
young
man
entering
any
liberal
profession
whatsoever
a
fair
knowledge
such
as
would
enable
him
to
pass
an
examination
in
what
the
germans
call
in
that
knowledge
of
the
face
of
the
earth
and
of
its
products
for
which
we
english
have
as
yet
cared
so
little
that
we
have
actually
no
english
name
for
it
save
the
clumsy
and
questionable
one
of
physical
geography
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
hardly
any
readable
school
books
about
it
save
keith
physical
atlas
an
acquaintance
with
which
last
i
should
certainly
require
of
young
men
it
does
seem
most
strange
or
rather
will
seem
most
strange
a
hundred
years
hence
that
we
the
nation
of
colonists
the
nation
of
sailors
the
nation
of
foreign
commerce
the
nation
of
foreign
military
stations
the
nation
of
travellers
for
travelling
sake
the
nation
of
which
one
man
here
and
another
there
as
schleiden
sets
forth
in
his
book
the
plant
in
a
charming
ideal
conversation
at
the
travellers
club
has
seen
and
enjoyed
more
of
the
wonders
and
beauties
of
this
planet
than
the
men
of
any
nation
not
even
excepting
the
germans
that
this
nation
i
say
should
as
yet
have
done
nothing
or
all
but
nothing
to
teach
in
her
schools
a
knowledge
of
that
planet
of
which
she
needs
to
know
more
and
can
if
she
will
know
more
than
any
other
nation
upon
it
as
for
the
practical
utility
of
such
studies
to
a
soldier
i
only
need
i
trust
to
hint
at
it
to
such
an
assembly
as
this
all
must
see
of
what
advantage
a
rough
knowledge
of
the
botany
of
a
district
would
be
to
an
officer
leading
an
exploring
party
or
engaged
in
bush
warfare
to
know
what
plants
are
poisonous
what
plants
too
are
eatable
and
many
more
are
eatable
than
is
usually
supposed
what
plants
yield
oleaginous
substances
whether
for
food
or
for
other
uses
what
plants
yield
vegetable
acids
as
preventives
of
scurvy
what
timbers
are
available
for
each
of
many
different
purposes
what
will
resist
wet
and
the
attacks
of
insects
what
again
can
be
used
at
a
pinch
for
medicine
or
for
styptics
and
be
sure
as
a
wise
west
indian
doctor
once
said
to
me
that
there
is
more
good
medicine
wild
in
the
bush
than
there
is
in
all
the
druggists
shops
surely
all
this
is
a
knowledge
not
beneath
the
notice
of
any
enterprising
officer
above
all
of
an
officer
of
engineers
i
only
ask
any
one
who
thinks
that
i
may
be
in
the
right
to
glance
through
the
lists
of
useful
vegetable
products
given
in
lindley
vegetable
kingdom
a
miracle
of
learning
and
see
the
vast
field
open
still
to
a
thoughtful
and
observant
man
even
while
on
service
and
not
to
forget
that
such
knowledge
if
he
should
hereafter
leave
the
service
and
settle
as
many
do
in
a
distant
land
may
be
a
solid
help
to
his
future
prosperity
so
strongly
do
i
feel
on
this
matter
that
i
should
like
to
see
some
knowledge
at
least
of
oliver
excellent
little
first
book
of
indian
botany
required
of
all
officers
going
to
our
indian
empire
but
as
that
will
not
be
at
least
for
many
a
year
to
come
i
recommend
any
gentlemen
going
to
india
to
get
that
book
and
while
away
the
hours
of
the
outward
voyage
by
acquiring
knowledge
which
will
be
a
continual
source
of
interest
and
it
may
be
now
and
then
of
profit
to
them
during
their
stay
abroad
and
for
geology
again
as
i
do
not
expect
you
all
or
perhaps
any
of
you
to
become
such
botanists
as
general
monro
whose
recent
monograph
of
the
bamboos
is
an
honour
to
british
botanists
and
a
proof
of
the
scientific
power
which
is
to
be
found
here
and
there
among
british
officers
so
i
do
not
expect
you
to
become
such
geologists
as
sir
roderick
murchison
or
even
to
add
such
a
grand
chapter
to
the
history
of
extinct
animals
as
major
cautley
did
by
his
discoveries
in
the
sewalik
hills
nevertheless
you
can
learn
and
i
should
earnestly
advise
you
to
learn
geology
and
mineralogy
enough
to
be
of
great
use
to
you
in
your
profession
and
of
use
too
should
you
relinquish
your
profession
hereafter
it
must
be
profitable
for
any
man
and
specially
for
you
to
know
how
and
where
to
find
good
limestone
building
stone
road
metal
it
must
be
good
to
be
able
to
distinguish
ores
and
mineral
products
it
must
be
good
to
know
as
a
geologist
will
usually
know
even
in
a
country
which
he
sees
for
the
first
time
where
water
is
likely
to
be
found
and
at
what
probable
depth
it
must
be
good
to
know
whether
the
water
is
fit
for
drinking
or
not
whether
it
is
unwholesome
or
merely
muddy
it
must
be
good
to
know
what
spots
are
likely
to
be
healthy
and
what
unhealthy
for
encamping
the
two
last
questions
depend
doubtless
on
meteorological
as
well
as
geological
accidents
but
the
answers
to
them
will
be
most
surely
found
out
by
the
scientific
man
because
the
facts
connected
with
them
are
like
all
other
facts
determined
by
natural
laws
after
what
one
has
heard
in
past
years
of
barracks
built
in
spots
plainly
pestilential
of
soldiers
encamped
in
ruined
cities
reeking
with
the
dirt
and
poison
of
centuries
of
but
it
is
not
my
place
to
find
fault
all
i
will
say
is
that
the
wise
and
humane
officer
when
once
his
eyes
are
opened
to
the
practical
value
of
physical
science
will
surely
try
to
acquaint
himself
somewhat
with
those
laws
of
drainage
and
of
climate
geological
meteorological
chemical
which
influence
often
with
terrible
suddenness
and
fury
the
health
of
whole
armies
he
will
not
find
it
beyond
his
province
to
ascertain
the
amount
and
period
of
rainfalls
the
maxima
of
heat
and
of
cold
which
his
troops
may
have
to
endure
and
many
another
point
on
which
their
health
and
efficiency
nay
their
very
life
may
depend
but
which
are
now
too
exclusively
delegated
to
the
doctor
to
whose
province
they
do
not
really
belong
for
cure
i
take
the
liberty
of
believing
is
the
duty
of
the
medical
officer
prevention
that
of
the
military
thus
much
i
can
say
just
now
and
there
is
much
more
to
be
said
on
the
practical
uses
of
the
study
of
natural
history
but
let
me
remind
you
on
the
other
side
if
natural
history
will
help
you
you
in
return
can
help
her
and
would
i
doubt
not
help
her
and
help
scientific
men
at
home
if
once
you
looked
fairly
and
steadily
at
the
immense
importance
of
natural
history
of
the
knowledge
of
the
face
of
the
earth
i
believe
that
all
will
one
day
feel
more
or
less
that
to
know
the
earth
on
which
we
live
and
the
laws
of
it
by
which
we
live
is
a
sacred
duty
to
ourselves
to
our
children
after
us
and
to
all
whom
we
may
have
to
command
and
to
influence
ay
and
a
duty
to
god
likewise
for
is
it
not
a
duty
of
common
reverence
and
faith
towards
him
if
he
has
put
us
into
a
beautiful
and
wonderful
place
and
given
us
faculties
by
which
we
can
see
and
enjoy
and
use
that
place
is
it
not
a
duty
of
reverence
and
faith
towards
him
to
use
these
faculties
and
to
learn
the
lessons
which
he
has
laid
open
for
us
if
you
feel
that
as
i
think
you
all
will
some
day
feel
then
you
will
surely
feel
likewise
that
it
will
be
a
good
deed
i
do
not
say
a
necessary
duty
but
still
a
good
deed
and
praiseworthy
to
help
physical
science
forward
and
to
add
your
contributions
however
small
to
our
general
knowledge
of
the
earth
and
how
much
may
be
done
for
science
by
british
officers
especially
on
foreign
stations
i
need
not
point
out
i
know
that
much
has
been
done
chivalrously
and
well
by
officers
and
that
men
of
science
owe
them
and
give
them
hearty
thanks
for
their
labours
but
i
should
like
i
confess
to
see
more
done
still
i
should
like
to
see
every
foreign
station
what
one
or
two
officers
might
easily
make
it
an
advanced
post
of
physical
science
in
regular
communication
with
our
scientific
societies
at
home
sending
to
them
accurate
and
methodic
details
of
the
natural
history
of
each
district
details
hundredths
of
which
might
seem
worthless
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
but
which
would
all
be
precious
in
the
eyes
of
scientific
men
who
know
that
no
fact
is
really
unimportant
and
more
that
while
plodding
patiently
through
seemingly
unimportant
facts
you
may
stumble
on
one
of
infinite
importance
both
scientific
and
practical
for
the
student
of
nature
gentlemen
if
he
will
be
but
patient
diligent
methodical
is
liable
at
any
moment
to
the
same
good
fortune
as
befell
saul
of
old
when
he
went
out
to
seek
his
father
asses
and
found
a
kingdom
there
are
those
lastly
who
have
neither
time
nor
taste
for
the
technicalities
and
nice
distinctions
of
formal
natural
history
who
enjoy
nature
but
as
artists
or
as
sportsmen
and
not
as
men
of
science
let
them
follow
their
bent
freely
but
let
them
not
suppose
that
in
following
it
they
can
do
nothing
towards
enlarging
our
knowledge
of
nature
especially
when
on
foreign
stations
so
far
from
it
drawings
ought
always
to
be
valuable
whether
of
plants
animals
or
scenery
provided
only
they
are
accurate
and
the
more
spirited
and
full
of
genius
they
are
the
more
accurate
they
are
certain
to
be
for
nature
being
alive
a
lifeless
copy
of
her
is
necessarily
an
untrue
copy
most
thankful
to
any
officer
for
a
mere
sight
of
sketches
will
be
the
closest
botanist
who
to
his
own
sorrow
knows
of
his
plants
only
from
dried
specimens
or
the
closest
zoologist
who
knows
his
animals
from
skins
and
bones
and
if
any
one
answers
but
i
can
not
draw
i
rejoin
you
can
at
least
photograph
if
a
young
officer
going
out
to
foreign
parts
and
knowing
nothing
at
all
about
physical
science
did
me
the
honour
to
ask
me
what
he
could
do
for
science
i
should
tell
him
learn
to
photograph
take
photographs
of
every
strange
bit
of
which
strikes
your
fancy
and
of
every
extended
view
which
may
give
a
notion
of
the
general
lie
of
the
country
append
if
you
can
a
note
or
two
saying
whether
a
plain
is
rich
or
barren
whether
the
rock
is
sandstone
limestone
granitic
metamorphic
or
volcanic
lava
and
if
there
be
more
rocks
than
one
which
of
them
lies
on
the
other
and
send
them
to
be
exhibited
at
a
meeting
of
the
geological
society
i
doubt
not
that
the
learned
gentlemen
there
will
find
in
your
photographs
a
valuable
hint
or
two
for
which
they
will
be
much
obliged
i
learnt
for
instance
what
seemed
to
me
most
valuable
geological
lessons
from
mere
glances
at
drawings
i
believe
from
photographs
of
the
abyssinian
ranges
about
magdala
or
again
let
a
man
if
he
knows
nothing
of
botany
not
trouble
himself
with
collecting
and
drying
specimens
let
him
simply
photograph
every
strange
and
new
tree
or
plant
he
sees
to
give
a
general
notion
of
its
species
its
look
let
him
append
where
he
can
a
photograph
of
its
leafage
flower
fruit
and
send
them
to
hooker
or
any
distinguished
botanist
and
he
will
find
that
though
he
may
know
nothing
of
botany
he
will
have
pretty
certainly
increased
the
knowledge
of
those
who
do
know
the
sportsman
again
i
mean
the
sportsman
of
that
type
which
seems
peculiar
to
these
islands
who
loves
toil
and
danger
for
their
own
sakes
he
surely
is
a
naturalist
ipso
facto
though
he
knows
it
not
he
has
those
very
habits
of
keen
observation
on
which
all
sound
knowledge
of
nature
is
based
and
he
if
he
will
as
he
may
do
without
interfering
with
his
sport
can
study
the
habits
of
the
animals
among
whom
he
spends
wholesome
and
exciting
days
you
have
only
to
look
over
such
good
old
books
as
williams
wild
sports
of
the
east
campbell
old
forest
ranger
lloyd
scandinavian
adventures
and
last
but
not
least
waterton
wanderings
to
see
what
valuable
additions
to
true
zoology
the
knowledge
of
live
creatures
not
merely
dead
ones
british
sportsmen
have
made
and
still
can
make
and
as
for
the
employment
of
time
which
often
hangs
so
heavily
on
a
soldier
hands
really
i
am
ready
to
say
if
you
are
neither
men
of
science
nor
draughtsmen
nor
sportsmen
why
go
and
collect
beetles
it
is
not
very
dignified
i
know
nor
exciting
but
it
will
be
something
to
do
it
can
not
harm
you
if
you
take
as
do
an
indiarubber
sheet
to
lie
on
and
it
will
certainly
benefit
science
moreover
there
will
be
a
noble
humility
in
the
act
you
will
confess
to
the
public
that
you
consider
yourself
only
fit
to
catch
beetles
by
which
very
confession
you
will
prove
yourself
fit
for
much
finer
things
than
catching
beetles
and
meanwhile
as
i
said
before
you
will
be
at
least
out
of
harm
way
at
a
foreign
barrack
once
the
happiest
officer
i
met
because
the
most
regularly
employed
was
one
who
spent
his
time
in
collecting
butterflies
he
knew
nothing
about
them
scientifically
not
even
their
names
he
took
them
simply
for
their
wonderful
beauty
and
variety
and
in
the
hope
too
in
which
he
was
really
scientific
that
if
he
carefully
kept
every
form
which
he
saw
his
collection
might
be
of
use
some
day
to
entomologists
at
home
a
most
pleasant
gentleman
he
was
and
i
doubt
not
none
the
worse
soldier
for
his
butterfly
catching
commendable
also
in
my
eyes
was
another
officer
whom
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
who
on
a
remote
foreign
station
used
wisely
to
escape
from
the
temptations
of
the
world
into
an
entirely
original
and
most
pleasant
hermitage
for
finding
so
the
story
went
that
many
of
the
finest
insects
kept
to
the
and
never
came
to
ground
at
all
he
used
to
settle
himself
among
the
boughs
of
some
tree
in
the
tropic
forests
with
a
net
and
plenty
of
cigars
and
pass
his
hours
in
that
airy
making
dashes
every
now
and
then
at
some
splendid
monster
as
it
fluttered
round
his
head
his
example
need
not
be
followed
by
every
one
but
it
must
be
allowed
that
at
least
as
long
as
he
was
in
his
tree
he
was
neither
dawdling
grumbling
spending
money
nor
otherwise
harming
himself
and
perhaps
his
from
sheer
want
of
employment
one
word
more
and
i
have
done
if
i
was
allowed
to
give
one
special
piece
of
advice
to
a
young
officer
whether
of
the
army
or
navy
i
would
say
respect
scientific
men
associate
with
them
learn
from
them
find
them
to
be
as
you
will
usually
the
most
pleasant
and
instructive
of
companions
but
always
respect
them
allow
them
chivalrously
you
who
have
an
acknowledged
rank
their
yet
unacknowledged
rank
and
treat
them
as
all
the
world
will
treat
them
in
a
higher
and
truer
state
of
civilisation
they
do
not
yet
wear
the
queen
uniform
they
are
not
yet
accepted
servants
of
the
state
as
they
will
be
in
some
more
perfectly
organised
and
civilised
land
but
they
are
soldiers
nevertheless
and
good
soldiers
and
chivalrous
fighting
their
nation
battle
often
on
even
less
pay
than
you
and
with
still
less
chance
of
promotion
and
of
fame
against
most
real
and
fatal
enemies
against
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
this
planet
and
all
the
miseries
which
that
ignorance
begets
honour
them
for
their
work
sympathise
in
it
give
them
a
helping
hand
in
it
whenever
you
have
an
opportunity
and
what
opportunities
you
have
i
have
been
trying
to
sketch
for
you
night
and
more
work
at
it
yourselves
whenever
and
wherever
you
can
show
them
that
the
spirit
which
animates
them
the
hatred
of
ignorance
and
disorder
and
of
their
bestial
consequences
animates
you
likewise
show
them
that
the
habit
of
mind
which
they
value
in
themselves
the
habit
of
accurate
observation
and
careful
judgment
is
your
habit
likewise
show
them
that
you
value
science
not
merely
because
it
gives
better
weapons
of
destruction
and
of
defence
but
because
it
helps
you
to
become
able
to
take
a
just
and
accurate
view
of
any
subject
which
comes
before
you
and
to
cast
away
every
old
prejudice
and
every
hasty
judgment
in
the
face
of
truth
and
of
duty
and
it
will
be
better
for
you
and
for
them
but
why
what
need
for
the
soldier
and
the
man
of
science
to
fraternise
just
now
this
need
the
two
classes
which
will
have
an
increasing
it
may
be
a
preponderating
influence
on
the
fate
of
the
human
race
for
some
time
will
be
the
pupils
of
aristotle
and
those
of
alexander
the
men
of
science
and
the
soldiers
in
spite
of
all
appearances
and
all
declamations
to
the
contrary
that
is
my
firm
conviction
they
and
they
alone
will
be
left
to
rule
because
they
alone
each
in
his
own
sphere
have
learnt
to
obey
it
is
therefore
most
needful
for
the
welfare
of
society
that
they
should
pull
with
and
not
against
each
other
that
they
should
understand
each
other
respect
each
other
take
counsel
with
each
other
supplement
each
other
defects
bring
out
each
other
higher
tendencies
counteract
each
other
lower
ones
the
scientific
man
has
something
to
learn
of
you
gentlemen
which
i
doubt
not
that
he
will
learn
in
good
time
you
again
have
as
i
have
been
hinting
to
you
something
to
learn
of
him
which
you
i
doubt
not
will
learn
in
good
time
likewise
repeat
each
of
you
according
to
his
powers
the
old
friendship
between
aristotle
and
alexander
and
so
from
your
mutual
sympathy
and
a
class
of
thinkers
and
actors
may
yet
arise
which
can
save
this
nation
and
the
other
civilised
nations
of
the
world
from
that
of
which
i
had
rather
not
speak
and
wish
that
i
did
not
think
too
often
and
too
earnestly
i
may
be
a
dreamer
and
i
may
consider
in
my
turn
as
wilder
dreamers
than
myself
certain
persons
who
fancy
that
their
only
business
in
life
is
to
make
money
the
scientific
man
only
business
is
to
show
them
how
to
make
money
and
the
soldier
only
business
to
guard
their
money
for
them
be
that
as
it
may
the
finest
type
of
civilised
man
which
we
are
likely
to
see
for
some
generations
to
come
will
be
produced
by
a
combination
of
the
truly
military
with
the
truly
scientific
man
i
say
i
may
be
a
dreamer
but
you
at
least
as
well
as
my
scientific
friends
will
bear
with
me
for
my
dream
is
to
your
honour
superstition
having
accepted
the
very
great
honour
of
being
allowed
to
deliver
here
two
lectures
i
have
chosen
as
my
subject
superstition
and
science
it
is
with
superstition
that
this
first
lecture
will
deal
the
subject
seems
to
me
especially
fit
for
a
clergyman
for
he
should
more
than
other
men
be
able
to
avoid
trenching
on
two
subjects
rightly
excluded
from
this
institution
namely
theology
that
is
the
knowledge
of
god
and
religion
that
is
the
knowledge
of
duty
if
he
knows
as
he
should
what
is
theology
and
what
is
religion
then
he
should
best
know
what
is
not
theology
and
what
is
not
religion
for
my
own
part
i
entreat
you
at
the
outset
to
keep
in
mind
that
these
lectures
treat
of
matters
entirely
physical
which
have
in
reality
and
ought
to
have
in
our
minds
no
more
to
do
with
theology
and
religion
than
the
proposition
that
theft
is
wrong
has
to
do
with
the
proposition
that
the
three
angles
of
a
triangle
are
equal
to
two
right
angles
it
is
necessary
to
premise
this
because
many
are
of
opinion
that
superstition
is
a
corruption
of
religion
and
though
they
would
agree
that
as
such
corruptio
optimi
pessima
yet
they
would
look
on
religion
as
the
state
of
spiritual
health
and
superstition
as
one
of
spiritual
disease
others
again
holding
the
same
notion
but
not
considering
that
corruptio
optimi
pessima
have
been
in
all
ages
somewhat
inclined
to
be
merciful
to
superstition
as
a
child
of
reverence
as
a
mere
accidental
misdirection
of
one
of
the
noblest
and
most
wholesome
faculties
of
man
this
is
not
the
place
wherein
to
argue
with
either
of
these
parties
and
i
shall
simply
say
that
superstition
seems
to
me
altogether
a
physical
affection
as
thoroughly
material
and
corporeal
as
those
of
eating
or
sleeping
remembering
or
dreaming
after
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
define
superstition
in
order
to
have
some
tolerably
clear
understanding
of
what
we
are
talking
about
i
beg
leave
to
define
it
as
fear
of
the
unknown
johnson
who
was
no
dialectician
and
moreover
superstitious
enough
himself
gives
eight
different
definitions
of
the
word
which
is
equivalent
to
confessing
his
inability
to
define
it
at
all
unnecessary
fear
or
scruples
in
religion
observance
of
unnecessary
and
uncommanded
rites
or
practices
religion
without
morality
false
religion
reverence
of
beings
not
proper
objects
of
reverence
false
over
nicety
exactness
too
scrupulous
eight
meanings
which
on
the
principle
that
eight
eighths
or
indeed
eight
hundred
do
not
make
one
whole
may
be
considered
as
no
definition
his
first
thought
as
often
happens
is
the
best
unnecessary
fear
but
after
that
he
wanders
the
of
the
word
is
still
to
seek
but
indeed
the
popular
meaning
thanks
to
popular
common
sense
will
generally
be
found
to
contain
in
itself
the
let
us
go
back
to
the
latin
word
superstitio
cicero
says
that
the
superstitious
element
consists
in
a
certain
empty
dread
of
the
gods
a
purely
physical
affection
if
you
will
remember
three
things
that
dread
is
in
itself
a
physical
affection
that
the
gods
who
were
dreaded
were
with
the
vulgar
who
alone
dreaded
them
merely
impersonations
of
the
powers
of
nature
that
it
was
physical
injury
which
these
gods
were
expected
to
inflict
but
he
himself
agrees
with
this
theory
of
mine
for
he
says
shortly
after
that
not
only
philosophers
but
even
the
ancient
romans
had
separated
superstition
from
religion
and
that
the
word
was
first
applied
to
those
who
prayed
all
day
ut
liberi
sui
sibi
superstites
essent
might
survive
them
on
the
etymology
no
one
will
depend
who
knows
the
remarkable
absence
of
any
etymological
instinct
in
the
ancients
in
consequence
of
their
weak
grasp
of
that
sound
inductive
method
which
has
created
modern
criticism
but
if
it
be
correct
it
is
a
natural
and
pathetic
form
for
superstition
to
take
in
the
minds
of
men
who
saw
their
children
fade
and
die
probably
the
greater
number
of
them
beneath
diseases
which
mankind
could
neither
comprehend
nor
cure
the
best
exemplification
of
what
the
ancients
meant
by
superstition
is
to
be
found
in
the
lively
and
dramatic
words
of
aristotle
great
pupil
theophrastus
the
superstitious
man
according
to
him
after
having
washed
his
hands
with
lustral
water
that
is
water
in
which
a
torch
from
the
altar
had
been
quenched
goes
about
with
a
in
his
mouth
to
keep
off
evil
influences
as
the
pigs
in
devonshire
used
in
my
youth
to
go
about
with
a
withe
of
mountain
ash
round
their
necks
to
keep
off
the
evil
eye
if
a
weasel
crosses
his
path
he
stops
and
either
throws
three
pebbles
into
the
road
or
with
the
innate
selfishness
of
fear
lets
someone
else
go
before
him
and
attract
to
himself
the
harm
which
may
ensue
he
has
a
similar
dread
of
a
whom
he
compliments
in
the
name
of
its
mistress
pallas
athene
if
he
finds
a
serpent
in
his
house
he
sets
up
an
altar
to
it
if
he
pass
at
a
an
anointed
stone
he
pours
oil
on
it
kneels
down
and
adores
it
if
a
rat
has
nibbled
one
of
his
sacks
he
takes
it
for
a
fearful
portent
a
superstition
which
cicero
also
mentions
he
dare
not
sit
on
a
tomb
because
it
would
be
assisting
at
his
own
funeral
he
purifies
endlessly
his
house
saying
that
hecate
that
is
the
moon
has
exercised
some
malign
influence
on
it
and
many
other
purifications
he
observes
of
which
i
shall
only
say
that
they
are
by
their
nature
plainly
like
the
last
meant
as
preservatives
against
unseen
malarias
or
contagions
possible
or
impossible
he
assists
every
month
with
his
children
at
the
mysteries
of
the
orphic
priests
and
finally
whenever
he
sees
an
epileptic
patient
he
spits
in
his
own
bosom
to
avert
the
evil
omen
i
have
quoted
i
believe
every
fact
given
by
theophrastus
and
you
will
agree
i
am
sure
that
the
moving
and
inspiring
element
of
such
a
character
is
mere
bodily
fear
of
unknown
evil
the
only
superstition
attributed
to
him
which
does
not
at
first
sight
seem
to
have
its
root
in
dread
is
that
of
the
orphic
mysteries
but
of
them
muller
says
that
the
dionusos
whom
they
worshipped
was
an
infernal
deity
connected
with
hades
and
was
the
personification
not
merely
of
rapturous
pleasure
but
of
a
deep
sorrow
for
the
miseries
of
human
life
the
orphic
societies
of
greece
seem
to
have
been
peculiarly
ascetic
taking
no
animal
food
save
raw
flesh
from
the
sacrificed
ox
of
dionusos
and
plato
speaks
of
a
lower
grade
of
orphic
priests
orpheotelestai
who
used
to
come
before
the
doors
of
the
rich
and
promise
by
sacrifices
and
expiatory
songs
to
release
them
from
their
own
sins
and
those
of
their
forefathers
and
such
would
be
but
too
likely
to
get
a
hearing
from
the
man
who
was
afraid
of
a
weasel
or
an
owl
now
this
same
bodily
fear
i
verily
believe
will
be
found
at
the
root
of
all
superstition
whatsoever
but
be
it
so
fear
is
a
natural
passion
and
a
wholesome
one
without
the
instinct
of
which
causes
the
anemone
to
contract
its
tentacles
or
the
fish
to
dash
into
its
hover
species
would
be
extermined
wholesale
by
involuntary
suicide
yes
fear
is
wholesome
enough
like
all
other
faculties
as
long
as
it
is
controlled
by
reason
but
what
if
the
fear
be
not
rational
but
irrational
what
if
it
be
in
plain
homely
english
blind
fear
fear
of
the
unknown
simply
because
it
is
unknown
is
it
not
likely
then
to
be
afraid
of
the
wrong
object
to
be
hurtful
ruinous
to
animals
as
well
as
to
man
any
one
will
confess
that
who
has
ever
seen
a
horse
inflict
on
himself
mortal
injuries
in
his
frantic
attempts
to
escape
from
a
quite
imaginary
danger
i
have
good
reasons
for
believing
that
not
only
animals
here
and
there
but
whole
flocks
and
swarms
of
them
are
often
destroyed
even
in
the
wild
state
by
mistaken
fear
by
such
panics
for
instance
as
cause
a
whole
herd
of
buffaloes
to
rush
over
a
bluff
and
be
dashed
to
pieces
and
remark
that
this
capacity
of
panic
fear
of
superstition
as
i
should
call
it
is
greatest
in
those
animals
the
dog
and
the
horse
for
instance
which
have
the
most
rapid
and
vivid
fancy
does
not
the
unlettered
highlander
say
all
that
i
want
to
say
when
he
attributes
to
his
dog
and
his
horse
on
the
strength
of
these
very
manifestations
of
fear
the
capacity
of
seeing
ghosts
and
fairies
before
he
can
see
them
himself
but
blind
fear
not
only
causes
evil
to
the
coward
himself
it
makes
him
a
source
of
evil
to
others
for
it
is
the
cruellest
of
all
human
states
it
transforms
the
man
into
the
likeness
of
the
cat
who
when
she
is
caught
in
a
trap
or
shut
up
in
a
room
has
too
low
an
intellect
to
understand
that
you
wish
to
release
her
and
in
the
madness
of
terror
bites
and
tears
at
the
hand
which
tries
to
do
her
good
yes
very
cruel
is
blind
fear
when
a
man
dreads
he
knows
not
what
he
will
do
he
cares
not
what
when
he
dreads
desperately
he
will
act
desperately
when
he
dreads
beyond
all
reason
he
will
behave
beyond
all
reason
he
has
no
law
of
guidance
left
save
the
lowest
selfishness
no
law
of
guidance
and
yet
his
intellect
left
unguided
may
be
rapid
and
acute
enough
to
lead
him
into
terrible
follies
infinitely
more
imaginative
than
the
lowest
animals
he
is
for
that
very
reason
capable
of
being
infinitely
more
foolish
more
cowardly
more
superstitious
he
can
what
the
lower
animals
happily
for
them
can
not
organise
his
folly
erect
his
superstitions
into
a
science
and
create
a
whole
mythology
out
of
his
blind
fear
of
the
unknown
and
when
he
has
done
that
woe
to
the
weak
for
when
he
has
reduced
his
superstition
to
a
science
then
he
will
reduce
his
cruelty
to
a
science
likewise
and
write
books
like
the
malleus
maleficarum
and
the
rest
of
the
witch
literature
of
the
fifteenth
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
of
which
lecky
has
of
late
told
the
world
so
much
and
told
it
most
faithfully
and
most
fairly
but
fear
of
the
unknown
is
not
that
fear
of
the
unseen
world
and
is
not
that
fear
of
the
spiritual
world
pardon
me
a
great
deal
of
that
fear
all
of
it
indeed
which
is
superstition
is
simply
not
fear
of
the
spiritual
but
of
the
material
and
of
nothing
else
the
spiritual
world
i
beg
you
to
fix
this
in
your
minds
is
not
merely
an
invisible
world
which
may
become
visible
but
an
invisible
world
which
is
by
its
essence
invisible
a
moral
world
a
world
of
right
and
wrong
and
spiritual
fear
which
is
one
of
the
noblest
of
all
affections
as
bodily
fear
is
one
of
the
basest
is
if
properly
defined
nothing
less
or
more
than
the
fear
of
doing
wrong
of
becoming
a
worse
man
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
mere
fear
of
the
unseen
the
fancy
which
conceives
the
fear
is
physical
not
spiritual
think
for
yourselves
what
difference
is
there
between
a
savage
fear
of
a
demon
and
a
hunter
fear
of
a
fall
the
hunter
sees
a
fence
he
does
not
know
what
is
on
the
other
side
but
he
has
seen
fences
like
it
with
a
great
ditch
on
the
other
side
and
suspects
one
here
likewise
he
has
seen
horses
fall
at
such
and
men
hurt
thereby
he
pictures
to
himself
his
horse
falling
at
that
fence
himself
rolling
in
the
ditch
with
possibly
a
broken
limb
and
he
recoils
from
the
picture
he
himself
has
made
and
perhaps
with
very
good
reason
his
picture
may
have
its
counterpart
in
fact
and
he
may
break
his
leg
but
his
picture
like
the
previous
pictures
from
which
it
was
compounded
is
simply
a
physical
impression
on
the
brain
just
as
much
as
those
in
dreams
now
does
the
fact
of
the
ditch
the
fall
and
the
broken
leg
being
unseen
and
unknown
make
them
a
spiritual
ditch
a
spiritual
fall
a
spiritual
broken
leg
and
does
the
fact
of
the
demon
and
his
doings
being
as
yet
unseen
and
unknown
make
them
spiritual
or
the
harm
that
he
may
do
a
spiritual
harm
what
does
the
savage
fear
lest
the
demon
should
appear
that
is
become
obvious
to
his
physical
senses
and
produce
an
unpleasant
physical
effect
on
them
he
fears
lest
the
fiend
should
entice
him
into
the
bog
break
the
over
the
brook
turn
into
a
horse
and
ride
away
with
him
or
jump
out
from
behind
a
tree
and
wring
his
neck
tolerably
hard
physical
facts
all
of
them
the
children
of
physical
fancy
regarded
with
physical
dread
even
if
the
superstition
proved
true
even
if
the
demon
did
appear
even
if
he
wrung
the
traveller
neck
in
sound
earnest
there
would
be
no
more
spiritual
agency
or
phenomenon
in
the
whole
tragedy
than
there
is
in
the
when
spiritual
somethings
make
spiritual
raps
upon
spiritual
wood
and
human
beings
who
are
really
spirits
and
would
to
heaven
they
would
remember
that
fact
and
what
it
means
believe
that
anything
has
happened
beyond
a
clumsy
juggler
trick
you
demur
do
you
not
see
that
the
demon
by
the
mere
fact
of
having
produced
physical
consequences
would
have
become
himself
a
physical
agent
a
member
of
physical
nature
and
therefore
to
be
explained
he
and
his
doings
by
physical
laws
if
you
do
not
see
that
conclusion
at
first
sight
think
over
it
till
you
do
it
may
seem
to
some
that
i
have
founded
my
theory
on
a
very
narrow
basis
that
i
am
building
up
an
inverted
pyramid
or
that
considering
the
numberless
complex
fantastic
shapes
which
superstition
has
assumed
bodily
fear
is
too
simple
to
explain
them
all
but
if
those
persons
will
think
a
second
time
they
must
agree
that
my
base
is
as
broad
as
the
phenomena
which
it
explains
for
every
man
is
capable
of
fear
and
they
will
see
too
that
the
cause
of
superstition
must
be
something
like
fear
which
is
common
to
all
men
for
all
at
least
as
children
are
capable
of
superstition
and
that
it
must
be
something
which
like
fear
is
of
a
most
simple
rudimentary
barbaric
kind
for
the
lowest
savage
of
whatever
he
is
not
capable
is
still
superstitious
often
to
a
very
ugly
degree
superstition
seems
indeed
to
be
next
to
the
making
of
weapons
the
earliest
method
of
asserting
his
superiority
to
the
brutes
which
has
occurred
to
that
utterly
abnormal
and
fantastic
lusus
naturae
called
man
now
let
us
put
ourselves
awhile
as
far
as
we
can
in
the
place
of
that
same
savage
and
try
whether
my
theory
will
not
justify
itself
whether
or
not
superstition
with
all
its
vagaries
may
have
been
indeed
must
have
been
the
result
of
that
ignorance
and
fear
which
he
carried
about
with
him
every
time
he
prowled
for
food
through
the
primeval
forest
a
savage
first
division
of
nature
would
be
i
should
say
into
things
which
he
can
eat
and
things
which
can
eat
him
including
of
course
his
most
formidable
enemy
and
most
savoury
food
his
in
finding
out
what
he
can
eat
we
must
remember
he
will
have
gone
through
much
experience
which
will
have
inspired
him
with
a
serious
respect
for
the
hidden
wrath
of
nature
like
those
himalayan
folk
of
whom
hooker
says
that
as
they
know
every
poisonous
plant
they
must
have
tried
them
all
not
always
with
impunity
so
he
gets
at
a
third
class
of
objects
things
which
he
can
not
eat
and
which
will
not
eat
him
but
will
only
do
him
harm
as
it
seems
to
him
out
of
pure
malice
like
poisonous
plants
and
serpents
there
are
natural
accidents
too
which
fall
into
the
same
category
stones
floods
fires
avalanches
they
hurt
him
or
kill
him
surely
for
ends
of
their
own
if
a
rock
falls
from
the
cliff
above
him
what
more
natural
than
to
suppose
that
there
is
some
giant
up
there
who
threw
it
at
him
if
he
had
been
up
there
and
strong
enough
and
had
seen
a
man
walking
underneath
he
would
certainly
have
thrown
the
stone
at
him
and
killed
him
for
first
he
might
have
eaten
the
man
after
and
even
if
he
were
not
hungry
the
man
might
have
done
him
a
mischief
and
it
was
prudent
to
prevent
that
by
doing
him
a
mischief
first
besides
the
man
might
have
a
wife
and
if
he
killed
the
man
then
the
wife
would
by
a
very
ancient
law
common
to
man
and
animals
become
the
prize
of
the
victor
such
is
the
natural
man
the
carnal
man
the
soulish
man
the
greek
of
paul
with
five
tolerably
acute
senses
which
are
ruled
by
five
very
acute
animal
passions
hunger
sex
rage
vanity
fear
it
is
with
the
working
of
the
last
passion
fear
that
this
lecture
has
to
do
so
the
savage
concludes
that
there
must
be
a
giant
living
in
the
cliff
who
threw
stones
at
him
with
evil
intent
and
he
concludes
in
like
wise
concerning
most
other
natural
phenomena
there
is
something
in
them
which
will
hurt
him
and
therefore
likes
to
hurt
him
and
if
he
can
not
destroy
them
and
so
deliver
himself
his
fear
of
them
grows
quite
boundless
there
are
hundreds
of
natural
objects
on
which
he
learns
to
look
with
the
same
eyes
as
the
little
boys
of
teneriffe
look
on
the
useless
and
poisonous
euphorbia
canariensis
it
is
to
them
according
to
piazzi
smyth
a
demon
who
would
kill
them
if
it
could
only
run
after
them
but
as
it
can
not
they
shout
spanish
curses
at
it
and
pelt
it
with
volleys
of
stones
screeching
with
elfin
joy
and
using
worse
names
than
ever
when
the
poisonous
milk
spurts
out
from
its
bruised
stalks
and
if
such
be
the
attitude
of
the
uneducated
man
towards
the
permanent
terrors
of
nature
what
will
it
be
towards
those
which
are
sudden
and
seemingly
capricious
towards
storms
earthquakes
floods
blights
pestilences
we
know
too
well
what
it
has
been
one
of
blind
and
therefore
often
cruel
fear
how
could
it
be
otherwise
was
theophrastus
superstitious
man
so
very
foolish
for
pouring
oil
on
every
round
stone
i
think
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
him
this
worship
of
baetyli
was
rational
enough
they
were
aerolites
fallen
from
heaven
was
it
not
as
well
to
be
civil
to
such
messengers
from
above
to
testify
by
homage
to
them
due
awe
of
the
being
who
had
thrown
them
at
men
and
who
though
he
had
missed
his
shot
that
time
might
not
miss
it
the
next
i
think
if
we
knowing
nothing
of
either
gunpowder
astronomy
or
christianity
saw
an
armstrong
bolt
fall
within
five
miles
of
london
we
should
be
inclined
to
be
very
respectful
to
it
indeed
so
the
aerolites
or
glacial
boulders
or
polished
stone
weapons
of
an
extinct
race
which
looked
like
aerolites
were
the
children
of
ouranos
the
heaven
and
had
souls
in
them
one
by
one
of
those
strange
transformations
in
which
the
logic
of
unreason
indulges
the
image
of
diana
of
the
ephesians
which
fell
down
from
jupiter
another
was
the
ancile
the
holy
shield
which
fell
from
the
same
place
in
the
days
of
numa
pompilius
and
was
the
guardian
genius
of
rome
and
several
more
became
notable
for
ages
why
not
the
uneducated
man
of
genius
unacquainted
alike
with
metaphysics
and
with
biology
sees
like
a
child
a
personality
in
every
strange
and
object
a
cloud
like
an
angel
may
be
an
angel
a
bit
of
crooked
root
like
a
man
may
be
a
man
turned
into
wood
perhaps
to
be
turned
back
again
at
its
own
will
an
erratic
block
has
arrived
where
it
is
by
strange
unknown
means
is
not
that
an
evidence
of
its
personality
either
it
has
flown
hither
itself
or
some
one
has
thrown
it
in
the
former
case
it
has
life
and
is
proportionally
formidable
in
the
latter
he
who
had
thrown
it
is
formidable
i
know
two
erratic
blocks
of
porphyry
i
believe
there
are
three
in
cornwall
lying
one
on
serpentine
one
i
think
on
slate
which
so
i
was
always
informed
as
a
boy
were
the
stones
which
kevern
threw
after
just
when
the
latter
stole
his
host
chalice
and
paten
and
ran
away
with
them
to
the
land
end
why
not
before
we
knew
anything
about
the
action
of
icebergs
and
glaciers
that
is
until
the
last
eighty
years
that
was
as
good
a
story
as
any
other
while
how
lifelike
these
boulders
are
let
a
great
poet
testify
for
the
fact
has
not
escaped
the
delicate
eye
of
wordsworth
as
a
huge
stone
is
sometimes
seen
to
lie
couched
on
the
bald
top
of
an
eminence
wonder
to
all
who
do
the
same
espy
by
what
means
it
could
thither
come
and
whence
so
that
it
seems
a
thing
endued
with
sense
like
a
crawled
forth
that
on
a
shelf
of
rock
or
sand
reposeth
there
to
sun
itself
to
the
civilised
poet
the
fancy
becomes
a
beautiful
simile
to
a
savage
poet
it
would
have
become
a
material
and
a
very
formidable
fact
he
stands
in
the
valley
and
looks
up
at
the
boulder
on
the
fells
he
is
puzzled
by
it
he
fears
it
at
last
he
makes
up
his
mind
it
is
alive
as
the
shadows
move
over
it
he
sees
it
move
may
it
not
sleep
there
all
day
and
prowl
for
prey
all
night
he
had
been
always
afraid
of
going
up
those
fells
now
he
will
never
go
there
is
a
monster
there
childish
enough
no
doubt
but
remember
that
the
savage
is
always
a
child
so
indeed
are
millions
as
well
clothed
housed
and
policed
as
ourselves
children
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
but
of
them
i
do
not
talk
because
happily
for
the
world
their
childishness
is
so
overlaid
by
the
result
of
other
men
manhood
by
an
atmosphere
of
civilisation
and
christianity
which
they
have
accepted
at
as
the
conclusions
of
minds
wiser
than
their
own
that
they
do
all
manner
of
reasonable
things
for
bad
reasons
or
for
no
reason
at
all
save
the
passion
of
imitation
not
in
them
but
in
the
savage
can
we
see
man
as
he
is
by
nature
the
puppet
of
his
senses
and
his
passions
the
natural
slave
of
his
own
fears
but
has
the
savage
no
other
faculties
save
his
five
senses
and
five
passions
i
do
not
say
that
i
should
be
most
unphilosophical
if
i
said
it
for
the
history
of
mankind
proves
that
he
has
infinitely
more
in
him
than
that
yes
but
in
him
that
infinite
more
which
is
not
only
the
noblest
part
of
humanity
but
it
may
be
humanity
itself
is
not
to
be
counted
as
one
of
the
roots
of
superstition
for
in
the
savage
man
in
whom
superstition
certainly
originates
that
infinite
more
is
still
merely
in
him
inside
him
a
faculty
but
not
yet
a
fact
it
has
not
come
out
of
him
into
consciousness
purpose
and
act
and
is
to
be
treated
as
while
what
has
come
out
his
passions
and
senses
is
enough
to
explain
all
the
vagaries
of
superstition
a
vera
causa
for
all
its
phenomena
and
if
we
seem
to
have
found
a
sufficient
explanation
already
it
is
unphilosophical
to
look
farther
at
least
till
we
have
tried
whether
our
explanation
fits
the
facts
nevertheless
there
is
another
faculty
in
the
savage
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
common
to
him
and
to
at
least
the
higher
vertebrates
fancy
the
power
of
reproducing
internal
images
of
external
objects
whether
in
its
waking
form
of
physical
memory
if
indeed
all
memory
be
not
physical
or
in
its
sleeping
form
of
dreaming
upon
this
last
which
has
played
so
very
important
a
part
in
superstition
in
all
ages
i
beg
you
to
think
a
moment
recollect
your
own
dreams
during
childhood
and
recollect
again
that
the
savage
is
always
a
child
recollect
how
difficult
it
was
for
you
in
childhood
how
difficult
it
must
be
always
for
the
savage
to
decide
whether
dreams
are
phantasms
or
realities
to
the
savage
i
doubt
not
the
food
he
eats
the
foes
he
grapples
with
in
dreams
are
as
real
as
any
waking
impressions
but
moreover
these
dreams
will
be
very
often
as
children
dreams
are
wont
to
be
of
a
painful
and
terrible
kind
perhaps
they
will
be
always
painful
perhaps
his
dull
brain
will
never
dream
save
under
the
influence
of
indigestion
or
hunger
or
an
uncomfortable
attitude
and
so
in
addition
to
his
waking
experience
of
the
terrors
of
nature
he
will
have
a
whole
besides
of
a
still
more
terrific
kind
he
walks
by
day
past
a
black
cavern
mouth
and
thinks
with
a
shudder
something
ugly
may
live
in
that
ugly
hole
what
if
it
jumped
out
upon
me
he
broods
over
the
thought
with
the
intensity
of
a
narrow
and
unoccupied
mind
and
a
few
nights
after
he
has
eaten
but
let
us
draw
a
veil
before
the
larder
of
a
savage
his
chin
is
pinned
down
on
his
chest
a
slight
congestion
of
the
brain
comes
on
and
behold
he
finds
himself
again
at
that
cavern
mouth
and
something
ugly
does
jump
out
upon
him
and
the
cavern
is
a
haunted
spot
henceforth
to
him
and
to
all
his
tribe
it
is
in
vain
that
his
family
tell
him
that
he
has
been
lying
asleep
at
home
all
the
while
he
has
the
evidence
of
his
senses
to
prove
the
contrary
he
must
have
got
out
of
himself
and
gone
into
the
woods
when
we
remember
that
certain
wise
greek
philosophers
could
find
no
better
explanation
of
dreaming
than
that
the
soul
left
the
body
and
wandered
free
we
can
not
condemn
the
savage
for
his
theory
now
i
submit
that
in
these
simple
facts
we
have
a
group
of
true
causes
which
are
the
roots
of
all
the
superstitions
of
the
world
and
if
any
one
shall
complain
that
i
am
talking
materialism
i
shall
answer
that
i
am
doing
exactly
the
opposite
i
am
trying
to
eliminate
and
get
rid
of
that
which
is
material
animal
and
base
in
order
that
that
which
is
truly
spiritual
may
stand
out
distinct
and
clear
in
its
divine
and
eternal
beauty
to
explain
and
at
the
same
time
as
i
think
to
verify
my
hypothesis
let
me
give
you
an
example
fictitious
it
is
true
but
probable
fact
nevertheless
because
it
is
patched
up
of
many
fragments
of
actual
fact
and
let
us
see
how
in
following
it
out
we
shall
pass
through
almost
every
possible
form
of
superstition
suppose
a
great
hollow
tree
in
which
the
formidable
wasps
of
the
tropics
have
built
for
ages
the
average
savage
hurries
past
the
spot
in
mere
bodily
fear
for
if
they
come
out
against
him
they
will
sting
him
to
death
till
at
last
there
comes
by
a
savage
wiser
than
the
rest
with
more
observation
reflection
imagination
independence
of
will
the
genius
of
his
tribe
the
awful
shade
of
the
great
tree
added
to
his
terror
of
the
wasps
weighs
on
him
and
excites
his
brain
perhaps
too
he
has
had
a
wife
or
a
child
stung
to
death
by
these
same
wasps
these
wasps
so
small
yet
so
wise
far
wiser
than
he
they
fly
and
they
sting
ah
if
he
could
fly
and
sting
how
he
would
kill
and
eat
and
live
right
merrily
they
build
great
towns
they
rob
far
and
wide
they
never
quarrel
with
each
other
they
must
have
some
one
to
teach
them
to
lead
them
they
must
have
a
king
and
so
he
gets
the
fancy
of
a
as
the
western
irish
still
believe
in
the
master
otter
as
the
red
men
believe
in
the
king
of
the
buffaloes
and
find
the
bones
of
his
ancestors
in
the
mammoth
remains
of
lick
as
the
philistines
of
ekron
to
quote
a
notorious
instance
actually
worshipped
lord
of
the
flies
if
they
have
a
king
he
must
be
inside
that
tree
of
course
if
he
the
savage
were
a
king
he
would
not
work
for
his
bread
but
sit
at
home
and
make
others
feed
him
and
so
no
doubt
does
the
and
when
he
goes
home
he
will
brood
over
this
wonderful
discovery
of
the
till
like
a
child
he
can
think
of
nothing
else
he
will
go
to
the
tree
and
watch
for
him
to
come
out
the
wasps
will
get
accustomed
to
his
motionless
figure
and
leave
him
unhurt
till
the
new
fancy
will
rise
in
his
mind
that
he
is
a
favourite
of
this
and
at
last
he
will
find
himself
grovelling
before
the
tree
saying
oh
great
pity
me
and
tell
your
children
not
to
sting
me
and
i
will
bring
you
honey
and
fruit
and
flowers
to
eat
and
i
will
flatter
you
and
worship
you
and
you
shall
be
my
king
and
then
he
would
gradually
boast
of
his
discovery
of
the
new
mysterious
bond
between
him
and
the
and
his
tribe
would
believe
him
and
fear
him
and
fear
him
still
more
when
he
began
to
say
as
he
surely
would
not
merely
i
can
ask
the
and
he
will
tell
his
children
not
to
sting
you
but
i
can
ask
the
and
he
will
send
his
children
and
sting
you
all
to
death
vanity
and
ambition
will
have
prompted
the
threat
but
it
will
not
be
altogether
a
lie
the
man
will
more
than
half
believe
his
own
words
he
will
quite
believe
them
when
he
has
repeated
them
a
dozen
times
and
so
he
will
become
a
great
man
and
a
king
under
the
protection
of
the
king
of
the
wasps
and
he
will
become
and
it
may
be
his
children
after
him
priest
of
the
who
will
be
their
fetish
and
the
fetish
of
their
tribe
and
they
will
prosper
under
the
protection
of
the
the
wasp
will
become
their
moral
ideal
whose
virtues
they
must
copy
the
new
chief
will
preach
to
them
wild
eloquent
words
they
must
sting
like
wasps
revenge
like
wasps
hold
altogether
like
wasps
build
like
wasps
work
hard
like
wasps
rob
like
wasps
then
like
the
wasps
they
will
be
the
terror
of
all
around
and
kill
and
eat
all
their
enemies
soon
they
will
call
themselves
the
wasps
they
will
boast
that
their
king
father
or
grandfather
and
soon
that
the
ancestor
of
the
whole
tribe
was
an
actual
wasp
and
the
wasp
will
become
at
once
their
eponym
hero
their
deity
their
ideal
their
civiliser
who
has
taught
them
to
build
a
kraal
of
huts
as
he
taught
his
children
to
build
a
hive
now
if
there
should
come
to
any
thinking
man
of
this
tribe
at
this
epoch
the
new
thought
who
made
the
world
he
will
be
sorely
puzzled
the
conception
of
a
world
has
never
crossed
his
mind
before
he
never
pictured
to
himself
anything
beyond
the
nearest
ridge
of
mountains
and
as
for
a
maker
that
will
be
a
greater
puzzle
still
what
makers
or
builders
more
cunning
than
those
wasps
of
whom
his
foolish
head
is
full
of
course
he
sees
it
now
a
wasp
made
the
world
which
to
him
entirely
new
guess
might
become
an
integral
part
of
his
tribe
creed
that
would
be
their
cosmogony
and
if
a
generation
or
two
after
another
savage
genius
should
guess
that
the
world
was
a
globe
hanging
in
the
heavens
he
would
if
he
had
imagination
enough
to
take
the
thought
in
at
all
put
it
to
himself
in
a
form
suited
to
his
previous
knowledge
and
conceptions
it
would
seem
to
him
that
the
wasp
flew
about
the
skies
with
the
world
in
his
mouth
as
he
carries
a
bluebottle
fly
and
that
would
be
the
astronomy
of
his
tribe
henceforth
absurd
enough
but
as
every
man
who
is
acquainted
with
old
mythical
cosmogonies
must
know
no
more
absurd
than
twenty
similar
guesses
on
record
try
to
imagine
the
gradual
genesis
of
such
myths
as
the
egyptian
scarabaeus
and
egg
or
the
hindoo
theory
that
the
world
stood
on
an
elephant
the
elephant
on
a
tortoise
the
tortoise
on
that
infinite
note
of
interrogation
which
as
some
one
expresses
it
underlies
all
physical
speculations
and
judge
must
they
not
have
arisen
in
some
such
fashion
as
that
which
i
have
pointed
out
this
i
say
would
be
the
culminating
point
of
the
which
had
sprung
up
out
of
bodily
fear
of
being
stung
but
times
might
come
for
it
in
which
it
would
go
through
various
changes
through
which
every
superstition
in
the
world
i
suppose
has
passed
or
is
doomed
to
pass
the
might
be
conquered
and
possibly
eaten
by
a
stronger
tribe
than
themselves
what
would
be
the
result
they
would
fight
valiantly
at
first
like
wasps
but
what
if
they
began
to
fail
was
not
the
angry
with
them
had
not
he
deserted
them
he
must
be
appeased
he
must
have
his
revenge
they
would
take
a
captive
and
offer
him
to
the
wasps
so
did
a
north
american
tribe
in
their
need
some
forty
years
ago
when
because
their
failed
they
roasted
alive
a
captive
girl
cut
her
to
pieces
and
sowed
her
with
their
corn
i
would
not
tell
the
story
for
the
horror
of
it
did
it
not
bear
with
such
fearful
force
on
my
argument
what
were
those
red
men
thinking
of
what
chain
of
misreasoning
had
they
in
their
heads
when
they
hit
on
that
as
a
device
for
making
the
crops
grow
who
can
tell
who
can
make
the
crooked
straight
or
number
that
which
is
wanting
as
said
solomon
of
old
so
must
we
the
foolishness
of
fools
is
folly
one
thing
only
we
can
say
of
them
that
they
were
horribly
afraid
of
famine
and
took
that
means
of
ridding
themselves
of
their
fear
but
what
if
the
wasp
tribe
had
no
captives
they
would
offer
slaves
what
if
the
agony
and
death
of
slaves
did
not
appease
the
wasps
they
would
offer
their
fairest
their
dearest
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
the
wasps
as
the
carthaginians
in
like
strait
offered
in
one
day
noble
boys
to
moloch
the
god
whose
worship
they
had
brought
out
of
syria
whose
original
meaning
they
had
probably
forgotten
of
whom
they
only
knew
that
he
was
a
dark
and
devouring
being
who
must
be
appeased
with
the
burning
bodies
of
their
sons
and
daughters
and
so
the
veil
of
fancy
would
be
lifted
again
and
the
whole
superstition
stand
forth
revealed
as
the
mere
offspring
of
bodily
fear
but
more
the
survivors
of
the
conquest
might
perhaps
escape
and
carry
their
into
a
new
land
but
if
they
became
poor
and
weakly
their
brains
and
imagination
degenerating
with
their
bodies
would
degrade
their
till
they
knew
not
what
it
meant
away
from
the
sacred
tree
in
a
country
the
wasps
of
which
were
not
so
large
or
formidable
they
would
require
a
remembrancer
of
the
and
they
would
make
one
a
wasp
of
wood
or
what
not
after
a
while
according
to
that
strange
law
of
fancy
the
root
of
all
idolatry
which
you
may
see
at
work
in
every
child
who
plays
with
a
doll
the
symbol
would
become
identified
with
the
thing
symbolised
they
would
invest
the
wooden
wasp
with
all
the
terrible
attributes
which
had
belonged
to
the
live
wasps
of
the
tree
and
after
a
few
centuries
when
all
remembrance
of
the
tree
the
prophet
and
chieftain
and
his
descent
from
the
divine
wasp
ay
even
of
their
defeat
and
flight
had
vanished
from
their
songs
and
legends
they
would
be
found
bowing
down
in
fear
and
trembling
to
a
little
ancient
wooden
wasp
which
came
from
they
knew
not
whence
and
meant
they
knew
not
what
save
that
it
was
a
very
old
fetish
a
great
medicine
or
some
such
other
formula
for
expressing
their
own
ignorance
and
dread
just
so
do
the
natives
of
thibet
and
the
irishwomen
of
kerry
by
a
strange
coincidence
unless
the
ancient
irish
were
buddhists
like
the
himalayans
tie
just
the
same
scraps
of
rag
on
the
bushes
round
just
the
same
holy
wells
as
do
the
negros
of
central
africa
upon
their
trees
they
know
not
why
save
that
their
ancestors
did
it
and
it
is
a
charm
against
and
danger
and
the
sacred
tree
that
too
might
undergo
a
metamorphosis
in
the
minds
of
men
the
conquerors
would
see
their
aboriginal
slaves
of
the
old
race
still
haunting
the
tree
making
stealthy
offerings
to
it
by
night
and
they
would
ask
the
reason
but
they
would
not
be
told
the
secret
would
be
guarded
such
secrets
were
guarded
in
greece
in
italy
in
medieval
france
by
the
superstitious
awe
the
cunning
even
the
hidden
of
the
conquered
race
then
the
conquerors
would
wish
to
imitate
their
own
slaves
they
might
be
in
the
right
there
might
be
something
magical
uncanny
in
the
hollow
tree
which
might
hurt
them
might
be
jealous
of
them
as
intruders
they
too
would
invest
the
place
with
sacred
awe
if
they
were
gloomy
like
the
teutonic
conquerors
of
europe
and
the
arabian
conquerors
of
the
east
they
would
invest
it
with
unseen
terrors
they
would
say
like
them
a
devil
lives
in
the
tree
if
they
were
of
a
sunny
temper
like
the
hellenes
they
would
invest
it
with
unseen
graces
what
a
noble
tree
what
a
fair
fountain
hard
by
its
roots
surely
some
fair
and
graceful
being
must
dwell
therein
and
come
out
to
bathe
by
night
in
that
clear
wave
what
meant
the
fruit
the
flowers
the
honey
which
the
slaves
left
there
by
night
pure
food
for
some
pure
nymph
the
would
be
forgotten
probably
smoked
out
as
sacrilegious
intruders
the
lucky
seer
or
poet
who
struck
out
the
fancy
would
soon
find
imitators
and
it
would
become
after
a
while
a
common
and
popular
superstition
that
hamadryads
haunted
the
hollow
forest
trees
naiads
the
wells
and
oreads
the
lawns
somewhat
thus
i
presume
did
the
more
cheerful
hellenic
myths
displace
the
darker
superstitions
of
the
pelasgis
and
those
rude
arcadian
tribes
who
offered
even
as
late
as
the
roman
empire
human
sacrifices
to
gods
whose
original
names
were
forgotten
but
even
the
cultus
of
nymphs
would
be
defiled
after
awhile
by
a
darker
element
however
fair
they
might
be
capricious
and
revengeful
like
other
women
why
not
and
soon
men
going
out
into
the
forest
would
be
missed
for
awhile
they
had
eaten
narcotic
berries
got
wandered
till
they
lost
their
wits
at
all
events
their
wits
were
gone
who
had
done
it
who
but
the
nymphs
the
men
had
seen
something
they
should
not
have
seen
done
something
they
would
not
have
done
and
the
nymphs
had
punished
the
unconscious
rudeness
by
that
frenzy
fear
everywhere
fear
of
nature
the
spotted
panther
as
some
one
calls
her
as
fair
as
cruel
as
playful
as
treacherous
always
fear
of
nature
till
a
divine
light
arise
and
show
men
that
they
are
not
the
puppets
of
nature
but
her
lords
and
that
they
are
to
fear
god
and
fear
naught
else
and
so
ends
my
true
myth
of
the
no
it
need
not
end
there
it
may
develop
into
a
yet
darker
and
more
hideous
form
of
superstition
which
europe
has
often
seen
which
is
common
now
among
the
negros
which
we
may
hope
will
soon
be
exterminated
this
might
happen
for
it
or
something
like
it
has
happened
too
many
times
already
that
to
the
ancient
women
who
still
kept
up
the
irrational
remnant
of
the
beneath
the
sacred
tree
other
women
might
resort
not
merely
from
curiosity
or
an
excited
imagination
but
from
jealousy
and
revenge
oppressed
as
woman
has
always
been
under
the
reign
of
brute
force
beaten
outraged
deserted
at
best
married
against
her
will
she
has
too
often
gone
for
comfort
and
help
and
those
of
the
very
darkest
kind
to
the
works
of
darkness
and
there
never
were
wanting
there
are
not
wanting
even
now
in
remote
parts
of
these
isles
wicked
old
women
who
would
by
help
of
the
old
superstitions
do
for
her
what
she
wished
soon
would
follow
mysterious
deaths
of
rivals
of
husbands
of
babes
then
rumours
of
dark
rites
connected
with
the
sacred
tree
with
poison
with
the
wasp
and
his
sting
with
human
sacrifices
lies
mingled
with
truth
more
and
more
confused
and
frantic
the
more
they
were
misinvestigated
by
men
mad
with
fear
till
there
would
arise
one
of
those
which
are
too
common
still
among
the
african
negros
which
were
too
common
of
old
among
the
men
of
our
race
i
say
among
the
men
to
comprehend
a
you
must
look
at
it
as
what
the
confesses
it
unblushingly
to
be
man
dread
of
nature
excited
to
its
highest
form
as
dread
of
woman
she
is
to
the
barbarous
man
she
should
be
more
and
more
to
the
civilised
man
not
only
the
most
beautiful
and
precious
but
the
most
wonderful
and
mysterious
of
all
natural
objects
if
it
be
only
as
the
author
of
his
physical
being
she
is
to
the
savage
a
miracle
to
be
alternately
adored
and
dreaded
he
dreads
her
more
delicate
nervous
organisation
which
often
takes
shapes
to
him
demoniacal
and
miraculous
her
quicker
instincts
her
readier
wit
which
seem
to
him
to
have
in
them
somewhat
prophetic
and
superhuman
which
entangled
him
as
in
an
invisible
net
and
rule
him
against
his
will
he
dreads
her
very
tongue
more
crushing
than
his
heaviest
club
more
keen
than
his
poisoned
arrows
he
dreads
those
habits
of
secrecy
and
falsehood
the
weapons
of
the
weak
to
which
savage
and
degraded
woman
always
has
recourse
he
dreads
the
very
medicinal
skill
which
she
has
learnt
to
exercise
as
nurse
comforter
and
slave
he
dreads
those
secret
ceremonies
those
mysterious
initiations
which
no
man
may
witness
which
he
has
permitted
to
her
in
all
ages
in
so
many
if
not
all
barbarous
and
races
whether
negro
american
syrian
greek
or
roman
as
a
homage
to
the
mysterious
importance
of
her
who
brings
him
into
the
world
if
she
turns
against
him
she
with
all
her
unknown
powers
she
who
is
the
sharer
of
his
deepest
secrets
who
prepares
his
very
food
day
by
day
what
harm
can
she
not
may
she
not
do
and
that
she
has
good
reason
to
turn
against
him
he
knows
too
well
what
deliverance
is
there
from
this
mysterious
save
brute
force
terror
torture
murder
must
be
the
order
of
the
day
woman
must
be
crushed
at
all
price
by
the
blind
fear
of
the
man
i
shall
say
no
more
i
shall
draw
a
veil
for
very
pity
and
shame
over
the
most
important
and
most
significant
facts
of
this
the
most
hideous
of
all
human
follies
i
have
i
think
given
you
hints
enough
to
show
that
it
like
all
other
superstitions
is
the
child
the
last
born
and
the
ugliest
child
of
blind
dread
of
the
unknown
science
i
said
that
superstition
was
the
child
of
fear
and
fear
the
child
of
ignorance
and
you
might
expect
me
to
say
antithetically
that
science
was
the
child
of
courage
and
courage
the
child
of
knowledge
but
these
genealogies
like
most
metaphors
do
not
fit
exactly
as
you
may
see
for
yourselves
if
fear
be
the
child
of
ignorance
ignorance
is
also
the
child
of
fear
the
two
react
on
and
produce
each
other
the
more
men
dread
nature
the
less
they
wish
to
know
about
her
why
pry
into
her
awful
secrets
it
is
dangerous
perhaps
impious
she
says
to
them
as
in
the
egyptian
temple
of
old
i
am
isis
and
my
veil
no
mortal
yet
hath
lifted
and
why
should
they
try
or
wish
to
lift
it
if
she
will
leave
them
in
peace
they
will
leave
her
in
peace
it
is
enough
that
she
does
not
destroy
them
so
as
ignorance
bred
fear
fear
breeds
fresh
and
willing
ignorance
and
courage
we
may
say
and
truly
that
courage
is
the
child
of
knowledge
but
we
may
say
as
truly
that
knowledge
is
the
child
of
courage
those
egyptian
priests
in
the
temple
of
isis
would
have
told
you
that
knowledge
was
the
child
of
mystery
of
special
illumination
of
reverence
and
what
not
hiding
under
grand
words
their
purpose
of
keeping
the
masses
ignorant
that
they
might
be
their
slaves
reverence
i
will
yield
to
none
in
reverence
for
reverence
i
will
all
but
agree
with
the
wise
man
who
said
that
reverence
is
the
root
of
all
virtues
but
which
child
reverences
his
father
most
he
who
comes
joyfully
and
trustfully
to
meet
him
that
he
may
learn
his
father
mind
and
do
his
will
or
he
who
at
his
father
coming
runs
away
and
hides
lest
he
should
be
beaten
for
he
knows
not
what
there
is
a
scientific
reverence
a
reverence
of
courage
which
is
surely
one
of
the
highest
forms
of
reverence
that
namely
which
so
reveres
every
fact
that
it
dare
not
overlook
or
falsify
it
seem
it
never
so
minute
which
feels
that
because
it
is
a
fact
it
can
not
be
minute
can
not
be
unimportant
that
it
must
be
a
fact
of
god
a
message
from
god
a
voice
of
god
as
bacon
has
it
revealed
in
things
and
which
therefore
just
because
it
stands
in
solemn
awe
of
such
paltry
facts
as
the
scolopax
feather
in
a
snipe
pinion
or
the
jagged
leaves
which
appear
capriciously
in
certain
honeysuckles
believes
that
there
is
likely
to
be
some
deep
and
wide
secret
underlying
them
which
is
worth
years
of
thought
to
solve
that
is
reverence
a
reverence
which
is
growing
thank
god
more
and
more
common
which
will
produce
as
it
grows
more
common
still
fruit
which
generations
yet
unborn
shall
bless
but
as
for
that
other
reverence
which
shuts
its
eyes
and
ears
in
pious
awe
what
is
it
but
cowardice
decked
out
in
state
robes
putting
on
the
sacred
urim
and
thummim
not
that
men
may
ask
counsel
of
the
deity
but
that
they
may
not
what
is
it
but
cowardice
very
pitiable
when
unmasked
and
what
is
its
child
but
ignorance
as
pitiable
which
would
be
ludicrous
were
it
not
so
injurious
if
a
man
comes
up
to
nature
as
to
a
parrot
or
a
monkey
with
this
prevailing
thought
in
his
head
will
it
bite
me
will
he
not
be
pretty
certain
to
make
up
his
mind
that
it
may
bite
him
and
had
therefore
best
be
left
alone
it
is
only
the
man
of
courage
few
and
far
between
who
will
stand
the
chance
of
a
first
bite
in
the
hope
of
teaching
the
parrot
to
talk
or
the
monkey
to
fire
off
a
gun
and
it
is
only
the
man
of
courage
few
and
far
between
who
will
stand
the
chance
of
a
first
bite
from
nature
which
may
kill
him
for
aught
he
knows
for
her
teeth
though
clumsy
are
very
strong
in
order
that
he
may
tame
her
and
break
her
in
to
his
use
by
the
very
same
method
by
which
that
admirable
inductive
philosopher
rarey
used
to
break
in
his
horses
first
by
not
being
afraid
of
them
and
next
by
trying
to
find
out
what
they
were
thinking
of
but
after
all
as
with
animals
so
with
nature
cowardice
is
dangerous
the
surest
method
of
getting
bitten
by
an
animal
is
to
be
afraid
of
it
and
the
surest
method
of
being
injured
by
nature
is
to
be
afraid
of
it
only
as
far
as
we
understand
nature
are
we
safe
from
it
and
those
who
in
any
age
counsel
mankind
not
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
the
universe
counsel
them
not
to
provide
for
their
own
life
and
or
for
their
children
after
them
but
how
few
there
have
been
in
any
age
who
have
not
been
afraid
of
nature
how
few
have
set
themselves
like
rarey
to
tame
her
by
finding
out
what
she
is
thinking
of
the
mass
are
glad
to
have
the
results
of
science
as
they
are
to
buy
rarey
horses
after
they
are
tamed
but
for
want
of
courage
or
of
wit
they
had
rather
leave
the
taming
process
to
someone
else
and
therefore
we
may
say
that
what
knowledge
of
nature
we
have
and
we
have
very
little
we
owe
to
the
courage
of
those
men
and
they
have
been
very
few
who
have
been
inspired
to
face
nature
boldly
and
say
or
what
is
better
act
as
if
they
were
saying
i
find
something
in
me
which
i
do
not
find
in
you
which
gives
me
the
hope
that
i
can
grow
to
understand
you
though
you
may
not
understand
me
that
i
may
become
your
master
and
not
as
now
you
mine
and
if
not
i
will
know
or
die
in
the
search
it
is
to
those
men
the
few
and
far
between
in
a
very
few
ages
and
very
few
countries
who
have
thus
risen
in
rebellion
against
nature
and
looked
it
in
the
face
with
an
unquailing
glance
that
we
owe
what
we
call
physical
science
there
have
been
four
races
or
rather
a
very
few
men
of
each
four
races
who
have
faced
nature
after
this
gallant
wise
first
the
old
jews
i
speak
of
them
be
it
remembered
exclusively
from
an
historical
and
not
a
religious
point
of
view
these
people
at
a
very
remote
epoch
emerged
from
a
country
highly
civilised
but
sunk
in
the
superstitions
of
they
invaded
and
mingled
with
tribes
whose
superstitions
were
even
more
debased
silly
and
foul
than
those
of
the
egyptians
from
whom
they
escaped
their
own
masses
were
for
centuries
given
up
to
worship
now
among
those
jews
arose
men
a
very
few
sages
prophets
call
them
what
you
will
the
men
were
inspired
heroes
and
philosophers
who
assumed
towards
nature
an
attitude
utterly
different
from
the
rest
of
their
countrymen
and
the
rest
of
the
then
world
who
denounced
superstition
and
the
dread
of
nature
as
the
parent
of
all
manner
of
vice
and
misery
who
for
themselves
said
boldly
that
they
discerned
in
the
universe
an
order
a
unity
a
permanence
of
law
which
gave
them
courage
instead
of
fear
they
found
delight
and
not
dread
in
the
thought
that
the
universe
obeyed
a
law
which
could
not
be
broken
that
all
things
continued
to
that
day
according
to
a
certain
ordinance
they
took
a
view
of
nature
totally
new
in
that
age
healthy
human
cheerful
loving
trustful
and
yet
reverent
identical
with
that
which
happily
is
beginning
to
prevail
in
our
own
day
they
defied
those
very
volcanic
and
meteoric
phenomena
of
their
land
to
which
their
countrymen
were
slaying
their
own
children
in
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
and
like
theophrastus
superstitious
man
pouring
their
on
the
smooth
stones
of
the
valley
and
declared
that
for
their
part
they
would
not
fear
though
the
earth
was
moved
and
though
the
hills
were
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
though
the
waters
raged
and
swelled
and
the
mountains
shook
at
the
tempest
the
fact
is
indisputable
and
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
express
my
belief
that
these
men
if
they
had
felt
it
their
business
to
found
a
school
of
inductive
physical
science
would
owing
to
that
temper
of
mind
have
achieved
a
very
signal
success
i
ground
that
opinion
on
the
remarkable
but
equally
indisputable
fact
that
no
nation
has
ever
succeeded
in
perpetuating
a
school
of
inductive
physical
science
save
those
whose
minds
have
been
saturated
with
this
same
view
of
nature
which
they
have
as
an
historic
fact
slowly
but
thoroughly
learnt
from
the
writings
of
these
jewish
sages
such
is
the
fact
the
founders
of
inductive
physical
science
were
not
the
jews
but
first
the
chaldaeans
next
the
greeks
next
their
pupils
the
romans
or
rather
a
few
sages
among
each
race
but
what
success
had
they
the
chaldaean
astronomers
made
a
few
discoveries
concerning
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
which
rudimentary
as
they
were
still
prove
them
to
have
been
men
of
rare
intellect
for
a
great
and
a
patient
genius
must
he
have
been
who
first
distinguished
the
planets
from
the
fixed
stars
or
worked
out
the
earliest
astronomical
calculation
but
they
seem
to
have
been
crushed
as
it
were
by
their
own
discoveries
they
stopped
short
they
gave
way
again
to
the
primeval
fear
of
nature
they
sank
into
they
invented
it
would
seem
that
fantastic
of
astrology
which
lay
for
ages
after
as
an
incubus
on
the
human
intellect
and
conscience
they
became
the
magicians
and
quacks
of
the
old
world
and
mankind
owed
them
thenceforth
nothing
but
evil
among
the
greeks
and
romans
again
those
sages
who
dared
face
nature
like
reasonable
men
were
accused
by
the
superstitious
mob
as
irreverent
impious
atheists
the
wisest
of
them
all
socrates
was
actually
put
to
death
on
that
charge
and
finally
they
failed
school
after
school
in
greece
and
rome
struggled
to
discover
and
to
get
a
hearing
for
some
theory
of
the
universe
which
was
founded
on
something
like
experience
reason
common
sense
they
were
not
allowed
to
prosecute
their
attempt
the
of
ignorance
and
fear
in
which
they
struggled
so
manfully
was
too
strong
for
them
the
closed
over
their
heads
finally
as
the
age
of
the
antonines
expired
and
the
last
effort
of
thought
to
explain
the
universe
was
neoplatonism
the
muddiest
of
the
muddy
an
attempt
to
apologise
for
and
organise
into
a
system
all
the
superstitions
of
the
roman
world
porphyry
plotinus
proclus
poor
hypatia
herself
and
all
her
school
they
may
have
had
themselves
no
bodily
fear
of
nature
for
they
were
noble
souls
yet
they
spent
their
time
in
justifying
those
who
had
in
apologising
for
the
superstitions
of
the
very
mob
which
they
despised
just
as
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
some
folk
in
these
days
are
like
to
end
in
doing
begging
that
the
masses
might
be
allowed
to
believe
in
anything
however
false
lest
they
should
believe
in
nothing
at
all
as
if
believing
in
lies
could
do
anything
but
harm
to
any
human
being
and
so
died
the
science
of
the
old
world
in
a
true
second
childhood
just
where
it
began
the
jewish
sages
i
hold
taught
that
science
was
probable
the
greeks
and
romans
proved
that
it
was
possible
it
remained
for
our
race
under
the
teaching
of
both
to
bring
science
into
act
and
fact
many
causes
contributed
to
give
them
this
power
they
were
a
personally
courageous
race
this
earth
has
yet
seen
no
braver
men
than
the
forefathers
of
christian
europe
whether
scandinavian
or
teuton
angle
or
frank
they
were
a
practical
race
with
a
strong
appreciation
of
facts
and
a
strong
determination
to
act
on
them
their
laws
their
society
their
commerce
their
colonisation
their
migrations
by
land
and
sea
proved
that
they
were
such
they
were
favoured
moreover
by
circumstances
or
as
i
should
rather
put
it
by
that
divine
providence
which
determined
their
times
and
the
bounds
of
their
habitation
they
came
in
as
the
heritors
of
the
decaying
civilisation
of
greece
and
rome
they
colonised
territories
which
gave
to
man
special
fair
play
but
no
more
in
the
struggle
for
existence
the
battle
with
the
powers
of
nature
tolerably
fertile
tolerably
temperate
with
boundless
means
of
water
communication
freer
than
most
parts
of
the
world
from
those
terrible
natural
phenomena
like
the
earthquake
and
the
hurricane
before
which
man
lies
helpless
and
astounded
a
child
beneath
the
foot
of
a
giant
nature
was
to
them
not
so
inhospitable
as
to
starve
their
brains
and
limbs
as
it
has
done
for
the
esquimaux
or
fuegian
and
not
so
bountiful
as
to
crush
them
by
its
very
luxuriance
as
it
has
crushed
the
savages
of
the
tropics
they
saw
enough
of
its
strength
to
respect
it
not
enough
to
cower
before
it
and
they
and
it
have
fought
it
out
and
it
seems
to
me
standing
either
on
london
bridge
or
on
a
holland
that
they
are
winning
at
last
but
they
had
a
sore
battle
a
battle
against
their
own
fear
of
the
unseen
they
brought
with
them
out
of
the
heart
of
asia
dark
and
sad
some
of
which
linger
among
our
peasantry
till
this
day
of
elves
trolls
nixes
and
what
not
their
thor
and
odin
were
at
first
probably
only
the
thunder
and
the
wind
but
they
had
to
be
appeased
in
the
dark
marches
of
the
forest
where
hung
rotting
on
the
sacred
oaks
amid
carcases
of
goat
and
horse
the
carcases
of
human
victims
no
one
acquainted
with
the
early
legends
and
ballads
of
our
race
but
must
perceive
throughout
them
all
the
prevailing
tone
of
fear
and
sadness
and
to
their
own
superstitions
they
added
those
of
the
rome
which
they
conquered
they
dreaded
the
roman
and
witches
who
like
canidia
still
performed
horrid
rites
in
graveyards
and
dark
places
of
the
earth
they
dreaded
as
magical
the
delicate
images
engraved
on
old
greek
gems
they
dreaded
the
very
roman
cities
they
had
destroyed
they
were
the
work
of
enchanters
like
the
ruins
of
albans
here
in
england
they
were
all
full
of
devils
guarding
the
treasures
which
the
romans
had
hidden
the
caesars
became
to
them
magical
the
poet
virgil
became
the
prince
of
necromancers
if
the
secrets
of
nature
were
to
be
known
they
were
to
be
known
by
unlawful
means
by
prying
into
the
mysteries
of
the
old
heathen
magicians
or
of
the
mohammedan
doctors
of
cordova
and
seville
and
those
who
dared
to
do
so
were
respected
and
feared
and
often
came
to
evil
ends
it
needed
moral
courage
then
to
face
and
interpret
fact
such
brave
men
as
pope
gerbert
roger
bacon
galileo
even
kepler
did
not
lead
happy
lives
some
of
them
found
themselves
in
prison
all
the
medieval
sages
even
albertus
stigmatised
as
magicians
one
wonders
that
more
of
them
did
not
imitate
poor
paracelsus
who
unable
to
get
a
hearing
for
his
coarse
common
sense
took
vain
and
sensual
to
drinking
the
laudanum
which
he
himself
had
discovered
and
vaunted
as
a
priceless
boon
to
men
and
died
as
the
fool
dieth
in
spite
of
all
his
wisdom
for
the
romani
nominis
umbra
the
shadow
of
the
mighty
race
whom
they
had
conquered
lay
heavy
on
our
forefathers
for
centuries
and
their
dread
of
the
great
heathens
was
really
a
dread
of
nature
and
of
the
powers
thereof
for
when
the
authority
of
great
names
has
reigned
unquestioned
for
many
centuries
those
names
become
to
the
human
mind
integral
and
necessary
parts
of
nature
itself
they
are
as
it
were
absorbed
into
it
they
become
its
laws
its
canons
its
demiurges
and
guardian
spirits
their
words
become
regarded
as
actual
facts
in
one
word
they
become
a
superstition
and
are
feared
as
parts
of
the
vast
unknown
and
to
deny
what
they
have
said
is
in
the
minds
of
the
many
not
merely
to
fly
in
the
face
of
reverent
wisdom
but
to
fly
in
the
face
of
facts
during
a
great
part
of
the
middle
ages
for
instance
it
was
impossible
for
an
educated
man
to
think
of
nature
itself
without
thinking
first
of
what
aristotle
had
said
of
her
aristotle
dicta
were
nature
and
when
benedetti
at
venice
opposed
in
aristotle
opinions
on
violent
and
natural
motion
there
were
hundreds
perhaps
in
the
universities
of
europe
as
there
certainly
were
in
the
days
of
the
immortal
epistolae
obscurorum
virorum
who
were
ready
in
spite
of
all
benedetti
professed
reverence
for
aristotle
to
accuse
him
of
outraging
not
only
the
father
of
philosophy
but
nature
itself
and
its
palpable
and
notorious
facts
for
the
restoration
of
letters
in
the
fifteenth
century
had
not
at
first
mended
matters
so
strong
was
the
dread
of
nature
in
the
minds
of
the
masses
the
minds
of
men
had
sported
forth
not
toward
any
sound
investigation
of
facts
but
toward
an
eclectic
resuscitation
of
neoplatonism
which
endured
not
without
a
certain
beauty
and
use
as
let
spenser
faerie
queen
bear
witness
till
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
after
that
time
a
rapid
change
began
it
is
marked
by
it
has
been
notably
assisted
by
the
foundation
of
our
own
royal
society
its
causes
i
will
not
enter
into
they
are
so
inextricably
mixed
i
hold
with
theological
questions
that
they
can
not
be
discussed
here
i
will
only
point
out
to
you
these
facts
that
from
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
noblest
heads
and
the
noblest
hearts
of
europe
concentrated
themselves
more
and
more
on
the
brave
and
patient
investigation
of
physical
facts
as
the
source
of
priceless
future
blessings
to
mankind
that
the
eighteenth
century
which
it
has
been
the
fashion
of
late
to
depreciate
did
more
for
the
welfare
of
mankind
in
every
conceivable
direction
than
the
whole
fifteen
centuries
before
it
that
it
did
this
good
work
by
boldly
observing
and
analysing
facts
that
this
boldness
towards
facts
increased
in
proportion
as
europe
became
indoctrinated
with
the
jewish
literature
and
that
notably
such
men
as
kepler
newton
berkeley
spinoza
leibnitz
descartes
in
whatsoever
else
they
differed
agreed
in
this
that
their
attitude
towards
nature
was
derived
from
the
teaching
of
the
jewish
sages
i
believe
that
we
are
not
yet
fully
aware
how
much
we
owe
to
the
jewish
mind
in
the
gradual
emancipation
of
the
human
intellect
the
connection
may
not
of
course
be
one
of
cause
and
effect
it
may
be
a
mere
coincidence
i
believe
it
to
be
a
cause
one
of
course
of
very
many
causes
but
still
an
integral
cause
at
least
the
coincidence
is
too
remarkable
a
fact
not
to
be
worthy
of
investigation
i
said
just
now
the
emancipation
of
the
human
intellect
i
did
not
say
of
science
or
of
the
scientific
intellect
and
for
this
reason
that
the
emancipation
of
science
is
the
emancipation
of
the
common
mind
of
all
men
all
men
can
partake
of
the
gains
of
free
scientific
thought
not
merely
by
enjoying
its
physical
results
but
by
becoming
more
scientific
men
themselves
therefore
it
was
that
though
i
began
my
first
lecture
by
defining
superstition
i
did
not
begin
my
second
by
defining
its
antagonist
science
for
the
word
science
defines
itself
it
means
simply
knowledge
that
is
of
course
right
knowledge
or
such
an
approximation
as
can
be
obtained
knowledge
of
any
natural
object
its
classification
its
causes
its
effects
or
in
plain
english
what
it
is
how
it
came
where
it
is
and
what
can
be
done
with
it
and
scientific
method
likewise
needs
no
definition
for
it
is
simply
the
exercise
of
common
sense
it
is
not
a
peculiar
unique
professional
or
mysterious
process
of
the
understanding
but
the
same
which
all
men
employ
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
in
forming
correct
conclusions
every
one
who
knows
the
philosophic
writings
of
john
stuart
mill
will
be
familiar
with
this
opinion
but
to
those
who
have
no
leisure
to
study
him
i
should
recommend
the
reading
of
professor
huxley
third
lecture
on
the
origin
of
species
in
that
he
shows
with
great
logical
skill
as
well
as
with
some
humour
how
the
man
who
on
rising
in
the
morning
finds
the
window
open
the
spoons
and
teapot
gone
the
mark
of
a
dirty
hand
on
the
and
that
of
a
boot
outside
and
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
someone
has
broken
open
the
window
and
stolen
the
plate
arrives
at
that
hypothesis
for
it
is
nothing
more
by
a
long
and
complex
train
of
inductions
and
deductions
of
just
the
same
kind
as
those
which
according
to
the
baconian
philosophy
are
to
be
used
for
investigating
the
deepest
secrets
of
nature
this
is
true
even
of
those
sciences
which
involve
long
mathematical
calculations
in
fact
the
stating
of
the
problem
to
be
solved
is
the
most
important
element
in
the
calculation
and
that
is
so
thoroughly
a
labour
of
common
sense
that
an
utterly
uneducated
mart
may
and
often
does
state
an
abstruse
problem
clearly
and
correctly
seeing
what
ought
to
be
proved
and
perhaps
how
to
prove
it
though
he
may
be
unable
to
work
the
problem
out
for
want
of
mathematical
knowledge
but
that
mathematical
knowledge
is
not
as
all
cambridge
men
are
surely
aware
the
result
of
any
special
gift
it
is
merely
the
development
of
those
conceptions
of
form
and
number
which
every
human
being
possesses
and
any
person
of
average
intellect
can
make
himself
a
fair
mathematician
if
he
will
only
pay
continuous
attention
in
plain
english
think
enough
about
the
subject
there
are
sciences
again
which
do
not
involve
mathematical
calculation
for
instance
botany
zoology
geology
which
are
just
now
passing
from
their
old
stage
of
classificatory
sciences
into
the
rank
of
organic
ones
these
are
without
doubt
altogether
within
the
scope
of
the
merest
common
sense
any
man
or
woman
of
average
intellect
if
they
will
but
observe
and
think
for
themselves
freely
boldly
patiently
accurately
may
judge
for
themselves
of
the
conclusions
of
these
sciences
may
add
to
these
conclusions
fresh
and
important
discoveries
and
if
i
am
asked
for
a
proof
of
what
i
assert
i
point
to
rain
and
rivers
written
by
no
professed
scientific
man
but
by
a
colonel
in
the
guards
known
to
fame
only
as
one
of
the
most
perfect
horsemen
in
the
world
let
me
illustrate
my
meaning
by
an
example
a
man
i
do
not
say
a
geologist
but
simply
a
man
squire
or
ploughman
sees
a
small
valley
say
one
of
the
which
open
into
the
larger
valleys
in
the
windsor
forest
district
he
wishes
to
ascertain
its
age
he
has
at
first
sight
a
very
simple
measure
that
of
denudation
he
sees
that
the
glen
is
now
being
eaten
out
by
a
little
stream
the
product
of
innumerable
springs
which
arise
along
its
sides
and
which
are
fed
entirely
by
the
rain
on
the
moors
above
he
finds
on
observation
that
this
stream
brings
down
some
ten
cubic
yards
of
sand
and
gravel
on
an
average
every
year
the
actual
quantity
of
earth
which
has
been
removed
to
make
the
glen
may
be
several
million
cubic
yards
here
is
an
easy
sum
in
arithmetic
at
the
rate
of
ten
cubic
yards
the
stream
has
taken
several
hundred
thousand
years
to
make
the
glen
you
will
observe
that
this
result
is
obtained
by
mere
common
sense
he
has
a
right
to
assume
that
the
stream
originally
began
the
glen
because
he
finds
it
in
the
act
of
enlarging
it
just
as
much
right
as
he
has
to
assume
if
he
find
a
hole
in
his
pocket
and
his
last
coin
in
the
act
of
falling
through
it
that
the
rest
of
his
money
has
fallen
through
the
same
hole
it
is
a
sufficient
cause
and
the
simplest
a
number
of
observations
as
to
the
present
rate
of
denudation
and
a
sum
which
any
railroad
contractor
can
do
in
his
head
to
determine
the
solid
contents
of
the
valley
are
all
that
are
needed
the
method
is
that
of
science
but
it
is
also
that
of
simple
common
sense
you
will
remember
therefore
that
this
is
no
mere
theory
or
hypothesis
but
a
pretty
fair
and
simple
conclusion
from
palpable
facts
that
the
probability
lies
with
the
belief
that
the
glen
is
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
old
that
it
is
not
the
observer
business
to
prove
it
further
but
other
persons
to
disprove
it
if
they
can
but
does
the
matter
end
here
no
and
for
certain
reasons
it
is
good
that
it
should
not
end
here
the
observer
if
he
be
a
cautious
man
begins
to
see
if
he
can
disprove
his
own
conclusions
moreover
being
human
he
is
probably
somewhat
awed
if
not
appalled
by
his
own
conclusion
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
spent
in
making
that
little
glen
common
sense
would
say
that
the
longer
it
took
to
make
the
less
wonder
there
was
in
its
being
made
at
last
but
the
instinctive
human
feeling
is
the
opposite
there
is
in
men
and
there
remains
in
them
even
after
they
are
civilised
and
all
other
forms
of
the
dread
of
nature
have
died
out
in
them
a
dread
of
size
of
vast
space
of
vast
time
that
latter
mind
being
always
imagined
as
space
as
we
confess
when
we
speak
instinctively
of
a
space
of
time
they
will
not
understand
that
size
is
merely
a
relative
not
an
absolute
term
that
if
we
were
a
thousand
times
larger
than
we
are
the
universe
would
be
a
thousand
times
smaller
than
it
is
that
if
we
could
think
a
thousand
times
faster
than
we
do
time
would
be
a
thousand
times
longer
than
it
is
that
there
is
one
in
whom
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
to
whom
one
day
is
as
a
thousand
years
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
day
i
believe
this
dread
of
size
to
be
merely
like
all
other
superstitions
a
result
of
bodily
fear
a
development
of
the
instinct
which
makes
a
little
dog
run
away
from
a
big
dog
be
that
as
it
may
every
observer
has
it
and
so
the
man
conclusion
seems
to
him
strange
doubtful
he
will
reconsider
it
moreover
if
he
be
an
experienced
man
he
is
well
aware
that
first
guesses
first
hypotheses
are
not
always
the
right
ones
and
if
he
be
a
modest
man
he
will
consider
the
fact
that
many
thousands
of
thoughtful
men
in
all
ages
and
many
thousands
still
would
say
that
the
glen
can
only
be
a
few
thousand
or
possibly
a
few
hundred
years
old
and
he
will
feel
bound
to
consider
their
opinion
as
far
as
it
is
like
his
own
drawn
from
facts
but
no
further
so
he
casts
about
for
all
other
methods
by
which
the
glen
may
have
been
produced
to
see
if
any
one
of
them
will
account
for
it
in
a
shorter
time
was
it
made
by
an
earthquake
no
for
the
strata
on
both
sides
are
identical
at
the
same
level
and
in
the
same
plane
or
by
a
mighty
current
if
so
the
flood
must
have
run
in
at
the
upper
end
before
it
ran
out
at
the
lower
but
nothing
has
run
in
at
the
upper
end
all
round
above
are
the
undisturbed
beds
of
the
horizontal
moor
without
channel
or
depression
or
by
water
draining
off
a
vast
flat
as
it
was
upheaved
out
of
the
sea
that
is
a
likely
guess
the
valley
at
its
upper
end
spreads
out
like
the
fingers
of
a
hand
as
the
gullies
in
do
but
that
hypothesis
will
not
stand
there
is
no
vast
unbroken
flat
behind
the
glen
right
and
left
of
it
are
other
similar
glens
parted
from
it
by
long
narrow
ridges
these
also
must
be
explained
on
the
same
hypothesis
but
they
can
not
for
there
could
not
have
been
to
make
them
all
or
a
tenth
of
them
there
are
no
other
possible
hypotheses
and
so
he
must
fall
back
on
the
original
theory
the
rain
the
springs
the
brook
they
have
done
it
all
even
as
they
are
doing
it
this
day
but
is
not
that
still
a
hasty
assumption
may
not
their
denuding
power
have
been
far
greater
in
old
times
than
now
why
should
it
because
there
was
more
rain
then
than
now
that
he
must
put
out
of
court
there
is
no
evidence
of
it
whatsoever
because
the
land
was
more
friable
originally
well
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
that
the
experience
of
every
countryman
tells
him
that
bare
or
fallow
land
is
more
easily
washed
away
than
land
under
vegetation
and
no
doubt
when
these
gravels
and
sands
rose
from
the
sea
they
were
barren
for
hundreds
of
years
he
has
some
measure
of
the
time
required
because
he
can
tell
roughly
how
long
it
takes
for
sands
and
shingles
left
by
the
sea
to
become
covered
with
vegetation
but
he
must
allow
that
the
friability
of
the
land
must
have
been
originally
much
greater
than
now
for
hundreds
of
years
but
again
does
that
fact
really
cut
off
any
great
space
of
time
from
his
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
for
when
the
land
first
rose
from
the
sea
that
glen
was
not
there
some
slight
bay
or
bend
in
the
shore
determined
its
site
that
stream
was
not
there
it
was
split
up
into
a
million
little
springs
oozing
side
by
side
from
the
shore
and
having
each
a
very
minute
denuding
power
which
kept
continually
increasing
by
combination
as
the
glen
ate
its
way
inwards
and
the
rainfall
drained
by
all
these
little
springs
was
collected
into
the
one
central
stream
so
that
when
the
ground
being
bare
was
most
liable
to
be
denuded
the
water
was
least
able
to
do
it
and
as
the
denuding
power
of
the
water
increased
the
land
being
covered
with
vegetation
became
more
and
more
able
to
resist
it
all
this
he
has
seen
going
on
at
the
present
day
in
the
similar
gullies
worn
in
the
soft
strata
of
the
south
hampshire
coast
especially
round
bournemouth
so
the
two
disturbing
elements
in
the
calculation
may
be
fairly
set
off
against
each
other
as
making
a
difference
of
only
a
few
thousands
or
tens
of
thousands
of
years
either
way
and
the
age
of
the
glen
may
fairly
be
if
not
a
million
years
yet
such
a
length
of
years
as
mankind
still
speak
of
with
bated
breath
as
if
forsooth
it
would
do
them
some
harm
i
trust
that
every
scientific
man
in
this
room
will
agree
with
me
that
the
imaginary
squire
or
ploughman
would
have
been
conducting
his
investigation
strictly
according
to
the
laws
of
the
baconian
philosophy
you
will
remark
meanwhile
that
he
has
not
used
a
single
scientific
term
or
referred
to
a
single
scientific
investigation
and
has
observed
nothing
and
thought
nothing
which
might
not
have
been
observed
and
thought
by
any
one
who
chose
to
use
his
common
sense
and
not
to
be
afraid
but
because
he
has
come
round
after
all
this
further
investigation
to
something
very
like
his
first
conclusion
was
all
that
further
investigation
useless
no
a
thousand
times
no
it
is
this
very
verification
of
hypotheses
which
makes
the
sound
ones
safe
and
destroys
the
unsound
it
is
this
struggle
with
all
sorts
of
superstitions
which
makes
science
strong
and
sure
and
her
march
irresistible
winning
ground
slowly
but
never
receding
from
it
it
is
this
buffeting
of
adversity
which
compels
her
not
to
rest
dangerously
upon
the
shallow
sand
of
first
guesses
and
single
observations
but
to
strike
her
roots
down
deep
wide
and
interlaced
into
the
solid
ground
of
actual
facts
it
is
very
necessary
to
insist
on
this
point
for
there
have
been
men
in
all
past
ages
i
do
not
say
whether
there
are
any
such
now
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
will
be
hereafter
men
who
have
tried
to
represent
scientific
method
as
something
difficult
mysterious
peculiar
unique
not
to
be
attained
by
the
unscientific
mass
and
this
not
for
the
purpose
of
exalting
science
but
rather
of
discrediting
her
for
as
long
as
the
masses
educated
or
uneducated
are
ignorant
of
what
scientific
method
is
they
will
look
on
scientific
men
as
the
middle
age
looked
on
necromancers
as
a
privileged
but
awful
and
uncanny
caste
possessed
of
mighty
secrets
who
may
do
them
great
good
but
may
also
do
them
great
harm
which
belief
on
the
part
of
the
masses
will
enable
these
persons
to
instal
themselves
as
the
critics
of
science
though
not
scientific
men
themselves
and
as
shakespeare
has
it
to
talk
of
robin
hood
though
they
never
shot
in
his
bow
thus
they
become
mediators
to
the
masses
between
the
scientific
and
the
unscientific
worlds
they
tell
them
you
are
not
to
trust
the
conclusions
of
men
of
science
at
first
hand
you
are
not
fit
judges
of
their
facts
or
of
their
methods
it
is
we
who
will
by
a
cautious
eclecticism
choose
out
for
you
such
of
their
conclusions
as
are
safe
for
you
and
them
we
will
advise
you
to
believe
to
the
scientific
man
on
the
other
hand
as
often
as
anything
is
discovered
unpleasing
to
them
they
will
say
imperiously
and
e
cathedra
your
new
theory
contradicts
the
established
facts
of
science
for
they
will
know
well
that
whatever
the
men
of
science
think
of
their
assertion
the
masses
will
believe
it
totally
unaware
that
the
speakers
are
by
their
very
terms
showing
their
ignorance
of
science
and
that
what
they
call
established
facts
scientific
men
call
merely
provisional
conclusions
which
they
would
throw
away
without
a
pang
were
the
known
facts
explained
better
by
a
fresh
theory
or
did
fresh
facts
require
one
this
has
happened
too
often
it
is
in
the
interest
of
superstition
that
it
should
happen
again
and
the
best
way
to
prevent
it
surely
is
to
tell
the
masses
scientific
method
is
no
peculiar
mystery
requiring
a
peculiar
initiation
it
is
simply
common
sense
combined
with
uncommon
courage
which
includes
uncommon
honesty
and
uncommon
patience
and
if
you
will
be
brave
honest
patient
and
rational
you
will
need
no
mystagogues
to
tell
you
what
in
science
to
believe
and
what
not
to
believe
for
you
will
be
just
as
good
judges
of
scientific
facts
and
theories
as
those
who
assume
the
right
of
guiding
your
convictions
you
are
men
and
women
and
more
than
that
you
need
not
be
and
let
me
say
that
the
man
of
our
days
whose
writings
exemplify
most
thoroughly
what
i
am
going
to
say
is
the
justly
revered
thomas
carlyle
as
far
as
i
know
he
has
never
written
on
any
scientific
subject
for
aught
i
am
aware
of
he
may
know
nothing
of
mathematics
or
chemistry
of
comparative
anatomy
or
geology
for
aught
i
am
aware
of
he
may
know
a
great
deal
about
them
all
and
like
a
wise
man
hold
his
tongue
and
give
the
world
merely
the
results
in
the
form
of
general
thought
but
this
i
know
that
his
writings
are
instinct
with
the
very
spirit
of
science
that
he
has
taught
men
more
than
any
living
man
the
meaning
and
end
of
science
that
he
has
taught
men
moral
and
intellectual
courage
to
face
facts
boldly
while
they
confess
the
divineness
of
facts
not
to
be
afraid
of
nature
and
not
to
worship
nature
to
believe
that
man
can
know
truth
and
that
only
in
as
far
as
he
knows
truth
can
he
live
worthily
on
this
earth
and
thus
he
has
vindicated
as
no
other
man
in
our
days
has
done
at
once
the
dignity
of
nature
and
the
dignity
of
spirit
that
he
would
have
made
a
distinguished
scientific
man
we
may
be
as
certain
from
his
writings
as
we
may
be
certain
when
we
see
a
fine
old
horse
of
a
certain
stamp
that
he
would
have
made
a
hunter
though
he
has
been
unfortunately
all
his
life
in
harness
therefore
did
i
try
to
train
a
young
man
of
science
to
be
true
devout
and
earnest
accurate
and
daring
i
should
say
read
what
you
will
but
at
least
read
carlyle
it
is
a
small
matter
to
me
and
i
doubt
not
to
him
whether
you
will
agree
with
his
special
conclusions
but
his
premises
and
his
method
are
irrefragable
for
they
stand
on
the
voluntatem
dei
in
rebus
revelatam
on
fact
and
common
sense
and
carlyle
writings
if
i
am
correct
in
my
estimate
of
them
will
afford
a
very
sufficient
answer
to
those
who
think
that
the
scientific
habit
of
mind
tends
to
irreverence
doubtless
this
accusation
will
always
be
brought
against
science
by
those
who
confound
reverence
with
fear
for
from
blind
fear
of
the
unknown
science
does
certainly
deliver
man
she
does
by
man
as
he
does
by
an
unbroken
colt
the
colt
sees
by
the
road
side
some
quite
new
object
a
boot
an
old
kettle
or
what
not
what
a
fearful
monster
what
unknown
terrific
powers
may
it
not
possess
and
the
colt
shies
across
the
road
runs
up
the
bank
rears
on
end
putting
itself
thereby
as
many
a
man
does
in
real
danger
what
cure
is
there
but
one
experience
so
science
takes
us
as
we
should
take
the
colt
gently
by
the
halter
and
makes
us
simply
smell
at
the
new
monster
till
after
a
few
trembling
sniffs
we
discover
like
the
colt
that
it
is
not
a
monster
but
a
kettle
yet
i
think
if
we
sum
up
the
loss
and
gain
we
shall
find
the
colt
character
has
gained
rather
than
lost
by
being
thus
disabused
he
learns
to
substitute
a
very
rational
reverence
for
the
man
who
is
breaking
him
in
for
a
totally
irrational
reverence
for
the
kettle
and
becomes
thereby
a
much
wiser
and
more
useful
member
of
society
as
does
the
man
when
disabused
of
his
superstitions
from
which
follows
one
result
that
if
science
proposes
as
she
does
to
make
men
brave
wise
and
independent
she
must
needs
excite
unpleasant
feelings
in
all
who
desire
to
keep
men
cowardly
ignorant
and
slavish
and
that
too
many
such
persons
have
existed
in
all
ages
is
but
too
notorious
there
have
been
from
all
time
goetai
quacks
powwow
men
and
necromancers
of
various
sorts
who
having
for
their
own
purposes
set
forth
partial
grounded
fantastic
and
frightful
interpretations
of
nature
have
no
love
for
those
who
search
after
a
true
exact
brave
and
hopeful
one
and
therefore
it
is
to
be
feared
or
hoped
that
science
and
superstition
will
to
the
world
end
remain
irreconcilable
and
internecine
foes
conceive
the
feelings
of
an
old
lapland
witch
who
has
had
for
the
last
fifty
years
all
the
winds
in
a
sealskin
bag
and
has
been
selling
fair
breezes
to
northern
skippers
at
so
much
a
puff
asserting
her
powers
so
often
poor
old
soul
that
she
has
got
to
half
believe
them
herself
conceive
i
say
her
feelings
at
seeing
her
customers
watch
the
admiralty
and
con
the
weather
reports
in
the
times
conceive
the
feelings
of
sir
samuel
african
friend
katchiba
the
chief
who
possessed
a
whole
houseful
of
thunder
and
lightning
though
he
did
not
he
confessed
keep
it
in
a
bottle
as
they
do
in
england
if
sir
samuel
had
had
the
means
and
the
will
of
giving
to
katchiba
negros
a
course
of
lectures
on
electricity
with
appropriate
experiments
and
a
real
bottle
full
of
real
lightning
among
the
foremost
it
is
clear
that
only
two
methods
of
would
have
been
open
to
the
namely
either
to
kill
sir
samuel
or
to
buy
his
real
secret
of
bottling
the
lightning
that
he
might
use
it
for
his
own
ends
the
former
method
that
of
killing
the
man
of
science
was
found
more
easy
in
ancient
times
the
latter
in
these
modern
ones
and
there
have
been
always
those
who
too
to
kill
the
scientific
man
have
patronised
knowledge
not
for
its
own
sake
but
for
the
use
which
may
be
made
of
it
who
would
like
to
keep
a
tame
man
of
science
as
they
would
a
tame
poet
or
a
tame
parrot
who
say
let
us
have
science
by
all
means
but
not
too
much
of
it
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
be
doled
out
to
the
world
like
medicine
in
small
and
cautious
doses
you
the
scientific
man
will
of
course
freely
discover
what
you
choose
only
do
not
talk
too
loudly
about
it
leave
that
to
us
we
understand
the
world
and
are
meant
to
guide
and
govern
it
so
discover
freely
and
meanwhile
hand
over
your
discoveries
to
us
that
we
may
instruct
and
edify
the
populace
with
so
much
of
them
as
we
think
safe
while
we
keep
our
position
thereby
and
in
many
cases
make
much
money
by
your
science
do
that
and
we
will
patronise
you
applaud
you
ask
you
to
our
houses
and
you
shall
be
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
linen
and
fare
sumptuously
with
us
every
day
i
know
not
whether
these
latter
are
not
the
worst
enemies
which
science
has
they
are
often
such
excellent
respectable
orderly
persons
they
desire
so
sincerely
that
everyone
should
be
wise
only
not
too
wise
they
are
so
utterly
unaware
of
the
mischief
they
are
doing
they
would
recoil
with
horror
if
they
were
told
they
were
so
many
iscariots
betraying
truth
with
a
kiss
but
science
as
yet
has
withstood
both
terrors
and
blandishments
in
old
times
she
endured
being
imprisoned
and
slain
she
came
to
life
again
perhaps
it
was
the
will
of
him
in
whom
all
things
live
that
she
should
live
perhaps
it
was
his
spirit
which
gave
her
life
she
can
endure
too
being
starved
her
votaries
have
not
as
yet
cared
much
for
purple
and
fine
linen
and
sumptuous
fare
there
are
a
very
few
among
them
who
joining
brilliant
talents
to
solid
learning
have
risen
to
deserved
popularity
to
titles
and
to
wealth
but
even
their
labours
it
seems
to
me
are
never
rewarded
in
any
proportion
to
the
time
and
the
intellect
spent
on
them
nor
to
the
benefits
which
they
bring
to
mankind
while
the
great
majority
unpaid
and
unknown
toil
on
and
have
to
find
in
science
her
own
reward
better
perhaps
that
it
should
be
so
better
for
science
that
she
should
be
free
in
holy
poverty
to
go
where
she
will
and
say
what
she
knows
than
that
she
should
be
hired
out
at
so
much
a
year
to
say
things
pleasing
to
the
many
and
to
those
who
guide
the
many
and
so
i
verily
believe
the
majority
of
scientific
men
think
there
are
those
among
them
who
have
obeyed
very
faithfully
paul
precept
no
man
that
warreth
entangleth
himself
with
the
affairs
of
this
life
for
they
have
discovered
that
they
are
engaged
in
a
war
a
veritable
war
against
the
rulers
of
darkness
against
ignorance
and
its
twin
children
fear
and
cruelty
of
that
war
they
see
neither
the
end
nor
even
the
plan
but
they
are
ready
to
go
on
ready
with
socrates
to
follow
reason
whithersoever
it
leads
and
content
meanwhile
like
good
soldiers
in
a
campaign
if
they
can
keep
tolerably
in
a
line
and
use
their
weapons
and
see
a
few
yards
ahead
of
them
through
the
smoke
and
the
woods
they
will
come
out
somewhere
at
last
they
know
not
where
nor
when
but
they
will
come
out
at
last
into
the
daylight
and
the
open
field
and
be
told
then
perhaps
to
their
own
astonishment
as
many
a
gallant
soldier
has
been
told
that
by
simply
walking
straight
on
and
doing
the
duty
which
lay
nearest
them
they
have
helped
to
win
a
great
battle
and
slay
great
giants
earning
the
thanks
of
their
country
and
of
mankind
and
meanwhile
if
they
get
their
shilling
of
they
are
content
i
had
almost
said
they
ought
to
be
content
for
science
is
i
verily
believe
like
virtue
its
own
exceeding
great
reward
i
can
conceive
few
human
states
more
enviable
than
that
of
the
man
to
whom
panting
in
the
foul
laboratory
or
watching
for
his
life
under
the
tropic
forest
isis
shall
for
a
moment
lift
her
sacred
veil
and
show
him
once
and
for
ever
the
thing
he
dreamed
not
of
some
law
or
even
mere
hint
of
a
law
explaining
one
fact
but
explaining
with
it
a
thousand
more
connecting
them
all
with
each
other
and
with
the
mighty
whole
till
order
and
meaning
shoots
through
some
old
chaos
of
scattered
observations
is
not
that
a
joy
a
prize
which
wealth
can
not
give
nor
poverty
take
away
what
it
may
lead
to
he
knows
not
of
what
use
it
may
become
he
knows
not
but
this
he
knows
that
somewhere
it
must
lead
of
some
use
it
will
be
for
it
is
a
truth
and
having
found
a
truth
he
has
exorcised
one
more
of
the
ghosts
which
haunt
humanity
he
has
left
one
object
less
for
man
to
fear
one
object
more
for
man
to
use
yes
the
scientific
man
may
have
this
comfort
that
whatever
he
has
done
he
has
done
good
that
he
is
following
a
mistress
who
has
never
yet
conferred
aught
but
benefits
on
the
human
race
what
physical
science
may
do
hereafter
i
know
not
but
as
yet
she
has
done
this
she
has
enormously
increased
the
wealth
of
the
human
race
and
has
therefore
given
employment
food
existence
to
millions
who
without
science
would
either
have
starved
or
have
never
been
born
she
has
shown
that
the
dictum
of
the
early
political
economists
that
population
has
a
tendency
to
increase
faster
than
the
means
of
subsistence
is
no
law
of
humanity
but
merely
a
tendency
of
the
barbaric
and
ignorant
man
which
can
be
counteracted
by
increasing
manifold
by
scientific
means
his
powers
of
producing
food
she
has
taught
men
during
the
last
few
years
to
foresee
and
elude
the
most
destructive
storms
and
there
is
no
reason
for
doubting
and
many
reasons
for
hoping
that
she
will
gradually
teach
men
to
elude
other
terrific
forces
of
nature
too
powerful
and
too
seemingly
capricious
for
them
to
conquer
she
has
discovered
innumerable
remedies
and
alleviations
for
pains
and
disease
she
has
thrown
such
light
on
the
causes
of
epidemics
that
we
are
able
to
say
now
that
the
presence
of
cholera
and
probably
of
all
zymotic
diseases
in
any
place
is
usually
a
sin
and
a
shame
for
which
the
owners
and
authorities
of
that
place
ought
to
be
punishable
by
law
as
destroyers
of
their
while
for
the
weak
for
those
who
in
the
barbarous
and
state
and
out
of
that
last
we
are
only
just
emerging
how
much
has
she
done
an
earnest
of
much
more
which
she
will
do
she
has
delivered
the
insane
i
may
say
by
the
scientific
insight
of
one
man
more
worthy
of
titles
and
pensions
than
of
those
who
earn
them
i
mean
the
great
and
good
pinel
from
hopeless
misery
and
torture
into
comparative
peace
and
comfort
and
at
least
the
possibility
of
cure
for
children
she
has
done
much
or
rather
might
do
would
parents
read
and
perpend
such
books
as
andrew
combe
and
those
of
other
writers
on
physical
education
we
should
not
then
see
the
children
even
of
the
rich
done
to
death
piecemeal
by
improper
food
improper
clothes
neglect
of
ventilation
and
the
commonest
measures
for
preserving
health
we
should
not
see
their
intellects
stunted
by
procrustean
attempts
to
teach
them
all
the
same
accomplishments
to
the
neglect
most
often
of
any
sound
practical
training
of
their
faculties
we
should
not
see
slight
indigestion
or
temporary
rushes
of
blood
to
the
head
condemned
and
punished
as
sins
against
him
who
took
up
little
children
in
his
arms
and
blessed
them
but
we
may
have
hope
when
we
compare
education
now
with
what
it
was
even
forty
years
ago
much
more
with
the
stupid
brutality
of
the
monastic
system
we
may
hail
for
children
as
well
as
for
grown
people
the
advent
of
the
reign
of
common
sense
and
for
woman
what
might
i
not
say
on
that
point
but
most
of
it
would
be
fitly
discussed
only
among
physicians
and
biologists
here
i
will
say
only
this
science
has
exterminated
at
least
among
civilised
nations
women
at
least
white
women
are
no
longer
tortured
or
burnt
alive
from
man
blind
fear
of
the
unknown
if
science
had
done
no
more
than
that
she
would
deserve
the
perpetual
thanks
and
the
perpetual
trust
not
only
of
the
women
whom
she
has
preserved
from
agony
but
the
men
whom
she
has
preserved
from
crime
these
benefits
have
already
accrued
to
civilised
men
because
they
have
lately
allowed
a
very
few
of
their
number
peaceably
to
imitate
rarey
and
find
out
what
nature
or
rather
to
speak
at
once
reverently
and
accurately
he
who
made
nature
is
thinking
of
and
obey
the
voluntatem
dei
in
rebus
revelatam
this
science
has
done
while
yet
in
her
infancy
what
she
will
do
in
her
maturity
who
dare
predict
at
least
in
the
face
of
such
facts
as
these
those
who
bid
us
fear
or
restrain
or
mutilate
science
bid
us
commit
an
act
of
folly
as
well
as
of
ingratitude
which
can
only
harm
ourselves
for
science
has
as
yet
done
nothing
but
good
will
any
one
tell
me
what
harm
it
has
ever
done
when
any
one
will
show
me
a
single
result
of
science
of
the
knowledge
of
and
use
of
physical
facts
which
has
not
tended
directly
to
the
benefit
of
mankind
moral
and
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
and
economic
then
i
shall
be
tempted
to
believe
that
solomon
was
wrong
when
he
said
that
the
one
thing
to
be
sought
after
on
earth
more
precious
than
all
treasure
she
who
has
length
of
days
in
her
right
hand
and
in
her
left
hand
riches
and
honour
whose
ways
are
ways
of
pleasantness
and
all
her
paths
are
peace
who
is
a
tree
of
life
to
all
who
lay
hold
on
her
and
makes
happy
every
one
who
retains
her
is
as
you
will
see
if
you
will
yourselves
consult
the
passage
that
very
wisdom
by
which
god
has
founded
the
earth
and
that
very
understanding
by
which
he
has
established
the
heavens
thoughts
in
a
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
may
of
course
think
of
anything
which
we
choose
in
a
as
we
may
anywhere
else
thought
is
free
at
least
so
we
fancy
but
the
most
right
sort
of
thought
after
all
is
thought
about
what
lies
nearest
us
not
always
but
surely
once
in
a
way
that
we
may
understand
something
of
everyday
objects
and
therefore
it
may
be
well
worth
our
while
to
go
once
into
a
and
think
about
it
till
we
have
learnt
what
a
is
learnt
what
a
is
everybody
knows
if
it
be
so
everybody
knows
more
than
i
know
we
all
know
a
when
we
see
one
but
we
do
not
all
know
what
we
see
i
do
not
know
i
know
a
little
a
few
scraps
of
fact
about
these
pits
round
here
though
about
no
others
were
i
to
go
into
a
pit
a
hundred
miles
even
fifty
miles
off
i
could
tell
you
nothing
certain
about
it
perhaps
might
make
a
dozen
mistakes
but
what
i
know
with
tolerable
certainty
about
the
pits
round
here
i
wish
to
tell
you
but
why
you
do
not
need
one
in
ten
of
you
to
know
anything
about
gravel
unless
you
be
highway
surveyor
or
have
a
to
make
and
then
someone
will
easily
tell
you
where
the
best
gravel
is
to
be
got
at
so
much
a
load
very
true
but
you
come
here
to
instruct
yourselves
that
is
to
learn
if
you
can
something
more
about
the
world
you
live
in
something
more
about
god
who
made
the
world
and
you
come
here
to
educate
yourselves
to
educe
and
bring
out
your
own
powers
of
perceiving
judging
reasoning
to
improve
yourselves
in
the
art
of
all
arts
which
is
the
art
of
learning
that
is
mental
education
now
if
a
will
teach
you
a
little
about
these
things
you
will
surely
call
it
a
rich
if
it
helps
you
to
wisdom
which
is
worth
more
than
gold
which
is
the
only
way
to
get
gold
wisely
and
spend
it
wisely
then
we
will
call
our
pit
no
more
a
but
a
a
mine
of
wisdom
let
us
go
out
then
in
fancy
for
it
is
too
cold
to
go
out
in
person
to
hook
common
scramble
down
into
the
first
we
come
to
and
see
what
we
can
see
the
first
thing
we
see
is
a
quantity
of
stones
more
or
less
rounded
lying
in
gravel
and
poor
clay
well
what
do
those
stones
tell
us
these
stones
as
i
told
you
when
i
addressed
you
last
are
ancient
and
venerable
worthies
they
have
seen
a
great
deal
in
their
time
they
have
had
a
great
deal
of
knocking
about
and
have
stood
it
manfully
they
have
stood
the
knocking
about
of
three
worlds
already
and
have
done
their
duty
therein
and
they
are
ready
if
you
choose
to
mend
the
road
with
them
to
stand
the
knocking
about
of
this
fourth
world
and
being
most
excellent
gravel
to
do
their
duty
in
this
world
likewise
which
is
more
i
fear
than
either
you
or
i
can
say
for
ourselves
three
worlds
yes
standing
there
in
the
i
see
three
old
worlds
in
each
of
which
these
stones
played
their
part
and
this
world
of
man
for
the
fourth
and
the
best
of
all
for
man
if
not
for
the
stones
i
speak
sober
truth
let
me
explain
it
step
by
step
you
know
the
to
the
south
and
the
sands
of
crooksbury
and
the
hind
head
beyond
them
there
is
one
world
you
know
the
clays
and
sands
of
hook
and
newnham
dogmersfield
and
shapley
heath
and
all
the
country
to
the
north
as
far
as
reading
there
is
a
second
world
you
know
the
itself
and
all
the
upper
soils
and
gravels
which
are
spread
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
country
to
the
north
there
is
a
third
world
let
us
take
them
one
by
one
first
the
chalk
the
rise
much
higher
than
the
surrounding
country
but
you
must
not
therefore
suppose
that
they
were
made
after
it
and
laid
on
the
top
of
it
that
guess
would
be
true
if
you
went
east
from
here
toward
the
hind
head
the
chalk
lies
on
the
top
of
the
sands
of
crooksbury
hill
and
the
clays
of
holt
forest
but
it
dips
underneath
the
sands
of
shapley
heath
and
the
clays
of
dogmersfield
and
reappears
from
underneath
them
again
at
reading
thus
you
at
odiham
stand
on
the
edge
of
a
chalk
basin
of
what
was
once
a
sea
or
estuary
with
shores
of
chalk
which
begins
at
the
foot
of
the
high
clere
hills
and
runs
eastward
widening
as
it
goes
past
london
into
the
eastern
sea
everywhere
under
this
great
basin
is
the
floor
of
chalk
covered
with
clays
and
sands
which
for
certain
reasons
are
called
by
geologists
tertiary
strata
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
a
this
first
that
all
the
flints
in
this
pit
have
come
out
of
the
chalk
they
are
coloured
most
of
them
with
iron
which
has
turned
them
brown
but
they
are
exactly
the
same
flints
as
those
gray
ones
in
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
how
do
i
know
that
i
think
our
own
eyes
will
prove
it
they
are
the
same
shapes
and
of
the
same
substance
but
as
a
still
surer
proof
we
find
exactly
the
same
fossils
in
them
sponges
choanites
which
were
something
like
our
modern
corals
and
shepherds
crowns
as
the
boys
call
the
fossil
the
species
of
all
these
and
of
other
fossils
in
the
and
in
the
are
absolutely
identical
the
natural
conclusion
is
then
that
the
gravel
has
been
formed
from
the
washings
of
the
chalk
the
white
lime
of
the
chalk
has
been
carried
away
in
water
by
some
flood
or
floods
the
heavier
flints
have
been
left
behind
stop
now
one
moment
and
think
you
all
know
how
very
few
flints
there
are
in
the
in
proportion
to
the
mass
of
chalk
you
all
know
what
vast
cover
the
country
to
the
north
and
often
to
the
thickness
of
many
feet
try
and
conceive
then
what
a
much
more
vast
mass
of
chalk
must
have
been
washed
away
to
leave
that
vast
mass
of
gravel
behind
conceive
it
is
past
conception
i
will
but
give
you
two
hints
as
to
its
probable
size
the
chalk
to
the
eastward
between
here
and
farnham
is
a
far
narrower
and
shallower
band
than
anywhere
else
in
england
its
narrowest
point
is
i
believe
beneath
the
bishop
palace
at
farnham
where
it
may
be
a
hundred
feet
thick
instead
of
several
hundred
as
it
usually
is
in
other
parts
of
england
the
cause
of
this
is
that
the
whole
of
the
upper
chalk
has
been
washed
away
to
form
the
to
the
north
and
east
of
us
again
some
of
you
may
have
been
on
the
hind
head
or
on
leith
hill
and
have
looked
southward
over
the
glorious
prospect
of
the
rich
weald
spread
out
five
hundred
feet
below
a
sight
to
make
an
englishman
proud
of
his
native
land
now
the
mass
of
chalk
which
has
been
carried
away
began
behind
you
at
the
hogsback
and
the
line
of
which
runs
to
boxhill
and
stretched
hundreds
of
feet
above
your
head
as
you
stand
on
hind
head
or
leith
hill
right
over
the
old
weald
of
sussex
to
the
chalk
of
the
south
downs
and
out
of
the
scourings
of
that
vast
mass
of
chalk
was
our
made
of
that
and
also
of
the
hind
head
sands
below
it
for
you
will
find
a
great
deal
of
sharp
sand
in
our
which
has
not
i
believe
come
from
the
grinding
of
chalk
flints
for
if
it
had
been
ground
it
would
not
be
the
sharp
sand
it
is
the
particles
would
be
rounded
off
at
the
edges
this
is
probably
sand
from
the
hind
head
from
what
geologists
term
the
greensands
below
the
chalk
and
i
have
a
better
proof
of
this
at
least
i
should
have
in
every
at
eversley
in
a
few
pieces
of
a
stone
which
is
not
at
all
flattish
and
oblong
not
more
than
two
or
three
inches
in
diameter
of
a
grayish
colour
and
a
porous
surface
which
no
ever
has
they
are
chert
which
abound
in
the
greensand
formation
and
insignificant
as
they
look
are
a
great
token
of
a
most
important
fact
that
the
currents
which
formed
our
sands
and
gravels
set
from
the
south
during
a
long
series
of
ages
first
till
they
had
washed
away
all
the
chalk
off
the
weald
and
next
till
they
had
washed
away
a
great
part
of
the
sands
which
then
became
exposed
the
remains
whereof
form
great
commons
over
a
wide
tract
of
surrey
now
let
me
pause
and
ask
you
to
observe
one
thing
how
in
inductive
science
we
arrive
by
patient
and
simple
observation
of
the
things
around
us
at
the
most
grand
and
surprising
results
of
course
i
am
not
giving
you
the
whole
of
the
facts
which
have
made
this
argument
certain
i
am
only
giving
you
enough
to
make
it
probable
to
you
its
certainty
has
been
proved
by
many
different
men
labouring
in
many
different
parts
of
england
and
of
the
continent
also
and
then
comparing
their
discoveries
together
often
of
course
making
mistakes
but
each
working
on
patiently
and
correcting
their
early
mistakes
by
fresh
facts
till
they
have
at
last
got
hold
of
the
true
key
to
the
mystery
and
are
as
certain
of
the
existence
of
the
great
island
of
the
weald
and
its
gradual
destruction
by
the
waves
and
currents
of
an
ancient
sea
as
if
they
had
seen
it
with
their
bodily
eyes
you
must
take
all
this
of
course
as
truth
from
me
but
you
may
go
and
examine
for
yourselves
and
see
how
far
your
own
common
sense
and
observations
agree
with
those
of
learned
geologists
the
history
of
this
great
wealden
island
to
the
of
us
is
obscure
enough
but
a
few
general
facts
which
bear
upon
our
pit
i
can
give
you
i
must
begin
however
ages
before
the
wealden
island
existed
when
the
chalk
of
which
its
mass
was
composed
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
ocean
we
know
now
what
chalk
is
and
how
it
was
made
we
know
that
it
was
deposited
as
white
lime
mud
at
a
vast
seemingly
undisturbed
by
winds
or
currents
we
know
that
not
only
the
flint
but
the
chalk
itself
is
made
up
of
shells
the
shell
of
little
microscopic
animalcules
smaller
than
a
needle
point
in
millions
of
millions
some
whole
some
broken
some
in
powder
which
lived
and
died
and
decayed
for
ages
in
the
great
chalk
sea
we
know
this
i
say
we
had
suspected
it
long
ago
and
become
more
and
more
certain
of
it
as
the
years
went
on
but
now
we
seem
to
have
a
proof
of
it
which
is
past
gainsaying
in
the
late
survey
of
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
ocean
with
a
view
to
laying
down
the
electric
telegraph
between
england
and
america
by
lieutenant
maury
of
the
american
navy
a
great
discovery
was
made
it
was
found
that
the
floor
of
the
atlantic
ocean
after
you
have
left
the
land
a
few
hundred
miles
is
one
vast
plain
of
mud
of
some
thirteen
hundred
miles
in
breadth
but
here
is
the
wonder
it
was
found
that
at
a
depth
averaging
fathoms
feet
in
utter
darkness
the
sea
floor
is
covered
with
countless
millions
of
of
the
same
families
though
not
of
the
same
species
as
those
which
compose
the
chalk
at
the
bottom
of
a
still
ocean
then
the
chalk
was
deposited
but
it
took
many
an
age
to
raise
it
to
where
odiham
now
stands
but
how
was
it
raised
by
the
upheaving
force
of
earthquakes
or
rather
by
the
upheaving
force
which
causes
earthquakes
when
it
acts
in
a
single
shock
cracking
the
earth
crust
by
an
explosion
but
which
acts
too
slowly
and
quietly
uplifting
day
by
day
and
year
by
year
some
portions
of
the
earth
surface
and
letting
others
sink
down
as
in
the
case
of
the
valley
of
the
jordan
and
the
dead
sea
which
is
now
feet
below
the
level
of
the
mediterranean
that
these
upheaving
forces
were
much
more
violent
than
now
in
the
earlier
epochs
of
our
planet
we
have
some
reason
to
believe
but
the
subject
is
too
long
a
one
to
enter
on
now
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
must
conceive
for
yourself
the
chalk
gradually
brought
up
to
the
surface
worn
away
along
a
shifting
shoreline
by
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
covered
in
shallow
water
by
the
clays
and
sands
on
which
odiham
stands
and
which
compose
the
earliest
part
of
our
second
world
a
second
world
a
new
world
we
can
use
no
weaker
expression
when
we
compare
the
chalk
with
the
strata
which
lie
upon
it
we
can
only
call
them
a
complete
new
creation
for
not
only
were
they
deposited
in
shallow
water
a
great
deal
of
them
probably
near
and
by
the
force
of
violent
currents
as
the
irregularity
of
their
lower
bed
proves
but
there
is
hardly
a
plant
or
animal
found
in
the
chalk
itself
which
is
found
in
the
gravels
sands
or
clays
above
it
the
shells
are
all
new
species
unseen
before
in
this
planet
the
vegetables
as
far
as
we
know
them
are
all
different
from
anything
found
in
the
chalk
or
in
the
beds
below
it
god
almighty
for
his
own
good
pleasure
has
made
all
things
new
it
is
a
very
awful
fact
but
it
is
a
very
certain
one
several
times
in
the
history
of
our
planet
has
the
lord
god
fulfilled
the
words
of
the
psalmist
thou
takest
away
their
breath
they
die
and
return
again
to
their
dust
thou
sendest
forth
thy
breath
they
are
made
and
thou
renewest
the
face
of
the
earth
but
in
no
instance
perhaps
is
the
gulf
so
vast
is
the
leap
from
one
world
to
another
so
sheer
as
that
between
the
chalk
and
the
london
clay
above
it
but
how
do
i
know
that
there
was
a
here
and
how
do
i
know
that
the
chalk
was
covered
with
i
know
that
there
was
a
here
from
this
fact
if
you
will
look
at
the
surface
of
the
chalk
where
the
sands
and
clays
lie
on
it
you
will
find
that
it
is
not
smooth
that
the
beds
do
not
rest
conformably
on
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
laid
down
quietly
by
successive
tides
while
the
chalk
below
was
still
soft
mud
so
far
from
it
the
chalk
must
have
become
hard
rock
and
have
been
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
sea
waves
for
centuries
perhaps
before
the
sands
began
to
cover
it
for
you
find
the
surface
of
the
chalk
furrowed
worn
into
deep
pits
which
are
often
filled
with
sand
and
gravel
and
rounded
lumps
of
chalk
you
may
see
this
for
yourselves
in
the
topmost
layer
of
any
round
here
you
may
see
even
in
some
places
the
holes
which
boring
shells
such
as
work
now
close
to
the
have
made
in
it
all
the
signs
in
fact
of
the
chalk
having
been
a
rocky
for
ages
the
first
bed
which
you
will
generally
find
upon
the
surface
of
the
chalk
is
a
layer
of
and
flints
among
these
are
met
with
in
many
places
beds
of
a
great
oyster
now
unknown
in
life
i
can
not
say
whether
there
are
any
here
but
at
reading
to
the
east
of
farnham
at
croydon
and
under
london
they
are
abundant
there
must
have
been
miles
and
miles
of
at
the
bottom
of
that
eocene
sea
among
the
beds
of
a
peculiar
pebble
which
we
shall
see
in
our
they
are
flints
but
very
small
dark
often
almost
black
and
quite
round
and
polished
compare
them
with
the
average
flints
of
the
pit
and
you
see
that
while
the
average
flints
are
fresh
from
the
chalk
these
have
plainly
been
rolled
and
rounded
for
years
they
are
except
in
their
dark
colour
exactly
such
shingle
as
forms
the
beach
about
hastings
and
brighton
they
are
the
shingle
beaches
of
the
eocene
sea
part
of
which
are
preserved
under
the
london
clay
to
the
north
a
vast
bed
of
them
remains
in
its
original
place
on
blackheath
near
london
while
part
in
the
district
to
the
south
which
the
london
clay
has
not
covered
have
been
washed
away
and
carried
into
our
to
mingle
with
other
flints
fresh
from
the
chalk
i
said
just
now
that
i
had
proof
that
a
great
tract
of
the
hills
which
are
now
bare
was
once
covered
with
sand
and
gravel
here
in
the
presence
of
these
dark
pebbles
is
a
proof
but
i
have
another
and
a
yet
more
curious
one
for
our
if
it
be
will
possibly
yield
us
another
and
a
more
curious
object
you
most
of
you
have
seen
i
dare
say
large
stones
several
feet
long
taken
out
of
these
pits
in
the
gravels
and
sands
at
pirbright
they
are
so
plentiful
that
they
are
quarried
for
and
good
they
make
being
exceedingly
hard
so
that
no
weather
will
wear
them
away
they
are
what
is
called
saccharine
that
is
sugary
sandstone
if
you
chip
off
a
bit
you
find
it
exactly
like
fine
sugar
only
intensely
hard
now
these
stones
have
become
very
famous
for
two
reasons
first
the
old
druids
used
them
to
build
their
temples
second
it
is
a
most
puzzling
question
where
they
came
from
first
they
were
used
to
build
druid
temples
if
you
go
to
the
further
lodge
of
dogmersfield
park
which
opens
close
to
the
inn
you
will
see
there
several
of
them
about
five
feet
high
each
set
up
on
end
they
run
in
a
line
through
the
plantation
past
the
lodge
along
the
park
palings
one
or
two
are
in
an
adjoining
field
they
are
the
remains
of
a
double
line
an
avenue
of
stones
which
has
formed
part
of
an
ancient
british
temple
i
know
no
more
than
that
of
that
i
am
certain
but
if
you
go
to
the
chalk
downs
of
wiltshire
you
see
these
temples
in
their
true
grandeur
you
have
all
heard
of
stonehenge
on
salisbury
plain
some
of
you
may
have
heard
of
the
great
druid
temple
at
abury
in
wilts
which
were
it
not
all
but
destroyed
would
be
even
grander
than
stonehenge
these
are
made
of
this
same
but
where
did
the
sandstone
come
from
you
may
say
it
grew
of
itself
in
our
sands
and
gravels
but
it
certainly
did
not
grow
on
the
top
of
a
bare
chalk
down
the
druids
must
have
brought
the
stones
thither
then
from
neighbouring
they
brought
them
no
doubt
but
not
from
the
stones
are
found
loose
on
the
downs
on
the
top
of
the
bare
chalk
in
places
where
they
plainly
have
not
been
put
by
man
for
instance
near
marlborough
is
a
long
valley
in
the
chalk
which
for
perhaps
half
a
mile
is
full
of
huge
blocks
of
this
sandstone
lying
about
on
the
turf
the
gray
wethers
the
shepherds
call
them
one
look
at
them
would
show
you
that
no
man
hand
had
put
them
there
they
look
like
a
river
of
stone
if
i
may
so
speak
as
if
some
mighty
flood
had
rolled
them
along
down
the
valley
and
there
left
them
behind
as
it
sunk
now
whence
did
they
come
many
answers
have
been
given
to
that
question
it
was
supposed
by
many
learned
men
that
they
had
been
brought
from
the
sandstone
mountains
of
wales
like
the
rolled
pebbles
of
which
i
spoke
just
now
but
the
answer
to
that
was
that
these
great
stones
are
not
rolled
they
are
all
squarish
more
or
less
their
edges
are
often
sharp
and
fresh
instead
of
being
polished
almost
into
balls
as
they
would
have
been
in
rolling
two
hundred
miles
along
a
bottom
before
such
a
tremendous
current
as
would
have
been
needed
to
carry
them
then
rose
a
very
clever
guess
they
must
have
been
carried
by
icebergs
as
much
silt
and
stones
we
know
has
been
carried
and
have
dropped
like
them
to
the
bottom
when
the
icebergs
melted
there
is
great
reason
in
that
but
we
have
cause
now
to
be
certain
that
they
did
not
come
from
wales
that
they
are
not
pieces
of
a
rock
older
than
the
chalk
but
much
younger
that
they
were
very
probably
formed
close
to
where
they
now
lie
now
how
do
we
know
that
if
you
are
not
tired
with
all
this
close
reasoning
i
will
tell
if
you
are
say
so
but
as
i
said
at
first
i
want
to
show
you
what
steady
and
sharp
this
same
geology
requires
even
in
the
nearest
well
then
i
do
not
think
our
will
tell
us
what
we
want
but
i
know
one
which
will
you
have
all
heard
of
lady
grenville
lovely
place
dropmore
beyond
maidenhead
where
the
taste
of
that
good
and
great
man
the
late
lord
grenville
converted
into
a
paradise
of
gardening
art
a
barren
common
full
of
clay
and
lord
grenville
wanted
stones
for
rockwork
in
those
pits
he
found
some
blocks
of
the
same
substance
as
those
of
stonehenge
or
pirbright
and
they
contain
the
answer
the
upper
surface
of
most
of
them
is
the
usual
clear
but
the
under
surface
of
many
has
round
pebbles
imbedded
in
it
looking
just
like
plums
in
a
pudding
the
smaller
above
and
the
larger
below
as
if
they
had
sunk
slowly
through
the
fluid
sand
before
the
whole
mass
froze
as
it
were
suddenly
together
and
these
pebbles
are
nothing
else
than
rolled
chalk
flints
that
settles
the
matter
the
pebbles
could
not
come
from
wales
there
are
no
flints
there
they
could
not
have
been
made
before
the
chalk
for
out
of
the
chalk
they
came
and
the
only
explanation
which
is
left
to
us
i
believe
is
that
over
the
tops
of
the
chalk
downs
over
our
heads
where
we
stand
now
there
once
stretched
layers
of
sand
and
gravel
tertiary
strata
as
i
have
been
calling
them
to
you
and
among
them
layers
of
this
same
hard
sandstone
when
the
floods
came
they
must
have
swept
away
all
these
soft
sands
and
gravels
possibly
to
make
the
bagshot
sands
of
which
i
shall
speak
presently
and
left
the
chalk
downs
bare
but
while
they
had
strength
to
move
the
finer
particles
they
had
not
generally
strength
to
move
these
sandstone
blocks
but
let
them
drop
through
and
remain
upon
the
floor
of
chalk
as
the
only
relics
of
a
tertiary
land
long
since
swept
away
while
some
were
carried
off
possibly
by
icebergs
as
far
as
pirbright
and
dropped
as
the
icebergs
melted
both
there
at
dogmersfield
and
also
though
few
and
small
in
eversley
and
the
neighbourhood
but
how
came
these
tertiary
sandstones
to
be
so
very
hard
while
the
strata
around
them
are
so
soft
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
know
no
more
than
you
experience
seems
to
say
that
stone
will
not
harden
into
that
sugary
crystalline
state
save
under
the
influence
of
great
heat
but
i
do
not
know
how
the
heat
should
have
got
to
that
layer
in
particular
possibly
there
may
have
been
eruptions
of
steam
of
boiling
water
holding
silex
flint
in
solution
a
very
rare
occurrence
but
something
similar
is
still
going
on
in
the
famous
geysers
or
boiling
springs
of
iceland
however
i
have
no
proof
that
this
was
the
cause
i
suppose
we
shall
find
out
some
day
how
it
happened
for
we
must
never
despair
of
finding
out
anything
which
depends
on
facts
part
of
the
town
of
odiham
and
of
north
warnborough
stands
i
believe
upon
these
lower
beds
which
are
called
by
geologists
the
woolwich
and
reading
beds
and
the
plastic
clays
from
the
good
brick
earth
which
is
so
often
found
among
them
but
as
soon
as
you
get
to
hook
common
and
to
dogmersfield
park
you
enter
on
a
fresh
deposit
the
great
bed
of
the
london
clay
i
give
you
a
rough
section
from
a
deep
well
at
dogmersfield
house
from
which
you
may
see
how
steeply
the
chalk
dips
down
here
under
the
clay
so
that
odiham
stands
as
it
were
on
the
chalk
beach
of
the
clay
sea
in
boring
that
well
there
were
pierced
forty
feet
of
the
upper
sands
the
bagshot
sands
of
which
i
shall
speak
presently
three
hundred
and
thirty
feet
of
london
clay
then
about
forty
feet
of
mottled
clays
and
sands
whether
the
chalk
was
then
reached
i
do
not
know
it
must
have
been
close
below
but
these
mottled
clays
and
sands
abound
in
water
being
indeed
the
layer
which
supplies
the
great
breweries
in
london
and
those
bottles
on
which
squirt
in
trafalgar
square
and
i
suppose
the
water
being
reached
the
boring
ceased
now
this
great
bed
of
london
clay
even
more
than
the
sands
below
it
deserves
the
title
of
a
new
creation
as
a
proof
some
of
you
may
recollect
when
the
railway
was
in
making
seeing
shells
some
of
them
large
and
handsome
ones
nautili
taken
out
of
the
london
clay
cutting
near
winchfield
nautili
similar
to
them
but
not
the
same
are
now
only
found
in
the
hottest
parts
of
the
indian
seas
and
what
is
more
not
one
of
those
shells
is
the
same
as
the
shells
you
find
in
the
chalk
throughout
this
great
bed
of
london
clay
the
shells
the
remains
of
plants
and
animals
are
altogether
a
new
creation
if
you
look
carefully
at
the
london
clay
shells
you
will
be
struck
with
their
general
likeness
to
fresh
east
indian
shells
and
rightly
so
they
do
approach
our
modern
live
shells
in
form
far
more
than
any
which
preceded
them
and
indeed
a
few
of
the
london
clay
shells
exist
still
in
foreign
seas
in
the
beds
again
above
the
clay
you
will
meet
with
still
more
species
which
are
yet
alive
while
in
the
chalk
and
below
the
chalk
you
never
meet
i
believe
with
a
single
recent
shell
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
london
clay
is
said
to
be
eocene
that
is
the
dawn
of
the
new
creation
the
chalk
i
told
you
seems
to
have
been
deposited
at
the
bottom
of
a
still
and
deep
ocean
but
the
london
clay
we
shall
find
was
deposited
in
a
comparatively
shallow
sea
least
in
depth
toward
high
clere
on
the
west
and
deepening
towards
london
and
the
mouth
of
the
thames
for
not
only
is
the
clay
deeper
as
you
travel
eastward
but
and
this
is
a
matter
to
which
geologists
attach
great
importance
the
character
of
the
shells
differs
in
different
parts
of
the
clay
you
must
know
that
certain
sorts
of
shells
live
in
deep
water
and
certain
in
shallow
you
may
prove
this
to
yourselves
on
a
small
scale
whenever
you
go
to
the
seaside
you
will
find
that
the
shell
which
crawl
on
the
rocks
about
mark
are
different
from
those
which
you
find
at
mark
and
those
again
different
from
the
shells
which
are
brought
up
by
the
from
the
sea
outside
now
the
lower
part
of
the
clay
near
here
contains
shells
but
if
you
went
forty
miles
to
the
eastward
you
would
find
in
the
corresponding
lower
beds
of
the
clay
water
shells
and
far
above
them
shells
such
as
you
find
here
a
fact
which
shows
plainly
that
this
end
of
the
clay
sea
was
shallowest
and
therefore
first
filled
up
but
again
and
this
is
a
very
curious
fact
between
the
time
of
the
plastic
clays
and
sands
with
their
and
black
pebbles
and
that
of
the
london
clay
great
changes
had
taken
place
the
plastic
clay
and
sands
were
deposited
during
a
period
of
earthquake
of
upheaval
and
subsidence
of
ancient
lands
and
therefore
of
violent
currents
and
flood
waves
seemingly
rushing
down
from
or
round
the
shores
of
that
wealden
island
to
the
south
of
us
on
the
shore
of
which
island
odiham
once
stood
we
know
this
from
the
great
irregularity
of
the
beds
while
the
absence
of
that
irregularity
proves
to
us
that
the
london
clay
was
deposited
in
a
quiet
sea
but
more
a
great
change
in
the
climate
of
this
country
had
taken
place
meanwhile
slowly
perhaps
but
still
it
had
taken
place
in
the
lowest
clay
above
the
chalk
are
found
at
reading
many
leaves
and
buds
and
seeds
of
trees
showing
that
there
was
dry
land
near
and
these
trees
as
far
as
the
best
botanists
can
guess
were
trees
like
those
we
have
in
england
now
not
of
the
same
species
of
course
but
still
trees
belonging
to
a
temperate
climate
which
had
its
regular
warm
summer
and
cold
winter
but
before
the
london
clay
had
been
all
deposited
this
temperate
climate
had
changed
to
a
tropical
one
and
the
plants
and
animals
of
the
upper
part
of
the
london
clay
had
begun
to
resemble
rather
those
of
the
mouths
of
the
african
extraordinary
as
this
is
it
is
certainly
true
we
know
that
the
country
near
the
mouth
of
the
thames
and
probably
the
land
round
us
here
was
low
rich
soil
some
half
under
water
some
overflowed
by
rivers
some
by
fresh
or
brackish
pools
we
know
all
this
for
we
find
the
shells
which
belong
to
a
shallow
sea
mixed
with
ones
we
know
too
that
the
climate
of
this
rich
lowland
was
a
tropical
one
we
know
that
the
neighbourhood
of
the
isle
of
sheppey
at
the
mouth
of
the
thames
was
covered
with
rich
tropic
vegetation
with
screw
pines
and
acacias
canes
and
gourds
tenanted
by
opossums
bats
and
vultures
that
huge
snakes
twined
themselves
along
the
ground
tortoises
dived
in
the
pools
and
crocodiles
basked
on
the
muds
while
the
neighbouring
seas
swarmed
with
sharks
as
huge
and
terrible
as
those
of
a
west
indian
shore
it
is
all
very
wonderful
ladies
and
gentlemen
but
be
it
is
and
all
we
can
say
is
with
the
mussulman
god
is
great
and
then
when
none
knows
but
god
there
came
a
time
in
which
some
convulsion
of
nature
changed
the
course
of
the
sea
currents
and
probably
destroyed
a
vast
tract
of
land
between
england
and
france
and
probably
also
that
sunken
island
of
atlantis
of
which
old
plato
dreamed
the
vast
tract
which
connected
for
ages
ireland
cornwall
brittany
and
portugal
that
convulsion
covered
up
the
rich
clays
with
those
barren
sands
and
gravels
which
now
rise
in
flat
and
dreary
steppes
on
the
beacon
hill
aldershot
moors
hartford
bridge
flat
frimley
ridges
and
windsor
forest
that
rich
old
world
was
all
swept
away
and
instead
of
it
desolation
and
barrenness
piling
up
slowly
on
its
ruins
a
desert
of
sand
and
shingle
rising
inch
by
inch
out
of
a
lifeless
sea
there
is
something
very
awful
to
me
in
the
barrenness
of
those
bagshot
sands
after
the
rich
tropic
life
of
the
london
clay
not
a
fossil
is
to
be
found
in
them
for
miles
save
a
few
shells
i
believe
near
pirbright
there
is
not
a
hint
that
a
living
being
inhabited
that
doleful
sea
but
do
not
suppose
gentlemen
and
ladies
that
we
have
yet
got
our
made
or
that
the
pebbles
of
which
it
is
composed
are
near
the
end
of
their
weary
journey
poor
old
stones
driven
out
of
their
native
chalk
rolled
for
ages
on
a
they
have
tried
to
get
a
few
centuries
sleep
in
the
eocene
sands
on
the
top
of
the
chalk
hills
behind
us
while
the
london
clay
was
being
deposited
peacefully
in
the
tropic
sea
below
and
behold
they
are
swept
out
once
more
and
hurled
upon
the
clay
two
hundred
feet
over
our
heads
over
our
heads
remember
we
have
come
now
to
a
time
when
hartford
bridge
flats
stretched
away
to
the
beacon
hill
and
many
a
mile
to
the
even
down
into
kent
and
stretched
also
over
winchfield
and
dogmersfield
hither
what
broke
them
up
what
furrowed
out
their
steep
what
formed
the
magnificent
escarpment
of
the
beacon
hill
or
the
lesser
one
of
finchamstead
ridges
what
swept
away
all
but
a
thin
cap
of
them
on
the
upper
part
of
dogmersfield
park
another
under
winchfield
house
another
at
bearwood
and
so
forth
the
convulsions
of
a
third
world
more
fertile
in
animal
life
than
those
which
preceded
it
but
also
more
terrible
and
rapid
if
possible
in
its
changes
of
this
third
world
the
one
which
so
to
speak
immediately
preceded
our
own
we
know
little
yet
its
changes
are
so
complicated
that
geologists
have
as
yet
hardly
arranged
them
but
what
we
can
see
i
will
sketch
for
you
shortly
a
great
continent
to
the
south
england
probably
an
island
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
united
to
the
continent
by
new
beds
the
mammoth
ranging
up
to
where
we
now
stand
then
a
period
of
upheaval
the
german
ocean
becomes
dry
land
the
thames
a
far
larger
river
than
now
runs
far
eastward
to
join
the
seine
and
the
rhine
and
other
rivers
which
altogether
flow
northward
in
one
enormous
stream
toward
the
open
sea
between
scotland
and
norway
and
with
this
a
new
creation
of
enormous
quadrupeds
as
yet
unknown
countless
herds
of
elephants
pastured
by
the
side
of
that
mighty
river
where
now
the
norfolk
fisherman
dredges
their
teeth
and
bones
far
out
in
open
sea
the
hippopotamus
floundered
in
the
severn
the
rhinoceros
ranged
over
the
counties
enormous
elk
and
oxen
of
species
now
extinct
inhabited
the
vast
fir
and
larch
forests
which
stretched
from
norfolk
to
the
farthest
part
of
wales
hyenas
and
bears
double
the
size
of
our
modern
ones
and
here
and
there
the
tiger
now
extinct
prowled
out
of
the
caverns
in
the
limestone
hills
to
seek
their
bulky
prey
we
see
too
a
period
whether
the
same
as
this
or
after
it
i
know
not
yet
in
which
the
mountains
of
wales
and
cumberland
rose
to
the
limits
of
eternal
frost
and
snowdon
was
indeed
snowdon
an
alp
down
whose
valleys
vast
glaciers
spread
far
and
wide
while
the
reindeer
of
lapland
the
marmot
of
the
alps
and
the
musk
ox
of
hudson
bay
fed
upon
alpine
plants
a
few
of
whose
descendants
still
survive
as
tokens
of
the
long
past
age
of
ice
and
at
every
successive
upheaval
of
the
western
mountains
the
displaced
waters
of
the
ocean
swept
over
the
lower
lands
filling
the
valley
of
the
thames
and
of
the
wey
with
vast
beds
of
drift
gravel
containing
among
its
chalk
flints
fragments
of
stone
from
every
rock
between
here
and
wales
teeth
of
elephants
skulls
of
ox
and
musk
ox
while
icebergs
breaking
away
from
the
glaciers
of
the
welsh
alps
sailed
down
over
the
spot
where
we
now
are
dropping
their
imbedded
stones
and
silt
to
confuse
more
utterly
than
before
the
records
of
a
world
rocking
and
throbbing
above
the
shocks
of
the
nether
fire
at
last
the
convulsions
get
weak
the
german
ocean
becomes
sea
once
more
the
alps
sink
again
to
a
level
far
lower
even
than
their
present
one
only
to
rise
again
but
not
so
high
as
before
and
fill
many
of
our
lower
valleys
whales
by
hundreds
are
stranded
as
in
the
farnham
vale
where
is
now
dry
land
gradually
the
sunken
land
begins
to
rise
again
and
falls
perhaps
again
and
rises
again
after
that
more
and
more
gently
each
time
till
as
it
were
the
panting
earth
worn
out
with
the
fierce
passions
of
her
fiery
youth
has
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
once
more
and
this
new
world
of
man
is
made
and
among
it
i
know
not
when
or
by
what
diluvial
wave
out
of
hundreds
which
swept
the
pleistocene
earth
was
deposited
our
little
from
which
we
started
on
our
journey
through
three
worlds
when
enough
for
us
that
he
knows
when
in
whose
hand
are
the
times
and
the
seasons
god
the
father
of
the
spirits
of
all
flesh
and
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
take
from
hence
a
lesson
i
have
brought
you
a
long
and
a
strange
road
starting
from
this
seemingly
uninteresting
pit
we
have
come
upon
the
records
of
three
older
worlds
and
on
hints
of
worlds
far
older
yet
we
have
come
to
them
by
no
theories
no
dreams
of
the
fancy
but
by
plain
honest
reasoning
from
plain
honest
facts
that
wonderful
things
had
happened
we
could
see
but
why
they
had
happened
we
saw
not
when
we
began
to
ask
the
reason
of
this
thing
or
of
that
remember
how
we
had
to
stop
and
laying
our
hands
upon
our
mouths
only
say
with
the
mussulman
god
is
great
we
pick
our
steps
by
lanthorn
light
indeed
and
slowly
but
still
surely
and
safely
along
a
dark
and
difficult
road
but
just
as
we
are
beginning
to
pride
ourselves
on
having
found
our
way
so
cleverly
we
come
to
an
edge
of
darkness
and
see
before
our
feet
a
bottomless
abyss
down
which
our
feeble
lanthorn
will
not
throw
its
light
a
yard
such
is
true
science
is
it
a
study
to
make
men
conceited
and
sufficient
believe
it
not
if
a
scientific
man
or
one
who
calls
himself
so
be
conceited
the
conceit
was
there
before
the
science
part
of
his
natural
defects
and
if
it
stays
there
long
after
he
has
really
given
himself
to
the
patient
study
of
nature
then
is
he
one
of
those
of
whom
solomon
has
said
though
you
pound
a
fool
in
a
mortar
among
wheat
with
a
pestle
yet
will
not
his
folly
depart
from
him
for
what
more
fit
to
knock
the
conceit
out
of
a
student
than
being
pounded
by
these
same
hard
facts
which
tell
him
just
enough
to
let
him
know
how
little
he
knows
what
more
fit
to
make
a
man
patient
humble
reverent
than
being
stopped
short
as
every
man
of
science
is
after
each
steps
by
some
tremendous
riddle
which
he
can
not
explain
which
he
may
have
to
wait
years
to
get
explained
which
as
far
as
he
can
see
will
never
be
explained
at
all
the
poet
says
an
undevout
astronomer
is
mad
and
he
says
truth
it
is
only
those
who
know
a
little
of
nature
who
fancy
that
they
know
much
i
have
heard
a
young
man
say
after
hearing
a
few
popular
chemical
lectures
and
seeing
a
few
bottle
and
squirt
experiments
oh
water
water
is
only
oxygen
and
hydrogen
as
if
he
knew
all
about
it
while
the
true
chemist
would
smile
sadly
enough
at
the
youth
hasty
conceit
and
say
in
his
heart
well
he
is
a
lucky
fellow
if
he
knows
all
about
it
it
is
more
than
i
do
i
do
know
what
oxygen
is
or
hydrogen
either
i
do
even
know
whether
there
are
any
such
things
at
all
i
see
certain
effects
in
my
experiments
which
i
must
attribute
to
some
cause
and
i
call
that
cause
oxygen
because
i
must
call
it
something
and
other
effects
which
i
must
attribute
to
another
cause
and
i
call
that
hydrogen
but
as
for
oxygen
i
do
know
whether
it
really
exists
i
think
it
very
possible
that
it
is
only
an
effect
of
something
else
another
form
of
a
something
which
seems
to
make
phosphorus
iodine
bromine
and
certain
other
substances
and
as
for
hydrogen
i
know
as
little
about
it
i
do
know
but
what
all
the
metals
gold
silver
iron
tin
sodium
potassium
and
so
forth
are
not
different
forms
of
hydrogen
or
of
something
else
which
is
the
parent
of
hydrogen
in
fact
i
know
but
very
little
about
the
matter
except
this
that
i
do
know
very
little
and
that
the
more
i
experiment
and
the
more
i
analyse
the
more
unexpected
puzzles
and
wonders
i
find
and
the
more
i
expect
to
find
till
my
dying
day
true
i
know
a
vast
number
of
facts
and
laws
thank
god
and
some
very
useful
ones
among
them
but
as
to
the
ultimate
and
first
causes
of
those
facts
and
laws
i
know
no
more
than
the
outside
and
can
say
no
more
than
he
does
when
he
reads
in
the
psalms
at
school
i
and
all
around
me
are
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
marvellous
are
thy
works
and
that
my
soul
knoweth
right
well
and
so
my
friends
though
i
have
seemed
to
talk
to
you
of
great
matters
this
night
of
the
making
and
the
destruction
of
world
after
world
yet
what
does
all
i
have
said
come
to
i
have
not
got
one
step
beyond
what
the
old
psalmist
learnt
amid
the
earthquakes
and
volcanoes
of
the
pastures
and
the
forests
of
palestine
three
thousand
years
ago
i
have
not
added
to
his
words
i
have
only
given
you
new
facts
to
prove
that
he
had
exhausted
the
moral
lesson
of
the
subject
when
he
said
these
all
wait
upon
thee
that
thou
mayest
give
them
their
meat
in
due
season
thou
givest
and
they
gather
thou
openest
thy
hand
and
they
are
filled
with
good
thou
hidest
thy
face
they
are
troubled
thou
takest
away
their
breath
they
die
and
return
to
their
dust
thou
sendest
forth
thy
spirit
they
are
created
and
thou
renewest
the
face
of
the
earth
but
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
endure
for
ever
the
lord
shall
rejoice
in
his
works
amen
how
to
study
natural
history
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
speak
to
you
as
to
persons
assembled
somewhat
no
doubt
for
amusement
but
still
more
for
instruction
institutions
such
as
this
were
originally
founded
for
the
purpose
of
instruction
to
supply
to
those
who
wish
to
educate
themselves
some
of
the
advantages
of
a
regular
course
of
scholastic
or
scientific
training
by
means
of
classes
and
of
lectures
i
myself
prize
classes
far
higher
than
i
do
lectures
from
my
own
experience
a
lecture
is
often
a
very
dangerous
method
of
teaching
it
is
apt
to
engender
in
the
mind
of
men
ungrounded
conceit
and
sciolism
or
the
bad
habit
of
knowing
about
subjects
without
really
knowing
the
subject
itself
a
young
man
hears
an
interesting
lecture
and
carries
away
from
it
doubtless
a
great
many
new
facts
and
results
but
he
really
must
not
go
home
fancying
himself
a
much
wiser
man
and
why
because
he
has
only
heard
the
lecturer
side
of
the
story
he
has
been
forced
to
take
the
facts
and
the
results
on
trust
he
has
not
examined
the
facts
for
himself
he
has
had
no
share
in
the
process
by
which
the
results
were
arrived
at
in
short
he
has
not
gone
into
the
real
scientia
that
is
the
knowing
of
the
matter
he
has
gained
a
certain
quantity
of
information
but
he
has
gained
nothing
in
mental
training
nothing
in
the
great
art
of
learning
the
art
of
finding
out
things
for
himself
and
of
discerning
truth
from
falsehood
of
course
where
the
lecture
is
a
scientific
one
illustrated
by
diagrams
this
defect
is
not
so
extreme
but
still
the
lecturer
who
shows
you
experiments
is
forced
to
choose
those
which
shall
be
startling
and
amusing
rather
than
important
he
is
seldom
or
never
able
unless
he
is
a
man
of
at
once
the
deepest
science
and
the
most
extraordinary
powers
of
amusing
to
give
you
those
experiments
in
the
proper
order
which
will
unfold
the
subject
to
you
step
by
step
and
after
all
an
experiment
is
worth
very
little
to
you
unless
you
perform
it
yourself
ask
questions
about
it
or
vary
it
a
little
to
solve
difficulties
which
arise
in
your
own
mind
now
mind
i
do
not
say
all
this
to
make
you
give
up
attending
lectures
heaven
forbid
they
amuse
that
is
they
turn
the
mind
off
from
business
they
relax
it
and
as
it
were
bathe
and
refresh
it
with
new
thoughts
after
the
day
drudgery
or
the
commonplaces
they
fill
it
with
pleasant
and
healthful
images
for
afterthought
above
all
they
make
one
feel
what
a
fair
wide
wonderful
world
one
lives
in
how
much
there
is
to
be
known
and
how
little
one
knows
and
to
the
earnest
man
suggest
future
subjects
of
study
i
only
ask
you
not
to
expect
from
lectures
what
they
can
never
give
but
as
to
what
they
can
give
i
consider
i
assure
you
the
lecturer
vocation
a
most
honourable
one
in
the
present
day
even
if
we
look
on
him
as
on
a
mere
advertiser
of
nature
wonders
as
such
i
appear
here
not
to
teach
you
natural
history
for
that
you
can
only
teach
yourselves
but
to
set
before
you
the
subject
and
its
value
and
if
possible
allure
some
of
you
to
the
study
of
it
i
have
said
that
lectures
do
not
supply
mental
training
that
only
personal
study
can
do
that
the
next
question
is
what
study
and
that
is
a
question
which
i
do
not
answer
in
a
hurry
when
i
say
the
study
of
natural
history
it
is
not
certainly
a
study
which
a
young
man
entering
on
the
business
of
would
be
likely
to
take
up
to
him
naturally
man
is
the
most
important
subject
his
first
wish
is
to
know
the
human
world
to
know
what
men
are
what
they
have
thought
what
they
have
done
and
therefore
you
find
that
poetry
history
politics
and
philosophy
are
the
matters
which
most
attract
the
student
i
do
not
blame
him
but
he
seems
to
me
to
be
beginning
at
the
middle
rather
than
at
the
beginning
i
fell
into
the
same
fault
myself
more
than
once
when
i
was
younger
and
meddled
in
matters
too
high
for
me
instead
of
refraining
my
soul
and
keeping
it
low
so
i
can
sympathise
with
others
who
do
so
but
i
can
assure
them
that
they
will
find
such
lofty
studies
do
them
good
only
in
proportion
as
they
have
first
learnt
the
art
of
learning
unless
they
have
learnt
to
face
facts
manfully
to
discriminate
between
them
skilfully
to
draw
conclusions
from
them
rigidly
unless
they
have
learnt
in
all
things
to
look
not
for
what
they
would
like
to
be
true
but
for
what
is
true
because
god
has
done
it
and
it
can
not
be
undone
then
they
will
be
in
danger
of
taking
up
only
the
books
which
suit
their
own
prejudices
and
every
one
has
his
prejudices
and
using
them
not
to
correct
their
own
notions
but
to
corroborate
and
pamper
them
to
confirm
themselves
in
their
first
narrow
guesses
instead
of
enlarging
those
guesses
into
certainty
the
son
of
a
tory
turn
will
read
tory
books
the
son
of
a
radical
turn
radical
books
and
the
green
spectacles
of
party
and
prejudice
will
be
deepened
in
hue
as
he
reads
on
instead
of
being
thrown
away
for
the
clear
white
glass
of
truth
which
will
show
him
reason
in
all
honest
sides
and
good
in
all
honest
men
but
says
the
young
man
i
wish
to
be
and
i
study
for
that
very
purpose
i
will
be
fair
i
will
be
patient
i
will
hear
all
sides
ere
i
judge
and
i
doubt
not
that
he
speaks
honestly
but
i
quote
with
all
reverence
though
the
spirit
be
willing
the
flesh
is
weak
studies
which
have
to
do
with
history
man
thoughts
man
feelings
are
too
exciting
too
personal
often
alas
too
tragical
to
allow
us
to
read
them
calmly
at
first
the
men
and
women
of
whom
we
read
are
so
like
ourselves
for
the
human
heart
is
the
same
in
every
age
that
we
unconsciously
begin
to
love
or
hate
them
in
the
first
five
minutes
and
read
history
as
we
do
a
novel
hurrying
on
to
see
when
the
supposed
hero
and
heroine
get
safely
married
and
the
supposed
villain
safely
hanged
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
having
forgotten
all
the
while
in
our
haste
to
ascertain
which
is
the
hero
and
which
is
the
villain
mary
queen
of
scots
was
beautiful
and
unfortunate
what
heart
would
not
bleed
for
a
beautiful
woman
in
trouble
why
stop
to
ask
whether
she
brought
it
on
herself
she
was
seventeen
years
in
prison
why
stop
to
ascertain
what
sort
of
a
prison
it
was
and
as
for
her
guilt
the
famous
casket
letters
were
of
course
a
vile
forgery
impossible
that
they
could
be
true
hoot
down
the
and
disagreeable
and
troublesome
man
of
facts
who
will
persist
in
his
stupid
attempt
to
disenchant
you
and
repeat
but
the
casket
letters
were
not
a
forgery
and
we
can
prove
it
if
you
will
but
listen
to
the
facts
her
prison
as
we
will
show
you
if
you
will
be
patient
and
listen
to
facts
consisted
in
greater
pomp
and
luxury
than
that
of
most
noblemen
with
horses
hounds
books
music
liberty
to
hunt
and
amuse
herself
in
every
way
even
in
intriguing
with
every
court
of
europe
as
we
can
show
you
again
if
you
will
be
patient
and
listen
to
facts
and
she
herself
was
a
very
wicked
and
false
woman
an
adulteress
and
a
murderess
though
fearfully
in
early
youth
who
sowed
the
wind
poor
wretch
from
girlhood
to
old
age
and
therefore
reaped
the
whirlwind
receiving
the
just
reward
of
her
deeds
catherine
of
russia
meanwhile
instead
of
being
beautiful
and
unfortunate
was
only
handsome
and
successful
brand
her
as
a
disgrace
to
human
nature
the
morals
and
ways
of
the
two
were
pretty
much
on
a
par
with
these
exceptions
in
catherine
favour
that
she
had
strong
passions
mary
none
that
she
lived
in
outer
darkness
and
practical
heathendom
while
mary
had
the
light
shining
all
round
her
and
refused
it
deliberately
again
and
again
what
matter
to
the
sentimentalist
hiss
the
stupid
man
of
facts
by
all
means
what
if
he
be
right
he
has
no
business
to
be
right
we
will
consider
him
wrong
accordingly
of
our
own
sovereign
will
and
pleasure
for
after
all
if
we
had
the
facts
put
before
us
says
the
conscience
of
many
a
hearer
we
could
not
judge
of
them
we
read
to
be
amused
and
instructed
not
to
study
cases
like
so
many
barristers
so
is
history
read
and
so
alas
is
history
written
too
often
for
want
of
a
steady
and
severe
training
which
would
enable
people
to
judge
dispassionately
of
facts
in
politics
the
case
is
the
same
in
poetry
which
appeals
more
directly
to
the
feelings
it
must
needs
be
still
worse
as
has
been
shown
sadly
enough
of
late
by
the
success
of
several
poems
in
which
every
possible
form
of
bad
taste
has
only
met
with
unbounded
admiration
from
the
many
who
have
not
had
their
senses
exercised
to
discern
between
good
and
evil
now
what
seems
to
me
to
be
wanted
for
young
minds
is
a
study
in
which
no
personal
likes
or
dislikes
shall
tempt
them
out
of
the
path
of
mental
honesty
a
study
in
which
they
shall
be
free
to
look
at
facts
exactly
as
they
are
and
draw
their
conclusions
patiently
and
dispassionately
and
such
a
study
i
have
found
in
that
of
natural
history
do
not
fancy
it
i
beg
you
an
easy
thing
to
judge
fairly
of
facts
even
to
discover
the
facts
at
all
when
they
are
staring
you
in
the
face
and
to
see
what
it
is
that
you
do
see
any
lawyer
will
tell
you
that
if
you
ask
three
honest
men
to
bear
testimony
concerning
an
event
which
happened
but
yesterday
none
of
them
if
he
be
at
all
an
interested
party
will
give
you
exactly
the
same
account
of
it
not
that
he
wishes
to
say
what
is
untrue
but
that
different
parts
of
the
whole
matter
having
struck
each
man
with
different
force
a
different
picture
has
been
left
on
each
man
memory
i
have
been
utterly
astounded
of
late
in
investigating
these
strange
stories
of
and
to
find
how
even
and
persons
as
one
had
fancied
them
become
unable
to
examine
fairly
into
a
thing
the
moment
the
desire
to
believe
has
entered
the
heart
and
how
no
amount
of
mere
cultivation
if
the
scientific
habit
of
mind
be
wanting
can
prevent
people
from
finding
as
in
miracles
in
the
most
simple
mechanical
accidents
or
from
becoming
as
in
the
dupes
of
the
most
clumsy
palpable
and
degrading
impostures
even
after
they
have
been
exposed
over
and
over
again
in
print
humiliating
indeed
it
is
in
this
so
and
boastful
nineteenth
century
amid
railroads
electric
telegraphs
and
all
the
wonders
of
our
inductive
science
to
find
exploded
superstitions
leaping
back
into
life
even
more
monstrous
and
irrational
than
in
past
ages
and
to
see
our
modern
pharisees
and
sadducees
like
those
in
judea
of
old
seeking
after
a
sign
of
an
unseen
world
and
being
unable
to
find
one
either
in
the
heaven
above
or
in
the
earth
beneath
discovering
it
at
last
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
speak
the
words
under
the
against
such
extravagances
and
against
the
loose
sentimental
tone
of
mind
which
begets
them
hardly
anything
would
be
a
better
safeguard
than
the
habitual
study
of
nature
the
chemist
the
geologist
the
botanist
the
zoologist
has
to
deal
with
facts
which
will
make
him
master
of
them
and
of
himself
only
in
proportion
as
he
obeys
them
many
of
you
doubtless
know
lord
bacon
famous
apothegm
nature
is
only
conquered
by
obeying
her
and
will
understand
me
when
i
say
that
you
can
not
understand
much
less
use
for
scientific
purposes
the
meanest
pebble
unless
you
first
obey
that
pebble
paradoxical
but
true
see
this
pebble
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
picked
up
out
of
the
street
as
i
came
along
it
shall
be
my
only
object
there
the
thing
is
and
is
as
it
is
and
in
no
other
way
and
such
it
will
be
and
so
it
will
behave
and
act
in
spite
of
me
and
all
my
fancies
about
it
and
notions
of
what
it
ought
to
have
been
like
and
what
it
ought
to
have
done
it
is
a
thought
of
god
and
strong
by
the
eternal
laws
of
matter
which
are
the
will
of
god
it
has
the
whole
universe
sun
and
stars
and
all
backing
it
by
god
appointment
to
keep
it
where
it
is
and
what
it
is
and
till
as
lord
bacon
has
it
i
have
discovered
and
obeyed
the
will
of
god
revealed
in
that
pebble
it
is
to
me
a
riddle
more
insoluble
than
the
sphinx
a
fortress
more
impregnable
than
sevastopol
i
may
crush
it
but
destroying
is
not
conquering
but
i
can
not
even
mend
the
road
with
it
prudently
until
i
have
discovered
whether
almighty
god
has
made
it
fit
to
mend
roads
with
i
may
have
the
genius
of
a
plato
or
of
a
shakespeare
but
all
my
genius
will
not
avail
to
penetrate
that
pebble
or
see
anything
in
it
but
a
little
round
dirty
stone
until
i
have
treated
the
pebble
with
reverence
as
a
thing
independent
of
my
likes
and
dislikes
fancies
and
aspirations
and
have
asked
it
humbly
to
tell
me
its
story
taking
counsel
meanwhile
of
hundreds
of
kindred
pebbles
each
as
silent
and
reserved
as
this
one
and
watched
and
listened
patiently
through
many
mistakes
and
misreadings
to
what
it
has
to
say
for
itself
and
what
god
has
made
it
to
be
and
then
at
last
that
little
black
rounded
pebble
from
the
street
outside
may
and
will
surely
if
i
be
patient
and
honest
enough
tell
me
a
tale
wilder
and
grander
than
any
which
i
could
have
dreamed
for
myself
will
shame
the
meanness
of
my
imagination
by
the
awful
magnificence
of
god
facts
and
say
to
me
ages
and
aeons
since
thousands
on
thousands
of
years
before
there
was
a
man
to
till
the
ground
i
the
little
pebble
was
a
living
sponge
in
the
milky
depths
of
the
great
chalk
ocean
and
hundreds
of
living
atomies
each
more
fantastic
than
a
dreams
swam
round
me
and
grew
on
me
and
multiplied
till
i
became
a
tiny
hive
of
wonders
each
one
of
which
would
take
you
a
life
to
understand
and
then
i
can
not
yet
tell
you
how
and
till
i
tell
you
you
will
never
know
the
delicate
in
my
skin
gathered
other
particles
of
flint
to
them
and
i
and
all
my
inhabitants
became
a
stone
and
the
settled
round
us
i
know
not
how
and
covered
us
in
and
for
ages
on
ages
i
lay
buried
in
the
nether
dark
and
felt
the
glow
of
the
nether
fires
and
was
cracked
and
tossed
by
a
hundred
earthquakes
again
and
again
i
have
been
part
of
an
island
and
then
again
sunk
beneath
the
sea
to
be
upheaved
again
after
long
centuries
till
i
saw
the
light
once
more
and
dropped
from
the
face
of
some
chalk
cliff
far
away
among
high
hills
which
have
long
since
been
swept
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
was
tossed
by
currents
till
i
became
a
pebble
on
the
beach
while
reading
was
a
in
a
shallow
sea
there
i
lay
and
rolled
till
i
was
rounded
for
many
a
century
more
till
flood
after
flood
past
over
me
and
a
new
earth
was
made
and
i
was
mixed
up
with
fresh
flints
from
wasting
and
with
freestones
from
the
gloucestershire
wolds
and
with
from
the
mountains
of
wales
while
over
me
swept
the
carcases
of
drowned
elephants
and
bisons
and
many
a
monstrous
beast
and
above
me
floated
uprooted
palms
and
tropic
fruits
and
seeds
and
the
wrecks
of
a
dying
world
and
then
there
came
another
age
and
it
grew
wondrous
cold
and
ice
came
floating
by
as
green
as
emerald
and
as
the
icebergs
melted
in
the
sun
the
stones
and
the
silt
fell
out
of
them
and
covered
me
up
and
i
was
in
darkness
once
more
vexed
by
many
an
earthquake
till
i
became
part
of
this
brave
english
land
and
now
i
am
a
pebble
here
in
reading
street
to
be
ground
beneath
the
wheels
of
busy
men
and
yet
you
can
not
kill
me
or
hinder
my
fulfilling
the
law
which
can
not
be
broken
this
year
i
am
a
pebble
in
the
street
and
next
year
i
shall
be
dust
upon
the
fields
above
and
the
year
after
that
i
shall
be
alive
again
and
rise
from
the
ground
as
fair
green
bearing
up
food
for
the
use
of
man
and
even
after
that
you
can
not
kill
me
the
trampled
and
sodden
straw
will
rot
only
to
enter
into
a
new
life
and
i
shall
pass
through
a
fresh
cycle
of
strange
adventures
age
after
age
till
time
shall
be
no
more
doing
my
work
in
my
generation
and
fulfilling
to
the
last
the
will
of
god
as
faithfully
as
when
i
was
the
sponge
in
the
abysses
of
the
old
chalk
sea
all
this
and
more
gentlemen
and
ladies
the
pebble
could
tell
to
you
and
will
but
he
is
old
and
venerable
and
like
old
men
he
wishes
to
be
approached
with
respect
and
does
not
like
to
be
questioned
too
much
or
too
rapidly
so
that
you
must
not
be
offended
if
you
meet
with
more
than
one
rebuff
from
him
or
if
he
keeps
stubborn
silence
till
he
has
seen
that
you
are
a
modest
and
attentive
person
to
whom
it
is
worth
while
to
open
a
little
of
his
forty
or
fifty
thousand
years
experience
second
only
to
the
good
effect
of
this
study
on
the
logical
faculty
seems
to
me
to
be
its
effect
on
the
imagination
not
merely
in
such
objects
as
the
pebble
whose
history
i
have
so
hastily
but
i
must
add
faithfully
sketched
but
in
the
tiniest
piece
of
mould
on
a
decayed
fruit
the
tiniest
animalcule
from
the
stagnant
pool
will
imagination
find
inexhaustible
wonders
and
fancy
a
and
i
beg
my
elder
hearers
not
to
look
on
this
as
light
praise
imagination
is
a
valuable
thing
and
even
if
it
were
not
it
is
a
thing
a
real
thing
a
faculty
which
every
one
has
and
with
which
you
must
do
something
you
can
not
ignore
it
it
will
assert
its
own
existence
you
will
be
wise
not
to
neglect
it
in
young
children
for
if
you
do
not
provide
wholesome
food
for
it
it
will
find
unwholesome
food
for
itself
i
know
that
many
especially
men
of
business
are
inclined
to
sneer
at
it
and
ask
what
is
the
use
of
it
the
simple
answer
is
god
has
made
it
and
he
has
made
nothing
in
vain
but
you
will
find
that
in
practice
in
action
in
business
imagination
is
a
most
useful
faculty
and
is
so
much
mental
capital
whensoever
it
is
properly
trained
consider
but
this
one
thing
that
without
imagination
no
man
can
possibly
invent
even
the
pettiest
object
that
it
is
one
of
the
faculties
which
essentially
raises
man
above
the
brutes
by
enabling
him
to
create
for
himself
that
the
first
savage
who
ever
made
a
hatchet
must
have
imagined
that
hatchet
to
himself
ere
he
began
it
that
every
new
article
of
commerce
every
new
opening
for
trade
must
be
arrived
at
by
acts
of
imagination
by
the
very
same
faculty
which
the
poet
or
the
painter
employs
only
on
a
different
class
of
objects
remember
that
this
faculty
is
present
in
some
strength
in
every
mind
of
any
power
in
every
mind
which
can
do
more
than
follow
helplessly
in
the
beaten
track
and
do
nothing
but
what
it
has
seen
others
do
already
and
then
see
whether
it
be
not
worth
while
to
give
the
young
a
study
which
above
all
others
is
fitted
to
keep
this
important
and
universal
faculty
in
health
now
from
fifty
to
years
ago
under
the
influence
of
the
franklin
and
edgeworth
school
of
education
imagination
was
at
a
discount
that
school
was
a
good
school
enough
but
here
was
one
of
its
faults
it
taught
people
to
look
on
imagination
as
quite
a
useless
dangerous
unpractical
bad
thing
a
sort
of
mental
disease
and
now
as
is
usual
after
an
unfair
depreciation
of
anything
has
come
a
revolution
and
an
equally
unfair
glorifying
of
the
imagination
the
present
generation
have
found
out
suddenly
that
the
despised
faculty
is
worth
something
and
therefore
are
ready
to
believe
it
worth
everything
so
that
nowadays
to
judge
from
the
praise
heaped
on
some
poets
the
mere
possession
of
imagination
however
ill
regulated
will
atone
for
every
error
of
false
taste
bad
english
carelessness
for
truth
and
even
for
coarseness
blasphemy
and
want
of
common
morality
and
it
is
no
longer
charity
but
fancy
which
is
to
cover
the
multitude
of
sins
the
fact
is
that
youth
will
always
be
the
period
of
imagination
and
the
business
of
a
good
education
will
always
be
to
prevent
that
imagination
from
being
thrown
inward
and
producing
a
mental
fever
diseasing
itself
and
the
whole
character
by
feeding
on
its
own
fancies
its
own
day
dreams
its
own
morbid
feelings
its
likes
and
dislikes
even
if
it
do
not
take
at
last
to
viler
food
to
french
novels
and
lawless
thoughts
which
are
but
too
common
alas
though
we
will
not
speak
of
them
here
to
turn
the
imagination
not
inwards
but
outwards
to
give
it
a
class
of
objects
which
may
excite
wonder
reverence
the
love
of
novelty
and
of
discovering
without
heating
the
brain
or
exciting
the
passions
this
is
one
of
the
great
problems
of
education
and
i
believe
from
experience
that
the
study
of
natural
history
supplies
in
great
part
what
we
want
the
earnest
naturalist
is
pretty
sure
to
have
obtained
that
great
need
of
all
men
to
get
rid
of
self
he
who
after
the
hours
of
business
finds
himself
with
a
mind
relaxed
and
wearied
will
not
be
tempted
to
sit
at
home
dreaming
over
impossible
scenes
of
pleasure
or
to
go
for
amusement
to
haunts
of
coarse
excitement
if
he
have
in
every
and
wood
land
and
running
stream
in
every
bird
among
the
boughs
and
every
cloud
above
his
head
stores
of
interest
which
will
enable
him
to
forget
awhile
himself
and
man
and
all
the
cares
even
all
the
hopes
of
life
and
to
be
alone
with
the
inexhaustible
beauty
and
glory
of
nature
and
of
god
who
made
her
an
hour
or
two
every
day
spent
after
in
botany
geology
entomology
at
the
telescope
or
the
microscope
is
so
much
refreshment
gained
for
the
mind
for
labour
so
much
rest
for
irritated
or
anxious
feelings
often
so
much
saved
from
frivolity
or
sin
and
how
easy
this
pursuit
how
abundant
the
subjects
of
it
look
round
you
here
within
the
reach
of
every
one
of
you
are
wonders
beyond
all
poets
dreams
not
a
but
has
its
hundred
species
of
plants
each
different
and
each
beautiful
and
when
you
tire
of
them
if
you
ever
can
tire
a
trip
into
the
meadows
by
the
thames
with
the
rich
vegetation
of
their
dikes
floating
of
every
hue
will
bring
you
as
it
were
into
a
new
world
new
forms
new
colours
new
delight
you
ask
why
this
is
and
you
find
yourself
at
once
involved
in
questions
of
soil
and
climate
which
lead
you
onward
step
by
step
into
the
deepest
problems
of
geology
and
chemistry
in
entomology
too
if
you
have
any
taste
for
the
beauties
of
form
and
colour
any
fondness
for
mechanical
and
dynamical
science
the
insects
even
to
the
smallest
will
supply
endless
food
for
such
likings
while
their
instincts
and
their
transformations
as
well
as
the
equally
wondrous
chemical
transformation
of
salts
and
gases
into
living
plants
which
agricultural
chemistry
teaches
you
will
tempt
you
to
echo
every
day
mephistopheles
magic
song
when
he
draws
wine
out
of
the
table
in
auersbach
cellar
wine
is
grapes
and
grapes
are
wood
the
wooden
board
yields
wine
as
good
it
is
but
a
deeper
glance
into
nature
countenance
all
is
plain
to
him
who
seeth
lift
the
veil
and
look
beneath
and
behold
the
wise
man
saith
miracles
if
you
have
faith
believe
me
you
need
not
go
so
far
to
find
more
than
you
will
ever
understand
an
hour
summer
walk
in
the
company
of
some
one
who
knows
what
to
look
for
and
how
to
look
for
it
by
the
side
of
one
of
those
stagnant
dikes
in
the
meadows
below
would
furnish
you
with
subjects
for
a
month
investigation
in
the
form
of
plants
shells
and
animalcules
on
each
of
which
a
whole
volume
might
be
written
and
even
at
this
seemingly
dead
season
of
the
year
fancy
not
that
nature
is
dead
not
even
that
she
sleeps
awhile
every
leaf
which
drops
from
the
bough
to
return
again
into
its
gases
and
its
dust
is
working
out
chemical
problems
which
have
puzzled
a
boyle
and
a
lavoisier
and
about
which
a
liebig
and
a
faraday
will
now
tell
you
that
they
have
but
some
dim
guess
and
that
they
stand
upon
the
threshold
of
knowledge
like
as
newton
said
of
himself
children
gathering
a
few
pebbles
upon
the
shore
of
an
illimitable
sea
in
every
woodland
too
innumerable
fungi
are
at
work
raising
from
the
lower
soil
rich
substances
which
strewed
on
the
surface
by
quick
decay
will
form
food
for
plants
higher
than
themselves
while
they
by
their
variety
and
beauty
both
of
form
and
colour
might
well
form
studies
for
any
painter
and
by
the
obscure
laws
of
their
reproduction
studies
for
any
philosopher
why
there
is
not
a
heap
of
dead
leaves
among
which
by
picking
it
through
carefully
you
might
not
find
some
twenty
species
of
delicate
and
elegant
hardly
a
at
which
among
the
moss
and
mould
you
might
not
find
the
chrysalides
of
beautiful
moths
where
caterpillars
have
crawled
down
the
trunk
in
autumn
to
lie
there
and
die
to
live
again
next
spring
in
a
new
and
fairer
shape
and
if
you
can
not
reach
even
there
go
to
the
in
the
nearest
yard
and
there
in
one
pinch
of
green
scum
in
one
spoonful
of
water
behold
a
whole
divina
commedia
of
living
forms
more
fantastic
a
thousand
times
than
those
with
which
dante
peopled
his
unseen
world
and
then
feel
as
you
should
feel
abashed
at
the
ignorance
and
weakness
of
mortal
man
abashed
still
more
at
that
rash
conceit
of
his
which
makes
him
fancy
himself
the
measure
of
all
things
and
say
with
me
oh
lord
thy
works
are
manifold
thy
ways
are
very
deep
in
wisdom
hast
thou
made
them
all
the
earth
is
full
of
thy
riches
thou
openest
thy
hand
and
fillest
all
things
living
with
plenteousness
they
continue
this
day
according
to
thine
ordinance
for
all
things
serve
thee
thou
hast
made
them
fast
for
ever
and
ever
thou
hast
given
them
a
law
which
shall
not
be
broken
let
them
praise
the
name
of
the
lord
for
he
spake
the
word
and
they
were
made
he
commanded
and
they
were
created
this
i
shall
say
but
little
more
than
this
on
the
religious
effect
of
the
study
of
natural
history
i
do
not
wish
to
preach
a
sermon
to
you
i
can
trust
god
world
to
bear
better
witness
than
i
can
of
the
loving
father
who
made
it
i
thank
him
from
my
own
experience
for
the
testimony
of
his
creation
only
next
to
the
testimony
of
his
bible
i
have
watched
scientific
discoveries
which
were
supposed
in
my
boyhood
to
be
contrary
to
revelation
found
out
one
by
one
to
confirm
and
explain
revelation
as
crude
and
hasty
theories
were
corrected
by
more
abundant
facts
and
men
saw
more
clearly
what
both
the
bible
and
nature
really
did
say
and
i
can
trust
that
the
same
process
will
go
on
for
ever
and
that
earth
and
god
word
will
never
contradict
each
other
i
have
found
the
average
of
scientific
men
not
less
but
more
godly
and
righteous
men
than
the
average
of
their
neighbours
and
i
can
trust
that
this
will
be
more
and
more
the
case
as
science
deepens
and
widens
and
therefore
i
can
trust
that
every
patient
truthful
and
healthful
mind
will
the
more
it
contemplates
the
works
of
god
echo
paul
great
declaration
that
the
invisible
things
of
god
are
clearly
seen
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
being
understood
by
the
things
which
are
made
even
his
eternal
power
and
godhead
and
so
trusting
i
pass
on
to
a
lower
view
of
the
subject
and
yet
not
an
unnecessary
one
in
an
industrial
country
like
this
the
practical
utility
of
any
study
must
needs
be
always
thrown
into
the
scale
and
natural
history
seems
at
first
sight
somewhat
unpractical
what
money
will
it
earn
for
a
man
in
after
life
is
a
question
which
will
be
asked
and
which
it
is
folly
to
despise
for
if
the
only
answer
be
none
at
all
a
man
has
a
right
to
rejoin
then
let
me
take
up
some
pursuit
which
will
train
and
refresh
my
mind
as
much
as
this
one
and
yet
be
of
pecuniary
benefit
to
me
some
day
if
you
can
find
such
a
study
by
all
means
follow
it
but
i
say
that
this
study
too
may
be
of
great
practical
benefit
in
after
life
how
much
money
have
i
young
as
i
am
seen
wasted
for
want
of
a
little
knowledge
of
botany
geology
or
chemistry
how
many
a
clever
man
becomes
the
dupe
of
empirics
for
want
of
a
little
science
how
many
a
mine
is
sought
for
where
no
mine
could
be
or
crop
attempted
to
be
grown
where
no
such
crop
could
grow
how
many
a
hidden
treasure
on
the
other
hand
do
men
walk
over
unheeding
how
many
a
new
material
how
many
an
improved
process
in
manufacture
is
possible
yet
is
passed
over
for
want
of
a
little
science
and
for
the
man
who
emigrates
and
comes
in
contact
with
rude
nature
teeming
with
unsuspected
wealth
of
what
incalculable
advantage
to
have
if
it
be
but
the
rudiments
of
those
sciences
which
will
tell
him
the
properties
and
therefore
the
value
of
the
plants
the
animals
the
minerals
the
climates
with
which
he
meets
true
natural
history
will
not
altogether
teach
him
about
these
things
because
most
of
them
must
needs
be
new
but
it
will
teach
him
to
compare
and
classify
them
as
he
finds
them
and
so
by
analogy
with
things
already
known
to
him
to
discover
their
intrinsic
worth
for
natural
history
stands
to
man
power
over
nature
that
is
to
his
power
of
being
useful
to
himself
and
to
mankind
in
the
same
relation
as
do
geography
grammar
arithmetic
geometry
political
economy
none
of
them
perhaps
bearing
directly
on
his
future
business
in
life
but
all
training
his
mind
for
his
business
all
giving
him
the
rudiments
of
laws
which
he
will
hereafter
work
out
and
apply
to
his
profession
and
even
at
home
be
sure
that
such
studies
will
bear
fruit
in
after
life
the
productive
wealth
of
england
is
not
exhausted
doubt
it
not
our
grandchildren
may
find
treasures
in
this
our
noble
island
of
which
we
never
dreamed
even
as
we
have
found
things
of
which
our
forefathers
dreamed
not
recollect
always
that
a
great
market
town
like
this
is
not
merely
a
commercial
centre
not
perhaps
even
a
commercial
centre
at
all
but
that
she
is
an
agricultural
centre
and
one
of
the
most
important
in
england
that
the
increase
of
science
here
will
be
sure
more
or
less
to
extend
itself
to
the
neighbourhood
and
then
lay
to
heart
this
one
fact
a
friend
of
mine
and
one
whom
i
am
proud
to
call
my
friend
succeeding
to
an
estate
thought
good
to
cultivate
it
himself
and
being
a
man
of
common
sense
he
thought
good
to
know
something
of
what
he
was
doing
and
he
said
to
himself
the
soil
and
the
rain
and
the
air
are
my
raw
materials
i
ought
surely
then
to
find
out
what
soil
and
rain
and
air
are
so
i
must
become
a
geologist
and
a
meteorologist
vegetable
substances
are
what
i
am
to
make
and
i
ought
surely
to
know
what
it
is
that
i
am
making
so
i
must
become
a
botanist
the
raw
material
does
somehow
or
other
become
manufactured
into
the
produce
the
soil
into
the
vegetable
i
ought
surely
to
know
a
little
about
the
processes
of
my
own
manufacture
so
i
must
learn
chemistry
chance
and
blind
custom
are
not
enough
for
me
at
best
they
can
but
leave
me
where
they
found
me
at
their
mercy
science
i
need
and
science
i
will
acquire
what
was
the
result
after
many
a
mistake
and
disappointment
he
succeeded
in
discovering
on
his
own
estate
a
mine
of
unsuspected
wealth
not
of
gold
indeed
but
of
gold
worth
the
elements
of
human
food
he
discovered
why
some
parts
of
his
estate
were
fertile
while
others
were
barren
and
by
applying
the
knowledge
thus
gained
he
converted
some
of
his
most
barren
fields
into
his
most
fertile
ones
he
preserved
again
and
again
his
crops
from
blight
while
those
of
others
perished
all
around
him
he
won
for
himself
wealth
and
the
respect
and
honour
of
men
of
science
while
those
around
him
slowly
opening
their
eyes
to
his
improvements
followed
his
lessons
at
till
the
whole
agriculture
of
an
important
district
has
become
gradually
but
permanently
improved
under
the
auspices
of
one
patient
and
brave
man
who
knew
that
knowledge
was
power
and
that
only
by
obeying
nature
can
man
conquer
her
bear
in
mind
both
these
last
great
proverbs
and
combine
them
in
your
mind
remember
that
while
england
is
and
ever
will
be
behindhand
in
metaphysical
and
scholastic
science
she
is
the
nation
which
above
all
others
has
conquered
nature
by
obeying
her
that
as
it
pleased
god
that
the
author
of
that
proverb
the
father
of
inductive
science
bacon
lord
verulam
should
have
been
an
englishman
so
it
has
pleased
him
that
we
lord
bacon
countrymen
should
improve
that
precious
heirloom
of
science
inventing
producing
exporting
importing
till
it
seems
as
if
the
whole
human
race
and
every
land
from
the
equator
to
the
pole
must
henceforth
bear
the
indelible
impress
and
sign
manual
of
english
science
and
bear
in
mind
as
i
said
just
now
that
this
study
of
natural
history
is
the
grammar
of
that
very
physical
science
which
has
enabled
england
thus
to
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
do
you
not
see
then
that
by
following
these
studies
you
are
walking
in
the
very
path
to
which
england
owes
her
wealth
that
you
are
training
in
yourselves
that
habit
of
mind
which
god
has
approved
as
the
one
which
he
has
ordained
for
englishmen
and
are
doing
what
in
you
lies
toward
carrying
out
in
after
life
the
glorious
work
which
god
seems
to
have
laid
on
the
english
race
to
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
one
word
more
and
i
have
done
unless
you
are
already
tired
of
hearing
me
i
would
suggest
a
few
practical
hints
before
we
part
the
best
way
of
learning
these
matters
is
by
classes
in
which
men
may
combine
and
interchange
their
thoughts
and
observations
the
greatest
savants
find
this
and
have
their
microscopic
society
linnaean
royal
geological
societies
british
associations
and
what
not
in
which
all
may
know
what
each
has
done
and
each
share
in
the
learning
of
all
for
as
iron
sharpeneth
iron
so
a
man
sharpens
the
face
of
his
friend
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
debating
societies
perhaps
it
was
my
own
fault
that
whenever
i
belonged
to
one
as
a
young
man
i
found
them
inclined
to
make
me
conceited
dictatorial
hasty
in
my
judgments
trying
to
state
a
case
before
i
had
investigated
it
to
teach
others
before
i
had
taught
myself
to
make
a
fine
speech
not
to
find
out
the
truth
till
in
i
think
a
wise
moment
for
me
i
vowed
at
twenty
never
to
set
foot
in
one
again
and
kept
my
vow
be
that
as
it
may
i
wish
that
side
by
side
with
the
debating
society
i
could
see
young
men
joining
in
natural
history
societies
going
out
in
company
on
pleasant
evenings
to
search
together
after
the
hidden
treasures
of
god
world
and
read
the
great
green
book
which
lies
open
alike
to
peasant
and
to
peer
and
then
meeting
say
once
a
week
to
debate
not
of
opinions
but
of
facts
to
show
each
what
they
had
found
to
classify
and
explain
to
learn
and
to
wonder
together
in
such
a
class
many
appliances
would
be
possible
a
microscope
for
instance
or
chemical
apparatus
might
belong
to
the
society
which
each
individual
by
himself
would
not
be
able
to
afford
while
as
for
books
books
on
these
subjects
are
now
published
at
a
marvellous
cheapness
which
puts
them
within
the
reach
of
every
one
and
of
an
excellence
which
twenty
years
ago
was
impossible
any
working
man
in
this
town
might
now
especially
in
a
class
consult
scientific
books
for
which
i
as
a
lad
twenty
years
ago
was
sighing
in
vain
nay
many
of
which
twenty
years
ago
the
richest
nobleman
could
not
have
purchased
for
the
simple
reason
that
dear
or
cheap
they
did
not
exist
such
classes
too
would
be
the
easiest
cheapest
and
pleasantest
way
of
establishing
what
ought
to
exist
i
think
in
connection
with
every
institution
like
this
namely
a
museum
if
the
young
men
were
really
ready
and
willing
to
collect
objects
of
interest
i
doubt
not
that
men
would
be
found
who
would
undertake
the
expense
of
mounting
them
in
a
museum
and
you
can
not
imagine
i
assure
you
how
large
and
how
interesting
a
museum
might
be
formed
of
the
natural
curiosities
of
a
neighbourhood
like
this
i
may
say
indeed
of
any
neighbourhood
or
of
any
parish
but
your
museum
need
not
be
confined
to
the
neighbourhood
societies
now
exist
in
every
part
of
england
who
will
be
happy
to
exchange
their
duplicates
for
yours
as
your
collection
increased
in
importance
old
members
abroad
would
gladly
contribute
foreign
curiosities
to
your
stock
neighbouring
gentlemen
would
send
you
valuable
objects
which
had
been
lumbering
their
houses
uncared
for
because
they
stood
alone
and
formed
no
part
of
a
collection
and
i
for
one
would
be
happy
to
add
something
from
the
fauna
and
flora
of
those
moorlands
where
i
have
so
long
enjoyed
the
wonders
of
nature
never
i
can
honestly
say
alone
because
when
man
was
not
with
me
i
had
companions
in
every
bee
and
flower
and
pebble
and
never
idle
because
i
could
not
pass
a
swamp
or
a
tuft
of
heather
without
finding
in
it
a
fairy
tale
of
which
i
could
but
decipher
here
and
there
a
line
or
two
and
yet
found
them
more
interesting
than
all
the
books
save
one
which
were
ever
written
upon
earth
the
natural
theology
of
the
future
read
at
sion
college
january
when
i
accepted
the
unexpected
and
undeserved
honour
of
being
allowed
to
lecture
here
the
first
subject
which
suggested
itself
to
me
was
natural
theology
it
is
one
which
has
taken
up
much
of
my
thought
for
some
years
past
which
seems
to
me
more
and
more
important
and
which
is
just
now
somewhat
forgotten
i
therefore
determined
to
say
a
few
words
on
it
i
do
not
pretend
to
teach
but
only
to
suggest
to
point
out
certain
problems
of
natural
theology
the
further
solution
of
which
ought
i
think
to
be
soon
attempted
i
wish
to
speak
remember
not
on
natural
religion
but
on
natural
theology
by
the
first
i
understand
what
can
be
learned
from
the
physical
universe
of
man
duty
to
god
and
to
his
neighbour
by
the
latter
i
understand
what
can
be
learned
concerning
god
himself
of
natural
religion
i
shall
say
nothing
i
do
not
even
affirm
that
a
natural
religion
is
possible
but
i
do
very
earnestly
believe
that
a
natural
theology
is
possible
and
i
earnestly
believe
also
that
it
is
most
important
that
natural
theology
should
in
every
age
keep
pace
with
doctrinal
or
ecclesiastical
theology
bishop
butler
certainly
held
this
belief
his
analogy
of
religion
natural
and
revealed
to
the
constitution
and
course
of
nature
a
book
for
which
i
entertain
the
most
profound
respect
is
based
on
a
belief
that
the
god
of
nature
and
the
god
of
grace
are
one
and
that
therefore
the
god
who
satisfies
our
conscience
ought
more
or
less
to
satisfy
our
reason
also
to
teach
that
was
mission
and
he
fulfilled
it
well
but
it
is
a
mission
which
has
to
be
again
and
again
as
human
thought
changes
and
human
science
develops
for
if
in
any
age
or
country
the
god
who
seems
to
be
revealed
by
nature
seems
different
from
the
god
who
is
revealed
by
the
then
popular
religion
then
that
god
and
the
religion
which
tells
of
that
god
will
gradually
cease
to
be
believed
in
for
the
demands
of
reason
as
none
knew
better
than
good
bishop
butler
must
be
and
ought
to
be
satisfied
and
when
a
popular
war
arises
between
the
reason
of
a
generation
and
its
theology
it
behoves
the
ministers
of
religion
to
inquire
with
all
humility
and
godly
fear
on
which
side
lies
the
fault
whether
the
theology
which
they
expound
is
all
that
it
should
be
or
whether
the
reason
of
those
who
impugn
it
is
all
that
it
should
be
for
me
as
i
trust
an
orthodox
priest
of
the
church
of
england
i
believe
the
theology
of
the
national
church
of
england
as
by
law
established
to
be
eminently
rational
as
well
as
scriptural
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
to
me
that
the
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
since
the
foundation
of
the
royal
society
in
the
seventeenth
century
have
done
more
for
sound
physical
science
than
the
clergy
of
any
other
denomination
or
that
the
three
greatest
natural
theologians
with
which
i
at
least
am
acquainted
berkeley
butler
and
paley
should
have
belonged
to
our
church
i
am
not
unaware
of
what
the
germans
of
the
eighteenth
century
have
done
i
consider
goethe
claims
to
have
advanced
natural
theology
very
much
but
i
do
recommend
to
young
clergymen
outlines
of
the
philosophy
of
the
history
of
man
as
a
book
in
spite
of
certain
defects
full
of
sound
and
precious
wisdom
but
it
seems
to
me
that
english
natural
theology
in
the
eighteenth
century
stood
more
secure
than
that
of
any
other
nation
on
the
foundation
which
berkeley
butler
and
paley
had
laid
and
that
if
our
orthodox
thinkers
for
the
last
hundred
years
had
followed
steadily
in
their
steps
we
should
not
be
deploring
now
a
wide
and
as
some
think
increasing
divorce
between
science
and
christianity
but
it
was
not
so
to
be
the
impulse
given
by
wesley
and
whitfield
turned
and
not
before
it
was
needed
the
earnest
mind
of
england
almost
exclusively
to
questions
of
personal
religion
and
that
impulse
under
many
unexpected
forms
has
continued
ever
since
i
only
state
the
fact
i
do
not
deplore
it
god
forbid
wisdom
is
justified
of
all
her
children
and
as
according
to
the
wise
american
it
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
world
so
it
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
living
church
but
that
the
religious
temper
of
england
for
the
last
two
or
three
generations
has
been
unfavourable
to
a
sound
and
scientific
development
of
natural
theology
there
can
be
no
doubt
we
have
only
if
we
need
proof
to
look
at
the
hymns
many
of
them
very
pure
pious
and
beautiful
which
are
used
at
this
day
in
churches
and
chapels
by
persons
of
every
shade
of
opinion
how
often
is
the
tone
in
which
they
speak
of
the
natural
world
one
of
dissatisfaction
distrust
almost
contempt
disease
decay
and
death
around
i
see
is
their
rather
than
o
all
ye
works
of
the
lord
bless
him
praise
him
and
magnify
him
together
there
lingers
about
them
a
savour
of
the
old
monastic
theory
that
this
earth
is
the
devil
planet
fallen
accursed
needing
to
be
exorcised
at
every
turn
before
it
is
useful
or
even
safe
for
man
an
age
which
has
adopted
as
its
most
popular
hymn
a
paraphrase
of
the
mediaeval
monk
hic
breve
vivitur
and
in
which
stalwart
boys
are
bidden
in
their
chapel
worship
to
tell
the
almighty
god
of
truth
that
they
lie
awake
weeping
at
night
for
joy
at
the
thought
that
they
will
die
and
see
jerusalem
the
golden
is
doubtless
a
pious
and
devout
age
but
not
at
least
as
yet
an
age
in
which
natural
theology
is
likely
to
attain
a
high
a
healthy
or
a
scriptural
development
not
a
scriptural
development
let
me
press
on
you
my
clerical
brethren
most
earnestly
this
one
point
it
is
time
that
we
should
make
up
our
minds
what
tone
scripture
does
take
toward
nature
natural
science
natural
theology
most
of
you
i
doubt
not
have
made
up
your
minds
already
and
in
consequence
have
no
fear
of
natural
science
no
fear
for
natural
theology
but
i
can
not
deny
that
i
find
still
lingering
here
and
there
certain
of
the
old
views
of
nature
of
which
i
used
to
hear
but
too
much
here
in
london
some
years
ago
not
from
my
own
father
thank
god
for
he
to
his
honour
was
one
of
those
few
london
clergy
who
then
faced
and
defended
advanced
physical
science
but
from
others
better
men
too
than
i
shall
ever
hope
to
be
who
used
to
consider
natural
theology
as
useless
fallacious
impossible
on
the
ground
that
this
earth
did
not
reveal
the
will
and
character
of
god
because
it
was
cursed
and
fallen
and
that
its
facts
in
consequence
were
not
to
be
respected
or
relied
on
this
i
was
told
was
the
doctrine
of
scripture
and
was
therefore
true
but
when
longing
to
reconcile
my
conscience
and
my
reason
on
a
question
so
awful
to
a
young
student
of
natural
science
i
went
to
my
bible
what
did
i
find
no
word
of
all
this
much
thank
god
i
may
say
one
continuous
undercurrent
of
the
very
opposite
of
all
this
i
pray
you
bear
with
me
even
though
i
may
seem
impertinent
but
what
do
we
find
in
the
bible
with
the
exception
of
that
first
curse
that
remember
can
not
mean
any
alteration
in
the
laws
of
nature
by
which
labour
should
only
produce
for
him
henceforth
thorns
and
thistles
for
in
the
first
place
any
such
curse
is
formally
abrogated
in
the
eighth
chapter
and
verse
of
the
very
same
document
i
will
not
again
curse
the
earth
any
more
for
man
sake
while
the
earth
remaineth
and
harvest
cold
and
heat
summer
and
winter
day
and
night
shall
not
cease
and
next
the
fact
is
not
so
for
if
you
root
up
the
thorns
and
thistles
and
keep
your
land
clean
then
assuredly
you
will
grow
and
not
thorns
wheat
and
not
thistles
according
to
those
laws
of
nature
which
are
the
voice
of
god
expressed
in
facts
and
yet
the
words
are
true
there
is
a
curse
upon
the
earth
though
not
one
which
by
altering
the
laws
of
nature
has
made
natural
facts
untrustworthy
there
is
a
curse
on
the
earth
such
a
curse
as
is
expressed
i
believe
in
the
old
hebrew
text
where
the
word
adamah
correctly
translated
in
our
version
the
ground
signifies
as
i
am
told
not
this
planet
but
simply
the
soil
from
whence
we
get
our
food
such
a
curse
as
certainly
is
expressed
by
the
septuagint
and
the
vulgate
versions
cursed
is
the
earth
greek
in
opere
tuo
as
the
vulgate
has
it
in
thy
works
man
work
is
too
often
the
curse
of
the
very
planet
which
he
misuses
none
should
know
that
better
than
the
botanist
who
sees
whole
regions
desolate
and
given
up
to
sterility
and
literal
thorns
and
thistles
on
account
of
man
sin
and
folly
ignorance
and
greedy
waste
well
said
that
veteran
botanist
the
venerable
elias
fries
of
lund
a
broad
band
of
waste
land
follows
gradually
in
the
steps
of
cultivation
if
it
expands
its
centre
and
its
cradle
dies
and
on
the
outer
borders
only
do
we
find
green
shoots
but
it
is
not
impossible
only
difficult
for
man
without
renouncing
the
advantage
of
culture
itself
one
day
to
make
reparation
for
the
injury
which
he
has
inflicted
he
is
appointed
lord
of
creation
true
it
is
that
thorns
and
thistles
and
poisonous
plants
well
named
by
botanists
rubbish
plants
mark
the
track
which
man
has
proudly
traversed
through
the
earth
before
him
lay
original
nature
in
her
wild
but
sublime
beauty
behind
him
he
leaves
the
desert
a
deformed
and
ruined
land
for
childish
desire
of
destruction
or
thoughtless
squandering
of
vegetable
treasures
has
destroyed
the
character
of
nature
and
terrified
man
himself
flies
from
the
arena
of
his
actions
leaving
the
impoverished
earth
to
barbarous
races
or
to
animals
so
long
as
yet
another
spot
in
virgin
beauty
smiles
before
him
here
again
in
selfish
pursuit
of
profit
and
consciously
or
unconsciously
following
the
abominable
principle
of
the
great
moral
vileness
which
one
man
has
expressed
nous
le
deluge
he
begins
anew
the
work
of
destruction
thus
did
cultivation
driven
out
leave
the
east
and
perhaps
the
deserts
formerly
robbed
of
their
coverings
like
the
wild
hordes
of
old
over
beautiful
greece
thus
rolls
this
conquest
with
fearful
rapidity
from
east
to
west
through
america
and
the
planter
now
often
leaves
the
already
exhausted
land
and
the
eastern
climate
become
infertile
through
the
demolition
of
the
forests
to
introduce
a
similar
revolution
into
the
far
west
as
we
proceed
we
find
nothing
in
the
general
tone
of
scripture
which
can
hinder
our
natural
theology
being
at
once
scriptural
and
scientific
if
it
is
to
be
scientific
it
must
begin
by
approaching
nature
at
once
with
a
cheerful
and
reverent
spirit
as
a
noble
healthy
and
trustworthy
thing
and
what
is
that
save
the
spirit
of
those
who
wrote
the
and
psalms
the
spirit
too
of
him
who
wrote
that
song
of
the
three
children
which
is
as
it
were
the
flower
and
crown
of
the
old
testament
the
summing
up
of
all
that
is
most
true
and
eternal
in
the
old
jewish
faith
and
which
as
long
as
it
is
sung
in
our
churches
is
the
charter
and
of
all
christian
students
of
those
works
of
the
lord
which
it
calls
on
to
bless
him
praise
him
and
magnify
him
for
ever
what
next
will
be
demanded
of
us
by
physical
science
belief
certainly
just
now
in
the
permanence
of
natural
laws
why
that
is
taken
for
granted
i
hold
throughout
the
bible
i
can
not
see
how
our
lord
parables
drawn
from
the
birds
and
the
flowers
the
seasons
and
the
weather
have
any
logical
weight
or
can
be
considered
as
aught
but
capricious
and
fanciful
illustrations
which
god
forbid
unless
we
look
at
them
as
instances
of
laws
of
the
natural
world
which
find
their
analogues
in
the
laws
of
the
spiritual
world
the
kingdom
of
god
i
can
not
conceive
a
writing
that
psalm
who
had
not
the
most
deep
the
most
earnest
sense
of
the
permanence
of
natural
law
but
more
the
fact
is
expressly
asserted
again
and
again
they
continue
this
day
according
to
thine
ordinance
for
all
things
serve
thee
thou
hast
made
them
fast
for
ever
and
ever
thou
hast
given
them
a
law
which
shall
not
be
broken
let
us
pass
on
gentlemen
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
about
this
matter
but
next
it
will
be
demanded
of
us
that
natural
theology
shall
set
forth
a
god
whose
character
is
consistent
with
all
the
facts
of
nature
and
not
only
with
those
which
are
pleasant
and
beautiful
that
challenge
was
accepted
and
i
think
victoriously
by
bishop
butler
as
far
as
the
christian
religion
is
concerned
as
far
as
the
scripture
is
concerned
we
may
answer
thus
it
is
said
to
us
i
know
that
it
is
said
you
tell
us
of
a
god
of
love
a
god
of
flowers
and
sunshine
of
singing
birds
and
little
children
but
there
are
more
facts
in
nature
than
these
there
is
premature
death
pestilence
famine
and
if
you
answer
man
has
control
over
these
they
are
caused
by
man
ignorance
and
sin
and
by
his
breaking
of
natural
laws
what
will
you
make
of
those
destructive
powers
over
which
he
has
no
control
of
the
hurricane
and
the
earthquake
of
poisons
vegetable
and
mineral
of
those
parasitic
entozoa
whose
awful
abundance
and
awful
destructiveness
in
man
and
beast
science
is
just
revealing
a
new
page
of
danger
and
loathsomeness
how
does
that
suit
your
conception
of
a
god
of
love
we
can
answer
whether
or
not
it
suits
our
conception
of
a
god
of
love
it
suits
scripture
conception
of
him
for
nothing
is
more
clear
nay
is
it
not
urged
again
and
again
as
a
blot
on
scripture
that
it
reveals
a
god
not
merely
of
love
but
of
sternness
a
god
in
whose
eyes
physical
pain
is
not
the
worst
of
evils
nor
animal
life
too
often
miscalled
human
life
the
most
precious
of
objects
a
god
who
destroys
when
it
seems
fit
to
him
and
that
wholesale
and
seemingly
without
either
pity
or
discrimination
man
woman
and
child
visiting
the
sins
of
the
fathers
on
the
children
making
the
land
empty
and
bare
and
destroying
from
off
it
man
and
beast
this
is
the
god
of
the
old
testament
and
if
any
say
as
is
often
too
rashly
said
this
is
not
the
god
of
the
new
i
answer
but
have
you
read
your
new
testament
have
you
read
the
latter
chapters
of
matthew
have
you
read
the
opening
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
have
you
read
the
book
of
revelations
if
so
will
you
say
that
the
god
of
the
new
testament
is
compared
with
the
god
of
the
old
less
awful
less
destructive
and
therefore
less
like
the
being
granting
always
that
there
is
such
a
being
who
presides
over
nature
and
her
destructive
powers
it
is
an
awful
problem
but
the
writers
of
the
bible
have
faced
it
valiantly
physical
science
is
facing
it
valiantly
now
therefore
natural
theology
may
face
it
likewise
remember
great
words
about
poor
francesca
in
the
inferno
infinite
pity
yet
also
infinite
rigour
of
law
it
is
so
nature
is
made
it
is
so
dante
discerned
that
she
was
made
there
are
two
other
points
on
which
i
must
beg
leave
to
say
a
few
words
physical
science
will
demand
of
our
natural
theologians
that
they
should
be
aware
of
their
importance
and
let
as
matthew
arnold
would
say
their
thoughts
play
freely
round
them
i
mean
questions
of
embryology
and
questions
of
race
on
the
first
there
may
be
much
to
be
said
which
is
for
the
present
best
left
unsaid
even
here
i
only
ask
you
to
recollect
how
often
in
scripture
those
two
plain
old
words
beget
and
bring
forth
occur
and
in
what
important
passages
and
i
ask
you
to
remember
that
marvellous
essay
on
natural
theology
if
i
may
so
call
it
in
all
reverence
the
psalm
and
judge
for
yourself
whether
he
who
wrote
that
did
not
consider
the
study
of
embryology
as
important
as
significant
as
worthy
of
his
deepest
attention
as
an
owen
a
huxley
or
a
darwin
nay
i
will
go
farther
still
and
say
that
in
those
great
words
thine
eyes
did
see
my
substance
yet
being
imperfect
and
in
thy
book
all
my
members
were
written
which
in
continuance
were
fashioned
when
as
yet
there
was
none
of
them
those
words
i
say
the
psalmist
has
anticipated
that
realistic
view
of
embryological
questions
to
which
our
most
modern
philosophers
are
it
seems
to
me
slowly
half
unconsciously
but
still
inevitably
returning
next
as
to
race
some
persons
now
have
a
nervous
fear
of
that
word
and
of
allowing
any
importance
to
difference
of
races
some
dislike
it
because
they
think
that
it
endangers
the
modern
notions
of
democratic
equality
others
because
they
fear
that
it
may
be
proved
that
the
negro
is
not
a
man
and
a
brother
i
think
the
fears
of
both
parties
groundless
as
for
the
negro
i
not
only
believe
him
to
be
of
the
same
race
as
myself
but
that
if
theories
are
true
science
has
proved
that
he
must
be
such
i
should
have
thought
as
a
humble
student
of
such
questions
that
the
one
fact
of
the
unique
distribution
of
the
hair
in
all
races
of
human
beings
was
full
moral
proof
that
they
had
all
had
one
common
ancestor
but
this
is
not
matter
of
natural
theology
what
is
matter
thereof
is
this
physical
science
is
proving
more
and
more
the
immense
importance
of
race
the
importance
of
hereditary
powers
hereditary
organs
hereditary
habits
in
all
organised
beings
from
the
lowest
plant
to
the
highest
animal
she
is
proving
more
and
more
the
omnipresent
action
of
the
differences
between
races
how
the
more
favoured
race
she
can
not
avoid
using
the
epithet
exterminates
the
less
favoured
or
at
least
expels
it
and
forces
it
under
penalty
of
death
to
adapt
itself
to
new
circumstances
and
in
a
word
that
competition
between
every
race
and
every
individual
of
that
race
and
reward
according
to
deserts
is
as
far
as
we
can
see
an
universal
law
of
living
things
and
she
says
for
the
facts
of
history
prove
it
that
as
it
is
among
the
races
of
plants
and
animals
so
it
has
been
unto
this
day
among
the
races
of
men
the
natural
theology
of
the
future
must
take
count
of
these
tremendous
and
even
painful
facts
and
she
may
take
count
of
them
for
scripture
has
taken
count
of
them
already
it
talks
continually
it
has
been
blamed
for
talking
so
much
of
races
of
families
of
their
wars
their
struggles
their
exterminations
of
races
favoured
of
races
rejected
of
remnants
being
saved
to
continue
the
race
of
hereditary
tendencies
hereditary
excellences
hereditary
guilt
its
sense
of
the
reality
and
importance
of
descent
is
so
intense
that
it
speaks
of
a
whole
tribe
or
a
whole
family
by
the
name
of
its
common
ancestor
and
the
whole
nation
of
the
jews
is
israel
to
the
end
and
if
i
be
told
this
is
true
of
the
old
testament
but
not
of
the
new
i
must
answer
what
does
not
paul
hold
the
identity
of
the
whole
jewish
race
with
israel
their
forefather
as
strongly
as
any
prophet
of
the
old
testament
and
what
is
the
central
historic
fact
save
one
of
the
new
testament
but
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
the
dispersion
all
but
destruction
of
a
race
not
by
miracle
but
by
invasion
because
found
wanting
when
weighed
in
the
stern
balances
of
natural
and
social
law
gentlemen
think
of
this
i
only
suggest
the
thought
but
i
do
not
suggest
it
in
haste
think
over
it
by
the
light
which
our
parables
his
analogies
between
the
physical
and
social
constitution
of
the
world
afford
and
consider
whether
those
awful
words
fulfilled
then
and
fulfilled
so
often
since
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
be
taken
from
you
and
given
to
a
nation
bringing
forth
the
fruits
hereof
may
not
be
the
supreme
instance
the
most
complex
development
of
a
law
which
runs
through
all
created
things
down
to
the
moss
which
struggles
for
existence
on
the
rock
do
i
say
that
this
is
all
that
man
is
merely
a
part
of
nature
the
puppet
of
circumstances
and
hereditary
tendencies
that
brute
competition
is
the
one
law
of
his
life
that
he
is
doomed
for
ever
to
be
the
slave
of
his
own
needs
enforced
by
an
internecine
struggle
for
existence
god
forbid
i
believe
not
only
in
nature
but
in
grace
i
believe
that
this
is
man
fate
only
as
long
as
he
sows
to
the
flesh
and
of
the
flesh
reaps
corruption
i
believe
that
if
he
will
strive
upward
working
out
the
beast
and
let
the
ape
and
tiger
die
if
he
will
be
even
as
wise
as
the
social
animals
as
the
ant
and
the
bee
who
have
risen
if
not
to
the
virtue
of
charity
at
least
to
the
virtues
of
and
patriotism
then
he
will
rise
towards
a
higher
sphere
toward
that
kingdom
of
god
of
which
it
is
written
he
that
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
god
and
god
in
him
whether
that
be
matter
of
natural
theology
i
can
not
tell
as
yet
but
as
for
all
the
former
questions
all
that
paul
means
when
he
talks
of
the
law
and
how
the
works
of
the
flesh
bring
men
under
the
law
stern
and
terrible
and
destructive
though
holy
and
just
and
good
they
are
matter
of
natural
theology
and
i
believe
that
on
them
as
elsewhere
scripture
and
science
will
be
ultimately
found
to
coincide
but
here
we
have
to
face
an
objection
which
you
will
often
hear
now
from
scientific
men
and
still
oftener
from
men
who
will
say
it
matters
not
to
us
whether
scripture
contradicts
or
does
not
contradict
a
scientific
natural
theology
for
we
hold
such
a
science
to
be
impossible
and
naught
the
old
jews
put
a
god
into
nature
and
therefore
of
course
they
could
see
as
you
see
what
they
had
already
put
there
but
we
see
no
god
in
nature
we
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
a
god
we
merely
say
that
scientific
research
does
not
reveal
him
to
us
we
see
no
marks
of
design
in
physical
phenomena
what
used
to
be
considered
as
marks
of
design
can
be
better
explained
by
considering
them
as
the
results
of
evolution
according
to
necessary
laws
and
you
and
scripture
make
a
mere
assumption
when
you
ascribe
them
to
the
operation
of
a
mind
like
the
human
mind
now
on
this
point
i
believe
we
may
answer
fearlessly
if
you
can
not
see
it
we
can
not
help
you
if
the
heavens
do
not
declare
to
you
the
glory
of
god
nor
the
firmament
show
you
his
then
our
poor
arguments
about
them
will
not
show
it
the
eye
can
only
see
that
which
it
brings
with
it
the
power
of
seeing
we
can
only
reassert
that
we
see
design
everywhere
and
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
human
race
in
every
age
and
clime
has
seen
it
analogy
from
experience
sound
induction
as
we
hold
from
the
works
not
only
of
men
but
of
animals
has
made
it
an
all
but
truth
to
us
that
wherever
there
is
arrangement
there
must
be
an
arranger
wherever
there
is
adaptation
of
means
to
an
end
there
must
be
an
adapter
wherever
an
organisation
there
must
be
an
organiser
the
existence
of
a
designing
god
is
no
more
demonstrable
from
nature
than
the
existence
of
other
human
beings
independent
of
ourselves
or
indeed
the
existence
of
our
own
bodies
but
like
the
belief
in
them
the
belief
in
him
has
become
an
article
of
our
common
sense
and
that
this
designing
mind
is
in
some
respects
similar
to
the
human
mind
is
proved
to
us
as
sir
john
herschel
well
puts
it
by
the
mere
fact
that
we
can
discover
and
comprehend
the
processes
of
nature
but
here
again
if
we
be
contradicted
we
can
only
reassert
if
the
old
words
he
that
made
the
eye
shall
he
not
see
he
that
planted
the
ear
shall
he
not
hear
do
not
at
once
commend
themselves
to
the
intellect
of
any
person
we
shall
never
convince
that
person
by
any
arguments
drawn
from
the
absurdity
of
conceiving
the
invention
of
optics
by
a
blind
race
or
of
music
by
a
deaf
one
so
we
will
assert
our
own
notion
boldly
and
more
we
will
say
in
spite
of
ridicule
that
if
such
a
god
exists
final
causes
must
exist
also
that
the
whole
universe
must
be
one
chain
of
final
causes
that
if
there
be
a
supreme
reason
he
must
have
a
reason
and
that
a
good
reason
for
every
physical
phenomenon
we
will
tell
the
modern
scientific
man
you
are
nervously
afraid
of
the
mention
of
final
causes
you
quote
against
them
bacon
saying
that
they
are
barren
virgins
that
no
physical
fact
was
ever
discovered
or
explained
by
them
you
are
right
as
far
as
regards
yourselves
you
have
no
business
with
final
causes
because
final
causes
are
moral
causes
and
you
are
physical
students
only
we
the
natural
theologians
have
business
with
them
your
duty
is
to
find
out
the
how
of
things
ours
to
find
out
the
why
if
you
rejoin
that
we
shall
never
find
out
the
why
unless
we
first
learn
something
of
the
how
we
shall
not
deny
that
it
may
be
most
useful
i
had
almost
said
necessary
that
the
clergy
should
have
some
scientific
training
it
may
be
most
useful
i
sometimes
dream
of
a
day
when
it
will
be
considered
necessary
that
every
candidate
for
ordination
should
be
required
to
have
passed
creditably
in
at
least
one
branch
of
physical
science
if
it
be
only
to
teach
him
the
method
of
sound
scientific
thought
but
our
having
learnt
the
how
will
not
make
it
needless
much
less
impossible
for
us
to
study
the
why
it
will
merely
make
more
clear
to
us
the
things
of
which
we
have
to
study
the
why
and
enable
us
to
keep
the
how
and
the
why
more
religiously
apart
from
each
other
but
if
it
be
said
after
all
there
is
no
why
the
doctrine
of
evolution
by
doing
away
with
the
theory
of
creation
does
away
with
that
of
final
causes
let
us
answer
boldly
not
in
the
least
we
might
accept
all
that
darwin
all
that
professor
huxley
has
so
learnedly
and
so
acutely
written
on
physical
science
and
yet
preserve
our
natural
theology
on
exactly
the
same
basis
as
that
on
which
butler
and
paley
left
it
that
we
should
have
to
develop
it
i
do
not
deny
that
we
should
have
to
relinquish
it
i
do
let
me
press
this
thought
earnestly
on
you
i
know
that
many
wiser
and
better
men
than
i
have
fears
on
this
point
i
can
not
share
in
them
all
it
seems
to
me
that
the
new
doctrines
of
evolution
demand
is
this
we
all
agree
for
the
fact
is
patent
that
our
own
bodies
and
indeed
the
body
of
every
living
creature
are
evolved
from
a
seemingly
simple
germ
by
natural
laws
without
visible
action
of
any
designing
will
or
mind
into
the
full
organisation
of
a
human
or
other
creature
yet
we
do
not
say
on
that
account
god
did
not
create
me
i
only
grew
we
hold
in
this
case
to
our
old
idea
and
say
if
there
be
evolution
there
must
be
an
evolver
now
the
new
physical
theories
only
ask
us
it
seems
to
me
to
extend
this
conception
to
the
whole
universe
to
believe
that
not
individuals
merely
but
whole
varieties
and
races
the
total
organised
life
on
this
planet
and
it
may
be
the
total
organisation
of
the
universe
have
been
evolved
just
as
our
bodies
are
by
natural
laws
acting
through
circumstance
this
may
be
true
or
may
be
false
but
all
its
truth
can
do
to
the
natural
theologian
will
be
to
make
him
believe
that
the
creator
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
whole
universe
as
that
creator
undeniably
bears
to
every
individual
human
body
i
entreat
you
to
weigh
these
words
which
have
not
been
written
in
haste
and
i
entreat
you
also
if
you
wish
to
see
how
little
the
new
theory
that
species
may
have
been
gradually
created
by
variation
natural
selection
and
so
forth
interferes
with
the
old
theory
of
design
contrivance
and
adaptation
nay
with
the
fullest
admission
of
benevolent
final
causes
i
entreat
you
i
say
to
study
fertilisation
of
orchids
a
book
which
whether
his
main
theory
be
true
or
not
will
still
remain
a
most
valuable
addition
to
natural
theology
for
suppose
gentlemen
that
all
the
species
of
orchids
and
not
only
they
but
their
congeners
the
gingers
the
arrowroots
the
bananas
are
all
the
descendants
of
one
original
form
which
was
most
probably
nearly
allied
to
the
snowdrop
and
the
iris
what
then
would
that
be
one
whit
more
wonderful
more
unworthy
of
the
wisdom
and
power
of
god
than
if
they
were
as
most
believe
created
each
and
all
at
once
with
their
minute
and
often
imaginary
shades
of
difference
what
would
the
natural
theologian
have
to
say
were
the
first
theory
true
save
that
god
works
are
even
more
wonderful
than
he
always
believed
them
to
be
as
for
the
theory
being
impossible
we
must
leave
the
discussion
of
that
to
physical
students
it
is
not
for
us
clergymen
to
limit
the
power
of
god
is
anything
too
hard
for
the
lord
asked
the
prophet
of
old
and
we
have
a
right
to
ask
it
as
long
as
time
shall
last
if
it
be
said
that
natural
selection
is
too
simple
a
cause
to
produce
such
fantastic
variety
that
again
is
a
question
to
be
settled
exclusively
by
physical
students
all
we
have
to
say
on
the
matter
is
that
we
always
knew
that
god
works
by
very
simple
or
seemingly
simple
means
that
the
whole
universe
as
far
as
we
could
discern
it
was
one
concatenation
of
the
most
simple
means
that
it
was
wonderful
yea
miraculous
in
our
eyes
that
a
child
should
resemble
its
parents
that
the
raindrops
should
make
the
grass
grow
that
the
grass
should
become
flesh
and
the
flesh
sustenance
for
the
thinking
brain
of
man
ought
god
to
seem
less
or
more
august
in
our
eyes
when
we
are
told
that
his
means
are
even
more
simple
than
we
supposed
we
held
him
to
be
almighty
and
allwise
are
we
to
reverence
him
less
or
more
if
we
hear
that
his
might
is
greater
his
wisdom
deeper
than
we
ever
dreamed
we
believed
that
his
care
was
over
all
his
works
that
his
providence
watched
perpetually
over
the
whole
universe
we
were
taught
some
of
us
at
least
by
holy
scripture
to
believe
that
the
whole
history
of
the
universe
was
made
up
of
special
providences
if
then
that
should
be
true
which
darwin
writes
it
may
be
metaphorically
said
that
natural
selection
is
daily
and
hourly
scrutinising
throughout
the
world
every
variation
even
the
slightest
rejecting
that
which
is
bad
preserving
and
adding
up
that
which
is
good
silently
and
incessantly
working
whenever
and
wherever
opportunity
offers
at
the
improvement
of
every
organic
being
if
that
i
say
were
proven
to
be
true
ought
god
care
and
god
providence
to
seem
less
or
more
magnificent
in
our
eyes
of
old
it
was
said
by
him
without
whom
nothing
is
made
my
father
worketh
hitherto
and
i
work
shall
we
quarrel
with
science
if
she
should
show
how
those
words
are
true
what
in
one
word
should
we
have
to
say
but
this
we
knew
of
old
that
god
was
so
wise
that
he
could
make
all
things
but
behold
he
is
so
much
wiser
than
even
that
that
he
can
make
all
things
make
themselves
but
it
may
be
said
these
notions
are
contrary
to
scripture
i
must
beg
very
humbly
but
very
firmly
to
demur
to
that
opinion
scripture
says
that
god
created
but
it
nowhere
defines
that
term
the
means
the
how
of
creation
is
nowhere
specified
scripture
again
says
that
organised
beings
were
produced
each
according
to
their
kind
but
it
nowhere
defines
that
term
what
a
kind
includes
whether
it
includes
or
not
the
capacity
of
varying
which
is
just
the
question
in
point
is
nowhere
specified
and
i
think
it
a
most
important
rule
in
scriptural
exegesis
to
be
most
cautious
as
to
limiting
the
meaning
of
any
term
which
scripture
itself
has
not
limited
lest
we
find
ourselves
putting
into
the
teaching
of
scripture
our
own
human
theories
or
prejudices
and
consider
is
not
man
a
kind
and
has
not
mankind
varied
physically
intellectually
spiritually
is
not
the
bible
from
beginning
to
end
a
history
of
the
variations
of
mankind
for
worse
or
for
better
from
their
original
type
let
us
rather
look
with
calmness
and
even
with
hope
and
good
will
on
these
new
theories
for
correct
or
incorrect
they
surely
mark
a
tendency
toward
a
more
not
a
less
scriptural
view
of
nature
are
they
not
attempts
whether
successful
or
unsuccessful
to
escape
from
that
shallow
mechanical
notion
of
the
universe
and
its
creator
which
was
too
much
in
vogue
in
the
eighteenth
century
among
divines
as
well
as
philosophers
the
theory
which
goethe
to
do
him
justice
and
after
him
thomas
carlyle
have
treated
with
such
noble
scorn
the
theory
i
mean
that
god
has
wound
up
the
universe
like
a
clock
and
left
it
to
tick
by
itself
till
it
runs
down
never
troubling
himself
with
it
save
possibly
for
even
that
was
only
half
believed
by
rare
miraculous
interferences
with
the
laws
which
he
himself
had
made
out
of
that
chilling
dream
of
a
dead
universe
ungoverned
by
an
absent
god
the
human
mind
in
germany
especially
tried
during
the
early
part
of
this
century
to
escape
by
strange
roads
roads
by
which
there
was
no
escape
because
they
were
not
laid
down
on
the
firm
ground
of
scientific
facts
then
in
despair
men
turned
to
the
facts
which
they
had
neglected
and
said
we
are
weary
of
philosophy
we
will
study
you
and
you
alone
as
for
god
who
can
find
him
and
they
have
worked
at
the
facts
like
gallant
and
honest
men
and
their
work
like
all
good
work
has
produced
in
the
last
fifty
years
results
more
enormous
than
they
even
dreamed
but
what
are
they
finding
more
and
more
below
their
facts
below
all
phenomena
which
the
scalpel
and
the
microscope
can
show
a
something
nameless
invisible
imponderable
yet
seemingly
omnipresent
and
omnipotent
retreating
before
them
deeper
and
deeper
the
deeper
they
delve
namely
the
life
which
shapes
and
makes
that
which
the
old
called
forma
formativa
which
they
call
vital
force
and
what
not
metaphors
all
or
rather
counters
to
mark
an
unknown
quantity
as
if
they
should
call
it
x
or
y
one
says
it
is
all
vibrations
but
his
reason
unsatisfied
asks
and
what
makes
the
vibrations
vibrate
another
it
is
all
physiological
units
but
his
reason
asks
what
is
the
physis
the
nature
and
innate
tendency
of
the
units
a
third
it
may
be
all
caused
by
infinitely
numerous
gemmules
but
his
reason
asks
him
what
puts
infinite
order
into
those
gemmules
instead
of
infinite
anarchy
i
mention
these
theories
not
to
laugh
at
them
no
man
has
a
deeper
respect
for
those
who
have
put
them
forth
nor
would
it
interfere
with
my
theological
creed
if
any
or
all
of
them
were
proven
to
be
true
i
mention
them
only
to
show
that
beneath
all
these
theories
true
or
false
still
lies
the
unknown
x
scientific
men
are
becoming
more
and
more
aware
of
it
i
had
almost
said
ready
to
worship
it
more
and
more
the
of
them
are
engrossed
by
the
mystery
of
that
unknown
and
truly
miraculous
element
in
nature
which
is
always
escaping
them
though
they
can
not
escape
it
how
should
they
escape
it
was
it
not
written
of
old
whither
shall
i
go
from
thy
presence
or
whither
shall
i
flee
from
thy
spirit
ah
that
we
clergy
would
summon
up
courage
to
tell
them
that
courage
to
tell
them
what
need
not
hamper
for
a
moment
the
freedom
of
their
investigations
what
will
add
to
them
a
sanction
i
may
say
a
sanctity
that
the
unknown
x
which
lies
below
all
phenomena
which
is
for
ever
at
work
on
all
phenomena
on
the
whole
and
on
every
part
of
the
whole
down
to
the
colouring
of
every
leaf
and
the
curdling
of
every
cell
of
protoplasm
is
none
other
than
that
which
the
old
hebrews
called
by
a
metaphor
no
doubt
for
how
can
man
speak
of
the
unseen
save
in
metaphors
drawn
from
the
seen
but
by
the
only
metaphor
adequate
to
express
the
perpetual
and
omnipresent
miracle
breath
of
god
the
spirit
who
is
the
lord
and
giver
of
life
in
the
rest
gentlemen
let
us
think
and
let
us
observe
for
if
we
are
ignorant
not
merely
of
the
results
of
experimental
science
but
of
the
methods
thereof
then
we
and
the
men
of
science
shall
have
no
common
ground
whereon
to
stretch
out
kindly
hands
to
each
other
but
let
us
have
patience
and
faith
and
not
suppose
in
haste
that
when
those
hands
are
stretched
out
it
will
be
needful
for
us
to
leave
our
or
to
cast
ourselves
down
from
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
to
earn
popularity
above
all
from
earnest
students
who
are
too
to
care
for
popularity
themselves
true
if
we
have
an
intelligent
belief
in
those
creeds
and
those
scriptures
which
are
committed
to
our
keeping
then
our
philosophy
can
not
be
that
which
is
just
now
in
vogue
but
all
we
have
to
do
i
believe
is
to
wait
nominalism
and
that
sensationalism
which
has
sprung
from
nominalism
are
running
fast
to
seed
comtism
seems
to
me
its
supreme
effort
after
which
the
whirligig
of
time
may
bring
round
its
revenges
and
realism
and
we
who
own
the
realist
creeds
may
have
our
turn
only
wait
when
a
grave
able
and
authoritative
philosopher
explains
a
mother
love
of
her
newborn
babe
as
professor
bain
has
done
in
a
really
eloquent
passage
of
his
book

then
the
end
of
that
philosophy
is
very

an

more

i
hold
more
philosophic
explanation
of
that
natural
phenomenon
and
of
all
others
may
get
a
hearing

wait
and
fret
not
yourselves

me

i
received
a
book
the
genesis

species
by
george
mivart
the
name
of
the
author
demanded
all
attention
and
respect
and
as
i
read
on
i
found
him
to
my
exceeding
pleasure
advocating
views
which
i
had
long
held
with
a
learning
and
ability
to
which
i
have
no
pretensions
the
book
will
doubtless
excite
much
useful
criticism
and
discussion
in
the
scientific
world
i
hope
that
it
may
do
the
same
in

clerical
world

i
earnestly
beg
those

heard
me
with
so
much
patience

courtesy
at
sion
college
to
ponder
well
mivart
last
chapter
on
theology
and
evolution
quoted
from
schleiden
the
plant
a
biography
lecture
xi
in
fine
i
am
well
aware
what
a
serious
question
is
opened
up
in
these
words
the
fact
that
the
great
majority
of
workers
among
the
social
insects
are
barren
females
or
nuns
devoting
themselves
to
the
care
of
other
individuals
offspring
by
an
act
of
and
that
by
means
of
that
these
communities
grow
large
and
prosperous
ought
to
be
well
weighed
just
now
both
by
those
who
hold
that
morality
has
been
evolved
from
perceptions
of
what
was
useful
or
pleasurable
and
by
those
who
hold
as
i
do
that
morality
is
one
immutable
and
eternal
those
who
take
the
former
view
confounding
as
mivart
well
points
out
in
his
genesis
of
species
material
and
formal
morality
have
no
difficulty
in
tracing
the
germs
of
the
highest
human
morality
in
animals
for
is
in
their
eyes
the
ultimate
ground
of
morality
and
the
average
animal
is
utterly
selfish
but
certain
animals
perform
acts
as
in
the
case
of
working
bees
and
ants
and
as
i
hold
in
the
case
of
mothers
working
for
and
protecting
their
offspring
which
at
least
seem
formally
moral
because
they
seem
founded
on
i
am
well
aware
i
say
again
of
the
very
serious
admissions
which
we
clergymen
should
have
to
make
if
we
confessed
that
these
acts
really
are
that
which
they
seem
to
be
but
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
be
as
just
to
an
ant
as
to
a
human
being
i
am
ready
with
socrates
to
follow
the
logos
whithersoever
it
leads
and
i
hope
that
mivart
will
reconsider
the
two
latter
paragraphs
of
and
let
his
thoughts
play
freely
round
this
curious
subject
perhaps
in
so
doing
he
may
lay
his
hand
on
an
even
sharper
weapon
than
those
which
he
has
already
used
against
the
sensationalist
theory
of
morals
