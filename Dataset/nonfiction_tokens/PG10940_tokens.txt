illustrated

on

the
several
successive
editions
of
the
arts
of
the
middle
ages
and
period
of
the
renaissance
sufficiently
testify
to
its
appreciation
by
the
public
the
object
of
that
work
was
to
introduce
the
reader
to
a
branch
of
learning
to
which
access
had
hitherto
appeared
only
permitted
to
the
scientific
that
attempt
which
was
a
bold
one
succeeded
too
well
not
to
induce
us
to
push
our
researches
further
in
fact
art
alone
can
not
acquaint
us
entirely
with
an
epoch
the
arts
considered
in
their
generality
are
the
true
expressions
of
society
they
tell
us
its
tastes
its
ideas
and
its
character
we
thus
spoke
in
the
preface
to
our
first
work
and
we
find
nothing
to
modify
in
this
opinion
art
must
be
the
faithful
expression
of
a
society
since
it
represents
it
by
its
works
as
it
has
created
them
undeniable
witnesses
of
its
spirit
and
manners
for
future
generations
but
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
art
is
only
the
consequence
of
the
ideas
which
it
expresses
it
is
the
fruit
of
civilisation
not
its
origin
to
understand
the
middle
ages
and
the
renaissance
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
source
of
its
art
and
to
know
the
life
of
our
fathers
these
are
two
inseparable
things
which
entwine
one
another
and
become
complete
one
by
the
other
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
middle
ages
this
subject
is
of
the
greatest
interest
not
only
to
the
man
of
science
but
to
the
man
of
the
world
also
in
it
too
we
retrace
not
only
one
single
period
but
two
periods
quite
distinct
one
from
the
other
in
the
first
the
public
and
private
customs
offer
a
curious
mixture
of
barbarism
and
civilisation
we
find
barbarian
roman
and
christian
customs
and
character
in
presence
of
each
other
mixed
up
in
the
same
society
and
very
often
in
the
same
individuals
everywhere
the
most
adverse
and
opposite
tendencies
display
themselves
what
an
ardent
struggle
during
that
long
period
and
how
full
too
of
emotion
is
its
picture
society
tends
to
reconstitute
itself
in
every
aspect
she
wants
to
create
so
to
say
from
every
side
property
authority
justice
in
a
word
everything
which
can
establish
the
basis
of
public
life
and
this
new
order
of
things
must
be
established
by
means
of
the
elements
supplied
at
once
by
the
barbarian
roman
and
christian
world
a
prodigious
creation
the
working
of
which
occupied
the
whole
of
the
middle
ages
hardly
does
modern
society
civilised
by
christianity
reach
the
fullness
of
its
power
than
it
divides
itself
to
follow
different
paths
ancient
art
and
literature
resuscitates
because
custom
takes
that
direction
under
that
influence
everything
is
modified
both
in
private
and
public
life
the
history
of
the
human
race
does
not
present
a
subject
more
vast
or
more
interesting
it
is
a
subject
we
have
chosen
to
succeed
our
first
book
and
which
will
be
followed
by
a
similar
study
on
the
various
aspects
of
religious
and
military
life
this
work
devoted
to
the
vivid
and
faithful
description
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
middle
ages
and
renaissance
answers
fully
to
the
requirements
of
contemporary
times
we
are
in
fact
no
longer
content
with
the
chronological
narration
and
simple
nomenclatures
which
formerly
were
considered
sufficient
for
education
we
no
longer
imagine
that
the
history
of
our
institutions
has
less
interest
than
that
of
our
wars
nor
that
the
annals
of
the
humbler
classes
are
irrelevant
to
those
of
the
privileged
orders
we
go
further
still
what
is
above
all
sought
for
in
historical
works
nowadays
is
the
physiognomy
the
inmost
character
of
past
generations
how
did
our
fathers
live
is
a
daily
question
what
institutions
had
they
what
were
their
political
rights
can
you
not
place
before
us
their
pastimes
their
hunting
parties
their
meals
and
all
sorts
of
scenes
sad
or
gay
which
composed
their
home
life
we
should
like
to
follow
them
in
public
and
private
occupations
and
to
know
their
manner
of
living
hourly
as
we
know
our
own
in
a
high
order
of
ideas
what
great
facts
serve
as
a
foundation
to
our
history
and
that
of
the
modern
world
we
have
first
royalty
which
weak
and
debased
under
the
merovingians
rises
and
establishes
itself
energetically
under
pépin
and
charlemagne
to
degenerate
under
louis
le
débonnaire
and
charles
le
chauve
after
having
dared
a
second
time
to
found
the
empire
of
the
caesars
it
quickly
sees
its
sovereignty
replaced
by
feudal
rights
and
all
its
rights
usurped
by
the
nobles
and
has
to
struggle
for
many
centuries
to
recover
its
rights
one
by
one
feudalism
evidently
of
germanic
origin
will
also
attract
our
attention
and
we
shall
draw
a
rapid
outline
of
this
legislation
which
barbarian
at
the
onset
becomes
by
degrees
subject
to
the
rules
of
moral
progress
we
shall
ascertain
that
military
service
is
the
essence
itself
of
the
fief
and
that
thence
springs
feudal
right
on
our
way
we
shall
protest
against
civil
wars
and
shall
welcome
emancipation
and
the
formation
of
the
communes
following
the
thousand
details
of
the
life
of
the
people
we
shall
see
the
slave
become
serf
and
the
serf
become
peasant
we
shall
assist
at
the
dispensation
of
justice
by
royalty
and
nobility
at
the
solemn
sittings
of
parliaments
and
we
shall
see
the
complicated
details
of
a
strict
ceremonial
which
formed
an
integral
part
of
the
law
develop
themselves
before
us
the
counters
of
dealers
fairs
and
markets
manufactures
commerce
and
industry
also
merit
our
attention
we
must
search
deeply
into
corporations
of
workmen
and
tradesmen
examining
their
statutes
and
initiating
ourselves
into
their
business
fashion
and
dress
are
also
a
manifestation
of
public
and
private
customs
for
that
reason
we
must
give
them
particular
attention
and
to
accomplish
the
work
we
have
undertaken
we
are
lucky
to
have
the
conscientious
studies
of
our
old
associates
in
the
great
work
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
renaissance

assist
us

says
the
learned
benjamin
guérard
is
the
produce
of
pagan
civilisation
of
germanic
barbarism
and
of
christianity
it
began
in
on
the
fall
of
agustulus
and
ended
in
at
the
taking
of
constantinople
by
mahomet
and
consequently
the
fall
of
two
empires
that
of
the
west
and
that
of
the
east
marks
its
duration
its
first
act
which
was
due
to
the
germans
was
the
destruction
of
political
unity
and
this
was
destined
to
be
afterwards
replaced
by
religions
unity
then
we
find
a
multitude
of
scattered
and
disorderly
influences
growing
on
the
ruins
of
central
power
the
yoke
of
imperial
dominion
was
broken
by
the
barbarians
but
the
populace
far
from
acquiring
liberty
fell
to
the
lowest
degrees
of
servitude
instead
of
one
despot
it
found
thousands
of
tyrants
and
it
was
but
slowly
and
with
much
trouble
that
it
succeeded
in
freeing
itself
from
feudalism
nothing
could
be
more
strangely
troubled
than
the
west
at
the
time
of
the
dissolution
of
the
empire
of
the
caesars
nothing
more
diverse
or
more
discordant
than
the
interests
the
institutions
and
the
state
of
society
which
were
delivered
to
the
germans
figs
and
in
fact
it
would
be
impossible
in
the
whole
pages
of
history
to
find
a
society
formed
of
more
heterogeneous
or
incompatible
elements
on
the
one
side
might
be
placed
the
goths
burgundians
vandals
germans
franks
saxons
and
lombards
nations
or
more
strictly
hordes
accustomed
to
rough
and
successful
warfare
and
on
the
other
the
romans
including
those
people
who
by
long
servitude
to
roman
dominion
had
become
closely
allied
with
their
conquerors
fig
there
were
on
both
sides
freemen
freedmen
colons
and
slaves
different
ranks
and
degrees
being
however
observable
both
in
freedom
and
servitude
this
hierarchical
principle
applied
itself
even
to
the
land
which
was
divided
into
freeholds
tributary
lands
lands
of
the
nobility
and
servile
lands
thus
constituting
the
freeholds
the
benefices
the
fiefs
and
the
tenures
it
may
be
added
that
the
customs
and
to
a
certain
degree
the
laws
varied
according
to
the
masters
of
the
country
so
that
it
can
hardly
be
wondered
at
that
everywhere
diversity
and
inequality
were
to
be
found
and
as
a
consequence
that
anarchy
and
confusion
ruled
supreme

not
sufficiently
insist
upon
this
important
point
that
from
the
day
on
which
the
adventurous
habits
of
the
chiefs
of
germanic
origin
gave
place
to
the
desire
for
territorial
possessions
the
part
played
by
the
land
increased
insensibly
towards
defining
the
position
of
the
persons
holding
it
domains
became
small
kingdoms
over
which
the
lord
assumed
the
most
absolute
and
arbitrary
rights
a
rule
was
soon
established
that
the
nobility
was
inherent
to
the
soil
and
consequently
that
the
land
ought
to
transmit
to
its
possessors
the
rights
of
nobility
this
privilege
was
so
much
accepted
that
the
long
tenure
of
a
fief
ended
by
ennobling
the
commoner
subsequently
by
a
sort
of
compensation
which
naturally
followed
lands
on
which
rent
had
hitherto
been
paid
became
free
and
noble
on
passing
to
the
possession
of
a
noble
at
last
however
the
contrary
rule
prevailed
which
caused
the
lands
not
to
change
quality
in
changing
owners
the
noble
could
still
possess
the
labourers
lands
without
losing
his
nobility
but
the
labourer
could
be
proprietor
of
a
fief
without
thereby
becoming
a
noble

the
who
according
to
tacitus
attached
themselves

of
the
germanic
chiefs

formed

of

importance

to
the

and
although
they
composed
his
ordinary
council
they
did
not
hesitate
at
times
to
declare
themselves
openly

originally
the
possession
of
a
benefice
or
fief
meant
no
more
than
the
privilege
of
enjoying
the
profits
derived
from
the
land
a
concession
which
made
the
holder

they
had
conquered
but
later
on
everything
was
equally
given
to
be
held
in
fief
namely
dignities
offices
rights
and
incomes
or
titles
it
is
important
to
remark
and
it
is
in
this
alone
that
feudalism
shows
its
social
bearing
that
if
the
vassal
owed
obedience
and
devotion
to
his
lord
the
lord
in
exchange
owed
protection
to
the
vassal
the
rank
of
free
man
did
not
necessarily
require
the
possession
of
land
but
the
position
of
free
men
who
did
not
hold
fiefs
was
extremely
delicate
and
often
painful
for
they
were
by
natural
right
dependent
upon
those
on
whose
domain
they
resided
in
fact
the
greater
part
of
these
nobles
without
lands
became
by
choice
the
king
men
and
remained
attached
to
his
service
if
this
failed
them
they
took
lands
on
lease
so
as
to
support
themselves
and
their
families
and
to
avoid
falling
into
absolute
servitude
in
the
event
of
a
change
of
proprietor
they
changed
with
the
land
into
new
hands
nevertheless
it
was
not
uncommon
for
them
to
be
so
reduced
as
to
sell
their
freedom
but
in
such
cases
they
reserved
the
right
should
better
times
come
of
their
liberty
by
paying
more
than
the
sum
for
which
they
had
sold
it
we
thus
see
that
in
olden
times
as
also
later
freedom
was
more
or
less
the
natural
consequence
of
the
possession
of
wealth
or
power
on
the
part
of
individuals
or
families
who
considered
themselves
free
in
the
midst
of
general
dependence
during
the
tenth
century
indeed
if
not
impossible
it
was
at
least
difficult
to
find
a
single
inhabitant
of
the
kingdom
of
france
who
was
not
the
man
of
some

who
was
either

most

it

a

constituted
before

the

there
was
also
a

of

influence
on

power
was
not

than
that
of

without

became

man
in

of
this
the
serfs
and

fig
emigrated
from
all
parts
in
order
to
profit
by
these
advantages
to
such
a
degree
that
the
lands
of
the
nobles
became
deserted
by
all
the
serfs
of
different
degrees
and
were
in
danger
of
remaining

attempted

create
on

domains
analogous
to
those
of
royalty
but
however
liberal
these
ameliorations
might
appear
to
be
it
was
difficult
for
the
nobles
not
only
to
concede
privileges
equal
to
those
emanating
from
the
throne
but
also
to
ensure
equal
protection
to
those
they
thus
enfranchised
in
spite
of
this
however
the
result
was
that
a
double
current
of
enfranchisement
was
established
which
resulted
in
the
daily
diminution
of
the
miserable
order
of
serfs
and
which
whilst
it
emancipated
the
lower
orders
had
the
immediate
result

giving
increased
weight
and
power
to
royalty
both
in
its
own
domains
and
in

of

these
social
revolutions
did
not

operate
suddenly
nor
did
they
at

abolish

still

were

in

of

to
such
a
degree
that
the

could
appropriate

his
life

after
death
if
he
chose
all
he
possessed
he
could
imprison
him
him
as
he
thought
proper
without
having
to
answer
to
any
one

the
other
though
held
equally
in

was
more
liberally
treated
for

was

ask
of
him
nothing

owed

this
name
was
apparently
chosen
because
the
hand
considered
the
symbol
of
power
and
the
instrument
of
donation
was
deprived
of
movement
paralysed
in
fact
struck
as
by
death
it
was
also
nearly
in
this
sense
that
men
of
the
church
were
also
called
men
of
mortmain
because
they
were
equally
forbidden
to
dispose
either
in
life
or
by
will
after
death
of
anything
belonging
to
them
there
were
two
kinds
of
mortmain
real
and
personal
one
concerning
land
and
the
other
concerning
the
person
that
is
to
say
land
held
in
mortmain
did
not
change
quality
whatever
might
be
the
position
of
the
person
who
occupied
it
and
a
man
of
mortmain
did
not
cease
to
suffer
the
inconveniences
of
his
position
on
whatever
land
he
went
to
establish
himself
the
mortmains
were
generally
subject
to
the
greater
share
of
feudal
obligations
formerly
imposed
on
serfs
these
were
particularly
to
work
for
a
certain
time
for
their
lord
without
receiving
any
wages
or
else
to
pay
him
the
when
it
was
due
on
certain
definite
occasions
as
for
example
when
he
married
when
he
gave
a
dower
to
his
daughter
when
he
was
taken
prisoner
of
war
when
he
went
to
the
holy
land
what
particularly
characterized
the
condition
of
mortmains
was
that
the
lords
had
the
right
to
take
all
their
goods
when
they
died
without
issue
or
when
the
children
held
a
separate
household
and
that
they
could
not
dispose
of
anything
they
possessed
either
by
will
or
gift
beyond
a
certain
sum
the
noble
who
franchised
mortmains
imposed
on
them
in
almost
all
cases
very
heavy
conditions
consisting
of
fees
labours
and
fines
of
all
sorts
in
fact
a
mortmain
person
to
be
free
not
only
required
to
be
franchised
by
his
own
lord
but
also
by
all
the
nobles
on
whom
he
was
dependent
as
well
as
by
the
sovereign
if
a
noble
franchised
without
the
consent
of
his
superiors
he
incurred
a
fine
as
it
was
considered
a
dismemberment
or
depreciation
of
the
fief
as
early
as
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
rigorous
laws
of
mortmain
began
to
fall
into
disuse
in
the
provinces
though
if
the
name
began
to
disappear
the
condition
itself
continued
to
exist
the
free
men
whether
they
belonged
to
the
middle
class
or
to
the
peasantry
were
nevertheless
still
subject
to
pay
fines
or
obligations
to
their
lords
of
such
a
nature
that
they
must
be
considered
to
have
been
practically
in
the
same
position
as
mortmains
in
fact
this
custom
had
been
so
deeply
rooted
into
social
habits
by
feudalism
that
to
make
it
disappear
totally
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
required
three
decrees
of
the
national
convention
july
and
october
and
ventôse
year
that
is
march
it
is
only
just
to
state
that
twelve
or
fourteen
years
earlier
louis
xvi
had
done
all
in
his
power
towards
the
same
purpose
by
suppressing
mortmain
both
real
or
personal
on
the
lands
of
the
crown
and

mortmain

all
the

of

rights

assumed
by
the
nobility
these
rights
and
privileges
which
we
are
about
to
pass
summarily
in
review
were
numerous
and
often
curious
amongst
them
may
be
mentioned
the
rights
of
the
rights
of

the
rights

fairs

rights

the
rights

those
which
gave
full
power
to
dukes
and
counts
over
all
minerals
found
on
their
properties
it
was
in
asserting
this
right
that
the
famous
richard
coeur
de
lion
king
of
england
met
his
death
adhémar
viscount
of
limoges
had
discovered
in
a
field
a
treasure
of
which
no
doubt
public
report
exaggerated
the
value
for
it
was
said
to
be
large
enough
to
model
in
pure
gold
and
a
roman
emperor
and
the
members
of
his
family
at
table
adhémar
was
a
vassal
of
the
duke
of
guienne
and
as
a
matter
of
course
set
aside
what
was
considered
the
sovereign
share
in
his
discovery
but
richard
refusing
to
concede
any
part
of
his
privilege
claimed
the
whole
treasure
on
the
refusal
of
the
viscount
to
give
it
up
he
appeared
under
arms
before
the
gates
of
the
castle

chalus

he
supposed
that
the
treasure
was
hidden

a
noble
stand
one
evening
as
his
troops
were
assaulting
the
place
in
order
to
witness
the
scene
richard
was
sitting
at
a
short
distance
on
a
piece
of
rock
protected
with
a
target
that
is
a
large
shield
covered
with
leather
and
blades
of
iron
which
two
archers
held
over
him
impatient
to
see
the
result
of
the
assault
richard
pushed
down
the
shield
and
that
moment
decided
his
fate
an
archer
of
chalus
who
had
recognised
him
and
was
watching
from
the
top
of
the
rampart
sent
a
bolt
from
a
crossbow
which
hit
him
full
in
the
chest
the
wound
however
would
perhaps
not
have
been
mortal
but
shortly
after
having
carried
the
place
by
storm
and
in
his
delight
at
finding
the
treasure
almost
intact
he
gave
himself
up
madly
to
degrading
orgies
during
which
he
had
already
dissipated
the
greater
part
of
his
treasure
and
died
of
his
wound
twelve
days
later
first
having
however
graciously
pardoned
the
bowman
who
caused
his
death
the
right
of
shipwrecks
which
the
nobles
of
seaboard
countries
rarely
renounced
and
of
which
they
were
the
more
jealous
from
the
fact
that
they
had
continually
to
dispute
them
with
their
vassals
and
neighbours
was
the
pitiless

the
right
of
or
reprisal
was
a
most
barbarous
custom
a
famous
example
is
given
of
it
in
william
the
pious
count
of
angoulême
before
starting
for
a
pilgrimage
to
rome
made
his
three
brothers
who
were
his
vassals
swear
to
live
in
honourable
peace
and
good
friendship
but
notwithstanding
their
oath
two
of
the
brothers
having
invited
the
third
to
the
easter
festivities
seized
him
at
night
in
his
bed
put
out
his
eyes
so
that
he
might
not
find
the
way
to
his
castle
and
cut
out
his
tongue
so
that
he
might
not
name
the
authors
of
this
horrible
treatment
the
voice
of
god
however
denounced
them
and
the
count
of
angoulême
shuddering
with
horror
referred
the
case
to
his
sovereign
the
duke
of
aquitaine
william
who
immediately
came
and
by
fire
and
sword
exercised
his
right
of
on
the
lands
of
the
two
brothers
leaving
them
nothing
but
their
lives
and
limbs
after
having
first
put
out
their
eyes
and
cut
out
their
tongues
so
as
to
inflict
on
them
the
penalty
of
retaliation
the
right
of
sporting
or
hunting
was
of
all
prerogatives
that
dearest
to
and
most
valued
by
the
nobles
not
only
were
the
severest
and
even
cruellest
penalties
imposed
on
vilains
who
dared
to
kill
the
smallest
head
of
game
but
quarrels
frequently
arose
between
nobles
of
different
degrees
on
the
subject
some
pretending
to
have
a
feudal
privilege
of
hunting
on
the
lands
of
others
fig
from
this
tyrannical
exercise
of
the
right
of
hunting
which
the
least
powerful
of
the
nobles
only
submitted
to
with
the
most
violent
and
bitter
feelings
sprung
those
old
and
familiar
ballads
which
indicate
the
popular
sentiment
on
the
subject
in
some
of
these
songs
the
inveterate
hunters
are
condemned
by
the
order
of
fairies
or
of
the
fates
either
to
follow
a
phantom
stag
for
everlasting
or
to
hunt
like
king
artus
in
the
clouds
and
to
catch
a
fly
every
hundred
years
the
right
of
jurisdiction
which
gave
judicial
power
to
the
dukes
and
counts
in
cases
arising
in
their
domains
had
no
appeal
save
to
the
king
himself
and
this
was
even
often
contested
by
the
nobles
as
for
instance
in
the
unhappy
case
of
enguerrand
de
coucy
enguerrand
had
ordered
three
young
flemish
noblemen
who
were
scholars
at
the
abbey
of
nicholas
des
bois
to
be
seized
and
hung
because
not
knowing
that
they
were
on
the
domain
of
the
lord
of
coucy
they
had
killed
a
few
rabbits
with
arrows
louis
called
the
case
before
him
enguerrand
answered
to
the
call
but
only
to
dispute
the
king
right
and
to
claim
the
judgment
of
his
peers
the
king
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
remonstrance
ordered
enguerrand
to
be
locked
up
in
the
big
tower
of
the
louvre
and
was
nearly
applying
the
law
of
to
his
case
eventually
he
granted
him
letters
of
pardon
after
condemning
him
to
build
three
chapels
where
masses
were
continually
to
be
said
for
the
three
victims
to
give
the
forest
where
the
young
scholars
had
been
found
hunting
to
the
abbey
of
nicholas
des
bois
to
lose
on
all
his
estates
the
rights
of
jurisdiction

serve
three
years
in
the
holy
land
and
to
pay
to
the
king
a
fine
of
pounds
tournois
it
must
be
remembered
that
louis
although
most
generous
in
cases
relating
simply
to
private
interests
was
one
of
the
most
stubborn
defenders
of
royal
prerogatives
a
right
which
feudalists
had
the
greatest
interest
in
observing
and
causing
to
be
respected
because
they
themselves
might
with
their
wandering
habits
require
it
at
any
moment
was
that
of
or
this
right
was
so
powerful
that
it
even
applied
itself
to
the
lower
orders
and
its
violation
was
considered
the
most
odious
crime
thus
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
king
of
aragon
was
severely
abused
by
all
persons
and
all
classes
because
in
spite
of
this
right
he
caused
a
jew
to
be
burned
so
as
not
to
have
to
pay
a
debt

immediate
justice

certainly
have
suffered
no
vindication
if
the
culprit
condemned
to
death
had
belonged
to

middle

lower
orders
we
must
nevertheless
remember
that
heavy
dues
fell
upon
the
privileged
class
themselves
to
a
certain
degree
and
that
if
they
taxed
their
poor
vassals
without
mercy
they
had
in
their
turn
often
to
reckon
with
their
superiors
in
the
feudal
hierarchy
or
right
of
shelter
was
the
principal
charge
imposed
upon
the
noble
when
a
great
baron
visited
his
lands
his
tenants
were
not
only
obliged
to
give
him
and
his
followers
shelter
but
also
provisions
and
food
the
nature
and
quality
of
which
were
all
arranged
beforehand
with
the
most
extraordinary
minuteness
the
lesser
nobles
took
advantage
sometimes
of
the
power
they
possessed
to
repurchase
this
obligation
but
the
rich
on
the
contrary
were
most
anxious
to
seize
the
occasion
of
proudly
displaying
before
their
sovereign
all
the
pomp
in
their
power
at
the
risk
even
of
mortgaging
their
revenues
for
several
years
and
of
ruining
their
vassals
history
is
full
of
stories
bearing
witness
to
the
extravagant
prodigalities
of
certain
nobles
on
such
occasions
payments
in
kind
fell
generally
on
the
abbeys

to
that
of
denis
which
was
very
rich
in
lands
was
charged
with
supplying
the
house
and
table
of
the
king
this
tax
which
became
heavier
and
heavier
eventually
fell
on
the
parisians
who
only
succeeded
in
ridding
themselves
of
it
in
when
charles
made
all
the
bourgeois
of
paris
noble
in
the
twelfth
century
all
furniture
made
of
wood
or
iron
which
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
bishop

only
required
to
present
the
sovereign
with
two

annually
so
as
to
keep
up
the
old
system
of
fines
this
system
of
rents
and
dues
of
all
kinds
was
so
much
the
basis
of
social
organization
in
the
middle
ages
that
it
sometimes
happened
that
the
lower
orders
benefited
by
it
thus
the

belonged
after

by
the
double
current
of
ideas
which
simultaneously
urged
her
on
to
a
new
state
of
civilisation
and
more
particularly
to
a
new
organization
of
city
life
italy
was
naturally
destined
to
be
the
country
where
the
new
trials
of
social
regeneration
were
to
be
made
but
she
presented
the
greatest
possible
variety
of
customs
laws
and
governments
including
emperor
pope
bishops
and
feudal
princes
in
tuscany
and
liguria
the
march
towards
liberty
was
continued
almost
without
effort
whilst
in
lombardy
on
the
contrary
the
feudal
resistance
was
very
powerful
everywhere
however
cities
became
more
or
less
completely
enfranchised
though
some
more
rapidly
than
others
in
sicily
feudalism
swayed
over
the
countries
but
in
the
greater
part
of
the
peninsula
the
democratic
spirit
of
the
cities
influenced
the
enfranchisement
of
the
rural
population
the
feudal
caste
was
in
fact
dissolved
the
barons
were
transformed
into
patricians
of
the
noble
towns
which
gave
their
republican
magistrates
the
old
title
of
consuls
the
teutonic
emperor

sought
to
seize
and
turn
to
his
own
interest
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
who
had
shaken
off
the
yokes
of
his
vassals
the
signal
of
war
was
immediately
given
by
the
newly
enfranchised
masses
and
the
imperial
eagle
was
obliged
to
fly
before
the
banners
of
the
besieged
cities
happy
indeed
might
the
cities
of
italy
have
been
had
they
not
forgotten
in
their
prosperity
that
union
alone
could
give
them
the
possibility
of
maintaining
that
liberty
which
they
so
freely
risked
in
continual
quarrels

with

nobility
and
although
the
latter
at
first
would
only
recognise
them
as
good

the

knew
how
to
make
a
position

themselves
in
the
hierarchy
if
the

which
was
a
powerful
expression

did
no
succeed
in
suppressing

that
one
is
struck
with
admiration
at
the
efforts
of
intelligence
and
patriotism
often
uselessly
lavished
on
such
small
political
arenas
the
consulate
which
nominally
at

found
its
origin
in

ancient
grandeur
of
southern
regions
did
not
spread
itself

the
system

took

some
places
the
revolution
was
effected
without
difficulty
but
in
others
it
gave
rise
to

most

active

a
short
time
developed

rapidity
but
in

counties

france
the
greater
part
of
the
towns
were
still
much
oppressed
by
the
counts
and
bishops
if
some
obtained
certain
franchises
these
privileges
were
their
ultimate
ruin

the
ill

the

caused
the
regeneration
of

the
inhabitants
of

formed
a
community

association
and
took
an
oath
that
they
would
obtain
and
maintain
certain
rights
they
rebelled
about
and
forced
the
count
and
his
noble
vassals
to
grant
them
the
freedom
which
they
had
sworn
to
obtain
though
william
of
normandy
very
soon
restored
the
rebel
city
to
order
and
dissolved
the
presumptuous
community
however
the
example
soon
bore
fruit

in
its
turn
and
proclaimed
the
commune
and
although
its
bishop
aided
by
treason
and
by
the
count
of
hainault
reduced
it
to
obedience
it
only
seemed
to
succumb
for
a
time
to
renew
the
struggle
with
greater
success
at
a
subsequent
period

we

the

we
must
not
mistake
the
true
meaning
of
this
word
which
under
a
latin

expresses
originally
a
germanic
idea
and
in
its
new
form
a
christian
mode
of
living
societies

guilds
had
never
disappeared
from
germanic

indeed
knighthood
itself
was

a

persons
taking
some
common
oath

which
feudalism
gave
so
striking
an
example
could
not
fail
to
influence
the
minds
of
the
rustics
and
the
lower
classes
and
they
only
wanted
the
opportunity
which
the
idea
of
the
commune
at
once
gave
them
of
imitating
their
superiors
they
too
took
oaths
and
possessed
their
bodies
and
souls

seized
by
force

swore
to
spare
neither

nor
their

in
order
to
free
themselves
and
not
content
with
defending
themselves
behind
barricades
or
chains
which
closed
the
streets
they
boldly
took
the
offensive
against
the
proud
feudal
chiefs
before
whom
their
fathers
had
trembled
and
they
forced
the
nobles
who
now
saw
themselves
threatened
by
this
armed
multitude
to
acknowledge
their
franchise
by
a
solemn
covenant
it
does
not
follow
that
everywhere
the
commune
was
established
by
means
of
insurrection

it
was
obtained

all

struggles

were

places
for
gold

by

communes
ended
from

the
movement
spread
in

direction
of
the
german
empire
and
there
too
the
struggle
was
animated
and
victorious
against
the
aristocracy
until
at
last
the
great
system
of
enfranchisement
prevailed
and
the
cities
of
the
west
and
south
formed
a
confederation
against
the
nobles
whilst
those
in
the
north
formed
the
famous

celebrated

the

the
movement

progress
was
considerably
delayed
by
the
close
influence
of
royalty
which
sometimes
conceded
large
franchises
and
sometimes
suppressed
the
least
claims
to
independence
the
kings
who
willingly
favoured
communes
on
the
properties
of
their
neighbours
did
not
so
much
care
to
see
them
forming
on
their
own
estates

the
exceptional
position
and
importance
of
any
town
required
a
wise
exercise
of
tolerance
thus
orleans
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
royal
domains
was
roughly
repulsed

its

movement
whilst
mantes
which
was
on

frontier
of
the
duchy
of
normandy
and
still
under
the
king
of
england
had
but
to
ask
in
order
to
receive
its
franchise
from
the
king
of
france
it
was
particularly
in
the
royal
domains
that
cities
were
to
be
found
which
although
they
did
not
possess
the
complete
independence
of
communes
had
a
certain
amount
of
liberty
and
civil
guarantees
they
had
neither
the
right
of

the
nor
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
their
elected
magistrates

consent

succeeded

creating
for
itself

existence
the
influence
originated
in

the

of
or
the
corporation
of

formed
a
centre
round
which
were
successively
attached
various
bodies
of
different
trades
gradually
a
strong
concourse
of
civic
powers
was
established
which
succeeded
in
electing
a
municipal
council
composed
of
a
provost
of
merchants
four
aldermen
and
councillors
of
the
town
this
council
afterwards
succeeded
in
overstepping
the
royal
influence
at
difficult
times
and
was
destined
to
play
a
prominent
part
in
history
there
also
sprang
up
a
lower
order
of
towns
or
boroughs
than
these
bourgeois
cities
which
were
especially
under
the
crown
not
having
sufficient
strength
to
claim
a
great
amount
of
liberty
they
were
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
a
few
privileges
conceded
to
them
by
the
nobles
for
the
most
part
with
a
political
end
these
were
the
free
towns
or
new
towns
which
we
have
already
named
however
it
came
about
it
is
certain
that
although
during
the
tenth
century
feudal
power
was
almost
supreme
in
europe
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
the
municipal
system
had
gained
great
weight
and
was
constantly
progressing
until
the
policy
of
the
kingdom
became
developed
on
a
more
and
more
extended
basis
so
that
it
was
then
necessary
for
it
to
give
up
its
primitive
nature
and
to
participate
in
the
great
movement
of
consolidisation
and
national
unity
in
this
way
the
position
of
the
large
towns
in
the
state
relatively
lost
their
individual
position
and
became
somewhat
analogous
as
compared
with
the
kingdom
at
large
to
that
formerly
held
by
bourgeois
in
the
cities
friendly
ties
arose
between
provinces
and
distinct
and
rival
interests
were
effaced
by
the
general
aspiration
towards
common
objects
the
towns
were
admitted
to
the
states
general
and
the
citizens
of
various
regions
mixed
as
representatives
of
the
three
orders
thus
met
who
were
destined
to
struggle
for
predominance
in
the
future
we
must
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
henri
martin
says
by
an
apparent
contradiction
the
fall
of
the
communes
declared
itself
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
progress
of
the
by
degrees
as
the
government
became
more
settled
from
the
great
fiefs
being
absorbed
by
the
crown
and
as
parliament
and
other
courts
of
appeal
which
emanated
from
the
middle
class
extended
their
high
judiciary
and
military
authority
so
the
central
power
organized
under
monarchical
form
must
necessarily
have
been
less
disposed
to
tolerate
the
local
independence
of
the
communes
the
state
replaced
the
commune
for
everything
concerning
justice
war
and
administration
no
doubt
some
valuable
privileges
were
lost
but
that
was
only
an
accidental
circumstance
for
a
great
social
revolution
was
produced
which
cleared
off
at
once
all
the
relics
of
the
old
age
and
when
the
work
of
reconstruction
terminated
homage
was
rendered
to
the
venerable
name
of
commune
which
became
uniformly
applied
to
all
towns
boroughs
or
villages
into
which
the
new
spirit
of
the
same
municipal
system
was
infused

this

possessed
the

aspect
of

of

it
was
a
large
building
surrounded
with
porticos
of
roman
architecture
sometimes
built
of
carefully
polished
and
sculptured
wood
which
in
no
way
was
wanting
in
elegance
around
the
main
body
of
the
building
were
arranged
the
dwellings
of
the
officers
of
the
palace
either
foreigners
or
romans
and
those
of
the
chiefs
of
companies
who
according
to
germanic
custom
had
placed
themselves
and
their
warriors
under
the
king
that
is
to
say
under
a
special
engagement
of
vassalage
and
fidelity
other

there
was
something
too
in
the
position
of
these

which
resembled
the

the

were

sufficient
to
study
carefully
a
very
small
portion
of
the

in
order
to
form
some
idea
of
the
manners

of

down

as

private
life
however
of
the
different
classes
in
this
elementary
form
of
society
we
have
but
approximate
and
very
imperfect
notions
it
is
clear
however
that
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
the
merovingian
race
there
was
much
more
luxury
and
comfort
among
the
upper
classes
than
is
generally
supposed
all
the
gold
and
silver
furniture
all
the
jewels
and
all
the
rich
stuffs
which
the
had
amassed
in
their
sumptuous
dwellings
had
not
been
destroyed
by
the
barbarians
the
frank
kings
had
appropriated
the
greater
part
and
the
rest
had
fallen

that
concerning
the
vase
of
soissons
fig
which
king
clovis
wished
to
preserve
and
which

broke
with
an

proves
that
many
gems
of
ancient
art
must
have
disappeared
owing
to
the
ignorance
and
brutality
of
the
conquerors
although
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
latter
soon
adopted
the
tastes
and
customs
of
the
native
population
at
first
they
appropriated
everything
that
flattered
their
pride
and
sensuality
this
is
how
the
material
remains
of
the
civilisation
of
the
gauls
were
preserved
in
the
royal
and

gregory

that
when

wife
of
chilpéric
gave
the
hand
of
her
daughter
rigouthe
to
the
son
of
the
gothic
king
fifty
chariots
were
required
to
carry
away
all
the
valuable
objects
which
composed
the
princess
dower
a
strange
family
scene
related
by
the
same
historian
gives
us
an
idea
of
the
private
habits
of
the
court
of
that
terrible
queen
of
the
franks
the
mother
and
daughter
had
frequent
quarrels
which
sometimes
ended
in
the
most
violent
encounters
frédégonde
said
one
day
to
rigouthe
do
you
continually
trouble
me
here
are

goods
of
your
father

them
and
do
as
you
like
with
them

she
locked

large
box
filled
with

after
having
pulled
out
a
great
number
of
jewels

she
gave

she
said

put

you
find

bent
down
to
reach
the
objects
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
upon
which
frédégonde
immediately
lowered
the
lid
on
her
daughter
and
pressed
upon
it
with
so
much
force
that
the
eyes
began
to
start

the

head
a
maid
began
screaming

mistress
is
being
murdered
by
her
mother
and
rigouthe
was
saved
from
an
untimely
end
it
is
further
related
that
this
was
only
one
of
the
minor
crimes
attributed
by
history
to
frédégonde
who
always
carried
a
dagger
or
poison
about
with
her
amongst
the
franks
as
amongst
all
barbaric
populations
hunting
was
the
pastime
preferred
when
war
was
not
being
waged
the
merovingian
nobles
were
therefore
determined
hunters
and
it
frequently
happened
that
hunting
occupied
whole
weeks
and
took
them
far
from
their
homes
and
families
but
when
the
season
or
other
circumstances
prevented
them
from
waging
war
against
men
or
beasts
they
only
cared
for
feasting
and
gambling
to
these
occupations
they
gave
themselves
up
with
a
determination
and
wildness
well
worthy
of
those
times
it
was
the
custom
for
invited
guests
to
appear
armed
at
the
feasts
which
were
the
more
frequent
inasmuch
as
they
were
necessarily
accompanied
with
religious
ceremonies
it
often
happened
that
these
long
repasts
followed
by
games
of
chance
were
stained
with
blood
either
in
private
quarrels
or
in
a
general
one
can
easily
imagine
the
tumult
which
must
have
arisen
in
a
numerous
assembly
when
the
hot
wine
and
other
fermented
drinks
such
as
beer
had
excited
every
one
to
the
highest
pitch
of
unchecked
merriment

some
of
the
merovingian

listened
to
the
advice
of
the
ministers
of
the
catholic
religion
and
tried
to
reform
these
noisy
excesses
and
themselves
abandoned
the
evil
custom
for
this
purpose
they
received
at
their
tables
bishops
who
blessed
the
assembly
at
the
commencement
of
the
meal
and
were
charged
besides
to
recite
chapters
of
holy
writ

to

charlemagne
in

was
himself
one
of
the
most
attentive
followers
of
the
lessons
given
by

charlemagne
took
as
much
pains
with
the
administration
of
his
palace
as
he
did
with
that
of
his
states
in
his
capitulaires
a
work
he
wrote
on
legislature
we
find
him
descending
to
the
minutest
details
in
that
respect
for
instance
he
not
only
interested
himself
in
his
warlike
and
hunting
equipages
but
also
in
his
kitchen
and
pleasure
gardens
he
insisted
upon
knowing
every
year
the
number
of
his
oxen

and

he
calculated
the

gathered
in

orchards
which
were
not
required
for
the
use
of
his

caught

the
shrubs
best
calculated
for
ornamenting
his

and
the

which
were
required
for
his
table
the
emperor
generally
assumed
the
greatest
simplicity
in
his
dress
his
daily
attire
consisted
of
a
linen
shirt
and
drawers
and
a
woollen
tunic
fastened
with
a
silk
belt
over
this
tunic
he
threw
a
cloak
of
blue
stuff
very
long
behind
and
before
but
very
short
on
each
side
thus
giving
freedom
to
his
arms
to
use

sword
which
he
always
wore

he
wore

colours
crossed
over
one
another
and

also
in

when
he
travelled
or
hunted
on
horseback
he
threw
over
his
shoulders
a
covering

otter
or
sheepskin
the
changes
in
fashion
which
the
custom
of
the
times
necessitated
but
to
which
he
would
never
submit
personally
induced
him
to
issue
several
strenuous
orders
which
however
in
reality
had
hardly
any
effect
he
was
most
simple
as
regards
his
food
and
drink
and
made
a
habit
of
having
pious
or
historical
works
read
to
him
during
his
repasts
he
devoted
the
morning
which
with
him
began
in
summer
at
sunrise
and
in
winter
earlier
to
the
political
administration
of
his
empire
he
dined
at
twelve
with
his
family
the
dukes
and
chiefs
of
various
nations
first
waited
on
him
and
then
took
their
places
at
the
table
and
were
waited
on
in
their
turn
by
the
counts
prefects
and
superior
officers
of
the
court
who
dined
after
them
when
these
had
finished
the
different

household
sat
down
and
they
were
succeeded
lastly
by
servants
of
the
lower
order
who
often
did
not
dine
till
midnight
and
had
to
content
themselves
with
what
was
left
when
occasion
required
however
this
powerful
emperor
knew
how
to
maintain
the
pomp
and
dignity
of
his
station
but
as
soon
as
he
had
done
what
was
necessary
either
for
some
great
religious
festival
or
otherwise
he
returned
as
if
by
instinct
to
his
dear
and
native
simplicity
it
must
be
understood
that
the
simple
tastes
of
charlemagne
were
not
always
shared
by
the
princes
and
princesses
of
his
family
nor
by
the
magnates

such
as

that

side

on

other
who
being
masters
of
the
spanish
peninsula
spread
like
the
rising
tide
in
the
southern
counties
of
languedoc
and
provence
it
is
true
that
the
carlovingian
warriors
obtained
a
handsome
and
rich
reward
for
these
long
and
sanguinary
efforts
for
at
last
they
seized
upon
the
provinces
and
districts
which
had
been
originally
entrusted
to
their
charge
and
the
origin
of
their
feudal
possession
was
soon
so
far
forgotten
that
their
descendants
pretended
that
they
held
the
lands
which
they
had
really
usurped
regardless
of
their
oath
from
heaven
and
their
swords
it
is
needless
to
say
that
at
that
time
the
domestic
life
in
these
castles
must
have
been
dull
and
monotonous
although
according
to
guizot
the
loneliness
which
was
the
resuit
of
this
rough
and
laborious
life
became
by
degrees
the
pioneer
of
civilisation
when
the
owner
of
the
fief
left
his
castle
his
wife
remained
there
though
in
a
totally
different
position
from
that
which
women
generally
held
she
remained
as
mistress
representing
her
husband
and
was
charged
with
the
defence
and
honour
of
the
fief
this
high
and
exalted
position
in
the
centre
of
domestic
life
often
gave
to
women
an
opportunity
of
displaying
dignity
courage
virtue
and
intelligence
which
would
otherwise
have
remained
hidden
and
no
doubt
contributed
greatly
to
their
moral
development
and
to
the
general
improvement
of
their
condition

the
importance
of
children
and
particularly
of
the
eldest
son
was
greater
in
feudal
houses
than
elsewhere
the
eldest
son
of
the
noble
was
in
the
eyes
of
his
father
and
of
all
his
followers
a
prince
and
and
the
hope
and
glory
of
the
dynasty
these
feelings
and
the
domestic
pride
and
affection
of
the
various
members
one
to
another
united
to
give
families
much
energy
and
power
add
to
this
the
influence
of
christian
ideas
and
it
will
be
understood
how
this
lonely
dull
and
hard
castle
life
was
nevertheless
favourable
to
the
development
of
domestic
society
and
to
that
improvement
in
the
condition
of
women
which
plays
such
a
great

in

of

whatever
opinion
may
be
formed
of
chivalry
it
is
impossible
to
deny
the
influence
which
this
institution
exercised
on
private
life
in
the
middle
ages
it
considerably
modified
custom
by
bringing
the
stronger
sex
to
respect
and
defend
the
weaker
these
warriors
who
were
both
simple
and
externally
rough
and
coarse
required
association
and
intercourse
with
women
to
soften
them
fig
in
taking
women
and
helpless
widows
under
their
protection
they
were
necessarily
more
and
more
thrown
in
contact
with
them
a
deep
feeling
of
veneration
for
woman
inspired
by
christianity
and
above
all
by
the
worship
of
the
virgin
mary
ran
throughout
the
songs
of
the
troubadours
and
produced
a
sort
of
sentimental
reverence
for
the
gentle
sex
which
culminated
in
the
authority
which
women
had
in
the
courts
of
love
fig
we
have
now
reached
the
reign
of
philip
augustus
that
is
to
say
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
this
epoch
is
remarkable
not
only
for
its
political
history
but
also
for
its
effect
on
civilisation
christianity
had
then
considerably
influenced
the
world
arts
sciences
and
letters
animated
by
its
influence
again
began
to
appear
and
to
add
charms
to
the
leisure
of
private
life
the
castles
were
naturally
the
first
to
be
affected
by
this
poetical
and
intellectual
regeneration
although
it
has
been
too
much
the
custom
to
exaggerate
the
ignorance
of
those
who
inhabited
them
we
are
too
apt
to
consider
the
warriors
of
the
middle
ages
as
totally
devoid
of
knowledge
and
as
hardly
able
to
sign
their
names
as
far
as
the
kings
and
princes
are
concerned
this
is
quite
an
error
for
many
of
the
knights
composed
poems
which
exhibit
evidence
of
their
high
literary
culture
it
was
in
fact
the
epoch
of
troubadours
who
might
be
called
professional
poets
and
actors
who
went
from
country
to
country
and
from
castle
to
castle
relating
stories
of
good
king
artus
of
brittany
and
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
repeating
historical
poems
of
the
great
emperor
charlemagne
and
his
followers
these
minstrels
were
always
accompanied
by
jugglers
and
instrumentalists
who
formed
a
travelling
troop
fig
having
no
other
mission
than
to
amuse
and
instruct
their
feudal
hosts
after
singing
a
few
fragments
of
epics
or
after
the
lively
recital
of
some
ancient
fable
the
jugglers
would
display
their
art
or
skill
in
gymnastic
feats
or
conjuring
which
were
the
more
appreciated
by
the
spectators
in
that
the
latter
were
more
or
less
able
to
compete
with
them
these
wandering
troops
acted
small
comedies
taken
from
incidents
of
the
times
sometimes
too
the
instrumentalists
formed
an
orchestra
and
dancing
commenced
it
may
be
here
remarked
that
dancing
at
this
epoch
consisted
of
a
number
of
persons
forming
large
circles
and
turning
to
the
time
of
the
music
or
the
rhythm
of
the
song
at
least
the
dances
of
the
nobles
are
thus
represented
in
the
mss
of
the
middle
ages
to
these
amusements
were
added
games
of
calculation
and
chance
the
fashion
for
which
had
much
increased
and
particularly
such
games
as
backgammon
draughts
and
chess
to
which
certain
knights
devoted
all
their
leisure
from
the
reign
of
philip
augustus
a
remarkable
change
seems
to
have
taken
place
in
the
private
life
of
kings
princes
and
nobles
although
his
domains
and
revenues
had
always
been
on
the
increase
this
monarch
never
displayed
in
ordinary
circumstances
at
least
much
magnificence
the
accounts
of
his
private
expenses
for
the
years
and
have
been
preserved
which
enable
us
to
discover
some
curious
details
bearing
witness
to
the
extreme
simplicity
of
the
court
at
that
period
the
household
of
the
king
or
royal
family
was
still
very
small
one
chancellor
one
chaplain
a
squire
a
butler
a
few
knights
of
the
temple
and
some
were
the
only
officers
of
the
palace
the
king
and
princes
of
his
household
only
changed
apparel
three
times
during

in

paris
the
children
of
the
king
slept
in
sheets
of
serge
and
their
nurses
were
dressed
in
gowns
of
woollen
stuff
called
the
royal
cloak
which
was
of
scarlet
was
jewelled
but
the
king
only
wore
it
on
great
ceremonies
at
the
same
time
enormous
expenses
were
incurred
for
implements
of
war
arrows
helmets
with
visors
chariots
and
for
the
whom
the

kept
in
his
pay
louis

personally
kept
up
almost
similar
habits
the
sire
de
joinville
tells
us
in
his
chronicles
that
the
holy
king
on
his
return
from
his
first
crusade
in
order
to
repair
the
damage
done
to
his
treasury
by
the
failure
of
this
expedition
would
no
longer
wear
costly
furs
nor
robes
of
scarlet
and
contented
himself
with
common
stuffs
trimmed
with
he
nevertheless
did
not
diminish
the
officers
of
his
household
which
had
already
become
numerous
and
being
no
doubt
convinced
that
royalty
required
magnificence
he
surrounded
himself
with
as
much
pomp
as
the
times
permitted
under
the
two
philips
his
successors
this
magnificence
increased
and
descended
to
the
great
vassals
who
were
soon
imitated
by
the
knights
bannerets
there
seemed
to
be
a
danger
of
luxury
becoming
so
great
and
so
general
in
all
classes
of
feudal
society
that
in
an
order
of
the
king
was
issued
regulating
in
the
minutest
details
the
expenses
of
each
person
according
to
his
rank
in
the
state
or
the
fortune
which
he
could
prove
but
this
law
had
the
fate
of
all
such
enactments
and
was
either
easily
evaded
or
was
only
partially
enforced
and
that
with
great
difficulty
another
futile
attempt
to
put
it
in
practice
was
made
in
when
the
splendour
of
dress
of
equipages
and
of
table
had
become
still
greater
and
more
ruinous
and
had
descended
progressively
to
the
bourgeois
and
merchants
it
must
be
stated
in
praise
of
philip
le
bel
fig
that
notwithstanding
the
failure
of
his
attempts
to
arrest
the
progress
of
luxury
he
was
not
satisfied
with
making
laws
against
the
extravagances
of
his
subjects
for
we
find
that
he
studied
a
strict
economy
in
his
own
household
which
recalled
the
austere
times
of
philip
augustus
thus
in
the
curious
regulations
relating
to
the
domestic
arrangements
of
the
palace
the
queen
jeanne
de
navarre
was
only
allowed
two
ladies
and
three
maids
of
honour
in
her
suite
and
she
is
said
to
have
had
only
two
carriages
one
for
herself
and
the
other
for
these
ladies
in
another
place
these
regulations
require
that
a

specially
appointed
should

it
can

be
shown
that
the
example

royalty
was
followed
not

by

also
in

for

as
for

richness
of

and
it
may
be
asserted
that
the
luxury
which
was
displayed
in

of
the
nobility
was
the
evidence
if
not
the
resuit
of
a
great
social
revolution
in
the
manners
and
customs
of
private
life
at
the

fourteenth

there
lived
a
noble
of

named
geoffroy

had

age
he
resolved
that
considering

dangers
which
might

them
in

inexperience

beauty
he
would
compose
for

the

his

is
to
begin
the
day
with
prayer
and
in
order
to
give
greater
weight
to
his
counsel
he
relates
the
following
anecdote
a
noble
had
two
daughters
the
one
was
pious
always
saying
her
prayers
with
devotion
and
regularly
attending
the
services
of
the
church
she
married
an
honest
man
and
was
most
happy
the
other
on
the
contrary
was
satisfied
with
hearing
low
mass
and
hurrying
once
or
twice
through
the
lord
prayer
after
which
she
went
off
to
indulge
herself
with
sweetmeats
she
complained
of
headaches
and
required
careful
diet
she
married
a
most
excellent
knight
but
one
evening
taking
advantage
of
her
husband
being
asleep
she
shut
herself
up
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
palace
and
in
company
with
the
people
of
the
household
began
eating
and
drinking
in
the
most
riotous
and
excessive
manner
the
knight
awoke
and
surprised
not
to
find
his
wife
by
his
side
got
up
and
armed
with
a
stick
betook
himself
to
the
scene
of
festivity
he
struck
one
of
the
domestics
with
such
force
that
he
broke
his
stick
in
pieces
and
one
of
the
fragments
flew
into
the
lady
eye
and
put
it
out
this
caused
her
husband
to
take
a
dislike
to
her
and
he
soon
placed
his
affections
elsewhere

i
will
relate
a
story
on
this
subject
respecting
a
bourgeoise
of
guyenne
and
the
sire
de
beaumanoir
the
lady
said
to
him
i
come
from
brittany
where
i
saw
my
fine
cousin
your
wife
who
was
not
so
well
dressed
as
the
ladies
of
guyenne
and
many
other
places
the
borders
of
her
dress
and
of
her
bonnet
are
not
in
fashion
the
sire
answered
you
find
fault
with
the
dress
and
cap
of
my
wife
and
as
they
do
not
suit
you
i
shall
take
care
in
future
that
they
are
changed
but
i
shall
be
careful
not
to
choose
them
similar
to
yours
understand
madam
that
i
wish
her
to
be
dressed
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
good
ladies
of
france
and
this
country
and
not
like
those
of
england
it
was
these
last
who
first
introduced
into
brittany
the
large
borders
the
bodices
opened
on
the
hips
and
the
hanging
sleeves
i
remember
the
time
and
saw
it
myself
and
i
have
little
respect
for
women
who
adopt
these
fashions
respecting
the
high
which
cause
women
to
resemble
stags
who
are
obliged
to
lower
their
heads
to
enter
a
wood
the
knight
relates
what
took
place
in
at
the
fête
of
marguerite
there
was
a
young
and
pretty
woman
there
quite
differently
dressed
from
the
others
every
one
stared
at
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
wild
beast
one
respectable
lady
approached
her
and
said
friend
what
do
you
call
that
fashion
she
answered
is
called
the
gibbet
dress
but
that
is
not
a
fine
name
answered
the
old
lady
very
soon
the
name
of
got
known
all
round
the
room
and
every
one
laughed
at
the
foolish
creature
who
was
thus
bedecked
this
did
in
fact
owe
its
name
to
its
summit
which
resembled
a
gibbet
these
extracts
from
the
work
of
this
honest
knight
suffice
to
prove
that
the
customs
of
french
society
had
as
early
as
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
taken
a
decided
character
which
was
to
remain
subject
only
to
modifications
introduced
at
various
historical
periods
amongst
the
customs
which
contributed
most
to
the
softening
and
elegance
of
the
feudal
class
we
must
cite
that
of
sending
into
the
service
of
the
sovereign
for
some
years
all
the
youths
of
both
sexes
under
the
names
of
varlets
pages
squires
and
maids
of
honour
no
noble
of
whatever
wealth
or
power
ever
thought
of
depriving
his
family
of
this
apprenticeship
and
its
accompanying
chivalric
education
up
to
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
the
number
of
domestic
officers
attached
to
a
castle
was
very
limited
we
have
seen
for
instance
that
philip
augustus
contented
himself
with
a
few
servants
and
his
queen
with
two
or
three
maids
of
honour
under
louis
ix
this
household
was
much
increased
and
under
philippe
le
bel
and
his
sons
the
royal
household
had
become
so
considerable
as
to
constitute
quite
a
large
assemblage
of
young
men
and
women
under
charles
the
household
of
queen
isabella
of
bavaria
alone
amounted
to
persons
without
counting
the
almoner
the
chaplains
and
clerks
of
the
chapel
who
must
have
been
very
numerous
since
the
sums
paid
to
them
amounted
to
the
large
amount
of
four
hundred
and
sixty
francs

taken
a
much
wider
range
for
the
first
families
of
the
french
nobility
were
most
eager
to
get
their
children
admitted
into
the
royal
household
either
to
attend
on
the
king
or
queen
or
at
any
rate
on
one
of
the
princes
of
the
royal
blood
anne
of
brittany
particularly
gave
special
attention
to
her
female
attendants
fig
she
was
the
first
says
brantôme
in
his
work
on
illustrious
women
who
began
to
form
the
great
court
of
ladies
which
has
descended
to
our
days
for
she
had
a
considerable
retinue
both
of
adult
ladies
and
young
girls
she
never
refused
to
receive
any
one
on
the
contrary
she
inquired
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
court
if
they
had
any
daughters
ascertained
who
they
were
and
asked
for
them
it
was
thus
that
the
admiral
de
graville
fig
confided
to
the
good
queen
the
education
of
his
daughter
anne
who
at
this
school
of
the
court
of
ladies
became
one
of
the
most
distinguished
women
of
her
day
the
same
queen
as
duchess
of
brittany
created
a
company
of
one
hundred
breton
gentlemen
who
accompanied
her
everywhere
they
never
failed
says
the
author
of
illustrious
women
when
she
went
to
mass
or
took
a
walk
to
await
her
return
on
the
little
terrace
of
blois
which
is
still
called
the
aux
she
gave
it
this
name
herself
for
when
she
saw
them
she
said
are
my
bretons
on
the
perch
waiting
for
me
we
must
not
forget
that
this
queen
who
became
successively
the
wife
of
charles
viii
and
of
louis
had
taken
care
to
establish
a
strict
discipline
amongst
the
young
men
and
women
who
composed
her
court
she
rightly
considered
herself
the
guardian
of
the
honour
of
the
former
and
of
the
virtue
of
the
latter
therefore
as
long
as
she
lived
her
court
was
renowned
for
purity
and
politeness
noble
and
refined
gallantry
and
was
never
allowed
to
degenerate
into
imprudent
amusements
or
licentious
and
culpable
intrigues
unfortunately
the
moral
influence
of
this
worthy
princess
died
with
her
although
the
court
of
france
continued
to
gather
around
it
almost
every
sort
of
elegance
and
although
it
continued
during
the
whole
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
most
polished
of
european
courts
notwithstanding
the
great
external
and
civil
wars
yet
it
afforded
at
the
same
time
a
sad
example
of
laxity
of
morals
which
had
a
most
baneful
influence
on
public
habits
so
much
so
that
vice
and
corruption
descended
from
class
to
class
and
contaminated
all
orders
of
society
if
we
wished
to
make
investigations
into
the
private
life
of
the
lower
orders
in
those
times
we
should
not
succeed
as
we
have
been
able
to
do
with
that
of
the
upper
classes
for
we
have
scarcely
any
data
to
throw
light
upon
their
sad
and
obscure
history
bourgeois
and
peasants
were
as
we
have
already
shown
long
included
together
with
the
miserable
class
of
serfs
a
herd
of
human
beings
without
individuality
without
significance
who
from
their
birth
to
their
death
whether
isolated
or
collectively
were
the
property
of
their
masters
what
must
have
been
the
private
life
of
this
degraded
multitude
bowed
down
under
the
most
tyrannical
and
humiliating
dependence
we
can
scarcely
imagine
it
was
in

a
purely
material
existence

left
scarcely

thus
that
the

situated
in

was
named
to
be
attached
to

confided

will
and
the
royal
treasure
his
grandson
made
a
point
of
following
his
grandsire

and
louis
ix
showed
the
same
appreciation
for
the
new
element
which
the
parisian
bourgeoisie
was
about
to
establish
in
political
life
by
making
the
bourgeois
etienne
boileau
one
of
his
principal
ministers
of
police
and
the
bourgeois
jean
sarrazin
his
chamberlain
under
these
circumstances
the
whole
bourgeoisie
gloried
in
the
marks
of
distinction
conferred
upon
their
representatives
and
during
the
following
reign
the
ladies
of
this
class
proud
of
their
immense
fortunes
but
above
all
proud
of
the
municipal
powers
held
by
their
families
bedecked
themselves
regardless
of
expense
with
costly
furs
and
rich
stuffs
notwithstanding
that
they
were
forbidden
by
law
to
do
so
then
came
an
outcry
on
the
part
of
the
nobles
and
we
read
as
follows
in
an
edict
of
philippe
le
bel
who
inclined
less
to
the
bourgeoisie
than
to
the
nobles
and
who
did
not
spare
the
former
in
matters
of
taxation
no

have
a

nor
wear

stones
or
crowns
of

being

prelates

six

and
for
his
wife
one
worth
sixteen
sous

the
most
the
sou
which
was
but
nominal
money
may
be
reckoned
as
representing
twenty
francs
and
the
denier
one
franc
but
allowance
must
be
made
for
the
enormous
difference
in
the
value
of
silver
which
would
make
twenty

the
thirteenth
century
represent
upwards
of
two

these

were
so
little
or
so
carelessly
observed
that
all
the
successors
of
philippe
le

thought
it
necessary

them
and
indeed
charles
one
century
later
was
obliged
to
censure
the
excess
of
luxury
in
dress
by
an
edict
which
was
however
no
better
enforced
than
the
rest
it
has
been
shown
to
the
said
lord
the
king
charles
vii
that
of
all
nations
of
the
habitable
globe
there
are
none
so
changeable
outrageous
and
excessive
in
their
manner
of
dress
as
the
french
nation
and
there
is
no
possibility
of
discovering
by
their
dress
the
state
or
calling
of
persons
be
they
princes
nobles
bourgeois
or
working
men
because
all
are
allowed
to
dress
as
they
think
proper
whether
in
gold
or
silver
silk
or
wool
without
any
regard
to
their
calling
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
rich
merchant
of
valenciennes
went
to
the
court
of
the
king
of
france
wearing
a
cloak
of
furs
covered
with
gold
and
pearls
seeing
that
no
one
offered
him
a
cushion
he
proudly
sat
on
his
cloak
on
leaving
he
did
not
attempt
to
take
up
the
cloak
and
on
a
servant
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
he
remarked
it
is
not
the
custom
in
my
country
for
people
to
carry
away
their
cushions
with
them
respecting
a
journey
made
by
philippe
le
bel
and
his
wife
jeanne
de
navarre
to
the
towns
of
bruges
and
ghent
the
historian
jean
mayer
relates
that
jeanne
on
seeing
the
costly
array
of
the
bourgeois
of
those
two
rich
cities
exclaimed
i
thought
i
was
the
only
queen
here
but
i
see
more
than
six
hundred
in
spite
of
the
laws
the
parisian
bourgeoisie
soon
rivalled
the
flemish
in
the
brilliancy
of
their
dress
thus
in
the
second
half
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
famous
christine
de
pisan
relates
that
having
gone
to
visit
the
wife
of
a
merchant
during
her
confinement
it
was
not
without
some
amazement
that
she
saw
the
sumptuous
furniture
of
the
apartment
in
which
this
woman
lay
in
bed
fig
the
walls
were
hung
with
precious
tapestry
of
cyprus
on
which
the
initials
and
motto
of
the
lady
were
embroidered
the
sheets
were
of
fine
linen
of
rheims
and
had
cost
more
than
three
hundred
pounds
the
quilt
was
a
new
invention
of
silk
and
silver
tissue
the
carpet
was
like
gold
the
lady
wore
an
elegant
dress
of
crimson
silk
and
rested
her
head
and
arms
on
pillows
ornamented
with
buttons
of
oriental
pearls
it
should
be
remarked
that
this
lady
was
not
the
wife
of
a
large
merchant
such
as
those
of
venice
and
genoa
but
of
a
simple
retail
dealer
who
was
not
above
selling
articles
for
four
sous
such
being
the
case
we
need
not
be
surprised
that
christine
should
have
considered
the
anecdote
worthy
of
being
immortalised
in
a
book
it
must
not
however
be
assumed
that
the
sole
aim
of
the
bourgeoisie
was
that
of
making
a
haughty
and
pompous
display
this
is
refuted
by
the
testimony
of
the
ménagier
de
paris
a
curious
anonymous
work
the
author
of
which
must
have
been
an
educated
and
enlightened
bourgeois
the
ménagier
which
was
first
published
by
the
baron
jérôme
pichon
is
a
collection
of
counsels
addressed
by
a
husband
to
his
young
wife
as
to
her
conduct
in
society
in
the
world
and
in
the
management
of
her
household
the
first
part
is
devoted
to
developing
the
mind
of
the
young
housewife
and
the
second
relates
to
the
arrangements
necessary
for
the
welfare
of
her
house
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
comparatively
trifling
duties
relating
to
the
comforts
of
private
life
which
devolved
on
the
wife
were
not
so
numerous
in
those
days
as
they
are
now
but
on
the
other
hand
they
required
an
amount
of
practical
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
housewife
which
she
can
nowadays
dispense
with
under
this
head
the
ménagier
is
full
of
information
after
having
spoken
of
the
prayers
which
a
christian
woman
should
say
morning
and
evening
the
author
discusses
the
great
question
of
dress
which
has
ever
been
of
supreme
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
female
sex
know
dear
sister
the
friendly
name
he
gives
his
young
wife
that
in
the
choice
of
your
apparel
you
must
always
consider
the
rank
of
your
parents
and
mine
as
also
the
state
of
my
fortune
be
respectably
dressed
without
devoting
too
much
study
to
it
without
too
much
plunging
into
new
fashions
before
leaving
your
room
see
that
the
collar
of
your
gown
be
well
adjusted
and
is
not
put
on
crooked

then
he
dilates
on
the
characters
of
women
which
are
too
often
wilful
and
unmanageable
on
this
point
for
he
is
not
less
profuse
in
examples
than
the
chevalier
de
he
relates
an
amusing
anecdote
worthy
of
being
repeated
and
remembered
i
have
heard
the
bailiff
of
tournay
relate
that
he
had
found
himself
several
times
at
table
with
men
long
married
and
that
he
had
wagered
with
them
the
price
of
a
dinner
under
the
following
conditions
the
company
was
to
visit
the
abode
of
each
of
the
husbands
successively
and
any
one
who
had
a
wife
obedient
enough
immediately
without
contradicting
or
making
any
remark
to
consent
to
count
up
to
four
would
win
the
bet
but
on
the
other
hand
those
whose
wives
showed
temper
laughed
or
refused
to
obey
would
lose
under
these
conditions
the
company
gaily
adjourned
to
the
abode
of
robin
whose
wife
called
marie
had
a
high
opinion
of
herself
the
husband
said
before
all
repeat
after
me
what
i
shall
say
sire
say
one
two
three
but
by
this
time
marie
was
out
of
patience
and
said
seven
and
twelve
and
fourteen
why
you
are
making
a
fool
of
me
so
that
husband
lost
his
wager
the
company
next
went
to
the
house
of
maître
jean
whose
wife
agnescat
well
knew
how
to
play
the
lady
jean
said
after
me
one

answered
agnescat
disdainfully
so
he
lost
his
wager

then
tried
and
said
to
dame
tassin
one
upstairs
she
answered
you

to
teach

i
am
not
a
child
another
said
away
with
you
you
must
have
lost

or
similar
words
which
made
the
husbands
lose
their
wagers
those
on
the
contrary
who
had
wives
gained
their
wager
and
went
away
joyful
this
amusing
quotation
suffices
to
show
that
the
author
of
the
ménagier
de
paris
wished
to
adopt
a
jocose
style
with
a
view
to
enliven
the
seriousness
of
the
subject
he
was
advocating
the
part
of
his
work
in
which
he
discusses
the
administration
of
the
house
is
not
less
worthy
of
attention
one
of
the
most
curious
chapters
of
the
work
is
that
in
which
he
points
out
the
manner
in
which
the
young
bourgeoise
is
to
behave
towards
persons
in
her
service
rich
people
in
those
days
in
whatever
station
of
life
were
obliged
to
keep
a
numerous
retinue
of
servants
it
is
curious
to
find
that
so
far
back
as
the
period
to
which
we
allude
there
was
in
paris
a
kind
of
servants
registry
office
where
situations
were
found
for
from
the
country
the
bourgeois
gave
up
the
entire
management
of
the
servants
to
his
wife
but
on
account
of
her
extreme
youth
the
author
of
the
work
in
question
recommends
his
wife
only
to
engage
servants
who
shall
have
been
chosen
by
dame
agnes
the
nun
whom
he
had
placed
with
her
as
a
kind
of
governess
or
companion
before
engaging
them
he
says
know
whence
they
come
in
what
houses
they
have
been
if
they
have
acquaintances
in
town
and
if
they
are
steady
discover
what
they
are
capable
of
doing
and
ascertain
that
they
are
not
greedy
or
inclined
to
drink
if
they
come
from
another
country
try
to
find
out
why
they
left
it
for
generally
it
is
not
without
some
serious
reason
that
a
woman
decides
upon
a
change
of
abode
when
you
have
engaged
a
maid
do
not
permit
her
to
take
the
slightest
liberty
with
you
nor
allow
her
to
speak
disrespectfully
to
you
if
on
the
contrary
she
be
quiet
in
her
demeanour
honest
modest
and
shows
herself
amenable
to
reproof
treat
her
as
if
she
were

choose
among

qualified
for

the

a

the
manner
in
which
the
author
concludes
his
instruction
proves
his
kindness
of
heart
as
well
as
his
benevolence
if
one
of
your
servants
fall
sick
it
is
your
duty
setting
everything
else
aside
to
see
to
his
being
cured
it
was
thus
that
a
bourgeois
of
the
fifteenth
century
expressed
himself
and
as
it
is
clear
that
he
could
only
have
been
inspired
to
dictate
his
theoretical
teachings
by
the
practical
experience
which
he
must
have
gained
for
the
most
part
among
the
middle
class
to
which
he
belonged
we
must
conclude
that
in
those
days
the
bourgeoisie
possessed
considerable
knowledge
of
moral
dignity
and
social
propriety
it
must
be
added
that
by
the
side
of
the
merchant
and
working
bourgeoisie
who
above
all
owed
their
greatness
to
the
high
functions
of
the
municipality
the
parliamentary
bourgeoisie
had
raised
itself
to
power
and
that
from
the
fourteenth
century
it
played
a
considerable
part
in
the
state
holding
at
several
royal
courts
at
different
periods
and
at
last
almost
hereditarily
the
highest
magisterial
positions
the
very
character
of
these
great
offices
of
president
or
of
parliamentary
counsel
barristers
proves
that
the
holders
must
have
had
no
small
amount
of
intellectual
culture
in
this
way
a
refined
taste
was
created
among
this
class
which
the
protection
of
kings
princes
and
lords
had
alone
hitherto
encouraged
we
find
for
example
the
grosliers
at
lyons
the

thous
and
seguiers
in
paris
regardless
of
their
bourgeois
origin

often

made

the

reserved

in
we
thus
see
that
the
bourgeoisie
especially
of
paris
gradually
took
a
more
prominent
position
in
history
and
became
so
grasping
after
power
that
it
ventured
at
a
period
which
does
not
concern
us
here
to
aspire
to
every
sort
of
distinction
and
to
secure
an
important
social
standing
what
had
been
the
exception
during
the
sixteenth
century
became
the
rule
two
centuries
later
we
will
now
take
a
glance
at
the
agricultural
population
fig
who
as
we
have
already
stated
were
only
emancipated
from
serfdom
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
whatever
might
have
been
formerly
the
civil
condition
of
the
rural
population
everything
leads
us
to
suppose
that
there
were
no
special
changes
in
their
private
and
domestic
means
of
existence
from
a
comparatively
remote
period
down
to
almost
the
present
time
a
small
poem
of
the
thirteenth
century
entitled
de
au
vilain
gives
a
clear
though
rough
sketch
of
the
domestic
state
of
the
peasantry
strange
as
it
may
seem
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
with
a
few
exceptions
resulting
from
the
progress
of
time
it
would
not
be
difficult
even
at
the
present
day
to
find
the
exact
type
maintained
in
the
country

farthest
away

we
gather
from
this
poem
which
must
be
considered
an
authentic
and
most
interesting
document
that
the
or

of
the
villain
comprised
three
distinct

the

the

those
of
the

of

poorest

of

in

we
may
fairly
infer
that
there
must
be
a
great
deal
which
is
analogous
between
the

themselves
of
the
two
periods

that
in

of

the
cows
had
a
free
right
of
pasture
in
such
and
such
a
meadow
or
the
sheep
on
such
and
such
a
ridge
then
there
is

and
the
speculator
who
converts
all
his
possessions
into
ready
money
so
as
to
purchase
grain
against
a
bad
season
but
of
course
the
harvest
turns
out
to
be
excellent
and
he
does
not
make
a
farthing
but
runs
away
to
conceal
his
ruin
and
rage
there
is
also
the
villain
who
leaves
his
plough
to
become
a
poacher
there
are
many
other
curious
examples
which
altogether
tend
to
prove

there

to
which
they

generally
subject
the
rural
population
had
their
days
of
rest
and
amusement
which
were
then
much
more
numerous
than
at
present
at
that
period
the
festivals
of
the

were
frequent
and
rigidly
kept
and
as
each
of
them
was
the
pretext
for
a
forced
holiday
from

labour
the
peasants
thought

nothing
after

quite
rivalled

the

or
evening
parties
which
are
still
the
custom
in
most
of
the
french
provinces
and
which
are
of
very
ancient
origin
formed
important
events
in
the
private
lives
of
the
peasants
it
was
at
these
that
the
strange
legends
and
vulgar
superstitions
which
so
long
fed
the
minds
of
the
ignorant
classes
were
mostly
created
and
propagated
it
was
there
that
those
extraordinary
and
terrible
fairy
tales
were
related
as
well
as
those
of
magicians
witches
spirits
it
was
there
that
the
matrons
whose
great
age
justified
their
experience
insisted
on
proving
by
absurd
tales
that
they
knew
all
the
marvellous
secrets
for
causing
happiness
or
for
curing
sickness
consequently
in
those
days
the
most
enlightened
rustic
never
for
a
moment
doubted
the
truth
of
witchcraft
in
fact
one
of
the
first
efforts
at
printing
was
applied
to
reproducing
the
most
ridiculous
stories
under
the
title
of
the
evangile
des
conuilles
ou
quenouilles
and
which
had
been
previously
circulated
in
manuscript
and
had
obtained
implicit
belief
the
author
of
this
remarkable
collection
asserts
that
the
matrons
in
his
neighbourhood
had
deputed
him
to
put
together
in
writing
the
sayings
suitable
for
all
conditions
of
rural
life
which
were
believed
in
by
them
and
were
announced
at
the
wakes
the
absurdities
and
childish
follies
which
he
has
dared
to
register
under
their
dictation
are
almost
incredible
the
evangile
des
quenouilles
which
was
as
much
believed
in
as
holy
writ
tells
us
amongst
other
secrets
which
it
contains
for
the
advantage
of
the
reader
that
a
girl
wishing
to
know
the
christian
name
of
her
future
husband
has
but
to
stretch
the
first
thread
she
spins
in
the
morning
across
the
doorway
and
that
the
first
man
who
passes
and
touches
the
thread
will
necessarily
have
the
same
name
as
the
man
she
is
destined
to
marry
another
of
the
stories
in
this
book
was
that
if
a
woman
on
leaving
off
work
on
saturday
night
left
her
distaff
loaded
she
might
be
sure
that
the
thread
she
would
obtain
from
it
during
the
following
week
would
only
produce
linen
of
bad
quality
which
could
not
be
bleached
this
was
considered
to
be
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
germans
wore
coloured
shirts
and
it
was
known
that
the
women
never
unloaded
their
distaffs
from
saturday
to
monday
should
a
woman
enter
a
to
milk
her
cows
without
saying
god
and
bridget
bless
you
she
was
thought
to
run
the
risk
of
the
cows
kicking
and
breaking

and
spilling

anselme

this
good
man
possessed
a
moderate
amount
of
knowledge
was
a
goodish
grammarian
a
musician
somewhat
of
a
sophist
and
rather
given
to
picking
holes
in

some

anselme
conversation
is
also
given
and
after
beginning
by
describing
in
glowing
terms
the
bygone
days
which
he
and
his
contemporaries
had
seen
and
which
he
stated
to
be
very
different
to
the

he
goes
on
to
say
i
must
own
my
good
old
friends
that
i
look
back
with
pleasure
on
our
young
days
at
all
events
the
mode
of
doing
things
in
those
days
was
very
superior
and
better
in
every
way
to
that
of
the
present
o
happy
days
o
fortunate
times
when
our
fathers
and
grandfathers
whom
may
god
absolve
were
still
among
us
as
he
said
this
he
would
raise
the
rim
of
his
hat
he
contented
himself
as
to
dress
with

well
lined

there

change

read
that
from

time
of

down
to
that
of
the
excellent
author

even
later
the

people
found

we

over

obtained
from

kingdom

then
trace
the

principally
inhabited

thick

on

is
even
possible
that
the
veneration
in
which
they
held
the
oak
had
no
other
origin
this
primitive
food
continued
in
use
at
least
in
times
of
famine
up
to
the
eighth
century
and
we
find
in
the
regulations
of
chrodegand
that
if
in
consequence
of
a
bad
year
the
acorn
or
became
scarce
it
was
the
bishop
duty
to
provide
something
to
make
up
for
it
eight
centuries
later
when
rené
du
bellay
bishop
of

came
to

to
francis
the
fearful
poverty
of

he
informed

bread
was
cooked
under
the
embers
the
use
of
ovens
was
introduced
into
europe
by
the
romans
who
had
found
them
in
egypt
but
notwithstanding
this
importation
the
old
system
of
cooking
was
long
after
employed
for
in
the
tenth
century
raimbold
abbot
of
the
monastery
of
thierry
near
rheims
ordered
in
his
will
that
on
the
day
of
his
death
bread
cooked
under
the
embers
should
be
given
to
his
monks
by
feudal
law
the
lord
was
bound
to
bake
the
bread
of
his
vassals
for
which
they
were
taxed
but
the
latter
often
preferred
to
cook
their
flour
at
home
in
the
embers
of
their
own
hearths
rather
than
to
carry
it
to
the
public
oven

it
must
be
stated
that
the
custom
of
leavening
the
dough
by
the
addition
of
a
ferment
was
not
universally
adopted
amongst
the
ancients
for
this
reason
as
the
dough
without
leaven
could
only
produce
a
heavy
and
indigestible
bread
they
were
careful
in
order
to
secure
their
loaves
being
thoroughly
cooked
to
make
them
very
thin
these
loaves
served
as
plates
for
cutting
up
the
other
food
upon
and
when
they
thus
became
saturated
with
the
sauce
and
gravy
they
were
eaten
as
cakes
the
use
of
the
small
crusty
loaves
which
were
at
first
called
and
subsequently
remained
long
in
fashion
even
at
the
most
splendid
banquets
thus
in
the
dauphin
of
vienna
humbert
had
besides
the
small
white
bread
four
small
loaves
to
serve
as
at
table
the
ménagier
de
paris
mentions
pains
de
half
a
foot
in
diameter
and
four
fingers
deep
and
froissart
the
historian
also
speaks
of
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
out
the
exact
period
at
which
leavening
bread
was
adopted
in
europe
but
we
can
assert
that
in
the
middle
ages
it
was
anything
but
general
yeast
which
according
to
pliny
was
already
known
to
the
gauls
was
reserved
for
pastry
and
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
that
the
bakers
of
paris
used
it
for
bread
at
first
the
trades
of
miller
and
baker
were
carried
on
by
the
same
person
figs
and
the
man
who
undertook
the
grinding
of
the
grain
had
ovens
near
his
mill
which
he
let
to
his
lord
to
bake
bread
when
he
did
not
confine
his
business
to
persons
who
sent
him
their
corn
to
grind
illustration
fig
the
from
an
engraving
of
the
sixteenth
century
by
j
amman
at
a
later
period
public
bakers
established
themselves
who
not
only
baked
the
loaves
which
were
brought
to
them
already
kneaded
but
also
made
bread
which
they
sold
by
weight
and
this
system
was
in
existence
until
very
recently
in
the
provinces
charlemagne
in
his
capitulaires
statutes
fixed
the
number
of
bakers
in
each
city
according
to
the
population
and
louis
relieved
them
as
well
as
the
millers
from
taking
their
turn
at
the
watch
so
that
they
might
have
no
pretext
for
stopping
or
neglecting
their
work
which
he
considered
of
public
utility
nevertheless
bakers
as
a
body
never
became
rich
or
powerful
figs
and
it
is
pretty
generally
believed
that
the
name
of
baker
originated
from
the
fact
that
the
shape
of
the
loaves
made
at
one
time
was
very
like
that
of
a
round
ball
but
loaves
varied
so
much
in
form
quality
and
consequently
in
name
that
in
his
dictionary
of
obscure
words
the
learned
du
cange
specifies
at
least
twenty
sorts
made
during
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
and
amongst
them
may
be
mentioned

one
of

would
suffice
for
a
man
of

usually
added

on

they
only
mixed

held
of

they
were

to
contain
so
many

great
facilities
were
offered
for
breeding

whose
special
liking
for

is
well
known
thus
the

caused
numerous

to
be
fed
on

domains
both
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
their
own
tables
as
well
as
for
the
fairs
and
markets
at
a
subsequent
period
it
became
the
custom
for
each
household

in

to
rear
and
fatten
a
pig
which
was
killed
and
salted
at

this
custom
still
exists

who
had
not
two

three
young
pigs
during

these

were

to
roam
in

to
keep
clean
by

up

sorts
which
was
thrown
out

of

the
effect
that
breeding

was
forbidden

centuries
resisted

many
others
on

subject
which
followed
it

find
under

a
license
was
issued
to
the
executioner
empowering
him
to
capture
all
the
stray

which
he
could
find
in

take
them
to
the

he
should
receive
either
five

of
the
privilege
attached
to
the
popular
legend
of
their
patron
who
was

objected
to
this
order
and
long
after
maintained
the
exclusive
right
of
allowing
their

to

of
the
capital
the
obstinate
determination
with
which
every
one
tried
to
evade
the
administrative
laws
on
this
subject
is
explained
in
fact
by
the
general
taste
of
the
french
nation
for
pork
this
taste
appears
somewhat
strange
at

to
deceive
the

less
expensive

the
higher
price

was
the
origin
of
the
proverb
which
described
a
cheat
as
a
dealer

other
places
butchers
were
far
from
acquiring
the

importance
which
they
did
in
france

belgium
figs
and
where
much
more
meat
was
consumed
than
in
spain
italy
or
even
in
germany
nevertheless
in
almost
all
countries
there
were
certain
regulations
sometimes
eccentric
but
almost
always
rigidly
enforced
to
ensure
a
supply
of
meat
of
the
best
quality
and
in
a
healthy
state
in
england
for
instance
butchers
were
only
allowed
to
kill
bulls
after
they
had
been
baited
with
dogs
no
doubt
with
the
view
of
making
the
flesh
more
tender
at
mans
it
was
laid
down
in
the
trade
regulations
that
no
butcher
shall
be
so
bold
as
to
sell
meat
unless
it
shall
have
been
previously
seen
alive
by
two
or
three
persons
who
will
testify
to
it
on
oath
and
anyhow
they
shall
not
sell
it
until
the
persons
shall
have
declared
it
wholesome
to
the
many
regulations
affecting
the
interests
of
the
public
must
be
added
that
forbidding
butchers
to
sell
meat
on
days
when
abstinence
from
animal
food
was
ordered
by
the
church
these
regulations
applied
less
to
the
vendors
than
to
the
consumers
who
by
disobeying
them
were
liable
to
fine
or
imprisonment
or
to
severe
corporal
punishment
by
the
whip
or
in
the
pillory

that
clément
marot

imprisoned
and
nearly
burned

permission
for

who
was

eighty
years
of

bishop
of
paris
only
granted
dispensation
on
condition
that
the
old
lady
should
take
her
meals
in
secret
and
out
of
sight
of
every
one
and
should
still
fast
on
fridays
in
a
certain
town
says
brantôme
there
had
been
a
procession
in
lent
a
woman
who
had
assisted
at
it
barefooted
went
home
to
dine
off
a
quarter
of
lamb
and
a
ham
the
smell
got
into
the
street
the
house
was
entered
the
fact
being
established
the
woman
was
taken
and
condemned
to
walk
through
the
town
with
her
quarter
of
lamb
on
the
spit
over
her
shoulder
and
the
ham
hung
round
her
neck
this
species
of
severity
increased
during
the
times
of
religious
dissensions
erasmus
says
he
who
has
eaten
pork
instead
of
fish
is
taken
to
the
torture

parricide
an
edict
of
henry
ii
forbade
the
sale
of
meat
in
lent
to
persons
who
should
not
be
furnished
with
a
doctor
certificate
charles
ix
forbade
the
sale
of
meat
to
the
huguenots
and
it
was
ordered
that
the
privilege
of
selling
meat
during
the
time
of
abstinence
should
belong
exclusively
to
the
hospitals
orders
were
given
to
those
who
retailed
meat
to
take
the
address
of
every
purchaser
although
he
had
presented
a
medical
certificate
so
that
the
necessity
for
his
eating
meat
might
be
verified
subsequently
the
medical
certificate
required
to
be
endorsed
by
the
priest
specifying
what
quantity
of
meat
was
required
even
in
these
cases
the
use
of
meat
alone
was
granted
pork
poultry
and
game
being
strictly
forbidden
a
monk
of
the
abbey
of
cluny
once
went
on
a
visit
to
his
relations
on
arriving
he
asked
for
food
but
as
it
was
a
fast
day
he
was
told
there
was
nothing
in
the
house
but
fish
perceiving
some
chickens
in
the
yard
he
took
a
stick
and
killed
one
and
brought
it
to
his
relations
saying
this
is
the
fish
which
i
shall
eat
eh
but
my
son
they
said
have
you
dispensation
from
fasting
on
a
friday
no
he
answered
but
poultry
is
not
flesh
fish
and
fowls
were
created
at
the
same
time
they
have
a
common
origin
as
the
hymn
which
i
sing
in
the
service
teaches
me
this
simple
legend
belongs
to
the
tenth
century
and
notwithstanding
that
the
opinion
of
this
benedictine
monk
may
appear
strange
nowadays
yet
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
was
only
conforming
himself
to
the
opinions
laid
down
by
certain
theologians
in
the
council
of
decided
that
such
delicate
nourishment
could
scarcely
be
called
mortification
as
understood
by
the
teaching
of
the
church
in
consequence
of
this
an
order
was
issued
forbidding
the
monks
to
eat
poultry
except
during
four
days
at
easter
and
four
at
christmas
but
this
prohibition
in
no
way
changed
the
established
custom
of
certain
parts
of
christendom
and
the
faithful
persisted
in
believing
that
poultry
and
fish
were
identical
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
and
accordingly
continued
to
eat
them
indiscriminately
we
also
see
in
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
thomas
aquinas
who
was
considered
an
authority
in
questions
of
dogma
and
of
faith
ranking
poultry
amongst
species
of
aquatic
origin
eventually
this
palpable
error
was
abandoned
but
when
the
church
forbade
christians
the
use
of
poultry
on
fast
days
it
made
an
exception
out
of
consideration
for
the
ancient
prejudice
in
favour
of
teal
widgeon
and
also
two
or
three
kinds
of
small
amphibious
quadrupeds
hence
probably
arose
the
general
and
absurd
beliefs
concerning
the
origin
of
teal
which
some
said
sprung
from
the
rotten
wood
of
old
ships
others
from
the
fruits
of
a
tree
or
the
gum
on
whilst
others
thought
they
came
from
a
shell
analogous
to
that
of
the
oyster
and
mussel
as
far
back
as
modern
history
can
be
traced
we
find
that
a
similar
mode
of
fattening
poultry
was
employed
then
as
now
and
was
one
which
the
gauls
must
have
learnt
from
the
romans
amongst
the
charges
in
the
households
of
the
kings
of
france
one
item
was
that
which
concerned
the

which
according
to
an
edict
of
louis

name

a
subsequent
period
this
name
was
given
to
breeders
and
dealers
in
poultry
fig
the
ménagier
tells
as
that
as
is
the
present
practice
chickens
were
fattened
by
depriving
them
of
light
and
liberty
and
gorging
them
with
succulent
food

the
poultry
yards

repute

know
that
under
the
roman
rule
the
gauls
carried
on
a
considerable
trade
in
fattened
geese
this
trade
ceased
when
gaul
passed
to
new
masters
but
the
breeding
of
geese
continued
to
be
carefully
attended
to

many
centuries

were
more
highly
prized
than
any
other
description

poultry

were
driven

fields

was
avoided
owing
to
the
little
nourishment
it
contained
and
its
indigestibility

some
french

returned

also
for
dressing
chickens
when

amongst
the
monks
the
dishes
were
prepared
with
oil
but
as
in
some
countries
oil
was
apt
to
become
very
expensive
and
the
supply
even
to
fail
totally
animal
fat
or
lard
had
to
be
substituted
at
a
subsequent
period
the
church
authorised
the
use
of
butter
and
milk
but
on
this
point
the
discipline
varied
much
in
the
fourteenth
century
charles
king
of
france
having
asked
pope
gregory
xi
for
a
dispensation
to
use
milk
and
butter
on
fast
days
in
consequence
of
the
bad
state
of
his
health
brought
on
owing
to
an
attempt
having
been
made
to
poison
him
the
supreme
pontiff
required
a
certificate
from
a
physician
and
from
the
king
confessor
he
even
then
only
granted
the
dispensation
after
imposing
on
that
christian
king
the
repetition
of
a
certain
number
of
prayers
and
the
performance
of
certain
pious
deeds
in
defiance
of
the
severity
of
ecclesiastical
authority
we
find
in
the
journal
of
a
bourgeois
of
paris
that
in
the
unhappy
reign
of
charles
vi
for
want
of
oil
butter
was
eaten
in
lent
the
same
as
on
ordinary
days
in
queen
anne
duchess
of
brittany
in
order
to
obtain
permission
from
the
pope
to
eat
butter
in
lent
represented
that
brittany
did
not
produce
oil
neither
did
it
import
it
from
southern
countries
many
northern
provinces
adopted
necessity
as
the
law
and
having
no
oil
used
butter
and
thence
originated
that
famous
toast
with
slices
of
bread
and
butter
which
formed
such
an
important
part
of
flemish
food
these
papal
dispensations
were
however
only
earned
at
the
price
of
prayers
and
alms
and
this
was
the
origin
of
the
pour
le
that
is
for
butter
which
are
still
to
be
seen
in
some
of
the
flemish
churches

salted
in

to
preserve
it
or
to
send
it

places
but
this
process
which
is
so
simple

so
natural
dates
no

from
very
ancient
times
it
was
particularly
practised
by
the
normans

enclosed

proves
to
us
that
the

with
regard
to

were
not

the
emperor
in
one
of
his
travels
alighted
suddenly
and
without
being
expected
at
the
house
of
a
bishop
it
was
on
a
friday
the
prelate
had
no
fish
and
did
not
dare
to
set
meat
before
the
prince
he
therefore
offered
him
what
he
had
got
some
boiled
corn
and
green
cheese
charles
ate
of
the
cheese
but
taking
the
green
part
to
be
bad
he
took
care
to
remove
it
with
his
knife
the
bishop
seeing
this
took
the
liberty
of
telling
his
guest
that
this
was
the
best
part
the
emperor
tasting
it
found
that
the
bishop
was
right
and
consequently
ordered
him
to
send
him
annually
two
cases
of
similar
cheese
to
the
bishop
answered
that
he
could
easily
send
cheeses
but
he
could
not
be
sure
of
sending
them
in
proper
condition
because
it
was
only
by
opening
them
that
you
could
be
sure
of
the
dealer
not
having
deceived
you
in
the
quality
of
the
cheese
said
the
emperor
sending
them
cut
them
through
the
middle
so
as
to
see
if
they
are
what
i
want
you
will
only
have
to
join
the
two
halves
again
by
means
of
a
wooden
peg
and
you
can
then
put
the
whole
into

made
at
the
village
of
chaillot
near

was
much
appreciated
in
the
capital
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries

cheeses
of
champagne
and
of

several

cheeses
the
names
of
which
it
would
now
be
difficult
to
trace
owing
to
their
frequent
changes
during
four
hundred
years
but
according
to
the
gallic
author
of
this
collection
a
cheese
to
be
presentable
at
table
was
required
to
possess
certain
qualities
in

was
only
towards
the
twelfth
century
that
the
idea
was
entertained
of
bringing
oysters
to

not

much
later

is

henry

beer
is
not
only
one
of
the
oldest
fermenting
beverages
used
by
man
but
it
is
also
the
one
which
was
most
in
vogue
in
the
middle
ages
if
we
refer
to
the
tales
of
the
greek
historians
we
find
that
the
gauls
who
like
the
egyptians
attributed
the
discovery
of
this
refreshing
drink
to
their
god
osiris
had
two
sorts
of
beer
one
called
made
with
honey
and
intended
for
the
rich
the
other
called
in
which
there
was
no
honey
and
which
was
made
for
the
poor
but
pliny
asserts
that
beer
in
gallie
was
called
and
the
grain
employed
for
making
it
this
testimony
seems
true
as
from
or
comes
the
name
brewer
and
from
the
generic
name
by
which
beer
was
known
for
centuries
and
which
only
lately
fell
into
disuse

domitian
ordered
all
the
vines
in
gaul
to
be
uprooted
so
as
to
make
room
for
corn
this
rigorous
measure
must
have
caused
beer
to
become
even
more
general
and
although
two
centuries
later
probus
allowed
vines
to
be
replanted
the
use
of
beverages
made
from
grain
became
an
established
custom
but
in
time
whilst
the
people
still
only
drank
those
who
were
able
to
afford
it
bought
wine
and
drank
it
alternately
with
beer
however
as
by
degrees
the
vineyards
increased
in
all
places
having
a
suitable
soil
and
climate
the
use
of
beer
was
almost
entirely
given
up
so
that
in
central
gaul
wine
became
so
common
and
cheap
that
all
could
drink
it
in
the
northern
provinces
where
the
vine
would
not
grow
beer
naturally
continued
to
be
the
national
beverage
fig
in
the
time
of
charlemagne
for
instance
we
find
the
emperor
wisely
ordered
that
persons
knowing
how
to
brew
should
be
attached
to
each
of
his
farms
everywhere
the
monastic
houses
possessed
breweries
but
as
early
as
the
reign
of
louis
there
were
only
a
very
few
breweries
in
paris
itself
and
in
spite
of
all
the
privileges
granted
to
their
corporation
even
these
were
soon
obliged
to
leave
the
capital
where
there
ceased
to
be
any
demand
for
the
produce
of
their
industry
they
reappeared
in
probably
in
consequence
of
the
political
and
commercial
relations
which
had
become
established
between
paris
and
the
rich
towns
of
the
flemish
bourgeoisie
and
then
either
on
account
of
the
dearness
of
wine
or
the
caprice
of
fashion
the
consumption
of
beer
again
became
so
general
in
france
that
according
to
the
journal
bourgeois
de
paris
it
produced
to
the
revenue
more
than
wine
it
must
be
understood
however
that
in
times
of
scarcity
as
in
the
years
and
brewing
was
temporarily
stopped
and
even
forbidden
altogether
on
account
of
the
quantity
of
grain
which
was
thereby
withdrawn
from
the
food
supply
of
the
people

beer
was
made

but
at
a
later
period
all
sorts
of
grain
was
indiscriminately
used
and
it
was
only
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
that
adding
the
flower

of
hops
to
the
oats

formed

was
thought
of

boileau

edited
in

thirteenth
century
shows
us
that
besides
the
another
sort
of
beer
was
known
which
was
called
this
name
we
should
imagine
was
derived
from
the
two
german
words
which
mean
good
beer
and
was
of
a
stronger
description
than
the
ordinary
this
idea
is
proved
by
the
picards
and
flemish
people
calling
it
double
beer
in
any
case
it
is
from
the
word
that
the
familiar
expression
of
to
tipple
is
derived
in
fact
there
is
hardly
any
sort
of
mixture
or
ingredient
which
has
not
been
used
in
the
making
of
beer
according
to
the
fashions
of
the
different
periods
when
on
the
return
from
the
crusades
the
use
of
spice
had
become

as

the

thrown

the
english
sugared
it
and
the
germans
salted
it
and
at
times
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
put
darnel
into
it
at
the
risk
of
rendering
the
mixture
poisonous
the
object
of
these
various
mixtures
was
naturally
to
obtain
beers
which
became
so
much
in
fashion
that
to
describe
the
want
of
merit
of
persons
or
the
lack
of
value
in
anything
no
simile
was
more
common
than
to
compare
them
to
small
beer
nevertheless
more
delicate
and
less
blunted
palates
were
to
be
found
which
could
appreciate
beer
sweetened
simply
with
honey
or
scented
with
ambergris
or
raspberries
it
is
possible
however
that
these
compositions
refer
to
mixtures
in
which
beer
the
produce
of
fermented
grain
was
confounded
with
hydromel
or
fermented
honey
both
these
primitive
drinks
claim
an
origin
equally
remote
which
is
buried
in
the
most
distant
periods
of
history
and
they
have
been
used
in
all

to
twelve
parts
of
water
scented
with
herbs

allowed
to
ferment

a
month

six
weeks
this
beverage
which
in
the
customs
and
statutes
of
the
order
of
cluny
is
termed
the
sweetest
beverage
and
which
must
have
been
both
agreeable

in

fifteenth
century
the
parisians
were
satisfied
with
pouring
water
on
apples

the

was
naturalised
in

has
been
a
question
which
in

most
careful
research
remains
unsolved
the
most
plausible
opinion
is
that
which
attributes
the

having
imported

colony
who
founded

devote
themselves
to

labour

they
do
not
parch
the

the

gascony
nor

to
the
head
like
those
of
orleans
and
nor

they

like
those

this
is
also
the
opinion
of
baccius
who
in
his
latin
treatise
on
the
natural
history
of
wines
asserts
that
the
wines
of
paris
are
in
no
way
inferior
to
those
of
any
other
district
of
the
kingdom
these
thin
and
sour
wines
so
much
esteemed
in
the
first
periods
of
monarchy
and
so
long
abandoned
first
lost
favour
in
the
reign
of

preferred
the
strong
and
stimulating
productions
of
the
south
notwithstanding
the
great
number
of
excellent
wines
made
in
their
own

in
the
thirteenth

generally
the
malmsey
which
was
drunk
in
france
was
an
artificial
preparation
which
had
neither
the
colour
nor
taste
of
the
cyprian
wine
olivier
de
serres
tells
us
that
in
his
time
it
was
made
with
water
honey
clary
juice
beer
grounds
and
brandy
at
first
the
same
name
was
used
for
the
natural
wine
mulled
and
spiced
which
was
produced
in
the
island
of
madeira
from
the
grapes
which
the
portuguese
brought
there
from
cyprus
in
the
reputation
which
this
wine
acquired
in
europe
induced
francis
to
import
some
vines
from
greece
and
he
planted
fifty
acres
with
them
near
fontainebleau
it
was
at
first
considered
that
this
plant
was
succeeding
so
well
that
there
were
hopes
says
olivier
de
serres
that
france
would
soon
be
able
to
furnish
her
own
malmsey
and
greek
wines
instead
of
having
to
import
them
from
abroad
it
is
evident
however
that
they
soon
gave
up
this
delusion
and
that
for
want
of
the
genuine
wine
they
returned
to
artificial
beverages
such
as
or
cooked
wine
which
had
at
all
times
been
cleverly
prepared
by
boiling
down
new
wine
and
adding
various
aromatic
herbs
to
it
many
wines
were
made
under
the
name
of
which
were
merely
infusions
of
wormwood
myrtle
hyssop
rosemary
mixed
with
sweetened
wine
and
flavoured
with
honey
the
most
celebrated
of
these
beverages
bore
the
pretentious
name
of
nectar
those
composed
of
spices
asiatic
aromatics
and
honey
were
generally
called
white
wine
a
name
indiscriminately
applied
to
liquors
having
for
their
bases
some
slightly
coloured
wine
as
well
as
to
the
hypocras
which
was
often
composed
of
a
mixture
of
foreign
liqueurs
this
hypocras
plays
a
prominent
part
in
the
romances
of
chivalry
and
was
considered
a
drink
of
honour
being
always
offered
to
kings
princes
and
nobles

solemn
entry

given
to
drinks
composed
of
the
juices
of
certain
fruits
and
in
which

were
in
no

used
these
were

also
the
made

which
was
so
extolled
by

we
must
also
mention
the
sour
wines
which
were
made
by
pouring
water
on

sold
to
the

and
which
most
assuredly
has
not
much
improved
since
olden
times
it
was
about
the
thirteenth
century
that
brandy
first
became
known
in
france
but
it
does
not
appear
that
it
was
recognised
as
a
liqueur
before
the

celebrated
physician
arnauld
de
villeneuve
who
wrote
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
to
whom
credit
has
wrongly
been
given
for
inventing
brandy
employed
it
as
one
of
his
remedies
and
thus
expresses
himself
about
it
who
would
have
believed
that
we
could
have
derived
from
wine
a
liquor

neither
resembles

period
when
so
many
doctors
alchemists

men
made
it
their

to
try
to
discover
that
marvellous
golden
fluid
which
was
to
free
the
human
race
of
all
its
original
infirmities
the
discovery
of
such
an
elixir
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
attention
of
all
such
manufacturers
of
panaceas
it
was
therefore
under
the
name
of
that
brandy
first
became
known
to
the
world
a
name
improperly
given
to
it
implying
as
it
did
that
it
was
of
mineral
origin
whereas
its
beautiful
golden
colour
was
caused
by
the
addition
of
spices
at
a
later
period
when
it
lost
its
repute
as
a
medicine
they
actually
sprinkled
it
with
pure
gold
leaves
and
at
the
same
time
that
it
ceased
to
be
exclusively
considered
as
a
remedy
it
became
a
favourite
beverage
it
was
also
employed
in
distilleries
especially
as
the
basis
of
various
strengthening
and
exciting
liqueurs
most
of
which
have
descended
to
us

coming
from
monasteries

others
from
châteaux

they

been
manufactured
the

the
french
word

originally
have
signified
a
soup
composed
of
vegetables
and
herbs
from
the

garden
but
from
the
remotest
times
it
was
applied
to
soups
in
general
as
the
gauls
according
to
athenæus
generally
ate
their
meat
boiled
we
must
presume
that
they
made
soup
with
the
water
in
which
it
was
cooked
it
is
related
that
one
day
gregory

tours
was
sitting
at

of

offered
him

sort
of
soup
made
from
the
odds

ends
of
the

in
those
days
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
hot
soup
formed
an
indispensable
part
of
the

and
that

took
it
at

twice
a

is
the

of
a

christian
the
cooking
apparatus
of
that
period
consisted
of
a
whole
glittering
array
of
cauldrons
saucepans
kettles
and
vessels
of
red
and
yellow
copper
which
hardly
sufficed
for
all
the
rich
soups
for
which
france
was
so
famous
thence
the
old
proverb

but
besides
these
soups
which
were
in
fact
looked
upon
as
common
and
without
spice
a
number
of
dishes
were
served
under
the
generic
name
of
soup
which
constituted
the
principal
luxuries
at
the
great
tables
in
the
fourteenth
century
but
which
do
not
altogether
bear
out
the
names

we

them

there

the

were

very
expensive
several
being
served
at
the

time
and
in
order
to
please
the
eye
as
well
as
the
taste
they
were
generally
made
of

it
is
possible
that
even
now
this
kind
of
soup
might
find
some
favour
but
we
can
not
say
the
same
for
those
made
with
mustard
millet
verjuice
and
a
number
of
others
much
in
repute
at
that
period
for
we
see
in
rabelais
that
the
french
were
the
greatest
soup
eaters
in
the
world
and
boasted
to
be
the
inventors
of
seventy
sorts
we
have
already
remarked
that
broths
were
in
use
at
the
remotest
periods
for
from
the
time
that
the
practice
of
boiling
various
meats
was
first
adopted
it
must
have
been
discovered
that
the
water
in
which
they
were
so
boiled
became
savoury
and
nourishing
in
the
time
of
the
great
king
francis
says
noël
du
fail
in
his
contes
in
many
places
the
saucepan
was
put
on
to
the
table
on
which
there
was
only
one
other
large
dish
of
beef
mutton
veal
and
bacon
garnished
with
a
large
bunch
of
cooked
herbs
the
whole
of
which
mixture
composed
a
porridge
and
a
real
restorer
and
elixir
of
life
from
this
came
the
adage
soup
in
the
great
pot
and
the
dainties
in
the
at
one
time
they
made
what
they
imagined
to
be
strengthening
broths
for
invalids
though
their
virtue
must
have
been
somewhat
delusive
for
after
having
boiled
down
various
materials
in
a
close
kettle
and
at
a
slow
fire
they
then
distilled
from
this
and
the
water
thus
obtained
was
administered
as
a
sovereign
remedy
the
common
sense
of
bernard
palissy
did
not
fail
to
make
him
see
this
absurdity
and
to
protest
against
this
ridiculous
custom
take
a
capon
he
says
a
partridge
or
anything
else
cook
it
well
and
then
if
you
smell
the
broth
you
will
find
it
very
good
and
if
you
taste
it
you
will
find
it
has
plenty
of
flavour
so
much
so
that
you
will
feel
that
it
contains
something
to
invigorate
you
distil
this
on
the
contrary
and
take
the
water
then
collected
and
taste
it
and
you
will
find
it
insipid
and
without
smell
except
that
of
burning
this
should
convince
you
that
your
restorer
does
not
give
that
nourishment
to
the
weak
body
for
which
you
recommend
it
as
a
means
of
making
good
blood
and
restoring
and
strengthening
the
spirits
the
taste
for
broths
made
of
flour
was
formerly
almost
universal
in
france
and
over
the
whole
of
europe
it
is
spoken
of
repeatedly
in
the
histories
and
annals
of
monasteries
and
we
know
that
the
normans
who
made
it
their
principal
nutriment
were
surnamed
they
were
indeed
almost
like
the
romans
who
in
olden
times
before
their
wars
with
eastern
nations
gave
up
making
bread
and
ate
their
corn
simply
boiled
in
water
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
broths
and
soups
were
made
with
and
mixed
wheats
the
pure
wheat

was
steeped
in
milk
seasoned
with
sugar
saffron
honey
sweet
wine
or
aromatic
herbs
and
sometimes
butter
fat
and
yolks
of
eggs
were
added
it
was
on
account
of
this
that
the
bread
of
the
ancients
so
much
resembled
cakes
and
it
was
also
from
this
fact
that
the
art
of
the
pastrycook
took
its
rise
wheat
made
into
gruel
for
a
long
time
was
an
important
ingredient
in
cooking
being
the
basis
of
a
famous
preparation
called
which
was
a
of
milk
made
creamy
by
the
addition
of
yolks
of
eggs
and
which
served
as
a
liquor
in
which
to
roast
meats
and
fish
there
were
besides
several
sorts
of
all
equally
esteemed
and
taillevent
recommended
the
following
receipt
which
differs
from
the
one
above
given
first
boil
your
wheat
in
water
then
put
into
it
the
juice
or
gravy
of
fat
meat
or
if
you
like
it
better
milk
of
almonds
and
by
this
means
you
will
make
a
soup
fit
for
fasts
because
it
dissolves
slowly
is
of
slow
digestion
and
nourishes
much
in
this
way
too
you
can

and

must
not

to

the

is
attributed
to
hunters
and
which

as
acting

voracious

fig
the
custom
of
introducing
salads
after
roasts
was
already
established
in
the
fifteenth

however
a

of
whatever
sort
was
never
brought
to

state

seventeenth

we
have
already
stated
that
the
taste
for
spices
much
increased
in
europe
after
the
crusades
and
in
this
rapid
historical
sketch
of
the
food
of
the
french
people
in
the
middle
ages
it
must
have
been
observed
to
what
an
extent
this
taste
had
become
developed
in
france
fig
this
was
the
origin
of
sauces
all
or
almost
all
of
which
were
highly
spiced
and
were
generally
used
with
boiled
roast
or
grilled
meats
a
few
of
these
sauces
such
as
the
yellow
the
green
and
the
became
so
necessary
in
cooking
that
numerous
persons
took
to
manufacturing
them
by
wholesale
and
they
were
hawked
in
the
streets
of
paris
these
were
first
called
then
and
when
louis
xii
united
them
in
a
body
as
their
business
had
considerably
increased
they
were
termed
distillers
of
brandy
and
spirits
of
wine
and
from
a
sideboard
illustration

but
very
soon
the
corporation
became
divided
no
doubt
from
the
force
of
circumstances
and
on
one
side
we
find
the
distillers
and
on
the
other
the
and
cooks
or
as
they
were
called
because
when
they
carried
on
their
business
of
cooking
they
covered
their
dishes
with
a
that
is
a
cope
or
tin
cover

so
as
to
keep
them
warm
the
list
of
sauces
of
the
fourteenth
century
given
by
the
ménagier
de
paris
is
most
complicated
but
on
examining
the
receipts
it
becomes
clear
that
the
variety
of
those
preparations
intended
to
sharpen
the
appetite
resulted
principally
from
the
spicy
ingredients
with
which
they
were
flavoured
and
it
is
here
worthy
of
remark
that
pepper
in
these
days
exclusively
obtained
from
america
was
known
and
generally
used
long
before
the
time
of
columbus
it
is
mentioned
in
a
document
of
the
time
of
clotaire
iii
and
it
is
clear
therefore
that
before
the
discovery
of
the
new
world
pepper
and
spices
were
imported
into
europe
from
the
east
mustard
which
was
an
ingredient
in
so
many
dishes
was
cultivated
and
manufactured
in
the
thirteenth
century
in
the
neighbourhood
of
dijon
and
angers
according
to
a
popular
adage
garlic
was
the
medicine
of
peasants
for
a
long
time
greatly
appreciated
which
was
a
sauce
made
of
garlic
and
sold
ready
prepared
in
the
streets
of
paris
the
custom
of
using
anchovies
as
a
flavouring
is
also
very
ancient
this
was
also
done
with
and
two
sorts
of
which
consisted
of
fishes
eggs
chiefly
mullet
and
sturgeon
properly
salted
or
dried
and
mixed
with
fresh
or
pickled
olives
the
olives
for
the
use
of
the
lower
orders
were
brought
from
languedoc
and
provence
whereas
those
for
the
rich
were
imported
from
spain
and
some
from
syria
it
was
also
from
the
south
of
france
that
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
was
supplied
with
olive
oil
for
which
to
this
day
those
provinces
have
preserved
their
renown
but
as
early
as
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
oil
of
walnuts
was
brought
from
the
centre
of
france
to
paris
and
this
although
cheaper
was
superseded
by
oil
extracted
from
the
poppy
truffles
though
known
and
esteemed
by
the
ancients
disappeared
from
the
gastronomie
collection
of
our
forefathers
it
was
only
in
the
fourteenth
century
that
they
were
again
introduced
but
evidently
without
a
knowledge
of
their
culinary
qualities
since
after
being
preserved
in
vinegar
they
were
soaked
in
hot
water
and
afterwards
served
up
in
butter
we
may
also
here
mention
sorrel
and
the
common
mushroom
which
were
used
in
cooking
during
the
middle
ages
on
the
strength
of
the
old
proverb
sugar
has
never
spoiled
sauce
sugar
was
put
into
all
sauces
which
were
not
and
generally
some
perfumed
water
was
added
to
them
such
as
this
was
made
in
great
quantities
by
exposing
to
the
sun
a
basin
full
of
water
covered
over
by
another
basin
of
glass
under
which
was
a
little
vase
containing
this
was
added
to
all
stews
pastries
and
beverages
it
is
very
doubtful
as
to
the
period
at
which
white
lump
sugar
became
known
in
the
west
however
in
an
account
of
the
house
of
the
dauphin
viennois
mention
is
made
of
white
sugar
and
the
author
of
the
ménagier
de
paris
frequently
speaks
of
this
white
sugar
which
before
the
discovery
or
rather
colonisation
of
america
was
brought
ready
refined
from
the
grecian
islands
and
especially
from
candia

formed

another

the
mode
of
manufacturing
it
by
artificial
means
in
order
to
render
the
taste
more
pungent
and
the
quality
better
is
very
ancient
it
is
needless
to
state
that
it
was
scented
by
the
infusion
of
herbs
or
flowers
roses
elder
cloves
but
it
was
not
much
before
the
sixteenth
century
that
it
was
used
for
pickling
herbs
or
fruits
and
vegetables
such
as
gherkins
onions
cucumber
purslain
salt
which
from
the
remotest
periods
was
the
condiment
and
the
trade
in
which
had
been
free
up
to
the
fourteenth
century
became
from
that
period
the
subject
of
repeated
taxation
the
levying
of
these
taxes
was
a
frequent
cause
of
tumult
amongst
the
people
who
saw
with
marked
displeasure
the
exigencies
of
the
excise
gradually
raising
the
price
of
an
article
of
primary
necessity
we
have
already
mentioned
times
during
which
the
price
of
salt
was
so
exorbitant
that
the
rich
alone
could
put
it
in
their
bread
thus
in
the
reign
of
francis
it
was
almost
as
dear
as
indian
spices
sweet
dishes

in
the
fourteenth
century
the
first
courses
of
a

were
called

walnuts
figs

peaches
grapes
filberts
spices
and
white
or
red
at
the
de

or
some
other
light
pastry
were
introduced
which
were
eaten
with
the

which
was
served

the
guests
after
having
washed
their
hands
and
said
grace

passed

of
spices
different
from
those
which
had
appeared
at

and
intended
specially
to
assist
the
digestion

for
this
object
they
must
have
been
much
needed
considering
that
a
repast
lasted
several
hours
whilst
eating
these
spices
they
drank
grenache
malmsey
or
aromatic
wines
fig
it
was
only
at
the
banquets
and
great
repeats
that
sweet

appeared
and
they
seem
to
have
been
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
exhibiting
the
power
of
the
imagination

the
talent

any

is
that

a

that
my
lord
of

occupying

was
in

of
his
rank
served
on

the
custom
for

was
seated

the

up
the

for
the

in

the
different
provisions
necessary
for
food
are

were
chosen
purchased
and
paid
for
by
one

of
these
officials
assisted
by
the
cooks
the
dishes
prepared
by
the
cooks
were
placed
by
the
help

the
esquires
on
dressers
in
the
kitchen
until
the
moment
of
serving
thence
they
were
carried
to
the

let
us
imagine
a
vast
hall
hung
with
tapestries
and
other
brilliant
stuffs
the
tables
are
covered
with
fringed

strewn
with
odoriferous
herbs

orders
is
occupied
with
nothing
but
drawing
wine
from
the
casks
at
that
time
wine
was
not
bottled
and
they
drew
directly
from
the
cask
the
amount
necessary
for
the
consumption
the
dishes

there
was
a

entirely
composed
of
the

in

and
of

these
consisted
of

this
is
what
froissard
calls

which
was
at
an
earlier
period
called
because
it
was
the
custom
to
wash
the
hands
before
sitting
down
to

well
as

in
ewers
of

and
delicately
wrought
metals
by
pages
or
squires
who
handed
them
to
the
ladies
in
silver
basins
it
was
at
about
this
period
that
is
in
the
times
of
chivalry
that
the
custom
of
placing
the
guests
by
couples
was
introduced
generally
a
gentleman
and
lady
each
couple
having
but
one
cup
and
one
plate
hence
the
expression
to
eat
from
the
same
plate
historians
relate
that
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
at
certain
gala
feasts
the
dishes
were
brought
in
by
servants
in
full
armour
mounted
on
caparisoned
horses
but
this
is
a
custom
exclusively
attached
to
chivalry
as
early
as
those
days
powerful
and
ingenious
machines
were
in
use
which
lowered

the
story
above
or
raised
from
that
below
tables
which
were
made
to
disappear
after
use
as
if
by
enchantment
at
that
period
the
table
service
of
the
wealthy
required
a
considerable
staff
of
retainers
and
varlets
and
at
a
later
period
this
number
was
much
increased
thus
for
instance
when
louis
of
orleans
went
on
a
diplomatic
mission
to
germany
from
his
brother
charles
this
prince
in
order
that
france
might
be
worthily
represented
abroad
raised
the
number
of
his
household
to
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
persons
of
whom
about
one
hundred
were
retainers
and
table
attendants
olivier
de
la
marche
who
in
his
mémoires
gives
the
most
minute
details
of
the
ceremonial
of
the
court
of
charles
the
bold
duke
of
burgundy
tells
us
that
the
table
service
was
as
extensive
as
in
the
other
great
princely
houses
this
extravagant
and
ruinous
pomp
fell
into
disuse
during
the
reigns
of
louis
charles
and
louis
but
reappeared
in
that
of
francis
i
this
prince
after
his
first
wars
in
italy
imported
the
cookery
and
the
gastronomic
luxury
of
that
country
where
the
art
of
good
living
especially
in
venice
florence
and
rome
had
reached
the
highest
degree
of
refinement
and
magnificence
henry
ii
and
francis
ii
maintained
the
magnificence
of
their
royal
tables
but
after
them
notwithstanding
the
soft
effeminacy
of
the
manners
at
court
the
continued
wars
which
henry
iii
and
charles
ix
had
to
sustain
in
their
own
states
against
the
protestants
and
the
league
necessitated
a
considerable
economy
in
the
households
and
tables
of
those
kings
it
was
only
by
fits
and
starts
says
brantôme
that
one
was
well
fed
during
this
reign
for
very
often
circumstances
prevented
the
proper
preparation
of
the
repasts
a
thing
much
disliked
by
the
courtiers
who
prefer
open
table
to
be
kept
at
both
court
and
with
the
army
because
it
then
costs
them
nothing
henry
iv
was
neither
fastidious
nor
greedy
we
must
therefore
come
down
to
the
reign
of
louis
xiii
to
find
a
vestige
of
the
splendour
of
the
banquets

the
three
distinct
branches
of
an
art
or
it
may
be
called
a
science
which
dates
its
origin
from
the
earliest
times
but
which
was
particularly
esteemed
in
the
middle
ages
and
was
especially
cultivated
in
the
glorious
days
of
chivalry
which
is
the
earliest
is
defined
by
elzéar
blaze
as
the
science
of
snaring
taking
or
killing
one
particular
animal
from
amongst
a
herd
came
next
this
was
not
only
the
art
of
hunting
with
the
falcon
but
that
of
training
birds
of
prey
to
hunt
feathered
game
lastly
fowling
which
according
to
the
author
of
several
works
on
the
subject
we
are
discussing
had
originally
no
other
object
than
that
of
protecting
the
crops
and
fruits
from
birds
and
other
animals
whose
nature
it
was
to
feed
on
them
venery
will

first
considered
sportsmen
always
pride
themselves
in
placing
xenophon
the
general
philosopher
and
historian
at
the
head
of
sporting
writers
although
his
treatise
on
the
chase
translated
from
the
greek
into
latin
under
the
title
of
de
venatione
which
gives
excellent
advice
respecting
the
training
of
dogs
only
speaks
of
traps
and
nets

capturing
wild
animals
amongst
the
greeks
arrian
and
oppian
and
amongst
the
romans
gratius
faliscus
and
nemesianus
wrote
on
the
same
subject
their
works
however
except
in
a
few
isolated
or
scattered
passages
do
not
contain
anything
about
venery
properly
so
called
and
the
first
historical
information
on
the
subject
is
to
be
found
in
the
records
of
the
seventh
century
long
after
that
period
however
they
still
hunted
as
it
were
at
random
attacking
the
first
animal
they
met
the
sports
of
charlemagne
for
instance
were
almost
always
of
this
description
on
some
occasions
they
killed
animals
of
all
sorts
by
thousands
after
having
tracked
and
driven
them
into
an
enclosure
composed
of
cloths
or
nets
this
illustrious
emperor
although
usually
at
war
in
all
parts
of
europe
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
hunting
so
much
so
that
it
might
be
said
that
he
rested
himself
by
galloping
through
the
forests
he
was
on
these
occasions
not
only
followed
by
a
large
number
of
huntsmen
and
attendants
of
his
household
but
he
was
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
daughters
mounted
on
magnificent
coursers
and
surrounded
by
a
numerous
and
elegant
court
who
vied
with
each
other
in
displaying
their
skill
and
courage
in
attacking
the
fiercest
animals
it
is
even
stated
that
owes
its
origin
to
a
hunting
adventure
of
charlemagne
the
emperor
one
day
while
chasing
a
stag
required
to
cross
a
brook
which
came
in
his
path
but
immediately
his
horse
had
set
his
foot
in
the
water
he
pulled
it
out
again
and
began
to
limp
as
if
it
were
hurt
his
noble
rider
dismounted
and
on
feeling
the
foot
found
it
was
quite
hot
this
induced
him
to
put
his
hand
into
the
water
which
he
found
to
be
almost
boiling
on
that
very
spot
therefore
he
caused
a
chapel
to
be
erected
in
the
shape
of
a
horse
hoof
the
town
was
afterwards
built
and
to
this
day
the
spring
of
hot
mineral
water
is
enclosed
under
a
rotunda
the
shape
of
which
reminds
one
of
the
old
legend
of
charlemagne
and
his
horse
the
sons
of
charlemagne
also
held
hunting
in
much
esteem
and
by
degrees
the
art
of
venery
was
introduced
and
carried
to
great
perfection
it
was
not
however
until
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
an
anonymous
author
conceived
the
idea
of
writing
its
principal
precepts
in
an
instructive
poem
called
le
dict
de
la
chace
du
cerf
in
another
anonymous
writer
composed
the
livre
du
roy
modus
which
contains
the
rules
for
hunting
all
furred
animals
from
the
stag
to
the
hare
then
followed
other
poets
and
writers
of
french
prose
such
as
gace
de
la
vigne
gaston
phoebus
and
hardouin
lord
of
none
of
these
however
wrote
exclusively
on
venery
but
described
the
different
sports
known
in
their
day
towards
alphonse
king
of
castile
caused
a
book
on
hunting
to
be
compiled
for
his
use
but
it
was
not
so
popular
as
the
instruction
of
gaston
phoebus
fig
if
hunting
with
hounds
is
known
everywhere
by
the
french
name
of
the
chase
it
is
because
the
honour
of
having
organized
it
into
a
system
if
not
of
having
originated
it
is
due
to
the
early
french
sporting
authors
who
were
able
to
form
a
code
of
rules
for
it
this
also
accounts
for
so
many
of
the
technical
terms
now
in
use
in
venery
being
of
french
origin
as
they
are
no
others
than
those
adopted
by
these
ancient
authors
whose
works
so
to
speak
have
perpetuated
them

may
account

these

the
fact

constituted
a
sort

freemasonry

more

the
more

his
setting

huntsmen

after

disabled
numerous

found
himself
face

with

who
alone
dared
to
stand
up
before
him

fierce
combat
ensued
on
the
summit
of
a

were

charles
le

it

said
that
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
companions
of
the
intrepid
monarch
gave
him
the
title
of
magnus
so
from
that
time
king
charles
became
king
this
prince
was
most
jealous
of
his
rights
of
hunting
which
he
would
waive
to
no
one
for
a
long
time
he
refused
permission
to
the
monks
of
the
abbey
of
denis
whom
he
nevertheless
held
in
great
esteem
to
have
some
stags
killed
which
were
destroying
their
forests
it
was
only
on
condition
that
the
flesh
of
these
animals
would
serve
as
food
to
the
monks
of
inferior
order
and
that
their
hides
should
be
used
for
binding
the
missals
that
he
eventually
granted
them
permission
to
kill
the
offending
animals
fig
if
we
pass
from
the
ninth
to
the
thirteenth
century
we
find
that
louis
king
of
france
was
as
keen
a
sportsman
and
as
brave
a
warrior
as
any
of
his
ancestors
he
was
indeed
as
fond
of
hunting
as
of
war
and
during
his
first
crusade
an
opportunity
occurred
to
him
of
hunting
the
lion
as
soon
as
he
began
to
know
the
country
of
cesarea
says
joinville
the
king
set
to
work
with
his
people
to
hunt
lions
so
that
they
captured
many
but
in
doing
so
they
incurred
great
bodily
danger
the
mode
of
taking
them
was
this
they
pursued
them
on
the
swiftest
horses
when
they
came
near
one
they
shot
a
bolt
or
arrow
at
him
and
the
animal
feeling
himself
wounded
ran
at
the
first
person
he
could
see
who
immediately
turned
his
horse
head
and
fled
as
fast
as
he
could
during
his
flight
he
dropped
a
portion
of
his
clothing
which
the
lion
caught
up
and
tore
thinking
it
was
the
person
who
had
injured
him
and
whilst
the
lion
was
thus
engaged
the
hunters
again
approached
the
infuriated
animal
and
shot
more
bolts
and
arrows
at
him
soon
the
lion
left
the
cloth
and
madly
rushed
at
some
other
hunter
who
adopted
the
same
strategy
as
before
this
was
repeated
until
the
animal
succumbed
becoming
exhausted
by
the
wounds
he
had
received

notwithstanding
the
passion
which
this
king
had
for
hunting
he
was
the
first
to
grant
leave
to
the
bourgeoisie
to
enjoy
the
sport
the
condition
he
made
with
them
was
that
they
should
always
give
a
haunch
of
any
animal
killed
to
the
lord
of
the
soil
it
is
to
this
that
we
must
trace
the
origin
of
giving
the
animal
foot
to
the
huntsman
or
to
the
person
who
has
the
lead
of
the
hunting
party
louis
however
did
not
at
all
act
in
this
liberal
manner
and
although
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
the
incessant
wars
and
political
intrigues
in
which
he
was
constantly
engaged
would
have
given
him
no
time
for
amusements
of
this
kind
yet
he
was
nevertheless
the
keenest
sportsman
of
his
day
this
tyrant
of
the
castle
of
who
was
always
miserly
except
in
matters
of
hunting
in
which
he
was
most
lavish
forbade
even
the
higher
classes
to
hunt
under
penalty
of
hanging
to
ensure
the
execution
of
his
severe
orders
he
had
all
the
castles
as
well
as
the
cottages
searched
and
any
net
engine
or
sporting
arm
found
was
immediately
destroyed
his
only
son
the
heir
to
the
throne
was
not
exempted
from
these
laws
shut
up
in
the
castle
of
amboise
he
had
no
permission
to
leave
it
for
it
was
the
will
of
the
king
that
the
young
prince
should
remain
ignorant
of
the
noble
exercises
of
chivalry
one
day
the
dauphin
prayed
his
governor
du
bouchage
with
so
much
earnestness
to
give
him
an
idea
of
hunting
that
this
noble
consented
to
make
an
excursion
into
the
neighbouring
wood
with
him
the
king
however
managed
to
find
it
out
and
du
bouchage
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
his
head
on
his
shoulders
one
of
the
best
ways
of
pleasing
louis
xi
was
to
offer
him
some
present
relating
to
his
favourite
pastime
either
pointers
hounds
falcons
or
varlets
who
were
adepts
in
the
art
of
venery
or
hawking
figs
and
when
the
cunning
monarch
became
old
and
infirm
in
order
to
make
his
enemies
believe
that
he
was
still
young
and
vigorous
he
sent
messengers
everywhere
even
to
the
most
remote
countries
to
purchase
horses
dogs
and
falcons
for
which
according
to
comines
he
paid
large
sums
fig
on
his
death
the
young
prince
charles
succeeded
him
and
he
seems
to
have
had
an
innate
taste
for
hunting
and
soon
made
up
for
lost
time
and
the
privation
to
which
his
father
had
subjected
him
he
hunted
daily
and
generously
allowed
the
nobles
to
do
the
same
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
these
were
not
slow
in
indulging
in
the
privilege
thus
restored
to
them
and
which
was
one
of
their
most
ancient
pastimes
and
occupations
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
those
days
of
small
intellectual
culture
hunting
must
have
been
a
great
if
not
at
times
the
only
resource
against
idleness
and
the
monotony
of
country
life
everything
which
related
to
sport
again
became
the
fashion
amongst
the
youth
of
the
nobility
and
their
chief
occupation
when
not
engaged
in
war
they
continued

the
panther

the
leopard
from

were
used

game
as

was
for
feathered
game
the
mode
of
hunting
with
these
animals
was
as
follows
the
sportsmen
preceded
by
their
dogs
rode
across
country
each
with
a
leopard
sitting
behind
him
on
his
saddle
when
the
dogs
had
started
the
game
the
leopard
jumped
off
the
saddle
and
sprang
after
it
and
as
soon
as
it
was
caught
the
hunters
threw
the
leopard
a
piece
of
raw
flesh
for
which
he
gave
up
the
prey
and
remounted
behind
his
master

the
leopards
which
formed

kept

quite
as
fond
of

as

of

his
innate

for

was
increased
during
his
travels
in

where
he
lived
with
princes
who
displayed
great
splendour
in

carrying

were

he
was
much
pleased
when
ladies
followed
the

amongst
those
who
were
most
inclined
to
share
its
pleasures
its

having
become
very
general
and

being
considered
as
the
most

to
which
persons
could
devote

is
not

henry
who
learned
hunting
in
early
youth
in
the
pyrenees
loved
all
kinds
of
sport
and
above
all
the
most
fatiguing
and
adventurous
pursuits
such
as
those
after
wolves

and
boars
he
never
missed
a
chance
of
hunting
even
when
in
face
of
an
enemy
if
he
knew
a
stag
to
be
near
he
found
time
to
hunt
it
and
we
find
in
the
memoirs
of
sully
that
the
king
hunted
the
day
after
the
famous
battle
of
ivry

day
when
he
was

of
navarre

invited

to

refused

occasion
their
nerves
would
have
been
put

killed
two
of

the
only
point
in
which
louis
xiii
resembled
his
father
was
his
love
of
the
chase
for
during
his
reign
hunting
continued
in
france
as
well
as
in
other
countries
to
be
a
favourite
royal
pastime
we
have
remarked
that
germain
who
at
a
certain
period
was
the
patron
of
sportsmen
made
hunting
his
habitual
relaxation
he
devoted
himself
to
it
with
great
keenness
in
his
youth
before
he
became
bishop
that
is
when
he
was
duke
of
auxerre
and
general
of
the
troops
of
the
provinces
subsequently
when
against
his
will
he
was
raised
to
the
episcopal
dignity
not
only
did
he
give
up
all
pleasures
but
he
devoted
himself
to
the
strictest
religious
life
unfortunately
in
those
days
all
did
not
understand
as
he
did
that
the
duties
of
their
holy
vocation
were
not
consistent
with
these
pastimes
for
in
the
year
we
find
that
councils
and
synods
forbade
priests
to
hunt
in
spite
of
this
however
the
ancient
historians
relate
that
several
noble
prelates
yielding
to
the
customs
of
the
times
indulged
in
hunting
the
stag
and
flying
the
falcon

it
is
related
in
history
that
some
of
the
most
illustrious
popes
were
also
great
lovers
of
the
chase
namely
julius
ii
leo
and
previously
to
them
pius

before
becoming
pope
amongst
other
literary
and
scientific
works
wrote
a
latin
treatise
on
venery
under
his
christian
names
æneas
silvius
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
it
happened
that
sports
formerly
possessed
such
attractions
for
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
in
early
life
they
acquired
the
tastes
and
habits
of
people
of
their
rank
and
they
were
accordingly
extremely
jealous
of
the
rights
of
chase
in
their
domains
although
pope
clement
in
his
celebrated
institutions
called
clémentines
had
formally
forbidden
the
monks
to
hunt
there
were
few
who
did
not
evade
the
canonical
prohibition
by
pursuing
furred
game
and
that
without
considering
that
they
were
violating
the
laws
of
the
church
the
papal
edict
permitted
the
monks
and
priests
to
hunt
under
certain
circumstances
and
especially
where
rabbits
or
beasts
of
prey
increased
so
much
as
to
damage
the
crops
it
can
easily
be
imagined
that
such
would
always
be
the
case
at
a
period
when
the
people
were
so
strictly
forbidden
to
destroy
game
and
therefore
hunting
was
practised
at
all
seasons
in
the
woods
and
fields
in
the
vicinity
of
each
abbey
the
jealous
peasants
not
themselves
having
the
right
of
hunting
and
who
continually
saw
passing
on
his
hunting
excursions
said
with
malice
that
the
monks
never
forgot
to
pray
for
the
success
of
the
litters

might

it

in

esteem
that

to

was

considered
a
noble

by
the
laws

falconry
as
were
all
birds
of
prey
which
could
be
trained
for
purposes
of
sport
all
other
birds
without
distinction
were
declared
and
no
exception
was
made
to
this
rule
by
the
naturalists
of

the

divided
them
into

bird
which
had
been
taken
from

nest
and
the
wild
bird
captured
when
the
education
of
the
former
was
naturally
very
much

easier

they
succeeded
in
taming
both
classes
and
even
the
most
rebellious
were
at
last
subdued
by
depriving
them
of
sleep
by
keeping
away
the
light
from
them
by
coaxing
them
with
the
voice
by
patting
them
by
giving
them
choice
food
regardless
of
his
original
habits
the
bird
was
first
accustomed
to
have
no
fear
of
men
horses
and
dogs
he
was
afterwards
fastened
to
a
string
by
one
leg
and
being
allowed
to
fly
a
short
distance
was
recalled
to
the
lure
where
he
always
found
a
dainty
bit
of
food
after
he
had
been
thus
exercised
for
several
months
a
wounded
partridge
was
let
loose
that
he
might

took

was

was
used

was
tied

were
filed
so
as

prevent
him
from

a
bird
of
great
value
and
was
the
finest
present
that
could
be
made
to
a
lady
to
a
nobleman
or
to
the
king
himself
by
any
one
who
had
received
a
favour
for
instance
the
king
of
france
received
six
birds
from
the
abbot
of
hubert
as
a
token
of
gratitude
for
the
protection
granted
by
him
to
the
abbey
the
king
of
denmark
sent
him
several
as
a
gracious
offering
in
the
month
of
april
the
grand
master
of
malta
in
the
month
of
may
at
court
in
those
days
the
reception
of
falcons
either
in
public
or
in
private
was
a
great
business
and
the
first
trial
of
any
new
birds
formed
a
topic
of
conversation
among
the
courtiers
for
some
time
after
the
arrival
at
court
of
a
from
some
distant
country
was
also
a
great
event
it
is
said
that
louis
xi
gave
orders
that
watch
should
be
kept
night
and
day
to
seize
any
falcons
consigned
to
the
duke
of
brittany
from
turkey
the
plan
succeeded
and
the
birds
thus
stolen
were
brought
to
the
king
who
exclaimed
by
our
holy
lady
of
cléry
what
will
the
duke
francis
and
his
bretons
do

very
angry
at
the

trick

european
princes
vied
with
each
other
in
extravagance
as
regards
falconry
but
this
was
nothing
in
comparison
to
the
magnificence
displayed
in
oriental
establishments
the
count
de
nevers
son
of
philip
the
bold
duke
of
burgundy
having
been
made
prisoner
at
the
battle
of
nicopolis
was
presented
to
the
sultan
bajazet
who
showed
him
his
hunting
establishment
consisting
of
seven
thousand
falconers
and
as
many
huntsmen
the
duke
of
burgundy
on
hearing
this
sent
twelve
white
hawks
which
were
very
scarce
birds
as
a
present
to
bajazet
the
sultan
was
so
pleased
with
them
that
he
sent
him
back
his
son

exchange

the
livre
du
roy
modus
gives
the
most
minute
and
curious
details
on
the
noble
science
of
hawking
for
instance
it
tells
us
that
the
of
the
falcon
was
held
in
such
respect
that
their
utensils
trappings
or
were
never
used
for
other
birds
the
glove
on
which
they
were
accustomed
to
alight
was
frequently
elaborately
embroidered
in
gold
and
was
never
used
except
for
birds
of
their
own
species
in
the
private
establishments
the
leather
hoods
which
were
put
on
their
heads
to
prevent
them
seeing
were
embroidered
with
gold
and
pearls
and
surmounted
with
the
feathers
of
birds
of
paradise
each
bird
wore
on
his
legs
two
little
bells
with
his
owner
crest
upon
them
the
noise
made
by
these
was
very
distinct
and
could
be
heard
even
when
the
bird
was
too
high
in
the
air
to
be
seen
for
they
were
not
made
to
sound
in
unison
they
generally
came
from
italy
milan
especially
being
celebrated
for
their
manufacture
straps
were
also
fastened
to
the
falcon
legs
by
means
of
which
he
was
attached
to
the
perch
at
the
end
of
this
strap
was
a
brass
or
gold
ring
with
the
owner
name
engraved
upon
it
in
the
royal
establishments
each
ring
bore
on
one
side
i
belong
to
the
king
and
on
the
other
the
name
of
the
grand
falconer
this
was
a
necessary
precaution
for
the
birds
frequently
strayed
and
if
captured
they
could
thus
be
recognised
and
returned
the
ownership
of
a
falcon
was
considered
sacred
and
by
an
ancient
barbaric
law
the
stealer
of
a
falcon
was
condemned
to
a
very
curious
punishment
the
unfortunate
thief
was
obliged
to
allow
the
falcon
to
eat
six
ounces
of
the
flesh
of
his
breast
unless
he
could
pay
a
heavy
fine
to
the
owner
and
another
to

his
advantage
to
turn
to
the
side
of
the
king

in

not
to
appear
to
break
his
oath
he
managed
to
be
taken
prisoner
by
the
french
whilst
out
hunting
and
thus
he
sacrificed
his
honour
to
his
personal
interests
it
was
also
due
to
a
hunting
party
that
henry
another
king
of

who
was

henry
escaped
from

on

another
falcon
was
started
from

side
of

which
attacked
the

so
fiercely
that
he
brought
him
down
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
after
the
performance
was
over

the
heron
was
killed

we
shall
conclude
this
chapter
with
a
few
words
on
a
kind
of
sport
which
was
almost
disdained
in
the
middle
ages
the
anonymous
author
of
the
livre
du
roy
modus
called
it
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
pastime
of
the
poor
because
the
poor
who
can
neither
keep
hounds
nor
falcons
to
hunt
or
to
fly
take
much
pleasure
in
it
particularly
as
it
serves
at
the
same
time
as
a
means
of
subsistence
to
many
of
them
in
this
book
which
was
for
a
long
time
the
authority
in
matters
of
sport
generally
we
find
that
nearly
all
the
methods
and
contrivances
now
employed
for
were
known
and
in
use
in
the
middle
ages
in
addition
to
some
which
have
since
fallen
into
disuse
we
accordingly
read
in
the
roy
modus
a
description
of
the
the
mirror
the
the
fig
the
traps
the
springs
the
use
of
all
of
which
is
now
well
understood
at
that
time
when
falcons
were
so
much
required
it
was
necessary
that
people
should
be
employed
to
catch
them
when
young
and
the
author
of
this
book
speaks
of
nets
of
various
sorts
and
the
pronged
piece
of
wood
in
the
middle
of
which
a
or
some
other
bird
was
placed
in
order
to
attract
the
falcons

fourteenth
century
two
methods
were
in
use
in
those
days
for
catching
the
woodcook
and
pheasant
which
deserve
to
be
mentioned
the
pheasants
says
king
modus
are
of
such
a
nature
that
the
male
bird
can
not
bear
the
company
of
another
taking
advantage
of
this
weakness
the
plan
of
placing
a
mirror
which
balanced
a
sort
of
wicker
cage
or
coop
was
adopted
the
pheasant
thinking
he
saw
his
fellow
attacked
him
struck
against
the
glass
and
brought
down
the
coop
in
which
he
had
leisure
to
reflect
on
his
jealousy
fig
woodcocks
which
are
says
the
author
the
most
silly
birds
were
caught
in
this
way
the
was
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
clothes
of
the
colour
of
dead
leaves
only
having
two
little
holes
for
his
eyes
when
he
saw
one
he
knelt
down
noiselessly
and
supported
his
arms
on
two
sticks
so
as
to
keep
perfectly
still
when
the
bird
was
not
looking
towards
him
he
cautiously
approached
it
on
his
knees
holding
in
his
hands
two
little
dry
sticks
covered
with
red
cloth
which
he
gently
waved
so
as
to
divert
the
bird
attention
from
himself
in
this
way
he
gradually
got
near
enough
to
pass
a
noose
which
he
kept
ready
at
the
end
of
a
stick
round
the
bird
neck
fig
however
ingenious
these
tricks
may
appear
they
are
eclipsed
by
one
we
find
recorded
in
the
ixeuticon
a
very
elegant
latin
poem
by
angelis
de
barga
written
two
centuries
later
in
order
to
catch
a
large
number
of
starlings
this
author
assures
us
it
is
only
necessary
to
have
two
or
three
in
a
cage
and
when
a
flight
of
these
birds
is
seen
passing
to
liberate
them
with
a
very
long
twine
attached
to
their
claws
the
twine
must
be
covered
with
and
as
the
released
birds
instantly
join
their
friends
all
those
they
come
near
get
glued
to
the
twine
and
fall
together
to
the
ground

fourteenth
century
as
at
the
present
time
the
object
of
was
twofold
namely
to
procure
game
for
food
and
to
capture
birds
to
be
kept
either
for
their
voice
or
for
fancy
as
pets
the
trade
in
the
latter
was
so
important
at
least
in
paris
that
the
formed
a
numerous
corporation
having
its
statutes
and
privileges
the
pont
au
change
then
covered
on
each
side
with
houses
and
shops
occupied
by
goldsmiths
and
was
the
place
where
these
people
carried
on
their
trade
and
they
had
the
privilege
of
hanging
their
cages
against
the
houses
even
without
the
sanction
of
the
proprietors
this
curious
right
was
granted
to
them
by
charles
vi
in
in
return
for
which
they
were
bound
to
provide
four
hundred
birds
whenever
a
king
was
crowned
and
an
equal
number
when
the
queen
made
her
first
entry
into
her
good
town
of
paris
the
goldsmiths
and
however
finding
that
this
became
a
nuisance
and
that
it
injured
their
trade
tried
to
get
it
abolished
they
applied
to
the
authorities
to
protect
their
rights
urging
that
the
approaches
to
their
shops
the
rents
of
which
they
paid
regularly
were
continually
obstructed
by
a
crowd
of
purchasers
and
dealers
in
birds
the
case
was
brought
several
times
before
parliament
which
only
confirmed
the
orders
of
the
kings
of
france
and
the
ancient
privileges
of
the
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
quarrel
became
so
bitter
that
the
goldsmiths
and
changers
took
to
throwing
down
the
cages
and
birds
and
trampling
them
under
foot
and
even
assaulted
and
openly
the
poor
but
a
degree
of
parliament
again
justified
the
sale
of
birds
on
the
pont

change
by
condemning

it
is
satisfactory
to
observe
that
at
that
period
measures
were
taken
to
preserve
nests
and
to
prevent
from
the
of
march
to
the
of
august
besides
this
it
was
necessary
to
have
an
express
permission
from
the
king
himself
to
give
persons
the
right
of
catching
birds
on
the
king
domains
before
any
one
could
sell
birds
it
was
required
for
him
to
have
been
received
as
a
master
the
recognised
therefore
had
no
opponents
except
dealers
from
other
countries
who
brought
parrots
and
other
foreign
specimens
into
paris
these
dealers
were
however
obliged
to
conform
to
strict
rules
they
were
required
on
their
arrival
to
exhibit
their
birds
from
ten
to
twelve
on
the
marble
stone
in
the
palace
yard
on
the
days
when
parliament
sat
in
order
that
the
masters
and
governors
of
the
king
aviary
and
after
them
the
presidents
and
councillors
might
have
the
first
choice
before
other
people
of
anything
they
wished
to
buy
they
were
besides
bound
to
part
the
male
and
female
birds
in
separate
cages
with
tickets
on
them
so
that
purchasers
might
not
be
deceived
and
in
case
of
dispute
on
this
point
some
sworn
inspectors
were
appointed
as
arbitrators
no
doubt
emboldened
by
the
victory
which
they
had
achieved
over
the
goldsmiths
of
the
pont
an
change
the
of
paris
attempted
to
forbid
any
bourgeois
of
the
town
from
breeding
canaries
or
any
sort
of
cage
birds
the
bourgeois
resented
this
and
brought
their
case
before
the
marshals
of
france
they
urged
that
it
was
easy
for
them
to
breed
canaries
and
it
was
also
a
pleasure
for
their
wives
and
daughters
to
teach
them
whereas
those
bought
on
the
pont
an
change
were
old
and
difficult
to
educate
this
appeal
was
favourably
received
and
an
order
from
the
tribunal
of
the
marshals
of
france
permitted
the
bourgeois
to
breed
canaries
but
it
forbade
the
sale
of
them
which
it
was
considered
would
interfere

which
have
ever
been

by

by

would
form

encyclopaedia
of

we
shall
give
a

sketch
of

kinds
of

which
were
most
in
fashion
during
the
middle
ages
and
to
the
end
of

sixteenth

omitting
however
the
religious
festivals
which
belong
to
a
different
category
the
public
festivals
which
will
come
under
the
chapter
on
ceremonials
the

and

matches
and
other
sports
of

which
belong
to
chivalry
and
lastly
the
scenic
and
literary
representations
which
specially
belong
to
the
history
of
the
stage
we
shall
therefore
limit
ourselves
here
to
giving
in
a
condensed
form
a
few
historical
details
of
certain
court
amusements
and
a
short
description
of
the
games
of
skill
and
of
chance
and
also
of
dancing
the
romans
especially
during
the
times
of
the
emperors
had
a
passionate
love
for
performances
in
the
circus
and
amphitheatre
as
well
as
for
chariot
races
horse
races
foot
races
combats
of
animals
and
feats
of
strength
and
agility
the
daily
life
of
the
roman
people
may
be
summed
up
as
consisting
of
taking
their
food
and
enjoying
games
in
the
circus
et
a
taste
for
similar
amusements
was
common
to
the
gauls
as
well
as
to
the
whole
roman
empire
and
were
historians
silent
on
the
subject
we
need
no
further
information
than
that
which
is
to
be
gathered
from
the
ruins
of
the
numerous
amphitheatres
which
are
to
be
found
at
every
centre
of
roman
occupation
the
circus
disappeared
on
the
establishment
of
the
christian
religion
for
the
bishops
condemned
it
as
a
profane
and
sanguinary
vestige
of
paganism
and
no
doubt
this
led
to
the
cessation
of
combats
between
man
and
beast
they
continued
however
to
pit
wild
or
savage
animals
against
one
another
and
to
train
dogs
to
fight
with
lions
tigers
bears
and
bulls
otherwise
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
the
restoration
by
king
chilpéric
of
the
circuses
and
arenas
at
paris
and
soissons
the
remains
of
one
of
these
circuses
was
not
long
ago
discovered
in
paris
whilst
they
were
engaged
in
laying
the
foundations
for
a
new
street
on
the
west
side
of
the
hill
of
geneviève
a
short
distance
from
the
old
palace
of
the
caesars
known
by
the
name
of
the
thermes
of
julian
gregory
of
tours
states
that
chilpéric
revived
the
ancient
games
of
the
circus
but
that
gaul
had
ceased
to
be
famous
for
good
athletes
and
although
animal
combats
continued
to
take
place
for
the
amusement
of
the
kings
one
day
king
pepin
halted
with
the
principal
officers
of
his
army
at
the
abbey
of
ferrières
and
witnessed
a
fight
between
a
lion
and
a
bull
the
bull
was
of
enormous
size
and
extraordinary
strength
but
nevertheless
the
lion
overcame
him
whereupon
pepin
who
was
surnamed
the
short
turned
to
his
officers
who
used
to
joke
him
about
his
short
stature
and
said
to
them
make
the
lion
loose
his
hold
of
the
bull
or
kill
him
no
one
dared
to
undertake
so
perilous
a
task
and
some
said
aloud
that
the
man
who
would
measure
his
strength
with
a
lion
must
be
mad
upon
this
pepin
sprang
into
the
arena
sword
in
hand
and
with
two
blows
cut
off
the
heads
of
the
lion
and
the
bull
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
said
to
his
astonished
officers
am
i
not
fit
to
be
your
master
size
can
not
compare
with
courage
remember
what
little
david
did
to
the
giant
goliath
eight
hundred
years
later
there
were
occasional
animal
combats
at
the
court
of
francis
i
a
fine
lady
says
brantôme
went
to
see
the
lions
in
company
with
a
gentleman
who
much
admired
her
she
suddenly
let
her
glove
drop
and
it
fell
into
the
lions
den
beg
of
you
she
said
in
the
calmest
way
to
her
admirer
go
amongst
the
lions
and
bring
me
back
my
glove
the
gentleman
made
no
remark
but
without
even
drawing
his
sword
went
into
the
den
and
gave
himself
up
silently
to
death
to
please
the
lady
the
lions
did
not
move
and
he
was
able
to
leave
their
den
without
a
scratch
and
return
the
lady
her
missing
glove
is
your
glove
madam
he
coldly
said
to
her
who
evidently
valued
his
life
at
so
small
a
price
if
you
can
find
any
one
else
who
would
do
the
same
as
i
have
done
for
you
so
saying
he
left
her
and
never
afterwards
looked
at
or
even
spoke
to
her
it
has
been
imagined
that
the
kings
of
france
only
kept
lions
as
living
symbols
of
royalty
in
philippe
de
valois
bought
a
barn
in
the
rue
froidmantel
near
the
château
du
louvre
where
he
established
a
menagerie
for
his
lions
bears
leopards
and
other
wild
beasts
this
royal
menagerie
still
existed
in
the
reigns
of
charles
viii
and
francis
charles
and
his
successors
had
an
establishment
of
lions
in
the
quadrangle
of
the
grand
hôtel
de
paul
on
the
very
spot
which
was
subsequently
the
site
of
the
rue
des
lions
paul
these
wild
beasts
were
sometimes
employed
in
the
combats
and
were
pitted
against
bulls
and
dogs
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
his
court
it
was
after
one
of
these
combats
that
charles
excited
by
the
sanguinary
spectacle
wished
to
enter
the
arena
alone
in
order
to
attack
a
lion
which
had
torn
some
of
his
best
dogs
to
pieces
and
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
the
audacious
sovereign
was
dissuaded
from
his
foolish
purpose
henry
iii
had
no
disposition
to
imitate
his
brother
example
for
dreaming
one
night
that
his
lions
were
devouring
him
he
had
them
all
killed
the
next
day
the
love
for
hunting
wild
animals
such
as
the
wolf
bear
and
boar
see
chapter
on
hunting
from
an
early
date
took
the
place
of
the
animal
combats
as
far
as
the
court
and
the
nobles
were
concerned
the
people
were
therefore
deprived
of
the
spectacle
of
the
combats
which
had
had
so
much
charm
for
them
and
as
they
could
not
resort
to
the
alternative
of
the
chase
they
treated
themselves
to
a
feeble
imitation
of
the
games
of
the
circus
in
such
amusements
as
setting
dogs
to
worry
old
horses
or
donkeys
fig
nevertheless
continued
in
the
southern
provinces
of
france
as
also
in
spain
at
village
feasts
not
only
did
wrestling
matches
take
place
but
also
queer
kinds
of
combats
with
sticks
or
birch
boughs
two
men
blindfolded
each
armed
with
a
stick
and
holding
in
his
hand
a
rope
fastened
to
a
stake
entered
the
arena
and
went
round
and
round
trying
to
strike
at
a
fat
goose
or
a
pig
which
was
also
let
loose
with
them
it
can
easily
be
imagined
that
the
greater
number
of
the
blows
fell
like
hail
on
one
or
other
of
the
principal
actors

advanced
alone
on
horseback

armies
about
to
commence
the
engagement

drew
off
the
attention
of
the
english
by
singing

song
of
roland
he
then
began
juggling
and
taking
his
lance
by
the
hilt
he
threw
it
into
the
air
and
caught
it
by
the
point
as
it
fell
then
drawing
his
sword
he
spun
it
several
times
over
his
head
and
caught
it
in
a
similar
way
as
it
fell
after
these
skilful
exercises
during
which
the
enemy
were
gaping
in
mute
astonishment
he
forced
his
charger
through
the
english
ranks
and
caused
great
havoc
before
he
fell
positively
riddled
with
wounds
notwithstanding
this
noble
instance
not
to
belie
the
old
proverb
jugglers
were
never
received
into
the
order
of
knighthood

were
after
a
time
as
much
abused

they
had

votaries

the
lower
orders
laughed
at
their
coarseness
and
were
amused
at
their
juggleries
but
the
nobility
were
disgusted
with
them
and
they
were
absolutely
excluded
from
the
presence
of
ladies
and
girls
in
the
châteaux
and
houses
of
the
bourgeoisie
we
see
in

tale
of
le

they
acquired
ill
fame
everywhere
inasmuch

they
were
addicted

in

disrepute

chronicler
of
charles
jean
tells
us
of
a
not
less
remarkable
feat
performed
on
the
occasion
of
the
obsequies
of
duke
pierre
de
bourbon
which
were
celebrated
at
moulins
in
the
month
of
october
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
the
court
amongst
other
performances
was
that
of
a
german
dancer
named
georges
menustre
a
very
young
man
who
had
a
thick
rope
stretched
across
from
the
highest
part
of
the
tower
of
the
castle
of
mâcon
to
the
windows
of
the
steeple
of
the
church
of
the
jacobites
the
height
of
this
from
the
ground
was
fathoms
and
the
distance
from
the
castle
to
the
steeple
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
paces
on
two
evenings
in
succession
he
walked
along
this
rope
and
on
the
second
occasion
when
he
started
from
the
tower
of
the
castle
his
feat
was
witnessed
by
the
king
and
upwards
of
thirty
thousand
persons
he
performed
all
sorts
of
graceful
tricks
such
as
dancing
grotesque
dances
to
music
and
hanging
to
the
rope
by
his
feet
and
by
his
teeth
although
so
strange
and
marvellous
these
feats
were
nevertheless
actually
performed
unless
human
sight
had
been
deceived
by
magic
a
female
dancer
also
performed
in
a
novel
way
cutting
capers
throwing
somersaults
and
performing
graceful
moorish
and
other
remarkable
and
peculiar
dances
such
was
their
manner
of
celebrating
a
funeral
in
the
sixteenth
century
these
dancers
and
tumblers
became
so
numerous
that
they
were
to
be
met
with
everywhere
in
the
provinces
as
well
as
in
the
towns
many
of
them
were
bohemians
or
zingari
they
travelled
in
companies
sometimes
on
foot
sometimes
on
horseback
and
sometimes
with
some
sort
of
a
conveyance
containing
the
accessories
of
their
craft
and
a
travelling
theatre
but
people
began
to
tire
of
these
sorts
of
entertainments
the
more
so
as
they
were
required
to
pay
for
them
and
they
naturally
preferred
the
public
rejoicings
which
cost
them
nothing
they
were
particularly
fond
of
illuminations
and
fireworks
which
are
of
much
later
origin
than
the
invention
of
gunpowder
although
the
saracens
at
the
time
of
the
crusades
used
a
greek
fire
for
illuminations
which
considerably
alarmed
the
crusaders
when
they
first
witnessed
its
effects
regular
fireworks
appear
to
have
been
invented
in
italy
where
the
pyrotechnic
art
has
retained
its
superiority
to
this
day
and
where
the
inhabitants
are
as
enthusiastic
as
ever
for
this
sort
of
amusement
and
consider
it
in
fact
inseparable
from
every
religious
private
or
public
festival
this
italian
invention
was
first
introduced
into
the
low
countries
by
the
spaniards
where
it
found
many
admirers
and
it
made
its
appearance
in
france
with
the
italian
artists
who
established
themselves
in
that
country
in
the
reigns
of
charles
louis
and
francis
fireworks
could
not
fail
to
be
attractive
at
the
court
of
the
valois
to
which
catherine
de
médicis
had
introduced
the
manners
and
customs
of
italy
the
french
who
up
to
that
time
had
only
been
accustomed
to
the
illuminations
of
john
day
and
of
the
first
sunday
in
lent
received
those
fireworks
with
great
enthusiasm
and
they
soon
became
a
regular
part
of
the
programme

those
in
which

took

these
were

the
games
of
strength
and

as
well
as
dancing
with
a
notice
of
which
we
shall
conclude
this
chapter
there
were
besides
the
various
games
of
chance
and
the
games
of
fun
and
humour
most
of
the
bourgeois
and
the
villagers
played
a
variety
of
games
of
agility
many
of
which
have
descended
to
our
times
and
are
still
to
be
found
at
our

and
colleges

of

and
all
exercises
which
strengthened

the
suppleness
of
the
limbs
were
long
in
use
among
the
youth
of
the
nobility
figs
and
the
lord
of
fleuranges
in
his
memoirs
written
at
the
court
of
francis
recounts
numerous
exercises
to
which
he
devoted
himself
during
his
childhood
and
youth
and
which
were
then
looked
upon
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
education
of
chivalry
the
nobles
in
this
way
acquired
a
taste
for
physical
exercises
and
took
naturally
to
combats
tournaments
and
hunting
and
subsequently
their
services
in
the
gave
them
plenty
of
opportunities
to
gratify
the
taste
thus
developed
in
them
these
were
not
however
sufficient
for
their
insatiable
activity
when
they
could
not
do
anything
else
they
played
at
tennis
and
such
games
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
these
pastimes
had
so
much
attraction
for
nobles
of
all
ages
that
they
not
unfrequently
sacrificed
their
health
in
consequence
of
overtaxing
their
strength
in

proportions
and
so
well
adapted

they

people
and
who
in
a
celebrated
edict
forbidding

encouraged
the
establishment
of

of
archers

were
the
most
popular
although
they
were
forbidden
both
by
ecclesiastical
and

authority
new
laws
were
continually

nevertheless

were

continued

that

to
us
the
technical
terms
used
in
these
games

varied

the
invention
of
the
game
of
chess
has
been
attributed
to
the
assyrians
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
it
came
from
the
east
and
reached
gaul
about
the
beginning
of
the
ninth
century
although
it
was
not
extensively
known
till
about
the
twelfth
the
annals
of

continually
speak
of
the
barons
playing
at
these
games
and
especially
at
chess
historians
also
mention
chess
and
show
that
it
was
played
with
the
same
zest
in
the
camp
of
the
saracens
as
in
that
of
the
crusaders
we
must
not
be
surprised
if
chess
shared
the
prohibition
laid
upon

for
those
who
were
ignorant
of
its
ingenious
combinations
ranked
it
amongst
games
of
chance
the
council
of
paris
in
therefore
condemned
chess
for
the
same
reasons
as
dice
and
it
was
specially
forbidden
to
church
people
who
had
begun
to
make
it
their
habitual
pastime
the
royal
edict
of
was
equally
unjust
with
regard
to
this
game
we
strictly
forbid
says
louis
any
person
to
play
at
dice

chess
this
pious
king
set
himself
against
these
games
which
he
looked
upon
as
inventions
of
the
devil
after
the
fatal
day
of
mansorah
in
the
king
who
was
still
in
egypt
with
the
remnants
of
his
army
asked
what
his
brother

was
doing
he
was
told
says
joinville
that
he
was
playing
at
tables
with
his
royal
highness
gaultier
de

the
king
was
highly
incensed
against
his
brother
and
though
most
feeble
from
the
effects
of
his
illness
went
to
him
and
taking
the

had
them
thrown

bones

spillikins
games
which
required
pieces

men
in

way
as

which
required
more
quickness
of
hand
than
of
intelligence
and
or
which
was
played
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
and
was
the
great
amusement
of

small
pages
in

houses
of
the
nobility
when
they
had
not
épingles
honchets
or
draughtsmen
to
play
with
they
used
their
fingers
instead
and
played
a
game
which
is
still
most
popular
amongst
the
italian
people
called
the
and
which
was
as
much
in
vogue
with
the
ancient
romans
as
it
is
among
the
modern
italians
it
consisted
of
suddenly
raising
as
many
fingers
as
had
been
shown
by
one
adversary
and
gave
rise
to
a
great
amount
of
amusement
among
the
players
and
the
games
played
by
girls
were
of

than

we
must
name
dancing
which
was
certainly
one
of
the
principal
amusements
of
society
and
which
has
come
down
to
us
through
all
religions
all
customs
all
people
and
all
ages
preserving
at
the
same
time
much
of
its
original
character
dancing
appears
at
each
period
of
the
world
history
to
have
been
alternately
religions
and
profane
lively
and
solemn
frivolous
and
severe
though
dancing
was
as
common
an
amusement
formerly
as
it
is
now
there
was
this
essential
difference
between
the
two
periods
namely
that
certain
people
such
as
the
romans
were
very
fond
of
seeing
dancing
but
did
not
join
in
it
themselves
tiberius
drove
the
dancers
out
of
rome
and
domitian
dismissed
certain
senators
from
their
seats
in
the
senate
who
had
degraded
themselves
by
dancing
and
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
romans
from
the
conquest
of
julius
caesar
did
not
themselves
patronise
the
art
there
were
a
number
of
professional
dancers
in
gaul
as
well
as
in
the
other
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
who
were
hired
to
dance
at
feasts
and
who
endeavoured
to
do
their
best
to
make
their
art
as
popular
as
possible
the
lightheartedness
of
the
gauls
their
natural
gaiety
their
love
for
violent
exercise
and
for
pleasures
of
all
sorts
made
them
delight
in
dancing
and
indulge
in
it
with
great
energy
and
thus
notwithstanding
the
repugnance
of
the
roman
aristocracy
and
the
prohibitions
and
anathemas
of
councils
and
synods
dancing
has
always
been
one
of
the
favourite
pastimes
of

gauls

legend
of
the
fifteenth
century
of
a
woodcut
by
wohlgemuth
in
the
liber
chronicorum
mundi
folio
nuremberg
leuce
carin
a
writer
of
doubtful
authority
states
that
in
the
early
history
of
christianity
the
faithful
danced
or
rather
stamped
in
measured
time
during
religions
ceremonials
gesticulating
and
distorting
themselves
this
is
however
a
mistake
the
only
thing
approaching
to
it
was
the
slight
trace
of
the
ancient
pagan
dances
which
remained
in
the
feast
of
the
first
sunday
in
lent
and
which
probably
belonged
to
the
religious
ceremonies
of
the
druids
at
nightfall
fires
were
lighted
in
public
places
and
numbers
of
people
danced
madly
round
them
rioting
and
disorderly
conduct
often
resulted
from
this
popular
feast
and
the
magistrates
were
obliged
to
interfere
in
order
to
suppress
it
the
church
too
did
not
close
her
eyes
to
the
abuses
which
this
feast
engendered
although
episcopal
admonitions
were
not
always
listened
to
fig
we
see
in
the
records
of
one
of
the
most
recent
councils
of
narbonne
that
the
custom
of
dancing
in
the
churches
and
in
the
cemeteries
on
certain
feasts
had
not
been
abolished
in
some
parts
of
the
languedoc
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
dancing
was
at
all
times
forbidden
by
the
catholic
church
on
account
of
its
tendency
to
corrupt
the
morals
and
for
centuries
ecclesiastical
authority
was
strenuously
opposed
to
it
but
on
the
other
hand
it
could
not
complain
of
want
of
encouragement
from
the
civil
power
when
king
childebert
in
forbade
all
dances
in
his
domains
he
was
only
induced
to
do
so
by
the
influence
of
the
bishops
we
have
but
little
information
respecting
the
dances
of
this
period
and
it
would
be
impossible
accurately
to
determine
as
to
the
justice
of
their
being
forbidden
they
were
certainly
no
longer
those
which
the
franks
had
brought
with
them
and
which
antiquarians
have
mentioned
under
the
name
of
dances
in
any
case
reappeared
at
the
commencement
of
chivalry
for
when
a
new
knight
was
elected
all
the
knights
in
full
armour
performed
evolutions
either
on
foot
or
on
horseback
to
the
sound
of
military
music
and
the
populace
danced
round
them
it
has
been
said
that
this
was
the
origin
of
court
ballets
and
la
colombière
in
his
théâtre
et
de
chevalerie
relates
that
this
ancient
dance
of
the
knights
was
kept
up
by
the
spaniards
who
called
it
the
the
middle
ages
was
the
great
epoch
for
dancing
especially
in
france
there
were
an
endless
number
of
dancing
festivals
and
from
reading
the
old
poets
and
romancers
one
might
imagine
that
the
french
had
never
anything
better
to
do
than
to
dance
and
that
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
a
curious
argument
in
favour
of
the
practical
utility
of
dancing
is
suggested
by
jean
tabourot
in
his
orchésographie
published
at
langres
in
under
the
name
of
thoinot
arbeau
he
says
dancing
is
practised
in
order
to
see
whether
lovers
are
healthy
and
suitable
for
one
another
at
the
end
of
a
dance
the
gentlemen
are
permitted
to
kiss
their
mistresses
in
order
that
they
may
ascertain
if
they
have
an
agreeable
breath
in
this
matter
besides
many
other
good
results
which
follow
from
dancing
it
becomes
necessary
for
the
good
governing
of
society
such
was
the
doctrine
of
the
courts
of
love
which
stoutly
took
up
the
defence
of
dancing
against
the
clergy
in
those
days
as
soon
as
the
two
sexes
were
assembled
in
sufficient
numbers
before
or
after
the
feasts
the
balls
began
and
men
and
women
took
each
other
by
the
hand
and
commenced
the
performance
in
regular
steps

they
were
so
familiar
that
they
thought

of

needless

often
speak
of

romances
of
chivalry
frequently
mention
that
knights
used
to
dance
with
the
dames
and
young
ladies
without
taking
off
their
helmets
and
coats
of
mail
although
this
costume
was
hardly
fitted
for
the
purpose
we
find
in
the
romance
of
perceforet
that
after
a
repast
whilst
the
tables
were
being
removed
everything
was
prepared
for
a
ball
and
that
although
the
knights
made
no
change
in
their
accoutrements
yet
the
ladies
went
and
made
fresh
toilettes
then
says
the
old
novelist
the
young
knights
and
the
young
ladies
began
to
play
their
instruments
and
to
have
the
dance
from
this
custom
may
be
traced
the
origin
of
the
ancient
gallic
proverb

panse
vient
la
after
the
feast
comes
the
dance
sometimes
a
minstrel
sang
songs
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
harp
and
the
young
ladies
danced
in
couples

repeated
at
intervals
the
minstrel
songs

performed

performer
bore
in

a

neighbours
from
blowing
it
out
which
each
one
tried
to
do
if
possible

dance
which
was
in
use

to

had
themselves

determined

had
the
good
fortune
to
escape

their
former
prosperity
and
the
friendly
relations
which
were
established
between
the
kings
of
the
franks
and
the
eastern
empire
encouraged
the
gallic
cities
in
cultivating
a
commerce
which
was
at
that
time
the
most
important
and
most
extensive
in
the
world

successor
to
carthage

undoubtedly
at

of
the
commercial
cities
of
france
next
to
her
came
arles
which
supplied
and
seamen
to
the
fleet
of
provence
and
narbonne
which
admitted
into
its
harbour
ships
from
spain
sicily
and
africa
until
in

of
the
aude

it
was

to

carried
off

bold
as
to
attempt
to
continue
their
business
it
was
the
church
occupied
as
she
was
with
the
interests
of
civilisation
who
again
assisted
commerce

annihilation

in
arresting

this
was
all
that
could
be
done
at
that
period
and
the
church
accomplished
it
by
taking
the
high
hand
and
with
as
much
unselfishness
as
energy
and
courage
she
regulated
society
which
had

to
have

to

spirit

liberty
whence
were

spring

the

the

trading
activity

itself

were
gladly

from
this
moment
proportions
hitherto
unknown
notwithstanding
the
papal
bulls

forbade

with
infidels
the
voice
of
interest
was
more
listened
to
than

of

did
not
fear
to
disobey
the
political
and
religions
orders
which
forbade
them
to
carry
arms

to
the
enemies
of

it
was
easy
to
foretell
from
the
very
first
that
the
military

would
not

permanent
in

therefore
the
nearer
the

to
be
the
greater

the
efforts

as

almost
always
gave

was
not

in
multiplying
as
much
as
possible

merchants
naturally
came
to
exhibit
their
goods

afforded
the
greatest
promise
of

readily
disposing
of

early

temporary
and
periodical
markets
of
this
kind
existed
but
except
at
denis
articles
of
local
consumption
only
were
brought
to
them
the
reasons
for
this
were
the
heavy
taxes
which
were
levied
by
the
feudal
lords
on
all
merchandise
exhibited
for
sale
and
the
danger
which
foreign
merchants
ran
of
being
plundered
on
their
way
or
even
at
the
fair
itself
these
causes
for

useful

beneficial

no

preceded

emperor
reign

fair
of
landit
was
renowned
over
the
whole
of
europe
and
attracted
merchants
from
all
countries
it
was
held
in
the
month
of
june
and
only
lasted
fifteen
days
goods
of
all
sorts
both
of
home
and
foreign
manufacture
were
sold
but
the
sale
of
parchment
was
the
principal
object
of
the
fair

purchase
a

of

that
the

produced
by
the

was
favourable
to
the

as

many
laws
and
regulations
prove
that
the
kings
were
alive
to
the
importance
of

of
this

death
to
guarantee
the
security
of
vendors
and
at
the

time
to
ensure
purchasers
against
fraud
all
these
bear
undoubted
witness
that
an
enlightened
policy
in
favour
of
commerce
had
already
sprung
up
philippe
le

issued
several
prohibitory
enactments
also
in
the
interest
of

commerce
and
local
industry
which
louis
confirmed
philippe
le
long
attempted
even
to
outdo
the
judicious
efforts
of
louis
and
tried
though
unsuccessfully
to
establish
a
uniformity
in
the
weights
and
measures
throughout
the
kingdom
a
reform
however
which
was
never
accomplished
until
the
revolution
of
it
is
difficult
to
credit
how
many
different
weights
and
measures
were
in
use
at
that
time
each
one
varying
according
to
local
custom
or
the
choice
of
the
lord
of
the

who
probably
in
some
way
profited
by
the
confusion
which
this
uncertain
state
of

must
have
produced
the
fraud
and
errors
to
which
this
led
may
easily
be
imagined

by
a
labyrinth
of
incomprehensible
calculations
which
it
is
impossible
to
determine
with
any
degree

the
weights
were
more
uniform
and
less
uncertain
the

was
everywhere
in
use
but
it
was
not
everywhere
of
the
same
standard

at

it
weighed
sixteen
ounces

at

the
rule
at

the

was
only
thirteen
and

at
marseilles
thirteen
ounces
and
at
other
places
it
even
fell
to
twelve

there
was
in

a

called

this

be

successfully
on

the

were

to
mix
in

considering
it
unworthy
of

the
bourgeois
for
want

liberal
feeling

expansiveness
in

ideas
were
satisfied
with
appropriating

local

foreign
commerce
even

succeeded

expelled
the
advantage
of
exclusively
trading
with

securing

had
attracted
the
italians
who
were
frequently
only
jews
in

concealing
themselves
as

their

under
the
generic

of

it

under

various

when
they
frequented
the

of

and
came
to

these

sufficiently
testify
the
condition
of

at

and
prove
that
this

branches

was
arrested
in

by
the
political
troubles

followed

that
the

also
to

the
only
practical
attempt
of

was
to
forbid
the
import
of

and
to
endeavour

oppose
the
progress
of

by
rigid
enactments
certainly
the

little
understood
the

derived

forbade

be

examples
which
may
serve
to
some
extent
as
an
historical
parallel
to
the
analogous
institutions
of
the
present
day
we
may
mention
the
roman
which
were
really
leagues
of
artisans
following
the
same
calling
and
the
scandinavian
guilds
whose
object
was
to
assimilate
the
different
branches
of
industry
and
trade
either
of
a
city
or
of
some
particular
district
indeed
brotherhoods
amongst
the
labouring
classes
always
existed
under
the
german
conquerors
from
the
moment
when
europe
so
long
divided
into
roman
provinces
shook
off
the
yoke
of
subjection
to
rome
although
she
still
adhered
to
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
nation
which
had
held
her
in
subjection
for
so
many
generations
we
can
however
only
regard
the
few
traces
which
remain
of
these
brotherhoods
as
evidence
of
their
having
once
existed
and
not
as
indicative
of
their
having
been

flourishing

at
that
remote
period
we
also
see
charlemagne
in
several
of
his
statutes
taking
steps
in
order
that
the
number
of
persons
engaged
in
providing
food
of
different
kinds
should
everywhere
be
adequate
to
provide
for
the
necessities

would

up
a
remembrance
of

her
heirs
the
collectorship
of
the
dues
which
were
payable
by
tanners
curriers
and
shoemakers
under
philip
augustus
similar
concessions
became
more
frequent
and
it
is
evident
that
at
that
time
trade
was
beginning
to
take
root
and
to
require
special
and
particular
administration
this
led
to
regulations
being
drawn
up
for
each
trade
to
which
philip
augustus
gave
his
sanction
in
he
confirmed
the
statutes
of
the
butchers
and
the
furriers

drapers
also
obtained
favourable
concessions
from
him
according
to
the
learned

thierry
corporations
like
civic
communities
were
engrafted
on
previously
existing
guilds
such
as
on
the
colleges
or
corporations
of
workmen
which
were
of
roman
origin
in
the
which
signifies
a
banquet
at
common
expense
there
was
a
mutual
assurance
against
misfortunes
and
injuries
of
all
sorts
such
as
fire
and
shipwreck
and
also
against
all
lawsuits
incurred
for
offences
and
crimes
even
though
they
were
proved
against
the
accused
each
of
these
associations
was
placed
under
the
patronage
of
a
god
or
of
a
hero
and
had
its
compulsory
statutes
each
had
its
chief
or
president
chosen
from
among
the
members
and
a
common
treasury
supplied
by
annual
contributions
roman
colleges
as
we
have
already
stated
were
established
with
a
more
special
purpose
and
were
more
exclusively
confined
to
the
peculiar
trade
to
which
they
belonged
but
these
equally
with
the
guilds
possessed
a
common
exchequer
enjoyed
equal
rights
and
privileges
elected
their
own
presidents
and
celebrated
in
common
their
sacrifices
festivals
and
banquets
we
have
therefore
good
reason
for
agreeing
in
the
opinion
of
the
celebrated
historian
who
considers
that
in
the
establishment
of
a
corporation
the
guild
should
be
to
a
certain
degree
the
motive

and

should

it
is
certain
however
that
during
several
centuries
corporations
were
either
dissolved
or
hidden
from
public
notice
for
they
almost
entirely
disappeared
from
the
historic
records
during
the
partial
return
to
barbarism
when
the
production
of
objects
of
daily
necessity
and
the
preparation
of
food
were
entrusted
to
slaves
under
the
eye
of
their
master
not
till
the
twelfth
century
did
they
again
begin
to
flourish
and
as
might
be
supposed
it
was
italy
which
gave
the
signal
for
the
resuscitation
of
the
institutions
whose
birthplace
had
been
rome
and
which
barbarism
had
allowed
to
fall
into
decay
brotherhoods
of
artisans
were
also
founded
at
an
early
period
in
the
north
of
gaul
whence
they
rapidly
spread
beyond
the
rhine
under
the
emperor
henry
that
is
during
the
tenth
century
the
ordinary
condition
of
artisans
in
germany
was
still
serfdom
but
two
centuries
later
the
greater
number
of
trades
in
most
of
the
large
towns
of
the
empire
had
congregated
together
in
colleges
or
bodies
under
the
name
of
unions
or
fig
as
for
example
at
gozlar
at
würzburg
at
brunswick
these
colleges
however
were
not
established
without
much
difficulty
and
without
the
energetic
resistance
of
the
ruling
powers
inasmuch
as
they
often
raised
their
pretensions
so
high
as
to
wish
to
substitute
their
authority
for
the
senatorial
law
and
thus
to
grasp
the
government
of
the
cities
the
thirteenth
century
witnessed
obstinate
and
sanguinary
feuds
between
these
two
parties
each
of
which
was
alternately
victorious
whichever
had
the
upper
hand
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
carry
out
the
most
cruel
reprisals
against
its
defeated
opponents
the
emperors
frederick
ii
and
henry
vii
tried
to
put
an
end
to
these
strifes
by
abolishing
the
corporations
of
workmen
but
these
powerful
associations
fearlessly
opposed
the
imperial
authority
in
france
the
organization
of
communities
of
artisans
an
organization
which
in
many
ways
was
connected
with
the
commercial
movement
but
which
must
not
be
confounded
with
it
did
not
give
rise
to
any
political
difficulty
it
seems
not
even
to
have
met
with
any
opposition
from
the
feudal
powers
who
no
doubt
found
it
an
easy
pretext
for
levying
additional
rates
and
taxes
the
most
ancient
of
these
corporations
was
the
parisian
or
corporation
of
the
bourgeois
for
canal
navigation
which
probably
dates
its
origin
back
to
the
college
of
parisian
existing
before
the
roman
conquest
this
mercantile
association
held
its
meetings
in
the

very
spot

bourgeois

the

fig

the
nobility

hence
we
can
understand
how
the
bourgeois
who
during
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
were
a
distinct
section
of
the
community
became
at

the

although

many

had
been
authorised
by
several
of
the

to
make

whereby
they
might

it
was

from
the

that
the
first

these

can
be
dated

in

set
to
work
to
establish

and

in

of

to
this
end
he
ascertained
from
the
verbal
testimony
of
the
senior
members
of
each
corporation
the
customs
and
usages
of
the
various
crafts
which
for
the
most
part
up
to
that
time
had
not
been
committed
to
writing
he
arranged
and
probably
amended
them
in
many
ways
and
thus
composed
the
famous
book
of
trades
which
as
depping
the
able
editor
of
this
valuable
compilation
first
published

has
the
advantage
of
being
to
a

extent
the
genuine
production
of
the
corporations
themselves
and
not

rules
established
and
framed
by
the
municipal
or
judicial
authorities
from
that
time
corporations
gradually
introduced
themselves
into

the
royal

it
must
be
observed
however
that
several
of
the
most
important
trades
such
as
the
butchers
tanners
glaziers
were
omitted
either
because
they
neglected
to
be
registered
at
the
châtelet
where
the
inquiry
superintended
by
boileau
was
made
or
because
some
private
interest
induced
them
to
keep
aloof
from
this
registration
which
probably
imposed
some
sort
of
fine
and
a
tax
upon
them
in
the
following
century
the
number
of
trade
associations
considerably
increased
and
wonderfully

reigns
of
the
last
of
the
valois
and
the
first
of
the

the
historian

henry
sauval
enumerated
no
fewer
than
fifteen
hundred

trade
associations
in
the
capital
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
must
be
remarked
however
that
the
societies
of
artisans
were
much
subdivided
owing
to
the
simple
fact
that
each
craft
could
only
practise
its
own
special
work
thus
in
boileau
book
we
find
four
different
corporations
of
or
makers
of
chaplets
six
of
hatters
six
of
weavers
besides
these
societies
of
artisans
there
were
in

a

occupied
a
more
important
position

their
number
at
first
frequently
varied

finally
it
was
settled
at
six
and
they
were
termed

they
comprised
the
drapers
which
always
took
precedence
of
the
five
others
the
grocers
the
mercers
the
furriers
the
hatters
and
the
goldsmiths
these
five
for
a
long
time
disputed
the
question
of
precedence
and
finally
they
decided
the
matter
by
lot
as
they
were
not
able
to
agree
in
any
other
way

jealous
it
is
clear
however
that
these
six
bodies
were
imbued
with
a
kind
of
aristocratic
spirit
which
made
them
place
trading
much
above
handicraft
in
their
own
class
and
set
a
high
value
on
their
calling
as
merchants
thus
contemporary
historians
tell
us
that
any
merchant
who
compromised
the
dignity
of
the
company
fell
into
the
class
of
the
lower
orders
that
mercers
boasted
of
excluding
from
their
body
the
upholsterers
who
were
but
artisans
that
hatters
who
were
admitted
into
the
to
replace
one
of
the
other
trades
became
in
consequence
merchants
instead
of
artisans
which
they
had
been
up
to
that
time
notwithstanding
the
statutes
so
carefully
compiled
and
revised
by
etienne
boileau
and
his
successors
and
in
spite
of
the
numerous
arbitrary
rules
which
the
sovereigns
the
magistrates
and
the
corporations
themselves
strenuously
endeavoured
to
frame
order
and
unity
were
far
from
governing
the
commerce
and
industry
of
paris
during
the
middle
ages
and
what
took
place
in
paris
generally
repeated
itself
elsewhere
serious
disputes
continually
arose
between
the
authorities
and
those
amenable
to
their
jurisdiction
and
between
the
various
crafts
themselves
notwithstanding
the
relation
which
they
bore
to
each
other
from
the
similarity
of
their
employments
in
fact
in
this
as
in
many
other
matters
social
disorder
often
emanated
from
the
powers
whose
duty
it
was
in
the
first
instance
to
have
repressed
it
thus
at
the
time
when
philip
augustus
extended
the
boundaries
of
his
capital
so
as
to
include
the
boroughs
in
it
which
until
then
had
been
separated
from
the
city
the
lay
and
clerical
lords
under
whose
feudal
dominion
those
districts
had
hitherto
been
placed
naturally
insisted
upon
preserving
all
their
rights
so
forcibly
did
they
do
this
that
the
king
was
obliged
to
recognise
their
claims
and
in
several
boroughs
including
the
bourg
the
beau
bourg
the
bourg
germain
and
the
bourg
auxerrois
there
were
trade
associations
completely
distinct
from
and
independent
of
those
of
ancient
paris
if
we
simply
limit
our
examination
to
that
of
the
condition
of
the
trade
associations
which
held
their
authority
immediately
from
royalty
we
still
see
that
the
causes
of
confusion
were
by
no
means
trifling
for
the
majority
of
the
high
officers
of
the
crown
acting
as
delegates
of
the
royal
authority
were
always
disputing
amongst
themselves
the
right
of
superintending
protecting
judging
punishing
and
above
all
of
exacting
tribute
from
the
members
of
the
various
trades
the
king
granted
to
various
officers
the
privilege
of
arbitrarily
disposing
of
the
freedom
of
each
trade
for
their
own
profit
and
thereby
gave
them
power
over
all
the
merchants
and
craftsmen
who
were
officially
connected
with
them
not
only
in
paris
but
also
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
thus
the
lord
chamberlain
had
jurisdiction
over
the
drapers
mercers
furriers
shoemakers
tailors
and
other
dealers

articles
of
wearing
apparel

these

granted
freedoms
to
artisans
or
in
other
words
they
gave
them
the
right
to
exercise
such
and
such
a
craft
with
assistants
or
companions
exacting
for
the
performance
of
this
trifling
act
a
very
considerable
tax
and
as
they
preferred
receiving
their
revenues
without
the
annoyance
of
having
direct
communication
with
their
humble
subjects
they
appointed

who
were
authorised
to
collect
them
in
their
names
the
most
celebrated
of
these
deputies
were
the
des
who
lived
on
the
fat
of
the
land
in
complete
idleness
and
who
were
surrounded
by
a
mercantile
court
which
appeared
in
all
its
splendour
at
the
trade
festivals

adjudicated

in

or
infractions
in
the
rules
of
the
trade
and
levied
fines
accordingly
we
must
remember
that
the
collectors
of
court
dues
had
always
to
contend
for
the
free
exercise
of
their
jurisdiction
against
the
provost
of
paris
who
considered
their
acquisitions
of
authority
as
interfering
with
his
personal
prerogatives
and
who
therefore
persistently
opposed
them
on
all
occasions
for
instance
if
the
head
baker
ordered
an
artisan
of
the
same
trade
to
be
imprisoned
in
the
châtelet
the
high
provost
who
was
governor
of
the
prison
released
him
immediately
and
in
retaliation
if
the
high
provost
punished
a
baker
the
chief
baker
warmly
espoused
his
subordinate
cause
at
other
times
the
artisans
if
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
deputy
appointed
by
the
great
officer
of
the
crown
whose
dependents
they
were
would
refuse
to
recognise
his
authority
in
this
way
constant
quarrels
and
interminable
lawsuits
occurred
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
disorder
which
must
have
arisen
from
such
a
state
of
things
by
degrees
however
and
in
consequence
of
the
new
tendencies
of
royalty
which
were
simply
directed
to
the
diminution
of
feudal
power
the
numerous
jurisdictions
relating
to
the
various
trades
gradually
returned
to
the
hand
of
the
municipal
provostship
and
this
concentration
of
power
had
the
best
results
as
well
for
the
public
good
as
for
that
of
the
corporations
themselves
having
examined
into
corporations
collectively
and
also
into
their
general
administration
we
will
now
turn
to
consider
their
internal
organization
it
was
only
after
long
and
difficult
struggles
that
these
trade
associations
succeeded
in
taking
a
definite
and
established
position
without
however
succeeding
at
any
time
in
organizing
themselves
as
one
body
on
the
same
basis
and
with
the
same
privileges
therefore
in
pointing
out
the
influential
character
of
these
institutions
generally
we
must
omit
various
matters
specially
connected
with
individual
associations
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
mention
in
this
brief
sketch
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
period
when
the
communities
of
crafts
were
at
the
height
of
their
development
and
power
no
association
of
artisans
could
legally
exist
without
a
license
either
from
the
king
the
lord
the
prince
the
abbot
the
bailiff
or
the
mayor
of
the
district
in
which
it
proposed
to
establish
itself

they
might
modify
their
statutes
provided
that
such
changes
were
confirmed
by
the
king
or
by
the
authorities
it
was
also
necessary
that
these
meetings
at
which
the
royal
delegates
were
present
should
be
duly
authorised

so

to

some
commoner
trades
such
as

were
allowed
an

the
custom
of

had
become
a
sort

of
limiting
the
number
of
masters

workmen

a
pretext
for
intemperance

debauchery

at
times
their
tumultuous

occasioned
much
disorder
in
the
cities
the
facilities
which
these
numerous

possessed

that
towards

century
the

had
no

we
then
find
a
number
of
new
taxes
levied
for
the
benefit
of
the
nobles
the
very
names
of
which
have
fallen
into
disuse

were

to
look

was

unfortunately

that
the

towards

joined

the

mission
of
freeing
the

of

christ
from
the
hands
of
the
infidels
large
sums
of

were
required
to
defray
the
costs
new
taxes
were
accordingly
imposed
but
as
these
did
not
produce
enough
at
once
large
sums
were
raised
by
the
sale
of
some
of
the
feudal
rights
certain
franchises
were
in
this
way
sold
by
the

to

had
been
formerly

were

declining

were
reduced
to
the
lowest
expedients
with
a
view
to
raising
money
and
even
sold
their
estates
at
a
low
price
or
mortgaged
them
to
the
very
jews
whom
they
taxed
so
heavily
every
town
in
which
the
spirit
of
municipality
was
preserved
took
advantage
of
these
circumstances
to
extend
its
liberties
each
monarch
too
found
this
a
favourable
opportunity
to
add
new
fiefs
to
the
crown
and
to
recall
as
many
great
vassals
as
possible
under
his
dominion
it
was
at
this
period

arose
and

which
were

between

date
their

king
and
the
feudal
lords
and
in
addition
to
the
general
subsidies
such
as

on

definite
basis
by
his
orders
a

throughout
the

was
commenced
but

calamities
caused
this
useful
measure
to

consequence
of
a
disaster
which

befallen

did
what
none
of
his
predecessors
had
dared
to
attempt
he
exacted
from
all
his
subjects
a
sol
per
pound
on
their
income
this
tax
which
amounted
to
a
twentieth
part
of
income
was
paid
even
by
the
church
which
for
example
sake
did
not
take
advantage
of
its
immunities
forty
years
later
at
a
council
or
called
by
philip
augustus
a
new
crusade
was
decided
upon
and
under
the
name
of
saladin
tithe
an
annual
tax
was
imposed
on
all
property
whether
landed
or
personal
of
all
who
did
not
take
up
the
cross
to
go
to
the
holy
land
the
nobility
however
so
violently
resisted
this
that
the
king
was
obliged
to
substitute
for
it
a
general
tax
which
although
it
was
still
more
productive
was
less
offensive
in
its
mode
of
collection
on
returning
to
france
in
philip
augustus
rated
and
taxed
every
one
nobility
bourgeois
and
clergy
in
order
to
prosecute
the
great
wars
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
to
provide
for
the
first
paid
troops
ever
known
in
france
he
began
by
confirming
the
enormous
confiscations
of
the
properties
of
the
jews
who
had
been
banished
from
the
kingdom
and
afterwards
sold
a
temporary
permission
to
some
of
the
richest
of
them
to
return
the
jews
at
that
time
were
the
only
possessors
of
available
funds
as
they
were
the
only
people
who
trafficked
and
who
lent
money
on
interest
on
this
account
the
government
were
glad
to
recall
them
so
as
to
have
at
hand
a
valuable
resource
which
it
could
always
make
use
of
as
the
king
could
not
on
his
own
authority
levy
taxes
upon
the
vassals
of
feudal
lords
on
emergencies
he
convoked
the
barons
who
discussed
financial
matters
with
the
king
and
when
the
sum
required
was
settled
an
order
of
assessment
was
issued
and
the
barons
undertook
the
collection
of
the
taxes
the
assessment
was
always
fixed
higher
than
was
required
for
the
king
wants
and
the
barons
having
paid
the
king
what
was
due
to
him
retained
the
surplus
which
they
divided
amongst
themselves
the
creation
of
a
public
revenue
raised
by
the
contributions
of
all
classes
of
society
with
a
definite
sum
to
be
kept
in
reserve
thus
dates
from
the
reign
of
philip
augustus
the
annual
income
of
the
state
at
that
time
amounted
to
marks
or
pounds
weight
of

seventeen

of

augustus
for
that
monarch
legacies
were
very
considerable
one
of
his
last
wishes
deserves
to
be
mentioned
and
this
was
a
formal
order
which
he

ancient
custom
had
maintained
a
tax
exceptionally
in
the
following
cases
when
a
noble
dubbed
his
son
a
knight
or
gave
his
daughter
in
marriage
when
he
had
to
pay
a

and
when
he
set
out
on

against

king
louis
by
granting
legal
power
to

tried
to
bring
it
back
to
the
true
principles
of
justice
and
humanity
he
was
however
none
the
less
jealous
of
his
own
personal
privileges

as
regarded

insisted
that
coining
should
be

carried
on
in
his

in
the
times
of
the
carlovingian
kings

he
required
every
coin
to
be
made
of
a
definite
standard

he
himself
fixed

he

there
arose
a

the
expression

of
the
masses
began
to
take
the

the

kingdom
was
sadly
in
want
of
money
he
alienated
the
state
revenues
he
levied
excise
duties
and
subsidies
in
the
provinces
which
remained
faithful
to
his
cause
and
he
borrowed
largely
from
those
members
of
the
church
and
the
nobility
who
manifested
a
generous
pity
for
the
sad
destiny
of
the
king
and
the
monarchy
many
persons
however
instead
of
sacrificing
themselves
for
their
king
and
country
made
conditions
with
him
taking
advantage
of
his
position
the
heir
to
the
throne
was
obliged
in
many
points
to
give
way
either
to
a
noble
whose
services
he
bargained
for
or
to
a
town
or
an
abbey
whose
aid
he
sought
at
times
he
bought
over
influential
bodies
such
as
universities
and
other
corporation
by
granting
exemptions
from
or
privileges
in
matters
of
taxation
so
much
was
this
the
case
that
it
may
be
said
that
charles
vii
treated
by
private
contract
for
the
recovery
of
the
inheritances
of
his
fathers
the
towns
of
paris
and
rouen
as
well
as
the
provinces
of
brittany
languedoc
normandy
and
guyenne

returned

allegiance

the

less
advantageous

charles
vii
reconquered
his
kingdom
by
a
good
and
wise
policy
as
much
as
by
arms
he
doubtless
had
cause
to
be
thankful
for
the
valeur
and
devotion
of
his
officers
but
he
principally
owed
the
success
of
his
cause
to
one
man
namely
his
treasurer
the
famous
jacques
coeur
who
possessed
the
faculty
of
always
supplying
money
to
his
master
and
at
the
same
time
of
enriching
himself
fig
thus
it
was
that
charles
whose
finances
had
been
restored
by
the
genius
of
jacques
coeur
was
at
last
able
to
his
capital
triumphantly
to
emancipate
guyenne
normandy
and
the
banks
of
the
loire
from
the
english
yoke
to
reattach
to
the
crown
a
portion
of
its
former
possessions
or
to
open
the
way
for
their
early
return
to
remove
bold
usurpers
from
high
places
in
the
state
and
to
bring
about
a
real
alleviation
of
those
evils
which
his
subjects
had
so
courageously
borne
he
suppressed
the
fraud
and
extortion
carried
on
under
the
name
of
justice
put
a
stop
to
the
sale
of
offices
abolished
a
number
of
rates
illegally
levied
required
that
the
receivers
accounts
should
be
sent
in
biennially
and
whilst
regulating
the
taxation
he
devoted
its
proceeds
entirely
to
the
maintenance
and
pay
of
the
army
from
that
time
taxation
once
feudal
and
arbitrary
became
a
fixed
royal
due
which
was
the
surest
means
of
preventing
the
pillage
and
the
excesses
of
the
soldiery
to
which
the
country
people
had
been
subjected
for
many
years
important
triumphs
of
freedom
were
thus
obtained
over
the
tyrannical
supremacy
of
the
great
vassals
but
in
the
midst
of
all
this
improvement
we
can
not
but
regret
that
the
assessors
who
from
the
time
of
their
creation
by
louis
had
been
elected
by
the
towns
or
the
corporations
now
became
the
nominees
of
the
crown

the

taxed

but
little
therefore
says
philippe
de
commines
they
became
very
wealthy
and
lived
in
much
comfort
but
louis
xi
did
not
imitate
him
his
first
care
was
to
reinstate
that
great
merchant
that
clever
financier
jacques
coeur
to
whom
as
much
as
to
joan
of
arc
the
kingdom
owed
its
freedom
and
whom
charles
for
the
most
contemptible
reasons
had
had
the
weakness
to
allow
to
be
judicially
condemned
louis
xi
would
have
been
very
glad
to
entrust
the
care
of
his
finances
to
another
jacques
coeur
for
being
sadly
in
want
of
money
he
ran
through
his
father
earnings
and
to
refill
his
coffers
he
increased
taxation
imposed
a
duty
on
the
importation
of
wines
and
levied
a
tax
on
those
holding
offices
a
revolution
broke
out
in
consequence
which
was
only
quenched
in
the
blood
of
the
insurgents
in
this
manner
he
continued
by
force
of
arms
to
increase
and
strengthen
his
own
regal
power
at
the
expense
of
feudalism
he
soon
found
himself
opposed
by
the
du
bien
formed
by
the
great
vassals
ostensibly
to
get
rid
of
the
pecuniary
burden
which
oppressed
the
people
but
really
with
the
secret
intention
of
restoring
feudalism
and
lessening
the
king
power
he
was
not
powerful
enough
openly
to
resist
this
and
appeared
to
give
way
by
allowing
the
leagued
nobles
immense
privileges
and
himself
consenting
to
the
control
of
a
sort
of
council
of
notables
appointed
to
superintend
matters
of
finance
far
from
acknowledging
himself
vanquished
however
he
immediately
set
to
work
to
cause
division
among
his
enemies
so
as
to
be
able
to
overcome
them
he
accordingly
showed
favour
towards
the
bourgeois
whom
he
had
already
flattered
by
granting
new
privileges
and
abolishing
or
reducing
certain
vexatious
taxes
of
which
they
complained
the
notables
appointed
to
control
his
financial
management
reformed
nothing
they
were
timid
and
docile
under
the
cunning
eye
of
the
king
and
practically
assisted
him
in
his
designs
for
in
a
very
few
years
the
taxes
were
increased
from
écus
about
francs
of
present
money
to
écus
about
francs
towards
the
end
of
the

louis
xi
wasted
nothing
on
luxury
and
pleasure
he
lived
parsimoniously
but
he
maintained
men
under
arms
and
was
ready
to
make
the
greatest
sacrifices
whenever
there
was
a
necessity
for
augmenting
the
territory
of
the
kingdom
or
for
establishing
national
unity
at

ruined

anne
de

eldest
sister
of
the

an
immediate
demand
was
made
for

of
the
evils
to
which
the
finance
ministers
had
subjected
the
unfortunate
people
the
olivier
le
dain
and
the
jean
doyat
were
almost
immediately
sacrificed
to
popular
resentment
six
thousand
swiss
were
subsidised
the
pensions
granted
during
the
previous
reign
were
cancelled
and
a
fourth
part
of
the
taxes
was
removed

opinion

thus
satisfied
the
assembled
the
bourgeois
here
showed
great
practical
good
sense
especially
in
matters
of
finance
they
proved
clearly
that
the
assessment
was
illegal
and
that
the
accounts
were
fictitious
inasmuch
as
the
latter
only
showed
livres
of
subsidies
whereas
they
amounted
to
three
times
as
much
it
was
satisfactorily
established
that
the
excise
the
salt
tax
and
the
revenues
of
the
public
lands
amply
sufficed
for
the
wants
of
the
country
and

charles
was
only
allowed

for
two
years
and
livres
for
the
expenses
of
the
festivities
of

coronation
on

being
dissolved
the

found
ample

breaking
through

engagements
she
had
entered

the

not
at
all
a

of
revival

the

it
may
be
stated
that

established

on

we
must
also

realised
the
sum
of

nearly
a

to
those
possessing
judicial

the
duty
of
dispensing
justice
was
specially
assigned
to
the
counts
who
had
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
quarrels
between
parties
and
to
inflict
penalties
there
was
a
count
in
each
district
and
in
each
important
town
there
were
besides
several
counts
attached
to
the
sovereign
under
the
title
of
counts
of
the
palace
an
honourable
position
which
was
much
sought
after
and
much
coveted
on
account
of
its
pecuniary
and
other
contingent
advantages
the
counts
of
the
palace
deliberated
with
the
sovereign
on
all
matters
and
all
questions
of
state
and
at
the
same
time
they
were
his
companions
in
hunting
feasting
and
religious
exercises
they
acted
as
arbitrators
in
questions
of
inheritance
of
the
crown
during
the
minority
of
princes
they
exercised
the
same
authority
as
that
which
the
constitution
gave
to
sovereigns
who
were
of
full
age
they
confirmed
the
nominations
of
the
principal
functionaries
and
even
those
of
the
bishops

gave
their

as

as
in

of
a

they
incurred
no

in
so
distinguished

a
community
at
first
the
legates
and
afterwards
the
ambassadors
the
bishops
and
the
dukes
or
commanders
of
the
army
were
usually
selected
from
the
higher
court
officials
such
as
the
counts
of
the
palace
whereas
the
forming
the
second
class
of
the

filled
inferior
though
very
honourable
and
lucrative
posts
of

administrative

the
legal
principle
of
power
was
closely
bound
up
with
the
possession
of
landed
property
the
subdivision
of
that
power
however
closely
followed
this
union
and
the
constant
ruin
of
some
of
the
nobles
rapidly
increased
the
power
of
others
who
absorbed
to
themselves
the
lost
authority
of
their
more
unfortunate
brethren
so
much
so
that
the
frank
kings
perceived
that
society
would
soon
escape
their
rule
unless
they
speedily
found
a
remedy
for
this
state
of
things
it
was
then
that
the
and
appeared
which
were
subjected
to
successive
revisions
and
gradual
or
sudden
modifications
necessitated
by
political
changes
or
by
the
increasing
exigencies
of
the
prelates
and
nobles
but
far
from
lessening
the
supremacy
of
the
king
the
national
customs
which
were
collected
in
a
code
extended
the
limits
of
the
royal
authority
and
facilitated
its
exercise
in
childebert
in
concert
with
his
decided
that
in
future
the
crime
of
rape
should
be
punished
with
death
and
that
the
judge
of
the
district
in
which
it
had
been
committed
should
kill
the
ravisher
and
leave
his
body
on
the
public
road
he
also
enacted
that
the
homicide
should
have
the
same
fate
it
is
just
to
quote
the
words
of
the
law
that
he
who
knows
how
to
kill
should
learn
how
to
die
robbery
attested
by
seven
witnesses
also
involved
capital
punishment
and
a
judge
convicted
of
having
let
a
noble
escape
underwent
the
same
punishment
that
would
have
been
inflicted
on
the
criminal
the
punishment
however
differed
according
to
the
station
of
the
delinquent
thus
for
the
of
sunday
a
salian
paid
a
fine
of
fifteen
sols
a
roman
seven
and
a
half
sols
a
slave
three
sols
or
his
back
paid
the
penalty
for
him
at
this
early
period
some
important
changes
in
the
barbaric
code
had
been
made
the
sentence
of
death
when
once
given
had
to
be
carried
out
and
no
arrangements
between
the
interested
parties
could
avert
it
a
crime
could
no
longer
be
condoned
by
the
payment
of
money
robbery
even
which
was
still
leniently
regarded
at
that
time
and
beyond
the
rhine
even
honoured
was
pitilessly
punished
by
death
we
therefore
can
not
have
more
striking
testimony
than
this
of
the
abridgment
of
the
privileges
of
the
frankish
aristocracy
and
of
the
progress
which
the
sovereign
power
was
making
towards
absolute
and
uncontrolled
authority
over
cases
of
life
and
death
by
almost
imperceptible
steps
roman

more
humane
and

christianity
engrafted
itself
into

licentiousness
was
considered
a
crime
crime
became
an
offence
against
the
king
and
society
and
it
was
in
one
sense
by
the
king
hand
that
the
criminals
received
punishment
from
the
time
of
the
baptism
of
clovis
the
church
had
much
to
do
with
the
of
the
penal
code
for
instance
marriage
with
a
a
an
aunt
or
a
niece
was
forbidden
the
travelling

nocturnal
dances
public
orgies
formerly
permitted
at
feasts
were
forbidden
as
being
profane
in
the
time
of
clotaire
the
prelates
sat
as
members
of
the
supreme
council
which
was
strictly
speaking
the
highest
court
of
the
land
having
the
power
of
reversing
the
decisions
of
the
judges
of
the
lower
courts
it
pronounced

with

king
and
from
these
decisions
there
was
no
appeal

no
longer
a
voice
in
the
election
of
the
magistrates
for
the
assemblies
of
did
not
meet
except
on
extraordinary
occasions
and
all
government
and
judicial
business
was
removed
to
the
supreme
and
often
capricious
arbitration
of
the
king
and
his
council
as
long
as
the
mayors
of
the
palace
of
austrasia
and
of
that
of
burgundy
were
only
temporarily
appointed
royal
authority
never
wavered
and
the
sovereign
remained
supreme
judge
over
his
subjects
suddenly
however
after
the
execution
of
brunehaut
who
was
sacrificed
to
the
hatred
of
the
feudal
lords
the
mayoralty
of
the
palace
became
a
life
appointment
and
in
consequence
the
person
holding
the
office
became
possessed
almost
of
supreme
power
and
the
rightful
sovereigns
from
that
time
practically
became
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
future
usurpers
of
the
crown
the
edict
of
to
which
the
ecclesiastical
and
state
nobility
were
parties
was
in
its
laws
and
customs
completely
at
variance
with
former
edicts
in
resuming
their
places
in
the
french
constitution
the
merovingian
kings
who
had
been
deprived
both
of
influence
and
authority
were
compelled
by
the
germanic
institutions
to
return
to
the
passive
position
which
their
predecessors
had
held
in
the
forests
of
germany
but
they
no
longer
had
like
the
latter
the
prestige
of
military
authority
to
enable
them
to
keep
the
position
of
judges
or
arbitrators
the
canons
of
the
council
of
paris
which
were
confirmed
by
an
edict
of
the
king
bearing
date
the
of
the
calends
of
november
upset
the
political
and
legal
system
so
firmly
established
in
europe
since
the
fifth
century
the
royal
power
was
shorn
of
some
of
its
most
valuable
prerogatives
one
of
which
was
that
of
selecting
the
bishops
lay
judges
were
forbidden
to
bring
an
ecclesiastic
before
the
tribunals
and
the
treasury
was
prohibited
from
seizing
intestate
estates
with
a
view
to
increasing
the
rates
and
taxes
and
it
was
decreed
that
jews
should
not
be
employed
in
collecting
the
public
taxes
by
these
canons
the
judges
and
other
officers
of
state
were
made
responsible
the
benefices
which
had
been
withdrawn
from
the
were
restored
the
king
was
forbidden
from
granting
written
orders
for
carrying
off
rich
widows
young
virgins
and
nuns
and
the
penalty
of
death
was
ordered
to
be
enforced
against
those
who
disobeyed
the
canons
of
the
council
thence
sprung
two
new
species
of
legislation
one
ecclesiastical
the
other
civil
between
which
royalty
more
and
more
curtailed
of
its
authority
was
compelled
for
many
centuries
to
struggle
amongst
the
germanic
nations
the
right
of
justice
was
inherent
to
landed
property
from
the
earliest
times
and
this
right
had
reference
to
things
as
well
as
to
persons
it
was
the
patronage
of
the
proprietor
and
this
patronage
eventually
gave
origin
to
feudal
jurisdictions
and
to
lordly
and
customary
rights
in
each
domain
we
may
infer
from
this
that
under
the
two
first
dynasties
laws
were
made
by
individuals
and
that
each
lord
so
to
speak
made
his
own
the
right
of
jurisdiction
seems
to
have
been
so
inherent
to
the
right
of
property
that
a
landed
proprietor
could
always
put
an
end
to
feuds
and
personal
quarrels
could
temporarily
bring
any
lawsuit
to
a
close
and
by
issuing
his
stop
the
course
of
the
law
in
his
own
immediate
neighbourhood
at
least
within
a
given
circumference
of
his
residence
this
was
often
done
during
any
family
festival
or
any
civil
or
religious
public
ceremony
on
these
occasions
whoever
infringed
the
of
the
master
was
liable
to
be
brought
before
his
and
to
have
to
pay
a
fine
the
lord
who
was
too
poor
to
create
a
court
of
sufficient
power
and
importance
obtained
assistance
from
his
lord

or
relinquished
the
right
of
justice
to
him

originated
the
saying
the
fief
is
one
thing
and
justice

in

must
hence
conclude
that
the
landlord

was
exercised
indiscriminately
on
the
serfs
the
colons
and
the
vassals
and
a
statute
of
places

who
resided
with

persons
from
these
various
sources
we
discover
a
curious
fact
which
has
hitherto
remained
unnoticed
by
historians
namely
that
there
existed
an
intermediate
legislation
between
the
official
court
of
the
count
and
his
subordinates
and
the
private
courts
which
was
a
kind
of
court
of
arbitration
exercised
by
the
neighbours
without
the
assistance
of
the
judges
of
the
county
and
this
was
invested
with
a
sort
of
authority
which
rendered

decisions

they
examined

this

was
no
doubt
flattering
to
human

unfortunately
it
gave
rise
to
abuses

it
was

would
be
avoided

calling

as

as
the

court
was

movable
one
the
king
carried
about
with
him
the
original
text
of
the
law
in
rolls
it
was
in
consequence
of
the
seizure
of
a
number
of
these
by
the
english
during
the
reign
of
philip
augustus
in
that
the
idea
was
suggested
of
preserving
the
text
of
all
the
laws
as
state
archives
and
of
opening
authentic
registers
of
decisions
in
civil
and
criminal
cases
as
early
as
the
time
of
charles
the
bald
the
inconvenience
was
felt
of
the
high
court
of
the
count
being
movable
from
place
to
place
and
having
no
special
locality
where
instructions
might
be
given
as
to
modes
of
procedure
for
the
hearing
of
witnesses
and
for
keeping
the
accused
in
custody
a
former
statute
provided
for
this
probable
difficulty
but
there
seems
to
be
no
proof
that
previous
to
the
twelfth
century
any
fixed
courts
of
justice
had
been
established
the
kings
and
likewise
the
counts
held
courts
in
the

at
the

to
the
palace

or
in
some
other
public

in

before
starting

established
bailiwicks
which
held
their
assizes
once
a
month
during
their
sitting
they
heard
all
those
who
had
complaints
to
make
and
gave
summary
judgment
the
bailiff
assize
was
held
at
stated
periods
from
time
to
time
and
at
a
fixed
place
it
was
composed
of
five
judges
the
king
deciding
the
number
and
quality
of
the
persons
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
deliberations
of
the
court
for
each
session
the
royal
court
only
sat
when
it
pleased
the
king
to
order
it
it
accompanied
the
king
wherever
he
went
so
that
it
had
no
settled
place
of
residence
louis
ix
ordered
that
the
courts
of
the
nobles
should
be
consolidated
with
the
king
court
and
succeeded
in
carrying
out
this
reform
the
bailiffs
who
were
the
direct
delegates
of
the
sovereign
power
assumed
an
authority
before
which
even
the
feudal
lord
was
obliged
to
bend
because
this
authority
was
supported
by
the
people
who
were
at
that
time
organized
in
corporations
and
these
corporations
were
again
bound
together
in
communes
under
the
bailiffs
a
system
was
developed
the
principles
of
which
more
nearly
resembled
the
roman
legislation
than
the
right
of
custom
which
it
nevertheless
respected
and
the
judicial
trial
by
duel
completely
disappeared
inquiries
and
appeals
were
much
resorted
to
in
all
kinds
of
proceedings
and
louis
ix
succeeded
in
controlling
the
power
of
ecclesiastical
courts
which
had
been
much
abused
in
reference
to
excommunication
he
also
suppressed
the
arbitrary
and
ruinous
confiscations
which
the
nobles
had
unjustly
made
on
their
vassals

defined
the
important
duties

the
bailiffs

at
the

time
specified
the
mode
in
which
proceedings
should
be
taken
it
also
regulated
the
duties

added
the
four
great
assizes

vermandois

and
of
mâcon
to
act
as
courts
of
final
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
nobles
philippe
le
bel
went
still
further
for
in
he
invited
all
those
who
possess
temporal
authority
in
the
kingdom
of
france
to
appoint
for
the
purpose
of
exercising
civil
jurisdiction
a
bailiff
a
provost
and
some
serjeants
who
were
to
be
laymen
and
not
ecclesiastics
and
if
there
should
be
ecclesiastics
in
the
said
offices
to
remove
them
he
ordered
besides
that
all
those
who
had
cases
pending
before
the
court
of
the
king
and
the
secular
judges
of
the
kingdom
should
be
furnished
with
lay
attorneys
though
the
chapters
as
well
as
the
abbeys
and
convents
were
allowed
to
be
represented
by
canons
desmaze
adds
this
really
amounted
to
excluding
ecclesiastics
from
judicial
offices
not
only
from
the
courts
of
the
king
but
also
from
those
of
the
nobles
and
from
every
place
in
which
any
temporal
jurisdiction
existed
at
the
time
of
his
accession
hugh
capet
was
count
of
paris
and
as
such
was
invested
with
judicial
powers
which
he
resigned
in
on
the
understanding
that
his
county
of
paris
after
the
decease
of
the
male
heirs
of
his
brother
eudes
should
return
to
the
crown
in
a
new
magistrate
was
created
called
the
provost
of
paris
whose
duty
it
was
to
give
assistance
to
the
bourgeois
in
arresting
persons
for
debt
this
functionary
combined
in
his
own
person
the
financial
and
political
chief
of
the
capital
he
was
also
the
head
of
the
nobility
of
the
county
he
was
independent
of
the
governor
and
was
placed
above
the
bailiffs
and
seneschals
he
was
the
senior
of
the
urban
magistracy
and
police
leader
of
the
municipal
troops
and
in
a
word
the
prefect
as
he
was
called
under
the
emperor
aurelian
or
the
first
magistrate
of
lutetia
as
he
was
still
called
under
clotaire
in
assessors
were
associated
with
the
provost
and
together
they
formed
a
tribunal
which
was
afterwards
known
as
the
châtelet
fig
because
they
assembled
in
that
fortress
the
building
of
which
is
attributed
to
julius
caesar
the
functions
of
this
tribunal
did
not
differ
much
from
those
of
the
royal
its
jurisdiction
embraced
quarrels
between
individuals
assaults
revolts
disputes
between
the
universities
and
the
students
and
improper
conduct
generally
in
consequence
of
which
the
provost
acquired
the
popular
surname
of
des
at
first
his
judgment
was
final
but
very
soon
those
under
his
jurisdiction
were
allowed
to
appeal
to
parliament
and
that
court
was
obliged
to
have
certain
cases
sent
back
for
judgment
from
the
châtelet
this
was
however
done
only
in
a
few
very
important
instances
notwithstanding
frequent
appeals
being
made
to
its
supreme
arbitration

those
of

were
no

that
its

increased
considerably
unfortunately
numerous
abuses
were
introduced
into

and
the
officers
of

were
suspended
on

of
the

two
councillors
of
the

sat
upon

philip

adopting
its

prescribed
fresh

were
naturally
framed
in

authorised

to
examine

twenty
years
later
on

decided

did
not
allow
that

the

should

more
numerous
than

the
latter
succeeded
in
completely
carrying
the
day
on
account
of
the
services
they
rendered
and
the
influence
which
their
knowledge
of
the

of
the
country
gave
them
as
for
centuries
the
sword
had
ruled
the
gown
so
since
the
emancipation
of
the
bourgeois
the
lawyers
had
become
masters
of
the
administrative
and
judicial
world
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
were
still
kept
in
a
somewhat
inferior
position
to
the
peers
and
barons
their
opinion
alone
predominated
and
their

the

to
write
the

entrusted
to
the

who
divided
among
themselves
the
gratuities
which
were
given
them
by
virtue
of
their
office
before
an
advocate
was
admitted
to
plead
he
was
required
to
take
oath
and
to
be
inscribed

the
parliament
as
then
established
was
somewhat
similar
in
its
character
to
that
of
the
old
national
representative
government
under
the
germans
and
franks
for
centuries
it
protected
the
king
against
the
undue
interference
of
the
spiritual
power
it
defended
the
people
against
despotism
but
it
often
lacked
independence
and
political
wisdom
and
it
was
not
always
remarkable
for
its
correct
appreciation
of
men
and
things
this
tribunal
although
supreme
over
all
public
affairs
sometimes
wavered
before
the
threats
of
a
minister
or
of
a
court
favourite
succumbed
to
the
influence
of
intrigues
and
adapted
itself
to
the
prejudices
of
the
times
we
see
it
in
moments
of
error
and
of
blindness
both
condemning
eminent
statesmen
and
leading
citizens
such
as
jacques
coeur
and
robertet
and
handing
over
to
the
executioner
distinguished
men
of
learning
and
science
in
advance
of
the
times
in
which
they
lived
because
they
were
falsely
accused
of
witchcraft
and
also
doing
the
same
towards
unfortunate
maniacs
who
fancied
they
had
dealings
with
the
devil

centuries
all
the
members

formed

of
the
council
of
state
which
was
divided
into
the

the

and
for
extraordinary
and
very
important
purposes
the

assembled
every
month
and
its
decisions
were
registered
from
this
arose
the
custom
of
making
a
similar
registration
in
parliament
confirming
the
decisions

they
had
been
formally

dates
from

year
and
is
of
a
very
important
character

and
decides
that
in
spiritual
matters
the
right
of
supremacy
does
not
belong
more
to

than
to
the

philippe

ordered

shall
attend
the
next
parliament
and

the
accounts
that
for

royal
authority
having
considerably
declined
the
powers
of

and
other
bodies
of
the
magistracy
so
increased
that
under
charles
vi
the
parliament
of
paris
was
bold
enough
to
assert
that
a
royal
edict
should
not
become
law
until
it
had
been
registered
in
parliament
this
bold
and
certainly
novel
proceeding
the
kings
nevertheless
did
not
altogether
oppose
as
they
foresaw
that
the
time
would
come
when
it
might
afford
them
the
means
of
repudiating
a
treaty
extorted
from
them
under
difficult
circumstances
fig
the
close
connection
which
existed
between
the
various
parliaments
and
their
political
functions
for
they
had
occasion
incessantly
to
interfere
between
the
acts
of
the
government
and
the
respective
pretensions
of
the
provinces
or
of
the
three
orders
naturally
increased
the
importance
of
this
supreme
magistracy
more
than
once
the
kings
had
cause
to
repent
having
rendered
it
so
powerful
and
this
was
the
case
especially
with
the
parliament
of
paris
in
this
difficulty
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
the
kings
acted
they
imperceptibly
curtailed
the
various
powers
of
the
other
courts
of
justice
they
circumscribed
the
power
of
the
parliament
of
paris
and
proportionately
enlarged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
great
bailiwicks
as
also
that
of
the
châtelet
the
provost
of
paris
was
an
auxiliary
as
well
as
a
support
to
the
royal
power
which
nevertheless
held
him
in
its
grasp
the
châtelet
was
also
a
centre
of
action
and
of
strength
which
counteracted
in
certain
cases
parliamentary
opposition
thence
arose
the
most
implacable
rivalries
and
dissensions
between
these
various
parties

it
is
curious
to
notice
with
what
ingenuity
and
how
readily
parliament
took
advantage
of
the
most
trifling
circumstances
or
of
charges
based
upon
the
very
slightest
grounds
to
summon
the
officers
of
the
châtelet
before
its
bar
on
suspicion
of
prevarication
or
of
outrages
against
religion
morals
or
the
laws
often
were
these
officers

the
provost
himself
summoned
to
appear
and
make
before
the
assembly
notwithstanding
which
they
retained
their
offices
more
than
once
an
officer
of
the
châtelet
was
condemned
to
death
and
executed
but
the
king
always
annulled
that
part
of
the
sentence
which
had
reference
to
the
confiscation
of
the
goods
of
the
condemned
thus
proving
that
in
reality
the
condemnation
had
been
unjust
although
for
grave
reasons
the
royal
authority
had
been
unable
to
save
the
victim
from
the
avenging
power
of

hugues
aubriot
the
provost
was
thus
condemned
to
imprisonment
for

had
abandoned
him

the

of
extraordinary
energy
and
of
great
force

character
the
blood
of
many
of

members
was
shed
on
the
scaffold
and
this
circumstance
must
ever
remain
a
reproach
to
the
judges
and
to
those
who
executed
their
cruel
sentences

matters
but
took
cognizance

debates
which
concerned

the
king
or
the
state
we
must
remark
here
that
advocates
were
only
allowed
to
speak
twice
in
the
same
cause
and
that
they
were
subjected
to
fine
or
at
least
to
remonstrance
if
they
were
tedious
or
indulged
in
needless
repetition
in
their
replies
and
especially
if
they
did
not
keep
carefully
to
the
facts
of
the
case
after
pleading
they
were
permitted
to
give
a
summary
in
writing
of
the
principal
points
of
importance
as
well
as
their
grounds
of
defence
charles
confirmed
these
orders
and
regulations
with
respect
to
advocates
and
added
others
which
were
no
less
important
among
which
we
find
a
provision
for
giving
legal
assistance
to
poor
and
destitute
persons
who
go
to

these
regulations
of
charles
also
limited
the
time
in
which
officers
of
justice
were
to
get
through
their
business
under
a
certain
penalty
they
also
proclaimed
that
the
king
should
no
longer
hear
minor
causes
and
that
whatever
might
be
the
rules
of
the
court
they
forbad
the
presidents
from
deferring
their
judgment
or
from
retarding
the
regular
course
of
justice
charles
before
he
became
insane

no
less
than
his
father
to
the
establishment

but
this

bringing

the

on

the

which
would
arise

six
months
passed

from

immediately
after

without

under

strict

was
enforced
upon

during

amidst
a

points
upon

we
notice
the

the
necessity
of
keeping

the
prohibition
to

from
receiving
either
directly
or

anything
in

from

in

the
forbidding
all

from
receiving
any

or
claiming
more
than
the
actual
expenses
of
a
journey
and
other
just
charges
the
great
charter
of
the
parliament
promulgated
in
april
was
thus
amended
confirmed
and
completed
by
this
code
of
charles
with
a
wisdom
which
can
not
be
too
highly
extolled
the
magistrature
of
the
supreme
courts
had
been
less
favoured
during
the
preceding
reign
louis
that
cautious
and
crafty
reformer
after
having
forbidden
ecclesiastical
judges
to
examine
cases
referring
to
the
revenues
of
vacant
benefices
remodelled
the
secular
courts
but
he
ruthlessly
destroyed
anything
which
offended
him
personally
for
this
reason
as
he
himself
said
he
limited
the
power
of
the
parliaments
of
paris
and
toulouse
by
establishing
to
their
prejudice
several
other
courts
of
justice
and
by
favouring
the
châtelet
where
he
was
sure
always
to
find
those
who
would
act
with
him
against
the
aristocracy
the
parliament
would
not
give
way
willingly
nor
without
the
most
determined
opposition
it
was
obliged
however
at
last
to
succumb
and
to
pass
certain
edicts
which
were
most
repugnant
to
it
on
the
death
of
louis
however
it
took
its
revenge
and
called
those
who
had
been
his
favourites
and
principal
agents
to
answer
a
criminal
charge
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
had
exposed
themselves
to
the
resentment
of
the
supreme
court
the
châtelet
in
its
judicial
functions
was
inferior
to
the
parliament
nevertheless
it
acquired
through
its
provost
who
represented
the
bourgeois
of
paris
considerable
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
supreme
court
in
fact
for
two
centuries
the
provost
held
the
privilege
of
ruling
the
capital
both
politically
and
financially
of
commanding
the
citizen
militia
and
of
being
chief
magistrate
of
the
city
in
the
court
of
audiences
a
canopy
was
erected
under
which
he
sat
a
distinction
which
no
other
magistrate
enjoyed
and
which
appears
to
have
been
exclusively
granted
to
him
because
he
sat
in
the
place
of
saint
saint
louis
justice
to
the
good
people
of
the
city

were
gradually
increased
to
the
number
of

hundred
and
twenty
as
early
as
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
they
acted
only
in
the
interior
of
the
capital
and
guarded
the
city
the
suburbs
and
the
surrounding
districts
whereas
the
mounted
sergeants
had
to
watch
over
the
safety
of
the
rural
parishes
and
to
act
throughout
the
whole
extent
of
the
provost
jurisdiction
and

paris
in
the
midst
of
the
changes
of
the
middle
ages
especially
after
the
communes
became
free
all
those
kings
who
felt
the
importance
of
a
strict
system
of
justice
particularly
louis
philippe
le
bel
and
charles
had
seen
the
necessity
of
compiling
a
record
of
local
customs
an
edict
of
orders
that
the
custom
shall
be
registered
in
writing
so
as
to
be
examined
by
the
members
of
the
great
council
of
the
parliament
nevertheless
this
important
work
was
never
properly
carried
out
and
to
louis
xii
is
due
the
honour
of
introducing
a
customary
or
usage
law
and
at
the
same
time
of
correcting
the
various
modes
of
procedure
upon
which
customs
and
usages
had
been
based
and
which
had
become
singularly
antiquated
since
the
edict
of
no
monarch
showed
more
favour
to
parliament
than
louis
xii
during
his
reign
of
seventeen
years
we
never
find
complaints
from
the
magistracy
for
not
having
been
paid
punctually
but
in
contrast
with
this
on
the
accession
of
francis
the
court
complained
of
not
having
been
paid
its
first
quarter
salary
from
that
moment
claims
were
perpetually
being
made
there
were
continually
delays
or
absolute
refusals
the
members
were
expecting
remuneration
for
their
services
in
order
absolutely
to
enable
them
to
support
their
families
and
households
we
can
thus
judge
of
the
state
of
the
various
minor
courts
which
being
less
powerful
than
the
supreme
tribunals
and
especially
than
that
of
paris
were
quite
unable
to
get
their
murmurings
even
listened
to
by
the
proper
authorities
this
sad
state
of
things
continued
and
in
fact
grew
worse
until
the
assembly
of
the
league
when
mayenne
the
chief
of
the
leaguers
in
order
to
gratify
the
parliament
promised
to
double
the
salaries

he
was

fulfil

various

if

secret
at

were
remarkable
for
being

on
the
monstrous
right
of
issuing
the
most
severe
sentences
with
closed
doors

of
executing

we
must
nevertheless
acknowledge
that
terrible
as
these
mysterious
institutions
were
the
general
credulity
the
gross
ignorance
of
the
masses
and
the
love
of
the
marvellous
helped
not
a
little
to
render
them
even
more
outrageous
and
alarming
than
they
really
were
marco
polo
the
celebrated
venetian
traveller
of
the
thirteenth
century
says
we
will
speak
of
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
this
prince
was
named
alaodin
he
had
a
lovely
garden
full
of
all
manner
of
trees
and
fruits
in
a
beautiful
valley
surrounded
by
high
hills
and
all
round
these
plantations
were
various
palaces
and
pavilions
decorated
with
works
of
art
in
gold
with
paintings
and
with
furniture
of
silk
therein
were
to
be
seen
rivulets
of
wine
as
well
as
milk
honey
and
gentle
streams
of
limpid
water
he
had
placed
therein
damsels
of
transcendent
beauty
and
endowed
with
great
charms
who
were
taught
to
sing
and
to
play
all
manner
of
instruments
they
were
dressed
in
silk
and
gold
and
continually
walked
in
these
gardens
and
palaces
the
reasons
for
which
the
old
man
had
these
palaces
built
were
the
following
mahomet
having
said
that
those
who
should
obey
his
will
should
go
to
paradise
and
there
find
all
kinds
of
luxuries
this
prince
wished
it
to
be
believed
that
he
was
the
prophet
and
companion
of
mahomet
and
that
he
had
the
power
of
sending
whom
he
chose
to
paradise
no
one
could
succeed
in
entering
the
garden
because
an
impregnable
castle
had
been
built
at
the
entrance
of
the
valley
and
it
could
only
be
approached
by
a
covered
and
secret
way
the
old
man
had
in
his
court
some
young
men
from
ten
to
twenty
years
of
age
chosen
from
those
inhabitants
of
the
hills
who
seemed
to
him
capable
of
bearing
arms
and
who
were
bold
and
courageous
from
time
to
time
he
administered
a
certain
drink
to
ten
or
twelve
of
these
young
men
which
sent
them
to
sleep
and
when
they
were
in
deep
stupor
he
had
them
carried
into
the
garden
when
they
awoke
they
saw
all
we
have
described
they
were
surrounded
by
the
young
damsels
who
sang
played
instruments
together
caressed
them
played
all
sorts
of
games
and
presented
them
with
the
most
exquisite
wines
and
meats
fig
so
that
these
young
men
satiated
with
such
pleasures
did
not
doubt
that
they
were
in
paradise
and
would
willingly
have
never
gone
out
of
it
again
at
the
end
of
four
or
five
days
the
old
man
sent
them
to
sleep
again
and
had
them
removed
from
the
garden
in
the
same
way
in
which
they
had
been
brought
in
he
then
called
them
before
him
and
asked
them
where
they
had
been
your
grace
lord
they
answered
have
been
in
paradise
and
then
they
related
in
the
presence
of
everybody
what
they
had
seen
there
this
tale
excited
the
astonishment
of
all
those
who
heard
it
and
the
desire
that
they
might
be
equally
fortunate
the
old
man
would
then
formally
announce
to
those
who
were
present
as
follows
saith
the
law
of
our
prophet
he
causes
all
who
fight
for
their
lord
to
enter
into
paradise
if
you
obey
me
you
shall
enjoy
that
happiness
by
such
words
and
plans
this
prince
had
so
accustomed
them
to
believe
in
him
that
he
whom
he
ordered
to
die
for
his
service
considered
himself
lucky
all
the
nobles
or
other
enemies
of
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
were
put
to
death
by
the
assassins
in
his
service
for
none
of
them
feared
death
provided
he
complied
with
the
orders
and
wishes
of
his
lord
however
powerful
a
man
might
be
therefore
if
he
was
an
enemy
of
the
old
man
he
was
sure
to
meet
with
an
untimely
end

in
his
story
which
we
translate
literally
from
the
original
written
in
ancient
french
the
venerable
traveller
attributes
the
origin
of
this
singular
system
of
exercising
power
over
the
minds
of
persons
to
a
prince
who
in
reality
did

keep
up
a
tradition
of
his
family
for
the
alaodin
herein
mentioned
is
no
other
than
a
successor
of
the
famous
hassan
son
of
ali
who
in
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
took
advantage
of
the
wars
which
devastated
asia
to
create
himself
a
kingdom
comprising
the
three
provinces
of
turkistan
djebel
and
syria
hassan
had
embraced
the
doctrine
of
the
ishmaelian
sect
who
pretended
to
explain
allegorically
all
the
precepts
of
the
mahometan
religion
and
who
did
away
with
public
worship
and
originated
a
creed
which
was
altogether
philosophical
he
made
himself
the
chief
exponent
of
this
doctrine
which
by
its
very
simplicity
was
sure
to
attract
to
him
many
people
of
simple
and
sincere
minds
attacked
by
the
troops
of
the
sultan
sindgar
he
defended
himself
vigorously
and
not
unsuccessfully
but
fearing
lest
he
should
fall
in
an
unequal
and
protracted
struggle
against
an
adversary
more
powerful
than
himself
he
had
recourse
to
cunning
so
as
to
obtain
peace
he
entranced
or
fascinated
probably
by
means
analogous
to
those
related
by
marco
polo
a
slave
who
had
the
daring
during
sindgar
sleep
to
stick
a
sharp
dagger
in
the
ground
by
the
side
of
the
sultan
head
on
waking
sindgar
was
much
alarmed
a
few
days
after
hassan
wrote
to
him
if
one
had
not
good
intentions
towards
the
sultan
one
might
have
driven
the
dagger
which
was
stuck
in
the
earth
by
his
head
into
his
bosom
the
sultan
sindgar
then
made
peace

of
the
ishmaelians

dynasty
lasted
for
one
hundred
and
seventy
years

castle
of
alamond
built
on
the
confines
of

on
the
top
of

high
mountain
surrounded
with
trees

having
been

usual
residence

of

successors

in
the
native
language
the

both

had
heard

pronounced
confounded

and
gave
the
name
of
man

the
to
the
ishmaelian
prince
at
that
time
inhabiting
the
castle
of

a
name
which
has
remained
famous
in
history
since
the
period
when
the
sire
de
joinville
published
his
mémoires
ancient
authors
call
the
subjects
of
hassan
heississini
assissini
various
forms
of
the
same
expression
which
in
fact
has
passed
into
french
with
a
signification
which
recalls
the
sanguinary
exploits
of
the
ishmaelians
in
seeking
for
the
etymology
of
this
name
one
must
suppose
that
haschichini
is
the
latin
transformation
of
the
arabic
word
hachychy
the
name
of
the
sect
of
which
we
are
speaking
because
the
ecstacies
during
which
they
believed
themselves
removed
to
paradise
were
produced
by
means
of
or
we
know
that
this
inebriating
preparation
extracted
from
hemp
really
produces
the
most
strange
and
delicious
hallucinations
on
those
who
use
it
all
travellers
who
have
visited
the
east
agree
in
saying
that
its
effects
are
very
superior
to
those
of
opium
we
evidently
must
attribute
to
some
ecstatic
vision
the
supposed
existence
of
the
enchanted
gardens
which
marco
polo
described
from
popular
tales
and
which
of
course
never
existed
but
in
the
imagination
of
the
young
men
who
were
either
mentally
excited
after
fasting
and
prayer
or
intoxicated
by
the
haschischa
and
consequently
for
a
time
lulled
in
dreams
of
celestial
bliss
which
they
imagined
awaited
them
under
the
guidance
of
hassan
and
his
descendants

had

that

for

long
made

such
objects
of

we
have
thus
seen
how
a
legion
of
fanatics
in
the
east
made
themselves
the
blind
and
formidable
tools
of
a
religious
and
political
chieftain
who
was
no
less
ambitious
than
revengeful
if
we
now
turn
our
attention
to
germany
we
shall
here
find
almost
at
the
same
period
a
local
institution
which
although
very
different
from
the
sanguinary
court
of
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
was
of
an
equally
terrible
and
mysterious
character
we
must
not
however
look
at
it
from
the
same
point
of
view
for
having
been
founded
with
the
object
of
furthering
and
defending
the
establishment
of
a
regular
social
state
which
had
been
approved
and
sanctioned
by
the
sovereigns
and
recognised
by
the
church
it
at
times
rendered
great
service
to
the
cause
of
justice
and
humanity
at
a
period
when
might
usurped
right
and
when
the
excesses
and
the
crimes
of
shameless
and
of
petty
tyrants
entrenched
in
their
impregnable
strongholds
were
but
too
often
made
lawful
from
the
simple
fact
that
there
was
no
power
to
oppose
them
the
secret
tribunal
of
westphalia
which
held
its
sittings
and
passed
sentence
in
private
and
which
carried
out
its
decrees
on
the
spot
and
whose
rules
laws
and
actions
were
enveloped
in
deep
mystery
must
unquestionably
be
looked
upon
as

of
the
most
remarkable
institutions

attributes

hands
it
would
be
difficult
to
state
exactly
at
what
period
this
formidable
institution
was
established
a
few
writers
and
amongst
these
sebastian
munster
wish
us
to
believe
that
it
was
founded
by
charlemagne
himself
they
affirm
that
this
monarch
having
subjugated
the
saxons
to
his
sway
and
having
forced
them
to
be
baptized
created
a
secret
tribunal
the
duties
of
which
were
to
watch
over
them
in
order
that
they
might
not
return
to
the
errors
of
paganism
however
the
saxons
were
incorrigible
and
although
christians
they
still
carried
on
the
worship
of
their
idols
figs
and
and
for
this
reason
it
is
said
by
these
authorities
that
the
laws
of
the
tribunal
of
westphalia
were
founded
by
charlemagne
it
is
well
known
that
from
the
ninth
to
the
thirteenth
century
all
that
part
of
germany
between
the
rhine
and
the
weser
suffered
under
the
most
complete
anarchy
in
consequence
of
this
and
of
the
increase
of
crime
which
remained
unpunished
energetic
men
established
a
rigorous
jurisdiction
which
to
a
certain
extent
suppressed
these
barbarous
disorders
and
gave
some
assurance
to
social
intercourse
but
the
very
mystery
which
gave
weight
to
the
institution
was
the
cause
of
its
origin
being
unknown
it
is
only
mentioned
and
then
cursorily
in
historical
documents
towards
the
early
part
of
the
fifteenth
century
this
court
of
judicature
received
the
name
of
or
which
means
vehmic
tribunal
the
origin
of
the
word
or
which
has
given
rise
to
many
scientific
discussions
still
remains
in
doubt
the
most
generally
accepted
opinion
is
that
it
is
derived
from
a
latin
expression
woe
is
me
the
special
dominion
over
which
the
vehmic
tribunal
reigned
supreme
was
westphalia
and
the
country
which
was
subjected
to
its
laws
was
designated
as

was
no
assembly
of
this

the

assuming

committed

on

summoned

the
initiation
of
a
free
judge
was
accompanied
by
extraordinary
formalities
the
candidate
appeared
bareheaded
he
knelt
down
and
placing
two
fingers
of
his
right
hand
on
his
naked
sword
and
on
a
rope
he
took
oath
to
adhere
to
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
holy
tribunal
to
devote
his
five
senses
to
it
and
not
to
allow
himself
to
be
allured
therefrom
either
by
silver

or
even
precious
stones
to
forward
the
interests
of
the
tribunal
above
everything
illumined
by

all
that
the

reaches
and
to
defend
them
against
everything
which
is
between
heaven
and

candidate
was
then
given

by
which

recognised

this

remained
unknown
and
nothing
even
in
the

of
the

leads
one
even
to
guess
what
it
was
and
every
hypothesis
on
this
subject
must
be
looked
upon
as
uncertain
or
erroneous
by
one
of
the
fundamental
statutes
of
the
terre
rouge
a
member
convicted
of
betraying
the
secrets
of
the
order
was
condemned
to
the
most
cruel
punishment
but
we
have
every
reason
for
asserting
that
this
sentence
was
never
carried
out
or
even
issued
against
a

case
alone
during

was
an
accusation
of
this
sort
made
and
that
proved
to
be
groundless
it
would
have
been
considered
the
height
of
treason
to
have
given
a

friend
the
slightest
hint
that
he
was
being
pursued
or
that
he
had
been
condemned
by
the
holy
vehme
in
order
that
he
might
seek
refuge
by
flight
and
in
consequence
of
this
there
was
a
general
mistrust
of
any
one
belonging
to
the
tribunal
so
much
so
that
a
brother
says
a
german
writer
often
feared
his
brother
and
hospitality
was
no
longer
possible
the
functions
of
free
judges
consisted
in
going
about
the
country
seeking
out
crimes
denouncing
them
and
inflicting
immediate
punishment

caught

were
held
at

but
it
appears
that
all
criminal
business
was
first
heard
in
public
and
could
only
be
subjected
to
a
secret
judgment
when
the
accused
had
failed
either
publicly
to
justify
himself
or
to
appear
in
person
when
three
free

caught
a
malefactor

him

at

seven

were
however
liable
to
be
appealed

the

might
at
the
sitting
appeal
either
to
what
was
termed
the
imperial
chamber
a
general
chapter
of
the
association
which
assembled
at
dortmund
or
and
this
was
the
more
frequent
custom
to
the
emperor
or
ruler
of
the
country
whether
he
were
king
prince
duke
or
bishop
provided
that
these
authorities
belonged

of

judgment
could
only
be
entrusted
to
members
of

who
in
their
turn
could
only
act

the
condemned
might
also
appeal

of

or
to

grand

the

never
had
any
communication

intercourse
with

we
must
not
forget
a
very
curious
privilege
which
in
certain
cases
was
left
to
the
culprit
as
a
last
resource
he
might
appeal
to
the

and
solicit
an

the
of
the
association
was
generally
summoned
once
a
year
by
the
emperor
or
his
lieutenant
and
assembled
either
at
dortmund
or
arensberg
in
order
to
receive
the
returns
of
causes
judged
by
the
various

tribunals
to

the
changes
which
had
taken

among

order
to
receive
the
free
judges
to
hear
appeals
and
lastly
to
decide
upon
reforms
to
be
introduced
into
the
rules
these
reforms
usually
had
reference
to
the
connection
of
imperial
authority
with
the
members
of
the
secret
jurisdiction
and
were
generally
suggested
by
the
emperors
who
were
jealous
of
the
increasing
power
of
the
association
from
what
we
have
shown
on
the
authority
of
authentic
documents
we
understand
how
untrue
is
the
tradition
or
rather
the
popular
idea
that
the
was
an
assembly
of
bloodthirsty
judges
secretly
perpetrating
acts
of
mere
cruelty
without
any
but
arbitrary
laws
it
is
clear
on
the
contrary
that
it
was
a
regular
institution
having
it
is
true
a
most
mysterious
and
complex
organization
but
simply
acting
in
virtue
of
legal
prescriptions
which
were
rigorously
laid
down
and
arranged
in
a
sort
of
code
which
did
honour
to
the
wisdom
of
those
who
had
created
it
it
was
towards
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
centuries
that
the
vehmic
jurisdiction
reached
its
highest
degree
of
power
its
name
was
only
pronounced
in
a
whisper
and
with
trembling
its
orders
were
received
with
immediate
submission
and
its
chastisements
always
fell
upon
the
guilty
and
those
who
resisted
its
authority
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
but
that
the
westphalian
tribunal
prevented
many
great
crimes
and
public
misfortunes
by
putting
a
wholesome
check
on
the
nobles
who
were
ever
ready
to
place
themselves
above
all
human
authority
and
by
punishing
with
pitiless
severity
the
audacity
of
bandits
who
would
otherwise
have
been
encouraged
to
commit
the
most
daring
acts
with
almost
the
certainty
of
escaping
with
impunity
but
the
holy
vehme
blinded
by
the
terror
it
inspired
was
not
long
without
displaying
the
most
extravagant
assumption
of
power
and
digressing
from
the
strict
path
to
which
its
action
should
have
been
confined
it
summoned
before
its
tribunals
princes
who
openly
denied
its
authority
and
cities
which
did
not
condescend
to
answer
to
its
behests
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
free
judges
were
composed
of
men
who
could
not
be
called
of
unimpeachable
integrity
many
persons
of
doubtful
morals
having
been
raised
to
the
dignity
by
party
influence
and
by
money
the
partiality
and
the
spirit
of
revenge
which
at
times
prompted
their
judgments
were
complained
of
they
were
accused
of
being
open
to
corruption
and
this
accusation
appears
to
have
been
but
too
well
founded
it
is
known
that
according
to
a
feudal
practice
established
in
the
vehmic
system
every
new
free
judge
was
obliged
to
make
a
present
to
the
free
count
who
had
admitted
him
into
the
order
and
the
free
counts
did
not
hesitate
to
make
this
an
important
source
of
revenue
to
themselves
by
admitting
according
to
an

many
people

who
in

deserved

alleging
that

authorised
him
to
execute

justice
from
that
time
there
was
a
perpetual
cry
of
horror
and
indignation
against
a
judicial
institution
which
thus
interpreted
its
duties
and

the

undertook
the
suppression
of
these
secret
tribunals

idea
of
this
was
formed
by
the
electors
of
the
empire
at
the
diet
of
trèves
in
the
archbishop
of
cologne
succeeded
however
in
parrying
the
blow
by
convoking
the
of
the
order
on
the
plea
of
the
necessity
of
reform
but
besides
being
essentially
corrupt
the
holy
vehme
had
really
run
its
course
and
it
gradually
became
effete
as
by
degrees
a
better
organized
and
more
defined
social
and
political
state
succeeded
to
the
confused
anarchy
of
the
middle
ages
and
as
the
princes
and
free
towns
adopted
the
custom
of
dispensing
justice
either
in
person
or
through
regular
tribunals
its
proceedings
becoming
more
and
more
summary
and
rigorous
daily
gave
rise
to
feelings
of
greater
and
greater
abhorrence
the
common
saying
over
all
germany
was
they
first
hang
you
and
afterwards
inquire
into
your
innocence
on
all
sides
opposition
arose
against
the
jurisdiction
of
the
free
judges
princes
bishops
cities
and
citizens
agreed
instinctively
to
counteract
this
and
degenerate
institution
the
struggle
was
long
and
tedious
during
the
last
convulsions
of
the
expiring
holy
vehme
there
was
more
than
one
sanguinary
episode
both
on
the
side
of
the
free
judges
themselves
as
well
as
on
that
of
their
adversaries
occasionally
the
secret
tribunal
broke
out
into
fresh
signs
of
life
and
proclaimed
its
existence
by
some
terrible
execution
and
at
times
also
its
members
paid
dearly
for
their
acts
on
one
occasion
in
fourteen
free
judges
whom
kaspar
schwitz
count
of
oettingen
caused
to
be
seized
were
already
tied
up
in
bags
and
about
to
be
drowned
when
the
mob
pitying
their
fate
asked
for
and
obtained
their
reprieve
the
to
the
vehmic
tribunal
was
struck
by
its
own
hand
it
condenmed
summarily
and
executed
without
regular
procedure
an
inhabitant
of
munster
who
used
to
scandalize
the
town
by
his
profligacy
he
was
arrested
at
night
led
to
a
small
wood
where
the
free
judges
awaited
him
and
condemned
to
death
without
being
allowed
an
advocate
and
after
being
refused
a
respite
even
of
a
few
hours
that
he
might
make
his
peace
with
heaven
he
was
confessed
by
a
monk
and
his
head
was
severed
from
his
body
by
the
executioner

dating
from
this
tragical
event
which
excited
universal
indignation
the
authority
of
the
free
judges
gradually
declined
and
at
last
the
institution
became
almost
defunct
and
merely
confined
itself
to
occasionally
adjudicating
in
simple
civil
matters
we
must
not
omit
to
mention
the
council
of
ten
of
venice
when
speaking
on
the
subject
of
arbitrary
executions
and
of
tyrannical
and
implacable
justice
in
some
respects
it
was
more
notorious
than
the
vehmic
tribunal
exercising
as
it
did
a
no
less
mysterious
power
and
inspiring
equal
terror
though
in
other
countries
this
secret
tribunal
was
created
after
a
revolt
which
burst
on
the
republic
of
venice
on
the
of
june
at
first
it
was
only
instituted
for
two
months
but
after
various
successive
prorogations
it
was
confirmed
for
five
years
on
the
of
january
in
it
was
again
appointed
for
five
years
on
the
of
may
for
ten
years
more
and
at
last
was
established
permanently
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
authority
of
the
council
of
ten
was
consolidated
and
rendered
more
energetic
by
the
creation
of
the
inquisitors
of
state
these
were
three
in
number
elected
by
the
council
of
ten
and
the
citizens
on
whom
the
votes
fell
could
not
refuse
the
functions
which
were
thus
spontaneously
and
often
unexpectedly
assigned
to
them
the
authority
of
inquisitors
of
state
was
declared
to
be
unlimited
in
order
to
show
the
power
and
mode
of
action
of
this
terrible
tribunal
it
is
perhaps
better
to
make
a
few
extracts
from
the
code
of
rules
which
it
established
for
itself
in
june
this
document
several
manuscript
copies
of
which
are

formed

nevertheless
the

instituted

the

compromised
its
authority

the

to

authority

the

at

concealed
its
indignation
at

abuse

power

in
it
took
measures
so
as
considerably
to
restrain

to
observe
the
infinite
variety
of
tortures
which
have
existed
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
it
is
in
fact
difficult
to
realise
the
amount
of
ingenuity
exercised
by
men
in
inventing
new
tortures
in
order
to
give
themselves
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
their
agonizing
in
the
most
awful
sufferings
in
entering
upon
the
subject
of
ancient
modes
of
punishment
we
must
first
speak
of
the
torture
which
according
to
the
received
phrase
might
be
either
or
when
it
consisted
of
a
torture
which
the
condemned
had
to
endure
previous
to
capital
punishment
and
when
it
was
applied
in
order
to
elicit
from
the
culprit
an
avowal
of
his
crime
or
of
that
of
his
accomplices
it
was
also
called
or
according
to
the
duration
or
violence
with
which
it
was
inflicted
in
some
cases
the
torture
lasted
five
or
six
consecutive
hours
in
others
it
rarely
exceeded
an
hour
hippolyte
de
marsillis
the
learned
and
venerable
jurisconsult
of
bologna
who
lived
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
mentions
fourteen
ways
of
inflicting
torture
the
compression
of
the
limbs
by
special
instruments
or
by
ropes
only
injection
of
water
vinegar
or
oil
into
the
body
of
the
accused
application
of
hot
pitch
and
starvation
were
the
processes
most
in
use
other
means
which
were
more
or
less
applied
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
magistrate
and
the
tormentor
or
executioner
were
remarkable
for
their
singular
atrocities
for
instance
placing
hot
eggs
under
the
introducing
dice
between
the
skin
and
flesh
tying
lighted
candles
to
the
fingers
so
that
they
might
be
consumed
simultaneously
with
the
wax
letting
water
trickle
drop
by
drop
from
a
great
height
on
the
stomach
and
also
the
custom
which
was
according
to
writers
on
criminal
matters
an
indescribable
torture
of
watering
the
feet
with
salt
water
and
allowing
goats
to
lick
them
however
every
country
had
special
customs
as
to
the
manner
of
applying
torture
in
france
too
the
torture
varied
according
to
the
provinces
or
rather
according
to
the
parliaments
for
instance
in
brittany
the
culprit
tied
in
an
iron
chair
was
gradually
brought
near
a
blazing
furnace
in
normandy
one
thumb
was
squeezed
in
a
screw
in
the
ordinary
and
both
thumbs
in
the
extraordinary
torture
at
autun
after
high
boots
made
of
spongy
leather
had
been
placed
on
the
culprit
feet
he
was
tied
on
to
a
table
near
a
large
fire
and
a
quantity
of
boiling
water
was
poured
on
the
boots
which
penetrated
the
leather
ate
away
the
flesh
and
even
dissolved
the
bones
of
the
victim
at
orleans
for
the
ordinary
torture
the
accused
was
stripped
half
naked
and
his
hands
were
tightly
tied
behind
his
back
with
a
ring
fixed
between
them
then
by
means
of
a
rope
fastened
to
this
ring
they
raised
the
poor
man
who
had
a
weight
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
attached
to
his
feet
a
certain
height
from
the
ground
for
the
extraordinary
torture
which
then
took
the
name
of
they
raised
the
victim
with
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
attached
to
his
feet
to
the
ceiling
by
means
of
a
capstan
he
was
then
allowed
to
fall
several
times
successively
by
jerks
to
the
level
of
the
ground
by
which
means
his
arms
and
legs
were
completely
dislocated
fig
at
avignon
the
ordinary
torture
consisted
in
hanging
the
accused
by
the
wrists
with
a
heavy
iron
ball
at
each
foot
for
the
extraordinary
torture
which
was
then
much
in
use

were
always
present
feeling
the
pulse
at
the
temples
of
the
patient
so
as
to
be
able
to

moment
when

restoratives
were

as
soon
as
he

he
was
again
put

the
torture

went
on

for

was

acting
as

funnel
and
whilst
his

was
being
pinched
so
as
to
force
him
to
swallow

slowly
poured
four
about
nine

was

the

of
the
legs
were
literally
burst

which
were
often
used

were

also
recommends
that
the
hair
should
be
carefully
shaved
from
the
bodies
of
persons
about
to
undergo
examination
by
torture
for
fear
of
their
concealing
some
countercharm
which
would
render
them
insensible
to
bodily
pain
the
same
author
also
recommends
as
a
rule
when
there
are
several
persons
to
be
placed
on
the
rack
for
the
same
deed
to
begin
with
those
from
whom
it
would
be
most
probable
that
confession
would
be
first
extorted
thus
for
instance
when
a
man
and
a
woman
were
to
suffer
one
after
the
other
he
recommended
that
the
woman
be
first
tortured
as
being
the
weaker
of
the
two
when
a
father
and
son
were
concerned
the
son
should
be
tortured
in
presence
of
the
father
who
naturally
fears
more
for
his
son
than
for
himself
we
thereby
see
that
the
judges
were
adepts
in
the
art
of
adding
moral
to
physical
tortures
the
barbarous
custom
of
punishment
by
torture
was
on
several
occasions
condemned
by
the
church
as
early
as
we
find
from
pope
nicholas
letter
to
the
bulgarians
that
their
custom
of
torturing
the
accused
was
considered
contrary
to
divine
as
well
as
to
human
law
for
says
he
a
confession
should
be
voluntary
and
not
forced
by
means
of
the
torture
an
innocent
man
may
suffer
to
the
utmost
without
making
any
avowal
and
in
such
a
case
what
a
crime
for
the
judge
or
the
person
may
be
subdued
by
pain
and
may
acknowledge
himself
guilty
although
he
be
not
so
which
throws
an
equally
great
sin

on
them
it
is
said
that

chancellor
threw
them
under
the
table

token
of
contempt
the
executioner
was
generally
forbidden
to
live
within
the
precincts
of
the
city
unless
it
was
on
the
grounds
where
the
pillory
was
situated
and
in
some
cases
so
that
he
might
not
be
mistaken
amongst
the
people
he
was
forced
to
wear
a
particular
coat

red
or
yellow

his
duties
ensured
him
certain
privileges
in

he
possessed
the
right
of
which
consisted
in
taking
all
that
he
could
hold
in
his
hand
from
every
load
of
grain
which
was
brought
into
market
however
in
order
that
the
grain
might
be
preserved
from
ignominious
contact
he
levied
his
tax
with
a
wooden
spoon
he
enjoyed
many
similar
rights
over
most
articles
of
consumption
independently
of
benefiting
by
several
taxes
or
fines

as
the
toll
on
the

tax
on
foreign

and
the

sous
which
was
levied
on

pigs
see

and
lastly
besides
the
personal
property
of
the
condemned
he
received
the
rents
from
the
shops
and
stalls
surrounding
the
pillory
in
which
the
retail
fish
trade
was
carried
on
it
appears
that
in
consequence
of
the
receipts
from
these
various
duties
forming
a
considerable
source
of
revenue
the
prestige
of
wealth
by
degrees
dissipated
the
unfavourable
impressions
traditionally
attached
to
the
duties
of
executioner
at
least
we
have
authority
for
supposing
this
when
for
instance
in
we
see
the
paris
executioner
who
was
then
captain
of
the
bourgeois
militia
coming
in
that
capacity
to
touch
the
hand
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
on
the
occasion
of
his
solemn
entry
into
paris
with
queen
isabel
of
bavaria
we
may
add
that
popular
belief
generally
ascribed
to
the
executioner
a
certain
practical
knowledge
of
medicine
which
was
supposed
inherent
in
the
profession
itself
and
the
acquaintance
with
certain
methods
of
cure
unknown
to
doctors
was
attributed
to
him
people
went
to
buy
from
him
the
fat
of
culprits
who
had
been
hung
which
was
supposed
to
be
a
marvellous
panacea
we
may
also
remark
that
in
our
day
the
proficiency
of
the
executioner
in
setting
dislocated
limbs
is
still
proverbial
in
many
countries

more
than
once
during
the
thirteenth
century
the
duties
of
the
executioner
were
performed
by
women
but
only
in
those
cases
in
which
their
own
sex
was
concerned

this

a

arrived

but
before
entering
upon
the
details
of
this
revolting
subject
we
must
state
that
whatever
punishment
was
inflicted
upon
a
culprit
it
was
very
rare
that
its
execution
had
not
been
preceded
by
the
which
in
certain
cases
constituted
a
distinct
punishment
but
which
generally
was
but
the
prelude
to
the
torture
itself
the
which
was
called
or
took
place
without
the
assistance
of
the
executioner
in
the
council
chamber
where
the
condemned
bareheaded
and
kneeling
had
to
state
that
he
had
falsely
said
or
done
something
against
the
authority
of
the
king
or
the
honour
of
some
person
fig

the
honorable

the
condemned

the
rope
round
his
neck
followed
by
the
executioner
and
holding
in
his
hand
a
wax
taper
with
a
weight
which
was
definitely
specified
in
the
sentence
which
had
been
passed
upon
him
but
which
was
generally
of
two
or
four
pounds
prostrated
himself
at
the
door
of
a
church
where
in
a
loud
voice
he
had
to
confess
his
sin
and
to
beg
the
pardon
of
god
and
man
when
a
criminal
had
been
condemned
to
be
burnt
a
stake
was
erected
on
the
spot
specially
designed
for
the
execution
and
round
it
a
pile
was
prepared
composed
of
alternate
layers
of
straw
and
wood
and
rising
to
about
the
height
of
a
man
care
was
taken
to
leave
a
free
space
round
the
stake
for
the
victim
and
also
a
passage
by
which
to
lead
him
to
it
having
been
stripped
of
his
clothes
and
dressed
in
a
shirt
smeared
with
sulphur
he
had
to
walk
to
the
centre
of
the
pile
through
a
narrow
opening
and
was
then
tightly
bound
to
the
stake
with
ropes
and
chains
after
this
faggots
and
straw
were
thrown
into
the
empty
space
through
which
he
had
passed
to
the
stake
until
he
was
entirely
covered
by
them
the
pile
was
then
fired
on
all
sides
at
once
fig
sometimes
the
sentence
was
that
the
culprit
should
only
be
delivered
to
the
flames
after
having
been
previously
strangled
in
this
case
the
dead
corpse
was
then
immediately
placed
where
the
victim
would
otherwise
have
been
placed
alive
and
the
punishment
lost
much
of
its
horror
it
often
happened
that
the
executioner
in
order
to
shorten
the
sufferings
of
the
condemned
whilst
he
prepared
the
pile
placed
a
large
and
pointed
iron
bar
amongst
the
faggots
and
opposite
the
stake
breast
high
so
that
directly
the
fire
was
lighted
the
bar
was
quickly
pushed
against
the
victim
giving
a
mortal
blow
to
the
unfortunate
wretch
who
would
otherwise
have
been
slowly
devoured
by
the
flames
if
according
to
the
wording
of
the
sentence
the
ashes
of
the
criminal
were
to
be
scattered
to
the
winds
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
to
approach
the
centre
of
the
burning
pile
a
few
ashes
were
taken
in
a
shovel
and
sprinkled
in
the
air
they
were
not
satisfied
with
burning
the
living
they
also
delivered
to
the
flames
the
bodies
of
those
who
had
died
a
natural
death
before
their
execution
could
be
carried
out
as
if
an
anticipated
death
should
not
be
allowed
to
save
them
from
the
punishment
which
they
had
deserved
it
also
happened
in
certain
cases
where
a
person
guilt
was
only
proved
after
his
decease
that
his
body
was
disinterred
and
carried
to
the
stake
to
be
burnt
the
punishment
by
fire
was
always
inflicted
in
cases
of
heresy
or
blasphemy
the
spanish
inquisition
made
such
a
constant
and
cruel
use
of
it
that
the
expression
act
of
faith
strangely
perverted
from
its
original
meaning
was
the
only
one
employed
to
denote
the
punishment
itself
in
france
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
templars
were
burned
at
the
same
time
for
the
crimes
of
heresy
and
witchcraft
and
three
years
later
on
the
march
jacques
molay
and
a
few
other
dignitaries
of
the
order
of
the
templars
also
perished
in
the
flames
at
the
extremity
of
the
island
of
notre
dame
on
the
very
spot
where
the
equestrian
statue
of
henry
iv
now
stands
every
one
is
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
judges
were
found
iniquitous
enough
to
condemn
joan
of
arc
to
death
by
fire
as
a
witch
and
a
heretic
her
execution
which
took
place
in
the
of
rouen
is
remarkable
from
a
circumstance
which
is
little
known
and
which
had
never
taken
place
on
any
other
occasion
when
it
was
supposed
that
the
fire
which
surrounded
the
young
heroine
on
all
sides
had
reached
her
and
no
doubt
suffocated
her
although
sufficient
time
had
not
elapsed
for
it
to
consume
her
body
a
part
of
the
blazing
wood
was
withdrawn
in
order
to
remove
any
doubts
from
the
people
and
when
the
crowd
had
satisfied
themselves
by
seeing
her
in
the
middle
of
the
pile
chained
to
the
post
and
quite
dead
the
executioner
replaced
the
fire
it
should
be
stated
in
reference
to
this
point
that
joan
having
been
accused
of
witchcraft
there
was
a
general
belief
among
the
people
that
the
flames
would
be
harmless
to
her
and
that
she
would
be
seen
emerging
from
her
pile
unscathed
the
sentence
of
punishment
by
fire
did
not
absolutely
imply
death
at
the
stake
for
there
was
a
punishment
of
this
description
which
was
specially
reserved
for
base
coiners
and
which
consisted
in
hurling
the
criminals
into
a
cauldron
of
scalding
water
or
oil
we
must
include
in
the
category
of
punishment
by
fire
certain
penalties
which
were
so
to
speak
but
the
preliminaries
of
a
more
severe
punishment
such
as
the
in
which
the
hands
of
parricides
or
of
criminals
accused
of
high
treason
were
burned
we
must
also
add
various
punishments
which
if
they
did
not
involve
death
were
none
the
less
cruel
such
as
the
brazier
which
was
passed
backwards
and
forwards
before
the
eyes
of
the
culprit
until
they
were
destroyed
by
the
scorching
heat
and
the
process
of
branding
various
marks
on
the
flesh
as
an
ineffaceable
stigma
the
use
of
which
has
been
continued
to
the
present
day
in
certain
countries
decapitation
was
performed
with
an
axe
but
in
france
it
was
carried
out
usually
by
means
of
a
sword
or
glave
of
justice
which
was
furnished
to
the
executioner
for
that
purpose
fig
we
find
it
recorded
that
in
sixty
sous
parisis
were
paid
to
the
executioner
of
paris
for
having
bought
a
large
à
used
for
beheading
the
condemned
and
for
having
the
old
sword
done
up
which
was
damaged
and
had
become
notched
whilst
carrying
out
the
sentence
of
justice

luxembourg

originally
decapitation
was
indiscriminately
inflicted
on
all
criminals
condemned
to
death
at
a
later
period
however
it
became
the
particular
privilege
of
the
nobility
who
submitted
to
it
without
any
feeling
of
degradation
the
victim
unless
the
sentence
prescribed
that
he
should
be
blindfolded
as
an
ignominious
aggravation
of
the
penalty
was
allowed
to
choose
whether
he
would
have
his
eyes
covered
or
not
he
knelt
down
on
the
scaffold
placed
his
head
on
the
block
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
executioner
fig
the
skill
of
the
executioner
was
generally
such
that
the
head
was
almost
invariably
severed
from
the
body
at
the
first
blow
nevertheless
skill
and
practice
at
times
failed
for
cases
are
on
record
where
as
many
as
eleven
blows
were
dealt
and
at
times
it
happened
that
the
sword
broke
it
was
no
doubt
the
desire
to
avoid
this
mischance
that
led
to
the
invention
of
the
mechanical
instrument
now
known
under
the
name
of
the
which
is
merely
an
improvement
on
a
complicated
machine
which
was
much
more
ancient
than
is
generally
supposed
as
early
as
the
sixteenth
century
the
modern
guillotine
already
existed
in
scotland
under
the
name
of
the
and
english
historians
relate
that
lord
morton
regent
of
scotland
during
the
minority
of
james
had
it
constructed
after
a
model
of
a
similar
machine
which
had
long
been
in
use
at
halifax
in
yorkshire
they
add
and
popular
tradition
also
has
invented
an
analogous
tale
in
france
that
this
lord
morton
who
was
the
inventor
or
the
first
to
introduce
this
kind
of
punishment
was
himself
the
first
to
experience
it
the
guillotine
is
besides
very
accurately
described

chronicles
of

to
be

possibly
the
invention

by
the
desire

the

instead
of
prolonging
them

system
it
is
however
difficult
to
believe
that
the
mediæval
judges
were
actuated
by
any
humane
feelings
when
we
find
that
in
order
to
reconcile
a
respect
for
with
a
due
compliance
with
the
ends
of
justice
the
punishment
of
burying
alive
was
resorted
to
for
women
who
could
not
with
decency
be
hung
up
to
the
gibbets
in
a
woman
named
perette
accused
of
theft
and
of
receiving
stolen
goods
was
condemned
by
the
provost
of
paris
to
be
buried
alive
before
the
gallows
and
the
sentence
was
literally
carried
out
may
in
truth
be
considered
the
most
horrible
penalty
invented
by
judicial
cruelty
this
punishment
really
dates
from
the
remotest
ages
but
it
was
scarcely
ever
inflicted
in
more
modern
times
except
on
regicides
who
were
looked
upon
as
having
committed
the
worst
of
crimes
in
almost
all
cases
the
victim
had
previously
to
undergo
various
accessory
tortures
sometimes
his
right
hand
was
cut
off
and
the
mutilated
stump
was
burnt
in
a
cauldron
of
sulphur
sometimes
his
arms
thighs
or
breasts
were
lacerated
with
pincers
and
hot
oil
pitch
or
molten
lead
was
poured
into
the
wounds

after
these
horrible
preliminaries
a
rope
was
attached
to
each
of
the
limbs
of
the
criminal
one
being
bound
round
each
leg
from
the
foot
to
the
knee
and
round
each
arm
from
the
wrist
to
the
elbow
these
ropes
were
then
fastened
to
four
bars
to
each
of
which
a
strong
horse
was
harnessed
as
if
for
towing
a
barge
these
horses
were
first
made
to
give
short
jerks
and
when
the
agony
had
elicited
cries
from
the
unfortunate
man
who
felt
his
limbs
being
dislocated
without
being
broken
the
four
horses
were
all
suddenly
urged
on
with
the
whip
in
different
directions
and
thus
all
the
limbs
were
strained
at
one
moment
if
the
tendons
and
ligaments
still
resisted
the
combined
efforts
of
the
four
horses
the
executioner
assisted
and
made
several
cuts
with
a
hatchet
on
each
joint
when
at
last
for
this
horrible
torture
often
lasted
several
hours
each
horse
had
drawn
out
a
limb
they
were
collected
and
placed
near
the
hideous
trunk
which
often
still
showed
signs
of
life
and
the
whole
were
burned
together
sometimes
the
sentence
was
that
the
body
should
be
hung
to
the
gibbet
and
that
the
limbs
should
be
displayed
on
the
gates
of
the
town
or
sent
to
four
principal
towns
in
the
extremities
of
the
kingdom
when
this
was
done
an
inscription
was
placed
on
each
of
the
limbs
which
stated
the
reason
of
its
being
thus
exposed
the
is
the
name
applied
to
a
torture
of
very
ancient
origin
but
which
was
applied
during
the
middle
ages
to
quite
a
different
torture
from
that
used
in
olden
times
the
modern
instrument
might
indeed
have
been
called
the
cross
for
it
only
served
for
the
public
exhibition
of
the
body
of
the
criminal
whose
limbs
had
been
previously
broken
alive
this
torture
which
does
not
date
earlier
than
the
days
of
francis
is
thus
described
the
victim
was
first
tied
on
his
back
to
two
joists
forming
a
andrew
cross
each
of
his
limbs
being
stretched
out
on
its
arms
two
places
were
hollowed
out
under
each
limb
about
a
foot
apart
in
order
that
the
joints
alone
might
touch
the
wood
the
executioner
then
dealt
a
heavy
blow
over
each
hollow
with
a
square
iron
bar
about
two
inches
broad
and
rounded
at
the
handle
thus
breaking
each
limb
in
two
places
to
the
eight
blows
required
for
this
the
executioner
generally
added
two
or
three
on
the
chest
which
were
called
de
and
which
ended
this
horrible
execution
it
was
only
after
death
that
the
broken
body
was
placed
on
a
wheel
which
was
turned
round
on
a
pivot
sometimes
however
the
sentence
ordered
that
the
condemned
should
be
strangled
before
being
broken
which
was
done
in
such
cases
by
the
instantaneous
twist
of
a
rope
round
the
neck
strangling
thus
carried
out
was
called
this
method
is
still
in
use
in
spain
and
is
specially
reserved
for
the
nobility
the
victim
is
seated
on
a
scaffold
his
head
leaning
against
a
beam
and
his
neck
grasped
by
an
iron
collar
which
the
executioner
suddenly
tightens
from
behind
by
means
of
a
screw
for
several
centuries
and
down
to
the
revolution
hanging
was
the
most
common
mode
of
execution
in
france
consequently
in
every
town
and
almost
in
every
village
there
was
a
permanent
gibbet
which
owing
to
the
custom
of
leaving
the
bodies
to
hang
till
they
crumbled
into
dust
was
very
rarely
without
having
some
corpses
or
skeletons
attached
to
it
these
gibbets
which
were
called
or
because
they
represented
the
authority
of
the
law
were
generally
composed
of
pillars
of
stone
joined
at
their
summit
by
wooden
traverses
to
which
the
bodies
of
criminals
were
tied
by
ropes
or
chains
the
gallows
the
pillars
of
which
varied
in
number
according
to
the
will
of
the
authorities
were
always
placed
by
the
side
of
frequented
roads
and
on
an
eminence

montfaucon
originally
the
name
of
the
hill
soon
became
that
of
the
gallows
itself
this
celebrated
place
of
execution
consisted
of
a
heavy
mass
of
masonry
composed
of
ten
or
twelve
layers
of
rough
stones
and
formed
an
enclosure
of
forty
feet
by
or
thirty
at
the
upper
part
there
was
a
platform
which
was
reached
by
a
stone
staircase
the
entrance
to
which
was
closed
by
a
massive
door
fig
on
three
sides
of
this
platform
rested
sixteen
square
pillars
about
thirty
feet
high
made
of
blocks
of
stone
a
foot
thick
these
pillars
were
joined
to
one
another
by
double
bars
of
wood
which
were
fastened
into
them
and
bore
iron
chains
three
feet
and
a
half
long
to
which
the
criminals
were
suspended
underneath
between
these
and
the
platform
other
bars
were
placed
for
the
same
purpose
long
and
solid
ladders
riveted
to
the
pillars
enabled
the
executioner
and
his
assistants
to
lead
up
criminals
or
to
carry
up
corpses
destined
to
be
hung
there
lastly
the
centre
of
the
structure
was
occupied
by
a
deep
pit
the
hideous
receptacle
of
the
decaying
remains
of
the
criminals
one
can
easily
imagine
the
strange
and
melancholy
aspect
of
this
monumental
gibbet
if
one
thinks
of
the
number
of
corpses
continually
attached
to
it
and
which
were
feasted
upon
by
thousands
of
crows
on
one
occasion
only
it
was
necessary
to
replace
chains
which
were
useless
and
the
accounts
of
the
city
of
paris
prove
that
the
expense
of
executions
was
more
heavy
than
that
of
the
maintenance
of
the
gibbet
a
fact
easy
to
be
understood
if
one
recalls
to
mind
the
frequency
of
capital
sentences
during
the
middle
ages
montfaucon
was
used
not
only
for
executions
but
also
for
exposing
corpses
which
were
brought
there
from
various
places
of
execution
in
every
part
of
the
country
the
mutilated
remains
of
criminals
who
had
been
boiled
quartered
or
beheaded
were
also
hung
there
enclosed
in
sacks
of
leather
or
wickerwork
they
often
remained
hanging
for
a
considerable
time
as
in
the
case
of
pierre
des
essarts
who
had
been
beheaded
in
and
whose
remains
were
handed
over
to
his
family
for
christian
burial
after
having
hung
on
montfaucon
for
three
years
the
criminal
condemned
to
be
hanged
was
generally
taken
to
the
place
of
execution
sitting
or
standing
in
a
waggon
with
his
back
to
the
horses
his
confessor
by
his
side
and
the
executioner
behind
him

bore
three
ropes

so
to

him

when
the
cart
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
the
executioner
first
ascended
the
ladder
backwards
drawing
the
culprit
after
him
by
means
of
the
ropes
and
forcing
him
to
keep
pace
with
him
on
arriving
at
the
top
he
quickly
fastened
the
two
to
the
arm
of
the
gibbet
and
by
a
jerk
of
his
knee
he
turned
the
culprit
off

then
placed

tied
hands
of

condemned
and
suspending
himself
by
his
hands
to
the
gibbet
he
finished
off
his
victim
by
repeated
jerks
thus
ensuring
complete
strangulation

the
words
shall
be
hung

death
doth
ensue
are
to
be
found
in

certain
cases

only
carried
out
as
far
as
would
prove
to
the
culprit

awful
sensation
of
hanging
in
such
cases
the
victim
was
simply
suspended
by
ropes
passing
under
the
a
kind
of
exhibition
which
was
not
free
from
danger
when
it
was
too
prolonged

the
weight
of
the
body

tightened

the
chest

for
this
no

the

charge
was

he
then
paid
much

no

intelligible
to
us
notwithstanding
the
terror
which
they
formerly
created

their
very
strangeness
gives
us
reason
to
suppose
that
the
prison
system
was
at
that
time
subjected
to
the
most
odious
refinement
of
the
basest
cruelty
from
various
reliable
sources
we
learn
that
there
was
a
place
in
the
grand
châtelet
called
the
in
which
the
prisoners
had
their
feet
continually
in
water
and
where
they
could
neither
stand
up
nor
lie
down
and
a
cell
called
which
was
a
horrible
receptacle
of
filth
vermin
and
reptiles

to

gaoler

not
permitted
to

more

persons
in
the
same
bed
he
was
bound
to
give
bread
and
water
to
the
poor
prisoners
who
had
no
means
of
subsistence
and
lastly
he
was
enjoined
to
keep
the
large
stone
basin
which
was
on
the
pavement
full
of
water
so
that
prisoners
might
get
it
whenever
they
wished
in
order
to
defray
his
expenses
he
levied
on
the
prisoners
various
charges
for
attendance
and
for
bedding
and
he
was
authorised
to
detain
in
prison
any
person
who
failed
to
pay
him
the
power
of
compelling
payment
of
these
charges
continued
even
after

it
is
true
that
the
israelites
settled
down
in
the
neighbourhood
of

in
certain
narrow
streets
which
at
some
period
or
other
took
the
name
of

juiverie
old
but
they
were
never
distinct
from
the
rest
of

only
had
a

rather

most
of

had

a
share
of
immunities

rendering
their

a
little
less
precarious

their
occupations

a
rather
more
settled
character

in

in
consequence
of
their
having
been
on
several
occasions
useful
to
the
kings
of
those
two
countries

allowed
to
carry
on
their
trade

to
engage
in

their
own
quarters
a
few
were
elevated
to
positions
of
responsibility
and
some
were
even
tolerated
at
court
in
the
southern
towns
of
france
which
they
enriched
by
commerce
and
taxes
and
where
they
formed
considerable
communities
the
jews
enjoyed
the
protection
of

nobles

find
them
in

buying
and
selling
property
like

a
privilege
which
was
not
permitted
to
them
elsewhere
this
is
proved
by
charters
of
contracts
made
during
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
which
bear
the
signature
of

population
continually
threatened
the
jewish
quarters
which
public
opinion
pointed
to
as
haunts
and
sinks
of
iniquity
the
jews
were
believed
to
be
much
more
amenable
to
the
doctrines
of
the
talmud
than
to
the
laws
of
moses
however
secret
they
may
have
kept
their
learning

portion
of
its
tenets
transpired
which
was
supposed
to
inculcate
the
right
to
pillage
and
murder
christians
and
it
is
to
the
vague
knowledge
of
these
odious
prescriptions
of
the
talmud
that
we
must
attribute
the
readiness
with
which
the
most
atrocious
accusations
against
the
jews
were
always
welcomed
besides
this
the
public
mind
in
those
days
of
bigotry
was
naturally
filled
with
a
deep
antipathy
against
the
jewish
deicides
when
monks
and
priests
came
annually
in
holy
week
to
relate
from
the
pulpit
to
their
hearers
the
revolting
details
of
the
passion
resentment
was
kindled
in
the
hearts
of
the
christians
against
the
descendants
of
the
judges
and
executioners
of
the
saviour
and
when
on
going
out
of
the
churches
excited
by
the
sermons
they
had
just
heard
the
faithful
saw
in
pictures
in
the
cemeteries
and
elsewhere
representations
of
the
mystery
of
the
death
of
our
saviour
in
which
the
jews
played
so
odious
a
part
there
was
scarcely
a
spectator
who
did
not
feel
an
increased
hatred
against
the
condemned
race
hence
it
was
that
in
many
towns
even
when
the
authorities
did
not
compel
them
to
do
so
the
israelites
found
it
prudent
to
shut
themselves
up
in
their
own
quarter
and
even
in
their
own
houses
during
the
whole
of
passion
week
for
in
consequence
of
the
public
feeling
roused
during
those
days
of
mourning
and
penance
a
false
rumour
was
quite
sufficient
to
give
the
people
a
pretext
for
offering
violence
to
the
jews
in
fact
from
the
earliest
days
of
christianity
a
certain
number
of
accusations
were
always
being
made
sometimes
in
one
country
sometimes
in
another
against
the
israelites
which
always
ended
in
bringing
down
the
same
misfortunes
on
their
heads
the
most
common
and
most
easily
credited
report
was
that
which
attributed
to
them
the
murder
of
some
christian
child
said
to
be
sacrificed
in
passion
week
in
token
of
their
hatred
of
christ
and
in
the
event
of
this
terrible
accusation
being
once
uttered
and
maintained
by
popular
opinion
it
never
failed
to
spread
with
remarkable
swiftness
in
such
cases
popular
fury
not
being
on
all
occasions
satisfied
with
the
tardiness

forms
vented

enemies

was

the
report
was
suddenly
spread
that
a
child
of
the
name
of
hughes
had
been
enticed
into
the
jewish
quarter
and
there
scourged
crucified
and
pierced
with
lances
in
the
presence
of
all
the
israelites
of

district
who
were
convoked
and

to
take
part
in
this
horrible
barbarity
the
king
and
queen
of
england
on
their
return
from
a
journey
to
scotland
arrived
in

at
the
very
time
when
the
inhabitants
were
so
much
agitated
by
this
mysterious
announcement
the
people
called
for
vengeance
an
order
was
issued
to
the
bailiffs
and
officers
of
the
king
to
deliver
the
murderer
into
the
hands
of
justice
and
the
quarter
in
which
the
jews
had
shut
themselves
up
so
as
to
avoid
the
public
animosity
was
immediately
invaded
by
armed
men
the
rabbi
in
whose
house
the
child
was
supposed
to
have
been
tortured
was
seized
and
at
once
condemned
to
be
tied
to
the
tail
of
a
horse
and
dragged
through
the
streets
of
the
town
after
this
his
mangled
body
which
was
only
half
dead
was
hung

many
of
the
jews
ran
away
and
hid
themselves
in
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
and
those
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
caught
were
thrown
into
chains
and
led
to
london
orders
were
given
in
the
provinces
to
imprison
all
the
israelites
who
were
accused
or
even
suspected
of
having
taken
any
part
whether
actively
or
indirectly
in
the
murder
of
the
lincoln
child

suspicion
made
rapid
strides

days
in
a
short

of
time
eighteen
israelites
in
london
shared
the
fate
of
the
rabbi
of
their
community
in

some
dominican
monks
who
were
charitable
and
courageous
enough
to
interfere
in
favour
of
the
wretched
prisoners
brought
down
odium
on
their
own
heads
and
were
accused
of
having
allowed
themselves
to
be
corrupted
by
the
money
of
the
jews
prisoners
were
retained
in
the
dungeons
of
london
and
seemed
inevitably
fated
to
die
when
the
king
brother
richard
came
to
their
aid
by
asserting
his
right
over
all
the
jews
of
the
kingdom
a
right
which
the
king
had
pledged
to
him
for
a
loan
of
silver
marks
the
unfortunate
prisoners
were
therefore
saved

richard

does
not
tell
what

cost
them
but
we
must
hope
that
a
sense
of
justice
alone
guided
the
english
prince
and
that
the
jews
found
other
means
besides
money
by
which
to
show
their
gratitude
there
is
scarcely
a
country
in

which
can
not

the
murder
of
a
child
at

to
be
inflicted
on
several
jews
imputations
of
this
horrible
character
were
continually
renewed
during
the
middle
ages
and
were
of
very
ancient
origin

we
hear
of
them
in
the
times
of
honorius
and
theodosius
the
younger
we
find
them
reproduced
with
equal
vehemence

at
trent
where
a
furious
mob
was
excited
against
the
jews
who
were
accused
of
having
destroyed
a
child
months
old
named
simon
the
tale
of
the
martyrdom
of
this
child
was
circulated
widely
and
woodcut
representations
of
it
were
freely
distributed
which
necessarily
increased
especially
in
germany
the
horror
which
was
aroused
in

minds

poured

the
will
of
the
almighty
was
being

that
the

kings

princes
looked
upon
themselves
as
absolute
masters

lived
under
their
protection

they

condition
that
as
they
became
the
subjects
and
property
of
their
lord
the
latter
should
draw
his
best
income
from
them
we
have
shown
by
an
instance
borrowed
from
the
history
of
england
that
the
jews
were
often
mortgaged
by
the
kings

this
was
not
all
for
the
jews
who
inhabited
great
britain

the
reign
of
henry
in
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
were
not

obliged
to
acknowledge

large

the
service
the

had
rendered
them
in
clearing
them
from
the
imputation
of
having
had

in
the
murder
of
the

the

for
which
they
were

security
became

odious
extortions
from
them
the
king
had
pledged
them
to
the
earl
of
cornwall
for
marks
but
they
themselves
had
to
repay
the
royal
loan
by
means
of
enormous
taxes
when
they
had
succeeded
in
cancelling
the
king
debt
to
his
brother
that
necessitous
monarch

occasion

soon
after

son
having
rebelled
against
his
father
the
latter
took
back
his
jews
and
having
assembled
six
elders
from
each
of
their
communities
he
told
them
that
he
required
silver
marks
and
ordered
them
to
pay
him
that
sum
at
two
stated
periods
the
payments
were
rigorously
exacted
those
who
were
were
imprisoned
and
the
debtor
who
was
in
arrear
for
the
second
payment
was
sued
for
the
whole
sum

the
death
his
successor
continued
the
same
system
of
tyranny
against
the
jews
in
they
were
charged
with
having
issued
counterfeit
coin
and
on
this
vague
or
imaginary
accusation
two
hundred
and
eighty
men
and
women
were
put
to
death
in
london
alone
in
the
counties
there
were
also
numerous
executions

innocent
persons
were
thrown
into

in
king
edward
who
wished
to
enrich
himself
by
taking
possession
of
their
properties
banished
the
jews
from
his
kingdom
a
short
time
before
this
the
english
people
had
offered
to
pay
an
annual
fine
to
the
king
on
condition
of
his
expelling
the
jews
from
the
country
but
the
jews
outbid
them
and
thus
obtained
the
repeal
of
the
edict
of
banishment
however
on
this
last
occasion
there
was
no
mercy
shown
and
the
jews
sixteen
thousand
in
number
were
expelled
from
england
and
the
king
seized
upon
their
goods
at
the
same
period
philippe
le
bel
of
france
gave
the
example
of
this
system
of
persecuting
the
jews
but
instead
of
confiscating
all
their
goods
he
was
satisfied
with
taking
his
subjects

the
jews
often
took
the
precaution
of
purchasing
certain
rights
and
franchises
from
their
sovereign
or
from
the
feudal
lord
under
whose
sway
they
lived
but
generally
these
were
bargains
for
not
being
protected
by
common
rights
and
only
forming
a
very
small
part
of
the
population
they
could
nowhere
depend
upon
promises
or
privileges
which
had
been
made
to
them
even
though
they
had
purchased
them
with
their
own
money
to
the
uncertainty
and
annoyance
of
a
life
which
was
continually
being
threatened
was
added
a
number
of
vexatious
and
personal
insults
even
in
ordinary
times
and
when
they
enjoyed
a
kind
of
normal
tolerance
they
were
almost
everywhere
obliged
to
wear
a
visible
mark
on
their
dress
such
as
a
patch
of
gaudy
colour
attached
to
the
shoulder
or
chest
in
order
to
prevent
their
being
mistaken
for
christians
by
this
or
some
other
means
they
were
continually
subject
to
insults
from
the
people
and
only
succeeded
in
ridding
themselves
of
it
by
paying
the
most
enormous
fines
nothing
was
spared
to
humiliate
and
insult
them
at
toulouse
they
were
forced
to
send
a

to

good
friday

he
might
there

the
mob
assumed
the
right
of
attacking
the

with

the
jews
bought
off
this
right
in
by
paying
a
certain
sum
to
the
vicomte
de

by
promising

it
has
been
said
that
there
were
various
ancient
rates
levied
upon
jews
in
which
they
were
treated
like
cattle
but
this
requires
authentication
during
the
carnival
in
rome
they
were
forced
to
run
in
the
lists
amidst
the
jeers
of
the
populace
this
public
outrage
was
stopped
at
a
subsequent
period
by
a

a

from

presented
on

how
charitable

the
face

the
distressing
position
they
occupied
it
may
be
asked
what
powerful
motive
induced
the
jews
to
live
amongst
nations
who
almost
invariably
treated
them
as
enemies
and
to
remain
at
the
mercy
of
sovereigns
whose
sole
object
was
to
oppress
plunder
and
subject
them
to
all
kinds
of
vexations
to
understand
this
it
is
sufficient
to
remember
that
in
their
peculiar
aptness
for
earning
and
hoarding
money
they
found
or
at
least
hoped
to
find
a
means
of
compensation
whereby
they
might
be
led
to
forget
the
servitude
to
which
they
were
subjected
there
existed
amongst
them
and
especially
in
the
southern
countries
some
very
learned
men
who
devoted
themselves
principally
to
medicine
and
in
order
to
avoid
having
to
struggle
against
insuperable
prejudice
they
were
careful
to
disguise
their
nationality
and
religion
in
the
exercise
of
that

not
to
arouse
the
suspicion
of
their
patients
to
be
practitioners
from
lombardy
or
spain
or
even
from
arabia
whether
they
were
really
clever
or
only
made
a
pretence
of
being
so
in
an
art
which
was
then
very
much
a
compound
of
quackery
and
imposture
it
is
difficult
to
say
but
they
acquired
wealth
as
well
as
renown
in
its
practice
but
there
was
another
science
to
the
study
of
which
they
applied
themselves
with
the
utmost
ardour
and
perseverance
and
for
which
they
possessed
in
a
marvellous
degree
the
necessary
qualities
to
insure
success
and
that
science
was
the
science
of
finance
in
matters
having
reference
to
the
recovering
of
arrears
of
taxes
to
contracts
for
the
sale
of
goods
and
produce
of
industry
to
turning
a
royalty
to
account
to
making
hazardous
commercial
enterprises
lucrative
or
to
the
accumulating
of
large
sums
of
money
for
the
use
of
sovereigns
or
poor
nobles
the
jews
were
always
at
hand
and
might
invariably
be
reckoned
upon
they
created
capital
for
they
always
had
funds
to
dispose
of
even
in
the
midst
of
the
most
terrible
public
calamities
and
when
all
other
means
were
exhausted
when
all
expedients
for
filling
empty
purses
had
been
resorted
to
without
success
the
jews
were
called
in
often
in
consequence
of
the
envy
which
they
excited
from
being
known
to
possess
hoards
of
gold
they
were
exposed
to
many
dangers
which
they
nevertheless
faced
buoying
themselves
up
with
the
insatiable
love
of
gain
few
christians
in
the
middle
ages
were
given
to
speculation
and
they
were
especially
ignorant
of
financial
matters
as
demanding
interest
on
loans
was
almost
always
looked
upon
as
usury
and
consequently
such
dealings
were
stigmatized
as
disgraceful
the
jews
were
far
from
sharing
these
scruples
and
they
took
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
christians
by
devoting
themselves
as
much
as
possible
to
enterprises
and
speculations
which
were
at
all
times
the
distinguishing
occupation
of
their
race
for
this
reason
we
find
the
jews
who
were
engaged
in
the
export
trade
from
the
twelfth
to
the
fifteenth
centuries
doing
a
most
excellent
business
even
in
the
commercial
towns
of
the
mediterranean
we
can
to
a
certain
extent
in
speaking
of
the
intercourse
of
the
jews
with
the
christians
of
the
middle
ages
apply
what
lady
montague
remarked
as
late
as
when
comparing
the
jews
of
turkey
with
the
mussulmans
the
former
she
says
have
monopolized
all
the
commerce
of
the
empire
thanks
to
the
close
ties
which
exist
amongst
them
and
to
the
laziness
and
want
of
industry
of
the
turks
no
bargain
is
made
without
their
connivance
they
are
the
physicians
and
stewards
of
all
the
nobility
it
is
easy
to
conceive
the
unity
which
this
gives
to
a
nation
which
never
despises
the
smallest
profits
they
have
found
means
of
rendering
themselves
so

the
nobles

excluded
the

positions

it
continually
happened
that
a
positive
want
of
money
against
which
the
jews
were
ever
ready
to
provide
caused
a
repeal
or
modification
of
these
arbitrary
measures

christians
did
not
feel
any
scruple
in
parting
with
their
most
valued
treasures
and
giving
them
as
pledges
to
the
jews
for
a
loan
of
money
when
they
were
in
need

it
this
plan
of
lending
on
pledge

usury
belonged
specially
to
the
jews
in
europe
during
the
middle
ages
and
was
both
the
cause
of
their
prosperity
and
of
their
misfortune
of
their
prosperity
because
they
cleverly
contrived
to
become
possessors
of
all
the
coin
and
of
their
misfortune
because
their
usurious
demands
became
so
detrimental
to
the
public
welfare
and
were
often
exacted
with
such
unscrupulous
severity
that
people
not
unfrequently
became
exasperated
and
acts
of
violence
were
committed
which
as
often
fell
upon
the
innocent
as
upon
the
guilty
the
greater
number
of
the
acts
of
banishment
were
those
for
which
no
other
motive
was
assigned
or
at
all
events
no
other
pretext
was
made
than
the
usury
practised
by
these
strangers
in
the
provinces
and
in
the
towns
in
which
they
were
permitted
to
reside
when
the
christians
heard
that
these
rapacious
guests
had
harshly
pressed
and
entirely
stripped
certain
poor
debtors
when
they
learned
that
the
debtors
ruined
by
usury
were
still
kept
prisoners
in
the
house
of
their
pitiless
creditors
general
indignation
often
manifested
itself
by
personal
attacks
this
feeling
was
frequently
shared
by
the
authorities
themselves
who
instead
of
dispensing
equal
justice
to
the
strangers
and
to
the
citizens
according
to
the
spirit
of
the
law
often
decided
with
partiality
and
even
with
resentment
and
in
some
cases
abandoned
the
jews
to
the
fury
of
the
people
the

of
hatred
against
the
sordid
avarice
of
the

was
continually
kept

which
were

who

him
on

that
if
he
can
not
refund
it
on

day

lender
shall
have

all
the
evil
which
the
people
said
and
thought
of
the
jews
during
the
middle
ages
seems
concentrated
in
the
shylock
of
the
english
poet
the
rate
of
interest
for
loans
was
nevertheless
everywhere
settled
by
law
and
at
all
times
this
rate
varied
according
to
the
scarcity
of
gold
and
was
always
high
enough
to
give
a
very
ample
profit
to
the
lenders
although
they
too
often
required
a
very
much
higher
rate
in
truth
the
small
security
offered
by
those
borrowing
and
the
arbitrary
manner
in
which
debts
were
at
times
cancelled
increased
the
risks
of
the
lender
and
the
normal
difficulties
of
obtaining
a
loan
we
find
everywhere
in
all
ancient
legislations
a
mass
of
rules
on
the
rate
of
pecuniary
interest
to
be
allowed
to
the
jews

thus
acquired
a

to
grant
of
their

letters
of

to
persons
owing

to

were

even
at

thus
see
that
if
the

practised
usury
the
christians
and
especially
kings
and
powerful
nobles
defrauded
the

in
every
way

were

to

often
went

it
must

however
that
great
as

the

exclusively
devoted
themselves
to
financial
matters
when
they
were

to

they
were
well

to
become
artisans

a

in

success

to
excite
the

it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
jews
should
have
been
still
more
so
since
they
were
always
objects
of
hatred
and
abhorrence
we
find
a
touching
allegory
in
the
talmud
each
time
that
a
human
being
is
created
god
orders
his
angels
to
bring
a
soul
before
his
throne
and
orders
this
soul
to
go

which
is
about

be

soul
is
grieved
and
supplicates
the
supreme
being
to
spare
it
that
painful
trial
in
which
it
only
sees
sorrow
and
affliction
this
allegory
may
be
suitably
applied
to
a
people
who
have
only
to
expect
contempt
mistrust
and
hatred
everywhere
the
israelites
therefore
clung
enthusiastically
to
the
hope
of
the
advent
of
a
messiah
who
should
bring
back
to
them
the
happy
days
of
the
land
of
promise
and
they
looked
upon
their
absence
from
palestine
as
only
a
passing
exile
but
the
christians
said
to
them

messiah
has
long

had

mixed

as
secretly
as
possible
the

in
striving
to
convert
the
jews
repeatedly
had
conferences
with
the

to
quarrels

aggravated

community

succeeded
in
completely
detaching
a

individuals

a

creed
these
ardent
converts
rekindled
the
horror
of
the
people
against
their
former
by

of
the
precepts

sometimes
the
conversion

much
less

through

were

one
of

in

the
egyptians
agreed
to
restore
what

had
taken
and
the
restitution
was
made
but
perceiving
that
they
could
no
longer
do
any
good
for
themselves
in
this
province
they
struck
their
tents
and
started
for
rome
to
which
city
they
said
they
were
bound
to
go
not
only
in
order
to
accomplish
a
pilgrimage
imposed
upon
them
by
the
sultan
who
had
expelled
them
from
their
own
land
but
especially
to
obtain
letters
of
absolution
from
the
holy
father

at

imperial
passports
of
which
they
had
up
to
that
time
alone
boasted
they
pretended
to
have
in
their
possession
bulls
which
they
stated
that
they
had
obtained
from
the
pope
they
also
modified
their
original
tale
and
stated
that
they
were
descendants
of
the
egyptians
who
refused
hospitality
to
the
holy
virgin
and
to
joseph
during
their
flight
into
egypt
they
also
declared
that
in
consequence
of
this
crime
god
had
doomed
their
race
to
perpetual
misery
and
exile
five
years
later
we
find
them
in
the
neighbourhood
of
paris
the
sunday
after
the
middle
of
august
says
the
journal
of
a
bourgeois
of
paris
there
came
to
paris
twelve
pilgrims
that
is
to
say
a
duke
a
count
and
ten
men
all
on
horseback
they
said
that
they
were
very
good
christians
and
that
they
came
from
lower
egypt
and
on
the
of
august
the
anniversary
of
the
beheading
of
john
the
rest
of
the
band
made
their
appearance
these
however
were
not
allowed
to
enter
paris
but
by
order
of
the
provost
were
lodged
in
the
chapel
of
denis
they
did
not
number
more
than
one
hundred
and
twenty
including
women
and
children
they
stated
that
when
they
left
their
own
country
they
numbered
from
a
thousand
to
twelve
hundred
but
that
the
rest
had
died
on
the
road
whilst
they
were
at
the
chapel
never
was
such
a
concourse
of
people
collected
even
at
the
blessing
of
the
fair
of
landit
as
went
from
paris
denis
and
elsewhere
to
see
these
strangers
almost
all
of
them
had
their
ears
pierced
and
in
each
one
or
two
silver
rings
which
in
their
country
they
said
was
a
mark
of
nobility
the
men
were
very
swarthy
with
curly
hair
the
women
were
very
ugly
and
extremely
dark
with
long
black
hair
like
a
horse
tail
their
only
garment
being
an
old
rug
tied
round
the
shoulder
by
a
strip
of
cloth
or
a
bit
of
rope
fig
amongst
them
were
several
who
by
looking
into
people
hands
told
them
what
had
happened
or
what
was
to
happen
to
them
and
by
this
means
often
did
a
good
deal
to
sow
discord
in
families
what
was
worse
either
by
magic
by
satanic
agency
or
by
sleight
of
hand
they
managed
to
empty
people
purses
whilst
talking
to
them
so
at
least
every
one
said
at
last
accounts
respecting
them
reached
the
ears
of
the
bishop
of
paris
he
went
to
them
with
a
franciscan
friar
called
le
petit
jacobin
who
by
the
bishop
order
delivered
an
earnest
address
to
them
and
excommunicated
all
those
who
had
anything
to
do
with
them
or
who
had
their
fortunes
told
he
further
advised
the
gipsies
to
go
away
and
on
the
festival
of
they
departed
for
pontoise

in
the
cosmographie
universelle
of
munster
in
folio
basle
here
again
the
gipsies
somewhat
varied
their
story
they
said
that
they
were
originally
christians
but
that
in
consequence
of
an
invasion
by
the
saracens
they
had
been
forced
to
renounce
their
religion
that
at
a
subsequent
period
powerful
monarchs
had
come
to
free
them
from
the
yoke
of
the
infidels
and
had
decreed
that
as
a
punishment
to
them
for
having
renounced
the
christian
faith
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
return
to
their
country
before
they
had
obtained
permission
from
the
pope
they
stated
that
the
holy
father
to
whom
they
had
gone
to
confess
their
sins
had
then
ordered
them
to
wander
about
the
world
for
seven
years
without
sleeping
in
beds
at
the
same
time
giving
direction
to
every
bishop
and
every
priest
whom
they
met
to
offer
them
ten
livres
a
direction
which
the
abbots
and
bishops
were
in
no
hurry
to
obey
these
strange
pilgrims
stated
that
they
had
been
only
five
years
on
the
road
when
they
arrived
in
paris
enough
has
been
said
to
show
that
although
the
object
of
their
long
pilgrimage
was
ostensibly
a
pious
one
the
egyptians
or
gipsies
were
not
very
slow
in
giving
to
the
people
whom
they
visited
a
true
estimate
of
their
questionable
honesty
and
we
do
not
think
it
would
be
particularly
interesting
to
follow
step
by
step
the
track
of
this
odious
band
which
from
this
period
made
its
appearance
sometimes
in
one
country
and
sometimes
in
another
not
only
in
the
north
but
in
the
south
and
especially
in
the
centre
of
europe
suffice
it
to
say
that
their
quarrels
with
the
authorities
or
the
inhabitants
of
the
countries
which
had
the
misfortune
to
be
periodically
visited
by
them
have
left
numerous
traces
in
history
on
the
of
november
from
sixty
to
eighty
gipsies
coming
from
courtisolles
arrived
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
of
cheppe
near
the
strangers
many
of
whom
carried
javelins
darts
and
other
implements
of
war
having
asked
for
hospitality
the
mayor
of
the
town
informed
them
that
it
was
not
long
since
some
of
the
same
company
or
others
very
like
them
had
been
lodged
in
the
town
and
had
been
guilty
of
various
acts
of
theft
the
gipsies
persisted
in
their
demands
the
indignation
of
the
people
was
aroused
and
they
were
soon
obliged
to
resume
their
journey
during
their
unwilling
retreat
they
were
pursued
by
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
one
of
whom
killed
a
gipsy
named
martin

murderer

upwards
of
three
hundred
in
number
fell
upon
several
of
the
officers
who
were
stationed
to
prevent
their
entering
the
town
the
citizens
hurried
up
to
the
scene
of
disturbance
the
gipsies
retired
to
the
monastery
of
the
augustin
friars
in
which
they
fortified
themselves
the
bourgeois
besieged
them
and
would
have
committed
summary
justice
on
them
but
the
authorities
interfered
and
some
twenty
of
the
vagrants
were
arrested
but
they
sued
for
mercy
and
were
discharged

were

ransacked

lash
it
was
not

used
violence
or
openly
resisted
authority
they
more
frequently
had
recourse
to
artifice
and
cunning
in
order
to
attain
their
end
a
certain
captain
charles
acquired
a
great
reputation
amongst
them
for
the
clever
trickeries
which
he
continually
conceived
and
which
his
troop
undertook
to
carry
out
a
chronicler
of
the
time
says
that
by
means
of
certain
herbs
which
he
gave
to
a
horse
he
made
him
into
a
fat
and

animal
the
horse
was
then
sold
at
one
of
the
neighbouring
fairs
or
markets
but

purchaser
detected

fraud
within
a
week
for
the
horse

and
usually
sickened
and
died
tallemant
des

relates
that
on
one
occasion
captain
charles
and
his
attendants
took
up
their
quarters
in
a
village
the
curé
of
which
being
rich
and
parsimonious
was
much
disliked
by
his
parishioners
the
curé
never
left
his
house
and
the
gipsies
could
not
therefore
get
an
opportunity
to
rob
him
in
this
difficulty
they
pretended
that
one
of
them
had
committed
a
crime
and
had
been
condemned
to
be
hung
a
quarter
of
a
league
from
the
village
where
they
betook
themselves
with
all
their
goods
the
man
at
the
foot
of
the
gibbet
asked
for
a
confessor
and
they
went
to
fetch
the
curé
he
at
first
refused
to
go
but
his
parishioners
compelled
him
during
his
absence
some
gipsies
entered
his
house
took
five
hundred
écus
from
his
strong
box
and
quickly
rejoined
the
troop
as
soon
as
the
rascal
saw
them
returning
he
said
that
he
appealed
to
the
king
of
petite
upon
which
the
captain
exclaimed
ah
the
traitor
i
expected
he
would
appeal
immediately
they
packed
up
secured
the
prisoner
and
were
far
enough
away
from
the
scene
before
the
curé
his
house
tallemant
relates
another
good
trick
near
roye
in
picardy
a
gipsy
who
had
stolen
a
sheep
offered
it
to
a
butcher
for
one
hundred
sous
about
sixty
francs
of
our
money
but
the
butcher
declined
to
give
more
than
four
livres
for
it
the
butcher
then
went
away
whereupon
the
gipsy
pulled
the
sheep
from
a
sack
into
which
he
had
put
it
and
substituted
for
it
a
child
belonging
to
his
tribe
he
then
ran
after
the
butcher
and
said
give
me
five
livres
and
you
shall
have
the
sack
into
the
bargain
the
butcher
paid
him
the
money
and
went
away
when
he
got
home
he
opened
the
sack
and
was
much
astonished
when
he
saw
a
little
boy
jump
out
of
it
who
in
an
instant
caught
up
the
sack
and
ran
off
never
was
a
poor
man
so
thoroughly
hoaxed
as
this
butcher
says
tallemant
des
réaux
the
gipsies
had
thousands
of
other
tricks
in
stock
as
good
as
the
ones
we
have
just
related
in
proof
of
which
we
have
but
to
refer
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
their
own
tribe
who
under
the
name
of
pechon
de

published
towards
the
close
of
the
sixteenth
century

when
they
want
to
leave
a
place
where
they
have
been
stopping
they
set
out
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
they
are
going
and
after
travelling
about
half
a
league
they
take
their
right
course
they
possess
the
best
and
most
accurate
maps
in
which
are
laid
down
not
only
all
the
towns
villages
and
rivers
but
also
the
houses
of
the
gentry
and
others
and
they
fix
upon
places
of
rendezvous
every
ten
days
at
twenty
leagues
from
the
point
from
whence
they
set
out
the
captain

over
to

of
the

three

to
take

who
are
well
armed
and
mounted
he
sends
off
with
a
good
almanac
on
which
are
marked
all
the
fairs
and
they
continually
change
their
dress
and
their
horses
when
they
take
up
their
quarters
in
any
village
they
steal
very
little
in
its
immediate
vicinity
but
in
the
neighbouring
parishes
they
rob
and
plunder
in
the
most
daring
manner
if
they
find
a
sum
of
money
they
give
notice
to
the
captain
and
make
a
rapid
flight
from
the
place

counterfeit
money
and
put
it
into

at
all
sorts
of

buy
all
sorts
of
horses
whether
sound
or
unsound
provided
they
can
manage
to
pay
for
them
in
their
own
base
coin
when
they
buy
food
they
pay
for
it
in
good
money
the
first
time
as
they
are
held
in
such
distrust
but
when
they
are
about
to
leave
a
neighbourhood
they
again
buy
something
for
which
they
tender
false
coin
receiving
the
change
in
good
money
in

time
all
doors
are
shut
against
them
nevertheless
they
contrive
by

of
picklocks
and
other
instruments
to
effect
an
entrance
into
houses
when
they
steal
linen
cloaks
silver
and
any
other
movable
article
which
they
can
lay
their
hands
on
they
give
a
strict
account
of
everything
to
their
captain
who
takes
his
share
of
all
they
get
except
of
what
they
earn
by

are
very
clever
at
making
a
good
bargain
when
they

of

in
the
place

disguise
themselves
enter
into
communications
with
him
and
swindle
him

which
they
change

their

we
can
form
some
idea
says
the
german
historian
grellman
of
the
miserable
condition
of
the
gipsies
from
the
following
facts
many
of
them
and
especially
the
women
have
been
burned
by
their
own
request
in
order
to
end
their
miserable
state
of
existence
and
we
can
give
the
case
of
a
gipsy
who
having
been
arrested
flogged
and
conducted
to
the
frontier
with
the
threat
that
if
he
reappeared
in
the
country
he
would
be
hanged
resolutely
returned
after
three
successive
and
similar
threats
at
three
different
places
and
implored
that
the
capital
sentence
might
be
carried
out
in
order
that
he
might
be
released
from
a
life
of
such
misery
these
unfortunate
people
continues
the
historian
were
not
even
looked
upon
as
human
beings
for
during
a
hunting
party
consisting
of
members
of

german
court
the
huntsmen
had
no
scruple
whatever
in

as
they
would
have

francisque
michel
says
amongst
the
questions
which
arise
from
a
consideration
of
the
existence
of
this
remarkable
people
is
one
which
although
neglected
is
nevertheless
of
considerable
interest
namely
how
with
a
strange
language
unlike
any
used
in
europe
the
gipsies
could
make
themselves
understood
by
the
people
amongst
whom
they
made
their
appearance
for
the
first
time
newly
arrived
in
the
west
they
could
have
none
of
those
interpreters
who
are
only
to
be
found
amongst
a
people
and
who
have
political
and
commercial
intercourse
with
other
nations
where
then
did
the
gipsies
obtain
interpreters
the
answer
seems
to
us
to
be
clear
receiving
into
their
ranks
all
those
whom
crime
the
fear
of
punishment
an
uneasy
conscience
or
the
charm
of
a
roaming
life
continually
threw
in
their
path
they
made
use
of
them
either
to
find
their
way
into
countries
of
which
they
were

there
was
another
cause
which
greatly
contributed
to
diminish
the
power
as
well
as
the
prestige
of
this
eccentric
sovereign
and
this
was
that
the
the
and
not
finding
sufficient
means
of
livelihood
in
their
own
department
and
seeing
that
the
argotiers
on
the
contrary
were
always
in
a
more
luxurious
position
tried
to
amalgamate
robbery
with
mendicity
which
raised
an
outcry
amongst
these
sections
of
their
community
the
archisuppôts
and
the
cagoux
at
first
declined
such
an
alliance
but
eventually
they
were
obliged
to
admit
all
with
the
exception
of
the
who
were
altogether
excluded
in
the
seventeenth
century
therefore
in
order
to
become
a
thorough
argotier
it
was
necessary
not
only
to
solicit
alms
like
any
mere
beggar
but
also
to
possess
the
dexterity
of
the
and
the
thief
these
arts
were
to
be
learned
in
the
places
which
served
as
the
habitual
rendezvous

the
very
dregs
of
society

which
were

called

ailment
come

preserved

often
with
so
many

for
it

one
of
the
fundamental
rules
of

never
to
lay
by
anything
for
the

every
one
who
lives
there
indulges
in
the
utmost
licentiousness
both
religion
and
law
are
utterly
ignored
it
is
true
that
outwardly
they
appear
to
acknowledge
a
god
for
they
have
set
up
in
a
niche
an
image
of
god
the
father
which
they
have
stolen
from
some
church
and
before
which
they
come
daily
to
offer
up
certain
prayers
but
this
is
only
because
they
superstitiously
imagine
that
by
this
means
they
are
released
from
the
necessity
of
performing
the
duties
of
christians
to
their
pastor
and
their
parish
and
are
even
absolved
from
the
sin
of
entering
a
church
for
the
purpose
of
robbery
and
paris
the
capital
of
the

not

was
not

a

artificial
language
was
used
called
matoise
this
language
which
is
still
in
use
under
the
name
of
or
slang
had
for
the
most
part
been
borrowed
from
the
jargon
or
slang
of
the
lower
orders
to
a
considerable
extent
according
to
the
learned
philologist
of
this
mysterious
language
francisque
michel
it
was
composed
of
french
words
lengthened
or
abbreviated
of
proverbial
expressions
of
words
expressing
the
symbols
of
things
instead
of
the
things
themselves
of
terms
either
intentionally
or
unintentionally
altered
from
their
true
meaning
and
of
words
which
resembled
other
words
in
sound
but
which
had
not
the
same
signification
thus
for
mouth
they
said

bread
which
they
put
into
it

were
binders
an
ox

several
words
were
also
taken
from
the
ancient
language
of
the
gipsies
which
testifies
to
the
part
which
these
vagabonds
played
in
the
formation
of
the
argotic
community

was

mean
respectively
silver
castle
and
knife
from
what
we
have
related
about
rogues
and
the
cours
des
miracles
one
might
perhaps
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
france
was
specially
privileged
but
it
was
not
so
for
italy
was
far
worse
in
this
respect
the
rogues
were
called
by
the
italians
or
and
were
subdivided
into
more
than
forty
classes
the
various
characteristics
of
which
have
been
described
by
a
certain
rafael
frianoro
it
is
not
necessary
to
state
that
the
analogue
of
more
than
one
of
these
classes
is
to
be
found
in
the
short
description
we
have
given
of
the
argotic
kingdom
in
france
we
will
therefore
only
mention
those
which
were
more
especially
italian
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
in
the
southern
countries
where
religions
superstition
was
more
marked
than
elsewhere
the
numerous
family
of
rogues
had
no
difficulty
in
practising
every
description
of
imposture
inasmuch
as
they
trusted
to
the
various
manifestations
of
religions
feeling
to
effect
their
purposes
thus
the
in
order
to
obtain
more
alms
and
offerings
went
about
in
the
garb
of
monks
and
priests
even
saying
mass
and
pretending
that
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
exercised
their
sacred
office
so
the
walked
behind
a
donkey
carrying
a
bell
and
a
lamp
with
their
string
of
beads
in
their
hands
and
asking
how
they
were
to
pay
for
the
bell
which
they
were
always
just
going
to
buy
the
pretended
that
they
were
divinely
inspired
and
endowed
with
the
gift
of
second
sight
and
announced
that
there
were
hidden
treasures
in
certain
houses
under
the
guardianship
of
evil
spirits
they
asserted
that
these
treasures
could
not
be
discovered
without
danger
except
by
means
of
fastings
and
offerings
which
they
and
their
brethren
could
alone
make
in
consideration
of
which
they
entered
into
a
bargain
and
received
a
certain
sum
of
money
from
the
owners

deserve
mention
on
account
of
the
cleverness
with
which
they
contrived
to
assume
the
appearance
of
captives
recently
escaped
from
slavery
shaking
the
chains
with
which
they
said
they
had
been
bound
jabbering
unintelligible
words
telling
tales
of
their
sufferings
and
privations
and
showing
the
marks
of
blows
which
they
had
received
they
went
on
their
knees
begging
for
money
that
they
might
buy
off
their
brethren
or
their
friends
whom
they
said
they
had
left
in
the
hands
of
the
saracens
or
the
turks
we
must
mention
also
the
or
weepers
who
owed
their
name
to
the
facility
which
they
possessed
of
shedding
tears
at
will
and
the
who
pretending
to
be
seriously
ill
and
about

considered
that

was
due

the

fact
of

we
must
here
conclude
for
it

occupy
too
much
time
to
go
through
the
list
of
these
italian
vagabonds

for

we
may
simply
remark
that
no

exists
among
them

is
not
to
be
met
with
amongst
the
argotiers
of

the

in
giving
a
description
therefore
of
the
mendicity
practised
in
these
two
countries
during
the

ages
we
are
sure
to
be
representing
what
it
was
in
other

more

it

only
disconnected

it
is
probable
moreover
that

did
not
always
commit
their
depredations
singly
and
that
they
early
understood
the
advantages
of
associating

considerable

after

embraced
the

of

the
ingenious
and
amusing
tricks
of
which
they
were

of

know
that
this
charming
poet
who
was
at
the
same
time
a
most
expert
thief
narrowly
escaped
hanging
on
two
occasions
his
contemporaries
attributed
to
him
a
poem
of
twelve
hundred
verses
entitled
les

in
which
are
described
the
methods
in
use
among
his
companions
for
procuring
wine
bread
meat
and
fish
without
having
to
pay
for
them
they
form
a
series
of
interesting
stories
the
moral
of
which
is
to
be
gathered
from
the
following
lines

with
this
poem

yillon
we
ought
to
cite
one
of
a
later
period
la
légende
de
maître
faifeu
versified
by
charles
boudigné
this
faifeu
was
a
kind
of
villon
of
anjou
who
excelled
in
all
kinds
of
rascality
and
who
might
possibly
have
taught
it
even
to
the
gipsies
themselves
the
character
of
panurge
in
the
pantagruel
is
no
other
than
the
type
of
faifeu
immortalised
by
the
genius
of
rabelais
we
must
also
mention
one
of
the
pamphlets
of
guillaume
bouchet
written
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
which
gives
a
very
amusing
account
of
thieves
of
every
description
and
also
générale
des
larrons
in
which
are
related
numerous
wonderful
tales
of
murders
robberies
and
other
atrocities
which
made
our
admiring
ancestors
well
acquainted
with
the
heroes
of
the
grève
and
of
montfaucon
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
in
those
days
the
life
of
a
robber
who
pursued
his
occupation
with
any
degree
of
industry
and
skill
was
unattended
with
danger
for
the
most
harmless
were
hung
without
mercy
whenever
they
were
caught
the
fear
however
of
this
fate
did
not
prevent
the
de
la
from
performing
wonders
brantôme
relates
that
king
charles
ix
had
the
curiosity
to
wish
to
know
how
the
performed
their
arts
with
so
much
skill
and
dexterity
and
begged
captain
la
chambre
to
introduce
to
him
on
the
occasion
of
a
banquet
and
a
ball
the
cleverest
giving
them
full
liberty
to
exhibit
their
skill
the
captain
went
to
the
cours
des
miracles
and
fetched
ten
of
the
most
expert
of
these
thieves
whom
he
presented
to
the
king
charles
after
the
dinner
and
the
ball
had
taken
place
wished
to
see
all
the
plunder
and
found
that
they
had
absolutely
earned
three
thousand
écus
either
in
money
from
purses
or
in
precious
stones
pearls
or
other
jewels
some
of
the
guests
even
lost
their
cloaks
at
which
the
king
thought
he
should
die
of
laughter
the
king
allowed
them
to
keep
what
they
had
thus
earned
at
the
expense
of
his
guests
but
he
forbad
them
to
continue
this
sort
of
life
under
penalty
of
being
hung
and
he
had
them
enrolled
in
the
army
in
order
to
recompense
them
for
their
clever
feats
we
may
safely
assert
that
they
made
but
indifferent
soldiers

during

was
as
a
whole
closely
cemented
together
being
animated
by
the
same
sentiments
and
imbued
with
the
same
spirit
it
was
divided
as
we
have
already
stated
into
three
great
classes
namely
the
clergy
the
nobility
and
the
these
classes
each
of
which
formed
a
distinct
body
within
the
state
carried
on
an
existence
peculiar
to
itself
and
presented
in
its
collective
capacity
a
separate
individuality
hence
there
was
a
distinct
ceremonial
for
each
class
we
will
not
attempt
to
give
in
detail
the
innumerable
laws
of
these
three
kinds
of
ceremonial
our
attention
will
be
directed
solely
to
their
most
characteristic
customs
and
to
their
most
remarkable
and
interesting
aspects
taken
as
a
whole
we
must
altogether
lay
aside
matters
relating
specially
to
ceremonies
of
a
purely
religions
character
as
they
are
connected
more
or
less
with
the
traditions
and
customs
of
the
church
and
belong
to
quite
a
distinct
order
of
things
when
the
germans
and
especially
the
franks
says
the
learned
paleographer
vallet
de
viriville
had
succeeded
in
establishing
their
own
rule
in
place
of
that
of
the
romans
these
almost
savage
nations
and
the
barbarian
chiefs
who
were
at
their
head
under
the
title
of
kings
necessarily
borrowed
more
or
less
the
refined
practices
relating
to
ceremonial
possessed
by
the
people
whom
they
had
conquered
the
elevation
of
the
elected
chief
or
king
on
the
shield
and
the
solemn
taking
of
arms
in
the
midst
of
the
tribe
seem
to
be
the
only
traces
of
public
ceremonies
which
we
can
discover
among
the
grermans
the
marvellous
display
and
the
imposing
splendour
of
the
political
hierarchy
of
the
roman
empire
especially
in
its
outward
arrangements
must
have
astonished
the
minds
of
these
uncultivated
people
thus
we
find
the
frank
kings
becoming
immediately
after
a
victory
the
simple
and
clumsy
imitators
of
the
civilisation
which
they
had
broken
up
clovis
on
returning
to
tours
in
after
having
defeated
alaric
received
the
titles
of
and
from
the
emperor
anastasius
and
bedecked
himself
with
the
purple
the
chlamys
and
the
diadem
the
same
principle
of
imitation
was
afterwards
exhibited
in
the
internal
and
external
court
ceremonial
in
proportion
as
it
became
developed
in
the
royal
person
charlemagne
who
aimed
at
everything
which
could
adorn
and
add
strength
to
a
new
monarchy
established
a
regular
method
for
the
general
and
special
administration
of
his
empire
as
also
for
the
internal
arrangement
and
discipline
of
his
palace
we
have
already
referred
to
this
twofold
organization
chapters
on
private
life
and
on
food
but
we
may
here
remark
that
notwithstanding
these
ancient
tendencies
to
the
creation
of
a
fixed
ceremonial
the
trifling
rules
which
made
etiquette
a
science
and
a
law
were
introduced
by
degrees
and
have
only
very
recently
been
established
amongst
us
in
when
king
charles
vi
married
the
notorious
isabel
of
bavaria
then
scarcely
fourteen
years
of
age
he
desired
to
arrange
for
her
a
magnificent
entry
into
paris
the
pomp
and
brilliancy
of
which
should
be
consistent
with
the
rank
and
illustrious
descent
of
his
young
bride
he
therefore
begged
the
old
queen
blanche
widow
of
philippe
de
valois
to
preside
over
the
ceremony
and
to
have
it
conducted
according
to
the
custom
of
olden
times
she
was
consequently
obliged
in
the
absence
of
any
fixed
rules
on
the
subject
to
consult
the
official
records
that
is
to
say
the
chronique
du
monastère
de
the
first
embodiment
of
rules
relating
to
these
matters
in
use
among
the
nobility
which
had
appeared
in
france
under
the
title
of
honneurs
de
la
cour
only
goes
back
to
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
it
appears
however
that
even
then
this
was
not
generally
admitted
among
the
nobility
as
the
basis
of
ceremonial
for
in
we
find
that
nothing
had
been
definitely
settled
this
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
when
king
henri
iii
desired
to
know
the
rank
and
order
of
precedence
of
the
princes
of
the
royal
blood
both
dukes
and
counts
as
also
that
of
the
other
princes
the
barons
the
nobles
of
the
kingdom
the
constables
the
marshals
of
france
and
the
admirals
and
what
position
they
had
held
on
great
public
occasions
during
the
reigns
of
his
predecessors
he
commissioned
jean
du
tillet
the
civil
registrar
of
the
parliament
of
paris
to
search
among
the
royal
archives
for
the
various
authentic
documents
which
might
throw
light
on
this
question
and
serve
as
a
precedent
for
the
future
in
fact
it
was
henri
iii
who
in
created
the
office
of
grand
master
of
the
ceremonies
of
france
entrusting
it
to
guillaume
pot
a
noble
of
rhodes
which
office
for
many
generations
remained
hereditary
in
his
family

nevertheless
the
question
of
ceremonial
and
especially
that
of
precedence
had
already
more
than
once
occupied
the
attention
of
sovereigns
not
only
within
their
own
states
but
also
in
relation
to
diplomatic
matters
the
meetings
of
councils
at
which
the
ambassadors
of
all
the
christian
powers
with
the
delegates
of
the
catholic
church
were
assembled
did
not
fail
to
bring
this
subject
up
for
decision
pope
julius
ii
in
instructed
pierre
de
crassis
his
master
of
the
ceremonies
to
publish
a
decree
determining
the
rank
to
be
taken
by
the
various
sovereigns
of
europe
or
by
their
representatives
but
we
should
add
that
this
papal
decree
never
received
the
sanction
of
the
parties
interested
and
that
the
question
of
precedence
even
at
the
most
unimportant
public
ceremonies
was
during
the
whole
of
the
middle
ages
a
perpetual
source
of
litigation
in
courts
of
law
and
of
quarrels
which
too
often
ended
in
bloodshed
it
is
right
that
we
should
place
at
the
head
of
political
ceremonies
those
having
reference
to
the
coronation
of
sovereigns
which
were
not
only
political
but
owed
their
supreme
importance
and
dignity
to
the
necessary
intervention
of
ecclesiastical
authority
we
will
therefore
first
speak
of
the
consecration
and
coronation
of
the
kings
of
france
pépin
le
bref
son
of
charles
martel
and
founder
of
the
second
dynasty
was
the
first
of
the
french
kings
who
was
consecrated
by
the
religions
rite
of
anointing
but
its
mode
of
administration
for
a
long
period
underwent
numerous
changes
before
becoming
established
by
a
definite
law
thus
pépin
after
having
been
first
consecrated
in
in
the
cathedral
of
boissons
by
the
archbishop
of
mayence
was
again
consecrated
with
his
two
sons
charlemagne
and
carloman

charlemagne

twice
anointed
by

as
king

of

of

the
consecration
of
the
kings
of

sometimes
took
place
in
the
metropolitan
church
of
rheims
and
sometimes
in
other
churches
but
more
frequently
in
the
former
louis
vi
having
been
consecrated
in
the
cathedral
of
orleans
the
clergy
of
rheims
appealed
against
this
supposed
infraction
of
custom
and
their
own
special
privileges
a
long
discussion
took
place
in
which
were
brought
forward
the
titles
which
the
church
of
rheims
possessed
subsequently
to
the
reign
of
clovis
to
the
exclusive
honour
of
having
kings
consecrated
in
it
and
king
louis
le
jeune
son
of
louis
le
gros
who
was
himself
consecrated
at
rheims
promulgated
a
special
decree
on
this
question
in
anticipation
of
the
consecration
of
his
son
philippe
auguste
this
decree
finally
settled
the
rights
of
this
ancient
church
and
at
the
same
time
defined
the
order
which
was
to
be
observed
in
future
at
the
ceremony
of
consecration
from
that
date
down
to
the
end
of
the
reign
of
the
bourbons
of
the
elder
line
kings
were
invariably
consecrated
according
to
legal
rite
in
the
metropolitan
church
of
rheims
with
the
exception
of
henry
who
was
crowned
at
chartres
by
the
bishop
of
that
town
on
account
of
the
civil
wars
which
then
divided
his
kingdom

in

the
king
was
desirous
that
the
queen
should
make
a
public
entry
into
paris
and
this
he
made
known
to
the
inhabitants
in

that
they
should
make
preparations
for
it

there
were

crying
the

by
which
she
passed
was
covered
with

with

a
man
of
light

dressed
in
the
guise
of
an
angel
came
down
by

some

from
one
of
the
towers
of
to
the
said
bridge
through
an
opening
in
the
said
blue
taffeta
at
the
moment
when
the
queen
was
passing
and
placed
a
beautiful
crown
on
her
head
after
he
had
done
this
he
withdrew
through
the
said
opening
by
the
same
means
and
thus
appeared
as
if
he
were
returning
to
the
skies
of
his
own
accord
before
the
grand
chastelet
there
was
a
splendid
court
adorned
with
azure
tapestry
which
was
intended
to
be
a
representation
of
the
and
it
was
very
large
and
richly
decorated
in
the
middle
of
it
was
a
very
large
pure
white
artificial
stag
its
horns
gilt
and
its
neck
encircled
with
a
crown
of
gold
it
was
so
ingeniously
constructed
that
its
eyes
horns
mouth
and
all
its
limbs
were
put
in
motion
by
a
man
who
was
secreted
within
its

were
the

that
is
to
say
three

on
an
azure
shield
near
the
stag
there
was
a
large
sword
beautiful
and
bright
unsheathed
and
when
the
queen
passed
the
stag
was
made
to
take
the
sword
in
the
right
to
hold
it
out
straight
and
to
brandish
it
it
was
reported
to
the
king
that
the
said
preparations
were
made
and
he
said
to
savoisy
who
was
one
of
those
nearest
to
him
i
earnestly
entreat
thee
to
mount
a
good
horse
and
i
will
ride
behind
thee
and
we
will
so
dress
ourselves
that
no
one
will
know
us
and
let
us
go
and
see
the
entry
of
my
wife
and
although
savoisy
did
all
he
could
to
dissuade
him
the
king
insisted
and
ordered
that
it
should
be
done
so
savoisy
did
what
the
king
had
ordered
and
disguised
himself
as
well
as
he
could
and
mounted
on
a
powerful
horse
with
the
king
behind
him
they
went
through
the
town
and
managed
so
as
to
reach
the
chastelet
at
the
time
the
queen
was
passing
there
was
a
great
crowd
and
savoisy
placed
himself
as
near
as
he
could
and
there
were
sergeants
on
all
sides
with
thick
birch
wands
who
in
order
to
prevent
the
crowd
from
pressing
upon
and
injuring
the
court
where
the
stag
was
hit
away
with
their
wands
as

continually
to
get
nearer
and
nearer
and
the
sergeants
who
neither
knew
the

nor
savoisy
struck
away
at
them

the
king
received
several
very
hard
and
blows
on
the
shoulders
in
the
evening
in
the
presence
of
the
ladies
the
matter
was
talked
over
and
they
began
to
joke
about
it
and
even
the
king
himself
laughed
at
the
blows
he
had
received
the
queen

her
entry
was
seated
on
a
litter
and
very
magnificently
dressed
as
were
also
the
ladies
and
maids
of
honour
it
was
indeed
a
splendid
sight
and
if
any
one
wished
to
describe
the
dresses
of
the
ladies
of
the
knights
and
squires
and
of
those
who
escorted
the
queen
it
would
take
a
long
time
to

commenced

no

duty
it
was
to
determine

should
be
tried
on

criminal

to
deliberate
on
any
political

any
edict
of
importance
we
know
the
prominent
and
we
may
say
even
the
fatal
part
played
by
these
solemnities
which
were
being
continually
and
on
every
sort
of
pretext
during
the
latter
days
of
monarchy
these
courts
were
always
held
with
impressive
pomp

usually
summoned

the
princes
of
the
blood
royal
and
the
officers
of

occupied

and

ushers
of

court
were
in
a
kneeling
posture
having
thus
mentioned
the
assemblies
of
persons
of
distinction
the
interviews
of
sovereigns

and
the
reception
of
ambassadors
without
describing
them
in
detail
which
would
involve
more
space
than
we
have
at
our
command
we
will
enter
upon
the
subject
of
the
special
ceremonial
adopted
by
the
nobility
taking
as
our
guide
the
standard
book
called
honneurs
de
la
cour
compiled
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
by
the
celebrated
aliénor
de
poitiers
in
addition
to
her
own
observations
she
gives
those
of
her
mother
isabelle
de
souza
who
herself
had
but
continued
the
work
of
another
noble
lady
jeanne
married
in
to
the
count
william
de
namur
who
was
considered
the
best
authority
to
be
found
in
the
kingdom
of
france
this
collection
of
the
customs
of
the
court
forms
a
kind
of
family
diary
embracing
three
generations
and
extending
back
over
more
than
a
century
notwithstanding
the
curious
and
interesting
character
of
this
book
and
the
authority
which
it
possesses
on
this
subject
we
can
not
much
to
our
regret
do
more
than
borrow
a
few
passages
from
it
but
these
carefully
selected
will
no
doubt
suffice
to
give
some
idea
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
nobility
during
the
fifteenth
century
and
to
illustrate
the
laws
of
etiquette
of
which
it
was
the
recognised
code
one
of
the
early
chapters
of
the
work
sets
forth
this
fundamental
law
of
french
ceremonial
namely
that
according
to
the
traditions
or
customs
of
france
women
however
exalted
their
position
be
they
even
daughters
rank
with
their
husbands
we
find
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
king
charles
vii
with
mary
of
anjou
in
although
probably
there
had
never
been
assembled
together
so
many
princes
and
ladies
of
rank
that
at
the
banquet
the
ladies
alone
dined
with
the
queen
and
no
gentlemen
sat
with
them
we
may
remark
whilst
on
this
subject
that
before
the
reign
of
francis
it
was
not
customary
for
the
two
sexes
to
be
associated
together
in
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
court
life
and
we
have
elsewhere
remarked
see
chapter
on
private
life
that
this
departure
from
ancient
custom
exerted
a
considerable
influence
not
only
on
manners
but
also
on
public
affairs

the
authoress
of
the
honneurs
de

specially
mentions
the
respect
which
queen
mary
of
anjou
paid
to
the
duchess
of
burgundy
when
she
was
at
châlons
in
champagne
in
the
duchess
came
with
all
her
retinue
on
horseback
and
in
carriages
into
the
courtyard
of
the
mansion
where
the
king
and
queen
were
and
there
alighted
her
first
maid
of
honour
acting
as
her
de
bourbon
gave
her
his
right
hand
and
the
gentlemen
went
on
in
front
in
this
manner
she
was
conducted
to
the
hall
which
served
as
the
to
the
queen
apartment
there
she
stopped
and
sent
in
de
crequi
to
ask
the
queen
if
it
was
her
pleasure
that
she
should
enter
when
the
duchess
came
to
the
door
she
took
the
train
of
her
dress
from
the
lady
who
bore
it
and
let
it
trail
on
the
ground
and
as
she
entered
she
knelt
and
then
adyanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
there
she
made
the
same
obeisance
and
moved
straight
towards
the
queen
who
was
standing
close
to
the
foot
of
her
throne
when
the
duchess
had
performed
a
further
act
of
homage
the
queen
advanced
two
or
three
steps
and
the
duchess
fell
on
her
knees
the
queen
then
put
her
hand
on
her
shoulder
embraced
her
kissed
her
and
commanded
her
to
rise
the
duchess
then
went
up
to
margaret
of
scotland
wife
of
the
dauphin
afterwards
louis
who
was
four
or
five
feet
from
the
queen
and
paid
her
the
same
honours
as
she
had
done
to
the
queen
although
the
dauphine
appeared
to
wish
to
prevent
her
from
absolutely
kneeling
to
her
after
this
she
turned
towards
the
queen
of
sicily
isabelle
de
lorraine
wife
of
rené
of
anjou
of
the
king
who
was
two
or
three
feet
from
the
dauphine
and
merely
bowed
to
her
and
the
same
to
another
princess
madame
de
calabre
who
was
still
more
distantly
connected
with
the
blood
royal
then
the
queen
and
after
her
the
dauphine
kissed
the
three
maids
of
honour
of
the
duchess
and
the
wives
of
the
gentlemen
the
duchess
did
the
same
to
the
ladies
who
accompanied
the
queen
and
the
dauphine
but
of
those
of
the
queen
of
sicily
the
duchess
kissed
none
inasmuch
as
the
queen
had
not
kissed
hers
and
the
duchess
would
not
walk
behind
the
queen
for
she
said
that
the
duke
of
burgundy
was
nearer
the
crown
of
france
than
was
the
king
of
sicily
and
also
that
she
was
daughter
of
the
king
of
portugal
who
was
greater
than
the
king
of
sicily
further
on
from
the
details
given
of
a
similar
reception
we
learn
that
etiquette
was
not
at
that
time
regulated
by
the
laws
of
politeness
as
now
understood
inasmuch
as
the
voluntary
respect
paid
by
men
to
the
gentle
sex
was
influenced
much
by
social
rank
thus
at
the
time
of
a
visit
of
louis
then
dauphin
to
the
court
of
brussels
to
which
place
he
went
to
seek
refuge
against
the
anger
of
his
father
the
duchesses
of
burgundy
of
charolais
and
of
clèves
his
near
relatives
exhibited
towards
him
all
the
tokens
of
submission
and
inferiority
which
he
might
have
received
from
a
vassal
the
dauphin
it
is
true
wished
to
avoid
this
homage
and
a
disussion
on
the
subject
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ensued
at
last
he
took
the
duchess
of
burgundy
by
the
arm
and
led
her
away
in
order
to
cut
short
the
ceremonies
about
which
madame
made
so
much
to
do
this
however
did
not
prevent
the
princesses
on
their
withdrawing
from
kneeling
to
the
ground
in
order
to
show
their
respect
for
the
son
of
the
king
of
france

of
louis
xi
into

a
miniature
in

manuscript
of
the
fifteenth
century
imperial
library
of
paris
we
have
already
seen
that
the
duchess
of
burgundy
when
about
to
appear
before
the
queen
took
her
train
from
her
in
order
that
she
might
carry
it
herself
in
this
she
was
only
conforming
to
a
general
principle
which
was
that
in
the
presence
of
a
superior
a
person
however
high
his
rank
should
not
himself
receive
honours
whilst
at
the
same
time
paying
them
to
another
thus
a
duke
and
a
duchess
amidst
their
court
had
all
the
things
which
were
used
at
their
table
covered
hence
the
modern
expression
le
to
lay
the
cloth
even
the
basin
and
the
a
kind
of
case
in
which
the
cups
knives
and
other
table
articles
were
kept
but
when
they
were
entertaining
a
king
all
these
marks
of
superiority
were
removed
as
a
matter
of
etiquette
from
the
table
at
which
they
sat
and
were
passed
on
as
an
act
of
respect
to
the
sovereign
present
the
book
of
dame
aliénor
in
a
series
of
articles
to
which
we
shall
merely
allude
speaks
at
great
length
and
enters
into
detail
respecting
the
interior
arrangements
of
the
rooms
in
which
princes
and
other
noble
children
were
born
the
formalities
gone
through
on
these
occasions
were
as
curious
as
they
were
complicated
and
dame
aliénor
regretted
to
see
them
falling
into
disuse
owing
to
which
she
says
we
fear
that
the
possessions
of
the
great
houses
of
the
nobility
are
getting
too
large
as
every
one
admits
and
chicanery
or
concealment
of
birth
so
as
to
make
away
with
too
many
children
is
on
the
increase
mourning
is
the
next
subject
which
we
shall
notice
the
king
never
wore
black
for
mourning
not
even
for
his
father
but
scarlet
or
violet
the
queen
wore
white
and
did
not
leave
her
apartments
for
a
whole
year
hence
the
name
of
hôtel
or
de
la
reine
which
many
of
the
buildings
of
the
middle
ages
still
bear
from
the
fact
that
widowed
queens
inhabited
them
during
the
first
year
of
their
widowhood
on
occasions
of
mourning
the
various
reception
rooms
of
a
house
were
hung
with
black
in
deep
mourning
such
as
that
for
a
husband
or
a
father
a
lady
wore
neither
gloves
jewels
nor
silk
the
head
was
covered
with
a
low
black
with
trailing
lappets
called
barbettes
and
a
duchess
and
the
wife
of
a
knight
or
a
banneret
on
going
into
mourning
stayed
in
their
apartments
for
six
weeks
the
former
during
the
whole
of
this
time
when
in
deep
mourning
remained
lying
down
all
day
on
a
bed
covered
with
a
white
sheet
whereas
the
latter
at
the
end
of
nine
days
got
up
and
until
the
six
weeks
were
over
remained
sitting
in
front
of
the
bed
on
a
black
sheet
ladies
did
not
attend
the
funerals
of
their
husbands
though
it
was
usual
for
them
to
be
present
at
those
of
their
fathers
and
mothers
for
an
elder
brother
they
wore
the
same
mourning
as
for
a
father
but
they
did
not
lie
down
as
above
described

says

in
conclusion
are
the
points
of
etiquette
which
are
observed
in
germany
in
france
in
naples
in
italy
and
in
all
other
civilised
countries
and
kingdoms
we
may
here
remark
that
etiquette
after
having
originated
in
france
spread
throughout
all
christian
nations
and
when
it
had
become
naturalised
as
it
were
amongst
the
latter
it
acquired
a
settled
position
which
it
retained
more
firmly
than
it
did
in
france
in
this
latter
country
it
was
only
from
the
seventeenth
century
and
particularly
under
louis
that
court
etiquette
really
became
a
science
and
almost
a
species
of
religions
observance
whose
minutiae
were
attended
to
as
much
as
if
they
were
sacramental
rites
though
they
were
not
unfrequently
of
the
most
childish
character
and
whose
pomp
and
precision
often
caused
the
most
insufferable
annoyance
but
notwithstanding
the
perpetual
changes
of
times
and
customs
the
french
nation
has
always
been
distinguished
for
nobility
and
dignity
tempered
with
good
sense
and
elegance
if
we
now
direct
our
attention
to
the
that
class
which
to
quote
a
celebrated
expression
was
destined
to
become
everything
after
having
for
a
long
time
been
looked
upon
as
nothing
we
shall
notice
that
there
too
custom
and
tradition
had
much
to
do
with
ceremonies
of
all
kinds
the
presence
of
the
middle
classes
not
only
gave
as
it
were
a
stamp
of
grandeur
to
fêtes
of
an
aristocratic
and
religions
character
but
in
addition
the
people
themselves
had
a
number
of
ceremonies
of
every
description
in
which
etiquette
was
not
one
whit
less
strict
than
in
those
of
the
court
the
variety
of
civic
and
popular
ceremonies
is
so
great
that
it
would
require
a
large
volume
illustrated
with
numerous
engravings
to
explain
fully
their
characteristic
features
the
simple
enumeration
of
the
various
public
fêtes
each
of
which
was
necessarily
accompanied
by
a
distinct
ceremonial
would
take
up
much
time
were
we
to
attempt
to
give
it
even
in
the
shortest
manner

which
were
purely
religious
namely

the
of
the
of
the
of
the
of
then
there
were
the
historical
or
commemorative
fêtes
such
as
those
of
the

of
the

also
of
de

in

the
processions
of
at

of

and
lastly
the
numerous

of

the

corporation
and
lastly
the
called
also
ducasses
folies
foires
kermesses
from
this
simple
enumeration
it
can
easily
be
understood
what
a
useless
task
we
should
impose
upon
ourselves
were
we
merely
to
enter
upon
so
wide
and
difficult
a
subject
apart
from
the
infinite
variety
of
details
resulting
from
the
local
circumstances
under
which
these
ceremonies
had
been
instituted
which
were
everywhere
celebrated
at
fixed
periods
a
kind
of
general
principle
regulated
and
directed
their
arrangement
nearly
all
these
fêtes
and
public
rejoicings
which
to
a
certain
extent
constituted
the
common
basis
of
popular
ceremonial
bore
much
analogy
to
one
another
there
are
however
certain
peculiarities
less
known
and
more
striking
than
the
rest
which
deserve
to
be
mentioned
and
we
shall
then
conclude
this
part
of
our
subject

those
rites
ceremonies
and
customs
which
are
the
most
commonly
observed
and
which
most
persistently
keep
their
place
amongst
us
are
far
from
being
of
modern
origin
thus
the
custom
of
jovially
celebrating
the
commencement
of
the
new
year
or
of
devoting
certain
particular
days
to
festivity
is
still
universally
followed
in
every
country
in
the
world
the
practice
of
sending
presents
on
year
is
to
be
found
among
civilised
nations
in
the
east
as
well
as
in
our
own
country
in
the
middle
ages
the
intimate
friends
of
princes
and
especially
of
the
kings
of
france
received
christmas
gifts
for
which
they
considered
themselves
bound
to
make
an
ample
return
in
england
these
interchanges
of
generosity
also
take
place
on
christmas
day
in
russia
on
easter
day
the
people
on
meeting
in
the
street
salute
one
another
by
saying
christ
is
risen
these
practices
as
well
as
many
others
have
no
doubt
been
handed
down
to
us
from
the
early
ages
of
christianity
the
same
may
be
said
of
a
vast
number
of
customs
of
a
more
or
less
local
character
which
have
been
observed
in
various
countries
for
centuries
in
former
times
at
ochsenbach
in
wurtemberg
during
the
carnival
women
held
a
feast
at
which
they
were
waited
upon
by
men
and
after
it
was
over
they
formed
themselves
into
a
sort
of
court
of
plenary
indulgence
from
which
the
men
were
uniformly
excluded
and
sat
in
judgment
on
one
another
at
ramerupt
a
small
town
in
champagne
every
year
on
the
of
may
twenty
of
the
citizens
repaired
to
the
adjoining
hamlet
of
remy
hunting
as
they
went
along
they
were
called
fools
of
and
it
was
said
that
the
greatest
fool
led
the
band
the
inhabitants
of
remy
were
bound
to
receive
them
gratuitously
and
to
supply
them
as
well
as
their
horses
and
dogs
with
what
they
required
to
have
a
mass
said
for
them
to
put
up
with
all
the
absurd
vagaries
of
the
captain
and
his
troop
and
to
supply
them
with
a
and
handsome
horned
ram
which
was
led
back
in
triumph
on
their
return
into
ramerupt
they
set
up
shouts
at
the
door
of
the
curé
the
procurator
fiscal
and
the
collector
of
taxes
and
after
the
invention
of
gunpowder
fireworks
were
let
off
they
then
went
to
the
where
they
danced
round
the
ram
which
was
decorated
with
ribbons
no
doubt
this
was
a
relic
of
the
feasts
of
ancient
heathenism
a
more
curious
ceremony
still
whose
origin
we
think
may
be
traced
to
the
dionysian
feasts
of
heathenism
has
continued
to
be
observed
to
this
day
at
béziers
it
bears
the
names
of
the
of
the
of
béziers
or
the
of
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
rue
française
at
béziers
a
statue
is
to
be
seen
which
notwithstanding
the
mutilations
to
which
it
has
been
subjected
still
distinctly
bears
traces
of
being
an
ancient
work
of
the
most
refined
period
of
art
this
statue
represents
pepézuch
a
citizen
of
béziers
who
according
to
somewhat
questionable
tradition
valiantly
defended
the
town
against
the
goths
or
as
some
say
against
the
english
its
origin
therefore
can
not
be
later
than
the
thirteenth
century
on
ascension
day
the
day
of
the
feast
of
pepézuch
an
immense
procession
went
about
the
town
three
remarkable
machines
were
particularly
noticeable
the
first
was
an
enormous
wooden
camel
made
to
walk
by
mechanism
and
to
move
its
limbs
and
jaws
the
second
was
a
galley
on
wheels
fully
manned
the
third
consisted
of
a
cart
on
which
a
travelling
theatre
was
erected
the
consuls
and
other
civic
authorities
the
corporations
of
trades
having
the
pastors
walking
in
front
of
them
the
farriers
on
horseback
all
bearing
their
respective
insignia
and
banners
formed
the
procession
a
double
column
composed
of
a
division
of
young
men
and
young
women
holding
white
hoops
decorated
with
ribbons
and
streamers
was
preceded
by
a
young
girl
crowned
with
flowers
half
veiled
and
carrying
a
basket
this
brilliant
procession
marched
to
the
sound
of
music
and
at
certain
distances
the
youthful
couples
of
the
two
sexes
halted
in
order
to
perform
with
the
assistance
of
their
hoops
various
figures
which
were
called
the
des
the
machines
also
stopped
from
time
to
time
at
various
places
the
camel
was
especially
made
to
enter
the
church
of
aphrodise
because
it
was
said
that
the
apostle
had
first
come
on
a
camel
to
preach
the
gospel
in
that
country
and
there
to
receive
the
palm
of
martyrdom
on
arriving
before
the
statue
of
pepézuch
the
young
people
decorated
it
with
garlands
when
the
square
of
the
town
was
reached
the
theatre
was
stopped
like
the
ancient
car
of
thespis
and
the
actors
treated
the
people
to
a
few
comical
drolleries
in
imitation
of
aristophanes
from
the
galley
the
youths
flung
and
sweetmeats
which
the
spectators
returned
in
equal
profusion
the
procession
closed
with
a
number
of
men
crowned
with
green
leaves
carrying
on
their
heads
loaves
of
bread
which
with
other
provisions
contained
in
the
galley
were
distributed
amongst
the
poor
of
the
town
in
germany
and
in
france
it
was
the
custom
at
the
public
entries
of
kings
princes
and
persons
of
rank
to
offer
them
the
wines
made
in
the
district
and
commonly
sold
in
the
town
at
langres
for
instance
these
wines
were
put
into
four
pewter
vessels
called
which
are
still
to
be
seen
they
were
called
the
monkey
and
wines
symbolical
names
which
expressed
the
different
degrees
or
phases
of
drunkenness
which
they
were
supposed
to
be
capable
of
producing
the
lion
courage
the
monkey
cunning
the
sheep
good
temper
the
pig
bestiality
we
will
now
conclude
by
borrowing
from
the
excellent
work
of
alfred
michiels
on
dutch
and
flemish
painting
the
abridged
description
of
a
procession
of
corporations
of
trades
which
took
place
at
antwerp
in
on
the
sunday
after
ascension
day
all
the
corporations
of
trades
were
present
every
member
being
dressed
in
his
best
suit
in
front
of
each
guild
a
banner
floated
and
immediately
behind
an
enormous
lighted
was
carried

music
was
played
on
long
silver
trumpets

and
drums
the
goldsmiths

masons
silk
embroiderers
sculptors
carpenters
boatmen
fishermen
butchers
curriers
drapers
bakers
tailors
and
men
of
every
other
trade
marched
two
abreast
then
came
crossbowmen
arquebusiers
archers
some
on
foot
and
some
on
horseback
after
them
came
the
various
monastic
orders
and
then
followed
a
crowd
of
bourgeois
magnificently
dressed
a
numerous
company
of
widows
dressed
in
white
from
head
to
foot
particularly
attracted
attention
they
constituted
a
sort
of
sisterhood
observing
certain
rules
and
gaining
their
livelihood
by
various
descriptions
of
manual
work
the
cathedral
canons
and
the
other
priests
walked
in
the
procession
in
their
gorgeous
silk
vestments
sparkling
with
gold
twenty
persons
carried
on
their
shoulders
a
huge
figure
of
the
virgin
with
the
infant
saviour
in
her
arms
splendidly
decorated
at
the
end
of
the
procession
were
chariots
and
ships
on
wheels
there
were
various
groups
in
the
procession
representing
scenes
from
the
old
and
new
testament
such
as
the
of
the
the
of
the
who
appeared
riding
on
camels

other
historical
incidents

adopted

of
the
people

they
considered

an
improvement
on

own
although
the
original
style
of
dress
was

little
altered

consisted
of

known
under
the
various
names
of

but
notwithstanding
these
several
appellations
there
was
scarcely
any
appreciable
distinction
between
them
the
simple
tunic
with
sleeves
which
answered
to
our
shirt
was
like
the
modern
blouse
in
shape
and
was
called
by
various
names

usually
short

invented
by
female
ingenuity
as
well
as
of
other
articles
of
dress
which
formed
elegant
accessories

there
was
no
essential
alteration
in
the
national
costume
nor
was
there
any
change
in
the
shape
of
the
numerous
descriptions
of

the
barbarian
invasions
brought
about
a
revolution
in
the
dress
as
well
as
in
the
social
state
of
the
people
and
it
is
from
the
time
of
these
invasions
that
we
may
date
properly
speaking
the
history
of
modern
dress
for
the
roman
costume
which
was
in
use
at
the
same
time
as
that
of
the
franks
the
huns
the
vandals
the
goths
was
subjected
to
various
changes
down
to
the
ninth
century
these
modifications
increased
afterwards
to
such
an
extent
that
towards
the
fourteenth
century
the
original
type
had
altogether
disappeared
illustration
figs
and
from
discovered
in
paris
in
underneath
the
choir
of
it
was
quite
natural
that
men
living
in
a
temperate
climate
and
bearing
arms
only
when
in
the
service
of
the
state
should
be
satisfied
with
garments
which
they
could
wear
without
wrapping
themselves
up
too
closely
the
northern
nations
on
the
contrary
had
early
learned
to
protect
themselves
against
the
severity
of
the
climate
in
which
they
lived
thus
the
garments
known
by
them
as
and
by
the
parthians
as
doubtless
gave
origin
to
those
which
have
been
respectively
called
by
us
trousses
grègues
culottes
these
wandering
people
had
other
reasons
for
preferring
the
short
and
garments
to
those
which
were
long
and
full
and
these
were
their
innate
pugnacity
which
forced
them
ever
to
be
under
arms
their
habit
of
dwelling
in
forests
and
thickets
their
love
of
the
chase
and
their
custom
of
wearing
armour
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
always
went
bareheaded
in
the
towns
but
in
the
country
in
order
to
protect
themselves
from
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
they
wore
hats
much
resembling
our
round
hats
made
of
felt
plaited
rushes
or
straw
other
european
nations
of
the
same
period
also
went
bareheaded
or
wore
caps
made
of
skins
of
animals
having
no
regularity
of
style
and
with
the
shape
of
which
we
are
but
little
acquainted
shoes
and
of
a
definite
style
belong
to
a
much
more
modern
period
as
also
do
the
many
varieties
of
female
dress
which
have
been
known
at
all
times
and
in
all
countries
under
the
general
name
of
the
girdle
was
only
used
occasionally
and
its
adoption
depended
on
circumstances
the
women
used
it
in
the
same
way
as
the
men
for
in
those
days
it
was
never
attached
to
the
dress
the
great
difference
in
modern
female
costume
consists
in
the
fact
of
the
girdle
being
part
of
the
dress
thus
giving
a
long
or
short
waist
according
to
the
requirements
of
fashion
in
the
same
manner
a
complete
revolution
took
place
in
dress
according
as
loose
or
tight
long
or
short
sleeves
were
introduced
we
shall
commence
our
historical
sketch
from
the
fifth
century
at
which
period
we
can
trace
the
blending
of
the
roman
with
the
barbaric
costume
namely
the
combination
of
the
long
shapeless
garment
with
that
which
was
worn
by
the
germans
and
which
was
accompanied
by
braies
thus
in
the
recumbent
statue
which
adorned
the
tomb
of
clovis
in
the
church
of
the
abbey
of
geneviève
the
king
is
represented
as
wearing
the
and
the
but
in
addition
civilization
had
actually
given
him
braies
somewhat
similar
to
what
we
now
call
pantaloons
besides
this
his
tunic
is
fastened
by
a
belt
which
however
was
not
a
novelty
in
his
time
for
the
women
then
wore
long
dresses
fastened
at
the
waist
by
a
girdle
there
is
nothing
very
remarkable
about
his
shoes
since
we
find
that
the
shoe
or
closed
sandal
was
worn
from
the
remotest
periods
by
nearly
all
nations

the

claims
an
equally
ancient
origin
the
principal
thing
worthy
of
notice
is
the
amount
of
ornament
with
which
the
franks
enriched
their
girdles
and
the
borders
of
their
tunics
and
cloaks
this
fashion
they
borrowed
from
the
imperial
court
which
having
been
transferred
from
rome
to
constantinople
during
the
third
century
was
not
slow
to
adopt
the
luxury
of
precious
stones
and
other
rich
decorations
commonly
in
use
amongst
eastern
nations
following
the
example
of
horace
de
vielcastel
the
learned
author
of
a
history
of
the
costumes
of
france
we
may
here
state
that
it
is
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
define
the
exact
costume
during
the
time
of
the
early
merovingian
periods
the
first
writers
who
have
touched
upon
this
subject
have
spoken
of
it
very
vaguely
or
not
being
contemporaries
of
the
times
of
which
they
wrote
could
only
describe
from
tradition
or
hearsay
those
monuments
in
which
early
costume
is
supposed
to
be
represented
are
almost
all
of
later
date
when
artists
whether
sculptors
or
painters
were
not
very
exact
in
their
delineations
of
costume
and
even
seemed
to
imagine
that
no
other
style
could
have
existed
before
their
time
than
the
one
with
which
they
were
daily
familiar
in
order
to
be
as
accurate
as
possible
although
after
all
we
can
only
speak
hypothetically
we
can
not
do
better
than
call
to
mind
on
the
one
hand
what
tacitus
says
of
the
germans
that
they
were
almost
naked
excepting
for
a
short
and
tight
garment
round
their
waists
and
a
little
square
cloak
which
they
threw
over
the
right
shoulder
and
on
the
other
to
carry
ourselves
back
in
imagination
to
the
ancient
roman
costume
we
may
notice
moreover
the
curious
description
given
of
the
franks
by
sidoine
apollinaire
who
says
they
tied
up
their
flaxen
or
hair
above
their
foreheads
into
a
kind
of
tuft
and
then
made
it
fall
behind
the
head
like
a
horse
tail
the
face
was
clean
shaved
with
the
exception
of
two
long
moustaches
they
wore
cloth
garments
fitting
tight
to
the
body
and
limbs
and
a
broad
belt
to
which
they
hung
their
swords
but
this
is
a
sketch
made
at
a
time
when
the
frankish
race
was
only
known
among
the
gauls
through
its
marauding
tribes
whose
raids
from
time
to
time
spread
terror
and
dismay
throughout
the
countries
which
they
visited
from
the
moment
when
the
uncultivated
tribes
of
ancient
germany
formally
took
possession
of
the
territory
which
they
had
withdrawn
from
roman
rule
they
showed
themselves
desirous
of
adopting
the
more
gentle
manners
of
the
conquered
nation
in
imitation
of
their
chief
says
jules
quicherat
the
eminent
antiquarian
more
than
once
the
franks
doffed
the
war
coat
and
the
leather
belt
and
assumed
the
toga
of
roman
dignity
more
than
once
their
flaxen
hair
was
shown
to
advantage
by
flowing
over
the
imperial
mantle
and
the
gold
of
the
knights
the
purple
of
the
senators
and
patricians
the
triumphal
crowns
the
fasces
and
in
short
everything
which
the
roman
empire
invented
in
order
to
exhibit
its
grandeur
assisted
in
adding
to
that
of
our
ancestors

to

brussels
designs
by
count
de
vielcastel
one
great
and
characteristic
difference
between
the
romans
and
the
franks
should
however
be
specially
mentioned
namely
in
the
fashion
of
wearing
the
hair
long
a
fashion
never
adopted
by
the
romans
and
which
during
the
whole
of
the
first
dynasty
was
a
distinguishing
mark
of
kings
and
nobles
among
the
franks
agathias
the
greek
historian
says
the
hair
is
never
cut
from
the
heads
of
the
frankish
kings
sons
from
early
youth
their
hair
falls
gracefully
over
their
shoulders
it
is
parted
on
the
forehead
and
falls
equally
on
both
sides
it
is
with
them
a
matter
to
which
they
give
special
attention
we
are
told
besides
that
they
sprinkled
it
with
and
plaited
it
in
small
bands
which
they
ornamented
with
pearls
and
precious
metals
whilst
persons
of
rank
were
distinguished
by
their
long
and
flowing
hair
the
people
wore
theirs
more
or
less
short
according
to
the
degree
of
freedom
which
they
possessed
and
the
serfs
had
their
heads
completely
shaved
it
was
customary
for
the
noble
and
free
classes
to
swear
by
their
hair
and
it
was
considered
the
height
of
politeness
to
pull
out
a
hair
and
present
it
to
a
person
frédégaire
the
chronicler
relates
that
clovis
thus
pulled
out
a
hair
in
order
to
do
honour
to
germer
bishop
of
toulouse
and
presented
it
to
him
upon
this
the
courtiers
hastened
to
imitate
their
sovereign
and
the
venerable
prelate
returned
home
with
his
hand
full
of
hair
delighted
at
the
flattering
reception
he
had
met
with
at
the
court
of
the
frankish
king
durinig
the
merovingian
period
the
greatest
insult
that
could
be
offered
to
a
freeman
was
to
touch
him
with
a
razor
or
scissors
the
degradation
of
kings
and
princes
was
carried
out
in
a
public
manner
by
shaving
their
heads
and
sending
them
into
a
monastery
on
their
regaining
their
rights
and
their
authority
their
hair
was
always
allowed
to
grow
again
we
may
also
conclude
that
great
importance
was
attached
to
the
preservation
of
the
hair
even
under
the
kings
of
the
second
dynasty
for
charlemagne
in
his
capitulaires
orders
the
hair
to
be
removed
as
a
punishment
in
certain
crimes
the
franks
faithful
to
their
ancient
custom
of
wearing
the
hair
long
gradually
gave
up
shaving
the
face
at
first
they
only
left
a
small
tuft
on
the
chin
but
by
degrees
they
allowed
this
to
increase
and
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
freemen
adopted
the
usual
form
of
beard
amongst
the
clergy
the
custom
prevailed
of
shaving
the
crown
of
the
head
in
the
same
way
as
that
adopted
by
certain
monastic
orders
in
the
present
day
priests
for
a
long
time
wore
beards
but
ceased
to
do
so
on
their
becoming
fashionable
amongst
the
laity
figs
painters
and
sculptors
therefore
commit
a
serious
error
in
representing
the
prelates
and
monks
of
those
times
with
large
beards
as
far
as
the
monumental
relics
of
those
remote
times
allow
us
to
judge
the
dress
as
worn
by
clovis
underwent
but
trifing
modifications
during
the
first
dvnasty
but
during
the
reigns
of
pepin
and
charlemagne
considerable
changes
were
effected
which
resulted
from
the
intercourse
either
of
a
friendly
or
hostile
nature
between
the
franks
and
the
southern
nations
about
this
time
silk
stuffs
were
introduced
into
the
kingdom
and
the
upper
classes
in
order
to
distinguish
themselves
from
the
lower
had
their
garments
trimmed
round
with
costly
furs

we
have
before
stated
see
chapter
on
private
life
that
charlemagne
who
always
was
very
simple
in
his
tastes
strenuously
set
his
face
against
these
novel
introductions
of
luxury
which
he
looked
upon
as
tending
to
do
harm
of
what
use
are
these
cloaks
he
said
in
bed
they
can
not
cover
us
on
horseback
they
can
neither
protect
us
from
the
rain
nor
the
wind
and
when
we
are
sitting
they
can
neither
preserve
our
legs
from
the
cold
nor
the
damp
he
himself
generally
wore
a
large
tunic
made
of
skins
on
one
occasion
his
courtiers
went
out
hunting
with
him
clothed
in
splendid
garments
of
southern
fashion
which
became
much
torn
by
the
briars
and
begrimed
with
the
blood
of
the
animals
they
had
killed
oh
ye
foolish
men
he
said
to
them
the
next
day
as
he
showed
them
his
own
tunic
which
a
servant
had
just
returned
to
him
in
perfect
condition
after
having
simply
dried
it
before
the
fire
and
rubbed
it
with
his
hands
whose
garments
are
the
more
valuable
and
the
more
useful
mine
for
which
i
have
only
paid
a
sou
about
francs
of
present
money
or
yours
which
have
cost
so
much
from
that
time
whenever
this
great
king
entered
on
a
campaign
the
officers
of
his
household
even
the
most
rich
and
powerful
did
not
dare
to
show
themselves
in
any
clothes
but
those
made
of
leather
wool
or
cloth
for
had
they
on
such
occasions
made
their
appearance
dressed
in
silk
and
ornaments
he
would
have
sharply
reproved
them
and
have
treated
them
as
cowards
or
as
effeminate
and
consequently
unfit
for
the
work
in
which
he
was
about
to
engage
nevertheless
this
monarch
who
so
severely
proscribed
luxury
in
daily
life
made
the
most
magnificent
display
on
the
occasions
of
political
or
religious
festivals
when
the
imperial
dignity
with
which
he
was
invested
required
to
be
set
forth
by
pompous
ceremonial
and
richness
of
attire
during
the
reign
of
the
other
carlovingian
kings
in
the
midst
of
political
troubles
of
internal
wars
and
of
social
disturbances
they
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
for
inventing
new
fashions
monuments
of
the
latter
part
of
the
ninth
century
prove
indeed
that
the
national
dress
had
hardly
undergone
any
change
since
the
time
of
charlemagne
and
that
the
influence
of
roman
tradition
especially
on
festive
occasions
was
still
felt
in
the
dress
of
the
nobles

surrounded
by
the

of
his

by

all
dressed

the

is

representing
four
women
listening
to
the
discourse
of
a
prophet
from
this
we
discover
that
the
female
costume
of
the
time
consisted
of
two
tunics
the
under
one
being
longer
but
less
capacious
than
the
other
the
sleeves
of
the
former
coming
down
tight

and
being
plaited
in
many
folds
whilst
those

open

reach

the

the

notwithstanding
that
under
the
carlovingian
dynasty
it
was
always
considered
a
shame
and
a
dishonour
to
have
the
head
shaved
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
upper
classes
continued
to
wear
the
long
merovingian
style
of
hair
after
the
reign
of
charlemagne
it
was
the
fashion
to
shave
the
hair
from
above
the
forehead
the
parting
being
thus
widened
and
the
hair
was
so
arranged
that
it
should
not
fall
lower
than
the
middle
of
the
neck
under
charles
the
bald
whose
surname
proves
that
he
was
not
partial
to
long
hair
this
custom
fell
into
disuse
or
was
abandoned
and
men
had
the
greater
part
of
their
heads
shaved
and
only
kept
a
sort
of
cap
of
hair
growing
on
the
top
of
the
head
it
is
at
this
period
that
we
first
find
the
worn
this
kind
of
common
made
from
the
furs
of
animals
or
from
woollen
stuffs
continued
to
be
worn
for
many
centuries
and
indeed
almost
to
the
present
day
it
was
originally
only
a
kind
of
cap
light
and
very
small
but
it
gradually
became
extended
in
size
and
successively
covered
the
ears
the
neck
and
lastly
even
the
shoulders
no
great
change
was
made
in
the
dress
of
the
two
sexes
during
the
tenth
century
nothing
was
more
simple
than
the
of
women
says
jules
quicherat
nothing
was
less
studied
than
their
mode
of
wearing
their
hair
nothing
was
more
simple
and
yet
finer
than
their
linen
the
elegant
appearance
of
their
garments
recalls
that
of
the
greek
and
roman
women
their
dresses
were
at
times
so
tight
as
to
display
all
the
elegance
of
their
form
whilst
at
others
they
were
made
so
high
as
completely
to
cover
the
neck
the
latter
were
called
the
which
has
at
all
times
been
part
of
the
dress
of
french
women
and
which
was
frequently
worn
also
by
men
was
a
long
tunic
reaching
to
the
heels
fastened
in
at
the
waist
and
closed
at
the
wrists
queens
princesses
and
ladies
of
the
nobility
wore
in
addition
a
long
cloak
lined
with
ermine
or
a
tunic
with
or
without
sleeves
often
too
their
dress
consisted
of
two
tunics
and
of
a
veil
or

which
was
thrown
over
the
head
and
fell
down
before
and
behind
thus
entirely
surrounding

we
can
not

that
any
very
decided
change
was
made
in
dress
before
the
end
of
the
eleventh

the
ordinary
dress
made
of
thick
cloths
and
of
coarse
woollen

was
very
strong
and
durable
and
not
easily

and
it
was

still

in

which
adhere
to
old
customs
for

slightly
modified

of

they
began
to
make
great
changes
in
their
manner
of
dressing
themselves
they
more
and
more
discarded
roman
fashions
and
assumed
similar
costumes
to
those

before
proceeding
further
in
our
history
of
mediæval
dress
we
must
forestall
a
remark
which
will
not
fail
to
be
made
by
the
reader
and
this
is
that
we
seem
to
occupy
ourselves
exclusively
with
the
dress
of
kings
queens
and
other
people
of
note
but
we
must
reply
that
though
we
are
able
to
form
tolerably
accurate
notions
relative
to
the
dress
of
the
upper
classes
during
these
remote
periods
we
do
not
possess
any
reliable
information
relative
to
that
of
the
lower
orders
and
that
the
written
documents
as
well
as
the
sculptures
and
paintings
are
almost
useless
on
this
point
nevertheless
we
may
suppose
that
the
dress
of
the
men
in
the
lowest
ranks
of
society
has
always
been
short
and
tight
consisting
of
or
tight
drawers
mostly
made
of
leather
of
tight
tunics
of
or
doublets
and
of
capes
or
cloaks
of
coarse
brown
woollen
the
tunic
was
confined
at
the
waist
by
a
belt
to
which
the
knife
the
purse
and
sometimes
the
working
tools
were
suspended
the
of
the
people
was
generally
a
simple
cap
made
of
thick
coarse
woollen
cloth
or
felt
and
often
of
sheep
skin
during
the
twelfth
century

position
was

the
the
cap
was
made
of
velvet

persons
of
rank
and
of
common
cloth

the
poor

which
was
always
an
appendage
to
the
cap
was
made
of
cloth
with
which
the
cap
might
be
fastened
or
adjusted
on
the
head
the
or
round
cap
dates
from
the
earliest
centuries
and
was
altered
both
in
shape
and
material
according
to
the
various
changes
of
fashion
but
lawyers
of
high
position
continued
to
wear
it
almost
in
its
original
shape
and
it
became
like
a
professional
badge
for
judges
and
advocates
in
the
miniatures
of
that
time
we
find
charles
the
good
count
of
flanders
who
died
in
represented
with
a
cap
with
a
point
at
the
top
to
which
a
long
streamer
is
attached
and
a
peak
turned
up
in
front
a
cap
very
similar

without
the

to

that
good
king
who
according
to
the
testimony
of
his
historians
generally
dressed
with
the
greatest
simplicity
but
who
notwithstanding
his
usual
modesty
and
economy
did
not
hesitate
on
great
occasions
to
submit
to
the
pomp
required
by
the
regal
position
which
he
held
sometimes

the
sire
de

he
went
into

in

a

the
surcoat
was
at
first
a
garment
worn
only
by
females

it
was
soon
adopted
by
both
sexes
it
was
originally
a
large
wrapper
with
sleeves

was
thrown
over
the
upper
part
of
the
robe
hence
its

very
soon
it
was
made

as

strove
hard
at

epoch
of

after
many
changes
of
fashion
and
many
struggles
against
the
ancient
roman
and
german
traditions
modern
national
costume
seems
at
last
to
have
assumed
a
settled
and
normal
character
we
think
it
right
to
recapitulate
somewhat
with
a
view
to
set
forth
the
nature
of
the
various
elements
which
were
at
work
from
time
to
time
in
forming
the
fashions
in
dress
in
order
to
give
more
weight
to
our
remarks
we
will
extract
almost
word
for
word
a
few
pages
from
the
learned
and
excellent
work
which
jules
quicherat
has
published
on
this
subject
towards
the
year
he
says
the
dress
of
a
man
not
of
a
man
as
the
word
was
then
used
which
meant
but
of
one
to
whom
the
exercise
of
human
prerogatives
was
permitted
that
is
to
say
of
an
ecclesiastic
a
bourgeois
or
a
noble
was
composed
of
six
indispensable
portions
the
or
breeches
the
stockings
the
shoes
the
coat
the
surcoat
or
and
the
or
to
these
articles
those
who
wished
to
dress
more
elegantly
added
on
the
body
a
shirt
on
the
shoulders
a
mantle
and
on
the
head

hat

of
drawers
generally
knitted
sometimes
made

woollen
stuff
or
silk
and
sometimes
even
of
undressed
leather
our
ancestors
derived
this
part
of
their
dress
from
the
ancient
gauls
only
the
gallic
braies
came
down
to
the
ankle
whereas
those
of
the
thirteenth
century
only
reached
to
the
calf
they
were
fastened
above
the
hips
by
means
of
a
belt
called
the
by
was
meant
what
we
now
call
long
stockings
or
hose
the
stockings
were
of
the
same
colour
and
material
as
the
braies
and
were
kept
up
by
the
lower
part
of
the
braies
being
pulled
over
them
and
tied
with
a
string
the
shoes
were
made
of
various
kinds
of
leather
the
quality
of
which
depended
on
the
way
in
which
they
were
tanned
and
were
either
of
common
leather
or
of
leather
which
was
similar
to
that
we
know
as
morocco
and
was
called
or
hence
the
derivation
of
the
word
which
has
now
become
shoes
were
generally
made
pointed
this
fashion
of
the
or
polish
points
was
followed
throughout
the
whole
of
europe
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
and
when
first
introduced
the
church
was
so
scandalized
by
it
that
it
was
almost
placed
in
the
catalogue
of
heresies
subsequently
the
taste
respecting
the
exaggerated
length
of
the
points
was
somewhat
modified
but
it
had
become
so
inveterate
that
the
tendency
for
pointed
shoes
returning
to
their
former
absurd
extremes
was
constantly
showing
itself
the
pointed
shoes
became
gradually
longer
during
the
struggles
which
were
carried
on
in
the
reign
of
philippe
le
bel
between
church
and
state
besides
the
shoes
there
were
also
the
thus
named
from
summer
thing
because
being
generally
made
of
velvet
brocade
or
other
costly
material
they
could
only
be
worn
in
dry
weather
the
coat
corresponded
with
the
tunic
of
the
ancients
it
was
a
blouse
with
tight
sleeves
these
sleeves
were
the
only
part
of
it
which
were
exposed
the
rest
being
completely
covered
by
the
surcoats
or
a
name
the
origin
of
which
is
obscure
in
shape
the
surcoat
somewhat
resembled
a
sack
in
which
at
a
later
period
large
slits
were
made
in
the
arms
as
well
as
over
the
hips
and
on
the
chest
through
which
appeared
the
rich
furs
and
satins
with
which
it
was
lined
the
ordinary
material
of
the
surcoat
for
the
rich
was
cloth
either
scarlet
blue
or
reddish
brown
or
two
or
more
of
these
colours
mixed
together
and
for
the
poor
or
fustian
the
nobles
princes
or
barons
when
holding
a
court
wore
surcoats
of
a
colour
to
match
their
arms
which
were
embroidered
upon
them
but
the
lesser
nobles
who
frequented
the
houses
of
the
great
spoke
of
themselves
as
in
the
robes
of
such
and
such
a
noble
because
he
whose
patronage
they
courted
was
obliged
to
provide
them
with
surcoats
and
mantles
these
were
of
their
patron
favourite
colour
and
were
called
the
livery
on
account
of
their
distribution
which
took
place
twice
a
year
the
word
has
remained
in
use
ever
since
but
with
a
different
signification
it
is
however
so
nearly
akin
to
the
original
meaning
that
its
affinity
is
evident

an
interesting
anecdote
relative
to
this
custom
is
to
be
found
in
the
chronicles
of
matthew
paris
when
louis
to
the
dismay
of
all
his
vassals
and
of
his
inferior
servants
had
decided
to
take
up
the
cross
he
succeeded
in
associating
the
nobles
of
his
court
with
him
in
his
vow
by
a
kind
of
pious
fraud
having
had
a
certain
number
of
mantles
prepared
for
he
had
a
small
white
cross
embroidered
on
each
above
the
right
shoulder
and
ordered
them
to
be
distributed
among
the
nobles
on
the
morning
of
the
feast
when
they
were
about
to
go
to
mass
which
was
celebrated
some
time
before
sunrise
each
courtier
received
the
mantle
given
by
the
king
at
the
door
of
his
room
and
put
it
on
in
the
dark
without
noticing
the
white
cross
but
when
the
day
broke
to
his
great
surprise
he
saw
the
emblem
worn
by
his
neighbour
without
knowing
that
he
himself
wore
it
also
they
were
surprised
and
amused
says
the
english
historian
at
finding
that
the
king
had
thus
piously
entrapped
them
as
it
would
have
been
unbecoming
shameful
and
even
unworthy
of
them
to
have
removed
these
crosses
they
laughed
heartily
and
said
that
the
good
king
on
starting
as
a
had
found
a
new
method
of
catching
men
the
chaperon
adds
quicherat
was
the
national
of
the
ancient
french
as
the
which
was
its
model
was
that
of
the
gauls
we
can
imagine
its
appearance
by
its
resemblance
to
the
domino
now
worn
at
masked
balls
the
shape
was
much
varied
during
the
reign
of
philippe
le
bel
either
by
the
diminution
of
the
cape
or
by
the
lengthening
of
the
hood
which
was
always
sufficiently
long
to
fall
on
the
shoulders
in
the
first
of
these
changes
the
chaperon
no
longer
being
tied
round
the
neck
required
to
be
held
on
the
head
by
something
more
solid
for
this
reason
it
was
set
on
a
pad
or
roll
which
changed
it
into
a
regular
cap
the
material
was
so
stitched
as
to
make
it
take
certain
folds
which
were
arranged
as
puffs
as
ruffs
or
in
the
shape
of
a
comb

last
fashion
called
was
especially
in
vogue

origin
of
the

not

almost
all

be
remarked

that

add
that

not

with
the
aid
of
our
learned
guide
we
have
now
reached
a
period
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
well
adapted
for
this
general
study
of
the
dress
of
our
ancestors
inasmuch
as
soon
afterwards
men
dress
at
least
and
especially
that
of
young
courtiers
became
most
ridiculously
and
even
indecently
exaggerated
to
such
an
extent
was
this
the
case
that
serious
calamities
having
befallen
the
french
nation
about
this
time
and
its
fashions
having
exercised
a
considerable
influence
over
the
whole
continent
of
europe
contemporary
historians
do
not
hesitate
to
regard
these
public
misfortunes
as
a
providential
chastisement
inflicted
on

disgraceful
extravagance

we
must
believe
that
god
has
permitted
this
as
a
just
judgment
on
us
for
our
sins
say
the

edited

of

unfortunate
battle
of
cressy
although
it
does
not
belong

but
what
we
see
we
testify
to
for
pride
was
very
great
in
france
and
especially
amongst
the
nobles
and
others
that
is
to
say
pride
of
nobility
and
covetousness
there
was
also
much
impropriety
in
dress
and
this
extended
throughout
the
whole
of
france
some
had
their
clothes
so
short
and
so
tight
that
it
required
the
help
of
two
persons
to
dress
and
undress
them
and
whilst
they
were
being
undressed
they
appeared
as
if
they
were
being
skinned
others
wore
dresses
plaited
over
their
loins
like
women
some
had
chaperons
cut
out
in
points
all
round
some
had
tippets
of
one
cloth
others
of
another
and
some
had
their
and
sleeves
reaching
to
the
ground
looking
more
like
mountebanks
than
anything
else
considering
all
this
it
is
not
surprising
if
god
employed
the
king
of
england
as
a
scourge
to
correct
the
excesses
of
the
french
people
and
this
is
not
the
only
testimony
to
the
ridiculous
and
extravagant
tastes
of
this
unfortunate
period

writer
speaks
with
indignation
of
the

two
points
which
seemed
to
put
the
last
finishing
touch
of
ridicule
on
the
already
grotesque
appearance
of
even
the
most
serious
people
of
that
period
another
exclaims
against
the
extravagant
luxury
of
jewels
of
gold
and
silver
and
against
the
wearing
of
feathers
which
latter
then
appeared
for
the
first
time
as
accessories
to
both
male
and
female
attire

censure
and
not
without
reason
the
absurd
fashion
of

ancient
leather
girdle
meant
to
support
the
waist
into
a
kind
of
heavy
padded
band
studded
with
gilded
ornaments
and
precious
stones
and
apparently
invented
expressly
to
encumber
the
person

the
which
had
more
than
ever
come
into

which
were
only
considered
correct

they
were
made
as
a
kind
of
appendix
to
the
foot
measuring
at
least
double
its
length
and
ornamented
in
the
most
fantastical
manner
the
pope
anathematized
this
deformity
as
a
mockery
of
god
and
the
holy
church
and
the
king
forbad
craftsmen
to
make
them
and
his
subjects
to
wear
them
all
this
is
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
profuse
extravagance
displayed
in
furs
which
was
most
outrageous
and
ruinous
and
of
which
we
could
not
form
an
idea
were
it
not
for
the
items
in
certain
royal
documents
from
which
we
gather
that
in
order
to
trim
two
complete
suits
for
king
john
no
fewer
than
six
hundred
and
seventy
martens
skins
were
used
it
is
also
stated
that
the
duke
of
berry
the
youngest
son
of
that
monarch
purchased
nearly
ten
thousand
of
these
same
skins
from
a
distant
country
in
the
north
in
order
to
trim
only
five
mantles
and
as
many
surcoats
we
read
also
that
a
robe
made
for
the
duke
of
orleans
grandson
of
the
same
king
required
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
ninety
ermines
skins
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
that
in
consequence
of
this
large
consumption
skins
could
only
be
purchased
at
the
most
extravagant
prices
for
example
fifty
skins
cost
about
one
hundred
francs
or
about
six
thousand
of
present
currency
showing
to
what
an
enormous
expense
those

were
put

have
already
seen
that
charles
used
his
influence

was
unfortunately
very
limited
in
trying
to
restrain
the
extravagance
of
fashion
this
monarch
did
more
than
decree
laws
against
indelicate
or
unseemly
and
ridiculous
dress
he
himself
never
wore
anything
but
the
long
and
ample
costume
which
was
most
becoming
and
which
had
been
adopted
in
the
preceding
century
his
example
it
is
true
was
little
followed
but
it
nevertheless
had
this
happy
resuit
that
the
advocates
of
short
and
tight
dresses
as
if
suddenly
seized
with
instinctive
modesty
adopted
an
upper
garment

object
of
which
seemed
to
be
to
conceal

absurd
fashions

they
had
not
the
courage
to

themselves

and
ungraceful

of
two
broad
bands

starting

almost
entirely
concealing

only
allowing
the

to

which

opened

a
fact
worthy
of
remark
is
that
whilst

depravity

the
utmost
limit
of
extravagance
women
dress
on
the
contrary
owing
to
a
strenuous
effort
towards
a
dignified

word

the
fashion
of
wearing
false
hair
continued
in
great
favour

middle

fourteenth

it
gave
rise
to
all
sorts

ingenious
combinations

however

hair
being
parted

the
sixteenth
century
in
fact
our
present
fashions
may
be
said
to
have
taken
their
origin
from
about
that
time
it
was
during
this
century
that
men
adopted
clothes
closely
fitting
to
the
body
overcoats
with
tight
sleeves
felt
hats
with
more
or
less
wide
brims
and
closed
shoes
and
boots
the
women
also
wore
their
dresses
closely
fitting
to
the
figure
with
tight
sleeves
hats
and
petticoats
these
garments
which
differ
altogether
from
those
of
antiquity
constitute
as
it
were
the
common
type
from
which
have
since
arisen
the
endless
varieties
of
male
and
female
dress
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
fashion
will
thus
be
continually
changing
backwards
and
forwards
from
time
to
time
sometimes
returning
to
its
original
model
and
sometimes
departing
from
it

and

the
expedition
into
from
miniatures
in
two
manuscripts
of
the
period
in
the
national
library
of
paris
during
the
sixteenth
century
ladies
wore
the
skirts
of
their
dresses
which
were
tight
at
the
waist
and
open
in
front
very
wide
displaying
the
lower
part
of
a
very
rich
under
petticoat
which
reached
to
the
ground
completely
concealing
the
feet
this
like
the
sleeves
with
puffs
which
fell
in
circles
to
the
wrists
was
altogether
an
italian
fashion
frequently
the
hair
was
turned
over
in
rolls
and
adorned
with
precious
stones
and
was
surmounted
by
a
small
cap
coquettishly
placed
either
on
one
side
or
on
the
top
of
the
head
and
ornamented
with
gold
chains
jewels
and
feathers
the
body
of
the
dress
was
always
long
and
pointed
in
front
men
wore
their
coats
cut
somewhat
after
the
same
shape
their
trunk
hose
were
tight
but
round
the
waist
they
were
puffed
out
they
wore
a
cloak
which
only
reached
as
far
as
the
hips
and
was
always
much
ornamented
they
carried
a
smooth
or
ribbed
cap
on
one
side
of
the
head
and
a
small
upright
collar
adorned
the
coat
this
collar
was
replaced
after
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
by
the
high
starched
ruff
which
was
kept
out
by
wires
ladies
wore
it
still
larger
when
it
had
somewhat
the
appearance
of
an
open
fan
at
the
back
of
the
neck
if
we
take
a
retrospective
glance
at
the
numerous
changes
of
costume
which
we
have
endeavoured
to
describe
in
this
hurried
sketch
we
shall
find
that
amongst
european
nations
during
the
middle
ages
there
was
but
one
common
standard
of
fashion
which
varied
from
time
to
time
according
to
the
particular
custom
of
each
country
and
according
to
the
peculiarities
of
each
race
in
italy
for
instance
dress
always
maintained
a
certain
character
of
grandeur
ever
recalling
the
fact
that
the
influence
of
antiquity
was
not
quite
lost
in
germany
and
switzerland
garments
had
generally
a
heavy
and
massive
appearance
in
holland
still
more
so
figs
and
england
uniformly
studied
a
kind
of
instinctive
elegance
and
propriety
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
spain
invariably
partook
of
the
heaviness
peculiar
to
germany
either
because
the
gothic
element
still
prevailed
there
or
that
the
walloon
fashions
had
a
special
attraction
to
her
owing
to
associations
and
general
usage
france
was
then
as
it
is
now
fickle
and
capricious
fantastical
and
wavering
but
not
from
indifference
but
because
she
was
always
ready
to
borrow
from
every
quarter
anything
which
pleased
her
she
however
never
failed
to
put
her
own
stamp
on
whatever
she
adopted
thus
making
any
fashion
essentially
french
even
though
she
had
only
just
borrowed
it
from
spain
england
germany
or
italy
in
all
these
countries
we
have
seen
and
still
see
entire
provinces
adhering
to
some
ancient
costume
causing
them
to
differ
altogether
in
character
from
the
rest
of
the
nation
this
is
simply
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
fashions
have
become
obsolete
in
the
neighbouring
places
for
every
local
costume
faithfully
and
rigorously
preserved
by
any
community
at
a
distance
from
the
centre
of
political
action
or
government
must
have
been
originally
brought
there
by
the
nobles
of
the
country
thus
the
of
anne
of
brittany
is
still
that
of
the
of
penhoét
and
of
labrevack
and
the
of
isabel
of
bavaria
is
still
the
of
normandy

it

became

ridiculous
which
were
worn

down

to
come

at
this
period
the
men
high
hose
were
made
longer
and
fuller
especially
in
spain
and
the
low
countries
and
the
fashion
of
large
soft
boots
made
of
doeskin
or
of
black
morocco
became
universal
on
account
of
their
being
so
comfortable
we
may
remark
that
the
costume
of
the
bourgeois
was
for
a
long
time
almost
unchanged
even
in
the
towns
never
having
adopted
either
the
hose
or
the
balloon
trousers
they
wore
an
easy
jerkin
a
large
cloak
and
a
felt
hat
which
the
english
made
conical
and
with
a
broad
brim
towards
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
high
hose
which
were
worn
by
the
northern
nations
profusely
trimmed
was
transformed
into
the
which
was
full
and
open
at
the
knees
a
division
was
thus
suddenly
made
between
the
lower
and
the
upper
part
of
the
hose
as
if
the
garment
which
covered
the
lower
limbs
had
been
cut
in
two
and
garters
were
then
necessarily
invented
the
felt
hat
became
over
almost
the
whole
of
europe

cap
taking
the
exact
form
of
the
head
and
having
a
wide
flat
brim
turned
up
on

side

were
added
to

which
up
to
that
time
had
been
flat
and
with
single
soles
two
centuries
later
a
terrible
social
agitation
took
place
all
over
europe
after
which
male
attire
became
mean
ungraceful
plain
and
more
paltry
than
ever
whereas
female
dress
the
fashions
of

perpetually
changing
