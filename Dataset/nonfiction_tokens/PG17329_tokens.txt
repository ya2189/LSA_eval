the
least
known
of
all
those
which
held
sway
for
a
time
over
the
destinies
of
a
portion
of
western
asia
the
reason
of
this
is
not
to
be
ascribed
to
the
shortness
of
its
duration
the
chaldæan
empire
of
nebuchadrezzar
lasted
for
a
period
quite
as
brief
and
yet
the
main
outlines
of
its
history
can
be
established
with
some
certainty
in
spite
of
large
blanks
and
much
obscurity
whereas
at
babylon
moreover
original
documents
abound
enabling
us
to
put
together
feature
by
feature
the
picture
of
its
ancient
civilisation
and
of
the
chronology
of
its
kings
we
possess
no
contemporary
monuments
of
ecbatana
to
furnish
direct
information
as
to
its
history
to
form
any
idea
of
the
median
kings
or
their
people
we
are
reduced
to
haphazard
notices
gleaned
from
the
chroniclers
of
other
lands
retailing
a
few
isolated
facts
anecdotes
legends
and
conjectures
and
as
these
materials
reach
us
through
the
medium
of
the
babylonians
or
the
greeks
of
the
fifth
or
sixth
century
the
picture
which
we
endeavour
to
compose
from
them
is
always
imperfect
or
out
of
perspective
we
seemingly
catch
glimpses
of
ostentatious
luxury
of
a
political
and
military
organisation
and
a
method
of
government
analogous
to
that
which
prevailed
at
later
periods
among
the
persians
but
more
imperfect
ruder
and
nearer
to
barbarism
a
persia
in
fact
in
the
rudimentary
stage
with
its
ruling
spirit
and
essential
characteristics
as
yet
undeveloped
the
machinery
of
state
had
doubtless
been
adopted
almost
in
its
entirety
from
the
political
organisations
which
obtained
in
the
kingdoms
of
assyria
elam
and
chaldæa
with
which
sovereignties
the
founders
of
the
median
empire
had
held
in
turns
relations
as
vassals
enemies
and
allies
but
once
we
penetrate
this
veneer
of
mesopotamian
civilisation
and
reach
the
inner
life
of
the
people
we
find
in
the
religion
they
profess
mingled
with
some
borrowed
traits
a
world
of
unfamiliar
myths
and
dogmas
of
native
origin
the
main
outlines
of
this
religion
were
already
fixed
when
the
medes
rose
in
rebellion
against
and
the
very
name
of
fravartîsh
applied
to
the
chief
of
that
day
proves
that
it
was
the
faith
of
the
royal
family
it
was
a
religion
common
to
all
the
iranians
the
persians
as
well
as
the
medes
and
legend
honoured
as
its
first
lawgiver
and
expounder
an
ancient
prophet
named
zarathustra
known
to
us
as
zoroaster
most
classical
writers
relegated
zoroaster
to
some
remote
age
of
antiquity
thus
he
is
variously
said
to
have
lived
six
thousand
years
before
the
death
of
plato
five
thousand
before
the
trojan
war
one
thousand
before
moses
and
six
hundred
before
campaign
against
athens
while
some
few
only
affirmed
that
he
had
lived
at
a
comparatively
recent
period
and
made
him
out
a
disciple
of
the
philosopher
pythagoras
who
flourished
about
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
the
name
zarathustra
has
been
interpreted
in
a
score
of
different
ways
the
greeks
sometimes
attributed
to
it
the
meaning
of
the
stars
probably
by
reason
of
the
similarity
in
sound
of
the
termination
of
zoroaster
with
the
word
among
modern
writers
rawlinson
derived
it
from
the
assyrian
seed
of
ishtar
but
the
etymology
now
most
generally
accepted
is
that
of
burnouf
according
to
which
it
would
signify
man
with
camels
the
of
tawny
the
ordinary
greek
form
zoroaster
seems
to
be
derived
from
some
name
quite
distinct
from
zarathustra
this
was
as
pliny
records
the
opinion
of
eudoxus
not
eudoxus
of
cnidus
pupil
of
plato
as
is
usually
stated
but
a
more
obscure
personage
eudoxus
of
rhodes
this
was
the
statement
of
hermodorus
according
to
the
most
ancient
national
traditions
he
was
born
in
the
or
in
other
words
in
the
region
between
the
araxes
and
the
kur
to
the
west
of
the
caspian
sea
later
tradition
asserted
that
his
conception
was
attended
by
supernatural
circumstances
and
the
miracles
which
accompanied
his
birth
announced
the
advent
of
a
saint
destined
to
regenerate
the
world
by
the
revelation
of
the
true
law
in
the
belief
of
an
iranian
every
man
every
living
creature
now
existing
or
henceforth
to
exist
not
excluding
the
gods
themselves
possesses
a
frôhar
or
guardian
spirit
who
is
assigned
to
him
at
his
entrance
into
the
world
and
who
is
thenceforth
devoted
entirely
to
watching
over
his
material
and
moral
about
the
time
appointed
for
the
appearance
of
the
prophet
his
frôhar
was
by
divine
grace
imprisoned
in
the
heart
of
a
haoma
and
was
absorbed
along
with
the
juice
of
the
plant
by
the
priest
purushâspa
during
a
sacrifice
a
ray
of
heavenly
glory
descending
at
the
same
time
into
the
bosom
of
a
maiden
of
noble
race
named
dughdôva
whom
purushâspa
shortly
afterwards
espoused
the
fravashi
for
from
support
or
the
feruer
is
properly
speaking
the
nurse
the
genius
who
nurtures
many
of
the
practices
relating
to
the
conception
and
cult
of
the
fravashis
seem
to
me
to
go
back
to
the
primitive
period
of
the
iranian
religions
the
haoma
is
an
sarcostema
the
name
signifies
who
has
many
zoroaster
was
engendered
from
the
mingling
of
the
frôhar
with
the
celestial
ray
the
evil
spirit
whose
supremacy
he
threatened
endeavoured
to
destroy
him
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
light
and
despatched
one
of
his
agents
named
bôuiti
from
the
country
of
the
far
north
to
oppose
him
but
the
infant
prophet
immediately
pronounced
the
formula
with
which
the
psalm
for
the
offering
of
the
waters
opens
will
of
the
lord
is
the
rule
of
good
and
proceeded
to
pour
libations
in
honour
of
the
river
darêja
on
the
banks
of
which
he
had
been
born
a
moment
before
reciting
at
the
same
time
the
of
faith
which
puts
evil
spirits
to
bôuiti
fled
aghast
but
his
master
set
to
work
upon
some
fresh
device
zoroaster
allowed
him
however
no
time
to
complete
his
plans
he
rose
up
and
undismayed
by
the
malicious
riddles
propounded
to
him
by
his
adversary
advanced
against
him
with
his
hands
full
of
stones
stones
as
large
as
a
house
with
which
the
good
deity
supplied
him
the
mere
sight
of
him
dispersed
the
demons
and
they
regained
the
gates
of
their
hell
in
headlong
flight
shrieking
out
shall
we
succeed
in
destroying
him
for
he
is
the
weapon
which
strikes
down
evil
beings
he
is
the
scourge
of
evil
his
infancy
and
youth
were
spent
in
constant
disputation
with
evil
spirits
ever
assailed
he
ever
came
out
victorious
and
issued
more
perfect
from
each
attack
when
he
was
thirty
years
old
one
of
the
good
spirits
vôhumanô
appeared
to
him
and
conducted
him
into
the
presence
of
the
supreme
being
when
invited
to
question
the
deity
zoroaster
asked
is
the
best
of
the
creatures
which
are
upon
the
earth
the
answer
was
that
the
man
whose
heart
is
pure
he
excels
among
his
fellows
he
next
desired
to
know
the
names
and
functions
of
the
angels
and
the
nature
and
attributes
of
evil
his
instruction
ended
he
crossed
a
mountain
of
flames
and
underwent
a
terrible
ordeal
of
purification
during
which
his
breast
was
pierced
with
a
sword
and
melted
lead
poured
into
his
entrails
without
his
suffering
any
pain
only
after
this
ordeal
did
he
receive
from
the
hands
of
the
book
of
the
law
the
avesta
was
then
sent
back
to
his
native
land
bearing
his
precious
burden
at
that
time
vîshtâspa
son
of
aurvatâspa
was
reigning
over
bactria
for
ten
years
zoroaster
had
only
one
disciple
his
cousin
but
after
that
he
succeeded
in
converting
one
after
the
other
the
two
sons
of
hvôgva
the
grand
vizir
jâmâspa
who
afterwards
married
the
daughter
and
frashaoshtra
whose
daughter
hvôgvi
he
himself
espoused
the
queen
hutaosa
was
the
next
convert
and
afterwards
through
her
persuasions
the
king
vîshtâspa
himself
became
a
disciple
the
triumph
of
the
good
cause
was
hastened
by
the
result
of
a
formal
disputation
between
the
prophet
and
the
wise
men
of
the
court
for
three
days
they
essayed
to
bewilder
him
with
their
captious
objections
and
their
magic
arts
thirty
standing
on
his
right
hand
and
thirty
on
his
left
but
he
baffled
their
wiles
aided
by
grace
from
above
and
having
forced
them
to
avow
themselves
at
the
end
of
their
resources
he
completed
his
victory
by
reciting
the
avesta
before
them
the
legend
adds
that
after
rallying
the
majority
of
the
people
round
him
he
lived
to
a
good
old
age
honoured
of
all
men
for
his
saintly
life
according
to
some
accounts
he
was
stricken
dead
by
lightning
while
others
say
he
was
killed
by
a
turanian
soldier
in
a
war
against
the
hyaonas
this
is
under
very
diverse
forms
the
version
preferred
by
western
historians
of
the
period
the
question
has
often
been
asked
whether
zoroaster
belongs
to
the
domain
of
legend
or
of
history
the
only
certain
thing
we
know
concerning
him
is
his
name
all
the
rest
is
mythical
poetic
or
religious
fiction
classical
writers
attributed
to
him
the
composition
or
editing
of
all
the
writings
comprised
in
persian
literature
the
whole
consisted
they
said
of
two
hundred
thousand
verses
which
had
been
expounded
and
analysed
by
hermippus
in
his
commentaries
on
the
secret
doctrines
of
the
magi
the
iranians
themselves
averred
that
he
had
given
the
world
volumes
the
of
the
avesta
which
the
supreme
deity
had
created
from
the
words
of
the
magian
profession
of
faith
the
king
vîshtâspa
is
said
to
have
caused
two
authentic
copies
of
the
avesta
which
contained
in
all
ten
or
twelve
hundred
to
be
made
one
of
which
was
consigned
to
the
archives
of
the
empire
the
other
laid
up
in
the
treasury
of
a
fortress
either
shapîgân
shîzîgân
samarcand
or
persepolis
the
word
in
pehlevi
whence
come
the
persian
forms
is
derived
from
the
achæmenian
word
which
signifies
in
the
inscriptions
of
darius
the
term
commonly
used
to
designate
the
sacred
book
of
the
persians
is
incorrectly
derived
from
the
expression
u
which
in
pehlevi
designates
first
the
law
itself
and
then
the
translation
and
commentary
in
more
modern
language
which
conduces
to
a
zend
of
the
law
the
customary
application
therefore
of
the
name
zend
to
the
language
of
the
avesta
is
incorrect
the

to

the

the

contained
pages
and
the
whole
of
these
writings
had
been
inscribed
on
the
site

unknown
darmesteter

that
it
ought

james
darmesteter
has
given
good
reasons
for
believing
that
this
valkash
is
vologesus
i
the
contemporary
of
nero
this
is
the
tradition
reproduced
in
two
versions
of
the
dinkart
darmesteter
declares
that
ancient
zoroastrianism
is
in
its
main
lines
the
religion
of
the
median
magi
even
though
he
assigns
the
latest
possible
date
to
the
composition
of
the
avesta
as
now
existing
and
thinks
he
can
discern
in
it
greek
jewish
and
christian
elements
it
is
a
complicated
system
of
religion
and
presupposes
a
long
period
of
development
the
doctrines
are
subtle
the
ceremonial
order
of
worship
loaded
with
strict
observances
is
interrupted
at
every
moment
by
laws
prescribing
minute
details
of
ritual
which
were
only
put
in
practice
by
priests
and
strict
devotees
and
were
unknown
to
the
mass
of
the
faithful
renan
defined
the
avesta
as
code
of
a
very
small
religious
sect
it
is
a
talmud
a
book
of
casuistry
and
strict
observance
i
have
difficulty
in
believing
that
the
great
persian
empire
which
at
least
in
religious
matters
professed
a
certain
breadth
of
ideas
could
have
had
a
law
so
strict
i
think
that
had
the
persians
possessed
a
sacred
book
of
this
description
the
greeks
must
have
mentioned
the
primitive
base
of
this
religion
is
difficult
to
discern
clearly
but
we
may
recognise
in
it
most
of
those
beings
or
personifications
of
natural
phenomena
which
were
the
chief
objects
of

his

however
can
only
exist
by

of

to
which
he
gives
activity
the
incompatibility
of
tendency
displayed
by
these
forces
and
their
alternations
of
growth
and
decay
inspired
the
iranians
with
the
idea
that
they
were
the
result
of
two
contradictory
principles
the
one
beneficent
and
good
the
other
adverse
to
everything
emanating
from
the
former
spiegel
who
at
first
considered
that
the
iranian
dualism
was
derived
from
polytheism
and
was
a
preliminary
stage
in
the
development
of
monotheism
held
afterwards
that
a
rigid
monotheism
had
preceded
this
dualism
the
classical
writers
who
knew
zoroastrianism
at
the
height
of
its
glory
never
suggested
that
the
two
principles
might
be
derived
from
a
superior
principle
nor
that
they
were
subject
to
such
a
principle
the
iranian
books
themselves
nowhere
definitely
affirm
that
there
existed
a
single
principle
distinct
from
the
two
opposing
principles
in
opposition
to
the
god
of
light
they
necessarily
formed
the
idea
of
a
god
of
darkness
the
god
of
the
underworld
who
presides
over
death
the
two
opposing
principles
reigned
at
first
each
in
his
own
domain
as
rivals
but
not
as
irreconcilable
adversaries
they
were
considered
as
in
fixed
opposition
to
each
other
and
as
having
coexisted
for
ages
without
coming
into
actual
conflict
separated
as
they
were
by
the
intervening
void
as
long
as
the
principle
of
good
was
content
to
remain
shut
up
inactive
in
his
barren
glory
the
principle
of
evil
slumbered
unconscious
in
a
darkness
that
knew
no
beginning
but
when
at
last
spirit
who
giveth
determined
to
manifest
himself
the
first
throes
of
his
vivifying
activity
roused
from
inertia
the
spirit
of
destruction
and
of
pain
the
heaven
was
not
yet
in

nor
the
waters
nor
the
earth
nor
ox
nor
fire
nor
man
nor
demons
nor
brute
beasts
nor
any
living
thing
when
the
evil
spirit
hurled
himself
upon
the
light
to
quench
it
for
ever
but
had
already
called
forth
the
ministers
of
his
will

and

the

mainyus
realised
that
he
had
been
tricked
into
taking
a
false
step
but
it
was
not
till
after
three
thousand
years
that
he
decided
to
break
the
truce
and
open
the
conflict
the
strife
kindled
at
the

of

between
the
two

gone
on

with
alternations
of
success
and
defeat
each
in

has
the
victory
for
a
regular
period
of
three
thousand
years
but
when
these
periods
are
ended
at
the

of
twelve
thousand

evil
will
be
finally
and
for
ever
defeated

this
blessed
fulness
of

himself
in

that
is

so
is
to
be
perceived
in
all
that
is
hateful

in

sin

the

he
opposed
the
daêvas
who
never
cease
to
torment
mankind
and
so
through
all
the
ranks
of
nature
he
set
over
against
each
good
and
useful
creation
a
of
rival
tendency
a
fly
he
crept
and
infected

he
rendered
the

as
dark
at

noonday
as
in

he
covered
the

with
vermin
with
his
creatures
of
venomous
bite
and
poisonous
sting
with
serpents
scorpions
and
frogs
so
that
there
was
not
a

as
small
as

swarmed
with

vermin
he
smote

of
a
sudden
the

withered
he
attacked
the
flames
and
mingled
them
with
smoke
and
dimness
the
planets
with
their
thousands
of
demons
dashed
against
the
vault
of
heaven
and
waged
war
on
the
stars
and
the
universe
became
darkened
like
a
space
which
the
fire
blackens
with
its

the
conflict
grew
ever
keener

towards

bound
to

the
original

in
a

enigmatical
fashion

of

the

the

he
will
give

by
so
doing

wound

never

will
extend
even
to

their
complaints
heard
in

shall
be
fatal

him

condemn
to

the
cruel
man
who
has
the
ox
or
allowed
his

of
a

is
no
less
severely
punished

not
a

who
steal
the
grain
the
dog
is
in
every
case
an
especially
sacred
animal
the
dog
the
watchdog
the
even
the
prowling
dog
it
is
not
lawful
to
give
any
dog
a
blow
which
renders
him
impotent
or
to
slit
his
ears
or
to
cut
his
foot
without
incurring
grave
responsibilities
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
it
is
necessary
to
feed
the
dog
well
and
not
to
throw
bones
to
him
which
are
too
hard
nor
have
his
food
served
hot
enough
to
burn
his
tongue
or
his
throat
for
the
rest
the
faithful
zoroastrian
was
bound
to
believe
in
his
god
to
offer
to
him
the
orthodox
prayers
and
sacrifices
to
be
simple
in
heart
truthful
the
slave
of
his
pledged
word
loyal
in
his
very
smallest
acts
if
he
had
once
departed
from
the
right
way
he
could
only
return
to
it
by
repentance
and
by
purification
accompanied
by
pious
deeds
to
exterminate
noxious
animals
the
creatures
of
and
the
abode
of
his
demons
such
as
the
frog
the
scorpion
the
serpent
or
the
ant
to
clear
the
sterile
tracts
to
restore
impoverished
land
to
construct
bridges
over
running
water
to
distribute
implements
of
husbandry
to
pions
men
or
to
build
them
a
house
to
give
a
pure
and
healthy
maiden
in
marriage
to
a
just
man
these
were
so
many
means
of
expiation
appointed
by
the
prophet
marriage
was
strictly
obligatory
and
seemed
more
praiseworthy
in
proportion
as
the
kinship
existing
between
the
married
pair
was
the
closer
not
only
was
the
sister
united
in
marriage
to
her
brother
as
in
egypt
but
the
father
to
his
daughter
and
the
mother
to
her
son
at
least
among
the
magi
a
passage
in
the
even
enumerates
how
many
noisome
beasts
must
be
slain
to
accomplish
one
full
work
of
expiation
kill
serpents
of
those
who
drag
themselves
upon
the
belly
and
of
the
other
species
land
frogs
or
water
frogs
ants
who
steal
the
grain
and
so
on
the
says
i
tell
thee
o
spitama
zarathustra
the
man
who
has
a
wife
is
above
him
who
lives
in
continency
and
as
we
have
seen
in
the
text
one
of
these
forms
of
expiation
consisted
in
to
a
worthy
man
a
young
girl
who
has
never
known
a
herodotus
of
old
remarked
that
one
of
the
chief
merits
in
an
iranian
was
to
have
many
children
the
king
of
persia
encouraged
fecundity
in
his
realm
and
awarded
a
prize
each
year
to
that
one
of
his
subjects
who
could
boast
the
most
numerous
progeny
polygamy
was
also
encouraged
and
widely
practised
the
code
imposed
no
limit
on
the
number
of
wives
and
concubines
and
custom
was
in
favour
of
a
having
as
many
wives
as
his
fortune
permitted
him
to
maintain
on
the
occasion
of
a
death
it
was
forbidden
to
burn
the
corpse
to
bury
it
or
to
cast
it
into
a
river
as
it
would
have
polluted
the
fire
the
earth
or
the
water
an
unpardonable
offence
the
corpse
could
be
disposed
of
in
different
ways
the
persians
were
accustomed
to
cover
it
with
a
thick
layer
of
wax
and
then
to
bury
it
in
the
ground
the
wax
coating
obviated
the
pollution
which
direct
contact
would
have
brought
upon
the
soil
the
magi
and
probably
also
strict
devotees
following
their
example
exposed
the
corpse
in
the
open
air
abandoning
it
to
the
birds
or
beasts
of
prey
it
was
considered
a
great
misfortune
if
these
respected
the
body
for
it
was
an
almost
certain
indication
of
the
wrath
of
and
it
was
thought
that
the
defunct
had
led
an
evil
life
when
the
bones
had
been
sufficiently
stripped
of
flesh
they
were
collected
together
and
deposited
either
in
an
earthenware
urn
or
in
a
stone
ossuary
with
a
cover
or
in
a
monumental
tomb
either
hollowed
out
in
the
heart
of
the
mountain
or
in
the
living
rock
or
raised
up
above
the
level
of
the
ground
meanwhile
the
soul
remained
in
the
neighbourhood
for
three
days
hovering
near
the
head
of
the
corpse
and
by
the
recitation
of
prayers
it
experienced
according
to
its
condition
of
purity
or
impurity
as
much
of
joy
or
sadness
as
the
whole
world
experiences
when
the
third
night
was
past
the
just
soul
set
forth
across
luminous
plains
refreshed
by
a
perfumed
breeze
and
its
good
thoughts
and
words
and
deeds
took
shape
before
it
the
guise
of
a
young
maiden
radiant
and
strong
with
bust
noble
mien
and
glorious
face
about
fifteen
years
of
age
and
as
beautiful
as
the
most
beautiful
the
unrighteous
soul
on
the
contrary
directed
its
course
towards
the
north
through
a
tainted
land
amid
the
squalls
of
a
pestilential
hurricane
and
there
encountered
its
past
ill
deeds
under
the
form
of
an
ugly
and
wicked
young
woman
the
ugliest
and
most
wicked
it
had
ever
seen
the
genius
rashnu
razishta
the
essentially
truthful
weighed
its
virtues
or
vices
in
an
unerring
balance
and
acquitted
or
condemned
it
on
the
impartial
testimony
of
its
past
life
on
issuing
from
the
the
soul
arrived
at
the
approach
to
the
bridge
cinvaut
which
thrown
across
the
abyss
of
hell
led
to
paradise
the
soul
if
impious
was
unable
to
cross
this
bridge
but
was
hurled
down
into
the
abyss
where
it
became
the
slave
of
if
pure
it
crossed
the
bridge
without
difficulty
by
the
help
of
the
angel
sraôsha
and
was
welcomed
by
who
conducted
it
before
the
throne
of
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
led
zoroaster
and
assigned
to
it
the
post
which
it
should
occupy
until
the
day
of
the
resurrection
of
the
body
all
this
picture
of
the
fate
of
the
soul
is
taken
from
the
where
the
fate
of
the
just
is
described
and
in
the
where
the
condition
of
faithful
and
impious
souls
respectively
is
set
forth
on
parallel
lines
the
classical
authors
teach
us
nothing
on
this
subject
and
the
little
they
actually
say
only
proves
that
the
persians
believed
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
main
outlines
of
the
picture
here
set
forth
go
back
to
the
times
of
the
achæmenids
and
the
medes
except
the
abstract
conception
of
the
goddess
who
leads
the
soul
of
the
dead
as
an
incarnation
of
his
good
or
evil
deeds
the
religious
observances
enjoined
on
the
members
of
the
priestly
caste
were
innumerable
and
minute
and
his
colleagues
had
not
as
was
the
fashion
among
the
assyrians
and
egyptians
either
temples
or
tabernacles
and
though
they
were
represented
sometimes
under
human
or
animal
forms
and

is
opposed
to
the
spirit

is
undoubtedly
the
case
as

as

form

religion
is
concerned

the
testimony
of

is
so
plain
that
the
fact
itself
must
be
considered
as
indisputable
we
may
note
that
the
passage
refers
to
the
foundation
of

city
and
if
we
remember
how
persistent
was
the
custom
of
human
sacrifice
among
ancient
races
at
the
foundation
of
buildings
we
shall
be
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ceremony
described
by
the
greek
historian
was
a
survival
of
a
very
ancient
usage
which
had
not
yet
fallen
entirely
into
desuetude

the
achæmenian
epoch

the

on

was
in

a

was

able

no

the
ceremony
was
to
take

and
there
the
priest
wearing
the

on

recited
an
invocation
in
a
slow
and
mysterious
voice
and
implored
the
blessings
of

he
then
slaughtered
the
victim
by

some

entrails
were
taken
to
feed

sometimes
even
this
was
omitted

were
of
frequent
occurrence
without
mentioning
the
extraordinary
occasions
on
which
a

of
which
was

the
ceremonial
bore
resemblance
in
many
ways
to
that
still
employed
by
the
modern
zoroastrians
of
persia
and

a
relic
of
this
custom
may
be

certainly

in

the

this

draught
was

the
rays
never
shone
and
was
there
sprinkled
on

menander
speaks
of
this
festival
as
conducted
in
his
own
times
and
tells
us
that
it
was
called
eurdigan
modern
authorities
usually
admit
that
it
goes
back
to
the
times
of
the
achæmenids
or
even
beyond

says
that
every
worshipper

is
enjoined
to
kill
the
greatest
possible
number
of
animals
created
by
and
bring
to
the
magi
the
fruits
of
his
hunting
herodotus
had
already
spoken
of
this
destruction
of
life
as
one
of
the
duties
incumbent
on
every
persian
and
this
gives
probability
to
the
view
of
modern
writers
that
the
festival
went
back
to
the
achæmenian
epoch
the
festival
of
the
sakoa
is
mentioned
by
ctesias
it
was
also
a
babylonian
festival
and
most
modern
authorities
conclude
from
this
double
use
of
the
name
that
the
festival
was
borrowed
from
the
babylonians
by
the
persians
but
this
point
is
not
so
certain
as
it
is
made
out
to
be
and
at
any
rate
the
borrowing
must
have
taken
place
very
early
for
the
festival
was
already
well
established
in
the
achæmenian
period
all
the
magi
were
not
necessarily
devoted
to
the
priesthood
but
those
only
became
apt
in
the
execution
of
their
functions
who
had
been
dedicated
to
them
from
infancy
and
who
having
received
the
necessary
instruction
were
duly
consecrated
these
adepts
were
divided
into
several
classes
of
which
three
at
least
were
never
confounded
in
their
functions
the
sorcerers
the
interpreters
of
dreams
and
the
most
venerated
sages
and
from
these
three
classes
were
chosen
the
ruling
body
of
the
order
and
its
supreme
head
their
rule
of
life
was
strict
and
austere
and
was
encumbered
with
a
thousand
observances
indispensable
to
the
preservation
of
perfect
purity
in
their
persons
their
altars
their
victims
and
their
sacrificial
vessels
and
implements
the
magi
of
highest
rank
abstained
from
every
form
of
living
thing
as
food
and
the
rest
only
partook
of
meat
under
certain
restrictions
their
dress
was
unpretentious
they
wore
no
jewels
and
observed
strict
fidelity
to
the
marriage
vow
and
the
virtues
with
which
they
were
accredited
obtained
for
them
from
very
early
times
unbounded
influence
over
the
minds
of
the
common
people
as
well
as
over
those
of
the
nobles
the
king
himself
boasted
of
being
their
pupil
and
took
no
serious
step
in
state
affairs
without
consulting
or
the
other
gods
by
their
mediation
the
classical
writers
maintain
that
the
magi
often
cloaked
monstrous
vices
under
their
apparent
strictness
and
it
is
possible
that
this
was
the
case
in
later
days
but
even
then
moral
depravity
was
probably
rather
the
exception
than
the
rule
among
them
the
majority
of
the
magi
faithfully
observed
the
rules
of
honest
living
and
ceremonial
purity
enjoined
on
them
in
the
books
handed
down
by
their
ancestors
clement
of
alexandria
assures
us
that
they
were
strictly
celibate
but
besides
the
fact
that
married
magi
are
mentioned
several
times
celibacy
is
still
considered
by
zoroastrians
an
inferior
state
to
that
of
marriage
in
the
greek
period
a
spurious
epitaph
of
darius
son
of
hystaspes
was
quoted
in
which
the
king
says
of
himself
was
the
pupil
of
the
these
accusations
are
nearly
all
directed
against
their
incestuous
marriages
it
seems
that
the
classical
writers
took
for
a
refinement
of
debauchery
what
really
was
before
all
things
a
religious
practice
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
magi
were
among
the
medes
and
that
the
reign
of
astyages
was
virtually
the
reign
of
the
priestly
caste
but
all
the
iranian
states
did
not
submit
so
patiently
to
their
authority
and
the
persians
at
last
proved
openly
refractory
their
kings
lords
of
susa
as
well
as
of
pasargadse
wielded
all
the
resources
of
elam
and
their
military
power
must
have
equalled
if
it
did
not
already
surpass
that
of
their
suzerain
lords
their
tribes
less
devoted
to
the
manner
of
living
of
the
assyrians
and
chaldæans
had
preserved
a
vigour
and
power
of
endurance
which
the
medes
no
longer
possessed
and
they
needed
but
an
ambitious
and
capable
leader
to
rise
rapidly
from
the
rank
of
subjects
to
that
of
rulers
of
iran
and
to
become
in
a
short
time
masters
of
asia
such
a
chief
they
found
in
cyrus
son
of
cambyses
but
although
no
more
illustrious
name
than
his
occurs
in
the
list
of
the
founders
of
mighty
empires
the
history
of
no
other
has
suffered
more
disfigurement
from
the
imagination
of
his
own
subjects
or
from
the
rancour
of
the
nations
he
had
conquered
the
original
form
of
the
name
is
kûru
kûrush
with
a
long
which
forces
us
to
reject
the
proposed
connection
with
the
name
of
the
indian
hero
kuru
in
which
the
is
short
numerous
etymologies
of
the
name
cyrus
have
been
proposed
the
persians
themselves
attributed
to
it
the
sense
of
we
possess
two
entirely
different
versions
of
the
history
of
the
origin
of
cyrus
but
one
that
of
herodotus
has
reached
us
intact
while
that
of
ctesias
is
only
known
to
us
in
fragments
from
extracts
made
by
nicolas
of
damascus
and
by
photius
spiegel
and
duncker
thought
to
recognise
in
the
tradition
followed
by
ctesias
one
of
the
persian
accounts
of
the
history
of
cyrus
but
bauer
refuses
to
admit
this
hypothesis
and
prefers
to
consider
it
as
a
romance
put
together
by
the
author
according
to
the
taste
of
his
own
times
from
facts
partly
different
from
those
utilised
by
herodotus
and
partly
borrowed
from
herodotus
himself
but
it
should
very
probably
be
regarded
as
an
account
of
median
origin
in
which
the
founder
of
the
persian
empire
is
portrayed
in
the
most
unfavourable
light
or
perhaps
it
may
be
regarded
as
the
form
of
the
legend
current
among
the
pharnaspids
who
established
themselves
as
satraps
of
dascylium
in
the
time
of
the
achæmenids
and
to
whom
the
royal
house
of
cappadocia
traced
its
origin
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
account
given
by
herodotus
represents
a
median
version
of
the
legend
and
considering
the
important
part
played
in
it
by
harpagus
probably
that
version
which
was
current
among
the
descendants
of
that
nobleman
the
historian
dinon
as
far
as
we
can
judge
from

extant
fragments
of
his
work

not

holding

of
tortuous

despicable
methods

not

to
the
court
at
ecbatana
and
obtained
from
astyages
permission
to
repair
to
his
native
country
under
pretext
of
offering
sacrifices
but
in
reality
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
conspirators
how
finally
the
indiscretion
of
a
woman
revealed
the
whole
plot
to
a
eunuch
of
the
harem
and
how
he
warned
astyages
in
the
middle
of
his
evening
banquet
by
means
of
a
musician
or
was
frequently
narrated
by
the
median
bards
in
their
epic
poems
and
hence
the
story
spread
until
it
reached
in
later
times
even
as
far
as
the
greeks
according
to
ctesias
it
was
a
who
revealed
the
existence
of
the

astyages
according
to

after
he

to
the

leading
to

and
for
the
second
time
fortune
is
on
the
point

declaring
in
his
favour
when
the
persian

their

to

save
for

in

at

his
daughter
amytis
and
his
spitamas
concealed
him
so
successfully
on
the
top
of
the
palace
that
he
escaped
discovery
up
to
the
moment
when
cyrus
was
on
the
point
of
torturing
his
grandchildren
to
force
them
to
reveal
his
thereupon
he
gave
himself
up
to
his
enemies
but
was
at
length
after
being
subjected
to
harsh
treatment
for
a
time
set
at
liberty
and
entrusted
with
the
government
of
a
mountain
tribe
dwelling
to
the
of
the

that
of
the
barcanians
later
on
he
perished
through
the
treachery
of
oebaras
and
his
corpse
was
left
unburied
in
the
desert
but
by
divine
interposition
relays
of
lions
were
sent
to
guard
it
from
the
attacks
of
beasts
of
prey
cyrus
acquainted
with
this
miraculous
circumstance
went
in
search
of
the
body
and
gave
it
a
magnificent
burial
another
legend
asserted
on
the
contrary
that
cyrus
was
closely
connected
with
the
royal
line
of
cyaxares
this
tradition
was
originally
circulated
among
the
great
median
families
who
attached
themselves
to
the
achaemenian
dynasty
the
passage
in
herodotus
leads
marquart
to
believe
that
the
murder
of
astyages
formed
part
of
the
primitive
legend
but
was
possibly
attributed
to
cambysos
son
of
cyrus
rather
than
to
oebaras
the
companion
of
the
early
years
this
is
the
legend
as
told
to
herodotus
in
asia
minor
probably
by
the
members
of
the
family
of
harpagus
which
the
greek
historian
tried
to
render
credible
by
interpreting
the
miraculous
incidents
in
a
rationalising
manner
illustration
remains
of
the
palace
of
ecbatana
drawn
by
boudier
from
coste
and
flandin
according
to
this
legend
astyages
had
no
male
heirs
and
the
sceptre
would
have
naturally
descended
from
him
to
his
daughter
mandanê
and
her
sons
astyages
was
much
alarmed
by
a
certain
dream
concerning
his
daughter
he
dreamt
that
water
gushed
forth
so
copiously
from
her
womb
as
to
flood
not
only
ecbatana
but
the
whole
of
asia
and
the
interpreters
as
much
terrified
as
himself
counselled
him
not
to
give
mandanê
in
marriage
to
a
persian
noble
of
the
race
of
the
achæmenids
named
cambyses
but
a
second
dream
soon
troubled
the
security
into
which
this
union
had
lulled
him
he
saw
issuing
from
his
womb
a
vine
whose
branches
overshadowed
asia
and
the
interpreters
being
once
more
consulted
predicted
that
a
grandson
was
about
to
be
born
to
him
whose
ambition
would
cost
him
his
crown
he
therefore
bade
a
certain
nobleman
of
his
court
named
harpagus
he
whose
descendants
preserved
this
version
of
the
story
of
cyrus
to
seize
the
infant
and
put
it
to
death
as
soon
as
its
mother
should
give
it
birth
but
the
man
touched
with
pity
caused
the
child
to
be
exposed
in
the
woods
by
one
of
the
royal
shepherds
a
bitch
gave
suck
to
the
tiny
creature
who
however
would
soon
have
succumbed
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
had
not
the
wife
being
lately
delivered
of
a
son
persuaded
her
husband
to
rescue
the
infant
whom
she
nursed
with
the
same
tenderness
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
child
the
dog
was
as
we
know
a
sacred
animal
among
the
iranians
the
incident
of
the
bitch
seems
then
to
have
been
regarded
by
them
as
an
indication
of
divine
intervention
but
the
greeks
were
shocked
by
the
idea
and
invented
an
explanation
consonant
with
their
own
customs
they
supposed
that
the
woman
had
borne
the
name
of
spakô
spakô
signifying
in
the
language
of
media
herodotus
asserts
that
the
was
called
in
greek
in
median
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
for
means
in
median
further
on
he
asserts
that
the
parents
of
the
child
heard
of
the
name
of
his
nurse
with
joy
as
being
of
good
augury
in
order
that
the
persians
might
think
that
cyrus
had
been
preserved
alive
by
divine
agency
spread
abroad
the
report
that
cyrus
had
been
suckled
by
a
and
thus
arose
the
fable
commonly
trogus
pompeius
received
the
original
story
probably
through
dinon
and
inserted
it
in
his
book
cyrus
grew
to
boyhood
and
being
accepted
by
mandanê
as
her
son
returned
to
the
court
his
grandfather
consented
to
spare
his
life
but
to
avenge
himself
on
harpagus
he
caused
the
limbs
of
the
own
son
to
be
served
up
to
him
at
a
feast
thenceforth
harpagus
had
but
one
idea
to
overthrow
the
tyrant
and
transfer
the
crown
to
the
young
prince
his
project
succeeded
and
cyrus
having
overcome
astyages
was
proclaimed
king
by
the
medes
as
well
as
by
the
persians
the
real
history
of
cyrus
as
far
as
we
can
ascertain
it
was
less
romantic
we
gather
that
kurush
known
to
us
as
cyrus
succeeded
his
father
cambyses
as
ruler
of
anshân
about
or
and
that
he
revolted
against
astyages
in
or
and
defeated
him
the
median
army
thereupon
seizing
its
own
leader
delivered
him
into
the
hands
of
the
conqueror
ecbatana
was
taken
and
sacked
and
the
empire
fell
at
one
blow
or
more
properly
speaking
underwent
a
transformation
the
transformation
was
in
fact
an
internal
revolution
in
which
the
two
peoples
of
the
same
race
changed
places
the
name
of
the
medes
lost
nothing
of
the
prestige
which
it
enjoyed
in
foreign
lands
but
that
of
the
persians
was
henceforth
united
with
it
and
shared
its
renown
like
astyages
and
his
predecessors
cyrus
and
his
successors
reigned
equally
over
the
two
leading
branches
of
the
ancient
iranian
stock
but
whereas
the
former
had
been
kings
of
the
medes
and
persians
the
latter
became
henceforth
kings
of
the
persians
and
medes
the
length
of
reign
is
fixed
at
thirty
years
by
ctesias
followed
by
dinon
and
trogus
pompeius
but
at
years
by
herodotus
whose
computation
i
here
follow
hitherto
the
beginning
of
his
reign
has
been
made
to
coincide
with
the
fall
of
astyages
which
was
consequently
placed
in
or
but
the
discovery
of
the
of
obliges
us
to
place
the
taking
of
ecbatana
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
babylonian
king
which
corresponds
to
the
year
and
consequently
to
hold
that
cyrus
reckoned
his
years
from
the
moment
when
he
succeeded
his
father
cambyses
the
inscription
on
the
cylinder
of
seems
to
make
the
fall
of
the
median
king
who
was
suzerain
of
the
scythians
of
harrân
coincide
with
the
third
year
of
nabonidus
or
the
year
but
it
is
only
the
date
of
the
commencement
of
hostilities
between
cyrus
and
astyages
which
is
here
furnished
and
this
manner
of
interpreting
the
text
agrees
with
the
statement
of
the
median
traditions
handed
down
by
the
classical
authors
that
three
combats
took
place
between
astyages
and
cyrus
before
the
final
victory
of
the
persians
this
equality
of
the
two
peoples
is
indicated
by
the
very
terms
employed
by
darius
whom
he
speaks
of
them
in
the
inscription
of
he
says
for
example
in
connection
with
the
revolt
of
the
false
smerdis
that
deception
prevailed
greatly
in
the
land
in
persia
and
media
as
well
as
in
the
other
provinces
and
further
on
that
whole
people
rose
and
passed
over
from
cambyses
to
him
persia
and
media
as
well
as
the
other
in
the
same
way
he
mentions
army
of
persians
and
medes
which
was
with
him
and
one
sees
that
he
considered
medes
and
persians
to
be
on
exactly
the
same
footing
the
change
effected
was
so
natural
that
their
nearest
neighbours
the
chaldæans
showed
no
signs
of
uneasiness
at
the
outset
they
confined
themselves
to
the
bare
registration
of
the
fact
in
their
annals
at
the
appointed
date
without
comment
and
nabonidus
in
no
way
deviated
from
the
pious
routine
which
it
had
hitherto
pleased
him
to
follow
under
a
sovereign
so
there
was
little
likelihood
of
war
at
all
events
with
external
foes
but
insurrections
were
always
breaking
out
in
different
parts
of
his
territory
and
we
read
of
difficulties
in
khumê
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
in
hamath
in
his
second
year
and
troubles
in
plionicia
in
the
third
year
which
afforded
an
opportunity
for
settling
the
tyrian
question
tyre
had
led
a
far
from
peaceful
existence
ever
since
the
day
when
from
sheer
apathy
she
had
accepted
the
supremacy
of
nebuchadrezzar
all
these
events
are
known
through
the
excerpt
from
menander
preserved
to
us
by
josephus
in
his
treatise
baal
ii
had
peacefully
reigned
there
for
ten
years
but
after
his
death
the
people
had
overthrown
the
monarchy
and
various
had
followed
one
another
rapidly
eknibaal
ruled
two
months
khelbes
ten
months
the
high
priest
abbar
three
months
the
two
brothers
mutton
and
gerastratus
six
years
all
of
them
no
doubt
in
the
midst
of
endless
disturbances
whereupon
a
certain
baalezor
restored
the
royal
dignity
but
only
to
enjoy
it
for
the
space
of
one
year
on
his
death
the
inhabitants
begged
the
chaldæans
to
send
them
as
a
successor
to
the
crown
one
of
those
princes
whom
according
to
custom
baal
had
not
long
previously
given
over
as
hostages
for
a
guarantee
of
his
loyalty
and
for
this
purpose
selected
from
their
number
who
was
probably
a
son
of
ithobaal
when
at
the
end
of
four
years
the
death
of
left
the
throne
vacant
the
tyrians
petitioned
for
his
brother
hirôm
and
nabonidus
who
was
then
engaged
in
syria
came
south
as
far
as
phoenicia
and
installed
the
prince
the
fragment
of
menander
does
not
give
the
babylonian
name
but
a
simple
chronological
calculation
proves
him
to
have
been
of
where
mention
is
made
of
a
certain
but
the
reading
of
the
name
is
uncertain
who
seems
to
be
in
revolt
against
the
chaldæans
floigl
has
very
ingeniously
harmonised
the
dates
of
the
annals
with
those
obtained
from
the
fragment
of
menander
and
has
thence
concluded
that
the
object
of
the
expedition
of
the
third
year
was
the
enthroning
of
hirôm
which
is
mentioned
in
the
fragment
and
during
whose
fourteenth
year
cyrus
became
king
of
babylon
this
took
place
at
the
very
moment
when
cyrus
was
preparing
his
expedition
against
astyages
and
the
babylonian
monarch
took
advantage
of
the
agitation
into
which
the
medes
were
thrown
by
this
invasion
to
carry
into
execution
a
project
which
he
had
been
planning
ever
since
his
accession
shortly
after
that
event
he
had
had
a
dream
in
which
marduk
the
great
lord
and
sin
the
light
of
heaven
and
earth
had
appeared
on
either
side
of
his
couch
the
former
addressing
him
in
the
following
words
king
of
babylon
with
the
horses
of
thy
chariot
bring
brick
rebuild
the
temple
of
harrân
that
sin
the
great
lord
may
take
up
his
abode
nabonidus
had
respectfully
pointed
out
that
the
town
was
in
the
hands
of
the
scythians
who
were
subjects
of
the
medes
but
the
god
had
replied
scythian
of
whom
thou
speakest
he
his
country
and
the
kings
his
protectors
are
no
cyrus
was
the
instrument
of
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecy
nabonidus
took
possession
of
harrân
without
difficulty
and
immediately
put
the
necessary
work
in
hand
this
was
indeed
the
sole
benefit
that
he
derived
from
the
changes
which
were
taking
place
and
it
is
probable
that
his
inaction
was
the
result
of
the
enfeebled
condition
of
the
empire
the
country
over
which
he
ruled
exhausted
by
the
assyrian
conquest
and
depopulated
by
the
scythian
invasions
had
not
had
time
to
recover
its
forces
since
it
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
chaldæans
and
the
wars
which
nebuchadrezzar
had
been
obliged
to
undertake
for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
his
own
power
though
few
in
number
and
not
fraught
with
danger
had
tended
to
prolong
the
state
of
weakness
into
which
it
had
sunk
if
the
hero
of
the
dynasty
who
had
conquered
egypt
had
not
ventured
to
measure
his
strength
with
the
median
princes
and
if
he
had
courted
the
friendship
not
only
of
the
warlike
cyaxares
but
of
the
effeminate
astyages
it
would
not
be
prudent
for
nabonidus
to
come
into
collision
with
the
victorious
from
the
heart
of
iran
chaldsea
doubtless
was
right
in
avoiding
hostilities
at
all
events
so
long
as
she
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
them
alone
but
other
nations
had
not
the
same
motives
for
exercising
prudence
and
lydia
was
fully
assured
that
the
moment
had
come
for
her
to
again
take
up
the
ambitious
designs
which
the
treaty
of
had
forced
her
to
renounce
alyattes
relieved
from
anxiety
with
regard
to
the
medes
had
confined
his
energies
to
establishing
firmly
his
kingdom
in
the
regions
of
asia
minor
extending
westwards
from
the
halys
and
the
the
acquisition
of
colophon
the
destruction
of
smyrna
the
alliance
with
the
towns
of
the
littoral
had
ensured
him
undisputed
possession
of
the
valleys
of
the
caicus
and
the
hermus
but
the
plains
of
the
maeander
in
the
south
and
the
mountainous
districts
of
mysia
in
the
north
were
not
yet
fully
brought
under
his
sway
he
completed
the
occupation
of
the
troad
and
mysia
about
and
afterwards
made
of
the
entire
province
an
appanage
for
adramyttios
who
was
either
his
son
or
his
brother
the
doings
of
alyattes
in
troas
and
in
mysia
are
vouched
for
by
the
anecdote
related
by
plutarch
concerning
this
relations
with
pittakos
the
founding
of
adramyttium
is
attributed
to
him
by
stephen
of
byzantium
after
aristotle
who
made
adramyttios
the
brother
of
croesus
radat
gives
good
reasons
for
believing
that
adramyttios
was
brother
to
alyattes
and
uncle
to
crosus
and
the
same
person
as
adramys
the
son
of
sadyattes
according
to
xanthus
of
lydia
radet
gives
the
year
for
the
date
of
these
events
he
even
carried
his
arms
into
bithynia
where
to
enforce
his
rule
he
built
several
strongholds
one
of
which
called
alyatta
commanded
the
main
road
leading
from
the
basin
of
the
rhyndacus
to
that
of
the
sangarius
skirting
the
spurs
of
olympus
he
experienced
some
difficulty
in
reducing
caria
and
did
not
finally
succeed
in
his
efforts
till
nearly
the
close
of
his
reign
in
adramyttios
was
then
dead
and
his
fief
had
devolved
on
his
eldest
surviving
brother

lower
quarters
and
concentrated
all
his
forces
on
the
defence
of
the
citadel
he
refused
to
open
negotiations
until
after
the
fall
of
a
tower
at
the
moment
when
a
practicable
breach
had
been
made
and
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
honourable
capitulation
for
himself
and
his
people
by
a
ruse
the
history
of
sadyattes
and
of
his
part
in
the
conspiracy
results
from
points
of
agreement
which
have
been
established
between
various
passages
in
herodotus
and
in
nicolas
of
damascus
where
the
person
is
sometimes
named
and
sometimes
not
he
dedicated
the
town
to
artemis
and
by
means
of
a
rope
connected
the
city
walls
with
the
temple
which
stood
nearly
a
mile
away
in
the
suburbs
and
then
entreated
for
peace
in
the
name
of
the
goddess
croesus
was
amused
at
the
artifice
and
granted
favourable
conditions
to
the
inhabitants
but
insisted
on
the
expulsion
of
the
tyrant
the
latter
bowed
before
the
decree
and
confiding
the
care
of
his
children
and
possessions
to
his
friend
pasicles
left
for
the
peloponnesus
with
his
retinue
bphesus
up
to
this
time
had
been
a
kind
of
allied
principality
whose
chiefs
united
to
the
royal
family
of
lydia
by
marriages
from
generation
to
generation
recognised
the
nominal
suzerainty
of
the
reigning
king
rather
than
his
effective
authority
it
was
in
fact
a
species
of
protectorate
which
while
furthering
the
commercial
interests
of
lydia
satisfied
at
the
same
time
the
passion
of
the
greek
cities
for
autonomy
croesus
encouraged
by
his
first
success
could
not
rest
contented
with
such
a
compromise
he
attacked
successively
miletus
and
the
various
ionian
æolian
and
dorian
communities
of
the
littoral
and
brought
them
all
under
his
sway
promising
on
their
capitulation
that
their
local
constitutions
should
be
respected
if
they
became
direct
dependencies
of
his
empire
he
placed
garrisons
in
such
towns
as
were
strategically
important
for
him
to
occupy
but
everywhere
else
he
razed
to
the
ground
the
fortresses
and
ramparts
which
might
afford
protection
to
his
enemies
in
case
of
rebellion
compelling
the
inhabitants
to
take
up
their
abode
on
the
open
plain
where
they
could
not
readily
defend
themselves
the
administration
of
the
affairs
of
each
city
was
entrusted
to
either
a
wealthy
citizen
or
an
hereditary
tyrant
or
an
elected
magistrate
who
was
held
responsible
for
its
loyalty
the
administrator
paid
over
the
tribute
to
the
treasurers
levied
the
specified
contingent
and
took
command
of
it
in
time
of
war
settled
any
quarrels
which
might
occur
and
was
empowered
when
necessary
to
exile
turbulent
and
ambitious
persons
whose
words
or
actions
appeared
to
him
to
be
suspicious
croesus
treated
with
generosity
those
republics
which
tendered
him
loyal
obedience
and
affected
a
special
devotion
to
their
gods
he
gave
a
large
number
of
offerings
to
the
sanctuary
of
in
the
territory
of
miletus
he
dedicated
some
golden
heifers
at
the
artemision
of
ephesus
and
erected
the
greater
number
of
the
columns
of
that
temple
at
his
own
expense
he
treated
thus
the
ephesians
and
the
ilians
the
fragments
of
columns
brought
from
this
temple
by
wood
and
preserved
in
the
british
museum
have
on
one
of
the
bases
the
remains
of
an
inscription
confirming
the
testimony
of
herodotus
at
one
time
in
his
career
he
appears
to
have
contemplated
extending
his
dominion
over
the
greek
islands
and
planned
as
was
said
the
equipment
of
a
fleet
but
he
soon
acknowledged
the
imprudence
of
such
a
project
and
confined
his
efforts
to
strengthening
his
advantageous
position
on
the
littoral
by
contracting
alliances
with
the
island
populations
and
with
the
nations
of
greece
proper
he
seems
to
have
been
deterred
from
his
project
by
a
sarcastic
remark
made
as
some
say
by
pittakos
the
mitylenian
or
according
to
others
by
bias
of
priênê
following
the
diplomacy
of
his
ancestors
he
began
by
devoting
himself
to
the
gods
of
the
country
and
took
every
pains
to
gain
the
good
graces
of
apollo
of
delphi
he
dispensed
his
gifts
with
such
liberality
that
neither
his
contemporaries
nor
subsequent
generations
grew
weary
of
admiring
it
on
one
occasion
he
is
said
to
have
sacrificed
three
thousand
animals
and
burnt
moreover
on
the
pyre
the
costly
contents
of
a
palace
couches
covered
with
silver
and
gold
coverlets
and
robes
of
purple
and
golden
vials
his
subjects
were
commanded
to
contribute
to
the
offering
and
he
caused
one
hundred
and
seventeen
hollow
to
be
cast
of
the
gold
which
they
brought
him
for
this
purpose
these
bricks
were
placed
in
regular
layers
within
the
treasury
at
delphi
where
the
gifts
of
lydia
from
the
time
of
alyattes
were
deposited
and
the
top
of
the
pile
was
surmounted
by
a
lion
of
fine
gold
of
such
a
size
that
the
pedestal
and
statue
together
were
worth
of
our
present
money
these
however
formed
only
a
tithe
of
his
gifts
many
of
the
objects
dedicated
by
him
were
dispersed
half
a
century
later
when
the
temple
was
burnt
and
found
their
way
into
the
treasuries
of
the
greek
states
which
enjoyed
the
favour
of
apollo
among
them
being
an
enormous
gold
cup
sent
to
clazomeme
and
four
barrels
of
silver
and
two
bowls
one
of
silver
and
one
of
gold
sent
to
the
corinthians
the
people
at
delphi
as
well
as
their
god
participated
in
the
royal
largesse
and
croesus
distributed
to
them
the
sum
of
two
staters
per
head
no
doubt
their
gratitude
led
them
by
degrees
to
exaggerate
the
total
of
the
benefits
showered
upon
them
especially
as
time
went
on
and
their
recollection
of
the
king
became
fainter
but
even
when
we
reduce
the
number
of
the
many
gifts
which
they
attributed
to
him
we
are
still
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
they
surpassed
anything
hitherto
recorded
and
that
they
produced
throughout
the
whole
of
greece
the
effect
that
croesus
had
desired
the
oracle
granted
to
him
and
to
the
lydians
the
rights
of
citizenship
in
perpetuity
the
privilege
of
priority
in
consulting
it
before
all
comers
precedence
for
his
legates
over
other
foreign
embassies
and
a
place
of
honour
at
the
games
and
at
all
religious
ceremonies
it
was
in
fact
the
admission
of
lydia
into
the
hellenic
concert
and
the
offerings
which
croesus
showered
upon
the
sanctuaries
of
lesser
fame
that
of
zeus
at
dodona
of
amphiaraos
at
oropos
of
trophonios
at
lebadsea
on
the
oracle
of
abee
in
phocis
and
on
the
ismenian
apollo
at
thebes
secured
a
general
approval
of
the
act
political
alliances
contracted
with
the
great
families
of
athens
the
alcmonidæ
and
eupatridæ
with
the
cypselidæ
of
corinth
and
with
the
heraclidæ
of
sparta
completed
the
policy
of
bribery
which
croesus
had
inaugurated
in
the
sacerdotal
republics
with
the
result
that
towards
being
in
the
position
of
uncontested
patron
of
the
greeks
of
asia
he
could
count
upon
the
sympathetic
neutrality
of
the
majority
of
their
compatriots
in
europe
and
on
the
effective
support
of
a
smaller
number
of
them
in
the
event
of
his
being
forced
into
hostilities
with
one
or
other
of
his
asiatic
rivals
traditions
as
to
relations
with
alcrnseon
are
preserved
by
herodotus
the
king
compelled
the
inhabitants
of
lampsacus
his
vassals
to
release
the
elder
miltiades
whom
they
had
taken
prisoner
and
thus
earned
the
gratitude
of
the
eupatridæ
alyattes
had
been
the
ally
of
periander
as
is
proved
by
an
anecdote
in
herodotus
this
friendship
continued
under
crosus
for
after
the
fall
of
the
monarchy
when
the
special
treasuries
of
lydia
were
suppressed
the
offerings
of
the
lydian
kings
were
deposited
in
the
treasury
of
corinth
according
to
theopompus
the
lacedaemonians
wishing
to
gild
the
face
of
the
statue
of
the
amyclsean
apollo
and
finding
no
gold
in
greece
consulted
the
delphian
prophetess
by
her
advice
they
sent
to
lydia
to
buy
the
precious
metal
from
croesus
this
however
constituted
merely
one
side
of
his
policy
and
the
negotiations
which
he
carried
on
with
his
western
neighbours
were
conducted
simultaneously
with
his
wars
against
those
of
the
east
alyattes
had
asserted
his
supremacy
over
the
whole
of
the
country
on
the
western
side
of
the
halys
but
it
was
of
a
very
vague
kind
having
no
definite
form
and
devoid
of
practical
results
as
far
as
several
of
the
districts
in
the
interior
were
concerned
croesus
made
it
a
reality
and
in
less
than
ten
years
all
the
peoples
contained
within
it
the
lycians
excepted
mysians
phrygians
mariandynians
paphlagonians
thynians
bithynians
and
pamphylians
had
rendered
him
homage
in
its
constitution
his
empire
in
no
way
differed
from
those
which
at
that
time
shared
the
rule
of
western
asia
the
number
of
districts
administered
directly
by
the
sovereign
were
inconsiderable
and
most
of
the
states
comprised
in
it
preserved
their
autonomy
phrygia
had
its
own
princes
who
were
descendants
of
midas
and
in
the
same
way
caria
and
mysia
also
retained
theirs
but
these
vassal
lords
paid
tribute
and
furnished
contingents
to
their
liege
of
sardes
and
garrisons
lodged
in
their
citadels
as
well
as
military
stations
or
towns
founded
in
strategic
positions
such
as
in
bithynia
cibyra
hyda
grimenothyræ
and
temenothyræ
kept
strict
watch
over
them
securing
the
while
free
circulation
for
caravans
or
individual
merchants
throughout
the
whole
country
croesus
had
achieved
his
conquest
just
as
media
was
tottering
to
its
fall
under
the
attacks
of
the
persians
this
is
proved
by
the
history
of
the
prince
adrastus
in
herodotus
herodotus
probably
alluded
to
this
colonisation
by
crcesus
when
he
said
that
the
mysians
of
olympus
were
descendants
of
lydian
colonists
strabo
merely
says
that
the
kibyrates
were
descended
from
the
lydians
who
dwelt
in
cabalia
since
croesus
was
as
far
as
we
know
the
only
lydian
king
who
ever
possessed
this
part
of
asia
radet
with
good
reason
concludes
that
kibyra
was
colonised
by
him
radet
has
given
good
reasons
for
believing
that
at
least
some
of
these
towns
were
enlarged
and
fortified
by
croesus
their
victory
placed
the
lydian
king
in
a
position
of
great
perplexity
since
it
annulled
the
treaties
concluded
after
the
eclipse
of
and
by
releasing
him
from
the
obligations
then
contracted
afforded
him
an
opportunity
of
extending
the
limits
within
which
his
father
had
confined
himself
now
or
never
was
the
time
for
crossing
the
halys
in
order
to
seize
those
mineral
districts
with
which
his
subjects
had
so
long
had
commercial
relations
on
the
other
hand
the
unexpected
energy
of
which
the
persians
had
just
given
proof
their
bravery
their
desire
for
conquest
and
the
valour
of
their
leader
all
tended
to
deter
him
from
the
project
should
he
be
victorious
cyrus
would
probably
not
rest
contented
with
tke
annexation
of
a
few
unimportant
districts
or
the
imposition
of
a
tribute
but
would
treat
his
adversary
as
he
had
astyages
and
having
dethroned
him
would
divide
lydia
into
departments
to
be
ruled
by
one
or
other
of
his
partisans
warlike
ideas
nevertheless
prevailed
at
the
court
of
sardes
and
taking
all
into
consideration
we
can
not
deny
that
they
had
reason
on
their
side
the
fall
of
ecbatana
had
sealed
the
fate
of
media
proper
and
its
immediate
dependencies
had
naturally
shared
the
fortunes
of
the
capital
but
the
more
distant
provinces
still
wavered
and
they
would
probably
attempt
to
take
advantage
of
the
change
of
rule
to
regain
their
liberty
cyrus
obliged
to
take
up
arms
against
them
would
no
longer
have
his
entire
forces
at
his
disposal
and
by
attacking
him
at
that
juncture
it
might
be
possible
to
check
his
power
before
it
became
irresistible
having
sketched
out
his
plan
of
campaign
croesus
prepared
to
execute
it
with
all
possible
celerity
egypt
and
chaldæa
like
himself
doubtless
felt
themselves
menaced
he
experienced
little
difficulty
in
persuading
them
to
act
in
concert
with
him
in
face
of
the
common
peril
and
he
obtained
from
both
amasis
and
nabonidus
promises
of
effective
at
the
same
time
he
had
recourse
to
the
greek
oracles
and
that
of
delphi
was
instrumental
in
obtaining
for
him
a
treaty
of
alliance
and
friendship
with
sparta
negotiations
had
been
carried
on
so
rapidly
that
by
the
end
of
all
was
in
readiness
for
a
simultaneous
movement
sparta
was
equipping
a
fleet
and
merely
awaited
the
return
of
the
favourable
season
to
embark
her
contingent
egypt
had
already
despatched
hers
and
her
cypriot
vassals
were
on
the
point
of
starting
while
bands
of
thracian
infantry
were
marching
to
reinforce
the
lydian
army
these
various
elements
represented
so
considerable
a
force
of
men
that
had
they
been
ranged
on
a
field
of
battle
cyrus
would
have
experienced
considerable
difficulty
in
overcoming
them
an
unforeseen
act
of
treachery
obliged
the
lydians
to
hasten
their
preparations
and
commence
hostilities
before
the
moment
agreed
on
eurybatos
an
ephesian
to
whom
the
king
had
entrusted
large
sums
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
raising
mercenaries
in
the
peloponnesus
fled
with
his
gold
into
persia
and
betrayed
the
secret
of
the
coalition
the
achaemenian
sovereign
did
not
hesitate
to
forestall
the
attack
and
promptly
assumed
the
offensive
the
transport
of
an
army
from
ecbatana
to
the
middle
course
of
the
halys
would
have
been
a
long
and
laborious
undertaking
even
had
it
kept
within
the
territory
of
the
empire
it
would
have
necessitated
crossing
the
mountain
groups
of
armenia
at
their
greatest
width
and
that
at
a
time
when
the
snow
was
still
lying
deep
upon
the
ground
and
the
torrents
were
swollen
and
unfordable
the
most
direct
route
which
passed
through
assyria
and
the
part
of
mesopotamia
south
of
the
masios
lay
for
the
most
part
in
the
hands
of
the
chaldæans
but
their
enfeebled
condition
justified
choice
of
it
and
he
resolved
in
the
event
of
their
resistance
to
cut
his
way
through
sword
in
hand
he
therefore
bore
down
upon
arbela
by
the
gorges
of
rowandîz
in
the
month
nisan
making
as
though
he
were
bound
for
karduniash
but
before
the
babylonians
had
time
to
recover
from
their
alarm
at
this
movement
he
crossed
the
river
not
far
from
nineveh
and
struck
into
mesopotamia
he
probably
skirted
the
slopes
of
the
masios
overcoming
and
killing
in
the
month
iyyâr
some
petty
king
probably
the
ruler
of
armenia
and
debouched
into
cappadocia
this
province
was
almost
entirely
in
the
power
of
the
enemy
nabonidus
had
despatched
couriers
by
the
shortest
route
in
order
to
warn
his
ally
and
if
necessary
to
claim
his
promised
help
ploigl
who
was
the
first
to
refer
a
certain
passage
in
the
of
to
the
expedition
against
croesus
restored
is
parda
as
the
name
of
the
country
mentioned
and
saw
even
the
capture
of
sardes
in
the
events
of
the
month
iyyâr
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
greek
tradition
the
connection
between
the
campaign
beyond
the
tigris
and
the
lydian
war
seems
to
me
incontestable
but
the
babylonian
chronicler
has
merely
recorded
the
events
which
affected
babylonia
object
was
both
to
intimidate
nabonidus
and
also
to
secure
possession
of
the
most
direct
and
at
the
same
time
the
easiest
route
by
cutting
across
mesopotamia
he
avoided
the
difficult
marches
in
the
mountainous
districts
of
armenia
perhaps
we
should
combine
with
the
information
of
the
the
passage
of
xenophon
where
it
is
said
that
the
armenians
refused
tribute
and
service
to
the
king
of
persia
cyrus
would
have
punished
the
rebels
on
his
way
after
crossing
the
euphrates
croesus
when
he
received
them
had
with
him
only
the
smaller
portion
of
his
army
the
lydian
cavalry
the
contingents
of
his
asiatic
subjects
and
a
few
greek
veterans
and
it
would
probably
have
been
wiser
to
defer
the
attack
till
after
the
disembarkation
of
the
lacedaemonians
but
hesitation
at
so
critical
a
moment
might
have
discouraged
his
followers
and
decided
his
fate
before
any
action
had
taken
place
he
therefore
collected
his
troops
together
fell
upon
the
right
bank
of
the
halys
devastated
the
country
occupied
pteria
and
the
neighbouring
towns
and
exiled
the
inhabitants
to
a
distance
he
had
just
completed
the
subjection
of
the
white
syrians
when
he
was
met
by
an
emissary
from
the
persians
cyrus
offered
him
his
life
and
confirmed
his
authority
on
condition
of
his
pleading
for
mercy
and
taking
the
oath
of
vassalage
croesus
sent
a
proud
refusal
which
was
followed
by
a
brilliant
victory
after
which
a
truce
of
three
months
was
concluded
between
the
belligerents
on
this
point
herodotus
tells
a
current
story
of
his
time
thaïes
had
a
trench
dug
behind
the
army
which
was
probably
encamped
in
one
of
the
bends
made
by
the
halys
he
then
diverted
the
stream
into
this
new
bed
with
the
result
that
the
lydians
found
themselves
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
without
having
had
the
trouble
of
crossing
it
nicolas
of
damascus
records
that
cyrus
after
the
capture
of
sardes
for
a
short
time
contemplated
making
croesus
a
vassal
king
or
at
least
a
satrap
of
lydia
we
have
two
very
different
accounts
of
this
campaign
viz
that
of
herodotus
and
that
of
polyonus
according
to
herodotus
croesus
gave
battle
only
once
in
pteria
with
indecisive
result
and
on
the
next
day
quietly
retired
to
his
kingdom
thinking
that
cyrus
would
not
dare
to
pursue
him
according
to
polyonus
croesus
victorious
in
a
first
engagement
owing
to
a
more
or
less
plausible
military
stratagem
consented
to
a
truce
but
on
the
day
after
was
completely
defeated
and
obliged
to
return
to
his
kingdom
with
a
routed
army
account
of
the
fall
of
croesus
and
of
sardes
borrowed
partly
from
a
good
written
source
xanthus
or
charon
of
lampsacus
partly
from
the
tradition
of
the
harpagidse
seems
to
have
for
its
object
the
soothing
of
the
vanity
both
of
the
persians
and
of
the
lydians
since
if
the
result
of
the
war
could
not
be
contested
the
issue
of
the
battle
was
at
least
left
uncertain
if
he
has
given
a
faithful
account
no
one
can
understand
why
croesus
should
have
retired
and
ceded
white
syria
to
a
rival
who
had
never
conquered
him
the
account
given
by
polysenus
in
spite
of
the
improbability
of
some
of
its
details
comes
from
a
author
the
defeat
of
the
lydians
in
the
second
battle
explains
the
retreat
of
crcesus
who
is
without
excuse
in
version
of
the
affair
pompeius
trogus
adopted
a
version
similar
to
that
of
polysenus
cyrus
employed
the
respite
in
attempting
to
win
over
the
greek
cities
of
the
littoral
which
he
pictured
to
himself
as
nursing
a
bitter
hatred
against
the
mermnadæ
but
it
is
to
be
doubted
if
his
emissaries
succeeded
even
in
wresting
a
declaration
of
neutrality
from
the
milesians
the
remainder
ionians
and
æolians
all
continued
faithful
to
their
oaths
on
the
resumption
of
hostilities
the
tide
of
fortune
turned
and
the
lydians
were
crushed
by
the
superior
forces
of
the
persians
and
the
medes
crcesus
retired
under
cover
of
night
burning
the
country
as
he
retreated
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
following
him
and
crossed
the
halys
with
the
remains
of
his
battalions
the
season
was
already
far
advanced
he
thought
that
the
persians
threatened
in
the
rear
by
the
babylonian
troops
would
shrink
from
the
prospect
of
a
winter
campaign
and
he
fell
back
upon
sardes
without
further
lingering
in
phrygia
but
nabonidus
did
not
feel
himself
called
upon
to
show
the
same
devotion
that
his
ally
had
evinced
towards
him
or
perhaps
the
priests
who
governed
in
his
name
did
not
permit
him
to
fulfil
his
engagements
herodotus
makes
the
attempted
corruption
of
the
ionians
to
date
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
even
before
cyrus
took
the
field
the
author
followed
by
pompeius
trogus
has
alone
preserved
the
record
of
this
treaty
the
fact
is
important
as
explaining
behaviour
after
his
defeat
but
schubert
goes
too
far
when
he
on
this
ground
an
actual
campaign
of
cyrus
against
babylon
radet
has
come
back
to
the
right
view
in
seeing
only
a
treaty
made
with
nabonidus
as
soon
as
peace
was
proposed
he
accepted
terms
without
once
considering
the
danger
to
which
the
lydians
were
exposed
by
his
defection
the
persian
king
raised
his
camp
as
soon
as
all
fear
of
an
attack
to
rearward
was
removed
and
falling
upon
defenceless
phrygia
pushed
forward
to
sardes
in
spite
of
the
inclemency
of
the
season
no
movement
could
have
been
better
planned
or
have
produced
such
startling
results
croesus
had
disbanded
the
greater
part
of
his
feudal
contingents
and
had
kept
only
his
about
him
the
remainder
of
his
army
natives
mercenaries
and
allies
having
received
orders
not
to
reassemble
till
the
following
spring
the
king
hastily
called
together
all
his
available
troops
both
lydians
and
foreigners
and
confronted
his
enemies
for
the
second
time
even
under
these
unfavourable
conditions
he
hoped
to
gain
the
advantage
had
his
cavalry
the
finest
in
the
world
been
able
to
take
part
in
the
engagement
but
cyrus
had
placed
in
front
of
his
lines
a
detachment
of
camels
and
the
smell
of
these
animals
so
frightened
the
lydian
horses
that
they
snorted
and
refused
to
charge
mention
of
the
use
of
camels
is
confirmed
with
various
readings
by
xenophon
by
polysenus
and
by
ælian
their
employment
does
not
necessarily
belong
to
a
legendary
form
of
the
story
especially
if
we
suppose
that
the
camel
unknown
before
in
asia
minor
was
first
introduced
there
by
the
persian
army
the
site
of
the
battle
is
not
precisely
known
according
to
herodotus
the
fight
took
place
in
the
great
plain
before
sardes
which
is
crossed
by
several
small
tributaries
of
the
hermus
amongst
others
the
hyllus
radet
recognises
that
the
hyllus
of
herodotus
is
the
whole
or
part
of
the
stream
now
called
the
and
he
places
the
scene
of
action
near
the
township
of
adala
which
would
correspond
with
thymbrara
this
continues
to
be
the
most
likely
hypothesis
after
the
battle
croesus
would
have
fled
along
the
hermus
towards
sardes
story
is
a
pure
romance
croesus
was
again
worsted
on
the
confines
of
the
plain
of
the
hermus
and
taking
refuge
in
the
citadel
of
sardes
he
despatched
couriers
to
his
allies
in
greece
and
egypt
to
beg
for
succour
without
delay
the
lacedaemonians
hurried
on
the
mobilisation
of
their
troops
and
their
vessels
were
on
the
point
of
weighing
anchor
when
the
news
arrived
that
sardes
had
fallen
in
the
early
days
of
december
and
that
croesus
himself
was
a
prisoner
how
the
town
came
to
be
taken
the
greeks
themselves
never
knew
and
their
chroniclers
have
given
several
different
accounts
of
the
event
radet
gives
the
date
of
the
capture
of
sardes
as
about
november
but
the
number
and
importance
of
the
events
occurring
between
the
retreat
of
croesus
and
the
decisive
catastrophe
the
negotiations
with
babylon
the
settling
into
winter
quarters
the
march
of
cyrus
across
phrygia
must
have
required
a
longer
time
than
radet
allots
to
them
in
his
hypothesis
and
i
make
the
date
a
month
later
ctesias
and
xenophon
seem
to
depend
on
herodotus
the
former
with
additional
fabulous
details
concerning
his
oebaras
counsellor
which
show
the
probable
origin
of
his
additions
polysenus
had
at
his
disposal
a
different
story
the
same
probably
that
he
used
for
his
account
of
the
campaign
in
cappadocia
for
in
it
can
be
recognised
the
wish
to
satisfy
within
possible
limits
the
pride
of
the
lydians
here
again
the
decisive
success
is
preceded
by
a
check
given
to
cyrus
and
a
three
truce
the
least
improbable
is
that
found
in
herodotus
the
blockade
had
lasted
so
he
tells
us
fourteen
days
when
cyrus
announced
that
he
would
richly
reward
the
first
man
to
scale
the
walls
many
were
tempted
by
his
promises
but
were
unsuccessful
in
their
efforts
and
their
failure
had
discouraged
all
further
attempts
when
a
mardian
soldier
named
hyreades
on
duty
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
slopes
overlooking
the
tmolus
saw
a
lydian
descend
from
rock
to
rock
in
search
of
his
helmet
which
he
had
lost
and
regain
the
city
by
the
same
way
without
any
great
difficulty
he
noted
carefully
the
exact
spot
and
in
company
with
a
few
comrades
climbed
up
till
he
reached
the
ramparts
others
followed
and
taking
the
besieged
unawares
they
opened
the
gates
to
the
main
body
of
the
army
about
three
and
a
half
centuries
later
sardes
was
captured
in
the
same
way
by
one
of
the
generals
of
antiochus
the
great
croesus
could
not
bear
to
survive
the
downfall
of
his
kingdom
he
erected
a
funeral
pyre
in
the
courtyard
of
his
palace
and
took
up
his
position
on
it
together
with
his
wives
his
daughters
and
the
noblest
youths
of
his
court
surrounded
by
his
most
precious
possessions
he
could
cite
the
example
of
more
than
one
vanquished
monarch
of
the
ancient
asiatic
world
in
choosing
such
an
end
and
one
of
the
fabulous
ancestors
of
his
race
had
perished
after
this
fashion
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
was
the
sacrifice
carried
out
everything
leads
us
to
believe
that
it
was
but
popular
feeling
could
not
be
resigned
to
the
idea
that
a
prince
who
had
shown
such
liberality
towards
the
gods
in
his
prosperity
should
be
abandoned
by
them
in
the
time
of
his
direst
need
they
came
to
believe
that
the
lydian
monarch
had
expiated
by
his
own
defeat
the
crime
by
the
help
of
which
his
ancestor
gyges
had
usurped
the
throne
apollo
had
endeavoured
to
delay
the
punishment
till
the
next
generation
that
it
might
fall
on
the
son
of
his
votary
but
he
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
fate
a
respite
of
three
years
only
even
then
he
had
not
despaired
and
had
warned
croesus
by
the
voice
of
the
oracles
they
had
foretold
him
that
in
crossing
the
halys
the
lydians
destroy
a
great
empire
and
that
their
power
would
last
till
the
day
when
a
mule
should
sit
upon
the
throne
of
media
croesus
blinded
by
fate
could
not
see
that
cyrus
who
was
of
mixed
race
persian
by
his
father
and
median
by
his
mother
was
the
predicted
mule
he
therefore
crossed
the
halys
and
a
great
empire
fell
but
it
was
his
own
at
all
events
the
god
might
have
desired
to
show
that
to
honour
his
altars
and
adorn
his
temple
was
in
itself
after
all
the
best
of
treasures
sardes
suffering
the
vengeance
of
zeus
was
conquered
by
the
army
of
the
persians
the
god
of
the
golden
sword
apollo
was
the
guardian
of
croesus
when
the
day
of
despair
arrived
the
king
could
not
resign
himself
to
tears
and
servitude
within
the
court
he
erected
a
funeral
pyre
on
which
together
with
his
chaste
spouse
and
his
bitterly
lamenting
daughters
of
beautiful
locks
he
mounted
he
raised
his
hands
towards
the
depths
of
the
ether
and
cried
fate
where
is
the
gratitude
of
the
gods
where
is
the
prince
the
child
of
leto
where
is
now
the
house
of
alyattes
the
ancient
citadel
of
sardes
has
fallen
the
pactolus
of
golden
waves
runs
red
with
blood
ignominiously
are
the
women
driven
from
their
chambers
that
which
was
once
my
hated
foe
is
now
my
friend
and
the
sweetest
thing
is
to
die
thus
he
spoke
and
ordered
the
softly
moving
to
set
fire
to
the
wooden
structure
the
word
translated
moving
is
here
perhaps
a
proper
name
the
slave
whose
duty
it
was
to
kindle
the
pyre
was
called
abrobatas
in
the
version
of
the
story
chosen
by
bacchylides
while
that
adopted
by
the
potter
whose
work
is
reproduced
on
the
opposite
page
calls
him
euthymos
the
maidens
shrieked
and
threw
their
arms
around
their
mother
for
the
death
before
them
was
that
most
hated
by
mortals
but
just
when
the
sparkling
fury
of
the
cruel
fire
had
spread
around
zeus
calling
up
a
cloud
extinguished
the
yellow
flame
nothing
is
incredible
of
that
which
the
will
of
the
gods
has
decreed
apollo
of
delos
seizing
the
old
man
bore
him
together
with
his
daughters
of
tender
feet
into
the
hyperborean
land
as
a
reward
for
his
piety
for
no
mortal
had
sent
richer
offerings
to
the
illustrious
pythô
illustration
cimesus
on
his
pyre
drawn
by
from
a
photograph
of
the
original
in
the
museum
of
the
louvre
this
miraculous
ending
delighted
the
poets
and
inspired
many
fine
lines
but
history
could
with
difficulty
accommodate
itself
to
such
a
materialistic
intervention
of
a
divine
being
and
sought
a
less
fabulous
solution
the
legend
which
appeared
most
probable
to
the
worthy
herodotus
did
not
even
admit
that
the
lydian
king
took
his
own
life
it
was
cyrus
who
condemned
him
either
with
a
view
of
devoting
the
of
his
victory
to
the
immortals
or
to
test
whether
the
immortals
would
save
the
rival
whose
piety
had
been
so
frequently
held
up
to
his
admiration
the
edges
of
the
pyre
had
already
taken
light
when
the
lydian
king
sighed
and
thrice
repeated
the
name
of
solon
it
was
a
tardy
recollection
of
a
conversation
in
which
the
athenian
sage
had
stated
without
being
believed
that
none
can
be
accounted
truly
happy
while
they
still
live
cyrus
applying
it
to
himself
was
seized
with
remorse
or
pity
and
commanded
the
bystanders
to
quench
the
fire
but
their
efforts
were
in
vain
thereupon
croesus
implored
the
pity
of
apollo
and
suddenly
the
sky
which
up
till
then
had
been
serene
and
clear
became
overcast
thick
clouds
collected
and
rain
fell
so
heavily
that
the
burning
pile
was
at
once
extinguished
the
story
told
by
nicolas
of
damascus
comes
down
probably
from
xanthus
of
lydia
but
with
many
additions
borrowed
directly
from
herodotus
and
rhetorical
developments
by
the
author
himself
most
other
writers
who
tell
the
story
depend
for
their
information
either
directly
or
indirectly
on
herodotus
in
later
times
it
was
supposed
that
the
lydian
king
was
preserved
from
the
flames
by
the
use
of
some
talisman
such
as
the
ephesian
letters
well
treated
by
his
conqueror
the
lydian
king
is
said
to
have
become
his
friend
and
most
loyal
counsellor
he
accepted
from
him
the
fief
of
barênê
in
media
often
accompanied
him
in
his
campaigns
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
was
of
great
service
to
him
by
the
wise
advice
which
he
gave
we
may
well
ask
what
would
have
taken
place
had
he
gained
the
decisive
victory
over
cyrus
that
he
hoped
chaldæa
possessed
merely
the
semblance
of
her
former
greatness
and
power
and
if
she
still
maintained
her
hold
over
mesopotamia
syria
phoenicia
and
parts
of
arabia
it
was
because
these
provinces
impoverished
by
the
assyrian
conquest
and
entirely
laid
waste
by
the
scythians
had
lost
the
most
energetic
elements
of
their
populations
and
felt
themselves
too
much
enfeebled
to
rise
against
their
suzerain
egypt
like
chaldæa
was
in
a
state
of
decadence
and
even
though
her
pharaohs
attempted
to
compensate
for
the
inferiority
of
their
native
troops
by
employing
foreign
mercenaries
their
attempts
at
asiatic
rule
always
issued
in
defeat
and
just
as
the
babylonian
sovereigns
were
unable
to
reduce
them
to
servitude
so
they
on
their
part
were
powerless
to
gain
an
advantage
over
the
sovereigns
of
babylon
hence
lydia
in
her
youth
and
vigour
would
have
found
little
difficulty
in
gaining
the
ascendency
over
her
two
recent
allies
but
beyond
that
she
could
not
hope
to
push
her
success
her
restricted
territory
sparse
population
and
outlying
position
would
always
have
debarred
her
from
exercising
any
durable
dominion
over
them
and
though
absolute
mistress
of
asia
minor
the
countries
beyond
the
taurus
were
always
destined
to
elude
her
grasp
if
the
achæmenian
therefore
had
confined
himself
at
all
events
for
the
time
being
to
the
ancient
limits
of
his
kingdom
egypt
and
chaldæa
would
have
continued
to
vegetate
each
within
their
respective
area
and
the
triumph
of
croesus
would
on
the
whole
have
caused
but
little
change
in
the
actual
balance
of
power
in
the
east
the
downfall
of
croesus
on
the
contrary
marked
a
decisive
era
in
the
history
his
army
was
the
only
one
from
the
point
of
numbers
and
organisation
which
was
a
match
for
that
of
cyrus
and
from
the
day
of
its
dispersion
it
was
evident
that
neither
egypt
nor
chaldæa
had
any
chance
of
victory
on
the
the
subjection
of
babylon
and
harrân
of
hamath
damascus
tyre
and
sidon
of
memphis
and
thebes
now
became
merely
a
question
of
time
and
that
not
far
distant
the
whole
of
asia
and
that
part
of
africa
which
had
been
the
oldest
cradle
of
human
civilisation
were
now
to
pass
into
the
hands
of
one
man
and
form
a
single
empire
for
the
benefit
of
the
new
race
which
was
issuing
forth
in
irresistible
strength
from
the
recesses
of
the
iranian
it
was
destined
from
the
very
outset
to
come
into
conflict
with
an
older
but
no
less
vigorous
race
than
itself
that
of
the
greeks
whose
colonists
after
having
swarmed
along
the
coasts
of
the
mediterranean
were
now
beginning
to
quit
the
seaboard
and
penetrate
wherever
they
could
into
the
interior

had
been
on
friendly
terms
with
that
dynasty
of
the
meramadæ
who
had
shown
reverence
for
the
hellenic
gods
they
had
as
a
whole
disdained
to
betray
croesus
or
to
turn
upon
him
when
he
was
in
difficulties
beyond
the
halys
and
now
that
he
had
succumbed
to
his
fate
they
considered
that
the
ties
which
had
bound
them
to
sardes
were
broken
and
they
were
determined
to
preserve
their
independence
at
all
costs
this
spirit
of
insubordination
would
have
to
be
promptly
dealt
with
and
tightly
curbed
if
perpetual
troubles
in
the
future
were
to
be
avoided
the

was
now
brought

rising
power
and

kings
were
henceforward
obedient
to
the
persian
rule
none
of
the
documents
actually
say
this
but
the
general
tenor
of
account
seems
to
show
clearly
that
with
the
exception
of
the
greek
cities
of
the
carians
and
lycians
all
the
peoples
who
had
formed
part
of
the

dominion
under

submitted
without

resistance

taking

herodotus

a
second
syennesis
king
of
cilicia
forty
years
later
at
the
time
of
the
ionian
revolt
the
two
leagues
of
the
ionians
and
æolians
had
at
first
offered
to
recognise
cyrus
as
their
suzerain
under
the
same
conditions
as
those
with
which
croesus
had
been
satisfied
but
he
had
consented
to
accept
it
only
in
the
case
of
miletus
and
had
demanded
from
the
rest
an
unconditional
surrender
this
they
had
refused
and
uniting
in
a
common
cause
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
their
existence
they
had
resolved
to
take
up
arms
as
the
persians
possessed
no
fleet
the
creeks
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
side
of
the
ægean
and
the
severity
of
the
winter
prevented
any
attack
being
made
from
the
land
side
till
the
following
spring
they
meanwhile
sought
the
aid
of
their
and
despatched
an
embassy
to
the
spartans
the
latter
did
not
consider
it
prudent
to
lend
them
troops
as
they
would
have
done
in
the
case
of
croesus
but
they
authorised
lakrines
one
of
their
principal
citizens
to
demand
of
the
great
king
that
he
should
respect
the
hellenic
cities
under
pain
of
incurring
their
enmity

regions
of

babylon
had
not
ventured
upon
any
move
after
having
learned
the
news
of
the
fall
of
sardes
but
the
bactrians
and
the
sakæ
had
been
in
open
revolt
during
the
whole
of
the
year
that
he
had
been
detained
in
the
extreme
west
and
a
still
longer
absence
might
risk
the
loss
of
his
prestige
in
media
and
even
in
persia
itself
the
tradition
followed
by
ctesias
maintained
that
the
submission
of
the
eastern
peoples
was
an
accomplished
fact
when
the
lydian
war
began

adopted
by
herodotus

after

showed
that
fear
of
the
bactrians
and
the
sakæ
as

as
of
the
babylonians
and
egyptians
was
the
cause
that
hastened

the
threat
of
the
lacedaæmonians
had
little
effect
upon
him
he
inquired
as
to
what
sparta
and

were
and
having
been
informed
he
ironically
begged
the
lacedæmonian
envoy
to
thank
his

the
good
advice
with
which
they
had
honoured

had
embraced
his

to

the
place
capitulated
the
entire
conquest

cyrus

the
inhabitants
of
the
island
attempted
to
sell
him
to
the
enemy
for
a
large
sum
of
money
the
kymæans
saved
him
a
second
time
and
conveyed
him
to
the
temple
of
athene
poliarchos
at
chios
the
citizens
however
dragged
him
from
his
retreat
and
delivered
him

were
soon

to
order

mazares
was
able
to
devote
his
entire
energies
to
the
reduction
of
the
greek
cities

had
accomplished
merely
the
sack
of

the
devastation
of

he
died

of

up
in
a
few
words
the
account
given
by
herodotus
of
the
adventures
of
paktyas
but
without
mentioning
the
treachery
of
the
islanders
he
confines
himself
to
saying
cyrus
caught
the
fugitive
after
the
latter
had
successively
left

and

attributes
the
taking
of
this
city
to
the

the
tabalos
of

tradition
assigns
so
curious
a

him
as
governor
of
the
ancient
lydian
kingdom
and
completed
the
work
which
he
had
begun
the
first
two
places
to
be
besieged
were
phocæa
and
teos
but
their
inhabitants
preferred
exile
to
slavery
the
phocæans
sailed
away
to
found
marseilles
in
the
western
regions
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
people
of
teos
settled
along
the
coast
of
thracia
near
to
the
of
the
pangseus
and
there
built
abdera
on
the

of
an
ancient
clazomenian
colony
the
other
greek
towns
were
either
taken
by
assault
or
voluntarily
opened
their
gates
so
that
ere
long
both
ionians
and
æolians
were
with
the
exception
of
the
samians
under
persian
rule
the
very
position
of
the
latter
rendered
them
safe
from
attack
without
a
fleet
they
could
not
be
approached
and
the
only
people
who
could
have
furnished
cyrus
with
vessels
were
the
phoenicians
who
were
not
as
yet
under
his
power
the
rebellion
having
been
suppressed
in
this
quarter
harpagus
made
a
descent
into
caria
the
natives
hastened
to
place
themselves
under
the
persian
yoke
and
the
dorian
colonies
scattered
along
the
coast
cnidos

rendered
it

the

issued

victory
with
the
invaders
for

considerable
time
at
length
their
defeat
and
the
capitulation
of
their
town
induced
the
remainder
of
the
lycians
to
lay
down
arms
and
brought
about
the
final
pacification
of
the
peninsula
it
was
parcelled
out
into
several
governorships
according
to
its
ethnographical
affinities

the
governorship
of

that
of
ionia
that
of

names
are

harpàgus
appeared
to
have
resided
at
sardes
and
exercised
functions
over
the
various
districts
but
he
obtained
from
the
king
an
extensive
property
in
lycia
and
in
caria
which
subsequently
caused
these
two
provinces
to
be
regarded
as
an
appanage
of
his
family

calls
a
certain
mitrobates
satrap
of
daskylion
he
had
perhaps
been
already
given
this
office
by
cyrus
orcetes
had
been
made
governor
of
ionia
and
lydia
by
cyrus
while
thus
consolidating
his
first
conquest
cyrus
penetrated
into
the
unknown
regions
of
the
far
east
nothing
would
have
been
easier
for
him
than
to
have
fallen
upon
babylon
and
overthrown
as
it
were
by
the
way
the
decadent
rule
of
nabonidus
but
the
formidable
aspect
which
the
empire
still
presented
in
spite
of
its
enfeebled
condition
must
have
deceived
him
and
he
was
unwilling
to
come
into
conflict
with
it
until
he
had
made
a
final
reckoning
with
the
restless
and
unsettled
peoples
between
the
caspian
and
the
slopes
on
the
indian
side
of
the
of
iran
as
far
as
we
are
able
to
judge
they
were
for
the
most
part
of
iranian
extraction
and
had
the
same
religion
institutions
and
customs
as
the
medes
and
persians
tradition
had
already
referred
the
origin
of
zoroaster
and
the
scene
of
his
preaching
to
bactriana
that
land
of
heroes
whose
exploits
formed
the
theme
of
persian
epic
song
it
is
not
known
as
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
remark
by
what
ties
it
was
bound
to
the
empire
of
cyaxares
nor
indeed
if
it
ever
had
been
actually
attached
to
it
we
do
not
possess
unfortunately
more
than
almost
worthless
scraps
of
information
on
this
part
of
the
reign
of
cyrus
perhaps
the
most
important
period
of
it
since
then
for
the
first
time
peoples
who
had
been
hitherto
strangers
to
the
asiatic
world
were
brought
within
its
influence
if
ctesias
is
to
be
credited
bactriana
was
one
of
the
first
districts
to
be
conquered
its
inhabitants
were
regarded
as
being
among
the
bravest
of
the
east
and
furnished
the
best
soldiers
they
at
first
obtained
some
successes
but
laid
down
arms
on
hearing
that
cyrus
had
married
a
daughter
of
astyages
this
tradition
was
prevalent
at
a
time
when
the
achaemenians
were
putting
forward
the
theory
that
they
and
cyrus
before
them
were
the
legitimate
successors
of
the
old
median
sovereigns
they
welcomed
every
legend
which
tended
to
justify
their
pretensions
and
this
particular
one
was
certain
to
please
them
since
it
attributed
the
submission
of
bactriana
not
to
a
mere
display
of
brute
force
but
to
the
recognition
of
an
hereditary
right
the
annexation
of
this
province
entailed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
of
margiana
of
the
khoramnians
and
of
sogdiana
cyrus
constructed
fortresses
in
all
these
districts
the
most
celebrated
being
that
of
kyropolis
which
commanded
one
of
the
principal
fords
of
the
iaxartes
this
is
the
campaign
which
ctesias
places
before
the
lydian
war
but
which
herodotus
relegates
to
a
date
after
the
capture
of
sardes
ctesias
must
have
spoken
of
the
submission
of
these
peoples
for
a
few
words
of
a
description
which
he
gave
of
the
khoramnians
have
been
preserved
to
us
tomaschek
identifies
kyra
or
kyropolis
with
the
present
but
distinguishes
it
from
the
kyreskhata
of
ptolemy
to
which
he
assigns
a
site
near
usgent
the
steppes
of
siberia
arrested
his
course
on
the
north
but
to
the
east
in
the
mountains
of
chinese
turkestan
the
sakas
who
were
renowned
for
their
wealth
and
bravery
did
not
escape
his
ambitious
designs
the
account
which
has
come
down
to
us
of
his
campaigns
against
them
is
a
mere
romance
of
love
and
adventure
in
which
real
history
plays
a
very
small
part
he
is
said
to
have
attacked
and
defeated
them
at
the
first
onset
taking
their
king
amorges
prisoner
but
this
capture
which
cyrus
considered
a
decisive
advantage
was
supposed
to
have
turned
the
tide
of
fortune
against
him
sparêthra
the
wife
of
amorges
rallied
the
fugitives
round
her
defeated
the
invaders
in
several
engagements
and
took
so
many
of
their
men
captive
that
they
were
glad
to
restore
her
husband
to
her
in
exchange
for
the
prisoners
she
had
made
the
struggle
finally
ended
however
in
the
subjection
of
the
sakae
they
engaged
to
pay
tribute
and
thenceforward
constituted
the
of
the
iranians
against
the
nomads
of
the
east
cyrus
before
quitting
their
neighbourhood
again
ascended
the
and
reduced
ariana
thatagus
harauvati
zaranka
and
the
country
of
cabul
and
we
may
well
ask
if
he
found
leisure
to
turn
southwards
beyond
lake
hamun
and
reach
the
shores
of
the
indian
ocean
one
tradition
of
little
weight
relates
that
like
alexander
at
a
later
date
he
lost
his
army
in
the
arid
deserts
of
gedrosia
the
one
fact
that
remains
is
that
the
conquest
of
gedrosia
was
achieved
but
the
details
of
it
are
lost
the
period
covered
by
his
campaigns
was
from
five
to
six
years
from
to
but
cyrus
returned
from
these
expeditions
into
the
unknown
only
to
plan
fresh
undertakings
there
remained
nothing
now
to
hinder
him
from
marching
against
the
chaldæans
and
the
discord
prevailing
at
babylon
added
to
his
chance
of
success
passion
for
archæology
had
in
no
way
lessened
since
the
opening
of
his
reign
the
temple
restorations
prompted
by
it
absorbed
the
bulk
of
his
revenues
he
made
excavations
in
the
of
the
most
ancient
sanctuaries
such
as
larsam
uruk
uru
sippar
and
nipur
and
when
his
digging
was
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
cylinders
placed
there
by
his
predecessors
his
delight
knew
no
bounds
such
finds
constituted
the
great
events
of
his
life
in
comparison
with
which
the
political
revolutions
of
asia
and
africa
diminished
in
importance
day
by
day
it
is
difficult
to
tell
whether
this
indifference
to
the
weighty
affairs
of
government
was
as
complete
as
it
appears
to
us
at
this
distance
of
time
certain
facts
recorded
in
the
official
chronicles
of
that
date
go
to
prove
that
except
in
name
and
external
pomp
the
king
was
a
nonentity
the
real
power
lay
in
the
hands
of
the
nobles
and
generals
and
the
son
directed
affairs
for
them
in

in
a
state
of
inactivity
at
his
palace
of
tima

it
is
possible
that
his
condition
may
have
really
been
that
of
a
prisoner
for
he
never
left
tima
to
go
to
babylon
even
on
the
days
of
great
festivals
and
his
absence
prevented
the
celebration
of
the
higher
rites
of
the
national
religion
with
the
procession
of
bel
and
its
accompanying
ceremonies
for
several
consecutive
years
the
people
suffered
from
these
quarrels
in
high
places
not
only
the
native
babylonians
or
kaldâ
who
were
thus
deprived
of
their
accustomed
spectacles

piety
was
scandalised
by
these
dissensions

also

widely
scattered

too
weak

make
an
open
declaration
of
their
independence

hopes

their
apprehensions

raised
by
the
various
reports

hostilities

reached
their

the

the
number
of
the
jewish
exiles
which
perhaps
at

had
not

had
largely
increased
in
the
of
their
captivity

even
if
numerically
they
were
of
no

them
to
be

this
was
true
of
the
priests
and
scribes
only
a
blank
had
been
made
in
their
existence
from
the
moment
when
the
conqueror
had
dragged
them
from
the
routine
of
daily
rites
which
their
duties
in
the
temple
service
entailed
upon
them
the
hours
which
had
been
formerly
devoted
to
their
offices
were
now
expended
in
bewailing
the
misfortunes
of
their
nation
in
accusing
themselves
and
others
and
in
demanding
what
crime
had
merited
this
punishment
and
why
jahveh
who
had
so
often
shown
clemency
to
their
forefathers
had
not
extended
his
forgiveness
to
them
it
was
however
by
the
of
god
that
his
prophets
and
particularly
ezekiel
were
allowed
to
make
known
to
them
the
true
cause
of
their
downfall
the
more
ezekiel
in
his
retreat
meditated
upon
their
lot
the
more
did
the
past
appear
to
him
as
a
lamentable
conflict
between
divine
justice
and
jewish
iniquity
at
the
time
of
their
sojourn
in
egypt
jahveh
had
taken
the
house
of
jacob
under
his
protection
and
in
consideration
of
his
help
had
merely
demanded
of
them
that
they
should
be
faithful
to
him
ye
away
every
man
the
abominations
of
his
eyes
and
defile
not
yourselves
with
the
idols
of
egypt
i
am
the
lord
your
the
children
of
israel
however
had
never
observed
this
easy
condition
and
this
was
the
root
of
their
ills
even
before
they
were
liberated
from
the
yoke
of
pharaoh
they
had
betrayed
their
protector
and
he
had
thought
to
punish
them
i
wrought
for
my
sake
that
it
should
not
be
profaned
in
the
sight
of
the
nations
among
whom
they
were
in
whose
sight
i
made
myself
known
unto
them
so
i
caused
them
to
go
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
brought
them
into
the
wilderness
and
i
gave
them
my
statutes
and
showed
them
my
judgments
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
live
in
them
moreover
also
i
gave
them
my
sabbaths
to
be
a
sign
between
me
and
them
but
the
house
of
israel
rebelled
against
as
they
had
acted
in
egypt
so
they
acted
at
the
foot
of
sinai
and
again
jahveh
could
not
bring
himself
to
destroy
them
he
confined
himself
to
decreeing
that
none
of
those
who
had
offended
him
should
enter
the
promised
land
and
he
extended
his
goodness
to
their
children
but
these
again
showed
themselves
no
wiser
than
their
fathers
scarcely
had
they
taken
possession
of
the
inheritance
which
had
fallen
to
them
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
the
glory
of
all
lands
than
when
they
beheld
high
hill
and
every
thick
tree
they
offered
there
their
sacrifices
and
there
they
presented
the
provocation
of
their
offering
there
also
they
made
their
sweet
savour
and
they
poured
out
there
their
drink
not
contented
with
profaning
their
altars
by
impious
ceremonies
and
offerings
they
further
bowed
the
knee
to
idols
thinking
in
their
hearts
will
be
as
the
nations
as
the
families
of
the
countries
to
serve
wood
and
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
with
a
mighty
hand
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm
and
with
fury
poured
out
will
i
be
king
over
ezek
xx
however
just
the
punishment
bzekiel
did
not
believe
that
it
would
last
for
ever
the
righteousness
of
god
would
not
permit
future
generations
to
be
held
responsible
for
ever
for
the
sins
of
generations
past
and
present
mean
ye
that
ye
use
this
proverb
concerning
the
land
of
israel
saying
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
and
the
teeth
are
set
on
edge
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
ye
shall
not
have
occasion
to
use
this
proverb
any
more
in
israel
behold
all
souls
are
mine
as
the
soul
of
the
father
so
also
the
soul
of
the
son
is
mine
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
but
if
a
man
be
just
he
shall
surely
live
saith
the
lord
israel
therefore
was
master
of
his
own
destiny
if
he
persisted
in
erring
from
the
right
way
the
hour
of
salvation
was
still
further
removed
from
him
if
he
repented
and
observed
the
law
the
divine
anger
would
be
turned
away
o
house
of
israel
cast
away
from
you
all
your
transgressions
wherein
ye
have
transgressed
and
make
you
a
new
heart
and
a
new
spirit
for
why
will
ye
die
o
house
of
israel
for
i
have
no
pleasure
in
the
death
of
him
that
dieth
wherefore
turn
yourselves
and
there
were
those
who
objected
that
it
was
too
late
to
dream
of
regeneration
and
of
hope
in
the
future
bones
are
dried
up
and
our
hope
is
lost
we
are
clean
cut
the
prophet
replied
that
the
lord
had
carried
him
in
the
spirit
and
set
him
down
in
the
midst
of
a
plain
strewn
with
bones
i
prophesied
and
as
i
prophesied
there
was
a
noise
and
the
bones
came
together
bone
to
his
bone
and
i
beheld
and
lo
there
were
sinews
upon
them
and
flesh
came
up
and
skin
covered
them
above
but
there
was
no
breath
in
them
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
prophesy
unto
the
wind
prophesy
son
of
man
and
say
to
the
wind
thus
saith
the
lord
god
come
from
the
four
winds
o
breath
and
breathe
upon
these
slain
that
they
may
live
so
i
prophesied
as
he
commanded
me
and
the
breath
came
into
them
and
they
lived
and
stood
up
upon
their
feet
an
exceeding
great
army
then
he
said
unto
me
these
bones
are
the
whole
house
of
israel
behold
i
will
open
your
graves
and
cause
you
to
come
up
out
of
your
graves
o
my
people
and
i
will
bring
you
into
the
land
of
israel
and
i
will
put
my
spirit
in
you
and
ye
shall
live
and
i
will
place
you
in
your
own
land
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
and
performed
it
saith
the
a
people
raised
from
such
depths
would
require
a
constitution
a
new
law
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
from
the
day
when
the
exile
should
cease
ezekiel
would
willingly
have
dispensed
with
the
monarchy
as
it
had
been
tried
since
the
time
of
samuel
with
scarcely
any
good
results
for
every
hezekiah
or
josiah
how
many
kings
of
the
type
of
ahaz
or
manasseh
had
there
been
the
jews
were
nevertheless
still
so
sincerely
attached
to
the
house
of
david
that
the
prophet
judged
it
inopportune
to
exclude
it
from
his
plan
for
their
future
government
he
resolved
to
tolerate
a
king
but
a
king
of
greater
piety
and
with
less
liberty
than
the
compiler
of
the
book
of
deuteronomy
had
pictured
to
himself
a
servant
of
the
servants
of
god
whose
principal
function
should
be
to
provide
the
means
of
worship
indeed
the
lord
himself
was
the
only
sovereign
whom
the
prophet
fully
accepted
though
his
concept
of
him
differed
greatly
from
that
of
his
predecessors
from
that
for
instance
of
amos
the
lord
god
who
would
do
nothing
without
revealing
secret
unto
his
servants
the
prophets
or
of
hosea
who
desired
and
not
sacrifice
and
the
knowledge
of
god
more
than
burnt
the
jahveh
of
ezekiel
no
longer
admitted
any
intercourse
with
the
interpreters
of
his
will
he
held
son
of
at
a
distance
and
would
consent
to
communicate
with
him
only
by
means
of
angels
who
were
his
messengers
the
love
of
his
people
was
indeed
acceptable
to
him
but
he
preferred
their
reverence
and
fear
and
the
smell
of
the
sacrifice
offered
according
to
the
law
was
pleasing
to
his
nostrils
the
first
care
of
the
returning
exiles
therefore
would
be
to
build
him
a
house
upon
the
holy
mountain
ezekiel
called
to
mind
the
temple
of
solomon
in
which
the
years
of
his
youth
were
spent
and
mentally
rebuilt
it
on
the
same
plan
but
larger
and
more
beautiful
first
the
outer
court
then
the
inner
court
and
its
chambers
and
lastly
the
sanctuary
the
dimensions
of
which
he
calculates
with
scrupulous
care
the
breadth
of
the
entrance
was
ten
cubits
and
the
sides
of
the
entrance
were
five
cubits
on
the
one
side
and
five
cubits
on
the
other
side
and
he
measured
the
length
thereof
forty
cubits
and
the
breadth
twenty
and
so
forth
with
a
wealth
of
technical
details
often
difficult
to
be
understood
and
as
a
building
so
well
proportioned
should
be
served
by
a
priesthood
worthy
of
it
the
sons
of
zadok
only
were
to
bear
the
sacerdotal
office
for
they
alone
had
preserved
their
faith
unshaken
the
other
lévites
were
to
fill
merely
secondary
posts
for
not
only
had
they
shared
in
the
sins
of
the
nation
but
they
had
shown
a
bad
example
in
practising
idolatry
the
duties
and
prerogatives
of
each
one
the
tithes
and
offerings
the
sacrifices
the
solemn
festivals
the
preparation
of
the
feasts
all
was
foreseen
and
prearranged
with
scrupulous
exactitude
ezekiel
was
as
we
have
seen
a
priest
the
smallest
details
were
as
dear
to
him
as
the
noblest
offices
of
his
calling
and
the
minute
ceremonial
instructions
as
to
the
killing
and
cooking
of
the
sacrificial
animals
appeared
to
him
as
necessary
to
the
future
prosperity
of
his
people
as
the
moral
law
towards
the
end
however
the
imagination
of
the
seer
soared
above
the
formalism
of
the
sacrificing
priest
he
saw
in
a
vision
waters
issuing
out
of
the
very
threshold
of
the
divine
house
flowing
towards
the
dead
sea
through
a
forest
of
fruit
trees
leaf
shall
not
wither
neither
shall
the
fruit
thereof
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
alike
those
of
whom
a
remnant
still
existed
as
well
as
those
which
at
different
times
had
become
extinct
were
to
divide
the
regenerated
land
by
lot
among
them
dan
in
the
extreme
north
reuben
and
judah
in
the
south
and
they
would
unite
to
found
once
more
around
mount

that
new
jerusalem
whose
name
henceforth
was
to
be
lord
is
ezek
xlviii
the
image
of
the
river
seems
to
be
borrowed
from
the
of
of
chaldæan
mythology
the
influence
of
ezekiel
does
not
seem
to
have
extended
beyond
a
restricted
circle
of
admirers
untouched
by
his
preaching
many
of
the
exiles
still
persisted
in
their
worship
of
the
heathen
gods
most
of
these
probably
became
merged
in
the
bulk
of
the
chaldæan
population
and
were
lost
as
far
as
israel
was
concerned
as
completely
as
were
the
earlier
exiles
of
ephraim
under
iii
and
sargon
the
greater
number
of
the
jews
however
remained
faithful
to
their
hopes
of
future
greatness
and
applied
themselves
to
discerning
in
passing
events
the
premonitory
signs
of
deliverance
as
a
woman
with
child
that
draweth
near
the
time
of
her
delivery
is
in
pain
and
crieth
out
in
her
pangs
so
have
we
been
before
thee
o
lord
come
my
people
enter
thou
into
thy
chambers
and
shut
thy
doors
about
thee
hide
thyself
for
a
little
moment
until
the
indignation
be
overpast
for
behold
the
lord
cometh
forth
out
of
his
place
to
punish
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
for
their
iniquity
the
earth
also
shall
disclose
her
blood

the
task
which
cyrus
had
undertaken
was
not
so
difficult
as
we
might
imagine
not
only
was
he
hailed
with
delight
by
the
strangers
who
thronged
babylonia
but
the
babylonians
themselves
were
weary
of
their
king
and
the
majority
of
them
were
ready
to
welcome
the
persian
who
would
rid
them
of
him
as
in
old
days
they
hailed
the
assyrian
kings
who
delivered
them
from
their
chaldæan
lords
it
is
possible
that
towards
the
end
of
his
reign
nabonidus
partly
resumed
the
supreme
power
but
anxious
for
the
future
and
depending
but
little
on
human
help
he
had
sought
a
more
powerful
aid
at
the
hands
of
the
gods
he
had
apparently
revived
some
of
the
old
forgotten
cults
and
had
applied
to
their
use
revenues
which
impoverished
the
endowment
of
the
prevalent
worship
of
his
own
time
as
he
felt
the
growing
danger
approach
he
remembered
those
towns
of
secondary
grade
uru
uruk
larsam
and
eridu
all
of
which
lying
outside
scheme
of
defence
would
be
sacrificed
in
the
case
of
an
invasion
he
had
therefore
brought
away
from
them
the
most
venerated
statues
those
in
which
the
spirit
of
the
divinity
was
more
particularly
pleased
to
dwell
and
had
shut
them
up
in
the
capital
within
the
security
of
its
triple
rampart
this
seems
to
follow
from
the
part
which
he
plays
in
the
final
crisis
as
told
in
the
of
and
in
the
the
chronicler
adds
that
the
gods
of
sippar
kutha
and
borsippa
were
not
taken
to
babylon
and
indeed
these
cities
being
included
within
the
lines
of
defence
of
the
great
city
their
gods
were
as
well
defended
from
the
enemy
as
if
they
had
been
in
babylon
itself
this
attempt
to
concentrate
the
divine
powers
accentuating
as
it
did
the
supremacy
of
over
his
compeers
was
doubtless
flattering
to
his
pride
and
that
of
his
priests
but
was
ill
received
by
the
rest
of
the
sacerdotal
class
and
by
the
populace
all
these
divine
guests
had
not
only
to
be
lodged
but
required
to
be
watched
over
decked
fed
and
feted
together
with
their
respective
temple
retinues
and
the
prestige
and
honour
of
the
local
bel
as
well
as
his
revenues
were
likely
to
suffer
in
consequence
the
clamour
of
the
gods
in
the
celestial
heights
soon
throughout
the
land
the
divinities
complained
of
their
sojourn
at
babylon
as
of
a
captivity
in
they
lamented
over
the
suppression
of
their
daily
sacrifices
and
marduk
at
length
took
pity
on
them
he
looked
upon
the
countries
of
sumir
and
akkad
and
saw
their
sanctuaries
in
ruins
and
their
towns
lifeless
as
corpses
cast
his
eyes
over
the
surrounding
regions
he
searched
them
with
his
glance
and
sought
out
a
prince
upright
after
his
own
heart
who
should
take
his
hands
he
proclaimed
by
name
cyrus
king
of
anshân
and
he
called
him
by
his
name
to
universal
alike
for
the
people
of
babylon
and
for
the
exiled
jew
and
also
doubtless
for
other
cyrus
appeared
as
a
deliverer
chosen
by
the
gods
his
speedy
approach
was
everywhere
expected
if
not
with
the
same
impatience
at
least
with
an
almost
joyful
resignation
his
plans
were
carried
into
action
in
the
early
months
of
and
his
habitual
good
fortune
did
not
forsake
him
at
this
decisive
moment
of
his
career
the
immense
citadel
raised
by
nebuchadrezzar
in
the
midst
of
his
empire
in
anticipation
of
an
attack
by
the
medes
was
as
yet
intact
and
the
walls
rising
one
behind
another
the
moats
and
the
canals
and
marshes
which
protected
it
had
been
so
well
kept
up
or
restored
since
his
time
that
their
security
was
absolutely
complete
a
besieging
army
could
do
little
harm
it
needed
a
whole
nation
in
revolt
to
compass
its
downfall
a
whole
nation
also
was
required
for
its
defence
but
the
babylonians
were
not
inclined
to
second
the
efforts
of
their
sovereign
nabonidus
concentrated
his
troops
at
the
point
most
threatened
in
the
angle
comprised
near
opis
between
the
medic
wall
and
the
bend
of
the
tigris
and
waited
in
inaction
the
commencement
of
the
attack
it
is
supposed
that
cyrus
put
two
bodies
of
troops
in
motion
one
leaving
susa
under
his
own
command
took
the
usual
route
of
all
blamite
invasions
in
the
direction
of
the
confluence
of
the
tigris
and
the
dîyala
the
other
commanded
by
gobryas
the
satrap
of
gutium
followed
the
course
of
the
adhem
or
the
dîyala
and
brought
the
northern
contingents
to
the
from
what
we
know
of
the
facts
as
a
whole
it
would
appear
that
the
besieging
force
chose
the
neighbourhood
of
the
present
bagdad
to
make
a
breach
in
the
fortifications
taking
advantage
of
the
months
when
the
rivers
were
at
their
lowest
they
drew
off
the
water
from
the
dîyala
and
the
tigris
till
they
so
reduced
the
level
that
they
were
able
to
cross
on
foot
they
then
cut
their
way
through
the
ramparts
on
the
left
bank
and
rapidly
transported
the
bulk
of
their
forces
into
the
very
centre
of
the
position
the
principal
body
of
the
chaldæan
troops
were
still
at
opis
cut
off
from
the
capital

upon
them

them
on
the
banks
of

early
days

on
the

which
at
once
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
persian

babylon
without
striking
a
blow
and
nabonidus
surrendered
himself

prisoner

the
strategic
interpretation
of
the
events
of
this
campaign
i
have
generally
adopted
the
explanations
of
billerbeck
account
with
regard
to
the
river

probably
a
reminiscence
of
alterations
made
in

direction
of

the
of

marduk
make

enter

the
of
confirm
this
testimony
of
the
official
account
the
victorious
army
had
received
orders
to
avoid
all
excesses
which
would
offend
the
people
they
respected
the
property
of
the
citizens
and
of
the
temples

a
strong
detachment
around
to
protect
it
from
plunder
and
no

soldier

allowed
within
the
enclosure
until
the

determined
on
the
fate
of
the
vanquished
cyrus
arrived
after
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
on
the
of
and
his
first
act
was
one
of
clemency
he
prohibited
all
pillage
granted
mercy
to
the
inhabitants
and
entrusted
the
government
of
the
city
to
gobryas
the
son
of
nabonidus
remained
to
be
dealt
with
and
his
energetic
nature
might
have
been
the
cause
of
serious
difficulties
had
he
been
allowed
an
opportunity
of
rallying
the
last
partisans
of
the
dynasty
around
him
gobryas
set
out
to
attack
him
and
on
the
of
succeeded
in
surprising
and
slaying
him
with
him
perished
the
last
hope
of
the
chaldæans
and
the
nobles
and
towns
still
hesitating
on
what
course
to
pursue
now
vied
with
each
other
in
their
haste
to
tender
submission
the
means
of
securing
their
good
will
at
all
events
for
the
moment
was
clearly
at
hand
and
it
was
used
without
any
delay
their
gods
were
at
once
restored
to
them
this
exodus
extended
over
nearly
two
months
during
and
adar
and
on
its
termination
a
proclamation
of
six
days
of
mourning
up
to
the
of
nisân
was
made
for
the
death
of
and
as
an
atonement
for
the
faults
of
nabonidus
after
which
on
the
of
nisân
the
notables
of
the
city
were
called
together
in
the
temple
of
nebo
to
join
in
the
last
expiatory
ceremonies
cyrus
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
act
as
iii
and
most
of
the
sargonids
had
done
he
the
hands
of
bel
and
proclaimed
himself
king
of
the
country
but
in
order
to
secure
the
succession
he
associated
his
son

with
himself
as
king
of

mesopotamia
having
been
restored
to

and
kissed
the
feet
of
the
events
had
followed
one
another
so
quickly
and
had
entailed
so
little
bloodshed
that
popular
imagination
was
quite
disconcerted
it
could
not
conceive
that
an
empire
of
such
an
extent
and
of
so
formidable
an
appearance
should
have
succumbed
almost
without
a
battle
and
three
generations
had
not
elapsed
before
an
entire
cycle
of
legends
had
gathered
round
the
catastrophe
they
related
how
cyrus
having
set
out
to
make
war
with
provisions
of
all
kinds
for
his
household
and
especially
with
his
usual
stores
of
water
from
the
river
choaspes
the
only
kind
of
which
he
deigned
to
drink
had
reached
the
banks
of
the
gyndes
while
seeking
for
a
ford
one
of
the
white
horses
consecrated
to
the
sun
sprang
into
the
river
and
being
overturned
by
the
current
was
drowned
before
it
could
be
rescued
cyrus
regarded
this
accident
as
a
personal
affront
and
interrupted
his
expedition
to
avenge
it
he
employed
his
army
during
one
entire
summer
in
digging
three
hundred
and
sixty
canals
and
thus
caused
the
principal
arm
of
the
stream
to
run
dry
and
he
did
not
resume
his
march
upon
babylon
till
the
following
spring
when
the
level
of
the
water
was
low
enough
to
permit
of
a
woman
crossing
from
one
bank
to
the
other
without
wetting
her
knees
the
babylonians
at
first
attempted
to
prevent
the
blockade
of
the
place
but
being
repulsed
in
their
they
retired
within
the
walls
much
to
annoyance
for
they
were
provisioned
for
several
years
he
therefore
undertook
to
turn
the
course
of
the
euphrates
into
the
and
having
accomplished
it
he
crept
into
the
centre
of
the
city
by
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
if
the
babylonians
had
kept
proper
guard
the
persians
would
probably
have
been
surrounded
and
caught
like
fish
in
a
net
but
on
that
particular
day
they
were
keeping
one
of
their
festivals
and
continued
their
dancing
and
singing
till
they
suddenly
found
the
streets
alive
with
the
enemy
babylon
suffered
in
no
way
by
her
servitude
and
far
from
its
being
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
her
she
actually
rejoiced
in
it
she
was
rid
of
nabonidus
whose
sacrilegious
innovations
had
scandalised
her
piety
and
she
possessed
in
cyrus
a
legitimate
sovereign
since
he
had
the
hands
of
it
pleased
her
to
believe
that
she
had
conquered
her
victor
rather
than
been
conquered
by
him
and
she
accommodated
herself
to
her
persian
dynasty
after
the
same
fashion
that
she
had
in
turn
accustomed
herself
to
cossæan
or
elamite
ninevite
or
chaldæan
dynasties
in
days
gone
by
nothing
in
or
around
the
city
was
changed
and
she
remained
what
she
had
been
since
the
fall
of
assyria
the
real
capital
of
the
regions
situated
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
zagros
it
seems
that
none
of
her
subjects
whether
syrians
tyrians
arabs
or
idumæans
attempted
to
revolt
against
their
new
master
but
passively
accepted
him
and
the
persian
dominion
extended
uncontested
as
far
as
the
isthmus
of
suez
cyprus
even
and
such
of
the
phoenicians
as
were
still
dependencies
of
egypt
did
homage
to
her
without
further
hesitation
the
jews
alone
appeared
only
half
satisfied
for
the
clemency
shown
by
cyrus
to
their
oppressors
disappointed
their
hopes
and
the
predictions
of
their
prophets
they
had
sung
in
anticipation
of
children
killed
before
their

of
houses
pillaged
of

the
glory
of

that
of

her

had
to
content
themselves
with
obtaining
the
cessation
of
their
exile
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
they
had
contributed
to
the
downfall
of
nabonidus
otherwise
than
by
the
fervency
of
their
prayers
or
if
they
had
rendered
cyrus
some
service
either
in
the
course
of
his
preparations
or
during
his
short
campaign
they
may
have
contemplated
taking
up
arms
in
his
cause
and
have
been
unable
to
carry
the
project
into
execution
owing
to
the
rapidity
with
which
events
took
place
however
this
may
be
he
desired
to
reward
them
for
their
good
intentions
and
in
the
same
year
as
his
victory
he
promulgated
a
solemn
edict
in
which
he
granted
them
permission
to
return
to
judah
and
to
rebuild
not
only
their
city
but
the
temple
of
their
god
the
inhabitants
of
the
places
where
they
were
living
were
charged
to
furnish
them
with
silver
gold
materials
and
cattle
which
would
be
needed
by
those
among
them
who
should
claim
the
benefits
of
the
edict
they
even
had
restored
to
them
by
order
of
the
king
what
remained
in
the
babylonian
treasury
of
the
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
which
had
belonged
to
the
sanctuary
of
jahveh
the
heads
of
the
community
received
the
favour
granted
to
them
from
such
high
quarters
without
any
enthusiasm
now
that
they
were
free
to
go
they
discovered
that
they
were
well
off
at
babylon
they
would
have
to
give
up
their
houses
their
fields
their
business
their
habits
of
indifference
to
politics
and
brave
the
dangers
of
a
caravan
journey
of
three
or
four
duration
finally
encamping
in
the
midst
of
ruins
in
an
impoverished
country
surrounded
by
hostile
and
jealous
neighbours
such
a
prospect
was
not
likely
to
find
favour
with
many
and
indeed
it
was
only
the
priests
the
lévites
and
the
more
ardent
of
the
lower
classes
who
welcomed
the
idea
of
the
return
with
a
touching
fervour
the
first
detachment
organised
their
departure
in
under
the
auspices
of
one
of
the
princes
of
the
royal
house
named
sheshbazzar
a
son
of
jehoiachin
it
comprised
only
a
small
number
of
families
and
contained
doubtless
a
few
of
the
captives
of
nebuchadrezzar
who
in
their
childhood
had
seen
the
temple
standing
and
had
been
present
at
its
destruction
the
name
which
is
written
sheshbazzar
in
the
hebrew
text
of
the
book
of
ezra
i
is
rendered
sasabalassaros
in
recension
of
the
septuagint
and
this
latter
form
confirms
the
hypothesis
of
hoonacker
which
is
now
universally
accepted
that
it
corresponds
to
the
babylonian
it
is
known
that
shamash
becomes
shauash
in
babylonian
thus
saosdukhînos
comes
from
similarly
has
become
imbert
has
recognised
sheshbazzar
in
the
shenazzar
mentioned
in
chron
iii
as
being
one
of
the
sons
of
jeconiah
and
this
identification
has
been
accepted
by
several
recent
historians
of
israel
it
should
be
remembered
that
abaluzur
and
zerubbabel
have
long
been
confounded
one
with
the
other
the
returning
exiles
at
first
settled
in
the
small
towns
of
judah
and
benjamin
and
it
was
not
until
seven
months
after
their
arrival
that
they
summoned
courage
to
clear
the
sacred
area
in
order
to
erect
in
its
midst
an
altar
of
sacrifice
the
history
of
this
first
return
from
captivity
is
summarily
set
forth
in
ezra
cf
vi
its
authenticity
has
been
denied
with
regard
to
this
point
and
the
questions
relating
to
jewish
history
after
the
exile
the
modifications
which
have
been
imposed
on
the
original
plan
of
this
work
have
obliged
me
to
suppress
much
detail
in
the
text
and
the
whole
of
the
bibliography
in
the
notes
they
formed
there
in
the
land
of
their
fathers
a
little
colony
almost
lost
among
the
heathen
nations
of
former
times
philistines
idumasans
moabites
ammonites
and
the
settlers
implanted
at
various
times
in
what
had
been
the
kingdom
of
israel
by
the
sovereigns
of
assyria
and
chaldæa
grouped
around
the
persian
governor
who
alone
was
able
to
protect
them
from
the
hatred
of
their
rivals
they
had
no
hope
of
prospering
or
even
of
maintaining
their
position
except
by
exhibiting
an
unshaken
fidelity
to
their
deliverers
it
was
on
this
very
feeling
that
cyrus
mainly
relied
when
he
granted
them
permission
to
return
to
their
native
hills
and
he
was
actuated
as
much
by
a
policy
as
from
the
promptings
of
instinctive
generosity
it
was
with
satisfaction
that
he
saw
in
that
distant
province
lying
on
the
frontier
of
the
only
enemy
yet
left
to
him
in
the
old
world
a
small
band
devoted
perforce
to
his
interests
and
whose
very
existence
depended
entirely
on
that
of
his
empire
he
no
doubt
extended
the
same
favour
to
the
other
exiles
in
chaldæa
who
demanded
it
of
him
but
we
do
not
know
how
many
of
them
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
return
to
their
native
countries
and
this
exodus
of
the
jews
still
remains
so
far
as
we
know
a
unique
fact
the
administration
continued
the
same
as
it
had
been
under
the
chaldæans
aramæan
was
still
the
official
language
in
the
provincial
dependencies
and
the
only
change
effected
was
the
placing
of
persians
at
the
head
of
public
offices
as
in
asia
minor
and
allowing
them
a
body
of
troops
to
support
their
authority
the
presence
of
persian
troops
in
asia
minor
is
proved
by
the
passage
in
herodotus
where
he
says
that
orotes
had
with
him
persians
as
his
one
great
state
alone
remained
of
all
those
who
had
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
history
of
the
east
this
was
egypt
and
the
policy
which
her
rulers
had
pursued
since
the
development
of
the
iranian
power
apparently
rendered
a
struggle
with
it
inevitable
amasis
had
taken
part
in
all
the
coalitions
which
had
as
their
object
the
perpetuation
of
the
balance
of
the
powers
in
western
asia
he
had
made
a
treaty
with
croesus
and
it
is
possible
that
his
contingents
had
fought
in
the
battles
before
sardes
lydia
having
fallen
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
encourage
nabonidus
in
his
resistance
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
cyrus
he
understood
that
a
collision
was
imminent
and
did
his
best
in
preparing
to
meet
it
even
if
cyrus
had
forgotten
the
support
which
had
been
freely
given
to
his
rivals
the
wealth
of
egypt
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
attract
the
persian
hordes
to
her
frontiers
a
century
later
the
egyptians
looking
back
on
the
past
with
a
melancholy
retrospection
confessed
that
had
the
valley
been
more
flourishing
or
happier
than
under
amasis
never
had
the
river
shown
itself
more
beneficent
to
the
soil
nor
the
soil
more
fertile
for
mankind
and
the
inhabitated
towns
might
be
reckoned
at
in
the
widespread
activity
exhibited
under
psammetichus
and
apries
was
redoubled
under
the
usurper
and
the
quarries
of
turah
silsileh
assuan
and
even
those
of
hammamât
were
worked
as
in
the
palmy
days
of
the
theban
dynasties

whose
position
just
below
the
cataract
attracted
to
it
the
attention
of
the
military
engineers

carefully
fortified
and
a
temple
built
upon
it

materials
of
which
were
used
later
on

the
masonry
of
the
sanctuary

times

a
certain
outburst
of
vitality
under

given
by

by

of

palace

small

built
in
the
centre
of

to
the
devotion
to

she
was
the
priestess
wealthy
private
individuals
did
their
best
to
emulate
their
example
and
made
for
themselves
at
shêkh
and
at
assassif
those
tombs
which
rival
those
of
the
best
periods
in
their
extent
and
the
beauty
of
their
a
stele
of
his
year
still
exists
in
the
quarries
of
the
mokattam
according
to
herodotus
it
was
from
the
quarries
of
elephantine
that
amasis
caused
to
be
brought
the
largest
blocks
which
he
used

tomb

at

and
the
sarcophagus
taken
from

the
most
important
of
these

is
that
of

was
associated
with
ankhnasnofiribri

most

such
a

it

no

abydos
occupied
too
important
a
place
in

the

the

the
work
of
general
restoration
to
one
of
the
principal
personages
of
his
court
pefzââunît

who
devoted
his
attention
chiefly
to
two
buildings
the
great

the
very
ancient
necropolis

suffered
considerably
during

described
as
extending

that

at

moment

far
as
a

spot
in

heaved
a

with

expended

one
of

was
crushed
to

for
centuries
succeeding

came

in
thinking
that
herodotus
saw
the
monument
of
amasis
lying
on
its
side
and
that
he
took
for
the
height
what
was
really
the
width
in

it
had
been
erected
in
the
nome
of
athribis
and
afterwards
taken

about

ptolemaic
era
it
was
discovered
under
water
in
one
of
the
ports
of
the
town

the
beginning
of
this
century
and
drovetti
who
recovered
it
gave
it
to
the
museum

amasis
in
devoting
his
revenues
to
such
magnificent
works
fully
shared
the
spirit
of
the
older
pharaohs
and
his
labours
were
nattering
to
the
national
vanity
even
though
many
lives
were
sacrificed
in
their
accomplishment
but
the
glory
which
they
reflected
on
egypt
did
not
have
the
effect
of
removing
the
unpopularity
in
which
tie
was
personally
held
the
revolution
which
overthrew
apries
had
been
provoked
by
the
hatred
of
the
native
party
towards
the
foreigners
he
himself
had
been
the
instrument
by
which
it
had
been
accomplished
and
it
would
have
been
only
natural
that
having
achieved
a
triumph
in
spite
of
the
greeks
and
the
mercenaries
he
should
have
wished
to
be
revenged
on
them
and
have
expelled
them
from
his
dominions
but
as
a
fact
nothing
of
the
kind
took
place
and
amasis
once
crowned
forgot
the
wrongs
he
had
suffered
as
an
aspirant
to
the
royal
dignity
no
sooner
was
he
firmly
seated
on
the
throne
than
he
recalled
the
strangers
and
showed
that
he
had
only
friendly
intentions
with
regard
to
them
his
predecessors
had
received
them
into
favour
he
in
fact
showed
a
perfect
infatuation
for
them
and
became
as
complete
a
greek
as
it
was
possible
for
an
egyptian
to
be
his
first
care
had
been
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
dorians
of
oyrene
and
he
displayed
so
much
tact
in
dealing
with
them
that
they
forgave
him
for
the
skirmish
of
irasa
and
invited
him
to
act
as
arbitrator
in
their
dissensions
a
certain
arkesilas
ii
had
recently
succeeded
the
battos
who
had
defeated
the
egyptian
troops
but
his
suspicious
temper
had
obliged
his
brothers
to
separate
themselves
from
him
and
they
had
founded
further
westwards
the
independent
city
of
barca
on
his
threatening
to
evict
them
they
sent
a
body
of
libyans
against

fighting
ensued
and
he
was
beaten
close
to
the
town
of
leukon
he
lost
hoplites
in
the
engagement
and
the
disaster
aroused
so
much
against
him
that
laarchos
another
of
his
brothers
strangled
him
laarchos
succeeded
him
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
soldiery
but
not
long
after
eryxô
and
polyarchos
the
wife
and
of
his
victim
surprised
and
assassinated
him
in
his
turn
the
partisans
of
laarchos
then
had
recourse
to
the
pharaoh
who
showed
himself
disposed
to
send
them
help
but
his
preparations
were
suspended
owing
to
the
death
of
his
mother
polyarchos
repaired
to
egypt
before
the
royal
mourning
was
ended
and
pleaded
his
cause
with
such
urgency
that
he
won
over
the
king
to
his
side
he
obtained
the
royal
investiture
for
his
child
who
was
still
a
minor
battos
the
lame
and
thus
placed
oyrene
in
a
sort
of
vassalage
to
the
egyptian
crown
herodotus
narrates
these
events
without
mentioning
amasis
and
nicolas
of
damascus
adopted
account
with
certain
modifications
taken
from
other
sources
the
intervention
of
amasis
is
mentioned
only
by
plutarch
and
by
polyaanus
but
the
record
of
it
had
been
handed
down
to
them
by
some
more
ancient
author
perhaps
by
akesandros
or
perhaps
in
the
first
instance
by
hellanicos
of
lesbos
who
gave
a
somewhat
detailed
account
of
certain
points
in
egyptian
history
the
passage
of
herodotus
is
also
found
incorporated
in
accounts
of
cyrenian
origin
his
informants
were
interested
in
recalling
deeds
which
reflected
glory
on
their
country
like
the
defeat
of
apries
at
irasa
but
not
in
the
memory
of
events
so
humiliating
for
them
as
the
sovereign
intervention
of
pharaoh
only
a
few
years
after
this
victory
and
besides
the
merely
pacific
success
which
amasis
achieved
was
not
of
a
nature
to
leave
a
profound
mark
on
the
egyptian
mind
it
is
thus
easy
to
explain
how
it
was
that
herodotus
makes
no
allusion
to
the
part
played
by
egypt
in
this
affair
the
ties
which
connected
the
two
courts
were
subsequently
drawn
closer
by
marriage
partly
from
policy
and
partly
from
a
whim
amasis
espoused
a
cyrenian
woman
named
ladikê
the
daughter
according
to
some
of
arkesilas
or
of
battos
according
to
others
of
a
wealthy
private
individual
named
kritobulos
the
greeks
of
europe
and
asia
minor
fared
no
less
to
their
own
satisfaction
at
his
hand
than
their
compatriots
in
africa
following
the
example
of
his
ally
croesus
he
entered
into
relations
with
their
oracles
on
several
occasions
and
sent
them
magnificent
presents
the
temple
of
delphi
having
been
burnt
down
in
the
athenian
family
of
the
alcmæonides
undertook
to
rebuild
it
from
the
ground
for
the
sum
of
three
hundred
talents
of
which
was
to
be
furnished
by
the
delphians
when
these
being
too
poor
to
pay
the
sum
out
of
their
own
resources
made
an
appeal
to
the
generosity
of
other
friendly
powers
amasis
graciously
offered
them
a
thousand
talents
of
egyptian
alum
then
esteemed
the
most
precious
of
all
others
alum
was
employed
in
dyeing
and
was
an
expensive
commodity
in
the
markets
of
europe
the
citizens
of
delphi
were
all
the
more
sensible
of
generosity
since
the
united
greeks
of
the
nile
valley
contributed
only
twenty
of
the
same
mineral
as
their
quota
amasis
erected
at
cyrene
a
statue
of
his
wife
ladikê
and
another
of
the
goddess
neît
gilded
from
head
to
foot
and
to
these
he
added
his
own
portrait
probably
painted
on
a
wooden
panel
the
very
fact
of
the
marriage
is
considered
by
wiedemann
as
a
pure
legend
but
there
is
nothing
against
its
authenticity
the
curious
story
of
the
relations
of
the
woman
with
amasis
told
by
the
cyrenian
commentators
is
the
only
part
which
need
be
rejected
the
text
of
herodotus
can
only
mean
a
painted
panel
similar
to
those
which
have
been
found
on
the
mummies
of
the
era
in
the
fayum
he
gave
to
athene
of
lindos
two
stone
statues
and
a
corselet
of
linen
of
marvellous
fineness
and
hera
of
samos
received
two
wooden
statues
which
a
century
later
herodotus
found
still
intact
the
greeks
flocked
to
egypt
from
all
quarters
of
the
world
in
such
considerable
numbers
that
the
laws
relating
to
them
had
to
be
remodelled
in
order
to
avoid
conflicts
with
the
natives
it
seems
that
one
of
these
statues
is
that
which
after
being
taken
to
constantinople
was
destroyed
in
a
fire
in
fragments
of
the
corselet
still
existed
in
the
first
century
of
our
era
but
inquisitive
persons
used
to
tear
off
pieces
to
see
for
themselves
whether
as
herodotus
assures
us
each
thread
was
composed
of
three
hundred
and
strands
every
one
visible
with
the
naked
eye
the
townships
founded
a
century
earlier
along
the
pelusiac
arm
of
the
nile
had
increased
still
further
since
the
time
of
necho
and
to
their
activity
was
attributable
the
remarkable
prosperity
of
the
surrounding
region
but
the
position
which
they
occupied
on
the
most
exposed
side
of
egypt
was
regarded
as
permanently
endangering
the
security
of
the
country
her
liberty
would
be
imperilled
should
they
revolt
during
a
war
with
the
neighbouring
empire
and
hand
over
the
line
of
defence
which
was
garrisoned
by
them
to
the
invader
amasis
therefore
dispossessed
their
inhabitants
and
transferred
them
to
memphis
and
its
environs
the
change
benefited
him
in
two
ways
for
while
securing
himself
from
possible
treason
he
gained
a
faithful
guard
for
himself
in
the
event
of
risings
taking
place
in
his
turbulent
capital
while
he
thus
distributed
these
colonists
of
ancient
standing
to
his
best
interests
he
placed
those
of
quite
recent
date
in
the
part
of
the
delta
furthest
removed
from
asia
where
surveillance
was
most
easy
in
the
triangle
namely
lying
to
the
west
of
sais
between
the
canopic
branch
of
the
nile
the
mountains
and
the
the
milesians
had
established
here
some
time
previously
on
a
canal
connected
with
the
main
arm
of
the
river
the
factory
of
naucratis
which
long
remained
in
obscurity
but
suddenly
developed
at
the
beginning
of
the
xxvith
dynasty
when
sais
became
the
favourite
residence
of
the
pharaohs
this
town
amasis
made
over
to
the
greeks
so
that
they
might
make
it
the
commercial
and
religious
centre
of
their
communities
in
egypt
illustration
the
present
site
of
naucratis
reduced
by
from
the
plan
published
by
petrie
the
site
of
the
hellenion
is
marked
a
the
modern
arab
village
b
the
temenos
of
hera
and
apollo
e
that
of
the
dioskuri
f
and
that
of
aphrodite
temples
already
existed
there
those
of
apollo
and
aphrodite
together
with
all
the
political
and
religious
institutions
indispensable
to
the
constitution
of
an
hellenic
city
but
the
influx
of
immigrants
was
so
large
and
rapid
that
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
the
entire
internal
organism
and
external
aspect
of
the
city
were
metamorphosed
new
buildings
rose
from
the
ground
with
incredible
speed
the
little
temple
of
the
dioskuri
the
protectors
of
the
sailor
the
temple
of
the
samian
hera
that
of
zeus
of
ægina
and
that
of
athene
ere
long
the
great
temenos
the
hellenion
was
erected
at
the
public
expense
by
nine
æolian
ionian
and
dorian
towns
of
asia
minor
to
serve
as
a
place
of
assembly
for
their
countrymen
as
a
storehouse
as
a
sanctuary
and
if
need
be
even
as
a
refuge
and
fortress
so
great
was
its
area
and
so
thick
its
walls
the
temple
of
athene
the
nît
of
the
saite
nome
is
as
yet
known
only
by
an
inscription
in
pctrie
the
site
has
been
rediscovered
by
petrie
at
the
southern
extremity
of
and
almost
outside
the
town
the
walls
were
about
feet
thick
and
feet
high
and
the
rectangular
area
enclosed
by
them
could
easily
contain
fifty
thousand
men
it
was
not
possible
for
the
constitution
of
naucratis
to
be
very
homogeneous
when
a
score
of
different
elements
assisted
in
its
composition
it
appears
to
have
been
a
compromise
between
the
institutions
of
the
dorians
and
those
of
the
ionians
its
supreme
magistrates
were
called
timuchi
but
their
length
of
office
and
functions
are
alike
unknown
to
us
the
inspectors
of
the
emporia
and
markets
could
be
elected
only
by
the
citizens
of
the
nine
towns
and
it
is
certain
that
the
chief
authority
was
not
entirely
in
the
hands
either
of
the
timuchi
or
the
inspectors
perhaps
each
quarter
of
the
town
had
its
council
taken
from
among
the
oldest
residents
a
prytanasum
was
open
to
all
comers
where
assemblies
and
banquets
were
held
on
here
were
celebrated
at
the
public
expense
the
festivals
of
dionysos
and
apollo
komasos
amasis
made
the
city
a
free
port
accessible
at
all
times
to
whoever
should
present
themselves
with
peaceable
intent
and
the
privileges
which
he
granted
naturally
brought
about
the
closing
of
all
the
other
seaports
of
egypt
when
a
greek
ship
pursued
by
pirates
buffeted
by
storms
or
disabled
by
an
accident
at
sea
ran
ashore
at
some
prohibited
spot
on
the
coast
the
captain
had
to
appear
before
the
nearest
magistrate
in
order
to
swear
that
he
had
not
violated
the
law
wilfully
but
from
the
force
of
circumstances
if
his
excuse
appeared
reasonable
he
was
permitted
to
make
his
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
canopic
branch
of
the
nile
but
when
the
state
of
the
wind
or
tide
did
not
allow
of
his
departure
his
cargo
was
transferred
to
boats
of
the
locality
and
sent
to
the
hellenic
settlement
by
the
canals
of
the
delta
this
provision
of
the
law
brought
prosperity
to
naucratis
the
whole
of
the
commerce
of
egypt
with
the
greek
world
passed
through
her
docks
and
in
a
few
years
she
became
one
of
the
wealthiest
emporia
of
the
mediterranean
the
inhabitants
soon
overflowed
the
surrounding
country
and
covered
it
with
villas
and
townships
such
merchants
as
refused
to
submit
to
the
rule
of
their
own
countrymen
found
a
home
in
some
other
part
of
the
valley
which
suited
them
and
even
upper
egypt
and
the
libyan
desert
were
subject
to
their
pacific
inroads
the
milesians
established
depots
in
the
ancient
city
of
abydos
the
cypriots
and
lesbians
and
the
people
of
ephesus
chios
and
samos
were
scattered
over
the
islands
formed
by
the
network
of
canals
and
arms
of
the
nile
and
delighted
in
giving
them
the
names
of
their
respective
countries
greeks
of
diverse
origin
settled
themselves
at
neapolis
not
far
from
panopolis
and
the
samians
belonging
to
the
æschrionian
tribe
penetrated
as
far
as
the
great
oasis
in
fact
there
was
scarcely
a
village
where
hellenic
traders
were
not
found
like
the
of
selling
wine
perfumes
oil
and
salted
provisions
to
the
natives
practising
usury
in
all
its
forms
and
averse
from
no
means
of
enriching
themselves
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
stephen
of
byzantium
the
name
of
the
town
is
said
to
be
derived
from
that
of
the
milesian
abydos
who
founded
it
probably
on
the
testimony
of
aristagoras
letronne
has
seen
that
the
historian
meant
a
factory
established
by
the
milesians
probably
in
the
reign
of
amasis
at
the
terminus
of
the
route
leading
to
the
great
oasis
the
compiler
confines
himself
to
stating
that
there
were
in
the
nile
islands
called
ephesus
chios
samos
lesbos
cyprus
and
so
on
the
explanation
i
have
given
in
the
text
accounts
for
this
curious
fact
quite
simply
those
who
returned
to
their
carried
thither
strange
tales
which
aroused
the
curiosity
and
cupidity
of
their
and
philosophers
merchants
and
soldiers
alike
set
out
for
the
land
of
wonders
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
wealth
or
adventures
amasis
ever
alert
upon
his
asiatic
frontier
and
always
anxious
to
strengthen
himself
in
that
quarter
against
a
chaldæan
or
persian
invasion
welcomed
them
with
open
arms
those
who
remained
in
the
country
obtained
employment
about
his
person
while
such
as
left
it
not
to
return
carried
away
with
them
the
memory
of
his
kindly
treatment
and
secured
for
him
in
hellas
alliances
of
which
he
might
one
day
stand
in
need
the
conduct
of
amasis
was
politic
but
it
aroused
the
of
his
subjects
against
him
like
the
jews
under
hezekiah
the
babylonians
under
nabonidus
and
all
other
decadent
races
threatened
by
ruin
they
attributed
their
decline
not
to
their
own
vices
but
to
the
machinations
of
an
angry
god
and
they
looked
on
favours
granted
to
strangers
as
a
sacrilege
had
not
the
greeks
brought
their
divinities
with
them
did
they
not
pervert
the
simple
so
that
they
associated
the
greek
religion
with
that
of
their
own
country
money
was
scarce
amasis
had
been
obliged
to
debit
the
rations
and
pay
of
his
mercenaries
to
the
accounts
of
the
most
venerated
egyptian
temples
those
of
sais
heliopolis
bubastis
and
memphis
and
each
of
these
institutions
had
to
rebate
so
much
per
cent
on
their
annual
revenues
in
favour
of
the
barbarians
and
hand
over
to
them
considerable
quantities
of
corn
cattle
poultry
stuffs
woods
perfumes
and
objects
of
all
kinds
the
priests
were
loud
in
their
indignation
the
echo
of
which
still
rang
in
the
ears
of
the
faithful
some
centuries
later
and
the
lower
classes
making
common
cause
with
their
priests
a
spirit
of
hatred
was
roused
among
the
populace
as
bitter
as
that
which
had
previously
caused
the
downfall
of
apries
as
the
fear
of
the
army
prevented
this
feeling
from
manifesting
itself
in
a
revolt
it
found
expression
in
the
secret
calumnies
which
were
circulated
against
the
king
and
misrepresented
the
motives
of
all
his
actions
scores
of
malicious
stories
were
repeated
vilifying
his
character
it
was
stated
that
before
his
accession
he
was
much
addicted
to
eating
and
drinking
but
that
suffering
from
want
of
money
he
had
not
hesitated
in
procuring
what
he
wished
for
by
all
sorts
of
means
the
most
honest
of
which
had
been
secret
theft
when
made
king
he
had
several
times
given
way
to
intoxication
to
such
an
extent
as
to
be
incapable
of
attending
to
public
business
his
ministers
were
then
obliged
to
relate
moral
tales
to
him
to
bring
him
to
a
state
of
reason
many
persons
having
taunted
him
with
his
low
extraction
he
had
caused
a
statue
of
a
divinity
to
be
made
out
of
a
gold
basin
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
wash
his
feet
and
he
had
exposed
it
to
the
adoration
of
the
faithful
when
it
had
been
worshipped
by
them
for
some
time
he
revealed
the
origin
of
the
idol
and
added
it
had
been
with
himself
as
with
the
if
he
were
a
private
person
formerly
yet
now
he
had
come
to
be
their
king
and
so
he
bade
them
honour
and
reverence
towards
the
middle
and
end
of
his
reign
he
was
as
much
detested
as
he
had
been
beloved
at
the
outset
he
had
notwithstanding
so
effectively
armed
egypt
that
the
persians
had
not
ventured
to
risk
a
collision
with
her
immediately
after
their
conquest
of
babylon
cyrus
had
spent
ten
years
in
compassing
the
downfall
of
nabonidus
and
calculating
that
that
of
amasis
would
require
no
less
a
period
of
time
he
set
methodically
to
work
on
the
organisation
of
his
recently
acquired
territory
the
cities
of
phoenicia
acknowledged
him
as
their
suzerain
and
furnished
him
with
what
had
hitherto
been
a
coveted
acquisition
a
fleet
these
preliminaries
had
apparently
been
already
accomplished
when
the
movements
of
the
barbarians
suddenly
made
his
presence
in
the
far
east
imperative
he
hurried
thither
and
was
mysteriously
lost
to
sight
tradition
accounts
for
his
death
in
several
ways
if
xenophon
is
to
be
credited
he
died
peaceably
on
his
bed
surrounded
by
his
children
and
edifying
those
present
by
his
wisdom
and
his
almost
superhuman
resignation
a
similar
legend
but
later
in
date
told
how
cyrus
when
a
hundred
years
old
asked
one
day
to
see
his
friends
he
was
told
that
his
son
had
had
them
all
put
to
death
his
grief
at
the
cruelty
of
cambyses
caused
his
death
in
a
few
days
berosus
tells
us
that
he
was
killed
in
a
campaign
against
the
daliæ

one
of
the
savage
tribes
of
bactriana
he
succumbed
to
his
injuries
three
days
after
the
engagement
according
to
the
worthy
herodotus
he
asked
the
hand
of
tomyris
queen
of
the
massagetse
in
marriage
and
was
refused
with
disdain
he
declared
war
against
her
to
avenge
his
wounded
vanity
set
out
to
fight
with
her
beyond
the
araxes
in
the
steppes
of
turkestan
defeated
the
of

and
took
prisoner
the
heir
to
the
crown

who
thereupon
ran
himself
through
with
his
sword
tomyris
collected
all
the
forces
of
her
kingdom
and
gave
him
cyrus
of
all
the
combats
in
which
barbarians
have
engaged
among
themselves
i
reckon
this
to
have
been
the
fiercest
the
following
as
i
understand
was
the
manner
of
it
first
the
two
armies
stood
apart
and
shot
their
arrows
at
each
other
then
when
their
quivers
were
empty
they
closed
and
fought
hand
to
hand
with
lances
and
daggers
and
thus
they
continued
fighting
for
a
length
of
time
neither
choosing
to
give
ground
at
length
the
massagetse
prevailed
the
greater
part
of
the
army
of
the
persians
was
destroyed
search
was
made
among
the
slain
by
order
of
the
queen
for
the
body
of
cyrus
and
when
it
was
found
she
took
a
skin
and
filling
it
full
of
human
blood
she
dipped
the
head
of
cyrus
in
the
gore
saying
as
she
thus
insulted
the
corse
live
and
have
conquered
thee
in
fight
and
yet
by
thee
am
i
ruined
for
thou
tookest
my
son
with
guile
but
thus
i
make
good
my
threat
and
give
thee
thy
fill
of
the
engagement
was
not
as
serious
as
the
legend
would
have
us
believe
and
the
growth
of
the
persian
power
was
in
no
way
affected
by
it
it
cost
cyrus
his
life
but
his
army
experienced
no
serious
disaster
and
his
men
took
the
body
and
brought
it
to
pasargadæ
he
had
a
palace
there
the
remains
of
which
can
still
be
seen

popular
imagination
drawing
on

inexhaustible
materials
furnished
by
his
adventurous
career
seemed
to
delight
in

him
the
ideal
of
all
a
monarch
should
be
they
attributed
to
him
every
virtue

justice
and
wisdom
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
he
possessed
the
qualities
of
a
good
general
activity
energy
and
courage
together
with
the
astuteness
and
the
duplicity
so
necessary
to
success
in
asiatic
conquest
but
he
does
not
appear
to
have
possessed
in
the
same
degree
the
gifts
of
a
great
administrator
he
made
no
changes
in
the
system
of
government
which
from
the
time
of
iii
onwards
had
obtained
among
all
oriental
sovereigns
he
placed
satraps
over
the
towns
and
countries
of
recent
acquisition
at
sardes
and
babylon
in
syria
and
palestine
but
without
clearly
defining
their
functions
or
subjecting
them
to
a
supervision
sufficiently
strict
to
ensure
the
faithful
performance
of
their
duties
he
believed
that
he
was
destined
to
found
a
single
empire
in
which
all
the
ancient
empires
were
to
be
merged
and
he
all
but
carried
his
task
to
a
successful
close
egypt
alone
remained
to
be
conquered
when
he
passed
away
his
wife
kassandanê
a
daughter
of
pharnaspes
and
an
achæmenian
like
himself
had
borne
him
five
children

sons
and

and
three
daughters
atossa
roxana
and
artystonê
the
persian
form
of
the
name
rendered
kambyses
by
the
greeks
was
kâbuzîyâ
or
kambuzîya
herodotus
calls
him
the
son
of
kassandanê
and
the
tradition
which
he
has
preserved
is
certainly
authentic
ctesias
has
erroneously
stated
that
his
mother
was
amytis
the
daughter
of
astyages
and
dinon
also
erroneously
the
egyptian
women
nitêtis
diodorus
siculus
and
strabo
make
him
the
son
of
meroê
the
original
form
was
bardiya
or
barzîya
laudable
and
the
first
greek
transcript
known
in
æschylus
is
mardos
or
in
the
scholiasts
on
the
passage
merdias
which
has
been
corrupted
into
marphios
by
hellanikos
and
into
merges
by
pompeius
trogus
the
form
smerdis
in
herodotus
and
in
the
historians
who
follow
him
is
the
result
of
a
mistaken
assimilation
of
the
persian
name
with
the
purely
greek
one
of
smerdis
or
smerdies
herodotus
says
that
atossa
was
the
daughter
of
kassandanê
and
the
position
which
she
held
during
three
reigns
shows
that
she
must
have
been
so
justi
however
calls
her
the
daughter
of
amytis
a
second
daughter
is
mentioned
by
herodotus
the
one
whom
cambyses
killed
in
egypt
by
a
kick
he
gives
her
no
name
but
she
is
probably
the
same
as
the
roxana
who
according
to
ctesias
bore
a
headless
child
the
youngest
artystonê
was
the
favourite
wife
of
darius
josephus
speaks
of
a
fourth
daughter
of
cyrus
called
meroê
but
without
saying
who
was
the
mother
of
this
princess
cambyses
was
probably
born
about
soon
after
his
accession
and
he
was
his
legitimate
successor
according
to
the
persian
custom
which
assigned
the
crown
to
the
eldest
of
the
sons
born
in
the
purple
he
had
been
associated
as
we
have
seen
in
the
babylonian
regal
power
immediately
after
the
victory
over
nabonidus
and
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
for
the
fatal
campaign
against
the
massagetse
his
father
again
in
accordance
with
the
persian
law
had
appointed
him
regent
a
later
tradition
preserved
by
ctesias
relates
that
on
this
occasion
the
territory
had
been
divided
between
the
two
sons
smerdis
here
called
tanyoxarkes
having
received
as
his
share
bactriana
the
khoramnians
the
parthians
and
the
carmanians
under
the
suzerainty
of
his
brother
cambyses
it
is
clear
inherited
the
whole
empire
but
intrigues
gathered
round
smerdis
and
revolts
broke
out
in
the
provinces
incited
so
it
was
said
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
by
his
partisans
the
new
king
was
possessed
of
a
violent
merciless
temper
and
the
persians
subsequently
emphasised
the
fact
by
saying
that
cyrus
had
been
a
father
to
them
cambyses
a
master
the
rebellions
were
repressed
with
a
vigorous
hand
and
finally
smerdis
disappeared
by
royal
order
and
the
secret
of
his
fate
was
so
well
kept
that
it
was
believed
even
by
his
mother
and
sisters
that
he
was
merely
imprisoned
in
some
obscure
median
fortress
herodotus
speaks
of
peoples
subdued
by
cambyses
in
asia
and
this
allusion
can
only
refer
to
a
revolt
occurring
after
the
death
of
cyrus
before
the
egyptian
expedition
these
troubles
are
explicitly
recorded
in
xenophon
the
inscription
of
behistun
says
distinctly
that
cambyses
had
his
brother
bardîya
put
to
death
before
the
egyptian
expedition
on
the
other
hand
herodotus
makes
the
murder
occur
during
the
egyptian
expedition
and
ctesias
after
this
expedition
version
of
the
affair
adds
that
cambyses
the
better
to
dissimulate
his
crime
ordered
the
murderer
sphendadates
to
pass
himself
off
as
tanyoxarkes
as
there
was
a
great
resemblance
between
the
two
sphendadates
the
historian
goes
on
to
say
was
exiled
to
bactriana
and
it
was
not
until
five
years
afterwards
that
the
mother
of
the
two
princes
heard
of
the
murder
and
of
the
substitution
these
additions
to
the
story
are
subsequent
developments
suggested
by
the
traditional
account
of
the
in
recent
times
several
authorities
have
expressed
the
opinion
that
all
that
is
told
us
of
the
murder
of
smerdis
and
about
the
is
merely
a
legend
invented
by
darius
or
those
about
him
in
order
to
justify
his
usurpation
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
the
would
be
smerdis
himself
who
revolted
against
cambyses
and
was
then
after
he
had
reigned
a
few
months
assassinated
by
darius
winckler
acknowledges
certainty
is
impossible
in
such
a
case
and
in
reality
all
ancient
tradition
is
against
his
hypothesis
and
it
is
best
to
accept
account
with
all
its
contradictions
until
contemporaneous
documents
enable
us
to
decide
what
to
accept
and
what
to
reject
in
it
the
ground
being
cleared
of
his
rival
and
affairs
on
the
scythian
frontier
reduced
to
order
cambyses
took
up
the
projects
against
egypt
at
the
exact
point
at
which
his
predecessor
had
left
them
amasis
who
for
ten
years
had
been
expecting
an
attack
had
taken
every
precaution
in
his
power
against
it
and
had
once
more
patiently
begun
to
make
overtures
of
alliance
with
the
hellenic
cities
those
on
the
european
continent
did
not
feel
themselves
so
seriously
menaced
as
to
consider
it
to
their
interest
to
furnish
him
with
any
assistance
but
the
greeks
of
the
independent
islands
with
their
chief
poly
crates
tyrant
of
samos
received
his
advances
with
alacrity
polycrates
had
at
his
disposal
a
considerable
fleet
the
finest
hitherto
seen
in
the
waters
of
the
ægean
and
this
combined
with
the
egyptian
navy
was
not
any
too
large
a
force
to
protect
the
coasts
of
the
delta
now
that
the
persians
had
at
their
disposition
not
only
the
vessels
of
the
æolian
and
ionian
cities
but
those
of
phoenicia
and
cyprus
a
treaty
was
concluded
bringing
about
an
exchange
of
presents
and
amenities
between
the
two
princes
which
lasted
as
long
as
peace
prevailed
but
was
ruptured
at
the
critical
moment
by
the
action
of
polycrates
though
not
actually
through
his
own
fault
the
aristocratic
party
whose
chiefs
were
always
secretly
plotting
his
overthrow
had
given
their
adherence
to
the
persians
and
their
conduct
became
so
threatening
about
the
time
of
the
death
of
cyras
that
polycrates
had
to
break
his
engagements
with
egypt
in
order
to
avert
a
catastrophe
herodotus
laid
the
blame
for
the
breach
of
the
treaty
to
the
king
of
egypt
and
attributed
to
his
fear
of
the
constant
good
fortune
of
polycrates
the
accession
to
power
is
fixed
at
about
the
year
by
some
by
others
in
the
year
or
in
the
year
his
negotiations
with
amasis
must
be
placed
somewhere
during
the
last
fifteen
years
of
the
pharaoh
he
made
a
treaty
with
the
persian
king
and
sent
a
squadron
of
forty
galleys
to
join
the
fleet
then
being
equipped
in
the
phoenician
ports
herodotus
records
two
opposing
traditions
one
that
the
samians
joined
in
the
egyptian
campaign
the
other
that
they
went
only
as
far
as
the
neighbourhood
of
karpathos
amasis
therefore
when
war
at
last
broke
out
found
himself
left
to
face
the
enemy
alone
the
struggle
was
inevitable
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
eastern
coasts
of
the
mediterranean
had
long
foreseen
its
coming
without
taking
into
consideration
the
danger
to
which
the
persian
empire
and
its
syrian
provinces
were
exposed
by
the
proximity
of
a
strong
and
able
power
such
as
egypt
the
hardy
and
warlike
character
of
cambyses
would
naturally
have
prompted
him
to
make
an
attempt
to
achieve
what
his
predecessors
the
of
nineveh
and
babylon
had
always
failed
to
accomplish
successfully
policy
ruled
his
line
of
action
and
was
sufficient
to
explain
it
but
popular
imagination
sought
other
than
the
very
natural
causes
which
had
brought
the
most
ancient
and
most
recent
of
the
great
empires
of
the
world
into
opposition
romantic
reasons
were
therefore
invented
to
account
for
the
great
drama
which
was
being
enacted
and
the
details
supplied
varied
considerably
according
as
the
tradition
was
current
in
asia
or
africa
it
was
said
that
a
physician
lent
to
cyrus
by
amasis
to
treat
him
for
an
affection
of
the
eyes
was
the
cause
of
all
the
evil
the
unfortunate
man
detained
at
susa
and
chafing
at
his
exile
was
said
to
have
advised
cambyses
to
ask
for
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
in
marriage
hoping
either
that
amasis
would
grant
the
request
and
be
dishonoured
in
the
eyes
of
his
subjects
for
having
degraded
the
solar
race
by
a
union
with
a
barbarian
or
that
he
would
boldly
refuse
and
thus
arouse
the
hatred
of
the
persians
against
himself
amasis
after
a
slight
hesitation
substituted
nitêtis
a
daughter
of
apries
for
his
own
child
it
happened
that
one
day
in
sport
cambyses
addressed
the
princess
by
the
name
of
her
supposed
father
whereupon
she
said
perceive
o
king
that
you
have
no
suspicion
of
the
way
in
which
you
have
been
deceived
by
amasis
he
took
me
and
having
dressed
me
up
as
his
own
daughter
sent
me
to
you
in
reality
i
am
the
daughter
of
apries
who
was
his
lord
and
master
until
the
day
that
he
revolted
and
in
concert
with
the
rest
of
the
egyptians
put
his
sovereign
to
the
deceit
which
cambyses
thus
discovered
had
been
put
upon
him
irritated
him
so
greatly
as
to
induce
him
to
turn
his
arms
against
egypt
so
ran
the
persian
account
of
the
tale
but
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
matters
were
explained
otherwise
here
it
was
said
that
it
was
to
cyrus
himself
that
nitêtis
had
been
married
and
that
she
had
borne
cambyses
to
him
the
conquest
had
thus
been
merely
a
revenge
of
the
legitimate
heirs
of
psammetichus
upon
the
usurper
and
cambyses
had
ascended
the
throne
less
as
a
conqueror
than
as
a
pharaoh
of
the
line
of
apries
it
was
by
this
childish
fiction
that
the
egyptians
in
their
decadence
consoled
themselves
before
the
stranger
for
their
loss
of
power
always
proud
of
their
ancient
prowess
but
incapable
of
imitating
the
deeds
of
their
forefathers
they
none
the
less
pretended
that
they
could
neither
be
vanquished
nor
ruled
except
by
one
of
themselves
and
the
story
of
nitêtis
afforded
complete
satisfaction
to
their
vanity
if
cambyses
were
born
of
a
solar
princess
persia
could
not
be
said
to
have
imposed
a
barbarian
king
upon
egypt
but
on
the
contrary
that
egypt
had
cleverly
foisted
her
pharaoh
upon
persia
and
through
persia
upon
half
the
universe
one
obstacle
still
separated
the
two
foes
the
desert
and
the
marshes
of
the
delta
the
distance
between
the
outposts
of
pelusium
and
the
fortress
of
on
the
syrian
frontier
was
scarcely
miles
and
could
be
crossed
by
an
army
in
less
than
ten
days
formerly
the
width
of
this
strip
of
desert
had
been
less
but
the
assyrians
and
after
them
the
chaldæans
had
vied
with
each
other
in
laying
waste
the
country
and
the
absence
of
any
settled
population
now
rendered
the
transit
difficult
cambyses
had
his
at
gaza
at
the
extreme
limit
of
his
own
dominions
but
he
was
at
a
loss
how
to
face
this
solitary
region
without
incurring
the
risk
of
seeing
half
his
men
buried
beneath
its
sands
and
his
uncertainty
was
delaying
his
departure
when
a
stroke
of
fortune
relieved
him
from
his
difficulty
the
ænysos
of
herodotus

now
khân

kattiyeh
on
the
of

was
at

on
the
of
ventose
after
remaining
from
the
to
the
of
pluviôse
before
arîsh
besieging
that
place
this
seems
to
follow
from
the
tradition
according
to
which
cambyses
left
his
treasures
at
gaza
during
the
egyptian
campaign
and
the
town
was
thence
called
the
etymology
is
false
but
the
fact
that
suggested
it
is
probably
correct
considering
the
situation
of
gaza
and
the
part
it
must
necessarily
play
in
an
invasion
of
egypt
phanes
of
halicarnassus
one
of
the
mercenaries
in
the
service
of
egypt
a
man
of
shrewd
judgment
and
an
able
soldier
fell
out
with
amasis
for
some
unknown
reason
and
left
him
to
offer
his
services
to
his
rival
this
was
a
serious
loss
for
egypt
since
phanes
possessed
considerable
authority
over
the
mercenaries
and
was
better
versed
in
egyptian
affairs
than
any
other
person
he
was
pursued
and
taken
within
sight
of
the
lycian
coast
but
he
treated
his
captors
to
wine
and
escaped
from
them
while
they
were
intoxicated
he
placed
cambyses
in
communication
with
the
shêkh
of
the
scattered
tribes
between
syria
and
the
delta
the

to
furnish

his
predecessors

done

years

of

with
water
along
the
route
that
the
invading
army
was
to
follow

taken
these
precautions
cambyses
entrusted
the
cares
of
government
and
the
regulation
of
his
household
to
oropastes

of

a
variant

is
quite
correct

it

admitted
that

inverted

by

for

doubtless
several

have
made

gives
the

and
he
had
an
account
of
the
history
of
the
conquest
entirely
different
from
that
of
herodotus
egypt
was
threatened
not
only
as
in
the
previous
century
by
the
nations
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
but
all
asia
from
the
indus
to
the

was
about
to
fall
on
her
to
crush
her
she
was
destitute
of

only
twice

three
times
in

but
a
few
days
after
the
accession
of
psammetichus
a
shower
of
fine
rain
fell
at

an
event
so
it
was
stated
with
the
exaggeration
characteristic
of
the
bearers
of

news
which
had
never
before
occurred
the
inhabitants
of
the
said
have
up
to
our
own

always
considered
rain
in
the

as
an
event
they
used
to
say
in
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
speaking
of
expedition
knew
that
misfortune
threatened
us
because
it
rained
at
luxor
shortly
before
the
french
wilkinson
assures

that

is
not
so
rare
at

thought
he
speaks
of
five
or
six
showers
a

of
a
great
storm
on
an
average
every
ten
years
but
even
he
admits
that
it
is
confined
to
the

does
not

never

together
with
his
libyan
and

auxiliaries
and
the
ionians
carians
and
greeks
of
the
isles
and
mainland
the
battle
took
place
before
pelusium
and
was
fought
on
both
sides
with
brave
desperation
since
defeat
meant
servitude
for
the
egyptians
and
for
the
persians
cut
off
by
the
desert
from
possible
retreat
captivity
or
annihilation
phanes
had
been
obliged
to
leave
his
children
behind
him
and
pharaoh
included
them
in
his
suite
to
serve
if
needful
as
hostages
the
carians
and
ionians
who
felt
themselves
disgraced
by
the
defection
of
their
captain
called
loudly
for
them
just
before
the
commencement
of
the
action
they
were
killed
immediately
in
front
of
the
lines
their
father
being
a
powerless
onlooker
their
blood
was
thrown
into
a
cask
half
full
of
wine
and
the
horrible
mixture
was
drunk
by
the
soldiers
who
then
furiously
charged
the
battalions
the
issue
of
the
struggle
was
for
a
long
time
doubtful
but
the
egyptians
were
inferior
in
numbers
towards
evening
their
lines
gave
way
and
the
flight
began
all
was
not
however
lost
if
psammetichus
had
but
followed
the
example
of
taharqa
and
defended
the
passage
of
the
various
canals
and
arms
of
the
river
disputing
the
ground
inch
by
inch
with
the
persians
and
gaining
time
meanwhile
to
collect
a
fresh
army
the
king
lost
his
presence
of
mind
and
without
attempting
to
rally
what
remained
of
his
regiments
he
hastened
to
take
refuge
within
the
white
wall
cambyses
halted
a
few
days
to
reduce
pelusium
and
in
the
mean
time
sent
a
vessel
of
mitylene
to
summon
memphis
to
capitulate
the
infuriated
populace
as
soon
as
they
got
wind
of
the
message
massacred
the
herald
and
the
crew
and
dragged
their
bleeding
limbs
through
the
streets
according
to
herodotus
eighty
years
later
the
field
used
to
be
shown
covered
with
bones
and
it
was
said
that
the
egyptians
could
be
distinguished
from
the
persians
by
the
relative
hardness
of
their
skulls
polysenus
hands
down
a
story
that
cambyses
in
order
to
paralyse
the
resistance
of
the
besieged
caused
cats
dogs
ibises
and
other
sacred
animals
to
march
at
the
head
of
his
attacking
columns
the
egyptians
would
not
venture
to
use
their
arms
for
fear
of
wounding
or
killing
some
of
their
gods
the
city
held
out
for
a
considerable
time
when
at
length
she
opened
her
gates
the
remaining
inhabitants
of
the
said
who
had
hesitated
up
to
then
hastened
to
make
their
submission
and
the
whole
of
egypt
as
far
as
philae
became
at
one
stroke
a
persian
province
the
libyans
did
not
wait
to
be
summoned
to
bring
their
tribute
cyrene
and
barca
followed
their
example
but
their
offerings
were
so
small
that
the
irritation
was
aroused
and
deeming
himself
mocked
he
gave
way
to
his
anger
and
instead
of
accepting
them
he
threw
them
to
his
soldiers
with
his
own
hand
the
question
as
to
the
year
in
which
egypt
was
subdued
by
cambyses
has
long
divided
historians
i
still
agree
with
those
who
place
the
conquest
in
the
spring
of
this
sudden
collapse
of
a
power
whose
exalted
position
had
defied
all
attacks
for
centuries
and
the
tragic
fate
of
the
king
who
had
received
his
crown
merely
to
lose
it
filled
contemporary
beholders
with
astonishment
and
pity
it
was
said
that
ten
days
after
the
capitulation
of
memphis
the
victorious
king
desired
out
of
sport
to
test
the
endurance
of
his
prisoner
psammetichus
beheld
his
daughter
and
the
daughters
of
his
nobles
pass
before
him
half
naked
with
jars
on
their
shoulders
and
go
down
to
the
nile
to
fetch
water
from
the
river
like
common
slaves
his
son
and
two
thousand
young
men
of
the
same
age
in
chains
and
with
ropes
round
their
necks
also
defiled
before
him
on
their
way
to
die
as
a
revenge
for
the
murder
of
the
mitylenians
yet
he
never
for
a
moment
lost
his
royal
imperturbability
but
when
one
of
his
former
companions
in
pleasure
chanced
to
pass
begging
for
alms
and
clothed
in
rags
psammetichus
suddenly
broke
out
into
weeping
and
lacerated
his
face
in
despair
cambyses
surprised
at
this
excessive
grief
in
a
man
who
up
till
then
had
exhibited
such
fortitude
demanded
the
reason
of
his
conduct
of
cyrus
he
replied
misfortunes
of
my
house
are
too
unparalleled
to
weep
over
but
not
the
affliction
of
my
friend
when
a
man
on
the
verge
of
old
age
falls
from
luxury
and
abundance
into
extreme
poverty
one
may
well
lament
his
when
the
speech
was
reported
to
cambyses
he
fully
recognised
the
truth
of
it
croesus
who
was
also
present
shed
tears
and
the
persians
round
him
were
moved
with
pity
cambyses
likewise
touched
commanded
that
the
son
of
the
pharaoh
should
be
saved
but
the
remission
of
the
sentence
arrived
too
late
he
at
all
events
treated
pharaoh
himself
with
consideration
and
it
is
possible
that
he
might
have
replaced
him
on
the
throne
under
an
oath
of
vassalage
had
he
not
surprised
him
in
a
conspiracy
against
his
own
life
he
thereupon
obliged
him
to
poison
himself
by
drinking
blood
and
he
confided
the
government
of
the
nile
valley
to
a
persian
named
aryandes
no
part
of
the
ancient
world
now
remained
unconquered
except
the
kingdom
of
ethiopia
in
the
south
cities
and
monarchies
all
the
great
actors
of
early
times
had
been
laid
in
the
dust
one
after
another
tyre
damascus
carchemish
urartu
elam
assyria
jerusalem
media
the
lydians
babylon
and
finally
egypt
and
the
prey
they
had
fought
over
so
fiercely
and
for
so
many
centuries
now
belonged
in
its
entirety
to
one
master
for
the
first
time
as
far
as
memory
could
reach
back
into
the
past
cambyses
following
in
the
footsteps
of
cyrus
had
pursued
his
victorious
way
successfully
but
it
was
another
matter
to
consolidate
his
conquests
and
to
succeed
in
governing
within
the
limits
of
one
empire
so
many
incongruous
elements
the
people
of
the
caucasus
and
those
of
the
nile
valley
the
greeks
of
the
ægean
and
the
iranians
the
scythians
from
beyond
the
oxus
and
the
semites
of
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
or
of
the
mediterranean
coast
and
time
alone
would
show
whether
this
heritage
would
not
fall
to
pieces
as
quickly
as
it
had
been
built
up
the
asiatic
elements
of
the
empire
appeared
at
all
events
for
the
moment
content
with
their
lot
and
babylon
showed
herself
more
than
usually
resigned
but
egypt
had
never
accepted
the
yoke
of
the
stranger
willingly
and
the
most
fortunate
of
her
assyrian
conquerors
had
never
exercised
more
than
a
passing
supremacy
over
her
cambyses
realised
that
he
would
never
master
her
except
by
governing
her
himself
for
a
period
of
several
years
and
by
making
himself
as
egyptian
as
a
persian
could
be
without
offending
his
own
subjects
at
home
he
adopted
the
titles
of
the
pharaohs
their
double
cartouche
their
royal
costume
and
their
solar
filiation
as
much
to
satisfy
his
own
personal
animosity
as
to
conciliate
the
egyptian
priests
he
repaired
to
sais
violated
the
tomb
of
amasis
and
burnt
the
mummy
after
offering
it
every
insult
herodotus
gives
also
a
second
account
which
declares
that
cambyses
thus
treated
the
body
not
of
amasis
but
of
some
unknown
person
whom
he
took
for
amasis
the
truth
of
the
story
is
generally
contested
for
the
deed
would
have
been
as
herodotus
himself
remarks
contrary
to
persian
ideas
about
the
sanctity
of
fire
i
think
that
by
his
cruel
treatment
of
the
mummy
cambyses
wished
to
satisfy
the
hatred
of
the
natives
against
the
king
and
so
render
himself
more
acceptable
to
them
the
destruction
of
the
mummy
entailing
that
of
the
soul
his
act
gave
the
saitic
population
a
satisfaction
similar
to
that
experienced
by
the
refined
cruelty
of
those
who
a
few
centuries
ago
killed
their
enemies
when
in
a
state
of
deadly
sin
and
so
ensure
not
only
their
dismissal
from
this
world
but
also
their
condemnation
in
the
next
illustration
the
naophoros
statuette
of
the
vatican
drawn
by
from
a
photograph
the
head
and
hands
are
a
restoration
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
most
inappropriate
style
he
removed
his
troops
from
the
temple
of
nît
which
they
had
turned
into
a
barrack
to
the
horror
of
the
faithful
and
restored
at
his
own
expense
the
damage
they
had
done
to
the
building
he
condescended
so
far
as
to
receive
instruction
in
the
local
religion
and
was
initiated
in
the
worship
of
the
goddess
by
the
priest
uzaharrîsnîti
this
was
after
all
a
pursuance
of
the
policy
employed
by
his
father
towards
the
babylonians
and
the
projects
which
he
had
in
view
necessitated

of
the
people

costs

no
more
to
offer
him
two
almost
untried

lay
open
to
his
ambition
africa
and
europe
the
greek
world
and
what
lay
beyond
it
the
carthaginian
world
and
ethiopia
the
necessity
of
making
a
final
reckoning
with
egypt
had
at
the
outset
summoned
him
to
africa
and
it
was
therefore
in
that
continent
that
he
determined
to
carry
on
his
conquests
memphis
was
necessarily
the
base
of
his
operations
the
only
point
from
which
he
could
direct
the
march
of
his
armies
in
a
westerly
or
southerly
direction
and
at
the
same
time
keep
in
touch
with
the
rest
of
his
empire
and
he
would
indeed
have
been
imprudent
had
he
neglected
anything
which
could
make
him
acceptable
to
its
inhabitants
as
soon
as
he
felt
he
had
gained
their
sympathies
he
despatched
two
expeditions
one
to
carthage
and
one
to
ethiopia
cyrene
had
spontaneously
offered
him
her
homage
he
now
further
secured
it
by
sending
thither
with
all
honour
ladikê
the
widow
of
amasis
and
he
apparently
contemplated
taking
advantage
of
the
good
will
of
the
cyrenians
to
approach
carthage
by
sea
the
combined
fleets
of
ionia
and
phonicia
were
without
doubt
numerically
sufficient
for
this
undertaking
but
the
tyrians
refused
to
serve
against
their
own
colonies
and
he
did
not
venture
to
employ
the
greeks
alone
in
waters
which
were
unfamiliar
to
them
besides
this
the
information
which
he
obtained
from
those
about
him
convinced
him
that
the
overland
route
would
enable
him
to
reach
his
destination
more
surely
if
more
slowly
it
would
lead
him
from
the
banks
of
the
nile
to
the
oases
of
the
theban
desert
from
there
to
the
ammonians
and
thence
by
way
of
the
libyans
bordering
on
the
syrtes

the

despatched
an
of
fifty
thousand

make
him

about

enter
on
a
struggle
with
a
nation

rather
than

was
informed

was

inclined
rather
to
believe
the
story
to
be
a
recollection
partly
of
the
actual
custom
of
placing
meats
which
the
first
comer
might
take
on
the
tombs
in

necropolis
partly
of
the
mythical
of
mentioned

which
the
souls
of
the
dead
and
the
gods
alike
had
access

region
would
have
transferred
to
our
earth

some
like
the

of

the

other
similar
beliefs

it

purposes

for
the
chains
of
their
prisoners
but
on
the
other
hand
copper
was
rare

prized
canibyses

from

to
explore
this
region
and
acting
on
the
report
they
brought
back
he
left

the
head
of

army
and
a
fleet
the
expedition
was
partly
a
success
and
partly
a
failure
it
followed
the
nile
valley
as
far
as
korosko
and
then
struck
across
the
desert
in
the
direction
of
napata
but
provisions
ran
short
before
a
quarter
of
the
march
had
been
achieved
and
famine
obliged
the
invaders
to
retrace
their
steps
after
having
endured
terrible
sufferings
text
speaks
of
an
army
only
but
the
accounts
of
the
wars
between
ethiopia
and
egypt
show
that
the
army
was
always
accompanied
by
the
necessary
fleet
it
is
usually
thought
that
the
expedition
marched
by
the
side
of
the
nile
as
far
as
napata
to
support
this
theory
the
name
of
a
place
mentioned
in
pliny
is
quoted
cambusis
at
the
third
cataract
which
is
supposed
to
contain
the
name
of
the
conqueror
this
town
which
is
sometimes
mentioned
by
the
classical
geographers
is
called
kambiusit
in
the
ethiopie
texts
and
the
form
of
the
name
makes
its
connection
with
the
history
of
cambyses
easy
i
think
it
follows
from
the
text
of
herodotus
that
the
persians
left
the
grassy
land
the
at
a
given
moment
to
enter
the
sand
the
desert
now
this
is
done
at
two
points
near
korosko
to
rejoin
the
nile
at
and
near
to
avoid
the
part
of
the
nile
called
the
belly
batn
the
korosko
route
being
the
only
one
suitable
for
the
transit
of
a
body
of
troops
and
also
the
only
route
known
to
herodotus
seems
i
think
likely
to
be
the
one
which
was
followed
in
the
present
instance
at
all
events
it
fits
in
best
with
the
fact
that
cambyses
was
obliged
to
retrace
his
steps
hurriedly
when
he
had
accomplished
hardly
a
fifth
of
the
journey
many
modern
historians
are
inclined
to
assume
that
expedition
was
completely
successful
and
that
its
result
was
the
overthrow
of
the
ancient
kingdom
of
nepata
and
the
foundation
of
that
of
meroê
cambyses
would
have
given
the
new
town
which
he
built
there
the
name
of
his
sister
meroê
the
traditions
concerning
cambusis
and
meroê
belong
to
the
alexandrine
era
and
rest
only
on
chance
similarities
of
sound
with
regard
to
the
ethiopian
province
of
the
persian
empire
and
to
the
ethiopian
neighbours
of
egypt
whom
cambyses
subdued
the
latter
are
not
necessarily
ethiopians
of
napata
herodotus
himself
says
that
the
ethiopians
dwelt
in
the
country
above
elephantine
and
that
half
of
what
he
calls
the
island
of
takhompsô
was
inhabited
by
ethiopians
the
subjugated
ethiopians
and
their
country
plainly
correspond
with
the
dodekaschênos
of
the
era
cambyses
had
to
rest
content
with
the
acquisition
of
those
portions
of
nubia
adjoining
the
first
cataract
the
same
in
fact
that
had
been
annexed
to
egypt
by
psammetichus
and
ii
the
failure
of
this
expedition
to
the
south
following
so
closely
on
the
disaster
which
befell
that
of
the
west
had
a
deplorable
effect
on
the
mind
of
cambyses
he
had
been
subject
from
childhood
to
attacks
of
epilepsy
during
which
he
became
a
maniac
and
had
no
control
over
his
actions
these
reverses
of
fortune
aggravated
the
disease
and
increased
the
frequency
and
length
of
the
attacks
recent
historians
admit
neither
the
reality
of
the
illness
of
cambyses
nor
the
madness
resulting
from
it
but
consider
them
egyptian
fables
invented
out
of
spite
towards
the
king
who
had
conquered
and
persecuted
them
the
bull
apis
had
died
shortly
before
the
close
of
the
ethiopian
campaign
and
the
egyptians
after
mourning
for
him
during
the
prescribed
number
of
weeks
were
bringing
his
successor
with
rejoicings
into
the
temple
of
phtah
when
the
remains
of
the
army
memphis
cambyses
finding
the
city
imagined
that
it
was
rejoicing
over
his
misfortunes
he
summoned
the
magistrates
before
him
and
gave
them
over
to
the
executioner
without
deigning
to
listen
to
their
explanations
he
next
caused
the
priests
to
be
brought
to
him
and
when
they
had
paraded
the
apis
before
him
he
plunged
his
dagger
into
its
flank
with
derisive
laughter
evil
people
so
you
make
for
yourselves
divinities
of
flesh
and
blood
which
fear
the
sword
it
is
indeed
a
fine
god
that
you
egyptians
have
here
i
will
have
you
to
know
however
that
you
shall
not
rejoice
overmuch
at
having
deceived
me
the
priests
were
beaten
as
impostors
and
the
bull
languished
from
its
wound
and
died
in
a
few
its
priests
buried
it
and
chose
another
in
its
place
without
the
usual
ceremonies
so
as
not
to
exasperate
the
anger
of
the
tyrant
but
the
horror
evoked
by
this
double
sacrilege
raised
passions
against
cambyses
which
the
ruin
of
the
country
had
failed
to
excite
later
historians
improved
upon
the
account
of
herodotus
and
it
is
said
in
the
that
cambyses
killed
the
apis
and
threw
him
to
the
dogs
here
there
is
probably
a
confusion
between
the
conduct
of
cambyses
and
that
attributed
to
the
eunuch
bagoas
nearly
two
centuries
later
at
the
time
of
the
second
conquest
of
egypt
by
ochus
mariette
discovered
in
the
serapseum
and
sent
to
the
louvre
fragments
of
the
epitaph
of
an
apis
buried
in
epiphi
in
the
sixth
year
of
cambyses
which
had
therefore
died
a
few
months
previously
this
fact
contradicts
the
inference
from
the
epitaph
of
the
apis
that
died
in
the
fourth
year
of
darius
which
would
have
been
born
in
the
fifth
year
of
cambyses
if
we
allow
that
there
could
not
have
been
two
apises
in
egypt
at
once
this
was
indeed
the
usual
rule
but
a
comparison
of
the
two
dates
shows
that
here
it
was
not
followed
and
it
is
therefore
simplest
until
we
have
further
evidence
to
conclude
that
at
all
events
in
cases
of
violence
such
as
sacrilegious
murder
there
could
have
been
two
apises
at
once
one
discharging
his
functions
and
the
other
unknown
living
still
in
the
midst
of
the
herds
the
manifestations
of
this
antipathy
irritated
him
to
such
an
extent
that
he
completely
changed
his
policy
and
set
himself
from
that
time
forward
to
act
counter
to
the
customs
and
prejudices
of
the
egyptians
they
consequently
regarded
his
memory
with
a
vindictive
hatred
the
people
related
that
the
gods
had
struck
him
with
madness
to
avenge
the
murder
of
the
apis
and
they
attributed
to
him
numberless
traits
of
senseless
cruelty
in
which
we
can
scarcely
distinguish
truth
from
fiction
it
was
said
that
having
entered
the
temple
of
phtah
he
had
ridiculed
the
grotesque
figure
under
which
the
god
was
represented
and
had
commanded
the
statues
to
be
burnt
on
another
occasion
he
had
ordered
the
ancient
sepulchres
to
be
opened
that
he
might
see
what
was
the
appearance
of
the
mummies
the
most
faithful
members
of
his
family
and
household
it
was
said
did
not
escape
his
fury
he
killed
his
own
sister
roxana
whom
he
had
married
by
a
kick
in
the
abdomen
he
slew
the
son
of
prexaspes
with
an
arrow
he
buried
alive
twelve
influential
persians
he
condemned
croesus
to
death
and
then
repented

who
had
failed
to
execute

sentence

against

this
story
of
croesus
is
entirely
fabulous
he
had
no
longer
any
reason
for
remaining
in
egypt
since
he
had
failed
in
his
undertakings
yet
he
did
not
quit
the
country
and
through
repeated
delays
his
departure
was
retarded
a
whole
year
meanwhile
his
long
sojourn
in
africa
the
report
of
his
failures
and
perhaps
whispers
of
his
insanity
had
sown
the
seeds
of
discontent
in
asia
and
as
darius
said
in
when
recounting
these
events
had
spread
all
over
the
country
not
only
in
persia
and
media
but
in
other
cambyses
himself
felt
that
a
longer
absence
would
be
injurious
to
his
interests
he
therefore
crossed
the
isthmus
in
the
spring
of
and
was
making
his
way
through
northern
syria
perhaps
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hamath
when
he
learned
that
a
revolution
had
broken
out
and
that
its
rapid
progress
threatened
the
safety
of
his
throne
and
life
herodotus
calls
the
place
where
cambyses
died
agbatana
ecbatana
pliny
says
that
the
town
of
carmel
was
thus
named
at
first
but
the
place
here
mentioned
can
not
well
have
been
in
that
direction
it
has
been
identified
with
batansea
in
the
country
between
the
orontes
and
the
euphrates
but
the
most
likely
theory
is
the
one
suggested
by
a
passage
in
stephen
of
byzantium
that
the
place
in
question
is
the
large
syrian
city
of
hamath
josephus
makes
him
die
at
damascus
tradition
asserted
that
a
herald
appeared
before
him
and
proclaimed
aloud
in
the
hearing
of
the
whole
army
that
cambyses
son
of
cyrus
had
ceased
to
reign
and
summoned
whoever
had
till
that
day
obeyed
him
to
acknowledge
henceforth
smerdis
son
of
cyrus
as
their
lord
cambyses
at
first
believed
that
his
brother
had
been
spared
by
the
assassins
and
now
after
years
of
concealment
had
at
length
declared
himself
but
he
soon
received
proofs
that
his
orders
had
been
faithfully
accomplished
and
it
is
said
that
he
wept
at
the
remembrance
of
the
fruitless
crime
the
usurper
was
gaumâta
one
of
the
persian
magi
whose
resemblance
to
smerdis
was
so
remarkable
that
even
those
who
were
cognisant
of
it
invariably
mistook
the
one
for
the
other
and
he
was
brother
to
that
oropastes
to
whom
cambyses
had
entrusted
the
administration
of
his
household
before
setting
out
for
egypt
greek
tradition
is
unanimous
on
this
point
but
the
inscription
of
behistun
does
not
mention
it
the
inscription
of
behistun
informs
us
that
the
name
was
gaumâta
pompeius
trogus
alone
probably
following
some
author
who
made
use
of
charon
of
lampsacus
handed
down
this
name
in
the
form
comètes
or
gometes
which
his
abbreviator
justin
carelessly
applied
to
the
second
brother
ctesias
gives
the
mage
the
name
sphendadates
which
answers
to
the
old
persian
spentôdâta
who
is
given
by
the
holy
one
by
the
supporters
of
the
mage
gave
him
this
name
as
an
heroic
champion
of
the
mazdoan
faith
who
had
destroyed
such
sanctuaries
as
were
illegal
and
identified
him
with
spentôdâta
son
of
wistâspa
both
of
them
were
aware
of
the
fate
of
smerdis
they
also
knew
that
the
persians
were
ignorant
of
it
and
that
every
one
at
court
including
the
mother
and
sisters
of
the
prince
believed
that
he
was
still
alive
gaumâta
headed
a
revolt
in
the
little
town
of
pasyauvadâ
on
the
of
viyakhna
in
the
early
days
of
march
and
he
was
hailed
by
the
common
people
from
the
moment
of
his
appearance
persia
media
and
the
iranian
provinces
pronounced
in
his
favour
and
solemnly
enthroned
him
three
months
later
on
the
of
garmapada
babylon
next
accepted
him
followed
by
elam
and
the
regions
of
the
tigris
though
astounded
at
first
by
such
a
widespread
defection
cambyses
soon
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
and
was
about
to
march
forward
at
the
head
of
the
troops
who
were
still
loyal
to
him
when
he
mysteriously
disappeared
whether
he
was
the
victim
of
a
plot
set
on
foot
by
those
about
him
is
not
known
the
official
version
of
the
story
given
by
darius
states
that
he
died
by
his
own
hand
and
it
seems
to
insinuate
that
it
was
a
voluntary
act
but
another
account
affirms
that
he
succumbed
to
an
accident
while
mounting
his
horse
the
point
of
his
dagger
pierced
his
thigh
in
the
same
spot
in
which
he
had
stabbed
the
apis
of
the
egyptians
feeling
himself
seriously
wounded
he
suddenly
asked
the
name
of
the
place
where
he
was
lying
and
was
told
it
was
ecbatana
long
before
this
the
oracle
of
buto
had
predicted
that
he
should
end
his
days
in
agbatana
and
he
believing
it
to
be
the
agbatana
in
media
where
were
his
treasures
understood
that
he
should
die
there
in
his
old
age
whereas
the
oracle
meant
agbatana
in
syria
when
he
heard
the
name
he
perceived
his
error
he
understood
what
the
god
intended
and
cried
is
here
then
that
cambyses
son
of
cyrus
must
perish
he
expired
about
three
weeks
after
leaving
no
posterity
and
having
appointed
no
successor
it
has
been
pointed
out
for
the
purpose
of
harmonising
the
testimony
of
herodotus
with
that
of
the
inscription
of
behistun
that
although
the
latter
speaks
of
the
death
of
cambyses
by
his
own
hand
it
does
not
say
whether
that
death
was
voluntary
or
accidental
the
story
of
a
person
whose
death
has
been
predicted
to
take
place
in
some
place
and
who
has
died
in
some
obscure
spot
of
the
same
name
occurs
several
times
in
different
historians
in
the
account
of
the
emperor
julian
and
in
that
of
henry
iii
of
england
who
had
been
told
that
he
would
die
in
jerusalem
and
whose
death
took
place
in
the
jerusalem
chamber
at
westminster
ctesias
has
preserved
an
altogether
different
tradition
that
cambyses
on
his
return
from
babylon
wounded
himself
while
carving
a
piece
of
wood
for
his
amusement
and
died
eleven
days
after
the
accident
what
took
place
in
the
ensuing
months
still
remains
an
enigma
to
us
the
episode
of
gaumâta
has
often
been
looked
on
as
a
national
movement
which
momentarily
restored
to
the
medes
the
supremacy
of
which
cyrus
had
robbed
them
but
it
was
nothing
of
the
sort
gaumâta
was
not
a
mede
by
birth
he
was
a
persian
born
in
persia
in
the
township
of
pisyauvadâ
at
the
foot
of
mount
and
the
persians
recognised
and
supported
him
as
much
as
did
the
medes
it
has
also
been
thought
that
he
had
attempted
to
foment
a
religious
revolution
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
destroyed
several
temples
in
a
few
months
most
of
the
ancient
writers
shared
this
opinion
and
have
been
followed
therein
by
many
modern
writers
rawlinson
was
the
first
to
show
that
movement
was
not
median
and
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
alter
the
position
of
the
persians
in
the
empire
but
he
allows
the
magian
usurpation
to
have
been
the
prelude
to
a
sort
of
religious
reform
here
however
the
reform
touched
less
upon
a
question
of
belief
than
on
one
of
fact
the
unity
of
the
empire
presupposed
the
unity
of
the
royal
fire
and
that
fire
was
burning
another
could
not
be
lighted
without
sacrilege
in
the
eyes
of
the
faithful
the
pyres
that
gaumâta
desired
to
extinguish
were
no
doubt
those
which
the
feudal
families
had
maintained
for
their
separate
use
in
defiance
of
the
law
and
the
measure
which
abolished
them
had
a
political
as
well
as
a
religious
side
the
little
we
can
glean
of
the
line
of
action
adopted
by
smerdis
does
not
warrant
the
attribution
to
him
of
the
vast
projects
which
some
modern
writers
credit
him
with
he
naturally
sought
to
strengthen
himself
on
the
throne
which
by
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
he
had
ascended
and
whatever
he
did
tended
solely
to
this
end
the
name
and
the
character
that
he
had
assumed
secured
him
the
respect
and
fidelity
of
the
iranians
was
not
one
either
among
the
medes
or
the
persians
nor
among
the
members
of
the
achæmenian
race
who
dreamed
of
disputing
his
in
the
early
days
of
his
reign
the
important
thing
in
his
eyes
was
therefore
to
maintain
among
his
subjects
as
long
as
possible
the
error
as
to
his
identity
he
put
to
death
all
whether
small
or
great
who
had
been
in
any
way
implicated
in
the
affairs
of
the
real
smerdis
or
whom
he
suspected
of
any
knowledge
of
the
murder
he
withdrew
from
public
life
as
far
as
practicable
and
rarely
allowed
himself
to
be
seen
having
inherited
the
harem
of
his
predecessors
together
with
their
crown
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
condemn
his
wives
to
a
complete
seclusion
he
did
not
venture
to
hope
nor
did
those
in
his
confidence
that
the
truth
would
not
one
day
be
known
but
he
hoped
to
gain
without
loss
of
time
sufficient
popularity
to
prevent
the
revelation
of
the
imposture
from
damaging
his
prospects
the
seven
great
houses
which
he
had
dispossessed
would
in
such
a
case
refuse
to
rally
round
him
and
it
was
doubtless
to
lessen
their
prestige
that
he
extinguished
their
pyres
but
the
people
did
not
trouble
themselves
as
to
the
origin
of
their
sovereign
if
he
showed
them
his
favour
and
took
proper
precautions
to
secure
their
good
will
he
therefore
exempted
the
provinces
from
taxes
and
military
service
for
a
period
of
three
years
he
had
not
time
to
pursue
this
policy
and
if
we
may
believe
tradition
the
very
precautions
which
he
took
to
conceal
his
identity
became
the
cause
of
his
misfortunes
in
the
royal
harem
there
were
together
with
the
daughters
of
cyrus
relatives
of
all
the
persian
nobility
and
the
order
issued
to
stop
all
their
communications
with
the
outer
world
had
excited
suspicion
the
avowals
which
had
escaped
cambyses
before
the
catastrophe
were
now
called
to
mind
and
it
was
not
long
before
those
in
high
places
became
convinced
that
they
had
been
the
dupes
of
an
audacious
imposture
a
conspiracy
broke
out
under
the
leadership
of
the
chiefs
of
the
seven
clans
among
whom
was
numbered
darius
the
son
of
hystaspes
who
was
connected
according
to
a
genealogy
more
or
less
authentic
with
the
family
of
the
achæmenides
the
conspirators
surprised
gaumâta
in
his
palace
of
sikayauvatish
which
was
situated
in
the
district
of
nisaya
not
far
from
ecbatana
and
assassinated
him
on
the
of
bâgayâdîsh
the
passage
in
the
behistun
inscription
in
which
darius
sets
forth
his
own
genealogy
has
received
various
interpretations
that
of
oppert
seems
still
the
most
probable
that
the
text
indicates
two
parallel
branches
of
achæmenides
which
nourished
side
by
side
until
cambyses
died
and
darius
ascended
the
throne
such
a
genealogy
however
appears
to
be
fictitious
invented
solely
for
the
purpose
of
connecting
darius
with
the
ancient
royal
line
with
which
in
reality
he
could
claim
no
kinship
or
only
a
very
distant
connection

by

the
exact
particulars
of
this
scene
were
never
known
but
popular
imagination
soon
supplied
the
defect
furnishing
a
full
and
complete
account
of
all
that
took
place
in
the
first
place
phædimê
daughter
of
otanes
one
of
the
seven
furnished
an
authentic
proof
of
the
fraud
which
had
been
perpetrated
her
father
had
opportunely
recalled
the
marvellous
resemblance
between
smerdis
and
the
magian
and
remembered
at
the
same
time
that
the
latter
had
been
deprived
of
his
ears
in
punishment
for
some
misdeed
he
therefore
sent
certain
instructions
to
phffidimê
who
when
she
made
the
discovery
at
the
peril
of
her
life
that
her
husband
had
no
ears
communicated
the
information
to
the
disaffected
nobles
the
conspirators
thereupon
resolved
to
act
without
delay
but
when
they
arrived
at
the
palace
they
were
greeted
with
an
extraordinary
piece
of
intelligence
the
magi
disquieted
by
some
vague
rumours
which
were
being
circulated
against
them
had
besought
prexaspes
to
proclaim
to
the
people
that
the
reigning
monarch
was
indeed
smerdis
himself
but
prexaspes
instead
of
making
the
desired
declaration
informed
the
multitude
that
the
son
of
cyrus
was
indeed
dead
for
he
himself
had
murdered
him
at
the
bidding
of
cambyses
and
having
made
this
confession
he
put
himself
to
death
in
order
to
escape
the
vengeance
of
the
magi
this
act
of
prexaspes
was
an
additional
inducement
to
the
conspirators
to
execute
their
purpose
the
guard
stationed
at
the
gates
of
the
palace
dared
not
refuse
admission
to
so
noble
a
company
and
when
the
was
reached
and
the
eunuchs
forbade
further
advance
the
seven
boldly
drew
their
swords
and
forced
their
way
to
the
apartment
occupied
by
the
two
magi
the
usurpers
defended
themselves
with
bravery
but
succumbed
at
length
to
the
superior
number
of
their
opponents
after
having
wounded
two
of
the
conspirators
gobryas
pinioned
gaumâta
with
his
arms
and
in
such
a
way
that
darius
hesitated
to
make
the
fatal
thrust
for
fear
of
wounding
his
comrade
but
the
latter
bade
him
strike
at
all
hazards
and
by
good
fortune
the
sword
did
not
even
graze
him
the
crime
accomplished
the
seven
conspirators
agreed
to
choose
as
king
that
member
of
their
company
whose
horse
should
first
neigh
after
sunrise
a
stratagem
of
his
groom
caused
the
election
to
fall
on
darius
as
soon
as
he
was
duly
enthroned
he
instituted
a
festival
called
the
or
of
the
magi
in
commemoration
of
the
murder
which
had
given
him
the
crown
his
first
care
was
to
recompense
the
nobles
to
whom
he
owed
his
position
by
restoring
to
them
the
privileges
of
which
they
had
been
deprived
by
the
namely
the
right
of
free
access
to
the
king
as
well
as
the
right
of
each
individual
to
a
funeral
pyre
but
the
usurper
had
won
the
affection
of
the
people
and
even
the
inhabitants
of
those
countries
which
had
been
longest
subject
to
the
persian
sway
did
not
receive
the
new
sovereign
favourably
darius
found
himself
therefore
under
the
necessity
of
conquering
his
dominions
one
after
the
other
the
history
of
the
early
part
of
the
reign
of
darius
is
recorded
in
the
great
inscription
which
the
king
caused
to
be
cut
in
three
languages
on
the
rocks
of
behistun
the
order
of
the
events
recorded
in
it
is
not
always
easy
to
determine
i
have
finally
adopted
with
some
modifications
the
arrangement
of
marquart
which
seems
to
me
to
give
the
clearest
of
these
confused
wars
the
persian
empire
like
those
of
the
chaldæans
and
medes
had
consisted
hitherto
of
nothing
but
a
fortuitous
collection
of
provinces
under
military
rule
of
vassal
kingdoms
and
of
cities
and
tribes
there
was
no
fixed
division
of
authority
and
no
regular
system
of
government
for
the
outlying
provinces
the
governors
assigned
by
cyrus
and
cambyses
to
rule
the
various
provinces
acquired
by
conquest
were
actual
viceroys
possessing
full
control
of
an
army
and
in
some
cases
of
a
fleet
as
well
having
at
their
disposal
considerable
revenues
both
in
money
and
in
kind
and
habituated
owing
to
their
distance
from
the
capital
to
settle
pressing
questions
on
their
own
responsibility
subject
only
to
the
necessity
of
making
a
report
to
the
sovereign
when
the
affair
was
concluded
or
when
the
local
resources
were
insufficient
to
bring
it
to
a
successful
issue
for
such
free
administrators
the
temptation
must
have
been
irresistible
to
break
the
last
slender
ties
which
bound
them
to
the
empire
and
to
set
themselves
up
as
independent
monarchs
the
two
successive
revolutions
which
had
taken
place
in
less
than
a
year
convinced
such
governors
and
the
nations
over
which
they
bore
rule
that
the
stately
edifice
erected
by
cyrus
and
cambyses
was
crumbling
to
pieces
and
that
the
moment
was
propitious
for
each
of
them
to
carve
out
of
its
ruins
a
kingdom
for
himself

news
of
the
murder
rapidly
propagated
sowed
the
seeds
of
revolt
in
its
course
in
susiana
at
babylon
in
media
in
parthia
in
margiana
among
the
sattagydes
in
asia
minor
and
even
in
egypt
which
showed
itself
in
some
places
in
an
open
and
undisguised
form
while
in
others
it
was
contemptuously
veiled
under
the
appearance
of
neutrality
or
the
pretence
of
waiting
to
see
the
issue
of
events
in
the
it
is
stated
that
insurrections
broke
out
in
all
these
countries
while
darius
was
at
babylon
that
is
to
say
while
he
was
occupied
in
besieging
that
city
as
is
evident
from
the
order
of
the
events
narrated
the
first
to
break
out
into
open
rebellion
were
the
neighbouring
countries
of
elam
and
chaldæa
the
death
of
smerdis
took
place
towards
the
end
of
september
and
a
fortnight
later
saw
two
rebel
chiefs
enthroned
a
certain
athrîna
at
susa
and
a
at
babylon
athrîna
the
son
of
umbadaranma
was
a
scion
of
the
dynasty
dispossessed
by
the
successors
of
sargon
in
the
preceding
century
but
nevertheless
he
met
with
but
lukewarm
assistance
from
his
own
countrymen
he
was
taken
prisoner
before
a
month
had
passed
and
sent
to
darius
who
slew
him
with
his
own
hand
the
latest
known
document
of
the
is
dated
the
of
tisri
at
babylon
and
the
first
of
nebuchadrezzar
iii
are
dated
the
and
of
the
same
month
the
revolt
of
babylon
then
must
be
placed
between
the
and
of
tisri
that
is
either
at
the
end
of
september
or
the
beginning
of
october
the
revolt
can
not
have
lasted
much
more
than
six
weeks
for
on
the
of
athriyâdiya
following
that
is
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
december
darius
had
already
joined
issue
with
the
babylonians
on
the
banks
of
the
tigris
babylon
was
not
so
easily
mastered
her
chosen
sovereign
claimed
to
be
the
son
of
nabonidus
and
had
on
ascending
the
throne
assumed
the
illustrious
name
of
nebuchadrezzar
he
was
not
supported
moreover
by
only
a
few
busybodies
but
carried
the
whole
population
with
him
the
babylonians
who
had
at
first
welcomed
cyrus
so
warmly
and
had
fondly
imagined
that
they
had
made
him
one
of
themselves
as
they
had
made
so
many
of
their
conquerors
for
centuries
past
soon
realised
their
mistake
the
differences
of
language
manners
spirit
and
religion
between
themselves
and
the
persians
were
too
fundamental
to
allow
of
the
naturalisation
of
the
new
sovereign
and
of
the
acceptance
by
the
achæmenides
of
that
fiction
of
a
double
personality
to
which
shalmaneser
and
even
had
submitted
popular
fancy
grew
weary
of
cyrus
as
it
had
already
grown
weary
in
turn
of
all
the
foreigners
it
had
at
first
acclaimed
whether
elamite
kaldâ
or
assyrian
and
by
a
national
reaction
the
son
of
nabonidus
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
a
devotion
proportionately
as
great
as
the
hatred
which
had
been
felt
twenty
years
before
for
his
pretended
sire
the
situation
might
become
serious
if
he
were
given
time
to
consolidate
his
power
for
the
loyalty
of
the
ancient
provinces
of
the
chaldæan
empire
was
wavering
and
there
was
no
security
that
they
would
not
feel
inclined
to
follow
the
example
of
the
capital
as
soon
as
they
should
receive
news
of
the
sedition
darius
therefore
led
the
bulk
of
his
forces
to
babylon
without
a
more
delay
than
was
absolutely
necessary
and
the
event
proved
that
he
had
good
reason
for
such
haste
nebuchadrezzar
iii
had
taken
advantage
of
the
few
weeks
which
had
elapsed
since
his
accession
to
garrison
the
same
positions
on
the
right
bank
of
the
tigris
as
nabonidus
had
endeavoured
to
defend
against
cyrus
at
the
northern
end
of
the
fortifications
erected
by
his
ancestor
a
flotilla
patrolled
the
river
and
his
lines
presented
so
formidable
a
front
that
darius
could
not
venture
on
a
direct
attack
he
arranged
his
troops
in
two
divisions
which
he
mounted
partly
on
horses
partly
on
camels
and
eluding
the
vigilance
of
his
adversary
by
attacking
him
simultaneously
on
many
sides
succeeded
in
gaining
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
the
chaldæans
striving
in
vain
to
drive
him
back
into
the
stream
were
at
length
defeated
on
the
of
athriyâdiya
and
they
retired
in
good
order
on
babylon
six
days
later
on
the
of
anâmaka
they
fought
a
second
battle
at
zazanu
on
the
bank
of
the
euphrates
and
were
again
totally
defeated
nebuchadrezzar
escaped
with
a
handful
of
cavalry
and
hastened
to
shut
himself
up
in
his
city
darius
soon
followed
him
but
if
he
cherished
a
hope
that
the
babylonians
would
open
their
gates
to
him
without
further
resistance
as
they
had
done
to
cyrus
he
met
with
a
disappointment
for
he
was
compelled
to
commence
a
regular
siege
and
suspend
all
other
operations
and
that
too
at
a
moment
when
the
provinces
were
breaking
out
into
open
insurrection
on
every
hand
the
account
given
by
darius
seems
to
imply
that
no
interval
of
time
elapsed
between
the
second
defeat
of
nebuchadrezzar
iii
and
the
taking
of
babylon
so
that
several
modern
historians
have
rejected
the
idea
of
an
obstinate
resistance
herodotus
however
speaks
of
the
long
siege
the
city
sustained
and
the
discovery
of
tablets
dated
in
the
first
and
even
the
second
year
of
nebuchadrezzar
iii
shows
that
the
siege
was
prolonged
into
the
second
year
of
this
usurper
at
least
until
the
month
of
nisân
april
no
evidence
can
be
drawn
from
the
tablets
dated
in
the
reign
of
darius
for
the
oldest
yet
discovered
which
is
dated
in
the
month
sebat
in
the
year
of
his
accession
and
consequently
prior
to
the
second
year
of
nebuchadrezzar
comes
from
on
the
other
hand
the
statement
that
all
the
revolts
broke
out
while
darius
was
does
not
allow
of
the
supposition
that
all
the
events
recorded
before
his
departure
for
media
could
have
been
compressed
into
the
space
of
three
or
four
months
it
seems
therefore
more
probable
that
the
siege
lasted
till
as
it
can
well
have
done
if
credit
be
given
to
the
mention
of
months
at
by
herodotus
perhaps
the
siege
was
brought
to
an
end
in
the
may
of
that
year
as
calculated
by
marquart
illustration
darius
piercing
a
rebel
with
his
lance
before
a
group
of
four
prisoners
drawn
by
from
the
impression
of
an
intaglio
at
petersburg
the
attempt
of
the
persian
adventurer
martîya
to
stir
up
the
susians
to
revolt
in
his
rear
failed
thanks
to
the
favourable
disposition
of
the
natives
who
refused
to
recognise
in
him
ummanîsh
the
heir
of
their
national
princes
media
however
yielded
unfortunately
to
the
solicitations
of
a
certain
fravartîsh
who
had
assumed
the
personality
of
khshatrita
of
the
race
of
cyaxares
and
its
revolt
marked
almost
the
beginning
of
a
total
of
the
empire
the
memory
of
astyages
and
cyaxares
had
not
yet
faded
so
completely
as
to
cause
the
median
nobles
to
relinquish
the
hope
of
reasserting
the
supremacy
of
media
the
opportunity
for
accomplishing
this
aim
now
seemed
all
the
more
favourable
from
the
fact
that
darius
had
been
obliged
to
leave
this
province
almost
immediately
after
the
assassination
of
the
usurper
and
to
take
from
it
all
the
troops
that
he
could
muster
for
the
siege
of
babylon
several
of
the
nomadic
tribes
still
remained
faithful
to
him
but
all
the
settled
inhabitants
of
media
ranged
themselves
under
the
banner
of
the
pretender
and
the
spirit
of
insurrection
spread
thereupon
into
armenia
and
assyria
for
one
moment
there
was
a
fear
lest
it
should
extend
to
asia
minor
also
where
orcetes
accustomed
in
the
absence
of
cambyses
to
act
as
an
autonomous
sovereign
displayed
little
zeal
in
accommodating
himself
to
the
new
order
of
things
there
was
so
much
uncertainty
as
to
the
leanings
of
the
persian
guard
of
orcetes
that
darius
did
not
venture
to
degrade
the
satrap
officially
but
despatched
bagseus
to
sardes
with
precise
instructions
which
enabled
him
to
accomplish
his
mission
by
degrees
so
as
not
to
risk
a
lydian
revolt
his
first
act
was
to
show
the
guard
a
rescript
by
which
they
were
relieved
from
attendance
on
orcetes
and
they
immediately
laid
down
their
emboldened
by
their
ready
obedience
bagseus
presented
to
the
secretary
a
second
letter
which
contained
his
instructions
great
king
commands
those
persians
who
are
in
sardes
to
kill
it
is
recorded
drew
their
swords
and
slew
the
context
of
herodotus
indicates
that
the
events
narrated
took
place
shortly
after
the
accession
of
darius
further
on
herodotus
mentions
as
contemporaneous
with
the
siege
of
babylon
events
which
took
place
after
the
death
of
orcetes
it
is
probable
therefore
that
the
scene
described
by
herodotus
occurred
in
at
the
latest
a
revolt
in
asia
minor
was
thus
averted
at
a
time
when
civil
war
continued
to
rage
in
the
centre
of
iran
the
situation
however
continued
critical
darius
could
not
think
of
abandoning
the
siege
of
babylon
and
of
thus
both
losing
the
fruits
of
his
victories
and
seeing
nebuchadrezzar
reappear
in
assyria
or
susiana
on
the
other
hand
his
army
was
a
small
one
and
he
would
incur
great
risks
in
detaching
any
of
his
military
chiefs
for
a
campaign
against
the
mede
with
an
insufficient
force
he
decided
however
to
adopt
the
latter
course
and
while
he
himself
presided
over
the
blockade
he
simultaneously
despatched
two
columns
one
to
media
under
the
command
of
the
persian
vidarna
one
of
the
seven
the
other
to
armenia
under
the
armenian
dâdarshîsh
vidarna
encountered
khshatrita
near
marush
in
the
mountainous
region
of
the
old
namri
on
the
of
anâmaka
and
gave
him
battle
but
though
he
claimed
the
victory
the
result
was
so
indecisive
that
he
halted
in
kambadênê
at
the
entrance
to
the
gorges
of
the
zagros
mountains
and
was
there
obliged
to
await
reinforcements
before
advancing
further
dâdarshîsh
on
his
side
gained
three
victories
over
the
armenians
one
near
zuzza
on
the
of
thuravâhara
another
at
tigra
ten
days
later
and
the
third
on
the
of
thâigarshîsh
at
a
place
not
far
from
uhyâma
but
he
also
was
compelled
to
suspend
operations
and
remain
inactive
pending
the
arrival
of
fresh
troops
half
the
year
was
spent
in
inaction
on
either
side
for
the
rebels
had
not
suffered
less
than
their
opponents
and
while
endeavouring
to
reorganise
their
forces
they
opened
negotiations
with
the
provinces
of
the
with
the
view
of
prevailing
on
them
to
join
their
cause
darius
still
detained
before
babylon
was
unable
to
recommence
hostilities
until
the
end
of
he
sent
vaumisa
to
replace
dâdarshîsh
as
the
head
of
the
army
in
armenia
and
the
new
general
distinguished
himself
at
the
outset
by
winning
a
decisive
victory
on
the
of
anâmaka
near
izitush
in
assyria
but
the
effect
which
he
hoped
to
secure
from
this
success
was
neutralised
almost
immediately
by
grievous
defections
sagartia
in
the
first
place
rose
in
rebellion
at
the
call
of
a
pretended
descendant
of
oyaxares
named
chitrantakhma
hyrcania
the
province
governed
by
hystaspes
the
father
of
darius
followed
suit
and
took
up
the
cause
of
khshatrita
and
soon
after
margiana
broke
out
into
revolt
at
the
instigation
of
a
certain
frâda
even
persia
itself
deserted
darius
and
chose
another
king
instead
of
a
sovereign
whom
no
one
seemed
willing
to
acknowledge
many
of
the
mountain
tribes
could
not
yet
resign
themselves
to
the
belief
that
the
male
line
of
cyrus
had
become
extinct
with
the
death
of
cambyses
the
usurpation
of
gaumâta
and
the
accession
of
darius
had
not
quenched
their
faith
in
the
existence
of
smerdis
if
the
magian
were
an
impostor
it
did
not
necessarily
follow
that
smerdis
had
been
assassinated
and
when
a
certain
vahyazdâta
rose
up
in
the
town
of
târavâ
in
the
district
of
yautiyâ
and
announced
himself
as
the
younger
son
of
cyrus
they
received
him
with
enthusiastic
acclamations
a
preliminary
success
gained
by
hystaspes
at
vispauzatîsh
in
parthia
on
the
of
viyakhna
prevented
the
guerilla
bands
of
hyrcania
from
joining
forces
with
the
medes
and
some
days
later
the
fall
of
babylon
at
length
set
darius
free
to
utilise
his
resources
to
the
utmost
the
long
resistance
of
nebuchadrezzar
furnished
a
fruitful
theme
for
legend
a
fanciful
story
was
soon
substituted
for
the
true
account
of
the
memorable
siege
he
had
sustained
half
a
century
later
when
his
very
name
was
forgotten
the
heroism
of
his
people
continued
to
be
extolled
beyond
measure
when
darius
arrived
before
the
ramparts
he
found
the
country
a
desert
the
banks
of
the
canals
cut
through
and
the
gardens
and
destroyed
the
crops
had
been
gathered
and
the
herds
driven
within
the
walls
of
the
city
while
the
garrison
had
reduced
by
a
massacre
the
number
of
the
women
having
all
been
strangled
with
the
exception
of
those
who
were
needed
to
bake
the
bread
at
the
end
of
twenty
months
the
siege
seemed
no
nearer
to
its
close
than
at
the
outset
and
the
besiegers
were
on
the
point
of
losing
heart
when
at
length
zopyrus
one
of
the
seven
sacrificed
himself
for
the
success
of
the
blockading
army
slitting
his
nose
and
ears
and
lacerating
his
back
with
the
lash
of
a
whip
he
made
his
way
into
the
city
as
a
deserter
and
persuaded
the
garrison
to
assign
him
a
post
of
danger
under
pretence
of
avenging
the
he
had
received
from
his
former
master
he
directed
some
successful
sallies
on
points
previously
agreed
upon
and
having
thus
lulled
to
rest
any
remaining
feelings
of
distrust
on
the
part
of
the
garrison
he
treacherously
opened
to
the
persians
the
two
gates
of
which
he
was
in
charge
three
thousand
babylonians
were
impaled
the
walls
were
razed
to
the
ground
and
the
survivors
of
the
struggle
were
exiled
and
replaced
by
strange
colonists
the
only
authentic
fact
about
this
story
is
the
length
of
the
siege
nebuchadrezzar
was
put
to
death
and
darius
at
length
free
to
act
hastened
to
despatch
one
of
his
lieutenants
the
persian
artavardiya
against
vahyazdâta
while
he
himself
marched
upon
the
medes
with
the
main
body
of
the
royal
army

the
siege
of
babylon
forty
years
later
under
xerxes
according
to
him
it
was
megabysus
son
of
zopyrus
who
betrayed
the
city
polysenus
asserts
that
the
stratagem
of
zopyrus
was
adopted
in
imitation
of
a
sakian
who
dwelt
beyond
the
oxus
latin
writers
transferred
the
story
to
italy
and
localised
it
at
gabii
but
the
roman
hero
sextus
tarquinius
did
not
carry
his
devotion
to
the
point
of
mutilating
himself
i
sent
the
army
of
the
persians

hitherto
been
confronted
by
the
local
militia
brave
but
inexperienced
troops
with
whom
they
had
been
able
to
contend
on
a
fairly
equal
footing
the
entry
into
the
field
of
the
veteran
regiments
of
cyrus
and
cambyses
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
and
promptly
brought
the
campaign
to
a
successful
issue
darius
entered
media
by
the
defiles
of
kerend
reinforced
vidarna
in
kambadçnê
and
crushed
the
enemy
near
the
town
of
kundurush
on
the
of
adukanîsh
khshatrita
fled
towards
the
north
with
some
few
horsemen
doubtless
hoping
to
reach
the
recesses
of
mount
elburz
and
to
continue
there
the
struggle
but
he
was
captured
at
bagâ
and
carried
to
ecbatana
his
horrible
punishment
was
proportionate
to
the
fear
he
had
inspired
his
nose
ears
and
tongue
were
cut
off
and
his
eyes
gouged
out
and
in
this
mutilated
condition
he
was
placed
in
chains
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
to
demonstrate
to
his
former
subjects
how
the
king
could
punish
an
impostor
when
the
people
had
laid
this
lesson
sufficiently
to
heart
khshatrita
was
impaled
many
of
his
principal
adherents
were
ranged
around
him
and
suffered
the
same
fate
while
the
rest
were
decapitated
as
an
example
babylon
and
media
being
thus
successfully
vanquished
the
possession
of
the
empire
was
assured
to
darius
whatever
might
happen
in
other
parts
of
his
territory
and
henceforth
the
process
of
repressing
disaffection
went
on
unchecked
immediately
after
the
decisive
battle
of
kundurush
vaumisa
accomplished
the
pacification
of
armenia
by
a
victory
won
near
autiyâra
and
artavardiya
defeated
vahyazdâta
for
the
first
time
at
eakhâ
in
persia
vahyazdâta
had
committed
the
mistake
of
dividing
his
forces
and
sending
a
portion
of
them
to
arachosia
vivâna
the
governor
of
this
province
twice
crushed
the
invaders
and
almost
at
the
same
time
the
persian
dâdardîsh
of
bactriana
was
triumphing
over
frâda
and
winning
margiana
back
to
allegiance
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
decisive
issue
of
the
struggle
might
be
prolonged
for
months
since
it
was
announced
that
the
appearance
of
a
new
on
the
scene
had
been
followed
by
the
advent
of
a
second
in
chaldæa
darius
left
only
a
weak
garrison
at
babylon
when
he
started
to
attack
khshatrita
a
certain
arakha
an
armenian
by
birth
presenting
himself
to
the
babylonian
people
as
the
son
of
nabonidus
caused
himself
to
be
proclaimed
king
in
december
but
the
city
was
still
suffering
so
severely
from
the
miseries
of
the
long
siege
that
it
was
easy
for
the
mede
vindafrâ
to
reduce
it
promptly
to
submission
after
a
month
or
six
weeks
of
this
was
the
last
attempt
at
revolt
expiated
his
crimes
by
being
impaled
and
hystaspes
routed
the
hyrcanian
battalions
at
patigrabana
in
parthia
artavardiya
having
defeated
vahyazdâta
near
mount
paraga
on
the
of
garmapada
besieged
him
in
his
fortress
of
uvâdeshaya
and
was
not
long
in
effecting
his
capture
the
civil
war
came
thus
to
an
end
it
had
been
severe
but
it
had
brought
into
such
prominence
the
qualities
of
the
sovereign
that
no
one
henceforth
dared
to
dispute
his
possession
of
the
crown
a
man
of
less
energetic
character
and
calm
judgment
would
have
lost
his
head
at
the
beginning
of
the
struggle
when
almost
every
successive
week
brought
him
news
of
a
fresh
rebellion
in
susiana
babylon
media
armenia
assyria
margiana
hyrcania
and
even
persia
itself
not
to
speak
of
the
intrigues
in
asia
minor
and
egypt
he
would
have
scattered
his
forces
to
meet
the
dangers
on
all
sides
at
once
and
would
assuredly
have
either
succumbed
in
the
struggle
or
succeeded
only
by
chance
after
his
fate
had
trembled
in
the
balance
for
years
darius
however
from
the
very
beginning
knew
how
to
single
out
the
important
points
upon
which
to
deal
such
vigorous
blows
as
would
ensure
him
the
victory
with
the
least
possible
delay
he
saw
that
babylon
with
its
numerous
population
its
immense
wealth
and
prestige
and
its
memory
of
recent
supremacy
was
the
real
danger
to
his
empire
and
he
never
relaxed
his
hold
on
it
until
it
was
subdued
leaving
his
generals
to
deal
with
the
other
nations
the
medes
included
and
satisfied
if
each
of
them
could
but
hold
his
adversary
in
check
without
gaining
any
decided
advantage
over
him
the
event
justified
his
decision
when
once
babylon
had
fallen
the
remaining
rebels
were
no
longer
a
source
of
fear
to
defeat
khshatrita
was
the
work
of
a
few
weeks
only
and
the
submission
of
the
other
provinces
followed
as
a
natural
consequence
on
the
ruin
of
media
mention
of
some
new
wars
is
made
towards
the
end
of
the
inscription
but
the
text
here
is
so
mutilated
that
the
sense
can
no
longer
be
easily
determined
illustration
rebels
brought
to
darius
by
this
is
the
scene
depicted
on
the
rock
of

after
consummating
his

darius
caused
an

in

of

to
be
carved
on
the
rocks
in
the
pass
of
bagistana

of

however
come
to
a
close
with
the
punishment
of
vahyazdâta
for
though
no
tribe
or
chieftain
remained
now
in
open
revolt
many
of
those
who
had
taken
no
active
share
in
the
rebellion
had
by
their
conduct
during
the
crisis
laid
themselves
open
to
grave
suspicions
and
it
seemed
but
prudent
to
place
them
under
strict
surveillance
or
to
remove
them
from
office
altogether
orotes
had
been
summarily
despatched
and
his
execution
did
not
disturb
the
peace
of
asia
minor
but
aryandes
to
whose
rule
cambyses
had
entrusted
the
valley
of
the
nile
displayed
no
less
marked
symptoms
of
disaffection
and
deserved
the
same
fate
though
he
had
not
ventured
to
usurp
openly
the
title
of
king
he
had
arrogated
to
himself
all
the
functions
and
rights
of
royalty
and
had
manifested
as
great
an
independence
in
his
government
as
if
he
had
been
an
actual
pharaoh
the
inhabitants
of
gyrene
did
not
approve
of
the
eagerness
displayed
by
their
tyrant
arkesilas
iii
to
place
himself
under
the
persian
yoke
after
first
expelling
and
then
recalling
him
they
drove
him
away
a
second
time
and
at
length
murdered
him
at
barca
whither
he
had
fled
for
refuge
pheretimô
came
to
egypt
to
seek
the
help
of
aryandes
just
as
laarchos
had
formerly
implored
the
assistance
of
amasis
and
represented
to
him
that
her
son
had
fallen
a
victim
to
his
devotion
to
his
suzerain
it
was
a
good
opportunity
to
put
to
ransom
one
of
the
wealthiest
countries
of
africa
so
the
governor
sent
to
the
cyrenaica
all
the
men
and
vessels
at
his
disposal
barca
was
the
only
city
to
offer
any
resistance
and
the
persian
troops
were
detained
for
nine
months
motionless
before
its
walls
and
the
city
then
only
succumbed
through
treachery
some
detachments
forced
their
way
as
far
as
the
distant
town
of
euesperides
and
it
is
possible
that
aryandes
dreamt
for
a
moment
of
realising
the
designs
which
cambyses
had
formed
against
carthage
insufficiency
of
supplies
stayed
the
advance
of
his
generals
but
the
riches
of
their
ally
cyrene
offered
them
a
strong
temptation
and
they
were
deliberating
how
they
might
make
this
wealth
their
own
before
returning
to
memphis
and
were
perhaps
on
the
point
of
risking
the
attempt
when
they
received
orders
to
withdraw
the
march
across
the
desert
proved
almost
fatal
to
them
the
libyans
of
marmarica
attracted
by
the
spoils
with
which
the
persian
troops
were
laden
harassed
them
incessantly
and
inflicted
on
them
serious
losses
they
succeeded
however
in
arriving
safely
with
their
prisoners
among
whom
were
the
survivors
of
the
inhabitants
of
barca
at
this
time
the
tide
of
fortune
was
setting
strongly
in
favour
of
darius
aryandes
anxious
to
propitiate
that
monarch
despatched
these
wretched
captives
to
persia
as
a
trophy
of
his
success
and
darius
sent
them
into
bactriana
where
they
founded
a
new
barca
this
is
the
town
which
later
on
under
the
lagidæ
received
the
name
of
berenice
and
which
is
now
called
benghazi
it
is
doubtless
to
these
acts
of
personal
authority
on
the
part
of
aryandes
that
darius
alludes
in
the
behistun
inscription
when
he
says
i
was
before
babylon
the
following
provinces
revolted
against
me
persia
and
susiana
the
medes
and
assyria
and
the
egyptians
but
this
tardy
homage
availed
him
nothing
darius
himself
visited
egypt
and
disembarrassed
himself
of
troublesome
subject
by
his
summary
execution
inflicted
some
said
because
he
had
issued
coins
of
a
superior
fineness
to
those
of
the
royal
mint
while
according
to
others
it
was
because
he
had
plundered
egypt
and
so
the
egyptians
as
to
incite
them
to
rebellion
it
is
not
certain
that
aryandes
did
actually
strike
any
coinage
in
his
own
name
and
perhaps
herodotus
has
only
repeated
a
popular
story
current
in
egypt
in
his
days
if
this
money
actually
existed
its
coinage
was
but
a
pretext
employed
by
darius
the
true
motive
of
the
condemnation
of
aryandes
was
certainly
an
armed
revolt
or
a
serious
presumption
of
revolutionary
intentions
after
the
suppression
of
this
rival
darius
set
himself
to
win
the
affection
of
his
egyptian
province
or
at
least
to
render
its
servitude
bearable
with
a
country
so
devout
and
so
impressed
with
its
own
superiority
over
all
other
nations
the
best
means
of
accomplishing
his
object
was
to
show
profound
respect
for
its
national
gods
and
its
past
glory
darius
therefore
proceeded
to
shower
favours
on
the
priests
who
had
been
subject
to
persecution
ever
since
the
disastrous
campaign
in
ethiopia
cambyses
had
sent
into
exile
in
elam
the
chief
priest
of
sais
that
who
had
initiated
him
into
the
sacred
rites
darius
gave
permission
to
this
important
personage
to
return
to
his
native
land
and
commissioned
him
to
repair
the
damage
inflicted
by
the
madness
of
the
son
of
cyrus
uzaharrîsnîti
escorted
back
with
honour
to
his
native
city
there
the
colleges
of
sacred
scribes
and
restored
to
the
temple
of
nît
the
lands
and
revenues
which
had
been
confiscated
greek
tradition
soon
improved
upon
the
national
account
of
this
episode
and
asserted
that
darius
took
an
interest
in
the
mysteries
of
egyptian
theology
and
studied
the
sacred
books
and
that
on
his
arrival
at
memphis
in
immediately
after
the
death
of
an
apis
he
took
part
publicly
in
the
general
mourning
and
promised
a
reward
of
a
hundred
talents
of
gold
to
whosoever
should
discover
the
successor
of
the
bull
according
to
a
popular
story
still
current
when
herodotus
travelled
in
egypt
the
king
visited
the
temple
of
pthah
before
leaving
memphis
and
ordered
his
statue
to
be
erected
there
beside
that
of
sesostris
the
priests
refused
to
obey
this
command
for
said
they
has
not
equalled
the
deeds
of
sesostris
he
has
not
conquered
the
scythians
whom
sesostris
darius
replied
that
hoped
to
accomplish
as
much
as
sesostris
had
done
if
he
lived
as
long
as
sesostris
and
so
conciliated
the
patriotic
pride
of
the
priests
the
egyptians
grateful
for
his
moderation
numbered
him
among
the
legislators
whose
memory
they
revered
by
the
side
of
menés
asykhis
bocchoris
and
sabaco
the
whole
empire
was
now
obedient
to
the
will
of
one
man
but
the
ordeal
from
which
it
had
recently
escaped
showed
how
loosely
the
elements
of
it
were
bound
together
and
with
what
facility
they
could
be
disintegrated
the
system
of
government
in
force
hitherto
was
that
introduced
into
assyria
by
which
had
proved
so
eminently
successful
in
the
time
of
sargon
and
his
descendants
babylon
and
ecbatana
had
inherited
it
from
nineveh
and
persepolis
had
in
turn
adopted
it
from
ecbatana
and
babylon
it
had
always
been
open
to
objections
of
which
by
no
means
the
least
was
the
great
amount
of
power
and
independence
accorded
by
it
to
the
provincial
governors
but
this
inconvenience
had
been
little
felt
when
the
empire
was
of
moderate
dimensions
and
when
no
province
permanently
annexed
to
the
empire
lay
at
any
very
great
distance
from
the
capital
for
the
time
being
but
this
was
no
longer
the
case
now
that
persian
rule
extended
over
nearly
the
whole
of
asia
from
the
indus
to
the
thracian
bosphorus
and
over
a
portion
of
africa
also
it
must
have
seemed
far
from
prudent
to
set
governors
invested
with
almost
regal
powers
over
countries
so
distant
that
a
decree
despatched
from
the
palace
might
take
several
weeks
to
reach
its
destination
the
heterogeneity
of
the
elements
in
each
province
was
a
guarantee
of
peace
in
the
eyes
of
the
sovereign
and
darius
carefully
abstained
from
any
attempt
at
unification
not
only
did
he
allow
vassal
republics
and
tributary
kingdoms
and
nations
to
subsist
side
by
side
but
he
took
care
that
each
should
preserve
its
own
local
dynasty
language
writing
customs
religion
and
peculiar
legislation
besides
the
right
to
coin
money
stamped
with
the
name
of
its
chief
or
its
civic
symbol
the
greek
cities
of
the
coast
maintained
their
own
peculiar
constitutions
which
they
had
enjoyed
under
the
mernmadas
darius
merely
required
that
the
chief
authority
among
them
should
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
aristocratic
party
or
in
those
of
an
elective
or
hereditary
tyrant
whose
personal
interest
secured
his
fidelity
the
carians
lycians
pamphylians
and
continued
under
the
rule
of
their
native
princes
subject
only
to
the
usual
obligations
of
the
taxation
and
military
service
as
in
past
days
the
majority
of
the
barbarous
tribes
which
inhabited
the
taurus
and
the
mountainous
regions
in
the
centre
of
asia
minor
were
even
exempted
from
all
definite
taxes
and
were
merely
required
to
respect
the
couriers
caravans
and
armies
which
passed
through
their
territory
herodotus
cites
among
the
commanders
of
the
persian
fleet
three
carian
dynasts
histiseus
pigres
and
damasithymus
besides
the
famous
artemisia
of
halicarnassus
in
herodotus
where
a
dynast
named
kyberniskos
son
of
sika
is
mentioned
among
the
commanders
of
the
fleet
the
received
text
of
herodotus
needs
correction
and
we
should
read
kybernis
son
of
kossika
some
of
whose
coins
are
still
in
existence
the
cilician
contingent
in
the
fleet
of

at

was
commanded
by

and

had

a

governed
by
a
pharaoh
who
though
a
foreigner
was
yet
reputed
to
be
of
the
solar
race
the
land
continued
to
be
divided
unequally
into
diverse
principalities

still
preserving
its
character
as
a

under
the
guidance
of
the
pallacide
of

and
her
priestly
counsellors
while
the
other
districts
subsisted
under
military
chieftains
our
information
concerning
the
organisation
of
the
central
and
eastern
provinces
is
incomplete
but
it
is
certain
that
here
also
the
same
system
prevailed
in
the
years
of
peace
which
succeeded
the
troubled
opening
of
his
reign
that
is
from
to
darius
divided
the
whole
empire
into
satrapies
whose
number
varied
at
different
periods
of
his
reign
from
twenty
to
and
even
three
kings
viz
the
kings
of
sidon
tyre
and
arvad
bore
commands
in
the
phoenician
fleet
of
xerxes
herodotus
states
that
this
dividing
of
the
empire
into
provinces
took
place
immediately
after
the
accession
of
darius
and
this
mistake
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
he
ignores
almost
entirely
the
civil
wars
which
filled
the
earliest
years
of
the
reign
his
enumeration
of
twenty
satrapies
comprises
india
and
omits
thrace
which
enables
us
to
refer
the
drawing
up
of
his
list
to
a
period
before
the
scythian
campaign
viz
before
herodotus
very
probably
copied
it
from
the
work
of
hecatseus
of
miletus
and
consequently
it
reproduces
a
document
contemporary
with
darius
himself
the
number
twenty
is
as
has
been
remarked
that
given
by
herodotus
and
probably
by
hecatæus
of
miletus
the
great
behistun
inscription
enumerates
countries
and
the
inscription
of
gives
persia
proper
was
not
included
among
these
for
she
had
been
the
cradle
of
the
reigning
house
and
the
instrument
of
conquest
in
the
great
behistun
inscription
darius
mentions
persia
first
of
all
the
countries
in
his
possession
in
the
inscription
e
of
persepolis
he
omits
it
entirely
and
in
that
of
he
does
not
include
it
in
the
general
catalogue
the
iranian
and
the
parts
of
india
or
regions
beyond
the
oxus
which
bordered

important

khorasmia

sogdiana
gandaria
and
the
country
of
the
sakae
reaching
from
the
plains
of
tartary
almost
to
the
borders
of
china
the
country
of
the

in
the
upper
basin
of
the
elmend
arachosia
and
the
land
of
maka
on
the
shores
of
the
indian
ocean
ten
satrapies
were
reckoned
in
the
west
uvayâ
elam
in
which
lay
susa
one
of
the
favourite
residences
of
darius
babirus
babylon
and
chaldæa

the
ancient
kingdom
of
assyria
arabayâ
stretching
from
the
khabur
to
the
litany
the
jordan
and
the
orontes
egypt
the
peoples
of
the
sea
among
whom
were
reckoned
the
phoenicians
cilicians
and
cypriots
and
the
islanders
of
the
ægean
yaunâ
which
comprised
lycia
caria
and
the
greek
colonies
along
the
coast
sparda
with
phrygia
and
mysia
armenia
and
lastly
katpatuka
or
cappadocia
which
lay
on
both
sides
of
the
halys
from
the
taurus
to
the
black
sea
if
each
of
these
provinces
had
been
governed
as
formerly
by
a
single
individual
who
thus
became
king
in
all
but
name
and
descent
the
empire
would
have
run
great
risk
of
a
speedy
dissolution
darius
therefore
avoided
concentrating
the
civil
and
military
powers
in
the
same
hands
in
each
province
he
installed
three
officials
independent
of
each
other
but
each
in
direct
communication
with
himself
a
satrap
a
general
and
a
secretary
of
state
the
satraps
were
chosen
from
any
class
in
the
nation
from
among
the
poor
as
well
as
from
among
the
wealthy
from
foreigners
as
well
as
from
persians
but
the
most
important
satrapies
were
bestowed
only
on
persons
allied
by
or
marriage
with
the
achæmenids
and
by
preference
on
the
legitimate
descendants
of
the
six
noble
houses
they
were
not
appointed
for
any
prescribed
period
but
continued
in
office
during
the
pleasure
they
exercised
absolute
authority
in
all
civil
matters
and
maintained
a
court
a
palaces
and
extensive
parks
or
where
they
indulged
in
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
they
controlled
the
incidence
of
taxation
administered
justice
and
possessed
the
power
of
life
and
death
herodotus
mentions
a
satrap
chosen
from
among
the
lydians
pactyas
and
another
satrap
of
greek
extraction
xenagoras
of
halicarnassus
the
most
characteristic
instance
is
that
of
hystaspes
who
was
satrap
of
persia
under
oambyses
and
of
parthia
and
hyrcania
under
his
own
son
one
of
the
brothers
of
darius
artaphernes
was
satrap
of
sardes
and
three
of
the
sons
achemenes
ariabignes
and
masistes
were
satraps
of
egypt
ionia
and
bactriana
respectively
to
understand
how
well
established
was
the
custom
of
bestowing
satrapies
on
those
only
who
were
allied
by
marriage
to
the
royal
house
it
is
sufficient
to
recall
the
fact
that
later
on
under
xerxes
when
pausanias
king
of
sparta
had
thoughts
of
obtaining
the
position
of
satrap
in
greece
he
asked
for
the
hand
of
an
achæmenian
princess
we
know
for
example
that
orcotes
satrap
of
sardes
under
cyrus
cambyses
and
darius
had
a
of
persians
thus
artaphernes
satrap
of
sardes
had
a
cadastral
survey
made
of
the
territory
of
the
ionians
and
by
the
results
of
this
survey
he
regulated
the
imposition
of
taxes
from
that
time
up
to
the
present
day
are
exacted
according
to
his
attached
to
each
satrap
was
a
secretary
of
state
who
ostensibly
acted
as
his
chancellor
but
whose
real
function
was
to
exercise
a
secret
supervision
over
his
conduct
and
report
upon
it
to
the
imperial
ministers
the
persian
troops
native
militia
and
auxiliary
forces
quartered
in
the
province
were
placed
under
the
orders
moreover
of
a
general
who
was
usually
hostile
to
the
satrap
and
the
secretary
these
three
officials
counterbalanced
each
other
and
held
each
other
mutually
in
check
so
that
a
revolt
was
rendered
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
all
three
were
kept
in
constant
communication
with
the
court
by
relays
of
regular
couriers
who
carried
their
despatches
on
horseback
or
on
camels
from
one
end
of
asia
to
the
other
in
the
space
of
a
few
weeks
the
rôle
played
by
the
secretary
is
clearly
indicated
by
the
history
of
orotes
satrap
of
sardes
while
darius
appoints
his
brother
artaphernes
satrap
of
lydia
he
entrusts
the
command
of
the
army
and
the
fleet
to
otanes
son
of
sisamnes
similarly
several
generals
are
met
with
at
the
side
of
artaphernes
in
the
ionic
revolt
xenophon
compares
their
speed
in
travelling
to
the
flight
of
birds
a
good
example
of
the
use
of
the
camel
for
the
postal
service
is
cited
by
strabo
on
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
philotas
and
the
execution
of
parmenion
under
alexander
the
most
celebrated
of
the
was
that
which
ran
from
sardes
to
susa
through
lydia
and
phrygia
crossing
the
halys
traversing
cappadocia
and
cilicia
and
passing
through
armenia
and
across
the
euphrates
until
at
length
after
passing
through
matiênê
and
the
country
of
the
cossæans
it
reached
elam
this
main
route
was
divided
into
one
hundred
and
eleven
stages
which
were
performed
by
couriers
on
horseback
and
partly
in
in
days
other
routes
of
which
we
have
no
particular
information
led
to
egypt
media
bactria
and
india
and
by
their
means
the
imperial
officials
in
the
capital
were
kept
fully
informed
of
all
that
took
place
in
the
most
distant
parts
of
the
empire
as
an
extra
precaution
the
king
sent
out
annually
certain
officers
called
his
or
his
who
appeared
on
the
scene
when
they
were
least
expected
and
investigated
the
financial
or
political
situation
reformed
abuses
in
the
administration
and
reprimanded
or
even
suspended
the
government
officials
they
were
accompanied
by
a
body
of
troops
to
support
their
decisions
whose
presence
invested
their
counsels
with
the
strongest
sanction
an
unfavourable
report
a
slight
irregularity
a
mere
suspicion
even
was
sufficient
to
disqualify
a
satrap
sometimes
he
was
deposed
often
secretly
condemned
to
death
without
a
trial
and
the
execution
of
the
judgment
was
committed
even
to
his
own
servants
ctesias
at
the
end
of
his
work
describes
the
route
leading
from
ephesus
to
bactriana
and
india
it
is
probable
that
the
route
described
by
isidorus
of
charax
in
his
already
existed
in
the
times
of
the
achæmenids
and
was
traversed

their
postal
couriers

in

of

the
persian
proverb

has

vender
of

after
the

by

a
messenger
would
arrive
unexpectedly
and
remit
to
the
guards
an
order
charging
them
to
put
their
chief
to
death
an
order
which
was
promptly
executed
at
the
mere
sight
of
the
royal
decree
this
reform
in
the
method
of
government
was
displeasing
to
the
persian
nobles
whose
liberty
of
action
it
was
designed
to
curtail
and
they
took
their
revenge
in
sneering
at
the
obedience
they
could
not
refuse
to
render
cyrus
they
said
had
been
a
father
cambyses
a
master
but
darius
was
only
a
pedler
greedy
of
gain
the
chief
reason
for
this
division
of
the
empire
into
provinces
was
indeed
fiscal
rather
than
political
to
arrange
the
incidence
of
taxation
in
his
province
to
collect
the
revenue
in
due
time
and
forward
the
total
amount
to
the
imperial
treasury
formed
the
fundamental
duty
of
a
satrap
to
which
all
others
had
to
yield
persia
proper
was
exempt
from
the
payment
of
any
fixed
sum
its
inhabitants
being
merely
required
to
offer
presents
to
the
king
whenever
he
passed
through
their
districts
these
gifts
were
proportioned
to
the
fortunes
of
the
individual
contributors
they
might
consist
merely
of
an
ox
or
a
sheep
a
little
milk
or
cheese
some
dates
a
handful
of
flour
or
some
vegetables
the
other
provinces
after
being
subjected
to
a
careful
survey
were
assessed
partly
in
money
partly
in
kind
according
to
their
natural
capacity
or
wealth
the
smallest
amount
of
revenue
raised
in
any
province
amounted
to
talents
of
silver
the
sum
for
instance
collected
from
arachosia
with
its
dependencies
gedrosia
and
grandara
while
egypt
yielded
a
revenue
of
talents
and
the
amount
furnished
by
babylon
the
wealthiest
province
of
all
amounted
to
talents
the
total
revenue
of
the
empire
reached
the
enormous
sum
estimated
by
weight
of
silver
which
is
equivalent
to
over
of
modern
english
money
if
the
greater
value
of
silver
in
antiquity
is
taken
into
consideration
in
order
to
facilitate
the
collection
of
the
revenue
darius
issued
the
gold
and
silver
coins
which
are
named
after
him
on
the
obverse
side
these
darics
are
stamped
with
a
figure
of
the
sovereign
armed
with
the
bow
or
javelin
they
were
coined
on
the
scale
of
gold
darics
to
one
talent
each
daric
weighing
oz
troy
and
being
worth
exactly
silver
drachmae
or
medic
shekels
so
that
the
relative
value
of
the
two
metals
was
approximately
to
illustration
daric
of
darius
son
of
hystaspes
drawn
by
from
a
specimen
in
the
bibliothèque
nationale
the
most
ancient
type
of
daric
was
thick
and
irregular
in
shape
and
rudely
stamped
but
of
remarkable
fineness
the
amount
of
alloy
being
never
more
than
three
per
cent
the
use
of
this
coinage
was
nowhere
obligatory
and
it
only
became
general
in
the
countries
bordering
on
the
mediterranean
where
it
met
the
requirements
of
international
traffic
and
political
relations
and
in
the
payment
of
the
army
and
the
navy
in
the
interior
the
medium
of
exchange
used
in
wholesale
and
retail
commercial
transactions
continued
to
be
metals
estimated
by
weight
and
the
kings
of
persia
themselves
preferred
to
store
their
revenues
in
the
shape
of
bullion
as
the
metal
was
received
at
the
royal
treasury
it
was
melted
and
poured
into
clay
moulds
and
was
minted
into
money
only
gradually
according
to
the
whim
or
necessity
of
the
moment
arrian
relates
that
alexander
found
weight
of
silver
in
the
treasury
at
susa
other
hoards
quite
as
rich
were
contained
in
the
palaces
of
persepolis
and
pasargadæ
taxes
in
kind
were
levied
even
more
largely
than
in
money
but
the
exact
form
they
assumed
in
the
different
regions
of
the
empire
has
not
yet
been
ascertained
the
whole
empire
was
divided
into
districts
which
were
charged
with
the
victualling
of
the
army
and
the
court
and
babylon
alone
bore
a
third
of
the
charges
under
this
head
we
learn
elsewhere
that
egypt
was
bound
to
furnish
corn
for
the
men
of
the
army
of
occupation
and
that
the
fisheries
of
the
fayum
yielded
the
king
a
yearly
revenue
of
talents
the
medes
furnished
similarly
sheep
mules
and
horses
the
armenians
foals
the
cilicians
white
horses
one
for
each
day
in
the
year
the
babylonians
youthful
eunuchs
and
any
city
or
town
which
produced
or
manufactured
any
valuable
commodity
was
bound
to
furnish
a
regular
supply
to
the
sovereign
thus
chalybon
provided
wine
libya
and
the
oases
salt
india
dogs
with
whose
support
four
large
villages
in
babylonia
were
charged
the
æolian
assos
cheese
and
other
places
in
like
manner
wool
wines
dyes
medicines
and
chemicals
these
imperial
taxes
though
they
seem
to
us
somewhat
heavy
were
not
excessive
but
taken
by
themselves
they
give
us
no
idea
of
the
burdens
which
each
province
had
to
resign
itself
to
bear
the
state
provided
no
income
for
the
satraps
their
maintenance
and
that
of
their
suite
were
charged
on
the
province
and
they
made
ample
exactions
on
the
natives
the
province
of
babylon
was
required
to
furnish
its
satrap
daily
with
an
of
silver
egypt
india
media
and
syria
each
provided
a
no
less
generous
allowance
for
its
governor
and
the
poorest
provinces
were
not
less
heavily
burdened
the
satraps
required
almost
as
much
to
satisfy
their
requirements
as
did
the
king
but
for
the
most
part
they
fairly
earned
their
income
and
saved
more
to
their
subjects
than
they
extorted
from
them
they
repressed
brigandage
piracy
competition
between
the
various
cities
and
local
wars
while
quarrels
which
formerly
would
have
been
settled
by
an
appeal
to
arms
were
now
composed
before
their
and
in
case
of
need
the
rival
factions
were
forcibly
compelled
to
submit
to
their
decisions
they
kept
up
the
roads
and
afforded
complete
security
to
travellers
by
night
and
day
they
protected
industries
and
agriculture
and
in
accordance
with
the
precepts
of
their
religious
code
they
accounted
it
an
honourable
task
to
break
up
waste
land
or
replant
deserted
sites
darius
himself
did
not
disdain
to
send
congratulations
to
a
satrap
who
had
planted
trees
in
asia
minor
and
laid
out
one
of
those
wooded
parks
in
which
the
king
delighted
to
refresh
himself
after
the
fatigues
of
government
by
the
exercise
of
walking
or
in
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
in
spite
of
its
defects
the
system
of
government
inaugurated
by
darius
secured
real
prosperity
to
his
subjects
and
to
himself
a
power
far
greater
than
that
enjoyed
by
any
of
his
predecessors
it
rendered
revolts
on
the
part
of
the
provincial
governors
extremely
difficult
and
enabled
the
court
to
draw
up
a
regular
budget
and
provide
for
its
expenses
without
any
undue
pressure
on
its
subjects
in
one
point
only
was
it
defective
but
that
point
was
a
cardinal
one
namely
in
the
military
organisation
darius
himself
maintained
for
his
personal
protection
a
bodyguard
recruited
from
the
persians
and
the
medes
it
was
divided
into
three
corps
consisting
respectively
of
cavalry
infantry
of
noble
birth
armed
with
lances
whose
shafts
were
ornamented
below
with
apples
of
gold
or
silver
whence
their
name
of
and
under
them
the
in
ten
battalions
the
first
of
which
had
its
lances
ornamented
with
golden
pomegranates
this
guard
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
standing
army
which
could
be
reinforced
by
the
first
and
second
grades
of
persian
and
median
feudal
nobility
at
the
first
summons
forces
of
varying
strength
garrisoned
the
most
important
fortresses
of
the
empire
such
as
sardes
memphis
elephantine
daphnæ
babylon
and
many
others
to
hold
the
restless
natives
in
check
these
were
indeed
the
only
regular
troops
on
which
the
king
could
always
rely
whenever
a
war
broke
out
which
demanded
no
special
effort
the
satraps
of
the
provinces
directly
involved
summoned
the
military
contingents
of
the
cities
and
vassal
states
under
their
control
and
by
concerted
action
endeavoured
to
bring
the
affair
to
a
successful
issue
without
the
necessity
of
an
appeal
to
the
central
authority
if
on
the
contrary
troubles
arose
which
threatened
the
welfare
of
the
whole
empire
and
the
sovereign
felt
called
upon
to
conduct
the
campaign
in
person
he
would
mobilise
his
guard
and
summon
the
reserves
from
several
provinces
or
even
from
all
of
them
veritable
hordes
of
recruits
then
poured
in
but
these
masses
of
troops
differing
from
each
other
in
their
equipment
and
methods
of
fighting
in
disposition
and
in
language
formed
a
herd
of
men
rather
than
an
army
they
had
no
cohesion
or
confidence
in
themselves
and
their
leaders
unaccustomed
to
command
such
enormous
numbers
suffered
themselves
to
be
led

that
in

saw
open
before

a

career
the
circumstances
which
prevented
them
from
following
up
this
preliminary
success
are
unknown
perhaps
the
first
developments
of
nascent
buddhism
deterred
them
but
certain
it
is
that
they
arrested
their
steps
when

had
touched
merely
the
outskirts
of
the
basin
of
the
indus
and
retreated
at

towards
the
west
the
conquest
of
lydia
and
subsequently
of
the
greek
cities
and
islands
along
the
coast
of
the
ægean
had
doubtless
enriched
the
empire
by
the
acquisition
of
active
subject
populations
whose
extraordinary
aptitude
in
the
arts
of
peace
as
well
as
of
war
might
offer
incalculable
resources
to
a
sovereign
who
should
know
how
to
render
them
tractable
and
rule
them
wisely
not
only
did
they
possess
the
elements
of
a
navy
as
enterprising
and
efficacious
as
that
of
the
phoenicians
but
the
perfection
of
their
equipment
and
their
discipline
on
land
rendered
them
always
superior
to
any
asiatic
army
in
whatever
circumstances
unless
they
were
crushed
by
overwhelming
numbers
inquisitive
bold
and
restless
greedy
of
gain
and
inured
to
the
fatigues
and
dangers
of
travel
the
greeks
were
to
be
encountered
everywhere
in
asia
minor
egypt
syria
babylon
and
even
persia
itself
and
it
was
a
greek
we
must
remember
whom
the
great
king
commissioned
to
navigate
the
course
of
the
indus
and
the
waters
of
the
indian
ocean
at
the
same
time
the
very
ardour
of
their
temperament
and
their
consequent
pride
their
impatience
of
all
regular
control
their
habitual
proneness
to
civic
strife
and
to
sanguinary
quarrels
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbouring
cities
rendered
them
the
most
dangerous
subjects
imaginable
to
govern
and
their
loyalty
very
uncertain
moreover
their
admission
as
vassals
of
the
persian
empire
had
not
altered
their
relations
with
european
greece
and
commercial
transactions
between
the
opposite
shores
of
the
ægean
the
travels
of
voyagers
movements
of
mercenaries
and
political
combinations
went
on
as
freely
and
frequently
under
the
satraps
of
sardes
as
under
the
mermnadas
it
was
to
corinth
sparta
and
athens
that
the
families
banished
by
cyrus
after
his
conquest
fled
for
refuge
and
every
time
a
change
of
party
raised
a
new
tyrant
to
power
in
one
of
the
æolian
ionian
or
doric
communities
the
adherents
of
the
deposed
ruler
rushed
in
similar
manner
to
seek
shelter
among
their
friends
across
the
sea
sure
to
repay
their
hospitality
should
occasion
ever
require
it
plots
and
counterplots
were
formed
between
the
two
shores
without
any
one
paying
much
heed
to
the
imperial
authority
of
persia
and
the
constant
support
which
the
subject
greeks
found
among
their
free
brethren
was
bound
before
long
to
rouse
the
anger
of
the
court
at
susa
when
polycrates
foreseeing
the
fall
of
amasis
placed
himself
under
the
suzerainty
of
cambyses
the
corinthians
and
spartans
came
to
besiege
him
in
samos
without
manifesting
any
respect
for
the
great
king
they
failed
in
this
particular
enterprise
but
later
on
after
oroetes
had
been
seized
and
put
to
death
it
was
to
the
spartans
that
the
successor
of
polycrates
maaandrios
applied
for
help
to
assert
his
claim
to
the
possession
of
the
tyranny
against
syloson
brother
of
polycrates
and
a
personal
friend
of
darius
the
date
of
the
death
of
polycrates
must
be
placed
between
that
of
the
conquest
of
egypt
and
that
of
the
revolt
of
gaumâta
either
in
or
the
reinstatement
of
syloson
may
be
placed
in
about
the
time
when
darius
was
completing
the
reorganisation
of
the
empire
and
preparing
to
attack
greece
this
constant
intervention
of
the
foreigner
was
in
evident
contradiction
to
the
spirit
which
had
inspired
the
reorganisation
of
the
empire
just
when
efforts
were
being
made
to
strengthen
the
imperial
power
and
ensure
more
effective
obedience
from
the
provincials
by
the
institution
of
satrapies
it
was
impossible
to
put
up
with
acts
of
unwarrantable
interference
which
would
endanger
the
prestige
of
the
sovereign
and
the
authority
of
his
officers
conquest
presented
the
one
and
only
natural
means
of
escape
from
the
difficulties
of
the
present
situation
and
of
preventing
their
recurrence
when
satraps
should
rule
over
the
european
as
well
as
over
the
asiatic
coasts
of
the
ægean
all
these
turbulent
greeks
would
be
forced
to
live
at
peace
with
one
another
and
in
awe
of
the
sovereign
as
far
as
their
fickle
nature
would
allow
it
was
not
then
as
is
still
asserted
the
mere
caprice
of
a
despot
which
brought
upon
the
greek
world
the
scourge
of
the
persian
wars
but
the
imperious
necessity
of
security
which
obliges
empires
to
subjugate
in
turn
all
the
tribes
and
cities
which
cause
constant
trouble
on

frontiers
darius
who
was
already
ruler
of
a
good
third
of
the
hellenic
world
from
trebizond
to

no
other

the

which
is
by
represents
the
sitting
of
nectanebo
now
in
the
egyptian
museum
at
the
vatican
darius
appears
to
have
formed
this
project
of
conquest
immediately
after
his
first
victories
when
his
initial
attempts
to
institute
satrapies
had
taught
him
not
only
the
condition
and
needs
of
asia
minor
but
of
the
teaching
the
scythians
such
a
lesson
as
would
prevent
them
from
bearing
down
upon
his
right
flank
during
his
march
or
upon
his
rear
while
engaged
in
a
crucial
struggle
in
the
hellenic
peninsula
on
the
other
hand
the
geographical
information
possessed
by
the
persians
with
regard
to
the
danubian
regions
was
of
so
vague
a
character
that
darius
must
have
believed
the
scythians
to
have
been
nearer
to
his
line
of
operations
and
their
country
less
desolate
than
was
really
the
case
a
flotilla
commanded
by
ariaramnes
satrap
of
cappadocia
ventured
across
the
black
sea
in
landed
a
few
thousand
men
upon
the
opposite
shore
and
brought
back
prisoners
who
furnished
those
in
command
with
the
information
they
required
the
motives
imputed
to
darius
by
the
ancients
for
making
this
expedition
are
the
desire
of
avenging
the
disasters
of
the
scythian
invasion
or
of
performing
an
exploit
which
should
render
him
as
famous
as
his
predecessors
in
the
eyes
of
posterity
the
reconnaissance
of
ariaramnes
is
intimately
connected
with
the
expedition
itself
in
ctesias
and
could
have
preceded
it
by
a
few
months
only
if
we
take
for
the
date
of
the
latter
the
year
the
date
given
in
the
table
of
the
capitol
that
of
the
former
can
not
be
earlier
than
ariaramnes
was
not
satrap
of
cappadocia
for
cappadocia
belonged
then
to
the
satrapy
of
daskylion
the
supplementary
paragraphs
of
the
inscription
of
behistun
speak
of
an
expedition
of
darius
against
the
sako
which
is
supposed
to
have
had
as
its
objective
either
the
sea
of
aral
or
the
tigris
would
it
not
be
possible
to
suppose
that
the
sea
mentioned
is
the
pontus
euxinus
and
to
take
the
mutilated
text
of
behistun
to
be
a
description
either
of
the
campaign
beyond
the
danube
or
rather
of
the
preliminary
of
ariaramnes
a
year
before
the
expedition
itself
darius
having
learned
what
he
could
from
these
poor
wretches
crossed
the
bosphorus
in
with
a
body
of
troops
which
tradition
computed
at
conquered
the
eastern
coast
of
thrace
and
won
his
way
in
a
series
of
conflicts
as
far
as
the
ister
the
ionian
sailors
built
for
him
a
bridge
of
boats
which
he
entrusted
to
their
care
and
he
then
started
forward
into
the
steppes
in
search
of
the
enemy
the
scythians
refused
a
pitched
battle
but
they
burnt
the
pastures
before
him
on
every
side
filled
up
the
wells
carried
off
the
cattle
and
then
slowly
retreated
into
the
interior
leaving
darius
to
face
the
vast
extent
of
the
steppes
and
the
terrors
of
famine
later
tradition
stated
that
he
wandered
for
two
months
in
these
solitudes
between
the
ister
and
the
tanais
he
had
constructed
on
the
banks
of
this
latter
river
a
series
of
earthworks
the
remains
of
which
were
shown
in
the
time
of
herodotus
and
had
at
length
returned
to
his
point
of
departure
with
merely
the
loss
of
a
few
sick
men
the
barbarians
stole
a
march
upon
him
and
advised
the
greeks
to
destroy
the
bridge
retire
within
their
cities
and
abandon
the
persians
to
their
fate
the
tyrant
of
the
ohersonnesus
miltiades
the
athenian
was
inclined
to
follow
their
advice
but
histiasus
the
governor
of
miletus
opposed
it
and
eventually
carried
his
point
darius
reached
the
southern
bank
without
difficulty
and
returned
to

limits
the
campaign
beyond
the

neither
the

their
farthest

is
known
the
eight
forts
which
they
were
said
to
have
built
the
ruins
of
which
were
shown
on
the
banks
of
the
oaros
as
late
as
the
time
of
herodotus
were
probably
tumuli
similar
to
those
now
met
with
on
the
russian
steppes
the
origin
of
which
is
ascribed
by
the
people
to
persons
celebrated
in
their
history
or
traditions
the
greek
towns
of
thrace
thought
themselves
rid
of
him
and
rose
in
revolt
but
he
left
men
in
europe
who
at
first
under
megabyzos
and
then
under
otanes
reduced
them
to
subjection
one
after
another
and
even
obliged
amyntas
the
king
of
macedonia
to
become
a
tributary
of
the
empire
the
expedition
had
not
only
failed
to
secure
the
submission
of
the
scythians
but
apparently
provoked
reprisals
on
their
part
and
several
of
their
bands
penetrated
ere
long
into
the
chersonnesus
it
nevertheless
was
not
without
solid
result
for
it
showed
that
darius
even
if
he
could
not
succeed
in
subjugating
the
savage
danubian
tribes
had
but
little
to
fear
from
them
it
also
secured
for
him
a
fresh
province
that
of
thrace
and
by
the
possession
of
macedonia
brought
his
frontier
into
contact
with
northern
greece
the
overland
route
in
any
case
the
more
satisfactory
of
the
two
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
invader
revolutions
at
athens
prevented
him
from
setting
out
on
his
expedition
as
soon
as
he
had
anticipated
hippias
had
been
overthrown
in
and
having
taken
refuge
at
sigoum
was
seeking
on
all
sides
for
some
one
to
avenge
him
against
his
the
satrap
of
sardes
declined
at
first
to
listen
to
him
for
he
hoped
that
the
athenians
themselves
would
appeal
to
him
without
his
being
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
their
former
tyrant
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
sent
him
an
embassy
and
begged
his
help
against
the
spartans
he
promised
it
on
condition
that
they
would
yield
the
traditional
homage
of
earth
and
water
and
their
delegates
complied
with
his
demand
though
on
their
return
to
athens
they
were
disowned
by
the
citizens
artaphernes
disappointed
in
this
direction
now
entered
into
communications
with
hippias
and
such
close
relations
soon
existed
between
the
two
that
the
athenians
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
two
years
later
they
again
despatched
fresh
deputies
to
sardes
to
beg
the
satrap
not
to
espouse
the
cause
of
their
former
ruler
for
a
reply
the
satrap
summoned
them
to
recall
the
exiles
and
on
their
refusing
their
city
became
thenceforward
the
ostensible
objective
of
the
persian
army
and
fleet
the
partisans
of
hippias
within
the
town
were
both
numerous
and
active
it
was
expected
that
they
would
rise
and
hand
over
the
city
as
soon
as
their
chief
should
land
on
a
point
of
territory
with
a
force
sufficient
to
intimidate
the
opposing
faction
athens
in
the
hands
of
hippias
would
mean
athens
in
the
hands
of
the
persians
and
greece
accessible
to
the
persian
hordes
at
all
times
by
the
shortest
route
darius
therefore
prepared
to
make
the
attempt
and
in
order
to
guard
against
any
mishap
he
caused
all
the
countries
that
he
was
about
to
attack
to
be
explored
beforehand
spies
attached
to
his
service
were
sent
to
scour
the
coasts
of
the
peloponnesus
and
take
note
of
all
its
features
the
state
of
its
ports
the
position
of
the
islands
and
the
fortresses
and
they
penetrated
as
far
as
italy
if
we
may
believe
the
story
subsequently
told
to
herodotus
herodotus
fixes
the
date
at
the
time
when
the
athenians
first
ostracised
the
principal
partisans
of
the
pisistratids
and
amongst
others
hipparchus
son
of
charmes
in
herodotus
said
that
darius
sent
spies
with
the
physician
democedes
of
crotona
shortly
before
the
scythian
expedition
while
he
thus
studied
the
territory
from
a
distance
he
did
not
neglect
precautions
nearer
to
hand
but
ordered
the
milesians
to
occupy
in
his
name
the
principal
stations
of
the
ægean
between
ionia
and
attica
histiasus
whose
loyalty
had
stood
darius
in
such
good
stead
at
the
bridge
over
the
danube
did
not
however
appear
to
him
equal
to
so
delicate
a
task
the
king
summoned
him
to
susa
on
some
slight
pretext
loaded
him
with
honours
and
replaced
him
by
his
nephew
aristagoras
aristagoras
at
once
attempted
to
justify
the
confidence
placed
in
him
by
taking
possession
of
naxos
but
the
surprise
that
he
had
prepared
ended
in
failure
discontent
crept
in
among
his
men
and
after
a
fruitless
siege
of
four
months
he
was
obliged
to
withdraw
his
failure
changed
the
tide
of
affairs
he
was
afraid
that
the
persians
would
regard
it
as
a
crime
and
this
fear
prompted
him
to
risk
everything
to
save
his
fortune
and
his
life
he
retired
from
his
office
as
tyrant
exhorted
the
milesians
who
were
henceforth
free
to
do
so
to
make
war
on
the
barbarians
and
seduced
from
their
allegiance
the
crews
of
the
vessels
just
returned
from
naxos
and
still
lying
in
the
mouths
of
the
meander
the
tyrants
who
commanded
them
were
seized
some
exiled
and
some
put
to
death
the
æolians
soon
made
common
cause
with
their
neighbours
the
ionians
and
by
the
last
days
of
autumn
the
whole
of
the
ægean
littoral
was
under
arms
herodotus
attributes
an
unlikely
act
of
treachery
to
megabates
the
persian
who
was
commanding
the
iranian
contingent
attached
to
the
ionian
troops
the
dorian
cities
took
no
part
in
the
revolt
at
least
herodotus
never
mentions
them
among
the
confederates
the
three
ionian
cities
of
ephesus
kolophon
and
lebedos
also
seem
to
have
remained
aloof
and
we
know
that
the
ephesians
were
not
present
at
the
battle
of
ladê
from
the
outset
aristagoras
realised
that
they
would
be
promptly
overcome
if
asiatic
hellas
were
not
supported
by
hellas
in
europe
while
the
lydian
satrap
was
demanding
reinforcements
from
his
sovereign
aristagoras
therefore
repaired
to
the
peloponnesus
as
a
suppliant
for
help
sparta
embroiled
in
one
of
her
periodical
quarrels
with
argos
gave
him
an
insolent
refusal
even
athens
where
the
revolution
had
for
the
moment
relieved
her
from
the
fear
of
the
pisistratidaa
and
the
terrors
of
a
barbarian
invasion
granted
him
merely
twenty
triremes
enough
to
draw
down
reprisals
on
her
immediately
after
their
defeat
without
sensibly
augmenting
the
chances
of
success
to
the
athenian
contingent
bretria
added
five
vessels
and
this
comprised
his
whole
force
the
leaders
of
the
movement
did
not
hesitate
to
assume
the
offensive
with
these
slender
resources
as
early
as
the
spring
of
before
artaphernes
had
received
reinforcements
they
marched
suddenly
on
sardes
they
burnt
the
lower
town
but
as
on
many
previous
occasions
the
citadel
held
out
after
having
encamped
for
several
days
at
the
foot
of
its
rock
they
returned
to
ephesus
laden
with
the
spoil
aristagoras
had
with
him
a
map
of
the
world
engraved
on
a
bronze
plate
which
was
probably
a
copy
of
the
chart
drawn
up
by
hecatseus
of
miletus
herodotus
says
that
the
ionians
on
their
return
suffered
a
serious
reverse
near
ephesus
the
author
seems
to
have
adopted
some
lydian
or
persian
tradition
hostile
to
the
ionians
for
charon
of
lampsacus
who
lived
nearer
to
the
time
of
these
events
mentions
only
the
retreat
and
hints
at
no
defeat
if
the
expedition
had
really
ended
in
this
disaster
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
the
revolt
would
have
attained
the
dimensions
it
did
immediately
afterwards
this
indeed
was
a
check
to
their
hostilities
and
such
an
abortive
attempt
was
calculated
to
convince
them
of
their
powerlessness
against
the
foreign
rule
none
the
less
however
when
it
was
generally
known
that
they
had
burnt
the
capital
of
asia
minor
and
had
with
impunity
made
the
representative
of
the
great
king
feel
in
his
palace
the
smoke
of
the
conflagration
the
impression
was
such
as
actual
victory
could
have
produced
the
cities
which
had
hitherto
hesitated
to
join
them
now
espoused
their
cause
the
ports
of
the
troad
and
the
hellespont
lycia
the
carians
and
cyprus
and
their
triumph
would
possibly
have
been
secured
had
greece
beyond
the
ægean
followed
the
general
movement
and
joined
the
coalition
sparta
however
persisted
in
her
indifference
and
athens
took
the
opportunity
of
withdrawing
from
the
struggle
the
asiatic
greeks
made
as
good
a
defence
as
they
could
but
their
resources
fell
far
short
of
those
of
the
enemy
and
they
could
do
no
more
than
delay
the
catastrophe
and
save
their
honour
by
their
bravery
cyprus
was
the
first
to
yield
during
the
winter
of
its
vessels
in
conjunction
with
those
of
the
ionians
dispersed
the
fleet
of
the
phoenicians
off
salamis
but
the
troops
of
their
princes
still
imbued
with
the
old
system
of
military
tactics
could
not
sustain
the
charge
of
the
persian
battalions
they
gave
way
under
the
walls
of
salamis
and
their
chief
onesilus
was
killed
in
a
final
charge
of
his
chariotry
the
movement
in
cyprus
must
have
begun
in
the
winter
of
for
onesilus
was
already
in
the
field
when
darius
heard
of
the
burning
of
sardes
and
as
it
lasted
for
a
year
it
must
have
been
quelled
in
the
winter
of
his
death
effected
the
ruin
of
the
ionian
cause
in
cyprus
which
on
the
continent
suffered
at
the
same
time
no
less
serious
reverses
the
towns
of
the
hellespont
and
of
æolia
succumbed
one
after
another
kymê
and
clazomenæ
next
opened
their
gates
the
carians
were
twice
beaten
once
near
the
white
columns
and
again
near
labranda
and
their
victory
at
pedasos
suspended
merely
for
an
instant
the
progress
of
the
persian
arms
so
that
towards
the
close
of
the
struggle
was
almost
entirely
concentrated
round
miletus
aristagoras
seeing
that
his
cause
was
now
desperate
agreed
with
his
partisans
that
they
should
expatriate
themselves
he
fell
fighting
against
the
edonians
of
thrace
attempting
to
force
the
important
town
of
enneahodoi
near
the
mouth
of
the
strymon
but
his
defection
had
not
discouraged
any
one
and
histiseus
who
had
been
sent
to
sardes
by
the
great
king
to
negotiate
the
submission
of
the
rebels
failed
in
his
errand
even
when
blockaded
on
the
land
side
miletus
could
defy
an
attack
so
long
as
communication
with
the
sea
was
not
cut
off
in
herodotus
the
town
is
not
named
but
a
passage
in
thucydides
shows
that
it
was
enneahodoi
afterwards
amphipolis
and
that
the
death
of
aristagoras
took
place
years
before
the
athenian
defeat
at
drabeskos
probably
in
illustration
a
cypriot
chariot
drawn
by
from
the
group
in
the
new
york
museum
darius
therefore
brought
up
the
phoenician
fleet
reinforced
it
with
the
cypriot
contingents
and
despatched
the
united
squadrons
to
the
archipelago
during
the
summer
of
the
confederates
even
after
the
disasters
of
the
preceding
years
still
possessed
vessels
most
of
them
of
to
oars
they
were
however
completely
defeated
near
the
small
island
of
ladê
in
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
and
miletus
from
that
moment
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
capitulated
a
few
weeks
later
a
small
proportion
of
its
inhabitants
continued
to
dwell
in
the
ruined
city
but
the
greater
number
were
carried
away
to
ampê
at
the
mouth
of
the
tigris
in
the
marshes
of
the
the
year
three
years
before
the
capture
of
the
town
appears
to
be
an
unlikely
date
for
the
battle
of
ladê
miletus
must
have
fallen
in
the
autumn
or
winter
months
following
the
defeat
caria
was
reconquered
during
the
winter
of
and
by
the
early
part
of
chios
lesbos
tenedos
the
cities
of
the
chersonnesus
and
of
propontis
in
short
all
which
yet
held
out
were
reduced
to
obedience
artaphernes
reorganised
his
vanquished
states
entirely
in
the
interest
of
persia
he
did
not
interfere
with
the
constitutions
of
the
several
republics
but
he
reinstated
the
tyrants
he
regulated
and
augmented
the
various
tributes
prohibited
private
wars
and
gave
to
the
satrap
the
right
of
disposing
of
all
quarrels
at
his
own
tribunal
the
measures
which
he
adopted
had
long
after
his
day
the
force
of
law
among
the
asiatic
greeks
and
it
was
by
them
they
regulated
their
relations
with
the
representatives
of
the
great
king
if
darius
had
ever
entertained
doubts
as
to
the
necessity
for
occupying
european
greece
to
ensure
the
preservation
of
peace
in
her
asiatic
the
revolt
of
ionia
must
have
completely
dissipated
them
it
was
a
question
whether
the
cities
which
had
so
obstinately
defied
him
for
six
long
years
would
ever
resign
themselves
to
servitude
as
long
as
they
saw
the
peoples
of
their
race
maintaining
their
independence
on
the
opposite
shores
of
the
ægean
and
while
the
misdeeds
of
which
the
contingents
of
eretria
and
athens
had
been
guilty
during
the
rebellion
remained
unpunished
a
tradition
which
sprang
up
soon
after
the
event
related
that
on
hearing
of
the
burning
of
sardes
darius
had
bent
his
bow
and
let
fly
an
arrow
towards
the
sky
praying
zeus
to
avenge
him
on
the
athenians
and
at
the
same
time
he
had
commanded
one
of
his
slaves
to
repeat
three
times
a
day
before
him
at
every
meal
remember
the
athenians
the
legend
is
clearly
older
than
the
time
of
herodotus
for
in
the
of
eschylus
the
shade
of
darius
when
coming
out
of
his
tomb
cries
to
the
old
men
athens
and
greece
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
intermeddling
of
these
strangers
between
the
sovereign
and
his
subjects
was
at
once
a
serious
insult
to
the
achæmenids
and
a
cause
of
anxiety
to
the
empire
to
leave
it
unpunished
would
have
been
an
avowal
of
weakness
or
timidity
which
would
not
fail
to
be
quickly
punished
in
syria
egypt
babylon
and
on
the
scythian
frontiers
and
would
ere
long
give
rise
to
similar
acts
of
revolt
and
interference
darius
therefore
resumed
his
projects
but
with
greater
activity
than
before
and
with
a
resolute
purpose
to
make
a
final
reckoning
with
the
greeks
whatever
it
might
cost
him
the
influence
of
his
nephew
mardonius
at
first
inclined
him
to
adopt
the
overland
route
and
he
sent
him
into
thrace
with
a
force
of
men
and
a
fleet
of
galleys
sufficient
to
overcome
all
obstacles
mardonius
marched
against
the
greek
colonies
and
native
tribes
which
had
throw
off
the
yoke
during
the
ionian
war
and
reduced
those
who
had
still
managed
to
preserve
their
independence
the
bryges
opposed
him
with
such
determination
that
summer
was
drawing
to
its
close
before
he
was
able
to
continue
his
march
he
succeeded
however
in
laying
hands
on
macedonia
and
obliged
its
king
alexander
to
submit
to
the
conditions
accepted
by
his
father
amyntas
but
at
this
juncture
half
of
his
fleet
was
destroyed
by
a
tempest
in
the
vicinity
of
mount
athos
and
the
disaster
which
took
place
just
as
winter
was
approaching
caused
him
to
suspend
his
operations
he
was
recalled
on
account
of
his
failure
and
the
command
was
transferred
to
datis
the
mede
and
to
the
persian
artaphernes
darius
however
while
tentatively
using
the
land
routes
through
greece
for
his
expeditions
had
left
no
stone
unturned
to
secure
for
himself
that
which
would
carry
him
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
position
and
he
had
opened
negotiations
with
the
republics
of
greece
proper
several
of
them
had
consented
to
tender
him
earth
and
water
among
them
being
ægina
and
besides
this
the
state
of
the
various
factions
in
athens
was
such
that
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
could
count
on
the
support
of
a
large
section
of
the
population
when
the
day
came
for
him
to
disembark
his
force
on
the
shores
of
attica
herodotus
states
that
the
greeks
submitted
to
the
great
king
but
herodotus
himself
says
later
on
that
the
people
of
naxos
at
all
events
proved

therefore
decided
to

he
employed
the
year
in
concentrating
his
troops

in

at

from

sailed

in

his

set
out
forty
years
before
to
return
to

what
took
place
at
the
end
of
this
time
is
uncertain
whether
datis
grew
tired
of
inaction
or
whether
he
suddenly
resolved
to
send
part
of

forces
by

so
as
to
land
on

hoisted
on

to
attract

attention

set

the
next

turning

no

any

was
at
work

returned
to

datis
on
entering
the
roads

found
the
shore
defended
and
the

that
he
had
left
at

cruised
about
for

made

to

he
turned
his

the
material
loss
to
the

was
inconsiderable
for
even
the
cyclades
remained
under

authority
miltiades
who
endeavoured
to
retake
them
met
with
a
reverse
before
paros

the
athenians
disappointed
by
his
unsuccessful
attempt
made
no
further
efforts
to
regain
them
the
moral
effect
of
the
victory
on

was
extraordinary
up
till
then
the
median
soldiers
had
been
believed
to
be
the
only
invincible
troops
in
the
world
the
sight
of
them
alone
excited
dread
in
the
bravest
hearts
and
their
name
was
received
everywhere
with
reverential
awe
but
now
a
handful
of
hoplites
from
one
of
the
towns
of
the
continent
and
that
not
the
most
renowned
for
its
prowess
without
cavalry
or
bowmen
had
rushed
upon
and
overthrown
the
most
terrible
of
all
oriental
battalions
the
persians
and
the
sakæ
darius
could
not
put
up
with
such
an
affront
without
incurring
the
risk
of
losing
his
prestige
with
the
people
of
asia
and
europe
who
up
till
then
had
believed
him
and
of
thus
exposing
himself
to
the
possibility
of
revolutions
in
recently
subdued
countries
such
as
egypt
which
had
always
retained
the
memory
of
her
past
greatness
in
the
interest
of
his
own
power
as
well
as
to
soothe
his
wounded
pride
a
renewed
attack
was
imperative
and
this
time
it
must
be
launched
with
such
dash
and
vigour
that
all
resistance
would
be
at
once
swept
before
it
events
had
shown
him
that
the
influence
of
the
pisistratidæ
had
not
been
strong
enough
to
secure
for
him
the
opening
of
the
gates
of
athens
and
that
the
sea
route
did
not
permit
of
his
concentrating
an
adequate
force
of
cavalry
and
infantry
on
the
field
of
battle
he
therefore
reverted
to
the
project
of
an
expedition
by
the
overland
route
skirting
the
coasts
of
thrace
and
macedonia
during
three
years
he
collected
arms
provisions
horses
men
and
vessels
and
was
ready
to
commence
hostilities
in
the
spring
of
when

in

undeniably

on
the
confines
of

in
the

outside
these

where
the

of
the
great
king
was
exercised
in
a
direct
manner
the
ancient
feudal
organisation
existed
intact
the
temples
retained
their
possessions
and
their
vassals
and
the
nobles
within
their
principalities
were
as
independent
and
as
inclined
to
insurrection
as
in
past
times
the
annual
tribute
the
heaviest
paid
by
any
province
with
the
exception
of
cossæa
and
assyria
amounted
only
to
talents
of
silver
to
this
sum
must
be
added
the
farming
of
the
fishing
in
lake
moeris
which
according
to
herodotus
brought
in
one
talent
a
day
during
the
six
months
of
the
high
nile
but
according
to
diodorus
during
the
whole
year
as
well
as
the
medimni
of
wheat
required
for
the
army
of
occupation
and
the
obligation
to
furnish
the
court
of
susa
with
libyan
nitre
and
nile
water
the
total
of
these
impositions
was
far
from
constituting
a
burden
disproportionate
to
the
wealth
of
the
nile
valley
the
nubian
tribes
who
are
called
ethiopians
by
herodotus
and
the
cuneiform
inscriptions
paid
no
regular
tribute

were
obliged
to
send
annually
two
chænikes
of
pure
gold
two
hundred
pieces
of
ebony
twenty
tusks
and
five
young
slaves
all
under
the
name
of
a
free
gift
herodotus
states
that
in
his
own
time
the
persians
like
the
saite
pharaohs
still
had
garrisons
at
daphnæ
and
at
elephantine
herodotus
says
that
the
produce
sank
to
the
value
of
a
third
of

day
during
the
six
other

that

was
no
less
a
general
by
instinct
and
training
than
they
as
is
proved
by
the
campaigns
which
procured
him
his
crown

after
having
conquered
he
knew
how
to

the

of

for

according

had
to

intreated

to
choose

request

khshayarsha
ascended

throne
his
brothers
offered
no
opposition

nobles
did
homage

the

called
xerxes
was
at
that

of
age
he
was
tall
vigorous
of
an
imposing
figure
and
noble
countenance
and
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
handsomest
man
of
his
time
but
neither
his
intelligence
nor
disposition
corresponded
to
his
outward
appearance
he
was
at
once
violent
and
feeble
indolent
and
sensual
and
was
easily
swayed
by
his
courtiers
and
mistresses
the
idea
of
a
war
had
no
attractions
for
him
and
he
was
inclined
to
shirk
it
his
uncle
artabanus
exhorted
him
to
follow
his
inclination
for
peace
and
he
lent
a
favourable
ear
to
his
advice
until
his
cousin
mardonius
remonstrated
with
him
and
begged
him
not
to
leave
the
disgrace
of
marathon
unpunished
or
he
would
lower
the
respect
attached
to
the
name
of

at

to
bring

khabbîsha
had
done
his
best
to
prepare
a
stormy
reception
for
him
during
a
period
of
two
years
khabbîsha
had
worked
at
the
extension
of
the
entrenchments
along
the
coast
and
at
the
mouths
of
the
nile
in
order
to
repulse
the
attack
that
he
foresaw
would
take
place
simultaneously

his
precautions
proved
fruitless

was
buried
by
khabbîsha
in

in
the
second
year
of
his
reign

proves
that
he
was
in

the

had
perhaps
been
deprived
of
its
garrison

to
reinforce
the
army
prepared
against

it

possibly
thus
that
it
fell

khabbîsha
order
was
once
more
restored
but
he
was
not
yet
entirely
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
own
plan
of
action
classical
tradition
tells
us
that
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
babylon
he
had
offended
the
religious
prejudices
of
the
chaldæans
by
a
sacrilegious
curiosity
he
had
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
the
priests
forced
an
entrance
into
the
ancient
of
and
had
beheld
the
body
of
the
old
hero
preserved
in
oil
in
a
glass
sarcophagus
which
however
was
not
quite
full
of
the
liquid
a
notice
posted
up
beside
it
threatened
the
king
who
should
violate
the
secret
of
the
tomb
with
a
cruel
fate
unless
he
filled
the
sarcophagus
to
the
brim
and
xerxes
had
attempted
to
accomplish
this
mysterious
injunction
but
all
his
efforts
had
failed
the
example
set
by
egypt
and
the
change
of
sovereign
are
sufficient
to
account
for
the
behaviour
of
the
babylonians
they
believed
that
the
accession
of
a
comparatively
young
monarch
and
the
difficulties
of
the
campaign
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
afforded
them
a
favourable
occasion
for
throwing
off
the
yoke
they
elected
as
king
a
certain
shamasherib
whose
antecedents
are
unknown
but
their
independence
was
of
short
duration
for
megabyzos
son
of
zopyrus
who
governed
the
province
by
hereditary
right
forced
them
to
disarm
after
a
siege
of
a
few
months
this
shamasherib
is
mentioned
only
on
a
contract
dated
from
his
accession
which
is
preserved
in
the
british
museum
it
would
appear
that
xerxes
treated
them
with
the
greatest
severity
he
pillaged
the
treasury
and
temple
of
bel
appropriated
the
golden
statue
which
decorated
the
great
inner
hall
of
the
ziggurât
and
carried
away
many
of
the
people
into
captivity
babylon
never
recovered
this
final
blow
the
quarters
of
the
town
that
had
been
pillaged
remained
uninhabited
and
fell
into
ruins
commerce
dwindled
and
industry
flagged
the
counsellors
of
xerxes
had
no
doubt
wished
to
give
an
to
the
province
by
their
treatment
of
babylon
and
thus
prevent
the
possibility
of
a
revolution
taking
place
in
asia
while
its
ruler
was
fully
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
the
greeks
meanwhile
all
preparations
were
completed
and
the
contingents
of
the
eastern
and
southern
provinces
concentrated
at
kritalla
in
cappadocia
merely
awaited
the
signal
to
set
out
xerxes
gave
the
order
to
advance
in
the
autumn

crossed
the
halys
and
took
up
his
quarters
at
sardes

prepared

ports

and

diodorus
who
probably
follows

is
the
only
writer
who
informs
us
of
the
place
where
the
fleet
was
assembled
gathered
together
in
that
little
corner
of
the
world
were
forces
such
as
no
king
had
ever
before
united
under
his
command
they
comprised
vessels
of
various
build
and
probably
combatants
besides
the
rabble
of
servants
hucksters
and
women
which
followed
all
the
armies
of
that
period
the
greeks
exaggerated
the
number
of
the
force
beyond
all
probability
they
estimated
it
variously
at
at
and
at
men
of
whom
were
and
of
them
horsemen
herodotus
records
the
epigram
to
the
effect
that
men
attacked
thermopylæ

the
idea
of
a
trireme
going
at

speed
the
troops
which
they
could
bring
up
to
oppose
these
hordes
were
indeed
so
slender
in
number
when
reckoned
severally
that
all
hope
of
success
seemed
impossible
xerxes
once
more
summoned
the
greeks
to
submit
and
most
of
the
republics
appeared
inclined
to
comply
athens
and
sparta
alone
refused
but
from
different
motives
athens
knew
that
after
the
burning
of
sardes
and
the
victory
of
marathon
they
could
hope
for
no
pity
and
she
was
well
aware
that
persia
had
decreed
her
complete
destruction
the
athenians
were
familiar
with
the
idea
of
a
struggle
in
which
their
very
existence
was
at
stake
and
they
counted
on
the
navy
with
which
themistocles
had
just
provided
them
to
enable
them
to
emerge
from
the
affair
with
honour
sparta
was
not
threatened
with
the
same
fate
but
she
was
at
that
time
the
first
military
state
in
greece
and
the
whole
of
the
peloponnesus
acknowledged
her
sway
in
the
event
of
her
recognising
the
suzerainty
of
the
barbarians
the
latter
would
not
fail
to
require
of
her
the
renunciation
of
her
hegemony
and
she
would
then
be
reduced
to
the
same
rank
as
her
former
rivals
tegea
and
argos
athens
and
sparta
therefore
united
to
repulse
the
common
enemy
and
the
advantage
that
this
alliance
afforded
them
was
so
patent
that
none
of
the
other
states
ventured
to
declare
openly
for
the
great
king
argos
and
crete
the
boldest
of
them
announced
that
they
would
observe
neutrality
the
remainder
thessalians
boeotians
and
people
of
corcyra
gave
their
support
to
the
national
cause
but
did
so
unwillingly
xerxes
crossed
the
hellespont
in
the
spring
of
by
two
bridges
of
boats
thrown
across
it
between
abydos
and
sestos
he
then
formed
his
force
into
three
columns
and
made
his
way
slowly
along
the
coast
protected
on
the
left
by
the
whole
of
his
fleet
from
any
possible
attack
by
the
squadrons
of
the
enemy
the
greeks
had
three
lines
of
defence
which
they
could
hold
against
him
the
natural
strength
of
which
nearly
compensated
them
for
the
inferiority
of
their
forces
these
were
mount
olympus
mount
oeta
and
the
isthmus
of
corinth
the
first
however
was
untenable
owing
to
the
ill
will
of
the
thessalians
as
a
precautionary
measure
hoplites
were
encamped
upon
it
but
they
evacuated
the
position
as
soon
as
the
came
into
sight
the
natural
barrier
of
oeta
less
formidable
than
that
of
olympus
was
flanked
by
the
euboean
straits
on
the
extreme
right
but
the
range
was
of
such
extent
that
it
did
not
require
to
be
guarded
with
equal
vigilance
along
its
whole
length
the
spartans
did
not
at
first
occupy
it
for
they
intended
to
accumulate
all
the
greek
forces
both
troops
and
vessels
around
the
isthmus
at
that
point
the
neck
of
land
was
so
narrow
and
the
sea
so
shut
in
that
the
numbers
of
the
invading
force
proved
a
drawback
to
them
and
the
advantage
almost
of
necessity
lay
with
that
of
the
two
adversaries
who
should
be
best
armed
and
best
officered
this
plan
of
the
spartans
was
a
wise
one
but
athens
which
was
thereby
sacrificed
to
the
general
good
refused
to
adopt
it
and
as
she
alone
furnished
almost
half
the
total
number
of
vessels
her
decision
had
to
be
deferred
to
a
body
of
about
hoplites
was
therefore
posted
in
the
pass
of
thermopylæ
under
the
command
of
leonidas
while
a
squadron
of
vessels
disposed
themselves
near
the
promontory
of
artemision
off
the
euripus
and
protected
the
right
flank
of
the
pass
against
a
diversion
from
the
fleet
meanwhile
xerxes
had
been
reinforced
in
the
course
of
his
march
by
the
contingents
from
macedonia
and
had
received
the
homage
of
the
cities
of
thessaly
having
reached
the
defiles
of
the
oeta
and
the
euboea
he
began
by
attacking
the
creeks
directly
in
front
both
fleets
and
armies
facing
one
another
leonidas
succeeded
in
withstanding
the
assault
on
two
successive
days
and
then
the
inevitable
took
place
a
detachment
of
persians
guided
by
the
natives
of
the
country
emerged
by
a
path
which
had
been
left
unguarded
and
bore
down
upon
the
greeks
in
the
rear
a
certain
number
managed
to
escape
but
the
bulk
of
the
force
along
with
the
spartans
and
their
king
succumbed
after
a
desperate
resistance
as
for
the
fleet
it
had
borne
itself
bravely
and
had
retained
the
ascendency
throughout
in
spite
of
the
superiority
of
the
numbers
on
hearing
the
news
of
the
glorious
death
of
leonidas
they
believed
their
task
ended
for
the
time
being
and
retired
with
the
athenians
in
their
wake
ready
to
sustain
the
attack
should
they
come
again
to
close
quarters
the
victorious
side
had
suffered
considerable
losses
in
men
and
vessels
but
they
had
forced
the
passage
and
central
greece
now
lay
at
their
mercy
xerxes
received
the
submission
of
the
thebans
the
phocæans
the
locrians
the
dorians
and
of
all
who
appealed
to
his
clemency
then
having
razed
to
the
ground
platæa
and
thespisæ
the
only
two
towns
which
refused
to
come
to
terms
with
him
he
penetrated
into
attica
by
the
gorges
of
the
cithssron
the
population
had
taken
refuge
in
salamis
ægina
and
troezen
the
few
fanatics
who
refused
to
desist
in
their
defence
of
the
acropolis
soon
perished
behind
their
ramparts
xerxes
destroyed
the
temple
of
pallas
by
fire
to
avenge
the
burning
of
sardes
and
then
entrenched
his
troops
on
the
approaches
to
the
isthmus
stationing
his
squadrons
in
the
ports
of
munychia
phalerum
and
the
piræus
and
suspended
all
hostilities
while
waiting
to
see
what
policy
the
greeks
would
pursue
it
is
possible
that
he
hoped
that
a
certain
number
of
them
would
intreat
for
mercy
and
others
being
encouraged
by
their
example
to
submit
no
further
serious
battle
would
have
to
be
fought
when
he
found
that
no
such
request
was
proffered
he
determined
to
take
advantage
of
the
superiority
of
his
numbers
and
if
possible
destroy
at
one
blow
the
whole
of
the
greek
naval
reserve
he
therefore
gave
orders
to
his
admirals
to
assume
the
offensive
the
greek
fleet
lay
at
anchor
across
the
bay
of
salamis
the
left
squadron
of
the
persians
leaving
munychia
in
the
middle
of
the
night

for
the
promontory
of
cynosura

troops

it

it
was
proposed
to
fall
back
in

of
accident
while
the
right
division
sailing
close
to
the
coast
of
attica
closed
the
entrance
to
the
straits
in
the
direction
of
eleusis
this
double
movement
was
all
but
completed
when
the
greeks
were
informed
by
fugitives
of
what
was
taking
place
and
the
engagement
was
inevitable
they
accepted
it
fearlessly

enthroned
with
his
immortals
on

position

were
so
considerable
that

exhausted
xerxes
at
first
showed
signs
of
wishing
to
continue
the
struggle
he
repaired
the
injured
vessels
and
ordered
a
dyke
to
be
constructed
which
by
uniting
salamis
to
the
mainland
would
enable
him
to
oust
the
athenians
from

last
retreat
but
he
had
never
exhibited
much
zest
for
the
war
the
inevitable
fatigues
and
dangers
of
a
campaign
were
irksome
to
his
indolent
nature
and
winter
was
approaching
which
he
would
be
obliged
to
spend
far
from
susa
in
the
midst
of
a
country
wasted
and
trampled
underfoot
by
two
great
armies
mardonius
guessing
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
advised
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
fine
autumn
weather
to
return
to
sardes
he
proposed
to
take
over
from
xerxes
the
command
of
the
army
in
greece
and
to
set
to
work
to
complete
the
conquest
of
the
peloponnesus
he
was
probably
glad
to
be
rid
of
a
sovereign
whose
luxurious
habits
were
a
hindrance
to
his
movements
xerxes
accepted
his
proposal
with
evident
satisfaction
and
summarily
despatching
his
vessels
to
the
hellespont
to
guard
the
bridges
he
set
out
on

return
journey
by
the
overland
route
at
the
time
of

departure
the
issue
of

mardonius
evacuated
attica
which
was
too
poor
and
desolate
a
country
to
support
so
large
an
army
and
occupied
comfortable
winter
quarters
in
the
rich
plains
of
thessaly
where
he
recruited
his
strength
for
a
supreme
effort
in
the
spring
he
had
with
him
about
men
picked
troops
from

besides
the

themselves
by
their
bravery
at

the
heavy
hoplites
of

and
of
the
boeotian
towns
the
thessalian
cavalry
and
the
battalions
of
macedonia
were
also
in
readiness
to
join
him
as
soon
as
called
on
the
whole
of
these
troops
relieved
from
the
presence

the
useless
multitude
which
had
impeded
its

by
a
bold
and
active
general

anxious
to
distinguish
themselves
and
the
probabilities
of
their
final
success
were
great
the
confederates
were
aware
of
the
fact
and
although
resolved
to
persevere
to
the
end
their
maoeuvres
betrayed
an
unfortunate
indecision
their

followed

that

enemy
were
not
planning
a
diversion
against
the
peloponnesus
they
put
about
and
returned
to
their
various
ports
the
winter
was
passed
in
preparations
on
both
sides
xerxes
on
his
return
to
sardes
had
got
together
a
fleet
of
triremes
and
an
army
of
men
and
had
stationed
them
at
cape
mycale
opposite
samos
to
be
ready
in
case
of
an
ionian
revolt
or
perhaps
to
bear
down
upon
any
given
point
in
the
peloponnesus
when
mardonius
had
gained
some
initial
advantage
the
lacædemonians
on
their
part
seem
to
have
endeavoured
to
assume
the
defensive
both
by
land
and
sea
while
their
were
assembling
in
the
neighbourhood
of
corinth
their
fleet
sailed
as
far
as
delos
and
there
anchored
as
reluctant
to
venture
beyond
as
if
it
had
been
a
question
of
proceeding
to
the
pillars
of
hercules
athens
which
ran
the
risk
of
falling
into
the
hands
for
the
second
time
through
these
hesitations
evinced
such
marked
displeasure
that
mardonius
momentarily
attempted
to
take
advantage
of
it
he
submitted
to
the
citizens
through
alexander
king
of
macedon
certain
conditions
the
leniency
of
which
gave
uneasiness
to
the
spartans
the
latter
at
once
promised
athens
all
she
wanted
and
on
the
strength
of
their
oaths
she
at
once
broke
off
the
negotiations
with
the
persians
mardonius
immediately
resolved
on
action
he
left
his
quarters
in
thessaly
in
the
early
days
of
may
reached
attica
by
a
few
quick
marches
and
spread
his
troops
over
the
country
before
the
peloponnesians
were
prepared
to
resist
the
people
again
took
refuge
in
salamis
the
persians
occupied
athens
afresh
and
once
more
had
recourse
to
diplomacy
this
time
the
spartans
were
alarmed
to
good
purpose
they
set
out
to
the
help
of
their
ally
and
from
that
moment
mardonius
showed
no
further
consideration
in
his
dealing
with
athens
he
devastated
the
surrounding
country
razed
the
city
walls
to
the
ground
and
demolished
and
burnt
the
remaining
houses
and
temples
he
then
returned
to
boeotia
the
plains
of
which
were
more
suited
to
the
movements
of
his
squadrons
and
took
up
a
position
in
an
entrenched
camp
on
the
right
bank
of
the
asopos
the
greek
army
under
the
command
of
pausanias
king
of
sparta
subsequently
followed
him
there
and
at
first
stationed
themselves
on
the
lower
slopes
of
mount
cithseron
their
force
was
composed
of
about
hoplites
and
about
as
many
more
light
troops
and
was
scarcely
inferior
in
numbers
to
the
enemy
but
it
had
no
cavalry
of
any
kind
several
days
passed
in
skirmishing
without
definite
results
mardonius
fearing
to
let
his
asiatic
troops
attack
the
heights
held
by
the
heavy
greek
infantry
and
pausanias
alarmed
lest
his
men
should
be
crushed
by
the
thessalian
and
persian
horse
if
he
ventured
down
into
the
plains
want
of
water
at
length
obliged
the
greeks
to
move
slightly
westwards
their
right
wing
descending
as
far
as
the
spring
of
gargaphia
and
their
left
to
the
bank
of
the
asopos
but
this
position
facing
east
exposed
them
so
seriously
to
the
attacks
of
the
light
asiatic
horse
that
after
enduring
it
for
ten
days
they
raised
their
camp
and
fell
back
in
the
night
on
platæa
unaccustomed
to
manouvre
together
they
were
unable
to
preserve
their
distances
when
day
dawned
their
lines
instead
of
presenting
a
continuous
front
were
distributed
into
three
unequal
bodies
occupying
various
parts
of
the
plain
mardonius
unhesitatingly
seized
his
opportunity
he
crossed
the
asopos
ordered
the
thebans
to
attack
the
athenians
and
with
the
bulk
of
his
asiatic
troops
charged
the
spartan
contingents
here
as
at
marathon
the
superiority
of
equipment
soon
gave
the
greeks
the
advantage
mardonius
was
killed
while
leading
the
charge
of
the
persian
guard
and
as
is
almost
always
the
case
among
orientals
his
death
decided
the
issue
of
the
battle
the
immortals
were
cut
to
pieces
round
his
dead
body
while
the
rest
took
flight
and
sought
refuge
in
their
camp

almost
simultaneously
the
athenians
succeeded
in
routing
the
boeotians
they
took
the
entrenchments
by
assault
gained
possession
of
an
immense
quantity
of
spoil
and
massacred
many
of
the
defenders
but
they
could
not
prevent
artabazus
from
retiring
in
perfect
order
with
of
his
best
troops
protected
by
his
cavalry
he
retired
successively
from
thessaly
macedonia
and
thrace
reached

after
suffering
severe
losses
and
european
greece
was
freed
for
ever
from

presence

the
barbarians

her
fate
was
being
decided
at
platsæ
that
of

greece
was
being
fought
out
on

coast

the
entreaties
of
the
samians
had
at
length
encouraged
leotychidas
and
xanthippus
to
take
the
initiative
the
persian
generals
who
were
not
expecting
this
aggressive
movement
had
distributed
the
greater
part
of
their
vessels
throughout
the
ionian
ports
and
had
merely
a
small
squadron
left
at
their
disposal
at
mycale
surprised
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
enemy
they
were
compelled
to
land
were
routed
and
their
vessels
burnt
this
constituted
the
signal
for
a
general
revolt
samos
chios
and
lesbos
affiliated
themselves
to
the
hellenic
confederation
and
the
cities
of
the
littoral
which
sparta
would
have
been
powerless
to
protect
for
want
of
a
fleet
concluded
an
alliance
with
athens
whose
naval
superiority
had
been
demonstrated
by
recent
events
the
towns
of
the
hellespont
threw
off
the
yoke
as
soon
as
the
triremes
of
the
confederates
appeared
within
their
waters
and
sestos
the
only
one
of
them
prevented
by
its
persian
garrison
from
yielding
to
the
athenians
succumbed
after
a
long
siege
during
the
winter
of
the
campaign
of
completed
the
deliverance
of
the
greeks
a
squadron
commanded
by
pausanias
roused
the
islands
of
the
carian
coast
and
cyprus
itself
without
encountering
any
opposition
and
then
steering
northwards
drove
the
persians
from
byzantium
the
following
winter
the
conduct
of
operations
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
sparta
into
those
of
athens
from
the
greatest
military
to
the
greatest
naval
power
in
greece
and
the
latter
on
assuming
command
at
once
took
steps
to
procure
the
means
which
would
enable
her
to
carry
out
her
task
thoroughly
she
brought
about
the
formation
of
a
permanent
league
between
the
asiatic
greeks
and
those
of
the
islands
each
city
joining
it
preserved
a
complete
autonomy
as
far
as
its
internal
affairs
were
concerned
but
pledged
itself
to
abide
by
the
advice
of
athens
in
everything
connected
with
the
war
against
the
persian
empire
and
contributed
a
certain
quota
of
vessels
men
and
money
calculated
according
to
its
resources
for
the
furtherance
of
the
national
cause
the
centre
of
the
confederation
was
fixed
at
delos
the
treasure
held
in
common
was
there
deposited
under
the
guardianship
of
the
god
and
the
delegates
from
the
confederate
states
met
there
every
year
at
the
solemn
festivals
athens
to
audit
the
accounts
of
her
administration
and
the
allies
to
discuss
the
interests
of
the
league
and
to
decide
on
the
measures
to
be
taken
against
the
common
enemy
oriental
empires
maintain
their
existence
only
on
condition
of
being
always
on
the
alert
and
always
victorious
they
can
neither
restrict
themselves
within
definite
limits
nor
remain
upon
the
defensive
for
from
the
day
when
they
desist
from
extending
their
area
their
ruin
becomes
inevitable
they
must
maintain
their
career
of
conquest
or
they
must
cease
to
exist
this
very
activity
which
saves
them
from
downfall
depends
like
the
control
of
affairs
entirely
on
the
ruling
sovereign
when
he
chances
to
be
too
indolent
or
too
incapable
of
government
he
retards
progress
by
his
inertness
or
misdirects
it
through
his
want
of
skill
and
the
fate
of
the
people
is
made
thus
to
depend
entirely
on
the
natural
disposition
of
the
prince
since
none
of
his
subjects
possesses
sufficient
authority
to
correct
the
mistakes
of
his
master
having
conquered
asia
the
persian
race
finding
itself
hemmed
in
by
insurmountable
obstacles
the
sea
the
african
and
arabian
deserts
the
mountains
of
turkestan
and
the
caucasus
and
the
steppes
of
siberia
had
only
two
outlets
for
its
energy
greece
and
india
darius
had
led
his
army
against
the
greeks
and
in
spite
of
the
resistance
he
had
encountered
from
them
he
had
gained
ground
and
was
on
the
point
of
striking
a
crucial
blow
when
death
cut
short
his
career
the
impetus
that
he
had
given
to
the
militant
policy
was
so
great
that
xerxes
was
at
first
carried
away
by
it
but
he
was
naturally
averse
to
war
without
individual
energy
and
destitute
of
military
genius
so
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
beaten
where
had
he
possessed
anything
of
the
instincts
of
a
commander
he
would
have
been
able
to
crush
his
adversary
with
the
sheer
weight
of
his
ships
and
battalions
even
after
salamis
even
after
platæa
and
mycale
the
resources
of
hellas
split
up
as
it
was
into
fifty
different
republics
could
hardly
bear
comparison
with
those
of
all
asia
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
one
man
xerxes
must
have
triumphed
in
the
end
had
he
persevered
in
his
undertaking
and
utilised
the
inexhaustible
amount
of
fresh
material
with
which
his
empire
could
have
furnished
him
but
to
do
that
he
would
have
had
to
take
a
serious
view
of
his
duties
as
a
sovereign
as
cyrus
and
darius
had
done
whereas
he
appears
to
have
made
use
of
his
power
merely
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
luxurious
tastes
and
his
capricious
affections
during
the
winter
following
his
return
and
while
he
was
reposing
at
sardes
after
the
fatigues
of
his
campaign
in
greece
he
fell
in
love
with
the
wife
of
masistes
one
of
his
brothers
and
as
she
refused
to
entertain
his
suit
he
endeavoured
to
win
her
by
marrying
his
son
darius
to
her
daughter
artayntas
he
was
still
amusing
himself
with
this
ignoble
intrigue
during
the
year
which
witnessed
the
disasters
of
platæa
and
mycale
when
he
was
vaguely
entertaining
the
idea
of
personally
conducting
a
fresh
army
beyond
the
ægean
but
the
marriage
of
his
son
having
taken
place
he
returned
to
susa
in
the
autumn
accompanied
by
the
entire
court
and
from
thenceforward
he
remained
shut
up
in
the
heart
of
his
empire
after
his
departure
the
war
lost
its
general
character
and
deteriorated
into
a
series
of
local
skirmishes
between
the
satraps
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
members
of
the
league
of
delos
the
phoenician
fleet
played
the
principal
part
in
the
naval
operations
but
the
central
and
eastern
asiatics
bactrians
indians
parthians
arians
arachosians
armenians
and
the
people
from
susa
and
babylon
scarcely
took
any
part
in
the
struggle
the
athenians
at
the
outset
assumed
the
offensive
under
the
intelligent
direction
of
cimon
they
expelled
the
persian
garrisons
from
eion
and
thrace
in
they
placed
successively
under
their
own
hegemony
all
the
greek
communities
of
the
asianic
littoral
towards
they
destroyed
a
fleet
anchored
within
the
gulf
of
pamphylia
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
eurymedon
and
as
at
mycale
they
landed
and
dispersed
the
force
destined
to
act
in
concert
with
the
squadron
sailing
from
thence
to
cyprus
they
destroyed
a
second
phoenician
fleet
of
eighty
vessels
and
returned
to
the
piraeus
laden
with
booty
such
exploits
were
not
devoid
of
glory
and
profit
for
the
time
being
but
they
had
no
permanent
results
all
these
naval
expeditions
were
indeed
successful
and
the
islands
and
towns
of
the
ægean
and
even
those
of
the
black
sea
and
the
southern
coasts
of
asia
minor
succeeded
without
difficulty
in
freeing
themselves
from
the
persian
yoke
under
the
protection
of
the
athenian
triremes
but
their
influence
did
not
penetrate
further
inland
than
a
few
miles
from
the
shore
beyond
which
distance
they
ran
the
risk
of
being
cut
off
from
their
vessels
and
the
barbarians
of
the
interior
lydians
phrygians
mysians
pamphylians
and
even
most
of
the
lycians
and
carians
remained
subject
to
the
rule
of
the
satraps
the
territory
thus
liberated
formed
but
a
narrow
border
along
the
coast
of
the
peninsula
a
border
rent
and
interrupted
at
intervals
constantly
in
peril
of
seizure
by
the
enemy
and
demanding
considerable
efforts
every
year
for
its
defence
athens
was
in
danger
of
exhausting
her
resources
in
the
performance
of
this
ungrateful
task
unless
she
could
succeed
in
fomenting
some
revolution
in
the
vast
possessions
of
her
adversary
which
should
endanger
the
existence
of
his
empire
or
which
at
any
rate
should
occupy
the
persian
soldiery
in
constantly
recurring
hostilities
against
the
rebellious
provinces
if
none
of
the
countries
in
the
centre
of
asia
minor
would
respond
to
their
call
and
if
the
interests
of
their
commercial
rivals
the
phoenicians
were
so
far
opposed
to
their
own
as
to
compel
them
to
maintain
the
conflict
to
the
very
end
egypt
at
any
rate
always
proud
of
her
past
glory
and
impatient
of
servitude
was
ever
seeking
to
rid
herself
of
the
foreign
yoke
and
recover
her
independent
existence
under
the
authority
of
her
pharaohs
it
was
not
easy
to
come
to
terms
with
her
and
give
her
efficient
help
from
athens
itself
but
cyprus
with
its
population
hostile
to
the
achæmenids
could
if
they
were
to
take
possession
of
it
form
an
admirable
base
of
operations
in
that
corner
of
the
mediterranean
the
athenians
were
aware
of
this
from
the
outset
and
after
their
victory
at
the
mouth
of
the
eurymedon
a
year
never
elapsed
without
their
despatching
a
more
or
less
numerous
fleet
into
cypriot
waters
by
so
doing
they
protected
the
ægean
from
the
piracy
of
the
phoenicians
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
event
of
any
movement
arising
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
they
were
close
enough
to
the
delta
to
be
promptly
informed
of
it
and
to
interfere
to
their
own
advantage
before
any
repressive
measures
could
be
taken
the
field
of
hostilities
having
shifted
and
greece
having
now
set
herself
to
attempt
the
dismemberment
of
the
persian
empire
we
may
well
ask
what
has
become
of
xerxes
the
little
energy
and
intelligence
he
had
possessed
at
the
outset
were
absorbed
by
a
life
of
luxury
and
debauchery
weary
of
his
hopeless
pursuit
of
the
wife
of
masistes
he
transferred
his
attentions
to
the
artayntas
whom
he
had
given
in
marriage
to
his
son
darius
and
succeeded
in
seducing
her
the
vanity
of
this
unfortunate
woman
at
length
excited
the
jealously
of
the
queen
amestris
believed
herself
threatened
by
the
ascendency
of
this
mistress
she
therefore
sent
for
the
mother
whom
she
believed
guilty
of
instigating
the
intrigue
and
having
cut
off
her
breasts
ears
nose
lips
and
torn
out
her
tongue
she
sent
her
back
thus
mutilated
to
her
family
masistes
wishing
to
avenge
her
set
out
for
bactriana
of
which
district
he
was
satrap
he
could
easily
have
incited
the
province
to
rebel
for
its
losses
in
troops
during
the
wars
in
europe
had
been
severe
and
a
secret
discontent
was
widespread
but
xerxes
warned
in
time
despatched
horsemen
in
pursuit
who
overtook
and
killed
him
the
incapacity
of
the
king
and
the
slackness
with
which
he
held
the
reins
of
were
soon
so
apparent
as
to
produce
intrigues
at
court
artabanus
the
chief
captain
of
the
guards
was
emboldened
by
the
state
of
affairs
to
attempt
to
substitute
his
own
rule
for
that
of
the
achæmenids
and
one
night
he
assassinated
xerxes
his
method
of
procedure
was
never
exactly
known
and
several
accounts
of
it
were
soon
afterwards
current
one
of
them
related
that
he
had
as
his
accomplice
the
eunuch
aspamithres
having
committed
the
crime
both
of
them
rushed
to
the
chamber
of
artaxerxes
one
of
the
sons
of
the
sovereign
but
still
a
child
they
accused
darius
the
heir
to
the
throne
of
the
murder
and
having
obtained
an
order
to
seize
him
they
dragged
him
before
his
brother
and
stabbed
him
while
he
loudly
protested
his
innocence
artaxerxes
is
the
form
commonly
adopted
by
the
greek
historians
and
by
the
moderns
who
follow
them
but
ctcsias
and
others
after
him
prefer
artoxerxes
the
original
form
of
the
persian
name
was
artakhshathra
illustration
artaxerxes
drawn
by
from
a
daric
in
the
des
other
tales
related
that
artabanus
had
taken
advantage
of
the
free
access
to
the
palace
which
his
position
allowed
him
to
conceal
himself
one
night
within
it
in
company
with
his
seven
sons
having
murdered
xerxes
he
convinced
artaxerxes
of
the
guilt
of
his
brother
and
conducting
him
to
the
chamber
where
he
was
found
asleep
artabanus
stabbed
him
on
the
spot
on
the
pretence
that
he
was
only
feigning
slumber
of
the
two
principal
accounts
the
first
is
as
old
as
ctesias
who
was
followed
in
general
outline
by
ephorus
of
whose
account
diodorus
siculus
preserves
a
summary
compilation
the
second
was
circulated
by
dinon
and
has
come
down
to
us
through
the
abbreviation
of
pompeius
trogus
the
remains
of
a
third
account
are
met
with
in
aristotle
ælian
knew
a
fourth
in
which
the
murder
was
ascribed
to
the
son
of
xerxes
himself
the
murderer
at
first
became
the
virtual
sovereign
and
he
exercised
his
authority
so
openly
that
later
chronographers
inserted
his
name
in
the
list
of
the
achæmenids
between
that
of
his
victim
and
his
but
at
the
end
of
six
months
when
he
was
planning
the
murder
of
the
young
prince
he
was
betrayed
by
megabyzos
and
slain
together
with
his
accomplices
his
sons
fearing
a
similar
fate
escaped
into
the
country
with
some
of
the
troops
they
perished
in
a
skirmish
sword
in
hand
but
their
prompt
defeat
though
it
helped
to
establish
the
new
king
upon
his
throne
did
not
ensure
peace
for
the
most
turbulent
provinces
at
the
two
extremes
of
the
empire
bactriana
on
the
northeast
and
egypt
in
the
at
once
rose
in
arms
the
bactrians
were
led
by
hystaspes
one
of
the
sons
of
xerxes
who
being
older
than
artaxerxes
claimed
the
throne
his
pretensions
were
not
supported
by
the
neighbouring
provinces
and
two
bloody
battles
soon
sealed
his
fate
the
chastisement
of
egypt
proved
a
harder
task
since
the
downfall
of
the
saites
the
eastern
nomes
of
the
delta
had
always
constituted
a
single
fief
which
the
greeks
called
the
kingdom
of
libya
lords
of
marea
and
of
the
fertile
districts
extending
between
the
canopic
arm
of
the
nile
the
mountains
and
the
sea
its
princes
probably
exercised
suzerainty
over
several
of
the
libyan
tribes
of
marmarica
inaros
son
of
psammetichus
who
was
then
the
ruling
sovereign
defied
the
persians
openly
the
inhabitants
of
the
delta
oppressed
by
the
of
achæmenes
welcomed
him
with
open
arms
and
he
took
possession
of
the
country
between
the
two
branches
of
the
nile
probably
aided
by
the
cyrenians
the
nile
valley
itself
and
memphis
closely
guarded
by
the
persian
garrisons
did
not
however
range
themselves
on
his
side
the
date
is
approximate
and
is
inferred
from
the
fact
that
the
war
in
bactriana
is
mentioned
in
ctesias
between
the
war
against
the
sons
of
artabanus
which
must
have
occupied
a
part
of
and
the
egyptian
rebellion
which
broke
out
about
as
diodorus
siculus
points
out
doubtless
following
ephorus
the
name
of
the
father
of
inaros
is
given
us
by
the
contemporary
testimony
of
thucydides
achomenes
is
the
form
given
by
herodotus
and
by
diodorus
siculus
who
make
him
the
son
of
darius
appointed
governor
of
egypt
after
the
repression
of
the
revolt
of
khabbîsha
ctesias
calls
him
achæmenides
and
says
that
he
was
the
son
of
xerxes
meanwhile
the
satrap
fearing
that
the
troops
at
his
disposal
were
insufficient
had
gone
to
beg
assistance
of
his
nephew
artaxerxes
had
assembled
an
army
and
a
fleet
and
in
the
first
moment
of
enthusiasm
had
intended
to
assume
the
command
in
person
but
by
the
advice
of
his
counsellors
he
was
with
little
difficulty
dissuaded
from
carrying
this
whim
into
effect
and
he
delegated
the
conduct
of
affairs
to
achæmenes
the
latter
at
first
repulsed
the
libyans
and
would
probably
have
soon
driven
them
back
into
their
deserts
had
not
the
athenians
interfered
in
the
fray
they
gave
orders
to
their
fleet
at
cyprus
to
support
the
insurgents
by
every
means
in
their
power
and
their
appearance
on
the
scene
about
the
autumn
of
changed
the
course
of
affairs
achæmenes
was
overcome
at
papremis
and
his
army
almost
completely
exterminated
inaros
struck
him
down
with
his
own
hand
in
the
struggle
but
the
same
evening
he
caused
the
body
to
be
recovered
and
sent
it
to
the
court
of
susa
though
whether
out
of
bravado
or
from
respect
to
the
achæmenian
race
it
is
impossible
to
say
diodorus
siculus
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
athenians
took
part
in
the
battle
of
papremis
thucydides
and
herodotus
do
not
speak
of
their
being
there
and
several
modern
historians
take
this
silence
as
a
proof
that
their
squadron
arrived
after
the
battle
had
been
fought
his
good
fortune
did
not
yet
forsake
him
some
days
afterwards
the
athenian
squadron
of
charitimides
came
up
by
chance
with
the
phoenician
fleet
which
was
sailing
to
the
help
of
the
persians
and
had
not
yet
received
the
news
of
the
disaster
which
had
befallen
them
at
papremis
the
greeks
sunk
thirty
of
the
vessels
and
took
twenty
more
and
after
this
success
the
allies
believed
that
they
had
merely
to
show
themselves
to
bring
about
a
general
rising
of
the
fellahîn
and
effect
the
expulsion
of
the
persians
from
the
whole
of
egypt
they
sailed
up
the
river
and
forced
memphis
after
a
few
siege
but
the
garrison
of
the
white
wall
refused
to
surrender
and
the
allies
were
obliged
to
lay
siege
to
it
in
the
ordinary
manner
in
the
issue
this
proved
their
ruin
artaxerxes
raised
a
fresh
force
in
cilicia
and
while
completing
his
preparations
attempted
to
bring
about
a
diversion
in
greece
the
strength
of
pharaoh
did
not
so
much
depend
on
his
libyan
and
egyptian
hordes
as
on
the
little
body
of
hoplites
and
the
crews
of
the
athenian
squadron
and
if
the
withdrawal
of
the
latter
could
be
effected
the
repulse
of
the
others
would
be
a
certainty
persian
agents
were
therefore
employed
to
beg
the
spartans
to
invade
attica
but
the
remembrance
of
salamis
and
platæa
was
as
yet
too
fresh
to
permit
of
the
lacedæmonians
allying
themselves
with
the
common
enemy
and
their
virtue
on
this
occasion
was
proof
against
the
darics
of
the
orientals
the
egyptian
army
was
placed
in
the
field
early
in
the
year
under
the
leadership
of
megabyzos
the
satrap
of
syria
it
numbered
so
it
was
said
some
men
and
it
was
supported
by
phoenician
vessels
commanded
by
artabazos
the
date
of
for
the
arrival
of
the
athenians
is
concluded
from
the
passage
of
thucydides
who
gives
an
account
of
the
end
of
the
war
after
the
cruise
of
tolmides
in
in
the
sixth
year
of
its
course
megabyzos
opened
these
negotiations
and
his
presence
at
sparta
during
the
winter
of
is
noticed
ctesias
here
introduces
the
persian
admiral
horiscos
but
diodorus
places
artabazos
and
megabyzos
side
by
side
as
was
the
case
later
on
in
the
war
in
cyprus
one
at
the
head
of
the
fleet
the
other
of
the
army
it
is
probable
that
the
historian
from
whom
diodorus
copied
viz
ephorus
recognised
the
same
division
of
leadership
in
the
egyptian
campaign
the
allies
raised
the
blockade
of
the
white
wall
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
delta
and
hastened
to
attack
him
but
they
had
lost
their
opportunity
defeated
in
a
desperate
encounter
in
which
charitimides
was
killed
and
inaros
wounded
in
the
thigh
they
barricaded
themselves
within
the
large
island
of
prosopitis
about
the
first
fortnight
in
january
of
the
year
and
there
sustained
a
regular
siege
for
the
space
of
eighteen
months
at
the
end
of
that
time
megabyzos
succeeded
in
turning
an
arm
of
the
river
which
left
their
fleet
high
and
dry
and
rather
than
allow
it
to
fall
into
his
hands
they
burned
their
vessels
whereupon
he
gave
orders
to
make
the
final
assault
the
bulk
of
the
athenian
auxiliaries
perished
in
that
attack
the
remainder
withdrew
with
inaros
into
the
fortified
town
of
byblos
where
megabyzos
unwilling
to
prolong
a
struggle
with
a
desperate
enemy
permitted
them
to
capitulate
on
honourable
terms
some
of
them
escaped
and
returned
to
cyrene
from
whence
they
took
ship
to
their
own
country
but
the
main
body
to
the
number
of
were
carried
away
to
susa
by
megabyzos
in
order
to
receive
the
confirmation
of
the
treaty
which
he
had
concluded
as
a
crowning
stroke
of
misfortune
a
reinforcement
of
fifty
athenian
triremes
which
at
this
juncture
entered
the
mendesian
mouth
of
the
nile
was
surrounded
by
the
phoenician
fleet
and
more
than
half
of
them
destroyed
the
fall
of
prosopitis
brought
the
rebellion
to
an
end
the
accounts
of
these
events
given
by
ctesias
and
thucydides
are
complementary
and
in
spite
of
their
brevity
together
form
a
whole
which
must
be
sufficiently
near
the
truth
that
of
ephorus
preserved
in
diodorus
is
derived
from
an
author
who
shows
partiality
to
the
athenians
and
who
passes
by
everything
not
to
their
honour
while
he
seeks
to
throw
the
blame
for
the
final
disaster
on
the
cowardice
of
the
egyptians
the
summary
of
aristodemus
comes
directly
from
that
of
thucydides
the
nomes
of
the
delta
were
restored
to
order
and
as
was
often
customary
in
oriental
kingdoms
the
vanquished
petty
princes
or
their
children
were
reinvested
in
their
hereditary
fiefs
even
libya
was
not
taken
from
the
family
of
inaros
but
was
given
to
his
son
thannyras
and
a
certain
psammetichus
a
few
bands
of
fugitives
however
took
refuge
in
the
marshes
of
the
littoral
in
the
place
where
the
saites
in
former
times
had
sought
a
safe
retreat
and
they
there
proclaimed
king
a
certain
amyrtgeus
who
was
possibly
connected
with
the
line
of
amasis
and
successfully
defied
the
repeated
attempts
of
the
persians
to
dislodge
them
the
greek
league
had
risked
the
best
of
its
forces
in
this
rash
undertaking
and
had
failed
in
its
enterprise
it
had
cost
the
allies
so
dearly
in
men
and
galleys
that
if
the
persians
had
at
once
assumed
the
offensive
most
of
the
asiatic
cities
would
have
found
themselves
in
a
most
critical
situation
and
athens
then
launched
in
a
quarrel
with
the
states
of
the
peloponnesus
would
have
experienced
the
greatest
difficulty
in
succouring
them
the
feebleness
of
artaxerxes
however
and
possibly
the
intrigues
at
court
and
troubles
in
various
other
parts
of
the
empire
prevented
the
satraps
from
pursuing
their
advantage
and
when
at
length
they
meditated
taking
action
the
opportunity
had
gone
by
they
nevertheless
attempted
to
regain
the
ascendency
over
cyprus
artabazos
with
a
sidonian
fleet
cruised
about
the
island
megabyzos
assembled
troops
in
cilicia
and
the
petty
kings
of
greek
origin
raised
a
cry
of
alarm
athens
which
had
just
concluded
a
truce
with
the
peloponnesians
at
once
sent
two
hundred
vessels
to
their
assistance
under
the
command
of
oimon
cimon
acted
as
though
he
were
about
to
reopen
the
campaign
in
egypt
and
despatched
sixty
of
his
triremes
to
king
amyrtceus
while
he
himself
took
marion
and
blockaded
kition
with
the
rest
of
his
forces
the
siege
dragged
on
he
was
perhaps
about
to
abandon
it
when
he
took
to
his
bed
and
died
those
who
succeeded
him
in
the
command
were
obliged
to
raise
the
blockade
for
want
of
provisions
but
as
they
returned
and
were
passing
salamis
they
fell
in
with
the
phoenician
vessels
which
had
just
been
landing
the
cilician
troops
and
defeated
them
they
then
disembarked
and
as
at
mycale
and
eurymedon
they
gained
a
second
victory
in
the
open
field
after
which
they
joined
the
squadron
which
had
been
sent
to
egypt
and
sailed
for
athens
with
the
dead
body
of
their
chief
they
had
once
more
averted
the
danger
of
an
attack
on
the
ægean
but
that
was
all
the
athenian
statesmen
had
for
some
time
past
realised
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
sustain
a
double
conflict
and
fight
the
battles
of
greece
against
the
common
enemy
while
half
of
the
cities
whose
safety
was
secured
by
their
heroic
devotion
were
harassing
them
on
the
continent
but
the
influence
of
cimon
had
up
till
now
encouraged
them
to
persist
on
the
death
of
cimon
they
gave
up
the
attempt
and
callias
one
of
their
leaders
repaired
in
state
to
susa
for
the
purpose
of
opening
negotiations
the
peace
which
was
concluded
on
the
occasion
of
this
embassy
might
at
first
sight
appear
advantageous
to
their
side
the
persian
king
without
actually
admitting
his
reverses
accepted
their
immediate
consequences
he
recognised
the
independence
of
the
asiatic
creeks
of
those
at
least
who
belonged
to
the
league
of
delos
and
he
promised
that
his
armies
on
land
should
never
advance
further
than
three
march
from
the
ægean
littoral
on
the
seas
he
forbade
his
squadrons
to
enter
hellenic
waters
from
the
chelidonian
to
the
cyanæan
rocks
that
is
from
the
eastern
point
of
lycia
to
the
opening
of
the
black
sea
this
prohibition
did
not
apply
to
the
merchant
vessels
of
the
contracting
parties
and
they
received
permission
to
traffic
freely
in
each
waters
the
phoenicians
in
greece
and
the
greeks
in
phonicia
cilicia
and
egypt
and
yet
when
we
consider
the
matter
athens
and
hellas
were
of
the
two
the
greater
losers
by
this
convention
which
appeared
to
imply
their
superiority
not
only
did
they
acknowledge
indirectly
that
they
felt
themselves
unequal
to
the
task
of
overthrowing
the
empire
but
they
laid
down
their
arms
before
they
had
accomplished
the
comparatively
restricted
task
which
they
had
set
themselves
to
perform
that
of
freeing
all
the
greeks
from
the
iranian
yoke
their
egyptian
compatriots
still
remained
persian
tributaries
in
company
with
the
cities
of
cyrenaïca
pamphylia
and
cilicia
and
above
all
that
island
of
cyprus
in
which
they
had
gained
some
of
their
most
signal
triumphs
the
persians
relieved
from
a
war
which
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
had
consumed
their
battalions
and
squadrons
drained
their
finances
and
excited
their
subjects
to
revolt
were
now
free
to
regain
their
former
wealth
and
perhaps
their
vigour
could
they
only
find
generals
to
command
their
troops
and
guide
their
politics
artaxerxes
was
incapable
of
directing
this
revival
and
his
inveterate
weakness
exposed
him
perpetually
to
the
plotting
of
his
satraps
or
to
the
intrigues
of
the
women
of
his
harem
the
example
of
artabanus
followed
by
that
of
hystaspes
had
shown
how
easy
it
was
for
an
ambitious
man
to
get
rid
secretly
of
a
monarch
or
a
prince
and
seriously
endanger
the
crown
the
members
of
the
families
who
had
placed
darius
on
the
throne
possessed
by
hereditary
right
or
something
little
short
of
it
the
wealthiest
and
most
populous
provinces
babylonia
syria
lydia
phrygia
and
the
countries
of
the
halys
and
they
were
practically
kings
in
all
but
name
in
spite
of
the
which
the
general
and
the
secretary
were
supposed
to
exercise
over
their
actions
besides
this
the
indifference
and
incapacity
of
the
ruling
sovereigns
had
already
tended
to
destroy
the
order
of
the
administrative
system
so
ably
devised
by
darius
the
satrap
had
as
a
rule
absorbed
the
functions
of
a
general
within
his
own
province
and
the
secretary
was
too
insignificant
a
personage
to
retain
authority
and
independence
unless

himself

went
to

lengths
if
he
could
thereby
avoid

revolt
when
this
was
inevitable
and
the
rebels
were
vanquished
he
still
continued
to
conciliate
them
and
in
most
cases
their
fiefs
and
rights
were
preserved

restored

by
his
turbulence
was
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
artaxerxes
during
the
half
of
his
reign
he
had
ended
his
campaign
in
egypt
by
engaging
to
preserve
the
lives
of
inaros
and
the
greeks
who
had
capitulated
at
byblos
and
in
spite
of
the
anger
of
the
king
he
succeeded
in
keeping
his
word
for
five
years
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
demands
of
amestris
prevailed
she
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
him
some
fifty
greeks
whom
she
beheaded
besides
inaros
himself
whom
she
impaled
to
avenge
achæmenes
megabyzos
who
had
not
recovered
from
the
losses
he
had
sustained
in
his
last
campaign
against
cimon
at
first
concealed
his
anger
but
he
asked
permission
to
visit
his
syrian
province
and
no
sooner
did
he
reach
it
than
he
resorted
to
hostilities
he
defeated
in
succession
usiris
and
menostates
the
two
generals
despatched
against
him
and
when
force
failed
to
overcome
his
obstinate
resistance
the
government
condescended
to
treat
with
him
and
swore
to
forget
the
past
if
he
would
consent
to
lay
down
arms
to
this
he
agreed
and
reappeared
at
court
but
once
there
his
confidence
nearly
proved
fatal
to
him
having
been
invited
to
take
part
in
a
hunt
he
pierced
with
his
javelin
a
lion
which
threatened
to
attack
the
king
artaxerxes
called
to
mind
an
ancient
law
which
punished
by
death
any
intervention
of
that
kind
and
he
ordered
that
the
culprit
should
be
beheaded
megabyzos
with
difficulty
escaped
this
punishment
through
the
entreaties
of
amestris
and
of
his
wife
amytis
but
he
was
deprived
of
his
fiefs
and
sent
to
kyrta
on
the
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
after
five
years
this
exile
became
unbearable
he
therefore
spread
the
report
that
he
was
attacked
by
leprosy
and
he
returned
home
without
any
one
venturing
to
hinder
him
from
fear
of
defiling
themselves
by
contact
with
his
person
amestris
and
amytis
brought
about
his
reconciliation
with
his
sovereign
and
thenceforward
he
regulated
his
conduct
so
successfully
that
the
past
was
completely
forgotten
and
when
he
died
at
the
age
of
years
artaxerxes
deeply
regretted
his
loss
these
events
are
known
to
us
only
through
ctesias
their
date
is
uncertain
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
occurred
after
campaign
in
cyprus
and
the
conclusion
of
the
peace
of
callias
peace
having
been
signed
with
athens
and
the
revolt
of
megabyzos
being
at
an
end
artaxerxes
was
free
to
enjoy
himself
without
further
care
for
the
future
and
to
pass
his
time
between
his
various
capitals
and
palaces

their
predecessors
had
expired

its
lonely
position

simple
appointments
no
longer
suited
their
luxurious
and
effeminate
habits

had
in
consequence
fixed
his
residence

the
south

it

the
village

after
its
development
became

there
erected
buildings
more

found
the
place
so
much
to
his
taste
during

lifetime
that
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
it

trouble
disturbed
his
repose
after

but
on
his
death
in
there
was
a
renewal
of
the
intrigues
and
ambitious
passions
which
had
stained
with
bloodshed
the
opening
years
of
his
reign
the
legitimate
heir
xerxes
was
assassinated
after
a
reign
of
days
by
secudianus
sogdianus
one
of
his
illegitimate
brothers
and
the
which
was
escorting
the
bodies
of
his
parents
conveyed
his
also
to
the
royal
at
persepolis
meanwhile
secudianus
became
suspicious
of
another
of
his
brothers
named
ochus
whom
artaxerxes
had
caused
to
marry
parysatis
one
of
the
daughters
of
xerxes
and
whom
he
had
set
over
the
important
province
of
hyrcania
ochus
received
repeated
summonses
to
appear
in
his
presence
to
pay
him
homage
and
at
last
obeyed
the
mandate
but
arrived
at
the
head
of
an
army
the
persian
nobility
rose
at
his
approach
and
one
by
one
the
chief
persons
of
the
state
declared
themselves
in
his
favour
first
arbarius
commander
of
the
cavalry
then
arxanes
the
satrap
of
egypt
and
lastly
the
eunuch
artoxares
the
ruler
of
armenia
these
three
all
combined
in
urging
ochus
to
assume
the
publicly
which
he
with
feigned
reluctance
consented
to
do
and
proceeded
at
the
suggestion
of
parysatis
to
open
negotiations
with
secudianus
offering
to
divide
the
regal
power
with
him
secudianus
accepted
the
offer
against
the
advice
of
his
minister
menostanes
and
gave
himself
up
into
the
hands
of
the
rebels
he
was
immediately
seized
and
cast
into
the
ashes
where
he
perished
miserably
after
a
reign
of
six
months
and
fifteen
days
on
ascending
the
throne

assumed
the
name
of
darius

confidential
advisers
were
three
eunuchs
who
ruled
the
empire

who
had
taken
such
a
prominent
part
in
the
campaign
which
won
him
the
crown
artibarzanes
and
athôos
but
the
guiding
spirit
of
his
government
was
in
reality
his
wife
the
detestable
parysatis
she
had
already
borne
him
two
children
before
she
became
queen
a
daughter
amestris
and
a
son
arsaces
who
afterwards
became
king
under
the
name
of
artaxerxes
soon
after
the
accession
of
her
husband
she
bore
him
a
second
son
whom
she
named
cyrus
in
memory
of
the
founder
of
the
empire
and
a
daughter
artostê

other

at
no

herself
of

thwarted
her
schemes
even
though
they
might
be

of
her

not

with
putting
them
out

the
way
she
delighted
in
making
them
taste
her
hatred
to
the
full
by
subjecting
them
to
the
most
skilfully
graduated
refinements
of
torture
she
deservedly
left
behind
her
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
most
cruel
of
all
the
cruel
queens
whose
memory
was
a
terror
not
only
to
the
harems
of
persia
but
to
the
whole
of
the
eastern
world

numerous
revolts
which
broke
out
soon
after
her
accession
furnished
occasions
for
the
revelation
of
her
perfidious
cleverness
all
the
malcontents
of
the
reign
of
artaxerxes
those
who
had
been
implicated
in
the
murder
of

who
had
sided
with

had
rallied
round
a
younger

one
of
them
artyphios

of

took
the

mercenaries
he
won
two
successive
victories
at
the

of

was
subsequently
defeated
though
his
forces
still
remained
formidable
but

accomplished
what
persian
bravery
had
failed
to
achieve
and
prevailed
over
the

so
successfully
that

deserted

in

as
soon
as
he
had
set
up

court
at

he
planned
how

to
conciliate
their

at

to
win
over
those
whose

its

the

day
of

of

for

as
for

his
intimacy
with

his
constant
enlistments
of
mercenary
troops
and
his
secret
dealings
with
the
neighbouring
provinces
had
already
aroused
suspicion
and

to

darius

endowed

requisite
to

and
he
had
moreover
learnt
through

with
the

to
recognise
the
weak
points
of
his

was
fully
determined

remedy
them

perhaps
was
an
irreparable
misfortune

that

at

temporarily
have
arrested
its
decline
having
lost
their

his

the

gained
at

the
shores
of
the

up
to

and
hold
in
check
by

but
which
they
could
not
without
imprudence
venture
to
attack
within

the
experience
of

was
a
proof
to
them
that
a
handful

men
deprived
of
their

successfully

the

at

great

and
sparta
recalled
by
these
reverses
to
a
realisation
of
her
position
wisely
abandoned
her
inclination
for
distant
enterprises
asia
minor
was
reconquered
and
persia
passed
from
the
position
of
a
national
enemy
to
that
of
the
friend
and
arbiter
of
greece
but
she
did
so
by
force
of
circumstances
only
and
not
from
having
merited
in
any
way
the
supremacy
she
attained
her
military
energy
indeed
was
far
from
being
exhausted
but
poor
artaxerxes
bewildered
by
the
rivalries
between
his
mother
and
his
wives
did
not
know
how
to
make
the
most
of
the
immense
resources
still
at
his
disposal
and
he
met
with
repeated
checks
as
soon
as
he
came
face
to
face
with
a
nation
and
leaders
who
refused
to
stoop
to
treachery
he
had
no
sooner
recovered
possession
of
the
ægean
littoral
than
egypt
was
snatched
from
his
grasp
by
a
new
pharaoh
who
had
arisen
in
the
nile
valley
the
peace
had
not
been
seriously
disturbed
in
egypt
during
the
forty
years
which
had
elapsed
since
the
defeat
of
inarus
satrap
had
peaceably
succeeded
satrap
in
the
fortress
of
memphis
the
exhaustion
of
libya
had
any
movement
on
the
part
of
thannyras
the
aged
amyrtæus
had
passed
from
the
scene
and
his
son
pausiris
bent
his
neck
submissively
to
the
persian
yoke
more
than
once
however
unexpected
outbursts
had
shown
that
the
fires
of
rebellion
were
still
smouldering
a
psammetichus
who
reigned
about
in
a
corner
of
the
delta
had
dared
to
send
corn
and
presents
to
the
athenians
then
at
war
with
artaxerxes
and
the
second
year
of
darius
ii
had
been
troubled
by
a
sanguinary
sedition
which
however
was
easily
suppressed
by
the
governor
then
in
power
finally
about
a
king
of
egypt
had
not
without
some
show
of
evidence
laid
himself
open
to
the
charge
of
sending
a
piratical
expedition
into
phoenician
waters
an
arab
king
having
contributed
to
the
enterprise
the
revolt
mentioned
by
ctesias
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
insurrection
of
the
satrap
of
egypt
which
is
here
referred
to
the
date
of
which
is
furnished
by
the
syncellus
it
was
easy
to
see
moreover
from
periodical
revolts
such
as
that
of
megabyzos
in
syria
those
of
artyphios
and
arsites
of
pissuthnes
and
amorges
in
asia
minor
with
what
impunity
the
wrath
of
the
great
king
could
be
defied
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
therefore
that
about
an
enemy
should
appear
in
the
heart
of
the
delta
in
the
person
of
a
grandson
and
namesake
of
amyrtæus
he
did
not
at
first
rouse
the
whole
country
to
revolt
for
egyptian
troops
were
still
numbered
in
the
army
of
artaxerxes
at
the
battle
of
cunaxa
in
but
he
succeeded
in
establishing
a
regular
native
government
and
struggled
so
resolutely
against
the
foreign
domination
that
the
historians
of
the
sacred
colleges
inscribed
his
name
on
the
list
of
the
pharaohs
he
is
there
made
to
represent
a
whole
dynasty
the
xxviiith
which
lasted
six
years
coincident
with
the
six
years
of
his
reign
it
was
due
to
a
mendesian
dynasty
however
whose
founder
was
nephorites
that
egypt
obtained
its
entire
freedom
and
was
raised
once
more
to
the
rank
of
a
nation
this
dynasty
from
the
very
outset
adopted
the
policy
which
had
proved
so
successful
in
the
case
of
the
saites
three
centuries
previously
and
employed
it
with
similar
success
egypt
had
always
been
in
the
position
of
a
besieged
fortress
which
needed
for
its
complete
security
that
its
first
lines
of
defence
should
be
well
in
advance
of
its
citadel
she
must
either
possess
syria
or
win
her
as
an
ally
if
she
desired
to
be
protected
against
all
chance
of
sudden
invasion
nephorites
and
his
successors
therefore
formed
alliances
beyond
the
isthmus
and
even
on
the
other
side
of
the
mediterranean
with
cyprus
caria
and
greece
in
one
case
to
purchase
support
and
in
another
to
the
ancient
supremacy
exercised
by
the
theban
pharaohs
this
is
at
any
rate
the
idea
given
of
him
by
egyptian
tradition
in
the
time
of
the
ptolemies
as
results
from
a
passage
in
the
where
his
reign
is
mentioned
every
revolt
against
the
persians
every
quarrel
among
the
satraps
helped
forward
their
cause
since
they
compelled
the
great
king
to
suspend
his
attacks
against
egypt
altogether
or
to
prosecute
them
at
wide
intervals
the
egyptians
therefore
fomented
such
quarrels
or
even
at
need
provoked
them
and
played
their
game
so
well
that
for
a
long
time
they
had
to
oppose
only
a
fraction
of
the
persian
forces
like
the
saite
pharaohs
before
them
they
were
aware
how
little
reliance
could
be
placed
on
native
troops
and
they
recruited
their
armies
at
great
expense
from
the
european
greeks
this
occurred
at
the
time
when
mercenary
forces
were
taking
the
place
of
native
levies
throughout
hellas
and
war
was
developing
into
a
lucrative
trade
for
those
who
understood
how
to
conduct
it
adventurers
greedy
for
booty
flocked
to
the
standards
of
the
generals
who
enjoyed
the
best
reputation
for
kindness
or
ability
and
the
generals
themselves
sold
their
services
to
the
highest
bidder
the
persian
kings
took
large
advantage
of
this
arrangement
to
procure
troops
the
pharaohs
imitated
their
example
and
in
the
years
which
followed
the
most
experienced
captains
iphicrates
chabrias
and
timotheus
passed
from
one
camp
to
another
as
often
against
the
will
as
with
the
consent
of
their
fatherland
the
power
of
sparta
was
at
her
zenith
when
nephorites
ascended
the
throne
and
she
was
just
preparing
for
her
expedition
to
phrygia
the
pharaoh
concluded
an
alliance
with
the
lacedomonians
and
in
sent
to
agesilaus
a
fleet
laden
with
arms
corn
and
supplies
which
however
was
intercepted
by
conon
who
was
at
that
moment
cruising
in
the
direction
of
rhodes
in
command
of
the
persian
squadron
this
misadventure
and
the
abrupt
retreat
of
the
spartans
from
asia
minor
cooled
the
good
will
of
the
egyptian
king
towards
his
allies
thinking
that
they
had
abandoned
him
and
that
he
was
threatened
with
an
imminent
attack
on
the
shore
of
the
delta
he
assembled
probably
at
pelusium
the
forces
he
had
apparently
intended
for
a
distant
enterprise
matters
took
longer
to
come
to
a
crisis
than
he
had
expected
the
retreat
of
agesilaus
had
not
pacified
the
ægean
satrapies
after
the
disturbance
created
by
cyrus
the
younger
the
greater
number
of
the
native
tribes
mysians
pisidians
people
of
pontus
and
paphlagonia
had
shaken
off
the
persian
yoke
and
it
was
a
matter
of
no
small
difficulty
to
reduce
them
once
more
to
subjection
their
incessant
turbulence
gave
egypt
time
to
breathe
and
to
organise
new
combinations
cyprus
entered
readily
into
her
designs
since
the
subjugation
of
that
island
in
the
greek
cities
had
suffered
terrible
oppression
at
the
hands
of
the
great
king
artaxerxes
despairing
of
reducing
them
to
obedience
depended
exclusively
for
support
on
the
phoenician
inhabitants
of
the
island
who
through
his
favour
regained
so
much
vigour
that
in
the
space
of
less
than
two
generations
they
had
recovered
most
of
the
ground
lost
during
the
preceding
centuries
semitic
rulers
replaced
the
achaean
tyrants
at
salamis
and
in
most
of
the
other
cities
and
citium
became
what
it
had
been
before
the
rise
of
salamis

principal
commercial
centre
in
the
island
evagoras
a
descendant
of
the
ancient
kings
endeavoured
to
retrieve
the
grecian
cause
after
driving
out
of
salamis
abdemon
its
tyrian
ruler
he
took
possession
of
all
the
other
towns
except
citium
and
amathus
this
is
not
the
place
to
recount
the
brilliant
part
played
by
evagoras
in
conjunction
with
conon
during
the
campaigns
against
the
spartans
in
the
peloponnesian
war
the
activity
he
then
displayed
and
the
ambitious
designs
he
revealed
soon
drew
upon
him
the
dislike
of
the
persian
governors
and
their
sovereign
and
from
he
was
at
open
war
with
persia
he
would
have
been
unable
to
maintain
the
struggle
for
any
length
of
time
but
egypt
and
greece
were
at
his
back
ready
to
support
him
with
money
or
arms
hakoris
had
succeeded
nephorites
in
and
had
repulsed
an
attack
of
artaxerxes
between
and
the
length
of
the
reign
of
nephorites
is
fixed
at
six
years
by

lists
of
manetho
the
date
of
his
reign
is
that
of
his
fourth
year
on
a
preserved
in
the
louvre
this
war
is
alluded
to
by
several
ancient
authors
in
passages
which
have
been
brought
together
and
explained
by
judeah
but
unfortunately
the
detailed
history
of
the
events
is
not
known
he
was
not
unduly
exalted
by
his
success
and
had
immediately
taken
wise
precautions
in
view
of
a
second
invasion
after
safeguarding
his
western
frontier
by
concluding
a
treaty
with
the
libyans
of
barca
he
entered
into
an
alliance
with
evagoras
and
the
athenians
illustration
hakoris

he
sent
lavish
gifts
of
corn
to
the
cypriots
as
well
as
munitions
of
war
ships
and
money
while
athens
sent
them
several
thousand
men
under
the
command
of
chabrias
not
only
did
an
expedition
despatched
against
them
under

evagoras
seized

the

were
already
preparing
for
revolt
and
one
of
them
hecatomnus
of

had
openly
joined
the
allies

suddenly
opened
negotiations
with

antalcidas
presented
himself
at
susa
to
pay
homage
before
the
throne
of
the
great
king
the
treaty
of

had
brought
the
efforts
of
athens
to
naught
and
sold
the
asiatic
greeks
to
their
oppressors
the
peace
obtained
by
antalcidas
effaced
the
results
of
salamis
and
platsæ
and
laid
european
greece
prostrate
at
the
feet
of
her
previously
vanquished
foes
an
order
issuing
from
the
centre
of
persia
commanded
the
cities
of
greece
to
suspend
hostilities
and
respect
each
liberties
the
issuing
of
such
an
order
was
equivalent
to
treating
them
as
vassals
whose
quarrels
it
is
the
function
of
the
suzerain
to
repress
but
they
nevertheless
complied
with
the
command
artaxerxes
relieved
from
anxiety
for
the
moment
as
to
affairs
on
the
ægean
was
now
free
to
send
his
best
generals
into
the
rebel
countries
and
such
was
the
course
his
ministers
recommended
evagoras
was
naturally
the
first
to
be
attacked
cyprus
was
in
fact
an
outpost
of
egypt
commanding
as
she
did
the
approach
by
sea
she
was
in
a
position
to
cut
the
communications
of
any
army
which
issuing
from
palestine
should
march
upon
the
delta
artaxerxes
assembled
three
hundred
thousand
and
three
hundred
triremes
under
the
command
of
tiribazus
and
directed
the
whole
force
against
the
island
at
first
the
cypriot
cruisers
intercepted
the
convoys
which
were
bringing
provisions
for
this
large
force
and
by
so
doing
reduced
the
invaders
to
such
straits
that
sedition
broke
out
in
their
camp
but
evagoras
was
defeated
at
sea
off
the
promontory
of
citium
and
his
squadron
destroyed
he
was
not
in
any
way
discouraged
by
this
misfortune
but
leaving
his
son
pnytagoras
to
hold
the
barbarian
forces
in
check
he
hastened
to
implore
the
help
of
the
pharaoh
but
hakoris
was
too
much
occupied
with
securing
his
own
immediate
safety
to
risk
anything
in
so
desperate
an
enterprise
evagoras
was
able
to
bring
back
merely
an
insufficient
subsidy
he
shut
himself
up
in
salamis
and
there
maintained
the
conflict
for
some
years
longer
meanwhile
hakoris
realising
that
the
submission
of
cyprus
would
oppose
his
flank
to
attack
tried
to
effect
a
diversion
in
asia
minor
and
by
entering
into
alliance
with
the
pisidians
then
in
open
insurrection
he
procured
for
it
a
respite
of
which
he
himself
took
advantage
to
prepare
for
the
decisive
struggle
the
peace
effected
by
antalcidas
had
left
most
of
the
mercenary
soldiers
of
greece
without
employment
hakoris
hired
twenty
thousand
of
them
and
the
phoenician
admirals
still
occupied
in
blockading
the
ports
of
cyprus
failed
to
intercept
the
vessels
which
brought
him
these
reinforcements
it
was
fortunate
for
egypt
that
they
did
so
for
the
pharaoh
died
in
and
his
successors
psamuthis
il
mutis
and
nephorites
il
each
occupied
the
throne
for
a
very
short
time
and
the
whole
country
was
in
confusion
for
rather
more
than
two
years
during
the
settlement
of
the
succession
hakoris
reigned
thirteen
years
from
to
the
reigns
of
the
three
succeeding
kings
occupied
only
two
years
and
four
months
between
them
from
the
end
of
to
the
beginning
of
muthes
or
mutis
who
is
not
mentioned
in
all
the
lists
of
manetho
seems
to
have
his
counterpart
in

inverted
the
order
usually
adopted
and
proposed
the
following
series
nephorites
muthes
psamuthis
hakoris
nephorites
ii
the
discovery
at
karnak
of
a
small
temple
where
psamuthis
mentions
hakoris
as
his
predecessor
shows
that
on
this
point
at
least
manetho
was
well
informed
the
turbulent
disposition
of
the
great
feudatory
nobles
which
had
so
frequently
brought
trouble
upon
previous
pharaohs
during
the
assyrian
wars
was
no
less
dangerous
in
this
last
century
of
egyptian
independence
it
caused
the
fall
of
the
mendesian
dynasty
in
the
very
face
of
the
enemy
and
the
prince
of
sebennytos
nectanebo
was
raised
to
the
throne
by
the
military
faction
according
to
a
tradition
current
in
ptolemaic
times
this
sovereign
was
a
son
of
nephorites
who
had
been
kept
out
of
his
heritage
by
the
jealousy
of
the
gods
whatever
his
origin
the
people
had
no
cause
to
repent
of
having
accepted
him
as
their
king
he
began
his
reign
by
suppressing
the
slender
subsidies
which
evagoras
had
continued
to
receive
from
his
predecessors
and
this
measure
if
not
generous
was
at
least
politic
for
cyprus
was
now
virtually
in
the
power
of
the
persians
and
the
blockade
of
a
few
thousand
men
in
salamis
did
not
draught
away
a
sufficiently
large
proportion
of
their
effective
force
to
be
of
any
service
to
egypt
the
money
which
had
hitherto
been
devoted
to
the
cypriots
was
henceforth
reserved
for
the
direct
defence
of
the
nile
valley
evagoras
obtained
unexpectedly
favourable
conditions
artaxerxes
conceded
to
him
his
title
of
king
and
the
possession
of
his
city
and
turned
his
whole
attention
to
nectanebo
the
last
of
his
enemies
who
still
held
out
nectanebo
had
spared
no
pains
in
preparing
effectively
to
receive
his
foe
he
chose
as
his
coadjutor
the
athenian
chabrias
whose
capacity
as
a
general
had
been
manifested
by
recent
events
and
the
latter
accepted
this
office
although
he
had
received
no
instructions
from
his
government
to
do
so
and
had
transformed
the
delta
into
an
entrenched
camp
he
had
fortified
the
most
vulnerable
points
along
the
coast
had
built
towers
at
each
of
the
mouths
of
the
river
to
guard
the
entrance
and
had
selected
the
sites
for
his
garrison
fortresses
so
judiciously
that
they
were
kept
up
long
after
his
time
to
protect
the
country
two
of
them
are
mentioned
by
name
one
situated
below
pelusium
called
the
castle
of
chabrias
the
other
not
far
from
lake
mareotis
which
was
known
as
his
township
both
are
mentioned
by
strabo
the
exact
sites
of
these
two
places
are
not
yet
identified
diodorus
siculus
describing
the
defensive
preparations
of
egypt
does
not
state
expressly
that
they
were
the
work
of
chabrias
but
this
fact
seems
to
result
from
a
general
consideration
of
the
context

this
was
chosen
as

the

between

tithraustes

and
the

of
the
court
had
on
several
occasions
threatened
the
ruin
of
the
enterprise
but
pharnabazus
who
from
the
outset
had
held
supreme
command
succeeded
in
ridding
himself
of
his
rivals
and
in
the
spring
of
was
at
length
ready
for
the
advance
the

of
two

two
hundred

oars
and
numerous

superiority

was
on
the
side
of
the
persians
and
that
just
at
the
moment
when
nectanebo
lost
his
most
experienced
general
artaxerxes
had
remonstrated
with
the
athenians
for
permitting
one
of
their
generals
to
serve
in
egypt
in
spite
of
their
professed
friendship
for
himself
and
besides
insisting
on
his
recall
had
requested
for
himself
the
services
of
the
celebrated
iphicrates
the
athenians
complied
with
his
demand
and
while
summoning
chabrias
to
return
to
athens
despatched
iphicrates
to
syria
where
he
was
placed
in
command
of
the
mercenary
troops
pharnabazus
ordered
a
general
advance
in
may
but
when
he
arrived
before
pelusium
he
perceived
that
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
take
the
town
by
storm
not
only
had
the
fortifications
been
doubled
but
the
banks
of
the
canals
had
been
cut
and
the
approaches
inundated
iphicrates
advised
him
not
to
persevere
in
attempting
a
regular
siege
he
contended
that
it
would
be
more
profitable
to
detach
an
expeditionary
force
towards
some
less
point
on
the
coast
and
there
to
make
a
breach
in
the
system
of
defence
which
protected
the
front
as
kenrick
justly
observes
persian
and
athenian
generals
committed
the
same
mistake
which
led
to
the
defeat
of
saint
louis
and
the
capture
of
his
army
in
and
which
bonaparte
avoided
in
his
campaign
of
anyhow
it
seems
that
the
fault
must
be
laid
on
pharnabazus
alone
and
that
iphicrates
was
entirely
blameless
three
thousand
men
were
despatched
with
all
secrecy
to
the
mouth
of
the
mendesian
branch
of
the
nile
and
there
disembarked
unexpectedly
before
the
forts
which
guarded
the
entrance
the
garrison
having
imprudently
made
a
sortie
in
face
of
the
enemy
was
put
to
rout
and
pursued
so
hotly
that
victors

vanquished
entered

victory
was
certain
if
the
persians
pursued
their
advantage
promptly
and
pushed
forward
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
delta
the
moment
was
the
more
propitious
for
such
a
movement
since
nectanebo
had
drained
memphis
of
troops
to
protect
his
frontier
iphicrates
having
obtained
this
information
from
one
of
the
prisoners
advised
pharnabazus
to
proceed
up
the
nile
with
the
fleet
and
take
the
capital
by
storm
before
the
enemy
should
have
time
to
garrison
it
afresh
the
persian
general
however
considered
the
plan
too
hazardous
and
preferred
to
wait
until
the
entire
army
should
have
joined
him
iphicrates
offered
to
risk
the
adventure
with
his
body
of
auxiliary
troops
only
but
was
suspected
of
harbouring
some
ambitious
design
and
was
refused
permission
to
advance
meanwhile
these
delays
had
given
the
egyptians
time
to
recover
from
their
first
alarm
they
boldly
took
the
offensive
surrounded
the
position
held
by
pharnabazus
and
were
victorious
in
several
skirmishes
summer

the

more
rapidly
than
usual
and
soon

were
soon
after
disbanded
and
egypt
once
more
breathed
freely
the
check
received
by
the
persian
arms
however
was
not
sufficiently
notorious
to
shake
that
species
of
supremacy
which
artaxerxes
had
exercised
in
greece
since
the
peace
of
sparta
thebes
and
athens
vied
with
each
other
in
obtaining
an
alliance

keenly
as

for
a
rescript
similar
to
that
of
antalcidas
and
finally
athens
sent
a
solemn
embassy
to
entreat
for
a
subsidy
it
seemed
as
if
the
great
king
had
become
a
kind
of
supreme
arbiter
for
greece
and
that
all
the
states
hitherto
leagued
against
him
now
came
in
turn
to
submit
their
mutual
differences
for
his
decision
but
this
arbiter
who
thus
imposed
his
will
on
states
beyond
the
borders
of
his
empire
was
never
fully
master
within
his
own
domains
of
gentle
nature
and
pliant
disposition
inclined
to
clemency
rather
than
to
severity
and
moreover
so
lacking
in
judgment
as
a
general
that
he
had
almost
succumbed
to
an
attack
by
the
cadusians
on
the
only
occasion
that
he
had
in
a
whim
of
the
moment
undertaken
the
command
of
an
army
in
person
artaxerxes
busied
himself
with
greater
zeal
in
religious
reforms
than
in
military
projects
he
introduced
the
rites
of
mithra
and
anâhita
into
the
established
religion
of
the
state
but
he
had
not
the
energy
necessary
to
curb
the
ambitions
of
his
provincial
governors
asia

revolts
followed
closely
on

at

treachery
the
satraps
of
the
mediterranean
district
from
the
hellespont

isthmus

a
coalition
and

have

not

lavishly
employed
once
more
in
the

had
died
in
and
had
been
succeeded
by
tachôs
the
lists
of
manetho
assign
ten
or
eighteen
years
to
his
reign
a
sarcophagus
in
vienna
bears
the
date
of
his
fifteenth
year
and
the
great
inscription
of

speaks
of
gifts
he
made
to
the
temple
in
this
town
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
reign
the
reading
eighteen
is
therefore
preferable
to
the
reading
ten
in
the

manetho
if
the
very
obscure
text
of
the
really
applies
the
number
nine
or
ten
to
the
length
of
the
reign
this
reckoning
must
be
explained
by
some
mystic
calculations
of
the
priests
of
the
ptolemaic
epoch
the
name
of
this
king
written
by
the
greeks
teôs
or
tachôs
in
accordance
with
the
pronunciation
of
different
egyptian
dialects
has
been
discovered
in
hieroglyphic
writing
on
the
external
wall
of
the
temple
of
khonsu
at
karnak
the
new
pharaoh
deemed
the
occasion
opportune
to
make
a
diversion
against
persia
and
to
further
secure
his
own
safety
he
therefore
offered
his
support
to
the
satraps
who
sent
eheomitres
as
a
delegate
to
discuss
the
terms
of
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
having
inherited
from
nectanebo
a
large
fleet
and
a
full
treasury
tachôs
entrusted
to
the
ambassador
talents
of
silver
and
gave
him
fifty
ships
with
which
he
cruised
along
the
coast
of
asia
minor
towards
leukê
his
accomplices
were
awaiting
him
there
rejoicing
at
the
success
of
his
mission
but
he
himself
had
no
confidence
in
the
final
issue
of
the
struggle
and
merely
sought
how
he
might
enter
once
more
into
favour
with
the
persian
court
he
therefore
secured
his
safety
by
betraying
his
associates
he
handed
over
the
subsidies
and
the
egyptian
squadron
to
orontes
the
satrap
of
daskylium
and
then
seizing
the
insurgent
chiefs
sent
them
in
chains
to
susa
these
acts
of
treachery
changed
the
complexion
of
affairs
the
league
suddenly
dissolved
after
the
imprisonment
of
its
leaders
and
his
authority

egypt
became
once

the
principal
object
of
attack
and
by
the
irony
of
fate
pharaoh
had
himself
contributed
to
enrich
the
coffers
and
reinforce
the
fleet
of
his
foes
in
spite
of
this
mischance
however
circumstances
were
so
much
in
his
favour
that
he
ventured
to
consider
whether
it
would
not
be
more
advantageous
to
forestall
the
foe
by
attacking
him
rather
than
passively
to
await
an
onslaught
behind
his
own
lines
he
had
sought
the
friendship
of
athens
and
though
it
had
not
been
granted
in
explicit
terms
the
republic
had
nevertheless
permitted
ghabrias
to
resume
his
former
post
at
his
side
the
memory
of
this
embassy
has
been
preserved
for
us
by
a
decree
of
the
athenian
assembly
unfortunately
much
mutilated
which
has
been
assigned
to
various
dates
between
and
paul
foucart
has
shown
that
the
date
of
the
decree
must
be
referred
to
one
of
three
the
archonship
of
callimedes
that
of
eucharistus
or
that
of
cephisodotus
without
entering
into
a
discussion
of
the
other
evidence
on
the
subject
it
seems
to
me
probable
that
the
embassy
may
be
most
conveniently
assigned
to
the
archonship
of
callimedes
towards
the
end
of
at
the
moment
when
chabrias
had
just
arrived
in
egypt
and
was
certain
to
endeavour
to
secure
the
help
of
athens
for
the
king
he
served
chabrias
exhorted
him
to
execute
his
project
and
as
he
had
not
sufficient
money
to
defray
the
expenses
of
a
long
campaign
outside
his
own
borders
the
athenian
general
instructed
him
how
he
might
procure
the
necessary
funds
he
suggested
to
him
that
as
the
egyptian
priests
were
wealthy
the
sums
of
money
annually
assigned
to
them
for
the
sacrifices
and
maintenance
of
the
temples
would
be
better
employed
in
the
service
of
the
state
and
counselled
him
to
reduce
or
even
to
suppress
most
of
the
sacerdotal
colleges
the
priests
secured
their
own
safety
by
abandoning
their
personal
property
and
the
king
graciously
deigned
to
accept
their
gifts
and
then
declared
to
them
that
in
future
as
long
as
the
struggle
against
persia
continued
he
should
exact
from
them
of
their
sacred
revenues
this
tax
would
have
sufficed
for
all
requirements
if
it
had
been
possible
to
collect
it
in
full
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
very
soon
the
priests
must
have
discovered
means
of
avoiding
part
of
the
payment
for
it
was
necessary
to
resort
to
other
expedients
chabrias
advised
that
the
poll
and
house
taxes
should
be
increased
that
one
obol
should
be
exacted
for
each
of
corn
sold
and
a
tithe
levied
on
the
produce
of
all
yards
manufactories
and
manual
industries
money
now
poured
into
the
treasury
but
a
difficulty
arose
which
demanded
immediate
solution
egypt
possessed
very
little
specie
and
the
natives
still
employed
barter
in
the
ordinary
transactions
of
life
while
the
foreign
mercenaries
refused
to
accept
payment
in
kind
or
uncoined
metal
they
demanded
good
money
as
the
price
of
their
services
orders
were
issued
to
the
natives
to
hand
over
to
the
royal
exchequer
all
the
gold
and
silver
in
their
possession
whether
wrought
or
in
ingots
the
state
guaranteeing
gradual
repayment
through
the
nomarchs
from
the
future
product
of
the
and
the
bullion
so
obtained
was
converted
into
specie
for
the
payment
of
the
auxiliary
troops
these
measures
though
winning
some
unpopularity
for
tachôs
enabled
him
to
raise
eighty
thousand
native
troops
and
ten
thousand
greeks
to
equip
a
fleet
of
two
hundred
vessels
and
to
engage
the
best
generals
of
the
period
his
eagerness
to
secure
the
latter
however
was
injurious
to
his
cause
having
already
engaged
chabrias
and
obtained
the
good
will
of
athens
he
desired
also
to
gain
the
help
of
agesilaus
and
the
favourable
opinion
of
the
lacedaemonians
though
now
eighty
years
old
agesilaus
was
still
under
the
influence
of
cupidity
and
vanity
the
promise
of
being
placed
in
supreme
command
enticed
him
and
he
set
sail
with
one
thousand
hoplites
a
disappointment
awaited
him
at
the
moment
of
his
disembarkation
tachôs
gave
him
command
of
the
mercenary
troops
only
reserving
for
himself
the
general
direction
of
operations
and
placing
the
whole
fleet
under
the
orders
of
chabrias
the
aged
hero
having
vented
his
indignation
by
indulging
a
more
than
ordinary
display
of
spartan
rudeness
allowed
himself
to
be
appeased
by
abundant
presents
and
assumed
the
post
assigned
to
him
but
soon
after
a
more
serious
subject
of
disagreement
arose
between
him
and
his
ally
agesilaus
was
disposed
to
think
that
tachôs
should
remain
quietly
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
leave
to
his
generals
the
task
of
conducting
the
campaign
the
ease
with
which
mercenary
leaders
passed
from
one
camp
to
the
other
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
moment
was
not
calculated
to
inspire
the
egyptian
pharaoh
with
confidence
he
refused
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
agesilaus
and
entrusting
the
regency
to
one
of
his
relatives
proceeded
to
invade
syria
he
found
the
persians
unprepared
they
shut
themselves
up
in
their
strongholds
and
the
pharaoh
confided
to
his
cousin
nectanebo
son
of
the
regent
the
task
of
dislodging
them
the
war
dragged
on
for
some
time
discontent
crept
in
among
the
native
levies
and
brought
treachery
in
its
train
the
fiscal
measures
which
had
been
adopted
had
exasperated
the
priests
and
the
common
people
complaints
at
first
only
muttered
in
fear

as
soon
as

on
and

him
to
seize

nectanebo
could
easily
have
won
over

to
his
cause
but
their
support
would
have
proved
useless
as
long
as
the
greeks
did
not
pronounce
in
his
favour
and
chabrias
refused
to
break
his
oaths
agesilaus
however
was
not
troubled
by
the
same
scruples
his
vanity
had
been
sorely
wounded
by
the
pharaoh
after
being
denied
the
position
which
was
he
fancied
his
by
right
his
short
stature
his
and

coarseness
had
exposed
him
to
the
unseemly
mockery
of
the
courtiers

been
applied
to
him
it

when

him
to
bring

he
answered
ironically
that
he
was
there
to
help
the
egyptians
not
to
attack
them
and
before
giving
his
support
to
either
of
the
rival
claimants
he
should
consult
the
ephors

him
to
act

deserted
by
his
veterans
fled
to
sidon
and
thence
to
susa
where
artaxerxes
received
him
hospitably
and
without
reproaching
him
but
the
news
of
his
fall
was
not
received
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
with
as
much
rejoicing
as
he
had
anticipated
the
people
had
no
faith
in
any
revolution
in
which
the
greeks
whom
they
detested
took
the
chief
part
and
the
feudal
lords
refused
to
acknowledge
a
sovereign
whom
they
had
not
themselves
chosen
they
elected
one
of
their
number
the
prince
of
mendes
to
oppose
nectanebo
the
latter
was
obliged
to
abandon
the
possessions
won
by
his
predecessor
and
return
with
his
army
to
egypt
he
there
encountered
the
forces
of
his
enemy
which
though
as
yet
undisciplined
were
both
numerous
and
courageous
agesilaus
counselled
an
immediate
attack
before
these
troops
had
time
to
become
experienced
in
tactics
but
he
no
longer
stood
well
at
court
the
prince
of
mendes
had
endeavoured
to
corrupt
him
and
though
he
had
shown
unexpected
loyalty
many
nevertheless
suspected
his
good
faith
nectanebo
set
up
his
headquarters
at
tanis
where
he
was
shortly
blockaded
by
his
adversary
it
is
well
known
how
skilfully
the
egyptians
handled
the
and
how
rapidly
they
could
construct
walls
of
great
strength
the
circle
of
entrenchments
was
already
near
completion
and
provisions
were
beginning
to
fail
when
agesilaus
received
permission
to
attempt
a
sortie
he
broke
through
the
besieging
lines
under
cover
of
the
night
and
some
days
later
won
a
decisive
victory
nectanebo
would
now
have
gladly
kept
the
spartan
general
at
his
side
for
he
was
expecting
a
persian
attack
but
agesilaus
who
had
had
enough
of
egypt
and
its
intrigues
deserted
his
cause
and
shortly
afterwards
died
of
exhaustion
on
the
coast
near
cyrene
the
anticipated
persian
invasion
followed
shortly
after
but
it
was
conducted
without
energy
or
decision
artaxerxes
had
entrusted
the
conduct
of
the
expedition
to
tachôs
doubtless
promising
to
reinstate
him
in
his
former
power
as
satrap
or
vassal
king
of
egypt
but
tachôs
died
before
he
could
even
assume
his
post
and
the
discords
which
rent
the
family
of
the
persian
king
prevented
the
generals
who
replaced
him
from
taking
any
effective
action
ælian
narrates
probably
following
dinon
that
tachôs
died
of
dysentery
due
to
at
dinner
the
aged
artaxerxes
had
had
it
was
reported
one
hundred
and
fifteen
sons
by
the
different
women
in
his
harem
but
only
three
of
those
by
his
queen
statira
were
now
living
darius
ariaspes
and
ochus
darius
the
eldest
of
the
three
had
been
formally
recognised
as
perhaps
at
the
time
of
the
disastrous
war
against
the
but
the
younger
brother
ochus
who
secretly
aspired
to
the
throne
had
managed
to
inspire
him
with
anxiety
with
regard
to
the
succession
and
incited
him
to
put
the
aged
king
out
of
the
way
contemporary
historians
ill
informed
as
to
the
intrigues
in
the
palace
whose
effects
they
noted
without
any
attempt
to
explore
their
intricacies
invented
several
stories
to
account
for
the
conduct
of
the
young
prince
some
assigned
as
the
reason
of
his
conspiracy
a
romantic
they
said
that
cyrus
the
younger
had
had
an
ionian
mistress
named
aspasia
who
after
the
fatal
battle
of
cunaxa
had
been
taken
into
the
harem
of
the
conqueror
and
had
captivated
him
by
her
beauty
darius
conceived
a
violent
passion
for
this
damsel
and
his
father
was
at
first
inclined
to
give
her
up
to
him
but
afterwards
repenting
of
his
complaisance
consecrated
her
to
the
service
of
mithra
a
cult
which
imposed
on
her
the
obligation
of
perpetual
chastity
darius
exasperated
by
this
treatment
began
to
contemplate
measures
of
vengeance
but
being
betrayed
by
his
brother
ochus
was
put
to
death
with
his
whole
family
pompeius
trogus
asserts
that
such
were
contrary
to
persian
law
we
have
seen
above
that
on
the
contrary
they
were
obligatory
when
the
sovereign
was
setting
out
on
a
campaign
this
is
the
version
of
the
story
given
by
dinon
and
accepted
by
pompoius
trogus
a
chronological
calculation
easily
demonstrates
its
unlikelihood
it
follows
from
the
evidence
given
by
justin
himself
that
artaxerxes
died
of
grief
soon
after
the
execution
of
his
son
but
on
the
other
hand
that
the
battle
of
cunaxa
took
place
in
aspasia
must
then
have
been
fifty
or
sixty
years
old
when
darius
fell
in
love
with
her
by
the
removal
of
this
first
obstacle
the
crafty
prince
found
himself
only
one
step
nearer
success
for
his
brother
ariaspes
was
acknowledged
as
ochus
therefore
persuaded
him
that
their
father
convinced
of
the
complicity
of
ariaspes
in
the
plot
imputed
to
darius
intended
to
put
him
to
an
ignominious
death
and
so
worked
upon
him
that
he
committed
suicide
to
escape
the
executioner
a
bastard
named
arsames
who
might
possibly
have
aspired
to
the
crown
was
assassinated
by
ochus
this
last
blow
was
too
much
for
artaxerxes
and
he
died
of
grief
after
a
reign
of
years
ochus
who
immediately
assumed
the
name
of
artaxerxes
began
his
reign
by
the
customary
massacre
he
put
to
death
all
the
princes
of
the
royal
family
and
having
thus
rid
himself
of
all
the
rival
claimants
to
the
supreme
power
he
hastened
on
preparations
for
the
war
with
egypt
which
had
been
interrupted
by
his
death
and
his
own
accession
this
is
the
length
attributed
by
plutarch
to
this
reign
and
which
is
generally
accepted
it
was
narrated
in
days
that
the
king
kept
the
fact
of
his
death
hidden
for
ten
months
but
it
is
impossible
to
tell
how
much
truth
there
is
in
this
statement
which
was
accepted
by
dinon
according
to
the
author
followed
by
pompeius
trogus
the
princesses
themselves
were
involved
in
this
massacre
this
is
certainly
an
exaggeration
for
we
shall
shortly
see
that
darius
the
last
king
of
persia
was
accounted
to
be
the
grandson
of
darius
ii
the
massacre
can
only
have
involved
the
direct
heirs
of
artaxerxes
the
necessity
for
restoring
persian
dominion
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
was
then
more
urgent
than
at
any
previous
time
during
the
which
had
elapsed
since
the
recovery
of
her
independence
egypt
had
been
a
perpetual
source
of
serious
embarrassment
to
the
great
king
the
contemporaries
of
amyrtseus
whether
greeks
or
barbarians
had
at
first
thought
that
his
revolt
was
nothing
more
than
a
local
rising
like
many
a
previous
one
which
had
lasted
but
a
short
time
and
had
been
promptly
suppressed
but
when
it
was
perceived
that
the
native
dynasties
had
taken
a
hold
upon
the
country
and
had
carried
on
a
successful
contest
with
persia
in
spite
of
the
immense
disproportion
in
their
respective
resources
when
not
only
the
bravest
soldiers
of
asia
but
the
best
generals
of
greece
had
miserably
failed
in
their
attacks
on
the
frontier
of
the
delta
phoenicia
and
syria
began
to
think
whether
what
was
possible
in
africa
might
not
also
be
possible
in
asia
from
that
time
forward
whenever
a
satrap
or
vassal
prince
meditated
revolt
it
was
to
egypt
that
he
turned
as
a
natural
ally
and
from
egypt
he
sought
the
means
to
carry
out
his
project
however
needy
the
pharaoh
of
that
day
might
be
he
was
always
able
to
procure
for
such
a
suitor
sufficient
money
munitions
of
war
ships
and
men
to
enable
him
to
make
war
against
the
empire
the
attempt
made
by
ochus
failed
as
all
previous
attempts
had
done
the
two
adventurers
who
commanded
the
forces
of
nectanebo
the
athenian
diophantes
and
lamius
of
sparta
inflicted
a
disastrous
defeat
on
the
imperial
troops
and
forced
them
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
this
defeat
was
all
the
more
serious
in
its
consequences
because
of
the
magnitude
of
the
efforts
which
had
been
made
the
king
himself
was
in
command
of
the
troops
and
had
been
obliged
to
turn
his
back
precipitately
on
the
foe
the
syrian
provinces
which
had
been
in
an
unsettled
condition
ever
since
the
invasion
under
tachôs
flew
to
arms
nine
petty
kings
of
cyprus
including
evagoras
nephew
of
the
famous
prince
of
that
name
refused
to
pay
tribute
and
artabazus
roused
asia
minor
to
rebellion
the
phoenicians
still
hesitated
but
the
insolence
of
their
satrap
the
rapacity
of
the
generals
who
had
been
repulsed
from
egypt
and
the
lack
of
discipline
in
the
persian
army
forced
them
to
a
decision
in
a
convention
summoned
at
tripoli
the
representatives
of
the
phoenician
cities
conferred
on
tennes
king
of
sidon
the
perilous
honour
of
conducting
the
operations
of
the
confederate
army
and
his
first
act
was
to
destroy
the
royal
villa
in
the
lebanon
and
his
next
to
burn
the
provisions
which
had
been
accumulated
in
various
ports

of

rebellions

in

supported
by

exasperated
at

of
success
called
out
every
available
soldier
three
hundred
thousand
asiatics
and
ten
thousand
greeks
the
sidonians
on
their
side
dug
a
triple
trench
round
their
city
raised
their
ramparts
and
set
fire
to
their
ships
to
demonstrate
their
intention
of
holding
out
to
the
end
unfortunately
their
king
tennes
was
not
a
man
of
firm
resolution
hitherto
he
had
lived
a
life
of
surrounded
by
the
women
of
his
harem
whom
he
had
purchased
at
great
cost
in
ionia
and
greece
and
had
made
it
the
chief
object
of
his
ambition
to
surpass
in
magnificence
the
most
ostentatious
princes
of
cyprus
especially
nicocles
of
salamis
son
of
evagoras
the
approach
of
ochus
confused
his
scanty
wits
he
endeavoured
to
wipe
out
his
treachery
towards
his
suzerain
by
the
betrayal
of
his
own
subjects
he
secretly
despatched
his
confidential
minister
a
certain
thessalion
to
the
persian
camp
promising
to
betray
sidon
to
the
persian
king
and
to
act
as
his
guide
into
egypt
on
condition
of
having
his
life
preserved
and
his
royal
rank
guaranteed
to
him
ochus
had
already
agreed
to
these
conditions
when
an
impulse
of
vanity
on
his
part
nearly
ruined
the
whole
arrangement
thessalion
not
unreasonably
doubting
the
good
faith
had
demanded
that
he
should
swear
by
his
right
hand
to
fulfil
to
the
letter
all
the
clauses
of
the
treaty
whereupon
ochus
whose
dignity
was
offended
by
this
insistence
gave
orders
for
the
execution
of
the
ambassador
but
as
the
latter
was
being
dragged
away
he
cried
out
that
the
king
could
do
as
he
liked
but
that
if
he
disdained
the
help
of
tennes
he
would
fail
in
his
attacks
both
upon
phonicia
and
egypt
these
words
produced
a
sudden
reaction
and
thessalion
obtained
all
that
he
demanded
when
the
persians
had
arrived
within
a
few
march
of
sidon
tennes
proclaimed
that
a
general
assembly
of
the
phoenician
deputies
was
to
be
held
and
under
pretext
of
escorting
the
hundred
leading
men
of
his
city
to
the
appointed
place
of
meeting
led
them
into
the
camp
where
they
were
promptly
despatched
by
the
javelins
of
the
soldiery
the
sidonians
deserted
by
their
king
were
determined
to
carry
on
the
struggle
in
the
expectation
of
receiving
succour
from
egypt
but
the
persian
darics
had
already
found
their
way
into
the
hands
of
the
mercenary
troops
and
the
general
whom
nectanebo
had
lent
them
declared
that
his
men
considered
the
position
desperate
and
that
he
should
surrender
the
city
at
the
first
summons
the
sidonians
thereupon
found
themselves
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
imploring
the
mercy
of
the
conqueror
and
five
hundred
of
them
set
out
to
meet
him
as
suppliants
carrying
olive
branches
in
their
hands
bub
ochus
was
the
most
cruel
monarch
who
had
ever
reigned
in
persia
the
only
one
perhaps
who
was
really
bloodthirsty
by
nature
he
refused
to
listen
to
the
entreaties
of
the
suppliants
and
like
the
preceding
hundred
delegates
they
were
all
slain
the
remaining
citizens
perceiving
that
they
could
not
hope
for
pardon
barricaded
themselves
in
their
houses
to
which
they
set
fire
with
their
own
hands
forty
thousand
persons
perished
in
the
flames
and
so
great
was
the
luxury
in
the
appointments
of
the
private
houses
that
large
sums
were
paid
for
the
right
to
dig
for
the
gold
and
silver
ornaments
buried
in
the
ruins
the
destruction
of
the
city
was
almost
as
complete
as
in
the
days
of
esarhaddon
when
sidon
had
thus
met
her
fate
the
persians
had
no
further
reason
for
sparing
its
king
tennes
and
he
was
delivered
to
the
executioner
whereupon
the
other
phoenician
kings
terrified
by
his
fate
opened
their
gates
without
a
struggle
once
more
the
treachery
of
a
few
traitors
had
disconcerted
the
plans
of
the
pharaoh
and
delivered
the
outposts
of
egypt
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
but
ochus
renewed
his
preparations
with
marvellous
tenacity
and
resolved
to
neglect
nothing
which
might
contribute
to
his
final
success
his
victories

confirmed
the
cities
of

only
six
thousand

twenty
thousand

number
of

the
remembrance
of
the
successes
won
by
himself

his
predecessors
with
inferior
numbers
inspired
him
with
confidence

issue

could
not
have
ventured
to
meet
in
battle
the
combined
squadrons
of

phoenicia

on

other
hand
he
had
a
sufficient
number
of
boats
to

the

along

covered

plans
were
sufficiently
well
laid
to
ensure
success
in
a
defensive
war

the
rash
ardour
of

greek
mercenaries

not
defeated

the
egyptians
understood
how
to
use
the
spade
as
well
as
the
lance
and
while
the
outer

was
crumbling
they
improvised
behind
it

nectanebo
who
had
come
up
with
thirty
thousand
native
five
thousand
greek
troops
and
half
the
libyan
contingent
observed
the
vicissitudes
of
the
siege
from
a
short
distance
and
by
his
presence
alone
opposed
the
advance
of
the
bulk
of
the
persian
army
weeks
passed
by
the
time
of
the
inundation
was
approaching
and
it
seemed
as
if
this
policy
of
delay
would
have
its
accustomed
success
when
an
unforeseen
incident
decided
in
a
moment
the
fate
of
egypt
among
the
officers
of
ochus
was
a
certain
nicostratus
of
argos
who
on
account
of
his
prodigious
strength
was
often
compared
to
heracles
and
who
out
of
vanity
dressed
himself
up
in
the
traditional
costume
of
that
hero
the
skin
and
the
club
having
imbibed
doubtless
the
ideas
formerly
propounded
by
iphicrates
nicostratus
forced
some
peasants
whose
wives
and
children
he
had
seized
as
hostages
to
act
as
his
guides
and
made
his
way
up
one
of
the
canals
which
traverse
the
marshes
of
menzaleh
there
he
disembarked
his
men
in
the
rear
of
nectanebo
and
took
up
a
very
strong
position
on
the
border
of
the
cultivated
land
this
enterprise
undertaken
with
a
very
insufficient
force
was
an
extremely
rash
one
if
the
egyptian
generals
had
contented
themselves
with
harassing
nicostratus
without
venturing
on
engaging
him
in
a
pitched
battle
they
would
speedily
have
forced
him
to
or
to
lay
down
his
arms
unfortunately
however
five
thousand
mercenaries
who
formed
the
garrison
of
one
of
the
neighbouring
towns
hastened
to
attack
him
under
the
command
of
clinias
of
cos
and
suffered
a
severe
defeat
as
a
result
the
gates
of
the
town
were
thrown
open
to
the
enemy
and
if
the
persians
encouraged
by
the
success
of
this
forlorn
hope
had
followed
it
up
boldly
nectanebo
would
have
run
the
risk
of
being
cut
off
from
his
troops
which
were
around
pelusium
and
of
being
subsequently
crushed
he
thought
it
wiser
to
retreat
towards
the
apex
of
the
delta
but
this
very
act
of
prudence
exposed
him
to
one
of
those
accidental
misfortunes
which
are
wont
to
occur
in
armies
formed
of
very
diverse
elements
while
he
was
concentrating
his
reserves
at
memphis
the
troops
of
the
first
line
thought
that
by
leaving
them
exposed
to
the
assaults

the
imbecility
of

artaxerxes
ii
had
reduced
the
empire

it
is
quite
certain
that
the
disastrous
effects
of
their
misgovernment
were
not
confined

were
felt
no
less
acutely

eastern

central
regions

system
built
up

the
cost

much
ingenuity

gradually
being
broken
down

could
no

power

intervals

its
mandates
were
not
intercepted

degenerated

meaningless
formality

more
often

not
dispensed
with
altogether

line
of
demarcation

the
military

power

been
obliterated

the
originally
independent
offices

in

it
had
lost

independence
had
lost

little
of
its
wealth
its
former
rebellions
had
done
it
no
great
injury
and
its
ancient
cities
were
still
left
standing

shorn
of
their
early
splendour

it

no
less
famous
throughout
the
east
than
those
of
borsippa
the

however
which
surrounded
it
possessed
few
attractions
and
greek
travellers
rarely
ventured
thither
they
generally
stopped
at
babylon
or
if
they
ventured
off
the
beaten
track
it
was
only
to
visit
the
monuments
of
nebuchadrezzar
or
the
tombs
of
the
early
kings
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
babylon
was
indeed
one
of
the
capitals
of
the
empire
nay
for
more
than
half
a
century
during
the
closing
years
of
artaxerxes
in
the
reign
of
darius
and
in
the
early
days
of
artaxerxes
il
it
had
been
the
real
capital
even
under
ochus
the
court
spent
the
winter
months
there
and
resorted
thither
in
quest
of
those
resources
of
industry
and
commerce
which
susa
lacked
the
material
benefits
due
to
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
seem
to
have
reconciled
the
city
to
its
subject
condition
there
had
been
no
seditious
movement
there
since
the
rising
of
shamasherîb
which
xerxes
had
quelled
with
ruthless
severity
the
greek
mercenaries
or
traders
who
visited
it
though
prepared
for
its
huge
size
by
general
report
could
not
repress
a
feeling
of
astonishment
as
they
approached
it
first
of
all
there
was
the
triple
wall
of
nebuchadrezzar
with
its
moats
its
rows
of
towers
and
its
colossal
gateways
unlike
the
greek
cities
it
had
been
laid
out
according
to
a
regular
plan
and
formed
a
perfect
square
inside
which
the
streets
crossed
one
another
at
right
angles
some
parallel
to
the
euphrates
others
at
right
angles
to
it
every
one
of
the
latter
terminated
in
a
brazen
gate
opening
through
the
masonry
of
the
quay
and
giving
access
to
the
river
the
passengers
who
crowded
the
streets
included
representatives
of
all
the
asiatic
races
the
native
babylonians
being
recognisable
by
their
graceful
dress
consisting
of
a
linen
tunic
falling
to
the
feet
a
fringed
shawl
round
cap
and
heavy
staff
terminating
in
a
knob
from
this
background
stood
out
many
novel
features
calculated
to
stimulate
greek
curiosity
such
as
the
sick
persons
exposed
at
in
order
that
they
might
beg
the
to
prescribe
for
them
the
prostitution
of
her
votaries
within
the
courts
of
the
goddess
mylitta
and
the
disposal
of
marriageable
girls
by
auction
herodotus
however
regretted
that
this
latter
custom
had
fallen
into
abeyance
and
yet
to
the
attentive
eye
of
a
close
observer
even
babylon
must
have
furnished
many
unmistakable
symptoms
of
decay
the
huge
boundary
wall
enclosed
too
large
an
area
for
the
population
sheltered
behind
it
whole
quarters
were
crumbling
into
heaps
of
ruins
and
the
flower
and
vegetable
gardens
were
steadily
encroaching
on
spaces
formerly
covered
with
houses
public
buildings
had
suffered
quite
as
much
as
private
dwellings
from
the
persian
wars
xerxes
had
despoiled
the
temples
and
no
restoration
had
been
attempted
since
his
time
the

of

lay
half
buried
already
beneath
piles
of
rubbish
the
golden
statues
which
had
once
stood
within
its
chambers
had
disappeared
and
the
priests
no
longer
carried
on
their
astronomical
observations
on
its
platform
herodotus
merely
mentions
that
xerxes
had
despoiled
the
temple
strabo
tells
us
that
alexander
wished
to
restore
it
but
that
it
was
in
such
a
state
of
dilapidation
that
it
would
have
taken
ten
thousand
men
two
months
merely
to
remove
the
rubbish
the
palaces
of
the
ancient
kings
were
falling
to
pieces
from
lack
of

the
famous
hanging

in
the

were
still
shown
to

gave
them
out
to
be

such

they
considered
likely
to
make
their

more
amusing
but
others
took
pains
to
collect
information
of
a
more
solid
character
and
before
they
had
carried
their
researches
very
far
were
at
once
astounded
and
delighted
with
the
glimpses
they
obtained
of
chaldæan
genius
no
doubt
they
exaggerated
when
they
went
so
far
as
to
maintain
that
all
their
learning
came
to
them
originally
from
babylon
and
that
the
most
famous
scholars
of
greece
pherecydes
of
scyros
democritus
of
abdera
and
pythagoras
owed
the
rudiments
of
philosophy
mathematics
physics
and
astrology
to
the
school
of
the
the
story
which
asserts
that
pythagoras
served
under
nergilos
king
of
assyria
is
probably
based
on
some
similarity
of
names
thus
among
the
greek
kings
of
cyprus
and
in
the
time
of
we
find
one
whose
name
would
recall
that
of
pythagoras
if
the
accuracy
of
the
reading
were
beyond
question
yet
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
should
have
believed
this
to
be
the
case
when
increasing
familiarity
with
the
priestly
seminaries
revealed
to
them
the
existence
of
those
libraries
of
clay
tablets
in
which
side
by
side
with
theoretic
treatises
dating
from
two
thousand
years
back
and
more
were
to
be
found
examples
of
applied
mechanics
observations
reckonings
and
novel
solutions
of
problems
which
generations
of
scribes
had
accumulated
in
the
course
of
centuries
the
greek
astronomers
took
full
advantage
of
these
documents
but
it
was
their
astrologers
and
soothsayers
who
were
specially
indebted
to
them
the
latter
acknowledged
their
own
inferiority
the
moment
they
came
into
contact
with
their
euphratean

the
cultivated

employed
by
the
scribes
of
nineve
and
babylon
in
the
palmy
days
of
their
race
had
long
become
a
sort
of
literary
dialect
used
in
writings
of
a
lofty
character
and
understood
by
a
select
few
but
unintelligible
to
the
common
people
the
populace
in
town
or
country
talked
an
aramaic
jargon
clumsier
and
more
prolix
than
assyrian
but
easier
to
understand
we
know
how
successfully
the
aramæans
had
managed
to
push
their
way
along
the
euphrates
and
into
syria
towards
the
close
of
the
hittite
supremacy
their
successive
encroachments
had
been
favoured
first
by
the
assyrian
later
by
the
chaldæan
conquests
and
now
they
had
become
sole
possessors
of
the
ancient
naharaîna
the
plains
of
cilicia
the
basin
of
the
orontes
and
the
country
round
damascus
but
the
true
home
of
the
aramæans
was
in
syria
rather
than
in
the
districts
of
the
lower
euphrates
even
in
the
time
of
the
sargonids
their
alphabet
had
made
so
much
headway
that
at
nineveh
itself
and
at
calah
it
had
come
into
everyday
use
when
chaldæan
supremacy
gave
way
to
that
of
the
persians
its
triumph
in
the
western
provinces
at
any
rate
was
complete
and
it
became
the
recognised

royal

hebrew
gave
way
before

ended
by
being
restricted

religious
purposes

and
liturgical

it
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
babylon
itself
that
the
judæan
exiles
had
during
the
captivity
adopted
the
aramaic
language
and
their
return
to
canaan
failed
to
restore
either
the
purity
of
their
own
language
or
the
dignity
and
independence
of
their
religious
life
their
colony
at
jerusalem
possessed
few
resources
the
wealthier
hebrews

for
the
most
part
remained
in

the
privilege
of
repopulating
the
holy
city

those
of
their

were
less
plenteously

its
expansion
southwards
was
checked
by
the
idumæans

whom
nebuchadrezzar
had
years
before
handed
over

acrabattenê

as

installed

in

at

these

paid
no
reverence
to
the
of
the
land
so
that
jahveh
in
order
to
punish
them
sent
lions
which
spread
carnage
in
their
ranks
then
the
king
of
assyria
allotted
them
an
israelitish
priest
from
among
his
prisoners
who
taught
them
of

and
appointed
other

chosen
from
the
people

them
how
to

do
not
seem
to
have
been
the
continual
disputes
between
the
inhabitants
of
judaea
and
samaria
before
the
return
of
nehemiah
which
the
compilers
of
the
books
of
ezra
and
nehemiah
seem
to
have
believed
thus
another
israel
began
to
rise
up
again
and
at
first
the
new
judah
seems
to
have
been
on
tolerably
friendly
terms
with
it
the
two
communities
traded
and
intermarried
with
one
another
the
samaritans
took
part
in
the
religious
ceremonies
and
certain
of
their
leaders
occupied
a
court
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
the
alliance
however
proved
dangerous
to
the
purity
of
the
faith
for
the
proselytes
while
they
adopted

and
gave
him
that
supreme
place
in
their
devotions

which
in
the
days
of
its
independence
had
so
often
turned
aside
after
the
gods
of
canaan
and
moab
was
in
danger
of
being
led
away
by
the
idolatrous
practices
of
its
new
neighbours
intermarriage
with
the
daughters
of
moab
and
ammon
of
philistia
and
samaria
was
producing
a
gradual
degeneracy
the
national
language
was
giving
way
before
the
aramaean
unless
some
one
could
be
found
to
stem
the
tide
of
decadence
and
help
the
people
to
remount
the
slope
which
they
were
descending
the
fate
of
judah
was
certain
a
prophet
the
last
of
those
whose
predictions
have
survived
to
our
time
stood
forth
amid
the
general
laxity
and
called
the
people
to
account
for
their
transgressions
in
the
name
of
the
eternal
but
his
single
voice
which
seemed
but
a
feeble
echo
of
the
great
prophets
of
former
ages
did
not
meet
with
a
favourable
hearing
salvation
came
at
length
from
the
jews
outside
judah
the
naturalised
citizens
of
babylon
a
and
wealthy
body
occupying
high
places
in
the
administration
of
the
empire
and
sometimes
in
the
favour
of
the
sovereign
also
yet
possessed
by
an
ardent
zeal
for
the
religion
of
their
fathers
and
a
steadfast
faith
in
the
vitality
of
their
race
one
of
these
a
certain
nehemiah
was
employed
as
cupbearer
to
artaxerxes
ii
he
was
visited
at
susa
by
some
men
of
judah
whose
business
had
brought
them
to
that
city
and
inquired
of
them
how
matters
fared
in
jerusalem
hanani
one
of
his
visitors
replied
that
remnant
that
are
left
of
the
captivity
there
in
the
province
are
in
great
affliction
and
reproach
the
wall
of
jerusalem
also
is
broken
down
and
the
gates
thereof
are
burned
with
nehemiah
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
the
king
seemed
in
a
jovial
mood
to
describe
the
wretched
state
of
his
native
land
in
moving
terms
he
obtained
leave
to
quit
susa
and
authority
to
administer
the
city
in
which
his
fathers
had
dwelt
nehemiah
ii
this
took
place
in
the
twentieth
year
of
artaxerxes
about
nehemiah
at
once
made
his
way
to
jerusalem
with
such
escort
as
befitted
his
dignity
and
the
news
of
his
mission
and
apparently
the
sentiments
of
rigid
orthodoxy
professed
by
him
from
the
beginning
provoked
the
resentment
of
the
neighbouring
potentates
against
him
sanballat
the
horonite
tobiah
the
ammonite
chief
of
the
samaritans
and
geshem
the
bedâwin
did
their
best
to
thwart
him
in
the
execution
of
his
plans
he
baffled
their
intrigues
by
his
promptitude
in
rebuilding
the
walls
and
when
once
he
had
rendered
himself
safe
from
any
sudden
attack
he
proceeded
with
the
reforms
which
he
deemed
urgent
his
tenure
of
office
lasted
twelve
years
from
to
and
during
the
whole
of
that
time
he
refused
to
accept
any
of
the
dues
to
which
he
was
entitled
and
which
his
predecessors
had
received
without
scruple
ever
since
their
return
from
exile
the
common
people
had
been
impoverished
and
paralysed
by
usury
the
poor
had
been
compelled
to
mortgage
their
fields
and
their
vineyards
in
order
to
pay
the
taxes
then
when
their
land
was
gone
they
had
pledged
their
sons
and
their
daughters
the
moneyed
classes
of
the
new
israel
thus
absorbed
the
property
of
their
poorer
brethren
and
reduced
the
latter
to
slavery
nehemiah
called
the
usurers
before
him
and
severely
rebuking
them
for
their
covetousness
bade
them
surrender
the
interest
and
capital
of
existing
debts
and
restore
the
properties
which
had
fallen
into
their
hands
owing
to
their
shameful
abuse
of
wealth
and
release
all
those
of
their
whom
they
had
enslaved
in
default
of
payment
of
their
debts
his
high
place
in
the
royal
favour
doubtless
had
its
effect
on
those
whose
cupidity
suffered
from
his
zeal
and
prevented
external
enemies
from
too
openly
interfering
in
the
affairs
of
the
community
by
the
time
he
returned
to
the
court
in
after
an
absence
of
twelve
years
jerusalem
and
its
environs
had
to
some
extent
regained
the
material
prosperity
of
former
days
the
part
played
by
nehemiah
was
however
mainly
political
and
the
religious
problem
remained
in
very
much
the
same
state
as
before
the
high
priests
who
alone
possessed
the
power
of
solving
it
had
fallen
in
with
the
current
that
was
carrying
away
the
people
and
latterly
at
any
rate
had
become
disqualified
through
intermarriage
with
aliens
what
was
wanted
was
a
scribe
deeply
versed
in
sacred
things
to
direct
them
in
the
right
way
and
such
a
man
could
be
found
only
in
babylonia
the
one
country
in
which
the
study
of
the
ancient
traditions
still
flourished
a
certain
ezra
son
of
seraiah
presented
himself
in
and
as
he
was
a
man
of
some
standing
artaxerxes
not
only
authorised
him
to
go
himself
but
to
take
with
him
a
whole
company
of
priests
and
lévites
and
families
formerly
attached
to
the
service
of
the
temple
the
books
containing
the
law
of
god
and
the
history
of
his
people
had
since
the
beginning
of
the
captivity
undergone
alterations
which
had
profoundly
modified
their
text
and
changed
their
spirit
neh
neh
xiii
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
of
artaxerxes
king
of
babylon
i
went
unto
the
this
work
of
revision
begun
under
the
influence
of
ezekiel
and
perhaps
by
his
own
followers
had
since
his
time
been
carried
on
without
interruption
and
by
mingling
the
juridical
texts
with
narratives
of
the
early
ages
collected
from
different
sources
a
lengthy
work
had
been
produced
very
similar
in
composition
and
wording
to
the
five
books
of
moses
and
the
book
of
joshua
as
we
now
possess
them
it
was
this
version
of
the
revelation
of
jahveh
that
ezra
brought
with
him
from
babylon
in
order
to
instruct
the
people
of
judah
and
the
first
impressions
received
by
him
at
the
end
of
his
journey
convinced
him
that
his
task
would
be
no
light
one
for
the
number
of
mixed
marriages
had
been
so
great
as
to
demoralise
not
only
the
common
people
but
even
the
priests
and
leading
nobles
as
well
nevertheless
at
a
general
of
the
people
he
succeeded
in
persuading
them
to
consent
to
the
repudiation
of
alien
wives
this
is
the
priestly
revision
presupposed
by
recent
critics
here
again
in
order
to
keep
within
the
prescribed
limits
of
space
i
have
been
compelled
to
omit
much
that
i
should
have
liked
to
add
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
this
work
and
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
carried
out
ezra
where
the
dates
given
do
not
form
part
of
the
work
as
written
by
ezra
but
have
been
introduced
later
by
the
editor
of
the
book
as
it
now
stands
but
this
preliminary
success
would
have
led
to
nothing
unless
he
could
secure
formal
recognition
of
the
rigorous
code
of
which
he
had
constituted
himself
the
champion
and
protracted
negotiations
were
necessary
before
he
could
claim
a
victory
on
this
point
as
well
as
on
the
other
at
length
about
more
than
a
year
after
his
arrival
he
gained
his
point
and
the
covenant
between
jahveh
and
his
people
was
sealed
with
ceremonies
modelled
on
those
which
had
attended
the
promulgation
of
deuteronomy
in
the
time
of
josiah
on
the
first
day
of
the
seventh
month
a
little
before
the
autumn
festival
the
people
assembled
at
jerusalem
in
broad
place
which
was
before
the
water
ezra
mounted
a
wooden
pulpit
and
the
chief
among
the
priests
sat
beside
him
he
the
book
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
and
all
the
people
stood
up
and
ezra
blessed
the
lord
the
great
god
and
all
the
people
answered
amen
with
the
lifting
up
of
their
hands
and
they
bowed
their
heads
and
worshipped
the
lord
with
their
faces
to
the
then
began
the
reading
of
the
sacred
text
as
each
clause
was
read
the
lévites
stationed
here
and
there
among
the
people
interpreted
and
explained
its
provisions
in
the
vulgar
tongue
so
as
to
make
their
meaning
clear
to
all
the
prolix
enumeration
of
sins
and
their
expiation
and
threats
expressed
in
certain
chapters
produced
among
the
crowd
the
same
effect
of
nervous
terror
as
had
once
before
been
called
forth
by
the
precepts
and
maledictions
of
deuteronomy
the
people
burst
into
tears
and
so
vehement
were
their
manifestations
of
despair
that
all
the
efforts
of
ezra
and
his
colleagues
were
needed
to
calm
them
ezra
took
advantage
of
this
state
of
fervour
to
demand
the
immediate
application
of
the
divine
ordinances
and
first
of
all
it
was
written
in
the
law
how
that
the
lord
had
commanded
by
moses
that
the
children
of
israel
should
dwell
in
for
seven
days
jerusalem
was
decked
with
leaves
tabernacles
of
olive
myrtle
and
palm
branches
rose
up
on
all
sides
on
the
roofs
of

that
were
happening

up

who
appealed
most
strongly
to
the
imagination
of
the

greek
traders

even
tourists
wandered
freely
within

eakôtis
the
first
port
at

they
touched
was
a

its
rocky
pharos

no
claim
to
distinction
beyond
the
fact
that
it
had
been
mentioned
by

they
followed
the

them

the

states
that

incredulity

have
been
quickened
by

so

during

when
the
whole

from
the
mountains
of

to
those
of

was
nothing
but
one
vast
river
a
vessel
seemed
to
sail
in

shadow
for
a
long
time
before
it
reached
their

passed

next
the

the

itself

of
some
hours
came
to
anchor
by
the
quays
of
memphis
to
the
greeks
of
that
time
memphis
was
very
much
what
cairo
is
to
us
viz
the
typical
oriental
city
the
quintessence
and
chief
representative
of
ancient
egypt
in
spite
of
the
disasters
which
had
overwhelmed
it
during
the
last
few
centuries
it
was
still
a
very
beautiful
city
ranking
with
babylon
as
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
its
religious
festivals
especially
those
in
honour
of
apis
attracted
numberless
pilgrims
to
it
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
and
hosts
of
foreigners
recruited
from
every
imaginable
race
of
the
old
continent
resorted
to
it
for
purposes
of
trade
most
of
the
nationalities
who
frequented
it
had
a
special
quarter
which
was
named
after
them
the
phoenicians
occupied
the
the
greeks
and
carians
the

and

and
there
were
oaromemphites
or
hellenomemphites

inhabitants
a
persian
garrison
was
stationed
within
the

ready
to
execute

and
could
have

for
a
long
time

after
the
rest

had
fallen
into

animals
which
one
would
scarcely
have
expected
to
find
in
the
streets
of
a
capital
such
as
cows
sheep
and
goats
wandered
about
unheeded
in
the
most
crowded
thoroughfares
for
the
common
people
instead
of
living
apart
from
their
beasts
as
the
greeks
did
stabled
them
in
their
own
houses
nor
was
this
the
only
custom
which
must
have
seemed
strange
in
the
eyes
of
a
newly
arrived
visitor
for
the
egyptians
might
almost
have
been
said
to
make
a
point
of
doing
everything
differently
from
other
the
baker
seen
at
the
inside
his
shop
worked
the
dough
with
his
foot
on
the
other
hand
the
mason
used
no
trowel
in
applying
his
mortar
and
the
poorer
classes
scraped
up
handfuls
of
mud
mixed
with
dung
when
they
had
occasion
to
repair
the
walls
of
their
hovels
in
greece
even
the
very
poorest
retired
to
their
houses
and
ate
with
closed
doors
the
egyptians
felt
no
repugnance
at
eating
and
drinking
in
the
open
air
declaring
that
unbecoming
and
improper
acts
should
be
performed
in
secret
but
seemly
acts
in
public
the
first
blind
alley
they
came
to
a
recess
between
two
hovels
the
doorstep
of
a
house
or
temple
any
of
these
seemed
to
them
a
perfectly
natural
place
to
dine
in
their
bill
of
fare
was
not
a
sumptuous
one
a
sort
of
flat
pancake
somewhat
bitter
in
taste
and
made
not
of
corn
or
barley
but
of
spelt
a
little
oil
an
onion
or
a
leek
with
an
occasional
scrap
of
meat
or
poultry
washed
down
by
a
jug
of
beer
or
wine
there
was
nothing
here
to
tempt
the
foreigner
and
besides
it
would
not
have
been
thought
right
for
him
to
invite
himself
a
greek
who
lived
on
the
flesh
of
the
cow
was
looked
upon
as
unclean
in
the
highest
degree
no
egyptian
would
have
thought
of
using
the
same
pot
or
knife
with
him
or
of
kissing
him
on
the
mouth
by
way
of
greeting
moreover
egyptian
etiquette
did
not
tolerate
the
same
familiarities
as
the
greek
two
friends
on
catching
sight
of
one
another
paused
before
they
met
bowed
then
clasped
one
another
round
the
knees
or
pretended
to
do
so
young
people
gave
way
to
an
old
man
or
if
seated
rose
to
let
him
pass
the
traveller
recalled
the
fact
that
the
spartans
behaved
in
the
same
way
and
approved
this
mark
of
deference
but
nothing
in
his
had
prepared
him
for
the
sight
of
respectable
women
coming
and
going
as
they
pleased
without
escort
and
unveiled
carrying
burdens
on
their
shoulders
whereas
the
men
carried
them
on
their
heads
going
to
market
keeping
stalls
or
shops
while
their
husbands
or
fathers
stayed
comfortably
at
home
wove
cloth
kneaded
the
clay
or
turned
the
wheel
and
worked
at
their
trades
no
wonder
that
they
were
ready
to
believe
that
the
man
was
the
slave
and
the
wife
the
mistress
of
the
family
some
historians
traced
the
origin
of
these
customs
back
to
osiris
others
only
as
far
as
sesostris
sesostris
was
the
last
resource
of
greek
historians
when
they
got
into
difficulties
the
city
was
crowded
with
monuments
there
was
the
temple
of
the
phoenician
astarte
in
which
priests
of
syrian
descent
had
celebrated
the
mysteries
of
the
great
goddess
ever
since
the
days
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
then
there
was
the
temple
of

the
temple
of

the
temple
of

the
temple
of

and
the
temple

foreign
aphrodite

by

egyptians
as
a
counterpart
of

the

with

a
microcosm
of

history
in
which
each
image
inscription

aroused
the
attention
of

curious
they
naturally
desired
to
learn
who

strangely
dressed

shown
struggling
in

the
name
of

king
who
had
conquered
them
and
the
reasons
which
had
led
him
to
construct
this
or
that
part
of

there
were
plenty
of
busybodies
ready
to
satisfy
as
far
as
they
could
the
curiosity
of

were
at

who
bartered
such
information
as
they
possessed
and
the
modern
traveller
who
has
had
occasion
to
employ
the
services
of
a
dragoman
will
have
no
difficulty
in
estimating
the
value
of
intelligence
thus
hawked
about
in
ancient
times
priests
of
the
lower
class
doorkeepers
and
sacristans
were
trained
to
act

been
familiar
with
the
names

was

apt
to
attribute
to
them
everything
of
importance

as

most
of
the
characters
glibly
enumerated
by
herodotus
it
would
be
labour
lost
to
search
for
their
names
among
the
inscriptions
they
are
mere
puppets
of
popular
romance
some
of
their
names

more
than
epithets

to

can
understand
how
strangers
placed
at
the

misled
by
this
and
tempted
to
transform
each
title
into

man

to
be

the
excursions
made
by
the
greek
traveller
in
the
environs
of
memphis
were
very
similar
to
those
taken
by
modern
visitors
to
cairo
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
nile
there
was
heliopolis
with
its

there
were

had
been
worked
from
time
immemorial

never
exhausted
and
from
which
the

probably
lay
hidden

the

those
at

were
held
in
small
esteem
by
visitors

was
the
most
ancient
of
all
having
been
erected
by
uenephes
one
of

they
asked
no
further
questions
herodotus
does
not
mention
it
nor
does
any

itself
they
heard
the
same
names
that
had
been
dinned
into
their
ears
at
memphis
the
whole
of
the
monuments
were
made
to
fit
into
a
single
cycle
of
popular
history

what
they
learned
at

place
completed

seemed
to
complete

they

last
century
who
undertook
to
reach

their
point
of
departure
memphis

was
very
much
the

destinations
elephantine
and

differed
but
little
they
employed
the

an
exact
counterpart
of
the

fourteen

spent
at

if
the
diary
of

greek
excursionist

tourist
had
come
down
to
us
we
should
probably
find
in
it
entries
of
a
very
similar
kind
the
departure
from
memphis
would
take
place
in
november
or
december
ten
or
twelve
days
later
the
traveller
would
find
himself
at
panopolis
from
panopolis
to
elephantine
stopping
at
coptos
and

would
take
about
a
month
allowing
time
for
a
stay
at
thebes
and
returning
to
memphis
in
february
or
march
herodotus
fixes
twenty
days
for
the
voyage
from
sais
to
elephantine
this
period
of
time
must
be
probably
correct
since
at
the
present

dahabeahs
constantly
run
from
cairo
to
the
second
cataract
and
back
in
two
months
including
stoppages
of
ten
days
to
a
fortnight
for
seeing
the
monuments
the
twenty
days
of
herodotus
represent
the
minimum
duration
of
the
voyage
without
taking
into
account
the
stoppages
and
accidents
which
often
delay
sailing
vessels
on
the
nile
nine
days
which
herodotus
gives
as
the
time
for
reaching
thebes
is
not
sufficient
if
the
voyage
is
undertaken
in
the
usual
way
stopping
every
evening
for
the
night
but
it
would
be
possible
if
the
navigation
were
uninterrupted

night
this
is
now
rarely
done
but
it
might
have
been
frequent
in
ancient
times
especially
in
the
service
of
the
state
it
would
seem
clear
that
herodotus
stopped
at
panopolis
and
had
communications
with
the
people

the
town

was
not

keenly
alive
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
scenes
through
which
he
passed
as
the
modern

in
the

he
took

at

would

what
interested
him
above
all
things
was
information
with

the
sources
of
the
immense
river
itself
and
the
reasons
for
its
periodic
inundation
and
according
to
the
mental
attitude
impressed
on
him
by
his
education
he
accepted
the
mythological
solution
offered
by
the
natives
or
he
sought
for
a
more
natural
one
in
the
physical
lore
of
his
own
thus
he
was
told
that
the
nile
took
its
rise
at
elephantine
between
the
two
rocks
called
krôphi
and
môphi
and
in
showing
them
to
him
his
informant
would
add
that
psammetichus
had
attempted
to
sound
the
depth
of
the
river
at

failed

fathom
it
at

the

the

showed
themselves
unfriendly

what
most
astonished
herodotus
at
panopolis
was
the
temple
and
the
games
held
in
honour
so
he
believed
of

son
of

exercises
terminated

epithets

confounded
by
the
greek
ear
with
the
name
of
the
hero
the
dragomans
enlarging
on
this
mistaken
identity
imagined
that
the
town
was
the
birthplace
of
danaos
and
lyncseus
that
perseus
returning
from
libya
with
the
head
of
medusa
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
visit
the
cradle
of
his
family
and
that
he
had
instituted
the
games
in
remembrance
of
his
stay
there
thebes
had
become
the
ghost
of
its
former
self
the
persian
governors
had
neglected
the
city
and
its
princesses
and
their
ministers
were
so
impoverished
that
they
were
unable
to
keep
up
its
temples
and
palaces
herodotus
scarcely
mentions
it
and
we
can
hardly
wonder
at
it
he
had
visited
the
still
flourishing
memphis
where
the
temples
were
cared
for
and
were
filled
with
worshippers
what
had
thebes
to
show
him
in
the
way
of
marvels
which
he
had
not
already
seen
and
that
too
in
a
better
state
of
preservation
his
theban
ciceroni
also
told
him
the
same
stories
that
he
had
heard
in
lower
egypt
and
he
states
that
their
information
agreed
in
the
main
with
that
which
he
had
received
at
memphis
and
heliopolis
which
made
it
unnecessary
to
repeat
it
at
length
two
or
three
things
only
appeared
to
him
worthy
of
mention
his
admiration
was
first
roused
by
the
statues
of
the
high
priests
of
amon
which
had
already
excited
the
wonder
of
his
rival
hecataeus
he
noted
that
all
these
personages
were
without
exception
represented
as
mere
men
each
the
son
of
another
man
and
he
took
the
opportunity
of
ridiculing
the
vanity
of
his
compatriots
who
did
not
hesitate
to
inscribe
the
name
of
a
god
at
the
head
of
their
genealogies
removed
by
some
score
of
generations
only
from
their
own
on
the
other
hand
the
temple
servitors
related
to
him
how
two
theban
priestesses
carried
off
by
the
phoenicians
and
sold
one
in
libya
and
the
other
in
greece
had
set
up
the
first
oracles
known
in
those
two
countries
herodotus
thereupon
remembered
the
story
he
had
heard
in
epirus
of
two
black
doves
which
had
flown
away
from
thebes
one
towards
the
oasis
of
ammon
the
other
in
the
direction
of
dodona
the
latter
had
alighted
on
an
old
beech
tree
and
in
a
human
voice
had
requested
that
a
temple
consecrated
to
zeus
should
be
founded
on
the
spot
this
indicates
a
confusion
in
the
minds
of
the
egyptian
dragomans
with
the
two
brooding
birds
of
osiris
isis
and
nephthys
considered
as
that
is
to
say
as
two
birds
of
a
different
species
according
to
the
different
traditions
either
vultures
rooks
or
doves
herodotus
is
quite
overcome
with
joy
at
the
thought
that
greek
divination
could
thus
be
directly
traced
to
that
of
egypt
for
like
most
of
his
contemporaries
he
felt
that
the
hellenic
cult
was
ennobled
by
the
fact
of
its
being
derived
from
the
egyptian
the
traveller
on
the
nile
had
to
turn
homewards
on
reaching
elephantine

that
was
the
station
of
the
last
persian
garrison
nubia
lay
immediately
beyond
the
cataract
and
the
ethiopians
at
times
crossed
the
frontier
and
carried
their
raids
as
far
as
thebes
elephantine

assuan
at
the
present
day
was
the
centre
of
a
flourishing
trade
here
might
be
seen
kushites
from
napata
or
meroë
negroes
from
the
upper
nile
and
the
bahr
and
ammonians
from
all
of
whom
the
curious
visitor
might
glean
information
while
frequenting
the
bazaars
the
cataract
was
navigable
all
the
year
round
and
the
natives
in
its
vicinity
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
piloting
freight

through
its
difficult
channel
it
took
four
days
to
pass

it

of
the
three

even
two

the
present

out
and
resembled
a
lake
dotted
over
with
islands
several

which
such
as
phike
and
biggeh
contained
celebrated
temples
which
were
as
much
frequented
by
the
ethiopians
as
by
the
egyptians
correctly
speaking
it
was
not
egypt
herself
that
the
greeks
saw
but
her
external
artistic
aspect
and
the
outward
setting
of
egyptian
civilisation
the
vastness
of
her
monuments
the
splendour
of
her
tombs
the
pomp
of
her
ceremonies
the
dignity
and
variety
of
her
religious
formulas
attracted
their
curiosity
and
commanded
their
respect
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians

passed
into
a
proverb
with
them
as
it
had
with
the
hebrews
but
if
they
had
penetrated
behind
the
scenes
they
would
have
been
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
beneath
this
attractive
exterior
there
was
hopeless
decay
as
with
all
creatures
when
they
have
passed
their
prime

daily
losing

elasticity

spirit

sunk
into

torpor

had
become
unresponsive
to
her
environment
and
could
no
longer
adapt
herself
to
the
form
she
had
so
easily
acquired
in
her
youth
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
occupy
fully
the
narrower
limits
to
which
she
had
been
reduced
and
to
maintain
those
limits
unbroken
the
instinct
which
made
her
shrink
from
the
intrusion
of
foreign
customs
and
ideas
or
even
mere
contact
with
nations
of
recent
growth
was
not
the
mere
outcome
of
vanity
she
realised
that
she
maintained
her
integrity
only
by
relying
on
the
residue
of
her
former
solidarity
and
on
the
force
of
custom
the
slightest
disturbance
of
the
equilibrium
established
among
her
members
instead
of
strengthening
her
would
have
robbed
her
of
the
vigour
she
still
possessed
and
brought
about
her
dissolution

that

detested
in

was
not
exactly
the
fact

their
national
pride
indeed
always
prompted
them
to
devise
some
means
of
connecting
the
foreign
monarch
with
their
own
solar
line
and
to
transform
an
achæmenian
king
into
a
legitimate
pharaoh
that
which
was
especially
odious
to
them
in
a
cambyses
or
an

was
the
disdain
which
such
sovereigns
displayed
for
their
religion
and
the
persecution
to
which
they
subjected
the
immortals
they
accustomed
themselves
without
serious
repining
to
have
no

upon

behold
their
cities

preferred
his

would
not
admit

ochus
had
by

treatment
of

apis
and

other
divine
animals
put
it
out
of
his
power
ever
to
win
their
good

had
made
an
irreconcilable
enemy
of
that
state
which
alone
gave
signs
of
vitality
among
the
nations
of
the
decaying
east
this
was
all
the
more
to
be
regretted
since
the
persian
empire
in
spite
of
the
accession
of
power
which
it
had
just
manifested
was
far
from
having
regained
the
energy
which
had
animated
it
not
perhaps
in
the
time
of
darius
but
at
all
events
under
the
first
xerxes
the
army
and
the
wealth
of
the
country
were
doubtless
still
intact
an
army
and
a
revenue
which
in
spite
of
all
losses
were
still
the
largest
in
the
world
but
the
valour
of
the
troops
was
not
proportionate
to
their
number
the
former
prowess
of
the
persians
medians
bactrians
and
other
tribes
of
iran
showed
no
degeneracy
these
nations
still
produced
the
same
race
of
brave
and
hardy
the
same
active
and
intrepid
horsemen
but
for
a
century
past
there
had
not
been
the
improvements
either
in
the
armament
of
the
troops
or
in
the
tactics
of
the
generals
which
were
necessary
to
bring
them
up
to
the
standard
of
excellence
of
the
greek
army
the
persian
king
placed
great
faith
in
extraordinary
military
machines
he
believed
in
the
efficacy
of
chariots
armed
with
scythes
besides
this
his
relations
with
india
had
shown
him
what
use
his
oriental
neighbours
made
of
elephants
and
having
determined
to
employ
these
animals
he
had
collected
a
whole
corps
of
them
from
which
he
hoped
great
things
in
spite
of
the
addition
of
these
novel
recruits
it
was
not
on
the
asiatic
contingents
that
he
chiefly
relied
in
the
event
of
war
but
on
the
mercenaries
were
hired
at
great
expense
and
who
formed
the
chief
support
of
his
power
from
the
time
of
artaxerxes
ii
onwards
it
was
the
greek
hoplites
and

who
had
always
decided
the
issue

battles

by

conduct
of

and
their
pupils

again
also
it
was
to

had
owed
his

all

their

they
had
declined

and
assyria
had
for
a
short
time
united
them
under
her
rule
on
the
downfall
of
assyria
the
iranians
had
succeeded
to
her
heritage
and
they
had
built
up
a
single
empire
comprising
all
the
states
which
had
preceded
them
in
western
asia
but
decadence
had
fallen
upon
them
also
and
when
they
had
been
masters
for
scarcely
two
short
centuries
they
were
in
their
turn
threatened
with
destruction
their
rule
continued
to
be
universal
not
by
reason
of
its
inherent
vigour
but
on
account
of
the
weakness
of
their
subjects
and
neighbours
and
a
determined
attack
on
any
of
the
frontiers
of
the
empire
would
doubtless
have
resulted
in
its
overthrow
greece
herself
was
too
demoralised
to
cause
darius
any
grave
anxiety
not
only
had
she
renounced
all
intention
of
attacking
the
great
king
in
his
own
domain

in
the
days
of
the
athenian
hegemony
when
she
could
impose
her
own
conditions
of
peace
but
her
perpetual
discords
had
yielded
her
an
easy
prey
to
persia
and
were
likely
to
do
so
more
and
more
the
greek
cities
chose
the
great
king
as
the
arbiter
in
their
quarrels
they
vied
with
each
other
in
obtaining
his
good
will
his
subsidies
in
men
and
vessels
and
his
darics
they
armed
or
disarmed
at
his
command
and
the
day
seemed
at
hand
when
they
would
become

at

recognised
the
danger
which
threatened
his

in

did
not

give
substantial
support
to

adversaries
of

macedonian
prince

of
thrace
and
the
town
of

receiving
from
him
such
succour
as
enabled
them
to
repulse
philip
successfully
unfortunately
while
bagoas
was
endeavouring
to
avert
danger
in
this
quarter
his
rivals
at
court
endeavoured
to
prejudice
the
mind
of
the
king
against
him
and
their
intrigues
were
so
successful
that
he
found
himself
ere
long
condemned
to
the
alternative

murdering
his

himself

therefore

end
as

of
the
vengeance
of

had
outraged

was

murder
of

that
when
he
was

of
his
own
safety
he
had
avenged
the
sacrilege
as
soon
as

had
taken
effect

ate

to
be
devoured
is
a
detail
added
by
the
popular
imagination
which
crops
up
again
in
the
tale
of
satni
khâmois
ochus
had
astonished
his
contemporaries
by
the
rapidity
with
which
he
had
the
integrity
of
the
empire
they
were
pleased
to
compare
him
with
the
heroes
of
his
race
with
cyrus
cambyses
and
darius
but
to
exalt
him
to
such
a
level
said
little
for
their
moral
or
intellectual
perceptions
since
in
spite
of
his
victories
he
was
merely
a
despot
of
the
ordinary
type
his
tenacity
degenerated
into
brutal
obstinacy
his
severity
into
cruelty
and
if
he
obtained
successes
they
were
due
rather
to
his
generals
and
his
ministers
than
to
his
own
ability
his
son
arses
was
at
first
content
to
be
a
docile
instrument
in
the
hands
of
bagoas
but
when
the
desire
for
independence
came
to
him
with
the
habitual
exercise
of
power
and
he
began
to
chafe
at
his
bonds
the
eunuch
sacrificed
him
to
his
own
personal
safety
and
took
his
life
as
he
had
done
that
of
his
father
in
the
preceding
year
so
many
murders
following
each
other
in
rapid
succession
had
considerably
reduced
the
achsemenian
family
and
bagoas
for
a
moment
was
puzzled
where
to
find
a
king
he
at
length
decided
in
favour
of
codomannos
who
according
to
some
was
a
of
darius
but
according
to
others
was
not
of
the
royal
line
but
had
in
his
youth
been
employed
as
a
courier
he
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
hostilities
against
the
casduians
and
had
been
nominated
satrap
of
armenia
by
ochus
as
a
reward
for
his
bravery
he
assumed
at
his
accession
the
name
of
darius
brave
generous
clement
and
possessed
with
an
ardent
desire
to
do
right
he
was
in
every
way
the
superior
of
his
immediate
predecessors
and
he
deserved
to
have
reigned
at
a
time
when
the
empire
was
less
threatened
bagoas
soon
perceived
that
his
new
protégé
whose
conduct
he
had
reckoned
on
directing
as
he
pleased
intended
to
govern
for
himself
and
he
therefore
attempted
to
get
rid
of
him
bagoas
was
however
betrayed
by
his
accomplices
and
compelled
to
drink
the
poison
which
he
had
prepared
for
darius
these
revolutions
had
distracted
the
attention
of
the
court
of
susa
from
the
events
which
were
taking
place
on
the
shores
of
the
ægean
and
philip
had
taken
advantage
of
them
to
carry
into
effect
the
designs
against
persia
which
he
had
been
long
meditating
after
having
been
victorious
against
the
greeks
he
had
despatched
an
army
of
ten
thousand
men
into
asia
under
the
command
of
parmenion
and
attains
we
may
ask
if
it
were
not
he
who
formed
the
project
of
universal
conquest
which
was
so
soon
to
be
associated
with
the
name
of
his
son
alexander
he
was
for
the
moment
content
to
excite
revolt
among
the
cities
of
the
ægean
littoral
and
restore
to
them
that
liberty
of
which
they
had
been
deprived
for
nearly
a
century
he
himself
followed
as
soon
as
these
lost
children
of
greece
had
established
themselves
firmly
in
asia
the
story
of
his
assassination
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
is
well
known
and
of
the
difficulties
which
compelled
alexander
to
suspend
the
execution
of
the
plans
which
his
father
had
made
darius
attempted
to
make
use
of
the
respite
thus
afforded
him
by
fortune
he
adopted
the
usual
policy
of
liberally
bribing
one
part
of
greece
to
take
up
arms
against
macedonia
a
method
which
was
at
first
successful
while
alexander
was
occupied
in
the
destruction
of
thebes
the
rhodian
general
memnon
to
whom
had
been
entrusted
the
defence
of
asia
minor
forced
the
invaders
to
entrench
themselves
in
the
troad
if
the
persian
fleet
had
made
its
appearance
in
good
time
and
had
kept
an
active
watch
over
the
straits
the
of
the
macedonians
would
have
succumbed
to
the
enemy
before
the
main
body
of
the
troops
had
succeeded
in
joining
them
in
asia
and
it
was
easy
to
foretell
what
would
have
been
the
fate
of
an
enterprise
inaugurated
by
such
a
disaster
persia
however
had
not
yet
learnt
to
seize
the
crucial
moment
for
action
her
vessels
were
still
arming
when
the
enemy
made
their
appearance
on
the
european
shore
of
hellespont
and
alexander
had
ample
time
to
embark
and
disembark
the
whole
of
his
army
without
having
to
draw
his
sword
from
the
scabbard

was
accompanied
by
about
thirty
thousand
foot
soldiers

him

followed

but
tyre
closed
its
gates
and
trusted
to
its
insular
position
for
the
preservation
of
its
independence
as
it
had
done
of
old
in
the
time
of
sennacherib
and
of

it
was
not
so
much
a
scrupulous
feeling
of
loyalty
which
emboldened
her
to
take
this
step
as
a
keen
realisation
of
what
her
conquest
by
the
macedonian
would
entail
it
was
to
persia
that
she
had
not
succumbed
in
all
parts
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
in
that
struggle
with
greece
which
had
now
lasted
for
centuries
persia
had
not
only
arrested
the
progress
of
hellenic
colonisation
in

had
given
a
fresh
impulse
to
that
of
tyre
and
phoenician
influence
had
regained
its
ascendency
over
a
considerable
part
of
the
island
the
surrender
of
tyre
therefore
would
be
equivalent
to
a
greek
victory
and
would
bring
about
the
decay
of
the
city
hence
its
inhabitants
preferred
hostilities
and
they
were
prolonged
in
desperation
over
a
period
of
seven
months
at
the
end
of
that
time
alexander
succeeded
in
reducing
the
place
by
constructing
a
dyke

causeway
by
means
of
which
he
brought
his
machines
of
war
up
to
the
foot
of
the
ramparts
and
filled
in
the
channel
which
separated
the
town
from
the
mainland
the
island
thus
became
a
peninsula
and
tyre
henceforth
was
reduced
to
the
rank
of
an
ordinary
town
still
able
to
maintain
her
commercial
activity

having
lost
her
power

independent

occupied
positions
which
were

which
he
gave
his
own
name

had
been
in
the
choice
of

site

than
half
a
century
from
the
date

had
eclipsed

the
other
capitals
of

eastern
mediterranean

had
become
the
centre
of

hellenism
while
its
construction
was
in
progress
alexander
having
had
opportunities
of
studying
the
peculiarities
and
characteristics
of
the
egyptians
had
decided
to
perform
the
one
act
which
would
conciliate
the
good
feeling
of
the
natives
and
secure
for
him
their
fidelity
during
his
wars
in
the
east
he
selected
from
among
their
gods
the
one
who
was
also
revered
by
the
greeks
and
repaired
to
the
oasis
that
he
might
be
adopted
by
the
deity
as
a
son
of
the
god
he
became
a
legitimate
pharaoh
an
egyptian
like
themselves
and
on
returning
to
memphis
he
no
longer
hesitated
to
adopt
the
crown
with
the
accompanying
ancient
rites
he
returned
to
asia
early
in
the
year

crossed

minor
from
his
grasp

antigonus
the
governor
of

had
dispersed

fearlessly
into
