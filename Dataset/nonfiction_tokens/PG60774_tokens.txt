preface
the
time
at
which
this
volume
appears
would
seem
to
require
a
few
words
of
introduction
a
day
which
closes
a
great
epoch
in
the
history
of
modern
times
will
soon
be
called
to
the
remembrance
of
protestant
christians
the
registers
of
the
consistory
of
geneva
for
the
year
bear
under
the
name
of
calvin
these
simple
words

the
author
of
this
volume
having
been
invited
by
the
evangelical
alliance
to
deliver
an
address
on
reformation
and
the
reformer
of
during
the
œcumenical
conference
held
at
geneva
in
september
observed
in
the
course
of
his
preparatory
work
this
important
date
and
proposed
to
the
assembly
that
on
the
tercentenary
of
the
reformer
death
geneva
and
the
reformed
churches
in
general
should
return
thanks
publicly
to
god
that
he
had
raised
up
john
calvin
in
the
sixteenth
century
to
labour
at
the
reformation
of
the
church
by
holy
scripture
as
the
supreme
authority
and
grace
as
the
only
means
of
salvation
the
members
of
the
conference
about
two
thousand
in
number
adopted
the
resolution
by
acclamation
as
christian
protestants
were
preparing
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
the
author
desired
to
contribute
something
according
to
his
ability
towards
reviving
the
memory
of
the
great
doctor
almost
at
the
very
time
when
the
idea
of
this
protestant
festival
occurred
to
his
mind
he
proposed
to
describe
in
a
special
work
reformation
of
europe
in
the
time
of
having
published
the
first
two
volumes
more
than
a
year
ago
he
looked
forward
to
issuing
another
before
the
may
and
he
now
presents
it
to
the
public
may
it
occupy
its
humble
place
among
the
memorials
destined
to
commemorate
the
lord
work
the
persecuting
jesuitry
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
superficial
incredulity
of
the
eighteenth
have
calumniated
the
great
reformer
of
the
west
times
have
changed
and
the
nineteenth
century
is
beginning
to
do
him
justice
his
works
even
those
still
in
manuscript
are
sought
after
and
published
his
life
and
character
his
theology
and
influence
are
the
object
of
numerous
studies
which
in
general
bear
the
stamp
of
fairness
and
even
distinguished
painters
have
found
the
subject
of
their
finest
pictures
in
his
life
we
entertain
no
blind
admiration
for
him
we
know
that
he
has
sometimes
used
bitter
language
we
acknowledge
that
sharing
in
the
faults
of
his
century
or
rather
of
ten
centuries
he
believed
that
whatever
infringed
on
the
respect
due
to
god
ought
to
be
punished
by
the
civil
power
quite
as
much
as
anything
that
might
be
injurious
to
the
honour
or
the
life
of
man
we
deplore
this
error
but
how
can
any
one
study
with
discernment
the
reformer
letters
and
other
writings
and
not
recognise
in
him
one
of
the
noblest
intelligences
one
of
the
most
elevated
minds
one
of
the
most
affectionate
hearts
and
in
short
one
of
those
true
christian
souls
who
unreservedly
devote
themselves
to
duty
an
eminent
scholar
whom
scotland
still
cunningham
the
successor
of
in
a
work
published
a
short
time
before
his
death
is
the
man
who
next
to
paul
has
done
most
good
to
mankind
no
doubt
he
will
always
have
his
enemies
a
journal
of
high
character
and
great
circulation
in
germany
speaking
of
a
libel
is
the
word
used
published
some
time
ago
against
calvin
asks
what
camp
does
it
jesuitical
romanism
or
atheistical
libertinism
it
is
indeed
from
these
quarters
that
the
enemies
of
the
reformer
principally
come
but
we
acknowledge
that
a
man
may
be
opposed
to
calvin
and
yet
not
belong
to
either
of
these
schools
let
us
not
disquiet
ourselves
however
about
such
attacks
master
has
said
they
do
these
things
in
a
green
tree
what
shall
be
done
in
the
dry
the
author
of
the
present
volume
thinks
that
the
best
way
of
doing
justice
to
his
memory
is
to
make
him
known
the
reader
will
meet
in
this
work
with
many
sayings
and
doings
of
this
great
man
which
are
not
to
be
found
in
other
histories
if
a
writer
had
the
good
fortune
to
lay
before
the
german
public
some
unknown
trait
of
luther
life
all
germany
would
be
taken
up
with
it
shall
we
be
more
indifferent
to
the
life
of
our
great
reformer
certainly
there
are
more
striking
actions
in
the
life
of
luther
who
so
easily
gains
possession
of
our
hearts
but
we
may
ask
whether
there
are
not
features
in
the
life
of
calvin
which
are
less
frequent
in
that
of
the
wittemberg
doctor
the
manner
for
instance
in
which
the
young
doctor
of
noyon
wherever
he
happens
to
be
at
angoulême
poitiers
is
at
once
surrounded
by
distinguished
men
whom
he
wins
over
to
the
truth
the
author
desires
however
to
remind
some
of
his
readers
that
this
book
is
not
the
history
of
calvin
the
title
expresses
that
clearly
enough
of
the
in
europe
the
time
of
it
is
the
second
series
of
a
work
of
which
the
of
the
reformation
of
the
sixteenth
was
the
first
the
reformation
of
the
western
nations
of
which
calvin
was
the
soul
having
a
special
character
we
thought
it
our
duty
to
devote
a
special
work
to
it
but
we
shall
not
confine
ourselves
to
relating
the
facts
of
the
reformation
in
which
calvin
took
a
direct
part
one
portion
of
the
fourth
volume
will
describe
the
reformation
in
england
from
the
fall
of
wolsey
we
purpose
also
to
continue
retracing
the
leading
features
of
the
reformation
in
germany
as
we
have
already
done
in
the
first
two
volumes
of
this
work
in
which
the
alliance
of
smalkalde
the
peace
of
nuremberg
the
emancipation
of
wurtemberg
and
other
analogous
events
have
found
their
place
it
is
the
reformation
as
a
whole
which
the
author
desires
to
delineate
after
speaking
of
france
and
calvin
the
author
relates
in
the
present
volume
facts
which
concern
latin
switzerland
suisse
romande
the
waldensian
villages
of
piedmont
and
finally
geneva
he
does
not
think
it
proper
to
pass
by
unnoticed
certain
reproaches
which
the
first
two
volumes
have
brought
upon
him
is
a
strange
idea
some
have
said
devote
so
much
space
to
geneva
is
it
not
doing
too
much
honour
to
a
little
city
of
a
few
thousand
souls
history
requires
great
people
and
mighty
personages
we
meet
with
these
at
least
around
luther
but
in
geneva
we
find
none
but
humble
syndics
and
petty
citizens
true
it
is
so
in
this
part
of
our
history
we
have
to
deal
with
a
little
city
and
a
little
people
and
even
in
this
democratic
age
there
are
persons
who
will
put
up
with
nothing
but
electors
and
kings
may
we
be
permitted
to
reply
that
what
is
small
as
regards
outward
appearances
is
sometimes
important
as
regards
moral
influence
this
is
a
truth
often
reverted
to
in
holy
scripture
ships
though
they
be
so
great
yet
are
they
turned
about
with
a
very
small
this
portion
of
our
narrative
contains
two
parts
one
is
devoted
to
a
the
other
to
a
these
two
existences
seem
in
the
eyes
of
many
persons
to
evolve
separately
as
if
they
were
never
to
meet
but
there
is
a
close
relation
between
them
from
the
very
beginning
they
are
destined
to
unite
each
is
energetic
though
without
parade
and
their
alliance
will
in
some
future
day
double
their
strength
when
calvin
and
geneva
are
one
many
men
and
nations
will
feel
their
powerful
and
salutary
influence
it
is
a
marriage
that
will
produce
a
numerous
and
active
posterity
whatever
the
friends
of
worldly
greatness
may
say
this
union
when
it
took
place
was
an
event
of
more
importance
to
the
human
race
than
that
which
led
a
panegyrist
of
louis
xiv
to
exclaim
in
reference
to
a
celebrated
les
bourbons
ces
enfants
des
dieux
unissent
leurs
tiges
fécondes
the
idea
expressed
above
will
not
be
generally
accepted
the
smallness
of
the
scene
which
it
unfolds
will
prevent
the
second
work
from
interesting
so
much
as
the
first
and
yet
there
have
been
critics
who
have
felt
the
importance
of
the
history
of
geneva
may
we
be
permitted
to
give
a
few
examples
the
says
the
narrowness
of
the
small
variety
of
characters
presented
may
well
astonish
us
the
is
big
enough
to
hold
an
image
of
the
heavens
and
earth
and
a
city
closely
studied
mirrors
an
empire
the
story
is
crowded
with
incidents
and
surprises
with
heroic
deeds
and
endurance
and
also
with
foul
deeds
and
shames
some
reviewers
have
gone
so
far
as
to
place
the
facts
of
the
second
work
above
those
of
the
first
the
york
says
story
of
the
times
in
which
the
swiss
reformation
was
wrought
is
surrounded
with
a
sublimity
romantic
grandeur
and
interest
that
attach
to
no
part
of
the
great
german
movement
under
luther
we
omit
the
remarks
of
other
journals
particularly
of
the
which
rejoices
to
see
genevese
champions
of
liberty
brought
to
light
we
must
however
quote
one
more
the
which
says
is
one
of
the
smallest
and
one
of
the
most
heroic
cities
of
europe
had
it
been
predicted
its
history
would
have
been
incredible
geneva
defied
not
only
the
duke
of
savoy
and
the
pope
but
the
emperor
charles
and
dared
also
his
scarcely
less
powerful
rival
francis
and
in
spite
of
them
all
it
won
first
its
political
and
then
its
religious
liberties
and
not
for
itself
only
but
for
northern
europe
more
than
once
it
was
the
thermopylæ
of
protestantism
and
freedom
bravely
held
by
an
heroic
little
band
scarcely
more
in
comparison
with
those
who
sought
to
destroy
them
than
the
three
hundred
men
of
leonidas
in
comparison
with
the
persians
but
if
the
opinions
of
some
were
favourable
to
the
little
city
the
criticisms
of
others
were
not
so
and
as
the
author
will
again
speak
of
geneva
in
this
volume
and
god
willing
in
others
he
desires
to
say
a
word
of
explanation
with
reference
to
these
objections
if
the
work
is
found
uninteresting
the
fault
must
be
ascribed
to
the
historian
not
to
the
history
the
talent
of
one
of
the
great
masters
of
history
would
have
prevented
all
reproach
but
the
workman
damaged
the
work
can
the
present
generation
have
become
so
fastidious
as
to
cease
to
feel
interest
in
what
is
great
and
beautiful
of
itself
and
to
need
all
the
refinements
of
style
in
order
to
revive
its
morbid
tastes
geneva
is
a
republic
and
this
perhaps
may
also
have
told
against
our
narrative
some
persons
have
fancied
that
when
the
author
spoke
of
liberty
he
meant
liberty
in
the
republican
form
alone
and
that
may
have
displeased
them
but
that
is
a
mistake
the
author
has
always
had
in
view
that
constitutional
liberty
which
includes
all
modern
liberties
and
not
any
particular
form
of
it
he
even
believes
that
the
monarchical
form
is
the
most
favourable
to
the
liberties
of
a
great
nation
it
has
been
his
lot
to
see
side
by
side
a
republic
without
liberty
and
a
monarchy
in
which
all
were
free
the
coldness
however
of
some
readers
for
the
annals
of
a
little
people
proceeds
in
the
main
from
another
cause
there
are
in
reality
two
histories
one
which
is
external
and
makes
much
noise
but
whose
consequences
are
not
lasting
the
other
which
is
internal
has
but
a
mean
appearance
like
the
seed
when
it
germinates
and
which
nevertheless
bears
most
precious
fruit
now
what
pleases
the
general
public
is
a
narrative
in
which
great
armies
manœuvre
while
on
the
other
hand
what
touches
the
author
is
the
movement
of
the
soul
of
strong
characters
enthusiastic
outbursts
the
low
estate
of
humble
and
tranquil
hearts
holy
affections
principles
the
faith
which
gains
victories
and
the
divine
life
which
regenerates
a
word
the
moral
world
the
material
world
physical
and
appreciable
forces
parks
of
artillery
and
glittering
squadrons
possess
but
a
secondary
interest
in
his
eyes
numerous
cannons
it
is
true
give
more
smoke
but
to
those
external
powers
which
destroy
life
he
prefers
the
internal
powers
which
elevate
the
soul
warm
it
for
truth
for
liberty
and
for
god
and
cause
it
to
be
born
again
to
life
everlasting
if
these
internal
forces
are
developed
in
the
midst
of
a
little
people
they
possess
all
the
more
attraction
for
him
if
humble
heroes
are
not
popular
shall
i
therefore
leave
their
noble
actions
in
obscurity
shall
i
limit
myself
henceforward
to
bringing
princes
and
kings
on
the
stage
with
statesmen
cardinals
armies
treaties
and
empires
no
i
can
not
do
so
i
shall
have
to
speak
indeed
of
francis
and
charles
of
anne
boleyn
and
henry
and
other
great
personages
but
i
shall
still
remain
faithful
to
little
people
and
little
things
it
is
indeed
a
petty
city
whose
struggles
i
am
relating
but
it
is
the
city
that
for
two
centuries
made
head
against
rome
until
she
had
resigned
the
task
entrusted
to
her
into
the
hands
of
more
powerful
germany
and
america
let
the
liberals
despise
her
who
at
this
very
time
most
enjoy
the
fruits
of
her
severe
struggles
be
it
so
as
for
me
i
have
not
the
courage
to
follow
them
i
call
to
mind
the
refugees
she
has
entertained
the
asylum
they
found
there
and
which
their
children
still
enjoy
and
i
desire
to
pay
my
debt
oh
if
she
would
only
understand
that
she
can
not
exist
with
honour
in
the
future
unless
while
loving
liberty
she
loves
the
gospel
more
than
everything
else
let
me
say
a
few
words
more
on
the
principles
which
have
guided
me
in
composing
this
history
what
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
study
above
all
things
is
in
my
opinion
the
beginnings
the
formation
of
beings
the
origin
of
the
successive
phases
of
humanity
possess
in
my
eyes
an
importance
and
interest
far
surpassing
the
exhibition
of
what
these
things
have
afterwards
become
the
creative
epoch
of
christianity
in
which
we
contemplate
christ
and
his
apostles
is
to
me
far
more
admirable
than
those
which
succeeded
it
similarly
the
reformation
which
is
the
creation
of
the
evangelical
world
in
modern
times
has
greater
attractions
for
me
than
the
protestantism
which
comes
after
i
take
a
pleasure
in
watching
life
in
its
commencement
when
the
work
is
done
its
are
over
in
the
first
lines
of
the
first
volume
of
my
first
work
i
said
that
i
should
follow
this
rule
i
shall
not
be
reproached
for
remaining
faithful
to
it
an
objection
has
been
raised
that
this
history
is
too
full
of
details
i
might
reply
that
it
is
not
good
to
leave
facts
in
vagueness
that
they
must
be
analysed
and
described
the
surrounding
circumstances
can
alone
give
an
accurate
knowledge
of
events
and
impress
on
them
the
stamp
of
reality
the
author
may
here
quote
an
authority
which
no
one
will
dispute
he
remembers
that
being
in
paris
at
guizot
just
as
the
first
volume
of
the
of
the
thirty
years
illustrious
writer

details
the
rest
we
know
we
do
not
think
that
many
of
our
readers
will
fancy
they
know
more
than
he
does
another
conviction
also
exercises
some
influence
on
the
character
of
my
narrative
it
seems
to
me
that
the
study
of
the
unknown
has
a
peculiar
charm
geneva
and
its
struggles
for
liberty
and
the
gospel
are
a
except
to
its
citizens
and
a
few
men
of
letters
when
historians
describe
ancient
or
modern
example
the
revolution
of
the
netherlands
of
england
or
of
france
can
only
say
a
little
better
what
others
have
already
said
before
them
perhaps
there
is
some
advantage
in
exploring
a
virgin
adding
new
facts
to
that
treasury
which
ought
to
be
the
wisdom
of
nations
the
author
is
not
however
blind
to
the
truth
there
may
have
been
in
some
of
the
criticisms
upon
his
while
following
the
principles
he
has
laid
down
he
will
endeavour
to
profit
by
them
he
had
hoped
to
publish
the
third
and
fourth
volumes
together
this
year
having
been
forced
to
pass
the
winter
of
at
nice
with
injunctions
to
abstain
from
work
he
publishes
one
only
now
but
the
next
god
willing
will
not
be
long
delayed
on
returning
from
nice
the
author
passed
through
piedmont
partly
to
be
present
at
a
synod
in
the
waldensian
valleys
which
reminded
him
of
the
one
described
in
this
volume
and
partly
to
make
researches
among
the
general
archives
of
the
kingdom
at
turin
the
valuable
collections
there
contained
were
liberally
thrown
open
to
him
and
he
was
able
to
select
and
transcribe
some
precious
documents
hitherto
unknown
of
which
as
will
be
seen
he
made
immediate
use
while
thanking
the
various
persons
who
have
been
useful
to
him
in
his
researches
the
author
desires
also
to
express
his
acknowledgments
to
the
translator
of
this
work
white
who
has
spared
no
pains
in
conveying
to
the
english
reader
a
faithful
and
animated
copy
of
the
original
the
translation
has
been
carefully
revised
by
the
author
with
great
care
line
by
line
and
word
by
word
and
some
changes
not
in
the
french
edition
have
been
introduced
will
this
work
obtain
a
success
similar
to
that
which
attended
the
former
one
that
treated
of
the
reformation
in
germany
with
luther
as
its
hero
this
treats
especially
of
the
reform
in
western
europe
with
calvin
as
its
head
the
scene
of
the
latter
being
nearer
home
ought
to
have
more
interest
for
british
readers
or
shall
a
passion
for
germany
and
the
germans
make
them
look
with
indifference
on
all
that
does
not
directly
concern
the
country
of
luther
france
holland
england
scotland
switzerland
should
possess
some
attraction
for
them
the
history
hitherto
almost
unknown
of
the
reformation
of
geneva
is
not
only
attractive
in
itself
it
is
also
of
importance
with
regard
to
england
geneva
is
the
representative
of
a
christian
system
of
a
great
doctrine
of
the
supreme
authority
of
holy
scripture
and
of
the
pure
gospel
the
final
triumph
of
this
doctrine
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
for
the
english
churches
a
british
theologian
of
our
day
has
said
systems
of
doctrine
are
now
and
probably
for
the
last
time
in
catholic
and
the
may
this
work
be
of
some
little
use

determining

broke

when
acts

terrible
cruelty

enthusiastically
applauded

strange
to

call
them
to
remembrance
though
it
be
with
sorrow
there
have
always
existed
many
generous
persons
in
the
bosom
of
catholicity
who
have
protested
with
horror
against
the
frightful
punishments
by
which
it
was
attempted
to
make
our
forefathers
renounce
their
faith
and
there
are
still
more
now
for
the
laws
of
religious
liberty
are
gradually
becoming
established
among
nations
but
we
must
never
forget
that
two
centuries
of
cruel
persecution
was
the
welcome
the
world
gave
to
the
reformation
when
the
day
of
bartholomew
saw
the
streets
of
the
capital
of
the
valois
run
with
blood
ruffians
glutted
their
savage
passions
on
the
corpse
of
that
best
and
greatest
of
frenchmen
was
the
enthusiasm
at
rome
and
a
fierce
shout
of
exultation
rang
through
the
pontifical
city
wishing
to
perpetuate
the
glory
of
the
massacre
of
the
huguenots
the
pope
ordered
a
medal
to
be
struck
representing
that
massacre
and
bearing
the
device
the
officers
of
the
roman
court
still
sell
as
we
know
personally
this
medal
to
all
who
desire
to
carry
away
some
remembrance
of
their
city
those
times
are
remote
milder
manners
prevail
but
it
is
the
duty
of
protestantism
to
remind
the
world
of
the
use
made
by
the
court
of
rome
on
emerging
from
the
middle
ages
of
that
in
catholic
countries
which
she
contends
belongs
to
her
always
and
which
she
is
still
ready
to
claim
the
greatest
vigour
resistance
to
this
cruel
cost
the
reformation
torrents
of
the
purest
blood
and
it
is
this
blood
which
gives
us
the
right
to
protest
against
it
before
we
describe
the
scenes
of
horror
that
defiled
the
streets
of
paris
at
this
period
we
must
follow
in
his
flight
that
young
doctor
who
though
illustrious
in
after
years
was
now
the
victim
of
persecution
the
feast
of
all
saints
being
the
day
when
the
university
celebrated
the
opening
of
the
academical
year
calvin
as
we
have
seen
through
the
channel
of
his
friend

rector
had
displayed
before
the
sorbonne
and
a
numerous
audience
the
great
principles
of
the
gospel

monks
priests
had
all
been
excited
scandalised
and
exasperated
parliament
had
interfered
and
cop
and
calvin
were
obliged
to
flee
that
man
whose
hand
was
one
day
boldly
to
raise
the
standard
of
the
gospel
in
the
world
whose
teaching
was
to
enlighten
many
nations
and
whose
eloquence
was
to
stir
all
france
that
man
who
was
yearly
to
send
forth
from
geneva
some
thirty
or
forty
missionaries
and
whose
letters
strengthened
all
the
churches
that
man
still
young
pursued
by
the
and
his
sergeants
had
been
forced
to
steal
out
of
his
chamber
into
the
street
and
disguise
himself
in
strange
garments
and
in
the
beginning
of
november
he
found
himself
in
the
back
streets
on
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
looking
on
every
side
lest
there
should
be
any
one
on
his
track
he
had
never
been
more
tranquil
than
at
the
moment
when
struck
by
this
sudden
blow
francis
resisted
the
insolence
of
the
monks
the
sorbonne
had
been
compelled
to
disavow
their
most
fanatical
acts
many
lutherans
were
able
to
preach
the
gospel
freely
to
those
around
them
a
reforming
movement
seemed
spreading
far
and
wide
through
france
when
suddenly
the
lightning
darted
forth
and
struck
the
young
reformer

i
should
be
able
to
devote
myself
to
god
service
without
hindrance
said
he
in
his
flight
promised
myself
a
tranquil
career
but
at
that
very
moment
what
i
expected
least
namely
persecution
and
exile
were
at
the
door
sidenote
calvin
flight
calvin
did
not
regret
however
the
testimony
he
had
borne
to
the
truth
and
resigned
himself
to
exile
far
from
resembling
the
unbroken
horse
to
use
his
own
expression
who
refuses
to
carry
his
rider
he
voluntarily
bowed
his
shoulders
to
the
cross
tire
in
the
middle
of
your
was
his
maxim
always
yet
as
he
travelled
along
those
rough
byroads
of
the
mantois
he
often
asked
himself
what
this
severe
dispensation
was
to
teach
him
was
he
to
retire
from
paris
and
renounce
the
idea
of
making
that
city
the
centre
of
his
christian
activity
that
would
indeed
be
a
hard
trial
for
him
his
people
seemed
to
be
waking
and
he
must
leave
them
still
he
kept
on
his
way
on
arriving
near
mantes
he
went
to
the
residence
of
the
sire
de
haseville
to
whom
he
was
known
and
there
remained
in
hiding
several
days
he
then
resumed
his
journey
either
because
he
thought
himself
too
near
his
enemies
or
because
his
host
was
afraid
calvin
took
the
road
to
the
south
he
crossed
the
charming
plains
and
valleys
of
touraine
entered
the
pasturages
and
forests
of
poitou
and
thence
turned
his
steps
towards
saintonge
and
the
angoumois
this
latter
province
was
the
end
of
his
journey
on
a
hill
at
whose
foot
the
charente
flowed
stood
the
cathedral
the
old
castle
and
city
of
angoulême
the
of
margaret
of
navarre
calvin
entered
the
gates
of
this
antique
town
and
made
his
way
to
one
of
the
principal
streets
which
afterwards
received
in
his
honour
the
name
it
still
de
in
that
street
was
a
large
mansion
whose
principal
apartment
was
a
long
gallery
in
which
more
than
four
thousand
volumes
printed
or
manuscript
were
collected
it
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
private
libraries
then
existing
in
france
the
fugitive
halted
before
this
house
learned
works
were
doubtless
well
calculated
to
attract
him
but
he
was
animated
by
another
motive
also
this
mansion
belonged
to
the
family
of
du
tillet
whose
members
were
reckoned
among
the
most
learned
in
the
kingdom
the
father
and
two
of
his
sons
were
detained
in
paris
by
their
duties
in
the
chamber
of
accounts
at
the
louvre
and
in
parliament
but
another
son
louis
canon
of
the
cathedral
was
at
angoulême
and
lived
alone
in
that
large
house
when
he
was
not
at
his
parish
of
claix
louis
was
calvin
friend
and
it
was
the
remembrance
of
this
gentle
mild
and
rather
weak
young
man
whose
disposition
was
very
engaging
that
had
induced
the
fugitive
to
bend
his
steps
towards
the
angoumois
sidenote
du
tillet
house
and
library
calvin
stopped
in
front
of
his
friend
house
and
knocked
at
the
door
it
opened
and
he
went
in
we
can
not
say
whether
he
found
the
canon
there
or
not
but
at
all
events
the
latter
was
filled
with
joy
when
he
heard
of
the
arrival
of
the
young
doctor
whose
gifts
and
he
admired
so
much
and
whose
intimacy
had
been
so
sweet
to
him
calvin
told
him
how
he
had
been
obliged
to
flee
from
the
attacks
of
the
parliament
and
of
the
danger
to
which
those
who
gave
him
refuge
were
exposed
but
du
tillet
thought
himself
the
happiest
of
men
if
he
could
but
shelter
his
friend
from
the
search
of
his
enemies
once
more
he
was
about
to
enjoy
those
spiritual
and
edifying
conversations
which
he
had
so
often
regretted
and
could
never
forget
even
the
persecution
of
which
calvin
was
a
victim
made
him
all
the
dearer
to
his
friend
and
louis
introduced
him
into
the
vast
gallery
installed
him
in
the
midst
of
the
most
eminent
minds
of
all
ages
whose
celebrated
works
loaded
the
numerous
shelves
and
established
him
as
in
a
safe
retreat
in
that
beautiful
library
which
seemed
prepared
for
the
lofty
intelligence
and
profound
studies
of
the
theologian
calvin
who
needed
retirement
and
repose
felt
happy
am
never
less
alone
than
when
alone
he
used
to
say
at
one
time
he
gave
thanks
to
god
at
another
taking
the
precious
volumes
from
the
shelves
around
him
he
opened
and
read
them
assuaging
the
thirst
for
knowledge
which
consumed
him
a
learned
retreat
like
that
now
given
him
was
the
dream
of
his
whole
life
pious
reflections
crowded
into
his
heart
and
if
during
his
flight
he
had
felt
a
momentary
darkness
the
light
now
shone
into
his
soul
causes
of
what
happens
to
us
are
often
so
hidden
he
said
in
after
times
human
affairs
seem
to
turn
about
at
random
as
on
a
wheel
and
the
flesh
tempts
us
to
murmur
against
god
because
he
sports
with
men
tossing
them
here
and
there
like
balls
but
the
issue
shows
us
that
god
is
on
the
watch
for
the
salvation
of
believers
sidenote
doxopolis
a
new
epoch
a
new
phase
was
beginning
for
calvin
he
was
leaving
school
he
was
about
to
enter
upon
life
and
a
pause
was
necessary
the
future
reformer
before
rushing
into
the
storms
of
an
agitated
career
was
to
be
tempered
anew
in
the
fire
of
the
divine
word
and
of
prayer
great
struggles
awaited
him
the
church
was
waking
up
from
the
slumber
of
death
throwing
back
the
of
popery
and
rising
from
the
sepulchre
one
universal
cry
was
heard
among
all
the
nations
of
the
west
at
worms
a
monk
had
demanded
the
holy
scriptures
of
god
in
presence
of
the
imperial
diet
a
priest
had
demanded
them
at
zurich
students
had
demanded
them
at
cambridge
at
spire
an
assembly
of
princes
had
declared
that
they
would
hear
nothing
but
the
preaching
of
that
heavenly
word
and
its
doctrines
had
been
solemnly
confessed
at
augsburg
in
the
presence
of
charles
germany
switzerland
england
the
low
countries
europe
in
a
word
was
stirred
at
the
sight
of
that
new
faith
which
had
come
forth
from
the
tomb
of
ages
france
herself
was
moved
how
could
a
young
man
so
modest
so
timid
who
feared
so
much
all
contact
with
the
passions
of
could
calvin
battle
for
the
faith
if
he
did
not
receive
in
the
retirement
of
the
wilderness
the
baptism
of
the
spirit
and
of
fire
and
this
baptism
he
received
alone
and
forced
to
hide
himself
he
experienced
an
inward
peace
and
joy
he
had
never
known
before
the
exercise
of
the
cross
he
said
son
of
god
receives
us
his
and
makes
us
partakers
of
his
glory
accordingly
he
gave
a
very
extraordinary
name
to
the
obscure
town
of
angoulême
he
called
it
the
city
of
glory
and
thus
he
dated
his
letters
how
pleasant
and
glorious
this
retirement
proved
to
him
he
had
found
his
wartburg
his
and
unable
any
longer
to
hide
from
his
friends
the
happiness
he
enjoyed
he
wrote
to
francis
daniel
of
orleans
can
not
i
have
a
moment
talk
with
you
he
said
indeed
to
trouble
you
with
my
disputes
and
struggles
why
should
i
do
so
i
think
that
what
interests
you
more
just
now
is
to
know
that
i
am
well
and
that
if
you
take
into
account
my
known
i
am
making
progress
in
my
studies
then
after
speaking
of
du
tillet
kindness
of
his
own
responsibility
and
of
the
use
he
ought
to
make
of
his
leisure
the
joy
which
filled
his
heart
ran
over
and
he
exclaimed
with
thankfulness
how
happy
i
should
think
myself
if
the
peace
which
i
now
enjoy
should
continue
during
the
time
of
my
retirement
and
exile
the
lord
whose
providence
foresees
everything
will
provide
experience
has
taught
me
that
we
can
not
see
much
beforehand
what
will
happen
to
us
at
the
very
moment
when
i
promised
myself
repose
the
storm
burst
suddenly
upon
me
and
then
when
i
thought
some
horrible
den
would
be
my
lot
a
quiet
was
unexpectedly
prepared
for
it
is
the
hand
of
god
that
hath
done
this
only
let
us
trust
in
him
and
he
will
care
for
us
thus
the
hunted
calvin
found
himself
at
angoulême
under
hand
like
a
young
bird
that
has
taken
refuge
in
the
nest
under
the
wing
of
its
mother
sidenote
calvin
labours
the
young
canon
took
the
liveliest
interest
in
the
fate
of
his
guest
and
hoped
to
see
the
hospitality
he
showed
him
bear
precious
fruits
for
learning
and
the
gospel
calvin
too
humble
to
believe
that
du
cares
had
any
reference
to
himself
ascribed
them
solely
to
his
zeal
for
knowledge
and
the
cause
of
christ
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
never
repay
such
kindness
but
by
constant
labour
and
that
was
all
he
ever
had
to
give
protector
kindness
he
said
sufficient
to
stimulate
the
indolence
of
the
laziest
of
men
cheer
up
then
let
me
make
an
effort
let
me
struggle
earnestly
no
more
carelessness
then
he
shut
himself
up
in
du
tillet
library
gathered
round
him
the
books
he
wanted
and
said
must
give
all
my
attention
to
study
this
thought
is
constantly
pulling
me
by
the
ear
if
he
took
a
moment
leisure
he
felt
ear
pulled
that
is
to
say
his
conscience
was
troubled
he
hurried
to
his
books
and
set
to
work
with
so
much
zeal
he
passed
whole
nights
without
sleeping
and
days
without
eating
this
was
his
a
great
idea
was
at
that
time
growing
in
his
heart
parliament
accused
and
even
burnt
his
brethren
for
pretended
heresies
i
be
silent
he
said
thus
give
unbelievers
an
opportunity
of
condemning
a
doctrine
they
do
not
know
why
should
not
the
reformed
have
a
confession
to
lay
before
their
adversaries
as
he
examined
du
library
he
came
upon
certain
books
which
seemed
to
him
to
bear
particularly
on
the
existing
state
of
suffering
among
evangelical
christians
he
saw
that
apologies
had
formerly
been
presented
to
the
emperor
adrian
by
quadratus
and
aristides
to
antoninus
by
justin
martyr
and
to
marcus
aurelius
by
athenagoras
ought
not
the
friends
of
the
reformation
to
present
a
similar
defence
to
francis
if
mouth
is
shut
he
will
take
up
the
pen
god
was
then
setting
him
apart
for
one
of
the
great
works
of
the
age
he
did
not
indeed
compose
his
at
this
time
even
under
the
elementary
form
of
the
first
edition
but
he
meditated
it
he
searched
the
scriptures
he
drew
out
the
sketch
and
perhaps
wrote
some
passages
of
that
work
the
finest
produced
by
the
reformation
and
hence
one
of
the
enemies
of
the
reform
casting
a
severe
look
on
the
learned
library
of
the
du
tillets
was
led
to
exclaim
is
the
forge
where
the
new
prepared
the
bolts
that
he
was
afterwards
to
scatter
on
every
side
that
is
the
factory
where
he
began
to
make
the
nets
that
he
afterwards
fixed
up
to
catch
the
simple
and
from
which
a
man
must
be
very
clever
to
get
out
it
was
there
that
he
wove
the
web
of
his
which
we
may
call
the
or
the
of
heresy
sidenote
materialists
while
calvin
was
writing
his
first
notes
he
heard
some
strange
rumours
men
spoke
to
him
of
certain
materialists
in
whose
opinion
the
soul
died
with
the
body
at
first
he
hesitated
as
to
what
he
should
do
he
asked
i
join
battle
with
adversaries
of
whose
camp
and
arms
and
tactics
i
know
nothing
and
of
whom
i
have
only
heard
some
confused
murmur
another
consideration
checked
him
allied
to
them
were
christians
who
while
rejecting
these
errors
said
that
did
not
exist
for
the
soul
separated
from
the
body
and
that
the
moment
of
death
was
followed
instantly
by
the
moment
of
resurrection
should
not
like
these
good
people
to
be
offended
against
me
he
said
calvin
refused
to
fire
a
shot
against
his
enemies
lest
he
should
wound
his
brethren
but
one
day
he
was
told
of
enormous
and
degrading
sophisms
these
teachers
said
to
their
followers
has
not
placed
in
man
a
soul
different
from
that
of
the
beast
the
soul
is
not
a
substance
it
is
only
a
quality
of
life
which
proceeds
from
the
throbbing
of
the
arteries
or
the
motion
of
the
lungs
it
can
not
exist
without
the
body
and
perishes
with
it
until
man
rises
again
whole
calvin
was
thunderstruck
to
be
a
man
and
to
rank
yourself
among
beasts
seemed
to
him
foolish
and
impious
god
he
exclaimed
conflagration
has
increased
and
thrown
out
flakes
which
spreading
far
and
wide
have
turned
to
burning
torches
o
lord
extinguish
them
we
pray
thee
by
that
saving
rain
which
thou
reservest
for
thy
church
it
was
this
gross
materialism
which
absorbed
calvin
attention
at
angoulême
he
saw
the
evil
which
these
teachers
might
do
the
reform
and
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
dangers
which
threatened
the
simple
reeds
tossed
by
every
wind
he
exclaimed
the
slightest
breath
shakes
and
bends
what
will
become
of
you
then
addressing
the
materialists
he
said
the
lord
says
that
the
wicked
kill
the
body
but
kill
the
does
he
not
mean
that
the
soul
survives
after
death
know
you
not
that
according
to
scripture
the
souls
of
the
saints
stand
before
the
throne
of
god
and
that
white
robes
were
given
unto
every
one
of
them
then
resorting
to
irony
he
continued
souls
what
i
pray
do
you
understand
by
these
do
you
take
them
for
on
which
the
souls
recline
that
are
condemned
to
die
this
mode
of
arguing
was
not
rare
in
the
sixteenth
century
calvin
agitated
by
these
errors
took
up
his
pen
and
committed
to
paper
the
reflections
which
he
published
shortly
after
calvin
loved
to
repose
from
these
struggles
on
the
bosom
of
friendship
in
the
society
of
du
tillet
at
angoulême
he
found
once
more
the
charms
which
that
of
duchemin
had
procured
for
him
at
orleans
all
his
life
he
sought
that
noble
intercourse
those
those
kindnesses
which
friendship
procures
even
when
deep
in
study
he
loved
to
see
the
library
door
open
a
face
appear
and
a
friend
sit
down
by
his
side
their
conversations
had
an
inexpressible
sweetness
for
him
have
no
need
said
the
young
canon
those
secrets
which
pythagoras
employed
to
produce
an
indissoluble
friendship
between

december
and
january
by
degrees
however
calvin
came
out
of
his
retirement
shut
up
in
his
library
he
began
to
sigh
for
country
air
like
luther
in
the
wartburg
he
went
out
sometimes
alone
or
with
his
friend
and
rambled
over
the
hills
and
quiet
meadows
watered
by
the
charente
the
neighbourhood
of
angoulême
did
not
present
the
grandeur
he
was
one
day
to
find
on
the
shores
of
the
leman
but
to
him
everything
in
creation
was
beautiful
because
he
saw
the
creator
everywhere
he
could
even
be
profoundly
touched
by
the
beauties
of
nature
the
presence
of
the
works
of
god
he
said
are
overcome
with
astonishment
and
our
tongues
and
senses
fail
us
not
far
from
the
city
was
a
vineyard
belonging
to
the
canon
to
which
du
tillet
one
day
conducted
his
friend
the
delighted
calvin
returned
there
frequently
the
remembrance
of
these
visits
still
lingers
in
those
parts
and
the
vineyard
still
goes
by
the
name
of
about
this
time
their
circle
was
increased
john
du
tillet
afterwards
bishop
of
meaux
arrived
at
angoulême
he
too
became
attached
with
his
whole
heart
to
calvin
the
latter
wishing
to
make
himself
useful
to
the
two
brothers
offered
to
teach
them
greek
and
while
teaching
them
to
read
the
new
testament
he
led
them
to
seek
christ
john
listened
greedily
to
the
young
doctor
words
hence
he
was
long
suspected
by
the
romanists
and
having
published
in
a
very
old
manuscript
ascribed
to
charlemagne
are
known
to
be
opposed
to
occasioned
loud
murmurs
man

the
famous
cardinal
du

not

other
opinion
sidenote
calvin
at
claix
these
lessons
begun
at
angoulême
were
continued
at
claix
where
du
tillet
used
to
spend
a
part
of
the
year
people
asked
in
the
village
who
that
short
thin
pale
young
man
was
who
looked
so
serious
and
meek
and
whom
they
often
met
with
the
du
tillets
the
best
informed
said
that
he
gave
them
lessons
in
greek
this
study
was
a
thing
so
extraordinary
in
the
angoumois
that
the
country
people
ignorant
of
the
name
called
him
the
of
or
the
some
of
the
better
people
of
the
neighbourhood
of
claix
occasionally
met
the
friends
they
entered
into
conversation
and
says
a
contemporary
who
loved
learning
esteemed
the
young
scholar
his
knowledge
of
the
classics
his
taste
so
fine
and
accurate
attracted
them
to
him
certain
friends
of
the
du
tillets
ecclesiastics
of
good
family
men
of
letters
and
of
feeling
soon
shared
this
admiration
of
his
virtues
and
his
talents
they
were
anthony
de
chaillou
prior
of
bouteville
the
abbot
of
balsac
near
jarnac
the
famous
de
la
place
the
sieur
de
torsac
charles
girault
and
others
calvin
appearance
his
simple
dress
and
modest
look
interested
these
good
men
at
first
sight
and
that
clear
and
penetrating
glance
which
he
preserved
until
the
last
soon
revealed
to
them
the
keen
intelligence
and
uprightness
of
the
young
they
conceived
the
most
hearty
affection
for
him
they
loved
to
hear
him
speak
of
the
saviour
and
of
heaven
and
yielded
to
his
evangelical
teaching
without
a
thought
of
being
faithless
to
that
of
the
church
this
was
the
case
with
many
catholics
at
that
time
they
did
not
find
in
calvin
the
things
that
make
fine
talkers
in
the
merry
jests
bantering
jokes
and
all
sorts
of
foolery
which
pass
away
in
smoke
but
the
charms
and
profitableness
of
his
conversation
captivated
all
who
heard
him
de
la
place
in
particular
received
a
deep
impression
shall
never
forget
he
wrote
years
after
your
conversation
made
me
better
when
we
were
together
at
angoulême
oh
what
shall
i
give
you
in
this
mortal
life
for
the
immortal
life
that
i
then
received
sidenote
calvin
friends
the
frequent
visits
paid
to
the
by
persons
of
consideration
were
soon
remarked
by
the
clergy
on
the
other
hand
bouteville
desired
to
substitute
more
regular
conferences
for
these
simple
conversations
he
lived
at
the
castle
of
gérac
situated
in
a
less
frequented
district
to
my
house
he
said
to
his
friends
let
each
of
us
state
freely
his
convictions
and
objections
calvin
hesitated
about
going
was
fond
of
solitude
and
spoke
little
in
company
but
the
thought
of
bringing
his
friends
to
the
gospel
decided
him
sidenote
conferences
at
gérac
one
day
therefore
the
modest
doctor
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
prior
of
bouteville
guests
one
idea
had
absorbed
him
on
the
road
to
gérac
he
thought
that
is
not
a
common
thing
that
it
rises
far
above
the
capacity
of
the
human
understanding
and
that
we
ought
to
purchase
it
at
any
price
at
last
when
he
joined
his
friends
after
mutual
greetings
had
been
exchanged
he
spoke
to
them
of
the
subject
that
filled
his
heart
he
opened
the
bible
placed
his
hand
on
it
and
said
us
find
the
truth
whole
conference
says
florimond
rémond
a
staunch
catholic
no
other
object
but
investigation
of
a
phrase
which
he
had
generally
in
his
mouth
calvin
however
did
not
set
himself
up
as
an
oracle
addressing
the
conscience
he
showed
that
christ
answered
all
the
wants
of
the
soul
the
conversation
soon
became
animated
his
friends
bringing
forward
objections
he
never
was
at
a
loss
a
marvellous
facility
they
said
penetrating
suddenly
the
greatest
difficulties
and
clearing
them
up
the
visitors
of
gérac
departed
joyfully
to
their
homes
after
these
conferences
calvin
returned
quietly
to
his
retreat
and
prayed
for
those
to
whom
he
had
spoken
and
for
others
besides
sometimes
we
are
cold
in
prayer
he
said
us
at
once
remember
how
many
of
our
brethren
are
sinking
under
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
troubles
how
many
are
oppressed
by
great
anguish
in
their
hearts
and
in
all
extremity
of
evils
we
must
have
hearts
of
iron
or
steel
if
such
sluggishness
in
prayer
can
not
then
be
expelled
from
our
bosoms
calvin
felt
the
necessity
of
giving
a
solid
foundation
to
the
faith
of
his
friends
tree
that
is
not
deeply
rooted
he
said
easily
torn
up
by
the
first
blast
of
the
storm
he
then
committed
to
paper
as
we
have
said
the
first
ideas
of
his
one
day
as
he
was
starting
for
gérac
he
took
his
notes
with
him
and
read
what
he
had
just
written
to
the
circle
assembled
in
the
castle
he
did
this
several
times
afterwards
but
the
notes
served
merely
as
a
text
on
which
he
commented
with
much
eloquence
one
can
equal
him
they
said
loftiness
of
language
conciseness
of
arrangement
and
majesty
of
style
he
was
not
content
with
stating
this
doctrine
or
that
his
fine
understanding
grasped
the
organic
unity
of
the
christian
truths
and
he
was
able
to
present
them
as
a
divine
whole
it
was
no
doubt
the
cry
of
his
conscience
which
had
led
him
to
seek
salvation
in
the
holy
scriptures
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
study
compare
and
fathom
them
without
his
understanding
becoming
enlightened
developed
and
sanctified
the
moral
faculty
is
that
which
is
first
aroused
in
the
christian
but
it
immediately
provokes
the
exercise
of
the
intellectual
faculties
the
citizens
of
the
kingdom
of
god
are
not
those
who
know
but
those
who
believe
not
the
learned
but
the
regenerated
a
church
in
which
the
intellectual
faculty
is
above
the
moral
faculty
does
not
bear
the
stamp
of
the
protestant
and
christian
principle
but
every
church
in
which
the
divine
faculty
of
the
understanding
is
neglected
and
where
learning
is
viewed
with
distrust
will
easily
fall
into
deplorable
error
calvin
explanations
so
deep
and
yet
so
clear
were
not
without
their
use
du
tillet
chaillou
de
la
place
torsac
and
others
mutually
expressed
their
admiration
and
joy
after
the
young
doctor
had
retired
then
at
their
homes
and
apart
from
the
world
they
meditated
on
the
consoling
truths
they
had
heard
many
of
the
most
notable
men
of
the
district
were
won
over
to
evangelical
convictions
the
prior
of
bouteville
in
particular
showed
from
that
time
so
much
faith
and
was
after
calvin
departure
so
much
the
father
and
guide
of
those
who
had
received
the
seed
of
truth
that
he
was
called
throughout
the
province
lutherans
pope
calvin
sphere
widened
gradually
he
wrote
to
those
to
whom
he
could
not
speak
and
ere
long
his
friends
asked
why
they
should
keep
for
themselves
alone
the
bread
of
life
on
which
they
fed
one
of
them
giving
utterance
to
this
thought
to
the
young
doctor
added
you
can
only
reach
the
people
in
the
churches
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
calvin
a
fugitive
from
paris
could
visit
the
churches
of
the
angoumois
as
an
evangelical
missionary
some
short
christian
exhortations
for
us
said
his
friends
to
him
we
will
give
them
to
parish
priests
to
read
to
their
congregations
he
did
so
and
humble
clerks
read
these
evangelical
appeals
from
their
pulpits
as
well
as
they
could
thus
calvin
preached
through
the
mouths
of
priests
to
poor
villagers
as
he
had
addressed
the
imposing
sorbonne
by
the
mouth
of
the
rector
sidenote
calvin
provides
sermons
this
encouraged
certain
church
dignitaries
especially
the
prior
who
were
at
once
his
disciples
and
his
patrons
if
calvin
could
not
preach
in
french
why
should
he
not
teach
in
latin
they
surrounded
the
young
doctor
representing
to
him
that
latin
the
language
of
the
roman
church
could
not
occasion
any
scandal
and
asked
him
to
deliver
some
latin
orations
before
the
clergy
calvin
firmly
convinced
that
the
reform
ought
to
begin
with
the
teaching
of
the
priest
preached
several
latin
sermons
in
peter
church
in
this
way
he
inaugurated
his
career
as
a
reformer
all
this
could
not
be
done
without
giving
rise
to
murmurs
the
faithful
followers
of
rome
complained
of
him
of
the
prior
of
all
his
friends
and
this
opposition
might
become
dangerous
instrument
says
a
romanist
with
reference

calvin

the

destined
to
reduce
france
to
greater
extremities
than
the

the

the

the

had
done
he
was
not

evangelical
christians
of
other
countries
some
of
whom
were
ministers
had
taken
refuge
there
and
and
villages
were
suddenly
by
hearing
a
single
sermon
says
a
roman
catholic
historian
on
certain
days
the
simple
peasants
and
even
a
few
townspeople
arriving
by
different
paths
would
meet
in
a
retired
spot
in
the
bed
of
some
torrent
or
in
a
cavern
of
the
mountain
they
had
often
to
wait
a
long
time
for
the
preacher
the
priests
and
their
creatures
forced
him
to
make
a
wide
circuit
sometimes
he
did
not
come
at
all
says
a
catholic
might
be
seen
trampling
on
the
modesty
of
their
sex
taking
a
bible
reading
it
and
even
assuming
the
boldness
to
interpret
it
while
waiting
for
the
minister
at
this
epoch
the
queen
of
navarre
arrived
in
the
south
the
noise
caused
in
by
the

calvin

had
induced
her
to
quit

her

her

the
somewhat
gloomy

oppressive

not
much
to
the
taste
of
the
lively

therefore
started
for

two
litters
with
six
mules
three

mules
and
three
or
four
carriages
for
the

entered
the
city
and
took
the
road
that
leads
to
the
vast
gothic
castle
of
the
it
was
a
very
scanty
retinue
for
the
sister
of
francis
i
sidenote
queen
margaret
at
nérac
margaret
alighted
from
her
litter
and
was
hardly
settled
in
her
apartments
before
she
felt
quite
happy
for
she
had
escaped
at
last
from
the
pomps
and
struggles
of
the
court
of
france
she
laid
aside
her
showy
dresses
and
her
grand
manners
she
hid
the
majesty
of
her
house
beneath
a
candour
and
friendliness
that
enchanted
all
who
came
near
her
dressed
like
a
plain
gentlewoman
she
quitted
the
castle
crossed
the
baise
which
flows
through
the
city
and
rambled
along
the
beautiful
walks
of
the
neighbourhood
having
for
companions
only
the
seneschaless
of
poitou
or
one
of
her
young
ladies
of
honour
but
she
had
come
for
something
more
than
this
having
fled
far
from
the
palaces
and
cities
where
the
persecuting
spirit
of
rome
and
of
the
parliament
was
raging
she
occupied
herself
more
particularly
in
giving
a
fresh
impulse
to
the
evangelical
movement
in
the
southern
provinces
her
activity
was
inexhaustible
she
sent
out
who
made
their
way
into
houses
and
while
selling
jewellery
to
the
young
women
presented
them
also
with
new
testaments
printed
in
fine
characters
ruled
in
red
and
bound
in
vellum
with
gilt
edges
mere
sight
of
these
books
says
an
historian
a
desire
to
read
them
around
the
queen
everybody
was
in
motion
labouring
and
murmuring
like
a
hive
of
bees
says
the
king
historiographer
the
precious
flower
that
adorned
this
parterre
and
whose
perfume
attracted
the
best
spirits
of
europe
to
bearn
as
thyme

the
queen
might
often
be
seen
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
sufferers
to
whom
she
showed
the
tenderest
respect
these
were
the
refugees
lefèvre
of
etaples
gerard
roussel
converted
priests
and
monks
and
a
number
of
laymen
obliged
to
leave
france
which
they
had
been
able
to
do
thanks
to
the
queen
who
had
assisted
their
flight
good
princess
said
a
catholic
really
nothing
more
at
heart
than
to
get
those
out
of
the
way
whom
the
king
wishes
to
deliver
up
to
the
severities
of
justice
if
i
attempted
to
give
the
names
of
all
those
whom
she
has
saved
from
punishment
i
should
never
finish
the
christians
exiled
for
the
gospel
did
not
make
her
forget
the
wretched
of
her
own
country
one
day
when
roussel
was
describing
to
her
the
unfortunate
situation
of
a
poor
family
margaret
said
nothing
but
returning
to
her
chamber
she
threw
a
bearnese
hood
over
her
shoulders
and
followed
by
a
single
domestic
went
out
by
a
private
door
hastened
to
the
sufferers
and
comforted
them
with
the
tenderest
affection
she
took
pleasure
in
founding
schools
roussel
her
chaplain
would
visit
the
humble
room
in
which
the
children
of
the
people
were
learning
to
read
and
write
and
going
up
to
them
would
say
dear
children
the
death
of
christ
is
a
real
atonement
there
is
no
sin
so
small
as
not
to
need
it
or
so
great
that
it
can
not
be
blotted
out
by
it
praying
to
god
he
would
add
not
muttering
with
the
lips
prayer
is
an
ardent
and
serious
converse
with
the
lord
sidenote
calvin
and
roussel
there
was
one
feature
however
in
this
awakening
in
the
south
which
in
calvin
eyes
rendered
it
imperfect
and
transitory
unless
some
remedy
were
applied
to
it
there
was
in
it
a
certain
halting
between
truth
and
error
the
pious
but
weak
roussel
manifested
a
lamentable
spirit
of
compromise
in
his
teaching
wearied
with
the
struggles
he
had
gone
through
he
sheltered
himself
under
the
cloak
of
the
catholic
church
he
did
not
pray
to
the
virgin
he
administered
the
holy
sacrament
in
two
kinds
but
he
celebrated
a
kind
of
mournful
and
yet
touching
instance
of
that
mixed
christianity
which
aimed
at
preserving
evangelical
life
under
catholic
forms
calvin
at
angoulême
was
not
far
from
nérac
and
his
eyes
were
often
turned
to
that
city
he
longed
to
see
lefèvre
before
the
old
man
was
taken
from
the
world
and
was
uneasy
about
roussel
whom
he
feared
to
see
yielding
to
the
seductions
of
greatness
one
of
the
christian
thoughts
that
had
laid
the
strongest
hold
on
his
mind
was
the
conviction
that
the
wisdom
from
on
high
ought
to
reject
every
compromise
suggested
by
ambition
or
hypocrisy
ought
he
not
to
try
and
bring
back
roussel
into
the
right
path
from
which
he
appeared
to
be
wandering
calvin
left
du
tillet
house
probably
about
the
end
of
february
and
called
upon
roussel
as
soon
as
he
arrived
at
nérac
the
most
decided
and
the
most
moderate
of
the
theologians
of
the
sixteenth
century
were
now
face
to
face
calvin
naturally
timid
and
hesitating
never
have
had
the
boldness
so
much
as
to
open
his
mouth
to
use
his
own
words
but
faith
in
christ
begot
such
a
strong
assurance
in
his
heart
that
he
could
not
remain
silent
he
therefore
gave
his
opinion
with
decision
is
no
good
left
in
catholicism
he
said
must
the
church
in
its
ancient
purity
is
that
you
say
answered
the
astonished
roussel
house
ought
to
be
purified
no
doubt
but
not
destroyed
said
the
young
reformer
edifice
is
so
bad
that
it
can
not
be
repaired
we
must
pull
it
down
entirely
and
build
another
in
its
place
exclaimed
with
alarm
must
cleanse
the
church
but
not
by
setting
it
on
fire
if
we
take
upon
ourselves
to
pull
it
down
we
shall
be
crushed
under
the
ruins
calvin
retired
in
sorrow
type
of
protestant
decision
in
the
sixteenth
century
he
always
protested
freely
and
boldly
against
everything
that
was
contrary
to
the
gospel
he
displayed
this
unshakeable
firmness
not
only
in
opposition
to
catholic
tendencies
but
also
against
rationalistic
ideas
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
in
zwingle
in
melanchthon
and
even
in
luther
some
sprinkling
of
neology
of
which
the
slightest
traces
can
not
be
found
in
calvin
sidenote
calvin
and
lefèvre
nérac
as
we
have
said
sheltered
another
old
man
whom
age
might
have
made
weaker
than
roussel
but
who
under
his
white
hair
and
decrepid
appearance
concealed
a
living
force
to
be
suddenly
revived
by
contact
with
the
great
faith
of
the
young
scholar
calvin
asked
for
lefèvre
house
everybody
knew
him
is
a
little
bit
of
a
man
old
as
herod
but
lively
as
gunpowder
they
told
him
as
we
have
seen
lefèvre
had
professed
the
great
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
even
before
luther
but
after
so
many
years
the
aged
doctor
still
indulged
in
the
vain
hope
of
seeing
catholicism
reform
itself
ought
to
be
only
one
church
he
would
frequently
repeat
and
this
idea
prevented
his
separation
from
rome
nevertheless
his
spiritualist
views
permitted
him
to
preserve
the
unity
of
charity
with
all
who
loved
christ
when
calvin
was
admitted
into
his
presence
he
discerned
the
great
man
under
his
puny
stature
and
was
caught
by
the
charm
which
he
exercised
over
all
who
came
near
him
what
mildness
what
depth
what
knowledge
modesty
candour
loftiness
piety
moral
grandeur
and
holiness
had
been
said
of
him
it
seemed
as
if
all
these
virtues
illuminated
the
old
man
with
heavenly
brightness
just
as
the
night
of
the
grave
was
about
to
cover
him
with
its
darkness
on
his
side
the
young
man
pleased
lefèvre
who
began
to
tell
him
how
the
opposition
of
the
sorbonne
had
compelled
him
to
take
refuge
in
the
south
order
as
he
said
escape
the
bloody
hands
of
those
doctors
calvin
endeavoured
to
remove
the
old
man
illusions
he
showed
him
that
we
must
receive
everything
from
the
word
and
from
the
grace
of
god
he
spoke
with
clearness
with
decision
and
with
energy
lefèvre
was
reflected
a
little
and
weeping
exclaimed
i
know
the
truth
but
i
keep
myself
apart
from
those
who
profess
it
recovering
however
from
his
trouble
he
wiped
his
eyes
and
seeing
his
young
all
the
fetters
of
this
world
and
preparing
to
fight
under
the
banner
of
jesus
he
examined
him
more
attentively
and
asked
himself
if
he
had
not
before
him
that
future
reformer
whom
he
had
once
foretold
man
he
said
will
be
one
day
a
powerful
instrument
in
the
lord
the
world
will
obstinately
resist
jesus
christ
and
everything
will
seem
to
conspire
against
the
son
of
god
but
stand
firm
on
that
rock
and
many
will
be
broken
against
it
god
will
make
use
of
you
to
restore
the
kingdom
of
heaven
in
france
in
luther
being
of
the
same
age
as
calvin
in
heard
a
similar
prophecy
from
the
mouth
of
a
venerable
doctor
yet
if
we
may
believe
a
catholic
historian
the
old
man
did
not
stop
there
his
eyes
resting
with
kindness
on
the
young
man
expressed
a
certain
fear
he
fancied
he
saw
a
young
horse
which
however
admirable
its
spirit
might
dash
beyond
all
restraint
on
your
guard
he
added
the
extreme
ardour
of
your
mind
take
melanchthon
as
your
pattern
and
let
your
strength
be
always
tempered
with
charity
the
old
man
pressed
the
young
man
hand
and
they
parted
never
to
see
each
other
again
did
calvin
see
the
queen
of
navarre
also
it
does
not
appear
that
margaret
was
living
at
nérac
at
that
time
but
he
had
some
relations
with
her
it
has
been
said
that
she
felt
an
interest
in
his
exile
and
it
is
possible
that
she
had
some
share
in
the
resolution
he
soon
formed
of
quitting
the
south
she
may
have
assured
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
in
paris
if
he
committed
no
imprudence
but
we
have
found
nothing

these
points

to
du

the
visits
made
to
roussel
and
lefèvre
had
taught
him
a
lesson
he
comprehended
that
it
was
not
only
souls
blindly
submissive
to
rome
that
incurred
imminent
danger
he
conceived
the
liveliest
alarm
for
those
minds
which
floated
between
the
pope
and
the
word
of
god
either
through
weakness
or
want
of
light

that

two

of
those
who

lingering
beneath

beneath

because
of
their
evangelical
truths
charmed

as
they
belong
to
the
religious
history
of
the
epoch
we
can
not
pass
them
by
unnoticed
margaret
fitted
up
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
as
a
theatre
the
scenery
was
prepared
and
shortly
after
christmas
placards
announced
the
representation
of
nativity
of
jesus
christ
when
the
day
came
the
hall
was
crowded
in
the
front
rank
of
the
amphitheatre
sat
the
king
and
queen
the
latter
wearing
a
plain
dress
trimmed
with
marten
fur
and
a
bearnese
hood
near
them
were
the
cardinals
de
grammont
and
de
foix
with
other
members
of
the
clergy
around
the
royal
pair
were

maids
her
seventeen
secretaries
and
her
twenty
were
most
of
them
present
the
invited
strangers
occupied
seats
according
to
their
rank
a
first
representation
has
rarely
excited
more
curiosity
sidenote
the
the
first
act
begins
the
scene
is
placed
at
nazareth
in
the
house
of
a
poor
carpenter
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
and
a
young
woman
are
talking
together
a
proclamation
has
just
been
published
in
the
ordering
every
one
to
go
to
the
city
of
their
family
to
be
registered
but
these
poor
people
belong
to
bethlehem
and
bethlehem
is
a
long
way
from
nazareth
the
woman
is
soon
to
become
a
mother
and
the
man
is
uneasy
about
the
consequences
of
the
journey
the
young
israelitish
woman
whose
calm
meek
features
indicate
the
serenity
of
a
pious
soul
says
to
him
us
no
danger
shall
come
nigh
for
he
whose
power
me
holds
in
his
hand
both
fruit
and
tree
the
scene
changes
and
we
are
at
bethlehem
it
is
quite
dark
but
a
few
lights
are
visible
through
the
windows
of
the
houses
the
same
man
and
are
joseph
and
just
arrived
from
nazareth
after
a
fatiguing
journey
joseph
still
anxious
begins
it
is
late
and
already
night
let
us
approach
the
nearest
light
he
knocks
at
the
door
and
asks
to
be
admitted
the
owner
of
the
house
looks
contemptuously
on
them
and
says
that
he
lodges
none
but
rich
people
joseph
goes
a
little
farther
on
and
knocks
at
another
door
will
you
please
lodge
my
wife
and
me
for
the
poor
woman
as
you
see
is
near
her
time
this
man
looks
as
contemptuously
upon
them
as
the
other
and
answers
that
he
takes
in
none
but
noblemen
joseph
still
undiscouraged
points
out
a
third
man
to
his
wife
and
says
here
is
a
man
with
pleasant
look
he
speaks
to
him
but
the
man
is
a
and
is
annoyed
by
the
appearance
of
the
travellers
like
he
says
dances
sports
women
no
are
wanted
here
pass
on
my
friends
joseph
with
a
deep
sigh
onward
then
and
god
will
tell
where
he
pleases
we
should
dwell
but
wearied
by
the
journey
and
uneasy
about
her
condition
mary
begins
to
change
countenance
woe
me
i
feel
the
hour
draw
near
for
the
fruit
at
these
words
the
startled
joseph
looks
round
him
and
discovering
at
last
a
poor
stable
which
the
wind
penetrates
on
every
side
he
presses
mary
to
enter
it
i
will
take
care
to
shelter
you
from
every
hurtful
air
he
settles
the
young
woman
as
comfortably
as
he
can
in
the
rude
shed
and
prepares
to
go
into
the
town
to
get
what
she
requires
mary
go
go
my
friend
i
shall
not
be
alone
for
where
god
is
there
also
is
my
home
mary
remaining
alone
offers
up
a
touching
prayer
to
her
heavenly
father
then
yielding
to
her
fatigue
she
lies
down
upon
the
straw
and
falls
asleep
the
scene
changes
to
heaven
the
eyes
of
the
lord
which
upon
the
sons
of
men
are
turned
upon
the
earth
and
are
fixed
with
kindness
on
mary
whose
sleep
is
gentle
and
peaceful
then
as
the
great
moment
approaches
he
orders
the
angels
to
leave
heaven
and
announce
to
mankind
the
news
of
a
great
joy
he
gives
each
of
them
a
message
some
are
to
go
to
mary
others
to
simeon
the
humblest
of
them
says
and
i
lord
i
will
go
seek
the
least
of
all
and
tell
him
how
he
has
become
since
the
great
one
has
become
small
hymns
of
praise
immediately
resound
through
heaven
glory
to
thee
almighty
lord
and
the
angels
depart
upon
their
mission
the
scene
changes
and
we
are
once
more
in
the
stable
at
bethlehem
mary
awakes
and
is
still
alone
her
heart
is
agitated
by
the
most
astounding
thoughts
the
mystery
of
god
which
she
discerns
surprises
and
confounds
her
strange
a
virgin
yet
a
mother
of
a
son
above
all
other
very
god
and
very
man
emanuel
of
the
father
dearest
son
may
my
hands
be
joined
with
thine
may
thy
lips
be
touched
by
mine
at
this
moment
the
angels
sent
by
god
arrive
they
enter
the
wretched
stable
filling
it
with
their
glory
and
each
salutes
the
poor
virgin
of
nazareth
in
his
own
fashion
one
of
them
says
all
hail
happy
dame
mother
of
the
son
thou
so
dearly
another
whose
character
appears
to
be
humility
addresses
the
child
little
child
pray
spare
me
not
though
i
small
i
shall
delight
to
wait
upon
you
day
and
night
to
wash
you
or
to
warm
your
at
this
point
joseph
returns
with
the
provisions
he
has
bought
he
is
distressed
at
his
inability
to
receive
becomingly
this
child
of
heaven
but
resolving
to
give
all
that
he
has
he
advances
towards
the
stable
on
a
sudden
he
stops
in
surprise
he
looks
a
divine
light
fills
the
humble
shed
and
shines
all
around
what
a
strange
gleam
there
comes
from
within
i
like
a
man
in
a
maze
i
am
quite
sure
i
never
before
saw
such
a
glorious
blaze
he
stops
at
the
threshold
and
looks
in
the
angels
have
disappeared
and
he
says
mary
i
see
has
not
lost
her
glee
her
face
with
joy
runs
but
why
does
she
stare
this
virgin
dear
so
constantly
on
the
floor
joseph
looks
more
carefully
as
he
stands
motionless
at
the
door
and
discovers
jesus
who
has
just
been
born
yes
is
the
child
the
honest
carpenter
does
not
know
what
to
do
he
dares
not
approach
and
yet
he
can
not
remain
apart
a
struggle
takes
place
in
his
soul
here
will
i
stay
no
i
must
go
in
at
last
joseph
comes
forward
he
looks
at
the
child
and
kneeling
humbly
before
him
worships
and
kisses
him
with
this
kiss
i
would
cool
my
heart
with
charity
burning
what
a
charming
child
so
handsome
and
mild
and
that
the
truth
i
assure
you
mary
is
uneasy
she
looks
at
the
child
so
weak
and
tender
and
is
distressed
at
having
nothing
to
wrap
him
in
for
the
night
is
cold
joseph
i
shall
light
this
taper
he
then
lights
the
lamp
where
shall
we
put
him
in
the
manger
here
no
better
place
in
all
the
inn
this
was
the
end
of
the
first
act
the
spectators
expressed
the
interest
they
felt
in
the
drama
at
once
so
serious
and
so
holy
and
even
the
cardinals
de
grammont
and
de
foix
found
nothing
in
it
contrary
to
the
doctrines
of
the
church
as
that
was
a
time
when
people
were
very
fond
of
diversion
joke
and
jest
followed
several
comic
characters
appeared
in
the
interlude
especially
a
poor
monk
who
was
the
soul
of
the
farce
this
was
not
margaret
composition
even
the
catholics
did
not
charge
her
with
it
the
jesters
retired
at
last
and
the
drama
proceeded
the
scene
represented
the
fields
round
bethlehem
where
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
were
keeping
their
flocks
during
the
watches
of
the
night
one
shepherd
worn
out
with
labour
another
with
the
wolf
had
fallen
asleep
some
shepherdesses
followed
their
example
but
one
shepherd
and
one
shepherdess
were
awake
and
communicating
their
thoughts
to
each
other
third
shepherd
a
something
keeps
me
wide
awake

usual
sleep
i
can
not
take

sure
for
the
fold

quite
secure
in
my
heart

my
eyes

true
son
through

to
us

been
restored
and

first
shepherdess
would
to
god
the
hour
was
nigh
third
shepherd
come
lord
and
no
longer
tarry
suddenly
a
bright
light
shines
over
the
fields
of
bethlehem
and
a
heavenly
voice
says
shepherds
awake
arise
behold
the
happy
day
when
god
by
works
for
ever
new
shall
his
great
love
display
the
sleeping

look
about
them
and
perceive

angels
surrounded
with
a
heavenly
glory
first
shepherd

brightness

the
hymn
of
praise
glory

to
god
most
high
second
shepherd
let
us
haste
and
feast
our
eyes
where
the
hope
of
mortals
lies
third
shepherd
in
a
hut
so
mean
and
poor
if
we
can
not
pass
the
door
we
can
through
some
crevice
spy
where
our
lord
and
king
doth
lie
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
converse
as
they
go
on
the
reception
they
will
give
to
the
messiah
with
a
simplicity
that
may
appear
excessive
but
which
is
not
devoid
of
grace
and
genuineness
first
shepherd
and
shepherdess
let
us
from
our
plenty
bear
presents
to
their
scanty
fare
third
shepherd

enough
but
to
kiss
him
in
the
foot
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
all
leave
the
fields
and
hurry
to
bethlehem
the
scene
again
changes
to
this
town
where
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
arrive
and
look
for
the
place
where
the
child
lies
second
shepherd
in
this
house
with
paint
so
gay
the
holy
child
would
never
stay
third
shepherd
nor
in
this
palace
would
he
rest
but
rather
in
some
humbler
nest
first
shepherdess
there
a
place
in
this
rude
rock
can
it
be
the
honoured
spot
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
draw
near
and
looking
through
the
cracks
in
the
wall
of
the
poor
stable
discover
mary
and
jesus
the
second
shepherd
exclaims
with
rapture
there
the
child
and
there
the
mother
third
shepherdess

how
mild
hangs
on
his
mother
breast
the
child
second
shepherd

shepherd
the
true
fruit
of
heaven
we
seek
mary
if
god
hath
this
great
fact
revealed
by
us
it
must
not
be
concealed
for
to
believers
we
the
christ
must
show
open
the
door
joseph
the
you
can
come
in
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
approach
respectfully
and
puny
as
the
child
appears
they
recognise
in
him
the
height
of
the
eternal
majesty
and
worship
him
third
shepherd
thou
art
the
promised
seed
to
adam
after
his
misdeed
abraham
and
david
on
this
relied
and
both
alike
were
justified
second
shepherd
the
eye
beholds
a
weak
and
powerless
child
but
faith
which
comes
of
knowledge
bids
us
bow
in
honour
and
in
adoration
at
his
feet
as
the
true
god
after
the
adoration
of
the
shepherds
the
shepherdesses
a
little
curious
surround
mary
and
enter
into
conversation
with
her
third
shepherdess
how
no
costly
robes
he
owns
silver
and
gold
and
precious
stones
mary
simplicity
he
liketh
best
nor
will
he
in
choice
clothes
be
dressed
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
begin
to
appear
second
shepherd
the
day
is
near
i
must
begone
first
shepherdess
may
i
just
give
his
little
toe
one
single
kiss
before
i
go
third
shepherdess
our
hands
have
touched
our
eyes
have
seen
the
lamb
who
takes
away
our
sin
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
then
present
their
humble
offerings
first
shepherd
serving
thee
we
live
and
die
for
without
thee
life
is
naught
the
second
act
being
finished
a
new
interlude
was
introduced
to
make
the
spectators
merry
the
jesters
reappeared
and
recited
several
rondeaux
always
containing
some
piquant
and
unexpected
joke
which
called
forth
the
laughter
of
the
audience
the
burden
of
the
poems
composed
of
very
short
lines
and
with
two
rhymes
usually
turned
on
some
monk
which
greatly
diverted
the
spectators
the
cardinals
and
the
catholics
who
took
pleasure
in
the
drama
were
annoyed
by
the
satires
the
third
act
began
satan
who
was
making
the
tour
of
the
world
arrived
over
the
fields
of
bethlehem
whither
the
shepherds
had
returned
and
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
said
to
himself
i
have
reigned
until
this
hour
and
subdued
earth
to
my
power
with
god
above
have
warred
unceasing
and
my
triumphs
are
increasing
the
shepherdesses
to
whom
he
was
invisible
expressed
their
joy
in
hymns
shepherdesses
maidens
fair
listen
to
the
song
we
sing
tidings
of
great
joy
we
bring
that
take
away
all
mortal
care
satan
stopped
and
listened
becoming
alarmed
he
exclaimed
this
is
a
hymn
that
chills
my
blood
what
tidings
have
they
heard
the
shepherdesses
still
unconscious
of
satan
presence
continue
singing
hail
to
the
hail
to
the
lord
and
son
who
in
this
happy
morn
the
veil
of
earth
puts
on
loud
praise
to
god
be
given
who
makes
us
heirs
of
heaven
satan
listening
and
still
more
uneasy
to
learn
this
secret
how
i
toiled
shall
it
be
hidden
from
me
now
he
disguises
himself
and
approaches
the
shepherds
under
the
form
of
a
great
lord
and
says
to
them
whence
come
you
first
shepherd
from
seeing
christ
the
saviour
of
mankind
by
whom
in
god
we
are
regenerate
will
you
not
go
and
see
him
mighty
lord
i
show
the
way
satan
can
this
be
true
or
is
it
all
a
dream
second
shepherd
go
and
see
for
yourself
satan
god
from
his
throne
on
high
for
this
world
does
not
care
i
am
its
king
yes
i
come
with
me
and
make
good
cheer
but
you
must
believe
no
that
god
can
ever
stoop
so
low
third
shepherd
he
is
my
father
brother
all
i
am
his
from
head
to
foot
god
is
for
me
and
no
false
one
shall
this
heavenly
faith
uproot
satan
fools
and
madmen
are
ye
gods
first
shepherd
to
the
son
we
leave
the
glory
of
being
god
enough
for
us
to
be
he
pleases
and
to
know
that
he
the
great
i
am
satan
you
understand
the
scriptures
third
shepherd
all
humbleness
we
read
satan
were
he
your
father
as
you
call
him
would
he
leave
you
thus
accursed
suffering
poverty
and
want
blind
ones
open
wide
your
eyes
have
you
ever
known
a
rich
man
leave
his

he

over
he

on

the

some
of

gave
rise
to
rumours
among

on
the
other
certain
traditional

that
margaret
and
some
of
his

displeasing
to
the

altars
images
holidays
dedicated
to
mary
and
the
saints
confessors
and
of
these
things
appeared
to
him
scriptural
and
he
sighed
for
the
time
when
he
could
make
the
evangelical
principle
prevail
in
all
its
integrity
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
all

calvin
stayed
at

with

of
a
learned
ecclesiastic
and
a
friend
of
the
du

who
had
a
house
there
the

was
flourishing
it
possessed
learned
professors
and
had
a
famous

here
the
prior
of
conversed
with
his
two
guests
on
the
public
disputations
that
were
going
on
in
the
university
this
excited
attention
he
went
to
the
hall
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
and
listened
attentively
no
one
as
he
looked
at
this
stranger
would
have
supposed
that
under
those
pale
unattractive
features
was
hidden
one
of
the
heroes
who
change
the
face
of
the
world
in
the
name
of
truth
alone
beneath
much
quibbling
and
idle
trash
the
young
doctor
could
see
flashes
of
light
here
and
there
after
the
disputation
he
called
upon
those
combatants
from
whom
he
had
heard
the
language
of
christianity
he
stated
his
own
ideas
and
ere
long
the
beauty
of
his
genius
and
the
frankness
of
his
language
won
them
over
calvin
and
these
generous
men
became
friends
and
visited
each
other
at
length
says
an
historian
began
to
take
walks
together
without
the
city
and
as
they
walked
along
the
banks
of
the
little
river
clain
or
rambled
over
the
fields
the
young
doctor
spoke
to
them
openly
of
christ
and
of
eternity
they
did
not
trouble
themselves
indeed
with
scholastic
theology
and
metaphysical
formulas
calvin
aimed
at
the
conquest
of
their
souls
he
required
in
every
one
the
formation
of
a
new
man
and
cared
about
nothing
else
in
the
midst
of
the
disheartening
weaknesses
and
immense
necessities
of

was
about

at

a
work
of

indeed
no
long
time
elapsed
before
numerous
hearers
crowded
round
him
some
were
offended
by
his
words
and
there
were
some
who
looking
only
for
disputations
and
sophistry
tormented
the
young
doctor
with
their
accustomed
insolence
while
others
opposed
the
heretic
dilemmas
and

others
again
who
thought
themselves
masters
of

turned
their
backs
on
him
if
he
were

from

in

as
it
did
at
the
time
of

but
le

another
of

kept
himself
rather
aloof
he
was
from

and
was
not
very
anxious
to
put
himself
in
the
train
of
the
son
of
the
old
episcopal
secretary
moreover
he
believed
sincerely
in
the
miracle
of

this

of
distinguished
men
which
now
gathered
round

at

as
formerly

which
is

whether
for

to

calvin
having
retired
to
poitiers
soon
met
with
good
store
of
friends
he
met
them
at
the
university
went
to
see
them
at
their
houses
courted
their
society
and
spoke
freely
of
the
knowledge
of
god
on
many
points
they
thought
from
the
very
first
like
him
when
he
complained
they
worshipped
stocks
and
stones
prayed
to
the
dead
trusted
in
vain
things
and
desired
to
serve
god
by
idle
ceremonies
everybody
agreed
with
him
even
le
sage
but
the
young
doctor
went
still
farther
doubtless
he
condemned
rugged
austerity
he
recommended
people
to
be
aimables
and
kind
to
their
neighbours
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
true
even
at
the
risk
of
displeasing
being
present
one
day
when
some
sincere
catholics
were
defending
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
calvin
unhesitatingly
declared
that
we
must
receive
christ
even
his
body
and
blood
by
faith
by
the
spirit
which
gives
life
and
not
by
a
sensual
eating
with
the

le

exclaimed
quite
shocked
that
this
was
the
opinion
of
the
heretic
wickliffe
and
even

in

at
seeing

if

lost

the

desired
to
see
him
and
invited
him
to
dine
with

calvin
accepted
the

which
caused
some

innovator
said
the
catholics
to
court
the
magistrates
in
order
that
they
may
give
him
importance
by
their
condescension
calvin
never
made
any
such
calculations
but
he
was
with
great
zeal
to
extend
the
glory
of
the
lord
on
every
side
he
was
received
with
respect
and
took
his
seat
at

table
during

would
seem
on
mere
as
soon
as
the
meal
was

of

house
turning
the
conversation
on
luther
and
zwingle
blamed
the
reformers
and
especially
their
opinions
on
the
mass
was
a
frequent
topic
of
conversation
says
a
writer
of
the
sixteenth
century
only
among
the
learned
but
among
the
common
people
and
was
even
talked
of
at
table
calvin
who
was
well
informed
and
prepared
entered
upon
the
subject
and
explained
the
chief
points
saw
the
truth
he
said
he
is
like
those
who
are
walking
through
a
long
and
winding
road
they
perceive
afar
the
dim
glimmer
of
a
lamp
by
means
of
which
they
can
grope
their
way
along
the
path
they
must
follow
zwingle
approached
the
light
but
like
those
who
rush
too
hastily
to
good
he
went
beyond
it
then
wishing
them
to
understand
what
there
was
in
the
lord
supper
he
stated
more
in
detail
the
idea
of
the
presence
of
christ
a
real
one
no
doubt
but
to
be
received
by
faith
and
not
by
the
mouth
thus
taking
a
middle
position
between
zwingle
and
luther
these
discourses
being
as
clear
as
they
were
forcible
convinced
the
and
the
friends
he
had
assembled
calvin
was
requested
to
commit
them
to
writing
which
he
did

the
historian
with
an
eloquence
that
brought
him

subsequently

it
was
he
whom

perfidiously
interrogated
one
day
in
her
closet
whilst
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
was
hidden
behind
the
tapestry
sidenote
garden
of
the
henceforth
the
garden
of
the
became
a
favourite
resort
with
calvin
he
was
accustomed
to
go
there
freely
and
openly
there
like
socrates
in
the
garden
of
academe
the
young
christian
plato
and
his
friends
sought
for
truth
the
truth
which
the
reformation
was
then
restoring
to
the
world
was
of
quite
a
different
order
and
of
far
greater
power
than
that
of
the
greek
philosophers
wherever
its
voice
was
heard
the
idea
of
a
clerical
priesthood
disappeared
the
prerogatives
of
monastic
life
vanished
and
a
personal
individual
living
christianity
took
their
place
the
divine
revelations
were
given
to
laymen
in
their
and
the
sacraments
stripped
of
their
pretended
magical
virtues
exercised
a
spiritual
influence
over
the
heart
such
were
the
principles
professed
by
calvin
in
the
garden
of
the
as
he
walked
up
and
down
beneath
the
pleasant
shade
he
spoke
to
his
friend
of
the
heavenly
father
of
his
only
son
of
grace
and
of
eternal
life
his
disciples
as
they
listened
imagined
that
all
things
were
about
to
become
new
and
said
to
one
another
that
now
at
last
a
barren
formalism
in
the
church
would
give
way
to
a
living
breath
from
heaven
the
catholics
of
poitiers
were
distressed
our
first
parents
they
said
enchanted
in
a
garden
so
it
was
in
the
garden
of
the
that
this
handful
of
men
were
cajoled
and
duped
by
calvin
who
easily
made
a
breach
in
the
souls
of
those
who
listened
to
him
this
is
a
remarkable
confession
one
day
a
meeting
was
held
there
at
which
calvin
and
his
friends
consulted
about
what
france
needed
most
the
answer
was
easy
the
gospel
but
france
alas
rejected
it
they
did
not
confine
themselves
to
this
topic
and
calvin
was
anxious
to
substitute
in
the
church
the
spirit
for
the
form
life
and
reality
for
ritual
observances
he
acquitted
himself
worthily
of
his
task
and
taking
up
the
principal
point
explained
specially
his
spiritual
doctrine
on
the
presence
says
the
catholic
historian
the
first
calvinist
council
held
in
france
the
word
is
too
ambitious
but
it
was
a
meeting
that
bore

the
living
faith
which
inspired
the
young

gained
over
a
few
rebellious
spirits
de

who
raised
numerous
objections
at
first
but
who
was
a
man
of
common
sense
and
conscience
thought
that
he
might
possibly
be
mistaken
seed
fallen
into
his
heart
began
to
grow
and
it
put
forth
fruit
in
the
season
god
had
ordained
the
agitation
which
calvin
excited
in
poitiers
the
admiration
of
some
the
uneasiness
of
others
grew
stronger
every
day
the
friends
of
the
gospel
began
to
run
some
risk
by
meeting
together
if
certain
fanatics
should
make
themselves
masters
of
the
populace
the
garden
of
the
might
be
attacked
and
the
police
under
colour
of
restoring
order
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
arrest
the
stranger
there
were
often
false
alarms
calvin
friends
determined
to
look
for
some
solitary
place
where
they
might
assemble
in
peace
one
of
them
having
pointed
out
a
in
the
adjacent
number
of
deep
and
isolated
caverns
which
would
shelter
them
from
all
investigations
determined
to
go
thither
in
little
bands
and
by
different
roads
sidenote
calvin
grotto
the
next
day
the
project
was
put
in
execution
calvin
set
out
with
two
or
three
others
they
traversed
the
pretty
suburb
of
benedict
took
a
picturesque
footpath
and
after
about
an
hour
walking
arrived
at
a
spot
in
front
of
the
ruins
of
a
roman
aqueduct
beneath
them
flowed
the
tranquil
waters
of
the
clain
thickly
wooded
rocks
containing
caverns
of
various
depths
raised
their
imposing
masses
above
the
stream
calvin
was
charmed
with
the
solitude
gradually
others
arrived
and
the
assembly
was
soon
complete
calvin
and
his
friends
entered
one
of
the
largest
of
these
caves
they
were
usually
known
as
the
caves
of
benedict
or
the
croutelles
but
this
one
was
called
and
has
ever
since
borne
the
name
of
calvin
grotto
the
reformer
took
his
stand
on
the
highest
ground
his
disciples
gathered
round
him
some
of
them
leaning
against
the
rock
and
in
the
midst
of
a
solemn
silence
he
began
to
teach
them
expounding
what
was
grandest
of
christ
to
them
this
was
a
topic
to
which
he
was
constantly
reverting
be
deprived
of
everything
and
possess
christ
he
said
one
day
the
ship
is
in
danger
the
sailors
throw
everything
overboard
that
they
may
reach
the
port
in
safety
do
likewise
riches
honours
rank
outward
should
be
sacrificed
to
possess
christ
he
is
our
only
blessedness
calvin
spoke
with
much
authority
he
carried
away
his
readers
and
was
himself
carried
away
on
a
sudden
feeling
his
spiritual
weakness
and
the
need
they
all
had
of
the
holy
ghost
he
fell
on
his
knees
beneath
those
solitary
vaults
all
the
assembly
knelt
with
him
and
he
raised
to
the
throne
of
god
a
prayer
so
touching
and
so
earnest
that
all
who
heard
him
fancied
themselves
transported
to
heaven
these
pilgrimages
to
benedict
caves
were
soon
observed
persons
might
follow
the
little
groups
on
their
way
to
the
meeting
and
surprise
the
assembly
calvin
friends
resolved
to
change
their
place
of
meeting
frequently
sometimes
going
to
a
village
at
others
to
an
isolated
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbourhood
would
join
the
little
flock
and
the
preacher
would
bring
forward
that
christian
truth
which
enlightens
the
world
and
man
when
they
separated
he
gave
books
to
every
one
even
prayers
written
with
his
own
hand
sidenote
calvin
on
the
mass
calvin
opposition
to
the
mass
gave
greater
offence
every
day
the
catholics
charged
him
with
the
crime
of
daring
to
deny
that
the
priest
offered
christ
himself
in
sacrifice
as
an
expiatory
victim
for
the
sins
of
the
people
he
was
moved
by
these
observations
but
not
shaken
one
day
when
he
and
his
friends
were
assembled
in
the
cavern
he
extolled
the
sacrifice
of
the
cross
offered
according
to
scripture
and
then
spoke
so
forcibly
against
the
mass
that
it
was
not
possible
said
earnest
catholics
to
hear
him
without
shuddering
it
is
true
that
calvin
did
not
spare
this
romish
ceremony
he
sometimes
called
it
a
and
burlesque
call
it
a
he
said
they
mock
the
supper
of
the
lord
just
as
a
monkey
imitates
clumsily
whatever
he
sees
others
do
i
call
it
a
burlesque
because
the
nonsense
and
gestures
they
introduce
are
better
adapted
to
a
than
to
so
holy
a
mystery
there
were
in
the
cave
some
who
believed
sincerely
in
transubstantiation
and
who
habitually
attended
mass
with
pious
sentiments
calvin
they
may
not
have
been
literally
those
we
have
and
vexed
them
and
le
sage
abruptly
interrupting
him
exclaimed
lord
very
god
and
very
man
is
really
and
substantially
under
the
appearance
of
the
bread
and
the
wine
in
all
ages
wherever
men
have
known
christ
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
has
been
offered
up
surprised
at
this
bold
outbreak
calvin
asked
himself
if
he
had
committed
a
crime
in
setting
the
word
of
god
above
the
traditions
of
rome
he
kept
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
then
lifting
his
hand
and
putting
it
on
the
bible
that
lay
open
before
him
he
exclaimed
earnestly
is
my
mass
then
uncovering
his
head
and
placing
his
fur
cap
on
the
table
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
said
with
emotion
lord
if
in
the
day
of
judgment
thou
desirest
to
punish
me
because
i
have
deserted
the
mass
i
will
say
to
thee
o
god
thou
hast
not
commanded
me
to
celebrate
it
behold
thy
law
behold
thy
holy
thou
didst
give
it
us
to
be
our
guide
and
i
can
find
no
other
sacrifice
in
it
than
that
which
was
accomplished
on
the
altar
of
the
cross
the
hearers
separated
in
great
excitement
touched
with
the
reformer
faith
at
once
so
simple
and
so
strong
and
it
was
with
new
convictions
that
some
of
them
retraced
the
solitary
paths
that
conducted
them
to
poitiers
from
that
time
many
persons
manifested
a
desire
to
receive
the
supper
according
to
the
lord
institution
the
various
ceremonies
the
incense
the
choral
chants
satisfied
them
no
longer
they
wished
to
have
a
simple
and
real
communion
with
the
saviour
a
day
was
therefore
appointed
and
they
assembled
in
one
of
the
caves
of
st
benedict
the
minister
read
the
word
of
god
and
called
upon
the
lord
to
pour
out
his
spirit
on
the
little
flock
he
broke
the
bread
and
handed
round
the
cup
and
then
invited
the
worshippers
to
communicate
mutually
such
reflections
and
experiences
as
might
be
useful
to
the
faith
these
simple
exhortations
after
the
supper
were
continued
for
some
time
in
the
reformed
church

intimate
with
some
of

disciples
and
occasionally
receiving
them
at
his
table
he
begged
them
to
bring
the
young
doctor
and
from
that
day
calvin
became
one
of
his
guests
according
to
a
tradition
preserved
in
the
province
although
the
conversations
he
had
with
the
abbot
did
not
convert
him
they
made
him
take
pleasure
in
the
gospel
and
he
soon
asked
himself
why
this
astonishing
young
man
should
not
preach
in

benedictine
church
to
address
a
learned
and
religious
community

to
his
monks
that

picard
brought
up
in
the
university
of

and
the
holder
of
a
benefice
at
noyon
would
preach
in

calvin
went
into
the
pulpit
and
declared
that
whosoever
had
a
firm
and
lively
faith
in
the
grace
of
christ
was
saved
some
of
his
hearers
were
startled
at
a
doctrine
which
made
the
romish
priesthood
of
no
use
a
perverse
doctrine
they
said
does
the
abbot
allow
this
picard
to
preach
it
in
his
church
on
the
other
hand
the
abbot
george
was
delighted
with
the
young
man
sermons
but
hesitated
to
take
the
decisive
step
the
benedictine
abbeys
were
independent
powerful
and
rich
the
monks
generally
belonged
to
noble
families
and
surpassed
the
other
religious
orders
in
intelligence
morality
and
extensive
familiarity
with
classical
and
christian
learning
ponthus
felt
a
difficulty
in
leaving
the
quiet
life
he
led
in
his
abbey
or
in
sacrificing
his
rich
benefice
and
exposing
himself
to
the
vengeance
of
the
laws
he
entertained
the
idea
of
reconciling
the
church
with
the
world
according
to
the
system
patronised
by
margaret
of
navarre
he
would
remain
an
abbot
but
he
would
be
a
christian
abbot
like
roussel

although
wearing
his
friar
dress
in
the
pulpit
he
would
preach
the
gospel
from

made

his

professed
them

without

grew
louder
throughout
the

said
the

who
are
caught
in

still
cling
to
their

do
not

to
their
and

robes

they
are

lutherans
they
discharge
their
functions
without

they

felt
ill
at
ease
his
honest
soul
did
not
long
permit
him
to
halt
on
both
sides
he
sacrificed
a
brilliant
position
dismissed
his
monks
set
some
to
study
and
others
to
learn
trades
and
then
feeling
convinced
as
luther
did
that
a
forced
celibacy
is
a
disorder
invented
by
men
and
that
marriage
is
the
order
of
god
he
took
a
wife
the
abbot
of
valence
says
an
historian
was
the
first
abbot
in
france
who
lifted
the
mask
and
showed
himself
an
open
lutheran
his
brothers
followed
the
example
he
had
set
them

of

eldest
the
baron
of
couhé
was
the
first
of
the
family
to
give
his
blood
for
the
protestant
cause
thus
did
the
four
brothers
full
of
zeal
for
the
reformation
prepare
for
themselves
and
for
their
children
a
life
of
suffering
combat
and
exile
but
also
of
faith
hope
and
peace
sidenote
three
missionaries
sent
out
when
calvin
saw
this
movement
of
life
going
on
around
him
he
thought
of
france
would
she
remain
behind
germany
and
switzerland
no
france
will
awake
she
is
already
waking
erelong
she
will
receive
the
gospel
in
its
holy
purity
and
will
increase
in
morality
in
light
and
in
liberty
such
were
his
hopes
but
for
their
realisation
men
were
needed
who
being
regenerate
themselves
should
be
with
god
in
this
new
creation
calvin
asked
himself
whether
some
of
the
converts
of
poitiers
were
not
called
to
this
work
alas
what
a
small
company
for
so
large
a
kingdom
how
great
the
weakness
of
the
gospel
compared
with
the
magnificence
of
rome
acts
thus
he
said
order
to
strip
us
of
all
pride
and
therefore
he
chooses
the
weak
ones
of
this
world
to
confound
the
strong
if
the
iron
grows
red
in
the
fire
he
added
is
that
it
may
be
forged
he
wished
to
forge
it
and
to
make
serviceable
instruments
out
of
it
one
day
being
at
the
usual
meeting
he
said
there
any
one
here
willing
to
go
and
give
light
to
those
whom
the
pope
has
blinded
jean
vernou
philip
véron
and
albert
babinot
stood
forward
calvin
had
not
forgotten
the
angoumois
where
he
possessed
beloved
friends
thither
and
into
the
adjacent
provinces
he
will
first
send
his
missionaries
and
commence
the
evangelisation
of
france
babinot
will
go
into
guyenne
and
languedoc
he
said
véron
you
will
go
into
saintonge
and
angoumois
and
you
jean
vernou
will
stay
at
poitiers
and
the
neighbourhood
calvin
and
the
other
brethren
did
not
think
that
these
missionaries
required
regular
theological
studies
had
they
not
received
the
necessary
gifts
from
god
more
nor
less
than
if
he
had
given
them
with
his
own
hand
but
they
had
need
to
be
recommended
to
the
almighty
grace
of
god
they
therefore
prayed
together
and
calvin
called
upon
the
lord
to
accept
the
services
of
these
pious
men
he
told
them
to
go
and
proclaim
the
gospel
not
in
the
name
of
any
man
but
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
because
god
commanded
it
a
collection
provided
for
the
expenses
of
this
mission
and
the
evangelists
departed

having
reached
the
banks
of
the
garonne
and
entered

to

who
were
studying
there

was

upright
zealous
in

at
the
same
time
very
gentle
so
that
he
was
called
bonhomme
many
students
were
brought
to
the
light
by
him
he
next
began
to
visit
several
little
flocks
in
the
neighbourhood
and
celebrated
the
lord
supper
with
them
after
the
manner
which
the
man
of

as
he
called
calvin
had
taught
him

through
the
country
praying
secretly
here
and
there
in
humble
conventicles

véron
who
was
as
remarkable
for
his
activity
as
babinot
for
his
gentleness
carried
also
into
every
place
the
news
of
the

he
spent
more
than
twenty
years
in
this
occupation
he
walked
on

and

said

who
could

see
the
difference
between
the
call

and
the

of

answered

entered
into

and
hence
he
was
called

gatherer
marches
out

does
not
leave
a
corner
of

where
he
does
not
go
sounding
his
way
to
try
and
make
some
prize
on
arriving
in
any
town
or
village
he
inquired
for
the
best
disposed
persons
entered
their
houses
and
sought
to
instruct
them
in
the
truth
he
had
taken
with
him
some
of
calvin
manuscripts
and
when
he
desired
to
strengthen
his
hearers
souls
he
would
take
them
out
of
his
and
show
them
saying
that
they
were
the
writings
of
a
great
man
and
then
after
reading
a
few
extracts
he
would
return
them
carefully
to
their
place
said
fervent
these
papers
as
a
great
curiosity
as
if
they
were
sibylline
verses
sidenote
the
reform
and
the
young
these
evangelists
especially
addressed
the
young
calvin
would
not
have
religious
instruction
neglected
or
subordinated
to
secular
instruction
it
should
have
its
separate
place
he
believed
that
all
culture
but
especially
religious
teaching
ought
to
begin
with
early
youth
that
the
soul
then
possesses
a
power
of
receiving
and
appropriating
what
is
set
before
it
that
it
never
will
have
again
and
that
if
the
seeds
of
a
religious
life
are
not
sown
and
do
not
germinate
in
the
heart
of
the
child
the
man
will
perish
wholly
he
had
said
to
the
three
evangelists
your
first
attention
be
always
to
the
professors
and
schoolmasters
the
zealous
catholics
observed
this
method
they
said
youth
is
easily
led
astray
they
hide
the
under
the
cloak
of
the
master
calvin
friends
thus
instilled
their
doctrines
into
the
schools
of
guyenne
sarrasin
converted
another
schoolmaster
named
vendocin
who
became
so
firm
a
christian
that
he
preferred
to
be
burnt
over
a
slow
fire
to
abjuring
calvinism
the
men
who
devoutly
adhered
to
the
formulas
of
rome
were
grieved
when
they
saw
the
young
so
readily
receiving
the
evangelical
doctrine
at
bordeaux
and
toulouse
at
angoulême
and
aden
in
the
cloisters
in
the
and
even
in
the
the
loudest
complaints
were
made
the
name
they
gave
to
calvin
missionaries
are
doing
much
mischief
in
the
schools
they
said
soon
as
the
captains
of
the
young
the
masters
are
conquered
the
little
soldiers
march
under
their
colours
the
heads
of
folks
are
more
easily
disturbed
by
the
heretic
than
the
old
they
rush
into
danger
without
examining
it
and
they
are
lost
before
they
are
aware
of
it
they
embrace
these
new
doctrines
with
such
courage
that
many
who
have
only
down
on
their
chins
expose
themselves
to
voluntary
death
and
thus
lose
both
soul
and
body
sidenote
the

and

while
babinot
and
véron
were
traversing
the
south
john
vernou
held
firm
at
poitiers
and
aroused
the
students
the
reformation
is
fond
of
learning
it
looks
upon
science
as
the
friend
of
religion
faith
it
says
does
not
require
of
christians
to
know
only
what
is
learnt
by
faith
or
not
to
know
scientifically
what
they
ought
to
learn
it
desires
that
we
should
know
and
know
well
but
on
the
other
hand
it
believes
that
true
science
can
not
require
of
the
adept
to
despise
the
truths
that
faith
reveals
it
is
essential
to
the
progress
of
humanity
that
there
should
always
be
a
good
understanding
between
faith
and
science
and
accordingly
the
reformation
calls
upon
them
to
be
united
unhappily
disagreement
is
possible
and
even
easy
the
philosopher
and
the
christian
fall
with
great
facility
into
a
lamentable
onesidedness
which
makes
the
former
despise
religion
and
the
latter
science
in
order
that
faith
and
science
should
seek
each
other
and
unite
the
moral
element
should
prevail
in
those
who
are
engaged
with
both
if
it
is
weakened
religion
easily
produces
fanatics
and
science
unbelievers
a
moral
torpor
the
sleep
of
conscience
is
in
every
age
the
great
and
only
explanation
of
these
two
lamentable
errors
as
soon
as
the
conscience
is
awakened
as
soon
as
that
holy
light
is
kindled
in
man
there
is
no
longer
any
fanaticism
or
incredulity
such
were
calvin
thoughts
his
disciple
vernou
endeavoured
like
himself
to
unite
faith
with
science
in
the
university
of
poitiers
and
scattered
among
the
youth
who
frequented
it
as
history
tells
us
the
seeds
of
christian
doctrine
calvin
three
missionaries
babinot
véron
and
vernou
were
soon
famous
throughout
the
west
of
france
and
the
wrath
of
the
clergy
of
all
ranks
and
even
of
laymen
of
note
knew
no
bounds
the
college
professors
hunted
in
their
homers
for
terms
of
abuse
to
heap
on
these
heralds
of

word
three
worthy
apostles
they
said
the
agents
of
the
decrees
of
the
calvin
and
the
firebrands

are

who
set
themselves
up
as

were
born
yesterday
like

and
yet
they
trace
their
genealogy
as
if
they
were
descended
from
the
apostles
ulysses

we
know
killed
the
beggar
irus
with
a
blow

these
disdainful
and
bitter
critics
remembered
this
and
hoped
that
the
kings
of
france
would
give
a
to
the
reform
they
dealt
the
blow
but
protestantism
was
not
slain
when
calvin
was
subsequently
settled
at
geneva
babinot
véron
and
vernou
paid
him
a
visit
they
were
delighted
to
find
the
christian
professor
surrounded
with
respect
and
were
never
tired
of
listening
to
him
from
whose
lips
they
had
heard
at
poitiers
the
first
words
of
life
they
did
not
however
stay
with
him
babinot
and
véron
returned
to
the
west
of
france
to
continue
to
propagate
the
gospel
there
which
they
did
until
their
death
as
for
vernou
he
was
seized
while
crossing
the
mountains
of
savoy
and
was
burnt
alive
at
chambery
confessing
jesus

his
saviour
let

return

poitiers
sidenote
calvin
leaves
poitiers
the
prior
of
with
whom
calvin
was
staying
was
one
of
those
who
though
fond
of
learning
and
the
gospel
did
not
wish
to
break
with
the
church
the
conversations
at
the
the
in
the
caves
of
benedict
the
evangelisation
of
the
city
and
country
all
made
him
uneasy
he
was
alarmed
at
the
thought
that
the
officers
might
knock
at
his
door
some
day
and
that
the
would
be
taken
in
his
house
he
therefore
advised
calvin
to
continue
his
journey
the
reformer
had
ended
his
task
he
was
now
to
turn
his
steps
elsewhere
he
bade
his
friends
farewell
as
he
left
them
he
could
say
like
his
master
will
i
if
the
fire
be
already
kindled
calvin
established
the
date
of
the
reformation
at
poitiers
when
writing
at
a
later
period
to
the
church
which
assembled
in
that
city
he
said
not
go
astray
from
the
doctrine
which
you
have
received
part
from
since
it
has
pleased
god
to
make
use
of
for
your
salvation
although
removed
he
still
continued
to
be
the
director
of
that
church
know
full
well
that
you
are
guêtés
by
the
enemy
he
wrote
to
them
let
not
the
fear
of
persecution
hinder
you
from
seeking
the
pastures
of
life
there
is
a
middle
line
between
temerity
and
timidity
remain
tranquilly
in
your
but
beware
my
brethren
that
you
do
not
shut
the
door
against
those
who
desire
to
come
to
the
kingdom
of
god
one
thought
absorbed
him
at
the
time
he
left
poitiers
it
was
the
month
of
april
on
the
of
july
he
would
be
years
old
a
regulation
of
the
church
confirmed
by
the
council
of
trent
fixed
this
as
the
age
at
which
those
who
have
received
the
tonsure
were
promoted
to
the
priesthood
in
early
youth
he
had
received
the
tonsure
that
symbol
of
sacerdotal
royalty
borrowed
jerome
tells
us
from
the
pagan
priests
of
isis
and
serapis
and
his
age
now
summoned
him
to
enter
holy
orders
he
did
not
want
for
friends
who
advised
him
to
remain
in
the
church
for
its
reformation
the
chapel
of
gesine
at
noyon
and
the
cure
of
pont
awaited
him
and
many
other
doors
would
open
before
him
he
was
invited
to
come
and
put
himself
in
due
order
but
calvin
shrank
in
alarm
from
the
idea
of
enrolling
himself
among
the
pope
soldiers
i
make
myself
the
pope
vassal
he
said
can
i
conscientiously
fight
against
the
papists
the
sovereign
majesty
of
god
would
be
offended
i
would
sooner
give
up
not
only
one
benefice
but
a
hundred
even
of
the
most
brilliant
o
cursed
wealth
of
the
church
there
is
not
a
single
penny
of
it
that
is
not
defiled
with
cheating
sacrilege
and
robbery
there
was
no
ecclesiastical
dignity
to
which
a
mind
so
preeminently
administrative
might
not
aspire
but
calvin
was
convinced
that
to
save
the
church
it
was
necessary
to
sacrifice
rome
two
paths
lay
before
him
one
broad
and
easy
the
other
narrow
and
difficult
his
choice
was
not
doubtful
gospel
he
said
more
than
all
the
riches
honour
and
ease
of
this
world
i
am
ready
to
give
up
everything
that
withdraws
me
from
it
calvin
left
poitiers
accompanied
by
his
faithful
du
tillet
who
for
two
years
scarcely
ever
quitted
him
the
young
canon
was
one
of
those
honest
but
weak
natures
who
have
absolute
need
of
a
support
and
who
not
knowing
how
to
find
it
in
the
word
of
god
seek
it
in
strong
men
he
therefore
attached
himself
to
the
young
reformer
as
the
vine
to
the
elm
alas
the
day
was
to
come
when
terrified
by
persecution
and
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
break
with
the
church
he
would
cling
to
the
papacy
and
take
that
for
his
support
sidenote
impression
he
left
at
poitiers
a
surprising
transformation
had
been
effected
in
poitiers

calvin
left
behind
him

tears

am
distressed
that
you
have
been
taken
from
us
i
envy
the
country
where
you
are
and
my
only
consolation
is
that
our
university
is
now
filled
with
pious
and
learned
men
pray
to
god
that
by
the
spirit
of
christ
we
may
worthily
proclaim
the
gospel
in
the
midst
of
our
enemies
and
even
in
the

flames
calvin
passed
through
orleans
went
on
to
paris
and
then
proceeded
to
noyon
where
he
arrived
at
the
beginning
of
may
he
immediately
informed
his
relations
and
the
bishop
that
he
had
come
to
resign
his
benefices
we
may
imagine
the
astonishment
of
his
friends
what
let
slip
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
much
good
in
the
church
renounce
important
offices
to
join
an
obscure
sect
it
seemed
the
act
of
a
madman
but
nothing
could
bend
his
unshakeable
resolution
on
monday

in
the
presence
of
the

vicar
of

of

in
favour
of
master
anthony
de
la
marlière
and
his
cure
in
favour
of
another
ecclesiastic

it
would
even
appear

he
sold
his
patrimonial
property
at
the
same
time
having
broken
the
last
ties
that
bound
him
to
the
roman
church
calvin
began
to
speak
with
greater
freedom
to
those
around
him
of
the
gospel
he
had
found
in
his
father
house
two
brothers
and
a
sister
anthony
charles
and
mary
these
were
the
first
persons
he
invited
to
christ
in
affectionate
and
pious
conversations
he
then
turned
to
some
members
of
the
episcopal
clergy
and
other
inhabitants
of
noyon
he
put
his
hand
to
use
his
own
expression

who
were
running
elsewhere

anthony
and

were
the
first
to

germinated

very
low
in
france
he
wrote
many
people
long
for

the
clergy
became
uneasy
and
a
franciscan
friar
complained
that
heresy
of

entered

had
already
covered
so
much
ground
as
almost

even
in

noblemen
and
men
of
letters
citizens
students
and
many
of
the
lower
classes
hailed
the
reformation
as
the
commencement
of
a

day
who
have
any
sense
it
was
said
be
their
age
or

they

such
were
the
circumstances
under
which
calvin
came
to
reside
in
paris
at
the
house
of
his
friend

at
the
sign
of
the
in
the
rue

the
pious
tradesman
and
his
wife
received
him
with
the
most
cordial
hospitality
and
fearing
lest
he
should
again
expose
a
life
so
precious
to
the
church
they
conjured
him
not
to
trust
too
much
to
what
was
said
about
the
king
disposition
and
to
beware
of
teaching
in
public

he
would
not
risk
his

of

one
martyrdom
of
which
he
was
told
all
the
particulars
was
well
calculated
to
enforce
these
rules
of
prudence
calvin
did
not
find
in
paris
that
strong
and
decided
christian
pointet
the
surgeon
whom
he
had
often
seen
at
the
meetings
the
monks
whom
this
bold
man
had
reprimanded
so
soundly
for
their
immoralities
had
raised
a
clamour
against
him
leclerc
the
priest
of
had
prosecuted
him
he
had
been
imprisoned
in
the
conciergerie
and
condemned
to
be
burnt
after
being
strangled
this
was
paying
very
dearly
for
the
lessons
of
morality
he
had
given
the
friars
before
the
hour
of
execution
the
gaoler
had
taken
him
into
the
prison
chapel
and
left
him
there
with
a
monk
before
an
image
the
confessor
began
to
exhort
him
down
before
that
image
and
ask
pardon
for
your
sins
seeing
that
his
penitent
remained
motionless
he
seized
him
by
the
neck
to
force
him
upon
his
knees
but
pointet
who
was
naturally
of
a
temper
thrust
the
monk
back
roughly
saying
begone
and
do
not
tempt
me
to
turn
idolater
the
confused
and
exasperated
confessor
ran
hastily
out
of
the
chapel
and
going
to
the
criminal
chamber
told
the
president
and
his
two
assessors
what
had
passed
and
begged
them
to
come
and
bring
the
man
to
reason
is
a
madman
he
is
out
of
his
senses
exclaimed
the
magistrates
as
they
accompanied
the
confessor
these
three
individuals
who
had
just
condemned
pointet
to
be
strangled
having
repeated
the
invitation
which
the
monk
had
given
him
the
prisoner
who
was
annoyed
by
this
persecution
treated
them
as
he
had
treated
the
monk
he
called
them
wretches
murderers
robbers
who
unjustly
and
against
all
reason
put
to
death
the
children
of
god
the
three
judges
excited
and
terrified
in
their
turn
hurried
back
to
the
court
and
there
heated
by
passion
they
increased
the
severity
of
the
sentence
adding
that
pointet
should
have
his
tongue
cut
out
before
anything
else
was
done
to
him
had
not
that
tongue
called
them
murderers
it
was
hoped
that
he
would
now
show
himself
more
tractable
but
they
were
mistaken
the
steadfast
christian
could
not
speak
but
he
refused
to
make
the
least
sign
of
recantation
and
to
bend
his
head
before
an
image
the
enemies
of
truth
as
the
chronicle
styles
them
seeing
this
had
recourse
to
a
fresh
aggravation
of
the
sentence
they
condemned
him
to
be
burnt
alive
was
done
as
cruelly
as
they
could
devise
this
death
produced
a
deep
impression
on
the
minds
of
the
evangelical
christians
of
paris
calvin
yielding
to
the
representations
of
his
friends
resolved
to
substitute
admonitions
for
preaching
at
the
assemblies
and
began
by
visiting
the
humble
christians
whom
he
had
heard
spoken
of
at
la

the
paralytic
in
the
street
which
lay
between
the
two
gates
of

courts
there
was
a
shoemaker
shop
on
entering
it
no
one
was
seen
but
a
poor
hunchback
crippled
in
all
his
limbs
except
the
tongue
and
the
arms
this
paralytic
creature
was
the
shoemaker
son
and
by
name
bartholomew
said
his
father
robert
milon
to
those
who
expressed
their
compassion
at
the
sight
was
not
always
so
he
was
quite
another
person
in
his
youth
endowed
with
excellent
gifts
both
of
body
and
mind
in
fact
bartholomew
was
once
the
handsomest
man
of
the
parish
very
clever
and
full
of
liveliness
and
imagination
he
had
abused
these
gifts
he
had
followed
his
impassioned
disposition
and
had
launched
into
life
indulging
in
all
the
lusts
of
youth
in
foolish
amours
and
other
kinds
of
irregularities
with
which
young
folks
willingly
defile
themselves
continually
carried
away
by
his
impetuous
temper
he
equally
courted
pleasures
and
quarrels
he
rushed
into
the
midst
of
the
strife
as
soon
as
any
discussion
arose
and
displayed
unparalleled
temerity
in
all
his
disputes
he
got
up
balls
and
concerts
despised
the
things
of
god
turned
the
priests
into
ridicule
and
laughed
at
pious
men
everybody
in
the
quarter
talked
about
berthelot
as
he
was
called
and
of
his
exploits
some
with
admiration
others
with
fear

one
day
while
giddily
indulging
in
his
ordinary
diversions
he
met
with
a
fall
and
broke
his
ribs
as
he
would
not
apply
any
remedy
the
mischief
grew
worse
the
various
parts
of
his
body
little
by
little
and
he
was
entirely
paralysed
what
a
change
in
his
life
poor
bartholomew
who
had
been
so
proud
of
his
beauty
now
weak
brokendown
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
unable
any
more
to
associate
with
his
friends
was
obliged
to
keep
in
his

shop
all
day
long
he
was
deeply
distressed
not
only
by
the
severe
pains
he
suffered
but
more
by
the
sight
of
his
deformity
sitting
near
the
window
he
had
no
other
amusement
than
to
watch
the
and
his
temper
being
still
the
same
or
rather
soured
by
his
misfortunes
he
was
not
sparing
of
his
sarcasms
one
day
seeing
one
of
the
evangelicals
passing
before
the
shop
he
began
to
insult
him
and
scoff
at
the
terrible
majesty
of
lutheran
he
called
out
adding
all
sorts
of
taunts
the
christian
stopped
he
was
touched
when
he
saw
the
pitiful
condition
of
the
wretched
individual
who
insulted
him
and
going
up
to
him
said
affectionately
man
why
do
you
mock
at
the
do
you
not
see
that
god
has
your

in
this
way
in

to
straighten
your
these
simple
words
struck
milon
he
had
never
thought
that
his
was
as
well
as
his
body
it
be
true
he
asked
god
has
made
these
misfortunes
fall
upon
me
in
order
to
reform
his
misguided
creature
he
lent
an
ear
to
the
lutheran
who
spoke
with
him
and
gave
him
a
new
testament
saying
at
this
book
and
a
few
days
hence
you
will
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
milon
took
the
gospel
opened
it
and
having
begun
says
the
chronicler
taste
the
fruit
of
this
reading
he
continued
at
it
night
and
day
this
little
volume
was
enough
for
him
he
had
no
need
of
any
teacher
the
sword
of
the
word
of
god
pierced
to
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
his
past
life
terrified
him
but
the
gospel
consoled
him
was
to
him
like
a
loud
trumpet
sounding
the
praise
of
the
grace
of
christ
milon
found
the
saviour
has
been
shown
me
he
said
order
that
the
love
of
god
which
pardons
the
greatest
sinners
should
be
placed
as
on
a
hill
and
be
seen
by
all
the
world
he
had
now
a
curb
that
restrained
him
and
prevented
him
from
in
abuse
quarrels
bickerings
squabbles
and
contentions
the
wolf
had
become
a
lamb
bartholomew
imparted
the
riches
he
had
found
in
the
book
of
god
to
his
father
to
the
other
members
of
his
family
and
to
all
the
customers
who
visited
the
shoemaker
shop
there
was
not
a
room
in
paris
that
offered
a
spectacle
at
once
so
interesting
and
so
varied
bartholomew
christian
charity
became
as
inexhaustible
as
his
worldly
skill
had
once
been
fertile
in
inventing
amusements
he
devoted
entirely
to
god
the
restless
activity
which
he
had
lavished
on
the
world
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
the
poor
young
man
in
the
art
of
writing
would
collect
the
children
of
the
neighbourhood
round
his
bed
and
dictate
to
them
a
few
words
of
the
bible
teaching
them
how
to
form
their
letters
properly
at
other
times
he
thought
of
the
necessities
of
the
poor
and
laboured
diligently
with
his
own
hands
with
aquafortis
on
knives
daggers
and
he
executed
many
unusual
things
for
the
goldsmiths
he
spent
the
proceeds
of
his
labour
in
supporting
several
needy
persons
who
possessed
a
knowledge
of
the
gospel
he
had
also
a
fine
voice
and
played
on
several
instruments
singular
grace
accordingly
every
morning
and
evening
he
consecrated
to
the
praise
of
the
lord
those
gifts
which
he
had
formerly
dedicated
to
pleasure
accompanying
himself
as
he
sang
psalms
and
spiritual
songs
people
came
from
all
quarters
to
this
shop
which
was
situated
in
the
centre
of
paris
some
came
reason
of
the
excellent
and
rare
things
he
did
others
him
to
hear
his
singing
a
large
number
were
attracted
by
the
great
and
sudden
change
that
had
taken
place
in
him
god
has
bestowed
these
gifts
on
me
said
the
poor
paralytic
is
to
the
end
that
his
glory
should
be
magnified
in
me
he
meekly
taught
the
humble
to
receive
the
gospel
and
if
any
hypocrites
presented
themselves
took
them
aside
and
launched
on
them
the
thunderbolts
of
god
short
adds
the
chronicler
room
was
a
true
school
of
piety
day
and
night
with
the
glory
of
the
lord
sidenote
du
bourg
and
valeton
at
some
distance
from
this
spot
but
near
de
la
forge
at
the
entrance
of
the
rue
denis
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
was
a
large
draper
shop
the
belonging
to
john
du
bourg
this
tradesman
was
a
man
of
independent
character
who
liked
to
see
to
understand
and
to
judge
for
himself
he
had
never
frequented
the
schools
or
even
had
much
conversation
with
the
evangelicals
but
for
all
that
says
the
chronicle
he
had
not
been
denied
the
wisdom
from
heaven
by
means
of
the
holy
scriptures
which
he
read
constantly
and
in
which
he
humbly
sought
the
truth
he
had
received
from
god
the
knowledge
of
those
tidings
which
as
it
was
said
the
wise
can
not
obtain
by
their
own
wisdom
forthwith
he
had
begun
to
spread
it
around
him
with
an
unwearying
activity
which
astonished
his
neighbours
ardour
which
makes
a
great
show
at
the
beginning
said
some
of
his
relatives
soon
end
in
smoke
like
a
fire
of
tow
as
the
proverb
says
they
were
mistaken
the
word
had
sunk
into
his
heart
and
taken
such
deep
root
there
that
it
could
not
be
plucked
out
the
priests
had
intrigued
kinsfolk
had
clamoured
and
customers
had
deserted
him
but
money
nor
kindred
could
ever
turn
him
aside
from
the
truth
while
his
old
friends
were
growing
distant
new
ones
were
drawing
near
him
a
receiver
of
nantes
peter
valeton
by
name
was
often
seen
entering
his
shop
like
du
bourg
he
was
man
of
sense
and
credit
but
while
the
tradesman
had
been
instructed
in
solitude
by
the
holy
ghost
the
receiver
had
come
to
a
knowledge
of
the
gospel
means
of
some
good
people
with
whom
he
associated
and
then
the
study
of
the
new
testament
had
confirmed
his
faith
he
did
not
stop
here
being
in
easy
circumstances
and
fond
of
books
he
bought
all
the
writings
of
the
reformers
he
could
procure
if
there
was
one
in
any
back
shop
he
would
catch
it
up
pay
for
it
instantly
hide
it
under
his
cloak
for
fear
the
volume
should
be
seen
and
hurry
home
with
it
on
reaching
his
room
he
would
place
it
at
the
bottom
of
a
large
chest
or
trunk
the
key
of
which
he
always
carried
with
him
then
as
soon
as
he
had
a
spare
moment
he
would
close
his
door
reopen
the
chest
take
out
the
precious
book
and
read
it
eagerly
he
listened
if
any
person
was
coming
for
though
he
was
a
faithful
soul
he
was
still
weak
in
the
faith
and
was
afraid
of
the
stake
all
these
pious
men
joyfully
welcomed
those
who
showed
any
love
for
the
gospel
there
was
sometimes
present
at
their
meetings
a
picard
gentleman
by
name
john

belonging
to
the
household
of
the
amirale

celebrated
favourite

him
into

service
and
only
left
him
to
enter
madame
de
bonnivet
family
as
tutor
to
her
three
sons
constantly
attending
the
meetings
of
the
little
church
he
often
spoke
at
them
and
every
one
appreciated
his
knowledge
of
scripture
he
could
read
them
in
hebrew
his
sound
theology
and
his
talent
in
expounding
the
truth
we
shall
meet
with
him
again
in
switzerland
sidenote
giulio
camillo
another
rather
singular
person
attracted
the
attention
of
the
assembly
by
his
dark
complexion
his
gloomy
look
and
mysterious
air
he
was
a
celebrated
italian
giulio
camillo
of
forli
in
the
states
of
the
church
philosopher
orator
poet
astrologer
philologist
and
mythologist
of
great
skill
in
the
cabalistic
science
who
pretended
to
hold
intercourse
with
the
elementary
beings
and
had
laboured
forty
years
in
constructing
a
machine
in
the
form
of
a
theatre
full
of
little
niches
in
which
he
lodged
all
our
faculties
and
many
other
things
besides
and
by
means
of
which
he
pretended
to
teach
all
the
sciences
francis
having
invited
him
to
paris
camillo
exhibited
to
him
and
explained
his
wonderful
machine
at
which
the
king
was
delighted
and
gave
him
ducats
although
taciturn
and
dreamy
he
courted
the
society
of
pious
men
paleario
speaks
of
him
in
his
letters
and
he
became
intimate
in
paris
with
sturm
who
willingly
received
into
his
house
the
learned
of
all
countries
the
latter
was
charmed
to
see
a
scholar
invited
from
italy
by
the
king
and
of
whom
all
the
world
was
talking
inclining
towards
the
gospel
and
one
day
writing
to
bucer
he
said
professes
not
only
profound
science
but
admirable
piety
also
god
often
does
something
by
means
of
men
of
this
sort
who
when
their
will
is
equal
to
their
means
become
great
patterns
camillo
knocked
at
the
door
and
came
in
while
sturm
was
writing
sturm
showed
him
the
letter
and
the
italian
wrote
at
the
foot
to
god
that
my
mind
were
in
my
hands
or
that
it
could
flow
from
my
pen
if
you
could
see
it
you
would
certainly
recognise
it
as
your
own
it
would
appear
that
camillo
was
deceived
he
was
a
man
of
original
mind
desirous
of
learning
everything
new
including
the
reformation
but
there
was
some
quackery
in
him
if
his
famous
machine
did
nothing
for
the
progress
of
science
it
advanced
his
fortunes
which
was
a
compensation
in
his
eyes
calvin
was
less
pleased
with
him
than
sturm
the
eagle
eye
of
the
reformer
was
not
deceived
the
gloomy
air
seemed
to
hide
some
unbelief
or
heresy
spiritual
joy

we
shall
have
to

many
of
them
among

and

besides
these
adult
laymen
a
number
of
scholars
or
students
was
observed
at
the
evangelical
meetings
among
them
was
a
boy
of
melun
jacques
amyot
by
name
very
low
origin
says
beza
picked
up
in
the
streets
of
paris
by
a
lady
who
wishing
to
turn
him
to
account
made
him
attend
her
sons
to
college
and
carry
their
books
amyot
who
was
to
be
one
of
the
most
celebrated
writers
of
the
age
soon
showed
a
wonderful
aptitude
for
greek
literature
he
had
even
learnt
to
know
something
of
the
gospel
he
was
to
change
hereafter
to
take
orders
to
forget
what
he
had
learnt
and
even
to
become
very
wretched
persecutor
but
at
this
time
he
was
considered
to
be
a
friend
of
the
new
doctrine
it
was
the
common
people
however
that
were
most
numerous
at
these
conventicles
one
of
them
henry
poille
a
poor
bricklayer
from
a
village
near
meaux
told
a
friend
one
day
he
had
come
to
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
in
the
school
of
meaux
thanks
to
bishop
briçonnet
alas
he
added
bishop
has
been
overcome
since
then
by
the
enemies
of
the
cross
even
the
most
necessitous
persons
were
active
in
good
works
a
poor
woman
named
catelle
had
turned
out
of
love
for
children
would
be
too
cruel
a
thing
she
said
exclude
those
of
tender
age
from
god
grace
but
of
all
these
evangelical
christians
of
paris
no
one
had
more
zeal
than
de
la
forge
never
spared
his
goods
for
the
poor
says
the
chronicler
he
had
the
bible
printed
at
his
own
expense
and
along
with
the
alms
which
he
distributed
he
would
always
add
a
kind
word
and
often
a
gospel
or
some
other
pious
book
sidenote
a
characteristic
of
calvin
calvin
was
not
however
equally
pleased
with
everything
in
paris
he
willingly
recognised
the
beauty
of
the
city
but
was
terrified
at
seeing
fearful
abysses
and
as
he
called
them
depths
of
hell
side
by
side
with
its
magnificent
palaces
he
felt
sadness
at
the
sight
an
immense
movement
was
then
being
accomplished
all
over
the
world
as
the
sun
of
spring
brings
up
the
seed
sown
in
the
tares
as
well
as
the
good
sun
of
liberty
that
was
beginning
to
shine
quickened
not
only
the
germs
of
truth
but
sometimes
also
those
of
error
calvin
soul
was
deeply
grieved
at
this
but
he
did
not
stand
still
he
had
received
from
god
the
call
to
oppose
all
false
doctrines
and
was
preparing
to
do
so
this
is
one
of
the
main
features
of
his
character
to
the
very
last
he
combated
the
pride
of
those
who
wish
to
know
everything
the
rage
for
subtleties
mystical
pretensions
immorality
unitarian
doctrines
the
deism
which
denies
the
supernatural
and
the
pantheistic
and
atheistic
theories
in
paris
he
met
with
all
these
aberrations
his
principal
means
of
combating
error
was
to
put
forward
the
truth
yet
he
thought
it
useful
sometimes
to
have
conversations
and
even
conferences
with
his
adversaries
of
which

willingly
received
all
pious
strangers
visiting

one
day
calvin
saw
at
his
friend
table
certain
individuals
who
he
fancied
had
something
singular
about
them
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
them
and
he
tried
to
make
them
out
one
of
them
named
coppin
from
lille
a
man
of
the
people
and
of
no
education
but
with
boldness
greater
than
his
ignorance
raised
his
voice
affected
a
sententious
style
and
spoke
like
an
oracle
said
calvin
fool
never
has
any
doubts
a
little
farther
on
sat
quintin
from
hainault
who
seemed
to
have
more
education
and
certainly
more
cunning
he
assumed
airs
of
superiority
an
imposing
tone
of
voice
and
expressing
himself
ambiguously
gave
himself
the
air
of
a
prophet
latter
seems
to
me
a
big
rogue
said
calvin
of
him
quintin
was
usually
accompanied
by
a
few
disciples
ignorant
and
fanatical
persons
who
repeated
all
he
said
they
were
bertrand
des
moulins
claude
perceval
and
others
these
bold
and
adventurous
sectarians
having
nothing
and
never
working
looked
out
wherever
they
went
for
some
person
who
would
keep
them
in
their
idleness
by
supplying
them
with
victuals
and
drink
they
crept
into
the
house
by
meek
enticing
ways
making
no
display
at
first
of
their
particular
doctrines
reserving
these
for
the
initiated
only
they
strove
to
win
over
all
who
listened
to
them
and
to
that
end
spoke
continually
of
the
holy
ghost
and
tried
to
make
men
believe
that
they
were
his
apostles
simple
souls
allowed
themselves
to
be
caught
they
would
have
believed
they
had
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
if
they
had
not
looked
upon
these
people
as
saints
sidenote
the
spirituals
or
libertines
one
day
when
there
was
a
large
party
at
de
la
forge
quintin
began
to
publish
his
doctrines
whatever
was
the
subject
of
conversation
the
immediately
appeared
calvin
lost
all
patience
are
like
those
country
priests
he
said
having
but
one
image
in
their
church
make
it
serve
for
five
or
six
saints
he
is
either
james
or
francis
or
st
basil
and
the
priest
receives
as
many
offerings
as
there
are
saints
sometimes
however
these
as
they
were
called
betrayed
themselves
and
let
their
fanatical
opinions
slip
out
are
not
many
spirits
said
quintin
is
only
one
spirit
of
god
who
is
and
lives
in
all
creatures
it
is
this
sole
spirit
which
does
everything
man
has
no
will
no
more
than
if
he
were
a
stone
such
language
surprised
calvin
he
examined
the
strange
prophets
and
discovered
several
capital
errors
in
them
holy
spirit
is
our
reason
said
some
that
spirit
teaches
us
that
there
is
neither
condemnation
nor
hell
soul
said
others
material
and
mortal
is
everything
said
quintin
everything
is
god
immoral
doctrines
were
combined
with
this
system
calvin
conscience
was
terrified
he
had
risen
up
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
a
framework
that
men
had
built
round
the
temple
of
god
and
now
rash
hands
were
presuming
to
destroy
the
temple
itself
he
wished
to
destroy
the
superstitious
traditions
of
so
many
ages
only
to
set
the
divine
truths
of
the
apostolic
times
in
their
place
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
men
who
desired
no
other
god
but
nature
and
would
change
the
world
into
a
vast
wilderness
calvin
did
not
separate
from
rome
in
order
to
be
less
christian
but
to
be
more
so
he
resolved
therefore
to
attack
those
who
under
the
cloak
of
protestantism
suppress
the
mysteries
of
faith
to
combat
with
the
same
severity
both
pope
and
sectarians
and
if
he
undertook
to
destroy
the
fables
of
men
he
would
try
still
more
to
preserve
the
revelations
of
god
had
not
luther
cried
out
when
speaking
of
these
spirituals
is
the
devil
who
seeks
to
turn
you
aside
from
the
truth
turn
your
backs
upon
the
drivellers
various
circumstances
which
were
then
taking
place
under
calvin
eyes
made
him
understand
more
clearly
the
necessity
of
opposing
these
threatening
doctrines
with
the
utmost
energy
sidenote
a
murder
and
a
theft
one
day
a
man
had
been
murdered
in
the
streets
of
paris
a
great
crowd
had
gathered
round
his
body
and
a
pious
christian
exclaimed
who
has
committed
this
crime
quintin
who
was
there
also
made
answer
immediately
in
his
picard
you
want
to
know
it
was
the
other
said
to
him
with
surprise
could
you
be
such
a
coward
was
not
me
it
was
god
exclaimed
the
man
impute
to
god
a
crime
which
he
punishes
then
the
wretched
man
his
poison
more
copiously
continued
it
thee
it
me
it

for
what
thee
or
me
does
it
is
god
who
does
it
and
what
god
does
we
do
another
analogous
circumstance
occurred
in
the
house
of
calvin
friend
de
la
forge
had
a
servant
to
whom
he
paid
high
wages
this
man
robbed
his
master
and
ran
away
with
the
money
a
shoemaker
of
the
neighbourhood
who
held
quintin
opinions
having
gone
to
the
shop
the
same
day
found
the
tradesman
very
uneasy
man
who
has
committed
such
a
base
action
he
said
easily
take
advantage
of
my
credit
and
borrow
in
my
name
whereupon
as
calvin
relates
the
shoemaker
immediately
began
to
flap
his
wings
and
was
up
into
the
clouds
exclaiming
is
blaspheming
god
to
call
this
action
base
seeing
that
god
does
everything
we
ought
to
reckon
nothing
bad
some
days
later
this
philosopher
was
himself
robbed
by
a
servant
immediately
forgetting
all
his
spiritual
knowledge
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
a
madman
to
search
after
the
thief
and
on
reaching
de
la
forge
was
lavish
of
his
abuse
against
the
culprit
de
la
forge
ironically
repeated
to
him
his
own
words
you
accuse
god
he
said
it
is
he
who
did
it
the
shoemaker
sneaked
of
abashed
a
dog
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
sidenote
false
liberty
of
the
spirituals
calvin
began
the
contest
it
was
not
with
philosophy
or
speculation
or
apologetics
that
he
fought
these
pretended
spiritualists
said
he
us
sufficiently
in
scripture
it
is
our
want
of
knowing
them
thoroughly
that
is
the
cause
and
source
of
all
errors
he
attacked
quintin
and
pressed
him
hard
he
quoted
the
commandments
of
god
against
theft
and
murder
call
god
impure
he
said
thief
and
a
robber
and
you
add
that
there
is
no
harm
in
it
who
i
pray
has
condemned
impurity
theft
murder
if
god
has
not
quintin

was
generally
very
liberal
with
passages
from
scripture

with
a
smile

not

because
you
do
not
understand

said
understand
it
a
little
better
than
you

retorted
calvin
i
see
pretty
plainly
that
you
desire
to
mislead
the
world
by
absurd
and
dangerous
trifling
the
were
by
turns
protestant
or
catholic
as
suited
them
their
manner
of
seeing

very
well
with
their
pantheism
and
they
would
have
been
quite
as
much
at
their
ease
among
the
hindoos
and
the
turks
this
broadness
which
misled
the
moderate
party
offended
calvin
one
day
when
quintin
said
with
unction
am
just
come
from
a
solemn
mass
celebrated
by
a
cardinal
i
have
seen
the
glory
of

you
said
calvin
rather
coarsely
your
opinion
a
canon
ought
to
continue
in
his
luxury
and
a
monk
in
his
convent
like
a
pig
in
a
sty
the
pantheists
made
proselytes
dint
of
intrigue
and
flattery
they
attracted
the
simple
ignorant
poor
whom
they
made
as
lazy
as
themselves
they
tried
to
make
way
with
the
learned
and
the
great
and
even
to
creep
into
the
hearts
of
princes
their
high
pretensions
to
spirituality
staggered
weak
minds
and
the
convenient
principle
by
which
every
man
ought
to
remain
in
the
church
to
which
he
belonged
even
were
it
sunk
in
error
made
timid
and
irresolute
characters
lean
to
their
side
a
priest
who
had
become
quintin
head
champion
succeeded
in
deceiving
the
excellent
bucer
by
means
of
the
false
appearance
he
put
on
and
ten
years
later
an
elect
soul
margaret
was
dazzled
and
deceived
by
their
hypocritical
spirituality
about
were
led
astray
in
france
calvin
was
not
one
of
those
individuals
remain
in
doubt
and
suspense
from
the
very
first
he
detected
pantheism
and
materialism
under
the
veils
with
which
these
men
sought
from
time
to
time
to
conceal
their
errors
and
boldly
pointed
them
out
his
uprightness
and
frankness
presented
a
very
striking
contrast
to
their
dissimulation
and
cunning
turn
their
cloak
inside
out
at
every
moment
he
said
that
you
do
not
know
where
to
hold
them
one
of
the
principal
articles
of
their
creed
is
that
men
ought
to
counterfeit
whilst
even
the
heathens
have
said
that
it
is
better
to
be
a
lion
than
a
fox
he
found
that
their
doctrines
were
impious
and
revolutionary
to
confound
god
with
the
world
was
he
thought
to
take
from
the
world
the
living
personal
god
who
is
present
in
the
midst
of
us
and
consequently
to
expose
not
only
the
reformation
and
christianity
but
the
whole
social
system
to
utter
ruin
the
conduct
of
these
pretended
was
already
sufficient
in
his
eyes
to
characterise
and
condemn
their
system
has
metamorphosed
quintin
and
his
companions
from
tailors
into
teachers
said
calvin
that
preferring
to
be
well
fed
and
at
their
ease
to
working
they
find
it
convenient
to
gain
their
living
by
prating
as
priests
and
monks
do
by
chanting
it
was
not
until
later
that
calvin
wrote
his
excellent
treatise
against
the
libertines
but
says
theodore
beza
was
then
during
his
stay
in
paris
that
he
first
encountered
those
teachers
who
revived
in
our
times
the
detestable
sect
of
the
carpocratians
abolishing
all
difference
between
good
and
evil
he
encountered
a
probably
still
more
dangerous
doctrine
sidenote
servetus
about
that
time
a
stranger
whose
proceedings
were
rather
mysterious
used
to
appear
at
rare
intervals
in
the
little
circles
of
paris
many
persons
spoke
highly
of
him
they
said
he
could
not
be
reproached
with
any
immoral
tendencies
while
his
subtle
understanding
his
brilliant
genius
his
profound
knowledge
of
natural
science
and
his
fiery
imagination
seemed
as
if
they
would
make
him
one
of
the
most
surprising
and
influential
leaders
of
the
epoch
this
was
michael
servetus
a
man
of
the
same
age
as
calvin
born
at
villenueva
in
arragon
he
had
studied
the
law
at
toulouse
and
afterwards
published
a
daring
work
entitled
the
errors
of
the
he
put
himself
forward
as
a
teacher
of
truth
and
a
thorough
reformer
the
great
mysteries
of
faith
were
to
give
way
to
a
certain
pantheism
enveloped
in
mystical
and
sabellian
forms
it
was
not
alone
which
he
desired
to
reform
but
the
evangelical
reformation
also
substituting
for
its
scriptural
and
practical
character
a
philosophic
and
rationalistic
tendency
in
order
to
accomplish
this
transformation
of
protestantism
servetus
began
by
associating
with
the
reformers
of
german
switzerland
and
of
germany
œcolampadius
having
examined
him
declared
that
he
could
not
count
him
a
christian
unless
he
acknowledged
the
son
as
partaking
through
all
eternity
of
the
real
godhead
of
the
father
melanchthon
was
alarmed
at
hearing
his
doctrines
imagination
is
confused
he
said
ideas
are
obscure
he
possesses
many
marks
of
a
fanatical
spirit
he
raves
on
the
subjects
of
justification
and
the
trinity
o
god
what
tragedies
this
question
will
occasion
among
our
posterity
we
may
easily
understand
the
painful
impression
servetus
made
on
these
two
men
the
most
tolerant
of
the
sixteenth
century
he
was
as
we
have
said
a
mystic
rationalist
but
rationalism
and
protestantism
which
many
persons
confound
together
are
two
opposite
poles
nothing
excited
the
indignation
of
the
reformers
more
than
this
pride
of
human
reason
which
pretends
unaided
to
explain
god
and
to
accomplish
without
his
help
the
moral
renovation
of
man
the
spanish
doctor
finding
himself
thus
rejected
by
the
german
divines
quitted
those
parts
sore
vexed
and
exclaiming
the
lord
confound
all
the
tyrants
of
the
church
amen
he
went
to
paris
under
the
name
of
michael
de
villeneuve
servetus
had
an
object
in
going
to
france
if
he
succeeded
in
planting
his
standard
in
that
mighty
country
near
that
university
which
had
been
for
so
many
ages
the
queen
of
intelligence
his
triumph
he
thought
would
be
secure
he
willingly
left
germany
to
the
germans
that
french
nation
which
has
the
prerogative
of
universality
which
succeeds
in
everything
which
is
so
intelligent
so
frank
so
communicative
so
practical
and
so
will
select
to
be
the
organ
of
the
second
reformation
servetus
thought
the
french
reformers
more
daring
than
those
of
saxony
he
had
heard
of
a
young
doctor
of
great
ability
who
desired
to
carry
the
reform
farther
than
luther
and
he
thought
he
had
found
his
man
but
he
was
mistaken
that
man
was
far
above
his
empty
theories
sidenote
calvin
and
servetus
on
the
trinity
calvin
could
not
and
would
not
have
any
other
god
than
him
who
gives
us
life
who
has
ransomed
us
and
who
sanctifies
father
god
above
us
the
son
god
for
us
the
holy
ghost
god
in
us
this
threefold
relation
with
god
which
scripture
revealed
to
him
and
which
entirely
satisfied
his
inward
longings
forced
him
to
recognise
a
in
god
but
on
the
other
hand
being
essential
to
the
deity
he
was
bound
to
maintain
it
at
any
cost
and
he
thus
felt
himself
constrained
to
embrace
the
idea
of
a
divine
trinity
against
this
doctrine
servetus
levelled
his
bitterest
sarcasms
the
spaniard
rejected
what
he
denominated
an
trinity
he
called
those
who
believed
in
it
or
even
atheists
and
abused
them
in
coarse
language
is
man
he
said
godhead
was
communicated
to
him
by
grace
but
he
is
not
god
by
nature
the
father
alone
is
god
in
that
sense
he
invited
calvin
to
a
conference
puffed
up
and
charmed
with
his
own
system
he
fancied
himself
certain
to
convince
the
reformer
and
flattered
himself
with
the
hope
of
making
him
his
the
task
was
not
an
easy
one
the
object
of
the
reformation
was
to
raise
a
spiritual
temple
wherein
troubled
souls
might
find
a
refuge
and
calvin
saw
rash
hands
presuming
to
make
it
a
receptacle
for
every
error
and
in
his
own
energetic
language
den
for
murdering
souls
he
stood
forth
therefore
to
maintain
the
apostolic
doctrine
and
contended
that
christ
who
called
himself
the
son
of
god
was
a
not
like
believers
in
consequence
of
adoption
not
like
the
angels
because
of
their
communion
with
the
lord
but
in
the
proper
sense
and
that
if
the
son
of
a
man
has
the
nature
of
a
man
like
his
father
jesus
the
only
son
of
god
has
in
like
manner
the
nature
of
god
it
was
a
question
that
seriously
occupied
many
minds
at
this
period
servetus
did
not
stand
alone
other
doctors
as
hetzer
denck
campanus
and
joris
had
professed
analogous
errors
one
universal
cry
was
heard
among
the
reformers
when
they
saw
christ
divinity
attacked
luther
had
declared
that
little
spark
would
cause
a
great
conflagration
zwingle
had
demanded
that
false
wicked
and
pernicious
doctrine
should
be
opposed
by
every
means
and
even
the
moderate
bucer
forgetting
his
christian
gentleness
had
gone
so
far
as
to
declare
from
the
pulpit
that
man
like
servetus
deserved
to
have
his
bowels
plucked
out
and
his
body
torn
to
pieces
calvin
resolved
to
accept
servetus
invitation
these
two
young
men
born
in
the
same
year
gifted
each
of
them
with
marvellous
genius
unshakeable
in
their
convictions
are
about
to
enter
the
lists
what
blows
they
will
deal
each
other
what
a
struggle
which
will
come
off
conqueror
if
luther
zwingle
and
bucer
are
so
animated
what
will
calvin
be
he
was
the
one
who
showed
the
most
moderate
sentiments
with
regard
to
servetus
alas
why
did
he
not
continue
so
to
the
last
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
cure
servetus
he
said
i
show
myself
in
public
i
know
that
i
expose
my
life
but
i
will
spare
no
pains
to
bring
him
to
such
sentiments
that
pious
men
may
be
able
to
take
him
affectionately
by
the
justice
requires
that
we
should
take
account
of
these
feelings
of
calvin
with
regard
to
servetus
sidenote
a
discussion
appointed
the
discussion
was
therefore
resolved
upon
and
a
certain
number
of
friends
were
invited
to
be
present
the
time
and
place
were
settled
and
when
the
day
arrived
calvin
quitted
de
la
forge
house
and
proceeding
down
the
rue
martin
to
the
rue
antoine
found
himself
at
the
appointed
hour
at
a
house
in
this
latter
street
which
had
been
selected
for
the
colloquy
servetus
had
not
come
and
calvin
waited
for
him
still
the
spaniard
did
not
appear
and
the
frenchman
was
patient
what
was
the
cause
of
his
delay
had
morin
obtained
information
of
the
meeting
and
was
he
preparing
to
catch
the
two
young
leaders
by
one
cast
of
his
net
after
waiting
for
some
time
to
no
purpose
calvin
withdrew
servetus
who
lived
as
a
catholic
in
the
midst
of
catholics
and
made
no
scruple
of
taking
part
in
the
worship
of
the
roman
church
probably
feared
that
a
public
discussion
with
calvin
would
make
him
known
and
expose
him
to
serious
danger
servetus
challenge
was
not
however
without
consequences
he
had
called
calvin
into
the
lists
he
had
made
him
the
champion
of
the
doctrine
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
the
opportunity
of
answering
this
challenge
occurred
twenty
years
later
at
geneva
if
the
struggle
had
then
been
confined
to
a
learned
discussion
between
these
two
great
minds
it
would
have
been
right
enough
servetus
himself
had
challenged
it
but
the
ideas
of
the
times
from
which
calvin
even
while
seeking
a
relaxation
in
the
form
could
not
free
himself
led
to
one
of
those
distressing
calamities
so
frequent
during
a
long
series
of
ages
in
the
annals
of
rome
but
of
which
god
be
thanked
there
is
only
this
one
instance
in
those
of
the
reformation
calvin
did
not
fight
only
with
the
tongue
he
was
then
hurrying
on
the
printing
of
his
first
theological
work
it
was
the
book
written
against
those
who
said
the
soul
was
only
the
motion
of
the
lungs
and
that
if
it
had
been
endowed
with
immortality
at
the
creation
it
had
been
deprived
of
it
by
the
fall
us
put
down
those
people
he
said
murder
souls
without
appearing
to
inflict
any
wounds
and
with
this
view
he
had
composed
a
work
on
the
of
the
the
title
given
it
in
a
letter
he
wrote
to
fabri
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
he
afterwards
substituted
the
rather
awkward
one
of
night
or
sleep
of
the
soul
as
the
first
indicates
the
subject
more
clearly
at
the
same
time
also
he
combated
the
opinion
of
those
men
as
he
calls
them
who
believed
that
the
soul
slept
until
the
the
first
edition
of
this
work
which
bears
the
date
of
paris
came
out
probably
immediately
after
calvin
had
left
that
city
or
shortly
before
his
departure
sidenote
character
of
calvin
divinity
this
work
gave
him
a
place
apart
in
the
ranks
of
the
reformers
in
this
his
earliest
theological
treatise
he
displayed
the
character
that
distinguished
him
and
which
those
who
surrounded
him
had
already
been
able
to
recognise
in
his
conversations
his
theology
would
not
be
negative
but
on
the
contrary
exceedingly
positive
his
first
work
does
not
combat
the
errors
of
rome
he
stands
forth
as
the
defender
of
the
soul
the
advocate
of
christian
spiritualism
he
will
be
as
a
great
historian
has
said
man
called
to
build
the
lord
citadel
of
which
luther
had
laid
the
foundation
the
force
of
conviction
the
weight
of
proof
the
power
with
which
he
employed
the
scriptures
the
simplicity
and
clearness
of
style
struck
every
reader
we
shall
not
speak
here
of
calvin
as
a
writer
we
have
done
so
elsewhere
there
might
however
be
discerned
in
this
work
a
defect
of
which
calvin
never
entirely
cured
himself
it
contained
energetic
disdain
and
bitter
invective
he
saw
this
himself
he
did
more
he
moderated
these
expressions
in
a
second
edition
said
certain
things
in
it
he
wrote
referring
to
the
first
a
bitterness
and
severity
which
may
have
offended
certain
delicate
ears
i
have
therefore
struck
out
some
passages
added
others
and
changed
many
this
did
not
prevent
his
falling
into
the
same
fault
again
which
it
must
be
acknowledged
was
that
of
the
age
in
spite
of
his
frequent
discussions
calvin
was
happy
in
the
house
of
de
la
forge
accustomed
to
a
frugal
life
he
was
little
affected
by
the
abundance
of
all
sorts
of
good
things
by
which
he
was
surrounded
but
the
piety
of
the
family
delighted
him
much
he
loved
to
see
the
master
distributing
the
gospel
relieving
the
poor
and
listening
to
the
interpretation
of
god
word
and
took
pleasure
in
his
christian
conversation
assuredly
he
said
happiness
is
not
circumscribed
within
the
narrow
limits
of
this
frail
life
and
yet
god
promises
also
to
believers
a
happy
life
even
in
this
pilgrimage
and
earthly
so
far
as
the
state
of
the
world
permits
but
the
happiness
of
this
blessed
household
was
not
to
be
of
long
duration
morin
was
ere
long
to
enter
it
throw
the
wife
into
prison
lead
the
husband
to
the
scaffold
and
change
the
happiness
of
a
peaceful
christian
family
into
sorrow
groans
and
tears
sidenote
calvin
resolves
to
leave
paris
would
de
la
forge
be
the
only
victim
would
the
first
blows
be
aimed
at
him
would
they
not
be
aimed
at
calvin
the
author
of
that
bold
address
which
had
thrown
both
city
and
university
into
confusion
could
the
friend
of
rector
cop
long
remain
in
the
capital
without
once
more
exciting
the
attention
of
his
enemies
a
great
persecution
was
about
to
burst
forth
and
if
calvin
had
been
living
in
the
rue
martin
at
that
time
he
would
doubtless
have
been
seized
along
with
the
pious
tradesman
burnt
like
the
other
martyrs
and
the
history
of
his
life
would
have
shrunk
to
a
paragraph
in
the
simple
annals
of
but
the
father
in
heaven
did
not

that

fall
to

powerful
motives
which
urged
him
to
leave
france
his
time
in
paris
was
so
taken
up
with
visits
interviews
and
other
business
that
he
sank
under
the
burden
without
being
able
to
discharge
what
he
looked
upon
as
his
first
duty
he
was
called
to
be
a
teacher
rather
than
a
mere
preacher
of
the
gospel
to
accomplish
the
great
task
he
had
set
himself
he
needed
repose
leisure
and
study
besides
interviews
and
conferences
with
other
theologians
he
adopted
a
great
resolution

said

some
obscure
corner

to

elsewhere
du
tillet
had
determined
to
accompany
him
the
two
friends
made
their
preparations
they
procured
two
horses
and
two
servants
and
one
day
towards
the
end
of
july
calvin
bade
farewell
to
the
pious
tradesman
who
had
been
as
a
brother
to
him
their
clothes
were
packed
away
in
portmanteaus
in
one
of
which
they
hid
their
money
and
then
they
were
fastened
on
the
crupper
and
so
the
travellers
departed
the
masters
on
horseback
the
servants
on
foot
reaching
the
frontier
says
a
catholic
historian
could
not
restrain
his
emotion
he
lifted
up
his
voice
in
distress
that
france
rejected
the
men
whom
god
sent
her
and
even
tried
to
murder
them
this
exclamation
appears
rather
doubtful
and
the
historian
who
reports
it
is
not
always
accurate
still
it
is
possible
and
not
unnatural
the
travellers
having
entered
lorraine
stopped
at
delme
near
nancy
where
they
halted
and
walked
about
the
town
during
this
time
one
of
their
servants
who
knew
where
the
money
had
been
hidden
took
advantage
of
their
absence
placed
the
valise
on
the
best
of
the
two
horses
and
rode
away
as
fast
as
he
could
when
calvin
and
du
tillet
returned
they
discovered
the
robbery
they
wished
to
pursue
the
thief
but
could
not
catch
him
the
two
friends
were
greatly
embarrassed
when
the
other
servant
approached
and
offered
them
ten
crowns
which
he
had
with
him
they
accepted
his
offer
and
were
able
to
reach
strasburg
if
calvin
had
remained
in
his
own
country
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
fulfil
the
career
to
which
he
was
called
he
had
no
other
prospect
but
the
stake
and
yet
he
will
indeed
be
her
reformer
true
he
quitted
her
but
a
divine
hand
fixed
him
as
near
as
possible
to
that
land
of
his
affections

of
his
sorrows

calvin
had
hardly
left
paris
when
the
clouds
gathered
over
the
little
church
of
the
metropolis
was
no
year
says
a
chronicler
of
the
sixteenth
century
speaking
of
such
great
marvels
happened
in
divers
countries
but
of
all
these
marvels
none
is
more
worthy
to
be
remembered
than
that
which
caused
it
to
be
named
year
of
the
the
christians
of
paris
met
together
frequently
in
one
another
houses
lord
said
they
his
disciples
to
go
forth
and
scatter
the
doctrine
of
salvation
into
all
corners
of
the
world
the
hive
was
swarming
as
it
had
recently
done
at
poitiers
le
comte
whom
we
have
mentioned
quitted
his
friends
and
after
many
dangers
reached
morat
to
assist
farel
in
his
evangelical
work
another
lutheran
whose
journey
was
to
be
productive
of
disastrous
results
followed
the
same
road
not
long
after
sidenote
temporisers
and
scripturists
there
were
as
we
have
seen
two
distinct
parties
among
the
evangelical
christians
of
france
the
and
the
they
sometimes
came
in
contact
and
each
of
them
resolutely
defended
their
own
views
the
looked
to
margaret
to
the
king
her
brother
and
to
alliances
with
henry
viii
and
the
protestants
of
germany
knowing
that
francis
detested
the
monks
they
hoped
with
the
help
of
the
du
bellays
to
give
france
a
moderate
reform
and
desired
to
do
nothing
that
might
offend
him
they
waited
as
for
the
that
is
to
say
the
evangelicals
of
the
school
of
calvin
diplomacy
made
them
feel
uneasy
the
king
protection
annoyed
them
and
the
idea
of
recognising
the
bishops
and
the
pope
alarmed
them
they
saw
all
kinds
of
superstition
following
in
the
train
of
the
hierarchy
and
they
were
determined
to
resist
stoutly
everything
that
might
bring
back
the
to
the
temple
of
god
sidenote
feret
sent
to
consult
farel
as
the
two
parties
could
not
come
to
an
understanding
they
determined
to
send
one
of
their
number
to
switzerland
in
order
to
obtain
the
opinion
of
farel
and
the
other
refugees
should
they
wait
or
should
they
act
was
the
question
they
put
they
selected
for
that
consultation
a
simple
pious
intelligent
christian
by
name
feret
who
belonged
to
the
royal
pharmacy
he
accepted
the
mission
and
departed
no
one
suspected
at
that
time
that
this
journey
would
lead
to
an
explosion
that
would
shake
the
capital
terrify
france
and
perhaps
destroy
the
cause
of
the
reformation
feret
proceeded
to
switzerland
he
had
hardly
crossed
the
jura
when
a
striking
spectacle
met
his
eyes
everything
was
in
commotion
as
in
a
hive
of
bees
farel
viret
saunier
olivetan
froment
marcourt
hollard
le
comte
and
others
besides
coming
from
dauphiny
basle
paris
strasburg
or
belonging
to
the
country
were
boldly
preaching
the
evangelical
doctrine
everywhere
at
neufchatel
all
had
been
removed
from
public
worship
and
the
same
had
been
done
at
aigle
and
in
its
four
orbe
grandson
and
the
pays
de
vaud
were
beginning
to
make
up
their
minds
geneva
was
tottering
the
old
waldenses
of
piedmont
were
holding
out
their
hands
to
the
new
reformers
in
many
places
they
were
even
the
altars
and
breaking
down
the
images
according
to
the
command
in
deuteronomy
what
a
contrast
with
the
timid
precautions
of
the
christians
of
paris
feret
was
quite
struck
with
it
and
that
alone
was
an
answer
he
explained
to
the
christians
to
whom
he
was
accredited
the
very
different
state
of
things
at
paris
he
described
the
difficulties
of
france
and
the
two
parties
that
existed
among
the
reformed
and
asked
for
their
advice
farel
and
his
friends
held
that
a
subject
ought
not
to
rise
in
rebellion
against
his
lord
but
if
the
king
of
france
commanded
anything
forbidden
by
the
king
of
heaven
it
was
necessary
to
obey
him
who
was
the
master
of
the
other
these
decided
christians
rejected
all
those
medleys
of
the
gospel
and
popery
that
francis
margaret
of
navarre
du
bellay
and
even
melanchthon
as
it
was
said
desired
two
the
gospel
and
the
pope
can
not
exist
together
they
said
more
than
fire
and
water
the
mass
especially
that
main
point
of
the
romish
doctrine
must
in
their
opinion
be
abolished
if
the
papal
hierarchy
was
the
tree
whose
deadly
shade
killed
the
living
seeds
of
the
word
the
mass
was
its
root
it
must
be
plucked
up
and
thus
prevented
from
stretching
its
fatal
branches
any
longer
over
the
wide
field
of
christendom
the
writing
and
posting
of
placards
were
proposed
what
indeed
could
be
done
oppression
kept
the
boldest
voices
silent
it
was
necessary
to
draw
up
an
energetic
protest
against
error
and
place
it
at
the
same
moment
if
possible
before
the
eyes
of
all
france
farel
undertook
the
task
he
could
not
write
without
making
use
of
trenchant
style
and
thundering
eloquence
he
reflected
on
the
evils
that
afflicted
his
country
indignation
guided
his
daring
pen
his
style
was
uneven
harsh
perhaps
but
masculine
nervous
and
full
of
fire
at
length
the
evangelical
protest
was
written
and
farel
laid
it
before
his
brethren
who
accepted
it
believing
that
it
would
be
a
hammer
that
breaketh
the
rock
in
the
document
was
taken
to
the
printer
and
came
out
in
two
forms
in
placards
to
be
posted
up
against
the
walls
and
little
tracts
that
were
to
be
dropped
in
the
streets
the
sheets
were
packed
up
and
intrusted
to
the
care
of
feret
who
departed
with
the
precious
bales
containing
thunderbolt
forged
on
farel
anvil
no
one
stopped
him
at
the
frontier
he
traversed
burgundy
and
champagne
without
difficulty
and
arrived
in
paris
sidenote
discussion
about
the
placards
the
evangelical
christians
of
the
capital
impatient
to
receive
news
from
switzerland
assembled
hastily
and
feret
laid
the
placard
before
them
those
energetic
words
written
at
the
foot
of
the
jura
seemed
strangely
bold
when
they
were
read
under
the
walls
of
the
sorbonne
and
at
the
gates
of
the
louvre
that
brave
and
pious
minister
courault
came
forward
in
the
meeting
as
the
organ
of
the
of
judgment
as
they
were
afterwards
called
us
beware
of
posting
up
these
placards
he
said
shall
only
inflame
the
rage
of
our
adversaries
thereby
and
increase
the
dispersion
of
believers
but
on
the
other
hand
those
who
were
alarmed
at
the
steps
taken
by
francis
to
unite
the
pope
and
the
gospel
were
delighted
us
be
cautious
of
so
squaring
our
prudence
they
said
it
does
not
make
us
act
like
cowards
if
we
look
timidly
from
one
side
to
the
other
to
see
how
far
we
can
go
without
exposing
our
lives
we
shall
forsake
jesus
christ
in
their
view
it
was
of
importance
to
confess
the
lord
in
the
sight
of
france
and
in
order
to
do
so
they
were
ready
like
the
martyrs
of
old
to
encounter
death
many
of
the
opposite
party
gave
way
and
the
publication
of
the
placard
was
resolved
on
these
sincere
christians
were
so
firmly
convinced
of
the
divinity
of
their
doctrine
and
so
full
of
faith
that
they
expected
an
intervention
from
a
miraculous
one
indeed
but
an
extraordinary
rushing
mighty
wind
from
heaven
and
tongues
like
as
of
fire
which
should
kindle
all
hearts
they
thought
that
god
would
by
this
declaration
open
to
france
the
gate
of
his
spiritual
treasures
the
consultation
continued
where
should
they
circulate
this
paper
asked
some
over
paris
was
the
reply
over
france
answered
others
they
were
not
unknown
individuals
who
deliberated
thus
the
wealthy
tradesman
du
bourg
and
his
friends
were
there
and
if
bartholomew
milon
could
not
act
at
least
he
gave
advice
which
was
to
cost
him
dear
the
warmest
friends
of
the
reformation
shared
the
work
between
them
each
man
had
his
district
his
province
portioned
out
the
kingdom
in
order
to
do
same
in
every
says
the
catholic
fontaine
and
the
night
of
the
of
october
was
appointed
for
this
daring
enterprise
the
placards
were
divided
among
those
who
were
to
post
them
up
or
to
distribute
them
knowing
that
unless
god
made
the
truth
enter
into
the
heart
they
would
do
nothing
but
the
air
in
these
pious
men
exhorted
one
another
to
to
god
with
fervent
zeal
then
every
man
returned
home
carrying
with
him
a
bundle
of
placards
and
a
parcel
of
tracts
sidenote
the
placards
posted
up
when
the
night
came
the
selected
men
left
their
houses
carrying
the
printed
sheets
in
their
hands
and
each
one
did
his
duty
in
his
quarter
silently
and
mysteriously
the
fervent
christian
who
thus
hazarded
his
life
took
however
certain
precautions
he
listened
to
hear
if
any
one
were
coming
hastily
stuck
the
bill
on
the
wall
and
then
glided
noiselessly
away
to
some
other
place
where
he
posted
up
another
in
a
short
time
the
streets
and
crossways
were
covered
with
the
evangelical
proclamation
some
being
fixed
even
on
the
walls
of
the
louvre
as
the
day
appeared
most
of
these
daring
men
returned
home
but
others
hid
themselves
and
from
a
distance
watched
to
see
what
would
happen
a
few
persons
began
to
come
out
of
doors
they
went
up
to
the
large
handbills
and
stopped
to
examine
them
gradually
a
crowd
was
formed
some
friars
approached
hundreds
of
persons
of
every
class
collected
round
the
strange
placards
they
were
read
aloud
remarks
were
made
upon
them
and
the
most
diverse
sentiments
were
expressed
many
persons
gave
vent
to
indignation
and
threats
some
approved
the
greater
part
were
astounded
the
crowd
was
particularly
large
in
the
streets
of
denis
and
honoré
in
the
place
royale
in
the
city
at
the
gates
of
the
churches
and
of
the
sorbonne
and
the
louvre
let
us
read
this
terrible
handbill
as
it
was
read
in
the
streets
of
the
capital
the
public
of
our
age
will
find
it
too
severe
and
possibly
too
long
and
we
must
abridge
it
a
little
but
the
men
of
the
sixteenth
century
read
it
to
the
end
and
notwithstanding
its
defects
its
action
was
powerful
like
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
it
made
all
france
tremble
it
began
with
a
solemn
invocation
truthful
articles
concerning
the
horrible
great
and
unbearable
abuses
of
the
popish
mass
invented
directly
against
the
holy
supper
of
our
lord
the
only
mediator
and
only
saviour
jesus
christ
invoke
heaven
and
earth
in
witness
of
the
truth
against
that
proud
and
pompous
popish
mass
for
the
world
if
god
does
not
apply
a
remedy
is
and
will
be
by
it
totally
desolated
ruined
lost
and
undone
seeing
that
in
it
our
lord
is
outrageously
blasphemed
and
the
people
blinded
and
led
astray
which
ought
not
to
be
borne
any
longer
the
first
place
every
believing
christian
ought
to
be
very
certain
that
our
lord
and
only
saviour
jesus
christ
the
great
bishop
and
pastor
ordained
of
god
has
given
his
body
and
soul
his
life
and
blood
for
our
sanctification
by
a
perfect
sacrifice
to
renounce
this
sacrifice
as
if
it
were
insufficient
to
replace
it
by
a
visible
sacrifice
namely
the
mass
as
if
christ
had
not
fully
satisfied
for
us
the
justice
of
his
father
and
as
if
he
were
not
the
saviour
and
mediator
would
be
a
terrible
and
damnable
heresy
world
has
been
and
in
many
places
still
is
filled
with
wretched
who
as
if
they
were
our
redeemers
set
themselves
in
christ
place
and
pretend
to
offer
an
acceptable
sacrifice
to
god
for
the
salvation
both
of
the
living
and
the
dead
do
not
these
people
make
the
apostles
and
evangelists
liars
and
do
they
not
even
belie
themselves
since
they
chant
every
sunday
at
vespers
that
jesus
christ
is
a
for
by
the
great
and
admirable
sacrifice
of
jesus
christ
all
outward
and
visible
sacrifice
is
abolished
christ
says
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
which
i
entreat
everybody
to
read
diligently
offered
once
for
one
offering
he
hath
perfected
for
ever
them
that
are
christ
offered
and
not
if
the
sacrifice
is
perfect
why
should
it
be
repeated
come
forward
then
ye
priests
and
answer
if
ye
can
is
not
all
by
this
unhappy
mass
the
whole
world
has
been
plunged
into
a
common
idolatry
are
we
not
given
to
understand
falsely
that
under
the
forms
of
bread
and
wine
jesus
christ
is
corporeally
really
and
personally
contained
in
flesh
and
bone
as
long
broad
and
entire
as
when
he
was
alive
and
yet
holy
scripture
and
our
faith
teaches
us
the
contrary
that
jesus
christ
after
his
resurrection
ascended
into
heaven
paul
writes
to
the
colossians
those
things
which
are
above
christ
sitteth
on
the
right
hand
of
god
listen
paul
does
not
say
seek
christ
who
is
in
the
mass
or
in
the
sanctuary
or
in
the
box
or
in
the
cupboard
he
says
seek
christ
is
in
if
the
body
is
in
heaven
it
is
not
on
earth
and
if
it
is
on
earth
it
is
not
in
heaven
a
real
body
can
never
be
in
more
than
one
place
at
a
time
where
it
occupies
a
certain
space
of
a
certain
size
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
twenty
or
thirty
years
old
to
be
hidden
in
a
bit
of
dough
like
their
wafer
knew
this
well
when
he
wrote
until
the
world
comes
to
an
end
lord
is
on
but
his
divinity
is
everywhere
and
so
did
fulgentius
when
he
wrote
the
lord
was
absent
from
heaven
according
to
his
human
nature
when
he
was
on
earth
and
left
the
earth
when
he
ascended
to
but
as
for
the
divine
nature
it
never
quitted
heaven
when
he
came
down
to
earth
and
did
not
leave
the
earth
when
he
ascended
to
heaven
any
one
of
us
says
here
is
christ
or
the
priests
say
we
must
believe
him
but
christ
says
it
at
the
moment
of
the
communion
they
chant
lift
your
hearts
on
high
but
they
do
the
contrary
and
exhort
us
to
seek
christ
not
but
in
their
hands
in
their
boxes
and
in
their
cupboards
further
these
blind
priests
adding
error
to
error
teach
in
their
madness
that
after
they
have
breathed
upon
or
spoken
over
the
bread
which
they
take
between
their
fingers
and
also
over
the
wine
that
they
put
in
the
chalice
there
remains
neither
bread
nor
wine
but
that
jesus
christ
is
there
alone
by
big
and
monstrous
words
doctrine
of
devils
opposed
to
all
scripture
i
ask
these
where
did
they
find
that
big
word
transubstantiation
matthew
mark
john
paul
and
the
old
fathers
never
spoke
of
it
when
they
made
mention
of
the
supper
those
holy
writers
openly
and
simply
called
the
bread
and
wine
and
paul
does
not
say
eat
the
body
of
jesus
christ
but
eat
this
ah
scripture
employs
no
deception
and
there
is
no
pretence
in
it
the
bread
is
therefore
bread
enemies
of
the
word
of
god
shameless
heretics
they
are
not
satisfied
with
pretending
to
enclose
the
body
of
jesus
christ
in
their
wafer
but
see
into
what
absurdities
their
superstition
leads
them
they
are
not
ashamed
to
say
that
the
body
of
jesus
christ
may
be
eaten
by
rats
spiders
and
vermin
yes
there
it
is
printed
in
red
letters
in
their
missals
in
the
item
beginning
thus
if
the
body
of
the
lord
be
eaten
by
mice
and
spiders
be
reduced
to
nothing
or
be
very
much
gnawed
or
if
the
maggot
is
found
whole
inside
let
it
be
burned
and
placed
in
the
reliquary
earth
why
openest
thou
not
to
swallow
up
these
horrible
blasphemers
o
hateful
men
is
that
gnawed
body
really
the
body
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
would
the
lord
suffer
himself
to
be
eaten
by
mice
and
spiders
he
who
is
the
bread
of
angels
and
of
all
the
children
of
god
has
been
given
us
to
feed
vermin
him
who
is
incorruptible
at
the
right
hand
of
god
will
you
make
liable
to
worms
and
rottenness
did
not
david
write
the
contrary
prophesying
his
own
resurrection
wretches
were
there
no
other
evil
in
all
your
infernal
theology
than
the
irreverence
with
which
you
speak
of
the
precious
body
of
jesus
are
you
not
blasphemers
and
heretics
yea
the
greatest
and
most
enormous
the
world
has
ever
seen
yes
kindle
your
faggots
but
let
it
be
to
burn
and
roast
yourselves
why
should
you
kindle
them
for
us
because
we
will
not
believe
in
your
idols
in
your
new
gods
in
your
new
christs
who
let
themselves
be
eaten
by
vermin
and
in
you
also
who
are
worse
than
vermin
mean
all
these
games
you
play
round
your
god
of
dough
toying
with
him
like
a
cat
with
a
mouse
you
break
him
into
three
pieces
and
then
you
put
on
a
piteous
look
as
if
you
were
very
sorrowful
you
beat
your
breasts
you
call
him
the
lamb
of
god
and
pray
to
him
for
peace
john
showed
jesus
christ
ever
present
ever
living
living
all
in
adorable
truth
but
you
show
your
wafer
divided
into
pieces
and
then
you
eat
it
calling
for
something
to
drink
what
would
any
man
say
who
had
never
witnessed
such
monkey
tricks
did
paul
or
john
ever
eat
christ
in
that
manner
and
would
they
acknowledge
such
mountebanks
as
the
servants
of
god
the
practice
of
your
mass
is
very
contrary
to
the
practice
of
the
holy
supper
of
jesus
christ
certainly
there
is
no
marvel
in
that
for
there
is
nothing
common
between
christ
and
belial
holy
supper
of
jesus
christ
reminds
us
of
the
great
love
with
which
he
loved
us
so
that
he
washed
us
in
his
blood
it
presents
to
us
on
the
part
of
the
lord
the
body
and
blood
of
his
son
in
order
that
we
should
communicate
in
the
sacrifice
of
his
death
and
that
jesus
should
be
our
everlasting
food
it
calls
us
to
make
protest
of
our
faith
and
of
the
certain
confidence
we
have
of
being
saved
jesus
having
ransomed
us
by
giving
to
all
of
us
only
one
bread
it
reminds
us
of
the
charity
in
which
we
being
all
of
the
same
spirit
ought
to
live
that
holy
supper
being
thus
fully
understood
rejoices
the
believer
soul
in
all
humility
and
imparts
to
him
all
gentle
kindness
and
loving
charity
the
fruit
of
the
mass
is
very
different
by
it
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
is
prevented
the
time
is
occupied
with
howling
chanting
empty
ceremonies
candles
incense
disguises
and
all
manner
of
conjuration
and
the
poor
world
looked
upon
as
a
lamb
or
as
sheep
is
miserably
deceived
cajoled
led
do
i
say
bitten
gnawed
and
devoured
as
if
by
ravening
wolves
means
of
this
mass
they
have
laid
hands
on
everything
destroyed
everything
swallowed
up
everything
by
its
means
they
have
disinherited
princes
and
kings
lords
and
shopkeepers
and
all
whom
we
could
name
dead
or
alive
o
false
witnesses
traitors
robbers
of
the
honour
of
god
and
more
hateful
than
the
devils
themselves
short
the
truth
chases
them
the
truth
alarms
them
and
by
truth
shall
their
reign
shortly
be
destroyed
for
ever
such
was
the
proclamation
posted
up
in
paris
and
all
over
france
we
trace
in
it
we
must
confess
the
coarseness
of
the
language
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
especially
in
a
passage
which
must
have
greatly
stirred
the
anger
of
the
clergy
where
the
placard
in
speaking
of
the
pope
and
cardinals
priests
and
monks
calls
them
false
prophets
wolves
seducers
and
gives
them
other
names
besides
which
are
rarely
employed
in
our
days
except
in
the
bulls
of
the
roman
pontiffs
we
discover
in
this
writing
the
antipapistical
spirit
in
all
its
unreflecting
force
certainly
when
it
says
that
the
true
supper
of
christ
the
believer
soul
and
imparts
to
him
all
gentle
kindness
and
loving
charity
we
taste
the
savour
of
the
gospel
but
generally
speaking
this
manifesto
is
an
engine
of
war
with
a
brazen
head
if
we
transport
ourselves
to
the
early
days
of
the
reformation
we
can
understand
that
it
was
necessary
to
employ
vigorous
to
beat
down
the
old
and
apparently
unshakeable
walls
of
popery
every
line
in
this
placard
reveals
to
us
the
but
also
impetuous
and
eloquent
farel
frank
decisive
intrepid
among
men
who
had
the
admirable
heart
of
the
knight
without
reproach
with
his
thirst
for
danger
and
was
the
bayard
of
the
battles
of
god
the
work
resembles
the
workman
while
conceding
something
to
the
times
in
which
the
placard
was
written
and
posted
up
we
may
ask
whether
that
act
proceeded
solely
from
a
movement
of
the
mind
free
from
every
tinge
of
human
passion
and
was
one
of
the
arms
that
the
apostles
would
have
employed
in
any
case
it
seems
to
us
certain
that
more
moderate
language
would
really
have
been
stronger
and
more
surely
have
attained
its
end
this
is
what
the
event

produced
an
immense

the

were

and
the

alarmed
and
the

filled
with
indignation
but
the
adversaries
of
popery
did
not

at

there
appeared

this

which
was

increased

heretics
it
was
said
resolved
to
surprise
the
catholics
during
divine
service
and
to
murder
men
women
and
children
without
mercy
an
absurd
imputation
invented
says
a
romish
historian
to
make
the
reformers
odious
it
was
believed
all
the
same
and
horrible
rumours
began
shortly
to
circulate
among
the
crowd
frightful
plot
has
been
laid
against
the
state
and
the
church
this
placard
is
the
signal
the
heretics
intend
to
fire
the
churches
and
palaces
massacre
the
catholics
abolish
the
monarchy
and
reduce
the
kingdom
to
a
desert
death
to
the
lutherans
nowhere
was
the
fury
so
great
as
at
the
sorbonne
among
the
doctors
the
first
outbreak
of
their
anger
was
incredibly
violent
action
says
the
chronicler
them
into
such
fury
that
their
former
violence
seemed
tolerable
no
tempest
ever
equalled
it
in
severity
the
thunderbolt
was
destined
however
to
be
launched
from
a
different
quarter
francis
who
was
then
at
blois
had
for
some
time
felt
a
certain
uneasiness
with
regard
to
the
reform
one
day
in
when
he
was
complaining
of
the
pope
to
the
nuncio
and
insinuating
that
france
might
easily
imitate
the
example
of
henry
sire
replied
the
nuncio
will
be
the
first
to
suffer
the
religion
of
a
people
can
not
be
changed
without
their
next
demanding
the
change
of
the
prince
it
had
been
of
no
use
to
tell
francis
that
neither
the
german
princes
nor
henry
viii
himself
had
been
dethroned
by
the
reformation
the
nuncio
words
had
sunk
like
an
arrow
into
his
heart
sidenote
the
placard
on
the
king
door
blois
was
not
exempt
from
the
evangelical
movement
and
the
reform
had
made
its
way
among
the
choristers
of
the
royal
chapel
it
was
one
of
these
who
was
commissioned
to
post
up
the
placards
in
that
city
being
of
a
daring
and
enthusiastic
temperament
this
individual
resolved
to
post
the
protestant
manifesto
in
the
castle
itself
to
which
he
had
easy
access
entering
it
at
a
favourable
moment
he
crept
with
his
handbills
as
far
as
the
king
chamber
and
being
satisfied
that
there
were
no
servants
or
courtiers
in
the
gallery
he
fastened
the
paper
to
his
majesty
door
and
then
retired
hastily
this
imprudent
and
guilty
action
for
it
was
disrespectful
was
to
be
cruelly
atoned
for
montmorency
and
the
cardinal
de
tournon
appeared
in
the
morning
before
the
king
as
was
their
custom
they
had
the
ear
of
francis
and
had
long
been
looking
for
an
opportunity
to
deal
a
desperate
blow
at
the
reformation
just
as
these
two
personages
were
about
to
enter
the
closet
they
caught
sight
of
the
placard
posted
on
the
door
they
stopped
and
read
it
and
taking
the
matter
seriously
not
without
reason
they
tore
down
the
paper
angrily
and
carried
it
in
to
their
master
nothing
in
the
world
could
excite
him
so
much
as
an
attack
like
that
his
royal
dignity
was
in
his
eyes
almost
as
sacred
as
the
divine
majesty
he
trembled
and
turned
pale
he
took
the
paper
and
then
gave
it
back
and
disturbed
by
such
audacity
he
ordered
them
to
read
it
sidenote
the
king
indignation
it
was
what
tournon
wanted
he
read
the
document
to
the
king
dwelling
on
the
most
irritating
passages
but
the
prince
could
not
hold
out
to
the
end
the
insult
offered
to
his
person
the
impression
which
such
a
public
scandal
might
produce
on
his
allies
and
especially
on
the
pope
the
reflection
that
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
preparing
the
reconciliation
of
protestants
and
catholics
a
few
fanatics
should
stir
up
all
the
passions
of
the
priests
and
the
people
and
cause
his
pacific
designs
to
this
exasperated
his
mind
more
than
the
attack
upon
the
mass
those
who
were
about
him
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
represented
the
affair
as
one
of
montmorency
and
de
tournon
drove
the
bolt
deep
into
the
king
heart
burst
into
a
transport
of
passion
wrote
sturm
to
melanchthon
was
so
inflamed
says
the
of
put
himself
in
such
a
rage
says
theodore
beza
became
so
hot
that
everybody
trembled
about
him
says
the
catholic
all
be
seized
without
distinction
he
exclaimed
are
suspected
of
i
will
exterminate
them
all
the
event
caused
a
great
agitation
nothing
else
was
talked
of
and
every
one
described
it
in
his
own
manner
you
know
said
some
the
king
in
the
very
height
of
his
passion
taking
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
pulled
out
a
placard
which
fell
at
his
feet
some
clever
fellow
had
slipped
the
copy
in
may
believe
it
if
you
like
says
fontaine
estimating
this
popular
story
at
its
real
value
the
whole
household
of
the
castle
was
immediately
on
the
alert
to
discover
the
author
of
the
misdeed
which
was
no
hard
matter
the
lutheran
opinions
of
the
chorister
were
known
to
many
he
was
arrested
put
in
chains
and
sent
to
paris
to
be
tried
but
the
king
wrath
was
not
to
be
confined
to
this
man
the
crime
had
been
committed
everywhere
the
punishment
must
be
inflicted
everywhere
and
order
the
parliament
to
execute
strict
justice
said
the
king
tell
the
that
to
encourage
him
i
increase
his
salary
by
six
hundred
livres
a
year
for
life
let
inquisition
be
made
forthwith
through
all
the
realm
for
the
people
who
are
such
enemies
of
god
the
parliament
had
not
waited
for
the
king
orders
on
the
morrow
of
the
famous
day
the
october
the
chief
president
pierre
lizet
convened
all
the
chambers
and
the
crowded
court
being
moved
and
indignant
ordered
a
minute
search
and
processions
to
be
made
the
trumpets
sounded
the
people
assembled
and
an
officer
of
the
parliament
proclaimed
shall
give
information
as
to
the
person
or
persons
who
stuck
up
the
said
placards
he
shall
receive
from
the
court
a
reward
of
one
hundred
crowns
and
all
who
conceal
them
shall
be
burnt
all
this
while
the
evangelical
christians
and
especially
those
who
had
set
fire
to
the
mine
alarmed
at
the
terrible
explosion
it
had
made
remained
hidden
and
silent
in
their
houses
they
knew
morin
skill
in
discovering
his
victims
and
inventing
tortures
a
dark
future
saddened
their
countenances
then
were
heard
among
them
groans
and
regrets
and
mournful
deliberations
shall
we
do
they
said
take
flight
leave
home
and
family
and
country
without
knowing
where
to
go
how
gloomy
the
future
but
is
it
not
better
to
lose
all
these
than
to
lose
your
life
such
were
the
conversations
held
almost
everywhere
fathers
and
wives
and
children
conjured
with
tears
those
whom
they
loved
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
anger
some
of
them
indeed
did
leave
their
homes
by
night
and
flee
many
of
those
who
had
not
posted
the
placards
but
who
were
known
by
the
frank
confession
of
their
faith
thought
that
the
danger
could
not
concern
them
the
unhappy
people
hesitated
and
delayed
and
many
of
them
paid
dearly
for
their
imprudent
security
sidenote
the
brethren

great
opponent
of
the
religious
movement
and
a

very
dissolute

rare
audacity
in
catching

remarkable
subtlety

their
answers

meditating
the
plan
of
his
campaign

the
business

desired
to
catch
all
the
heretics
together
by
one
cast
of
his
net
but
how
a
bright
idea
struck
him
by
seizing
one
man
he
hoped
to
take
all
the
rest
know
that
shop
where
they
sell
sheaths
and
other
such
articles
in

he
said

what
is
worse
you

will
lead
me
to

the
poor
man
understanding
what
he
meant
tremblingly
refused
to
commit
such
treason
the

to

soon
as

and
it
is
quite
fair
that
you
should
begin

dance
the
wretched
man
trembled
what
a
frightful
alternative
how
could
he
go
to
those
whom
he
was
wont
to
summon
to
the
temple
of
god
in
order
to
deliver
them
to
the
flames
there
was
a
terrible
struggle
in
his
soul
but
the
fear
of
god
was
overcome
the
light
of
reason
extinct
all
regard
for
honour
put
aside
entered
into
judas
and
he
sought
how
he
could
betray
his
brethren
believing
himself
the
point
of
being
burnt
says
beza
he
promised
all
he
was
asked
paris
was
all
in
commotion
the
streets
were
hung
with
drapery
processions
were
made
and
in
order
to
wipe
out
the
insult
offered
to
the
mass
the
was
carried
solemnly
through
every
parish
morin
took
advantage
of
this
agitation
to
conceal
his
proceedings
the
treacherous
went
before
him
pale
and
trembling
sergeants
followed
him
at
a
little
distance
and
this
cruel
company
glided
silently
through
the
streets
the
stopped
and
pointed
to
a
door
morin
entered
the
startled
family
protested
their
innocence
in
vain
the
lieutenant
ordered
the
poor
creatures
to
be
manacled
and
then
continued
his
pitiless
course
spared
no
house
great
or
small
says
the
chronicler
even
the
colleges
of
the
university
of
paris
sidenote
valeton
and
his
books
seized
by
degrees
the
news
of
this
horrible
expedition
spread
through
the
capital
anguish
seized
not
only
the
friends
of
farel
but
all
who
were
not
fanatical
adherents
of
rome
and
even
the
mere
followers
of
learning
or
of
pleasure
who
had
no
taste
for
the
reformation
made
all
the
city
quake
for
no
one
knew
that
he
might
not

the
number
of
the
suspected
in

troop
was

valeton
the
receiver
who
kept
near
the
window
saw
morin
approaching
hurriedly
turning
away
he
said
to
his
wife
he
is
take
the
chest
of
books
out
of
my
room
i
will
run
and
meet
him
i
will
speak
to
him
and
detain
him
so
as
to
give
you
time
the
startled
young
woman
took
the
books
and
hastily
thrust
them
into
a
this
man
said
the
immediately
he
saw
valeton
him
be
put
into
close
confinement
he
then
went
upstairs
and
searched
every
corner
saw
the
empty
chest
but
found
nothing
being
impatient
to
interrogate
his
prisoner
he
did
not
stop
but
proceeded
straight
to
the
prison
whither
he
had
been
taken
he
could
not
entrap
him
the
receiver
being
a
clever
man
eluded
all
his
questions
the
lieutenant
began
to
grow
nervous
thinking
to
himself
that
the
receiver
had
influence
and
was
a
man
likely
to
bear
him
a
grudge
he
resolved
to
destroy
him
by
proceeding
more
craftily
the
empty
chest
recurred
to
his
mind
it
must
have
contained
something
that
had
been
removed
at
his
approach
he
immediately
returned
to
the
house
of
the
accused
and
standing
near
the
chest
said
in
a
natural
tone
your
husband
has
confessed
that
he
kept
his
books
and
secret
papers
in
this
trunk
besides
we
are
agreed
i
desire
to
behave
mercifully
towards
him
if
you
give
a
certain
sum
of
money
and
tell
me
where
the
books
are
i
swear
to
you
before
god
that
your
husband
shall
suffer
no
prejudice
the
wife
who
was
thoughtless
and
much
disturbed
by
what
had
taken
place
suffered
herself
to
be
caught
by
this
trick
morin
put
so
many
and
subtle
questions
that
trusting
in
his
promise
she
told
him
everything
thought
the
wished
to
hide
his
books
from
us
because
he
felt
himself
guilty
of
heresy
having
seized
them
he
left
the
house
and
putting
the
papers
in
a
place
of
safety
went
to
look
for
other
victims
if
there
was
one
man
in
paris
who
could
not
be
suspected
of
having
fixed
up
the
placards
it
was
the
poor
paralytic
he
could
hardly
leave
his
bed
that
was
of
no
consequence
and
bartholomew
milon
was
one
of
the
first
towards
whose
house
morin
turned
his
steps
he
had
had
him
in
his
prisons
before
this
says
the
of
lord
had
delivered
him
to
make
him
serve
for
the
consolation
of
his
people
in
this
bitter
season
the
knew
the
shoemaker
shop
very
well
it
was
noted
down
in
his
books
he
entered
like
one
out
of
his
mind
and
foaming
with
rage
into
the
room
where
poor
berthelot
was
lying
get
up
he
cried
looking
fiercely
at
him
bartholomew
being
terrified
by
the
hideous
face
of
the
tyrant
replied
with
a
sweet
smile
sir
it
wants
a
greater
master
than
you
to
make
me
rise
this
fellow
away
said
the
brute
to
his
creatures
and
after
ordering
them
to
carry
with
them
a
piece
of
furniture
in
which
the
paralytic
kept
his
papers
he
continued
his
inglorious
campaign
sidenote
arrests
the
now
proceeded
towards
the
gate
of
denis
to
the
sign
of
the
and
entered
the
shop
of
the
wealthy
tradesman
du
bourg
when
they
caught
sight
of
him
all
who
had
any
employment
there
were
startled
but
although
they
loved
their
master
well
no
one
stirred
to
defend
him
the
draper
wife
daughter
of
another
rich
tradesman
named
favereau
was
not
so
tranquil
bursting
into
tears
and
shrieking
she
conjured
the
cruel
morin
not
to
take
her
husband
away
nothing
could
soften
him
and
he
arrested
du
bourg
is
one
of
those
who
pasted
up
the
papers
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
said
the
lieutenant
and
took
him
away
next
came
the
turn
of
the
poor
bricklayer
poille
who
was
captured
in
his
wretched
hut
after
them
many
persons
without
distinction
of
rank
or
sex
were
shut
who
had
condemned
the
placards
as
well
as
those
who
had
approved
of
them
informers
were
not
wanting
they
were
given
a
fourth
part
of
the
property
of
the
accused
and
accordingly
these
as
they
were
called
were
indefatigable
in
hunting
out
victims
each
of
them
could
be
accuser
and
witness
in
one
it
was
a
reign
of
terror
and
all
good
people
were
astounded
at
it
the
sorbonne
took
advantage
of
this
furious
tempest
to
be
avenged
on
margaret
and
to
punish
her
friends
that
princess
had
quitted
béarn
at
the
beginning
of
summer
to
be
present
at
the
marriage
of
her
isabella
of
navarre
with
viscount
de
rohan
and
had
obtained
her
brother
permission
for
roussel
who
was
with
her
as
well
as
courault
and
berthaud
to
preach
in
paris
these
moderate
men
were
strongly
opposed
to
the
act
accomplished
in
the
night
of
the
october
they
were
thrown
into
prison
all
the
same
as
there
was
no
apprehension
of
offending
the
king
allies
many
germans
were
roughly
seized
catholics
as
well
as
protestants
it
was
enough
to
have
a
transrhenane
accent
to
be
suspected
of
heresy
in
the
meantime
francis
arrived
in
paris
cardinals
sorbonne
parliament
all
the
ardent
friends
of
outvied
each
other
in
zeal
to
confirm
wise
and
good
prince
in
his
religion
which
had
been
somewhat
shaken
they
must
take
advantage
of
the
crisis
to
detach
him
from
his
alliances
with
the
english
and
the
saxons
now
was
the
time
for
striking
the
blow
and
for
severing
these
guilty
ties
cardinal
de
tournon
was
particularly
indefatigable
and
continually
calling
for
punishments
when
du
chatel
bishop
of
tulle
declared
his
opposition
to
sanguinary
measures
tolerance
has
a
suspicious
look
said
de
tournon
is
unbecoming
a
true
son
of
the
church
am
acting
like
a
bishop
answered
du
chatel
firmly
you
like
a
hangman
but
nothing
could
check
either
the
cardinal
or
duprat
they
said
to
francis
preserve
the
honour
which
pius
ii
gave
our
kings
when
he
said
the
kings
of
france
have
this
peculiarity
that
they
preserve
the
catholic
faith
and
the
honour
of
churchmen
and
added
prevent
the
spreading
of
a
fire
by
knocking
down
the
houses
which
it
has
first
touched
and
even
the
adjoining
ones
do
likewise
sire
order
those
to
be
exterminated
utterly
and
without
reserve
who
rebel
against
the
church
kindle
the
fires
and
erect
gibbets
for
the
use
of
the
lutherans
a
new
act
of
madness
as
some
historians
relate
but
which
we
can
hardly
believe
inflamed
the
king
wrath
still
further
the
very
night
of
his
arrival
we
are
told
the
placards
reappeared
and
were
stuck
on
the
gates
of
the
louvre
nay
more
it
is
asserted
that
as
francis
was
going
to
bed
he
found
the
document
under
his
pillow
the
historian
who
records
these
things
is
very
prone
to
exaggeration
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
such
stories
are
mere
fables
invented
by
the
enemies
of
the
reform
its
friends
being
just
then
too
terrified
to
show
such
boldness
sidenote
margaret
sorrow
no
one
was
more
alarmed
and
more
agitated
than
margaret
nothing
was
more
opposed
to
her
nature
than
the
style
of
the
placards
and
in
reality
they
were
not
only
an
attack
against
rome
but
a
protest
against
the
conciliatory
catholic
system
of
the
queen
of
navarre
those
who
protested
in
this
way
bore
a
certain
resemblance
not
reckoning
their
christianity
to
a
character
in
literature
they
condemned
alike
the
fanatic
romanists
and
the
spiritual
les

les

the
queen
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
blow
that
was
preparing
and
at
the
very
moment
when
she
believed
the
gospel
to
be
on
the
point
of
gaining
the
victory
everything
seemed
ended
for
it
in
france
her
brother
anger
the
hard
look
he
turned
upon
her
for
perhaps
the
first
time
alarmed
this
princess
who
had
it
is
true
a
strong
understanding
but
also
a
heart
easily
moved
and
even
timid
she
shed
floods
of
tears
she
had
no
doubt
that
the
whole
affair
was
the
result
of
a
plot
contrived
between
the
sorbonne
and
cardinal
de
tournon
lord
she
said
to
the
king

these
infamous
placards
have
been
invented
by
men
who
wish
to
make
the
responsibility
of
their
abominable
manœuvre
fall
upon
us
she
resolved
to
do
everything
to
save
roussel
at
least
the
very
thought
that
he
might
be
burnt
terrified
her
why
had
she
not
left

unusual
coldness
of

find
him
deserving
something
better
than

he

i
have
known
him

five
years
and
if
i
had
seen
anything
suspicious
in

i
should
not
have
put
up
so
long
with
such
poison
i
entreat
you

montmorency
far
from
being

the
queen
asked

to
ruin
not
only
roussel
but
also
margaret

while
cardinals
duprat

de
tournon
helped
him
to
insinuate
into
the
mind
that
his
sister
had
some
share
in
the
matter
of
the
placards
the
coldness
the
harshness

of

towards

daily
heartbroken

unable

some
went
further
than

and
de

and
would
have
made
their
vengeance
fall
upon
the
king
himself
the
impetuous
beda
that
tribune
of
the
sorbonne
who
forgot
neither
his
exile
nor
his
imprisonment
sought
an
opportunity
of
revenging
himself
on
the
prince
who
had
disgraced
him
he
hated
francis
cordially
to
do
him
an
injury
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
doing
it
was
his
ambition
not
satisfied
with
ascribing
the
placards
to
queen
margaret
he
would
accuse
the
king
himself
going
into
the
pulpit
he
preached
a
sermon
against
that
prince
full
of
invective
it
is
not
the
king
who
had
these
bills
posted
up
he
said
least
he
is
responsible
for
them
the
favour
he
shows
the
heretics
and
his
alliance
with
the
king
of
england
are
the
cause
of
all
this
mischief
this
time
the
priest
was
mistaken
in
fancying
himself
more
powerful
than
the
sovereign
being
accused
before
the
parliament
of
beda
was
thrown
into
prison
condemned
to
do
penance
in
front
of
the
church
of
notre
dame
and
to
be
confined
for
the
rest
of
his
days
in
the
abbey
of
michael
where
he
died
thus
perished
in
obscurity
this
furious
forerunner
of
the
league
the
revolutionary
fury
of
the
romish
champion
softened
francis
a
little
finding
himself
accused
as
well
as
his
sister
he
recalled
her
to
paris
the
queen
whose
courage
was
as
easily
revived
as
it
was
cast
down
arrived
at
the
louvre
full
of
hope
not
doubting
that
she
would
win
over
the
king
to
the
golden
mean
she
loved
so
dearly
but
she
found
francis
less
accessible
than
she
had
fancied
and
still
showing
signs
of
his
but
this
did
not
stop
her
imprudent
and
violent
men
had
wished
to
abolish
the
mass
by
means
of
a
fanatical
placard
she
will
try
to
attain
the
same
end
by
gentler
and
more
prudent
means
want
no
church
and
no
sacraments
said
the
king
to
her
abruptly
the
queen
of
navarre
replied
that
on
the
contrary
she
wanted
both
and
profiting
by
the
opportunity
for
carrying
out
her
plan
she
represented
to
her
brother
that
it
was
necessary
to
unite
the
whole
of
christendom
into
one
body
with
the
bishop
of
rome
at
its
head
and
that
for
this
object
the
priests
should
be
brought
to
give
up
voluntarily
certain
scholastic
doctrines
and
superstitious
practices
which
stripped
the
ritual
of
the
church
of
its
primitive
beauty
then
taking
from
her
pocket
a
paper
which
lefèvre
had
drawn
up
at
her
request
during
her
stay
in
the
south
she
presented
it
to
the
king
it
was
the
confession
of
faith
known
as
the
of
seven

to
her

it

and
people

there
will
be
no
commemorations
of
the
virgin
or
of
the
saints
the
communion
will
be
celebrated
with
ordinary
bread
the
priest
after
breaking
and
eating
will
distribute
the
remainder
among
the
people
further
priests
will
have
liberty
to
marry
when
francis
had
heard
the
seven
points
of
his
sister
mass
he
asked
her
what
was
left
of
the
roman
mass
then
the
queen
taking
him
on
his
weak
to
him
that
by
means
of
this
compromise
he
would
unite
all
sects
and
restore
the
catholic
unity
which
had
been
broken
for
so
many
centuries
was
it
not
the
greatest
honour
to
which
a
prince
could
aspire
sidenote

before
francis
francis
appeared
to
be
shaken
but
yet
he
saw
great
difficulties

him
to
send
for
roussel

she
said
the
thing
is

the
king
was
curious
says
an
historian
and
accepted
the
offer
the
three
evangelicals
were
taken
from
their
prison
and
conveyed
to
the
louvre
where
the
queen
presented
them
to
her
brother
she
was
full
of
joy
the
matter
of
the
placards
which
threatened
to
ruin
everything
might
possibly
be
the
means
of
saving
everything
she
was
deceived
when
francis
talked
with
her
it
was
no
trouble
to
be
like
a
kind
brother
with
a
sister
but
in

presence

friars
and
roussel

was
a
master
these
persons
displeased
him
the
zeal
with
which
they
pointed
out
the
errors
and
abuses
of
the
mass
irritated
him
and
he
sent
them
back
hurriedly

was

calmer
formerly

well
accustomed

him
in

all

themselves
in

led
to

death

him
to
a
tumbril
the
procession
then
took
its
way
towards
the
grève
as
he
passed
before
his
father
house
milon
greeted
it
with
a
smile
he
reached
the
place
of
execution
where
the
stake
had
been
prepared
the
flames
said
the
officer
in
command
sentence
says
he
is
to
be
burnt
a
slow
this
was
a
cruel
prospect
still
he
uttered
none
but
words
of
peace
he
knew
that
to
believe
and
to
suffer
was
the
life
of
a
christian
but
he
believed
that
the
grace
of
suffering
was
still
more
excellent
than
the
grace
of
faith
the
enemies
of
the
reformation
who
surrounded
the
burning
pile
listened
to
the
martyr
with
surprise
and
respect
the
evangelicals
were
deeply
moved
and
exclaimed
how
great
is
the
constancy
of
this
witness
to
the
son
of
god
both
in
his
life
and
in
his
death
the
next
day
it
was
the
turn
of
du
bourg
the
tradesman
of
the
rue
denis
the
wealth
he
had
enjoyed
during
his
life
the
tears
of
his
wife
the
solicitations
of
his
friends
had
been
ineffectual
to
save
him
he
was
a
man
of
decided
character
when
he
had
posted
up
the
placard
he
had
done
so
boldly
although
he
knew
that
the
act
might
cost
him
his
life
and
he
stepped
into
the
tumbril
with
the
same
courage
when
he
arrived
in
front
of
notre
dame
he
was
made
to
alight
a
taper
was
put
into
his
hand
and
a
cord
round
his
neck
and
he
was
then
taken
in
front
of
the
fountain
of
the
innocents
in
the
rue
denis
quite
near
his
might
have
been
seen
from
the
which
his
hand
was
cut
off
the
hand
that
had
fixed
up
the
terrible
protest
against
rome
fell
to
the
ground
but
the
man
stood
firm
believing
that
those
who
do
battle
under
earthly
captains
push
forward
unto
the
death
although
they
know
not
what
will
be
the
issue
much
more
ought
christians
who
are
sure
of
victory
to
fight
until
the
end
du
bourg
was
taken
to
the
halles
and
there
burnt
alive
sidenote
poille
sufferings
and
courage
on
the
it
was
poille
turn
that
old
disciple
of
showed
as
much
firmness
as
his
master
had
shown
weakness
the
mournful
procession
took
its
way
towards
the
faubourg
antoine
and
halted
before
the
church
of
catherine
it
was
here
the
stake
had
been
prepared
for
the
edification
of
the
believers
of
that
district
poille
got
down
from
the
cart
his
features
indicating
peace
and
joy
in
the
midst
of
the
guard
and
of
the
surrounding
crowd
he
thought
only
of
his
saviour
and
his
crown
lord
jesus
christ
he
said
in
heaven
and
i
am
ready
to
fight
for
him
on
earth
unto
the
last
drop
of
blood
this
confession
of
the
truth
at
the
moment
of
punishment
exasperated
the
executioners
a
bit
they
said
will
stop
your
prating
they
sprang
upon
him
opened
his
mouth
caught
hold
of
his
tongue
and
bored
a
hole
through
it
they
then
with
refined
cruelty
made
a
slit
in
his
cheek
through
which
they
drew
the
tongue
and
fastened
it
with
an
iron
pin
some
cries
were
heard
from
the
crowd
at
this
horrible
spectacle
they
proceeded
from
the
humble
christians
who
had
come
to
help
the
poor
bricklayer
with
their
compassionate
looks
poille
spoke
no
more
but
his
eyes
still
announced
the
peace
which
he
enjoyed
he
was
burnt
alive
the
punishments
followed
one
another
rapidly
many
other
sentences
had
been
delivered
on
the
november
a
printer
who
had
reprinted
luther
works
and
a
bookseller
who
had
sold
them
were
taken
together
to
the
place
maubert
the
poor
creatures
had
probably
only
thought
it
a
good
speculation
they
were
however
burnt
at
the
stake
on
the
december
a
young
clerk
underwent
the
same
punishment
in
front
of
notre
dame
on
the
following
day
a
young
illuminator
a
native
of
compiègne
who
worked
in
a
shop
near
the
pont
michel
died
on
the
pile
constructed
at
the
foot
of
that
bridge
sometimes
it
was
deemed
sufficient
flog
the
accused
naked
to
confiscate
their
property
and
to
banish
them
sidenote
more
fugitives
the
terror
was
universal
all
who
had
kept
up
any
relations
with
the
victims
or
had
occasionally
frequented
the
meetings
were
uneasy
and
troubled
there
was
great
agitation
in
the
evangelical
houses
flight
seemed
the
only
refuge
and
many
made
preparations
for
their
departure
although
we
have
spoken
of
the
evangelical
christians
we
have
not
named
them
all
there
were
some
whose
profession
without
being
as
public
as
that
of
du
bourg
de
la
forge
and
milon
was
yet
quite
as
sincere
many
of
them
made
themselves
known
at

of

were

of

the
reformation

gained
many
followers
among
the

it
was

all

society
had
furnished
representatives
to
that
body
which
was
hurrying
from
the
capital
along
every
road
these
noble
christians
were
often
treated
ignominiously
in
their
flight
many
had
pity
on
them
but
others
insulted
them
they
were
sometimes
obliged
to
hide
themselves
in
stables
or
in
the
woods
worn
out
by
poverty
and
hunger
clothed
in
and
dirty
garments
the
better
to
elude
their
enemies
but
the
peace
of
faith
consoled
them
they
had
been
unwilling
to
deny
christ
they
had
preferred
as
calvin
says
to
renounce
the
life
of
this
world
to
live
for
ever
in
heaven
and
the
hope
of
a
glorious
resurrection
prevented
them
from
fainting
margaret
shed
many
tears
in

silent
sorrow
spoke
eloquently
to
her
brother
presently
she
risked
a
few
prayers
in
behalf
of
her
friends
roussel
courault
and
berthaud
the
king
was
still
irritated
against
them
but
the
love
he
felt
for
his
sister
prevailed
he
ordered
the
three
doctors
to
be
taken
out
of
prison
and
put
in
a
convent
the
dungeon
was
changed
to
a
cell
which
was
some
slight
relief
and
a
sharp
reprimand
was
given
to
each
of
them
roussel
declared
that
he
had
no
desire
to
break
with
the
church
and
retired
to
his
abbey
at
clairac
the
feeble
berthaud
whom
the
punishments
had
frightened
resumed
his
monastic
dress
without
any
reserve
and
died
in
the
cloister
but
the
aged
and
intrepid
courault
remained
firm
in
vain
did
the
king
send
him
back
to
the
convent
in
vain
was
the
monk
frock
put
on
him
and
a
chaplet
in
his
hands
he
kept
silent
but
at
the
first
opportunity
some
days
only
after
he
had
been
sent
to
the
cloister
he
escaped
and
although
almost
blind
took
the
road
which
farel
and
calvin
had
already
trodden
and
reached
basle
sidenote
the
king
urged
to
persecute
this
pardon
almost
a
disgrace
to
the
king
who
granted
it
was
the
only
and
the
last
expression
of
francis
pity
after
having
given
way
to
his
sister
he
gave
way
to
the
courtiers
the
cardinals
the
sorbonne
and
parliament
the
king
indulgence
to
the
three
doctors
served
but
to
hasten
the
terrible
persecutions
that
were
about
to
begin
in
france
the
people
especially
at
paris
ignorant
and
superstitious
and
not
imagining
there
could
be
any
other
religion
than
that
which
they
had
been
taught
were
astonished
disturbed
and
uneasy
at
seeing
the
great
number
of
men
and
women
won
to
the
gospel
they
were
even
touched
by
the
serenity
of
the
martyrs
the
chiefs
of
the
ultramontane
party
alarmed
at
the
agitation
which
was
gradually
spreading
all
over
the
capital
and
desirous
of
strengthening
the
faith
of
the
masses
began
to
solicit
the
king
very
earnestly
they
reminded
him
of
the
paper
against
the
mass
and
called
for
severer
punishments
and
more
striking
satisfaction
they
represented
to
him
that
inhabitants
of
paris
were
much
disturbed
by
the
multitude
of
those
who
had
gone
astray
from
the
faith
they
seemed
to
see
the
waves
of
luther
doctrine
impetuously
advancing
from
germany
and
on
the
point
of
breaking
over
france
at
all
risks
a
dyke
must
be
raised
up
sufficient
to
stop
them
they
said
faithfully
to
your
successors
that
glorious
title
of
eldest
son
of
the
church
which
you
have
received
from
your
forefathers
you
know
how
greedy
the
french
mind
is
for
novelties
and
where
may
that
lead
us
give
a
public
proof
of
your
attachment
to
the
faith
francis
had
not
forgotten
the
placard
fastened
by
night
to
the
door
of
his
chamber
and
that
evangelical
remonstrance
seemed
in
is
eyes
a
scandalous
libel
aimed
at
his
majesty
let
there
be
more
burnings
then
but
it
is
desirable
that
they
should
be
accompanied
with
unusual
pomp
by
a
royal
law
and
constitution
it
was
ordered
that
they
should
pray
to
the
almighty
for
the
destruction
of
heresy
and
to
that
end
there
should
be
a
solemn
procession
and
an
expiatory
sacrifice
francis
intended
to
crown
it
with
acts
of
barbarity
all
paris
was
astir
the
streets
were
hung
with
drapery
were
erected
the
most
magnificent
dresses
were
preparing
in
the
palace
and
the
victims
in
the
dungeons
were
counted
francis
had
many
motives
for
giving
a
grand
spectacle
and
accompanying
it
with
bloody
interludes
public
policy
was
not
without
a
share
in
them
he
wished
to
silence
the
evil
tongues
that
were
raving
about
his
friendly
relations
with
henry
viii
and
the
good
grace
with
which
he
had
received
the
ambassador
from
the
grand
turk
he
wished
to
draw
down
the
blessings
of
heaven
upon
his
arms
he
wished
to
show
that
if
he
protected
sound
learning
he
despised
fanatical
writings
and
detested
the
anonymous
libels
circulated
at
the
same
time
as
the
placards
the
the
treatise
the
pope
and
a
host
of
others
but
the
wrath
that
had
seized
him
at
seeing
the
criminal
handbill
on
his
own
door
particularly
called
for
a
terrible
revenge
and
that
without
delay
the
january
arrived
early
in
the
morning
a
large
crowd
of
citizens
and
people
from
the
surrounding
country
filled
the
streets
even
the
roofs
of
the
houses
were
covered
with
spectators
this
curious
and
agitated
multitude
still
further
augmented
the
general
emotion
many
citizens
of
paris
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
was
not
the
smallest
piece
of
wood
or
stone
jutting
from
the
walls
that
was
not
occupied
provided
there
was
room
on
it
for
anybody
and
the
streets
seemed
paved
with
human
heads
the
innumerable
concourse
admired
the
tapestry
with
which
the
houses
were
hung
the
the
pictures
filled
with
splendid
mysteries
the
people
gathered
particularly
before
representations
of
the
of
the
probably
the
wandering
jew
others
of
very
great
singularity
before
the
door
of
each
house
was
a
lighted
torch
do
reverence
to
the
blessed
sacrament
and
the
holy
relics
sidenote
the
procession
of
relics
the
procession
began
at
six
in
the
morning
first
came
all
the
crosses
and
banners
of
the
several
parishes
then
followed
the
citizens
two
and
two
each
with
a
torch
and
the
four
mendicant
orders
with
the
priests
and
canons
of
the
city
never
had
so
many
relics
been
seen
before
it
was
not
only
living
men
who
figured
that
day
in
the
streets
of
the
capital
to
do
honour
to
the
mass

there
were

and
many
others
who
whole
or
in
part
were
paraded
before
the
people
the
crowd
regarded
these
ancient
relics
with
devout
admiration
the
body
of
the
saint
there
are
his
shoes
and
his
breeches
thus
spoke
the
devout
but
what
effect
did
these
superstitions
produce
on
enlightened
men
what
would
calvin
in
particular
have
said
that
great
friend
of
the
worship
in
spirit
and
in
truth
paid
to
god
alone
he
had
left
paris
some
months
since
but
had
he
been
there
still
at
the
moment
of
the
procession
at
de
la
forge
or
any
other
house
before
which
it
passed
what
would
have
been
his
feelings
these
we
learn
from
one
of
his
writings
in
which
he
treats
of
all
the
relics
displayed
at
this
time
before
the
parisians
this
is
the
proper
moment
for
showing
what
he
thought
of
these
pretended
relics
of
saints
irony
is
a
weapon
to
be
sparingly
used
in
religious
matters
we
find
it
employed
however
more
than
once
in
the
bible
for
instance
where
elijah
speaks
to
the
prophets
of
baal
calvin
might
therefore
make
use
of
it
but
he
was
not
naturally
given
to
humour
and
a
profound
seriousness
underlies
his
irony
the
holy
bodies
followed
each
other
along
the
streets
of
the
capital
the
admiration
of
the
citizens
increased
at
every
moment
they
believed
as
each
relic
passed
them
that
they
were
looking
at
an
object
unique
in
the
world
marvel
is
not
so
great
said
calvin
subsequently
have
not
only
body
of
each
of
these
saints
but
we
have
there
is
one
body
of
matthew
at
rome
a
second
at
padua
and
a
third
at
treves
there
is
one
of
lazarus
at
marseille
another
at
autun
and
a
third
at
avallon
soon
the
canons
of
the
holy
chapel
came
in
sight
wearing
their
copes
no
church
in
christendom
possessed
such
treasures
is
the
milk
said
calvin
is
not
a
petty
town
or
wretched
convent
where
they
do
not
show
us
this
milk
if
the
virgin
had
been
nursing
all
her
life
she
would
hardly
have
been
able
to
supply
such
an
abundance
is
our
lord
purple
robe
said
the
people
the
linen
cloth
he
tied
round
him
at
the
last
supper
and
his
swaddling
clothes
would
do
better
said
calvin
seek
for
christ
in
his
word
his
sacraments
and
spiritual
graces
than
in
his
frock
little
shirt
and
napkin
is
the
crown
of
thorns
was
soon
the
cry
the
sensation
produced
by
this
venerated
object
was
all
the
greater
and
the
struggles
of
the
people
to
get
near
it
all
the
stronger
because
it
had
never
before
been
seen
in
the
is
no
rarity
said
calvin
are
two
of
these
crowns
at
rome
one
at
vincennes
one
at
bourges
one
at
besançon
one
at
albi
one
at
toulouse
one
at

one
at

one
at

one
at

one
at
noyon
one
at
salvador
in
spain
one
at
jago
in
gallicia
and
many
others
in
other
places
besides
to
make
all
these
crowns
and
gather
all
these
thorns
they
must
have
cut
down
a
whole
hedge
comes
the
true
cross
again
there
was
a
rushing
and
shouting
citizens
and
strangers
crushing
one
another
is
not
the
only
one
said
the
reformer
is
no
petty
town
or
paltry
church
where
they
do
not
show
you
pieces
and
if
all
were
collected
together
there
would
be
a
load
for
a
great
barge
and
three
hundred
men
could
not
carry
it
next
appeared
a
shrine
which
attracted
universal
attention
it
contained
the
relics
of
genevieve
the
patron
saint
of
paris
it
was
the
last
anchor
in
the
midst
of
the
tempest
and
was
never
brought
out
except
when
france
was
in
great
peril
the
butchers
of
paris
had
offered
to
carry
this
precious
amulet
and
had
prepared
themselves
for
it
by
a
fast
of
several
days
they
moved
along
barefoot
and
dressed
in
long
shirts
around
this
somewhat
ferocious
group
there
was
a
continual
movement
she
is
the
holy
virgin
of
nanterre
was
the
cry
saved
our
forefathers
from
the
fury
of
attila
may
she
save
us
from
luther
the
people
threw
themselves
upon
the
relic
one
wished
to
touch
it
with
his
cap
another
with
his
handkerchief
a
third
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
some
even
more
daring
tried
to
kiss
it
the
son
lest
he
be
angry
and
ye
perish
from
the
way
when
his
wrath
is
kindled
but
a
after
the
relics
came
a
great
number
of
cardinals
archbishops
and
bishops
with
coped
and
mitred
abbots
then
under
a
magnificent
canopy
the
four
pillars
of
which
were
borne
by
the
king
three
sons
and
the
duke
of
vendome
first
prince
of
the
blood
came
the
host
carried
by
the
bishop
of
paris
and
adorned
as
if
it
had
been
the
lord
in
person
sidenote
penitence
of
the
king
then
appeared
francis
without
parade
bareheaded
and
on
foot
holding
a
lighted
taper
in
his
hand
like
a
penitent
commissioned
to
expiate
the
sacrilege
of
his
people
at
each
he
gave
his
taper
to
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
joined
his
hands
and
knelt
down
humbling
himself
not
for
his
adulteries
his
lies
or
his
false
these
he
did
not
for
the
audacity
of
those
who
did
not
like
the
mass
he
was
followed
by
the
queen
the
princes
and
princesses
the
foreign
ambassadors
and
all
the
court
the
chancellor
of
france
the
council
the
parliament
in
their
scarlet
robes
the
university
the
other
corporations
and
the
guard
all
walked
two
and
two
every
mark
of
extraordinary
piety
each
man
carried
a
lighted
torch
in
profound
silence
spiritual
songs
and
funereal
airs
alone
interrupted
from
time
to
time
the
quiet
of
this
gloomy
and
slow
procession
in
this
way
it
traversed
the
different
quarters
of
the
capital
followed
by
an
immense
crowd
of
people
and
the
inhabitants
of
each
street
standing
in
front
of
their
houses
fell
on
their
knees
as
the
host
went
by
the
crowd
was
so
great
that
bodies
of
archers
with
white
staves
in
their
hands
posted
in
every
street
could
scarcely
keep
open
a
passage
for
the
procession
at
length
they
arrived
at
the
church
of
notre
dame
the
sacrament
was
placed
on
the
altar
mass
was
sung
by
the
bishop
of
paris
and
all
imaginable
homage
was
paid
to
the
host
in
order
to
atone
for
the
insults
offered
to
it
by
the
placards
from
notre
dame
the
king
and
the
princes
returned
to
the
bishop
palace
there
are
days
of
evil
omen
in
history
there
is
one
especially
that
it
is
sufficient
to
name
to
fill
the
mind
with
sorrow
and
mourning
fatal
date
which
solemnly
inaugurated
in
france
the
epoch
of
persecution
and
martyrdom
on
the
a
king
of
france
surrounded
by
his
court
and
ministers
his
parliament
and
clergy
was
about
to
devote
to
death
with
all
due
ceremony
the
humble
disciples
of
the
gospel
what
the
valois
began
the
bourbons
continued
and
the
most
illustrious
of
them
carried
out
on
a
vast
scale
the
system
of
galleys
and
of
burning
piles
alas
there
are
dates
which
coincide
in
a
striking
and
pitiless
manner
four
hundred
and
years
later
there
was
another
of
the
simplest
the
meekest
the
most
generous
of
the
bourbons
condemned
by
misguided
men
to
suffer
death
ascended
the
scaffold
erected
in
a
public
place
in
paris
he
received
the
on
the
of
we
do
not
presume
to
explain
history
we
do
not
say
that
the
innocent
louis
xvi
paid
the
penalty
of
his
predecessor
crimes
and
that
god
ordained
the
expiation
commanded
by
francis
to
be
followed
by
another
but
the
coincidence
of
these
two
dates
startled
us
and
we
could
not
avoid
stopping
to
contemplate
them

a
holy
fear

speech
all
was
not
over
they
had
had
the
comedy
as
it
appeared
to
some
they
were
now
to
have
the
oratorical
address
and
then
the
tragedy
in
order
to
stifle
the
reformation
something
more
was
wanted
than
relics
chanting
and
images
blood
must
be
shed
but
first
of
all
there
should
be
a
speech
from
the
throne
we
do
not
doubt
the
sincerity
of
the
king
in
his
oratorical
movements
the
personal
offence
that
had
been
done
to
him
and
the
obstacles
raised
by
the
placards
to
his
political
plans
most
assuredly
engrossed
him
more
than
the
cause
of
catholicism
but
all
this
was
mixed
up
in
his
mind
and
he
was
eloquent
the
ambassadors
the
court
the
parliament
the
bishop
of
paris
attended
by
the
most
distinguished
of
his
clergy
the
rector
of
the
university
with
his
principal
doctors
the
provost
of
the
merchants
the
sheriffs
and
a
great
number
of
the
leading
officers
and
merchants
of
the
city
had
received
orders
to
assemble
after
dinner
in
the
great
hall
they
expected
a
speech
from
the
king
an
event
of
no
frequent
occurrence
in
those
times
which
made
them
all
the
more
impatient
ere
long
francis
entered
his
countenance
was
serious
sad
and
even
gloomy
his
children
the
other
princes
of
the
blood
the
cardinals
and
great
officers
of
state
surrounded
the
throne
whence
the
king
could
be
seen
and
heard
by
the
whole
assembly
he
took
his
seat
and
said
be
not
surprised
if
you
do
not
see
in
my
face
that
look
which
is
usual
to
me
and
that
joy
which
animates
me
whenever
i
meet
you
do
not
marvel
if
the
tricks
of
eloquence
are
foreign
to
my
speech
i
do
not
come
to
talk
to
you
of
myself
we
have
to
treat
this
day
of
an
offence
done
to
the
king
of
kings
it
is
proper
that
i
should
assume
another
style
and
language
another
look
and
countenance
for
i
do
not
speak
to
you
as
a
king
and
a
master
speaks
to
his
subjects
and
his
servants
but
as
being
a
subject
and
servant
myself
and
addressing
those
who
are
with
me
of
our
common
king
of
the
master
of
masters
who
is
god
almighty
what
honour
what
reverence
what
obedience
do
we
not
owe
to
that
great
king
what
obligations
does
not
this
kingdom
more
than
any
other
owe
to
him
seeing
that
for
thirteen
or
fourteen
hundred
years
he
has
maintained
it
in
peace
and
tranquillity
with
its
friends
and
in
victory
against
its
enemies
and
if
sometimes
for
sins
committed
against
his
divine
goodness
he
has
wished
to
visit
us
with
punishment
in
temporal
things
he
has
done
it
with
so
little
severity
that
he
has
never
exceeded
the
chastisement
which
a
kind
and
gracious
father
may
use
towards
the
faults
of
a
humble
and
obedient
son
but
as
for
spiritual
things
which
touch
the
holy
catholic
faith
god
has
never
forsaken
france
so
far
as
to
let
her
stray
ever
so
little
from
it
and
he
has
shown
her
this
favour
that
by
common
accord
she
has
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
being
the
only
power
that
has
never
nurtured
monsters
and
which
above
all
others
bears
the
name
and
title
of
most
christian
so
much
the
more
ought
we
to
feel
grief
and
regret
in
our
hearts
that
there
should
be
at
this
time
in
france
men
so
wicked
and
wretched
as
to
desire
to
soil
that
noble
name
who
have
disseminated
damnable
opinions
who
have
not
only
assaulted
the
things
which
our
great
king
desires
to
be
honoured
and
acted
so
evilly
that
they
do
not
leave
to
others
the
power
of
doing
worse
but
have
all
at
once
attacked
him
in
the
holy
sacrament
of
the
altar
people
of
low
condition
and
less
learning
wicked
blasphemers
have
used
with
regard
to
that
sacrament
terms
rejected
and
abhorred
by
every
other
nation
so
that
our
realm
and
even
this
good
city
of
paris
which
from
the
time
when
letters
were
transported
hither
from
athens
has
always
shone
in
sound
and
holy
learning
might
remain
scandalised
and
its
light
be
obscured
wherefore
we
have
commanded
that
severe
punishment
be
inflicted
on
the
delinquents
in
order
that
they
may
be
an
example
to
others
and
prevent
them
from
falling
into
the
like
damnable
opinions
and
we
entreat
the
misguided
ones
to
return
into
the
path
of
the
holy
catholic
faith
in
which
i
who
am
their
king
with
the
spiritual
prelates
and
temporal
princes
persevere
oh
the
crime
the
blasphemy
the
day
of
sorrow
and
disgrace
why
did
it
ever
dawn
upon
us
were
few
of
all
the
company
says
the
chronicle
whose
eyes
the
king
did
not
draw
tears
after
a
few
minutes
silence
interrupted
by
the
exclamations
and
sighs
of
the
assembly
the
king
resumed
is
at
least
a
consolation
that
you
share
my
sorrow
what
a
disgrace
it
will
be
if
we
do
not
extirpate
these
wicked
creatures
for
this
reason
i
have
summoned
you
to
beg
you
to
put
out
of
your
hearts
all
opinions
that
may
mislead
you
to
instruct
your
children
and
your
servants
in
the
christian
doctrine
of
the
catholic
faith
and
if
you
know
any
person
infected
by
this
perverse
sect
be
he
your
parent
brother
cousin
or
connection
give
information
against
him
by
concealing
his
misdeeds
you
will
be
partakers
of
that
pestilent
faction
the
assembly
gave
numerous
signs
of
assent
the
king
saw
the
devotion
zeal
and
affection
visible
in
their
faces
give
thanks
to
god
he
resumed
the
greatest
the
most
learned
and
undoubtedly
the
majority
of
my
subjects
and
especially
in
this
good
city
of
paris
are
full
of
zeal
for
the
catholic
religion
then
says
the
chronicle
you
might
have
seen
the
faces
of
the
spectators
change
in
appearance
and
give
signs
of
joy
acclamations
prevented
the
sighs
and
sighs
choked
the
acclamations
warn
you
continued
the
king
i
will
have
the
said
errors
expelled
and
driven
from
my
kingdom
and
will
excuse
no
one
then
he
exclaimed
says
our
historian
with
extreme
anger
true
messieurs
as
i
am
your
king
if
i
knew
one
of
my
own
limbs
spotted
or
infected
with
this
detestable
rottenness
i
would
give
it
you
to
cut
off
and
further
if
i
saw
one
of
my
children
defiled
by
it
i
would
not
spare
him
i
would
deliver
him
up
myself
and
would
sacrifice
him
to
god
sidenote
effects
of
the
royal
rhetoric
at
these
words
the
king
stopped
he
was
agitated
and
wept
the
spectators
affected
by
the
sight
of
this
new
abraham
burst
into
tears
after
the
interruption
necessarily
occasioned
by
this
moving

and

lord
of

and

him
for
his
first
in
the
name
of
the
clergy
the
other
on
behalf
of
the
swore
to
make
war
against

thereupon
all
the
spectators
exclaimed
with
voices
broken
by
sobbing
will
live
and
die
for
the
catholic
religion

of
the
of

was
probably
present
in
the
assembly
dwells
upon

emotion
caused
by
the

clearly
show

says

eloquent

powerful
man

at

will

those
of

terror
were
next
to
be
aroused
after
displaying

eloquence
the

was
about
to
display
his
cruelty
always
in
extremes
says
a
very
catholic
historian
not
disdain
to
pollute
his

with
a
spectacle
full
of
barbarity
and
horror

atrocious

a
little
farther
on
stood
an
altar
with
an
invocation
to
the
virgin
and
all
the
saints
to
give
help
strength
and
grace
against
the
attacks
of
the
enemies
of
the
host
in
other
places
were
four
stanzas
in
french
each
of
which
ended
with
this
line
france

the
king
with
his
family
the
nobles
and
the
rest
of
the
procession
having
resumed
his
march
made
his
first
halt
at
the
marksman
cross
morin
the
cruel
then
brought
forward
three
evangelical
christians
destined
to
be
burnt
appease
the
wrath
of
god
they
were
the
excellent
valeton
receiver
of
nantes
master
nicholas
clerk
to
the
registrar
of
the
châtelet
and
another
the
people
were
so
excited
by
the
procession
and
by
the
cries
raised
in
every
quarter
and
even
by
the
throne
against
the
reformers
that
when
the
martyrs
appeared
they
rushed
furiously
upon
them
to
snatch
them
from
the
hangman
hands
and
tear
them
to
pieces
the
guard
drove
them
back
and
the
disciples
of
the
gospel
were
preserved
for
a
more
frightful
death
sidenote
the
strappado
the
first
who
came
forward
was
that
brave
man
and
respectable
christian
nicholas
valeton
who
had
always
good
company
the
king
had
been
struck
with
the
circumstance
of
the
hiding
of
his
books
and
ordered
them
to
be
burnt
with
him
valeton
stood
in
front
of
the
pile
with
a
sort
of
refined
cruelty
the
wood
with
which
he
was
to
be
burnt
had
been
taken
from
his
own
house
but
this
kind
of
irony
did
not
affect
him
another
object
attracted
his
attention
it
was
a
kind
of
gallows
formed
of
two
poles
one
fixed
firmly
in
the
ground
the
other
fastened
to
it
one
end
of
which
was
raised
at
will
by
means
of
a
cord
fastened
to
the
other
the
receiver
looked
calmly
at
this
instrument
of
punishment
to
which
they
were
about
to
fasten
him
to
make
him
soar
into
the
air
merely
to
burn
these
humble
christians
would
have
been
too
simple
the
employment
of
the
was
to
provide
the
people
with
a
more
varied
and
more
diverting
spectacle
the
priests
knowing
that
valeton
was
a
man
of
credit
and
that
he
was
moreover
rather
a
novice
in
heresy
desired
to
gain
him
they
approached
him
and
said
have
the
universal
church
with
us
out
of
it
there
is
no
salvation
return
to
it
your
faith
is
destroying
you
this
faithful
christian
replied
only
believe
in
what
the
prophets
and
the
apostles
formerly
preached
and
what
all
the
company
of
saints
believed
the
attacks
were
renewed
in
vain
faith
has
a
confidence
in
god
he
said
will
resist
all
the
powers
of
hell
the
good
people
who
were
scattered
among
the
crowd
admired
his
firmness
and
the
thought
that
he
left
a
bereaved
wife
behind
him
touched
many
a
heart
the
punishment
began
the
hangman
bound
his
hands
which
he
fastened
to
the
end
of
the
strappado
the
sufferer
was
then
raised
in
the
air
his
arms
alone
sustaining
the
whole
weight
of
his
body
the
pile
over
which
he
was
suspended
was
then
set
alight
and
they
proceeded
to
their
cruel
sport
the
executioners
let
the
unhappy
valeton
fall
plump
into
the
midst
of
the
flames
then
reversing
their
movements
they
raised
the
martyr
into
the
air
only
to
let
him
fall
again
into
the
fire
the
wretches
feel
that
they
are
dying
a
cruel
pagan
emperor
had
said
a
king
of
france
carried
out
this
order
and
enjoyed
it
with
all
his
court
somewhat
as
savages
do
when
they
burn
their
prisoners
after
several
turns
at
this
atrocious
sport
had
amused
the
king
the
priests
the
nobles
and
the
people
the
flames
caught
hold
of
the
martyr
from
his
feet
to
the
cord
that
bound
his
hands
the
knot
was
burnt
and
this
upright
witness
to
christ
fell
into
the
fire
where
his
body
was
reduced
to
ashes
this
inhuman
punishment
was
next
applied
by
order
of
the
king
to
the
two
other
martyrs
when
the
torture
had
lasted
long
enough
the
executioner
cut
the
rope
if
the
fire
had
not
consumed
it
in
order
that
the
victim
might
fall
at
last
into
the
flames
sidenote
tortures
at
the
halles
francis
and
his
courtiers
were
not
yet
satisfied
the
halles
to
the
halles
was
the
cry
and
a
mass
of
curious
people
rushed
thither
knowing
that
the
executioners
had
prepared
a
second
entertainment
of
a
similar
kind
the
king
and
his
train
had
scarcely
arrived
when
they
began
to
set
the
frightful
strappado
in
motion
a
man
known
and
highly
esteemed
throughout
the
quarter
a
rich
of
the
halles
had
been
fastened
to
it
and
after
him
two
other
evangelical
christians
were
served
in
the
same
way
francis
and
his
court
witnessed
the
convulsions
of
the
sufferers
and
could
smell
the
stench
of
their
burning
flesh
there
were
no
doubt
among
the
spectators
many
individuals
feeling
for
the
sufferings
of
others
but
surprising
to
say
there
was
not
a
sign
of
compassion
the
best
of
them
suppressed
the
most
legitimate
emotions
it
was
everybody
duty
to
think
that
as
a
jesuit
says
king
wished
to
draw
down
the
blessing
of
heaven
by
giving
this
signal
example
of
piety
and
zeal
francis
returned
satisfied
to
the
louvre
the
courtiers
around
him
declared
that
the
triumph
of
holy
church
was
for
ever
secured
in
the
kingdom
of
france
but
the
people
went
still
farther
they
displayed
a
cruel
joy
the
deaths
of
the
heretics
had
furnished
them
with
an
unknown
enjoyment
it
was
long
before
the
thirst
for
blood
then
awakened
in
them
was
assuaged
they
had
just
played
the
first
act
of
a
drama
which
was
to
be
followed
by
others
bloodier
still
the
most
notorious
of
which
were
the
massacres
of
bartholomew
and
with
a
change
of
victims
the
massacres
of
september
certain
enraptured
clerks
thought
that
francis
surpassed
charles
and
exclaimed
edit
edicta
rex
edit
supplicia
francis
and
his
officers
felt
however
some
little
vexation
certain
victims
were
wanting
they
sought
everywhere
for
nobles
professors
priests
and
industrials
suspected
of
protestantism
whom
they
could
not
find
a
few
days
after
these
executions
on
the
january
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
was
heard
in
all
the
and
the
common
crier
lutherans
to
appear
in
person
in
default
thereof
they
were
declared
to
be
banished
from
the
kingdom
of
france
their
goods
confiscated
and
themselves
condemned
to
be
burnt
these
were
the
fugitives
whom
we
have
already
pointed
out
none
of
them
appeared
to
the
summons
but
one
of
them
wrote
to
the
king
they
call
me
name
i
have
no
right
to
bear
luther
for
me
did
not
come
down
from
heaven
for
me
no
luther
hung
upon
the
cross
for
all
my
sins
nor
was
i
in
his
name
baptised
but
in
the
name
of
him
alone
to
whom
th
eternal
father
grants
we
the
only
name
in
heaven
by
which
the
world
this
wicked
world
salvation
can
attain
but
the
king
was
far
from
pardoning
four
days
after
this
publication
january
he
issued
an
edict
the
extirpation
of
the
lutheran
sect
which
has
swarmed
and
is
still
swarming
in
the
realm
with
orders
to
denounce
its
followers
at
the
same
time
he
addressed
a
circular
letter
to
all
the
parliaments
enjoining
them
to
give
and
prisons
in
order
that
the
heresy
should
be
promptly
extirpated
lastly
the
of
letters
issued
an
ordinance
declaring
the
of
all
over
france
under
pain
of
the
gallows
this
savage
edict
was
not
carried
out
it
is
however
an
index
of
the
spirit
by
which
the
enemies
of
the
reformation
were
animated

for

and
the
king

them
back
to

round
and
round

and
at

unable

any

went
and
showed
it
to

two

were
keeping
watch
during
the
night
in
the

at
arras
in

there
was
a
candle
there
to

the

used
to
sing
hymns
because
the

told

was
often
sufficient
for
an
enemy
to
accuse
a
person
of
having
a
liking
for
the

immediately
the
police
laid
their

that

he
thought
only
of
the
victims
he
turned
towards
germany
where
he
had
so
many
friends
where
there
was
possibly
less
decision
than
in
france
but
a
deeper
and
more
inward
faith
he
thought
of
melanchthon
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
as
if
he
were
in
the
presence
of
that
man
poured
all
his
sorrows
into
his
bosom
the
letters
which
i
have
sometimes
written
you
on
the
affairs
of
this
country
have
been
agreeable
to
you
he
said
you
then
desired
that
all
should
go
well
for
good
men
what
uneasiness
what
anxiety
must
not
your
heart
feel
in
this
hour
of
furious
tempests
and
extreme
danger
we
were
in
the
best
the
finest
position
thanks
to
wise
men
and
now
behold
us
through
the
advice
of
unskilful
men
fallen
into
the
greatest
calamity
and
supreme
misery
i
wrote
you
last
year
that
everything
was
going
on
well
and
what
hopes
we
entertained
from
the
king
equity
we
congratulated
one
another
but
alas
extravagant
men
have
deprived
us
of
those
propitious
times
one
night
in
the
month
of
october
in
a
few
moments
all
over
france
and
in
every
corner
they
posted
with
their
own
hands
a
placard
concerning
the
ecclesiastical
orders
the
mass
and
the
would
think
they
were
rehearsing
a
tragedy
carried
their
audacity
so
far
as
to
fasten
one
even
on
the
door
of
the
apartments
wishing
by
this
means
as
it
would
seem
to
cause
certain
and
atrocious
dangers
since
that
rash
act
everything
has
been
changed
the
people
are
troubled
the
thoughts
of
many
are
filled
with
alarm
the
magistrates
are
irritated
the
king
is
excited
and
frightful
trials
are
going
on
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
these
imprudent
men
if
they
were
not
the
cause
were
at
least
the
occasion
of
this
only
if
it
were
possible
for
the
judges
to
preserve
a
just
mean
some
having
been
seized
have
already
undergone
their
punishment
others
promptly
providing
for
their
safety
have
fled
innocent
people
have
suffered
the
chastisement
of
the
guilty
informers
show
themselves
publicly
any
one
may
be
both
accuser
and
witness
these
are
not
idle
rumours
that
i
write
to
you
melanchthon
be
assured
that
i
do
not
tell
you
all
and
that
in
what
i
write
i
do
not
employ
the
strong
terms
that
the
terrible
state
of
our
affairs
would
require
already
eighteen
disciples
of
the
gospel
have
been
burnt
and
the
same
danger
threatens
a
still
greater
number
every
day
the
danger
spreads
wider
and
wider
there
is
not
a
good
man
who
does
not
fear
the
calumnies
of
informers
and
is
not
consumed
with
grief
at
the
sight
of
these
horrible
doings
our
adversaries
reign
and
with
all
the
more
authority
that
they
appear
to
be
fighting
in
a
just
cause
and
to
quell
sedition
in
the
midst
of
these
great
and
numerous
evils
there
is
only
one
hope
the
people
are
beginning
to
be
disgusted
with
such
cruel
persecutions
and
that
the
king
blushes
at
last
at
having
thirsted
for
the
blood
of
these
unfortunate
men
the
persecutors
are
instigated
by
violent
hatred
and
not
by
justice
if
the
king
could
but
know
what
kind
of
spirit
animates
these
bloodthirsty
men
he
would
no
doubt
take
better
advice
and
yet
we
do
not
despair
god
reigns
he
will
scatter
all
these
tempests
he
will
show
us
the
port
where
we
can
take
refuge
he
will
give
good
men
an
asylum
they
will
dare
speak
their
thoughts
sidenote
luther
letter
this
letter
to
melanchthon
is
important
in
the
history
of
the
reformation
liberty
of
speech
and
of
religious
action
is
what
protestantism
claimed
in
france
and
in
claiming
these
liberties
for
itself
it
secured
them
for
all
we
may
imagine
what
an
impression
this
letter
produced
at
wittemberg
melanchthon
who
received
it
and
even
luther
himself
blamed
a
certain
excess
of
vivacity
in
the
french
reformers
but
like
sturm
they
recognised
in
them
disciples
of
the
divine
word
a
few
days
after
luther
writing
to
his
friend
link
complained
of
the
evil
times
in
which
they
lived
and
especially
of
the
kings
the
exception
of
our
prince
the
elector
of
saxony
he
said
is
not
one
whom
i
do
not
suspect
you
may
understand
by
this
language
how
little
love
and
zeal
for
the
word
of
god
there
is
in
this
world
for
the
present
sing
i
pray
you
this
psalm
expectavi
i
waited
patiently
for
the
lord
it
is
through
glory
and
disgrace
through
stumblings
and
strayings
through
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
through
devils
and
angels
that
we
come
to
him
who
alone
is
good
alone
is
without
evil
therefore
dear
brother
i
conjure
you
lend
no
ear
to
any
discourse
and
have
no
other
conversation
than
what
you
have
with
there
are
many
excellent
people
among
men
but
alas
they
have
less
patience
than
stern
justice
god
help
us
he
permits
the
devil
to
be
strong
and
how
weak
he
makes
us
god
puts
us
to
the
proof
to
trust
in
a
man
were
he
even
a
prince
is
not
conformable
with
piety
but
to
fear
a
man
is
shameful
and
even
impious
in
a
christian
may
christ
our
life
our
salvation
and
our
glory
be
with
you
and
all
yours
luther
did
not
name
francis
in
this
letter
but
it
is
well
known
that
of
all
princes
the
king
of
france
was
the
one
in
whom
he
had
the
least
hope
he
was
not
mistaken
from
this
time
francis
no
longer
showed
the
same
favour
to
learning
and
especially
to
evangelical
learning
the
excommunication
launched
against
henry
the
schism
which
followed
the
hope
of
seeing
paul
iii
embroiled
with
charles
and
other
motives
besides
made
him
incline
once
more
towards
rome
but
the
placards
were
the
principal
cause
of
this
change
his
wrath
was
unappeasable
he
was
determined
to
abolish
these
new
doctrines
which
were
paraded
even
on
the
gate
of
his
palace
his
indignation
broke
out
in
the
midst
of
his
courtiers
and
cardinals
bishops
and
councillors
of
parliament
nay
more
he
laid
it
even
before
the
protestant
princes
of
germany
writing
to
them
on
the
february
he
said
enemy
of
truth
has
stirred
up
certain
people
who
are
not
fools
but
madmen
and
who
have
incurred
the
guilt
of
sedition
and
other
antichristian
actions
i
am
determined
to
crush
these
new
doctrines
and
to
check
this
disease
which
leads
to
frightful
revolts
from
spreading
further
no
one
has
been
spared
whatever
his
country
or
his
rank
such
were
the
king
intentions
protestantism
and
with
it
liberty

was

raise
them

calvin
at
strasburg
with
erasmus
and
at
basle
summer
and
autumn
while
evangelical
light
seemed
on
the
point
of
extinction
in
france
one
of
her
sons
was
going
to
kindle
a
torch
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
afterwards
on
those
of
the
rhone
which
would
spread
its
bright
rays
far
and
wide
calvin
had
arrived
at
strasburg
sidenote
calvin
mission
he
who
was
to
be
the
true
doctor
of
the
reformation
its
great
captain
was
then
in
search
of
knowledge
and
of
arms
in
order
to
teach
and
to
fight
this
as
we
have
said
was
the
principal
motive
that
induced
him
to
leave
france
like
all
noble
characters
who
have
played
an
important
part
in
history
calvin
felt
his
vocation
he
wished
to
labour
at
the
renewal
of
the
church
and
in
order
to
do
this
he
must
interpret
holy
scripture
and
explain
the
body
of
christian
doctrine
hitherto
he
had
preached
the
gospel
like
an
ordinary
believer
he
had
sown
the
word
in
a
few
insulated
orleans
bourges
angoulême
noyon
and
paris
now
without
his
being
conscious
of
it
a
wider
sphere
was
opening
before
him
and
he
was
going
to
learn
the
truth
of
christ
declaration
field
is
the
there
was
a
void
space
in
christendom
and
god
called
him
to
fill
it
he
was
to
create
the
new
the
living
theology
of
modern
times
france
where
scholasticism
was
the
only
theological
science
did
not
suffice
him
he
was
going
towards
germany
and
switzerland
where
the
love
and
study
of
holy
learning
had
arisen
with
power
he
saw
from
afar
the
lights
that
sparkled
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
on
the
plains
of
saxony
and
like
a
traveller
who
catches
sight
of
a
beacon
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
he
hurried
towards
the
places
whence
those
distant
rays
reached
his
eye
a
child
of
light
he
was
seeking
the
light
sidenote
the
college
and
matthew
zell
the
free
city
of
strasburg
possessed
an
intelligent
and
wise
magistrates
the
revival
of
learning
had
begun
there
in
the
fifteenth
century
shortly
after
luther
had
published
his
theses
at
wittemberg
the
echo
of
the
great
reformer
voice
was
heard
in
that
city
of
the
rhine
elementary
schools
were
immediately
established
monks
who
had
left
their
convents
and
priests
who
were
disenchanted
from
their
ancient
superstitions
aided
by
pious
and
devout
artizans
undertook
the
education
of
the
children
a
latin
college
was
founded
in
where
the
canons
of
thomas
and
other
learned
christians
had
begun
a
superior
kind
of
instruction
the
new
life
then
spreading
through
the
church
circulated
vigorously
in
strasburg
it
fermented
in
a
more
especial
manner
in
capito
bucer
and
hedio
they
conversed
together
communicating
to
each
other
the
faith
by
which
they
were
animated
it
was
the
spring
sap
pushing
forth
blossoms
and
giving
promise
of
fruit
capito
eloquently
expounded
the
books
of
the
old
testament
bucer
explained
those
of
the
new
with
much
wisdom
hedio
taught
history
and
theology
caselius
hebrew
and
herlin
the
art
of
speaking
professor
john
sturm
then
at
paris
and
the
friend
of
melanchthon
was
about
to
be
put
at
the
head
of
the
educational
work
in
his
native
city
there
was
a
pious
man
at
strasburg
whose
house
was
known
to
all
christian
travellers
and
especially
to
the
exiles
he
was
matthew
zell
pastor
of
the
church
of
lawrence
when
calvin
and
du
tillet
arrived
in
the
capital
of
alsace
they
were
in
great
distress
having
been
robbed
of
their
money
as
we
have
seen
in
this
imperial
city
with
all
its
beautiful
buildings
over
which
soars
the
magnificent
cathedral
they
knew
not
where
to
go
the
name
of
zell
was
familiar
to
calvin
as
well
as
his
generous
hospitality
he
knocked
at
his
door
we
are
told
and
was
cordially
received
calvin
and
zell
were
very
different
characters
but
they
appreciated
each
other
and
when
the
reformer
was
settled
at
geneva
he
did
not
neglect
to
salute
zell
in
his
letters
to
bucer
zell
was
a
man
of
practical
and
conciliatory
spirit
and
did
not
trouble
himself
much
with
theological
discussions
he
cared
only
for
his
dear
parishioners
and
was
very
popular
bucer
thought
even
too
much
so
alone
has
the
people
with
him
he
said
to
this
day
his
name
is
mentioned
with
affection
in
alsace
as
early
as
he
preached
the
gospel
at
strasburg
and
with
such
unction
and
zeal
that
an
immense
crowd
surrounded
his
pulpit
being
a
man
of
generous
disposition
he
boldly
defended
those
who
were
called
heretics
you
know
why
they
are
attacked
he
said
their
enemies
are
afraid
that
the
indulgences
and
purgatory
which
they
condemn
will
bring
them
in
no
more
money
prosecuted
by
his
bishop
in
he
defended
himself
with
spirit
and
escaped
with
losing
his
post
of
confessor
to
the
prelate
sidenote
the
pastor
wife
calvin
and
du
tillet
soon
noticed
his
partner
catherine
schulz
daughter
of
a
carpenter
in
the
city
a
clever
intelligent
active
firm
woman
who
had
managed
to
obtain
the
ascendant
over
everyone
and
a
little
too
much
so
over
her
husband
the
young
reformer
saw
in
her
one
of
the
types
of
the
christian
woman
who
cumbereth
herself
who
receiveth
the
prophets
honourably
but
who
while
doing
good
sometimes
values
herself
more
highly
than
she
does
others
catherine
soul
was
troubled
for
a
long
time
she
doubted
of
her
salvation
at
last
the
voice
of
luther
reached
her
and
brought
her
peace
persuades
me
so
thoroughly
of
the
ineffable
goodness
of
jesus
christ
she
exclaimed
i
feel
as
if
i
were
dragged
from
the
depths
of
hell
and
transported
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
day
and
night
i
will
now
tread
the
path
of
truth
from
that
hour
catherine
resolutely
dedicated
herself
to
the
practice
of
good
works
the
pastor
of
lawrence
often
had
a
large
number
of
persecuted
christians
seated
round
his
table
and
kept
them
in
his
house
for
many
weeks
one
night
he
received
pious
men
from
a
little
town
of
brisgau
who
having
left
their
homes
in
the
middle
of
the
night
had
arrived
in
great
distress
at
strasburg
catherine
found
means
to
lodge
fourscore
of
them
in
the
parsonage
and
for
a
month
had
fifty
or
sixty
of
them
daily
at
her
table
even
when
her
house
was
full
she
displayed
the
most
unceasing
activity
abroad
caring
neither
for
dress
nor
worldly
recreations
the
pastor
wife
visited
the
houses
of
the
poor
nursed
the
sick
wrapped
the
dead
in
their
comforted
the
prisoners
and
organised
collections
in
favour
of
the
refugees
was
never
weary
in
in
the
midst
of
her
zeal
however
she
took
too
much
credit
to
herself
one
day
recounting
her
merits
she
said
have
conscientiously
assisted
my
beloved
matthew
in
his
ministry
and
in
the
management
of
his
house
i
have
loved
the
company
of
the
learned
i
have
embraced
the
interests
of
the
lord
church
hence
all
the
pastors
and
a
great
number
of
distinguished
men
testify
their
affection
and
respect
for
me
catherine
did
not
know
all
that
these
men
thought
of
her
the
colour
would
have
mounted
to
her
cheeks
could
she
have
seen
a
certain
letter
from
bucer
to
blaurer
of
the
november
in
which
that
celebrated
strasburg
doctor
complains
of
zell
wife
is
so
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
herself
or
if
that
letter
of
the
of
february
had
been
brought
to
her
in
which
her
friend
wrote
of
her
like
all
of
us
is
too
fond
of
herself
at
the
time
of
calvin
arrival
in
strasburg
bucer
was
much
tormented
by
catherine
spirit
of
domination
perhaps
he
should
have
understood
that
her
defects
were
but
the
exaggeration
of
her
good
qualities
he
complained
of
her
influence
over
her
husband
zell
is
certainly
pious
he
said
he
is
ruled
by
his
wife
another
time
he
said
ought
to
preach
faith
more
fully
more
earnestly
but
his
wife
drives
him
to
care
for
nothing
but
works
the
zealous
bucer
who
was
so
often
journeying
to
reconcile
christians
and
churches
could
not
endure
that
zell
should
think
only
of
his
parish
should
see
nothing
but
his
dear
strasburg
and
ascribed
even
that
to
catherine
said
he
matthew
were
but
more
zealous
for
the
unity
of
the
church
and
yet
bucer
esteemed
him
highly
and
called
him
man
and
of
upright
heart
zell
and
catherine
were
in
those
reformation
times
a
christian
pair
worthy
to
figure
in
history
notwithstanding
their
failings
perhaps
however
calvin
recollected
catherine
character
when
he
reckoned
patience
and
gentleness
among
the
foremost
qualities
he
should
look
for
in
a
wife
calvin
already
knew
by
reputation
the
eminent
men
who
were
living
in
strasburg
he
was
never
tired
of
seeing
and
hearing
them
both
at
their
own
houses
and
at
matthew
zell
he
admired
in
bucer
with
whom
he
had
corresponded
and
whom
he
afterwards
called
his
father
a
noble
heart
a
peaceful
spirit
a
penetrating
mind
and
an
untiring
activity
capito
was
not
less
attractive
to
him
calvin
knew
that
disgusted
with
the
intrigues
of
the
court
he
had
left
the
elector
of
mentz
and
in
had
gone
to
strasburg
in
search
of
evangelical
liberty
and
from
that
hour
had
watched
with
interest
the
movements
of
the
gospel
in
france
he
was
therefore
impatient
to
see
a
man
who
by
the
extent
of
his
learning
and
the
nobility
of
his
character
held
the
first
rank
in
the
learned
city
where
he
resided
and
fortunately
capito
who
went
to
wisbaden
towards
the
end
of
august
was
still
at
strasburg
when
the
reformer
passed
through
it
all
these
doctors
joyfully
saw
france
bringing
her
tribute
at
last
to
the
work
of
christian
instruction
they
were
struck
with
calvin
seriousness
with
the
greatness
of
his
character
the
depth
of
his
thoughts
and
the
liveliness
of
his
faith
and
the
young
doctor
for
his
part
drank
in
with
delight
that
perfume
of
learning
and
piety
which
exhaled
from
the
conversation
and
life
of
these
men
of
god
sidenote
deficiencies
in
the
theologians
one
thing
however
checked
him
in
his
opinion
the
strasburg
reformers
observed
too
strict
a
middle
path
and
sometimes
sacrificed
truth
to
prudence
calvin
was
troubled
at
this
by
not
breaking
completely
with
rome
were
they
not
preparing
the
way
to
return
to
it
he
was
all
the
more
alarmed
as
the
young
canon
of
angoulême
had
a
great
inclination
for
this
middle
way
calvin
who
would
have
desired
to
put
du
tillet
in
connection
with
decided
reformers
saw
the
three
doctors
of
strasburg
and
especially
bucer
holding
out
their
hands
to
melanchthon
to
reunite
popery
and
the
reformation
could
he
have
led
him
into
a
snare
find
learning
and
piety
in
bucer
and
capito
he
said
one
day
they
force
me
to
desire
in
them
firmness
and
constancy
we
must
be
no
doubt
but
not
so
as
to
spend
the
wealth
of
another
and
what
precautions
ought
we
not
to
take
when
it
is
a
question
of
spending
god
truth
he
did
not
give
it
us
that
we
should
contract
it
in
any
way
true
these
words
are
found
in
a
document
of
later
date
but
already
the
wavering
du
tillet
was
approaching
the
gulf
into
which
he
was
to
fall
calvin
made
up
for
his
disappointments
by
devoting
himself
lovingly
to
the
french
refugees
at
strasburg
he
consoled
them
succoured
them
and
gave
them
very
trusty
counsel
to
strengthen
his
exiled
was
the
work
of
his
whole
life
must
be
in
this
world
he
said
if
we
do
not
quit
the
but
blessed
are
those
who
rather
than
fall
away
from
the
faith
freely
forsake
their
homes
and
leave
their
earthly
comforts
to
dwell
with
christ
calvin
did
not
remain
long
at
strasburg
did
he
fear
the
influence
of
that
city
upon
his
friend
or
did
he
find
too
many
occupations
and
disturbances
which
prevented
his
giving
all
his
time
to
the
work
to
which
he
wished
to
dedicate
himself
i
think
so
but
there
was
something
else
he
understood
that
instead
of
receiving
knowledge
from
the
hand
of
others
he
must
personally
work
the
mine
of
scripture
and
dig
up
the
precious
gems
that
it
contained
he
wished
like
the
bee
to
extract
a
store
of
the
purest
honey
from
the
abundance
of
the
flowers
of
the
divine
word
he
had
had
enough
of
travelling
of
disagreements
of
struggles
and
of
persecution
his
soul
longed
for
solitude
and
quiet
study
god
said
he
me
in
some
obscure
corner
where
i
may
at
last
enjoy
the
repose
so
long
denied
me
calvin
departed
for
basle
sidenote
erasmus
erasmus
as
we
know
had
long
resided
in
that
city
calvin
desired
to
see
him
he
was
beyond
all
doubt
much
more
a
man
of
compromises
than
bucer
and
from
timidity
rather
than
principle
he
inclined
to
the
side
of
the
papacy
he
was
however
a
great
scholar
had
he
not
published
the
new
testament
in
greek
having
left
basle
at
the
moment
of
the
triumph
of
the
reformation
there
he
happened
just
at
this
time
to
be
at
friburg
in
brisgau
on
the
road
from
strasburg
to
switzerland
could
calvin
pass
so
near
the
town
where
he
lived
who
had
the
of
the
reformation
and
not
try
to
see
him
a
writer
of
the
sixteenth
century
has
given
an
account
of
the
interview
between
these
two
men
in
the
department
of
letters
the
other
in
that
of
the
greatest
personages
of
the
day
bucer
desired
to
accompany
calvin
and
introduce
him
to
erasmus
the
precaution
was
almost
necessary
the
old
doctor
was
wishing
to
die
in
peace
with
rome
paul
iii
had
hardly
been
proclaimed
pope
when
he
who
had
kindled
the
fire
offered
his
good
services
to
him
in
order
to
maintain
the
faith
and
restore
peace
to
the
church
his
letter
quite
charmed
the
crafty
pontiff
know
paul
answered
useful
your
excellent
learning
combined
with
your
admirable
eloquence
may
be
to
me
in
rescuing
many
minds
from
these
new
errors
the
pope
even
had
some
idea
of
sending
erasmus
a
cardinal
hat
sidenote
calvin
meets
erasmus
calvin
had
not
chosen
his
time
well
yet
erasmus
received
him
though
not
without
some
little
embarrassment
the
young
reformer
impatient
to
hear
the
oracle
of
the
age
began
to
ask
him
numerous
questions
on
difficult
points
erasmus
fearing
to
commit
himself
was
reserved
and
gave
only
vague
answers
his
interlocutor
was
not
discouraged
had
not
the
scholar
of
rotterdam
said
that
the
only
remedy
for
the
evils
of
the
church
was
the
intervention
of
christ
himself
that
was
precisely
calvin
idea
and
therefore
following
it
up
he
explained
his
convictions
with
considerable
energy
erasmus
listened
with
astonishment
he
perceived
at
last
that
the
young
man
would
not
only
go
farther
than
himself
but
even
than
luther
and
would
wage
a
merciless
war
against
all
human
traditions
the
scholar
to
whom
the
pope
had
offered
the
roman
purple
became
alarmed
he
looked
at
calvin
with
astonishment
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
and
approaching
bucer
whispered
in
his
ear
magnam

ecclesia
contra
erasmus
broke
with
the
french
reformer
as
he
had
broken
with
the
german
reformer
the
two
visitors
withdrew
we
believe
the
account
of
this
interview
to
be
authentic
in
opposition
to
bayle
who
carries
his
sceptical
spirit
everywhere
calvin
might
have
been
proud
of
this
opinion
of
erasmus
his
censure
might
appear
to
him
praise
and
his
praise
censure
as
the
poet
says
luther
had
said
pope
i
will
be
thy
pestilence
and
death
calvin
and
du
tillet
arrived
at
basle
that
city
possessed
a
university
with
distinguished
scholars
good
theologians
and
celebrated
printers
but
calvin
did
not
knock
at
any
of
their
doors
in
a
there
lived
one
catherine
klein
a
pious
woman
who
took
delight
in
serving
god
and
loved
to
wash
the
feet
of
the
saints
as
the
gospel
says
it
was
her
house
the
young
doctor
sought
coming
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
the
two
friends
crossed
the
famous
bridge
which
unites
little
basle
to
the
old
city
and
knocked
at
this
pious
woman
door
here
calvin
found
obscure
corner
he
had
so
longed
for
catherine
received
him
with
frankness
and
soon
learnt
the
worth
of
the
man
she
had
in
her
house
she
was
not
one
of
those
women
who
from
vanity
and
coquet
to
use
calvin
own
words
but
of
those
who
having
the
fear
of
god
before
their
eyes
are
honest
and
chaste
in
their
appearance
distinguished
by
her
virtues
and
piety
she
loved
to
listen
to
calvin
and
never
grew
weary
of
admiring
the
beauty
of
his
genius
the
holiness
of
his
life
the
integrity
of
his
doctrines
and
the
zeal
with
which
he
applied
day
and
night
to
study
calvin
seemed
like
a
lighted
candle
in
her
house
and
thirty
years
later
receiving
as
a
lodger
a
man
who
was
to
be
one
of
the
victims
of
the
estimable
woman
took
pleasure
in
describing
to
him
the
reformer
mode
of
life
the
illustrious
philosopher
uniting
his
voice
with
that
of
the
aged
catherine
and
standing
in
the
very
chamber
that
calvin
had
occupied
apostrophized
the
reformer
as
light
of
france
the
light
of
the
christian
church
all
over
the
world
in
the
early
part
of
his
stay
at
basle
calvin
appears
to
have
seen
nobody
but
his
hostess
and
his
inseparable
friend
louis
du
tillet
he
avoided
all
acquaintanceships
that
might
have
led
to
his
being
recognised
and
he
went
out
but
seldom
sometimes
however
he
and
his
friend
would
climb
the
hills
which
rise
above
the
rhine
and
contemplate
the
magnificence
of
that
calm
and
mighty
river
whose
waters
are
ever
flowing
onwards
with
nothing
to
interrupt
their
majestic
course

inward
work
in
calvin
it
was
not
fear
of
persecution
that
led
calvin
to
hide
himself
he
was
in
a
free
city
but
he
had
need
to
put
himself
out
of
the
reach
of
the
strange
winds
of
doctrine
that
were
then
rushing
over
the
world
and
of
all
the
sensations
of
one
of
the
most
troubled
periods
of
history
he
wished
to
withdraw
himself
from
earthly
noises
and
hear
only
the
voice
of
god
and
the
music
of
heaven
rapid
emotions
now
sorrowful
now
joyful
continually
repeated
as
he
had
so
often
felt
in
paris
neutralised
each
other
and
left
nothing
in
his
heart
he
wished
to
fix
his
looks
on
high
and
give
the
thoughts
which
descended
to
him
from
heaven
the
time
to
lay
firm
hold
upon
his
mind
and
become
transformed
into
a
strong
and
unchangeable
affection
which
would
become
the
soul
of
his
whole
life
he
had
already
learnt
much
but
it
was
not
sufficient
for
him
to
learn
he
must
create
that
was
the
vocation
he
had
received
from
his
master
and
to
that
end
he
must
concentrate
all
the
strength
of
his
intelligence
and
of
his
heart
when
god
desires
to
form
the
ripe

the

forces
of
different

combine
to
fecundate
the

night
or
the
heat
of

day
the
earth
imparts
her
juices
the

it
and

such
was
the
inner
process
then
going
on
in
the

divine
and
human
forces
were
combining
to
bring
to
maturity
all
the
germs
of
beauty
and
strength
that

had
deposited
in
his
heart
will
and
understanding
and
to
render
his
genius
capable
of
undertaking
and
accomplishing
a
great
work
in
the
world
calvin
felt
that
he
needed
silence
and
concentration
destined
to
become
one
of
god
mightiest
instruments
for
his
age
and
all
ages
to
come
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
live
alone
with
god
that
he
should
have
god
in
him
and
that
the
divine
warmth
should
so
melt
and
purify
all
his
natural
energies
as
to
fit
him
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
immense
task
said
he
without
thinking
of
himself
wishing
to
publish
his
law
by
moses
led
him
to
sinai
and
took
him
into
his
heavenly
closet
many
of
god
ministers
have
after
moses
been
thus
prepared
for
the
work
of
their
office
luther
had
been
carried
away
to
the
wartburg
basle
was
calvin
wartburg
still
more
than
angoulême
he
had
however
one
acquaintance
or
rather
an
intimate
friend
in
that
city
this
was
nicholas
cop
of
the
university
of
paris
and
now
a
refugee
at
basle
how
could
calvin
who
had
been
the
innocent
cause
of
his
exile
remain
long
within
the
same
walls
without
seeing
him
while
preserving
his
incognito
with
respect
to
the
public
he
called
upon
his
dear
and
the
latter
saw
that
pale
familiar
face
enter
his
room
the
friends
now
visited
each
other
and
conversed
together
but
mystery
for
some
time
longer
shrouded
the
person
of
the
young
reformer
sidenote
grynæus
and
calvin
one
day
however
calvin
spoke
to
cop
of
an
eminent
man
then
in
basle
this
was
simon
grynæus
melanchthon
schoolfellow
who
in
had
escaped
with
difficulty
from
the
violent
attacks
of
the
papists
of
spire
and
had
been
invited
to
basle
to
take
erasmus
place
versed
in
latin
greek
philosophy
and
mathematics
said
melanchthon
possessed
a
mildness
of
temper
that
was
never
put
out
and
an
almost
excessive
bashfulness
and
yet
he
has
been
compared
the
splendour
of
the
sun
that
overpowers
the
light
of
the
stars
calvin
knew
grynæus
by
repute
he
met
him
and
was
captivated
by
his
amiable
and
gentle
disposition
grynæus
on
his
side
loved
calvin
and
the
two
scholars
often
shut
themselves
up
together
in
their
room
remember
well
wrote
calvin
to
grynæus
in
after
years
we
used
to
talk
in
private
on
the
best
mode
of
interpreting
scripture
chief
merit
in
an
interpreter
said
the
basle
professor
an
easy
brevity
without
obscurity
it
is
the
rule
calvin
followed
at
this
time
under
the
direction
of
grynæus
he
studied
hebrew
literature
more
thoroughly
calvin
residence
at
basle
soon
became
known
even
to
strangers
and
the
unseasonable
visits
which
interfered
with
his
studies
and
which
he
so
much
dreaded
began
again
one
day
a
total
stranger
called
upon
him
he
came
he
said
on
the
part
of
one
christopher
libertet
surnamed
fabri
a
student
of
montpelier
who
had
quitted
medicine
for
the
ministry
and
whom
we
shall
meet
again
in
switzerland
as
has
desired
me
to
inform
you
said
the
unknown
he
does
not
entirely
approve
of
certain
passages
in
your
book
on
the
of
the
this
message
from
a
student
delivered
by
a
stranger
might
have
offended
calvin
his
work
was
a
great
success
the
power
of
conviction
stamped
on
it
the
weight
of
the
proofs
the
force
of
the
arguments
drawn
from
scripture
its
lucidity
of
style
its
richness
of
thought
the
glow
of
light
that
shone
round
every
word
of
the
these
things
subjugated
its
readers
but
the
enthusiasm
of
some
of
his
friends
did
not
blind
the
author
to
the
imperfections
of
his
work
with
touching
humility
he
answered
fabri
who
had
not
long
left
school
from
being
displeased
at
your
opinion
your
simplicity
and
candour
have
delighted
me
much
my
temper
is
not
so
crabbed
as
refuse
to
others
the
liberty
i
enjoy
you
must
know
then
that
i
have
almost
entirely
my
book
this
letter
is
signed
the
name
probably
that
calvin
went
by
at
basle
the
date
the
contents
show
that
the
year
must
be
is
an
important
mark
in
the
reformer
life
visits
were
not
the
only
troubles
that
disturbed
calvin
solitude
his
incognito
had
hardly
ceased
before
he
was
attacked
by
anxieties
from
every
quarter
the
discords
which
broke
out
in
france
and
switzerland
filled
him
with
sorrow

at

on

a

was

by

at

it
was
a
small
folio
printed
in
double
columns

was
from

of

of

but
had
undergone
a
revision
with

to
certain
expressions
which
still
retained
a
romish
colouring
it
would
appear
that
this
edition
was
suppressed
either
because
it
had
been
made
without
resorting
to
the
original

or
because

it
was
reported
that
in

of
some
controversial
placards
which
had
been
posted
up
in
paris
and
throughout
france
the

anger
had
broken

the
placards

it
would

do

decidedly

they
may

the
stoics
must
have
been

when
they

there
are
fanatics
even
now
who
would

into

ask
for

why
then
should
we
not

permitted
to

lament

by

only
as

is

let
our
sorrow
be
moderated
by
hope
one
day
probably
in
december
or
january
calvin
saw
an
old
man
arrive
he
was
half
blind
and
felt
his
way
as
he
walked
towards
him
it
was
courault
who
liberated
from
prison
by
margaret
influence
had
escaped
from
the
convent
where
he
had
been
shut
up
it
was
a
great
joy
to
the
young
doctor
to
see
this
venerable
christian
again
whose
death
three
years
later
was
to
overwhelm
him
with
such
deep
distress
the
refugees
surrounded
courault
and
wanted
to
know
the
terrible
news
from
paris
he
had
not
witnessed
the
punishments
but
he
could
describe
them
and
cries
of
sorrow
rose
from
every
heart
courault
was
soon
followed
by
other
fugitives
for
some
weeks
there
was
a
little
repose
the
sky
was
heavy
and
threatening
but
silent
on
a
sudden
the
tempest
burst
out
again
the
bolts
fell
furiously
and
consumed
many
other
victims
about
the
end
of
january
the
news
of
the
martyrdoms
of
the
of
that
month
reached
basle
calvin
soul
was
perpetually
agitated
by
these
atrocious
persecutions
he
exclaimed
france
they
are
burning
many
faithful
and
holy
people
he
saw
them
fastened
to
the
swinging
in
the
air
plunged
into
the
flames
and
then
drawn
out
to
be
plunged
into
them
again
what
furious
rage
the
enemies
of
god
are
transported
he
said
though
horrible
curses
and
execrable
reproaches
are
hurled
upon
the
christians
from
every
side
they
continue
to
repose
firmly
on
the
grace
of
jesus
christ
having
confidence
that
they
will
be
safe
even
in
death
calvin
was
not
the
only
person
to
feel
these
keen
emotions
gibbets
were
set
up
in
various
parts
of
the
kingdom
says
mézeray
were
instituted
the
lutheran
preachers
and
those
who
had
listened
to
them
took
flight
and
in
a
few
months
there
were
more
than
a
hundred
refugees
who
carried
their
sorrows
and
their
complaints
to
the
courts
of
the
german
princes
their
tales
excited
great
indignation
in
germany
true
the
martyrs
were
often
calumniated
but
in
many
cities
the
refugees
from
beyond
the
rhine
were
able
to
refute
the
falsehoods
of
their
enemies
the
true
christians
were
not
deceived
and
they
recognised
the
victims
as
their
brethren
this
was
a
consolation
to
the
reformer
news
having
spread
to
foreign
nations
he
said
burnings
were
counted
very
wicked
by
a
large
number
of
germans
and
they
felt
great
bitterness
against
the
authors
of
such
tyranny

among
those
who
shared
calvin
sorrow
was
oswald
myconius
the
friend
of
zwingle
antistes
or
president
of
the
church
for
whom
the
reformer
entertained
an
affection
that
lasted
all
his
life
he
called
him
very
excellent
most
esteemed
brother
and
very
respected
friend
myconius
as
we
have
stated
elsewhere
was
a
distinguished
philosopher
and
pupil
of
erasmus
and
glareanus
while
residing
at
zurich
he
had
taught
the
classics
and
among
his
pupils
was
thomas
plater
but
the
disastrous
battle
of
cappel
had
made
him
renounce
this
duty
at
the
moment
when
plater
outstripping
the
fugitives
who
were
hurrying
from
the
fight
was
about
to
enter
the
city
he
encountered
myconius
who
was
pacing
backwards
and
forwards
before
the
gates
full
of
anguish
at
the
thought
of
the
dangers
incurred
by
zwingle
zurich
and
the
reformation
the
professor
had
hardly
caught
sight
of
his
pupil
when
running
up
to
him
he
asked
master
ulrich
dead
yes
answered
plater
myconius
struck
to
the
heart
stood
motionless
and
then
with
profound
sorrow
exclaimed
can
live
at
zurich
no
longer
plater
who
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
hours
went
home
with
myconius
who
gave
him
food
and
then
sat
down
by
him
silent
and
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
his
thoughts
at
last
myconius
took
him
into
his
room
and
said
to
him
with
consternation
must
i
go
the
pastor
of
church
at
basle
had
also
fallen
on
the
mountain
of
zug
to
basle
and
become
minister
there
said
plater
shortly
after
this
the
professor
and
his
pupil
set
out
on
foot
for
basle
where
they
arrived
after
many
adventures
and
alarms
a
few
days
later
myconius
was
called
upon
to
preach
the
which
was
delivered
at
six
in
the
morning
i
entered
his
room
on
the
morning
of
the
appointed
day
says
plater
found
him
still
in
bed
father
said
i
get
up
you
have
your
sermon
to
preach
what
is
it
said
myconius
and
jumped
out
of
bed
what
shall
be
the
subject
of
my
sermon
tell
me
i
can
not
i
insist
upon
your

our

it

inflicted

upon
a
piece
of
paper
i
obeyed
and
then
lent
him
my
testament
in
which
he
placed
the
memorandum
i
had
just
written
he
went
into
the
pulpit
and
spoke
eloquently
before
an
audience
of
learned
men
attracted
there
by
the
desire
to
hear
a
man
who
had
never
preached
before
all
were
filled
with
wonder
and
after
the
sermon
i
heard
doctor
simon
grynæus
say
to
doctor
sulterus
who
at
that
time
belonged
to
us
o

let
us
pray

man
to

myconius
was
nominated
pastor
of
alban
and
was
soon
after
called
to
replace
œcolampadius
as
president
of
the
church
at
basle
he
had
entertained
some
illusions
with
regard
to
francis
i
a
frenchman
a
strong
partisan
of
that
king
had
persuaded
him
that
francis
was
not
towards
the
gospel
that
if
he
dissembled
his
sentiments
it
was
only
because
of
the
prelates
of
his
kingdom
and
that
if
he
once
obtained
the
possessions
in
italy
which
he
coveted
it
would
be
seen
that
he
had
not
much
liking
either
for
the
pope
or
the
papists
myconius
was
struck
with
indignation
and
grief
when
he
heard
of
the
barbarous
executions
with
which
that
prince
had
feasted
the
eyes
of
the
citizens
of
paris
he
could
sympathise
all
the
more
with
calvin
as
although
a
man
of
mild
and
temperate
disposition
he
shared
in
the
decided
and
energetic
opinions
of
the
author
of
the
placards

patches
on
so
torn
a
garment
he
said
speaking
of
popery
should
never
meet
the
dragon
but
to
kill
him
a
great
unity
of
sentiment
drew
calvin
and
myconius
together
in
the
disastrous
times
of
which
we
are
speaking
the
burning
stakes
of
paris
drove
them
farther
from
rome
and
bound
them
closer
to
the
gospel
there
were
minds
however
upon
which
persecution
produced
a
very
different
effect
amid
all
this
indignation
and
sorrow
du
tillet
remained
shut
up
in
himself
and
silent
the
gentleness
of
the
word
of
god
attracted
him
but
the
bitterness
of
the
cross
terrified
him
he
had
quitted
everything
with
joy
believing
that
a
general
reform
of
the
church
would
be
carried
out
promptly
but
when
he
saw
a
mortal
combat
beginning
between
the
gospel
and
popery
felt
a
deep
emotion
he
lost
his
rest
as
he
tells
us
himself
suffered
inexpressible
trouble
and
anguish
of
mind
each
of
the
punishments
at
paris
added
to
the
doubts
and
agitation
of
that
candid
but
weak
nature
he
seemed
to
fear
schism
only
but
the
prospect
of
persecution
and
reproach
had
some
share
in
his
alarm
did
not
understand
as
calvin
says
while
bearing
the
cross
we
keep
christ
company
so
that
all
bitterness
is
sweetened
he
kept
himself
apart
he
passed
days
and
nights
filled
with
torture
have
been
lonely
and
without
rest

the
space
of
three
years
and
a
half

wrote
to
his
old
friend
in
his
intimacy
with
the
reformer
was
changed
and
three
years
later
he
was
to
cause
him
a
sorrow
as
great
nay
greater
no
doubt
than
that
which
calvin
had
felt
when
he
heard
of
the
deaths
of
the
martyrs
the
intrigues
of
the
agents
of
francis

to

thus
put

other
believers
i
will
endeavour
to
touch
foreign
nations
with
some
compassion
in
their
favour
such
was
the
reason
he
adds
moved
me
to
publish
the
of
the
christian
never
had
noble
book
so
noble
an
origin
justin
martyr
athenagoras
and
tertullian
had
written
their
by
the
light
of
the
stakes
of
the
second
century
calvin
wrote
his
by
the
light
of
those
of
the
sixteenth
the
publication
of
the
was
the
pitiful
cry
of
a
compassionate
soul
at
the
sight
of
those
who
were
going
to
the
stake
sidenote
theology
restored
calvin
had
long
meditated
the
great
subject
which
then
absorbed
system
of
christian
faith
and
his
book
was
to
be
the
finest
body
of
doctrine
ever
possessed
by
the
church
of
christ
during
four
centuries
reckoning
from
the
twelfth
minds
of
the
highest
order
had
formulated
abstract
systems
in
which
scholastic
rationalism
and
ecclesiastical
authority
were
habitually
combined
they
had
wasted
their
strength
in
running
after
expositions
contradictions
resolutions
conclusions
and
interminable
and
theology
was
lost
in
an
arid
wilderness
it
was
about
to
come
out
of
it
in
order
to
enter
into
new
lands
but
it
was
not
a
trifling
matter
to
make
christian
science
pass
from
death
to
life
from
darkness
to
light
it
required
an
awakened
conscience
a
heart
thirsting
for
righteousness
a
high
intelligence
and
a
powerful
will
boldly
to
break
through
all
the
to
scatter
to
the
winds
the
and
the
which
the
schoolmen
had
painfully
woven
out
of
their
brains
or
out
of
traditions
that
were
often
impure
and
to
set
up
in
their
place
the
living
rock
of
the
heavenly
word
on
which
the
temple
of
god
is
to
be
built
calvin
was
the
man
called
to
this
work
until
his
time
dogmatics
when
passing
from
one
period
to
another
had
always
advanced
in
the
same
direction
from
abstraction
to
abstraction
but
suddenly
the
course
was
changed
calvin
refused
to
tread
the
accustomed
road
instead
of
advancing
in
the
way
of
the
schoolmen
towards
new
developements
of
a
more
refined
intellectualism
he
turned
eagerly
backwards
he
heard
the
voice
of
conscience
he
felt
the
wants
of
the
heart
he
ran
whither
alone
they
can
be
satisfied
he
traversed
fifteen
centuries
he
went
to
the
gospel
springs
and
there
collecting
in
a
golden
cap
the
pure
and
living
waters
of
divine
revelation
presented
them
to
the
nations
to
quench
their
thirst
the
reformation
was
not
simply
a
change
in
the
doctrine
or
in
the
manners
or
in
the
government
of
the
church
it
was
a
creation
the
first
century
had
witnessed
the
first
christian
creation
the
fifteenth
century
witnessed
the
second
luther
by
the
power
of
his
faith
was
the
principal
organ
of
this
new
creation
freeing
himself
from
the
thick
darkness
that
had
hung
over
mankind
for
so
many
centuries
he
had
with
holy
energy
hurled
his
lightnings
and
thunderbolts
in
every
direction
around
him
so
that
all
the
horizon
was
lighted
up
calvin
appeared
he
gathered
up
these
scattered
flames
and
made
them
into
an
immense
fire
and
while
the
gleams
of
the
primitive
creation
of
the
church
had
been
confined
almost
entirely
within
the
limits
of
the
roman
world
the
fires
of
the
new
creation
are
spreading
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
calvin
retired
within
himself
to
meditate
on
the
work
to
which
god
called
him
he
turned
a
deep
glance
into
those
depths
of
scripture
which
he
had
so
often
sounded
holding
the
torch
of
the
spirit
he
summoned
before
him
the
great
persons
of
the
christian
economy
not
to
make
them
figure
as
the
schoolmen
had
done
in
a
learned
but
to
elicit
from
them
the
fundamental
truths
of
faith
and
plant
the
golden
columns
of
the
temple
of
light
and
life
sidenote
the
institutes
the
of
the
christian
is
calvin
great
achievement
it
is
calvin
himself
and
we
must
therefore
describe
it
history
indeed
generally
narrates
the
actions
performed
by
the
arm
of
the
soldier
or
the
negociations
of
the
diplomatist
but
the
work
that
calvin
then
accomplished
by
spiritual
force
far
exceeds
in
the
importance
of
its
consequences
all
that
has
ever
been
done
by
the
pens
of
the
ablest
statesmen
or
the
swords
of
the
bravest
warriors
let
us
describe
therefore
this
of
a
nature
apart
minds
as
calvin
calls
them
will
perhaps
pass
over
these
pages
we
regret
it
but
we
must
write
them
all
the
same
whole
sum
of
wisdom
said
the
great
doctor
of
modern
times
at
the
beginning
of
his
work
that
by
knowing
each
of
us
knows
also
and
these
two
facts
are
bound
to
each
other
by
so
many
ties
that
it
is
not
easy
to
discern
which
goes
before
and
produces
the
other
in
fact
calvin
when
addressing
man
shows
him
first
of
all
of
wonders
says
he
to
man
stamped
in
you
a
knowledge
of
himself
and
he
continually
refreshes
this
memory
in
you
as
if
he
poured
it
out
drop
by
drop
we
have
consciousness
of
divinity
graven
so
deeply
on
our
that
we
can
not
erase
it
the
rebellion
even
of
the
wicked
bears
testimony
of
this
for
while
combating
madly
to
throw
off
the
fear
of
god
that
fear
remains
inevitably
clinging
to
them
as
if
it
were
in
the
marrow
of
their
bones
but
after
ascribing
to
man
the
exquisite
privilege
of
bearing
the
name
of
god
within
him
calvin
immediately
brings
a
severe
charge
against
the
human
race
we
shall
hardly
find
in
a
hundred
that
cherishes
this
divine
seed
in
his
heart
some
through
curiosity
fly
away
in
vain
speculations
others
vanish
in
foolish
superstitions
others
finally
deprive
god
of
his
office
as
judge
and
governor
shut
him
up
idle
in
heaven
and
thus
remain
without
god
in
the
world
what
is
to
be
done
shall
we
toss
and
tumble
continually
carried
hither
and
thither
by
many
erroneous
levities
calvin
then
takes
man
by
the
hand
and
wishing
him
to
know
the
eternal
mysteries
places
him
before
a
vast
spiritual
mirror
the
holy
scriptures
where
all
invisible
things
appear
in
their
living
reality
thus
distinguishing
himself
from
all
the
doctors
of
catholicism
who
had
spoken
for
ten
centuries
he
puts
in
the
in
an
absolute
manner
the
full
sufficiency
and
sovereign
authority
of
the
word
of
god
said
he
opened
his
sacred
mouth
to
make
known
that
he
is
the
god
whom
we
should
adore
when
a
handsome
book
in
characters
is
set
before
those
who
have
weak
eyes
or
before
decrepit
old
men
they
can
hardly
read
two
words
consecutively
but
if
they
take
a
magnifying
glass
forthwith
they
read
everything
distinctly
if
we
wish
to
see
clearly
let
us
take
holy
scripture
without
it
we
have
but
a
confused
and
partial
knowledge
of
god
in
our
minds
but
that
drives
away
all
obscurity
in
us
and
shows
us
clearly
god
heart
already
in
the
time
of
calvin
there
were
certain
doctors
who
would
strip
the
bible
of
its
inspiration
and
christianity
of
its
supernaturalism
are
i
know
full
well
he
said
and
cavillers
and
mockers
who
attack
the
word
and
if
i
had
to
fight
out
this
quarrel
with
them
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
me
to
silence
their
cackling
but
in
addition
to
all
the
proof
that
reason
brings
there
is
one
above
all
others
it
is
necessary
that
the
same
spirit
which
has
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
the
prophets
should
enter
our
hearts
that
he
should
touch
them
to
the
quick
and
convince
them
that
the
prophets
have
faithfully
declared
what
had
been
enjoined
them
from
on
high
the
testimony
of
the
holy
is
the
proof
of
proofs
calvin
then
turns
to
man
the
who
puts
himself
in
the
place
of
god
and
reveals
to
him
the
sin
that
is
in
him
down
now
he
says
down
and
consider
thyself
learn
to
know
this
sin
derived
from
adam
and
dwelling
in
us
like
a
glowing
furnace
perpetually
throwing
out
flames
and
sparks
and
the
fire
of
which
not
only
burns
the
senses
but
pollutes
all
that
is
most
noble
in
our
souls
there
is
no
means
by
which
man
can
escape
of
himself
from
this
wretchedness
of
his
nature
thou
pretendest
to
rise
by
thy
own
strength
thou
standest
on
the
end
of
a
reed
that
snaps
immediately
then
calvin
shows
man
where
his
salvation
is
to
be
found
and
describes
with
grandeur
the
work
of
expiation
our
condemnation
holds
us
surprised
trembling
and
startled
before
the
judgment
seat
of
god
the
penalty
to
which
we
were
subject
has
been
laid
on
the
innocent
all
that
can
be
imputed
to
us
in
the
sight
of
god
is
transferred
upon
jesus
christ
the
divine
founder
of
the
kingdom
has
suffered
in
the
place
of
the
children
of
the
kingdom
our
peace
can
be
found
only
in
the
terrors
and
agony
of
christ
our
redeemer
but
how
does
this
work
accomplished
of
man
act
man
such
is
the
great
question
the
reformer
sets
himself
divine
faith
which
lays
hold
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
the
gives
birth
at
the
same
moment
to
the
holiness
of
christ
the
has
no
sooner
embraced
the
atonement
with
a
faith
full
of
confidence
he
says
he
experiences
an
unalterable
peace
in
his
conscience
he
possesses
a
spirit
of
adoption
which
makes
him
call
god
father
and
which
procures
him
a
sweet
and
joyful
communion
with
the
heavenly
father
immediately
the
least
drop
of
faith
is
put
into
our
souls
we
begin
to
contemplate
the
face
of
god
kind
and
favourable
to
us
true
we
see
it
from
afar
but
it
is
with
an
undoubting
eye
and
we
know
that
there
is
no
deception
a
new
question
is
here
started
the
young
doctor
is
asked
is
man
saved
by
charity
or
without
it
he
makes
answer
is
no
other
faith
which
justifies
save
that
which
is
united
with
charity
but
it
is
not
from
charity
that
it
derives
the
power
to
justify
faith
justifies
only
because
it
puts
us
in
communication
with
the
righteousness
of
christ
whosoever
confounds
the
two
righteousnesses
that
of
man
and
that
of
god
hinders
poor
souls
from
reposing
on
the
sole
and
pure
mercy
of
god
plaits
a
crown
of
thorns
for
jesus
christ
and
turns
his
sacrifice
to
ridicule
here
calvin
puts
forward
the
grand
idea
which
characterises
the
reformation
effected
by
his
teaching
namely
it
is
only
the
new
man
which
we
should
after
insisting
as
much
as
any
doctor
on
the
work
that
christ
does
he
insists
more
than
any
on
the
work
christ
must
do
exalt
to
the
highest
degree
he
says
conjunction
that
we
have
with
our
chief
dwelling
he
makes
in
our
hearts
by
faith
sacred
union
by
which
we
enjoy
him
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
perceive
in
our
lives
a
melody
and
harmony
between
the
righteousness
of
god
and
the
obedience
of
our
souls
but
calvin
observed
that
many
humble
timid
christians
were
distressed
because
they
experienced
only
a
weak
faith
these
he
consoles
and
the
images
he
employs
are
picturesque
any
one
shut
up
in
a
deep
dungeon
he
says
the
light
of
the
sun
obliquely
and
partially
through
a
high
and
narrow
window
he
would
not
certainly
have
a
sight
of
the
full
sun
yet
he
would
not
fail
to
receive
a
certain
quantity
of
light
and
to
enjoy
its
use
in
the
same
way
though
we
are
shut
up
in
the
prison
of
this
earthly
body
where
much
obscurity
surrounds
us
on
every
side
if
we
have
least
of
god
light
we
are
sufficiently
illuminated
and
may
have
a
firm
assurance
may
not
that
flame
be
extinguished
ask
christians
hesitatingly
said
calvin
light
of
faith
is
never
so
extinct
that
there
does
not
remain
some
glimmer
the
root
of
faith
is
never
so
torn
from
the
heart
that
it
does
not
remain
fastened
there
although
it
seems
to
lean
to
this
side
or
that
he
exclaimed
and
he
had
often
felt
it
is
an
armed
man
within
us
to
resist
the
attacks
of
the
evil
one
if
we
put
faith
in
the
front
she
receives
the
blows
and
wards
them
off
she
may
indeed
be
shaken
as
a
stalworth
soldier
may
be
compelled
by
a
violent
blow
to
step
backwards
her
shield
may
receive
damage
so
as
to
lose
its
shape
but
not
be
penetrated
and
even
in
this
extremity
the
shield
deadens
the
blow
and
the
weapon
does
not
pierce
to
the
heart
after
consoling
the
timid
and
uplifting
the
wounded
this
extraordinary
man
who
speaks
with
the
firmness
of
one
of
the
captains
of
the
army
of
god
exhorts
the
soldiers
of
christ
to
be
brave
john
promises
the
victory
to
our
faith
he
does
not
mean
simply
that
it
will
be
victorious
in
battle
or
in
but
in
be
full
of
courage
then
to
fluctuate
to
vary
to
be
tossed
to
and
fro
to
doubt
to
vacillate
to
be
kept
in
suspense
and
finally
to
despair
that
is
not
having
confidence
we
must
have
a
solid
support
on
which
we
can
rest
has
said
that
is
enough
being
under
the
safeguard
of
christ
we
are
in
no
danger
of
perishing
calvin
turning
to
rome
seeks
for
the
origin
of
its
errors
and
superstitions
and
finds
it
in
the
pelagianism
with
which
it
is
tainted
grace
in
all
its
fulness
from
the
first
movement
of
regeneration
until
the
final
accomplishment
of
salvation
was
the
keynote
of
all
calvin
theology
and
it
is
also
the
powerful
artillery
with
which
he
batters
the
roman
fortress
like
paul
in
the
first
century
like
augustine
in
the
fifth
calvin
is
the
of
in
the
sixteenth
this
is
one
of
his
essential
features
will
of
man
he
said
can
not
of
itself
incline
to
good
such
a
movement
which
is
the
beginning
of
our
conversion
to
god
scripture
entirely
attributes
to
the
holy
ghost
a
doctrine
not
only
useful
but
sweet
and
savoury
through
the
fruit
it
bears
for
those
who
do
not
know
themselves
to
be
members
of
the
peculiar
people
of
god
are
in
a
continual
trembling
no
doubt
the
wicked
find
in
it
a
matter
to
accuse
and
cavil
at
to
disparage
and
ridicule
but
if
we
fear
their
petulance
we
must
keep
silence
as
to
our
faith
for
there
is
not
a
single
article
which
they
do
not
contaminate
with
their
blasphemies
christ
he
continues
wishing
to
deliver
us
from
all
fear
in
the
midst
of
so
many
deadly
assaults
has
promised
that
those
who
have
been
given
him
by
his
father
to
keep
shall
not
perish
at
this
period
calvin
hears
a
clamour
raised
against
him
he
is
accused
of
maintaining
that
god
predestines
the
wicked
to
evil
and
he
replies
at
once
by
reprobating
such
an
impious
doctrine
mockers
jabber
against
god
he
says
that
the
wicked
are
unjustly
condemned
since
they
execute
only
what
god
has
determined
not
so
he
exclaims
from
having
obeyed
god
command
the
wicked
by
their
lusts
rebel
against
it
as
far
as
in
them
lies
there
must
be
no
fencing
with
god
there
must
be
no
saying
with
agamemnon
in
homer
speaking
of
evil
it
is
not
who
am
the
but
jupiter
and
fate
calvin
next
hastens
to
show
the
fruits
of
faith
have
given
the
first
rank
to
doctrine
he
said
to
be
useful
to
us
it
must
into
the
soul
pass
into
the
manners
and
regulate
the
actions
of
our
since
the
holy
ghost
consecrates
us
to
be
temples
of
god
we
must
take
pains
that
the
glory
of
god
fills
the
temple
we
know
those
babblers
who
are
content
with
having
the
gospel
on
their
lips
whilst
it
ought
to
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
soul
and
we
detest
their
babbling
calvin
had
carefully
studied
the
condition
of
the
church
during
the
middle
ages
what
had
he
found
there
the
separation
of
religion
and
morality
a
government
official
doctrines
ceremonies
but
all
stripped
of
moral
life
at
that
time
religion
was
a
tree
stretching
its
branches
wide
into
the
air
but
there
was
no
sap
flowing
through
them
to
restore
a
lively
faith
in
religion
and
through
faith
a
holy
morality
was
the
reformer
aim
he
said
impresses
on
our
hearts
the
love
of
to
which
we
are
not
inclined
by
nature
and
then
he
gives
us
a
certain
rule
which
does
not
permit
us
to
go
astray
accordingly
a
morality
unknown
for
ages
became
not
only
in
geneva
but
wherever
calvin
doctrine
penetrated
the
distinctive
feature
of
the
reformation
an
important
thought
however
still
absorbs
him
he
wishes
not
only
to
effect
certain
reforms
in
certain
articles
but
to
constitute
the
church
in
calvin
estimation
the
church
is
in
an
especial
manner
the
whole
assembly
of
the
children
of
god
but
he
acknowledges
also
as
having
a
right
to
this
name
the
visible
assembly
of
those
who
in
different
parts
of
the
world
profess
to
worship
the
lord
great
multitude
in
which
the
children
of
god
are
alas
but
a
handful
of
unknown
people
a
few
grains
on
the
under
a
great
heap
of
our
rudeness
our
idleness
and
the
vanity
of
our
minds
require
external
helps
he
added
and
for
that
reason
god
has
instituted
pastors
and
teachers
sidenote
appreciation
of
the
institutes
that
was
a
solemn
time
for
calvin
when
in
the
room
he
occupied
at
catherine
klein
he
finished
his
in
after
years
pious
christians
entered
her
house
with
respect
and
one
of
them
peter
ramus
being
there
in
five
years
after
the
reformer
death
exclaimed
with
emotion
were
kindled
the
torches
that
shed
so
great
a
light
here
those
illustrious
were
composed
and
here
calvin
gave
himself
up
wholly
to
heavenly
vigils
the
in
its
earliest
form
was
a
simple
defence
explaining
briefly
and
the
nature
of
the
and
but
the
french
refugees
at
geneva
and
even
distant
protestants
continually
solicited
calvin
to
set
forth
the
whole
christian
doctrine
in
his
book
and
accordingly
it
received
numerous
additions
the
are
a
proof
that
christian
love
prevailed
in
calvin
mind
indeed
he
wrote
for
the
justification
of
his
however
by
defending
the
reformed
he
explained
and
justified
the
reformation
itself
what
are
its
principles
the
formative
principle
of
faith
and
of
the
church
is
with
him
as
with
luther
the
sovereign
word
of
god
but
he
asserts
it
with
more
decision
than
his
predecessor
calvin
is
he
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
host
or
font
or
festivals
and
other
ceremonies
preserved
by
luther
he
did
not
the
church
he
it
he
created
it
anew
zwingle
also
was
scriptural
as
opposed
to
tradition
yet
theology
is
different
from
his
that
of
the
zurich
doctor
was
specially
exegetic
while
that
of
the
geneva
doctor
was
specially
dogmatic
if
from
the
formative
principle
we
pass
to
that
which
theologians
call
the
material
principle
namely
that
which
distinguishes
the
nature
and
very
essence
of
its
doctrine
we
find
that
it
is
at
heart
the
same
in
luther
and
salvation
but
the
former
clinging
to
christian
laid
down
as
a
fundamental
article
the
justification
by
faith
of
the
regenerate
man
whilst
calvin
clinging
particularly
to
to
the
doctrine
of
god
proclaimed
first
of
all
salvation
by
the
sovereignty
of
divine
grace
calvin
polemics
in
his
are
essentially
positive
like
a
master
in
the
midst
of
artists
who
are
endeavouring
to
draw
the
same
picture
calvin
traces
his
outline
with
a
bold
hand
distributes
the
light
and
shade
and
succeeds
in
making
an
admirable
work
and
from
that
time
his
rivals
have
only
to
look
at
it
to
acknowledge
the
imperfections
of
their
own
with
all
their
want
of
proportion
and
extravagance
calvin
destroys
what
is
ugly
but
he
first
creates
the
beautiful
the
were
admired
by
the
finest
spirits
of
the
age

calvin
addresses
the
king
and
departs
for
italy
august
the
object
of
the
was
to
make
known
to
christendom
and
particularly
to
the
protestants
of
germany
the
doctrines
professed
in
france
by
the
men
whom
the
king
was
putting
to
death
but
was
that
all
he
had
to
do
calvin
thought
he
saw
something
more
pressing
still
his
representations
instead
of
passing
through
germany
might
be
addressed
direct
to
the
king
in
his
anguish
and
solitary
meditations
he
had
often
asked
himself
why
he
should
not
do
it
directly
and
publicly
it
was
no
doubt
a
great
enterprise
for
a
persecuted
and
almost
unknown
young
man
to
address
that
powerful
monarch
who
was
mercilessly
throwing
his
best
subjects
into
the
flames
calvin
did
not
at
first
entertain
so
bold
a
project
later
he
said
to
the
king
thought
of
nothing
less
than
writing
things
to
be
laid
before
your
majesty
but
the
lamentable
spectacle
presented
by
france
was
night
and
day
before
his
eyes
and
knowing
that
the
same
fate
was
hanging
over
the
heads
of
all
who
desired
no
other
mediator
but
christ
was
it
right
for
him
to
be
silent
in
truth
the
glare
of
the
burning
piles
was
reappearing
in
france
a
pious
husbandman
of
bresse
exercised
in
the
word
of
god
by
name
john
cornon
was
arrested
in
his
native
village
in
the
month
of
may
and
taken
to
macon
when
brought
before
his
judges
he
spoke
with
such
faith
and
courage
that
they
were
astonished
and
confounded
accordingly
at
the
end
of
june
he
was
bound
to
a
hurdle
dragged
to
the
place
of
execution
and
there
burnt
alive
shortly
after
this
one
dennis
brion
a
man
zealous
for
the
gospel
was
put
to
death
during
great
days
of
angers
in
order
to
terrify
the
crowds
who
flocked
thither
from
all
parts
for
these
festivals
the
flames
which
burnt
these
pious
confessors
might
perhaps
shortly
burn
other
men
of
god
whom
calvin
desired
to
save
at
any
cost
he
therefore
determined
to
write
to
the
king
dedicating
his
book
to
him
a
bold
step
sidenote
letter
to
the
king
he
said
are
yourself
a
witness
by
what
false
calumnies
our
doctrine
is
everywhere
defamed
have
you
not
been
told
that
it
tends
to
nothing
else
but
to
ruin
all
kingdoms
and
governments
to
disturb
the
peace
to
abolish
all
law
to
confiscate
lordships
and
possessions
and
in
a
word
to
throw
everything
into
confusion
and
nevertheless
you
hear
only
the
least
part
of
these
outrages
horrible
stories
are
circulated
against
us
for
which
if
they
were
true
we
should
richly
deserve
to
be
hanged
a
thousand
times
over
what
calvin
undertook
to
do
was
not
merely
to
show
that
the
evangelical
doctrine
of
the
reformation
has
the
right
to
exist
side
by
side
with
the
roman
catholic
doctrine
this
philosophical
and
christian
was
not
that
of
the
sixteenth
century
if
the
evangelical
doctrine
has
a
right
to
exist
it
is
said
calvin
boldly
because
it
is
the
truth
he
desired
to
gain
over
both
king
and
people
to
those
convictions
which
in
his
opinion
were
alone
capable
of
enlightening
and
of
saving
them
defence
he
said
not
consist
in
disavowing
our
doctrine
but
in
maintaining
it
to
be
true
truth
deprives
her
adversaries
of
the
right
to
open
their
mouths
against
her
and
for
this
reason
sire
i
pray
you
to
obtain
full
information
of
a
cause
which
hitherto
has
been
treated
with
impetuous
fury
rather
than
with
judicial
gravity
do
not
think
that
i
am
striving
here
in
my
own
private
defence
in
order
to
return
to
my
native
country
verily
i
bear
it
such
human
affection
as
is
right
but
things
are
now
so
arranged
that
i
am
not
greatly
distressed
at
being
kept
out
of
it
no
sire
i
undertake
the
common
cause
of
all
believers
and
even
that
of
christ
himself
a
cause
now
so
rent
and
trodden
down
in
your
kingdom
that
it
seems
desperate
no
doubt
christ
truth
is
not
lost
and
scattered
but
it
is
hidden
away
and
buried
as
if
deserving
of
all
ignominy
the
poor
church
is
driven
out
by
banishment
consumed
by
cruel
deaths
and
so
terrified
by
threats
and
terrors
that
she
dares
not
utter
a
word
and
yet
the
enemies
of
truth
are
not
satisfied
they
insist
with
their
accustomed
fury
on
beating
down
the
wall
which
they
have
already
shaken
and
in
completing
the
ruin
they
have
begun
here
calvin
asks
if
no
one
is
taking
up
the
defence
of
these
persecuted
christians
he
looks
alas
the
evangelicals
are
silent
the
queen
of
navarre
scarcely
raises
her
timid
voice
and
diplomatists
are
persuading
the
germans
that
the
evangelicals
of
france
are
fanatics
and
madmen
every
one
trembles
he
exclaims
comes
forward
to
oppose
this
fury
if
even
any
should
wish
to
appear
to
favour
the
truth
they
confine
themselves
to
saying
that
we
should
in
some
way
pardon
the
the
of
these
simple
folks
thus
they
treat
god
most
sure
truth
as
and
those
whom
our
lord
has
so
esteemed
as
to
impart
to
them
the
secrets
of
his
heavenly
wisdom
they
call
who
permit
themselves
to
be
easily
deceived
so
ashamed
are
they
of
the
gospel
who
then
shall
take
the
cause
of
truth
in
hand
is
your
business
sire
said
calvin
to
the
king
to
avert
either
your
ears
or
your
heart
from
so
just
a
defence
a
great
matter
is
at
stake
we
have
to
learn
how
god
glory
shall
be
maintained
on
earth
how
his
truth
shall
retain
its
honour
and
how
christ
kingdom
shall
remain
in
its
integrity
a
matter
truly
worthy
of
your
ears
worthy
of
your
government
and
of
your
royal
throne
the
idea
which
makes
a
true
king
is
that
the
king
knows
himself
to
be
a
true
minister
of
god
in
the
management
of
his
kingdom
a
reign
which
has
not
god
glory
for
its
aim
is
not
a
reign
but
a
mere
brigandage
calvin
had
hardly
spoken
thus
when
he
seemed
to
see
francis
refusing
to
turn
aside
from
his
brilliant
fêtes
to
lend
his
ears
to
the
meanest
of
his
subjects
the
king
listens
to
montmorency
to
tournon
he
hastens
to
meet
the
duchess
he
even
welcomes
artists
and
men
of
letters
but
these
miserable
religionists
never
said
calvin
not
turn
away
in
disdain
of
our
meanness
verily
we
confess
that
we
are
poor
despicable
folks
sinners
before
god
reviled
and
rejected
before
men
nay
if
you
like
it
we
are
the
scum
of
the
earth
or
anything
more
worthless
still
that
can
be
named
yes
we
have
nothing
left
in
which
we
can
glory
before
god
except
his
only
mercy
and
nothing
before
men
except
our
weakness
but
the
apologist
immediately
lifts
up
his
head
with
holy
pride
he
says
doctrine
must
remain
exalted
invincible
and
far
above
all
the
power
and
glory
of
the
world
for
it
is
not
ours
but
that
of
the
living
god
and
his
christ
whom
god
has
made
king
to
rule
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
the
rivers
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
whose
magnificence
the
prophets
have
foretold
saying
that
he
shall
overthrow
kingdoms
strong
as
iron
and
brass
and
shining
like
silver
and
gold
here
the
advocate
of
his
brethren
hears
an
objection
from
their
enemies
he
sees
them
clustering
round
francis
and
incessantly
repeating
to
him
that
even
while
putting
forward
the
word
of
god
are
only
its
he
continues
can
judge
for
yourself
by
reading
our
confession
the
to
what
an
extent
the
reproach
is
nothing
but
wicked
calumny
and
brazen
impudence
what
is
more
conformable
with
the
christian
faith
than
to
acknowledge
ourselves
stripped
of
all
virtue
to
be
clothed
with
god
empty
of
all
good
to
be
filled
with
him
the
slaves
of
sin
to
be
freed
by
him
blind
to
have
our
sight
restored
by
him
lame
that
he
may
make
us
walk
weak
to
be
supported
by
him
in
a
word
to
put
off
from
us
all
manner
of
glory
that
he
alone
may
be
glorified
ah
we
do
not
read
of
men
being
blamed
for
drinking
too
deeply
at
the
fountain
of
living
waters
on
the
contrary
the
prophet
bitterly
reproves
those
who
have
hewed
out
broken
cisterns
that
can
hold
no
water
calvin
even
a
hopeless
attempt
it
touch
the
heart
sire
all
parts
of
our
cause
we
are
persecuted
some
of
us
are
kept
in
prison
others
are
scourged
others
forced
to
do
penance
others
banished
others
escape
by
flight
we
are
in
tribulation
insulted
treated
cruelly
looked
upon
as
outlaws
and
accursed
and
for
what
because
we
place
our
hope
in
the
living
god
and
believe
that
life
everlasting
is
know
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
he
hath
calvin
knew
very
well
however
that
the
victory
would
not
be
easy
he
had
seen
the
priests
closely
in
the
capital
in
cities
of
second
rank
and
in
the
country
he
fancied
he
could
hear
the
cries
raised
by
the
curés
in
their
parishes
and
the
monks
in
their
convents
wishing
therefore
to
enlighten
the
king
he
did
so
in
a
rather
coarse
manner
after
the
fashion
of
the
times
he
asked
our
enemies
fight
so
stoutly
and
so
sternly
for
the
mass
purgatory
pilgrimages
and
such
rubbish
because
the
belly
is
their
god
and
the
kitchen
their
religion
because
although
some
treat
themselves
delicately
and
others
starve
upon
crusts
they
all
eat
out
of
the
same
pot
which
without
these
branches
to
warm
them
the
mass
purgatory
would
not
only
grow
cold
but
freeze
entirely
calvin
was
not
ignorant
however
that
the
really
dangerous
enemies
of
the
reformation
were
not
those
priests
and
friars
whom
erasmus
and
so
many
others
had
often
flagellated
to
the
great
delight
of
the
king
he
imagined
he
saw
haughty
nobles
fanatical
priests
and
doctors
entering
the
king
closet
and
pouring
their
perfidious
accusations
into
his
ear
hear
them
he
says
call
our
doctrine
verily
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
seeing
that
even
christ
and
his
gospel
are
quite
new
to
them
but
he
who
knows
that
this
preaching
of
paul
is
old
namely
that
died
for
our
sins
and
was
raised
again
for
our
finds
nothing
new
among
us
true
it
has
long
been
hidden
and
unknown
but
the
crime
must
be
laid
to
the
wickedness
of
man
and
now
that
by
god
goodness
it
is
restored
to
us
it
ought
at
least
to
be
received
into
its
ancient
authority
here
the
enemies
persist
they
claim
the
old
doctors
of
the
church
as
being
in
their
favour
this
was
the
strongest
argument
in
the
eyes
of
francis
who
affected
a
certain
respect
for
ancient
christian
literature
calvin
was
familiar
with
the
writings
of
the
doctors
he
had
studied
them
night
and
day
at
angoulême
paris
and
basle
fathers
have
been
mistaken
just
like
other
men
he
said
these
good
and
obedient
sons
the
romish
friars
adore
the
errors
of
the
fathers
and
put
out
of
sight
what
they
have
said
aright
as
if
they
had
no
other
care
but
to
pick
out
the
rubbish
from
among
the
gold
and
then
they
attack
us
with
loud
clamours
as
despisers
of
the
ancients
far
from
despising
them
we
could
prove
from
their
testimony
the
greater
part
of
what
we
are
now
saying
but
those
holy
persons
often
differ
from
each
other
and
sometimes
contradict
themselves
they
ought
not
to
tyrannise
over
us
it
is
christ
alone
whom
we
must
obey
wholly
and
without
exception
why
do
not
our
adversaries
take
the
apostles
for
their
fathers
since
it
is
their
landmarks
and
theirs
only
that
we
are
forbidden
to
remove
and
if
they
desire
the
landmarks
of
the
fathers
to
be
observed
why
do
they
whenever
it
suits
their
pleasure
overleap
them
so
audaciously
further
than
this
calvin
makes
use
of
these
doctors
he
does
not
fear
them
on
the
contrary
he
appeals
to
them
he
calls
them
all
up
to
make
them
defile
before
the
king
and
bear
testimony
against
the
doctrines
of
rome
was
a
father
epiphanius
who
said
that
it
was
a
horrible
abomination
to
see
an
image
of
christ
or
of
any
saint
in
a
christian
temple
was
a
father
pope
gelasius
who
said
that
the
substance
of
the
bread
and
wine
dwells
in
the
sacrament
of
the
holy
supper
as
the
human
nature
dwells
in
our
lord
jesus
christ
united
to
his
divine
essence
was
a
father
augustine
who
called
it
a
rash
theory
to
assert
any
doctrine
without
the
clear
testimony
of
scripture
was
a
father
paphnutius
who
maintained
that
the
ministers
of
the
church
ought
not
to
be
forbidden
to
marry
and
that
chastity
consisted
in
having
a
lawful
wife
was
a
father
augustine
who
contended
that
the
church
ought
not
to
be
preferred
to
christ
because
whilst
ecclesiastical
judges
being
men
may
be
mistaken
christ
always
judges
righteously
ah
if
i
wished
to
reckon
up
all
the
points
in
which
the
roman
doctors
reject
the
yoke
of
the
fathers
whose
obedient
children
they
call
themselves
months
and
years
would
pass
away
in
reading
the
long
roll
and
then
they
reprove
us
for
going
beyond
the
ancient
boundaries
calvin
did
not
forget
that
he
was
speaking
to
a
prince
struck
with
the
condition
of
the
world
at
this
important
moment
when
old
superstition
and
new
doubts
old
disorders
and
new
immoralities
ambitions
war
and
desolations
were
all
conflicting
together
he
called
loudly
for
a
remedy
and
being
convinced
that
the
reformation
alone
could
save
society
he
exclaimed
of
evil
are
deluging
the
land
new
plagues
are
ravaging
the
world
everything
is
falling
into
ruins
we
must
despair
of
human
affairs
or
put
them
to
rights
even
if
it
be
by
violent
remedies
and
yet
men
reject
the
remedy
ah
everlasting
truth
alone
ought
to
be
listened
to
in
god
kingdom
against
it
neither
proscription
nor
lapse
of
years
nor
ancient
customs
nor
any
compact
whatever
avails
anything
the
church
say
his
adversaries
we
are
not
the
church
where
was
it
before
you
answered
calvin
often
has
not
the
church
suffered
eclipse
been
deformed
and
oppressed
by
wars
seditions
and
heresies
does
not
hilary
reprimand
those
who
blinded
by
an
unreasoning
respect
did
not
observe
what
sores
were
sometimes
hidden
under
a
fair
outside
you
seek
the
church
of
god
in
the
beauty
of
its
buildings
but
know
you
not
that
there
it
is
that
antichrist
will
set
up
his
throne
mountains
woods
and
lakes
prisons
wildernesses
and
are
to
me
safer
and
more
trustworthy
for
there
prophesied
the
prophets
who
had
withdrawn
to
them
god
seeing
that
men
were
unwilling
to
obey
the
truth
permitted
them
to
be
buried
in
deep
darkness
and
the
form
of
a
true
church
to
be
lost
while
still
preserving
those
who
belonged
to
it
hidden
and
scattered
here
and
there
if
you
are
willing
sire
to
give
up
a
part
of
your
leisure
and
to
read
my
writings
you
will
see
clearly
that
what
our
adversaries
call
a
church
is
a
cruel
gehenna
a
of
souls
a
torch
a
ruin
finally
the
young
doctor
knowing
that
the
cardinals
were
continually
repeating
to
francis
what
contentions
troubles
and
disturbances
the
preaching
of
this
doctrine
has
brought
with
it
gave
an
answer
to
that
vulgar
accusation
which
is
rather
striking
and
original
word
of
god
he
says
comes
forward
without
satan
rousing
himself
and
fighting
a
few
years
ago
when
everything
was
buried
in
darkness
this
lord
of
the
world
played
with
men
as
he
list
and
like
a
sardanapalus
took
his
pastime
in
peace
what
could
he
do
but
sport
and
jest
seeing
that
he
was
then
in
tranquil
possession
of
his
kingdom
but
since
the
light
shining
from
on
high
has
chased
away
the
darkness
the
prince
of
this
world
has
suddenly
thrown
off
his
lethargy
and
taken
up
arms
first
he
resorted
to
force
in
order
to
oppress
truth
then
to
stratagem
to
obscure
and
extinguish
it
oh
what
perversity
to
accuse
the
word
of
god
of
the
seditions
stirred
up
against
it
by
fools
and
madmen
sire
it
is
not
us
who
stir
up
troubles
it
is
those
who
resist
the
goodness
of
god
is
it
likely
that
we
whose
mouths
have
never
uttered
a
seditious
word
whose
lives
while
we
lived
under
your
sceptre
were
always
simple
and
peaceful
should
plot
the
overthrowing
of
kingdoms
now
even
that
we
are
expelled
we
cease
not
to
pray
to
god
for
the
prosperity
of
your
reign
there
be
any
who
under
colour
of
the
gospel
stir
up
tumults
if
there
be
any
who
wish
to
conceal
their
carnal
licence
by
asserting
the
liberty
and
grace
of
god
there
are
laws
and
punishments
ordained
to
purge
these
offences
but
let
not
god
gospel
be
blasphemed
by
the
of
the
wicked
calvin
thus
brings
his
letter
to
a
conclusion
he
said
have
set
before
you
the
iniquity
of
our
calumniators
i
have
desired
to
soften
your
heart
to
the
end
that
you
would
give
our
cause
a
hearing
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
regain
your
favour
if
you
should
be
pleased
to
read
without
anger
this
confession
which
is
our
defence
before
your
majesty
but
if
malevolent
persons
stop
your
ears
if
the
accused
have
not
an
opportunity
of
defending
themselves
if
impetuous
furies
unrestrained
by
your
order
still
exercise
their
cruelty
by
imprisonments
and
by
scourging
by
tortures
mutilation
and
the
stake
verily
as
sheep
given
up
to
slaughter
we
shall
be
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
yet
even
then
we
shall
possess
our
souls
in
patience
and
shall
wait
for
the
strong
hand
of
the
lord
doubtless
it
will
be
stretched
forth
in
due
season
it
will
appear
armed
to
deliver
the
poor
from
their
afflictions
and
to
punish
the
despisers
who
are
now
making
merry
so
boldly
the
lord
the
king
of
kings
establish
your
throne
in
righteousness
and
your
seat
in
equity
such
was
the
noble
and
touching
defence
which
a
young
man
of
addressed
to
the
king
of
france
he
heard
from
afar
the
mournful
cries
of
the
victims
and
his
soul
being
stirred
with
compassion
and
indignation
he
appeared
as
a
suppliant
before
the
voluptuous
prince
who
was
putting
them
to
death
after
finishing
an
address
of
such
rare
eloquence
calvin
wrote
the
august
and
then
hastened
to
get
the
manuscript
printed
sidenote
printing
of
the
institutes
there
was
a
house
at
basle
on
the
heights
of
pierre
known
by
the
sign
of
the
where
there
was
a
printing
office
belonging
to
thomas
plater
the
valaisan
calvin
often
went
there
plater
who
had
come
to
basle
with
myconius
as
we
have
seen
was
at
first
a
student
then
a
professor
and
finally
large
sums
gained
by
the
printers
had
given
him
the
desire
to
become
a
printer
also
when
calvin
was
looking
for
a
publisher
for
his
the
learned
grynæus
recommended
plater
to
him
the
latter
had
the
honour
of
printing
that
work
and
from
that
time
calvin
kept
up
an
occasional
intercourse
with
this
singular
man
when
some
years
later
felix
plater
the
son
of
thomas
who
was
going
to
study
medicine
at
montpelier
passed
through
geneva
calvin
to
whom
he
brought
a
letter
from
his
father
called
him
and
received
him
with
much
cordiality
heard
him
preach
on
sunday
morning
said
the
young
man
in
his
memoirs
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
people
it
was
as
we
have
said
in
august
that
calvin
handed
thomas
plater
his
epistle
to
francis
to
be
printed
he
had
written
it
in
french
and
the
french
edition
bears
the
date
of
the
of
august
but
he
immediately
translated
it
into
latin
and
printed
this
version
on
the
of
the
same
month
which
is
the
date
of
the
latin
edition
it
is
probable
that
the
epistle
to
francis
was
printed
in
both
languages
and
that
the
french
text
was
sent
to
the
king
and
the
latin
to
the
german
doctors
in
september
did
francis
ever
receive
the
letter
did
he
listen
to
this
admirable
apology
it
is
certain
that
his
heart
was
not
softened
it
is
even
possible
that
the
pleasures
and
policy
of
the
monarch
made
him
contemptuously
throw
aside
this
appeal
from
one
of
the
poorest
of
his
subjects
however
nothing
prevents
us
from
believing
that
the
king
did
read
it
for
the
style
alone
was
worthy
of
a
monarch
notice
friends
and
even
calvin
himself
hoped
much
from
it
the
king
would
but
read
that
excellent
letter
said
one
of
them
mortal
wound
or
we
are
greatly
mistaken
would
be
inflicted
on
that
harlot
of
babylon
but
was
an
ambitious
and
libertine
king
competent
to
understand
the
noble
thoughts
of
the
reformer
sidenote
calvin
starts

italy
calvin
having
published
his
appeal
to
francis
and
perhaps
ended
the
correction
of
the
proofs
of
the
thought
of
leaving
basle
these
publications
would
make
a
sensation
it
would
be
known
that
catherine
klein
lodger
was
their
author
and
calvin
would
find
himself
courted
and
sought

is
not
my
object
to
display
myself
and
to
acquire
fame
he
said
the
fear
of
becoming
famous
induced
him
therefore
to
get
out
of
the
way
he
had
however
other
reasons
for
quitting
basle

himself
drawn

italy

tells

the

a

of
exemplary
virtue
but
other
motives
impelled
the
young
reformer
he
desired
to
see
italy
as
his
friend
tells
us
this
desire
of
italy
so
common
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
rest
of
europe
from
the
time
when
the
roman
republic
subjected
the
nations
and
which
exists
still
in
our
days
calvin
felt
like
any
other
man
but
what
did
he
go
in
search
of
whilst
he
was
climbing
the
alps
and
contemplating
for
the
first
time
their
immense
glaciers
and
eternal
snows
what
thoughts
filled
his
mind
there
was
some
talk
then
of
a
council
had
that
event
which
seemed
near
at
hand
anything
to
do
with
his
journey
as
vergeria
had
gone
from
italy
to
germany
in
order
to
support
the
dominion
of
the
pope
did
calvin
wish
to
go
from
switzerland
to
italy
in
order
to
assail
it
or
attracted
by
the
almost
evangelical
reputation
of
contarini
sadolet
and
other
prelates
did
he
long
to
converse
with
them
did
he
feel
the
necessity
of
seeing
closely
that
papacy
with
which
he
was
to
deal
all
his
life
and
did
he
propose
to
study
like
luther
its
scandals
and
abuses
did
he
wish
to
carry
back
the
gospel
to
that
very
country
to
which
paul
had
taken
it
or
was
he
only
attracted
by
classical
recollections
by
the
learning
and
civilisation
of
that
illustrious
peninsula
there
was
a
little
of
all
these
inducements
probably
in
calvin
wish
he
desired
to
visit
the
land
of
heroes
martyrs
and
scholars
of
renée
of
ferrara
and
of
the
popes
but
his
chief
thought
we
can
not
doubt
was
to
teach
the
principles
of
the
reformation
to
proclaim
to
italy
that
christ
had
come
to
destroy
sin
and
had
opened
a
way
to
the
heavenly
father
for
all
who
seek
him
a
catholic
historian
says
that
the
young
reformer
conceived
the
design
of
withdrawing
from
their
obedience
to
the
pope
the
people
nearest
to
his
throne
there
is
some
exaggeration
in
this
statement
but
the
substance
is
true
calvin
crosses
the
torrents
ascends
the
sloping
valleys
of
the
alps
climbs
yonder
high
mountains
which
rise
like
impassable
walls
and
moves
courageously
towards
those
italian
lands
where
the
men
of
the
reformation
are
soon
to
be
drowned
in
their
blood
where
persecution
certainly
attends
him
and
perhaps
death
it
matters
not
onward
he
goes
we
might
say
after
an
historian
that
like
mithridates
he
desires
to
conquer
rome
in

let
us
leave
him
for
a
moment
and

those
countries

scripture
teach
us
that
opposition
is
often
a
means
of
developement
that
the
gifts
of
god
to
man
easily
perish
if
nothing
revives
them
that
contradiction
resistance
and
trial
thanks
to
the
care
of
divine
providence
tend
to
civilise
nations
and
preserve
to
christianity
the
truth
morality
and
life
it
has
received
from
on
high
whence
proceeds
this
moral
influence
of
contradiction
a
principle
never
evolves
all
that
it
contains
says
a
school
except
by
coming
in
collision
with
a
contrary
principle
in
effect
the
blow
which
a
soldier
receives
on
the
adds
to
his
valour
the
inflexible
obstinacy
of
rome
in
upholding
all
abuses
excited
luther
to
display
with
more
energy
the
great
principles
of
the
reformation
and
at
geneva
it
was
because
the
huguenots
had
to
contend
perpetually
against
a
mean
despotism
in
the
state
and
an
incorrigible
corruption
in
the
church
that
their
souls
groaned
after
liberty
and
a
better
religion
yet
contradiction
is
not
all
that
is
necessary
there
must
be
reconciliation
afterwards
the
twofold
opposition
of
the
huguenots
as
it
was
against
civil
and
religious
despotism
would
have
been
ruined
by
its
excess
and
would
have
ruined
geneva
if
it
had
not
been
moderated
afterwards
it
was
not
good
for
the
state
that
one
was
willing
to
obey
it
was
not
good
for
religion
that
opposition
to
popery
should
consist
in
walking
about
the
churches
during
mass
modern
times
needed
from
their
very
cradle
authority
in
the
bosom
of
a
free
people
and
pure
doctrine
in
the
bosom
of
a
living
church
god
gave
both
to
geneva
and
he
did
so
essentially
through
the
reformation
care
must
be
taken
however
that
we
go
not
too
far
in
the
way
of
accommodation
the
reformation
must
make
no
concessions
to
popery
whenever
it
has
gone
down
that
easy
incline
it
has
left
its
calm
heights
and
fallen
among
quagmires
which
have
endangered
its
purity
and
existence
but
that
was
the
conciliation
which
had
to
be
carried
out
in
those
times
and
which
ought
still
to
be
attempted
in
the
christendom
of
our
times
between
negative
protestantism
and
there
is
a
middle
path
on
the
one
hand
the
gospel
ought
to
supply
this
negative
protestantism
with
what
is
deficient
in
it
and
on
the
other
to
take
away
from
romanism
whatever
is
erroneous
in
it
the
huguenots
in
part
at
least
were
transformed
in
the
city
of
calvin
by
the
great
principles
of
the
reformation
it
was
by
the
potent
virtue
of
the
gospel
that
this
little
city
which
had
been
only
an
alpine
burgh
was
so
marvellously
metamorphosed
and
became
in
europe
the
capital
of
a
great
opinion
one
circumstance
however
tended
to
compromise
its
future
the
reform
triumphed
but
not
without
losing
strength
for
the
sword
struck
foul
in
the
struggle
a
man
strive
for
mastery
he
is
not
crowned
except
he
strive
lawfully
calvin
understood
better
than
the
other
reformers
the
spirituality
and
independence
of
the
church
and
yet
giving
way
to
the
general
weakness
he
had
recourse
to
the
secular
arm
to
maintain
discipline
and
was
unable
to
prevent
the
death
of
servetus
that
fatal
stake
did
more
injury
to
truth
than
to
falsehood
from
that
hour
the
doctrine
lost
its
power
a
stain
soiled
its
flag
and
error
seized
the
advantage
of
slipping
into
the
ranks
of
those
who
were
summoned
to
combat
her
eminent
minds
were
seen
abandoning
the
doctrines
of
the
reformation
chiefly
on
account
of
the
civil
intolerance
by
which
they
were
defended
and
thus
a
more
or
less
culpable
stagnation
followed
the
powerful
activity
and
glorious
battles
of
the
primitive
days
of
the
reformation
there
were
no
more
combats
round
the
expiatory
cross
the
eternal
word
the
fall
grace
and
regeneration
no
more
struggles
and
therefore
no
more
life
the
christian
fortress
that
calvin
had
erected
having
been
assailed
for
two
centuries
shaken
and
dismantled
was
on
the
point
of
being
razed
to
the
ground
when
fortunately
the
struggles
entirely
spiritual
struggles
began
again
and
religion
was
saved
by
them
when
god
after
ploughing
europe
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
with
the
terrible
share
of
a
conqueror
awoke
it
from
its
long
sleep
he
remembered
geneva
and
revived
there
as
in
other
places
doctrine
and
life
that
city
and
all
christendom
are
now
challenged
again
to
the
old
struggles
and
also
to
new
ones
in
which
faith
shall
triumph
over
absolute
thoroughgoing
negations
which
not
only
deprive
man
of
the
grace
and
adoption
of
the
children
of
god
but
deny
also
the
immateriality
and
immortality
of
the
soul
sidenote
vaud
and
geneva
we
shall
not
begin
with
the
struggles
of
the
reformation
in
geneva
but
with
those
which
were
fought
in
a
country
beautifully
situated
between
the
lakes
and
the
mountains
pays
de
vaud
the
country
was
not
large
its
cities
were
not
populous
and
the
names
of
the
men
who
struggled
there
do
not
occupy
an
important
place
in
the
annals
of
nations
let
us
not
forget
however
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
history
the
stage
of
one
is
a
brilliant
circle
of
the
other
a
humble
sphere
the
actors
in
the
former
are
great
personages
in
the
latter
men
of
low
esteem
in
their
own
day
but
is
not
the
least
sometimes
the
greatest
of
these
two
kinds
of
history
are
not
events
of
small
dimensions
geometrically
similar
to
great
ones
have
they
not
often
a
deeper
moral
significance
and
a
wider
practical
influence
with
truth
it
may
be
said
of
the
struggles
of
vaud
and
geneva
causam
in
parvum
locum
a
great
cause
is
here
confined
within
narrow
limits
the
scenes
so
modest
and
obscure
so
full
of
decision
and
life
which
this
history
presents
have
probably
done
more
to
found
the
kingdom
of
truth
and
liberty
than
the
disputes
and
wars
of
powerful
potentates
such
a
thought
as
this
has
been
expressed
even
in
paris
a
contemporary
writer
after
tracing
in
his
history
of
the
sixteenth
century
an
outline
of
the
portentous
future
threatened
by
the
intrigues
of
the
papacy
regains
his
courage
with
the
words
was
saved
by
all
the
reformers
have
been
men
of
strength
but
while
luther
and
calvin
have
particularly
contended
for
the
principles
and
doctrines
of
the
reformation
others
like
knox
and
farel
applying
themselves
to
the
practice
have
specially
undertaken
to
win
certain
countries
or
cities
to
the
gospel
the
men
of
god
in
all
ages
have
done
both
these
things
but
not
one
of
them
has
combined
the
two
like
paul
there
were
two
men
in
that
apostle
the
doctor
and
the
evangelist
calvin
was
the
great
doctor
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
farel
the
great
evangelist
the
latter
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
figures
in
the
reformation
sidenote
farel
a
catholic
in
his
youth
fanatic
in
abstinence
and
maceration
farel
had
embraced
salvation
through
grace
with
all
the
living
ardour
of
his
soul
and
from
that
hour
everything
appeared
to
him
under
a
new
face
his
desire
to
enlighten
his
contemporaries
was
intense
his
heart
intrepid
his
zeal
indefatigable
and
his
ambition
for
god
glory
without
bounds
a
difficulty
never
stopped
him
a
reverse
never
discouraged
him
a
sacrifice
even
were
it
that
of
his
life
never
alarmed
him
he
was
not
a
great
writer
in
his
works
we
meet
occasionally
with
disorder
and
prolixity
but
when
he
spoke
he
was
almost
without
an
equal
the
energetic
language
which
transported
his
hearers
had
been
derived
from
the
writings
of
the
prophets
and
apostles
his
doctrine
was
sound
his
proofs
strong
his
expressions
significative
poets
are
made
by
nature
orators
by
art
but
preachers
by
the
grace
of
god
and
farel
had
the
riches
of
nature
of
art
and
of
grace
he
never
stopped
to
discuss
idle
or
frivolous
questions
but
aimed
straight
at
the
conscience
and
exhibited
before
those
who
listened
to
him
the
treasures
of
wisdom
salvation
and
life
that
are
found
in
the
redeemer
full
of
love
for
truth
and
hatred
for
falsehood
he
inveighed
energetically
against
all
human
inventions
in
his
eyes
the
traditions
of
popery
were
a
gulf
in
which
horrible
darkness
reigned
and
hence
he
laboured
to
extricate
souls
from
it
and
plant
them
in
the
soil
of
god
word
his
manly
eloquence
his
lively
apostrophes
his
bold
remonstrances
his
noble
images
his
action
frank
expressive
and
sometimes
threatening
his
voice
that
was
often
like
thunder
as
beza
tells
us
and
his
fervent
prayers
carried
away
his
hearers
his
sermon
was
not
a
dissertation
but
an
action
quite
as
much
as
a
battle
is
every
time
he
went
into
the
pulpit
it
was
to
do
a
work
like
a
valiant
soldier
he
was
always
in
front
of
the
column
to
begin
the
attack
and
never
refused
battle
sometimes
the
boldness
of
his
speech
carried
by
storm
the
fortress
he
attacked
sometimes
he
captivated
souls
by
the
divine
grace
he
offered
them
he
preached
in
and
in
churches
he
announced
jesus
christ
in
the
homes
of
the
poor
and
in
the
councils
of
nations
his
life
was
a
series
of
battles
and
victories
every
time
he
went
forth
it
was
and
to
it
is
very
true
as
we
have
said
that
the
cities
where
he
preached
were
not
large
capitals
but
derbe
lystra
and
berea
where
paul
preached
were
little
towns
like
orbe
neuchâtel
and
geneva
most
assuredly
the
acts
of
the
reformation
are
not
the
acts
of
the
apostles
there
is
all
the
difference
between
them
which
exists
between
the
foundation
of
christianity
and
its
reformation
but
notwithstanding
the
inferiority
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
labours
of
the
reformers
have
a
claim
upon
the
interest
of
all
those
who
love
to
contemplate
the
humble
origin
of
the
new
destinies
of
mankind
is
there
after
the
establishment
of
christianity
anything
greater
than
its
reformation
have
not
those
weak
movements
which
began
in
the
petty
spheres
in
which
farel
and
calvin
lived
gone
on
widening
from
age
to
age
are
they
not
the
origin
of
that
new
religious
transformation
which
notwithstanding
the
declamations
and
the
triumphant
cries
of
unbelievers
is
now
going
on
in
every
nation
of
the
earth
the
source
of
the
rhone

but
a
thread
of
water
which
would
pass
unnoticed
elsewhere
but
the
traveller
who
stands
at
the
foot
of
the
huge
glaciers
which
separate
the
mountains
of
the
furka
and
the
grimsel
can
not
look
unmoved
at
that
little
stream
which
issuing
imperceptibly
from
the
earth
is
to
become
a
mighty
river

thought
of
what
it
is
to
be
inspires
the
friend
of
nature
and
of
history
in
this
sublime
solitude
with
emotions
more
profound
than
those
excited
by
its
copious
and
monotonous
waters
at

for
this
reason

admirably
prepared

his
successes
among

have
already
seen
what
he
did
at
aigle
neuchâtel
and
elsewhere

must
now
follow
him
into
other
parts
of
that
picturesque
country
enclosed
between

the
conquest
of

wounded
near
neuchâtel
by
a
riotous
crowd
he
had
been
placed
in
a
boat
and
carried
across
the
lake
to
morat
as
we
have
said
in
a
former
work
his
friends
in
that
town
had
welcomed
him
with
emotion
and
kept
watch
around
his
bed
condemned
to
repose
with
cold
spitting
blood
and
scarcely
able
to
speak
he
was
communing
in
silence
with
his
god
when
he
saw
a
young
dauphinese
of
good
appearance
christopher
fabri
by
name
enter
his
room
this
frenchman
of
whom
we
have
already
spoken
had
studied
medicine
at
montpelier
and
there
received
the
first
rays
of
the
gospel
having
started
for
paris
in
order
to
complete
his
studies
in
that
city
he
met
with
some
friends
of
the
truth
at
lyons
who
told
him
of
all
that
was
going
on
at
neuchâtel
and
its
vicinity
fabri
was
greatly
moved
and
being
a
man
of
lively
prompt
and
decided
character
he
suddenly
changed
his
route
calling
and
life
and
instead
of
going
on
to
paris
turned
his
steps
to
geneva
and
thence
to
morat
on
arriving
at
that
town
the
student
enquired
after
farel
and
on
presenting
himself
at
the
house
was
admitted
into
the
room
where
the
reformer
was
lying
modestly
approaching
the
bed
he
said
to
him
have
forsaken
everything
family
prospects
and
country
to
fight
at
your
side
master
william
here
i
am
do
with
me
what
seems
good
to
you
farel
looked
at
him
kindly
and
ere
long
appreciated
the
young
man
lively
affection
and
boundless
devotion
he
saw
that
they
both
had
the
same
faith
the
same
saviour
as
he
was
unmarried
he
looked
upon
fabri
as
a
son
whom
god
had
sent
him
and
henceforward
had
frequent
christian
conversations
with
him
in
which
he
sought
to
train
him
for
the
ministry
of
the
gospel
farel
would
have
liked
to
keep
him
always
at
his
side
but
he
loved
jesus
christ
more
than
the
tenderest
son
is
beloved
and
accordingly
after
a
short
but
delightful
intercourse
he
asked
the
converted
dauphinese
to
go
and
preach
the
gospel
at
neuchâtel
fabri
who
had
not
expected
so
early
a
separation
exclaimed
with
tears
master
my
sorrow
is
greater
than

so
sweet
have
been
my

obeyed
however
farel
was
never
content
with
sending
others
to

he
burned
to
return
to
it
in
person
and
to
lead

servant
he
was

population
which
enclosed

thought
that

were
won
over
to
the
divine
word
they
would
become

he
quitted
his
inn
and
went
to
the
where
he
found
the
offering
his
wares
with
much
shouting
the
monk
whose
eye
was
always
on
the
watch
soon
noticed
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
a
little
man
with
a
red
beard
and
piercing
eyes
who
caused
him
some
uneasiness
farel
approaching
slowly
took
his
place
quietly
before
the
stall
and
said
to
the
quack
just
as
an
ordinary
purchaser
would
have
done
but
with
concentrated
anger
you
indulgences
for
a
person
who
has
killed
his
father
and
mother
without
waiting
for
an
answer
and
wishing
to
undeceive
the
superstitious
crowd
he
boldly
stept
on
the
basin
of
the
public
fountain
and
began
to
preach
as
if
he
were
in
the
pulpit
the
astonished
left
the
monk
and
gathered
round
the
new
orator
whose
sonorous
voice
entreated
the
multitude
to
ask
pardon
of
the
saviour
instead
of
buying
indulgences
from
the
monk
as
the
priests
and
the
devout
were
exceedingly
irritated
at
both
preaching
and
preacher
farel
could
not
remain
at
orbe
but
a
few
drops
of
living
water
had
gushed
forth
and
some
souls
had
had
their
thirst
quenched
by
them
a
tradesman
christopher
hollard
by
name
and
one
mark
romain
a
schoolmaster
were
converted
to
the
gospel
at
this
time
the
whole
town
was
in
commotion
and
the
sisters
of
claire
as
bigoted
as
those
of
geneva
entreated
their
confessor
to
preach
against
heresy
such
a
request
had
great
weight
and
must
be
attended
to
for
these
sisters
were
held
in
great
consideration

of

knew
the
firmness
of

background
did
not
believe
that
the

with
which
the

flattered
himself
was
such
an
easy
thing
and
answered

far
from
your
opinion

more
obstinacy

is

for
that

was
not
to
be

by
this
opinion
and
he
gave
notice
of
his
sermons
against
the
reform
which
were
talked
about
all
over
the
city
the
bells
rang
priests
monks
and
devotees
filled
the
church
and
even
those
suspected
of
lutheranism
attended
the
orator
was
filled
with
joy
at
the
sight
of
the
unusual
crowd
and
his
head
was
turned
had
not
his
patron
saint
the
archangel
michael
armed
with
a
golden
spear
trampled
satan
under
his
feet
and
should
he
not
gain
a

victory
losing
all

he
began
to
extol
in
the
most
pompous
terms
rome
the
priesthood
and
celibacy
and
to
attack
the
reformers
with
violence
and
abuse
five
or
six
lutherans
were
noticed
in
the
church
pen
in

writing
down
all
the

said
on
a
piece
of
paper
which
they
held
on
their
knees

the
sermon
was
over
the
offended
bailiff
of
diesbach
the
grand
banneret
and
other
notables
displeased
with
the
presumptuous
discourse
accosted
the
friar
and
begged
him
to
desist
from
abusive
language
and
to
preach
simply
the
doctrines
of
the
church
but
in
the
eyes
of
certain
devout
folks
the
greater
michael
abuse
the
greater
his
eloquence
the
confessor
delighted
at
his
success
and
thinking
as
they
did
in
many
convents
that
knowledge
is
a
sign
of
the
children
of
the
devil
farel
had
studied
at
the
university
of

and
ignorance

of

went
into
the

again
on

took

exclaimed
poor
in
spirit
here
referred
to
are
the
priests
and
friars
they
have
not
much
learning
i
confess
but
they
have
what
is
better
they
are
mediators
between
man
and
god
worshippers
of
the
virgin
mary
who
is
the
of
all
graces
and
friends
of
the
saints
who
cure
all
diseases
what
then
can
those
want
who
listen
to
them
but
who
are
the
people
who
say
they
are
justified
by
faith
who
are
they
who
throw
down
the
crosses
on
our
roads
and
in
our
chapels
enemies
of
christ
what
are
those
priests
monks
and
nuns
who
renounce
their
vows
in
order
to
marry
impure
infamous
abominable
apostates
before
men
and
before
god
the
friar
was
continuing
in
this
strain
when
suddenly
a
loud
noise
was
heard
in
the
church
the
evangelicals
present
had
been
excited
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
discourse
at
first
they
had
restrained
themselves
and
then
whispered
to
each
other
but
when
the
monk
began
to
insult
those
who
thought
as
the
bible
says
that
is
honourable
to
all
one
of
them
unable
to
contain
himself
stood
up
and
before
the
whole
assembly
repeated
twice
and
with
sonorous
voice
the
words
lie
the
orator
stopped
in
amazement
and
everybody
turned
towards
the
quarter
whence
these
words
proceeded
they
saw
a
man
of
middle
age
standing
there
greatly
agitated
it
was
christopher
hollard
who
had
been
converted
by
farel
first
sermon
and
who
combined
an
honest
heart
with
a
violent
character
his
brother
john
hollard
the
late
dean
of
friburg
had
embraced
the
reformation
and
married
christopher
fancying
the
monk
was
reflecting
on
his
brother
had
hastened
to
protest
rather
coarsely
it
must
be
acknowledged
but
with
the
frankness
of
an
honest
heart
which
sees
the
commandment
of
god
blasphemed
sidenote
hollard
imprisoned
this
exclamation
had
hardly
resounded
through
the
church
when
a
great
uproar
caused
by
the
people
drowned
the
lutheran
voice
the
men
who
were
present
would
have
rushed
from
their
places
upon
the
disturber
but
the
women
who
filled
the
nave
were
before
them
with
one
accord
fell
upon
the
said
christopher
tore
out
his
beard
and
beat
him
they
scratched
his
face
with
their
nails
and
otherwise
so
that
if
they
had
been
let
alone
he
would
never
have
gone
out
of
the
said
church
which
would
have
been
a
great
benefit
for
poor
catholics
thus
spoke
the
grand
banneret
who
had
lost
as
it
would
seem
a
little
of
the
moderation
he
had
shown
on
other
occasions
the
castellan
anthony
agasse
was
not
of
his
opinion
he
wanted
the
culprits
if
there
were
any
to
be
punished
by
the
law
and
not
by
the
populace
and
rushing
into
the
midst
of
this
savage
scene
he
rescued
hollard
from
the
hands
of
the
furies
and
threw
him
a
dungeon
to
avoid
a
greater
scandal

sitting
down
in

near
the

he
sent
his
officers
to
fetch
friar

the
sergeants
carefully
searched
the
convent
and
several
houses
without
finding

house

named
pugin

informed

took
courage
left
the

and
went
straight
to
the
bailiff
who
was
still
seated
in

of
the
castle
waiting
the
result
of
his
enquiries
friar

saluted
him
respectfully
but
the
lord

up
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
said

a

going
quietly

meanwhile
the
people
alarmed
at
the
arrival
of
the
bailiff
and
the
imprisonment
of
the

assembled
in

and

said
and
began
to
cry
come

observing
the
tumult
passed
suddenly
from
joy
to
fear
and
took
to
flight
all
following
in
pursuit
they
gained
upon
him
he
looked
from
side
to
side
to
see
if
some
door
would
not
open
to
receive
him
but
all
remained
closed
arriving
in
front
of
the
church
he
rushed
into
it
but
had
hardly
set
his
feet
inside
when
he
stopped
in
astonishment
the
women
who
had
desired
to
tear
hollard
to
pieces
were
in
the
church
as
well
as
some
men
on
account
of
the
which
was
said
daily
at
five
in
the
afternoon
kneeling
before
the
altar
with
clasped
hands
and
eyes
turned
to
the
ground
they
were
invoking
the
of

of
mercy
we
send
up
our
groans
to
thee
o
thou
who
art
our
advocate
save
us
at
the
moment
when
romain
entered
the
women
turned
their
heads
and
caught
sight
of
him
being
suddenly
changed
into
furies
they
rushed
upon
him
as
they
had
done
before
upon
hollard
him
by
the
hair
threw
him
on
the
ground
and
beat
him
the
women
were
the
champions
of
catholicism
in
orbe
the
grand
banneret
looked
on
quietly
at
this
execution
saw
the
whole
affair
he
said
i
did
not
think
the
schoolmaster
would
ever
get
out
alive
pierrefleur
took
care
not
to
go
to
his
help
and
the
blows
continued
to
fall
on
poor
romain
until
one
of
his
friends
arrived
am
certain
says
the
banneret
who
had
seen
all
this
without
being
moved
had
it
not
been
for
the
assistance
he
received
from
this
lutheran
he
would
never
have
gone
out
of
the
place
until
he
was
dead
we
read
in
scripture
of
people
who
ceased
not
to
beat
paul
romain
who
experienced
riotous
and
cruel
rage
was
afterwards
a
minister
of
the
gospel
he
was
now
going
through
his
apprenticeship
a
mob
had
collected
round
the
castle
in
which
friar
michael
was
confined
and
angry
voices
were
heard
loudly
demanding
his
liberty
at
this
moment
the
bailiff
of
diesbach
came
out
to
return
to
his
place
of
residence
having
hollard
by
his
side
whom
he
was
going
to
restore
to
his
mother
when
he
saw
the
crowd
he
was
much
astonished
for
were
crying
out
and
demanding
their
good
father
have
you
arrested
friar
michael
asked
some
have
you
delivered
christopher
asked
others
order
of
my
lords
of
berne
answered
the
imperturbable
bailiff
and
then
added
pointing
to
the
lofty
walls
of
the
castle
you
can
set
him
at
liberty
you
may
take
him
but
i
advise
you
not
will
be
bail
for
our
good
father
body
for
body
goods
for
goods
exclaimed
the
burgesses
but
the
bailiff
kept
on
his
way
without
answering
them
the
sieur
of
diesbach
had
hardly
arrived
at
the
great
square
when
he
perceived
the
ladies
and
other
women
of
the
city
waiting
for
him
their
hearts
full
of
sorrow
and
anguish
they
all
fell
on
their
knees
many
tears
and
stretching
their
hands
towards
him
exclaimed
for
the
good
father
set
him
at
liberty
these
cries
softened
the
bernese
he
stopped
and
could
hardly
speak
for
emotion
he
made
them
understand
however
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
liberate
juliani
and
then
returned
home
for
hour
was
late
sidenote
farel
arrives
at
orbe
the
principal
catholics
now
assembled
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
a
priest
put
in
prison
in
orbe
for
a
strictly
romish
sermon
what
a
scandal
they
resolved
to
appeal
from
the
heretical
bernese
bailiff
to
the
friburgers
who
were
good
catholics
the
grand
banneret
volunteered
for
this
important
mission
and
next
day
noble
de
pierrefleur
and
francis
vuerney
set
out
for
friburg
where
they
related
everything
to
the
council
the
lords
and
princes
of
that
city
were
much
and
vexed
and
a
deputation
composed
of
bernese
and
friburgers
received
instructions
to
arrange
the
difference
but
this
measure
far
from
diminishing
the
struggle
was
destined
to
increase
it
as
the
deputation
passed
through
avenches
a
roman
city
older
than
the
cæsars
they
fell
in
with
farel
who
for
more
than
a
month
had
been
preaching
the
gospel
there
amid
its
ruined
aqueducts
and
amphitheatres
and
had
met
with
nothing
but
lukewarmness
without
hesitation
the
evangelist
left
avenches
and
departing
with
the
bernese
arrived
at
the
banks
of
the
orbe
whither
the
noise
of
battle
attracted
him
no
ruins
were
to
be
seen
there
but
seven
churches
and
altars
testified
to
the
ancient
splendour
and
romish
fervour
of
the
city
it
was
the
of
april
mass
had
been
celebrated
the
various
offices
had
been
said
even
to
vespers
farel
who
had
stayed
quietly
in
doors
observing
that
the
service
was
over
left
his
inn
presumptuous
boldness
his
friends
followed
him
idlers
flocked
round
him
the
devout
ran
after
and
a
crowd
of
men
women
and
children
soon
filled
the
church
with
a
great
noise
then
asking
leave
of
any
one
farel
went
into
the
pulpit
to
preach
but
he
had
scarcely
opened
his
mouth
when
everybody
women
and
children
hissed
howled
and
stamped
with
all
sorts
of
exclamations
to
disconcert
him
dog
they
cried
lubber
heretic
devil
and
other
insults
it
was
a
glorious
noise
really
could
not
have
heard
god
thunder
said
pierrefleur
farel
who
was
accustomed
to
tumult
as
a
soldier
to
the
whistling
of
the
bullets
continued
his
address
anger
got
the
better
of
some
of
them
that
he
would
not
desist
they
grew
riotous
surrounded
the
pulpit
pulled
him
out
of
it
and
would
even
have
proceeded
to
blows
the
confusion
was
at
its
height
when
the
bailiff
that
worse
would
follow
rushed
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
took
the
reformer
by
the
arm
and
escorted
him
to
his
lodging
the
mixed
commission
was
empowered
to
restore
peace
to
this
agitated
city
but
as
for
farel
he
had
but
one
idea
to
me
if
i
do
not
preach
the
if
he
can
not
preach
it
in
the
church
he
will
do
so
in
the
open
air
on
the
following
day
monday
he
left
the
house
of
his
entertainer
at
six
in
the
morning
and
proceeding
towards
the
great
square
began
to
preach
there
was
nobody
present
it
mattered
not
he
thought
that
his
powerful
voice
would
soon
collect
a
good
assembly
but
satisfied
with
the
victory
of
the
evening
before
the
inhabitants
of
orbe
had
said
to
themselves
that
they
would
leave
the
preacher
alone
he
had
not
a
single
hearer
that
was
not
however
the
only
reason
a
plot
was
concerting
against
women
plot
naturally
for
the
men
in
general
were
cold
in
comparison
with
the
other
sex
there
was
a
noble
dame
at
orbe
a
native
of
friburg
elizabeth
wife
of
hugonin
lord
of
arnex
an
honest
and
devout
woman
but
enthusiastic
violent
and
fanatical
elizabeth
being
persuaded
that
the
death
of
the
reformer
would
be
a
very
meritorious
work
had
assembled
at
her
house
some
other
bigoted
women
had
addressed
them
and
worked
upon
them
so
that
they
had
agreed
to
beat
the
reformer
and
even
kill
him
they
only
waited
for
an
opportunity
the
same
day
at
four
in
the
afternoon
a
city
council
was
held
at
which
the
deputies
of
berne
and
friburg
and
even
farel
also
were
present
when
the
council
was
over
the
reformer
came
out
it
was
the
moment
that
elizabeth
and
her
accomplices
informed
of
the
circumstance
had
selected
to
carry
out
their
plot
a
gentleman
pierre
de
glairesse
knowing
the
danger
the
evangelist
ran
quitted
the
council
after
him
and
begged
permission
to
accompany
him
meanwhile
the
women
who
had
left
their
houses
were
waiting
for
farel
in
the
middle
of
a
street
through
which
he
must
necessarily
pass
approaching
them
without
any
mistrust
they
fell
upon
him
unawares
took
him
by
the
cloak
says
the
chronicler
ironically
they
made
him
stagger
and
fall
they
then
attempted
to
him
and
beat
him
but
pierre
de
glairesse
rushing
in
between
them
took
him
out
of
their
hands
and
said
bowing
to
them
very
politely
pardon
ladies
at
present
he
is
under
my
charge
they
all
let
go
of
him
and
glairesse
conducted
him
to
the
inn
where
my
lords
of
berne
awaited
him
sidenote
friar
michael
examined
while
elizabeth
was
trying
to
kill
the
reformer
her
husband
william
of
arnex
as
bigoted
as
herself
was
pleading
the
cause
of
the
monk
the
mediators
had
ordered
that
friar
michael
should
be
put
on
his
trial
he
was
taken
to
the
castle
in
agitation
and
alarm
and
the
lords
of
berne
bringing
a
criminal
charge
against
him
said
asserted
that
the
poor
in
spirit
are
the
monks
deny
it
said
that
to
resist
the
pope
the
bishops
and
other
ecclesiastics
is
resisting
the
commandment
of
god

saying
it
in
those
terms
said
that
few
follow
the
new
law
except
a
heap
of
lascivious
monks

said
it
in
that
way
and
i

did
said
that
those
who
deny
that
the
books
of
the
maccabees
form
part
of
holy
scripture
are
heretics
did
said
that
those
who
have
adopted
the
new
law
have
no
good
in
them
and
deny
the
articles
of
faith
did
not
this
mixture
of
denials
and
confessions
disarmed
the
judges
they
listened
to
the
solicitations
of
and
set
juliani
at
liberty
the
bernese
however
bound
him
to
preach
in
future
nothing
but
the
word
of
god
honoured
lords
exclaimed
the
poor
friar
have
never
preached
anything
that
is
not
found
in
the
holy
gospel
in
the
epistles
of
paul
or
in
some
other
part
of
holy
scripture
friar
michael
confounded
at
not
gaining
a
triumph
as
striking
as
that
of
his
patron
with
the
brilliant
helmet
and
fearing
lest
he
should
be
sent
back
to
prison
thought
only
of
saving
himself
he
entered
the
convent
for
a
short
time
and
then
fled
into
burgundy
the
deputies
returned
home
and
farel
remained
shortly
after
easter
there
came
a
mandate
from
berne
ordering
that
whenever
farel
desired
to
preach
he
should
be
given
a
hearing
support
and
favour
as
soon
as
the
mandate
had
been
read
the
people
without
waiting
for
the
opinion
of
the
council
exclaimed
him
go
about
his
business
we
do
not
want
him
or
his
preaching
the
lords
of
berne
answered
that
farel
was
to
be
free
to
speak
but
that
no
inhabitant
was
constrained
to
hear
him
the
evangelist
gave
notice
that
he
would
preach
on
the
saturday
after
quasimodo
at
one
when
he
would
expose
juliani
errors
sidenote
farel
strange
congregation
the
catholics
not
content
with
the
permission
given
them
to
keep
away
determined
to
organise
a
reception
for
farel
that
should
disgust
him
for
ever
with
preaching
as
soon
as
the
minister
entered
the
church
the
strangest
of
congregations
met
his
eyes
all
the
brats
of
the
place
were
assembled
lying
in
front
of
the
pulpit
and
all
round
it
the
children
pretended
to
be
asleep
snoring
and
laughing
in
their
sleeves
farel
observing
three
persons
who
appeared
to
be
serious
went
into
the
pulpit
and
said
pointing
to
the
little
ragamuffins
many
weapons
satan
has
provided
to
hinder
our
cause
never
mind
we
must
surmount
every
obstacle
being
determined
to
refute
friar
michael
he
began
his
discourse
but
on
a
sudden
the
children
started
to
their
feet
as
lying
flat
behind
the
bushes
start
up
at
the
approach
of
the
enemy
and
salute
him
with
their
fire
the
young
scamps
exerted
their
lungs
howling
and
shouting
with
all
their
might
and
at
last
quitted
the
church
with
a
horrible
uproar
was
left
but
the
minister
quite
amazed
and
this
was
the
first
sermon
preached
in
the
town
of
orbe
says
the
grand
banneret
maliciously
the
next
day
sunday
there
was
a
great
procession
priests
monks
and
all
the
parish
chanting
as
loud
as
they
could
proceeded
according
to
custom
to
george
outside
the
town
farel
profited
by
the
departure
of
the
enemy
to
seize
upon
the
place
and
the
last
parishioner
had
hardly
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
church
when
he
entered
it
followed
by
his
friends
went
up
into
the
pulpit
and
loudly
declared
the
truth
ten
evangelicals
viret
hollard
secretan
romain
and
six
of
their
friends
composed
the
whole
of
his
congregation
meanwhile
the
procession
was
on
its
way
back
first
appeared
the
children
two
and
two
then
the
exorcist
with
the
holy
water
and
the
sprinkler
then
came
the
priests
magistrates
and
people
all
singing
the
litany
the
children
seeing
the
minister
in
the
pulpit
and
remembering
the
lesson
they
had
received
rushed
into
the
church
whistling
howling
and
shouting
as
on
the
evening
before
the
priests
and
people
who
followed
them
made
threatening
motions
and
farel
understanding
that
the
storm
was
about
to
burst
showed
a
moderation
he
did
not
always
possess
came
down
from
the
pulpit
and
went
out
the
clergy
exulted
they
ascribed
farel
retreat
to
weakness
and
fear
and
said
openly
in
the
city
minister
can
not
refute
the
articles
of
faith
established
by
juliani
answered
the
bernese
bailiff
have
heard
the
monk
and
you
now
complain
that
you
have
not
heard
the
minister
very
good
you
shall
hear
him
it
is
the
will
of
the
lords
of
berne
that
every
father
of
a
family
be
required
to
attend
his
sermon
under
pain
of
their
displeasure
sidenote
farel
on
penance
they
dared
not
disobey
and
the
church
was
thronged
filled
with
joy
at
the
sight
of
such
a
congregation
farel
ascended
the
pulpit
never
had
he
been
clearer
more
energetic
and
more
eloquent
he
passed
in
review
all
the
subjects
of
which
juliani
had
treated
at
one
time
attacking
the
pardons
which
the
romish
church
sells
to
credulous
souls
at
another
the
doctrine
which
assigns
the
keys
of
heaven
to
peter
key
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
he
said
the
word
of
holy
gospel
one
day
farel
spoke
of
the
stupid
practices
imposed
upon
catholics
under
the
name
of
penance
penance
which
god
demands
he
said
a
change
of
heart
life
and
conversation
another
day
he
battled
with
indulgences
pope
pardons
take
away
he
said
they
do
not
take
away
let
every
christian
be
aware
that
nobody
can
escape
the
anger
of
god
except
through
jesus
he
thundered
against
auricular
confession
in
the
priest
ears
which
the
pope
commands
he
said
him
to
learn
the
secrets
of
kings
and
aids
him
in
catching
countries
and
kingdoms
but
how
many
souls
have
been
cast
into
hell
by
it
how
many
virgins
corrupted
how
many
widows
devoured
how
many
orphans
ruined
how
many
princes
poisoned
how
many
countries
wasted
how
many
large
establishments
of
men
and
women
given
up
to
debauchery
o
heaven
unveil
these
accursed
horrors
o
earth
cry
out
creatures
of
god
weep
and
do
thou
o
lord
arise
farel
without
possessing
the
iconoclastic
ardour
which
hollard
displayed
ere
long
was
indignant
at
the
worship
paid
to
the
images
of
the
saints
and
strove
against
them
with
the
arms
of
the
word
people
he
said
candles
before
the
saints
who
are
out
of
this
world
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
while
if
those
saints
were
alive
and
had
need
of
a
light
to
read
the
gospel
by
instead
of
giving
them
candles
you
would
tear
out
their
eyes
then
scandalised
at
the
disorderly
living
of
the
world
and
the
church
the
christian
orator
exclaimed
full
of
scoffing
filth
and
ribaldry
obscene
and
idle
songs
books
full
of
vanity
lewdness
falsehood
and
blasphemy
wicked
and
illicit
conversations
all
this
is
suffered
openly
but
the
new
testament
which
contains
the
doctrine
and
passion
of
christ
is
forbidden
as
if
it
were
the
koran
of
mahomet
or
a
book
of
witchcraft
and
enchantment
o
sun
canst
thou
pour
thy
light
on
such
countries
o
earth
canst
thou
give
thy
fruits
to
such
people
and
thou
o
lord
god
is
thy
vengeance
so
slow
against
such
a
great
outrage
arise
o
lord
and
let
the
trumpet
of
thy
holy
gospel
be
heard
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
although
the
catholics
were
indignant
and
not
without
reason
at
the
order
from
berne
which
obliged
them
to
attend
the
sermons
opposed
to
their
faith
the
reformer
preached
without
difficulty
the
first
and
second
day
but
on
the
third
the
alarmed
priests
harangued
their
flocks
and
thundered
from
their
pulpits
against
the
heretical
discourses
and
from
that
time
farel
counted
few
hearers
in
the
church
besides
the
friends
of
the
gospel
the
bailiff
had
the
good
sense
not
to
observe
this
disobedience
sidenote
farel
care
for
the
ministry
the
surrounding
districts
compensated
farel
for
the
contempt
of
orbe
his
reputation
having
spread
into
the
neighbouring
villages
the
people
eagerly
desired
to
hear
him
receiving
message
after
message
and
touched
at
the
sight
of
these
worthy
peasants
knocking
at
his
door
he
wrote
to
zwingle
how
great
is
the
harvest
no
one
can
describe
the
ardour
the
people
feel
for
the
gospel
and
the
tears
i
shed
when
i
see
the
small
number
of
reapers
several
of
the
evangelicals
of
orbe
asked
to
be
sent
out
to
preach
but
farel
thinking
them
not
ripe
enough
refused
there
were
some
who
took
offence
at
this
but
it
did
not
move
farel
is
better
to
offend
them
he
said
to
offend
god
saint
paul
said
hands
suddenly
on
no
farel
and
the
other
reformers
desired
that
the
minister
should
honour
his
ministry
he
required
above
all
things
a
converted
heart
but
that
was
not
enough
it
is
a
bad
sign
when
the
church
admits
into
the
number
of
those
who
are
to
point
out
the
gate
of
salvation
either
men
who
have
not
passed
through
it
or
who
have
not
the
gift
of
the
word
or
are
deficient
in
wisdom
but
if
the
leaders
of
the
church
are
faithful
god
will
send
them
true
ministers

chapter
iii
a
new
reformer
and
an
in
william
viret
a
burgess
of
orbe
and
tailor
had
a
son
born
to
him
whom
he
named
peter
the
boy
had
grown
up
in
the
midst
of
the
and
had
watched
his
father
workmen
as
they
pressed
or
glossed
or
fulled
the
cloths
as
they
came
from
the
hands
of
the
weavers
but
he
took
no
delight
in
this
for
he
was
not
born
a
tradesman
it
was
the
inner
man
that
was
to
be
developed
in
him
he
felt
within
himself
a
necessity
for
seeking
god
which
impelled
him
towards
heaven
he
sought
the
society
of
the
burgesses
and
even
had
some
relations
with
the
nobles
but
the
first
object
of
his
wishes
was
god
if
he
took
a
walk
alone
or
with
one
of
his
brothers
anthony
and
john
along
the
picturesque
banks
of
the
orbe
through
the
charming
country
bathed
by
its
waters
and
even
to
the
foot
of
the
jura
he
looked
around
him
with
delight
but
afterwards
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
was
naturally
given
to
religion
he
said
which
however
i
was
then
ignorant
i
was
preparing
myself
for
heaven
seeing
that
it
was
the
way
of
salvation
he
resolved
to
devote
himself
to
the
service
of
the
altar
which
his
father
did
not
oppose
townspeople
and
peasantry
alike
regarding
it
as
an
honour
to
count
a
priest
among
their
children
peter
who
had
a
good
understanding
and
memory
soon
learnt
all
that
was
taught
in
the
school
at
orbe
and
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
university
of
paris
that
great
light
which
twelve
years
before
had
attracted
farel
footsteps
his
father
whose
trade
had
placed
him
in
easy
circumstances
consented
to
send
him
to
paris
whither
the
boy
proceeded
in
being
then
a
little
over
twelve
years
of
age
the
same
year
and
about
the
same
time
john
calvin
of
noyon
who
was
two
years
older
than
viret
arrived
in
the
same
city
and
entered
the
college
of
la
marche
did
these
two
boys
who
were
one
day
to
be
so
closely
united
meet
then
and
did
their
friendship
begin
with
their
childhood
we
have
not
been
able
to
satisfy
ourselves
on
the
point
sidenote
viret
goes
to
paris
viret
distinguished
himself
at
college
by
his
love
of
study
made
good
progress
in
learning
and
also
by
his
devotion
to
the
practices
of
the
roman
church
can
not
deny
he
said
i
went
pretty
deep
into
that
babylon
in
one
of
the
last
visits
he
made
to
paris
farel
seems
to
have
remarked
viret
whose
charming
modesty
easily
won
the
heart
and
to
have
helped
in
freeing
the
young
swiss
from
the
darkness
in
which
he
still
lay
the
gospel
penetrated
the
soul
of
the
youthful
scholar
of
orbe
almost
at
the
same
time
as
it
enlightened
the
large
understanding
of
the
scholar
of
noyon
the
mildness
of
his
character
softened
the
struggles
which
had
been
so
fierce
in
farel
and
calvin
and
yet
he
too
had
to
tread
the
path
of
anguish
to
arrive
at
peace
perceiving
a
frightful
abyss
and
an
eternal
night
beneath
his
feet
he
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
deliverer
who
was
calling
him
still
at
college
he
said
took
me
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
error
before
i
had
sunk
deeper
into
that
babylon
of
antichrist
the
time
having
arrived
when
he
should
receive
the
tonsure
he
felt
that
he
must
make
up
his
mind
the
struggle
was
not
a
long
one
he
refused
and
was
immediately
down
as
belonging
to
the
lutheran
religion
foreseeing
what
awaited
him
he
hastily
quitted
paris
and
france
and
to
his
father
house
in
after
years
he
exclaimed
thank
god
that
the
mark
and
sign
of
the
beast
were
not
set
upon
my
forehead
sidenote
viret
struggles
viret
found
orbe
greatly
changed
the
contest
then
going
on
between
the
gospel
and
popery
intimidated
him
at
first
his
was
one
of
those
reflective
souls
which
absorbed
by
the
struggles
within
naturally
shrink
from
those
without
like
other
reformers
he
had
a
difficulty
in
quitting
the
body
of
catholicity
but
a
severe
conscience
obliged
him
to
seek
truth
at
any
sacrifice
sometimes
the
church
of
rome
with
all
its
errors
and
abuses
alone
struck
his
imagination
and
he
would
exclaim
with
emotion
is
the
stronghold
of
superstition
the
fortress
of
satan
then
all
of
a
sudden
and
before
he
had
time
to
defend
himself
the
old
system
of
catholicism
resumed
its
power
over
him
and
he
found
himself
in
anguish
and
darkness
he
struggled
and
prayed
the
truth
for
a
moment
hidden
reappeared
before
his
eyes
and
he
said
asserts
that
antiquity
is
truth
but
what
is
there
older
in
the
world
than
lies
rebellion
murder
extortion
impurity
idolatry
and
all
kinds
of
wickedness
and
abomination
to
follow
the
doctrine
of
cain
and
of
sodom
is
verily
to
follow
an
old
doctrine
but
virtue
truth
holiness
innocence
and
thou
o
god
which
art
the
father
of
them
all
are
older
still
the
priests
of
orbe
who
were
strongly
attached
to
the
romish
doctrine
seeing
the
son
often
solitary
and
full
of
care
began
to
grow
uneasy
about
him
they
accosted
him
and
spoke
of
the
old
doctors
of
the
testimony
of
the
saints
of
augustin
cyprian
chrysostom
and
jerome
these
testimonies
had
much
weight
in
viret
mind
his
head
was
bewildered
his
feet
slipped
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
falling
back
into
the
gulf
when
snatching
again
at
the
word
of
god
he
clung
to
it
saying
i
will
not
believe
because
of
tertullian
or
cyprian
or
origen
or
chrysostom
or
peter
lombard
or
thomas
aquinas
not
even
because
of
erasmus
or
luther
if
i
did
so
i
should
be
the
disciple
of
men
i
will
believe
only
jesus
christ
my
shepherd
at
length
the
divine
word
delivered
viret
from
the
theocratic
dominion
of
rome
and
he
then
began
to
look
around
him
alas
what
did
he
see
chains
everywhere
prisoners
held
fast
the
citadel
of
idolatry
he
felt
the
tenderest
affection
for
the
captives
the
lord
has
brought
me
he
said
can
not
forget
those
who
are
two
of
these
prisoners
were
never
out
of
his
thoughts
they
were
his
father
and
mother
at
one
time
absorbed
by
the
cares
of
business
at
another
mechanically
attending
divine
service
they
did
not
seek
after
the
one
thing
needful
the
pious
son
began
to
pray
earnestly
for
his
parents
to
show
them
increased
respect
to
read
them
a
few
passages
of
holy
scripture
and
to
speak
gently
to
them
of
the
saviour
they
felt
attracted
by
his
conduct
and
the
faith
he
professed
took
hold
of
their
hearts
the
grateful
viret
was
able
to
say
have
much
occasion
to
give
thanks
to
god
in
that
it
hath
pleased
him
to
make
use
of
me
to
bring
my
father
and
mother
to
the
knowledge
of
the
son
of
god
ah
if
he
had
made
my
ministry
of
no
other
use
i
should
have
had
good
cause
to
bless
him
as
soon
as
viret
met
farel
again
at
orbe
he
immediately
became
one
of
the
evangelist
hearers
and
ere
long
took
his
father
along
with
him
the
most
intimate
union
sprung
up
between
these
men
of
god
one
completed
the
other
if
farel
was
ardent
intrepid
and
almost
rash
viret
a
wondrously
meek
temper
there
was
in
him
a
grace
that
won
the
heart
and
a
christian
sensibility
that
was
really
touching
and
yet
like
farel
and
calvin
he
was
firm
in
doctrine
and
morals
farel
always
eager
to
send
workmen
into
the
harvest
persuaded
his
friend
to
preach
not
only
in
the
country
but
in
orbe
itself
the
young
and
timid
viret
recoiled
from
the
task
farel
proposed
to
him
but
the
reformer
pressed
him
as
others
had
pressed
luther
and
calvin
he
believed
that
viret
who
belonged
to
the
city
and
was
loved
by
everybody
would
receive
a
favourable
welcome
the
thought
of
the
divine
grace
the
strength
of
which
he
knew
decided
viret
it
not
be
my
mouth
which
persuades
he
said
the
mouth
of
jesus
christ
for
it
is
jesus
christ
who
pierces
the
heart
with
the
fiery
arrow
of
his
spirit
sidenote
viret
preaches
at
orbe
on
the
may
an
unusual
crowd
not
only
of
townspeople
but
of
persons
from
the
neighbourhood
filled
the
church
of
orbe
the
son
of
one
of
the
most
respected
of
the
burgesses
a
child
of
the
place
was
to
enter
the
pulpit
he
was
accused
of
being
rather
heretical
but
he
was
so
inoffensive
that
nobody
would
believe
it
and
besides
many
of
the
young
folks
of
orbe
who
had
sported
with
him
on
the
banks
of
the
river
wished
to
see
their
old
playfellow
in
the
pulpit
the
congregation
who
were
waiting
impatiently
saw
the
young
man
appear
at
last
he
was
of
small
stature
and
pale
complexion
his
face
thin
and
long
his
eyes
lively
and
the
whole
expression
meek
and
winning
he
was
only
twenty
years
old
but
appeared
to
be
younger
still
he
preached
his
sermon
was
accompanied
by
so
much
unction
and
learning
his
language
was
so
persuasive
his
eloquence
so
searching
and
penetrating
that
even
the
most
worldly
men
were
attracted
by
his
discourse
and
hung
as
it
were
upon
his
lips
the
proverb
man
is
a
prophet
in
his
own
was
not
exemplified
in
viret
case
the
of
may
was
a
great
day
for
him
all
his
life
through
he
preserved
the
recollection
of
his
first
sermons
thirty
years
later
he
said
to
the
nobles
and
burgesses
of
orbe
church
was
the
first
in
which
god
was
pleased
to
make
use
of
my
ministry
when
it
was
still
in
its
youth
and
i
was
very
young
from
that
day
viret
took
his
place
in
that
noble
army
of
heralds
of
the
word
which
the
lord
was
raising
among
the
nations
his
part
in
it
was
modest
but
well
marked
the
college
of
reformers
as
well
as
the
college
of
the
apostles
contained
the
most
different
characters
as
the
sap
is
everywhere
the
same
in
nature
the
spirit
of
god
is
everywhere
the
same
in
the
church
but
everywhere
alike
each
of
them
produces
different
flowers
and
different
fruits
the
ardent
farel
was
the
peter
of
the
swiss
reform
the
mighty
calvin
the
paul
and
the
gentle
viret
the
john
sidenote
conversion
of
elizabeth
farel
viret
romain
hollard
and
the
other
evangelicals
waited
for
the
effects
of
the
preaching
at
orbe
they
saw
clearly
slight
touches
and
pricks
but
few
persons
had
been
wounded
and
pierced
to
the
quick
and
so
overwhelmed
with
the
feeling
of
everlasting
death
that
they
thought
of
looking
for
help
solely
to
the
grace
of
jesus
christ
all
of
a
sudden
and
a
month
only
after
farel
arrival
the
report
of
an
unexpected
conversion
filled
orbe
with
astonishment
and
became
the
subject
of
general
conversation
it
was
he
who
repeated
it
could
hardly
believe
madame
elizabeth
the
wife
of
the
lord
of
arnex
the
very
same
who
had
planned
the
women
conspiracy
and
so
severely
beaten
farel
was
entirely
changed
that
even
her
husband
who
had
become
bail
for
juliani
and
had
set
him
at
liberty
had
changed
likewise
the
bigots
of
both
sexes
could
not
deny
the
fact
they
said
has
become
one
of
the
worst
lutherans
in
the
city
not
long
after
they
made
a
great
noise
because
at
all
saints
or
some
feast
of
our
lady
elizabeth
had
a
large
wash
or
other
manual
labours
at
her
house
they
shook
their
heads
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
smiled
the
evangelicals
did
not
imitate
them
they
thought
to
borrow
the
language
of
one
of
their
leaders
that
though
these
people
smiled
it
was
a
forced
smile
for
they
felt
as
if
inwardly
choking
they
knew
that
god
word
is
a
hammer
and
that
there
is
nothing
so
hard
so
massive
or
so
hidden
in
the
heart
of
man
that
its
power
can
not
reach
had
not
paul
been
a
persecutor
like
elizabeth
and
hugonin
worse
still
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
the
catholics
happened
ere
long
one
of
the
ecclesiastics
of
the
place
was
george
grivay
surnamed
calley
an
excellent
musician
who
had
been
appointed
precentor
he
had
been
trained
by
a
fervent
catholic
mother
and
had
received
a
good
education
in
the
church
in
order
to
receive
further
instruction
his
parents
had
sent
him
to
lausanne
where
he
had
been
made
chorister
and
had
particularly
improved
in
the
knowledge
of
music
on
his
return
to
orbe
the
nobles
and
priests
had
given
him
a
flattering
reception
and
he
deserved
it
for
he
enchanted
the
people
by
his
singing
or
electrified
them
by
his
discourses
but
on
the
may
the
same
month
in
which
viret
delivered
his
first
sermon
grivat
had
gone
up
into
the
pulpit
and
astonished
his
hearers
by
preaching
the
evangelical
doctrine
in
the
clearest
manner
this
was
too
much
his
father
and
his
brothers
were
in
despair
nobles
and
friends
who
had
received
him
so
well
exclaimed
in
great
irritation
we
not
given
him
good
wages
has
not
the
church
fed
and
taught
him
and
now
he
wants
to
imitate
the
cuckoo
that
eats
the
mother
who
reared
it
sidenote
lord
supper
at
orbe
as
these
successive
conversions
gave
the
evangelicals
more
courage
they
took
an
important
step
feeling
the
necessity
of
being
strengthened
in
the
faith
by
the
celebration
of
the
lord
supper
they
asked
for
it
and
farel
who
was
then
at
morat
immediately
returned
to
orbe
on
whitsunday
may
at
six
in
the
hour
selected
to
insure
tranquillity
for
the
act
they
were
about
to
announced
to
a
numerous
assembly
collected
in
the
church
the
remission
of
all
sins
by
the
breaking
of
christ
body
on
the
cross
and
as
soon
as
the
sermon
was
ended
eight
disciples
came
forward
to
break
bread
they
were
hugonin
of
arnex
and
his
wife
hollard
and
his
aged
mother
cordey
and
his
wife
william
viret
peter
father
and
george
grivat
afterwards
pastor
at
avenches
many
of
the
evangelicals
did
not
think
themselves
sufficiently
advanced
in
the
faith
to
take
part
in
this
act
and
doubtless
peter
viret
was
absent
two
of
the
eight
disciples
modestly
spread
a
white
cloth
over
a
bench
on
which
they
placed
the
bread
and
wine
farel
sank
on
his
knees
and
prayed
all
following
his
prayer
in
their
hearts
when
the
minister
rose
up
he
asked
you
each
forgive
one
another
and
the
believers
answered
yes
next
farel
broke
off
a
morsel
of
bread
for
each
saying
he
gave
it
them
in
memory
of
christ
passion
and
after
that
he
handed
them
the
cup
the
minister
and
these
true
disciples
possessed
by
faith
the
real
presence
of
jesus
in
their
hearts
they
had
hardly
finished
when
the
exasperated
priests
entered
the
church
hastily
and
sang
the
mass
as
loud
as
they
could
the
next
day
whitmonday
there
was
a
fresh
scandal
the
evangelicals
were
at
work
said
many
indignantly
keep
no
holiday
the
if
the
evangelisation
had
continued
in
a
peaceful
course
of
christian
edification
the
city
would
in
all
probability
have
been
entirely
gained
over
but
the
reformation
had
its
terribles
calvin
said
in
vain
who
are
wise
according
to
god
are
modest
peaceable
and
gentle
they
do
not
conceal
vices
they
endeavour
rather
to
correct
them
but
provided
it
be
in
peace
that
is
to
say
with
so
much
moderation
that
unity
remains
unbroken
peaceable
and
loving
representations
ought
not
to
be
laid
aside
and
those
who
desire
to
be
physicians
must
not
be
executioners
a
fine
stone
crucifix
in
germain
cemetery
had
been
thrown
down
and
another
which
stood
at
a
cross
road
near
the
city
had
been
destroyed
but
this
had
been
done
at
night
and
it
was
not
known
by
whom
ere
long
the
ardent
reformers
grew
bolder
and
especially
christopher
hollard
a
true
iconoclast
of
the
reform
who
thought
more
of
pulling
down
than
of
building
up
one
day
as
farel
was
preaching
before
the
deputies
of
berne
and
friburg
hollard
flew
at
an
image
of
the
virgin
and
dashed
it
to
pieces
another
day
he
threw
down
the
great
altar
of
the
church
of
our
lady
this
was
not
enough
according
to
hollard
whose
mind
was
upright
and
even
pious
but
ardent
extreme
and
rather
deficient
in
judgment
the
reformation
that
is
to
say
the
destruction
of
images
and
altars
did
not
go
on
fast
enough
and
he
therefore
resolved
to
carry
it
out
on
a
grand
scale
he
took
twelve
companions
with
him
and
these
agents
of
the
judgments
of
god
as
they
thought
themselves
going
from
street
to
street
and
from
church
to
church
down
all
the
altars
in
the
seven
churches
of
the
city
heaps
of
rubbish
bore
witness
to
their
triumph
they
could
say
no
doubt
that
all
worship
paid
to
an
image
is
a
relic
of
paganism
but
their
fault
was
to
suppose
that
catholics
ought
to
adore
god
not
according
to
their
catholic
conscience
but
according
to
that
of
the
reformed
protestants
the
people
looked
at
each
other
with
alarm
but
said
nothing
was
greatly
astonished
says
de
pierrefleur
the
patience
of
the
populace
banneret
observed
some
catholics
we
did
not
feel
great
loyalty
towards
our
lords
of
berne
the
body
of
christopher
hollard
would
not
have
touched
earth
that
is
to
say
they
would
have
hanged
him
these
combatants
were
pretty
well
matched
for
gentleness
the
catholics
set
up
tables
in
the
place
of
the
altars
upon
which
they
celebrated
mass
meanly
sidenote
arrest
of
the
priests
the
intolerance
of
christopher
hollard

threatened
to
substitute
a

tyranny
for
the
ancient
tyranny
of

alas
the
protestant
clergy
have
sometimes
been
known
to
oppose
the
disciples
and
doctrines
of
the
gospel
just
as
the
romish
clergy
would
have
done
intolerance
is
a
vice
of
human
nature
which
even
piety
does
not
always
cure

little
tables

of

in

place
the
two
fiery
lutherans
laid
a
complaint
before
him
against
all
priests
as
being
murderers
of
souls
and
according
to
the
custom
of
the
age
surrendered
themselves
prisoners
the
governor
ordered
the
roman
ecclesiastics
to
be
arrested
which
was
no
easy
matter
for
there
were
some
sturdy
fellows
among
them
three
sergeants
having
attempted
to
seize
messire
pierre
bovey
in
the
street
the
stout
priest
them
into
the
passage
of
a
house
and
there
beat
them
so
that
they
were
glad
to
escape
out
of
his
hands
having
thus
defended
himself
like
a
lion
he
remained
free

it
was
not

with

the
curé
who
like
a
sheep
straight
to
prison
the
officers
put
him
along
with
the
rest
who
were
treated
at
bed
and
board
with
permission
to
go
all
over
the
castle
some
bold
priests
for
they
were
not
all
shut
up
chanted
mass
at
five
in
the
morning
notwithstanding
the
prohibition
the
catholics
attended
with
pikes
halberds
and
clubs
and
rang
the
bells
as
if
the
city
were
on
fire
before
long
the
intolerant
protestants
received
a
severe
and
well
merited
lesson
sidenote

of
the

the
grand
banneret
pierrefleur
who
was
a
man
of
the
world
well
read
of
a
cultivated
mind
charming
simplicity
and
profound
intelligence
combined
great
decision
of
character
with
vaudois
being
a
catholic
from
conviction
and
knowing
that
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
were
for
the
roman
faith
and
disgusted
at
seeing
the
priests
in
prison
and
the
faithful
compelled
to
hear
mass
almost
in
secret
he
summoned
a
general
council
of
the
people
you
he
asked
them
you
have
the
mass
and
live
and
die
in
the
holy
faith
like
your
forefathers
if
you
do
wish
it
let
every
one
hold
up
his
finger
and
if
perchance
there
should
be
any
one
of
a
contrary
opinion
let
him
leave
the
assembly
every
one
raised
his
finger
in
token
of
an
oath
whereupon
the
friburgers
sent
a
herald
to
orbe
the
priests
were
taken
out
of
prison
and
those
who
had
helped
to
pull
down
the
altars
were
put
in
their
place
there
were
fifteen
in
all
and
among
them
was
elizabeth
husband
the
noble
hugonin
of
arnex
they
were
not
so
well
treated
at
and
board
as
the
priests
had
been
but
were
put
on
bread
and
water
after
three
days
however
they
were
allowed
to
return
home
during
this
time
the
priests
and
fervent
catholics
were
restoring
the
altars
everywhere
it
required
more
than
twenty
years
for
the
reform
in
orbe
to
recover
from
the
blow
inflicted
on
it
by
the
intolerance
of
hollard
and
his
friends
it
was
not
until
that
an
assembly
of
the
people
decided
by
a
majority
of
eighteen
votes
in
favour
of
the
establishment
of
evangelical
worship
the
priests
nuns
and
friars
then
left
the

farel
zeal
was
not
cooled
by
the
check
he
had
received
at
orbe
he
saw
before
him
other
places
that
must
be
evangelised
if
he
withstood
the
ambitious
demands
of
the
new
converts
who
like
hollard
fancied
themselves
more
capable
than
they
really
were
and
indiscreetly
sought
for
consecration
to
the
holy
office
he
did
but
seek
with
more
zeal
for
servants
of
god
who
possessed
a
spirit
of
strength
charity
and
prudence
certain
men
appeared
to
him
to
have
been
ripened
in
france
by
persecution
he
invited
into
switzerland
toussaint
lecomte
symphoranus
andronicus
and
others
as
soon
as
these
brethren
arrived
he
sent
them
into
the
harvest
and
frequently
after
fervent
prayers
he
seemed
to
see
the
whole
valley
enclosed
between
the
jura
and
the
alps
filled
with
the
living
waters
of
the
gospel
a
truth
said
he
we
look
at
the
times
that
have
gone
before
the
work
of
christ
is
glorious
now
and
yet
what
roots
remain
to
be
torn
up
before
the
field
is
ready
to
receive
the
divine
seed
what
works
to
be
accomplished
what
toils
to
be
endured
what
enemies
to
be
overcome
we
have
need
of
labourers
inured
to
labour
i
can
not

will
never

and

sidenote
malady
of
petty
questions
in
farel
heart
overwhelming
depression
often
followed
close
upon
the
fairest
expectations
one
sorrow
especially
afflicted
him
the
malady
of
petty
questions
seemed
threatening
to
invade
the
new
church
at
all
times
narrow
and
minds
attach
themselves
to
certain
details
in
the
doctrine
of
baptism
the
lord
supper
the
ministry
and
so
forth
they
are
eager
about
and
and
by
their
minutiæ
encumber
the
kingdom
of
christ
farel
who
with
a
holy
doctrine
and
unwearied
activity
combined
a
wise
discernment
and
a
large
liberal
spirit
trembled
lest
this
weakness
of
little
understandings
had
crept
into
the
minds
of
the
ministers
to
whom
he
addressed
his
call
there
happened
to
be
at
strasburg
just
then
a
christian
man
named
andronicus
whom
the
reformer
desired
to
attract
into
switzerland
but
he
wished
to
know
whether
he
was
tainted
with
formalism
or
evils
which
sometimes
met
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
he
resolved
to
speak
frankly
to
him
and
his
letter
shows
us
his
opinion
of
the
ministry
brother
he
wrote
to
andronicus
you
possess
christ
so
as
to
teach
him
purely
apart
from
the
empty
controversies
of
and
and
which
in
the
eyes
of
many
constitute
christianity
are
you
content
to
require
of
all
that
renouncing
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
they
should
arm
themselves
with
faith
and
press
to
their
hearts
the
heavenly
treasure
christ
who
sitteth
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
are
you
ready
to
give
to
all
authorities
what
is
their
pay
them
not
only
to
the
ungodly
but
also
to
the
brethren
do
you
seek
christ
glory
only
do
you
propose
simply
to
plant
in
their
hearts
the
faith
that
worketh
by
charity
are
you
resolved
to
bear
the
cross
for
be
assured
the
cross
awaits
you
at
the
door
if
you
are
ready
to
bear
it
then
dear
brother
come
instantly
such
was
the
wise
language
of
the
most
ardent
of
the
reformers
sidenote
farel
mode
of
recruiting
while
farel
was
thus
loudly
calling
for
new
workers
he
was
getting
rid
of
the
idle
and
cowardly
promising
to
all
of
them
fatigue
insult
and
persecution
it
was
with
such
promises
that
the
reformer
levied
his
soldiers
not
look
for
idleness
but
for
labour
he
said
after
fatigue
will
you
find
repose
and
you
will
not
reap
until
after
you
have
sown
at
your
own
cost
a
wide
door
is
opened
but
no
one
can
enter
except
those
who
desire
to
feed
the
sheep
and
not
to
devour
them
and
who
are
determined
to
reply
with
kindness
to
the
insults
with
which
they
are
assailed
labour
and
toil
await
you
i
can
promise
you
nothing
but
trouble
if
you
will
come
with
us
know
that
you
are
entering
into
a
hard
service
you
will
have
to
fight
not
against
craven
and
disheartened
adversaries
but
against
enemies
brimful
of
decision
and
strength
be
therefore
a
brave
and
noble
soldier
attack
the
enemy
joyfully
and
rush
into
the
hottest
of
the
fight
placing
your
confidence
in
god
to
whom
alone
belong
the
battle
and
the
victory
it
is
not
we
who
fight
but
the
lord
but
farel
called
to
the
battle
in
vain
the
timid
recruits
would
not
join
the
army
he
received
some
little
help
indeed
but
what
was
that
for
so
great
a
work
then
his
appeals
grew
louder
in
the
presence
of
the
gigantic
alps
this
humble
man
rose
like
them
his
language
swelled
and
resembled
rather
the
cry
of
a
soldier
struggling
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
ranks
than
the
sweet
and
subtle
voice
of
the
gospel
of
peace
are
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
he
said
conflict
is
terrible
we
are
fighting
man
to
man
but
the
lord
giveth
the
victory
to
his
own
take
up
the
sword
set
the
helmet
on
your
head
buckle
on
the
breastplate
hang
the
shield
to
your
arm
gird
your
loins
and
being
thus
armed
with
the
panoply
of
god
rush
into
the
midst
of
the
battle
hurl
the
darts
throw
down
the
enemy
on
every
side
and
put
all
the
army
to
but
alas
instead
of
joining
the
soldiers
of
christ
instead
of
rushing
into
the
lord
battles
you
fear
the
cross
and
the
dangers
that
lie
in
wait
for
you
preferring
your
own
ease
you
refuse
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
your
brethren
is
that
the
behaviour
of
a
christian
the
holy
scriptures
declare
that
the
lord
will
exact
a
severe
reckoning
for
such
cowardice
beware
lest
you
bury
the
talent
you
have
received
call
to
mind
that
you
must
give
an
account
of
all
those
souls
whom
tyranny
holds
captive
in
its
gloomy
dungeons
you
can
set
the
light
before
their
eyes
you
can
deliver
them
from
their
chains
you
must
conjure
them
to
throw
themselves
into
the
arms
of
jesus
christ
do
not
hesitate
christ
must
be
preferred
to
everything
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
what
your
wife
wishes
and
requires
but
about
what
god
asks
and
commands
more
powerful
solicitations
had
never
been
made
there
was
a
new
paul
in
the
world
at
this
time
at
last
farel
earnestness
prevailed
andronicus
and
others
hastened
to
him
and
laboured
with
him
in
the
country
that
stretches
from
basle
and
berne
as
far
as
geneva
sidenote
first
battle
of
grandson
delighted
at
receiving
such
helpers
the
reformer
hastened
to
fresh
combats
every
parish
village
and
town
was
to
be
won
to
christ
by
an
obstinate
struggle
there
is
no
soldier
that
has
fought
more
battles
we
can
only
find
a
parallel
to
farel
in
the
convert
of
damascus
he
took
with
him
de
glautinis
minister
of
tavannes
in
the
bernese
jura
who
had
come
to
his
help
and
quitted
orbe
leaving
on
his
left
the
picturesque
gorge
of
the
jura
where
the
village
of
croix
lies
hid
and
over
which
soar
the
lofty
tops
of
the
chasseron
and
turned
his
steps
towards
grandson
ere
long
he
came
in
sight
of
the
celebrated
walls
of
the
old
castle
which
stood
near
the
extremity
of
the
lake
of
neuchâtel
this
place
which
was
about
to
become
an
evangelical
had
witnessed
a
far
different
struggle
here
in
the
swiss
had
rushed
from
the
heights
of
champagne
and
bonvillars
while
the
terrible
roaring
of
the
bull
of
uri
portended
death
and
the
cow
of
unterwald
uttered
its
warning
sound
here
they
bent
the
knee
in
presence
of
the
hostile
columns
and
rising
with
shouts
of
playing
their
fearful
music
unfurling
their
ancient
banners
and
guarding
them
with
their
long
and
formidable
spears
they
charged
the
burgundians
with

of

six

this
vigorous

victory
the

type
of
the
work

was
to
accomplish

about

they
begged

very
coolly
the
name

to
grant
them
the
use
of

but
guy

a
resolute
man

accordingly
farel
de

and
a
few
of
the
brethren
proceeded
to
the
benedictine
convent
they
knocked
and
the
door
was
opened
several
monks
appeared
as
they
knew
already
something
about
the
arrival
of
the
missionaries
they
looked
at
them
from
head
to
foot
and
farel
had
scarcely
asked
permission
to
preach
when
a
loud
uproar
arose
in
the
cloister
the
sacristan
hid
a
pistol
under
his
frock
another
friar
armed
himself
with
a
knife
and
both
came
forward
stealthily
to
lay
hands
upon
the
who
according
to
them
was
disturbing
all
the
churches
the
sacristan
arrived
first
pointing
the
pistol
at
farel
with
one
hand
he
seized
him
with
the
other
and
pulling
him
along
endeavoured
to
drag
him
into
the
convent
where
a
prison
awaited
him
de

observing
this
sprang
forward
to

his
friend
but
the
other
monk
arriving
at
the
scene
of
combat
fell
upon
him
flourishing
his
knife
alarmed
by
the
noise
within
the
cloister
the
friends
of
the
evangelists
who
had
remained
at
the
door
waiting
to
know
whether
they
could
hear
farel
or
not
rushed
in
and
tore
both
him
and
his
comrade
from
the
stout
arms
of
the
monks
the
gates
of
the
monastery
were
closed
immediately
and
they
remained
so
for
a
whole
fortnight
so
great
was
the
terror
inspired
by
the
reformers

seeing
there
was
nothing

de
glautinis
whom
he
left
behind
him
to
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
proclaim
the
gospel
the
monks
entrenched
within
their
walls
trembled
deliberated
kept
watch
and
armed
themselves
against
this
one
man
as
if
they
had
an
army
before
them
convent
gates
and
church
doors
were
all
close
shut
de
glautinis
finding
that
he
could
not
preach
in
the
churches
determined
to
preach
in
the
streets
and
in
private
houses
but
he
had
hardly
begun
when
the
monks
informed
by
the
signals
of
their
agents
whom
they
had
instructed
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
evangelist
made
a
vigorous
sally
guy
regis
the
valiant
superior
of
the
gray
friars
the
precentor
and
all
the
monks
came
to
the
place
where
de
glautinis
was
preaching
and
boldly
placed
themselves
between
him
and
his
hearers
said
the
superior
if
you
dare
before
the
king
or
the
emperor
come
to
besançon
to
dôle
or
to
paris
i
will
show
you
and
all
the
world
that
your
preaching
is
mere
witchcraft
begone
we
have
had
enough
of
you
you
shall
not
enter
the
churches
as
soon
as
this
harangue
was
over
the
monks
capped
it
by
roaring
out
son
of
a
jew
apostate
the
troop
having
thus
fired
their
volley
hastily
retreated
within
their
walls
some
bernese
deputies
who
chanced
to
be
at
neuchâtel
hearing
what
was
going
on
at
grandson
went
thither
without
delay
they
did
not
wish
to
force
the
people
to
be
converted
but
they
desired
that
all
under
their
rule
should
hear
the
gospel
without
hindrance
and
thus
have
liberty
to
decide
with
full
knowledge
for
rome
or
for
the
reformation
when
the
bernese
lords
arrived
at
grandson
which
is
not
far
from
neuchâtel
they
ordered
the
conventual
churches
to
be
thrown
open
to
the
reformers
a
messenger
was
sent
to
farel
who
returned
immediately
bringing
viret
with
him
and
from
the
may
the
three
evangelists
began
to
preach
sundays
and
the
monks
surprised
irritated
and
yet
restrained
by
fear
of
their
dread
lords
looked
with
gloomy
eyes
on
the
crowd
that
came
to
hear
the
the
superior
of
the
gray
friars
who
had
a
great
reputation
for
learning
thought
himself
called
upon
to
resist
the
reformers
they
had
hardly
left
the
pulpit
when
he
entered
it
and
thus
farel
and
guy
regis
attacked
and
refuted
each
other
struggling
so
to
say
hand
to
hand
the
evangelist
preached
grace
the
monk
prescribed
works
the
former
reproached
his
opponent
with
disobeying
scripture
the
latter
reproached
the
other
with
disobeying
the
church
the
monks
went
further
still
they
conjured
the
magistrates
to
come
to
the
defence
of
the
faith
and
the
latter
outlawed
the
ministers
while
the
sergeants
arrested
them
the
populace
seeing
them
in
the
hands
of
the
officers
followed
them
and
covered
them
with
abuse
and
they
were
shut
up
in
prison
thus
the
struggle
descended
to
the
people
and
grew
all
the
warmer
parties
were
formed
bands
were
organised
the
catholics
in
order
to
distinguish
themselves
stuck
in
their
caps
and
thus
adorned
stalked
proudly
through
the
streets
their
adversaries
said
to
them
as
they
passed
insult
messieurs
of
berne
to
which
they
arrogantly
answered
shall
not
prevent
us
sidenote
reinforcement
from
yverdun
the
inhabitants
of
yverdun
a
neighbouring
town
which
eagerly
espoused
the
cause
defended
by
guy
regis
organised
not
a
troop
of
soldiers
but
a
procession
it
quitted
the
town
and
passed
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
clerical
banners
instead
of
military
colours
waved
above
their
heads
sacred
chants
instead
of
drums
and
trumpets
filled
the
air
at
last
this
curious
reinforcement
reached
the
city
where
such
a
fierce
struggle
was
going
on
the
catholics
no
longer
doubted
of
victory
minds
grew
heated
and
their
passions
were
inflamed
farel
and
his
friends
having
been
set
at
liberty
a
black
friar
named
claude
de
boneto
stuck
to
the
reformer
and
loaded
him
with
abuse
the
latter
undismayed
said
withdraw
from
the
pope
who
has
laid
insupportable
burdens
on
your
back
which
he
will
not
touch
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
come
to
him
who
has
taken
all
your
burden
and
placed
it
on
his
own
shoulders
do
not
trust
in
the
priests
or
in
rome
have
confidence
in
jesus
christ
the
council
of
berne
took
up
the
defence
of
the
evangelist
and
condemned
friar
boneto
as
the
support
of
yverdun
had
produced
no
effect
help
was
sent
from
lausanne
on
john
day
june
a
cordelier
arrived
at
grandson
to
preach
in
honour
of
the
saint
the
church
of
the
franciscans
was
soon
crowded
and
farel
and
de
glautinis
were
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
the
strange
things
which
the
preacher
said
filled
them
with
sorrow
presently
the
reformer
stood
up
and
as
was
the
custom
of
the
times
began
to
refute
the
monk
the
latter
stopped
and
the
eyes
of
the
assembly
were
turned
upon
the
minister
with
signs
of
anger
the
bailiff
john
reyff
of
friburg
a
good
catholic
unable
to
restrain
himself
raised
his
hand
and
struck
farel
this
was
the
signal
for
a
battle
judges
gray
friars
and
burgesses
of
grandson
who
had
come
armed
to
the
church
fell
upon
the
two
ministers
threw
them
to
the
ground
and
showered
blows
and
kicks
upon
them
their
friends
hastened
to
their
help
flung
themselves
into
the
midst
of
the
fray
and
succeeded
in
rescuing
the
reformers
from
the
hands
of
the
riotous
crowd
but
not
before
they
had
been
maltreated
in
the
face
and
other
parts
the
grand
banneret
of
orbe
saw
it
and
it
is
he
who
tells
the
story
sidenote
the
sentinels
the
evangelicals
lost
no
time
one
of
them
started
off
at
once
to
see
the
sieur
de
watteville
the
avoyer
of
berne
who
chanced
to
be
at
his
estate
of
colombier
three
leagues
from
grandson
that
magistrate
went
to
the
town
and
wishing
to
put
the
inhabitants
in
a
position
to
exercise
the
right
of
free
enquiry
according
to
the
principles
of
berne
he
ordered
the
cordelier
and
farel
to
preach
by
turns
and
then
went
to
the
church
attended
by
his
servant
with
the
view
of
hearing
both
preachers
but
there
was
something
else
to
be
done
first
the
people
were
still
agitated
with
the
emotions
of
the
preceding
day
and
pretended
that
the
reformers
wanted
to
pull
down
the
great
crucifix
which
was
much
respected
by
all
the
city
two
monks
tissot
and
gondoz
were
distinguished
by
their
zeal
for
the
doctrines
of
the
pope
sincere
but
fanatical
they
would
have
thought
they
were
doing
god
a
service
by
murdering
farel
they
had
been
posted
as
sentinels
to
defend
the
image
supposed
to
be
threatened
armed
with
axes
hidden
under
their
frocks
they
paced
backwards
and
forwards
silent
and
watchful
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
gallery
where
the
famous
crucifix
stood
when
the
lord
of
berne
appeared
one
of
the
sentinels
seeing
a
strange
face
which
had
an
heretical
look
about
it
stopped
him
abruptly
back
you
can
not
pass
this
way
he
said
while
his
comrade
rudely
pushed
the
sieur
de
watteville
said
the
avoyer
in
a
grave
tone
should
not
get
in
such
a
heat
the
patrician
exasperated
at
this
want
of
respect
to
his
master
and
less
calm
than
he
was
caught
the
cowled
sentinel
round
the
body
and
feeling
the
axe
under
his
frock
took
it
away
and
was
about
to
strike
him
with
it
when
the
bernese
lord
checked
him
all
the
monks
fled
in
alarm
and
de
watteville
remaining
master
of
the
ground
placed
his
servant
there
on
guard
the
latter
stalking
up
and
down
with
the
axe
on
his
shoulder
kept
watch
instead
of
the
monks
he
had
been
there
only
a
few
minutes
when
about
thirty
women
with
flashing
eyes
and
sullen
air
each
holding
her
serge
apron
gathered
up
in
front
made
their
appearance
and
endeavoured
to
get
into
the
gallery
some
had
filled
their
aprons
with
mould
from
their
gardens
and
others
with
ashes
from
their
kitchens
and
with
these
weapons
they
were
marching
to
battle
their
plan
was
not
indeed
to
engage
in
a
regular
fight
but
to
lie
in
ambush
in
the
gallery
near
the
pulpit
and
then
as
soon
as
farel
appeared
to
throw
the
ashes
into
his
eyes
and
the
earth
into
his
mouth
and
so
silence
the
fearless
preacher
of
the
gospel
this
was
their
notion
of
controversy
the
troop
approached
the
firm
as
became
a
servant
of
my
lord
of
berne
was
still
pacing
to
and
fro
axe
in
hand
he
perceived
the
feminine
battalion
immediately
saw
what
was
their
intention
and
advanced
brandishing
the
weapon
he
had
taken
from
the
monks
the
devotees
of
grandson
seeing
a
bernese
instead
of
a
gray
friar
were
alarmed
they
shrieked
let
go
their
aprons
suffered
the
mould
and
ashes
to
fall
upon
the
floor
of
the
church
and
ran
off
to
their
homes
sidenote
conversion
of
the
monks
the
conspiracies
of
the
monks
and
of
the
women
being
thus
baffled
the
bernese
magistrate
did
not
take
advantage
of
it
to
make
farel
preach
alone
he
wished
the
balance
to
be
even
the
gray
friar
therefore
and
the
reformer
quietly
took
their
turns
tissot
and
gondoz
who
had
stopped
de
watteville
were
imprisoned
for
a
fortnight
the
two
monks
recovering
from
their
passion
began
to
consider
what
this
could
be
which
possessed
such
stanch
adherents
the
reformers
visited
them
and
showed
them
much
affection
the
monks
were
touched
they
saw
that
the
heresy
of
which
they
had
been
so
afraid
was
simply
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
they
left
the
prison
with
new
thoughts
and
two
years
later
says
the
banneret
received
the
lutheran
law
were
made
preachers
one
at
fontaines
the
other
at
chavornay
married
and
had
a
large
family
of
children
in
the
days
of
the
reformation
as
in
those
of
the
apostles
it
was
often
seen
that
those
who
against
the
pricks
obtained
mercy
and
became
heralds
of
the
faith
a
last
tumult
was
to
cause
the
principles
of
religious
liberty
to
be
proclaimed
in
switzerland
it
occurred
at
orbe
during
the
christmas
holidays
the
catholics
proud
of
the
midnight
devotions
customary
among
them
at
that
season
of
the
year
insulted
the
reformed
to
bed
they
said
we
are
singing
the
praises
of
god
in
the
church
you
will
be
sleeping
in
your
beds
like
the
reformers
who
did
not
like
midnight
masses
with
all
their
profanations
desired
to
take
advantage
of
the
evening
hours
when
the
cessation
of
labour
gave
an
opportunity
of
collecting
a
large
congregation
at
seven
on
christmas
eve
they
asked
the
governor
for
the
keys
of
the
church
is
not
sermon
time
he
answered
you
shall
not
have
them
they
rejoined
that
every
hour
except
at
night
was
sermon
time
and
being
determined
to
begin
the
evening
services
they
went
to
the
church
opened
the
doors
the
preacher
got
up
into
the
pulpit
and
in
a
moment
the
place
was
crowded
a
few
priests
or
bigots
peeping
into
the
building
exclaimed
in
surprise
at
the
crowd
devil
must
have
sent
a
good
many
there
the
minister
it
may
have
been
viret
explained
the
great
mystery
of
faith
the
coming
of
the
saviour
and
asked
his
hearers
if
they
would
not
receive
him
into
their
hearts
the
sermon
had
lasted
some
time
and
the
clock
struck
nine
immediately
the
bells
rang
and
the
catholics
crowded
into
the
church
although
there
was
no
service
at
that
hour
the
reformed
being
unwilling
to
quarrel
retired
home
quietly
but
a
mischievous
fellow
who
had
crept
into
the
assembly
with
the
intention
of
exciting
the
people
began
to
whisper
to
his
neighbours
that
the
heretics
were
going
to
destroy
everything
at
claire
this
was
false
but
they
believed
it
the
crowd
deserted
the
altars
and
meeting
with
a
few
reformers
in
the
streets
knocked
some
down
and
broke
the
heads
of
others
the
best
known
among
them
had
already
reached
home
but
the
catholic
population
assembled
in
front
of
their
houses
and
threw
stones
at
their
windows
viret
departed
for
berne
with
ten
of
the
reformed
in
order
to
make
his
complaint
sidenote
first
act
of
religious
liberty
a
few
days
later
on
the
january
two
hundred
and
thirty
ministers
assembled
at
berne
among
whom
was
the
wise
capito
and
formed
a
sort
of
council
having
most
of
them
left
the
romish
church
they
desired
liberty
not
only
for
themselves
but
also
for
their
adversaries
the
laymen
were
of
the
same
opinion
berne
the
representative
of
protestantism
agreed
with
friburg
the
champion
of
popery
on
this
subject
desire
said
the
bernese
every
one
should
have
free
choice
to
go
to
the
preaching
or
to
mass
we
also
said
the
friburgers
desire
that
all
should
live
in
peace
together
and
that
neither
priests
nor
preachers
should
call
their
adversaries
heretics
or
murderers
we
also
said
the
friburgers
we
do
not
wish
to
hinder
the
priests
and
preachers
from
conferring
amicably
and
fraternally
concerning
the
faith
right
said
the
friburgers
these
articles
and
others
like
first
monument
of
religious
liberty
in
published
on
the
january
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
this
proclamation
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
not
henceforward
taken
as
a
pattern
in
all
christian
countries
and
in
switzerland
where
it
was
drawn
up
the
order
did
not
for
long
prevent
violent
collisions
we
shall
now
leave
this
quarter
and
follow
elsewhere
the
great
champion
of
the
word
of
god
farel
but
we
shall
return
here
later

the

was
to
be
occupied
with

important
business
sidenote
the
waldenses
for
two
or
three
years
past
a
strange
report
had
circulated
among
the
infant
churches
that
were
forming
between
the
alps
and
the
jura
they
heard
talk
of
christians
who
belonged
to
the
reformation
without
having
ever
been
reformed
it
was
said
that
in
some
of
the
remote
valleys
of
the
alps
of
piedmont
and
dauphiny
and
in
certain
parts

recognised
no

than
holy

the
report
of
the
victories
of
the
reformation
having
penetrated
their
valleys
these
pious
men
had
listened
to
them
attentively
one
of
them
in
particular
martin
gonin
pastor
of
angrogne
was
seriously
moved
by
them
being
a
man
of
decided
and
enterprising
character
and
ready
to
give
his
life
for
the
gospel
the
pious
the
name
given
by
the
waldenses
to
their
pastors
had
felt
a
lively
desire
to
go
and
see
closely
what
the
reformation
was
this
thought
haunted
him
everywhere
whether
he
traversed
the
little
glens
which
divided
his
valley
like
a
tree
with
its
branches
or
whether
he
followed
the
course
of
the
torrent
or
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
alps
of
cella
vachera
and
infernet
gonin
sighed
after
wittemberg
and
luther
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
he
departed
in
found
his
way
to
the
reformers
and
brought
back
into
his
valleys
much
good
news
and
many
pious
books
from
that
time
the
reformation
was
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
among
the
barbes
and
shepherds
of
those
mountains
in
many
of
them
threading
the
defiles
of
the
alps
arrived
on
the
french
slopes
and
following
the
picturesque
banks
of
the
durance
took
their
way
towards
merindol
where
a
synod
of
waldensian
christians
had
been
convened
they
walked
on
animated
with
the
liveliest
joy
they
had
thought
themselves
alone
and
in
one
day
there
had
been
born
to
them
in
europe
thousands
of
brethren
who
listened
humbly
to
the
word
of
god
and
made
the
pope
tremble
on
his
throne
they
spoke
of
the
reformation
of
luther
and
melanchthon
and
of
the
swiss
as
they
descended
the
rough
mountain
paths
when
the
synod
was
formed
they
resolved
to
send
a
deputation
to
the
evangelicals
of
switzerland
to
show
them
that
the
waldensian
doctrines
were
similar
to
those
of
the
reformers
and
to
prevail
upon
the
latter
to
give
them
the
hand
of
fellowship
in
consequence
two
of
them
george
morel
and
peter
masson
set
out
for
basle
sidenote
deputation
to
œcolampadius
on
their
arrival
in
that
city
they
asked
for
the
house
of
œcolampadius
they
entered
his
study
and
the
old
times
represented
by
these
worthy
barbes
greeted
the
new
times
in
the
person
of
the
amiable
and
steadfast
reformer
the
latter
could
not
see
these
brave
and
rustic
men
standing
before
him
and
not
feel
an
emotion
of
respect
and
sympathy
the
waldenses
took
from
their
bosoms
the
documents
of
their
faith
and
presented
them
to
the
pious
doctor
away
from
antichrist
said
these
papers
and
masson
and
morel
repeated
the
words
turn
towards
christ
he
is
our
life
our
truth
our
peace
our
righteousness
our
shepherd
our
advocate
our
victim
our
who
died
for
the
salvation
of
believers
but
alas
as
smoke
goeth
before
the
fire
the
temptation
of
antichrist
precedeth
the
glory
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
antichrist
was
but
a
child
he
has
now
grown
into
a
perfect
man
he
robs
christ
of
the
merit
of
salvation
and
ascribes
it
to
his
own
works
he
strips
the
holy
ghost
of
the
power
of
regeneration
and
attributes
it
to
his
ceremonies
he
leads
the
people
to
mass
a
sad
tissue
of
jewish
pagan
and
christian
rites
and
deprives
them
of
the
spiritual
and
sacramental
manducation
he
hates
persecutes
accuses
robs
and
kills
the
members
of
jesus
christ
he
boasts
of
his
length
of
life
of
his
monks
his
virgins
his
miracles
his
fasts
and
his
vigils
and
uses
them
as
a
cloak
to
hide
his
wickedness
nevertheless
the
rebel
is
growing
old
and
decreasing
and
the
lord
is
killing
the
felon
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
œcolampadius
admired
the
simplicity
of
their
creed
he
would
not
have
liked
a
doctrine
without
life
or
an
apparent
life
without
doctrine
but
he
found
both
in
the
waldensian
barbes
thank
god
he
told
them
he
has
called
you
to
so
great
light
ere

the

and
faithful
ones

to
see
these
men
of
the
ancient
times
seated
round
the
domestic
hearth

narrated
the
sufferings
of
their
fathers
and
described
their
flocks
scattered
over
the
two
slopes
of
the
alps
people
they
said
our
origin
to
a
wealthy
citizen
of
lyons
peter
de
vaux
or
waldo
who
being
at
a
banquet
with
his
friends
saw
one
of
them
suddenly
fall
dead
moved
and
troubled
in
his
conscience
he
prayed
to
jesus
sold
his
goods
and
began
to
preach
and
sent
others
to
preach
the
gospel
everywhere
but
added
the

from
more
ancient
times
from
the
time
when
constantine
introducing
the
world
into

church

themselves
apart

even
from

apostles
sidenote
confessions
of
the
barbes
in
the
course
of
conversation
however
with
these
brethren
the
christians
of
basle
noticed
certain
points
of
doctrine
which
did
not
seem
conformable
with
evangelical
truth
and
a
certain
uneasiness
succeeded
to
their
former
joy
wishing
to
be
enlightened
œcolampadius
addressed
a
few
questions
to
the
two
barbes
our
ministers
they
answered
on
the
first
point
in
celibacy
and
work
at
some
honest
trade
however
said
œcolampadius
a
state
very
becoming
to
all
true
believers
and
particularly
to
those
who
ought
to
be
in
all
things
to
the
we
also
think
he
continued
pastors
ought
not
to
devote
to
manual
labour
as
yours
do
the
time
they
could
better
employ
in
the
study
of
scripture
the
minister
has
many
things
to
learn
god
does
not
teach
us
miraculously
and
without
labour
we
must
take
pains
in
order
to
know
the
barbes
were
at
first
a
little
confused
at
seeing
that
the
elders
had
to
learn
of
their
juniors
however
they
were
humble
and
sincere
men
and
the
basle
doctor
having
questioned
them
on
the
sacraments
they
confessed
that
through
weakness
and
fear
they
had
their
children
baptised
by
romish
priests
and
that
they
even
communicated
with
them
and
sometimes
attended
mass
this
unexpected
avowal
startled
the
meek
œcolampadius
said
he
not
christ
the
holy
victim
fully
satisfied
the
everlasting
justice
for
us
is
there
any
need
to
offer
other
sacrifices
after
that
of
golgotha
by
saying
to
the
priests
mass
you
deny
the
grace
of
jesus
christ
œcolampadius
next
spoke
of
the
strength
of
man
after
the
fall
believe
said
the
barbes
modestly
all
men
have
some
natural
virtue
just
as
herbs
plants
and
stones
have
believe
said
the
reformer
those
who
obey
the
commandments
of
god
do
so
not
because
they
have
more
strength
than
others
but
because
of
the
great
power
of
the
spirit
of
god
which
renews
their
will
said
the
barbes
who
did
not
feel
themselves
in
harmony
with
the
reformers
on
this
point
troubles
us
weak
people
so
much
as
what
we
have
heard
of
luther
teaching
relative
to
and
predestination
our
ignorance
is
the
cause
of
our
doubts
pray
instruct
us
the
charitable
œcolampadius
did
not
think
the
differences
were
such
as
ought
to
alienate
him
from
the
barbes
must
enlighten
these
christians
he
said
above
all
things
we
must
love
them
had
they
not
the
same
bible
and
the
same
saviour
as
the
children
of
the
reformation
had
they
not
preserved
the
essential
truths
of
the
faith
from
the
primitive
times
œcolampadius

his
friends
agitated
by
this
reflection
gave
their
hands
to

to

told
them
that
the
demand
that
had
been
addressed
to
them
to
separate
entirely
from

had
caused
division
among

said
to

assembled
at

explain
your
views
on
this
important
point
after

to

about
the

of
propagating
over
the

doctrine
of

is
common
to
both
of
us
no

selected
for
this
purpose
the
hamlet
of
chanforans
where
there
is
now
only
one
solitary
house
there
in
a
shady
spot
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
rugged
cliffs
and
distant
peaks
the
barbe
had
arranged
the
rude
benches
on
which
the
members
of
this
christian
assembly
were
to
sit
two
parties
met
there
face
to
face
at
the
head
of
that
which
was
unwilling
to
break
entirely
with
the
roman
catholic
church
were
two
barbes
daniel
of
valence
and
john
of
molines
who
struggled
for
the
success
of
their
system
of
accommodation
and
compliance
on
the
other
hand
farel
and
saunier
supported
the
evangelical
party
who
had
not
such
distinguished
representatives
as
the
traditional
party
and
proposed
the
definitive
rejection
of
all
doctrines
and
usages
before
the
opening
of
the
synod
the
two
ministers
finding
themselves
surrounded
by
numbers
of
the
brethren
both
in
their
homes
and
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
where
the
assembly
was
to
be
held
had
already
explained
to
them
the
faith
of
the
reformation
and
several
of
the
waldenses
had
exclaimed
that
it
was
the
doctrine
taught
from
father
to
son
among
them
and
to
which
they
were
resolved
to
adhere
yet
the
issue
of
the
combat
appeared
doubtful
for
the
party
was
strong
and
described
the
reformers
as
foreigners
and
innovators
who
had
come
there
to
alter
their
ancient
doctrines
but
farel
had
good
hopes
for
he
could
appeal
to
holy
scripture
and
even
to
the
confessions
of
the
waldenses
themselves
sidenote
opening
of
the
synod
on
the
september
the
synod
was
opened
the
name
of
god
one
party
looked
with
favour
on
farel
and
saunier
the
other
on
john
of
molines
and
daniel
of
valence
but
the
majority
appeared
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
reformation
farel
rose
and
boldly
broached
the
question
he
contended
that
there
was
no
longer
any
ceremonial
law
that
no
act
of
worship
had
any
merit
of
itself
and
that
a
multitude
of
feasts
dedications
rites
chants
and
mechanical
prayers
was
a
great
evil
he
reminded
them
that
christian
worship
consists
essentially
in
faith
in
the
gospel
in
charity
and
in
the
confession
of
christ
is
a
he
said
divine
worship
should
be
performed
spirit
and
in
the
two
barbes
strove
in
vain
to
oppose
these
views
the
meeting
testified
their
assent
to
them
did
not
their
confession
reject
feasts
vigils
of
saints
water
called
holy
the
act
of
abstaining
from
flesh
and
other
like
things
invented
by
men
the
worship
in
spirit
was
proclaimed
farel
delighted
at
this
first
victory
desired
to
win
another
and
perhaps
more
difficult
one
he
believed
that
it
was
by
means
of
the
doctrine
of
the
natural
power
of
man
that
popery
took
salvation
out
of
the
hands
of
god
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
the
priests
said
he
elected
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
all
those
who
have
been
or
who
will
be
saved
it
is
impossible
for
those
who
have
been
ordained
to
salvation
not
to
be
saved
whosoever
upholds
absolutely
denies
the
grace
of
god
this
was
a
point
which
molines
and
his
friend
resisted
with
all
their
might
but
did
not
the
waldensian
confessions
recognise
the
impotency
of
man
and
the
of
grace
did
not
they
call
the
denial
of
these
things
work
of
antichrist
farel
moreover
adduced
proof
from
scripture
the
synod
was
at
first
in
suspense
but
finally
decided
that
it
recognised
this
article
as
with
holy
scripture
certain
questions
of
morality
anxiously
occupied
the
reformer
in
his
opinion
the
romish
church
had
turned
everything
calling
those
works
which
she
prescribed
though
they
had
nothing
good
in
them
and
those
which
were
in
conformity
with
the
will
of
god
is
no
good
work
but
that
which
god
has
commanded
said
farel
none
bad
but
what
he
has
forbidden
the
assembly
expressed
their
entire
assent
sidenote
farel
opinions
gain
ground
then
continuing
the
struggle
the
firm
evangelical
doctor
successively
maintained
that
the
true
confession
of
a
christian
is
to
confess
to
god
alone
that
marriage
is
forbidden
to
no
man
whatever
his
condition
that
scripture
determines
only
two
sacraments
baptism
and
the
supper
that
christians
may
swear
in
god
name
and
fill
the
office
of
magistrate
and
finally
that
they
should
lay
aside
their
manual
occupations
on
sunday
in
order
to
have
leisure
to
praise
god
exercise
charity
and
listen
to
the
truths
of
scripture
that
is
it
said
the
delighted
waldenses
is
the
doctrine
of
our
fathers
molines
and
daniel
of
valence
did
not
however
consider
their
cause
lost
ought
not
the
fear
of
persecution
to
induce
the
waldenses
to
persevere
in
certain
dissimulations
calculated
to
secure
them
from
the
inquisitive
eyes
of
the
enemies
of
the
faith
nothing
displeased
the
reformers
so
much
as
dissembling
us
put
off
that
paint
said
calvin
which
the
gospel
is
disfigured
and
let
us
not
endeavour
slavishly
to
please
our
adversaries
let
us
go
boldly
to
work
if
we
permit
compromises
in
some
practices
the
whole
doctrine
will
fall
and
the
building
be
thrown
down
farel
thought
as
calvin
did
perceiving
this
loophole
for
the
two
barbes
he
urged
the
necessity
of
a
frank
confession
of
the
truth
the
members
of
the
assembly
pricked
in
their
consciences
by
the
remembrance
of
their
former
backslidings
bound
themselves
to
take
no
part
henceforward
in
any
romish
superstition
and
to
recognise
as
their
pastor
no
priest
of
the
pope
church
will
perform
our
worship
they
said
and
publicly
to
give
glory
to
god
the
two
barbes
who
were
no
doubt
sincere
became
more
eloquent
the
moment
was
come
that
was
to
decide
the
future
in
their
opinion
by
establishing
new
principles
they
cast
discredit
on
the
men
who
had
hitherto
directed
the
churches
no
doubt
it
was
culpable
to
take
part
in
certain
ceremonies
with
an
unworthy
object
but
was
it
so
when
it
was
done
for
good
ends
to
break
entirely
with
the
catholic
church
would
render
the
existence
of
the
waldenses
impossible
or
at
least
would
provoke
hostilities
which
would
reduce
them
completely
to
silence
farel
replied
with
wonderful
energy
maintaining
the
rights
of
truth
he
showed
them
that
every
compromise
with
error
is
a
lie
the
purity
of
the
doctrine
he
professed
his
elevated
thoughts
the
ardent
affection
expressed
by
his
voice
his
gestures
and
his
looks
electrified
the
waldenses
and
poured
into
their
souls
the
holy
fire
with
which
his
own
was
burning
these
witnesses
of
the
middle
ages
called
to
mind
how
the
children
of
israel
having
adopted
the
customs
of
people
alien
to
the
covenant
of
god
wept
abundantly
and
exclaimed
have
trespassed
against
god
the
waldenses
felt
like
them
and
desired
to
make
amends
for
their
sins
they
drew
up
a
brief
confession
in
articles
in
conformity
with
the
resolutions
that
had
been
adopted
and
then
said
adhere
with
one
accord
to
the
present
declaration
and
we
pray
god
that
of
his
great
charity
nothing
may
divide
us
henceforward
and
that
even
when
separated
from
one
another
we
may
always
remain
united
in
the
same
spirit
then
they
signed
their
names
the
agreement
was
not
however
universal
during
the
six
days
discussion
several
barbes
and
laymen
might
have
been
seen
standing
apart
in
some
shady
place
with
gloomy
air
and
uneasy
look
talking
together
on
the
resolutions
proposed
to
the
synod
at
the
moment
when
every
one
was
affixing
his
signature
to
the
confession
the
two
leaders
withheld
theirs
and
withdrew
from
the
assembly
sidenote
old
waldensian
manuscripts
during
the
discussion
and
even
before
it
farel
and
saunier
had
had
several
conversations
and
conferences
with
the
waldenses
in
the
course
of
which
the
barbes
had
displayed
their
old
manuscripts
handed
down
from
the
twelfth
century
as
they
said
the
the
the
the
and
others
these
writings
bore
the
date
of
which
probably
was
not
disputed
by
farel
one
line
of
the
seems
to
indicate
this
as
the
period
when
it
was
composed
since
then
however
more
recent
dates
have
been
assigned
to
the
other
writings
especially
to
the
and
even
to
the
in
any
case
however
these
documents
belong
to
a
time
anterior
to
the
reformation
the
waldensians
displayed
with
peculiar
pride
several
manuscript
copies
of
the
old
and
new
testament
in
the
vulgar
tongue
books
they
said
copied
correctly
by
hand
so
long
ago
as
to
be
beyond
memory
and
are
to
be
seen
in
many
families
farel
and
saunier
had
received
and
handled
these
writings
with
emotion
they
had
turned
over
the
leaves
and
at
the
heavenly
favour
accorded
to
so
small
a
people
had
rendered
thanks
to
the
lord
because
the
bible
had
never
been
taken
from
them
they
did
not
stop
there
farel
addressing
the
synod
represented
to
them
that
the
copies
being
few
in
number
they
could
only
serve
for
a
few
persons
said
he
there
are
so
many
sects
and
heresies
so
much
trouble
and
confusion
now
in
the
world
it
all
comes
from
ignorance
of
the
word
of
god
it
would
therefore
be
exceedingly
necessary
for
the
honour
of
god
and
the
of
all
christians
who
know
the
french
language
and
for
the
destruction
of
all
doctrines
repugnant
to
the
truth
to
translate
the
bible
from
the
hebrew
and
greek
tongues
into
french
no
proposal
could
be
more
welcome
to
the
waldenses
their
existence
was
due
to
their
love
of
scripture
and
all
their
treatises
and
poems
celebrated
it
the
scriptures
speak
and
we
must
believe
look
at
the
scriptures
from
beginning
to
end
thus
spoke
the
they
agreed
and
with
good
heart
to
farel
demand
busying
and
exerting
themselves
to
carry
out
the
undertaking
the
proposition
was
voted
enthusiastically
and
the
delighted
reformers
looked
with
emotion
and
joy
at
this
faithful
and
constant
people
to
whom
god
had
entrusted
for
so
many
ages
the
ark
of
the
new
covenant
and
who
were
now
inspired
with
fresh
zeal
for
his
service

affairs
of
the
empire
into
anything
like
a
reasonable
state
he
has
therefore
forsaken
the
counsels
of
men
to
have
recourse
to
the
lord
only
as
the
of
the
world
fails
me
said
his
majesty
this
morning
september
i
hope
divine
providence
will
come
to
my
assistance
the
emperor
then
confessed
and
retired
into
the
oratory
of
the
palace
to
receive
the
sacrament
he
has
also
ordered
that
prestations
confessions
communions
and
prayers
should
be
made
in
every
place
where
there
are
any
devout
people
while
these
two
individuals
were
talking
charles
came
out
of
his
oratory
de
bellegarde
made
him
a
low
bow
humbly
presented
him
the
compliments
of
the
duke
and
duchess
and
handed
him
the
letters
the
emperor
who
was
busy
told
him
to
return
the
next
morning
at
his
levée
bellegarde
did
not
fail
and
charles
received
him
with
much
kindness
me
news
of
his
highness
health
he
said
also
of
madam
my
good
sister
duchess
beatrice
and
of
my
nephew
monsieur
their
son
bellegarde
answered
his
questions
and
then
made
all
the
communications
to
the
emperor
with
which
the
duke
had
charged
him
he
hoped
the
emperor
would
immediately
enter
into
conversation
with
him
about
the
plans
formed
against
geneva
but
it
was
not
so
am
very
glad
said
charles
the
duke
has
sent
you
to
me
but
considering
my
great
occupations
be
so
good
as
to
draw
up
a
memoir
of
what
you
think
most
expedient
for
the
despatch
of
the
business
that
brings
you
here
and
then
deliver
it
to
my
lord
grandvelle
here
was
a
fresh
delay
the
minister
answer
considering
the
numerous
offices
he
filled
had
to
be
waited
for
yet
bellegarde
spoke
seven
times
with
charles
time
giving
his
majesty
some
little
information
about
the
duke
affairs
but
the
emperor
while
appearing
to
listen
to
the
disputes
between
geneva
and
turin
frequently
had
his
thoughts
elsewhere
he
was
tormented
with
the
state
of
the
empire
and
did
not
conceal
it
from
his
envoy
do
not
mean
he
said
one
day
to
bellegarde
the
duke
shall
be
either
dismissed
or
ejected
but
the
diet
of
augsburg
is
all
in
confusion
and
broken
up
i
have
no
great
hopes
it
is
a
long
while
since
i
have
found
the
princes
of
germany
thus
putting
me
off
from
day
to
day
so
that
i
am
quite
out
of
hope
and
my
head
is
confused
ah
if
it
pleased
god
that
other
princes
were
of
my
opinion
christendom
would
not
be
in
such
confusion
these
are
the
very
words
his
majesty
was
pleased
to
use
adds
bellegarde
in
his
memoir
he
was
surprised
at
them
that
man
who
knew
so
well
how
to
put
one
of
his
adversaries
in
prison
and
another
to
death
was
astonished
that
so
mighty
a
prince
as
charles
should
not
adopt
an
equally
simple
and
expeditious
method
he
ventured
to
give
the
emperor
a
little
advice
he
had
learnt
that
the
strength
of
the
protestants
was
in
their
union
he
said
up
the
alliances
as
well
past
as
future
which
have
been
formed
to
your
great
prejudice
and
whose
consequences
are
so
dangerous
present
said
charles
is
no
time
i
can
not
now
reduce
the
princes
and
cities
of
germany
that
are
opposed
to
the
faith
but
i
am
determined
not
to
abandon
the
work
and
when
i
have
completed
it
what
concerns
his
highness
be
sure
you
tell
him
will
not
be
forgotten
this
then
was
charles
plan
first
to
crush
the
protestants
of
germany
and
then
the
huguenots
of
geneva
in
his
opinion
these
were
as
dangerous
for
the
latin
races
as
the
former
for
the
germans
sidenote
the
emperor
answer
at
last
on
the
october
grandvelle
chancellor
of
the
empire
he
was
the
father
of
the
famous
cardinal
accompanied
by
the
commander
had
an
interview
with
bellegarde
and
gave
him
the
emperor
answer
respect
to
geneva
his
majesty
thinks
that
to
avoid
falling
into
the
danger
which
the
duke
has
at
all
times
feared
and
avoided
no
part
or
parcel
of
his
states
must
become
swiss
you
must
take
all
the
more
precaution
because
the
nature
of
the
cantons
is
always
to
extend
and
grow
larger
and
the
rebellion
and
obstinacy
of
messieurs
of
geneva
will
incline
them
to
plunge
through
despair
into
this
accursed
error
that
would
cause
loss
and
damage
to
the
duke
and
little
credit
to
the
emperor
considering
that
geneva
is
a
fief
of
the
empire
here
is
the
expedient
the
emperor
has
hit
upon
he
orders
both
the
duke
and
geneva
to
lay
before
him
within
two
months
their
titles
rights
and
privileges
and
his
majesty
will
then
decide
as
for
the
prelates
the
bishop
and
the
canons
the
emperor
recommends
both
them
and
the
duke
to
bring
their
quarrels
to
an
end
by
so
doing
the
duke
will
get
rid
of
a
great
load
of
trouble
and
will
have
the
prelates
better
under
his
direction
and
obedience
after
a
few
other
communications
the
chancellor
withdrew
with
the
commander
and
bellegarde
immediately
sent
off
a
despatch
conveying
this
decision
to
the
duke
sidenote
bellegarde
letter
the
sieur
de
bellegarde
left
augsburg
not
long
after
and
returned
to
turin
determined
to
urge
his
master
more
than
ever
to
destroy
independence
and
the
reformation
in
geneva
at
one
blow
what
he
had
seen
at
augsburg
and
the
dangers
with
which
german
protestantism
threatened
the
supremacy
of
the
pope
and
of
the
emperor
had
increased
his
zeal
the
institutions
of
the
middle
ages
seem
to
have
had
at
that
time
no
friend
more
fanatical
and
no
champion
more
zealous
than
the
active
intelligent
devoted
cruel
courtier
who
had
put
levrier
to
death
at
the
castle
of
bonne
lord
he
said
to
the
duke
the
peril
to
which
you
are
exposed
in
this
business
of
geneva
either
because
of
the
neighbours
who
are
so
near
and
are
ravening
wolves
or
because
of
the
little
faith
the
world
now
has
in
all
the
qualities
sound
right
and
reasons
a
man
may
have
what
will
happen
if
we
do
not
remain
masters
in
the
struggle
with
this
new
sect
what
vexations
losses
and
cares
you
know
that
better
than
i
do
they
want
to
keep
you
in
good
humour
my
lord
but
it
is
only
the
better
to
make
game
of
you
and
to
increase
at
your
expense
on
this
side
of
the
mountains
or
on
in
fact
you
have
documents
in
your
chamber
to
show
that
the
genevans
used
to
pay
you
toll
and
subsidy
that
they
helped
to
portion
the
daughters
of
your
house
and
further
that
they
gave
your
predecessors
aid
in
time
of
war
and
that
in
time
of
peace
they
appealed
to
them
in
their
suits
and
sentences
and
now
what
have
they
done
they
have
deprived
you
of
the
vidamy
they
have
taken
from
you
the
castle
on
the
island
they
have
committed
much
injustice
to
the
prejudice
of
your
rights
and
have
been
guilty
of
murder
and
other
intolerable
evils
worse
still
they
are
joining
perverse
in
order
to
complete
their
ruin
sidenote
his
plans
against
geneva
we
shall
soon
put
an
end
to
it
all
my
lord
you
have
an
emperor
at
your
service
on
whom
everything
depends
will
they
dare
be
wicked
and
rebellious
in
his
presence
firstly
the
emperor
will
replace
them
under
your
authority
as
you
and
your
ancestors
had
them
next
for
their
rebellion
and
the
crimes
they
have
committed
he
will
condemn
them
to
be
deprived
of
some
that
which
is
most
injurious
to
you
finally
he
will
build
for
you
for
your
government
a
castle
or
fortress
in
the
city
in
whatever
part
you
like
and
exact
from
the
genevans
for
the
support
of
the
garrison
a
tax
to
be
paid
every
year
the
city
will
thus
be
kept
well
in
subjection
as
for
the
bishops
the
emperor
will
command
them
to
pay
you
the
respect
which
belongs
to
the
holy
empire
as
being
its
representative
he
will
order
them
to
obey
you
like
himself
and
will
restore
them
to
all
obedience
towards
you
considering
also
that
time
for
their
reformation
as
is
but
and
if
the
said
people
of
geneva
will
not
obey
as
their
unreason
may
incline
them
the
emperor
will
put
them
under
the
ban
of
the
empire
as
rebels
and
you
shall
seize
them
will
make
them
your
subjects
entirely
confiscating
all
their
privileges
and
and
thus
you
will
be
for
ever
established
rightfully
in
geneva
we
should
not
perhaps
have
quoted
the
words
of
the
sieur
de
bellegarde
at
such
length
if
the
document
from
which
they
are
extracted
had
not
been
hitherto
unknown
his
allegations
were
false
no
presents
had
ever
been
made
by
the
city
of
geneva
to
the
dukes
of
savoy
without
a
special
act
declaring
that
the
liberality
was
spontaneous
and
without
prejudice
for
the
future
the
vidamy
was
a
fief
conferred
by
the
bishop
which
made
the
holder
of
it
an
officer
of
the
latter
lastly
the
dukes
of
savoy
were
not
vicars
of
the
emperor
but
if
bellegarde
allegations
as
to
the
past
were
false
his
schemes
as
to
the
future
were
outrageous
a
strong
fortress
shall
be
built
in
geneva
the
citizens
shall
pay
the
garrison
and
a
brutal
serfdom
shall
withdraw
them
from
that
and
keep
them
for
ever
in
strict
obedience
under
the
yoke
of
their
master
as
for
the
bishops
they
shall
be
compelled
to
obey
the
duke
especially
as
the
time
of
general
approaches
it
would
appear
then
that
in
the
sixteenth
century
already
as
bellegarde
says
demanded
the
abolition
of
the
temporal
power
of
ecclesiastical
princes
were
they
more
advanced
then
than
in
our
days
i
think
not
this
rude
policy
aimed
merely
at
substituting
the
despotism
of
princes
for
the
despotism
of
bishops
as
being
stricter
and
more
effectual
end
crowns
the
the
genevans
resist
they
shall
be
conquered
and
all
their
power
and
property
confiscated
in
this
manner
concludes
the
advocate
of
these
revolutionary
measures
the
rights
of
his
master
will
be
for
ever
secured
this
is
what
geneva
had
to
expect
from
savoy
what
had
it
to
hope
from
the
bishop
pierre
de
la
baume
indignant
at
the
duke
pretensions
had
said
to
him
one
day
proudly
am
subject
only
to
the
pope
he
had
lately
softened
down
in
appearance
at
least
and
was
drawing
nearer
to
savoy
so
that
the
genevans
said
prince
is
reconciled
with
our
enemy
we
are
now
transported
into
quite
another
sphere
if
the
duke
wished
to
reign
by
force
the
bishop
desired
to
use
stratagem
the
pastor
of
geneva
was
not
in
a
position
to
build
a
fortress
in
the
middle
of
the
city
it
was
by
means
of
negotiations
and
intrigues
that
he
would
crush
the
reformation
and
liberty
the
lion
was
succeeded
by
the
serpent
pierre

knowing
the
influence
besançon
hugues
had
over
his
solicited
his
help
he
wrote
to
him
during
the
last
year
of
besançon
life
a
series
of
letters
we
have
also
had
the
good
fortune
to
discover
the
bishop
and
the
citizen
of
geneva
were
not
such
good
friends
as
they
had
been
the
former
addressed
many
reproaches
to
the
latter
either
because
hugues
was
dissatisfied
on
political
grounds
or
perhaps
because
his
catholicism
had
cooled
down
a
little
in
his
frequent
interviews
with
the
reformed
of
berne
sidenote
the
bishop
secretary
in
geneva
on
the
of
april
the
bishop
then
at
arbois
impatient
to
recover
his
former
power
in
geneva
resolved
to
open
the
campaign
and
wrote
to
hugues
i
have
always
done
for
you
everything
that
i
could
you
have
seen
it
by
the
results
i
do
not
speak
to
reproach
you
but
i
am
astonished
that
you
should
requite
me
so
ill
if
you
had
as
good
an
affection
for
me
as
i
have
given
you
opportunity
you
would
have
aboyé
so
well
that
my
authority
would
not
have
fallen
to
its
present
depression
and
i
should
not
have
the
trouble
which
i
must
take
of
restoring
it
i
well
know
the
excuses
that
you
can
make
none
is
so
deaf
as
he
that
will
not
hear
nevertheless
i
have
trusted
in
you
and
i
still
trust
in
your
fidelity
so
act
i
pray
that
i
may
have
cause
to
continue
it
in
a
little
time
i
shall
send
one
of
my
people
to
geneva
on
business
you
will
hear
the
rest
from
him
i
pray
god
that
he
will
give
you
besançon
all
that
you
desire
ten
days
later
machard
the
bishop
secretary
came
from
arbois
to
geneva
charged
with
a
political
mission
and
bearer
of
another
letter
for
hugues
which
either
on
account
of
the
delicate
matters
to
which
it
related
or
because
machard
was
to
explain
them
verbally
is
rather
obscure
hugues
hastened
to
read
the
missive
send
my
secretary
said
de
la
baume
certain
business
which
i
have
instructed
him
to
communicate
to
you
first
you
will
give
credit
to
what
he
says
in
my
name
as
if
i
said
it
myself
i
desire
that
the
affair
in
question
may
come
to
a
good
end
in
order
to
gratify
the
princes
from
whom
it
proceeds
the
emperor
and
the
duke
no
doubt
set
a
willing
hand
to
it
so
that
there
may
be
friendly
relations
between
me
and
my
subjects
and
the
said
princes
which
is
a
thing
of
no
trifling
consequence
to
all
the
republic
hugues
did
not
care
to
enter
into
the
plans
formed
by
the
bishop
in
accord
with
the
princes
so
that
when
machard
returned
to
arbois
and
made
his
report
his
master
was
much
annoyed
he
complained
of
the
excessive
boldness
and
strange
insubordination
of
the
genevans
and
wrote
bitterly
to
the
he
said
news
that
you
have
given
me
of
berne
are
a
little
compensation
for
the
insolence
and
ill
practices
that
you
and
my
subjects
show
towards
my
officers
usurping
my
jurisdiction
under
the
shelter
of
certain
words
that
you
have
uttered
before
the
general
council
i
intend
to
uphold
this
same
jurisdiction
in
opposition
to
you
indeed
i
have
done
so
against
greater
folks
i
hope
that
you
will
return
to
your
duty
and
become
my
subjects
once
more
that
will
give
me
the
opportunity
of
being
a
good
master
otherwise
do
not
trust
to
me
matters
shall
not
remain
where
you
have
left
them
communicate
this
to
my
subjects
if
need
be
sidenote
the
bishop
anger
the
bishop
was
angry
with
geneva
as
this
letter
more
sometimes
less
but
always
restless
and
agitated
one
day
he
was
told
of
something
hugues
had
said
which
delighted
him
not
long
after
he
would
hear
of
something
the
genevans
had
done
that
increased
his
anger
about
the
may
when
he
was
informed
that
hugues
had
displayed
a
very
good
feeling
towards
him
the
prelate
was
quite
delighted
and
wrote
to
him
have
been
informed
of
your
intention
to
declare
everywhere
the
wrong
that
my
subjects
are
doing
me
you
will
show
me
i
hope
by
good
actions
when
i
shall
require
it
of
you
that
you
are
not
a
man
of
but
ere
long
other
tidings
reached
the
bishop
he
was
filled
with
trouble
fear
and
pain
and
gave
way
to
all
the
emotions
of
a
restless
and
suspicious
policy
he
had
fits
of
anger
he
became
rash
violent
then
he
would
suddenly
collapse
he
had
neither
strength
feeling
nor
courage
in
general
however
it
was
indignation
that
prevailed
in
him
not
one
of
his
officers
or
of
the
canons
for
there
was
a
collegiate
church
at
arbois
understood
him
or
consoled
him
or
encouraged
him
he
was
alone
and
vented
his
agitation
in
his
apartments
or
in
his
gardens
think
the
answers
made
by
my
subjects
very
strange
he
said
should
be
sorry
to
be
angry
with
them
a
few
days
later
he
wrote
am
quite
amazed
it
seems
that
my
subjects
do
not
understand
their
business
if
they
do
not
mend
i
shall
be
forced
to
proceed
in
another
way
which
will
displease
me
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
do
well
to
obey
their
lord
and
not
act
the
prince
it
can
not
last
sidenote
letter
to
hugues
but
it
did
last
geneva
where
they
were
listening
to
olivetan
where
they
were
placarding
everywhere
by
the
side
of
the
pardon
of
rome
great
general
pardon
of
jesus
christ
where
the
council
unanimously
ordered
the
gospel
to
be
preached
to
the
truth
without
any
mixture
of
fable
whatever
pierre
de
la
baume
might
say
or
do
was
separating
from
the
bishop
and
the
pope
on
the
september
the
bishop
more
exasperated
than
ever
wrote
again
to
besançon
hugues
but
with
an
increase
of
am
displeased
with
the
way
my
subjects
treat
me
from
day
to
day
declaring
that
they
will
rise
against
my
authority
that
will
last
as
long
as
it
can
i
have
always
been
but
now
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
be
angry
if
i
attempt
to
do
anything
from
which
the
genevans
will
reap
neither
pleasure
nor
profit
they
must
not
be
surprised
certainly
i
have
little
to
thank
my
servants
or
my
friends
for
serving
me
so
badly
i
think
besançon
that
you
desire
what
is
right
but
i
should
like
to
see
the
fruits
the
people
always
find
excuses
in
you
they
say
that
i
have
allowed
their
proceedings
i
do
not
understand
that
and
i
affirm
that
i
said
nothing
with
that
intention
from
which
may
god
keep
them
bishop
of
geneva
it
was
reported
at
geneva
that
the
bishop
was
willing
to
make
some
concessions
that
he
had
said
so
privately
and
the
huguenots
took
advantage
of
it
to
assert
their
independence
on
the
november
pierre
de
la
baume
wrote
to
besançon
hugues
from
the
tour
de
mai
i
have
seen
what
you
wrote
touching
the
mode
of
proceeding
against
my
authority
and
to
the
detriment
of
my
church
i
know
whence
that
comes
except
that
i
have
always
been
given
to
understand
that
according
to
the
common
opinion
my
subjects
would
have
been
much
better
guided
and
would
have
obeyed
me
better
than
they
have
done
if
you
had
been
willing
to
set
your
hand
to
it
as
you
had
promised
me
endeavouring
to
procure
the
peace
of
the
city
which
suffers
the
greatest
loss
on
my
part
as
to
what
you
write
about
being
under
my
displeasure
the
only
regret
i
feel
as
regards
you
is
that
you
have
not
been
willing
to
do
what
you
promised
the
recompense
i
made
you
was
to
the
end
that
you
might
keep
my
possessions
in
peace
but
they
are
more
than
ever
in
war
it
is
entirely
your
fault
if
my
jurisdiction
is
not
still
kept
up
i
write
to
you
in
order
that
you
may
perform
your
duty
you
will
do
me
a
pleasure
i
would
not
have
so
many
words
to
be
without
result
as
for
me
i
am
accustomed
to
do
shall
consider
what
it
must
such
are
the
threatening
words
which
close
the
correspondence
of
pierre
de
la
baume
with
besançon
hugues
until
now
all
traces
of
this
great
citizen
had
been
lost
after
the
september
if
the
letter
we
have
just
given
belongs
to
this
year
that
limit
would
be
shortened
by
two
months
he
must
have
died
between
the
november
and
the
february
thus
the
bishop
continually
engrossed
with
geneva
thought
of
nothing
but
recovering
his
former
power
but
the
independence
of
that
city
had
enemies
more
formidable
still
charles
had
ordered
the
genevans
to
drive
the
reformation
from
their
walls
of
anxiety
for
your
health
he
wrote
to
them
learning
that
certain
new
opinions
and
sects
are
beginning
to
swarm
among
you
we
exhort
you
seriously
not
to
admit
them
to
extirpate
them
and
to
set
about
it
with
the
utmost
diligence
not
to
permit
anything
to
be
taught
among
you
in
the
leastwise
opposed
to
the
decrees
and
traditions
of
your
ancestors
on
the
contrary
to
preserve
with
unshaken
constancy
the
faith
rites
and
ceremonies
that
you
have
received
from
your
fathers
you
will
thus
receive
a
worthy
reward
from
almighty
god
and
will
merit
from
us
every
sort
of
gratitude
geneva
had
not
obeyed
the
orders
of
the
puissant
emperor
the
affairs
of
germany
had
at
first
prevented
him
from
constraining
the
little
city
to
follow
his
sovereign
orders
which
even
the
barbarous
tribes
of
the
new
world
obeyed
but
now
the
treaty
of
nuremberg
was
signed
charles
having
come
to
terms
with
the
protestants
of
germany
might
easily
keep

promise
he
had
made
to
his
through

assist
him

the
huguenots

sidenote
freedom
in
sight
the
perfidious
murderer
of
levrier
was
beginning
to
hope
that
it
would
be
possible
to
found
a
stronghold
in
geneva
with
its
ditches
and
lofty
walls
flanked
with
towers
and
bastions
and
a
strong
garrison
of
halberdiers
arquebusiers
and
artillerymen
who
would
keep
the
city
and
country
in
complete
subjection
under
the
yoke
of
their
master
when
gessler
was
sent
in
the
name
of
austria
to
destroy
the
liberties
of
the
swiss
did
he
not
build
a
fortress
above
the
yoke
of
uri
and
had
not
the
free
children
of
those
mountains
to
atone
for
the
smallest
sparks
of
independence
by
long
and
costly
imprisonment
in
gloomy
dungeons
had
not
pharaoh
set
the
example
in
egypt
why
should
not
they
do
the
same
to
subdue
the
huguenots
fortresses
cannons
arquebusses

this
was
what
geneva
had
to
expect
before
any
great
length
of
time
the
genevans
were
really
to
see
a
formidable
force
marching
against
them
commissioned
to
carry
out
the
plans
of
the
emperor
and
the
duke

always

october
on
one
fine
autumn
day
october
farel
and
saunier
finished
their
journey
through
piedmont
reached
that
beautiful
neighbourhood
where
the
alps
and
the
jura
drawing
near
each
other
form
a
rich
valley
in
the
midst
of
which
calmly
sleep
the
pure
waters
of
an
azure
lake
they
soon
distinguished
the
three
old
towers
of
the
cathedral
of
geneva
rising
high
above
the
houses
they
pressed
their
horses
whose
speed
was
relaxed
through
fatigue
and
entered
the
city
of
the
huguenots
they
had
been
directed
to
the
tour
percée
which
they
found
in
a
street
situated
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhone
and
bearing
its
name
they
stopped
in
front
of
the
inn
dismounted
from
their
horses
spoke
to
the
landlord
and
took
up
their
quarters
under
his
roof
sidenote
farel
consults
with
olivetan
one
of
their
first
thoughts
after
resting
themselves
was
to
inform
robert
olivetan
of
their
arrival
calvin
cousin
who
was
still
tutor
to
jean
chautemps
children
hastened
to
them
delighted
at
the
coming
of
his
brethren
farel
desired
to
consult
with
him
on
the
best
means
of
advancing
the
knowledge
of
the
gospel
in
geneva
but
another
idea
had
also
occupied
him
during
his
journey
knowing
how
learned
olivetan
was
in
greek
and
hebrew
he
had
cast
his
eyes
on
him
to
make
the
translation
of
the
bible
which
the
waldensian
synod
had
decided
upon
farel
having
spoken
to
him
about
it
olivetan
exclaimed
in
alarm
can
not
accept
such
a
commission
considering
the
great
difficulty
of
the
work
and
my
own
weakness
farel
did
not
admit
the
excuse
and
continued
to
solicit
his
friend
who
would
not
give
way
could
do
this
work
much
better
yourself
he
said
to
the
travellers
but
farel
believed
that
god
gives
every
man
a
calling
for
which
he
has
prepared
him
and
that
olivetan
was
a
scholar
while
he
was
an
evangelist
has
not
given
me
leisure
said
farel
calls
me
to
another
work
he
wills
me
to
sow
the
pure
seed
of
the
word
in
his
field
and
water
it
and
make
it
flourish
like
the
garden
of
eden
he
dropped
the
subject
however
in
order
to
talk
with
olivetan
about
the
evangelisation
of
geneva
chautemps
tutor
who
had
so
often
sunk
under
the
weight
of
his
task
and
so
earnestly
called
for
a
stronger
hand
looked
upon
farel
as
one
sent
from
heaven
but
how
to
begin
the
evangelist
of
orbe
took
from
his
pocket
the
letters
given
him
at
berne
for
some
of
the
chief
huguenots
olivetan
saw
that
a
door
was
opening
for
the
gospel
and
without
loss
of
time
the
two
friends
went
out
to
deliver
the
letters
to
their
addresses
olivetan
gave
farel
the
information
he
required
and
explained
to
him
that
although
some
of
those
to
whom
he
was
introduced
inclined
to
the
side
of
the
gospel
the
majority
were
content
to
throw
off
the
romish
superstitions
and
were
simply
true
patriots
the
huguenots
having
opened
the
letters
that
farel
presented
found
that
the
bearer
was
william
farel
preacher
of
the
gospel
and
that
their
bernese
friends
invited
them
to
hear
him
speak
this
was
great
news
no
name
was
better
known
than
farel
in
the
districts
bathed
by
the
lakes
of
geneva
morat
bienne
and
neuchatel
the
huguenots
delighted
to
see
him
looked
attentively
at
him
and
some
of
them
reflected
on
such
an
unexpected
incident
which
religious
and
political
motives
rendered
most
important
in
their
eyes
friends
of
the
reformation
had
often
told
them
that
the
independence
of
geneva
would
never
be
secure
until
the
dominion
of
the
bishop
and
the
pope
had
given
place
to
that
of
the
gospel
and
now
the
gospel
was
knocking
at
their
doors
in
the
person
of
farel
was
it
not
he
who
had
filled
aigle
morat
neuchatel
valengin
orbe
and
grandson
with
the
evangelical
doctrine
political
men
hoped
that
at
his
voice
the
temporal
dominion
of
the
church
would
fall
and
the
phantoms
of
the
middle
ages
which
still
entangled
liberty
would
flee
away
in
alarm
to
distant
religious
men
who
had
found
pleasure
in
the
words
of
am
thun
of
olivetan
and
of
the
gospel
more
especially
expected
that
this
great
preacher
would
make
the
light
of
heaven
to
shine
in
their
hearts
all
therefore
expressed
themselves
ready
to
hear
him
and
farel
saying
he
should
be
happy
to
see
them
at
his
inn
took
his
leave
sidenote
huguenots
go
to
hear
farel
the
news
of
the

him
said

syndic
and
ambassador
of

republic
at

showed
much
zeal
for
the
reformation
at
first
but
afterwards
incurred
severe
reproach
these
citizens
who
were
the
of
geneva
with
several
other
persons
of
less
distinction
arrived
at
the
reformers
lodgings
the
landlord
of
the
tour
perce
introduced
them
into
a
private
room
where
they
found
farel
and
saunier
the
conversation
began
sidenote
he
shows
them
their
deficiencies
the
two
evangelists
were
full
of
esteem
for
the
men
who
were
struggling
with
such
courage
for
independence
and
liberty
against
powerful
enemies
they
were
not
slow
however
to
observe
that
if
in
a
political
light
they
held
the
most
elevated
sentiments
there
were
great
deficiencies
in
them
in
a
religious
light
the
huguenots
wanted
neither
pope
nor
priests
but
it
was
because
of
the
tyranny
of
the
one
and
the
licentious
conduct
of
the
others
as
for
the
true
doctrine
of
the
gospel
and
the
necessity
of
a
moral
transformation
in
themselves
they
had
not
troubled
themselves
about
it
there
was
also
a
great
void
in
their
religious
system
before
they
could
become
good
protestants
and
men
morally
strong
friends
at
once
of
order
and
liberty
this
blank
must
be
filled
up
they
felt
it
themselves
and
told
farel
they
desired
nothing
better
than
to
be
instructed
the
landlord
brought
in
a
few
benches
and
stools
for
them
and
then
farel
having
saunier
near
him
took
his
station
before
a
little
table
he
placed
a
bible
on
it
and
began
to
speak
from
the
word
of
god
an
audience
so
select
an
opportunity
so
important
for
announcing
the
gospel
had
perhaps
never
been
offered
to
the
reformer
he
had
before
him
the
earliest
champions
of
modern
liberty
these
men
had
recognised
the
errors
in
the
state
he
must
now
show
them
the
errors
in
the
church
they
must
learn
that
if
man
may
throw
off
despotism
in
earthly
things
it
is
more
lawful
still
to
throw
it
off
in
heavenly
things
farel
undertook
the
task
he
showed
the
huguenots
from
scripture
they
had
been
abused
until
now
by
their
priests
that
the
latter
amused
them
with
silly
tales
that
had
no
substance
in
them
and
further
that
these
cheats
allured
them
if
they
felt
it
necessary
by
flattery
and
gave
the
rein
to
their
lusts
he
added
that
neither
councils
nor
popes
would
teach
them
to
know
jesus
christ
but
holy
scripture
only
and
urged
them
to
abandon
errors
and
abuses
whose
danger
and
absurdity
he
forcibly
pointed
out
to
them
the
huguenots
listened
to
him
attentively
had
no
great
sentiment
or
knowledge
or
fear
of
god
but
they
already
aspired
to
the
religion
that
had
been
adopted
at
berne
says
a
manuscript
of
the
seventeenth
century
god
seeing
his
people
of
geneva
stagnating
in
security
and
wishing
by
an
effort
of
his
mercy
to
show
them
the
divine
sweetness
of
his
clemency
animated
the
courage
of
his
servants
farel
and
saunier
the
simple
movement
by
which
farel
setting
aside
all

the
faith
that
he
preached
specially
struck
his
hearers
they
rose
thanked
him
and
left
the
room
saying
as
they
retired
that
it
seemed
right
to
substitute
the
holy
scriptures
for
the
teaching
of
the
pope
this
was
the
principle
of
an
immense
transformation
the
reformation
had
taken
its
first
step
in
geneva
when
the
placards
of
the
pardon
of
god
had
been
stuck
up
it
now
took
the
second
step
was
a
great
sensation
in
the
city
said
froment
some
of
the
hearers
returning
to
their
families
or
their
friends
astonished
them
by
saying
that
henceforth
their
master
should
be
neither
la
baume
nor
medicis
or
even
peter
the
lord
jesus
christ
alone
the
astonishment
was
still
greater
in
the
political
and
ecclesiastical
bodies
hitherto
they
had
only
had
to
deal
with
the
heroes
of
liberal
emancipation
now
they
were
in
presence
of
the
champions
of
the
religious
movement
thing
having
come
to
the
notice
of
the
council
canons
and
priests
of
the
city
they
were
suddenly
troubled
and
disturbed
the
monks
were
either
astounded
or
very
angry
while
the
nuns
of
claire
were
quite
alarmed
at
wretched
preacher
who
was
beginning
to
speak
secretly
at
his
quarters
in
a
room
seeking
to
infect
the
people
with
his
heresy
all
of
them
foresaw
that
this
act
would
have
innumerable
and
fatal
consequences
sidenote
farel
second
lecture
there
was
soon
a
second
meeting
many
of
those
who
had
not
been
at
the
first
wished
to
be
present
at
this
and
from
the
city
the
molard
and
the
rhone
bridge
many
citizens
took
their
way
towards
the
tour
perce
there
were
no
women
among
them
but
the
men
filled
every
corner
of
the
room
anxious
to
hear
the
gospel
as
farel
on
the
former
occasion
had
spoken
particularly
of
scripture
he
now
addressed
the
huguenots
on
the
subject
of
living
grace
he
showed
them
that
it
was
not
the
pardon
of
the
church
but
the
pardon
of
god
that
saves
those
prelates
and
masters
who
puffed
out
with
magnificent
titles
were
continually
recommending
pious
works
were
he
said
building
the
temple
of
god
with
straw
and
stubble
instead
of
bringing
together
the
living
stones
of
which
scripture
speaks
he
maintained
that
when
the
priests
spoke
so
much
of
penance
vows
masses
fasts
aves
macerations
flagellations
indulgences
pilgrimages
invocations
to
the
virgin
and
the
saints
they
hardly
left
jesus
christ
the
hundredth
part
of
the
work
of
redemption
farel
and
saunier
repeated
strongly
that
pardon
resides
wholly
in
the
saviour
and
not
in
part
only
which
those
who
heard
him
took
great
pleasure
some
meditated
as
they
went
away
on
what
they
had
heard
and
that
silent
conversation
of
the
soul
speaking
with
its
god
began
in
the
quiet
chamber
of
many
a
house
this
means
a
goodly
number
of
genevans
received
a
knowledge
of
the
gospel
some
of
de
la
and
claude
salomon
amongst
besought
farel
to
come
and
explain
the
scriptures
in
their
own
houses
this
second
meeting
added
considerably
to
the
alarm
in
the
catholic
camp
and
the
commotion
was
particularly
great
among
the
women
who
were
at
that
time
the
main
support
of
the
papacy
in
geneva
is
not
one
of
them
said
a
reformer
has
any
desire
to
learn
the
truth
so
tainted
are
they
with
the
breath
teaching
life
and
conversation
of
their
priests
there
is
a
great
intimacy
between
them
some
are
their
brothers
others
their
friends
neighbours
gossips
i
shall
say
nothing
more
at
present
he
added
save
the
honour
of
the
ladies
the
priests
told
their
female
parishioners
that
if
they
did
not
turn
out
these
unbelievers
everything
was
lost
the
genevan
ladies
therefore
entreated
their
husbands
and
brothers
to
expel
the
heretic
preachers
a
few
citizens
who
cared
very
little
about
the
reformation
were
carried
away
by
their
wives
and
proceeding
angry
and
heated
to
the
tour
perce
desired
farel
and
saunier
to
leave
geneva
at
once
if
they
did
not
wish
to
be
turned
out
forcibly
we
can
not
maintain
what
we
say
replied
the
reformers
offer
ourselves
to
death
having
god
for
the
author
of
their
faith
they
were
tranquil
in
the
midst
of
tempests
thus
despite
all
the
efforts
of
the
husbands
urged
by
their
wives
and
of
the
wives
urged
by
the
priests
farel
remained
at
that
time
a
great
agitation
prevailed
in
geneva
canons
rectors
monks
and
curates
ran
up
and
down
talking
with
one
another
holding
counsel
together
asked
what
they
should
do
with
those
persons
sidenote
farel
before
the
the
magistrates
noticing
the
commotion
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
farel
and
saunier
in
the
city
summoned
them
to
appear
before
the
bench
and
met
to
consult
as
to
what
should
be
said
and
done
to
them
the
council
had
not
made
up
their
minds
either
for
or
against
the
reformation
and
many
of
the
members
arrived
at
the
not
knowing
clearly
what
they
ought
to
do
balard
who
was
then
discharging
the
functions
of
vidame
a
zealous
catholic
whom
froment
calls
probably
with
some
exaggeration
head
servant
of
the
priests
was
for
immediate
repression
and
a
few
were
ready
to
vote
with
him
the
majority
composed
of
men
of
moderate
views
had
no
desire
to
offend
the
canons
and
priests
but
feared
still
more
to
offend
berne
william
hugues
the
premier
syndic
and
besançon
brother
was
rather
favourable
to
the
reformers
only
a
small
number
of
decided
huguenots
were
convinced
that
the
new
doctrine
alone
could
free
them
from
the
bickerings
of
the
bishops
and
the
dukes
farel
and
saunier
were
conducted
to
the
and
taken
into
the
council
chamber
as
they
entered
everybody
looked
with
curious
eye
on
that
man
with
keen
look
and
red
beard
who
was
setting
all
the
country
in
a
blaze
from
the
alps
to
the
jura
one
of
the
magistrates
most
devoted
to
the
church
addressing
farel
rudely
said
is
you
then
that
do
nothing
but
disturb
the
world
it
is
your
tongue
that
is
stirring
up
tumult
everywhere
and
trumpeting
rebellion
you
are
a
busybody
who
have
come
here
only
to
create
discord
we
order
you
to
depart
from
the
city
instantly
the
angry
looks
of
some
of
the
councillors
were
at
the
same
time
turned
upon
farel
who
being
regarded
as
the
scourge
of
the
priests
for
that
reason
supremely
hated
by
them
the
reformer
contained
himself
and
answered
am
not
a
deluder
i
am
not
a
trumpet
of
sedition
i
simply
proclaim
the
truth
i
am
ready
to
prove
out
of
god
word
that
my
doctrine
is
true
and
added
he
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
only
to
sacrifice
my
ease
but
to
shed
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
for
it
the
reformer
noble
simplicity
touched
the
members
of
the
council
and
supplied
the
huguenots
with
sufficient
motives
to
undertake
his
defence
farel
judges
appeared
to
be
softened
by
his
moderation
then
calling
to
mind
that
paul
under
similar
circumstances
had
invoked
the
respected
name
of
imperial
rome
the
evangelist
resolved
to
follow
his
example
honoured
lords
he
said
you
not
allies
and
of
berne
know
then
that
my
lords
of
berne
who
have
at
heart
to
advance
the
gospel
have
given
me
letters
wherein
they
bear
witness
to
my
innocence
and
doctrine
and
beg
you
to
hear
me
preach
peacefully
assuring
you
that
by
so
doing
you
will
confer
a
pleasure
on
them
at
the
same
time
farel
produced
the
credentials
with
which
their
excellencies
had
furnished
him
the
syndics
took
the
letter
you
condemn
me
unheard
continued
farel
insult
god
and
also
as
you
see
my
lords
of
berne
the
latter
plea
touched
the
magistrates
of
geneva
closely
and
accordingly
changing
countenance
they
gently
dismissed
farel
and
saunier
without
imposing
any
punishment
on
them
but
begging
them
only
not
to
disturb
the
public
tranquillity
by
new
doctrines
the
two
ministers
quitted
the
council
chamber
sidenote
deliberations
of
the
clergy
meanwhile
an
episcopal
council
was
being
held
and
jurists
canons
and
priests
were
assembling
at
the
house
of
the
grand
vicar
monseigneur
de
gingins
abbot
of
bonmont
deliberated
as
to
what
should
be
done
the
reformation
and
the
reformers
of
whom
there
had
been
so
much
talk
these
fifteen
years
were
in
geneva
at
last
the
rock
so
long
suspended
over
their
heads
was
at
length
detached
from
the
mountain
and
threatened
to
destroy
everything
what
was
to
be
done
the
tumult
was
still
greater
in
the
city
than
in
the
grand
vicar
house
a
crowd
attracted
by
the
summons
of
farel
and
saunier
before
the
council
scattered
up
and
down
the
streets
and
priests
paraded
the
city
arms
under
their
frocks
the
reformers
had
some
trouble
to
reach
their
lodgings
the
episcopal
council
prolonged
its
sittings
monseigneur
de
bonmont
a
sincere
but
moderate
and
liberal
catholic
was
ill
at
ease
seeing
angry
faces
and
flashing
eyes
around
him
he
represented
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
proceed
cautiously
and
in
accordance
with
justice
some
of
those
present
were
exasperated
for
in
their
eyes
de
gingins
moderation
was
flagrant
treason
in
their
opinion
it
was
necessary
to
prosecute
immediately
not
only
the
foreign
preachers
but
who
inviting
them
into
their
houses
as
for
instance
to
converse
about
the
gospel
wished
to
live
differently
from
what
their
forefathers
pastors
and
bishops
had
taught
them
the
most
reverend
vicar
represented
that
persons
were
not
convicted
without
being
heard
that
they
must
summon
these
strangers
before
them
call
upon
them
to
explain
their
doctrine
and
then
they
would
be
sentenced
upon
full
knowledge
of
the
facts
this
alarmed
the
council
and
dom
stephen
piard
proctor
to
the
chapter
exclaimed
with
a
frown
we
dispute
all
our
office
is
at
an
end
he
urged
that
discuss
theological
questions
was
to
overlook
the
authority
of
the
church
that
we
must
believe
because
rome
has
spoken
that
these
people
with
their
bibles
were
subtle
spirits
and
dangerous
adversaries
and
that
the
authority
of
the
chapter
would
be
overthrown
if
they
permitted
any
disputation
sidenote
conspiracy
against
farel
dom
stephen
enjoyed
a
certain
authority
the
assembly
was
about
to
refuse
to
hear
farel
when
it
was
opposed
by
some
of
the
members
who
were
most
notorious
for
their
fanatical
zeal
in
the
sixteenth
century
not
only
jurists
regarded
it
as
a
duty
to
condemn
heretics
to
death
but
devout
persons
laymen
as
well
as
priests
thought
they
did
an
acceptable
thing
to
god
by
putting
them
to
death
it
would
appear
that
these
latter
persons
had
made
up
their
minds
to
this
meritorious
work
deliberated
to
kill
farel
and
his
companion
says
a
manuscript
found
the
best
means
of
getting
them
to
come
would
be
by
giving
them
to
understand
that
they
desired
to
debate
with
them
the
pious
sister
jeanne
de
jussie
corroborates
this
statement
the
conspirators
carried
the
proposal
to
summon
farel
he
was
never
to
go
out
again
from
the
house
but
first
of
all
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
enter
it
machard
the
bishop
secretary
was
deputed
to
summon
farel
and
saunier
and
also
olivetan
retract
publicly
or
to
explain
before
the
episcopal
council
what
they
had
preached
in
the
inn
ere
long
something
transpired
of
the
plot
of
these
fanatical
ecclesiastics
and
the
huguenots
forming
part
of
the
little
council
at
that
moment
assembled
in
the
represented
to
their
colleagues
that
the
priests
had
no
other
object
than
to
draw
the
ministers
into
a
trap
accordingly
the
two
chief
magistrates
hugues
and
balard
accompanied
machard
to
the
tour
perce
to
give
a
guarantee
to
farel
and
his
friends
some
persons
suspected
balard
of
wishing
to
get
farel
and
saunier
into
trouble
is
nothing
more
prejudicial
to
geneva
than
division
he
said
wish
those
who
disturb
us
were
well
out
of
us
but
he
was
neither
a
coward
nor
a
traitor
he
was
determined
to
send
the
reformers
away
from
geneva
but
to
protect
their
lives
on
reaching
the
inn
the
bishop
secretary
informed
the
evangelists
that
the
episcopal
council
invited
them
to
retract
the
doctrines
they
had
taught
the
presence
of
balard
and
hugues
giving
weight
to
the
request
farel
answered
affirm
these
doctrines
in
the
strongest
way
possible
and
again
offer
to
die
if
we
can
not
prove
them
out
of
scripture
that
case
resumed
machard
before
the
episcopal

discuss
with
the

veigy
opinion
it
was
necessary
for
the
preacher
to
be
sent
by
some
romish
ecclesiastical
authority
farel
replied
with
simplicity
am
sent
by
god
and
i
am
come
to
announce
his
word
wretch
exclaimed
the
priests
as
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
the
official
resumed
has
sent
you
you
say
how
is
that
can
you
show
by
any
manifest
sign
that
you
are
come
in
his
name
as
moses
before
pharaoh
will
you
prove
to
us
by
miracles
that
you
really
come
from
god
if
you
can
not
then
show
us
the
licence
of
our
most
reverend
prelate
the
bishop
of
geneva
preacher
never
yet
preached
in
his
diocese
without
his
leave
here
the
official
paused
and
then
disdainfully
scanning
the
reformer
from
head
to
foot
he
said
do
not
wear
the
dress
that
is
usual
for
those
who
are
accustomed
to
announce
the
word
of
god
to
us
you
are
dressed
like
a
soldier
or
a
brigand
how
is
it
you
are
so
bold
as
to
preach
is
it
not
forbidden
by
a
decree
of
holy
church
for
laymen
to
preach
in
public
under
pain
of
excommunication
that
is
contained
in
the
decretals
of
our
holy
mother
church
you
are
therefore
a
deceiver
and
a
bad
man
farel
believed
that
it
was
his
duty
to
announce
the
word
of
god
because
jesus
christ
had
said
the
gospel
to
every
he
thought
that
the
true
successors
of
the
apostles
were
those
who
conformed
to
christ
order
and
that
as
calvin
says
pope
of
rome
and
all
his
tribe
had
no
claim
to
that
apostolical
succession
which
they
alleged
since
they
no
longer
cared
for
the
doctrine
of
christ
the
clergy
in
whose
presence
he
was
standing
did
not
allow
him
time
to
speak
at
last
they
had
before
them
the
terrible
heretic
of
whom
they
had
been
talking
so
many
years
the
official
words
had
still
further
aroused
their
passions
they
could
no
longer
contain
themselves
pale
with
anger
they
shuddered
and
clattered
with
their
feet
as
they
sat
at
last
the
mine
exploded
they
all
spoke
at
once
pouring
insult
and
abuse
on
the
reformer
their
excitement
carried
them
away
they
rose
from
their
seats
rushed
upon
him
and
pulling
him
now
this
way
now
that
exclaimed
farel
you
wicked
devil
what
business
have
you
to
go
up
and
down
disturbing
all
the
world
are
you
baptized
where
were
you
born
where
do
you
come
from
why
did
you
come
here
tell
us
by
whose
authority
you
preach
are
you
not
the
man
who
propagated
luther
heresies
at
aigle
and
neuchatel
and
threw
the
whole
country
into
confusion
who
sent
you
into
this
city
the
noise
and
tumult
would
not
permit
either
farel
or
the
grand
vicar
to
speak
the
weapons
were
heard
to
rattle
which
some
of
the
priests
carried
under
their
frocks
farel
remained
still
and
silent
in
the
midst
of
this
raging
sea
at
last
messire
de
bonmont
succeeded
in
interposing
his
authority
made
his
colleagues
resume
their
seats
and
silence
was
restored
then
the
reformer
nobly
lifting
up
his
head
said
with
great
simplicity
lords
i
am
not
a
devil
i
was
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
and
if
i
journey
to
and
fro
it
is
that
i
may
preach
jesus
christ
crucified
dead
for
our
sins
and
risen
again
for
our
justification
so
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
shall
have
everlasting
life
as
an
ambassador
of
jesus
christ
i
am
compelled
to
teach
him
to
all
who
are
willing
to
hear
me
i
have
however
no
other
right
to
speak
than
that
which
the
commandment
of
god
gives
to
me
his
servant
my
only
aim
is
so
to
discharge
my
duty
that
all
the
world
may
receive
salvation
and
it
is
for
this
cause
and
for
no
other
that
i
am
come
into
this
city
having
been
brought
before
you
to
give
an
account
of
my
faith
i
am
ready
to
do
so
not
only
at
this
moment
but
as
many
times
as
you
please
to
hear
me
peaceably
what
i
have
preached
and
still
preach
is
the
pure
truth
and
not
a
heresy
and
i
will
maintain
it
even
unto
death
as
for
what
you
say
about
my
disturbing
the
land
and
this
city
in
particular
i
will
answer
as
elijah
did
to
ahab
have
not
troubled
israel
but
thou
and
thy
yes
it
is
you
and
yours
who
trouble
the
world
by
your
traditions
your
human
inventions
and
your
dissolute
lives
sidenote
threats
against
farel
the
priests
astonished
at
the
calm
simple
free
and
spirited
language
of
the
reformer
had
listened
to
him
in
silence
so
far
but
the
moment
they
heard
him
speak
of
their
human
inventions
and
irregular
lives
his
words
were
like
daggers
and
disturbed
their
wicked
consciences
it
might
have
been
said
that
the
infernal
deities
it
is
the
expression
of
a
reformer
were
hovering
about
them
and
left
them
no
repose
fixed
their
burning
eyes
on
farel
they
gnashed
their
teeth
says
a
manuscript
and
one
of
them
starting
up
in
a
passion
said
non
amplius
indigemus
testibus
reus
est
mortis
this
was
the
signal
for
a
scene
more
savage
than
the
former
all
rose
again
some
impelled
by
violence
and
pride
others
believing
they
were
supporting
the
cause
of
religion
and
exclaimed
the
rhone
to
the
rhone
kill
him
kill
him
it
is
better
for
this
rascally
lutheran
to
die
than
permit
him
to
trouble
all
the
people
these
words
without
being
those
which
the
uttered
against
christ
were
very
like
them
farel
was
struck
by
the
resemblance
the
words
of
god
and
not
of
caiaphas
he
exclaimed
at
these
words
the
exasperated
priests
could
contain
themselves
no
longer
they
all
started
up
together
and
shouted
out
him
kill
the
lutheran
hound
dom
bergeri
proctor
to
the
chapter
still
more
excited
than
the
others
urged
them
on
exclaiming
in
his
savoyard
dialect
tapa
which
adds
froment
means
strike
the
sentence
was
immediately
carried
into
execution
they
surrounded
the
three
reformers
some
caught
hold
of
farel
others
of
saunier
and
others
of
olivetan
they
abused
them
beat
them
spat
in
their
faces
and
uttered
all
sorts
of
cries
so
that
it
was
like
a
pandemonium
in
the
midst
of
all
this
uproar
farel
and
his
companions
their
patience
and
moderation
the
abbot
of
bonmont
syndics
hugues
and
balard
and
even
a
few
priests
ashamed
of
such
a
scene
tried
to
put
an
end
to
it
is
not
well
done
said
the
abbot
we
not
pledged
our
word
and
honour
to
them
syndic
hugues
a
just
quick
and
energetic
man
disgusted
with
the
behaviour
of
the
ecclesiastics
broke
out
at
last
are
wicked
men
he
said
brought
you
these
men
on
your
promise
that
no
harm
should
be
done
them
and
you
want
to
beat
and
kill
them
before
our
faces
i
will
go
and
set
the
great
bell
ringing
to
convoke
the
general
council
the
assembled
people
shall
decide
hugues
was
leaving
the
room
to
go
and
put
his
threat
into
execution
when
balard
the
other
magistrate
desiring
to
prevent
anything
that
might
compromise
the
cause
of
rome
endeavoured
to
calm
him
however
the
syndic
threat
had
produced
its
effect
the
priests
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
a
general
assembly
of
the
citizens
and
fearing
lest
it
should
decree
their
expulsion
from
geneva
returned
to
their
seats
rather
ashamed
of
themselves
the
abbot
taking
advantage
of
this
new
lull
desired
farel
and
his
friends
to
withdraw
in
order
that
the
episcopal
council
might
deliberate
farel
left
the
room
covered
with
spittle
and
severely
bruised
sidenote
farel
assaulted
while
the
superior
clergy
were
behaving
in
this
way
the
inferior
clergy
were
assembling
and
about
eighty
priests
had
collected
before
the
house
of
the
well
armed
with
clubs
to
defend
the
holy
catholic
faith
and
prepared
to
die
for
it
this
mode
of
defending
religion
so
different
from
that
of
the
first
fathers
of
the
church
has
been
made
known
to
us
through
the
reverend
sister
jeanne
de
jussie
the
priests
were
stout
resolute
men
they
had
formed
a
plot
and
were
there
to
carry
it
into
execution
wished
adds
sister
jeanne
put
that
wretch
and
his
accomplices
to
a
bitter
death
such
was
the
exploit
they
contemplated
and
for
its
accomplishment
they
carefully
surrounded
the
house
they
filled
the
narrow
area
of
the
puits
pierre
and
the
rue
des
chanoines
and
had
even
penetrated
into
de
bonmont
courtyard
and
garden
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
farel
to
escape
the
fanatical
and
agitated
crowd
which
had
been
there
for
some
time
was
beginning
to
grow
impatient
that
the
episcopal
council
sat
so
long
farel
and
his
two
friends
when
they
had
turned
into
a
long
gallery
could
hear
the
raised
voices
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
council
and
the
increasing
noise
of
the
crowd
that
filled
the
courtyard
but
another
danger
threatened
them
one
of
the
servants
francis
olard
surnamed
ginin
a
violent
man
stood
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
having
been
posted
there
arquebus
in
hand
as
a
sentinel
he
had
listened
to
the
tumult
from
within
the
shouting
from
without
excited
and
inflamed
him
was
not
this
farel
the
enemy
of
his
heretic
whom
everybody
wished
dead
his
weapon
was
ready
he
levelled
it
at
farel
and
prepared
to
fire
had
the
priests
stationed
olard
there
for
this
purpose
as
the
chronicles
say
or
did
he
act
of
his
own
accord
being
more
fanatical
than
his
masters
as
the
servants
of
political
or
ecclesiastical
corporations
often
are
be
it
as
it
may
the
arquebusier
pulled
the
trigger
the
priming
flashed
but
the
gun
did
not
go
off
farel
turning
to
him
said
coldly
am
not
to
be
shaken
by
a
popgun
your
toy
does
not
alarm
me
said
his
friends
of
his
mercy
turned
aside
the
blow
in
order
to
preserve
farel
for
struggles
still
more
formidable
sidenote
danger
of
farel
and
his
friends
meanwhile
the
council
were
still
deliberating
and
many
wished
farel
to
be
put
to
death
heresy
in
that
age
as
is
but
too
well
known
was
punished
capitally
but
the
magistrates
pointed
to
the
danger
of
using
violence
towards
the
preacher
of
the
lords
of
berne
their
opinion
prevailed
and
the
reformers
having
been
brought
into
the
room
again
the
said
farel
leave
my
presence
and
this
house
and
within
six
hours
get
you
gone
from
the
city
with
your
two
companions
under
pain
of
the
stake
and
know
that
if
the
sentence
is
not
more
severe
you
must
ascribe
it
to
our
kindness
and
to
our
respect
for
my
lords
of
berne
condemn
us
unheard
said
farel
demand
a
certificate
to
show
at
berne
that
i
have
done
my
duty
shall
not
have
one
the
abbot
hastily
replied
the
room
all
of
you
without
a
word
more
the
priests
and
people
collected
in
front
of
the
house
learning
that
farel
was
about
to
appear
crowded
one
upon
another
uttering
angry
cries
it
would
seem
that
the
reformer
heard
them
and
stopped
an
instant
knowing
full
well
what
was
in
reserve
for
him
it
was
in
truth
a
solemn
moment
perhaps
his
last
caitiff
dared
not
come
out
said
sister
jeanne
afterwards
abbess
of
annecy
he
had
heard
the
noise
made
by
the
church
people
before
the
door
and
feared
they
would
put
him
to
death
seeing
that
farel
hesitated
two
of
the
senior
canons
addressed
him
coarsely
you
will
not
go
out
willingly
and
in
name
they
said
out
in
the
name
of
all
the
devils
whose
minister
and
servant
you
are
thus
spoke
a
few
fanatical
priests
their
god
was
the
church
and
there
was
no
salvation
for
the
sinner
except
in
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
in
them
imagination
took
the
place
of
understanding
and
passion
of
judgment
they
had
no
idea
of
the
living
faith
which
animated
the
hearts
of
farel
and
his
friends
and
looked
upon
them
as
impious
putting
aside
the
holy
authority
and
wise
precepts
of
scripture
they
had
no
other
rule
than
strong
attachment
to
their
church
and
the
excess
of
zeal
which
carried
them
away
inflamed
by
violent
passion
they
did
not
confine
themselves
to
abuse
the
sister
of
claire
is
far
from
wishing
to
conceal
their
exploits
of
them
she
says
him
a
hard
kick
the
other
struck
him
heavily
on
the
head
and
face
and
in
great
confusion
they
put
him
out
with
his
two
companions

and
olivetan
quitted
the
house
and
thus
escaped
the
of
those
reverend
gentlemen
but
turned
out
of
doors
by
the
canons
they
fell
from
scylla
into
charybdis
they
had
to
experience
still
more
culpable
excesses
of
religious
fanaticism
the
priests
chaplains
sacristans
and
the
furious
populace
assembled
in
the
street
hooted
hissed
groaned
and
howled
some
threateningly
flourished
their
weapons
it
was
like
an
impetuous
hurricane
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
sweep
everything
before
it
it
was
a
human
tempest
more
terrible
perhaps
than
that

on
a
sudden
there
was
a
movement
in
the
crowd
those
who
were
on
the
outside
falling
back
in
alarm
upon
their
comrades
there
was
a
body
of
armed
men
approaching
at
this
time
up
came
the
syndics
and
all
the
watch
with
their
halberds
sir
priests
said
they
nothing
rash
the
mob
gave
way
are
come
to
execute
justice
added
the
magistrates
upon
this
they
took
caitiff
placed
him
and
his
companions
in
the
midst
of
the
guard
and
all
marched
off
in
the
direction
of
the
tour
perce
the
crowd
parting
right
and
left
to
make
way
for
the
escort
the
priests
fourscore
in
number
kept
together
forming
a
dark
and
agitated
group
and
so
stationed
themselves
that
the
three
ministers
must
necessarily
pass
before
them
on
their
road
to
the
inn
they
had
heard
that
farel
and
his
friends
were
to
be
expelled
from
the
city
the
worthy
men
could
not
be
satisfied
with
this
says
sister
jeanne
considering
that
the
syndics
and
even
the
episcopal
council
refused
to
do
justice
to
them
they
were
resolved
to
take
the
matter
into
their
own
hands
just
as
the
three
preachers
were
passing
in
front
of
them
one
of
them
rushed
forward
sword
in
hand
upon
farel
run
him
through
one
of
the
syndics
who
was
at
the
reformer
side
saw
him
caught
the
assassin
by
the
arm
and
stopped
him
this
act
of
the
magistrate
seriously
grieved
the
devout
laymen
who
prevented
the
clergy
from
killing
their
adversaries
were
looked
upon
as
impious
were
chagrined
says
the
good
nun
innocently
the
blow
failed
the
halberdiers
closed
their
ranks
thrust
the
priests
and
their
creatures
aside
and
the
reformers
continued
on
their
way
the
mob
finding
they
could
not
touch
the
lutherans
compensated
themselves
with
hooting
in
every
street
through
which
they
passed
men
and
women
cried
out
that
they
ought
to
be
flung
into
the
rhone
at
length
the
procession
reached
the
tour
perce
the
reformers
entered
and
the
syndics
left
a
guard
sidenote
farel
departure
they
must
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
farel
and
his
friends
might
have
been
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
and
have
fainted
in
the
midst
of
their
work
but
their
heavenly
master
had
said
they
persecute
you
in
this
city
flee
ye
into
matth
x
what
grieved
them
was
the
thought
of
the
generous
men
who
had
listened
to
them
these
farel
was
determined
not
to
abandon
if
the
tempest
obliged
him
to
depart
he
would
take
advantage
of
the
first
moment
of
calm
weather
to
introduce
into
geneva
that
gospel
which
many
huguenots
desired
with
all
their
heart
the
next
day
october
a
few
citizens
friends
of
the
reformer
rose
early
got
ready
a
boat
near
the
molard
and
went
to
the
tour
perce
to
fetch
the
missionaries
hoping
that
if
the
latter
set
off
betimes
they
would
not
be
observed
but
the
was
quite
as
matutinal
as
they
were
some
of
them
were
already
before
the
door
and
it
is
probable
they
had
been
there
all
night
for
fear
the
huguenots
should
take
advantage
of
the
darkness
to
get
the
ministers
away

up
they
gave
the
signal
a
door
was
opened
and
they
entered
the
inn
a
few
moments
elapsed
during
which
a
number
of
priests
and
citizens
assembled
in
that
part
of
the
rue
du
rhone
which
lies
between
the
tour
perce
and
the
molard
presently
the
inn
door
opened
again
and
the
four
huguenots
came
out
with
farel
and
saunier
when
they
saw
them
the
crowd
became
agitated
devils

going
shouted
the
priests
as
the
two
evangelists
and
their
friends
passed
along
farel
seeing
the
numbers
around
him
wished
to
exhort
them
he
walked
along
but
perrin
would
not
permit
it
representing
to
him
that
it
was
necessary
to
push
on
quickly
for
fear
the
priests
should
block
the
way
when
the
reformers
reached
the
water
edge
they
got
into
the
boat
with
their
defenders
the
boatmen
immediately
began
to
row
and
the
crowd
that
lined
the
shore
could
do
nothing
but
hoot
perrin
fearing
violence
would
not
land
at
any
of
the
towns
or

but
steered
the
boat
to
an
unfrequented
place
between
morges
and
lausanne
here
they
all
got
on
shore
and
embraced
each
other
after
which
the
huguenots
returned
to
geneva
and
the
reformers
made
their
way
to

farel
and

farel
expelled
from
geneva
with
a
heart
full
of
love
for
those
whom
he
had
been
obliged
to
quit
meditated
on
the
means
of
evangelising
them
and
like
a
skilful
general
was
preparing
even
during
his
retreat
for
a
new
and
more
successful
struggle
after
having
saluted
the
christians
of
orbe
and
grandson
he
departed
for
the
village
of
yvonand
on
the
southern
shore
of
the
lake
of
neuchatel
where
dwelt
a
youthful
christian
anthony
froment
by
name
born
at
val
de
frières
in
dauphiny
in
and
consequently
a
year
younger
than
calvin
and
his
countryman
farel
the
reformer
invited
several
evangelists
to
meet
him
in
this
village
and
about
the
middle
of
october
there
came
olivetan
who
had
been
unable
to
stay
in
geneva
after
the
departure
of
his
two
friends
adam
martin
probably
martin
gonin
the
waldensian
and
guido
who
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
belgian
reformer
guido
or
guy
von
brès
who
with
farel
saunier
froment
and
others
formed
a
little
council
farel
gave
an
account
of
his
mission
he
described
his
journey
to
the
valleys
of
piedmont
and
the
stormy
reception
he
had
met
with
at
geneva
they
all
looked
with
interest
on
the
fugitive
missionary
who
had
escaped
as
by
a
miracle
from
the
violence
of
the
genevan
priests
froment
in
particular
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
reformer
every
word
of
farel
made
a
deep
impression
on
him
and
disgusted
with
the
ministers
of
popery
he
pitied
the
fate
of
the
huguenots
deprived
of
god
word
by
the
intrigues
of
the
clergy
farel
fixing
his
eyes
on
him
said
and
try
if
you
can
find
an
entrance
into
geneva
to
preach
there
froment
was
disturbed
and
speechless
he
possessed
learning
and
talents
but
he
was
young
and
without
experience
and
wanted
that
perseverance
and
firmness
by
which
other
reformers
were
distinguished
his
feelings
were
sensitive
his
imagination
was
ardent
but
his
character
was
uneven
and
rather
fickle
he
is
believed
to
have
been
drawn
to
the
reformation
more
by
witnessing
the
excesses
of
rome
than
by
the
inner
charms
of
the
word
of
god
father
he
said
to
farel
can
i
face
the
enemies
from
whom
you
were
compelled
to
flee
replied
farel
i
began
at
aigle
where
i
was
a
schoolmaster
at
first
and
taught
little
children
so
that
even
the
priests
gave
me
liberty
to
preach
true
they
soon
repented
and
even
now
i
seem
to
hear
the
curate
exclaiming
i
would
sooner
have
lost
my
hand
than
introduced
this
man
for
he
will
ruin
all
our
business
but
it
was
too
late
the
word
of
god
had
begun
its
work
and
the
mass
and
images
fell
froment
who
was
at
that
time
full
of
ardour
and
zeal
began
to
familiarise
himself
gradually
with
the
idea
of
going
to
the
city
that
drove
out
the
prophets
farel
observing
this
persevered
and
encouraged
his
disciple
by
the
recollection
of
the
great
dangers
they
had
once
incurred
together
dear
froment
he
said
fear
the
men
of
geneva
but
were
you
not
with
me
when
i
planted
the
gospel
at
bienne
among
the
mountains
in
the
valley
of
saint
imier
at
tavannes
and
near
that
mountain
pierre
pertuis
which
julius
cæsar
tunnelled
were
you
not
with
me
when
i
went
to
neuchatel
and
preached
in
the
streets
and
and
in
the
surrounding
villages
do
you
not
remember
that
we
very
often
received
our
rent
that
is
blows
and
abuse
once
in
particular
at
valengin
where
my
blood
remained
for
more
than
four
years
on
the
pavement
of
a
little
chapel
near
which
the
women
and
priests
bruised
my
head
against
the
walls
so
that
we
were
both
of
us
nearly
killed
these
remembrances
were
not
very
encouraging
some
sided
with
farel
others
thought
that
a
man
of
was
too
young
to
be
launched
into
such
a
terrible
gulf
for
geneva
really
alarmed
them
froment
could
not
yet
make
up
his
mind
to
attempt
the
enterprise
another
thought
absorbed
farel
sidenote
olivetan
scruples
overcome
that
pious
reformer
heart
was
still
full
of
the
glorious
synod
of
the
valleys
at
which
it
had
been
decided
to
translate
the
bible
he
had
several
times
already
entreated
olivetan
to
undertake
that
great
work
he
repeated
his
entreaties
both
in
the
assembly
and
in
private
near
yvonand
there
is
a
number
of
hills
which
form
a
sort
of
labyrinth
around
a
little
river
beautiful
forests
of
majestic
oaks
stretch
their
branches
so
wide
and
high
that
it
is
possible
to
walk
beneath
their
immense
leafy
circumstance
which
has
earned
for
this
district
the
name
of
arcadia
was
it
in
a
private
room
or
in
these
woods
that
farel
urged
olivetan
as
they
trampled
underfoot
the
dry
leaves
which
autumn
had
already
loosened
from
the
trees
i
can
not
tell
in
either
case
he
no
longer
solicited
he
but
froment
with
respect
to
his
unwillingness
to
upon
such
a
task
said
he
i
express
hebrew
and
greek
eloquence
in
french
which
is
but
a
barbarous
language
compared
with
them
you
know
it
is
as
difficult
as
to
teach
the
hoarse
raven
to
sing
the
song
of
the
nightingale
farel
tried
to
encourage
him
he
might
do
it
olivetan
style
is
considering
the
time
one
of
remarkable
elegance
but
calvin
cousin
alleged
other
reasons
he
had
certain
fears
an
undertaking
he
said
like
a
ball
in
a
public
building
wherein
everybody
dances
as
he
likes
i
shall
be
encompassed
with
critics
correctors
and
calumniators
they
will
not
be
friends
i
am
very
sure
but
strangers
devoid
of
charity
christians
who
will
philosophise
about
the
dot
over
an
and
bring
forward
a
thousand
false
jerome
undertook
a
similar
work
said
farel
jerome
exclaimed
olivetan
had
more
trouble
in
answering
such
people
than
in
all
his
work
how
could
i
do
who
am
but
a
petty
page
a
mere
varlet
compared
with
such
a
knight
but
farel
pressed
him
so
much
that
he
thought
himself
bound
to
undertake
it
he
promised
and
it
was
well
known
that
what
he
promised
he
would
perform
farel
had
won
a
great
victory
the
french
churches
would
have
a
good
translation
of
scripture
but
a
journey
was
necessary
the
alps
he
said
to
his
friend
to
the
waldensian
valleys
and
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
brethren
about
the
translation
then
turning
towards
other
members
of
the
synod
he
added
you
adam
martin
and
guido
go
with
him
and
preach
to
them
the
doctrine
that
will
correct
all
their
errors
this
mission
which
was
to
result
in
the
publication
of
the
bible
in
french
was
not
without
importance
or
without
danger
the
evangelists
proposed
to
take
the
direct
road
by
mount
bernard
but
before
reaching
the
lake
of
geneva
they
would
have
to
cross
a
district
belonging
to
the
duke
of
savoy
now
the
duke
the
count
of
challans
and
the
sieur
de
bellegarde
were
not
at
all
anxious
that
the
waldensians
of
the
piedmontese
valleys
should
unite
with
the
reformers
of
switzerland
the
four
friends
determined
therefore
to
travel
by
night
having
supped
at
yvonand
with
farel
and
the
other
brethren
they
began
their
journey
immediately
after
it
was
at
the
end
of
october
they
travelled
through
the
darkness
led
by
a
guide
who
knew
the
country
well
they
successfully
accomplished
their
night
journey
and
arrived
at
vevey
the
next
day
before
they
began
immediately
to
speak
of
christ
for
they
had
no
wish
to
fall
into
sloth
and
carelessness
from
vevey
they
proceeded
to
aigle
where
they
found
the
evangelical
christians
of
the
place
assembled
to
receive
them
salute
you
in
christ
said
adam
exhort
you
to
reprove
one
another
as
becomes
brethren
and
ministers
of
the
word
of
truth
sidenote
a
minister
home
when
they
had
almost
reached
the
pretty
village
of
bex
in
the
midst
of
its
orchards
and
walnut
trees
in
front
of
the
picturesque
dent
de
morcles
and
the
huge
dent
du
midi
martin
was
attacked
with
severe
pains
his
companions
immediately
looked
for
a
house
where
they
could
lodge
the
sick
man
but
the
country
was
so
poor
that
they
could
not
find
a
room
fit
to
receive
him
these
poor
brethren
were
on
the
highway
with
their
suffering
friend
anxious
and
yet
not
knowing
what
to
do
some
one
told
them
that
about
a
league
behind
them
at
the
village
of
ollon
lived
the
minister
claude
who
would
gladly
receive
them
they
accordingly
retraced
their
steps
and
arrived
at
ollon
a
little
place
in
the
midst
of
the
shady
woods
which
extend
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
on
which
are
situated
the
charming
hamlets
of
chesières
and
villars
they
asked
for
the
pastor
house
and
it
was
shown
them
they
dragged
their
friend
to
it
and
knocked
at
the
door
claude
opened
it
himself
and
at
the
sight
of
a
pale
and
fainting
man
invited
the
strangers
in
but
on
a
sudden
hasty
footsteps
were
heard
a
woman
appeared
flushed
with
anger
and
with
fiery
violent
wicked
pitiless
scolding
woman
she
was
the
unfortunate
pastor
wife
she
screamed
and
gesticulated
and
instead
of
being
grave
as
scripture
requires
such
women
to
be
she
forgot
all
restraint
and
broke
out
this
a
sick
man
if
you
receive
him
into
the
house
i
will
leave
it
claude
durst
not
say
a
word
the
voice
of
this
xantippe
rose
higher
and
higher
and
at
last
she
turned
her
back
on
her
husband
and
the
strangers
and
disappeared
in
a
passion
poor
claude
was
sorely
vexed
and
ashamed
will
not
be
the
cause
of
a
divorce
said
adam
will
go
away
the
pastor
a
good
but
weak
man
who
could
not
keep
his
wife
in
order
let
them
go
sidenote
the
suffering
missionaries
thus
not
a
house
was
opened
to
receive
an
expiring
missionary
the
poor
evangelists
were
quite
disheartened
us
cheer
up
said
they
make
haste
to
reach
the
alps
the
four
travellers
resumed
their
journey
martin
probably
on
horseback
but
on
arriving
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
beyond
martigny
his
pains
increased
martin
was
half
dead
olivetan
suffered
from
an
inflammation
of
the
bowels
guido
was
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
adam
alone
was
unaffected
but
ere
long
he
too
was
attacked
seized
with
cholera
it
is
his
own
word
he
thought
his
end
was
come
the
four
missionaries
dragged
themselves
painfully
along
the
brink
of
the
torrent
whose
noisy
waters
alone
disturbed
the
silence
around
them
they
lifted
their
eyes
mournfully
towards
those
gigantic
mountains
which
it
seemed
impossible
for
them
to
cross
and
ineffectually
sought
a
refuge
in
the
poorest
of
cottages
one
thing
however
was
left
faithfulness
of
their
master
they
said
to
one
another
takes
us
down
into
the
abyss
when
he
pleases
but
his
grace
is
almighty
to
lift
us
out
of
it
again
at
this
moment
they
caught
sight
of
a
wretched
house
they
went
up
to
it
explained
their
condition
and
happily
they
were
received
in
consideration
of
their
money
god
whom
they
had
invoked
alleviated
their
disorder
and
the
next
day
they
were
able
to
resume
their
journey
feebly
at
starting
but
gradually
the
mountain
air
gave
them
strength
they
had
been
forced
to
incur
extraordinary
expenses
and
adam
who
held
the
purse
smiled
as
he
saw
its
shrunken
condition
their
good
humour
began
to
return
he
showed
his
friends
the
lean
little
bag
and
said
merrily
our
purse
has
been
seized
with
such
cruel
pains
in
the
inside
that
there
is
scarcely
anything
left
in
it
they
climbed
the
mountain
and
needing
rest
entered
an
inn
situated
between
martigny
and
the
convent
of
bernard
they
soon
observed
one
of
the
monks
and
approaching
him
desired
in
spite
of
their
weakness
to
discharge
their
duty
they
spoke
to
him
of
jesus
christ
and
of
the
grace
he
gives
to
sinners
the
monk
who
belonged
to
the
augustine
order
listened
attentively
to
their
words
and
began
to
talk
with
them
while
the
evangelists
pressed
him
closely
by
means
of
the
holy
scriptures
he
was
touched
and
convinced
will
quit
antichrist
he
exclaimed
adam
immediately
took
paper
sat
down
and
wrote
is
a
letter
for
master
farel
he
said
to
the
friar
to
him
and
he
will
tell
you
what
you
have
to
do
the
evangelist
and
the
monk
separated
even
down
to
our
days
conversions
have
been
effected
among
the
brethren
of
this
monastery
at
last
the
four
friends
arrived
among
the
waldenses
who
listened
joyfully
to
their
words
of
truth
and
love
some
of
these
alpine
shepherds
were
even
known
to
have
gone
two
days
journey
to
hear
them
these
poor
christians
handed
over
to
olivetan
towards
the
printing
of
the
bible
gold
immense
sum
for
them
and
begged
that
the
publication
should
be
hurried
on
olivetan
and
the
barbes
came
to
terms
here
finishes
this
episode
which
to
some
may
have
little
interest
except
so
far
as
it
is
connected
with
the
history
of
the
french
protestant
translation
of
the
holy
scriptures
sidenote
deputation
of
peasants
when
this
news
reached
farel
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
another
country
the
young
and
gentle
fabri
whom
the
reformer
loved
as
a
father
loves
a
son
was
preaching
at
neuchatel
when
one
day
he
saw
some
peasants
arrive
who
had
been
deputed
from
the
village
of
bole
in
the
parish
of
boudry
these
good
people
entreated
him
to
come
and
settle
among
them
the
parish
priest
a
worthy
man
by
the
way
looked
upon
the
gospel
not
as
a
proclamation
of
grace
but
as
a
second
law
more
perfect
than
the
first
having
heard
the
reformers
inveigh
against
the
corruption
that
prevailed
in
the
church
he
had
at
first
gone
with
them
but
he
soon
hesitated
and
shrunk
back
when
he
found
that
their
new
morality
reposed
on
a
new
faith
in
fact
the
ministers
who
preached
in
those
quarters
said
that
the
gospel
substituted
a
regenerative
doctrine
for
the
dead
ordinances
of
the
law
that
christ
religion
did
not
consist
in
practices
commanded
by
the
priests
or
even
in
a
purely
outward
morality
but
in
a
new
heart
from
which
proceeds
a
new
life
law
said
calvin
in
later
years
like
grammar
which
after
it
has
taught
the
first
elements
refers
the
learners
to
theology
or
some
other
science
in
order
that
they
may
be
perfected
the
priest
of
boudry
would
have
thought
himself
but
too
happy
to
see
his
parishioners
endowed
with
that
external
morality
which
did
not
satisfy
the
evangelicals
a
zealous
doctor
of
the
law
he
turned
against
the
doctors
of
grace
and
hence
it
happened
that
a
few
of
his
parishioners
hastened
to
neuchatel
fabri
followed
these
honest
people
and
the
gentle
and
moderate
reformer
was
immediately
engaged
in
a
severe
campaign
the
village
of
bole
was
for
the
reformer
the
little
town
of
boudry
for
the
priest
there
were
two
places
of
worship
in
the
parish
the
church
and
a
chapel
called
the
pontareuse
situated
in
a
low
place
the
government
decided
that
this
should
be
for
the
use
of
both
parties
many
catholics
more
fanatical
than
their
priest
entered
into
a
plot
to
oppose
the
worship
of
the
reformed
on
the
first
sunday
in
november
the
latter
went
down
full
of
peace
and
joy
into
the
wild
valley
through
which
flows
the
torrent
of
the
reuse
and
where
a
few
remains
of
the
little
chapel
are
still
visible
they
entered
and
took
their
seats
on
the
benches
while
fabri
went
up
into
the
pulpit
meantime
the
catholics
girding
on
their
swords
which
was
not
usually
done
entered
the
chapel
and
drew
up
near
the
altar
while
fabri
was
preaching
all
the
bells
suddenly
rang
out
together
so
as
to
drown
his
voice
and
the
more
he
besought
them
to
let
him
finish
the
louder
rang
the
catholics
in
the
belfry
then
those
who
were
in
the
church
began
to
move
pushing
and
shouting
fabri
seeing
this
disorder
and
profanation
ceased
speaking
and
left
the
church
he
had
hardly
got
outside
when
the
catholics
near
the
altar
ran
and
shut
the
door
and
fell
like
madmen
on
the
surprised
hesitating
and
unarmed
congregation
the
confusion
was
very
great
and
it
was
this
that
saved
the
innocent
no
one
distinguished
friends
from
enemies
each
man
struck
the
first
he
met
one
or
two
evangelicals
endeavoured
to
open
the
door
and
at
last
they
succeeded
and
rushed
out
but
their
position
was
not
bettered
adversaries
delighted
at
being
able
to
distinguish
them
says
an
upon
them
like
wolves
upon
lambs
threatening
them
with
death
help
us
exclaimed
the
poor
people
scattered
here
and
there
at
last
they
succeeded
in
reaching
their
homes
miraculously
as
it
were
but
with
many
bruises
they
were
happy
at
being
in
peace
heavenly
father
fought
for
us
mightily
they
said
clubs
and
swords
only
served
to
increase
their
repugnance
for
that
theocratical
tyranny
which
men
had
substituted
for
the
mild
gospel
of
jesus
christ
sidenote
a
protestant
rising
the
next
day
some
of
the
reformed
went
to
neuchatel
against
the
advice
of
fabri
who
desired
to
wait
for
deliverance
from
the
lord
and
not
from
men
to
the
friends
who
met
them
on
the
road
they
told
the
story
of
the
plot
to
which
they
had
nearly
been
victims
all
the
villages
between
boudry
and
neuchatel
were
in
commotion
and
the
peasants
of
auvernier
and
colombier
flew
to
arms
ready
to
join
the
neuchatelans
if
they
went
to
the
help
of
their
brethren
the
council
of
neuchatel
decreed
that
henceforth
the
chapel
of
pontareuse
should
belong
entirely
to
the
reformed
the
catholics
resolved
to
pay
no
attention
to
this
on
christmas
day
the
priest
had
already
sung
two
masses
before
the
hour
appointed
for
the
evangelical
preaching
and
at
the
moment
when
the
reformers
arrived
he
resolutely
began
high
mass
loud
and
long
singing
although
there
was
scarcely
anybody
to
hear
it
the
reformed
waited
patiently
but
when
the
service
was
ended
and
just
as
they
were
hoping
that
their
turn
had
come
they
were
surprised
to
see
the
catholics
arriving
in
a
crowd
fabri
then
wanted
to
go
into
the
pulpit
but
had
great
difficulty
one
pushed
him
one
way
and
one
another
and
all
shouted
out
against
him
order
being
a
little
restored
one
of
the
reformers
went
as
was
customary
to
take
a
chalice
for
the
celebration
of
the
supper
the
priest
who
had
remained
in
the
church
watching
what
was
going
on
rushed
upon
him
and
snatched
the
vessel
from
his
hands
crying
out
sacrilege
the
friends
of
the
priests
determined
to
put
an
end
to
the
service
once
for
all
of
them
rushed
like
raging
lions
upon
the
reformed
and
hit
them
with
their
fists
and
one
of
them
struck
a
governor
probably
one
of
the
communal
councillors
with
a
knife
but
god
says
the
document
we
quote
only
his
clothes
to
be
pierced
this
did
not
end
the
battle
others
going
to
a
room
behind
the
altar
where
they
had
hidden
some
large
sticks
dealt
their
blows
lustily
on
all
sides
the
women
rushed
into
the
vineyards
tore
up
the
and
brought
them
to
as
many
of
their
husbands
as
had
neither
sticks
nor
knives
some
of
them
left
the
chapel
and
picked
up
stones
to
throw
at
the
minister
who
was
still
in
the
pulpit
and
kill
him
from
every
side
they
fell
upon
the
poor
evangelicals
calling
them
dogs
even
the
of
boudry
whose
duty
it
was
to
preserve
order
joined
in
the
riot
threw
off
his
official
robe
and
loudly
hooting
struck
harder
than
the
rest
the
parish
priest
who
loved
the
law
so
much
had
suddenly
lost
his
balance
incensed
and
beside
himself
stripped
to
his
doublet
and
like
a
brigand
he
directed
the
battle
his
friends
well
provided
with
arquebuses
bludgeons
knives
and
other
weapons
seeing
that
the
evangelists
had
rallied
round
their
pastor
rushed
upon
them
intending
to
kill
many
of
them
it
was
god
will
that
this
wolf
should
be
stopped
on
the
way
says
the
official
document
be
driven
back
into
his
den
the
reformed
who
parried
the
blows
as
well
as
they
could
with
their
hands
only
at
last
succeeded
in
reaching
their
houses
they
told
their
relations
and
friends
what
had
happened
and
gave
god
thanks
is
indeed
a
great
miracle
they
said
with
emotion
there
was
nobody
killed
but
the
lord
jesus
christ
is
a
good
shepherd
he
keeps
his
sheep
so
well
in
the
midst
of
the
sword
the
fire
the
lions
and
even
death
itself
that
the
wolves
can
not
snatch
them
out

his
hand

the

while
these
songs
of
thanksgiving
were
being
sung
in
the
houses
of
the
evangelists
the
curé
was
triumphing
in
the
church
the
battle
was
scarcely
terminated
by
the
retreat
of
the
reformed
when
proud
of
the
victory
he
had
won
by
stones
and
clubs
he
laid
down
the
stake
with
which
he
had
armed
himself
covered
his
head
arranged
his
disordered
doublet
put
on
his
sacerdotal
robes
and
entered
the
church
of
boudry
with
a
grave
and
composed
air
seeing
it
full
and
wishing
to
profit
by
the
advantage
he
had
gained
he
went
into
the
pulpit
and
exclaimed
in
his
burlesque
manner
strangers

come
of
their

accord

deadly

advances

some
of
the
friends
of
the
reformed
hurried
off
to
fabri
and
reported
to
him
that
the
priest
offered
to
prove
all
he
had
said
particularly
that
he
could
absolve
from
the
seven
deadly
sins
and
those
of
the
five
senses
without
loss
of
time
fabri
appeared
before
the
castellan
and
councillors
of
boudry
and
asked
for
a
public
disputation
offering
to
die
in
case
he
could
not
show
that
all
he
had
preached
was
true
and
that
what
the
priest
had
said
was
false
the
latter
bluntly
refused
all
public
discussion
he
did
not
like
combats
of
that
kind
and
compensated
himself
in
another
fashion
one
day
as
he
sat
half
undressed
at
his
window
watching
the
birds
as
they
darted
through
the
air
and
the
people
who
were
walking
in
the
street
he
saw
fabri
passing
in
front
of
his
house
in
great
excitement
he
called
to
him
and
began
abusing
him

he
said
stretching
his

out

it

i
will
show
you
that
i

no
forger
at
these
words
the
alarmed
priest
exclaimed

something
else
to
do
besides
disputing
with
a
like
you
and
he
retired
hastily
from
the
window
such
were
the
struggles
the
reformers
had
to
go
through
in
order
to
transform
the
church
this
transformation
was
going
on

ere

whole
principality

by
a
bear
which
killed

hubert
got
on
the
back

rode
him
home

was
about
to
take

it
was
the
november
he
reached
lausanne
whence
he
took
his
way
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
towards
geneva
the
poor
young
man
stopped
sometimes
on
the
road
and
asked
himself
whether
the
enterprise
he
was
about
to
attempt
was
not
sheer
madness
he
said
will
not
shrink
back
for
it
is
by
the
small
and
weak
things
of
this
world
that
god
designs
to
confound
the
great
and
then
he
resumed
his
journey
the
genevese
were
much
occupied
at
that
time
with
signs
in
the
heaven
a
strange
blaze
shone
in
the
firmament
every
night
their
eyes
were
fixed
upon
a
long
train
of
light
and
the
most
learned
endeavoured
to
divine
the
prognostics
to
be
drawn
from
it
the
new
moon
says
a
manuscript
appeared
a
comet
at
two
in
the
morning
which
was
visible
from
the
september
to
the
of
the
following
month
about
this
time
anthony
froment
arrived
in
geneva
many
huguenots
irritated
at
the
reception
given
to
farel
despaired
of
seeing
geneva
reformed
and
its
liberties
settled
on
a
firm
basis
some
however
who
were
adepts
in
astronomy
wondered
whether
that
marvellous
sheen
did
not
foretel
that
a
divine
light
would
also
illuminate
the
country
they
waited
and
froment
appeared
sidenote
froment
coldly
received
the
young
dauphinese
was
at
first
much
embarrassed
he
tried
to
enter
into
conversation
with
one
and
another
but
they
were
very
short
with
the
stranger
he
hoped
to
find
acquaintance
with
whom
he
could
retire
safely
and
familiarly
but
he
saw
none
but
strange
faces
he
said
can
not
tell
what
to
do
except
it
be
to
return
for
i
find
no
door
to
preach
the
gospel
then
calling
to
mind
the
names
of
the
chief
huguenots
friends
of
farel
who
as
he
said
would
give
him
the
warmest
welcome
froment
resolved
to
apply
to
them
and
waited
upon
baudichon
de
la
claude
bernard
goulaz
vandel
and
ami
perrin
but
strange
to
say
he
everywhere
met
with
embarrassed
manners
and
long
faces
the
mean
appearance
of
the
young
dauphinese
disconcerted
even
the
best
disposed
farel
they
thought
might
at
least
have
sent
a
scholar
and
not
a
working
man
geneva
was
an
important
and
learned
city
there
were
men
of
capacity
among
the
roman
clergy
who
must
be
opposed
by
a
minister
of
good
appearance
a
doctor
the
huguenots
bowed
out
the
mean
little
man
said
froment
returning
to
his
inn
found
them
so
cold
so
timid
and
so
startled
at
what
had
been
done
to
farel
and
his
companions
that
they
dared
not
unbosom
themselves
and
still
less
receive
me
into
their
houses
confounded
and
dejected
at
seeing
all
his
plans
overthrown
he
walked
thoughtfully
through
the
streets
with
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
he
entered
the
inn
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
and
asked
himself
what
was
to
be
done
next
those
who
seemed
to
wish
to
hear
the
gospel
looked
at
him
with
contemptuous
eyes
if
he
spoke
to
any
persons
they
turned
their
backs
on
him
not
one
door
was
opened
to
the
word
of
god
his
feelings
were
soured
wearied
and
dejected
he
sank
under
the
weight
and
lost
courage
am
greatly
tempted
to
go
back
he
said
froment
went
to
the
landlord
paid
his
bill
strapped
his
little
bundle
on
his
shoulders
and
without
taking
leave
of
the
huguenots
bent
his
steps
towards
the
swiss
gate
and
quitted
the
city
but
he
had
not
gone
many
yards
before
he
stopped
he
felt
as
if
he
were
detained
by
an
invisible
hand
a
voice
was
heard
in
his
conscience
telling
him
he
was
doing
wrong
a
force
greater
than
that
of
man
compelled
him
to
retrace
his
steps
he
returned
to
his
room
shut
the
door
and
sat
down
leaning
on
the
table
with
his
head
in
his
hands
he
asked
what
god
wanted
with
him
he
began
to
pray
and
seemed
to
witness
in
himself
the
realisation
of
the
promise
will
lead
thee
in
the
way
in
which
thou
shouldst
he
called
to
mind
what
farel
had
told
him
and
what
the
reformer
had
done
at
aigle
a
flash
of
light
illumined
his
soul
they
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
in
geneva
because
his
appearance
is
mean
be
it
so
he
will
undertake
with
humility
the
work
that
god
gives
him
and
since
he
is
rejected
as
an

thought
that
the

was
suspicious
to
which
more
benevolent

replied
that
in
any

verses
explaining

in
an
interesting

after
which
as
he
had
some
knowledge
of
medicine
he
would
ask
them
whether
any
in
their
families
were
sick
and
distribute
harmless
remedies
among
them
it
was
by
the
instruction
of
the
mind
and
the
healing
of

some
of

in

off

nothing

he

even
more
than

had
promised
he
taught
arithmetic
which
was
very
acceptable
to
the
genevese
who
are
by
nature
rather
calculating
it
was
the
sermon
however
which
the
hearers
waited
for

that
was
very
different
from
what
they
had
homily
instead
of
a
philippic
in
the
course
of
his
lessons
froment
read
at
one
time
a
story
from
the
bible
at
another
one
of
our
sermons
giving
the
scripture
as
the
scriptures
of
god
explaining
as
he
went
on
the
difficult
words
and
then
applying
the
doctrine
affectionately
to
the
consciences
of
his
hearers
they
were

forward

brought
there
froment
joyfully
marked
the
effect
produced
by
his
teaching

much
astonished
for
they
had
never
heard
such
doctrine
some
began
to
understand
that
evangelical
christianity
did
not
consist
in
mocking
the
priests
and
the
mass
but
in
knowing
and
loving
the
saviour
who
heard
him
conceived
in
their
hearts
some
understanding
of
the
truth
in
a
short
time
the
success
of
this
simple
instruction
surpassed
the
hopes
of
the
teacher

beautiful
discourses
delivered
at

very
differently
from

nothing

the

of
the

nothing
was

but
the
evangelist
at
the
epoch
of

nothing
was
more
striking
than
the
great
difference
between
the
instruction
given
by
the
priests
and
that
given
by
the
reformers

enough

their
patrons
but
they
chirp
out

things
in

manner
their
discourses
have
no
reverence
for

are
full
of
fine
words

affectation

many
of

interested
enlightened

would
overthrow

prepared
to
go
out
claudine
remained
in
her
place
she
looked
at
the
teacher
and
at
last
exclaimed
aloud
it
true
what
you
say
answered
the
reformer
it
all
proved
by
the
gospel
not
the
mass
mentioned
in
it
is
the
book
from
which
you
preached
a
genuine
new
testament
madame
levet
eagerly
desired
to
have
it
taking
courage
she
said
lend
it
me
froment
gave
it
to
her
and
claudine
placing
it
carefully
under
her
cloak
among
her
relics
and
beads
went
out
with
her
who
was
beginning
to
see
all
her
wishes
accomplished
as
claudine
returned
home
she
did
not
talk
much
with
paula
hers
was
one
of
those
deep
natures
that
speak
little
with
man
but
much
with
god
entering
her
house
she
went
straight
to
her
room
and
shut
herself
in
taking
nothing
but
the
book
with
her
and
being
determined
not
to
come
out
again
until
she
had
found
the
solution
of
the
grand
problem
with
which
her
conscience
was
occupied
on
which
side
is
truth
at
rome
or
at
wittemberg
having
made
arrangements
that
they
should
not
wait
meals
for
her
or
knock
at
her
door
remained
apart
says
froment
three
days
and
three
nights
without
eating
or
drinking
but
with
prayers
fasting
and
supplication
the
book
lay
open
on
the
table
before
her
she
read
it
constantly
and
falling
on
her
knees
asked
for
the
divine
light
to
be
shed
abroad
in
her
heart
claudine
probably
did
not
possess
an
understanding
of
the
highest
range
but
she
had
a
tender
conscience
with
her
the
first
duty
was
to
submit
to
god
the
first
want
to
resemble
him
the
first
desire
to
find
everlasting
happiness
in
him
she
did
not
reach
christ
through
the
understanding
conscience
was
the
path
that
led
her
to
him
an
awakening
conscience
is
the
first
symptom
of
conversion
and
consequently
of
reformation
sometimes
claudine
heard
in
her
heart
a
voice
pressing
her
to
come
to
jesus
then
her
superstitious
ideas
would
suddenly
return
and
she
rejected
the
lord
invitation
but
she
soon
discovered
that
the
practices
to
which
she
had
abandoned
herself
were
wells
where
there
had
never
been
any
water
determined
to
go
astray
no
longer
she
desired
to
go
straight
to
christ
it
was
then
she
redoubled
those
and
supplications
of
which
froment
speaks
and
read
the
holy
scriptures
with
eagerness
at
last
she
understood
that
divine
word
which
spake
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
oh
wonderful
she
is
saved
this
salvation
did
not
puff
her
up
she
discovered
that
grace
of
god
trickled
slowly
into
her
but
the
least
drop
coming
from
the
holy
spirit
seemed
a
well
that
never
dried
three
days
were
thus
spent
for
the
same
space
of
time
paul
remained
in
prayer
at
damascus
sidenote
her
conversion
madame
levet
having
read
the
gospel
again
and
again
desired
to
see
the
man
who
had
first
led
her
to
know
it
she
sent
for
him
froment
crossed
the
rhone
for
she
lived
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
on
the
side
of
gervais
he
entered
and
when
she
saw
him
claudine
rose
in
emotion
approached
him
and
being
unable
to
speak
burst
into
tears
tears
says
the
evangelist
on
the
floor
she
had
no
other
language
when
she
recovered
madame
levet
courteously
begged
froment
to
sit
down
and
told
him
how
god
had
opened
to
her
the
door
of
heaven
at
the
same
time
she
showed
herself
determined
to
profess
without
fear
before
men
the
faith
that
caused
her
happiness
she
said
i
ever
thank
god
sufficiently
for
having
enlightened
me
froment
had
come
to
strengthen
this
lady
and
he
was
himself
strengthened
he
was
in
great
admiration
at
her
speak
as
she
did
a
conversion
so
spiritual
and
so
serious
must
needs
have
a
great
signification
for
the
reformation
of
geneva
and
as
calvin
says
in
other
circumstances
where
also
only
one
woman
seems
to
have
been
converted

love

and
vexed
as
they
were
at

their

in

they
could
not

the

flattered
with

made

of
days
but
on

all
his
bad

returned
when

said
hastily

i
will
compel

to
ask
my
pardon
on

on

the
deputation
reported
this
language
to
the
council

were
annoyed
at

while
the
bishop
was
sending
these
messages
to
geneva
which
did
not
advance
the
cause
of

on

was
endeavouring
in

froment
being
in
communication
with
farel
and
the
reformed
of
switzerland
received
from
them
testaments
tracts
and
controversial
works
which
his
friends
and
he
distributed
all
over
the
city
where
they
were
read
with
eagerness
every
day
more
persons
were
won
over
to
the
evangelical
faith
they
were
of
all
conditions
of
life
a
certain
tradesman
named
guérin
a
listened
while
working
in
his
shop
to
all
that
was
said
around
him
and
thought
seriously
of
religion
and
of
the
abuses
of
popery
one
day
he
determined
to
visit
the
croix
and
the
words
he
heard
there
touched
his
heart
and
enlightened
his
mind
being
sensible
intelligent
modest
and
of
decided
character
he
gave
himself
up
with
all
his
heart
to
god
cause
and
ere
long
became
froment
helper
there
were
also
persons
of
all
ages
among
the
converts
claude
bernard
had
a
daughter
between
seven
and
eight
years
old
whom
he
early
introduced
to
the
knowledge
of
scripture
the
precocious
understanding
was
struck
with
certain
simple
and
clear
passages
which
condemned
the
popular
superstitions
and
the
little
controversialist
we
are
told
confounded
the
ignorant
priests
unable
to
answer
her
they
spread
a
report
that
she
was
possessed
of
the
devil
a
frenchman
of
distinction
passing
through
geneva
wished
to
see
her
and
was
charmed
with
her
infantile
graces
and
piety
it
was
soon
apparent
that
there
was
something
more
than
a
new
doctrine
a
moral
reformation
accompanied
the
revival
of
faith
in
the
days
of
her
bigoted
catholicism
claudine
levet
had
been
very
fond
of
dress
her
conscience
now
reproached
her
with
having
been
unreasonable
in
her
love
of
costly
attire
and
more
eager
to
ornament
her
body
than
to
adorn
her
soul
one
day
she
shut
herself
up
in
that
room
where
she
had
heard
the
call
of
god
stripped
off
says
froment
superfluous
bravery
laid
aside
those
ornaments
and
trappings
which
had
only
served
to
show
her
off
in
a
vainglorious
way
as
a
peacock
spreads
his
tail
and
from
that
time
she
wore
a
plain
and
becoming
dress
having
sold
her
beautiful
robes
and
other
belongings
she
gave
the
money
to
the
poor
particularly
to
the
evangelicals
of
france
who
having
been
banished
from
their
homes
on
account
of
truth
had
come
to
geneva
all
her
life
she
loved
to
receive
refugees
in
her
house
they
said
of
her
she
follows
the
example
of
tabitha
who
was
called
dorcas
acts
ix
and
deserves
to
be
kept
in
perpetual
remembrance
claudine
did
more
than
this
she
spoke
frankly
and
meekly
of
the
precious
truth
she
had
received
and
it
wherever
she
happened
to
be
in
the
city
the
priests
alarmed
at
such
an
astonishing
transformation
endeavoured
to
bring
her
back
to
the
practices
of
the
church
but
claudine
them
tenderly
by
scripture
what
was
necessary
namely
faith
and
charity
all
in
the
city
were
surprised
to
hear
her
talk
as
she
did
sidenote
genevese
ladies
the
news
of
her
conversion
made
a
great
sensation
particularly
among
the
genevese
ladies
one
day
when
the
most
worldly
of
them
had
met
together
they
talked
of
nothing
but
madame
levet
and
her
estrangement
from
the
mass
and
from
amusements
they
were
pernette
balthasarde
wife
of
a
councillor
the
wife
of
baudichon
de
la
maison
neuve
the
wife
of
claude
pastor
jeanne
marie
de
fernex
and
many
other
rich
and
honourable
ladies
they
said
is
it
that
she
has
changed
in
so
short
a
time
they
had
loved
her
and
all
the
more
regretted
that
she
was
they
vented
their
anger
on
froment
has
heard
that
creature
they
said
been
bewitched
by
him
these
ladies
resolved
that
they
would
see
her
no
more
claudine
did
not
despair
of
her
friends
she
continued
to
live
for
god
and
all
might
see
that
a
holy
life
full
of
good
works
proceeded
from
her
faith
the
genevan
ladies
although
unwilling
to
visit
her
watched
her
and
observing
she
persevered
in
and
was
still
a
constant
pattern
of
holy
living
they
drew
near
her
they
were
curious
to
know
the
cause
of
this
singular
change
and
began
to
speak
to
her
when
they
met
her
some
even
going
to
see
her
claudine
received
them
affectionately
spoke
to
them
about
that
which
filled
her
was
what
her
friends
them
with
the
new
testament
and
begged
them
to
read
it
and
to
love
the
saviour
several
of
these
ladies
were
converted
especially
those
whom
we
have
named
claudine
who
was
their
of
life
and
charity
pressed
them
to
adopt
a
christian
conduct
aside
your
great
display
she
said
to
them
yourselves
simply
and
without
superfluity
and
give
your
minds
to
great
charities
faith
holds
the
first
place
but
after
that
come
good
works
from
that
time
indeed
these
women
showed
great
compassion
for
the
wretched
the
fame
of
their
good
deeds
spread
abroad
and
the
gospel
was
honoured
by
them
it
seemed
admitted
that
no
one
could
be
a
christian
he
had
some
poor
persecuted
foreigner
in
his
such
was
the
christianity
of
geneva
at
the
moment
when
it
was
beginning
to
appear
and
such
it
remained
for
two
centuries
aimé
levet
who
was
at
first
strongly
opposed
to
froment
and
the
gospel
gradually
softened
down
the
holiness
and
charity
of
his
wife
made
him
appreciate
the
word
of
god
claudine
won
her
husband
to
the
lord
from
that
time
she
had
more
liberty
and
the
meetings
at
the
croix
being
insufficient
little
assemblies
were
held
at
her
house
or
at
others
when
there
was
no
evangelist
present
capable
of
explaining
the
bible
they
begged
this
pious
christian
woman
to
do
it
saying
one
has
received
from
the
lord
greater
gifts
than
you
claudine
would
then
read
the
scripture
and
set
forth
with
simplicity
the
truths
and
graces
she
had
found
therein
the
reformers
remembered
the
precept
of
paul
your
women
keep
silence
in
the
but
they
added
must
be
understood
of
the
ordinary
charge
for
a
case
may
happen
when
it
will
be
necessary
for
a
woman
to
speak
in
public
ere
long
the
modest
guérin
who
studied
his
bible
day
and
night
and
other
christians
likewise
took
an
active
part
in
the
work
of
evangelisation
sidenote
church
in
transition
the
church
was
forming
at
first
there
were
a
few
souls
awakened
separately
here
and
there
in
geneva
now
with
the
element
of
individuality
which
is
the
first
was
combined
the
element
of
communion
which
is
not
less
necessary
for
christianity
is
a
leaven
that
the
whole
those
who
had
begun
to
believe
assembled
to
advance
together
in
faith
doubtless
it
was
not
yet
a
church
in
its
complete
state
with
all
its
institutions
believers
even
without
forming
a
church
may
act
upon
one
another
pray
in
common
and
celebrate
the
lord
supper
together
things
ordinarily
begin
in
this
way
this
state
of
transition
the
lawfulness
of
which
must
be
acknowledged
proves
that
the
ecclesiastical
organisation
with
its
ministers
elders
deacons
presbyteries
and
synods
has
not
the
first
place
in
christianity
and
that
the
belongs
to
faith
and
christian
sanctification
this
imperfect
mode
of
existence
is
insufficient
it
has
many
deficiencies
and
is
exposed
to
many
dangers
the
church
should
be
formed
somewhat
later
under
calvin
it
attained
indeed
its
complete
form
in
geneva
it
would
be
foolish
to
deny
man
the
right
of
being
at
first
a
child
but
it
would
be
no
less
so
to
refuse
him
the
right
and
duty
of
becoming
a
man
just
at
this
time
the
evangelicals
received
an
unexpected
help
a
franciscan
coming
from
abroad
began
to
preach
the
advent
sermons
in
the
rive
church
and
this
monk
christopher
bocquet
by
name
happened
to
have
some
inclination
for
the
gospel
being
invited
to
preach
in
a
city
where
two
parties
were
at
war
he
abstained
from
both
superstitions
and
themes
with
many
catholic
at
the
same
time
he
abstained
from
certain
distinctive
doctrines
of
the
reformation
which
he
did
not
quite
understand
and
keeping
to
a
certain
common
ground
of
christianity
he
delivered
sermons
dressed
in
his
brown
frock
and
with
the
cord
round
his
waist
and
humbly
bending
his
head
he
entered
the
cordeliers
church
went
up
into
the
pulpit
and
contemplating
the
mixed
crowd
before
him
proclaimed
to
all
a
saviour
who
had
come
not
in
magnificent
array
but
in
gracious
love
and
called
upon
every
heart
to
rejoice
at
his
sight
the
evangelicals
were
edified
and
the
number
of
persons
frequenting
the
church
increased
every
day
but
friar
christopher
hardly
finished
his
sermon
when
the
huguenots
hurried
away
to
froment
where
trumpet
gave
no
uncertain
they
were
not
the
only
persons
who
went
thither
many
catholics
having
heard
the
reformers
say
that
the
monk
and
the
schoolmaster
preached
fundamentally
the
same
things
followed
the
crowd
going
to
the
croix
and
some
of
them
took
a
liking
for
what
they
heard
thus
the
people
were
more
and
more
enlightened
the
evangelicals
met
sometimes
at
one
house
sometimes
at
another
they
read
and
discussed
the
little
tracts
that
were
sent
them
but
above
all
applied
themselves
to
holy
scripture
it
was
there
only
that
these
simple
christians
were
willing
to
seek
the
light
which
their
consciences
needed
us
specially
study
the
sacred
writings
they
said
order
that
we
may
distinguish
in
religion
what
comes
from
god
from
that
which
men
have
added
to
it
the
genevans
retired
from
these
meetings
strengthened
and
full
of
joy
and
their
love
for
the
word
of
god
continued
to
increase
if
the
reformation
met
with
faithful
adherents
in
geneva
it
also
encountered
resolute
adversaries
the
astonished
and
bewildered
priests
seemed
to
sleep
contenting
themselves
with
a
war
of
trifles
they
made
no
active
and
combined
opposition
to
the
evangelical
movement
it
was
the
laity
who
uttered
the
cry
of
alarm
angry
at
the
inactivity
of
the
clergy
they
gave
the
signal
of
a

thomas
moine
was
at
their
decided
impetuous
man
a
fluent
speaker
and
one
who
had
attained
great
consideration
in
the
romish
party
he
complained
that
they
had
permitted
the
enemy
to
establish
himself
little
by
little
in
the
ancient
episcopal
city
he
said
that
it
was
time
to
wake
up
and
reproached
the
genevese
ecclesiastics
for
their
cowardice
moine
did
not
speak
in
vain
sidenote
sermon
at
the
madeleine
the
vicar
of
la
madeleine
touched
by
his
words
determined
to
exalt
the
honour
of
his
church
and
corporation
and
gave
notice
that
he
would
preach
against
the
heretical
schoolmaster
and
the
foreign
preacher
the
large
area
was
soon
filled
with
fervent
catholics
among
whom
were
some
of
the
reformed
in
particular
chautemps
claude
bernard
salomon
and
perrin
the
vicar
praised
the
catholic
apostolic
roman
church
extolled
its
head
who
was
he
said
the
representative
of
god
and
defended
its
worship
and
institutions
then
having
praised
the
fold
he
described
the
that
prowled
around
it
to
devour
the
sheep
he
accused
froment
of
ignorance
and
falsehood
and
conjured
his
hearers
not
to
throw
themselves
into
the
paws
of
wild
beasts
thieves
and
robbers
on
leaving
the
church
the
four
huguenots
who
had
heard
him
met
to
inquire
what
was
to
be
done
these
men
who
at
the
first
moment
had
like
the
others
given
so
bad
a
reception
to
the
schoolmaster
had
been
touched
three
of
them
at
least
by
the
simple
preaching
of
the
gospel
the
bible
as
we
have
seen
had
become
their
court
of
appeal
which
grieved
the
priests
who
dared
not
deny
the
divinity
of
the
book
but
as
they
had
never
studied
it
were
much
embarrassed
to
find
the
proof
of
their
dogmas
in
it
after
some
deliberation
chautemps
and
his
friends
waited
upon
the
vicar
they
said
a
good
and
learned
man
you
say
that
he
has
lied
prove
it
by
scripture
the
vicar
having
consented
the
huguenots
demanded
that
the
discussion
should
take
place
in
public
so
that
all
might
profit
by
it
but
the
priest
desired
it
to
be
held
at
the
parsonage
the
champions
of
the
reformation
gave
way
and
arrangements
were
made
for
the
disputation
to
take
place
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
the
poor
priest
claude
pelliez
by
name
was
greatly
embarrassed
he
retired
to
his
room
took
up
the
vulgate
which
he
did
not
often
open
and
began
to
look
for
passages
to
oppose
to
the
reformed
doctrines
but
he
searched
in
vain
he
could
find
none
sidenote
a
controversy
in
the
afternoon
of
the
december
sylvester
day
chautemps
bernard
perrin
and
salomon
went
to
the
parsonage
of
the
madeleine
wearing
their
swords
as
was
customary
some
priests
whom
the
curate
had
invited
were
already
there
but
they
had
to
wait
for
the
champion
of
romanism
who
had
not
yet
been
able
to
find
a
single
text
the
four
huguenots
took
off
their
belts
threw
their
swords
on
the
bed
and
sitting
round
the
table
with
the
priests
began
to
talk
familiarly
together
at
last
the
vicar
who
had
had
some
trouble
to
tear
himself
away
from
his
folios
in
which
he
still
hoped
to
find
something
appeared
with
a
bulky
volume
under
his
arm
the
huguenots
rose
as
he
entered
beneath
the
table
at
which
they
were
sitting
stood
some
which
they
and
the
priests
had
emptied
while
waiting
for
him
and
which
perrin
had
paid
for
the
conference
now
began
the
vicar
opened
his
big
volume
in
which
some
strips
of
paper
indicated
the
places
he
thought
favourable
to
him
and
read
a
long
extract
opposed
to
froment
doctrine
book
is
that
asked
perrin
is
not
a
bible
the
huguenots
added
have
not
been
able
to
find
in
the
bible
one
word
with
which
to
answer
froment
and
laughed
at
him
is
that
you
say
retorted
the
priest
reddening
with
anger
is
the
perpetuæ
in
of
the
illustrious
nicholas
lyra
you
promised
to
refute
froment
out
of
scripture
said
the
priest
the
most
approved
interpreter
the
huguenots
were
determined
not
to
accept
the
commentaries
of
man
as
if
they
were
the
very
word
of
god
the
bible
incorruptible
and
infallible
before
which
all
human
systems
must
fall
was
the
only
authority
is
not
a
good
doctor
said
do
not
keep
your
word
perrin
had
understanding
rather
than
real
piety
he
was
a
lamp
but
it
had
no
oil
haughty
violent
and
headstrong
he
wanted
everything
to
bend
before
him
and
so
did
the
vicar
the
quarrel
grew
hot
and
instead
of
discussing
they
abused
each
other
then
one
of
the
churchmen
having
left
the
room
stealthily
a
band
of
priests
suddenly
entered
with
one
de
la
roche
at
their
head
who
carried
a
naked
sword
which
he
pointed
in
front
of
him
said
claude
bernard
came
in
good
faith
we
four
only
to
your
house
to
discuss
we
have
drunk
with
your
friends
we
have
thrown
our
swords
on
the
bed
and
you
traitorously
send
for
an
armed
band
of
priests
it
is
a
trap
with
these
words
the
four
citizens
grasped
their
swords
made
a
way
through
their
opponents
got
out
into
the
street
and
held
their
ground
ready
to
defend
themselves
one
of
the
priests
ran
to
the
belfry
of
the
madeleine
and
began
to
ring
the
tocsin
thus
ended
the
first
theological
dispute
at
geneva
sidenote
tumult
at
the
madeleine
it
was
about
time
favourable
for
a
riot
on
hearing
the
church
bell
the
city
was
thrown
into
commotion
and
everybody
hurried
to
the
spot
it
was
said
that
the
huguenots
desired
to
get
possession
of
the
building
so
that
the
schoolmaster
might
preach
in
it
priests
came
forward
with
their
adherents
to
defend
the
sanctuary
huguenots
took
up
arms
to
protect
their
brethren
hemmed
in
in
front
of
the
church
said
the
friends
of
peace
priests
are
ringing
the
tocsin
and
thus
exciting
the
citizens
to
kill
one
another
the
four
huguenots
with
drawn
swords
and
their
backs
to
the
wall
prepared
to
give
the
churchmen
a
warm
reception
while
their
friends
as
they
arrived
drew
up
by
their
side
the
tumult
was
general
us
close
in
to
the
church
said
the
priests
who
wished
to
surround
it
to
prevent
the
evangelicals
from
entering
huguenots
and
catholics
hastened
from
every
quarter
to
the
madeleine
terror
seized
the
most
timid
the
poor
ladies
of
claire
who
were
at
dinner
hearing
the
noise
rose
from
the
table
in
alarm
and
exclaiming
they
have
threatened
to
marry
us
they
are
going
to
put
their
abominable
plot
into
execution
made
a
procession
round
their
church
and
garden
with
great
devotion
and
many
tears
just
at
this
time
the
council
broke
up
and
two
of
the
syndics
ramel
and
savoie
who
were
going
home
had
to
pass
through
the
midst
of
the
riot
the
two
parties
were
on
the
point
of
coming
to
blows
the
syndics
advanced
checked
the
combatants
by
interposing
their
official
staves
and
ordered
them
to
lay
down
their
arms
which
was
done
was
neither
violence
nor
bloodshed
but
all
was
not
ended
some
members
of
the
chapter
and
several
priests
hearing
that
a
fight
was
going
on
at
the
madeleine
had
collected
in
the
rue
des
chanoines
where
william
canal
incumbent
of
germain
harangued
them
the
catholic
faith
is
threatened
the
throne
of
the
pope
is
shaken
the
great
honour
due
to
mary
is
endangered
we
must
fall
upon
those
who
impugn
it
and
free
the
city
from
their
persons
and
their
errors
such
was
the
sum
of
his
discourse
the
tumult
being
quieted
round
the
church
the
lieutenant
of
justice
châteauneuf
had
turned
towards
the
rue
des
chanoines
where
he
had
been
told
that
the
priests
were
in
commotion
finding
them
determined
to
follow
canal
sword
in
hand
to
the
madeleine
he
commanded
them
to
stop
the
priest
of
germain
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
orders
of
a
civil
magistrate
rushed
hastily
towards
the
church
châteauneuf
laid
his
hand
upon
him
when
the
rebellious
parson
turned
round
and
levelled
his
arquebuse
at
that
officer
but
a
friendly
arm
prevented
his
firing
canal
ran
off
and
the
other
priests
dispersed
sidenote
froment
desired
not
to
preach
the
council
reassembled
in
the
evening
each
opinion
was
represented
in
that
body
which
halted
between
two
opinions
after
a
riot
like
that
which
had
just
occurred
it
was
necessary
to
take
certain
precautions
especially
as
the
morrow
was
new
year
day
and
at
such
times
minds
are
more
easily
excited
the
council
summoned
the
principal
friends
of
the
reform
and
froment
also
was
invited
although
the
registers
make
no
mention
of
his
presence
exhort
you
said
the
syndics
make
anthony
froment
cease
from
disputing
and
preaching
as
well
as
the
others
who
teach
in
private
houses
and
we
conjure
you
to
live
as
your
fathers
did
no
one
would
make
any
promise
on
the
contrary
the
reformed
withdrew
saying
will
hear
the
word
of
god
wherever
we
can
nobody
has
a
right
to
hide
it
then
turning
to
froment
they
begged
him
not
to
be
silent
under
such
prohibition
are
constrained
they
said
hear
the
schoolmaster
and
his
friends
because
the
decree
of
the
council
ordering
the
word
of
god
to
be
preached
in
every
parish
has
not
been
observed
the
reformed
while
desiring
before
all
things
to
obey
god
put
themselves
in
the
right
they
appealed
to
lawful
ordinances
and
this
was
the
ground
which
they
intended
keeping
the
council
acknowledging
that
this
position
of
the
evangelicals
was
impregnable
sent
for
the
abbot
of
bonmont
the
and
begged
him
to
detain
at
geneva
the
cordelier
who
had
preached
the
advent
so
well
and
to
press
the
dominicans
also
to
provide
a
preacher
calculated
to
edify
their
congregation
they
required
further
that
there
should
be
true
preachers
of
the
word
of
god
in
every
parish
the
being
a
peaceful
man
promised
everything
even
to
punishing
canal
the
priest
the
tumult
was
appeased
but
great
agitation
still
reigned
in
minds
some
saw
that
the
storm
was
over
others
that
it
might
easily
break
out
again
as
it
was
sylvester
eve
there
were
numerous
meetings
throughout
the
city
catholics
and
huguenots
being
equally
excited

the
sermon
at
the
molard
new
year
day
for
nearly
twenty
years
liberty
had
been
clearing
the
ground
on
which
the
gospel
was
to
raise
its
temple
for
nearly
eight
years
a
few
pious
voices
had
spoken
of
the
doctrine
of
salvation
in
private
conversations
and
meetings
but
the
reformation
had
not
yet
been
preached
in
the
face
of
the
people
the
hour
that
was
to
make
it
a
public
and
notorious
thing
was
about
to
strike
the
world
was
about
to
witness
the
birth
of
the
principles
of
that
moral
power
which
for
two
centuries
whatever
may
have
been
the
meanness
of
its
origin
has
influenced
the
destinies
of
christendom
which
fanning
the
flame
that
is
to
say
inspiring
the
friends
of
the
reformation
with
heavenly
courage
has
waged
heroic
battles
against
the
jesuits
and
the
inquisition
and
preserved
the
gospel
and
liberty
from
dangerous
assaults
geneva
was
about
to
hear
the
voice
of
a
protestant
sidenote
a
new
year
the
last
night
of
the
year
had
passed
away
and
first
of
was
beginning
in
every
house
relations
and
friends
were
greeting
the
new
year
which
the
reformed
hoped
would
be
better
than
all
that
had
gone
before
the
family
congratulations
being
over
they
went
to
church
bocquet
was
again
preaching
at
the
gray
friar
monastery
where
many
evangelicals
attended
but
the
monk
had
hardly
finished
when
numbers
of
his
hearers
quitted
the
chapel
and
hurried
eagerly
along
the
rue
de
rive
to
the
croix
there
were
many
curious
persons
among
them
who
knowing
that
the
council
had
prohibited
froment
preaching
were
all
the
more
desirous
of
hearing
him
in
a
moment
the
hall
was
filled
then
the
stairs
and
passage
and
at
last
the
street
in
front
of
the
house
froment
arrived
with
a
few
friends
and
seeing
the
crowd
observed
streets
are
so
full
that
it
is
quite
a
crush
he
tried
however
to
make
his
way
through
the
mass
and
his
friends
assisted
him
but
do
what
he
would
all
his
exertions
were
ineffectual
was
all
this
unforeseen
or
was
it
premeditated
by
some
of
the
huguenots
were
these
energetic
men
determined
at
last
to
bring
the
evangelist
from
his
narrow
schoolroom
and
force
him
to
preach
in
public
is
there
not
some
truth
in
sister
jeanne
statement
that
on
the
evening
before
they
had
desired
to
make
him
preach
in
the
large
area
of
the
madeleine
and
may
we
not
believe
that
as
they
did
not
succeed
then
they
now
desired
to
compensate
themselves
by
taking
a
still
larger
space
and
making
the
reformer
preach
in
the
open
air
these
suppositions
appear
probable
but
there
is
no
decided
evidence
in
their
favour
at
all
events
the
crowd
recognized
froment
and
saw
that
he
could
not
reach
the
usual
place
of
his
ministrations
those
who
were
in
the
street
perceived
that
if
the
evangelist
succeeded
in
entering
the
croix
they
would
be
left
outside
which
was
not
agreeable
to
them
one
man
shouted
out
the
molard
and
in
a
short
time
the
cry
became
general
the
molard
to
the
molard
sidenote
froment
at
the
molard
the
molard
was
situated
in
the
most
populous
quarter
of
the
city
near
the
lake
and
the
rhone
it
was
a
large
square
about
yards
from
the
croix
froment
hesitated
but
the
crowd
getting
into
motion
carried
him
along
with
them
towards
the
corner
of
the
square
where
the
fish
market
is
still
held
the
fishwomen
were
there
with
their
fresh
wares
displayed
on
their
stalls
the
huguenots
finding
no
other
pulpit
took
one
of
these
stalls
and
invited
froment
to
get
on
it
he
was
determined
like
his
master
farel
to
preach
the
truth
in
every
place
as
soon
as
his
head
appeared
above
the
others
the
multitude
that
filled
the
square
manifested
their
delight
and
those
around
him
shouted
louder
than
ever
to
us
preach
the
word
of
god
to
us
froment
who
was
moved
answered
with
a
loud
voice
is
also
the
word
that
shall
endure
for
ever
the
tumult
was
so
great
that
the
preacher
could
not
make
himself
heard
made
a
sign
to
them
with
his
hand
to
keep
silence
and
they
were
still
to
god
with
me
he
said
and
then
getting
off
the
stall
he
knelt
upon
the
ground
he
was
agitated
the
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
a
deep
silence
prevailed
in
that
square
which
was
so
often
in
those
days
the
scene
of
tumultuous
movements
some
knelt
others
remained
standing
all
heads
were
uncovered
and
even
those
who
were
strangers
to
the
gospel
appeared
thoughtful
froment
joined
his
hands
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
speaking
so
distinctly
that
all
could
hear
him
he
said
sidenote
prayer
at
the
molard
god
father
of
all
mercies
thou
hast
promised
thy
children
to
give
them
whatsoever
they
shall
ask
in
faith
and
wilt
refuse
them
nothing
that
is
reasonable
and
just
and
hast
always
heard
the
prayers
of
thy
servants
who
are
oppressed
in
divers
manners
thou
knowest
now
what
is
the
need
of
this
people
better
than
they
or
i
do
this
need
is
principally
to
hear
thy
word
it
is
true
we
have
been
ungrateful
in
not
acknowledging
thee
as
our
only
father
and
thine
own
son
jesus
christ
whom
thou
hast
sent
to
die
for
us
in
order
to
be
our
only
saviour
and
intercessor
but
lord
thou
hast
promised
us
that
whensoever
the
poor
sinner
draws
near
thee
by
reason
of
thy
son
born
of
the
virgin
mary
thou
wilt
hear
him
we
know
and
even
are
assured
that
thou
desirest
not
the
death
and
destruction
of
sinners
but
that
they
should
be
converted
and
live
thou
desirest
that
they
should
not
remain
under
the
great
tyranny
of
antichrist
and
under
the
hand
of
the
devil
and
his
servants
who
are
continually
fighting
against
thy
holy
word
and
destroying
thy
work
our
father
look
down
upon
thy
poor
blind
people
led
by
the
blind
so
that
they
both
fall
into
the
ditch
and
can
only
be
lifted
out
by
thy
mercy
lift
them
out
by
thy
holy
spirit
open
their
eyes
their
ears
their
understandings
their
hearts
in
order
that
confessing
their
sins
they
may
look
to
the
goodness
of
thy
son
whom
thou
hast
given
to
die
for
them
and
since
it
hath
pleased
thee
lord
to
send
me
to
them
give
both
them
and
me
the
infinite
grace
that
by
thy
holy
spirit
they
may
receive
what
thou
shalt
put
into
the
mouth
of
thy
servant
who
is
unworthy
to
be
the
bearer
of
so
great
a
message
but
as
it
hath
pleased
thee
to
choose
me
from
among
the
weak
things
of
the
world
give
me
strength
and
wisdom
so
that
thy
power
may
be
manifested
not
only
in
this
city
but
in
all
the
world
how
can
thy
servant
stand
in
the
presence
of
such
a
multitude
of
adversaries
unless
thou
art
pleased
to
strengthen
him
show
then
that
thy
power
is
greater
than
satan
and
that
thy
strength
is
not
like
man
strength
froment
concluded
with
the
lord
prayer
sidenote
sermon
at
the
molard
the
people
were
touched
they
had
often
heard
the
mechanical
prayers
of
the
priests
but
not
a
prayer
of
the
heart
they
acknowledged
that
the
reformers
were
certainly
not
partisans
but
christians
who
desired
the
salvation
of
all
men
the
evangelist
rose
and
stood
once
more
upon
the
stall
which
was
about
to
become
the
first
pulpit
of
the
reformation
in
geneva
he
had
heard
of
the
proceedings
of
the
vicars
of
the
madeleine
and
germain
and
was
moved
by
the
furious
opposition
of
the
priests
to
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
he
had
their
swords
and
arquebuses
still
before
his
eyes
and
resolved
to
oppose
them
with
the
sword
of
the
spirit
which
is
the
word
of
god
it
was
necessary
to
lead
the
genevans
away
from
the
teachers
who
deceived
them
and
direct
them
to
scripture
it
was
necessary
to
break
with
the
papacy
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
they
saw
him
take
a
was
the
gospel
he
opened
it
at
the
seventh
chapter
of
matthew
and
read
these
words
of
false
prophets
which
come
to
you
in
sheep
clothing
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
wolves
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
then
fixing
his
eyes
on
his
numerous
audience
froment
began
by
expressing
his
faith
in
the
mysteries
of
god
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
very
god
and
very
man
conceived
of
the
holy
ghost
and
born
of
the
virgin
mary
knowing
the
things
that
were
to
happen
foresaw
that
false
prophets
would
come
not
with
hideous
faces
but
with
the
most
pleasing
exterior
in
the
world
under
the
colour
of
holiness
and
in
so
that
the
children
of
god
might
be
deceived
for
this
cause
he
exhorted
his
disciples
to
be
as
serpents
and
harmless
as
our
god
does
not
desire
to
have
a
foolish
giddy
people
but
a
people
endowed
with
great
wisdom
who
can
distinguish
between
the
doctrine
of
god
and
the
doctrine
of
man
they
who
do
not
know
it
go
astray
and
are
like
swine
which
can
not
discern
good
things
from
bad
and
swallow
everything
indiscriminately
ah
if
the
serpent
which
is
but
a
brute
is
so
wise
in
his
generation
if
he
shuts
his
ears
so
as
not
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
charmer
if
he
casts
off
his
old
skin
when
the
time
for
doing
so
has
come
shall
we
not
fear
to
follow
the
doctrines
of
men
shall
we
not
cast
off
our
old
skin
to
put
on
a
new
one
yes
we
must
put
off
our
old
nature
which
is
sin
satan
idolatry
impurity
robbery
hypocrisy
pride
avarice
and
false
doctrine
and
put
on
the
new
man
which
is
christ
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
hear
the
word
of
the
gospel
if
we
did
not
change
our
wicked
intentions
and
to
distinguish
the
false
teachers
if
we
did
not
avoid
them
what
if
we
recognized
venomous
beasts
should
we
live
among
them
if
we
saw
a
dish
of
poison
should
we
not
beware
of
eating
it
christ
desires
us
further
to
be
as
not
with
the
simplicity
of
monastic
hypocrisy
or
bigotry
but
with
simplicity
of
heart
without
gall
lovely
as
that
of
doves
if
we
walk
in
such
simplicity
we
shall
overcome
all
our
enemies
as
jesus
christ
overcame
his
enemies
by
his
meekness
let
us
not
begin
fighting
killing
and
burning
as
tyrants
do
the
child
of
god
has
no
other
sword
of
defence
than
the
word
of
god
but
that
is
a
sword
piercing
even
to
the
marrow
everybody
understood
froment
allusion
and
many
as
they
thought
of
the
riot
of
the
evening
before
looked
and
smiled
at
each
other
but
while
these
words
delivered
with
energy
were
stirring
the
crowd
assembled
in
the
molard
there
was
still
greater
agitation
in
the
rest
of
the
city
the
priests
were
irritated
they
had
tried
to
shut
froment
schoolroom
and
now
he
was
preaching
in
the
great
square
they
went
from
one
to
another
and
excited
the
laity
lutherans
they
said
taken
their
to
the
molard
to
make
him
preach
there
the
being
instructed
by
them
apprised
the
syndics
who
sent
for
the
chief
usher
falquet
and
ordered
him
to
stop
the
preaching
that
officer
immediately
went
down
to
the
molard
the
sergeants
cleared
a
way
through
the
crowd
and
going
up
to
froment
who
was
then
speaking
with
great
boldness
he
stretched
out
his
staff
towards
him
and
said
the
name
of
my
lords
i
command
you
to
cease
preaching
froment
stopped
and
turning
to
the
chief
usher
answered
him
in
a
loud
voice
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
god
commands
me
to
preach
his
word
you
forbid
it
i
am
therefore
not
bound
to
obey
you
the
presence
of
the
public
force
caused
however
some
little
sensation
in
the
audience
the
evangelist
noticing
it
turned
to
the
people
and
said
not
be
disturbed
my
friends
but
listen
to
what
our
lord
we
must
beware
of
false
prophets
silence
was
restored
everyone
became
calm
and
falquet
finding
the
evangelist
was
determined
to
preach
thought
it
the
safest
plan
to
refer
to
his
masters
and
withdrew
with
his
officers
froment
then
continued
his
discourse
order
to
be
on
our
guard
against
false
prophets
we
must
know
what
they
are
what
is
their
doctrine
and
life
and
with
what
they
are
clothed
when
they
have
been
described
to
you
in
their
natural
colours
you
will
avoid
their
teaching
and
their
life
as
more
deadly
than
the
plague
the
plagues
with
which
god
has
visited
you
heretofore
only
touched
you
outwardly
but
this
more
venomous
than
all
the
other
poisons
of
the
earth
infects
the
soul
kills
it
and
casts
it
into
perdition
with
this
plague
we
and
our
fathers
have
been
infected
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
not
that
it
came
upon
us
suddenly
and
in
villanous
and
deformed
appearance
no
it
came
gradually
under
the
colour
of
holiness
and
in
sheep
clothing
these
ravening
wolves
having
even
some
good
intentions
but
although
jesus
christ
had
warned
us
of
their
coming
and
had
pointed
them
out
to
us
we
have
been
blinded
and
led
by
the
nose
to
the
ditch
of
deceit
like
cattle
to
water
the
son
of
perdition
who
sitting
in
the
temple
of
god
is
worshipped
as
you
worship
and
keep
his
commandments
oh
what
a
fine
master
you
serve
and
what
prophets
you
have
do
you
know
them
not
to
keep
you
in
suspense
i
declare
openly
that
i
am
speaking
of
the
pope
and
that
the
false
prophets
of
whom
i
bid
you
beware
are
the
priests
monks
and
all
the
rest
of
his
train
some
of
you
who
yourselves
belong
to
that
band
will
say
it
is
you
that
are
the
false
prophets
our
law
is
old
and
yours
is
but
of
yesterday
and
brings
confusion
among
the
people
of
every
country
while
our
friends
reigned
we
enjoyed
so
much
good
so
many
happy
years
that
it
was
quite
marvellous
but
since
you
have
come
to
preach
this
new
law
there
have
been
wars
famines
pestilences
divisions
strifes
and
certainly
you
are
not
from
god
let
us
examine
this
statement
let
us
find
out
who
are
these
false
or
your
priests
in
order
to
discriminate
in
such
a
matter
the
two
parties
ought
to
have
a
competent
judge
who
is
no
acceptor
of
persons
and
that
the
parties
should
not
be
judges
in
their
own
cause
for
if
in
civil
causes
we
need
good
judges
good
pleadings
good
witnesses
good
reasons
and
letters
patent
how
much
more
so
in
the
things
of
god
we
shall
take
therefore
a
competent
judge
and
shall
produce
witnesses
documents
and
ancient
customs
for
the
defence
of
our
right
curiosity
was
excited
the
hearers
asked
each
other
what
was
the
name
hitherto
the
pope
had
been
appealed
to
as
sole
judge
of
controversies
who
was
froment
going
to
put
in
his
place
the
first
place
he
continued
judge
shall
yes
god
who
judges
with
righteous
judgment
not
regarding
either
rich
or
poor
wise
or
foolish
and
who
gives
right
to
whom
it
belongs
judge
shall
be
his
true
son
jesus
christ
attended
by
his
good
and
lawful
witnesses
the
prophets
and
apostles
and
here
said
he
holding
up
the
new
testament
and
showing
it
to
the
people
are
the
sealed
letters
signed
with
the
precious
blood
of
our
lord
and
the
cloud
of
martyrs
who
were
put
to
death
in
order
to
bear
this
testimony
what
read
we
there
the
lord
condemns
the
pharisees
as
now
do
you
not
think
that
yours
the
romish
priests
are
condemned
by
him
those
who
call
themselves
saints
through
their
own
merits
the
only
saints
of
the
church
and
who
wish
to
lead
you
by
their
bulls
pardons
auricular
confessions
masses
and
other
tricks
or
manœuvres
which
they
have
invented
out
of
their
own
heads
which
the
pharisees
never
dared
do
the
lord
in
matthew
bears
this
testimony
there
shall
arise
false
prophets
in
the
latter
days
who
will
say
unto
you
here
is
christ
or
do
they
not
tell
you
that
christ
is
there
in
the
inner
part
of
the
holy
house
hidden
in
the
farthest
place
a
do
not
believe
them
the
true
christ
is
he
who
hath
ransomed
us
with
his
blood
seek
him
by
a
real
faith
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
and
not
in
a
house
in
a
cupboard
in
the
pyx
as
your
new
redeemers
and
do
what
says
jesus
christ
for
the
fuller
identification
of
the
false
prophets
he
not
only
says
that
they
come
in
sheep
clothing
but
that
walk
in
long
robes
devour
widows
houses
and
for
a
show
make
long
the
lord
does
not
forbid
wearing
long
robes
for
the
necessities
of
the
body
but
the
hypocritical
superstitions
connected
with
them
the
wearers
esteeming
themselves
holier
than
the
laity
by
being
dressed
shaven
and
shorn
differently
from
us
yes
by
such
means
they
have
devoured
widows
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
they
eat
women
it
is
a
manner
of
speaking
as
we
say
of
tyrants
that
they
devour
their
people
and
of
lawyers
that
they
devour
their
clients
that
is
to
say
their
substance
and
not
that
they
eat
men
flesh
as
the
cannibals
do
break
their
to
get
at
the
marrow
says
a
prophet
eat
the
flesh
of
my
people
as
flesh
within
the
now
o
people
i
pray
you
and
judge
for
yourselves
tell
us
who
are
those
who
wear
such
clothing
such
who
making
long
prayers
for
show
you
know
very
well
it
is
not
us
for
we
are
dressed
like
other
people
but
if
your
priests
were
to
dress
like
us
they
would
be
apostate
and
excommunicate
more
we
do
not
lead
poor
people
to
understand
that
they
ought
to
bring
us
a
portion
of
their
goods
and
that
then
we
will
save
them
that
praying
for
them
and
the
dead
we
will
bring
them
out
of
purgatory
but
your
priests
do
so
and
under
such
pretexts
they
have
dragged
into
their
paws
almost
all
the
riches
of
the
earth
and
not
a
word
must
be
said
about
it
for
whosoever
speaks
of
it
will
suddenly
be
put
to
death
or
be
excommunicated
or
called
heretic
and
lutheran
jesus
christ
paul
and
the
other
apostles
paint
them
so
truly
to
the
life
that
there
is
no
one
so
blind
or
stupid
as
not
to
recognise
them
easily
except
those
who
are
afraid
of
losing
their
the
holy
scriptures
call
them
wells
without
water
despisers
of
the
lord
and
say
that
they
heed
to
doctrines
of
devils
forbidding
to
marry
and
commanding
to
abstain
from
meats
which
god
hath
created
to
be
received
with
thankfulness
of
them
which
while
froment
was
thus
haranguing
the
people
in
the
molard
the
magistrates
assembled
in
the
learnt
from
the
chief
usher
that
the
sermon
was
still
going
on
the
syndics
were
exasperated
the
canons
and
priests
argued
that
as
the
civil
power
was
helpless
they
ought
to
take
the
matter
into
their
own
hands
and
grasping
their
arms
prepared
to
descend
at
the
same
time
the
council
being
resolved
to
make
an
example
ordered
the
preachers
to
be
apprehended
wherever
they
were
found
and
consequently
the
lieutenant
of
police
the
with
sergeants
soldiers
and
priests
marched
in
a
large
body
to
the
molard
angry
and
indignant
at
the
boldness
and
determined
to
throw
him
into
prison
if
farel
had
been
placed
beyond
their
reach
froment
at
least
should
not
escape
while
this
excited
band
was
descending
the
perron
with
deadly
intentions
froment
who
either
had
no
suspicion
or
did
not
care
about
it
was
continuing
his
discourse
to
the
people
of
geneva
are
many
other
passages
of
scripture
he
said
might
be
brought
forward
for
a
stronger
proof
but
these
must
suffice
to
put
you
in
a
position
to
judge
whether
we
or
your
pastors
are
false
prophets
there
is
none
among
you
who
does
not
know
that
we
do
not
forbid
marriage
or
meats
that
we
declare
marriage
holy
ordained
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
all
such
as
have
not
the
gift
of
continence
without
any
distinction
of
persons
but
the
pope
does
otherwise
and
says
that
he
who
hath
not
a
lawful
wife
may
keep
a
concubine
xxxiv
cap
xvi
non
habet
uxorem
loco
illius
concubinam
habere
for
he
adds
i
desire
that
they
be
holy
verily
a
wonderful
holiness
is
that
i
make
you
all
judges
you
have
long
known
them
better
than
i
have
for
meats
we
leave
every
man
free
as
our
lord
has
done
exhorting
the
people
to
use
them
profitably
without
excess
or
superfluity
giving
thanks
to
god
but
these
do
the
very
opposite
although
christ
was
sent
by
the
father
to
teach
us
the
truth
they
bring
us
lies
dreams
false
doctrines
prohibitions
of
marriage
and
of
meats
and
all
sorts
of
nonsense
as
if
they
were
holy
sidenote
the
sermon
interrupted
at
this
moment
a
confused
noise
was
heard
claude
bernard
whose
eyes
and
ears
were
on
the
watch
perceived
a
band
of
armed
men
entering
the
square
the
lieutenant
of
the
city
the
the
soldiers
and
the
armed
priests
exasperated
and
impatient
were
occupying
the
molard
bernard
saw
that
resistance
would
be
dangerous
and
useless
besides
the
reformation
must
not
be
established
in
geneva
by
violence
it
must
make
its
way
by
conviction
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
every
one
knew
what
would
be
the
fate
of
the
evangelist
if
he
were
taken
he
must
be
saved
bernard
therefore
sprang
from
his
place
and
rushed
great
excitement
towards
froment
shouting
to
him
at
the
top
of
his
voice
are
all
the
priests
in
arms
the
and
the
lieutenant
of
the
city
are
with
them
for
the
honour
of
god
descend
get
off
the
stall
and
let
us
save
your
life
make
your
escape
froment
would
not
come
down
they
entreated
him
in
vain
his
heart
burnt
within
him
for
he
perceived
that
his
discourse
was
stirring
their
souls
how
could
he
forsake
his
work
at
such
a
decisive
moment
but
the
priests
and
arquebusiers
were
coming
nearer
some
of
the
huguenots
were
already
grasping
their
swords
and
preparing
to
resist
the
sacerdotal
gang
there
would
have
been
bloodshed
and
death
for
god
honour
let
us
avoid
the
spilling
of
blood
exclaimed
bernard
froment
could
not
resist
these
words
some
of
his
friends
caught
hold
of
him
lifted
him
off
the
stall
and
dragged
him
away
they
took
him
through
a
narrow
private
passage
and
by
this
means
reached
jean
chautemps
house
the
door
opened
and
the
evangelist
was
put
into
a
secret
the
priests
and
soldiers
vainly
endeavoured
to
reach
him
the
mass
of
hearers
was
between
them
and
him
the
lieutenant
ordered
the
people
heavy
penalties
to
retire
and
when
the
preacher
was
in
safety
the
assembly
dispersed
the
magistrates
and
priests
returned
angry
and
disappointed
to
report
this
second
failure
to
the
syndics
the
word
had
not
been
sown
in
vain
many
of
the
hearers
found
that
they
had
received
a
glorious
new
year
gift
such
was
the
first
day
of
the
year
at
geneva
sidenote
froment
in
hiding
all
the
priests
and
their
followers
had
not
returned
to
the
hotel
de
ville
froment
had
disappeared
but
he
could
not
be
far
off
some
of
them
prowled
about
the
adjacent
streets
trying
to
discover
the
reformer
hiding
place
at
last
one
of
them
found
it
out
chautemps
was
known
to
be
a
decided
evangelist
and
they
called
to
mind
that
olivetan
had
lived
in
his
house
several
catholics
stationed
themselves
under
his
windows
and
when
the
night
came
they
began
to
make
an
uproar
this
alarmed
froment
friends
and
going
to
his
hiding
place
they
told
him
that
must
move
to
the
house
of
another
citizen
they
went
out
by
a
and
owing
to
the
darkness
he
was
conducted
without
being
recognised
to
the
house
of
the
energetic
perrin
who
was
more
dreaded
than
the
honest
chautemps
ere
long
however
the
priests
and
their
adherents
followed
him
there
perrin
they
shouted
will
pull
down
your
house
and
burn
you
in
it
if
you
do
not
send
the
lutheran
away
perrin
made
use
of
stratagem
going
out
to
the
riotous
catholics
he
said
have
liberty
to
keep
an
honest
servant
in
our
houses
without
impediment
from
anybody
he
then
said
to
froment
are
my
servant
i
engage
you
as
such
and
you
shall
work
for
me
at
the
same
time
a
few
of
perrin
friends
stanch
huguenots
came
up
the
street
presenting
such
a
threatening
front
to
the
priests
that
they
were
forced
to
retire
the
syndics
determined
to
convoke
the
great
council
on
the
morrow
the
circumstances
were
serious
the
new
doctrine
had
been
preached
publicly
and
froment
bold
address
had
made
an
impression
especially
on
the
huguenots
they
had
discovered
that
the
surest
means
of
guaranteeing
their
political
emancipation
was
to
establish
a
religious
reformation
at
the
molard
liberty
and
the
gospel
had
shaken
hands
the
catholics
asked
whether
the
pope
sovereignty
was
about
to
fall
to
the
ground
the
various
parties
grew
warm
abused
each
other
and
lively
discussions
took
place
between
them
the
politicians
maintained
that
if
the
city
was
divided
on
such
matters
their
irreconcileable
enemy
savoy
would
plant
his
white
cross
on
the
walls
he
had
coveted
so
long
certain
laymen
full
of
confidence
in
their
own
ability
doubted
whether
strangers
and
madmen
should
be
permitted
to
vent
their
nonsense
everywhere
the
priests
spoke
the
loudest
they
asked
the
genevans
if
they
would
forsake
the
faith
of
their
ancestors
if
the
catholic
and
apostolic
religion
attacked
overthrown
and
annihilated
was
to
give
place
to
a
new
doctrine
that
would
bring
down
the
ruin
of
geneva
the
huguenots
replied
that
if
the
religion
announced
by
the
reformers
was
not
that
of
the
pope
the
schoolmen
the
councils
and
perhaps
even
of
the
fathers
it
was
at
least
that
of
the
apostles
and
jesus
christ
and
consequently
was
older
than
that
of
rome
they
represented
that
as
the
papal
government
was
nothing
else
than
despotism
in
the
church
it
could
produce
nothing
but
despotism
in
the
state
the
two
parties
became
more
distinct
every
day
the
syndics
and
councillors
wishing
to
restore
concord
went
from
one
to
another
trying
to
calm
down
the
more
violent
but
it
was
a
very
hard
task
sidenote
the
council
meets
on
the
of
january
when
the
council
of
two
hundred
met
the
premier
syndic
proposed
it
should
be
forbidden
to
preach
in
private
houses
or
in
public
places
without
the
permission
of
the
syndics
or
the
that
all
who
knew
of
preachers
guilty
of
infringing
this
law
should
be
bound
to
inform
against
them
under
penalty
of
stripes
with
the
at
these
words
the
huguenots
exclaimed
demand
the
holy
scriptures
to
which
the
friends
of
the
priests
replied
desire
that
sect
to
be
utterly
extirpated
the
council
thought
to
restore
harmony
between
everybody
by
carrying
a
resolution
that
bocquet
the
gray
friar
should
preach
until
next
lent
the
premier
syndic
who
was
distressed
at
the
strife
and
hatred
by
which
the
citizens
were
divided
proposed
that
men
citizens
and
inhabitants
should
forgive
one
another
the
genevans
who
were
prompt
to
anger
were
equally
prompt
to
reconciliation
yes
they
exclaimed
as
they
lifted
up
their
hands
desire
to
love
those
who
are
of
a
contrary
opinion
and
soon
bands
of
men
might
be
seen
parading
the
streets
in
which
persons
of
the
most
opposite
opinions
held
one
another
affectionately
by
the
arm
meantime
froment
remained
in
perrin
house
and
wove
ribbons
he
could
not
have
stayed
there
as
he
informs
us
whilst
seated
in
silence
at
the
loom
passing
the
shuttle
to
and
fro
he
deliberated
whether
he
should
remain
in
hiding
or
again
openly
proclaim
the
gospel
having
made
up
his
mind
to
go
from
house
to
house
to
strengthen
those
who
had
believed
he
went
out
and
knocked
at
certain
doors
a
few
of
his
friends
armed
with
stout
sticks
followed
him
at
a
distance
without
his
knowledge
to
prevent
his
being
insulted
one
day
however
a
vulgar
woman
abusing
him
roundly
jean

went
up
and
gave

on

another
time
froment
was
crossing
the
rhone
bridge
to
go
to
aimé
levet
it
was
a
holiday
and
the
priests
at
the
head
of
a
procession
were
advancing
on
one
end
of
the
bridge
as
froment
arrived
at
the
other
they
were
carrying
crosses
and
relics
mumbling
prayers
and
invoking
the
saints
chanted
some
chanted
others
froment
being
taken
by
surprise
and
embarrassed
determined
to
be
moderate
and
not
to
throw
the
saints
into
the
river
as
farel
had
done
at
montbeliard
he
therefore
stood
still
but
did
not
bow
to
the
images
when
they
saw
this
the
priests
left
off
chanting
and
began
to
shout
on
him
fall
on
the
dog
to
the
rhone
with
him
the
devout
women
who
followed
them
breaking
their
ranks
rushed
upon
the
reformer
one
caught
him
by
the
arm
another
by
the
dress
while
a
third
pushed
him
from
behind
the
rhone
with
him
they
cried
and
endeavoured
to
throw
him
into
the
river
but
his
consisting
of
john
humbert
and
some
other
huguenots
who
were
a
little
way
off
ran
up
and
rescued
froment
from
the
hands
of
these
furies
upon
this
the
women
priests
and
sacristans
seeing
that
the
lutherans
had
saved
their
shouted
still
louder
than
before
a
tumultuous
crowd
filled
the
bridge
the
huguenots
wishing
to
put
froment
in
a
place
of
safety
hurriedly
thrust
him
into
levet
house
which
was
situated
at
the
corner
of
the
bridge
the
populace
excited
by
the
clergy
instantly
besieged
the
house
they
flung
stones
at
the
windows
threw
mud
into
the
shop
and
at
last
rushed
in
and
scattered
the
drugs
and
bottles
upon
the
floor
levet
was
an
profession
much
esteemed
the
huguenots
having
put
froment
in
safety
in
a
secret
chamber
went
out
and
assisted
by
a
few
friends
drove
the
priests
women
and
rioters
from
the
bridge
at
night
froment
left
his
and
returned
to
perrin
where
he
assembled
a
few
friends
and
told
them
that
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
leave
the
city
on
account
of
these
tempests
chautemps
perrin
levet
and
guerin
were
much
distressed
but
they
confessed
that
the
violence
of
his
enemies
rendered
the
evangelist
longer
stay
in
geneva
useless
claude
magnin
offered
to
accompany
him
and
when
the
night
came
froment
bade
his
brethren
farewell
proceeding
cautiously
he
quitted
the
city
crossed
the
pays
de
vaud
and
arrived
at
the
village
of
yvonand
where
he
rested
from
his
genevese
battles
froment
was
not
one
of
those
eminent
men
who
play
a
part
because
of
their
great
character
and
whose
influence
is
continually
on
the
increase
his
ministry
at
geneva
during
part
of
the
winter
was
the
heroic
period
of
his
life
after
which
he
seldom
appears
but
in
the
second
or
third
rank
he
was
eclipsed
by
teachers
who
were
superior
to
him
in
the
briefness
of
his
ministry
he
resembles
those
heavenly
bodies
which
attract
all
eyes
for
a
few
weeks
and
then
disappear
but
he
resembles
them
also
by
the
influence
which
the
people
ascribe
to
their
ephemeral

from

to
which

by

and
were
unwittingly
the
instruments
of
a
greater
revolution
than
they

imagined
these
genevans
felt
as
if
by
inspiration
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
society
was
passing
through
a
crisis
and
that
a
new
phase
was
opening
for

did
more
than
observe

they
were
personally
the
chief
actors
in
the
revolution
that
was
about
to
be
accomplished
in
the
world
leaving
the
barren
nations
in
their
lifeless
stagnation
the
men
of
this
little
city
shouted
and
rushed
into
the
arena
froment
had
hardly
left
geneva
before
the
partisans
of
the
reformation
raised
their
heads
the
romish
church
had
on
its
side
the
the
clergy
the
friburgers
and
even
the
majority
of
the
council
and
people
but
if
the
friends
of
reform
were
in
a
minority
as
regards
material
force
they
surpassed
their
adversaries
in
moral
strength
the
historian
asserts
that
from
this
moment
the
two
parties
were
nearly
equal
in
power
the
grey
friar
bocquet
who
managed
with
so
much
address
says
a
manuscript
both
parties
went
to
hear
him
with
equal
eagerness
now
began
to
preach
the
christian
truth
more
openly
the
astonished
priests
were
still
more
exasperated
against
the
monk
than
they
had
been
against
the
reformer
and
solicited
that
he
should
be
silenced
the
hands
of
the
clergy
were
ere
long
strengthened
by
a
powerful
ally
on

six

of

letter

your

the
syndics
answered
to
no
purpose
that
they
desired
to
live
as
their
forefathers
had
done
the
friburgers
made
a
great
disturbance
about
the
grey
friar
sermons
and
the
council
decided
the
love
of
peace
that
bocquet
should
leave
geneva
sidenote
baudichon

the
friends
of
the
gospel
seeing
that
even
the
franciscan
was
taken
from
them
did
not
lose
heart
the
holy
scriptures
remained
they
read
in
their
homes
lefèvre
new
testament
and
formed
meetings
at
which
the
word
of
god
was
explained
the
assemblies
took
place
in
the
houses
here
and
there
were
multiplied
and
the
number
of
believers
increased
every
day
they
met
ordinarily
at
the
end
of
the
rue
des
allemands
at
the
house
of
baudichon
de
la
maisonneuve
who
henceforward
became
a
most
zealous
protestant
sprung
from
a
noble
and
powerful
family
in
the
republic
he
had
a
decided
character
and
some
talent
and
carried
to
extremes
his
convictions
and
his
desire
to
make
them
succeed
individual
life
had
prevailed
during
the
feudal
times
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
social
element
was
growing
stronger
every
day
there
were
however
certain
natures
which
still
maintained
their
independent
individualism
and
baudichon
was
one
of
them
accordingly
so
long
as
it
was
only
a
question
of
destroying
the
old
order
of
things
he
acquitted
himself
valiantly
but
he
was
less
useful
when
it
was
necessary
to
build
up
the
new
order
he
seems
however
to
have
been
aware
of
his
own
insufficiency
his
arms
were
a
house
and
above
the
crest
an
open
hand
with
these
words
the
lord
build
the
house
they
labour
in
vain
that
build
the
lord
did
build
assemblies
were
formed
and
baudichon
house
became
the
says
an
old
author
in
which
the
new
christians
held
their
humble
meetings
they
arrived
saluted
each
other
fraternally
sat
down
in
a
large
room
and
remained
a
few
moments
in
silence
they
knew
that
though
they
were
many
they
had
all
one
sole
mediator
present
in
the
midst
of
them
although
unseen
then
one
of
them
would
read
a
portion
of
scripture
another
of
the
better
informed
explained
and
applied
it
and
a
third
prayed
the
believers
departed
edified
from
their
meetings
were
so
different
they
said
from
the
pope
mass
sometimes
a
great
treat
was
granted
them
some
evangelical
foreigner
passed
through
geneva
the
news
spread
immediately
to
every
family
the
place
and
time
were
named
when
he
would
preach
and
the
believers
flocked
thither
from
every

merely
with
being
taught
sound
doctrine
they
knew
that
a
cold
knowledge
of
god
can
save
no
man
and
that
it
is
necessary
to
live
with
the
spirit
of
christ
and
as
he
lived
they
had
formed
a
fund
among
themselves
and
salomon
was
the
treasurer
every
one
brought
his
mite
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
whether
genevans
or
foreigners
thus
these
christians
learnt
at
once
to
believe
to
love
and
to
give
two
kinds
of
protestantism
were
already
beginning
however
to
appear
in
geneva
which
have
not
ceased
and
perhaps
never
will
cease
to
external
and
an
internal
protestantism
the
pious
and
humble
guerin
had
a
servant
who
full
of
admiration
for
his
master
sermons
was
also
a
great
talker
one
day
wishing
to
do
the
same
as
his
master
he
began
to
preach
in
the
open
street
before
a
number
of
people
do
you
go
to
mass
he
said
are
idolaters
instead
of
worshipping
god
you
adore
a
wafer
the
poor
orator
was
taken
up
and
compelled
to
leave
the
city
in
consequence
of
his
sermon
another
day
some
huguenots
entered
a
pastrycook
shop
it
was
a
saturday
in
lent
they
asked
for
a
plate
of
meat
said
the
master
so
much
ceremony
rudely
returned
the
huguenots
the
pastrycook
ran
off
to
inform
against
them
and
they
were
condemned
to
pay
a
fine
of
sixty
sous
each
which
occasioned
some
disturbance
huguenots
heretics
shouted
one
party
mamelukes
papists
answered
the
other
sidenote
olivetan
work
in
the
midst
of
these
disturbances
the
most
important
work
of
the
reformation
was
progressing
at
geneva
the
pious
olivetan
was
labouring
night
and
day
at
the
translation
of
the
bible
he
believed
that
nothing
was
more
necessary
for
the
church
of
his
time
and
in
his
great
love
for
it
he
determined
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
supply
the
want
poor
little
church
he
said
thou
art
desolate
and
rejected
and
countest
for
the
most
part
in
thy
family
the
blind
the
lame
the
maimed
the
deaf
the
paralytic
orphans
and
strangers
simple
and
foolish
why
should
we
be
ashamed
to
make
thee
such
a
royal
present
do
we
not
all
need
the
consolation
of
christ
for
whom
does
the
lord
destine
his
scripture
if
not
for
his
little
invincible
band
to
whom
as
the
real
leader
of
the
war
he
desires
to
impart
courage
and
boldness
by
his
presence
nothing
disturbed
olivetan
so
much
as
the
sight
of
the
church
of
his
day
the
more
he
studied
it
the
more
he
was
grieved
by
its
misery
and
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
a
total
reformation
accomplished
by
the
word
of
god
never
perhaps
had
its
condition
caused
so
profound
and
keen
a
sorrow
in
any
one
when
he
was
alone
in
his
room
and
seated
at
his
table
these
bitter
recollections
would
recur
to
him
love
thee
he
exclaimed
have
seen
thee
in
the
service
of
thy
hard
masters
i
have
seen
thee
coming
and
going
worried
and
plagued
i
have
seen
thee
ragged
muddy
torn
dishevelled
chilled
bruised
beaten
and
disfigured
i
have
seen
thee
in
such
piteous
case
that
men
would
sooner
take
thee
for
a
poor
slave
than
the
daughter
of
the
universal
ruler
and
the
beloved
of
his
only
son
listen
added
he
friend
calls
thee
he
endeavours
to
teach
thee
thy
rights
and
to
give
thee
the
that
thou
mayest
attain
to
perfect
freedom
stupified
and
bewildered
by
so
many
blows
bowed
down
by
so
many
cares
brought
upon
thee
by
thy
rough
masters
wilt
thou
persevere
wilt
thou
go
thy
ways
and
complete
the
foul
and
grievous
task
with
which
they
have
burdened
thee
sidenote
translation
of
the
bible
but
olivetan
soon
stopped
in
the
midst
of
his
work
and
asked
himself
whether
humble
translator
as
he
calls
himself
was
capable
of
performing
such
a
task
he
looked
upon
himself
as
the
meanest
of
believers
one
of
the
smallest
toes
on
the
lowly
feet
of
the
body
of
the
church
but
his
very
humility
induced
him
to
increase
in
diligence
he
procured
the
best
copies
of
the
scriptures
and
compared
as
he
tells
us
the
translations
ancient
and
modern
from
the
greek
down
to
the
italian
and
german
above
all
he
made
great
use
of
the
french
translation
by
lefèvre
of
etaples
but
rendered
certain
passages
differently
he
studied
the
various
texts
the
use
of
the
masoretic
points
marks
consonants
aspirates
and
unusual
expressions
he
deliberated
whether
he
should
preserve
in
french
certain
greek
terms
such
as
and
or
express
them
by
the
corresponding
word
in
french
i
preserve
the
greek
word
he
said
thing
which
it
signifies
will
remain
unknown
just
as
it
has
been
to
the
present
day
he
therefore
translated
the
greek
word
by
the
french
word
sent
instead
of
he
wrote
overseer
and
elder
instead
of
then
he
added
mischievously
if
any
one
is
surprised
at
not
finding
certain
words
in
my
translation
which
the
common
people
have
continually
on
their
lips
imagining
they
are
in
scripture
such
as
he
must
know
that
i
did
not
find
them
there
and
for
that
reason
i
have
not
changed
them
on
the
march
the
printer
de
vingle
asked
permission
to
print
the
bible
in
french
the
council
was
much
divided
for
the
friends
of
the
clergy
opposed
his
prayer
on
the
one
side
they
called
out
and
on
the
other
the
syndics
thought
it
their
duty
to
steer
a
middle
course
and
granted
permission
to
reprint
lefèvre
bible
without
adding
or
retrenching
a
word
they
were
afraid
of
translation
and
we
shall
see
by
and
by
where
he
was
forced
to
get
it
printed
another
desire
absorbed
the
evangelicals
of
geneva
about
this
time
when
guerin
levet
chautemps
and
others
met
together
in
some
humble
room
they
expressed
the
happiness
they
should
feel
at
assembling
round
the
lord
table
to
commemorate
his
death
they
had
long
ceased
to
take
part
in
the
communion
of
the
romish
church
defiled
as
they
thought
it
by
wretched
superstitions
and
desired
earnestly
to
see
the
lord
supper
among
them
in
its
apostolic
purity
the
christians
of
geneva
asked
for
the
bible
in
the
first
place
and
for
the
sacrament
in
the
second
that
is
in
the
regular
course
the
word
of
god
creates
the
christian
the
lord
supper
strengthens
him
christ
first
imparts
to
his
disciples
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
which
he
does
by
the
ministry
of
the
word
then
he
desires
them
to
understand
that
he
gives
not
only
christian
ideas
to
believers
but
that
he
gives
himself
his
own
he
comes
in
his
own
words
to
in
this
is
the
second
phase
of
faith
and
the
lord
supper
is
its
sign
sidenote
guerin
the
christians
of
geneva
enlightened
by
scripture
desired
the
holy
communion
but
said
they
who
will
give
it
us
they
had
no
ministers
had
not
luther
declared
ten
years
before
that
in
order
to
avoid
irregularity
the
assembly
making
use
of
its
right
ought
to
elect
one
or
more
believers
to
exercise
the
charge
of
the
word
in
the
name
of
all
they
turned
their
eyes
on
guerin
few
of
the
reformed
were
so
much
esteemed
as
he
was
being
an
evangelical
christian
and
not
a
political
huguenot
he
had
ardent
love
for
his
brethren
and
a
zeal
full
of
boldness
to
profess
the
gospel
it
required
some
courage
to
preside
at
the
lord
supper
in
geneva
in
the
presence
of
the
romish
mass
flesh
is
always
cowardly
said
a
christian
of
geneva
pulls
backwards
like
an
aged
ass
and
accordingly
it
needs
the
goad
and
spur
as
much
as
he
does
guerin
possessed
moreover
a
cultivated
understanding
and
was
learned
in
theology
there
remained
one
question
where
should
the
communion
be
held
baudichon
answered
one
of
them
said
the
more
prudent
in
the
city
for
fear
of
the
opposition
of
the
priests
who
are
very
irritated
already
upon
this
stephen
said
have
a
little
walled
garden
near
the
city
gates
where
nobody
can
disturb
us
the
place
was
selected
the
day
named
and
an
hour
fixed
which
would
permit
them
to
meet
without
disturbance
it
was
early
in
the
morning
as
it
would
appear
sidenote
first
sacrament
at
geneva
when
the
day
arrived
many
persons
went
out
of
the
city
and
quietly
directed
their
steps
towards
garden
situated
in
a
place
called
pré
because
the
bishop
had
a
house
there
a
table
had
been
prepared
in
a
room
or
in
the
open
air
the
believers
as
they
arrived
took
their
seats
in
silence
on
the
rude
benches
not
without
fear
that
the
priests
should
get
information
of
the
furtive
meeting
guerin
sat
down
in
front
of
the
table
just
at
the
moment
we
are
told
when
the
ceremony
was
about
to
begin
the
sun
rose
and
illumined
with
his
first
rays
a
scene
more
imposing
in
its
simplicity
than
the
mountains
capped
with
everlasting
snow
above
which
the
star
of
day
was
beginning
his
course
the
pious
guerin
stood
up
and
after
a
prayer
he
distributed
the
bread
and
wine
and
all
together
praised
the
lord
the
communicants
quitted
garden
full
of
gratitude
towards
god
it
was
not
long
however
before
their
peace
was
troubled
their
enemies
could
not
contain
themselves
and
threatened
nothing
less
than
excommunication
and
imprisonment
there
were
disputes
the
priests
shrugged
their
shoulders
at
the
sight
of
those
paltry
assemblies
they
said
that
the
reformed
by
busying
themselves
so
much
about
deprived
themselves
of
the
while
olivetan
and
guerin
maintained
that
the
catholics
by
speaking
so
much
of
the
deprived
themselves
of
the
meeting
of
a
few
souls
endowed
with
a
lively
faith
who
came
to
glorify
jesus
christ
was
they
believed
a
truer
church
than
the
pope
cardinals
and
all
the
pomps
of
the
vatican
the
exasperated
priests
vented
their
anger
specially
on
guerin
and
the
danger
which
threatened
him
was
so
great
that
he
had
to
leave
the
city
hurrying
quickly
away
he
took
refuge
at
yvonand
with
his
friend
froment
from
whom
he
had
received
so
much
enlightenment
thus
farel
froment
and
guerin
were
compelled
one
after
another
to
quit
geneva
but
the
catholics
laboured
in
vain
reformed
met
every
day
in
houses
or
gardens
to
pray
to
god
to
sing
psalms
and
christian
hymns
and
to
explain
holy
scripture
and
the
people
began
to
dispute
with
the
priests
and
to
discuss
with
them
publicly
thus
there
were
two
winds
blowing
in
different
directions
at
from
the
north
the
other
from
the
south
they
could
not
fail
to
come
into
violent
collision
and
to
engender
a
frightful
tempest

who
was
present
during

sermon
could
hardly
contain
himself
but
as
soon
as

he
got
upon

said

some

pushed

he
did
not
escape
so
easily
the

sentenced
him
to
banishment

everyone
regretted
him

they

appeared
before
the
council
and
explained
how
the
clergy
were
endeavouring
to
stifle
the
germs
of
faith
in
their
birth
the
bernese
did
not
hesitate
greatly
irritated
by
the
violence
which
the
genevans
had
used
towards
farel
in
despite
of
their
letters
of
recommendation
they
made
answer
that
they
would
do
everything
to
support
the
gospel
in
geneva
on
the
of
march
the
council
of
geneva
met
there
was
evidently
something
new
many
of
the
members
wore
an
anxious
look
others
appeared
cheerful
du
crest
the
premier
syndic
a
man
devoted
to
the
romish
church
announced
with
an
air
of
consternation
that
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
berne
in
which
the
council
of
geneva
was
severely
reprimanded
in
truth
the
bernese
did
not
mince
matters
they
complained
of
the
violence
done
to
farel
and
the
persecution
organised
in
geneva
against
the
evangelical
faith
are
surprised
they
said
in
your
city
the
faith
in
jesus
christ
and
those
who
seek
it
are
so
molested
you
will
not
suffer
the
word
of
god
to
be
freely
proclaimed
and
banish
those
who
preach
it
this
letter
troubled
the
council
we
concede
what
berne
demands
they
said
priests
will
get
up
fresh
disturbances
if
we
refuse
berne
will
break
off
the
alliance
and
the
reformed
will
revolt
whichever
way
they
turned
danger
seemed
to
threaten
them
that
they
knew
not
what
answer
to
give
adds
the
register
almost
all
of
them
were
enraged
against
maisonneuve
and
salomon
they
were
brought
before
the
council
and
confessed
that
they
had
gone
to
berne
and
had
solicited
the
letter
which
had
been
sent
upon
this
several
mamelukes
called
out
but
the
consciences
of
these
two
noble
citizens
bore
witness
that
they
had
served
the
cause
of
liberty
and
justice
they
remained
firm
and
the
council
being
disturbed
and
undecided
adjourned
to
the
next
day
the
question
of
what
was
to
be
done
the
agitation
spread
from
the
to
the
and
into
the
city
everyone
spoke
about
berne
demand
of
full
liberty
for
the
gospel
the
canons
priests
and
most
devout
of
the
laity
were
unanimous
for
refusing
the
daring
thomas
moine
became
the
soul
of
this
movement
they
resolved
upon
his
proposition
to
intimidate
the
council
and
obtain
from
it
the
total
suppression
of
the
evangelical
meetings
forthwith
the
most
zealous
of
the
party
went
into
the
city
and
visited
from
house
to
house
at
the
same
time
moine
got
a
few
of
his
friends
together
and
proposed
to
go
to
the
council
in
a
body
their
numbers
he
doubted
not
would
overawe
the
syndics
and
the
catholics
would
obtain
their
demands
this
measure
was
resolved
upon
and
the
meeting
fixed
for
the
morrow
sidenote
protest
of
the
two
hundred
next
day
when
the
council
met
they
were
told
that
a
considerable
number
of
citizens
desired
an
audience
they
were
admitted
to
the
number
of
about
two
hundred
including
thomas
moine
faulchon
françois
du
crest
percival
de
pesmes
and
andrew
maillard
their
countenances
bore
the
mark
of
violent
passions
honoured
lords
said
moine
who
was
a
clever
speaker
the
edict
which
bids
us
live
like
brothers
many
persons
are
endeavouring
to
sow
disorder
and
dissension
among
us
some
of
them
have
gone
to
berne
and
the
lords
of
that
place
have
written
you
a
letter
which
disturbs
all
the
city
who
are
those
guilty
men
who
go
and
denounce
their
country
to
the
foreigner
were
they
deputed
by
the
council
what
instructions
did
they
receive
what
answer
did
they
bring
you
we
beg
to
be
informed
on
these
matters
we
wish
to
know
them
and
whether
anything
has
been
done
tending
to
the
ruin
of
the
republic
the
amazed
at
such
a
speech
begged
moine
and
his
friends
to
retire
and
the
embarrassed
council
determined
to
procrastinate
will
do
everything
in
the
world
to
bring
this
difficult
matter
to
a
happy
conclusion
they
answered
will
assemble
the
sixty
the
two
hundred
the
heads
of
families
even
the
general
council
if
necessary
the
whole
republic
rest
content
with
this
promise
have
been
deputed
answered
moine
demand
that
you
should
produce
before
us
those
who
went
to
berne
we
will
not
leave
this
room
until
we
have
seen
them
if
you
do
not
summon
them
we
will
go
and
fetch
them
on
hearing
these
words
the
council
grew
alarmed
what
a
disturbance
and
what
violence
there
would
be
in
the
if
the
two
huguenots
should
appear
before
these
excited
catholics
the
syndics
replied
that
they
would
return
an
answer
this
procrastination
put
the
mamelukes
beside
themselves
it
was
not
moine
alone
who
protested
the
two
hundred
who
surrounded
him
raised
their
hands
and
shouted
in
menacing
tones
justice
let
us
keep
our
promise
to
messieurs
of
geneva
would
preserve
the
faith
of
its
fathers
the
alarmed
syndics
endeavoured
by
exceeding
gentleness
of
manner
says
a
manuscript
to
appease
the
tumult
and
the
two
hundred
discontented
catholics
returned
to
their
homes
with
haughty
look
and
resolute
air
the
council
haggles
any
more
they
said
will
do
ourselves
justice
in
the
city
men
said
thought
the
catholics
decrepid
downcast
asleep
or
dead
but
they
are
opening
their
heavy
eyes
their
strength
is
returning
and
the
vultures
are
about
to
pounce
upon
their
prey
in
fact
two
of
the
syndics
and
several
councillors
with
other
laymen
of
the
catholic
party
and
some
priests
went
into
the
city
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
all
they
met
to
enter
into
the
plot
formed
against
the
gospel
they
told
them
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
expected
from
the
council
the
faith
of
our
fathers
is
to
stand
by
our
own
hands
it
must
be
supported
they
said
yourselves
in
readiness
to
march
against
the
lutherans
sidenote
agitation
against
the
lutherans
the
they
said
it
was
indeed
the
reformation
that
was
then
stirring
up
all
the
wrath
of
the
clerical
party
some
of
its
members
no
doubt
hated
liberty
as
much
as
the
gospel
but
most
of
the
catholics
would
have
tolerated
the
ancient
franchises
of
the
people
the
point
on
which
they
were
all
agreed
was
an
unquenchable
opposition
to
that
new
doctrine
which
they
called
luther
being
in
their
opinion
its
great
apostle
this
lutheranism
was
fundamentally
what
was
afterwards
named
calvinism
for
luther
and
calvin
were
one
in
the
great
evangelical
principles
all
the
reformers
preached
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
europe
and
particularly
at
geneva
that
the
pure
grace
of
god
was
the
only
power
of
eternal
salvation
and
that
the
church
was
composed
of
all
those
who
possessed
true
faith
and
not
of
those
who
slavishly
adhered
to
a
dominating
hierarchy
the
doctrines
of
lutheranism
and
of
the
reform
might
differ
in
regard
to
certain
abstract
questions
as
touching
the
finite
and
the
infinite
for
instance
lutheranism
might
put
in
bolder
relief
the
of
god
while
the
reform
inclined
towards
his
to
use
the
language
of
philosophers
and
theologians
but
they
were
and
they
are
agreed
in
all
that
is
essential
and
it
was
these
living
doctrines
that
a
powerful
party
was
endeavouring
to
expel
from
geneva
sidenote
secret
plots
on
thursday
night
the
canons
priests
and
chief
of
the
papal
religion
as
wernli
de
pesmes
moine
and
their
friends
met
in
the
great
hall
they
arrived
one
after
another
most
of
them
armed
to
the
teeth
and
breathing
vengeance
the
room
was
soon
filled
and
many
stood
in
the
courtyard
their
intention
was
carefully
to
arrange
the
plot
that
was
to
free
them
from
the
reform
some
huguenots
informed
of
the
conspiracy
drew
near
to
watch
their
adversaries
the
circumstances
the
tumultuous
crisis
that
was
approaching
the
interests
to
be
discussed
the
violent
passions
with
which
the
two
parties
were
animated
the
late
hour
at
which
this
conference
was
combined
to
render
it
a
solemn
one
men
minds
became
clouded
and
certain
huguenots
of
ardent
imagination
who
gazed
at
a
distance
upon
the
walls
behind
which
these
plotters
were
assembled
indulging
in
fantastic
visions
fancied
they
saw
the
furies
torch
in
hand
stirring
up
discord
but
they
were
merely
monks
clad
in
their
long
robes
and
holding
the
torches
with
which
the
hall
was
lighted
at
length
the
proceedings
began
some
of
the
speakers
represented
that
the
number
of
rebels
increased
daily
that
the
sacerdotal
authority
decreased
proportionately
and
that
if
things
were
allowed
to
go
on
so
ere
long
nobody
would
take
any
account
of
the
church
us
not
lower
ourselves
to
dispute
with
heretics
let
us
not
wait
for
help
from
the
magistrates
the
council
of
sixty
is
about
to
meet
but
they
will
hesitate
just
like
the
ordinary
council
those
bodies
are
too
weak
we
must
act
without
the
government
we
are
the
strongest
if
it
comes
to
fighting
the
defenders
of
catholicism
will
be
ten
perhaps
twenty
to
one
when
the
evangelists
are
conquered
we
will
invite
the
bishop
back
who
will
return
with
all
the
banished
mamelukes
and
inflict
on
the
rebels
the
punishment
they
deserve
geneva
preserved
from
the
reformation
will
no
longer
be
able
to
spread
it
through
the
surrounding
countries
and
will
be
in
future
ages
the
support
of
the
papacy
let
us
execute
justice
for
ourselves
let
us
fly
to
arms
ring
the
tocsin
draw
the
sword
and
call
upon
the
faithful
to
march
against
those
and
make
a
striking
example
of
the
two
traitors
who
went
to
berne
let
us
kill
all
who
are
called
lutherans
without
sparing
one
which
will
be
doing
god
a
good
service
we
are
assured
of
the
bishop
pardon
his
lordship
has
already
sent
us
the
pardons
in
blank
at
the
sound
of
the
great
bell
let
everyone
go
armed
to
the
molard
and
let
the
city
gates
be
shut
so
that
nobody
may
escape
this
is
what
was
said
in
the
house
the
leaders
agreed
upon
the
place
of
meeting
the
number
of
the
armed
bands
the
names
of
those
who
should
command
them
and
the
manner
in
which
the
reformed
should
be
attacked
everything
was
arranged
the
assembly
applauded
the
conspirators
raising
their
hands
bound
themselves
by
a
solemn
oath
to
execute
the
plan
and
to
secresy
after
which
they
retired
to
take
a
brief
repose
the
festival
of
easter
was
approaching
more
than
two
centuries
before
the
sicilian
vespers
had
filled
palermo
and
all
sicily
with
massacre
the
enemies
of
the
reformation
in
geneva
desired
also
to
celebrate
the
same
festival
with
rivers
of
blood
the
council
of
sixty
met
the
next
day
friday
march
never
perhaps
was
there
a
body
more
divided
when
the
catholics
demanded
that
the
promise
made
to
friburg
should
be
kept
the
huguenots
represented
that
if
the
council
decided
in
favour
of
the
romanist
party
not
only
would
the
bishop
resume
his
former
power
but
that
having
seen
the
reform
on
the
brink
of
triumphing
he
would
throw
himself
into
the
arms
of
savoy
as
the
only
power
capable
of
saving
the
roman
faith
the
council
placed
between
these
two
fierce
currents
remained
in
its
usual
indecision
and
declared
in
favour
of
neither
this
was
just
what
the
leaders
of
the
romanist
party
expected
everything
was
prepared
for
carrying
out
the
to
use
froment
word
which
had
been
planned
the
night
before
sidenote
the
parties
assemble
the
cathedral
had
been
selected
as
the
place
of
meeting
the
first
who
entered
it
was
the
valiant
canon
peter
wernli
he
was
armed
from
head
to
foot
and
advanced
into
the
sanctuary
as
a
general
goes
to
battle
wernli
handled
the
sword
as
well
as
his
brother
who
was
a
captain
in
the
service
of
the
king
of
france
gifted
with
the
strength
of
a
hercules
or
a
samson
he
designed
like
the
first
to
drive
cerberus
out
of
the
city
and
like
the
second
to
pull
down
the
pillars
of
the
temple
he
said
to
those
who
had
gathered
round
him
in
pierre
will
cut
off
the
heads
of
those
who
went
to
berne
and
of
all
their
friends
three
hundred
armed
canons
and
priests
came
after
him
and
then
a
great
number
of
their
lay
followers
lutherans
threaten
us
said
some
of
these
angry
citizens
want
to
rob
the
churches
and
convents
such
a
tale
could
not
fail
to
excite
their
minds
still
more
the
huguenots
informed
of
the
plot
arranged
at
the
and
observing
the
catholics
making
ready
for
the
attack
saw
at
once
that
their
first
act
would
be
to
seize
baudichon
de
la
maisonneuve
on
account
of
his
journey
to
berne
and
inflict
on
him
the
fate
of
berthelier
and
levrier
they
therefore
assembled
to
the
number
of
sixty
around
their
friend
to
defend
his
life
at
the
price
of
their
blood
some
of
moine
partisans
went
to
inform
the
assemblage
at
pierre
that
they
had
seen
several
persons
enter
maisonneuve
house
this
information
was
a
signal
of
battle
to
the
conspirators
they
cried
us
go
and
attack
them
two
catholics
friends
of
peace
who
happened
to
be
in
the
church
faulchon
and
girardin
de
la
rive
fearing
a
civil
war
ran
to
the
council
parties
are
under
arms
they
said
at
pierre
others
at
baudichon
the
first
are
preparing
to
march
down
against
their
opponents
should
they
do
so
there
will
be
a
great
disturbance
look
you
to
it
the
council
suspending
all
other
business
ordered
the
four
syndics
to
proceed
with
the
badges
of
their
office
first
to
pierre
for
the
aggressors
were
there
and
next
to
maisonneuve
and
command
both
parties
to
return
immediately
to
their
homes
the
task
was
a
difficult
one
but
the
four
magistrates
did
not
hesitate
to
undertake
it
preceded
by
their
ushers
they
entered
the
cathedral
with
the
syndical
staff
in
their
hands
at
the
sight
of
them
the
crowd
grew
calm
desire
to
know
said
the
cause
of
this
meeting
the
assembly
answered
with
one
voice
are
going
to
fight
the
lutherans
who
are
assembled
in
the
rue
des
allemands
they
are
always
keeping
us
in
fear
and
we
must
put
an
end
to
it
we
can
no
longer
endure
such
a
pest
in
the
city
they
are
worse
than
the
turks
sidenote
vandel
wounded
at
this
moment
two
of
the
reformed
uneasy
as
to
what
might
happen
approached
the
cathedral
and
mounting
the
steps
before
the
porch
stood
there
some
time
peeping
into
the
church
undecided
whether
they
should
enter
the
priests
and
mamelukes
perceiving
them
exclaimed
at
the
wicked
wretches
they
are
come
to
spy
the
christians
at
last
with
more
zeal
than
prudence
the
two
evangelicals
entered
they
were
goulaz
and
vandel
the
latter
a
man
of
who
had
adopted
the
reform
but
always
retained
a
great
affection
for
his
old
catholic
friends
addressing
the
syndics
with
great
mildness
he
said
put
an
end
to
this
disturbance
lest
worse
should
come
of
it
when
the
mamelukes
heard
his
words
they
became
angry
and
drew
their
swords
to
strike
the
two
huguenots
portier
the
episcopal
secretary
a
violent
and
fanatical
man
seeing
vandel
exclaimed
is
it
that
you
are
here
traitor
several
of
them
rushed
upon
vandel
threw
him
to
the
ground
and
trampled
on
him
portier
drawing
his
dagger
and
seizing
the
young
man
a
cowardly
manner
by
the
back
says
the
council
register
stabbed
him
near
the
left
shoulder
intending
to
kill
him
vandel
lay
seriously
wounded
on
the
pavement
of
the
cathedral
great
effusion
of
blood
a
crowd
of
priests
immediately
gathered
round
him
and
began
to
lament
loudly
not
because
a
man
had
been
stabbed
but
because
blood
had
defiled
the
temple
after
was
bell
rung
or
divine
service
performed
in
that
church
or
even
in
the
other
churches
because
the
was
closed
until
it
was
purified
by
my
lord
the
suffragan
says
sister
jeanne
goulaz
it
is
reported
seeing
his
friend
on
the
ground
ran
off
to
the
evangelicals
and
told
them
all
some
of
them
notwithstanding
the
danger
which
they
incurred
proceeded
to
the
cathedral
and
obtained
the
syndics
permission
to
carry
vandel
away

upon

march
this
effusion
of
blood
far
from
calming
men
minds
served
but
to
inflame
them
good
christians
were
more
excited
than
before
says
sister
jeanne
the
skirmish
in
which
being
seven
hundred
against
two
they
had
gained
the
advantage
was
an
omen
of
victory
they
looked
at
each
other
and
counted
their
numbers
are
the
majority
and
well
armed
they
said
must
sally
out
boldly
and
fight
these
rascals
the
principal
leaders
lay
and
ecclesiastic
withdrawing
into
a
private
part
of
the
cathedral
held
a
final
council
the
most
influential
represented
that
the
huguenots
had
celebrated
the
sacrament
that
they
persevered
in
holding
their
meetings
and
there
that
the
sacerdotal
authority
was
decreasing
and
the
number
of
heretics
increasing
and
that
there
was
only
one
means
left
of
saving
the
romish
every
heretic
to
death
the
syndics
stretched
out
their
wands
in
vain
and
ordered
them
to
keep
the
peace
all
was
useless
is
the
time
cried
the
priests
us
run
to
the
great
bell
and
give
the
signal
at
the
word
many
hastened
to
the
tower
of
the
church
and
began
to
ring
the
tocsin
at
the
same
time
those
who
were
in
the
church
prepared
to
march
sidenote
catholics
prepare
to
fight
three
of
the
syndics
were
devoted
to
the
catholic
party

pierre
de

and
claude
baud
finding
that
they
could
not
stop
the
riot
they
determined
if
possible
to
direct
it
claude
baud
lord
of
troches
in
whose
castle
many
a
plot
had
been
concocted
against
the
independence
of
geneva
would
have
desired
to
make
an
end
of
the
reform
but
not
by
violent
means
seeing
however
that
it
was
impossible
to
check
the
torrent
he
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
but
with
the
hope
of
restraining
it
and
afterwards
of
repressing
the
reform
by
legal
means
the
doors
of
the
church
said
baud
this
had
a
surprising
effect
the
catholics
on
a
sudden
grew
calmer
the
syndic
feared
that
if
they
came
to
blows
the
two
parties
might
become
confused
in
the
battle
and
that
friends
would
strike
friends
without
recognising
each
other
he
ordered
a
great
bundle
of
laurel
boughs
to
be
brought
in
and
addressing
the
crowd
around
him
said
citizens
they
used
to
give
garlands
to
the
conquerors
i
give
you
these
laurels
before
the
victory
they
will
distinguish
you
from
the
wicked
the
combatants
each
took
a
sprig
and
fastened
it
to
their
caps
and
then
the
pious
catholics
who
were
in
the
crowd
wishing
to
give
a
religious
character
to
the
proposed
that
they
should
implore
the
blessing
of
heaven
before
they
started
the
ecclesiastics
were
silent
immediately
and
turning
to
the
choir
prostrated
themselves
in
fervent
devotion
before
the
high
altar
all
present
knelt
down
great
abundance
of
tears
and
sang
the
famous
hymn
of
the
roman
breviary
vexilla
regis
prodeunt
as
soon
as
the
strain
was
ended
one
of
the
priests
said
us
commend
ourselves
to
the
blessed
virgin
that
she
may
intercede
for
us
and
for
the
holy
faith
and
all
as
with
one
voice
joined
in
the
prayer
which
the
people
were
accustomed
to
sing
at
the
execution
of
a
criminal
the
echoes
of
this
ominous
chant
having
died
away
in
the
aisles
of
the
vast
cathedral
the
priests
rose
from
their
knees
one
of
them
took
the
cross
while
some
laid
hold
of
other
banners
they
said
the
standards
of
the
king
advancing
the
excitement
grew
greater
every
minute
it
was
friday
the
one
before
passion
week
us
this
day
call
to
mind
the
day
on
which
our
lord
was
willing
to
shed
his
blood
for
us
and
therefore
let
us
not
spare
ours
let
us
take
vengeance
on
his
enemies
who
crucify
him
anew
more
cruelly
than
the
jews
did
they
uttered
such
cries
that
was
quite
pitiful
to
hear
them
and
was
no
heart
so
hard
as
not
to
melt
into
tears
sidenote
the
corps
are
formed
all
this
emotion
was
not
without
a
cause
the
religion
of
the
middle
ages
was
disappearing
we
believe
that
it
must
disappear
altogether
and
yet
we
are
touched
by
the
enthusiasm
displayed
by
its
adherents
which
was
worthy
of
a
better
cause
syndic
baud
who
wished
to
give
an
appearance
of
legality
to
the
clerical
movement
called
percival
de
pesmes
and
ordered
him
to
go
with
a
body
of
men
and
fetch
the
banner
of
the
city
at
length
the
great
bell
which
had
kept
on
ringing
was
silent
the
ringers
came
down
from
the
tower
and
joined
the
rest
of
their
party
the
churchmen
then
formed
into
companies
and
elected
their
captains
all
were
full
of
courage
and
ardour
and
resembled
a
rather
than
a
church
the
companies
defiled
in
front
of
the
high
altar
and
the
syndic
ordering
the
doors
to
be
thrown
open
all
the
clerical
army
quitted
the
temple
descended
with
a
firm
step
the
steep
street
of
the
perron
and
proceeded
towards
the
molard
which
was
the
general
rendezvous
for
those
who
desired
on
that
day
to
destroy
both
the
reformed
and
the
reformation
in
geneva
as
soon
as
the
tocsin
was
heard
the
city
was
agitated
to
its
most
retired
quarters
and
even
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
districts
had
listened
with
alarm
to
its
sound
the
startled
and
uneasy
citizens
caught
up
their
arms
rushed
hastily
from
their
houses
and
ran
poor
wandering
sheep
without
a
shepherd
some
one
way
some
another
not
knowing
where
to
go
what
was
the
matter
and
whether
the
enemy
was
within
the
walls
or
without
the
peasants
of
the
vicinity
forewarned
by
the
agents
of
the
canons
entered
the
city
in
arms
the
confusion
continued
to
increase
some
cried
others
on
all
shouted
alarm
some
ran
to
the
gates
others
to
the
and
others
to
the
ramparts
but
the
priests
who
had
contrived
the
affair
and
who
were
marching
large
bands
from
different
quarters
towards
the
molard
excited
the
ignorant
people
to
follow
them
and
shouting
so
as
to
drown
all
other
cries
with
the
lutherans
thus
made
it
known
who
were
the
enemies
to
be
attacked
the
molard
they
added
with
the
dogs
that
want
to
destroy
our
holy
mother
church
no
fervent
catholic
hesitated
all
ran
along
the
streets
isolated
or
in
bands
they
drew
their
swords
then
arquebusses
rattled
it
was
like
a
flock
of
birds
in
search
of
their
prey
opening
their
talons
and
plunging
swiftly
upon
the
molard
sidenote
the
mustering
of
the
hosts
meanwhile
the
main
clerical
body
that
which
started
from
pierre
arrived
it
numbered
from
six
to
seven
hundred
priests
monks
sacristans
and
devout
laymen
all
well
armed
syndic
baud
marching
at
their
head
and
his
great
hat
and
feathers
when
this
body
debouched
on
the
square
by
the
arcade
of
the
fort
de
the
molard
and
adjacent
streets
were
filled
with
an
agitated
and
confused
crowd
but
immediately
by
the
syndic
order
companies
were
formed
in
imitation
of
that
of
pierre
and
all
the
people
put
themselves
order
for
fighting
baud
having
thus
drawn
out
his
corps
proceeded
to
count
them
there
were
about
men
not
reckoning
the
old
men
women
and
children
who
shouted
and
wept
and
although
unarmed
added
to
the
tumult
the
catholics
were
full
of
hope
to
the
majority
of
them
the
struggle
was
a
mere
party
matter
but
others
better
instructed
and
better
theologians
than
the
rest
felt
that
it
was
an
effort
to
expel
for
ever
from
geneva
the
doctrines
of
protestantism
touching
the
of
holy
scripture
justification
works
the
mass
the
church
and
especially
grace
to
which
alone
the
reformation
attributed
salvation
while
the
romish
church
claimed
a
part
in
conversion
for
the
natural
powers
of
man
and
looked
upon
this
difference
between
the
two
churches
as
the
essential
point
at
the
same
time
however
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
just
then
they
troubled
themselves
very
little
about
theology
being
ready
to
contend
with
the
arms
of
men
of
war
the
two
bodies
were
especially
animated
by
political
passions
the
catholics
feared
lest
their
enemies
should
succeed
in
escaping
the
gates
of
the
city
said
the
syndic
that
no
one
can
take
flight
again
cries
were
heard
lead
us
to
baudichon
answered
baud
us
wait
for
the
other
corps
before
we
attack
there
were
still
three
bands
to
come
the
first
commanded
by
the
bishop
equerry
percival
de
pesmes
was
to
come
straight
from
the
bringing
the
banner
as
we
have
said
the
second
commanded
by
canon
de
veigy
descending
from
the
west
was
to
make
for
the
molard
by
the
rue
de
la
cité
the
third
coming
from
the
suburb
of
gervais
was
to
cross
the
rhone
bridge
and
was
commanded
by
captain
bellessert
was
a
stout
fellow
and
like
a
madman
says
froment
the
band
that
he
conducted
was
the
most
violent
in
the
republic
these
three
corps
united
with
the
men
already
at
the
molard
could
not
fail
to
give
the
to
the
reformed
and
the
reformation
but
as
they
did
not
appear
the
catholics
and
mamelukes
who
were
ready
for
fighting
zealous
in
the
cause
of
the
pope
and
overflowing
with
hatred
for
the
reform
became
impatient
and
striking
the
ground
with
the
of
their
guns
desired
to
march
forthwith
they
cried
us
wait
said
the
syndic
whether
because
he
feared
that
business
would
not
take
well
as
the
chronicle
says
or
because
he
wished
by
an
imposing
force
to
constrain
the
reformed
to
surrender
without
fighting
or
lastly
because
he
hoped
that
if
he
procrastinated
some
unforeseen
circumstance
might
happen
to
disarm
the
combatants
want
artillery
he
said
besiege
house
this
quieted
the
most
ardent
by
giving
them
something
to
do
they
hurried
off
to
the
arsenal
but
it
was
doubtful
whether
it
would
be
opened
to
them
as
the
was
opposed
to
them
the
named
bossu
hunchback
in
consequence
of
his
infirmity
a
man
of
vulgar
character
and
suspected
morals
and
a
strong
partisan
of
the
priests
did
not
hesitate
he
delivered
up
the
artillery
to
the
catholics
who
dragged
away
the
cannon
with
much
uproar
planted
them
in
the
square
and
loaded
them
at
this
moment
arrived
the
band
led
by
the
descendant
of
the
crusaders
the
young
and
dashing
percival
de
pesmes
eager
to
fight
like
his
fathers
for
the
pope
and
his
church
against
these
new
saracens
he
bore
the
great
banner
with
pride
and
defiling
with
his
corps
drew
them
up
in
line
of
battle
syndic
baud
took
the
banner
from
his
hands
and
planted
it
in
the
middle
of
the
square
the
people
electrified
at
the
sight
a
loud
shout
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
the
republic
is
arming
the
city
banner
floats
above
the
catholic
ranks
and
the
huguenots
are
only
rebels
sidenote
the
nuns
of
saint
claire
the
monks
took
the
most
active
part
in
this
business
the
convents
were
therefore
empty
all
but
that
of
saint
claire
which
alone
was
not
deserted
the
nuns
however
wished
to
take
part
in
the
struggle
they
said
worthy
fathers
have
gone
to
share
in
the
fight
with
a
number
of
monks
because
it
is
in
behalf
of
the
faith
let
us
kneel
before
god
that
he
may
show
mercy
to
the
poor
city
the
mother
abbess
drew
a
cross
of
ashes
on
the
foreheads
of
the
sisters
after
which
they
marched
in
procession
round
the
cloister
invoking
in
devout
litanies
the
protection
of
the
whole
celestial
choir
then
forming
a
cross
they
took
their
places
in
the
middle
of
the
choir
and
there
distracted
and
weeping
they
fell
on
their
knees
and
cried
aloud
o
god
through
the
intercession
of
the
glorious
virgin
mary
and
all
the
saints
give
victory
to
the
christians
and
bring
the
poor
wanderers
back
to
the
way
of
salvation
at
this
moment
the
sisters
heard
a
noise
at
the
gate
of
the
convent
it
was
a
few
good
catholic
women
who
very
much
afraid
themselves
came
to
bring
the
sisters
tidings
calculated
to
add
to
their
distress
the
heretics
win
the
day
they
said
will
certainly
make
you
all
marry
young
and
to
your
perdition
this
was
the
customary
bugbear
of
the
poor
nuns
they
were
superstitious
and
even
fanatical
but
nothing
indicates
that
they
were
not
pure
a
tradition
to
the
effect
that
there
was
an
underground
communication
between
their
convent
and
that
of
the
gray
friars
is
a
fiction
as
void
of
foundation
as
the
frightful
news
of
a
brought
by
their
indiscreet
friends
the
terrified
nuns
crossed
themselves
sang
their
litanies
once
more
and
cried
louder
than
ever
holy
virgin
give
victory
to
the
christians
sidenote
a
cruel
husband
the
agitation
in
the
city
was
then
at
its
height
the
shouts
of
the
priests
were
frightful
they
bawled
lustily
to
those
who
lagged
behind
exhorted
those
who
appeared
indifferent
and
animated
the
whole
body
with
voice
and
gesture
as
hunters
urge
their
hounds
after
the
stag
the
catholics
responded
to
the
tumultuous
clamours
of
these
ministers
of
disorder
and
strife
but
the
tempest
was
not
confined
to
the
streets
scenes
still
more
harrowing
were
taking
place
in
the
houses
said
the
wisest
men
is
no
humanity
left
and
they
take
no
account
of
the
ties
of
nature
one
of
the
most
fiery
catholics
hearing
the
tocsin
was
hurriedly
fitting
on
his
armour
when
his
wife
a
fervent
romanist
like
himself
and
whose
father
was
at
the
head
of
the
lutherans
was
filled
with
terror
at
seeing
her
animation
and
looked
at
him
with
a
dejected
countenance
she
was
micah
daughter
of
baudichon
de
la
maisonneuve
her
catholic
faith
did
not
make
the
young
wife
forget
the
sweet
and
holy
ties
that
bind
a
child
to
her
father
she
shuddered
at
each
malediction
uttered
by
her
husband
against
the
author
of
her
days
at
length
her
grief
broke
out
in
a
flood
of
tears
her
fanatical
husband
exasperated
to
the
highest
degree
against
maisonneuve
who
was
regarded
as
the
main
support
of
the
heresy
turned
back
and
without
showing
the
least
pity
said
cry
as
much
as
you
please
if
we
come
to
blows
and
i
meet
your
father
he
shall
be
the
first
on
whom
i
shall
try
my
strength
i
will
kill
him
or
he
shall
kill
me
and
then
callous
at
the
sight
of
micah
whose
tears
flowed
faster
at
these
words
which
pierced
her
heart
the
barbarous
husband
said
as
he
left
her
is
a
bad
christian
a
renegade
the
worst
of
the
wretched
baudichon
micah
was
twice
married
first
to
bernard
combet
and
secondly
to
guyot
taillon
we
have
not
been
able
to
discover
which
of
her
two
husbands
was
so
cruel
probably
it
was
the
first
these
distressing
scenes
became
more
every
moment
in
the
houses
nothing
was
heard
but
the
cries
and
groans
of
mothers
and
wives
of
daughters
and
young
children
the
streets
echoed
with
the
oaths
of
the
men
who
cursed
the
reformation
and
the
first
man
who
had
brought
it
there
truth
it
is
not
possible
says
the
chronicler
describe
the
cries
and
tears
which
then
filled
the
whole
city
but
the
mournful
sounds
of
grief
and
sorrow
which
rose
in
the
air
could
not
drown
the
fanatical
and
sonorous
voices
of
the
priests
during
this
time
a
deep
and
solemn
awe
prevailed
in
baudichon
house
the
evangelicals
were
not
insensible
to
the
hatred
which
was
arrayed
against
them
but
the
greatness
of
the
danger
gave
them
that
calmness
which
the
christian
experiences
in
the
presence
of
death
the
strong
encouraged
the
weak
addressing
them
in
words
of
piety
and
feeling
they
said
all
the
world
would
agree
in
the
truth
we
should
be
at
peace
but
as
the
majority
fight
against
it
we
can
not
confess
christ
without
encountering
resistance
and
hatred
it
is
the
malice
of
the
wicked
one
that
divides
us
into
contrary
bands
and
everywhere
kindles
strife
and
debate
sidenote
novel
reinforcement
an
unexpected
reinforcement
added
to
the
numbers
of
the
catholic
troop
the
women
of
that
party
had
not
all
a
tender
soul
and
bruised
heart
like
baudichon
daughter
the
virtues
of
the
evangelical
women
the
eagerness
with
which
they
had
renounced
their
jewels
and
dress
in
favour
of
the
poor
had
excited
the
displeasure
of
many
of
them
and
the
thought
that
they
no
longer
came
to
kneel
with
them
at
the
altar
of
mary
had
filled
them
with
anger
and
hatred
the
tempest
then
sweeping
through
the
city
fanned
the
evil
passions
of
the
weaker
sex
in
every
house
the
wives
and
sisters
and
even
the
mothers
of
the
catholics
got
ready
they
assembled
the
children
from
twelve
to
fifteen
years
old
and
proceeded
with
them
to
the
place
where
they
had
agreed
to
meet
this
assemblage
of
women
says
sister
jeanne
who
was
very
intimate
with
them
were
full
seven
hundred
children
from
twelve
to
fifteen
years
old
firmly
resolved
to
do
good
service
along
with
their
mothers
when
these
ladies
met
they
held
a
parliament
of
a
new
sort
and
their
speeches
were
far
more
impassioned
than
those
of
the
men
they
had
no
doubt
that
their
husbands
would
put
all
their
adversaries
to
death
but
were
vexed
to
think
that
their
wives
would
be
left
alive
it
should
happen
said
one
of
them
our
husbands
fight
against
the
unbelievers
let
us
also
make
war
and
their
heretic
wives
in
order
that
the
breed
may
be
this
was
the
only
way
these
pious
ladies
thought
of
preserving
geneva
catholic
if
the
wives
and
children
were
spared
the
heresy
would
shoot
forth
again
in
a
few
years
a
unanimous
cry
of
approval
was
raised
by
the
women
and
even
by
the
accompanying
children
and
the
amazons
immediately
prepared
for
the
combat
they
armed
their
children
distributing
little
hatchets
and
swords
among
them
when
there
were
no
more
weapons
to
give
out
their
mothers
told
them
to
fill
their
hats
and
caps
with
stones
they
too
fiercely
gathered
up
their
aprons
which
they
filled
with
missiles
sister
jeanne
does
not
omit
a
single
detail
in
her
narrative
for
it
is
of
this
that
she
is
most
proud
some
of
these
women
had
stationed
themselves
at
the
windows
to
crush
the
evangelicals
at
the
moment
of
battle
by
pouring
their
missiles
down
upon
them
but
the
more
determined
marched
with
the
children
to
the
molard
where
they
arrived
with
loud
shouts
strange
madness
as
if
god
who
requires
in
the
christian
woman
meek
and
quiet
and
forbids
her
to
be
adorned
braided
hair
and
costly
array
did
not
all
the
more
forbid
her
to
arm
herself
with
stones
and
march
to
battle
frenzied
and
guilty
women
some
huguenots
observing
them
from
afar
asked
with
astonishment
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
such
a
singular
assemblage
they
seemed
to
resemble
those
druidesses
who
as
it
is
related
when
their
sanctuary
was
threatened
ran
to
and
fro
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
in
black
robes
with
hair
dishevelled
and
waving
torches
in
their
hands
delighted
at
the
sight

unwilling
to
be
behindhand
exclaimed

there
were
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
armed

in
the

the

and

set
the
example
shall
the
citizens
remain
behind
the
whole

assembled
at
the
molard
shouted
again
and
again
forward
the
syndics
did
not
incline
to
attack
but
the
excited
crowd
carried
them
away
the
plan
was
to
march
to
baudichon
house
where
the
huguenots
had
assembled
to
set
fire
to
it
and
thus
having
forced
them
to
come
out
to
murder
them
as
they
were
escaping
from
the
flames
by
the
doors
and

of

us
wait
for

at

observing
the
danger
that
threatened

the

portion
were
not

to
the
gravity
of
the
situation
but
they
remained
firm

full
of
confidence
in

geneva

in

with

they
said
how
the

his

treat

noticing
the
paleness
of
his

they
despaired
of
his

this
was
not
the
only
presage
of
the
danger
that
threatened
them
the

increasing
in
violence

even
there
they
looked
at
each

with
astonishment
and
even
with
alarm
fury
they
said

was
at
this
solemn
hour
calm

and
christianlike
no

was
more
exposed
than
he
his
house
was
to
be
as
it
were

forgetful
of

he
went
up
to
such
as
were
dejected
and
said
must
show
our
magnanimity
even
should
they
drive
us
to
despair
the
wicked
are
already

arches
in

god
does
not
look

great
or
small
but
to
the

for
which
they
fight
if
we
are
under
the
banner
of
jesus
god
will
be
a
wall
of

these
words
encouraged
such
as
were
shaken
and
gave
joy
to
their
afflicted
hearts
and
scarcely
had
baudichon
uttered
them
than
those
who
stood
round
him
fell
on
their
knees
and
bowed
before
the
lord
one
of
them
prayed
god
thou
givest
the
rein
to
the
wicked
only
so
far
as
is
necessary
to
try
us
stop
them
therefore
and
restrain
them
lest
they
hurt
us
change
the
hearts
of
our
enemies
and
look
only
to
the
cause
for
which
we
are
going
to
fight
this
simple
prayer
availed
more
than
a
rising
from
their
knees
the
friends
of
the
reform
stretched
out
their
hands
and
said
swear
to
die
in
cause
and
to
keep
faith
and
loyalty
with
one
another
and
like
the
martyrs
of
the
early
ages
they
waited
for
the
blow
with
which
they
were
threatened
because
they
refused
to
abandon
the
gospel
which
god
was
then
restoring
to
christendom
while
the
evangelicals
were
praying
the
band
so
impatiently
expected
from
gervais
began
to
cross
the
bridge
at
last
the
now
who
inclined
to
the
reform
from
political
motives
being
called
by
his
office
to
repress
all
disorder
had
taken
his
post
between
the
bridge
and
the
city
near
house
and
those
who
belonged
to
neither
party
had
rallied
round
him
just
as
the
corps
from
the
suburb
was
debouching
from
the
bridge
and
entering
the
city
philippe
ordered
them
to
return
at
these
words
their
leader
bellessert
the
butcher
furious
at
the
attempt
to
stop
him
flew
into
a
passion
and
with
horrible
oaths
struck
the
so
violently
with
his
halberd
that
he
fell
to
the
ground
at
the
instant
claude
de
genève
and
other
citizens
who
followed
philippe
dashed
forward
to
meet
the
assailants

sprang
to
his
feet
and
turning
sword
in
hand
upon
the
man
who
had
struck
him
wounded
bellessert
at
the
same
time
his
followers
hitting
right
and
left
drove
the
gervaisians
back
upon
the
bridge
the
latter
attempted
in
vain
to
resume
the
offensive
philippe
troop
did
not
give
them
time
to
breathe
many
had
been
wounded
and
disorder
was
in
their
ranks
they
were
too
proud
and
violent
to
give
way
if
they
had
not
suffered
much
loss
at
last
they
fled
and
returned
dejected
to
their
houses
the
captain
followers
immediately
closed
the
bridge
gate
to
prevent
the
people
of
the
suburb
from
returning
into
the
city
this
measure
exposed
the
reformed
in
gervais
to
some
danger
aimé
levet
lived
as
we
have
said
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
his
wife
distressed
at
the
struggle
and
the
wounds
her
brethren
were
about
to
give
and
to
receive
had
gone
out
imprudently
perhaps
and
standing
in
the
street
tried
to
discover
what
was
going
on
at
this
moment
the
catholic
women
of
the
quarter
inflamed
by
the
sight
of
their
idol
bellessert
wounds
and
determined
not
to
be
behind
the
women
of
the
city
in
warlike
zeal
caught
sight
of
claudine
levet
to
whom
they
attributed
all
the
mischief
with
a
loud
cry
they
rushed
upon
her
exclaiming
us
begin
the
war
by
throwing
this
dog
into
the
rhone
claudine
seeing
the
furies
coming
uttered
a
shriek
and
tricky
according
to
sister
jeanne
returned
hastily
into
the
house
and
shut
the
door
it
was
certainly
a
very
lawful
the
catholic
women
instantly
moved
to
attack
it
but
much
as
they
tried
to
break
the
door
down
they
could
not
succeed
they
then
vented
their
fury
on
the
apothecary
drugs
at
first
they
took
what
served
for
show
and
then
entering
the
shop
them
all
contemptuously
into
the
street
this
expedition
against
the
drugs
did
not
calm
them
leaving
the
shop
and
standing
in
front
of
the
house
they
turned
their
angry
eyes
to
claudine
windows
and
used
insulting
language
madame
levet
remained
calm
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
and
her
thoughts
to
heaven
where
she
found
great
matter
of
joy
to
blot
out
all
her
sorrows
at
last
the
catholics
retired
wroth
because
they
could
not
get
at
this
woman
or
any
other
claudine
was
saved
sidenote
plan
to
burn
out
the
huguenots
while
this
was
going
on
the
third
band
expected
at
the
molard
that
headed
by
canon
veigy
had
assembled
in
the
upper
part
of
the
city
the
immobility
of
the
reformers
who
did
not
leave
baudichon
house
fretted
the
canon
and
those
whom
he
commanded
keep
themselves
still
as
hares
he
said
must
compel
them
to
leave
their
form
this
they
prepared
to
do
it
had
been
decided
as
we
have
said
by
moine
and
his
friends
the
chiefs
of
the
movement
that
they
should
surround
and
set
fire
to
baudichon
house
so
that
the
heretics
should
be
stifled
burnt
driven
out
and
dispersed
in
the
opinion
of
some
it
was
a
capital
idea
of
the
huguenots
to
shut
themselves
up
in
one
house
for
by
this
means
a
single
match
would
suffice
to
get
rid
of
them
but
the
plan
of
was
not
to
everybody
taste
can
not
be
done
without
great
mischief
said
the
wiser
heads
whole
street
might
be
burnt
the
barbarous
plan
had
however
been
resolved
on
and
its
execution
entrusted
to
canon
veigy
corps
it
was
a
churchman
who
had
been
charged
with
the
cruel
duty
de
veigy
was
to
pass
through
the
narrow
street
of
the
trois
rois
behind
the
rhone
set
fire
to
baudichon
house
and
drive
into
the
street
so
that
they
could
escape
nowhere
the
canon
band
was
preparing
to
descend
into
the
city
to
perform
its
task
when
some
catholics
running
to
the
announced
the
defeat
of
the
troops
from
gervais
may
expect
a
similar
encounter
said
the
canon
and
his
subordinates
and
being
not
at
all
eager
to
measure
weapons
with
the
they
resolved
to
join
the
crowd
on
the
molard
by
passing
to
the
east
in
order
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
philippe
attack
and
to
have
a
reinforcement
to
burn
the
huguenots
changing
their
direction
they
descended
by
the
rue
verdaine
when
they
arrived
at
the
molard
they
were
very
ill
received
everybody
reproached
them
calling
them
cowards
and
traitors
the
were
astonished
and
vexed
because
they
had
not
set
fire
to
the
house
as
had
been
agreed
upon
sidenote
huguenots
on
the
defensive
the
news
of
this
scheme
for
burning
them
out
had
reached
the
citadel
of
the
reformed
maisonneuve
and
his
friends
hesitated
no
longer
thus
far
they
had
responded
to
the
fury
of
their
adversaries
by
remaining
quiet
they
desired
as
much
as
possible
to
spare
the
effusion
of
blood
but
now
their
moderation
became
useless
at
first
they
had
been
only
sixty
their
numbers
had
increased
but
they
were
still
inferior
to
their
adversaries
they
determined
however
to
repel
force
by
force
they
sallied
forth
therefore
calm
and
silent
for
they
felt
the
gravity
of
the
moment
on
arriving
in
the
rue
des
allemands
they
drew
up
in
line
of
battle
five
deep
according
to
the
swiss
practice
the
front
rank
was
about
paces
from
the
enemy
they
were
determined
not
to
take
the
offensive
will
wait
for
our
adversaries
they
said
if
they
attack
us
we
will
sooner
die
than
retreat
a
single
step
although
they
were
as
we
have
said
by
no
means
numerous
in
comparison
with
the
several
catholic
bands
they
were
firm
and
full
of
hope
there
were
neither
priests
women
nor
children
with
them
to
embarrass
them
all
were
stout
resolute
disciplined
men
who
feared
not
to
fight
one
against
ten
they
did
not
however
place
their
confidence
in
their
strength
they
did
turn
from
one
side
to
the
other
to
set
their
hopes
in
vain
things
the
most
pious
among
them
that
there
was
not
one
spark
of
certain
help
for
them
except
in
god
alone
the
fight
was
about
to
begin
the
reformed
knowing
that
the
city
artillery
had
been
surrendered
by
the
bossu
to
their
adversaries
and
pointed
at
the
molard
had
procured
some
cannon
probably
by
the
intervention
of
the
the
huguenots
marching
boldly
on
two
sides
of
the
great
square
had
planted
their
in
the
rue
du
rhone
others
in
the
rue
du
marché
only
ninety
paces
from
the
catholics
on
each
side
the
artillery
was
ready
to
be
discharged
the
arquebuses
were
loaded
the
spears
and
halberds
were
in
the
hands
of
the
combatants
the
women
and
children
of
the
romish
party
were
bringing
stones
there
were
transports
of
anger
cries
and
terrible
threats
all
were
prepared
for
the
onset
and
a
massacre
seemed
inevitable
at
this
moment
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
was
heard
it
was
not
the
signal
of
battle
but
the
prelude
the
city
crier
stopping
at
the
corner
of
some
neighbouring
street
proclaimed
every
foreigner
should
retire
to
his
lodging
under
pain
of
three
lashes
with
a
rope
in
this
way
they
cleared
the
place
where
the
battle
was
to
be
fought
the
trumpet
and
the
crier
shrill
voice
soon
died
away
and
there
was
a
deathlike
silence
on
each
side
there
were
noble
souls
lovers
of
peace
who
were
a
prey
to
the
deepest
emotions
at
the
thought
that
brothers
were
about
to
attack
brothers
and
many
turned
a
sorrowful
look
on
the
streets
that
were
soon
to
be
stained
with
the
blood
of
their
these
compassionate
men
would
have
liked
to
restrain
the
fratricidal
arms
but
they
trembled
before
the
priests
one
says
a
contemporary
venture
to
speak
to
the
ecclesiastics
to
propose
peace
the
great
pride
of
the
priests
intimidated
them
and
they
feared
to
be
called
lutherans
to
desire
to
prevent
the
shedding
of
blood
was
to
be
a
partisan
of
the
reformation
the
parties
cast
threatening
glances
at
each
other
and
the
two
armies
were
about
to
come
into
violent
collision
sidenote
prayers
and
tears
then
the
agony
burst
forth
some
of
the
wives
mothers
and
daughters
who
were
in
the
place
du
molard
and
who
up
to
this
moment
had
been
full
of
ardour
for
the
combat
were
moved
and
could
not
restrain
their
anguish
the
tenderness
of
their
sex
resumed
its
sway
they
let
go
their
aprons
and
the
stones
contained
in
them
fell
to
the
ground
they
burst
into
tears
and
gave
utterance
to
long
and
sorrowful
moaning
they
said
father
is
armed
against
the
son
brother
against
brother
neighbour
against
neighbour
they
are
all
ready
to
kill
one
another
the
emotion
became
almost
universal
whilst
many
of
the
catholic
women
were
thus
transformed
the
evangelical
women
who
remained
at
home
were
praying
they
reflected
that
however
the
world
may
torment
and
vex
nothing
can
happen
but
what
god
himself
has
ordained
they
put
the
immutable
decree
of
the
lord
who
wills
to
maintain
the
kingdom
of
his
son
for
ever
in
opposition
to
the
wicked
conspiracies
by
which
the
men
of
the
world
assail
it
and
doubted
not
that
god
would
look
upon
and
help
them
in
their

truce
between
the
two
parties
from
march
to
may
just
at
that
time
some
foreigners
were
staying
in
geneva
and
particularly
seven
merchants
of
friburg
who
had
come
for
the
fair
they
looked
with
sorrow
on
the
spectacle
around
them
and
could
not
understand
how
citizens
could
go
so
far
as
to
kill
one
another
satisfy
the
appetite
of
their
priests
says
a
manuscript
these
worthy
switzers
came
forward
to
mediate
the
chiefs
of
the
catholic
party
not
doubting
that
they
were
on
their
side
asked
for
their
support
do
not
meddle
in
business
of
this
kind
wisely
answered
the
friburgers
it
be
to
restore
peace
since
we
are
and
good
friends
with
you
as
well
as
with
the
others
they
proceeded
to
the
rue
des
allemands
and
said
to
the
reformed
at
the
great
multitude
of
people
that
is
against
you
this
matter
must
be
settled
before
worse
befals
you
the
reformed
who
were
ready
for
the
battle
made
answer
disturbance
did
not
begin
with
us
and
we
should
be
distressed
to
do
anything
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
council
or
of
the
people
we
only
ask
to
be
left
at
peace
and
to
live
according
to
god
obeying
the
magistrates
as
the
gospel
commands
we
are
acting
in
for
they
have
conspired
to
kill
us
if
so
many
priests
and
monks
remain
assembled
in
the
square
rest
assured
that
we
shall
defend
ourselves
to
the
last
if
it
please
god
to
assist
us
but
we
are
not
pleased
at
having
to
fight
against
fathers
brothers
relations
friends
and
neighbours
to
gratify
the
appetites
of
the
priests
and
monks
sidenote
moderation
of
the
friburgers
the
friburgers
encouraged
by
these
words
returned
to
the
molard
and
addressing
the
priests
said
is
neither
good
nor
honourable
and
above
all
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
your
office
thus
to
excite
the
people
to
kill
one
another
it
is
your
duty
to
be
in
your
houses
or
at
church
praying
to
god
rather
than
be
thus
in
arms
when
the
people
are
at
variance
you
should
reconcile
them
instead
of
exciting
them
to
shed
blood
these
were
christian
words
and
the
laymen
delivered
an
excellent
exhortation
to
the
clergy
but
the
latter
were
so
enraged
that
they
would
listen
to
nothing
after
the
pacific
address
of
the
friburgers
showed
themselves
more
heated
than
ever
in
their
desire
that
all
should
be
killed
these
worthy
merchants
astounded
at
finding
ecclesiastics
so
eager
for
battle
thought
that
the
laymen
would
be
more
moderate
and
went
off
to
parley
with
the
magistrates
there
is
any
bloodshed
they
said
the
blame
will
be
laid
on
you
do
your
duty
it
is
yours
to
command
order
the
two
parties
to
withdraw
to
their
homes
the
honour
of
the
magistrates
who
at
heart
desired
peace
was
touched
and
they
resolved
to
put
down
the
tumult
turning
to
the
priests
upon
whom
the
whole
affair
depended
they
said
to
them
before
the
people
must
restore
peace
but
the
clergy
would
do
nothing
and
indeed
excited
the
people
all
the
more
to
attack
the
lutherans
the
indignant
friburgers
determined
to
frighten
them
pray
you
sirs
not
to
be
so
high
they
said
if
it
should
come
to
fighting
we
would
rather
be
on
their
side
than
on
yours
they
are
very
different
soldiers
from
you
in
better
order
and
we
have
seen
them
then
pointing
to
the
listening
people
they
continued
you
think
sir
priests
that
the
men
here
who
have
their
children
parents
and
friends
on
the
other
side
wish
to
kill
them
or
to
be
killed
by
them
for
love
of
you
indeed
we
pray
them
to
withdraw
and
if
after
that
you
desire
to
attack
your
enemies
think
what
you
are
about
perchance
you
may
not
have
the
opportunity
of
returning
the
worthy
friburgers
did
not
stop
here
after
speaking
to
the
magistrates
and
priests
they
began
to
harangue
the
people
approaching
the
citizens
they
spoke
to
them
singly
have
sons
relations
and
friends
on
the
huguenot
side
do
you
want
to
kill
them
or
be
killed
by
them
we
advise
you
to
let
the
priests
fight
it
out
by
themselves
many
highly
approved
of
this
remonstrance
are
very
foolish
they
said
should
we
get
killed
for
the
priests
let
them
defend
themselves
if
they
like
let
them
contend
with
holy
scripture
and
not
with
the
sword
some
whom
reason
could
not
convince
were
seized
with
fear
the
good
sense
of
the
friburgers
dissipated
the
charm
of
sacerdotal
fanaticism
the
natural
affections
repressed
for
a
moment
resumed
their
power
the
affair
be
arranged
was
the
cry
from
all
quarters
arbitrate
sidenote
a
consultation
the
magistrates
seeing
the
priests
deserted
regained
their
courage
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
the
council
assembled
in
the
middle
of
the
molard
the
ushers
keeping
off
the
crowd
the
syndics
were
the
first
to
protest
against
the
spilling
of
blood
many
influential
councillors
supported
them
and
the
majority
of
the
people
seemed
to
declare
in
favour
of
peace
then
the
nicholas
du
crest
claude
baud
and
pierre
de
malbuisson
attended
by
several
captains
advanced
to
treat
with
de
la
maisonneuve
and
his
friends
the
foremost
of
the
huguenots
seeing
them
approach
thought
that
the
battle
was
beginning
and
one
of
them
a
prompt
and
energetic
man
arranging
a
piece
of
artillery
began
to
take
aim
at
the
centre
of
the
group
and
got
ready
to
apply
the
match
shot
would
have
made
a
terrible
breach
says
froment
this
rapid
movement
alarmed
those
who
were
approaching
on
all
sides
they
shouted
out
is
made
at
these
words
the
gunner
stopped
the
soldiers
drew
back
the
syndics
came
forward
on
one
side
baudichon
and
his
friends
on
the
other
and
the
two
parties
conferred
together
confidence
was
not
yet
restored
it
was
agreed
to
give
hostages
three
notable
men
were
given
up
on
each
side
and
among
the
six
was
a
canon
named
guet
immediately
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
was
heard
in
the
city
and
the
herald
proclaimed
man
shall
lay
down
his
arms
and
return
quietly
home
without
quarrel
or
dispute
under
pain
of
being
hanged
and
no
one
shall
sing
song
or
ballad
provoking
to
quarrel
under
pain
of
being
whipped
and
banished
the
most
diverse
opinions
prevailed
at
that
moment
in
the
city
the
priests
and
fervent
disciples
of
rome
could
find
no
comfort
wishing
to
destroy
the
reformation
at
any
cost
they
thought
it
very
to
put
the
reformed
to
death
they
were
particularly
envenomed
against
the
some
of
them
publicly
called
him
a
traitor
peace
vexes
the
christians
sorely
writes
sister
jeanne
and
accordingly
they
were
heard
exclaiming
ought
now
to
them
from
the
in
order
to
be
no
more
frightened
or
vexed
on
their
account
say
the
truth
adds
the
devout
nun
would
have
been
better
than
letting
them
live
but
while
some
of
the
catholic
leaders
as
wernli
and
moine
returned
home
gloomy
and
discontented
hoping
that
the
business
was
merely
adjourned
others
both
reformed
and
catholics
gladly
recrossed
the
thresholds
of
their
homes
and
were
welcomed
with
tears
of
joy
wives
embraced
their
husbands
the
little
children
clung
round
their
fathers
while
the
elder
ones
took
off
their
swords
the
politicians
smiled
as
they
witnessed
the
joy
of
some
and
the
chagrin
of
others
they
shook
their
heads
and
thought
that
one
party
or
the
other
would
break
the
truce
as
soon
as
they
fancied
it
would
be
to
their
interest
to
do
so
is
a
sham
peace
they
said
but
nothing
could
console
certain
of
the
monks
they
muttered
in
their
convents
christians
would
easily
have
discomfited
and
reduced
the
heretics
to
subjection
and
now
these
wicked
ones
will
gain
the
supremacy
in
the
city
sidenote
project
of
reconciliation
on
the
following
day
march
the
council
of
sixty
assembled
settle
the
strife
of
the
day
before
the
tempest
was
not
yet
entirely
appeased
the
catholic
members
of
the
council
looked
with
threatening
eyes
on
the
most
notable
of
their
colleagues
jean
philippe
françois
faure
claude
roset
and
others
these
were
the
men
to
be
attacked
they
thought
for
the
strength
of
the
anticlerical
movement
lay
with
them
but
for
a
time
reconciliation
was
all
the
fashion
they
resolved
to
frame
a
compromise
which
would
satisfy
both
parties
and
some
of
the
magistrates
and
principal
citizens
met
to
arrange
a
system
for
uniting
rome
and
the
gospel
the
two
hundred
who
were
joined
by
many
other
citizens
being
assembled
on
the
march
the
first
liberated
the
hostages
and
then
proposed
the
famous
project
of
reconciliation
the
council
having
accepted
it
he
forwarded
a
copy
to
the
captains
of
each
company
and
turning
to
the
abbot
of
bonmont
who
pretty
regularly
discharged
the
functions
of
bishop
considering
the
prelate
continual
absence
the
chief
magistrate
said
to
him
vicar
i
shall
give
you
also
a
copy
of
this
decree
in
order
that
you
may
take
care
to
make
your
priests
live
properly
all
the
laymen
agreed
that
there
lay
the
main
difficulty
the
sitting
broke
up
each
company
was
immediately
drawn
up
on
its
place
the
captain
stood
in
the
centre
huguenots
and
mamelukes
listened
to
this
strange
decree
which
regulating
a
religious
matter
was
ordered
by
the
civil
authority
and
proclaimed
by
the
soldiers
sidenote
articles
of
peace
the
name
of
god
the
creator
and
redeemer
father
son
and
holy
ghost
read
the
captain
and
all
bared
their
heads
the
interest
of
peace
it
is
resolved
continued
the
officer
with
sonorous
voice
all
anger
grudges
injuries
and
between
any
soever
of
our
citizens
and
inhabitants
as
well
ecclesiastic
as
secular
and
also
all
battery
insult
and
reproach
committed
by
one
side
or
the
other
be
wholly
pardoned
the
listeners
appeared
satisfied
that
every
citizen
of
what
state
or
condition
soever
he
may
be
live
henceforward
in
peace
without
attempting
any
novelty
until
it
be
generally
to
live
here
is
a
reform
said
the
huguenots
it
is
in
the
future
that
no
one
speak
against
the
holy
sacraments
and
that
in
this
respect
every
one
be
at
liberty
according
to
his
liberty
and
conscience
what
strange
words
if
the
people
of
geneva
gained
that
everything
was
gained
no
one
continued
the
captain
without
the
license
of
the
superior
the
syndics
and
the
council
and
that
preacher
say
nothing
that
is
not
proved
by
holy
no
article
caused
greater
satisfaction
said
some
of
the
reformed
doctrine
is
that
of
holy
scripture
said
some
of
the
catholics
superior
will
contrive
that
no
heretic
preaches
the
captain
added
the
prohibition
to
eat
meat
on
friday
to
sing
songs
against
one
another
or
to
say
are
a
lutheran
are
a
papist
moreover
he
ordered
the
heads
of
families
to
inform
their
wives
and
children
of
the
decree
the
catholic
ladies
and
their
boys
had
been
sufficiently
forward
at
the
time
of
the
battle
not
to
be
forgotten
the
captain
having
finished
said
to
his
company
those
who
desire
peace
and
love
hold
up
their
hands
and
make
oath
before
god
the
reformers
who
obtained
holy
scripture
and
liberty
of
conscience
held
up
their
hands
the
catholics
seeing
that
the
episcopal
authority
and
fast
days
were
left
them
did
the
same
but
in
one
of
the
companies
a
huguenot
who
did
not
care
for
this
mixture
said
refuse
the
rhone
with
him
exclaimed
the
catholics
immediately
the
rhone
throw
him
into
the
rhone
without
mercy
like
a
mad
dog
nobody
however
was
drowned
and
next
day
there
was
a
general
procession
through
the
city
to
return
thanks
to
god
for
the
peace
the
catholics
triumphed
religious
liberty
and
the
bible
seemed
such
strange
things
that
they
had
nothing
to
fear
from
them
they
learnt
the
contrary
afterwards
but
at
this
time
the
words
looked
like
a
decoy
that
had
no
reality
merely
intended
to
attract
and
catch
the
huguenots
on
palm
sunday
a
very
learned
dominican
as
it
was
said
come
from
auxerre
was
commissioned
to
preach
the
victory
of
rome
the
crowd
was
so
great
that
the
convent
church
could
not
contain
it
he
was
conducted
to
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
building
where
he
got
up
into
a
pulpit
that
had
been
brought
out
for
him
standing
proudly
before
his
congregation
the
disciple
of
dominic
said
i
am
ready
to
enter
into
the
lists
with
these
preachers
let
my
lords
of
berne
send
as
many
as
they
like
i
will
undertake
to
confound
them
all
he
had
a
copious
flow
of
words
to
the
great
contempt
of
the
word
of
god
the
huguenots
scarcely
able
to
contain
themselves
exclaimed
canting
knaves
desire
to
blindfold
the
eyes
of
the
simple
so
that
they
may
not
see
the
sun
which
has
risen
on
us
in
his
brightness
the
dominican
continued
hurling
his
thunderbolts
without
intermission
then
suddenly
the
assembly
became
disturbed
the
women
screamed
the
men
were
agitated
it
was
believed
that
the
huguenots
were
sallying
from
the
city
for
the
convent
was
in
a
suburb
and
about
to
fall
on
the
congregation
the
gates
of
the
city
cried
some
and
the
devout
were
still
more
frightened
at
this
exclamation
some
drew
their
swords
others
their
daggers
all
got
ready
to
defend
themselves
the
poor
monk
fancying
the
lutherans
were
there
already
and
about
to
put
him
to
death
grew
frightened
turned
pale
fell
out
of
the
pulpit
in
a
faint
but
no
huguenots
appeared
the
congregation
began
to
enquire
into
the
cause
of
the
alarm
and
discovered
a
young
hare
which
had
been
let
loose
among
the
people
and
was
running
here
and
there
between
the
women
dresses
it
was
a
trick
played
by
some
foolish
jester
there
was
a
good
deal
of
laughter
in
the
city
at
the
intrepid
champions
of
rome
who
had
so
heroically
drawn
their
daggers
against
a
leveret
sidenote
the
lord
supper
a
ceremony
of
another
kind
more
serious
and
absorbing
was
in
preparation
it
was
and
the
evangelicals
felt
the
necessity
of
meeting
in
a
spirit
of
christian
fraternity
around
the
lord
table
on
holy
thursday
april
fourscore
men
and
several
women
assembled
in
the
garden
at
the
pré
first
one
of
them
washed
the
feet
of
the
others
in
remembrance
of
the
like
act
done
by
our
lord
it
was
not
an
idle
imitation
with
them
they
understood
christ
meaning
them
that
no
one
should
refuse
to
descend
to
serve
his
brethren
and
equals
however
low
and
abject
the
service
might
be
and
they
felt
that
charity
is
abandoned
it
is
because
every
one
takes
more
than
he
wants
and
despises
almost
all
the
others
after
the
washing
of
the
feet
the
holy
sacrament
was
celebrated
these
energetic
men
humbled
themselves
like
little
children
before
god
and
approaching
the
table
in
sincere
faith
many
experienced
that
the
presence
of
the
redeemer
although
spiritual
is
real
and
strengthens
the
inner
man
as
soon
as
the
news
of
this
celebration
became
known
all
the
city
spoke
of
it
and
sarcasms
were
not
spared
they
said
bitten
one
after
another
into
a
slice
of
bread
and
cheese
in
token
of
peace
and
union
and
thereupon
the
catholics
laughed
sister
jeanne
informs
us
but
the
laughter
was
soon
changed
into
fear
as
they
returned
from
the
pré
several
huguenots
and
some
of
the
most
dreaded
were
among
them
walked
through
the
streets
together
a
few
silly
gossips
having
caught
sight
of
them
in
the
distance
reported
everywhere
that
large
bodies
of
heretics
were
assembling
in
the
squares
and
plotting
to
prevent
the
celebration
of
the
mass
on
easter
sunday
it
being
holy
thursday
the
communion
was
about
to
be
administered
in
the
churches
but
the
women
terrified
by
the
tales
they
heard
did
not
dare
stir
out
the
men
grasped
their
arms
the
priests
and
monks
did
the
same
and
both
pastors
and
flocks
began
to
celebrate
the
supper
of
peace
protected
by
breastplates
daggers
and
clubs
all
of
them
kept
their
ears
on
the
watch
they
were
agitated
at
the
least
noise
but
no
one
came
to
disturb
them
and
the
communion
passed
off
quietly
sidenote
convenient
interpretations
will
be
on
then
said
a
few
of
the
catholics
huguenots
it
is
well
known
are
preparing
to
make
a
demonstration
that
day
in
the
dominicans
church
where
the
monk
of
auxerre
is
to
preach
to
prevent
such
a
mishap
it
was
decided
that
the
good
father
should
preach
at
pierre
like
of
which
had
never
been
seen
within
the
memory
of
man
on
such
a
day
the
canons
believed
themselves
safe
in
their
cathedral
as
in
a
fortress
for
more
security
numerous
bodies
of
men
patrolled
the
city
one
of
the
chief
catholics
de
thorens
paraded
proudly
up
and
down
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
bravoes
on
friday
morning
priests
and
worshippers
went
armed
to
pierre
some
of
the
reformed
were
astonished
at
seeing
them
under
arms
on
such
a
day
and
reminded
them
of
our
lord
words
up
thy
sword
in
his
that
means
said
the
priests
it
must
be
kept
close
it
is
time
to
draw
convenient
interpretations
are
always
to
be
found
these
good
people
were
disquieted
without
a
cause
there
was
not
the
least
disturbance
and
the
preacher
of
auxerre
said
whatever
he
pleased
but
he
did
not
feel
at
ease
in
the
city
of
the
huguenots
and
easter
day
was
no
sooner
past
than
he
returned
into
his
own
country
no
one
dared
preach
after
his
departure
which
greatly
surprised
devout
catholics
the
ordinance
of
the
council
had
forwarded
religious
liberty
in
geneva
but
it
was
little
more
than
in
theory
the
practice
was
more
difficult
in
the
opinion
of
some
geneva
ought
to
be
entirely
reformed
in
the
opinion
of
others
entirely
catholic
men
of
decision
asked
long
they
would
halt
between
two
opinions
and
daring
partisans
repeated
that
the
sword
alone
could
cut
the
difficult
knot
the
nicholas
du
crest
and
councillor
roy
started
for
berne
to
pray
the
senate
not
to
support
the
reform
while
the
evangelicals
on
the
other
hand
desired
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
develope
itself
freely
many
had
a
fervour
of
mind
a
sincere
hunger
and
thirst
for
righteousness
their
souls
sought
after
eternal
salvation
and
they
were
as
ambitious
of
heavenly
truth
as
conquerors
are
of
glory
and
empire
the
clergy
by
depriving
them
of
their
ministers
had
reduced
them
to
simple
attempts
at
mutual
edification
but
they
desired
the
full
preaching
of
the
gospel
without
which
the
church
pines
away
are
suffering
from
want
they
said
are
deprived
of
our
rights
a
bold
monk
is
perpetually
shouting
that
he
is
prepared
to
confound
all
the
ministers
that
berne
is
willing
to
send
us
well
then
let
us
ask
berne
for
ministers
whose
learning
and
eloquence
may
reduce
these
insolent
and
prating
dominicans
to
silence
sidenote

du

disquieted
maisonneuve
who
can
tell
but
the
respect
due
to
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
republic
may
induce
the
powerful
canton
of
berne
to
take
a
false
step
he
will
endeavour
to
prevent
so
great
a
misfortune
he
communicated
his
intentions
to
the
faithful
salomon
who
being
full
of
confidence
in
his
friend
departed
with
him
immediately
on
this
perilous
journey
du
crest
and
councillor
roy
arriving
at
berne
on
the
april
fancied
one
day
they
saw
maisonneuve
and
salomon
in
the
street
they
stopped
in
surprise
eyed
them
both
from
head
to
foot
and
looked
as
if
petrified
it
was
really
the
two
huguenots
the
was
exasperated
and
going
up
to
them
asked
rudely
are
you
doing
here
are
told
that
you
have
instructions
to
speak
against
us
answered
maisonneuve
are
here
to
defend
ourselves
the
next
day
when
the
two
magistrates
went
to
the
council
they
were
still
more
surprised
to
find
the
two
reformed
leaders
in
the
outer
hall
they
hoped
at
least
to
enter
the
alone
but
no
the
door
was
hardly
open
when
the
two
huguenots
went
forward
unceremoniously
with
the
two
magistrates
and
sat
down
quietly
at
their
left
was
there
then
a
second
power
in
geneva
which
also
sent
its
ambassadors
maisonneuve
was
in
reality
an
ambassador
his
heart
burnt
for
a
great
of
the
gospel
and
of
the
new
times
the
truth
which
he
represented
filled
him
with
courage
he
rose
first
even
before
the
genevan
magistrate
had
spoken
and
said
with
holy
boldness
honoured
lords
we
and
a
great
number
of
our
desire
the
pure
word
of
god
to
be
preached
in
geneva
the
voice
of
the
gospel
so
little
heard
in
times
of
yore
is
now
resounding
throughout
christendom
and
we
do
not
wish
to
give
up
hearing
it
neither
banishment
nor
threats
can
reduce
us
to
carelessness
and
inactivity
and
then
without
fearing
the
who
was
listening
he
continued
lords
do
you
know
to
what
extremity
we
are
reduced
our
magistrates
are
making
war
upon
us
and
trying
to
drive
from
geneva
that
gospel
which
you
have
established
in
berne
after
the
visit
we
paid
you
recently
they
summoned
us
before
them
and
this
nicholas
du
crest
here
present
has
trampled
our
liberties
under
foot
and
spoken
to
us
as
if
we
were
thieves
instead
of
answering
your
letters
they
went
from
house
to
house
exhorting
their
partisans
to
take
up
arms
they
rang
the
tocsin
gathered
together
the
canons
priests
and
common
people
and
contrived
a
wicked
and
bloody
conspiracy
and
why
my
lords
we
must
they
said
cut
off
the
heads
of
those
who
went
to
berne
behold
most
honoured
lords
the
value
they
attach
to
your
citizenship
o
liberties
of
geneva
o
alliance
of
the
league
o
justice
of
the
laws
everything
is
trodden
under
foot
by
priests
determined
to
leave
us
for
our
inheritance
nothing
but
slavery
and
superstition
tears
sighs
and
groans
a
remedy
must
be
applied
and
you
alone
can
do
it
most
honoured
lords
a
fanatical
monk
who
preaches
against
pure
religion
has
offered
to
enter
the
lists
against
every
minister
of
the
gospel
you
may
send
us
do
what
he
asks
grant
to
us
and
our
brethren
one
of
your
preachers
obtain
for
him
a
public
place
where
he
may
freely
declare
the
word
of
god
let
him
combat
with
this
dominican
in
a
properly
regulated
discussion
and
thus
ensure
the
triumph
of
the
gospel
maisonneuve
knew
the
risk
he
incurred
by
speaking
with
so
much
frankness
and
he
therefore
added
you
will
also
see
that
this
just
request
does
not
prevent
our
returning
home
and
living
there
in
peace
sidenote
the
envoy
discomfiture
the
syndic
and
the
genevan
councillor
who
had
not
expected
such
a
speech
were
embarrassed
having
come
as
accusers
they
found
themselves
accused
the
angry
looks
of
the
bernese
councillors
disturbed
the
magistrate
of
geneva
still
more
than
the
words
of
the
protestant
ambassador
the
avoyer
turning
to
the
syndic
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
answer
to
make
have
no
orders
on
the
subject
and
therefore
have
nothing
to
say
was
his
reply
then
said
the
lords
of
berne
will
send
a
deputation
to
geneva
shortly
to
see
what
is
going
on
there
with
regard
to
religion

council
rose
it
seemed
as
if
a
favourable
wind
was
about
to
blow
on
the

ship

storm
was

perhaps
dash

of

in

the

of
the

may

have

it
was
to
be
regretted
that
the

the

shone
beside
those
of

if
reasoning
by
syllogism
is
bad
in

subjects
reasoning
by

is
worse
still
some
partisans
of
the

gave
a
new
version
of
the
them

come
of
the
romish
church
by
practising
a
little
of
the
them
to
go
both
of
them
need
a
little
indulgence
the
human
mind
having
been
kept
in
darkness
for
ten
centuries
required
a
lengthened
education
before
it
could
understand
that
it
is
unholy
to
employ
in
religion
any
other
weapons
than
those
of
free
conviction
sidenote
war
of
the
tongue
there
was
another
kind
of
hostility
pretty
frequent
in
those
times
and
more
conformable
to
the
manner
of
our
days
than
swords
and
use
of
ridicule
the
genevans
of
both
schools
usually
began
with
legitimate
discussions
the
catholics
alleging
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
and
the
reformed
opposing
them
with
that
of
the
word
of
god
they
debated
on
this
subject
in
the
streets
and
in
the
convents
around
the
fire
and
even
in
the
council
but
they
often
passed
from
discussion
to
ridicule
one
day
when
the
priests
were
walking
in
procession
and
singing
aloud
the
prayers
for
the
conversion
of
heretics
some
huguenots
standing
at
the
corner
of
a
street
fancying
a
resemblance
between
their
harsh
chants
and
the
voice
of
a
certain
animal
said
laughingly
to
one
another
some
thistles
to
those
noisy
braying
donkeys
exclaimed
the
nuns
in
their
cloister
make
so
many
jests
that
you
could
not
write
them
down
in
a
year
it
is
sister
jeanne
who
records
this
fact
but
her
narrative
is
so
full
of
fables
that
we
can
not
guarantee
its
authenticity
most
of
the
priests
were
stronger
in
arm
than
in
mind
and
preferred
a
fight
with
swords
to
one
with
words
that
devout
canon
and
valiant
knight
messire
pierre
wernli
was
bursting
with
rage
he
harangued
in
the
convents
in
private
houses
and
even
in
the
streets
he
wished
to
fight
and
prove
halberd
in
hand
that
supreme
respect
was
due
to
the
papacy
he
held
frequent
conferences
with
the
heads
of
the
party
both
lay
and
ecclesiastic
at

their
eyes
and
ears
open
determined
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
opportunity
to
secure
the
triumph
of
their
cause
they
thought
the
time
for
action
had
come
at
last
it
was
now
the
beginning
of
may
the
date
of
the
fair
at
lyons
at
that
time
much
frequented
by
the
genevans
some
of
the
principal
huguenots
hesitated
however
to
go
there
it
seemed
difficult
for
them
to
leave
geneva
just
at
that
moment
for
all
the
indications
of
a
storm
were
visible
in
the
sky
they
believed
however
they
should
have
time
to
make
the
little
journey
before
the
crisis
arrived
some
of
the
more
daring
among
them
posted
up
bills
with
the
words
us
go
to
the
fair
before
the
war
and
deliverance
of
geneva
they
departed
and
in
certain
secret
meetings
it
was
said
that
the
huguenots
who
remained
behind
ought
to
be
killed
and
the
gates
shut
against
those
who
were
away
thus
the
religion
of
geneva
would
be
saved
but
in
the
opinion
of
others
it
was
proper
that
the
pomps
of
religious
worship
should
form
a
prelude
to
these
combats
of
the
faith

the

on

was
exhibited
that

pretended

endeavouring

true
image
to
the
church
such

it
is
found

were
found
exhibiting

the

sixteen
centuries
as
they

who
was
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
most
important
of
the

and
was
at
the

of
the
most
bellicose
the
congregation
was
large
great
fervour
internal

ardent
prayers
rendered
the

that
day
more
than
usually
solemn
wernli
who
had
put
on
his
finest
sacerdotal
robes
presided
over
the
ceremony
with
religious
enthusiasm
and
swelling
pride
he
was
fanatical
but
sincere
his
motto
was
for
the
honour
of
god
and
holy
church
convinced
of
the
efficacy
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
he
repeated
the
chanted
the
offertory
consecrated
the
host
and
went
through
the
elevation
the
sympathetic
accents
that
rose
from
his
heart
resounded
through
the
arches
of
the
cathedral
a
fine
voice
said
some
a
fine
man
there
is
not
such
another
officiater
in
the
world
and
we
have
not
seen
so
fine
a
service
in
geneva
for
these
ten
years
after
the
mass
of
the
holy
windingsheet
the
catholics
could
not
doubt
of
the
approaching
triumph
of
the
church
a
new
contest
was
about
to
begin
we
do
not
forget
the
small
extent
of
the
field
of
battle
we
are
not
describing
the
destinies
of
the
empire
of
the
persians
or
the
romans
of
the
russians
or
the
germans
but
those
of
a
little
city
surrounded
by
a
narrow
territory
here
everything
is
on
a
small
scale
yet
the
combat
of
which
we
are
about
to
speak
led
to
the
return
of
the
and
if
the
plans
formed
between
that
ecclesiastical
prince
the
duke
of
savoy
and
the
emperor
himself
had
been
carried
into
execution
at
that
moment
as
everything
seemed
to
forebode
liberty
and
the
reformation
would
have
perished
in
geneva
would
that
loss
have
produced
no
effect
are
we
mistaken
in
thinking
that
the
great
battle
which
was
to
last
during
all
the
battle
which
the
gospel
and
liberty
fought
against
rome
jesuitism
and
the
inquisition
and
which
is
undoubtedly
the
most
important
of
modern
not
have
had
the
same
issue
if
this
little
city
so
full
of
living
faith
and
heroic
courage
had
not
fought
in
the
ranks
and
imparted
to
protestantism
the
vigour
necessary
to
conquer
formidable
enemies
when
they
hear
of
these
petty
struggles
many
of
the
friends
of
liberty
and
the
gospel
perhaps
may
say
us
not
despise
such
little
things
it
is
we
whom
the
narrative
concerns
these
people
were
the
first
to
fight
for
the
precious
gifts
which
we
now
enjoy
in
peace
wernli
did
not
intend
to
remain
satisfied
with
a
mass
he
believed
a
fight
was
necessary
he
had
hardly
laid
aside
his
robes
his
cross
and
stole
when
he
thought
of
donning
his
armour
this
was
part
of
his
piety
he
had
no
trouble
in
persuading
his
brethren
for
the
priests
were
more
zealous
than
the
laymen
in
these
disturbances
the
first
battle
having
proved
a
failure
they
prepared
for
a
second
in
the
reformation
of
geneva
facts
play
as
important
a
part
as
ideas
the
great
questions
of
rights
liberty
and
truth
were
not
elaborated
simply
in
the
studies
of
a
few
lawyers
or
divines
but
were
discussed
around
the
hearths
of
burghers
at
the
meetings
of
evangelicals
and
in
the
general
council
of
the
citizens
and
were
decided
in
the
streets
in
the
midst
of
formidable
struggles
ideas
became
acts
doctrines
gave
birth
to
events
theories
set
men
hearts
beating
armed
their
hands
and
produced
great
deliverances
there
may
have
been
some
evil
in
this
mighty
activity
but
it
was
an
unavoidable
evil
on
the
afternoon
of
the
festival
wernli
and
a
great
number
of
other
ecclesiastics
met
in
council
at
the
they
bitterly
regretted
that
the
of
the
friburgers
and
the
weakness
of
the
syndics
had
caused
the
failure
of
their
plot
they
had
lost
the
game
and
must
begin
again
a
project
adjourned
needs
not
on
that
account
be
given
up
the
catholics
should
take
advantage
of
the
time
when
the
absence
of
the
principal
huguenots
would
make
the
victory
easy
sidenote
a
holiday
evening
during
this
discussion
a
few
citizens
of
both
parties
were
promenading
near
the
rhone
apparently
thinking
only
of
taking
a
little
recreation
it
was
the
evening
of
a
holiday
and
the
setting
sun
poured
its
rays
in
floods
of
flame
upon
the
lake
the
west
was
on
fire
the
water
reflected
the
image
of
the
sky
and
flashed
with
bright
and
flickering
colours
but
the
citizens
thought
little
at
this
moment
of
the
beauties
of
nature
however
great
the
apparent
calm
without
their
souls
were
agitated
by
fierce
passions
by
degrees
they
entered
into
conversation
they
spoke
of
religion
as
was
their
custom
they
debated
with
warmth
then
they
began
to
dispute
and
to
abuse
each
other
and
finally
hands
were
raised
and
blows
were
struck
the
sun
set
the
brightness
died
away
all
grew
pale
round
the
city
and
daylight
was
fading
into
darkness
the
hour
so
favourable
for
walking
had
attracted
many
abroad
the
noise
drew
still
more
huguenots
and
mamelukes
catholics
and
reformed
hurried
to
the
molard
is
the
matter
they
asked
the
parties
were
already
forming
into
two
distinct
groups
every
one
as
he
arrived
joined
his
friends
they
arranged
themselves
in
order
they
soon
counted
their
numbers
and
two
bands
drew
up
face
to
face
some
of
the
more
impetuous
went
in
front
and
excited
the
crowd
the
gaoler
of
the
episcopal
prisons
and
his
brother
both
great
brawlers
who
handled
the
dagger
cleverly
riotous
says
a
manuscript
thorough
bravoes
of
the
century
were
among
the
most
violent
monks
and
priests
of
the
lower
rank
mingled
with
the
people
in
the
square
while
their
superiors
were
in
consultation
at
the
they
excited
the
crowd
and
complained
loudly
that
the
friburgers
had
hindered
them
on
the
march
from
destroying
the
heretics
which
they
held
would
have
been
a
necessary
severity
meanwhile
the
two
parties
though
already
face
to
face
apparently
did
not
think
of
coming
to
blows
one
pinet
sent
by
the
clergy
apply
the
match
began
to
work
upon
the
people
he
glided
from
group
to
group
and
strove
to
inflame
the
minds
of
the
catholics
will
fight
along
with
me
on
behalf
of
his
religion
he
said
then
turning
towards
the
huguenots
he
challenged
them
shouting
out
with
an
oath
creed
is
a
rascally
one
you
lutherans
if
there
is
a
man
among
you
willing
to
maintain
the
contrary
let
him
come
here
and
fight
this
challenge
was
repeated
several
times
but
the
reformed
feared
a
disturbance
has
been
made
said
they
not
break
it
some
of
them
added
on
your
guard
pinet
is
a
sad
scamp
nobody

however
the
impatient
ami

could
not
contain
himself
provoked
by
the

he
rushed
upon
him
and
nearly
killed
him
both
huguenots
and
catholics
ran
between
them
to
separate
them
peace
was
restored
or
at
least
seemed
to
be
but
a
spark
had
been
struck
out
and
the
fire
was
about
to
be
kindled

a
young
catholic
marin
de
versonay
agitated
by
the
scene
which
he
had
just
witnessed
left
the
square
and
hurried
up
the
rue
du
perron
versonay
was
a
man
of
narrow
mind
but
ardent
imagination
and
fanatically
attached
to
the
romish
church
which
he
looked
upon
as
the
sole
and
exclusive
source
of
holiness
and
everlasting
happiness
moreover
he
had
an
unbounded
affection
for
his
cousin
percival
de
pesmes
and
the
profoundest
respect
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
bishop
his
ancestors
had
conferred
great
services
upon
geneva
in
his
grandfather
aymon
councillor
to
the
bishop
john
louis
of

had
lent
his
plate
to
the

to
quiet
the
swiss

threatened
it
with
pillage
the
young
nobleman
wished
to
do
for

more
than
his
grandfather
had
wished
to
destroy

his

with
whom
the
priests
were
great
friends
urged
him
on
night
and
day
the
members
of
the
episcopal
council
the
canons
and
principal
priests
were
all
armed
and
waiting
at
messire
de
bonmont
house
the
issue
of
this
skirmish
at
every
noise
they
pricked
up
their
ears
fancying
they
heard
the
footsteps
of
a
messenger
but
none
appeared
and
everything
seemed
to
betoken
that
peace
would
not
be
disturbed
pinet
had
withdrawn
in
confusion
and
perrin
notwithstanding
his
natural
impetuosity
knew
very
well
that
the
reformed
did
not
wish
to
take
the
initiative
and
break
the
public
peace
tranquillity
was
restored
a
few
citizens
of
both
parties
still
remained
in
the
molard
but
many
of
the
catholics
and
huguenots
had
left
and
to
seal
their
concord
had
gone
to
drink
together
saying
that
they
intended
to
remain
friends
the
match
had
gone
out
young
de
versonay
and
the
impetuous
canon
were
going
to
rekindle
it
the
former
whose
imagination
had
been
excited
directed
his
steps
to
de
bonmont
house
he
knocked
violently
at
the
gate
and
shouted
aloud
help
they
are
killing
all
good
christians
at
the
sound
of
these
imprudent
words
the
canons
and
priests
caught
fire
some
remained
doubtful
and
motionless
but
pierre
wernli
good
knight
immediately
sprang
to
his
feet
the
service
he
had
celebrated
in
the
cathedral
was
hardly
over
when
he
had
thought
of
another
and
said
to
himself
that
this
very
day
the
reformation
must
be
buried
in
a
from
which
it
should
never
rise
again
accordingly
after
taking
off
his
sacerdotal
robes
he
had
put
on
his
breastplate
and
cuishes
belted
his
sword
to
his
side
seized
his
heavy
halberd
and
thus
armed
had
gone
to
the
immediately
wernli
heard
versonay
voice
he
thought
the
hour
was
come
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
priests
and
grasping
his
weapon
he
invited
his
colleagues
by
a
glance
to
follow
him
many
hesitated
and
then
with
love
of
god
says
one
of
his
greatest
admirers
good
champion
of
the
faith
seeing
that
nobody
got
ready
for
the
fight
lost
patience
would
not
wait
for
the
other
churchmen
and
went
out
first
with
fiery
courage
the
die
was
cast
the
battle
was
about
to
begin
for
no
one
was
able
to
stop
the
impetuous
canon
sidenote
the
tocsin
sounds
however
three
other
priests
less
notable
but
quite
as
manillier
and
to
pierre
and
ordered
the
ringers
to
sound
the
tocsin
loudly
and
hurriedly
these
men
themselves
alarmed
at
what
was
told
them
about
the
riot
rang
immediately
the
great
terror
of
christians
says
sister
jeanne
over
all
the
city
swelled
the
majestic
voice
of
an
ancient
bell
well
known
at
geneva
which
bears
this
inscription
on
the
rim
ego
vocor
clementia

the

and
convoking
the

and
as
for
the
whom
her
voice
was
to
affright
they
were
the
least
in
the
eyes
of
the
priests
the
huguenots
who
remained
in
the
molard
thought
that
the
papists
meditated
returning
to
the
attack
and
killing
them
in
their
houses
the
darkness
increased
the
agitation
caused
by
the
dismal
sounds
from
the
belfry

the

the
citizens

are
assembling
in

principal
square
to
plunder
the
churches
answered
some
of
the
catholics
us
rally
on
the
other
side
in
front
of
the
stalls
was
the
reply
some
said
truly
that
it
was
a
false
alarm
that
the
huguenots
had
gone
to
the
river
bank
simply
for
a
walk
as
is
everywhere
customary
on
a
sunday
evening
and
that
they
were
already
returning
home
but
the
more
violent
would
listen
to
nothing
they
hurried
from
all
quarters
summoned
by
the
tocsin
and
displayed
their
banners
on
the
side
of
the
stalls
they
shouted
with
all
their
might
here
all
christians
and
be
of
good
heart
in
defence
of
holy
faith
and
great
was
the
tumult
among
them
it
was
quite
pitiful
to
hear
their
cries
in
the
streets
the
other
churchmen
who
at
the
first
moment
had
hesitated
to
follow
the
canon
took
courage
and
leaving
the
vicar
house
descended
to
the
molard
in
the
priests
eyes
it
was
a
decisive
moment
a
great
number
of
them
no
doubt
thought
only
of
their
personal
interests
but
many
believed
that
the
issue
of
the
struggle
was
a
question
of
life
or
death
for
catholicism
in
geneva
they
shuddered
when
they
saw
those
whom
they
termed
unnatural
children
turning
away
from
the
bosom
of
their
papacy
curious
and
rebellious
minds
they
said
that
they
will
overthrow

not

with

the
hasty
resolution
of
a
moment
seeing
the
progress
of
the
reformation
he
had
vowed
to
sacrifice
everything
for
its
destruction
and
it
was
with
this
intention
he
now
descended
from
the
neighbourhood
of

to
the
molard
it

joined

proceeded
hurriedly
towards
the
square
canons
and

were
the

under
the

says
sister
jeanne
in
a
short
time
fifteen
hundred
men
of

were
assembled
during

other
ecclesiastics
were
gathering
in

in

coming
from

soon
arrived
with
hasty
steps
in
front
of
the
cathedral
the
sacerdotal
corps
immediately
barred
the
way
and
the
priests
began
to
attack
them
one
of
them
was
enough
to
receive
wounds
at
their
hands

fell
to
the

the

appeared
like
shadows
and
it
was
hard
to
distinguish

from
foes
obscure
and
confused
noises
inarticulate
sounds
marks
of
approbation
or
of
anger
issued
from
the
darkness
it
was
like
the
hoarse
roaring
of
the
sea
before
the
storm
bursts
forth
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
a
dead
silence
then
on
a
sudden
loud
shouting
when
the
canon
arrived
armed
from
head
to
foot
he
heard
the
cries
of
the
reformers
and
stirred
with
anger
he
flourished
his
halberd
and
pointing
it
in
their
direction
shouted
out
in
his

are

lutherans
who
speak
ill
of

where
are
they
with
a
coarse
oath
he
turned
round
to
his
followers
and
said
good
christians
do
not
spare
those
rascals
one
might
fancy
him
the
giant
goliath
who
with
a
helmet
of
brass
upon
his

armed
with
a
coat
of

came
forth

the
warlike
canon
had
hardly
given
the
signal
when
the
combat
began
it
was
a
fine
spring
night
everything
was
pale
and
grey
it
was
as
we
have
said
easy
to
make
mistakes
the
silence
and
obscurity
imparted
a
certain
solemnity
to
the
struggle
the
shadows
moving
about
the
molard
became
agitated
they
rushed
upon
each
other
and
dealt

was
a

flashed

the

at
the

struck
stoutly

the

john
rosetti
and
canon
viole
were
those
who
rushed
with
greatest
fury
upon
their
adversaries
all
four
fell
wounded
on
the
spot
others
besides
them
were
hit
and
their
blood
flowed
but
they
were
not
noticed
and
the
combatants
trampled
the
wounded
under
foot
until
their
friends
recognising
them
carried
them
to
some
neighbouring
house
a
blow
more
famous
than
all
was
about
to
be
struck
a
victim
more
notable
was
about
to
bite
the
dust
wernli
who
had
remained
at
the
top
of

square
unable
to
see
his
enemies
was
challenging
them
with
all
the
strength
of
his
lungs
are
they
he
kept
on
shouting
and
swearing
are
these
lutherans
who
speak
ill
of
our
law
some
huguenots
who
were
not
in
the
square
but
in
the
rue
de

all
the
adjoining
streets
were
full
of

who
could

in

in
the
direction
whence
the
reply
came
he
reached
his
enemies
striking
them
with
the
head
and
the
butt
of
his
weapon
which
he
handled
as
easily
as
his
breviary
by
killing
lutherans
he
hoped
to
kill
lutheranism
itself
the
huguenots
whom
he
had
attacked

not
remain
idle

parried
the

blows
with
their
naked
swords
at

one
of
them
whom
the
long
and
pointed
blade
provoked
sprang
forward
caught
hold
of
the
halberd
broke
it
in

and
flung
the
pieces
away
the
hero
of
the
clergy
finding
himself
deprived
of
his
favourite
weapon
lost
not
a
moment
he
drew
his
sword
and
rushed
upon
his
adversaries
cutting
and
thrusting
like
a
switzer

themselves
so
vigorously
attacked

fell

says
sister
jeanne

adds
he
defended
himself
valiantly
his

protected
his
body
from
the

to
the
waist
so
that
all
the
blows
aimed
at
him
glanced
off
completely
and
cunningly
was

a
man
named
pierre

is
believed
a
poor
carman
impatient
at
the
long
struggle

a
soldier

approached
him
and
moving
round
him
in
search
of
the
weak
point
in
his
armour
plunged
his
sword
into
his
body
the
canon
staggered
and
fell

the
blasphemer
killed
and
he
lay
in
the
square
without
moving

the
struggle
occurred
in

of
the
house
of

chautemps

of
the
most
zealous
of

evangelicals

death

the
death
of

did
not
however
put
an
end
to
the
fight
priests
with
their
partisans
and
huguenots
were
still
exchanging
blows
when
the
syndic
of
the
guard
the
head
of
the
military
department
arrived
he
raised
his
official
bâton
and
ordered
the
citizens
to

they
both
exclaimed
all
their
calling
was
useless
so
great
was
the
popular
emotion
and
so
inflamed
was
their
courage
says
the
chronicle
the
syndic
advancing
into
the
midst
of
the
combatants
conjured
them
to
separate
but
he
received
a
blow
on
the
head
from
the
hands
of
a
priest
what
the
canon
death
had
not

this
incident
put
an
end
to
the
contest
the
reformed
full
of
respect
for
the
syndic
sheathed
their
swords
and
withdrew
to
their
homes
some
priests
however
with
a
few
of
their
partisans
refused
to
obey
they
were
unwilling
to
fail
this
time
and
did
not
intend
that
their
project
should
come
to
nothing
they
were
determined
to
bury
the
reform
exasperated
bands
paraded
the
streets
challenging
and
insulting
the
huguenots
who
refused
to
chastise
the
braggart
priests
even
this
forbearance
did
not
appease
the
fanatics
they
continued
their
provocations
until
daybreak
night
the
christians
were
under
arms
says
sister
jeanne
those
wicked
dogs
but
it
was
of
no
good
for
they
were
all
hidden
when
daylight
began
to
appear
the
clergy
and
their
allies
fatigued
with
the
tumultuous
night
went
off
to
bed
and
thus
ended
their
second
attack
now
they
will
try
to
obtain
by
intrigue
and
terror
what

against

wernli
death
was
to
be
fruitful
in
serious
consequences
the
priests
were
about
to
show
what
the
violent
death
of
an
ecclesiastic
might
mean
and
the
terrible
consequences
it
carries
with
it
to
sacrifice
the
liberties
of
geneva
and
the
evangelical
reformation
on
his
tomb
was
in
their
opinion
the
only
offering
that
could
appease
heaven
next
morning
at
sunrise
a
few
citizens
left
their
houses
and
proceeded
towards
the
field
of
battle
they
perceived
a
man
dressed
like
a
warrior
lying
on
the
steps
of
a
house
a
great
sword
lay
a
few
paces
off
they
approached
stooped
down
and
touched
him
he
was
stark
dead
it
was
the
canon
messire
pierre
wernli
his
body
had
lain
all
night
in
the
street
unobserved
by
every
one
as
councillor
chautemps
a
peaceable
man
had
remained
indoors
the
body
had
not
been
perceived
the
cuirass
bore
the
marks
of
the
blows
received
by
the
champion
of
the
priests
his
garments
were
bloody
and
his
features
still
wore
a
fierce
look
those
who
gazed
upon
him
were
moved
a
canon
a
chief
of
the
church
he
who
the
day
before
had
officiated
with
so
much
state
at
pierre
surrounded
by
all
the
pomps
of
the
service
had
been
struck
down
by
the
huguenots
and
there
he
lay
dead
some
ran
off
to
spread
the
news
pierre
lies
bathed
in
blood
near
the
molard
canons
and
priests
monks
and
mamelukes
and
even
the
huguenots
ran
out
and
surrounded
the
dead
body
the
city
was
troubled
when
they
found
the
corpse
the
devout
knelt
down
and
striking
their
breasts
exclaimed
with
tears
blessed
martyr
sacrificed
to
god
according
to
some
good
catholics
he
took
his
place
in
the
ranks
of
the
confessors
who
like
thomas
à
becket
had
been
put
to
death
for
honouring
the
holy
roman
church
this
species
of
canonisation
disgusted
the
huguenots
they
said
priest
fights
with
the
halberd
and
sheds
the
blood
of
turns
soldier
and
you
make
him
a
saint
rather
recognise
in
his
death
the
just
judgment
of
god
at
that
moment
there
came
up
a
woman
of
mean
appearance
who
fell
shrieking
on
the
body
she
pressed
it
in
her
arms
with
many
sighs
and
groans
she
was
the
housekeeper
they
said
but
the
manuscript
which
records
this
incident
gives
her
a
more
significant
name
this
death
was
a
great
event
and
the
members
of
the
council
felt
the
liveliest
apprehensions
wernli
was
not
only
a
canon
but
a
friburger
and
belonged
to
a
powerful
family
what
would
not
be
the
wrath
of
his
we
known
of
this
murder
last
evening
said
the
mamelukes
sword
would
have
taken
vengeance
on
messire
assassins
and
the
night
would
have
been
a
night
of
terror
and
death
their
rage
would
have
been
so
great
that
they
would
have
entered
every
house
and
made
a
general
massacre
but
the
abler
men
of
the
party
made
less
noise
and
thought
of
the
advantage
they
might
derive
from
the
catastrophe
the
most
extreme
measures
now
became
legitimate
and
the
canon
death
was
to
result
in
the
triumph
of
the
pope
even
now
a
few
catholics
assembling
round
the
corpse
traded
upon
the
scene
and
uncovering
wernli
wounds
pointed
them
out
to
the
people
and
thus
sought
to
arouse
their
anger
others
succeeded
in
preventing
the
gates
from
being
opened
lest
the
huguenots
who
had
crossed
swords
with
the
canon
should
escape
when
the
reformed
learnt
that
the
city
was
closed
although
it
was
broad
daylight
they
asked
if
it
was
intended
to
murder
them
and
some
immediately
armed
themselves
and
went
to
baudichon
de
la
maisonneuve
house
sidenote
burying
the
dead
about
nine
the
body
was
lifted
up
and
carried
into
house
where
it
was
placed
decently
on
a
bed
the
cuirass
was
taken
off
the
stains
of
blood
washed
away
it
was
arrayed
in
the
canonical
robes
and
the
devout
folks
knelt
around
it
every
moment
other
catholics
men
and
women
took
the
places
of
those
who
left
the
same
day
at
five
in
the
afternoon
an
immense
procession
descended
from
pierre
to
do
honour
to
this
martyr
the
priests
placed
the
canon
on
a
showy
bier
and
when
they
came
out
of
the
house
people
uttered
a
loud
cry
some
of
the
reformed
joined
in
the
funeral
train
all
enmity
they
thought
should
perish
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
the
body
was
taken
into
the
cathedral
and
buried
at
the
foot
of
the
great
crucifix
the
council
wishing
to
hold
the
balance
even
imprisoned
a
few
men
who
passed
for
the
most
violent
of
both
parties
sidenote
wernli
relations
arrive
five
days
later
a
herald
from
friburg
and
many
of
wernli
relatives
appeared
in
deep
mourning
and
demanded
that
the
body
should
be
given
up
to
them
they
also
called
for
signal
reparation
at
five
the
same
day
the
body
was
exhumed
in
the
presence
of
an
immense
crowd
and
wonder
the
canon
stood
upright
and
the
blood
flowed
from
his
wound
as
fresh
as
if
he
had
been
alive
a
truth
said
those
in
the
cathedral
is
a
miracle
a
testimony
borne
to
the
holy
roman
faith
for
the
maintenance
of
which
his
body
was
mangled
his
blood
cries
for
revenge
but
the
reformed
said
that
popery
is
full
of
such
cheats
and
idle
dreams
opposed
to
common
sense
by
means
of
which
impostors
deceive
the
simple
they
believed
that
when
the
son
of
god
became
man
many
signs
of
divine
power
had
accompanied
that
great
miracle
and
that
if
the
sun
acts
upon
the
earth
and
transforms
a
poor
grain
of
wheat
into
a
magnificent
ear
of
corn
it
is
very
reasonable
to
admit
that
he
who
created
the
sun
exercises
his
sovereign
action
here
whenever
he
wills
it
and
effects
transformations
still
more
marvellous
but
they
would
not
suffer
the
tricks
of
men
to
be
placed
in
the
same
rank
with
the
interventions
of
the
supreme
power
of
the
creator
the
miracle
having
been
confirmed
by
hundred
says
sister
jeanne
the
body
was
laid
in
a
coffin
and
carried
to
the
lake
all
the
priests
singing
while
the
women
and
some
of
the
devout
made
the
air
with
their
cries
and
groans
the
coffin
was
placed
in
a
boat
and
taken
to
friburg
sidenote
the
reform
must
be
crushed
the
priests
thought
the
moment
had
now
come
for
getting
rid
of
the
evangelicals
for
ever
at
first
the
reform
had
been
a
mere
thread
of
water
but
the
thread
had
suddenly
increased
and
become
like
an
alpine
torrent
which
if
it
were
not
checked
would
overthrow
the
altars
and
sweep
away
crosses
images
and
holy
water
priests
and
prelates
had
not
an
illustrious
canon
been
attacked
and
carried
away
by
this
devastating
flood
said
the
priests
be
accomplished
what
our
lord
told
the
apostles
he
that
hath
no
sword
let
him
sell
his
garment
and
buy
one
if
we
do
not
crush
these
accursed
lutherans
now
they
will
never
cease
to
trouble
the
churches
to
plunder
beat
and
kill
let
us
sell
everything
even
our
wallets
to
procure
spears
and
swords
they
set
the
example
they
never
went
out
except
well
supplied
with
arms
under
their
frocks
the
sisters
of
claire
and
all
the
devout
women
of
geneva
exclaimed
with
delight
on
seeing
the
clergy
so
resolved
if
the
clerks
were
not
so
these
ravening
wolves
would
exterminate
us
but
the
more
reasonable
of
the
men
saw
that
the
clubs
of
the
priests
would
not
suffice
alone
hour
is
come
said
they
at
geneva
and
friburg
at
chambery
and
wherever
rome
had
faithful
followers
bishop
must
return
to
geneva
and
resume
his
former
authority
a
deputation
started
from
friburg
for
arbois
to
entreat
pierre
de
la
baume
to
return
to
his
episcopal
city
sidenote
the
bishop
at
arbois
since
the
death
of
besançon
hugues
the
bishop
had
taken
no
steps
to
recover
his
power
wounded
by
what
had
occurred
in
his
principality
he
kept
his
vexation
to
himself
made
up
his
mind
to
remain
quiet
and
sought
consolation
at
arbois
in
good
living
have
received
your
capons
he
wrote
me
some
fish
i
have
been
enjoying
myself
and
am
much
better
supplied
with
provisions
here
than
at
geneva
he
was
at
heart
neither
wicked
nor
cruel
he
had
taste
education
and
talent
and
his
conversation
abounded
in
wit
but
he
had
two
table
and
money
besides
a
weak
and
selfish
temper
which
made
him
incline
one
time
to
the
duke
another
to
geneva
and
appear
servile
or
tyrannical
according
as
he
hoped
to
obtain
anything
by
baseness
or
by
despotism
the
genevans
and
particularly
the
huguenots
knew
him
well
wants
to
ride
and
lead
the
said
robert
vandel
does
nothing
except
for
his
own
advantage
when
the
friburgers
arrived
at
arbois
they
drew
him
from
his
stupid
tranquillity
disturbed
his
feasting
and
firmly
represented
to
him
that
they
wanted
to
know
whether
he
desired
to
maintain
catholicism
in
geneva
or
to
let
it
perish
they
even
attacked
him
with
personal
arguments
which
they
knew
must
have
great
force
for
him
to
your
city
my
lord
they
said
recover
your
lost
authority
and
protect
your
threatened
rents
but
la
baume
was
too
timid
and
would
willingly
have
lived
anywhere
except
in
his
own
diocese
and
principality
he
defended
his
absenteeism
in
a
singular
manner
of
these
heretics
have
uttered
great
threats
against
me
he
said
will
kill
me
like
poor
wernli
a
mightier
voice
than
that
of
friburg
now
made
itself
heard
the
condition
of
geneva
was
known
in
all
catholic
countries
men
were
uneasy
everywhere
even
pope
clement
vii
felt
anxious
he
did
not
admire
those
ecclesiastics
who
following
the
example
of
leo
neglected
business
for
pleasure
in
some
places
the
catholics
imagined
that
if
the
reform
were
crushed
in
geneva
the
recoil
would
act
on
the
reformation
in
general
that
the
other
protestant
nations
would
feel
its
effects
and
that
such
a
defeat
would
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
representations
to
this
effect
reached
the
pope
from
every
side
and
he
being
a
skilful
politician
and
having
the
saving
of
the
roman
court
at
heart
wrote
to
the
bishop
command
you
to
proceed
to
geneva
immediately
you
receive
this
bull
under
pain
of
excommunication
is
it
not
singular
that
you
pass
your
life
in
a
foreign
province
as
if
you
were
not
the
pastor
of
that
city
you
by
your
absence
are
the
cause
of
all
the
misfortunes
with
which
it
is
afflicted
go
speak
act
defend
the
flock
which
jesus
christ
and
the
holy
see
have
entrusted
to
you
and
rescue
your
sheep
from
the
ravening
wolf
that
is
preparing
to
devour
them
the
poor
bishop
when
he
read
the
bull
was
seized
with
the
most
violent
emotion
he
saw
himself
between
two
dangers
almost
equally
great
the
pope
who
threatened
him
with
excommunication
and
the
huguenots
who
threatened
him
with
death
what
was
to
be
done
he
was
urged
on
both
sides
at
last
he
formed
an
heroic
decision
and
determined
to
obey
the
pope
he
will
leave
arbois
and
the
pleasant
life
he
had
led
there
with
all
its
earthly
advantages
and
go
to
that
terrible
city
which
appears
to
him
inhabited
by
wild
beasts
thirsting
for
his
blood
you
must
obtain
a
for
me
from
messieurs
of
geneva
he
said
to
the
friburg
ambassadors
who
were
greatly
surprised
at
having
to
ask
a
for
a
prince
who
desired
to
visit
his
principality
for
a
bishop
who
desired
to
enter
his
diocese
however
they
promised
everything
sidenote
the
bishop
invited
to
return
wernli
death
had
not
only
enraged
the
enemies
of
the
reformation
but
had
weakened
its
friends
and
occasioned
a
reaction
in
geneva
favourable
to
catholicism
the
syndics
and
council
now
leant
decidedly
that
way
and
the
return
of
the
bishop
seemed
to
them
the
only
means
of
restoring
order
bishop
does
not
need
a
they
said
let
him
come
if
anybody
threatens
him
we
will
punish
him
so
severely
that
monseigneur
shall
have
cause
to
be
satisfied
him
come
back
let
him
come
back
was
the
general
cry
except
among
the
pious
evangelicals
and
the
proud
huguenots
the
emancipation
had
hardly
begun
when
a
strong
threatened
to
stifle
it
on
the
may
the
council
elected
domaine
franc
stephen
and
bon
officher
to
go
and
humbly
urge
their
bishop
and
prince
to
return
thus
geneva
herself
was
preparing
to
bury
its
reformation
and
its
liberty
other
genevans
had
arrived
at
arbois
before
the
deputies
from
the
council
the
principal
mameluke
chiefs
whether
banished
or
emigrant
who
found
the
bread
of
exile
bitter
had
started
for
arbois
as
soon
as
they
had
heard
of
the
canon
death
full
of
that
exasperation
and
agitated
by
those
dreams
which
and
banished
men
ordinarily
have
they
endeavoured
to
make
the
bishop
share
their
hopes
and
hatred
is
juster
and
easier
they
said
to
put
the
leading
huguenots
into
prison
on
suspicion
of
being
concerned
in
the
attack
upon
wernli
they
will
be
executed
or
if
the
people
oppose
they
can
be
transported
suddenly
to
some
castle
in
savoy
as
lévrier
was
formerly
and
then
we
can
do
our
pleasure
on
them
after
that
nothing
will
be
able
to
disturb
the
holy
union
of
geneva
with
savoy
and
the
pope
but
pierre
de
la
baume
had
already
recovered
a
little
from
the
heroic
resolution
he
had
formed
after
reading
the
papal
brief
the
violent
language
of
the
mamelukes
aroused
all
his
terrors
genevans
he
said
proud
independent
and
fond
of
tumult
at
the
least
word
that
displeases
them
they
fly
to
arms
no
afraid
as
i
am
i
dare
not
go
to
geneva
not
fear
we
will
accompany
you
answered
the
mamelukes
friburgers
on
their
part
will
provide
you
with
a
guard
the
genevan
catholics
who
are
ten
to
one
will
do
the
same
the
duke
is
resolved
to
support
you
it
is
impossible
that
we
should
not
crush
the
rebels
the
calculation
was
correct
and
the
argument
unanswerable
pierre
de
la
baume
finding
himself
summoned
by
the
pope
and
surrounded
with
spears
and
spearmen
horses
and
chariots
again
resumed
an
heroic
courage
and
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
appear
in
the
city
of
the
huguenots
just
at
this
moment
the
genevan
deputies
arrived
and
the
showed
at
first
a
very
courteous
humour
and
replied
with
an
amiable
air
that
he
would
return
to
geneva
a
always
uneasy
he
still
tried
to
procrastinate
so
many
things
may
happen
in
a
finally
he
may
never
return
to
his
episcopal
city
regard
you
as
my
subjects
he
said
desire
to
appear
as
your
true
and
good
prince
stephen
a
decided
member
of
the
opposition
placed
but
little
trust
in
these
fine
words
in
reality
they
were
playing
a
little
comedy
at
the
priory
of
arbois
the
bishop
was
afraid
to
go
and
one
or
two
of
the
deputies
preferred
that
he
should
not
come
sidenote
a
coup
necessary
will
he
go
or
not
no
one
could
tell
there
were
certain
moments
when
la
baume
felt
inclined
to
cross
the
jura
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
felt
as
if
to
his
priory
of
arbois
never
was
it
more
difficult
to
arrive
at
a
was
like
a
nightmare
his
friends
began
to
deliberate
they
quite
agreed
with
him
that
if
he
desired
simply
to
his
residence
in
the
episcopal
city
it
would
be
better
for
him
not
to
go
there
at
all
he
would
always
have
to
begin
again
with
the
independence
of
the
huguenots
and
the
heresy
of
the
reformed
with
alarms
and
riots
the
evil
would
even
be
worse
than
before
for
the
cause
of
liberty
and
reform
had
made
great
progress
since
the
bishop
had
left
geneva
he
is
compelled
therefore
to
gain
two
victories
if
he
returns
first
he
must
trample
under
foot
the
franchises
of
the
people
and
get
rid
of
the
huguenots
and
second
he
must
silence
the
evangelical
teaching
and
expel
the
reformers
and
their
adherents
the
and
his
imprudent
advisers
were
convinced
that
a
and
if
we
may
use
the
term
a
were
the
only
remedies
for
the
critical
and
almost
desperate
position
of
affairs
geneva
was
to
go
back
to
the
superstitions
and
servility
of
the
middle
ages
it
was
necessary
to
extinguish
the
double
torch
of
political
independence
and
christian
truth
which
a
divine
hand
had
kindled
and
so
put
christendom
beyond
the
reach
of
these
treacherous
lights
but
the
timid
la
baume
shrank
with
alarm
from
such
a
herculean
task
he
knew
his
own
weakness
and
felt
the
enterprise
would
be
too
arduous
for
him
meantime
the
friburg
ambassadors
in
geneva
were
preparing
the
way
for
him
they
demanded
aloud
what
he
proposed
to
do
in
secret
being
admitted
to
the
council
on
the
may
they
said
accuse
all
who
were
in
the
molard
at
the
time
of
wernli
death
including
the
syndic
of
the
guard
and
the
commander
of
the
cavalry
they
spoke
haughtily
and
required
immediate
satisfaction
a
whole
section
of
the
most
innocent
in
this
affair
even
the
party
which
had
been
to
be
criminally
prosecuted
it
was
a
monstrous
demand
however
the
friburgers
spoke
loud
and
many
of
the
huguenots
were
dejected
the
council
being
divided
and
intimidated
made
answer
at
last
that
they
would
authorise
the
lieutenant
and
the
arrest
all
whom
messieurs
of
friburg
accused
thus
the
plot
was
in
a
fair
way
liberty
and
reform
had
however
a
moment
respite
sidenote
declaration
of
religious
liberty
two
ambassadors
from
berne
councillor
sebastian
de
diesbach
and
banneret
john
de
weingarten
arrived
at
geneva
and
had
conferences
with
the
men
of
both
parties
their
ideas
gradually
became
clearer
and
truth
sprang
out
of
the
conflict
of
opinions
they
saw
that
this
position
of
affairs
which
seemed
an
inextricable
chaos
had
one
possible
solution
namely
liberty
have
seen
and
heard
everything
said
diesbach
only
means
of
enjoying
peace
is
to
every
one
to
follow
the
movements
of
his
conscience
so
that
no
one
be
let
the
mass
and
and
images
remain
for
those
who
like
them
but
let
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
be
granted
to
those
who
desire
it
and
let
one
of
the
seven
parish
churches
be
assigned
them
for
that
purpose
let
no
one
be
ridiculed
for
going
to
mass
every
one
abide
in
his
own
and
moreover
as
the
old
and
new
testaments
are
the
foundation
of
our
faith
and
as
those
who
follow
the
gospel
can
not
exist
without
reading
them
let
the
booksellers
be
permitted
to
sell
publicly
the
holy
scriptures
and
any
other
books
of
piety
thus
for
all
was
the
great
salutary
principle
then
proclaimed
in
geneva
this
theory
which
gives
honour
to
god
and
independence
to
man
was
not
generally
admitted
until
two
or
three
hundred
years
later
but
we
take
note
of
the
epoch
when
the
right
was
first
proclaimed
it
is
sometimes
asserted
that
the
idea
of
liberty
for
all
only
appeared
in
the
century
and
that
it
was
put
forward
for
the
first
time
by
the
of
england
france
and
holland
it
is
not
so
religious
as
well
as
political
liberty
asserted
their
just
and
holy
claims
at
geneva
more
than
three
centuries
ago
switzerland
and
the
reform
are
the
first
in
the
field
these
principles
were
so
simple
and
so
true
that
the
council
was
convinced
in
the
face
however
of
formidable
adversaries
they
feared
their
own
weakness
the
syndics

chapter
xix
catastrophe
beginning
of
july
while
these
fine
liberal
theories
were
being
proclaimed
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
hailed
with
joy
by
noble
minds
some
enemies
of
the
reform
maintained
that
they
were
only
got
up
for
the
occasion
because
the
reformed
were
not
yet
the
strongest
party
and
the
bulk
of
the
people
who
looked
upon
them
as
mere
trash
was
occupied
with
other
things
the
report
grew
stronger
every
day
that
the
bishop
had
made
up
his
mind
at
last
that
his
resolution
was
not
to
be
shaken
and
that
in
obedience
to
the
pope
he
was
about
to
return
to
geneva
the
liberty
so
lately
proclaimed
was
therefore
seriously
endangered
sidenote
preparations
to
receive
the
bishop
every
preparation
was
made
for
the
reception
of
the
prince
whose
approaching
arrival
began
to
turn
people
heads
as
usually
happens
in
such
a
case
priests
mamelukes
and
ducal
partisans
believed
that
the
hour
of
their
triumph
was
at
hand
and
that
independence
and
reform
would
be
effectually
buried
every
man
who
owned
a
horse
had
him
dressed
as
no
one
was
permitted
to
go
and
meet
the
bishop
on
foot
the
trumpeters
rehearsed
the
artillerymen
got
out
their
guns
jacques
de
malbuisson
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
catholic
party
thinking
that
there
was
nothing
too
fine
for
a
bishop
and
prince
especially
for
one
who
was
bringing
to
the
city
as
a
token
of
welcome
submission
to
the
pope
in
religious
matters
and
to
an
ecclesiastical
sovereign
in
temporal
matters
hung
the
walls
of
the
episcopal
palace
with
beautiful
tapestry
covered
the
tables
and
floors
with
silk
and
woollen
cloth
and
filled
the
rooms
with
rich
furniture
pierre
de
la
baume
had
appointed
him
quartermaster
and
the
good
catholic
intended
that
the
beauty
of
the
decorations
should
make
the
genevans
comprehend
the
greatness
of
their
prince
if
a
servile
crowd
was
preparing
to
sacrifice
to
a
priest
the
liberties
of
the
people
and
the
word
of
god
those
who
esteemed
these
treasures
far
above
all
others
anticipated
with
sorrow
that
all
the
old
vexations
were
about
to
be
revived
the
two
hundred
were
assembled
one
proud
huguenot
jealous
of
the
political
liberties
could
not
contain
himself
and
rising
in
the
council
said
is
a
report
that
the
mamelukes
who
deserted
the
city
some
seven
years
ago
are
to
escort
the
bishop
and
return
with
him
i
ask
if
it
is
true
instantly
the
storm
broke
out
some
said
others
the
debate
grew
warm
they
provoked
and
abused
each
other
gave
one
another
the
lie
and
used
very
irritating
language
at
last
the
huguenots
conquered
and
the
two
hundred
ordered
that
the
mamelukes
should
not
be
allowed
to
enter
for
fear
that
there
should
be
discord
instead
of
harmony
in
the
city
the
syndics
foresaw
that
such
a
resolution
would
probably
excite
confusion
in
the
procession
accompanying
the
bishop
and
as
they
wished
to
avoid
all
disputes
they
sought
an
opportunity
for
bringing
minds
together
assembling
the
leaders
of
the
opposing
parties
they
entreated
them
as
a
sign
of
peace
to
dine
together
such
a
banquet
they
thought
would
reconcile
factions
and
dissipate
the
fears
of
the
prelate
it
was
an
ad
how
could
pierre
de
la
baume
be
afraid
of
men
who
drank
together
libations
were
indeed
copiously
poured
out
in
honour
of
concord
for
the
genevans
were
always
ready
in
this
respect
but
the
convictions
of
the
two
parties
remained
the
same
wine
had
no
power
to
change
either
the
champions
of
the
pope
or
of
the
people
neither
the
guelphs
nor
the
ghibelines
on
tuesday
of
july
the
descended
the
jura
attended
by
his
chancellors
the
president
de
gevigny
and
many
of
the
nobility
meditating
the
he
hoped
to
bring
about
the
friburg
deputies
the
prelate
timid
humour
went
to
meet
him
at
gex
in
order
to
protect
his
entrance
they
turned
back
with
him
and
drew
near
the
city
this
event
which
filled
the
catholics
with
joy
was
a
great
trouble
to
the
proud
huguenots
and
pious
evangelicals
and
nearly
broke
their
hearts
the
procession
seemed
to
them
like
a
funeral
train
were
independence
liberty
the
growing
inestimable
riches
which
are
the
life
of
be
carried
like
a
dead
body
to
the
grave
were
those
bells
just
beginning
to
ring
tolling
a
funeral
knell
everything
seemed
to
point
that
way
just
as
the
brilliant
escort
that
was
riding
out
to
meet
the
bishop
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
rhone
a
troop
of
about
fourscore
catholics
appeared
all
carrying
arquebuses
the
premier
syndic
who
was
watching
them
with
uneasy
look
ordered
them
to
return
are
going
to
our
prince
answered
they
with
spirit
the
magistrates
and
their
escort
lost
sight
of
them
for
a
few
moments
but
the
troop
was
again
visible
when
the
procession
got
out
of
the
city
are
the
most
violent
of
the
party
said
some
of
the
syndic
followers
will
play
us
some
scurvy
trick
a
second
time
the
syndic
ordered
them
to
return
and
a
second
time
they
answered
are
going
to
our
prince
and
continued
their
way

having
proceeded
half
a

for
the
bishop

came

the
afternoon
by
his
side
were
the
magistrates
of
friburg
and
behind
him
the
chiefs
of
the
mamelukes
banished
from
geneva
but
proud
of
braving
those
who
had
expelled
them
the
intimidated
syndics
dared
not
forbid
their
entrance
into
the
city
nor
was
this
all
the
fourscore

surrounded

in

these
bursts
of
joy
soon
came
to
an
end
the

had
hardly
entered
the
city
when
its
appearance
changed
new
faces
were
seen
which
seemed
to
breathe
of
nothing
but
revenge
at
night
conferences
were
held
at
the
palace
among
the
canons
and
the
other
partisans
of
despotic
rule
everyone
talked
about
the
horrible
resolutions
come
to
in
these
was
all
the
same
whether
the
resolutions
were
true
or
fictitious
many
of
the
reformed
were
exceedingly
distressed
heretics
felt
great
contrition
says
sister
jeanne
they
knew
full
well
that
the
bishop
brought
no
good
to
them
but
would
injure
them
as
much
as
he
could
the
prelate
was
firmly
resolved
to
have
recourse
if
necessary
to
force
banishment
and
death
but
his
character
and
interests
inclined
him
also
to
accomplish
peacefully
if
he
could
the
great
revolution
he
so
strongly
desired
he
wished
to
act
in
such
a
way
that
appearances
at
least
should
be
on
his
side
desiring
to
give
his
restoration
the
double
sanction
of
religion
and
policy
the
bishop
ordered
a
grand
procession
for
thursday
july
after
which
a
general
council
of
the
people
should
be
held
the
procession
took
place
canons
priests
and
friars
walking
in
order
sang
or
chanted
their
litanies
with
great
fervour
and
prayed
that
god
and
the
virgin
would
be
pleased
to
preserve
the
holy
roman
catholic
church
in
geneva
when
the
singing
was
over
the
general
council
was
held
the
refugees
who
had
forgotten
nothing
and
learnt
nothing
would
have
preferred
a
prompt
and
vigorous
repression
to
this
liberal
meeting
but
the
bishop
was
unwilling
to
begin
by
imprisoning
citizens
besides
the
impatient
exiles
would
lose
nothing
by
waiting
sidenote
the
bishop
at
the
general
council
all
the
bishop
partisans
proceeded
proud
and
joyful
to
the
council
of
the
people
the
magistrates
with
uneasiness
and
a
few
huguenots
with
sad
and
suffering
looks
as
soon
as
the
assembly
was
formed
the
prelate
appeared
attended
by
his
nobles
he
was
determined
to
claim
full
sovereign
power
in
geneva
and
to
take
it
by
force
if
it
were
disputed
two
great
good
pleasure
of
the
prince
and
the
constitutions
of
the
face
to
face
on
the
of
july
in
the
general
council
of
geneva
la
baume
had
taken
his
precautions
he
had
brought
several
distinguished
men
with
him
from
franche
comté
and
among
them
the
bailiff
of
dôle
a
learned
and
eloquent
magistrate
this
orator
imagining
to
win
the
genevans
by
flattering
and
flowery
language
delivered
a
very
fine
oration
but
his
burgundian
eloquence
produced
no
great
effect
upon
the
huguenots
after
him
the
came
forward
and
speaking
with
a
fine
clear
voice
and
in
very
intelligible
language
he
asked
the
syndics
and
the
people
whether
they
recognised
him
for
their
prince
and
lord
the
question
was
skilfully
put
if
they
answered
they
made
themselves
rebels
and
severe
measures
became
lawful
while
if
they
answered
they
surrendered
to
the
prelate
and
all
was
over
with
liberty
and
the
gospel
the
magistrates
who
were
careful
not
to
fall
into
a
trap
saw
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
distinction
convinced
that
they
held
their
charters
franchises
and
legislation
from
god
quite
as
much
as
the
prince
did
his
power
they
made
a
reserve
my
lord
they
replied
regard
you
as
our
prince
and
are
ready
to
obey
you
in
adopting
for
guide
our
liberties
customs
and
franchises
written
and
unwritten
which
we
beg
you
to
respect
as
you
promised
to
do
a
long
while
the
embarrassed
thought
it
essential
not
to
open
up
the
delicate
question
of
the
constitution
he
had
ratified
and
letting
alone
for
the
moment
all
that
concerned
his
temporal
power
he
spoke
only
as
a
bishop
and
delivered
to
the
genevans
a
devout
exhortation
on
the
salvation
of
their
souls
in
reality
the
great
object
of
his
terror
was
the
reformation
the
great
desire
of
his
heart
was
the
triumph
of
the
papacy
the
fear
of
god
before
your
eyes
he
said
keep
the
commandments
of
holy
church
he
knew
full
well
that
church
would
recommend
the
people
to
recognise
his
power
without
any
restriction
he
pronounced
these
words
so
devout
and
humble
a
manner
that
everybody
wept
and
the
general
council
broke
up
without
dispute
or
tumult
for
which
god
be
praised
sidenote
the
charters
consulted
the
genevans
were
not
however
ready
to
bend
their
necks
to
receive
the
yoke
the
bishop
presented
to
them
the
various
members
of
the
assembly
had
hardly
dispersed
before
the
agitation
broke
out
huguenots
and
independent
catholics
declared
boldly
and
with
one
accord
that
they
would
maintain
the
constitution
the
courtiers
and
mamelukes
alone
supported
the
absolute
privileges
of
the
prelate
despotic
power
said
one
party
resistance
to
the
orders
of
our
prince
said
the
other
offended
at
the
new
pretensions
of
the
bishop
the
citizens
resolved
to
oppose
him
with
the
antique
monuments
of
their
liberty
there
was
a
vaulted
chamber
in
the
hôtel
de
ville
called
the
in
which
the
venerable
charters
of
the
genevan
people
were
enclosed
under
many
bolts
and
bars
not
suffering
themselves
to
be
disturbed
by
the
arbitrariness
of
the
bishop
by
the
eloquence
of
his
orators
or
the
terrible
bands
of
friburg
and
turin
the
citizens
determined
to
consult
the
sacred
documents
of
their
franchises
the
syndics
proceeded
to
the
grotto
the
rusty
bolts
yielded
to
the
stout
arms
of
their
officers
they
took
out
the
noble
parchments
of
their
ancestors
and
all
eyes
were
eagerly
turned
upon
the
in
which
were
inscribed
the
duties
rights
and
liberties
of
the
people
the
roll
was
placed
upon
the
table
it
was
unfolded
and
while
the
others
listened
one
of
the
magistrates
read
the
words
written
therein
the
name
of
the
holy
perfect
and
undivided
trinity
father
son
and
holy
ghost
could
the
bishop
trample
under
foot
a
charter
which
reposed
on
so
sacred
a
foundation
the
magistrate
continued
his
examination
this
document
drawn
up
by
bishop
adhemar
in
contained
to
use
its
own
words
liberties
franchises
and
immunities
which
the
citizens
of
geneva
have
enjoyed
so
long
that
the
memory
of
man
runneth
not
to
the
contrary
the
genevans
were
moved
and
passing
the
parchment
from
hand
to
hand
read
certain
portions
of
it
and
swore
to
defend
their
rights
the
syndics
having
no
doubt
that
these
old
documents
would
be
received
by
the
bishop
with
the
profoundest
respect
quitted
the
hôtel
de
ville
carrying
their
venerable
charters
with
them
which
they
laid
before
the
prelate
they
pointed
out
to
him
the
immunities
that
were
secured
to
them
and
withdrew
full
of
hope
but
pierre
de
la
baume
did
not
care
the
least
for
these
old
papers
and
would
not
give
himself
the
trouble
to
decipher
such
disagreeable
documents
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
see
them
restored
to
the
cellar
where
they
had
slept
so
long
he
intended
to
govern
after
a
more
modern
fashion
the
reformation
on
the
other
hand
was
about
to
be
accomplished
by
maintaining
in
opposition
to
episcopal
usurpation
the
most
lawful
rights
of
the
most
ancient
liberty
sidenote
despotic
plans
the
bishop
no
longer
hesitated
when
he
had
asked
the
general
council
to
recognise
his
sovereignty
the
magistrates
had
replied
by
limiting
it
according
to
the
constitutions
of
the
people
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
renounce
all
idea
of
reigning
with
mildness
and
to
govern
by
force
pierre
de
la
baume
was
not
the
first
bishop
excluded
from
his
episcopal
city
who
had
reentered
it
with
thoughts
of
violence
tales
of
cruelties
had
been
imprinted
on
the
memory
of
the
people
in
the
tenth
century
the
bishop
of
cambray
having
been
driven
from
his
city
by
the
burgesses
who
were
exasperated
against
him
had
returned
with
foreign
soldiers
and
these
mercenaries
the
ministers
of
his
revenge
had
pursued
the
citizens
even
into
the
churches
killing
some
cutting
off
the
hands
and
feet
of
others
putting
out
the
eyes
of
some
and
branding
many
on
the
forehead
with
a
iron
about
two
centuries
later
another
bishop
also
returning
forcibly
into
his
city
his
followers
had
seized
one
of
the
most
respected
and
wealthy
citizens
notwithstanding
the
promise
to
spare
his
life
and
had
fastened
him
by
the
feet
to
the
tail
of
a
horse
which
they
forced
into
a
gallop
the
bishop
of
geneva
did
not
purpose
imitating
these
episcopal
proceedings
manners
though
rude
were
softened
he
meant
to
content
himself
with
less
he
would
have
the
principal
supporters
of
the
reformation
and
of
geneva
seized
and
would
get
rid
of
them
simply
by
the
in
geneva
as
in
the
case
of
berthelier
or
in
some
lonely
castle
as
in
the
case
of
levrier
then
the
would
exercise
without
control
and
in
his
own
way
that
sovereignty
which
appeared
to
him
absolutely
necessary
in
order
to
stifle
the
protestantism
of
some
and
the
independence
of
others
freed
from
the
importunate
antiquarians
who
put
their
trust
in
dusty
charters
the
bishop
began
to
prepare
for
the
execution
of
his
designs
he
counted
his
forces
and
felt
sure
of
victory
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
council
which
being
mostly
catholic
supported
him
at
heart
then
there
were
the
priests
and
their
adherents
then
the
friburgers
then
the
banished
mamelukes
and
finally
a
certain
class
of
people
skilful
in
the
use
of
the
arquebuse
who
would
handle
it
well
said
the
bishop
the
total
of
his
partisans
being
thus
reckoned
the
bishop
enquired
who
were
the
huguenot
chiefs
he
ought
to
get
rid
of
it
is
hardly
probable
that
la
baume
did
this
alone
or
simply
aided
by
one
of
his
secretaries
or
officers
of
justice
weakness
was
one
of
the
most
marked
features
of
his
character
he
had
no
energy
although
he
sometimes
pretended
the
contrary
but
those
around
him
made
up
for
it
the
proscription
that
he
was
about
to
carry
into
execution
was
essentially
due
to
the
encouragements
and
solicitations
of
the
enemies
of
the
reformation
and
of
independence
himself
strong
and
powerful
says
a
contemporary
on
the
part
of
the
friburgers
and
of
the
enemies
of
god
and
the
city
namely
the
mamelukes
who
were
now
within
the
walls
the
bishop
desired
to
exercise
his
tyranny
some
of
his
friends
shrank
from
such
severity
and
would
have
desired
to
divert
him
from
it
but
the
most
violent
men
prevailed
lord
they
said
exercise
his
power
against
certain
citizens
and
burgesses
and
by
this
means
extirpate
and
eradicate
the
lutheran
sect
and
heresy
sidenote
proscriptions
the
proscribed
were
selected
indifferently
from
among
the
evangelicals
and
huguenots
one
of
the
first
pointed
at
was
chautemps
he
was
not
only
a
heretic
but
his
children
had
been
trained
up
in
heresy
and
he
had
kept
for
a
long
time
in
his
house

the
translator
of
the
bible
who
had
dared
reprimand
a

preacher
in

next
at

perrin
did
not
belong
to
the
evangelicals
properly
so
called
but
he
had
been
the
chief
of
the
four
huguenots
whose
zeal
for
controversy
had
proved
so
embarrassing
to
the
vicar
of
the
madeleine
and
passed
for
the
boldest
of
all
the
band
others
were
afterwards

de
compey

in
high
esteem
although
a
savoyard
and
of
gentle
birth
philibert
was
huguenot
at
heart
the
count
of
genevois
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
confiscate
all
his
lands
and
lordships
the
poor
pervert
was
deprived
of
his
property
says
a
contemporary
there
were
still
a
few
more
whose
arrest
was
determined
on
and
among
them
pasta
and
rozetta
the
bishop
and
his
friends
all
full
of
zeal
hoped
to
catch
other
citizens
after
these
but
they
thought
it
prudent
not
to
do
everything
at
once
if
the
first
attempt
succeeded
they
would
follow
it
up
by
a
second
and
would
lay
their
hands
upon
such
citizens
as
they
had
not
thought
of
at
first
have
proscribed
all
those
whom
i
can
remember
those
whom
i
have
forgotten
i
will
proscribe
as
they
recur
to
my
mind
this
saying
of
a
great
master
in
the
art
found
its
application
in
geneva
the
bishop
having
ended
his
first
task
began
to
consider
how
he
could
lay
hold
of
the
proscribed
which
was
no
easy
matter
the
most
natural
way
would
have
been
to
capture
each
of
them
in
his
own
house
but
he
feared
that
if
he
went
to
work
in
that
fashion
some
would
hide
themselves
others
would
escape
and
others
would
be
rescued
in
the
streets
the
alarm
would
spread
in
a
moment
and
the
daring
huguenots
would
entrench
themselves
in
baudichon
de
la
maisonneuve
house
above
all
pierre
de
la
baume
was
wanting
in
frankness
he
excelled
whenever
he
pleased
in
appearing
amiable
to
those
whom
he
hated
he
resolved
to
give
them
an
invitation
and
to
hold
out
his
hand
graciously
to
the
men
whose
death
he
was
plotting
he
will
invite
them
to
his
palace
in
his
faith
but
without
keeping
it
he
will
thus
take
them
all
by
one
cast
of
the
net
then
he
will
tie
the
knot
and
the
poor
wretches
shall
leave
the
saloons
of
the
palace
only
to
descend
to
its
dungeons
it
was
thought
an
excellent
stratagem
and
preparations
were
made
for
carrying
it
out
the
next
day
july
the
bishop
officers
called
on
the
citizens
entered
in
the
black
list
and
in
his
name
gave
them
an
invitation
which
must
have
appeared
to
them
either
a
great
honour
or
a
treacherous
snare
if
any
of
them
raised
objections
the
messengers
assured
them
in
the
prelate
name
that
no
harm
would
come
to
them
some
through
candour
others
from
ignorance
and
others
also
from
rashness
proceeded
to
the
episcopal
palace
they
had
put
on
their
finest
suits
and
wore
their
swords
what
could
the
bishop
want
with
them
probably
to
obtain
some
concessions
and
they
were
firmly
decided
not
to
make
any
others
who
were
more
or
more
prudent
took
to
flight
the
clerical
riots
which
had
preceded
the
bishop
coming
the
unsatisfactory
company
by
which
he
was
surrounded
and
the
demands
he
had
combined
to
give
food
for
thought
to
minds
possessed
of
any
discernment
women
more
keen
or
more
timid
generally
see
clearer
in
such
cases
than
men
their
conjugal
love
takes
the
alarm
it
would
appear
that
claudine
levet
and
jaquéma
chautemps
felt
all
the
tender
solicitude
of
their
sex
and
conjured
their
husbands
not
to
place
themselves
in
the
cruel
hands
of
the
bishop
and
to
quit
their
homes
their
children
and
their
country
which
they
could
now
serve
better
abroad
these
two
excellent
christians

a
pious
christian
woman
firm
in
faith
but
of
gentle
character
and
she
was
spared
but
jaquéma
who
it
will
be
remembered
was
taught
by
olivetan
possessed
perhaps
some
of
that
courageous
decision
which
was
found
in
calvin
cousin
and
in
calvin
himself
claudine
was
the
woman
of
the
new
testament
jaquéma
seems
rather
to
remind
us
of
the
heroines
of
the
old
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
we
have
not
the
same
information
about
her
as
about
claudine
at
all
events
she
paid
for
her
husband
the
delicate
woman
the
wife
of
one
of
the
chief
persons
in
the
city
accustomed
to
the
comforts
of
life
used
to
the
company
of
one
of
the
most
original
french
writers
of
the
day
the
tutor
to
her
children
was
shut
up
in
a
narrow
cell
and
treated
roughly
like
a
conspirator
ancient
and
modern
times
have
witnessed
more
than
one
instance
of
conjugal
devotion
many
wives
seeing
their
husbands
threatened
with
a
cruel
death
have
been
able
to
say
to
them
et
quel
autre
que
moi

le
droit
prétendre
et
de
mourir
pour

the
reformation
also
has
furnished
many
similar
examples
as
part
of
the
huguenot
leaders
were
now
in
prison
the
bishop
and
his
confidants
deliberated
what
should
be
done
with
them
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
to
put
them
to
death
publicly
in
geneva
like
berthelier
the
simplest
way
would
be
to
behead
them
secretly
in
their
dungeons
but
that
would
be
known
immediately
and
would
create
terrible
excitement
durst
not
kill
them
in
the
city
for
fear
of
the
people
the
bishop
councillors
proposed
to
send
them
out
of
geneva
in
a
boat
by
night
and
convey
them
either
to
friburg
which
was
calling
for
victims
to
avenge
wernli
death
or
to
the
castle
of
chillon
where
bonivard
was
shut
up
or
to
jussy
near
mount
voiron
or
lastly
to
the
strong
castle
of
gaillard
at
the
foot
of
the
salève
there
do
as
they
pleased
with
them
they
decided
on
the
last
plan
and
orders
were
given
for
carrying
it
out
thus
everything
proceeded
to
the
bishop
satisfaction
as
some
of
the
principal
huguenots
were
about
to
be
sent
out
of
geneva
it
became
necessary
catch
other
citizens
after
them
and
serve
them
the
same
that
is
carry
them
also
out
of
the
city
for
the
fear
of
the
people
continually
pursued
the
bishop
he
was
planning
how
to
continue
the
work
he
had
undertaken
when
news
was
brought
him
which
greatly
troubled
him
one
of
his
agents
commissioned
by
him
to
take
note
of
everything
that
occurred
in
the
city
came
and
told
him
that
not
only
baudichon
de
la
maisonneuve
had
escaped
but
that
he
had
gone
to
berne
to
demand
help
what
a
check
what
danger
if
the
fugitive
brings
back
the
bernese
they
will
undertake
the
defence
of
heresy
it
will
triumph
the
harder
the
blow
which
la
baume
desired
to
strike
the
more
dangerous
would
it
be
if
it
failed
he
was
therefore
in
great
alarm
and
in
a
great
passion
also
he
ordered
his
officers
to
pursue
those
who
had
escaped
to
take
horses
so
as
to
catch
them
up
and
to
bring
them
back
bound
to
prison
where
their
friends
awaited
them
but
he
did
not
rest
satisfied
with
sending
after
the
fugitives
such
persons
as
were
under
his
own
orders
he
wanted
others
to
track
them
down
to
catch
them
in
the
rear
or
in
front
this
induced
him
to
make
a
very
extraordinary
demand
as
soon
as
the
syndics
had
heard
of
the
arrest
of
some
of
the
most
notable
of
the
citizens
they
had
summoned
the
council
astounded
at
the
tyrannical
act
and
alarmed
for
the
future
of
the
republic
they
deliberated
what
was
to
be
done
should
they
abandon
their
to
the
illegal
vengeance
of
the
bishop
or
should
they
revolt
against
their
prince
they
were
plunged
into
silent
stupor
when
a
messenger
from
the
bishop
appeared
no
doubt
he
had
come
to
give
some
explanation
to
make
an
excuse
and
perhaps
to
declare
that
the
bishop
would
withdraw
his
fatal
decree
no
such
thing
the
council
soon
learnt
that
he
was
charged
with
an
extraordinary
message
sidenote
strange
request
of
the
bishop
the
episcopal
messenger
having
made
the
customary
salutations
said
lord
has
decided
to
send
his
officers
beyond
the
frontiers
to
take
certain
this
was
the
term
he
applied
to
those
noble
citizens
our
very
reverend
prince
therefore
requires
the
council
to
lend
him
some
of
the
city
officers
to
accompany
his
own
and
pursue
the
fugitives
in
the
territory
of
savoy
this
was
too
much
de
la
baume
required
the
magistrates
of
geneva
to
employ
in
oppressing
citizens
the
power
they
had
received
to
defend
them
such
an
audacious
proposition
disgusted
the
syndics
they
did
not
hesitate
to
refuse
his
demand
desiring
however
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
him
to
the
last
they
gave
a
specious
motive
for
their
refusal
pardon
us
they
answered
the
bishop
we
can
not
do
it
we
should
be
afraid
lest
the
duke
whose
territories
our
officers
would
have
to
enter
should
be
angry
with
us
for
violating
the
treaties
this
refusal
threw
him
into
a
great
passion
he
believed
perhaps
not
without
reason
that
the
duke
of
savoy
would
overlook
the
violation
of
territory
as
its
object
was
to
catch
huguenots
he
said
to
his
officer
tell
those
gentlemen
to
do
justice
and
that
if
they
do
not
there
are
fourscore
in
the
city
who
will
help
me
to
do
it
add
that
they
are
to
act
straightforwardly
the
magistrates
remained
firm
but
the
prelate
found
some
little
consolation
in
the
cooperation
of
people
better
disposed
than
the
syndics
of
geneva
to
subserve
his
anger
aimé
levet
instead
of
escaping
by
the
right
bank
on
which
his
house
was
situated
had
chosen
the
left
bank
and
thrown
himself
into
that
beautiful
country
which
extends
between
the
rhone
and
the
lake
on
one
side
and
mount
voiron
and
mount
salève
on
the
other
and
where
the
wide
opening
which
these
two
mountains
leave
between
them
permits
the
traveller
to
contemplate
the
magnificent
range
of
the
alps
of
mont
blanc
was
it
levet
wish
to
avoid
taking
the
usual
road
of
the
fugitives
on
which
he
was
sure
to
be
arrested
or
did
he
intend
hiding
in
the
mountains
as
the
fine
month
of
july
invited
him
to
climb
the
easy
and
graceful
slope
of
the
voiron
or
to
scale
by
the
road
called
the
ladder
the
abrupt
walls
of
salève
whose
enormous
rocks
overhang
the
plain
that
is
possible
other
fugitives
had
done
so
levet
wandered
for
some
time
in
that
part
of
the
valley
where
the
sandy
torrent
of
the
arve
utters
a
low
murmur
but
thinking
only
how
he
should
escape
his
persecutors
he
had
no
leisure
to
contemplate
the
dazzling
vision
of
the
alps
lighted
up
by
a
july
sun
which
made
so
striking
a
contrast
with
the
gloomy
paths
he
was
then
traversing
he
knew
that
mamelukes
priests
ducal
partisans
and
above
all
the
sire
de
montagny
castellan
of
gaillard
would
follow
in
his
track
how
strange
his
destiny
only
a
few
months
ago
he
had
been
a
zealous
catholic
and
then
the
surprising
conversion
of
his
wife
had
led
to
his
now
he
was
wandering
about
as
a
fugitive
without
a
place
where
to
lay
his
head
we
can
not
tell
all
the
anguish
he
went
through
and
all
the
groans
he
uttered
he
did
not
lose
courage
however
for
he
knew
him
who
was
his
protector
and
who
maintains
the
right
he
was
assured
of
being
able
to
stand
before
god
and
his
angels
at
the
very
moment
when
men
were
hunting
him
down
he
had
wolves
behind
him
eager
to
tear
him
in
pieces

messire

a
canon
of

had
kept
his
eye
on
levet
he
knew
that
he
had
made
off
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
and
that
he
must
be
found
either
in
the
bailiwick
of
gaillard
or
in
the
parish
of

he
had
an
interview
therefore
with
the
castellan

was

anger
had
him

told
the

that

who
were
in

were
preparing
to
set
out
for

presently
a

person
came
and
informed
the

that

were
crossing

from

and
that

could

distinguished

came
from

were
felt

from

an

rose

meanwhile
the
avoyers
of

pressed
the

to

the
justice
they
demanded
and
insisted
that
the
genevans
arrested
on

should
be
brought
to
trial
immediately
the
mamelukes
cried
still
louder
than
the
friburgers
and
demanded
the
trial
of
the
eleven
persons
imprisoned
on
the
july

the
case
of

was

judicial

of

instructed

to

neither

abated
the

to

the
bishop
there
were
in
geneva
certain
nestors
of
liberty
who
uplifting
their
hoary
heads
among
three
generations
of
their
children
gave
utterance
to
words
of
wisdom
to
these
they
had
recourse
sons
to
fetch
them
and
these
venerable
witnesses
of
the
ancient
liberties
entered
the
presence
of
the
council
where
seats
were
placed
for
them
although
the
vigour
of
their
bodies
was
weakened
their
hearts
now
beat
stronger
for
their
country
than
in
their
younger
days
and
their
memory
recalled
to
them
distinctly
the
times
of
yore
accordingly
when
they
heard
of
the
dangers
by
which
the
republic
was
threatened
and
of
the
bishop
intention
to
usurp
judicial
power
they
were
filled
with
sadness
and
alarm
causes
they
said
to
the
civil
magistrate
the
practice
has
never
varied
in
that
respect
and
the
bishop
claim
to
hear
them
himself
is
a
novelty
without
precedent
the
council
of
sixty
resolved
to
send
a
deputation
to
the
prince
composed
of
the
four
syndics
and
six
of
these
aged
citizens
who
felt
happy
to
bear
before
they
died
a
last
testimony
to
the
liberties
of
their
country
if
the
bishop
laughed
at
the
ancient
papers
of
ancient
geneva
would
he
also
laugh
at
these
ancient
men
the
deputation
proceeding
slowly
through
the
streets
took
its
way
towards
the
palace
the
fathers
of
the
country
walked
with
tottering
steps
supported
by
the
younger
ones
and
advanced
towards
the
residence
of
the
haughty
priest
whom
rome
had
sent
to
the
shores
of
the
leman
and
who
was
trampling
under
foot
the
most
venerable
rights
never
had
men
going
to
plead
the
independence
of
a
nation
inspired
more
tenderness
sympathy
and
respect
people
watched
and
blessed
them
as
they
passed
and
prayers
were
raised
to
heaven
that
god
would
accompany
with
his
strength
this
extraordinary
step
in
favour
of
liberty
the
bishop
informed
of
the
movement
had
desired
to
surround
himself
with
all
that
could
give
a
specious
appearance
to
his
usurpations
and
accordingly
when
they
entered
the
hall
the
deputation
found
not
only
the
prelate
sitting
in
only
his
councillors
officers
and
the
ambassadors
of
berne
and
friburg
ranged
around
him
also
the
relatives
of
the
canon
pierre
de
la
baume
paired
the
suppliants
of
friburg
against
the
elders
of
geneva
the
syndics
respectfully
expressed
to
him
their
surprise
that
he
should
appear
to
look
upon
the
council
with
suspicion
that
several
citizens
of
note
had
been
thrown
into
prison
and
lastly
that
his
lordship
contrary
to
the
laws
had
cited
the
case
before
his
own
tribunal
but
while
the
elders
turned
a
look
at
once
mild
and
penetrating
upon
the
prince
and
their
hoary
heads
seemed
as
it
were
to
bring
the
old
times
before
him
wernli
relatives
shaking
their
black
garments
again
called
for
vengeance
declaring
that
the
prince
had
promised
to
do
them
justice
and
praying
upon
him
to
be
faithful
to
his
word
said
the
bishop
immediately
i
cite
the
cause
before
me
the
syndics
determined
not
to
give
up
the
most
venerated
laws
of
the
state
placed
before
him
the
ancient
constitution
of
the
people
and
pointing
to
the
twelfth
article
read
as
follows
no
inquisition
upon
lay
malefactors
or
other
process
whatsoever
can
or
shall
be
held
except
by
summoning
the
four
syndics
and
four
citizens
of
the
said
city
of
geneva
who
shall
be
chosen
by
the
other
citizens
and
that
the
trial
and
sentence
of
the
malefactors
belongs
and
shall
belong
to
the
aforesaid
citizens
and
not
to
any
other
persons
whatsoever
the
constitution
having
thus
spoken
the
syndic
ceased
sidenote
the
bishop
will
not
yield
then
the
elders
who
had
hitherto
kept
silent
and
whose
grave
modest
and
firm
looks
inspired
respect
came
forward
one
of
them
speaking
for
all
raised
his
trembling
hands
declared
that
such
had
always
been
the
law
of
geneva
and
that
never
in
the
course
of
their
long
lives
had
they
had
the
pain
to
see
the
prince
trample
it
under
foot
the
feeble
voices
and
calm
looks
of
these
venerable
men
added
a
strange
and
one
might
almost
say
a
heavenly
force
to
their
testimony
that
humble
speech
in
favour
of
liberty
possessed
an
eloquence
more
penetrating
than
the
most
admirable
orations
of
a
cicero
or
a
demosthenes
but
if
liberty
had
never
been
more
touching
despotism
had
never
been
more
obstinate
the
syndics
conjured
the
bishop
in
vain
in
the
name
of
the
laws
and
of
god
to
surrender
the
prisoners
to
them
according
to
the
law
so
that
they
might
try
them
conformably
with
their
office
pierre
de
la
baume
kept
repeating
can
not
i
have
cited
the
cause
before
me
the
friburg
ambassadors
begged
the
syndics
to
consent
to
the
episcopal
citation
this
time
only
but
the
magistrates
of
geneva
were
unwilling
that
the
franchises
of
the
city
should
be
violated
either
now
or
later
they
quitted
the
bishop
palace
with
sorrow
and
the
six
elders
followed
them
when
they
arrived
at
the
the
council
of
sixty
was
still
sitting
they
gave
a
faithful
account
of
their
mission
they
reported
that
the
persisted
in
his
iniquitous
and
although
the
council
felt
deep
pain
at
hearing
the
statement
no
one
flinched
these
genevans
knew
the
fidelity
that
freemen
owe
to
the
institutions
of
their
ancestors
the
ambassadors
of
berne
then
asked
to
be
admitted
importuned
by
their
allies
the
friburgers
and
by
the
councillors
of
the
bishop
these
haughty
bernese
unfaithful
to
their
renown
had
come
to
imagine
that
the
genevans
might
very
well
for
on
this
solemn
occasion
renounce
their
charter
and
their
rights
sebastian
de
diesbach
therefore
invited
the
council
to
try
if
they
could
not
to
this
citation
which
the
prelate
positively
would
not
recal
thus
the
only
allies
of
geneva
solicited
them
to
enter
voluntarily
upon
the
path
of
concessions
the
council
deliberated
and
the
sixty
were
unanimous
here
is
the
resolution
which
the
secretary
entered
upon
the
register
to
reply
to
my
lords
of
berne
that
we
will
not
consent
to
this
citation
as
it
is
entirely
contrary
to
our
franchises
and
resolved
to
ask
them
to
be
pleased
to
aid
us
with
their
advice
my
lords
of
berne
did
not
like
to
see
their
advice
rejected
but
as
they
withdrew
they
said
that
such
men
deserved
to
be
free
this
new
refusal
exasperated
the
mamelukes
they
were
determined
to
use
wernli
death
as
an
instrument
of
war
to
beat
down
the
ancient
edifice
of
genevese
liberties
to
root
up
the
foundations
of
the
reformation
and
to
establish
on
the
ruins
their
own
theories
concerning
the
absolute
power
of
the
pope
and
the
prince
consequently
they
demanded
the
convocation
of
the
two
hundred
hoping
to
find
favourable
voices
among
them
the
great
council
met
the
next
day
and
the
friburg
ambassadors
appeared
before
it
attended
by
a
great
number
of
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
dejected
gloomy
and
silent
like
the
suppliants
of
ancient
times
it
was
not
fanaticism
which
animated
the
greater
part
of
them
they
had
played
with
wernli
in
their
childhood
they
had
loved
him
in
their
youth
they
venerated
his
memory
now
that
a
terrible
catastrophe
had
stretched
him
dead
in
the
streets
of
the
city
if
they
had
been
unable
to
defend
him
in
the
hour
of
danger
they
wished
to
do
everything
now
the
hour
of
vengeance
was
come
it
was
not
sufficient
to
have
sprinkled
his
body
with
their
tears
the
blood
of
victims
must
flow
in
the
very
spot
where
the
martyr
had
been
struck
down
honoured
lords
said
the
canon
brother
justice
which
men
owe
to
one
another
is
written
on
earth
in
the
hearts
of
the
just
why
then
should
you
trample
it
under
foot
you
have
not
yet
done
justice
for
the
death
of
him
who
was
our
brother
and
our
friend
on
the
contrary
you
left
the
criminals
free
to
come
and
go
for
six
weeks
his
body
lies
in
the
grave
but
his
blood
sprinkled
on
the
stones
of
your
city
calls
for
vengeance
if
you
are
armed
with
the
sword
it
is
not
for
mere
show
but
to
strike
malefactors
and
yet
your
tribunals
are
dumb
and
your
sword
slumbers
in
the
sheath
permit
my
lord
bishop
to
cite
the
case
before
him
if
you
refuse
you
may
rest
assured
that
we
shall
seek
other
means
of
avenging
the
death
of
our
friend
and
we
shall
drown
our
sorrow
and
anger
not
in
the
waters
of
justice
but
in
blood
the
friburgers
spoke
as
if
it
were
a
murder
they
forgot
that
the
canon
had
put
on
a
cuirass
that
he
had
grasped
the
halberd
that
he
had
gone
fully
armed
to
the
scene
of
tumult
that
he
had
rekindled
the
dying
flames
and
attacked
the
huguenots
who
had
only
used
their
arms
in
legitimate
the
avoyer
of
friburg
seconded
the
eloquent
menaces
of
wernli
brother
sidenote
refusal
of
the
two
hundred
the
two
hundred
saw
that
a
war
with
friburg
and
savoy
would
be
the
consequence
of
their
refusal
but
they
had
taken
their
stand
on
the
rock
of
right
and
were
not
to
be
moved
do
not
know
of
any
guilty
persons
who
have
been
allowed
to
come
and
go
freely
in
the
city
they
said
it
be
so
the
blame
lies
with
the
whose
duty
it
was
to
apprehend
them
and
not
with
us
who
are
judges
as
for
permitting
my
lord
to
cite
the
cause
before
him
we
can
not
do
so
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
franchises
for
which
we
and
our
forefathers
have
often
risked
our
bodies
and
our
goods
the
syndic
added
that
the
council
would
consent
to
the
bishop
naming
two
persons
to
be
present
at
the
examination
but
on
condition
that
they
had
no
deliberative
voice
the
friburgers
and
mamelukes
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
accept
this
proposition
they
were
specially
vexed
that
coquet
syndic
of
the
guard
whom
they
looked
upon
as
devoted
to
the
reform
should
be
among
the
number
of
the
judges
whilst
in
their
opinion
he
ought
to
be
in
the
prisoner
dock
sidenote
arguments
for
the
temporal
power
if
it
had
been
a
mere
question
of
punishing
the
author
of
the
death
the
prelate
would
perhaps
have
trusted
to
the
syndics
but
he
aimed
at
destroying
both
liberty
and
the
reformation
in
geneva
and
for
that
he
trusted
to
himself
alone
to
supplications
threats
and
violence
some
consented
to
add
reasons
there
was
a
kind
of
argument
used
only
in
scholastic
debates
to
prove
that
priests
were
the
best
judges
both
in
civil
and
political
matters
this
strange
proposition
was
demonstrated
by
syllogism
the
major
was
is
the
best
fitted
to
judge
who
is
nearest
to
god
the
minor
this
are
nearer
to
god
than
laymen
the
conclusion
is
evident
they
had
recourse
also
to
arguments
derived
from
astronomy
there
are
two
great
lights
in
the
universe
it
was
said
there
are
also
two
in
society
the
church
is
the
sun
and
the
state
is
the
moon
now
the
moon
has
no
light
of
her
own
all
her
light
is
derived
from
the
sun
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
church
possesses
in
itself
formally
and
virtually
the
temporal
jurisdiction
of
the
state
such
arguments
had
great
strength
in
the
prelate
eyes
he
appointed
two
deputies
his
bailiff
and
his
attorney
and
sent
them
to
the
two
hundred
with
orders
to
defend
the
rights
of
the
sun
the
union
of
the
two
powers
in
a
single
individual
supplied
them
with
their
principal
argument
the
bishop
was
hardly
mentioned
in
their
speech
but
only
the
bishop
is
your
prince
they
declared
you
the
syndics
are
his
officers
he
may
therefore
command
you
as
his
subjects
and
when
he
transfers
to
his
tribunal
a
cause
which
is
in
your
hands
you
have
only
to
obey
this
theory
of
absolute
power
could
not
pass
in
geneva
are
not
the
prince
officers
replied
the
magistrates
syndics
of
the
city
elected
by
the
people
and
not
by
my
lord
he
has
no
power
to
institute
us
and
even
his
own
officers
nominated
by
himself
make
oath
to
us
whilst
we
make
oath
to
nobody
then
the
syndics
turning
to
the
friburg
deputation
continued
you
helped
us
in
the
time
of
berthelier
help
us
again
now
it
is
not
we
but
the
bishop
and
his
officers
who
alone
occasion
the
delay
of
which
you
complain
let
two
deputies
from
the
bishop
two
from
berne
and
two
from
friburg
assist
at
the
trial
and
be
witnesses
of
our
uprightness
the
bishop
persisted
in
his
demand
the
deputies
from
berne
desiring
to
terminate
the
difference
proposed
that
the
cause
should
be
remitted
to
two
judges
nominated
by
the
council
two
by
the
bishop
two
by
berne
and
two
by
friburg
the
genevans
replied
that
a
people
were
not
at
liberty
to
sacrifice
the
smallest
portion
of
their
rights
and
fatigued
with
these
endless
importunities
they
added
our
offer
is
refused
we
will
convoke
the
general
assembly
of
the
people
and
do
what
it
shall
ordain
the
bernese
knowing
very
well
that
if
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
people
no
arrangement
would
be
possible
exclaimed
do
nothing
of
the
kind
whilst
even
berne
was
soliciting
the
syndics
to
give
way
the
wives
relations
and
friends
of
the
prisoners
conjured
them
to
persevere
in
their
resistance
they
feared
to
hear
every
morning
that
it
was
too
late
to
act
is
time
to
bring
the
matter
to
an
end
said
the
syndics
to
the
bernese
prisoners
are
only
accused
is
it
just
to
make
them
suffer
as
if
they
were
guilty
go
and
speak
plainly
to
the
prince
make
him
comprehend
the
duty
which
our
liberties
impose
upon
us
the
bernese
went
to
the
episcopal
palace
but
neither
the
bishop
nor
the
friburgers
who
were
with
him
would
yield
an
inch
of
geneva
will
not
do
otherwise
than
they
have
said
coldly
answered
pierre
de
la
baume
good
and
we
for
our
part
will
not
do
otherwise
than
we
have
declared
the
friburgers
added
with
a
menacing
tone
are
about
to
return
home
and
there
we
shall
consider
another
remedy
this
remedy
was
war
the
friburg
deputies
would
return
with
an
army
sidenote
the
prisoners
in
their
cells
while
these
things
were
going
on
the
huguenots
and
evangelicals
seized
by
the
bishop
order
were
still
in
prison
bound
hand
and
foot
pierre
vandel
claude
pasta
the
sire
de
compey
domaine
the
energetic
ami
perrin
and
others
not
forgetting
jaquéma
awaited
their
fate
in
the
gloomy
vaults
of
the
episcopal
residence
in
every
house
in
geneva
and
at
the
people
were
constantly
talking
of
them
prisoners
they
said
kept
in
close
confinement
such
severity
excited
universal
compassion
and
the
secretary
of
council
mentions
it
in
the
registers
however
if
the
bishop
had
been
able
to
deprive
them
of
freedom
of
motion
there
was
another
he
could
not
take
from
them
which
was
a
sweet
consolation
for
those
who
had
received
the
gospel
in
their
hearts
they
were
bound
and
made
fast
in
the
stocks
says
calvin
while
praying
they
praised
god
it
is
of
paul
and
silas
shut
up
in
the
prison
at
philippi
of
whom
the
reformer
is
speaking
but
what
he
says
of
the
liberty
of
prayer
which
exists
even
in
spite
of
chains
may
be
applied
to
some
of
those
who
were
now
in
the
prelate
dungeons
just
at
this
time
a
report
circulated
through
the
city
that
the
bishop
was
secretly
preparing
boats
for
the
removal
of
the
prisoners
to
some
castle
it
was
said
that
certain
stout
watermen
were
ready
to
grasp
the
oar
that
an
armed
force
would
accompany
the
captives
and
that
as
soon
the
episcopal
officers
were
upon
the
open
lake
they
would
laugh
at
the
syndics
and
the
huguenots
these
reports
still
more
excited
the
anger
of
the
citizens
one
of
them
a
daring
man
named
pierre
verne
watching
the
boats
moored
on
the
shore
sought
the
means
of
preventing
this
unlawful
abduction
he
thought
he
had
found
one
simple
and
in
his
opinion
infallible
and
waited
as
we
shall
see
presently
until
the
veil
of
night
concealed
him
from
the
eyes
of
the
enemy
if
the
prince
councillors
were
contriving
how
to
get
the
huguenot
captives
away
certain
of
the
mamelukes
were
vexed
that
there
were
still
so
many
at
liberty
and
that
the
bishop
was
so
slow
in
apprehending
them
all
without
exception
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
or
rather
de
of
which
they
had
dreamt
was
long
in
coming
and
they
knew
that
if
a
bold
stroke
is
to
succeed
the
execution
must
be
prompt
some
of
them
began
therefore
to
make
amends
for
official
slowness
by
separate
acts
of
violence
sidenote
attempt
to
murder
curtet
it
was
harvest
time
and
jean
ami
curtet
or
curteti
a
man
well
disposed
towards
the
gospel
and
belonging
to
a
family
which
duke
philibert
le
beau
had
ennobled
had
gone
out
in
the
morning
to
visit
a
field
which
he
possessed
on
the
banks
of
the
arve
he
examined
the
ears
and
the
stalks
everything
promised
a
fine
harvest
knowing
that
when
wheat
is
once
ripe
there
should
be
no
delay
in
reaping
it
he
ordered
the
labourer
who
accompanied
him
to
begin
to
cut
it
but
he
was
destined
to
fall
before
his
corn
and
on
that
very
spot
a
sudden
noise
was
heard
some
men
in
disguise
fell
upon
him
knocked
him
down
beat
him
and
left
him
for
dead
in
his
own
field
the
news
soon
reached
the
city
is
some
gentlemen
in
disguise
who
have
murdered
him
said
the
people
on
hearing
the
mournful
news
the
relations
and
friends
of
curtet
seized
their
arquebuses
and
about
forty
of
them
hastened
towards
the
arve
bridge
they
raised
the
poor
man
who
was
seriously
wounded
and
bearing
their
sad
burden
returned
slowly
into
the
city
their
hearts
bursting
with
anger
as
the
procession
passed
in
front
of
a
house
where
some
friburgers
lodged
one
of
the
genevans
called
them
and
traitors
the
friburgers
innocent
of
the
attempt
swore
that
they
would
demand
satisfaction
for
such
an
outrage
but
the
sad
procession
passing
slowly
through
the
principal
streets
of
geneva
under
the
windows
of
the
chief
citizens
called
up
very
different
thoughts
men
asked
each
other
whether
the
partisans
of
the
intended
to
add
murder
to
illegal
arrest
whether
it
was
sufficient
to
wear
a
mask
and
strange
garments
to
deprive
citizens
of
their
lives
without
any
risk
to
the
murderers
and
whether
every
huguenot
as
he
was
engaging
in
the
most
innocent
occupations
might
be
suddenly
laid
dead
by
a
masked
enemy
in
the
fields
bequeathed
to
him
by
his
ancestors
while
these
dangers
were
accumulating
on
the
heads
of
the
friends
of
the
reformation
in
geneva
itself
perils
not
less
great
were
gathering
round
the
city
people
arriving
from
the
country
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhone
and
of
the
lake
reported
that
armed
friburgers
and
savoyards
were
assembling
in
great
numbers
at
the
castle
of
gaillard
and
that
one
of
the
wernlis
commanded
a
part
of
them
it
was
well
known
that
this
person
exasperated
by
the
death
of
his
relative
the
canon
combined
in
his
heart
along
with
the
love
and
respect
he
bore
to
his
memory
a
more
energetic
of
revenge
the
knights
and
soldiers
who
gathered
round
him
caught
the
infection
of
his
anger
but
not
at
gaillard
only
were
armed
men
assembling
according
to
the
reports
of
the
country
people
there
were
some
higher
up
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
at
etrembières
where
there
was
a
ferry
over
the
arve
to
the
of
mornex
others
were
assembling
higher
still
around
the
picturesque
hill
of
montoux
and
especially
at
the
village
of
collonges
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
the
same
time
the
people
who
came
to
geneva
from
the
right
bank
of
the
rhone
and
the
lake
from
the
side
of
the
jura
brought
similar
tidings
and
spoke
of
armed
men
in
the
gex
district
and
particularly
at
the
grand
saconnex
of
a
league
from
geneva
the
city
was
beginning
to
be
surrounded
by
its
enemies
the
time
seemed
near
when
the
projects
conceived
by
the
bishop
at
arbois
were
about
to
be
realised
that
prelate
who
reproached
his
friend
besançon
hugues
for
not
having
loud
enough
to
prevent
the
fall
of
his
authority
proposed
not
only
to
bark
himself
against
the
but
also
to
bite
them
one
of
those
priests
whom
rome
had
raised
to
the
rank
of
princes
of
nations
had
said
am
accustomed
to
act
vigorously
i
shall
consider
what
it
must
be
the
pontiff
was
preparing
to
fulfil
his
own
prophecies
sidenote
geneva
and
calvin
the
future
of
geneva
was
indeed
threatening
on
the
of
july
a
gloomy
veil
seemed
to
be
closing
over
that
noble
city
a
fanatical
party
was
preparing
the
shroud
in
which
it
designed
to
bury
the
independence
of
the
citizens
and
the
reformation
of
the
church
that
city
for
which
many
persons
had
already
anticipated
a
more
glorious
destiny
was
about
to
be
reduced
to
a
mere
provincial
town
occupying
an
undistinguished
place
in
the
world
and
subject
to
the
enervating
influence
of
rome
without
life
and
without
liberty
but
other
things
were
written
in
heaven
god
was
preparing
both
geneva
and
calvin
to
deliver
battle
together
on
the
result
of
which
was
to
depend
the
triumph
of
the
gospel
and
the
liberty
of
modern
nations
and
to
prepare
for
these
glorious
events
the
steps
of
the
great
reformer
were
soon
to
be
directed
undesignedly
on
his
part
towards
that
small
but
energetic
city
unique
of
its
kind
in
europe
and
of
which
the
man
of
god
was
not
then
thinking
we
shall
not
forget
that
other
nations
have
also
added
their
stone
to
the
edifice
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
from
switzerland
germany
the
low
countries
the
british
isles
france
and
afterwards
america
as
well
as
other
countries
were
to
proceed
some
of
the
acts
destined
to
secure
the
triumph
of
god
right
and
man
liberties
and
yet
calvin
and
geneva
did
something
calvin
possessed
an
inflexible
resolution
god
had
said
to
this
man
as
he
had
said
of
old
to
one
of
his
prophets
an
adamant
harder
than
flint
have
i
made
thy
forehead
fear
them
not
neither
be
dismayed
at
their
looks
though
they
be
a
rebellious
it
was
not
by
chance
as
it
is
termed
that
such
a
character
was
called
to
the
midst
of
a
people
who
had
shown
in
terrible
struggles
watered
with
the
blood
of
their
best
citizens
an
indomitable
resistance
to
absolute
power
at
the
period
of
history
we
are
describing
god
was
preparing
calvin
and
geneva
each
apart
but
the
union
of
those
two
natures
predestined
if
i
may
say
so
for
each
other
could
not
fail
to
produce
remarkable
effects
in
the
world
the
reformer
was
about
to
concentrate
in
this
little
corner
of
earth
a
moral
force
which
would
contribute
to
save
the
reformation
in
europe
and
to
preserve
in
a
few
more
favoured
spots
those
precious
liberties
to
which
all
nations
have
equal
rights
it
was
necessary
in
the
century
that
a
great
man
and
a
little
people
should
serve
as
a
centre
to
the
reformation
the
firmness
of
the
one
the
energy
of
the
other
tempered
like
steel
in
the
waters
of
the
gospel
were
to
give
the
tone
to
nations
that
were
greater
though
possibly
less
decided
and
to
impress
the
seal
of
unity
on
other
energies
how
great
a
matter
a
little
fire
kindleth
while
waiting
for
this
new
dawn
sorrow
reigned
in
geneva
the
reformers
were
expelled
their
most
fervent
disciples
were
in
prison
or
wandering
through
the
country
and
the
sword
was
suspended
over
the
heads
of
all
the
friends
of
god
word
the
mamelukes
triumphed
the
friends
of
the
gospel
and
of
liberty
asked
with
anguish
if
the
day
of
great
tribulation
was
come
at
last
the
wives
of
the
prisoners
and
of
the
fugitives
expected
to
hear
every
moment
of
some
new
tragedy
children
called
for
their
fathers
who
came
not
to
the
call
groans
and
lamentations
apprehension
and
even
cries
of
anger
prevailed
everywhere
sidenote
faith
and
hope
only
a
few
souls
putting
their
trust
in
god
preserved
some
little
hope
knowing
that
is
not
god
unless
he
is
on
a
throne
that
is
unless
he
governs
the
world
they
feared
nothing
however
terrible
it
might
be
from
the
hands
of
the
powers
of
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
agitated
hearts
and
dejected
faces
there
were
eyes
which
though
dimmed
with
tears
were
raised
towards
heaven
with
a
glance
of
hope
and
faith
