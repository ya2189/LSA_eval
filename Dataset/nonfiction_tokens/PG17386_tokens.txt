suggestions
to
teachers
the
writer
of
this
brief
manual
is
convinced
that
no
rules
can
be
laid
down
for
the
use
of
a
textbook
in
history
he
believes
that
every
teacher
will
naturally
pursue
a
system
of
his
own
and
that
by
so
doing
he
will
get
better
results
than
if
he
attempt
to
follow
a
rigid
mechanical
course
which
makes
no
allowance
for
individual
judgment
and
gives
no
scope
to
originality
of
method
the
author
would
simply
suggest
that
where
time
is
limited
it
might
be
well
to
omit
the
general
reference
summaries
see
for
instance
and
to
read
the
text
as
a
continuous
narrative
then
the
important
points
in
each
day
lesson
might
be
talked
over
at
the
end
of
the
recitation
or
on
the
following
day
on
the
other
hand
where
time
permits
a
thorough
course
of
study
all
of
the
topics
might
be
taken
up
and
carefully
examined
and
the
general
reference
summaries
may
be
consulted
by
way
of
review
and
for
additional
information
the
pupil
can
also
be
referred
to
one
or
more
books
see
the
classified
list
of
books
in
the
appendix
on
the
subjects
under
consideration
instead
of
the
teacher
asking
a
prescribed
set
of
routine
questions
the
pupil
may
be
encouraged
to
ask
his
on
thus
in
undertaking
the
examination
of
a
given
topic
say
the
battle
of
hastings
the
issue
of
the
great
charter
or
the
industrial
revolution
and
watt
invention
of
an
improved
steam
engine
there
are
five
inquiries
which
naturally
arise
and
which
practically
cover
the
whole
ground
these
are
when
did
the
event
occur
where
did
it
occur
how
did
it
occur
what
caused
it
what
came
of
it
it
will
soon
be
seen
that
these
five
questions
call
attention
first
to
the
chronology
of
he
event
secondly
to
its
geography
thirdly
to
the
narrative
describing
it
fourthly
to
its
relations
to
preceding
events
and
fifthly
to
its
relations
to
subsequent
events
the
pupil
will
find
that
while
in
some
instances
he
can
readily
obtain
answers
for
all
of
these
inquiries
for
example
in
the
case
of
the
great
charter
in
other
instances
he
will
have
to
content
himself
with
the
answer
to
only
a
part
of
the
questions
perhaps
in
fact
to
only
a
single
one
nevertheless
the
search
will
always
prove
instructive
and
stimulating
such
a
method
of
study
or
one
akin
to
it
will
teach
the
pupil
to
think
and
to
examine
for
himself
it
will
lead
him
to
see
the
inevitable
limitations
and
the
apparent
contradictions
of
history
it
will
make
him
realize
as
pehaps
nothing
else
can
that
the
testimony
of
different
writers
must
be
taken
like
that
of
witnesses
in
a
court
of
justice
he
will
see
that
while
authorities
seldem
entirely
agree
respecting
details
they
will
generally
agree
in
regard
to
the
main
features
of
important
events
last
of
all
and
best
as
well
as
last
these
five
questions
will
be
found
to
open
up
new
and
broader
fields
of
inquiry
and
they
may
perhaps
encourage
the
pupil
to
continue
his
work
on
some
subject
in
which
he
becomes
interested
beyond
the
limits
of
the
textbook
and
the
classroom
pursued
in
this
way
the
study
of
history
will
cease
to
be
a
dry
delving
for
dead
facts
in
the
dust
of
a
dead
past
it
will
rouse
thought
it
will
quicken
the
pulse
of
an
intellectual
life
and
it
will
end
by
making
the
pupil
feel
the
full
force
of
the
great
truth
that
the
present
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
past
and
that
it
is
only
when
we
know
what
men
have
done
that
we
can
hope
to
understnad

they

the
earliest
races
that
possessed
the
country
were
stunted
brutal
savages
they
used

for
tools
and
weapons
from
flint
too
they
produced
fire
they
lived
by
hunting
and
fishing
and
often
had
no

and

shelters
following
the
came
a
race
that
had
learned
how
to
grind
and
polish
the
stone
of
which
they
made
their
hatchets
knives
and
spears
this
race
cleared
and
cultivated

kept

and

the
britons
finally
a
people
invaded
and
conquered
the
island
they
came
from
the
west
of
europe
they
made
their
axes
swords
and
spears
of
bronze
a
metal
obtained
by
melting
and
mingling
copper
and
tin
these
implements
were
far
superior
to
any
made
of
stone
the
new
people
were
good
farmers
they
exported
grain
cattle
and
hides
to
gaul
france
and
mined
and
sold
tin
ore
to
merchants
who
came
by
sea
from
the
eastern
shore
of
the
mediterranean
this
strong
and
energetic
race
known
as
celts
eventually
called
themselves
britons
by
the
time
they
had
adopted
that
name
they
had
made
a
great
step
forward
for
they
had
learned
how
to
mine
and
manufacture
iron
the
most
useful
metal
known
to
man
from
it
they
forged
scythes
swords
and
spears
such
were
the
people
caesar
met
when
he
invaded
britain
years
before
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
the
great
roman
general
called
the
britons
barbarians
but
they
compelled
him
to
respect
them
for
they
were
a
race
of
hard
fighters
who
fearlessly
faced
even
his
veteran
troops
the
religion
of
the
britons
the
druids
the
britons
held
some
dim
faith
in
an
overruling
power
and
in
a
life
beyond
the
grave
they
offered
human
sacrifices
to
that
power
and
when
they
buried
one
of
their
warriors
they
buried
his
spear
with
him
so
that
he
might
fight
as
good
a
battle
in
the
next
world
as
he
had
fought
in
this
one
furthermore
the
britons
had
a
class
of
priests
called
druids
who
seem
to
have
worshiped
the
heavenly
bodies
these
priests
also
acted
as
prophets
judges
and
teachers
caesar
tells
us
that
the
druids
instructed
the
youth
about
the
stars
and
their
motions
about
the
magnitude
of
the
earth
the
nature
of
things
and
the
might
and
power
of
the
immortal
gods
more
than
this
the
druids
probably
erected
the
massive
stone
columns
of
that
strange
stucture
open
to
the
sky
whose
ruins
may
still
be
seen
on
the
lonely
expanse
of
salisbury
plain
there
on
one
of
the
fallen
blocks
carlyle
and
emerson
sat
when
they
made
their
pilgrimage
to
stonehenge
many
years
ago
and
discussed
the
life
after
death
with
other
questions
of
druid
philosophy
stonehenge
this
remarkable
structure
is
believed
to
be
the
remains
of
a
monument
to
the
dead
which
was
perhaps
used
also
as
a
place
of
worship
it
stands
on
salisbury
plain
about
nine
miles
northeast
of
the
city
of
salisbury
see
map
facing
p
it
consists
of
a
broken
circle
of
huge
upright
stones
some
of
which
are
still
connected
at
the
top
by
blocks
of
flat
stones
within
this
circle
which
is
about
one
hundred
feet
in
circumference
is
a

roof
the
recent
discover
of
stains
of
bronze
or
copper
on
one
of
the
great
stones
seven
feet
below
the
surface
strengthens
the
theory
that
stonehenge
was
constructed
by
the
race
who
used
bronze
implements
and
who
were
later
known
as
britons

to

what
we
owe
to
prehistoric
man
we
have
seen
that
the
romans
called
the
britons
barbarians
but
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
all
the
progress
which
civilization
has
since
made
is
built
on
the
foundations
which
those
primitive
races
slowly
and
painfully
laid
during
unnumbered
centuries
of
toil
and
strife
to
them
we
owe
man
wonderful
discovery
of
the
power
to
produce
fire
to
them
we
are
indebted
for
the
invention
of
the
first
tools
the
first
weapons
and
the
first
attempts
at
architecture
and
pictorial
art
they
too
tamed
the
dog
the
horse
and
our
other
domestic
animals
they
also
discovered
how
to
till
the
soil
and
how
to
mine
and
manufacture
metals
in
fact
those
barbarians
who
lived
in
the
childhood
of
the
world
and
who
never
wrote
a
line
of
history
did
some
things
equal
to
any
which
history
records
for
out
of
wild
plants
and
trees
they
developed
the
grains
and
fruits
which
now
form
an
indispensable
part
of
our
daily
bread
finally
through
their
incessant
struggles
with
nature
and
incessant
wars
among
themselves
those
rude
tribes
learned
to
establish
forms
of
for
towns
or
larger
districts
many
of
their
salutary
customs
their
unwritten
laws
still
make
themselves
felt
in
the
world
they
help
bind
the
english
nation
together
they
do
even
more
than
that
for
their
influence
can
be
traced
in
the
history
of
newer
nations
which
like
the
american
republic
have
descended
from
the
great
of
europe
for
example
parts
of
the
common
law
can
be

the

thus
the
names
of

of

the

the

originated
with

earlier

of

were
in

direct

were

they
continued
until
modern
times
to
be
the

much
of
the
western
portion
is
a
rough
wild
country
to
it
the
east
britons
retreated
keeping
their
primitive
customs
and
language
as
in
wales
and
cornwall
in
all
the
great
movements
of
religious
or
political
reform
up
to
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
we
find
that
the
people
of
the
eastern
half
of
the
island
were
usually
on
the
side
of
a
larger
measure
of
liberty
while
those
of
the
western
half
were
generally
in
favor
of
increasing
the
power
of
the
king
and
the
church
influence
of
the
island
form
on
the
roman
invasion
geologists
tell
us
that
great
britain
was
once
connected
with
the
mainland
of
western
europe
it
was
fortunate
for
britain
that
this
connection
was
severed
and
that
it
became
an
island
we
see
an
illustration
of
this
advantage
in
the
case
of
the
roman
invasion
it
was
easy
for
the
romans
to
march
great
armies
into
gaul
and
take
complete
possession
of
that
country
but
it
was
with
no
little
difficulty
that
they
sent
fleets
across
the
tempestuous
waters
of
the
channel
this
may
have
been
one
reason
why
they
never
succeeded
in
permanently
establishing
their
language
and
their
laws
in
the
island
of
britain
it
is
true
that
they
conquered
and
held
it
for
several
centuries
but
they
never
destroyed
its
individuality
they
never
latinized

they
did

and
spain
influence
of
the
island
form
on
the
saxon
invasion
in
like
manner
when
the
northern
tribes
of
europe
overran
the
roman
empire
they
found
themselves
in
some
measure
shut
out
from
britain
by
its
wall
of
sea
the
jutes
saxons
and
angles
could
not
enter
it
in
countless
hordes
but
only
in
small
numbers
and
by
occasional
attacks
because
of
this
the
invaders
could
only
drive
back
the
britons
by
slow
degrees
and
they
never
entirely
crushed
them
again
the
conquerers
could
not
build
up
a
strong
united
kinigdom
but
they
had
to
content
themselves
with
establishing
a
number
of
petty
kingdoms
which
were
constantly
at
war
with
each
other
later
the
whole
of
england
became
subject
to
a
sing
sovereign
but
the
chief
men
of
the
separate
kingdoms
which
had
now
become
simply
shires
or
counties
retained
a
certain
degree
of
control
over
the
government
this
prevented
the
royal
power
from
becoming
the
unchecked
will
of
an
arbitrary
ruler
finally
it
may
be
said
that
the
isolation
of
england
had
much
to
do
with
the
development
of
the
strong
individual
character
of
its
people
influence
of
the
island
form
on
the
danes
and
normans
in
the
course
of
the
ninth
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
the
danes
invaded
england
but
the
sea
prevented
their
coming
all
at
once
and
with
overwhelming
force
they
got
possession
of
the
throne
and
permanently
established
themselves
in
the
northern
half
of
the
country
the
english
however
held
their
own
so
well
that
the
danes
were
eventually
compelled
to
unite
with
them
even
when
the
normans
invaded
england
and
conquered
it
they
felt
obliged
to
make
many
concessions
to
both
the
english
and
the
danes
the
result
was
that
every
invasion
of
the
island
ended
in
a
compromise
so
that
no
one
race
ever
got
complete
predominance

set

sought

fame
in

hope
that

would
make
him

he
wanted

to

the

him
carry
out

their
piteous

pusillanimous
appeal

drive

the

the

forced

to
act
they
seemed
to
have
resolved
to
fight
fire
with

acting
on

they

invited

not
wait
for
a

invitation
seizing
their
spears

swords
they
set
sail
for
the
shining
chalk
cliffs
of
britain
they
put
an
end
to
the
ravages
of
the
picts
and
scots
then
instead
of
going
back
to
their
own
country
they
took
possession
of

refused
to
give

monks

them
the
power

time
that
power
did
not
come
armed
with
the
sword
to
force
men
to
submit
or

inspired
with
a
persuasive
voice
to
cheer
them
with
new
hope
augustine

the
king
of
kent
and
his
people
the
english
at
that
time
were
wholly
pagan
and
had
in
all
probability
destroyed
every
vesetige
of
the
faith
for
which
the
british
martyrs
gave
their
lives
but
the
king
of
kent
had
married
a
french
princess
who
was
a
devout
christian
through
the
queen
influence
the
king
was
induced
to
receive
augustine
he
was
afraid
however
of
some
magical
practice
so
he
insisted
that
their
meeting
should
take
place
in
the
open
air
and
on
the
island
of

the

in

hands
advanced
and
saluted
the
king

his
message
was
well
received
and
invited
to
canterbury
the
capital

there
the
king
became
a
convert
to

preaching

had
passed

of

the
north
of

however
owed
its
conversion
chiefly
to
the
irish
monks
of
an
earlier
age

had
planted
monasteries
in
ireland
and
scotland
from
which
colonies

of
which

monk
of

traveled
as
a
missionary
throughout
northumbria
and
was
afterward
recognized
as
the
saint
of
the
north
through
his
influence
that
kingdom
was
induced
to
accept
christianity
other
missionaries
went
to
other
districts
to
carry
the
good
tidings
of
great
joy
in
one
case
an
aged
chief
arose
in
an
assembly
of
warriors
and
said
o

as
a
bird
flies
through
this
hall
in

winter
night
coming

such
is
our
life
if
these
strangers
can
tell
us
aught
of
what
is
beyond
let
us
give
heed
to
them
but
as
bede
informs
us
in
his
history
of
the
english
church
some
of
the
converts
were
too
cautious
to
commit
themselves
entirely
to
the
new
religion
one
king
who
had
set
up
a
large
altar
devoted
to
the
worship
of
christ
set
up
a
smaller
one
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
to
the
old
heathen
deities
in
order
that
he
might
make
sure
of
the
favor
of
both

organized
labors
of
the
monks
gradually
however
the
pagan
faith
was
dropped
christianity
was
largely
organized
by
bands
of
monks
and
nuns
who
had
renounced
the
world
in
order
to
lead
lives
of
and
service
they
bound
themselves
by
the
three
vows
of
obedience
poverty
and
chastity
and
the

law
forbade
them
to

it
was
at

see
note
above
it
was
at
the
great
monasteries
of
peterborough
and
canterbury
that
the
chronicle
was
probably
begun
it
was
the
first
history
of
england
written
in
english
and
the
one
from
which
we
derive
very
important
knowledge
of
the
period
extending
from
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
down
to
a
time
nearly
a
hundred
years
after
the
norman
conquest
of
the
island
furthermore
we
find
that
the
history
of
the
country
was
written
by
the
monks
in
the
form
of
independent
narratives
some
of
which
are

influence
of
christianity
on
society
but
the
power
of
christianity
for
good
was
not
confied
to
the
monasteries
the
priests
took
their
part
in
it
unlike
the
monks
they
were
not
bound
by
monastic
rules
though
they
were
forbidden
to
marry
they
lived
in
the
world
and
worked
for
the
world
and
had
an
immense
social
influence
the
church
as
a
rule
in
all
forms
of
its
activity
took
the
side
of
the
weak
the
suffering
and
the
oppressed
slavery
was
then
the
normal
condition
of
a
large
class
but
when
the
church
held
slaves
it
protected
them
from
ill
usage
it
secured
sunday
for
them
as
a
day
of
rest
and
it
often
labored
effectually
for
their
emancipation
political
influence
of
christianity
more
than
this
christianity
had
a
powerful
political
influence
a
great
synod
or
council
was
held
at
whitby
on
the
coast
of
yorkshire
to
decide
when
easter
should
be
observed
delegates
to
that
meeting
were
sent
from
different
parts
of
the
country
after
a
protracted
discussion
all
the
churches
finally
agreed
to
accept
the
roman
custom
this
important
decision
encouraged
a
spirit
of
true
religious
unity
the
bishops
monks
and
priests
who
gathered
at
whitby
represented
saxon
tribes
which
were
often
bitterly
hostile
to
each
other
but
their
action
on
the
easter
question
united
them
in
a
certain
way
it
made
them
feel
that
they
had
a
common
interest
that
they
were
members
of
the
same
church
and
that
in
that
church
they
were
laboring
for
the
same
object
the
fact
that
they
bowed
to
one
supreme
spiritual
authority
had
a
political
significance
it
suggested
that
the
time
might
be
coming
when
all
the
conflicting
tribes
or
petty
kingdoms
in
britain
would
acknowledge
the
authority
of
one
king
and
form
one
english
nation
egbert
becomes
king
of
wessex
and
overlord
of
the
whole
country
somewhat
more
than
a
hundred
and
sixty
years
later
a
great
step
was
taken
toward
the
accomplishment
of
the
political
union
of
the
different
sections
of
britain
by
the
death
of
the
king
of
wessex
egbert
a
descendant
of
cerdic
the
first
chief
and
king
of
that
country
succeeded
to
the
crown
he
had
spent
some
time
in
france
at
the
court
of
charlemagne
and
had
seen
that
great
ruler
make
himself
master
of
most
of
western
europe
egbert
was
not
content
to
remain
simply
king
of
wessex
he
resolved
to
make
himself
master
of
the
whole
country
he
began
a
series
of
wars
by
which
he
at
length
compelled
all
the
other
saxon
kings
to
acknowledge
him
as
their
overlord
that
title
marks
the
beginning
in
of
a
new
period
in
the
history
of
the
island
how
britain
got
the
name
of
england
in
making
himself
supreme
ruler
over
the
entire
english
population
of
britain
egbert
laid
the
foundations
of
what
was
finally
to
become
the
kingdom
of
england
several
causes
contributed
to
this
change
of
name
we
can
trace
the
process
step
by
step
first
the
people
of
kent
and
the
great
council
held
at
whitby
laid
the
cornerstone
of
the
national
church
next
the
people
of
wessex
furnished
the
national
overlord
finally
the
preponderance
of
the
people
called
angles
furnished
the
national
name
of
or
england
it
is
a
fact
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
that
from
egbert
as
a
royal
source
every
subsequent
english
sovereign
except
the
four
danish
kings
harold
ii
and
william
the
conqueror
has
directly
or
indirectly
descended
down
to
the
present
time

alfred
the
great
of
these
sovereigns
the
most
conspicuous
during

period
of
which
we
are

was
alfred
he
was
a
grandson
of
egbert
he
was
rightly
called
alfred
the
great
since
he
was
the
embodiment
of
whatever
was
best
and
bravest
in
the
english
character
the
keynote
of
his
life
may
be
found
in
the
words
which
he
spoke
at
the
close
of
it
so
long
as
i
have
lived
i
have
striven
to
live

when
alfred
came
to
the
throne
the
danes
or
northmen
as
they
were
often
called
were
sweeping
down
upon
the
country
a
few
months
before
he
became
king
he
had
aided
his
brother
in
a
desperate
struggle
with
them
in
the
beginning
the
object
of
the
danes
was
to
plunder
later
to
possess
and
finally
to
rule
over
the
country
they
had
already
overrun
a
large
portion
of
england
and
had
invaded

the

these
terrible
pirates
despised
christianity
they
scorned
it
as
the
weak
religion
of
a
weak
people
they
hated
the
english
monasteries
most
of
all
and
made
them
the
especial
objects
of
their
attacks
many
of
these
institutions
had
accumulated
wealth
and
some
had
gradually
sunk
into
habits
of
laziness
luxury
and
other
evil
courses
of
life
the
danes
who
were
full
of
the
vigorous
virtues
of
heathenism
liked
nothing
better
than
to
scourge
those
effeminate
vices
of
the
cloisters
from
the
thorough
way
in
which
they
robbed
burned
and
murdered
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
enjoyed
their
work
of
destruction

their
helplessness

tradition
declares
that
after

he
ordered
his

to
commemorate
their
triumph
by
carving
that
colossal

of
a

on
the
side
of
a
neighboring
chalk
hill
which
still
remains
so
conspicuous

object

it
was
shortly
after
this
that
alfred
became
king
of
the
west
saxons
but
the
war
far
from
being
ended
had
in

just
begun

alfred
to
retreat
the
danes
reenforced
by

overcame
alfred
forces
and
compelled
him
to
retreat
he
fled
to
the

and
was
glad
to
take
up

for
a

so
the
story
runs
in

subsequently
he
succeeded
in
rallying

people
and
built
a

piece
of
rising
ground
in

had
to

were

than

more
than

the
discomfited

sealed
the
oath
with

admission
that

had
not

beaten
him
but
converted
him
as
well
by

the

themselves
to

was

see

p
by
this
treaty
the
danes
got
much
the
larger
part
of
england
called
the
danelaw
but
they
acknowledged
alfred
as
their
overlord
he
thus
became
in
name
at
least
what
his
predecessor
egbert
had
claimed
to
be
supreme
ruler

the
whole
country
though

highest
title
he
ever
assumed
was

translations
alfred
proved
himself
to
be
more
than
mere
ruler
for
he
was
also
a
lawgiver
and
teacher
as
well
through
his
efforts
a
written
code
was
compiled
prefaced
by
the
ten
commandments
and
ending
with
the
golden
rule
referring
to
this
introduction
alfred
said
he
who
keeps
this
shall
not

that

might
not

perish

however
still
had

he
thus
effectually
checked

estimate

considered
as
a

alfred

is
hte
most
noteworthy
of
any
in

annals
of
the
early
english
sovereigns
it
was
marked
throughout
by
intelligence
and
progress
his
life
speaks
for
itself
the
best
commentary
on
it
is
the
fact
that
in

celebrated

dunstan
three
great
reforms
long
after
alfred
death
dunstan
then
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
head
of
the
english
church
set
out
to
push
forward
the
work
begun
by
the
great
king
he
labored
to
accomplish
three
things
first
he
sought
to
establish
a
higher
system
of
education
secondly
he
desired
to
elevate
the
general
standard
of
monastic
life
finally
he
tried
to
inaugurate
a
period
of
national
peace
and
economic
progress
he
began
his
work
when
he
had
control
of
the
abbey
of
glastonbury
in
the
southwest
of
england
he
succeeded
in
making
the
school
connected
with
that
abbey
the
most
famous
one
in
the
whole
kingdom
he
not
only
taught
himself
but
by
his
enthusiasm
he
inspired
others
to
teach
he
was
determined
that
from
glastonbury
a
spirit
should
go
forth
which
should
make
the
church
of
england
the
real
educator
of
the
english
people
next
he
devoted
himself
to
helping
the
inmates
of
the
monasteries
in
their
efforts
to
reach
a
truer
and
stronger
manhood
that
of
course
was
the
original
purpose
for
which
those
institutions
had
been
founded
but
in
time
many
of
them
had
more
or
less
degenerated
every
athlete
and
every
earnest
student
knows
how
hard
it
is
to
keep
up
the
course
of
training
he
has
resolved
upon
the
strain
sometimes
becomes
too
great
for
him
well
the
monk
in
his
cell
had
found
out
how
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
be
always
faithful
to
his
religious
vows
dunstan
roused
these
men
to
begin
their
work
anew
he
monasticism
in
england
making
it
stricter
in
discipline
and
purer
in
purpose
last
of
all
the
archbishop
endeavored
to
secure
greater
freedom
from
strife
he
saw
that
the
continued
wars
of
the
english
were
killing
off
their
young
men
the
real
hope
of
the
country
and
were
wasting
the
best
powers
of
the
nation
his
influence
with
the
reigning
monarch
was
very
great
and
he
was
successful
for
a
time
in
reconciling
the
danes
and
the
english
it
was
said
that
he
established
peace
in
the
kingdom
such
as
had
not
been
known
within
the
memory
of
man
at
the
same
time
the
archbishop
who
was
himself
a
skillful
mechanic
and
worker
in
metals
endeavored
to
encourage
inventive
industry
and
the
exportation
of
products
to
the
continent
he
did
everything
in
his
power
to
extend
foreign
trade
and
it
was
largely
through
his
efforts
that
london
rose
to
the
commercial
greatness
it
has
held
ever
since
because
of
these
things
one
of
the
best
known
english
historians
speaking
of
that
period
declares
that
dunstan
stands
forth
as
the
leading
man
in
both
church
and
state
the
common
people
regarded
his
accomplishments
in
this
direction
with
superstitious
awe
many
stories
of
his
skill
were
circulated
and
it
was
even
whispered
that
in
a
personal
contest
with
the
evil
one
it
was
the
foul
fiend
and
not
the
monk
who
got
the
worst

it

a

set

began
to
make
fresh
inroads
the
resistance
to

became
feeble
and
at

a
royal

called

dane
money
was
levied
on
all
landed
property
in
england
in
order
to
buy
off
the
invaders
for
a
brief
period
this
cowardly
concession
answered
its
purpose
but
a
time
came
when
the
danes
refused
to
be
bribed
to
keep
away
the
northmen

the
danish
invasion
of

was
really
a

movement
the

had
obtained
so
large

in

tenth

established

were

founded

were

give

to
facilitate
the

of

large

with

embraced
the

see

of

districts
was
ruled
by

invested
with

royal
power

the
arrangement
worked
well

william
at
a
place
midway
between
pevensey
and

five
miles
back
from

the
advantage
of
a
stockaded
fort
he
had
built
william
that
of
a
body
of
cavalry
and
archers
for
the
english
fought
on
foot
with
javelins
and
mainly
the
saxons
spent
the
night
in
feasting
and
song
the
normans
in
prayer
and
confession
both
were
eager
to
fight
the
great
battle
of

on
the
morning
of
the
of
october
the
fight
began
it
lasted
until
dark
with
heavy
loss
on
both
sides
at
length
strategy
carried
the
day
and
harold
and
his
brave
followers
found
to
their
cost
that
then
as
now
it
is
the
thinking
bayonet
which
conquers
the
english
king
was
slain
and
every
man
of
his
chosen
troops
with
him
a
monk
who
wrote
the
history
of
the
period
of
the
conquest
says
that
the
vices
of
the
saxons
had
made
them
effeminate
and
womanish
wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
running
against
duke
william
they
lost
themselves
and
their
country
with
one
and
that
an
easy
and
light
battle
doubtless
the
english
had
fallen
off
in
many
ways
from
what
hey
had
been
generations
earlier
but
the
record
at
hastings
shows
that
they
had
lost
neither
strength
courage
nor
endurance
and

harder

by
which
he
gained

did
will
appear
in
the
history
of
the
island
several
contemporary
accounts
of
the
battle
exist
by
both
french
and
english
writers
but
one
of
the
best
histories
of
it
is
that
which
was
wrought
in
colors
by
a
woman
hand
it
represents
the
scenes
of
the
famous
contest
on
a
strip
of
canvas
known
as
the
bayeux
tapestry
a
name
derived
from
the
french
town

it
is
still
preserved
close
of
the
period
what
the
saxon
conquest
of
britain
had
accomplished
the
death
of
king
harold
ends
the
saxon
or
english
period
of
history
before
entering
upon
the
reign
of
william
the
conqueror
let
us
consider
what
that
period
had
accomplished
we
have
seen
that
the
jutes
saxons
and
angles
invaded
britain
at
a
critical
period
its
original
inhabitants
had
become
cowed
and
enervated
by
the
despotism
and
the
civilization
forced
on
them
by
the
romans
the
newcomers
brought
that
healthy
spirit
of
barbarism
that
irrepressible
love
of
personal
liberty
which
the
country
sorely
needed
the
conquerors
were
rough
ignorant
cruel
but
they
were
vigorous
fearless
and
determined
these
qualities
were
worth
a
thousand
times
more
to
britain
than
the
gilded
corruption
of
rome
but
in
the
course
of
time
the
saxons
or
english
themselves
lost
spirit
their
besetting
sin
was
a
stolidity
which
degenerated
into
animalism
and
sluggish
content
fresh
elements
contributed
by
the
danes
or
northmen
then
came
the
danes
or
northmen
they
brought
with
them
a
new
spirit
of
still
more
savage
independence
which
found
expression
in
their
song
i
trust
my
sword
i
trust
my
steed
but
most
i
trust
myself
at
need
they
conquered
a
large
part
of
the
island
and
in
conquering
regenerated
it
so
strong
was
their
love
of
independence
that
even
the
lowest
classes
of
farm
laborers
were
quite
generally
free
more
small
independent
landholders
were
found
amongh
the
danish
population
than
anywhere
else
and
it
is
said
that
the
number
now
existing
in
the
region
which
they
settled
in
the
northeast
of
england
is
still
much
larger
than
in
the
south

much
that
nation
has
changed
since
it
remains
nevertheless
in
its
solid
and
fundamental
qualities
what
those
peoples
made
it
some
authorities
insist
that
this
phrase
means
the
saxons
of
england
in
distinction
from
those
of
the
continent
it
is
used
here
however
in
the
sense
given
by
professor
freeman
as
a
term
describing
the
people
formed
in
england
by
the
union
of
the
germanic
tribes
which
had
settled
in

they
established

folkland
each
tribe
in
forming
its
settlement
seized
more
land
than
it
actually
needed
this
excess
was
known
as
folkland
the
land
and
might
be
used
by
all
alike
for
pasturing
cattle
or
cutting
wood
with
the
consent
of
the
witan
the
king
might
grant
portions
of
this
folkland
as
a
reward
for
services
done
to
himself
or
to
the
community
such
grants
were
usually
conditional
and
could
only
be
made
for
a
time
eventually
they
returned
to
the
community
other
grants
however
might
be
made
in
the
same
way
which
conferred

ownership
such
grants
were
called

because
conveyed
by
writing
or
registered
in

or

in

the
king
obtained
the
power
of
making
these
grants
without
having
to
consult
the
witan
and
at
last
the
whole
of
the
folkland
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
absolute
property

every
freeman
was

to
do
three
things
he
must
assist
in
the
maintenance
of
roads
and
bridges
he
must
aid
in
the
repair
of

he
must
serve
in

whoever
neglected
or
refused
to
perform
this
last
and
most
important
of

duties

itself
the
feudal
system
see
too
the
constitutional
summary
in
the
appendix
iii
the
essential
principle
of
the
feudal
system
was
the
holding
of
land
on
condition
of
military
or
other
service
it
appears
to
have
gradually
grown
up
in
england
from
grants
made
by
the
king
in
addition
to
the
eorls
earls
or
nobles
by
birth
there
gradually
grew
up
a
class
known
as
thanes
companions
or
servants
of
the
king
who
in
time
outranked
those
who
were
noble
by
birth
he
would
frequently
have
occasion
to
give
rewards
to
the
nobles
and
chief
men
for
faithful
service
and
for
deeds
of
valor
as
nearly
all
his
wealth
consisted
in
land
he
would
naturally
give
that
to
this
gift
however
he
would
attach
a
condition
on
making
such
a
grant
the
king
required
the
receiver
to
agree
to
furnish
a
certain
number
of
fully
equipped
soldiers
to
fight
for
him
these
grants
were
originally
made
for
life
only
and
on
death
of
the
recipient
they
returned
to
the
crown
the
saxons
or
early
english
were
divided
into
three
classes
eorls
they
must
nut
be
confounded
with
the
danish
jarls
or
earls
who
were
noble
by
birth
ceorls
churls
or
simple
freemen
and
slaves
the
slaves
were
either
the
absolute
property
of
the
master
or
were
bound
to
the
soil
and
sold
with
it
this
latter
class
under
the
norman
name
of
villeins
became
numerous
after
the
norman
conquest
in
the
eleventh
century
the
chieftains
of
the
first
saxon
settlers
were
called
either
ealdormen
aldermen
or
heretogas
the
first
being
civil
or
magisterial
the
latter
military
officers
the
thanes
were
a
later
class
who
from
serving
the
king
or
some
powerful
leader
became
noble
by
military
service
next
the
nobles
and
other
great
landholders
following
the
example
of
the
king
granted
portions
of
their
estates
to
tenants
on
similar
conditions
and
these
again
might
grant
portions
to
those
below
them
in
return
for
satisfactory
military
or
other
service
in
time
it
came
to
be
an
established
principle
that
every
freeman
below
the
rank
of
a
noble
must
be
attached
to
some
superior
whom
he
was
bound
to
serve
and
who
on
the
other
hand
was
his
legal
protector
and
responsible
for
his
good
behavior
the
man
who
refused
to
acknowledge
his
duty
to
serve
a
lord
or
superior
was
looked
upon
as
an
outlaw
and
might
be
seized
like
a
robber
in
that
respect
therefore
he
would
be
worse
off
than
the
slave
who
had
a
master
to
whom
he
was
accountable
and
who
was
accountable
for
him
eventually
it
became
common
for
the
small
landholders
especially
during
the
danish
invasions
to
seek
the
protection
of
some
neighboring
lord
who
had
a
large
band
of
followers
at
his
command
in
such
cases
the
freeman
gave
up
his
land
and
received
it
again
on
certain
conditions
the
usual
form
was
for
him
to
kneel
and
placing
his
hands
within
those
of
the
lord
to
swear
an
oath
of
homage
saing
i
become
your
man
for
the
lands
which
i
hold
to
you
and
i
will
be
faithful
to
you
against
all
men
saving
only
the
service
which
i
owe
to
my
lord
the
king
on
his
side
the
lord
solemnly
promised
to
defend
his
tenant
or
vassal
in
the
possession
of
his
property
for
which
he
was
to
perform
some
service
to
the
lord
in
these
two
ways
first
by
grant
of
lands
from
the
king
or
a
superior
and
secondly
by
the
act
of
homage
known
as
commendation
on
the
part
of
the
recipient
when
he
had
given
up
lands
on
condition
of
protection
and
had
received
them
back
again
the
feudal
system
a
name
derived
from
feodum
meaning
land
or
property
grew
up
in
england
its
growth
however
was
irregular
and
incomplete
and
it
should
be
distinctly
understood
that
it
was
not
until
after
the
norman
conquest
in
the
eleventh
century
that
it
became
fully
establised
it
should
also
be
distinctly
understood
that
william
the
conqueror
made
a
most
important
change
in
this
system
by
requiring
the
tenants
of
all
the
great
landholders
as
well
as
their
masters
to
swear
direct
obedience
to
him
advantages
of
feudalism
this
system
had
at
that
time
many
advantages
the
old
method
of
holding
land
in
common
was
a
wasteful
one
since
the
way
in
which
the
possessor
of
a
field
might
cultivate
it
would
perhaps
spoil
it
for
the
one
who
received
it
at
the
next
allotment
in
an
age
of
constant
warfare
feudalism
protected
all
classes
better
than
if
they
had
stood
apart
and
it
often
enabled
the
king
to
raise
a
powerful
and
force
in
the
easiest
and
quickest
manner
it
cultivated
two
important
virtues
fidelity
on
the
part
of
the
vassal
protection
on
that
of
the
lord
it
had
something
of
the
spirit
of
the
golden
rule
in
it
its
corner
stone
was
the
faithfulness
of
man
to
man
society
had
outgrown
the
outward
forms
of
feudalism
which
like
every
system
had
its
drawbacks
but
it
would
seem
as
though
it
could
never
wholly
outgrow
the
feudal
principle
political
divisions
the
sheriff
politically
the
kingdom
was
divided
into
townships
hundreds
districts
furnishing
a
hundred
warriors
or
supporting
a
hundred
families
and
shires
or
counties
the
shire
having
been
originally
in
some
cases
the
section
settled
by
an
independent
tribe
as
sussex
essex
etc
in
each
shire
the
king
had
an
officer
called
a
shire
reeve
or
sherrif
who
represented
him
collected
the
taxes
due
the
crown
and
saw
to
the
execution
of
the
laws
in

manner
the

the
hundred
had
a
headman
of
its
own
choosing
to
see
to
matters
of
general
interest
reeve
a
man
in
authority
or
having
charge
of
something
the
courts
as
the
nation
had
its
assembly
of
wise
men
acting
as
a
high
court
so
each
shire
hundred
and
town
had
its
court
which
all
freemen
might
attend
there
without
any
special
judge
jury
or
lawyers
cases
of
all
kinds
were
tried
and
settled
by
the
voice
of
the
entire
body
who
were
both
judge
and
jury
in
themselves
methods
of
procedure
compurgation
in
these
courts
there
were
two
methods
of
procedure
first
the
accused
might
clear
himself
of
the
charge
brought
against
him
by
compurgations
that
is
by
swearing
that
he
was
not
guilty
and
getting
a
number
of
reputable
neighbors
to
swear
that
they
believed
his
oath
if
their
oaths
were
not
satisfactory
witnesses
might
be
brought
to
swear
to
some
particular
fact
in
ever
case
the
value
of
the
oath
was
graduated
according
to
the
rank
of
the
person
that
of
a
man
of
high
rank
being
worth
as
much
as
that
of
twelve
common
men
the
ordeal
secondly
if
the
accused
could
not
clear
himself
in
this
way
he
was
obliged
to
submit
to
the
ordeal
this
usually
consisted
in
carrying
a
piece
of
hot
iron
a
certain
distance
or
in
plunging
the
arm
up
to
the
elbow
in
boiling
water
ordeal
a
severe
test
or
judgment
the
person
who
underwent
the
ordeal
appealed
to
god
to
prove
his
innocence
by
protecting
him
from
harm
rude
as
both
these
methods
were
they
were
better
than
the
old
tribal
method
which
permitted
every
man
or
every
man
family
to
be
the
avenger
of
his
wrongs
the
common
law
the
laws
by
which
these
cases
were
tried
were
almost
always
ancient
customs
few
of
which
had
been
reduced
to
writing
they
formed
that
body
of
common
law
which
is
the
foundation
of
the
modern
system
of
justice
both
in
england
and
america
so
called
in
distinction
from
the
statute
laws
made
by
parliament
penalties
the
penalties
inflicted
by
these
courts
consisted
chiefly
of
fines
each
man
life
had
a
certain
wergild
or
money
value
the
fine
for
the
murder
of
a
man
of
very
high
rank
was
shillings
that
of
a
simple
freeman
was
only
one
twelfth
as
much
a
slave
could
neither
testify
in
court
nor
be
punished
by
the
court
for
the
man
in
that
day
who
held
no
land
had
no
rights
if
a
slave
was
convicted
of
crime
his
master
paid
the
fine
and
then
flogged
him
until
he
had
got
his
money
worth
out
of
him
treason
was
punished
with
death
and
common
scolds
were
ducked
in
a
pond
until
they
were
glad
to
hold
their
tongues
these
methods
of
administering
justice
were
crude
but
they
had
the
great
merit
of
being
effective
they
aimed
to
do
two
very
necessary
things
first
to
protect
the
community
against
dangerous
criminals
secondly
to
teach
those
criminals
that
the
way
of
the
transgressor
is
hard
ii
religion
the
ancient
saxon
faith
before
their
conversion
to
christianity
the
saxons
worshiped
woden
and
thor
names
preserved
in
wednesday
woden
day
and
thursday
thor
day
the
first
appears
to
have
been
considered
to
be
the
creator
and
ruler
of
heaven
and
earth
the
second
was
his
son
the
god
of
thunder
slayer
of
evil
spirits
and
friend
of
man
the
essential
element
of
their
religion
was
the
deification
of
strength
courage
and
fortitude
it
was
a
faith
well
suited
to
a
warlike
people
it
taught
that
there
was
a
heaven
for
the
brave
and
a
hell
for
cowards
what
christianity
did
christianity
on
the
contrary
laid
emphasis
on
the
virtues
of
and
sympathy
it
took
the
side
of
the
weak
and
the
helpless
the
church
itself
held
slaves
yet
it
labored
for
emancipation
it
built
monasteries
and
encouraged
industry
and
education
the
church
edifice
was
a
kind
of
open
bible
very
few
who
entered
the
sacred
building
then
could
have
spelled
out
a
single
word
of
either
the
old
or
new
testament
even
if
they
had
then
been
translated
from
latin
into
english
but
all
from
the
poorest
peasant
or
the
meanest
slave
up
to
the
greatest
noble
could
read
the
meaning
of
the
scripture
histories
painted
in
brilliant
colors
on
wall
and
window
the
church
furthermore
was
a
peculiarly
sacred
place
it
was
powerful
to
shield
those
who
were
in
danger
if
a
criminal
or
a
person
fleeing
from
vengeance
took
refuge
in
it
he
could
not
be
seized
until
forty
days
had
expired
during
which
time
he
had
the
privilege
of
leaving
the
kingdom
and
going
into
exile
this
right
of
sanctuary
was
often
a
needful
protection
in
an
age
of
violence
in
time
however
the
system
became
an
intolerable
abuse
since
it
enabled
robbers
and
desperadoes
of
all
kinds
to
defy
the
law
the
right
was
modified
at
different
times
but
was
not
wholly
abolished
until
in
the
reign
of
james
iii
military
affairs
the
army
the
army
consisted
of
a
national
militia
or
fyrd
and
a
feudal
militia
from
the
earliest
times
all
freemen
were
obliged
to
fight
in
the
defense
of
the
country
under
the
feudal
system
every
large
landholder
had
to
furnish
the
king
a
stipulated
number
of
men
fully
equipped
with
armor
and
weapons
as
this
method
was
found
more
effective
than
the
first
it
gradually
superseded
it
the
saxons
always
fought
on
foot
they
wore
helmets
and
rude
flexible
armor
formed
of
iron
rings
or
of
stout
leather
covered
with
small
plates
of
iron
and
other
substances
they
carried
shields
their
chief
weapons
were
the
spear
javelin
and
sword
the
wars
of
this
period
were
those
of
the
different
tribes
seeking
to
get
the
advantage
over
each
other
or
of
the
english
with
the
danes
the
navy
until
alfred
reign
the
english
had
no
navy
from
that
period
they
maintained
a
fleet
of
small
warships
to
protect
the
coast
from
invasion
most
of
these
vessels
appear
to
have
been
furnished
by
certain
ports
on
the
south
coast

literature

and
art
runes
the
language
of
the
saxons
was
of
origin
many
of
the
words
resemble
the
german
of
the
present
day
when
written
the
characters
were
called
runes
mysteries
or
secrets
the
chief
use
of
these
runes
was
to
mark
a
sword
hilt
or
some
article
of
value
or
to
form
a
charm
against
evil
and
witchcraft
it
is
supposed
that
one
of
the
earliest
runic
inscriptions
is
the
following
which
dates
from
about
it
is
cut
on
a
drinking
horn

from
which
our
modern
english
alphabet
is
derived
took
the
place
of
the
runic
characters
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
greek
and
english
literature
began
with
the
coming
of
the
monks
the
first
books
one
of
the
first
english
books
of
great
value
was
the
chronicle
a
history
covering
a
period
beginning
and
ending
in
the
work
was
probably
written
by
the
monks
in
canterbury
peterborough
and
other
monasteries
it
may
be
considered
as
an
annual
register
of
iportant
events
thorpe
says
of
it
no
other
nation
can
produce
any
history
written
in
its
own
vernacular
at
all
approaching
the
chronicle
either
in
antiquity
truthfulness
or
extent
the
historical
books
of
the
bible
alone
excepted
though
written
in
prose
it
countains
various
fragments
of
poetry
of
which
the
following
rendered
into
modern
english
on
the
death
of
edward
the
confessor
may
be
quoted
as
an
example
then
suddenly
came
on
harold
self

the
bitter
a
noble
earl

that
dear
prince

in
all
times
angels

his

the
wise
king

the

the
farming
of

the
town
the
first
saxon
settlements
were
quite
generally
on
the
line
of
the
old
roman
roads
they
were
surrounded
by
a
rampart
of
earth
set
with
a
thick
hedge
or
with
rows
of
sharp
stakes
outside
this
was
a
deep
ditch
these
places
were
called
towns
from
tun
meaning
a
fence
or
hedge
the
chief
fortified
towns
were
called
burghs
or
boroughs
later
on
this
class
of
towns
generally
had
a
corporate
form
of
government
and
eventually
they
sent
representatives

a

still
so
called

the
hall
the
buildings
in
these
towns
were
of
wood
those
of
the
lords
or
chief
men
were
called
halls
from
the
fact
that
they
consisted
mainly
of
a
hall
or
large
room
used
as
a
sitting
eating
and
often
as
a
sleeping
room
a
bundle
of
straw
or
some
skins
thrown
on
the
floor
serving
for
beds
there
were
no
chimneys
but
a
hole
in
the
roof
let
out
the
smoke
if
the
owner
was

would

on
a
raised
platform
at
one
end
of
the
hall
while
his
followers
ate
at
a
lower
table
the
saxons
were
hard
drinkers
as
well
as
hard
fighters
after
the
meal
while
horns
of
ale
and
mead
were
circulating
the
minstrels
taking
their
harps
would
sing
songs
of
battle
and
ballads
of
wild

outside
the
hall
were
the
bowers
or
chambers
for
the
master
and
his
family
and
perhaps
an
upper
chamber
for
a
guest
called
later
by
the
normans
a
sollar
or
sunny
room

the

early
english
lived
a
life
of

outspoken
and
fearless
theirs
was
not
the
nimble
brain
for
that

another
people
the
normans
though
a
people
originally
of
the

guilds
the
inhabitants
of
the
towns
and
cities
had
various
associations
called
guilds
from
gild
a
payment
or
contribution
the
object
of
these
was
mutual
assistance
the
most
important
were
the
frith
guilds
or
peace
guilds
and
the
merchant
guilds
the
former
constituted
a
voluntary
police
force
to
preserve
order
and
bring
thieves
to
punishment
each
member
contributed
a
small
sum
to
form
a
common
fund
which
was
useed
to
make
good
any
losses
incurred
by
robbery
or
fire
the
association
held
itself
responsible
for
the
good
behavior
of
its
members
and
kept
a
sharp
eye
on
strangers
and
stragglers
who
had
to
give
an
account
of
themselves
or
leave
the
country
the
merchant
guilds
were
organized
apparantly
at
a
late
period
to
protect
and
extend
trade
after
the
norman
conquest
they
came
to
be
very
wealthy
and
influential
in
addition
to
the
above
there
were
social
and
religious
guilds

the
oppresive
rule
of
the
regents
soon
caused
a
rebellion
and
in
december
william
returned
to
england
to
put
it
down
he
found
the
task
a
hard
one
the
king
of
denmark
made
it
all
the
harder
by
sending
over
a
powerful
fleet
to
held
the
english
william
bribed
the
danish
commanders
and
they
sailed
away
without
striking
a
blow
then
little
by
little
he
brought
the
land
to
obedience
by
forced
marches
in
midwinter
by
roads
cast
up
through
bogs
and
by
sudden
night
attacks
william
accomplished
the
end
he
sought
but
news
came
of
a
fresh
revolt
in
the
north
accompanied
by
another
invasion
of
foreign
barbarians
then
william
roused
by
terrible
anger
swore
by
the
splendor
of
god
that
he
would
lay
waste
the
land
he
made
good
his
oath
for
a
hundred
miles
beyond
the
river
humber
in
yorkshire
he
ravaged
the
country
burning
villages
destroying
houses
crops
and
cattle
and
reduced
the
wretched
people
to
such
destitution
that
many
sold
themselves
for
slaves
to
escape
starvation
having
finished
his
work
in
the
north
he
turned
toward
the
ancient
roman
city
of
chester
in
the
west
and
captured
it

every

of

was
now
in
william
power

an
island
in

swamps
of
ely
in
the
east
of

there
the
englishman
hereward
with
his
resolute
little
band
of
fellow
countrymen
continued
to
defy
the
power
of
the
conqueror
see

had
there
been
three
more
men
like
him
in
the
island
said
one
of
william
own
soldiers
the
normans
would
never
have
entered
it
but
as
there
were
not
three
more
the
conquest
was
at
length
completed
necessity
of
william
severity
the
work
of
death
had
been
fearful
but
it
was
better
that
england
should
suffer
from
these
pitiless
measures
than
that
it
should
sink
into
anarchy
or
into
subjection
to
hordes
of
northmen
for
those
fierce
barbarians
destroyed
not
because
they
desired
to
build
something
better
but
because
they
hated
civilization
and
all
its
works
whatever
william
faults
may
have
been
his
great
object
was
to
build
up
a
government
better
than
any
england
had
yet
seen
hence
his
severity
hence
his
castles
and
forts
by
which
he
made
sure
of
retaining
his
hold
upon
whatever
he
had
gained
william
builds
the
tower
of
london
we
have
seen
that
william
gave
london
a
charter
but
overlooking
the
place
in
which
the
charter
was
kept
he
built
the
tower
of
london
to
hold
the
turbulent
city
in
wholesome
restraint
that
tower
as
fortress
palace
and
prison
stands
as
the
dark
background
of
most
events
in
english
history
it
was
the
forerunner
of
a
multitude
of
norman
castles
they
rose
on
the
banks
of
every
river
and
on
the
summit
of
every
rocky
height
from
the
west
hill
of
hastings
to
the
peak
of
derbyshire
and
from
the
banks
of
the
thames
to
those
of
the
tweed
side
by
side
with
these
strongholds
there
also
rose
a
great
number
of
monasteries
churches
and
cathedrals

with
the
progress
of

the
confiscation
of
land
went
on
william
had
seized
the
lands
belonging
to
harold
and
those
of
the
chief
men
associated
with
him
and
had
given
them
to
his
own
followers
in
england
in
this
way
all
the
greatest
estates
and
the
most
important
offices
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
normans
the
king
made
these
royal
grants
on
the
express
condition
that
those
who
received
them
should
furnish
him
a
certain
number
of
armed
men
whenever
he
should
demand
them
two
great
classes
of
society
now
existed
in
england
first
the
leading
norman
conquerors
who
as
chief
tenants
or
landholders
under
the
crown
and
as
peers
of
the
realm
had
the
title
of
barons
they
numbered
about
fifteen
hundred
and
as
we
have
just
seen
they
were
all
pledged
to
draw
their
swordss
in
behalf
of
the
king
secondly
the
english
who
had
been
reduced
to
a
subordinate
state
most
of
these
now
held
their
land
as
grants
from
the
norman
barons
on
condition
of
some
kind
of
service
a
majority
of
these
men
were
no
longer
entirely
free
while
some
were
actual
slaves
the
greater
part
of
this
servile
class
were
villeins
or
farm
laborers
they
were
bound
to
the
soil
and
could
be
sold
with
it
but
not
like
the
slaves
separately
from
it
they
could
be
compelled
to
perform
any
menial
labor
but
usually
held
their
plots
of
land
and
humble
cottages
on
condition
of
plowing
a
certain
number
of
acres
or
doing
a
certain
number
of
work
in
each
year
in
time
the
villeins
generally
obtained
the
privilege
of
paying
a
fixed
money
rent
in
place
of
labor
and
their
condition
gradually
improved
how
william
distributed
his
gifts
yet
it
is
noticeable
that
when
william
granted
estates
to
his
norman
followers
he
was
careful
not
to
give
any
baron
too
much
land
in
any
one
county
or
shire
his
experience
in
normandy
had
taught
him
that
it
was
better
to
divide
than
to
concentrate
the
power
of
the
great
nobles
who
were
often
only
too
ready
to
plot
to
get
the
crown
for
themselves
thus
william
developed
and
extended
the
feudal
system
of
land
tenure
already
in
existence
in
outline
among
the
saxons
until
it
covered
every
part
of
the
realm
he
however
kept
this
system
strictly
subordinate
to
himself
and
we
shall
see
that
before
the
close
of
his
reign
he
held
a
great
meeting
by
which
he
got
absolute
control
over
it
see
too
the
constitutional
summary
in
the
appendix
v
the
three
counties
palatine
the
only
exceptions
which
william
made
in
these
carefully
restricted
grants
were
the
three
counties
palatine
which
he
created
they
bordered
on
wales
in
the
west
scotland
in
the
north
and
the
english

in

southeast
to

earls
of
these
counties
of
chester
durham
and
kent
which
were
especially
liable
to
attack
from
wales
scotland
or
france
william
thought
it
expedient
to
give
almost
royal
power
which
descended
in
their
families

the

of

nobles
caused

to
put

to
these
crimes
william
enacted

it
compelled
the
people
of
the
district
where
a
murder
was
perpetrated
to
pay
a
heavy
fine
for
every
norman
so
slain
for

ascended

he
was
the
ablest

most
ambitious
and
in
some
respects
he
most
farsighted
man
who
had

gregory
scheme

europe
was
at
that
time
in
a
condition
little
better
than
anarchy
a
perpetual
quarrel
was
going
on
between
the
feudal
barons
the
church
too
as
we
have
seen
had
temporarily
lost
much
of
its
power
for
good
pope
gregory
conceived
a
scheme
of
reform
which
he
intended
should
be
both
wide
and
deep
like
dunstan
he
determined
to
correct
the
abuses
which
had
crept
into
the
monasteries
he
resolved
to
have
a
priesthood
who
should
devote
themselves
body
and
soul
to
the
interests
of
the
church
he
resolved
to
bring
all
society
into
submission
to
that
priesthood
finally
he
resolved
to
make
the
priesthood
itself
acknowledge
him
as
its
sole
master
his
purpose
in
this
gigantic
scheme
was
a
noble
one
it
was
to
establish
the
unity
and
peace
of
europe
the
pope
and
the
conqueror
pope
gregory
looked
to
william
for
help
in
this
matter
the
conqueror
who
was
a
zealous
catholic
was
ready
to
give
that
help
but
with
limitations
he
pledged
himself
to
aid
in
reforming
the
english
church
which
had
enjoyed
an
insular
and
barbaric
independence
he
undertook
to
remove
inefficient
men
from
its
high
places
the
king
also
agreed
to
do
something
that
had
never
been
done
before
in
england
namely
to
establish
separate
courts
for
the
trial
of
church
cases
finally
he
agreed
to
pay
the
customary
yearly
tax
to
rome
called
peter
pence
but
pope
gregory
was
not
satisfied
he
demanded
that
the
conqueror
should
do
him
homage
for
his
crown
and
should
swear
to
become
his
man
this
william
respectfully
but
decidedly
refused
to
do
saying
that
as
no
king
of
the
english
before
him
had
ever
become
the
pope
man
so
neither
would
he
in
taking
this
action
the
king
declared
himself
to
be
an
obedient
and
affectionate
son
of
the
holy
catholic
church
but
at
the
same
time
he
laid
down
these
three
rules
to
show
that
he
would
not
tolerate
any
interference
with
his
power
as
an
independent
english
sovereign
that
no
pope
should
be
acknowledged
in
england
or
letters
from
the
pope
received
there
without
his
sanction
that
no
national
synod
or
meeting
of
churchmen
should
enact
any
decrees
binding
the
english
church
without
his
confirmation
that
no
baron
or
officer
of
his
should
be
expelled
from
the
church
without
his
permission

it
is
noticeable
that
pope
gregory
never
seems
to
have
censured
william
for
the
position
he
took
perhaps
because
one
brave
man
always
understands
and
respects
another
yet
a
little
later
than
this

but
just
ruler
the

the
new

considering
his
love
of
power
and
strength
of
will
the
reign
of
william
was
conspicuous
for
its
justice
he
was
harsh
but
generally
fair
he
protected
the
jewish
traders
who
came
over
to
england
in
his
reign
for
he
saw
that
their
commercial
enterprise
and
their
financial
skill
would
be
of
immense
value
in
developing
the
country
then
too
if
the
royal
treasury
should
happen
to
run
dry
he
thought
it
might
be
convenient
to
coax
or
compel
the
jews
to
lend
him
a
round
sum
on
the
other
had
the
king
seized
a
tract
of
over
sixty
thousand
acres
in
hampshire
for
a
hunting
ground
which
he
named
the
new
forest
it
was
said
that
william
destroyed
many
churches
and
estates
in
order
to
form
this
forest
but
these
accounts
appear
to
have
been
greatly
exaggerated
the
real
grievance
was
not
so
much
the
appropriation
of
the
land
which
was
sterile
and
of
little
value
but
it
was
the
enactment
of
the
savage
forest
laws
these
ordinances
made
he
life
of
a
stag
of
more
value
than
that
of
a
man
and
decreed
that
anyone
found
hunting

should
have

the
english
people
said
this
name
was
given
to
it
because
like
the
day
of

it
spared
no
one
it
recorded

had
then
only
the
census
and
assessment
proved
of
the
highest
importance
to
william
and
his
successors
the
people
indeed
said
bitterly
that
the
king
kept
to
book
constantly

him
in
order
that
he
might
be
able
to
see
at
any
time
of
how
much
more
wool
the
english
flock
would
bear
fleecing
the
object
of
the
work
however
was
not
to
extort
money
but
to
present
a
full

exact
report

the
financial
and
military
resources
of
the

the

it
was
fortunate
for
the
country
that
william
came
for
out
of
chaos
or
affairs
fast
drifting
to
chaos
his
strong
hand
clear
brain
and
resolute
purpose
brought

safety
and

we
may
say
therefore
with
an
eminent

that
england
owes
her
liberties
to
her
having
been
conquered

william
death
in
less
than
a
year
from
that
time
william
went
to
normandy
to
quell
an
invasion
led
by
his
eldest
son
robert
as
he
rode
down
a
steep
street
in
mantes
his
horse
stumbled
and
he
received
a
fatal
injury
he
was
carried
to
the
priory
of
gervase
just
outside
the
city
of
rouen
early
in
the
morning
he
was
awakened
by
the
great
cathedral
bell
it
is
an
hour
of
praise
his
attendant
said
to
him
when
the
priests
give
thanks
for
the
new
day
william
lifted
up
his
hands
in
prayer
and
expired
his
burial
his
remains
were
taken
for
interment
to
stephen
church
which
he
had
built
in
the
city
of
caen
normandy
as
they
were
preparing
to
let
down
the
body
into
the
grave
a
man
suddenly
stepped
forward
and
forbade
the
burial
william
he
said
had
taken
the
land
on
which
the
church
stood
from
his
father
by
violence
he
demanded
payment
the
corpse
was
left
on
the
bier
and
inquiry
instituted
and
not
until
the
debt
was
discharged
was
the
body
lowered
to
its
last
resting
place
thus
says
the
old
chronicle
he
who
had
been
a
powerful
king
and
the
lord
of
so
many
territories
possessed
not
then
of
all
his
lands
more
than
seven
feet
of
earth
and
not
even
that
unttil
the
cash
was
paid
for
it
but
william
bones
were
not
to
rest
when
finally
laid
in
the
grave
for
less
than
five
centuries
later
the
french
protestants
dug
them
up
and
scattered
them
summary
the
results
of
the
norman
conquest
may
be
thus
summed
up
the
conquest
was
not
the
subjugation
of
the
english
by
a
different
race
but
rather
a
victory
won
for
their
advantage
by
a
branch
of
their
own
race
it
found
england
a
divided
country
it
made
it
a
united
kingdom
it
also
united
england
and
normandy
and
brought
the
new
english
kingdom
into
closer
contact
with
the
higher
civilization
of
the
continent
this
introduced
fresh
intellectual
stimulus
and
gave
to
the
a
more
progressive
spirit
it
modified
the
english
language
by
the
influence
of
the
element
thus
giving
it
greater
flexibility
refinement
and
elegance
of
expression
it
substituted
for
the
fragile
and
decaying
structures
of
wood
generally
built
by
the
saxons
norman
castles
abbeys
and
cathedrals
of
stone
it
hastened
influences
which
were
already
at
work
for
the
consolidation
of
the
nation
it
developed
and
completed
the
feudal
form
of
land
tenure
but
it
made
that
tenure
strictly
subordinate
to
the
crown
and
so
freed
it
in
great
measure
from
the
evils
of
continental
feudalism
it
reorganized
the
english
church
and
defined
the
relation
of
the
crown
to
that
church
and
to
the
pope
it
abolished
the
four
great
earldoms
which
had
been
a
constant
source
of
weakness
danger
and
division
it
put
an
end
to
the
danish
invasions
it
brought
the
whole
of
england
under
a
strong
monarchical
government
to
which
not
only
all
the
great
nobles
but
also
their
vassals
or
tenants
were
compelled
to
swear
allegiance
it
made
no
radical
changes
in
the
english
laws
but
enforced
impartial
obedience
to
them
among
all
classes
it
has
already
been
shown
that
norman
saxon
and
dane
were
originally
branches
of
the
teutonic
or
german
race
professor

is
the
highest
authority

this
subject

especially
his

holds
the
view
that
the
coming
of
william
was
on

whole
the
greatest
advantage
to

the

on

thirteen

of

lanfranc
archbishop
of
canterbury
died
three
years
after
william
accession
through
flambard
advice
the
king
left
the
archbishopric
vacant
and
appropriated
its
revenues
to
himself
he
practiced
the
same
course
with

every
office
of

makes

while
this
process
of
systematized
robbery
was
going
on
the
king
suddenly
fell
ill
in
his
alarm
lest
death
was
at
hand
he
determined
to
make
reparation
to
the
defrauded
and
insulted
priesthood
he
invited
anselm
the
abbot
of
a
famous
monastery
in
normandy
to
accept
the
archbishopric
anselm
who
was
old
and
feeble
declined
saying
that
he
and
the
king
could
not
work
together
it
would
be
said
he
like
yoking
a
sheep
and
a

but
the
king
would
take
no
refusal
calling
anselm
to
his
bedside
he
forced
the
staff
of
office
into
his
hands
anselm
became
the
champion
of
the
freedom
of
the
church
but
when
the
king
recovered
he
resumed
his
old
practices
and
treated
the
archbishop
with
such
insult
that
he
left
the
country
for
a
time
william
merit
his
death
william
ii
one
merit
was
that
he
kept
england
from
being
devoured
piecemeal
by
the
norman
barons
who
regarded
her
as
a
pack
of
hounds
in
full
chase
regard
the
hare
that
is
on
the
point
of
falling
into
their
rapacious
jaws
like
his
father
he
insisted
on
keeping
the
english
church
independent
of
the
power
of
rome
in
both
cases
his
motives
were
purely
selfish
but
the
result
to
the
country
was
good
his
power
came
suddenly
to
an
end
he
had
gone
in
the
morning
to
hunt
in
the
new
forest
with
his
brother
henry
he
was
found
lying
dead
among
the
bushes
pierced
by
an
arrow
shot
by
an
unknown
hand
william
character
speaks
in
his
deeds
it
was
hard
cold
despotic
yet
in
judging
it
we
should
consider
the
woulds
of
that
quaint
old
writer
thomas
fuller
when
he
says
no
pen
hath
originally
written
the
life
of
this
king
but
what
was
made
with
a
monkish
penknife
and
no
wonder
if
his
picture
seems
bad
which
was
thus
drawn
by
his
enemy
summary
notwithstanding
william
oppression
of
both
church
and
people
his
reign
checked
the
revolt
of
the
baronage
and
prevented
the
kingdom
from
falling
into
anarchy
like
that
existing
in
france
henry
i
henry
charter
of
liberties
henry
third
son
of
william
the
conqueror
was
the
first
of
the
norman
kings
who
was
born
and
educated
in
england
foreseeing
a
renewal
of
the
contest
with
the
barons
he
issued
a
charter
of
liberties
on
his
accession
by
which
he
bound
himself
to
reform
the
abuses
which
had
been
practiced
by
his
brother
william
rufus
the
charter
guaranteed
the
rights
of
the
church
which
william
rufus
had
constantly
violated
the
rights
of
the
nobles
and
landholders
against
extortionate
demands
by
the
crown
the
right
of
all
classes
to
protection
of
the
old
english
customs
or
laws
the
king
sent
a
hundred
copies
of
this
important
document
to
the
leading
abbots
and
bishops
for
preservation
in
their
respective
monasteries
and
cathedrals
as
this
charter
was
the
earliest
written
and
formal
guarantee
of
good
government
ever
given
by
the
crown
to
the
nation
it
marks
an
important
epoch
in
english
history
it
may
be
compared
to
the
statements
of
principles
and
pledges
issued
by
our
modern
political
parties
it
was
a
virtual
admission
that
the
time
had
come
when
even
a
norman
sovereign
could
not
dispense
with
the
support
of
the
country
it
was
therefore
an
admission
of
the
truth
that
while
a
people
can
exist
without
a
king
no
king
can
exist
without
a
people
furthermore
this
charter
established
a
precedent
for
those
which
were
to
follow
and
which
reached
a
final
development
in
the
great
charter
wrested
from
the
unwilling
hand
of
king
john
somewhat
more
than
a
century
later
henry
further
strengthened
his
position
with
his
english
subjects
by
his
marriage
with
maud
nice
of
the
saxon
edgar
a
direct
descendant
of
king
alfred
the
appointment
of
bishops
settled
king
henry
also
recalled
anselm
and
reinstated
him
in
his
office
but
the
peace
was
of
short
duration
the
archbishop
insisted
as
did
the
pope
that
the
power
of
appointment
of
bishops
should
be
vested
wholly
in
rome
the
king
was
equally
determined
that
such
appointments
should
spring
from
himself
like
william
the
conqueror
he
declared
no
one
shall
remain
in
my
land
who
will
not
do
me
homage
the
quarrel
was
eventually
settled
by
compromise
the
pope
was
to
invest
the
bishop
with
ring
and
crosier
or
pastoral
staff
of
office
as
emblems
of
the
spiritual
power
the
king
on
the
other
hand
was
to
grant
the
lands
from
which
he
bishop
drew
his
revenues
and
in
return
was
to
receive
his
homage
or
oath
of
allegiance
this
acknowledgement
of
royal
authority
by
the
church
was
of
great
importance
since
it
gave
the
king
power
as
feudal
lord
to
demand
from
each
bishop
his
quota
of
fully
equipped
knights
or
cavalry
soldiers
this
armed
force
would

henry
had
still
more
pressing
matters
to
attend
to
his
elder
brother
robert
had
invaded
england
and
demanded
the
crown
the
greater
part
of
the
norman
nobles
supported
this
claim
but
the
english
people
held
to
henry
finally
in
consideration
of
a
heavy
money
payment
robert
agreed
to
return
to
normandy
and
leave
his
brother
in
full
possession
of
the
realm
on
his
departure
henry
resolved
to
drive
out
the
prominent
nobles
who
had
aided
robert
of
these
the
earl
of
shrewsbury
called
robert
the
devil
was
the
leader
with
the
aid
of
the
english
who
hated
him
for
his
cruelty
the
earl
was
at
last
compelled
to
leave
the
country
he
fled
to
normandy
and
in
violation
of
a
previous
agreement
was
received
by
henry
brother
robert
upon
that
henry
declared
war
and
crossing
the
channel
fought
the
battle
of
tinchebrai
by
which
he
conquered
and
held
normandy
as
completely
as
william
duke
of
normandy
had
conquered
england
forty
years
before
the
king
carried
his
brother
captive
to
wales
and
kept
him
in

the

themselves
for

henry
daughter
matilda
for
he
left
no
lawful
son
and
his
nephew
stephen
in
france
the
custom
of
centuries
had
determined
that
the
crown
should
never
descend
to
a
female
it
was
an
age
when
the
sovereign
was
expected
to
lead
his
army
in
person
and
it
certainly
was
not
expedient
that
a
woman
should
hold
a
position
one
of
whose
chief
duties
she
could
not
discharge
this
french
custom
had
of
course
no
force
in
england
but
the
norman
nobles
must
have
recognized
its
reasonableness
or
if
not
the
people
did
before
henry
death
the
baronage
had
generally
sworn
to
support
matilda

matilda

maud
from

to

henry

later
she
married
geoffrey

with

help
of

and
the
church
declared
himself
elected
king
by
the
assent
of
the
clergy
and
the
people
many
of
the
barons
now
gave
stephen
their
support
four
years
after
stephen
accession
matilda
landed
in
england
and
claimed
the
crown
the
east
of
england
stood
by
stephen
the
west
by
matilda
for
the
sake
of
promoting
discord
and
through
discord
their
own
private
ends
part
of
the
barons
gave
their
support
to
matilda

the
rest
refused

their
estates
under

fatal
defect
in

was
the
absence

ability

issued
two
charters

in

by

the
battle
of
the

was
fought
the
leaders
of
the

were
both
churchmen
who
showed
that
they
could
fight
as
vigorously
as
they
could

the
standard
consisted
of
four
consecrated
banners
surmounted
by

after
a

contest
the
scots
were
driven
from
the
field
it
is
said
that
this
was
the
first
battle
in
which
the
english
peasants
used
the
long
bow
they
had
taken
the
hist
perhaps
from
the
norman
archers
at
the
battle
of
hastings
many
years
later

skill
in
foreign
war
made
that
weapon
as
famous
as
it
was
effective
civil
war
for
fifteen
years
following
the
country
was
torn
by
civil
war
while
it
raged
fortified
castles
which
under
william
the
conqueror
had
been
built
and
occupied
by
the
king
only
or
by
those
whom
he
could
trust
now
arose
on
every
side
these
strongholds
became
as
the
chronicle
declares
very
nests
of
devils
and
dens
of
thieves
more
than
a
thousand
of
these
castles
it
is
said
were
built
the
armed

who
inhavited

tribute
on
the
whole
country
around
not
satisfied
with
that
these
miscreants
seized
those
who
were
suspected
of
having
property
and
in
the
words
of
the
chronicle
tortured
them
with
pains
unspeakable
for
some
they
hung
up
by
the
feet
and
smoked
with
foul
smoke
others
they
crushed
in
a
narrow
chest
with
sharp
stones
about
the
heads
of
others
they
bound
knotted
cords
until
they
went
into
the
brain
thousands
died
of
hunger
the
towns
were
burned
and
the
soil
left
untilled
by
such
deeds
the
land
was
ruined
and
men
said
openly
that
christ
and
his
saints
were
asleep
the
sleep
however
was
not
always
to
last
for
in
the
next
reign
justice
in
the
person
of
henry
ii
effectually
vindicated
her
power
the
strife
for
the
crown
continued
till
the
last
year
of
reign
then
the
church
came
to
the
rescue
and
through
its
powerful
influence
the
treaty
of
wallingford
in
berkshire
was
made
by
that
treaty
it
was
agreed
that
matilda
son
henry
should
succeed
stephen
summary
stephen
was
the
last
of
the
norman
kings
their
reign
had
covered
nearly
a
century
the
period
began
in
conquest
and
usurpation
it
ended
in
gloom
we
are
not
however
to
judge
it
by
stephen
reign
alone
but
as
a
whole
this
considered
it
shows
at
least
one
point
of
advance
over
the
preceding
period
the
triumph
of
the
moral
power
of
the
church
over
feudal
discord
but
stephen
reign
was
not
all
loss
in
other
respects
for
out
of
the
war
wickedness
and
waste
of
his
misgovernment
came
a
universal
desire
for
peace
through
law
thus
indirectly
this
weak
king
inefficiency
prepared
the

we
have
seen
that
the
saxons

early
english
rulers
in
the
case
of
egbert
and
his
successors
styled
themselves
kings
of
the
west
saxons
or
of
some
other
division
of
that
race
and
that
finally
they
assumed
the
broader
title
of
kings
of
the
english
or
leaders
of
the
entire
race
or
people
the
norman
sovereigns
made
no
immediate
change
in
this
title
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
william
toward
the
close
of
his
reign
claimed
the
whole
of
the
country
as
his
own
by
right
of
conquest
for
this
reason
he
and
his
norman
successors
might
properly
have
called
themselves
kings
of
england
that
is
supreme
owners
of
the
soil
and
rulers
over
it
but
this
title
of
territorial
sovereignty
was
not
formally
assumed
until
about
fifty
years
later
in
john
reign
the
great
council
associated
with
the
king
in
government
was
the
great
or
central
council
made
up
of
first
the
earls
and
barons
and
secondly
of
the
archbishops
bishops
and
abbots
that
is
of
all
the
great
landholders
holding
directly
from
the
crown
the
great
council
usually
met
three
times
a
year
at
christmas
easter
and
whitsuntide
all
laws
were
held
to
be
made
by
the
king
acting
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
this
council
which
in
the
next
century
first
came
to
be
known
as
parliament
but
practically
the
king
alone
often
enacted
such
laws
as
he
saw
fit
when
a
new
sovereign
came
to
the
throne
it
was
with
the
consent
or
by
the
election
of
the
great
council
but
their
choice
was
generally
limited
to
some
one
of
the
late
king
sons
and
unless
therer
was
good
reason
for
making
a
different
selection
the
oldest
was
chosen
finally
the
right
of
imposing
taxes
rested
theoretically
at
least
in
the
king
and
council
but
in
fact
the
king
himself
frequently
levied
them
this
action
of
the
king
was
a
cause
of
constant
irritation
and
of
frequent
insurrection
the
private
or
king
council
there
was
also
a
second
and
permanent
council
called
the
council
the
three
leading
officers
of
this
were
first
the
chief
justice
who
superintended
the
execution
of
the
laws
represented
the
king
and
ruled
for
him
during
his
absence
from
the
country
secondly
the
lord
chancellor
so
called
from
cancelli
the
screen
behind
which
he
sat
with
his
clerks
who
acted
as
the
king
adviser
and
confidential
secretary
and
as
keeper
of
the
great
seal
with
which
he
stamped
all
important
papers
thirdly
the
lord
high
treasurer
who
took
charge
of
the
king
revenue
received
all
moneys
due
the
crown
and
kept
the
king
treasure
in
the
vaults
at
winchester
or
westminster
the
lord
chancellor
was
also
the
keeper
of
the
conscience
because
intrusted
with
the
duty
of
redressing
those
grievances
of
the
king
subjects
which
required
royal
interference
the
court
of
chancery
mentioned
on
page
note
grew
out
of
this
office
tallies
all
accounts
were
kept
by
the
treasurer
on
tallies
or
small
sticks
notched
on
the
opposite
sides
to
represent
different
sums
these
were
split
lengthwise
one
was
given
as
a
receipt
to
the
sheriff
or
other
person
paying
in
money
to
the
treasury
while
the
duplicate
of
this
tally
was
held
by
the
treasurer
this
primitive
method
of
keeping
royal
accounts
remained
legally
in
force
until
in
the
reign
of
george
iii
the
curia
regis
or
the
king
court
of
justice
the
chief
justice
and
chancellor
were
generally
chosen
by
the
king
from
among
the
clergy
first
because
the
clergy
were
men
of
education
while
the
barons
were
not
and
next
because
it
was
not
expedient
to
intrust
too
much
power
to
the
barons
these
officials
with
the
other
members
of
the
private
council
constituted
the
high
court
of
justice
curia
regis
this
name
was
given
at
different
times
first
to
the
great
or
national
council
secondly
to
the
king
private
council
and
lastly
to
the
high
court
of
justice
consisting
of
members
of
the
private
council
it
followed
the
king
as
he
moved
from
place
to
place
to
hear
and
decide
cases
carried
up
by
appeal
from
the
county
courts
together
with
other
questions
of
importance
in
local
government
the
country
remained
under
the
normans
essentially
the
same
as
it
had
been
before
the
conquest
the
king
continued
to
be
represented
in
each
county
by
an
officer
called
the
sheriff
who
collected
the
taxes
and
enforced
the
laws
the
king
high
court
of
justice
curia
regis
was
divided
about
into
three
distinct
courts
the
exchequer
court
so
called
from
the
chequered
cloth
which
covered
the
table
of
the
court
and
which
was
probably
made
useful
in
counting
money
which
dealt
with
cases
of
finance
and
revenue
the
court
of
common
pleas
which
had
jurisdiction
in
civil
suits
between
subject
and
subject
the
court
of
king
bench
which
transacted
the
remaining
business
both
civil
and
criminal
and
had
special
jurisdiction
over
all
inferior
courts
and
civil
corporations
later
a
fourth
court
that
of
chancery
see
and
note
over
which
the
lord
chancellor
presided
was
established
as
a
court
of
appeal
and
equity
to
deal
with
cases
where
the
common
law
gave
no
relief
trial
by
battle
in
the
administration
of
justice
trial
by
battle
was
introduced
in
addition
to
the
ordeal
of
the
saxons
this
was
a
duel
in
which
each
of
the
contestants
appealed
to
heaven
to
give
him
the
victory
it
believed
that
the
right
would
vanquish
noblemen
fought
on
horseback
in
full
armor
with
sword
lance
and
common
people
fought
on
foot
with
clubs

was
in

of
judges

might
last
from

the
stars
appeared
priests
and
women
had
the
privilege
of
being
represented
by
champions
who
fought
for
them
trial
by

was
claimed
and
allowed
by
the
court
though
the
combat
did
not
come
off
as
late
as
in
the
reign
of
george
iii
this
custom
was
finally
abolished
in
trial
by

might
be
demanded
in
cases
of
chivalry
or
honor
in
criminal
actions
and
in
civil
suits
the
last
were
fought
not
by
the
disputants
themselves
but
by
champions
divisions
of
society
the
divisions
of
society
remained
after
the
conquest
very
nearly
as
before
but
the
saxon
orders
of
nobility
with
a
few
very
rare
exceptions
were
deprived
of
their
rank
and
their
estates
given
to
the
normans
it
is
important
to
notice
here
the
marked
difference
between
the
new
or
norman
nobility
and
that
of
france
in
england
a
man
was
considered
a
noble
because
under
william
and
his
successors
he
was
a
member
of
the
great
or
national
council
or
in
the
case
of
an
earl
because
he
represented
the
king
in
the
government
of
a
county
or
earldom
his
position
did
not
exempt
him
from
taxation
nor
did
his
rank
descend
to
more
than
one
of
his
children
in
france
on
the
contrary
the
aristocracy
were
noble
by
birth
not
office
they
were
generally
exempt
from
taxation
thus
throwing
the
whole
of
that
burden
on
the
people
and
their
rank
descended
to
all
their
children
during
the
norman
period
a
change
was
going
on
among
the
slaves
whose
condition
gradually
improved
on
the
other
hand
many
who
had
been
free
now
sank
into
that
state
of
villeinage
which
as
it
bound
them
to
the
soil
was
but
one
remove
from
actual
slavery
the
small
free
landholders
who
still
existed
were
mostly
in
the
old
danish
territory

of
watling

tenure

in
the

military

feudal

national

manors
and
manor
houses
all
land
was
held
directly
or
indirectly
from
the
king
on
condition
of
military
or
other
service
the
number
of
chief
tenants
who
derived
their
title
from
the
crown
including
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
was
probably
about
fifteen
hundred
these
constituted
the
norman
barons
the
undertenants
were
about
eight
thousand
and
consisted
chiefly
of
the
english
who
had
been
driven
out
from
their
estates
every
holder
of
land
was
obliged
to
furnish
the
king
a
fully
armed
and
mounted
soldier
to
serve
for
forty
days
during
the
year
for
each
piece
of
land
bringing
pounds
annually
or
about
in
modern
money
the
pound
of
that
day
probably
representing
twenty
times
that
sum
now
all
the
chief
tenants
were
also
bound
to
attend
the
king
great
or
national
council
three
times
a
year
at
christman
easter
and
whitsuntide
this
amount
does
not
appear
to
have
been
fully
settled
until
the
period
following
the
norman
kings
but
the
principle
was
recognized
by
william
feudal
dues
or
taxes
every
free
tenant
was
obliged
to
pay
a
sum
of
money
to
the
king
or
baron
from
whom
he
held
his
land
on
three
special
occasions
to
ransom
his
lord
from
captivity
in
case
he
was
made
a
prisoner
of
war
to
defray
the
expense
of
making
his
lord
eldest
son
a
knight
to
provide
a
suitable
marriage
portion
on
the
marriage
of
his
lord
eldest
daughter
in
addition
to
these
taxes
or
aids
as
they
were
called
there
were
other
demands
which
the
lord
might
make
such
as
a
year
profits
of
the
land
from
the
heir
on
his
coming
into
possession
of
his
father
estate
this
was
called
a
relief
the
income
from
the
lands
of
orphan
heirs
not
of
age
payment
for
privilege
of
disposing
of
land
the
clergy
being
a
corporate
and
hence
an
body
were
exempt
from
these
last
demands
not
satisfied
with
this
they
were
constantly
endeavoring
with
more
or
less
success
to
escape
all
feudal
obligations
on
the
ground
that
they
rendered
the
state
divine
service
in
in
the
reign
of
henry
i
it
was
settled
for
the
time
that
the
bishops
were
to
do
homage
to
the
king
furnish
military
service
for
the
lands
they
received
from
him
as
their
feudal
lord
in
case
of
an
orphan
heiress
not
of
age
the
feudal
lord
became
her
guardian
and
might
select
a
suitable
husband
for
her
should
the
heiress
reject
the
person
selected
she
forfeited
a
sum
of
money
equal
to
the
amount
the
lord
expected
to
receive
by
the
proposed
marriage
thus
we
find
one
woman
in
ipswich
giving
a
large
fee
for
the
privilege
of
not
being
married
except
to
her
own
good
liking
in
the
collection
of
these
aids
and
reliefs
great
extortion
was
often
practiced
both
by
the
king
and
the
barons
besides
the
feudal
troops
there
was
a
national
militia
consisting
of
peasants
and
others
not
provided
with
armor
who
fought
on
foot
with
bows
and
spears
these
could
also
be
called
on
as
during
the
saxon
period
in
some
cases
where
the
barons
were
in
revolt
against
the
king
for
instance
under
william
rufus
this
national
militia
proved
of
immense
service
to
the
crown
the
great
landholders
let
out
part
of
their
estates
to
tenants
on
similar
terms
to
those
on
which
they
held
their
own
and
in
this
way
the
entire
country
was
divided
up
the
lowest
class
of
tenants
were
the
common
agricultural
laborers
called
villeins
a
name
derived
from
the
latin
villa
meaning
a
country
house
or
farm
these
villeins
or
serfs
held
small
pieces
of
land
on
condition
of
performing
labor
for
it
they
were
bound
to
the
soil
and
could
be
sold
with
it
but
not
like
slaves
apart
from
it
they
were
not
wholly
destitute
of
legal
rights
under
william
i
and
his
successors
all
free
tenants
of
whatever
grade
were
bound
to
uphold
the
king
and
in
case
of
insurrection
or
civil
war
to
serve
under
him
in
this
most
important
respect
the
great
landholders
of
england
differed
from
those
of
the
continent
where
the
lesser
tenants
were
bound
only
to
serve
their
own
masters
and
might
and
in
fact
often
did
take
up
arms
against
the
king
william
removed
this
serious
defect
by
doing
so
he
did
the
country
an
incalculable
service
he
completed
the
organization
of
feudal
land
tenure
but
he
never
established
the
continental
system
of
feudal

the
partial
freedom
of
villenage
certain
free
tenants
or
sokemen
who
paid
a
fixed
rent
either
in
money
or
service
and
were
not
bound
to
the
soil
as
the
villeins
were
next
to
the
manor
house
where
courts
were
also
held
the
most
important
buildings
were
the
church
used
sometimes
for
markets
and
town
meetings
the
lord
mill
if
there
was
a
stream
in
which
all
tenants
must
grind
their
grain
and
pay
for
the
grinding
and
finally
the
cottages
of
the
tenants
gathered
in
a
village
near
the
mill
the
land
was
divided
as
follows
the
demesne
or
domain
surrounding
the
manor
house
this
was
strictly
private
the
ground
the
land
outside
the
demesne
suitable
for
cultivation
this
was
let
in
strips
usually
of
thirty
acres
but
was
subject
to
certain
rules
in
regard
to
methods
of
tillage
and
crops
a
piece
of
land
which
tenants
might
hire
and
use
as
they
saw
fit
common

open
to
all

their
cattle
on

to
cut
turf
for
feul

gather
plants
or

for

the
forest
or

where
all
tenants
had
the
right
to
turn
their

out
to

on

and
where
they
might
also
collect
a
certain
amound

ii
religion
the
church
with
respect
to
the
organization
of
the
church
no
changes
were
made
under
the
norman
kings
they
however
generally
deposed
the
english
bishops
and
substituted
normans
or
foreigners
who
as
a
class
were
superior
in
education
to
the
english
william
the
conqueror
made
it
pretty
clearly
understood
that
he
considered
the
church
subordinate
to
his
will
and
that
in
all
cases
of
dispute
about
temporal
matters
he
and
not
the
pope
was
to
decide
during
the
norman
period
great
numbers
of
monasteries
were
built
in
one
very
important
respect
william
the
conqueror
greatly
increased
the
power
of
the
church
by
establishing
ecclesiastical
courts
in
which
all
cases
relating
to
the
church
and
the
clergy
were
tried
by
the
bishops
according
to
laws
of
their
own
persons
wearing
the
dress
of
a
monk
or
priest
or
those
who
could
manage
to
spell
out
a
verse
of
the
psalms
and
so
pass
for
ecclesiastics
would
claim
the
right
to
be
tried
under
the
church
laws
and
as
the
punishments
which
the
church
inflicted
were
notoriously
mild
the
consequence
was
that
the
majority
of
criminals
escaped
the
penalty
of
their
evil
doings
so
great
was
the
abuse
of
this
privilege
that
at
a
later
period
henry
ii
made
an
attempt
to
reform
it
but
it
was
not
wholly
and
finally
done
away
with
until
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
iii
military
affairs
the
army
the
army
consisted
of
cavalry
or
knights
and
foot
soldiers
the
former
were
almost
wholly
normans
they
wore
armor
similar
to
that
used
by
the
saxons
it
is
represented
in
the
pictures
of
the
bayeux
tapestry
and
appears
to
have
consisted
of
leather
or
stout
linen
on
which
pieces
of
bone
or
scales
or
rings
of
iron
were
securely
sewed
later
these
rings
of
iron
were
set
up
edgewise
and
interlinked
or
the
scales
made
to
overlap
the
helmet
was
pointed
and
had
a
piece
in
front
to
protect
the
nose
the
shield
was
long
and
the
weapons
of
this
class
of
soldiers
consisted
of
a
lance
and
a
sword
the
foot
soldiers
wore
little
or
no
armor
and
fought
principally
with
long
bows
in
case
of
need
the
king
could
probably
muster
about
ten
thousand
knights
or
armed
horsemen
and
a
much
larger
force
of
foot
soldiers
under
the
norman
kings
the
principal
wars
were
insurrections
against
william
i
the
various
revolts
of
the
barons
and
the
civil
war
under
stephen
knighthood
candidates
for
knighthood
were
usually
obliged
to
pass
through
a
long
course
of
training
under
the
care
of
some
distinguished
noble
the
candidate
served
first
as
a
page
or
attendant
in
the
house
then
as
a
squire
or
attendant
he
followed
his
master
to
the
wars
after
seven
years
in
this
capacity
he
prepared
himself
for
receiving
the
honors
of
knighthood
by
spending
several
days
in
a
church
engaged
in
solemn
religious
rites
fasting
and
prayer
knighthood
originally
the
knight
was
a
youth
or
attendant
later
the
word
came
to
mean
an
armed
horse
soldier
or
cavalier
who
had
received
his
weapons
and
title
in
a
solemn
manner
as
a
rule
only
the
wealthy
and
noble
could
afford
the
expense
of
a
horse
and
armor
for
this
reason
chivalry
or
knighthood
came
to
be
closely
connected
with
the
idea
of
aristocracy
in
some
cases
soldiers
were
made
knights
on
the
battlefield
as
a
reward
for
valor
the
young
man
in
the
presence
of
his
friends
and
kindred
then
made
oath
to
be
loyal
to
the
king
to
defend
religion
and
to
be
the
champion
of
every
lady
in
danger
or
distress
next
a
dame
or
great
warrior
buckled
on
his
spurs
and
girded
the
sword
which
he
priest
had
blessed
to
his
side
this
done
he
knelt
to
the
prince
or
noble
who
was
to
perform
the
final
ceremony
the
prince
struck
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
with
the
flat
of
the
sword
saying
in
the
name
of
god
michael
and
george
the
patron
saint
of
england
i
dub
thee
knight
be
brave
hardy
and
loyal
michael
as
representative
of
the
triumphant
power
of
good
over
evil
then
the
young
cavalier
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
galloped
up
and
down
brandishing
his
weapon
in
token
of
strength
and
skill
in
case
a
knight
proved
false
to
his
oaths
he
was
publicly
degraded
his
spurs
were
taken
from
him
his
shield
was
reversed
his
armor
broken
to
pieces
and
a
sermon
preached
upon
him
in
the
neighboring
church
proclaiming
him
dead
to
the
order
iv
literature
learning
and
art
education
use
of
seals
or
stamps
the
leaning
of
this
period
was
confined
almost
wholly
to
the
clergy
whatever
schools
existed
were
connected
with
the
monasteries
and
nunneries
oxford
had
begun
to
be
regarded
as
a
seat
of
leaning
the
instruction
was
given
by
priests
though
some
noted
jewish
scholars
may
have
had
pupils
there
very
few
books
were
written
during
this
period
generally
speaking
the
nobility
considered
fighting
the
great
business
of
life
and
cared
nothing
for
education
they
thought
that
reading
and
writing
were
beneath
their
dignity
and
left
such
accomplishments
to
monks
priests
and
lawyers
for
this
reason
seals
or
stamps
having
some
device
or
signature
engraved
on
them
came
to
be
used
on
all
papers
of
importance
historical
works
the
bayeux
tapestry
the
chief
books
written
in
england
under
the
norman
kings
were
histories
of
these
the
most
noteworthy
were
the
continuation
of
the
chronicle
in
english
and
the
chronicles
of
william
of
malmesbury
and
henry
of
huntingdon
in
latin
william
book
and
the
saxon
chronicle
still
continue
to
be
of
great
importance
to
students
of
this
period
mention
has
already
been
made
of
the
bayeux

of
the

to
this
period
it
abounds
in
romances
about
king
arthur
tennyson
based
his
idylls
of
the
king
on
it
it
consists
of
a
series
of
scenes
or
pictures
done
about
the
time
of
william
accession
it
was
probably
intended
to
decorate
the
cathedral
of
bayeux
in
normandy
france
where
it
was
originally
placed
some
have
supposed
it
to
be
the
work
of
his
queen
matilda
the
entire
length
is
two
hundred
and
fourteen
feet
and
the
width
about
twenty
inches
it
represents
events
in
english
history
from
the
last
of
edward
the
confessor
reign
to
the
battle
of
hastings
as
a
guide
to
a
knowledge
of
the
armor
weapons
and
costume
of
the
period
it
is
of
very
great
value
the
tapestry
is
preserved
at
bayeux
architecture
under
the
norman
sovereigns
there
was
neither
painting
statuary
nor
poetry
worthy
of
mention
the
spirit
that
creats
these
arts
found
expression
in
architecture
introduced
from
the
continent
the
castle
cathedral
and
minster
with
here
and
there
an
exceptional
structure
like
the
tower
of
london
london
bridge
and
the
great
hall
at
westminster
built
by
william
rufus
were
some
norman
buildings
which
mark
the
time
all
were
of
stone
a
material
which
the
normans
generally
preferred
to
any
other
aside
from
westminster
abbey
which
although
the
work
of
edward
the
confessor
was
really
norman
a
fortress
or
two
like
coningsborough
in
yorkshire
and
a
few
churches
like
that
at
the
saxons
had
erected
little
of
note
the
characteristics
of
the
norman
style
of
architecture
was
its
massive
grandeur
the
churches
were
built
in
the
form
of
a
cross
with
a
square
central
tower
the
main
entrance
being
at
the
west
the
interior
was
divided
into
a
nave
or
central
portion
with
an
aisle
on
each
side
for
the
passage
of
religious
processions
the
windows
were
narrow
and
rounded
at
the
top
the
roof
rested
on
round
arches
supported
by
heavy
columns
the
cathedrals
of
peterborough
ely
durham
norwich
the
church
of
bartholomew
london
and
john
chapel
in
the
tower
of
london
are
fine
examples
of
norman
work
the
castles
consisted
of
a
square
keep
or
citadel
with
walls
of
immense
thickness
having
a
few
slitlike
windows
in
the
lower
story
and
somewhat
larger
ones
above
in
these
buildings
everything
was
made
subordinate
to
strength
and
security
they
were
surrounded
by
a
high
stone
wall
and
deep
ditch
generally
filled
with
water
the
entrance
to
them
was
over
a
drawbridge
through
an
archway
protected
by
an
iron
grating
or
portcullis

could
be
raised

successors
the
jews
houses
at
lincoln
and
edmundsbury
are
rare
and
excellent
examples
of
norman
domestic
architecture
although
in
many
cases
the
norman
castles
are
in
ruins
yet
these
ruins
bid
fair
to
stand
as
long
as
the
pyramids
they
were
mostly
the
work
of
churchmen
who
were
the
best
architects
of
the
day
and
knew
how
to
plan
a
fortress
as
well
as
to
build
a
minster
general
industry
and
commerce

no
very
marked
change
took
place
in
respect
to
agriculture
or
trade
during
the
norman
period
jews
are
mentioned
in
a
few
cases
in
saxon
records
but
they
apparently
did
not
enter
england
in
any
number
until
after
william
the
conqueror
accession
they
soon
got
control
of
much
of
the
trade
and
were
the
only
capitalists
of
the
time
they
were
protected
by
the
kings
in
money
lending
at
exorbitant
rates
of
interest
in
turn
the
kings
extorted
immense
sums
from
them
the
guilds
or
associations
for
mutual
protection
among
merchants
and
manufacturers
now
became
prominent
and
in
time
they
acquired
great
political
influence
vi

and
customs

the
normans
were
more
temperate
and
refined
in
their
mode
of
living
than
the
saxons
in
dress
they
made
great
display
in
henry
reign
it
became
the
custom
for
the
nobility
to
wear
their
hair
very
long
so
that
their
curls
resembled
those
of
women
the
clergy
thundered
against
this
effeminate
fashion
but
with
no
effect
at
last
a
priest
preaching
before
the
king
on
easter
sunday
ended
his
sermon
by
taking
out
a
pair
of
shears
and
cropping
the

in

and
at

in
winter
which
was
the
government
signal
for
putting
out
lights
and
covering
up
fires
this
law
which
was
especially
hated
by
the
english
as
a
norman
innovation
and
act
of
tyranny
was
a
necessary
precaution
against
fire
at
a
time
when
london
and
other
cities
were
masses
of
wooden
hovels
surnames
came
in
with
the
normans
previous
to
the
conquest
englishmen
had
but
one
name
and
when
for
convenience
another
was
needed
they
were
called
by
their
occupation
or
from
some
personal
peculiarity
as
edward
the
carpenter
harold
the
dauntless
among
the
normans
the
lack
of
a
second

family
name
had
come
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
sign
of
low
birth

the
title
of

the
name

by
which
the

came
to
be

was
derived
from
the
count
habit
of
wearing
a
sprig
of
the

called
it

he
acquired
the
great
southern

thus
on

ireland
by
the
normans
was
a
radically
different
thing
they
and
the
irish
had
really
nothing
in
common
the
latter
refused
to
accept
the
feudal
system
and
continued
to
split
up
into
savage
tribes
or
clans
under
the
rule
of
petty
chiefs
always
at
war
with
each
other
thus
for
centuries
after
england
had
established
a
settled
government
ireland
remained
partly
through
the
battles
of
the
clans
and
partly
through
the
aggressions
of
a
hostile
race
in
a
state
of
anarchic
confusion
which
prevented
all
true
national
growth

charter
and
reforms
on
his
mother
side
henry
was
a
descendent
of
alfred
the
great
for
this
reason
he
was
hailed
with
enthusiasm
by
the
native
english
he
at
once
began
a
system
of
reforms
worthy
of
his
illustrious
ancestor
his
first
act
was
to
issue
a
charter
confirming
the
charter
of
liberties
or
pledges
of
good
government
which
his
grandfather
henry
i
had
made
his
next
was
to
begin
leveling
to
the
ground
the
castles
unlawfully
built
in
stephen
reign
which
had
caused
such
widespread
misery
to
the
country
he
continued
the
work
of
demolition
until
it
is
said
he
destroyed
no
less
than
eleven
hundred
of
these
strongholds
of
oppression
under
william
the
conqueror
and
his
immediate
successors
no
one
was
allowed
to
erect
a
castle
without
a
royal
license
during
stephen
time
the
great
barons
constantly
violated
this
salutory
regulation
the
king
next
turned
his
attention
to
the
coinage
during
the
civil
war
the
barons
had
issued
money
debased
in
quality
and
deficient
in
weight
henry
abolished
this
dishonest
currency
and
issued
silver
pieces
of
full
weight
and
value
war
with
france
scutage
having
completed
these
reforms
the
king
turned
his
attention
to
his
continental
possessions
through
his
wife
henry
claimed
the
county
of
toulouse
in
southern
france
to
enforce
this
claim
he
declared
war
henry
barons
however
refused
to
furnish
troops
to
fight
outside
of
england
the
king
wisely
compromised
the
matter
by
offering
to
accept
from
each
knight
a
sum
of
money
in
lieu
of
service
called
scutage
or
shield
money
the
proposal
was
agreed
to
and
in
this
way
the
knights
furnished
the
king
the
means
to
hire
soldiers
for
foreign
wars
scutage
from
the
latin
scutum
a
shield
the
understanding
being
that
he
who
would
not
take
his
shield
and
do
battle
for
the
king
should
pay
enough
to
hire
one
who
would
the
scutage
was
assessed
at
two
marks
later
the
assessment
varied
the
mark
was
two
thirds
of
a
pound
of
silver
by
weight
or
thirteen
shillings
and
fourpence
reckoned
in
modern
money
the
tax
was
probably
at
least
twenty
times
two
marks
or
about
later
in
his
reign
henry
supplemented
this
tax
by
the
passage
of
the
assize
of
arms
a
law
which
revived
the
national
militia
and
placed
it
at
his
command
for
home
service
by
these
two
measures
the
king
made
himself
practically
independent
of
the
barons
and
thus
gained
a
greater
degree
of
power
than
any
previous
ruler
had
possessed
thomas
becket
there
was
however
one
man
in
henry
kingdom
his
lord
chancellor
thomas
becket
who
was
always
ready
to
serve
him
at
his
own
expense
the
chancellor
now
equipped
seven
hundred
knights
and
crossing
the
channel
fought
valiantly
for
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
in
toulouse
in
the
south
of
france
see
map
facing
p
shortly
after
becket
return
from
the
continent
henry
resolved
to
appoint
him
archbishop
of
canterbury
becket
knew
that
the
king
purposed
beginning
certain
church
reforms
with
which
he
was
not
in
sympathy
and
declined
the
office
but
henry
would
take
no
denial
at
last
becket
consented
but
he
warned
the
king
that
he
should
uphold
the
rights
of
the
clergy
he
now
became
the
head
of
the
catholic
church
in
england
he
was
the
first
man
of
english
birth
called
to
that
exalted
position
since
the
norman
conquest
this
promotion
made
a
decided
change
in
becket
relation
to
the
king
so
long
as
he
was
chancellor
he
was
bound
to
do
what
the
king
ordered
but
as
soon
as
he
was
made
archbishop
he
became
the
servant
of
the
church
again
on
his
assumption
of
this
sacred
office
becket
underwent
a
remarkable
charge
of
character
he
had
been
a
man
of
the
world
fond
of
pomp
and
pleasure
he
now
gave
up
all
luxury
and
show
he
put
on
sackcloth
lived
on
bread
and
water
and
spent
his
nights
in
prayer
tearing
his
flesh
with
a
scourge
becket
first
quarrel
with
the
king
the
new
archbishop
presentiment
of
trouble
soon
proved
true
becket
had
hardly
taken
his
seat
when
a
quarrel
broke
out
between
him
and
the
king
in
his
need
for
money
henry
levied
a
tax
on
all
lands
whether
belonging
to
the
barons
or
to
churchmen
becket
opposed
this
tax
he
was
willing
he
said
that
the
clergy
should
contribute
if
they
desired
to
do
so
but
not
that
they
should
be
compelled
to
pay
the
tax
see
page
note
on
clergy
the
king
declared
with
an
oath
that
all
should
pay
alike
the
archbishop
vowed
with
equal
determination
that
not
a
single
penny
should
be
collected
from
the
church
from
that
time
the
king
and
becket
never
met
again
as
friends
the
second
quarrel
shortly
afterward
a
much
more
serious
quarrel
broke
out
between
the
king
and
the
archbishop
under
the
law
made
by
william
the
conqueror
the
church
had
the
right
to
try
in
its
own
courts
all
offenses
committed
by
monks
and
priests
this
privilege
in
time
led
to
great
abuses
since
even
in
cases
of
the
commission
of
the
gravest
crimes
the
church
had
no
direct
power
to
inflict
the
penalty
of
death
on
the
contrary
the
heaviest
sentence
it
could
give
was
imprisonment
in
a
monastery
with
degradation
from
the
clerical
office
while
in
less
serious
cases
the
offenders
generally
got
off
with
fasting
and
flogging
on
this
account
some
criminals
who
deserved
to
be
hanged
escaped
with
a
comparatively
slight
penalty
such
a
case
now
occurred
in
one
instance
a
priest
had
committed
an
unprovoked
murder
henry
commanded
him
to
be
brought
before
the
kings
court
becket
interfered
and
ordered
the
case
to
be
tried
by
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
the
bishop
simply
sentenced
the
murderer
to
lose
his
place
for
two
years
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
the
king
determined
that
such
flagrant
disregard
of
justice
should
no
longer
go
on
he
called
a
council
of
his
chief
men
at
clarendon
near
salisbury
in
wiltshire
and
laid
the
case
before
them
he
demanded
that
in
future
the
state
or
civil
courts
should
be
supreme
and
that
in
every
instance
their
judges
should
decide
whether
a
criminal
should
be
tried
by
the
common
law
of
the
land
or
handed
over
to
the
church
courts
he
furthermore
required
that
the
clergy
should
be
held
strictly
responsible
to
the
crown
so
that
in
case
of
dispute
the
final
appeal
should
be
neither
to
the
archbishop
nor
to
the
pope
but
to
himself
in
this
respect
he
went
even
farther
than
william
the
conqueror
had
done
after
protracted
debate
the
council
composed
of
a
committee
of
bishops
and
barons
passed
the
measures
which
the
king
demanded
the
new
laws
were
entitled
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
they
consisted
of
sixteen
articles
which
clearly
defined
the
powers
and
jurisdiction
of
the
king
courts
and
the
church
courts
their
great
object
was
to
secure
a
more
uniform
administration
of
justice
for
all
classes
of
men
see
the
constitutional
summary
in
the
appendix
pp
viii
and
xxxii
becket
though
bitterly
oppsed
to
the
new
laws
finally
assented
and
swore
to
obey
them
afterward
feeling
that
he
had
conceded
too
much
he
retracted
his
oath
and
refused
to
be
bound
by
the
constitutions
the
other
church
dignitaries
became
alarmed
at
the
prospect
and
left
becket
to
settle
with
the
king
as
best
he
might
henceforth
it
was
a
battle
between
the
king
and
the
archbishop
and
each
resolved
that
he
would
never
give
up
until
he
had
won
the
final
victory
the
king
enforces
the
new
laws
becket
leaves
the
country
henry
at
once
proceeded
to
put
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
into
execution
without
fear
or
favor
a
champion
of
the
church
of
that
day
says
then
was
seen
the
mournful
spectacle
of
priests
and
deacons
who
had
committed
murder
manslaughter
robbery
theft
and
other
crimes
carried
in
carts
before
the
comissioners
and
punished
as
thogh
they
were
ordinary
men
william
of
newburgh
chronicle
furthermore
the
king
sems
now
to
have
resolved
to
ruin
becket
or
drive
him
from
the
kingdom
he
accordingly
summoned
the
archbishop
before
a
royal
council
at
northampton
to
answer
to
certain
charges
made
against
him
becket
answered
the
summons
but
he
refused
to
acknowledge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
council
and
appealed
to
the
pope
traitor
cried
a
courtier
as
he
picked
up
a
bunch
of
muddy
rushes
from
the
floor
and
flung
them
at
the
archbishop
head
becket
turned
and
looking
him
sternly
in
the
face
said
were
i
not
a
churchman
i
would
make
you
repent
that
word
realizing
however
that
he
was
now
in
serious
danger
he
soon
after
left
northampton
and
fled
to
france
banishment
versus
excommunication
finding
becket
beyond
his
reach
henry
next
proceeded
to
banish
the
archbishop
kinsmen
and
friends
without
regard
to
age
or
sex
to
the
number
of
nearly
four
hundred
these
miserable
exiles
many
of
whom
were
nearly
destitute
were
forced
to
leave
the
country
in
midwinter
and
excited
the
pity
of
all
who
saw
them
becket
indignantly
retaliated
he
hurled
at
the
king
counselors
the
awful
sentence
of
excommunication
or
expulsion
from
the
church
it
declared
the
king
accursed
of
god
and
man
deprived
of
help
in
this
world
and
shut
out
from
hope
in
the
world
to
come
in
this
manner
the
quarrel
went
on
with
bitterness
for
the
space
of
six
years
prince
henry
crowned
reconciliation
henry
who
had
long
wished
to
associate
his
son
prince
henry
with
him
in
the
government
had
him
crowned
at
westminster
by
the
archbishop
of
york
the
bishops
of
london
and
salisbury
taking
part
by
custom
if
not
indeed
by
law
becket
alone
as
archbishop
of
canterbury
had
the
right
to
perform
this
ceremony
when
becket
heard
of
the
coronation
he
declared
it
an
outrage
both
against
christianity
and
the
church
so
great
an
outcry
now
arose
that
henry
believed
it
expedient
to
recall
the
absent
archbishop
especially
as
the
king
of
france
was
urging
the
pope
to
take
up
the
matter
henry
accordingly
went
over
to
the
continent
met
becket
and
persuaded
him
to
return
reneral
of
the
quarrel
murder
of
becket
but
though
the
archbishop
and
the
king
had
given
each
other
the
kiss
of
peace
yet
the
reconciliation
was
on
the
surface
only
underneath
the
old
hatred
smoldered
ready
to
burst
forth
into
flame
as
soon
as
he
reached
england
becket
invoked
the
thunders
of
the
church
against
those
who
had
officiated
at
the
coronation
of
prince
henry
he
excommunicated
the
archbishop
of
york
with
his
assistant
bishops
the
king
took
their
part
and
in
an
outburst
of
passion
against
becket
he
exclaimed
will
none
of
the
cowards
who
eat
my
bread
rid
me
of
that
turbulent
priest
in
answer
to
his
angry
cry
for
relief
four
knights
set
out
without
henry
knowledge
for
canterbury
and
brutally
murdered
the
archbishop
within
the
walls
of
his
own
cathedral
results
of
the
murder
the
crime
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
throughout
the
realm
the
pope
proclaimed
becket
a
saint
with
the
title
of
saint
thomas
the
mass
of
the
english
people
looked
upon
the
dead
ecclesiastic
as
a
martyr
who
had
died
in
the
defense
of
the
church
and
of
all
those
but
especially
the
laboring
classes
and
the
poor
around
whom
the
church
cast
its
protecting
power
the
great
cathedral
of
canterbury
was
hung
in
mourning
shrine
became
the
most
famous
in
england
the
stone
pavement
and
the
steps
leading
to
it
still
show
by
their
hollows
where
thousands
of
pilgrims
coming
from
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
and
from
the
continent
even
used
to
creep
on
their
knees
to
the
saint
tomb
to
pray
for
his
intercession
henry
himself
was
so
far
vanquished
by
the
reaction
in
becket
favor
that
he
gave
up
any
further
attempt
to
formally
enforce
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
by
which
he
had
hoped
to
establish
a
uniform
system
of
administration
of
justice
but
the
attempt
though
baffled
was
not
wholly
lost
like
seed
buried
in
the
soil
it
sprang
up
and
bore
good
fruit
in
later
generations
however
it
was
not
until
near
the
close
of
the
reign
of
george
iii
that
the
civil
courts
fully
and
finally
prevailed
the
king
makes
his
will

some
years
after
the
murder
the
king
bequeathed
england
and
normandy
to
prince
henry
he
at
the
same
time
provided
for
his
sons
geoffrey
and
richard
to
john
the
youngest
of
the
brothers
he
gave
no
territory
but
requested
henry
to
grant
him
several
castles
which
the
latter
refused
to
do
it
is
our
fate
said
one
of
the
sons
that
none
should
love
the
rest
that
is
the
only
inheritance
which
will
never
be
taken
from
us
after
his
coronation
prince
henry
had
the
title
of
henry
iii
but
as
he
died
before
his
father
he
never
properly
became
king
in
his
own
right
it
may
be
that
that
legacy
of
hatred
was
the
result
of
henry
unwise
marriage
with
eleanor
an
able
but
perverse
woman
or
it
may
have
sprung
from
her
jealousy
of
fair
rosamond
and
other
favorites
of
the
king
eventually
this
feeling
burst
out
into
civil
war

fought
against

conspiring
with
the
king
of
france
turned
against
her
husband
fair
rosamond
rosa
mundi
the
rose
of
the
world
as
then
interpreted
was
the
daughter
of
lord
clifford
according
to
tradition
the
king
formed
an
attachment
for
this
lady
before
his
unfortunate
marriage
with
eleanor
and
constructed
a
place
of
concealment
for
her
in
a
forest
in
woodstock
near
oxford
some
accounts
report
that
queen
eleanor
discovered
her
rival
and
put
her
to
death
she
was
buried
in
the
nunnery
of
godstow
near

began
in

while
he
was
engaged
in
quelling
it
he
received
intelligence
that
earl
bigod
of
norfolk
and
the
bishop
of
durham
both
of
whom
hated
the
reforms
since
they
curtailed
their
authority

risen
against
him
hugh
bigod
the
bigods
were
among
the
most
prominent
and
also
the
most
turbulent
of
the
norman
barons
believing
that
this
new
trouble
was
a
judgment
from
heaven
for
becket
murder
henry
resolved
to
do
penance
at
his
tomb
leaving
the
continent
with
two
prisoners
in
his
charge
one
his
son

the
other

traveled
with
all
speed
to

there
kneeling
abjectly
before
the
grave
of
his
former
chancellor
and

submitted
to
be
beaten
with
rods
by
the
priests
in
expiation
of
his
sin
end
of
the
struggle
of
the
barons
against

then
moved
against
the
rebels
in
the
north
convinced
of
the
hopelessness
of
holding
out
against
his
forces
they
submitted
with
their
submission
the
long
struggle
of
the
barons
against
the
crown
came
to
an
end
it
had
lasted
nearly
a
hundred
years
the
king
victory
in
this
contest
was
of
the
greatest
importance
it
settled
the
question
once
for
all
that
england
was
not
like
the
rest
of
europe
to
be
managed
in
the
interest
of
a
body
of
great
baronial
landholders
always
at
war
with
each
other
but
was
henceforth
to
be
governed
by

central
power

not

of

once
more
set
about
completing
his
legal
and
judicial
reforms
his
great
object
was
to
secure
a
uniform
system
of
administering
justice
which
should
be
effective
and
impartial
henry
i
had
undertaken
to
divide
the
kingdom
into
districts
or
circuits
which
were
assigned
to
a
certain
number
of
judges
who
traveled
through
them
at
stated
times
collecting
the
royal
revenue
and
administering
the
law
henry
ii
revised
and
perfected
this
plan
this
was
accomplished
by
means
of
two
laws
called
the
grand
assize
and
the
assize
of
clarendon
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
the
assize
of
clarendon
was
the
first
true
code
of
national
law
it
was
later
expanded
and
made
permanent
under
the
name
of
the
assize
of
northampton
see
the
constitutional
summary
in
the
appendix
vii
in
addition
to
the
private
courts
which
under
feudal
law
the
barons
had
set
up
on
their
estates
they
had
in
many
cases
got
the
entire
control
of
the
town
and
other
local
courts
there
they
dealt
out
such
justice
or
injustice
as
they
pleased
the
king
judges
now
assumed
control
of
these
tribunals
and
so
brought
the
common
law
of
the
realm
to
every
man
door
grand
juries
the
norman
method
of
settling
disputed
was
by
trial
by
battle
in
which
the
contestants
or
their
champions
fought
the
matter
out
either
with
swords
or
cudgels
there
were
those
who
objected
to
this
club
law
to
them
the
king
offered
the
privilege
of
leaving
the
decision
of
twelve
knights
chosen
from
the
neighborhood
who
were
supposed
to
know
the
facts
see
the
constitutional
summary
in
the
appendix
vi
in
like
manner
when
the
judges
passed
through
a
circuit
a
grand
jury
of
not
less
than
sixteen
was
to
report
to
them
the
criminals
of
each
district
these
the
judges
forthwith
sent
to
the
church
to
be
examined
by
the
ordeal
if
convicted
they
were
punished
if
not
the
judges
considered
them
to
be
suspicious
characters
and
ordered
them
to
leave
the
country
within
eight
days
in
that
way
the
rascals
of
that
generation
were
summarily
disposed
of
henry
ii
may
rightfully
be
regarded
as
having
taken
the
first
step
toward
founding
the
system
of
trial
by
jury
which
england
and
england
alone
fully
matured
that
method
has
since
been
adopted
by
every
civilized
country
of
the
globe

vii
origin
of
the
modern
trial
by
jury
in
the
reign
of
henry
son
john
the
church
abolished
the
ordeal
throughout
christendom
it
then
became
the
custom
in
england
to
choose
a
petty
jury
acquainted
with
the
facts
whoch
confirmed
or
denied
the
accusations
brought
by
the
grand
jury
when
this
petty
jury
could
not
agree
the
decision
of
a
majority
was
sometimes
accepted
the
difficulty
of
securing
justice
by
this
method
led
to
the
custom
of
summoning
witnesses
these
witnesses
appeared
before
the
petty
jury
and
testified
for
or
against
the
party
accused
in
this
way
it
became
possible
to
obtain
a
unanimous
verdict
the
first
mention
of
this
change
occurs
more
than
a
hundred
and
thirty
years
later
in
the
reign
of
edward
iii
and
from
that
time
perhaps
may
be
dated
the
true
beginning
of
our
modern
method
by
which
the
jury
bring
in
a
verdict
not
from
what
they
personally
know
but
from
evidence
sworn
to
by
those
who
do
the
king
last
days
henry
last
days
were
full
of
bitterness
ever
since
his
memorable
return
from
the
continent
he
had
been
obliged
to
hold
the
queen
a
prisoner
lest
she
should
undermine
his
power
his
sons
were
discontented
and
rebellious
toward
the
close
of
his
reign
they
again
plotted
against
him
with
king
philip
of
france
henry
then
declared
war
against
that
country
when
peace
was
made
henry
who
was
lying
ill
asked
to
see
a
list
of
those
who
had
conspired
against
him
at
the
head
of
it
stood
the
name
of
his
youngest
son
john
whom
he
trusted
at
the
sight
of
it
the
old
man
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
saying
i
have
nothing
left
to
care
for
let
all
things
go
their
way
two
days
afterward
he
died
of
a
broken
heart
summary
henry
ii
left
his
work
only
half
done
yet
that
half
was
permanent
and
its
beneficent
mark
may
be
seen
on
the
english
law
and
the
english
constitution
at
the
present
time
when
he
ascended
the
throne
he
found
a
people
who
had
long
been
suffering
the
miseries
of
a
protracted
civil
war
he
established
a
stable
government
he
redressed
the
wrongs
of
his
people
he
punished
the
mutinous
barons
he
compelled
the
church
at
least
in
some
degree
to
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
the
state
he
reformed
the
administration
of
law
established
methods
of
judicial
inquiry
which
gradually
developed
into
our
modern
trial
by
jury
and
he
made
all
men
feel
that
a
king
sat
on
the
throne
who
believed
in
a
uniform
system
of
justice
and
who
endeavered
to
make
it

coeur
de
lion
richard
the
an
old
chronicler
says
that
the
king
got
the
name
from
his
adventure
with
a
lion
the
beast
attacked
him
and
as
the
king
had
no
weapons
he
thrust
his
hand
down
his
throat
and
tore
out
his
heart
this
story
is
not
without
value
since
it
illustrates
how
marvelous
legends
grow
up
around
the
lives
of
remarkable
men
the
only
english
sentence
that
he
was
ever
known
to
speak
was
when
he
was
in
a
raging
passion
he
then
vented
his
wrath
against
an
impertinent
frnchman
in
some
broken
but
decidedly
strong
expressions
of
his
native
tongue
richard
has
been
called
a
spendid
savage
having
most
of
the
faults
and
most
of
the
virtues
of
such
a
savage
the
king
bravery
in
battle
and
his
daring
exploits
gained
for
him
the
flattering
surname
of
coeur
de
lion
he
had
a
right
to
it
for
he
certainly
possessed
the
heart
of
a
lion
and
he
never
failed
to
get
the
lion
share
he
might
however
have
been
called
in
equal
truth
richard
the
absentee
since
out
of
a
nominal
reign
of
ten
years
he
spent
but
a
few
months

condition
of
society
perhaps
no
better
general
picture
of
society
in
england
during
this
period
can
be
found
than
that
presented
by
sir
walter
scott
novel
ivanhoe
there
every
class
appears
one
sees
the
saxon
serf
and
swineherd
wearing
the
brazen
collar
of
his
master
cedric
the
pilgrim
wandering
from
shrine
to
shrine
with
the
palm
branch
in
his
cap
to
show
that
he
has
visited
the
holy
land
the
outlaw
robin
hood
lying
in
wait
to
strip
rich
churchmen
and
other
travelers
who
were
on
their
way
through
sherwood
forest
he
sees
too
the
norman
baron
in
his
castle
torturing
the
aged
jew
to
extort
his
hidden
gold
and
the
knights

ivanhoe
at
their
head
splintering
lances
in
the
tournament
presided
over
by
richard
brother

traitorous
prince
john
richard
coronation
richard
was
on
the
continent
at
the
time
of
his
father
death
his
first
act
was
to
liberate
his
mother
from
her
long
imprisonment
at
winchester
his
next
to
place
her
at
the
head
of
the
english
government
until
his
arrival
from
normandy
unlike
henry
ii
richard
did
not
issue
a
charter
or
pledge
of
good
government
he
however
took
the
usual
coronation
oath
to
defend
the
church
maintain
justice
make
salutary
laws
and
abolish
evil
customs
such
an
oath
might
well
be
considered
a
charter
in
itself
the
crusades
how
richard
raised
money
at
that
period
all
western
europe
was
engaged
in
the
series
of
wars
known
as
the
crusades
the
object
of
this
long
contest
which
began
in
and
ended
in
was
to
compel
the
saracens
or
mohammedans
to
give
up
possession
of
the
holy
land
to
the
christians
immediately
after
his
coronation
richard
resolved
to
jion
the
king
of
france
and
the
emperor
of
germany
in
the
third
crusade
to
get
money
for
the
expedition
the
king
extorted
loans
from
the
jews
who
were
the
creditors
of
half
england
and
had
almost
complete
control
of
the
capital
and
commerce
of
every
country
in
europe
the
english
nobles
who
joined
richard
also
borrowed
largely
from
the
same
source
and
then
suddenly
turning
on
the
hated
lenders
they
tried
to
extinguish
the
debt
by
extinguishing
the
jews
a
pretext
against
the
unfortunate
race
was
easily
found
riots
broke
out
in
london
york
and
elsewhere
and
hundreds
of
israelites
were
brutally
massacred
richard
next
move
to
obtain
funds
was
to
impose
a
heavy
tax
his
next
to
dispose
of
titles
of
rank
and
offices
in
both
church
and
state
to
all
who
wished
to
buy
them
thus
to
the
aged
and
covetous
bishop
of
durhap
he
sold
the
earldom
of
northumberland
for
life
saying
as
he
concluded
the
bargain
out
of
an
old
bishop
i
have
made
a
new
earl
he
sold
also
the
office
of
chief
justice
to
the
same
prelate
for
an
additional
thousand
marks
note
while
the
king
of
scotland
purchased
freedom
from
subjection
to
the
english
king
for
ten
thousand
marks
last
of
all
richard
sold
cities
and
town
and
he
also
sold
charters
to
towns
one
of
his
courtiers
remonstrated
with
him
for
his
greed
for
gain
the
king
replied
i
would
sell
london
itself
could
i
find
a
purchaser
rich
enough
to
buy
it
the
rise
of
the
free
towns
of
all
these
devices
for
raising
money
that
of
selling
charters
to
towns
had
the
most
important
results
from
the
time
of
the
norman
conquest
the
large
towns
of
england
with
few
exceptions
were
considered
part
of
the
king
property
the
smaller
places
generally
belonged
to
the
great
barons
the
citizens
of
these
towns
were
obliged
to
pay
rent
and
taxes
of
various
kinds
to
the
king
or
lord
who
owned
them
these
dues
were
collected
by
an
officer
appointed
by
the
king
or
lord
usually
the
sheriff
who
was
bound
to
obtain
a
certain
sum
whatever
more
he
could
get
being
his
own
profit
for
this
reason
it
was
for
his
interest
to
exact
from
every
citizen
the
uttermost
penny
london
as
we
have
seen
had
secured
a
considerable
degree
of
liberty
through
the
charter
granted
to
it
by
william
the
conqueror
every
town
was
now
anxious
to
obtain
a
similar
charter
the
three
great
objects
which
the
citizens
of
the
towns
sought
were
to
get
the
right
of
paying
their
taxes
directly
to
the
king
to
elect
their
own
magistrates
to
administer
justice
in
their
own
courts
in
accordance
with
laws
made
by
themselves
the
only
way
to
gain
these
privileges
was
to
pay
for
them
many
of
the
towns
were
rich
and
if
the
king
or
lord
needed
money
they
bargained
with
him
for
the
favors
they
desired
when
the
agreement
was
made
it
was
drawn
up
in
latin
and
stamped
with
the
king
seal
then
the
citizens
took
it
home
in
triumph
and
locked
it
up
as
the
safeguard
of
their
liberties
or
at
least
of
some
part
of
them
thus
the
people
of
leicester
in
the
next
reign
purchased
from
the
earl
of
leicester
their
feudal
lord
the
right
to
decide
their
own
disputes
for
this
they
payed
a
yearly
tax
of
threepence
on
every
house
having
a
gable
on
the
main
street
these
concessions
may
seem
small
but
they
prepared
the
way
for
greater
ones
what
was
still
more
important
these
charters
educated
the
citizens
of
the
day
in
a
knowledge
of
the
tradesmen
and
shopkeepers
of
these
towns
did
much
to
preserve
free
speech
and
equal
justice
richard
granted
a
large
number
of
these
town
charters
and
thus
unintentionally
made
himself
a
benefactor
to
the
nation
rise
of
free
towns
by
the
most
advanced
of
the
english
towns
had
become
to
a
very
considerable
extent

the
third

the
object
of
the
third
crusade
was
to
drive
the
mohammedans
from
jerusalem
in
this
it
failed
richard
got
as
near
jerusalem
as
the
mount
of
olives
when
he
had
climbed
to
the
top
he
was
told
that
he
could
have
a
full

of
the
place
but
he
covered
his
face
with
his
mantle
saying

let
me
not
see
thy
holy
city
since
i
may
not
deliver
it

who
held
him
captive
his
brother
john
who
had
remained
in
england
plotted
with
philip
of
france
to
keep
richard
in
prison
while
he
got
possession
of
the
throne
it
is
not
certainly
known
how
the
news
of
richard
captivity
reached
england
one
account
relates
that
it
was
carried
by
blondel
a
minstrel
who
had
accompanied
the
king
to
palestine
he
it
is
said
wandered
through
germany
in
search
of
his
master
singing
a
song
which
he
and
richard
had
composed
together
at
every
castle
he
came
to
one
day
as
he
was
thus
singing
at
the
foot
of
a
tower
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
king
take
up
the
next
verse
in
reply
finally
richard
regained
his
liberty
but
to
do
it
he
had
to
raise
an
enormous
ransom
every
englishman
it
was
said
was
obliged
to
give
a
fourth
of
his
personal
property
and
the
priests
were
forced
to
strip
the
churches
of
their
jewels
and
silver
plate
when
the
king
of
france
heard
that
the
ransom
money
had
at
length
been
raised
he
wrote
to
john
telling
him
that
his
brother
was
free
look
out
for
yourself
said
he
the
devil
has
broken
loose
richard
generously
pardoned
his
treacherous
brother
and
when
the
king
was
killed
in
a
war
in
france
john
gained
the
throne
he
coveted
but
gained
it
only
to
disgrace
it
purpose
of
the
crusades
up
to
the
time
of
the
crusades
the
english
when
they
entered
upon
continental
wars
had
been
actuated
either
by
ambition
for
military
glory
or
desire
for
conquest
but
they
undertook
the
crusades
from
motives
of
religious
enthusiasm
those
who
engaged
in
them
fought
for
an
idea
they
considered
themselves
soldiers
of
the
cross
moved
by
this
feeling
all
christian
believers
seemed
redy
to
precipitate
themselves
in
one
united
body
upon
asia
thus
the
crusades
were
the
first
european
event
they
gave
men
something
noble
to
battle
for
not
only
outside
their
country
but
outside
their
own
selfish
interests
guizot
history
of
civilization
richard
as
we
have
seen
was
the
first
english
king
who
took
part
in
them
before
that
period
england
had
stood
aloof
a
world
by
itself
the
country
was
engaged
in
its
own
affairs
or
in
its
contests
with
france
richard
expedition
to
the
holy
land
brought
england
into
the
main
current
of
history
so
that
it
was
now
moved
by
the
same
feeling
which
animated
the
continent
the
results
of
the
crusades
educational
social
political
from
a
purely
military
point
of
view
the
crusades
ended
in
disastrous
failure
for
they
left
the
mohammedans
in
absolute
possession
of
the
holy
land
although
this
is
the
twentieth
century
since
the
birth
of
christ
the
mohammedans
still
continue
in
that
possession
but
in
spite
of
their
failure
these
wars
brought
great
good
to
england
in
many
respects
the
civilization
of
the
east
was
far
in
advance
of
the
west
one
result
of
the
crusades
was
to
open
the
eyes
of
europe
to
this
fact
when
richard
and
his
followers
set
out
they
looked
upon
the
mohammedans
as
barbarians
before
they
returned
many
were
ready
to
acknowledge
that
the
barbarians
were
chiefly
among
themselves
at
that
time
england
had
few
latin
and
no
greek
scholars
the
saracens
or
mohammedans
however
had
long
been
familiar
with
the
classics
and
had
translated
them
into
their
own
tongue
not
only
did
england
gain
its
first
knowledge
of
the
philosophy
of
plato
and
aristotle
from
mohammedan
teachers
but
it
also
received
from
them
the
elements
of
arithmetic
algebra
geometry
and
astronomy
this
new
knowledge
gave
a
great
impulse
to
education
and
had
a
most
important
influence
on
the
growth
of
the
universities
of
cambridge
and
oxford
though
these
institutions
did
not
become
prominent
until
more
than
a
century
later
had
these
been
the
only
results
they
would
still
perhaps
have
been
worth
all
the
blood
and
treasure
spent
by
the
crusaders
in
their
vain
attempts
to
recover
the
permanent
possession
of
the
sepulcher
of
christ
but
these
were
by
no
means
all
the
crusades
brought
about
a
social
and
political
revolution
they
conferred
benefits
and
removed
evils
when
they
began
the
greater
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
western
europe
including
england
were
chained
to
the
soil
they
had
neither
freedom
property
nor
knowledge
there
were
in
fact
but
three
classes
who
really
deserved
the
name
of
citizens
and
freemen
these
were
the
churchmen
comprising
the
clergy
monks
and
other
ecclesiastics
the
nobles
and
the
inhabitants
of
certain
favored
towns
the
effect
of
the
crusades
was
to
increase
the
number
of
this
last
class
we
have
seen
that
richard
was
compelled
by
his
need
of
money
to
grant
charters
conferring
local
on
many
towns
for
a
similar
reason
the
great
nobles
often
granted
the
same
powers
to
towns
which
they
controlled
the
result
was
that
their
immense
estates
were
broken
up
in
some
measure
it
was
from
this
period
says
the
historian
gibbon
that
the
common
people
living
in
these
chartered
towns
began
to
acquire
political
rights
and
what
is
more
to
defend
them
summary
we
may
say
in
closing
that
the
central
fact
in
richard
reign
was
his
embarking
in
the
crusades
from
them
directly
or
indirectly
england
gained
two
important
advantages
first
a
greater
degree
of
political
liberty
especially
in
the
case
of
the
towns
secondly
a
new
intellectual
and
educational
impulse

john
refused

a

in

mysteriously
disappeared

john
as

man
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
him
he
was
loathed
by
every
one
who
knew
him
summary
john
reign
may
be
regarded
as
a
turning
point
in
english
history
through
the
loss
of
normandy
the
norman
nobility
found
it
for
their
interest
to
make
the
welfare
of
england
and
of
the
english
race
one
with
their
own
thus
the
two
peoples
became
more
and
more
united
until
finally
all
differences
ceased
in
demanding
and
obtainign
the
great
charter
the
church
and
the
nobility
made
common
cause
with
all
classes
of
the
people
that
document
represents
the
victory
of
the
entire
nation
we
shall
see
that
the
next
eighty
years
will
be
mainly
taken
up
with
the
efforts
of
the
nation
to
hold
fast
to
what
it
had
gained
henry
iii
accession
and
character
john
eldest
son
henry
was
crowned
at
the
age
of
nine
during
his
long
and
feeble
reign
of
years
england
motto
might
well
have
been
the
warning
words
of
scripture
woe
to
thee
o
land
when
thy
king
is
a
child
since
a
child
he
remained
to
the
last
for
if
john
heart
was
of
millstone
henry
was
of
wax
dante
in
one
of
his
poems
written
perhaps
not
long
after
death
represents
him
as
he
sees
him
in
imagination
just
on
the
borderland
of
purgatory
the
king
is
not
in
suffering
for
as
he
has
done
no
particular
good
so
he
has
done
no
great
harm
he
appears
as
a
man
of
simple
life
spending
his
time
singing
psalms
in
a
narrow
valley
that
shows
one
side
of
his
negative
character
the
other
was
his
love
of
extravagance
vain
display
and
instability
of
purpose
much
of
the
time
he
drifted
about
like
a
ship
without
compass
or
rudder
reissue
of
the
great
charter
louis
the
french
prince
who
had
come
to
england
in
john
reign
as
an
armed
claimant
to
the
throne
finding
that
both
the
barons
and
the
church
preferred
an
english
to
a
foreign
king
now
retired
during
his
minority
henry
guardians
twice
reissued
the
great
charter
first
with
the
omission
of
the
article
which
reserved
the
power
of
taxation
to
the
national
council
no
and
secondly
with
an
addition
declaring
that
no
man
should
lose
life
or
limb
for
hunting
in
the
royal
forests
on
the
last
occasion
the
council
granted
the
king
in
return
a
fifteenth
of
their
movable
or
personal
property
this
tax
reached
a
large
class
of
people
like
merchants
in
towns
who
were
not
landholders
on
this
account
it
had
a
decided
influence
in
making
them
desire
to
have
a
voice
in
the
national
council
or
parliament
as
it
began
to
be
called
in
this
reign
it
thus
helped
as
we
shall
see
later
on
to
prepare
for
a
very
important
change
in
that
body
the
first
tax
on
movable
or
personal
property
appears
to
have
been
levied
by
henry
ii
in
for
the
support
of
the
crusades
under
henry
iii
the
idea
began
to
become
general
that
no
class
should
be
taxed
without
their
consent
out
of
this
grew
the
representation
of
townspeople
in
parliament
henry
extravagance
when
henry
became
of
age
he
entered
upon
a
course
of
extravagant
expenditure
this
with
unwise
and
unsuccessful
wars
finally
piled
up
debts
to
the
amount
of
nearly
a
million
of
marks
or
in
modern
money
upwards
of
pounds
to
satisfy
the
clamors
of
his
creditors
he
mortgaged
the
jews
or
rather
the
right
of
extorting
money
from
them
to
his
brother
richard
he
also
violated
the
chaters
and
treaties
in
order
to
compel
those
who
benefited
from
them
to
purchase
their
reissue
on
the
birth
of
his
first
son
prince
edward
he
showed
himself
so
eager
for
congratulatory
gifts
that
one
of
the
nobles
present
at
court
said
heaven
gave
us
this
child
but
the
king
sells
him
to
us
his
church
building
still
not
all
of
the
king
extravagance
was
money
thrown
away
everywhere
on
the
continent
magnificent
churches
were
rising
the
heavy
and
somber
norman
architecture
with
its
round
arches
and
square
massive
towers
was
giving
place
to
the
more
graceful
gothic
style
with
its
pointed
arch
and
lofty
tapering
spire
the
king
shared
the
religious
enthusiasm
of
those
who
built
the
grand
cathedrals
of
salisbury
and
lincoln
he
himself
rebuilt
the
greater
part
of
westminster
abbey
as
it
now
stands
a
monument
so
glorious
ought
to
make
us
willing
to
overlook
some
faults
in
the
builder
yet
the
expense
and
taxation
incurred
in
erecting
the
great
minster
must
be
reckoned
among
the
causes
that
bred
discontent
and
led
to
civil
war
religious
reformation
the
friars
roger
bacon
while
this
movement
which
covered
the
land
with
religious
edifices
was
in
progress
religion
itself
was
undergoing
a
change
the
old
monastic
orders
had
grown
rich
indolent
and
corrupt
the
priests
had
ceased
to
do
missionary
work
at
this
period
a
reform
sprang
up
within
the
church
itself
on
the
continent
two
new
religious
orders
arose
calling
themselves
friars
or
brothers
they
first
came
to
england
in
these
brothers
bound
themselves
to
a
life
of
and
good
works
some
labored
in
the
outskirts
of
towns
among
the
poor
and
the
sick
and
called
them
to
hear
the
glad
tidings
of
the
teachings
of
christ
from
their
living
on
charity
they
came
to
be
known
as
beggin
friars
others
like
roger
bacon
at
oxford
took
an
important
part
in
education
and
endeavored
to
rouse
the
sluggish
monks
to
make
efforts
in
the
same
direction
bacon
experiments
in
physical
science
which
was
then
neglected
and
despiseed
got
him
the
reputation
of
being
a
magician
he
was
driven
into
exile
imprisoned
for
many
years
and
deprived
of
books
and
writing
materials
but
as
nothing
could
check
the
religious
fervor
of
his
mendicant
brothers
so
no
hardship
or
suffering
could
daunt
the
intellectual
enthusiasm
of
bacon
when
he
emerged
from
captivity
he
issued
his
great
book
entitled
an
inquiry
into
the
roots
of
knowledge
it
was
especially
devoted
to
mathematics
and
the
sciences
and
deserves
the
name
of
the
encyclopedia
fo
the
thirteenth
century
bacon
designated
this
book
by
the
name
of
opus
majus
or
greater
work
to
distinguish
it
from
a
later
summary
which
he
alled
his
opus
minus
or
smaller
work
the
mad
parliament
the
provisions
of
oxford
but
the
prodigal
expenditure
and
mismanagement
of
henry
kept
on
increasing
at
last
the
burden
of
taxation
became
too
great
to
bear
bad
harvests
had
caused
a
famine
and
multitudes
perished
even
in
london
confronted
by
these
evils
parliament
met
in
the
great
hall
at
westminster
many
of
the
barons
were
in
complete
armor
as
the
king
entered
there
was
an
ominous
clatter
of
swords
henry
looking
around
asked
timidly
am
i
a
prisoner
no
sire
answered
earl
bigod
but
we
must
have
reform
the
king
agreed
to
summon
a
parliament
to
meet
at
oxford
and
consider
what
should
be
done
the
enemies
of
this
assembly
nicknamed
it
the
mad
parliament
but
there
was
method
and
determination
in
its
madness
for
which
the
country
was
grateful
with
simon
de
montfort
the
king
at
their
head
they
drew
up
a
set
of
articles
called
the
provisions
of
oxford
to
which
henry
gave
an
unwilling
assent
these
provisions
practically
took
the
government
out
of
the
king
inefficient
hand
and
vested
it
in
the
control
of
three
committees
or
councils
see
summary
of
constitutional
history
in
the
appendix
x
renewal
of
the
great
charter
meanwhile
the
king
had
been
compelled
to
reaffirm
that
great
charter
which
his
father
had
unwillingly
granted
at
runnymede
standing
in
catherine
chapel
within
the
partially
finished
church
of
westminster
abbey
henry
holding
a
lighted
taper
in
his
hand
in
company
with
the
chief
men
of
the
realm
swore
to
observe
the
provisions
of
the
covenant
at
the
close
he
exclaimed
as
he
dashed
the
taper
on
the
pavement
while
all
present
repeated
the
words
and
the
action
so
go
out
with
smoke
and
stench
the
accursed
souls
of
those
who
break
or
pervert
this
charter
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
king
was
insincere
in
his
oath
but
unfortunately
his
piety
was
that
of
impulse
not
of
principle
the
compact
was
soon
broken
and
the
lnd
was
again
compelled
to
bear
the
burden
of
exorbitant
taxes
these
were
extorted
by
violence
partly
to
cover
henry
own
extravagance
but
also
to
swell
the
coffers
of
the
pope
who
had
promised
to
make
henry
son
prince
edward
ruler
over
sicily
growing
feeling
of
discontent
during
this
time
the
barons
were
daily
growing
more
mutinous
and
defiant
saying
that
they
would
rather
die
than
be
ruined
by
the
romans
as
they
called
the
papal
power
to
a
fresh
demand
for
money
earl
bigod
gave
a
flat
refusal
then
i
will
send
reapers
and
reap
your
field
for
you
cried
the
king
to
him
and
i
will
send
you
back
the
heads
of
your
reapers
retorted
the
angry
earl
it
was
evident
that
the
nobles
would
make
no
concession
the
same
spirit
was
abroad
which
at
an
earlier
date
made
the
parliament
of
merton
declare
when
asked
to
alter
the
customs
or
laws
of
the
country
to
suit
the
ordinances
of
the
church
of

we
will
not

if

without
a

that
is
the
law
his
subjects
ought
to
put
a

on

earl
simon
had
that
bridle
ready
or
rather
he
saw
clearly
where
to
get
it
the
battle
of
lewes
had
gone
against
henry
who
had
fallen
captive
to
de
montfort
by
virtue
of
the
power
he
now
possessed
the
earl
summoned
a
parliament
it
differed
from
all
previous
parliaments
in
the
fact
that
now
for
the
first
time
representatives
of
the
boroughs
or
principal
towns
were
called
to
london
to
join
the
earls
barons
and
clergy
in
their
deliberations
thus
in
the
winter
of
that
house
of
commons
or
legislative
assembly
of
the
people
as
distinguished
from
the
house
of
lords
originated
after
it
was
fully
and
finally
established
in
the
next
reign
it
sat
for
more
than
three
hundred
years
in
the
chapter
house
of
westmister
abbey
it
showed
that
at
last
those
who
had
neither
land
nor
rank
but
who
paid
taxes
on
personal
property
only
had
obtained
at
least
temporary
representation
in
parliament
the
building
where
the
governing
body
of
an
abbey
transacts
business
when
that
principle
should
be
fully
recognized
the
king
would
have
a
bridle
which
he
could
not
shake
off
henceforth
magna
carta
would
be
no
longer
a
dead
parchment
promise
of
reform
rolled
up
and
hidden
away
but
would
become
a
living
effective
truth
see
and
constitutional
summary
in
the
appendix
x
from
this
date
the
great
council
or
parliament
of
england
commenced
to
lose
its
exclusive
character
of
a
single
house
consisting
of
the
upper
classes
only
now
it
gave
promise
of
becoming
a
true
representative
body
standing
for
the
whole
nation
thus
de
montfort
began
or
at
least
tried
to
begin
what
president
lincoln
called
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
but
it
should
be
distinctly
understood
that
his
work
had
the
defects
of
a
first
attempt
and
that
it
did
not
last
for
in
the
first
place
de
montfort
failed
to
summon
all
who
were
entitled
to
have
seats
in
such
a
body
and
secondly
he
summoned
only
those
who
favored
his
policy
we
shall
see
that
the
honor
of
calling
the
first
full
and
free
parliament
was
reserved
for
edward
thirty
years
later
he
summoned
that
body
which
became
the
final
model
of
every
such
assembly
which
now
meets
whether
in
the
old
world
or
the
new
earl
simon
death
but
de
montfort
great
effort
soon
met
with
a
fatal
reaction
the

jeolous
of
his
power
fell
away
from
him
prince
edward
the

eldest

gathered
them
round
the

to
attack
and

who
had
humiliated
his

was
at

by
him
for

there
he
fell
he
was
buried
in

but
no

his
grave
exists

aisle
of

not
far
from

may
be
seen

emblazoned
arms
of

but
england
so
rich
in
effigies
of
her
great
men
so
faithful
too
in
her
remembrance
of
them
has
not
yet
set
up
in
the
vestibule
of
the
house
of
commons
among
the
statues
of
her
statesmen
the
image
of
him
who
took
the
first
actual
step
toward
founding
that
house
in
its
present
form
summary
henry
iii
reign
lasted
over
half
a
century
during
that
period
england
as
we
have
seen
was
not
standing
still
it
was
an
age
of
reform
in
religion
the
begging
friars
were
exhorting
men
to
better
lives
in
education
roger
bacon
and
other
devoted
scholars
were
laboring
to
broaden
knowledge
and
deepen
thought
in
political
affairs
the
people
now
first
obtained
a
place
in
parliament
their
victory
was
not
permanent
then
but
it
was
the
precursor
of
the
establishment
of
a
permanent
house
of
commons
which
was
to
come
in
the
next
reign
edward
i
edward
i
and
the
crusades
henry
son
prince
edward
was
in
the
east
fighting
the
battles
of
the
crusades
at
the
time
of
his
father
death
according
to
an
account
given
in
an
old
spanish
chronicle
an
enemy
attacked
him
with
a
poisoned
dagger
his
wife
eleanor
saved
his
life
by
heroically
sucking
the
poison
from
the
wound
edward
first
complete
or
model
parliament
many
years
after
his
return
to
england
edward
convened
a
parliament
to
which
representatives
of
all
classes
of
freemen
were
summoned
and
from
this
time
they
regularly
met
parliament
henceforth
consisted
of
two
houses
this
first
included
the
lords
and
clergy
the
second
comprised
the
commons
or
representation
of
the
common
people
it
thus
became
a
complete
image
of
the
nation
assembled
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
legislation
and
united
political
action
this
body
declared
that
all
previous
laws
should
be
impartially
executed
and
that
there
should
be
no
interference
with
elections
by
this
action
king
edward
showed
that
he
had
the
wisdom
to
adopt
and
perfect
the
example
his
conqueror
had
left
him
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
though
earl
simon
the
righteous
was
dead
his
reform
went
on
it
was
an
illustration
of
the
truth
that
while
god
buries
his
workers
he
carries
on
his
work
but
during
that
period
of
the
commonwealth
and

out
a

apartment
where
edward
second
son
was
born
years
afterward

created
him
the
first
prince
of
wales
the
welsh
had
vowed
that
they
would
never
accept
an
englishman
as
king
but
the
young
prince
was
a
native
of
the
soil
and
certainly
in
his
cradle
at
least
spoke
as
good
welsh
as
their
own
children
of

no
objection
therefore
could
be
made

by
this
happy
compromise

not

conquest
of
scotland
the
stone
of
scone
an
opportunity
now
presented
itself
for
edward
to
assert
his
power
in
scotland
two
claimants
both
of
norman
descent
had
come
forward
demanding
the
crown
one
was
john
baliol
the
other
robert
bruce
an
ancestor
of
the
famous
scottish
king
and
general
of
that
name
who
will
come
prominently
forward
in
the
next
reign
he
decided
in
baliol
favor
but
insisted
before
doing
so
that
the
latter
should
acknowledge
the
overlordship
of
england
as
the
king
of
scotland
had
done
to
william
i
scotland
at
the
time
of
the
roman
conquest
of
britain
scotland
was
inhabited
by
a
celtic
race
nearly
akin
to
the
primitive
irish
and
more
distantly
so
to
the
britons
in
time
the
saxons
from
the
continent
invaded
the
country
and
settled
on
the
lowlands
of
the
east
driving
back
the
celts
to
the
western
highlands
later
many
english
emigrated
to
scotland
especially
at
the
time
of
the
norman
conquest
where
they
found
a
hearty
welcome
in
william
the
conqueror
compelled
the
scottish
king
to
acknowledge
him
as
overlord
and
eventually
so
many
norman
nobles
established
themselves
in
scotland
that
they
constituted
the
chief
landed
aristocracy
of
the
country
the
modern
scottish
nation
though
it
keeps
its
celtic
name
scotland
is
made
up
in
great
measure
of
inhabitants
of
english
descent
the
pure
scotch
being
confined
mostly
to
the
highlands
and
ranking
in
population
only
as
about
one
to
three
of
the
former
baliol
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
agreed
to
the
terms
but
shortly
after
formed
a
secret
alliance
with
france
against
edward
which
was
renewed
from
time
to
time
and
kept
up
between
the
two
countries
for
three
hundred
years
it
is
the
key
to
most
of
the
wars
in
which
england
was
involved
during
that
period
having
made
this
treaty
baliol
now
openly
renounced
his
allegiance
to
the
english
king
edward
at
once
organized
a
force
attacked
baliol
and
at
the
battle
of
dunbar
compelled
the
scottish
nobleman
to
acknowledge
him
as
ruler
at
the
abbey
of
scone
near
perth
the
english
seized
the
famous

demanded

large
sum
from
the
clergy
and
seized

the
barons
alarmed
at
these
arbitrary
measures
insisted
on
the
king
confirming

previous
charters

great
charter
this
confirmation
expressly
forbade

out
of

england
gained
the
one
thing
it
needed
to
give
the
finishing
touch
to
the
building
up
of
parliamentary

namely
a
solemn
acknowledgement
by

expulsion
of
the
jews
the
darkest
stain
on
edward
reign
was
his
treatment
of
the
jews
up
to
this
period
that
unfortunate
race
had
been
protected
by
the
kings
of
england
as
men
protect
the
cattle
which
they
fatten
for
slaughter
so
long
as
they
accumulated
money
and
so
long
as
the
sovereign
could
extort
from
them
whatever
portion
of
their
accumulations
he
saw
fit
to
demand
they
were
worth
guarding
a
time
had
now
come
when
the
populace
clamored
for
their
expulsion
from
the
island
on
the
ground
that
their
usury
and
rapacity
was
ruining
the
country
edward
yielded
to
the
clamor
and
first
stripping
the
jews
of
their
possessions
he
prepared
to
drive
them
into
exile
it
is
said
that
even
their
books
were
taken
from
them
and
given
to
the
libraries
of
oxford
thus
pillaged
they
were
forced
to
leave
the
realm
a
miserable
procession
numbering
some
sixteen
thousand
many
perished
on
the
way
and
so
few
ventured
to
return
that
for
three
centuries
and
a
half

came

death
of
queen
eleanor
shortly
after
this
event
queen
eleanor
died
the
king
showed
the
devoted
love
he
bore
her
in
the
beautiful
crosses
of
carved
stone
that
he
raised
to
her
memory
three
of
which
still
stand
these
were
erected
at
the
places
where
her
coffin
was
set
down
in
its
transit
from
grantham
in
lincolnshire
where
she
died
to
the
little
village

the

when

came
to
the
throne
was
far
from
settled
the
country
was
overrun
with
marauders
to
suppress
these
the
statute
of
winchester
made
the
inhabitants
of
every
district
punishable
by
fines
for
crimes
committed
within
their
limits
every
walled
town
had
to
close
its
gates
at
sunset
and
no
stranger
could
be
admitted
during
the
night
unless
some
citizen
would
be
responsible
for
him
in
addition
both
sides
of
the
main
roads
were
cleared
of
bushes
in
order
that
desperadoes
might
not
lie
in
wait
for
travelers
furthermore
every
citizen
was
required
to
keep
arms
and
armor
according
to
his
condition
in
life
and
to
join
in
the
pursuit
and
arrest
of
criminals
land
legislation
two
very
important
statutes
were
passed
during
this
reign
respecting
the
free
sale
or
transfer
of
land
these
laws
may
be
regarded
as
the
foundation
of
the
english
system
of
landed
property
they
completed
the
feudal
claim
to
the
soil
established
by
william
the
conqueror
they
are
known
as
the
second
statute
of
westminster
de
donis
or
entail
and
the
third
statute
of
westminster
quia
emptores
see
and
summary
of
constitutional
history
in
the
appendix
xi
the
effect
of
these
statutes
was
to
confine
the
great
estates
to
the
hands
of
their
owners
and
direct
descendants
or
when
land
changed
hands
to
keep
alive
the
claims
of
the
great
lords
or
the
crown
upon
it
these
laws
rendered
it
difficult
for
landholders
to
evade
their
feudal
duties
to
the
king
by
the
sale
or
subletting
of
estates
hence
while
they
often
built
up
the
strength
of
the
great
families
they
also
operated
to
increase
the
power
of
the
crown
at
the
very
time
when
the
growing
influence
of
parliament
and
the
people
was
beginning
to
act
as
a
check
upon
the
royal
authority
legislation
respecting
the
church
statute
of
mortmain
a
third
enactment
checked
the
undue
increase
of
church
property
through
gifts
and
bequests
the
clergy
had
become
owners
of
a
very
large
part
of
the
most
fertile
soil
of
the
realm
no
farms
herds
of
cattle
or
flocks
of
sheep
compared
with
theirs
these
lands
were
said
to
be
in
mortmain
or
dead
hands
since
the
church
being
a
corporation
never
let
go
its
hold
but
kept
its
property
with
the
tenacity
of
a
dead
man
grasp
the
clergy
constantly
strove
to
get
these
church
lands
exempted
from
furnishing
soldiers
or
paying
taxes
to
the
king
instead
of
men
or
money
they
offered
prayers
practically
the
crown
succeeded
from
time
to
time
in
compelling
them
to
do
considerably
more
than
this
but
seldom
without
a
violent
struggle
as
in
the
case
of
henry
ii
and
becket
on
account
of
these
exemptions
it
had
become
the
practice
with
many
persons
who
wished
to
escape
bearing
their
just
share
of
the
support
of
the
king
to
give
their
lands
to
the
church
and
then
receive
them
again
as
tenants
of
some
abbot
or
bishop
in
this
way
they
evaded
their
military
and
pecuniary
obligations
to
the
crown
to
put
a
stop
to
this
practice
and
so
make
all
landed
proprietors
do
their
part
the
statute
of
mortmain
was
passed
it
required
the
donor
of
an
estate
to
the
church
to
obtain
a
royal
license
which
it
is
perhaps
needless
to
say
was
not
readily
granted

peacefully
united
under
one
crown
by
the
accession
of
the
scottish
king
james
to
the
english
throne
the
new
favorites
the
king
made
prisoner
for
the
next
seven
years
the
earl
of
lancaster
had
his
own
way
in
england
during
this
time
edward
whose
weak
nature
needed
some
one
to
lean
on
had
got
two
new
favorites
hugh
despenser
and
his
son
they
were
men
of
more
character
than
gaveston
but
as
they
cared
chiefly
for
their
own
interests
they
incurred
the
hatred
of
the
baronage
the
king
wife
isabelle
of
france
now
turned
against
him
she
had
formerly
acted
as
a
peacemaker
but
from
this
time
she
did
all
in
her
power
to
make
trouble
roger
mortimer
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
barons
was
the
sworn
enemy
of
the
despensers
the
queen
had
formed
a
guilty
attachment
for
him
the
reign
of
mortimer
and
isabelle
was
a
reign
of
terror
together
they
plotted
the
ruin
of
edward
and
his
favorites
they
raised
a
force
seized
and
executed
the
despensers
and
then
took
the
king
prisoner
deposition
and
murder
of
the
king
having
locked
up
edward
in
kenilworth
castle
warwickshire
the
barons
now
resolved
ot
remove
him
from
the
throne
parliament
drew
up
articles
of
deposition
against
him
and
appointed
commissioners
to
demand
his
resignation
of
the
throne
when
they
went
to
the
castle
edward
appeared
before
them
clad
in
deep
mourning
presently
he
sank
fainting
to
the
floor
on
his
recovery
he
burst
into
a
fit
of
weeping
but
checking
himself
he
thanked
parliament
through
the
commissioners
for
having
chosen
his
eldest
son
edward
a
boy
of
fourteen
to
rule
over
the
nation
sir
william
trussel
then
stepped
forward
and
said
unto
thee
o
king
i
william
trussel
in
the
name
of
all
men
of
this
land
of
england
and
speaker
of
this
parliament
renounce
to
you
edward
the
homage
oath
of
allegiance
that
was
made
to
you
some
time
and
from
this
time
forth
i
defy
thee
and
deprive
thee
of
all
royal
power
and
i
shall
never
be
attendant
on
thee
as
king
from
this
time
then
sir
thomas
blount
steward
of
the
king
household
advanced
broke
his
staff
of
office
before
the
king
face
and
proclaimed
the
royal
household
dissolved
edward
was
soon
after
committed
to
berkeley
castle
in
gloucestershire
there
by
the
order
of
mortimer
with
the
connivance
of
queen
isabelle
the
of
france
who
acted
as
his
companion
in
iniquity
the
king
was
secretly
and
horribly
murdered
berkeley
castle
is
considered
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
feudal
architecture
now
remaining
in
england
over
the
stately
structure
still
floats
the
standard
borne
in
the
crusades
by
an
ancestor
of
the
present

berkeley
summary
the
lesson
of
edward
ii
career
is
found
in
its
culmination
other
sovereigns
had
been
guilty
of
misgovernment
others
had
put
unworthy
and
grasping
favorites
in
power
but
he
was
the
first
king
whom
parliament
had
deposed
by
that
act
it
became
evident
that
great
as
was
the
power
of
the
king
there
had
now
come
into
existence
a
greater
still

could
not
only
make

the

manufacture
the
reign
of
edward
iii
is
directly
connected
with
the
rise
of
a
flourishing
commerce
with
the
continent
in
the
early
ages
of
its
history
england
was
almost
wholly
an
agricultural
country
at
length
the
farmers
in
the
eastern
counties
began
to
turn
their
attention
to
wool
growing
they
exported
the
fleeces
which
were
considered
the
finest
in
the
world
to
the
flemish
cities
of
ghent
and
bruges
there
they
were
woven
into
cloth
and
returned
to
be
sold
in
the
english
market
for
as
an
old
writer
quaintly
remarks
the
english
people
at
that
time
knew
no
more
what
to
do
with
the
wool
than
the
sheep
on
whose
backs
it
grew
thomas
fuller
this
remark
applies
to
the
production
of
fine
woolens
only
the
english
had
long
manufactured
common
grades
of
woolen
cloth
to
some
extent
edward
wife
queen
philippa
was
a
native
of
a
french
province
adjoining
flanders
which
was
also
engaged
in
the
production
of
cloth
see
map
facing
p
she
used
her
influence
in
behalf
of
the
establishment
of
woolen
factories
at
norwich
and
other
towns
in
the
east
of
england
in
skilled
flemish
workmen
were
induced
to
come
over
and
by
their
help
england
successfully
laid
the
foundation
of
one
of
her
greatest
and
most
lucrative
industries
from
that
time
wool
was
considered
a
chief
source
of
the
national
wealth
later
that
the
fact
might
be
kept
constantly
in
mind
a
square
crimson
bag
filled
with
it
the
woolsack
became
and
still
continues
to
be
the
seat
of
the
lord
chancellor
in
the
house
of
lords
the
beginning
of
the
hundred
years
war
indirectly
this
trade
between
england
and
flanders
helped
to
bring
on
a
war
of
such
duration
that
it
received
the
name
of
the
hundred
war
flanders
was
at
that
time
a
dependency
of
france
see
map
facing
but
its
great
commercial
towns
were
rapidly
rising
in
power
and
were
restive
and
rebellious
under
the
exactions
and
extortion
of
their
feudal
master
count
louis
their
business
interests
bound
them
strongly
to
england
and
they
were
anxious
to
form
an
alliance
with
edward
against
philip
vi
of
france
who
was
determined
to
bring
the
flemish
cities
into
absolute
subjection
philip
was
by
no
means
unwilling
to
begin
hostilities
with
england
he
had
long
looked
with
a
greedy
eye
on
the
tract
of
country
south
of
the
loire
which
remained
in
possession
of
the
english
kings
and
only
wanted
a
pretext
for
annexing
through
his
alliance
with
scotland
he
threatened
to
attack

with
the
exception

at

period

which
was

part
of
it
see

p
edward
remonstrated
in
vain
against
these
outrages
at
length
having
concluded
an
alliance
with
ghent
the
chief
flemish
city
he
boldly
claimed
the
crown
of
france
as
his
lawful
right
and
followed
the
demand
with
a
declaration
of
war
edward
based
his
claim
on
the
fact
that
through
his
mother
isabelle
he
was
nephew
to
the
late
french
king
charles
iv
whereas
the
reigning
monarch
was
only
cousin
of
that
monarch
to
this
the
french
replied
that
since
their
law
excluded
women
from
the
throne
edward
claim
was
worthless
because
he
could
not
inherit
the
crown
of

battle
of

for

eight
years
fighting
between
the
two
countries
was
going
on
pretty
constantly
on
both
land
and
sea
but
without
decisive
results
edward
was
pressed
for
money
and
had
to
resort
to
all
sorts
of
expedients
to
get
it
even
to
pawning
his
own
and
the
crown
to
raise
enough
to
pay
his

at

he
succeeded
in
equipping
a
strong
force
and
with
his
son
prince
edward
a
lad
of
fifteen
invaded
normandy
his
plan
seems
to
have
been
to
attack
the
french
army
in
the
south
of
france
but
after
landing
he
changed
his
mind
and
determined
to
ravage

edward
halted
on
a
little
rise
of
ground
not
far
from
or
cressy
near
the
coast
on
the
way
to
calais
there
a
desperate
battle
took
place
see
map
facing
p
the
french
had
the
larger
force
but
edward
the
better
position
philip
army
included
a
number
of
hired
genoese
crossbowmen
on
whom
he
placed
great
dependence
but
a
thunderstorm
had
wet
their
bowstrings
which
rendered
them
nearly
useless
and
as
they
advanced
toward
the
english
the
afternoon
sun
shone
so
brightly
in
their
eyes
that
they
could
not
take
accurate
aim
the
english
archers
on
the
other
hand
had
kept
their
long
bows
in
their
cases
so
that
the
strings
were
dry
and
ready
for
action
in
the
midst
of
the
fight
the
earl
of
warwick
who
was
hard
pressed
by
the
enemy
became
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
young
king
edward
he
sent
to
the
king
asking
reenforcements
is
my
son
killed
asked
the
king
no
sire
please
god
is
he
wounded
no
sire
is
he
thrown
to
the
ground
no
sire
but
he
is
in
great
danger
then
said
the
king
i
shall
send
no
aid
let
the
boy
win
his
spurs
for
i
wish
if
god
so
order
it
that
the
honor
of
victory
shall
be
his
the
father
wish
was
gratified
from
that
time
the
black
prince
as
the
french
called
prince
edward
from
the
color
of
his
armor
became
a
name
renowned
throughout
europe
spurs
were
the
especial
badge
of
knighthood
it
was
expected
of
every
one
who
attained
that
honor
that
he
should
do
some
deed
of
valor
this
was
called
winning
his
spurs
the
battle
however
was
gained
not
by
his
bravery
or
that
of
the
nobles
who
supported
him
but
by
the
sturdy
english
yeomen
armed
with
their
long
bows
with
these
weapons
they
shot
their
keen
white
arrows
so
thick
and
fast
and
with
such
deadly
aim
that
a
writer
who
was
present
on
the
field
compared
them
to
a
shower
of
snow
it
was
that
fatal
snowstorm
which
won
the
day
we
shall
see
presently
that
the
great
importance
of
this
victory
to
the
english
turned
on
the
fact
that
by
it
king
edward
was
able
to
move
on
calais
and
secure
possession
of
that
port
the
english
yeomen
or
country
people
excelled
in
the
use
of
the
long
bow
they
probably
learned
its
value
from
their
norman
conquerors
who
empoyed
it
with
great
effect
at
the
battle
of
hastings
writing
at
a
much
later
period
bishop
latimer
said
in
my
tyme
my
poore
father
was
as
diligent
to
teach
me
to
shote
as
to
learne
anye
other
thynge
taught
me
how
to
drawe
how
to
laye
my
bodye
in
my
bowe
and
not
to
drawe
wyth
strength
of
armes
as
other
nacions
do
but
wyth
strength
of
the
bodye
i
had
bowes
broughte
me
accordyng
to
my
age
and
strength
as
i
encreased
in
them
so
my
bowes
were
made
bigger
and
bigger
for
men
shal
neuer
shot
well
excepte
they
be
broughte
up
in
it
the
advantage
of
this
weapon
over
the
steel
crossbow
used
by
the
genoese
lay
in
the
fact
that
it
could
be
discharged
much
more
rapidly
the
latter
being
a
cumbrous
affair
which
had
to
be
wound
up
with
a
crank
for
each
shot
hence
the
english
long
bow
was
to
that
age
what
the
revolver
is
to
ours
it
sent
an
arrow
with
such
force
that
only
the
best
armor
could
withstand
it
the
french
peasantry
at
that
period
had
no
skill
with
this
weapon
and
about
the
only
part
they
took
in
a
battle
was
to
stab
horses
and
despatch
wounded
men

of

chivalry
at
small
cannon
appear
to
have
been
used
for
the
first
time
in
field
warfare
though
gunpowder
was
probably
known
to
the
english
friar
roger
bacon
a
hundred
years
before
the
object
of
the
cannon
was
to
frighten
and
annoy
the
horses
of
the
french
cavalry
they
were
laughed
at
as
ingenious
toys
but
in
the
course
of
the
next
two
centuries
those
toys
revolutionized
warfare
and
made
the
knight
little
more
than
a
tradition
and
a
name
in
its
day
however
knighthood
did
the
world
a
good
service
chivalry
aimed
to
make
the
profession
of
arms
a
noble
instead
of
a
brutal
calling
it
gave
it
somewhat
of
a
religious
character
it
taught
the
warrior
the
worth
of
honor
truthfulness
and
courtesy
as
well
as
valor
qualities
which
still
survive
in
the
best
type
of
the
modern
gentleman
we
owe
therefore
no
small
debt
to
that
military
brotherhood
of
the
past

may
join
the
english
poet
in
his
epitaph

takes
calais
king
edward
now
marched
against
calais
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
take
the
place
first
because
it
was
a
favorite
resort
of
desperate
pirates
secondly
because
such
a
fortified
port
on
the
strait
of
dover
within
sight
of
the
chalk
cliffs
of
england
would
give
him
at
all
times
an
open
doorway
into
france
after
besieging
it
for
nearly
a
year
the
garrison
was
starved
into
submission
and
prepared
to
open
the
gates
edward
was
so
exasperated
with
the
stubborn
resistance
the
town
had
made
that
he
resolved
to
put
the
entire
population
to
the
sword
but
at
last
he
consented
to
spare
them
on
condition
that
six
of
the
chief
men
should
give
themselves
up
to
be
hanged
a
meeting
was
called
and

the
wealthiest
citizen
of
the
place
volunteered
with
five
others
to
go
forth
and
die
bareheaded
barefooted
with
halters
round
their
necks
they
silently
went
out
carrying
the
keys
of
the
city
when
they
appeared
before
the
english
king
he
ordered
the
executioner
who
was
standing
by
to
seize
them
and
carry
out
the
sentence
forthwith
but
queen
philippa
who
had
accompanied
her
husband
now
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
and
with
tears
begged
that
they
might
be
forgiven
for
a
long
time
edward
was
inexorable
but
finally
unable
to
resist
her
entreaties
he
granted
her
request
and
the
men
who
had
dared
to
face
death
for
others
found
life
both
for
themselves
and
their
fellow
citizens
calais
now
became
an
english
town
and
the
english
kept
it
for
more
than
two

believing

fell
on

edward
renounced
his
claim
to
normandy
and

notwithstanding

fact
all

the
great
gain
to
england
from
these
wars
was
not
in
the
territory
conquered
but
in
the
new
feeling
of
unity
they
aroused
among
all
classes
the
memory
of
the
brave
deeds
achieved
in
those
fierce
contests
on

the
glory
of
the
black
prince
whose
rusted
helmet
and
dented
shield
still
hang

one
with
the
glory
of

whatever
lingering
feeling
of
jealousy

hatred
had
remained

melted
away

that

shortly

out
in

which
swept
over
the
country
destroying
upwards
of
half
the
population
the
disease
which
was
known
as
the
black
death
had
already
traversed

where
it
had
proved
equally
fatal
how

persons
said

period
breakfasted
with

friends
in

morning
who
when

came
supped
with
their
ancestors
in

and

cities

mortality
was
so
great
that
the
living
were
hardly
able
to

dead

that

came
to

labor
after
the
pestilence
had
subsided
it
was
impossible
to
find
laborers
enough
to
till
the
soil
and
shear
the
sheep
those
who
were
free
now
demanded
higher
wages
while
the
villeins
or
serfs
and
slaves
left
their
masters
and
roamed
about
the
country
asking
for
pay
for
their
work
like
freemen
it
was
a
general
agricultural
strike
which
lasted
over
thirty
years
it
marks
the
beginning
of
that
contest
between
capital
and
labor
which
had
such
an
important
influence
on
the
next
reign
and
which
after
a
lapse
of
more
than
five
hundred
years
is
not
yet
satisfactorily
adjusted
parliament
endeavored
to
restore
order
it
passed
laws
forbidding
any
freeman
to
ask
more
for
a
day
work
than
before
the
plague
it
gave
the
master
the
right
to
punish
a
serf
who
persisted
in
running
away
by
branding
him
on
the
forehead
with
the
letter
f
for
fugitive
but
legislation
was
in
vain
the
movement
had
begun
and
statutes
of
parliament
could
no
more
stop
it
than
they
could
stop
the
rolling
of
the
ocean
tide
it
continued
to
go
on

it
reached
its
climax
in
the
peasant
insurrection
led
by

under
edward
successor
richard
ii
beginning
of
english
literature
during
edward
reign
the
first
work
in
english
prose
may
have
been
written
it
was
a
volume
of
travels
by
sir
john
mandeville
who
had
journeyed
in
the
east
for
over
thirty
years
on
his
return
he
wrote
an
account
of
what
he
had
heard
and
seen
first
in
latin
that
the
learned
might
read
it
next
in
french
that
the
nobles
might
read
it
and
lastly
he
or
some
unknown
person
translated
it
into
english
for
the
common
people
he
dedicated
the
work
to
the
king
perhaps
the
most
interesting
and
wonderful
thing
in
it
was
the
statement
of
his
belief
that
the
world
is
a
globe
and
that
a
ship
may
sail
round
it
above
and
beneath
an
assertion
which
probably
seemed
to
many
who
read
it
then
as
less
credible
than
any
of
the
marvelous
stories
in
which
his
book
abounds
william
langland
was
writing
rude
verses
about
his
vision
of
piers
the
plowman
contrasting
the
wealth
and
woe
of
the
world
and
so
helping
forward
that
democratic
outbreak
which
was
soon
to
take
place
among
those
who
knew
the
woe
and
wanted
the
wealth
john
wycliffe
a
lecturer
at
oxford
attacked
the
rich
and
indolent
churchmen
in
a
series
of
tracts
and
sermons

fought

attempted
to
carry
through

reforms
it
impeached
for
the
first
time
in

history
certain
prominent
men
for
fraud
but
in
the
end
its
work
failed
for
want
of
a
leader
the
king
last
days
were
far
from
happy
his
son
the
black
prince
had
died
and
edward
fell
entirely
into
the
hands
of
selfish
favorites
and
ambitious
schemers
like
john
of
gaunt
duke
of
lancaster
perhaps
the
worst
one
of
this
corrupt
ring
was
a
woman
named
alice
perrers
who
after
queen
philippa
was
no
more
got
almost
absolute
control
of
the
king
she
stayed
with
him
until
his
last
sickness
when
his
eyes
began
to
glaze
in
death
she
plucked
the
rings
from
his
unresisting
hands
and
fled
from

but
john

speedily
got
the
control

he
was
an
unprincipled
man
who
wasted
the

was
especially
hated
by

times

again
broken

was
rapidly
accumulating
the
new
tax
the
tyler
and
ball
insurrection
in
order
to
raise
money
the
government
resolved
to
levy
a
new
form
of
tax
a
poll
or
head
tax
which
had
been
tried
on
a
small
scale
during
the
last
year
of
the
previous
reign
the
apttempt
had
been
made
to
assess
it
on
all
classes
from
laborers
to
lords
the
imposition
was
now
renewed
in
a
much
more
oppressive
form
not
only
every
laborer
but
every
member
of
a
laborer
family
above
the
age
of
fifteen
was
required
to
pay
what
twould
be
eequal
to
the
wages
of
an
man
for
at
least
several
days
work
the
tax
on
laborers
and
their
families
varied
from
four
to
twelve
pence
each
the
assessor
having
instructions
to
collect
the
latter
sum
if
possible
the
wages
of
a
day
laborer
were
then
about
a
penny
so
that
the
smallest
tax
for
a
family
of
three
would
represent
the
entire
pay
for
nearly
a
fortnight
labor
see

in

fourteenth

we
have
already
seen
that
owing
to
the
ravages
of
the
black
death
and
the
strikes
which
followed
the
country
was
on
the
verge
of
revolt
this
new
tax
was
the
spark
that
caused
the
explosion
the
money
was
roughly
demanded
in
every
poor
man
cottage
and
its
collection
caused
the
greatest
distress
in
attempting
to
enforce
payment
a
brutal
collector
shamefully
insulted
the
young
daughter
of
a
workman
named
wat

the
indignant
father
hearing
the
cry
for

snatched
up
a

the

to
shake
off

the
great
uprising
of
the
laboring
class
twenty
years
before
there
had
been
similar
outbreaks
in
flanders
and
in
france
this
therefore
was
not
an
isolated
instance
of
insurrection
but
rather
part
of
a
general
uprising
the
rebellion
begun
by
tyler
and
ball
spread
through
the
southern
and
eastern
counties
of
england
taking
different
forms
in
different
districts
it
was
violent
in
albans
where
the
peasants
and
farm
laborers
generally
rose
against
the
exactions
of
the
abbot
but
it
reached
its
greatest
height
in
london
for
three
weeks
the
mob
held
possession
of
the
capital
they
pillaged
and
then
burned
john
of

they
seized
and
beheaded
the
lord
chancellor
and
the
chief
collector
of
the
odious
poll
tax
they
destroyed
all
the
law
papers
they
could
lay
hands
on
and
ended
by
murdering
a
number
of
lawyers
for
the
rioters
believed
that
the
members
of

profession
spent
their

forging

chains
which
held
the
laboring
class
in
subjection

end
of
the
rebellion
the
insurrectionists
demanded
of
the
king
that
villeinage
should
be
abolished
and
that
the
rent
of
agricultural
lands
should
be
fixed
by
parliament
at
a
uniform
rate
in

they
also
insisted
that

should
be

that

unconditional
pardon
should
be

struck
down
wat
tyler
with
his
dagger
and
with
his
death
the
whole
movement
collapsed
almost
as
suddenly
as
it
arose
parliament
now
began
a
series
of
merciless
executions
and
refused
to
consider
any
of
the
claims
to
which
richard
had
shown
a
disposition
to
listen
in
their
punishment
of
the
rebels
the

the
lords
in
severity
few
showing
any
sympathy
with
the
efforts
of
the
peasants
to
obtain
their
freedom
from
feudal
bondage
the
uprising
however
was
not
in
vain
for
by
it
the
old
restrictions
were
in
some
degree
loosened
so
that
in
the
course
of
the
next
century
and
a
half
villeinage
was
gradually
abolished
and
the
english
laborer
acquired
that
greatest
yet
most
perilous
of
all
rights
the
complete
ownership
of
himself
in
scotland
villeinage
lasted
much
longer
and
as
late
as
in
the
reign
of
george
iii
men
working
in
coal
and
salt
mines
were
held
in
a
species
of
slavery
which
was
finally
abolished
the
following
year
so
long
as
he
was
a
serf
the
peasant
could
claim
assistance
from
his
master
in
sickness
and
old
age
in
attaining
independence
he
had
to
risk
the
danger
of
pauperism
which
began
with
it
this
possibility
being
part
of
the
price
which
man
must
everywhere
pay
for
the
inestimable
privilege
of
freedom
the
new
movement
in
literature
the
same
spirit
which
demanded
emancipation
on
the
part
of
the
working
classes
showed
itself
in
literature
we
have
already
seen
how
in
the
previous
reign
langland
in
his
poem
of
piers
plowman
gave
bold
utterance
to
the
growing
discontent
of
the
times
in
his
declaration
that
the
rich
and
great
destroyed
the
poor
in
a
different
spirit
chaucer
the
morning
star
of
english
song
now
began
to
write
his
canterbury
tales
a
series
of
stories
in
verse
supposed
to
be
told
by
a
merry
band
of
pilgrims
on
their
way
from
the
tabard
inn
in
southwark
london
to
the
shrine
of
thomas
becket
in
canterbury
there
is
little
of
langland
complaint
in
chaucer
for
he
was
generally
a
favorite
at
court
seeing
mainly
the
bright
side
of
life
and
sure
of
his
yearly
allowance
of
money
and
daily
pitcher
of
wine
from
the
royal
bounty
yet
with
all
his
mirth
there
is
a
vein
of
playful
satire
in
his
description
of
men
and
things
his
pictures
of
jolly
monks
and
churchmen
with
his
lines
addressed
to
his
purse
as
his
saviour
as
down
in
this
world
here
show
that
he
saw
beneath
the
surface
of
things
he
too
was
thinking
at
least
at
times
of
the
manifold
evils
of
poverty
and
of
that
danger
springing
from
religious
indifference
which
poor
langland
had
taken
so
much
to
heart

but
the
real
reformer
of
that
day
was
john
wycliffe
rector
of
lutterworth
in

and
lecturer
at
oxford
he
boldly
attacked
the
religious
and
the
political
corruption
of
the
age
the
begging
friars
who
had
once
done
such
good
work
had
now

rich
and
lazy
to
be
of
further
use
wycliffe
whose
emaciated
form
concealed
an
unconquerable
energy
and
dauntless
courage
organized
a
new
band
of
brothers
known
as
poor
priests
they
took
up
and
pushed
forward
the
reforms
the
friars
had
dropped

it
and
many
priests
were
almost
as
ignorant
of
its
contents
to
carry
on
the
revival
which
he
had
begun
wycliffe
now
began
to
translate
the
entire
scriptures
into
english
when
the
great
work
was
finished
it
was
copied
and
circulated
by
the
poor
priests
but
the
cost
of
such
a
book
in
manuscript
for
the
printing
press
had
not
yet
come
into
existence
was
so
high
that
only
the
rich
could
buy
the
complete
volume
many
however
who
had
no
money
would
give
a
load
of
farm
produce
for
a
few
favorite
chapters
in
this
way
wycliffe
bible
was
spread
throughout
the
country
among
all
classes
later
when
persecution
began
men
hid
these
precious
copies
and
read
them
with
locked
doors
at
night
or
met
in
the
forests
to
hear
them
expounded
by
preachers
who
went
about
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
these
things
led
wycliffe
enemies
to
complain
that
common
men
and
women
who
could
read
were
better
acquainted
with
the
scriptures
than
the
most
learned
and
intelligent
of
the
clergy
the
lollards
wycliffe
remains
burned
the
followers
of
wycliffe
were
nicknamed
lollards
a
word
of
uncertain
meaning
but
apparantly
used
as
an
expression
of
contempt
from
having
been
religious
reformers
denouncing
the
wealth
and
greed
of
a
corrupt
church
they
seem
in
some
cases
to
have
degenerated
into
socialists
or
communists
this
latter
class
demanded
like
john
ball
who
may
have
been
one
of
their
number
that
all
property
should
be
equally
divided
and
that
all
rank
should
be
abolished
this
fact
should
be
borne
in
mind
with
reference
to
the
subsequent
efforts
made
by
the
government
to
suppress
the
movement
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
the
lollards
were
heretics
in
the
judgment
of
many
moderate
men
they
were
destructionists
and
anarchists
as
unreasonable
and
as
dangerous
as
the
dynamiters

more

forty
years

wycliffe
death
a

to
be
dug
up

his
influence

not

permeated
england
but
had
passed
to
the

was
preparing
the
way
for
that
greater
movement
which

was
to
inaugurate
in
the
sixteenth

this

the

whether

not
he
at

acted
like

another
authority
defends
him
saying
that
richard
was
not
a
despot

this

marks
the
beginning
of
a

it
proved
of
the
highest
value
henceforth
in
securing
good
government
it
was
confirmed

by

of

and

of
especial
importance

of
the

in
under
henry

through
the
influence
of
simon

montfort
two
representatives
from
each
city
and
borough
or
town
together
with
two
knights
of
the
shire
or
country
gentlemen
were
summoned
to
meet
with
the
lords
and
clergy
in
the
great
council
or
parliament
but
the
house
of
commons
did
not
become
a
permanent
body
until
the
model
parliament
of
was
summoned
from
that
time
the
body
of
the
people
began
to
have
a
permanent
voice
in
making
the
laws
later
in
the
period
the
knights
of
the
shire
joined
the
representatives
from
the
towns
in
forming
a
distinct
body
in
parliament
sitting
by
themselves
under
the
name
of
the
house
of

they
asserted
their
right
to
assent
to

and
they
exercised
hte
right
of

the

later
under

barons
were

this
is
the
modern
method
of
raising
a
subject
the
poet
alfred
tennyson
to
the
peerage
it
marks
the
fact
that
from
the
thirteenth
century
the
ownership
of
land
was
no
longer
considered
a
necessary
condition
of
nobility
and
that
the
peerage
was
gradually
developing
into
the
five
degrees
which
were
completed
in
in
the
following
ascending
order
barons

dukes
land
laws
during
this
period
important
laws
de
donis
or
entail
and
quia
emptores
respecting
land
were
passed
which
had
the
effect
of
keeping
estates
in
families
and
also
of
preventing
their
possessors
from
evading
their
feudal
duties
to
the
king
at
the
same
time
the
statute
of
mortmain
a
restriction
on
the
acquisition
of
land
by
the
church
which
was
exempt
from
paying
certain
feudal
dues
was
imposed
to
prevent
the

from
being
diminished

power
during
the

period

of
ordinances
consisting
mainly
of
the
decisions
of
church
councils
and
popes
into
england
with
the
view
of
making
it
supreme
but
the
parliament
of
merton
refused
to
accept
it
saying
we
will
not
change
the
laws
of
england
the
statute
of
mortmain
was
also
passed
and
other
measures
statutes
of
provisors
and
statute
of
praemunire
which
forbade
the
pope
from
taking
the
appointment
of
bishops
and
other
ecclesiastics
out
of
the
hands
of
the
clergy
and
which
prohibited
any
appeal
from
the
king
court
to
the
papal
court
furthermore
many
hundreds
of
parishes
formerly
filled
by
foreigners
who
could
not
speak
english
were
now
given
to
native
priests
and
the
sending
of
money
out
of
the
country
to
support
foreign
ecclesiastics
was
in
great
measure
stopped
during
the
crusades
two
religious
military
orders
had
been
established
called
the
knights
hospitalers
and
the
knights
templars
the
object
of
the
former
was
originally
to
provide
entertainment
for
pilgrims
going
to
jerusalem
that
of
the
latter
to
protect
them
both
had
extensive
possessions
in
england
in
the
order
of
templars
was
broken
up
on
a
charge
of
heresy
and
evil
life
and
their
property
in

given
to
the

this
was
followed
by
attack
on
religious
abuses
by
his
complete
translation
of
the
bible
with
the
revival
carried
on
by
the
poor
priests
and
by
the
rise
of
the
lollards
eventually
severe
laws
were
passed
against
the
lollards
partly
because
of
their
heretical
opinions
and
partly
because
they
became
in
a
measure
identified
with
socialistic
and
communistic
efforts
to
destroy

joined

so
as
to
fit

this
when
it
was
finally
perfected
was
called
plate

and
was
both
heavier
and
stronger
than
mail
with
the
introduction
of
plate
armor
and
the
closed
helmet
it
became
the
custom
for
each
knight
to
wear
a
device
called
a
crest
on
his
helmet
and
also
to
have
one
called
a
coat
of
arms
because
originally
worn
on
a
loose
coat
over
the
armor
the
coat
of
arms
served
to
distinguish
the
wearer
from
the
others
and
was
of
practical
use
not
only
to
the
followers
of
a
great
lord
who
thus
knew
him
at
a
glance
but
it
served
in
time
of
battle
to
prevent
the
confusion
of
friend
and
foe
eventually
coats
of
arms
became
hereditary
and
the
descent
and
to
some
extent
the
history
of
a
family
can
be
traced
by
them

way

may
often
prove
helpful
in
gaining
knowledge

the
profession
of
arms
was
regulated
by
certain
rules
by
which
each
knight
solemnly
bound
himself
to
serve
the
cause
of
religion
and
the
king
and
to
be

and
courteous

those
of
his

rank
to
protect

under

did
some
glorious
deed
the
chief
amusement
of
the
nobles

knights
was
the
tournament
a
mock
combat
fought
on
horseback
in
full
armor
which
sometimes
ended
in

a

was
roused

at

a

spirit
cultivated

had
a
strong
influence
in

based
largely
on
earlier

and
covering
the
period
from

it
is
a
work
of
much
value

to

men

for

many

were
afraid
to
lend
him
what
he
required
in
the

took
a
very
decisive
step
it

obtained
first
the

right
of
originating
all
money
bills
or
in

words
of
making
all
grants
of
money
which
the
king
asked
for
this
practically
gave
the
people
the
control
of
the
nation
purse
secondly
the
commons
demanded
and
obtained
from
the
king
that
he
should
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
right
to
deliberate
what
action
they
should
take
in
regard
to
making
such
grants
of
money
besides
being
held
in
check
by
the

the
king
was
hampered
by
a
council
whose
advice
he
had
pledged
himself
to
follow
for
these
reasons
henry
position
was
in
every
way
precarious
this
right
of
originating

bills
had
been
claimed
as
early
as
the
reign
of
richard

but
was
not
fully
and
formally
recognized

in

to

difficulties
he
had
made
an
enemy
of

he
had
refused

a

had
got

him
the

william

a

clergyman
was
the

suffered

had

they
could

the

indeed
were
still
cast

of

the

seems
to
have
thought

according

an
old

declared
that

was

report
now
began

it
was
said
that
richard

had
been
seen
in

and
that
he
was
preparing
to
claim
the
throne
which
henry

had
taken
from

silence

seditious
rumor
the

it
is
said
exhumed
richard
body
from
its
grave
in
the
little
village
of
langley
hertfordshire
at
any
rate
a
dead
body
reputed
to
be
richard
was
brought
to

and
propped
up
in
a
chair
so
that
all
might
see
it
in

manner
the
king
and
his
court
escorted
the
corpse
in
solemn
procession
to
westminster
abbey
where
it
was
reinterred
among
the
tombs
of
the
english
sovereigns
with
it
he
buried
once
for
all
the
troublesome
falsehood
which
had
kept
up
insurrection
and
had
made
the
deposed
king
more
feared
after
death
than
he
had
ever
been
during

with

to
divert
the
attention
of
the
nation
from
dangerous
home
questions
likely
to
cause
new
plots
and
fresh
revolts
henry
now
determined
to
act
on
his
father
dying
counsel
and
pick
a
foreign
quarrel
the
old
grudge
against
france
which
began
with
the
feuds
of
duke
william
of
normandy
before
he
conquered
england
made
a
war
with
that
country
always
popular
at
this
period
the
french
were
divided
into
fierce
parties
that
hated
each
other
even
more
if
possible
than
they
hated
the
english
this
of
course
greatly
increased
the
chances
of
henry
success
as
he
might
form
an
alliance
with
one
of
these
factions
the
king
believed
it
a
good
opportunity
to
get
three
things
he
wanted
a
wife
a
fortune
and
the
french
crown
the
king
of
france
and
his
most
powerful
rival
the
duke
of
burgundy
had
each
a
daughter
to
make
sure
of
one
of
them
henry
secretly
proposed
to
both
after
long
and
fruitless
negotiations
the
french
king
declined
to
grant
the
enormous
dowry
which
the
english
king
demanded
the
latter
gladly
interpreted
this
refusal
as
equivalent
to
a
declaration
of
war
the
great
battle
of
agincourt
henry
set
to
work
with
vigor
raised
an
army
and
invaded
france
he
besieged
harfleur
near
the
mouth
of
the
seine
and
took
it
but
his
army
suffered
so
much
from
sickness
that
after
leaving
a
garrison
in
the
place
he
resolved
to
move
north
to
the
walled
city
of
calais
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
english
had
captured
that
city
nearly
seventy
years
before
and
henry
intended
to
wait
there
for
reenforcements
see

facing
p
after
a
long
and
perilous
march
he
reached
a
little
village
about
midway
between
and
calais
there
he
encountered
the
enemy
in
great
force
both
sides
prepared
for
battle
the
french
had
fifty
thousand
troops
to
henry
seven
or
eight
thousand
but
the
latter
had
that
determination
which

victories
he
said
to
one
of

nobles
who
regretted
that
he
had
not
a
larger

poverty

and
wealth

one
cause
of

weakness
of

was
its
poverty
the
revenues
of
the
crown
had
been
greatly
diminished
by
gifts

the

was
obliged
to
pawn

plate
from

the

lords

out

lived
in

splendor
this
earl
it
is

had
at

upwards
of
thirty
thousand
men

a

erect
holding

staff
embroidered

was

the
feudal
system
having
now
so
far
decayed
that

by
the
plunder
of

cities
thirdly
by
ransoms
obtained
from

taken
prisoners
backed
by

forces
it
was
easy
for
the
earl
and
other
powerful
lords
to
overawe
kings
parliaments
and
courts
between
the
heads

great
houses
quarrels
were
constantly
breaking

the
safety
of

was
endanged
by
these
feuds
which
became
more
and
more
violent
and
often
ended
in
bloodshed
and
murer
disfranchisement
of
the
common
people
with
the
growth
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
nobles
there
was
also
imposed
for
the
first
time
a
restriction
on
the
right
of
the
people
to
vote
for
members
of

up
to
this
period
all
freemen
might
take
part
in
the
election
of
representatives
chosen
by
the
counties
to
sit
in
the
house
of

a
law
was
now
passed
forbidding
any
one
to
vote
at
these
elections
unless
he
was
a
resident
of
the
county
and
possessed
of
landed
property
yielding
an
annual
income
of
forty
shillings
subsequently
it
was
further
enacted
that
no
county
candidate
should
be
eligible
unless
he
was
a
man
of
means
and
social
standing
the
income
required
by
the
statute
was
forty
shillings
which
says

we
may
fairly
call

rebellion
a
formidable
rebellion
broke
out
in
kent
then
as
now
one
of
the
most
independent
and
democratic
counties
in
england
the
leader
was
jack
cade
who
called
himself
by
the
popular
name
of
mortimer
note
and
he
claimed
to
be
cousin
to
richard
duke
of
york
a
nephew
of
that
edmund
mortimer
now
dead
whom
henry
iv
had
unjustly
deprived
of
his
succession
to
the
crown
cade
who
was
a
mere
adventurer
was
quite
likely
used
as
a
tool
by
plotters
much
higher
than
himself
by
putting
him
forward
they
could
judge
whether
the
country
was
ready
for
a
revolution
and
change
of
sovereigns
wat
tyler
rebellion
seventy
years
before
was
almost
purely
social
in
its
character
having
for
its
object
the
emancipation
of
the
enslaved
laboring
classes
cade
insurrection
was
on
the
contrary
almost
wholly
political
his
chief
complaint
was
that
the
people
were
not
allowed
their
free
choice
in
the
election
of
representatives
but
were
forced
by
the
nobility
to
choose
candidates
they
did
not
want
other
grievances
for
which
reform
was
demanded
were
excessive
taxastion
and
the
rapacity
of
the
evil
counselors
who
controlled
the
king
cade
entered
london
with
a
body
of
twenty
thousand
men
under
strict
discipline
many
of
the
citizens
sympathized
with
cade
projects
of
reform
and
were
ready
to
give
him
a
welcome
he
took
formal
possession
of
the
place
by
striking
his
sword
on
london
stone
a
roman
monument
still
standing
which
then
marked
the
center
of
the
ancient
capital
saying
as
shakespeare
reports
him
now
is
mortimer
lord
of
this
city
after
three
days
of
riot
and
the
murder
of
the
king
treasurer
the
rebellion
came
to
an
end
through
a
general
pardon
cade
however
endeavored
to
raise
a
new
insurrection
in
the
south
but
was
shortly
after
captured
and
died
of
his
wounds

any
man
to
call

other
than

henry

part

scene
vi
it
is
noticeable
that
the
great
dramatist
expresses
no
sympathy
in
this
play
with
the
cause
of
the
people
in
fact
he
ridicules
cade
and
his
movement
in
the
same
spirit
he
does
not
mention
the
great
charter
in
his
king
john
while
in
his
richard
ii
he
passes
over
wat
tyler
without
a
word
perhaps
the
explanation
may
be
found
in
the
fact
that
shakespeare
lived
in
an
age
when
england
was
threatened
by
both
open
and
secret
enemies
the
need
of
his
time
was
a
strong
steady
hand
at
the
helm
it
was
no
season
for
reform
or
change
of
any
sort
on
this
account
he
may
have
thought
it
his
duty
to
be
silent
in
regard
to
democratic
risings
and
demands
in
the
past
note
wars
of
the
roses
the
real
significance
of
cade
insurrection
is
that
it
showed
the
widespread
feeling
of
discontent
caused
by
misgovernment
and
that
it
served
as
an
introduction
to
the
long
and
dreary
period
of
civil
strife
known
as
the
wars
of
the
roses
so
long
as
the
english
nobles
had
france
for
a
fighting
ground
french
cities
to
plunder
and
french
captives
to
hold
for
heavy
ransoms
they
were
content
to
let
matters
go
on
quietly
at
home
but
that
day
was
over
through
the
bad
management
if
not
through
the
positive
treachery
of
edmund

the

this

furnished
a
plausible
pretext

as
far
back
as

but
the
birth

gave

beneath

the
struggle
gradually
became

an

of
greater
importance
than
any
question
of
crowns
or
parties
though
then
none
was
wise
enough
to
see
its
real
significance
william
caxton
a
london
merchant
had
learned
the
new
art
of
printing
with
movable
type
at
bruges
in
flanders
now
belgium
when
he
returned
to
his
native
country
he
set
up
a
small
press
within
the
grounds
of
westminster
abbey
the
first
printing
in
europe
was
done
in
the
early
part
of
the
fifteenth
century
from
wooden
blocks
on
which
the
words
were
cut
movable
types
were
invented
about

at
the
sign
of
a
shield
bearing

pale
or
band
he
advertised
his
wares
as
good
chepe
he
was
not
only
printer
but
translator
and
editor
king
edward
gave
him
some
royal
patronage
his
majesty
was
willing
to
pay
liberally
for
work
which
was
not
long
before
the
clergy
in
france
had
condemned
as
a
black
art
emanating
from
the
devil
many
too
of
the
english
clergy
regarded
it
with
no
very
friendly
eye
since
it
threatened
to
destroy
the
copying
trade
of
which
the
monks
had
a
monopoly
the
first
printed
book
which
caxton
is
known
to
have
published
in
england
was
a
small
volume
entitled
the
sayings
of
the
philosophers
this
venture
was
followed
in
due
time
by
canterbury
tales
and
whatever
other
poetry
history
or
classics
seemed
worthy
of
preservation
making
in
all
nearly
a
hundred
distinct
works

than
eighteen
thousand

caxton
at

the

up
to
this
time
a

of

was
a
luxury
laboriously
written
by
the
few
for
the
few
but
from
this
date
literature
of
all
sorts
was
destined
to
multiply

fill

many

some
good

were
choice
and
when
one
of
them
the
earl
of

was
beheaded
in

caxton
said
the

did
then

than
was
left
in
all
the
heads
of

towards

close
of

the

however
cared
more
for
his
pleasures
than
for
literature
or
the
welfare
of
the
nation
his
chief
aim
was
to
beg
borrow
or
extort
money
to
waste
in
dissipation
the
loans
which
he
forced
his
subjects
to
grant
and
which
were
seldom
if
ever
repaid
went
under
the
name
of
benevolences
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
those
who
furnished
them
were
in
no
very
benevolent
frame
of
mind
at
the
time
exception
may
perhaps
be
made
of
the
rich
and
elderly
widow
who
was
so
pleased
with
the

that
she
willingly
handed
him

a

sum
in
those
days
and
when
the

kissed
her
out
of
gratitude
for
her
generosity
she
at

like

true
and

edward
course
of
life
was
not
conducive
to

days
even
if
the
times
had
favored
a
long
reign
he
died
early
leaving
a
son
prince
edward
to
succeed
him
summary
the
reign
was
marked
by
the
continuation
of
the
wars
of
the

the
death
of
king
henry
vi
and
of
his
son
with
the
return
of
queen
margaret
to
france
the
most
important
event
outside
of
the

was
the
introduction
of
the
printing

into
england
by
william
caxton
edward
v
house
of
york
white
rose
gloucester
appointed
protector
prince
edward
heir
to
the
throne
was
a
lad
of
twelve
his
position
was
naturally
full
of
peril
it
became
much
more
so
from
the
fact
that
his
ambitious
and
unscrupulous
uncle
richard
duke
of
gloucester
had
been
appointed
lord
protector
of
the
realm
until
the
boy
should
become
of
age
richard
protected
his
young
nephew
as
a
wolf
would
protect
a
lamb
he
met
the
prince
coming
up
to
london
from
ludlow
castle
shropshire
attended
by
his
half
brother
sir
richard
grey
and
his
uncle
lord
rivers
under
the
pretext
that
edward
would
be
safer
in
the
tower
of
london
than
at
westminster
palace
richard
sent
the
prince
there
and
soon
found
means
for
having
his
kinsmen
grey
and
rivers
executed
murder
of
lord
hastings
and
the
two
princes
richard
shortly
after
showed
his
object
lord
hastings
was
one
of
the
council
who
had
voted
to
make
him
lord
protector
but
he
was
unwilling
to
help
him
in
his
plot
to
seize
the
crown
while
at
the
council
table
in
the
tower
of
london
richard
suddenly
started
up
and
accused
hastings
of
treason
saying
by
paul
i
will
not
to
dinner
till
i
see
thy
head
off
hastings
was
dragged
out
of
the
room
and
without
either
trial
or
examination
was
beheaded
on
a
stick
of
timber
on
the
tower
green
the
way
was
now
clear
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
duke
purpose
the
queen
mother
elizabeth
woodville
widow
of
edward
iv
took
her
younger
son
and
his
sisters
one
of
whom
was
the
princess
elizabeth
of
york
and
fled
for
protection
to
the
sanctuary
of
westminster
abbey
where
refusing
all
comfort
she
sat
alone
on
the
stone
floor
finally
richard
half
persuaded
and
half
forced
the
unhappy
woman
to
give
up
her
second
son
to
his
tender
care
with
bitter
weeping
and
dread
presentiments
of
evil
she
parted
from
him
saying
farewell
mine
own
sweet
son
god
send
you
good
keeping
let
me
kiss
you
once
ere
you
go
for
god
knoweth
when
we
shall
kiss
together
again
that
was
the
last
time
she
saw
the
lad
he
and
edward
his
elder
brother
were
soon
after
murdered
in
the
tower
and
richard
rose
by
that
double
crime
to
the
height
he
coveted
summary
edward
v
nominal
reign
of
less
than
three
months
must
be
regarded
simply
as
the
time
during
which
his
uncle
the
duke
of
gloucester
perfected
his
plot
for
seizing
the
crown
by
the
successive
murders
of

and
the

own
he
probably
gained
over
an

character
several
attempts
have
been
made
of
late
years
to
defend
the
king
against
the
odium
heaped
upon
him
by
the
older
historians
but
these
efforts
to
prove
him
less
black
than
tradition
painted
him
are
answered
by
the
fact
that
his
memory
was
thoroughly
hated
by
those
who
knew
him
best
no
one
of
the
age
when
he
lived
thought
of
vindicating
his
character
he
was
called
a
hypocrite
and
a
hunchback
we
must
believe
then
until
it
is
clearly
proved
to
the
contrary
that
the
last
of
the
yorkist
kings
was
what
common
report
and
shakespeare
have
together
represented
him
distorted
in
figure
and
with
ambition
so
unrestrained
that
the
words
the
great
english
poet
has
seen
fit
to
put
into
his
mouth
may
have
really
expressed
richard
own
thought

to

in

connection
it
may
be
well
to
say
a
word
in
regard
to
the
historical
value
of
shakespeare
utterances
which
have
been
freely
quoted
in
this
book
he
generally
followed
the
chronicles
of
hall
and
holinshed
which
constitute
two
important
sources
of
information
on
the
periods
of
which
they
treat
and
he
sometimes
followed
them
so
closely
that
he
simply
turned
their
prose
into
verse

pounds

in

the

was
to

more
than
the

no

to
have
taken

in

these

with

caused
the

of

in

the

demanded
the

to

to
have
had

richard

abolished
this
obnoxious
system
but
afterward
revived
it
and
it
became
conspicuously
hateful
under
his
successor
in
the
next
period
another
great
grievance
was
purveyance
by
it
the

purveyors
had
the
right
to
seize

of

for
the
king
and
his
hundreds
of
attendants
whenever
they
journeyed
through
the
country
on
a
royal
progress
the
price
offered
by
the
purveyors
was
always
much
below
the
real
value
of
what
was
taken
and
frequently
even
that
was
not
paid
purveyance
which
had
existed
from
the
earliest
times
was

abolished

up
to

had

at
an

the
age
was
not
favorable
to
literature
and
produced
no
great
writers
but
caxton
edited
and
published
a
large
number
of
works
many
of
which
he
translated
from
the
french
and
latin
the
two
books
which
throw
most
light
on
the

by

fortescue

intended
for
the
use
of

the
latter
work
is
remarkable
for
its
bold
declaration
that
the
king
has
the
delegation
of
power
from
the
people
and
he
has
no
just
claims
to
any
other
power
than
this
the
chief
justice
also
praises
the
courage
of
his
countrymen
and
declares
with
honest
pride
that
more
englishmen
are
hanged
in
england
in
one
year
for
robbery
and
manslaughter
than
are

henry

interest
in

founded
the
great
public
school
of
eton
which
ranks
next
in

to
that
of

the
money
for
its
endowment
was
obtained
by
the
appropriation
of

had
been
erected

henry
it
is
said
had
his
claim
to
the
throne
printed
by
caxton
and
distributed
broadcast
over
the
country
it
was
the
first
political
appeal
to
the
people
made
through
the
press
and
was
a
sign
of
the
new
period
upon
which
english
history
had
entered
since
caxton
began
his
great
work
the
kingdom
had
undergone
a
most
momentous
change
the
leading
nobles
like
the
earl
of
warwick
were
with
few
exceptions
dead
their
estates
were
confiscated
their
thousands
of
followers
either
buried
on
the
battlefield
or
dispersed
throughout
the
land
the
small
number
of
titled
families
remaining
was
no
longer
to
be
feared
the
nation
itself
though
it
had
taken
comparatively
little
part
in
the
war
was
weary
of
bloodshed
and
ready
for
peace
on
any
terms
the
accession
of
the
welsh
house
of
tudor
marks
the
beginning
of
a
long
period
of
almost
absolute
royal
power
the
nobility
were
too
weak
to
place
any
check
on
the
king
the
clergy
who
had
not
recovered
from
their
dread
of
lollardism
and
its
attacks
on
their
wealth
and
influence
were
anxious
for
a
strong
conservative
government
such
as
henry
promised
the
house
of
commons
had
no
clear
united
policy
and
though
the
first
parliament
put
certain
restrainst
on
the
crown
yet
they
were
never
really
enforced
the
truth
is
that
the
new
king
was
both
too
prudent
and
too
crafty
to
give
them
an
opportunity
by
avoiding
foreign
wars
he
dispensed
with
the
necessity
of
summoning
frequent
parliaments
and
with
demanding
large
sums
of
money
from
them
at
the
accession
of
henry
vii
parliament
imposed
the
following
checks
on
the
power
of
the
king
no
new
tax
to
be
levied
without
consent
of
parliament
no
new
law
to
be
made
without
the
same
consent
no
committal
to
prison
without
a
warrant
specifying
the
offense
and
the
trial
to
be
speedy
criminal
charges
and
questions
of
fact
in
civil
cases
to
be
decided
by
jury
the
officers
to
be
held
responsible
to
the
nation
by
thus
ruling
alone
for
a
large
part
of
the
time
henry
got
the
management
of
affairs
into
his
own
hands
and
transmitted
the
power
to
those
who
came
after
him
in
this
way
the
tudors
with
their
successors
the
stuarts
built
up
a
system
of
personal
sovereignty
or
power
unchecked
by
constitutional
restraints
it
continued
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
when
the
outbreak
of
the
great
civil
war
brought
it
to
an
end
forever
growth
of
a
stronger
feeling
of
nationality
it
would
be
an
error
however
to
consider
this
absolutism
of
the
crown
as
an
unmitigated
evil
on
the
contrary
it
was
in
one
important
direction
an
advantage
there
are
times
when
the
great
need
of
a
people
is
not
more
individual
liberty
but
greater
national
unity
spain
and
france
were
two
countries
consisting
of
a
collection
of
petty
feudla
states
their
nobility
were
always
trying
to
steal
each
other
possessions
and
cut
each
other
throats
but
the
rise
in
each
country
of
a
royal
despotism
forced
the
turbulent
barons
to
make
peace
and
to
obey
a
common
central
law
by
this
means
both
realms
ultimately
developed
into
great
and
powerful
kingdoms
when
the
tudors
came
to
the
throne
england
was
still
full
of
rankling
hate
engendered
by
the
wars
of
the
roses
held
down
by
the
heavy
hand
of
henry
vii
and
later
by
the
still
heavier
one
of
henry
viii
the
country
learned
the
same
salutary
lesson
of
growth
under
repression
which
had
benefited
spain
and
france
henceforth
englishmen
of
all
classes
no
longer
boasted
that
they
belonged
to
the
yorkist
or
the
lancastrian
faction
but
began
to
pride
themselves
on
their
loyalty
to
crown
and
country
and
their
readiness
to
draw
their
swords
to
defend
both
but
the
passage
of
poyning
act
in
ireland
prohibited
the
irish
parliament
from
passing
any
law
which
did
not
receive
the
sanction
of
the
english
council
this
act
was
not
repealed
until

methods

money
the
court
of
star
chamber
henry
reign
was
in
the
interest
of
the
middle
classes
the
farmers
tradesmen
and
mechanics
his
policy
was
to
avoid
heavy
taxation
to
exempt
the
poor
from
the
burdens
of
state
and
so
ingratiate
himself
with
a
large
body
of
the
people
in
order
to
accomplish
this
he
revived
benevolences
and
by
a
device
suggested
by
his
chief
minister
cardinal
morton
and
hence
known
and
dreaded
as
morton
fork
he
extorted
large
sums
from
the
rich
and
those
whose
income
from
land
was
less
than
or
whose
movable
property
did
not
exceed
pounds
say
pounds
and
now
were
exempt
the
lowest
rate
of
assessment
for
the
benevolences
was
fixed
at
twenty
pence
on
the
pound
on
land
and
half
that
rate
on
other
property
the
cardinal
agents
made
it
their
business
to
learn
every
income
and
visit
him
accordingly
if
a
person
lived
handomely
the
cardinal
would
insist
on
a
correspondingly
liberal
gift
if
however
a
citizen
lived
very
plainly
the
king
minister
insisted
none
the
less
telling
the
unfortunate
man
that
by
his
economy
he
must
surely
have
accumulated
enough
to
bestow
the
required
benevolence
thus
on
one
prong
or
the
other
of
his
terrible
fork
the
shrewd
cardinal
impaled
his
writhing
victims
and
speedily
filled
the
royal
treasury
as
it
had
never
been
filled
before
richard
reed
a
london
alderman
refused
to
contribute
a
benevolence
he
was
sent
to
serve
as
a
soldier
in
the
scotch
wars
at
his
own
expense
and
the
general
was
ordered
to
use
him
in
all
things
according
to
sharp
military
discipline
the
effect
was
such
that
few
after
that
ventured
to
deny
the
king
what
he
asked
henry
is
said
to
have
accumulated
a
fortune
of
nearly
two
millions
sterling
an
amount
which
would
perhaps
represent
upwards
of
now
but
henry
vii
had
other
methods
for
raising
money
he
sold
offices
in
church
and
state
and
took
bribes
for
pardoning
rebels
when
he
summoned
a
parliament
he
obtained
grants
for
putting
down
some
real
or
pretended
insurrection
or
to
defray
the
expenses
of
a
threatened
attack
from
abroad
and
then
quietly
pocketed
the
appropriation
a
device
not
altogether
unknown
to
modern
government
officials
a
third
and
last
method
for
getting
funds
was
invented
in
behalf
by
two
lawyers
empson
and
dudley
who
were
so
rapacious
and
cut
so
close
that
they
were
commonly
known
as
the
king
skin
shearers
they
went
about
the
country
enforcing
old
and
forgotten
laws
by
which
they
reaped
a
rich
harvest
their
chief
instrument
for
gain
however
was
a
revival
of
the
statute
of
liveries
this
law
imposed
enormous
fines
on
those
noblemen
who
dared
to
equip
their
followers
in
military
garb
or
designate
them
by
a
badge
equivalent
to
it
as
had
been
the
custom
during
the
late
civil
wars
in
order
to
thoroughly
enforce
the
statute
of
liveries
henry
organized
the
court
of
star
chamber
so
called
from
the
starred
ceiling
where
the
tribunal
met
this
court
had
for
its
object
the
punishment
of
such
crimes
committed
by
the
great
families
or
their
adherents
as
the
ordinary
law
courts
could
not
or
through
intimidation
dared
not

seemed
to
have
enforced
the
law
of
livery
against
friend
and
foe
alike
said
the
king
to
the
earl
of
oxford
as
he
left
his
castle
where
a
large
number
of
retainers
in
uniform
were
drawn
up
to
do
him
honor
my
lord
i
thank
you
for
your
entertainment
but
my
attorney
must
speak
to
you
the
attorney
who
was
the
notorious
empson
brought
suit
in
the
star
chamber
against
the
earl
who
was
fined
fifteen
thousand
marks
or
something
like
for
the
incautious
display
he
had
made
the
introduction
of
artillery
strengthens
the
power
of
the
king
it
was
easier
for
henry
to
pursue
this
arbitrary
course
because
the
introduction
of
artillery
had
changed
the
art
of
war
throughout
the
middle
ages
the
call
of
a
great
baron
had
as
macaulay
says
been
sufficient
to
raise
a
formidable
revolt
countrymen
and
followers
took
down
their
tough
yew
long
bows
from
the
chimney
corner
knights
buckled
on
their
steel
armor
mounted
their
horses
and
in
a
few
days
an
army
threatened
the
holder
of
the
throne
who
had
no
troops
save
those
furnished
by
loyal
subjects
but
since
then
men
had
digged
villainous
saltpeter
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
harmless
earth
to
manufacture
powder
and
others
had
invented
cannon
those
devilish
iron
engines
as
the
poet
spenser
called
them
ordained
to
kill
without
artillery
the
old
feudal
army
with
its
bows
swords
and
could
do
little
against
a
king
like
henry
who
had
it
for
this
reason
the
whole
kingdom
lay
at
his
mercy
and
though
the
nobles
and
the
rich
might
groan
they
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
fight
the
pretenders
symnel
and
warbeck
during
henry
reign
two
pretenders
laid
claim
to
the
crown
lambert
symnel
who
represented
himself
to
be
edward
plantagenet
nephew
of
the
late
king
and
perkin
warbeck
who
asserted
that
he
was
richard
duke
of
york
who
had
been
murdered
in
the
tower
by
his
uncle
richard
iii
symnel
attempt
was
easily
suppressed
and
he
commuted
his
claim
to
the
crown
for
the
position
of
scullion
in
the
kitchen
warbeck
kept
the
kingdom
in
a
turmoil
for
more
than
five
years
during
which
time
one
hundred
and
fifty
of
his
adherents
were
executed
and
their
bodies
exposed
on
gibbets
along
the
south
coast
of
england
to
deter
their
master
french
supporters
from
landing
at
length
warbeck
was
captured

henry
politic
marriages
henry
accomplished
more
by
the
marriages
of
his
children
and
by
diplomacy
than
other
monarchs
had
by
their
wars
he
gave
his
daughter
margaret
to
king
james
iv
of
scotland
and
thus
prepared
the
way
for
the
union
of
the
two
kingdoms
in
he
married
his
eldest
son
prince
arthur
to
catharine
of
aragon
daughter
of
the
king
of
spain
by
which
he
secured
a
very
large
marriage
portion
for
the
prince
and
what
was
of
equal
importance
the
alliance
of
spain
against
france
arthur
died
soon
afterward
and
the
king
got
a
dispensation
from
the
pope
granting
him
permission
to
marry
his
younger
son
henry
to
arthur
widow
it
was
this
prince
who
eventually
became
king
of
england
with
the
title
of
henry
viii
and
we
shall
hereafter
see
that
this
marriage
was
destined
by
its
results
to
change
the
whole
course
of
the
country
history
the
world
as
known
at
henry
accession
the
king
also
took
some
small
part
in
certain
other
events
which
seemed
to
him
at
the
time
of
less
consequence
than
these
matrimonial
alliances
but
history
has
regarded
them
in
a
different
light
from
that
in
which
the
cunning
and
cautious
monarch
considered
them
a
glance
at
the
map
opposite
will
sho
how
different
our
world
is
from
that
with
which
the
english
were
acquainted
when
henry
was
crowned
then
the
earth
was
generally
supposed
to
be
a
flat
body
surrounded
by
the
ocean
the
only
countries
of
which
anything
was
certainly
known
with
the
exception
of
europe
were
parts
of
western
asia
together
with
a
narrow
strip
of
the
northern
eastern
and
western
coasts
of
africa
the
knowledge
which
had
once
existed
of
india
china
and
japan
appears
to
have
died
out
in
great
measure
with
the
travelers
and
merchants
of
earlier
times
who
had
brought
it
the
land
farthest
west
of
which
anything
was
then
known
was

of

the
cabots
about
the
time
of
henry

a
new
spirit
of

sprang
up
the
portuguese
had
coasted
along
the
western
shores
of
africa
as
far
as
the
gulf
of
guinea
and
had
established
trading
posts
there
later
they
reached
and
doubled
the
cape
of
good
hope
stimulated
by
what
they
had
done
columbus
who
believed
the
earth
to
be
round
determined
to
sail
westward
in
the
hope
of
reaching
the
indies
in
he
made
his
first
voyage
and
discovered
a
number
of
the
west
india
islands
five
years
afterward
john
cabot
a
venetian
residing
in
bristol
england
with
his
son
sebastian
persuaded
the
king
to
aid
them
in
a
similar
undertaking
they
sailed
from
that
port
on
a
map
drawn
by
the
father
after
his
return
we
read
the
following
lines
in
the
year
of
our
lord
john
cabot
and
his
son
sebastian
discovered
that
country
which
no
one
before
his
time
had
ventured
to
approach
on
the
june
about
in
the
morning
that
entry
is
supposed
to
record
the
discovery
of
cape
breton
island
a
few
days
later
they
set
foot
on
the
mainland
this
made
the
cabots
the
first
discoverers
of
the
american
continent
as
an
offset
to
that
record
we
have
the
following
taken
from
the
king
private
account
book
to
him
that
found
the
new
isle
pounds
such
was
the
humble
beginning
of
a
series
of
explorations
which
gave
england
possession
of
the
largest
part
of
north
america
henry
vii
reign
the
beginning
of
a
new
epoch
a
few
years
after
cabot
return
henry
laid
the
corner
stone
of
that
solemn
and
sumptuous
chapel
which
bears
his
own
name
and
which
joins
westminster
abbey
on
the
east
there
he
gave
orders
that
his
tomb
should
be
erected
and
that
prayers
should
be
said
over
it
as
long
as
the
world
lasted
emerson
remarks
in
his
english
traits
that
when
the
visitor
to
the
abbey
mounts
the
flight
of
twelve
black
marble
steps
which
lead
from
it
to
the
edifice
where
henry
lies
buried
he
passes
from
the
medieval
to
the
beginning
of
the
modern
age
a
change
which
the
different
style
of
the
architecture
distinctly
marks
the
true
significance
of
henry
reign
is
that
it
in
like
manner
stands
for
a
new
epoch
new
in
modes
of
government
in
law
in
geographical
discovery
in
letters
art
and
religion
the
century
just
closing
was
indeed
one
of
the
most
remarkable
in
history
not
only
in
what
it
had
actually
accomplished
but
still
more
in
the
seed
it
was
sowing
for
the
future
the
celebrated
german
artist
kaulbach
in
his
fresco
of
the
age
of
the
reformation
has
summed
up
all
that
it
was
and
all
that
it
was
destined
to
become
in
its
full
development
therein
we
see
it
as
the
period
which
witnessed
the
introduction
of
firearms
and
the
consequent
overthrow
of
feudal
warfare
and
feudal
institutions
the
growth
of
the
power
of
royalty
and
of
nationality
through
royalty
the
sailing
of
columbus
and
of
cabot
the
revival
of
classical
learning
the
publication
of
the
first
printed
book
and
finally
the
birth
of
martin
luther
the
monk
who
broke
away
from
the
catholic
church
and
persuaded
many
people
to
become
protestants
summary
looking
back
we
find
that
with
henry
vii
the
absolutism
of
the
crown
or
personal
monarchy
began
in
england
yet
the
repressive
power
of
that
personal
monarchy
procured
peace
for
the
english
people
and
despite
benevolences
and
other
exactions
they
grew
into
a
stronger
national
unity
simultaneously
with
this
increase
of
royal
authority
came
the
discovery
of
a
new
world
in
which
england
and
her
colonies
were
to
have
the
chief
part
a
century
will
elapse
before
those
discoveries
begin
to
bear
fruit
after
that
our
attention
will
no
longer
be
confined
to
the
british
islands
but
will
be
fixed
as
well
on
that
western
continent
where
british
enterprise
and
english
love
of
liberty
were
destined
to
find
a
new
and
broader
field
of
activity
henry

advantages
henry
viii
was
not
quite
eighteen
when
he
came
to
the
throne
the
country
was
at
peace
was
fairly
prosperous
and
the
young
king
had
everything
in
his
favor
he
was
handsome
well
educated
and
fond
of
athletic
sports
his
frank
disposition
won
friends
everywhere
and
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
the
largest
private
fortune
that
had
ever
descended
to
an
english
sovereign
intellectually
he
was
in
hearty
sympathy
with
the
revival
of
learning
then
in
progress
both
on
the
continent
and
in
england
the
new
learning
colet
erasmus
more
during
the
greater
part
of
the
middle
ages
the
chief
object
of
education
was
to
make
men
monks
and
originally
the
schools
established
at
oxford
and
cambridge
were
exclusively
for
that
purpose
in
their
day
they
did
excellent
work
but
a
time
came
when
men
ceased
to
found
monasteries
and
began
to
erect
colleges
and
hospitals
instead
in
the
twelfth
century
four
hundred
and
eighteen
monasteries
were
founded
in
england
in
the
next
century
only
about
a
third
as
many
in
the
fourteenth
only
after
that
date
their
establishment
may
be
said
to
cease
in
the
course
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
william
of
wykeham
and
king
henry
vi
built
and
endowed
colleges
which
were
specially
designed
to
fit
their
pupils
to
live
in
the
world
and
serve
the
state
instead
of
withdrawing
from
it
to
seek
their
own
salvation
these
new
institutions
encouraged
a
broader
range
of
studies
and
in
henry
vi
time
particular
attention
was
given
to
the
latin
classics
hitherto
but
little
known
the
geographical
discoveries
of
henry
vii
reign
made
by
columbus
cabot
and
others
began
to
stimulate
scientific
thought
it
was
evident
that
the
day
was
not
far
distant
when
questions
about
the
earth
and
the
stars
would
no
longer
be
settled
by
a
text
from
scripture
which
forbade
further
inquiry
with
the
accession
of
henry
viii
education
received
a
still
further
impulse
a
few
zealous
english
scholars
had
just
returned
from
italy
to
oxford
full
of
ardor
for
a
new
study
that
of
greek
among
them
was
a
young
clergyman
named
john
colet
he
saw
that
by
means
of
that
language
of
which
the
alphabet
was
as
yet
hardly
known
in
england
men
might
put
themselves
in
direct
communication
with
the
greatest
thinkers
and
writers
of
the
past
better
still
they
might
acquire
the
power
of
reading
the
gospels
and
the
writings
of
paul
in
the
original
and
thus
reach
their
true
meaning
and
feel
their
full
influence
colet
intimate
friend
and
fellow
worker
the
dutch
scholar
erasmus
had
the
same
enthusiasm
when
in
sore
need
of
everything
he
wrote
in
one
of
his
letters
as
soon
as
i
get
some
money
i
shall
buy
greek
books
and
then
i
may
buy
some
clothes
the
third
young
man
who
with
erasmus
and
colet
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
greek
and
to
the
advancement
of
learning
was
thomas
more
who
later
became
lord
chancellor
the
three
looked
to
king
henry
for
encouragement
in
the
work
they
had
undertaken
nor
did
they
look
in
vain
colet
who
had
become
a
doctor
of
divinity
and
a
dean
of
paul
cathedral
london
encountered
a
furious
storm
of
opposition
on
account
of
his
devotion
to
the
new
learning
as
it
was
sneeringly
called
his
attempts
at
educational
reform
met
the
same
resistance
but
henry
liked
the
man
resolute
spirit
and
said
let
others
have
what
doctors
they
will
this
is
the
doctor
for
me
the
king
also
took
a
lively
interest
in
erasmus
who
was
appointed
professor
of
greek
at
cambridge
where
he
began
his
great
work
of
preparing
an
edition
of
the
greek
testament
with
a
latin
translation
in
parallel
columns
up
to
this
time
the
greek
testament
had
existed
in
scattered
manuscripts
only
the
publication
of
the
work
in
printed
form
gave
an
additional
impetus
to
the
study
of
the
scriptures
helped
forward
the
reformation
and
in
a
measure
laid
the
foundation
for
a
revised
english
translation
of
the
bible
far
superior
to
wycliffe
in
the
same
spirit
of
genuine
love
of
learning
henry
founded
trinity
college
cambridge
and
at
a
later
date
confirmed
and
extended

wolsey
endowment
of
christ
church
college
oxford
henry
against
luther
the
king
continued
however
to
be
a
staunch
catholic
and
certainly
had
no
thought
at
this
period
of
doing
anything
which
should
tend
to
undermine
the
authority
of
that
ancient
form
of
worship
in
germany
martin
luther
was
making
ready
to
begin
his
tremendous
battle
against
the
power
and
teachings
of
the
papacy
in
he
nailed
to
the
door
of
the
church
of
wittenberg
that
famous
series
of
denunciations
which
started
the
movement
that
ultimately
protested
against
the
authority
of
rome
and
gave
the
name
of
protestant
to
all
who
joined
it
a
few
years
later
henry
published
a
reply
to
one
of
luther
books
and
sent
a
copy
bound
in
cloth
of
gold
to
the
pope
the
pope
was
so
delighted
with
what
he
termed
henry
angelic
spirit
that
he
forthwith
conferred
on
him
the
title
of
defender
of
the
faith
the
english
sovereigns
have
persisted
in
retaining
this
title
to
the
present
time
though
for
what
reason
and
with
what
right
even
a
royal
intellect
might
be
somewhat
puzzled
to
explain
with
this
new
and
flattering
title
the
pope
also
sent
the
king
a
costly
sword
intended
to
represent
henry
zeal
in
smiting
the
enemies
of
rome
but
it
was
destined
by
fate
to
become
to
tsymbol
of
the
king
final
separation
from
the
power
that
bestowed
it
victory
of
flodden
field
of
the
cloth

politically
henry
was
equally
fortunate
the
scotch
had
ventured
to
attack
the
kingdom
during
the
king
absence
on
the
continent
at
flodden
on
the
borders
of
scotland
and
england
they
were
defeated
by

henry
held
the
balance
of
power
by
which
he
could
make
france
or
germany
predominate
as
he
saw
fit
it
was
owing
to
his
able
diplomatic
policy
or
to
that
of

wolsey

chief
counsellor
that
england
reaped
advantages
from
both
sides
and
advanced
from

comparatively
low
position

that
was

abreast

was

twelve

reasons
catharine

could
not
bear
the
thought
of
being
disappointed
in
fact
he
sent
the
duke
of
buckingham
to
the
block
for
casually
saying
that
if
the
king
died
without
issue
he
should
consider
himself
entitled
to
receive
the
crown
it
was
while
meditating
this
question
of
the
succession
that
henry
became
attached
to
anne
boleyn
one
of
the
queen
maids
of
honor
she
was
a
sprightly
brunette
of
nineteen
with
long
black
hair
and
strikingly
beautiful
eyes
the
light
that
shone
in
those
eyes
though
hardly
that
gospel
light
which
the
poet
calls
it
was
yet
bright
enough
to
effectually
clear
up
all
difficulties
in
the
royal
mind
the
king
now
declared
that
he
felt
conscientiously
moved
to
obtain
a
divorce
from
his
old
wife
and
to
marry
a
new
one
in
that
determination
lay
most
momentous
consequences
since
it
finally
separated
england
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
church
of
rome
when
love
could
teach
a
monarch
to
be
wise
and
gospel
light
first
dawned
from
bullen
boleyn
eyes
gray
wolsey
favors
the
divorce
from
catharine
cardinal
wolsey
henry
chief
counselor
the
man
who
thought
that
he
ruled
both
king
and
kingdom
lent
his
powerful
aid
to
bring
about
the
divorce
but
with
the
expectation
that
the
king
would
marry
a
princess
from
france
and
thus
form
an
alliance
with
that
country
if
so
his
own
ambitious
schemes
would
be
forwarded
since
the
united
influence
of
the
two
kingdoms
might
elevate
him
to
the
papacy
the
venetian
ambassador
in
a
dispatch
to
his
government
wrote
of
cardinal
wolsey
it
is
he
who
rules
both
the
king
and
the
entire
kingdom
at
first
the
cardinal
used
to
say
majesty
will
do
so
and
so
subsequently
he
went
on
forgetting
himself
and
commenced
saying
shall
do
so
and
so
at
present
he
has
reached
such
a
pitch
that
he
says
shall
do
so
and
so
when
wolsey
learned
that
the
king
choice
was
anne
boleyn
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
begged
him
not
to
persist
in
his
purpose
but
his
entreaties
had
no
effect
and
the
cardinal
was
obliged
to
continue
what
he
had
begun
the
court
at
blackfriars
the
king
had
applied
to
the
pope
to
annul
the
marriage
with
catharine
on
the
ground
of
illegality
but
the
emperor
charles
v
who
was
the
queen
nephew
used
his
influence
in
her
behalf
vexatious
delays
now
became
the
order
of
the
day
at
last
a
court
composed
of
cardinal
wolsey
and
cardinal
campeggio
an
italian
as
papal
legates
or
representatives
was
convened
at
blackfriars
london
to
test
the
validity
of
the
marriage
henry
and
catharine
were
summoned
the
first
appeared
and
answered
to
his
name
when
the
queen
was
called
she
declined
to
answer
but
throwing
herself
at
henry
feet
begged
him
with
tears
and
sobs
not
to
put
her
away
without
cause
finding
him
inflexible
she
left
the
court
and
refused
to
attend
again
appealing
to
rome
for
justice
this
was
in
the
spring
nothing
was
done
that
summer
and
in
the
autumn
the
court
instead
of
reaching
a
decision
dissolved
campeggio
the
italian
legate
returned
to
italy
and
henry
to
his
disappointment
and
rage
received
an
order
from
rome
to
carry
the
question
to
the
pope
for
settlement
fall
of
wolsey
both
the
king
and
anne
boleyn
believed
that
wolsey
had
played
false
with
them
they
now
resolved
upon
his
destruction
the
cardinal
had
a
presentiment
of
his
impending
doom
the
french
ambassador
who
saw
him
at
this
juncture
said
that
his
face
had
shrunk
to
half
its
size
but
his
fortunes
were
destined
to
shrink
even
more
than
his
face
by
a
law
of
richard
ii
no
representative
of
the
pope
had
any
rightful
authority
in
england
though
the
king
had
given
his
consent
to
wolsey
holding
the
office
of
legate
yet
now
that
a
contrary
result
to
what
he
expected
had
been
reached
he
proceeded
to
prosecute
him
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law
act
of
praemunire
see
and
summary
of
constitutional
history
in
the
appendix
xiii
and
xxxii
it
was
an
easy
matter
for
him
to
crush
the
cardinal
erasmus
said
of
him
he
was
feared
by
all
he
was
loved
by
few
i
may
say
by
nobody
his
arrogance
and
extravagant
ostentation
had
excited
the
jealous
hate
of
the
nobility
his
constant
demands
for
money
in
behalf
of
the
king
set
parliament
against
him
and
his
exactions
from
the
common
people
had
as
the
chronicle
of
the
time
tells
us
made
them
weep
beg
and
speak
cursedly
wolsey
bowed
to
the
storm
and
to
save
himself
gave
up
everything
his
riches
pomp
power
all
vanished
as
suddenly
as
they
had
come
it
was
henry
hand
that
stripped
him
but
it
was
anne
boleyn
who
moved
that
hand
well
might
the
humbled
favorite
say
of
her
there
was
the
weight
that
pulled
me
down
all
my
glories
in
that
one
woman

lost
forever

thus
deprived
of
everything
but

the
cardinal
was
permitted
to
go
into
retirement
in
the
north
less
than
a
later
he
was
arrested
on
a
charge
of
high
treason
through
the
irony
of
fate
the
warrant
was
served
by
a
former
lover
of
anne

whom
wolsey
it
is
said
had
separated
from
her
in
order
that
she
might
consummate
her
unhappy
marriage
with
royalty
on
the
way
to
london
wolsey
fell
mortally
ill
and
turned
aside
at

to
die
in

with

words
o

appeal
to
the
universities
before
wolsey
death
thomas
cranmer
of
cambridge
suggested
that
the
king
lay
the
divorce
question
before
the
universities
of
europe
henry
caught
eagerly
at
this
proposition
and
exclaimed
cranmer
has
the
right
pig
by
the
ear
the
scheme
was
at
once
adopted
several
universities
returned
favorable
answers
in
a
few
instances
as
at
oxford
and
cambridge
where
the
authorities
hesitated
a
judicious
use
of
bribes
or
threats
soon
brought
them
to
see
the
matter
in
a
proper
light
the
clergy
declare
henry
head
of
the
church
armed
with
these
decisions
in
his
favor
henry
now
charged
the
whole
body
of
the
english
church
with
being
guilty
of
the
same
crime
of
which
wolsey
had
been
accused
the
clergy
in
their
terror
made
haste
to
buy
a
pardon
at
a
cost
reckoned
at
nearly
at
the
present
value
of
money
they
furthermore
declared
henry
to
be
the
supreme
head
on
earth
of
the
church
of
england
adroitly
adding
in
so
far
as
is
permitted
by
the
law
of
christ
thus
the
reformation
came
into
england
by
a
side
door
as
it
were
nevertheless
it
came
henry
marries
anne
boleyn
act
of
supremacy
events
now
moved
rapidly
toward
a
crisis
in
after
having
waited
over
five
years
henry
privately
married
anne
boleyn
and
she
was
soon
after
crowned
in
westminster
abbey
when
the
pope
was
informed
of
this
he
ordered
the
king
under
pain
of
excommunication
to
put
her
away
and
to
take
back
queen
catharine
parliament
met
that
demand
by
passing
the
act
of
supremacy
which
declared
henry
to
be
without
reservation
the
sole
head
of
the
church
making
denial
thereof
high
treason
as
he
signed
the
act
the
king
with
one
stroke
of
his
pen
overturned
the
traditions
of
a
thousand
years
and
england
stood
boldly
forth
with
a
national
church
independent
of
the
pope
henry
full
title
was
now
henry
viii
by
the
grace
of
god
king
of
england
france
and
ireland
defender
of
the
faith
and
of
the
church
of
england
and
also
of
ireland
on
earth
the
supreme
head
attention
is
called
to
the
fact
that
a
controversy
more
or
less
serious
in
its
character
had
been
going
on
at
intervals
for
nearly
five
hundred
years
between
the
english
sovereigns
or
the
barons
and
the
popes
it
began
with
william
the
conqueror
in
it
was
continued
by
henry
i
by
henry
ii
by
john
by
the
barons
under
henry
iii
by
the
parliament
of
merton
by
edward
i
and
it
may
be
said
to
have
practically
culminated
under
henry
viii
in
the
act
of
supremacy
of
but
after
the
formal
establishment
of
protestantism
by
edward
vi
in
we
find
the
act
of
supremacy
reaffirmed
in
slightly
different
form
by
queen
elizabeth
in
finally
the
revolution
of
settled
the
question
subserviency
of
parliament
but
as
luther
said
henry
had
a
pope
within
him
the
king
now
proceeded
to
prove
the
truth
of
luther
declaration
we
have
already
seen
that
since
the
wars
of
the
roses
had
destroyed
the
power
of
the
barons
there
was
no
effectual
check
on
the
despotic
will
of
the
sovereign
the
new
nobility
were
the
creatures
of
the
crown
hence
bound
to
support
it
the
clergy
were
timid
the
commons
anything
but
bold
so
that
parliament
gradually
became
the
servile
echo
and
ready
instrument
of
the
throne
that
body
twice
released
the
king
from
the
discharge
of
his
just
debts
it
even
exempted
him
from
paying
certain
forced
loans
which
he
had
extorted
from
his
people
parliament
also
repeatedly
changed
the
laws
of
succession
to
the
crown
to
please
him
moreover
it
promptly
attainted
and
destroyed
such
victims
as
he
desired
to
put
out
of
the
way
later
it
declared
that
proclamations
concerning
religious
doctrines
when
made
by
the
king
and
council
should
have
the
force
of
acts
of
parliament
this
new
power
enabled
henry
to
pronounce
heretical
many
opinions
which
he
disliked
and
to
punish
them
with
death
execution
of
more
and
fisher
thomas
cromwell
had
been
cardinal
wolsey
private
secretary
but
he
had
now
become
chief
counselor
to
the
king
and
in
his
crooked
and
cruel
policy
reduced
bloodshed
to
a
science
he
first
introduced
the
practice
of
condemning
an
accused
prisoner
without
any
form
of
trial
by
act
of
attainder
and
sending
him
to
the
block
without
allowing
him
to
speak
in
his
own
defense
no
one
was
now
safe
who
did
not
openly
side
with
the
king
act
of
attainder
see
constitutional
documents
in
appendix
xxxii
sir
thomas
more
who
had
been
lord
chancellor
and
the
aged
bishop
fisher
were
executed
because
they
could
not
affirm
that
they
conscientiously
believed
that
henry
was
morally
and
spiritually
entitled
to
be
the
head
of
the
english
church
both
died
with
christian
fortitude

said
to
the
governor
of
the
tower
with
a
flash
of
his
old
humor
as
the
steps
leading
to
the
scaffold
shook
while
he
was
mounting
them

you

safe
up
and
i
will
make

to
get

myself
destruction
of
the
monasteries
seizure
of
their
property
when
the
intelligence
of
the
judicial
murder
of
the
venerable
reached
rome
the
pope
issued
a
bull
of
excommunication
and
deposition
against
henry
it
delivered
his
soul
to
satan
and
his
kingdom
to
the
first
invader
the
king
retaliated
by
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
in
doing
so
he
simply
hastened
a
process
which
had
already
begun
years
before
cardinal
wolsey
had
not
scrupled
to
shut
up
several
and
take
their
revenues
to
found
christ
church
college
at
oxford
the
truth
was
that
in
most
cases
monasticism
was
dead
long
before
the
reformation
came
to
bury
it
note
it
was
dead
because
it
had
done
its
work
in
many
respects
a
great
and
good
work
which
the
world
could
ill
have
spared
the
monasteries
simply
shared
the
fate
of
all
human
institutions
however
excellent
they
may
be
our
little
systems
have
their
day
they
have
their
day
and
cease
to
be
they
are
but
broken
lights
of
thee
and
thou
o
lord
art
more
than
they
tennyson
in
memoriam
henry
however
had
no
such
worthy
object
as
wolsey
had
his
pretext
was
that
these
institutions
had
sunk
into
a
state
of
ingnorance
drunkenness
and
profligacy
this
may
have
been
true
of
some
of
the
smaller
monasteries
though
not
of
the
large
ones
but
the
vices
of
the
monasteries
the
king
had
already
made
his
own
it
was
their
wealth
which
he
now
coveted
the
smaller
religious
houses
were
speedily
swept
out
of
existence
this
caused
a
furious
insurrection
in
the
north
called
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
but
the
revolt
was
soon
put
down
though
parliament
had
readily
given
its
sanction
to
the
extinction
of
the
smaller
monasteries
it
hesitated
about
abolishing
the
greater
ones
henry
it
is
reported
sent
for
a
leading
member
of
the
house
o
commons
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
kneeling
representative
said
get
my
bill
passed
by
little
man
or
else
this
head
of
yours
will
come
off
the
next
day
the
bill
passed
and
the
work
of
destruction
began
anew
property
worth
millions
of
pounds
was
confiscated
and
abbots
like
those
of
glastonbury
and
charter
house
who
dared
to
resist
were
speedily
hanged
the
total
number
of
religious
houses
destroyed
was
monasteries
chapels
collegiate
churches
and
charitable
institutions
among
the
most
famous
of
these
ruins
are
glastonbury
kirkstal
furness
netley
tintern
and
fountains
abbeys
the
magnificent
monastic
buildings
throughout
england
were
now
stripped
of
everything
of
value
and
left
as
ruins
see
map
opposite
the
beautiful
windowes
of
stained
glass
were
wantonly
broken
the
images
of
the
saints
were
cast
down
from
their
niches
the
chimes
of
bells
were
melted
and
cast
into
cannon
while
the
valuable
libraries
were
torn
up
and
sold
to
grocers
and
soap
boilers
for
wrapping
paper
at
canterbury
becket
tomb
was
broken
open
and
after
he
had
been
nearly
four
centuries
in
his
grave
the
saint
was
summoned
to
answer
a
charge
of
rebellion
and
treason
the
case
was
tried
at
westminster
abbey
the
martyr
bones
were
sentenceeed
to
be
burned
and
the
jewels
and
rich
offerings
of
his
shrine
were
seized
by
the
king
among
the
few
monastic
buildings
which
escaped
was
the
beautiful
abbey
church
now
the
cathedral
of
peterborough
where
catharine
of
aragon
who
died
soon
after
the
king
marriage
with
her
rival
was
buried
henry
had
the
grace
to
give
orders
that
on
her
account
it
should
be
spared
saying
that
he
would
leave
to
her
memory
one
of
the
goodliest
monuments
in
christendom
the
great
estates
thus
suddenly
acquired
by
the
crown
were
granted
to
favorites
or
thrown
away
at
the
gambling
table
it
is
from
this
date
says
hallam
that
the
leading
families
of
england
both
within
and
without
the
peerage
became
conspicuous
through
having
obtained
possession
of
the
monastery
lands
these
were
estimated
to
comprise
about
one
fourth
of
the
whole
area
of
the
kingdom
effects
of
the
destruction
of
monasteries
the
sweeping
character
of
this
act
had
a
twofold
effect
first
it
made
the
king
more
absolute
than
before
for
since
it
removed
the
abbots
who
had
held
seats
in
the
house
of
lords
that
body
was
made
just
so
much
smaller
and
less
able
to
resist
the
royal
will
next
the
abolition
of
so
many
religious
institutions
necessarily
caused
much
misery
for
the
greater
part
of
the
monks
and
all
of
the
nuns
were
turned
out
upon
the
world
destitute
of
means
in
the
end
however
no
permanent
injury
was
done
since
the
monasteries
by
their
profuse
and
indiscriminate
charity
had
undoubtably
encouraged
much
of
the
very
pauperism
which
they
had
relieved
distress
among
the
laboring
classes
an
industrial
revolution
was
also
in
progress
at
this
time
which
was
productive
of
widespread
suffering
it
had
begun
early
in
reign
through
the
great
numbers
of
discharged
soldiers
who
could
not
readily
find
work
sir
thomas
more
had
given
a
striking
picture
of
their
miserable
condition
in
his
utopia
a
book
in
which
he
urged
the
government
to
consider
measures
for
their
relief
but
the
evil
had
since
become
much
worse
farmers
having
discovered
that
wool
growing
was
more
profitable
than
the
raising
of
grain
had
turned
their
fields
into
sheep
pastures
so
that
a
shepherd
with
his
dog
now
took
the
place
of
several
families
of
laborers
this
change
brought
multitudes
of
poor
people
to
the
verge

set
to

characteristic
vigor

with
great
numbers

without
materially
abating
the
evil
execution
of
anne

with

three
years
after
her
coronation
the
new
queen
anne
boleyn
for
whom
henry
had
turned
england

europe
upside
down
was
accused
of
unfaithfulness
she
was

to
the

a
short

after
her

rolled

dust
the
light
of
its
beauty
gone
out

the
next

henry
married
jane

parliament
passed
an
act
of
approval
declaring
that
it
was
all
done
of
the
king
most
excellent
goodness
it
also
declared
henry
two
previous

with
catharine
and
with
anne
boleyn
void
and
affirmed
that
their
children
the
princesses
mary
and
elizabeth
were
not
lawfully
the
king
daughters
a
later
act
of
parliament
gave
henry
the
extraordinary
power
of
naming
his
successor
to
the
crown
a
year
afterwards
henry
new
queen
died
leaving
an
infant
son
edward
she
was
no
sooner
gone
than
the
king
began
looking
about
for
some
one
to
take
her
place
by
his
last
will
he
made
mary
and
elizabeth
heirs
to
the
crown
in

all

himself

his

passed
by

but
long
after
death
parliament
set
his
will
aside
and
made
james
i
a
descendent
of
margaret
king
of
england
more
marriages
thomas
cromwell
the
king
trusted
adviser
succeeded
in
persuading
his
master
to
agree
to
marry
anne
of
cleves
a
german
protestant
princess
henry
had
never
seen
her
but
her
portrait
represented
her
as
a
woman
of
surpassing
beauty
when
anne
reached
england
henry
hurried
to
meet
her
with
all
a
lover
ardor
to
his
dismay
he
found
that
not
only
was
she
ridiculously
ugly
but
that
she
could
speak
so
he
said
nothing
but
dutch
of
which
he
did
not
understand
a
word
matters
however
had
gone
too
far
to
retract
and
the
marriage
was
duly
solemnized
the
king
obtained
a
divorce
within
six
months
and
then
took
his
revenge
by
cutting
off
cromwell
head
what
is
more
he
cut
it
off
by
virtue
of
that
very
act
of
attainder
which
cromwell
had
used
so
unscrupulously
in
henry
behalf
the
same
year
henry
married
catharine
howard
a
fascinating
girl
still
in
her
teens
whose
charms
so
moved
the
king
that
it
is
said
he
was
tempted
to
have
a
special
thanksgiving
service
prepared
to
commemorate
the
day
he
found
her
unfortunately
catharine
was
accused
of
having
been
guilty
of
misconduct
before
her
marriage
she
confessed
her
fault
but
for
such
cases
henry
had
no
mercy
the
queen
was
tried
for
high
treason
and
soon
walked
that
fatal
road
in
which
anne
boleyn
had
preceded
her
not
to
be
baffled
in
his
matrimonial
experiments
the
king
took
catherine
parr
for
his
sixth
and
last
wife
she
was
inclined
to
be
a
zealous
protestant
and
she
too
might
have
gone
to
the
block
on
a
charge
of
heresy
but
her
quick
wit
came
to
her
rescue
she
flattered
the
king
as
a
profound
theologian
and
the
compliment
saved
her
life
henry
action
respecting
religion
though
occupied
with
these
rather
numerous
domestic
infelicities
henry
was
not
idle
in
other
directions
by
an
act
known
as
the
six
articles
or
as
the
protestants
called
it
the
bloody
act
or
the
whip
with
six
lashes
the
king
established
a
new
and
peculiar
form
of
religion
in
words
at
least
it
seemed
to
be
practically
the
same
as
that
upheld
by
the
pope
but
with
the
pope
left
out
the
six
articles
the
chief
article
ordered
that
all
persons
who
denied
the
catholic
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
should
be
burned
at
the
stake
as
heretics
and
that
all
their
possessions
should
be
forfeited
to
the
crown
the
remaining
five
articles
affirmed
the
obligation
of
all
persons
to
accept
and
obey
certain
other
catholic
doctrines
under
pain
of
punishment
for
felony
if
they
refused
geographically
the
country
was
about
equally
divided
between
catholicism
and
protestantism
the
northwestern
half
clung
to
the
ancient
faith
the
southeastern
half
including
most
of
the
large
cities
where
wycliffe
doctrines
had
formerly
prevailed
was
favorable
to
the
reformation
on
the
one
hand
henry
prohibited
the
lutheran
or
protestant
doctrine
on
the
other
he
caused
the
bible
to
be
translated
and
ordered
a
copy
to
be
chained
to
a
desk
in
every
parish
church
in
england
but
though
all
persons
might
now
freely
read
the
scriptures
no
one
but
the
clergy
was
allowed
to
interpret
them
later
in
his
reign
the
king
became
alarmed
at
the
spread
of
discussion
about
religious
subjects
and
prohibited
the
reading
of
the
bible
by
the
lower
sort
of
people
henry
versus
treason
men
now
found
themselves
in
a
strange
and
cruel
delimma
if
it
was
dangerous
to
believe
too
much
it
was
equally
dangerous
to
believe
too
little
traitor
and
heretic
were
dragged
to
execution
on
the
same
hurdle
for
henry
burned
as
heretics
those
who
declared
their
belief
in
protestantism
and
hanged
or
beheaded
as
traitors
those
who
acknowledged
the
authority
of
the
pope
and
denied
the
supremacy
of
the
king
thus
anne
askew
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
was
nearly
wrenched
asunder
on
the
rack
in
the
hope
of
making
her
implicate
the
queen
in
her
heresy
she
was
afterward
burned
because
she
insisted
that
the
bread
and
wine
used
in
the
communion
service
seemed
to
her
to
be
simply
bread
and
wine
and
not
in
any
sense
the
actual
body
and

of

of
the
six
articles
solemnly
declared
on
the
other
hand
the
aged
countess
of
salisbury
suffered
for
treason
but
with
a
spirit
matching
the
king
she
refused
to
kneel
at
the
block
and
told
the
executioner
he
must
get
her
gray
head
off
as
best
he
could
henry

but
the
time
was
at
hand
when
henry
was
to
cease
his
hangings
beheadings
and
marriages
worn
out
with
debauchery
he
died
at
the
age
of
a
loathsome
unwieldy
and
helpless
mass
of
corruption
in
his
will
he
left
a
large
sum
of
money
to
pay
for
perpetual
prayers
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
sir
walter
raleigh
said
of
him
if
all
the
pictures
and
patterns
of
a
merciless
prince
were
lost
in
the
world
they
might
all
again
be
painted
to
the
life
out
of
the
story
of
this
king
it
may
be
well
to
remember
this
and
along
with
it
this
other
saying
of
one
of
the
ablest
writers
on
english
constitutional
history
that
the
world
owes
some
of
tis
greatest
debts
to
men
from
whose
memory
it
recoils
the
obligation
it
is
under
to
henry
viii
is
that
through
his
influence
no
matter
what
the
motive
england
was
lifted
up
out
of
the
old
medieval
ruts
and
placed
squarely
and
securely

constitutional
history

summary
in
this
reign
we
find
that
though
england
lost
much
of
her
former
political
freedom
yet
she
gained
that
order
and
peace
which
came
from
the
iron
hand
of
absolute
power
next
from
the
destruction
of
the
monasteries
and
the
sale
or
gift
of
their
lands
to
favorites
of
the
king
three
results
ensued
a
new
nobility
was
in
great
measure
created
dependent
on
the
crown
the
house
of
lords
was
made
less
powerful
by
the
removal
of
the
abbots
who
had
had
seats
in
it
pauperism
and
distress
were
temporarily
increased
finally
england
completely
severed
her
connection
with
the

and
established
for
the
first
time
an
independent

edward
son
of

by
jane
seymour
died
at
sixteen
in
the
first
part
of
his
reign
of
six
years
the
goverment
was
managed
by
his
uncle
the
duke
of
somerset
an
extreme
protestant
whose
intentions
were
good
but
who
lacked
practical
judgement
during
the
latter
part
of
his
life
edward
fell
under
the
control
of
the
duke
of
northumberland
who
was
the
head
of
a
band
of
scheming
and
profligate
men
they
with
other
nobles
seized
the
unenclosed
lands
of
the
country
and
fenced
them
in
for
sheep
pastures
thus
driving
into
beggary
many
who
had
formerly
got
a
good
part
of
their
living
from
these
commons
at
the
same
time
farm
rents
rose
in
somee
cases
ten
and
even
twenty
fold
depriving
thousands
of
the
means
of
subsistence
and
reducing
to
poverty
many
who
had
been
in
comfortable
circumstances
this
was
oweing
to
the
greed
for
land
on
the
part
of
the
mercantile
classes
who
had
now
acquired
wealth
and
wished
to
become
landed
proprietors

the
bitter
complaints
of
the
sufferers
found
expression
in
bishop
latimer
outspoken
sermon
preached
before
king
edward
in
which
he
said
my
father
was
a
yeoman
small
farmer
and
had
no
lands
of
his
own
only
he
had
a
farm
of
three
or
four
pounds
rent
by
year
and
hereupon
tilled
so
much
as
kept
half
a
dozen
men
he
had
walk
pasture
for
a
hundred
sheep
and
my
mother
milked
thirty
kine
he
was
able
and
did
find
the
king
a
harness
suit
of
armor
with
himself
and
his
horse
until
he
came
to
the
place
where
he
should
receive
the
king
wages
i
can
remember
that
i
buckled
his
harness
when
he
went
into
blackheath
field
he
kept
me
to
school
or
else
i
had
not
been
able
to
have
preached
before
the
king
majesty
now
he
married
my
sisters
with
five
pounds
dower
apiece
he
kept
hospitality
for
his
poor
neighbors
and
some
alms
he
gave
to
the
poor
and
all
this
he
did
off
the
said
farm
where
he
that
now
hath
it
payeth
sixteen
pounds
a
year
or
more
and
is
not
able
to
do
anything
for
his

for
himself
nor
for
his

at

the

were

drawn
up

they
did
not

renewed
the
result
of
this
confiscation
and
of
the
abandonment
of
catholicism
as
the
established
form
of
worship
was
in
certain
respects
disastrous
to
the
country
in
the
general
many
who
had
been
held
in
restraint
by
the
old
form
of
faith
now
went
to
the
other
extreme
and
rejected
all
religion
part
of
the
money
obtained
from
the
sale
of
church
property
was
devoted
mainly
through
edward
influence
to
the
endowment
of
upwards
of
forty
grammar
schools
besides
a
number
of
hospitals
in
different
sections
of

but
for
a
long
time
the
destruction
of

edward

may
be
taken
as
a
representative
macaulay
remarks
that
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
england
received
most
advantage
from
the
roman
catholic
religion
or
from
the
reformation
for
the
union
of
the
saxon
and
norman
races
and
the
abolition
of

she
is
chiefly
indebted
to
the
influence
which
the
priesthood
in
the
middle
ages
exercised
over
the
people
for
political
and
intellectual
freedom
and
for
all
the
blessings
which
they
have
brought
in
their
train
she
owes
the
most
to
the
great
rebellion
of
the

establishment
of

in

and
of

was

was

selfish

who
cared
for

the

philip
soon
found
that
the
air
of
england
had
too
much
freedom
in
it
to
suit
his

constitution
and
he
returned
to
the

directed

was
acceptable
to
a
large

bound
themselves
by

covenant
to
crush
out

parliament
repealed
the

of

so
far
as
it
gave

to
protestantism
she
revived
the
persecuting
statutes
against
heretics
the
old
relations
with

were

but
the
monastic
lands
were
left
in

hands
of

new
owners
to
accomplish

object
in

the
queen
resorted
to
the
arguments
of

in
his
autobiography
benjamin
franklin
says
that
one
of
his
ancestors
who
lived
in
england
in
mary
reign
adopted
the
following
expedient
for
giving
his
family
religious
instruction
he
fastened
an
open
bible
with
strips
of
tape
on
the
under
side
of
a
stool
when
he
wished
to
read
it
aloud
he
placed
the
stool
upside
down
on
his
knees
and
turned
the
pages
under
the
tape
as
he
read
them
one
of
the
children
stood
watching
at
the
door
to
give
the
alarm
if
any
one
approached
in
that
case
the
stool
was
set
quickly
on
its
feet
again
on
the
floor
so
that
nothing
could
be
seen
religious
toleration
unknown
in
mary
age
mary
would
doubtless
have
bravely
endured
for
her
faith
the
full
measure
of
suffering
which
she
inflicted
her
state
of
mind
was
that
of
all
who
then
held
strong
convictions
each
party
believed
it
a
duty
to
convert
or
exterminate
the
other
and
the
alternative
offered
to
the
heretic
was
to
turn
or
burn
sir
thomas
more
who
gave
his
life
as
a
sacrifice
to
conscience
in
henry
reign
was
eager
to
put
tyndale
to
the
torture
for
translating
the
bible
cranmer
who
perished
at
oxford
had
been
zealous
in
sending
to
the
flames
those
who
differed
from
him
even
latimer
who
died
bravely
at
the
stake
exhorting
his
companion
ridley
to
be
of
good
cheer
and
play
the
man
since
they
would
light
such
a
candle
in
england
that
day
as
in
grace
should
not
be
put
out
had
abetted
the
kindling
of
slow
fires
under
men
as
honest
and
determined
as
himself
but
on
the
opposite
side
in
like
spirit
queen
mary
kept
smithfield
london
ablaze
with
martyrs
whose
blood
was
the
seed
of
protestantism
yet
persecution
under
mary
never
reached
the
proportions
that
it
did
on
the
continent
at
the
most
but
a
few
hundred
died
in
england
for
the
sake
of
their
religion
while
mary
husband
philip
ii
during
the
last
of
his
reign
covered
holland
with
the
graves
of
protestants
who
had
been
tortured
and
put
to
cruel
deaths
or
buried
alive
by
tens
of
thousands
mary
death
but
mary
career
was
short
she
died
near
the
close
of
an
inglorious
war
with
france
which
ended
in
the
fall
of
calais
the
last
english
possession
on
the
continent
it
was
a
great
blow
to
her
pride
and
a
serious
humiliation
to
the
country
after
my
death
she
said
you
will
find
calais
written
on
my
heart
could
she
have
foreseen
the
future
her
grief
would
have
been
greater
still
for
with
the
end
of
her
reign
the
pope
lost
all
power
in
england
never
to
regain
it
mary
deserving
of
pity
rather
than
hatred
mary
name
has
come
down
to
us
associated
with
an
epithet
expressive
of
the
utmost
abhorrence
but
she
deserves
pity
rather
than
detestation
froude
justly
says
if
any
person
may
be
excused
for
hating
the
reformation
it
was
mary
separated
from
her
mother
the
unfortunate
catharine
of
aragon
when
she
was
only
sixteen
mary
was
by
henry
new
queen
anne
boleyn
and
hated
by
her
father
thus
the
springtime
of
her
youth
was
blighted
her
marriage
brought
her
no
happiness
sickly
childless
unloved
the
poor
woman
spent
herself
for
naught
her
first
great
mistake
was
that
she
resolutely
turned
her
face
toward
the
past
her
second
that
she
loved
philip
ii
of
spain
with
all
her
heart
soul
and
strength
and
so
out
of
devotion
to
a
bigot
did
a
work
and
earned
that
execration
which
never
fails
to
be
a
bigots
reward
but
the
queen
cruelty
was
the
cruelty
of
sincerity
and
never
like
her
father
hangings
beheadings
and
burnings
the
result
of
tyranny
indifference
or
caprice
a
little
book
of
prayers
which
she
left
soiled
by
constant
use
and
stained
with
many
tears
tells
the
story
of
her
broken
and
disappointed
life
summary
this
reign
should
be
looked
upon
as
a
period
of
reaction
the
temporary
check
which
mary
gave
to
protestantism
deepened
and
strengthened
it
nothing
builds
up
a
religious
faith
like
martyrdom
and
the
next
reign
showed
that
every
heretic
that
mary
had
burned
helped
to
make
at
least
a
hundred
more

scotland
was
divided
between
two
religious
factions
the
catholics
and
the
protestants
and
its
attitude
as
an
independent
kingdom
could
hardly
be
called
friendly
the
catholics
in
the
greater
part
of
ireland
were
in
a
state
bordering
on
rebellion
and
were
ready
to
join
in
any
attack
on
an
english
sovereign
the
religious
problem
but
the
religious
problem
was
more
dangerous
than
any
other
for
england
itself
was
divided
in
its
faith
in
the
north
many
noble
families
stood
by
the
catholic
faith
and
hoped
to
see
the
authority
fully
and
permanently
restored
in
the
towns
of
the
southeast
a
majority
favored
the
church
of
england
as
it
had
been
organized
under
the
protestant
influence
of
edward
vi
see
goldwin
smith
england
within
these
two
great
parties
there
were
two
more
who
made
up
in
zeal
and
determination
what
they
lacked
in
numbers
one
was
the
jesuits
the
other
the
puritans
the
jesuits
were
a
new
roman
catholic
order
banded
together
by
a
solemn
oath
to
restore
the
complete
power
of
the
church
and
to
extend
it
throughout
the
world
openly
or
secretly
their
agents
penetrated
every
country
and
their
opponents
declared
that
they
hesitated
at
nothing
to
gain
their
ends
the
puritans
were
the
extreme
protestants
who
like
john
calvin
of
geneva
and
john
knox
of
edinburgh
were
bent
on
cleansing
or
purifying
the
reformed
faith
from
every
vestige
of
catholicism
many
of
them
were
what
the
rack
and
the
stake
had
naturally
made
them
hard
fearless
narrow
bitter
in
scotland
the
puritans
had
got
possession
of
the
government
while
in
england
they
were
steadily
gaining
ground
they
were
ready
to
recognize
the
queen
as
head
of
the
church
of
england
they
even
wished
that
all
persons
should
be
compelled
to
worship
as
the
government
prescribed
but
they
protested
against
what
they
considered
the
halfway
form
of
church
which
elizabeth
and
the
bishops
seemed
inclined
to
maintain
the
queen
choice
of
counselors
elizabeth
policy
from
the
beginning
was
one
of
compromise
in
order
to
conciliate
the
catholic
party
she
retained
eleven
of
her
sister
mary
counselors
but
she
added
to
them
sir
william
cecil
lord
burghley
who
was
her
chief
adviser
sir
nicholas
bacon
and
later
sir
francis
walsingham
with
others
who
were
favorable
to
the
protestant
faith
see
macaulay
essay
on
lord
burghley
on
his
appointment
elizabeth
said
to
cecil
this
judgment
i
have
of
you
that
you
will
not
be
corrupted
with
any
gifts
that
you
will
be
faithful
to
the
state
and
that
without
respect
to
my
private
will
you
give
me
that
counsel
which
you
think
best
cecil
served
the
queen
until
his
death
forty
years
afterward
the
almost
implicit
obedience
with
which
elizabeth
followed
his
advice
sufficiently
proves
that
cecil
was
the
real
power
not
only
behind
but
generally
above
the
throne
the
coronation
the
bishops
were
roman
catholics
and
elizabeth
found
it
difficult
to
get
one
to
perform
the
coronation
services
at
length
one
consented
but
only
on
condition
that
the
queen
should
take
the
ancient
form
of
coronation
oath
by
which
she
virtually
bound
herself
to
support
the
roman
catholic
church
to
this
elizabeth
consented
and
having
consulted
an
astrologer
dee
he
named
a
lucky
day
for
the
ceremony
and
she
was
crowned
by
this
oath
every
english
sovereign
from
william
the
conqueror
to
elizabeth
inclusive
and
even
as
late
as
james
ii
with
the
single
exception
of
edward
vi
swore
to
preserve
religion
in
the
same
state
as
did
edward
the
confessor
the
form
of
the
coronation
oath
was
changed
to
support
protestantism
by
the
revolution
of
finally
under
george
v
in
the
phraseology
of
the
oath
was
modified
by
act
of
parliament
in
order
to
make
it
less
objectionable
not
only
to
english
catholics
but
to
a
large
majority
of
the
people
of
the
nation
changes
in
the
church
service
the
late
queen
mary
besides
having
repealed
the
legislation
of
the
two
preceding
reigns
in
so
far
as
it
was
opposed
to
her
own
strong
religious
convictions
had
restored
the
roman
catholic
latin
prayer
book
at
elizabeth
coronation
a
petition
was
presented
stating
that
it
was
the
custom
to
release
a
certain
number
of
prisoners
on
such
occasions
the
petitioners
therefore
begged
her
majesty
to
set
at
liberty
the
four
evangelists
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
and
also
the
apostle
paul
who
had
been
for
some
time
shut
up
in
a
strange
language
the
english
book
of
common
prayer
with
some
slight
changes
was
accordingly
reinstated
parliament
repealed
the
laws
by
which
the
late
queen
mary
had
practically
restored
the
roman
catholic
religion
and
it
authorized
the
publication
of
a
new
and
revised
edition
of
the
english
bible
new
act
of
supremacy
act
of
uniformity
high
commission
court
no
sooner
was
the
queen
accession
announced
to
the
pope
than
he
declared
her
illegitimate
and
ordered
her
to
lay
aside
her
crown
and
submit
herself
to
his
guidance
such
a
demand
was
a
signal
for
battle
however
much
attached
a
large
part
of
the
nation
especially
the
country
people
may
have
been
to
the
catholic
religion
of
their
fathers
yet
the
majority
of
them
were
loyal
to
the
queen
and
intended
to
stand
by
her
the
temper
of
parliament
manifested
itself
in
the
immediate
reenactment
of
the
act
of
supremacy
it
way
essentially
the
same
though
with
its
edge
a
little
blunted
as
that
by
which
henry
viii
had
freed
england
from
the
dominion
of
the
pope
it
declared
elizabeth
not
supreme
head
but
supreme
governor
of
the
church
later
the
act
was
made
more
stringent
to
this
act
every
member
of
the
house
of
commons
was
obliged
to
subscribe
thus
all
catholics
were
exclued
from
that
body
the
lords
however
not
being
an
elective
body
were
excused
from
the
obligation
at
that
time
in
order
to
enforce
the
act
of
supremacy
parliament
passed
a
new
act
of
uniformity
which
ordered
the
minister
of
every
congregation
in
england
whether
catholic
or
protestant
to
use
the
services
laid
down
in
the
recently
established
book
of
common
prayer
and
to
use
no
other
in
fact
the
law
forbade
the
holding
of
any
other
service
even
in
a
room
with
closed
doors
in
case
he
failed
to
obey
this
law
he
would
be
severely
punished
and
for
a
third
offense
would
be
imprisoned
for
life
the
same
act
imposed
a
heavy
fine
on
all
persons
who
failed
to
attend
the
established
church
of
england
on
sundays
and
holidays
the
reason
for
these
stringent
measures
was
that
in
that
age
church
and
state
were
everywhere
considered
to
be
inseparable
no
country
in
europe
not
even
protestant
germany
could
then
conceive
the
idea
of
their
existing
independently
of
each
other
whoever
refused
to
support
the
established
form
of
worship
whatever
that
might
be
was
looked
upon
as
a

the
religious
belief
of
the
english
church
which
had
been
first
formulated
under
edward
vi
was
revised
and
reduced
to
the
articles
which
constitute
it
at
the
present
time
but
the
real
value
of
the
religious
revolution
which
was
taking
place
did
not
lie
in
the
substitution
of
one
creed
for
another
but
in
the
new
spirit
of
inquiry
and
the
new
freedom
of
thought
which
that
change
awakened
but
the

act
simply
requires
the
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
to
make
a
general
declaration
of
assent
to
the

and
the

book
as
for
elizabeth
herself
she
seems
to
have
had
no
deep
and
abiding
convictions
on
these
matters
her
political
interests
practically
compelled
her
to
favor
protestantism
but
to
the
end
of
her
life
she
kept
up
some
catholic
forms
though
she
upheld
the
service
of
the
church
of
england
yet
she
shocked
the
puritans
by
keeping
a
crucifix
with
lighted
candles
in
front
of
it
hung
in
her
private
chapel
before
which
she
prayed
to
the
virgin
as
fervently
as
her
sister
mary
had
ever
done
the
nation
halting
between
two
opinions
in
this
double
course
she
represented
a
large
part
of
the
nation
which
hesitated
about
committing
itself
fully
to
either
side
men
were
not

who
were
ready
to
lay
down

have

though
there
was
nothing
morally
noble
in

halting

facing
both
ways
yet
it
saved
england
for

time

of

the
question
of
the
queen
marriage
elizabeth
showed
the
same
tact
with
regard
to
marriage
that
she
did
with
regard
to
religion
her
first
parliament
realizing
that
the
welfare
of
the
country
depended
largely
on
whom
the
queen
should
marry
begged
her
to
consider
the
question
of
taking
a
husband
her
reply
was
that
she
had
resolved
to
live
and
die
a
maiden
queen
when
further
pressed
she
returned
answers
that
like
the
ancient
greek
oracles
might
be
interpreted
either
way
the
truth
was
that
elizabeth
saw
the
difficult
of
her
position
better
than
any
one
else
the
choice
opf
her
heart
at
that
time
would
probably
have
been
robert
dudley
her
sweet
robin
the
handsome
but
unscrupulous
earl
of
leicester
but
as
he
called
himself
a
protestant
she
knew
that
to
take
him
as
consort
would
be
to
incur
the
enmity
of
the
catholic
powers
of
europe
on
the
other
hand
if
she
accepted
a
catholic
she
would
inevitably
alienate
a
large
and
influential
number
of
her
own
subjects
in
this
delimma
she
resolved
to
keep
both
sides
in
a
state
of
hopeful
expectation
philip
ii
of
spain
who
had
married
her
sister
mary
made
overtures
to
elizabeth
she
kept
him
waiting
in
uncertainty
until
at
last
his
ambassador
lost
all
patience
and
declared
that
the
queen
was
possessed
with
ten
thousand
demons
later
the
duke
of
anjou
a
son
of
henry
ii
of
france
proposed
he
was
favorably
received
but
the
country
became
so
alarmed
at
the
prospect
of
having
a
catholic
king
that
stubbs
a
puritan
lawyer
published
a
coarse
and
violent
pamphlet
denouncing
the
marriage
for
this
attack
his
right
hand
was
cut
off
as
it
fell
says
an
eyewitness
he
seized
his
hat
with
the
other
hand
and
waved
it
shouting
god
save
queen
elizabeth
that
act
was
an
index
to
the
popular
feeling
a
majority
of
the
people
whether
catholics
or
protestants
stood
by
the
crown
even
when
they
condemned
its
policy
determined
at
all
hazards
to
preserve
the
unity
of
the
nation
that
spirit
of
intense
loyalty
and
love
of
country
without
regard
to
creed
or
calling
found
perfect
expression
in
shakespeare
utterance
this
england
never
did
nor
never
shall
lie
at
the
proud
foot
of
a
conqueror
come
the
three
corners
of
the
world
in
arms
and
we
shall
shock
them
nought
shall
make
us
rue
if
england
to
itself
do
but
rest
true
we
shall
see
that
this
feeling
showed
itself
still
more
unmistakably
when
years
later
men
of
all
classes
and
of
widely
different
religious
views
rose
to
destroy
the

that
great
fleet
which
spain
sent

is
likely
to
be
swallowed

robsart
see
the

elizabeth
vanity
was

as
it
was
ludicrous
she
issued
a
proclamation
forbidding
any
one
to
sell
her
picture
lest
it
should
fail
to
do
her
justice
she
was
greedy
of
flattery
even
when
long
past
sixty
and
there
was
a
sting
of
truth
in
the
letter
which
mary
queen
of
scots
wrote
her
saying
your
aversion
to

proceeds
from
your
not
wishing
to
lose
the
liberty
of
compelling
people
to
make

to
you
violence
of
temper
crooked
policy
in
temper
elizabeth
was
arbitrary
fickle
and
passionate
when
her
blood
was
up
she
would

like
a
trooper

she
wrote
abusive

even

letters
to

and
she

insulted
the
wife
of

because
she
did
not
believe
in
a
married
clergy
for
the
famous
letter
to
the
bishop
of
ely
attributed
to
elizabeth
see
hallam
constitutional
history
of
england
froude
or
creighton
but
the
dictionary
of
national
biography
elizabeth
calls
it
a
forgery
the
age
in
which
elizabeth
reigned
was
preeminently
one
of
craft
and
intrigue
the
kings
of
that
day
endeavored
to
get
by
fraud
what
their
less
polished
predecessors
got
by
force
at
this
game
of
double
dealing
elizabeth
had
few
equals
and
no
superior
so
profound
was
her
dissimulation
that
her
most
confidential
advisers
never
felt
quite
sure
that
she
was
not
deceiving
them
in
her
diplomatic
relations
she
never
hesitated
at
an
untruth
if
it
would
serve
her
purpose
and
when
the
falsehood
was
discovered
she
always
had
another
and
more
plausible
one
ready
to
take
its
place
in
all
this
her
devotion
to
england
stands
out
unquestioned
and
justifies
the
saying
she
lived
and
lied
for
her
country
her
knowledge
of
men
the
monopolies
the
queen
real
ability
lay
in
her
instinctive
perception
of
the
needs
of
the
age
and
in
her
power
of
to
them
elizabeth
never
made
public
opinion
but
watched
it
and
followed
it
she
knew
an
able
man
at
sight
and
had
the
happy
faculty
of
attaching
such
men
to
her
service
by
nature
she
was
both
irresolute
and
impulsive
but
her
sense
was
good
and
her
judgment
clear
she
could
tell
when
she
was
well
advised
and
although
she
fumed
and
blustered
she
yielded
it
has
been
said
that
the
next
best
thing
to
having
a
good
rule
is
to
know
when
to
break
it
elizabeth
always
knew
when
to
change
her
policy
no
matter
how
obstinate
she
was
she
saw
the
point
where
obstinacy
became
dangerous
in
order
to
enrich
raleigh
and
her
numerous
other
favorites
she
granted
them
the
exclusive
right
to
deal
in
certain
articles
these
privileges
were
called
monopolies
they
finally
came
to
comprise
almost
everything
that
could
be
bought
or
sold
from
french
wines
to
secondhand
shoes
the
effect
was
to
raise
prices
so
as
to
make
even
the
common
necessaries
of
life
excessively
dear
a
great
outcry
finally
arose
parliament
requested
the
queen
to
abolish
the
monopolies
she
hesitated
but
when
she
saw
their
determined
attitude
she
gracefully
granted
the
ptition
the
adulation
of
the
court
no
english
sovereign
was
so
popular
or
so
praised

great
writers
and

their
compliments
to
elizabeth
beauty

she
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
splendor

of

reign
was
full
of

transformation
once

stone
fortress
built
for

but
now
that
the
wars
of
the
roses
had
destroyed
the
old
feudal
barons
there
was
no
need
of
such
precaution
men
were
no

content
to
live
shut
up
in
somber
strongholds
surrounded
with
moats
of
stagnant
water
or
in
meanly
built
houses

the
smoke
curled

perhaps
the
most
formidable
of
these
was
the
effort
which
mary
stuart
queen
of
scots
made
to
supplant
her
english
rival
shortly
after
elizabeth
accession
mary

she

it
was

that

married
were
guilty
of

elizabeth
fearing

might

and
stir
up

confined
her
in
bolton
castle
yorkshire
during
her
imprisonment
in
another
stronghold
to
which
she
had
been
transferred
she
was
accused
of
being
implicated
in
a
plot
for
assassinating
the
english
queen
and
seizing
the
reins
of
government
in
behalf
of
herself
and
the
jesuits
it
was
in
fact
a
time
when
the
protestant
faith
seemed
everywhere
marked
for
destruction
in
france
evil
counselors
had
induced
the
king
to
order
a
massacre
of
the
reformers
and
on
batholomew
day
thousands
were
slain

misinformed
in

william
the
silent
who
had
driven
out
the
catholics
from
a
part
of
the

had
been
assassinated

fanatic
meanwhile
the

had
excommunicated

from

to

a
fanatic
nailed

of

door
of

this
bold
act
for
which
the
offender
suffered

brought
matters
to
a
crisis
englishmen
felt
that
they
could
no
longer
remain
halting
between
two
opinions
they
realized
that
now
they
must
resolve
to
take
their
stand
by

or
else
by

parliament
at
once
retaliated
against
the
pope
by
passing
two
stringent
measures
which
declared
it
high
treason
for
any
one
to
deny
the
queen
right
to
the
crown
to
name
her
successor
to
denounce
her
as
a
heretic
or
to
say
or
do
anything
which
should
alienate
the
hearts
and
minds
of
her
subjects
from
their
dutiful
obedience
to
her
later
the
association
a
vigilance
committee
was
formed
by
a
large
number
of
the
principal
people
of
the
realm
to
protect
elizabeth
against
assassination
not
only
prominent
protestants
but
many
catholic
noblemen
joined
the
organization
to
defend
the
queen
at
all
hazards
elizabeth
beheads
mary
the
ominous
significance
of
these
events
had
their
full
effect
on
the
english
queen
aroused
to
a
sense
of
her
danger
she
signed
the
scottish
queen
death
warrant
and
mary
after
nineteen
imprisonment
was
beheaded
at

demolished
by
james
i
as
soon
as
the
news
of
her
execution
was
brought
to
elizabeth
she
became
alarmed
at
the
political
consequences
the
act
might
have
in
europe
with
her
usual
duplicity
she
bitterly
upbraided
the
minister
who
had
advised
it
and
throwing
davidson
her
secretary
into
the
tower
fined
him
pounds
the
payment
of
which
reduced
him
to
beggary
not
satisfied
with
this
elizabeth
even
had
the
effrontery
to
write
a
letter
of
condolence
to
mary
son
james
vi
declaring
that
his
mother
had
been
beheaded
by
mistake
yet
facts
prove
that
elizabeth
had
not
only
determined
to
put
mary
to
death
but
that
she
had
urged
those
who
held
mary
prisoner
to
kill
her
privately

when
a
new
and

danger
threatened
the
country
at

death
the
scottish
queen
disgusted
with
her

james
bequeathed
her
dominions

powerful

equal
to

had
deserted

and
accepted
a
pension
from

with
the
encouragement
of

he
sailed
there
and
in
spite
of
all
opposition
effectually
singed
the
spanish
king
beard
as
he
said
by
burning
and
otherwise
destroying
more
than
a
hundred
ships
this
so
crippled
the

given
up

the
date
of
the
defeat
of

was
a
turning
point
in
english
history
from
that
time
england
gradually
rose
under
the
leadership
of
such
illustrious
commanders
as
drake
blake
and
nelson
until
she
became
what
she
has
ever
since
remained

greatest

power
in
the
world
insurrection
in
ireland
a
few
years
later
a
terrible
rebellion
broke
out
in
ireland
from
its
partial
conquest
in
the
time
of
henry
ii
the
condition
of
that
island
continued
to
be
deplorable
first
the
chiefs
of
the
native
tribes
fought
constantly
among
themselves
next
the
english
attempted
to
force
the
protestant
religion
upon
a
people
who
detested
it
lastly
the
greed
and
misgovernment
of
the
rulers
put
a
climax
to
these
miseries
sir
walter
raleigh
said
the
country
was
a
commonwealth
of
common
woe
what
made
this
state
of
things
still
more
dangerous
was
the
fact
that
the
catholic
rulers
of
spain
considered
the
irish
as
their
natural
allies
and
were
plotting
to
send
troops
to
that
island
in
order
to
strike
england
a
deadly
side
blow
when
she
least
expected
it
elizabeth
government
began
a
war
the
object
of
which
was
not
to
subdue
but
to
destroy
the
extermination
was
so
merciless
that
the
queen
herself
declared
that
if
the
work
of
destruction
went
on
much
longer
she
should
have
nothing
left
but
ashes
and
corpses
to
rule
over
then
but
not
till
then
the
starving
remnant
of
the
irish
people
submitted
and
england
gained
a
barren
victory
which
has
ever
since
carried
with
it
its
own
curse
the
first
poor
law
in
elizabeth
reign
the
first
effective
english
poor
law
was
passed
it
required
each
parish
to
make
provision
for
such
paupers
as
were
unable
to
work
while
the
were
compelled
to
labor
for
their
own
support
this
measure
relieved
much
of
the
distress
which
had
prevailed
during
the
three
previous
reigns
and
forms
the
basis
of
the
law
in
force
at
the
present
time
elizabeth
death
the
death
of
the
great
queen
was
as
sad
as
her
life
had
been
brilliant
her
favorite
essex
shakespeare
intimate
friend
had
been
beheaded
for
an
attempted
rebellion
against
her
power
from
that
time
she
grew
as
she
said
her
old
friends
and
counselors
were
dead
her
people
no
longer
welcomed
her
with
their
former
enthusiasm
she
kept
a
sword
always
within
reach
treason
had
grown
so
common
that
hentzner
a
german
traveler
in
england
said
that
he
counted
three
hundred
heads
of
persons
who
had
suffered
death
for
this
crime
exposed
on
london
bridge
elizabeth
felt
that
her
sun
was
nearly
set
gradually
her
strength
declined
she
ceased
to
leave
her
palace
and
sat
muttering
to
herself
all
day
long
mortua
sed
non
sepulta
dead
but
not
buried
at
length
she
lay
propped
up
on
cushions
on
the
floor
tired
as
she
said
of
reigning
and
tired
of
life
in
that
sullen
mood
she
departed
to
join
that
silent
majority
whose
realm
under
earth
is
bounded
by
the
sides
of
the
grave
four
days
afterward
says
a
writer
of
that
time
she
was
forgotten

still

were

retained

its

styled

but
the
term
great
britain
did
not
properly
come
into
use
until
somewhat
more
than
a
hundred
years
later
when
by
an
act
of
parliament
under
anne
scotland
and
england
were
legally
united
the
english
parliament
refused
to
grant
free
trade
to
scotland
and
denied
to
the
people
of
that
counttry

if
born

came

throne
or

as
they
were
called

and

the
king
appearances
and
character
james
was
unfortunate
in
his
birth
neither
his
father
lord
darnley
nor
his
mother
had
high
qualities
of
character
the
murder
of
italian
secretary
in
her
own
palace
and
almost
in
her
own
presence
gave
the
queen
a
shock
which
left
a
fatal
inheritance
of
cowardice
to
her
son
throughout
his
life
he
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
a
drawn
sword
if
we
can
trust
common
report
his
personal
appearance
was
by
no
means
impressive
he
had
a
feeble
rickety
body
he
could
not
walk
straight
his
tongue
was
too
large
for
his
mouth
and
he
had
goggle
eyes
through
fear
of
assassination
he
habitually
wore
thickly
padded
and
quilted
clothes
usually
green
in
color
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
shrewdness
but
of
a
small
mind
and
of
unbounded
conceit
his
scotch
tutor
had
crammed
him
with
much
learning
so
that
he
gave
the
impression
of
a
man
educated
beyond
his
intellect
his
favorites
used
to
flatter
him
by
telling
him
that
he
was
the
british
solomon
but
the
french
ambassador
came
nearer
to
the
mark
when
he
called
him
the
wisest
fool
in
christendom
the
king
wrote
on
witchcraft
kingcraft
and
theology
and
composed
numerous
commonplace
verses
he
also
wrote
a
sweeping
denunciation
of
the
new
plant
called
tobacco
which
raleigh
had
brought
from
america
and
whose
smoke
now
began
to
perfume
or
according
to
james
to
poison
the
air
of
england
his
majesty
had
all
the
superstitions
of
the
age
and
one
of
his
earliest
acts
was
the
passage
of
a
statute
punishing
witchcraft
with
death
under
that
law
many
a
wretched
woman
perished
on
the
scaffold
whose
only
crime
was
that
she
was
old
ugly
and
friendless
the
great
puritan
petition
during
the
latter
part
of
elizabeth
reign
the
puritans
in
england
had
increased
so
rapidly
that
archbishop
whitgift
told
james
he
was
amazed
to
find
how
the
vipers
had
multiplied
the
puritans
felt
that
the
reformation
had
not
been
sufficiently
thorough
they
complained
that
many
of
the
forms
and
ceremonies
of
the
church
of
engalnd
were
by
no
means
in
harmony
with
the
scriptures
many
of
them
wished
also
to
change
the
episcopal
form
of
church
government
and
instead
of
having
bishops
appointed
by
the
king
to
adopt
the
more
democratic
method
of
having
presbyters
or
elders
chosen
by
the
congregation
while
james
was
on
the
way
from
scotland
to
london
to
receive
the
crown
the
puritans
presented
the
millenary
petition
to
him
it
was
so
called
because
it
purported
to
have
a
thousand
signers
the
ministers
presenting
it
asked
that
they
might
be
permitted
to
preach
without
wearing
the
white
gown
called
a
surplice
to
baptize
without
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
the
child
forehead
and
to
perform
the
marriage
ceremony
without
using
the
ring
bishop
hooker
and
lord
bacon
had
pleaded
for
a
certain
degree
of
toleration
for
the
puritans
they
even
quoted
the
words
of
christ
he
that
is
not
against
us
is
for
us
but
the
king
had
no
patience
with
such
a
plea
hampton
court
conference
the
king
convened
a
conference
at
hampton
court
near
london
to
consider
the
petition
or
rather
to
make
a
pedantic
display
of
his
own
learning
the
probability
that
he
would
grant
the
request
was
small
james
had
come
to
england
disgusted
with
the
violence
of
the
scotch
presbyterians
or
puritans
especially
since
andrew
melville
one
of
their
leading
ministers
in
edinburgh
had
seized
his
sleeve
at
a
public
meeting
and
addressed
him
with
a
somewhat
brutal
excess
of
truth
as
god
silly
vassal
gardiner
in
the
dictionary
of
national
british
biography
james
i
thinks
that
by
silly
melville
meant
weak
but
that
is
not
much
improvement
but
the
new
sovereign
had
a
still
deeper
reason
for
his
antipathy
to
the
puritans
he
saw
that
their
doctrine
of
equality
in
the
church
naturally
led
to
that
equality
in
the
state
if
they
objected
to
episcopal
government
in
the
one
might
they
not
presently
object
to
royal
government
in
the
other
hence
to
all
their
arguments
he
answered
with
his
favorite
maxim
no
bishop
no
king
meaning
that
the
two
must
stand
or
fall
together
at
the
hampton
court
conference
all
real
freedom
of
discussion
was
practically
prohibited
the
conference
however
had
one
good
result
for
the
king
ordered
a
new
and
revised
translation
of
the
bible
to
be
made
it
was
published
a
few
years
later
this
translation
of
the
scriptures
excels
all
others
in
simplicity
dignity
and
beauty
of
language
after
more
than
three
hundred
years
it
still
remains
the
version
used
in
the
great
majority
of
protestant
churches
and
protestant
homes
wherever
english
is
spoken
james
regarded
the
conference
as
a
success
he
had
refuted
the
puritans
as
he
believed
with
much
latin
and
some
greek
he
ended
by
declaiming
against
them
with
such
unction
that
one
enthusiastic
bishop
declared
that
his
majesty
must
be
specially
inspired
by
the
holy
ghost
he
closed
the
meeting
by
imprisoning
the
ten
persons
who
had
presented
the
petition
on
the
ground
that
it
tended
to
sedition
and
rebellion
henceforth
the
king
attitude
toward
the
puritans
was
unmistakable
i
will
make
them
conform
said
he
or
i
will
harry
them
out
of
the
land
accordingly
a
law
was
enacted
which
required
every
curate
to
accept
the
articles
and
the
prayer
book
of
the
church
of
england
without
reservation
this
act
drove
several
hundred
clergymen
from
the
established
church
the
divine
right
of
kings
the
protest
of
the
commons
favorites
as
if
with
the
desire
of
further
alienating
his
people
james
now
constantly
proclaimed
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
this
theory
which
was
unknown
to
the
english
constitution
declared
that
the
king
derived
his
power
and
right
to
rule
directly
from
god
and
in
no
way
from
the
people
it
is
atheism
and
blasphemy
he
said
to
dispute
what
god
can
do
so
it
is
presumption
and
high
contempt
in
a
subject
to
dispute
what
a
king
can
do
james
favorite
saying
was
a
deo
rex
a
rege
lex
god
makes
the
king
the
king
makes
the
law
he
boasted
that
kings
might
as
he
declared
make
what
liked
them
law
and
gospel
in
making
these
utterances
james
seems
to
have
entirely
forgotten
that
he
owed
his
throne
to
that
act
of
the
english
parliament
which
accepted
him
as
elizabeth
successor
in
his
exalted
position
as
head
of
the
nation
he
boasted
of
his
power
much
like
the
dwarf
in
the
story
who
perched
on
the
giant
shoulders
cries
out
see
how
big
i
am
acting
on
this
assumption
james
levied
customs
duties
on
goods
without
asking
the
consent
of
parliament
violated
the
privileges
of
the
house
of
commons
rejected
members
who
had
been
legally
elected
and
imprisoned
those
who
dared
to
criticize
his
course
the
contest
was
kept
up
with
bitterness
during
the
whole
reign
toward
its
close
james
truckled
meanly
to
the
power
of
spain
hoping
thereby
to
marry
his
son
charles
to
a
spanish
princess
later
he
made
a
feeble
and
futile
effort
to
help
the
protestant
party
in
the
great
thirty
years
war
which
had
begun
between
the
catholics
and
protestants
in
germany
the
house
of
commons
implored
the
king
not
to
humiliate
himself
and
the
nation
at
the
feet
of
spain
the
king
replied
by
warning
the
house
not
to
meddle
with
matters
which
did
not
concern
them
and
denied
their
right
to
freedom
of
speech
the
commons
solemnly
protested
and
james
seized
their
official
journal
and
with
his
own
hands
tore
out
the
record
of
the
protest
yet
notwithstanding
his
arbitrary
character
james
was
easily
managed
by
those
who
would
flatter
his
vanity
for
this
reason
he
was
always
under
the
control
of
worthless
favorites
like
carr
earl
of
somerset
or
villiers
duke
of
buckingham
these
men
were
the
secret
power
behind
the
throne
and
they
often
dictated
the
policy
of
the
crown
the
gunpowder
plot
the
king
arbitrary
spirit
angered
the
house
of
commons
many
of
whom
were
puritans
they
believed
that
the
king
secretly
favored
the
roman
catholics
and
for
this
reason
they
increased
the
stringency
of
the
laws
against
persons
of
that
religion
to
vindicate
himself
from
this
suspicion
the
king
proceeded
to
execute
the
new
statutes
with
rigor
as
a
rule
the
catholic
were
loyal
subjects
we
have
seen
that
when
spain
threatened
to
invade
the
country
they
fought
as
valiantly
in
its
defense
as
the
protestants
themselves
many
of
them
were
now
ruined
by
enormous
fines
while
the
priests
were
driven
from
the
realm
one
of
the
sufferers
by
these
unjust
measures
was
robert
catesby
a
catholic
gentleman
of
good
position
he
with
the
aid
of
a
yorkshire
man
named
guy
fawkes
and
about
a
dozen
more
formed
a
plot
to
blow
up
the
parliament
house
on
the
day
the
king
was
to
open
the
session
november
their
intention
after
they
had
thus
summarily
disposed
of
the
government
was
to
induce
the
catholics
to
rise
and
proclaim
a
new
sovereign
the
plot
was
discovered
the
conspirators
were
executed
and
the
catholics
treated
with
greater
severity
than
ever
american
colonies
virginia
a
london
company
of
merchants
and
adventurers
or
speculators
established
the
first
permanent
english
colony
in
america
on
the
coast
of
virginia
in
at
a
place
which
they
called
jamestown
in
honor
of
the
king
see
map
facing
p
the
colony
was
wholly
under
the
control
of
the
crown
the
religion
was
to
be
that
of
the
church
of
england
most
of
those
who
went
out
were
described
as
gentlemen
that
is
persons
not
brought
up
to
manual
labor
fortunately
the
eneergy
and
determined
courage
of
captain
john
smith
who
was
the
real
soul
of
the
enterprise
saved
it
from
miserable
failure
negro
slavery
which
in
those
days
touched
no
man
conscience
was
introduced
and
by
its
means
great
quantities
of
tobacco
were
raised
for
export
the
settlement
grew
in
population
and
wealth
and
at
the
end
of
twelve
years
it
had
secured
the
privilege
of
making
its
own
local
laws
thus
becoming
practically
a
community
the
pilgrims
the
new
power
the
year
after
the
virginia
legislature
was
established
another
band
of
emigrants
went
out
from
england
not
west
but
east
not
to
seek
prosperity
but
greater
religious
freedom
james
declaration
that
he
would
make
all
men
conform
to
the
established
church
or
drive
them
out
of
the
land
was
having
its
due
effect
those
who
continued
to
refuse
to
conform
were
fined
cast
into
filthy
prisons
beaten
and
often
half
starved
so
that
the
old
and
feeble
soon
died
strange
to
say
this
kind
of
treatment
did
not
win
over
the
puritans
to
the
side
of
the
bishops
and
the
king
on
the
contrary
it
set
many
of
them
to
thinking
more
seriously
than
ever
of
the
true
relations
of
the
government
to
religion
the
result
was
that
not
a
few
came
to
the
conclusion
that
each
body
of
christians
had
the
right
to
form
a
religious
society
of
its
own
wholly
independent
of
the
state
that
branch
of
the
puritans
who
held
this
opinion
got
the
name
of
independents
or
separatists
because
they
were
determined
to
separate
from
the
established
church
of
england
and
conduct
their
worship
and
govern
their
religious
societies
as
they
deemed
best
in
the
little
village
of
scrooby
nottinghamshire
see
map
opposite
postmaster
william
brewster
william
bradford
john
carver
and
some
others
mostly
farmers
and
poor
men
of
the
neighborhood
had
organized
an
independent
religious
society
with
john
robinson
for
its
minister
after
a
time
they
became
convinced
that
so
long
as
they
remained
in
england
they
could
never
be
safe
from
persecution
they
therefore
resolved
to
leave
their
native
country
they
could
not
get
a
royal
license
to
go
to
america
and
for
this
reason
they
emigrated
to
holland
where
all
men
were
free
to
establish
societies
for
the
worship
of
god
in
their
own
manner
with
much
difficulty
and
danger
they
managed
to
escape
to
that
country
after
remaining
in
holland
about
twelve
years
a
part
of
them
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
king
james
the
privilege
of
emigrating
to
america
a
london
trading
company
which
was
sending
out
an
expedition
for
fish
and
furs
agreed
to
furnish
the
pilgrims
passage
by
the
mayflower
though
on
terms
so
hard
that
the
poor
exiles
said
the
conditions
were
fitter
for
thieves
and
bondslaves
than
for
honest
men
see
why
did
the
pilgrim
fathers
come
to
new
england
by
edwin
mead
in
the
new
englander
xli
these
pilgrims
or
wanderers
set
forth
in
for
that
new
world
beyond
the
sea
which
they
hoped
would
redress
the
wrongs
of
the
old
landing
at
plymouth
in
massachusetts
they
established
a
colony
on
the
basis
of
equal
laws
for
the
general
good
ten
years
later
john
winthrop
a
puritan
gentleman
of
wealth
from
groton
suffolk
see

followed
with
a
large
number
of
emigrants
and
settled
boston
during
the
next
decade
no
less
than
twenty
thousand
englishmen
found
a
home
in
america
but
to
the
little
band
that
embarked
under
bradford
and
brewster
in
the
mayflower
the
scene
of
whose
landing
at
plymouth
is
painted
on
the
walls
of
the
houses
of
parliament
belongs
the
first
credit
of
the
great
undertaking
of
that
enterprise
one
of
their
brethren
in
england
wrote
in
the
time
of
their
severest
distress
with
prophetic
foresight
let
it
not
be
grievous
to
you
that
you
have
been
instruments
to
break
the
ice
for
others
the
honor
shall
be
yours
to
the
world
end
from
this
time
forward
the
american
coast
south
of
the
bay
of
fundy
was
settled
mainly
by
english
emigrants
and
in
the
course
of
a
little
more
than
a
century
the
total
number
of
colonies
had
reached
thirteen
thus
the
nation
of
great
britain
was
beginning
to
expand
into
that
britain
which
it
had
discovered
and
planted
beyond
the
sea
meanwhile
a
new
power
had
arisen
in
england
it
was
mightier
even
than
that
of
kings
because
greater
for
both
good
and
evil
its
influence
grew
up
very
gradually
it
was
part
of
the
fruit
of
caxton
work
undertaken
nearly
two
centuries
earlier
this
power
appeared
in
the
spring
of
under
the
name
of
the
the
first
regular
newspaper
the
colonization
of
ireland
while
the
colonization
of
america
was
going
on
king
james
was
himself
planning
a
very
different
kind
of
colony
in
the
northeast
of
ireland
the
greater
part
of
the
province
of
ulster
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
rebellion
under
elizabeth
had
been
seized
by
the
crown
the
king
now
granted
these
lands
to
settlers
from
scotland
and
england
the
city
of
london
founded
a
colony
which
they
called
londonderry
and
by
this
means
protestantism
was
firmly
and
finally
established
in
the
north
of
the
island
the
addled
parliament
the
new
stand
taken
by
the
house
of
commons
the
house
of
commons
at
this
period
began
to
slowly
recover
the
power
it
had
lost
under
the
tudors
james
suffered
from
a
chronic
lack
of
money
he
was
obliged
to
apply
to
parliament
to
supply
his
wants
but
that
body
was
determined
to
grant
nothing
without
reforms
it
laid
down
the
principle
to
which
it
firmly
adhered
that
the
king
should
not
have
the
nation
coin
unless
he
would
promise
to
right
the
nation
wrongs
after
several
weeks
of
angry
discussion
the
king
dissolved
what
was
nicknamed
the
addled
parliament
because
its
enemies
accused
it
of
having
accomplished
nothing
in
reality
it
had
accomplished
much
for
though
it
had
not
passed
a
single
bill
it
had
shown
by
its
determined
attitude
the
growing
stregnth
of
the
people
for
the
next
seven
years
james
ruled
without
summoning
a
parliament
in
order
to
obtain
means
to
support
his
army
in
ireland
the
king
created
a
new
title
of
rank
that
of
baronet
which
he
granted
to
any
one
who
would
pay
liberally
for
it
as
a
last
resort
to
get
funds
he
compelled
all
persons
having
an
income
of
forty
pounds
or
more
a
year
derived
from
landed
property
to
accept
knighthood
thus
incurring
feudal
obligations
and
payments
or
purchase
exemption
by
a
heavy
fine
baronet
this
title
note
does
not
confer
the
right
to
a
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
a
baronet
is
designated
as
sir
sir
john
franklin
this
exaction
was
ridiculed
by
the
wits
of
the
time
in
these
lines
he
that
hat
forty
pounds
per
annum
shall
be
promoted
from
the
plow
his
wife
shall
take
the
wall
of
her
honor
sold
so
now
the
distraint
of
knighthood
as
it
was
called
began
at
least
as
far
back
as
edward
i
precedence
of
her
grandmother
impeachment
of
lord
bacon
when
james
did
finally
summon
a
parliament
it
met
in
a
stern
mood
the
house
of
commons
impeached
lord
bacon
for
having
taken
bribes
in
lawsuits
tried
before
him
as
judge
the
house
of
lords
convicted
him
he
confessed
the
crime
but
pleaded
extenuating
circumstances
adding
i
beseech
your
lordships
to
be
merciful
unto
a
broken
reed
but
bacon
had
been
in
every
respect
a
servile
tool
of
james
and
no
mercy
was
granted
parliament
imposed
a
fine
of
pounds
with
imprisonment
had
the
sentence
been
fully
executed
it
would
have
caused
his
utter
ruin
the
king
however
interposed
and
his
favorite
escaped
with
a
few
days
confinement
in
the
tower
execution
of
sir
walter
raleigh
meanwhile
sir
walter
raleigh
had
been
executed
on
a
charge
of
treason
he
had
been
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
for
many
years
accused
of
having
plotted
against
the
king
influenced
by
greed
for
gain
james
released
him
to
go
on
an
expedition
in
search
of
gold
to
replenish
the
royal
coffers
raleigh
contrary
to
the
king
orders
came
into
collision
with
the
spaniards
on
the
coast
of
south
america
he
failed
in
his
enterprise
and
brought
back
nothing
raleigh
was
especially
hated
by
spain
not
only
on
account
of
the
part
he
had
taken
in
the
defeat
of
the
armada
but
also
for
his
subsequent
attacks
on
spanish
treasure
ships
and
property
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
two
plots
were
discovered
one
called
the
main
plot
aimed
to
change
the
government
and
perhaps
to
place
arabella
stuart
cousin
of
james
on
the
throne
the
object
of
the
second
conspiracy
called
the
bye
plot
was
to
obtain
religious
toleration
raleigh
was
accused
of
having
been
implicated
in
the
main
plot
it
is
said
that
james
had
treacherously
informed
the
spanish
ambassador
of
raleigh
voyage
so
that
the
collision
was
inevitable
the
king
of
that
country
now
demanded
vengeance
and
james
in
order
to
get
a
pretext
for
his
execution
revived
the
sentence
which
had
been
passed
on
raleigh
fifteen
years
before
he
doubtless
hoped
that
by
sacrificing
raleigh
he
might
secure
the
hand
of
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
spain
for
his
son
prince
charles
raleigh
died
as
sir
thomas
more
did
his
last
words
a
jest
at
death
his
deeper
feelings
found
expression
in
the
lines
which
he
wrote
on
the
fly
leaf
of
his
bible
the
night
before
his
judicial
murder
even
such
is
time
that
takes
in
trust
our
youth
our
joys
our
all
we
have
and
pays
us
but
with
age
and
dust
who
in
the
dark
and
silent
grave
when
we
have
wandered
all
our
ways
shuts
up
the
story
of
our
days
buy
from
this
earth
this
grave
this
dust

trust
death
of
james
james
died
suddenly
a
few
years
later
a
victim
of
sloth
drunkenness
and
gluttony
he
had
taught
his
son
prince
charles
to
believe
that
the
highest
power
on
earth
was
the
royal
will
it
was
a
terrible
inheritance
for
the
young
man
for
just
as
he
was
coming
to
the
throne
the
people
were
beginning
to
insist
that
their
will
should
be
respected
summary
three
chief
events
demand
our
attention
in
this
reign
first
the
increased
power
and
determined
attitude
of
the
house
of
commons
secondly
the
growth
of
the
puritan
and
independent
parties
in
religion
thirdly
the
establishment
of
permanent
colonies
in
virginia
and
new
england
destined
in
time
to
unite
with
others
and
become
a
new
and
independent
nation
the
american
republic
charles
i
accession
of
charles
result
of
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
which
had
been
so
zealously
put
forth
by
james
bore
its
full
and
fatal
fruit
in
the
career
of
his
son
unlike
his
father
charles
was
by
nature
a
gentleman
in
his
private
and
personal
relations
he
was
conscientious
and
irreproachable
in
public
matters
he
was
exactly
the
reverse
this
singular
contrast
this
double
character
as
it
were
arose
from
the
fact
that
as
a
man
charles
felt
himself
bound
by
truth
and
honor
but
as
a
sovereign
he
considered
himself
superior
to
such
obligations
in
all
his
dealings
with
the
nation
he
seems
to
have
acted
on
the
principle
that
the
people
had
no
rights
which
kings
were
bound
to
respect
the
king
two
mistakes
at
the
outset
charles
i
began
his
reign
with
two
mistakes
first
he
insisted
on
retaining
the
duke
of
buckingham
his
father
favorite
as
his
chief
adviser
though
the
duke
was
for
good
reasons
generally
distrusted
and
disliked
next
shortly
after
his
accession
charles
married
henrietta
maria
a
french
catholic
princess
the
majority
of
the
english
people
hated
her
religion
and
her
extravagant
habits
soon
got
the
king
into
trouble
to
meet
her
incessant
demands
for
money
and
to
carry
on
a
petty
war
with
spain
and
later
with
france
he
was
obliged
to
ask
parliament
for
funds
parliament
declined
to
grant
him
the
supply
he
demanded
unless
he
would
redress
certain
grievances
of
long
standing
charles
refused
and
dissolved
that
body
the
second
parliament
the
king
extorts
loans
necessity
however
compelled
the
king
to
call
a
new
parliament
when
it
met
the
commons
under
the
lead
of
sir
john
eliot
and
other
eminent
men
proceeded
to
draw
up
articles
of
impeachment
accusing
the
duke
of
buckingham
of
mismanagement
to
save
his
favorite
from
being
brought
to
trial
the
king
dissolved
parliament
and
as
no
supplies
of
money
had
been
voted
charles
now
proceeded
to
levy
illegal
taxes
and
to
extort
illegal
loans
sir
john
eliot
sir
edmund
hampden
cousin
of
the
famous
john
hampden
and
thomas
wentworth
refused
to
lend
his
majesty
the
sum
asked
for
for
this
refusal
they
were
thrown
into
prison
this
led
to
increased
agitation
and
discontent
at
length
the
king
found
himself
again
forced
to
summon
parliament
to
the
parliament
eliot
and
wentworth
with
others
who
sympathized
with
them
were
elected
thepetition
of
right
shortly
after
assembling
the
house
of
commons
led
by
sir
thomas
wentworth
and
john
pym
drew
up
the
petition
of
right
which
passed
the
lords
and
was
presented
to
the
king
for
his
signature
the
petition
was
a
law
reaffirming
some
of
the
chief
provisions
of
the
great
charter
which
the
nation
more
than
four
centuries
earlier
had
extorted
from
king
john
it
stipulated
in
particular
that
no
taxes
whatever
should
be
levied
without
the
consent
of
parliament
and
that
no
one
should
be
unlawfully
imprisoned
for
refusing
to
pay
such
taxes
in
the
petition
there
was
not
an
angry
word
but
as
a
member
of
the
commons
declared
we
say
no
more
than
what
a
worm
trodden
upon
would
say
if
he
could
speak
i
pray
thee
tread
on
me
no
more
charles
signs
the
petition
of
right
but
he
revives
monopolies
charles
refused
to
sign
the
petition
but
finding
that
money
could
be
got
on
no
other
terms
he
at
length
gave
his
signature
but
for
charles
to
pledge
his
royal
word
to
the
nation
meant
its
direct
and
open
violation
the
king
now
revived
the

had
been
abolished

of

acting
under

and
endeavored
to

sprang
forward
and
held
him
in

not

for

eleven
years
the

ruled
without

the
obnoxious
buckingham
had
led
an
expedition
against
france
which
resulted
in
miserable
failure
he
was
about
setting
out
on
a
second
expedition
to
aid
the
huguenots
who
had
rebelled
against
the
french
king
when
he
was
assassinated
his
successor
was
sir
thomas
wentworth
who
later
became
earl
of
strafford
wentworth
had
signed
the
petition
of
right
but
he
was
now
a
renegade
to
liberty
and
wholly
devoted
to
the
king
by
means
of
the
court
of
star
chamber
and
his
scheme
called
thorough
which
meant
that
he
would
stop
at
nothing
to
make
charles
absolute
strafford
labored
to
establish
a
complete
despotism
archbishop
laud
worked
with
strafford
through
the
high
commission
court
together
the
two
exercised
a
crushing
and
merciless
system
of
political
and
religious
tyranny
the
star
chamber
fining
and
imprisoning
those
who
refused
the
illegal
demands
for
money
made
upon
them
the
high
commission
court
showing
itself
equally
zealous
in
punishing
those
who
could
not
conscientiously
conform
to
the
established
church
of
england
to
strengthen
the
hands
of
archbishop
laud
and
to
secure
absolute
uniformity
of
faith
charles
issued
a
declaration
still
found
in
the
english
editions
of
the
book
of
common
prayer
which
forbade
any
one
to
understand
or
explain
the
articles
in
any
sense
except
that
established
by
the
bishops
and
the
king
charles
exasperated
the
puritans
still
further
by
reissuing
his
father
declaration
of
sunday
sports
which
had
never
really
been
enforced
this
declaration
encouraged
parishioners
to
dance
play
games
and
practice
archery
in
the
churchyards
after
divine
service
laud
used
it
as
a
test
and
turned
all
clergymen
out
of
their
livings
who
refused
to
read
it
from
their
pulpits
when
the
puritans
finally
got
the
upper
hand
they
publicly
burned

declaration
ship

john
hampden

pay
it
to

with
which
to
equip
a
standing
army
the
king
forced
the
whole
country
to
pay
a
tax
known
as
ship
money
on
the
pretext
that
it
was
needed
to
free
the
english
coast
from
the
depredations
of
algerine
pirates
during
previous
reigns
an
impost
of
this
kind
on
the
coast
towns
in
time
of
war
might
have
been
considered
legitimate
since
its
original
object
was
to
provide
ships
for
the
national
defense
in
time
of
peace
however
such
a
demand
could
not
be
rightfully
made
especially
on
the
inland
towns
as
the
petition
of
right
expressly
provided
that
no
money
should
be
demanded
from
the
country
without
the
consent
of
its
representatives
in
parliament
john
hampden
a
wealthy
farmer
in
buckinghamshire
refused
to
pay
the
twenty
shillings
required
from
him
he
did
not
grudge
the
money
but
he
would
not
tamely
submit
to
have
even
that
trifling
sum
taken
from
him
contrary
to
law
the
case
was
brought
to
trial
and
the
corrupt
judges
decided
for
the
king
hampden
and
cromwell
endeavor
to
leave
the
country
meanwhile
john
winthrop
with
many
other
puritans
emigrated
to
america
to
escape
oppression
according
to
tradition
john
hampden
and
his
cousin
oliver
cromwell
who
was
a
member
of
the
last
parliament
embarked
on
a
vessel
in
the
thames
for
new
england
but
it
is
said
that
they
were
prevented
from
sailing
by
the
king
order
the
two
friends
remained
to
teach
the
despotic
sovereign
a
lesson
which
neither
he
nor
england
ever
forgot
macaulay
essay
on
hampden
guizot
english
revolution
and
other
authorities
relate
the
proposed
sailing
of
hampden
and
cromwell
but
several
recent
writers
question
its
truth
the
difficulty
with
the
scottish
church
the
king
determined
to
force
the
use
of
a
prayer
book
similar
to
that
used
in
the
english
church
on
the
scotch
puritans
but
no
sooner
had
the
dean
of
edinburgh
opened
the
book
than
a
general
cry
arose
in
the
church
a
pope
a
pope
antichrist
stone
him
when
the
bishops
endeavored
to
appease
the
tumult
the
enraged
congregation
clapped
stamped
and
yelled
again
the
dean
tried
to
read
a
prayer
from
the
hated
book
when
an
old
woman
hurled
her
stool
at
his
head
shouting
d
mean
to
say
mass
at
my
lug
ear
riots
ensued
and
eventually
the
scotch
solemnly
bound
themselves
by
a
covenant
to
resist
all
attempts
to
change
their
religion
the
king
resolved
to
force
his
prayer
book
on
the
covenanters
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
mass
here
used
for
the
roman
catholic
church
service
the
first
covenanters
were
the
scottish
leaders
who
in
bound
themselves
by
a
solemn
covenant
to
overthrow
all
attempts
to
reestablish
the
catholic
religion
in
scotland
when
charles
i
undertook
to
force
the
scotch
to
accept
episcopacy
the
puritan
party
in
scotland
drew
up
a
new
covenant
to
resist
it
but
he
had
no
money
to
pay
his
army
and
the
short
parliament
which
he
summoned
in
the
spring
of
refused
to
grant
any
unless
the
king
would
redress
the
nation
grievances
the
long
parliament
impeachment
of
strafford
and
laud
the
grand
remonstrance
in
the
autumn
charles
summoned
that
memorable
parliament
which
met
in
november
of
it
sat
almost
continuously
for
thirteen
years
and
so
got
the
name
of
the
long
parliament
this
new
parliament
was
made
up
of
three
parties
the
church
of
england
party
the
presbyterian
party
and
the
independents
the
spirit
of
this
body
soon
showed
itself
john
pym
the
leader
of
the
house
of
commons
demanded
the
impeachment
of
strafford
for
high
treason
and
despotic
oppression
he
was
tried
and
sentenced
to
execution
the
king
refused
to
sign
the
death
warrant
but
strafford
himself
urged
him
to
do
so
in
order
to
appease
the
people
charles
frightened
at
the
tumult
that
had
arisen
and
entreated
by
his
wife
finally
put
his
hand
to
the
paper
and
thus
sent
his
most
faithful
servant
to
the
block
parliament
next
charged
archbishop
laud
with
attempting
to
overthrow
the
protestant
religion
it
condemned
him
to
prison
and
ultimately
to
death
next
it
abolished
the
star
chamber
and
the
high
commission
court
it
next
passed
the
triennial
act
a
bill
requiring
parliament
to
be
summoned
once
in
three
years
and
also
a
statute
forbidding
the
collection
of
ship
money
unless
authorized
by
parliament
the
triennial
act
was
repealed
in
form
only
in
it
was
reenacted
in
in
it
was
superseded
by
the
septennial
act
under
the
leadership
of
pym
it
followed
this
by
drawing
up
the
grand
remonstrance
which
was
printed
and
circulated
throughout
the
country
the
remonstrance
set
forth
the
faults
of
the
government
while
it
declared
utter
distrust
of
his
policy
cromwell
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
if
the
house
of
commons
had
failed
to
adopt
and
print
the
remonstrance
he
would
have
left
england
never
to
return
the
radicals
in
the
house
next
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
pass
the
root
and
branch
bill
for
the
complete
destruction
root
and
branch
of
the
established
church
of
england
finally
the
house
enacted
a
law
forbidding
the
dissolution
of

by
its
own
consent

so
laid
themselves
open

were
about

to

knew
better
than
charles
how
strong

case
could
be
made
out
against
his
frivolous
and
unprincipled
consort
driven
to
extremities
charles
determined
to
seize
the
five
members
john
pym
john
hampden
and
three
others
who
headed
the
opposition
the
king
commanded
the
house
of
commons
to
give
them
up
for
trial
the
request
was
not
complied
with
and
the
queen
urged
charles
to
take
them
by
force
saying
go
along
you
coward
and
pull
those
rascals
out
by
the
ears
thus
taunted
the
king
went
on
the
next
day
to
the
house
of
parliament
with
a
company
of
soldiers
to
seize
the
members
they
had
been
forewarned
and
had
left
the
house
taking
refuse
in
the
city
which
showed
itself
then
as
always
on
the
side
of
liberty
note
leaving
his
soldiers
at
the
door
the
king
entered
the
house

seeing
that
the
five
members
were
absent
the
king
turned
to
the
speaker
and
asked
where
they
were
the
speaker
kneeling
before
the
king
answered
may
it
please
your
majesty
i
have
neither
eyes
to
see
nor

to
speak
in
this
place
but
as
this
house
is
pleased
to
direct
me

that

left

came

was

each

they
were

deny

placed
under
the
joint
command
of
the
men
who
organized
it
very
many
of
its
officers
were

it
speedily
became

formidable

its
size
in
the
world
always
ready
to
preach
pray
exhort
or
fight
the
common
soldiers
as
well
as

did
not

pray

among

in

only

here

the

again
attempted

but
all
to
no
purpose
politically
speaking
charles
was
his
own
worst
enemy
he
was
false
to
the

as
carlyle
has
said
a
man
whose

will
not

charles
who
had
fled
to
carisbrooke
castle
in
the
isle
of
wight
made
a
secret
treaty
with
the
scots
promising
to
sanction
the

scotch
presbyterian
church
in
england
if
they
would
send
an
army
into
the

to
restore

to

throne
when
cromwell
found
out
that
charles
had
resolved
to
destroy
him
and
the
independent
army
he
apparently
made
up
his
mind
to
put

the

them
and
the

began
it
speedily
ended
in
the
utter
defeat
of

the

now
vowed

to
this
neither
the
presbyterians
in

house

nor
the
members
of

would
agree

pride
then
proceeded
as
he
said
to
purge
the
long
parliament
by
driving
out
all
who
were
opposed
to
this
measure
cromwell
had
no
part
in
pride
expulsion
of
members
though
he
afterwards
expressed
his
approval
of
it
those
who
remained
were
a
small
body
of
independents
only
they
did
not
number
sixty
they
became
the

against

the

was

less
than
half
of
these

were
present
throughout

who
signed

oliver
cromwell
was
one
prince
charles
the
king
son
then
a
refugee
in

made
every
effort
to
save
his

he
sent
a

paper
bearing
his
signature
and

to
the

offering
to
bind
himself
to
any
conditions
they
might
insert
provided
they
would
spare

but
no
answer
was
returned
the

was
brought
into

in

london
a
week
later
the

was
over
the
judges
pronounced
sentence
of
death
on
charles
stuart
king
of
england
as
a
tyrant
traitor
murderer
and
public
enemy
throughout
the
trial
charles
bore
himself
with
dignity
and
the
crisis
had
brought
out
the
best
elements
of
his
nature
he
was
beheaded
january
in
london
in
front
of
the
royal
palace
of
whitehall
a
great
shudder
ran
through
the
crowd
that
saw
the
deed
then
came
a
shriek
and
all
immediately
dispersed
tradition
declares
that
cromwell
went
secretly
that
night
to
see
the
beheaded
corpse
he
looked
steadfastly
at
it
shook

sighed

the
picture
of
cromwell
looking
at
the
corpse
summary
the
whole
of
charles
i
reign
must
be
regarded
as
a
prolonged
struggle
between
the
king
and
the
nation
under
the
tudors
and
james
i
the
royal
power
had
been
growing
more
and
more
despotic
while
at
the
same
time
the
progress
of
the
protestant
reformation
and
of
puritanism
had
encouraged
freedom
of
thought
between
these
opposite
forces
a
collision
was
inevitable
since
religious
liberty
always
favors
political
liberty
had
charles
known
how
to
yield
in
time
or
been
sincere
in
the
concessions
which
he
did
make
all
might
have
gone
well
his
duplicity
was
his
ruin
though
his
death
did
not
absolutely
destroy
the
theory
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
yet
it
gave
it
a
blow
from
which
it
never
recovered
the
commonwealth
and
protectorate

the
commonwealth
or

while
the

that
had

was
leaving

remnant
of

met
this

composed
of
only
about
fifty
members
claimed

for

a
few
days
later
it
abolished
the
house
of
lords
as
useless
and
dangerous
next
for
similar
reasons
it
abolished
the
office
of

and
declared
that

england
was
now
a

by

while

fairfax
with

the
real
power
was
in

and
the

of

was

without

the

all
members
of

with
those
who
held
any

were
required
to

allegiance
to
the
commonwealth
without

the
use
of

english
church
service
was
forbidden
and
the

of
charles

in
london
were
pulled
down
and
demolished
the
great
seal
of

had
already
been
cast
aside
and
a
new
one
adopted
having
on

side
a

shortly
after
the
establishment
of
the
commonwealth
general
fairfax
resigned
his
command
and
cromwell
became
the
sole
leader
of
the
military
forces
of
the
country
but
the
new
government
even
with
his
aid
had
no
easy
task
before
it
it
had
enemies
in
the
royalists
who
since
the
king
execution
had
grown
stronger
in
the
presbyterians
who
hated
both
the
rump
parliament
and
the
parliamentary
army
finally
it
had
enemies
in
its
own
ranks
for
there
were
fanatics
levelers
and
other
cattle
and
creeping
things
who
would
be
satisfied
with
nothing
but
destruction
and
confusion
levelers
a
name
given
to
certain
radical
republicans
who
wished
to
reduce
all
ranks
and
classes
to
the
same
level
with
respect
to
political
power
and
privileges
those
who
abandoned
all
established
ways
in
government
and
religion
among
these
there
were
socialists
or
communists
who
like
those
of
the
present
day
wished
to
abolish
private
property
and
establish
an
equal
division
of
unequal
earnings
while
others
declared
and
acted
out
their
belief
in
the
coming
end
of
the
world
eventually
cromwell
had
to
deal
with
these
enthusiasts
in
a
decided
way
especially
as
some
of
them
threatened
to
assassinate
him
in
order
to
hasten
the
advent
of
the
personal
reign
of
christ
and
his
saints
on

worcester
an
attempt
of
the
english
puritan
party
to
root

in

in

now
proclaimed

of
the
late
charles
i
king
parliament
deputed
cromwell
to
reduce
that
country
to
order
and
to
destroy
the
royalists
nothing
could
have
been
more
congenial
to
his
ironsides
than
such
a
crusade
they
descended
upon
the
unhappy
island
and
wiped
out
the
rebellion
in
such
a
whirlwind
of
fire
and
slaughter
that
the
horror
of
the
visitation
has
never
been
forgotten
to
this
day
the
direst
imprecation
a
southern
irishman
can
utter
is
the
curse
of
cromwell
on
ye
at
drogheda
and
wexford
cromwell
acting
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
war
of
that
day
massacred
the
garrisons
that
refused
to
surrender
several
years
later
cromwell
determined
to
put
in
practice
a
still
more
drastic
policy
he
resolved
to
repeople
a
very
large
section
of
southern
ireland
by
driving
out
the
roman
catholic
inhabitants
and
giving
their
lands
to
english
and
scotch
protestants
it
seemed
to
him
the
only
effectual
way
of
overcoming
the
resistance
which
that
island
made
to
english
rule
by
the
use
of
military
power
backed
up
by
an
act
of
parliament
his
generals
forced
the
people
to
leave
their
houses
and
emigrate
to
the
province
of
connaught
on
the
west
coast
part
of
that
district
was
so
barren
and
desolate
that
it
was
said
it
had
not
water
enough
to
drown
a
man
trees
enough
to
hang
him
or
earth
enough
to
bury
him
thousands
were
compelled
to
go
into
this
dreary
exile
and
hundreds
of
families
who
refused
were
shipped
to
the
west
indies
and
sold
to
the
planters
as
slaves
for
a
term
of
years
a
thing
often
done
in
that
day
with
prisoners
of
war
in
scotland
also
prince
charles
was
looked
upon
as
the
legitimate
sovereign
by
a
strong
and
influential
party
he
found
in
the
brave
montrose
who
was
hanged
for
treason
at
edinburgh
and
in
other
loyal
supporters
far
better
friends
than
he
deserved
the
prince
came
to
scotland
while
there
he
was
crowned
and
took
the
oath
of
the
covenant
it
must
have
been
a
bitter
pill
for
a
man
of
his
free
and
easy
temperament
but
worse
was
to
come
for
the
scottish
puritans
made
him
sign
a
paper
declaring
that
his
father
had
been
a
tyrant
and
that
his
mother
was
an
idolater
no
wonder
the
caricatures
of
the
day
represented
the
scots
as
holding
the
prince
nose
to
a
grindstone
later
prince
charles
rallied
a
small
force
to
fight
for
him
but
it
was
utterly
defeated
at
dunbar
see
the
execution
of
montrose
in
aytoun
lays
of
the
scottish
cavaliers
prince
charles
basely
abandoned
montrose
to
his
fate
twelve
months
afterward
on
the
anniversary
of
his
defeat
at
dunbar
the
prince
made
a
second
attempt
to
obtain
the
crown
at
the
battle
of
worcester
cromwell
again
routed
his
forces
and
brought
the
war
to
an
end
charles
escaped
in
shropshire
where
he
hid
for
a
day
in
an
oak
at
boscobel
after
many
narrow
escapes
he
at
length
succeeded
in
getting
out
of
the
country
cromwell
expels
parliament
cromwell
now
urged
the
necessity
of
dissolving
the
rump
parliament
and
of
electing
a
parliament
which
should
really
represent
the
nation
reform
the
laws
and
pass
a
general
act
of
pardon
in
his
despatch
to
the
house
of
commons
after
the
victory
of
worcester
he
called
the
battle
a
crowning
mercy
some
of
the
republicans
in
that
body
took
alarm
at
this
phrase
and
thought
that
cromwell
used
it
to
foreshadow
a
design
to
place
the
crown
on
his
own
head
for
this
reason
perhaps
they
hesitated
to
dissolve
but
at
last
they
could
not
withstand
the
pressure
and
a
bill
was
introduced
for
summoning
a
new
parliament
of
four
hundred
members
but
with
the
provision
that
all
members
of
the
present
house
were
to
keep
their
seats
and
have
the
right
to
reject
newly
elected
members
cromwell
with
the
army
believed
this
provision
a
trick
on
the
part
of
the
rump
to
keep
themselves
in
perpetual
power
sir
harry
vane
who
was
a
leading
member
of
the
house
of
commons
and
who
had
been
governor
of
the
colony
of
massachusetts
feared
that
the
country
was
in
danger
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
cromwell
as
military
dictator
he
therefore
urged
the
immediate
passage
of
the
bill
as
it
stood
cromwell
heard
that
a
vote
was
about
to
be
taken
putting
himself
at
the
head
of
a
squad
of
soldiers
he
suddenly
entered
the
house
after
listening
to
the
debate
for
some
time
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
charged
the
commons
with
injustice
and
misgovernment
a
member
remonstrated
cromwell
grew
excited
saying
you
are
no
parliament
i
say
you
are
no
parliament
then
he
called
in
the
musketeers
they
dragged
the
speaker
from
his
chair
and
drove
the
members
after
him
as
they
passed
out
cromwell
shouted
drunkard
glutton
extortioner
with
other
opprobrious
names
when
all
were
gone
he
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
during
the
night
some
royalist
wag
nailed
a
placard
on
the
door
bearing
the
inscription
in
large
letters
the
house
to
let
unfurnished
cromwell
becomes
protector
the
instrument
of
government
cromwell
summoned
a
new
parliament
which
was
practically
of
his
own
choosing
it
consisted
of
one
hundred
and
members
and
was
known
as
the
little
parliament
the
royalists
nicknamed
it
barebone
parliament
from
one
of
its
members
a
london
leather
dealer
named
barebone
notwithstanding
the
irregularity
of
its
organization
and
the
ridicule
cast
upon
it
the
parliament
proposed
several
reforms
of
great
value
which
the
country
afterwards
adopted
a
regularly
summoned
parliament
elected
by
the
people
would
have
been
much
larger
this
one
was
chosen
from
a
list
furnished
by
the
ministers
of
the
various
independent
churches
it
was
in
no
true
sense
a
representative
body
a
council
of
cromwell
leading
men
now
secured
the
adoption
of
a
constitution
entitled
the
instrument
of
government
it
made
cromwell
lord
protector
of
england
ireland
and
scotland
instrument
of
government
the
principal
provisions
of
this
constitution
were
the
government
was
vested
in
the
protector
and
a
council
appointed
for
life
parliament
consisting
of
the
house
of
commons
only
was
to
be
summoned
every
three
years
and
not
to
be
dissolved
under
five
months
a
standing
army
of
thirty
thousand
was
to
be
maintained
all
taxes
were
to
be
levied
by
parliament
the
system
of
representation
was
reformed
so
that
many
large
places
hitherto
without
representation
in
parliament
now
obtained
it
all
roman
catholics
and
those
concerned
in
the
irish
rebellion
were
disfranchised
forever
up
to
this
time
the
commonwealth
had
been
a
republic
nominally
under
the
control
of
the
house
of
commons
but
as
a
matter
of
facct
governed
by
cromwell
and
the
army
now
it
became
a
republic
under
a
protector
or
president
whowas
to
hold
his
office
for
life
a
few
years
later
parliament
offered
the
title
of
king
to
cromwell
and
with
it
a
new
constitution
called
the
humble
petition
and
advice
the
new
constitution
provided
that
parliament
should
consist
of
two
houses
since
the
majority
of
influential
men
felt
the
need
of
the
restoration
of
the
lords
for
said
a
member
of
barebone
parliament
the
nation
has
been
hopping
on
one
leg
altogether
too
long
cromwell
had
the
same
feeling
and
endeavored
to
put
an
end
to
the
hopping
by
trying
to
restore
the
house
of
lords
but
he
could
not
get
the
peers
to
meet
he
accepted
the
new
constitution
but
the
army
objected
to
his
wearing
the
crown
so
he
simply
remained

other
noted

had
emigrated
to

other
parts

during

the
case
was
reversed
and

ventured
to

he
dissolved

quite
as
peremptorily
as
the

king
had
done
soon
afterwards
fear
of

led
him
to
divide

into

however
though
compelled
to
resort
to
severe
measures
to
secure
peace
was
in
spirit
no
oppressor
on
the
contrary
he
proved
himself
the
protector
not
only
of
the
realm
but
of
the
protestants
of
europe
when
they
were
threatened
with
persecution
his
influence
saved
them
he
showed
too
that
in
an
age
of
bigotry
he
was
no
bigot
puritan
fanaticism
exasperated
by
the
persecution
it
had
endured
under
james
and
charles
often
went
to
the
utmost
extremes

hudibras
a
burlesque
poem
by
samuel
butler
it
satirized
the
leading
persons
and
parties
of
the
commonwealth
but
especially
the
puritans
it
treated
the
most
innocent
customs
if
they
were
in
any
way
associated
with
catholicism
or
episcopacy
as
serious
offenses
it
closed
all
places
of
amusement
it
condemned
mirth
as
ungodly
it
made
it
a
sin
to
dance
round
a
maypole
or
to
eat
mince
pie
at
christmas
and
were
forbidden
and
prohibited
not
because
it
gave
pain
to
the
bear
but
because
it
gave
pleasure
to
the
spectators
in
such
an
age
when
a
man
could
hardly
claim
to
be
religious
unless
he
wore
raiment
talked
through
his
nose
and
quoted
scripture
with
great
frequency
cromwell
showed
exceptional
moderation
and
good
sense
cromwell
religious
toleration
he
favored
the
toleration
of
all
forms
of
worship
not
directly
opposed
to
the
government
as
then
constituted
he
befriended
the
quakers
who
were
looked
upon
as
the
enemies
of
every
form
of
worship
and
who
were
treated
with
cruel
severity
both
in
england
and
america
he
was
instrumental
in
sending
the
first
protestant
missionaries
to
massachusetts
to
convert
the
indiands
then
supposed
by
many
to
be
a
remnant
of
the
lost
tribes
of
israel
and
after
an
exclusion
of
many
centuries
he
permitted
the
jews
to
return
to
england
and
even
to
build
a
synagogue
in
london
on
the
other
hand
there
are
few
of
the
cathedral
or
parish
churches
of
england
which
do
not
continue
to
testify
to
the
puritan
destructive
hatred
of
everything
savoring
of
the
rule
of
either
pope
or
bishop
the
empty
niches
where
some
gracious
image
of
the
virgin
or
the
figure
of
some
saint
once
looked
down
the
patched
remnants
of
brilliant
stained
glass
once
part
of
a
picture
telling
some
scripture
story
the
mutilated
statues
of
noted
men
the
tombs
hacked
and
hewed
by
pike
and
sword
because
they
bore
some
emblem
or
expression
of
the
old
faith
all
these
still
bear
witness
to
the
fury
of
the
puritan
soldiers
who
did
not
respect
even
the
graves
of
their
ancestors
if
those
ancestors
had
once
thought
differently
from
themselves
but
part
of
this
destruction
occurred
under
henry
viii
and
edward
vi
victories
by

and

yet
during
cromwell

the
country
notwithstanding
all
the
restrictions
imposed
by
a
stern
military
government
grew
and
prospered
the
english
forces
gained
victories
by
land
and
sea
and
made
the
name
of
the
protector
respected
as
that
of
charles
i
had
never
been
at
this
period
the
carrying
trade
of
the
world
by
sea
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
dutch
and
amsterdam
had
become
a
more
important
center
of
exchange
than
london
the
commonwealth
passed
a
measure
called
the
navigation
act
to
encourage
british
commerce
it
prohibited
the
importation
or
exportation
of
any
goods
into
england
or
its
colonies
in
dutch
or
other
foreign
vessels
the
navigation
act
was
renewed
later
though
aimed
at
the
dutch
this
measure
damaged
the
export
trade
of
the
american
colonies
for
a
time
later
war
with
the
dutch
broke
out
partly
on
account
of
questions
of
trade
and
partly
because
royalist
plotters
found
protection
in
holland
then
cromwell
created
such
a
navy
as
the
country
had
never
before
possessed
under
the
command
of
admiral
blake
the
sea
king
and
admiral
monk
the
dutch
were
finally
beaten
so
thoroughly
that
they
bound
themselves
to
ever
after
salute
the
english
flag
wherever
they
should
meet
it
on
the
seas
a
war
undertaken
in
alliance
with
france
against
spain
was
equally
successful
jamaica
was
taken
as
a
permanent
possession
by
the
british
fleet
and
france
in
return
for
cromwell
assistance
reluctantly
gave
the
town
of
dunkirk
to
england
and
the
flag
of
the
english
commonwealth
was
planted
on
the
french
coast
but
a
few
years
later
the
selfish
and
profligate
charles
ii
sold
dunkirk
back
to
louis
xiv
in
order
to
get
money
to
waste
on
his
pleasures
cromwell
death
his
character
after
being
king
in
everything
but
name
for
five
years
cromwell
died
september
on
the
anniversary
of
the
victories
of
dunbar
and
worcester
during
the
latter
part
of
his
career
he
had
lived
in
constant
dread
of
assassination
and
wore
concealed
armor
at
the
hour
of
his
death
one
of
the
most
fearful
storms
was
raging
hat
had
ever
swept
over
england
to
many
it
seemed
a
fit
accompaniment
to
the
close
of
such
a
life
in
one
sense
cromwell
was
a
usurper
and
a
tyrant
but
at
heart
his
object
was
his
country
welfare
in
such
cases
the
motive
is
all
in
all
he
was
a
lonely
man
of
rough
exterior
and
hard
manner
he
cared
little
for
the
smooth
proprieties
of
life
yet
he
had
that
dignity
of
bearing
which
high
moral
purpose
gives
in
all
that
he
did
he
was
eminently
practical
in
an
age
of
isms
theories
and
experiments
he
was
never
confused
and
never
faltered
in
his
course
a
colossal
bronze
statue
of
the
great
soldier
and
ruler
stands
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
of
parliament
where
the
english
people
more
than
two
hundred
and
forty
years
after
his
burial
voted
to
erect
it
cromwell
was
always
a
lonely
man
and
had
so
few
real
friends
that
walter
scott
may
have
expressed
his
true
feeling
when
he
makes
him
say
in
his
novel
of
woodstock
i
would
had
any
creature
were
it
but
a
dog
that
followed
me
because
it
loved
me
not
for
what
it
could
make
of
me
the
times
needed
such
a
man
there
are
emergencies
when
an
ounce
of
decision
is
worth
a
pound
of
deliberation
when
the
ship
is
foundering
or
on
fire
or
when
the
crew
have
mutinied
it
will
not
avail
to
sit
in
the
cabin
and
discuss
how
it
happened
something
must
be
done
and
that
promptly
cromwell
was
the
man
for
such
a
juncture
he
saw
clearly
that
if
the
country
was
to
be
kept
together
it
must
be
by
decided
measures
which
no
precedent
law
or
constitution
justified
but
which
stood
justified
none
the
less
by
exigencies
of
the
crisis
by
his
own
conscious
rectitude
of
purpose
and
by
the
result
if
there
is
any
truth
in
napoleon
maxim
that
the
tools
belong
to
him
that
can
use
them
then
cromwell
had
a
right
to
rule
for
first
he
had
the
ability
and
next
though
he
used
his
power
in
his
campaign
in
ireland
with
merciless
severity
yet
the
great
purpose
of
his
life
was
to
establish
order
and
justice
on
what
seemed
to
him
the
only
practical
basis
summary
cromwell
original
object
appears
to
have
been
to
organize
a
government
representing
the
will
of
the
nation
more
completely
than
it
had
ever
been
represented
before
he
strongly
favored
the
restoration
of
the
house
of
lords
he
endeavored
to
reform
the
laws
and
he
sought
to
secure
religious
toleration
for
the
great
body
of
protestants
one
who
knew
cromwell
intimately
said
a
larger
soul
i
think
hath
seldom
dwelt
in
a
house
of
clay
than
his
was
circumstances
however
were
often
against
him
he
had
many
enemies
and
in
order
to
secure
peace
he
was
obliged
to
resort
to
the
exercise
of
absolute
power
yet
the
difference
in
this
respect
between
cromwell
and
charles
i
was
immense
the
latter
was
despotic
on
his
own
account
the
former
for
the
advantage
of
those
he
governed
richard
cromwell
september
richard
cromwell
incompetency
richard
cromwell
oliver
eldest
son
now
succeeded
to
the
protectorate
he
was
an
amiable
individual
as
negative
in
character
as
his
father
had
been
positive
with
the
extreme
puritans
known
as
the
godly
party
he
had
no
sympathy
whatever
here
said
he
to
one
of
them
pointing
to
a
friend
of
his
who
stood
by
is
a
man
who
can
neither
preach
nor
pray
yet
i
would
trust
him
before
you
all
such
frankness
was
not
likely
to
make
the
new
ruler
popular
with
the
army
made
up
of
men
who
never
lacked
a
scripture
text
to
justify
either
a
murder
or
a
massacre
moreover
the
times
were
perilous
and
called
for
a
decided
hand
at
the
helm
after
a
brief
reign
of
less
than
eight
months
the
military
leaders
requested
richard
to
resign
and
soon
afterwards
recalled
the
rump
parliament
richard
retires
the
protector
retired
not
only
without
remonstrance
but
apparently
with
a
sense
of
relief
at
being
so
soon
eased
of
a
burden
too
heavy
for
his
weak
shoulders
to
carry
to
the
people
he
was
hereafter
familiarly
known
as
and
was
caricatured
as
such
on
tavern
signboards
the
nation
pensioned
him
off
with
a
moderate
allowance
and
he
lived
in
obscurity
to
an
advanced
age
carrying
about
with
him
to
the
last
a
trunk
filled
with
the
congratulatory
addresses
and
oaths
of
allegiance
which
he
had
received
when
he
became
protector
years
after
his
abdication
it
is
reported
that
he
visited
westminster
and
when
the
attendant
who
did
not
recognize
him
showed
him
the
throne
he
said
yes
i
have
not
seen
that
chair
since
i
sat
in
it
myself
in
the
convention
parliament
the
year
following
richard
cromwell
withdrawal
was
full
of
anxiety
and
confusion
the
army
of
the
commonwealth
had
turned
parliament
out
of
doors
there
was
no
longer
any
regularly
organized
government
and
the
country
drifted
helplessly
like
a
ship
without
a
pilot
general
monk
then
commander
in
chief
in
scotland
now
marched
into
england
with
the
determination
of
calling
a
new
parliament
which
should
be
full
free
and
representative
of
the
real
political
feeling
of
the
nation
when
he
reached
london
with
his
army
the
members
of
the
rump
parliament
had
resumed
their
sessions
at
monk
invitation
the
presbyterian
members
whom
colonel
pride
had
driven
from
their
seats
eleven
years
before
now
went
back
this
assembly
issued
writs
for
the
summoning
of
a
convention
parliament
so
styled
because
called
without
royal
authority
and
then
dissolved
by
their
own
consent
thus
ended
that
memorable
long
parliament
which
had
existed
nearly
twenty
years
about
a
month
later
the
convention
including
ten
members
of
the
house
of
lords
met
and
at
once
invited
charles
stuart
then
in
holland
to
return
to
his
kingdom
he
had
made
certain
promises
called
the
declaration
of
breda
which
were
intended
to
smooth
the
way
for
his
return
the
declaration
of
breda
made
by
charles
in
holland
promised
free
pardon
to
all
those
not
excepted
by
parliament
liberty
of
conscience
to
all
whose
views
did
not
disturb
the
peace
of
the
realm
the
settlement
by
parliament
of
all
claims
to
landed
property
the
payment
of
arrears
to
monk
army
summary
richard
cromwell
government
existed
in
name
only
never
in
fact
during
his
protectorate
the
country
was
under
the
control
of
the
army
of
the
commonwealth
or
of
that
rump
parliament
which
represented
nothing
but
itself
the
period
which
elapsed
after
oliver
cromwell
death
was
one
of
waiting
and
preparation
it
ended
in
the
meeting
of
the
free
national
parliament
which
put
an
end
to
the
republic
and
restored
royalty
in
the
person
of

accession
of
charles
a
new
standing
army
the
english
army
heard
that
charles
was
coming
with
sullen
silence
the
of
the
rump
parliament
with
sullen
dread
the
rest
of
the
nation
with
a
feeling
of
relief
however
much
they
had
hated
the
despotism
of
the
two
stuart
kings
james
i
and
charles
i
four
fifths
of
the
people
stood
ready
to
welcome
any
change
which
promised
to
do
away
with
a
government
maintained
by
bayonets
charles
ii
was
received
at
dover
with
the
wildest
demonstrations
of
joy
bells
pealed
flags
waved
bonfires
blazed
all
the
way
to
london
and
the
king
said
with
characteristic
irony
it
must
have
been
my
own
fault
that
i
did
not
come
before
for
i
find
no
one
but
declares
that
he
is
glad
to
see
me
the
existence
of
the
late
republic
and
the
protectorate
was
as
far
as
possible
ignored
the
house
of
lords
was
restored
the
new
reign
was
dated
not
when
it
actually
began
but
from
the
day
of
charles
i
execution
twelve
years
before
the
troops
of
the
commonwealth
were
speedily
disbanded
but
the
king
retained
a
picked
guard
of
five
thousand
men
which
became
the
nucleus
of
a
new
standing
army
the
king
character
the
sovereign
who
now
ascended
the
throne
was
in
every
respect
the
opposite
of
cromwell
charles
ii
had
no
love
of
country
no
sense
of
duty
no
belief
in
man
no
respect
for
woman
evil
circumstances
and
evil
companions
had
made
him
a
lad
but
voluptuary
for
twelve
years
he
had
been
a
wanderer
and
at
times
almost
a
beggar
now
the
sole
aim
of
his
life
was
enjoyment
he
desired
to
be
king
because
he
would
then
be
able
to
accomplish
that
aim
reaction
from
puritanism
in
this
purpose
charles
had
the
sympathy
of
a
considerable
part
of
the
people
the
puritan
faith
represented
by
such
men
as
hampden
and
milton
was
noble
indeed
but
unfortunately
there
were
many
in
its
ranks
who
had
no
like
grandeur
of
soul
but
who
pushed
puritanism
to
its
most
injurious
and
offensive
extreme
that
attempt
to
reduce
the
whole
of
life
to
a
narrow
system
of
sour
had
at
last
broken
down
now
under
the
restoration
the
reaction
set
in
and
the
lower
and
earthly
side
of
human
nature
none
the
less
human
because
it
is
at
the
bottom
and
not
at
the
top
seemed
determined
to
take
its
full
revenge

favorites
were
the
earl
of
rochester
a
gifted

ribald

became

have
left
on

estimate

first
wrote
on

here
lies
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
whose
word
no
man
relies
on
he
never
says
a
foolish
thing
nor
ever
does
a
wise
one
to
which
charles
on
reading
it
retorted
is
true
because
while
my
words
are
my
own
my
acts
are
my
ministers
a
bright
repartee
tells
us
what
the
second
favorite
thought
ah
shaftesbury
said
the
king
to
him
one
day
i
verily
believe
you
are
the
wickedest
dog
in
my
dominions
yes
your
majesty

for
a
subject
i
think
perhaps
i
may
be

punishment
of
the
regicides
from
a
political
point
of
view
the
new
reign
began
decently
and
ably
under
the
direction
of
the
earl
of
clarendon
as
leading
minister
or
adviser
to
the
king
the
first
act
of
charles
first
parliament
was
to
proclaim
a
pardon
to
all
who
had
fought
against
his
father
in
the
civil
war
the
only
persons
excepted
wre
the
members
of
that
high
court
of

which
had
sent
charles
i
to
the
block
of

ten
were
executed
and
nineteen
imprisoned
for

most
of
the
other
regicide
judges
were
either
already
out
of

country
or
managed
to
escape

where
they
remained
concealed
for
several

of

all
of
whom
had
served
as

in

of

were
dug
up
from

in

at

they
were
then
buried
at

along
with

moldering
remains
of

of

london
it

for

for

of

it
has
since
been
questioned
whether
cromwell
body
was
disposed
of
in
this
manner
or
whether
another
body
supposed
at

the
first
parliament
that
met
commanded
the
common
hangman
to
publicly
burn
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
it
restored
the
episcopal
form
of
worship
and
enacted
four
very
severe
laws
called
the
clarendon
code
against
those
nonconformists
or
dissenters
who
had
ejected
the
episcopal
clergy
the
chief
nonconformists
then
were
the
presbyterians
the
independents
or
congregationalists
the
baptists
the
society
of
friends
or
quakers
originally
the
name
nonconformist
was
given
to
those
who
refused
to
conform
to
the
worship
of
the
church
of
england
and
who
attempted
to
change
it
to
suit
their
views
or
else
set
up
their
own
form
of
faith
as
an
independent
church
the
name
nonconformist
or
dissenter
now
applies
to
any
protestant
outside
the
established
church
of
england
the
first
of
these
new
laws
was
entitled
the
corporation
act
it
ordered
all
holders
of
municipal
offices
to
renounce
the
covenant
which
had
been
put
in
force
in
and
to
take
the
sacrament
of
the
church
of
england
next
a
new
act
of
uniformity
enforced
the
use
of
the
episcopal
prayer
book
upon
all
clergymen
and
congregations
this
was
followed
by
the
conventicle
act
which
forbade
the
meeting
of
any
religious
assemblies
except
such
as
worshiped
according
to
the
established
church
of
england
lastly
the
act
forbade
all
dissenting
ministers
to
teach
in
schools
or
to
settle
within
five
miles
of
an
incorporated
town
covenant
the
oath
or
agreement
to
maintain
the
presbyterian
faith
and
worship

originated
in
scotland

the
second
of
these
stringent
retaliatory
statutes
the
act
of
uniformity
drove
two
thousand
presbyterian
ministers
from
their
parishes
in
a
single
day
and
reduced
them
to
the
direst
distress
the
among
them
might
indeed
pick
up
a
precarious
livelihood
by
hard
labor
but
the
old
and
the
weak
soon
found
their
refuge
in
the
grave
those
who
dared
to
resist
these
intolerant
and
inhuman
laws
were
punished
with
fines
imprisonment
or
slavery
the
scottish
parliament
abolished
presbyterianism
and
restored
episcopacy
it
vied
with
the
cavalier
or
king
party
in
england
in
persecution
of
the
dissenters
and
especially
of
the
covenanters
the
scottish
parliament
granted
what
was
called
the
indulgence
to
presbyterian
ministers
who
held
moderate
views
the
extreme
covenanters
regarded
these
indulged
presbyterians
as
deserters
and
traitors
who
were
both
weak
and
wicked
for
this
reason
they
hated
them
worse
than
they

he

and
turned

he
was

and
convicted

having
devilishly
and
perniciously
abstained

next
which
he

shut
up

of

filthy

he
forgot
the
misery
of
his

like
milton
in
his

loneliness
and
poverty
he
looked
within

found
that
the

is
its

place
and
in
itself
can
make
a

of
hell
as
i
walk
through

seizure
of
a
dutch
colony
in
america
while
these
things
were
going
on
in
england
a
strange
event
took
place
abroad
the
dutch
had
established
a
colony
on
the
hudson
river
it
was
on
territory
which
the
english
claimed
but
which
they
had
never
explored
or
settled
the
dutch
had
built
a
town
at
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
which
they
called
new
amsterdam
they
held
the
place
undisturbed
for
fifty
years
and
if
possession
is
nine
points
of
the
law
they
seem
to
have
acquired
it
furthermore
during
the
period
of
cromwell
protectorate
england
had
made
a
treaty
with
holland
and
had
recognized
the
claims
of
the
dutch
in
the
new
world
charles
had
found
shelter
and
generous
treatment
in
holland
when
he
needed
it
most
but
he
now
cooly
repudiated
the
treaty
and
though
the
two
nations
were
at
peace
he
treacherously
sent
out
a
secret
expedition
to
capture
the
dutch
colony
for
his
brother
james
duke
of
york
to
whom
he
had
granted
it
one
day
a
small
english
fleet
suddenly
appeared
in
the
harbor
of
the
dutch
town
and
demanded
its
immediate
and
unconditional
surrender
the
governor
was
unprepared
to
make
any
defense
and
the
place
was
given
up
thus
without
so
much
as
the
firing
of
a
gun
new
amsterdam
got
the
name
of
new
york
in
honor
of
the
man
who
had
now
become
its
owner
the
acquisition
of
this
territory
which
had
separated

from

the
new
city
had
not
risen
from
the
ruins
of
the
old
when
a
third
calamity
overtook
it
charles
was
at
war
with
france
and
holland
the
contest
with
the
latter
nation
grew
out
of
the
rivalry
of
the
english
and
the
dutch
to
get
the
exclusive
possession
of
foreign
trade
parliament
granted
the
king
large
sums
of
money
to
build
and
equip
a
navy
but
the
monarch
wasted
it
in
dissipation
the
few
ships
he
had
were
rotten
old
hulks
but
half
provisioned
with
crews
ready
to
mutiny
because
they
could
not

a

sailed
up

it
was
manned
in

by

who
had
deserted
in
disgust
because
when
they
asked
for
cash
to
support
their
families
they
got
only
worthless
government
tickets
there
was
no
force
to
oppose
them
they
burned
some
blockaded
london
for
several
weeks
and
then
made
their
own
terms

peace
the

of
dover
the
king
robs
the
exchequer
shortly
after
this
humiliating
event
the
enemies
of
clarendon
drove
him
from
office
the
fallen
minister
was
accused
of
high
treason
he
had
been
guilty
of
certain
arbitrary
acts
and
rather
than
stand
trial
he
fled
to
france
and
was
banished
for
life
he
sent
a
humble
petition
to
the
lords
but
they
promptly
ordered
the
hangman
to
burn
it
six
years
later
the
old
man
begged
piteously
that
he
might
come
back
and
die
in
his
own
coutnry
and
among
his
own
children
charles
refused
to
let
him
return
for
clarendon
had
committed
the
unpardonable
offense
of
daring
to
look
sourly
at
the
vices
of
the
king
and
his
shameless
companions
flushed
with
insolence
and
wine
charles
now
formed
a
new
ministry
or
cabal
consisting
of
five
of
his
most
intimate
friends
several
of
its
members
were
notorious
for
their
depravity
and
macaulay
calls
it
the
most
profligate
administration
ever
known
the
chief
object
of
its
leaders
was
to
serve
their
own
private
interests
by
making
the
king
power
supreme
the
cabal
true
spirit
was
not
unlike
that
of
the
council
of
the
infernal
peers
which
milton
portrays
in
paradise
lost
first
published
at
that
time
there
he
shows
us
the
five
princes
of
evil
moloch
belial
mammon
beelzebub
and
satan
meeting
in
the
palace
of
pandemonium
to
plot
the
ruin
of
the
world
he
chief
ambition
of
charles
was
to
rule
without
a
parliament
he
did
not
like
to
have
that
body
inquire
too
closely
how
he
spent
the
money
which
the
taxpayers
granted
him
but
his
lavish
outlays
on
his
favorites
made
it
more
and
more
difficult
for
him
to
avoid
summoning
a
parliament
in
order
to
get
supplies
of
cash
at
length
he
hit
on
a
plan
for
securing
the
funds
he
wanted
without
begging
help
from
parliament
this
word
was
originally
used
to
designate
the
confidential
members
of
the
king
private
council
and
meant
perhaps
no
more
than
the
word
cabinet
does
in
it
happened
however
by
a
singular
coincidence
that
the
initial
letters
of
the
five
persons
comprising
it
namely
c
lifford
a
lord
shaftesbury
b
uckingham
a
rlington
and
l
auderdale
formed
the
word
cabal
which
henceforth
came
to
have
the
odious
meaning
of
secret
and
unscrupulous
intrigue
that
it
has
ever
since
retained
it
was

time

the
political
ring

the

was

the
cabal
came
into
power
though
its
members
had
long
been
favorites
with
the
king
it
has
been
supposed
by
some
that
the
great
puritan
poet
had
them
in
his
mind
when
he
represented
the
pandemonic
debate

and

and

he
saw
in
charles
the
tool
he
wanted
to
gain
this
end
with
the
aid
of
two
members
of
the
cabal
charles
negotiated
the

of

thereby
louis
bribed
the
english
king
with
a
gift
of
pounds
to
help
him
carry
out
his
scheme
thus
without
the
knowledge
of

charles
deliberately
sold
himself
to
the
french
sovereign
who
was
plotting
to
destroy
the
political
liberty
and
protestant
faith
of
holland
in

however

suspending

a

whose
hideous
face
was
but
the
counterpart
of
a

more
hideous
character
pretended
that

had
formed
a
conspiracy
to
burn
london
massacre
the
inhabitants
kill
the

and
restore
the

the
news
of
this
alleged
discovery
caused
an
excitement
which
soon
grew
into
a
sort
of
popular
madness
the
memory
of
the
great
fire
was
still
fresh
in
people
minds
in
their
imagination
they
now
saw
those
scenes
of
horror
repeated
with
wholesale
murder
added
great
numbers
of
innocent
persons
were
thrown
into
prison
and
many
executed
as
time
went

the
terror
seemed
to
increase
with
its
increase

grew
bolder

chief

showed
himself
an
eager
abettor
of
the
miserable
wretch
who
swore
away
lives
for
the
sake
of
the
notoriety
it
gave
him
in
the
extravagance
of
his
presumption
oates
even
dared
to
accuse
the
queen
of
an
attempt
to
poison
charles
the
craze
however
had
at
last
begun
to
abate
somewhat
no
action
was
taken
and
in
the
next
reign
oates
got
the
punishment
he
deserved
or
at
least
a
part
of
it
an
attempt
was
now
made
to
pass
a
law
called
the
exclusion
bill
debarring
charles
brother
james
the
catholic
duke
of
york
from
succeeding
to
the
crown
but
though
voted
by
the
commons
it
was
defeated
by
the
lords
meanwhile
a
second
measure
called
the
disabling
act
had
received
the
sanction
of
both
houses
it
declared
catholics
incapable
of
sitting
in
either
house
of
parliament
and
from
this
date
they
remained
shut
out
from
all
legislative
power
and
from
all
civil
and
corporate
offices
until
a
period
of
over
a
century
and
a
half
rise
of
permanent
political
parties
the
king
revokes
city
charters
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
names
whig
and
tory
changed
after
to
liberal
and
conservative
began
to
be
given
to
two
political
parties
which
soon
became
very
powerful
and
practically
have
ever
since
divided
the
government
of
the
country
between
them
the
term
whig
was
originally
given
by
way
of
reproach
to
the
scotch
puritans
or
covenanters
who
refused
to
accept
the
episcopacy
which
charles
i
endeavored
to
impose
upon
them
tory
on
the
other
hand
was
a
nickname
which
appears
to
have
first
been
applied
to
the
roman
catholic
outlaws
of
ireland
who
were
regarded
by
elizabeth
and
by
cromwell
as
both
robbers
and
rebels
the
name
of
tory
was
now
given
to
those
who
supported
the
claims
of
the
king
brother
james
the
roman
catholic
duke
of
york
as
successor
to
the
throne
while
that
of
whig
or
country
party
was
borne
by
those
who
were
endeavoring
to
exclude
him
and
secure
a
protestant
successor
politically
the
whigs
and
tories
may
perhaps
be
considered
as
the
successors
of
the
roundheads
and
cavaliers
of
the
civil
war
the
former
seeking
to
limit
the
power
of
the
crown
the
latter
to
extend
it
at
the
restoration
the
cavaliers
were
but
at
the
time
of
the
dispute
on
the
exclusiiion
bill
the
roundhead
or
people
party
had
revived
on
account
of
their
petitioning
the
king
to
summon
a
new
parliament
by
means
of
which
they
hoped
to
carry
the
bill
shutting
out
the
catholic
duke
of
york
from
the
throne
they
were
called
petitioners
and
later
whigs
while
those
who
expressed
their
abhorrence
of
their
efforts
were
called
abhorrers
and
afterwards
tories
the
more
radical
whigs
came
to
be
known
as
the
country
party
and
at
least
one
of
their
most
prominent
leaders
algernon
sidney
was
in
favor
of
restoring
the
republican
form
of
government
in
england
the
excitement
over
this
exclusion
bill
threatened
at
one
period
to
bring
on
another
civil
war
in
his
fury
against
the
whigs
charles
revoked
the
charters
of
london
and
many
other
cities
which
were
regranted
only
on
terms
agreeable
to
the
tories
an
actual
outbreak
against
the
government
would
probably
have
occurred
had
it
not
been
for
the
discovery
of
a
new
conspiracy
which
resulted
in
a
reaction
favorable
to
the
crown
the
plot
this
conspiracy
known
as
the
plot
had
for
its
object
the
murder
of
charles
and
his
brother
james
at
a
place
called
the
rye
house
in
hertfordshire
not
far
from
london
it
was
concocted
by
a
number
of
violent
whigs
who
in
their
disappointment
at
their
failure
to
secure
the
passage
of
the
exclusion
bill
took
this
method
of
gaining
their
ends
it
is
said
that
they
intended
placing
on
the
throne
james
duke
of
monmouth
a
natural
son
of
charles
who
was
popularly
known
as
the
protestant
duke
algernon
sidney
lord
russell
and
the
earl
of
essex
who
were
prominent
advocates
of
the
exclusion
bill
were
arrested
for
participating
in
the
plot
essex
committed
suicide
in
the
tower
sidney
and
russell
were
tried
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
on
insufficient
evidence

who
was
supposed
to
be

banished

the
royal
society
early
in
this
reign
the
royal
society
was
established
for
purposes
of
scientific
research
in
an
age
when
thousands
of
people
still
cherished
a
lingering
belief
that
lead
might
be
changed
into
gold
that
some
medicine
might
be
discovered
which
would
cure
every
disease
including
old
age
that
worst
disease
of
all
when
every
old
woman
was
suspected
of
witchcraft
and
was
liable
to
be
tortured
and
hanged
on
that
suspicion
the
formation
of
an
association
to
study
the
physical
facts
was
most
significant
it
showed
that
the
time
had
come
when
instead
of

so
it
was
not

unsuccessful
in

a
great
reform
inaugurated
in
the
outset
of

was
the
abolition
of
the

right
to
feudal
dues
and
service
by
which
he
was
accustomed
to
extort
as

as

the
substitution
of
a
fixed
yearly
allowance
raised
by
tax
of
pounds
on
beer
and

this
change
may
be
considered
to
have
practically
abolished
the
feudal
system
in
england
so
far
as
the
crown
is
concerned
though
the

still
retains
some
remnants
of
that
system

who
had
been
subject
to

but
they

evelyn
one
of
the
courtiers
of
the

tells
us
in

diary
that
he
was
present
at
the
palace
of
whitehall
on
sunday
morning
the
last
of
january
of
that
year
there
he
saw
the
king
sitting
in
the
grand
banqueting
room
chatting
gayly
with
three
famous
court
beauties
his
special
favorites
while
a
crowd
of
richly
dressed
nobles
were
gathered
around
a
gambling
table
heaped
with
gold
six
days
after
as
he
expresses
it
all
was
in
the
dust
charles
died

james

quietly
brought
a
priest
into

chamber
in

to
hear
his

grant
him
absolution

few
english
rulers
ever
stood
in

need

the

were

two
leading
points
the
policy
of
the
king
that
of
the
nation
charles
ii
as
we
have
seen
lived
solely
to
gratify
his
inordinate
love
of
pleasure
for
that
he
wasted
the
revenue
robbed
the
exchequer
and
cheated
the
navy
for
that
he
secretly
sold
himself
to
france
made
war
on
holland
and
shamefully
deceived
both
parliament
and
people
in
so
far
then
as
charles
ii
had
an
object
it
began
and
ended
with
himself
therein
he
stood
lower
than
his
father
who
at
least
conscientiously
believed
in
the
divine
right
of
kings
and
their
accountability
to
the
almighty
the
policy
of
the
nation
on
the
other
hand
was
divided
the
whigs
were
determined
to
limit
the
power
of
the
crown
and
secure
at
all
hazards
a
protestant
successor
to
the
throne
the
tories
were
equally
resolved
to
check
the
growing
power
of
the
people
and
preserve
the
hereditary
order
of
succession
then
in

stuart
family
without
any
immediate
regard
to
the
religious
question
involved
in

issues
both
parties
had
a
common
object
which
was
to
maintain
the

episcopal
church
and
the
monarchical
system
of
government
whigs
and
tories
alike
detested
the
principles
of
the
late

period
they
preferred
to
cherish

james

brother
of
the
late
charles

now
came
to

throne
he
at
once
issued
a
proclamation
pledging
himself
to
preserve
the
government
in
both
church
and
state
as
it
is
now
by
law
established
this
solemn
declaration
was
welcomed
as
the
word
of
a
king
but
unfortunately
that
king
did
not
keep
his
word
his
first
great
ambition
was
to
rule
independently
of
parliament
so
that
he
might
have
his
own
way
in
everything
his
second
which
was
if
possible
still
nearer
his
heart
was
to
restore
the
roman
catholic
religion
in
england
he
began
that
restoration
at
once
and
on
the
easter
sunday
preceding
his
coronation
the
worship
of
the
church
of
rome
was

interval
of

hundred

years
performed

brought
the
miscreant
oates
to
trial
for
the
perjuries
he
had
committed
in
connection
with
the
popish
plot
he
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
life
in
addition
he
was
publicly
whipped
through
london
with
such
terrible
severity
that
a
few
more
strokes
of
the
lash
would
have
ended
his
worthless
life

was

time
of

a
number
of

who
were

fled
to
holland
where
the
duke
of

had
gone
when
banished
four
months
after
the
accession
of
james
the
duke
aided
by
these
refugees
and
by
a
small
force
which
he
had
gathered
in
the
netherlands
resolved
to
invade
england
and
demand
the
crown
he
believed
that
a
large
part
of
the
nation
would
look
upon
him
as
representing
the
cause
of
protestantism
and
would
therefore
rally
to
his
support
he
landed
at
lyme
on
the
coast
of
dorsetshire
and
there
issued
an
absurd
proclamation
declaring
james
to
be
a
usurper
tyrant
and
murderer
who
had
set
the
great
fire
of
london
cut
the
throat
of
essex
and
poisoned
charles
ii
at
taunton
in
somersetshire
a
procession
of
welcome
headed
by
a
lady
carrying
a
bible
met
the
duke
and
presented
him
with
the
book
in
behalf
of
the
protestant
faith
he
received
it
saying
i
come
to
defend
the
truths
contained
in
this
volume
and
to
seal
them
if
it
must
be
so
with
my
blood
shortly
afterwards
he
proclaimed
himself
sovereign
of
great
britain
he
was
popularly
known
as
king
monmouth
many
of
the
country
people
now
joined
him
but
the
whig
nobles
on
whose
help
he
had
counted
stood
aloof
alienated
doubtless
by
the
ridiculous
charges
he
had
made
against
james
at
the
battle
of
sedgemoor
in
somersetshire
king
monmouth
with
his
hastily
gathered
forces
was
utterly
routed
he
himself
was
soon
afterwards
captured
hiding
in
a
ditch
he
desired
to
be
taken
to
the
king
his
request
was
granted
when
he
entered
his
presence
he
threw
himself
down
and
crawled
to
his
feet
weeping
and
begging
piteously
for
life
only
life
on
any
terms
however
hard
he
denied
that
he
had
issued
the
lying
proclamation
published
at
lyme
he
denied
that
he
had
sought
the
crown
of
his
own
free
will
finally
in
an
agony
of
supplication
he
hinted
that
he
would
even
renounce
protestantism
if
thereby
he
might
escape
death
james
told
him
that
he
should
have
the
service
of
a
catholic
priest
but
would
promise
nothing
more
monmouth
groveled
and
pleaded
but
the
king
heart
was
like
marble
and
he
turned
away
in
silence
then
the
duke
seeing
that
all
his
efforts
were
vain
rose
to
his
feet
and
regained
his
manhood
he
was
forthwith
sent
to
the
tower
and
shortly
afterwards
to
execution
his
headless
body
was
buried
under
the
communion
table
of
that
little
chapel
of

macaulay
england
after
monmouth
death
there
were
no
further
attempts
at
insurrection
and
the
struggle
at
sedgemoor
remains
the
last
encounter
worthy
of
the
name
of
battle
fought
on
english
soil
the
bloody
assizes
the
defeat
of
the
insurgents
who
had
rallied
under
monmouth
flag
was
followed
by
a
series
of
trials
known
from
their
results
as
the
bloody
assizes
they
were
conducted
by
judge
jeffreys
assisted
by
a
band
of
soldiers
under
colonel
kirke
ironically
called
from
their
ferocity
kirke
lambs
jeffreys
was
by
nature
cruel
and
enjoyed
the
spectacle
of
mental
as
well
as
bodily
anguish
as
he
himself
said
he
delighted
to
give
those
who
had
the
misfortune
to
appear
before
him
a
lick
with
the
rough
side
of
his
tongue
preparatory
to
roaring
out
the
sentence
of
torture
or
death
in
which
he
delighted
still
more
all
who
were
in
the
remotest
way
implicated
in
the
late
rebellion
were
now
hunted
down
and
brought
to
a
trial
which
was
but
a
mockery
of
justice
no
one
was
permitted
to
defend
himself
in
fact
defense
would
have
been
useless
against
the
blind
fury
of
such
a
judge
the
threshold
of
the
court
was
to
most
that
crossed
it
the
threshold
of
the
grave
a
gentleman
present
at
one
of
these
scenes
of
slaughter
touched
with
pity
at
the
condition
of
a
trembling
old
man
called
up
for
sentence
ventured
to
put
in
a
word
in
his
behalf
my
lord
said
he
to
jeffreys
this
poor
creature
is
dependent
on
the
parish
do
trouble
yourself
cried
the
judge
i
will
soon
ease
the
parish
of
the
burden
and
ordered
the
officers
to
execute
him
at
once
those
who
escaped
death
were
often
still
more
to
be
pitied
a
young
man
was
sentenced
to
be
imprisoned
for
seven
years
and
to
be
whipped
once
a
year
through
every
market
town
in
the
county
in
his
despair
he
petitioned
the
king
to
grant
him
the
favor
of
being
hanged
the
petition
was
refused
but
a
partial
remission
of
the
punishment
was
at
length
gained
by
bribing
the
court
for
jeffreys
though
his
heart
was
shut
against
mercy
always
had
his
pockets
open
for
gain
alice
lisle
an
aged
woman
who
out
of
pity
had
concealed
two
men
flying
from
the
king
vengeance
was
condemned
to
be
burned
alive
and
it
was
with
the
gratest
difficulty
that
the
clergy
of
winchester
cathedral
succeeded
in
getting
the
sentence
commuted
to
beheading
as
the
work
went
on
the
spirits
of
jeffreys
rose
higher
and
higher
he
laughed
shouted
joked
and
swore
like
a
drunken
man
when
the
court
had
finished
its
sittings
more
than
a
thousand
persons
had
been
brutally
scourged
sold
as
slaves
hanged
or
beheaded
the
guideposts
of
the
highways
were
converted
into
gibbets
from
which
the
blackened
corpses
swung
in
chains
and
from
every
church
tower
in
somersetshire
ghastly
heads
looked
down
on
those
who
gathered
there
to
worship
god
in
fact
so
many
bodies
were
exposed
that
the
whole
air
was
tainted
with
corruption
and
death
not
satisfied
with
vengeance
alone
jeffreys
and
his
friends
made
these
trials
a
means
of
speculation
batches
of
rebels
were
given
as
presents
to
courtiers
who
sold
them
for
a
period
of
ten
years
to
be
worked
to
death
or
flogged
to
death
on
west
india

and
the
queen

extorted
large
sums
of

for

who
had
been
convicted
of
presenting
monmouth
with
a
royal
flag
at
taunton
on
the
return
of
jeffreys
to
london
after
this
carnival
of
blood
his
father
was
so
horrified
at
his
cruelty
that
he
forbade
him
to
enter
his
house
james
on
the
contrary
testified
his
approval
by
making
jeffreys
lord
chancellor
of
the
realm
at
the
same
time
mildly
censuring
him
for
not
having
shown
greater
severity
the
new
lord
chancellor
testified
his
gratitude
to
his
royal
master
by
procuring
the
murder
by
means
of
a
packed
jury
of
alderman
cornish
a
prominent
london
whig
who
was
especially
hated
by

of

support

which
was
intended
to
shut
james
out
from
the
throne
on
the
same
day
on
which
cornish
was
executed
jeffreys
also
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
elizabeth

burned
alive
at
tyburn

having
assisted

declaration
of
indulgence
oxford
an
event
occurred
about
this
time
which
encouraged
james
to
make
a
more
decided
attempt
to
restore
catholicism
henry
iv
of
france
had
granted
the
protestants
of
his
kingdom
liberty
of
worship
by
the
edict
of
nantes
louis
xiv
deliberately
revoked
it
by
that
shortsighted
act
the
huguenots
or
french
protestants
were
exposed
to
cruel
persecution
and
thousands
of
them
fled
to
england
and
america
james
who
like
his
late
brother
charles
ii
was
the
pensioned
slave
of
the
french
king
resolved
to
profit
by
the
example
set
him
by
louis
he
did
not
expect
to
drive
the
protestants
out
of
great
britain
as
louis
had
driven
them
from
france
but
he
hoped
to
restore
the
country
to
its
allegiance
to
rome
he
began
by
suspending
the
test
act
and
putting
catholics
into
important
offices
in
both
church
and
state
he
furthermore
established
an
army
of
men
on
hounslow
heath
just
outside
london
to
hold
the
city
in
subjection
in
case
it
should
rebel
the
dispensing
power
and
the
suspending
power
were
prerogatives
by
which
the
king
claimed
the
right
of
preventing
the
enforcement
of
such
laws
as
he
deemed
contrary
to
public
good
a
packed
bench
of
judges
sustained
the
king
in
this
position
but
the
power
so
to
act
was
finally
abolished
by
the
bill

raised

he
also
raised

boasted
james
was
eventually
sung

of
this
satirical
political
ballad
which
it
is
said
was
sung
and
whistled
from
one
end
of
england
to
the
other
in
derision
of
the

it

the
courts
completely
under

through

in
sympathy
with

and
with
himself
the
king
issued
a
declaration
of
indulgence
similar
to
that
which
his
brother
charles
ii
had
issued
it
suspended
all
penal
laws
against
both
the

on

other
the
latter
however
suspecting
that
this
apparently
liberal
measure
was
simply
a
trick
to
establish
catholicism
refused
to

themselves

it

denounced
it

open
violation

james
next
proceeded
by
means
of
the
tyrannical
high
commission
court
which
he
had
revived
to
bring
magdalen
college
oxford
under
catholic
control
the
president
of
that
college
having
died
the
fellows
were
considering
the
choice
of
a
successor
the
king
ordered
them
to
elect
a
catholic
the
fellows
refused
to
obey
and
elected
a
protestant
james
ejected
the
new
president
and
drove
out
the
fellows
leaving
them
to
depend
on
the
charity
of
neighboring
country
gentlemen
for
their
support
but
the
king
in
attacking
the
rights
of
the
college
had
run
his
head
against
a
wall
as
he
soon
discovered
to
his
sorrow
his
temporary
success
however
emboldened
him
to
reissue
the
first
declaration
of
indulgence
its
real
object
like
that
of
the
first
declaration
was
to
put
roman
catholics
into
still
higher
positions
of
trust
and
power

building
is
that
asked
the
duke
of
wellington
of
his
companion
croker
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
magdalen
college
wall
just
as
they
entered
oxford
in
that
is
the
wall
which
james
ii
ran
his
head
against
was
the
reply
the
petition
of
the
seven
bishops
james
commanded
the
clergy
throughout
the
realm
to
read
this
declaration
on
a
given
sunday
from
their
pulpits
the
clergy
were
by
nature
conservative
they
still
generally
upheld
the
theory
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
and
of
passive
obedience
a
majority
of
them
taught
the
doctrine
which
james
i
had
proclaimed
god
makes
the
king
the
king
makes
the
law
his
subjects
are
bound
to
obey
the
law
now
however
nearly
all
of
them
revolted
they
felt
that
to
comply
with
the
mandate
of
the
king
would
be
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
supremacy
of
the
church
of
england
in
this
crisis
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
accompanied
by
six
bishops
petitioned
the
king
to
be
excused
from
reading
it
from
their
pulpits
the
king
refused
to
consider
the
petition
when
the
day
came
hardly
a
clergyman
read
the
paper
and
in
westminster
abbey
the
entire
congregation
rose
in
a
body
and
left
rather
than
listen
to
it
furious
at
such
an
unexpected
result
james
ordered
the
refractory
bishops
to
be
sent
to
the
tower
and
kept
prisoners
there
the
whole
country
now
seemed
to
turn
against
the
king
by
his
obstinate
folly
james
had
succeeded
in
making
enemies
of
all
classes
not
only
of
the
whig
roundheads
who
had
fought
against
his
father
in
the
civil
war
but
also
of
the
tory
cavaliers
who
had
fought
for
him
and
of
the
clergy
who
had
taught
the
duty
of
obedience
to
him
one
of
the
bishops
sent
to
the
tower
was
trelawney
of
bristol
he
was
a
native
of
cornwall
the
news
of
his
imprisonment
roused
the
rough
independent
population
of
that
country
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
the
people
were
now
heard
singing
and
shall
trelawney
die
and
shall
trelawney
die
there
thirty
thousand
cornishmen
will
know
the
reason
why
then
the
miners
took
up
the
words
and
beneath
the
hills
and
fields
the
ominous
echo
was
heard
and
shall
trelawney
die
and
shall
trelawney
die
there
twenty
thousand
underground
will
know
the
reason
why
when
the
seven
bishops
were
brought
to
trial
the
popular
feeling
in
their
favor
was
so
strong
that
not
even
james
servile
judges
dared
use
their
influence
to
convict
them
after
the
case
was
given
to
the
jury
the
largest
and
most
robust
man
of
the
twelve
rose
and
said
to
the
rest
look
at
me
i
am
bigger
than
any
of
you
but
before
i
will
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
i
will
stay
here
until
i
am
no
thicker
than
a
tobacco
pipe
that
decided
the
matter
and
the
bishops
were
acquitted
the
news
was
received
in

like
the
tidings
of
some
great
victory
with
shouts
of
joy
illuminations
and
bonfires

of
a
prince
invitation
to
william
of

but
just
before
the
acquittal
an
event
took
place
which
changed
everything
and
brought
on
the
glorious
revolution
of
for
such
was
the
title
which
was
solemnly
given
to
it
after
william
and
mary
had
come
to
the
throne
up
to
this
time
the
succession
to
the
throne
after
james
rested
with
his
two
daughters
mary
who
had
married
william
prince
of
orange
president
of
the
dutch
republic
and
resided
in
holland
and
her
younger
sister
anne
who
had
married
george
prince
of
denmark
and
was
then
living
in
london
both
of
the
daughters
were
zealous
protestants
and
the
expectation
that
one
of
them
would
receive
the
english
crown
on
the
king
death
had
kept
the
people
quiet
while
james
was
endeavoring
to
restore
catholicism
but
while
the
seven
bishops
were
in
prison
awaiting
trial
the
alrming
intelligence
was
spread
that
a
son
had
been
born
to
the
king
if
true
he
would
now
be
the
next
heir
to
the
crown
and
would
in
all
probability
be
educated
and
come
to
power
a
catholic
this
prospect
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
many
people
especially
the
whigs
believed
the
whole
matter
an
imposition
and
it
was
reported
that
the
young
prince
was
not
the
true
son
of
the
king
and
queen
but
a
child
that
had
been
smuggled
into
the
palace
to
deceive
the
nation
for
this
report
there
was
absolutely
no
foundation
in
fact
on
the
very
day
that
the
bishops
were
set
at
liberty
seven
of
the
leading
nobility
and
gentry
representing
both
the
whigs
and
the
tories
seconded
by
the
city
of
london
secretly
sent
a
formal
invitation
to
william
prince
of
orange
the
champion
of
protestantism
on
the
continent
and
the
deadly
foe
of
james
ally
the
king
of
france
admiral
herbert
disguised
as
a
common
sailor
set
out
on
the
perilous
errand
to
the
prince
the
invitation
he
carried
implored
william
to
come
over
with
an
army
to
defend
his
wife
claim
to
the
english
throne
and
to
ensure
the
restoration
of
english
liberties
and
the
protection
of
the
protestant
religion
william
decided
to
accept
the
invitation
which
was
probably
not
unexpected
on
his
part
he
was
confirmed
in
his
decision
not
only
by
the
cordial
approval
of
the
leading
catholic
princes
of
europe
except
of
course
louis
xiv
of
france
but
also
by
the
pope
himself
who
had
more
than

expressed

emphatic
disgust

rashness
of

the

taken

thus
quietly
because

were
ripe
for

england
had
entered
upon
another
period
of

in
which
old
institutions

and
customs
were
passing

and
all
was
becoming

had
vanished
under

had
continued

hear
no

revocation

or

punishments
inflicted
because
of

and
rarely
of
any
punishment

dissent
courts
of
justice
will
undergo
reform
they
will
cease
to
be
little
better
than
caverns
of
murderers
where
judges
like
scroggs
and
jeffreys
browbeat
the
prisoners
took
their
guilt
for
granted
insulted
and
silenced

there
of

the

king
heaviest
retribution
in

to
prevent
the
coming
of
this

had
absolutely
failed
summary
the
reign
of
james
must
be
regarded
as
mainly
taken
up
with
the
attempt
of
the
king
to
rule
independently
of
parliament
and
of
law
and
apparently
he
sought
to
restore
the
roman
catholic
faith

the
established
church
of

though
without
real
justification
since
he
could
not
legitimately
claim

of
that
memorable
revolution
which
invited
william

the

name

james
they
were

numerous
and
determined
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
and
the
south
of
ireland
they
kept
up
a
secret
correspondence
with
the
refugee
monarch
and
were
constantly
plotting
for
his
restoration
about
four
hundred
of
the
clergy
of

church

the
archbishop
of

and

more
of

bishops

some
members
of

universities
and
also
some
scotch
presbyterians
refused
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to

and

they
became
known
on
this
account
as
the
nonjurors
and
although
they
were
never
harshly
treated
they
were
compelled
to
resign
their
positions
the
mutiny
act
and
the
toleration
act
we
have
seen
that
one
of
the
chief
means
of
despotism
on
which
james
ii
relied
was
the
organization
of
a
powerful
standing
army
such
as
was
unknown
in
england
until
cromwell
was
compelled
to
rule
by
military
force
charles
ii
had
perpetuated
such
an
army
but
it
was
so
small
that
it
was
no
longer
formidable
it
was
now
evident
that
owing
to
the
abolition
of
the
feudal
levies
a
standing
army
under
the
king
command
must
be
maintained
especially
as
war
was
impending
with
louis
xiv
who
threatened
by
force
of
arms
and
with
the
help
of
the
jacobites
to
restore
james
ii
to
the
english
throne
to
prevent
the
sovereign
from
making
bad
use
of
such
a
power
parliament
passed
a
law
called
the
mutiny
act
which
practically
put
the
army
under
the
control
of
the
nation
as
it
has
since
remained
thus
all
danger
from
that
source
was
taken
away
the
mutiny
act
provides
that
the
standing
army
shall
be
at
the
king
command
subject
to
certain
rules
for
one
year
only
that
no
pay
shall
be
issued
to
troops
except
by
special
acts
of
parliament
that
no
act
of
mutiny
can
be
punished
except
by
the
annual
reenactment
of
the
mutiny
bill
james
next
method
for
bringing
the
country
under
the
control
of
rome
had
been
to
issue
declarations
of
indulgence
it
was
generally
believed
that
his
object
in
granting
these
measures
of
toleration
which
promised
freedom
to
all
religious
beliefs
was
that
he
might
place
roman
catholics
in
power
as
an
offset
to
these
declarations
parliament
now
passed
the
toleration
act
which
secured
freedom
of
worship
to
all
religious
believers
except
papists
and
such
as
deny
the
trinity
this
measure
though
and
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
broader
and
juster
ideas
of
toleration
which
have
since
prevailed
was
nevertheless
a
most
important
reform
it
put
an
end
at
once
and
forever
to
the
persecution
which
had
disgraced
the
reigns
of
the
stuarts
though
unfortunately
it
still
left
the
catholics
the
unitarians
and
the
jews
subject
to
the
heavy
hand
of
tyrannical
oppression
and
they
remained
so
for
many
years
in
charles
granted
a
charter
to
rhode
island
which
secured
religious
liberty
to
that
colony
it
was
the
first
royal
charter
recognizing
the
principle
of
toleration
the
bill
of
rights
and
act
of
settlement
not
many
months
later
parliament
embodied
the
declaration
of
right
with
some
slight
changes
in
the
bill
of
rights
which
received
the
signature
of
the
king
and
became
law
it
constitutes
the
third
and
last
great
step
which
england
has
taken
in
making
anything
like
a
formal
written
constitution
the
first
being
magna
carta
or
the
great
charter
and
the
second
the
petition
of
right
the
habeas
corpus
act
was
contained
in
germ
at
least
in
magna
carta
hence
these
three
measures
namely
magna
carta
the
petition
of
right
and
the
bill
of
rights
including
the
act
of
settlement
to
be
mentioned

up

safeguards
of

and

it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
a
large
part
of
the
english
constitution
is
based
on
ancient
customs
or
unwritten
laws
and
another
part
on
acts
of
parliament
passed
for
specific
purposes
with
the
passage
of
the
bill
of
rights
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
to
govern
without
being
accountable
to
their
subjects
which
james
i
and
his
descendants
had
tried

the
chief
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
were
that
the
king
should
not
maintain
a
standing
army
in
time
of
peace
except
by
consent
of
parliament
that
no
money
should
be
taken
from
the
people
save
by
the
consent
of
parliament
that
every
subject
has
the
right
to
petition
the
crown
for
the
redress
of
any
grievance
that
the
election
of
members
of
parliament
ought
to
be
free
from
interference
that
parliament
should
frequently
assemble
and
enjoy
entire
freedom
of
debate
that
the
king
be
debarred
from
interfering
in
any
way
with
the
proper
execution
of
the
laws
that
a
roman
catholic
or
a
person
marrying
a
roman
catholic
be
henceforth
incapable
of
receiving
the
crown
of
england
late
in
the
reign
parliament
reaffirmed
and
still
further
extended
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rightss
by
the
act
of
settlement
which
established
a
new
royal
line
of
sovereigns
confined
exclusively
to
protestants
this
act
with
the
preceding
one
may
be
said
to
have
introduced
that
principle
of
the
british
constitution
which
has
been
called
the
reign
of
law
it
practically
abolished
the
principle
of
a
fixed
hereditary
succession
and
reestablished
in
the
clearest
and
most
decided
manner
the
right
of
the
nation
to
choose
its
own
rulers

as
hallam
says
she
was
very
far
removed
from

aside
from
james
ii
son
whose
legitimacy
no
one
now
doubted
there
were
several
who
stood
nearer
in
right
of
succession
according
to
that
measure
an
english
sovereign
is
now
as
much
the
creature
of
an
act
of
parliament
as
the
pettiest
taxgatherer
in
his
realm
and
he
is
dependent
for
his
office
and
power
on
the
will
of
the
people

not
as

finally
the

royal
succession
to

unconstitutional
for

to

invite
the
papal
power

the

to

now
established
the
salutory
rule
that
no
money
should
be
voted
to
the
king
except
for
specific
purposes
and
it
also
limited
the
royal
revenue
to
a
few
years
supply
instead
of
granting
it
for
life
as
had
been
done
in
the
case
of
charles
ii
and
james
later
the
supply
was
limited
to
an
annual

act
made
the
army
dependent
for
its
existence
on

annual
meeting

two
measures
practically

people
full
control
of
the
two
great
powers
the
purse
and
the
sword
which
they
have
ever
since
retained

next
enacted
that
judges
should
hold
office
not
as
heretofore
at
his
majesty
pleasure
but
during
good
behavior
or
until
the
death
of
the
reigning
sovereign
vacated
their
commissions
this
took
away
that
dangerous
authority
of
the
king
over
the
courts
of
justice
which
had
caused
so
much
oppression
and
cruelty
but
as
macaulay
remarks
of
all
the
reforms
produced
by
the
change
of
government
perhaps
none
proved
more
extensively
useful
than
the
establishment
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
up
to
this
time
no
book
or
newspaper
could
be
published
in
england
without
a
license
in
the
period
of
the
commonwealth
john
milton
the
great
puritan
poet
had
earnestly
labored
to
get
this
severe
law
repealed
declaring
that
while
he
who
kills
a
man
kills
a
reasonable
creature
he
who
destroys
a
good
book
by
refusing
to
let
it
appear
in
print
kills
reason
itself
but
under
james
ii
chief
justice
scroggs
had
declared
it
a
crime
to
publish
anything
whatever
concerning
the
government
whether
true
or
false
without
a
license
during
that
reign
there
were
only
four
places
in
england
namely
london
oxford
cambridge
and
york
where
any
book
pamphlet
or
newspaper
could
be
legally
issued

landed
in

in
the
spring
with
a
small
french
force
lent
him
by
louis
xiv
he
established
his
headquarters
at
dublin
not
long
afterwards
he
issued
that
great
act
of
attainder
which
summoned
all
who
were
in
rebellion
against
his
authority
to
appear
for
trial
on
a
given
day
or
be
declared
traitors
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
and
their
property
confiscated

the

was

for
more
than
three
months

held
out
against

this
act
contained
between
two
and

thousand
names
it
embraced
all
classes
from
half
the
peerage
of

to
tradesmen
women
and
children
if
they
failed
to
appear
they
could
be
put
to
death
without
trial
the
starving
inhabitants
exceeding
thirty
thousand
in
number
were
finally
reduced
to
the
last
extremities
nothing
was
left
to
eat
but
a
few
miserable
horses
and
some
salted
hides
as
they
looked
into
each
other
hollow
eyes
the
question
came
must
we
surrender
then
it
was
that
an
aged
clergyman
the
venerable
george
walker
one
of
the
governors
of
the
city
pleaded
with
them
bible
in
hand
to
remain
firm
that
appeal
carried
the
day
they
declared
that
rather
than
open
the
gates
to
the
enemy
they
would
perish
of
hunger
or
as
some
voice
whispered
that
they
would
fall
first
on
the
horses
and
the
hides
then
on
the
prisoners
then
on
each
other
but
at
this
moment
when
all
hope
seemed
lost
a
shout
of
triumph
was
heard
an
english
force
had
sailed
up
the

broken
through
all
obstructions

the
valiant

saved

king
william
commanded
in

on

side
while
james

was

on

william
had
a
somewhat
larger

and
by

the
greater

the
contest
ended
with
the
utter
defeat
of
james
he
stood
on
a
hill
at
a
safe
distance
and
when
he
saw
that
the
battle
was
going
against
him
turned
and
fled
to
france
william
on
the
other
hand
though
suffering
from
a
wound
led
his

the
cowardly
behavior
of

excited
the
disgust
and
scorn
of

no

cared
to
remain

after

were
permitted

when
the
wild

was
hushed
the
silence
of
death
settled
down
upon
ireland
for
a
hundred
years
the
country
remained
at
peace
but
the
peace
was
that
of
despair
in
violation
of
that
treaty
a
severe
act
was
passed
against
roman
catholics
they
were
hunted
like
wild

and
terrible
vengeance
was
now
taken
for
that
act
of
attainder
which
james
had
issued
furthermore
england
selfishly
closed

the

that

many

that
all

at

of

though
a

zealous
protestant
and
an
ardent
upholder
of
the

of
england
she
declared
her
faith
in
the
divine
right
of

which
had
cost
her
grandfather

his

she
was
the

the
touch

could
dispel

the
first
theory
she
never

proclaimed
in
any
offensive
way
but
the
harmless
delusion
that
she
could
relieve
the
sick
was
a
favorite
notion
with
her
and
we
find
in

official
announcement
stating
that
on

johnson

and
low
politically
the
government
of
the
country
was
divided
between
the
two
great
parties
of
the
whigs
and
the
tories
since
uscceeded
by
the
liberals
and
conservatives
though
mutually
hostile
each
believing
that
its
rival
success
meant
national
ruin
yet
both
were
sincerely
opposed
to
despotism
on
the
one
hand
and
to
anarchy
on
the
other
the
whigs
setting
parliament
above
the
throne
were
pledged
to
maintain
the
act
of
settlement
and
the
protestant
succession
while
the
tories
insisting
on
a
strict
unbroken
line
of
hereditary
sovereigns
were
anxious
to
set
aside
that
act
and
restore
the
excluded
stuarts
the
church
of
england
was
likewise
divided
into
two
parties
known
as
high
church
and
low
church
the
first
who
were
generally
tories
wished
to
exalt
the
power
of
the
bishops
and
were
opposed
to
the
toleration
of
dissenters
the
second
who
were
whigs
as
a
rule
believed
it
best
to
curtail
the
authority
of
the
bishops
and
to
secure
to
all
trinitarian
protestants
entire
liberty
of
worship
and
all
civil
and
political
rights
and
privileges
thus
to
the
bitterness
of
heated
political
controversy
there
was
added
the
still
more
acrid
bitterness
of
theological
dispute
addison
illustrates
the
feeling
that
then
prevailed
by
an
amusing
story
of
an
earlier
occurrence
a
boy
who
had
lost
his
way
in
london
was
called
a
popish
cur
by
a
whig
because
he
ventured
to
inquire
for
saint
anne
lane
while
he
was
cuffed
for
irreverence
by
a
tory
when
correcting
himself
he
asked
bluntly
for
anne
lane
the
queen
although
she
owed
her
crown
mainly
to
the
whigs
sympathized
with
the
tories
and
the
high
church
and
did
all
in
her
power
to
strengthen
both
as
for
the
leaders
of
the
two
parties
they
seem
to
have
looked
out
first
for
themselves
and
afterwards
often
a
long
way
afterwards
for
their
country
during
the
whole
reign
they
were
plotting
and
counterplotting
mining
and
undermining
their
subtle
schemes
to
secure
office
and
destroy
each
other
become
as
incomprehensible
and
fathomless
as
those
of
the
fallen
angels
in

of

pit
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
anne
had
no
sooner
come
to
the
throne
than
war
broke
out
with
france
it
had
its
origin
in
the
previous
reign
william
iii
had
cared
little
for
england
compared
with
his
native
holland
whose
interests
always
had
the
first
place
in
his
heart
he
had
spent
his
life
battling
to
preserve
the
independence
of
the
dutch
republic
and
fighting
louis
xiv
of
france
who
was
determined
if
possible
to
annex
the
netherlands
including
holland
to
his
own
dominions
during
the
latter
part
of
william
reign
the
french
king
seemed
likely
to
be
able
to
accomplish
his
purpose
the
king
of
spain
who
had
no
children
was
in
feeble
health
and
at
his
death
it
was
probable
that
louis
xiv
grandson
philip
of
anjou
would
receive
the
crown
if
that
happened
louis
xiv
who
was
then
the
most
powerful
prince
in
europe
would
obtain
the
control
of
the
spanish
dominions
which
besides
spain
comprise
a
large
part
of
the
netherlands
parts
of
italy
and
immense
provinces
in
south
america
the
possession
of
such
an
empire
would
make
louis
irresistible
in
europe
and
the
little
free
protestant
states
of
holland
could
not
hope
to
stand
before
him
the
whole
of
the
netherlands
at
one
time
belonged
to
spain
but
the
northern
part
or
holland
had
succeeded
in
establishing
its
independence
and
was
protected
on
the
southern
frontier
by
a
line
of
fortified
towns
not
long
afterwards
the
king
of
spain
died
and
bequeathed
the
crown
to
philip
of
anjou
when
philip
left
paris
for
madrid
louis
xiv
exultingly
exclaimed
the
pyrenees
no
longer
exist
that
was
simply
his
short
way
of
saying
now
france
and
spain
are
made
one
and
france
is
that
one
when
philip
of
anjou
went
to
spain
louis
xiv
by
letters
patent
conditionally
reserved
the
succession
to
the
spanish
throne
to
france
thus
virtually
uniting
the
two
countries
so
that
the
pyrenees
mountains
would
no
longer
have
any
political
meaning
as
a
boundary
between
the
two
countries
louis
at
once
put
french
garrisons
in
the
border
towns
of
the
spanish
netherlands
and
he
thus
had
a
force
ready
at
any
moment
to
march
across
the
frontier
into
holland
finally
on
the
death
of
the
royal
refugee
james
ii
which
occurred
shortly
before
king
william
death
louis
xiv
publicly
acknowledged
the
exiled
son
james
edward
the
old
pretender
as
rightful
sovereign
of
england
scotland
and

this
effectually
roused
the
english
people
they
were
prepared
for
hostilities
when
william
sudden
death
occurred
immediately
after
anne
came
to
the
throne
war
with
france
was
declared
and
since
it
had
grown
out
of
louis
designs
on
the
crown
of
spain
it
was
called
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
the
contest
was
begun
by
england
mainly
to
prevent
the
french
king
from
carrying
out
his
threat
of
placing
the
pretender
son
of
the
late
james
ii
on
the
english
throne
and
so
overturning
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
act
of
settlement
and
thereby
restoring
the
country
to
the
roman
catholic
stuarts
later
the
war
came
to
have
two
other
important
objects
the
first
of
these
was
to
defend
holland
now
a
most
valuable
ally
the
second
was
to
protect
the
colonies
of
virginia
and
new
england
against
the
power
of
france
which
threatened
through
its
own
american
colonies
and
through
the
extensive
spanish
possessions
it
expected
to
acquire
to
get
control
of
the
whole
of
the
new
world
at
this
time
england
had
twelve
american
colonies
extending
from
new
england
to
south
carolina
inclusive
with
part
of
newfoundland
france
and
spain
claimed
all
the
rest
of
the
continent
thus
england
had
three
objects
at
stake
the
maintenance
of
protestant
government
at
home
the
maintenance
of
the
protestant
power
of
holland
the
retention
of
a
large
part
of
the
american
continent
for
this
reason
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
may
be
regarded
as
the
beginning
of
a
second
hundred
years
war
between
england
and
france
one
destined
to
decide
which
was
to
build
up
the
great
empire
of
the
future
in
the
western
hemisphere
during
the
next
eighty
years
fighting
was
going
on
between

and

or
indirectly

commanded
the

forces
and

for
his
ally

the
duke
who
was
known
in
the
enemy
camps
by
the
flattering
name
of
the
handsome
englishman
had
risen
from
obscurity
he
owed
the
beginning
of
his
success
to
his
good
looks
and
a
court
intrigue
in
politics
he
sympathized
chiefly
with
the
tories
but
his
interests
in
the
war
led
him
to
support
the
whigs
he
was
avaricious
unscrupulous
and
teacherous
james
ii
trusted
him
and
he
deceived
him
and
went
over
to
william
william
trusted
him
and
he
deceived
him
and
opened
a
treasonable
correspondence
with
the
dethroned
james
anne
trusted
him
and
he
would
undoubtedly
have
betrayed
her
if
the
pretender
had
been
able
to
bid
high
enough
or
if
he
could
have
shown
him
that
his
cause
was
likely
to
be
successful
in
his
greed
for
money
the
duke
hesitated
at
nothing
he
took
bribes
from
army
contractors
and
robbed
his
soldiers
of
their
pay
see
hallam
macaulay
and

henry
esmond
as
a
soldier
marlborough
had
no
equal
voltaire
says
of
him
with
truth
that
he
never
besieged
a
fortress
which
he
did
not
take
nor
fought
a
battle
which
he
did
not
win

man
at

and
so
false

or
principle
now
opened

campaign
he
captured
those
fortresses
in
the
spanish
netherlands
which
louis
xiv
had
garrisoned
with
french
troops
to
menace
holland
but
he
could
not
induce

enemy
to
rish

marlborough
by

brilliant
movement
changed
the
scene
of
the
war
from
the
netherlands
to
bavaria
in
southern
germany
there
at
the
little
village
of
blenheim
he
with
prince
eugene
gained
a
victory
over
the
french
which
saved
germany
from
the
power
of
louis
xiv
see

opposite
england
out
of
gratitude
for
the
humiliation
of
her
powerful
enemy
presented
the
duke
with
the
ancient
royal
park
of
woodstock
near
oxford
and
built
for
him
the
palace
of
blenheim
which
the
architect
called
the
biggest
house
for
the
biggest
man
in
england
it
is
still
occupied
by
descendants
of
the
duke
family
a
few
days
before
the
battle
of
blenheim
a
powerful
english
fleet
had
attacked
and
taken
gibraltar
england
thus
gained
and
still
holds
the
command
of
the
great
inland
sea
of
the
mediterranean
in
the
course
of
the
next
five
years
marlborough
fought
three
great
battles
by
which
he
drove
the
french
out
of
the
netherlands
once
for
all
and
finally
beat
them
on
a
hotly
contested
field
in
northern
france
the
power
of
louis
xiv
was
now
so
far
broken
that
england
no
longer
felt
any
fear
that
he
would
overcome
her
colonies
in

blenheim
the

grounds
are
nearly
twelve
miles

against

but
if
the
duke
of
marlborough
was
remarkable
so
too
was
his
wife
while
the
war
was
going
on
the
real
power
of
the
crown
though
it
stood
in
anne
name
was
practically
in
the
hands
of
sarah
jennings
duchess
of
marlborough
who
held
the
office
of
mistress
of
the
robes
she
and
the
queen
had
long
been
inseparable
and
it
was
her
influence
that
cause
anne
to
desert
her
father
and
espouse
the
cause
of
william
of
orange
the
imperious
temper
of
the
duchess
carried
all
before
it
and
in
her
department
she
won
victories
which
might
well
be
compared
with
those
the
duke
her
husband
gained
on
the
field
of
battle
in
time
her
sway
over
her
royal
companion
grew
to
be
so
absolute
that
she
seemed
to
decide
everything
from
questions
of
state
to
the
cut
of
a
gown
or
the
color
of
a
ribbon
finally
it
became
a
common
saying
that
queen
anne
reigns
but
queen
sarah
governs
for
years
the
queen
and
the
duchess
corresponded
almost
daily
under
the
names
of
morley
the
queen
and
freeman
the
duchess
the
latter
taking
that
name
because
she
said
it
suited
the
frank
and
bold
character
of
her
letters
while
the
duchess
continued
in
power
she
used
her
influence
to
urge
forward
the
war
with
france
undertaken
by
england
to
check
the
designs
of
louis
xiv
on
spain
and
holland
and
also
to
punish
him
for
his
recognition
of
the
claim
of
the
pretender
to
the
english
crown
her
object
was
to
advance
her
husband
who
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
english
and
dutch
forces
on
the
continent
had
won
fame
and
fortune
the
first
by
his
splendid
ability
the
second
by
his
unscrupulous
greed
after
a
number
of
years
the
queen
and
the
duchess
quarreled
and
the
latter
was
superseded
by
her
cousin
a
masham
who
soon
got
as
complete
control
of
anne
as
the
former
favorite
had
possessed
masham
was
as
sly
and
supple
as
the
duchess
had
been
dictatorial
and
violent
she
was
cousin
to
robert
harley
a
prominent
tory
politician
through
her
influence
harley
now
became
prime
minister
in
everything
but
name
he
succeeded
in
putting
a
stop
to
further
fighting
and
marlborough
was
ordered
home
in
disgrace
on
a
charge
of
having
robbed
the
government
thus
it
was
as
hallam
remarks
that
the
fortunes
of
europe
were
changed
by
the
insolence
of
one
waiting
woman
and
the
cunning
of
another
sacheverell
an
incident
occurred
about
this
time
which
greatly
helped
the
tories
in
their
schemes
sacheverell
a
violent
tory
and
high
churchman
began
preaching
a
series
of
vehement
sermons
in
london
condemning
the
whig
policy
which
called
for
the
reopening
of
the
war
he
also
endeavored
to
revive
the
exploding
theory
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
and
declared
that
no
tyranny
on
the
part
of
a
sovereign
could
by
any
possibility
justify
a
subject
in
resisting
the
royal
will
the
whig
leaders
brought
the
preacher
to
trial
for
alleged
treasonable
utterances
he
was
suspended
from
his
office
for
three
years
and
his
book
of
sermons
was
publicly
burned
by
the
common
hangman
this
created
intense
popular
excitement
sacheverell
was
regarded
as
a
political
martyr
by
all
who
wished
the
war
ended
a
reaction
against
the
government
set
in
the
whigs
were
driven
from
power
and
the
tories
passed
two
very
harsh
laws
against
dissenters
though
they
were
repealed
a
few
years
later
the
duchess
of
marlborough
had
to
leave
her
apartments
in
the
palace
of
james
and
in
her
spite
broke
down
marble
mantels
and
tore
off
the
locks
from
doors
masham
friends
the
tories
or
peace
party
who
had
now
triumphed
prepared
to
put
a
complete
end
to
the
fighting
these
were
the
occasional
conformity
act
and
the
schism
act
the
peace
of
utrecht
not
long
after
this
change
a
messenger
was
privately
dispatched
to
louis
xiv
to
ask
if
he
wished
for
peace
it
was
says
the
french
minister
like
asking
a
dying
man
whether
he
would
wish
to
be
cured
later
terms
were
secretly
agreed
upon
between
the
tories
and
the
french
and
in
in
the
quaint
dutch
city
of
utrecht
the
allies
together
with
france
and
spain
signed
the
treaty
bearing
that
name
morris
the
age
of
anne
by
it
louis
xiv
bound
himself
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
england
to
limit
the
succession
to
the
crown
to
protestant
sovereigns
to
compel
prince
james
edward
the
pretender
to
quit
france
to
renounce
the
union
of
the
crowns
of
france
and
spain
but
philip
was
to
retain
the
spanish
throne
to
cede
to
england
all
claims
to
newfoundland
acadia
or
nova
scotia
and
that
vast
region
known
as
the
hudson
bay
possessions
next
spain
was
to
give
up
the
spanish
netherlands
to
austria
an
ally
of
holland
and
grant
to
the
dutch
a
line
of
forts
to
defend
their
frontier
against
france
england
was
to
have
the
exclusive
right
for
years
of
supplying
the
colonists
with
negro
slaves
this
right
called
the
assiento
or
contract
had
formerly
belonged
to
france
by
its
transfer
england
got
the
privilege
of
furnishing
sound
merchantable
negroes
annually
two
thirds
to
be
males
between
ten
and
forty
years
of
age
this
trade
had
long
been
coveted
by
the
english
and
had
been
carried
on
to
some
extent
by
them
ever
since
sir
john
hawkins
entered
upon
it
in
queen
elizabeth
reign
sir
john
grew
very
rich
through
his
traffic
in
human
flesh
and
he
set
up
a
coat
of
arms
emblazoned
with
a
slave
in
fetters
so
that
all
might
see
how
he
had
won
wealth
and
distinction
union
of
england
and
scotland
since
the
accession
of
james
i
england
and
scotland
had
been
ruled
by
one
sovereign
but
each
country
retained
its
own
parliament
and
its
own
forms
of
worship
in
the
two
countries
were
finally
united
under
the
name
of
great
britain
the
established
presbyterian
church
of
scotland
and
the
scottish
laws
were
to
be
preserved
the
independent
parliament
of
scotland
was
given
up
and
the
scotch
were
henceforth
represented
in
the
english
parliament
by
sixteen
peers
chosen
by
members
of
the
scottish
peerage
at
the
summoning
of
every
parliament
and
by
now
two
members
returned
by
scotland
to
the
house
of
commons
with
the
consummation
of
the
union
between
the
two
countries
great
britain
adopted
a
new
flag
the
union
jack
which
was
formed
by
the
junction
of
the
red
cross
of
george
of
england
and
the
white
cross
of
andrew
of
scotland
after
ireland
was
united
to
great
britain
the
red
cross
of
patrick
was
added
to
the
flag
the
first
union
jack
was
the
work
of
james
i
whose
usual
signature
was
jacques
hence
jack
french
for
james
literature
of
the
period
the
first
daily
paper
the
reign
of
anne
has
been
characterized
as
one
of
corruption
in
high
places
and
of
brutality
in
low
but
in
literature
it
takes
rank
next
to
that
of
elizabeth
there
was
indeed
no
great
central
luminary
like
shakespeare
but
a
constellation
of
lesser
ones
such
as
addison
defoe
and
pope
they
shone
with
a
splendor
of
their
own
the
lurid
brilliancy
of
the
satirist
dean
swift
was
beginning
to
command
attention
on
the
other
hand
the
calm
clear
light
of
the
philosopher
john
locke
was
near
its
setting
aside
from
these
great
names
in
letters
it
was
an
age
generally
of
contented
dullness
well
represented
in
the
mediocrity
of
queen
anne
herself
during
her
reign
the
first
daily
newspaper
appeared
in
england
the
daily
courant
it
was
a
dingy
badly
printed
little
sheet
not
much
bigger
than
a
man
hand
the
publisher
said
he
made
it
so
small
to
save
the
publick
at
least
one
half
the
impertinences
of
ordinary
perhaps
it
was
well
this
journal
set
up
no
greater
pretensions
for
it
had
to
compete
with
swarms
of
abusive
political
pamphlets
such
as
swift
wrote
for
the
tories
and
defoe
for
the
whigs
it
had
also
to
compete
with
the
gossip
and
scandal
of
the
coffeehouses
and
the
clubs
for
this
reason
the
proprietor
found
it
no
easy
matter
either
to
fill
it
or
to
sell
it
a
few
years
later
a
periodical
appeared
called
the
spectator
it
was
published
daily
and
addison
its
chief
contributor
soon
made
it
famous
each
number
consisted
of
an
essay
hitting
off
the
follies
and
foibles
of
the
age
and
it
was
regularly
served
at
the
breakfast
tables
of
people
of
fashion
along
with
their
tea
and
toast
one
of
the
greatest
merits
of
the
spectator
was
its
happy
way
of
showing
that
wit
and
virtue
are
after
all
better
friends
than
wit
and
vice
neither
this
little
magazine
nor
the
newspapers
of
that
time
dared
to
publish
a
single
line
of
parliamentary
debate
but
they
marked
the
humble
beginning
of
that
vast
organized
power
represented
by
the
daily
press
of
london
which
discusses
everything
of
interest
throughout
the
world
death
of
the
queen
the
ingratitude
of
public
men
and
the
furious
quarrels
of
politicians
so
teased
and
vexed
the
queen
that
she
at
last
fell
into
a
fatal
illness
her
physician
wrote
to
dean
swift
i
believe
sleep
was
never
more
welcome
to
a
weary
traveler
than
death
was
to
her
when
she
laid
down
the
scepter
she
left
no
heir
to
the
throne
and
so
the
power
of
the
stuarts
came
to
an
end
according
to
the
terms
of
the
act
of
settlement
the
crown
now
passed

george
elector
of
hanover
a
protestant
descendant

james
edward

to

that
his
queen
anne
would
name
him
her
successor
instead
of
that
it
was
she
who
first
dubbed
him
the
pretender
anne
and
the
pretender
were
children
of
james

by
different
mothers
summary
the
whole
reign
of
anne
was
taken
up
with
the
strife
of
political
parties
at
home
and
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
abroad
the
whigs
were
always
intriguing
through
the
duchess
of
marlborough
and
other
leaders
to
keep
up
the
war
and
to
keep
out
the
pretender
the
tories
on
the
other
hand
were
just
as
busy
through
masham
and
her
coadjutors
in
endeavoring
to
establish
peace
and
with
it
the
divine
right
of

the
extreme
tories
hoped
for
the
restoration
of
the
roman
catholic
stuarts
in
the
person

customs

modes
of

the

character
of
the
new
king
the
new
sovereign
was
a
selfish
coarse
old
man
who
in
private
life
would
as
lady
montagu
said
have
passed
for
an
honest
blockhead
he
neither
knew
anything
about
england
nor
did
he
desire
to
know
anything
of
it
he
could
not
speak
a
word
of
the
language
of
the
country
he
was
called
to
govern
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
learn
it
even
the
coronation
service
had
to
be
explained
to
him
as
best
it
might
in
such
broken
latin
as
the
ministers
could
muster
laboring
under
these
disadvantages
he
wisely
declined
to
take
any
active
part
in
the
affairs
of
the
nation
he
trusted
everything
to
his
whig
friends
and
let
them
with
sir
robert
walpole
at
their
head
manage
the
country
in
their
own
way
forunately
the
great
body
of
the
english
people
were
abundantly
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
a
noted
french
writer
said
of
them
that
they
resembled
a
barrel
of
their
own
beer
froth
at
the
top
dregs
at
the
bottom
but
thoroughly
sound
and
wholesome
in
the
middle
it
was
this
middle
class
with
their
solid
practical
good
sense
that
kept
the
nation
right
they
were
by
no
means
enthusiastic
worshipers
of
the
german
king
who
had
come
to
reign
over
them
but
they
saw
that
he
had
three
good
qualities
he
was
no
hypocrite
he
did
not
waste
the
people
money
and
he
was
a
man
of
unquestioned
courage
but
they
also
saw
more
than
this
for
they
realized
that
though
george
i
might
be
as
heavy
dull
and
wooden
as
the
figurehead
of
an
ship
yet
like
that
figurehead
he
stood
for
something
greater
and
better
than
himself
for
he
represented
protestantism
with
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
so
the
people
gave
him
their
allegiance
rise
of
cabinet
government
the
first
prime
minister
the
present
method
of
cabinet
government
dates
in
great
part
from
this
reign
from
the
earliest
period
of
english
history
the
sovereign
was
accustomed
to
have
a
permanent
council
composed
of
some
of
the
chief
men
of
the
realm
whom
he
consulted
on
all
matters
of
importance
charles
ii
either
because
he
found
this
body
inconveniently
large
for
the
rapid
transaction
of
business
or
because
he
believed
it
inexpedient
to
discuss
his
plans
with
so
many
selected
a
small
confidential
committee
from
it
this
committee
met
to
consult
with
the
king
in
his
cabinet
or
private
room
and
so
came
to
be
called
the
cabinet
council
or
briefly
the
cabinet
a
name
which
it
has
ever
since
retained
during
charles
ii
reign
and
that
of
his
immediate
successors
the
king
continued
to
choose
this
special
council
from
those
whom
he
believed
to
be
friendly
to
his
measures
often
without
much
regard
to
party
lines
and
he
was
aways
present
at
their
meetings
with
the
accession
of
george
i
however
a
great
change
took
place
his
want
of
acquaintance
with
prominent
men
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
select
a
cabinet
himself
and
his
ignorance
of
english
rendered
his
presence
at
its
meetings
wholly
useless
for
these
reasons
the
new
king
adopted
the
expedient
of
appointing
a
chief
adviser
or
prime
minister
who
personally
chose
his
own
cabinet
from
men
of
the
political
party
to
which
he
belonged
sir
robert
walpole
who
held
this
office
of
chief
adviser
for
more
than
twenty
years
is
commonly
considered
to
have
been
the
first
actual
prime
minister
and
the
founder
of
that
system
of
cabinet
government
which
prevails
in
england
he
was
a
master
hand
at
managing
his
fellow
ministers
in
the
cabinet
and
when
one
of
them
named
townshend
aspired
to
share
the
leadership
walpole
said
to
him
the
firm
must
be
walpole
and
townshend
not
townshend
and
walpole
but
later
a
minority
in
the
lords
protested
that
a
sole
or
even
first
minister
is
an
officer
unknown
to
the
law
of
britain
inconsistent
withthe
constitution
of
this
country
and
destructive
of
liberty
in
any
government
whatsoever
then
walpole
thought
it
expedient
to
disclaim
the
title
but
many
years
later
the
younger
pitt
declared
that
there
ought
to
be
an
avowed
minister
possessing
the
chief
weight
in
the
council
or
cabinet
and
that
view
eventually
prevailed
the
cabinet
or
government
as
it
is
usually
called
generally
consists
of
twelve
or
fifteen
persons
chosen
by
the
prime
minister
or
premier
from
the
leading
members
of
both
houses
of
parliament
but
whose
political
views
agree
in
the
main
with
the
majority
of
the
house
of
commons
but
this
system
as
it
now
stands
was
gradually
developed
it
had
advanced
to
such
a
point
under
the
dictatorial
rule
of
sir
robert
walpole
that
george
ii
chafing
under
the
restriction
of
his
power
said
bitterly
in
england
the
ministers
are
king
george
iii
however
succeeded
for
a
time
in
making
himself
practically
supreme
but
cabinet
government
soon
came
to
the
front
again
and
under
william
iv
the
prime
minister
with
his
cabinet
ceased
to
look
to
the
sovereign
for
guidance
and
support
and
became
responsible
to
the
house
of
commons

body

so
likewise

he
was

but
the

by
his
enemies
the
insurrection
was
led
by
john
earl
of
mar
who
from
his
frequent
change
of
politics
had
got
the
nickname
of
bobbing
john
mar
encountered
the
royal
forces
at
sheriffmuir
in
perthsire
scotland
where
an
indecisive
battle
was
fought
which
the
old
ballad
thus
describes
there
some
say
that
we
won
and
some
say
that
they
won
and
some
say
that
none
won
at
a
man
but
one
thing
is
sure
that
at
sheriffmuir
a
battle
there
was
which
i
saw
man
the
chevalier
de
george
after
the
birth
of
the
chevalier
son
charles
in
the
father
was
known
by
the
nickname
of
the
old
pretender
and
the
son
as
the
young
pretender
so
far
as
birth
could
entitle
them
to
the
crown
they
held
the
legal
right
of
succession
but
the
revolution
of
and
the
act
of
settlement
barred
them
out
on
the
same
day
of
the
fight
at
sheriffmuir
the
english
jacobites
with
a
body
of
scotch
allies
marched
into
preston
lancashire
and
there
surrendered
almost
without
striking
a
blow
the
leaders
of
the
movement
except
the
earl
of
mar
who
with
one
or
two
others
escaped
to
the
continent
were
beheaded
or
hanged
and
about
a
thousand
of
the
rank
and
file
were
sold
as
slaves
to
the
west
india
and
virginia
plantations
the
pretender
himself
landed
in
scotland
a
few
weeks
after
the
defeat
of
his
friends
but
finding
no
encouragement
he
hurried
back
to
the
continent
again
thus
ended
the
rebellion
known
from
the
year
of
its
outbreak
as
the
fifteen
one
result
of
this
was
the
passage
of
the
septennial
act
extending
the
duration
of
parliament
from
three
years
which
was
the
longest
time
that
body
could
sit
to
seven
years
since
reduced
to
five
years
the
object
of
this
change
was
to
do
away
with
the
excitement
and
tendency
to
rebellion
at
that
time
resulting
from
frequent
elections
in
which
party
feeling
ran
to
dangerous
extremes
the
triennial
act
provided
that
at
the
end
of
three
years
parliament
must
be
dissolved
and
a
new
election
held
this
was
to
prevent
the
sovereign
from
keeping
that
body
in
power
indefinitely
contrary
perhaps
to
the
political
feeling
of
the
country
which
might
prefer
a
different
set
of
representatives
under
the
septennial
act
the
time
was
extended
four
years
making
seven
in
all
but
the
sovereign
may
of
course
dissolve
parliament
at
any
time
in
the
parliament
act
limited
the
duration
of
parliament
to
five
years
the
south

a
few
years
later
a
gigantic
enterprise
was
undertaken
by
the
south

company
a
body
of
merchants
originally
organized
as

company
trading
in

atlantic
and

a
scotchman
named

had
started
a
similar
project
in
france
known
as
the

which
proposed
to
pay
off
the
national
debt
of

from
the
profits
of
its
commerce
with
the
west
indies
and
the
country
bordering
on

river
following
his
example
the
south

company
now
undertook
to
pay
off
the
english
national
debt

is
said
from
the
profits
of
the
slave
trade
between

and

sir
robert
walpole
had
no
faith
in
the
scheme
and
attacked
it
vigorously
but
other
influential
members
of
the
government
gave
it
their
encouragement

directors
came
out
with
prospectuses
promising

of

things
which
the

were
to
try
in
that
century
was
one
which
led
to
most
beneficient
results
for
many
generations
the
great
scourge
of
europe
was
the
smallpox
often
the
disease
was
as
violent
as
the
plague
and
carried
off
nearly
as
many
victims
medical
art
seemed
powerless
to
deal
with
it
and
even
in
years
of
ordinary
health
in
england
about
one
person
out
of
ten
died
of
this
loathsome
pestilence
in
the
early
part
of
george
i
reign
lady
mary
montagu
then
traveling
to
turkey
wrote
that
the
turks
were
in
the
habit
of
inoculating
their
children
for
the
disease
which
rendered
it
much
milder
and
less
fatal
and
that
she
was
about
to
try
the
experiment
on
her
own
son
later
lady
montagu
returned
to
england
and
through
her
influence
and
example
the
practice
was
introduced
there
it
was
tried
first
on
five
criminals
in
newgate
who
had
been
sentenced
to
the
gallows
but
were
promised
their
freedom
if
they
would
consent
to
the
operation
as
it
proved
a
complete
success
the
princess
of
wales
with
the
king
consent
caused
it
to
be
tried
on
her
daughter
with
equally
good
results
the
medical
profession
however
generally
refused
to
sanction
the
practice
and
the
clergy
in
many
cases
preached
against
it
as
an
invention
of
satan
intended
to
counteract
the
purposes
of
an
providence
but
through
the
perseverance
and
good
sense
of
lady
montagu
with
a
few
others
the
new
practice
gradually
gained
ground
subsequently
jenner
began
to
make
experiments
of
a
different
kind
which
led
late
in
the
century
to
the
discovery
of
vaccination
by
which
millions
of
lives
have
been
saved
this
and
the
discovery
of
the
use
of
ether
in
our
own
time
may
justly
be
called
two
of
the
greatest
triumphs

the
first
prime
minister
in
and
that
he
continued
in
office
as
head
of
the
cabinet
or
government
until
near
the
middle
of
the
next
reign
he
was
an
able
financier
and
succeeded
in
reducing
the
national
debt
he
believed
in
keeping
the
country
out
of
war
and
also
as
we
have
seen
out
of
bubble
speculation
finally
he
was
determined
at
all
cost
to
maintain
the
whig
party
in
power
and
the
protestant
hanoverian
sovereigns
on
the
throne
in
order
to
accomplish
these
objects
he
openly
bribed
members
of
parliament
to
support
his
party
he
bought
votes
and
carried
elections
by
gifts
of
titles
honors
and
bank
notes
he
thus
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
the
truth
of
his
theory
that
most
men
have
their
price
and
that
an
appeal
to
the
pocketbook
is
both
quicker
and
surer
than
an
appeal
to
the
principle
but
before
the
end
of
his
ministry
he
had
to
confess
that
he
had
found
in
the
house
of
commons
a
boy
patriot
as
he
sneeringly
called
him
named
william
pitt
afterward
earl
of
chatham
whom
neither
his
money
could
buy
nor
his
ridicule
move
bad
as
walpole
policy
was
in
its
corrupting
influence
on
the
nation
it
as
an
admission
that
the
time
had
come
when
the
king
could
no
longer
venture
to
rule
by
force
as
in
hte
days
of
the
stuarts
it
meant
that
the
crown
no
longer
possessed
the
arbitrary
power
it
once
wielded
walpole
was
a
fox
not
a
lion
and
foxes
as
emerson
tells
us
are
so
cunning
because
they
are
not
strong
summary
though
george
i
did
little
for
england
except
keep
the
pretender
from
the
throne
by
occupying
it
himself
yet
that
was
no
small
advantage
since
it
gave
the
country
peace
the
establishment
of
cabinet
government
under
sir
robert
walpole
as
the
first
prime
minister
the
suppression
of
the
jacobite
insurrection
the
disastrous
collapse
of
the
south
sea
bubble
and
the
introduction
of
vaccination
are
the
principle
events
george
ii
accession
and
character
the
second
king
george
who
was
also
of
german
birth
was
much
like
his
father
though
he
had
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
speak
english
readily
but
with
a
strong
german
accent
his
tastes
were
far
from
being
refined
and
he
bluntly
declared
i
do
like
boetry
and
i
do
like
bainting
his
wife
queen
caroline
was
an
able
woman
she
possessed
the
happy
art
of
ruling
her
husband
without
his
suspecting
it
while
she
on
the
other
hand
was
ruled
by
sir
robert
walpole
whom
the
king
hated
but
whom
he
had
to
keep
as
prime
minister
george
ii
was
a
good
soldier
and
decidedly
preferred
war
to
peace
but
walpole
saw
clearly
that
the
peace
policy
was
best
for
the
nation
and
he
and
the
queen
managed
to
persuaded
the
king
not
to
draw
the
sword
the
war
of
jenkins
ear
at
the
end
of
twelve
years
however
trouble
arose
with
spain
according
to
the
london
newspapers
of
that
day
a
certain
captain
jenkins
while
cruising
or
more
probably
smuggling
in
the
west
indies
had
been
seized
by
the
spaniards
and
barbarously
maltreated
they
if
we
accept
his
tory
accused
him
of
attempting
to
land
english
goods
contrary
to
law
and
searched
his
ship
finding
nothing
against
him
they
vented
their
rage
and
disappointment
by
hanging
him
to
the
yardarm
of
his
vessel
until
he
was
nearly
dead
they
then
tore
off
one
of
his
ears
and
bade
him
take
it
to
the
king
of
england
with
their
compliments
jenkins
it
is
said
carefully
wrapped
up
his
ear
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
when
he
reached
england
he
went
straight
to
the
house
of
commons
drew
out
the
mutilated
ear
showed
it
to
the
house
and
demanded
justice
the
spanish
restrictions
on
english
trade
with
the
indies
and
south
america
had
long
been
a
source
of
ill
feeling
the
sight
of
jenkins
ear
brought
matters
to
a
climax
even
sir
robert
walpole
the
prime
minister
could
not
resist
the
clamor
for
vengeance
and
contrary
to
his
own
judgment
he
had
to
vote
for
war
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
one
english
ship
was
allowed
to
carry
slaves
once
a
year
to
the
colonies
of
spanish
america
note
though
jenkins
was
the
occasion
the
real
object
of
the
war
was
to
compel
spain
to
permit
the
english
to
get
a
larger
share
in
the
lucrative
commerce
especially
the
slave
trade
with
the
new
world
it
was
another
proof
that
america
was
now
rapidly
becoming
an
important
factor
in
he
politics
of
great
britain
the
announcement
of
hostilities
with
spain
was
received
in
london
with
delight
and
bells
pealed
from
every
steeple
yes
said
walpole
they
may
ring
the
bells
now
but
before
long
they
will
be
wringing
their
hands
this
prediction
was
verified
by
the
heavy
losses
the
english
suffered
in
an
expedition
against
the
spanish
settlement
of
carthagena
south
america
but
later
the
british
commander
commodore
anson
inflicted
great
damage
on
the
spanish
colonies
and
returned
to
england
with
vessels
laden
with
large
amounts
of

his
daughter

theresa
succeeded
to
the
austrian

france
now
united
with
spain
prussia
and
other
european
powers
to
overturn
this
arrangement
partly
out
of
jealousy
of
the
austrian
power
and
partly
from
desire
to
get
control
of
portions
of
the
austrian
possessions
england
and
holland
however
both
desired
to
maintain
austria
as
a
check
against
their
old
enemy
france
and
declared
war
during
this
war
george
ii
went
over
to
the
continent
to
lead
the
english
forces
in
person
he
was
not
a
man
of
commanding
appearance
but
he
was
every
inch
a
soldier
and
nothing
exhilarated
him
like
the
smell
of
gunpowder
at
the
battle
of
dettingen
in
bavaria
he
got
down
from
his
horse
and
drawing
his
sword
cried
come
boys
now
behave
like
men
and
the
french
will
soon
run
with
that
followed
by
his
troops
he
rused
upon
the
enemy
with
such
impetuosity
that
they
turned
and
fled
this
was
the
last
battle
in
which
an
english
king
took
part
in
person
it
was
followed
by
that
of
fontenoy
in

to
make

landed
on

with
only
seven
followers
but
with
the
aid
of
the
scotch
jacobites
of
the

he
gained
a
battle
over
the
english
at
prestonpans
near
edinburgh
emboldened
by
his
success
he
now
marched
into
derbyshire
england
on

way
to

he
hoped
that
as
he
advanced
the
country
would
rise
in

favor

finding
no
support
he
retreated
to
scotland
the
next

he
and

of

up

of
the

reckoning
time
the
aggressive
designs
of

the
great
of

caused

that

was
formed
by

to
check
his

great

however
gave

of
humbling
her
old
enemy

who
in

her
attempts
to
oust
the
english
from

was
also
making
preparations
on
a
grand
scale
to
get
possession
of

the
new
style
was
introduced
into

britain
in
owing
to
a
slight
error
in
the
calendar
the
year
had
in
the
course
of
centuries
been
gradually
losing
so
that
in
it
was
eleven
days
short
of
what
the
true
computation
would
make
it
pope
gregory
corrected
the
error
in
and
his
calendar
was
adopted
in
nearly
every
country
of
europe
except
great
britain
and
russia
both
of
which
regarded
the
change
as
a
popish
measure
but
in
notwithstanding
the
popular
outcry
september
was
made
september
by
an
act
of
parliament
and
by
the
same
act
the
beginning
of
the
legal
year
was
altered
from
march
to
january
the
popular
clamor
against
the
reform
is
illustrated
in
picture
of
an
election
feast
in
which
the
people
party
carry
a
banner
with
the
inscription
give
us
back
our
eleven
days
every
victory
therefore
which
the
british
forces
could
gain
in
europe
would
by
crippling
the
french
make
the
ultimate
victory
of
the
english
in
america
so
much
the
more
certain
for
this
reason
we
may
look
upon
the
alliance
with
frederick
as
an
indirect
means
employed
by
england
to
protect
her
colonies
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
these
colonies
now
extended
along
the
entire
coast
from
the
kennebec
riber
in
maine
to
the
borders
of
florida
the
french
on
the
other
hand
had
planted
colonies
at
quebec
and
montreal
on
the
lawrence
at
detroit
on
the
great
lakes
at
new
orleans
and
other
points
on
the
mississippi
they
had
also
begun
to
build
a
line
of
forts
along
the
ohio
river
which
when
completed
would
connect
their
northern
and
southern
colonies
and
thus
secure
to
them
the
whole
country
west
of

alleghenies
they
expected
to
conquer

of
george
ii
was
morally
torpid
with
the
exception
of
a
few
public
men
like
pitt
the
majority
of
the
whig
party
seemed
animated
by
no
higher
motive
than
it
was
an
age
whose
want
of
faith
coarseness
and
brutality
were
well
protrayed
by
hogarth
pencil
and
fielding
pen
for
a
long
time
intemperance
had
been
steadily
on
the
increase
strong
drink
had
taken
the
place
of
beer
and
every
attempt
to
restrict
the
traffic
was
met
at
the
elections
by
the
popular
cry
no
gin
no
king
the
london
taverns
were
thronged
day
and
night
and
in
the
windows
of
those
frequented
by
the
lowest
class
placards
were
exhibited
with
the
tempting
announcement
drunk
for
a
penny
dead
drunk
for
twopence
clean
straw
for
nothing
on
the
straw
lay
men
and
women
in
beastly
helplessness
among
the
upper
classes
matters
were
hardly
better
it
was
a
common
thing
for
great
statesmen
to
drink
at
public
dinners
until
one
by
one
they
slid
out
of
their
seats
and
disappeared
under
the
table
and
sir
robert
walpole
the
late
prime
minister
of
england
said
that
when
he
was
a
young
man
his
father
would
say
to
him
as
he
poured
out
the
wine
come
robert
you
shall
drink
twice
while
i
drink
once
for
i
will
not
permit
the
son
in
his
sober
senses
to
be
witness
of
the
intoxication
of
his
father
coxe
memoirs
of
walpole
and
lecky
england
such
was
the
condition
of
england
when
a
great
religious
revival
began
its
leader
was
john
wesley
a
number
of
years
earlier
while
a
tutor
at
oxford
he
and
his
brother
charles
with
a
few
others
were
accustomed
to
meet
at
certain
hours
for
devotional
exercises
the
regularity
of
their
meetings
and
of
their
habits
generally
got
for
them
the
name
of
methodists
which
like
quaker
and
many
another
nickname
of
the
kind
was
destined
to
become
a
title
of
respect
and
honor
at
first
wesley
had
no
intention
of
separating
from
the
church
of
england
but
labored
only
to
quicken
it
to
new
life
eventually
however
he
found
it
best
to
begin
a
more
extended
and
independent
movement
the
revival
swept
over
england
with
its
regenerating
influence
and
was
carried
by
whitefield
wesley
lifelong
friend
across
the
sea
to
america
it
was
especially
powerful
among
those
who
had
hitherto
scoffed
at
both
church
and
bible
rough
and
hardened
men
were
touched
and
melted
to
tears
of
repentance
by
the
fervor
of
this
oxford
graduate
whom
neither
threats
nor
ridicule
could
turn
aside
from
his
one
great
purpose
of
saving
souls
unlike
the
church
wesley
did
not
ask
the
multitude
to
come
to
him
he
went
to
them
in
this
respect
his
work
recalls
that
of
the
begging
friars
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
of
wycliffe
poor
priests
in
the
fourteenth
for
more
than
thirty
years
he
rode
on
horseback
from
one
end
of
england
to
the
other
making
known
the
glad
tidings
of
christian
hope
he
preached
in
the
fields
under
trees
which
are
still
known
by
the
expressive
name
of
gospel
oaks
he
spoke
in
the
abandoned
mining
pits
of
cornwall
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
in
cities
on
the
docks
in
the
slums
in
fact
wherever
he
could
find
listening
ears
and
responsive
hearts
the
power
of
wesley
appeal
was
like
that
of
the
great
puritan
movement
of
the
seventeenth
century
nothing
more
effective
had
been
heard
since
the
days
when
augustine
and
his
band
of
monks
set
forth
on
their
mission
among
the
barbarous
saxons
the
results
answered
fully
to
the
zeal
that
awakened
them
better
than
the
growing
prosperity
of
extending
commerce
better
than
all
the
conquests
made
by
the
british
flag
in
the
east
or
west
was
the
new
religious
spirit
which
stirred
the
people
of
both
england
and
america
it
provoked
the
national
church
to
emulation
in
good
works
it
planted
schools
checked
intemperance
and
brought
into
vigorous
activity
whatever
was
best
and
bravest
in
a
race
that
when
true
to
itself
is
excelled
by
none
summary
the
history
of
the
reign
may
be
summed
up
in
the
great
religious
movement
begun
by
john
wesley
which
has
just
been
described
and
in
the
asiatic

and

to
be

but
beneath
this
spirit

there
was
a
moral
principle
in
being
king
george
iii
intended
to
carry
out
a
reform
such
as
neither
george
i
nor
george
ii
could
have
accomplished
supposing
that
either
one
had
possessed
the
desire
to
undertake
it
the
great
whig
families
of
rank
and
wealth
had
now
held
uninterrupted
possession
of
the
government
for
nearly
half
a
century
their
influence
was
so
supreme
that
the
sovereign
had
practically
become
a
mere
cipher
dependent
for
his
authority
on
the
political
support
which
he
received
the
king
was
resolved
that
this
state
of
things
should
continue
no
longer
he
was
determined
to
reassert
the
royal
authority
secure
a
government
which
should
reflect
his
principles
and
have
a
ministry
to
whom
he
could
dictate
instead
of
one
that
dictated
to
him
for
a
long
time
he
struggled
in
vain
but
at
last
succeeded
and
found
in
lord
north
a
prime
minister
who
bowed
to
the
royal
will
and
endeavored
to
carry
out
george
iii
favorite
policy
of
governing
for
but
never
by
the
people
that
policy
finally
called
forth
dunning
famous
resolution
in
the
house
of
commons
it
boldly
declared
the
king
influence
had
increased
was
increasing
and
ought
to
be
diminished
but
his
majesty
measures
had
other
consequences
which
were
more
and
disastrous
than
any
one
in
the
house
of
commons
then
imagined
taxation
of
the
american
colonies
the
wars
of
the
two
preceding
reigns
had
largely
increased
the
national
debt
and
the
government
resolved
to
compel
the
american
colonies
to
share
in
a
more
direct
degree
than
they
had
yet
done
the
constantly
increasing
burden
of
taxation
england
then
like
all
other
european
countries
regarded
her
colonies
in
a
totally
different
way
from
that
in
which
she
considers
the
colonies
she
now
holds
it
was
an
open
question
at
that
time
whether
colonial
legislative
rights
existed
save
as
a
matter
of
concession
or
favor
on
the
part
of
the
home
government
it
is
true
that
the
government
had
found
it
expedient
to
grant
or
recognize
such
rights
but
it
had
seldom
defined
them
clearly
and
in
many
important
respects
no
one
knew
just
what
the
settlers
of
virginia
or
massachusetts
might
or
might
not
lawfully
do
story
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
mother
country
however
was
perfectly
clear
on
three
points
that
the
american
colonies
were
convenient
receptacles
for
the
surplus
population
good
or
bad
of
the
british
islands
that
they
were
valuable
as
sources
of
revenue
and
profit
politically
and
commercially
that
finally
they
furnished
excellent
opportunities
for
the
king
friends
to
get
office
and
make
fortunes
such
had
long
been
the
feeling
about
india
and
such
too
was
the
feeling
modified
by
difference
of
circumstances
about
america
politically
the
english
colonists
in
america
enjoyed
a
large
measure
of
liberty
so
far
as
local
legislation
was
concerned
they
were
in
most
cases
preactically
and
independent
so
too
their
personal
rights
were
carefully
safeguarded
on
the
other
hand
the
commercial
policy
of
england
toward
her
colonies
though
severely
restrictive
was
far
less
so
than
that
of
spain
or
france
toward
theirs
the
navigation
laws
compelled
the
americans
to
confine
their
trade
to
england
alone
or
to
such
foreign
ports
as
she
directed
if
they
sent
a
hogshead
of
tobacco
or
a
barrel
of
salt
fish
to
another
country
by
any
but
an
english
or
a
colonial
built
bessel
they
were
legally
liable
to
forfeith
their
goods
on
the
other
hand
they
enjoyed
the
complete
monopoly
of
the
english
tobacco
market
and
in
certain
cases
they
received
bounties
on
some
of
their
products
furthermore
the
navigation
laws
had
not
been
rigidly
enforced
for
a
long
time
and
the
new
england
colonists
generally
treated
them
as
a
dead
letter
when
george
iii
came
to
the
throne
he
resolved
to
revive
the
enforcement
of
the
navigation
laws
to
build
up
the
british
west
indies
and
to
restrict
the
colonial
trade
with
the
spanish
and
french
west
indies
this
was
done
not
for
the
purpose
of
crippling
american
commerce
but
either
to
increase
english
revenue
or
to
inflict
injury
on
foreign
rivals
or
enemies
furthermore
british
manufacturers
had
at
an
earlier
period
induced
the
english
government
to
restrict
certain
american
home
manufactures
in
accordance
with
that
policy
parliament
had
enacted
statutes
which
virtually
forbade
the
colonists
making
their
own
woolen
cloth
or
their
own
beaver
hats
except
on
a
very
limited
scale
they
had
a
few
ironworks
but
they
were
forbidden
to
erect
another
furnace
or
another
mill
for
manufacturing
iron
rods
or
plates
and
such
industries
were
declared
to
be
a
nuisance
william
pitt
who
later
became
lord
chatham
was
one
of
the
warmest
friends
that
america
had
but
he
openly
advocated
this
narrow
policy
saying
that
if
british
interests
demanded
it
he
would
not
permit
the
colonists
to
make
so
much
as
a
horseshoe
nail
adam
smith
an
eminent
english
political
economist
of
that
day
vehemently
condemned
the
british
government
colonial
mercantile
system
as
suicidal
but
his
condemnation
came
too
late
to
have
any
effect
the
fact
was
that
the
world
was
not
ready
then
if
indeed
it
is
yet
to
receive
the
gospel
of
live
and
let
live
the
stamp
act
in
accordance
with
these
theories
about
the
colonies
and
to
meet
the
pressing
needs
of
the
home
government
the
english
ministry
proceeded
to
levy
a
tax
on
the
colonies
in
return
for
the
protection
they
granted
them
against
the
french
and
the
indians
the
colonists
however
had
paid
their
full
proportion
of
the
expense
of
the
french
and
indian
wars
out
of
their
own
pockets
and
they
now
felt
abundantly
able
to
protect
themselves
but
notwithstanding
this
plea
a
form
of
direct
tax
on
the
american
colonies
called
the
stamp
tax
was
brought
forward
in
the
proposed
law
required
that
a
multitude
of
legal
documents
such
as
deeds
wills
notes
receipts
and
the
like
should
be
written
upon
paper
bearing
stamps
purchased
from
the
agents
of
the
home
government
the
colonists
generally
protested
against
the
passage
of
the
law
and
benjamin
franklin
with
other
agents
was
sent
to
england
to
sustain
their
protests
by
argument
and
remonstrance
but
in
spite
of
their
efforts
the
law
was
passed
and
the
stamps
were
sent
over
to
america
the
people
however
refused
to
use
them
and
serious
riots
ensued
in
england
strong
sympathy
with
the
colonists
was
expressed
by
william
pitt
lord
chatham
burke
fox
and
generally
by
what
was
well
called
the
brains
of
parliament
pitt
in
particular
was
extremely
indignant
he
urged
the
immediate
repeal
of
the
act
saying
i
rejoice
that
america
has
resisted
pitt
further
declared
that
any
taxation
of
the
colonies
without
their
representation
in
parliament
was
tyranny
and
that
opposition
to
such
taxation
was
a
duty
he
vehemently
insisted
that
the
spirit
shown
by
the
americans
was
the
same
that
had
withstood
the
despotism
of
the
stuarts
in
england
and
established
the
principle
once
for
all
that
the
king
can
not
take
his
subject
money
without
that
consent
so
too
fox
ardently
defended
the
american
colonists
and
boldly
maintained
that
the
stand
they
had
taken
helped
to
preserve
the
liberties

the

was

amid
great
rejoicing
in
london
the
church
bells
rang
out
in
triumph
and
the
shipping
in
the
thames
was
illuminated
but
the
good
effect
on
america
was
lost
by
the
passage
of
another
act
which
maintained
the
unconditional
right
of
parliament
to
legislate
for
the
colonies
and
to
tax
them
if
it
saw
fit
without
their
consent
the
tea
tax
and
the
boston
tea
party
with
its
results
another
plan
was
now
devised
for
getting
money
from
the
colonies
parliament
enacted
a
law
compelling
the
americans
to
pay
taxes
on
a
number
of
imports
such
as
glass
paper
and
tea
in
opposition
to
this
law
the
colonists
formed
leagues
refusing
to
use
these
taxed
articles
while
at
the
same
time
they
encouraged
smugglers
to
land
them
secretly
and
the
regular
trade
suffered
accordingly
parliament
finding
that
this
was
bad
both
for
the
government
and
for
commerce
now
abolished
all
of
these
duties
except
that
on
tea
that
duty
was
retained
for
a
double
purpose
first
and
chiefly
to
maintain
the
principle
of
the
right
of
great
britain
to
tax
the
colonies
and
next
to
aid
the
east
india
company
which
was
pleading
piteeously
for
help
in
consequence
mainly
of
the
refusal
of
the
american
colonies
to
buy
tea
the
london
warehouses
of
the
east
india
company
were
full
to
overflowing
with
surplus
stock
and
the
company
itself
was
in
a
condition
the
custom
had
been
for
the
company
to
bring
the
tea
to
england
pay
a
tax
on
it
and
then
sell
it
to
be
reshipped
to
america
to
aid
the
company
in
its
embarrassment
the
government
now
agreed
to
remit
this
first
duty
altogether
and
to
impose
a
tax
of
only
threepence
six
cents
a
pound
on
the
consumers
in
america
in
itself
the
threepenny
tax
was
a
trifle
as
the
tax
of
twenty
shillnigs
was
to
john
hampden
but
underlying
it
was
a
principle
which
seemed
to
the
americans
as
it
had
seemed
to
hampden
no
trifle
for
such
principles
revolutions
had
been
fought
in
the
past
for
such
they
would
be
fought
in
the
future
the
colonists
resolved
not
to
have
the
tea
at
any
price
a
number
of
ships
laden
with
the
taxed
herb
arrived
at
the
port
of
boston
the
tea
was
seized
by
a
band
of
men
disguised
as
indians
and
thrown
into
the
harbor
the
news
of
that
action
made
the
king
and
his
ministry
furious
parliament
sympathized
with
the
government
and
in
retaliation
passed
four
laws
of
such
severity
that
the
colonists
nicknamed
them
the
intolerable
acts
the
first
law
was
the
boston
port
act
which
closed
the
harbor
to
all
trade
the
second
was
the
regulating
act
which
virtually
annulled
the
charter
of
massachusetts
took
the
government
away
from
the
people
and
gave
it
to
the
king
the
third
was
the
administration
of
justice
act
which
ordered
that
americans
who
committed
murder
in
resistance
to
oppression
should
be
sent
to
england
for
trial
the
fourth
was
the
quebec
act
which
declared
the
country
north
of
the
ohio
and
east
of
the
mississippi
a
part
of
canada
the
object
of
this
last
act
was
to
conciliate
the
french
canadians
and
secure
their
help
against
the
colonists
in
case
of
rebellion
embracing
territory
now
divided
into
the
five
states
of
ohio
indiana
illinois
michigan
and
wisconsin
with
eastern
minnesota
even
after
parliament
had
enacted
these
four
drastic
measures
a
compromise
might
have
been
effected
and
peace
maintained
if
the
counsels
of
the
best
men
had
been
followed
but
george
iii
would
listen
to
no
policy
short
of
coercion
he
meant
well
but
his
brain
was
not
well
balanced
he
was
subject
to
attacks
of
mental
derangement
and
his
one
idea
of
being
king
at
all
hazards
had
become
a
kind
of
monomania
pitt
condemned
such
oppression
as
morally
wrong
burke
denounced
it
as
inexpedient
and
fox
another
prominent
member
of
parliament
wrote
it
is
intolerable
to
think
that
it
should
be
in
the
power
of
one
blockhead
to
do
so
much
mischief
for
the
time
at
least
the
king
was
as
unreasonable
as
any
of
the
stuarts
the
obstinacy
of
charles
i
cost
him
his
head
that
of
james
ii
his
kingdom
that
of
george
iii
resulted
in
a
war
which
saddled
the
english
taxpayer
with
an
additional
debt
of
pounds
and
forever
detached
from
great
britain
the
fairest
and
richest
dominions
that
she
ever
possessed
the
american
revolution
independence
declared
in
war
began
and
the
stand
made
by
the
patriots
at
lexington
and
the
fighting
which
followed
at
concord
and
bunker
hill
showed
that
the
americans
were
in
earnest
the
cry
of
the
colonists
had
been
no
taxation
without
representation
now
they
had
got
beyond
that
and
demanded
no
legislation
without
representation
but
events
moved
so
fast
that
even
this
did
not
long
suffice
and
on
july
the
colonies
in
congress
assembled
solemnly
declared
themselves
free
and
independent
as
far
back
as
the
french
war
there
was
at
least
one
man
who
foresaw
this
declaration
after
the
english
had
taken
quebec
an
eminent
french
statesman
said
of
the
american
colonies
with
respect
to
great
britain
they
stand
no
longer
in
need
of
her
protection
she
will
call
on
them
to
contribute
toward
supporting
the
burdens
they
have
helped
to
bring
on
her
and
they
will
answer
by
striking
off
all
dependence
this
was
vergennes
see
bancroft
history
of
the
united
states
this
prophecy
was
now
fulfilled
after
the
americans
had
defeated
burgoyne
in
the
english
ministry
became
alarmed
they
declared
themselves
ready
to
make
terms
they
offered
to
grant
everything
but
independence
but
they
had
opened
their
eyes
to
the
facts
too
late
and
nothing
short
of
independence
would
now
satisfy
the
colonists
attempts
were
made
to
open
negotiations
with
general
washington
but
the
commander
in
chief
declined
to
receive
a
letter
from
the
english
government
addressed
to
him
not
in
his
official
capacity
but
as
george
washington
and
so
the
matter
came
to
nothing
this
was
after
france
had
recognized
the
independence
of
the
united
states
the
battle
of
yorktown
the
king
acknowledges
american
independence
the
war
against
the
rebellious
states
was
never
really
popular
in
england
from
the
outset
great
numbers
refused
to
enlist
to
fight
the
americans
and
spoke
of
the
contest
as
the
king
war
to
show
that
the
bulk
of
the
english
people
did
not
encourage
it
the
struggle
went
on
with
varying
success
through
seven
heavy
years
until
with
the
aid
of
the
french
the
americans
defeated
lord
cornwallis
at
yorktown
in
by
that
battle
france
got
her
revenge
for
the
loss
of
quebec
in
and
america
finally
won
the
cause
for
which
she
had
spent
so
much
life
and
treasure
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
a
hundred
years
later
in
the
autumn
of
a
number
of
english
gentlemen
were
present
at
the
centennial
celebration
of
the
taking
of
yorktown
to
express
their
hearty
good
will
toward
the
nation
which
their
ancestors
had
tried
in
vain
to
keep
a
part
of
great
britain
george
iii
could
hold
out
no
longer
on
a
foggy
december
morning
in
he
entered
the
house
of
lords
and
with
a
faltering
voice
read
a
paper
in
which
he
acknowledged
the
independence
of
the
united
states
of
america
he
closed
his
reading
with
the
prayer
that
neither
great
britain
nor
america
might
suffer
from
the
separation
and
he
expressed
the
hope
that
religion
language
interest
and
affection
might
prove
an
effectual
bond
of
union
between
the
two
countries
eventually
the
separation
proved
a
mutual
advantage
since
it
removed
to
a
great
extent
the
arbitrary
restrictions
on
trade
gave
a
new
impetus
to
commerce
and
immensely
increased
the
wealth

both
nations

with

acts
were

to
have

fury

it

jocosely

there
were

impeached
for

and
cruel
government
in

in
westminster

ruling

many
times
larger
than
the
whole
of

against

were

eloquent
men

impeach

of
all
the
trial
was
continued
at
intervals
for
over
seven
years
it
resulted
in
the
acquittal
of
the
accused
but
it
was
proved
that
the
chief
business
of
those
who
went
out
to
india
was
to
wring
fortunes
from
the
natives
and
then
go
back
to
england
to
live
like
nabobs
and
spend
their
money
in
a
life
of
luxury
this
fact
and
the
stupendous
corruption
that
was
shown
to
exist

though

were
nominally
free

public
affairs
yet
the
government
had
no
intention
of
permitting
any
severe
criticism
on
the
other
hand
there
were
men
who
were
determined
to
speak
their
minds
through
the

on
political
as
on
all
other
matters
in
the
early
part
of
the
reign
john
wilkes
an
able
but
scurrilous
writer
attacked
the
policy
of
the
crown
in
violent
terms
some
years
later
a
writer
who
signed
himself
junius
began
a
series
of
letters
in
a
daily
paper
in
which
he
handled
the
king
and
the
friends
still
more
roughly
an
attempt
was
made
by
the
government
to
punish
wilkes
and
the
publisher
of
the
junius
letters
but
it
signally
failed
in
both
cases
public
feeling
was
plainly
in
favor
of
the
freest
political
expression
which
was
eventually
conceded
later
during
the
excitement
caused
by
the
french
revolution
there
was
a
reaction
from
this
feeling
but
it
was
only
temporary
up
to
this
time
parliamentary
debates
had
rarely
been
reported
in
fact
under
the
tudors
and
the
stuarts
members
of
parliament
would
have
run
the
risk
of
imprisonment
if
their
criticisms
of
royalty
had
been
made
public
but
now
in
the
papers
began
to
contain
the
speeches
and
votes
of
both
houses
on
important
questions
every
effort
was
made
to
suppress
these
reports
but
again
the
press
gained
the
day
henceforth
the
nation
could
learn
how
far
its
representatives
really
represented
the
will
of
the
people
and
so
could
hold
them
strictly
accountable

matter
of
vital
importance

still
stood
in

and
if
the
unfortunate
offender
who
was
put
in
it
escaped
with
a
shower
of
mud
and
other
unsavory
missiles
instead
of

was
lucky

of

to
visit

to
see
the
wretched
inmates

the
whole
code
of

law
was
savagely
vindictive
capital
punishment
was
inflicted
for
about
two
hundred
offenses
many
of
which
would
now
be
thought
to
be
sufficiently
punished
by

two

the
pillory
was
not
abolished
until
the
accession
of
queen
victoria
not
only
men
but
women
and
children
even
were
hanged
for
pilfering
goods
or
food
worth
a
few
shillings
the
jails
were
crowded
with
poor
wretches
whom
want
had
driven
to
theft
and
who
were
worked
off
on
the
gallows
every
monday
morning
in
batches
of
a
dozen
or
twenty

of
the
jeering
drunken
crowds

five
shillings
or
was
the
hanging
limit
anything
stolen
above
that
sum
in
money

goods
might
send
the
thief
to
the
gallows
through
the
efforts
of
sir
samuel
romilly
jeremy
bentham
and
others
a
reform
was
effected
in
this
bloody
code
next
the
labors
of
the
philanthropic
john
howard
and
later
of
elizabeth
fry
purified
the
jails
of
abuses
which
had
made
them
not
only
dens
of
suffering
and
disease
but
schools
of
crime
as
well
the
laws
respecting
the
pubishment
for
debt
were
also
changed
for
the
better
and
thousands
of
miserable
beings
who
were
without
means
to
satisfy
their
creditors
were
set
free
instead
of
being
kept
in
useless
lifelong
imprisonment

england
became
alarmed

horrible
scenes

at
the
establishment

soil
could
not
become
a
citizen
of
another
nation
but
that
once
an
englishman
always
an
englishman
was
the
only
true
doctrine
in
accordance
with
that
theory
it
claimed
the
right
to
search
american
ships
and
take
from
them
and
force
into
their
own
service
any
seaman
supposed
to
be
of
british
birth
in
this
way
great
britian
had
seized
more
than
six
thousand
men
and
notwithstanding
their
protest
that
they
were
american
citizens
either
by
birth
or
by
naturalization
had
compelled
them
to
enter
the
english
navy
other
points
in
dispute
between
the
two
countries
were
in
a
fair
way
of
being
settled
amicably
but
there
appeared
to
be
no
method
of
coming
to
terms
in
regard
to
the
question
of
search
and
impressment
which
was
the
most
important
of
all
since
though
the
demand
of
the
united
states
was
in
the
popular
phrase
of
the
day
for
free
trade
and
sailors
rights
it
was
the
last
which
was
especially
emphasized
in
war
against
great
britain
was
declared
and
an
attack
made
on
canada
which
resulted
in
the
american
forces
being
driven
back
during
the
war
british
troops
landed
in
maryland
burned
the
capitol
and
other
public
buildings
in
washington
and
destroyed
the
congressional
library
on
the
other
hand
the
american
navy
had
unexpected
and
extraordinary
successes
on
the
ocean
and
the
lakes
out
of
fifteen
sea
combats
with
approximately
equal
forces
the
americans
gained
twelve
the
contest
closed
with
the
signal
defeat
of
the
english
at
new
orleans
when
general
andrew
jackson
completely
routed
the
forces
led
by
sir
edward
pakenham
of
the
duke
of

the
right

was
thenceforth
dropped

was
not

abandoned
by

than
forty
years
later
battle
of
waterloo
in
the
summer
of
the
english
war
against
napoleon
which
had
been
carried
on
almost
constantly
since
his
accession
to
power
culminated
in
the
decisive
battle
of
waterloo
napoleon
had
crossed
the
belgian
frontier
in
order
that
he
might
come
up
with
the
british
before
they
could
form
a
junction
with
their
prussian
allies
all
the
previous
night
rain
had
fallen
in
torrents
and
when
the
soldiers
rose
from
their
cheerless
and
broken
sleep
in
the
trampled
and
muddy
fields
of

a
drizzling
rain
was
still
falling

near
brussels
belgium
napoleon
planned
the
battle
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
first
the
english
and
then
the
prussian
forces
but
wellington
held
his
own
against
the
furious
attacks
of
the
french
it
was
evident
however
that
even
the
iron
duke
as
he
was
called
could
not
continue
to
withstand
the
terrible
assaults
many
hours
longer
as
time
passed
on
and
he
saw
his
solid
squares
melting
away
under
the
murderous
french
fire
as
line
after
line
of
his
soldiers
coming
forward
silently
stepped
into
the
places
of
their
fallen
comrades
while
the
expected
prussian
reenforcements
still
delayed
their
appearance
the
english
commander
exclaimed
o
that
night
or
blucher
would
come
at
last
blucher
with
his
prussians
did
come
and
as
grouchy
the
leader
of
a
division
on
which
napoleon
was
counting
did
not
waterloo
was
finally
won
by
the
combined
strength
of
the
allies
not
long
afterwards
napoleon
was
sent
to
die

prisoner
on
the
desolate
rock

him

field

with
the
dead
and
dying
a
great
victory
is
the
saddest
thing
on
earth
except
a
great
defeat
with
that
victory
ended
the
second
hundred
years
war
of
england
with
france
which
began
with
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
under
marlborough
at
the
outset
the
object
of
that
war
was
first
to
humble
the
power
of
louis
xiv
that
threatened
the
independence
of
england
and
secondly
to
protect
those
american
colonies
which
later

which
in
was
much
less
than
a

of

had
now
reached
the
enormous
amount
of
over
nine
hundred
millions
or
bearing
yearly
interest
at
the
rate
of
more
than
so
great
had
been
the
strain
on
the
finances
of
the
country
that
the

of
england
suspended
payment
and
many
heavy
failures
occurred
in
addition
to
this
a
succession
of
bad

sent
up
the

hardly

to
have
had

the
iron
hand
of
english
despotism
had
crushed
the
spirit
out
of
the
inhabitants
and
they
suffered
in
silence
during
the
first
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
destitution
of
the
people
was
so
great
that
dean
swift
in
bitter
mockery
of
the
government
neglect
published
what
he
called
his
modest
proposal
he
suggested
that
the
misery
of

peasants
might
be
relieved
by
allowing
them
to
eat
their
own
children
or
else
sell
them
to
the
butchers
but
a
new
attempt
was
now
made
to
improve
the
political
condition
of
the
wretched
country
that
distinguished
statesman
edmund
burke
had
already
tried
to
secure
a
fair
measure
of
commercial
liberty
for
the
island
but
without
success
since
the
reign
of
henry
vii
the
free
parliament
of
ireland
had
been
bound
hand
and
foot
by
poynings
act
note
the
eminent
protestant
irish
orator
henry
grattan
now
urged
the
repeal
of
that
law
with
all
his
impassioned
eloquence
he
was
seconded
in
his
efforts
by
the
powerful
influence
of
fox
in
the
english
house
of
commons
finally
the
obnoxious
act
was
repealed
and
a
independent
irish
parliament
to
which
grattan
was
elected
met
in
dublin
but
although
more
than
three
quarters
of
the
irish
people
were
catholics
no
person
of
that
faith
was
permitted
to
sit
in
the
new
parliament
or
to
vote
for
the
election
of
a
member
this
was
not
the
only
injustice
for
many
protestants
in
belfast
and
the
north
of
ireland
had
no
right
to
be
represented
in
it
such
a
state
of
things
could
not
fail
to
excite
angry
protest
and
grattan
with
other
protestants
in
parliament
labored
for
reform
the
discontent
finally
led
to
the
organization
of
an
association
called
the
society
of
united
irishmen
the
leaders
of
that
movement
hoped
to
secure
the
cooperation
of
catholics
and
protestants
and
to
obtain
fair
and
full
representation
for
both
in
the
irish
parliament
a
measure
of
political
reform
was
secured
but
it
did
not
go
far
enough
to
give
the
relief
desired
eventually
the
society
of
united
irishmen
became
a
revolutionary
organization
which
sought
by
the
help
of
the
french
to
make
ireland
an
independent
republic
the
sprigs
of
shamrock
or
badges
displayed
by
these
men
gave
a
new
significance
to
the
wearing
of
the
green
by
this
time
many
protestants
had
withdrawn
from
the
organization
and
many
catholics
refused
to
ask
help
from
the
french
revolutionary
party
who
were
hostile
to
all
churches
and
to
all
religion
see
a
quotation
from
the
famous
irish
song
the
wearin
o
the
green
in
the
shan
van
vocht
in
the
heroic
ballads
published
by
ginn
and
company
then
a
devoted
band
of
catholics
in
the
south
of
ireland
resolved
to
rise
and
trusting
to
their
own
right
arms
to
strike
for
independence
a
frightful
rebellion
broke
out
marked
by
all
the
intense
hatred
springing
from
rival
races
and
rival
creeds
and
aggravated
by
the
peasants
hatred
of
oppressive
landlords
both
sides
perpetuated
horrible
atrocities
the
government
employed
a
large
force
of
orangemen
or
extreme
protestants
to
help
suppress
the
insurrection
they
did
their
work
with
remorseless

emmet
matters
now
came
to
a
crisis
william
pitt
son
of
the
late
earl
of
chatham
was
prime
minister
he
believed
that
the
best
interests
of
both
ireland
and
england
demanded
their
political
union
he
devoted
all
his
energies
to
accomplishing
the
work
the
result
was
that
in
the
last
year
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
english
government
succeeded
by
the
most
unscrupulous
use
of
money
in
gaining
the
desired
end
lord
cornwallis
acting
as
pitt
agent
confessed
with
shame
that
he
bought
up
a
sufficient
number
of
members
of
the
irish
parliament
to
secure
a
vote
in
favor
of
union
with
great
britain
in
the
two
countries
were
joined
in
name
at
least
under
the
title
of
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
ireland
the
first
parliament
of
the
united
kingdom
met
in
pitt
used
all
his
powerful
influence
to
obtain
for
ireland
a
full
and
fair
representation
in
the
united
parliament
he
urged
that
catholics
as
well
as
protestants
should
be
eligible
for
election
to
that
body
but
the
king
positively
refused
to
listen
to
his
prime
minister
he
even
declared
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
his
coronation
oath
for
him
to
grant
such
a
request
the
consequence
was
that
not
a
single
catholic
was
admitted
to
the
imperial
parliament
until
nearly
thirty
years
later
two
years
after
the
first
imperial
parliament
met
in
london
the
irish
patriot
robert
emmet
made
a
desperate
effort
to
free
his
country
to
his
mind
the
union
of
england
with
ireland
was
simply
the
union
of
the
shark
with
its
prey
he
staked
his
life
on
the
cause
of
independence
he
lost
and
paid
the
forfeit
on
the
scaffold
but
notwithstanding
emmet
hatred
of
the
union
it
resulted
advantageously
to
ireland
in
at
least
two
respects
first
more
permanent
peace
was
secured
to
that
distracted
and
country
secondly
the
irish
people
made
decided
gains
commercially
the
duties
on
their
farm
products
were
removed
at
least
in
large
degree
and
the
english
ports
hitherto
closed
against
them
were
thrown
open
the
duties
on
their
manufactured
goods
seem
to
have
been
taken
off
at
that
time
only
in
part
later
absolute
freedom
of
trade
was
secured

until
that

was
at
hand
and

driven
by

was
soon
to
remedy
the
evils
it
had

created
it
led

a

among
these

famous
for
his
genius
his

and
his

which
was
always
getting
him
into

but
still
more
famous
for
his

in
the

year
adam

issued
an

into
the

which
had
a
great
effect
on

respecting
commerce

during

also
sir

became
prominent
as
a

so
too
does
the
witty

of

to
be
much
read
by
those
who
loved
the

they
were
followed
by

advance
had
been
made
for

generations
in

the
great
mass
of
the
people
were
nearly
as
ignorant
as
they
were
in
the

part
of

hardly
a

over
forty

could
be

could
read
a

in

not
one
in

could
write

there
were
no

seldom
left
the

in

they
were
born
they
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
in

their
education
was
wholly
of
the
practical
kind
which
comes
from
work
and
things
not
from
books
and

yet
many
of
them
with
only
these

close
of

marks
the
beginning
of
the

it
was
indicated
in
many
ways
and
among
others
by
the
declining
use
of
sedan
chairs
which
had
been
the
fashion
for
upwards
of
a
century
and
by
the
change
in

were
leaving
off
the
picturesque
costumes
of
the
past
the
cocked
hats
elaborate
wigs
silk

ruffles
velvet

not
very
long
after
the
jubilee
which
celebrated
the
fiftieth
year
of
his
reign
once
in
a
lucid
interval
he
was
found
by
the
queen
singing
a
hymn
and
playing
an
accompaniment
on
the
harpsichord
he
then
knelt
and
prayed
aloud
for
her
for
his
family
and
for
the
nation
and
in
closing
for
himself
that
it
might
please
god
to
avert
his
heavy
calamity
or
grant
him
resignation
to
bear
it
then
he
burst
into
tears
and
his
reason
again
fled
in
consequence
of
the
incapacity
of
the
king

of

with

of

the

height

reforms
of

were
the

george
iv
eldest
son
of
the
late
king
came
to
the
throne
in
his
year
but
owing
to
his
father
insanity
he
had
virtually
been
king
for
nearly
ten
years
his
habits
of
life
had
made
him
a
selfish
dissolute
spendthrift
who
like
charles
ii
cared
only
for
pleasure
though
while
prince
of
wales
he
had
received
for
many
years
an
income
upwards
of
pounds
which
was
largely
increased
at
a
later
period
yet
he
was
always
hopelessly
in
debt
parliament
appropriated
over
pounds
to
relieve
him
from
his
most
pressing
creditors
but
his
wild
extravagance
soon
involved
him
in
difficulties
again
so
that
had
it
not
been
for
help
given
by
the
taxpayers
his
royal
highness
must
have
become
as
bankrupt
in
purse
as
he
was
in
character
after
his
accession
matters
became
worse
rather
than
better
at
his
coronation
which
cost
the
nation
over
pounds
he
appeared
in
hired
jewels
which
he
forgot
to
return
and
which
parliament
had
to
pay
for
not
only
did
he
waste
the
nation
money
more
recklessly
than
ever
but
he
used
whatever
political
influence
he
had
to
opposesuch
measures
of
reform
as
the
times
demanded
discontent
the
manchester
massacre
when
george
then
prince
of
wales
became
regent
he
desired
to
form
a
whig
ministry
not
because
he
cared
for
whig
principles
but
solely
because
he
would
thereby
be
acting
in
opposition
to
his
father
wishes
finding
his
purpose
impracticable
he
accepted
tory
rule
and
a
cabinet
was
formed
with
lord
liverpool
as
prime
minister
it
had
for
its
main
object
the
continued
exclusion
of
catholics
from
representation
in
parliament
lord
liverpool
was
a
dull
man
who
utterly
failed
to
comprehend
the
real
tendency
of
the
age
he
was
the
son
of
a
commoner
who
had
been
raised
to
the
peerage
he
had
always
had
a
reputation
for
honest
obstinacy
and
for
little
else
after
he
became
premier
a
prominent
french
lady
who
was
visiting
england
asked
him
one
day
what
has
become
of
that
very
stupid
man

unfortunate

vol
ii
from
such
a
cabinet
or
government
which
continued
in
power
for
fifteen
years
nothing
but
trouble
could
be
expected
the
misery
of
the
country
was
great
food
was
selling
at
famine
prices
thousands
were
on
the
verge
of
starvation
and
tens
of
thousands
did
not
get
enough
to
eat
trade
was
seriously
depressed
and
multitudes
were
unable
to
obtain
work
under
these
circumstances
the
suffering
masses
undertook
to
hold
public
meetings
to
discuss
the
cause
and
cure
of
these
evils
but
as
violent
speeches
against
the
government
were
often
made
at
the
meetings
the
authorities
dispersed
them
on
the
ground
that
they
were
seditious
and
tended
to
riot
and
rebellion
many
large
towns
at
this
period
had
no
voice
in
legislation
at
birmingham
which
was
one
of
this
class
the
citizens
had
met
and
chosen
though
without
legal
authority
a
representative
to
parliament
machester
another
important
manufacturing
town
now
determined
to
do
the
same
thing
the
people
were
warned
not
to
assemble
but
they
persisted
in
doing
so
on
the
ground
that
peaceful
discussion
with
the
election
of
a
representative
was
no
violation
of
law
the
meeting
was
held
in
peter
fields
and
through
the
blundering
of
a
magistrate
it
ended
in
an
attack
by
a
body
of
troops
by
which
many
people
were
wounded
an
a
number
killed
the
six
acts
the
conspiracy
the
bitter
feeling
caused
by
the
manchester
massacre
or
peterloo
as
it
was
called
was
still
further
aggravated
by
the
passage
of
the
six
acts
the
object
of
these
severe
coercive
measures
was
to
make
it
impossible
for
men
to
take
any
public
action
demanding
political
reform
they
restricted
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
right
of
the
people
to
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
open
discussion
of
the
course
taken
by
the
government
these
harsh
laws
coupled
with
other
repressive
measures
taken
by
the
tories
who
were
still
in
power
led
to
the
cato
street
conspiracy
shortly
after
the
accession
of
george
iv
a
few
desperate
men
banded
together
and
meeting
in
a
stable
in
cato
street
london
formed
a
plot
to
murder
lord
liverpool
and
his
entire
cabinet
at
dinner
at
which
all
the
ministers
were
to
be
present
the
plot
was
discovered
and
the
conspirators
were
speedily
disposed
of
by
the
gallows
or
transportation
but
nothing
was
done
to
relieve
the
suffering
which
had
provoked
the
intended
crime
no
new
conspiracy
was
attempted
but
in
the
course
of
the
next
ten
years
a
silent
revolution
took
place
which
as
we
shall
see
later
obtained
for
the
people
that
fuller
representation
in
parliament
which
they
had
hitherto
vainly
attempted
to
get
queen
caroline
while
he
was
prince
of
wales
george
iv
had
contrary
to
law
privately
married
fitzherbert
a
roman
catholic
lady
of
excellent
character
and
possessed
of
great
beauty
ten
years
later
partly
through
royal
compulsion
and
partly
to
get
money
to
pay
off
some
of
his
numerous
debts
the
prince
married
his
cousin
the
princess
caroline
of
brunswick
the
union
proved
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
both
the
princess
lacked
both
discretion
and
delicacy
and
her
husband
who
disliked
her
from
the
first
was
reckless
and
brutal
toward
her
by
the
royal
marriage
act
of
no
descendant
of
george
ii
could
make
a
legal
marriage
without
the
consent
of
the
reigning
sovereign
unless
years
of
age
and
unless
the
marriage
was
not
objected
to
by
parliament
he
separated
from
her
in
a
year
time
and
as
soon
as
she
could
she
withdrew
to
the
continent
when
he
became
king
he
excluded
queen
caroline
name
from
the
prayer
book
and
next
applied
to
parliament
for
a
divorce
on
the
ground
of
the
queen
unfaithfulness
to
her
marriage
vows
henry
brougham
afterwards
lord
brougham
acted
as
the
counsel
no
sufficient
evidence
was
brought
against
her
and
the
ministry
declined
to
take
further
action
it
was
decided
however
that
she
could
not
claim
the
honor
of
coronation
to
which
as
queen
consort
she
had
a
right
sanctioned
by
custom
but
not
secured
by
law
when
the
king
was
crowned
no
place
was
provided
for
her
by
the
advice
of
her
counsel
she
presented
herself
at
the
entrance
of
westminster
abbey
as
the
coronation
ceremony
was
about
to
begin
but
by
order
of
her
husband
admission
was
refused
and
she
retired
to
die
heartbroken
a
few
days
after
three
great
reforms
seven
years
later
the
duke
of
wellington
a
tory
in
politics
became
prime
minister
his
sympathies
in
all
matters
of
legislation
were
with
the
king
but
he
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
for
the
time
acted
with
those
who
demanded
reform
the
corporation
act
which
was
originally
passed
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
and
had
for
its
object
the
exclusion
of
dissenters
from
all
town
or
corporate
offices
was
now
repealed
henceforth
a
man
might
become
a
mayor
alderman
or
town
officer
without
belonging
to
the
church
of
england
at
the
same
time
the
test
act
which
had
also
been
passed
in
charles
ii
reign
to
keep
both
catholics
and
dissenters
out
of
government
offices
whether
civil
or
military
was
repealed
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
teeth
of
both
acts
had
long
been
drawn
by
by
an
annual
indemnity
act
this
act
virtually
suspended
the
operation
of
the
corporation
act
and
the
test
act
against
dissenters
so
that
they
could
obtain
civil
offices
from
which
these
two
acts
had
excluded
them
in
a
still
greater
reform
was
carried
for
a
long
period
the
catholic
association
had
been
laboring
to
obtain
the
abolition
of
the
laws
which
had
been
on
the
statute
books
for
over
a
century
and
a
half
by
which
catholics
were
excluded
from
the
right
to
sit
in
parliament
these
laws
it
will
be
remembered
were
enacted
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
popish
plot
and
in
consequence
of
the
perjured
evidence
given
by
titus
oates
the
king
and
the
tory
party
marshaled
by
the
duke
of
wellington
strenuously
resisted
the
repeal
of
these
statutes
but
finally
the
duke
became
convinced
that
further
opposition
was
useless
he
therefore
suddenly
changed
about
and
solely
as
he
declared
to
avert
civil
war
took
the
lead
in
securing
the
success
of
a
measure
which
he
heartily
hated
see
sidney
smith
peter
plymley
letters
but
at
the
same
time
that
catholics
were
admitted
to
both
houses
of
parliament
an
act
was
passed
raising
the
property
qualification
of
a
very
large
class
of
small
irish
landholders
from
pounds
to
pounds
this
measure
deprived
many
thousands
of
their
right
to
vote
the
law
was
enacted
on
the
pretext
that
the
small
irish
landholders
would
be
influenced
by
their
landlord
or
their
priest
under
the
new
order
of
things
daniel
an
irish
gentleman
of
an
old
and
honorable
family
and
a
man
of
distinguished
ability
came
forward
as
leader
of
the
catholics
after
much
difficulty
he
succeeded
in
taking
his
seat
in
the
house
of
commons
he
henceforth
devoted
himself
though
without
avail
to
the
repeal
of
the
act
uniting
ireland
with
england
and
to
the
restoration
of
an
independent
irish
parliament
the
new
police
although
london
had
now
a
population
of
a
million
and
a
half
it
still
had
no
effective
police
the
guardians
of
the
peace
at
that
date
were
infirm
old
men
who
spent
their
time
dozing
in
sentry
boxes
and
had
neither
the
strength
nor
energy
to
be
of
service
in
any
emergency
the
young
fellows
of
fashion
considered
these
venerable
constables
as
legitimate
game
they
often
amused
themselves
by
upsetting
the
sentry
boxes
with
their
occupants
leaving
the
latter
helpless
in
the
street
kicking
and
struggling
like
turtles
turned
on
their
backs
and
as
powerless
to
get
on
their
feet
again
during
the
last
year
of
the
reign
sir
robert
peel
got
a
bill
passed
which
oganized
a
new
and
thoroughly
efficient
police
force
properly
equipped
and
uniformed
great
was
the
outcry
against
this
innovation
and
the
men
in
blue
were
hooted
at
not
only
by
london
roughs
but
by
respectable
citizens
as
bobbies
or
peelers
in
derisive
allusion
to
their
founder
but
the
bobbies
who
carry
no
visible
club
were
not
to
be
jeered
out
of
existence
they
did
their
duty
like
men
and
have
continued
to
do
it
in
a
way
which
long
since
gained
for
them
the
good
will
of
all
who
care
for
the
preservation
of
law
and
order
death
of
the
king
george
iv
died
soon
after
the
passage
of
the
new
police
bill
of
him
it
may
well
be
said
though
in
a
very
different
sense
from
that
in
which
the
expression
was
originally
used
that
nothing
in
his
life
became
him
like
the
leaving
of
it
during
his
ten
years
reign
he
had
squandered
enormous
sums
of
money
in
gambling
and
dissipation
and
had
done
his
utmost
to
block
the
wheels
of
political
progress
how
far
this
son
of
an
insane
father
was
responsible
it
may
not
be
for
us
to
judge
walter
scott
who
had
a
kind
word
for
almost
every
one
and
especially
for
any
one
of
the
tory
party
did
not
fail
to
say
something
in
praise
of
the
generous
good
nature
of
his
friend
george
iv
the
sad
thing
is
that
his
voice
seems
to
have
been
the
only
one
in
a
whole
nation
the
rest
were
silent
or
if
they
spoke
it
was
neither
to
commend
nor
to
defend
but
to
condemn
summary
the
legislative
reforms
of
george
iv
reign
are
its
chief
features
the
repeal
of
the
test
and
corporation
acts
and
the
grant
to
catholics
of
the
right
to
reenter
parliament
were
tardy
measures
of
justice
neither
the
king
nor
his
ministers
deserve
any
credit
for
them
but
none
the
less
they
accomplished
great
and
permanent
good
william
iv
accession
and
character
of
william
iv
as
george
iv
left
no
heir
his
brother
william
a
man
of
now
came
to
the
throne
he
had
passed
most
of
his
life
on
shipboard
having
been
placed
in
the
navy
when
a
mere
lad
he
was
somewhat
rough
in
his
manner
and
cared
nothing
for
the
ceremony
and
etiquette
that
were
so
dear
to
both
george
iii
and
george
iv
his
faults
however
were
on
the
surface
he
was
frank
hearty
and
a
friend
to
the
people
to
whom
he
was
familiarly
known
as
the
sailor
king
need
of
reform
in
parliamentary
representation
from
the
beginning
of
this
reign
it
was
evident
that
the
great
question
which
must
soon
come
up
for
settlement
was
that
of
parliamentary
representation
large
numbers
of
the
people
of
england
had
now
no
voice
in
the
government
this
unfortunate
state
of
things
was
chiefly
the
result
of
the
great
changes
which
had
taken
place
in
the
growth
of
the
population
of
the
midlands
or
the
central
portion
of
england
and
the
north
since
the
introduction
of
steam
the
rapid
increase
of
manufactures
and
commerce
had
built
up
birmingham
leeds
sheffield
manchester
and
other
large
towns
in
the
iron
coal
pottery
and
manufacturing
districts
see
industrial
map
of
england
these
important
towns
could
not
send
a
member
to
parliament
while
on
the
other
hand
many
places
in
the
south
of
england
which
did
send
members
had
long
ceased
to
be
of
any
importance
furthermore
the
representation
was
of
the
most
haphazard
description
in
one
section
no
one
could
vote
except
substantial
property
holders
in
another
none
but
town
officers
while
in
a
third
every
man
who
had
a
tenement
big
enough
to
boil
a
pot
in
and
hence
called
a
possessed
the
right
to
this
singular
state
of
things
the
nation
had
long
been
indifferent
during
the
middle
ages
the
inhavitants
often
had
no
desire
either
to
go
to
parliament
themselves
or
to
send
others
the
expense
of
the
journey
was
great
the
compensation
was
small
and
unless
some
important
matter
of
special
interest
to
the
people
was
at
stake
they
preferred
to
stay
at
home
on
this
account
it
was
often
almost
as
difficult
for
the
sheriff
to
get
a
distant
county
member
up
to
the
house
of
commons
in
london
as
it
would
have
been
to
carry
him
there
a
prisoner
to
be
tried
for
his
life
now
however
everything
was
changed
the
rise
of
political
parties
the
constant
and
heavy
taxation
the
jealousy
of
the
increase
of
royal
authority
the
influence
and
honor
of
the
position
of
a
parliamentary
representative
all
conspired
to
make
men
eager
to
obtain
their
full
share
in
the
management
of
the
government
this
new
interest
had
begun
as
far
back
as
the
civil
wars
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
when
cromwell
came
to
power
he
effected
many
reforms
but
after
the
restoration
of
the
stuarts
the
protector
wise
measures
were
repealed
or
neglected
then
the
old
order
or
rather
disorder
again
asserted
itself
and
in
many
cases
matters
became
worse
than
ever
rotten
boroughs
for
instance
the
borough
or
city
of
old
sarum
in
wiltshire
which
had
once
been
an
important
place
had
at
an
early
period
gradually
declined
through
the
growth
of
new
sarum
or
salisbury
near
by
see
map
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
parent
city
had
so
completely
decayed
that
not
a
single
habitation
was
left
on
the
desolate
hilltop
where
the
caste
and
cathedral
once
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
an
old
tree
the
owner
of
that
tree
and
of
the
field
where
it
grew
sent
two
members
to
parliament
that
action
represented
what
had
been
regularly
going
on
for
something
like
three
hundred
years
in
bath
on
the
other
hand
none
of
the
citizens
out
of
a
large
population
might
vote
except
the
mayor
alderman
and
common
council
these
places
now
got
the
significant
name
of
rotten
boroughs
from
the
fact
that
whether
large
or
small
there
was
no
longer
any
sound
political
life
existing
in
them
many
towns
were
so
completely
in
the
hands
of
the
squire
or
some
other
local
political
boss
that
on
one
occasion
when
a
successful
candidate
for
parliament
thanked
the
voters
for
what
they
had
done
a
man
replied
that
he
need
not
take
the
trouble
to
thank
them
for
said
he
if
the
squire
had
zent
his
great
dog
we
should
have
chosen
him
all
one
as
if
it
were
you
zur
see
hindon
in
murray
wiltshire
the
great
reform
bill
for
fifty
years
after
the
coming
in
of
the
georges
the
country
had
been
ruled
by
a
powerful
whig
monopoly
under
george
iii
that
monopoly
was
broken
and
the
tories
got
possession
of
the
government
but
whichever
party
ruled
parliament
owing
to
the
system
no
longer
represented
the
nation
but
simply
stood
for
the
will
of
certain
wealthy
landholders
and
town
corporations
a
loud
and
determined
demand
was
now
made
for
reform
in
this
movement
no
one
was
more
active
or
influential
among
the
common
people
than
william
cobbett
he
was
a
vigorous
and
fearless
writer
who
for
years
published
a
small
newspaper
called
the
political
register
which
was
especially
devoted
to
securing
a
just
and
uniform
system
of
representation
on
the
accession
of
william
iv
the
pressure
for
reform
became
so
great
that
parliament
was
forced
to
act
lord
john
russell
brought
in
a
bill
providing
for
the
abolition
of
the
rotten
boroughs
and
for
a
fair
system
of
elections
but
those
who
owned
or
controlled
those
boroughs
had
no
intention
of
giving
them
up
their
opponents
however
were
equally
determined
and
they
knew
that
they
had
the
support
of
the
nation
in
a
speech
which
the
reverend
sydney
smith
made
at
taunton
he
compared
the
futile
resistance
of
the
house
of
lords
to
the
proposed
reform
to
partington
attempt
to
drive
back
the
rising
tide
of
the
atlantic
with
her
mop
the
ocean
rose
and
partington
seizing
her
mop
rose
against
it
yet
notwithstanding
the
good
efforts
the
atlantic
got
the
best
of
it
so
the
speaker
prophesied
that
in
this
case
the
people
like
the
atlantic
would
in
the
end
carry
the
day
sydney
smith
essays
and
speeches
when
the
bill
came
up
the
greater
part
of
the
lords
and
the
bishops
who
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
personally
had
all
the
rights
and
privileges
they
wanted
opposed
it
so
too
did
the
tories
in
the
house
of
commons
they
thought
that
the
proposed
law
threatened
the
stability
of
the
government
the
duke
of
wellington
was
particularly
hostile
to
it
and
wrote
i
do
generally
take
a
gloomy
view
of
things
but
i
confess
that
knowing
all
that
i
do
i
can
not
see
what
is
to
save
the
church
or
property
or
colonies
or
union
with
ireland
or
eventually
monarchy
if
the
reform
bill
passes
wellington
dispatches
and
letters
ii
the
lords
reject
the
bill
serious
riots
the
king
dissolved
parliament
note
a
new
one
was
elected
and
the
reform
bill
was
passed
by
the
house
of
commons
but
the
upper
house
rejected
it
then
a
period
of
wild
excitement
ensued
the
people
in
many
of
the
towns
collected
in
the
public
squares
tolled
the
church
bells
built
bonfires
in
which
they
burned
the
bishops
in
effigy
with
other
leading
opponents
of
the
bill
and
cried
out
for
the
abolition
of
the
house
of
lords
in
london
the
rabble
smashed
the
windows
of
apsley
house
the
residence
of
the
duke
of
wellington
at
nottingham
the
mob
fired
and
destroyed
the
castle
of
the
duke
of
newcastle
because
he
was
opposed
to
reform
in
derby
a
serious
riot
broke
out
in
bristol
matters
were
still
worse
a
mob
got
possession
of
the
city
and
burned
the
bishop
palace
and
a
number
of
public
buildings
the
mayor
was
obliged
to
call
for
troops
to
restore
order
many
persons
were
killed
and
four
of
the
ringleaders
of
the
insurrection
were
hanged
all
over

shouts
were
heard

nothing
but

in
the
spring

the

had
set
his
heart
on
carrying
the
measure
in
this
crisis
he
appealed
to
the
king
for
help
if
the
tory
lords
would
not
pass
the
bill
the
king
had
the
power
to
create
a

to
exercise
this
power
thereupon
earl
grey
with
his
cabinet
resigned
but
in
a
week
the
king
had
to
recall
them
then
william
much
against
his
will
gave
the
following
document
to
his
prime
minister
the
king
grants
permission
to
earl
grey
and
to
his
chancellor
lord
brougham
to
create
such
a

william

king
this
is
the
customary
royal
signature
earl
grey
was
the
leader
of
that
branch
of
the
whig
party
known
as
the
aristocratic
whigs
yet
to
him
and
his
associate
cabinet
minsiters
the
people
were
indebted
for
the
great
extension
of
the
suffrage
in
but
there
was
no
occasion
to
make
use
of
this
permission
as
soon
as
the
lords
found
that
the
cabinet
with
earl
grey
at
the
head
had
actually
compelled
the
king
to
bow
to
the
demands
of
the
people
they
withdrew
their
opposition
the
great
charter
of
was
carried
received
the
royal
signature
and
became
law
the
passage
of
this
memorable
act
brought
about
these
beneficent
changes
it
abolished
nearly
sixty
rotten
boroughs
it
gave
every
householder
who
paid
a
rent
of
ten
pounds
in
any
town
a
vote
and
largely
extended
the
list
of
county
voters
as
well
it
granted
two
representatives
to
birmingham
leeds
manchester
and
nineteen
other
large
towns
and
one
representative
each
to
other
places
all
of
which
had
hitherto
been
unrepresented
besides
granting
fifteen
additional
members
to
the
counties
it
added
in
all
half
a
million
voters
to
the
list
mostly
men
of
the
middle

them

appendix
before
the
passing
of

reform
bill
and
the
legislation
which
supplemented
it
the
election
of
a
member
of
parliament
was
a
kind
of
local
reign
of
terror
the
smaller
towns
were
sometimes
under
the
control
of
drunken
ruffians
for
several
weeks
during
that
time
they
paraded
the
streets
in
bands
assaulting
voters
of
the
opposite
party
with
clubs
kidnaping
prominent
men
and
confining
them
until
after
the
election
and
perpetrating
other
outrages
which
so
frightened
peacable
citizens
that
often
they
did
not
dare
attempt
to
vote
at
all
finally
the
passage
of
the
reform
bill
of
effected
in
its
own
way
a
change
which
was
perhaps
as
momentous
as
that
which
the
revolution
of
had
accomplished
that
as
we
have
seen
made
the
king
dependent
for
his
crown
on
his
election
to
office
by
parliament
on
the
other
hand
the
reform
bill
practically
took
the
last
vestige
of
real
political
authority
from
the
king
and
transferred
it
to
the
cabinet
who
had
now
become
responsible
to
the
house
of
commons
and
hence
to
the
direct
will
of
the
majority
of
the
nation
but
though
the
sovereign
had
laid
down
his
political
scepter
never
to
resume
it
he
would
yet
by
virtue
of
his
exalted
position
continue
to
wield
great
power
that
of
social
and
diplomatic
influence
which
is
capable
of
accomplishing
most
important
results
both
at
home
and
abroad
then
though
the
king
still
reigns

people
and
the
people
alone

supplant
those

for
it
was
felt
that
a
new
political
era
needed
new
party
names
again
the
passage
of
the

bill
changed
the
policy
of
both
these
great
political
parties
it
made
liberals
and
conservatives
bid
against

for
the
support
of

large

it

entering

way
for

colonies
numbering
about
eight
hundred

set

appropriated
to
compensate
the
owners
it
was
a
grand
deed

done
could
america
have
followed
that
noble
example
she
might
thereby
have
saved
a
million
of

influence

five
years
of
waste
and

would
have
been
avoided

were
not
the
only

days

were

condemned
by
their
necessities
to
work

to

strength
in

cotton
mills
they
were
driven

brutal
masters

little
for

welfare
of

them

thirteen

was
so
rapid
that
in

years
from

time
london

were
connected
with
the
great
manufacturing
towns
while
local
steam
navigation
had
also
nearly
doubled
its

and
its

later

stephenson
might
easily
have
made
himself
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
or
at
least
of
the
avarice
of
that
day
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
lend
the
use
of
his
name

and
doubtful
railway
projects
but
he
refused
on
the
ground
that
he
did
not
care
to
make
money
without
labor
or
honor
meanwhile
the
whole
country
became
involved
in
a
speculative
craze
for
building
railways
scores
of
millions
of
pounds
were
invested
for
a
time

the

king
ruled
supreme
and
dukes

did
homage
to

schemes
promised
to
cover
the
whole

with
a
network
of

every
one
of

these

ended

of

found
that

could
destroy

even
faster

them
toward

close
of

a
humble
invention

had

method
continued
to
be

primitive
one
of
striking
a

of
flint

sharply
together

a

ignited
a

with

of

to
be
blown

suggested
the
use

the

was
invented
by

thus
gave
to

at

to

took

of
both
cerdic

the
fact
stands
out
in
stronger
relief
if
we
call
to
mind
what
england
had
passed
through
in
that
intervening
period
of
time
in
the
normans
crossed

conquered
its
inhabitants

which

the

of

succession
drove
one
line
of

from
the

and
called
in
another
from

to
take
its

meanwhile
the

had
gained
enormously
in

had
been
fully
and
finally
established
in
the

passed
by
which
the
power

extended

after

at
the
end
of
more
than
ten
centuries
from
the
date
when
egbert
first
became
overlord
of

we
have

too
that
william

tried
to
do
the
same
thing
but
had
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
beaten
william
unsuccessful
attempt
was
never
repeated
the
last
vestige
of
personal
government
that
is
of
the
determination
of

to
act
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
majority
of
the
nation
as
expressed
by
the
cabinet

with
the
late
king
see
the
reign
of
victoria
in
mccarthy
history
of
our
own
times
with
the
coronation
of
victoria
the
principle
was
established
once
for
all
that
henceforth
the
sovereign
of
the
british
empire
can
not
remove
the
prime
minister
or
his
cabinet
without
the
consent
of
the
house
of
commons
nor
on
the
other
hand
would
the
sovereign
now
venture
to
retain
a
ministry
which
the
commons
refused
to
support
this
limitation
of
the
prerogatives
of
royalty
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
house
of
commons
had
practically
become
the
ruling
power
in
england
and
since
that
house
is
freely
elected
by
the
great
body
of
the
people
in
order
that
it
may
declare
and
enforce
their
will
it
follows
that
the
government
of
the
realm
is
essentially
democratic
in
fact
so
far
as
reflecting
public
opinion
is
concerned
no
republic
in
the
world
is
more
democratic
in
order
to
guard
herself
against
any
political
influence
adverse
to
that
of
the
cabinet
and
hence
of
the
majority
of
the
house
of
commons
the
queen
was
compelled
to
consent
that
the
mistress
of
the
robes
or
head
of
her
majesty
household
should
change
at
the
demand
of
the
incoming
prime
minister
and
it
was
furthermore
agreed
that
any
ladies
under
her
whose
presence
might
be
politically
inconvenient
to
the
prime
minister
should
retire
of
their
own
accord
in
other
words
the
incoming
prime
minister
with
his
cabinet
has
the
right
to
remodel
the
sovereign
household
or
any
other
body
of
offices
in
whatever
degree
he
may
think
requisite
and
the
late
prince
albert
could
not
even
appoint
his
own
private
secretary
but
much
to
his
chagrin
had
to
accept
one

that
any

will
ever
attempt

do
what
she
did
in

an
able

authoritative

that
of

that
of
the

a
change
equally
great
was
taking
place
with
respect
to
the
peers
or
lords
as
that
body
has
played
a
most
important
part
in
the
government
of
england
and
still
retains
considerable
influence
it
may
be
well
to
consider
its
history

present

referring
to

here
limited
as
it
has
been
ever
since
to
the
higher
clergy
now
consisting
of
certain
bishops
and
to
the
hereditary
nobility
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
peerage
originated
with
the
norman
conquest
william
rewarded
the
barons
or
chief
men
who
fought
under
him
at
hastings
with
grants
of
immense
estates
which
were
given
on
two
conditions
one
of
military
service
at
the
call
of
the
sovereign
the
other
their
attendance
when
required
at
the
great
or
royal
council
an
advisory
and
legislative
body
which
contained
the
germ
of
what
later
came
to
be
called
parliament
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
the
conqueror
made
the
possession
of
landed
property
directly
dependent
on
the
discharge
of
public
duties
so
that
if
on
the
one
hand
the
conquest
carried
out
the
principle
that
they
should
take
who
have
the
power
and
they
should
keep
who
can
on
the
other
it
insisted
on
the
higher
principle
that
in
return
for
such
and
the
victors
should
bind
themselves
by
oath
to
help
defend
the
kingdom
and
to
help
govern
it

that

known

who
as
leaders
of

party
felt
obliged
to
carry
the
reform
bill
of
by
which
the
right
to
vote
was
greatly
extended
among
the
people
seven
hundred
years
ago
the
house
of
lords
was
the
only
legislative
and
executive
body
in
the
country
now
nearly
all
the
most
important
business
of
parliament
is
done
in
the
house
of
commons
consisting
of
some
six
hundred
and
seventy
members
and
the
lords
can
not
vote
a
penny
of
money
for
any
purpose
whatever
unless
commons
first
passes
a
bill
to
that
effect
thus
taxation
which
is
generally
regarded
as
the
most
important
of
all
measures
has
passedf
from
the
lords
to
the
direct
representatives
of
the
people
at
one
time
certain
impatient
radicals
in
the
house
of
commons
denounced
the
peers
as
titled
obstructionists
in
fact
late
in
the
nineteenth
century
a
resolution
to
put
an
end
to
their
obstructive
power
was
carried
in
the
commons
when
half
the
members
were
absent
by
a
majority
of
two
but
the
vote
was
not
taken
seriously
and
the
lords
were
not
called
upon
to
go
out
of
business
the
upper
house
has
continued
on
occasion
to
exercise
its
constitutional
righ
of
vetoing
bills
sent
up
to
it
by
the
house
of
commons
though
since
it
has
rejected
but
one
money
bill
and
that
only
temporarily
since
then
the
liberal
party
has
demanded
more
strenuously
than
ever
that
the
veto
power
of
the
lords
should
be
either
greatly
limited
or
abolished
altogether
as
far
back
as
the
house
of
commons
resolved
that
in
all
aids
given
to
the
king
by
the
commons
the
rate
or
tax
ought
not
to
be
altered
by
the
lords
in
they
emphatically
repeated
this
resolution
in
when
the
lords
rejected
a
money
bill
for
the
repeal
of
paper
duties
the
commons
vigorously
protested
declaring
that
they
regarded
the
exercise
of
that
power
by
the
upper
house
with
particular
jealousy
from
that
time
the
commons
were
careful
to
include
all
the
financial
measures
of
the
year
in
one
bill
which
the
lords
were
forced
to
accept
or
reject

the

was
about
her

age
of
fine
personal
appearance
and
had
just
graduated
from
one
of
the
german
universities
he
was

and
throughout
his
life
used
his
influence
to
raise
the
standard
of

sir
rowland
hill
postal
reforms
the
preceding
year
sir
rowland
hill
introduced
a
uniform
system
of
cheap
postage
the
rate
had
been
as
high
as
a
shilling
for
a
single
letter
such
a
charge
was
practically
prohibitive
and
as
a
rule
no
one
wrote
in
those
days
if
he
could
possibly
avoid
it
sir
rowland
reduced
it
to
a
penny
paid
by
stamp
to
any
part
of
the
united
kingdom
since
then
the
government
has
taken
over
all
the
telegraph
lines
and
cheap
telegrams
and
the
cheap
transportation
of
parcels
by
mail
a
kind
of
government
express
known
as

post
have
followed
they
are
all
improvements
of
immense
practical
benefit
an
illustration
of
the
effects
of
such
high
charges
for
postage
is
related
by
coleridge
he
says
that
he
met
a
poor
woman
at
keswick
just
as
she
was
returning
a
letter
from
her
son
to
the
postman
saying
she
could
not
afford
to
pay
for
it
coleridge
gave
the
postman
the
shilling
and
the
woman
told
the
poet
that
the
letter
was
really
nothing
more
than
a
blank
sheet
which
her
son
had
agreed
to
send
her
every
three
months
to
let
her
know
he
was
well
as
she
always
declined
to
take
this
dummy
letter
it
of
course
cost
her
nothing

the
feeling
attending
the
passage
of
the
reform
bill
of
had
passed
away
but
now
a
popular
agitation
began
which
produced
even
greater
excitement
although
the
act
of
had
equalized
parliamentary
representation
and
had
enlarged
the
elective
franchise
to
a
very
considerable
degree
yet
the
great
body
of
workingmen
were
still
shut
out
from
the
right
to
vote
a
radical
party
called
the
chartists
now
arose
which
undertook
to
secure
further
measures
of
reform
they
embodied
their
measures
in
a
document
called
the
charter
which
demanded
universal
male
suffrage
that
the
voting
at
elections
should
be
by
ballot
annual
parliaments
the
payment
of
memebers
of
parliament
the
abolition
of
the
property
qualification
for
parliamentary
candidates
the
division
of
the
whole
country
into
equal
electoral
districts
property
qualification
in
an
act
was
passed
requiring
candidates
for
election
to
the
house
of
commons
to
have
an
income
of
not
less
than
pounds
derived
from
landed
property
the
object
of
this
law
was
to
secure
members
who
would
be
comparatively
free
from
the
temptation
of
receiving
bribes
from
the
crown
and
also
to
keep
the
landed
proprietors
in
power
to
the
exclusion
of
rich
merchants
this
law
was
repealed
in
the
chartists
held
public
meetings
organized
clubs
and
published
newpapers
to
disseminate
their
principles
but
for
many
years
made
very
little
progress
the
french
revolution
which
dethroned
king
louis
philippe
imparted
fresh
impetus
to
the
chartist
movement
the
leader
of
that
movement
was
feargus
he
formed
the
plan
of
sending
a
monster
petition
to
parliament
containing
it
was
claimed
nearly
five
million
signatures
praying
for
the
passage
of
the
people
charter
a
procession
of
a
million
or
more
signers
was
to
act
as
an
escort
to
the
document
which
made
a
wagonload
in
itself
the
government
became
alarmed
at
the
threatened
demonstration
forbade
it
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
attempt
to
coerce
legislation
and
organized
a
body
of
special
policemen
to
preserve
order
the
duke
of
wellington
took
command
of
a
large
body
of
troops
held
in
reserve
to
defend
the
city
and
the
bank
of
england
the
houses
of
parliament
the
british
museum
and
other
public
buildings
were
made
ready
to
withstand
a
siege
it
was
now
the
chartists
turn
to
be
frightened
when
they
assembled
on
kennington
common
in
south
london
they
numbered
less
than
thirty
thousand
and
the
procession
of
a
million
which
was
to
march
across
westminster
bridge
to
the
houses
of
parliament
dwindled
to
half
a
dozen
when
the
huge
petition
was
unrolled
it
was
found
to
contain
only
about
a
third
of
the
boasted
number
of
names
further
examination
showed
that
many
of
the
signatures
were
spurious
having
been
put
down
in
jest
or
copied
from
gravestones
and
old
london
directories
with
that
discovery
the
whole
movement
collapsed
and
the
house
of
commons
rang
with
inextinguishable
laughter
over
the
national
scare
still
the
demands
of
the
chartists
had
a
solid
foundation
of
good
sense
which
the
blustering
bravado
of
the
leaders
of
the
movement
could
not
wholly
destroy
most
if
not
all
of
the
reforms
asked
for
were
needed
since
then
the
steady
quiet
influence
of
reason
and
of
time
has
compelled
parliament
to
grant
the
greater
part
of
them
sir
thomas
erskine
may
in
his
constitutional
history
of
england
says
not
a
measure
has
been
forced
upon
parliament
which
the
calm
judgment
of
a
later
time
has
not
since
approved
not
an
agitation
has
failed
which
posterity
has
not
condemned
the
printed
or
written
ballot
has
been
substituted
for
the
old
method
of
electing
candidates
by
a
show
of
hands
or
by
shouting
yes
or
no
a
method
by
which
it
was
easy
to
make
blunders
and
equally
easy
to
commit
frauds
every
voter
must
now
have
his
name
and
address
registered
in
a
printed
list
every
voter
too
casts
a
secret
ballot
and
so
safeguards
his
political
independence
the
property
qualification
has
been
abolished
note
so
that
the
day
laborer
may
now
run
for
parliament
he
is
sure
too
of
being
well
paid
for
parliament
voted
to
give
pounds
a
year
to
every
member
of
the
house
of
commons
the
right
of
manhood
suffrage
has
been
greatly
extended
and
before
the
twentieth
century
has
advanced
much
farther
every
man
in
england
will
probably
have
a
voice
in
the
elections
the
corn
laws
at
the
accession
of
the
queen
protective
duties
or
taxes
existed
in
great
britain
on
all
imported
breadstuffs
and
on
many
manufactured
articles
sir
robert
peel
the
conservative
prime
minister
favored
a
reduction
in
the
last
class
of
duties
but
believed
it
necessary
to
maintain
the
former
in
order
to
keep
up
the
price
of
grain
and
thus
encourage
the
english
farmers
the
result
of
this
policy
was
great
distress
among
the
poorly
paid
workingmen
who
could
not
afford
to
buy
dear
bread
a
number
of
philanthropists
led
by
richard
cobden
and
john
bright
organized
an
law
league
to
obtain
the
repeal
of
the
grain
duties
corn
is
the
name
given
in
england
to
wheat
or
other
grain
used
for
food
indian
corn
or
maize
can
not
be
grown
in
that
climate
and
is
seldom
eaten
there
at
the

time
ebenezer
elliott
the
rhymer
gave
voice
to
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
in
rude
but
vigorous
verse
which
appealed
to
the
excited
feelings
of
thousands
in
such
words
as
these
england
what
for
mine
and
me
what
hath
bread
tax
done
for
thee
cursed
thy
harvest
cursed
thy
land
thy
skill
right
hand
when
however
session
after
session
of
parliament
passed
and
nothing
was
done
for
the
relief
of
the
perishing
multitudes
many
began
to
despair
and
great
numbers
joined
in
singing
elliott
new
national
anthem
when
wilt
thou
save
the
people
o

when
not
kings
or

o

are
they
let
them
not
pass
like
weeds
away
their
heritage
a
sunless
day
god
save
the
people
still
the
government
was
not
covinced
the
corn
laws
were
enforced
the
price
of
bread
showed
no
signs
of
falling
and
the
situation
grew
daily
more
desperate
and
more
threatening
the
irish
famine
at
last
the
irish
famine
opened
the
prime
minister
eyes
when
in
elizabeth
reign
sir
walter
raleigh
brought
over
the
cheap
but
precarious
potato
from
america
and
planted
it
in
ireland
his
motive
was
one
of
pure
good
will
he
could
not
foresee
that
it
would
in
time
become
in
that
country
an
almost
universal
food
that
through
its
very
abundance
the
population
would
rapidly
increase
and
that
then
by
the
sudden
failure
of
the
crop
terrible
destitution
would
ensue
such
was
the
case
in
the
summer
of
it
is
said
by
eyewitnesses
that
in
a
single
night
the
entire
potato
crop
was
smitten
with
disease
and
the
healthy
plants
were
transformed
into
a
mass
of
putrefying
vegetation
thus
at
one
fell
stroke
the
food
of
nearly
a
whole
nation
was
cut
off
the
parnell
movement

worthy
of
mention
with
the
exception
of
that
with
china
at
that
time
the
chinese
emperor
either
from
a
desire
to
put
a
stop
to
the
consumption
of
opium
in
his
dominions
or
because
he
wished
to
encourage
the
home
production
of
the
drug
prohibited
its
importation
as
the

in

were
largely
engaged

market
the

the

ensued
the
chinese
being
unable
to
contend
against

were
soon
forced
to
withdraw

prohibition
of

foreign

traffic
the
english
government
with
the
planters
of

reaped
a
golden
reward
of
many
millions
for
their
deliberate
violation
of
the
rights
of
a
heathen
and
people
the
war
opened
five
important
ports
to
the
british
trade
and
subsequent
wars
opened
a
number
more
on
the
rivers
in
the
interior
this
action
with
the
later
aggressions
of
other
european
powers
roused
an
intensely
bitter
feeling
among
large
numbers
of
the
chinese
their
hatred
of
foreigners
finally
led
to
a
desperate
but
unsuccessful
attempt
to
drive
all
europeans
and
americans
including
missionaries
out
of
the
country
eventually
the
pressure
of
the
great
powers
of
europe
and
the
diplomatic
influence
of
the
united
states
induced
china
to
grant
the
open
door
to
the
demands
of
foreign
trade
later
england
and
china
made
an
agreement
which
bids
fair
to
stop
the
exportation
of
opium
to
that
country
next
turkey
declared
war
against
russia
the
latter
power
had
insisted
on
protecting
all
christians
in
the
turkish
dominions
against
the
oppression
of
the
sultan
england
and
france
considered
the
czar
championship
of
the
christians
as
a
mere
pretext
for
occupying
turkish
territory
to
prevent
this
aggression
they
formed
an
alliance
with
the
sultan
which
resulted
in
the
war
and
ended
in
the
taking
of
sebastopol
by
the
allied
forces
russia
was
obliged
to
retract
her
demands
and
peace
was
declared
the
great
rebellion
in
india
the
following
year
was
memorable
for
the
outbreak
of
rebellion
in
india
the
real
cause
of
the
revolt
was
probably
a
feeling
of
resentment
on
the
part
of
the
sepoy
or
native
troops
against
english
rule
a
feeling
that
dates
back
to
the
extortion
and
misgovernment
of
warren
hastings
the
immediate
cause
of
the
uprising
was
the
introduction
of
an
improved
rifle
using
a
greased
cartridge
which
had
to
be
bitten
off
before
being
rammed
down
to
the
hindu
the
fat
of
cattle
or
swine
is
an
abomination
and
his
religion
forbids
his
tasting
it
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
british
government
to
enforce
the
use
of
the
new
cartridge
brought
on
a
general
mutiny
among
three
hundred
thousand
sepoys
during
the
revolt
the
native
troops
perpetrated
the
most
horrible
atrocitise
on
the
english
women
and
children
who
fell
into
their
hands
when
the
insurrection
was
finally
quelled
under
havelock
and
campbell
the
english
soldiers
retaliated
by
binding
numbers
of
prisoners
to
the
mouths
of
cannon
and
blowing
them
to
shreds
at
the
close
of
the
rebellion

of

at

critical

in

used

influence
to
maintain

between
the
two
countries
after

death
the

held
no
court
for
many
years
and
so
complete
was
her
seclusion
that
sir
charles
dilke
a
radical
suggested
in
parliament
that
her
majesty
be
invited
to
abdicate
or
choose
a
regent
the
suggestion
was
indignantly
rejected
but
it
revealed
the
feeling
which
quite
generally
existed
that
the
real
queen
died
with
her
husband
and
that
only
her
shadow
remained
in

who
were
on
their
way
to
england
when
intelligence
of
the
act
was
conveyed
to

lincoln
he
expressed
his
unqualified
disapproval
of
it
saying
this
is
the
very
thing
the
british
captains
used
to
do
they
claimed
the
right
of
searching
american
ships
and
taking
men
out
of
them
that
was
the
cause
of

of
now
we
can
not

own
principles
we
shall
have
to
give
up
these
men
and
apologize
for
what
we
have
done
the
british
government
made
a
formal
demand
that
the
commissioners
should
be
given
up
through
the
influence
of
prince
albert
and
with
the
approval
of
the
queen
this
demand
was
couched
in
most
conciliatory
language
slidell
and
mason
were
handed
over
to
great
britain
and
an
apology
was
made
by
secretary
seward
during
the
progress
of
the
civil
war
a
number
of
vessels
were
fitted
out
in
england
and
employed
in
running
the
blockade
of
the
southern
ports
to
supply
them
with
arms
ammunition
and
manufactured
goods
of
various
kinds
later
several
gunboats
were
built
in
british
shipyards
by
agents
of
the
confederate
government
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
the
most
famous
of
these
vessels
was
the
alabama
built
expressly
for
the
confederate
service
by
the
lairds
of
birkenhead
armed
with
british
cannon
and
manned
chiefly
by
british
sailors
charles
francis
adams
the
american
minister
at

notified

palmerston
the
prime

of
her
true
character
but
palmerston
permitted

to
leave

satisfied
with
the
pretext
that
she
was
going
on
a
trial
trip
she
set
sail
on
her
career
of
destruction
and
soon
drove
nearly
every
american
merchant

from
the

two
years
later
she
was
defeated
and

kearsarge
after
the

the
government
of
the

demanded
damages
from
great
britain
for
losses
caused
by
the
alabama
and
other
privateers
the
queen
advocate
gave
his
opinion
that
the
alabama
should
be
detained
but
it
reached
the
foreign
secretary
lord
russell
just
after
she
had
put
out
to
sea
a
treaty
was
agreed
to
by
the
two
nations
and
by
its
provisions
an
international
court
was
held
at
geneva
switzerland
to
deal
with
the
demands
made
by
the
united
states
on
great
britain
the
court
awarded
in
gold
as
compensation
to
the
united
states
which
was
duly
paid
one
very
important
result
of
this
decision
was
that
it
established
a
precedent
for
settling
by
arbitration
on
equitable
and
amicable
terms
whatever
questions
might
arise
in
future
between
the
two
nations
this
treaty
imposed
duties
on
neutral
governments
of
a
far
more
stringent
sort
than
great
britain
had
hitherto
been
willing
to
concede
it
resulted
furthermore
in
the
passage
of
an
act

excellent
as
was
the
reform
bill
of
it
did
not
go
far
enough
there
was
also
great
need
of
municipal
reform
since
in
many
cities
the
taxpayers
had
no
voice
in
the
management
of
local
affairs
and
the
city
officers
sometimes
spent
the
income
of
large
charitable
funds
in
feasting
and
merrimaking
while
the
poor
got
little
or
nothing
a
law
was
passed
giving
taxpayers
in
cities
except
london
control
of
municipal
elections
by
a
subsequent
amendment
the
ballot
in
such
cases
was
extended
to
women
and
for
the
first
time
perhaps
in
modern
history
partial
woman
suffrage
was
formally
granted
by
supreme
legislative
act
a
number
of
years
later

restrictions
imposed

there
was
a
considerable
number
of
jews
in

in
other
large

who
were

they
were
entitled

required

still

in

for
whom
nothing
had
been

the

employed

joseph

a

hunger
and
toil
succeeded
in
establishing

in

the
liberal
prime
minister
secured
the
ballot
for
agricultural
laborers
by
the
passage
of
the
third
reform
act
which
gave
all
residents
of
counties
throughout
the
united
kingdom
the
right
to
vote
on
the
same
liberal
conditions
as
the
residents
of
the
towns
it
is
estimated
that
this
last
law
added
about
two
and
a
half
millions
of
voters
this
gave
one
voter
to
every
six
persons
of
the
total
population
whereas
before
the
passing
of
the
first
reform
bill
in
thre
was
not
over
one
in
fifty
when
the
new
or
people
parliament
convened
joseph
arch
and
several
other
candidates
took
their
seats
in
the
house
of

as
representatives
of
classes
of
the
population
who
up
to

had
no

the

and

acts
greatly
extended
the
power
of
the
people
in
all
matters
of
local

so
that
now
every
village
in

controls
its
own
affairs
compulsory
church
rates
abolished
disestablishment
in
ireland
while
these
great
reforms
were
taking
place
with
respect
to
elections
others
of
great
importance
were
also
being
effected
from
its
origin
in
the
established
protestant
church
of
england
had
compelled
persons
of
all
religious
beliefs
to
pay
rates
or
taxes
for
the
maintenance
of
the
established
cuhrch
in
the
parish
where
they
resided
methodists
baptists
and
other
dissenters
objected
to
this
law
as
unjust
since
in
addition
to
the
expense
of
supporting
their
own
form
of
worship
they
were
obliged
to
contribute
toward
maintaining
one
with
which
they
had
no
sympathy
so
great
had
the
opposition
become
to
paying
these
church
rates
that
in
over
fifteen
hundred
parishes
in
england
the
authorities
could
not
collect
them
after
long
debate
gladstone
carried
through
a
bill
which
abolished
this
mode
of
taxation
and
made
the
payment
of
these
rates
purely
voluntary
church
rates
were
levied
on
all
occupiers
of
land
or
houses
within
the
parish
the
church
of
england
is
now
supported
by
a
tax
on
landowners
by
its
endowments
and
by
voluntary
gifts
a
similar
act
of
justice
was
soon
after
granted
to
ireland
at
the
time
of
the
union
of
the
two
countries
in
the
maintenance
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
continued
to
remain
obligatory
upon
the
irish
people
although
only
a
small
part
of
them
were
of
that
faith
gladstone
now
liberal
prime
minister
succeeded
in
getting
parliament
to
enact
a
law
which
disestablished
this
branch
of
the
national
church
and
left
all
religious
denominations
in
ireland
to
the
voluntary
support
of
those
who
belonged
to
them
henceforth
the
english
protestants
residing
in
that
country
could
no
longer
claim
the
privilege
of
worshiping
god
at
the
expense
of
his
roman
catholic
neighbor
the
disestablishment
bill
was
passed
in
and
took
effect
in
the
elementary
education
act
in
forester
a
member
of
gladstone
liberal
cabinet
succeeded
in
passing
a
measure
of
the
highest
importance
entitled
the
elementary
education
act
this
act
did
not
undertake
to
establish
a
new
system
of
instruction
but
to
aid
and
improve
that
which
was
then
in
use
in
the
course
of
time
however
it
effected
such
changes
for
the
better
in
the
common
schools
that
it
practically
most
of
them
it
will
be
remembered
that
before
the
reformation
the
catholic
monasteries
took
the
leading
part
in
educating
the
children
of
the
country
the
destruction
of
the
monasteries
by
henry
viii
put
a
stop
to
their
work
but
after
henry
death
his
son
edward
vi
established
many
protestant
schools
while
tohers
were
founded
by
men
who
had
grown
suddenly
rich
through
getting
possession
of
monastic
lands
these
new
schools
did
good
work
and
are
still
doing
it
but
they
seldom
reached
the
children
of
the
poor
later
on
many
wealthy
persons
founded
charity
schools
to
help
the
class
who
could
not
afford
to
pay
anything
for
their
tuition
the
pupils
who
lived
in
these
institutions
of
which
a
number
still
exist
were
generally
obliged
to
wear
a
dress
which
by
its
peculiarity
of
cut
and
color
always
reminded
them
that
they
were
objects
of
public
or
private
benevolence
furthermore
while
the
boys
in
these
institutions
were
often
encouraged
to
go
on
and
enter
grammar
schools
the
girls
were
informed
that
a
very
little
learning
would
be
all
that
they
would
ever
need
in
the
humble
station
in
life
to
which
providence
had
seen
fit
to
call
them
meanwhile
the
church
of
england
and
other
religious
denominations
both
catholic
and
protestant
established
many
common
schools
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
the
cost
of
carrying
them
on
was
usually
met
by
private
contributions
all
of
these
schools
gave
some
form
of
denominational
religious
instruction
as
the
population
increased
many
more
schools
were
required
at
length
parliament
began
to
grant
money
to
help
the
different
religious
societies
in
maintaining
their
systems
of
instruction
when
able
the
parents
of
the
children
were
also
called
on
to
pay
a
small
sum
weekly
in
the
liberal
government
took
hold
of
the
education
question
with
great
vigor
it
provided
that
in
all
cases
where
the
existing
church
of
england
or
other
denominational
schools
were
not
able
to
accomodate
the
children
of
a
given
district
school
boards
should
be
established
to
open
new
schools
which
if
necessary
should
be
maintained
entirely
at
the
public
expense
in
these
board
schools
as
they
were
called
no
denominational
religious
instruction
whatever
could
be
given
this
very
important
act
placed
a
school
within
the
reach
of
every
child
but
except
in
very
poor
districts
these
schools
were
not
made
free
schools
in
fact
free
schools
in
the
american
sense
can
not
be
said
to
exist
in
great
britain
later
on
compulsory
attendance
was
required
and
subsequent
acts
of
parliament
transferred
the
management
of
these
schools
from
the
school
boards
to
the
town
and
county
councils
again
these
new
measures
make
it
practicable
for
a
boy
or
girl
who
has
done
well
in
the
primary
course
to
secure
assistance
which
will
open
opportunities
for
obtaining
a
higher
education
thus
as
a
recent
writer
declares
there
is
now
a
path
leading
from
the
workman
home
even
to
the
university
but
many
men
and
women
who
belong
to
the
dissenting
denominations
complain
that
the
educational
acts
of
compel
them
to
pay
taxes
for
the
support
of
a
great
number
of
public
elementary
schools
which
are
under
the
control
of
the
english
church
and
furthermore
that
teachers
who
are
members
of
dissenting
societies
such
as
the
presbyterians
methodists
baptists
can
seldom
if
ever
get
appointments
in
the
class
of
schools
mentioned
quite
a
number
of
these
dissenters
who
call
themselves
passive
resisters
have
refused
to
pay
the
school
tax
and
have
had
their
property
seized
or
have
been
sent
to
jail
year
after
year
lowell
the
government
of
england
ii
meanwhile
the
universities
and
colleges
with
most
of
the
offices
and
professorships
connected
with
them
were
thrown
open
to
all
persons
without
regard
to
religious
belief
whereas
formerly
no
one
could
graduate
from
oxford
or
cambridge
without
subscribing
to
the
doctrines
of
the
church
of
england
the
first
irish
land
act
in
the
same
year
that
the
government
undertook
to
provide
for
the
education
of
the
masses
gladstone
who
was
still
prime
minister
and
head
of
the
liberal
party
brought
in
a
bill
for
the
relief
of
small
irish
farmers
those
who
had
to
support
themselves
and
their
families
from
the
little
they
could
get
from
a
few
hired
acres
since
the
union
much
of
the
general
policy
of
england
toward
ireland
had
been
described
as
a
quick
alternation
of
kicks
and
kindness
gladstone
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
he
believed
the
misery
of
the
island
sprang
mainly
from
its
misgovernment
he
thought
that
the
small
farmer
needed
immediate
help
and
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
liberal
party
to
grant
it
the
circumstances
under
which
the
land
was
held
in
ireland
were
peculiar
a
very
large
part
of
it
was
owned
by
englishmen
whose
ancestors
obtained
it
through
the
wholesale
confiscations
of
james
i
cromwell
and
later
rulers
very
few
of
these
english
landlords
cared
to
reside
in
the
country
or
to
do
anything
for
its
improvement
their
agents
or
overseers
generally
forced
the
farm
tenants
to
pay
the
largest
amount
of
rent
that
could
be
wrung
from
them
and
they
could
dispossess
a
tenant
of
his
land
whenever
they
saw
fit
without
giving
a
reason
for
the
act
if
by
his
labor
the
tenant
made
the
land
more
fertile
he
seldom
reaped
any
additional
profit
from
his
industry
for
the
rent
was
usually
increased
and
swallowed
up
all
that
he
raised
such
a
system
of
extortion
was
destructive
to
those
who
tilled
the
soil
and
if
it
brought
in
more
money
for
the
landlord
it
produced
nothing
but
misery
and
discontent
for
his
tenant
gladstone
new
law
endeavored
to
remedy
these
evils
by
the
following
provisions
in
case
a
landlord
ejected
a
tenant
he
was
to
pay
him
damages
and
allow
him
a
fair
sum
for
whatever
improvement
he
had
made
it
secured
a
ready
means
of
arbitration
between
landlord
and
tenant
and
if
a
tenant
failed
to
pay
an
exorbitant
rate
he
could
not
be
hastily
or
unjustly
driven
from
his
farm
it
made
it
possible
for
the
tenant
to
borrow
a
certain
sum
from
the
government
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
the
land
in
case
the
owner
was
willing
to
sell
distress
in
ireland
the
land
league
the
friends
of
the
new
irish
land
law
hoped
it
would
be
found
satisfactory
but
the
potato
crop
again
failed
in
ireland
and
the
country
seemed
threatened
with
another
great
famine
thousands
who
could
not
get
the
means
to
pay
even
a
moderate
rent
were
now
forced
to
leave
their
cabins
and
seek
shelter
in
the
bogs
with
the
prospect
of
dying
there
of
starvation
the
wrected
condition
of
the
people
led
an
number
of
influential
irishmen
to
for
a
land
league
this
organization
sought
to
abolish
the
entire
landlord
system
in
ireland
and
to
secure
legislation
which
should
eventually
give
the
irish
peasantry
possession
of
the
soil
they
cultivated
in
time
the
league
grew
to
have
a
membership
of
several
hundred
thousand
persons
extending
over
the
greater
part
of
ireland
finding
it
difficult
to
get
parliamentary
help
for
their
grievances
the
league
resolved
to
try
a
different
kind
of
tactics
its
members
refused
to
work
for
buy
from
sell
to
or
have
any
intercourse
with
landlords
or
their
agents
who
extorted
exhorbitant
rent
ejected
tenants
unable
to
pay
or
took
possession
of
land
from
which
tenants
had
been
unjustly
driven
this
process
of
social
excommunication
was
first
tried
on
an
english
agent
or
overseer
named
boycott
and
soon
became
famous
under
the
name
of
boycotting
as
the
struggle
went
on
many
of
the
suffering
poor
became
desperate
farm
buildings
belonging
to
landlords
and
their
agents
were
burned
many
of
their
cattle
were
horribly
mutilated
and
a
number
of
the
agents
shot
at
the
same
time
the
cry
rose
of
no
rent
death
to
the
landlords
hundreds
of
irish
tenants
now
refused
to
pay
anything
for
the
use
of
the
land
they
cultivated
and
attacked
those
who
did
eventually
the
lawlessness
of
the
country
compelled
the
government
to
take
severe
measures
it
suppressed
the
land
league
which
was
believed
to
be
responsible
for
the
refusal
to
pay
rent
and
for
the
accompanying
outrages
but
it
could
not
extinguish
the
feeling
which
gave
rise
to
that
organization
and
the
angry
discontent
soon
burst
forth
more
violently
than
ever
the
second
irish
land
act
fenian
and
communist
outrages
gladstone
now
succeeded
in
carrying
through
a
second
irish
land
law
which
he
hoped
might
be
more
effective
in
relieving
the
irish
peasants
than
the
first
had
been
this
measure
was
familiarly
known
as
the
three
f
meaning
fair
rent
fixity
of
tenure
and
free
sale
by
the
provisions
of
this
act
the
tenant
could
appeal
to
a
board
of
land
commissioners
appointed
to
fix
the
rate
of
his
rent
in
case
the
demands
made
by
the
landlord
seemed
to
him
excessive
next
he
could
continue
to
hold
his
farm
provided
he
paid
the
rate
determined
on
for
a
period
of
fifteen
years
during
which
time
the
rent
could
not
be
raised
nor
the
tenant
evicted
except
for
violation
of
agreement
or
persistent
neglect
or
waste
of
the
land
finally
he
could
sell
his
tenancy
whenever
he
saw
fit
to
the
highest
bidder
this
law
was
later
amended
and
extended
in
the
interest
of
the
peasant
farmer
the
year
following
the
passage
of
this
second
land
act
lord
frederick
cavendish
chief
secretary
of
ireland
and
burke
a
prominent
government
official
were
murdered
in
phoenix
park
dublin
later
members
of
the
fenian
society
and
of
other
secret
organizations
sympathizing
with
the
small
irish
farmers
perpetrated
dynamite
outrages
in
london
and
other
parts
of
england
for
the
purpose
of
intimidating
the
government
these
acts
were
denounced
by
the
leaders
of
the
irish
national
party
they
declared
that
the
cause
of
ireland
was
not
to
be
served
by
the
knife
of
the
assassin
or
by
the
infernal
machine
notwithstanding
the
vindictive
feeling
caused
by
these
rash
deeds
despite
also
the
passage
of
the
coercion
bill
the
majority
of
the
more
intelligent
and
thoughtful
of
the
irish
people
had
faith
in
the
progress
of
events
they
believed
that
the
time
would
come
when
their
country
would
obtain
the
enjoyment
of
all
the
political
rights
which
england
so
fully
possesses
it
will
be
seen
that
about
ten
years
later
they
did
gain
a
very
important
extension
of
the
right
of
local
see
summary
of
constitutional
history
in
the
appendix
the
darwinian
theory
of
evolution
the
persistence
of
force
in
the
progress
of
science
the
victorian
period
surpassed
all
previous
records
in
england
except
that
made
by
sir
isaac
newton
discovery
of
the
law
of
gravitation
that
great
thinker
demonstrated
in
that
all
forms
of
matter
great
or
small
near
or
distant
are
governed
by
one
universal
force
of
attraction
in
like
manner
the
researches
and
investigations
of
the
nineteenth
century
led
to
the
conviction
that
all
forms
of
life
upon
the
earth
obey
a
universal
law
of
development
by
this
law
the
higher
are
evolved
from
the
lower
through
a
succession
of
gradual
but
progressive
changes
this
conception
originated
long
before
the
beginning
of
the
victorian
era
but
it
lacked
the
support
of
carefully
examined
facts
and
most
sensible
men
regarded
it
as
nothing
more
than
a
plausible
conjecture
the
thinker
who
did
more
than
any
other
to
supply
the
facts
and
to
put
the
theory
so
far
as
it
relates
to
natural
history
on
a
solid
and
lasting
foundation
was
the
distinguished
english
naturalist
charles
darwin
alfred
russel
wallace
also
noted
as
a
naturalist
worked
out
the
thoery
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
about
the
same
time
though
not
so
fully
with
respect
to
details
as
darwin
as
each
of
these
investigators
arrived
at
his
conclusions
independently
of
the
other
the
theory
was
thus
doubly
confirmed
on
his
return
from
a
voyage
of
scientific
discovery
round
the
world
darwin
began
to
examine
and
classify
the
facts
which
he
had
collected
and
continued
to
collect
relating
to
certain
forms
of
animal
life
after
years
of
uninterrupted
labor
he
published
a
work
in
entitled
the
origin
of
species
in
which
he
aimed
to
show
that
life
generally
owes
its
course
of
development
ot
the
struggle
for
existence
and
to
the
survival
of
the
fittest
darwin
work
may
truthfully
be
said
to
have
wrought
a
revolution
in
the
study
of
nature
as
great
as
that
accomplished
by
newton
in
the
seventeenth
century
though
it
excited
heated
and
prolonged
discussion
the
darwinian
theory
gradually
made
its
way
and
is
now
generall
received
though
sometimes
in
a
modified
form
by
practically
every
eminent
man
of
science
throughout
the
world
after
darwin
began
his
researches
but
before
he
completed
them
sir
william
grove
an
eminent
electrician
commenced
a
series
of
experiments
which
resulted
in
his
publishing
his
remarkable
book
on
the
connection
of
the
physical
forces
of
nature
he
showed
that
heat
light
and
electricity
are
mutually
convertible
that
they
must
be
regarded
as
modes
of
motion
and
finally
that
all
force
is
persistent
and
indestructible
thus
proving
as
professor
tyndall
says
that
to
nature
nothing
can
be
added
from
nature
nothing
can
be
taken
away
together
the
work
of
darwin
and

with

discoveries
resulted
in
the

to
make
it
the

embracing
the
whole
field
of

and

of

the

period
was
also
noted
for
many
other
great

in

the
number
was
so
great
that
it

manifestly
be

to
devote

queen
victoria
celebrated
the
fiftieth
year
of
her
reign
ten
years
later
the
nation
spontaneously
rose
to
do
honor
to
her
diamond
jubilee
the
splendid
military
pageant
which
marked
that
event
in
london
was
far
more
than
a
brilliant
show
for
it
demonstrated
the
enthusiastic
loyalty
of
the
english
people
and
of
the
english
colonies
the
real
meaning
of
the
occasion
is
best
sought
in
a
review
of
the
record
of
those
threescore
years
they
were
in
large
degree
a
period
of
progress
perhaps
in
fact
no
similar
period
in
european
history
has
been
so
crowded
with
benefit
to
humanity
when
victoria
came
to
the
throne
in
her
nineteenth
year
she
found
the
kingdom
seething
with
discontent
and
the
province
of
canada
approaching
rebellion
in
business
circles
reckless
speculation
and
the
bursting
of
bubble
companies
had
been
followed
by
tight
money
and
hard
times
among
the
poor
matters
were
far
worse
wages
were
low
work
was
scarce
bread
was
dear
in
the
cities
multitudes
lived
in
cellars
in
the
country
the
same
class
occupied
wretched
cottages
hardly
better

the
new
poor
law
which
went
into
effect
in
or
shortly
before
the
queen
accession
eventually
accomplished
much
good
but
for
a
time
it
forced
many
laborers
into
the
workhouse
the
result
aggravated
the
suffering
and
discontent
and
the
predominant
feeling
of
the
day
may
be
seen
reflected
in
the
pages
of
dickens
carlyle
and
kingsley
the
new
poor
law
between
and
the
administration
of
relief
for
the
poor
was
in
the
hands
of
justices
of
the
peace
who
gave
aid
indiscriminately
to
those
who
begged
for
it
in
wages
for
ordinary
laborers
were
so
low
that
the
justices
resolved
to
grant
an
allowance
to
every
poor
family
in
accordance
with
its
numbers
the
result
of
this
mistaken
kindness
was
speedily
seen
employers
cut
down
wages
to
the
starvation
point
knowing
that
the
magistrates
would
give
help
out
of
the
poor
fund
the
consequence
was
that
the
tax
rate
for
relief
of
the
poor
rose
to
a
degree
that
became
unbearable
the
new
law
of
effected
a
sweeping
reform
it
forbade
outdoor
relief
to
the
poor
and
thus
in
the
end
compelled
the
employer
to
give
better
wages
but
outdoor
relief
is
now
frequently
granted
it
restricted
aid
to
that
given
in
workhouses
where
the
recipient
if
in
good
health
was
obliged
to
labor
in
return
for
what
he
received
it
greatly
reduced
the
expense
of
supporting
the
poor
by
uniting
parishes
in
workhouse
unions
it
modified
the
old
rigid
law
of
settlement
thereby
making
it
possible
for
those
seeking
employment
to
take
their
labor
to
the
best
market

notwithstanding
the
passage
of
the
reform
bill
of
political
power
was
still
held
chiefly
by
men
of
property
who
distrusted
the
masses
of
the
people
they
feared
that
the
widespread
distress
would
culminate
in
riots
if
not
in
open
insurrection
the
chartist
movement
which
speedily
began
seemed
to
justify
their
apprehension
but
the
dreaded
revolt
never
came
the
evils
of
the
times
were
gradually
alleviated
and
in
some
cases
cured
confidence
slowly
took
the
place
of
distrust
and
fear
when
in
june
the
queen
diamond
jubilee
procession
moved
from
buckingham
palace
to
paul
and
thence
through
some
of
the
poorest
quarters
of
london
none
of
the
dense
mass
that
filled
the
streets
cheered
more
lustily
than
those
who
must
always
earn
their
daily
bread
by
their
daily
toil
the
explanation
of
that
change
was
to
be
found
in
the
progress
of
good
government
the
extension
of
popular
rights
and
the
advance
of
material
improvements
let
us
consider
these
changes
in
their
natural
order
further
extension
of
the
right
to
vote
we
have
already
described
the
effects
of
the
reform
bill
of
which
on
the
one
hand
put
an
end
to
many
rotten
boroughs
and
on
the
other
granted
representation
in
parliament
to
a
number
of
large
towns
hitherto
without
a
voice
in
that
body
three
years
later
came
the
municipal
reform
act
it
placed
the
government
of
towns
with
the
exception
of
london
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayers
who
lived
in
them
see
summary
of
constitutional
history
in
the
appendix
the
ancient
city
of
london
or
london
proper
is
a
district
covering
about
a
square
mile
and
was
once
enclosed
in
walls
it
is
still
governed
by
a
lord
mayor
court
of
aldermen
and
a
common
council
elected
mainly
by
members
of
the
city
companies
representing
the
medieval
trade
guilds
the
metropolis
outside
the
city
is
governed
by
the
london
county
council
and
a
number
of
associate
bodies
among
which
are
the
councils
of
metropolitan
boroughs
this
radical
measure
put
a
stop
to
the
arbitrary
and
corrupt
management
which
had
existed
when
the
town
officers
elected
themselves
and
held
their
positions
for
life
futhermore
it
prevented
parliamentary
candidates
from
buying
up
the
entire
municipal
vote
a
thing
which
frequently
happened
so
long
as
the
towns
were
under
the
absolute
control
of
a
few
individuals
a
generation
passed
before
the
next
important
step
was
taken
then
as
we
have
seen
the
enactment
of
the
second
reform
bill
doubled
the
number
of
voters
in
england
the
next
year
an
act
reduced
the
property
qualification
for
the
right
to
vote
in
scotland
and
ireland
thus
the
ballot
was
largely
increased
throughout
the
united
kingdom
the
third
reform
act
granted
the
right
to
vote
for
members
of
parliament
to
more
than
two
million
persons
chiefly
to
the
farm
laborers
and
other
workingmen
since
that
date
whether
the
liberals
or
the
conservatives
have
been
in
power
the
country
as
professor
gardiner
says
has
been
under
democratic
influence
the
whigs
included
two
elements
one
aristocratic
and
the
other
radical
after
the
passage
of
the
reform
bill
of
they
took
the
name
of
liberals
and
the
tories
who
found
their
old
name
unpopular
adopted
that
of
conservatives
but
though
these
acts
wrought
an
immense
change
by
transferring
political
power
from
the
hands
of
the
few
to
the
greater
part
of
the
nation
further
progress
in
this
direction
was
destined
to
come
soon
originally
the
government
of
the
shires
or
counties
was
in
the
hands
of
the
people
they
gradually
lost
it
and
the
wealthy
landed
proprietors
obtained
control
the
local
government
or
county
councils
act
restored
the
power
in
great
measure
to
those
who
had
parted
with
it
by
putting
the
management
of
county
affairs
under
the
direction
of
the
county
councils
elected
by
the
householders
of
the
counties
or
shires
these
councils
look
after
the
highways
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
towns
the
education
of
children
and
the
care
of
the
poor
six
years
later
the
principle
of
was
carried
almost
to
the
farthest
point
by
the
passage
of
the
parish
councils
bill
this
measure
did
for
country
villages
and
other
small
places
what
the
local
government
act
did
for
the
counties
it
gave
back
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
parishes
certain
rights
which
they
had
once
possessed
but
which
had
gradually
come
under
the
control
of
the
squire
the
parson
and
a
few
privileged
families
parish
this
name
was
given
originally
to
a
district
assigned
to
a
bishop
or
priest
at
present
it
generally
refers
simply
to
the
area
which
was
formerly
contained
in
such
a
district
the
squire
was
the
chief
landholder
in
a
village
or
parish
the
parson
the
minister
of
the
parish
church
now
every
man
and
woman
who
has
resided
in
the
parish
for
a
twelvemonth
has
the
right
not
only
to
vote
for
the
members
of
the
parish
council
but
to
run
as
candidate
for
election
to
that
body
the
village
parliament
discusses
all
questions
which
are
of
public
interest
to
the
parish
it
is
in
some
respects
more
democratic
even
than
a
new
england
town
meeting
since
it
gives
women
a
voice
a
vote
and
opportunity
to
hold
office
its
work
supplements
that
of
the
county
councils
and
of
parliament
overthrow
of
the
spoils
system
the
army
the
secret
ballot
meanwhile
reforms
not
less
important
had
been
effected
in
the
management
of
the
civil
service
the
ancient
power
of
the
crown
to
give
fat
pensions
to
its
favorites
had
been
pared
down
to
very
modest
proportions
but
another
great
abuse
still
flourished
like
an
evil
weed
in
rich
soil
for
generations
public
offices
had
been
regarded
as
public
plunder
and
the
watchword
of
the
politicians
was
every
man
for
himself
and
the
national
treasury
for
us
all
under
this
system
of
pillage
the
successful
party
in
an
election
came
down
like
a
flock
of
vultures
after
a
battle
they
secured
all
the
spoils
form
petty
clerkships
worth
pounds
a
year
up
to
places
worth
thousands
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
an
effort
was
made
to
break
up
this
corrupt
and
corrupting
system
but
the
real
work
was
not
accomplished
until
in
that
year
england
threw
open
the
majority
of
the
positions
in
the
civil
service
to
competitive
examination
henceforth
the
poorest
day
laborer
whether
man
or
woman
might
if
competent
ask
for
any
one
of
many
places
which
formerly
some
influential
man
or
political
boss
reserved
as
gifts
for
those
who
obeyed
his
commands
the
next
year
the
purchase
of
commissions
in
the
army
was
abolished
this
established
the
merit
system
in
the
ranks
and
now
military
honors
and
military
offices
are
open
to
all
who
can
earn
them
up
to
an
officer
retiring
from
the
army
could
sell
his
commission
to
any
officer
next
below
him
in
rank
who
had
the
money
to
buy
the
position
whereas
under
the
present
system
the
vacancy
would
necessarily
fall
to
senior
officers
in
the
line
of
promotion
in
the
year
following
this
salutary
change
the
entire
british
army
was
reorganized
the
registration
act
of
required
every
voter
to
have
his
name
and
residence
recorded
on
a
public
list
this
did
away
with
election
frauds
to
a
large
extent
it
was
supplemented
in
by
the
introduction
of
the
secret
ballot
this
put
an
end
to
the
intimidation
of
voters
and
to
the
free
fights
and
riots
which
had
so
frequently
made
the
polls
a
political
pandemonium
the
bribery
act
of
was
another
important
measure
which
did
much
toward
stopping
the
wholesale
purchase
of
votes
by
wealthy
candidates
or
by
powerful
corporations
reforms
in
law
procedures
during
queen
victoria
reign
great
changes
for
the
better
were
effected
in
simplifying
the
laws
and
the
administration
of
justice
when
she
came
to
the
throne
the
parliamentary
statutes
at
large
filled
huge
folio
volumes
and
the
common
law
as
contained
in
judicial
decisions
from
the
time
of
edward
ii
filled
about
twelve
hundred
more
the
work
of
examining
digesting
and
consolidating
this
enormous
mass
of
legislative
and
legal
lore
was
taken
in
hand
and
has
been
slowly
progressing
ever
since
the
judicature
acts
united
the
chief
courts
in
a
single
high
court
of
justice
this
reform
did
away
with
much
confusion
and
expense
but
the
most
striking
changes
for
the
better
were
those
made
in
the
court
of
chancery
and
the
criminal
courts
in
the
property
belonging
to
suitors
in
the
former
court
amounted
to
nearly
forty
millions
of
pounds
the
simplest
case
might
require
a
dozen
years
for
its
settlement
while
difficult
ones
consumed
a
lifetime
or
more
and
were
handed
down
from
father
to

much
has
been
done
to
remedy
these
evils
which
dickens
set
forth
with
such
power
in
his
novel
of
bleak
house
at
one
time
the
prospect
of
reform
seemed
so
utterly
hopeless
that
it
was
customary
for
a
prize
fighter
when
he
had
got
his
opponent
neck
twisted
under
his
arm
and
held
him
absolutely
helpless
to
declare
that
he
had
his
head
in
chancery
reforms
in
criminal
courts
and
in
the
treatment
of
the
insane
in
criminal
courts
an
equal
reform
was
effected
and
men
accused
of
burglary
and
murder
are
now
allowed
to
have
counsel
to
defend
them
and
the
right
of
appeal
is
secured
whereas
up
to
the
era
of
victoria
they
were
obliged
to
plead
their
own
cases
as
best
they
might
against
skilled
public
prosecutors
who
used
every
resource
known
to
the
law
to
convict
them
great
changes
for
the
better
have
also
taken
place
in
the
treatment
of
the
insane
until
near
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
unfortunate
class
was
quite
generally
regarded
as
possessed
by
demons
and
dealt
with
accordingly
william
tuke
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
inaugurated
a
better
system
but
the
old
method
continued
for
many
years
longer
in
fact
we
have
the
highest
authority
for
saying
that
down
to
a
pretty
late
period
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
inmates
of
many
asylums
were
worse
off
than
the
most
desperate
criminals
they
were
shut
up
in
dark
and
often
filthy
cells
where
they
were
chained
to
the
wall
flogged
starved
and
not
infrequently
killed
since
then
mechanical
restraints
have
as
a
rule
been
abolished
and
the
patients
are
generally
treated
with
the
care
and
kindness
which
their
condition
demands

progress
in
the
education
of
the
masses
we
have
seen
that
since
the
advance
in
popular
education
equaled
that
made
in
the
extension
of
suffrage
and
in
civil
service
reform
when
victoria
began
her
reign
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
children
of
the
poor
were
growing
up
in
a
stat
bordering
on
barbarism
many
of
them
knew
little
more
of
books
or
schools
than
the
young
hottentots
in
africa
the
marriage
register
shows
that
as
late
as
forty
per
cent
of
the
queen
adult
subjects
could
not
write
their
names
in
the
book
by
the
close
of
her
reign
the
number
who
had
to
make
their
mark
in
that
interesting
volume
was
only
about
one
in
ten
this
proves
as
lord
brougham
said
that
the

been
abroad

the
national

of

began
as
we
have
already
seen
in

made
provision
for
those
who
had
not
means
to
pay
even
a

abolition
of
religious
tests
for
degrees
at
oxford
and
cambridge
threw
open
the
doors
of
those
venerable
seats
of
learning
to
students
of
every
faith
since
then
colleges
for
women
have
been
established
at
oxford
and
in
the
vicinity
of
cambridge
and
the
examinations
with
college
settlements
in
london
and
other
large
cities
have
long
been
doing
excellent
work
the
religious
toleration
granted
in
the
universities
was
in
accord
with
the
general
movement
of
the
age
it
wil
be
remembered
that
the
catholics
were
readmitted
to
sit
in
parliament
late
in
the
reign
of
george
iv
and
that
under
victoria
the
jews
were
admitted
to
the
same
right
finally
bradlaugh
got
his
oaths
bill
passed
and
so
opened
parliament
to
persons
not
only
of
all
religious
beliefs
but
of
none
in
the
meantime
the
compulsory
payment
of
rates
for
the
support
of
the
church
of
england
had
been
abolished
and
the
next
year
was
made
memorable
by
the
just
and
generous
act
by
which
gladstone
disestablished
the
irish
branch
of
the
english
church
transportation
and
communication
when
the
queen
ascended
the
throne
the
locomotive
was
threatening
to
supersede
the
stagecoach
but
the
progerss
of
steam
as
a
motor
power
on
land
had
not
been
rapid
and
england
then
had
less
than
miles
of
railway
open
but
before
the
end
of
her
reign
there
were
nearly
miles
in
operation
and
there
are
now
at
first
the
passenger
accommodations
were
limited
those
who
could
indulge
in
such
luxuries
sometimes
preferred
to
travel
in
their
own
private
carriages
placed
on
platform
cars
for
transportation
for
those
who
took
tickets
there
were
excellent
and
roomy
compartments
at
very
high
prices
the
second
class
fared
tolerably
well
on
uncushioned
seats
but
the
unfortunate
third
class
were
crowded
like
cattle
into
open
trucks
without
seats
and
with
no
roofs
to
keep
the
rain
out
but
time
remedied
this
long
before
the
queen
celebrated
her
first
jubilee
the
workingman
could
fly
through
the
country
at
the
rate
of
from
thirty
to
fifty
miles
an
hour
for
a
penny
a
mile
and
could
have
all
the
comforts
that
a
reasonable
being
should
ask
for
a
part
of
what
is
now
the
london
and
northwestern
railway
cheap
postage
came
in
with
the
extension
of
railways
and
in
a
few
years
the
amount
of
mail
carried
increased
enormously
every
letter
for
the
first
time
carried
on
it
a
stamp
bearing
a
portrait
of
the
young
queen
and
in
this
way
the
english
people
came
to
know
her
better
than
they
had
ever
known
any
preceding
sovereign
the
london
papers
now
reached
the
country
by
train
the
telegraph
began
to
come
into
use
in
january
between
the
railway
station
at
paddington
a
western
district
of
london
and
slough
near
windsor
the
government
eventually
purchased
all
the
lines
and
reduced
the
charge
on
a
despatch
of
twelve
words
to

the

match
the
abolition
of
the

on

with
the
introduction
of
american
petroleum
speedily
dispelled
the
almost
subterraneous
gloom
of
the
laborer
cottage
meanwhile
photography
which
began
to
be
used
in
revealed
the
astonishing
fact
that
the
sun
is
always
ready
not
only
to
make
a
picture
but
to
take
one
and
that
nothing
is
so
humble
as
to
be
beneath
his
notice
news
came
across
the
atlantic
from
boston
that
morton
had
rendered
surgery
painless
by
the
use
of
ether
before
a
year
passed
the
english
hospitals
were
employing
it
sir
james
simpson
of
edinburgh
introduced
chloroform
these
two
agents
have
abolished
the
terror
of
the
surgeon
knife
and
have
lengthened
life
by
making
it
possible
to
perform
a
class
of
operations
which
formerly
very
few
patients
had
been
able
to
bear
a
score
of
years
later
sir
joseph
lister
called
attention
to
the
important
results
obtained
by
antiseptic
methods
in
surgery
next
came
the
introduction
from
germany
of
the
marvelous
x
ray
by
whose
help
the
operator
can
photograph
and
locate
a
bullet
or
other
foreign
substance
which
he
is
endeavoring
to
extract
together
these
discoveries
have
saved
multitudes
of
lives
progress
of
the
laboring
classes
free
trade
at
the
date
of
the
queen
accession
a
number
of
laws
existed
restricting
the
free
action
of
workingmen
only
three
years
before
victoria
coronation
six
poor
agricultural
laborers
in
dorsetshire
were
transported
to
penal
servitude
at
botany
bay
australia
for
seven
years
for
peacefully
combining
to
secure
an
increase
of
their
wages
which
at
that
time
were
only
six
shilling
a
week
in
fact
the
conspiracy
laws
which
made
labor
unions
liable
to
prosecution
as
unlawful
if
not
actually
criminal
organizations
were
not
wholly
repealed
until
after
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
meanwhile
parliament
passed
the
trade
union
acts
in
and
which
recognized
the
right
of
workingmen
to
form
associations
to
protect
their
interests
by
the
use
of
all
measures
not
forbidden
by
the
common
law
in
the
persistent
political
pressure
of
organized
labor
induced
a
liberal
cabinet
of
which
sir
henry
was
prime
minister
and
the
invariably
conservative
house
of
lords
to
pass
a
still
more
important
act
that
measure
exempted
trade
unions
from
liability
to
pay
damages
for
a
certain
class
of
injuries
which
they
might
commit
in
carrying
on
a
strike
during
the
above
period
of
more
than
thirty
years
the
unions
have
gained
very
largely
in
numbers
and
in
financial
as
well
as
political
strength
on
the
other
hand
they
now
have
to
contend
with
the
radical
socialists
who
are
seeking
to
convert
england
into
a
republic
in
which
the
government
would
carry
on
all
industries
and
would
prohibit
private
individuals
from
conducting
any
business
whatever
one
result
of
the
organization
of
trades
or
labor
unions
has
been
the
shortening
of
the
hours
of
labor
in
the
government
established
an
day
for
workingmen
in
dockyards
and
in
ordnance
factories
the
trade
disputes
act
of
this
forbids
any
suit
for
tort
against
a
trade
union
see
lowell
the
government
of
england
ii
and
gompers
in
for
february
the
unions
will
accomplish
more
still
if
they
succeed
in
teaching
their
members
to
study
the
condition
of
industry
in
england
to
respect
the
action
of
those
workers
who
do
not
join
associations
and
to
see
clearly
that
if
men
have
a
right
to
combine
they
must
also
have
an
equal
right
to
refuse
to
combine
in
the
english
corn
laws
virtually
shut
out
the
importation
of
grain
from
foreign
countries
the
population
had
outgroiwn
its
food
supply
and
bread
was
so
dear
that
even
the
agricultural
laborer
cried
out
i
be
protected
said
he
but
i
be
starving
the
long
and
bitter
fight
against
the
corn
laws
resulted
not
only
in
their
gradual
abolition
but
in
the
opening
of
english
ports
to
the
products
and
manufactures
of
the
world
with
the
exception
of
tobacco
wines
spirits
and
a
few
other
articles
all
imports
enter
the
kingdom
free
but
though
great
britain
carries
out
the
theory
that
it
is
better
to
make
things
cheap
for
the
sake
of
those
who
buy
them
than
it
is
to
make
them
dear
for
the
sake
of
those
who
produce
them
yet
all
of
the
great
english
colonies
impose
protective
duties
even
against
british
products
one
of
the
interesting
questions
suggested
by
the
queen
diamond
jubilee
was
whether
england
children
in
australia
new
zealand
and
canada
would
take
any
steps
toward
forming
a
commercial
union
with
the
mother
country
more
than
ten
years
later
that
point
still
remained
under
discussion
except
in
certain
cases
where
the
colonies
canada
grant
preferential
duties
or
practical
free
trade
in
certain
articles
exported
to
the
british
isles
the
small
agricultural
holdings
act
the
agricultural
outlook
through
the
influence
of
the
greatly
increased
popular
vote
which
resulted
from
the
third
reform
act
the
farm
laborers
made
themselves
felt
in
the
house
of
commons
they
secured
the
passage
of
the
small
agricultural
holdings
act
this
gave
those
who
worked
on
the
land
the
privilege
of
purchasing
from
one
to
fifty
acres
or
of
taking
it
on
lease
if
they
preferred
but
notwithstanding
the
relief
granted
by
this
measure
the
agricultural
problem
is
one
of
the
most
serious
england
has
to
solve
just
as
new
england
now
depends
in
large
measure
on
the
west
for
its
food
supply
so
the
british
isles
depend
in
great
measure
on
america
for
breadstuffs
thousands
of
acres
of
fertile
soil
have
gone
out
of
cultivation
in
the
eastern
half
of
the
island
mainly
because
the
farmers
can
not
compete
with
foreign
wheat
the
small
agricultural
holdings
act
enables
the
county
council
to
acquire
by
voluntary
arrangement
suitable
land
for
the
purpose
of
reletting
or
reselling
it
to
agricultural
laborers
and
men
of
small
means
under
certain
safeguards
the
council
may
advance
up
to
three
fourths
of
the
purchase
money
the
royal
agricultural
commission
in
a
report
made
a
number
of
years
ago
could
suggest
no
remedy
and
believed
matters
must
grow
worse
a
leading
english
journal
in
commenting
on
the
report
said
the
sad
and
sober
fact
is
that
the
english
farmer
occupation
is
gone
or
nearly
gone
never
to
return
the
bristol
and
august
the
continued
agricultural
depression
ruined
many
tillers
of
the
soil
and
drove
the
rural
population
more
and
more
into
the
already
overcrowded
towns
there
they
bid
against
the
laboring
men
for
work
and
so
reduced
wages
to
the
lowest
point
if
they
failed
to
get
work
they
became
an
added
burden
on
the
poor
rates
and
taxes
rose
accordingly
should
no
remedy
be
found
and
should
land
in
england
continue
to
go
out
of
cultivation
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
majority
of
proprietors
can
resist
the
temptation
to
break
up
and
sell
their
estates
the
tendency
of
an
important
act
of
parliament
is
believed
by
many
to
work
in
the
same
direction
it
imposes
an
inheritance
tax
on
the
heirs
to
landed
property
which
they
find
it
hard
to
meet
especially
when
their
tenants
have
abandoned
their
farms
rather
than
try
to
pay
the
rent
the
consolidated
death
duties
act
a
few
thousand
wealthy
families
hold
the
title
deeds
to
a
large
part
of
the
soil
on
which
more
than
forty
millions
live
generally
speaking
the
rent
they
demand
does
not
seem
to
be
excessive
it
is
an
open
question
whether
england
would
be
the
gainer
if
as
in
france
the
land
should
be
cut
up
into
small
holdings
worked
by
men
without
capital
and
hence
without
power
to
make
improvements
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
royal
commission
but
industry
in
england
takes
the
opposite
view
the
colonial
expansion
of
england
meanwhile
whether
from
an
economic
point
of
view
england
is
gaining
or
losing
at
home
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
her
colonial
expansion

the

was
simply

geographical
expression
the

scarcely
anything
was
known
of
the

back
of
it
through
the

of

become

great
fields

is
determined
to
control
if
not
to
possess
on
the
other
hand
the
british
west
indies
have
of
late
years
greatly
declined
from
their
former
prosperity
the
english
demand
for
cheap
sugar
has
encouraged
the
importation
of
sugar
from
germany
and
france
this
has
reduced
the
market
for

to
so
low
a
point
that
there
has
been

given
to

colonial

ministers
there
was
a
time
indeed
when
the
men
who
governed
england
regarded
canada
and
australia
as
a
source
of
weakness
and
the
colonial
office
in

knew
so
little
of

country
that
it

was
to
uphold
the
british

and
to
do
everything
to
maintain

it

refused
as
a
rule
to
take

in

felt
that

never

placed
on

and
more
prosperous
neighbor
in
fact
the

appointed
to
inquire
into
the
relative

of

reported
nearly
unanimously
that
for
a
great
many
years
ireland
had
paid
annually
more
than
pounds
beyond
her
just
proportion
of

on
what
was
practically
a

foundation
later
england
by
a
treaty
known
as
the
sand
river
convention
virtually
recognized
the
independence
of
the
settlers
in

transvaal
and
two
years
afterwards
made

still
more

recognition
of
the
independence
of

the
zulus
and
other
fierce
native
tribes
bordering
on
the
transvaal
hated
the
boers
and
threatened

eat
them
up
later
england
thought
it
for
her
interest
and
for
that
of
the
boers
as
well
to
annex
the
transvaal
the
english
governor
did
not
grant
the
boers
the
measure
of
political
liberty
which
he
had
promised
this
led
to
a
revolt
and
a
small
body
of
english
soldiers
was
beaten
at
majuba
hill
gladstone
the
liberal
prime
minister
did
not
think
that
the
conquest
of
the
transvaal
supposing
it
to
be
justifiable
would
pay
for
its
cost
and
he
accordingly
made
a
treaty
with
the
people
of
that
country
lord
beaconsfield
thought
this
policy
a
serious
mistake
and
that
it
would
lead
to
trouble
later
on
he
said
we
have
failed
to
whip
the
boy
and
we
shall
have
to
fight
the

the
gladstone
treaty
acknowledged
the
right
of
the
boers
to
govern
themselves
but
subject
to
english
control
three
years
later
that
treaty
was
modified
the
boers
declared
that
the
english
then
gave
up
all
control
over
them
except
with
regard
to
the
power
to
make
treaties
which
might
conflict
with
the
interests
of
great
britain
but
this
statement
the
english
government
emphatically
denied
the
preamble
of
the
convention
or
agreement
made
between
england
and
the
boers
in
at
pretoria
the
capital
of
the
transvaal

subject
to
the
suzerainty
of

majesty
queen

in

convention
of
made
at
london
the
word
suzerainty
was
dropped
but
chamberlain
colonial
secretary
of

britain
contended
that
it
was
implied
or
understood
this
interpretation
of
the
agreement
president
kruger
of

south
african
or

republic
absolutely
rejected
the
discovery
of
diamond
fields
in
cape
colony
and
of
the
richest
gold
mines
in
the
world
in
the
transvaal
stimulated
a
great
emigration
of
english
to
south
africa
in
a
few
years
the
outlanders
as
the
boers
called
all
foreigners
outnumbered
the
boers
themselves
the
outlanders
who
worked
the
gold
mines
and
paid
nearly
all
the
taxes
complained
that
the
laws
made
by
the
boers
were
unjust
and
oppressive
they
demanded
the
right
to
vote
the
boers
on
the
other
hand
refused
to
give
them
that
right
except
under
arduous
restrictions
lest
the
foreigners
should
get
the
upper
hand
in
the
transvaal
republic
and
then
manage
it
to
suit
themselves
things
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
at
length
a
prominent
englishman
of
cape
colony
jameson
armed
a
small
body
of
outlanders
who
undertook
to
get
by
force
what
they
could
not
get
by
persuasion
the
boers
captured
the
revolutionists
and
compelled
some
of
the
leaders
to
pay
in
all
about
a
million
dollars

fines
jameson
was
sent
to
england
and
imprisoned

short
time

committee
appointed

with
having
helped
on

time
the
feeling
of

more
intense

come
for

action
on

the
fires
so
long
smoldered
now

resolved

authority

and

chamberlain
who
was
in

cabinet
agreed
with
his
chief
that
the
sword
must
settle
the
question
but
he
said
that
the
contest
in

would
be
a
long
war
a
bitter
war
and
a
costly

events
proved
the
truth
of
part
of
his
prediction
the
contest
was
certainly
bitter
for
it
carried
sorrow
and
death
into
many
thousand

it
was
costly

england
finally

the
largest
army
she
ever
put
into
a
field
in
the
whole
course
of
her
history
the
great
majority
of
the
english
people
believed
that
the

was
inevitable

there
was
an
active
minority

insisted
that

the

in

was
remarkable
in
many
ways
the
chief
political
events
were
the
establishment
of
the
practical
supremacy
of
the
house
of

shown
by
the
fact
that
the

now
obliged
to
give
up
the
power
of
removing
the
prime

or
members
of

without
the

the

the

the

as
we
have
seen
while
england
maintains
free
trade
her
colonies
still
keep
up
a
strict
protective
tariff
and
impose
duties
even
on
british
imports
notwithstanding
this
difference
all
the
colonies
are
loyal
subjects
of
the
english
crown
and
all
stand
ready
to
defend

the

while
this
successful
movement
toward
imperial
federation
was
going
on
the
organization
of
the
league
of
empire
had
been
formed
to
cooperate
with
it
and
strengthen

the
league
is
nonpolitical
and
nonsectarian
it
aims
to
unite
the
different
parts
of
the
imperial
federation
by
intellectual
and
moral
bonds
it
appeals
to
the
whole
body
of
the
people
of

but
it
deals
especially
with
the
children
in
the
schools
it
endeavors
to
educate
them
in
the
duties
of
citizenship
and
it
calls
on
them
to
salute
the

as
the
symbol
of
patriotism
of
unity
and
of

a
little
later
empire

was
established
as

to

forward
the

king
edward
gave
it
his
hearty
encouragement
and
it
is
celebrated
throughout
the

the

influence
in
behalf
of
peace
while
seeking
to
make
all
england
and
english
dominions
in
one
spirit
king
edward
constantly
used
his
influence
to
maintain
peace
both
at
home
and
abroad
he
was
a
man
whose
natural
kindliness
of
heart
endowed
him
with
the
double
power
of
making
and
of
keeping
friends
furthermore
he
was
a
born
diplomatist
he
saw
at
once
the
best
method
of
handling
the
most
difficult
questions
those
who
knew
him
intimately
said
that
he
always
did
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
in
the
right
way
to
a
great
extent
he
was
a
creator
of
international
confidence
in
his
short
reign
he
succeeded
in
overcoming
the
old
race
feeling
which
made
england
and
france
regard
each
other
as
enemies
again
russia
and
england
had
been
on
unfriendly
terms
for
nearly
two
generations
but
the
king
by
his
strong
personal
influence
brought
the
two
countries
to
understand
each
other
better
he
saw
that
europe
needed
peace
he
saw
that
the
outbreak
of
a
general
war
would
strike
the
laboring
man
a
terrible
blow
and
would
destroy
the
fruits
of
his
toil
when
he
ascended
the
throne
the
contest
with
the
boers
in
south
africa
was
still
going
on
general
botha
one
of
the
boer
leaders
publicly
stated
that
the
king
did
everything
in
his
power
to
secure
the
establishment
of
an
honorable
and
permanent
peace
between
the
combatants
more
than
that
even
he
was
in
favor
of
granting
a
large
measure
of
to
the
very
people
who
had
only
just
laid
down
the
arms
with
which
they
had
been
fighting
him
but
the
king
influence
for
good
was
not
limited
to
the
old
world
it
extended
across
the
atlantic
choate
who
was
formerly
our
ambassador
to
england
said
that
edward
vii
endeavored
to
remove
every
cause
of
friction
between
great
britain
and
america
while
he
lay
on
a
sick
bed
he
signed
a
treaty
relating
to
the
panama
canal
which
made
it
possible
for
the
united

to
construct
the

and
to

the

came
in
the

wrought
a
silent

up
to

date
with
very
few
exceptions
the
wealthy
class
was
the
only
one
which
had
been
represented
in
the

furthermore
it
cost
a
good
deal
of
money
for
any

to

into
the

and
as

it
cost
a

the

with

with

it
also
has
at

one
serious
drawback
in
times
of

excitement
it
might
lead
to

passed

but
the
house

which
includes
the

in
the
british

rejected
it
they
declared
that
it
was
not
only
unjust
and
oppressive
but
that
it
was
a
long
step
toward
the
establishment
of
socialism
and
that
it
threatened
to
lead
to
the
confiscation
of
private
property
in

a
bitter
conflict
ensued
between
the
two
branches
of
parliament
this
contest
was
rendered
harder
by
the
actions
of
a
small
number
of
turbulent
women
who
demanded
complete
suffrage
but
failed
to
get
it
adopting
the
methods
of
a
football
team
they
endeavored

in

tried

in

they
broke
the

in
order
to
convince
the
country
of
their
fitness
to
take
part
in
making
them
over
six
hundred
of
these
offenders
were
put
in
prison
not
because
they
asked
for

but
because
they
deliberately
persistently
and
recklessly
misconducted
themselves

violent
methods
a

the

party
with

won
the
victory
but
with
a
decidedly
diminished
majority

the
liberal

declared
that
the
policy
of

government
forbade

whatever
to

the
lords
thought
it
unwise
to
carry

when

met
they
bowed
to

inevitable
and
reluctantly

they
would
either
request

england
has
felt
that

must
be
supplemented

two
of
these

airships
are

the
government
also
began
preparations
for
the
compilation
of
a
new
domesday
book
which
should
revalue
all
the
land
in
the
british
isles
in
order
to
establish
a
permanent

for
increased
taxation
the
house
of

furthermore
took
up
the
debate
on
adopting
measures
for
limiting
the
power
of
lords
to
veto
bills
passed
by
the
commons
while
they
were
so
engaged
king
edward
died

his

was
crowned
in
with
the
title
of

the
last
general
valuation
of
the
land
was
made
in
it
was
then
fixed
at
pounds
the
land
tax
based
on
this
valuation
has
yielded
about
pounds
annually
the
government
expects
that
the
new
valuation
will
yield
much
more
in
the
summer
of
asquith
the
liberal
prime
minister
after
prolonged
and
heated
discussion
forced
the
house
of
lords
to
accept
the
veto
bill
which
is
now
law
he
did
this
by
using
the
same
threat
which
enable
earl
grey
to
carry
the
reform
bill
of
the
veto
act
makes
it
impossible
for
the
house
of
lords
to
defeat
any
public
bill
which
the
house
of
commons
has
passed
for
three
successive
sessions
extending
over
a
period
of
not
less
than
two
years
this
momentous
act
was
passed
at
a
critical
time
when
the
great
dockers
strike
had
practically
closed
the
port
of
london
and
had
cut
off
the
chief
food
supply
of
the
city
a
little
later
the
prime
minister
passed
the
salary
bill
which
pays
the
members
of
the
house
of
commons
pounds
annually
next
the
government
passed
the
workmen
compulsory
insurance
bill
against
sickness
and
unemployment
the
worker
and
his
employer
contribute
small
sums
weekly
the
government
gives
the
rest
the
law
has
an
excellent
motive
general
summary
of
the
development
of
the
english
nation
such
is
the
condition
of
the
english
nation
in
the
twentieth
century
and
in
the
reign
of
king
george
looking
back
to
the
time
when
caesar
landed
in
britain
we
see
that
since
that
period
an
island
which
then
had
a
population
of
a
few
thousand
barbarians
has
gradually
become
the
center
of
a
great
and
powerful
empire
the
true
history
of
the
country
began
however
not
with
landing
but
with
the
saxon
invasion
in
about
five
centuries
later
then
the
fierce
german
and
scandinavian
races
living
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
and
north
seas
took
possession
of
britain
they
with
the
help
of
the
primitive
british
or
celtic
stock
laid
the
foundation
of
a
new
nation
their
speech
in
a
modified
form
their
laws
and
their
customs
became
in
large
degree
permanent
later
missionaries
from
rome
converted
this
mixed
population
to
the
christian
faith
they
baptized
britain
with
the
name
england
which
it
has
ever
since
retained
in
the
eleventh
century
the
normans
who
sprang
originally
from
the
same
stock
as
the
northmen
and
saxons
conquered
the
island
they
grafted
onto
the
civilization
which
they
found
there
certain
elements
of
continental
civilization
eventually
the
saxon
yeoman
and
the
norman
knight
joined
hands
and
fortunes
and
became
one
people
this
union
was
first
unmistakable
recognized
in
the
provisions
of
magna
carta
when
in
the
barons
forced
king
john
to
grant
that
memorable
document
they
found
it
expedient
to
protect
the
rights
of
every
class
of
the
population
then
nobles
clergy
farmers
townsmen
and
laborers
whether
bond
or
free
stood
as
it
were
shoulder
to
shoulder
the
rise
of
free
towns
marked
another
long
step
forward
that
movement
secured
to
their
inhabitants
many
precious
privileges
of
then
the
wat
tyler
insurrection
of
a
subsequent
period
led
gradually
to
the
emancipation
of
that
numerous
class
which
had
long
been
in
partial
bondage
meanwhile
the
real
unity
of
the
people
clearly
showed
itself
at
the
time
when
the
crown
began
to
tax
the
poor
as
well
as
the
rich
the
moment
the
king
laid
hands
on
the
tradesman
and
the
pockets
they
demanded
to
have
their
share
in
making
the
laws
out
of
that
demand
made
in
rose
the
house
of
commons
it
was
a
body
as
its
name
implies
composed
of
representatives
chosen
mainly
from
the
people
and
by
the
people
next
after
generations
of
arduous
struggle
followed
by
the
grant
of
the
petition
of
right
and
then
by
the
great
civil
war
it
was
finally
settled
that
the
house
of
commons
and
the
house
of
commons
alone
had
complete
power
over
the
purse
from
that
time
the
king
knew
once
for
all
that
he
could
not
take
the
people
money
unless
it
was
granted
by
the
people
vote
after
the
flight
of
james
ii
parliament
passed
the
bill
of
rights
in
and
in
the
act
of
settlement
these
two
revolutionary
measures
wrought
a
radical
change
in
the
government
of
england
they
deliberately
set
aside
the
old
order
of
hereditary
royal
succession
and
established
a
new
order
which
made
the
king
directly
dependent
on
the
people
for
his
title
and
his
power
to
rule
about
the
same
time
parliament
passed
the
toleration
act
which
granted
a
larger
degree
of
religious
liberty
and
in
the
house
of
commons
took
action
which
secured
the
freedom
of
the
press
less
than
thirty
years
afterwards
another
radical
change
took
place
hitherto
the
king
had
appointed
his
own
private
council
or
cabinet
but
when
george
i
came
to
the
htrone
from
germany
he
could
speak
no
english
one
of
the
members
of
the
cabinet
became
prime
minister
in
and
the
king
left
the
management
of
the
government
to
him
and
his
assoaciates
two
generations
later
another
great
change
occurred
watt
invention
of
a
really
practical
steam
engine
in
together
with
the
rapid
growth
of
manufacturing
towns
in
the
midlands
and
the
north
of
england
brought
on
an
industrial
revolution
a
factory
population
grew
up
which
found
itself
without
any
representation
in
parliament
the
people
of
that
section
demanded
that
this
serious
inequality
be
righted
their
persistent
efforts
compelled
the
passage
of
the
great
reform
bill
of
that
measure
broke
up
the
political
monopoly
hitherto
enjoyed
in
large
degree
by
the
landholders
and
distributed
much
of
the
power
among
the
middle
classes
the
next
important
change
took
place
at
the
accession
of
victoria
the
principle
was
then
finally
established
that
the
ruling
power
of
the
government
does
not
center
in
the
crown
but
in
the
cabinet
furthermore
it
was
settled
that
the
prime
minister
and
his
cabinet
are
responsible
solely
to
the
house
of
commons
which
in
its
turn
is
responsible
only
to
the
expressed
will
of
the
majority
of
the
nation
in
the
course
of
the
next
half
century
the
reform

extended
the
suffrage
to
the
great

of
the

a
little
more
than
twenty
years
later
in
the
combined
liberal
and
labor
parties
gained
an
overwhelming
victory
at
the
polls
this
secured
the
workingmen
seats
in
parliament
whereas
up
to
that
time
they
had
never
had
more
than
three
or
four
it
then
became
evident
that
a
new
power
had
entered
the
house
of
commons
from
that
date
the
nation
has
fully
realized
that
although
england
is
a
monarchy
in
name
yet
it
is
a
republic
in
fact
the
slow
progress
of
time
has
at
length
given
to
the
british
people
english
scotch
welsh
and
irish
the
great
gift
of
practical
liberty
but
along
with
it
it
has
imposed
that
political
responsibility
which
is
always
the
price
which
must
be
paid
for
the
maintenance
of
liberty

conclusion
this
rapid
and
imperfect
sketch
shows
what
has
been
accomplished
by
the
people
of
britain
other
european
peoples
may
have
developed
earlier
and
made
perhaps
more
rapid
advances
in
certain
forms
of
civilization
but
none
have
surpassed
nay
none
have
equaled
the
race
in
the
practical
characer
and
permanence
of
its
progress
guizot
says
that
the
true
order
of
national
development
in
free
government
is
first
to
convert
the
natural
liberties
of
man
into
clearly
defined
political
rights
and
next
to
guarantee
the
security
of
those
rights
by
the
establishment
of
forces
capable
of
maintaining
them

nowhere
do
we
find
better
illustrations
of
this
truth
than
in
the
history
of
england
and
of
the
colonies
which
england
has
planted
for
the
fact
can
not
be
too
strongly
emphasized
that
european
history
england
stands
as
the
leader
in
the
development
of
constitutional
trial
by
jury
the
legal
right
to
resist
oppression
legislative
representation
religious
freedom
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
finally
the
principle
that
all
political
power
is
a
trust
held
for
the
public
good
these
are
the
assured
results
of
growth
and
the
legitimate
heritage
of
every
nation
of
descent
macaulay
essay
on
sir
robert
walpole
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
best
men
and
the
best
minds
in
england
without
distinction
of
rank
or
class
are
now
laboring
for
the
advancement
of
the
people
they
see
what
has
never
been
so
clearly
seen
before
that
the
nation
is
a
unit
that
the
welfare
of
each
depends
ultimately
on
the
welfare
of
all
and
that
the
higher
a
man
stands
and
the
greater
his
wealth
and
privileges
so
much
the
more
is
he
bound
to
extend
a
helping
hand
to
those
less
favored
than
himself
the
socialists
it
is
true
demand
the
abolition
of
private
property
in
land
and
the
nationalizing
not
only
of
the
soil
but
of
all
mines
railways
waterworks
and
docks
in
the
kingdom
thus
far
however
they
have
shown
no
disposition
to
attain
their
objects
by
violent
action
england
by
nature
conservative
is
slow
to
break
the
bond
of
historic
continuity
which
connects
her
present
with
her
past
do
you
think
we
shall
ever
have
a
second
revolution
the
duke
of
wellington
was
once
asked
we
may
answered
the
great
general
but
if
we
do
it
will
come
by
act
of
parliament
that
reply
probably
expresses
the
general
temper
of
the
people
who
believe
that
they
can
gain
by
the
ballot
more
than
they
can
by
an
appeal
to
force
knowing
that
theirs
is
a
land
of
settled
government
a
land
of
just
and
old
renown
where
freedom
broadens
slowly
down
from
precedent
to
precedent
tennyson
you
ask
me
why
it
is
impossible
for
the
great
majority
of
americans
not
to
take
a
deep
interest
in
this
movement
for
we
can
never
forget
that
english
history
is
in
a
very
large
degree
our
history
and
that
england
is
as
hawthorne
likes
to
call
it
our
old
home
in
fact
if
we
go
back
less
than
three
centuries
the
record
of
america
becomes
one
with
that
of
the
mother
country
which
first
discovered
and
first
permanently
settled
this
and
which
gave
us
for
leaders
and
educators
washington
franklin
the
adamses
and
john
harvard
in
descent
by
far
the
greater
part
of
us
are
of
english
blood
or
of
blood
akin
to
it
we
owe
to
england
that
is
to
the
british
isles
and
to
the
different
races
which
have
met
and
mingled
there
much
of
our
language
literature
law
legislative
forms
of
government
and
the
essential
features
of
our
civilization
in
fact
without
a
knowledge
of
her
history
we
can
not
rightly
understand
our
own
in
the
population
of
the
united
states
in
round
numbers
was
of
whom
the
greater
part
were
probably
of
english
descent
since
then
there
has
been
an
enormous
immigration
per
cent
of
which
were
from
the
british
isles
but
it
is
perhaps
safe
to
say
that
three
quarters
of
our
present
population
are
those
were
were
living
here
in
with
their
descendents
of
the
immigrants
up
to
coming
from
races
the
germans
and
scandinavians
predominated
and
it
is
to
them
as
we
have
seen
that
the
english
in
large
measure
owe
their
origin
it
should
be
noted
here
that
the
word
english
is
used
so
as
to
include
the
people
of
the
united
kingdom
and
their
descendants
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
standing
on
her
soil
we
possess
practically
the
same
personal
rights
that
we
do
in
america
we
speak
the
same
tongue
we
meet
with
the
same
familiar
names
we
feel
that
whatever
is
glorious
in
her
past
is
ours
also
that
westminster
abbey
belongs
as
much
to
us
as
to
her
for
our
ancestors
helped
to
build
its
walls
and
their
dust
is
gathered
in
its
tombs
that
shakespeare
and
milton
belong
to
us
in
like
manner
for
they
wrote
in
the
language
we
speak
for
the
instruction
and
delight
of
our
fathers
fathers
who
beat
back
the
spanish
armada
and
gave
their
lives
for
liberty
on
the
fields
of
marston
moor
and
naseby
let
it
be
granted
that
grave
issues
have
arisen
in
the
past
to
separate
us
yet
after
all
our
interests
and
our
sympathies
like
our
national
histories
have
more
in
common
than
they
have
apart
the
progress
of
each
country
now
reacts
for
good
on
the
other
in
this
connection
the
testimony
of
captain
alfred
mahan
in
his
recent
work
the
problem
of
asia
is
worth
quoting
here
he
says
speaking
of
our
late
war
with
spain
the
writer
has
been
assured
by
an
authority
in
which
he
entirely
trusts
that
to
a
proposition
made
to
great
britain
to
enter
into
a
combination
to
constrain
the
use
of
our
united
states
power
as
japan
was
five
years
ago
constrained
by
the
joint
action
of
russia
france
and
germany
the
reply
of
great
britain
was
not
only
a
positive
refusal
to
enter
into
such
a
combination
against
the
united
states
but
an
assurance
of
active
resistance
to
it
if
attempted
call
such
an
attitude
on
the
part
of
england
toward
the
united
states
friendship
or
policy
as
you
will
the
name
is
immaterial
the
fact
is
the
essential
thing
and
will
endure
because
it
rests
upon
solid
interest
if
we
consider
the
total
combined
population
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
british
empire
we
find
that
upwards
of
people
speak
the
english
tongue
and
are
governed
by
the
fundamental
principles
of
that
common
law
which
has
its
root
in
english
soil
this
population
holds
possession
of
more
than
square
miles
of
the
earth
surface
an
area
much
larger
than
that
of
the
united
continents
of
north
america
and
europe
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
globe
is
theirs
they
have
expanded
by
their
territorial
and
colonial
growth
as
no
other
people
have
they
have
absorbed
and
assimilated
the
multitudes
of
emigrants
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
that
have
poured
into
their
dominions
the
result
is
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
british
isles
of
australia
of
new
zealand
of
a
part
of
south
africa
of
the
united
states
and
of
canada
practically
form
one
great
race
diverse
in
origin
separated
by
distance
but
everywhere
exhibiting
the
same
spirit
of
intelligent
enterprise
and
of
steady
resistless
growth
thus
considered
america
and
england
are
necessary
one
to
the
other
their
interests
now
and
in
the
future
are
essentially
the
same
bothe
contries
are
virtually
pledged
to
make
every
effort
to
maintain
liberty
and
and
also
to
maintain
mutual
peace
by
arbitration
such
apparent
exceptions
as
the
dutch
in
south
africa
the
french
in
canada
and
the
negroes
in
the
united
states
do
not
essentially
affect
the
truth
of
this
statement
since
in
practice
the
people
of
these
races
uphold
the
great
fundamental
principles
on
which
all
government
rests
in
view
of
these
facts
let
us
say
with
an
eminent
thinker
whose
intellectual
home
was
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
whatever
there
be
between
the
two
nations
to
forget
and
forgive
is
forgotten
and
forgiven
if
the
two
peoples
which
are
one
be
true
to
their
duty
who
can
doubt
that
the
destinies
of
the
world
must
be
in
large
measure
committed
to
their
hands

the
main
body
of
the
english
people
did
not
originate
in
britain
but
in
northwestern
germany
the
jutes
saxons
and
angles
were
independent
kindred
tribes
living
on
the
banks
of
the
elbe
and
its
vicinity
they
had
no
written
laws
but
obeyed
customs
which
had
all
the
force
of
laws
all
matters
of
public
importance
were
decided
by
each
tribe
at
meetings
held
in
the
open

there
every
freeman
had
an
equal
voice
in
the

there
the

chose
their
rulers
and
military
leaders
they
discussed
questions
of
peace
and

finally
acting
as
a
high
court
of
justice
they
tried
criminals
and
settled
disputes
about
property
in
these
rude
methods
we
see
the
beginning
of
the
english
constitution
its
growth
has
been
the
slow
work
of
centuries
but
the
great
principles
underlying
it
have
never
changed
at
every
stage
of
their
progress
the
english
people
and
their
descendants
throughout
the
globe
have
claimed
the
right
of
and
if
we
except
the
period
of
the
norman
conquest
whenever
that
right
has
been
persistently
withheld
or
denied
the
people
have
risen
in
arms
and
regained
it
conquest
of
britain
origin
and
power
of
the
king
after
the
romans
abandoned
britain
the
english
invaded
the
island
and
in
the
course
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
conquered
it
and
established
a
number
of
rival
settlements
the
native
britons
were
in
great
part
killed
off
or
driven
to
take
refuge
in
wales
and
cornwall
the
conquerors
brought
to
their
new
home
the
methods
of
government
and
modes
of
life
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
in
germany
a
cluster
of
towns
that
is
a
small
number
of
enclosed
habitations
formed
a
hundred
a
district
having
either
a
hundred
families
or
able
to
furnish
a
hundred
warriors
a
cluster
of
hundreds
formed
a
shire
or
county
each
of
these
divisions
had
its
public
meeting
composed
of
all
its
freemen
or
their
representatives
for
the
management
of
its
own
affairs
but
a
state
of
war
for
the
english
tribes
fought
each
other
as
well
as
fought
the
britons
made
a
strong
central
government
necessary
for
this
reason
the
leader
of
each
tribe
was
made
king
at
first
he
was
chosen
at
large
by
the
entire
tribe
later
unless
there
was
some
good
reason
for
a
different
choice
the
king
eldest
son
was
selected
as
his
successor
thus
the
right
to
rule
was
practically
fixed
in
the
line
of
a
certain
family
descent
the
ruler
of
each
of
these
petty
kingdoms
acted
as
in
war
and
as
supreme
judge
in
law
the
witenagemot
or
general
council
in
all
other
respects
the
king
authority
was
limited
except
when
he
was
strong
enough
to
get
his
own
way
by
the
witenagemot
or
general
council
this
body
consisted
of
the
chief
men
of
each
kingdom
acting
in
behalf
of
its
people
it
exercised
the
following
powers
it
elected
the
king
and
if
the
people
confirmed
the
choice
he
was
crowned
if
the
king
proved
unsatisfactory
the
council
might
depose
him
and
choose
a
successor
the
king
with
the
consent
of
the
council
made
the
laws
that
is
he
declared
the
customs
of
the
tribe
the
king
with
the
council
appointed
the
chief
officers
of
the
kingdom
after
the
introduction
of
christianity
this
included
the
bishops
but
the
king
alone
appointed
the
sheriff
to
represent
him
and
collect
the
revenue
in
each
shire
the
council
confirmed
or
denied
grants
of
portions
of
the
public
lands
made
by
the
king
to
private
persons
the
council
acted
as
the
high
court
of
justice
the
king
sitting
as
supreme
judge
the
council
with
the
king
discussed
all
questions
of
importance
such
as
the
levying
of
taxes
and
the
making
of
treaties
smaller
matters
were
left
to
the
towns
hundreds
and
shires
to
settle
for
themselves
after
the
consolidation
of
the
different
english
kingdoms
into
one
the
witenagemot
expanded
into
the
national
council
in
it
we
see
the
true
beginning
of
the
parliament
of
england
the
witenagmot
the
meeting
of
the
witan
or
wise
men
says
stubbs
select
charters
represented
the

although
it
was
not
a
collection
of
representatives
how
england
became
a
united
kingdom
influence
of
the
church
and
of
the
danish
invasions
for
a
number
of
centuries
britain
consisted
of
a
number
of
little
rival
kingdoms
almost
constantly
at
war
with
each
other
meanwhile
missionaries
from
rome
had
introduced
christianity
through
the
influence
of
theodore
of
tarsus
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
clergy
of
the
different
hostile
kingdoms
met
in
general
church
councils
this
religious
unity
of
action
prepared
the
way
for
political
unity
the
catholic
church
the
only
christian
church
except
the
greek
church
then
existing
made
men
feel
that
their
highest
interests
were
one
it
created
the
nation
this
movement
began
several
years
earlier
but
theodore
of
tarsus
was
its
first
great
organizer
this
was
the
first
cause
of
the
union
of
the
kingdoms
the
second
was
the
invasion
of
the
danes
these
fierce
marauders
forced
the
people
south
of
the
thames
to
join
in
common
defense
under
the
leadership
of
alfred
king
of
the
west
saxons
by
the
treaty
of
wedmore
the
danes
were
compelled
to
give
up
southwestern
england
but
they
retained
the
whole
of
the
northeast
about
the
middle
of
the
tenth
century
one
of
alfred
grandsons
conquered
the
dnaes
and
took
the
title
of
king
of
england
later
the
danes
reenforced
by
fresh
invasions
of
their
countrymen
made
themselves
masters
of
the
land
yet
canute
the
most
powerful
of
these
danish
kings
ruled
according
to
english
methods
at
length
the
great
body
of
the
people
united
in
choosing
edward
the
confessor
king
he
was
english
by
birth
but
norman
by
education
under
him
the
unity
of
the

was
in

at

fully

beginning
of
the
feudal
system
its
results
meantime
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
england
with
respect
to
holding
land
we
shall
see
clearly
to
what
that
change
was
tending
if
we
look
at
the
condition
of
france
there
a
system
of
government
and
of
land
tenure
existed
known
as
the
feudal
system
under
it
the
king
was
regarded
as
the
owner
of
the
entire
realm
he
granted
with
his
royal
protection
the
use
of
portions
of
the
land
to
his
chief
men
or
nobles
with
the
privilege
of
building
castles
and
of
establishing
courts
of
justice
on
these
estates
such
grants
were
made
on
two
conditions
that
the
tenants
should
take
part
in
the
king
council
that
they
should
do
military
service
in
the
behalf
and
furnish
besides
a
certain
number
of
fully
armed
horsemen
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
land
they
had
received
so
long
as
they
fulfilled
these
conditionms
made
under
oath
they
could
retain
their
estates
and
hand
them
down
to
their
children
but
if
they
failed
to
keep
their
oath
they
forfeited
the
land
to
the
king
these
great
military
barons
or
lords
let
out
parts
of
their
immense
manors
or
estates
on
similar
conditions
namely
that
their
vassals
or
tenants
should
pay
rent
to
them
by
doing
military
or
other
service
and
that
they
should
agree
that
all
questions
concerning
their
rights
and
duties
should
be
tried
in
the
lord
private
court
on
the
other
hand
the
lord
of
the
manor
pledged
himself
to
protect
his
vassals
manor
see
plan
of
a
manor
old
french
manoir
a
mansion
on
page
the
estate
of
a
feudal
lord
every
manor
had
two
courts
the
most
important
of
these
was
the
court
baron
it
was
composed
of
all
the
free
tenants
of
the
manor
with
the
lord
or
his
representative
presiding
it
dealt
with
civil
cases
only
the
second
court
was
the
court
customary
which
dealt
with
cases
connected
with
villeinage
the
manors
held
by
the
greater
barons
had
a
third
court
the
court
leet
which
dealt
with
criminal
cases
and
could
inflict
the
death
penalty
in
all
cases
the
decisions
of
the
manorial
courts
would
be
pretty
sure
to
be
in
the
lord
favor
in
england
however
these
courts
never
acquired
the
degree
of
power
which
they
did
on
the
continent
see
note
above
on
the
manor
on
every
manor
there
were
usually
three
classes
of
these
tenants
those
who
discharged
their
rent
by
doing
military
duty
those
who
paid
by
a
certain
fixed
amount
of
labor
or
if
they
preferred
in
produce
or
in
money
the
villeins
or
common
laborers
who
were
bound
to
remain
on
the
estate
and
work
for
the
lord
and
whose
condition
although
they
were
not
wholly
destitute
of
legal
rights
was
practically
not
very
much
above
that
of
slaves
but
there
was
another
way
by
which
men
might
enter
the
feudal
system
for
while
it
was
growing
up
there
were
many
small
free
landholders
who
owned
their
farms
and
owed
no
man
any
service
whatever
in
those
times
of
constant
civil
war
such
men
would
be
almost
in
daily
peril
of
losing
not
only
their
property
but
their
lives
to
escape
this
danger
they
would
hasten
to
commend
themselves
to
some
powerful
neighboring
lord
to
do
this
they
pledged
themselves
to
become
his
men
surrendering
their
farms
to
him
and
received
them
again
as
feudal
vassals
that
is
the
lord
bound
himself
to
protect
them
against
their
enemies
and
they
bound
themselves
to
do
suit
and
service
like
the
other
tenants
of
the
manor
for
suit
and
service
on
the
one
side
and
protection
on
the
other
made
up
the
threefold
foundation
of
the
feudal
system
that
is
they
pledged
themselves
to
do
suit
in
the
lord
private
court
and
to
do
service
in
his
army
thus
in
time
all
classes
of
society
became
bound
together
at
the
top
stood
the
king
who
was
no
man
tenant
but
in
name
at
least
every
man
master
at
the
bottom
crouched
the
villein
who
was
no
master
but
was
in
fact
the
most
servile
and
helpless
of
tenants
such
was
the
condition
of
things
in
france
in
england
however
this
system
of
land
tenure
was
not
completely
established
until
after
the
norman
conquest
for
in
england
the
tie
which
bound
men
to
the
king
and
to
each
other
was
originally
one
of
pure
choice
and
had
nothing
directly
to
do
with
land
gradually
however
this
changed
and
by
the
time
of
edward
the
confessor
land
in
england
had
come
to
be
held
on
conditions
so
closely
resembling
those
of
france
that
one
step
more
and
that
a
very
short
one
would
have
made
england
a
kingdom
exhibiting
all
the
most
dangerous
features
of
french
feudalism
for
notwithstanding
certain
advantages
feudalism
had
this
great
evil
that
the
chief
nobles
often
became
in
time
more
powerful
than
the
king
this
danger
now
menaced
england
for
convenience
canute
the
dane
had
divided
the
realm
into
four
earldoms
the
holders
of
these
vast
estates
had
grown
so
mighty
that
they
scorned
royal
authority
edward
the
confessor
did
not
dare
resist
them
the
ambition
of
each
earl
was
to
get
the
supreme
mastery
this
threatened
to
bring
on
civil
war
and
to
split
the
kingdom
into
fragments
fortunately
for
the
welfare
of
the
nation
william
duke
of
normandy
by
his
invasion
and
conquest
of
england
put
an
effectual
stop
to
the
selfish
schemes
of
these
four
rival
nobles
on
the
advantages
of
feudalism
see
william
the
conqueror
and
his
work
after
william
victory
at
hastings
and
march
on
london
the
national
council
chose
him
sovereign
they
would
not
have
dared
to
refuse
and
he
was
crowned
by
the
archbishop
of
york
in
westminster
abbey
this
coronation
made
him
the
legal
successor
of
the
line
of
english
kings
in
form
therefore
there
was
no
break
in
the
order
of
government
for
though
william
had
forced
himself
upon
the
throne
he
had
done
so
according
to
law
and
custom
and
not
directly
by
the
sword
great
changed
followed
the
conquest
but
they
were
not
violent
the
king
abolished
the
four
great
earldoms
and
restored
national
unity
he
gradually
dispossessed
the
chief
english
landholders
of
their
lands
and
bestowed
them
under
strict
feudal
laws
on
his
norman
followers
he
likewise
gave
all
the
highest
positions
in
the
church
to
norman
bishops
and
abbots
the
national
council
now
changed
its
character
it
became
simply
a
body
of
norman
barons
who
were
bound
by
feudal
custom
to
meet
with
the
king
but
they
did
not
restrain
his
authority
for
william
would
brook
no
interference
with
his
will
from
any
one
not
even
from
the
pope
himself
but
though
the
conqueror
had
a
tyrant
power
he
rarely
used
it
like
a
tyrant
we
have
seen
that
the
great
excellence
of
the
early
english
government
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
towns
hundreds
and
shires
were
in
all
local
matters
the
drawback
to
this
system
was
its
lack
of
unity
and
of
a
strong
central
power
that
could
make
itself
respected
and
obeyed
william
supplied
this
power
without
which
there
could
be
no
true
national
strength
yet
at
the
same
time
he
was
careful
to
encourage
the
local
system
of
government
he
gave
london
a
liberal
charter
to
protect
its
rights
and
liberties
he
began
the
organization
of
a
royal
court
of
justice
he
checked
the
rapacious
norman
barons
in
their
efforts
to
get
control
of
the
people
courts
see
of
this
summary
furthermore
side
by
side
with
the
feudal
cavalry
army
he
maintained
the
old
english
county
militia
of
foot
soldiers
in
which
every
freeman
was
bound
to
serve
he
used
this
militia
when
necessary
to
prevent
the
barons
from
getting
the
upper
hand
and
so
destroying
those
liberties
which
were
protected
by
the
crown
as
its
own
best
safeguard
against
the
plots
of
the
nobles
next
william
had
a
census
survey
and
valuation
made
of
all
the
estates
in
the
kingdom
outside
london
which
were
worth
examination
the
result
of
this
great
work
was
recorded
in
domesday
book
by
means
of
that
book
still
preserved
the
king
knew
what
no
english
ruler
had
known
before
him
that
was
the
population
and
resources
of
the
kingdom
thus
a
solid
foundation
was
laid
on
which
to
establish
the
feudal
revenue
and
the
military
power
of
the
crown
finally
just
before
his
death
the
conqueror
completed
the
organization
of
his
government
hitherto
the
vassals
of
the
great
barons
had
been
bound
to
them
alone
they
were
sworn
to
fight
for
their
masters
even
if
those
masters
rose
in
open
rebellion
against
the
sovereign
william
changed
all
that
at
a
meeting
held
at
salisbury
he
compelled
every
landholder
in
england
from
the
greatest
to
the
smallest
sixty
thousand
it
is
said
to
swear
to
be
faithful
to
him
against
all
others
by
that
oath
he
broke
the
neck
of
the
feudal
system
as
a
form
of
government
though
he
retained
and
developed
the
principle
of
feudal
land
tenure
thus
at
one
stroke
he
made
the
crown
the
supreme
power
in
england
had
he
not
done
so
the
nation
would
soon
have
fallen
prey
to
civil
war
william
norman
successors
william
rufus
has
a
bad
name
in
history
and
he
fully
deserves
it
but
he
had
this
merit
he
held
the
norman
barons
in
check
with
a
stiff
hand
and
so
in
one
way
gave
the
country
comparative
peace
his
successor
henry
i
granted
a
charter
of
liberties
note
to
his
people
by
which
he
recognized
the
sacredness
of
the
old
english
laws
for
the
protection
of
life
and
property
somewhat
more
than
a
century
later
this
document
became
as
we
shall
see
the
basis
of
the
most
celebrated
charter
known
in
english
history
henry
attempted
important
reforms
in
the
administration
of
the
laws
and
laid
the
foundation
of
that
system
which
his
grandson
henry
ii
was
to
develop
and
establish
by
these
measures
he
gained
the
title
of
the
lion
of
justice
who
made
peace
for
both
man
and
beast
furthermore
in
an
important
controversy
with
the
pope
respecting
the
appointment
of
bishops
henry
obtained
the
right
to
require
that
both
bishops
and
abbots
after
taking
possession
of
their
church
estates
should
be
obliged
like
the
baron
to
furnish
troops
for
the
defense
of
the
kingdom
but
in
the
next
reign
that
of
stephen
the
barons
got
the
upper
hand
and
the
king
was
powerless
to
control
them
they
built
castles
without
royal
license
and
from
these
private
fortresses
they
sallied
forth
to
ravage
rob
and
murder
in
all
directions
had
that
period
of
terror
continued
much
longer
england
would
have
been
torn
to
pieces
by
a
multitude
of
greedy
tyrants
reforms
of
henry
ii

with
henry
ii
the
true
reign
of
law
begins
to
carry
out
the
reforms
begun
by
his
grandfather
henry
i
the
king
fought
both
barons
and
clergy
over
the
first
he
won
a
complete
and
final
victory
over
the
second
he
gained
a
partial
one
henry
began
his
work
by
pulling
down
the
unlicensed
castles
built
by
the
robber
barons
in
stephen
reign
but
according
to
feudal
usage
the
king
was
dependent
on
these
very
barons
for
his
cavalry
his
chief
armed
force
he
resolved
to
make
himself
independent
of
their
reluctant
aid
to
do
this
he
offered
to
release
them
from
military
service
provided
they
would
pay
a
tax
called
scutage
or
shield
money
the
barons
gladly
accepted
the
offer
with
the
money
henry
was
able
to
hire
mercenaries
or
foreign
troops
to
fight
for
him
abroad
and
if
need
be
in
england
as
well
thus
he
struck
a
great
blow
at
the
power
of
the
barons
since
they
through
disuse
of
arms
grew
weaker
while
the
king
grew
steadily
stronger
to
complete
the
work
henry
many
years
later
reorganized
the
old
english
national
militia
and
made
it
thoroughly
effective
for
the
defense
of
the
royal
authority
for
just
a
hundred
years
the
barons
had
been
trying
to
overthrow
the
government
under
henry
ii
the
long
struggle
came
to
an
end
and
the
royal
power
triumphed
scutage
see
the
demand
for
scutage
seems
to
show
that
the
feudal
tenure
was
now
fully
organized
and
that
the
whole
realm
was
by
this
time
divided
into
knights
fees
that
is
into
portions
of
land
yielding
pounds
annually
each
of
which
was
obliged
to
furnish
one
fully
armed
knight
to
serve
the
king
if
called
on
for
forty
days
annually
national
militia
see
but
in
getting
the
military
control
of
the
kingdom
henry
had
won
only
half
of
the
victory
he
was
seeking
to
complete
his
supremacy
over
the
powerful
nobles
the
king
must
obtain
control
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
order
to
do
this
more
effectually
henry
issued
the
assize
of
clarendon
it
was
the
first
true
national
code
of
law
ever
put
forth
by
an
english
king
since
previous
codes
had
been
little
more
than
summaries
of
old
customs
the
realm
had
already
been
divided
into
six
circuits
having
three
judges
for
each
circuit
the
assize
of
clarendon
gave
these
judges
power
not
only
to
enter
and
preside
over
every
county
court
but
also
over
every
court
held
by
a
baron
on
his
manor
this
put
a
pretty
decisive
check
to
the
hitherto
uncontrolled
baronial
system
of
justice
or
injustice
with
its
private
dungeons
and
its
private
gibbets
it
brought
everything
under
the
eye
of
the
king
judges
so
that
those
who
wished
to
appeal
to
them
could
now
do
so
without
the
expense
trouble
and
danger
of
a
journey
to
the
royal
palace
again
it
had
been
the
practice
among
the
norman
barons
to
settle
disputes
about
land
by
the
barbarous
method
of
trial
by
battle
henry
gave
tenants
the
right
to
have
the
case
decided
by
a
body
of
twelve
knights
acquainted
with
the
facts
in
criminal
cases
a
great
change
was
likewise
effected
henceforth
twelve
men
from
each
hundred
with
four
from
each
township
sixteen
at
least
acting
as
a
grand
jury
were
to
present
all
suspected
criminals
to
the
circuit
judges
the
judges
sent
them
to
the
ordeal
if
they
failed
to
pass
it
they
were
then
punished
by
law
as
convicted
felons
if
they
did
pass
it
they
were
banished
from
the
kingdom
as
persons
of
evil
repute
after
the
abolition
of
the
ordeal
a
petty
jury
of
witnesses
was
allowed
to
testify
in
favor
of
the
accused
and
clear
them
if
they
could
from
the
charges
brought
by
the
grand
jury
if
their
testimony
was
not
decisive
more
witnesses
were
added
until
twelve
were
obtained
who
could
unanimously
decide
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
course
of
time
this
smaller
body
became
judges
of
the
evidence
for
or
against
the
accused
and
thus
the
modern
system
of
trial
by
jury
was
established
about
see
the
assize
of
clarendon
in
stubbs
select
charters
the
date
usually
given
is
but
as
late
as
the
reign
of
george
i
juries
were
accustomed
to
bring
in
verdicts
determined
partly
by
their
own
personal
knowledge
of
the
facts
see
revised
edition
these
reforms
had
three
important
results
they
greatly
dimished
the
power
of
the
barons
by
taking
the
administration
of
justice
in
large
measure
out
of
their
hands
they
established
a
more
uniform
system
of
law
they
brought
large
sums
of
money
in
the
way
of
court
fees
and
fines
into
the
king
treasury
and
so
made
him
stronger
than
ever
but
meanwhile
henry
was
carrying
on
a
still
sharper
battle
in
his
attempt
to
bring
the
church
courts
which
william
i
had
separated
from
the
ordinary
courts
under
control
of
the
same
system
of
justice
in
these
church
courts
any
person
claiming
to
belong
to
the
clergy
had
a
right
to
be
tried
such
courts
had
no
power
to
inflict
death
even
for
murder
in
stephen
reign
many
notorious
criminals
had
managed
to
get
themselves
enrolled
among
the
clergy
and
had
thus
escaped
the
hanging
they
deserved
henry
was
determined
to
have
all
men
in
the
circle
of
clergy
or
out
of
it
stand
equal
before
the
law
instead
of
two
kinds
of
justice
he
would
have
but
one
this
would
not
only
secure
a
still
higher
uniformity
of
law
but
it
would
sweep
into
the
king
treasury
may
fat
fees
and
fines
which
the
church
courts
were
then
getting
for
themselves
by
the
laws
entitled
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
the
common
courts
were
empowered
to
decide
whether
a
man
claiming
to
belong
to
the
clergy
should
be
tried
by
the
church
courts
or
not
if
they
granted
him
the
privilege
of
a
trial
they
kept
a
sharp
watch
on
the
progress
of
the
case
if
the
accused
was
convicted
he
must
then
be
handed
over
to
the
judges
of
the
ordinary
courts
and
they
took
especial
pains
to
convince
him
of
the
bible
truth
that
the
way
of
the
transgressor
is
hard
for
a
time
the
constitutions
were
rigidly
enforced
but
in
the
end
henry
was
forced
to
renounce
them
later
however
the
principle
he
had
endeavored
to
set
up
was
fully
established
edward
i
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
the
church
courts
to
purely
spiritual
cases
such
as
heresy
and
the
like
but
the
work
which
he
following
the
example
of
henry
ii
had
undertaken
was
not
fully
accomplished
until
the
fifteenth
century
the
greatest
result
springing
from
henry
efforts
was
the
training
of
the
people
in
public
affairs
and
the
definitive
establishment
of
that
system
of
common
law
which
regards
the
people
as
the
supreme
source
of
both
law
and
government
and
which
is
directly
and
vitally
connected
with
the
principle
of
representation
and
of
trial

but
as
these
towns
occupied
land
belonging
either
directly
to

to

they
were

to

been
gradually
mingling
from
this
time

became
practically

cruelty
brought
their
union
into
sharp
decisive
action
the
result
of
his
greed
for
money
and
his
defiance
of
all
law
was
a
tremendous
insurrection
before
this
time
the
people
had
always
taken
the
side
of
the
king
against
the
barons
now
with
equal
reason
they
turned
about
and
rose
with
the
barons
against
the
king
under
the
guidance
of
archbishop
langton
barons
clergy
and
people
demanded
reform
the
archbishop
brought
out
the
charter
of

this
now
furnished
a
model
for
magna
carta
or
the
great
charter
of
the
liberties
of
england
magna
carta
see
and
see
constitutional
documents
it
contained
nothing
that
was
new
in
principle
it
was
simply
a
clearer
fuller
stronger
statement
of
those
rights
of
englishmen
which
were
already
old
john
though
wild
with
rage
did
not
dare
refuse
to
affix
his
royal
seal
to
the
great
charter
of

doing
so
he
solemnly
guaranteed
the
rights
of
the
church
those
of
the
barons
those
of
all
freemen
those
of
the
villeins
or
farm
laborers
the
value
of
this
charter
to
the
people
at
large
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
nearly
one
third
of
its
articles
were
inserted
in
their
behhalf
of
these
articles
the
most
important
was
that
which
declared
that
no
man
should
be
deprived
of
liberty
or
property
or
injured
in
body
or
estate
save
by
the
judgment
of
his
equals
or
by
the
law
of
the
land
in
regard
to
taxation
the
charter
provided
that
except
the
customary
feudal
aids
none
should
be
levied
unless
by
the
consent
of
the
national
council
finally
the
charter
expressly
provided
that
barons
one

whom
was

should
be

note

on
the
other
hand
henry
was
obliged
to
issue
a
forest

based
on
certain
articles
of
magna
carta
which
declared
that
no
man
should
lose
life
or
limb
for
hunting
in
the
royal
forests
though
the
great
charter
was
now
shorn
of
some
of
its
safeguards
to
liberty
yet
it
was
still
so
highly
prized
that
its
confirmation
was
purchased
at
a
high
price
from
successive
sovereigns
down
to
the
second
year
of
henry
vi
reign
we
find
that
it
had
been
confirmed
no
less
than
times
notwithstanding
his
solemn
oath
the
vain
and
worthless
henry
iii
deliberately
violated
the
provisions
of
the
charter
in
order
to
raise
money
to
waste
in
his
foolish
foreign
wars
or
on
his
court
circle
of
french
favorites
finally
a
body
of
armed
barons
led
by
simon
de
montfort
earl
of
leicester
forced
the
king
to
summon
a
parliament
at
oxford
there
a
scheme
of
reform
called
the
provisions
of
oxford
was
adopted
by
these
provisions
which
henry
swore
to
observe
the
government
was
practically
taken
out
of
the
king
hands
at
least
as
far
as
he
had
power
to
do
mischief
and
entrusted
to
certain
councils
or
committees
of
state
a
few
years
later
henry
refused
to
abide
by
the
provisions
of
oxford
and
civil
war
broke
out
de
montfort
earl
of
leicester
gained
a
decisive
victory
at
lewes
and
captured
the
king
the
earl
then
summoned
a
national
council
made
up
of
those
who
favored
his
policy
of
reform
this
was
the
famous
parliamnet
of
to
it
de
montfort
summoned
a
small
number
of
barons
a
large
number
of
the
higher
clergy
two
knights
or
country
gentlemen
from
each
shire
two
burghers
or
citizens
from
every
town
the
knights
of
the
shire
had
been
summoned
to
parliamnet
before
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
towns
had
been
invited
to
send
representatives
by
that
act
the
earl
set
the
example
of
giving
the
people
at
large
a
fuller
share
in
the
government
than
they
had
yet
had
to
de
montfort
therefore
justly
belongs
the
glory
of
being
the
founder
of
the
house
of
commons
his
work
however
was
defective
and
owing
perhaps
to
his
death
shortly
afterwards
at
the
battle
of
evesham
the
regular
and
continuous
representation
of
the
towns
did
not
begin
until
thirty
years
later
they
were
first
summoned
by
john
in
meanwhile
three
land
laws
of
great
importance
were
enacted
the
first
limited
the
acquisition
of
landed
property
by
the
church
the
second
encouraged
the
transmission
of
land
by
will
to
the
eldest
son
thus
keeping
estates
together
instead
of
breaking
them
up
among
several
heirs
the
third
made
purchasers
of
estates
the
direct
feudal
tenants
of
the
king
the
object
of
these
three
laws
was
to
prevent
landholders
from
evading
their
feudal
obligations

has
kept
substantially
ever
since
we
shall
see
how
from
this
time
the
commons
gradually
grew
in
influence
though
with
periods
of
relapse
until
at
length
they
have
become
the
controlling
power
in
legislation
de

parliament
was
not
wholly
lawful
and
regular
because
not
voluntarily
summoned
by
the
king
himself
parliament
must
be
summoned
by
the
sovereign
opened
by
the
sovereign
in
person
or
by
commission
all
laws
require
the
sovereign
signature
to
complete
them
and
finally
parliament
can
be
suspended
or
dissolved
by
the
sovereign
only
the
lower
clergy
were
summoned
to
send
representatives
to
the
commons
but
they
came
very
irregularly
and
in
the
fourteenth
centrury
ceased
coming
altogether
from
that
time
they
voted
their
supplies
for
the
crown
in
convocation
until
when
convocation
ceased
to
meet
the
higher
clergy
bishops
and
abbots
met
with
the
house
of
lords
two
years
after
the
meeting
of
the
model

in
order
to
get
money
to
carry
on
a
war
with
france
edward
levied
a
tax
on
the
barons
and
seized
a
large
quantity
of
wool
belonging
to
the
merchants
so
determined
was
the
resistance
to
these
acts
that
civil
war
was
threatened
in
order
to
avert
it
the
king
was
obliged
to
summon
a
parliament
and
to
sign
a
confirmation
of
all
previous
charters
of
liberties
including
the
great
charter
he
furthermore
bound
himself
in
the
most
solemn
manner
not
to
tax
his
subjects
or
seize
their
goods
without
their
consent
henceforth
parliament
alone
was
considered
to
hold
control
of
the
nation
purse
and
although
this
principle
was
afterwards
evaded
no
king
openly
denied
its
binding
force
furthermore
in
edward
reign
the
house
of
commons
gained
for
the
first
time
a
direct
share
in
legislation
this
step
had
results
of
supreme
constitutional
importance

by

power
over
the

in
edward
iii
reign
a
great
change
occurred
in
parliament
the
knights
of
the
shire
about
joined
the
representatives
from
the
towns
and
began
to
sit
apart
from
the
lords
as
a
distince
house
of
commons
this
union
gave
that
house
a
new
charactyer
and
invested
it
with
a
power
in
parliament
which
the
representation
from
the
towns
alone
could
not
have
exerted
but
though
thus
strengthened
the
commons
did
not
venture
to
claim
an
equal
part
with
the
lords
in
framing
laws
their
attitude
was
that
of
humble
petitioners
when
they
had
voted
the
supplies
of
money
which
the
king
asked
for
the
commons
might
then
meekly
beg
for
legislation
even
when
the
king
and
the
lords
assented
to
their
petitions
the
commons
often
found
to
their
disappointment
that
the
laws
which
had
been
promised
did
not
correspond
to
those
for
which
they
had
asked
henry
v
pledged
his
word
that
the
petitions
when
accepted
should
be
made
into
laws
without
any
alteration
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
was
not
effectually
done
until
the
close
of
the
reign
of
henry
vi
about
then
the
commons
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
right
to
present
proposed
laws
in
the
form
of
regular
bills
instead
of
petitions
these
bills
when
enacted
became
statues
or
acts
of
parliament
as
we
know
them
this
change
was
a
most
important
one
since
it
made
it
impossible
for
the
king
with
the
lords
to
fraudulently
defeat
the
expressed
will
of
the
commons
after
they
had
once
assented
to
the
legislation
which
the
commons
desired
meanwhile
the
commons
gained
for
the
first
time
the
right
of
impeaching
such
ministers
of
the
crown
as
they
had
reason
to
believe
were
unfaithful
to
the
interests
of
the
people
this
of
course
put
an
immense
restraining
power
in
their
hands
since
they
could
now
make
the
ministers
responsible
in
great
measure
for
the
king
but
after
the
commons
ceased
to
exercise
the
right
of
impeachment
until
when
they
impeached
lord
bacon
and
others
next
the
commons
insisted
on
having
an
account
rendered
of
the
money
spent
by
the
king
and
at
times
they
even
limited
their
appropriations
of
money
to
particular
purposes
finally
in
the
commons
took
the
most
decided
step
of
all
they
boldly
demanded
and
obtained
exclusive
right
of
making
all
grants
of
required
by
the
crown
this
right
the
commons
never
surrendered
in
future
the
king
unless
he
violated
the
law
had
to
look
to
the
commons
that
is
to
the
direct
representation
of
the
mass
of
the
people
for
his
chief
supplies
this
made
the
will
of
the
commons
more
powerful

it
had
ever
been

the
parliament
of
merton
had
already
refused
to
introduce
the
canon
or
ecclesiatical
law
in
the
next
century
two
very
important
statutes
relating
to
the
church
were
enacted
that
of
provisors
and
the
great
act
of
praemunire
limiting
the
power
of
the
pope
over
the
english
church
on
the
other
hand
the
rise
of
the
lollards
had
caused
a
statute
to
be
passed
against
heretics
and
under
it
the
first
martyr
had
been
burned
in
england
during
this
period
the
villeins
had
risen
in
insurrection
and
were
gradually
gaining
their
liberty
thus
a
very
large
body
of
people
who
had
been
practically
excluded
from
political
rights
now
began
to
slowly
acquire
them
but
on
the
other
hand
a
statute
was
enacted
which
prohibited
all
persons
having
an
income
of
less
than
forty
shillings
a
year
or
what
would
be
equal
to
forty
pounds
at
the
present
value
of
money
from
voting
for
knights
of
the
shire
the
consequence
was
that
the
poorer
and
humbler
classes
in
the
country
were
no
longer
directly
represented
in
the
house
of
commons
provisors
this
was
a
law
forbidding
the
pope
to
provide
any
person
by

with

the
death
of
the
incumbent

neither
the
law
of

nor
of
praemunire
was
strictly
enforced
until
henry

villeins
appear
however
to
have
had

right
of

for

revival

its
power
under
elizabeth
the
civil
wars
of
the
roses
gave
a
decided
check
to
the
further
development
of
parliamentary
power
many
noble
families
were
ruined
by
the
protracted
struggle
and
the
new
nobles
created
by
the
king
were
pledged
to
uphold
the
interests
of
the
crown
furthemore
numerous
towns
absorbed
in
their
own
local
affairs
ceased
to
elect
members
to
the
commons
thus
with
a
house
of
lords
on
the
side
of
royal
authority
and
with
a
house
of
commons
diminished
in
numbers
and
in
influence
the
decline
of
the
independent
attitude
of
parliament
was
inevitable
the
result
of
these
changes
was
very
marked
from
the
reign
of
henry
vi
to
that
of
elizabeth
a
period
of
nearly
a
hundred
and
forty
years
the
voice
of
parliament
was
rarely
heard
the
tudors
practically
set
up
a
new
or
personal
monarchy
in
which
their
will
rose
above
both
parliament
and
the
constitution
and
henry
vii
instead
of
asking
the
commons
for
money
extorted
it
by
fines
enforcedby
his
court
of
star

compelled
his
wealthy
subjects
to
grant
it
to
him
in
benevolences

loving

called
them
lovingly

henry

power
was
restrained
by
certain
checks

and
even
henry

generally
ruled

however
much
he
may
have
violated
its
spirit
it
is
noticable
too
that
it
was
under
henry
viii
that
parliament
first
formally
claimed
freedom
of
speech
as
one
of
its
undoubted
privieges
during
this
period
england
laid
claim
to
a
new
continent
and
henry
viii
repudiating
the
authority
of
the
pope
declared
himself
the
supreme
head
of
the
english
catholic
church
in
the
next
reign
edward
vi
the
catholic
worship
which
had
existed
in
england
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
was
abolished
and
the
protestant
faith
became
henceforth
except
during
mary
short
reign
the
established
religion
of
the
kingdom
it
was
enforced
by
two
acts
of
uniformity
one
effect
of
the
overthrow
of
catholicism
was
to
change
the
character
of
the
house
of
lords
by
reducing
the
number
of
spiritual
lords
from
a
majority
to
a
minority
as
they
have
ever
since
remained
note
at
the
beginning
of
elizabeth
reign
the
second
act
of
supremacy
shut
out
all
catholics
from
the
house
of
commons
protestantism
was
fully
and
finally
established
as
the
state
religion
embodied
in
the
creed
known
as
the
articles
and
by
the
third
act
of
uniformity
very
severe
measures
were
taken
against
all
whether
catholics
or
puritans
who
refused
to
conform
to
the
episcopal
mode
of
worship
the
high
commission
court
was
organized
to
try
and
to
to
punish
heretics
whether
catholics
or
puritans
the
great
number
of
paupers
caused
by
the
destruction
of
the
monasteries
under
henry
viii
and
the
gradual
decay
of
relations
of
feudal
service
caused
the
passage
of
the
first
poor
law
and
so
brought
the
government
face
to
face
with
a
problem
which
has
never
yet
been
satisfactorily
settled
namely
what
to
do
with
habitual
paupers
and
tramps
by
the
third
act
of
uniformity
and
the
establishment
of
the
high
commission
court
the
first
and
second
acts
of
uniformity
were
enacted
under
edward
vi
the
closing
part
of
elizabeth
reign
marks
the
revival
of
parliamentary
power
the
house
of
commons
now
had
many
puritan
members
and
they
did
not
hesitate
to
assert
their
right
to
advise
the
queen
on
all
questions
of
national
importance
elizabeth
sharply
rebuked
them
for
presuming
to
meddle
with
questions
of
religion
or
for
urging
her
either
to
take
a
husband
or
to
name
a
successor
to
the
throne
but
even
she
did
not
venture
to
run
directly
counter
to
the
will
of
the
people
when
the
commons
demanded
that
she
should
put
a
stop
to
the
pernicious
practice
of
granting
trading
monopolies
to
her
favorites
she
was
obliged
to
yield
her
assent
james
i
the
divine
right
of
kings
struggle
with
parliament
james
began
his
reign
by
declaring
that
kings
rule
not
by
the
will
of
the
people
but
by
divine
right
god
makes
the
king
said
he
and
the
king
makes
the
law
for
this
reason
he
demanded
that
his
proclamations
should
have
all
the
force
of
acts
of
parliament
furthermore
since
he
appointed
the
judges
he
could
generally
get
their
decisions
to
support
him
thus
he
made
even
the
courts
of
justice
serve
as
instruments
of
his
will
in
his
arrogance
he
declared
that
neither
parliament
nor
the
people
had
any
right
to
discuss
matters
of
state
whether
foreign
or
domestic
since
he
was
resolved
to
reserve
such
questions
for
the
royal
intellect
to
deal
with
by
his
religious
intolerance
he
maddened
both
puritans
and
catholics
and
the
pilgrim
fathers
fled
from
england
to
escape
his
tyranny
but
there
was
a
limit
set
to
his
overbearing
conceit
when
he
dictated
to
the
commons
what
persons
should
sit
in
that
body
they
indignantly
refused
to
submit
to
any
interference
on
his
part
and
their
refusal
was
so
emphatic
that
james
never
brought
the
matter
up
again
the
king
however
was
so
determined
to
shut
out
members
whom
he
did
not
like
that
he
attempted
to
gain
his
ends
by
having
such
persons
seized
on
charges
of
debt
and
thrown
into
prison
the
commons
on
the
other
hand
not
only
insisted
that
their
ancient
privilege
of
exemption
from
arrest
in
such
cases
should
be
respected
but
they
passed
a
special
law
to
clinch
the
privilege
ten
years
later
james
pressed
for
money
called
a
parliament
to
get
supplies
he
had
taken
precautions
to
get
a
majority
of
members
elected
who
would
he
hoped
vote
for
him
what
he
wanted
but
to
his
dismay
the
commons
declined
to
grant
him
a
penny
unless
he
would
promise
to
cease
imposing
illegal
duties
on
merchandise
the
king
angrily
refused
and
dissolved
the
addled
parliament
this
parliament
was
nicknamed
the
addled
parliament
because
it
did
not
enact
a
single
law
though
it
most
effectually
addled
the
king
plans
finally
in
order
to
show
james
that
it
would
not
be
trifled
with
a
later
parliament
revived
the
right
of
impeachment
which
had
not
been
resorted
to
since
the
commons
now
charged
lord
chancellor
bacon
judge
of
the
high
court
of
chancery
and
keeper
of
the
king
conscience
with
accepting
bribes
bacon
held
the
highest
office
in
the
gift
of
the
crown
and
the
real
object
of
the
impeachment
was
to
strike
the
king
through
the
person
of
his
chief
official
and
supporter
bacon
confessed
his
crime
saying
i
was
the
justest
judge
that
was
in
england
these
fifty
years
but
it
was
the
justest
censure
in
parliament
that
was
these
two
hundred
years
see
of
this
summary
james
tried
his
best
to
save
his
servile
favorite
but
it
was
useless
and
bacon
was
convicted
disgraced
and
partially
punished
the
commons
of
the
same
parliament
petitioned
the
king
against
the
alleged
growth
of
the
catholic
religion
in
the
knigdom
and
especially
against
the
proposed
marriage
of
the
prince
of
wales
to
a
spanish
catholic
princess
james
ordered
the
commons
to
let
mysteries
of
the
state
alone
they
claimed
liberty
of
speech
the
king
asserted
that
they
had
no
liberties
except
such
as
the
royal
power
saw
fit
to
grant
then
the
commons
drew
up
their
famous
protest
in
which
they
declared
that
their
liberties
were
not
derived
from
the
king
but
were
the
ancient
and
undoubted
birthright
and
inheritance
of
the
people
of
england
in
his
rage
james
ordered
the
journal
of
the
commons
to
be
brought
to
him
tore
out
the
protest
with
his
own
hand
and
sent
five
of
the
members
of
the
house
to
prison
this
rash
act
made
the
commons
more
determined
than
ever
not
to
yield
to
arbitrary
power
james
died
three
years
later
leaving
his
unfortunate
son
charles
to
settle
the
angry
controversy
he
had
raised
macaulay
remarks
that
james
seems
to
have
been
sent
to
hasten
the
coming
of
the
civil
war
charles
i
forced
loans
the
petition
of
right
charles
i
came
to
the
throne
full
of
his
father
lofty
ideas
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
to
govern
as
they
pleased
in
private
life
he
was
conscientious
but
in
his
public
policy
he
was
a
man
of
dark
and
crooked
ways
he
had
married
a
french
catholic
princess
and
the
puritans
who
were
now
very
strong
in
the
house
of
commons
suspected
that
the
king
secretly
sympathized
with
the
queen
religion
this
was
not
the
case
for
charles
after
his
peculiar
fashion
was
a
sincere
protestant
though
he
favored
the
introduction
into
the
english
church
of
some
of
the
ceremonies
peculiar
to
catholic
worship
the
commons
showed
their
distrust
of
the
king
by
voting
him
the
tax
of
tonnage
and
poundage
certain
duties
levied
on
wine
and
merchandise
for
a
single
year
only
instead
of
for
life
as
had
been
their
custom
the
lords
refused
to
assent
to
such
a
limited
grant
and
charles
deliberately
collected
the
tax
without
the
authority
of
parliament
failing
however
to
get
a
sufficient
supply
in
that
way
the
king
forced
men
of
property
to
grant
him
benevolences
and
to
loan
him
large
sums
of
money
with
no
hope
of
its
return
those
who
dared
to
refuse
were
thrown
into
prison
on
some
pretended
charge
or
had
squads
of
brutal
soldiers
quartered
in
their
houses
see
revised
edition
note
when
even
these
measures
failed
to
supply
his
wants
charles
was
forced
to
summon
a
parliament
and
ask
for
help
instead
of
granting
it
the
commons
drew
up
the
petition
of
right
of
as
an
indignant
remonstrance
and
as
a
safeguard
against
further
acts
of
tyranny
this
petition
has
been
called
the
second
great
charter
of
the
liberties
of
england
it
declared
that
no
one
should
be
compelled
to
pay
any
tax
or
to
supply
the
king
with
money
except
by
order
of
act
of
parliament
that
neither
soldiers
nor
sailors
should
be
quartered
in
private
houses
that
no
one
should
be
imprisoned
or
punished
contrary
to
law
charles
was
forced
by
his
need
of
money
to
assent
to
this
petition
which
thus
became
a
most
important
part
of
the
english
constitution
but
the
king
did
not
keep
his
word
when
parliament
next
met
it
refused
to
grant
money
unless
charles
would
renew
his
pledge
not
to
violate
the
law
the
king
made
some
concessions
but
finally
resolved
to
adjourn
parliament
several
members
of
the
commons
held
the
speaker
in
the
chair
by
force
thus
preventing
the
adjournment
of
the
house
until
resolutions
offered
by
sir
john
eliot
were
passed
these
resolutions
were
aimed
directly
at
the
king
they
declared
that
he
is
a
traitor
who
attempts
any
change
in
the
established
religion
of
the
kingdom
who
levies
any
tax
not
voted
by
parliament
or
who
voluntarily
pays
such
a
tax
parliament
then
adjourned
petition
of
right
see
and
constitutional
documents
the
king
was
also
deprived
of
the
power
to
press
citizens
into
the
army
and
navy
the
puritans
had
come
to
believe
that
the
king
wished
to
restore
the
catholic
religion
as
the
established
church
of
england
but
in
this
idea
they
were
mistaken
thorough
ship
money
the
short
parliament
the
king
swore
that
the
vipers
who
opposed
him
should
have
their
reward
eliot
was
thrown
into
prison
and
kept
there
till
he
died
charles
made
up
his
mind
that
with
the
help
of
archbishop
laud
in
church
matters
and
of
lord
strafford
in
affairs
of
state
he
would
rule
without
parliaments
strafford
urged
the
king
to
adopt
the
policy
of
thorough
in
other
words
to
follow
the
bent
of
his
own
will
without
consulting
the
will
of
the
nation
this
of
course
practically
meant
the
overthrow
of
parliamentary
and
constitutional
government
charles
heartily
approved
of
this
plan
for
setting
up
what
he
called
a
beneficent
despotism
based
on
divine
right
thorough
strafford
wrote
to
laud
you
may
govern
as
you
please
am
confident
that
the
king
is
able
to
carry
any
just
and
honorable
action
thorough
through
or
against
all
imaginable
opposition
both
strafford
and
laud
used
the
word
thorough
in
this
sense
to
designate
their
tyrannical
policy
the
king
now
resorted
to
various
unconstitutional
means
to
obtain
supplies
the
last
device
he
hit
upon
was
that
of
raising
ship
money
to
do
this
he
levied
a
tax
on
all
the
counties
of
england
inland
as
well
as
seaboard
on
the
pretext
that
he
purposed
building
a
neavy
for
the
defense
of
the
kingdom
john
hampden
refused
to
pay
the
tax
but
charles
servile
judges
decided
against
him
when
the
case
was
brought
into
court
charles
ruled
without
a
parliament
for
eleven
years
he
might
perhaps
have
gone
on
in
this
way
for
as
many
more
had
he
not
provoked
the
scots
to
rebel
by
attempting
to
force
a
modified
form
of
the
english
prayer
book
on
the
church
of
that
country
the
necessities
of
the
war
with
the
scots
compelled
the
king
to
call
a
parliament
it
declined
to
grant
the
king
money
to
carry
on
the
war
unless
he
would
give
some
satisfactory
guarantee
of
governing
according
to
the
will
of
the
people
charles
refused
to
do
this
and
after
a
three
weeks
session
he
dissolved
what
was
known
as
the
short
parliament
the
long
parliament
the
civil
war
but
the
war
gave
charles
no
choice
and
before
the
year
was
out
he
was
obliged
to
call
the
famous
long
parliament
of
that
body
met
with
the
firm
determination
to
restore
the
liberties
of
englishmen
or
to
perish
in
the
attempt
it
impeached
strafford
and
laud
and
sent
them
to
the
scaffold
as
traitors
it
swept
away
those
instruments
of
royal
oppression
the
court
of
star
chamber
and
the
high
commission
court
it
expelled
the
bishops
from
the
house
of
lords
it
passed
the
triennial
bill
compelling
the
king
to
summon
a
parliament
at
least
once
in
three
years
it
also
passed
a
law
declaring
that
the
king
could
not
suspend
or
dissolve
parliament
without
its
consent
last
of
all
the
commons
drew
up
the
grand
remonstrance
enunciating
at
great
length
the
grievances
of
the
last
sixteen
years
and
vehemently
appealing
to
the
people
to
support
them
in
their
attempts
at
reform
the
remonstrance
was
printed
and
distributed
throughout
england
the
long
parliament
it
sat
from
to
and
was
not
finally
dissolved
until
charles
assured
strafford
that
parliament
should
not
touch
a
hair
of
his
head
but
to
save
himself
the
king
signed
the
bill
of
attainder
see
which
sent
his
ablest
and
most
faithful
servant
to
the
block
well
might
strafford
exclaim
put
not
your
trust
in
princes
the
triennial
act
was
repealed
in
and
reenacted
in
in
the
septennial
act
increased
the
limit
of
three
years
to
seven
this
act
is
still
in
force
the
press
soon
became
for
the
first
time
a
most
active
agent
of
political
agitation
both
for
and
against
the
king
about
a
month
later
the
king
at
the
head
of
an
armed
force
undertook
to
seize
hampden
pym
and
three
other
of
the
most
active
members
of
the
commons
on
a
charge
of
treason
the
attempt
failed
soon
afterwards
the
commons
passed
the
militia
bill
and
thus
took
the
command
of
the
national
militia
and
of
the
chief
fortresses
of
the
realm
to
hold
as
they
said
for
king
and
parliament
the
act
was
unconstitutional
but
after
the
attempted
seizure
of
the
five
members
the
commons
felt
certain
that
if
they
left
the
command
of
the
militia
in
the
king
hands
they
would
simply
sign
their
own
death
warrant
in
resentment
of
this
action
charles
now
began
the
great
civil
war
it
resulted
in
the
execution
of
the
king
and
in
the
temporary
overthrow
of
the
monarchy
the
house
of
lords
and
the
established
episcopal
church
in
place
of
the
monarchy
the
party
in
power
set
up
a
puritan
republic
this
was
followed
by
the
protectorate
of
oliver
cromwell
which
claimed
to
be
republican
in
spirit
and
by
that
of
his
son
richard
charles
ii
abolition
of
feudal
tenure
establishment
of
a
standing
army
in
the
people
weary
of
the
protectorate
form
of
government
welcomed
the
return
of
charles
ii
his
coming
marks
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
of
the
house
of
lords
and
of
the
national
episcopal
church
a
great
change
was
now
effected
in
the
source
of
the
king
revenue
hitherto
it
had
sprung
largely
from
feudal
dues
these
had
long
been
difficult
to
collect
because
the
feudal
system
had
practically
died
out
the
feudal
land
tenure
with
its
dues
was
now
abolished
a
reform
says
blackstone
greater
even
than
that
of
magna
carta
and
in
their
place
a
tax
was
levied
for
a
fixed
sum
this
tax
should
in
justice
have
fallen
on
the
landowners
who
profited
by
the
change
but
they
managed
to
evade
it
in
great
measure
and
by
getting
it
levied
on
beer
and
some
other
liquors
they
forced
the
working
classes
to
shoulder
the
chief
part
of
the
burden
which
they
carried
until
very
recently
see
of
this
summary
parliament
now
restored
the
command
of
the
militia
to
the
kign
and
for
the
first
time
in
english
history
it
also
gave
him
the
command
of
a
standing
army
of
five
thousand
men
thus
in
one
way
making
him
more
powerful
than
ever
before
see
militia
bill
of
this
summary
on
the
other
hand
parliament
revived
the
practice
of
limiting
its
appropriations
of
money
to
specific
purposes
it
furthermore
began
to
require
an
exact
account
of
how
the

great
ambition

get
an

passed

catholics
were
shut
out
from

up

catholic
nobleman

leading

further
showed
its
power
by
compelling
the
king
to
sign
the

put
an
end
to
his
arbitrarily
throwing

the
pretended
popish
plot
to
kill
the
king
in
order
to
place
his
brother
james
a
catholic
convert
on
the
throne
caused
the
rise
of
a
strong
movement
to
exclude
james
from
the
right
of
succession
the
exclusion
bill
failed
but
the
disabling

was
passed
excluding

from
sitting
in

house

but
an
exception
was
made
in

of

henceforward
two
prominent
political
parties
appear
in

one
that
of
the
whigs
or
liberals
bent
on
extending
the
power
of

the
other
that
of
the
tories
or
conservatives
resolved
to
maintain
the
power
of
the
crown
charles

of
course
did
all
in
his
power
to
encourage
the
latter
party
in
order
to
strengthen
their
numbers
in
the
commons
he
found
pretexts
for
revoking
the
charters
of
many
whig
towns
he
then
issued
new
charters
to
these
towns
giving
the
power
of
election
to
the
tories
while
engaged
in
this
congenial
work
the
king
died
and
his
brother
james
ii
came
to
the
throne
the
right
of
election
in
many
towns
was
then
confined
to
the
town
officers
or
to
a
few
influential
inhabitants
this
continued
to
be
the
case
until
the
passage
of
the
reform
bill
in
james
ii
the
dispensing
power
declaration
of
indulgence
the
revolution
of
james
ii
was
a
zealous
catholic
and
therefore
naturally
desired
to
secure
freedom
of
worship
in
england
for
people
of
his
own
faith
in
his
zeal
he
went
too
far
and
the
pope
expressed
his
disgust
at
the
king
foolish
rashness
by
the
exercise
of
the
dispensing
power
he
suspended
the
test
act
and
the
act
of
uniformity
in
order
that
catholics
might
be
relieved
from
the
penalties
imposed
by
these
laws
and
also
for
the
purpose
of
giving
them
civil
and
military
offices
from
which
the
test
act
excluded
them
james
also
established
a
new
high
commission
court
and
made
the
infamous
judge
jeffreys
the
head
of
this
despotic
tribunal
this
court
had
the
supervision
of
all
churches
and
institutions
of
education
its
main
object
was
to
further
the
spread
of
catholicism
and
to
silence
those
clergymen
who
preached
against
that
faith
the
king
appointed
a
catholic
president
of
magdalen
college
oxford
and
expelled
from
the
college
all
who
opposed
the
appointment
later
he
issued
two
declarations
of
indulgence
in
which
he
proclaimed
universal
religious
toleration
it
was
generally
believed
that
under
cover
of
these
declarations
the
king
intended
to
favor
the
ascendancy
of
catholicism
seven
bishops
who
petitioned
for
the
privilege
of
declining
to
read
the
declarations
from
their
pulpits
were
imprisoned
but
on
their
trial
were
acquitted
by
a
jury
in
full
sympathy
with
them
new
high
commission
court
see
of
this
summary
these
acts
by
the
king
together
with
the
fact
that
he
had
greatly
increased
the
standing
army
and
had
stationed
it
just
outside
of
london
caused
great
alarm
throughout
england
the
majority
of
the
people
of
both
political
parties
believed
that
james
was
plotting
to
subverty
and
extirpate
the
protestant
religion
and
the
laws
and
liberties
of
the
kingdom
see
the
language

still
so
long
as
the
king
remained
childless
the
nation
was
encouraged
by
the
hope
that
james
daughter
mary
might
succeed
him
she
was
known
to
be
a
decided
protestant
and
she
had
married
william
prince
of
orange
the
head
of
the
protestant
republic
of
holland
but
the
birth
of
a
son
to
james
put
an
end
to
that
hope
immediately
a
number
of
leading
whigs
and
tories
united
in
sending
an
invitation
to
the
prince
of
orange
to
come
over
to
england
with
an
army
to
protect
parliament
against

came
james
fled
to

a
convention
parliament
drew
up
a
declaration
of
right
which
declared
that
the
king
had
vacated
the
throne
and
the
crown
was
therefore
offered
to
william
and
mary
they
accepted
thus
by
the
bloodless
revolution
of
the
english
nation
transferred
the
sovereignty
to
those
who
had
no
direct
legal
claim
to
it
so
long
as
james
and
his
son
were
living
hence
by
this
act
the
people
deliberately
set
aside
hereditary
succession
as
a
binding
rule
and
revived
the
primitive
english
custom
of
choosing
a
sovereign
as
they
deemed
best
in
this
sense
the
uprising
of
was
most
emphatically
a
revolution
it
made
as
green
has
said
an
english
monarch
as
much
the
creature
of
an
act
of
parliament
as
the
pettiest
taxgatherer
in
his
realm
but
it
was
a
still
greater
revolution
in
another
way
since
it
gave
a
deathblow
to
the
direct
personal
monarchy
which
began
with
the
tudors
two
hundred
years
before
it
is
true
that
in
george
reign
we
shall
see
that
power
temporarily
revived
but
we
shall
never
hear
anything
more
of
that
divine
right
of
kings
for
which
one
stuary
lost
his
head
and
another
his
crown
henceforth
the
house
of
commons
will
govern
england
although
as
we
shall
see
it
will
be
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
that
house
will
be
able
to
free
itself
entirely
from
the
control
of
either
a
few
powerful
families
on
the
one
hand
or
that
of
the
crown
on
the
other
convention
parliament
it
was
so
called
because
it
was
not
regularly
summoned
by
the

having
fled

by

to
make
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
people
unmistakably
clear

bill
of

an
expansion
of
the
declaration
of
right
was
drawn
up
the
bill
of

declare
that
there
should
be
no
suspension
or
change
in
the
laws
and
no
taxation
except
by
act
of
parliament
that
there
should
be
freedom
of
election
to
parliament
and
freedom
of
speech
in
parliament
both
rights
that
the
stuarts
had
attempted
to
contrl
that
the
sovereign
should
not
keep
a
standing
army
in
time
of
peace
except
by
consent
of
parliament
that
in
future
no
roman
catholic
should
sit
on

throne
this
last
clause
was
reaffirmed
by

this
most
important
bill
having
received
the
signature
of
william
and
mary
became
law
it
constitutes
the
third
great
written
charter
or
safeguard
of
english
liberty
taken
in
connection
with
magna
carta
and
the
petition
of
right
it
forms
according
to
lord
chatham
bible
of
english
but
parliament
had
not
yet
finished
the
work
of
reform
it
had
taken
in
hand
the
executive
strength
of
every
government
depends
on
its
control
of
two
powers
the
purse
and
the
sword
parliament
had
as
we
have
seen
got
a
tight
grasp
on
the
first
for
the
commons
and
the
commons
alone
could
levy
taxes
but
within
certain
very
wide
limits
the
personal
expenditure
of
the
sovereign
still
practically
remained
unchecked
parliament
now
took
the
decisive
step
of
voting
by
the
revenue
act
a
specific
sum
for
the
maintenance
of
the
crown
and
of
voting
this
supply
not
for
the
life
of
the
sovereign
as
had
been
the
custom
but
for
four
years
a
little
later
this
supply
was
fixed
for
a
signle
year
only
this
action
gave
to
the
commons
final
and
complete
control
of
the
purse
next
parliament
passed
the
mutiny
act
which
granted
the
king
power
to
enforce
martial
law
in
other
words
to
maintain
a
standing
army
for
one
year
at
a
time
and
no
longer
save
by
renewal
of
the
law
this
act
gave
parliament
complete
control
of
the
sword
and
thus
finished
the
great
work
for
without
the
annual
meeting
and
the
annual
vote
of
that
body
an
english
sovereign
would
at
the
end
of
a
twelvemonth
stand
penniless
and
helpless
reforms
in
the
courts
the
toleration
act
the
press
made
free
the
same
year
parliament
effected
great
and
sorely
needed
reforms
in
the
administration
of
justice
next
parliament
passed
the
toleration
act
this
measure
granted
liberty
of
worship
to
all
protestant
dissenters
except
those
who
denied
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
the
toleration
act
however
did
not
abolish
the
corporation
act
or
the
test
act
and
it
granted
no
religious
freedom
to
catholics
still
the
toleration
act
was
a
step
forward
and
it
prepared
the
way
for
that
absolute
liberty
of
worship
and
of
religious
belief
which
now
exists
in
england
freedom
of
worship
was
granted
to
unitarians
in
the
act
of
indemnity
of
and
passed
from
year
to
year
suspended
the
penalties
of
the
test
and
the
corporation
acts
they
were
both
repealed
in
later
the
fear
that
james
ii
might
be
invited
to
return
led
to
the
enactment
of
very
severe
laws
agaisnt
the
catholics
and
in
the
next
reign
anne
the
act
of
occasional
conformity
and
the
schism
act
were
directed
against
protestant
dissenters
in
finance
the
reign
of
william
and
mary
was
marked
by
the
practical
beginning
of
the
permanent
national
debt
in
and
by
the
establishment
in
of
the
bank
of
england
now
too
the
english
press
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
became
in
large
measure
free
though
hampered
by
a
very
severe
law
of
libel
and
by
stamp
duties
from
this
period
the
influence
of
newspapers
continued
to
increase
until
the
final
abolition
of
the
stamp
duty
made
it
possible
to
issue
penny
and
even
halfpenny
papers
at
a
profit
these
cheap
newspapers
sprang
at
once
into
an
immense
circulation
among
all
classes
and
thus
they
became
the
power
for
good
or
evil
according
to
their
character
which
they
are
so
that
it
would
be
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
back
of
the
power
of
parliament
now
stands
the
greater
power
of
the
press
debates
in
parliament
could
not
be
reported
until
and
certain
acts
checked
the
freedom
of
the
press
for
a
time
see
may
history
of
england
the
house
of
commons
no
longer
a
representative
body
the
first
two
georges
and
their
ministers
but
now
that
the
revolution
of
had
done
its
work
and
transferred
the
power
of
the
crown
to
the
house
of
commons
a
new
difficulty
arose
this
was
the
fact
that
the
commons
did
not
represent
the
people
but
stood
simply
as
the
representative
of
a
small
number
of
rich
whig
landowners
in
many
towns
the
right
to
vote
was
confined
to
the
town
officers
or
to
the
citizens
in
other
cases
towns
which
had
dwindled
in
population
to
a
very
few
inhavitants
continued
to
have
the
right
to
send
two
members
to
parliament
while
on
the
other
hand
large
and
flourishing
cities
had
grown
up
which
had
no
power
to
send
even
a
single
member
the
result
of
this
state
of
things
was
that
the
wealthy
whig
families
bought
up
the
votes
of
electors
and
so
regularly
controlled
the
elections
the
influence
of
the
whigs
had
secured
the
passage
of
the
act
of
settlement
which
brought
in
the
georges
for
this
reason
the
whigs
had
gained
the
chief
political
power
under
the
first
two
georges
both
of
whom
were
foreigners
the
ministers
especially
sir
robert
walpole

was

they
understood
the

politics
while
the
two
german
sovereigns
the
first
of
whom
never
learned
to
speak
english
neither
knew
nor
cared
anything
about
them
when
men
wanted
favors
or
offices
they
went
to
the
ministers
for
them
this
made
men
like
walpole
so
powerful
that

said
bitterly
in

the

are

revival

the
king
friends
george
iii
was
born
in
england
and
prided
himself
on
being
an
englishman
he
came
to
the
throne
fully
resolved
as
walpole
said
to
make
his
power
shine
out
and
to
carry
out
his
mother
constant
injunction
of
george
be
king
to
do
this
he
set
himself
to
work
to
trample
on
the
power
of
the
ministers
to
take
the
distribution
of
offices
and
honors
out
of
their
hands
and
furthermore
to
break
down
the
influence
of
the
great
whig
families
in
parliament
he
had
no
intention
of
reforming
the
house
of
commons
or
of
securing
the
representation
of
the
people
in
it
his
purpose
was
to
gain
the
control
of
the
house
and
use
it
for
his
own
ends
in
this
he
was
thoroughly
conscientious
according
to
his
idea
of
right
for
he
believed
with
all
his
heart
in
promoting
the
welfare
of
england
but
he
thought
that
welfare
depended
on
the
will
of
the
king
much
more
than
on
that
of
the
nation
his
maxim
was
everything
for
but
nothing
by
the
people
by
liberal
gifts
of
money
he
spent
pounds
in
a
single
day
in
bribes
by
gifts
of
offices
and
of
honors
to
those
who
favored
him
and
by
taking
away
offices
honors
and
pensions
from
those
who
opposed
him
george
iii
succeeded
in
his
purpose
he
raised
up
a
body
of
men
in
parliament
known
by
the
significant
name
of
the
king
friends
who
stood
ready
at
all
times
to
vote
for
his
measures
in
this
way
he
actually
revived
personal
monarchy
for
a
time
and
by
using
his
friends
in
the
house
of
commons
and
in
the
lords
as
his
tools
he
made
himself
quite
independent
of
the
checks
imposed
by
the
constitution
pitt
lord
chatham
was
one
of
the
few
public
men
of
that
day
who
would
neither
give
nor
take
a
bribe
walpole
declared
with
entire
truth
that
the
great
majority
of
politicians
could
be
bought
it
was
only
a
question
of
price
the
king
appears
to
have
economized
in
his
living
in
order
to
get
more
money

use

the

the
king
power
reached
its
greatest
height
between
and
he
made
most
disastrous
use
of
it
not
only
at
home
but
abroad
he
insisted
that
the
english
colonists
in
america
should
pay
taxes
without
representation
in
parliament
even
of
that
imperfect
kind
which
then
existed

resolution
in

commons
resolved
that
the
power
of

is
increasing
and

this
vigorous
proposition
came
too
late
to
affect
the
conduct
of
the
war
and
england
lost
the
most
valuable
of
her
colonial
possessions
the
struggle
which
ended
successfully
for
the
patriots
in
america
was
in
reality
part
of
the
same
battle
fought
in
england
by
other
patriots
in
the
halls
of
parliament
on
the
western
side
of
the
atlantic
it
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
national
independence
on
the
eastern
side
in
the
final
overthrow
of
royal
tyranny
and
the
triumph
of
the
constitution
it
furthermore
laid
the
foundation
of
that
just
and
generous
policy
on
the
part
of
england
toward
canada
and
her
other
colonies
which
has
made
her
mistress
of
the
largest
and
most
prosperous
empire
on
the
globe
the
area
of
the
british
empire
in
was
nearly
square
miles
john
wilkes
and
the
middlesex
elections
publication
of
parliamentary
debates
meanwhile
john
wilkes
a
member
of
the
house
of
commons
had
gained
the
recognition
of
a
most
important
principle
he
was
a
coarse
and
violent
opponent
of
the
royal
policy
and
had
been
expelled
from
the
house
on
account
of
his
bitter
personal
attack
on
the
king
several
years
later
he
was
reelected
to
parliament
but
was
again
expelled
for
seditious
libel
he
was
three
times
reelected
by
the
people
of
london
and
middlesex
who
looked
upon
him
as
the
champion
of
their
cause
each
time
the
house
refused
to
permit
him
to
take
his
seat
but
at
the
fourth
election
he
was
successful
a
few
years
later
he
induced
the
house
to
strike
out
from
its
journal
the
resolution
there
recorded
against
him
thus
wilkes
by
his
indomitable
persistency
succeeded
in
establishing
the
right
of
the
people
to
elect
the
candidate
of
their
choice
to
parliament
during
the
same
period
the
people
gained
another
great
victory
over
parliament
that
body
had
utterly
refused
to
permit
the
debates
to
be
reported
in
the
newspaperes
but
the
redoubtable
wilkes
was
determined
to
obtain
and
publish
such
reports
rather
than
have
another
prolonged
battle
with
him
parliament
conceded
the
privilege
the
result
was
that
the
public
then
for
the
first
time
began
to
know
what
business
parliament
actually
transactaed
and
how
it
was
done
this
fact
of
course
rendered
the
members
of
both
houses
far
more
directly
responsible
to
the
will
of
the
people
than
they
had
ever
been
before
in
no
of
the
wilkes
rudely
accused
the
king
of
having
deliberately
uttered
a
falsehood
in
his
speech
to
parliament
the
libel
was
contained
in
a
letter
written
to
the
newspapers
by
wilkes
the
resolution
was
finally
stricken
out
on
the
ground
that
it
was
subversive
of
the
rights
of
the
whole
body
of
electors
the
publication
of
division
lists
equivalent
to
yeas
and
nays
by
the
house
of
commons
in
and
by
the
lords
in
completed
this
work
since
then
the
public
have
known
how
each
member
of
parliament
votes
on
every
important
question
the
reform
bills
of
demand
for
manhood
suffrage
but
notwithstanding
this
decided
political
progress
still
the
greatest
reform
of
all
that
of
the
system
of
electing
members
of
parliament
still
remained
to
be
accomplished
cromwell
had
attempted
it
but
the
restoration
put
an
end
to
the
work
which
the
protector
had
so
wisely
begun
lord
chatham
felt
the
necessity
so
strongly
that
he
had
not
hesitated
to
declare
that
the
system
of
representation
or
rather
misrepresentation
which
then
existed
was
the
rotten
part
of
the
constitution
if
it
does
not
drop
said
he
it
must
be
amputated
later
he
became
so
alarmed
at
the
prospect
that
he
declared
that
before
the
end
of
the
century
either
the
parliament
will
reform
itself
from
within
or
be
reformed
from
without
with
a
vengeance
but
the
excitement
caused
by
the
french
revolution
and
the
wars
with
napoleon
not
only
prevented
any
general
movement
of
reform
but
made
it
possible
to
enact
the
six
acts
and
other
stringent
laws
against
agitation
in
that
direction
finally
however
the
unrepresented
classes
rose
in
their
might
and
by
terrible
riots
made
it
evident
that
it
would
be
dangerous
for
parliament
to
postpone
action
on
their
demands
the
reform
bill
the
great
charter
of
swept
away
the
rotten
boroughs
which
had
disgraced
the
country
it
granted
the
right
of
election
to
many
large
towns
which
had
hitherto
been
unable
to
send
members
to
parliament
and
it
placed
representation
on
a
broader
healthier
and
more
equuitable
basis
than
had
ever
existed
before
it
was
a
significant
fact
that
when
the
first
reformed
parliament
met
composed
largely
of
liberals
it
showed
its
true
spirit
by
abolishing
slavery
in
the
west
indies
it
was
followed
by
the
municipal
reform
act
of
later
the
chartists
advocated
further
reforms
most
of
which
have
since
been
adopted
in
an
act
scarcely
less
important
than
that
of
broadened
representation
still
further
and
in
the
franchise
was
again
extended
a
little
later
the
county
council
act
reconstructed
the
local
of
the
country
in
great
measure
it
was
supplemented
in
by
the
parish
council
act
the
cry
is
now
for
unrestricted
manhood
suffrage
on
the
principle
of
one
man
one
vote
woman
suffrage
in
a
limited
degree
has
existed
since
the
local
government
act
this
gives
to
counties
the
management
of
their
local
affairs
and
secures
uniformity
of
method
and
of
administration
that
is
the
abolition
of
certain
franchise
privileges
springing
from
the
possession
of
landed
property
in
different
counties
or
parliamentary
districts
by
which
the
owner
of
such
property
is
entitled
to
cast

than
one

meanwhile
immense
progress
was
made
in
extending
the
principles
of
religious
liberty
to
all
bodies
of
believers
after
nearly
three
hundred
years
or
since
the
second
act
of
supremacy
catholics
were
admitted
in
to
the

and
in
the
next
generation
jews
were
likewise
admitted

commercially
the
nation
has
made
equal
progress
the
barbarous
corn
laws
were
repealed
in
the
narrow
protective
policy
of
centuries
abandoned
and
since
that
period
england
has

there

of
scotland
ireland
was
politically
united
to
great
britain
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
when
the
first
imperial
parliament
met
but
long
after
the
irish
catholics
had
obtained
the
right
of
representation
in
parliament
they
were
compelled
to
submit
to
unjust
land
laws
and
also
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
the
established
protestant
church
in
ireland
finally
through
the
efforts
of
gladstone
and
others
this
branch
of
the
church
was
disestablished
later
important
reforms
were
effected
in
th
eirish
land
laws
to
supplement
the
great
electoral
reforms
which
had
so
widely
extended
the
power
of
the
popular
vote
two
other
measures
were
now
carried
one
was
that
of
reform
which
opened
all
clerkships
and
similar
positions
in
the
gift
of
the
government
to
the
free
competition
of
candidates
without
regard
to
their
political
opinions
this
did
away
with
most
of
that
demoralizing
system
of
favoritism
which
makes
government
offices
the
spoils
by
which
successful
political
parties
reward
little
men
for
little
services
the
secret
ballot
another
measure
of
great
importance
followed
the
same
year
england
chiefly
through
forster
efforts
took
up
the
second
measure
the
question
of
national
education
the
conviction
gained
ground
that
if
the
working
classes
are
to
vote
then
they
must
not
be
allowed
to
remain
in
ignorance
the
nation
declared
we
must
educate
our
future
masters
in
this
spirit
a
system
of
elementary
government
schools
was
established
which
gives
instruction
to
tens
of
thousands
of
children
who
hitherto
were
forced
to
grow
up
without
its
advantages
these
schools
are
not
yet
entirely
free
although
the
legislation
of
practically
puts
most
of
them
on
that
basis

now

came
at

critical
time
asquith
the
liberal
prime
minister
was
then
demanding
that
the
veto
power
of
the
house
of
lords
should
be
limited
or
practically
abolished
so
that
in
future
the
house
of
commons
should
be
distinctly
recognized
as
the
dominant
factor
in
the
government
in
the
summer
of
asquith
succeeded
in
passing
his
veto
bill
restricting
the
power
of
the
house
of
lords
and
making
it
impossible
for
that
body
to
resist
any
measures
the
commons
should
resolutely
resolve
to
carry
he
also
passed
the
salary
bill
by
which
members
of

are
paid

great

been
assigned

appointed
commissioners
with
power

to
proceed
within

according
to
the
justice
of

against

other
dissolute
persons
joining
with

as
should
commit
any
murder
robbery
felony
mutiny
or
other
outrage
or
misdemeanour
whatsoever
and
by
such
summary
course
and
order
as
is
agreeable
to

pretext
whereof
some
of

by
some
of

put
to
death
when

where
if
by

they
had
deserved
death
by
the

also
they
might
and
by
no
other
ought
to
have
been
adjudged
and
executed
and
also
sundry
grievous
offenders
by
colour
thereof
claiming
an
exemption
have
escaped
the
punishments
due
to
them
by
the
laws
and
statutes
of
this
your
realm
by
reason
that
divers
of
your
officers
and
ministers
of
justice
have
unjustly
refused
or
forborne
to
proceed
against
such
offenders
according
to
the
same
laws
and
statutes
upon
pretence
that
the
said
offenders
were
punishable
only
by
martial
law
and
by
authority
of
such
commissions
as
aforesaid
which
commissions
and
all
other
of
like
nature
are
wholly
and
directly
contrary
to
the
said
laws

of
this
your
realm
they
do
therefore
humbly
pray
your
most
excellent
majesty
that
no
man
hereafter
be
compelled
to
make

yield
any
gift
loan
benevolence
tax
or
such

otherwise
molested

disquieted
concerning
the

or
for
refusal
thereof

that
no
freeman
in
any
such
manner
as
is
be
imprisoned
or
detained
and
that
your
majesty
will
be
pleased
to
remove
the
said
soldiers
and
mariners
and
that
your
people
may
not
be
so
burdened
in
time
to
come
and
that
the
foresaid
commissions
for
proceeding
by
martial
law
may
be
revoked

annulled
and
that
hereafter
no
commissions
of
like
nature
may
issue
forth
to
any
person
or
persons
whatsoever
to
be
executed
as
aforesaid
lest
by
colour
of
them
any
of
your

subjects
be
destroyed

put
to
death
contrary

all
which

most
humbly
pray
of

were
drawn
up
by
a
committee
of
bishops
and
barons
with
the
justiciar
or
chief
minister
at
the
head
the
object
of
the
constitutions
was
to
assert
the
supremacy
of
the
state
over
clergy
and
laity
alike
they
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
they
established
a
more
uniform
system
of
justice
and
in
certain
cases
they
provided

of

ii
bill
of
attainder
this
was
a
bill
first
used
apparently
in
passed
by
parliament
which
might
in
itself
decree
sentence
of
death
originally
the
blood
of
a
person
held
to
be
convicted
of
treason
or
felony
was
declared
to
be
or
corrupted
so
that
his
power
to
inherit
transmit
or
hold
property
was
destroyed
after
henry
viii
reign
the
law
was
modified
so
as
not
to
work
corruption
of
blood
in
the
case
of
new
felonies
under
the
stuarts
bills
of
attainder
were
generally
brought
only
in
cases
where
the
commons
believed
that
impeachment
would
fail
as
in
the
cases
of
strafford
and
laud
it
should
be
noticed
that
in
an
impeachment
the
commons
bring
the
accusation
and
the
lords
act
as
judges
but
that
in
a
bill
of
attainder
the
commons
that
is
the
accusers
themselves
act
as
judges
as
well
as
the
lords
iii
the
great
statutes
of
praemunire
this
statute
first
passed
in
was
reenacted
in
to
check
the
power
claimed
by
the
pope
in
england
in
cases
which
interfered
with
power
claimed
by
the
king
as
in
appeals
made
to
the
court
of
rome
respecting
church
matters
over
which
the
king
court
had
jurisdiction
the
statute
received
its
name
from
th
ewrit
served
on
the
party
who
had
broken
the
law
praemunire
facias
that
is
cause
to
be
forewarned
that
he
appear
before
us
to
answer
the
contempt
with
which
he
stands
charged
henry
viii
made
use
of
this
statute
in
order
to
compel
the
clergy
to
accept
his
supremacy
over
the
english
church
iv
habeas
corpus
act
the
name
of
this
celebrated
statute
is
derived
from
its
referring
to
the
opening
words
of
the
writ
habeas
corpus
ad
subjiciendum
sir
james
mackintosh
declares
that
the
essence
of
the
statute
is
contained
in
clauses
of
magna
carta
which
see
the
right
to
habeas
corpus
was
conceded
by
the
petition
of
right
and
also
by
the
statute
of
but
in
order
to
better
secure
the
liberty
of
the
subject
and
for
prevention
of
imprisonments
beyond
the
seas
the
habeas
corpus
act
of
was
enacted
regulating
the
issue
and
return
of
writs
of
habeas
corpus
the
principal
provisions
of
the
act
are
jailers
except
in
cases
of
commitment
for
treason
or
felony
must
within
three
days
of
the
reception
of
the
writ
produce
the
prisoner
in
court
unless
the
court
is
at
a
distance
when
the
time
may
be
extended
to
twenty
days
at
the
most
a
jailer
refusing
ot
do
this
forfeits
pounds
for
the
first
offence
and
pounds
for
the
second
no
one
set
at
liberty
upon
any
habeas
corpus
to
be
recommitted
for
the
same
offsense
except
by
the
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
case
the
act
not
to
apply
to
cases
of
debt
abstract
of
the
parliament
act
or
veto
act
august
the
preamble
states
that
it
is
intended
to
substitute
for
the
house
of
lords
as
it
at
present
exists
a
second
chamber
on
a
popular
instead
of
hereditary
basis
but
such
substitution
can
not
be
immediately
brought
into
operation
therefore
it
is
expedient
oto
make
such
provision
as
in
this
act
appears
for
restricting
the
existing
powers
of
the
house
of
lords
the
power
of
the
lords
to
veto
bills
sent
them
by
the

sessions
that

rejection
for
the
third
time
by

unless

to
the
contrary
become

act
