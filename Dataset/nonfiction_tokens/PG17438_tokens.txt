to
my

for
their
untiring
efforts
in
behalf
of
this
book
preface
the
influence
of
palatable
food
upon
the
health
and
general
of
the
family
is
as
certain
as
that
of
changes
of
temperature
and
more
serious
in
its
consequences
for
lasting
good
or
ill
the
sage
old
saying
tell
me
what
you
eat
and
i
will
tell
you
what
you
are
is
as
full
of
the
pith
o
sense
as
in
ye
days
of
long
ago
for
food
either
makes
us
physically
fit
and
fully
efficient
or
miserable
failures
with
physical
complications
that
keep
us
constantly
in
the
physician
hands
the
vital
essences
of
that
which
we
prepare
for
eating
are
medicinal
messengers
bearing
light
to
the
eye
vigor
to
the
limb
beauty
to
the
cheek
and
alertness
to
the
brain
as
vitamines
or
distorted
in
the
misdirected
process
are
the
harsh
heralds
of
pain
and
debility
to
the
human
system
how
great
then
is
the
influence
of
the
one
who
prepares
it
influence
according
to
astrology
was
a
power
or
virtue
flowing
from
the
planets
upon
men
and
things
but
from
the
kitchen
as
a
sun
and
heat
centre
there
truly
flows
a
planetary
influence
that
makes
or
mars
us
scientific
cooking
means
the
elimination
of
waste
the
preservation
of
edible
resources
and
conservation
of
their
potential
energy
through
the
preparation
of
attractive
vitalizing
food
with
minimum
cost
and
labor
thus
providing
in
wide
deep
measure
for
harmony
personal
comfort
and
domestic
peace
the
preface
of
a
book
is
too
often
a
flat
spiritless
excuse
for
offering
it
to
the
public
instead
of
being
a
hearty
announcement
in
welcome
terms
of
the
arrival
of
a
provision
for
a
real
need
so
i
will
come
to
the
essential
point
at
once
by
saying
that
gathered
here
in
these
pages
are
my
best
recipes
truly
tried
in
the
fire
the
actual
working
results
of
many
years
teaching
and
lecturing
brought
up
to
the
minute
in
the
interests
of
that
exacting
domestic
economy
now
as
rarely
before
imperative
in
its
demands
it
will
also
be
noted
that
the
heavy
style
is
not
used
here
but
the
recipes
are
presented
as
if
housewife
and
author
were
conversing
upon
the
dish
in
question
and
to
her
i
will
say
economical
palatable
food
is
within
your
reach
if
you
will
discard
the
ideas
and
methods
of
long
ago
remember
you
would
not
prefer
to
ride
in
a
horse
car
as
a
means
of
conveyance
so
why
use
the
recipes
of
those
days
the
capable
housewife
whose
busy
hands
bake
bread
cake
and
pastry
spreads
forth
to
the
community
an
influence
that
is
priceless
a
largesse
not
of
festal
day
holy
day
or
holiday
but
thrice
daily
wholesome
and
welcome
as
spring
first
sunbeam
and
precious
to
every
home
so
blessed
ever
growing
and
radiating
may
this
book
help
in
that
growth
and
a
greater
radiation
the
author

cook
book
bread
the
staff
of
life
must
be
palatable
and
good
if
we
are
to
be
satisfied
with
it
when
we
eat
can
you
think
of
anything
that
will
spoil
a
meal
more
quickly
than
poor
over
moist
doughy
or
heavy
bread
bread
may
truly
be
called
the
staff
of
life
as
it
will
maintain
life
longer
than
any
other
single
food
yet
many
women
think
is
a
simple
task
that
the
ingredients
can
be
thrown
together
and
good
results
obtained
or
that
any
kind
of
flour
will
make
good
bread
this
is
a
great
mistake
to
make
good
palatable
bread
it
requires
good
materials
a
reasonable
amount
of
care
and
attention
but
first
of
all
must
come
the
knowledge
of
the
flour
a
good
blend
of
hard
winter
flour
is
necessary
and
it
can
easily
be
tested
by
pressing
a
small
quantity
of
it
in
the
hand
if
the
flour
is
good
it
will
retain
the
shape
of
the
hand
graham
or
whole
wheat
flour
and
rye
flours
can
be
used
for
variety
and
to
advantage
in
making
bread
other
cereal
flours
do
not
contain
gluten
to
allow
them
to
be
used
alone
for
making
the
breads
keep
this
in
mind
and
thus
prevent
failures
the
yeast
is
a
plant
and
must
be
given
the
proper
temperature
moisture
and
food
for
its
successful
growth
when
this
is
supplied
each
little
cell
multiples
a
thousand
times
thus
pushing
and
stretching
the
dough
this
makes
it
rise
or
become
light
why
dough
falls
when
the
yeast
cells
have
absorbed
or
consumed
all
the
food
that
they
can
obtain
from
the
sugar
flour
the
dough
will
recede
or
fall
now
if
the
dough
is
carefully
handled
at
a
given
time
this
will
not
take
place
and
so
for
this
reason
the
dough
is
permitted
to
stand
only
for
a
given
length
of
time
before
it
is
worked
and
then
placed
in
the
pans
few
utensils
will
be
required
for
making
bread
but
they
must
be
scrupulously
clean
if
the
bread
is
to
have
a
good
flavor
potatoes
and
other
cooked
cereals
may
be
used
with
good
results
compressed
yeast
will
give
the
best
results
and
either
the
sponge
or
straight
dough
method
may
be
used
bread
made
by
the
sponge
method
will
require
a
longer
time
to
make
than
the
bread
that
is
made
by
the
straight
dough
method
sponge
dough
consists
of
setting
the
sponge
and
letting
it
rise
until
it
drops
back
usually
in
two
and
hours
and
then
adding
sufficient
flour
to
make
a
dough
that
can
easily
be
handled
the
straight
dough
method
consists
of
making
a
dough
at
the
start
to
make
bread
successfully
do
not
set
the
dough
over
the
range
do
not
set
it
on
the
radiators
and
do
not
place
it
where
it
will
be
in
a
draft
to
rise
cold
chills
the
dough
and
retards
the
yeast
yeast
grows
successfully
only
in
a
warm
moist
temperature
from
to
degrees
fahrenheit
dough
box
i
would
like
to
tell
the
housewife
about
a
dough
box
that
i
have
found
to
work
very
successfully
the
baker
success
in
making
bread
is
founded
on
the
fact
that
he
can
regulate
the
temperature
of
his
shop
and
thus
prevent
drafts
from
chilling
the
dough
this
box
is
just
an
ordinary
cracker
box
with
the
lid
hinged
on
it
it
is
then
lined
with
thick
asbestos
paper
on
the
inside
and
then
covered
with
oilcloth
on
the
outside
the
bowl
with
the
dough
is
then
placed
in
the
box
to
retain
its
temperature
and
to
be
free
from
drafts
while
it
rises
in
cold
weather
this
box
can
be
heated
by
placing
a
warm
iron
in
it
when
starting
to
mix
the
dough
and
then
removing
the
iron
before
placing
the
dough
in
the
box
this
box
will
easily
pay
for
the
time
and
cost
in
a
few
weeks
and
then
too
it
will
prevent
failure
now
to
get
the
proper
temperature
always
use
a
thermometer
remember
that
you
can
not
successfully
gauge
the
correct
temperature
of
liquids
that
are
used
for
making
bread
by
testing
with
the
finger
or
by
testing
them
from
the
spoon
any
plain
thermometer
that
can
be
found
in
the
house
will
do
for
this
work
scrub
it
with
soda
and
water
to
remove
the
paint
remember
in
cold
weather
to
heat
the
mixing
bowl
see
that
the
flour
is
not
lower
than
degrees
fahrenheit
all
water
or
half
water
and
milk
may
be
used
in
making
bread
when
the
milk
is
used
it
must
be
scalded
and
then
allowed
to
cool
evaporated
or
condensed
milk
does
not
require
scalding
simply
add
the
hot
water
to
acquire
the
proper
temperature
points
that
will
make
for
successful
baking
earthen
mixing
bowls
or
clean
cedar
pails
make
the
best
utensils
to
set
the
bread
dough
in
these
utensils
will
retain
the
heat
and
are
easy
to
clean
and
when
they
are
closely
covered
prevent
a
hard
crust
from
forming
on
the
dough
do
not
fail
to
give
the
dough
plenty
of
proof
that
is
let
it
rise
for
a
sufficient
length
of
time
as
given
in
the
recipes
use
a
good
grade
of
blended
flour
use
the
ball
of
the
hand
near
the
wrist
to
knead
and
work
the
dough
kneading
is
most
important
and
should
be
thoroughly
done
do
not
be
afraid
of
hurting
the
dough
you
can
handle
it
as
roughly
as
you
like
heavy
active
kneading
distributes
the
yeast
organisms
and
develops
the
elasticity
of
the
gluten
and
gives
body
and
strength
to
the
dough
now
a
word
about
the
baking
bread
is
baked
to
kill
the
fermentation
and
to
hold
the
glutinous
walls
of
the
dough
in
place
and
to
cook
the
starch
and
thus
make
it
palatable
and
easy
to
digest
an
oven
degrees
fahrenheit
is
necessary
do
not
have
it
any
hotter
than
this
too
much
heat
browns
the
loaf
before
it
has
time
to
bake
in
the
centre
salt
salt
controls
the
action
of
the
yeast
it
also
retards
or
delays
the
proper
fermentation
if
too
large
an
amount
of
it
is
used
then
again
if
not
enough
salt
is
added
to
the
mix
the
yeast
becomes
too
active
and
thus
produces
an
overlight
loaf
of
bread
one
ounce
of
salt
to
each
quart
of
liquid
in
summer
and
of
an
ounce
in
winter
will
give
the
best
results
to
the
home
baker
baking
the
bread
now
turn
on
a
moulding
board
and
cut
into
five
parts

loaves
allow
about
nineteen
ounces
to
each
loaf
take
the
dough
up
between
the
hands
and
work
into
a

place
on
the

minutes
now
with
the
palm
of
the

flatten
out
the

and
then
fold

and
then
the

method
generally
speaking
the
sponge
method
produces
a
lighter
and
whiter
loaf
than
the
bread
made
by
the
straight

method
bread
made
by
the

has
the
advantage
over

wheat

and
when

it
forms
about
per
cent
of
our
total

requirements
stale
bread
digests
much
easier
than
fresh
bread
for
the
reason
that
when
thoroughly
masticated
in
the
mouth
the
saliva
acts
directly
upon
the
starchy
content
fresh
bread
unless
thoroughly
chewed
so
that
it
may
be
well
broken
up
becomes
a
hard
pasty
ball
in
the
stomach
which
requires

oven
temperature
many
housewives
feel
that
it
is
impossible
to
secure
accurate
results
in
baking
in
the
gas
range
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
few
women
really
understand
the
principle
of
baking
with
gas
to
secure
a
slow
oven
light
both
burners
and
let
them
burn
for
five
minutes
then
turn
both
of
them
down
low
turning
the
handle
that
controls
the
flow
of
gas
off
this
will
maintain
a
steady
even

a
slow
oven
requires
to
degrees

of

a
moderate

is
to
degrees

of

it
can
be
obtained
by
burning
both
burners
of
gas
range
for
eight
minutes
and
then
turning
them
down
to
maintain
this
heat
a
hot
oven
requires
to
degrees
fahrenheit
and
will
need
to
have
the
burners
burning
twelve
minutes
and
then
turned
off
this
heat
is
intense
and
entirely
too
hot
for
breads
pastries
and
cakes
meats
require
this
heat
for
of
the
length
of
time
in
the
period
of
cooking
this
heat
is
also
necessary
for
broiling

etc
now
also
try
to
utilize
the
full
oven
space
when
baking
by
cooking
two
or
more
dishes
at
the
same
time
vegetables
may
be
placed
in
casseroles
or
earthen
dishes
or
even
ordinary
saucepans
cover
them
closely
and
cook
in
the
oven
until
tender
this
will
not
injure
other
foods
baking
in
the
oven
do
not
place
breads
cakes
and
pastries
upon
the
top
shelf
rather
place
them
on
the
lower
shelf
and
cook
in
moderate
oven
do
you
know
that
there
are
still
among
us
women
who
firmly
believe
that
placing
other
foods
to
cook
in
oven
with
cake
will
surely
spoil
it
this
is
a
mistake
utilize
every
bit
of
oven
space
an
oven
thermometer
soon
pays
for
itself
pay
strict
attention
to
heating
the
oven
if
the
oven
is
too
hot
the
heat
is
wasted
while
it
cools
sufficiently
this
wastes
gas
when
food
is
first
placed
in
the
oven
keep
oven
door
closed
for
first
ten
minutes
and
then
open
when
necessary
placing
food
in
oven
will
materially
reduce
the
heat
do
not
try
to
increase
the
heat
just
as
soon
as
the
mixture
acquires
the
heat
the
baking
will
begin
in
the
usual
manner
and
the
dish
will
be
ready
to
remove
from
oven
in
given
time
never
keep
the
oven
waiting
for
the
food
rather
let
food
remain
in
cool
place
while
oven
is
heating
before
mixing
materials
select
the
pans
that
will
best
fit
the
oven
this
does
not
mean
that
you
must
discard
your
present
equipment
it
means
that
you
should
place
in
groups
such
pans
that
entirely
fill
oven
space
without
crowding
keep
this
fact
in
mind
when
purchasing
new
utensils
the
best
and
whitest
rye
flour
is
milled
from
the
centre
of
the
grains
in
a
manner
similar
to
wheat
flour
when
only
the
bran
is
removed
from
the
milling
we
have
the
darker
flour
carrying
a
heavy
pronounced
flavor
the
rye
meal

this

delicious
for

undoubtedly
one
of
the
causes
of
the
failure
in
making
breads
at
home
is
that
the
process
is
hurried
and
the
bread
is
insufficiently
baked
the
size

shape
of
the

affect
the
quality
of
the

avoid
too
deep
or
shallow
pans
a

will
give
the

turn

it
was
left
with
just
enough
of

would
be
prepared
each

is
for
the

of
neutralizing
the
slightly
acid
flavor
of
the

a
flavor
to
which
many
folks
object
either
of

may
be
baked

now
try
this
and
save

give
the
folks
the

of
warm
water
and
set
on
the

to
heat
beat
constantly
until
the
butter
melts
and
produces
a
creamy
mix
stale
bread
may
be
crumbled
or
soaked
in
cold
water
pressed
dry
and
used
in
place
of
rice
or
cornmeal
so
may
oatmeal
or
other
leftover
breakfast
cereals
as
well
as
mashed
potatoes
be
used
reserve
about
one
cupful
of
the
yeast
batter
to
start
the
next

use
this
starter
in

renew
the

mix
every
fifth

may
not
come
amiss
the

in

pan
put
the

well
into
the
corners
and
leave
a
slight
depression
in

this
will
leave
the
cake
perfectly
smooth
on

now
if
the
oven
is
too
cool
when
the

go
into
it
the
cake
will
rise
over
the
top
of
the
pans
and
become
while
on
the
other
hand
if
it
is
too
hot
it
will
brown
quickly
on
the
top
before
the
cake
has
had
a
chance
to
rise
then
when
the
dough
does
attempt
to
rise
it
will
break
through
and
crack
the
crust
too
much
flour
will
also
cause
this
now
to
break
the
old
hoodoos
about
you
may
look
at
the
cake
after
it
is
in
the
oven
ten
minutes
if
you
will
open

shut

door
gently
and
if
necessary
to
remove
the

wait
until
it
has
reached
its
full
height
and
is
beginning
to
brown
then
it
may
be
removed
carefully
without
danger
of
falling
sometimes
it
may
be
necessary
to
remove
the

so
that
they
may
brown
evenly

pastry
now
it
all
rests
with
the
cook
as
to
whether
we
are
going
to
have
a
cut
of
pastry
that
fairly
melts
in
your
mouth
or
a
tough
doughy
mass
that
is
unfit
for
food
any
little
housewife
may
turn
out
delicious
flaky
pastry
if
she
will
but
follow
directions
carefully
first
of
all
let
us
study
for
a
minute
just
what
pastry
is
it
is
a
mixture
of
flour
shortening
and
water
each
grain
of
flour
is
thoroughly
coated
with
shortening
and
then
mixed
to
a
dough
with
the
water
do
i
hear
you
say
well
i
know
that
surely
you
do
but
do
you
know
the
real
knack
of
putting
it
together
for
here
is
the
real
rub
the
minute
you
knead
or
squeeze
pastry
that
is
the
moment
you
make
it
tough
the
real
secret
sift
three
cups
of
flour
one
teaspoon
of
salt
three
teaspoons
of
baking
powder
together
twice
and
then
cut
or
rub
into
this
cup
of
shortening
if
you
cut
it
in
use
your
turner
or
spatula
and
chop
it
in
rather
coarse
now
mix
to
a
dough
with
cup
of
water
using
the
to
mix
the
water
in
just
keep
chopping
and
turning
over
until
the
mixture
is
formed
into
a
ball
of
dough
do
not
knead
or
pat
with
the
hand
you
can
not
hurt
this
dough
if
you
will
just
mix
it
as
a
man
does
when
mixing
mortar
with
a
hoe
keep
working
it
back
and
forth
chopping
it
each
time
until
well
mixed
this
amount
will
make
the
tops
and
the
bottoms
for
two
pies
to
roll
the
dough
divide
it
into
four
parts
and
then
lift
one
piece
on
a
slightly
floured
board
and
roll
out
the
dough
working
the
rolling
pin
to
and
from
you
and
turning
the
dough
as
often
as
necessary
to
secure
the
size
and
shape
desired
should
the
dough
tear
or
not
come
to
the
desired
shape
just
fold
it
into
squares
or
oblongs
and
then
roll
again
place
on
the
tin
and
then
trim
the
edges
proceed
in
the
same
manner
with
the
top
crust
and
then
when
ready
to
place
on
the
pie
fold
from
corner
to
corner
making
a
bias
fold
and
then
cut
gashes
with
a
knife
in
centre
to
allow
steam
to
escape
lift
and
cover
the
pie
and
then
trim
to
shape
now
do
not
form
the
trimmings
into
a
ball
but
lay
them
one
piece
upon
the
other
in
a
pile
and
flatten
them
with
the
rolling
pin
roll
and
fold
into
shape
and
roll
as
desired
you
can
pastry
as
often
as
desired
by
this
method
keep
in
the
mind
the
fact
that
kneading
or
squeezing
the
pastry
forms
it
into
a
sticky
mass
this
method
will
give
you
a
delicious
flaky
crust
you
may
spread
two
tablespoons
of
shortening
upon
the
top
crust
and
then
fold
and
roll
fold
again
and
roll
then
use
as
desired
sufficient
pastry
may
be
made
at
one
time
to
last
for
two
or
three
days
just
wrap
the
dough
in
so
that
it
does
not
dry
out
various
fillings
may
be
used
fresh
or
canned
fruits
custards
mince
meat
etc
if
you
use
fresh
fruits
place
cup
of
sugar
three
level
tablespoons
of
cornstarch
in
a
bowl
and
rub
between
the
hands
to
thoroughly
mix
and
then
use
this
by
sprinkling
over
the
fruit
this
will
prevent
the
juice
from
boiling
out
of
the
pie
while
it
is
cooking
and
it
will
form
into
a
jelly
when
cold
to
use
canned
fruit
drain
the
fruit
free
from
the
liquid
and
then
cut
into
thin
slices
measure
the
liquid
and
then
add
four
level
tablespoons
of
cornstarch
eight
tablespoons
of
sugar
to
each
cupful
dissolve
the
starch
and
sugar
in
the
cold
liquid
and
then
bring
to
a
boil
cook
for
three
minutes
and
then
add
the
prepared
fruit
cool
before
placing
in
the
pastry
to
prevent
the
lower
crust
from
becoming
soggy
just
before
putting
in
the
filling
brush
it
well
with
a
good
salad
oil
or
shortening
taking
care
that
each
part
is
covered
this
will
give
you
a
tender
flaky
lower
crust
just
before
the
pie
is
ready
to
put
into
the
oven
brush
it
well
with
a
wash
of
egg
and
milk
using
yolk
of
one
egg
cup
of
milk
two
teaspoons
of
sugar
stir
to
dissolve
the
sugar
and
mix
in
the
egg
then
wash
the
pie
this
will
keep
a
week
in
a
cool
place
the
correct
temperature
to
bake
a
pie
is
to
degrees
fahrenheit
this
means
a
moderate
oven
too
much
heat
will
brown
the
crust
before
the
filling
inside
has
had
the
time
to
cook

pastry
for
custard
pie
the
most
important
point
in
the
custard
pie
is
the
crust
which
will
either
make
or
mar
the
pie
so
to
begin
with
the
pastry
should
be
light
and
delicate
to
make
pastry
for
custard
pie
place
in
a
bowl
three
cups
of
flour
one
teaspoon
of
salt
three
teaspoons
of
baking
powder
two
tablespoons
of
sugar
sift
to
mix
and
then
rub
in
cup
of
good
shortening
and
then
mix
to
a
dough
with
cup
of
ice
water
when
mixing
the
pastry
to
a
dough
it
is
important
that
it
should
be
cut
and
folded
together
much
after
the
method
used
in
cutting
and
folding
the
whites
into
a
cake
care
at
this
point
in
making
the
pastry
will
prevent
it
from
becoming
tough
now
wrap
the
pastry
in
wax
or
parchment
paper
and
place
on
the
ice
to
thoroughly
chill
for
two
hours
now
if
the
pastry
is
made
either
the
day
before
or
early
in
the
morning
and
then
allowed
to
blend
it
will
be
delightfully
light
and
flaky
now
to
prepare
for
the
pie
this
amount
of
pastry
will
be
sufficient
for
two
large
pies
one
custard
and
one
lemon
for
variety
the
trimmings
can
be
made
into
little
tarts
turnovers
or
cheese
straws
divide
the
pastry
into
two
parts
and
then
roll
out
one
part
on
a
lightly
floured
board
until
sufficiently
large
to
fully
cover
the
pie
tin
now
fold
carefully
in
half
and
then
in
quarters
and
lift
on
the
pie
plate
and
open
covering
the
pie
plate
easing
on
the
pastry
trim
the
edges
and
then
roll
out
the
trimmings
into
a
long
narrow
strip
cut
into
strips
inch
wide
and
then
brush
the
edge
of
the
pastry
on
the
pie
plate
with
water
and
add
this
narrow
strip
as
a
reinforcement
to
build
up
the
edge
this
will
prevent
the
custard
overflowing
now
brush
the
pastry
in
the
bottom
of
the
pie
plate
with
melted
shortening
taking
care
to
thoroughly
coat
the
entire
surface
with
the
shortening
then
pour
in
the
prepared
custard
reserve
about
one
tablespoon
of
the
custard
to
brush
the
pastry
around
the
edges
place
in
a
slow
oven
and
bake
until
the
custard
is
firm
in
the
centre
to
test
if
custard
is
baked
gently
insert
a
silver
knife
into
the
custard
taking
care
that
the
knife
does
not
pierce
the
crust
brushing
the
pastry
with
the
shortening
before
pouring
in
the
custard
prevents
the
moisture
from
soaking
into
the
crust
to
make
the
meringue
beat
the
whites
of
two
eggs
in
a
bowl
which
is
free
from
grease
until
stiff
and
then
cut
and
fold

the
stiffly
beaten
whites
of
the
two
eggs
cup
of
pulverized
sugar
three
tablespoons
of
cornstarch
sift
the
sugar
and
cornstarch
to
thoroughly
mix
and
then
carefully
cut
and
fold
into
the
whites
of
eggs
on
just
how
careful
you
are
in
cutting
and
folding
this
mixture
will
determine
the
success
of
your
meringues
after
the
whites
are
beaten
stiff
they
are
full
of
little
air
bubbles
which
if
stirred
break
down
and
become
watery
and
then
the
entire
mixture
becomes
flat
and
tough
to
prevent
this
sprinkle
the
prepared
sugar
over
the
stiffly
beaten
white
of
egg
and
then
with
a
spoon
cut
down
through
the
centre
and

to

the

there
is
every
reason
why
rice
should
be
a
daily
article
of
diet
in
planning
the
menu
it
is
more
nutritious
than
the

and
it
digests
more
readily
when
properly
cooked

the

the

which
removes

third
the

which
so
many
folks
think
is
very
desirable
polished
rice
has
been
robbed
of
nearly
all
its
fat
and
mineral
content
and
thus
its
food
value
is
lowered
and
it
is
deprived
of
its
flavor
the
rice

as
prepared
in
the
oriental
countries
are
made
from
fancy
unpolished

they

the
oriental
first
washes
his
rice
in
several
waters
rubbing
it
vigorously
between
the
hands
this
thoroughly
cleanses
it
now
to
follow
this
method
have
a
saucepan
containing
boiling
water
and
then
add
the
rice
slowly
so
that
the
water
continually
boils
cook
until
tender
and
then
remove
the
lid
from
the
saucepan
and
cover
the
rice
with
a
cloth
to
absorb
the
moisture
set
in
a
warm
place
for
five
minutes
this
will
give
the
saucepan
containing
a
mass
of
delicious
fluffy
rice
each
grain
distinct
and
separate
now
if
you
carefully
measure
both
your
rice
and
then

it
will
not
be
necessary
for
you
to
drain
off
the
excess
water
and
thus
lose
the
valuable
mineral
and
fat
content

the

the

who

the

the
true
secret
for

article
of

the
old
mammy
in
new
orleans
always
tells
her
children
that
of
course
le
riz
must
be
thoroughly
washed
and
she
always
insists
that
the
grains
be
cleansed
in
four
waters
two
warm
and
two
cold
and
then
it
is
cooked
in
the
same
manner
as
the
orientals
use
never
stir
the
rice
while
it
is
cooking
this
will
make
it
mushy
instead
always
shake
the
never
flood
the
rice
with
water
while
it
is
cooking
always
keep
the
fact
in
mind
that
just
five
times
the
actual
measurements
of
the
rice
in
water
will
be
required
to
cook
it
in
this
way
there
will
be
no
excess
water
to
drain
off
so
if
you
are
using
cup
of
rice
you
would
use
one
and
cups
of
water
now
you
can
not
pile
up

you

when

meats
use
oven
for
baking
and
boiling
and
then
cook
your
meats
in
the
english
way
by
direct
contact
with
the
flame
this
means
that
you
must
first
place
one
quart
of
water
and
one
tablespoon
of
salt
in
the
broiler
pan
of
the
gas
range
then
place
in
the
roast
steak
or
chops
upon
the
broiler
turn
every
few
minutes
the
roast
must
be
placed
farther
from
the
flame
to
prevent
burning
a
good
rule
for
this
is
to
keep
roasting
meat
four
inches
from
the
flame
steaks
and
chops
two
and
inches
and
fish
three
inches
the
placing
of
water
in
the
broiler
pan
prevents
fat
from
catching
fire
this
liquid
may
be
allowed
to
cool
and
then
the
fat
may
be
removed
and
clarified
and
used
for
other
purposes

boiling
water
while
cooking
roasting
and
baking
meats
roasting
or
grilling
is
done
before
open
fire
the
meat
being
turned
frequently
so
that
all
sides
may
be
cooked
alike
the
meat
is
basted
with
its
own
fat
this
method
of
cooking
meat
is
used
daily
in
europe
but
not
much
used
in
this
country
when
a
piece
of
meat
is
large
it
is
roasted
meat
cooked
in
an
oven
by
radiated
heat
is
frequently
called
in
this
country
roasting
it
is
well
known
and
needs
little
description
when
baking
meat
always
use
a
wire
rack
to
lift
the
meat
from
the
bottom
of
the
pan
this
will
insure
even
cooking
use
the
broiling
oven
in
the
gas
range
for
roasting
placing
rack
sufficiently
low
have
the
oven
hot
enough
to
brown
the
meat
quickly
then
reduce
the
heat
so
that
it
will
cook
evenly
turn
the
roast
three
times
during
this
process
allow
an
hour
after
placing
meat
in
the
oven
before
counting
time
this
is
necessary
so
that
the
meat
may
reach
the
required
temperature
to
start
cooking
to
bake
oven
roast
use
same
process
using
regular
oven
start
counting
time
after
meat
is
hour
in
oven
and
allow
twelve
minutes
to
the
pound
for
very
rare
fifteen
minutes
for
rare
eighteen
minutes
for
medium
and
twenty
for
well
done
baste
the
meat
with
the
liquid
in
the
pan
every
fifteen
minutes
do
not
add
seasoning
to
the
meat
while
cooking
it
is
a
fact
that
salt
will
cause
the
juices
and
flavoring
of
the
meat
to
dissolve
and
therefore
become
lost
season

meat
on

the
contact

will
injure

chops

are
served
upon
platters
set
over

always
have

chilling
correct
method
of
boiling
meat
place
the

in
a
saucepan
of
boiling
water
and
then
keep
the
water
boiling
rapidly
for
five
minutes
after
the
meat
is
added
then
place
the
saucepan
in
a
position
where
it
will
cook
just
below
the
boiling
point
for
the
required
length
of
time
constant
and
rapid
boiling
will
cause
the
albumen
in
the
meat
to
harden
therefore
no
amount
of
cooking
afterward
will
soften
the
fibre
it
will
only
cause
the
meat
to
fall
apart
without
being
tender
it
is
important
to
keep
the
saucepan
closely
covered
this
will
prevent
the
delicate
aroma
from

broiling

is
necessary
for

only
the
choicest
tenderest
and
most
delicate
cuts
are
suitable
for
cooking
by
this
method
the
strong
heat
instantly
coagulates
the
albumen
by
searing
it
thus
retaining
all
its
juices
and
flavor
that
this
method
may
be
successful
it
is
very
necessary
that
the
meat
be
turned
every

this
also
insures
it

appetizers
the
appetizer
is
a
small
morsel
of
food
served
at
the
beginning
of
the

causes
a

of
digestive
juice

thus

many
housewives
have
the
impression
that
the
preparation
of
the
delicious
accessories
of
the
cosmopolitan
meal
is
expensive
well
i
hardly
need
tell
you
that
the
french
housewife
is
noted
for
her
thrift
and
that
these
dainty
tidbits
are
frequently
portions
of
leftovers
from
a
meal
sometimes
the
scrapings
of
a
saucepan
or
a
tablespoon
of
meat
vegetables
and
gravy
have
you
ever
had
just
a
small
piece
of
fish
left
over
entirely
too
small
to
serve
by
itself
and
rather
than
leave
it
on
a
plate
or
saucer
to
form
an
accumulation
you
think
well
i
ca
use
it
so
into
the
garbage
it
goes
now
this
tablespoon
or
two
of
fish
would
have
made
you
a
few
delicious
canapés
by
flaking
it
and
then
putting
it
through
a
sieve
place
it
on
a
platter
and
then
add
two
tablespoons
of
butter
one
teaspoon
of
paprika
one
tablespoon
of
grated

one
tablespoon

of

the
canapé
though
it
bears
a
foreign
name
is
not
necessarily
an
expensive
addition
to
the
menu
for
the
family
nor
is
it
elaborate
this
delectable
morsel
is
rather
dainty
delicate
and
used
as
an
appetizer
that
helps
to
start
and
stimulate
the
digestive
juices
and
thus
cause
them
to
flow
freely
for
the
digestion
of
the
food
canapés
are
usually
served
cold

a
plate
covered
with
a
doily
the

is

need
not

be

it
may
be

how
to

leftover

so
there

no
actual

has
perplexed
many
young

and
as
one

writes
me
i
try
to
keep
down
the
leftovers
but
every
once
in
so
often
they
just
rise
up

conquer
me
every
housewife
knows
that
no
matter
how
carefully
she
plans
there
is
sure
to
be
a
small
quantity
of
leftover
meat
gravy
or
vegetables
and
just
what
to
do
with
them
is
almost
a
daily
problem
two
essentials
are
necessary
to
successfully
utilize
leftovers
first
good
seasoning
second
attractive
appearance
the
french
excel
in
serving
leftovers
because
they
so
thoroughly
understand
the
art
of
flavoring
and
seasoning
the
french
housewife
knows
very
well
that
she
may
only
have
a
au
to
serve
to
the
family
but
the
family
knows
that
the
delicate
attractive
manner
in
which
the
food
is
put
on
the
table
would
appeal
to
the
epicure
though
the
table
is

become

she

american
persons
know
of
the
garlic
but
as
a
rank
pungent
flavor
to
the
foreigner
garlic
is
as
sweet
tasting
as
the
onion
and
its
flavor
delightful
in
food
just
that
dash
that
it
needs
to
give
it
zest
separate
a
clump
of
garlic
into
cloves
and
then
peel
and
place
in
a
fruit
jar
now
bring
one
pint
of
white
wine
vinegar
to
the
scalding
point
and
then
pour
it
over
the
garlic
place
on
the
cover
and
set
in
a
warm
place
for
two
days
use
this
vinegar
for
seasoning
gravies
and
use
the
garlic
cut
into
tiny
bits
the
size
of
a
pinhead
for
flavoring
for
serving
use
individual
ramekin
casseroles
baking
shells
and
thus
make
for
efficient
and
quick
handling
of
the
food
in
which
the
food
itself
is
presented
in
a
most
attractive
way
a
good
blend
of
seasoning
is
most
important
so
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
french
housewife
secret
mince
four
onions
very
fine
then
place
in
a
bowl
and
add
six
tablespoons
of
salt
two
teaspoons
of
paprika
teaspoon
of
thyme
teaspoon
of
sweet
marjoram
teaspoon
of
sage
pinch
of
cloves
pinch
of
allspice
rub
together
until
thoroughly
mixed
and
then
put
in
a
warm
dry
place
for
hours
put
through
a
fine
sieve
place
in
a
bottle
and
use
one
teaspoon
of
this
mixture
in
place
of
salt
the
average
housewife
seldom
thinks
of
using
such
herbs
as
sweet
basil
sorrel
tarragon
leek
and
chervil
yet
they
give
a
delicious
flavoring
not
only
to
soups
stews
ragouts
and
goulashes
but
to
made
dishes
they
can
be
grown
in
the
kitchen
garden
a
good
sauce
is
important
and
not
only
increases
the
portion
but
also
gives
it
an
attractive
appearance
leftover
meats
and
vegetables
may
be
turned
into
palatable
food
with
just
a
little
time
and
energy
the
basis
of
all
croquettes
should
be
a
good
thick
moulding
sauce
that
will
give
a
product
that
is
creamy
and
delicious
to
taste
owing
to
the
fact
that
croquettes
and
cutlets
are
usually
fried
in
hot
fat
it
is
not
necessary
to
add
either
shortening
or
butter
to
the
cream
sauce
the
true
secret
to
good
croquettes
or
cutlets
is
to
have
the
mixture
rich
and
creamy
mould
into
croquettes
and
then
dip
in
flour
and
then
in
the
egg
mixture
and

fats
fat
is
a
food
which
is
very
valuable
in
cold
weather
for
supplying
the
body
with
heat
and
energy
often
foods
that
are
cooked
in
fat
are
termed
indigestible
this
means
that
the
food
is
not
utilized
in
the
body
and
owing
to
some
digestive
disturbances
it
becomes
part
of
the
waste
recent
experiments
tend
to
show
that
animal
fats
are
assimilated
fairly
well
undoubtedly
it
is
the
misuse
of
fat
that
is
used
for
frying
purposes
that
has
given
many
fried
foods
their
bad
reputation
every
normal
person
requires
a
certain
amount
of
fat
make
it
a
rule
when
serving
fried
food
to
have
an
acid
food
either
a
vegetable
or
a
garnish
accompany
the
dish
here
are
just
a
few
things
to
keep
in
mind
when
planning
to
serve
fried
foods
use
very
small
quantities
of
foods
that
are
cooked
in
fat
for
people
occupying
sedentary
positions
while
those
who
are
employed
in
active
or
laborious
work
may
eat
a
larger
proportion
persons
who
are
working
at
hard
manual
labor
out
of
doors
will
be
able
to
assimilate
daily
portions
of
fried
food
without
any
physical
disturbances
for
digestion
sake
learn
to
serve
juice
of
lemon
with
fried
fish
apple
sauce
with
pork
or
goose
cranberry
or
currant
jelly
with
poultry
lamb
or
mutton
horseradish
with

it
is
a
curious
thing
that
nature
demands
these
combinations
to
equalize
the
fatty
content
of
the
meal
save
and
clarify
the
various
fats
and
utilize
each
particular
kind
so
that
there
need
be
no

rendered
in
this
way
an
excellent
shortening
that
may
be
used
to
replace
butter
in
cooking
and
baking
may
be
made
from
chicken
fat
of
which
there
is
usually
three
or
more
ounces
in
one
fat
bird
remove
the
fat
from
the

then
drain

small
pieces
render

now
when
using
this

use
less
than
the
amount
called
for
in

recipe
to
make

allow
four
tablespoonfuls
of
this
chicken
fat
to
each
cup
of

chicken
fat
may
be
used
to
replace
butter
for

mashed
potatoes
this
is
a
pure
fat
free
from
moisture
and
seasoning
and
will
go
farther
than
butter
generally
in
speaking
of
the
term
drippings
it
meant
to
include
fats
that
cook
out
from
the
roast
beef
pot

this
fat
is
clarified
and
then
used

it
can
not
be
used
with
good
results
for
making
pastry
and
cakes
to
clarify

put
the
fat
in
a
saucepan
and
add
one
cupful
of
cold

fats
that
are
not

use
should
be
collected
and
made

do
not
be
falsely
economical
in
trying
to
do
deep
frying
with
these
fats
they
not
only
will
not
hold
the
temperature
for
successful
frying
without
scorching
but
they
frequently
soak
into
the
food
and
make
it
unfit
to
eat
the
late
war
has
brought
many
good
vegetable
oils
upon
the
market
that
are
ideal
for
cooking
purposes
and
are
preferable
to
the
animal
fats
for
all
cooking
they
not
only
hold
a
high
temperature
without
burning
but
also
they
may
be
used
repeatedly
if
they
are
strained
each
time
after
using
food
cooked
in
vegetable
oil
does
not
absorb
the
fat
and
it
is
more
digestible
and
really
more
economical
frying
there
are
two
methods
of
frying
sautéing
cooking
food
in
the
pan
with
just
sufficient
fat
to
prevent
scorching
this
method
is
commonly
used
but
has
nothing
to
really
recommend
it
as
the
food
absorbs
quantities
of
grease
this
makes
it
difficult
to
digest
frying
it
is
usual
to
dip
the
food
to
be
fried
in
a
mixture
to
coat
it
and
then
to
roll
it
in
fine
bread
crumbs
and
then
cook
in
sufficient
fat
to
cover
this
forms
an
cover
that
prevents
the
grease
from
soaking
through
a
few
essential
utensils
are
necessary
to
produce
successful
results
first
a
heavy
kettle
that
will
not
tilt
and
second
a
frying
basket
so
that
the
food
may
be
removed
quickly
when
cooked
the
correct
temperature
for
frying
is
degrees
fahrenheit
for
raw
foods
such
as
crullers
fish
fritters
potatoes
etc
for
cooked
dishes
and
oysters
cheeseballs
degrees
fahrenheit
do
not
attempt
to
cook
large
quantities
at
one
time
this
will
cause
a
sudden
drop
in
the
temperature
of
the
fat
allowing
it
to
permeate
the
food
which
is
cooking
and
thus
give
a
greasy
product
now
for
a
word
of
protection
do
not
use
too
large
a
kettle
keep
a
bucket
of
sand
handy
in
the
kitchen
and
if
for
any
reason
the
fat
catches
fire
throw
sand
on
it
do
not
attempt
to
remove
it
from
the
stove
serious
burns
are
apt
to
result
just
turn
out
the
light
and
throw
sand
on
the
fire
keep
the
fact
in
mind
that
water
spreads
the
flames
if
no
sand
is
at
hand
use
salt
or
flour

artichokes
the
artichoke
is
a
plant
closely
resembling
the
thistle
and
it
is
extensively
cultivated
for
its
flowering
head
the
head
is
gathered
just
before
the
flower
expands
the
eatable
portion
is
the
fleshy
part
of
the
calyx
the
bottom
or
basin
of
the
blossom
and
the
true
base
of
the
leaves
of
the
flower
the
flesh
of
the
artichokes
correspond
closely
to
that
which
the
old
world
folks
call
the
cheese
of
the
thistle
on
the
continent
in
europe
the
artichoke
is
frequently
served
raw
as
a
salad
with
either
french
or
parisian
dressing
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
fruit
as
prepared
for
market
will
keep
several
weeks
the
canned
artichoke
which
was
imported
quite
extensively
before
the
war
consisted
of
the
fronds
and
bottoms
it
came
in
large
quantities
from
both
france
and
italy
the
artichoke
buds
are
used
exclusively
for
garnishing
the
jerusalem
artichoke
this
kind
of
artichoke
is
a
tuber
of
the
species
of
the
sunflower
it
resembles
somewhat
the
irish
potato
it
has
a
sweetish
flavor
and
contains
a
large
amount
of
natural
water
this
species
of
artichoke
is
more
valuable
than
the
common
artichoke
the
two
principal
types
of
the
jerusalem
artichokes
are
first
long
with
reddish
skin
second
round
knobby
and
white
in
color
on
the
continent
they
are
frequently
eaten
raw
with
just
a
plain
seasoning
of
salt
pepper
and
vinegar
in
fact
much
as
we
eat
the
american
radish
they
are
frequently
made
into
soup
the
word
jerusalem
is
a
queer
cross
of
dialect
from
the
italian
word
meaning
sunflower
to

soup
soup
unless
it
is
a
thick
cream
or
puree
contains
little
food
value
rather
it
is
stimulating
to
the
stomach
and
causes
a
free
flow
of
the
digestive
juices
thus
the
food
taken
in
after
the
soup
has
stimulated
the
stomach
is
quickly
absorbed
and
thus
gives
the
body
immediate
nourishment
without
distressing
the
digestion
the
french
lay
great
stress
upon
two
essentials
in
making
soup
successfully
first
it
must
not
go
below
the
boiling
point
just
a
gentle
bubbling
and
second
after
once
started
no
water
should
be
added
in
making
soup
always
use
cold
water
to
start
with
do
not
use
salt
or
any
seasoning
and
heat
slowly
keeping
the
pot
closely
covered
protein
which
is
the
chief
constituent
of
meat
is
drawn
into
the
liquid
making
it
very
nutritious
rapid
boiling
destroys
the
fine
aroma
and
volatile
oils
which
escape
in
the
steam
soups
are
divided
into
three
classes
first
stock
second
cream
third
fruit
soups
soups
made
from
meat
and
bone
are
called
stock
those
without
stock
are
called
cream
such
as
cream
vegetable
clam
and
oyster
soups
and
lastly
those
made
from
meat
and
bones
cooked
by
long
and
slow
boiling
which
dissolves
the
soluble
elements
of
the
meat
and
bones
into
the
water
and
makes
a
very
rich
soup
the
stock
pot
this
should
be
a
deep
pot
or
kettle
with
a
lid
this
is
important
so
that
none
of
the
steam
may
be
lost
by
evaporation
the
steam
contains
the
aroma
or
fine
volatile
oil
and
essentials
which
pass
into
the
air
in
a
fairly
large
family
little
meat
need
be
purchased
for
the
stock
pot
if
the
housewife
insists
that
all
portions
of
bone
and
trimming
be
sent
with
the
purchased
meat
the
french
women
look
with
horror
on
the
american
women
leaving
all
the
scrap
and
trimming
to
the
butcher
to
make
the
stock
a
soup
bone
from
the
shin
beef
which
is
full
of
nutriment
will
have
nearly
pound
of
meat
on
it
take
one
pound
of
the
scrag
end
of
the
neck
of
veal
and
four
quarts
of
water
wash
the
bones
and
add
the
cold
water
and
bring
slowly
to
a
boil
skim
and
then
cover
closely
and
cook
for
four
hours
by
this
time
the
meat
will
have
fallen
from
the
bones
strain
and
set
aside
to
cool
let
stand
overnight
this
is
best
then
remove
all
fat
from
the
top
this
stock
is
the
basis
of
all
soups
sauces
and
gravies
it
is
rich
in
mineral
matter
and
gelatine
the
meat
can
be
taken
from
the
bones
and
run
through
the
food
chopper
and
used
for
meat
loaf
croquettes
and
meat
biscuits
or
sausage
and
it
will
make
mighty
tasty
hash
when
combined
with
potatoes
and
onions
for
breakfast
you
now
have
a
delicious
and
nutritious
broth
without
seasoning
of
any
kind
which
will
keep
in
cold
weather
four
or
five
days
in
warm
weather
it
must
be
returned
every
second
day
to
the
pot
brought
to
a
boil
and
skimmed
and
then
left
to
cool
and
finally
put
in
the
ice
box
small
portions
of
meat
ham
any
trimming
and
bones
that
have
accumulated
may
be
added
chicken

have
drawn
out
by

with
which
to
extract
meat
juices
and
flavors
fourth
long
slow

fifth
flavoring
and
vegetables
added
after

will

the

this
will
require
from
six

twelve
hours
depending
entirely
upon
the
dryness
of

be

that
the
water
covers
the

one
inch
now
when

is
ready
add

to
sweeten
and
place
in

the
slower
this

fresh
fruit
as

potatoes
this
nutritious
tuber
is
said
to
have
saved
the
irish
people
from
famine
and
it
is
fitting
that
this
variety
of
potato
should
bear
that
name
the
potato
was
unknown
to
europe
before
the
venturesome
expedition
of
the
fifteenth
century
to
the
americas
where
it
was
found
to
be
used
freely
by
the
natives
of
both
continents
frequently
it
has
been
said
that
the
potato
competes
with
bread
as
the
staff
of
life
because
its
use
is
almost
universal
there
are
more
than
varieties
of
potato
and
although
it
is
affected
by
soil
and
climate
the
sandy
soil
necessary
for
its
successful
growth
is
found
in
almost
every
country
the
housewife
should
understand
its
food
value
the
average
analysis
of
the
white
potato
is
as
follows
per
cent
water
per
cent
protein
per
cent
fat
per
cent
carbohydrates
starch
and
sugar
per
cent
waste
and
per
cent
mineral
ash
the
proportion
of
water
found
in
the
potato
depends
largely
upon
the
soil
in
which
it
is
grown
the
small
protein
content
is
offset
by
its
large
carbohydrates
starch
and
sugar
content

potato
dishes
one
of
the
best
forms
of
serving
this
tuber
is
to
roast
the
potato
in
the
ashes
few
will
realize
how
delicious
it
can
be
wrap
the
potato
in
wax
paper

then
cover

coals

then
rub
well
with

and
place
in
the
oven
and
bake
for
minutes
for
small
potatoes
and
fifty
minutes
to
one
hour
for
large
ones
greasing
the
potato
well
before
baking
prevents
a
hard
crust
from
forming
and
permits
the
entire
contents
of
the
mealy
sack
to
be
eaten
boiling
potatoes
in
their
jackets
causes
the
potato
to
lose
about
per
cent
of
its
nutritive
value
while
peeling
before
cooking
causes
a
loss
of
per

if
necessary
to
peel

measurements
many
women
are
familiar
with
the
importance
of
accurate
measurements
in
preparing
foods
others
frequently
complain
of
the
troubles
they
have
with
recipes
but
what
they
actually
need
to
know
is
that
we
no
longer
live
in
the
days
of
cents
a
dozen
for
fresh
eggs
and
that
the
day
of
thirty
cents
per
pound
for
creamery
butter
of
excellent
quality
is
past
gone
are
the
days
of
plenty
when
the
extravagant
cook
was
the
best
cook
banish
all
recipes
that
call
for
cups
of
butter
from
motives
of
real
practical
economy
we
now
use
level
measurements
that
means
that
you
first
sift
your
flour
into
a
bowl
and
then
fill
the
measure
using
a
spoon
to
fill
with
and
then
level
the
top
of
the
measure
with
a
knife
level
measurement
means
all
that
lies
below
the
edge
of
the
cup
or
spoon
the
experienced
cook
with
an
eye
for
measurements
can
gauge
the
amounts
very
frequently
to
a
nicety
while
she
may
sometimes
have
a
failure
she
will
never
attribute
it
to
her
measure
or
the
method
of
compounding
the
ingredients
oftentimes
she
will
blame
the
flour
the
baking
powder
or
even
the
oven
one
woman
wrote
me
that
she
wished
to
know
what
the
trouble
was
with
her
cakes
i
asked
her
to
give
the
recipe
and
she
answered
that
she
generally
used
a
bowl
for
measuring
and
that
then
she
used
sugar
eggs
butter
flour
and
enough
milk
or
water
to
make
a
batter
there
was
no
real
definite
amounts
when
i
replied
i
told
her
that
it
was
the
measurements
and
methods
that
she
used
that
frequently
caused
a
failure
but
she
was
sure
that
was
not
the
case
for
her
cake
was
usually
good
and
it
was
only
once
in
a
while
that
she
had
a
failure
so
i
had
quite
a
time
convincing
her
that
accurate
measurements
will
always
give
the
same
results
and
assured
success
and
that
she
could
bake
the
same
cake
days
in
the
year
and
not
once
have
a
failure
this
woman
would
not
return
to
the
old
way
of
doing
her
cooking
and
recently
i
had
a
little
note
from
her
telling
me
to
let
the
other
and
young
housewives
too
know
how
necessary
it
is
to
be
accurate
you
know
it
only
takes
a
few
minutes
longer
to
measure
accurately
and
then
you
are
able
to
make
that
delicious
cake
without
a
failure
no
failures
no
waste
truly
the
words
of
trusting
to
luck
should
be
taboo
in
the
efficient
woman
kitchen
the
temptation
to
add
just
a
little
more
sugar
flour
or
shortening
to
a
recipe
with
the
idea
of
improving
it
must
be
eliminated
if
you
wish
to
cook
successfully
when
using
vegetable
oil
in
place
of
butter
in
making
cakes
cut
down
the
quantity
of
fat
fully
many
cake
recipes
contain
too
much
fat
when
the
amounts
are
less
than
one
cup
frequently
it
is
easier
to
measure
with
a
spoon
remember
all
measures
are
level
sixteen
tablespoons

eight
tablespoons

four
tablespoons

five
tablespoons
plus
one

sift
the

before
measuring
standard
measuring
cups
holding
pint
are
divided
on
one
side
into
quarters
and
on
the
other
side
into
thirds
and
they
are
usually
found
in
all
housefurnishing
stores
and
there
is
a
choice
of
aluminum
glass
or
tin
sets
of
measuring
spoons
will
save
time
and
trouble
the
spoons
graduate
from
of
a
teaspoon
to
one
tablespoon
thus
making
accurate
measurements
for
seasoning
and
flavoring
a
spatula
will
repay
its
cost
many
times
over
the
first
month
it
is
used
it
is
possible
with
this
knife
to
remove
every
particle
of
food
from
a
mixing
bowl
how
can
you
keep
a
house
without
a
pair
of
reliable
scales
do
you
know
how
much
the
chicken
weighed
that
you
bought
on
saturday
and
do
you
know
how
much
waste
there
was
or
the
weight
of
the
bone
in
the
meat
that
you
purchased
on
wednesday
do
you
ever
weigh
your
purchases
think
this
over
and
then
buy
a

of
scales
and

them

serve
steaks
the
selection
of
steak
depends
entirely
upon
the
number
of
persons
to
be
served
a
steak
can
not
be
classed
as
a
cheap
meat
the
portions
of
bone
and
trimming
makes
this
meat
a
rare
luxury
in
these
times
of
high
prices
yet
there
come
times
when
the
men
folk
want
steak
and
steak
it
must
be
there
are
three
kinds
of
meats
that
are
cut
into
steaks
namely
the
loin
rump
and
round
all
three
will
make
delicious
eating
if
properly
prepared
the
round
steak
has
the
least
waste
and
if
steaks
are
taken
from
the
first
three
cuts
they
should
be
tender
and
juicy
providing
they
are
cut
sufficiently
thick
and
are
properly
cooked
the
rump
steak
is
fully
as
tender
and
palatable
as
loin
and
it
contains
about
less
waste
the
sirloin
is
the
choicest
cut
in
the
whole
carcass
and
it
contains
a
proportionately
large
amount
of
waste
have
the
butcher
cut
the
round
steak
inch
thick
and
then
pound
it
with
a
meat
ax
to
break
the
tough
tissues
place
on
a
platter
and
brush
with
salad
oil
and
let
stand
for
hour
now
broil
in
the
usual
manner
turning
every
four
minutes
lift
to
a
hot
platter
and
spread
with
choice
meat
butters
given
below
rump
steak
should
be
cut
two
inches
thick
and
the
bone
and
fat
trimmed
now
nick
and
score
the
edge
of
the
fat
and
brush
with
salad
oil
and
then
broil
the
same
as
for
round
steak
the
sirloin
steak
should
be
cut
two
inches
thick
have
the
butcher
remove
the
chine
bone
and
then
the
flank
end
let
him
add
a
piece
of
suet
to
the
flank
end
then
put
it
through
the
food
chopper
for

it
is
a
mistake
to
cook
the
flank
with
the
sirloin
brush
the
steak
with

and
then
broil
lift
to
a
hot

place
one
pint
of
water
and
one
tablespoonful
of
salt
in
the
bottom
of
the

pan
to
prevent
the
fat
drippings
from
taking
fire
turn
the
meat
every
four
minutes
so
that
it
makes
the
cooking
even
to
test
the
meat
when
broiling
press
with
a
knife
if
it
is
soft
and
spongy
it
is
raw
watch
carefully
and
when
just
beginning
to
become
firm
it
is
rare
allow
four
minutes
for
medium
and
six
minutes
for
well
done
do
not
turn
the
meat
with
a
fork
the
intense
heat
has
sealed
or
seared
the
surface
and
caused
the
meat
to
retain
its
juices
and
if
you
use
a
fork
to
turn
it
you
will
puncture
or
make
an
opening
so
that
these
juices
will
escape

salads
salads
are
a
popular
summer
dish
they
should
be
made
from
fresh
vegetables
which
contain
the
elements
that
are
so
vitally
essential
for
our
physical
there
are
also
the
mineral
salts
which
help
purify
the
blood
stream
and
thus
keep
us
physically
fit
eggs
that
are
used
in
preparing
the
dressings
have
a
food
value
that
may
be
figured
upon
in
our
daily
ration
heavy
salads
composed
of
meat
are
best
to
be
eliminated
for
the
hot
weather
replace
them
with
light
dainty
attractive
salads
that
are
not
only
appetizing
but
also
easily
digested
the
making
of
a
successful
salad
is
an
art
indeed
the
proper
blending
of
the
various
ingredients
and
then
using
a
dressing
and
garnishing
so
that
it
will
not
only
satisfy
the
eye
but
will
tempt
the
palate
as
well
that
is
a
real
salad
the
proper
combinations
are
very
important
harmony
must
prevail
as
for
instance
a
combination
of
beets
tomatoes
and
carrots
would
not
only
be
inartistic
but
also
a
poor
combination
of
foods
care
must
be
taken
in
preparing
the
lettuce
or
other
greens
used
all
plants
that
form
into
heads
must
be
separately
and
thoroughly
washed
in
order
to
free
them
from
dirt
and
insects
and
then
they
should
be
given
a
final
washing
in
water
that
contains
one
tablespoon
of
salt
to
every
two
quarts
then
rinsed
in
ice
water
the
bath
in

water
will
remove
the
tiny
and
almost
invisible
mites
and
slugs
that
cling
to
these
greens

cut

tenth
round
an
inexpensive
cut
containing
only
per

waste
it
is
nutritious
as
tenderloin
but
not
as
tender
the
first
essential
in
cooking
is
to
sear
the
outside
in
order
to
retain
the
juices
and
then
cook
slowly
until
tender
steak
and
roast
are
cut
from
the
round
and
the
back
or
heel
and
is
used
for
pot
roast
and
stews
one
factor
in
helping
to
keep
up
the
high
prices
of
food
is
that
the
average
woman
she
goes
to
market
has
in
fancy
price
and
choice
cuts
for
roast
steaks
and
chops
the
choice
cuts
represent
about
per
cent
of
the
whole
carcass
leaving
about
per
cent
to
be
disposed
of
now
if
this
becomes
difficult
the
fancy
cuts
must
bear
the
additional
cost
and
so
become
proportionately
high
in
price

yearling
is
a

it
is
fully
as
nutritious
as
mutton
without
the
excess
fat
of
mutton
fat
mutton
frequently
disagrees
with
persons
of
delicate
digestion
and
therefore
should
be
discarded
from

should
be
substituted
the
choice

a
nice
change
for

is
to
give

corn
muffins

plain
rolls
or

in

of
bread
usually
in
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
getting
the
business
folk
off
in
time
in
the
morning
and
then
preparing
the
children
for
school
the
housewife
does
not
have
the
time
to
prepare
these
homey
breads
for
breakfast
the
price
of
butter
makes
it
almost
prohibitive
to
use
it
as
a
spread
for
hot
cakes
yet
we
all
like
the
butter
flavor
so
let
us
follow
the
example
of
the
thrifty
new
england
woman
who
puts
the
syrup
into
a
pitcher
and
then
adds
two
tablespoons
of
butter
to
one
and
cups
of
syrup
place
the
pitcher
into
a
pan
of
warm
water
and
then
heat
stir
frequently
so
that
the
butter
will
melt
and
blend
thoroughly
with
the
syrup
just
before
sending
to
the
table
beat
thoroughly
this
not
only
makes
a
delicious
spread
for
hot
cakes
and
waffles
and
the
like
but
it
is
a
real
economy

a
saving

this
mince
will
be
found
to
be
most
delicious
and
it
will
keep
until
used
grandma
perkins
grandad
was
a
hiram
teesdale
of
gloucester
england
and
this
recipe
is
over
years
old
the
original
recipe
was
named
christmas
mynce
pye
and
on
the
holidays
a
great
pye
of
gloucester
mynce
made
by
good
dame
teesdale
was
always
sent
as
a
tithe
from
the
county
to
the
good
queene
elizabeth
and
in
this
way
royal
favor
was
conferred
on
this
family
by
the
queen
who
was
delighted
with
the
wonderful
concoction
black
walnuts
and
hazel
nuts
were
used
in
the
original
recipe
but
as
these
nuts
are
quite
expensive
the
peanuts
will
do
just
as
well
christmas
goodies
in
the
days
of
long
ago
before
the
day
of
heated
apartments
and
homes
the
housewife
used
the
cellar
as
the
room
this
is
impossible
for
the
householder
who
has
an
outside
enclosed
laundry
or
summer
kitchen
the
problem
of
keeping
the
holiday
delicacies
is
quite
an
easy
one
but
to
those
of
us
who
dwell
in
flats
and
apartments
some
other
way
must
be
arranged
here
are
two
new
ideas
that
are
worth
trying
first
a
window
box
on
the
shady
side
of
the
house
this
box
must
be
lined
with
asbestos
paper
on
the
inside
and
then
covered
with
the
same
paper
and
an
additional
covering
of
oil
cloth
upon
the
outside
by
covering
the
box
in
this
way
the
housewife
is
assured
of
a
smaller
storage
space
of
an
even
temperature
neither
the
extreme
cold
nor
heat
will
affect
this
box
a
thick
layer
of
newspapers
may
be
used
as
a
lining
between
the
inside
covering
of
the
asbestos
and
the
oil
cloth
covering
upon
the
outside
of
the
box
mincemeat
must
be
stored
in
a
cool
dry
place
to
blend
and
ripen
without
the
danger
of
freezing
this
is
also
an
ideal
time
for
the
mother
to
plan
to
have
the
family
help
her
and
at
the
same
time
knit
the
home
ties
very
closely
together
the
home
where
the
family
joins
in
the
evening
to
make
the
seasonable
delicacies
is
a
very
happy
one
let
the
children
have
some
of
their
friends
in
to
help
them
with
the
preparations

thus
perfected
a

which
is
a
wooden
beater
with
a
number
of
wooden
rings
fastened
to
it
when
this
is
used

from
an
old
tea
merchant
in
london
i
received
my
instructions
for
making
a
perfect
cup
of
tea
first
rinse
out
the
teapot
with
cold
water
and
then
fill
it
with
boiling
water
and
let
stand
while
you
bring
the
water
intended
for
the
tea
to
a
boil
just
before
the
water
boils
turn
out
the
water
in
the

and
wipe
dry
then
add
the

freshly
boiled
water
cover
the

with
a

exactly
seven

give
you
a
delicious
drink
of
ambrosia
that
will
delight
the
heart
of
true
lovers
of
a
good
cup
of

the
use
of
a
cosy
for
the

is
to
hold
the
heat
in
the

and
thus
prevent
quick
cooling
use
one
level
teaspoon
of

diet
to
reduce
weight
correct
eating
is
essential
to
health
and
because
of
this
the
proper
cooking
and
serving
of
food
plays
an
important
part
in
either
the
building
up
or
reducing
of
weight
to
a
desired
average
as
a
rule
stout
people
seldom
realize
that
they
are
eating
food
that
is
entirely
unsuited
to
them
and
not
only
do
they
love
starchy
and
foods
but
also
they
frequently
consume
a
liberal
portion
of
sweets
now
unwise
eating
seldom
produces
its
effects
at
once
when
noticed
the
body
is
already
burdened
with
heavy
layers
of
fat
that
not
only
cause
their
bearer
to
be
distressed
and
uncomfortable
but
also
cause
disease
not
all
of
us
can
eat
every
food
that
is
put
before
us
but
we
can
so
arrange
our
menus
that
we
will
be
able
to
balance
the
diet
and
in
this
way
supply
the
body
with
just
its
required
needs
eating
portions
of
rich
desserts
fatty
foods
and
starchy
products
causes
these
foods
to
turn
into
a
fatty
tissue
and
then
be
stored
in
the
body
as
adipose
tissue
so
in
order
to
get
good
results
the
person
who
wishes
to
reduce
should
learn
to
thoroughly
chew
all
foods
by
this
i
mean
chew
the
food
very
fine
so
that
it
will
be
thoroughly
mixed
with
the
saliva
and
then
flow
without
much
effort
to
the
stomach
you
know
that
all
starchy
foods
are
changed
by
the
action
of
the
saliva
into
invert
sugars
they
then
go
to
the
stomach
where
they
are
thoroughly
diluted
with
gastric
juices
and
finally
passed
into
the
intestines
where
the
final
processes
of
digestion
take
place
this
form
of
starch
is
stored
by
the
liver
and
kidneys
and
thus
passes
out
to
the
various
tissues
to
be
held
in
the
body
as
fat
to
reduce
this
fleshy
tissue
it
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
storage
of
more
sugars
starches
and
fats
in
the
body
and
to
cause
that
which
is
already
stored
there
to
be
gradually
consumed
to
prevent
starving
many
people
who
go
on
a
diet
for
reducing
flesh
in
a
few
days
complain
of
great
weariness
exhaustion
and
gnawing
hunger
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
a
diet
that
cuts
down
the
supply
of
food
with
the
intention
of
reducing
is
extremely
dangerous
unless
it
is
supervised
by
a
physician
but
persons
who
wish
to
make
a
visible
reduction
of
flesh
in
a
time
ranging
from
five
to
six
weeks
can
do
so
if
they
will
learn
the
foods
that
cause
and
feed
these
tissues
and
learn
to
replace
this
with
foods
and
summer
time
is
an
ideal
time
to
accomplish
a
reduction
of
flesh

those
who

try
