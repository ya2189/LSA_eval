the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
was
held
in
the
city
of
louis
in
in
commemoration
of
the
acquisition
in
of
the
vast
territory
west
of
the
mississippi
then
called
louisiana
the
transfer
is
generally
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
important
events
in
our
national
history
and
stands
on
record
as
the
greatest
acquisition
of
territory
ever
made
by
peaceful
methods
an
american
historian
of
great
prominence
says
the
annexation
of
louisiana
was
an
event
so
portentous
as
to
defy
measurement
it
gave
a
new
face
to
politics
and
ranked
in
historical
importance
next
to
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
the
territory
was
ceded
to
france
by
spain
by
the
secret
treaty
of
san
ildefonso
in
this
aroused
to
intense
excitement
the
people
of
the
west
who
were
inclined
to
give
credit
to
the
rumor
that
the
army
of
forty
thousand
men
sent
by
napoleon
who
was
responsible
for
the
negotiation
of
that
treaty
were
in
reality
to
take
military
possession
of
louisiana
and
the
floridas
instead
of
to
suppress
the
insurrection
in
san
domingo
the
ostensible
object
france
and
england
had
been
struggling
for
many
years
for
supremacy
in
the
western
continent
and
in
the
possession
of
this
vast
territory
napoleon
foresaw
a
prosperous
new
france
but
there
were
many
complications
arising
at
home
important
political
questions
demanded
attention
and
the
great
napoleon
soon
realized
that
he
could
not
hope
to
cope
successfully
with
the
two
great
problems
lying
at
such
a
great
distance
apart
negotiations
for
transfer
of
territory
at
that
time
our
country
was
interested
in
procuring
possession
of
the
site
of
new
orleans
and
the
free
passage
of
the
mississippi
river
forever
for
all
american
citizens
and
negotiations
were
opened
for
their
purchase
by
thomas
jefferson
author
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
at
that
time
third
president
of
the
united
states
during
the
negotiations
napoleon
suggested
the
transfer
of
the
whole
louisiana
territory
and
the
transaction
was
brought
to
a
most
successful
conclusion
the
signers
of
the
treaty
being
james
monroe
robert
livingston
and
marbois
the
representative
of
napoleon
it
was
a
significant
bargain
by
it
napoleon
formed
closer
bonds
of
friendship
between
france
and
the
united
states
and
prevented
any
possibility
of
the
territory
falling
into
the
hands
of
great
britain
he
prophesied
that
this
republic
would
eventually
become
a
world
power
and
a
commercial
rival
to
england
how
completely
his
prophecy
was
fulfilled
our
country
attained
possession
of
a
vast
territory
embracing
more
than
a
million
square
miles
an
area
greater
than
the
combined
areas
of
the
british
isles
france
germany
spain
belgium
the
netherlands
and
italy
the
consideration
being
a
figure
less
than
that
representing
the
value
of
a
single
square
block
in
any
one
of
our
great
cities
or
an
amount
much
smaller
than
has
been
yielded
by
any
one
of
many
mines
within
the
boundaries
of
the
territory
twelve
flourishing
states
and
two
territories
have
since
been
carved
out
of
louisiana
and
the
center
of
our
population
is
rapidly
moving
towards
that
region
which
was
once
known
as
the
wilderness
of
the
west
robert
livingston
it
is
a
matter
of
the
utmost
gratification
that
the
state
of
new
york
played
so
important
a
part
in
this
great
event
in
the
person
of
robert
livingston
who
was
then
united
states
minister
to
france
livingston
the
title
of
having
been
conferred
upon
him
by
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
was
one
of
the
leading
statesmen
of
his
day
a
graduate
of
kings
now
columbia
college
he
began
his
career
in
the
practice
of
law
in
new
york
city
and
was
made
recorder
of
the
city
in
elected
to
the
continental
congress
in
he
was
appointed
one
of
a
committee
of
five
to
draft
the
declaration
of
independence
but
enforced
absence
from
philadelphia
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
sign
the
document
he
was
soon
after
elected
chancellor
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
as
such
administered
the
oath
of
office
to
george
washington
as
first
president
of
the
united
states
his
previous
training
in
public
affairs
admirably
fitted
him
for
assuming
the
important
duties
leading
to
the
transfer
of
the
louisiana
territory
and
to
him
as
much
as
to
any
individual
belongs
the
credit
for
the
successful
consummation
of
the
transaction
at
the
exposition
a
handsome
statue
of
livingston
by
lukemann
was
erected
in
the
cascade
gardens
on
the
approach
to
the
west
pavilion
upon
the
front
of
the
new
york
state
building
appeared
this
legend
robert
livingston
of
new
york
minister
to
france
inaugurated
the
negotiations
for
the
louisiana
purchase
and
was
the
first
to
sign
the
treaty
origin
of
the
exposition
the
first
action
looking
towards
the
commemoration
of
the
louisiana
purchase
was
taken
at
a
meeting
of
the
missouri
historical
society
in
september
when
a
committee
of
fifty
citizens
was
appointed
to
take
the
preliminary
steps
looking
to
the
observance
of
the
occasion
this
committee
recommended
the
submission
of
the
question
to
a
convention
of
delegates
representing
all
the
louisiana
purchase
states
and
at
this
convention
which
was
held
at
the
southern
hotel
louis
january
it
was
decided
to
hold
a
world
fair
as
the
most
fitting
commemoration
of
the
one
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
acquisition
of
the
louisiana
territory
an
executive
committee
with
the
hon
david
francis
as
chairman
was
appointed
to
carry
out
the
undertaking
and
this
committee
determined
that
at
least
the
amount
paid
to
france
for
the
territory
would
be
needed
action
by
congress
congress
passed
a
bill
in
june
carrying
a
provisional
appropriation
of
and
pledging
governmental
support
if
the
city
of
louis
raised
the
people
went
to
work
with
a
will
and
had
raised
by
popular
subscription
early
in
january
and
the
following
january
thirtieth
an
ordinance
was
passed
by
the
louis
municipal
assembly
authorizing
the
issuance
of
in
city
bonds
on
march
twelfth
president
mckinley
appointed
a
national
commission
of
nine
members
and
in
august
issued
a
proclamation
inviting
all
the
nations
of
the
world
to
participate
in
the
exposition
owing
to
labor
difficulties
and
delay
in
securing
construction
material
it
soon
became
evident
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
hold
the
fair
during
the
year
as
originally
planned
legislation
being
necessary
in
order
to
provide
for
the
necessary
postponement
a
bill
was
passed
by
congress
and
approved
by
president
roosevelt
june
authorizing
the
holding
of
the
fair
in
instead
of
as
originally
determined
beginning
with
the
basic
appropriation
of
footnote
in
the
winter
of
a
bill
was
passed
by
congress
authorizing
a
government
loan
of
to
the
exposition
company
to
be
repaid
in
instalments
from
the
gate
receipts
the
loan
was
entirely
canceled
early
in
november
as
described
above
to
which
had
been
added
appropriated
by
the
state
of
missouri
the
great
enterprise
was
projected
on
a
basis
it
was
planned
to
make
the
universal
exposition
at
louis
the
most
comprehensive
and
wonderful
that
the
world
had
ever
seen
how
well
its
projectors
succeeded
is
a
matter
of
recent
history
how
completely
all
previous
expositions
were
eclipsed
has
been
told
many
times
in
picture
and
in
print
the
site
the
site
chosen
for
the
exposition
included
the
western
portion
of
forest
park
one
of
the
finest
parks
in
the
united
states
its
naturally
rolling
ground
afforded
many
opportunities
for
effective
vistas
which
were
quickly
embraced
by
the
exposition
company
landscape
artists
containing
acres
it
was
a
tract
approximately
two
miles
long
and
one
mile
wide
the
grounds
might
be
said
to
have
been
divided
into
two
general
sections
the
dividing
line
being
skinker
road
to
the
east
was
the
main
picture
so
called
which
was
formed
by
the
grouping
of
eight
magnificent
exhibit
palaces
around
festival
hall
the
colonnade
of
states
and
cascade
gardens
the
main
picture
festival
hall
stood
upon
a
rise
of
ground
well
above
the
principal
exhibit
palaces
and
its
majestic
dome
surmounted
by
a
gilded
figure
of
victory
the
first
victory
to
take
the
form
of
a
man
was
visible
from
most
any
part
of
the
grounds
the
grouping
of
the
exhibit
palaces
was
geometric
in
arrangement
in
shape
like
an
open
fan
the
ribs
of
the
fan
being
the
waterways
and
plazas
between
which
the
exhibit
palaces
were
located
the
architecture
the
architecture
while
varied
and
in
some
instances
striking
was
still
so
modified
as
to
make
a
most
harmonious
whole
for
purity
in
architecture
the
best
example
was
the
palace
of
education
which
was
built
on
the
lines
of
the
italian
renaissance
for
most
striking
architectural
effects
the
mines
and
metallurgy
building
was
invariably
pointed
out
it
was
of
composite
architecture
comprising
features
of
the
egyptian
byzantine
and
greek
the
stately
obelisks
which
guarded
its
entrance
ways
and
the
panels
which
formed
its
outer
facade
were
objects
of
universal
interest
to
the
southeast
of
the
main
group
of
buildings
and
gracefully
clustered
among
the
trees
were
the
state
pavilions
along
the
extreme
northern
portion
of
the
grounds
for
a
mile
stretched
the
amusement
highway
known
as
the
pike
other
features
to
the
west
of
skinker
road
were
located
the
administration
buildings
and
with
one
or
two
exceptions
the
pavilions
of
foreign
governments
the
agriculture
and
horticulture
buildings
the
philippine
reservation
and
the
department
of
anthropology
the
intramural
railroad
seven
miles
in
length
passed
the
principal
points
of
interest
and
enabled
visitors
to
get
about
the
grounds
with
speed
and
comfort
to
convert
this
great
tract
of
land
into
a
beautiful
park
with
roadways
embellished
with
velvety
lawns
and
magnificent
flower
beds
would
seem
to
be
a
task
greater
than
man
could
perform
within
the
short
space
of
time
available
for
the
completion
of
the
exposition
that
it
was
done
and
well
done
is
a
matter
of
history
processes
as
well
as
products
it
was
early
determined
that
the
great
fair
should
be
one
of
processes
as
well
as
of
products
wherever
possible
there
should
be
life
and
motion
that
the
exhibits
should
answer
the
question
how
is
it
done
as
well
as
what
is
it
the
result
was
that
the
exposition
became
a
constantly
changing
scene
of
moving
objects
and
an
educational
force
many
times
greater
than
any
of
its
predecessors
the
student
of
mechanics
electricity
pedagogy
the
applied
arts
and
other
kindred
subjects
could
obtain
here
within
a
limited
area
valuable
data
which
otherwise
could
only
be
collected
at
the
expense
of
much
time
and
considerable
money
dedication
ceremonies
the
formal
dedication
ceremonies
covered
three
days
beginning
april
the
actual
date
of
the
centennial
anniversary
of
the
signing
of
the
treaty
and
one
year
previous
to
the
opening
of
the
exposition
our
commonwealth
was
fittingly
represented
at
that
time
a
special
appropriation
of
for
the
same
having
been
made
by
the
legislature
governor
odell
and
staff
state
officers
a
joint
committee
from
the
legislature
and
the
members
of
the
louisiana

attended
there
were
also
present
a
provisional
regiment
of
infantry
of
the
national

under
command
of

a
provisional
division
of
the
naval
militia
under
command
of

a
of
new
york
under
command
of
major
oliver
bridgman
the
first
day
program
the
program
for
the
first
day
consisted
of
a
grand
military
parade
in
the
morning
and
exercises
in
the
liberal
arts
building
at
two
in
the
afternoon
followed
by
fireworks
in
the
evening
the
day
was
cold
and
unpleasant
and
a
chill
wind
blowing
from
the
north
caused
visitors
to
seek
comfort
in
heavy
wraps
the
governor
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
her
troops
met
with
a
continuous
ovation
along
the
line
of
march
of
the
great
military
parade
and
from
every
side
compliments
and
felicitations
were
bestowed
upon
the
state
representatives
for
so
hearty
and
imposing
a
participation
in
an
event
a
thousand
miles
from
home
the
occasion
was
graced
by
the
presence
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
theodore
roosevelt
and
by
grover
cleveland
both
of
whom
made
extended
remarks
at
the
afternoon
exercises
address
of
president
roosevelt
the
address
of
president
roosevelt
was
replete
with
historical
allusions
and
pointed
epigrams
he
drew
many
lessons
from
the
valor
and
patriotism
of
the
early
settlers
of
the
west
and
said
among
other
things
courage
and
hardihood
are
indispensable
virtues
in
a
people
but
the
people
which
possesses
no
others
can
never
rise
high
in
the
scale
either
of
power
or
of
culture
great
peoples
must
have
in
addition
the
governmental
capacity
which
comes
only
when
individuals
fully
recognize
their
duties
to
one
another
and
to
the
whole
body
politic
and
are
able
to
join
together
in
feats
of
constructive
statesmanship
and
of
honest
and
effective
administration
we
justly
pride
ourselves
on
our
marvelous
material
prosperity
and
such
prosperity
must
exist
in
order
to
establish
a
foundation
upon
which
a
higher
life
can
be
built
but
unless
we
do
in
very
fact
build
this
higher
life
thereon
the
material
prosperity
itself
will
go
for
but
very
little
the
old
days
were
great
because
the
men
who
lived
in
them
had
mighty
qualities
and
we
must
make
the
new
days
great
by
showing
these
same
qualities
we
must
insist
upon
courage
and
resolution
upon
hardihood
tenacity
and
fertility
of
resource
we
must
insist
upon
the
strong
virile
virtues
and
we
must
insist
no
less
upon
the
virtues
of
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
we
must
show
our
abhorrence
of
cruelty
brutality
and
corruption
in
public
and
in
private
life
alike
address
of
cleveland
ex
president
cleveland
delivered
an
eloquent
panegyric
and
in
closing
said
we
may
well
recall
in
these
surroundings
the
wonderful
measure
of
prophecy
fulfillment
within
the
span
of
a
short
century
the
spirit
the
patriotism
and
the
civic
virtue
of
americans
who
lived
a
hundred
years
ago
and
god
overruling
of
the
wrath
of
man
and
his
devious
ways
for
the
blessing
of
our
nation
we
are
all
proud
of
our
american
citizenship
let
us
leave
this
place
with
this
feeling
stimulated
by
the
sentiments
born
of
the
occasion
let
us
appreciate
more
keenly
than
ever
how
vitally
necessary
it
is
to
our
country
wealth
that
every
one
within
its
citizenship
should
be
clean
minded
in
political
aim
and
aspiration
sincere
and
honest
in
his
conception
of
our
mission
and
aroused
to
higher
and
more
responsive
patriotism
by
the
reflection
that
it
is
a
solemn
thing
to
belong
to
a
people
favored
of
god
the
second
day
program
the
second
day
was
designated
diplomatic
day
and
was
devoted
to
a
luncheon
to
the
visiting
diplomats
in
the
administration
building
followed
by
exercises
in
festival
hall
at
which
time

were
made
by

who
was
president

honorable
david
francis
president
of
the
exposition
company
jean
jusserand
the
french
ambassador
and
senor
don
emilio
de
ojeda
the
spanish

in
the
evening
a
brilliant
reception
was
given
to
the
diplomatic
corps
at
the
louis
club
the
third
day
program
the
third
day
saturday
may
second
was
officially
designated
state
day
and
the
exercises
consisted
of
a
huge
civic
parade
which
consumed
two
hours
in
passing
a
given
point
and
exercises
at
two
in
the
liberal
arts
building
over
which
william
lindsay
of
the
national
commission
presided
addresses
were
made
by
governor

who
welcomed
the
governors
and
delegations
from
the
various
states
and
by
governor
odell
of
new
york
who
responded
his
brilliant
address
which
was
frequently
punctuated
by
applause
follows
address
of
governor
odell
dockery
ladies
and
gentlemen
there
is
no
phase
of
american
history
which
should
inspire
us
with
greater
pride
than
the
consummation
of
the
purchase
of
the
louisiana
tract
an
event
which
opened
the
pathway
to
the
west
and
made
possible
the
powerful
nation
to
which
we
owe
our
allegiance
trade
the
inspiration
for
travel
which
brought
about
the
discovery
and
civilization
of
the
western
hemisphere
would
have
demanded
inevitably
the
cession
to
the
united
states
of
the
vast
regions
beyond
the
mississippi
except
however
for
the
peaceful
and
diplomatic
measures
adopted
through
the
wisdom
of
thomas
jefferson
this
territory
could
only
have
been
acquired
by
the
sacrifice
of
human
life
and
the
expenditure
of
untold
treasure
that
robert
livingston
a
citizen
of
the
empire
state
became
the
ambassador
of
the
great
commoner
at
the
court
of
france
and
that
it
was
due
to
his
skill
and
intelligence
that
napoleon
was
brought
to
an
understanding
of
the
conditions
as
they
existed
and
of
the
determination
of
our
then
young
republic
to
prevent
the
building
up
of
foreign
colonies
at
our
very
threshold
is
a
cause
for
congratulation
to
the
people
of
the
state
i
represent
and
renders
the
duty
which
has
been
assigned
to
me
therefore
doubly
pleasant
memorable
as
was
this
event
and
of
great
importance
to
the
future
growth
of
the
republic
it
left
its
imprint
not
only
upon
america
but
upon
europe
as
well
through
it
the
napoleonic
ambition
to
develop
a
vast
plan
of
colonization
which
threatened
the
peace
of
the
world
was
thwarted
the
dismemberment
of
the
french
possessions
which
soon
followed
resulted
in
the
grouping
together
of
the
various
states
of
europe
into
vast
empires
whose
relations
with
our
country
are
such
that
encroachment
or
territorial
aggrandizement
upon
this
hemisphere
are
forever
impossible
spain
whose
waning
power
was
then
apparent
was
no
longer
a
menace
and
thus
rendered
possible
the
acquisition
of
the
remaining
stretch
of
territory
which
made
our
possessions
secure
from
the
gulf
to
the
canadian
line
while
therefore
as
americans
we
are
prone
to
the
belief
that
if
the
necessity
had
arisen
we
should
have
been
able
to
wrest
this
rich
and
fertile
territory
from
even
the
strongest
hands
it
is
well
for
us
to
understand
however
that
even
the
diplomacy
of
which
we
boast
would
have
been
futile
except
for
the
failure
of
napoleon
in
san
domingo
and
his
pressing
need
of
funds
to
permit
him
to
face
the
enemies
of
the
french
ho
was
the
cry
of
the
old
world
from
the
time
when
the
genius
of
columbus
accepted
the
theories
of
the
earlier
astronomers
the
imagination
and
cupidity
of
adventurous
spirits
had
been
excited
by
tales
of
off
cathay
one
hundred
years
ago
the
protocol
for
this
territory
was
signed
one
hundred
years
of
history
has
been
written
a
nation
of
three
millions
has
expanded
into
an
empire
of
eighty
millions
of
souls
our
country
has
not
only
become
a
power
among
the
nations
of
the
world
but
has
taken
an
advanced
position
in
the
progress
and
work
of
civilization
a
westward
passage
to
india
was
sought
by
columbus
and
was
still
the
aim
of
la
salle
in
his
adventurous
voyage
along
the
mighty
mississippi
the
american
flag
floats
at
the
very
gates
of
china
and
almost
in
sight
of
its
walls
placed
there
by
american
valor
and
by
american
arms
in
a
struggle
for
human
rights
and
liberty
trackless
forests
and
undulating
prairies
have
become
the
highways
for
the
speeding
engines
bearing
the
burdens
of
traffic
to
the
orient
no
longer
are
they
the
pasturage
for
the
buffalo
but
the
source
of
food
supply
for
the
whole
world
treasures
of
untold
value
have
been
laid
bare
by
the
ingenuity
of
man
but
far
beyond
this
wealth
are
the
products
in
grain
and
lowing
kine
which
add
their
hundreds
of
millions
to
the
resources
of
our
country
extending
even
beyond
the
dreams
or
the
imagination
of
those
who
sought
only
the
precious
metals
with
which
to
return
with
a
competence
to
their
native
land
this
is
but
the
span
of
a
century
and
to
commemorate
its
glories
we
come
from
the
eastern
section
from
the
earlier
colonies
to
congratulate
the
people
of
the
west
upon
the
results
which
we
as
a
nation
have
achieved
so
few
the
years
yet
how
notable
the
history
upon
this
soil
began
those
battles
which
ended
in
the
emancipation
of
the
slave
from
this
border
and
almost
from
within
this
territory
came
the
great
emancipator
a
man
who
struggled
with
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
in
early
life
who
aided
in
developing
the
great
west
and
whose
name
will
be
forever
enshrined
as
the
one
who
in
his
act
as
chief
magistrate
of
this
country
removed
the
stain
which
the
earlier
dutch
had
fastened
upon
our
body
politic
like
a
sore
the
past
with
all
of
its
achievements
with
all
of
its
successes
is
to
us
but
an
incentive
and
guide
for
the
future
progress
of
our
country
america
still
beckons
to
the
oppressed
of
all
lands
and
holds
out
the
gifts
of
freedom
and
we
at
this
time
and
upon
this
occasion
should
renew
our
adherence
to
those
policies
which
have
made
us
great
as
a
nation
the
future
is
before
us
and
the
patriotism
and
of
those
who
made
the
history
so
glorious
should
be
an
inspiration
to
us
all
for
higher
ideals
of
citizenship
through
the
golden
gates
of
commerce
pours
an
unceasing
stream
of
immigration
which
must
be
amalgamated
with
american
ideas
and
american
principles
from
the
earlier
settlers
has
come
a
blending
of
the
vigor
of
the
with
the
teutonic
and
latin
races
resulting
in
that
composite
type
which
we
are
wont
to
recognize
and
regard
as
the
type
of
the
true
american
aside
from
the
commercial
and
industrial
results
which
followed
the
acquisition
of
this
vast
and
fertile
territory
and
the
building
up
of
the
large
marts
and
towns
which
everywhere
blend
with
its
magnificent
scenery
the
definition
of
the
power
and
extent
of
our
constitution
was
most
important
at
its
inception
coming
at
a
time
when
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
not
only
able
to
interpret
their
work
but
to
give
to
it
their
moral
force
and
support
it
was
demonstrated
that
no
constitutional
limitations
should
retard
the
onward
growth
the
onward
rush
of
american
civilization
until
it
should
have
reached
the
farthermost
bounds
of
the
pacific
the
barriers
to
human
progress
were
by
this
interpretation
removed
and
ranges
of
new
states
have
given
effect
to
the
democratic
principles
of
our
great
republic
and
have
made
of
our
country
a
union
not
of
weak
impotent
states
but
a
commonwealth
of
nations
bound
to
each
other
through
a
centralized
government
by
ties
of
allegiance
common
interest
and
patriotism
where
freemen
rule
and
where
suffrage
is
more
esteemed
than
wealth
these
rights
and
their
protection
should
receive
our
earnest
thought
the
battles
of
the
past
have
been
for
freedom
and
liberty
and
the
struggles
of
the
future
will
be
for
their
preservation
not
however
by
force
of
arms
but
through
the
peaceful
methods
which
come
through
the
education
of
our
people
the
declaration
which
brought
our
republic
into
existence
has
insured
and
guaranteed
that
liberty
of
conscience
and
that
freedom
of
action
which
does
not
interfere
with
the
prerogatives
or
privileges
of
a
man
neighbors
capital
and
labor
are
the
two
great
elements
upon
which
the
prosperity
and
happiness
of
our
people
rest
and
when
therefore
aggregations
of
the
one
are
met
by
combinations
of
the
other
it
should
be
the
aim
of
all
to
prevent
the
clashing
of
these
great
interests
the
products
of
toil
are
worthless
unless
there
be
some
means
by
which
they
can
be
substituted
or
transferred
for
that
which
labor
requires
the
concrete
form
in
which
these
transactions
are
conducted
is
the
money
power
or
the
capital
of
the
land
without
work
all
of
these
fertile
fields
these
teeming
towns
would
have
been
impossible
and
without
a
desire
to
benefit
and
elevate
humanity
its
onward
progress
would
have
been
useless
to
work
to
labor
is
bounden
duty
and
in
the
performance
of
the
tasks
which
have
been
placed
upon
him
he
should
be
encouraged
and
his
greatest
incentive
should
be
the
knowledge
that
he
may
transmit
to
his
children
and
his
children
a
higher
civilization
and
greater
advantages
than
he
himself
possessed
trade
conditions
which
would
permit
to
the
toiler
but
a
bare
sustenance
the
bare
means
of
a
livelihood
would
be
a
hindrance
to
human
progress
a
hindrance
not
to
be
removed
by
all
of
the
maxims
of
the
philosopher
or
the
theories
of
the
doctrinaire
promise
without
fulfillment
is
barren
but
when
you
can
place
before
the
mechanic
the
assured
fact
that
the
performance
of
his
duty
means
success
in
life
and
that
his
means
failure
when
you
can
show
him
that
this
law
is
immutable
you
have
made
of
him
a
useful
citizen
and
have
instilled
into
his
mind
a
firm
belief
that
the
freedom
and
liberty
of
which
we
boast
is
not
an
inchoate
substance
to
be
dreamed
of
and
not
enjoyed
but
this
desired
result
can
not
be
secured
if
combinations
of
capital
which
produce
the
necessaries
of
life
cheaper
and
better
are
assailed
as
the
enemies
of
mankind
there
is
always
a
mean
between
those
who
seek
only
a
fair
recompense
and
return
for
that
which
they
produce
and
those
who
seek
undue
advantages
for
the
few
at
the
expense
of
the
many
the
laws
which
have
been
enacted
if
properly
executed
are
sufficient
in
their
force
and
effect
to
encourage
the
one
and
to
punish
the
other
but
in
our
condemnation
let
us
not
forget
that
with
the
expansion
that
has
come
to
our
country
an
expansion
of
our
business
relations
is
also
necessary
this
growth
has
brought
us
into
intimate
contact
with
the
markets
of
the
world
and
in
the
struggle
that
is
always
before
us
the
competition
of
trade
if
we
are
to
hold
our
own
among
the
world
producers
we
should
encourage
and
not
hinder
those
who
by
their
energy
their
capital
and
their
labor
have
banded
together
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
these
new
conditions
problems
which
our
individual
efforts
alone
can
not
solve
but
which
require
the
concentrated
force
and
genius
of
both
capital
and
labor
incentive
for
good
citizenship
would
indeed
be
lacking
if
there
were
taken
from
us
the
opportunities
for
development
the
opportunities
for
the
young
man
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
those
who
have
written
their
names
in
the
history
of
our
country
as
the
great
captains
of
industry
success
will
always
follow
perseverance
and
genius
every
heresy
every
doctrine
which
would
teach
the
young
man
of
this
country
differently
is
an
insult
to
the
intelligence
of
our
people
and
is
in
the
direction
of
building
up
a
dangerous
element
in
american
society
which
in
time
would
threaten
not
only
the
peace
and
prosperity
we
enjoy
but
our
very
institutions
themselves
when
you
have
placed
before
the
young
man
all
of
his
possibilities
you
have
made
it
impossible
to
make
of
our
republic
a
plutocracy
controlled
by
the
few
at
the
expense
of
the
many
the
individual
should
count
for
as
much
as
the
aggregation
of
individuals
because
an
injury
to
the
one
will
lead
to
the
destruction
of
the
many
the
question
of
adjusting
and
harmonizing
the
relations
of
capital
and
labor
is
the
problem
before
us
and
is
one
which
will
become
more
urgent
in
the
future
its
solution
must
be
along
those
lines
of
constitutional
right
which
every
citizen
has
been
guaranteed
every
man
is
entitled
in
the
prosecution
of
his
work
to
the
broadest
possible
liberty
of
action
and
the
protection
of
law
of
that
law
which
is
the
outgrowth
of
necessity
and
which
seeks
to
encourage
and
not
to
oppress
such
recognition
can
always
be
secured
if
there
is
a
determination
upon
the
part
of
those
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
government
to
have
it
and
who
is
not
every
man
possessed
of
a
ballot
is
responsible
and
has
the
power
not
only
to
formulate
but
to
criticise
and
to
punish
as
well
if
this
right
be
properly
exercised
an
honest
and
efficient
administration
of
our
affairs
can
always
be
secured
to
aid
in
this
work
we
have
given
to
the
press
the
broadest
possible
liberty
a
freedom
which
however
should
never
be
abused
it
should
never
be
used
as
the
medium
for
the
circulation
of
charges
or
of
calumnies
which
are
without
foundation
and
which
please
but
the
fancies
of
those
in
whose
minds
there
always
exists
envy
and
discontent
such
a
misuse
of
privileges
should
be
condemned
by
all
citizens
in
its
virtuous
indignation
with
those
who
abuse
public
place
and
power
it
should
be
careful
to
do
exact
justice
because
in
our
busy
and
active
lives
we
have
come
to
depend
to
a
very
great
extent
upon
the
wisdom
and
the
honesty
of
these
who
edit
our
newspapers
for
the
information
rightly
to
judge
of
the
conditions
events
and
necessities
of
our
country
by
means
of
the
press
and
with
an
intelligent
citizenship
we
may
always
feel
sure
that
there
will
come
into
our
public
life
influences
for
good
which
will
render
our
government
more
stable
will
add
to
its
renown
and
to
its
glory
and
will
insure
for
all
the
perpetuation
of
those
principles
which
have
come
down
to
us
through
the
wisdom
of
our
forefathers
and
which
have
been
amplified
by
the
knowledge
of
succeeding
generations
the
greatest
solvent
for
political
heresies
for
doctrines
which
are
antagonistic
to
popular
government
is
education
to
the
educated
mind
there
comes
a
conception
of
duty
which
is
not
possible
to
the
ignorant
the
great
colleges
and
schools
with
which
we
are
blessed
are
performing
a
vital
work
and
these
institutions
for
developing
a
higher
order
of
citizenship
are
of
far
more
worth
and
of
greater
importance
than
all
of
the
ships
of
war
or
the
arms
of
the
nation
in
maintaining
and
upholding
those
policies
which
have
been
adopted
for
our
protection
against
foreign
and
domestic
foes
but
it
is
not
alone
a
theoretical
education
which
is
necessary
for
this
higher
citizenship
it
must
be
linked
with
the
knowledge
which
comes
of
the
study
of
the
character
of
the
manner
and
methods
of
other
nations
than
our
own
which
leads
the
artisan
to
inspect
and
to
improve
upon
the
ingenuity
of
his
fellows
of
other
lands
it
is
this
feature
in
the
exposition
which
is
to
take
place
upon
this
ground
next
year
that
is
particularly
significant
and
important
in
the
solution
of
the
problems
to
which
i
have
referred
it
is
the
contact
the
friendly
rivalry
thus
created
which
brings
about
a
betterment
and
improvement
of
conditions
it
is
appropriate
therefore
that
at
the
one
hundredth
anniversary
of
this
great
event
of
our
nation
history
we
should
gather
here
all
of
the
ingenuity
and
the
genius
of
the
past
and
the
present
that
we
may
contrast
and
make
note
of
our
progress
this
will
be
an
inspiration
for
us
in
the
performance
of
our
duty
and
will
add
to
our
affection
for
our
native
and
adopted
land
and
thus
make
of
america
a
still
greater
power
for
good
a
patriotic
people
is
possible
only
when
there
exists
a
love
of
country
which
has
been
inspired
by
the
stories
of
the
past
it
is
the
stories
of
the
glorious
past
which
encourage
us
to
grapple
with
the
problems
of
the
present
and
to
look
with
disdain
upon
those
who
fail
to
solve
them
what
fills
our
mind
with
more
gratitude
what
inspires
us
with
greater
heroism
what
instills
more
patriotism
than
the
struggles
of
the
early
colonial
wars
the
energy
which
swept
from
this
continent
the
dominion
of
those
who
sought
only
wealth
and
which
substituted
the
thrift
of
the
voyagers
of
the
and
of
the
settlers
of
jamestown
which
speaks
of
the
battles
with
the
indians
which
tells
of
the
glories
not
only
of
victories
but
of
the
defeats
of
the
heroes
of
the
revolution
all
are
incentives
for
purer
and
better
citizenship
and
so
too
as
we
recall
the
struggles
to
the
death
of
the
descendants
of
these
earlier
settlers
in
the
greatest
civil
war
that
the
world
has
ever
known
let
us
both
in
charity
and
in
patriotism
remember
them
all
as
heroes
while
we
may
differ
as
to
the
principles
for
which
they
fought
there
is
no
conflict
of
opinion
no
divergence
in
thought
which
bids
us
to
withhold
our
admiration
for
all
those
who
took
part
in
that
great
struggle
it
was
but
a
page
in
our
nation
history
but
a
page
shaded
by
human
blood
it
was
but
the
working
out
the
will
of
divine
providence
so
that
from
its
baptism
of
blood
our
republic
might
emerge
greater
stronger
and
more
powerful
than
ever
before
that
there
might
thereafter
be
no
sectional
hate
no
dividing
line
in
the
patriotism
of
our
people
this
it
is
which
should
inspire
us
more
progress
a
further
advance
in
civilization
the
extending
of
a
helping
hand
to
the
afflicted
and
the
welcoming
word
to
the
oppressed
should
be
concrete
evidence
of
america
greatness
and
of
the
devotion
of
her
people
then
it
will
be
that
our
flag
now
honored
and
respected
honored
because
of
the
power
and
the
intelligence
of
our
people
will
take
on
additional
lustre
and
additional
significance
as
that
of
a
nation
that
has
accepted
its
duty
to
protect
humanity
at
home
and
abroad
and
to
stand
as
the
pacificator
and
preserver
of
the
peace
of
the
world

said
our
exhibitors
could
have
no
higher
testimonial
than
that
furnished
by
the
magnificent
buildings
and
grounds
of
this
exposition
we
have
here
combined
in
brilliant
variety
the
charms
and
beauties
of
garden
forest
lake
and
stream
embellished
by
these
splendid
structures
forming
an
harmonious
whole
certainly
not
equaled
by
any
former
exposition
all
credit
is
due
the
president
and
directors
whose
intelligence
and
untiring
labors
have
conquered
all
obstacles
and
brought
this
world
fair
to
a
most
auspicious
and
successful
opening
one
can
not
view
the
result
of
their
labors
without
being
deeply
impressed
with
the
magnitude
of
their
undertaking
and
when
we
consider
the
exhibits
which
have
been
assembled
within
these
grounds
we
are
led
irresistibly
to
an
appreciation
of
the
multitude
of
forces
which
contributed
to
this
great
work
and
particularly
to
the
which
must
have
existed
to
produce
the
result
before
us
i
have
the
honor
on
this
occasion
to
speak
for
our
exhibitors
they
are
well
represented
by
their
works
before
you
and
by
these
works
you
can
know
them
these
exhibits
represent
in
concrete
form
the
artistic
and
industrial
development
of
this
country
and
in
viewing
them
one
can
not
but
be
impressed
with
the
great
improvement
in
the
conditions
affecting
our
material
and
physical
welfare
and
with
the
corresponding
advancement
in
our
intellectual
and
esthetic
life
let
us
consider
for
a
moment
the
processes
by
which
this
result
has
been
reached
we
have
here
collected
the
products
of
our
artistic
scientific
and
industrial
life
the
raw
materials
of
the
farm
the
vineyard
the
mine
and
the
forest
have
been
transformed
by
the
skilled
artisan
the
artist
and
the
architect
into
the
finished
products
before
you
by
the
of
all
these
resources
of
all
these
activities
of
all
these
workers
this
result
has
been
accomplished
from
the
felling
of
the
trees
in
the
forest
the
tilling
of
the
soil
and
the
mining
of
the
ore
through
all
the
steps
and
processes
required
to
produce
from
the
raw
material
the
complicated
machine
or
the
costly
fabric
there
must
have
been
and
all
incongruous
elements
and
resistant
forces
must
have
been
eliminated
or
overcome
the
chief
factor
therefore
which
has
contributed
to
these
results
is
the
of
all
our
people
the
first
law
of
our
civilization
is
the
of
all
individuals
to
improve
the
conditions
of
life
by
division
of
labor
each
individual
is
assigned
to
or
takes
his
special
part
in
our
social
organization
this
specialization
of
labor
has
become
most
minute
not
only
is
this
true
in
scientific
and
philosophic
research
in
professional
and
business
life
but
in
the
simplest
and
earliest
occupations
of
men
such
as
the
tilling
of
the
soil
the
specialist
is
found
bringing
to
the
aid
of
his
industry
expert
and
scientific
knowledge
in
the
division
of
labor
and
the
resultant
specialization
of
human
activity
we
have
necessarily
different
classes
of
workers
some
of
whom
have
adopted
the
idea
by
forming
organizations
by
which
they
seek
to
better
their
conditions
no
doubt
each
class
of
workers
has
its
particular
interests
which
may
be
legitimately
improved
by
among
its
members
and
thus
far
the
labor
organization
has
a
lawful
purpose
but
while
standing
for
its
rights
it
can
not
legitimately
deny
to
any
other
class
its
rights
nor
should
it
go
to
the
extent
of
infringing
the
personal
and
inalienable
rights
of
its
members
as
individuals
on
the
contrary
it
must
accord
to
its
own
members
and
to
others
the
same
measure
of
justice
that
it
demands
for
itself
as
an
organization
in
working
out
this
problem
there
has
been
much
conflict
indeed
according
to
human
experience
such
conflict
could
not
entirely
be
avoided
but
in
the
end
each
class
must
recognize
that
it
can
not
exist
independently
of
others
it
can
not
strike
down
or
defeat
the
rights
or
interests
of
others
without
injuring
itself
should
capital
demand
more
than
its
due
by
that
demand
it
limits
its
opportunities
and
correspondingly
the
laborer
who
demands
more
than
his
due
thereby
takes
away
from
himself
the
opportunity
to
labor
no
one
can
escape
this
law
of
demands
that
we
must
observe
its
just
limitations
we
must
be
ready
to
do
our
part
and
accord
to
all
others
the
fair
opportunity
of
doing
their
part
we
must
with
and
help
our
colaborer
we
should
approach
the
solution
of
each
question
which
may
arise
with
a
reasonable
and
better
still
a
friendly
spirit
he
who
obstructs
the
reasonable
adjustment
of
these
questions
who
fosters
strife
by
appealing
to
class
prejudice
may
justly
be
regarded
by
all
as
an
enemy
to
the
best
public
interests
in
conclusion
permit
me
to
advert
to
the
louisiana
purchase
which
we
are
now
celebrating
and
call
attention
to
the
importance
of
that
event
in
securing
to
our
people
the
fullest
benefit
of
the
idea
manifestly
if
our
government
were
restricted
to
the
original
territory
of
the
united
states
as
defined
by
the
treaty
of
we
must
have
encountered
in
many
ways
the
opposition
of
governments
some
of
them
european
which
would
have
occupied
the
territory
beyond
our
original
south
and
west
boundaries
our
trade
and
commerce
moving
from
or
to
our
original
territory
would
necessarily
have
been
largely
restricted
by
hostile
foreign
powers
the
louisiana
purchase
not
only
more
than
doubled
our
territory
by
adding
a
country
rich
in
material
resources
but
gave
us
control
of
the
mississippi
river
and
made
possible
the
acquisition
of
the
oregon
territory
the
mexican
cessions
and
the
annexation
of
texas
though
much
has
been
done
towards
the
development
of
this
imperial
domain
yet
we
may
truly
say
that
we
have
only
seen
the
beginning
of
that
development
the
possibilities
for
the
future
are
boundless
with
a
land
of
unparalleled
resources
occupied
by
a
people
combining
the
best
elements
of
our
modern
civilization
and
governed
by
laws
evolved
from
the
highest
and
best
progress
of
the
human
race
no
eye
can
foresee
the
goal
to
which
a
of
all
these
forces
must
lead
the
mexican
commissioner
nuncio
spoke
in
behalf
of
the
foreign
exhibitors
the
concluding
address
was
made
by
hon
william
taft
secretary
of
war
who
attended
as
the
special
representative
of
the
president
at
its
conclusion
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
the
white
house
at
washington
pressed
a
key
that
started
the
machinery
unfurled
the
flags
set
the
cascades
in
motion
and
thus
opened
the
exposition
beneficent
results
to
the
question
was
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
a
success
the
answer
must
be
an
unqualified
affirmative
the
value
of
any
great
exposition
can
not
be
measured
in
dollars
and
cents
any
more
than
it
can
be
measured
in
pounds
and
ounces
the
great
fair
at
louis
was
not
projected
as
a
undertaking
it
was
held
to
commemorate
a
great
event
in
american
history
and
was
designed
to
arouse
a
popular
interest
in
the
story
of
the
acquisition
of
the
louisiana
territory
and
its
glorious
results
to
more
closely
knit
together
the
peoples
of
the
earth
in
good
fellowship
and
brotherly
love
to
give
to
all
nations
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
to
each
other
their
progress
in
material
things
to
awaken
in
the
american
people
a
sense
of
civic
pride
and
a
determined
resolution
to
maintain
and
advance
the
prestige
which
they
now
enjoy
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
having
fulfilled
all
this
who
shall
say
that
the
exposition
has
been
a
failure
fair

from
new

the
state

every
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
connection
with
the
great
fair
not

in
her
official
participation
which
through
the
generous
action
and
hearty
support
of

executive
and
the

was
on
a
most
liberal
and
comprehensive
scale

standing
just
to

of
the
plaza
louis
was
the
work
of
carrere
and
hastings
also
new
yorkers
it
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
successful
structures
upon
the
grounds
from
an
architect
point
of
view
and
it
was
appropriate
that
to
new
york
men
should
have
been
intrusted
the
construction
of
the
building
in
which
exhibits
of
manufactures
were
displayed
in
view
of
the
of
our
state
from
a
manufacturing
and
commercial
standpoint
and
so
throughout
all
the
departments
of
the
great
fair
and
throughout
the
season
one
constantly
encountered
those
who
by
some
tie
were
bound
to
new
york
many
of
her
sons
who
had
gone
forth
in
their
youth
came
back
and
called
at
the
new
york
state
building
and
recalled
some
pleasant
incident
of
the
old
days
or
made
grateful
acknowledgment
of
some
benefit
which
had
come
to
them
from
their
native
state
one
of
the
most
delightful
features
of
all
the
experiences
of
those
who
had
the
honor
officially
to
represent
the
empire
state
at
louis
was
the
meeting
of
the
sons
and
daughters
who
had
long
since
left
home
conclusion
the
gates
had
scarcely
closed
for
the
last
time
when
the
work
of
destruction
and
demolition
began
all
of
the
beauties
of
the
dream
city
which
for
seven
months
had
been
the
admiration
of
thousands
and
an
inspiration
to
all
to
do
higher
and
better
things
were
swept
away
almost
in
a
night
and
soon
the
whole
scene
will
be
restored
to
a
park
to
those
who
had
come
to
love
its
majestic
structures
its
placid
waterways
its
attractive
vistas
and
its
fairy
like
illumination
comes
a
pang
of
regret
tempered
with
the
feeling
of
gratefulness
that
it
ever
existed
and
that
it
was
their
privilege
to
witness
it
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
it
shall
always
be
theirs
to
remember
and
to
dream
of
most
effectually
was
the
whole
story
told
in
an
address
on
chicago
day
by
ernest
mcgaphey
a
poet
from
that
city
in
its
truest
sense
this
exposition
is
epic
and
dramatic
the
mere
prose
of
it
will
come
to
lie
neglected
on
the
dusty
shelves
of
statisticians
but
its
poetry
will
be
a
priceless
legacy
to
generations
that
will
follow
and
thus
there
is
one
light
only
which
may
not
fade
from
the
windows
of
time
one
glint
to
illuminate
the
flight
of
the
dying
years
that
gleam
which
lives
in
fancy
and
in
memory
and
when
this
vision
of
magic
departs
when
the
ivory
towers
have
vanished
and
the
sound
of
flowing
waters
has
been
stilled
there
will
exist
with
us
yet
the
recollection
of
it
all
and
so
at
the
end
the
most
enduring
fabric
known
to
man
is
woven
of
the
warp
and
woof
of
dreams
the
canvas
of
the
great
painters
will
crumble
the
curves
of
noble
statuary
be
ground
into
dust
by
time
and
all
this
pageantry
of
art
and
commerce
disappear
but
memory
will
keep
a
record
of
these
days
as
a
woman
will
treasure
old
love
letters
and
in
the
last
analysis
the
height
and
breadth
the
depth
and
scope
of
this
splendid
achievement
shall
be
measured
by
a
dream

all
bear
testimony
to

acknowledged
prominence

two
hundred

hundredths

that

served
the

absolutely
without

only
necessary

faithfulness

one
in
which
it
may
take
a
pardonable
pride

virtue
of

first
named
by
the

these
preliminary
formalities
over
the
commission
began
in
earnest
the
work
of
preparation
for
the
state
participation
at
louis
believing
that
the
most
conspicuous
feature
of
the
state
participation
in
the
exposition
especially
so
far
as
the
impression
which
would
be
made
upon
visitors
was
concerned
would
be
her
state
building
the
commission
gave
its
first
attention
to
this
feature
having
been
assigned
such
a
commanding
site
the
commission
kept
in
mind
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
erect
upon
it
a
building
of
appropriate
dignity
and
dimensions
it
soon
became
evident
that
with
the
appropriation
already
made
it
would
be
impossible
to
erect
a
suitable
building
maintain
it
and
make
suitable
exhibits
in
the
great
departments
of
the
fair
in
which
the
state
of
new
york
stands
steps
were
therefore
taken
to
procure
an
additional
appropriation
from
the
legislature
of
the
matter
being
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
executive
committee

thirtieth
a

called
for
the
purpose
of
considering

was
commemorated
by

spent
large
sums

in

in

the

resolution
was

at

in

that
the

desire
to

to

exposition
company
and
the

departments
with
whom
they
have
been
brought
in
personal
contact
their
appreciation
of
the
delightful
courtesy
extended
them
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
exposition
authorities
to
facilitate
the
departmental
work
of
new
york
in
connection
with
the
exposition
we
can
not
fail
to
express
our
admiration
of
the
gigantic
task
which
the
officers
of
this
great
international
fair
have
carried
to
such
a
successful
culmination
in
the
entire
history
of
expositions
there
has
been
evidenced
no
greater
progress
and
such
work
could
not
have
been
accomplished
save
through
the
most
prodigious
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
projectors
of
this
vast
enterprise
when
louis
opens
her
exposition
gates
next

it
will
be

it
further
that

this
resolution
to

francis

new
york
day
the
commission
took
considerable
care
in
the
choosing
of
a
day
to
be
known
as
new
york
day
it
was
considered
important
that
a
date
should
be
named
upon
which
it
would
be
possible
for
the
governor
to
be
present
moreover
it
seemed
essential
that
no
date
during
the
heat
of
the
summer
should
be
designated
as
but
few
new
yorkers
would
be
apt
to
be
present
at
louis
at
that
time
and
therefore
after
mature
consideration
october
fourth
was
designated
as
new
york
state
day
the
legislature
of
passed
an
additional
appropriation
of
by
chapter
which
is
given
below

unparalleled
in

descendants
of
this
vast
tract
of
country
the
cession
of

more
than
doubled
the
area
of
our
country
a
century
ago

great
states
have
been
carved
out

territory

is
reaching
out
as
a
world
power
that
we
should
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
the
first
great
chapter
in
the
history
of
our
national
expansion
time
has
proven
that
jefferson
and
his
compeers
built
greater
than
they
knew
for
by
that
acquisition
of
territory
there
was
developed
a
spirit
of
national
progress
that
did
not
cease
even
when
we
first
learned
to
know
no
superior
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
representatives
of
half
a
dozen
different
nations
met
in
the
smoking
room
of
an
ocean
liner
sometime
ago
it
was
suggested
that
each
nation
be
toasted
an
englishman
paid
a
glowing
tribute
to
his
country
a
frenchman
lauded
his
nation
and
a
russian
eulogized
the
land
of
the
czar
then
an
american
arose

but
that

possessed
the
american
spirit
which
recognizes
no
limit
to
the
possibilities
of
our
future
i
recognize
that
this
is
no
occasion
for

boasting
each
state

and
american
possession
is
unselfishly
interested
in
the
success
of
this
exposition
however
in
connection
with
what
new
york
is
expected
to
do
for
this
grand
enterprise
you
will
pardon
i
know
this
very
brief
reference
i
make
to
new
york
supremacy
in
population
in
wealth
in
manufactures
and
in
commerce
i
think
it
less
than
twenty
years
ago
that
new
york
was
ahead
in
agricultural
productions
too
agricultural
supremacy
has
been
tending
westward
for
nearly
a
half
century
however
and
we
cheerfully
surrender
to
your
broad
prairies
iowa
ohio
and
illinois
now
outrank
us
in
farm
industry

first
once

of
the
louisiana
tract
and
the
other
two
cut
from
the
northwest
territory
an
eastern
farmer
on
his
first
visit
to
the
west
asked
his
western
brother
how
it
was
that
could
plow
such
straight
furrows
over
such
enormous
fields
easy
said
the
native
follow
the
parallels
of
latitude
and
the
meridians
of
longitude
that
reply
was
significant
it
demonstrates
quite
fully
where
agriculture
is
king
in
the
united
states
the
end
of
the
great
strides
that
you
are
making
here
in
the
west
is
not
in
sight
some
day
your
population
will
be
as
dense
as
ours
slowly
but
steadily
the
center
of
population
is
creeping
westward
and
by
another
decade
or
so
it
will
most
likely
cross
the
great
father
of
waters
and
move
across
the
land
which
jefferson
genius
gave
to
the
republic
new
york
will
be
more
powerful
by
reason
of
your
greatness
your
increasing
productions
will
contribute
to
our
commercial
prestige
more
and
more
as
the
years
roll
on
to
make
our
metropolis
continue
to
be
the
greatest
seaport
on
this
continent
for
all
time
we
share
your
glory
in
more
ways
than
this
too
many
of
the
sturdy
men
and
women
who
have
settled
within
the
confines
of
this
great
region
were
native
new
yorkers
our
blood
has
been
mingled
with
yours
and
our
children
are
first
cousins
of
yours
new
york
gave
to
you
because
she
could
spare
and
you
accepted
of
us
because
you
wanted
the
best
you
could
find
new
york
then
bids
the
people
of
this
section
all
hail
we
are
with
you
heart
and
soul
to
make
the
exposition
a
magnificent
success
new
york
has
never
failed
when
a
patriotic
effort
was
demanded
and
as
ever
before
she
will
now
respond
with
enthusiasm
and
will
do
everything
possible
here
to
sustain
her
imperial
position
let
us
hope
that
the
exposition
will
accomplish
all
that
is
intended
let
our
prayer
be
that
all
americans
who
pass
within
the
gates
when
all
shall
be
made
ready
for
the
opening
of
this
exposition
in
will
cherish
a
higher
ambition
and
a
greater
love
of
country
and
be
impelled
to
declare
with
the
poet
that
is
a
land
of
every
land
the
pride
beloved
of
heaven
all
the
world
beside
where
brighter
suns
dispense
serener
light
and
milder
moons
imparadise
the
night
oh
thou
shalt
find
thy
footsteps
roam

very

connected
with
the
beginning
of
the
work
of
construction
of
the
new

state
building
which
is
to
be
erected
upon
this

a
more
desirable
grant
of

made
for

we
hope
to
place
here
a
building
that

add
dignity
to
the
location
and
worthily
represent
the
state
of

in
architectural
beauty
and
practical
usefulness
your
commission
has
been
fortunate
in
securing
for
the
architect
clarence
luce
and
the
plans
and
drawings
which
we
have
decided
upon
from
his
hand
give
promise
of
a
structure
that
the
state
we
represent
will
be
proud
of
and
we
shall
also
endeavor
to
so
furnish
it
and
utilize
its
facilities
as
to
make
it
a
serviceable
and
attractive
addition
to
the
large
number
of
state
buildings
that
are
to
be
erected
in
its
vicinity
everything
has
to
have
a
beginning
so
we
are
here
to
begin
our
work
of
actual
construction
and
it
is
specially
fitting
that
we
should
have
present
the
governor
of
new
york
to
assist
in
the
ceremonies
attendant
therewith
for
he
has
always
heartily
supported
the
project
of
the
louis
exposition
and
has
furthered
its
interests
on
every
occasion
therefore
on
behalf
of
the
new
york
state
commission
i
ask
you
governor
odell
to
honor
the
great
world
fair
of
by
performing
the
first
actual
work
upon
the
structure
we
propose
to
erect
by
turning
the
first
spadeful
of
earth
for
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
new
york
state
building
the
governor
responded
briefly
commending
the
commission
for
its
work
predicting
wonderful
benefits
to
accrue
from
the
exposition
and
prophesying
that
new
york
would
be
at
the
forefront
in
all
of
its
departments
after
which
he
lifted
the
first
spadeful
of
earth
upon
the
site
he
then
handed
the
spade
to
odell
who
lifted
another
sod
after
which
various
ladies
in
the
party
performed
the
same
act
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the

day
of
the

a
structure
thoroughly
in
keeping
with
the
dignity
and
prestige
of
the
great

was
of
the
simple
doric
order
and
the
staircase
was
augmented
by
two
memorial
columns
surrounded
by
dancing
groups
beautifully
modeled

siennas
and
with
its
crystal

the
building
were
two
reading
rooms
in
which
were
on
file
the
various
daily

and
their

one
of
these
suites
more
handsomely
furnished
than
the
others
was
called
the
suite
and
was
reserved
for
his
exclusive
use
while
not
originally
contemplated
the
third
floor
in
both
the
north
and
south
ends
of
the
building
were
finished
and
partitioned
into
rooms
for
the
use
of
the
attaches
of
the
commission
this
increased
the
capacity
of
the
building
by
eight
rooms
the
sculpture
eminent
sculptors
were
employed
to
prepare
the
statuary
for
the
building
which
was
generally
conceded
to
be
as
fine
as
any
upon
the
exposition
grounds
being
most
admirably
adapted
to
the
building
as
to
scale
there
were
two
massive
quadrigae
flanking
the
dome
typifying
the
progress
of
art
and
the
progress
of
commerce
which
were
the
work
of
phillip
martiny
to
whom
was
also
intrusted
the
work
of
preparing
the
elaborate
group
crowding
the
main
entrance
to
festival
hall
and
entitled
apollo
and
the
muses
about
the
huge
columns
flanking
the
steps
which
formed
the
approach

again
about

the
foot
of
the
grand
staircase

dancing
groups
most
gracefully
modeled
by
oscar
lenz
the
same
sculptor
was
also
responsible
for
the
figure
of
greeting
which
stood
in
the
lower
niche
at
the
north
end
of
the
building
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
state
which
appeared
frequently
in
the
scheme
of
decoration
was
by
allen
newman
the
work
of
reproduction
in
staff
of
the
models
prepared
by
the
artists
was
performed
by
barth
staak
the
lighting
the
lighting
of
the
building
throughout
was
by
electricity
and
was
particularly
effective
in
the
main
entrance
hallway
in
that
the
lights
for
the
most
part
were
concealed
behind
cornices
giving
a
very
soft
effect
and
displaying
to
the
best
advantage
the
mural
paintings
throughout
the
building
electroliers
of
special
design
were
used
in
the
main
hallway
they
took
the
form
of
quaint
florentine
lanterns
which
were
particularly
rich
in
modeling
and
were
an
important
factor
in
the
scheme
of
decoration
the
furnishings
the
furnishings
were
most
appropriate
and
harmonious
throughout
much
of
the
furniture
having
been
especially
built
for
the
place
in
which
it
was
to
stand
in
the
main
hallway
stood
massive
florentine
chairs
and
settees
with
high
backs
upholstered
in
mottled
embossed
leather
each
bearing
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
state
the
waiting
and
writing
rooms
were
appointed
and
finished
in
the
same
simple
design
which
prevailed
in
the
main
hallway
light
green
being
the
dominating
color
the
furniture
being
of
mahogany
upholstered
in
bedford
cord
the
effect
was
most
restful
to
the
tired
visitor
who
entered
the
rooms
upon
a
warm
summer
day
and
their
popularity
was
attested
by
the
number
of
exposition
visitors
both
from
new
york
and
elsewhere
who
sought
their
quiet
and
refreshing
atmosphere
to
recover
from
the
fatigue
of
exposition
sight
seeing
the
architect
the
entire
work
of
designing
the
building
sculpture
decorations
and
furniture
was
intrusted
to
clarence
luce
of
fourth
avenue
new
york
city
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
traditions
of
the
great
empire
state
luce
made
the
work
committed
to
him
a
matter
of
state
as
well
as
professional
pride
and
the
result
of
his
long
experience
coupled
with
his
artistic
temperament
and
sound
judgment
was
a
building
to
which
each
new
yorker
pointed
with
the
utmost
pride
and
which
each
stranger
praised
unstintingly
the
prompt
completion
of
the
work
so
thoroughly
and
satisfactorily
done
was
a
source
of
gratification
to
the
commission
who
at
the
first
meeting
held
in
the
building
passed
commendatory
resolutions
concerning
luce
there
were
state
buildings
which
represented
an
outlay
of
considerably
more
money
but
none
which
typified
the
commonwealth
for
which
it
stood
more
thoroughly
than
did
the
new
york
state
building
the
restaurant
a
pleasant
feature
was
a
private
restaurant
conducted
by
bayno
pindat
of
new

the
inventor
of
an
electric

in
the
basement
at
the

privileges
of
the
restaurant
were
by

only
and
were
extended
to
new
yorkers
exposition
officials
and
prominent
exposition
visitors
the
cuisine
was
most
excellent
and
throughout
the
season
appetizing
meals
were
served
on
the
spacious
verandas
at
the
north
end
of
the
building
over
which
canopies
had
been
erected
the
illumination
being
furnished
in
the
evening
by
electric
lights
contained
in
japanese
lanterns
no
restaurant
upon
the
grounds
enjoyed
a
greater
popularity
among
those
who
were
privileged
to
use
it
than
did
that
of
the
new
york
state
building
the
organ
to
the
aeolian
company
of
new
york
city
the
commission
is
indebted
for
one
of
the
features
of
the
building
this
company
placed
a
magnificent
pipe
organ
in
the
east
balcony
of
the
rotunda
and
in
the
gallery
north
of
the
grand
hall
nearly
feet
away

installed
an
echo
organ
while
a
set
of
cathedral
chimes
sounded
softly
from
still
another
distant
part
of
the
building
all
three
instruments
were
under
control
of
the
organist
at
the
console
located
upon
the

of
the
entrance
hall
and
could
be
played
either
by

by
the

the
organ
was
equipped
with
an
electric
keyboard
which
permitted
the
playing
of
all
three
instruments
or
any
single
one
as
the
operator
desired
the
main
instrument
was
contained
in
an
artistic
case
which
with
its
decorative
ornament
was
built
by
charles
and
jacob
blum
of
new
york
city
and
was
an
important
enrichment
of
the
hall
grover
a
representative
of
the
company
was
in
attendance
throughout
the
summer
and
gave
a
recital
each
day
at
three
in
the
afternoon
these
recitals
soon
came
to
be
a
feature
of
the
exposition
and
were
largely
attended
by
music
lovers

said

it
is
with
very
great
pleasure
your
new
york
state
commission
to
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
welcomes
you
in
the
new
york
state
building
here
erected
upon
the
spot
where
a
little
over
one
year
ago
you
honored
us
by
turning
the
first
spadeful
of
earth
for
the
foundation
your
commission
has
endeavored
to
carry
out
your
expressed
wishes
to
provide
for
the
people
of
new
york
who
may
visit
this
wonderful
fair
a
building
that
shall
fittingly
represent
the
state
of
new
york
and
add
its
share
with
the
other
state
buildings
to
beautifying
the
grounds
we
are
much
pleased
that
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
not
only
was
this
building
complete
in
every
detail
and
its
doors
thrown
open
for
inspection
on
the
opening
day
of
the
exposition
but
also
that
all
exhibits
under
the
control
of
your
commission
in
the
various
departments
most
of
which
are
very
much
larger
than
ever
before
shown
by
new
york
state
were
ready
and
in
place
at
the
moment
president
francis
officially
declared
that
the
great
louis
exposition
was
open
to
receive
the
world
we
wish
to
thank
president
francis
and
all
officials
connected
with
him
in
this
great
undertaking
for
the
uniform
courtesy
with
which
we
have
been
treated
and
for
the
valuable
assistance
that
has
been
so
generously
given
to
us
in
carrying
out
our
plans
it
has
been
a
most
pleasurable
task
we
have
fully
accomplished
what
we
have
sought
to
attain
there
is
nothing
lacking
in
the
realization
of
our
anticipations
as
to
whether
we
have
acted
wisely
it
is
for
you
to
judge
if
as
the
executive
head
of
our
state
it
shall
please
you
to
commend
the
results
we
submit
for
your
approval
this
will
be
the
proudest
day
in
the
history
of
the
commission
as
governor
odell
rose
to
respond
to
the
remarks
of
berri
he
received
an
ovation
for
which
he
bowed
acknowledgment
several
times
and
finally
raised
his
hand
for
silence
he
spoke
as
follows
address
of
governor
odell
president
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
are
here
to
dedicate
a
building
which
represents
the
interest
of
new
york
state
in
this
great
exposition
here
during
the
period
when
thousands
shall
visit
these
grounds
those
who
owe
allegiance
to
the
empire
state
will
find
a
place
which
will
typify
to
them
their
home
and
impress
them
let
us
hope
to
a
greater
degree
with
the
vastness
of
our
state
and
of
the
position
which
it
occupies
in
our
commonwealth
of
nations
to
those
who
have
been
intrusted
with
the
work
we
owe
thanks
for
the
conception
of
their
duty
and
for
this
magnificent
edifice
which
in
its
strength
and
beauty
of
architecture
is
symbolical
of
the
empire
state
in
every
phase
of
our
nation
history
in
all
that
has
made
it
great
and
powerful
and
respected
new
york
has
been
both
conservative
and
wise
in
the
aid
which
it
offered
powerful
in
the
resources
which
it
furnished
in
the
building
up
of
our
republic
from
the
time
when
the
courage
and
patriotism
of
our
forefathers
wrought
out
the
nation
down
to
the
latest
acquisition
of
our
territory
there
is
no
page
of
history
which
does
not
tell
of
the
devotion
and
statesmanship
of
new
citizens
it
is
always
a
remarkable
event
in
the
history
of
the
world
when
one
nation
disposes
of
any
part
of
its
domain
to
another
through
peaceful
methods
war
has
almost
always
been
the
means
through
which
nations
have
expanded
and
pushed
forward
their
boundary
lines
trade
requiring
an
outlet
has
more
frequently
been
the
cause
of
bloodshed
than
almost
any
other
national
or
international
question
that
our
country
therefore
at
an
early
period
in
its
history
should
have
been
able
through
peaceful
means
to
secure
the
vast
domain
beyond
the
mississippi
is
a
tribute
to
the
statesmanlike
policies
of
those
who
conceived
its
purchase
true
it
may
be
that
the
wars
of
other
nations
aided
in
its
consummation
but
it
is
also
equally
true
that
the
man
who
was
most
directly
responsible
for
the
purchase
was
a
son
of
the
empire
state
nor
did
the
results
of
this
early
diplomatic
victory
stop
here
the
principle
thus
established
has
frequently
led
to
more
peaceful
methods
of
adjusting
questions
of
territorial
boundary
both
in
our
own
and
other
countries
it
may
be
that
much
that
has
since
been
accomplished
through
arbitration
is
but
the
evolution
of
this
idea
and
it
may
lead
let
us
hope
to
the
time
when
such
questions
will
no
longer
render
necessary
the
arbitrament
of
the
sword
it
was
proper
therefore
that
our
state
in
its
dignity
with
its
conservatism
and
with
its
intense
patriotism
should
be
among
the
first
to
contribute
of
its
means
to
make
of
this
exposition
the
grand
success
which
it
promises
with
each
succeeding
international
exposition
the
world
becomes
wiser
artisans
more
skillful
the
contributions
to
science
and
art
more
valuable
in
a
word
they
raise
the
standard
of
civilization
and
hasten
the
time
when
all
men
shall
pay
homage
to
the
ruler
of
the
universe
as
inventions
are
developed
which
make
the
worker
more
effective
which
broaden
the
field
of
usefulness
there
come
responsibilities
and
problems
which
require
education
and
discernment
to
meet
and
solve
under
the
softened
touch
of
christianity
religion
and
education
there
should
come
about
a
universal
brotherhood
of
man
broad
enough
in
scope
to
embrace
all
humanity
in
all
the
work
of
the
world
in
all
that
is
for
the
development
of
man
in
everything
that
holds
out
promise
to
the
future
new
york
state
we
may
justly
say
if
not
the
leader
is
at
least
in
the
fore
ranks
its
broad
acres
are
rich
and
fertile
and
the
commerce
of
the
world
enters
at
its
ports
the
manufacturer
finds
willing
hands
with
remunerative
wages
striving
to
produce
that
which
is
necessary
for
our
comfort
and
which
adds
so
much
to
the
wealth
of
the
nation
its
laws
are
broad
and
ample
in
their
scope
with
no
distinction
as
between
man
and
man
and
beneficent
in
their
operation
while
our
citizens
evince
impulses
which
are
worthy
of
emulation
by
all
those
who
believe
in
the
future
of
our
republic
we
have
more
of
wealth
and
a
greater
population
than
any
other
state
within
the
union
our
cities
are
cosmopolitan
in
character
made
up
of
representatives
of
all
nations
but
so
nicely
adjusted
are
our
laws
that
they
are
assimilated
into
our
population
and
become
americans
among
americans
actuated
by
a
common
patriotism
and
a
common
desire
for
the
continued
development
of
our
land
in
these
great
halls
in
these
magnificent
buildings
devoted
to
art
to
education
to
mechanics
and
to
agriculture
exhibits
are
to
be
found
which
are
on
a
par
if
they
do
not
excel
those
of
other
nations
the
advancement
of
new
york
however
is
but
typical
of
every
other
state
in
the
union
in
the
continued
prosperity
of
which
all
are
equally
interested
a
nation
of
separate
states
there
is
no
dividing
line
of
envy
between
them
no
wish
except
for
the
prosperity
and
development
of
each
a
common
hope
for
a
common
country
how
necessary
it
is
therefore
that
in
all
that
has
to
do
with
society
a
broad
catholic
spirit
should
dominate
and
control
ours
is
not
a
country
of
classes
but
one
of
equality
a
country
whose
aim
is
the
education
of
its
citizens
it
is
our
common
object
to
perpetuate
the
principles
of
american
independence
anything
that
retards
human
progress
or
that
would
make
of
a
man
a
mere
machine
without
brains
is
to
be
deprecated
our
object
should
be
to
encourage
and
to
promote
thrift
and
to
instill
into
the
mind
of
every
citizen
a
desire
for
advancement
in
this
direction
our
state
will
be
found
always
in
the
forefront
and
the
evidence
of
her
greatness
will
be
measured
rather
by
the
intelligence
of
her
citizens
than
by
mere
accumulation
of
wealth
therefore
that
which
protects
labor
which
encourages
capital
should
be
the
aim
of
modern
legislation
while
we
participate
in
the
celebration
of
this
great
national
event
as
we
mark
our
progress
along
every
line
we
feel
a
natural
pride
in
all
that
has
been
done
in
other
states
in
all
that
has
been
accomplished
by
other
people
as
we
look
into
the
future
as
we
consider
its
possibilities
let
us
hope
that
our
nation
will
never
forget
that
this
government
is
one
by
the
people
and
that
its
power
and
influence
among
the
nations
of
the
world
will
continue
only
so
long
as
due
weight
and
consideration
is
given
to
the
rights
of
individuals
while
rejoicing
as
citizens
of
new
york
let
us
hope
for
the
continuance
of
those
policies
and
principles
which
have
made
our
nation
prosperous
and
let
us
not
forget
that
moderation
and
conservatism
should
be
the
measure
of
our
efforts
and
all
that
we
do
shall
be
for
the
advancement
of
all
the
people
the
citizens
of
new
york
extend
their
congratulations
to
the
people
of
the
west
and
northwest
we
hope
that
from
this
great
exposition
there
shall
come
a
closer
communication
between
all
the
people
of
the
earth
a
broadening
of
human
effort
the
advancement
of
civilization
and
a
growing
respect
for
our
country
and
our
flag
which
will
make
us
a
power
for
the
good
and
peace
of
the
world
it
is
a
great
pleasure
for
me
to
accept
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
new
york
this
magnificent
building
and
again
to
congratulate
you
as
the
president
of
the
commission
and
the
architect
who

wrought
this
wonderful
work
for
the
painstaking
care
that
you
have
exercised
in
the
development
of
new
york
interests
in
this
great
exposition
during
the
address
of
the
governor
president
francis
quietly
entered
and
was
introduced
at
its
conclusion
he
was
warmly
received
and
made
a
characteristic
address

paid
a
warm
tribute
to
the
empire
state
and
her
chief
executive
and
complimented
the
state
commission
upon
the
work
it
had
performed
and
spoke
of
the
new
york
state
building
as
one
of
the
social
centers
of
the
exposition
his
remarks
in
part
follow
your
distinguished
son
robert
livingston
was
the
man
who
first
negotiated
for
the
purchase
of
louisiana
no
exposition
would
be
complete
without
a
representation
from
the
empire
state
the
exposition
management
has
already
pointed
with
pride
to
the
new
york
building
the
social
functions
of
which
have
been
among
the
marked
attractions
of
the
exposition
i
am
here
to
thank
new

for
her
material
contribution
to
the
world
fair
but
for
the
spirit
her
citizens
have
given
to
this
exposition
we
of
the
west
flatter
ourselves
that
we
have
arrived
at
that
stage
of
our
progress
when
we
can
invite
every
people
on
the
globe
to
come
and
see
for
themselves

a
century
of
western
civilization

accomplished

to

to
all
who
have
honored
us
with
their

here
it
was
on
this
site
upon
may
governor
odell
lifted
the
first
spadeful
of
earth
where
this
beautiful
structure
has
since
been
erected
upon
that
occasion
new
york
was
represented
by
our
chief
executive
his
staff
and
troops
numbering
nearly
fifteen
hundred
men
from
all
branches
of
the
military
and
naval
service
of
the
state
on
last
april
thirtieth
this
building
sumptuously
appointed
was
formally
opened
to
the
public
i
may
say
with
pardonable
pride
that
the
report
which
the
commission
made
at
that
time
showed
that
not
only
was
our
building
complete
in
every
detail
but
all
of
the
state
exhibits
as
well
were
ready
for
inspection
the
work
of
our
commission
has
been
along
pleasant
lines
and
we
have
been
constantly
stimulated
by
hearty
support
from
the
exposition
authorities
it
is
fitting
that
we
should
express
our
sincere
appreciation
to
president
francis
and
the
sterling
coterie
of
men
with
whom
he
is
surrounded
for
the
aid
and
assistance
which
they
have
so
willingly
rendered
this
commission
in
every
way
our
governor
has
taken
a
warm
interest
in
new
york
participation
at
this
fair
and
on
many
occasions
he
has
made
manifest
his
desire
that
new
york
representation
should
be
ample
and
complete
in
every
particular
in
many
of
the
magnificent
places
such
as
education
agriculture
horticulture
forestry
fish
and
game
mines
and
metallurgy
our
state
has
collective
exhibits
which
show
her
varied
resources
in
this
beautiful
structure
will
be
evidenced
further
proof
of
new
york
generous
participation
in
this
great
exposition
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
has
a
deep
interest
for
new
york
for
one
of
the
principal
figures
instrumental
in
bringing
about
that
purchase
was
livingston
a
distinguished
son
of
the
empire
state
and
it
was
he
who
negotiated
the
treaty
and
was
first
to
sign
it
and
yet
the
real
authors
of
that
great
transaction
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
were
neither
jefferson
madison
nor
livingston
and
i
think
historians
will
agree
with
me
when
i
say
it
was
more
the
influence
of
those
hardy
frontiersmen
of
kentucky
who
demanded
free
navigation
for
the
magnificent
inland
river
which
rolls
by
us
in
its
eternal
flow
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
influence
of
those
men
the
vanguard
of
civilization
could
not
be
disregarded
by
those
who
were
at
the
head
of
our
governmental
affairs
more
than
a
century
ago
then
the
more
we
look
at
this
transaction
the
more
evident
it
is
that
the
outcome
of
it
was
due
to
that
man
whose
shadow
even
now
falls
sharply
athwart
the
whole
continent
of
europe
napoleon
bonaparte
it
was
his
ambition
which
threw
into
the
grasp
of
the
infant
republic
the
splendid
empire
out
of
which
have
been
carved
twelve
sovereign
states
and
two
territories
at
that
time
napoleon
uttered
one
of
those
expressions
which
is
important
in
its
prophecy
he
said
will
be
objected
to
me
that
the
americans
of
two
or
three
centuries
hence
may
be
found
too
powerful
for
europe
but
my
foresight
does
not
embrace
such
remote
fears
besides
we
may
hereafter
expect
rivalries
among
members
of
the
union
confederacies
that
are
called
perpetual
last
only
until
one
of
the
contending
parties
finds
it
is
to
its
interests
to
break
them
it
is
to
prevent
the
danger
to
which
the
colossal
power
of
england
subjects
us
that
i
would
provide
such
a
remedy
no
such
vision
of
the
future
came
to
our
american
statesmen
many
of
whom
bitterly
opposed
the
purchase
of
the
louisiana
territory
when
the
bill
came
up
for
discussion
on
the
floor
of
congress
josiah
quincy
afterwards
mayor
of
boston
and
for
many
years
president
of
harvard
college
said
speaking
of
the
incorporation
in
the
union
of
the
territory
of
louisiana
appears
to
me
that
this
measure
would
justify
revolution
in
this
country
i
am
compelled
to
declare
it
as
my
deliberate
opinion
that
if
this
bill
passes
the
bonds
of
this
union
are
virtually
dissolved
that
the
states
which
compose
it
are
free
from
their
moral
obligation
and
that
as
it
will
be
the
right
of
all
so
it
will
be
the
duty
of
some
to
prepare
definitely
for
a
separation
amicably
if
they
can
violently
if
they
must
he
said
further
this
bill
passes
it
is
a
death
blow
to
the
constitution
strange
words
indeed
in
our
ears
at
this
time
and
it
shows
that
the
american
statesmen
of
those
days
had
not
the
imagination
of
napoleon
what
has
this
purchase
meant
to
new
york
to
have
in
this
union
this
great
empire
what
has
it
meant
to
the
union
itself
to
have
this
splendid
territory
incorporated
in
it
it
has
meant
for
new
york
prosperity
and
increased
commerce
to
the
people
of
all
our
land
and
furnished
homes
for
the
sons
and
daughters
of
new
york
the
states
carved
out
of
that
great
empire
have
all
borne
their
share
in
the
heat
of
our
national
life
and
they
have
contributed
immeasurably
to
the
nation
growth
and
development
and
we
have
come
in
this
country
notwithstanding
the
immense
separation
and
diversity
of
interests
to
work
together
under
one
flag
with
one
interest
for
a
common
country
and
this
great
exposition
should
teach
not
only
us
of
the
east
but
of
all
other
sections
of
the
country
that
we
should
avoid
the
danger
of
finding
ourselves
separate
in
sentiment
from
one
another
in
this
great
western
empire
we
all
take
a
common
interest
and
the
success
of
this
exposition
redounds
to
the
credit
and
honor
not
only
of
the
men
who
have
carried
it
to
such
successful
issue
but
upon
the
whole
country
we
all
shine
in
the
reflected
glory
of
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
which
shows
the
mark
of
human
progress
it
is
indeed
the
greatest
of
all
international
fairs
and
a
lasting
credit
to
the
artistic
skill
of
the
men
who
planned
and
executed
it
it
is
the
culmination
of
all
that
has
been
done
in
the
wide
expanse
of
territory
purchased
from
france
in
and
the
achievements
of
all
nations
in
the
world
since
that
day
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
early
oriental
fairs
in
the
east
which
were
perhaps
the
early
ancestors
of
this
great
exposition
and
all
honor
and
credit
and
glory
is
due
the
men
who
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
carrying
this
great
enterprise
to
such
a
magnificent
culmination
it
represents
american
skill
american
enterprise
american
endeavor
and
its
influence
will
be
felt
upon
this
country
long
after
those
men
who
have
played
their
successful
part
in
this
great
moving
drama
have
passed
from
earth
words
are
inadequate
to
fittingly
describe
the
beauties
of
this
magnificent
exposition
it
is
individual
effort
as
well
as
concerted
effort
which
has
brought
about
these
splendid
results
it
is
one
of
the
brightest
pages
in
american
history
and
what
glorious
memories
a
perusal
of
these
pages
arouse
we
can
turn
the
pages
of
recorded
history
from
the
time
when
the
boats
of
the
adventurous
genoese
unfolded
their
white
wings
in
the
harbor
of
palos
and
sped
across
the
unknown
seas
to
bring
back
upon
their
return
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
new
world
far
across
the
wide
waste
of
waters
in
fancy
we
picture
that
sturdy
band
kneeling
with
columbus
richly
attired
upon
the
tropic
sands
while
over
them
floats
the
blood
and
gold
banner
of
spain
as
the
priest
clothed
in
vestments
of
his
office
asks
the
blessings
of
almighty
god
upon
the
land
which
columbus
claims
in
the
name
of
the
house
of
castile
in
the
background
we
see
waving
palms
and
men
who
gaze
with
awe
upon
the
white
discoverers
in
another
scene
we
see
the
cold
wintry
waves
surge
and
dash
around
the
frail
craft
fighting
its
way
across
dark
tempestuous
seas
from
plymouth
the
little
bark
tossed
like
a
feather
here
and
there
until
she
lands
on
that
coast
known
as
new
england
we
see
that
little
colony
freedom
seed
germinate
and
thrive
first
the
grain
then
the
tender
plant
ever
exposed
to
severe
conditions
then
matured
into
the
oak
of
a
giant
nation
we
see
those
brave
colonists
who
have
planted
the
banner
of
human
liberty
upon
the
inhospitable
shores
push
ever
onward
ever
extending
the
fringe
of
civilization
struggling
against
disheartening
obstacles
fighting
wild
beasts
and
savage
men
but
pushing
on
with
indomitable
courage
we
see
the
historical
gathering
at
philadelphia
resulting
in
that
document
embodying
jefferson
superb
crystallization
of
popular
opinion
that
men
are
created
free
and
equal
and
endowed
with
certain
inalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
that
american
magna
charta
which
swept
away
forever
the
will
of
kings
in
this
land
the
people
became
the
rulers
and
the
accident
of
birth
carried
no
rank
conferred
no
privilege
we
see
the
loosely
joined
colonies
building
a
nation
which
contained
these
elements
of
greatness
little
dreamed
of
by
those
hardy
pioneers
who
so
generously
gave
up
their
offering
of
blood
on
freedom
altar
the
kaleidoscope
still
turns
we
see
those
intrepid
founders
of
the
school
of
liberty
pushing
their
lines
ever
onward
across
rivers
deserts
over
mountains
clad
with
eternal
snow
until
the
golden
shores
of
california
gladden
the
eye
of
our
valiant
explorers
then
a
pause
and
over
land
and
sea
hang
dark
clouds
of
fratricidal
war
four
long
years
through
the
valleys
and
over
the
mountains
of
the
southland
surges
the
red
tide
of
battle
the
days
were
dark
and
full
of
gloom
when
lo
the
clouds
parted
and
the
heavens
again
were
blue
the
nation
had
been
born
anew
and
on
the
fair
pages
of
her
history
appear
no
longer
the
dark
stain
of
human
slavery
the
strong
arm
of
enterprise
quickly
washed
away
the
red
stain
of
war
the
word
had
a
deeper
and
more
sacred
meaning
than
before
and
the
nation
was
on
the
indestructible
foundation
of
national
unity
the
blocks
were
laid
in
the
cement
of
fraternal
esteem
still
the
picture
which
we
see
revolves
across
the
waters
of
the
pacific
america
sweeps
towards
the
fulfillment
of
her
world
wide
destiny
the
stars
and
stripes
wave
over
the
palace
of
the
kings
in
honolulu
still
again
the
nation
sword
is
unsheathed
in
the
cause
of
human
liberty
and
the
last
vestige
of
spanish
power
is
swept
from
the
new
world
the
thunder
of
dewey
guns
awakens
us
to
the
fact
that
the
american
banner
is
planted
into
the
far
orient
there
to
stay
forever
and
under
its
protecting
folds
manifold
blessings
are
carried
to
the
people
of
those
islands
lying
in
the
purple
spheres
of
summer
seas
while
the
drum
of
all
american
progress
is
heard
around
the
world
it
too
may
be
truthfully
said
that
the
sun
never
sets
upon
the
soil
over
which
freedom
banner
proudly
floats
for
when
the
light
of
the
dying
day
is
fading
from
porto
rican
hills
the
golden
rays
of
the
morning
sun
are
reflected
upon
the
shimmering
folds
of
old
glory
on
the
gray
old
battlements
of
manila
it
is
indeed
inspiring
the
history
of
this
great
nation
guided
to
its
ultimate
issue
as
a
stately
ship
is
wafted
over
the
seas
to
the
harbor
of
its
destination
i
wonder
if
in
this
ceaseless
struggle
for
gold
and
gain
we
pause
long
enough
to
study
the
true
character
of
those
men
to
whose
valorous
deeds
we
owe
so
much
those
men
who
planted
the
tree
of
human
liberty
so
deep
that
even
the
shock
of
revolution
of
succeeding
wars
could
not
uproot
it
those
men
who
demanded
of
jefferson
a
free
mississippi
and
who
made
this
exposition
possible
all
honor
to
those
heroes
who
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
days
which
tried
souls
who
in
the
gloom
and
suffering
of
valley
forge
saw
in
the
distance
the
rainbow
of
hope
shining
over
the
dark
clouds
of
defeat
they
saw
the
light
of
a
great
nation
which
would
serve
as
a
beacon
in
the
world
progress
and
a
refuge
for
the
persecuted
of
the
nations
of
earth
all
races
contributed
to
the
founding
of
this
beloved
country
the
roster
of
the
revolution
is
filled
with
names
which
show
that
the
liberty
loving
of
all
european
nations
gave
up
a
generous
offering
of
blood
on
freedom
altar
in
our
veins
courses
blood
of
all
nations
and
it
is
the
healthy
commingling
of
that
blood
which
has
produced
a
race
of
world
conquerors
it
has
produced
the
men
who
have
made
possible
this
great
exposition
we
have
been
placed
in
the
world
crucible
have
been
melted
in
the
glowing
heat
of
a
nascent
life
and
have
been
forged
into
a
weapon
which
shall
carve
the
world
our
ideals
are
worthy
the
hopes
and
aspirations
of
the
nation
devoted
to
justice
and
love
ideals
which
shall
be
the
steadfast
inspirer
of
nations
and
individuals
to
uprightness
to
justice
and
to
honor
the
presiding
officer
then
expressed
regret
at
the
unavoidable
absence
of
president
francis
on
account
of
bereavement
in
his
family
he
introduced
judge
franklin
ferriss
general
counsel
to
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
company
who
delivered
the
following
address
address
of
judge
ferriss
i
regret
extremely
for
your
sake
and
his
that
the
brilliant
man
who
stands
at
the
head
of
this
exposition
can
not
be
here
to
greet
you
in
person
still
i
must
admit
that
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
i
owe
to
his
misfortune
and
yours
the
very
great
privilege
of
appearing
before
you
to
extend
a
welcome
to
the
people
of
my
native
state
the
president
of
the
exposition
bids
me
say
to
you
that
there
has
been
no
occasion
on
these
grounds
that
there
will
be
none
in
the
future
in
which
he
would
more
gladly
participate
than
this
the
exposition
management
feels
under
peculiar
obligations
to
the
state
of
new
york
we
are
indebted
largely
to
her
prompt
and
liberal
for
the
high
stand
which
the
exposition
has
taken
we
are
indebted
to
the
governor
to
the
new
york
commission
to
the
gracious
hostesses
of
this
building
to
the
splendid
woman
who
has
with
rare
tact
and
dignity
with
the
exposition
as
president
of
the
board
of
lady
managers
in
the
building
of
this
exposition
science
invention
art
manufacture
the
field
the
forest
the
mine
the
air
and
the
water
have
contributed
their
choicest
treasures
how
well
we
have
succeeded
in
presenting
them
you
must
judge
but
i
wish
to
say
to
you
that
no
matter
how
high
a
standard
we
have
reached
still
more
important
than
all
else
is
the
representation
upon
these
grounds
of
our
splendid
american
man
and
womanhood
no
man
can
walk
about
this
plateau
of
states
view
these
beautiful
structures
see
the
people
coming
together
from
the
north
and
the
south
the
east
and
the
west
uniting
in
common
loyalty
and
respect
for
our
institutions
without
feeling
his
heart
swell
with
pride
and
gratitude
it
is
no
disparagement
to
our
sister
states
for
me
a
loyal
son
of
new
york
to
say
that
it
is
most
fitting
that
the
empire
state
should
be
here
also
in
the
beauty
of
her
building
the
character
of
her
exhibits
and
the
magnificent
representation
of
her
people
i
am
proud
of
the
state
of
new
york
proud
of
her
history
her
scholars
her
statesmen
her
soldiers
proud
of
her
material
prosperity
proud
of
the
great
metropolis
through
whose
gates
thunders
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
i
love
the
state
of
new
york
her
broad
and
fertile
valleys
her
stately
rivers
the
lakes
which
glisten
like
jewels
on
her
bosom
her
mountains
which
rear
their
tops
to
the
clouds
but
most
of
all
i
love
the
quiet
life
of
the
country
home
the
honesty
and
industry
of
the
plain
people
our
old
home
who
can
forget
it
the
great
barn
with
its
huge
beams
and
fragrant
mows
of
hay
the
sparkling
brook
whose
shining
shallows
bathed
my
naked
feet
the
broad
meadow
with
its
fence
corners
of
luscious
berries
the
old
schoolhouse
whose
desks
are
impressed
with
generations
of
was
there
ever
so
sweet
a
draught
as
that
which
we
drew
from
the
shining
depths
of
the
old
well
and
yet
the
country
boy
grew
restless
with
his
ear
to
the
ground
he
heard
the
distant
hum
of
industry
he
heard
the
tramp
of
a
million
feet
in
the
great
cities
he
felt
that
the
battle
of
life
was
on
and
that
he
must
take
his
place
in
the
struggle
and
so
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
old
home
ah
how
many
grave
faced
fathers
and
tender
sweet
faced
mothers
have
watched
their
boys
one
by
one
go
out
into
the
world
and
have
turned
back
in
solitude
cheered
by
an
occasional
visit
an
occasional
letter
to
wait
until
their
days
should
be
fulfilled
and
how
many
of
us
must
now
say
that
their
days
have
been
fulfilled
and
that
a
simple
stone
marks
their
last
resting
place
in
the
village
churchyard
what
have
we
gained
by
this
contentment
they
had
it
respect
of
our
fellowmen
they
had
it
success
in
life
they
had
it
true
their
fortunes
were
small
and
yet
they
had
no
clutching
fear
that
speculation
fraud
or
treachery
would
rob
them
of
the
fruit
of
a
toil
and
they
had
an
abiding
faith
that
there
would
be
provision
for
the
years
to
come
aye
that
there
would
be
provision
for
the
last
journey
to
that
land
where
according
to
their
simple
faith
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
i
will
yield
to
no
man
in
loyalty
to
the
state
of
my
adoption
but
who
can
chide
me
if
my
heart
clings
to
the
home
of
my
childhood
to
the
graves
of
my
forefathers
if
we
who
have
left
the
old
home
to
build
a
new
one
in
the
west
can
be
faithful
to
the
traditions
of
our
childhood
if
we
can
bequeath
to
our
children
the
lessons
of
industry
honesty
and
economy
which
our
fathers
gave
to
us
we
shall
do
more
to
honor
the
state
of
new
york
than
we
could
do
by
rearing
marble
to
the
skies
the
presiding
officer
then
introduced
honorable
benjamin
odell
governor
of
the
state
who
received
a
great
ovation
it
being
some
time
before
the
governor
was
able
to
proceed
with
his
remarks
his
speech
was
punctuated
with
liberal
applause
he
said
address
of
governor
odell
the
diplomacy
which
led
up
to
the
acquisition
of
the
louisiana
territory
furnishes
one
of
the
most
interesting
incidents
in
the
history
the
establishment
of
a
republic
devoted
to
the
interests
of
and
affording
liberty
of
conscience
and
freedom
of
action
to
its
citizens
was
an
experiment
in
government
which
could
not
have
succeeded
if
any
restraint
had
been
placed
upon
that
liberty
or
if
its
constitution
had
not
been
broad
enough
to
meet
the
demands
of
a
growing
country
from
the
settlement
of
america
down
to
the
revolutionary
war
sanguinary
strife
had
been
the
lot
of
the
american
people
the
thrifty
dutch
and
the
stolid
determined
sought
not
in
this
country
a
mere
temporary
home
for
unlike
the
spaniards
their
dream
was
not
of
gold
but
rather
their
hope
was
for
a
liberty
so
broad
and
catholic
in
its
character
that
it
would
grow
with
succeeding
years
and
make
certain
that
peace
they
had
sought
for
in
vain
in
the
land
of
their
birth
the
earlier
colonial
and
indian
wars
had
drawn
upon
the
resources
and
heroism
of
our
forefathers
hardship
and
toil
had
imbued
them
with
a
consciousness
of
their
strength
and
instilled
into
them
that
spirit
of
independence
which
enabled
them
after
long
years
of
strife
to
establish
our
republic
it
was
this
people
after
having
gained
their
independence
in
the
belief
that
foreign
complications
were
forever
at
an
end
who
at
the
close
of
the
revolution
turned
their
attention
to
peaceful
pursuits
and
endeavored
to
meet
every
requirement
of
a
growing
country
with
characteristic
skill
and
industry
they
began
the
development
of
those
tremendous
resources
of
our
country
the
measure
of
which
is
almost
beyond
human
conception
here
under
liberal
laws
and
wise
administration
the
people
found
that
which
had
been
heretofore
lacking
in
the
government
of
the
world
invention
had
not
yet
made
possible
the
intercommunication
facilities
which
we
of
the
present
enjoy
upon
water
transit
therefore
they
were
obliged
to
depend
for
an
outlet
for
the
commerce
of
their
western
territory
the
barriers
which
were
sought
to
be
interposed
to
communication
over
the
mighty
river
which
rises
in
the
northwest
brought
forth
vigorous
protests
from
those
who
had
just
begun
to
cultivate
its
fertile
fields
angry
passions
were
aroused
and
the
people
of
our
country
who
had
been
so
successful
in
carving
out
the
republic
demanded
that
this
barrier
should
be
removed
livingston
and
monroe
clothed
only
with
power
to
effect
a
treaty
which
should
insure
this
right
of
transit
with
no
possible
opportunity
of
quick
communication
with
their
government
took
upon
themselves
the
responsibility
which
brought
to
a
successful
consummation
the
relinquishment
of
this
vast
territory
thus
was
brought
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
a
question
which
had
never
been
contemplated
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
that
instrument
had
been
the
production
of
the
wisest
men
of
the
times
they
had
successfully
met
the
problem
of
drawing
into
an
indissoluble
union
the
thirteen
states
many
of
which
were
acting
under
peculiar
laws
which
were
contrary
to
the
declaration
of
independence
under
which
the
battles
for
freedom
had
been
fought
and
won
while
there
was
authority
for
the
admission
of
new
states
there
was
no
constitutional
permission
for
the
purchase
of
territory
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
perform
acts
of
sovereignty
had
not
yet
been
passed
upon
and
there
was
grave
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
ratifying
the
treaty
without
a
constitutional
amendment
when
we
look
over
the
results
which
have
followed
this
expansion
of
our
country
when
we
calculate
our
manifest
growth
in
population
in
wealth
and
in
industry
all
of
these
appear
insignificant
beside
the
result
which
was
accomplished
in
showing
to
the
world
that
we
were
living
under
a
constitution
broad
enough
in
its
provisions
to
be
so
interpreted
as
to
insure
success
to
popular
government
that
jefferson
and
his
advisers
acted
wisely
in
so
construing
their
power
at
that
time
is
undoubted
if
there
were
no
other
achievements
of
that
wonderful
administration
then
this
alone
would
suffice
to
make
it
a
memorable
one
doubt
lack
of
courage
and
insincere
opposition
are
always
the
refuge
of
a
coward
here
was
a
nation
demanding
that
which
was
necessary
for
its
trade
desirous
of
reaching
a
solution
through
peaceful
means
if
possible
but
determined
to
acquire
it
at
all
hazards
if
necessary
there
was
no
question
as
to
the
consent
of
those
whom
we
took
over
and
to
whom
we
gave
the
protection
of
our
flag
or
as
to
nice
points
of
constitutionality
when
the
greater
object
in
view
was
the
onward
progress
of
civilization
the
building
up
of
hope
and
the
fulfillment
of
our
destiny
as
a
nation
to
perpetuate
those
principles
which
mean
so
much
in
the
redeeming
of
the
world
the
exigencies
of
a
later
war
found
a
precedent
in
the
courage
of
jefferson
and
enabled
lincoln
to
wipe
from
the
escutcheon
of
state
the
blot
of
slavery
which
had
too
long
tarnished
it
that
the
acquisition
of
this
territory
was
accomplished
through
peaceful
means
rather
than
by
bloodshed
was
another
triumph
for
civilization
while
wars
have
come
since
and
may
come
in
the
future
the
plan
of
arbitration
which
has
been
adopted
so
generally
by
this
and
other
nations
may
perhaps
have
had
its
inception
in
this
peaceful
solution
of
a
burning
and
important
question
to
this
country
our
union
now
is
one
that
is
composed
of
commonwealths
bound
together
by
all
that
means
common
interest
the
common
weal
and
common
protection
of
all
the
people
it
leads
to
the
hope
that
when
the
representatives
of
all
of
the
states
have
decreed
by
a
majority
that
which
is
for
the
best
interest
of
the
whole
country
then
these
questions
should
no
longer
be
the
subject
of
partisanship
or
party
differences
but
the
government
should
have
the
loyal
support
of
all
who
believe
in
america
and
her
future
the
same
laws
govern
us
the
same
protection
should
be
and
is
accorded
to
every
citizen
and
there
is
no
individual
or
isolated
community
that
does
not
share
in
the
prosperity
of
all
others
whose
interests
are
on
the
same
plane
of
equality
for
a
time
natural
advantages
may
unduly
favor
one
section
of
the
country
but
the
accumulation
of
wealth
brings
about
the
development
of
the
natural
resources
by
which
other
sections
are
built
up
and
their
people
share
in
the
general
prosperity
our
state
perhaps
has
benefited
more
through
the
development
of
the
west
and
the
northwest
territory
than
almost
any
other
commonwealth
the
natural
valleys
which
permitted
the
building
of
the
erie
canal
and
the
connection
of
the
great
lakes
with
the
harbor
of
new
york
brought
this
territory
in
close
communication
with
the
atlantic
seaboard
the
growing
demands
of
the
world
led
to
the
cultivation
of
the
fertile
fields
of
the
west
the
development
of
the
mines
and
the
building
up
of
cities
and
manufactures
until
we
have
other
ports
whose
facilities
have
been
increased
by
the
improvement
of
waterways
and
the
building
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
of
railroad
while
there
may
be
an
apparent
decrease
in
some
localities
and
a
corresponding
benefit
in
others
yet
so
intimate
are
our
connections
and
associations
that
the
prosperity
of
one
instead
of
being
a
menace
to
the
growth
of
any
other
locality
really
aids
in
building
it
up
so
diversified
are
our
interests
so
skillful
our
people
that
we
may
compare
the
whole
union
to
a
great
workshop
one
vast
cultivated
field
of
industry
all
laboring
not
for
the
advancement
of
separate
cities
or
localities
but
for
the
continued
growth
of
our
common
country
it
is
only
through
ignorance
that
people
have
a
misconception
of
these
truths
the
development
of
the
human
mind
is
no
less
important
than
the
development
of
the
physical
condition
of
man
his
education
therefore
is
a
paramount
duty
of
the
state
and
his
protection
against
the
weakening
of
his
physical
condition
is
equally
important
that
legislation
has
recognized
these
facts
is
shown
in
laws
not
only
of
the
nation
but
of
each
individual
state
which
seek
to
guard
and
protect
the
youth
against
unwise
labor
which
seek
to
instill
into
his
mind
that
intelligence
which
comes
only
from
wise
and
broad
educational
facilities
every
able
bodied
citizen
of
our
country
is
an
asset
and
those
who
through
weakness
however
painful
the
admission
may
be
are
incapacitated
from
labor
must
be
entered
upon
the
debit
side
of
the
national
ledger
therefore
the
laws
that
guard
against
burdensome
toil
too
long
hours
of
labor
and
against
ignorance
are
not
only
humanitarian
in
their
character
but
are
best
calculated
to
promote
the
interest
of
all
the
people
in
the
division
of
society
those
who
labor
and
those
who
represent
capital
should
always
be
in
accord
and
the
demands
of
either
should
never
trespass
upon
the
rights
of
the
other
it
is
too
frequently
the
case
that
through
misunderstanding
of
our
laws
and
the
higher
economical
conditions
that
friction
does
arise
between
these
two
great
elements
of
society
the
right
of
every
man
to
sell
his
products
or
his
labor
in
the
best
market
is
unquestioned
and
any
interference
with
this
principle
of
sound
government
is
a
menace
to
the
republic
itself
we
are
reaching
a
point
in
our
history
when
conservative
and
wise
judgment
must
prevail
and
the
common
sense
of
the
people
dictates
such
a
solution
of
these
problems
as
will
meet
every
demand
that
is
in
harmony
with
sound
government
our
own
state
has
taken
long
steps
in
advance
upon
these
questions
and
to
us
with
whom
these
differences
more
frequently
occur
the
people
will
look
for
wise
deliberations
and
conclusions
every
man
should
be
a
part
of
the
government
he
should
feel
it
to
be
as
much
his
duty
to
respond
to
civic
responsibilities
as
do
those
living
under
a
monarchy
whose
early
tuition
instills
in
them
the
belief
that
they
owe
the
best
part
of
their
lives
to
the
military
service
of
their
government
as
they
are
undeterred
by
fear
of
death
or
disaster
so
should
our
young
men
be
undeterred
from
entering
public
life
by
calumny
villification
and
abuse
which
they
see
too
frequently
and
too
unjustly
bestowed
upon
others
new
york
is
here
by
its
official
representatives
to
testify
first
to
its
loyalty
to
the
purposes
for
which
this
exposition
was
conceived
to
show
the
people
of
the
west
that
in
their
progress
we
are
interested
and
that
to
them
we
look
for
such
returns
in
dividends
upon
the
stock
of
patriotism
as
will
give
to
our
nation
men
of
energy
of
right
impulses
to
you
we
owe
much
and
from
you
we
expect
much
our
efforts
will
be
to
aid
you
in
every
laudable
undertaking
to
stand
behind
you
in
all
that
means
the
prosperity
of
our
common
country
you
have
here
an
exposition
of
which
you
may
be
justly
proud
nothing
like
it
has
ever
been
known
in
the
annals
of
the
world
skilled
workmen
from
all
parts
of
the
earth
are
here
to
aid
in
its
success
here
you
witness
not
only
the
steady
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
sciences
the
arts
and
agriculture
but
you
have
before
you
also
exhibits
from
some
of
the
possessions
which
have
recently
come
under
our
control
we
may
study
here
some
of
the
problems
which
demand
solution
at
the
hands
of
the
american
people
our
flag
has
been
planted
in
a
land
and
we
must
face
responsibilities
which
it
would
be
cowardly
to
shirk
a
message
has
come
to
us
as
to
all
other
nations
to
do
the
bidding
and
to
spread
christianity
and
civilization
into
the
remotest
parts
of
the
earth
to
us
have
been
intrusted
duties
that
have
cost
us
the
blood
of
some
of
the
bravest
men
of
the
north
and
of
the
south
of
the
east
and
west
here
we
may
see
something
of
that
which
has
been
accomplished
as
well
as
a
presentation
of
those
conditions
which
it
is
our
duty
to
correct
it
is
our
privilege
to
give
to
others
the
same
liberty
which
we
enjoy
ourselves
to
establish
some
form
of
government
such
as
ours
whenever
these
people
are
ready
for
it
and
it
is
our
duty
to
protect
them
in
their
weakness
until
they
are
prepared
for
it
it
was
the
dream
of
our
forefathers
that
our
country
should
be
confined
between
these
two
magnificent
oceans
but
despite
these
hopes
in
later
years
additional
responsibilities
have
come
which
the
american
people
are
too
proud
to
shirk
and
too
courageous
to
abandon
there
is
no
one
who
has
seen
the
progress
which
is
here
represented
who
does
not
believe
that
the
work
for
civilization
which
is
ours
to
perform
has
already
had
such
an
impetus
that
the
time
will
come
when
we
shall
bless
those
who
had
the
courage
to
stand
for
it
against
those
who
demanded
another
solution
of
this
important
question
to
our
credit
be
it
said
that
no
true
american
demands
the
surrender
of
these
possessions
and
that
the
only
question
of
difference
between
the
people
of
our
country
is
whether
they
shall
be
given
their
independence
now
or
when
they
are
in
a
condition
to
enjoy
it
this
exposition
stands
not
only
as
a
monument
to
our
progress
but
to
our
united
and
determined
effort
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
all
that
means
the
advancement
of
mankind
and
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
world
we
owe
that
which
we
are
at
present
to
the
devotion
and
heroism
of
the
men
of
the
past
and
to
protect
and
guard
the
inheritance
which
has
come
to
us
should
be
our
aim
to
be
broad
and
conservative
in
our
conception
of
our
duties
and
responsibilities
should
be
our
purpose
to
instill
into
the
minds
of
our
youth
a
determination
to
meet
every
question
with
true
american
courage
should
be
our
object
every
effort
that
makes
for
the
good
of
humanity
is
a
fitting
tribute
to
that
national
policy
which
has
taught
us
that
there
is
no
responsibility
too
great
for
our
citizens
to
bear
and
that
in
the
onward
progress
of
civilization
america
recognizes
her
duty
and
will
not
fail
in
its
performance

remarks
i
am
very
sensible
of
the
honor
conferred
upon
me
but
will
be
unable
to
fulfill
the
duties
except
in
a
most
perfunctory
way
it
is
very
much
to
be
regretted
that
the
honorable
martin
littleton
is
not
able
to
be
with
us
as
the
official
head
of
the
government
of
the
borough
he
was
to
have
presided
on
this
occasion
in
his
absence

was

major

speech
of
major
collins
honor
francis
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
responding
as
the
representative
of
the
administration
of
the
borough
of
brooklyn
i
feel
that
you
must
realize
the
unenviable
position
i
occupy
of
appearing
on
such
brief
notice
and
of
acting
as
the
mouthpiece
of
our
president
the
hon
martin
littleton
littleton
instructs
me
to
convey
his
most
sincere
regrets
to
your
honor
to
francis
and
to
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
constituting
the
committee
of
one
hundred
on
his
enforced
absence
on
this
occasion
as
some
of
you
are
aware
there
has
been
an
election
in
this
land
previous
to
this
election
there
was
carried
on
what
some
of
us
supposed
was
a
political
campaign
this
campaign
engaged
the
interest
of
every
worthy
citizen
and
public
and
private
affairs
of
business
have
been
neglected
to
some
extent
as
a
consequence
in
the
business
of
the
borough
littleton
is
confronted
with
a
vast
accumulation
of
matters
of
greatest
importance
to
brooklyn
both
in
the
local
work
and
in
the
various
boards
and
committee
meetings
in
manhattan
and
he
has
reluctantly
concluded
that
his
absence
from
the
city
at
this
time
would
amount
to
an
almost
criminal
neglect
of
his
duty
he
asks
me
to
convey
to
you
the
congratulations
and
good
wishes
of
the
many
thousands
of
our
people
who
are
unable
to
be
with
us
brooklyn
has
had
a
deep
sympathy
with
your
fair
city
in
this
tremendous
enterprise
and
has
watched
with
keen
interest
and
satisfaction
your
success
in
overcoming
the
many
difficulties
that
lay
in
your
way
brooklyn
herself
has
awakened
from
her
sleep
of
almost
ten
years
and
the
sound
of
the
hammer
and
the
saw
and
the
ring
of
the
trowel
are
heard
on
every
hand
owing
to
the
enterprise
energy
and
efforts
of
many
of
the
men
who
are
with
us
she
is
astonishing
the
country
by
the
wonderful
increase
in
population
brooklyn
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
the
bedroom
of
manhattan
for
manhattan
is
rapidly
becoming
only
the
workshop
of
brooklyn
we
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
the
little
brother
of
manhattan
for
we
are
rapidly
becoming
a
very
big
brother
consequently
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
louis
we
feel
qualified
to
appreciate
the
satisfaction
and
joy
you
may
justly
feel
in
this
your
hour
of
triumph
and
we
extend
to
you
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
and
congratulate
you
on
this
wonderful
creation
of
yours
that
must
go
down
in
history
as
the
greatest
exposition
in
the
history
of
mankind
mayor
wells
was
unavoidably
detained
by
an
important
engagement
the
chairman
then
introduced
schieren
and
in
doing
so
said
this
is
no
fairy
story
yet
i
will
commence
it
that
way
once
upon
a
time
we
of
brooklyn
had
a
city
all
to
ourselves
we
were
proud
of
our
city
and
very
desirous
that
it
should
be
well
governed
and
were
careful
in
the
selection
of
men
to
fill
its
highest
office
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
one
of
our
most
successful
efforts
in
that
direction
was
the
choice
for
mayor
of
our
city
of
the
gentleman
whom
i
shall
now
present
to
you
charles
a
schieren
schieren
was
warmly
received
and
spoke
as
follows
address
of
schieren
in
the
name
of
the
brooklyn
delegation
i
thank
you
sincerely
for
your
cordial
greeting
and
the
hearty
welcome
extended
to
us
we
fully
appreciate
your
kind
hospitality
we
have
come
here
to
enjoy
this
glorious
exposition
which
already
has
attained
such
a
great
fame
its
magnificence
and
grandeur
both
as
to
the
magnitude
of
its
buildings
and
their
exhibits
is
a
surprise
to
every
visitor
you
may
be
proud
of
your
achievements
this
exposition
seems
to
exceed
all
others
held
in
this
country
and
in
many
respects
those
held
in
the
world
the
centennial
exposition
of
philadelphia
commemorating
the
foundation
of
our
government
gave
our
people
the
first
idea
of
the
extent
and
scope
of
our
machinery
and
the
advance
made
in
the
manufacture
of
our
american
goods
it
stimulated
the
manufacturing
interests
in
our
country
the
columbian
exposition
at
chicago
commemorated
the
discovery
of
america
it
was
noted
for
its
excellent
foreign
exhibits
it
gave
our
people
an
opportunity
to
compare
the
products
of
america
with
those
of
other
nations
the
white
city
had
a
peculiar
charm
and
made
a
deep
impression
upon
every
one
it
seemed
a
perfect
dream
ever
to
be
remembered
people
declared
that
it
could
not
be
excelled
but
hardly
a
decade
has
passed
when
the
enterprising
energetic
citizens
of
the
commercial
metropolis
of
the
great
southwest
arranged
another
fair
to
commemorate
the
historical
events
of
the
famous
louisiana
purchase
even
upon
a
larger
scale
and
overshadowing
all
others
in
this
country
we
may
exclaim
justly
will
there
ever
be
another
exposition
greater
and
more
important
than
the
one
just
about
to
close
we
seem
to
marvel
at
nothing
in
this
progressive
age
we
always
wonder
what
other
marvellous
inventions
may
be
in
store
for
us
to
necessitate
another
exposition
upon
a
gigantic
scale
to
be
held
somewhere
in
this
country
perhaps
within
another
decade
when
the
isthmian
canal
is
finished
the
golden
stream
which
will
connect
the
waters
of
the
pacific
and
atlantic
oceans
we
may
celebrate
at
the
national
capital
city
the
greatest
event
of
the
twentieth
century
bringing
to
the
commerce
of
the
world
peace
and
plenty
at
the
same
time
we
may
hope
to
celebrate
the
establishment
of
our
american
merchant
marine
the
one
thing
needed
to
carry
our
american
products
and
goods
into
the
harbors
of
the
world
floating
the
stars
and
stripes
now
so
seldom
witnessed
upon
the
ocean
vessels
this
country
seems
to
forge
ahead
at
a
rapid
pace
not
only
in
its
material
wealth
but
in
everything
that
tends
to
the
happiness
of
our
people
even
the
humblest
citizens
sharing
in
the
general
prosperity
every
section
has
cause
to
rejoice
the
south
with
its
cotton
the
north
with
its
financial
resources
the
west
with
its
farm
products
the
east
with
its
industries
all
seem
to
participate
in
the
general
welfare
of
the
country
in
conclusion
let
me
thank
you
again
for
the
courtesy
extended
to
our
people
and
we
wish
you
great
success
in
this
stupendous
enterprise
at
the
conclusion
of
schieren
remarks
the
presiding
officer
said
for
many
years
the
was
owned
and
edited
by
the
late
bernard
peters
he
was
a
man
of
strict
integrity
high
moral
ideals
and
a
forceful
writer
the
editorial
chair
of
the
is
now
occupied
by
his
son
thomas
peters
a
worthy
son
of
a
worthy
sire
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
take
pleasure
in
introducing
to
you
the
orator
of
the
day
thomas
p
peters
peters
was
greeted
with
hearty
applause
as
he
arose
his
oration
in
part
follows
oration
of
peters
to
speak
a
word
for
brooklyn
at
this
time
i
was
not
the
first
choice
of
the
committee
of
arrangements
unanimously
that
honor
was
assigned
to
one
of
brooklyn
favorite
sons
but
sickness
of
a
most
serious
nature
overtook
him
only
a
few
days
ago
and
after
a
brief
illness
he
was
early
last
wednesday
morning
called
to
his
final
rest
although
upon
pleasure
bent
our
hearts
are
sorrowful
because
of
this
loss
to
brooklyn
joseph
hendrix
had
been
prominent
in
brooklyn
life
a
quarter
of
a
century
prominent
enough
to
have
been
nominated
at
one
time
for
mayor
of
the
old
city
by
one
of
the
great
parties
he
served
brooklyn
for
many
years
as
president
of
its
board
of
education
was
its
postmaster
and
also
represented
one
of
its
districts
in
the
halls
of
congress
of
recent
years
he
had
withdrawn
from
public
life
and
devoted
himself
to
the
financial
world
there
he
soon
assumed
a
commanding
position
as
bank
president
and
his
organizing
abilities
were
constantly
in
demand
he
was
one
of
brooklyn
great
men
and
i
regret
that
he
is
not
here
to
fill
the
position
for
which
he
was
so
well
fitted
our
borough
is
rightly
in
deep
bereavement
because
of
the
taking
off
of
this
a
faithful
servant
this
party
of
brooklynites
has
come
over
miles
to
celebrate
at
this
magnificent
exposition
a
day
set
apart
for
itself
we
come
not
from
a
sovereign
state
neither
do
we
come
from
an
independent
city
we
come
from
but
part
of
a
great
city
i
will
venture
to
claim
that
brooklyn
day
at
the
louis
exposition
will
be
the
only
day
set
apart
for
any
municipal
body
holding
a
place
by
law
of
less
dignity
than
that
of
a
city
why
then
does
brooklyn
send
us
out
to
make
her
name
known
here
and
to
extend
her
greetings
to
louis
because
for
years
brooklyn
was
a
city
and
with
more
independent
citizens
to
the
total
population
than
were
to
be
found
in
any
other
part
of
the
known
world
and
she
is
still
true
to
her
history
she
had
then
a
spirit
that
was
the
very
personification
of
municipal
patriotism
she
could
tear
down
a
dishonest
political
rascal
with
greater
celerity
than
any
other
city
in
the
land
she
kept
her
two
great
parties
equally
balanced
each
a
foil
to
the
other
each
a
stimulant
to
the
other
for
good
government
and
upon
the
average
she
enjoyed
better
service
than
american
cities
usually
obtain
it
is
almost
seven
years
since
brooklyn
lost
her
cityhood
during
that
time
she
has
been
a
dependent
borough
within
the
great
city
of
new
york
many
thought
that
when
that
transition
took
place
brooklyn
would
lose
her
spirit
her
pride
would
be
humbled
and
she
would
sink
into
the
slough
of
despair
but
we
are
here
to
make
known
to
these
united
states
that
brooklyn
courage
is
as
high
her
spirit
is
as
heavily
charged
with
municipal
energy
and
her
pride
is
the
same
pride
as
of
old
brooklyn
is
a
peculiar
community
she
differs
from
all
others
the
wits
have
long
fed
upon
her
general
horace
porter
has
called
her
a
city
of
of
whom
are
alive
another
has
said
that
there
are
two
places
to
which
every
dead
new
yorker
goes
either
to
heaven
or
to
hades
and
to
brooklyn
he
may
escape
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
former
he
can
not
escape
the
latter
simeon
ford
has
declared
that
brooklyn
lies
midway
between
the
quick
and
the
dead
midway
between
reckless
extravagant
and
wicked
old
new
york
and
sober
sombre
and
serene
greenwood
mckinley
ran
for
president
upon
the
issue
of
the
full
dinner
pail
the
students
of
princeton
college
recently
asserted
that
roosevelt
was
running
upon
the
issue
of
a
full
baby
carriage
the
president
must
have
secured
his
inspiration
from
the
manner
in
which
the
cartoonists
always
pictured
the
brooklyn
man
behind
the
perambulator
we
ourselves
recognize
that
brooklyn
is
peculiar
and
unusual
her
like
is
not
known
to
the
world
that
fact
is
proved
to
an
extent
by
my
former
assertion
that
brooklyn
is
the
only
community
without
municipal
rank
that
will
have
here
a
day
of
her
own
the
fact
that
we
are
here
in
body
and
that
she
is
here
in
spirit
clearly
shows
that
the
old
courage
is
still
in
her
heart
brooklyn
may
be
only
a
borough
she
may
be
only
an
for
bridges
as
president
littlejohn
once
feared
she
would
become
but
she
is
the
same
independent
brooklyn
she
was
back
in
her
cityhood
and
she
is
as
proud
of
the
things
that
make
her
great
as
many
of
the
cities
of
the
things
that
make
them
merely
flashy
her
former
spirit
lives
it
lives
because
since
consolidation
brooklyn
has
assumed
a
commanding
place
in
the
councils
of
the
greater
city
brooklyn
has
chosen
as
her
three
borough
presidents
men
of
force
who
have
been
recognized
as
leaders
by
all
the
boroughs
at
first
the
borough
government
was
a
mockery
of
a
government
it
was
only
a
government
in
name
our
first
president
edward
grout
chafed
under
its
restraint
he
demanded
that
the
boroughs
be
allowed
a
voice
in
city
affairs
and
that
local
improvements
be
given
into
the
charge
of
borough
officials
to
him
the
state
legislature
listened
and
his
successor
in
that
office
found
himself
with
something
beside
the
shadow
of
power
and
his
administration
was
a
marvel
to
brooklyn
in
what
it
achieved
other
boroughs
looked
on
in
envy
while
edward
swanstrom
set
a
pace
so
rapid
that
its
like
will
be
difficult
to
produce
our
first
president
grout
became
the
comptroller
in
the
second
administration
of
the
greater
city
the
comptrollership
of
new
york
city
is
as
important
as
that
of
secretary
of
the
united
states
treasury
brooklyn
was
then
and
is
yet
the
dominant
force
in
the
life
of
the
metropolis
the
entire
city
recognized
grout
to
be
a
man
acquainted
with
even
the
minutest
details
of
the
city
government
brooklyn
place
at
the
table
of
the
board
of
estimate
was
a
commanding
one
with
swanstrom
and
grout
in
their
seats
and
her
representation
there
is
equally
good
grout
is
still
there
in
the
place
of
swanstrom
sits
martin
littleton
and
by
him
the
name
of
brooklyn
has
been
made
famous
from
ocean
to
ocean
and
throughout
the
entire
south
for
in
him
brooklyn
has
a
mouthpiece
that
thrills
and
through
him
she
speaks
with
a
tongue
of
eloquence
since
consolidation
brooklyn
has
been
the
second
borough
in
point
of
population
and
of
wealth
but
in
statesmanship
in
oratory
and
in
achievement
she
has
stood
and
while
many
believed
that
after
consolidation
she
would
lose
her
independent
spirit
she
has
rather
increased
her
old
pride
in
herself
and
this
pride
has
been
fostered
and
strengthened
because
of
the
worthy
sons
who
have
represented
her
in
the
government
of
the
great
city
of
new
york
two
of
whom
we
have
brought
with
us
that
louis
at
times
herself
deceived
by
those
she
trusted
may
look
upon
their
like
for
once
at
least
loyal
to
brooklyn
have
been
grout
swanstrom
and
littleton
and
thus
inspired
has
brooklyn
proved
loyal
to
herself
and
faithful
to
her
traditions
brooklyn
is
a
gigantic
borough
she
is
three
times
as
large
as
buffalo
the
home
of
the
exposition
she
is
twice
as
large
as
louis
the
home
of
the
present
exposition
brooklyn
territorially
is
large
enough
and
properly
adapted
to
hold
a
population
of
and
still
remain
less
congested
than
the
present
borough
of
manhattan
brooklyn
is
devoid
of
many
of
the
characteristics
that
mark
other
great
cities
she
is
almost
totally
lacking
in
hotel
life
a
city
of
her
population
would
have
more
hotels
but
municipal
greatness
never
rested
upon
hotel
life
it
breeds
corpulence
not
courage
it
discourages
the
rearing
of
children
a
thriving
industry
in
brooklyn
brooklyn
has
not
the
wealth
in
proportion
to
her
size
that
she
should
have
brooklyn
sat
for
long
years
under
the
shadow
of
old
new
york
contributing
to
the
wealth
of
the
metropolis
but
obtaining
nothing
in
return
her
population
contributed
to
the
real
estate
values
upon
manhattan
island
her
factories
and
forges
made
many
of
the
fortunes
that
were
spent
across
the
east
river
only
since
consolidation
have
we
received
any
dividends
upon
that
ever
increasing
investment
we
now
pay
into
the
city
treasury
and
take
out
annually
brooklyn
has
often
been
described
as
the
bedroom
of
old
new
york
the
description
was
apt
for
brooklyn
has
always
been
a
city
of
homes
a
city
of
those
of
moderate
means
a
city
of
respectability
brooklyn
has
never
been
able
to
boast
of
her
wealth
as
other
cities
nor
has
she
had
to
blush
for
her
poverty
and
depravity
as
some
other
cities
have
she
has
however
been
able
to
vaunt
herself
in
the
matter
of
those
things
which
by
nature
are
companions
of
the
home
she
has
always
been
noted
for
her
great
churches
and
has
had
the
finest
pulpit
orators
of
the
day
and
now
she
is
as
strong
in
that
direction
as
she
ever
was
in
the
past
her
private
schools
have
been
known
far
and
wide
while
so
long
as
she
controlled
her
public
schools
they
too
stood
extremely
high
since
consolidation
they
have
fallen
somewhat
behind
the
march
in
dividing
government
among
the
boroughs
grout
achieved
much
where
the
greatest
good
was
done
was
where
centralization
was
left
with
the
least
sway
in
school
matters
centralization
rules
absolutely
and
to
that
extent
the
schools
have
been
forcibly
drawn
away
from
the
people
and
the
development
has
lain
in
the
direction
of
complexity
of
educational
system
rather
than
in
that
of
perfecting
the
children
in
the
rudiments
of
scholarship
of
late
years
we
have
taught
our
boys
how
to
sew
even
if
we
did
neglect
their
spelling
this
increases
the
number
of
special
teachers
adds
to
the
city
bills
but
enables
the
school
superintendents
to
read
splendid
reports
of
new
and
special
courses
when
they
attend
pedagogic
conventions
your
exposition
loaded
new
educational
authorities
with
medals
and
prizes
and
honorable
mentions
i
would
not
censure
you
for
this
no
men
ever
worked
harder
for
such
honors
the
trouble
is
they
work
too
hard
over
frills
and
neglect
the
essentials
were
your
judges
to
hold
an
examination
among
our
grammar
scholars
upon
the
three
subjects
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
you
would
send
hurry
orders
for
the
return
of
many
of
those
prizes
in
school
matters
brooklyn
is
at
a
loss
no
further
than
are
the
other
boroughs
of
the
greater
city
she
is
at
a
loss
because
advice
was
not
taken
in
short
we
so
highly
prize
our
sewers
our
streets
and
our
pavements
that
we
directed
that
they
be
given
directly
into
our
own
charge
and
under
our
own
borough
president
and
then
we
held
our
children
in
such
light
esteem
that
we
surrendered
them
into
the
keeping
of
a
centralized
board
of
education
which
is
in
turn
in
the
keeping
of
the
board
of
superintendents
in
which
body
brooklyn
has
but
a
small
voice
it
has
reminded
me
of
those
people
who
personally
care
for
their
own
dogs
and
horses
and
leave
their
children
to
servants
and
hired
tutors
the
system
has
been
wrong
the
wrong
system
has
been
made
the
results
have
been
poor
brooklyn
has
developed
the
home
life
of
america
to
a
greater
extent
than
any
other
city
has
done
she
has
few
palaces
she
has
few
hovels
she
has
a
great
army
of
american
mothers
and
fathers
that
are
bringing
up
the
next
generation
of
men
and
women
and
she
is
rearing
them
in
thousands
of
comfortable
homes
where
body
develops
with
mind
and
where
the
spiritual
welfare
is
an
important
factor
brooklyn
has
a
park
system
of
which
she
is
proud
and
of
which
she
will
grow
prouder
in
prospect
park
she
has
a
jewel
in
the
very
heart
of
the
community
in
forest
park
she
has
a
promise
of
great
future
development
that
new
park
lies
upon
high
ground
overlooking
a
vast
section
of
the
borough
and
exhibiting
to
the
eye
the
bay
of
jamaica
and
the
ocean
beyond
forest
park
is
richly
endowed
by
nature
and
it
will
in
the
days
to
come
be
in
beauty
above
either
prospect
or
central
brooklyn
has
great
driveways
leading
to
the
ocean
along
her
harbor
front
and
out
into
long
island
and
she
has
laid
out
many
small
parks
and
is
still
engaged
upon
that
work
in
library
matters
brooklyn
is
well
supplied
the
system
is
most
extensive
and
has
been
rapidly
developed
it
is
another
indication
of
what
can
be
done
when
a
department
is
decentralized
the
brooklyn
public
library
is
under
the
control
of
brooklyn
men
the
board
of
estimate
makes
it
an
annual
allowance
andrew
carnegie
gave
to
brooklyn
for
library
construction
with
that
money
twenty
branch
libraries
are
to
be
erected
in
time
five
are
up
one
is
in
operation
there
are
over
twenty
branch
libraries
most
of
them
are
in
rented
quarters
and
they
circulate
over
one
million
books
a
year
among
the
people
as
another
indication
of
the
life
of
brooklyn
brief
reference
should
be
made
to
the
institute
of
arts
and
sciences
the
great
college
of
those
beyond
school
years
it
has
been
referred
to
as
the
intellectual
bargain
counter
of
brooklyn
it
offers
at
very
moderate
prices
literary
historical
musical
instruction
and
entertainment
and
lectures
in
all
the
sciences
it
is
well
supported
and
the
city
is
building
it
a
central
building
that
will
be
the
mecca
of
the
ambitious
and
the
cultured
no
other
city
in
the
land
supports
such
an
institution
and
it
is
a
great
credit
to
us
brooklyn
spirit
is
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
nature
of
the
press
that
caters
to
her
her
newspapers
are
intensely
local
in
character
they
give
to
her
institutions
such
support
as
is
not
given
to
the
institutions
of
any
other
city
in
the
united
states
it
is
this
that
has
encouraged
an
intelligent
and
independent
breadth
of
mind
in
brooklyn
she
keeps
alive
the
old
new
england
custom
of
a
close
watch
over
her
government
and
of
a
constant
discussion
of
all
public
questions
englishmen
are
noted
for
their
unremitting
guard
of
their
personal
rights
they
are
not
to
be
compared
in
this
with
brooklynites
who
in
spite
of
a
callous
railroad
system
still
persist
in
demanding
their
rights
her
press
has
called
into
being
all
over
brooklyn
numerous
boards
of
trade
and
taxpayers
associations
and
they
encouraged
by
the
attention
given
to
them
devote
themselves
to
their
neighborhoods
edmund
burke
referred
to
the
journalists
as
a
fourth
estate
aptly
might
we
regard
these
trade
boards
as
a
second
government
highly
are
they
respected
many
reforms
especially
in
transportation
matters
have
they
achieved
i
have
outlined
to
you
some
of
the
features
of
brooklyn
life
she
is
in
truth
the
place
where
the
home
life
of
greater
new
york
is
developed
where
it
may
be
seen
in
its
simple
beauty
adorned
with
its
rugged
virtue
i
have
not
boasted
of
her
rich
men
but
of
her
intellectual
gifts
not
of
her
social
leaders
but
of
her
men
and
women
not
of
her
wealth
but
of
her
mental
attainments
it
is
from
such
a
community
that
we
come
to
write
upon
your
visitors
book
the
name
of
brooklyn
in
our
way
we
are
as
proud
of
our
homes
as
was
the
old
roman
matron
of
her
two
sons
although
we
may
be
as
poorly
decked
with
tawdry
jewels
as
she
was
we
are
as
proud
of
our
independence
in
politics
as
philadelphia
should
be
ashamed
of
her
regularity
boston
is
credited
with
being
the
athens
of
america
brooklyn
deserves
the
title
but
would
leave
to
boston
her
pedantic
ways
we
are
sincere
in
our
speech
and
simple
in
our
faith
and
when
we
say
we
rejoice
in
success
are
glad
to
be
here
and
are
honored
in
having
a
day
set
aside
for
us
we
but
echo
the
sentiments
that
our
hearts
suggest
at
the
conclusion
of

remarks
by

we

be
thankful
way
down
deep
in
our
hearts
that
we
are
citizens
of
such
a
great
country
the
united
states
of
america
when
you
think
of
its
wonderful
struggle
for
years
and
know
that
it
is
at
the
forefront
of
progress
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
should
we
not
be
thankful
that
we
are
a
part
of

we
should
be
thankful
that
we
have
such
a
great
president
a
man
respected
by
all
nations
republicans
should
be
thankful
that
they
won
such
a
great
victory
at
the
polls
and
democrats
should
be
thankful
that
the
republicans
give
them
such
good
government
the
married
men
here
should
be
thankful
that
they
have
such
good
wives
and
the
wives
that
they
have
such
good
husbands
the
unmarried
men
that
they
have
in
the
future
such
a
vista
of
happiness
that
is
to
come
to
them
and
the
young
ladies
should
be
thankful
that
there
are
so
many
young
men
around
there
is
no
way
to
view
this
occasion
but
with
a
thanksgiving
spirit
and
nothing
pleases
me
more
than
to
be
with
you
there
has
been
no
feature
of
our
fair
at
any
time
in
all
of
its
various
functions
we
have
had
that
gives
me
such
great
pleasure
as
to
preside
at
this
gathering
it
is
the
first
time
we
have
been
all
brought
together
and
while
the
hours
of
the
fair

numbered
i
am
sure
that
every
one
will
go
home
never
forgetting
the
pleasant
days
they
have
had
at

at

said
that
it

expressed
the
hope

a
perfect

tangible
results
might
be
shown

also
humorously
referred

threatened
the
destruction
of
the
state
building

thought

him

in

unknown
until
we
met
we
sailed
awhile
together

no

this
composite

from

breathed
a
peaceful
spirit
and
the
hours
have
sped
on

from
early
dawn
till
late
is
something
to
have
met
each
other
here
and
found
in
each
some
trait
to
be
admired

felt
the
world
replete
with
joy
and
cheer
and
friendship
still
the
thing
to
be
desired
the
tiny
corners
that
we
once
possessed
by
gentle
contact
have
been
rubbed
away
and
words
that
might
have
hurt
have
been
suppressed
and
peacefully
we
hail
this
festive
day
the
time
when
we
must
part
comes
on
apace
and
soon
we
wend
along
our
various
ways

be
for

welcome
friends
of
exposition
days
to
name
each
one
and
strive
to
pay
the
debt
we
owe
of
deepest
gratitude
and
praise
in
words
would
take
me
many
hours
yet
and
possibly
run
over
into
days
and
after
all
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
only
means
we
met
to
live
to
part
then
here
my
wish
that
we
have
just
begun
a

which
may
blossom

offices
were
immediately
opened
at

and
the
work
of
collecting
and
preparing
the
exhibit
material
was
begun
as
the
schools
were
just
about
to
close
for
the
summer
holidays
but
little
could
be
accomplished
and
none
of
the
work

could

it
is
to
be
regretted
that
time
was
not
allowed
to
procure
an
exhibit
of
work
covering
an
entire
school
year
that
which
covers
a
shorter

of
necessity
fragmentary

assist
the

necessary
expenses
while

for

it
would
be
hard
to
overestimate
the
services
performed
by
this

each
member
took
a
hearty
interest
in
the
work
in
hand
and
freely
gave
of
his
time
and
advice
in
carrying
the
work
forward
to
a
successful
conclusion
any
lack
of
interest
or
enthusiasm
on
the
part
of
the
members
of
a
given
association
was
quickly
dispelled
by
a
personal
appeal
to
its
members
from
its
representative
upon
the
committee
in
this
way
the
interest
was
most
genuine
and
general
throughout
the
state
and
in
no
way
could
the
sentiment
of
educational
interests
be
more
clearly
crystallized
than
in
a
meeting
of
this
committee
and
to
them
is
due
the
thanks
of
the
commission
as
well
as
the
thanks
of
the
educational
forces
of
the
state
of

for
their

prepare

always
looked
upon
as
standing
in

authorities
announced
that
no

smaller
than

would
be
recognized
except
in
the
case
of
four

named
as

in

of
the

by

the
city
authorities
early
expressed
a
willingness
and
desire
to
with
the
state
authorities
in
the
preparation
of
an
exhibit
and
agreed
to
follow
the
same
general
style
of
installation
and
arrangement
due
acknowledgment
is
hereby
made
to
superintendent
maxwell
associate

edson
and
to
committees
in
charge
of
minor
details
for
the
adoption
of
plans
already
inaugurated
in
the
preparation
of

exhibit
and
to

superintendent
of

buildings
in
the
city
of

who
prepared
the
plans
for
the
booth
for
both
the
state
and
city
exhibits
at
no
expense
to
the
state
the
installation
the
booth
was
so
planned
that
from
the
outside
it
was
apparently
a
single
inclosure
the
state
and
city
exhibits
being
separated
on
the
interior
by
an
appropriate
screen
nine
feet
high
through
which
an
entranceway
was
cut
snyder
plans
provided
for
a
scheme
of
installation
which
while
inexpensive
was
both
artistic
and
dignified
and
admirably
adapted
for
the
display
of
the
material
to
be
exhibited
in
fact
it
was
generally
conceded
that
much
more
effective
results
had
been
obtained
than
by
surrounding
states
which
had
expended
considerably
more
money
the
inclosure
was
massive
the
woodwork
being
an
effective
imitation
of
flemish
oak
and
the
hanging
surface
a
burlap
of
a
neutral
green
tint
the
facade
sixteen
feet
in
height
being
broken
every
few
feet
at
fixed
intervals
by
fluted
pilasters
with
ornamental
caps
on
the
outside
a
wainscoting
extended
three
feet
from
the
floor
above
which
were
panels
for
hanging
exhibit
material
the
whole
being
capped
by
an
attractive
dentulated
cornice
the
entranceway
which
was
thrown
across
the
corner
at
the
intersection
of
the
aisles
was
a
massive
arch
surmounted
by
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
state
tinted
in
old
ivory
underneath
which
in
gold
letters
was
state
of
new
york
the
interior
was
cut
by
transverse
walls
nine
feet
high
and
extending
seven
feet
from
the
main
wall
thus
forming
a
series
of
alcoves
convenient
for
study
on
the
part
of
visitors
and
leaving
in
the
center
an
open
space
for
the
display
of
models
apparatus
and
cabinet
material
directly
facing
the
entranceway
were
general
and
private
offices
completely
surrounding
the
interior
of
the
booth
on
the
eye
line
were
wall
cabinets
which
have
come
to
be
so
generally
used
for
the
display
of
exhibit
material
the
wall
space
above
the
cabinets
was
used
for
the
display
of
especially
meritorious
and
attractive
material
while
below
was
a
countershelf
upon
which
here
and
there
rested
a
showcase
for
the
display
of
sewing
clay
modeling
botanical
specimens
etc
underneath
the
counters
were
shelves
for
bound
books
and
cupboards
for
the
storage
of
printed
matter
and
supplies
all
work
was
mounted
uniformly
upon
a
scotch
gray
cardboard
and
neatly
lettered
in
white
ink
scope
of
the
exhibit
instead
of
confining
the
exhibit
to
the
work
of
the
public
schools
as
was
quite
generally
done
by
other
states
exhibiting
it
was
decided
to
show
so
far
as
possible
work
now
being
done
in
all
forms
and
phases
of
education
in
the
empire
state
space
was
freely
given
to
private
institutions
to
demonstrate
the
place
which
they
are
filling
in
the
educational
work
of
the
state
every
subdivision
of
the
official
classification
found
an
exemplification
within
the
new
york
state
exhibit
the
participation
of
cities
and
numerous
incorporated
villages
both
in
elementary
and
high
school
work
made
the
exhibits
of
those
departments
thoroughly
representative
of
the
work
of
the
state
as
a
whole
it
is
unfair
to
pick
the
work
of
a
few
progressive
school
systems
and
endeavor
to
make
it
stand
for
the
work
of
the
state
at
large
plan
of
arrangement
the
plan
of
arrangement
was
arrived
at
only
after
the
most
careful
thought
and
discussion
the
desire
being
to
so
arrange
the
material
as
to
be
most
serviceable
to
the
educator
and
to
those
seeking
suggestions
and
helpful
ideas
in
arranging
an
educational
exhibit
emphasis
must
be
placed
either
upon
political
divisions
subjects
or
grades
it
was
early
determined
that
no
separate
space
should
be
assigned
to
any
single
locality
but
that
all
of
the
work
of
the
state
in
the
grades
should
be
exhibited
grade
by
grade
and
that
of
the
high
schools
by
subjects
and
arranged
under
various
departments
such
as
science
classics
mathematics
thus
making
it
possible
for
a
grade
teacher
to
readily
compare
her
work
with
that
of
new
york
and
to
profit
by
the
comparison
no
matter
in
whose
favor
it
might
be
and
a
high
school
instructor
in
charge
of
a
department
to
readily
find
the
work
of
that
department
this
method
rendered
it
unnecessary
to
look
over
the
exhibits
from
several
cities
to
find
the
particular
work
desired
moreover
a
further
subdivision
was
made
in
that
the
work
was
arranged
according
to
the
population
of
the
contributing
cities
and
villages
that
is
the
work
from
the
city
of
the
largest
population
contributing
was
installed
first
and
so
on
in
order
while
it
was
not
the
purpose
to
invite
comparison
of
work
between
rival
cities
of
the
state
but
rather
to
present
a
united
front
to
the
world
at
large
still
if
it
was
the
desire
of
some
to
make
such
comparison
the
above
indicated
arrangement
was
the
most
equitable
as
all
cities
of
approximately
the
same
resources
and
theoretically
working
under
like
conditions
were
placed
side
by
side
and
the
work
of
the
small
village
was
not
placed
in
juxtaposition
with
that
of
the
large
strongly
centralized
city
system
with
many
times
its
resources
a
complete
catalogue
of
the
exhibit
was
freely
distributed
and
made
to
work
of
the
various
localities
so
there
was
no
difficulty
for
those
interested
in
a
single
place
to
locate
the
work
it
contributed
it
was
generally
conceded
that
while
the
above
arrangement
made
no
concession
to
local
pride
it
was
by
all
odds
the
wisest
arrangement
to
follow
in
an
exposition
of
international
scope
the
compliments
which
were
bestowed
upon
the
arrangement
of
the
exhibit
and
the
readiness
with
which
all
visitors
found
the
work
in
which
they
were
particularly
interested
demonstrated
beyond
a
doubt
the
wisdom
of
the
committee
in
pursuing
the
course
above
outlined
the
entire
exhibit
was
also
carefully
classified
in
harmony
with
the
official
classification
of
the
exposition
under
the
several
groups
and
subdivisions
thereof
thereby
rendering
additional
aid
in
promptly
locating
exhibits
in
any
particular
department
exhibit
divisions
entering
the
booth
one
found
to
the
left
of
the
entrance
the
exhibit
of
the
former
state
department
of
public
instruction
it
should
be
stated
here
that
the
exhibits
of
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
of
the
state
department
of
public
instruction
were
prepared
before
unification
was
an
accomplished
fact
the
two
exhibits
can
be
said
to
have
formed
the
exhibit
of
the
new
department
of
education
next
was
the
exhibit
of
the
kindergartens
filling
three
units
the
term
unit
is
used
to
designate
one
of
the
wall
cabinets
containing
cards
x
inches
adjoining
the
kindergarten
section
was
the
exhibit
of
the
elementary
grades
filling
units
all
the
subjects
of
the
curriculum
were
shown
the
work
in
the
wall
cabinets
being
types
or
samples
of
work
the
great
bulk
of
which
was
shown
in
bound
volumes
was
made
on
the
margin
of
each
card
to
the
volume
containing
similar
work
thus
facilitating
the
search
of
the
visitor
for
a
number
of
class
exercises
of
work
of
the
same
general
nature
and
relieving
the
visitor
interested
in
a
general
way
of
looking
over
a
vast
repetition
of
material
separating
the
elementary
grades
from
the
high
schools
was
the
exhibit
of
the
rural
schools
of
the
state
those
schools
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
several
school
commissioners
it
was
most
complete
and
interesting
and
afforded
a
clear
picture
of
the
work
done
in
the
ungraded
country
schools
the
exhibit
of
the
high
schools
filling
fourteen
units
was
next
in
order
and
as
stated
above
was
subdivided
into
subjects
cities
of
the
state
to
say
nothing
of
the
incorporated
villages
private
institutions
contributed
material
in
one
or
more
of
the
foregoing
departments
next
was
installed
the
exhibit
covering
the
professional
training
of
teachers
equally
divided
between
the
state
normal
school
system
and
the
work
of
the
training
schools
and
classes
in
cities
and
villages
each
occupying
five
units
every
normal
school
of
the
state
was
represented
each
making
a
special
exhibit
in
the
particular
subject
or
subjects
assigned
it
by
a
committee
of
normal
school
principals
to
whom
was
delegated
the
duty
of
preparing
an
exhibit
all
of
the
city
training
schools
in
the
state
save
four
were
represented
as
well
as
the
great
majority
of
training
classes
the
whole
exhibit
having
been
arranged
by
the
state
supervisor
of
training
schools
and
classes
in
the
next
section
was
installed
the
exhibit
in
higher
education
exhibits
being
in
place
from
colgate
university
hobart
college
manhattan
college
the
college
of
pharmacy
allied
with
columbia
university
and
syracuse
university
the
latter
institution
making
an
exhibit
both
in
applied
sciences
and
in
fine
arts
next
were
installed
the
exhibits
of
technical
and
trade
schools
which
contained
interesting
displays
from
the
leading
institutions
in
the
state
engaged
in
this
line
of
work
just
beyond
was
the
exhibit
of
the
industrial
schools
and
then
the
display
of
special
work
in
education
which
is
being
done
by
institutions
not
wholly
educational
in
character
a
unique
unit
was
that
devoted
to
the
work
of
the
indian
schools
of
the
state
each
of
the
several
reservations
being
represented
and
the
whole
exhibit
being
arranged
by
the
state
inspector
of
indian
schools
the
next
alcove
was
devoted
to
the
education
of
defectives
it
contained
concise
exhibits
from
the
institutions
of
the
state
devoted
to
the
instruction
of
the
deaf
dumb
and
blind
and
was
carefully
studied
by
those
engaged
in
this
work
the
exhibit
of
summer
schools
and
extension
courses
adjoined
this
and
was
designed
to
show
the
work
which
is
best
exemplified
by
the
chautauqua
institution
in
a
manner
allied
with
this
work
is
that
of
the
education
department
in
visual
instruction
which
is
carried
on
by
lantern
slides
to
aid
in
the
teaching
of
geography
history
and
kindred
subjects
it
was
therefore
installed
under
this
head
the
exhibit
received
hearty
commendation
from
educators
generally
but
particularly
from
foreign
visitors
the
scheme
is
thoroughly
practicable
and
nowhere
else
is
it
carried
on
with
the
same
careful
attention
to
detail
nor
is
the
same
perfection
of
slide
making
reached
as
in
the
state
of
new
york
the
last
exhibit
before
leaving
the
booth
was
that
of
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
special
features
there
were
many
features
of
special
interest
a
series
of
charts
were
prepared
as
the
special
exhibit
of
the
new
york
state
teachers
association
and
will
be
reproduced
in
the
forthcoming
report
of
that
body
to
one
interested
in
following
the
tremendous
progress
made
in
every
branch
of
educational
activity
within
our
state
during
the
past
decade
these
charts
are
invaluable
the
two
charts
here
reproduced
and
which
formed
a
part
of
the
exhibit
of
the
department
of
public
instruction
were
the
subject
of
much
comment
the
model
of
the
new
state
normal
and
training
school
at
fredonia
which
was
prepared
by
the
manual
training
and
art
classes
of
the
institution
came
in
for
its
share
of
attention
it
was
an
accurate
model
of
one
of
the
state
finest
educational
structures
the
state
normal
school
at
new
paltz
sent
a
doll
house
made
by
the
seventh
grade
boys
for
the
first
grade
children
in
the
practice
department
the
entire
structure
being
completely
furnished
and
appointed
by
the
children
a
special
feature
was
the
exhibit
of
clay
modeling
from
the
state
school
of
clay
working
and
ceramics
at
alfred
the
only
school
of
its
kind
in
the
united
states
receiving
state
aid
near
by
stood
a
cabinet
full
of
apparatus
sent
from
various
institutions
but
a
large
part
of
which
came
from
the
physical
laboratories
of
pratt
institute
brooklyn
the
exhibit
contained
much
of
interest
to
a
science
teacher
on
the
exterior
of
the
facade
was
a
huge
educational
map
of
the
state
upon
which
was
shown
the
location
grade
construction
and
normal
capacity
of
every
institution
of
learning
within
its
borders
the
superiority
of
new
york
schoolhouses
was
shown
by
the
large
number
constructed
of
brick
and
stone
the
year
marked
the
passing
of
the
log
schoolhouse
only
four
of
which
were
shown
upon
the
map
as
against
approximately
fifty
ten
years
ago
the
facade
also
contained
an
admirable
exhibit
of
art
work
prepared
by
the
students
of
the
new

school
of
applied

the
work
of
one
of
the
most
complete
systems
of

kindergartens
in
the
country
as
well
as
the
correlation
of

in
the
elementary

also
manual
training

courses
in
the

batavia
demonstrated
the
system
of
individual
instruction
as
carried
on
in
its
schools
which
involves
the
employment
of
two
teachers
in
each
classroom
syracuse
exemplified
its

manual
training
and
physical
training
in
the
elementary

jamestown
clearly
set
forth
its
course
in
manual
training
throughout
the
entire
school
course
while
ithaca
in
addition
to
a
exhibit
by
means
of
photographs
brought
out
the
subject
of
high
school
athletics
the
exhibit
from
yonkers
which
was
general
in
character
portrayed
the
efficiency
and
superiority
of
the
school
equipment
in
that
city
editorial
comment
the
exhibit
from
first
to
last
demonstrated
beyond
peradventure
the
beneficial
results
accruing
from
a
strongly
centralized
and
at
the
same
time
most
liberal
administration
of
educational
interests
a
prominent
morning
daily
paper
commenting
editorially
upon
the
exhibit
says
it
is
worth
your
attention
it
means
more
to
every
citizen
of
the
empire
state
than
any
other
exhibit
shown
the
chief
product
of
the
empire
state
is
men
neither
fields
of
grain
or
manufactures
invention
or
art
are
as
important
a
product
as
men
in
new
york
state
are
produced
some
of
the
greatest
men
of
the
country
a
large
part
of
the
raw
material
comes
into
new
york
harbor
past
enlightening
the
world
and
is
gradually
converted
into
citizenship
some
of
the
raw
material
imported
is
next
to
worthless
some
of
the
domestic
stuff
is
equally
unpromising
but
in
the
great
bulk
year
in
and
year
out
there
is
the
making
of
fine
men
new
york
state
men
are
scattered
throughout
the
country
they
found
the
cities
of
the
west
they
run
the
railroads
they
manipulate
the
finances
they
capitalize
the
new
enterprises
they
invest
in
the
futures
they
get
into
the
public
offices
they
plan
the
political
campaigns
they
produce
the
new
ideas
they
center
current
history
men
are
made
in
new
york
state
in
the
schools
the
better
the
schools
the
finer
the
quality
of
the
men
produced
therefore
the
school
exhibit
of
new
york
state
should
interest
every
citizen
as
the
schools
have
been
bettering
year
by
year
and
the
product
increasing
in
value
the
commission
in
charge
of
this
exhibit
has
spared
no
expense
to
make
this
educational
showing
a
storehouse
of
novel
ideas
and
suggestions
dealing
with
the
advance
in
pedagogy
and
of
the
state
resources
in
the
teaching
of
the
young

disposition
of
material
many
requests
were
received
from
the
representatives
of
foreign
governments
agents
of
pedagogical
museums
and
individuals
for
portions
of
the
exhibit
but
the
determination
of
the
lewis
and
clark
exposition
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
send
the
entire
exhibit
to
the

precluded
the
possibility
of
acceding
to
these
requests
and
insures
the
holding
intact
of
the
entire
exhibit
throughout
the
portland
exposition
period
at
the
conclusion
of
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
provision
will
be
made
for
the
establishment
of
a

probably
more
than

however
for

be

to
with

in

frequent

sections
of

country
met
and
acted
during
the
last
two
weeks
of
march
in
the
city
of
new
york
passing
upon
upwards
of
works
submitted
for
exhibition
of
this
assemblage
of
works
a
comparatively
small
number
represented
artists
of
high
reputation
and
a
small
proportion
was
found
to
be
of
sufficient
merit
worthily
to
represent
the
artists
of
the
state
the
number
of
exhibits
secured
thus
being
very
small
and
many
of
the
more
prominent
artists
not
having
submitted
works
the
different
group
juries
held
meetings
prepared
lists
of
representative
works
calculated
to
reflect
credit
upon
the
state
and
specifically
invited
artists
and
owners
to
lend
the
same
for
the
exposition
by
this
means
the
larger
and
better
portion
of
the
exhibit
was
secured
the
state
of

york
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
and
the
artists
in
general
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
under
great
obligations
to
the
members
of
these
juries
who
so
freely
unselfishly
and
devotedly
gave
their
valuable
time
and
effort
to
the
organization
of
the
art
exhibit
which
represented
so
comprehensively
the
best
achievement
of
new
york
artists
a
representative
exhibit
almost
every
new
york
painter
of
individuality
and
ability
in
oil
and
miniature
work
was
represented
adequately
and
creditably
the
exhibit
of
sculpture
was
exceptionally
fine
etching
and
engraving
were
exemplified
by
the
ablest
exponents
of
these
branches
of
art
wood
engraving
by
types
of
its
highest
expression
there
was
an
excellent
collection
of
works
from
the
leading
american
illustrators
and
noteworthy
examples
of
the
applied
arts
of
artistic
handicrafts
by
new
york
art
workers
were
well
in
evidence
in
architecture
while
the
exhibit
was
creditable
it
might
have
been
more
comprehensive
and
representative
and
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
exhibit
of
mural
painting
the
latter
however
as
readily
may
be
understood
is
extremely
difficult
of
representation
at
an
exposition
most
of
its
examples
having
been
executed
in
place
and
only
cartoons
or
photographs
of
achieved
works

exhibit
by

superintendent
illustration
the
new
york
state
commission
in
july
appointed
durkee
of
sandy
hill
superintendent
of
agriculture
live
stock
and
dairy
products
with
john
mccann
of
elmira
howard
moon
of
cobleskill
theodore
horton
of
elmira
and
smith
as
assistants
in
the
department
of
agriculture
smallwood
of
warsaw
and
mccoduck
of
sandy
hill
having
direct
supervision
of
live
stock
and
dairy
products
respectively
george
smith
of
geneva
was
superintendent
for
collecting
dairy
products
these
gentlemen
did
the
work
assigned
them
faithfully
and
well
which
is
fully
attested
by
the
number
of
grand
prizes
and
medals
won
in
these
departments
scope
of
exhibit
new
york
state
has
no
distinctive
agricultural
product
as
has
many
of
the
other
especially
some
of
the
western
states
but
grows
nearly
everything
in
larger
or
smaller
quantities
that
is
grown
in
the
north
temperate
zone
in
collecting
and
installing
this
exhibit
the
aim
was
to
gather
these
varied
products
and
arrange
them
so
as
to
show
the
real
grain
or
vegetable
to
the
best
advantage
rather
than
to
show
a
fancifully
arranged
display
of
such
products
as
would
be
of
little
or
no
value
to
those
interested
in
practical
agriculture
with
this
end
in
view
each
section
of
the
state
was
drawn
upon
for
the
best
samples
of
the
staple
crops
of
that
section
these
samples
were
carefully
inspected
by
competent
judges
and
only
those
of
real
merit
were
placed
in
the
collection
for
exhibit
so
thoroughly
was
this
work
of
selection
done
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
samples
received
an
award
labeling
each
specimen
that
the
exhibit
might
be
of
the
greatest
value
to
those
most
interested
in
agricultural
pursuits
on
each
sample
was
placed
a
card
giving
the
name
and
variety
of
the
sample
also
the
name
and
post
office
address
of
the
grower
every
day
men
could
be
seen
with
pencil
and
paper
in
hand
taking
names
and
addresses
for
future
correspondence
continuous
display
of
vegetables
new
york
was
one
of
the
few
states
that
had
its
exhibit
complete
at
the
opening
of
the
exposition
and
was
the
only
state
that
made
a
large
and
continuous
display
of
fresh
vegetables
its
display
was
greatly
admired
and
favorably
commented
upon
by
the
press
as
well
as
by
individuals
from
the
opening
of
the
exposition
until
the
crop
of
was
ready
the
tables
of
the
new
york
exhibit
were
kept
filled
with
the
standard
vegetables
of
which
had
been
placed
in
cold
storage
and
were
brought
out
as
needed
at
the
close
of
the
exposition
december
new
york
had
over
forty
varieties
of
potatoes
as
well
as
many
other
vegetables
on
exhibition
that
were
gathered
in
having
been
out
of
the
ground
over
fifteen
months
to
the
inexperienced
eye
they
could
not
be
distinguished
from
the
crop
of
in
october
and
november
new
vegetable
display
was
unusually
fine
the
judges
who
passed
upon
it
said
it
was
the
finest
collection
of
vegetables
they
had
ever
seen
awards
the
catalogue
of
exhibitors
which
follows
shows
conclusively
that
new
york
is
truly
the
empire
state
so
far
as
agricultural
products
are
concerned
it
was
the
only
state
that
was
awarded
a
grand
prize
on
fresh
vegetables
alone

commission
of
the

charles

of
rochester
was
appointed
as

of
horticulture
and
an
appropriation
of

made
for
the
exhibit
in

this

rochester
methods
of
soliciting
fruit
many
hundred
letters
were
mailed
to
the
fruit
growers
of
the
state
soliciting
the
donation
of
fruit
for
an
exhibit
at
louis
the
number
of
replies
received
was
so
small
that
it
was
necessary
again
to
circularize
the
growers
offering
to
pay
a
reasonable
price
for
exhibition
fruit
even
this
offer
did
not
bring
forth
anything
like
a
sufficient
quantity
of
fruit
to
make
a
suitable
exhibit
the
state
was
then
divided
into
six
sections
and
competent
men
appointed
to
canvass
thoroughly
each
section
and
buy
fruit
a
large
collection
of
fine
specimens
of
fruit
were
procured
by
this
method
and
as
a
result
of
this
canvass
exhibits
were
procured
from
every
fruit
growing
county
in
the
state
this
fruit
was
all
collected
at
the
gleason
cold
storage
warehouse
at
brighton
near
rochester
and
on
december
a
shipment
of
two
cars
containing
four
hundred
barrels
of
apples
bushel
boxes
of
pears
and
forty
baskets
of
grapes
were
forwarded
to
the
mound
city
cold

at
louis
location
of

the
exhibit
was
housed
in
the
palace
of
horticulture
which
although
located
in
a
somewhat
remote
part
of
the
grounds

were
deeply
interested
in
the
magnificent
displays
of

found
there
the

was
assigned
square

advantageously
located
near
the

of
the

to
accommodate
the
large
exhibit
of
grapes
from
the
central
new

growers
and
from
the
chautauqua
grape
and
wine
association
the
installation
the
space
included
three
distinct
sections
nos
and
completely
surrounded
by
aisles
thus
affording
an
excellent
opportunity
of
viewing
the
exhibit
from
all
sides
on
account
of
this
an
open
installation
was
erected
around
section
was
thrown
an
open
facade
consisting
of
columns
supporting
a
handsome
cornice
which
bore
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
state
and
the
words
the
state
of
new
york
on
each
side
on
the
cornice
rested
fifteen
fine
specimens
of
boston
ferns
the
fruit
was
displayed
upon
tables
of
varying
lengths
and
from
three
to
four
feet
in
width
in
the
center
of
this
space
was
the
office
of
the
superintendent
sections
and
were
within
the
zone
in
which
low
installation
was
required
by
the
exposition
authorities
so
that
no
facade
was
erected
in
these
sections
the
name
of
the
state
being
shown
upon
handsome
ornamental
gilt
signs
placed
upon
the
tables
and
suspended
over
the
exhibit
the
entire
installation
was
of
white
enamel
kept
spotlessly
clean
the
plates
used
were
of
special
design
the
center
was
white
with
the
monogram
in
green
letters
and
a
wide
green
border
with
a
gold
band
the
white
and
green
furnished
a
most
appropriate
background
for
the
varicolored
fruit
and
the
effect
was
most
pleasing
as
the
eye
swept
over
the
whole
exhibit
a
word
of
commendation
on
the
opening

of

new

was
the
only
state
to
have
its
exhibit
installed
and
ready
for
exhibition
when
the
doors
of
the
palace
of
horticulture
were
thrown
open
to
the
public
which
called
forth
a
special
word
of
commendation
from
the
chief
of
the
department
of
horticulture
honorable
taylor
owing
to
the
fact
that
at
that
time
the
other
states
were
not
prepared
to
make
a
display
it
was
deemed
inadvisable
to
exhibit
a
large
number
of
varieties
so
that
while
the
entire
space
was
covered
with
fruit
the
exhibit
consisted
of

was
as

record
of

as
all

twice
once
for
the
general

and
again
for

the

free
from

was
somewhat
smaller
in

than
the

it
made
a
grand
display
and
from
the
opening
to
the

from
to

never

by
the
thousands
of

apples
the
apples
placed
in
cold
storage
at
louis
in
december
of
were
found
to
be
in
almost
perfect
condition
when
opened
in
april
and
with
a
few
exceptions
continued
so
throughout
the
season
most
of
the
apples
were
wrapped
first
in
tissue
and
then
in
oiled
paper
and
firmly
packed
in
barrels
well
lined
with
corrugated
paper
with
excelsior
cushions
in
each
end
owing
to
the
fact
that
so
much
depends
upon
the
condition
of
fruit
when
picked
and
the
necessity
of
placing
it
in
cold
storage
as
soon
as
picked
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
make
a
comparative
test
of
the
keeping
qualities
of
the
different
varieties
for
instance
of
two
different
collections
of
baldwins
one
of
the
best
keepers
placed
on
the
tables
at
the
same
time
one
lot
held
up
in
perfect
condition
for
several
weeks
while
the
other
went
down
in
as
many
days
the
varieties
showing
the
best
keeping
qualities
were
baldwin
spitzenberg
russet
northern
spy
and
canada
red
these
varieties
were
kept
in
cold
storage
and
placed
on
the
tables
as
late
in
the
season
as
november
fifteenth
when
they
were
found
to
have
retained
their
color
firmness
and
flavor
some
of
the
fall
varieties
which
are
ordinarily
supposed
to
be
poor
keepers
came
out
of
cold
storage
in
perfect
condition
and
kept
remarkably
well
after
being
placed
on
the
tables
among
these
the
alexander

were
the
best
a
collection

were
placed
on
the
tables
april
when
they
attracted
considerable
attention
on
account
of
their
unusual
size
and
fine
color
and
remained
in
splendid
condition
for
weeks
while
somewhat
shriveled
and
dried
up
they
showed
no
signs
of
decay
when
removed
from
the
tables
july
twentieth
the
same
is
true
of
a
collection
of
holland
pippins
and
mcintoshes
placed
on
exhibition
at
the
same
time
a
collection
of
alexanders
from
collamer
of
hilton
will
serve
as
an
illustration
of
the
advantages
of
picking
at
the
proper
time
handling
with
care
and
placing
in
cold
storage
immediately
these
apples
were
exhibited
for
a
week
at
the
state
fair
held
at
syracuse
in
september
of
they
were
then
wrapped
packed
and
sent
to
louis
where
they
were
kept
in
cold
storage
until
june
when
they
were
placed
on
exhibition
until
after
the
visit
of
governor
odell
june
on
june
thirtieth
they
were
rewrapped
and
repacked
and
sent
back
to
cold
storage
until
a
few
days
before
the
state
fair
at
syracuse
in
september
of
when
they
were
shipped
to
syracuse
and
again
exhibited
for
a
week
at
the
close
of
the
state
fair
they
were
again
returned
to
louis
and
exhibited
for
two
weeks
the

is
another
variety
which
showed
excellent
keeping
qualities
on
august
twelfth
a
collection
of
plates
from
henry
lewis
of
annandale
was
taken
out
of
cold
storage
and
placed
on
exhibition
they
held
up
in
good
condition
until
the
thirtieth
of
august
during
the
hottest
weather
of
the
season
the
greenings
while
large
in
size
of
fine
color
and
apparently
in
perfect
condition
when
packed
invariably
came
out
of
cold
storage
badly
scalded
and
discolored
in
fact
there
were
only
three
or
four
lots
which
were
entirely
free
from
scald
in
september
large
additions
of
new
fruit
were
made
to
the
exhibit
from
individual
growers
and
also
from
the
new

agricultural
experiment
station
at
geneva
george

among

of
their
exhibits

complete
list
of
the
varieties

grapes
the
grape
industry
of
new
york
had
adequate
and
successful
representation
at
the
louis
exposition
as
a
department
of
the
general
horticultural
exhibit
this
industry
in
new
york
is
one
of
large
and
steadily
increasing
importance
the
state
ranks
second
only
to
california
in
the
production
of
grapes
and
the
showing
made
in
the
horticulture
building
was
a
revelation
to
thousands
of
visitors
who
there
obtained
their
first
knowledge
of
the
extent
of
the
viticulture
industry
in
new
york
this
sign
was
conspicuously
displayed
over
the
exhibit
of
grapes
new
york
leads
in
table
grapes
acres
vines
crop
worth
annually
these
figures
are
from
census
reports
and
represent
an
advance
of
per
cent
in
the
industry
over
its
condition
as
represented
at
the
columbian
exposition
in
there
is
scarcely
another
such
record
of
increase
in
the
whole
range
of
industries
of
the
united
states
no
attempt
was
made
to
show
viticulture
in
any
other
way
than
by
its
product
but
an
almost
continuous
display
of
grapes
was
kept
on
the
tables
from
the
opening
of
the
exposition
to
its
close
this
in
itself
was
a
noteworthy
achievement
for
it
included
a
display
of
cold
storage
grapes
from
the
crop
of
up
to
the
second
week
of
july
something
never
before
attempted
a
display
of
forced
fruit
and
early
varieties
began
shortly
after
that
date
a
collection
of
grapes
grown
by
david
dunning
of
auburn
was
an
interesting
feature
of
the
grape
exhibit
and
amazed
crowds
of
visitors
on
account
of
their
size
and
handsome
appearance
the
varieties
were
barbarossa
and
muscat
hamburg
one
cluster
of
the
latter
variety
weighed
nine
pounds
and
measured
seventeen
inches
in
length
exclusive
of
stem
this
collection
of
grapes
far
surpassed
anything
of
the
kind
shown
in
the
horticulture
building
not
even
excepting
california
specimens
the
varieties
in
cold
storage
were
as
follows
catawba
diana
iona
isabella
niagara
salem
and
virgennes
of
these
varieties
the
catawba
and
virgennes
kept
the
longest
they
were
taken
from
cold
storage
july
third
and
placed
upon
exhibition
for
a
week
at
the
end
of
which
time
they
were
found
to
have
retained
their
color
and
flavor
perfectly
this
was
fully
one
month
later
than
grapes
were
preserved
at
the
exposition
notwithstanding
the
difference
in
distance
between
buffalo
and
louis
from
the
vineyards
the
diana
and
iona
were
close
seconds
in
keeping
qualities
while
the
isabella
rattled
badly
and
the
niagara
showed
discoloration
though
both
retained
fairly
good
flavor
the
display
proper
of
the
crop
began
early
in
september
this
display
was
entirely
made
up
of
fruit
contributed
by
the
growers
of
the
chautauqua
and
keuka
lake
districts
these
two
districts
were
represented
about
in
proportion
to
their
acreages
and
products
the
grapes
were
well
wrapped
in
paper
and
packed
in
a
new
style
paper
grape
basket
furnished
by
mullen
paper
company
of
joseph
michigan
these
baskets
were
packed
in
spring
crates
and
the
grapes
with
a
very
few
exceptions
carried
in
perfect
condition
the
grape
exhibit
was
made
adjacent
to
the
rest
of
the
new
york
exhibit
the
tables
afforded
room
for
about
plates
the
display
was
made
up
largely
of
concord
catawba
niagara
virgennes
campbell
early
and
other
commercial
varieties
the
rarer
varieties
however
were
not
neglected
as
will
be
seen
from
the
list
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
varieties
appearing
elsewhere
pears
in
october
of

to
be
used
for
the
exposition
of
this
number
boxes
were
purchased
from
david
bell
of
brighton
and
the
balance
came
in
single
bushels
from
some
of
the
best
growers
of
the
state
the
pears
like
the
apples
were
wrapped
first
in
heavy

and
then
in

notwithstanding
this
fact
a

collect
this
exhibit
but
owing
to
the
very
poor
condition
of
shipments
received
from
illinois
missouri
and
other
nearby
states
the
plan
was
abandoned
as
it
was
feared
that
the
berries
would
be
spoiled
in
transit
one
exhibit
however
was
made
this
was
the
ryckman
strawberry
and
came
from
ryckman
of
brocton
owing
to
extreme
care
in
packing
this
small
exhibit
came
in
fairly
good
condition
and
excited
much
comment
on
account
of
its
size
color
fine
flavor
and
prolific
production
plants
and
flowers
the
exhibit
of
plants
and
flowers
was
for
the
most
part
made
out
of
doors
in
beds
which
were
attractively
laid
out
in
the
grounds
surrounding
the
horticulture
and
agriculture
buildings
the
extent
of
the
grounds
afforded
opportunity
for
the
massing
of
the
different
varieties
of
hardy
plants
such
as
roses
peonies
hydrangeas
and
also
of
the
newer
varieties
of
cannas
and
geraniums
in
the
conservatory
adjoining
the
horticulture
building
proper
were
exhibited
fine
collections
of
ferns
and
a
large
display
of
gladiolas
and
also
one
of
peonies
some
gratifying
comparisons
the
following
statistics
from
the
united
states
census
of
may
be
of
interest
new
york
leads
in
the
production
of
fruit
exclusive
of
subtropical
fruits
twelve
and
per

of
the
fruit
production
of
the
united

is
in

orchard
fruit
of
was
valued
at
grapes
of
were
valued
at
small
fruits
of
were
valued
at
the
following
table
will
give
an
idea
of
the
extensive
cultivation
of
small
fruits
acres
raspberries
strawberries
currants
blackberries
other
berries
number
of
vines
grapes
from
the
following
a
comparison
may
be
drawn
between
the
number
of
trees
and
apple
product
of
the
two
leading
apple
states
number
of
trees
new
york
missouri
the
average
number
of
apple
trees
per
farm
in
the
united
states
was
the
same
for
new
york
was
the
average
production
in
bushels
per
farm
in
the
united
states
was
the
same
for
new
york
was
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
trees
in
missouri
quoted
above
are
young
trees
and
the
relative
products
will
soon
show
far
different
results
unless
new
york
fruit
growers
awake
to
the
situation
in
all
of
the
western
fruit
growing
states
the
annual
planting
of
young
trees
is
rapidly
increasing
a
precaution
which
our
fruit
growers
are
not
taking
to
any
great
extent
moreover
the
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
new
york
growers
in
expositions
and
the
opportunity
there
afforded
for
advertising
the
superiority
of
new
york
products
is
a
subject
for
comment
it
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
interest
and
progressive
spirit
of
the
growers
in
the
western
states
who
never
lose
such
an
opportunity
and
are
gradually
working
into
the
front
ranks
of
fruit
production
in
many
of
the
western
states
no
public
funds
nor
machinery
were
provided
for
a
horticultural
exhibit
at
louis
but
very
creditable
exhibits
were
prepared
the
entire
expense
of
the
same
being
borne
by
fruit
growers
associations
in
marked
contrast
is
a
rather
unfortunate
precedent
heretofore
adopted
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
of
necessity
followed
at
louis
viz
that
the
state
in
order
to
obtain
a
creditable
exhibit
must
pay
a
fancy
price
for
fruit
for
exhibition
purposes
and
allow
the
seller
to
receive
the
award
upon
fruit
which
is
no
longer
his
own
property
the
staff
in
addition
to
the
superintendent
the
staff
connected
with
the
department
consisted
of
james
patterson
of
sheridan
assistant
superintendent
john
coughtry
of
new
scotland
and
sherman
lewis
of
johnsonburg
assistants
in
charge
of
fruit
exhibit
loomis
of
fredonia
assistant
in
charge
of
viticulture
and
miss
bessie
hutchinson
of
rochester
stenographer
one
and
all
they
served
the
commission
and
the
state
faithfully
and
efficiently
awards
the
state
received
a
total
of
awards
divided
as
follows
a
grand
prize
for
installation
a
grand
prize
for
the
collective
state
exhibit
of
fruit
gold
medals
silver
medals
and
bronze
medals
owing
to
the
rules
and
regulations
governing
the
system
of
awards
however
prizes
were
not
so
freely
distributed
as
at
the
world
fair
at
chicago
or
the
pan
american
exposition
at
buffalo
heretofore
it
has
always
been
the
custom
to
allow
the
exhibitor
a
medal
for
a
collection
of
apples
another
for
a
collection
of
pears
another
for
plums
while
at
louis
only
one
award
was
allowed
an
exhibitor
for
his
entire
collective
exhibit
the
jury
in
the
department
of
horticulture
was
on
duty
throughout
the
exposition
period
and
as
soon
as
an
exhibit
was
placed
upon
the
tables
it
was
promptly
passed
upon
by
the
jury
due
application
having
been
made
of
exhibitors
in
the
department
of
horticulture
with
the
award

by

of

commission
state
of

the
state
exhibit
in
the
forest
fish
and

department
was
prepared
and
installed
by
the
forest
fish
and

commission
with
funds
furnished
by
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
a
sportsman
camp
a
modern
sportsman
camp
of
rustic
design
fourteen
feet
by
seventeen
feet
in
size
was
constructed
and
furnished
after
the
general
style
and
appearance
of
the
usual
summer
residence
in
the
adirondack
mountains
the
contractor
for
the
erection
of
this
camp
was
the
firm
of
b
sperry
of
old
forge
sperry
frank
as
he
is
known
to
visitors
to
the
adirondacks
had
personal
charge
of
the
construction
and
was
something
of
an
exhibit
himself
being
a
lifelong
adirondack
guide
and
having
been
employed
by
many
prominent
people
among
others
harrison
any
rustic
work
from
his
hand
was
sure
to
attract
attention
it
was
unfortunate
that
it
was
impossible
to
have
him
or
some
other
adirondack
guide
in
attendance
at
the
camp
all
through
the
season
as
many
visitors
wished
to
see
and
talk
with
some
such
person
some
of
them
seeing
the
sperry
on
the
end
of
a
log
of
the
camp
inquired
for
frank
expecting
to
find
him
in
attendance
he
has
had
many
inquiries
from
people
residing
at
widely
separated
places
in
various
parts
of
the
country
for
duplicates
of
the
camp
exhibit
or
for
some
other
design
of
rustic
building
construction
of
the
camp
the
camp
was
constructed
of
adirondack
spruce
logs
and
the
chimney
was
of
the
same
external
construction
the
roof
was
covered
with
spruce
bark
all
the
material
showing
inside
the
camp
was
as
far
as
possible
left
in
natural
condition
the
logs
with
the
bark
on
and
the
underside
of
the
roof
boards
unplaned
showing
the
coarse
saw
marks
innumerable
inquiries
were
made
by
interested
visitors
particularly
those
coming
from
the
southern
and
western
states
as
to
the
species
of
timber
used
in
constructing
the
camp
when
informed
that
the
logs
were
of
spruce
much
interest
was
shown
many
had
never
seen
spruce
before
the
furniture
a
part
of
the
furniture
was
built
by
sperry
and
the
remainder
by
another
adirondack
guide
sumner
of
saranac
lake
sperry
made
the
bedstead
the
window
settee
and
the
center
table
after
a
style
that
is
common
in
the
adirondack
camps
the
woodwork
was
of
spruce
turned
smooth
and
stained
a
light
smoke
color
to
give
it
a
finished
appearance
sumner
constructed
the
other
furniture
in
the
best
rustic
style
the
framework
being
of
white
cedar
with
the
bark
on
and
the
bottoms
of
the
chairs
and
settees
of
white
birch
bark
both
of
these
guides
have
had
many
inquiries
for
duplicates
of
their
handiwork
as
exhibited
the
atmosphere
of
the
camp
was
that
of
everyday
life
in
the
forest
the
bed
was
made
up
as
though
the
owner
was
expected
to
occupy
it
at
night
garments
and
articles
that
had
seen
service
such
as
a
leather
hunting
jacket
a
gun
case
pack
baskets
fish
reels
and
snow
shoes
were
hung
on
the
walls
in
proper
places
attractive
features
the
mantel
and
fireplace
particularly
attracted
attention
the
mantel
was
of
spruce
with
the
bark
on
and
the
fireplace
was
constructed
with
a
stone
facing
and
lining
showing
andirons
and
birch
logs
in
place
as
in
actual
use
in
one
corner
there
was
shelving
for
fishing
tackle
ammunition
constructed
by
utilizing
a
discarded
fishing
boat
cutting
the
same
across
the
center
into
two
parts
and
placing
shelves
at
convenient
intervals
fastening
the
same
on
the
ribs
of
the
boat
in
another
corner
was
a
swing
table
that
could
be
hung
up
against
the
wall
when
not
in
use
on
the
mantel
were
placed
articles
of
rustic
work
that
harmonized
with
the
surroundings
a
rustic
clock
wooden
pipes
and
smoking
set
to
match
a
stein
and
mug
of
wood
together
with
other
articles
of
ornament
and
utility
a
piece
of
library
shelving
of
unique
design
and
special
construction
was
provided
and
furnished
with
standard
publications
on
fish
birds
and
animals
and
stories
of
life
in
the
forest
and
of
the
chase
thirty
books
were
shown
a
number
of
which
were
kindly
furnished
by
doubleday
page
of
new
york
city
on
the
center
table
were
kept
the
current
numbers
of
the
leading
sporting
magazines
both
weekly
and
monthly
wall
decorations
the
walls
were
decorated
with
bright
colored
indian
blankets
flags
and
souvenir
paddles
on
which
were
painted
various
national
flags
and
camping
scenes
the
paddles
being
of
a
very
white
spruce
and
the
background
being
the
spruce
logs
of
the
camp
with
dark
colored
bark
the
effect
was
pleasing
and
attracted
much
attention
an
interesting
and
valuable
feature
of
the
furnishing
and
decoration
of
the
camp
and
incidentally
souvenirs
of
the
chase
were
a
large
fine
moose
head
over
the
mantel
an
elk
head
on
the
gable
outside
heads
at
the
sides
of
the
porch
in
front
of
the
camp
and
the
furs
of
red
foxes
deer
and
black
bear
some
of
the
furs
were
specially
prepared
for
rugs
and
placed
on
the
floor
of
the
camp
giving
the
interior
an
air
of
comfort
and
cheerfulness
hunting
and
fishing
outfit
the
hunting
and
fishing
outfit
consisted
of
two
repeating
rifles
one
a
savage
and
the
other
a
winchester
a
shotgun
three
fishing
rods
one
each
of
steel
split
lancewood
and
split
bamboo
and
a
collection
which
included
trout
flies
landing
nets
minnow
pail
reels
lines
cartridge
belt
loading
set
and
other
paraphernalia
a
of
the
latest
style
and
of
superior
workmanship
was
a
part
of
the
sportsman
outfit
this
boat
was
kindly
loaned
by
the
manufacturer
fred
rice
formerly
of
saranac
lake
but
now
living
at
seattle
his
son
continues
the
manufacture
of
at
lake
placid
balsam
pillows
on
the
settee
and
bed
in
the
camp
were
a
number
of
balsam
pillows
a
large
and
particularly
fine
one
came
from
the
higby
camp
on
big
moose
lake
in
the
adirondacks
it
was
made
by
miss
lila
daisy
higby
a
little
lady
only
seven
years
of
age
whose
needlework
decorating
the
cover
showed
artistic
ability
of
great
merit
for
one
so
young
many
visitors
admired
it
and
some
of
them
have
written
her
in
complimentary
terms
the
odor
from
these
pillows
filled
the
camp
and
instantly
attracted
the
attention
of
visitors
one
of
the
questions
usually
asked
first
of
the
attendant
was
where
the
perfume
came
from
and
what
it
was
some
supposed
it
to
be
from
the
logs
of
which
the
camp
was
constructed
many
visitors
wanted
to
know
where
they
could
obtain
such
pillows
those
purchased
for
the
camp
came
from
church
boonville
who
also
furnished
the
gun
rack
so
much
admired
and
also
the
fur
rugs
fire
notice
on
the
side
of
the
camp
in
a
conspicuous
place
was
posted
a
fire
notice
such
as
may
be
found
in
thousands
of
places
along
the
trail
throughout
the
adirondacks
and
catskills
visitors
that
had
been
through
our
mountains
recognized
this
feature
instantly
for
these
notices
may
be
found
at
all
the
hotels
and
public
places
and
also
on
a
great
many
of
the
private
camps
this
little
placard
printed
on
cloth
attracted
much
attention
it
contains
our
forest
fire
rules
and
much
of
the
law
relative
to
woodland
fires
many
persons
interested
in
forestry
many
of
them
from
foreign
countries
copied
the
notice
verbatim
it
is
probable
that
similar
rules
and
regulations
will
be
incorporated
in
the
forestry
laws
of
other
states
and
countries
an
attendant
was
employed
at
the
camp
who
answered
the
numerous
questions
as
to
where
the
various
articles
of
furniture
and
decoration
might
be
obtained
much
information
was
also
sought
by
visitors
in
relation
to
the
adirondack
forests
and
the
summer
resorts
of
new
york
in
general
this
sportsman
camp
was
the
only
exhibit
of
the
kind
shown
at
the
fair
sportsmen
and
lovers
of
life
in
the
woods
from
all
parts
of
the
land
visited
it
many
were
ecstatic
in
its
praises
some
complimented
it
by
saying
it
was
the
most
artistic
feature
of
the
whole
forestry
fish
and
game
exhibit
it
was
photographed
perhaps
more
than
one
hundred
times
during
the
season
and
in
one
instance
by
nine
different
persons
on
a
single
day
animals
and
birds
the
fur
and
game
animals
and
birds
of
the
state
were
represented
by
mounted
specimens
prepared
by
professional
taxidermists
in
many
instances
they
were
shown
in
pairs
male
and
female
the
space
in
front
of
the
camp
and
also
at
one
side
was
inclosed
by
a
rustic
fence
built
of
round
spruce
in
the
yard
at
the
side
was
placed
a
tree
about
twelve
feet
high
and
under
it
was
prepared
an
artificial
ground
work
in
imitation
of
a
woodland
area
after
a
recent
snow
storm
in
and
about
this
tree
and
forming
a
part
of
the
picture
were
placed
in
position
as
true
to
life
and
natural
conditions
as
possible

position
and
a
small
white
doe
arranged
among
bushes
in
the
snow
scene
at
the
side
of
the
camp
this
family
was
most
lifelike
and
pleasing
in
appearance
white
deer
are
very
unusual
but
not
unnatural
one
of
them
is
killed
in
this
state
about
every
two
years
moose
and
elk
are
introduced
animals
with
us
now
and
as
it
is
illegal
to
kill
any
life
size
specimens
could
not
well
be
shown
however
very
good
heads
were
exhibited
as
a
part
of
the
decoration
of
the
camp
albinos
of
muskrat
and
porcupine
were
exhibited
such
freakish
specimens
attract
more
attention
than
those
of
usual
growth
rare
species
in
addition
to
the
animals
scheduled
above
were
specimens
of
some
species
that
are
probably
extinct
in
the
adirondacks
a
gray
wolf
and
a
panther
the
gray
wolf
was
an
excellent
specimen
loaned
by
general
mcalpin
of
new
york
city
it
was
killed
about
eight
years
ago
on
his
preserve
in
the
northern
part
of
hamilton
county
and
none
have
been
seen
since
the
panther
was
killed
about
years
ago
by
hon
verplanck
colvin
in
the
southern
part
of
hamilton
county
and
is
the
last
one
heard
of
in
the
state
of
new
york
the
black
bear
was
an
unusually
fine
specimen
killed
in
sullivan
county
it
was
mounted
to
order
by
fred
sauter
of
new
york
city
for
this
exhibit
and
without
doubt
was
the
best
representative
of
this
species
at
the
fair
experts
in
the
art
of
taxidermy
and
naturalists
were
enthusiastic
in
its
praise
the
great
blue
heron
was
loaned
by
grant
winchester
of
saranac
inn
it
was
a
very
good
specimen
and
was
mounted
by
miner
of
saranac
lake
y
the
animals
were
placed
about
the
camp
under
the
trees
in
connection
with
the
collection
of
birds
in
positions
as
true
to
life
as
possible
in
the
available
space
making
a
picture
of
woodland
life
delightful
to
the
eye
and
interesting
to
every
person
that
visited
the
palace
of
forestry
fish
and
game
fish
the
fish
exhibit
consisted
of
mounted
specimens
representing
species
most
of
them
prepared
specially
for
this
display
by
the
best
workmen
in
the
country
substantially
all
the
food
and
game
fish
were
shown
in
preparing
this
collection
no
attempt
with
one
exception
was
made
to
show
abnormally
large
specimens
the
intention
was
to
show
the
average
fish
true
to
life
in
color
size
and
contour
both
fresh
and
salt
water
species
were
represented
the
collection
which
is
undoubtedly
the
best
in
the
country
comprised
the
following
species

in
addition
to
the
specimens
there
was
shown
an
interesting
collection
of
shell
fish
including
different
varieties
of
oysters
together
with
the
enemies
of
the
same
such
as
the
drill
and
starfish
a
number
of
exhibits
showing
curiosities
of
oyster
growth
were
in
this
collection
the
fish
were
displayed
in
six
cabinets
constructed
to
order
for
the
exhibit
they
were
lined
with
black
plush
thus
forming
a
strong
contrast
with
the
colors
of
the
various
pieces
the
salmon
mentioned
above
is
one
of
the
finest
pieces
extant
not
only
in
relation
to
size
but
also
in
the
mounting
of
the
same
it
is
owned
by
hon
allds
norwich
and
was
kindly
loaned
by
him
for
this
exhibit
a
great
northern
pike
that
weighed
pounds
when
caught
was
in
the
collection
it
was
loaned
by
ferris
j
meigs
of
new
york
city
and
was
caught
in
follensbee
pond
in
the
adirondacks
by
miss
juliet
wilbur
tompkins
in
this
is
the
largest
pike
sometimes
erroneously
called
pickerel
within
the
knowledge
of
the
forest
fish
and
game
commission
general
nomenclature
all
the
specimens
of
animals
birds
and
fish
were
properly
and
uniformly
labeled
giving
the
names
the
various
species
are
generally
known
by
and
also
the
scientific
nomenclature
adopted
by
naturalists
the
importance
of
this
matter
of
nomenclature
was
demonstrated
very
early
during
the
fair
the
song
birds
being
very
small
no
labels
were
placed
upon
them
at
first
as
the
labels
were
in
some
instances
larger
than
the
birds
the
fact
that
visitors
examining
the
specimens
would
often
search
for
the
attendant
in
order
to
obtain
information
as
to
the
names
of
the
different
birds
exhibited
proved
the
necessity
of
clearly
labeling
all
specimens
on
the
other
hand
there
seemed
to
be
a
general
misunderstanding
as
to
some
species
of
fish
various
names
being
applied
to
the
same
species
visitors
were
constantly
requesting
information
on
these
points
the
northern
pike
are
by
many
people
called
pickerel
and
sometimes
when
in
water
with
pickerel
are
mistaken
for
muscallonge
the
distinguishing
marks
were
frequently
explained
to
interested
visitors
forestry
one
of
the
most
scientific
and
practical
features
of
the
new
york
exhibit
was
that
made
by
the
forestry
department
it
was
prepared
to
show
the
method
by
which
the
forestry
commission
is
reforesting
large
areas
of
state
land
that
have
been
denuded
by
repeated
fires
a
forest
nursery
the
most
important
part
of
this
was
a
fully

the
seeds
were
sown
about
the
first
of
may
they
germinated
well
and
the
little
trees
grew
thriftily
the
catalpa
reaching
a
height
of
eighteen
inches
before
the

being
spaced
four
or
five
inches
apart
where
they
remain
for
two
or
three
years
more
before
they
are
placed
finally
in
the
forest
six
beds
were
devoted
to
showing
this
feature
of
nursery
work

norway
spruce
and
scotch
pine
were
the
species
used
these
were
about
three
feet
high
and
were
spaced
about
four
feet
apart
to
show
how
the
species
are
raised
for

the
names
of
the
species
were
printed
plainly
on
neat
board
labels
ten
inches
long
by
five
inches
broad
the
nursery
was
kept
free
from
weeds
and
was
watered
each
evening
during
a
long
drought
which
began
about
the
first
of
september
and
continued
till
the
fair
closed
thousands
of
people
visited
the
nursery
attracted
to
it
not
only
by
the
beauty
of
the
small
green
trees
arranged
in
such
interesting
manner
but
also
because
of
the
instruction
it
afforded
in
the
science
of
forestry
foresters
botanists
seedsmen
and
others
interested
in
trees
in
a
scientific
or
practical
way
many
of
whom
were
from
abroad
gave
the
nursery
close
scrutiny
the
forester
in
charge
who
prepared
the
nursery
knechtel
of
albany
was
kept
constantly
busy
answering
the
numerous
questions
not
only
concerning
the
exhibit
but
also
in
regard
to
the
important
work
being
done
by
the
forestry
department
in
restoring
the
forests
upon
the
denuded
lands
of
the
state
in
a
corner
of
the
nursery
stood
two
interesting
of
white
pine
and
white

inches
and
sixteen
inches
in
diameter
respectively
each
having
forty
annual
rings
plainly
visible
showing
that
in
forty
years
under
favorable
conditions
trees
of
these
species
can
be
grown
from
seed
to
the
given
diameters
forestry
tools
and
instruments
within
the
building
were
exhibited

used
in
forestry
practice
a
collection
of
the
seeds
of
native
forest
trees
of
the
state
and
the
photographs
of
eighty
of
our
more
important
trees
showing
the

trees
the
exhibit
of
insects
affecting
forest
and
shade
trees
was
prepared
by
felt
new
york
state
entomologist
and
was
a
small
though
representative
collection
designed
to
show
the
life
history
and
habits
in
particular
of
the
more
injurious
forms
of
insects
affecting
shade
and
forest
trees
in
new
york
state
a
special
effort
was
made
to
depict
so
far
as
possible
the
life
history
habits
and
methods
of
work
of
the
forms
possessing
economic
importance
and
to
show
whenever
possible
the
natural
enemies
of
value
in
keeping
these
species
in
control
this
collection
was
arranged
in
a
specially
designed
case
having
a
series
of
three
nearly
horizontal
trays
and
inches
by
eighteen
and
inches
upon
each
side
and
an
elevated
central
portion
bearing
two
nearly
perpendicular
ones
upon
each
side
the
middle
being
occupied
by
a
glass
case
containing
an
attractive
natural
group
a
brief
account
of
the
exhibit
under
appropriate
heads
is
as
follows
this
collection
occupying
two
nearly
perpendicular
trays
and
representing
the
work
of
species
was
devoted
to
the
peculiar
and
varied
vegetable
deformities
produced
by
insects
these
structures
are
always
of
great
popular
interest
and
the
insects
causing
the
same
present
biologic
problems
of
unusual
attractiveness
the
species
affecting
forest
trees
in
particular
were
exhibited
in
three
horizontal
trays
occupying
one
side
of
the
case
this
section
was
devoted
principally
to
representing
the
biology
and
methods
of
work
of
this
exceedingly
important
group
like
that
representing
forest
insects
the
exhibit
of
pests
was
very
largely
biologic
it
occupied
three
horizontal
trays
and
a
nearly
vertical
one
of
the
exhibit
case
and
was
devoted
to
species
which
are
destructive
largely
on
account
of
their
depredations
upon
shade
trees
this
was
a
small
collection
occupying
one
of
the
nearly
perpendicular
trays
and
comprised
over
one
hundred
species
this
portion
of
the
exhibit
represented
the
more
characteristic
forms
occurring
in
the
adirondacks
group
of
forest
this
group
occupied
the
central
glass
box
and
contained
species
of
insects
or
representations
of
their
work
upon
wax
models
of
their
food
plants
namely
white
birch
red
oak
elm
and
maple
eleven
species
of
beetles
fifteen
of
butterflies
and
moths
two
of
the
bee
family
and
three
of
the
bug
family
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
plants
or
on
the
ground
at
their
base
this
group
gave
an
excellent
idea
of
the
appearance
of
insects
when
amid
their
natural
surroundings
colored
plates
a
series
of
quarto
and
octavo
colored
plates
illustrating
the
work
and
various
stages
of
some
of
the
more
important
depredators
upon
forest
and
shade
trees
was
exhibited
in
two
frames
attached
to
the
top
of
this

of
specimens
of
all
the
native
woods
of
new
york
built
into
panel
work
showing
both
sides
each

one
rough
species
of
native
and
nine
species
of
introduced
woods
were
exhibited
in
this
manner
displaying
the
several
species
in
four
different
ways
enabled
the
discriminating
observer
to
study
and
compare
the
various
woods
profitably
the
manner
of
labeling
was
greatly
appreciated
some
students
copied
all
the
labels
each
spending
many
hours
on
this
task

exhibit
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
commission
generously
set
aside
the
sum
of
being
unable
to
secure
as
much
space
as
was
needed
and
for
the
additional
reason
that
the
salaries
of
some
of
the
persons
collaborating
on
the
exhibit
were
provided
for
in
another

it
was
not
necessary
to

and
by
a
separate
force
paid
from
the
funds
of
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
commission
it
would
have
undoubtedly
cost
the
state
not
less
than
but
the
fact
that
considerable
material
was
available
from
former
exhibits
and
from
the
office
of
the
forest

commission
and
the
further
fact
as
above
stated
that
some
of
the
collaborators
received
their
compensation
from
the
funds
of
that
commission
enabled
the

the
exhibit
in
this
department
differed
somewhat
from
the
state
exhibits
in
other
departments
in
that
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
articles
which
were
loaned
by
private
parties
to
complete
or
supplement
the
collections
the
showing
was
exclusively
a
state
exhibit
some
surprising
facts
the
exhibit
as
a
whole
was
immensely
popular
from
the
very
first
day
the
people
visiting
the
exposition
were
largely
from
the
southern
and
middle
western
states
and
seemed
very
generally
to
believe
that
new
york
forests
fish
and
game
has
passed
away
with
the
advance
of
civilization
most
of
them
were
greatly
surprised
to
learn
that
of
the
state
is
wild
land
which
will
in
all
probability
always
be
devoted
largely
to
forests
and
that
the
state
has
so
many
wild
deer
that
of
them
are
killed
annually
without
any
apparent
decrease
of
the
number
the
sportsman
camp
served
the
purpose
of
advertising
the
great
adirondack
region
as
a
summer
resort
and
a
great
many
visitors
expressed
their
intention
of
visiting
that
locality
in
the
near
future
probably
one
of
the
best
features
of
the
exhibit
was
the
work
shown
by
the
commission
in
progressive
forestry
this
state
being
in
the
van
of
the
forestry
movement
was
looked
to
to
point
out
the
path
of
professional
forestry
and
if
no
other
award
had
been
made
than
the
grand
prize
by
the
scientific
jury
that
served
in
that
department
we
would
feel
as
though
our
efforts
has
been
appreciated
and
that
our
labors
had
not
been
in
vain

illustration
as
in
previous
expositions
at
which
the
state
of
new
york
has
been
an
exhibitor
the
scientific
exhibits
were
made
through
the
organization
of
the
state
museum
merrill
the
director
of
the
museum
assigned
to
the
writer
the
duty
of
preparing
the
exhibit
to
be
made
under
his
direction
the
available
time
and
money
entered
largely
into
the
settlement
of
the
question
of
what
form
the
exhibit
should
take
scope
of
exhibit
it
was
thought
best
to
confine
the
scope
of
the
main
exhibit
to
the
technologic
and
commercial
aspects
of
geology
and
mineralogy
a
judicious
selection
of
materials
made
to
show
the
mineral
wealth
of
the
state
was
considered
more
desirable
than
to
make
merely
a
large
display
many
of
the
materials
exhibited
were
taken
from
the
state
museum
collections
supplemented
where
necessary
by
such
additions
as
could
be
obtained
within
the
required
time
the
benefit
derived
by
the
state
from
such
exhibits
is
often
much
more
apparent
than
that
which
is
to
be
derived
by
the
individual
exhibitors
and
on
this
account
the
commission
is
particularly
indebted
to
those
firms
and
individuals
which
went
to
considerable
expense
in
preparing
exhibits
along
lines
which
were
intended
more
to
represent
all
phases
of
an
industry
rather
than
to
show
the
products
of
a
single
firm
those
deserving
especial
mention
in
this
connection
are
the
solvay
process
company
of
syracuse
the
mathews
consolidated
slate
company
of
boston
the
helderberg

used
were
taken
from

and
suitable
stands
for

and
other
exhibits
were
constructed
in
albany
on
account
of
the
weight
of
the
specimens
exhibited
the

had
to
be
strengthened
this
work
as
well
as
the
building
of

was
done
under

by
caldwell
and

may
be
divided
into
the
metallic
and
groups
iron
in
the
first
division
in
our
state
iron
is
by
far
the
most
important
and
probably
the
one
with
which
the
people
of
the
state
are
least
acquainted
a
few
years
ago
new

stood
near
the
head
of
the
iron
producing
states
the
depression
in
the
iron
industries
commencing
about
and
the
discovery
about
that
time
of
the
seemingly
inexhaustible
deposits
of
rich
ores
in
the
lake
superior
region
however
resulted
in
shutting
down
nearly
all
of
our
mines
for
the
last
few
years
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
them
and
they
seem
to
have
been
popularly
supposed
to
have
been
worked
out
the
exposition
gave
an
opportunity
of
showing
this
supposition
to
be
incorrect
and
recent
investigations
show
that
the
deposits
are
of
much
greater
extent
and
value
than
was
known
in
the
eighties
with
but
one
or
two
exceptions
none
of
the
mines
then
worked
are
exhausted
and
immense
bodies
of
valuable
ore
have
not
been
touched
most
of
the
localities
were
represented
by

including
some
beautiful
specimens
of

a
feature
of
the

exhibit
was
a
magnetic
separator
supplied
by
the
wetherill
separator
company
of
new
york
this
was
kept
at
work
on
the
magnetite
ores
from
mineville
and
was
of
great
interest
not
only
in
showing
the
method
of
concentrating
the
magnetic
ore
but
also
in
saving
the
phosphorus
which
occurs
in
the
form
of
the
mineral
apatite
and
which
is
of
considerable
value
in

many
other
localities
have
yielded
small
quantities
of

was
exhibited
in
the
form
of
cubes
arranged
on
three
pyramidal
stands
only
a
few
of
these
were
especially
collected
for
this
exposition
many
more
which
were
considered
desirable
could
not
be
obtained
in

and
were
well
represented
some
of
them
showing
as
fine
a
polished

sandstones
the
state
is
also
rich
in
sandstones
of
good
quality
the
potsdam
sandstone
forms
an
almost
complete
belt
around
the
adirondacks
and
is
an
excellent
building
stone
its
color
is
from
white
to
pale
red
and
in
many
places
it
is
an
extremely
hard
quartzite
specimens
were
shown
from
potsdam
lawrence
county
the
white
sandstones
of
washington
county
have
been
extensively
used
for
refractory
purposes
in
the
manufacture
of
steel
being
almost
free
from
iron
the
medina
sandstones
are
quarried
in
the
neighborhood
of
medina
albion
and
lockport
while
a
pure
white
stone
occurs
at
lewiston
the
medina
stone
is
generally
of
a
pinkish
red
color
it
is
extensively
used
as
a
building
stone
particularly
in
buffalo
and
rochester
it
is
valuable
for
paving
curbing
and
flagging
the
medina
sandstone
company
exhibited
a
piece
of
wall
work
to
show
the
various
methods
of
finish
including
a
finely
carved
lintel
a
number
of
cubes
were
exhibited
from
various
quarries
the
sandstones
of
southern
new
york
occurring
in
the
rocks
of
devonian
age
are
generally
fine
grained
and
blue
or
greenish
in
color
and
are
known
as
bluestones
most
of
the
quarries
are
in
the
counties
of
greene
ulster
broome
delaware
and
sullivan
they
are
described
in
new
york
state
museum
bulletin
by
harold
dickinson
there
is
a
great
variety
in
color
and
physical
properties
of
stone
from
these
quarries
it
is
used
as
building
stone
and
for
trimming
and
some
of
it
is
especially
valuable
for
large
platforms
a
large
proportion
of
the
output
is
in
the
form
of
flagging
and
curbstone
the
hudson
river
bluestone
company
exhibited
a
piece
of
wall
built
into
the
base
of
the
pyramidal
stand
holding
the
sandstone
cubes
this
was
designed
to
show
the
ease
with
which
it
can
be
worked
and
included
some
finely
carved
lettering
the
main
entrance
to
the
exhibit
was
paved
with
flags
and
tiles
of
this
material
slate
with
the
sandstones
were
shown
some
cubes
of
slate
cut
from
the
quarries
of
the
mathews
consolidated
slate
company
of
boston
which
operates
a
number
of
quarries
in
washington
county
the
slate
belt
covers
an
area
of
about
square
miles
the
larger
part
of
which
is
in
washington
county
but
which
extends
across
the
line
into
rutland
county
vt
this
is
probably
the
richest
slate
region
in
the
world
the
beds
are
of
great
thickness
belonging
to
two
distinct
geologic
formations
they
are
folded
on
one
another
in
such
a
manner
as
to
present
the
workable
beds
in
long
parallel
ridges
on
account
of
its
great
strength
and
easy
working
qualities
new
uses
are
constantly
being
found
for
slate
one
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
slate
exhibit
was
a
mantel
built
of
rough
slabs
of
dark
red
slate
showing
the
cross
fracture
to
have
a
fine
satiny
texture
this
was
a
copy
of
a
mantel
designed
by
lord
hewlet
of
new
york
and
built
in
a
poultney
residence
the
main
slate
exhibit
consisted
of
a
stand
supporting
a
slated
roof
one
side
of
which
was
covered
with
unfading
green
slates
one
inch
thick
such
as
were
laid
on
senator

residence
the
other
side
was
covered
with
rough
thick
slabs
of
unfading
red
the
sides
of
the
stand
were
covered
with
the
regular
trade
slates
in
four
sections
red
green
purple
and
variegated
the
uses
of
slate
for
construction
purposes
were
shown
by
slabs
and
panels
on
the
upper
part
of
the
stand
cement
the
cement
exhibit
was
made
by
the
helderberg
cement
company
of
howes
cave
one
side
of
the
exhibit
stand
was
devoted
to
portland
and
the
other
to
natural
cements
barrels
and
bags
of
finished
cement
formed
the
base
of
the
structure
on
which
were
glass
jars
containing
the
rock
in
its
stages
of
manufacture
with
a
series
of
photographs
of
the
works
and
of
buildings
of
cement
on
account
of
the
rapidly
extending
applications
of
cement
a
large
section
outside
of
the
building
was
set
aside
for
exhibits
of
the
uses
of
cement
and
the
exhibit
was
designed
mainly
to
show
the
manufacture
the
materials
used
and
the
method
of
their
treatment
gypsum
gypsum
was
shown
by
a
fine
series
of
specimens
contributed
by
the
united

gypsum
company
from
their
mines
in
western
new
york
this
material
like
cement
is
rapidly
being
adapted
for
a
variety
of
purposes
especially
in
the
finish
and
ornamentation
of
buildings
and
the
exhibit
encased
in
one
of
the
square

with
its
cut
and
polished
cubes
of
raw
gypsum
selenite
crystals
jars
of
stucco
colors
and
examples

made
a
very
attractive
exhibit
in
another
case
there
was
exhibited
gypsum
in
various
forms
from
other
sources

the
salt
exhibit
was
made
up
from
a
very
complete
set
of
specimens
in
sample
jars
taken
from
the
museum
collections
and
a
large
number
of
packages
from
the
manufacturers
the
salt
of
new
york
is
obtained
from
the
salina
formation
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
the
industry
is
of
great
importance
the
deposits
are
described
in
state
museum
bulletin
by

one
of
the
most
interesting
varieties
shown
was
the
solar
salt
which
has
been
made
on
the
onondaga
salt
reservation
syracuse
since
blocks
of
rock
salt
were
shown
from
the
retsof
and
livonia
shafts
most
of
the
salt
produced
however
is
from
wells
bored
down
through
the
rock
salt
beds
and
is
pumped
up
in
the
form
of
brine
and
evaporated
by
artificial
heat
solvay
process
company
the
solvay
process
company
of
syracuse
made
a
splendid
display
of
soda
ash
the
plant
of
this
company
uses
an
immense
amount
of
salt
which
is
obtained
from
the
tully
districts
and
carried
by
pipes
to
solvay
the
raw
materials
used
were
shown
in
the
lower
sections
of
two
cases
especially
constructed
for
the
exhibit
which
also
held
a
set
of
barrels
and
other
packages
in
which
the
soda
is
shipped
in
the
upper
sections
were
shown
a
series
of
large
glass
jars
with
the
various
products
these
were
supplied
with
a
series
of
labels
completely
describing
the
process
of
manufacture
and
the
chemical
changes
which
take
place
above
the
case
there
was
a
set
of
photographs
of
the
works
illustrating
the
social
life
of
the
employed
and
the
growth
of
the
establishment
useful
minerals
the
exhibit
of
the
useful
minerals
of
the
state
was
principally
prepared
by
whitlock
of
the
museum
staff
one
case
contained
a
set
of
the
abrasive
materials
the
most
important
of
these
being
garnet
which
is
found
in
great
quantities
in
the
adirondacks
crude
garnet
from
several
mines
the

were
shown
a
small
millstone
to
represent
the
celebrated
esopus
grit
emery
ore
from
peekskill
and
quartz
and
sand
from
many
localities
were
also
exhibited
in
this
case
another
case
was
filled
with
feldspar
mica
and
quartz
which
usually
occur
associated
with
each
other
in
the
form
of
pegmetite
dikes
in
the
crystalline
rocks
of
the
adirondacks
and
the
highlands
of
the
hudson
these
materials
are
not
as
yet
very
extensively
mined
but
an
increasing
demand
for
them
is
bringing
to
light
many
promising
localities
graphite
another
valuable
mineral
which
occurs
in
the
state
in
great
quantities
is
graphite
specimens
of
both
the
crude
ore
and
manufactured
graphite
were
exhibited
the
deposits
of
this
material
in
the
form
of
graphitic
limestone
cover
miles
of
territory
but
more
satisfactory
processes
for
its
concentration
are
needed
to
make
it
available
for
use
especially
in
the
higher
grades
museum
publications
the
museum
exhibited
a
set
of
its
publications
on
geologic
subjects
a
set
of
published
maps
and
maps
specially
prepared
for
this
exhibit
to
show
the
distribution
of
useful
minerals
and
a
number
of
enlarged
photographs
paleontology
the
exhibit
of
the
department
of
paleontology
consisted
of
a
set
of
its
publications
on
the
paleontology
of
the
state
of
new
york
volumes
covering
the
period
and
a
set
of
wing
frames
with
many
of
the
original
drawings
and
plates
used
in
their
illustration
special
features
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
exhibit
was
an
immense
slab
of
potsdam
sandstone
from
bidwell
crossing
clinton
county
which
was
part
of
the
premoidial
or
cambrian
beach
laid
down
about
the
shores
of
the
adirondack
continental
nucleus
the
slab
shows
the
trails
of
animals
crossing
in
all
directions
especially
those
known
as
clemactechnites
said
by
clarke
to
have
been
made
by
a
a
simple
primitive
type
of
mollusk
the
slab
weighing
over
fifteen
tons
was
moved
in
six
sections
and
put
together
for
exhibition
restorations
in
plaster
of
paris
of
the
fossil
crustaceous
eurypterus
and
hughmilleria
were
also
exhibited
clays
the
exhibition
of
clays
and
clay
products
was
made
by
the
state
school
of
ceramics
at
alfred
under
the
direction
of
professor
charles
binns
and
included
some
large
vases
the
work
of
students
the
state
of
new
york
has
long
held
an
important
place
in
the
brick
trade
on
account
of
its
unlimited
quantities
of
clay
along
the
hudson
river
which
have
not
only
supplied
much
of
the
brick
used
for
building
in
new
york
city
but
bricks
have
been
shipped
from
this
source
long
distances
by
water
the
finer
varieties
of
clay
have
not
been
worked
to
any
extent
except
on
long
island
but
other
conditions
have
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
potteries
at
brooklyn
syracuse
and
other
points
using
almost
exclusively
clays
imported
into
the
state
the
beds
of
feldspar
and
flint
now
being
exploited
in
the
adirondacks
will
materially
help
to
put
this
class
of
potteries
on
a
firmer
basis
the
center
of
the
exhibition
space
was
devoted
to
a
pagoda
designed
to
show
the
kinds
of
brick
manufactured
in
the
principal
localities
the
roof
afforded
an
excellent
place
to
exhibit
earthenware
tiling
the
general
electric
company
exhibited
a
case
of
insulators
many
of
them
of
special
types
from
their
schenectady
pottery
insulators
were
also
exhibited
by
pass

the
petroleum
exhibit
was
made
under
the
general
direction
of
secretary
and
chief
executive
officer
charles
a
ball
an
extensive
series
of
crude

and
occupied
a
case
showing
on
both
sides
on
this
was
installed
a
model
of
a
tower
and
drilling
machinery
such
as
is
used
in
sinking
oil
wells
the
records
printed
on
the
labels
furnished
data
which
made
an
important
addition
to
our
previous
knowledge
of
the
new
york
oil
fields
in
addition
to
those
heretofore
mentioned
the
following
gentlemen

the

of

being
closely
allied
with
the
department
of

and
its
exhibit
being
installed
in
the
palace
of

it
was
placed
under
the
general
charge
of
the
director
of

whose
title
was
changed
to

and
the
state

and
such
other
institutions
or
associations
as
were
properly
included
in
this
class
preparation
of
exhibits
all
of
the
exhibits
of
state
departments
were
prepared
by
the
departments
contributing
them
and
in
the
case
of
the
state
commission
in
lunacy
and
the
state
board
of
charities
the
exhibits
were
installed
by
a
special
representative
this
also
is
true
of
the
exhibit
of
the
state
department
of
prisons
which
required
the
constant
attendance
of
an
expert
to
demonstrate
its
workings
during
the
latter
part
of
the
exposition
period
william
arms
an
attache
of
the
state
building
was
detailed
to
the
department
of
social
economy
and
dividing
his
time
among
the
several
state
exhibits
added
materially
to
the
pleasure
and
knowledge
of
visitors
concerning
new
york
institutions
plan
of
arrangement
the
exposition
authorities
determined
that
the
exhibits
in
the
department
of
social
economy
should
be
collective
that
is
that
all
the
work
in
the
department
of
charities
and
corrections
from
whatever
source
should
be
installed
together
the
same
to
be
true
of
general
betterment
movements
hygiene
municipal
improvement
etc
this
plan
precluded
the
installation
of
the
state
exhibit
in
this
department
in
one
place
with
a
dignified
installation
as
in
the
other
exhibit
departments
and
made
necessary
the
placing
of
the
exhibit
in
several
different
parts
of
the
building
according
to
the
subdivision
of
the
classification
under
which
it
fell
perhaps
from
the
standard
of
general
utility
the
arrangement
was
all
that
could
be
desired
but
from
the
standpoint
of
the
state
it
is
of
doubtful
value
as
such
a
disposition
of
the
state
exhibit
made
no
single
part
of
it
of
any
considerable
size
nor
as
impressive
as
had
the
state
work
in
this
department
been
shown
together
no
state
in
the
union
approaches
the
empire
state
in
its
progressive
policy
in
the
care
of
the
insane
the
destitute
and
delinquents
in
the
solving
of
labor
and
excise
problems
and
had
the
exhibit
in
this
department
been
installed
together
a
most
effective
and
striking
lesson
would
have
been
taught
state
commission
in
lunacy
the
exhibit
of
the
new
york
state
commission
in
lunacy
was
the
most
suggestive
and
comprehensive
of
any
shown
in
the
department
for
the
insane
and
was
designed
primarily
to
show
the
difference
between
the
ancient
and
modern
methods
of
treating
these
unfortunates
two
rooms
were
shown
the
first
of
which
represented
the
primitive
methods
adopted
for
treating
insanity
the
room
was
barren
dark
and
not
over
clean
at
the
front
was
shown
one
of
the
old
taken
from
the
utica
asylum
it
was
of
massive
construction
and
contained
a
small
aperture
covered
by
a
heavy
wooden
blind
through
which
the
attendant
could
observe
the
doings
of
the
patient
or
more
properly
speaking
the
prisoner
within
stood
one
of
the
utica
cribs
built
of
heavy
wood
over
which
was
a
cover
of
wooden
bars
in
this
crib
the
patient
was
obliged
to
remain
in
a
recumbent
position
the
cover
closed
and
locked
near
by
stood
a
restraining
chair
a
whirling
chair
a
straight
jacket
and
shackles
all
representing
ancient
methods
of
quieting
the
victims
of
the
dread
disease
adjoining
was
an
airy
room
clean
and
inviting
made
cheerful
by
growing
plants
and
attractive
furniture
with
every
modern
appliance
for
the
care
of
an
invalid
resembling
closely
a
room
of
the
better
class
in
a
general
hospital
there
was
an
entire
absence
of
any
kind
of
restraint
a
neat
iron
bedstead
rocking
chairs
invalid
table
wash
stand
book
case
with
books
and
in
fact
every
comfort
and
convenience
was
at
hand
in
this
room
were
also
shown
the
uniforms
worn
by
the
nurses
and
attendants
in
the
state
hospitals
for
the
insane
and
a
series
of
reference
books
upon
the
subject
of
insanity
the
exhibit
was
supplemented
by
a
series
of
handsome
photographs
completely
illustrating
the
various
state
hospitals
for
the
insane
the
daily
life
of
the
inmates
and
the
expert
attention
which
they
receive
glass
cases
contained
a
large
amount
of
industrial
work
done
by
the
inmates
this
chiefly
consisted
of
sewing
and
embroidery
a
feature
of
the
exhibit
was
an
oak
cabinet
containing
a
series
of
specimens
showing
cross
sections
of
the
brain
prepared
at
the
pathological
institute
in
new
york
city
it
was
of
decided
scientific
value
and
interest
near
by
was
a
miniature
tent
hospital
a
complete
model
of
the
hospital
for
the
care
of
insane
patients
afflicted
with
tuberculosis
which
is
now
in
operation
at
the
manhattan
state
hospital
ward
island
y
a
striking
feature
was
a
copy
of
the
famous
oil
painting
pinel
freeing
the
insane
at
la
salpètrière
after
the
close
of
the
french
revolution
it
most
graphically
told
the
story
of
the
complete
revolution
in
treating
this
dread
disease
state
board
of

the
exhibit
of
the
state
board
of

treatment
of

the
exhibit
of
the
board
in
the
department
for
the
care
of
juvenile
delinquents
was
comprehensive
in
its
make
up
photographs
of
the
various
state
institutions
devoted
to
this
purpose
were
shown
clearly
demonstrating
the
superiority
of
these
institutions
as
to
buildings
equipment
and
maintenance
these
photographs
were
supplemented
by
an
exhibit
of
industrial
work
of
the
inmates
the
state
industrial
school
at
rochester
and
the
house
of
refuge
for
juvenile
delinquents
at
randall
island
both
contributed
some
exceptional
work
in
wood
carving
and
wrought
iron
in
addition
to
this
were
shown
the
uniforms
worn
in
the
different
institutions
and
also
specimens
of
the
scholastic
work
which
the
children
are
doing
the
state
board
of
charities
also
assumed
the
responsibility
for
and
partially
prepared
the
exhibit
of
various
charity
organization
societies
within
the
state
by
far
the
most
elaborate
of
which
was
the
exhibit
of
the
charity
organization
society
of
new
york
city
by
means
of
photographs
administrative
blanks
and
reports
the
great
work
which
this
organization
is
doing
was
clearly
revealed
the
work
of
the
board
in
the
care
of
destitute
adults
was
demonstrated
by
means
of
a
complete
set
of
photographs
of
the
county
alms
houses
of
the
state
of
new
york
from
two
to
four
pictures
of
each
institution
were
shown
giving
a
very
clear
idea
of
their
scope
and
equipment
these
photographs
were
supplemented
by
a
statistical
blank
containing
valuable
data
as
to
the
value
of
the
plant
number
of
employees
of
inmates
and
such
other
information
as
would
be
useful
to
the
public
the
exhibit
of
the
work
of
the
board
as
related
to
general
hospitals
of
the
state
consisted
largely
of
a
series
of
photographs
supplemented
by
valuable
statistical
matter
the
board
also
prepared
an
exhibit
from
the
various
state
prisons
the
industrial
work
of
which
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
prison
commission
this
exhibit
contained
photographs
of
the
members
of
the
state
prison
commission
photographs
showing
the
interiors
of
the
different
prisons
reports
and
revealed
the
fact
that
the
empire
state
is
in
the
front
rank
in
inaugurating
reform
movements
looking
toward
the
health
safety
and
moral
uplift
of
the
inmates
state
department
of
prisons
the
exhibit
of
the
state
department
of
prisons
probably
received
as
much
attention
from
the
public
as
any
single
state
exhibit
prepared
it
consisted
of
a
demonstration
of
the
workings
of
the
bertillon
and
finger
print
systems
for
the
identification
of
criminals
an
ornate
installation
of
solid
oak
handsomely
carved
was
built
by
the
inmates
of
the
state
prison
at
ossining
and
was
carried
to
louis
and
erected
upon
the
space
assigned
to
this
department
throughout
the
season
captain
parke
an
expert
on
the
finger
print
system
and
davis
an
expert
on
the
bertillon
system
were
present
to
demonstrate
the
workings
of
these
systems
to
exposition
visitors
but
few
are
familiar
with
the
operations
of
the
bertillon
system
and
the
finger
print
system
is
as
yet
practically
unknown
new
york
state
is
the
pioneer
state
of
the
union
in
putting
into
practical
operation
the
finger
print
system
for
the
identification
of
criminals
and
it
is
the
only
state
in
which
it
is
at
present
in
use
although
there
is
a
national
bureau
of
identification
at
washington
which
is
conducted
through
the
of
the
chiefs
of
police
of
many
of
the
large
cities
throughout
the
country
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
a
department
of
the
united
states
government
and
its
system
is
far
from
as
perfect
as
that
of
the
empire
state
state
department
of
labor
probably
in
no
state
of
the
union
does
there
exist
a
labor
department
organized
upon
such
extensive
lines
as
is
that
of
the
state
of
new
york
recently
three
bureaus
were
merged
forming
the
state
department
of
labor
these
were
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
the
board
of
mediation
and
arbitration
and
the
office
of
the
factory
inspector
the
exhibit
consisted
of
a
complete
set
of
reports
of
these
various
bureaus
and
of
the
department
erected
therefrom
supplemented
with
a
series
of
graphic
charts
bearing
upon
every
phase
of
the
labor
question
and
comparing
the
economic
condition
of
the
empire
state
with
that
of
other
states
of
the
union
and
various
foreign
countries
the
exhibit
was
a
valuable
sociological
contribution
an
especially
strong
feature
was
four
monographs
entitled
typical
employers
welfare
institutions
in
new
york
labor
legislation
in
new
york
the
work
of
the
state
department
of
labor
and
the
growth
of
industry
in
new
york
these
were
printed
in
such
quantities
as
to
permit
of
their
distribution
among
visitors
to
the
exposition
the
graphic
charts
were
reproduced
in
and
inserted
in
the
monographs
the
exhibit
was
carefully
studied
by
students
of
sociology
generally
as
it
is
recognized
that
the
state
of
new
york
speaks
with
a
voice
of
authority
upon
questions
of
this
nature
state
department
of
excise
the
question
of
controlling
the
liquor
traffic
is
one
of
lively
interest
throughout
the
civilized
world
the
exhibit
of
the
state
department
of
excise
was
so
prepared
as
to
clearly
demonstrate
the
superiority
of
the
system
of
state
control
in
licensing
this
traffic
as
administered
under
the
new
york
state
liquor
tax
law
the
exhibit
consisted
of
a
series
of
graphic
charts
showing
this
statute
moral
benefit
to
the
people
of
the
state
by
reducing
the
number
of
drinking
places
more
than
twenty
per
cent
and
increasing
the
amount
collected
from
liquor
licenses
from
about
three
million
to
about
eighteen
million
dollars
annually
by
means
of
a
key
which
accompanied
the
charts
the
visitor
was
enabled
easily
to
trace
the
development
of
the
law
since
its
first
enactment
and
to
see
the
efficiency
with
which
it
is
enforced
state
department

health
the
exhibit
of
the
state
department
of

was
made
up

consisted
of
a
model
designed
to
show
the
ideal
institution
for
the
care
education
and
treatment
of
epileptics
towards
which
craig
colony
in
its
development
is
working
the
model
was
skillfully
constructed
and
cost
considerably
more
than
the
appropriation
made
by
the
commission
the
balance
being
paid
from
private
sources
