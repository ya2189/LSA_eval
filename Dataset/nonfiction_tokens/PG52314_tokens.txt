chapter
i
moving
house
i
have
been
asked
by
a
great
many
readers
of
kitchen
to
to
produce
another
book
on
the
ever
fascinating
subject
of
household
management
and
house
decoration
and
i
have
been
furthermore
requested
to
consider
edwin
and
angelina
from
another
standpoint
and
to
regard
them
as
having
increased
their
borders
in
more
ways
than
one
and
having
become
richer
and
at
the
same
time
more
numerous
as
now
beginning
to
move
from
their
small
house
furnished
so
joyfully
and
hopefully
in
the
early
flush
of
their
married
happiness
to
one
larger
in
every
way
and
more
suited
to
their
present
income
and
growing
family
i
confess
that
i
begin
my
task
with
just
a
little
diffidence
and
a
little
misgiving
too
and
feel
just
a
wee
bit
as
sad
over
the
beginning
of
this
little
volume
as
i
know
my
young
couples
must
feel
when
no
longer
quite
as
young
as
they
were
they
turn
their
backs
on
that
dear
little
first
home
and
take
up
their
abode
in
the
newer
far
more
convenient
habitation
welcomed
so
joyfully
by
the
children
who
declare
that
now
and
now
only
they
will
have
room
in
which
to
breathe
for
successful
as
kitchen
to
is
and
many
as
are
the
friends
i
have
made
through
its
pages
i
am
rather
doubtful
about
another
book
on
the
same
lines
still
i
can
but
do
my
best
and
so
without
any
more
forewords
on
the
matter
i
will
at
once
plunge
into
my
subject
and
will
trust
that
all
those
who
have
made
their
little
houses
pretty
by
either
following
or
improving
on
the
hints
given
in
my
first
book
will
not
disdain
to
follow
me
once
more
into
those
nooks
and
corners
of
and
which
were
deemed
too
ambitious
for
my
young
couple
or
were
forgotten
in
the
first
essay
on
the
subject
besides
which
as
life
goes
on
i
am
thankful
to
say
that
decoration
becomes
more
and
more
a
fine
art
formerly
people
rather
scorned
the
idea
of
being
in
the
same
manner
in
which
all
are
nowadays
their
was
merely
expressed
in
the
amount
of
gilding
compressed
into
a
single
room
in
the
thickness
of
their
carpets
the
heaviness
of
their
draperies
and
the
general
costliness
of
the
plenishing
and
the
amount
of
money
these
things
had
cost
was
far
more
often
spoken
of
than
anything
else
while
the
name
of
the
upholsterer
was
mentioned
not
as
a
guarantee
that
taste
and
skill
had
been
called
into
action
but
as
a
proof
that
money
in
this
case
had
not
been
an
object
formerly
did
i
say
alas
cases
still
exist
of
this
heavy
and
depressing
style
of
thing
money
is
poured
out
like
water
on
carpets
that
are
nightmares
and
on
papers
that
are
as
absolutely
meaningless
as
they
are
ugly
and
the
despair
of
anyone
who
is
called
in
as
i
am
constantly
to
mitigate
the
horrors
of
some
gigantic
monument
of
bad
taste
and
lavish
expenditure
and
then
too
people
are
still
as
a
rule
far
too
timid
and
act
far
too
much
in
a
hurry
they
believe
far
too
much
in
the
upholsterer
and
far
too
little
in
themselves
and
above
all
they
can
not
get
out
of
the
terrible
english
habit
carried
through
every
single
department
in
life
of
buying
a
thing
because
they
admire
it
and
not
because
it
suits
what
they
already
possess
thus
marring
at
every
step
their
chances
of
having
a
home
which
is
always
a
pleasure
to
inhabit
and
a
restful
refuge
from
the
cares
and
toils
of
life
but
it
is
to
assist
the
timid
and
those
who
lack
confidence
in
their
own
tastes
and
furthermore
who
may
live
in
distant
country
places
where
nothing
new
penetrates
even
in
these
days
of
and
illustrated
newspapers
that
i
am
writing
this
book
and
wrote
kitchen
to
garret
and
therefore
i
must
not
scold
but
rather
encourage
those
who
would
add
to
the
beauty
of
their
surroundings
but
do
not
quite
know
how
to
set
about
it
and
i
am
most
anxious
that
there
may
soon
be
no
house
anywhere
in
england
that
may
not
have
some
claim
to
be
considered
beautiful
or
interesting
or
pretty
for
indeed
there
is
no
reason
why
the
humblest
among
us
may
not
have
a
charming
home
as
certainly
if
he
or
she
have
taste
money
nowadays
is
not
a
barrier
between
beauty
and
the
public
at
large
therefore
when
any
among
my
readers
makes
up
her
mind
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
a
move
should
be
made
the
first
piece
of
advice
i
would
give
her
is
that
she
should
determine
on
her
future
locality
if
not
on
the
abode
itself
before
she
is
driven
from
her
first
house
by
the
lapsing
of
a
lease
or
the
necessity
of
deciding
immediately
because
a
tenant
is
forthcoming
for
house
number
one
for
if
not
she
may
find
herself
forced
into
an
uncongenial
neighbourhood
or
into
a
house
that
has
every
unpleasant
quality
under
the
sun
above
all
she
must
be
prepared
for
a
certain
amount
of
acute
misery
mental
at
any
rate
if
not
physical
for
there
is
something
about
first
married
home
that
one
can
never
really
replace
and
that
renders
our
fitting
into
our
new
locality
only
a
little
less
torturing
than
inhabiting
a
new
skin
would
be
were
we
suddenly
forced
into
one
personally
i
am
not
one
bit
sentimental
i
never
cried
over
a
faded
flower
or
lay
awake
weeping
bitter
tears
over
an
unhappy
i
never
had
one
i
am
thankful
to
say
neither
have
i
hoarded
first
shoes
snippings
of
baby
curls
nor
indeed
anything
save
my
which
is
a
most
valuable
for
characters
and
private
theatricals
of
all
kinds
and
therefore
i
am
considered
absolutely
lacking
in
feelings
and
unhampered
by
but
i
have
never
yet
become
reconciled
to
the
moves
we
have
had
to
make
after
our
first
twelve
years
of
married
life
and
i
much
doubt
now
if
i
ever
shall
i
certainly
shall
not
until
i
make
move
number
three
and
what
is
perhaps
the
most
curious
point
in
the
whole
business
is
that
i
did
not
like
the
house
nor
the
town
nor
indeed
anything
much
about
it
and
yet
i
can
never
see
certain
looks
in
the
sky
scent
certain
odours
without
being
transported
to
dear
dull
dorsetshire
and
without
longing
in
a
curious
way
for
the
marvellously
lovely
range
of
the
purbeck
hills
which
haunts
me
like
a
dream
and
for
which
i
am
convinced
i
should
positively
pine
had
i
the
smallest
touch
of
sentiment
in
my
composition
the
house
itself
was
most
wretchedly
inconvenient
the
furniture
of
over
twenty
years
ago
aye
and
some
of
it
over
fifty
years
ago
does
not
bear
thinking
about
in
these
Ã¦sthetic
days
i
endured
dullness
such
as
only
a
london
girl
plunged
suddenly
into
an
atmosphere
she
could
not
comprehend
much
less
assimilate
could
experience
we
had
three
years
of
unspeakable
worries
and
yet
with
it
all
with
its
hideous
rooms
and
its
cold
and
ugly
passages
its
and
its
unpleasant
associations
there
is
something
about
it
that
no
other
house
can
ever
hold
and
that
causes
me
often
and
often
to
dream
i
am
there
again
or
that
makes
me
hear
sometimes
on
a
quiet
night
the
old
sound
of
the
sudden
clash
of
the
china
closet
door
the
opening
of
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
which
i
believe
has
been
taken
away
now
by
desecrating
hands
and
which
had
a
sound
all
its
own
or
that
causes
me
to
wake
suddenly
from
sleep
to
wonder
at
the
late
return
of
phantom
waggons
and
ghostly
horses
over
stones
that
are
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
our
present
uncongenial
abode
and
which
caused
sounds
inseparable
from
thoughts
of
those
dear
dead
days
days
i
would
have
back
this
moment
if
i
could
if
only
to
live
them
over
once
more
in
a
manner
a
thousand
times
better
than
an
inexperienced
girl
could
ever
do
and
use
then
the
experience
one
buys
at
such
an
enormous
cost
because
one
will
not
listen
to
words
of
wisdom
from
those
who
have
lived
so
very
much
longer
in
the
world
than
we
had
then
and
which
is
useless
now
because
one
sees
all
too
late
what
one
might
have
done
for
others
these
experiences
and
reminiscences
of
mine
may
seem
out
of
place
here
but
they
really
are
not
i
shall
in
this
book
as
in
my
last
speak
only
of
what
i
have
experienced
and
i
am
so
convinced
that
when
is
done
heartbreak
must
ensue
that
i
dwell
upon
this
aspect
of
the
case
in
order
that
the
first
house
may
not
be
left
capriciously
but
only
because
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
go
elsewhere
i
have
always
felt
myself
unsentimental
creature
though
i
am
that
a
house
absorbs
some
of
own
personality
that
the
very
walls
we
warm
with
our
breathing
living
selves
and
among
which
we
spend
our
lives
and
allow
ourselves
to
be
ourselves
without
any
company
veneer
must
in
some
measure
become
impregnated
by
our
vitality
you
may
for
example
and
your
room
but
in
a
very
short
time
that
room
looks
exactly
like
you
once
more
and
becomes
again
in
a
week
or
two
a
month
at
most
part
and
parcel
of
your
own
individuality
but
leave
your
house
and
if
you
can
muster
sufficient
courage
to
do
so
go
and
call
on
the
next
inhabitant
and
you
will
see
in
one
moment
what
i
mean
the
very
room
is
altered
your
successors
may
have
kept
your
decorations
taken
off
your
and
gone
on
the
very
same
lines
as
regards
furnishing
and
arrangement
as
you
did
but
it
will
not
look
in
the
very
least
like
you
and
you
will
not
believe
you
are
in
the
same
room
in
which
you
have
spent
so
many
happy
and
unhappy
hours
at
first
therefore
in
any
new
house
you
have
not
only
to
adapt
yourself
and
your
furniture
to
it
but
you
have
by
your
individuality
to
imprint
yourself
on
the
very
fabric
itself
the
last
individuality
fades
at
once
i
have
seen
few
empty
houses
that
do
not
look
precisely
like
something
dead
the
body
is
there
but
the
spirit
is
absent
and
there
is
a
blank
awful
chill
about
such
a
house
that
penetrates
very
soul
and
depresses
one
in
an
extraordinary
way
but
it
takes
some
time
to
reanimate
the
body
and
indeed
in
an
unloved
atmosphere
i
question
if
it
is
ever
done
some
folk
the
house
have
at
any
price
and
there
are
one
or
two
places
i
wot
of
that
are
blank
still
because
uncongenial
people
have
them
and
are
incapable
of
living
up
to
them
properly
they
put
just
the
wrong
draperies
in
the
windows
wrench
the
doors
round
into
the
wrong
places
and
finally
have
hung
the
very
worst
colours
on
the
walls
and
indeed
have
treated
it
in
such
an
inconsiderate
way
that
it
never
responds
and
remains
silent
angular
unsatisfied
dead
as
long
as
those
people
remain
within
its
shelter
angelina
when
she
really
must
move
therefore
must
remember
to
think
over
all
these
details
i
envy
everyone
myself
who
has
a
really
inherited
house
a
house
which
has
absorbed
the
family
atmosphere
for
centuries
that
has
never
been
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
from
family
to
family
until
it
has
no
recollection
of
who
built
it
or
what
it
was
built
for
a
house
for
which
it
is
an
intense
and
real
pleasure
to
plan
improvements
to
deck
as
one
would
deck
a
child
of
own
knowing
that
what
we
spent
on
it
or
did
for
it
would
benefit
and
please
not
only
ourselves
but
those
who
are
to
come
after
us
yes
hopeless
radical
as
i
am
in
everything
else
i
am
conservative
indeed
in
the
house
i
would
have
if
i
could
but
in
these
days
of
progress
when
most
people
grow
rich
and
many
only
use
their
as
a
shelter
and
think
of
it
as
a
home
i
am
constantly
being
pained
to
see
retired
city
men
and
lawyers
the
two
classes
which
become
really
wealthy
taking
over
the
delightful
places
which
once
owned
families
and
ruining
the
society
round
with
their
ostentation
and
the
ridiculous
airs
only
found
in
suburban
places
where
consists
of
looking
down
on
twopence
while
the
poor
houses
themselves
are
ruined
too
by
utterly
inappropriate
furnishing
and
by
decorations
suitable
only
for
an
ordinary
furnished
by
giving
to
some
enterprising
and
advertising
tradesman
should
angelina
have
made
her
first
home
in
the
family
she
will
never
have
to
learn
what
moving
house
really
means
she
can
allow
her
roots
to
sink
as
deeply
as
she
likes
into
the
kindly
soil
and
she
can
make
it
all
as
charming
as
she
will
because
she
will
know
that
all
she
does
will
only
benefit
her
own
but
as
there
are
indeed
few
nowadays
who
can
contemplate
this
for
even
the
absorbers
of
the
old
places
round
london
never
think
of
the
generation
behind
them
and
often
and
often
cut
up
the
land
for
eligible
building
sites
with
as
little
compunction
as
one
cuts
up
a
cake
at
a
only
taking
care
it
shall
go
as
far
as
it
can
we
need
not
dwell
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
but
on
the
one
that
should
be
the
motive
of
this
chapter
namely
moving
house
if
you
are
tolerably
happy
in
the
neighbourhood
you
know
pray
take
my
advice
and
remain
there
there
are
sure
to
be
discomforts
of
some
kind
or
other
in
any
locality
i
have
never
yet
come
across
anyone
who
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
or
her
belongings
certainly
i
have
never
met
anyone
who
had
not
bitter
complaint
to
make
about
the
special
locality
he
or
she
inhabited
and
yet
who
did
not
ruffle
up
their
feathers
the
moment
any
stranger
found
fault
with
it
but
a
neighbourhood
is
like
a
house
and
requires
locally
knowing
and
if
we
are
for
ever
changing
our
neighbourhood
we
can
never
feel
at
home
anywhere
no
doubt
it
is
an
unfashionable
idea
nowadays
this
clinging
to
one
place
but
i
think
if
more
consideration
were
given
to
the
subject
life
would
be
much
better
than
it
is
at
present
for
far
more
good
can
be
done
by
those
who
are
able
to
help
their
poorer
neighbours
should
they
remain
year
after
year
in
the
same
place
for
they
are
thus
enabled
to
know
them
thoroughly
to
sift
the
deserving
from
the
hopeless
and
finally
to
interest
themselves
in
such
a
way
in
the
real
life
around
them
that
the
place
in
which
fate
has
placed
them
is
in
some
measure
better
for
their
having
made
their
home
there
and
this
can
not
be
done
satisfactorily
by
mere
birds
of
passage
who
have
no
in
the
place
and
are
ready
to
be
off
at
a
notice
just
because
they
think
a
change
would
be
nice
and
once
having
made
up
your
minds
that
a
change
of
house
is
imperative
i
advise
you
to
ponder
seriously
and
at
great
length
over
the
pros
and
cons
of
a
residence
in
the
same
neighbourhood
before
finally
determining
to
plant
your
roots
elsewhere
i
think
what
makes
a
residence
in
the
suburbs
almost
unendurable
is
this
mania
for
change
for
we
no
sooner
begin
to
know
people
there
and
like
them
than
we
find
they
are
becoming
uneasy
they
fancy
the
place
is
unhealthy
someone
has
been
rude
the
nicest
people
have
not
called
as
if
the
nicest
people
ever
did
rush
to
call
without
introductions
of
some
sort
or
other
and
they
are
off
impatiently
before
they
have
entered
into
the
life
of
a
place
they
condemn
ruthlessly
because
they
do
not
really
know
what
it
is
like
how
long
does
it
take
to
know
a
place
well
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
go
there
with
really
good
introductions
i
should
think
six
months
if
you
know
no
one
and
are
dependent
on
chance
or
the
vicar
of
the
parish
you
may
never
know
it
at
all
but
in
ordinary
cases
and
where
people
have
had
their
edges
clipped
by
really
good
society
you
ought
to
know
quite
as
many
people
as
you
wish
to
in
about
three
years
therefore
if
you
have
begun
your
residence
in
the
suburbs
and
have
a
nice
church
a
nice
doctor
and
nice
friends
stay
there
you
know
how
deeply
your
roots
are
planted
until
you
begin
to
drag
them
up
if
you
are
a
londoner
on
no
account
be
persuaded
by
artistic
accounts
of
country
delights
to
leave
your
beloved
pavements
and
the
exquisite
freedom
of
a
town
life
and
surroundings
and
if
you
are
born
and
have
lived
among
cabbages
and
roses
if
you
love
the
country
and
can
interest
yourself
mildly
in
the
continual
changes
that
are
going
on
around
you
in
your
houses
and
the
cottages
round
about
remain
there
and
be
thankful
for
tastes
which
are
innocent
if
they
are
circumscribed
and
often
result
in
a
far
nobler
life
than
that
made
up
mostly
from
excitement
and
dissipation
because
anyone
who
can
and
will
live
cheerfully
in
the
country
making
work
for
the
labourer
and
employing
folk
in
pure
air
and
in
decent
habitations
does
much
more
for
the
human
race
than
he
wots
of
and
should
be
encouraged
to
do
so
in
any
manner
that
one
possibly
can
i
am
often
being
told
that
the
country
is
a
far
cheaper
place
to
live
in
than
london
but
i
have
tried
both
and
i
know
better
in
the
first
place
in
london
you
can
do
precisely
what
you
like
and
provided
your
likes
are
not
openly
eccentric
no
one
will
interfere
with
you
you
can
have
ten
friends
or
ten
thousand
acquaintances
you
may
wear
one
dress
as
long
as
it
will
hold
together
and
no
one
will
doubt
your
capabilities
of
being
respectable
because
of
your
shabby
attire
you
may
get
up
when
you
like
go
to
bed
when
you
like
need
not
give
to
any
charity
if
you
are
not
charitably
disposed
need
not
keep
a
carriage
because
you
can
at
any
moment
hail
any
vehicle
and
go
anywhere
you
like
and
above
all
can
be
so
easily
amused
and
at
so
cheap
a
rate
that
one
need
hardly
put
down
in
our
schedule
at
all
now
in
the
country
we
must
have
some
sort
of
a
carriage
if
we
wish
to
get
outside
our
own
immediate
neighbourhood
and
mix
with
our
from
the
humble
of
the
wife
and
the
to
the
landau
waggonette
or
smart
little
victoria
of
the
other
richer
folk
all
must
have
some
other
means
of
progression
than
would
be
afforded
by
own
legs
our
incomes
are
common
property
and
should
we
have
two
new
dresses
in
the
course
of
the
year
are
a
prey
for
all
those
dear
creatures
who
spend
their
time
in
being
charitable
on
other
money
we
must
have
a
garden
and
we
obtain
a
scant
supply
of
fruit
inferior
flowers
and
vegetables
at
a
price
for
which
we
could
have
obtained
the
very
best
stores
of
covent
garden
for
by
i
mean
that
our
pears
and
asparagus
come
before
their
time
but
considerably
after
the
period
when
they
have
become
cheap
in
the
market
in
london
and
finally
we
can
not
be
amused
without
half
ruining
ourselves
by
constant
rushes
to
town
by
subscribing
largely
to
mudie
and
by
taking
in
every
newspaper
we
can
lay
our
hands
on
if
we
are
readers
and
if
we
are
fond
of
finery
by
sending
for
constant
new
garments
not
because
we
want
them
but
because
we
really
want
to
see
what
is
being
worn
of
course
rates
rents
and
taxes
are
much
less
in
the
country
but
rent
in
london
is
less
than
it
used
to
be
and
in
unfashionable
neighbourhoods
is
not
too
exorbitant
but
even
with
the
rent
considered
i
still
maintain
one
can
live
more
cheaply
in
london
than
elsewhere
and
can
most
certainly
live
longer
there
and
far
more
pleasantly
so
i
do
most
strongly
advise
country
mice
to
remain
country
mice
unless
they
make
the
change
very
young
and
i
implore
town
mice
to
cling
to
their
pavements
for
nothing
short
of
a
residence
for
generations
in
the
country
can
teach
one
how
to
live
under
the
microscope
which
is
put
over
one
the
moment
a
stranger
goes
into
the
country
to
live
and
nothing
save
being
born
to
it
could
ever
reconcile
one
to
having
most
intimate
personal
concerns
discussed
at
the
bar
of
every
public
house
over
every
shop
counter
in
every
parlour
as
they
are
discussed
in
an
ordinary
rural
place
or
to
having
most
innocent
speeches
repeated
until
one
would
certainly
not
recognise
them
did
they
return
to
us
after
their
last
repetition
i
declare
that
twenty
years
of
residence
in
and
about
the
country
have
never
reconciled
me
to
all
this
or
caused
me
to
take
the
profound
interest
in
my
turn
in
my
neighbours
in
the
way
that
aborigines
do
to
reconcile
and
repay
themselves
for
their
own
sojourn
under
the
microscope
and
which
a
country
born
and
bred
individual
takes
as
naturally
as
he
does
his
absence
from
the
theatres
and
his
utter
lack
of
interest
on
any
other
topic
than
the
one
of
is
going
to
marry
whom
or
who
is
not
and
what
the
last
baby
was
called
and
why
that
special
name
was
selected
and
therefore
i
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
warning
the
ducks
to
remain
in
the
pond
and
the
hens
in
the
farmyard
where
they
were
hatched
for
i
am
quite
sure
my
experience
is
not
a
solitary
one
by
any
means
and
has
often
been
the
fate
of
those
who
went
into
the
country
because
no
one
warned
them
that
the
delights
thereof
were
mere
snares
and
delusions
and
who
would
give
anything
to
return
only
they
can
not
afford
another
move
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
country
mice
are
as
miserable
in
the
town
in
their
turn
they
miss
the
intimate
conversations
the
familiarity
of
their
friendships
they
pine
for
fresh
air
and
weep
over
the
noise
and
bustle
we
love
so
dearly
bewilders
and
distresses
them
they
object
to
putting
on
gloves
and
a
bonnet
whenever
they
go
out
resent
being
unable
to
at
any
moment
to
their
acquaintances
dread
the
streets
see
disease
lurking
at
every
corner
in
every
glass
of
milk
in
each
vestment
fresh
from
the
laundress
and
pining
away
become
pale
ill
and
wretched
and
put
it
down
to
london
when
really
the
misery
lies
entirely
in
themselves
have
i
said
enough
to
show
my
readers
that
when
they
are
contemplating
a
move
they
should
do
their
utmost
to
remain
in
the
same
neighbourhood
or
at
all
events
in
one
with
the
main
workings
of
which
they
are
in
a
measure
familiar
i
think
so
and
if
at
the
same
time
i
tell
them
to
remember
the
church
where
their
children
were
christened
the
doctor
who
helped
them
over
so
many
hours
of
pain
and
trouble
and
finally
the
friends
they
made
and
old
friends
should
never
be
given
up
on
any
account
whatever
i
believe
they
will
see
that
a
change
even
for
the
better
has
always
its
trials
and
that
a
great
many
things
should
be
considered
before
takes
place
and
a
family
is
landed
in
an
entirely
new
locality
that
be
it
as
nice
as
it
may
be
has
its
own
interests
in
which
the
has
neither
part
nor
parcel
and
its
unwritten
laws
and
small
rules
of
etiquette
which
are
as
rigid
as
they
are
incomprehensible
to
an
outsider
i
think
in
every
neighbourhood
there
should
be
also
some
agent
to
send
out
lists
of
all
the
pros
and
cons
the
ins
and
outs
of
a
neighbourhood
which
should
show
you
at
once
the
number
and
styles
of
the
different
churches
the
state
of
society
it
could
be
or
anything
almost
the
schools
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
in
fact
all
the
particulars
one
wants
to
know
they
should
truthfully
and
in
confidence
give
one
all
the
required
information
and
then
one
would
not
run
the
risk
of
making
mistakes
but
as
this
seems
impossible
a
residence
for
a
short
time
in
a
furnished
house
own
house
could
in
turn
be
let
to
some
one
who
wants
to
investigate
our
neighbourhood
should
be
indulged
in
a
very
few
weeks
would
inform
us
of
all
we
want
to
know
for
even
if
we
did
not
become
acquainted
with
one
soul
personally
we
should
have
looked
at
the
people
and
taken
stock
of
their
windows
from
which
i
think
one
can
always
learn
so
much
and
can
quietly
make
our
own
inquiries
about
schools
churches
and
the
rest
of
the
vital
points
of
interest
about
a
new
residence
and
come
as
quietly
to
the
conclusion
as
to
whether
the
neighbourhood
will
suit
us
or
not
before
going
to
the
expense
of
moving
and
decorating
to
suit
ourselves
and
our
belongings
an
expense
which
once
incurred
often
binds
us
hard
and
fast
to
a
place
from
which
we
would
give
our
ears
to
remove
then
comes
the
question
of
the
house
this
should
be
large
enough
to
take
all
the
family
and
allow
for
any
possible
additions
but
at
the
same
time
angelina
will
have
to
remember
that
when
the
boys
are
at
school
there
will
always
be
a
room
for
a
friend
and
therefore
the
question
of
spare
rooms
is
not
such
a
vital
one
as
it
was
she
will
also
have
to
legislate
for
the
own
room
probably
a
room
for
a
governess
though
a
resident
governess
should
be
avoided
unless
the
house
is
a
good
size
and
unless
she
is
an
absolute
necessity
there
is
the
schoolroom
to
think
of
and
she
must
contemplate
perhaps
ruefully
the
nurseries
with
an
eye
to
adapting
them
to
another
purpose
when
that
saddest
of
all
days
comes
when
we
can
not
deceive
ourselves
into
believing
a
nursery
is
any
longer
necessary
and
we
have
to
turn
our
backs
on
our
youth
and
the
dear
small
at
the
same
time
a
house
without
a
nursery
is
never
as
joyous
or
lively
as
one
that
possesses
such
a
room
and
no
use
trying
to
believe
this
to
be
the
case
still
it
is
equally
of
no
use
to
set
apart
the
best
room
in
the
house
for
that
most
pleasant
of
all
chambers
if
there
is
no
chance
of
nursery
children
and
if
all
are
merged
into
the
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
are
fast
growing
up
and
eagerly
longing
to
launch
their
boats
on
the
sea
of
life
for
a
cruise
of
their
own
when
the
house
is
positively
and
actually
selected
and
the
move
imminent
when
the
lease
is
signed
and
the
decorations
are
in
train
the
first
step
to
take
is
to
get
several
estimates
from
firms
who
are
accustomed
to
do
nothing
else
save
move
furniture
in
nothing
does
price
fluctuate
so
much
as
it
does
in
these
estimates
and
when
we
moved
from
dorsetshire
to
shortlands
there
was
actually
and
positively
a
difference
of
in
the
highest
and
lowest
of
the
many
estimates
we
had
the
person
selected
being
just
lower
in
his
price
than
the
man
who
made
us
our
first
offer
to
move
luxuriously
we
should
have
taken
house
number
two
for
a
quarter
before
we
are
obliged
to
leave
our
own
of
course
if
we
could
persuade
the
landlord
to
let
us
have
it
for
six
weeks
it
would
be
better
but
not
many
landlords
are
as
accommodating
as
this
and
unfortunately
many
of
us
can
not
afford
a
double
rent
even
for
such
a
short
space
of
time
still
an
effort
should
be
made
as
undoubtedly
much
is
wasted
in
a
hurried
move
in
an
enforced
turning
out
on
quarter
day
into
another
house
on
the
same
date
it
is
only
people
in
very
straitened
circumstances
who
accept
in
these
artistic
days
of
ours
the
scheme
of
decoration
formerly
there
were
no
ideas
in
the
head
of
an
ordinary
paterfamilias
on
the
subject
of
paint
and
paper
and
as
long
as
all
was
clean
and
in
good
condition
he
did
not
agitate
himself
in
the
least
about
his
surroundings
as
far
as
mere
colour
and
were
concerned
and
he
cheerfully
spread
his
turkey
carpet
and
placed
his
heavy
sideboard
and
mahogany
table
and
chairs
in
position
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
flock
paper
and
vulgar
graining
made
up
a
as
utterly
depressing
as
it
was
tasteless
and
absolutely
without
character
but
now
i
am
glad
to
think
what
is
already
in
possession
governs
in
some
measure
what
alterations
are
to
be
made
and
as
fate
never
yet
was
so
propitious
as
to
put
one
down
straight
from
one
house
into
another
which
was
exactly
decorated
to
our
taste
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
there
are
many
things
to
do
to
any
place
to
which
we
may
contemplate
moving
therefore
i
say
if
possible
let
the
two
leases
of
your
present
and
your
future
house
run
side
by
side
for
six
weeks
at
least
so
shall
you
move
comfortably
and
be
able
to
make
those
alterations
that
are
perfectly
sure
to
be
necessary
a
new
house
should
never
by
any
chance
be
entered
in
the
september
quarter
it
is
astonishing
what
an
amount
of
coal
and
reckless
expenditure
of
gas
is
required
to
obtain
even
moderate
warmth
in
a
new
house
and
furthermore
most
appalling
discoveries
are
apt
to
be
made
as
soon
as
the
fires
are
lighted
of
the
manner
in
which
floors
doors
and
are
capable
of
shrinking
the
moment
warmth
penetrates
the
place
these
we
can
circumvent
in
summer
but
the
winter
is
not
a
time
to
run
any
risks
of
discovering
that
the
more
we
try
to
warm
the
house
the
wider
open
gape
the
cracks
in
all
the
woodwork
and
that
nothing
we
can
do
will
really
warm
a
place
more
and
more
exposed
as
days
go
by
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
therefore
if
the
future
house
has
never
been
lived
in
enter
it
in
june
or
even
in
march
there
will
then
be
ample
time
to
find
out
all
faults
in
the
structure
before
the
winter
arrives
with
all
its
concomitant
miseries
delightful
aspinall
for
whose
existence
i
can
never
be
sufficiently
thankful
has
made
house
decoration
mere
play
compared
to
what
it
used
to
be
and
armed
with
his
paints
and
a
written
description
of
what
each
room
is
to
be
like
when
done
the
foreman
can
be
left
to
his
own
devices
and
the
old
house
can
be
returned
to
with
a
safe
conscience
for
if
careful
selection
has
been
made
of
each
paper
and
its
own
particular
paint
no
risks
are
run
of
finding
as
i
found
when
i
made
my
last
move
that
owing
to
the
peculiar
freaks
of
the
painter
there
were
seven
shades
of
blue
in
my
hall
and
another
separate
shade
of
the
same
colour
in
a
that
was
designed
for
a
gem
and
was
becoming
under
the
brush
the
exact
shade
of
a
apron
which
was
his
own
idea
of
a
complete
match
to
the
paper
really
a
good
egg
if
only
he
had
had
neat
little
tins
i
should
not
have
had
to
stand
over
him
all
the
time
he
mixed
his
paint
and
most
of
the
time
he
was
applying
it
and
could
not
see
at
the
last
that
he
was
wrong
and
i
was
absolutely
right
so
if
those
about
to
move
will
leave
their
decorators
instructions
to
use
aspinall
and
nothing
else
they
can
be
absolutely
sure
that
their
paint
will
be
right
and
not
a
perpetual
eyesore
as
it
almost
invariably
is
when
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
ordinary
decorator
who
considers
he
has
an
eye
for
colour
and
is
as
obstinate
as
people
invariably
are
briefly
then
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
when
we
contemplate
moving
is
to
really
make
up
our
minds
that
such
a
step
is
absolutely
necessary
because
no
one
who
has
never
moved
can
understand
the
mental
misery
caused
by
tearing
up
roots
even
from
an
uncongenial
soil
secondly
to
carefully
select
a
house
likely
to
be
our
home
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
thirdly
to
still
more
carefully
choose
and
put
in
train
a
scheme
of
decoration
that
will
harmonise
in
some
measure
with
our
cherished
possessions
and
fourthly
to
endeavour
not
to
be
forced
at
the
last
to
move
hurriedly
or
into
a
new
house
in
the
winter
once
these
details
are
remembered
and
enforced
the
real
process
of
moving
may
begin
and
be
got
over
as
soon
as
the
new
house
is
ready
for
the
inmates
the
mere
move
itself
should
be
left
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
people
employed
personally
i
recommend
for
any
one
in
the
suburbs
bachelar
of
croydon
who
moved
our
furniture
most
successfully
in
the
south
of
england
peace
of
bridgewater
and
bournemouth
is
equally
to
be
commended
unfortunately
i
know
no
one
in
the
north
but
i
have
no
doubt
there
are
many
firms
there
but
in
any
case
all
should
be
written
to
and
estimates
should
be
carefully
considered
before
definitely
selecting
any
one
from
among
their
number
but
all
belongings
should
be
in
covered
furniture
vans
open
vans
or
railway
trucks
are
ruination
and
should
never
for
one
moment
be
used
and
no
estimate
which
includes
moving
any
of
the
and
in
open
trucks
should
be
considered
seriously
as
even
the
roughest
furniture
suffers
considerably
by
being
carted
about
in
this
primitive
manner
and
is
spoiled
to
a
far
greater
extent
than
the
mere
difference
between
the
two
kinds
of
conveyances
would
pay
for
the
books
and
pictures
should
be
packed
first
and
unpacked
last
the
carpets
should
be
rolled
up
after
a
good
shaking
with
inside
even
for
the
shortest
transit
the
straw
used
in
packing
them
in
the
most
carefully
supervised
vans
having
been
proved
a
most
comfortable
home
for
small
and
teasing
animals
which
discovering
that
carpets
pillows
and
beds
are
warmer
and
more
comfortable
on
the
whole
than
straw
forsake
their
habitations
for
eligible
residences
among
our
properties
if
we
have
not
made
them
unbearable
with
camphor
and
a
good
sprinkling
of
insect
powder
before
they
leave
our
hands
each
of
furniture
should
be
placed
ready
to
be
again
put
down
in
the
special
room
for
which
it
is
intended
the
carpets
should
remain
rolled
until
the
last
of
the
movers
is
departed
then
after
the
floors
have
been
most
thoroughly
scrubbed
with
carbolic
soap
the
carpets
should
be
well
beaten
and
should
be
relaid
if
possible
by
the
hands
of
some
for
on
the
proper
laying
of
a
carpet
depends
far
more
of
the
wear
than
we
quite
realise
the
best
furniture
mover
can
not
resist
please
remember
this
the
exquisite
temptation
to
which
he
is
exposed
to
stuff
up
odd
corners
and
to
prevent
shaking
by
making
out
of
our
pillows
cushions
and
odds
and
ends
generally
and
as
he
furthermore
has
most
excellent
wrapping
material
in
blankets
small
rugs
and
other
similar
trifles
the
amateur
must
come
to
the
rescue
of
her
goods
or
the
professional
packer
will
be
much
too
strong
for
her
in
really
and
households
each
bed
pillow
and
mattress
should
have
its
loose
and
washable
cover
sewn
tightly
over
it
of
crash
these
covers
should
be
washed
every
year
if
possible
every
six
months
and
if
these
are
arranged
for
they
will
in
a
great
measure
protect
our
property
from
the
dirt
and
certain
amount
of
almost
indispensable
damage
which
would
accrue
to
them
were
they
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
remover
who
would
at
once
use
them
as
mentioned
above
and
would
not
disdain
to
walk
upon
them
cheerfully
did
they
seem
to
require
more
pressing
down
than
a
mere
arrangement
with
the
hands
would
effect
but
if
they
are
not
so
defended
before
the
move
is
actually
in
progress
these
covers
should
be
made
or
else
great
sheets
of
coarse
crash
such
as
is
used
for
packing
purposes
should
be
strongly
sewn
round
them
or
inevitably
we
shall
have
to
send
all
the
bedding
to
the
upholsterers
to
be
picked
over
and
readjusted
and
the
ticks
washed
also
the
blankets
must
be
even
more
carefully
protected
i
have
seen
them
wrapped
round
iron
bedsteads
and
large
mirrors
and
with
boots
and
even
knives
inside
their
folds
and
in
any
case
they
are
ruthlessly
annexed
for
packing
purposes
now
to
circumvent
this
i
strongly
advise
that
space
should
be
left
at
the
top
of
the
box
of
each
person
inhabiting
each
separate
room
and
into
this
space
the
folded
blankets
should
go
to
be
ready
for
use
at
once
and
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
the
clothes
that
should
have
occupied
the
space
in
the
box
can
be
most
safely
left
in
the
chests
of
drawers
and
wardrobes
for
of
all
kinds
is
invariably
respected
and
not
the
most
ruthless
of
packers
would
dream
of
enfolding
grimy
objects
in
body
linen
or
even
among
the
folds
of
heavy
winter
dresses
these
are
invariably
left
exactly
as
one
last
placed
them
and
are
emphatically
respected
while
even
new
blankets
appear
to
have
an
irresistible
attraction
for
them
and
are
annexed
at
once
while
venerable
ones
suffer
in
the
most
appalling
way
conceivable
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
move
in
anything
like
comfort
or
peace
unless
the
juvenile
members
of
the
family
and
their
nurses
are
it
is
astonishing
how
very
kind
people
are
to
each
other
when
this
trying
work
is
proceeding
and
there
are
few
among
us
if
indeed
there
are
any
who
are
not
possessed
of
relatives
or
at
least
dear
friends
who
will
stretch
their
houses
to
the
extent
of
taking
in
some
of
the
children
for
the
inside
of
a
week
but
if
there
are
none
on
whom
we
can
rely
the
children
should
be
sent
to
an
hotel
or
lodgings
should
be
taken
for
them
for
a
week
for
if
this
is
not
done
we
should
be
quite
sure
to
be
driven
mad
by
them
by
the
utter
helplessness
of
their
nurses
and
by
the
certainty
that
we
should
have
them
all
ill
from
the
draughts
the
scrappy
meals
the
uncertain
hours
and
the
thousand
and
one
absolutely
unpreventable
events
that
are
familiar
to
every
mother
and
therefore
need
not
be
detailed
here
let
us
suppose
therefore
that
our
move
is
to
commence
on
a
tuesday
an
excellent
day
which
leaves
monday
for
our
private
packings
for
the
men
to
pack
the
books
china
and
ornaments
the
number
of
my
possessions
in
these
several
ways
always
eliciting
most
amusing
comments
and
for
us
to
clear
out
the
children
and
nurses
these
latter
by
the
way
should
have
carefully
packed
all
the
things
the
week
before
in
boxes
marked
in
large
chalk
letters
and
should
take
with
them
to
their
lodgings
only
what
is
absolutely
necessary
we
will
then
proceed
put
all
the
blankets
away
as
suggested
just
now
see
our
garments
are
so
bestowed
that
they
are
safe
the
silver
and
jewellery
in
the
charge
of
the
if
there
be
one
in
the
charge
of
the
if
there
be
none
and
then
we
should
see
placards
are
up
in
each
room
inscribed
with
the
name
of
the
room
into
which
the
things
are
to
go
and
our
task
at
the
other
end
will
be
much
simplified
if
we
also
attach
labels
to
each
very
heavy
piece
of
furniture
taking
care
similar
labels
are
already
placed
in
a
prominent
position
in
the
rooms
they
are
intended
for
the
packing
of
a
big
house
takes
about
two
days
and
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
two
of
the
servants
and
one
of
the
household
the
eldest
daughter
if
possible
should
go
on
to
the
new
house
if
however
there
is
a
long
journey
before
them
they
should
start
almost
as
soon
as
the
vans
come
as
the
first
will
arrive
wednesday
morning
at
the
new
abode
and
someone
should
be
there
to
receive
it
the
mistress
and
master
should
remain
until
wednesday
night
when
they
too
should
go
on
to
the
new
abode
travelling
by
night
if
necessary
and
the
oldest
and
trustworthiest
servant
should
be
left
to
see
the
house
is
cleaned
down
by
a
couple
of
charwomen
and
to
hand
the
keys
to
a
representative
of
the
landlord
who
should
go
over
the
house
with
an
agent
on
the
side
of
the
remover
to
see
all
was
left
properly
and
undamaged
by
the
tenant
then
the
maid
or
man
could
rest
at
a
house
or
at
the
local
inn
and
join
the
rest
of
the
party
on
thursday
morning
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
a
separate
hamper
of
food
ready
cooked
and
sufficient
to
supply
the
household
for
three
days
should
be
sent
on
with
the
first
batch
of
domestics
and
the
hamper
should
contain
kettle
cups
and
saucers
plates
and
knives
and
forks
besides
the
actual
food
the
cook
will
not
be
able
to
be
spared
from
putting
her
belongings
in
order
to
cook
eatables
but
an
ample
supply
is
necessary
for
as
all
will
be
working
hard
all
will
require
sustenance
this
hamper
should
be
at
once
put
into
the
larder
in
the
new
house
the
door
locked
and
the
key
kept
by
the
servant
herself
the
contents
of
the
bedrooms
the
kitchen
and
one
and
if
possible
one
bedroom
besides
should
be
despatched
first
and
as
each
article
is
brought
in
someone
should
seat
herself
on
a
in
the
hall
and
should
call
out
bedroom
room
or
otherwise
name
its
destination
so
will
the
movers
avoid
the
pleasing
sight
that
met
my
eyes
when
i
moved
last
of
the
complete
contents
of
three
rooms
placed
in
the
centre
of
one
chamber
heaped
up
like
in
vallombrosa
where
the
wretched
painters
were
dawdling
over
their
work
still
the
painters
who
had
caused
this
chaos
by
insisting
that
none
of
the
other
rooms
were
ready
though
none
were
as
absolutely
unfinished
as
that
in
which
they
had
arranged
this
pleasing
reception
for
me
thank
goodness
my
rage
was
so
extreme
that
i
turned
them
out
neck
and
crop
else
verily
i
believe
they
would
be
here
at
this
very
moment
but
i
always
determined
to
use
my
own
sufferings
as
a
warning
to
others
and
i
relate
this
experience
in
the
hope
that
no
one
will
attempt
a
move
until
the
painters
are
out
and
unless
they
will
manage
it
on
the
lines
here
laid
down
for
them
the
men
who
move
are
always
supposed
to
lay
carpets
hang
pictures
and
curtains
and
replace
the
books
in
cases
whenever
money
is
a
very
great
object
and
in
that
case
no
move
should
be
contemplated
unless
it
were
a
matter
of
health
or
the
change
of
employment
i
strongly
advise
that
they
should
do
nothing
of
the
kind
in
the
first
place
the
carpets
should
not
be
placed
until
the
last
man
has
departed
and
in
the
second
it
is
infinitely
better
to
have
not
only
a
regular
but
a
man
accustomed
to
hang
pictures
and
arrange
brackets
mirrors
i
personally
have
a
great
many
pictures
and
odds
and
ends
and
i
have
twice
had
a
most
excellent
man
from
on
these
occasions
who
came
properly
provided
with
nails
and
all
necessary
tools
and
who
for
a
little
under
quietly
swiftly
and
skilfully
placed
the
pictures
in
their
places
with
just
a
very
little
supervision
from
me
for
like
all
those
who
have
no
regular
art
education
he
had
the
usual
mania
for
hanging
everything
ever
so
much
higher
than
it
ought
to
be
a
mania
i
most
successfully
and
promptly
combated
but
beyond
this
and
giving
him
a
few
directions
as
to
the
placing
of
the
pictures
in
due
order
i
left
matters
to
him
and
in
three
days
for
like
an
angel
he
remained
his
saturday
at
my
urgent
request
all
the
walls
were
decorated
and
finished
properly
which
they
could
not
have
been
in
double
the
time
had
i
been
forced
to
rely
on
the
help
of
those
in
the
house
the
china
and
books
should
be
the
last
things
arranged
and
this
can
not
be
completed
i
fear
in
the
week
but
thanks
to
my
plan
of
short
curtains
and
no
blinds
any
window
can
be
arranged
in
exactly
ten
minutes
for
of
course
the
slight
brass
rods
should
be
in
place
before
the
move
begins
and
the
carpets
being
square
are
laid
in
about
half
an
hour
each
the
going
swiftly
from
room
to
room
and
the
maids
replacing
the
furniture
with
the
help
of
a
man
as
he
leaves
the
room
and
as
once
curtains
are
up
and
carpets
down
the
worst
of
the
battle
is
over
we
may
perhaps
even
arrange
the
china
and
books
before
sunday
and
so
spend
in
truth
a
real
day
of
rest
i
have
all
the
decorative
china
arranged
on
a
tiny
we
call
a
because
it
is
brought
into
use
for
choir
teas
and
other
similar
festivities
and
from
this
are
picked
out
quickly
and
easily
the
distinctive
pieces
devoted
to
each
room
the
are
up
and
then
the
books
being
packed
in
something
like
order
are
arranged
and
in
consequence
carefully
done
a
move
need
never
take
more
than
ten
days
and
it
would
be
simply
indefensible
were
not
the
house
absolutely
and
completely
straight
in
a
fortnight
and
above
all
let
the
apartments
and
the
nurseries
be
put
in
order
first
servants
as
a
rule
are
far
less
able
both
by
temperament
and
education
than
we
are
to
bear
being
out
of
their
ways
and
being
and
resent
as
no
really
trained
and
nature
resents
the
small
discomforts
that
we
know
will
soon
be
entirely
forgotten
but
that
are
apt
at
the
time
to
cause
friction
and
if
not
properly
legislated
for
may
even
lose
us
a
good
and
valuable
servant
and
inasmuch
as
we
have
had
an
education
and
advantages
and
inherit
in
some
cases
the
disciplined
nature
of
forefathers
and
mothers
equally
disciplined
and
educated
we
must
show
that
we
have
profited
by
these
said
advantages
at
such
times
as
these
and
whereas
we
know
that
our
maids
have
had
none
we
should
consider
them
and
look
after
them
much
as
we
should
after
children
being
quite
sure
we
shall
be
rewarded
after
our
struggles
by
cheerful
faces
and
willing
arms
that
are
twice
as
cheerful
and
willing
as
they
would
be
did
we
not
remember
to
tell
them
how
tired
they
must
be
and
to
see
they
have
extra
food
and
a
small
amount
of
coddling
even
to
carry
them
over
the
present
stress
of
work
the
children
should
not
return
until
one
sees
their
rooms
are
dry
and
warm
and
straight
this
like
all
the
rest
of
the
move
must
be
done
by
organisation
and
the
rooms
could
be
properly
ready
by
saturday
night
but
each
maid
must
be
told
off
to
the
different
rooms
and
the
mistress
and
her
daughter
and
i
do
hope
for
her
sake
she
may
have
that
most
invaluable
of
all
possessions
a
daughter
must
never
relax
their
supervision
else
sundry
gigglings
and
rompings
about
will
hinder
work
and
denote
that
like
most
young
feminine
creatures
the
maids
are
disorganised
by
the
presence
of
the
opposite
sex
and
are
endeavouring
to
combine
amusement
and
work
in
a
most
unsatisfactory
and
impossible
manner
the
master
of
the
house
poor
creature
will
confine
his
energies
in
most
cases
to
paying
for
the
move
or
if
he
be
very
exemplary
after
arranging
the
he
will
see
to
the
books
and
help
with
the
pictures
i
have
even
heard
rumours
of
men
who
are
most
useful
and
helpful
at
similar
crises
but
as
i
have
never
yet
found
any
male
rise
above
the
discomfort
sufficiently
to
be
of
real
use
in
the
matter
i
must
put
down
this
as
a
mere
rumour
only
hoping
that
it
may
be
true
he
is
however
invaluable
when
it
comes
to
managing
the
men
who
come
to
move
and
should
be
considered
angelic
if
he
does
not
grumble
over
his
scrappy
dinner
or
resent
the
fact
that
unless
he
can
go
to
an
hotel
he
is
not
likely
to
have
any
decent
meals
for
at
least
three
days
a
fact
a
woman
rather
enjoys
than
deplores
as
she
recognises
that
for
those
three
days
at
least
there
are
no
orders
to
give
and
no
regular
planning
of
food
to
be
done
the
first
few
days
in
a
new
house
are
replete
with
misery
on
the
commencement
of
our
tenancy
we
are
literally
besieged
by
the
tradesmen
coming
to
endeavour
to
secure
our
custom
but
we
should
be
wise
if
from
some
friend
we
were
to
obtain
a
list
of
those
who
are
really
reliable
until
we
are
able
to
send
round
to
the
butchers
and
obtain
lists
of
prices
from
all
for
comparison
and
have
time
to
discover
which
of
the
local
grocers
will
serve
us
at
prices
for
ready
money
but
under
no
circumstances
do
i
advise
allowing
a
man
to
call
for
orders
a
bill
being
the
one
of
all
others
that
is
liable
to
swell
to
gigantic
proportions
the
moment
a
daily
visit
is
permitted
the
maids
appear
to
rack
their
brains
to
see
what
they
can
order
and
i
have
saved
myself
at
least
five
shillings
a
week
since
i
put
a
veto
on
the
daily
call
which
seemed
a
signal
for
them
to
discover
that
hearthstones
vinegar
treacle
and
similar
objects
were
required
and
by
i
mean
articles
that
might
be
wanted
as
it
is
impossible
to
regulate
the
supplies
of
these
as
one
can
other
goods
and
as
i
have
had
far
less
of
all
since
i
send
a
written
order
to
either
shoolbred
or
whiteley
whose
men
are
not
naturally
in
the
least
likely
to
press
for
orders
and
whose
sole
duties
consist
in
bringing
the
things
and
receiving
payment
for
the
same
i
strongly
recommend
all
housewives
either
to
deal
with
them
or
to
go
to
the
local
grocers
themselves
and
at
once
impress
on
them
that
no
orders
given
in
the
kitchen
are
to
be
attended
to
under
any
pretext
whatever
the
tradesman
difficulty
is
the
first
misery
and
then
come
the
miseries
of
making
acquaintance
really
with
our
house
and
surroundings
we
are
sure
to
discover
a
thousand
small
vexatious
omissions
in
the
house
itself
and
above
all
mei
will
we
see
with
dismay
that
the
furniture
which
looked
quite
beautiful
in
our
old
home
has
suddenly
and
in
the
most
unprovoked
manner
become
absolutely
shabby
and
miserable
this
is
an
unanswerable
problem
but
it
is
a
fact
and
i
can
only
account
for
it
by
suggesting
that
the
new
paper
and
paint
are
to
blame
and
that
the
sooner
we
get
our
furniture
done
up
and
rejuvenated
the
sooner
shall
we
become
reconciled
to
our
new
house
but
of
course
this
costs
money
at
a
time
too
when
money
has
been
flowing
away
a
little
too
freely
to
be
pleasant
and
no
doubt
we
may
have
to
wait
another
reason
why
a
move
is
trying
and
why
like
marriage
it
should
never
be
undertaken
lightly
or
unadvisedly
and
at
first
we
must
make
the
best
of
our
surroundings
being
duly
thankful
for
the
square
carpets
and
the
light
short
curtains
that
save
us
so
much
piecing
and
planning
and
looking
forward
to
new
cretonne
and
tapestry
as
soon
as
we
can
afford
it
then
comes
the
misery
of
making
new
friends
and
here
i
would
say
a
word
of
warning
to
those
who
go
to
an
entirely
unknown
place
and
have
absolutely
no
introductions
the
best
and
nicest
folk
do
not
rush
to
call
on
new
people
unless
they
have
some
knowledge
of
them
therefore
wait
a
little
and
before
accepting
as
your
the
first
lady
who
enters
your
doors
for
doubtless
her
call
is
caused
by
curiosity
and
because
she
has
but
few
acquaintances
and
wishes
ardently
to
have
more
of
course
if
you
have
an
immense
house
and
heaps
of
money
everyone
calls
on
the
house
and
on
your
income
and
you
can
soon
discriminate
for
yourselves
who
is
likely
to
be
desirable
and
who
is
not
but
the
ordinary
householder
should
be
very
cautious
about
the
acquaintances
she
makes
until
she
feels
her
feet
and
can
find
out
somehow
it
is
from
the
clergyman
and
his
wife
generally
who
is
who
taking
care
in
her
turn
to
tell
enough
of
herself
and
her
forbears
to
show
that
she
is
respectable
at
any
rate
and
obtaining
in
due
course
the
same
sort
of
information
about
those
with
whom
she
is
surrounded
in
london
dear
lovely
unsnobbish
london
one
can
do
absolutely
as
one
likes
about
everything
and
nowhere
is
society
as
good
as
it
is
there
in
the
country
the
very
best
society
is
dull
in
london
one
can
meet
with
the
only
society
worth
having
in
my
opinion
the
society
of
those
who
either
in
art
literature
science
or
politics
have
something
and
are
making
the
history
of
the
world
from
this
country
folk
are
absolutely
debarred
another
reason
dear
readers
why
i
say
live
in
london
if
you
can
in
any
way
contrive
to
do
so
and
do
not
leave
it
on
any
pretext
whatever
but
as
man
must
associate
with
his
kind
or
perish
no
doubt
there
are
compensating
elements
in
country
society
that
are
evident
to
those
who
have
lived
among
it
all
their
lives
at
any
rate
we
can
live
more
unselfishly
in
the
country
and
do
more
good
to
those
of
our
poorer
brethren
than
we
can
in
these
crowded
streets
where
they
are
nothing
to
us
save
a
probable
source
of
infection
and
a
certain
source
of
annoyance
and
dread
to
sum
up
this
chapter
briefly
then
let
no
move
be
made
unless
such
a
course
is
absolutely
imperative
let
it
be
done
in
order
and
with
regularity
and
make
no
rushes
into
friendship
in
your
new
neighbourhood
until
you
have
discovered
who
is
who
and
made
due
inquiries
on
this
subject
and
above
all
under
all
circumstances
if
fate
has
absolutely
obliged
you
to
make
that
particular
move
make
the
best
of
it
and
always
either
mentally
or
openly
contrast
your
present
abode
unfavourably
and
with
your
last
location
you
have
to
live
where
you
have
pitched
your
tent
therefore
bad
as
the
place
may
appear
to
you
try
and
smother
your
feelings
until
use
has
made
you
reconciled
to
your
new
surroundings
even
if
has
not
asserted
its
charm
and
caused
you
to
become
fond
of
the
place
because
your
best
and
dearest
are
there
with
you
it
will
be
an
effort
i
can
assure
you
to
do
so
but
if
you
are
enough
to
suffer
in
silence
you
will
be
repaid
for
so
doing
a
chapter
ii
halls
and
passages
the
first
part
of
the
new
house
that
should
be
attacked
by
the
art
is
undoubtedly
the
hall
and
as
undoubtedly
it
is
here
that
the
ordinary
speculative
builder
surpasses
himself
for
as
a
rule
the
moment
one
opens
the
front
door
one
falls
up
the
staircase
or
else
one
is
confronted
by
a
long
hopeless
passage
which
strikes
a
chill
into
the
stoutest
heart
especially
if
the
owner
of
that
heart
has
not
had
much
experience
in
the
art
of
to
make
the
of
a
very
bad
state
of
affairs
but
in
these
days
of
ours
nothing
in
the
way
of
amelioration
is
impossible
and
indeed
were
i
given
i
would
undertake
to
make
the
most
hideous
square
house
a
bower
of
beauty
that
sounds
very
egotistical
but
i
really
do
not
mean
it
to
be
so
i
only
should
like
to
impress
upon
my
readers
that
never
before
has
so
much
attention
been
given
to
decoration
of
houses
as
is
given
now
and
that
by
the
aid
of
carefully
planned
woodwork
and
by
using
arches
on
the
plan
of
the
moorish
fretwork
first
introduced
by
liberty
a
square
room
can
be
made
picturesque
and
a
long
narrow
passage
pleasant
to
contemplate
by
simply
putting
up
a
series
of
slight
arches
or
else
by
curtaining
off
portions
of
it
by
aid
of
simple
wooden
partitions
such
as
are
illustrated
on
page
i
am
very
proud
indeed
of
this
sketch
as
it
was
made
from
a
brilliant
inspiration
of
mine
for
a
house
where
the
instant
one
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
street
one
was
confronted
by
the
stairs
on
one
hand
and
a
long
uninteresting
straight
passage
on
the
other
and
i
was
indeed
pleased
when
i
suddenly
saw
that
a
couple
of
arches
could
be
cut
out
from
what
might
have
been
a
partition
placed
along
the
foot
of
the
stairs
from
one
side
of
the
hall
to
the
other
and
that
the
arch
at
the
stair
foot
could
be
curtained
by
a
double
curtain
or
pair
of
curtains
which
would
fall
together
when
anyone
raised
it
to
go
upstairs
while
the
other
arch
could
be
draped
either
to
the
left
or
right
with
a
heavy
piece
of
material
according
to
the
position
of
the
wall
or
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
way
of
a
cupboard
or
door
to
be
concealed
treated
in
this
way
the
ordinary
tiresome
little
hall
of
a
london
house
is
metamorphosed
at
once
and
as
the
wooden
framework
can
be
so
arranged
that
it
can
be
screwed
into
the
wall
and
so
be
made
removable
at
will
i
am
quite
sure
this
notion
of
mine
will
on
as
the
yankees
say
more
especially
as
wallace
of
curtain
road
are
willing
to
erect
it
ready
painted
and
varnished
at
about
a
foot
that
is
to
say
if
the
illustration
fig
hall
arrangement
passage
were
six
feet
wide
the
arches
would
cost
about
if
twelve
and
so
on
the
arches
could
be
enamelled
to
match
the
hall
decorations
and
the
curtains
could
be
of
some
heavy
material
like
the
tapestry
or
the
beautiful
jute
velvet
or
bokhara
plush
which
is
undoubtedly
material
for
draping
while
even
the
humbler
serge
is
not
to
be
despised
but
in
this
case
the
curtain
in
the
stair
arch
should
be
made
double
and
very
full
a
great
deal
of
the
appearance
of
this
depending
on
full
graceful
curtains
and
proper
draperies
it
would
even
be
possible
in
a
hall
arranged
like
this
to
have
one
of
the
hideous
hat
and
coat
rails
which
die
so
hard
but
even
here
i
again
repeat
my
warning
against
these
monstrosities
they
can
never
look
like
anything
save
wives
hanging
up
against
the
wall
and
are
always
a
temptation
to
the
gentle
burglar
or
the
common
area
sneak
who
delights
to
make
off
with
coats
and
hats
even
if
he
can
find
nothing
else
but
if
the
master
of
the
house
declines
to
allow
himself
to
be
educated
up
to
keeping
his
garments
out
of
sight
he
may
be
humoured
by
allowing
him
a
place
behind
the
hall
curtain
which
should
be
then
properly
draped
in
such
a
manner
that
the
coats
and
hats
would
be
completely
hidden
a
china
or
brass
receptacle
for
umbrellas
could
be
put
on
the
other
side
of
the
convenient
curtain
also
and
so
all
these
most
undecorative
items
will
be
put
out
of
sight
thus
causing
the
arches
to
be
as
useful
as
they
are
undoubtedly
ornamental
in
many
houses
the
staircase
goes
up
at
the
side
and
does
not
face
the
front
door
and
here
too
the
arches
come
in
with
great
effect
i
mean
in
those
houses
where
there
is
a
straight
passage
from
the
front
door
to
a
room
opposite
which
faces
the
door
and
so
ends
the
house
in
the
passage
there
are
usually
two
doors
one
on
either
side
belonging
to
the
dining
and
morning
rooms
the
end
room
being
often
enough
a
small
back
room
or
as
was
the
case
in
our
house
at
shortlands
even
the
itself
there
the
passage
opens
out
on
the
right
hand
and
discloses
the
staircase
close
by
the
door
and
a
passage
leading
to
the
lavatory
here
the
arches
conceal
the
staircase
at
once
and
also
the
latter
arrangement
and
make
a
decoration
out
of
what
is
always
to
me
a
great
eyesore
in
one
case
where
the
arches
have
been
erected
the
passage
led
to
the
pantry
the
door
of
which
always
stood
invitingly
open
disclosing
sink
and
generally
to
the
eyes
of
the
critical
caller
the
curtain
conceals
all
that
now
splendidly
and
the
whole
arrangement
gives
an
idea
of
space
and
which
is
really
marvellous
when
we
came
to
our
present
abode
the
hall
here
struck
me
with
dismay
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
understand
in
the
least
what
could
be
done
with
it
it
was
exactly
like
a
telescope
with
a
hideous
window
at
one
end
opening
out
on
to
several
dead
trees
and
what
looked
like
the
family
washing
with
doors
appearing
just
where
such
doors
should
be
concealed
and
of
course
it
had
beautiful
marble
papers
and
graining
and
a
dado
of
a
dark
and
hideous
design
in
varnished
paper
too
the
however
i
did
not
consider
but
i
racked
my
brains
about
the
long
narrow
awful
passage
called
by
courtesy
hall
and
at
last
i
had
an
inspiration
i
ran
a
wooden
partition
across
about
ten
feet
from
the
end
of
the
place
and
behind
that
put
in
a
hot
and
cold
water
arrangement
and
made
it
into
a
regular
opening
out
another
door
into
that
which
previously
opened
out
into
a
tiny
passage
leading
into
the
fourth
which
would
have
been
absolutely
unusable
had
not
this
been
done
and
then
by
the
aid
of
bent
laths
and
a
little
plaster
two
arches
were
made
in
the
passage
draped
one
to
the
right
the
other
to
the
left
with
a
looped
with
cords
and
tassels
and
so
i
obtained
what
old
astley
used
to
call
a
a
vista
and
made
a
really
decorated
spot
out
of
a
most
commonplace
passage
of
course
all
the
coats
and
hats
are
in
the
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
hall
itself
save
the
buffet
illustrated
on
next
page
which
is
in
old
oak
and
which
always
looks
nice
and
forms
a
place
where
the
cards
of
visitors
can
be
placed
or
the
letters
from
the
post
or
other
trifles
a
couple
of
chairs
for
emergencies
the
gong
and
one
of
beautiful
red
pots
on
a
bamboo
stand
holding
one
of
the
aspidistras
which
will
live
in
draughts
and
successfully
bear
uncomplainingly
what
would
certainly
kill
at
once
any
other
plant
completing
the
furniture
of
this
hall
my
readers
will
be
amused
to
hear
that
since
i
wrote
kitchen
to
i
have
learned
a
very
great
illustration
fig
oak
buffet
many
things
indeed
if
i
had
not
i
should
most
certainly
not
be
writing
a
second
instalment
of
however
as
one
of
these
items
is
undoubtedly
about
the
hall
i
am
now
going
to
mention
it
here
at
once
reluctantly
but
emphatically
have
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
where
hard
wear
is
expected
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
have
linoleum
of
some
kind
or
the
other
on
the
floor
of
course
a
great
many
households
are
provided
with
nice
tiles
which
i
can
never
look
at
without
envy
but
as
the
majority
of
folks
are
not
so
highly
favoured
and
as
most
households
possess
boys
and
many
have
dogs
too
i
have
regretfully
discovered
that
if
a
house
is
to
be
kept
clean
and
tidy
the
hall
must
have
some
material
to
cover
it
that
can
be
washed
daily
and
so
can
be
perpetually
and
properly
kept
in
order
there
is
a
particularly
pretty
linoleum
made
by
the
staines
linoleum
company
in
queen
victoria
street
which
resembles
tiny
squares
of
black
and
white
marble
which
looks
very
well
down
of
course
it
is
a
sham
and
as
such
is
to
be
deprecated
but
i
can
not
help
recommending
it
as
it
looks
so
clean
and
nice
and
bright
and
would
do
admirably
in
some
halls
while
for
those
who
will
not
allow
any
shams
anywhere
in
their
houses
nothing
looks
so
nice
as
the
darkest
brown
linoleum
put
down
all
over
the
passages
and
halls
with
some
and
even
larger
rugs
about
the
rugs
must
be
as
large
as
possible
as
little
rugs
are
apt
to
slip
and
move
under
the
feet
they
also
have
a
most
aggravating
manner
of
turning
up
at
the
edges
and
becoming
shabby
while
the
large
rugs
will
wear
for
years
and
stand
really
very
hard
wear
too
these
are
about
at
either
or
and
measure
about
three
yards
long
by
about
one
and
a
half
yards
wide
i
say
about
as
none
of
these
rugs
seem
to
me
to
be
exactly
the
same
size
but
this
is
near
enough
to
give
my
readers
some
idea
of
how
many
they
would
require
if
they
elect
to
put
them
down
in
their
halls
the
smaller
rugs
are
about
six
feet
long
and
about
four
wide
these
should
have
a
wide
binding
sown
on
at
the
back
top
and
bottom
with
a
few
shots
or
else
those
round
leaden
weights
used
in
jackets
underneath
the
binding
to
keep
the
ends
down
and
prevent
the
curling
which
is
so
unsightly
and
tiresome
in
these
small
rugs
and
on
damp
should
be
lined
at
the
back
with
american
leather
linoleum
should
never
be
scrubbed
with
soap
and
water
for
this
removes
the
pattern
but
should
be
rubbed
with
a
wet
to
remove
the
dirt
and
then
polished
with
sour
milk
and
water
plain
brown
linoleum
should
be
kept
in
order
with
linseed
oil
boiled
and
turpentine
mixed
this
is
specially
required
at
first
for
like
all
materials
which
have
no
pattern
on
it
shows
every
footmark
and
at
first
appears
as
if
it
were
going
to
wear
villainously
but
the
oil
and
turpentine
soon
restore
it
and
the
rugs
prevent
the
usual
miserable
effect
of
a
plain
material
which
i
can
not
think
why
always
wears
badly
if
left
to
itself
and
invariably
looks
untidy
and
shabby
almost
before
it
is
down
therefore
we
may
consider
it
an
axiom
that
if
we
are
not
provided
with
a
good
tiled
floor
we
can
not
do
better
than
have
either
the
staines
linoleum
to
simulate
marble
or
the
plain
linoleum
and
rugs
this
for
preference
the
linoleum
should
be
washed
daily
with
a
damp
duster
and
the
rugs
shaken
and
once
a
week
all
should
be
cleaned
with
the
linseed
oil
and
turpentine
this
will
double
the
wear
and
insure
all
marks
being
quite
removed
another
thing
which
i
have
most
certainly
learned
is
that
delightful
as
felt
looks
and
feels
and
that
beautiful
as
are
the
colours
in
which
it
is
made
it
is
absolutely
worthless
for
real
wear
i
had
it
laid
down
in
the
watford
house
when
we
went
there
all
over
the
halls
and
passages
and
on
the
stairs
too
and
was
quite
delighted
with
the
soft
warm
feel
thereof
and
the
appearance
was
equally
pleasing
but
we
had
not
been
there
six
months
before
that
wretched
stuff
became
the
curse
of
the
household
every
single
drop
of
water
every
thread
or
morsel
of
dust
every
footmark
showed
and
from
morning
until
night
something
had
to
be
done
in
the
shape
of
brushing
and
dusting
and
even
then
we
were
never
clean
and
never
tidy
and
then
in
addition
to
its
other
sins
if
the
abominable
material
did
not
begin
to
go
into
holes
all
along
the
edges
of
the
stairs
tiny
white
spots
showed
where
the
under
felt
was
working
through
and
before
a
year
was
out
all
the
wretched
stuff
had
to
be
removed
and
replaced
in
the
hall
with
dark
brown
linoleum
and
rugs
and
on
the
stairs
by
beautiful
brussels
carpet
which
after
a
hard
wear
looks
really
better
than
it
did
the
first
day
it
was
put
down
and
i
can
never
understand
how
anyone
can
ever
recommend
felt
as
i
am
convinced
it
is
absolutely
worthless
as
a
and
that
nothing
can
make
it
at
all
satisfactory
and
as
i
still
see
it
in
shops
and
notice
it
pressed
on
the
attention
of
those
about
to
furnish
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
warn
my
readers
against
it
for
if
they
succumb
to
its
fascinating
appearance
they
will
inevitably
suffer
from
its
possession
in
the
same
way
that
i
did
another
thing
i
most
strongly
advise
my
readers
to
possess
themselves
of
if
in
any
way
they
can
is
a
really
good
there
should
be
no
fidgety
border
or
differently
coloured
pattern
on
them
to
attract
the
eye
and
tease
the
brain
but
there
should
be
merely
a
simple
pattern
in
the
lighter
shade
on
a
darker
ground
this
always
looks
well
and
at
the
same
time
does
not
tire
one
as
an
accentuated
pattern
invariably
does
i
therefore
recommend
excellent
brussels
and
wilton
pile
carpets
inches
wide
the
one
at
the
other
at
the
yard
for
they
are
absolutely
faultless
both
in
design
and
colour
and
can
be
as
absolutely
relied
on
both
for
wear
and
appearance
wallace
brussels
at
would
be
nice
if
expense
is
a
very
great
object
and
their
burmese
carpet
with
a
design
on
is
also
to
be
recommended
and
no
one
can
go
wrong
about
their
if
they
make
a
judicious
selection
from
these
four
qualities
and
designs
i
am
perpetually
asked
for
a
really
good
artistic
and
satisfactory
carpet
at
a
very
low
price
but
i
as
often
reply
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
supply
you
with
a
really
good
diamond
necklace
for
a
few
shillings
for
such
a
thing
does
not
exist
you
can
get
very
carpets
for
a
little
money
the
burmese
carpet
is
ridiculously
cheap
and
very
satisfactory
but
for
real
hard
wear
brussels
or
pile
must
be
chosen
and
for
a
really
good
thing
one
must
always
pay
and
it
is
far
cheaper
in
the
long
run
to
buy
what
is
really
good
than
to
be
perpetually
vexed
at
the
wear
and
tear
which
invariably
surprises
and
annoys
us
come
when
it
may
i
therefore
very
strongly
advise
all
who
can
to
invest
in
really
good
even
if
they
content
themselves
with
something
far
less
expensive
for
the
other
rooms
then
too
i
should
much
like
to
impress
on
my
readers
that
the
hideous
glass
one
usually
finds
ready
for
one
either
each
side
of
the
front
door
or
else
as
elaborate
fanlights
over
the
doors
in
the
passage
should
be
removed
and
replaced
by
cathedral
glass
in
leaded
squares
or
by
if
however
this
is
impossible
though
the
expense
is
not
great
and
the
effect
thereof
is
admirable
let
the
grained
and
patterned
glass
be
covered
by
a
really
excellent
imitation
of
the
cathedral
glass
this
is
to
be
obtained
from
graham
biddle
graham
house
oxford
street
and
is
floated
on
glass
in
the
same
manner
in
which
the
ancient
and
much
despised
used
to
be
managed
and
really
has
quite
a
surprising
effect
a
third
way
would
be
to
remove
the
glass
and
replace
it
with
quite
plain
clear
glass
covered
inside
by
a
fluted
curtain
of
good
madras
muslin
in
really
artistic
colours
no
one
who
has
not
risen
in
rebellion
against
the
arrangement
of
starred
or
patterned
glass
can
imagine
how
immensely
any
place
is
improved
by
removing
it
altogether
and
replacing
it
with
something
else
and
though
this
may
appear
a
trifle
to
write
about
i
can
assure
you
that
it
is
only
by
strict
attention
to
such
trifles
that
one
can
produce
an
artistic
whole
which
shall
be
entirely
and
absolutely
satisfactory
in
every
way
and
after
all
these
small
matters
cost
far
less
than
the
elaborately
draped
curtains
the
fitted
carpets
the
giant
sideboards
and
the
other
expensive
monstrosities
against
which
i
am
always
waging
war
to
be
really
perfect
the
hall
should
be
a
square
space
in
the
centre
of
the
house
where
a
big
fire
could
blaze
in
winter
and
masses
of
flowers
could
greet
the
incoming
guest
when
dear
delightful
summer
makes
fires
unnecessary
and
naturally
such
a
hall
would
require
very
different
treatment
to
the
ordinary
long
and
narrow
passage
but
if
the
staircase
sweeps
out
of
the
hall
i
should
still
suggest
my
arches
here
they
would
hide
the
stairs
never
very
lovely
objects
at
the
best
of
times
and
obscure
the
glimpses
of
ascending
and
descending
legs
which
especially
in
the
days
of
crinolines
made
going
up
or
down
stairs
a
penance
indeed
to
any
one
who
had
to
perform
the
ascent
and
descent
in
the
face
of
a
numerous
company
gathered
in
the
hall
besides
which
a
sense
of
snugness
would
be
given
to
the
whole
place
which
it
could
never
have
were
that
open
space
left
unprotected
stretching
up
into
the
air
as
a
rule
the
square
hall
should
be
treated
as
far
as
mere
goes
in
the
same
manner
as
the
passages
which
lead
out
of
it
are
treated
but
here
it
would
be
quite
in
character
were
fresh
colours
introduced
or
the
style
of
decoration
reversed
that
is
to
say
if
the
dado
which
is
imperative
in
a
narrow
passage
were
replaced
by
the
same
decoration
used
as
a
frieze
taking
care
only
that
the
colours
should
harmonise
for
example
supposing
the
passages
themselves
were
decorated
in
brown
and
gold
the
brown
being
the
design
printed
on
real
brown
paper
by
essex
albert
mansions
victoria
street
at
five
shillings
and
sixpence
the
piece
the
dados
being
of
a
really
good
and
strong
gold
japanese
leather
paper
the
inner
or
square
hall
could
be
papered
in
the
same
manner
using
however
the
japanese
gold
paper
as
a
frieze
the
could
be
picture
and
china
rail
holding
big
jugs
and
blue
and
white
china
of
all
kinds
and
thus
a
charming
effect
would
be
obtained
suitable
for
the
squareness
of
the
hall
and
yet
harmonising
absolutely
with
the
passages
which
lead
out
of
it
in
such
a
hall
as
this
the
ceiling
should
be
divided
into
squares
this
can
be
done
quite
easily
nowadays
by
a
series
of
laths
or
mouldings
made
on
purpose
this
is
nailed
into
the
laths
above
the
ceiling
with
long
thin
nails
a
very
good
moulding
made
on
purpose
is
sold
by
haines
queen
victoria
street
at
about
one
penny
a
foot
and
the
squares
thus
made
are
filled
either
with
a
good
ceiling
paper
or
else
by
an
admirably
decorative
material
exactly
like
moulded
plaster
also
sold
by
haines
and
called
anaglypta
this
costs
about
for
a
ceiling
and
when
up
all
should
have
a
coat
of
ivory
silicate
paint
or
else
of
the
invaluable
and
admirable
aspinall
enamel
also
in
ivory
for
though
builders
may
argue
and
decorators
implore
for
a
heavier
and
more
ornate
system
of
treating
the
ceiling
and
cornice
i
can
not
too
emphatically
condemn
any
colouring
being
introduced
into
the
ceiling
and
surrounding
plaster
work
in
lines
and
distracting
contrasts
of
colour
thus
bringing
the
ceiling
down
on
our
heads
depressing
one
dreadfully
and
all
too
often
bringing
into
notice
much
which
would
be
better
left
to
obscurity
but
my
readers
must
not
imagine
from
the
above
that
i
am
recommending
for
one
moment
the
ordinary
ugly
the
mere
appearance
of
which
ruins
any
room
or
that
i
am
ceasing
to
love
the
papered
ceiling
indeed
i
am
not
colour
of
some
kind
is
necessary
there
as
well
as
anywhere
else
but
the
colour
must
be
ivory
or
faint
green
blue
or
yellow
and
must
not
be
daubed
on
by
the
heavy
hand
of
the
decorator
revelling
in
golds
and
reds
and
blues
in
bewildering
confusion
and
even
introducing
dreadful
real
or
imitation
oak
beams
all
well
enough
in
houses
where
they
are
part
of
the
fabric
and
have
the
sentiment
and
beauty
of
age
to
defend
their
existence
but
absolutely
indefensible
in
an
ordinary
london
house
or
small
suburban
villa
as
indefensible
as
is
old
oak
furbished
up
in
tottenham
court
road
and
made
ghastly
with
sticky
varnished
paint
or
stain
when
placed
in
a
house
that
has
the
nineteenth
century
and
speculative
builder
written
large
all
over
it
in
the
bulging
walls
its
vilely
drawn
lines
and
its
rawness
and
newness
and
vulgarity
of
style
for
it
is
no
use
attempting
to
have
a
pretty
house
unless
we
are
absolutely
and
begin
by
forbidding
the
decorator
to
do
anything
but
what
he
is
told
to
do
and
it
is
much
wiser
to
write
down
exactly
at
the
commencement
of
our
decorations
on
precept
upon
line
by
word
for
each
room
exactly
what
we
wish
the
room
to
be
arranged
like
putting
on
paper
the
name
and
number
of
the
wall
paper
the
colour
of
the
paint
and
in
fact
every
single
thing
so
that
at
the
end
there
can
be
no
mistake
and
above
all
we
must
not
be
persuaded
out
of
our
own
ideas
by
the
builder
or
by
the
upholsterer
or
by
anyone
at
all
once
we
have
made
up
our
minds
what
we
intend
to
have
for
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
if
we
are
we
shall
repent
it
for
ever
after
i
am
often
much
disappointed
to
find
after
i
have
taken
real
and
elaborate
pains
to
tell
people
exactly
how
their
houses
should
be
decorated
that
they
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
talked
over
by
the
builder
or
the
decorator
and
that
in
consequence
i
am
again
sent
for
at
double
the
expense
of
course
to
tell
them
how
to
get
over
or
in
some
measure
mitigate
the
horrors
that
have
been
perpetrated
is
such
a
nuisance
to
run
from
shop
to
shop
getting
all
the
different
papers
says
one
the
builder
had
almost
the
same
sort
of
design
in
his
book
and
said
his
hung
much
better
than
those
you
we
time
says
another
so
we
left
it
to
the
builder
and
now
please
dear
panton
do
help
us
again
for
the
house
does
look
horrid
and
we
can
not
think
why
and
of
course
i
go
and
could
weep
really
weep
over
the
waste
of
money
time
and
material
which
would
all
have
been
saved
had
they
handed
the
builder
my
written
plan
of
decorations
and
told
him
that
that
and
that
only
was
to
be
the
order
for
the
work
and
decoration
is
really
so
easy
nowadays
that
like
moving
it
need
only
be
done
slowly
and
in
order
to
be
an
absolute
success
all
that
is
required
from
the
builder
is
the
plan
of
each
room
you
then
write
to
the
paper
manufacturer
for
as
many
pieces
of
paper
at
so
much
so
many
yards
for
the
dados
or
frieze
this
is
ascertained
by
simply
measuring
round
the
room
with
a
tape
to
aspinall
for
so
much
paint
a
gallon
at
does
quite
a
large
room
and
then
having
collected
your
materials
set
to
work
the
painter
has
not
to
exercise
his
genius
or
discretion
at
all
he
has
simply
to
do
as
he
is
told
and
this
being
understood
one
is
spared
the
endless
discussions
with
the
builder
who
wants
to
sell
you
some
of
the
reams
of
hideous
paper
he
has
bought
wholesale
and
for
a
mere
song
at
a
sale
of
the
of
of
some
and
who
makes
a
great
parade
of
the
printed
prices
at
the
back
of
the
sheets
trusting
that
you
are
innocent
of
the
knowledge
that
on
all
papers
the
regular
discount
is
per
and
that
his
own
particular
stock
has
been
purchased
at
almost
prices
because
the
manufacturer
was
only
too
pleased
to
get
rid
of
what
ordinary
upholsterers
and
decorators
had
absolutely
refused
to
take
up
and
who
is
persuasive
and
pleading
and
finally
impertinent
when
he
discovers
he
has
an
adept
to
deal
with
and
not
one
of
the
numerous
victims
erstwhile
so
easily
bullied
or
fatigued
into
putting
up
almost
anything
he
shows
them
in
order
to
get
rid
of
and
see
the
last
of
him
i
think
the
hall
and
passage
are
good
spots
in
which
to
once
more
enforce
the
above
details
for
all
should
be
done
at
the
beginning
at
the
entrance
as
it
were
or
else
the
worry
and
disappointments
will
be
endless
therefore
i
can
not
consider
the
disquisition
in
which
i
have
indulged
out
of
place
and
i
feel
i
can
not
too
much
or
too
often
impress
on
my
readers
the
absolute
necessity
of
being
sure
what
they
want
themselves
before
sending
for
the
decorator
he
must
only
be
the
hands
to
execute
the
work
and
he
must
be
absolutely
silent
about
colours
and
patterns
of
paper
if
the
house
is
to
be
a
success
at
all
there
are
several
other
schemes
of
decoration
that
are
absolutely
successful
in
a
hall
which
were
not
spoken
of
in
kitchen
to
garret
and
which
can
be
mentioned
here
before
passing
away
from
the
hall
altogether
although
there
are
several
things
still
to
be
said
about
it
and
indeed
as
in
all
that
regards
decoration
it
is
an
absolutely
inexhaustible
subject
as
new
and
pretty
things
appear
daily
and
good
combinations
of
colour
are
constantly
suggesting
themselves
to
the
decorative
mind
for
the
ordinary
long
dark
passage
i
would
suggest
that
yellow
and
white
should
be
used
taking
the
place
of
white
should
there
be
very
much
traffic
in
the
place
or
should
there
be
necessity
for
a
certain
amount
of
economy
very
small
halls
look
nice
with
yellow
and
white
berry
paper
at
a
piece
a
matting
dado
in
plain
white
with
all
ivory
paint
and
yellow
and
white
ceiling
paper
at
a
piece
the
matting
dado
being
replaced
by
arras
cloth
at
a
yard
and
all
paint
where
it
is
considered
desirable
to
have
a
darker
arrangement
than
would
be
obtained
by
the
ivory
and
white
the
arras
is
very
wide
inches
and
would
in
consequence
cover
a
much
larger
than
the
matting
does
neither
is
it
so
difficult
to
manage
as
is
matting
but
both
should
be
secured
at
the
bottom
by
tacks
and
at
the
top
by
a
light
wooden
rail
sold
by
haines
of
queen
victoria
street
at
something
under
a
foot
this
should
be
screwed
to
the
wall
and
could
be
removed
arras
or
matting
and
all
at
any
time
which
it
could
not
be
were
ordinary
nails
employed
and
a
simple
and
hideous
paper
dado
could
replace
the
more
expensive
were
the
owner
to
remove
and
wish
to
take
the
dado
with
him
a
plain
and
a
tidy
wall
being
all
that
could
be
demanded
of
him
by
his
landlord
beauty
and
Ã¦stheticism
are
not
in
the
bond
that
exists
between
him
and
his
tenant
another
arrangement
would
be
beautiful
c
at
a
piece
and
yellow
matting
dado
and
all
paint
and
a
ceiling
paper
in
red
and
cream
the
at
would
do
quite
well
with
either
of
these
schemes
dull
red
pile
carpet
would
be
best
for
the
stairs
and
a
good
many
oriental
rugs
should
be
about
the
hall
any
draperies
over
the
doors
should
be
the
dull
red
tapestry
sold
by
wallace
or
of
mandarin
yellow
serge
this
of
course
being
much
cheaper
than
the
brocade
which
is
as
against
the
of
the
ever
useful
serge
if
yellow
should
be
objected
to
and
nothing
is
so
useful
or
so
successful
in
a
dark
passage
blue
should
be
the
next
colour
to
be
thought
about
and
blue
tulip
damasque
is
a
most
valuable
paper
for
a
blue
hall
this
is
only
a
piece
and
splendidly
and
a
very
original
effect
would
be
produced
by
this
paper
a
high
dado
of
red
and
gold
leather
paper
and
all
dull
red
paint
the
red
of
the
paint
to
match
the
curious
appearance
of
the
red
in
the
japanese
leather
paper
the
stair
carpet
should
be
red
and
the
ceiling
paper
yellow
and
white
as
a
rule
ceiling
paper
at
a
piece
is
quite
good
enough
for
anything
but
if
people
do
not
mind
spending
a
little
more
money
haines
has
a
charming
ceiling
paper
at
in
yellow
and
white
which
being
of
a
more
geometrical
and
better
design
in
every
way
would
be
perfect
for
ceilings
although
as
i
said
before
where
money
is
an
object
the
yellow
and
white
ceiling
paper
is
all
that
is
absolutely
necessary
and
really
answers
remarkably
well
should
a
red
hall
be
desired
b
at
can
not
be
improved
upon
cream
or
else
paint
should
be
used
a
red
and
white
matting
for
the
dado
not
a
check
matting
but
one
which
has
a
red
line
in
it
and
dark
blue
art
carpet
on
the
floor
blue
and
white
ceiling
paper
maple
a
piece
any
draperies
should
be
either
blue
or
red
and
the
khelims
would
show
off
admirably
in
a
house
arranged
and
decorated
in
this
way
for
their
eastern
colourings
would
appear
to
advantage
against
the
red
and
cream
walls
this
is
a
bold
decoration
but
one
that
looks
extremely
well
as
does
even
a
bolder
arrangement
consisting
of
the
b
all
stained

a
dull
green

burr
oxford

dull

his
little
settle
being
particularly
adapted
for
use
in
a
hall
where
no
more
furniture
should
be
allowed
than
is
absolutely
necessary
unless
the
hall
can
by
reason
of
its
size
and
design
be
used
as
a
room
and
treated
and
furnished
like
one
i
can
not
and
never
do
recommend
either
a
or
real
green
wall
the
latter
is
such
a
nondescript
and
uncertain
colour
that
the
use
of
it
in
the
entrance
appears
to
me
to
strike
the
keynote
to
the
character
of
the
inhabitants
who
are
thus
pronounced
uncertain
in
their
ideas
and
not
particularly
satisfactory
and
there
are
so
many
in
the
shape
of
dull
gloomy
papers
that
inexperienced
folks
are
apt
to
buy
simply
because
the
pure
word
implies
to
a
certain
class
of
mind
that
the
paper
is
artistic
and
high
art
that
i
am
impelled
to
taboo
altogether
at
once
but
if
and
damasque
papers
are
bought
a
wall
may
be
indulged
in
though
i
can
never
pronounce
this
as
totally
satisfactory
as
are
the
red
blue
and
yellow
and
brown
walls
if
the
is
selected
i
advise
ivory
paint
if
that
can
not
be
indulged
in
a
shade
of
dull
green

be
chosen

harmonise
with

japanese

the

so
should
the

a

be
arranged

the

the

this

would
be
artistic
but
a
cooler
effect
and
one
that
would
be
specially
adapted
for
a
hot
hall
one
into
which
much
sun
pours
would
be
obtained
by
using
the
green
and
silver
paper
paint
and
all
pale
green
draperies
and
a
green
carpet
using
white
and
green
muslin
on
the
windows
and
any
white
and
green
china
to
hold
flowers
and
plants
that
one
can
find
once
the
papering
and
painting
are
done
and
the
are
down
and
the
draperies
are
up
serious
attention
must
be
given
to
the
trifles
which
appear
scarcely
worth
seeing
to
but
on
which
depend
so
much
and
which
i
have
spoken
about
in
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
for
it
is
of
no
use
to
put
charming
papers
on
our
walls
if
we
leave
hideous
glass
in
the
doors
or
allow
our
staircase
windows
to
glare
at
us
with
strips
of
yellow
blue
and
red
glass
for
edges
round
a
starred
centre
in
a
manner
found
even
in
these
artistic
days
in
houses
where
people
should
presumably
know
better
and
i
therefore
repeat
my
advice
to
my
readers
to
look
out
for
the
trifles
and
never
to
rest
until
all
they
possess
has
some
beauty
to
excuse
its
existence
perhaps
the
most
tiresome
thing
in
the
orthodox
hall
is
the
ordinary
long
staircase
window
but
this
can
be
improved
at
very
small
cost
if
a
little
artistic
talent
is
brought
to
bear
upon
it
if
it
can
be
afforded
in
any
way
the
window
can
be
made
beautiful
by
filling
it
in
with
cathedral
glass
in
leaded
squares
and
about
three
or
four
really
good
medallions
in
stained
glass
could
be
hung
about
these
can
be
procured
from
pither
mortimer
street
regent
street
a
wide
shelf
should
be
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
window
and
china
could
be
arranged
there
on
the
landing
could
be
placed
a
tall
grandfather
clock
in
such
a
way
that
the
face
faces
the
hall
and
if
there
is
room
a
big
palm
in
a
stand
adds
much
to
the
effect
this
would
obviate
any
necessity
for
draperies
always
rather
difficult
to
keep
clean
in
this
exalted
situation
if
this
arrangement
is
too
expensive
a
wooden
arch
should
be
placed
round
the
top
of
the
window
and
the
woodwork
should
taper
down
each
side
to
the
bottom
of
the
window
illustrated
in
fig
and
a
soft
silk
drapery
should
be
caught
up
on
one
side
this
is
confined
by
a
cord
passed
over
a
nail
which
can
be
loosened
by
releasing
the
cord
the
curtain
then
falls
over
the
windows
and
either
obscures
the
sunshine
or
the
darkness
according
to
whether
it
is
lowered
at
night
or
day
although
i
should
personally
prefer
to
leave
it
draped
and
to
hang
a
lamp
up
in
the
arch
which
could
be
lighted
at
night
plants
or
china
could
be
arranged
along
the
ledge
and
make
a
charming
picture
out
of
what
is
usually
an
intensely
ugly
spot
another
great
difficulty
is
the
usual
london
landing
where
sometimes
a
couple
of
chairs
are
put
on
which
no
one
ever
sits
flanked
by
a
table
no
one
ever
dusts
or
by
a
couple
of
palms
everyone
forgets
to
water
here
a
really
clear
brain
is
required
to
cope
with
the
difficulties
and
i
have
had
a
sketch
done
by
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
made
a
perfectly
charming
corner
out
of
this
generally
hideous
spot
which
i
hope
will
speak
for
itself
and
shows
what
can
be
made
out
of
a
similar
landing
with
trouble
and
a
good
deal
of
really
artistic
feeling
in
this
same
house
the
second
door
to
the
which
is
never
used
and
only
looks
frightful
to
those
who
come
up
the
stairs
and
see
this
door
first
of
all
is
turned
into
a
cabinet
where
various
fans
and
curiosities
illustration
fig
staircase
window
illustration
fig
a
london
landing
generally
are
kept
the
sunken
space
between
the
wall
and
the
door
itself
being
amply
deep
enough
for
this
purpose
and
as
all
doors
can
be
made
to
open
into
a
room
the
deep
space
can
always
be
on
the
passage
side
the
flat
side
being
in
the
room
itself
and
hidden
by
a
straight
curtain
or
by
a
still
simpler
process
by
taking
off
all
the
mouldings
handles
and
papering
straight
over
the
door
just
as
if
it
were
a
portion
of
the
wall
itself
the
simple
sold
by
so
many
furniture
houses
nowadays
should
be
placed
over
the
doors
in
most
houses
in
the
hall
or
else
pictures
should
be
hung
there
and
indeed
one
can
not
have
too
many
good
pictures
anywhere
if
real
paintings
and
excellent
proof
engravings
are
not
to
be
afforded
do
let
me
beg
of
my
readers
to
indulge
themselves
in
autotypes
or
photographs
from
really
good
pictures
these
look
specially
well
in
a
hall
and
naturally
do
not
serve
as
dust
traps
as
do
far
too
many
of
the
japanese
ornaments
fans
skins
and
trophies
of
the
chase
which
are
usually
considered
appropriate
to
this
remarkably
dusty
and
trying
situation
pictures
can
be
dusted
daily
other
ornaments
require
more
time
and
attention
though
naturally
one
would
rather
have
these
than
nothing
if
one
can
not
afford
pictures
in
this
spot
while
the
finish
off
the
hall
and
can
have
the
five
or
six
china
ornaments
which
look
well
and
can
be
regularly
dusted
with
a
long
feather
brush
and
duly
washed
once
a
week
when
the
hall
is
entirely
turned
out
i
most
strongly
advise
the
hall
to
be
warmed
in
some
way
if
it
can
possibly
be
managed
and
i
must
own
that
i
never
can
understand
why
houses
are
built
year
after
year
without
this
simple
but
most
important
convenience
one
need
not
use
a
stove
because
one
has
it
but
it
should
never
be
out
of
power
to
thoroughly
warm
the
house
should
one
wish
to
do
so
and
i
look
forward
to
a
day
i
have
often
spoken
of
when
women
shall
qualify
as
architects
and
shall
turn
their
hands
entirely
to
domestic
architecture
until
then
i
suppose
we
must
go
on
grumbling
and
putting
up
with
grateless
halls
cupboardless
houses
and
rooms
where
no
provision
at
all
has
been
made
for
placing
a
bed
or
arranging
furniture
with
common
sense
to
say
nothing
of
artistic
grouping
that
of
course
is
absolutely
impossible
in
the
ordinary
square
recessless
house
with
which
we
are
now
so
very
liberally
provided
by
the
male
architect
but
if
in
any
way
possible
have
a
grate
put
into
the
hall
or
else
some
kind
of
stove
of
course
a
grate
means
a
chimney
and
this
is
not
always
forthcoming
when
wanted
but
a
grate
is
much
to
be
preferred
in
the
first
place
it
can
mean
a
pretty
mantel
and
and
cheerful
blazes
in
winter
and
pretty
flowers
in
summer
and
in
the
second
the
warmth
it
gives
is
separable
from
the
fumes
and
stuffy
feeling
that
one
always
finds
with
a
stove
no
matter
how
good
it
is
then
too
a
stove
is
hideous
it
help
being
so
and
it
is
frankly
frightful
still
if
warmth
can
not
be
got
into
a
hall
in
any
other
way
a
stove
must
be
used
and
i
think
the
one
sold
by
pither
in
mortimer
street
the
is
as
good
as
any
it
burns
a
long
time
without
any
attention
and
costs
very
little
indeed
i
think
something
like
twopence
for
the
twelve
hours
the
reason
why
i
impress
upon
my
readers
the
necessity
of
a
stove
is
that
i
can
not
believe
but
that
we
should
be
saved
an
immense
amount
of
illness
were
we
yet
more
particular
about
an
equal
temperature
than
we
are
as
a
rule
our
rooms
are
fairly
warm
but
in
the
winter
our
passages
are
like
ice
they
can
not
help
being
so
windows
must
be
opened
and
the
outer
doors
can
not
be
kept
hermetically
sealed
and
the
moment
we
leave
our
fireside
or
the
rooms
where
we
have
fires
we
get
a
sudden
chill
which
can
not
fail
to
try
us
terribly
even
if
it
results
in
nothing
worse
besides
which
a
fearful
cold
draught
comes
into
our
the
moment
the
doors
are
open
and
we
shiver
and
throw
on
more
coal
coal
that
we
should
not
require
were
the
hall
warmed
as
it
ought
to
have
been
and
which
would
allow
us
to
even
leave
our
door
open
should
we
desire
to
do
so
now
our
first
exclamation
to
an
incoming
friend
is
please
shut
the
door
and
we
dismiss
him
or
her
with
the
same
pleasing
but
necessary
injunction
i
was
delighted
to
see
in
one
of
the
papers
the
other
day
that
there
had
been
a
most
remarkable
diminution
in
that
fatal
scourge
of
our
ancestresses
consumption
for
i
am
certain
this
is
entirely
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
far
more
sensible
about
our
clothing
and
much
more
lavish
about
firing
than
our
fathers
used
to
be
and
i
feel
convinced
were
we
to
have
still
more
fires
and
were
we
to
taboo

no

no

entirely
consumption
would
soon
be
a
thing
of
the
past
therefore
i
can
not
i
feel
say
too
much
about
the
necessity
for
a
stove
or
fire
in
the
hall
which
is
certainly
neither
complete
nor
sensible
without
this
most
necessary
piece
of
furniture
but
i
suppose
we
must
await
our
lady
architect
before
these
are
universal
or
before
we
get
a
really
perfect
house
from
a
point
of
view
at
least
the
furniture
of
the
hall
must
depend
entirely
on
its
length
and
breadth
but
once
more
i
beg
my
readers
not
to
allow
of
anything
approaching
the
appearance
of
the
ordinary
ugly
hat
stand
there
if
edwin
will
not
remove
his
hideous
hats
and
very
ugly
coats
upstairs
angelina
must
conciliate
him
by
having
one
of
the
hall
wardrobes
illustrated
here
the
first
one
could
go
into
a
corner
behind
the
door
and
could
be
painted
to
match
the
decorations
or
else
could
be
of
either
american
walnut
or
oak
the
curtains
could
be
of
serge
worked
over
in
a
decorative
design
in
coarse
crewels
or
else
of
some
pretty
tapestry
complete
in
art
colours
with
serge
curtains
it
costs
in
walnut
the
straight
one
costs
in
art
colours
and
in
walnut
but
for
the
impecunious
and
alas
there
are
many
among
us
a
piece
of
wood
could
be
put
into
the
corner
and
screwed
there
with
a
straight
piece
to
make
a
front
from
which
the
curtain
should
hang
down
straight
behind
this
a
shelf
could
be
placed
for
hats
and
some
hooks
could
be
screwed
on
the
wall
for
coats
but
if
in
any
way
possible
the
real
thing
should
be
bought
it
could
be
moved
to
any
other
house
and
would
last
a
these
designs
are
made
by
wallace
of
the
curtain
road
where
these
capital
hall
wardrobes
are
to
be
had
and
which
will
i
trust
strike
a
to
the
stands
which
were
as
ugly
as
they
were
temptations
to
the
ordinary
to
come
in
and
help
himself
to
any
coat
or
hat
he
takes
a
fancy
to
instead
of
the
ordinary
hall
table
i
again
suggest
the
buffet
illustrated
on
page
nothing
looks
better
and
if
a
carriage
is
kept
the
oak
chest
which
can
be
opened
like
a
cupboard
could
hold
the
rugs
while
the
top
could
be
ornamented
with
china
and
hold
a
big
imari
bowl
for
cards
and
a
smaller
one
for
the
cards
left
during
the
afternoon
or
letters
sent
by
post
a
couple
of
chairs
and
the
settle
spoken
of
before
would
be
ample
for
any
ordinary
hall
where
there
should
be
furthermore
a
good
mat
at
the
front
door
but
no
small
mats
in
each
doorway
or
dreadful
woolly
mats
about
things
which
are
quite
unnecessary
and
are
as
ugly
as
they
are
tiresome
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
whether
artistic
or
not
the
hall
should
be
scrupulously
tidy
and
as
scrupulously
clean
and
i
do
not
know
a
more
difficult
thing
than
to
insist
on
the
former
of
these
two
axioms
and
to
see
orders
are
carried
out
especially
when
there
are
boys
and
dogs
those
two
fatal
elements
to
tidiness
and
cleanliness
but
which
are
absolutely
necessary
to
the
making
of
a
complete
house
one
may
go
out
leaving
a
spotless
place
with
no
to
offend
the
eye
but
one
returns
to
find
it
scattered
over
with
hats
and
caps
tennis
rackets
bats
and
stumps
paw
and
footmarks
and
a
general
air
of
distracting
dirt
all
over
that
is
absolutely
trying
to
the
eye
that
fondly
hopes
to
see
what
it
left
and
the
only
way
to
cope
with
the
human
element
is
to
make
a
species
of
pound
into
which
all
is
put
and
from
whence
nothing
can
be
extracted
without
the
payment
of
some
small
fine
i
have
known
a
pocket
money
go
in
one
morning
but
as
a
rule
very
few
lessons
are
required
the
unfailing
exactment
of
a
fine
teaching
even
a
boy
that
there
is
a
place
for
everything
and
that
everything
must
be
put
in
that
place
the
dogs
and
footmarks
have
to
be
put
up
with
and
i
have
known
an
unhappy
kitchenmaid
wash
the
front
doorsteps
five
single
times
in
one
day
when
the
boys
have
been
at
home
and
rain
has
as
is
usual
in
watford
been
falling
dismally
a
back
staircase
is
another
thing
no
house
should
be
built
without
this
spares
the
hall
immensely
and
saves
the
best
and
prevents
one
meeting
the
servants
as
one
goes
up
and
down
a
thing
i
personally
very
much
object
to
i
know
why
but
i
resent
hearing
them
go
up
to
bed
past
the
door
and
owe
our
present
house
yet
another
grudge
because
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
we
have
here
no
second
staircase
if
there
should
be
one
i
again
advise
the
oilcloth
dado
spoken
of
in
my
former
book
nothing
is
so
absolutely
indestructible
or
so
clean
and
with
this
dado
a
wall
would
remain
tidy
and
spotless
for
an
entire
lifetime
a
strong
cocoanut
matting
should
be
put
down
on
the
stairs
themselves
but
the
edges
of
the
stairs
should
be
carefully
inspected
as
back
stairs
especially
are
apt
to
be
very
roughly
finished
off
if
this
is
the
case
a
carpenter
should
be
called
in
either
to
plane
them
smoothly
or
mend
them
or
a
wide
broad
piece
of
brass
should
bind
the
edges
these
again
should
have
a
pad
of
flock
in
a
thin
lining
laid
along
them
finally
covered
with
the
cocoanut
matting
these
small
precautions
will
not
cost
very
much
but
will
certainly
add
immensely
to
the
chances
of
the
longevity
of
the
carpets
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
the
of
the
back
stairs
grained
and
varnished
but
those
in
the
principal
staircase
should
always
be
painted
white
with
this
gives
an
indescribably
clean
and
fresh
look
to
the
stairs
and
the
paint
is
so
easily
applied
that
the
housemaid
could
do
it
herself
yearly
or
whenever
an
opportunity
offers
to
the
treads
housekeepers
should
in
my
opinion
raise
a
statue
to
aspinall
for
he
certainly
has
removed
the
difficulties
that
lay
in
wait
for
the
artistic
mistress
of
the
household
for
now
she
is
rendered
quite
independent
of
the
british
workman
and
can
either
paint
her
house
herself
or
give
it
to
a
man
who
can
be
trusted
to
apply
the
paint
albeit
no
amount
of
instruction
will
teach
him
to
match
a
colour
or
produce
anything
save
a
hideous
caricature
of
the
paper
we
give
him
and
whose
is
absolutely
incapable
of
seeing
what
a
ridiculous
muddle
he
is
making
and
i
therefore
can
not
too
often
impress
upon
my
readers
especially
on
those
who
live
far
from
really
artistic
workpeople
that
if
they
want
their
houses
to
be
really
nice
they
must
indulge
in
aspinall
and
must
insist
on
the
unbroken
surface
of
paint
that
use
of
this
most
invaluable
enamel
produces
most
satisfactorily
chapter
iii
nooks
and
corners
i
think
so
very
much
of
the
appearance
of
our
rooms
depends
on
how
we
arrange
our
corners
that
i
have
had
two
large
drawings
made
from
corners
in
my
present
house
which
at
the
risk
of
appearing
egotistical
i
am
going
to
write
about
not
because
i
consider
them
perfect
no
house
can
really
be
perfect
unless
far
more
money
is
spent
upon
it
than
i
am
able
to
spend
but
because
i
consider
they
will
in
some
measure
assist
those
who
like
myself
are
very
fond
of
pretty
and
comfortable
things
but
are
not
prepared
to
ruin
themselves
in
order
to
obtain
this
most
desirable
combination
i
wrote
so
fully
in
my
former
book
on
the
arrangement
of
that
i
am
only
going
to
touch
lightly
on
the
orthodox
papering
and
painting
of
and
reserving
all
my
new
ideas
for
the
and
library
neither
of
which
rooms
were
considered
likely
to
be
required
for
the
modest
young
couple
starting
in
life
for
whom
i
more
particularly
designed
that
special
volume
as
i
said
before
this
book
is
intended
for
older
folks
or
for
those
who
have
more
of
this
goods
than
edwin
and
angelina
were
supposed
to
possess
and
therefore
it
really
supplements
it
does
not
in
any
measure
do
away
with
kitchen
to
garret
and
as
i
am
most
anxious
to
impress
this
upon
my
readers
by
not
repeating
any
of
the
information
i
gave
there
i
intend
especially
in
the
present
chapter
to
denote
how
with
a
little
care
the
modest
house
can
be
expanded
into
a
more
artistic
abode
or
how
a
bigger
house
can
be
furnished
the
while
we
do
not
set
on
one
side
the
furniture
with
which
we
began
life
and
which
we
possessed
ourselves
of
with
so
much
gladness
and
with
such
a
sense
of
importance
at
least
i
hope
all
my
readers
did
for
the
culture
of
home
and
of
all
that
makes
a
home
can
not
in
my
opinion
be
too
much
developed
therefore
from
their
earliest
days
children
should
be
encouraged
to
think
about
their
own
special
rooms
and
should
be
taught
to
notice
and
have
a
voice
in
the
arrangement
of
all
the
house
if
the
house
is
thoroughly
appreciated
and
cultivated
if
above
all
it
is
the
prettiest
and
happiest
place
our
children
know
of
we
shall
not
have
much
difficulty
with
them
when
they
cease
to
be
children
and
begin
to
feel
they
have
a
separate
existence
to
ours
they
have
this
separate
existence
and
we
should
endeavour
that
without
in
any
measure
relaxing
the
ties
of
duty
and
politeness
they
should
be
able
to
feel
they
are
themselves
and
not
our
and
this
can
only
be
done
by
consulting
and
talking
with
them
freely
about
all
we
have
and
do
letting
them
if
they
will
develop
their
own
tastes
gradually
but
not
in
a
manner
that
will
oust
us
from
our
proper
place
or
jar
with
any
of
our
own
pet
ideas
on
the
subject
of
home
and
its
decoration
and
embellishment
for
it
is
better
to
endure
the
ugliest
place
in
the
world
cheerfully
than
to
live
in
artistic
completeness
if
this
same
artistic
completeness
means
sweeping
away
all
the
landmarks
of
our
elders
and
betters
and
leaving
them
stranded
in
an
unfamiliar
world
of
new
tables
and
chairs
which
are
nothing
to
them
and
but
ill
replace
the
furniture
which
reminds
them
of
so
much
that
we
never
knew
about
or
have
entirely
forgotten
i
have
known
a
girl
in
her
zeal
for
beauty
make
her
mother
so
abjectly
miserable
by
removing
a
round
table
once
the
centre
of
the
scattered
houseful
of
boys
and
girls
and
by
ruthlessly
disposing
of
clumsy
and
hideous
furniture
made
precious
by
memories
of
those
who
have
gone
into
the
land
of
shadows
that
i
am
compelled
at
times
to
allow
sentiment
to
sway
me
and
to
say
consider
first
whether
a
thing
has
associations
before
in
anxiety
for
beauty
one
does
away
with
it
if
it
have
let
it
remain
for
nothing
can
ever
replace
it
but
if
it
have
not
and
i
sternly
myself
refuse
to
become
sentimental
over
a
chair
or
footstool
by
all
means
get
rid
of
it
and
replace
it
with
something
lighter
and
more
modern
as
a
rule
this
will
not
last
long
enough
for
us
to
cling
round
it
mentally
or
to
deck
it
with
any
of
the
finer
sentiment
that
is
inseparable
from
much
of
the
heavy
mahogany
and
walnut
under
which
so
many
of
my
disciples
still
groan
and
which
has
been
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
each
generation
becoming
more
and
more
discontented
with
it
until
the
present
are
in
open
revolt
against
that
which
gave
our
grandmothers
and
the
greatest
possible
gratification
to
possess
the
pretty
corners
in
which
we
all
delight
and
the
lightness
and
brightness
that
now
characterise
our
houses
would
have
been
the
source
of
endless
woe
and
trouble
to
the
dear
ladies
of
old
the
corners
would
have
meant
dust
and
and
as
the
light
colours
in
which
we
revel
would
and
do
soon
become
soiled
they
too
would
have
been
deprecated
because
they
showed
the
dirt
which
was
present
equally
in
the
darker
rooms
but
not
being
visible
was
not
taken
any
notice
of
until
the
annual
clean
when
all
was
made
aggressively
shining
and
absolutely
spotless
remaining
so
for
about
a
week
when
dust
began
to
gather
again
but
it
was
unnoticed
because
the
dark
materials
did
not
show
the
dirt
which
however
could
be
felt
did
our
finger
come
in
contact
with
the
rough
moreen
or
dismal
repps
in
which
their
souls
delighted
and
of
which
specimens
still
haunt
us
in
the
houses
of
those
who
are
possessors
of
similar
heirlooms
with
which
they
dare
not
part
then
too
the
dear
ladies
were
so
fond
of
stuffing
up
their
windows
and
darkening
their
rooms
still
more
by
the
drawing
down
of
blinds
and
the
eliminating
of
every
morsel
of
sunshine
for
fear
their
precious
carpets
would
become
faded
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
this
affection
for
rooms
yet
lingers
among
many
who
ought
to
know
better
but
when
i
stumble
into
one
of
these
rooms
where
one
cannonades
against
the
furniture
and
falls
over
footstools
in
the
i
always
feel
convinced
that
the
blinds
are
drawn
to
prevent
the
sun
beating
too
warmly
on
the
faded
complexion
of
the
owner
of
that
house
or
to
hide
the
ravages
of
time
that
the
liberally
applied
and
rouge
and
the
sticky
harsh
dye
are
powerless
to
remove
entirely
but
that
almost
disappear
in
the
chambers
i
so
abhor
and
despise
and
i
therefore
know
what
to
expect
when
i
am
ushered
into
one
of
these
stuffy
dismal
rooms
and
am
thankful
when
i
get
out
of
it
for
the
mind
that
can
delight
in
defying
age
with
paint
and
dye
is
not
likely
to
find
me
of
the
smallest
use
i
should
say
at
once
do
away
with
the
blinds
and
shorten
the
curtains
and
let
in
some
air
and
as
the
owner
of
that
house
would
sooner
dye
i
mean
die
than
accede
to
my
request
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
and
get
away
as
soon
as
i
can
any
amount
of
decoration
for
the
house
i
like
and
appreciate
but
i
can
not
appreciate
or
understand
the
ambition
that
makes
one
aspinall
face
and
pretend
to
be
when
one
knows
one
will
never
see
forty
again
corners
are
especially
appreciated
unfortunately
by
the
ladies
who
draw
their
blinds
down
and
never
face
the
eye
of
day
save
in
a
carriage
with
a
spotted
veil
over
their
features
and
a
shading
parasol
and
no
doubt
some
of
these
individuals
will
look
at
the
pictures
in
this
book
and
may
see
these
words
of
wisdom
if
they
do
i
hope
they
will
consider
them
wash
their
faces
and
pull
up
their
blinds
i
can
assure
them
they
will
be
far
happier
and
healthier
more
especially
if
they
realise
that
the
time
they
spend
in
tiring
their
heads
and
painting
their
faces
is
absolutely
wasted
it
neither
makes
them
younger
nor
more
ornamental
and
that
it
would
be
far
better
employed
in
working
for
others
or
in
making
their
homes
as
cheerful
as
unfailing
sunshine
and
fresh
air
invariably
do
therefore
down
with
the
curtains
and
up
with
the
blinds
and
let
us
have
as
much
cheerful
sunshine
as
this
rather
disappointing
climate
will
allow
us
to
possess
and
the
first
corner
i
would
make
is
the
summer
corner
for
that
once
made
dismal
darkness
and
stuffiness
would
be
an
impossibility
the
special
corner
illustrated
here
is
one
of
the
windows
in
my
present
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
room
in
a
curious
species
of
square
nook
to
itself
there
is
an
enormous
species
of
beside
where
i
have
my
desk
and
other
belongings
and
beyond
that
again
is
a
third
window
below
which
i
have
a
long
full
of
books
but
though
this
window
is
to
some
extent
unique
the
seat
illustrated
here
which
is
an
adaptation
or
rather
an
enlargement
of
corner
could
be
put
under
any
window
and
of
course
enlarged
immensely
if
desired
it
could
go
across
one
side
of
the
room
and
the
arm
with
a
curtain
could
come
out
straight
from
the
wall
of
the
room
thus
making
a
sheltered
place
in
which
to
sit
and
read
and
breaking
up
admirably
the
long
straight
look
of
the
wall
which
all
too
often
makes
an
ordinary
room
the
most
uninteresting
place
in
the
world
and
the
most
difficult
to
render
artistic
and
pleasant
the
side
of
the
seat
should
be
at
least
two
feet
longer
than
the
side
or
else
the
seat
will
look
too
much
like
a
family
pew
which
cognomen
one
of
my
friends
is
rude
enough
to
give
to
my
present
seat
but
arranged
with
the
ends
of
an
uneven
length
the
seat
looks
like
nothing
save
what
it
is
a
remarkably
comfortable
lounge
where
one
can
either
sit
and
read
or
talk
and
it
forms
an
extremely
pretty
addition
to
any
room
the
special
seat
illustrated
here
is
enamelled
electric
turquoise
and
is
upholstered
in
yellow
and
white
louis
xvi
damask
at
a
yard
but
i
intend
soon
to
replace
this
covering
by
dark
yellow
stamped
illustration
fig
a
summer
corner
corduroy
velveteen
for
pretty
as
the
louis
xvi
damask
is
and
admirable
as
it
is
for
curtains
and
it
does
not
answer
for
hard
wear
and
soon
becomes
soiled
and
rubbed
a
fact
giles
warned
me
about
but
i
was
anxious
to
experiment
myself
on
the
subject
and
having
done
so
and
found
it
does
not
answer
here
solemnly
warn
my
readers
from
using
this
charming
material
for
tight
coverings
or
where
real
hard
wear
is
expected
of
it
tightly
upholstered
furniture
should
be
always
covered
in
something
that
will
really
wear
not
only
because
of
the
expense
but
because
of
the
worry
of
having
workmen
always
in
the
house
replacing
the
furniture
which
has
become
soiled
and
worn
but
whatever
the
seat
is
upholstered
in
the
fringe
round
the
seat
should
not
be
forgotten
and
it
should
almost
touch
the
ground
mine
does
not
and
in
consequence
the
seat
always
has
the
appearance
of
having
grown
out
of
its
frocks
and
the
material
should
be
in
some
measure
a
contrast
to
the
colour
used
for
enamelling
the
ends
and
woodwork
indeed
i
much
prefer
the
ends
to
be
of
some
polished
wood
while
the
straight
piece
above
the
seat
and
below
the
shelf
could
be
either
plainly
painted
or
polished
wood
or
else
it
could
be
made
of
brocade
or
japanese
leather
paper
giles
puts
lincrusta
in
those
he
sells
to
fit
into
recesses
but
i
can
not
endure
this
stiff
and
very
ugly
material
and
always
ask
him
to
replace
it
for
me
with
something
preferable
the
excellent
japanese
leather
looking
better
in
my
opinion
than
anything
else
the
straight
piece
above
the
seat
if
covered
in
brocade
and
furnished
with
tiny
hooks
would
make
an
admirable
place
to
display
the
miniatures
and
odds
and
ends
of
silver
that
are
so
fashionable
really
old
and
valuable
fans
could
also
be
displayed
here
to
advantage
and
a
thin
sheet
of
talc
could
be
stretched
over
all
glass
would
be
too
heavy
and
the
talc
would
protect
the
fans
from
dust
and
yet
be
sufficiently
transparent
the
shelf
for
china
is
part
of
the
seat
this
is
of
wood
either
enamelled
or
polished
and
should
be
carefully
arranged
the
tall
jar
containing
grasses
at
the
end
of
the
shelf
in
the
sketch
is
really
in
the
corner
in
my
room
and
fills
up
the
space
between
the
curtain
and
the
wall
and
in
the
opposite
corner
from
the
hangs
one
of
admirable
copper
lamps
with
a
copper
shade
this
throws
the
light
down
on
the
seat
and
enables
one
to
read
there
should
one
wish
to
do
so
the
cushioned
corner
below
the
lamp
being
perhaps
the
most
comfortable
spot
in
the
whole
seat
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
arms
and
below
the
top
of
them
i
had
small
shelves
put
they
shut
down
completely
and
when
not
in
use
are
scarcely
visible
but
they
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
comfort
for
one
can
rest
cup
there
easily
and
in
consequence
this
corner
makes
a
favourite
spot
during
the
ceremony
of
afternoon
tea
which
we
always
hold
in
the
our
present
being
only
used
when
lighted
up
as
it
is
dark
and
depressing
because
of
the
numerous
trees
by
which
we
are
surrounded
and
that
make
it
unbearable
until
the
lamps
are
lighted
and
the
yellow
and
white
decoration
stands
out
in
the
admirable
manner
in
which
these
two
colours
always
do
when
once
artificial
light
falls
upon
them
the
big
pillows
are
in
yellow
and
electric
turquoise
and
were
bought
at
for
each
but
those
who
really
possess
numerous
pillows
soft
and
comfortable
enough
to
lean
against
but
hideous
to
contemplate
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
maple
sells
these
frilled
silk
covers
ready
to
slip
on
which
would
transform
in
a
moment
the
most
frightful
pillow
ever
presented
to
an
unfortunate
bride
who
yet
dare
not
do
away
with
the
kind
gift
of
a
relative
who
may
be
has
not
gone
with
the
times
or
holds
the
stern
opinion
that
a
gift
one
makes
oneself
is
worth
any
amount
of
presents
bought
in
a
shop
so
it
is
if
the
work
be
present
day
work
and
really
artistic
but
the
beaded
cushion
or
the
worst
development
of
all
that
covered
with
crazy
patchwork
still
exists
unfortunately
and
may
exist
blamelessly
and
usefully
if
slipped
into
one
of
these
covers
which
can
be
whipped
off
in
a
moment
should
the
donor
appear
unexpectedly
or
be
even
pointed
out
as
our
pious
endeavour
to
preserve
the
work
by
a
cover
one
does
not
mind
if
one
spoils
an
excellently
plausible
excuse
that
spares
the
feelings
of
the
maker
and
our
own
sensitive
optics
at
the
same
time
the
curtain
on
my
seat
is
hanging
on
a
brass
rod
and
is
made
from
a
remarkably
beautiful
pattern
of
yellow
and
brown
stamped
velveteen
known
as
the
graham
velveteen
and
sold
by
graham
biddle
both
sides
of
the
curtain
are
alike
as
i
have
doubled
the
material
and
i
am
very
fond
of
this
special
bit
of
colour
and
design
but
if
the
velveteen
is
objected
to
the
curtain
can
be
made
from
the
soft
artistic
silk
shoolbred
sells
at
a
yard
this
must
be
double
too
and
put
on
very
full
or
else
it
will
soon
become
skimpy
and
flabby
the
table
at
the
end
of
the
seat
has
a
loose
cover
of
bokhara
plush
a
capital
species
of
ribbed
plush
edged
with
ball
fringe
this
costs
a
yard
from
colbourne
and
it
takes
a
yard
and
a
quarter
to
make
the
square
which
is
necessary
for
one
of
these
cloths
a
big
yellow
pot
holding
a
palm
stands
on
the
table
the
palm
giving
place
whenever
possible
to
a
flowering
plant
a
great
white
azalea
and
a
big
white
rose
tree
and
also
an
orange
tree
with
flowers
and
fruit
and
a
flowering
daphne
having
all
appeared
there
to
the
greatest
possible
advantage
beyond
the
curtain
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
seat
i
hang
a
long
japanese
bamboo
and
have
flowers
here
whenever
possible
these
bamboos
are
most
decorative
and
look
nice
with
comparatively
few
flowers
in
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
seat
at
the
end
a
palm
stands
on
the
low
square
stools
i
prefer
to
anything
else
for
pot
stands
and
at
the
extreme
end
i
always
have
one
of
admirable
newspaper
and
magazine
stands
these
are
the
right
height
for
use
and
stand
on
two
crossed
legs
one
side
takes
papers
and
the
other
magazines
a
is
slipped
into
a
bracket
at
the
side
and
altogether
the
stand
is
a
wonderful
comfort
and
above
all
makes
an
excellent
present
for
a
man
that
most
difficult
of
all
creatures
to
give
a
present
to
unless
one
half
ruin
oneself
in
order
to
make
him
an
offering
the
walls
of
this
special
room
are
covered
with
admirable
blue
paper
at
the
piece
all
the
paint
is
enamel
the
frieze
is
plain
gold
japanese
leather
paper
and
the
ceiling
is
in
squares
the
moulding
that
forms
each
square
is
coloured
cream
and
the
squares
themselves
are
filled
in
with
a
yellow
and
white
ceiling
paper
from
at
a
piece
the
floor
is
covered
with
yellow
and
white
matting
and
has
several
rugs
lying
about
and
the
curtains
are
louis
xvi
tapestry
in
yellow
and
white
edged
with
the
usual
ball
fringe
the
smaller
windows
having
this
only
the
larger
one
having
on
it
as
well
the
frieze
has
been
embellished
most
successfully
in
three
or
four
places
with
great
branches
of
japonica
in
the
natural
colours
and
this
is
an
immense
improvement
as
one
requires
touches
of
red
undoubtedly
about
the
room
the
branches
do
not
go
all
round
the
room
in
the
orthodox
manner
but
are
scattered
in
three
or
four
places
and
are
the
work
of
an
artist
a
good
effect
can
be
obtained
by
merely
outlining
with
a
careful
brush
the
patterns
that
are
on
all
japanese
leather
papers
with
a
little
of
course
this
must
not
be
done
all
over
the
frieze
but
simply
here
and
there
and
should
be
executed
with
taste
and
a
great
amount
of
common
sense
as
well
before
i
say
any
more
about
this
room
or
about
the
other
corner
which
has
been
arranged
for
winter
use
i
want
to
draw
the
attention
of
my
readers
especially
to
the
windows
my
plan
of
doing
away
with
blinds
was
illustrated
as
regards
a
bow
window
and
the
tiny
squares
of
the
manor
house
windows
before
but
no
one
has
ever
seemed
able
to
grasp
the
manner
in
which
an
ordinary
flat
window
or
a
french
window
can
be
managed
this
window
is
the
ordinary
flat
window
and
can
anything
be
simpler
than
the
white
curtains
of
stretched
on
two
slight
rods
fastened
on
the
window
not
on
the
these
curtains
remain
in
place
whether
the
window
is
open
or
shut
and
in
consequence
were
they
used
in
a
bedroom
one
could
dress
comfortably
with
the
window
open
the
curtains
remaining
in
place
and
serving
as
a
blind
with
the
ordinary
short
blind
which
vulgarises
any
house
and
to
which
english
cling
with
a
devotion
worthy
of
a
better
cause
one
must
keep
the
windows
closed
during
the
process
of
dressing
as
the
blind
goes
up
with
the
window
and
leaves
the
room
exposed
to
the
glances
of
anyone
who
may
be
passing
by
the
thicker
curtains
hang
from
a
separate
brass
rod
which
is
rather
larger
than
those
used
for
the
muslin
these
curtains
are
attached
to
rings
which
allow
them
to
be
drawn
easily
along
the
rods
at
night
and
when
the
sun
shines
too
warmly
and
brightly
and
therefore
no
hideously
ugly
blinds
are
required
for
even
ladies
whose
dubious
complexions
forbid
the
free
entrance
of
the
blessed
sun
can
make
their
rooms
as
dark
as
they
like
by
drawing
these
curtains
which
can
be
lined
with
a
thick
sateen
and
should
be
edged
with
a
ball
fringe
to
break
the
hard
line
which
always
spoils
the
look
of
any
curtain
when
left
untrimmed
vitrage
which
is
to
be
had
from
wallace
from
a
yard
makes
admirable
under
curtains
of
course
it
is
much
dearer
than
butter
muslin
or
his
indian
muslin
at
a
yard
but
then
these
muslins
require
making
up
and
must
be
edged
with
softly
falling
frills
which
should
be
from
to
inches
in
width
according
to
the
size
of
the
window
these
frills
are
put
on
without
any
heading
and
fall
in
a
sort
of
cascade
the
frilled
muslins
sold
now
by
the
yard
at
any
big
shop
are
not
nearly
so
satisfactory
as
the
frills
are
goffered
and
are
very
stiff
making
the
frilled
curtains
is
a
serious
consideration
they
must
be
done
by
hand
as
the
muslin
will
not
stand
the
machine
and
the
hemming
required
is
rather
hard
work
and
therefore
vitrage
despite
its
price
should
recommend
itself
to
those
who
are
not
given
to
sewing
it
merely
requires
hemming
top
and
bottom
and
the
rods
pass
through
these
hems
which
should
be
loose
enough
to
allow
of
the
curtain
being
moved
to
cover
the
window
entirely
should
this
be
necessary
or
to
part
in
the
centre
so
that
any
view
there
may
be
need
not
be
obscured
in
the
ordinary
london
house
where
all
sorts
of
endeavours
are
made
to
completely
hide
the
doings
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
rooms
from
the
these
curtains
especially
in
the
indian
muslin
from
are
invaluable
no
one
can
see
in
and
all
can
see
out
while
further
protection
could
be
obtained
by
flower
boxes
along
the
in
the
summer
and
put
inside
the
rooms
in
the
winter
if
desired
a
couple
of
iron
brackets
could
be
put
out
one
each
side
of
the
window
aspinalled
to
match
the
rest
of
the
paint
and
on
this
the
box
could
rest
full
of
flowering
plants
when
the
weather
outside
would
be
too
cold
for
them
to
live
and
flourish
the
whole
of
the
house
should
be
done
alike
with
the
curtains
of
which
a
double
set
should
be
made
the
must
not
be
very
much
starched
and
it
must
be
carefully
pulled
out
and
stretched
before
it
is
quite
dry
or
else
it
will
seem
to
have
shrunk
but
with
care
and
proper
washing
these
curtains
would
last
three
or
four
years
and
as
there
is
no
real
trouble
in
making
should
soon
be
the
favourite
material
for
these
short
curtains
the
cost
would
be
about
a
window
so
that
it
would
be
easy
for
anyone
to
see
what
their
house
would
cost
them
naturally
the
other
muslin
would
come
only
to
about
a
window
in
this
case
the
sewing
must
be
done
by
the
owner
of
the
house
or
her
maids
i
think
from
this
sketch
anyone
can
see
how
the
ordinary
blindless
window
is
managed
while
the
way
to
arrange
a
french
window
is
shown
in
the
frontispiece
so
plainly
that
no
further
description
can
possibly
be
needed
and
now
we
come
to
the
winter
corner
the
sketch
of
which
requires
very
little
comment
from
me
as
i
think
it
speaks
for
itself
but
my
readers
may
be
interested
to
know
that
the
sofa
illustrated
here
began
life
as
a
wretched
stiff
sofa
with
a
scroll
end
and
no
side
whatever
and
was
bought
very
cheaply
of
a
country
tradesman
when
i
wanted
to
make
a
comfortable
seat
by
the
fire
i
got
another
local
genius
to
put
the
scroll
end
upright
and
to
put
on
the
side
this
transformed
the
seat
at
once
and
made
a
most
comfortable
lounge
more
especially
as
i
had
the
legs
cut
down
until
it
is
only
fourteen
inches
high
the
seat
being
about
inches
wide
this
is
a
seat
et
but
by
putting
a
couple
of
pillows
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
nearest
the
wall
and
stuffing
them
comfortably
down
there
one
makes
an
excellent
rest
for
head
and
can
lie
there
in
warmth
and
peace
this
corner
by
the
way
is
a
special
favourite
of
max
the
tabby
cat
who
much
resents
being
moved
therefrom
and
retreats
in
great
dudgeon
to
a
chair
from
liberty
which
stands
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
which
is
only
just
indicated
in
the
sketch
and
which
is
a
charming
but
simple
design
from
shuffery
in
welbeck
street
behind
the
sofa
stands
the
corner
cabinet
made
for
me
by
smee
and
which
is
just
what
such
a
cabinet
ought
to
be
i
have
seen
a
corner
cabinet
which
looked
as
if
its
middle
had
suddenly
collapsed
the
two
sides
going
into
a
miserable
point
which
was
as
ugly
as
it
was
unsatisfactory
and
i
could
not
think
what
was
the
matter
with
it
until
i
discovered
that
the
point
ought
to
have
been
behind
and
that
the
front
should
be
comparatively
straight
as
in
our
illustration
this
cabinet
is
enamelled
electric
illustration
fig
a
winter
corner
turquoise
and
has
brass
handles
to
the
drawers
and
cupboard
which
are
made
for
use
and
hold
an
immense
variety
of
things
the
drawers
are
divided
in
half
inside
which
is
a
great
convenience
as
it
enables
one
to
keep
papers
and
properties
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
separate
and
distinct
while
the
cupboard
also
has
a
shelf
in
it
and
is
the
whole
length
and
width
of
the
bottom
part
thus
holding
a
good
deal
the
two
little
velveteen
curtains
are
to
break
the
monotony
which
would
have
been
caused
had
the
shelves
been
left
open
and
the
top
and
shelves
generally
hold
any
quantity
of
china
the
dull
yellow
and
blue
jars
one
buys
at
being
especially
suitable
for
this
room
as
is
the
deep
red
kaga
and
imari
ware
imported
in
such
quantities
by
shoolbred
liberty
and
whiteley
and
indeed
by
almost
every
second
shop
nowadays
the
table
shown
in
this
illustration
is
one
that
is
remarkably
useful
by
reason
of
its
second
tray
my
own
table
is
covered
in
dull
yellow
corduroy
velveteen
edged
with
a
ball
fringe
but
if
room
were
a
great
object
and
there
were
much
to
store
away
a
loose
in
serge
or
bokhara
plush
could
be
thrown
over
it
to
conceal
anything
that
was
hidden
thereunder
i
am
not
fond
of
these
makeshifts
myself
but
in
a
small
room
where
every
single
inch
is
of
consequence
work
that
would
be
perhaps
unsightly
to
leave
about
can
be
neatly
folded
and
put
on
this
tray
and
another
place
to
put
away
could
be
afforded
if
we
replaced
my
fireside
sofa
which
wallace
will
supply
at
complete
by
a
sofa
i
saw
at
just
lately
this
is
an
improvement
on
the
very
useful
i
advocate
in
many
bedrooms
and
is
much
like
a
sofa
with
a
tolerably
high
side
and
two
ends
the
top
of
the
sofa
lifts
up
and
discloses
a
good
deep
box
which
would
hold
an
immense
quantity
of
things
while
the
whole
affair
does
not
look
like
a
but
resembles
a
very
comfortable
and
pretty
sofa
this
costs
about
and
would
be
of
immense
use
in
a
room
where
one
had
a
great
deal
to
put
away
and
very
few
convenient
places
to
store
property
in
this
would
stand
where
my
sofa
is
in
the
sketch
or
could
be
put
in
a
recess
one
side
of
the
fire
it
would
look
well
in
either
situation
i
think
this
corner
too
gives
some
idea
of
how
pictures
can
be
hung
about
in
an
informal
manner
although
in
every
case
these
are
represented
in
the
sketch
as
being
much
higher
than
they
really
are
there
is
no
formal
arrangement
yet
all
seems
to
fall
into
place
without
trouble
and
the
whole
effect
is
very
good
flowers
and
plants
are
again
to
be
found
here
and
indeed
i
can
not
say
too
much
about
the
desirability
of
filling
our
rooms
with
both
plants
and
flowers
no
house
can
be
pretty
without
a
great
many
of
both
and
no
one
who
has
not
seen
the
immense
difference
plenty
of
plants
make
can
have
any
idea
of
the
satisfactory
effect
of
these
great
adjuncts
to
the
real
decoration
of
a
house
they
cost
money
but
not
one
quarter
of
what
they
used
to
and
even
in
the
depth
of
winter
in
london
one
can
buy
heaps
of
narcissus
and
jonquils
absurdly
cheaply
a
shillingsworth
making
an
appreciable
difference
in
any
house
beyond
the
chair
just
indicated
in
the
sketch
is
a
species
of
square
arch
and
beyond
that
a
square
end
to
the
room
itself
i
did
not
at
first
see
what
i
could
do
with
this
most
ugly
part
of
an
ugly
room
but
at
last
the
brilliant
idea
struck
me
of
which
i
give
a
tiny
sketch
here
i
had
a
series
of
brackets
put
up
the
arch
to
hold
china
the
back
of
these
brackets
and
the
panelling
above
the
arch
itself
was
filled
in
with
red
and
gold
japanese
leather
paper
and
on
each
bracket
i
placed
one
of
pots
the
sides
of
the
brackets
were
painted
by
clever
brush
with
red
yellow
and
pink
roses
and
i
at
once
found
myself
in
possession
of
a
charming
object
for
contemplation
instead
of
a
yawning
gap
preposterous
in
structure
and
hideous
to
look
at
by
the
side
of
the
arch
i
place
a
beautifully
embroidered
japanese
silk
screen
in
the
most
delicate
shade
of
pink
i
can
dwell
lovingly
on
this
as
it
was
not
my
own
selection
but
was
a
christmas
present
from
someone
who
knew
and
studied
my
tastes
and
it
gives
just
the
right
finish
to
that
corner
behind
the
last
bracket
stands
a
palm
in
an
and
another
little
table
with
a
blue
cloth
is
in
front
of
the
screen
and
completes
that
side
of
the
room
below
the
last
window
is
the
long
low
mentioned
before
it
is
only
about
three
feet
high
and
is
enamelled
electric
turquoise
like
the
rest
of
the
room
and
each
shelf
is
edged
with
a
frill
of
yellow
printed
linen
the
top
of
these
shelves
makes
an
excellent
rest
for
photographs
china
and
plants
and
is
thus
finished
had
the
not
been
placed
there
i
can
not
think
what
i
should
have
done
as
no
one
can
sit
in
that
part
of
the
room
which
really
is
a
tiny
or
entrance
merely
to
what
is
not
at
the
best
a
large
room
but
which
would
have
been
all
the
better
had
the
eccentric
designer
done
away
with
his
arch
and
put
all
the
space
at
his
command
into
the
room
itself
but
he
did
not
and
so
i
have
made
the
best
use
i
can
of
the
room
as
it
is
though
i
really
believe
in
so
doing
i
have
shortened
my
life
perceptibly
illustration
fig
arches
for
a
double
room
at
the
end
of
the
room
opposite
the
window
under
which
the
is
is
a
door
and
such
a
door
when
we
came
it
was
grained
maple
and
was
the
centre
of
a
wooden
partition
above
which
was
a
neat
fanlight
of
starred
glass
i
shall
never
forget
it
never
i
have
now
put
on
each
side
of
the
door
a
curtain
of
brocade
and
another
on
the
door
itself
on
one
of
rods
which
open
and
shut
with
the
door
above
this
there
is
a
shelf
to
hold
china
and
the
glass
is
replaced
by
leaded
squares
of
cathedral
glass
i
mention
all
these
details
to
show
what
a
difference
a
small
amount
of
common
sense
a
little
woodwork
and
a
little
money
will
make
indeed
in
these
days
of
artistic
merit
when
upholsterers
are
educated
gentlemen
and
the
shop
is
no
longer
a
badge
of
infamy
i
think
no
one
who
is
not
utterly
obstinate
and
tasteless
need
have
an
ugly
house
though
i
must
confess
i
still
have
to
grieve
over
the
many
absolutely
hideous
houses
in
the
land
arranged
by
those
who
are
not
tasteless
i
wish
they
were
then
one
could
do
something
with
them
but
are
so
permeated
by
vile
and
vulgar
tastes
of
their
own
that
they
will
not
be
taught
and
continue
to
offend
our
eyes
with
their
belongings
regardless
of
the
fact
that
in
these
days
it
is
really
easier
to
have
pretty
things
than
to
have
ugly
ones
before
i
pass
on
to
other
nooks
and
corners
which
can
be
made
i
should
like
once
more
to
impress
upon
my
readers
that
for
a
nothing
is
so
absolutely
successful
as
regards
decoration
as
this
arrangement
of
yellow
and
red
i
have
sat
in
it
and
contemplated
it
for
just
seven
years
and
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
nothing
else
is
so
entirely
satisfactory
in
every
way
naturally
we
need
not
adhere
to
paper
or
there
would
be
too
much
monotony
about
it
marigold
at
from
morris
is
just
as
beautiful
while
less
expensive
and
papers
which
average
a
piece
can
all
be
used
according
to
the
size
and
shape
of
the
room
and
once
more
i
should
say
most
emphatically
study
your
room
a
dark
dull
room
could
not
take
this
scheme
of
blue
and
were
such
a
chamber
taken
for
the
which
i
hope
and
trust
would
not
be
the
case
i
should
advocate
another
scheme
of
colouring
altogether
and
would
suggest
either
a
really
beautiful
pink
and
green
floral
paper
called
at
the
piece
from
wallace
or
else
paper
at
with
either
i
should
suggest
warm
ivory
paint
a
pink
and
cream
ceiling
paper
and
either
cretonne
curtains
in
a
cretonne
to
harmonise
with
the
paper
or
else
of
soft
green
liberty
silk
the
greens
procurable
there
being
the
greens
to
harmonise
with
pink
liberty
pink
and
green
commingled
making
a
most
charming
room
but
one
that
should
not
be
attempted
cheaply
green
and
pink
must
be
in
expensive
materials
to
procure
the
proper
shades
a
common
green
and
an
inferior
pink
being
about
the
most
terrible
colours
one
can
have
although
a
common
blue
runs
it
very
hard
as
sporting
individuals
would
say
a
green
carpet
either
the
green
that
always
satisfactory
inexpensive
carpet
from
wallace
sold
in
blues
greens
and
reds
at
a
yard
wide
width
or
else
a
dull
green
pile
carpet
from
should
be
used
in
a
room
decorated
in
this
manner
but
the
green
must
be
an
artistic
green
and
have
no
fidgety
pattern
to
distract
the
eye
or
attract
attention
to
what
we
should
never
see
unless
our
attention
were
really
called
to
it
if
the
were
in
the
country
were
a
very
hot
room
and
only
used
in
summer
it
would
look
very
charming
in
and
white
morris
has
a
beautiful
paper
at
and
chappell
payne
have
a
very
pretty
and
paper
at
a
little
under
the
same
colour
which
could
be
used
were
morris
too
expensive
either
or
ivory
paint
could
be
used
there
could
be
a
frieze
on
of
white
lilac
and
the
graceful
white
broom
and
their
own
foliage
and
a
pale
cretonne
should
be
chosen
with
bunches
of
white
lilac
on
the
floor
should
be
covered
with
matting
and
rugs
which
would
bring
a
little
colour
into
the
room
and
the
furniture
should
be
enamel
upholstered
in
the
cretonne
in
the
pink
and
green
room
by
the
way
the
furniture
should
be
malachite
to
be
had
from
wallace
and
the
muslin
next
the
window
should
be
pink
and
green
lily
muslin
this
is
expensive
but
it
is
by
far
the
prettiest
muslin
for
such
a
room
that
could
be
found
i
think
low
are
still
the
best
chairs
for
a
but
if
they
can
be
afforded
one
or
two
higher
chairs
should
be
provided
i
find
corduroy
velveteen
the
best
thing
possible
to
cover
with
unless
one
has
a
maid
who
is
clever
enough
to
unpick
the
cretonne
covers
and
wash
and
replace
them
then
nothing
is
as
nice
as
cretonne
and
this
same
material
in
some
appropriate
shade
would
do
for
the
illustration
fig
simple
mantel
draping
larger
chairs
the
cost
of
these
must
depend
on
the
money
we
have
to
spend
but
a
good
chair
with
comfortable
springs
costs
from
to
and
if
the
money
can
be
managed
i
should
advise
as
much
as
this
being
given
it
will
be
cheaper
in
the
long
run
i
think
the
most
difficult
matter
of
all
to
explain
by
mere
words
is
the
arrangement
of
a
fireplace
which
is
already
supplied
with
one
of
the
marble
which
are
so
much
admired
by
builders
and
folks
who
can
not
help
being
impressed
with
the
idea
that
marble
and
a
claim
to
gentility
go
hand
in
hand
and
i
am
always
imploring
people
not
to
drape
these
imitations
with
elaborate
flutings
and
flounces
of
muslin
and
general
awfulnesses
if
the
or
indeed
any
other
room
is
burdened
with
one
of
these
paint
it
boldly
with
aspinall
the
paint
can
always
be
removed
either
with
or
else
by
the
paint
see
that
it
matches
the
rest
of
the
paint
in
the
room
then
place
along
it
the
simple
drapery
i
have
illustrated
here
this
is
quite
sufficient
it
hides
a
good
piece
of
the
underpart
of
the
structure
and
as
it
can
be
shaken
daily
does
not
collect
dust
and
dirt
as
must
all
more
elaborate
arrangements
inevitably
this
drapery
is
made
by
taking
a
straight
piece
of
material
about
inches
wider
and
inches
longer
than
the
itself
the
sides
and
front
are
edged
with
a
cord
and
a
tassel
or
else
a
few
pompons
are
hung
at
the
front
corners
the
drapery
is
placed
straight
along
the
the
uncorded
edge
against
the
wall
and
drapes
itself
being
kept
stationary
by
the
ornaments
and
photographs
we
usually
put
on
the
shelf
bokhara
plush
makes
the
best
drapery
but
if
this
is
used
three
or
four
should
be
made
at
the
same
time
or
else
the
plush
cuts
to
waste
of
course
the
rest
can
be
used
in
other
ways
it
makes
admirable
flat
for
bedrooms
with
a
brass
ring
at
the
end
and
could
be
used
as
toilet
covers
but
corduroy
velveteen
is
nearly
as
pretty
and
being
the
exact
width
required
would
be
the
best
material
to
use
it
is
only
a
yard
whatever
is
used
the
corners
of
the
drapery
should
be
lined
with
satin
or
sateen
either
in
a
paler
colour
than
the
drapery
itself
or
in
some
contrast
as
the
corners
show
and
would
not
look
nice
at
all
unless
they
were
lined
this
completes
the
drapery
which
is
the
only
one
that
should
be
allowed
as
it
is
simple
and
cleanly
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
any
other
arrangement
the
pattern
was
given
me
by
a
friend
who
bought
it
of
a
upholsterer
in
paris
and
is
so
simple
i
can
not
think
why
no
one
ever
thought
of
it
before
in
england
before
we
pass
away
from
speaking
of
the
fireplace
i
should
like
to
describe
one
or
two
ways
of
filling
up
the
recesses
generally
found
in
houses
in
a
i
should
always
place
the
buffets
there
which
i
recommend
in
place
of
sideboards
then
in
the
or
cosy
corner
illustrated
in
every
advertising
paper
is
to
be
recommended
for
one
side
this
seat
goes
straight
along
the
recess
and
has
an
end
that
returns
along
the
end
of
the
recess
giving
a
corner
in
which
to
sit
as
a
rule
these
seats
will
take
two
people
comfortably
above
the
padded
back
is
the
same
straight
piece
illustrated
in
the
corner
surmounted
by
the
but
if
people
do
not
wish
to
go
to
the
expense
of
an
elaborately
upholstered
and
spring
seat
they
can
easily
make
a
seat
for
themselves
by
having
a
wooden
frame
on
four
legs
made
to
fit
the
recess
the
top
should
be
covered
with
sacking
or
webbing
along
the
front
of
the
seat
should
be
nailed
a
full
flounce
of
corduroy
velveteen
lined
with
holland
a
square
cushion
made
from
wool
and
hair
mixed
should
be
placed
along
the
top
of
the
sacking
and
the
back
should
be
formed
by
hanging
two
square
cushions
on
the
wall
so
arranged
that
one
dovetails
with
the
other
in
the
corner
these
should
be
high
enough
to
allow
of
using
a
finish
of
for
china
which
should
be
put
along
the
top
of
the
cushions
and
keep
them
in
their
places
and
a
lamp
can
be
hung
over
the
seat
either
from
a
hook
placed
in
the
ceiling
itself
or
hanging
out
from
the
from
one
of
the
brass
arms
sold
by
benson
on
purpose
for
holding
lamps
for
about
each

would
give
light
to
anyone
who
sat
to

in
a
room
in
which
gas
was
banished
as
i
trust
it
may
soon
be
banished
from

either
in
favour
of

in

of
lamps

may
give
trouble
but
save
that
trouble
over
and
over
again

which
things
remain

would
have
become

spoiled
and
soiled

they
were

filled
by
using
talbot
design
published
in
the
and
which
i
have
her
permission
for
giving
here
and
which
is
not
only
very
pretty
but
decidedly
useful
it
could
be
made
by
any
carpenter
first
as
three
simple
shelves
the
top
and
bottom
shelves
should
be
of
equal
depth
the
centre
one
should
be
rather
narrower
and
the
whole
arrangement
should
not
be
above
the
line
of
the
mantelshelf
along
the
edge
of
the
shelves
should
be
glued
strips
of
japanese
leather
paper
and
the
top
shelf
should
be
divided
as
in
the
sketch
the
arches
being
either
simple
wooden
arches
cut
out
of
thin
wood
or
else
of
the
moorish
fretwork
sold
by
hindley
barker
the
bottom
shelf
should
have
three
separate
small
curtains
along
it
the
division
between
being
strips
of
wood
decorated
with
japanese
leather
of
course
this
arrangement
should
be
enamelled
to
match
the
rest
of
the
paint
and
the
silk
which
is
used
for
the
curtains
should
be
a
contrast
and
great
care
must
be
taken
to
employ
someone
who
does
not
make
his
woodwork
with
a
heavy
hand
as
some
cooks
make
pastry
for
i
once
saw
one
of
these
recess
arrangements
carried
out
in
such
a
way
that
the
whole
effect
was
dreadful
being
entirely
marred
by
the
thick
wood
and
heavy
arches
of
which
it
was
composed
any
china
can
be
arranged
therein
for
the
top
makes
an
admirable
for
odds
and
ends
and
favourite
photographs
or
books
an
armchair
should
be
put
by
the
side
and
this
will
suggest
at
once
a
comfortable
for
a
afternoon
without
any
more
elaborate
arrangement
illustration
fig
a
recess
i
am
so
often
asked
to
advise
people
on
paper
how
to
arrange
their
furniture
and
despite
my
strenuous
refusals
to
contemplate
such
a
waste
of
time
am
so
constantly
importuned
to
do
so
that
i
venture
to
pause
here
and
give
one
or
two
hints
on
the
subject
of
the
general
arrangement
of
as
although
it
is
naturally
quite
impossible
to
tell
positively
where
to
place
a
chair
i
have
never
seen
in
a
house
i
have
never
entered
it
is
possible
i
trust
to
give
general
hints
which
shall
enable
my
readers
to
make
their
rather
more
comfortable
than
most
of
them
seem
able
to
do
at
present
for
example
no
matter
how
small
a
room
is
an
enormous
amount
of
comfort
and
a
certain
idea
of
unlimited
space
is
always
given
by
placing
a
screen
judiciously
by
the
door
this
prevents
the
whole
of
the
room
being
on
view
at
once
and
gives
an
opportunity
of
placing
a
chair
or
two
behind
it
which
we
could
not
do
were
the
door
to
open
into
the
passage
and
leave
a
yawning
gulf
behind
back
or
were
it
to
open
into
the
room
and
so
leave
an
exposed
place
at
once
where
no
one
could
sit
because
they
would
feel
they
were
sitting
in
the
passage
and
again
no
chairs
should
be
isolated
or
put
out
of
reach
if
they
are
they
will
surely
be
sought
out
at
once
by
some
shy
caller
or
visitor
and
we
shall
have
to
spend
our
time
endeavouring
to
draw
him
or
her
into
the
circle
by
this
i
do
not
mean
that
our
chairs
should
be
arranged
as
if
we
were
expecting
the
assembling
together
of
a
but
that
they
should
be
within
reach
both
of
ourselves
the
fire
in
winter
the
window
in
summer
and
of
the
light
always
then
shall
we
be
quite
sure
our
guests
are
happy
or
if
they
are
not
that
it
is
their
own
fault
and
not
ours
there
should
be
a
place
for
each
member
of
the
household
in
any
room
and
attention
to
these
details
even
causes
the
furniture
to
in
some
measure
arrange
itself
and
be
so
placed
that
it
shows
to
the
greatest
advantage
and
can
at
the
same
time
be
used
by
the
owners
in
the
best
manner
possible
as
well
if
more
lamps
are
required
in
a
room
than
the
two
or
three
which
are
usually
quite
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
general
lighting
those
who
require
special
lamps
should
be
encouraged
to
look
after
them
themselves
especially
in
the
case
of
the
daughters
of
the
house
on
whom
in
most
families
should
devolve
all
the
and
finer
parts
of
housekeeping
of
which
by
that
time
the
will
no
doubt
be
weary
and
will
only
be
too
glad
to
hand
over
to
those
who
are
full
of
energy
as
well
as
of
the
very
newest
ideas
on
the
subject
of
how
to
arrange
the
flowers
on
which
so
much
of
the
appearance
of
the
house
depends
i
like
the
sofa
placed
out
straight
from
the
side
of
the
fire
as
in
fig
or
straight
along
in
front
of
it
about
seven
or
eight
feet
from
the
front
of
the
fire
and
in
some
rooms
the
piano
that
most
undecorative
piece
of
furniture
can
be
put
with
one
end
straight
against
the
wall
in
the
recess
the
other
straight
out
into
the
room
with
the
sofa
against
the
back
or
else
a
comfortable
chair
as
represented
in
fig
which
will
i
hope
give
my
readers
a
good
idea
how
to
manage
a
piano
which
can
be
placed
either
out
from
the
wall
in
the
recess
across
one
corner
of
a
room
or
out
in
the
room
itself
and
indeed
in
any
way
that
will
not
necessitate
its
back
against
the
wall
a
position
that
is
fatal
to
anything
like
music
for
it
is
terrible
to
play
with
back
to
audience
or
to
sing
straight
into
the
wall
which
throws
voice
straight
back
at
one
all
the
time
one
is
singing
as
will
be
seen
from
the
sketch
the
baize
at
the
back
of
the
piano
is
first
covered
with
a
good
japanese
leather
paper
and
then
soft
silk
is
carelessly
draped
over
it
finishing
with
a
long
piece
at
one
side
the
top
of
the
piano
is
first
covered
with
the
soft
silk
which
is
fastened
by
tiny
tacks
inside
the
lid
to
keep
it
in
its
place
and
then
by
a
piece
of
japanese
embroidery
at
one
end
is
a
tall
from
liberty
with
a
big
brass
pot
holding
a
palm
at
the
back
where
there
is
no
distinct
drapery
stands
a
small
screen
and
at
the
other
end
is
a
cairene
inlaid
stool
holding
a
jar
of
grasses
but
i
should
prefer
myself
a
much
taller
arrangement
as
the
end
of
the
piano
is
not
at
all
a
pretty
object
the
silk
which
is
found
in
the
front
of
most
pianos
should
be
replaced
by
japanese
leather
paper
if
draping
is
objected
to
and
it
should
never
be
attempted
by
anyone
who
can
not
pay
some
artist
in
drapery
to
manage
it
for
them
unless
of
course
their
own
fingers
are
clever
at
it
a
very
good
substitute
is
formed
by
using
one
of
from
which
can
be
hung
a
simple
full
curtain
of
some
good
and
beautiful
brocade
such
as
is
their
nismes
brocade
the
top
should
always
be
arranged
as
shown
in
the
sketch
for
though
these
things
may
deaden
the
sound
illustration
fig
a
draped
piano
and
a
good
musician
would
no
doubt
rage
about
them
they
can
be
removed
in
three
seconds
to
a
side
table
should
music
be
the
order
of
the
day
and
could
be
replaced
at
once
without
giving
anyone
any
undue
amount
of
trouble
i
have
seen
a
in
a
very
small
room
placed
against
the
piano
the
back
of
which
having
been
first
covered
with
brocade
served
as
a
species
of
for
all
that
is
usually
found
on
a
but
i
can
not
seriously
recommend
this
as
it
is
certainly
incongruous
to
find
cards
of
invitation
balls
of
string
and
and
general
fastened
about
a
piano
which
must
i
am
sure
resent
tremendously
this
extraordinary
manner
of
embellishing
it
i
have
never
seen
a
piano
arranged
in
a
better
manner
than
the
one
illustrated
here
by
the
kind
permission
of
my
successor
at
my
dear
shortlands
house
in
whose
hands
the
traditions
of
the
house
are
well
kept
up
and
who
has
filled
my
shoes
there
much
better
than
i
filled
them
myself
one
of
her
improvements
being
the
drapery
over
the
conservatory
door
which
i
have
illustrated
here
so
many
people
having
doors
like
that
one
and
being
quite
unable
to
manage
them
properly
the
door
is
composed
as
are
all
similar
doors
of
glass
at
the
top
and
two
small
panels
in
the
wooden
frame
below
these
are
filled
in
with
japanese
leather
paper
a
brass
handle
and
one
are
added
only
one
should
ever
be
put
on
a
door
and
that
should
be
put
above
the
and
on
the
top
of
the
glass
is
placed
one
of
the
pretty
bead
blinds
this
is
a
graduated
one
and
is
just
indicated
in
the
sketch
on
the
side
nearest
the
fire
hangs
a
straight
full
piece
of
drapery
edged
all
round
with
ball
fringe
while
on
the
other
side
is
draped
a
curtain
with
a
drawing
string
which
lets
down
in
a
moment
to
hide
the
door
entirely
at
night
a
further
idea
of
how
this
room
is
now
arranged
is
given
by
the
tall
and
the
end
of
a
deep
low
beautiful
sofa
from
liberty
which
i
never
see
without
breaking
the
tenth
commandment
the
sides
and
back
are
quite
straight
the
seat
is
very
broad
and
is
heaped
with
the
frilled
pillows
which
are
as
popular
as
they
are
useful
and
pretty
the
sofa
is
enamelled
white
and
is
covered
with
a
beautiful
yellow
brocade
the
curtains
beyond
by
the
window
being
of
a
morris
cretonne
which
resembles
both
in
colour
and
design
the
brown
and
yellow
velveteen
from
graham
biddle
mentioned
before
this
design
makes
admirable
portiÃ¨res
illustration
fig
conservatory
door
and
is
always
a
pleasure
to
look
at
the
tambourine
is
hung
on
the
dado
which
is
of
a
very
good
yellow
and
white
matting
and
is
headed
with
bamboo
and
despite
the
favour
into
which
friezes
have
grown
of
late
years
a
favour
they
quite
deserve
i
must
say
i
still
cling
to
the
dado
in
the
in
the
former
they
give
solidity
to
the
wall
which
they
always
keep
tidy
in
the
latter
they
serve
admirably
as
places
on
which
to
hang
our
favourite
nicknacks
and
those
small
sketches
and
pictures
which
we
prize
and
which
would
almost
be
lost
to
sight
were
we
to
hang
them
above
the
height
of
the
where
we
could
not
have
them
near
us
so
i
strongly
advise
a
dado
whenever
we
can
have
one
in
the
and
i
have
been
lately
confirmed
in
my
opinion
by
seeing
two
newly
decorated
rooms
where
the
dado
was
useless
as
far
as
regarded
the
hanging
of
pet
possessions
but
it
was
so
decorative
that
i
am
forced
to
pause
here
for
a
moment
and
give
a
description
of
them
both
in
room
no
the
was
my
favourite
yellow
and
white
from
smee
all
the
paint
was
a
deep
ivory
and
the
was
ivory
too
for
about
a
yard
below
the
rail
the
wall
was
coloured
primrose
and
over
this
was
hung
a
full
soft
curtain
of
yellow
silk
closely
plaited
on
tiny
rings
which
again
were
hung
on
nails
below
the
rail
which
curved
out
over
them
and
hid
them
completely
this
curtain
could
be
taken
down
and
shaken
and
replaced
every
week
if
desired
while
of
course
during
absence
from
town
the
silk
would
be
folded
up
and
put
away
the
loose
curtain
looks
charming
round
the
room
which
is
a
very
tiny
one
and
has
been
admirably
arranged
by
smee
with
a
fitted
seat
at
one
side
of
the
wall
with
side
curtains
to
give
an
idea
of
privacy
and
above
that
is
a
long
bookcase
the
curtains
are
of
the
beautiful
larkspur
cretonne
which
has
yellow
and
blue
in
it
the
carpet
is
a
deep
red
to
give
more
colour
as
the
room
is
to
be
used
for
day
and
therefore
requires
to
be
made
to
look
warmer
than
could
be
done
were
only
blue
and
yellow
used
and
the
furniture
is
all
ivory
and
upholstered
in
different
brocades
albeit
these
are
also
covered
with
loose
cretonne
covers
in
the
larkspur
cretonne
which
is
a
yard
but
really
deserves
to
cost
as
much
it
is
so
pretty
although
i
do
own
it
is
rather
expensive
for
a
mere
cretonne
the
other
room
in
which
i
saw
the
curtain
dado
was
much
more
sombre
in
design
and
colouring
and
i
do
not
for
one
moment
recommend
such
a
distressingly
dark
arrangement
although
i
do
most
heartily
commend
the
clever
designer
of
this
original
room
the
dado
was
not
the
straight
curtain
which
goes
all
round
the
room
which
i
have
been
writing
about
but
it
started
from
the
window
at
one
end
five
feet
above
the
floor
this
continued
for
halfway
along
the
wall
where
it
suddenly
lowered
to
within
three
feet
of
the
floor
leaving
a
piece
of
wall
about
three
feet
across
and
two
deep
after
running
along
for
three
feet
at
this
lowered
angle
it
rose
again
and
continued
along
the
wall
to
the
door
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
the
curtain
began
at
three
feet
from
the
wainscoting
and
continued
for
about
five
feet
when
it
rose
once
more
and
continued
at
the
first
altitude
for
the
rest
of
the
wall
which
ended
in
a
corner
the
curtain
lowered
from
that
to
the
fireplace
which
with
its
overmantel
filled
one
square
the
dado
beginning
once
more
at
the
altitude
after
the
fireplace
was
passed
the
curtain
was
serge
and
was
hung
from
a
pole
painted
with
brass
rings
which
were
and
above
the
curtain
the
wall
was
covered
with
a
very
good
japanese
leather
paper
the
squares
made
by
the
dropping
of
the
curtain
being
filled
in
one
place
by
a
choice
picture
in
another
by
an
admirably
designed
bracket
for
books
and
china
and
in
another
by
a
square
beaten
brass
shield
holding
an
elaborate
and
beautiful
clustered
candelabra
and
had
the
drapery
been
of
some
bright
colour
or
some
really
decorative
brocade
the
house
would
have
been
as
charming
as
it
was
original
but
arranged
with
the
dark
japanese
paper
and
the
much
darker
drapery
the
whole
effect
was
so
depressing
that
i
felt
were
i
obliged
to
remain
in
that
house
i
should
have
committed
suicide
for
my
spirits
would
never
have
borne
up
under
it
but
it
was
a
dark
day
as
the
owner
pointed
out
when
i
told
him
at
his
request
what
i
thought
of
it
all
but
i
maintain
that
as
most
of
our
english
days
and
more
especially
our
london
days
are
extremely
dark
we
are
bound
to
try
and
make
our
rooms
so
beautiful
that
they
at
least
shall
not
in
any
way
add
to
the
depression
that
is
inseparable
from
walls
and
darkness
generally
we
can
not
have
too
much
cheerfulness
i
maintain
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
be
too
happy
and
too
lively
and
as
our
climate
does
not
help
us
to
be
either
the
one
or
the
other
we
must
endeavour
to
simulate
as
much
sunshine
as
we
can
by
making
our
rooms
cheerful
and
as
as
we
have
the
power
to
do
i
never
go
into
my
own
rooms
or
the
many
rooms
i
have
helped
to
decorate
without
feeling
that
whatever
else
may
be
their
faults
they
certainly
can
not
be
called
gloomy
they
are
all
bright
and
cheerful
and
i
defy
anyone
to
be
miserable
long
unless
of
course
some
real
misfortune
has
occurred
in
one
of
my
rooms
in
the
green
serge
abode
a
misfitting
dress
would
be
as
dreadful
a
sorrow
as
a
broken
arm
a
disappointment
about
an
entertainment
as
serious
as
an
illness
or
loss
of
money
flowers
again
should
never
be
forgotten
or
allowed
to
become
dead
and
shabby
and
above
all
each
room
we
occupy
should
be
scrupulously
clean
and
without
being
aggressively
neat
should
be
absolutely
tidy
directly
a
thing
becomes
dirty
or
untidy
it
should
be
cleaned
or
replaced
by
something
else
we
should
never
overlook
the
soiling
of
the
paint
a
crushed
antimacassar
a
dirty
ceiling
and
above
all
we
should
remember
that
no
amount
of
artistic
knowledge
and
careful
decoration
can
make
up
for
grimy
tablecloths
and
crooked
vases
papers
and
crushed
chairbacks
and
damaged
cretonnes
a
room
must
not
only
be
made
nice
it
must
be
kept
so
and
if
we
can
not
afford
good
servants
who
will
respect
our
belongings
we
must
do
the
finer
parts
of
the
housework
ourselves
it
is
no
disgrace
to
wash
fine
china
and
turn
and
fold
our
tablecloths
and
draperies
it
is
disgraceful
to
have
dirty
ornaments
and
to
be
untidy
and
careless
about
our
rooms
indeed
if
any
of
us
really
want
our
rooms
to
look
nice
we
should
no
matter
how
good
are
our
servants
go
carefully
over
them
ourselves
the
moment
the
work
is
done
and
see
that
all
is
as
we
like
it
servants
do
not
place
furniture
they
it
into
its
place
the
tablecloths
are
usually
put
on
wrong
side
out
and
somehow
or
other
all
seems
to
require
the
touch
which
can
not
be
explained
but
is
certainly
observable
in
any
house
where
the
mistress
is
untidy
and
so
naturally
excuses
untidiness
in
those
around
her
i
maintain
that
tidiness
is
quite
a
gift
and
that
she
who
is
possessed
of
that
admirable
quality
makes
things
go
twice
as
far
as
does
she
who
never
attempts
to
put
a
thing
straight
who
overlooks
dust
and
dirt
and
without
knowing
precisely
how
it
is
managed
gets
her
house
into
endless
muddle
and
never
allows
it
to
look
nice
albeit
she
spends
three
times
as
much
over
it
as
does
she
who
is
gifted
with
tidiness
and
a
therefore
if
a
house
is
to
be
properly
kept
the
moment
a
handle
comes
off
a
door
replace
it
the
instant
a
thing
looks
in
the
least
degree
dirty
have
it
washed
or
cleaned
let
any
carpet
be
mended
before
it
goes
into
a
hole
have
black
cleaned
off
any
ceiling
the
moment
it
comes
on
it
and
above
all
have
the
china
clean
and
straight
and
never
overlook
a
rent
or
a
dirty
mark
if
a
house
is
kept
nice
the
expenses
are
gradual
if
all
is
neglected
the
day
of
reckoning
which
must
come
inevitably
will
be
such
a
heavy
one
that
it
will
cost
more
than
can
be
afforded
by
anyone
who
is
not
a
millionaire
and
it
must
come
for
even
if
the
house
is
our
own
we
must
leave
it
some
time
and
our
successor
will
not
revere
our
memory
or
remember
us
even
with
kindness
when
he
comes
after
us
and
repairs
our
ravages
which
need
have
been
unimportant
had
we
punctually
spent
the
yearly
sum
for
repairs
which
should
always
be
set
aside
by
every
careful
householder
every
room
in
every
house
should
be
and
papered
at
least
every
seventh
year
outside
painting
should
be
done
every
third
year
the
ceilings
should
be
cleansed
the
moment
they
begin
to
look
dirty
and
we
should
never
possess
curtains
or
carpets
which
we
can
not
afford
to
replace
somehow
or
that
will
not
readily
wash
and
darn
and
shake
when
they
begin
to
show
signs
of
having
been
used
a
pretty
house
in
good
order
will
always
let
should
we
desire
to
move
while
a
house
in
bad
repair
and
dirty
will
never
find
a
tenant
even
if
the
landlord
is
a
model
one
and
is
willing
to
do
all
he
can
in
the
matter
of
new
decorations
for
somehow
the
squalor
and
grime
that
greet
the
eye
first
on
entering
never
seem
forgotten
and
the
house
is
passed
over
again
and
again
because
it
is
impossible
to
believe
a
house
in
such
a
state
can
ever
be
made
either
healthy
or
beautiful
before
passing
away
from
the
three
ordinary
in
a
house
i
should
like
just
to
speak
of
some
of
the
new
styles
of
decoration
which
have
come
to
the
fore
lately
and
which
i
am
glad
to
say
are
all
as
cheerful
as
can
be
not
that
the
arrangements
i
have
advocated
have
been
relegated
to
that
mysterious
limbo
dedicated
to
the
fashions
of
last
week
i
have
at
last
i
am
delighted
to
be
able
to
tell
my
readers
persuaded
one
or
two
of
the
more
enterprising
tradesmen
to
recognise
the
fact
that
a
thing
which
was
good
and
satisfactory
last
week
is
just
as
good
and
satisfactory
this
and
all
the
schemes
of
decoration
i
gave
before
are
still
to
be
had
but
tastes
change
and
it
is
always
well
to
be
prepared
with
some
new
ideas
for
rooms
are
all
different
and
what
suits
one
room
will
not
suit
another
i
still
like
the
japanese
plain
paper
red
and
gold
leather
dado
and
red
paint
better
than
anything
else
for
a
just
as
i
cling
to
my
blue
but
as
it
would
not
do
for
us
all
to
have
this
same
decoration
i
often
advise
an
admirable
tapestry
paper
sold
by
pither
at
a
piece
this
can
either
have
or
paint
and
a
dado
of
japanese
leather
paper
carefully
chosen
to
harmonise
with
the
paper
and
which
should
have
dull
red
and
green
and
gold
in
its
design
in
very
dark
and
unobtrusive
shades
the
ceiling
paper
should
be
pale
yellow
and
white
the
cornice
cream
the
doors
should
be
panelled
with
the
japanese
paper
and
the
curtains
should
either
be
of
gobelin
tapestry
at
a
yard
wide
width
or
else
of
velveteen
or
serge
the
colour
of
the
paint
whichever
is
chosen
and
the
carpet
should
be
an
oriental
one
if
possible
with
a
dark
red
matting
surround
or
else
of
dark
red
either
in
pile
brussels
or
kidderminster
according
to
the
price
one
wishes
to
give
this
style
of
decoration
would
suit
almost
any
furniture
though
i
should
prefer
the
chairs
to
be
covered
with
the
gobelin
tapestry
which
wears
admirably
and
which
should
always
be
used
to
old
or
shabby
chairs
instead
of
a
cheap
leather
this
covering
could
be
done
at
home
by
an
upholsteress
if
necessary
but
i
should
advise
the
chairs
being
taken
in
hand
by
someone
who
can
the
stuffing
if
the
expense
can
be
afforded
if
it
can
not
the
leather
should
be
left
as
it
is
all
unevennesses
and
excrescences
should
be
made
even
by
judicious
use
of
on
the
leather
then
a
tight
cover
of
holland
should
be
first
put
on
finally
the
cover
of
gobelin
tapestry
which
should
not
be
buttoned
down
but
should
be
stretched
over
and
secured
in
its
place
with
a
gimp
each
chair
would
cost
about
or
certainly
not
more
where
the
mania
exists
an
artistic
can
be
made
by
using
all
paint
essex
design
stamped
on
real
brown
paper
a
gold
and
brown
leather
dado
all
yellow
serge
or
velveteen
curtains
and
a
square
carpet
and
great
care
should
be
taken
in
both
rooms
to
have
the
proper
tablecloths
which
burnett
makes
from
a
design
i
gave
him
and
which
have
been
largely
used
and
recommended
by
the
several
imitators
of
mine
which
have
sprung
up
in
divers
papers
since
i
first
began
my
own
notion
of
giving
advice
on
the
matter
of
house
decoration
and
arrangement
through
the
columns
of
a
newspaper
now
some
six
long
years
ago
and
which
are
far
better
and
more
artistic
than
any
others
i
have
ever
seen
the
cloth
is
plain
serge
or
felt
with
a
contrasting
border
united
to
the
cloth
itself
by
a
gimp
in
which
both
colours
are
mingled
and
finished
off
with
a
ball
fringe
these
cloths
cost
about
for
an
ordinary
table
and
as
they
will
clean
and
dye
would
last
some
years
if
properly
looked
after
i
have
already
spoken
about
the
decoration
and
therefore
i
will
only
add
a
few
words
on
the
subject
of
the
where
the
scheme
i
so
often
recommend
can
not
be
improved
upon
by
those
who
can
afford
a
reasonably
expensive
scheme
of
decoration
of
course
the
very
greatest
care
must
be
taken
to
avoid
anything
like
the
paper
of
our
ancestors
but
this
usually
was
accompanied
by
grained
maple
paint
which
gave
the
last
touch
of
horror
to
the
scene
and
therefore
could
never
resemble
the
delicate
ivory
paint
which
aspinall
has
made
so
easy
for
us
and
i
still
admire
beautiful
paper
at
a
piece
better
than
anything
else
and
with
this
i
advise
a
dado
of
collinson
cretonne
this
should
be
secured
with
a
as
then
the
cretonne
could
be
removed
to
be
washed
all
the
chairs
should
be
put
into
frilled
cretonne
covers
of
the
same
cretonne
made
like
those
in
fig
the
curtains
should
be
of
printed
linen
at
a
yard
edged
with
ball
illustration
fig
frilled
chairs
and
sofa
fringe
at
a
yard
and
the
carpet
should
be
dark
blue
pile
with
a
pattern
that
resembles
tiny
daisies
powdered
all
over
the
surface
in
a
paler
shade
of
blue
great
exception
has
been
taken
to
printed
linen
because
it
fades
so
it
does
but
then
it
is
very
cheap
it
lasts
two
years
in
a
sunny
window
four
in
one
that
is
not
sunny
and
finally
dyes
beautifully
fringe
and
all
coming
back
from
the
immortal
pullar
as
good
as
on
the
day
it
was
first
bought
i
think
one
can
complain
very
much
about
a
material
which
behaves
like
that
can
one
but
of
course
the
printed
linen
as
curtains
can
be
replaced
by
silk
damask
or
by
cretonne
itself
should
the
material
be
objected
to
no
colour
lights
up
so
well
as
yellow
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
and
another
decoration
could
be
made
from
the
yellow
paper
sold
by
essex
all
cream
paint
and
a
frieze
of
chrysanthemums
either
painted
by
hand
or
else
of
the
excellent
printed
design
sold
by
haines
at
the
yard
with
this
the
carpet
should
be
red
and
the
curtains
should
either
be
of
a
brocade
which
introduces
the
shades
in
the
flowers
or
else
of
a
cretonne
all
would
depend
on
how
much
money
there
was
to
spend
but
whether
cretonne
or
brocade
is
used
it
must
match
the
frieze
in
some
measure
though
great
cornices
and
vast
over
are
entirely
out
of
date
and
will
never
i
trust
return
into
fashion
there
are
still
some
unfortunates
who
labour
under
these
possessions
and
who
dare
not
rid
themselves
of
them
much
as
they
would
like
to
do
so
and
who
may
be
glad
to
learn
how
these
horrors
may
in
some
measure
be
mitigated
all
cornices
become
less
repulsive
directly
they
are
aspinalled
ivory
i
can
not
tell
why
but
this
seems
to
metamorphose
them
at
once
and
makes
them
quite
ornamental
while
the
frame
of
the
glass
can
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
unless
the
frames
are
quite
flat
in
which
case
they
should
be
covered
with
brocade
in
the
same
manner
in
which
the
fashionable
frames
for
photographs
are
now
managed
in
any
case
all
the
heavy
flourishes
and
should
be
removed
and
the
glass
made
in
every
way
as
plain
and
unobtrusive
as
possible
draping
with
muslin
or
even
with
liberty
silk
is
never
successful
and
only
makes
the
object
draped
like
one
of
the
possessions
carefully
guarded
in
a
similar
manner
by
the
careful
landlady
from
the
encroachments
of
the
flies
and
is
therefore
much
to
be
avoided
never
no
matter
what
the
time
of
year
put
it
out
of
your
power
to
have
a
fire
should
you
so
desire
it
i
still
cling
to
the
japanese
umbrella
and
have
never
found
a
substitute
for
it
which
is
so
absolutely
satisfactory
if
its
stick
is
properly
cut
it
hides
the
wood
and
coal
and
grate
entirely
and
gives
a
bright
spot
of
colour
and
can
be
removed
at
once
a
curtain
hung
straight
down
from
a
slight
rod
just
under
the
top
of
the
grate
itself
looks
very
neat
as
does
a
series
of
rings
to
hold
just
brought
out
by
hamilton
of
the
quentin
matsys
forge
york
street
westminster
this
holds
twelve
pots
of
flowers
and
can
be
lifted
out
in
a
moment
altogether
should
a
fire
be
required
and
would
always
look
well
put
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
one
of
the
guild
brocade
screens
with
miniatures
answers
well
too
and
giles
has
invented
from
my
description
a
fireplace
cabinet
which
put
under
the
wooden
which
is
in
an
artistic
house
continues
the
mantel
and
overmantel
decorations
and
makes
the
whole
appear
like
a
good
cabinet
for
books
china
and
flowers
this
can
also
be
removed
in
a
few
minutes
and
either
hung
on
the
wall
or
placed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
the
perfect
has
yet
to
be
invented
but
until
some
clever
genius
has
done
this
either
of
the
above
ideas
answers
quite
well
but
i
do
solemnly
warn
my
readers
against
fashionable
with
paper
ivy
and
grapes
wandering
over
it
fans
outstretched
in
plush
with
senseless
photographs
let
in
as
if
photographs
could
be
in
place
on
the
hearth
and
all
the
thousand
and
one
freaks
of
fashion
that
are
brought
out
by
those
who
ought
to
know
better
and
who
have
filled
many
houses
to
overflowing
with
terrible
plush
frames
soiled
satin
bags
useless
odds
and
ends
and
ghastly
painted
tables
brackets
and
stands
which
are
costly
to
begin
with
and
so
we
do
not
like
to
dispose
of
them
too
hastily
and
which
should
never
be
seen
in
the
houses
of
those
who
really
want
to
have
an
artistic
and
pretty
home
with
which
solemn
warning
we
will
pass
on
to
sterner
subjects
and
will
consider
in
another
chapter
how
to
treat
the
more
portion
of
the
house
where
work
or
pleasure
may
be
gone
in
for
chapter
iv
the
and
library
must
be
nothing
frivolous
light
or
airy
in
the
aspect
of
either
of
these
rooms
all
must
be
sombre
and
steady
if
not
dark
and
though
i
do
not
go
so
far
as
this
the
ordinary
dictum
of
the
upholsterer
i
am
quite
willing
to
allow
that
in
the
at
least
lightness
and
frivolity
are
out
of
place
albeit
i
can
not
allow
that
even
this
room
need
be
sombre
and
dreary
while
certainly
it
ought
to
light
up
well
as
it
is
a
room
which
is
generally
used
merely
at
night
wherever
it
can
be
afforded
and
wherever
there
are
young
men
or
lads
in
the
house
there
should
always
be
a
and
the
girls
should
be
encouraged
to
play
with
their
brothers
and
their
friends
as
long
as
their
mother
or
father
can
remain
in
the
room
as
some
sort
of
guard
and
guide
the
pleasanter
home
is
made
the
less
inclination
will
young
men
have
to
go
elsewhere
for
their
amusements
and
if
they
are
accustomed
to
be
made
happy
and
feel
that
their
friends
are
welcome
too
they
will
not
keep
outside
home
for
the
pleasure
that
is
to
be
found
without
crossing
the
threshold
a
in
winter
a
couple
of
good
in
summer
and
the
hours
of
leisure
will
pass
comfortably
along
and
leave
neither
time
nor
opportunities
for
less
desirable
pleasures
example
is
everything
in
a
house
a
thousand
sermons
will
not
speak
as
loudly
against
betting
and
gambling
and
drink
the
horrors
of
my
existence
as
will
the
example
of
a
house
where
such
things
are
never
allowed
and
yet
where
amusements
of
all
kinds
are
not
frowned
upon
and
refused
where
games
are
encouraged
for
their
own
sakes
and
where
a
healthy
outdoor
life
replaces
the
loafing
hours
which
are
all
too
often
the
portion
of
those
who
have
been
accustomed
to
and
loafing
because
they
have
seen
these
two
habits
allowed
as
a
matter
of
course
from
their
earliest
days
and
before
i
speak
of
the
mere
walls
and
furniture
of
a
let
me
impress
upon
my
readers
not
to
allow
this
room
to
be
turned
into
a
base
imitation
of
a
i
am
not
a
teetotaler
and
have
small
patience
with
those
intolerant
individuals
whose
language
and
statements
are
all
too
often
as
bad
and
violent
as
they
are
absolutely
unreliable
and
untrue
and
i
do
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
living
our
present
eager
and
artificial
existence
without
the
aid
of
alcohol
in
some
shape
or
the
other
certainly
not
after
we
have
borne
the
heat
and
stress
of
the
day
and
we
require
something
stronger
than
water
to
sustain
us
but
i
do
absolutely
condemn
the
insane
and
insensate
habit
in
which
so
many
indulge
nowadays
of
continually
drinking
between
meals
were
stimulants
taken
at
meals
only
were
spirits
with
the
exception
of
brandy
which
should
be
kept
entirely
as
a
most
valuable
medicine
abolished
we
should
have
no
drunkards
and
the
teetotalers
would
lose
all
excuse
for
their
most
unpleasant
and
untruthful
existences
and
as
we
now
seldom
see
a
drunkard
in
our
streets
and
never
contemplate
the
pleasing
scenes
which
after
dinner
in
our
times
were
visible
in
many
from
which
no
gentleman
ever
issued
to
join
the
ladies
because
he
was
generally
under
the
table
or
else
fast
asleep
with
both
arms
on
it
i
am
in
great
hopes
that
we
are
learning
to
be
a
sober
nation
though
i
hope
sincerely
never
to
see
it
an
absolutely
teetotal
one
for
beer
and
wine
are
necessary
i
am
convinced
in
our
climate
and
we
should
be
miserable
indeed
were
we
debarred
as
the
fanatics
would
debar
us
from
the
use
of
all
fermented
or
alcoholic
drinks
but
we
must
be
moderate
and
we
must
not
drink
between
meals
and
we
must
avoid
the
constant
which
appear
inseparable
from
some
and
to
which
is
due
no
doubt
the
pious
horror
many
good
folks
have
of
this
chamber
in
a
house
and
i
should
like
it
to
be
firmly
understood
that
the
room
was
for
the
game
merely
and
that
anything
like
would
be
at
once
and
sternly
discouraged
this
being
satisfactorily
settled
we
may
proceed
to
plan
and
decorate
our
with
a
clear
conscience
secure
in
the
fact
that
we
are
simply
providing
a
place
for
innocent
amusement
that
will
be
of
invaluable
service
at
night
and
on
wet
saturday
afternoons
and
that
will
not
prove
a
snare
and
to
any
more
especially
if
we
as
sternly
refuse
to
allow
gambling
as
we
refuse
to
allow
imbibing
at
odd
moments
of
the
day
or
night
i
am
always
astonished
that
no
crusade
has
been
raised
against
the
national
sin
of
gambling
drink
ruins
the
homes
of
poor
men
but
not
more
certainly
or
rapidly
than
gambling
ruins
the
homes
of
rich
men
and
of
men
far
from
rich
drink
may
kill
a
man
but
it
takes
a
great
many
drunkards
to
imbibe
an
estate
while
one
gambling
may
scatter
the
savings
of
a
lifetime
and
turn
all
the
wretched
children
of
a
selfish
gambler
into
the
streets
to
starve
i
have
been
horrified
sometimes
to
see
ladies
and
gentlemen
hot
eager
excited
gambling
in
private
houses
the
host
actually
bent
on
winning
from
those
who
are
enjoying
his
hospitality
the
hostess
almost
insulting
her
guests
in
her
awful
anxiety
to
gain
the
contents
of
their
purses
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
only
way
to
escape
this
demon
is
to
refuse
to
pander
to
it
at
all
to
never
allow
one
single
penny
to
be
staked
at
cards
in
own
house
and
to
make
this
such
a
rule
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
break
it
on
any
consideration
whatever
i
have
seen
pennies
played
for
which
begat
the
taste
for
gambling
for
much
larger
sums
and
i
have
never
seen
a
house
where
gambling
was
allowed
truly
prosper
or
be
anything
save
the
residence
of
those
whose
ideas
and
hopes
were
centred
in
this
world
only
and
never
rose
above
the
mere
existence
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
despicable
and
awful
this
book
is
not
a
tract
and
therefore
i
do
not
say
one
half
i
should
like
to
on
this
subject
but
as
i
remember
the
ruined
homes
one
family
especially
where
all
are
scattered
and
most
are
dead
where
gambling
went
on
in
the
schoolroom
and
alike
at
every
moment
which
could
be
snatched
for
the
purpose
the
broken
hearts
the
miserably
wrecked
careers
entirely
due
to
this
vice
when
one
can
hardly
take
up
a
paper
without
seeing
the
dreary
fate
of
some
wretched
youth
whose
tendencies
to
betting
and
gaming
have
caused
him
to
rob
his
till
and
landed
him
in
penal
servitude
i
must
say
i
can
not
help
feeling
astonished
that
the
eager
teetotalers
do
not
try
their
hands
at
putting
down
gaming
especially
as
they
have
the
law
on
their
side
the
kind
good
law
which
snaps
up
little
boys
who
play
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
that
winks
at
and
the
big
races
and
finally
is
utterly
powerless
to
punish
the
gamester
who
spends
his
nights
at
and
ruins
his
home
and
his
wretched
constitution
at
the
same
time
however
lest
i
weary
my
readers
in
dwelling
on
this
subject
about
which
one
can
not
say
too
much
i
think
i
will
now
simply
speak
of
the
decoration
of
the
having
i
hope
so
judiciously
sandwiched
the
powder
between
the
jam
in
this
chapter
that
those
who
seek
for
information
about
the
room
itself
may
unawares
come
upon
it
and
so
be
forced
to
meditate
whether
they
like
it
or
not
on
some
of
the
reasons
why
so
many
people
dread
the
idea
of
a
where
there
are
boys
if
gambling
were
the
veriest
chadband
might
learn
to
handle
the
cue
while
a
pastor
at
a
dissenting
chapel
need
not
dread
the
eyes
of
his
deacons
were
he
found
disporting
himself
in
the
halls
of
the
ungodly
which
would
cease
to
be
ungodly
or
be
no
more
so
than
the
harmless
were
betting
eliminated
from
among
their
charms
and
nothing
but
the
game
itself
really
and
truly
encouraged
and
allowed
a
big
room
is
a
necessity
for
a
which
should
never
by
any
chance
be
shorter
than
feet
long
by
twenty
broad
a
table
measures
twelve
feet
by
six
and
the
size
i
have
spoken
of
only
allows
sufficient
comfortable
room
for
walking
round
the
table
and
for
the
usual
raised
seats
which
are
always
put
at
the
ends
and
on
one
side
of
the
room
personally
i
should
prefer
a
much
larger
room
still
as
i
like
to
see
one
end
of
the
room
furnished
as
a
species
of
but
of
course
in
london
the
by
twenty
room
would
be
ample
in
the
country
the
comes
in
for
days
when
shooting
is
impossible
and
the
end
there
is
a
great
advantage
in
more
ways
than
one
quite
a
charming
can
be
made
by
using
all
brown
paint
and
a
high
dado
to
the
top
of
the
door
of
brown
and
gold
japanese
leather
paper
above
the
dado
the
wall
should
be
painted
the
cornice
should
be
replaced
by
a
coving
which
should
terminate
in
a
from
whence
the
ordinary
could
be
hung
for
use
at
night
and
these
surely
could
be
in
beaten
iron
with
some
prettier
shades
than
the
hideous
green
things
which
match
the
equally
hideous
cloth
which
i
hope
to
see
replaced
soon
by
something
a
little
more
artistic
say
in
such
a
room
as
the
one
i
have
just
described
by
a
dull
brown
cloth
which
surely
would
be
every
bit
as
satisfactory
as
the
green
which
is
certainly
the
most
aggressive
shade
of
green
which
has
ever
been
made
in
this
case
the
shades
could
be
blue
with
some
lace
over
them
or
the
yellow
with
no
lace
at
all
where
the
ceiling
is
coved
the
coving
should
always
be
decorated
either
with
gold
leather
paper
or
by
an
brush
and
i
have
seen
most
elaborately
drawn
pictures
of
the
old
wooden
ships
of
henry
time
in
a
similar
coving
in
sepia
on
a
cream
ground
which
looked
perfectly
beautiful
and
which
i
should
recommend
in
a
similar
room
where
heads
and
other
trophies
of
the
chase
should
be
arranged
on
the
painted
wall
which
should
be
too
high
for
pictures
which
could
not
be
hung
on
the
dado
either
for
fear
of
their
being
damaged
by
the
ends
of
the
cues
i
should
advise
the
use
of
printed
yellow
linen
for
curtains
edged
of
course
with
ball
fringe
were
there
any
windows
in
the
room
beside
the
which
should
have
a
gathered
soft
yellow
blind
arranged
to
draw
over
it
in
very
hot
weather
while
the
table
itself
when
not
in
use
should
be
covered
with
a
large
square
of
yellow
serge
lined
with
american
cloth
with
a
big
monogram
embroidered
on
one
corner
this
would
preserve
the
table
and
look
much
better
than
the
ordinary
cloth
the
floor
should
be
parqueterie
with
strips
of
velvet
pile
carpet
in
golden
brown
on
the
four
sides
these
should
be
mitred
at
the
corners
and
no
other
carpet
would
be
required
save
of
course
a
square
if
we
had
the
end
to
the
room
i
advocated
before
if
not
the
room
should
be
kept
for
billiards
only
when
the
strips
round
the
table
would
be
quite
sufficient
the
leather
seats
should
be
covered
in
brown
leather
and
the
fire
should
be
protected
by
one
of
the
admirable
guards
sold
by
benham
and
which
have
padded
tops
on
which
people
can
sit
and
watch
the
game
and
get
comfortably
warm
at
the
same
time
i
have
seen
a
most
ingenious
arrangement
of
small
cupboards
in
the
overmantel
of
a
which
was
pronounced
invaluable
for
the
safe
storing
away
of
cigars
and
tobacco
which
should
be
mentioned
as
of
course
smoking
will
be
principally
carried
on
in
this
room
the
was
walnut
and
the
fireplace
the
orthodox
open
grate
and
tiled
hearth
and
back
the
overmantel
was
carved
to
match
the
mantel
and
was
quite
flat
to
the
wall
which
had
been
scooped
out
in
some
manner
behind
it
to
allow
of
the
formation
of
sundry
square
cupboards
in
the
wall
itself
these
each
held
a
box
of
cigars
with
the
front
end
off
and
the
cigars
were
so
arranged
that
they
could
be
taken
out
one
by
one
when
the
square
wooden
block
in
the
overmantel
which
formed
the
entrance
to
the
cupboard
was
unlocked
and
fell
forward
on
a
hinge
no
one
could
have
suspected
the
overmantel
of
being
a
cupboard
and
yet
it
was
one
while
at
the
same
time
this
particular
spot
was
especially
pleasing
i
believe
to
the
constitution
of
a
cigar
which
appears
to
require
a
certain
amount
of
warmth
until
it
disappears
finally
into
smoke
leaving
its
terrible
odour
behind
it
on
the
itself
were
dull
blue
vases
holding
spills
several
ingenious
and
expensive
on
which
all
matches
appeared
to
me
to
refuse
to
ignite
and
the
usual
one
always
finds
in
similar
localities
pipes
old
date
stands
and
stands
for
holding
the
hunt
appointments
and
similar
expensive
and
broken
toys
being
there
in
vast
abundance
another
excellent
manner
of
decorating
a
where
the
owner
had
pictures
to
dispose
of
and
did
not
want
a
very
elaborate
or
costly
decoration
would
be
formed
by
papering
the
room
entirely
with
real
brown
paper
and
painting
the
room
the
same
soft
brown
a
frieze
should
be
added
if
possible
of
one
of
the
japanese
friezes
one
can
buy
occasionally
at
any
representing
a
flight
of
wild
ducks
or
else
of
storks
among
reeds
and
flowers
but
if
this
can
not
be
either
found
or
afforded
a
plain
gold
and
brown
japanese
leather
frieze
would
look
well
this
should
not
be
less
than
fourteen
inches
wide
anything
less
is
distinctly
ugly
while
it
might
come
almost
to
the
top
of
the
door
which
should
be
surmounted
by
one
of
simple
to
hold
china
which
should
be
blue
and
white
the
curtains
in
this
room
should
be
very
dark
blue
and
white
reversible
cretonnes
the
chairs
could
be
either
dark
blue
leather
or
with
dark
blue
velvet
surrounds
and
the
carpet
should
be
dark
blue
pile
this
would
look
well
and
be
an
entirely
pleasant
scheme
of
decoration
a
frieze
on
brown
paper
would
also
be
capital
if
expense
were
no
object
yet
another
and
a
bolder
decoration
could
be
made
by
using
essex
golden
paper
with
mandarin
paint
and
a
wide
frieze
of
the
dull
green
dull
green
carpets
and
graham
beautiful
yellow
poppy
cretonne
edged
with
dull
green
ball
fringe
and
lined
dull
green
the
carpet
should
be
the
dull
green
pile
carpet
from
and
all
the
chairs
should
be
dull
green
leather
if
by
chance
there
can
be
afforded
or
managed
a
end
to
the
a
couple
of
screens
will
be
found
most
invaluable
and
if
these
screens
have
a
long
spike
in
each
fold
to
receive
which
a
corresponding
hole
is
bored
in
the
floor
a
great
objection
to
screens
will
be
done
away
with
furnished
with
these
spikes
which
should
be
able
to
be
unscrewed
and
removed
quite
easily
they
could
not
possibly
be
knocked
over
and
in
my
opinion
the
tall
standard
lamps
which
are
so
much
in
request
just
at
present
should
be
furnished
with
similar
spikes
as
they
always
appear
to
me
dreadfully
dangerous
especially
where
there
are
children
or
even
dogs
or
careless
servants
for
though
of
course
the
danger
of
fire
is
entirely
done
away
with
if
we
use
excellent
patent
for
putting
out
the
light
as
the
lamp
falls
the
oil
must
be
spilt
and
damage
the
carpet
while
an
unpleasant
smash
and
fright
are
absolutely
certain
we
should
be
saved
anything
of
the
kind
were
my
simple
spike
arrangement
adopted
by
all
those
who
use
these
lamps
the
end
of
the
should
have
a
bow
window
with
a
seat
round
several
cosy
a
table
capable
of
holding
the
supply
of
newspapers
and
the
supply
of
magazines
each
in
its
own
proper
corner
and
a
couple
of
serviceable
should
be
always
forthcoming
there
should
be
a
nice
little
for
the
use
of
any
who
wish
to
scribble
notes
and
above
all
there
should
be
either
a
long
bookcase
on
the
wall
full
of
frivolous
literature
or
else
one
of
excellent
bookcases
which
revolve
and
so
allow
one
to
reach
any
book
in
the
case
without
rising
from
comfortable
seat
a
venerable
piano
which
has
seen
better
days
is
no
mean
addition
to
the
comfort
and
pleasure
of
the
and
many
an
hilarious
and
impromptu
entertainment
has
chased
away
the
melancholy
caused
by
a
wet
afternoon
in
the
dismal
winter
country
due
entirely
to
the
happy
presence
among
the
company
of
a
piano
which
was
quite
good
enough
to
be
used
to
accompany
comic
songs
on
and
amply
good
enough
to
form
the
basis
for
a
recitation
after
a
long
way
after
corney
grain
or
the
immortal
john
parry
but
though
a
big
room
is
much
better
than
a
small
one
for
billiards
people
should
not
be
deterred
from
having
a
table
in
their
houses
because
their
space
does
not
allow
of
a
one
the
very
nicest
i
was
ever
in
and
which
alas
is
now
no
more
was
that
formed
by
using
the
square
hall
of
a
country
vicarage
that
table
existed
before
the
present
age
of
artistic
decorations
but
whenever
i
remember
it
and
the
dear
old
house
in
which
it
stood
i
forget
all
art
and
only
remember
the
extreme
fascination
that
place
had
for
me
and
can
scent
again
the
mingled
odours
of
the
pipes
and
marÃ©chal
niel
roses
which
are
inseparable
from
my
remembrance
of
the
place
the
table
stood
squarely
in
the
front
hall
which
was
covered
with
brown
linoleum
and
was
seldom
unmarked
by
feet
for
more
than
five
minutes
after
it
had
been
freshly
washed
and
we
used
to
perch
about
on
the
tops
of
oak
chests
the
fender
anywhere
while
the
game
progressed
as
there
was
no
room
for
seats
in
addition
to
the
hall
table
the
decorated
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
hats
male
and
female
and
the
oak
chests
one
of
which
held
the
rugs
and
whips
the
other
the
parish
registers
from
some
very
bygone
date
the
walls
themselves
were
decorated
with
stuffed
birds
and
animals
in
glass
cases
sundry
collars
and
chains
belonging
to
the
dear
dogs
suspended
in
some
cunning
manner
to
keep
them
in
shape
a
barometer
which
survived
the
most
fearful
amount
of
banging
and
shaking
that
ever
barometer
was
subjected
to
and
finally
by
the
which
hung
from
a
nail
until
it
was
fetched
by
a
small
village
girl
who
rejoiced
in
the
remarkable
name
of
jemimy
who
had
to
take
and
fetch
the
bag
morning
and
evening
from
the
end
the
bringing
it
and
taking
it
from
and
to
that
mysterious
location
for
we
were
far
too
primitive
in
those
parts
to
have
a
postman
and
had
our
one
post
a
day
contentedly
enough
though
i
believe
the
present
denizen
of
the
vicarage
has
clamoured
until
he
has
not
only
a
postman
but
a
second
post
albeit
neither
were
ever
required
by
us
who
were
perfectly
happy
in
those
blessed
days
without
them
i
dwell
upon
this
room
rather
at
length
in
order
to
encourage
anyone
who
may
hanker
after
a
and
not
dare
to
think
of
it
seriously
because
the
necessary
twenty
feet
by
twenty
space
is
not
forthcoming
and
moreover
because
they
dread
the
expense
as
much
as
the
want
of
room
of
course
a
new
table
is
a
very
expensive
thing
and
fittings
and
all
could
not
cost
less
than
but
as
soon
as
we
have
made
up
our
minds
that
we
can
really
have
a
we
must
begin
to
look
out
for
the
sales
for
very
often
there
are
compulsory
sales
about
where
a
very
good
can
be
purchased
for
a
quarter
the
price
of
a
new
one
i
have
known
one
sold
for
as
the
owner
had
forgotten
to
renew
his
lease
and
was
given
summary
notice
of
dismissal
while
a
friend
of
mine
bought
a
beauty
for
which
simply
required
a
little
polish
about
the
legs
to
be
quite
as
good
as
new
but
should
money
be
of
no
real
object
it
would
be
better
to
go
to
some
really
maker
and
have
the
table
properly
set
up
and
made
for
i
believe
there
is
great
art
in
the
proper
placing
of
the
table
and
this
should
only
be
undertaken
by
someone
who
thoroughly
understands
the
business
still
in
a
small
room
and
with
a
small
and
table
there
may
be
found
vast
enjoyment
if
the
bigger
and
more
elaborate
arrangement
can
not
possibly
be
managed
i
am
always
amused
at
some
determination
not
to
be
either
happy
or
in
their
household
arrangements
because
they
can
not
have
the
best
of
everything
that
is
to
be
had
though
i
must
confess
such
conduct
makes
me
just
a
little
cross
as
well
i
have
known
folks
utterly
refuse
to
contemplate
the
joys
of
a
jolly
little
pony
and
chaise
because
they
care
to
set
up
a
carriage
unless
they
could
do
so
properly
in
their
case
meaning
the
orthodox
coachman
footman
horses
and
a
couple
of
carriages
whereas
they
condemned
themselves
to
their
own
immediate
neighbourhood
and
to
tramping
about
the
lanes
or
to
staying
at
home
because
they
could
not
understand
that
as
much
pleasure
could
be
got
out
of
the
as
out
of
anything
still
more
gorgeous
i
have
known
folks
decline
with
scorn
to
cover
their
ugly
depressing
bare
walls
with
pictures
because
they
could
not
buy
millais
and
herkomers
whereas
their
lives
and
their
houses
would
have
been
brightened
at
once
had
they
spent
on
autotypes
and
i
have
as
constantly
been
acquainted
with
dozens
of
folks
who
would
not
do
this
that
or
the
other
because
they
must
take
a
back
seat
so
to
speak
and
who
in
consequence
waste
half
their
opportunities
i
except
society
by
the
way
if
the
best
society
is
not
forthcoming
and
by
the
best
society
i
mean
the
society
of
people
who
are
clever
and
who
have
done
or
long
to
do
something
to
make
the
world
brighter
and
happier
than
they
found
it
have
any
the
contact
with
mean
small
and
ignorant
minds
does
one
harm
not
good
the
constant
rubbing
against
shoulders
and
the
shoulders
of
those
who
would
do
any
amount
of
grovelling
to
be
received
by
what
they
consider
the
society
of
the
neighbourhood
only
smirches
us
and
we
had
better
sit
at
home
all
our
lives
with
our
books
alone
than
expose
ourselves
to
the
deterioration
we
receive
from
association
with
such
folk
but
apart
from
society
i
would
rather
have
the
second
or
third
best
of
everything
if
i
have
the
first
for
the
more
one
gets
out
of
life
the
better
and
the
more
one
sees
of
the
world
and
of
the
nice
people
in
it
the
wider
do
our
minds
become
and
the
more
appreciation
and
enjoyment
do
we
have
from
our
lives
with
the
plea
for
a
secondhand
rather
than
none
i
will
turn
away
from
the
room
with
one
last
suggestion
viz
to
have
good
thick
curtains
hung
over
any
doors
that
there
may
be
in
the
room
outside
this
will
keep
the
smell
of
the
smoke
within
proper
bounds
and
will
also
keep
out
the
sound
of
the
of
the
balls
than
which
nothing
is
more
annoying
to
me
at
any
rate
these
curtains
could
be
made
of
adams
serge
lined
with
bolton
sheeting
both
these
materials
will
wash
and
are
to
be
had
from
and
should
be
very
wide
and
full
and
should
hang
well
over
the
hinges
and
cracks
of
the
door
these
should
further
be
surrounded
by
for
excluding
draughts
as
naturally
the
room
will
be
properly
ventilated
and
there
would
be
no
need
to
think
of
that
all
our
care
being
centred
on
keeping
in
the
room
all
scent
of
the
smoke
and
all
sound
of
the
balls
if
the
room
is
separate
from
the
house
and
only
connected
with
it
by
a
long
passage
we
may
consider
i
think
that
nothing
more
is
to
be
expected
and
that
here
is
indeed
the
perfect
this
room
should
be
in
the
care
of
the
head
housemaid
whose
first
duty
should
be
to
open
all
the
available
windows
every
morning
no
matter
what
the
weather
is
like
to
see
all
the
is
swept
up
and
finally
to
slip
the
curtains
off
the
poles
a
matter
of
three
minutes
exactly
to
have
them
well
shaken
out
of
doors
and
left
there
for
half
an
hour
having
them
replaced
the
moment
the
room
is
cleaned
and
set
straight
treated
like
this
the
would
always
be
fresh
and
nice
and
would
have
no
more
smell
of
smoke
about
it
than
would
be
pleasantly
suggestive
to
anyone
who
is
not
such
a
bitter
enemy
to
smoke
as
i
am
and
now
about
the
library
the
arrangement
of
which
must
depend
entirely
on
the
individual
tastes
and
pursuits
of
the
master
of
the
house
whose
room
this
is
more
especially
for
in
all
big
houses
the
mistress
has
her
and
the
guests
generally
are
provided
with
in
their
rooms
and
would
only
venture
into
the
library
when
the
door
was
open
or
by
the
rule
of
the
house
was
made
free
to
them
during
certain
hours
naturally
if
the
master
were
in
no
measure
a
literary
man
if
he
had
no
parliamentary
work
or
work
that
required
him
to
isolate
himself
from
the
rest
of
the
household
at
certain
hours
the
room
would
always
be
free
but
it
should
be
kept
for
writing
and
reading
only
it
should
never
be
turned
into
a
of
any
kind
therefore
there
should
be
a
certain
sobriety
about
it
and
it
should
not
be
furnished
too
frivolously
or
in
such
a
manner
as
to
suggest
flirtation
instead
of
study
sweet
sleep
instead
of
proper
severe
application
to
books
perhaps
the
very
prettiest
library
i
have
ever
seen
is
one
in
london
which
may
sound
frivolous
but
is
nothing
of
the
kind
and
has
some
of
the
most
serious
work
of
the
nation
done
between
its
four
walls
it
is
enamelled
white
doors
cupboards
bookshelves
overmantel
indeed
everything
and
has
a
most
beautiful
effect
especially
against
the
calf
volumes
with
which
the
shelves
are
most
amply
supplied
the
shelves
are
supported
on
cupboards
with
brass
locks
and
hinges
and
are
wide
and
deep
enough
to
hold
quantities
of
law
papers
all
these
shelves
and
cupboards
are
passing
completely
round
the
room
and
continuing
under
the
windows
the
only
scraps
of
wall
which
show
are
papered
with
a
very
good
japanese
leather
paper
and
the
space
above
the
is
filled
in
with
an
old
portrait
sundry
pieces
of
blue
china
are
on
the
which
are
never
without
their
fresh
flowers
the
carpet
is
a
very
fine
oriental
one
with
a
great
deal
of
white
in
it
the
furniture
is
blue
as
are
the
curtains
which
are
arranged
across
the
top
of
each
window
and
down
one
side
only
while
the
enormous
desk
which
occupies
the
centre
of
the
room
is
a
most
exquisitely
inlaid
piece
of
marqueterie
and
is
the
only
coloured
thing
in
the
room
the
frames
of
the
chairs
being
enamelled
like
the
room
itself
now
this
white
idea
for
a
library
in
london
dirty
smoky
london
does
seem
absurd
and
a
trifle
frivolous
but
the
effect
thereof
is
perfect
and
as
the
application
of
a
damp
clean
duster
and
a
polish
from
a
leather
makes
the
room
absolutely
spotless
i
see
no
reason
why
the
white
library
should
be
scoffed
at
as
an
impossibility
a
big
beaten
iron
and
copper
lamp
from
strode
hangs
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
gives
the
finishing
touch
to
a
very
perfect
apartment
here
the
room
is
used
for
important
work
which
requires
absolute
peace
and
absolute
solitude
where
the
books
refer
to
the
special
subject
of
study
and
would
be
of
no
interest
whatever
to
the
ordinary
man
still
a
modified
edition
of
the
white
room
could
easily
be
carried
out
and
would
be
far
more
cheerful
to
live
with
than
the
orthodox
dark
green
and
carved
oak
or
a
base
imitation
thereof
that
we
find
in
far
too
many
houses
oak
in
my
opinion
being
utterly
unsuited
to
a
modern
house
and
should
only
be
used
in
a
big
old
house
where
one
looks
for
it
as
a
matter
of
course
of
the
modern
imitation
called
flemish
oak
i
have
no
words
of
condemnation
sufficiently
strong
it
is
abominable
ugly
heavy
and
badly
executed
and
should
never
be
tolerated
in
any
house
where
artistic
decoration
is
encouraged
and
sought
after
if
as
i
said
before
the
master
of
the
house
does
not
require
so
much
space
for
papers
or
books
as
to
authorise
him
to
cover
in
the
entire
at
his
command
with
fitments
i
advise
him
to
run
his
bookcases
simply
round
the
room
to
a
height
of
an
ordinary
dado
above
this
could
be
hung
the
japanese
paper
or
a
real
paper
such
as
is
on
the
wall
could
be
hung
pictures
or
a
large
cupboard
well
designed
and
i
should
suggest
arthur
smee
as
the
proper
person
to
send
to
for
this
should
break
the
space
of
wall
in
the
centre
the
doors
could
be
of
cathedral
glass
in
leaded
squares
with
broad
brass
hinges
and
locks
while
the
same
design
of
course
on
a
much
smaller
scale
could
be
introduced
over
the
the
desk
could
be
enamelled
white
and
the
top
covered
with
japanese
leather
paper
of
course
the
handles
on
the
drawers
must
be
brass
the
could
be
of
red
leather
with
a
plain
monogram
stamped
on
or
else
the
name
of
the
room
and
of
the
house
and
the
head
housemaid
should
be
very
particular
about
the
state
of
the
inkstand
and
of
the
though
she
should
be
forbidden
of
course
to
touch
any
of
the
papers
on
the
desk
for
fear
she
might
lose
important
manuscripts
the
mistress
of
the
house
should
dust
these
herself
if
the
master
is
touchy
or
objects
to
other
hands
meddling
with
his
belongings
the
curtains
in
a
library
should
be
thick
and
warm
and
should
in
the
room
be
in
cream
roman
satin
embroidered
with
red
flowers
if
possible
or
else
of
deep
red
roman
satin
or
bokhara
plush
the
furniture
sold
by
hampton
covered
in
what
they
call
but
which
is
quite
unlike
the
ordinary
striped
material
i
have
always
purchased
as
such
and
is
much
more
would
do
admirably
in
this
room
where
there
should
certainly
be
a
couple
of
good
sofas
and
four
or
five
armchairs
and
a
small
and
chair
beside
the
bigger
one
while
great
care
should
be
taken
with
the
lighting
it
being
most
important
that
a
good
light
should
fall
on
the
book
or
which
should
throw
no
fidgety
shadows
when
the
electric
light
becomes
general
this
advice
will
not
be
necessary
but
until
it
is
great
care
must
be
taken
before
the
lights
are
absolutely
fixtures
to
ascertain
that
they
are
in
the
right
place
or
else
the
unfortunate
readers
and
writers
will
be
continually
annoyed
the
large
standard
lamps
are
useful
in
a
library
as
they
can
be
moved
at
any
moment
and
further
care
should
be
taken
in
the
choice
of
a
carpet
which
should
be
thick
and
soft
and
should
cover
almost
all
the
floor
thus
saving
the
student
any
chance
of
being
fidgeted
by
the
sudden
scroop
of
a
chair
pushed
hastily
back
or
by
the
noise
of
a
falling
book
or
of
a
sudden
footstep
in
a
small
house
a
library
would
be
impossible
and
therefore
i
give
no
directions
for
a
cheaper
style
of
decoration
which
however
could
be
managed
in
judiciously
chosen
shades
of
green
and
white
and
i
will
only
now
speak
about
the
books
and
the
manner
of
treating
such
a
room
no
child
or
very
young
person
and
no
servant
no
matter
whom
should
ever
be
allowed
to
read
the
library
books
which
should
never
under
any
pretext
whatever
be
removed
from
the
library
and
should
consist
of
histories
travels
poetry
and
all
standard
works
that
have
survived
the
fiery
trial
of
a
twenty
existence
the
lighter
works
of
which
one
reads
when
one
is
tired
or
wants
simply
to
be
amused
should
be
found
in
the
billiard
and
morning
rooms
and
in
every
spare
room
in
the
house
books
being
also
in
these
rooms
and
on
no
account
whatever
should
a
really
good
book
which
forms
part
of
a
set
or
is
valuable
be
lent
listen
to
no
entreaties
place
the
book
the
at
the
disposal
of
anyone
who
cares
to
read
it
but
lend
it
and
you
may
and
will
run
the
risk
of
losing
your
book
or
of
having
to
torment
for
it
until
your
friend
hates
you
although
in
strict
justice
he
ought
to
hate
himself
for
the
trouble
he
has
given
you
in
every
library
and
indeed
in
every
house
there
should
be
a
list
of
the
books
in
each
room
and
whenever
a
book
is
added
the
name
thereof
should
be
written
down
i
speak
feelingly
if
a
little
bitterly
on
the
subject
for
no
one
has
lent
more
books
than
i
have
and
no
one
has
been
more
ruthlessly
robbed
for
people
who
would
be
absolutely
incapable
of
depriving
one
of
a
pin
lose
and
forget
to
return
my
books
and
at
last
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
will
never
lend
another
books
are
cheap
enough
goodness
knows
and
libraries
swarm
let
people
borrow
there
and
close
your
heart
to
the
borrower
if
you
want
to
keep
your
books
and
not
scatter
them
generously
about
the
world
at
large
again
i
should
never
forbid
anyone
to
read
any
book
whatever
a
prohibition
makes
people
anxious
at
once
but
the
fact
that
the
library
books
must
be
kept
in
the
library
would
deter
the
children
from
reading
what
they
ought
not
and
we
would
forbid
certain
literature
because
of
its
binding
not
because
of
the
contents
this
i
have
found
act
much
better
than
the
wholesale
orders
we
were
given
on
the
subject
in
consequence
of
which
i
had
read
all
and
other
works
i
should
never
have
seen
before
i
was
sixteen
and
wondered
why
on
earth
they
were
forbidden
me
i
should
never
have
read
one
of
them
had
i
not
wanted
to
see
why
i
must
not
they
did
me
no
harm
because
i
could
not
understand
them
they
might
have
done
infinite
harm
to
any
other
girl
who
was
less
babyish
for
her
age
than
i
happened
in
some
mysterious
manner
to
be
and
therefore
it
is
a
good
thing
to
keep
such
books
where
children
do
not
come
and
where
they
are
forbidden
to
touch
books
which
are
too
well
bound
to
be
risked
in
their
grimy
little
paws
as
in
all
the
other
rooms
in
the
house
cheerfulness
should
be
first
thought
of
a
gloomy
library
a
library
where
the
windows
are
obscured
is
a
mistake
cheerfulness
is
the
first
thing
to
be
seriously
cultivated
by
us
all
in
all
relations
of
life
for
it
is
indeed
true
as
the
poet
says
a
merry
heart
goes
all
the
way
a
sad
one
tires
in
a
therefore
in
choosing
and
furnishing
the
library
remember
this
axiom
and
let
sunshine
and
brightness
and
cheerfulness
be
found
there
as
in
every
other
room
and
place
in
the
house
for
we
are
insensibly
and
immensely
influenced
by
our
surroundings
and
we
should
always
make
the
best
of
our
lives
and
belongings
in
every
way
we
possibly
can
chapter
shall
we
do
away
with
the
nursery
it
is
a
hard
moment
in
the
life
of
any
woman
when
she
has
to
make
up
her
mind
that
she
can
not
any
longer
consistently
retain
one
of
the
best
rooms
in
the
house
for
the
nursery
more
especially
if
she
has
been
able
to
realise
her
ambition
and
to
give
to
her
children
an
ideal
chamber
where
beauty
and
suitable
arrangements
for
their
comfort
have
been
duly
studied
i
know
nothing
sadder
than
an
empty
nursery
the
children
who
were
as
much
our
own
as
anything
on
this
earth
can
ever
be
have
ceased
to
be
children
they
are
still
ours
but
they
are
independent
creatures
our
care
is
no
longer
absolutely
necessary
to
them
some
may
even
have
married
and
others
may
be
trying
their
wings
by
some
short
flights
from
the
home
that
will
always
be
theirs
even
if
they
do
not
care
to
return
to
it
but
in
any
case
they
are
no
longer
the
dear
little
mites
whose
tiny
ailments
kept
us
awake
at
night
whose
clothes
and
education
were
our
unceasing
care
and
who
found
their
heaven
in
our
presence
believing
honestly
and
thankfully
that
all
they
had
came
from
us
and
that
we
were
without
a
flaw
as
omnipotent
as
we
were
faultless
the
most
melancholy
part
of
middle
age
is
this
being
left
behind
by
our
children
the
eagerness
on
their
parts
to
live
their
own
lives
and
begin
their
own
career
but
it
should
not
be
sad
as
it
is
only
what
happened
to
our
parents
after
all
and
will
happen
again
in
the
future
generation
but
all
the
same
it
must
be
a
hardened
heart
indeed
that
can
contemplate
an
empty
nursery
and
have
no
other
thoughts
than
how
best
to
decorate
or
use
the
room
for
a
totally
different
purpose
there
is
a
peculiar
de
which
once
experienced
can
never
be
forgotten
when
we
enter
a
room
made
sacred
to
us
by
a
thousand
dreams
and
romances
a
thousand
dreads
and
fears
we
have
never
spoken
of
to
any
soul
on
earth
and
have
to
consider
how
best
we
can
alter
it
to
another
purpose
i
remember
years
ago
going
to
see
a
house
in
which
we
had
had
many
many
happy
hours
and
which
had
just
passed
from
those
we
knew
and
loved
to
persons
in
an
inferior
station
of
life
with
whom
we
should
never
have
any
dealings
and
i
have
never
forgotten
the
feeling
of
desolation
that
seized
me
when
i
looked
up
at
the
erstwhile
nursery
window
from
which
the
bars
were
hanging
broken
and
remembered
the
faces
that
used
never
to
be
absent
from
that
place
a
feeling
that
was
intensified
a
thousand
times
when
i
climbed
up
to
the
room
itself
and
looked
for
the
last
time
on
the
walls
papered
by
ourselves
with
pictures
from
the
i
can
remember
them
all
vividly
from
the
marriage
of
the
princess
royal
in
one
corner
to
pictures
of
the
american
war
in
the
other
and
recollected
the
boys
who
were
all
out
in
the
world
each
busy
with
his
own
life
with
whom
i
had
played
ridden
eaten
far
too
much
fruit
in
the
sunny
garden
below
the
nursery
windows
where
i
verily
believe
it
was
always
fine
and
hot
and
with
whom
i
had
risen
at
dawn
in
many
a
misty
september
morning
bent
on
collecting
a
great
dish
of
mushrooms
for
breakfast
to
surprise
the
with
a
surprise
that
she
must
have
been
well
accustomed
to
but
which
she
never
failed
to
express
she
knew
we
should
have
been
so
disappointed
had
she
seemed
in
the
least
degree
to
expect
the
dish
though
she
had
a
hard
struggle
to
be
duly
elated
and
not
say
one
word
about
the
draggled
skirts
and
wringing
wet
stockings
and
boots
which
she
knew
were
reposing
upstairs
and
would
be
shown
to
her
in
due
course
and
with
much
wrath
by
susan
to
whose
lot
it
always
fell
to
remedy
our
dilapidations
which
she
used
to
say
were
always
worse
when
i
was
there
to
rush
about
with
the
boys
and
lead
them
into
mischief
and
dirt
of
all
kinds
there
can
be
nothing
more
extinct
on
this
earth
than
that
dear
old
nursery
closed
nearly
twenty
years
ago
and
utterly
swept
away
but
i
can
never
think
of
it
without
becoming
young
again
without
being
the
eldest
of
that
small
flock
and
worshipped
as
only
five
small
boys
can
worship
a
london
cousin
much
older
than
themselves
who
yet
could
enter
into
all
their
games
and
excursions
with
the
zest
of
a
girl
who
has
never
tried
living
in
the
country
and
sees
only
the
poetical
side
of
it
and
without
remembering
the
happiest
of
happy
homes
where
i
can
not
recollect
a
cross
word
a
disagreeable
day
or
anything
but
the
noise
of
the
boys
rushing
about
the
scent
of
a
thousand
flowers
the
planning
of
a
hundred
picnics
and
a
delightful
sense
of
summer
and
sunshine
that
can
never
be
forgotten
and
that
has
influenced
more
lives
than
mine
more
even
than
the
generous
hospitable
master
and
mistress
will
ever
know
though
perhaps
he
does
in
the
rest
he
won
so
worthily
and
in
the
heaven
that
must
hold
anyone
who
was
as
generous
and
good
as
he
was
to
the
many
many
relations
with
whom
he
filled
his
house
and
to
whom
he
always
gave
a
hearty
welcome
but
no
doubt
there
are
a
great
many
other
nurseries
just
like
this
one
and
indeed
i
know
of
several
so
i
would
beg
my
readers
to
bear
with
me
while
i
speak
of
these
rooms
and
beg
them
not
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
the
nursery
altogether
until
they
are
positively
obliged
to
do
so
not
because
there
may
be
other
babies
to
come
but
because
the
nursery
is
useful
for
a
thousand
things
and
it
makes
such
a
dreadful
difference
in
a
house
when
the
room
is
completely
altered
and
turned
into
a
room
for
the
maid
who
takes
the
place
of
the
nurse
perhaps
or
into
a
for
the
girls
or
boys
let
this
be
done
dear
readers
until
you
are
absolutely
crowded
out
because
you
will
be
miserable
and
because
you
can
never
tell
that
the
room
may
not
be
wanted
as
a
sanitorium
an
upstairs
a
refuge
for
our
grandchildren
should
we
have
married
children
and
should
they
be
coming
to
stay
with
us
and
bring
their
babies
in
due
course
of
time
while
the
room
having
been
decorated
and
furnished
as
a
nursery
is
that
and
nothing
else
and
would
have
to
be
completely
altered
should
we
settle
to
do
away
with
it
altogether
now
i
want
you
to
look
just
for
a
moment
at
the
picture
i
have
had
drawn
here
of
an
empty
nursery
and
see
how
admirably
it
is
adapted
for
the
purpose
and
how
cruel
it
would
be
to
sweep
away
all
these
corners
and
shelves
you
will
notice
how
the
cupboard
fills
in
the
recess
between
the
fire
and
the
wall
and
you
will
see
how
a
should
be
arranged
and
then
i
am
sure
you
will
think
twice
about
weeding
out
all
this
and
doing
away
with
things
that
may
give
pleasure
to
future
generations
particularly
when
we
must
all
number
among
our
acquaintances
people
with
children
who
come
to
tea
and
will
enjoy
their
tea
twice
as
much
if
the
children
can
be
relegated
to
old
nurse
and
the
room
where
all
is
prepared
for
the
small
guests
who
will
for
the
moment
take
the
place
of
those
who
are
still
children
to
us
albeit
they
are
as
old
as
we
were
when
we
began
housekeeping
ourselves
and
set
up
a
nursery
with
the
pride
and
consequence
inseparable
from
that
most
important
step
while
we
can
look
hopefully
forward
to
other
small
visitors
who
will
be
delighted
to
play
with
old
toys
and
to
hear
things
about
that
childhood
which
can
only
be
told
them
by
an
authority
on
the
subject
the
nursery
i
have
had
sketched
here
is
of
course
a
much
more
expensive
and
elaborate
room
than
could
be
suggested
to
folks
with
small
incomes
but
will
serve
as
an
example
i
hope
even
in
little
houses
although
as
those
were
amply
catered
for
in
my
first
book
i
do
not
feel
so
bound
to
consider
them
as
i
did
then
i
should
always
have
a
real
dado
in
any
nursery
the
one
used
here
is
of
indian
matting
which
is
as
neat
and
clean
after
ten
use
as
it
was
the
day
it
was
put
up
by
the
way
a
dado
should
be
secured
at
the
top
with
rather
a
heavier
rail
than
the
one
illustrated
and
this
should
be
screwed
on
not
nailed
the
screws
can
be
removed
at
any
moment
and
the
dado
taken
down
in
the
case
of
a
cretonne
dado
this
could
be
washed
at
any
moment
while
stuff
or
matting
could
be
brushed
or
shaken
but
i
have
taken
down
matting
after
ten
years
on
a
wall
which
was
sized
before
the
matting
was
put
up
and
have
never
found
the
smallest
dirt
behind
it
while
the
wall
remained
absolutely
intact
for
that
space
of
time
and
indeed
is
as
good
as
new
now
after
fifteen
wear
at
least
i
hear
it
is
unfortunately
we
have
moved
twice
since
then
and
i
can
not
possibly
inspect
the
matting
to
verify
this
statement
for
myself
as
i
should
like
to
do
but
ten
years
is
a
long
time
and
in
these
roving
days
of
ours
when
all
too
rarely
do
houses
descend
from
father
to
son
is
quite
space
enough
for
most
of
us
above
the
matting
which
should
be
the
kind
sold
by
treloar
in
ludgate
circus
for
the
roll
of
yards
can
be
put
any
pretty
blue
paper
new
blue
paper
at
is
charming
and
is
of
a
colour
that
illustration
fig
an
empty
nursery
we
never
tire
of
the
paint
could
be
the
same
shade
of
blue
the
tiny
cornice
should
be
coloured
cream
and
the
ceiling
paper
should
be
cheap
yellow
and
white
one
at
a
piece
this
could
be
cleaned
twice
a
year
with
stale
bread
and
as
it
is
so
cheap
could
be
replaced
the
moment
it
showed
signs
of
becoming
in
the
least
degree
shabby
the
best
toys
could
be
arranged
round
the
room
on
the
shelf
which
could
be
painted
blue
and
further
appropriate
decorations
could
be
made
by
tennis
rackets
and
skipping
ropes
if
desired
albeit
i
should
prefer
a
picture
there
of
some
kind
or
other
or
else
a
lamp
hanging
out
over
the
fireplace
beyond
the
reach
of
little
fingers
which
might
hanker
after
the
fascinating
occupation
of
lowering
the
light
or
putting
it
up
to
such
an
extent
that
the
glass
might
be
smashed
in
less
than
no
time
the
short
curtains
and
absence
of
blinds
which
i
always
advocate
and
which
idea
has
been
largely
copied
and
adopted
are
just
indicated
in
the
picture
as
is
the
long
straight
seat
under
the
windows
which
would
take
the
place
of
the
sofa
if
there
were
not
room
for
one
but
the
useful
serge
or
arras
cloth
should
be
used
instead
of
cretonne
here
as
cretonne
so
soon
gets
out
of
order
in
a
place
which
is
so
much
used
as
such
a
might
be
corduroy
velveteen
would
also
make
an
admirable
covering
and
would
always
be
in
a
measure
tidy
it
is
possible
to
make
these
do
double
duty
as
a
seat
and
also
as
a
box
for
instead
of
the
front
being
a
mockery
as
it
is
when
it
is
a
simple
frill
and
nothing
else
it
could
be
a
wooden
box
and
the
seat
could
be
a
padded
lid
which
could
lift
up
and
down
a
small
frill
nailed
on
the
top
of
the
seat
would
conceal
the
opening
and
the
front
of
the
box
could
be
covered
with
frilled
material
like
small
organ
pipes
this
would
hold
any
quantity
of
work
old
books
magazines
and
rubbish
generally
rubbish
which
is
of
no
use
at
all
but
is
absolutely
priceless
to
the
little
owners
i
think
anyone
who
has
ever
owned
a
will
admire
my
idea
for
a
fixed
one
because
all
who
have
ever
possessed
a
similar
abode
must
have
occasionally
pulled
it
down
about
the
ears
when
engaged
in
an
orthodox
game
with
this
most
fascinating
toy
at
least
it
used
to
be
fascinating
in
my
day
judging
from
my
two
girls
no
one
can
care
now
for
them
for
the
beauty
we
had
has
long
since
gone
to
a
hospital
owing
to
the
absolute
indifference
with
which
its
many
charms
were
treated
by
our
children
but
if
there
still
exist
any
small
maidens
who
treat
their
houses
as
we
used
to
i
am
sure
this
arrangement
of
cupboard
shelves
with
a
real
house
front
and
a
flap
to
let
down
properly
painted
of
course
like
a
hall
door
with
windows
above
must
commend
itself
to
them
the
flap
makes
a
table
for
meals
and
parties
and
is
very
useful
for
house
cleaning
which
delightful
occupation
invariably
occurred
in
my
day
every
saturday
regularly
but
then
we
used
to
cover
up
our
furniture
with
when
we
went
to
the
seaside
and
furthermore
always
deposited
our
wills
in
the
bureau
under
the
same
adventurous
and
dangerous
circumstances
sealing
the
house
at
one
side
with
the
device
of
a
dove
bearing
an
in
its
mouth
so
that
we
might
be
quite
sure
profane
hands
had
not
meddled
with
our
house
or
our
possessions
during
our
absence
i
do
not
know
if
in
these
days
of
ours
and
of
competitive
examinations
and
rights
there
is
time
or
inclination
either
for
elaborate
games
such
as
we
used
to
play
over
the
but
i
hope
there
is
as
nothing
is
more
truly
engaging
than
such
a
possession
for
which
netting
new
curtains
and
making
new
furniture
even
occupied
the
boys
while
of
course
we
were
never
tired
of
altering
and
arranging
and
making
too
little
as
i
work
or
care
for
working
i
am
sure
i
should
enjoy
making
a
carpet
now
for
only
unfortunately
i
know
anyone
who
has
one
i
should
not
require
a
pattern
i
remember
the
black
diamonds
accurately
each
diamond
being
filled
with
a
different
coloured
wool
making
a
to
be
feared
indeed
in
these
Ã¦sthetic
days
of
ours
many
a
wet
afternoon
has
been
happily
passed
in
washing
and
our
net
curtains
for
the
windows
in
rearranging
them
and
tying
them
up
with
ribands
bought
at
when
it
was
one
wee
shop
served
by
the
universal
provider
himself
and
two
girls
for
which
we
saved
our
money
and
i
sincerely
believe
my
first
love
of
decoration
and
adornment
of
the
house
was
fostered
if
it
were
not
born
of
the
intense
attachment
i
had
for
my
at
the
desk
of
which
i
wrote
my
first
attempt
at
poetry
and
very
awful
it
was
and
to
whose
sheltering
care
i
confided
many
a
packet
of
which
i
was
always
going
to
submit
to
a
publisher
but
which
paucity
of
stamps
kept
safely
in
the
until
i
was
old
enough
to
know
what
utter
rubbish
i
had
written
and
how
worthily
it
would
have
been
rapidly
entombed
in
the
basket
below
the
illustrated
there
is
a
drawer
which
can
hold
any
amount
of
odds
and
ends
and
of
course
the
whole
side
of
the
room
could
be
if
cupboard
space
were
not
required
but
as
it
may
be
the
cupboard
is
shown
above
the
house
decorated
with
a
spray
of
flowers
painted
by
someone
who
knows
how
to
paint
not
by
any
amateur
dauber
for
you
must
never
allow
bad
art
in
your
nursery
even
if
you
know
it
will
have
to
be
done
away
with
in
a
comparatively
short
time
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
can
be
another
cupboard
this
should
be
treated
exactly
like
the
one
shown
of
course
without
the
this
will
give
ample
space
for
all
the
nursery
belongings
for
no
one
should
be
allowed
to
hoard
though
a
certain
amount
of
rubbish
should
always
be
winked
at
but
broken
toys
and
torn
books
should
be
mended
and
patched
capital
work
that
for
wet
days
and
should
always
be
sent
off
to
the
omnivorous
sisters
at
kilburn
who
can
use
anything
it
matter
what
and
who
will
welcome
as
treasures
what
the
children
will
no
longer
use
therefore
nothing
should
be
thrown
away
nurses
and
children
alike
all
enjoy
mending
and
making
for
the
kilburn
orphans
if
only
they
are
told
about
them
and
asked
to
take
an
interest
in
the
good
work
done
there
i
have
looked
about
all
over
london
i
think
since
writing
my
first
book
to
find
a
suitable
for
the
nursery
and
have
not
satisfied
myself
quite
that
i
have
done
it
i
can
not
like
or
in
any
way
advise
linoleum
there
it
is
cold
ugly
and
there
is
an
undeniable
odour
about
it
that
never
leaves
it
and
therefore
i
do
not
like
to
see
it
in
a
room
which
should
always
be
as
pretty
as
we
can
make
it
i
think
therefore
it
is
best
to
buy
a
square
carpet
with
either
a
border
or
else
a
good
woollen
fringe
round
and
put
this
down
over
carpet
felt
brussels
carpet
at
a
yard
would
wear
some
years
or
a
cheaper
carpet
still
might
be
had
in
the
lily
at
wide
width
but
i
should
prefer
the
brussels
for
really
hard
wear
the
staining
round
the
room
should
not
be
more
than
inches
wide
and
should
be
done
with
varnish
stains
when
the
stained
boards
begin
to
get
shabby
the
nursemaid
can
paint
them
over
herself
with
some
stain
and
they
can
be
kept
in
order
by
a
weekly
polish
from
the
stuff
sold
by
jackson
for
the
purpose
half
a
gallon
of
the
stain
is
sufficient
for
a
margin
round
a
room
this
would
cost
and
proper
directions
for
applying
the
stains
are
sent
out
with
them
personally
i
prefer
the
dark
oak
or
walnut
stain
to
any
of
the
others
there
should
never
be
a
in
any
room
but
i
must
again
state
this
in
connection
with
the
nursery
it
would
only
cause
accidents
and
would
serve
at
least
to
conceal
the
depredations
of
a
careless
nursemaid
who
can
not
refrain
from
making
that
portion
of
the
carpet
filthy
with
carelessness
when
she
is
doing
the
grate
if
she
should
be
provided
with
a
rug
with
which
to
cover
up
her
sins
the
carpet
can
be
turned
round
to
ensure
equal
wear
if
the
square
is
made
as
suggested
and
should
last
quite
ten
years
which
is
as
long
as
any
carpet
should
be
allowed
to
last
in
my
opinion
an
older
carpet
being
a
repository
of
dirt
and
dust
and
therefore
can
not
be
healthy
a
reason
why
i
should
never
advocate
very
expensive
carpets
as
i
much
prefer
to
be
able
to
have
a
new
one
without
too
much
exertion
on
my
part
especially
in
bedrooms
and
in
such
rooms
as
nurseries
and
schoolrooms
i
am
however
again
describing
a
nursery
and
this
instead
of
calmly
discussing
how
best
to
do
away
with
it
but
i
will
make
a
confession
here
and
then
i
fear
i
shall
show
how
bad
an
advocate
i
should
prove
were
i
called
in
to
advise
how
best
to
do
away
with
this
room
which
in
all
real
homes
is
the
very
heart
of
the
household
for
be
it
known
to
my
readers
that
as
my
youngest
child
was
eight
years
old
i
determined
to
do
away
with
the
nursery
and
converted
the
room
into
a
sitting
and
sleeping
room
for
my
nurse
who
was
henceforth
to
act
as
maid
the
young
person
who
was
as
her
own
baby
being
taken
from
her
and
sent
to
share
her
rooms
one
of
which
was
to
be
part
school
part
sitting
room
but
we
were
all
so
uncomfortable
i
had
no
heart
to
continue
the
arrangement
when
small
friends
came
to
tea
there
was
nowhere
for
them
to
go
wet
days
were
things
to
be
dreaded
because
the
child
had
no
real
place
of
her
own
for
her
things
and
after
struggling
on
for
nearly
a
year
we
have
returned
to
the
nursery
although
we
try
our
hardest
to
call
it
and
are
now
so
much
happier
in
consequence
another
problem
should
we
do
away
with
the
nursery
is
what
is
to
become
of
the
nurse
you
may
call
her
a
maid
and
give
her
your
garments
to
look
after
and
tell
her
she
must
now
take
on
her
the
work
of
a
maid
but
she
will
never
do
this
properly
she
will
miss
her
room
and
her
occupation
and
she
will
move
about
miserably
missing
the
children
and
yet
not
knowing
what
she
misses
and
will
neither
be
useful
nor
pleasant
but
leave
her
her
nursery
and
one
child
if
possible
and
she
will
be
quite
happy
and
much
as
we
may
hanker
after
a
maid
the
ideal
creature
who
shall
never
have
to
be
told
that
buttons
are
off
or
skirts
torn
who
shall
make
our
dresses
and
retrim
our
bonnets
we
owe
something
to
the
nurse
who
has
looked
after
the
children
at
the
worst
and
most
critical
time
of
their
lives
and
are
bound
if
we
can
not
afford
the
two
luxuries
to
sacrifice
the
maid
and
cling
to
the
nurse
and
be
quite
sure
if
we
do
we
shall
be
rewarded
the
children
may
be
grown
up
but
even
folks
have
colds
and
headaches
and
sometimes
worse
ailments
than
these
and
who
so
fit
to
keep
watch
over
these
ailments
as
the
nurse
who
has
gallantly
steered
us
through
measles
and
the
thousand
ailments
other
selfishness
is
always
handing
on
from
generation
to
generation
no
one
surely
and
if
she
and
the
nursery
are
retained
together
there
is
always
someone
who
knows
what
to
do
in
an
emergency
and
a
place
to
go
to
to
be
petted
and
quieted
and
made
much
of
as
only
a
nurse
can
do
who
has
had
her
nurslings
from
the
first
and
loves
them
as
only
their
mother
and
nurse
know
how
to
love
we
have
two
such
nurses
in
our
family
i
one
my
sister
the
other
and
i
can
never
advise
doing
away
with
any
nursery
when
i
remember
all
that
this
may
probably
mean
to
others
beside
the
householders
themselves
in
a
large
house
therefore
a
house
where
let
us
hope
people
mean
to
stay
some
years
this
is
an
extra
reason
for
making
the
nursery
as
pretty
as
possible
one
can
not
be
very
sentimental
over
a
schoolroom
there
is
always
a
suspicion
of
castle
about
that
room
and
it
can
invariably
be
turned
into
the
or
into
a
at
the
earliest
opportunity
but
all
the
sentiment
of
the
home
is
to
be
found
in
the
nursery
where
the
children
are
without
a
care
or
a
trouble
and
where
they
are
gaining
strength
and
health
for
the
battle
of
life
therefore
let
us
never
grudge
any
money
we
can
afford
being
spent
upon
the
nursery
as
i
said
before
i
always
consider
blue
by
far
the
pleasantest
colour
to
live
with
which
is
one
reason
why
i
advocate
blue
in
the
nursery
but
of
course
endless
combinations
of
colour
could
be
had
which
would
be
equally
pleasing
and
successful
but
not
as
nice
to
live
with
always
however
i
will
give
one
or
two
which
might
perhaps
be
liked
better
by
people
who
are
not
as
fully
convinced
as
i
am
on
the
merits
of
blue
a
pink
and
cream
nursery
would
be
pretty
and
bright
and
could
be
managed
by
using
cream
and
pink
paper
all
cream
paint
and
a
dado
the
dado
of
anaglypta
painted
cream
the
ceiling
paper
should
be
j
green
and
white
ceiling
at
the
carpet
should
be
either
the
green
or
or
from
wallace
and
the
cretonne
should
be
cretonne
at
the
muslin
curtains
being
if
possible
of
pink
and
green
muslin
an
expensive
muslin
but
a
very
lovely
one
which
would
complete
the
room
nicely
the
furniture
should
be
ash
and
as
simple
as
possible
and
the
flowers
on
the
cupboard
should
be
the
pink
flowering
rush
with
slender
reeds
and
a
few
pale
marguerites
yet
another
decoration
could
be
made
by
using
a
high
dado
of
arras
cloth
at
a
yard
this
would
be
sufficiently
high
to
allow
of
the
being
used
instead
of
a
above
this
the
paper
should
be
c
at
a
dull
paper
all
the
paint
should
be
the
ceiling
paper
should
be
yellow
and
white
the
curtains
yellow
cretonne
reversible
at
clear
indian
muslin
underneath
and
the
carpet
should
be
cottage
carpet
this
scheme
sounds
dull
but
were
anyone
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
condemned
to
use
a
sunless
room
as
a
nursery
she
would
find
this
arrangement
would
bring
the
sunshine
into
the
room
in
a
remarkable
manner
while
curtains
carpet
and
coverings
would
make
the
room
less
severe
and
be
equally
satisfactory
more
especially
if
hawthorne
muslin
in
yellow
and
white
were
placed
next
the
window
still
in
a
sunless
room
one
can
not
have
too
much
yellow
yellow
serge
would
be
found
useful
here
for
curtains
should
the
windows
be
large
or
a
draught
come
in
which
would
be
too
much
for
the
cretonne
to
keep
out
though
cretonne
should
always
be
lined
with
sateen
at
a
yard
and
for
a
nursery
should
be
edged
with
frills
the
is
really
too
tempting
for
small
children
who
can
not
resist
the
delights
of
pulling
off
the
little
tufts
wherever
they
are
within
reach
of
their
fingers
a
most
successful
decoration
if
rather
a
dainty
one
was
carried
out
under
my
directions
the
other
day
and
may
be
mentioned
here
as
variety
is
always
pleasing
to
some
minds
and
it
may
be
liked
by
those
who
approve
of
bright
colours
it
consisted
in
staining
all
the
woodwork
with
malachite
green
stain
and
papering
the
walls
with
admirable
red
and
cream
paper
the
ceiling
being
papered
with
a
pale
green
and
white
paper
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
green
drugget
from
barr
at
a
yard
wide
width
which
is
wearing
admirably
and
all
the
furniture
was
in
quaint
stained
wood
from
armitage
examples
of
which
are
illustrated
in
the
chapter
on
kitchens
the
settle
table
and
chairs
being
all
made
by
him
as
were
the
mantel
and
in
the
centre
of
this
latter
piece
of
furniture
was
placed
a
square
of
though
i
personally
should
have
preferred
a
good
autotype
in
the
red
tints
the
tiles
in
the
grate
were
red
and
there
was
the
orthodox
high
fender
with
brass
rails
which
should
never
be
wanting
in
any
room
where
there
are
children
the
and
curtains
were
of
green
serge
the
exact
shade
of
the
staining
and
the
room
altogether
was
far
prettier
than
i
had
expected
it
to
be
although
i
must
confess
my
expectations
were
very
high
out
of
one
of
these
schemes
of
decoration
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
all
are
possible
for
pither
among
others
will
always
keep
in
stock
any
paper
that
has
really
found
favour
with
the
public
therefore
i
am
not
recommending
what
will
be
out
of
power
to
possess
almost
before
these
words
are
in
type
as
was
the
case
a
very
few
years
ago
it
will
be
quite
easy
to
evolve
a
nursery
in
the
new
house
which
will
be
so
pretty
and
appealing
to
the
inhabitants
that
when
the
last
baby
is
a
tall
young
person
either
rejoicing
in
knickerbockers
or
a
frock
or
in
being
in
the
schoolroom
as
a
matter
of
course
and
who
goes
for
walks
and
has
meals
in
company
with
the
elders
and
we
are
forced
to
consider
the
problem
with
which
i
headed
this
chapter
we
may
reply
unanimously
no
not
as
long
as
nurse
lives
nor
as
long
as
there
is
the
very
smallest
chance
of
illness
or
of
our
having
to
entertain
small
visitors
for
these
even
the
cots
and
high
chairs
should
be
retained
they
do
not
eat
anything
as
one
of
our
old
nurses
used
to
say
when
i
wanted
to
give
away
some
of
the
treasures
and
they
may
even
come
in
for
the
grandchildren
who
will
appreciate
as
no
one
else
can
the
fact
that
they
are
having
just
what
their
parents
had
and
sitting
and
sleeping
in
the
very
beds
and
chairs
they
used
to
patronise
it
is
from
the
mistakes
of
others
we
learn
most
and
i
have
never
forgotten
the
lamentations
among
old
servants
at
home
when
the
nurseries
being
done
away
with
and
every
cot
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
my
mother
had
to
borrow
cots
and
turn
the
house
almost
upside
down
to
take
in
her
grandchildren
who
were
suddenly
sent
to
her
to
be
looked
after
during
a
sudden
stress
of
illness
an
inconvenience
that
caused
endless
worry
and
bustle
but
would
have
been
nothing
at
all
had
the
old
nurseries
still
been
as
they
were
and
which
as
a
rule
can
be
easily
managed
in
a
big
house
where
the
nurseries
have
been
properly
arranged
for
then
too
the
position
of
the
two
rooms
close
together
and
generally
a
little
way
removed
from
the
rest
of
the
house
though
not
at
the
top
i
beg
makes
them
a
most
admirable
place
for
an
invalid
to
retire
to
there
is
always
a
chance
of
illness
aye
even
serious
illness
as
one
gets
on
in
life
and
all
sorts
of
disagreeable
things
remind
one
that
one
is
not
immortal
and
though
as
a
rule
houses
are
built
emphatically
to
live
in
and
neither
to
be
ill
nor
die
in
though
despite
the
architects
both
these
unpleasant
matters
are
possible
one
can
generally
in
a
large
house
manage
that
the
nurseries
shall
be
close
together
and
quiet
therefore
they
should
be
kept
apart
for
our
own
use
we
could
be
ill
most
comfortably
in
the
night
nursery
and
convalescent
in
the
day
nursery
which
could
however
be
used
for
our
nurse
did
we
require
one
and
the
cheerful
pretty
papers
and
the
thoughts
that
would
be
inseparable
from
these
rooms
would
alike
help
us
to
bear
our
woes
while
we
could
have
nurse
to
talk
to
and
to
for
as
no
one
else
could
no
one
who
did
not
know
us
thoroughly
and
having
seen
us
in
sickness
and
in
health
in
adversity
and
prosperity
knows
exactly
what
we
can
bear
and
how
to
manage
us
best
thinking
over
everything
then
considering
carefully
what
the
nurseries
have
been
and
what
they
may
be
i
do
most
seriously
beg
all
my
contemporaries
to
pause
a
very
long
time
before
they
lay
a
ruthless
hand
on
what
was
once
as
sacred
as
a
shrine
no
amount
of
decoration
can
embellish
walls
decorated
with
the
hopes
and
joys
of
our
youth
and
first
playing
at
motherhood
no
other
paper
and
paint
give
us
the
idea
or
remind
us
as
do
the
old
papers
and
paint
of
a
thousand
and
one
things
no
one
can
possibly
want
to
forget
not
even
the
miseries
endured
during
serious
illness
the
anxieties
turned
into
joy
or
may
be
deepened
into
dreadful
gloom
by
death
itself
should
be
forgotten
aye
a
thousand
times
should
they
be
remembered
if
this
be
the
case
and
though
this
is
an
impatient
age
when
no
one
wants
to
think
and
when
death
is
treated
so
lightly
that
people
are
in
society
and
deepest
black
at
the
same
time
and
when
all
are
so
impatient
of
the
sorrow
death
brings
with
it
that
one
stays
at
home
except
the
corpse
i
trust
i
shall
not
number
many
of
them
among
my
readers
or
indeed
anyone
who
can
not
and
will
not
thankfully
remember
their
past
and
as
they
grow
old
darby
and
joan
together
will
not
spare
time
to
look
back
gladly
and
happily
to
days
which
were
better
perhaps
than
the
present
days
of
feeble
steps
and
darkened
lights
but
which
are
no
less
happy
if
edwin
and
angelina
are
still
hand
int
hand
and
heart
to
heart
and
have
proved
for
themselves
the
absolute
truth
that
where
marriage
is
begun
in
love
continued
in
love
and
ended
in
love
it
can
never
be
anything
save
success
and
that
anyone
who
calls
it
a
failure
must
know
absolutely
nothing
whatever
about
it
to
such
a
couple
as
this
the
nurseries
must
always
be
sacred
places
and
they
will
be
as
reluctant
as
i
am
to
do
away
with
them
i
think
therefore
i
may
take
it
for
granted
that
unless
absolutely
pressed
for
room
we
shall
retain
our
nurseries
keeping
them
fresh
and
bright
and
nice
in
case
we
are
ill
or
in
case
we
have
our
grandchildren
to
see
us
or
in
case
we
have
small
visitors
who
being
provided
with
suitable
rooms
are
nothing
but
a
pleasure
to
us
when
otherwise
they
might
be
nothing
except
a
trouble
and
a
nuisance
chapter
vi
the
room
in
writing
about
the
room
i
mean
to
consider
a
great
deal
more
than
decoration
though
naturally
that
will
not
be
neglected
for
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
as
years
go
by
that
something
definite
must
be
done
in
the
way
of
providing
for
the
women
who
flood
the
market
and
struggle
alas
that
it
should
be
so
in
the
open
streets
with
men
for
their
living
instead
of
contenting
themselves
with
being
the
helpmeets
of
those
with
whom
they
wage
this
unseemly
warfare
i
have
a
very
strong
opinion
that
people
should
not
bring
into
the
world
any
more
children
than
they
can
reasonably
hope
to
equip
in
some
measure
for
the
fight
boys
can
always
make
their
way
women
can
not
and
though
i
do
not
agree
with
besant
who
declares
that
women
hate
work
and
do
not
wish
ever
to
do
anything
i
do
think
that
no
woman
should
be
obliged
to
work
for
mere
food
and
clothes
at
all
events
in
the
ranks
above
the
lower
middle
classes
and
that
no
constitution
can
stand
the
anxiety
of
providing
her
own
sustenance
and
at
the
same
time
doing
work
to
procure
this
sustenance
for
anxiety
paralyses
a
woman
and
the
more
she
is
obliged
to
take
thought
for
the
morrow
the
less
able
is
she
to
ensure
the
being
provided
for
by
her
work
she
should
therefore
never
be
placed
in
a
position
in
which
she
is
literally
forced
out
into
public
strife
unless
from
her
very
earliest
days
she
has
been
brought
up
among
workers
and
taught
that
her
future
can
be
nothing
but
severe
toil
can
one
speak
too
strongly
of
the
wicked
selfishness
of
people
who
bring
ten
or
eleven
children
into
the
world
knowing
that
were
they
to
die
the
unhappy
creatures
would
either
starve
or
do
worse
than
starve
in
the
workhouse
or
in
one
of
those
excellent
and
institutions
where
the
child
becomes
a
unit
among
hundreds
of
uniformed
units
with
never
a
pretty
frock
or
sash
among
them
and
never
a
chance
of
anything
save
work
outside
the
walls
and
of
an
ultimate
grave
of
the
insensate
and
odious
conduct
of
those
parents
who
bring
up
their
children
to
have
every
single
thing
they
require
and
then
when
the
girls
do
not
marry
and
grow
old
at
home
leave
them
penniless
when
totally
unable
to
work
because
they
have
never
known
they
must
never
have
learned
a
single
thing
worth
knowing
and
that
they
must
either
starve
genteelly
or
live
on
their
overburdened
relations
or
add
to
the
already
fearful
number
of
people
who
paint
dreadful
little
tables
and
tambourines
sew
infamously
or
try
the
thousand
and
one
ways
of
making
a
little
money
which
cheapen
the
market
and
bring
institutions
for
the
sale
of
work
done
by
ladies
into
the
profoundest
contempt
i
say
that
the
state
should
interfere
and
force
a
man
to
lay
by
for
his
daughters
at
least
so
much
that
will
keep
them
from
such
an
end
or
to
give
them
such
an
education
that
at
any
moment
they
could
work
could
do
the
work
that
from
their
earliest
days
they
should
learn
is
waiting
for
them
in
the
near
future
and
that
if
a
own
sense
will
not
teach
him
that
he
has
no
right
to
make
helpless
women
suffer
as
women
must
suffer
who
find
themselves
destitute
in
middle
age
he
should
be
treated
like
a
criminal
and
punished
by
a
jury
which
should
be
composed
of
women
who
have
suffered
in
their
turn
through
their
selfishness
naturally
this
would
be
impossible
but
i
do
wish
consciences
could
be
awakened
and
every
successful
man
who
is
working
hard
spending
all
he
makes
and
adding
yearly
to
the
frocked
darlings
in
the
nursery
with
scarcely
an
would
remember
in
the
dead
of
the
night
when
sins
generally
find
one
out
that
the
day
of
reckoning
will
come
that
some
day
the
children
brought
up
in
luxury
and
accustomed
to
think
the
world
their
own
will
be
faded
spinsters
for
out
of
a
large
family
some
are
sure
to
remain
unmarried
in
these
days
and
that
all
the
sweetness
and
light
of
the
early
life
will
be
forgotten
and
the
father
will
be
cursed
when
these
faded
sorrowful
women
have
to
look
forward
to
nothing
but
patient
starvation
or
a
corner
grudged
to
them
by
their
more
successful
relations
to
whom
they
can
never
be
anything
save
incumbrances
for
these
disappointed
ones
of
the
earth
always
resent
prosperity
in
anyone
else
and
are
apt
to
snarl
and
snap
at
those
who
dole
them
out
the
bread
they
so
unwillingly
take
why
should
not
the
state
compel
every
working
man
with
two
or
more
daughters
after
two
the
case
should
be
legislated
for
to
pay
in
a
part
of
his
income
to
some
fund
for
providing
for
the
women
and
by
working
men
i
mean
those
who
have
no
capital
except
their
brains
the
artists
lawyers
clergymen
professional
men
of
all
kinds
who
have
nothing
but
themselves
to
depend
upon
the
man
making
and
spending
his
a
year
should
be
forced
to
put
by
at
least
a
year
for
the
poor
girls
who
come
into
the
world
without
their
own
consent
and
who
are
left
absolutely
destitute
save
of
a
certain
amount
of
distaste
for
anything
save
enjoyment
and
an
absolute
dislike
of
doing
anything
save
just
what
it
pleases
them
to
do
at
the
moment
while
at
the
same
time
a
properly
education
should
be
provided
that
will
enable
them
to
earn
something
in
addition
to
the
pittance
the
state
would
be
keeping
for
them
against
a
rainy
day
but
which
would
be
something
on
which
they
could
rely
with
certainty
and
which
would
allow
them
to
contemplate
possible
illness
without
the
deadly
sinking
that
fills
the
breast
of
any
woman
who
has
absolutely
nothing
but
her
own
self
to
rely
upon
and
who
knows
she
must
starve
or
seek
the
cold
comfort
of
the
corner
mentioned
before
if
she
can
not
continue
her
labour
i
can
not
put
the
case
too
strongly
before
the
fathers
and
mothers
who
may
read
this
book
for
after
all
they
must
be
their
own
state
and
do
their
own
legislating
they
must
not
have
enormous
families
that
they
can
not
feed
clothe
or
educate
respectably
and
they
must
so
manage
their
affairs
that
the
girls
can
rely
on
the
a
year
which
is
all
i
ask
for
all
that
is
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
a
single
woman
in
comfort
but
not
luxury
the
luxuries
must
be
earned
or
gone
without
they
must
do
this
i
say
unless
they
wish
to
look
down
from
whence
they
may
go
after
death
and
have
their
hearts
lacerated
and
torn
by
the
sight
of
the
women
they
have
left
to
starve
and
to
curse
those
who
have
entailed
so
much
misery
on
them
there
surely
would
be
some
insurance
company
who
would
undertake
to
do
for
all
what
the
edinburgh
life
assurance
company
king
william
street
does
for
schoolmistresses
who
like
to
pay
in
a
certain
amount
yearly
viz
pay
them
a
pension
at
a
certain
age
or
else
a
sum
of
money
whichever
they
prefer
and
the
parents
could
as
soon
as
they
added
another
daughter
to
the
household
begin
providing
for
her
if
they
can
not
do
this
i
maintain
they
are
absolutely
wicked
in
adding
that
little
life
to
the
overwhelming
population
already
here
there
is
no
misery
to
be
compared
to
the
misery
of
a
woman
who
never
having
imagined
her
future
can
be
aught
but
a
sheltered
one
finds
herself
at
middle
age
absolutely
destitute
and
at
the
mercy
of
her
relations
she
has
no
claim
on
anyone
but
her
parents
and
she
knows
this
and
suffers
infinitely
therefore
those
parents
must
contemplate
this
must
understand
that
marriage
does
not
come
to
the
lot
of
everyone
and
that
even
if
it
does
the
woman
should
not
go
penniless
to
her
husband
but
should
have
some
small
allowance
to
enable
her
to
feel
independent
and
to
add
to
her
house
or
her
pleasures
out
of
her
own
resources
here
again
i
mention
the
a
year
each
girl
in
an
upper
family
the
professional
family
can
not
possibly
cost
any
amount
less
than
that
in
the
case
of
course
of
some
would
be
amply
sufficient
and
this
sum
should
be
allowed
yearly
as
long
as
the
father
lived
after
which
insurance
money
should
be
forthcoming
that
would
insure
something
at
all
events
if
not
quite
as
much
as
they
have
been
having
if
however
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
a
man
to
give
his
daughters
anything
in
which
case
they
ought
most
distinctly
never
to
have
been
born
he
is
bound
to
tell
them
so
honestly
from
their
earliest
days
and
he
is
equally
bound
to
give
them
such
an
education
that
at
any
moment
they
can
earn
something
either
as
domestic
servants
and
for
my
part
i
would
and
far
rather
be
a
parlourmaid
than
a
nursery
governess
or
as
board
school
teachers
designers
or
as
members
of
such
of
the
home
branches
of
toil
as
are
open
to
women
who
can
not
aspire
to
the
higher
education
and
the
advantages
of
girton
and
similar
establishments
of
course
the
subject
of
work
is
one
on
which
volumes
have
been
written
and
volumes
might
still
be
compiled
from
the
same
source
and
i
could
not
naturally
go
into
all
the
and
of
each
occupation
in
this
chapter
even
if
i
knew
them
all
which
i
do
not
but
i
do
strongly
beg
my
readers
to
dissuade
their
girls
from
competing
with
the
men
they
only
lower
prices
and
finally
prevent
the
men
from
marrying
them
by
giving
themselves
one
less
chance
of
fulfilling
the
proper
end
of
their
sex
viz
to
make
a
home
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
there
is
plenty
for
women
to
do
without
scratching
and
fighting
with
the
men
if
only
they
can
realise
that
fact
i
shall
not
have
written
in
vain
i
have
had
lately
a
great
deal
to
do
with
women
who
have
to
earn
their
own
living
and
i
have
never
found
one
who
really
could
and
would
work
at
anything
that
turned
up
who
could
not
add
in
an
appreciable
manner
to
her
income
but
i
have
also
found
hundreds
who
would
not
even
try
to
do
what
i
could
offer
them
but
who
preferred
to
dabble
with
paint
to
embroider
hideous
cushions
no
one
wants
and
which
cost
pounds
to
make
to
undertaking
the
the
upholstery
and
above
all
the
dressmaking
and
cooking
with
which
any
sensible
woman
who
is
honest
and
can
keep
herself
and
manage
to
get
along
comfortably
no
if
they
get
just
the
work
they
want
they
will
not
take
any
or
if
they
take
it
they
grumble
return
it
at
the
time
they
promise
and
finally
are
so
unbusinesslike
that
their
employers
are
in
despair
and
vow
that
come
what
may
they
will
never
employ
a
lady
again
and
it
is
also
astonishing
to
me
how
the
mere
fact
of
being
gently
born
seems
to
these
poor
things
to
excuse
all
their
failings
rickety
screens
impossible
pictures
frightful
woollies
all
must
be
sold
at
a
higher
rate
for
them
than
for
anyone
else
because
they
are
made
by
ladies
and
so
it
should
be
if
ladies
understood
that
because
they
are
ladies
they
should
be
more
punctual
and
better
workers
than
the
poorer
classes
if
their
ladyhood
were
a
instead
of
a
screen
for
their
misdemeanours
but
they
will
not
see
this
and
in
consequence
they
bring
discredit
on
their
order
and
make
the
very
words
lady
synonymous
with
everything
that
is
bad
and
absolutely
unsaleable
to
be
a
successful
worker
one
must
take
the
work
which
comes
before
one
and
one
must
be
trained
to
work
to
punctuality
and
to
business
habits
therefore
if
there
be
one
of
the
families
of
daughters
no
other
nation
produces
in
the
reckless
way
our
own
does
it
is
imperative
that
the
training
to
work
begins
in
the
nursery
and
that
the
defenceless
girls
are
given
this
equipment
at
least
even
if
the
parents
can
do
no
more
for
them
the
boys
are
born
to
work
they
are
carefully
trained
and
brought
up
for
this
end
but
there
are
hundreds
of
cases
where
the
fathers
have
either
been
suddenly
ruined
or
become
poor
through
illness
or
their
own
selfishness
and
who
turn
the
girls
out
in
their
turn
and
are
much
astonished
when
the
poor
things
flounder
hopelessly
about
and
can
not
keep
themselves
because
they
have
had
absolutely
no
training
which
shall
fit
them
for
work
i
feel
in
writing
this
chapter
which
concerns
the
girls
of
the
household
that
i
can
not
say
too
much
about
the
subject
of
some
provision
being
made
for
them
and
that
they
should
be
relieved
not
only
from
the
necessity
of
having
to
find
a
market
for
unskilled
labour
but
also
from
the
trial
of
marrying
if
they
do
not
want
to
do
so
or
if
they
do
not
see
anyone
they
really
love
because
their
parents
are
continually
telling
them
it
is
their
duty
to
marry
in
order
to
make
room
for
their
younger
sisters
now
incredible
as
it
may
sound
to
male
ears
there
are
very
many
women
to
whom
marriage
and
the
obligations
and
responsibilities
entailed
thereby
are
absolutely
distasteful
and
disagreeable
as
a
rule
these
women
make
the
best
wives
and
but
they
are
not
the
happiest
people
in
the
world
and
would
probably
have
been
both
happier
and
better
had
they
followed
out
their
own
inclinations
and
lived
their
own
lives
in
their
own
way
without
the
constant
presence
of
a
man
and
the
unceasing
cares
of
a
household
on
their
shoulders
they
do
not
understand
love
with
a
big
l
and
passion
and
they
are
strangers
for
ever
and
always
would
be
but
they
marry
at
their
request
to
clear
out
the
nest
and
they
certainly
miss
the
higher
happiness
which
perchance
might
have
come
had
they
waited
either
from
their
work
or
from
meeting
the
one
individual
who
might
have
roused
their
sleeping
souls
and
shown
them
a
glimpse
of
the
paradise
that
exists
i
believe
for
those
lucky
natures
who
understand
what
we
may
call
the
aspect
of
the
case
albeit
i
also
think
they
use
up
rapidly
in
that
short
sojourn
in
paradise
which
serves
more
folk
for
the
whole
of
journey
for
myself
i
can
not
speak
i
am
a
prosaic
unsentimental
individual
and
so
far
have
got
on
without
sentiment
very
well
indeed
but
other
people
may
not
be
as
i
am
and
may
endure
misery
by
marrying
the
first
man
who
asks
them
because
they
see
plainly
how
desperately
they
are
grudged
the
room
in
the
house
which
should
have
been
theirs
for
ever
and
from
which
they
should
have
been
allowed
to
go
reluctantly
to
the
husband
who
appreciates
his
wife
a
thousandfold
if
he
understands
he
is
only
allowed
possession
on
sufferance
and
that
she
was
wanted
by
her
own
people
quite
as
badly
as
ever
he
could
want
her
himself
and
this
brings
me
round
to
the
question
of
giving
the
girls
their
own
room
in
the
house
where
they
can
do
just
what
they
please
and
where
they
can
ask
their
own
friends
to
tea
should
they
desire
to
do
so
not
however
in
the
american
way
which
empowers
the
young
people
to
have
festivals
whenever
they
like
and
to
ask
whom
they
like
to
them
but
in
a
mitigated
form
which
compels
them
to
ask
permission
to
entertain
and
furthermore
to
produce
a
list
of
names
so
that
full
knowledge
may
be
the
portion
and
that
she
may
know
exactly
who
is
coming
and
moreover
what
is
going
on
if
the
girls
have
their
own
they
feel
their
residence
under
the
paternal
roof
is
meant
to
last
as
long
as
the
roof
itself
and
they
have
not
that
hurried
disagreeable
feeling
some
unfortunate
girls
must
be
given
by
the
parents
who
make
no
provision
for
their
permanent
comfort
and
who
openly
speak
of
what
they
shall
do
when
gets
married
poor
who
has
never
had
an
offer
in
her
life
and
shrinks
away
from
every
man
she
sees
as
she
can
not
help
regarding
him
as
the
monster
who
carries
off
a
damsel
whether
she
wishes
it
or
not
because
the
fetish
of
home
has
to
be
appeased
and
the
fabric
kept
together
by
the
quick
sacrifice
of
those
who
are
old
enough
to
be
chained
to
the
rock
to
await
his
advances
the
home
of
the
making
and
the
decorating
the
management
and
the
keeping
together
of
which
i
feel
i
can
never
say
too
much
can
not
possibly
be
made
too
happy
too
pleasant
for
the
younger
members
of
it
but
they
in
their
turn
must
understand
that
they
too
have
their
part
in
the
whole
to
perform
the
daughter
in
such
a
home
is
a
most
precious
possession
she
can
save
her
mother
endless
trouble
she
can
and
does
take
the
burden
of
most
of
the
detail
on
her
shoulders
and
for
her
therefore
should
be
arranged
some
place
no
matter
how
small
that
she
can
call
her
own
and
where
she
can
in
some
measure
do
much
as
she
likes
for
she
is
sure
to
have
some
pet
occupation
friends
to
write
to
work
to
do
all
sorts
of
things
to
see
about
and
which
she
can
only
attend
to
in
a
room
set
apart
for
her
and
her
belongings
in
many
cases
the
schoolroom
makes
an
admirable
room
but
should
this
room
be
occupied
by
the
younger
children
when
the
elder
daughter
is
and
requires
a
room
to
herself
a
capital
arrangement
could
be
made
for
her
by
copying
the
french
fashion
of
a
an
arrangement
for
which
is
illustrated
here
and
which
my
artist
has
adapted
from
a
room
i
used
to
have
in
my
dorsetshire
house
where
space
was
a
great
object
and
where
the
downstairs
rooms
were
so
badly
managed
that
it
was
impossible
to
have
a
in
which
i
could
sit
although
there
were
two
tiny
rooms
beside
the
which
we
turned
into
bedrooms
and
which
constituted
our
only
spare
rooms
for
some
time
these
rooms
were
larger
than
need
be
bestowed
on
the
eldest
girl
of
a
house
and
were
made
by
removing
the
partition
between
a
the
bed
and
which
also
served
as
a
were
completely
screened
off
by
a
long
and
very
tall
japanese
screen
the
cabinet
which
stands
by
the
side
of
the
bed
held
a
quantity
of
linen
and
always
looked
very
decorative
and
not
in
the
least
like
the
humble
chest
of
drawers
that
it
undoubtedly
was
while
the
couch
in
the
first
window
served
as
a
sofa
and
furthermore
held
any
quantity
of
dresses
supplemented
as
it
was
by
the
cupboard
the
doors
of
which
are
panelled
with
japanese
leather
put
in
nearly
twenty
years
ago
and
verily
i
do
believe
the
very
first
doors
in
england
that
were
ever
treated
in
this
manner
i
never
saw
any
elsewhere
though
of
course
now
to
find
a
door
with
undecorated
panels
is
rather
an
impossibility
illustration
fig
at
all
events
in
any
house
the
owner
of
which
aspires
to
be
in
the
least
degree
artistic
the
room
illustrated
here
was
papered
with
a
very
soft
paper
and
had
a
dado
of
matting
and
a
hideous
shade
of
paint
in
those
days
one
could
not
find
a
ceiling
paper
anywhere
and
i
was
obliged
to
content
myself
with
a
species
of
wash
on
the
ceiling
which
much
exercised
the
mind
of
the
local
decorator
to
say
nothing
of
my
own
for
though
i
knew
i
hated
the
ordinary
whitewash
i
did
not
quite
know
how
to
set
about
a
change
but
notwithstanding
that
my
ceiling
was
rather
smeary
and
was
profoundly
jeered
at
by
the
good
local
housekeepers
to
whom
a
spotless
ceiling
and
a
clear
conscience
were
synonymous
and
to
whom
anything
new
or
strange
meant
undoubtedly
an
unsafe
spiritual
condition
the
relief
from
the
white
glare
of
the
ordinary
ceiling
was
so
great
that
i
stuck
to
it
manfully
and
even
added
a
blue
ceiling
to
one
of
the
other
rooms
until
i
came
across
a
pretty
paper
and
had
that
put
up
to
the
intense
disgust
of
the
builder
and
the
open
horror
of
the
inhabitants
who
since
my
day
have
papered
their
ceilings
too
and
done
all
sorts
of
other
things
which
i
used
to
preach
in
my
but
of
which
they
took
no
heed
until
they
saw
me
in
print
then
they
were
quite
sure
i
was
right
and
began
to
alter
their
houses
and
make
them
prettier
than
they
had
ever
been
before
i
should
not
now
put
and
brown
together
but
that
room
somehow
always
looked
very
harmonious
the
short
frilled
curtains
were
of
a
charming
soft
and
white
cretonne
which
unfortunately
has
been
out
of
stock
for
something
like
fourteen
years
the
muslin
was
a
very
soft
madras
with
frills
also
and
the
couch
was
covered
in
the
same
patterned
cretonne
only
in
blue
and
white
when
the
paper
became
shabby
and
a
little
dull
i
added
a
frieze
of
japanese
fans
all
round
and
they
gave
just
the
colour
i
required
to
the
room
one
can
not
somehow
buy
such
good
fans
nowadays
as
those
were
unfortunately
and
this
is
not
imagination
for
i
possess
a
good
many
of
these
identical
ones
now
and
i
can
never
find
in
any
of
the
numerous
japanese
shops
which
have
succeeded
liberty
hewitt
or
i
should
say
followed
them
any
paper
fans
that
are
half
such
good
colours
or
such
pretty
designs
as
those
which
formed
the
frieze
in
that
particular
room
i
had
the
floor
covered
entirely
with
matting
and
rugs
were
placed
about
the
whole
of
the
furniture
with
the
exception
of
the
shown
in
window
no
was
wickerwork
and
as
in
those
days
there
was
no
aspinall
i
had
to
beg
my
varnished
paint
from
the
man
who
mended
our
carriages
and
who
could
never
produce
anything
except
a
very
good
black
and
a
particularly
awful
blue
which
i
only
tried
once
and
eschewed
in
favour
of
black
which
remained
on
for
years
and
finally
succumbed
to
the
superior
charms
of
blue
and
other
delicate
and
pleasant
colours
the
shelves
both
in
the
recesses
by
the
fireplace
and
between
the
windows
will
give
an
excellent
idea
how
to
manage
these
dwarf
bookcases
which
hold
a
quantity
of
books
while
the
tops
serve
as
cabinets
or
stands
for
china
the
corners
of
the
room
had
a
series
of
long
wooden
brackets
in
each
edged
with
frills
of
velveteen
and
the
had
on
a
painted
board
for
the
shelf
edged
with
a
deep
frill
or
flounce
also
of
the
same
velveteen
a
narrow
strip
of
was
placed
along
at
the
back
as
overmantels
were
not
invented
and
i
had
always
a
horror
of
the
great
glass
sheets
then
in
vogue
while
above
that
hung
pictures
fans
which
made
a
species
of
overmantel
arrangement
for
myself
with
which
i
was
quite
satisfied
the
room
altogether
always
looked
pretty
and
nice
and
was
much
admired
it
was
always
full
of
ferns
and
palms
and
flowers
too
without
which
no
room
can
ever
look
well
spend
what
one
may
on
the
furniture
and
decorations
thereof
this
species
of
is
always
a
capital
possession
and
were
space
no
object
in
a
house
i
should
always
arrange
the
in
a
similar
manner
there
should
be
a
and
to
each
where
all
the
dressing
operations
could
be
carried
on
and
the
bath
should
be
shut
off
by
double
doors
from
the
passage
such
an
arrangement
is
quite
delightful
both
for
visitors
and
when
one
has
to
remain
in
room
from
for
once
up
and
on
the
sofa
the
whole
appearance
of
a
bedroom
vanishes
when
the
screen
is
in
place
which
is
put
straight
along
between
the
bed
and
the
cabinet
all
the
housework
is
done
behind
the
screen
the
housemaids
entering
by
the
curtained
door
and
the
invalid
is
not
worried
by
the
sight
of
operations
while
her
room
always
looks
nice
and
she
can
receive
there
anyone
she
may
care
to
see
which
she
could
not
do
were
the
room
frankly
a
and
nothing
else
of
course
on
ordinary
days
the
windows
must
be
opened
as
soon
as
dressing
is
over
and
left
open
for
a
good
two
spell
of
airing
and
the
room
should
not
be
sat
in
after
tea
or
after
luncheon
if
possible
this
gives
ample
time
for
a
due
course
of
airing
the
only
objection
anyone
could
make
to
this
arrangement
being
that
probably
the
room
might
be
stuffy
or
the
air
in
it
exhausted
by
being
used
during
the
day
as
well
as
slept
in
during
the
night
this
objection
vanishes
into
thin
air
when
the
windows
are
opened
widely
and
kept
open
from
about
two
till
bedtime
indeed
i
say
after
bedtime
for
whatever
the
weather
may
be
i
have
one
window
open
all
night
and
whenever
possible
every
window
which
will
open
remains
so
indeed
one
window
in
our
present
house
has
not
been
closed
for
a
moment
during
three
years
now
in
decorating
a
room
on
a
smaller
scale
for
a
girl
her
own
individual
taste
should
be
in
some
measure
consulted
but
nothing
can
possibly
be
or
look
better
than
the
delightful
paper
sold
by
haines
at
the
piece
it
is
a
paper
of
which
one
never
tires
and
has
also
the
capital
quality
of
being
no
distinct
colour
and
of
allowing
any
colour
being
used
in
the
room
with
it
while
at
the
same
time
should
a
distinct
hue
be
desired
a
room
decorated
with
the
paper
can
be
made
distinctly
blue
or
according
to
the
manner
in
which
the
room
is
painted
or
according
to
the
frieze
or
dado
selected
for
example
the
paper
could
be
hung
above
a
dado
of
cretonne
sold
by
shoolbred
at
a
yard
which
almost
matches
the
paper
the
paint
in
this
case
being
ivory
and
the
ceiling
paper
land
in
yellow
and
white
at
the
piece
the
curtains
could
be
either
of
the
same
cretonne
or
of
a
louis
xvi
brocade
sold
by
colbourne
at
a
yard
double
width
the
floor
could
be
covered
with
matting
and
there
should
be
some
rugs
about
on
the
floor
thus
making
one
decoration
without
any
distinct
colour
another
could
be
the
with
a
plain
green
frieze
or
a
frieze
of
haines
paper
at
a
piece
this
is
run
round
the
room
not
put
on
in
strips
like
and
therefore
would
not
be
as
expensive
as
it
sounds
the
and
all
the
woodwork
could
be
stained
green
with
malachite
green
stain
the
ceiling
paper
could
be
pink
and
white
the
carpet
green
and
the
chairs
could
be
stained
green
and
upholstered
either
in
the
pinky
louis
xvi
brocade
of
which
the
curtains
could
be
made
or
else
of
the
cretonne
mentioned
above
the
bed
should
be
covered
with
a
worked
quilt
a
good
occupation
for
any
girl
would
it
be
to
make
such
quilts
while
the
towels
and
should
all
bear
embroidered
monograms
being
a
positive
badge
of
disgrace
in
a
household
where
there
should
be
useful
fingers
there
are
a
great
many
floral
papers
such
as
the
at
sold
by
giles
the
sold
by
maple
and
the
rose
sold
by
haines
which
are
all
charming
for
such
rooms
or
indeed
for
any
room
but
should
a
severer
form
of
decoration
be
required
my
readers
can
not
go
wrong
with
any
of
papers
or
of
new
damasque
papers
which
are
all
as
good
and
artistic
as
they
can
be
and
which
can
be
used
fearlessly
by
anyone
who
is
not
sure
enough
of
his
own
taste
to
allow
himself
to
select
a
paper
on
his
own
account
or
has
not
time
and
patience
to
encounter
the
invariable
battle
with
the
decorator
who
will
not
produce
until
he
is
absolutely
obliged
any
paper
on
which
he
can
not
see
his
way
to
making
an
exorbitant
profit
and
who
sets
forth
paper
after
paper
trusting
to
his
own
ingenuity
and
his
powers
of
wearying
his
victim
to
enable
him
to
sell
some
venerable
which
has
long
vexed
his
soul
by
its
unremunerative
existence
on
some
back
shelf
i
am
delighted
myself
with
damasque
papers
which
have
only
been
brought
out
since
i
wrote
my
first
book
and
which
therefore
have
not
had
the
honourable
mention
there
that
they
so
very
richly
deserve
to
have
had
the
blue
and
silver
damasque
at
being
a
perfect
paper
and
one
that
would
be
quite
satisfactory
in
a
unless
it
happened
to
be
a
very
small
one
in
that
case
the
blue
and
silver
marigold
at
would
do
equally
well
with
these
papers
a
dado
is
imperative
as
i
do
not
consider
they
have
sufficient
substance
in
them
to
withstand
the
wear
and
tear
inseparable
from
their
position
at
the
base
of
the
wall
a
dado
of
thin
matting
or
of
a
good
japanese
paper
would
look
well
with
the
matting
the
paint
should
be
ivory
with
the
leather
paper
a
good
red
paint
should
be
selected
which
will
harmonise
with
the
blue
in
any
case
a
red
carpet
such
as
dull
red
carpet
or
dull
red
should
be
selected
and
the
curtains
should
be
the
same
red
in
serge
or
else
in
a
dull
blue
cretonne
the
made
on
purpose
to
harmonise
with
this
paper
by
oetzmann
the
planning
and
talking
over
the
arrangement
of
this
room
will
be
a
great
amusement
both
to
mother
and
daughter
and
i
strongly
recommend
the
mother
to
attempt
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
surprise
but
to
frankly
take
her
daughter
into
her
confidence
and
consult
her
tastes
on
the
subject
if
she
wishes
the
room
to
be
a
real
success
i
am
compelled
to
recommend
this
course
from
an
experience
of
my
own
because
i
have
never
forgotten
my
unconcealable
dismay
at
returning
home
after
a
long
visit
to
find
my
own
mother
had
planned
such
a
surprise
for
me
but
had
in
all
innocence
and
with
such
kindness
done
such
dreadful
things
to
my
pet
belongings
that
i
often
recall
the
remembrance
of
my
start
of
horror
and
exclamation
of
dismay
with
the
profoundest
contrition
for
i
did
not
know
then
what
i
have
only
realised
in
after
years
that
i
must
have
pained
her
dreadfully
for
dear
soul
she
had
done
all
the
renovations
out
of
her
own
savings
and
had
taken
much
trouble
and
pains
about
it
and
i
could
not
help
saying
why
did
you
let
them
do
this
before
i
realised
that
this
was
a
surprise
and
i
ought
to
have
been
enchanted
instead
of
dismayed
at
her
renovations
renovations
that
were
in
absolute
good
taste
for
her
taste
was
perfect
and
her
house
charming
long
before
anyone
else
cared
for
their
house
but
which
somehow
were
not
my
ideas
and
which
annoyed
me
dreadfully
because
the
arrangements
were
not
mine
at
all
and
which
i
never
dared
alter
afterwards
because
i
had
already
received
the
changes
so
ungraciously
instead
of
realising
that
i
should
have
been
enchanted
with
the
forethought
and
goodness
which
had
prepared
all
this
for
me
remembering
my
own
reception
of
a
similar
surprise
therefore
advise
that
the
daughter
should
be
consulted
in
every
way
about
the
room
she
is
to
inhabit
unless
of
course
she
has
no
tastes
of
her
own
and
does
not
care
what
the
room
looks
like
so
long
as
she
has
it
to
herself
then
the
room
can
be
made
as
pretty
as
the
mother
likes
but
there
are
few
girls
nowadays
who
do
not
care
for
their
rooms
and
are
not
as
eager
as
anyone
else
to
make
themselves
a
pretty
nest
that
they
may
regard
as
their
own
and
not
as
a
perch
on
which
they
rest
on
sufferance
until
they
are
pushed
out
by
the
juniors
into
the
arms
of
the
first
man
who
appears
in
the
least
degree
anxious
to
have
her
for
a
wife
i
do
hope
that
whatever
else
happens
the
daughters
of
the
household
may
never
be
sent
away
to
schools
or
urged
at
a
high
school
to
overwork
their
brains
and
go
in
for
those
wretched
competitive
examinations
i
am
no
advocate
for
the
higher
education
of
women
for
votes
for
women
for
anything
which
shall
take
them
out
of
the
sheltered
home
atmosphere
where
women
alone
can
breathe
comfortably
and
live
properly
and
force
them
into
the
arena
of
life
and
i
do
hope
mothers
who
may
read
this
book
will
consider
what
they
are
doing
when
they
force
their
girls
forward
and
delight
in
the
hard
work
and
successful
examinations
which
ruin
their
constitutions
and
make
them
irritable
and
nervous
and
old
before
their
time
i
know
only
too
well
that
there
are
women
who
are
compelled
to
work
but
i
shall
always
maintain
this
should
not
be
and
to
return
once
more
to
the
subject
with
which
i
began
my
chapter
i
state
boldly
that
neither
would
they
be
were
the
families
of
english
people
smaller
and
were
we
less
extravagant
less
determined
to
snatch
all
we
can
from
life
doing
absolutely
nothing
for
ourselves
that
we
can
get
someone
else
to
do
for
us
why
i
know
myself
one
family
of
five
or
six
daughters
who
if
their
father
died
would
not
have
a
year
yet
who
go
out
night
after
night
to
balls
who
take
cabs
at
every
moment
never
saving
a
shilling
who
are
waited
upon
by
half
a
dozen
servants
and
yet
who
ought
to
do
the
housework
themselves
who
ought
to
be
content
with
a
quarter
of
the
gaiety
they
insist
upon
the
poor
silly
things
even
went
to
court
though
heaven
knows
the
queen
would
have
sent
them
back
again
had
she
known
what
their
dresses
cost
a
price
moreover
that
would
never
be
paid
and
who
finally
would
have
far
more
chance
of
happy
marriage
than
they
have
now
when
every
man
they
know
looks
askance
at
their
garments
and
then
at
their
worried
face
and
avoids
them
justly
declining
to
put
themselves
in
the
noose
which
is
round
his
neck
and
which
will
surely
kill
him
even
if
he
can
keep
his
head
above
water
for
much
longer
this
case
is
the
case
of
hundreds
of
families
at
present
and
therefore
i
feel
i
can
not
say
too
much
about
it
and
i
do
hope
mothers
will
therefore
think
a
little
more
about
their
daughters
and
endeavour
to
restore
a
little
of
the
quiet
and
simplicity
which
are
almost
extinct
in
this
rushing
era
of
ours
and
which
can
never
be
found
among
those
who
are
cast
out
from
the
shelter
of
home
and
forced
into
competition
a
competition
that
is
as
odious
as
it
is
unnecessary
in
most
lives
and
that
would
be
altogether
unnecessary
were
there
fewer
girls
in
the
world
and
were
we
content
to
spend
one
quarter
of
the
money
we
do
on
all
sorts
of
nonsense
and
on
extra
servants
who
only
make
our
daughters
lazy
and
luxurious
when
they
ought
undoubtedly
to
be
up
and
doing
the
moment
a
girl
leaves
the
control
of
the
schoolroom
and
the
watchful
eye
of
the
governess
she
should
be
told
that
though
now
she
is
to
some
extent
her
own
mistress
she
must
not
consider
her
education
finished
but
rather
that
the
real
part
of
education
is
just
beginning
and
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
every
day
should
begin
with
some
steady
work
and
it
is
also
well
that
some
definite
rule
should
be
made
on
this
subject
certain
small
household
duties
should
be
given
to
her
and
certain
studies
should
be
continued
leaving
it
to
her
to
select
in
some
measure
what
those
studies
shall
be
now
in
the
richest
households
there
are
many
things
which
should
never
be
left
to
servants
if
one
wishes
the
house
to
look
like
the
abode
of
a
lady
and
not
of
a
one
the
principal
one
in
my
eyes
being
the
arrangement
of
the
flowers
the
best
gardener
in
the
world
has
only
a
ideas
and
can
not
know
what
to
bring
in
and
how
to
place
what
he
brings
in
in
an
absolutely
satisfactory
way
and
as
dead
flowers
and
fading
plants
are
disgraceful
and
worse
than
an
utter
absence
of
floral
decoration
the
first
duty
a
girl
should
undertake
is
that
of
going
round
the
rooms
the
moment
breakfast
is
over
to
decide
which
plants
are
to
be
removed
and
which
vases
should
be
refilled
in
the
country
the
gardener
should
wait
her
orders
and
have
the
flowers
gathered
dry
and
before
the
heat
of
the
sun
is
on
them
and
should
himself
exchange
the
plants
the
position
of
them
being
determined
by
his
mistress
as
the
arrangement
of
the
flowers
should
be
left
to
her
alone
if
done
systematically
in
the
manner
here
indicated
all
the
house
will
look
fresh
and
nice
and
there
would
be
no
chance
of
overwork
to
arrange
the
flowers
an
old
dress
should
be
worn
also
a
large
apron
and
sleeves
should
be
donned
despite
the
fact
that
the
gardener
should
bring
in
the
flowers
there
is
always
something
extra
to
gather
at
the
last
moment
and
one
rushes
out
gets
skirts
covered
with
damp
mould
and
dew
from
the
grass
or
shakes
down
a
quart
or
so
of
water
from
the
trees
all
over
one
and
a
dress
is
spoiled
in
a
moment
a
serious
matter
at
all
times
but
something
more
than
serious
when
one
has
forestalled
allowance
and
afford
another
garment
anyhow
the
arrangement
of
the
flowers
in
most
houses
nowadays
would
occupy
at
least
an
hour
after
which
the
girl
should
sit
down
for
a
steady
read
at
some
standard
work
carefully
chosen
for
her
or
else
to
any
sewing
work
she
may
care
for
then
she
should
take
up
her
hobby
and
i
trust
she
may
have
one
for
her
own
sake
and
she
should
either
practise
paint
or
write
or
do
anything
she
likes
save
read
novels
until
the
hour
before
luncheon
when
she
go
out
if
she
be
wise
she
will
continue
her
regular
walk
with
the
schoolroom
party
if
not
she
must
be
sent
out
to
see
her
friends
do
about
the
village
or
town
or
else
arrange
for
a
game
at
tennis
anything
to
ensure
some
exercise
the
girls
of
the
present
day
care
for
walks
for
sake
but
they
must
have
exercise
somehow
whether
they
care
for
it
or
not
in
london
i
maintain
any
girl
who
knows
how
to
behave
and
who
is
told
plainly
how
to
conduct
herself
can
safely
go
about
the
streets
alone
from
the
day
she
is
eighteen
i
have
done
so
ever
since
i
can
remember
and
though
i
do
not
consider
myself
lovely
i
certainly
was
please
i
am
not
conceited
and
i
never
met
with
any
adventure
of
the
very
smallest
kind
and
given
a
straightforward
walk
an
air
of
having
something
to
do
and
doing
it
no
peeping
into
for
example
and
not
a
suspicion
of
loitering
anywhere
i
maintain
any
ordinary
girl
can
go
about
alone
perfectly
should
it
be
inconvenient
to
send
someone
with
her
or
should
she
have
no
girl
friend
or
sister
with
whom
to
walk
anyhow
london
is
much
safer
than
the
country
with
its
crawling
tramps
and
its
suspicious
cows
at
every
corner
to
say
nothing
of
mad
bulls
and
dogs
and
all
kinds
of
perilous
adventures
the
morning
walk
disposed
of
after
luncheon
then
could
come
any
pleasures
there
are
sure
to
be
calls
to
be
made
tennis
to
go
to
afternoon
parties
concerts
and
all
kinds
of
small
dissipations
then
would
come
dinner
after
which
if
there
were
no
going
out
amusing
books
could
be
allowed
and
in
fact
any
amusement
that
she
particularly
cares
for
should
now
be
indulged
in
the
evenings
should
be
entirely
her
own
and
if
she
has
any
hobbies
and
wishes
to
continue
the
work
let
her
do
so
you
will
very
likely
be
as
glad
to
be
left
alone
for
a
little
with
your
husband
as
she
is
anxious
to
return
to
her
own
quarters
and
resume
the
special
employments
on
which
she
was
engaged
i
am
now
writing
about
those
lucky
girls
who
have
an
assured
future
of
some
kind
who
though
they
may
not
be
rich
should
their
father
die
will
not
have
to
join
in
the
fearful
battle
for
bread
and
who
should
represent
the
sex
universally
had
i
my
way
and
therefore
i
do
not
dwell
on
the
necessity
for
toil
that
would
be
inevitable
were
the
parents
aware
of
the
sword
hanging
over
their
heads
in
this
case
the
girls
should
know
the
truth
and
should
themselves
elect
whether
they
should
prepare
armour
against
the
fray
or
hang
about
hoping
against
hope
that
they
may
be
married
before
the
evil
days
that
must
come
fall
upon
the
household
but
girls
who
are
pretty
well
off
and
who
as
i
said
before
can
not
starve
if
their
parents
die
should
still
endeavour
to
find
some
real
occupation
for
themselves
they
may
never
want
to
make
much
money
by
it
but
they
should
always
be
able
to
save
money
by
it
and
if
they
can
not
do
anything
definite
or
that
will
be
likely
to
be
heard
of
in
the
world
they
should
cultivate
their
fingers
and
should
learn
to
embroider
and
sew
in
order
that
their
room
at
first
and
their
houses
afterwards
should
be
made
beautiful
by
them
and
should
show
evidences
of
their
industry
and
the
excellent
uses
they
have
made
of
their
time
make
the
room
pretty
and
the
girls
will
like
to
sit
there
and
spend
their
time
carefully
within
the
charming
walls
but
do
not
for
one
moment
tolerate
laziness
lounging
or
and
as
long
as
the
girls
are
at
home
see
that
the
mornings
at
all
events
are
properly
employed
the
results
of
the
day
should
be
seen
should
be
inspected
and
the
masters
or
mistresses
who
should
still
attend
to
continue
some
lessons
german
music
and
painting
being
the
best
i
think
should
be
interviewed
now
and
again
about
the
progress
of
the
pupil
and
a
watchful
but
not
inquisitorial
eye
should
be
kept
on
all
that
goes
on
in
the
room
else
we
shall
find
it
turned
into
a
or
a
spot
where
all
is
play
and
nothing
useful
is
ever
done
lessons
in
dressmaking
and
in
cooking
should
be
given
if
possible
to
every
girl
and
she
should
also
at
the
earliest
age
possible
be
taught
to
knit
socks
and
stockings
and
above
all
she
should
in
the
very
fullest
sense
of
the
word
learn
her
duty
to
her
neighbours
and
be
taught
that
her
superior
advantages
both
of
time
and
money
should
be
tithed
for
those
whose
lives
lack
so
much
and
could
be
made
so
very
much
brighter
were
we
all
to
do
our
duty
by
them
i
am
not
an
advocate
for
slumming
i
do
not
consider
any
girl
should
have
a
district
and
unless
in
the
country
teaching
is
not
always
to
be
attempted
but
some
part
of
the
day
should
be
set
aside
either
for
working
for
the
poor
amply
represented
to
me
by
the
sisters
at
the
kilburn
orphanage
or
in
making
some
life
brighter
in
the
country
it
is
easy
to
collect
flowers
for
hospitals
or
to
ask
dwellers
in
courts
to
tea
in
the
garden
in
london
to
make
things
which
will
be
useful
and
to
take
girls
and
boys
occasionally
to
some
museum
or
picture
gallery
just
for
an
change
from
the
crowded
streets
i
think
girls
should
always
do
one
thing
during
the
day
as
a
matter
of
custom
for
the
poor
but
whatever
is
done
should
be
done
under
some
direction
young
folks
are
enthusiastic
and
hurried
and
often
do
more
harm
than
good
by
indiscriminate
charity
but
then
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
can
sometimes
be
consulted
and
when
he
can
not
i
say
send
to
kilburn
to
the
orphanage
in
randolph
gardens
there
without
consideration
of
creed
with
large
and
vigorous
minds
and
hearts
all
are
helped
and
all
work
can
be
used
all
help
received
with
the
perfect
assurance
that
what
we
send
there
will
emphatically
reach
those
for
whom
it
is
meant
and
that
there
are
no
highly
paid
secretaries
to
come
before
the
poor
and
suffering
these
are
all
large
matters
to
be
discussed
in
this
book
but
i
can
not
think
they
are
out
of
place
i
am
thankful
to
say
that
far
more
people
trouble
themselves
now
about
their
poorer
neighbours
than
in
bygone
days
that
rich
men
realise
that
they
are
only
stewards
of
their
property
and
that
they
should
administer
their
goods
for
the
poor
as
well
as
for
themselves
that
while
the
owner
of
a
large
park
and
magnificent
pictures
is
not
bound
to
cut
up
the
former
for
or
distribute
the
latter
among
the
denizens
of
whitechapel
he
is
bound
to
allow
them
to
see
both
under
proper
control
whenever
he
is
called
upon
to
do
so
that
for
the
poor
are
far
more
necessary
than
for
the
rich
and
that
all
who
regard
life
rightfully
and
have
had
a
large
share
of
best
things
are
bound
by
their
duty
to
god
and
their
neighbour
to
administer
them
in
some
measure
for
the
poor
who
will
gradually
become
more
fit
to
share
them
as
we
show
them
our
possessions
and
teach
them
how
to
regard
them
properly
under
these
circumstances
there
is
great
hope
that
our
girls
may
advance
farther
than
we
have
done
and
being
most
carefully
trained
from
their
earliest
days
to
remember
poor
may
do
so
as
a
matter
of
course
and
may
consider
that
day
wasted
indeed
which
can
not
show
at
least
one
thing
done
to
alleviate
some
of
the
misery
and
poverty
there
is
in
this
overcrowded
world
of
ours
the
weaker
sex
indeed
we
may
be
weak
physically
we
are
we
allow
that
we
allow
that
our
impulsiveness
our
weakness
our
very
structure
forbids
us
battling
with
the
men
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
that
dreadful
scrimmage
for
life
in
which
some
women
would
cast
us
all
and
all
we
beg
is
to
be
allowed
to
confess
that
and
have
some
shelter
provided
for
us
where
we
can
do
our
part
of
the
work
our
part
that
a
weak
mind
can
not
undertake
but
that
is
essentially
the
part
the
part
of
beautifier
of
the
home
and
administrator
of
the
finances
and
through
the
home
of
the
outside
world
too
where
we
see
all
men
as
our
brothers
and
sisters
and
where
we
recognise
our
place
as
helpers
not
rivals
of
consolers
not
competitors
of
the
men
who
should
do
the
sheltering
and
that
no
woman
except
under
most
exceptional
circumstances
can
possibly
manage
by
herself
alone
therefore
if
all
who
have
girls
remember
this
and
instil
in
their
hearts
the
fact
that
we
want
them
at
home
that
even
if
they
should
not
marry
or
become
senior
wranglers
or
anything
else
equally
prominent
and
unpleasant
their
lives
can
be
busy
and
useful
and
fully
occupied
and
of
infinite
use
in
their
generation
we
shall
do
something
for
the
world
at
large
even
if
we
let
all
this
grow
only
out
of
the
innocent
preparation
of
the
room
when
they
have
reached
the
end
of
the
first
stage
of
their
life
and
become
in
some
measure
mistresses
of
themselves
but
for
fear
i
may
be
considered
too
solemn
and
serious
and
for
fear
that
my
readers
may
think
i
am
adverse
to
gaiety
and
would
not
let
girls
enjoy
themselves
under
any
circumstances
whatever
i
will
finish
this
chapter
and
pass
on
to
consider
far
more
frivolous
things
namely
how
to
manage
dress
allowance
and
furthermore
how
best
to
arrange
for
any
festivities
we
may
be
able
to
afford
when
we
have
maidens
in
the
household
who
are
anxious
to
chapter
vii
and
dress
i
always
regard
the
expression
as
rather
a
ridiculous
one
when
used
by
the
ordinary
upper
household
yet
as
it
has
become
a
recognised
part
of
our
vocabulary
i
suppose
we
must
all
adopt
it
when
we
talk
of
that
enchanting
period
of
a
life
which
occurs
when
she
is
about
eighteen
and
is
in
some
measure
emancipated
from
the
control
and
care
which
have
been
her
portion
from
the
day
she
was
born
until
the
joyful
moment
arrives
when
the
books
may
be
closed
and
the
shut
and
she
takes
her
place
among
her
elders
as
a
right
and
not
on
sufferance
any
more
here
i
should
like
to
pause
for
a
moment
to
impress
upon
all
mothers
who
may
read
my
book
that
a
girl
should
remain
absolutely
in
the
schoolroom
until
she
reaches
her
eighteenth
birthday
the
longer
she
can
be
kept
from
the
turmoil
of
life
from
the
shams
and
wearinesses
of
ordinary
society
and
from
any
temptations
to
shirk
her
education
the
better
she
will
not
be
pleased
with
her
mother
at
the
time
she
will
think
regretfully
and
may
be
angrily
of
those
of
her
less
guarded
more
friends
who
are
over
the
at
seventeen
who
never
read
an
instructive
book
or
think
of
anything
save
dress
admirers
and
what
dissipation
is
in
store
for
them
next
but
when
she
looks
back
at
her
girlhood
from
the
altitude
of
that
calm
sheltered
i
wish
for
all
girls
for
whom
i
care
she
will
see
what
she
has
to
thank
her
mother
for
and
all
the
disagreeable
feelings
she
had
then
towards
her
will
be
atoned
for
a
thousandfold
in
the
flood
of
grateful
affection
which
will
fill
her
heart
and
in
the
love
which
she
will
entertain
for
one
who
trained
her
so
carefully
and
who
cared
for
no
present
lack
of
affection
because
she
knew
quite
well
she
would
infallibly
and
at
no
very
late
date
reap
her
reward
the
years
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
are
undoubtedly
the
years
during
which
a
girl
learns
most
and
in
a
properly
guarded
household
she
would
then
comprehend
more
fully
than
at
any
other
time
how
necessary
it
is
to
use
every
moment
for
the
best
she
would
form
habits
of
study
regularity
and
appreciation
of
what
is
best
in
art
and
literature
which
she
would
never
lose
and
which
would
only
develop
as
years
went
on
and
she
would
furthermore
lay
in
a
stock
of
health
on
which
she
could
draw
at
will
when
the
real
stress
of
living
begins
and
she
finds
herself
in
her
turn
with
a
heavy
burden
of
real
work
on
her
shoulders
and
has
a
house
to
manage
a
husband
to
please
and
children
to
bring
forth
and
care
for
unceasingly
and
this
latter
is
the
strongest
argument
i
can
use
against
girls
being
too
young
if
they
are
they
may
marry
i
knew
one
parent
criminal
enough
to
allow
a
child
of
sixteen
to
take
upon
herself
this
burden
and
should
they
marry
and
have
children
they
entail
on
themselves
and
on
unborn
generations
misery
compared
with
which
a
life
spent
always
in
the
schoolroom
would
be
a
life
of
elysian
and
purest
delight
the
first
thing
to
consider
with
our
girls
is
their
health
let
that
stand
before
every
single
thing
dress
them
as
little
mites
carefully
and
warmly
as
young
girls
insist
on
warm
clothing
and
perpetually
dry
feet
and
skirts
never
allow
a
game
of
tennis
on
a
damp
lawn
to
pass
by
without
seeing
that
no
damage
is
done
thereby
and
then
furthermore
insist
on
early
bed
until
the
is
over
allow
no
dances
of
any
kind
forbid
entirely
the
parties
which
are
at
the
root
of
half
the
epidemics
the
affectations
and
the
bad
manners
of
the
present
day
while
you
take
care
that
pleasant
companionship
treats
in
the
shape
of
afternoon
concerts
or
plays
or
with
children
their
own
age
these
give
the
necessary
relaxation
and
you
can
face
the
gaieties
with
a
light
heart
knowing
quite
well
that
your
daughter
has
the
necessary
physique
to
stand
the
strain
and
that
she
has
arrived
at
a
age
and
will
be
able
to
know
when
she
has
had
enough
pleasure
the
while
she
will
care
herself
for
something
beside
balls
and
parties
albeit
she
will
in
no
measure
despise
a
proper
allowance
of
both
i
am
no
puritan
i
do
not
object
to
dancing
or
theatres
or
any
other
amusement
but
i
do
plead
for
moderation
in
all
things
and
that
a
girl
may
have
time
for
something
beside
mere
play
i
ask
it
not
only
because
their
mental
health
must
suffer
but
because
their
physique
can
not
possibly
stand
that
present
strain
and
yet
remain
intact
ready
to
bear
the
yet
greater
strain
to
which
most
women
are
exposed
during
their
married
life
i
know
only
too
well
what
an
uncontrolled
girlhood
and
unending
gaieties
did
for
me
and
i
am
only
again
writing
out
of
my
own
experience
in
the
hope
that
i
may
save
some
few
girls
from
the
misery
in
store
for
them
if
they
begin
their
fashionable
life
before
they
are
eighteen
and
if
when
they
begin
it
they
have
no
moderation
about
it
and
go
from
ball
to
ball
party
to
party
until
their
faces
become
thin
and
wretched
their
bloom
goes
their
tempers
and
noses
sharpen
together
and
they
are
unstrung
and
miserable
just
at
the
time
when
life
demands
most
from
them
and
they
ought
to
be
as
well
and
happy
as
they
are
miserable
nervous
and
broken
in
spirits
and
in
health
i
actually
have
known
one
mother
introduce
her
daughter
at
seventeen
because
the
next
daughter
was
far
prettier
and
she
wished
to
give
no
before
no
appeared
on
the
scene
can
anything
be
more
ignoble
than
that
and
it
is
to
save
both
mothers
and
daughters
from
a
similar
fate
to
that
which
will
overtake
this
couple
that
i
am
pleading
for
the
girls
that
in
fact
they
may
be
saved
from
themselves
by
the
prompt
action
of
those
who
ought
to
be
the
first
to
shield
their
children
from
a
too
early
contact
with
the
world
i
should
myself
keep
a
girl
to
regular
hours
until
she
was
eighteen
but
even
after
that
as
i
have
shown
in
my
last
chapter
she
should
have
employment
and
occupation
until
she
was
eighteen
she
should
never
be
in
bed
later
than
and
she
should
always
be
down
at
while
she
ought
never
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
any
large
dance
before
then
small
ones
ending
at
should
be
very
sparsely
attended
and
those
not
at
all
until
she
was
past
seventeen
when
the
auspicious
date
of
her
eighteenth
birthday
draws
near
a
great
effort
should
be
made
to
celebrate
it
properly
on
that
date
a
girl
comes
into
her
kingdom
accepts
at
your
hands
the
sceptre
of
and
the
crown
of
an
educated
and
girlhood
and
certainly
some
special
notice
should
be
taken
of
such
an
occasion
not
please
by
her
being
presented
at
court
the
rush
of
the
wives
of
wine
merchants
successful
upholsterers
and
tradesmen
of
all
kinds
has
made
what
was
once
a
stately
and
beautiful
ceremony
a
mockery
indeed
of
course
girls
whose
parents
are
about
the
court
who
have
long
pedigrees
and
ancient
titles
are
bound
to
be
introduced
to
the
head
of
society
and
to
take
their
places
round
the
throne
but
just
think
for
a
moment
what
it
means
to
the
ordinary
family
the
frightful
expense
the
worry
and
strain
of
the
presentation
the
fatigue
and
showing
off
at
the
room
afterwards
and
finally
the
dead
and
unpleasant
certainty
that
they
will
never
be
asked
to
one
court
function
that
they
are
no
nearer
being
the
bosom
friend
of
the
princesses
than
they
were
before
and
that
their
social
status
has
not
been
improved
in
the
least
indeed
it
has
gone
down
for
old
friends
sneer
at
the
foolishness
and
scoff
when
they
see
the
name
in
the
paper
remembering
with
redoubled
force
the
counters
of
the
wine
merchant
and
shopkeeper
which
would
have
been
entirely
forgotten
had
not
the
light
which
beats
upon
the
been
reflected
on
those
who
approach
it
and
shown
up
the
flaws
in
the
pedigree
which
were
on
the
way
to
oblivion
but
which
give
ample
scope
for
scoffing
from
the
very
lips
which
are
drinking
the
tea
at
the
after
the
drawing
room
where
all
are
wondering
what
the
dresses
cost
and
whether
jones
or
smith
as
the
case
may
be
will
last
over
the
season
or
whether
he
will
marry
off
his
daughters
before
the
crash
comes
and
all
go
under
together
remember
i
am
not
scoffing
at
trade
it
would
ill
become
me
to
do
so
but
i
am
simply
asking
my
readers
to
be
sensible
and
to
be
frankly
and
absolutely
themselves
personally
i
would
far
rather
pin
my
rights
to
being
a
lady
on
the
fact
that
art
and
literature
have
been
my
sponsors
than
on
being
the
of
a
mistress
or
a
ruffianly
robber
of
other
goods
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
a
waiter
on
courts
should
have
business
at
those
courts
therefore
i
say
that
those
who
can
not
consider
themselves
owing
the
queen
a
call
and
the
courtesy
of
showing
her
their
girls
as
they
grow
up
to
take
their
places
either
as
friends
or
servants
have
any
right
to
go
there
and
that
they
had
much
better
stay
at
home
and
not
make
themselves
ridiculous
by
an
attempt
to
be
and
seem
what
they
can
never
really
be
let
us
suppose
that
our
eloquence
has
prevailed
and
that
the
girl
has
reached
her
eighteenth
birthday
and
there
is
no
talk
of
her
being
presented
or
any
such
nonsense
but
still
something
must
be
done
to
celebrate
the
auspicious
event
if
the
birthday
is
in
autumn
or
winter
or
very
early
spring
there
is
no
reason
why
a
dance
should
not
be
indulged
in
more
especially
if
it
can
be
afforded
or
if
there
is
room
for
such
dissipation
these
two
things
are
of
course
to
be
considered
before
anything
else
a
ball
can
cost
any
sum
anyone
likes
to
spend
on
it
all
depends
on
the
purse
and
the
ideas
if
we
engage
a
good
hall
and
band
go
in
for
a
regular
and
supper
any
amount
of
flowers
and
so
on
i
tremble
to
think
what
the
bills
may
come
to
but
all
can
be
ascertained
by
writing
to
the
different
places
where
such
things
are
to
be
found
gunter
will
give
an
estimate
per
head
for
the
supper
the
hall
secretary
will
tell
you
the
charges
per
night
green
of
crawford
street
will
tell
you
what
her
fee
for
decorating
the
room
would
be
and
mitchell
of
bond
street
would
provide
the
band
but
people
who
can
afford
to
arrange
matters
grand
are
not
likely
to
come
to
me
for
advice
if
they
did
i
should
only
hand
them
over
to
the
authorities
still
if
these
lucky
folk
should
come
across
my
book
this
will
tell
them
what
to
do
but
ordinary
folk
can
give
a
very
enjoyable
dance
for
a
little
over
to
about
people
making
the
hours
from
eight
to
twelve
and
having
a
supper
at
about
a
head
ending
up
with
soup
just
before
the
guests
start
for
home
and
i
fancy
that
if
one
had
a
sufficiently
large
house
and
could
manage
the
supper
oneself
it
could
be
done
for
very
much
less
particularly
if
one
has
a
supper
which
is
really
all
that
can
be
required
when
people
have
dined
late
and
only
want
something
to
carry
them
over
the
later
hours
and
the
extra
amount
of
fatigue
to
make
such
a
dance
a
success
the
floor
must
be
perfect
a
band
of
from
three
to
five
performers
engaged
and
people
must
be
thoroughly
well
introduced
to
each
other
and
if
possible
no
girl
must
be
seen
sitting
out
without
a
valiant
struggle
on
the
part
of
the
hostess
to
prevent
such
a
sad
occurrence
by
finding
her
a
partner
i
can
not
countenance
or
believe
in
dances
or
in
fact
any
social
gathering
where
there
are
no
introductions
it
is
simply
an
excuse
for
laziness
on
the
part
of
the
hostess
which
all
too
often
condemns
her
guests
to
a
great
deal
of
misery
and
dulness
of
course
the
theory
is
a
perfectly
correct
one
the
practice
however
can
not
in
my
opinion
be
too
heartily
condemned
there
will
always
be
and
shy
girls
who
know
very
few
people
and
these
can
not
possibly
dance
unless
we
see
they
know
men
to
dance
with
is
there
any
misery
like
the
misery
of
a
girl
who
is
dying
to
dance
who
loves
the
exercise
for
its
own
sake
and
who
has
to
sit
out
on
a
bench
her
feet
impatiently
tapping
the
floor
and
her
little
heart
ready
to
break
with
disappointment
while
she
sees
married
women
who
ought
to
know
better
and
who
ought
never
to
dance
at
all
as
long
as
a
girl
is
sitting
out
prancing
all
about
the
place
and
caring
nothing
for
the
poor
young
things
whose
day
it
is
as
long
as
they
enjoy
themselves
that
is
quite
enough
for
them
the
watchful
hostess
will
have
none
of
these
engaging
little
ways
at
her
dances
the
girls
are
provided
for
first
the
matrons
after
and
as
this
would
be
impossible
were
introductions
done
away
with
i
would
impress
upon
my
readers
to
cling
to
this
old
fashion
and
to
see
that
the
girls
enjoy
themselves
no
matter
who
else
do
not
except
as
chaperons
married
women
are
out
of
place
in
the
ballroom
and
should
not
be
encouraged
to
come
there
if
they
do
their
duty
by
their
homes
their
husbands
and
their
children
they
could
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
for
such
a
pursuit
when
my
own
daughter
the
other
day
we
had
about
people
to
a
dance
in
watford
and
it
cost
us
just
under
because
our
house
was
too
small
to
have
any
festivity
in
we
had
to
engage
rooms
which
cost
about
the
supper
cost
about
at
a
head
including
soup
aÃ«rated
waters
and
waiters
and
a
certain
amount
of
decoration
for
the
approach
anterooms
we
had
plenty
of
moss
plants
which
our
own
gardener
arranged
the
local
band
of
three
performers
cost
and
the
rest
went
for
wine
programmes
and
odds
and
ends
generally
the
dance
was
certainly
most
successful
and
went
off
very
well
and
was
quite
as
much
as
we
could
afford
naturally
i
should
have
preferred
much
grander
doings
a
supper
the
band
or
any
other
excellent
one
but
it
would
have
been
foolish
to
refuse
to
entertain
at
all
because
we
could
not
manage
these
gorgeous
details
details
that
were
as
much
above
our
means
as
they
would
have
been
quite
unnecessary
in
watford
but
the
dance
was
successful
because
the
girls
were
pretty
and
the
men
pleasant
because
old
friends
came
down
and
rallied
round
us
and
because
we
all
saw
the
girls
did
not
sit
down
once
that
there
was
no
flagging
and
that
all
who
could
be
introduced
were
made
to
know
each
other
i
dare
say
there
were
plenty
of
people
who
wondered
they
did
not
have
a
gorgeous
supper
but
i
do
not
care
if
they
did
and
i
certainly
am
never
going
to
precipitate
myself
head
first
into
the
bankruptcy
court
because
someone
else
gives
what
no
doubt
they
can
well
afford
to
do
but
which
i
could
not
and
which
were
i
to
do
i
should
soon
come
utterly
to
an
end
i
mention
all
these
personal
details
to
show
that
what
we
did
can
be
done
by
other
people
certainly
by
people
who
have
a
big
house
and
plenty
of
servants
at
a
moderate
cost
and
i
hope
i
shall
not
have
become
a
of
because
of
all
i
have
said
but
as
i
always
think
personal
experience
frankly
given
is
worth
any
amount
of
polite
theory
i
give
my
experience
here
as
elsewhere
hoping
that
it
may
be
of
use
to
many
beside
myself
if
the
damsel
is
born
in
the
summer
i
strongly
advise
a
though
alas
in
this
climate
we
are
so
dependent
upon
the
weather
that
i
mention
this
with
a
certain
amount
of
diffidence
but
given
one
of
the
lovely
june
days
nature
sometimes
kindly
dowers
us
with
and
can
anything
on
earth
be
pleasanter
than
one
of
these
gatherings
may
be
if
properly
managed
the
garden
is
looking
its
best
and
if
the
seats
are
judiciously
arranged
and
a
proper
amount
of
amusement
legislated
for
the
hostess
can
greet
her
friends
with
a
light
heart
she
can
be
quite
sure
of
a
successful
party
without
too
much
trouble
or
expense
on
her
part
the
refreshments
should
be
either
in
a
tent
on
the
lawn
or
else
in
any
room
that
may
open
out
into
the
garden
should
there
be
no
such
room
i
strongly
advise
the
tent
to
be
procured
one
can
always
be
borrowed
at
a
most
reasonable
expense
as
if
the
refreshments
are
not
easily
accessible
the
party
becomes
scattered
the
timid
do
not
like
to
separate
themselves
and
go
in
search
of
sustenance
while
the
greedy
can
seclude
themselves
and
snatch
an
undue
share
of
the
good
things
prepared
for
the
entire
company
given
the
tent
or
the
room
and
we
can
proceed
to
place
very
long
and
narrow
tables
there
which
we
should
decorate
with
as
many
flowers
as
we
possibly
can
get
together
and
should
we
have
very
many
londoners
coming
to
our
gathering
we
should
put
a
host
of
the
little
baskets
whiteley
sells
for
about
a
set
under
the
tables
and
fill
them
at
parting
with
what
we
garnished
the
tables
with
roses
and
lilies
and
greenery
are
not
to
be
despised
in
london
and
our
friends
will
come
down
to
us
cheerfully
another
year
if
they
carry
away
a
souvenir
of
our
last
gathering
people
mind
carrying
flowers
and
we
can
always
spare
those
we
have
used
for
garnishing
the
table
among
the
flowers
we
should
put
large
imari
bowls
of
strawberries
and
cream
ready
for
ladling
out
on
small
dishes
the
strawberries
should
be
denuded
of
their
hulls
and
the
whipped
cream
which
can
be
thickened
with
white
of
egg
and
made
palatable
with
sugar
should
be
piled
high
on
the
fruit
which
of
course
should
be
unbroken
if
a
refrigerator
is
handy
the
prepared
fruit
should
be
kept
there
until
the
last
moment
and
only
produced
when
the
guests
have
begun
to
assemble
the
places
for
the
bowls
being
kept
by
plates
to
prevent
the
symmetry
of
the
table
being
spoiled
by
a
careless
or
hurried
i
strongly
advise
all
the
cakes
being
bought
from
buszard
who
will
moreover
tell
you
honestly
the
amount
of
the
different
kinds
you
should
have
for
the
number
you
expect
and
as
a
rule
you
should
prepare
for
a
few
more
folks
than
you
have
down
on
your
list
if
a
very
fine
day
people
often
bring
friends
with
them
i
personally
like
them
to
do
this
and
if
you
yourself
happen
to
know
anyone
who
possesses
little
girls
and
who
is
coming
herself
i
advise
you
to
ask
her
to
bring
the
children
children
are
delightful
additions
to
a
they
look
like
bright
butterflies
flitting
about
and
should
therefore
be
encouraged
to
come
not
by
a
written
invitation
which
would
make
them
unduly
prominent
and
of
consequence
in
their
own
eyes
but
by
a
casual
mention
which
can
not
inflate
them
and
yet
will
show
they
have
been
thought
about
by
us
beside
the
fruit
and
cakes
a
little
finely
cut
and
rolled
brown
bread
and
butter
should
be
prepared
but
only
a
little
few
people
eat
it
as
a
rule
it
spoils
their
gloves
and
they
do
not
want
it
and
it
is
wasted
if
left
and
if
the
weather
is
really
summerlike
and
hot
ices
should
be
provided
and
also
iced
lemonade
gingerbeer
and
no
other
wine
is
requisite
and
as
wine
is
frightfully
dear
and
should
never
be
given
unless
really
good
i
advise
it
being
omitted
altogether
unless
expense
is
no
object
when
the
can
be
from
to
the
garden
could
be
illuminated
with
coloured
lamps
and
a
cold
supper
succeed
the
tea
this
of
course
is
the
ideal
but
one
which
is
out
of
the
reach
of
most
people
who
have
a
great
many
friends
and
want
to
see
them
without
an
undue
and
enormous
expense
the
of
course
should
be
swept
and
garnished
and
newly
marked
out
for
the
occasion
and
several
enthusiasts
over
this
to
me
idiotic
game
should
be
told
off
to
see
that
all
who
want
to
play
can
do
so
if
this
is
not
done
we
shall
be
vexed
by
seeing
this
game
which
is
so
dear
to
so
many
quite
left
alone
and
i
defy
any
hostess
to
attend
to
her
guests
and
keep
the
rolling
at
the
same
time
she
must
engage
the
help
of
her
younger
guests
and
to
them
must
be
left
the
everlasting
trouble
of
making
up
the
sets
which
seem
to
me
to
have
only
just
begun
as
they
are
finished
now
in
the
dear
departed
days
of
croquet
a
hostess
had
nothing
to
do
but
make
up
the
sets
of
eight
and
set
them
going
she
saw
nothing
more
of
her
guests
a
set
of
eight
lasting
quite
as
long
as
the
itself
could
be
expected
to
do
anyhow
there
must
be
something
beside
tennis
to
amuse
our
guests
and
i
think
a
band
is
almost
a
necessity
particularly
if
one
is
blessed
with
a
decent
local
band
then
the
expense
will
not
be
ruinous
one
can
get
an
excellent
string
band
from
town
for
about
i
particularly
like
orchestra
all
particulars
of
which
can
be
had
from
the
secretary
or
from
chappell
new
bond
street
but
sometimes
it
is
as
well
to
encourage
local
talent
if
one
can
do
so
without
fatal
effects
when
for
you
can
have
a
good
deal
of
music
always
a
cheerful
matter
and
can
sometimes
have
very
good
music
too
but
a
local
band
should
always
be
put
a
good
way
off
distance
as
a
rule
lending
an
immense
amount
of
enchantment
to
their
productions
i
think
also
that
some
of
the
charming
scenes
from
shakespeare
can
be
given
with
great
effect
i
also
am
very
fond
of
glees
and
some
recitations
are
often
amusing
but
should
these
latter
be
indulged
in
let
me
beg
that
the
hostess
knows
beforehand
something
about
them
else
will
her
fate
be
what
mine
was
once
when
an
enthusiast
began
a
long
long
long
poem
i
know
to
this
day
what
it
was
whether
it
was
meant
to
be
pathetic
or
comic
or
not
but
i
do
know
my
agonies
were
awful
and
that
i
was
rapidly
going
mad
when
an
opportune
shower
put
a
stop
to
the
eloquence
which
had
gone
on
unceasingly
through
the
passing
of
several
express
trains
all
of
which
made
a
hideous
noise
and
any
one
of
which
would
have
been
sufficient
to
daunt
any
other
individual
short
amusing
really
amusing
recitations
are
always
a
success
and
i
should
taboo
anything
tragic
or
sentimental
or
anything
which
lasted
over
ten
minutes
at
the
outside
never
however
be
persuaded
to
give
a
trusting
to
tennis
alone
there
can
be
nothing
more
dreary
than
such
an
entertainment
it
is
like
an
where
nothing
but
talk
is
provided
i
would
never
heap
on
amusements
out
of
doors
or
have
music
without
stopping
in
doors
but
i
should
always
provide
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
serves
as
a
pleasant
reason
for
the
gathering
an
with
music
can
never
be
a
success
if
the
seats
are
put
in
rows
and
people
are
forced
to
sit
stiffly
close
together
an
outdoor
one
can
never
pass
off
well
unless
we
prepare
amusements
and
see
that
our
guests
are
really
entertained
and
yet
not
overburdened
with
our
attentions
i
think
a
whole
chapter
might
be
written
on
the
art
of
being
a
hostess
and
yet
perhaps
a
few
words
may
suffice
i
believe
a
hostess
like
a
poet
is
born
not
made
still
a
few
hints
may
not
be
out
of
place
for
i
think
sometimes
parties
are
unsuccessful
because
though
possessed
of
the
best
intentions
the
hostess
may
lack
the
knowledge
that
alone
can
ensure
a
successful
entertainment
in
the
first
place
without
emulating
two
friends
of
mine
one
of
whom
took
the
youngest
unmarried
girl
in
the
room
down
to
dinner
while
the
other
out
of
pure
kindness
let
his
wife
walk
in
first
and
then
followed
himself
and
in
consequence
was
hugely
laughed
at
i
do
think
that
in
ordinary
society
a
great
deal
of
ridiculous
fuss
is
made
about
precedence
what
can
it
matter
to
the
wife
of
some
man
knighted
but
the
other
day
whether
she
or
the
wife
of
the
parson
goes
into
or
out
of
the
room
first
if
it
does
she
must
be
so
stupid
that
i
should
not
care
to
see
her
in
my
house
while
to
me
it
does
matter
immensely
whether
i
have
someone
to
take
me
in
who
knows
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
and
reads
his
newspaper
and
sees
every
play
that
comes
out
give
me
a
man
like
that
and
i
in
the
least
care
what
his
father
was
neither
should
i
care
one
bit
whether
jones
and
smith
and
smith
and
brown
walked
in
or
out
of
the
room
before
me
they
may
all
go
if
they
like
in
a
string
so
long
as
i
have
a
pleasant
companion
and
a
pretty
table
to
look
at
and
a
dinner
i
care
in
the
least
how
i
reach
the
see
that
the
people
who
are
likely
to
get
on
have
an
opportunity
of
knowing
each
other
watch
that
no
one
is
sitting
glum
and
disconsolate
in
a
corner
remember
if
you
can
who
is
anxious
to
be
introduced
to
or
shown
any
celebrities
in
the
world
of
art
and
letters
who
may
happen
to
be
present
and
above
all
consider
pleasure
before
you
think
of
your
own
and
in
a
large
gathering
never
sit
down
until
you
are
actually
driven
to
do
so
through
fatigue
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
the
party
will
be
a
success
and
send
out
your
invitations
remembering
that
the
pleasantest
people
are
not
always
those
who
can
afford
to
ask
you
again
and
that
your
object
in
entertaining
is
above
all
to
give
pleasure
to
see
clever
and
entertaining
people
in
your
house
and
not
to
ensure
a
return
as
soon
as
may
be
for
what
you
are
doing
i
do
not
care
if
people
are
the
highest
in
the
land
if
they
are
dull
i
would
far
rather
meet
and
know
people
who
are
clever
and
interesting
than
the
most
exalted
member
of
the
peerage
i
could
number
among
my
acquaintances
if
she
were
stupid
and
uninteresting
and
had
nothing
to
recommend
her
but
her
coronet
and
her
connection
with
what
jeames
de
la
pluche
calls
the
i
think
that
i
have
now
given
some
idea
how
to
ensure
success
at
the
two
kinds
of
parties
which
might
be
used
as
means
of
introducing
a
daughter
to
the
world
at
large
but
of
course
there
are
a
great
many
other
gatherings
which
may
be
indulged
in
and
above
all
let
us
learn
always
to
be
ready
to
give
a
welcome
to
any
of
the
friends
should
we
discover
that
they
are
not
nice
we
can
easily
speak
about
it
and
tell
our
reasons
for
not
receiving
them
but
young
people
will
only
make
nice
friends
and
we
must
invariably
be
ready
to
give
them
a
cheerful
welcome
we
can
always
be
glad
to
see
them
after
dinner
or
to
afternoon
tea
this
can
not
ruin
us
and
when
possible
we
should
let
them
stay
in
the
house
and
encourage
them
all
we
can
at
the
same
time
the
rules
of
the
house
must
be
kept
the
hours
for
meals
and
the
general
habits
of
the
elders
respected
and
we
must
not
be
expected
to
help
in
the
entertaining
that
must
be
left
entirely
to
the
younger
members
of
the
household
whose
friends
they
are
perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
problems
after
we
have
settled
on
our
manner
of
entertainment
is
to
determine
how
the
girls
shall
dress
and
in
what
manner
they
shall
manage
their
dress
allowance
this
should
be
made
to
them
and
paid
punctually
from
their
eighteenth
birthday
but
it
should
never
be
made
without
starting
a
girl
with
a
good
and
sufficient
wardrobe
with
a
miniature
trousseau
in
fact
if
this
is
not
done
unless
of
course
the
allowance
is
a
very
handsome
one
the
girl
will
get
hopelessly
into
debt
and
will
never
be
free
from
that
millstone
all
her
life
dress
is
unfortunately
so
frightfully
expensive
nowadays
that
the
problem
of
how
to
dress
at
all
always
a
serious
one
has
assumed
gigantic
proportions
of
late
years
we
went
out
immensely
in
our
youth
and
had
a
year
allowed
us
which
we
just
scraped
through
on
although
i
remember
how
anxiously
i
watched
the
sleeves
of
one
special
grenadine
dress
which
i
could
not
have
afforded
to
replace
anyhow
and
which
would
wear
out
in
the
most
agonising
way
and
which
was
one
mass
of
darns
before
i
could
get
another
and
i
have
never
forgotten
the
anxiety
it
gave
me
to
say
nothing
of
which
really
seemed
to
vanish
perceptibly
bit
by
bit
after
each
visit
to
the
laundress
but
nowadays
girls
can
not
go
out
very
much
and
appear
well
dressed
on
double
that
sum
even
with
a
year
there
would
have
to
be
cutting
and
contriving
and
a
good
would
be
an
imperative
necessity
should
there
be
really
very
many
balls
every
year
and
afternoon
and
evening
dresses
to
be
seen
after
besides
of
course
if
not
more
than
can
be
spared
to
each
girl
the
attendance
at
balls
must
be
limited
and
a
great
deal
of
sewing
must
be
done
by
the
damsel
herself
but
i
never
recommend
anyone
to
go
to
a
cheap
or
common
dressmaker
if
she
does
her
garments
will
never
look
nice
and
she
will
spend
three
times
as
much
as
she
need
on
renovations
and
alterations
while
she
will
run
every
imaginable
risk
of
having
her
stuff
spoiled
and
the
dress
made
so
badly
that
she
can
not
wear
it
supposing
the
girl
is
to
begin
with
her
allowance
of
her
trousseau
should
consist
of
a
dozen
of
each
necessary
she
should
have
six
pairs
of
silk
six
of
fine
cashmere
and
six
of
warmer
cashmere
hose
she
should
have
four
white
skirts
a
silk
underskirt
and
a
quilted
poplin
skirt
she
should
have
two
morning
dresses
one
a
good
one
with
a
jacket
to
match
the
other
cashmere
she
should
have
two
best
dresses
one
for
every
evening
one
for
dances
and
two
for
balls
and
she
should
have
a
sealskin
coat
a
waterproof
and
a
jacket
and
about
three
hats
she
should
have
four
pairs
of
boots
and
four
pairs
of
shoes
and
she
should
remember
that
the
longer
these
are
kept
in
stock
before
they
are
worn
the
better
and
one
pair
of
shoes
should
never
be
taken
into
regular
wear
without
another
being
purchased
to
take
its
place
cheap
shoes
and
boots
should
never
be
bought
under
any
pretext
whatever
they
wear
out
at
once
are
a
hideous
shape
always
and
are
dangerously
thin
things
which
should
prevent
their
being
in
any
wardrobe
i
am
often
struck
particularly
in
crowds
or
in
large
gatherings
at
the
perfectly
frightful
clothes
most
english
women
wear
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
fact
is
caused
by
the
extraordinary
fondness
they
seem
to
have
for
any
kind
of
black
mantle
or
jacket
on
which
they
can
lay
their
hands
and
by
a
habit
they
have
of
crowning
their
heads
with
any
sort
of
hat
or
bonnet
that
may
be
in
the
fashion
at
the
moment
no
matter
whether
it
suits
them
or
not
or
whether
they
have
anything
else
in
their
possession
with
which
it
can
be
worn
the
tan
jackets
which
have
been
so
fashionable
lately
have
in
some
measure
emancipated
the
girls
from
the
tyranny
of
the
black
cape
but
i
do
wish
all
who
dress
at
all
would
do
so
much
more
sensibly
than
they
do
now
and
would
never
buy
a
single
thing
without
carefully
reviewing
their
wardrobe
first
and
then
purchasing
the
addition
equally
carefully
not
because
it
is
or
the
of
the
fashion
but
because
it
suits
the
wearer
and
above
all
suits
what
she
already
possesses
she
must
never
enter
a
shop
without
knowing
first
of
all
what
she
really
does
require
and
she
must
never
allow
herself
to
be
talked
out
of
her
own
preconceived
ideas
if
she
does
she
is
sure
to
find
herself
saddled
with
some
utterly
unwearable
garment
and
which
moreover
matches
nothing
she
already
has
in
her
possession
a
girl
should
be
carefully
taught
what
is
likely
to
suit
her
and
she
should
moreover
be
carefully
instructed
how
to
manage
her
wardrobe
so
that
her
things
may
be
in
some
measure
for
example
should
she
possess
a
sealskin
jacket
which
she
should
if
in
any
way
possible
a
capital
little
coat
costs
about
to
and
wears
ten
winters
comfortably
and
can
be
used
afterwards
as
linings
her
winter
morning
dress
might
be
some
soft
brown
cashmere
she
could
vary
this
by
having
two
or
three
soft
silk
handkerchiefs
as
waistcoats
in
the
pretty
prevailing
fashion
of
the
day
and
could
have
a
dark
brown
a
deep
yellow
or
a
pale
pink
one
this
dress
would
look
well
with
the
sealskin
or
with
a
tan
jacket
should
the
weather
be
too
warm
for
the
former
and
the
hat
should
be
brown
or
else
dark
blue
with
brown
feathers
in
this
would
allow
of
the
second
dress
being
powder
or
gendarme
blue
this
could
be
trimmed
with
bands
of
sealskin
or
soft
brown
silk
and
here
would
be
garments
to
don
in
october
and
wear
off
and
on
until
the
first
few
warm
days
in
may
turn
our
thoughts
to
new
and
lighter
clothes
a
best
hat
should
always
be
in
stock
but
this
must
harmonise
with
what
she
already
has
in
the
way
of
dresses
these
must
be
good
the
two
will
then
with
the
help
of
a
judicious
maid
come
out
again
in
the
following
autumn
as
very
good
dresses
and
dresses
for
wet
sundays
and
all
that
will
be
required
is
an
afternoon
party
dress
which
can
also
be
worn
on
fine
sundays
to
church
and
for
afternoon
wear
should
sunday
callers
be
allowed
and
encouraged
in
the
manner
i
trust
they
are
summer
dresses
are
where
the
strain
comes
on
our
resources
and
where
the
clever
maid
comes
in
so
well
one
can
buy
a
print
costume
unmade
for
about
but
made
up
in
london
it
costs
about
to
i
have
never
seen
a
decently
made
one
under
this
price
the
maid
should
suffice
for
these
costumes
the
simple
banded
norfolk
bodice
being
easily
managed
as
can
some
of
the
looser
bodices
and
great
care
should
be
taken
to
purchase
about
three
yards
more
of
the
print
than
is
absolutely
needed
print
dresses
in
our
wretched
climate
generally
last
two
seasons
and
as
they
generally
shrink
in
the
wash
it
is
wise
to
provide
ourselves
with
material
for
new
sleeves
or
new
fronts
it
can
be
washed
before
being
used
to
ensure
that
no
appearance
of
patching
is
given
by
the
new
unfaded
material
being
placed
against
that
which
must
have
faded
a
little
during
the
last
wear
we
have
discovered
in
stafford
rather
far
cry
as
the
scots
would
say
a
capital
dressmaker
who
for
absolutely
reasonable
prices
makes
charming
print
dresses
for
and
excellent
material
dresses
for
girls
for
about
i
know
these
wear
because
we
have
tried
them
often
and
often
and
indeed
my
daughter
gets
all
her
morning
dresses
there
i
shall
not
publish
her
name
because
i
do
not
want
her
to
be
inundated
with
work
or
raise
her
prices
but
if
she
can
manage
to
do
this
and
naturally
it
must
pay
her
to
do
so
why
london
dressmakers
do
the
same
i
pause
for
a
reply
and
in
the
meantime
meditate
ruefully
on
the
different
prices
i
have
to
pay
for
my
garments
to
those
charged
by
the
stafford
dressmaker
i
have
always
believed
that
ladies
properly
instructed
in
this
art
of
dressmaking
and
banded
together
could
make
a
comfortable
living
out
of
providing
the
garments
of
their
fortunate
sisters
who
had
not
to
work
they
would
not
make
their
fortunes
but
they
should
do
well
if
they
do
not
pitchfork
themselves
into
the
place
because
every
other
work
they
have
tried
has
failed
but
take
it
because
they
have
had
an
excellent
training
and
are
really
tasteful
and
capable
of
advising
about
as
well
as
making
the
clothes
which
are
such
a
burden
and
trouble
to
most
of
us
of
course
they
would
be
invaluable
to
the
girls
with
a
limited
allowance
they
would
know
what
was
worn
what
would
suit
them
and
their
purses
at
the
same
time
and
they
would
keep
a
staff
of
humbler
sewers
who
would
renovate
the
garments
it
should
be
their
pride
and
delight
to
make
the
very
utmost
of
while
to
those
like
myself
for
example
who
must
have
suitable
and
pretty
dresses
and
have
not
sufficient
time
to
obtain
this
desirable
end
without
immense
expense
they
would
be
simply
invaluable
and
we
should
be
spared
making
the
mistakes
we
are
constantly
making
the
while
we
should
be
sure
that
our
advancing
years
should
receive
due
notice
at
their
skilful
hands
and
that
we
should
be
suitably
as
well
as
becomingly
dressed
and
that
at
a
not
undue
expense
i
should
be
very
grateful
to
anyone
who
would
start
such
an
establishment
she
could
charge
for
her
advice
plus
the
dress
as
i
charge
for
my
advice
about
furniture
and
household
management
and
i
am
quite
sure
her
establishment
would
soon
be
the
centre
of
an
admiring
throng
of
girl
disciples
to
say
nothing
of
the
elder
women
who
would
be
thankful
to
be
taken
in
hand
to
be
prevented
from
buying
unbecoming
garments
or
things
which
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
rest
of
their
possessions
and
who
could
shop
there
in
peace
knowing
they
would
have
kindly
counsel
instead
of
being
assured
lyingly
by
the
saleswoman
that
a
perfectly
unsuitable
bonnet
is
the
most
becoming
thing
she
has
ever
seen
and
that
an
ugly
black
mantle
is
so
handsome
that
given
this
it
will
act
as
charity
and
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
in
the
shape
of
a
shabby
dress
the
real
truth
being
that
the
gorgeous
mantle
only
accentuates
the
shabbiness
and
by
adding
another
to
the
rank
of
the
black
mantle
wearers
gives
another
evidence
of
the
fact
that
as
a
rule
englishwomen
in
the
street
are
the
women
in
the
world
to
really
dress
well
costs
an
immense
amount
of
money
for
to
ensure
correct
and
pleasing
dress
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
all
things
shall
match
in
some
measure
mantle
dress
bonnet
and
hose
must
be
but
if
we
can
not
afford
to
go
in
for
this
we
should
restrict
ourselves
to
one
or
two
colours
at
the
outside
we
should
never
buy
anything
which
is
at
the
height
of
fashion
and
above
all
we
should
wear
our
clothes
carefully
and
we
should
not
disdain
to
see
they
are
put
away
in
an
absolutely
spotless
condition
with
each
atom
of
dust
and
dirt
removed
every
small
necessary
mending
done
and
with
soft
paper
between
the
folds
unless
we
have
this
religiously
seen
to
the
handsomest
dress
soon
becomes
and
shabby
while
a
cheap
or
inferior
material
wears
three
times
as
long
as
it
otherwise
would
do
if
we
see
it
is
treated
properly
but
cheap
or
flimsy
materials
should
never
under
any
circumstances
be
bought
unless
the
girls
can
make
them
up
themselves
to
wear
at
home
evenings
or
during
the
summer
or
unless
the
can
do
them
the
making
and
trimming
cost
three
times
as
much
as
the
stuff
which
hardly
looks
nice
for
three
days
while
good
material
pays
for
good
making
and
wears
until
one
is
really
tired
of
being
in
the
same
garment
when
that
feeling
comes
to
us
we
should
lay
the
dress
aside
for
some
months
and
then
take
it
out
again
the
rest
actually
seems
to
have
done
the
garment
good
and
we
wear
it
again
with
pleasure
instead
of
putting
it
on
each
morning
with
renewed
dislike
and
distaste
as
we
did
before
we
put
it
into
the
wardrobe
for
the
short
retirement
we
advise
if
matrons
over
can
not
afford
to
spend
very
much
on
their
garments
i
do
most
strongly
advise
them
to
keep
to
black
and
very
dark
shades
of
greens
and
reds
these
however
should
be
left
absolutely
alone
should
there
be
any
tendency
to
then
black
must
be
this
seems
a
little
hard
and
of
course
black
is
to
a
certain
extent
uninteresting
wear
but
we
can
console
ourselves
for
the
fate
to
which
all
must
come
by
knowing
that
we
are
suitably
attired
and
that
at
all
events
we
are
not
making
ourselves
ridiculous
by
vying
with
our
daughters
about
our
clothes
women
are
the
age
they
look
i
know
some
of
the
age
who
do
not
look
a
day
more
than
and
they
therefore
should
dress
as
they
please
but
the
moment
age
begins
to
show
let
us
calmly
acknowledge
that
our
pretty
days
are
over
and
garb
ourselves
accordingly
we
need
not
be
dowdy
in
these
days
black
and
dark
raiment
generally
can
be
made
as
nice
as
possible
and
quite
but
we
should
be
suitably
dressed
and
after
all
we
want
either
admiration
or
attention
then
from
the
outside
world
we
are
sure
of
both
at
home
if
we
rule
rightly
and
are
queen
of
the
only
kingdom
that
is
worth
having
the
beautiful
kingdom
of
home
what
does
anything
else
matter
if
we
are
still
looked
upon
by
our
husbands
with
as
much
pleasure
and
admiration
as
they
gave
us
in
those
days
of
courtship
and
if
our
children
consider
us
nicer
kinder
and
wiser
than
anyone
else
to
obtain
such
applause
is
worth
the
whole
struggle
of
living
to
preserve
it
any
amount
of
trouble
which
we
can
possibly
take
therefore
let
all
costume
themselves
suitably
the
girl
in
the
prettiest
frocks
she
can
possibly
afford
the
matron
quietly
becomingly
and
richly
and
above
all
let
all
consider
carefully
the
matching
that
i
so
strongly
advocate
and
let
the
girl
who
begins
her
allowance
always
keep
most
correct
accounts
showing
these
and
her
paid
bills
when
the
next
quarter
is
paid
and
let
her
never
be
too
proud
to
ask
her
assistance
especially
if
she
can
not
see
her
way
to
make
both
ends
meet
but
never
pass
over
a
debt
and
let
her
see
you
notice
all
she
spends
it
may
seem
a
little
inquisitorial
it
will
really
save
her
endless
care
and
worry
if
you
prevent
her
in
any
way
you
can
from
getting
into
a
habit
of
forestalling
her
income
a
habit
that
once
formed
is
one
that
hardly
anyone
ever
shakes
off
in
after
life
try
how
one
will
the
are
the
garments
which
try
a
girl
more
than
anything
the
tulle
skirts
and
pretty
flounces
which
cost
so
much
getting
so
soon
spoiled
and
messed
and
i
think
the
stock
of
the
first
dresses
must
be
helped
considerably
by
the
parents
else
will
the
poor
girl
feel
herself
worse
dressed
than
anyone
else
and
that
is
a
small
misery
that
should
never
be
allowed
if
in
any
measure
it
can
be
avoided
the
years
from
eighteen
to
are
undoubtedly
the
most
joyous
of
any
a
woman
ever
has
they
are
not
always
the
happiest
taking
our
standard
of
happiness
very
high
but
they
are
the
brightest
sunniest
and
most
amusing
that
the
average
girl
will
ever
have
more
especially
if
she
have
been
carefully
brought
up
in
a
good
atmosphere
and
be
not
tormented
with
those
uncomfortable
religious
doubts
and
miserable
hankerings
after
a
career
and
after
reforming
the
world
we
some
of
us
had
such
a
severe
attack
of
at
that
age
i
personally
would
not
be
eighteen
again
for
all
the
wealth
of
the
indies
then
i
thought
it
extremely
grand
to
believe
in
nothing
to
have
a
gloomy
satisfaction
in
my
superior
mind
which
soared
above
the
old
beliefs
and
formed
a
misty
religion
of
my
own
which
meant
nothing
and
led
nowhere
and
to
indulge
in
dreadful
sarcasms
mentally
only
i
am
thankful
to
say
i
did
not
often
utter
them
on
the
worldly
wisdom
of
those
folks
who
naturally
wished
their
daughters
to
marry
well
and
turned
cold
shoulders
on
the
poorest
and
generally
most
undeserving
of
suitors
and
i
used
to
stay
up
until
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
although
i
was
dreadfully
sleepy
inditing
the
most
awful
verses
against
the
rich
and
titled
folks
whom
i
naturally
thought
were
fattening
on
the
poor
and
miserable
and
to
whom
i
intended
to
go
on
a
species
of
socialistic
crusade
and
finally
in
writing
a
big
novel
which
used
to
make
me
feel
very
much
more
intellectual
than
most
of
the
people
i
mixed
with
and
which
after
an
evening
spent
among
the
brightest
and
first
intellects
in
the
world
i
used
to
contemplate
savagely
having
been
made
to
feel
very
small
though
i
would
have
died
rather
than
confess
such
a
thing
a
feeling
i
did
not
mean
ever
to
experience
again
once
that
was
given
to
the
world
and
people
really
knew
me
for
the
genius
i
was
alas
that
recognition
has
never
come
yet
still
i
am
very
happy
without
it
and
am
always
doubly
thankful
my
days
of
craving
for
worldwide
fame
have
vanished
and
that
i
neither
want
that
nor
to
believe
in
anything
any
more
i
hope
however
there
are
not
many
girls
as
silly
as
i
was
then
and
as
i
dare
say
i
should
have
continued
to
be
had
i
not
married
i
who
scorned
the
idea
of
the
ordinary
british
matron
and
regarded
children
and
household
cares
with
bitter
disgust
and
during
the
twenty
years
i
have
been
a
wife
i
am
always
struck
with
wonder
when
i
remember
the
imaginative
impulsive
thing
that
was
myself
so
long
ago
and
try
to
trace
in
my
present
self
the
miserable
ambitious
cynic
i
fondly
hoped
was
some
day
going
to
set
the
world
on
fire
and
blossom
out
as
a
new
thackeray
or
dickens
nothing
feminine
was
good
enough
for
me
i
meant
to
beat
the
men
or
do
nothing
at
all
such
a
girlhood
as
that
may
be
of
infinite
service
and
was
but
it
can
not
be
called
a
happy
one
still
i
think
i
was
the
exception
not
the
rule
therefore
i
ask
that
all
who
can
possibly
manage
it
will
see
their
girls
are
happy
as
long
as
they
are
young
to
give
them
their
allowance
because
they
should
learn
how
to
spend
money
but
to
add
a
dress
here
and
there
an
ornament
a
new
trimming
judiciously
if
in
any
way
you
can
afford
it
and
go
without
yourself
rather
than
allow
a
girl
to
be
shabby
or
worry
herself
to
death
over
a
garment
at
the
same
time
let
her
learn
to
do
her
own
repairs
and
have
lessons
in
dressmaking
make
her
happy
but
at
the
same
time
let
her
help
herself
to
the
desired
end
i
hope
there
may
never
be
too
many
daughters
in
the
family
for
this
allowance
of
to
be
an
impossibility
no
girl
can
dress
really
on
less
if
there
are
she
be
taught
early
to
make
her
own
garments
and
she
must
learn
furthermore
that
she
must
spend
far
more
time
and
thought
over
her
clothes
than
is
good
for
her
should
the
allowance
be
much
less
and
should
she
be
obliged
to
go
out
into
society
a
good
deal
as
i
stated
at
first
i
am
not
now
writing
for
the
young
beginners
but
for
those
whose
children
are
growing
up
and
who
have
made
and
are
making
a
good
income
i
therefore
trust
that
what
i
have
said
about
dress
will
be
taken
only
by
those
for
whom
it
is
intended
the
angelina
of
kitchen
to
garret
poor
dear
having
often
enough
to
do
without
much
that
she
would
have
thought
indispensable
in
the
old
days
chapter
viii
christenings
and
weddings
there
is
a
great
deal
to
consider
apart
from
the
mere
arrangement
of
the
ceremonies
about
the
events
of
which
i
mean
to
speak
in
this
chapter
therefore
no
book
devoted
to
the
interests
of
the
home
could
be
complete
without
at
least
some
words
on
both
subjects
to
begin
with
the
old
story
of
the
bad
fairy
told
us
in
our
childhood
who
invariably
was
forgotten
and
as
invariably
turned
up
without
an
invitation
at
the
christening
of
the
prince
or
princess
is
not
as
improbable
as
it
appeared
to
be
on
the
first
reading
the
bad
fairy
may
be
an
infuriated
relative
to
whom
we
have
forgotten
to
write
it
may
be
family
pride
outraged
by
the
name
chosen
for
the
infant
or
it
may
take
the
form
of
having
asked
the
wrong
instead
of
the
right
individual
to
stand
for
the
child
but
all
too
often
it
is
there
and
the
heedless
conduct
that
raised
the
evil
fairy
from
her
sleep
may
bring
about
consequences
that
are
as
unpleasant
as
they
are
certainly
unexpected
and
generally
undeserved
for
i
have
often
observed
that
the
deepest
insults
are
those
we
are
most
unconscious
of
giving
and
that
the
evil
habit
of
is
often
increased
by
conduct
that
was
as
innocent
in
design
as
it
was
certainly
disastrous
in
the
effect
and
now
let
us
pause
for
a
moment
and
speak
on
the
subject
of
taking
offence
a
matter
that
has
given
rise
to
endless
family
divisions
and
caused
more
broken
friendships
and
quarrels
than
anything
else
in
the
world
to
begin
with
it
is
a
sign
of
a
common
jealous
vain
nature
to
take
offence
it
shows
that
the
offended
person
is
so
endued
with
a
sense
of
her
own
importance
that
she
is
always
on
the
for
an
affront
that
she
has
such
a
low
idea
of
human
nature
that
she
is
suspicious
of
everything
that
happens
and
is
always
expecting
some
slur
is
being
cast
on
her
some
dreadful
plot
against
her
dignity
is
being
hatched
and
she
is
so
vain
that
she
thinks
everything
that
happens
is
especially
levied
at
her
though
generally
she
was
as
far
from
the
thoughts
of
the
offending
person
as
she
well
could
be
a
family
possessing
such
a
touchy
member
is
indeed
much
to
be
pitied
one
can
see
nothing
or
very
little
of
any
acquaintance
possessed
of
such
a
disposition
and
indeed
no
one
would
wish
to
see
such
a
one
more
than
one
can
help
but
a
member
of
the
family
must
be
considered
in
some
way
therefore
such
an
individual
is
all
too
often
the
bad
fairy
who
having
once
received
or
fancied
she
received
an
insult
never
forgets
it
harps
on
it
always
and
ends
by
doing
immeasurable
harm
in
more
ways
than
one
by
her
disagreeable
and
untutored
tongue
and
notice
i
say
and
her
i
consider
we
can
learn
much
from
men
but
we
can
certainly
learn
from
them
for
very
seldom
do
we
find
a
man
taking
offence
in
the
childish
and
touchy
fashion
far
too
many
women
are
so
fond
of
doing
as
a
rule
we
are
all
too
busy
to
soften
the
aspirations
of
such
an
individual
and
so
we
drift
apart
without
any
distinct
quarrel
gradually
seeing
less
and
less
of
each
other
until
we
do
not
meet
at
all
but
it
is
generally
well
if
we
possibly
can
to
go
straight
to
anyone
like
this
and
find
out
the
cause
of
offence
at
the
same
time
refraining
from
doing
so
unless
we
care
very
much
about
it
because
ten
chances
to
one
the
person
who
takes
offence
once
will
always
be
doing
so
and
it
is
not
worth
while
as
a
rule
to
conciliate
those
who
will
find
a
subject
for
offence
in
everything
one
says
and
does
unless
one
is
always
flattering
them
an
easily
offended
person
having
the
most
ravenous
appetite
for
flattery
possible
to
conceive
therefore
when
a
christening
has
to
be
thought
about
we
should
first
consider
if
there
be
any
scylla
to
avoid
any
charybdis
past
which
we
must
navigate
the
boat
and
above
all
must
we
endeavour
to
be
quite
independent
about
the
most
important
subject
of
all
viz
how
to
name
the
child
i
do
not
go
quite
as
far
as
does
a
friend
of
mine
who
considers
the
names
he
gives
his
children
act
on
their
nature
and
that
they
insensibly
form
their
characters
to
in
some
measure
sympathise
with
their
baptismal
names
thus
for
example
it
would
be
as
impossible
for
john
to
be
naughty
as
for
jack
to
be
anything
save
a
pickle
for
edith
to
be
anything
save
calm
and
religious
while
trixy
must
be
a
flirt
and
set
all
her
lovers
by
the
ears
but
still
i
do
think
a
great
deal
depends
upon
the
name
especially
if
the
surname
happens
to
be
rather
uncommon
or
pretty
and
that
the
judicious
selection
of
names
does
wonders
but
here
we
must
steer
between
plain
john
brown
who
could
never
be
anyone
try
as
hard
as
he
might
and
the
reginald
de
montmorency
brown
which
is
the
of
the
neighbours
and
which
is
a
grief
to
the
unfortunate
holder
thereof
through
life
unless
the
possession
of
such
a
name
forces
him
to
become
as
ridiculous
as
it
is
itself
then
of
course
he
is
quite
happy
and
we
need
not
pity
him
at
all
another
thing
i
do
most
earnestly
deprecate
is
the
perpetuating
of
family
names
unless
the
name
happens
to
be
a
pretty
one
and
is
chosen
for
itself
in
the
first
place
family
names
are
generally
hideous
and
in
the
second
we
can
not
name
the
child
after
all
the
members
of
both
families
to
give
precedence
to
the
family
names
will
offend
the
family
and
generally
the
unfortunate
infant
is
not
only
saddled
with
a
hideous
name
but
finds
itself
a
bone
of
contention
almost
before
it
has
any
bones
at
all
while
if
we
boldly
select
the
names
which
seem
to
us
euphonious
and
to
harmonise
with
the
surname
we
shall
offend
no
one
and
shall
show
we
have
an
individuality
that
must
be
respected
by
the
members
of
both
families
alike
then
too
if
families
are
large
and
have
endless
branches
great
confusion
is
caused
by
each
separate
paterfamilias
having
one
of
these
names
among
his
flock
cousins
very
often
stay
in
the
same
house
and
come
to
visit
each
other
and
if
there
are
ten
miss
elizabeth
smiths
and
these
happen
to
be
staying
together
how
are
their
letters
to
be
distinguished
the
possession
of
similar
initials
in
families
has
made
mischief
enough
the
possession
of
similar
names
can
make
twice
as
much
again
in
naming
a
boy
we
must
think
whether
he
can
be
made
miserable
at
school
by
having
either
a
grand
or
girlish
name
which
the
young
fiends
his
schoolfellows
can
turn
into
something
to
his
disadvantage
and
if
possible
the
younger
sons
should
always
have
some
good
surname
before
the
family
name
this
will
enable
them
to
keep
distinct
for
example
if
the
eldest
son
is
called
charles
robinson
not
that
i
should
call
any
boy
such
a
frightful
name
his
next
brother
can
be
called
john
smith
robinson
supposing
his
name
to
have
been
smith
while
the
third
could
be
william
brown
robinson
thus
marking
the
distinct
families
at
once
and
allowing
the
sons
of
the
holders
of
these
names
to
have
the
double
name
and
perhaps
the
aristocratic
hyphen
satirised
by
corney
grain
which
is
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
ordinary
suburban
resident
while
it
is
not
a
bad
plan
to
give
the
girls
their
surname
as
well
as
a
pretty
at
baptism
this
would
allow
people
to
trace
pedigrees
easily
were
it
a
universal
custom
and
would
be
of
great
assistance
in
writing
the
family
history
we
ought
one
and
all
of
us
to
possess
for
it
is
astonishing
how
much
we
are
helped
in
our
attempt
to
bring
up
our
children
if
we
have
any
knowledge
of
our
forbears
and
can
trace
in
any
way
the
habits
and
occupations
of
those
from
whom
we
have
sprung
having
settled
on
the
name
and
registered
it
before
we
tell
our
relations
and
friends
the
impossibility
of
making
a
change
saving
endless
painful
and
unprofitable
discussions
the
next
thing
is
to
decide
on
the
as
a
rule
this
is
a
mere
form
but
of
course
it
should
not
be
so
a
necessarily
sends
a
more
or
less
handsome
present
at
the
time
of
the
christening
comes
to
the
ceremony
if
he
or
she
can
and
then
forgets
all
about
the
child
but
this
i
repeat
should
never
be
the
should
keep
up
a
friendly
intercourse
with
their
they
should
know
where
they
are
what
they
are
doing
they
should
most
undoubtedly
be
present
at
the
confirmation
ceremony
and
they
should
always
at
christmas
either
write
to
their
send
one
of
those
useful
and
pretty
cards
which
i
trust
will
never
go
out
of
fashion
or
else
give
some
little
gift
that
does
not
cost
much
while
it
makes
the
link
between
them
very
real
and
gives
some
meaning
to
a
position
that
at
present
would
often
be
more
honoured
in
the
breach
than
in
the
observance
of
course
it
is
easy
enough
to
manage
this
in
own
rank
of
life
and
we
ought
to
have
as
many
as
we
can
honestly
interest
ourselves
in
but
we
should
never
undertake
the
office
unless
we
mean
to
perform
the
duties
and
we
ought
occasionally
to
some
of
our
poorer
children
as
a
rule
they
are
delighted
to
have
us
and
it
gives
us
a
hold
over
them
we
could
not
otherwise
acquire
while
a
boy
or
a
girl
has
always
a
sense
of
obligation
to
behave
better
and
do
better
in
life
if
he
or
she
has
a
in
a
higher
station
than
his
or
her
own
to
whom
they
can
come
for
advice
and
help
by
right
and
from
whom
they
receive
at
christmas
at
confirmation
or
at
any
important
step
in
life
some
trifling
token
therefore
i
do
not
think
can
think
too
much
of
their
duties
or
neglect
to
stand
for
all
they
can
manage
to
look
after
it
is
something
to
do
something
that
can
also
do
endless
good
if
we
undertake
the
duties
properly
when
the
are
chosen
the
should
be
fixed
and
this
should
be
the
very
first
day
that
the
mother
and
child
can
go
out
of
doors
the
clergyman
who
performs
all
the
family
services
should
be
asked
of
course
and
the
time
selected
should
be
about
the
middle
of
the
day
and
if
possible
the
font
should
be
nicely
decorated
with
white
flowers
of
course
the
correct
thing
would
be
to
have
a
public
service
with
the
congregation
the
church
always
looks
dismal
and
horrid
when
empty
and
according
to
the
rubric
the
service
should
be
public
but
i
should
never
advise
this
in
the
first
place
the
mother
is
never
quite
strong
enough
to
stand
the
long
service
and
in
the
second
babies
do
howl
so
that
the
congregation
is
made
miserable
and
therefore
what
is
really
an
excellent
theory
is
a
practice
to
be
avoided
unless
the
christening
is
postponed
a
thing
i
can
not
contemplate
for
one
moment
a
first
outing
should
be
to
church
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
in
my
own
mind
about
that
take
this
for
granted
and
half
the
misery
of
a
christening
disappears
never
allow
it
to
be
postponed
and
it
is
done
as
a
matter
of
course
if
the
selected
can
not
be
present
they
must
be
represented
by
proxy
and
they
should
never
be
waited
for
any
more
than
they
should
be
chosen
for
any
reason
save
that
we
are
fond
of
them
that
they
are
related
to
us
or
such
friends
that
we
know
they
would
do
the
best
they
could
for
us
were
we
to
die
and
leave
the
children
to
the
mercy
of
the
world
at
large
as
regards
their
mental
welfare
i
mean
their
bodily
i
repeat
here
that
no
one
has
the
smallest
right
to
bring
a
child
into
the
world
for
whose
existence
he
can
not
in
some
measure
duly
provide
without
emulating
the
roman
catholic
habit
of
confession
i
much
like
to
feel
that
each
family
possesses
some
clergyman
among
its
friends
who
stands
to
it
in
some
measure
in
the
position
that
a
romish
priest
does
to
many
households
the
finer
ceremonies
of
life
and
death
should
be
conducted
by
one
man
and
it
is
always
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
feel
that
he
who
married
us
christened
all
our
children
while
it
is
as
great
a
regret
that
he
can
not
any
more
perform
any
more
ceremonies
for
us
for
he
has
gone
where
ceremonies
are
of
no
avail
and
where
he
has
no
doubt
already
received
his
reward
however
though
none
can
take
his
place
we
have
still
a
priest
and
i
think
all
the
simple
ceremonies
of
our
church
are
made
a
thousand
times
holier
by
the
fact
that
one
man
performs
them
and
that
he
takes
that
individual
interest
in
us
no
strange
clergyman
ever
can
let
anyone
see
a
christening
in
a
town
church
hastily
performed
by
a
man
to
whom
the
infant
is
nothing
but
an
unpleasant
lump
of
lace
and
fussy
clothes
or
at
best
one
more
little
soldier
for
the
great
army
and
the
same
ceremony
performed
by
a
man
who
knows
and
loves
the
parents
and
i
shall
need
no
more
words
if
this
does
not
express
all
i
mean
let
my
readers
note
the
conduct
of
any
cemetery
chaplain
reading
the
burial
service
with
which
custom
has
made
him
hideously
familiar
and
then
hear
someone
who
has
known
and
loved
the
dead
read
it
i
am
sure
after
that
i
need
not
plead
for
the
election
in
each
family
of
some
good
man
as
family
priest
he
is
a
comfort
indeed
with
whom
no
one
can
afford
to
dispense
even
in
this
hurrying
fashionable
life
of
ours
when
the
church
and
all
is
settled
the
dress
is
undoubtedly
a
matter
for
great
consideration
in
some
families
grandmamma
produces
the
robe
the
father
was
christened
in
and
of
course
that
and
nothing
else
should
be
worn
of
course
equally
high
neck
and
sleeves
should
be
added
and
a
little
flannel
bodice
can
be
placed
with
advantage
under
the
fine
bodice
of
the
robe
white
ribbons
should
tie
up
the
sleeves
and
be
placed
under
the
waist
and
the
cloak
should
not
be
either
heavy
or
unduly
gorgeous
the
hood
and
cloak
must
be
removed
in
the
church
and
the
nurse
should
do
this
quickly
and
silently
the
moment
the
ceremony
begins
placing
a
big
soft
shawl
round
the
child
this
allows
it
to
become
quiet
and
does
not
ensure
the
roar
which
invariably
follows
if
the
child
is
handed
to
the
clergyman
the
moment
its
clothes
are
taken
off
it
should
be
rolled
in
the
shawl
until
the
christening
service
is
over
then
it
can
be
dressed
and
shriek
if
it
likes
no
one
but
the
nurse
will
be
disturbed
by
its
howling
then
baptism
is
a
sacrament
and
therefore
there
are
no
fees
to
be
given
to
the
clergyman
but
the
father
goes
into
the
vestry
to
give
particulars
about
the
name
for
registration
in
the
church
books
and
he
should
then
make
the
clerk
some
small
present
would
be
ample
for
most
families
while
would
be
princely
if
the
clergyman
has
come
some
distance
one
should
take
care
he
was
no
loser
by
it
delicately
and
nicely
and
if
one
is
rich
some
present
should
be
given
to
the
church
itself
to
mark
the
ceremony
there
is
always
something
a
church
lacks
that
we
can
give
without
ruining
ourselves
in
fact
all
these
simple
ceremonies
should
teach
us
to
love
the
church
with
the
singular
attachment
even
dissenters
have
for
it
and
should
make
us
more
to
each
other
as
a
congregation
than
we
otherwise
would
be
had
we
no
religion
to
bind
us
together
the
christening
over
the
baby
should
be
taken
according
to
a
dear
old
yorkshire
superstition
to
be
shown
to
some
friend
who
will
give
it
bread
salt
sixpence
and
a
egg
and
if
this
superstition
be
respected
and
moreover
if
the
infant
be
taken
up
in
the
world
before
it
is
taken
down
carried
upstairs
before
it
goes
down
my
old
nurse
used
to
declare
that
it
must
be
lucky
and
could
defy
any
amount
of
bad
fortune
she
invariably
climbed
by
a
stool
up
to
a
high
settee
with
our
children
because
our
house
had
not
a
third
story
and
much
she
used
to
amuse
us
with
these
small
vagaries
they
were
a
matter
of
real
moment
to
her
and
we
indulged
her
why
not
if
they
did
no
good
they
most
certainly
could
do
no
earthly
harm
now
before
we
pass
on
from
the
christening
ceremony
to
speak
of
weddings
a
much
more
enthralling
subject
i
want
to
say
one
word
on
the
matter
of
family
gatherings
i
know
quite
well
i
am
venturing
almost
on
forbidden
ground
and
that
such
an
idea
as
a
family
party
is
beneath
contempt
in
these
days
when
we
want
nothing
but
amusement
and
dislike
running
the
chance
of
being
bored
more
than
anything
else
still
i
am
going
to
speak
about
them
and
i
trust
that
i
may
show
that
they
are
not
only
unobjectionable
if
properly
managed
but
that
they
are
absolutely
necessary
if
we
are
to
keep
up
anything
like
a
good
feeling
amongst
the
members
of
one
family
the
reasons
why
as
a
rule
families
separate
and
fall
apart
are
first
of
all
because
some
go
up
while
others
remain
stationary
and
others
creep
slowly
down
the
hill
and
secondly
because
there
are
none
of
the
small
civilities
and
amenities
of
life
practised
among
relations
that
render
society
possible
and
pleasing
if
a
sister
thinks
another
conduct
is
not
just
what
it
ought
to
be
she
tells
her
so
without
considering
that
she
has
no
more
business
to
take
her
to
task
than
she
has
to
call
on
and
scold
her
neighbour
they
frankly
discuss
the
manner
in
which
the
respective
children
are
brought
up
and
indeed
often
make
themselves
so
interfering
and
disagreeable
that
the
family
party
ends
in
tears
and
in
mutual
vows
against
any
attempt
at
the
same
thing
again
now
as
regards
the
first
offence
it
is
one
we
ought
to
be
able
to
bear
with
equanimity
especially
if
we
are
remaining
stationary
while
others
are
flourishing
on
a
plain
above
our
heads
in
the
first
place
the
honour
and
success
of
the
one
member
is
the
property
of
all
and
we
can
glory
in
it
too
while
if
we
are
at
the
top
of
the
tree
no
one
will
envy
us
that
position
if
they
share
it
in
some
measure
and
if
we
take
care
that
they
are
not
hurt
by
our
assuming
airs
that
are
as
ridiculous
as
they
are
unkind
a
man
who
forgets
and
ignores
his
poor
relations
is
a
snob
and
is
invariably
laughed
at
by
those
who
know
of
their
existence
while
if
he
never
forgets
them
and
is
good
to
them
always
he
reaps
a
reward
no
one
can
deprive
him
of
in
the
tender
affection
pride
in
his
attainments
and
unselfish
delight
in
his
success
which
would
be
turned
to
gall
and
wormwood
were
he
to
turn
his
back
on
and
ignore
those
whose
flesh
and
blood
he
shares
and
who
must
always
be
his
relations
try
how
he
may
to
shift
them
off
his
shoulders
entirely
give
this
feeling
and
i
maintain
that
we
can
have
family
parties
which
are
quite
successful
more
especially
if
we
remember
the
second
pitfall
and
refrain
from
these
hideously
spiteful
remarks
some
families
seem
to
regard
in
the
light
of
indispensable
tonics
and
we
should
always
try
that
our
simple
ceremonies
of
christenings
birthdays
christmas
and
weddings
should
include
all
those
of
our
immediate
kin
who
are
near
enough
to
share
them
let
all
be
asked
let
them
see
you
are
glad
to
see
them
and
give
them
your
best
not
your
second
best
please
and
i
am
quite
sure
the
family
party
will
be
as
successful
as
any
other
you
may
be
induced
to
give
of
course
the
party
need
not
be
all
family
a
judicious
admixture
of
outsiders
is
always
to
be
recommended
more
especially
if
we
are
at
the
top
of
the
tree
and
can
take
this
opportunity
of
introducing
some
of
our
people
to
those
who
are
pleased
to
meet
them
although
their
present
means
may
not
allow
of
their
entertaining
them
in
their
own
houses
in
the
same
manner
that
we
can
these
differences
can
not
be
helped
and
indeed
they
should
be
a
source
of
pleasure
to
all
as
i
said
before
and
undoubtedly
would
be
were
family
feeling
cultivated
among
us
in
a
manner
that
it
certainly
is
not
in
most
english
homes
therefore
all
these
ceremonies
should
be
made
an
occasion
for
family
parties
and
at
christmas
time
too
all
should
meet
who
can
at
the
house
of
the
eldest
of
the
family
should
the
father
and
mother
be
unable
to
have
their
gathering
or
be
dead
as
is
so
often
the
case
and
there
should
be
regular
preparations
for
enjoyment
a
my
annual
surprise
considerably
shortens
my
life
a
christmas
tree
games
and
a
good
supper
all
mapped
out
just
as
if
we
expected
the
greatest
strangers
and
wished
to
impress
them
with
our
forms
of
hospitality
take
rather
more
pains
about
the
arrangements
and
details
of
a
family
party
than
any
other
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
you
do
you
will
be
amply
rewarded
and
now
to
think
about
weddings
and
marriages
generally
a
most
enthralling
subject
to
fathers
and
mothers
when
the
children
have
grown
up
and
they
begin
to
contemplate
the
idea
of
their
leaving
the
fireside
for
homes
of
their
own
when
begins
i
think
the
most
difficult
period
of
our
life
and
when
we
can
not
be
too
careful
whom
we
admit
to
our
houses
the
while
we
must
not
be
unduly
fussy
else
we
spoil
our
chance
of
happiness
and
make
them
miserably
anxious
for
themselves
and
their
possible
fate
a
fate
i
would
postpone
for
ever
if
i
had
my
way
for
who
can
calmly
contemplate
passing
on
daughter
to
care
i
wonder
while
possible
can
never
be
anything
i
fear
save
successful
rivals
to
the
throne
one
occupies
in
hearts
but
these
things
will
happen
and
equally
of
course
all
girls
should
marry
a
happy
marriage
being
the
best
fate
for
any
woman
no
matter
how
cultivated
how
talented
she
may
be
i
have
no
doubts
whatever
on
that
subject
suppose
she
writes
who
so
fit
to
battle
with
the
publisher
as
the
husband
or
she
paints
well
he
can
smile
on
the
critics
and
undermine
them
with
a
good
cigar
and
all
the
rest
of
it
or
does
she
sing
surely
surely
the
protection
comes
in
there
more
than
ever
while
for
those
lucky
women
who
only
want
to
fulfil
their
destiny
and
make
a
home
the
husband
of
course
takes
his
right
position
at
once
and
is
guardian
and
head
in
a
way
that
nature
intended
him
to
be
and
that
all
real
women
want
him
to
be
the
few
who
clamour
for
another
arrangement
understand
the
subject
at
all
and
are
as
ridiculous
as
they
are
abnormal
and
few
in
number
and
therefore
need
not
be
considered
in
the
least
there
is
therefore
no
doubt
that
women
should
marry
if
they
can
and
if
not
well
there
is
plenty
for
them
to
do
although
they
will
never
be
as
happy
i
am
sure
of
that
as
the
happily
married
woman
neither
will
they
ever
suffer
as
an
unhappily
married
woman
must
albeit
very
many
unhappy
marriages
would
have
been
far
otherwise
had
people
had
common
sense
at
first
and
married
each
other
as
what
they
were
and
not
what
they
supposed
each
other
to
be
resenting
their
own
mistakes
on
the
unfortunate
object
they
had
deified
and
not
on
their
own
stupid
selves
while
of
course
they
should
be
resolved
to
make
the
best
of
what
was
inevitable
and
to
really
make
the
wife
or
husband
become
all
they
had
imagined
him
or
her
to
be
when
the
discussion
on
the
subject
of
being
a
was
going
forward
i
was
only
deterred
from
joining
in
the
fray
by
the
knowledge
that
my
indignant
feelings
on
this
subject
were
so
strong
they
rendered
me
incoherent
but
i
was
glad
i
did
not
for
no
one
could
have
driven
sense
into
the
heads
of
a
good
many
of
the
silly
women
who
wrote
rubbish
about
their
woes
of
course
there
are
unhappy
marriages
plenty
of
them
made
worse
to
my
mind
a
thousand
times
by
our
present
disgracefully
easy
divorce
laws
but
trace
them
to
the
beginning
and
i
venture
to
state
that
one
and
all
of
these
marriages
would
have
been
happy
had
the
parties
to
them
been
properly
brought
up
and
above
all
properly
told
what
marriage
really
means
not
only
to
themselves
but
to
those
who
may
very
probably
come
after
them
not
one
girl
who
marries
but
knows
that
the
man
by
whose
side
she
stands
at
the
altar
is
not
only
her
lover
but
the
possible
father
of
her
children
and
yet
what
mother
would
not
consider
herself
simply
dreadful
were
she
to
say
this
to
her
daughter
when
the
proposal
is
made
and
her
fate
is
yet
in
abeyance
and
yet
what
more
important
matter
could
be
spoken
of
i
think
none
a
girl
who
marries
a
man
an
old
man
for
his
money
even
from
the
very
highest
possible
motives
from
the
idea
may
be
that
she
is
not
only
ensuring
the
safety
of
her
own
future
but
that
of
many
who
may
be
near
and
dear
to
her
is
committing
not
only
a
crime
against
herself
and
her
own
future
but
is
ensuring
that
the
faults
sins
and
selfishnesses
of
the
man
she
marries
are
passed
on
to
endless
generations
and
where
such
a
marriage
is
contemplated
i
maintain
that
a
mother
has
an
imperative
duty
before
her
and
that
she
must
tell
her
daughter
straight
out
that
the
sufferings
she
must
endure
in
her
own
person
in
daily
contact
with
her
future
husband
will
not
be
a
tithe
of
what
will
come
upon
her
when
she
begins
to
recognise
his
sins
and
his
evil
ways
reappearing
in
those
children
who
may
come
to
her
and
who
will
bring
their
own
retribution
with
them
be
sure
of
that
it
is
a
priceless
boon
to
know
that
one
inherits
a
right
and
a
duty
to
be
good
in
the
broadest
sense
of
the
word
i
personally
do
not
care
one
fig
what
a
trade
or
worldly
position
is
so
long
as
he
is
absolutely
honest
and
trustworthy
and
would
not
act
or
speak
an
untruth
and
this
is
the
sort
of
inheritance
we
should
strive
to
hand
on
to
our
children
the
higher
the
station
the
more
should
be
the
endeavour
to
live
in
such
a
way
that
our
example
may
be
valued
but
whatever
the
station
let
us
remember
that
there
is
always
some
one
influenced
by
us
and
that
we
have
obligations
to
them
which
we
must
consider
if
we
want
to
live
a
really
good
life
and
one
of
the
first
things
to
think
of
is
this
question
of
marriage
not
only
because
of
ourselves
but
because
of
the
children
who
may
come
to
us
and
who
must
be
thought
of
before
we
give
our
girls
to
men
who
may
make
them
husbands
perhaps
may
not
them
or
beat
them
but
who
are
not
possessed
of
sufficient
individuality
to
be
the
heads
of
their
own
houses
and
who
have
not
honest
souls
and
some
ambitions
above
the
mere
ruck
of
living
and
making
as
much
money
as
they
possibly
can
not
only
because
such
men
can
never
be
the
makers
and
possessors
of
a
home
but
because
they
may
leave
children
whose
weaknesses
and
wickednesses
may
not
only
break
their
heart
but
may
make
the
world
worse
than
they
find
it
truest
ambition
being
to
make
the
world
or
own
special
corner
thereof
better
than
one
found
it
in
some
way
or
other
young
people
naturally
resent
advice
and
rarely
if
ever
act
upon
it
and
we
have
all
taken
this
to
heart
so
much
that
some
of
us
have
ceased
to
give
advice
at
all
but
this
should
not
be
so
the
advice
may
not
be
taken
that
we
can
not
help
but
it
is
our
duty
to
give
it
and
i
hope
all
mothers
will
do
so
whether
their
children
act
upon
it
or
not
we
should
not
shirk
a
duty
because
we
can
not
see
any
effects
they
may
appear
even
when
we
have
long
ceased
to
look
for
them
the
sins
of
the
fathers
must
be
visited
on
the
children
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
we
need
not
argue
about
it
it
is
a
fact
that
we
all
have
to
acknowledge
and
therefore
there
is
no
need
to
go
into
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
the
matter
for
no
amount
of
argument
will
do
away
with
this
inevitable
truth
and
equally
therefore
a
woman
should
choose
not
only
a
man
she
loves
but
a
man
she
respects
and
one
it
shall
be
her
very
greatest
pride
to
know
her
children
will
resemble
she
will
be
spared
endless
suffering
if
she
do
for
there
is
no
suffering
on
earth
like
that
caused
by
wicked
children
or
even
by
the
anxieties
about
weakly
and
suffering
children
and
she
had
better
remain
an
old
maid
all
her
life
than
bring
upon
herself
the
unspeakable
wretchedness
of
having
children
who
are
a
constant
source
of
anxiety
to
her
because
of
what
they
may
nay
of
what
they
inherit
given
a
clean
record
a
stainless
youth
a
good
constitution
and
an
honest
worker
and
we
need
ask
no
more
for
our
girls
it
will
not
hurt
them
to
begin
their
new
life
on
a
much
lower
scale
than
that
which
they
have
been
accustomed
to
more
especially
if
we
have
taught
them
their
duty
to
themselves
and
their
future
then
if
we
know
that
the
young
couple
honestly
love
each
other
we
can
feel
content
and
by
love
i
do
not
mean
blind
unreasoning
passion
the
mad
extraordinary
feeling
that
one
reads
about
in
novels
and
which
generally
lands
one
or
the
other
in
the
divorce
court
and
of
which
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
i
do
mean
that
wonderful
to
another
the
mutual
respect
and
regard
and
the
absolute
unselfishness
that
make
up
the
true
love
that
never
fades
and
that
increases
year
by
year
in
those
whose
married
life
was
based
on
such
love
as
this
and
whose
home
reflects
around
the
happiness
which
is
centred
there
and
which
can
only
be
procured
by
those
who
begin
their
life
together
on
a
proper
basis
and
who
do
not
expect
to
find
in
each
other
the
god
or
goddess
of
perfection
who
would
probably
be
as
unpleasant
to
live
with
as
he
or
she
is
undoubtedly
in
this
world
of
ours
of
course
all
this
sounds
fearfully
prosaic
and
is
no
doubt
philosophy
but
it
would
not
be
worth
writing
down
if
it
were
not
because
it
would
be
imagination
only
and
not
the
fruits
of
experience
i
have
lived
a
certain
number
of
years
and
i
have
had
large
opportunities
of
observation
and
i
am
certain
of
what
i
am
saying
that
the
truest
marriages
are
those
which
are
framed
on
respect
as
well
as
love
and
that
those
women
are
the
happiest
who
can
implicitly
trust
and
believe
in
the
men
to
whom
they
have
given
themselves
in
some
measure
body
and
soul
and
that
furthermore
they
get
the
most
out
of
life
who
take
care
every
moment
they
live
has
something
to
occupy
it
and
that
that
occupation
benefits
someone
beside
their
immediate
selves
i
have
often
heard
people
say
that
the
first
year
of
their
married
life
and
indeed
that
the
honeymoon
itself
was
the
very
dullest
and
most
difficult
period
of
their
whole
lives
but
i
have
always
listened
to
these
statements
with
astonishment
for
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
what
they
say
is
true
it
must
be
that
like
the
despised
family
parties
it
is
because
they
did
not
manage
their
affairs
properly
why
the
honeymoon
should
be
the
most
amusing
journey
one
ever
makes
i
know
mine
was
for
one
sets
out
together
with
an
entertaining
feeling
that
the
absence
of
the
chaperon
for
the
first
time
gives
just
a
of
delightful
impropriety
to
the
journey
that
for
absolutely
the
first
time
in
life
one
can
go
where
one
likes
and
do
as
one
likes
that
if
one
liked
to
put
on
sunday
frock
on
a
one
would
only
be
admired
and
not
scolded
and
that
shopping
becomes
actually
important
and
not
frivolous
because
it
is
for
the
house
and
not
for
oneself
merely
besides
there
is
the
amusement
of
seeing
new
places
with
a
congenial
spirit
and
with
one
who
does
not
consider
it
his
duty
to
insist
on
learning
all
he
can
about
a
place
in
fact
the
honeymooners
are
no
longer
children
to
be
educated
but
people
bent
on
amusing
themselves
together
with
no
these
come
afterwards
then
business
has
become
dreadfully
imperative
in
its
demands
on
the
husband
while
the
wife
leaves
home
for
a
holiday
her
mind
distracted
between
pleasure
and
a
melancholy
foreboding
of
what
may
happen
during
her
absence
to
children
and
household
neither
of
which
can
naturally
trouble
her
during
that
first
delightful
jaunt
which
should
always
be
to
some
amusing
bright
place
where
theatres
can
be
fallen
back
on
should
it
be
wet
or
where
picture
galleries
could
be
visited
under
similar
adverse
circumstances
one
can
visit
the
dullest
of
places
safely
together
after
one
has
been
married
years
there
are
then
mutual
interests
which
will
always
occupy
husband
and
wife
but
at
first
this
is
actual
suicide
there
are
then
not
very
many
things
to
discuss
and
the
unfortunate
young
people
fall
back
on
endearments
and
use
up
in
a
month
that
which
should
last
them
comfortably
for
all
their
lives
but
we
are
arriving
at
the
honeymoon
before
we
have
allowed
the
engagement
and
must
therefore
retrace
our
steps
or
else
we
shall
omit
the
most
important
item
of
all
viz
how
to
act
when
we
see
an
engagement
is
imminent
and
we
are
not
sure
if
we
like
it
or
not
we
should
soon
make
up
our
minds
on
the
subject
though
for
if
we
do
not
approve
we
can
easily
manage
that
the
young
people
shall
not
meet
any
more
it
only
requires
tact
and
common
sense
two
qualities
which
seem
to
me
often
strangely
lacking
in
the
ordinary
british
household
and
indeed
all
that
appertains
to
matrimony
is
made
very
difficult
by
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
english
society
looks
upon
the
relations
between
young
men
and
girls
in
some
measure
allowing
great
familiarity
and
in
another
way
turning
on
anyone
and
calling
her
should
the
unfortunate
individual
attempt
to
bring
together
those
she
thinks
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
of
each
other
indeed
why
i
consider
it
the
duty
of
every
happily
married
woman
to
try
and
make
others
happy
in
a
similar
way
and
i
have
known
more
than
one
happy
woman
rendered
a
miserably
disappointed
spinster
just
because
the
right
person
was
not
at
hand
to
manage
a
last
meeting
or
give
the
one
opportunity
that
was
all
that
was
required
to
make
liking
into
love
or
to
ensure
the
speaking
of
the
question
that
had
trembled
on
the
lips
for
some
time
of
course
marriages
are
made
in
heaven
but
i
also
know
that
heaven
helps
those
who
help
themselves
and
as
no
girl
can
do
that
it
is
the
duty
of
her
married
friends
to
help
her
especially
if
they
have
any
common
sense
and
can
act
ex
without
letting
anyone
know
what
they
have
done
if
our
young
people
are
in
with
the
wrong
man
or
the
wrong
girl
all
the
better
that
the
love
is
desperate
it
will
burn
itself
out
all
the
quicker
but
not
if
we
oppose
the
match
tooth
and
nail
though
at
the
same
time
we
need
not
countenance
it
we
should
under
these
adverse
circumstances
state
calmly
but
boldly
the
reasons
we
have
for
our
dislikes
we
should
simply
put
all
the
we
know
in
plain
words
and
we
should
listen
to
the
equally
calmly
and
we
should
never
allow
a
dislike
to
make
any
difference
in
the
matter
but
our
reasons
should
be
valid
and
not
of
the
kind
then
if
the
daughter
or
son
is
not
convinced
say
no
more
do
not
oppose
it
let
the
young
people
see
as
much
as
they
can
of
each
other
if
there
are
disagreeable
relations
make
them
very
welcome
to
your
house
be
civil
but
not
affectionate
to
the
man
or
girl
and
finally
be
or
rather
appear
to
be
absolutely
indifferent
make
a
fuss
rage
and
stamp
and
oppose
and
you
may
at
the
same
time
order
the
trousseau
act
as
i
advise
and
ten
chances
to
one
the
match
will
be
broken
off
but
if
it
is
not
and
should
it
turn
out
well
be
the
first
to
thankfully
acknowledge
it
should
it
turn
out
badly
refrain
from
the
delightful
habit
of
saying
told
you
so
but
instead
recall
to
the
offended
party
all
the
reasons
he
or
she
had
for
marrying
do
not
condole
but
rather
remind
him
or
her
of
the
early
days
and
of
the
love
that
once
existed
and
remind
them
that
marriage
once
entered
into
must
be
made
the
best
of
you
will
do
far
more
good
and
have
far
more
satisfaction
in
healing
the
breach
than
in
proving
yourself
a
true
prophet
for
if
people
were
more
sure
than
they
are
now
that
being
bound
they
can
not
get
loose
they
would
cease
to
strain
against
the
cords
use
would
accustom
them
to
them
and
finally
what
was
once
irksome
would
be
pleasurable
people
who
have
once
loved
each
other
can
always
remember
the
happy
days
of
their
youth
and
remembering
them
naturally
will
long
to
return
to
them
or
to
secure
at
least
in
some
measure
a
reflex
of
them
in
their
middle
age
but
having
contemplated
this
side
of
the
picture
let
us
look
at
the
far
pleasanter
one
where
all
goes
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
and
the
engagement
is
all
that
it
should
be
yet
before
we
do
this
i
must
just
add
one
other
word
and
that
is
that
come
what
may
no
marriage
should
ever
be
entered
on
on
any
pretext
whatever
unless
the
consent
if
not
the
approbation
of
the
parents
has
been
obtained
i
have
seen
several
marriages
begin
like
this
i
have
never
seen
one
that
turned
out
well
or
that
was
absolutely
a
success
and
i
do
wish
my
readers
to
remember
that
this
is
a
fact
and
to
therefore
refrain
from
conduct
that
can
have
but
one
result
besides
which
how
can
the
children
of
such
marriages
turn
out
if
one
has
no
control
over
them
should
they
desire
to
do
likewise
for
they
have
the
one
unanswerable
argument
in
their
possession
did
it
why
should
not
i
then
also
a
man
never
really
respects
a
woman
who
throws
over
every
one
of
her
relations
for
him
he
knows
he
is
not
worth
the
sacrifice
and
though
he
may
be
flattered
at
first
ultimately
he
despises
the
girl
who
gave
up
all
for
him
and
never
really
regards
her
with
the
reverence
he
must
give
to
her
who
comes
to
him
from
her
home
from
her
hand
knowing
that
that
home
is
the
emptier
for
her
absence
and
that
a
place
should
always
be
kept
there
for
her
should
she
require
to
return
there
for
any
reason
whatever
home
should
be
always
home
to
the
married
children
of
the
household
just
as
much
as
it
is
to
those
who
remain
spinsters
and
bachelors
and
on
no
account
should
the
doors
be
closed
on
them
or
should
they
be
allowed
to
feel
that
they
have
become
in
a
measure
strangers
there
and
that
their
place
being
filled
knows
and
requires
them
no
more
the
trousseau
of
a
girl
should
be
as
ample
as
can
be
afforded
and
should
have
more
than
anything
else
dresses
alter
in
fashion
so
rapidly
that
it
is
folly
to
burden
her
with
too
many
garments
neither
are
unmade
costumes
any
use
in
these
days
when
no
good
dressmaker
will
make
up
own
materials
i
should
therefore
give
a
girl
not
less
than
two
dozen
of
every
feminine
garment
and
as
many
more
of
each
as
i
could
afford
a
good
trousseau
would
cost
about
and
of
course
as
much
more
as
the
parents
are
prepared
to
spend
it
should
include
a
sealskin
coat
and
a
long
fur
cloak
the
other
outside
garments
should
of
course
depend
upon
fashion
and
time
of
year
but
it
is
a
good
plan
to
have
some
extra
yards
of
material
to
all
the
dresses
particularly
if
the
bride
is
going
away
from
london
to
a
distant
part
of
the
world
when
the
engagement
is
really
formed
and
the
wedding
is
beginning
to
be
the
subject
of
conversation
one
can
not
say
all
the
difficulties
are
over
there
are
the
family
to
welcome
and
be
introduced
to
and
though
of
course
if
the
bridegroom
is
well
known
to
us
this
initial
difficulty
will
not
have
to
be
encountered
in
all
its
worst
forms
still
very
often
the
engagement
alters
relationships
suddenly
and
it
requires
careful
steering
then
to
avoid
friction
as
a
rule
the
parents
on
both
sides
think
their
children
might
have
done
better
and
it
is
generally
difficult
to
prevent
this
feeling
being
unduly
apparent
then
i
do
beg
for
all
my
girl
friends
that
they
may
have
a
pretty
wedding
i
do
not
want
enormous
sums
spent
on
the
wedding
dress
but
i
do
want
the
church
to
be
nicely
decked
all
her
friends
to
be
asked
who
care
to
come
not
because
they
may
possibly
give
wedding
presents
a
species
of
blackmail
which
has
become
seriously
unpleasant
lately
to
anyone
who
is
not
sufficiently
to
refuse
to
give
because
they
are
afraid
of
being
out
of
the
fashion
but
because
they
are
really
friends
and
will
bring
good
luck
by
their
loving
prayers
and
real
affection
and
i
do
deprecate
for
all
the
hurried
in
a
frock
a
woman
should
be
in
white
on
her
festal
day
and
it
should
be
indeed
a
festal
day
if
her
marriage
is
entered
on
in
the
spirit
i
have
been
writing
about
i
love
a
pretty
wedding
the
bride
in
her
lovely
white
dress
and
her
group
of
bridesmaids
the
church
the
hymns
and
the
bright
faces
of
the
choir
boys
i
must
own
i
have
a
great
weakness
for
choir
boys
and
generally
make
friends
with
them
all
are
all
such
a
bright
beginning
to
a
new
life
and
if
the
solemn
words
are
spoken
by
the
priest
the
man
who
may
be
married
the
parents
and
christened
and
prepared
the
bride
for
confirmation
there
remains
nothing
to
be
desired
and
we
can
wish
the
new
home
knowing
our
wishes
will
have
every
chance
of
being
fulfilled
afternoon
weddings
with
the
tables
and
the
inexpensive
refreshments
bring
pretty
weddings
within
the
reach
of
everyone
nearly
even
the
erstwhile
elaborately
decorated
cake
now
bears
a
wreath
of
simple
and
real
flowers
instead
of
the
pinchbeck
temple
that
used
to
be
reared
on
the
centre
and
all
that
is
required
besides
is
a
certain
amount
of
cake
ices
tea
and
coffee
and
a
little
wine
here
again
the
expenditure
can
be
regulated
by
the
income
but
it
need
not
be
an
expensive
affair
unless
one
specially
desires
that
it
may
be
now
most
people
are
married
by
banns
and
licences
are
rarely
required
this
simplifies
matters
very
much
but
before
the
wedding
is
definitely
decided
on
i
should
advise
the
clergyman
of
the
church
one
is
always
in
the
habit
of
attending
being
consulted
about
all
the
legal
forms
he
is
sure
to
know
all
that
is
necessary
will
tell
you
exactly
what
you
ought
to
do
what
the
choir
and
organist
will
expect
of
course
if
the
organist
be
a
gentleman
as
he
often
is
and
a
personal
friend
you
must
give
him
a
present
not
money
and
what
steps
you
must
take
about
the
decorations
but
do
not
hand
these
over
to
a
shop
be
sentimental
for
once
and
let
personal
friends
undertake
this
duty
i
would
rather
have
hideous
decorations
put
up
by
hands
that
loved
one
on
such
an
occasion
than
the
most
exquisite
trophies
ever
designed
by
green
and
put
up
by
those
who
do
not
even
know
the
bride
and
bridegroom
by
sight
i
do
hope
every
bride
may
soon
have
her
just
like
all
french
and
german
maidens
have
but
in
any
case
she
must
not
go
penniless
upon
her
wedding
tour
coventry
idea
in
the
of
the
house
that
his
bride
asked
him
to
pay
for
the
will
you
pay
as
a
matter
of
course
is
a
mere
notion
i
am
certain
she
must
have
hated
to
do
it
and
would
have
given
anything
for
some
money
of
her
own
so
do
not
let
paterfamilias
forget
this
even
if
he
have
the
conscience
to
allow
his
daughter
to
go
penniless
into
her
house
and
let
him
give
his
daughter
a
nice
little
sum
of
money
in
order
that
she
may
not
have
to
ask
her
husband
for
a
farthing
until
their
return
home
when
the
allowance
question
should
be
gone
into
and
settled
thus
doing
away
with
the
constant
jar
about
money
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
more
matrimonial
unhappiness
than
is
anything
else
i
think
i
have
said
all
that
is
to
be
said
on
the
subject
of
weddings
and
have
stated
boldly
how
best
to
secure
the
happiness
of
our
children
it
is
a
subject
on
which
i
feel
very
deeply
and
when
i
see
girls
marry
men
who
can
not
by
any
possibility
make
good
husbands
or
good
fathers
i
long
to
tell
them
this
but
of
course
no
one
but
their
mothers
can
and
i
shall
hope
that
i
may
influence
one
or
two
to
do
so
and
moreover
to
insist
that
their
children
do
not
marry
to
perpetuate
the
disease
or
the
evil
tendencies
that
must
wreck
innocent
lives
that
have
no
business
ever
to
exist
for
while
if
marriage
is
entered
into
properly
there
can
be
no
failure
about
it
marriage
being
the
perfection
of
life
the
uniting
and
joining
of
the
two
lives
which
separate
are
indeed
incomplete
but
which
brought
together
form
an
absolute
and
wonderful
whole
a
marriage
which
perpetuates
the
vices
of
a
drunkard
of
an
evil
temper
of
an
habitual
liar
or
the
constitution
of
a
consumptive
or
of
a
lunatic
is
absolutely
wicked
and
can
never
be
anything
but
a
curse
to
the
wife
and
mother
whatever
it
may
be
to
the
man
himself
a
has
discounted
his
chances
of
a
happy
married
life
no
woman
can
reform
a
and
even
if
she
could
she
should
not
try
because
in
her
children
she
will
perpetuate
the
vices
and
will
make
the
world
worse
a
thousandfold
by
those
she
brings
into
it
while
at
the
best
she
may
save
a
soul
though
i
personally
do
not
believe
she
could
even
do
this
at
all
events
it
is
not
right
to
sacrifice
her
future
and
her
future
in
the
endeavour
and
therefore
i
hope
she
may
never
try
as
i
said
before
we
can
not
explain
away
the
mysterious
influence
of
heredity
but
as
it
exists
and
is
inexorable
in
its
consequences
we
must
acknowledge
it
and
we
must
all
do
our
best
so
to
live
that
we
can
give
our
children
the
noblest
inheritance
on
earth
an
unimpaired
constitution
and
a
name
unstained
by
any
mean
or
low
vice
a
name
that
may
be
our
proudest
possession
aye
even
if
we
saw
it
first
above
the
window
of
some
suburban
shop
then
shall
the
world
become
better
because
we
have
lived
in
it
and
given
it
hostages
also
and
so
shall
we
prove
what
i
should
like
to
be
always
preaching
that
marriage
is
the
most
blessed
state
on
earth
if
it
is
begun
and
carried
on
mutually
with
esteem
affection
and
real
consideration
for
each
welfare
chapter
ix
about
the
boys
the
poor
boys
when
i
begin
to
write
about
their
home
i
could
almost
weep
when
i
think
how
small
a
space
of
their
young
lives
they
are
permitted
to
spend
under
the
home
roof
i
have
said
so
much
in
my
former
book
about
home
education
that
i
suppose
i
must
not
say
very
much
more
now
but
i
long
to
repeat
my
protest
against
the
present
manner
in
which
boys
are
sent
away
from
home
almost
before
they
are
able
to
stand
alone
quite
before
they
are
able
to
withstand
all
the
thousand
and
one
temptations
that
assail
them
the
moment
they
are
turned
into
the
herd
of
boys
which
represents
a
school
and
where
the
poor
things
have
to
spend
most
of
what
ought
to
be
the
very
happiest
part
of
life
however
as
public
opinion
is
against
me
i
am
going
to
set
down
here
the
best
way
of
mitigating
the
evils
and
i
also
intend
to
give
the
relative
expenses
at
some
of
the
best
of
our
public
schools
and
colleges
so
that
those
who
read
this
book
may
see
at
a
glance
whether
they
can
afford
to
send
their
boys
to
harrow
eton
rugby
or
clifton
harrow
being
put
first
by
me
as
i
am
devoted
to
the
bright
healthy
happy
place
as
i
suppose
all
are
devoted
to
the
public
school
of
which
they
know
most
for
much
as
i
deprecate
the
life
at
school
which
is
so
far
away
from
home
influence
and
much
as
i
should
prefer
to
live
at
harrow
and
have
my
boys
home
at
night
there
is
something
about
a
public
school
education
which
nothing
else
gives
and
which
can
be
entered
fearlessly
at
fourteen
if
the
boy
have
been
well
trained
and
if
he
have
a
certain
amount
of
moral
courage
and
good
principles
of
his
own
it
is
madness
to
send
a
lad
who
inherits
evil
propensities
to
a
public
school
he
is
sure
sooner
or
later
to
disgrace
himself
and
his
wretched
parents
at
the
same
time
but
before
going
into
the
question
of
schools
and
expenses
there
let
us
dwell
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
in
the
house
which
should
ever
be
the
happiest
place
in
the
world
to
them
and
from
which
should
flow
that
stream
of
sympathy
in
their
progress
their
pursuits
and
their
general
welfare
which
has
borne
many
a
lad
on
to
success
and
to
a
brilliant
place
in
the
world
in
after
life
an
authority
told
me
once
that
the
boys
who
did
best
were
undoubtedly
those
who
had
most
letters
from
home
who
knew
everything
that
was
happening
at
home
just
as
well
as
if
they
were
there
to
whom
the
movements
of
the
family
and
of
the
animals
were
as
familiar
as
if
they
still
were
among
them
and
who
were
not
afraid
to
tell
their
parents
anything
sympathy
is
a
priceless
gift
sympathy
between
home
and
the
boys
at
school
is
an
anchor
indeed
and
will
keep
them
safely
in
the
harbour
when
every
other
means
might
otherwise
have
failed
and
this
sympathy
can
but
be
expressed
in
constant
communication
between
home
and
school
and
by
a
loving
care
while
the
boys
are
absent
of
their
rooms
their
belongings
and
the
especial
niche
which
should
be
kept
sacredly
for
them
and
not
cleared
out
hastily
for
them
to
inhabit
as
it
were
on
sufferance
during
the
all
too
brief
holiday
time
they
spend
at
home
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
during
their
absence
the
rooms
should
never
be
used
that
would
be
simply
too
ridiculous
but
they
should
not
be
taken
into
household
wear
if
they
are
they
cease
to
be
the
rooms
and
in
consequence
the
boys
feel
they
are
a
nuisance
and
putting
some
one
else
out
they
do
not
naturally
take
their
places
in
the
circle
feeling
they
are
filling
a
gap
which
has
never
been
filled
since
the
day
they
returned
to
school
i
should
certainly
try
to
have
a
place
set
apart
for
the
boys
for
wet
days
and
for
their
own
special
occupations
if
this
can
not
be
managed
their
bedrooms
should
be
so
arranged
that
at
one
end
they
can
carry
on
their
several
hobbies
without
doing
any
damage
to
the
finer
portions
of
the
house
but
if
in
any
way
possible
secure
a
for
them
where
they
can
do
as
they
like
and
if
you
want
really
perfect
holidays
find
some
enthusiastic
skater
cricketer
or
walker
as
holiday
tutor
and
make
him
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
the
boys
as
they
do
not
live
at
home
naturally
there
is
no
one
told
off
to
keep
special
care
of
them
or
to
go
about
with
them
if
this
is
done
the
holidays
pass
without
a
hitch
and
without
unduly
threatening
the
life
who
try
as
she
will
can
not
be
sure
that
if
the
boys
are
out
alone
for
half
an
hour
longer
than
usual
they
are
not
drowned
or
lost
or
lying
in
ditches
with
broken
legs
and
who
can
never
school
herself
to
be
their
companion
even
should
she
be
strong
enough
to
be
so
because
she
is
always
expecting
something
dreadful
to
happen
to
them
at
least
i
know
what
i
feel
on
the
subject
and
i
suppose
i
only
feel
what
everyone
else
does
in
the
matter
in
the
rooms
whether
bed
or
sitting
rooms
i
advise
always
the
invaluable
dado
this
ensures
the
lower
parts
of
the
wall
being
kept
tidy
and
minimises
the
expense
of
doing
the
rooms
up
when
they
become
shabby
a
rail
along
the
floor
or
rather
a
piece
of
wood
about
three
inches
wide
laid
along
the
floor
close
to
the
wainscoting
will
keep
the
chairs
off
the
paint
and
then
if
we
have
a
pretty
paper
above
the
serviceable
matting
or
cretonne
or
arras
cloth
which
forms
the
dado
we
shall
be
quite
safe
to
preserve
the
room
for
some
time
looking
fresh
and
nice
and
bright
if
baths
have
to
be
taken
in
the
rooms
or
if
they
clean
their
rifles
skates
or
other
matters
there
or
if
they
have
pet
animals
which
share
their
abode
i
strongly
advise
that
the
floor
should
be
covered
with
a
plain
good
linoleum
without
any
pattern
on
and
then
on
the
top
of
that
a
strong
square
of
carpet
should
be
laid
is
a
capital
carpet
and
so
is
square
carpet
this
should
not
be
fastened
down
in
any
way
and
should
be
most
rigorously
folded
back
by
the
housemaid
during
those
hours
when
bathing
or
dirty
work
is
being
carried
on
the
linoleum
can
always
be
cleaned
with
soft
warm
water
and
kept
in
order
with
boiled
oil
and
turpentine
and
the
carpet
can
be
put
back
in
a
moment
thus
making
the
room
tidy
at
once
rubbishy
cheap
furniture
should
never
be
bought
for
a
room
naturally
by
this
i
do
not
mean
we
should
be
unduly
reckless
over
what
we
buy
for
the
boys
but
that
we
should
go
to
some
good
man
like
wallace
and
tell
him
that
we
want
good
seasoned
wood
and
handles
which
will
not
pull
off
and
drawers
and
doors
which
will
not
stick
and
which
will
not
tempt
the
lads
by
such
conduct
to
undue
violence
in
the
matter
boys
are
always
in
a
hurry
always
impatient
they
help
it
it
is
a
failing
of
the
sex
and
half
the
damage
boys
do
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
we
do
not
realise
this
and
often
give
them
rickety
or
common
furniture
because
is
good
enough
for
the
boys
to
knock
there
can
not
be
a
greater
mistake
give
strong
ash
furniture
made
properly
a
good
plain
brass
and
iron
bedstead
and
a
good
chain
mattress
and
we
shall
find
it
pay
yes
even
if
the
boys
play
ship
on
the
mattress
the
necessary
waves
being
well
represented
by
the
manner
in
which
the
mattress
goes
up
and
down
when
jumped
upon
by
the
intrepid
sailors
our
mattresses
have
served
as
ships
and
as
oceans
too
but
they
are
as
good
now
as
the
day
they
were
bought
simply
because
they
were
very
expensive
but
if
they
had
not
been
dear
i
think
there
would
have
been
anything
left
of
them
by
now
therefore
cheapness
is
no
economy
as
regards
mattresses
at
any
rate
of
that
i
am
quite
convinced
a
good
suite
of
ash
furniture
containing
wardrobe
washing
stand
and
toilet
table
can
be
had
for
about
and
i
do
not
advise
less
being
given
this
should
be
supplemented
by
a
chest
of
drawers
to
hold
shirts
socks
and
the
boots
should
be
kept
either
downstairs
in
the
or
else
in
a
proper
boot
cupboard
and
i
strongly
advise
the
toilet
covers
to
be
in
art
serge
simply
trimmed
by
a
species
of
edging
in
crewels
composed
of
about
nine
stitches
one
long
one
shorter
each
side
of
the
long
stitch
and
one
each
side
shorter
still
like
this
this
should
be
carried
round
the
edges
of
the
cover
in
a
lighter
shade
than
the
serge
itself
and
would
cost
about
a
cover
or
indeed
less
as
serge
is
double
width
there
would
be
no
ball
fringe
to
pull
off
by
shutting
it
heedlessly
in
a
drawer
and
there
would
be
nothing
we
could
not
easily
replace
should
blacking
paint
oil
or
any
of
the
thousand
and
one
messes
in
which
boys
seem
to
revel
be
spilled
upon
it
white
toilet
covers
are
absolutely
useless
and
of
course
it
would
be
really
ridiculous
to
give
them
more
elaborate
covers
which
could
only
be
spoiled
it
would
not
be
of
much
use
here
to
give
any
special
schemes
of
decoration
for
rooms
but
i
may
say
that
the
cheaper
the
wall
paper
is
above
the
dado
the
better
boys
are
continually
adding
to
their
stores
of
pictures
and
ornaments
and
are
as
continually
shooting
at
a
mark
on
the
wall
with
anything
that
comes
handy
and
are
not
above
giving
the
flowers
on
the
paper
a
nose
or
a
mouth
from
which
a
pipe
proceeds
or
ears
which
resemble
those
of
a
donkey
and
though
these
decorations
may
be
left
a
certain
time
it
is
best
to
have
such
a
paper
which
while
being
pretty
is
one
that
we
can
replace
without
an
undue
struggle
on
our
part
and
i
may
mention
capital
blue
and
papers
the
blue
could
have
blue
paint
and
a
blue
matting
dado
and
a
yellow
and
white
ceiling
paper
the
might
have
ivory
paint
a
and
green
cretonne
dado
and
curtains
of
the
same
cretonne
helbronner
has
a
beauty
at
a
yard
and
the
ceiling
paper
could
be
pale
green
and
white
at
the
piece
dull
green
would
make
a
capital
square
there
as
would
his
red
lily
in
the
blue
room
where
the
cretonne
could
be
red
and
blue
westminster
cretonne
which
should
be
lined
as
should
all
cretonnes
which
do
duty
for
blinds
as
well
as
curtains
this
all
curtains
should
do
had
i
my
way
entirely
in
the
matter
the
walls
and
books
and
pictures
should
be
the
own
choice
and
so
should
be
the
ornaments
on
the
though
a
clock
should
be
invariably
provided
and
this
should
be
one
the
veracity
of
which
should
be
unimpeachable
punctuality
must
be
enforced
and
hours
kept
and
no
excuses
should
be
allowed
on
this
score
if
the
youth
declares
he
wishes
to
make
up
for
his
perforce
straitened
hours
of
repose
at
school
let
him
go
to
bed
as
early
as
he
likes
never
interfere
with
that
but
do
not
weakly
allow
him
to
be
late
in
the
morning
it
puts
out
the
whole
household
and
for
no
reason
at
all
and
should
never
be
countenanced
for
a
moment
late
hours
in
the
morning
mean
more
than
i
have
space
to
dilate
on
here
but
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
a
household
which
is
late
in
the
morning
is
never
a
or
prosperous
one
late
hours
then
denote
lazy
habits
and
therefore
should
never
be
allowed
if
the
boys
begin
them
in
the
holidays
be
sure
they
will
be
continued
after
school
is
left
and
therefore
be
firm
on
this
point
although
i
know
all
too
well
how
difficult
it
is
to
be
stern
and
inflexible
towards
the
boys
who
are
only
at
home
for
the
holidays
and
naturally
are
in
consequence
just
a
wee
bit
spoiled
by
their
indulgent
parents
now
if
a
can
be
given
to
the
boys
and
the
tutor
i
advise
it
being
furnished
as
prettily
as
may
be
as
regards
the
walls
but
the
floor
must
not
have
a
carpet
and
room
must
be
found
there
for
the
lathe
tools
and
odds
and
ends
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
boy
and
here
let
me
beg
and
implore
parents
to
aid
and
abet
their
children
in
any
hobby
they
have
if
they
can
do
so
reasonably
and
comfortably
and
without
undue
expense
and
let
me
also
beg
of
them
to
keep
and
treat
with
scrupulous
reverence
any
drawings
efforts
of
literary
genius
or
of
mechanical
genius
which
their
children
produce
and
present
to
them
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
advise
their
being
exhibited
to
the
world
at
large
while
i
should
carefully
explain
to
children
that
the
thing
was
kept
not
because
of
its
present
intrinsic
merits
nor
because
it
was
a
distinct
effort
of
genius
but
because
it
was
their
doing
and
because
we
should
like
to
compare
it
with
future
efforts
in
order
that
we
may
see
how
they
have
improved
without
going
the
lengths
that
does
a
book
by
the
way
which
has
made
more
prigs
than
any
other
under
the
sun
in
my
belief
i
think
parents
often
make
their
children
miserable
without
in
the
least
meaning
to
do
so
by
reason
of
the
manner
in
which
they
refuse
to
interest
themselves
in
their
pursuits
it
is
not
pleasant
to
partake
of
sticky
black
cakes
baked
in
the
pans
to
sit
on
the
cold
stairs
in
the
dark
looking
on
at
a
spirited
representation
of
a
the
slides
of
which
we
know
by
heart
and
we
may
endure
agonies
over
the
hundredth
representation
of
the
usual
charade
neither
may
we
feel
profound
interest
in
the
school
magazine
but
at
the
same
time
we
are
bound
to
think
we
do
and
we
ought
to
be
more
than
thankful
that
our
children
care
for
these
things
and
go
in
for
them
rather
than
for
the
usual
hanging
about
reading
those
dreadful
rider
haggard
books
which
have
done
more
harm
than
anything
else
i
verily
believe
to
the
youth
of
the
present
day
and
have
vitiated
their
tastes
until
nothing
pleases
them
which
is
not
written
in
gore
and
bound
up
in
a
mixture
of
pistols
and
swords
which
is
as
odious
as
it
is
unnecessary
the
books
ought
to
form
a
very
distinct
feature
in
their
and
if
possible
we
should
endeavour
to
keep
out
all
haggardish
stories
but
this
is
almost
impossible
in
these
days
of
independence
and
literature
i
know
i
and
glorious
detective
stories
and
other
works
of
art
are
to
be
found
all
over
the
house
but
we
must
do
our
best
to
improve
the
standard
by
placing
other
better
books
in
the
authorised
bookcases
and
by
ridiculing
and
if
necessary
confiscating
whenever
we
can
all
we
so
highly
disapprove
of
at
the
same
time
i
honestly
confess
this
is
mere
advice
i
can
not
stem
the
torrent
myself
but
hope
there
are
other
more
parents
than
i
am
who
may
be
able
to
do
so
though
i
have
done
my
best
in
the
matter
and
have
tried
everything
i
can
think
of
to
eliminate
these
books
for
which
i
have
the
most
hearty
contempt
and
dislike
it
would
be
no
use
i
think
to
say
more
about
the
arrangement
of
the
room
which
should
be
set
apart
for
the
boys
but
i
can
not
say
too
much
about
the
necessity
of
the
dear
things
having
a
place
where
they
can
do
absolutely
what
they
like
for
half
the
friction
which
seems
to
me
inevitable
in
other
households
when
the
boys
are
at
home
is
undoubtedly
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
boys
are
in
the
way
and
have
no
place
that
they
can
call
their
own
under
these
circumstances
they
worry
their
sisters
spoil
the
furniture
and
upset
the
servants
and
more
especially
does
this
happen
in
london
where
there
is
nowhere
for
them
to
disport
themselves
and
nothing
that
they
can
do
except
promenade
the
streets
and
go
to
theatres
and
places
of
amusement
of
course
little
boys
can
be
managed
well
they
have
their
nurseries
first
and
then
their
governess
and
schoolrooms
it
is
when
they
begin
to
go
to
school
that
the
trouble
begins
the
governess
does
not
care
about
them
preparing
their
lessons
in
her
room
and
if
they
are
day
boarders
which
they
certainly
ought
to
be
until
they
are
twelve
or
thirteen
and
indeed
until
they
go
into
the
big
school
where
they
should
be
when
they
are
fourteen
and
not
a
day
before
the
lessons
must
be
prepared
at
home
and
this
work
should
doubtless
go
on
under
the
superintendence
of
someone
in
authority
parents
often
can
and
do
help
immensely
but
there
are
very
few
men
who
do
not
find
their
classics
decidedly
rusty
by
the
time
they
are
required
to
superintend
their
preparation
besides
which
they
are
as
a
rule
tired
with
their
own
work
and
are
not
in
the
least
inclined
for
extra
labour
and
often
do
not
possess
the
necessary
stock
of
patience
required
for
this
kind
of
employment
my
ideal
education
would
consist
of
sending
the
boys
to
a
good
school
in
the
daytime
and
in
taking
care
that
they
prepare
their
work
in
the
evening
under
a
good
tutor
who
would
be
trusted
to
simply
superintend
them
and
to
give
the
necessary
help
but
who
would
not
do
the
work
for
them
he
would
not
live
in
the
house
but
would
simply
come
for
the
couple
of
hours
during
which
the
boys
would
work
this
would
do
away
with
the
great
objection
to
home
education
which
is
undoubtedly
the
work
which
has
to
be
done
at
home
and
which
can
not
be
properly
superintended
unless
someone
is
told
off
for
the
purpose
unless
the
parents
are
well
up
in
the
work
of
the
day
and
are
furthermore
prepared
to
give
up
almost
all
society
for
the
sake
of
looking
after
the
boys
a
thing
which
should
never
be
done
for
it
is
most
important
that
we
should
make
and
keep
friends
if
we
care
for
them
for
ourselves
we
must
care
for
them
for
the
sake
of
the
children
who
would
find
themselves
shut
out
of
everything
when
they
grew
up
did
their
parents
withdraw
themselves
entirely
from
society
when
they
were
yet
small
of
course
a
great
many
people
can
not
manage
to
live
where
there
are
really
good
schools
but
equally
of
course
a
great
many
can
and
when
this
can
be
managed
it
undoubtedly
ought
to
be
and
places
like
bedford
where
the
schools
are
excellent
and
wimborne
where
the
grammar
school
has
improved
mightily
of
late
years
and
where
house
rent
is
moderately
cheap
and
living
very
inexpensive
offer
especial
advantages
to
a
widow
left
with
two
or
three
sons
to
educate
and
to
military
men
and
others
who
can
live
where
they
like
and
have
only
their
education
to
think
about
bedford
being
especially
good
for
this
purpose
i
believe
there
is
a
book
published
which
gives
all
necessary
particulars
about
all
these
schools
and
indeed
about
all
the
schools
all
over
england
but
i
shall
only
mention
those
of
which
i
have
personal
knowledge
as
i
am
no
believer
in
information
this
can
always
be
procured
for
special
cases
and
would
be
out
of
place
in
a
book
like
mine
but
i
do
strongly
advise
all
who
can
all
who
have
no
settled
occupation
that
binds
them
down
to
a
special
locality
to
live
where
they
can
have
their
children
educated
from
the
home
roof
i
am
quite
certain
that
this
is
the
ideal
and
proper
education
and
results
in
a
better
class
of
man
all
round
they
may
not
be
as
polished
their
manners
may
not
be
as
perfect
and
they
may
be
shy
and
gruff
but
their
morals
will
be
ever
so
much
better
and
they
will
be
better
men
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
for
though
they
may
the
maid
like
the
youth
in
at
all
events
they
will
marry
her
they
will
not
degrade
and
then
desert
her
as
alas
so
many
men
do
nowadays
but
i
myself
believe
they
would
do
anything
of
the
kind
by
far
and
away
the
best
men
i
know
are
those
who
have
been
least
away
from
home
and
they
are
not
among
the
unsuccessful
ones
of
this
life
either
however
it
is
sometimes
impossible
for
parents
to
manage
home
education
though
in
london
there
are
so
many
opportunities
that
it
must
be
more
a
case
of
must
than
for
there
are
westminster
and
the
university
college
schools
all
of
which
can
be
managed
after
the
boys
are
old
enough
to
be
trusted
in
the
streets
alone
and
at
the
latter
of
which
for
the
absurdly
low
fee
of
a
quarter
can
be
had
the
best
education
in
the
world
but
where
the
boys
need
learn
very
little
if
they
can
scrape
through
the
routine
without
finding
themselves
in
either
the
or
the
books
but
even
then
they
do
not
learn
as
little
as
they
can
if
they
try
at
either
eton
or
harrow
where
it
seems
to
me
the
education
given
is
especially
useless
for
practical
service
and
can
never
by
any
chance
fit
the
recipient
for
any
real
work
that
he
may
have
to
undertake
the
perfect
education
should
be
that
which
most
fits
a
man
for
his
work
and
no
one
can
watch
the
manner
in
which
we
are
being
ousted
by
germans
from
every
place
without
allowing
that
their
education
has
something
which
ours
lacks
and
that
unless
our
boys
can
be
taught
to
emulate
their
patience
perseverance
and
eager
quest
after
knowledge
to
say
nothing
of
their
capabilities
of
existing
on
a
pittance
we
shall
wake
up
some
day
to
find
our
lads
quite
out
of
the
running
because
they
do
not
understand
life
properly
and
because
they
are
unable
to
fight
for
themselves
against
the
present
overwhelming
german
invasion
there
is
a
limpness
a
passiveness
about
the
boys
of
the
present
day
that
is
something
dreadful
and
that
i
think
springs
in
some
measure
from
these
fatal
examinations
and
the
fearsome
higher
education
they
see
the
prizes
can
only
fall
to
the
exceptionally
gifted
and
members
of
the
fraternity
and
therefore
they
are
dispirited
before
they
start
knowing
that
try
as
they
may
they
can
never
succeed
far
from
stimulating
most
youths
to
work
the
sense
that
unless
they
are
geniuses
they
can
not
pass
the
exams
cripples
them
and
they
cease
to
care
to
try
for
what
they
know
they
can
not
possibly
obtain
read
how
they
may
and
therefore
i
can
not
but
think
the
excessively
high
standard
that
must
be
reached
nowadays
in
everything
is
a
mistake
and
that
serious
consideration
should
be
given
both
to
this
and
to
the
fact
that
our
boys
are
not
able
to
compete
with
the
germans
because
something
in
our
scheme
of
education
and
learning
does
not
permit
them
to
do
so
successfully
let
us
then
give
home
education
a
chance
and
see
what
can
come
of
that
and
let
our
nurses
be
french
and
german
so
that
the
children
may
learn
these
languages
with
their
earliest
breath
and
moreover
let
us
in
some
measure
educate
our
children
for
what
they
are
going
to
be
it
is
no
manner
of
use
to
give
those
who
are
to
be
in
trade
the
same
teaching
as
that
required
for
the
learned
professions
and
i
venture
to
state
that
if
a
man
has
to
take
to
trade
the
sooner
he
does
it
the
better
eighteen
ought
to
see
him
in
harness
of
a
light
kind
but
harness
all
the
same
and
i
furthermore
state
boldly
that
it
is
absolutely
waste
of
time
and
money
and
everything
else
to
send
boys
abroad
to
school
they
never
do
any
good
there
and
they
may
get
into
most
frightful
mischief
if
boys
must
be
sent
to
france
or
germany
take
them
yourselves
otherwise
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
both
time
and
money
are
wasted
i
am
not
speaking
without
book
and
i
have
never
heard
of
one
school
either
in
france
or
germany
where
the
education
was
of
the
least
use
neither
will
it
be
until
more
schools
follow
the
example
of
clifton
and
form
settlements
abroad
on
the
lines
of
our
public
schools
though
even
then
i
am
inclined
to
adhere
to
my
own
opinion
and
urge
on
parents
whose
sons
require
to
know
french
and
german
thoroughly
to
go
to
both
places
themselves
and
stay
a
couple
of
years
in
each
in
some
good
town
if
they
do
they
will
achieve
their
object
and
their
boys
will
command
far
higher
prices
in
the
labour
market
than
those
can
who
do
not
know
any
languages
except
their
own
and
a
certain
amount
of
latin
and
greek
which
it
seems
to
me
they
learn
only
to
forget
as
soon
as
ever
they
can
manage
to
do
so
but
if
parents
will
not
hear
of
home
education
they
must
most
carefully
select
the
preparatory
school
and
they
must
manage
to
afford
in
addition
a
public
school
for
nothing
can
possibly
be
worse
than
a
cheap
or
inferior
place
of
education
and
it
is
an
astonishing
fact
to
me
that
in
such
an
important
matter
as
is
education
one
requires
as
a
rule
so
little
guarantee
that
we
actually
receive
what
we
are
paying
for
no
one
can
be
a
lawyer
or
doctor
without
credentials
anyone
who
likes
can
open
a
school
and
command
scholars
too
why
should
not
the
state
interfere
here
it
is
very
fond
of
interfering
dreadfully
on
far
less
important
matters
and
say
boldly
that
no
one
shall
have
a
school
at
all
until
he
has
qualified
himself
in
the
eye
of
the
state
and
is
diplomaed
or
in
such
a
manner
that
one
can
tell
at
once
whether
he
is
fitted
for
the
work
or
not
until
this
is
done
i
much
fear
that
preparatory
schools
will
not
improve
to
any
great
extent
and
that
the
middle
classes
will
continue
to
send
their
children
to
people
who
are
utterly
unfit
for
the
work
they
have
undertaken
a
personal
reference
from
some
parent
often
enough
from
one
who
knows
little
indeed
about
his
children
and
possibly
a
few
letters
after
the
name
are
considered
quite
sufficient
guarantee
by
most
people
that
they
are
obtaining
all
that
they
are
paying
for
a
good
preparatory
school
costs
from
to
about
a
year
of
course
less
can
be
paid
and
i
dare
say
more
can
be
paid
also
but
i
consider
an
excellent
school
can
be
had
for
a
year
of
course
there
are
always
extras
beside
and
these
depend
entirely
on
the
means
of
the
parents
and
in
some
measure
on
the
schoolmaster
himself
who
should
undoubtedly
be
a
man
in
whom
we
can
trust
and
to
whom
we
can
give
our
confidence
telling
him
exactly
what
we
can
afford
to
spend
and
also
what
manner
of
child
our
special
boy
is
and
also
most
important
of
all
what
he
is
to
be
and
what
particular
talents
weaknesses
or
goodnesses
he
may
be
likely
to
inherit
we
should
also
give
our
child
our
confidence
we
should
tell
him
emphatically
what
we
can
afford
for
him
what
we
wish
him
to
do
and
finally
encourage
him
in
every
way
to
get
on
by
writing
to
or
seeing
him
constantly
and
by
never
letting
him
imagine
for
one
moment
that
of
sight
means
out
of
mind
he
is
more
in
our
minds
just
because
he
is
absent
from
us
than
he
would
be
were
he
constantly
in
our
presence
as
regards
public
schools
harrow

roughly
about
a
year
and
the
first

are
as

school
and
house
private
tuition
of
course
the
entrance
fees
do
not
come
in
again
but
this
is
more
than
spent
on
extras
there
are
subscriptions
to
endless
things
and
payments
for
extra
tuition
for
which
a
long
list
of
printed
names
on
the
first
account
in
some
measure
prepares
the
unhappy
parent
who
somehow
never
is
prepared
for
the
extraordinary
amount
of
new
clothes
mending
and
other
trifles
which
go
to
sum
up
the
accounts
in
the
ensuing
terms
eton

to
me
to

about
a
year
more
and
the

are
as

this

given
by
the
house
master
is
a
week
at
harrow
but
besides
this
of
course
the
boys
take
money
to
school
the
smaller
boys
at
harrow
should
not
have
more
than
during
the
term
and
out
of
this
they
must
pay
sundry
subscriptions
at
eton
i
think
the
can
be
almost
anything
while
at
rugby
does
until
the
boy
gets
into
the
sixth
when
he
should
have
more
money
and
when
the
books
a
heavy
item
in
most
school
bills
are
far
more
expensive
than
they
were
in
the
lower
forms
individually
i
know
most
of
harrow
as
i
said
before
but
as
these
bills
have
been
copied
from
actual
accounts
rendered
to
friends
of
my
own
i
think
i
am
justified
in
printing
them
and
they
will
also
serve
as
a
guide
to
those
parents
who
are
hesitating
where
to
put
down
their
names
a
ceremony
which
should
take
place
when
the
boys
are
about
six
or
seven
and
if
the
parents
have
no
and
are
not
wedded
to
any
special
school
by
reason
of
the
father
having
been
there
before
or
relations
on
either
side
having
been
in
the
special
school
the
school
should
be
chosen
in
some
measure
to
suit
the
health
and
also
in
some
measure
his
future
occupation
i
should
not
send
a
lad
who
was
going
to
work
in
any
shape
or
form
to
eton
that
school
should
be
reserved
for
those
useless
individuals
who
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
nor
should
i
send
a
boy
to
harrow
who
intended
to
go
in
for
trade
or
anything
save
one
of
the
learned
professions
those
who
have
a
big
business
to
go
into
might
be
sent
to
rugby
or
clifton
but
i
should
prefer
to
let
them
attend
or
the
london
university
school
or
else
send
them
to
bedford
or
a
similar
establishment
when
the
boys
are
at
school
the
holidays
should
be
in
some
measure
legislated
for
and
all
arrangements
made
for
the
welfare
and
of
course
no
parent
who
cared
for
his
or
her
children
would
possibly
be
away
from
home
or
out
of
reach
of
the
boys
during
that
time
the
holidays
which
are
as
important
in
some
measure
as
the
should
come
off
when
school
has
begun
again
but
on
no
account
should
they
occur
when
the
boys
are
at
home
and
if
possible
the
summer
holidays
should
be
spent
by
the
sea
the
beloved
sea
which
as
fashion
changes
is
i
am
sorry
to
say
becoming
unpopular
and
is
left
alone
by
those
who
are
fashion
led
and
in
consequence
impelled
towards
the
country
or
but
of
the
holidays
more
anon
i
have
not
yet
quite
done
with
the
boys
and
the
holidays
can
have
a
chapter
to
themselves
later
on
i
think
the
most
important
hint
of
all
which
i
have
to
give
is
that
on
no
account
should
a
boy
leave
school
or
college
until
we
have
something
to
put
him
into
and
which
shall
occupy
his
time
there
is
nothing
more
fatal
than
idleness
and
it
should
never
be
countenanced
in
any
shape
or
form
and
i
do
hope
some
day
to
find
that
all
boys
who
have
to
earn
their
living
may
be
given
some
sort
of
a
trade
something
they
can
do
with
their
fingers
outside
and
above
any
profession
they
may
be
going
in
for
given
a
trade
they
can
never
starve
and
would
be
far
more
fit
for
the
colonies
where
so
many
lads
flit
looking
forward
to
more
freedom
and
more
outdoor
life
than
they
can
possibly
have
here
in
england
though
i
can
not
imagine
a
more
foolish
thing
than
to
allow
a
youth
to
go
out
spec
unless
he
has
something
to
go
out
to
he
had
far
better
remain
where
he
is
if
not
he
will
soon
degenerate
into
something
far
less
like
a
gentleman
than
he
would
have
been
had
he
remained
at
home
and
taken
to
some
good
and
honest
trade
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
these
days
of
ours
will
open
up
the
furniture
business
to
gentlemen
and
that
soon
our
houses
will
be
provided
for
entirely
by
men
who
are
artists
and
that
those
who
can
not
originate
yet
have
artistic
tastes
and
an
eye
for
colour
will
not
despise
work
which
is
far
more
interesting
than
for
example
and
far
more
remunerative
than
the
position
of
clerk
with
which
so
many
lads
of
the
present
day
have
to
satisfy
themselves
the
gentlemen
of
england
can
bring
back
trade
to
england
if
they
choose
they
can
replace
the
slovenly
workman
and
the
shoddy
work
and
it
remains
to
be
proved
if
they
will
do
so
at
present
eyes
are
open
and
trade
is
no
longer
a
badge
of
disgrace
so
i
hope
some
day
to
see
industrial
villages
turning
out
good
work
where
at
present
are
empty
cottages
and
impecunious
landlords
with
untilled
farms
and
in
the
meantime
i
beg
our
boys
not
to
remain
idle
but
to
work
somehow
it
does
not
matter
much
at
what
but
at
some
work
that
will
be
good
and
must
and
will
find
a
market
if
a
lad
is
going
into
one
of
the
learned
professions
it
is
necessary
that
he
go
to
college
where
the
expenses
all
told
can
not
be
less
than
a
year
but
before
he
does
so
his
father
should
seriously
tell
him
that
whatever
allowance
he
has
is
the
extent
of
what
he
can
give
him
and
that
under
no
circumstances
whatever
will
he
be
responsible
for
any
debts
of
any
sort
or
kind
and
that
doing
what
he
is
for
him
he
is
doing
his
utmost
and
that
he
would
rather
see
him
go
through
the
bankruptcy
court
than
impoverish
his
sisters
or
his
other
brothers
to
pay
his
extravagant
liabilities
let
this
be
well
talked
over
at
home
in
private
and
i
do
not
think
the
lad
will
place
himself
in
the
miserable
and
anxious
position
of
many
a
young
man
who
ladens
himself
with
debt
during
his
college
life
which
cripples
all
the
best
of
his
existence
and
embitters
his
days
in
more
ways
than
one
but
the
boy
must
have
parents
on
whom
he
can
rely
and
he
must
know
that
they
mean
absolutely
what
they
say
there
can
be
nothing
more
unfair
than
for
the
girls
to
be
starved
mentally
and
morally
and
the
younger
lads
badly
educated
because
a
parent
has
to
pay
debts
which
ought
never
to
have
been
contracted
gambling
debts
should
be
utterly
ignored
by
the
parents
and
gambling
in
every
shape
and
form
should
be
absolutely
forbidden
the
reasons
thereof
being
plainly
stated
and
i
think
all
parents
should
be
more
open
about
their
circumstances
than
they
are
to
their
children
who
often
get
a
most
erroneous
impression
about
their
income
because
of
the
manner
in
which
they
live
why
because
they
have
a
carriage
and
a
big
house
is
the
very
reason
why
they
can
do
no
more
and
why
should
the
parents
give
up
all
they
have
justly
earned
because
their
children
are
extravagant
i
see
no
reason
myself
and
i
myself
would
certainly
never
do
so
to
pay
extravagant
liabilities
or
liabilities
incurred
on
the
or
on
the
racecourse
give
the
boys
a
good
education
and
a
start
in
life
and
provide
the
girls
with
a
year
either
when
they
marry
or
at
your
own
death
and
you
have
done
your
duty
by
your
children
the
girls
can
not
starve
on
that
income
and
neither
would
they
be
the
prey
of
any
but
no
one
has
a
right
to
bring
children
into
the
world
in
the
ranks
of
the
upper
and
do
less
misery
will
come
of
it
if
he
does
be
quite
sure
of
that
of
course
misfortunes
may
happen
and
the
early
death
may
prevent
an
actually
safe
future
being
secured
for
the
children
but
as
a
rule
an
early
death
should
be
provided
for
by
insurance
and
misfortunes
if
undeserved
generally
bring
sympathy
in
their
train
and
there
are
many
mitigations
even
for
these
if
parents
are
judicious
and
have
not
flooded
the
world
with
an
enormous
family
that
they
can
have
no
prospect
whatever
of
providing
for
as
soon
as
the
boys
have
finished
their
education
let
them
begin
to
work
a
lawyer
can
begin
a
doctor
can
commence
at
once
to
wait
for
patients
even
if
he
can
not
buy
a
practice
which
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
a
curacy
can
be
procured
for
a
cleric
and
if
trades
are
chosen
the
sooner
those
trades
are
entered
into
the
better
but
whatever
is
selected
never
allow
idleness
of
any
shape
or
form
idleness
is
the
parent
of
all
mischief
a
man
well
and
healthily
employed
has
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
go
very
far
wrong
let
the
boys
be
encouraged
to
have
tastes
and
above
all
let
every
lad
in
england
join
some
volunteer
corps
i
consider
it
a
duty
for
every
man
to
be
able
and
to
show
himself
willing
to
protect
his
home
and
if
he
is
encouraged
at
home
he
will
volunteer
and
will
take
an
interest
in
his
work
which
will
be
invaluable
to
him
the
expeditions
are
pleasant
all
lads
love
a
gun
and
adore
being
able
to
shoot
and
if
the
taste
is
acquired
in
the
school
cadet
corps
it
will
continue
afterwards
and
remember
that
all
sports
and
occupations
are
so
many
safeguards
tennis
bicycling
volunteering
shooting
hunting
riding
are
all
so
many
protections
against
temptations
to
which
all
lads
are
exposed
and
on
which
of
course
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
speak
here
to
sum
up
the
advice
i
would
give
about
our
boys
i
would
say
that
love
of
home
love
of
sport
not
racing
not
battue
nor
nor
similar
inanities
but
sport
and
love
of
an
life
are
the
great
protection
for
the
lads
do
not
encourage
and
endless
balls
and
society
affectations
but
do
encourage
in
every
way
you
can
those
things
of
which
i
have
been
writing
i
am
sure
then
we
shall
have
a
healthier
and
a
better
race
than
the
gaiety
for
whom
i
have
such
a
profound
contempt
or
than
the
betting
consuming
nerveless
brainless
idiot
that
is
so
extremely
prevalent
in
the
present
day
as
soon
as
a
lad
is
eighteen
he
ought
to
have
some
definite
allowance
for
all
his
small
expenses
and
to
enable
him
to
clothe
himself
and
this
must
depend
entirely
on
his
circumstances
and
where
he
is
and
what
he
is
doing
of
course
if
he
should
be
placed
in
his
business
he
must
be
paid
for
his
services
and
this
pay
must
cover
all
he
spends
but
as
a
rule
is
ample
a
man
can
dress
well
and
decently
on
the
other
he
can
do
what
he
likes
with
and
he
should
be
encouraged
to
save
for
a
holiday
in
he
had
far
better
travel
about
than
smoke
his
senses
away
or
waste
his
money
in
going
to
theatres
and
amusements
of
any
kind
boys
are
an
endless
anxiety
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
and
it
is
greatly
no
doubt
owing
to
that
fact
that
the
system
of
sending
the
boys
away
to
school
has
arisen
but
although
they
are
at
school
we
can
not
get
rid
of
our
responsibilities
neither
should
we
try
to
do
so
we
are
responsible
for
their
existence
and
we
are
bound
to
do
the
best
we
can
for
them
we
shall
i
am
sure
be
rewarded
for
all
they
have
cost
us
if
we
never
relax
our
care
until
they
are
really
grown
up
and
are
capable
of
managing
their
own
lives
then
if
we
have
trained
them
to
love
their
home
and
to
habits
of
work
and
occupation
we
can
do
no
more
but
trust
in
providence
we
shall
have
our
reward
sooner
or
later
of
that
i
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
as
soon
as
a
man
can
keep
a
wife
he
should
marry
and
begin
to
make
a
home
for
himself
i
am
a
great
believer
in
early
marriage
and
i
should
like
all
my
boys
to
marry
as
soon
as
ever
they
can
there
is
nothing
teaches
a
man
as
the
responsibility
of
marriage
does
and
nothing
on
earth
is
happier
than
a
happy
marriage
it
is
the
complement
of
life
the
perfect
whole
that
all
should
strive
to
attain
about
that
subject
i
am
quite
sure
and
none
of
the
stock
arguments
against
marriage
nor
the
stock
jeers
will
ever
alter
my
opinion
of
course
there
are
troubles
if
so
they
are
borne
better
together
pleasures
come
they
are
brightened
by
having
someone
to
share
them
and
above
all
marriage
makes
the
home
the
home
gives
an
object
in
life
and
steadies
at
once
therefore
marriage
should
be
encouraged
in
every
way
it
can
and
those
who
are
married
should
help
on
the
marriage
of
others
and
should
show
by
their
own
conduct
and
bearing
that
it
is
the
best
state
on
earth
if
undertaken
out
of
pure
love
not
silly
passion
and
maintained
in
the
mutual
respect
affection
and
toleration
for
each
faults
which
are
the
very
bonds
of
the
home
and
which
last
when
every
slighter
bond
has
given
and
fallen
away
once
our
boys
are
married
we
can
breathe
again
at
all
events
our
active
work
for
them
is
over
and
the
less
we
interfere
with
them
after
that
happy
event
the
better
chance
will
they
have
of
making
a
success
of
their
lives
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
win
the
love
and
confidence
of
their
wives
and
that
is
not
difficult
if
we
never
offer
advice
on
any
subject
and
give
them
as
much
affection
as
we
can
above
all
must
we
resist
the
dear
delight
of
talking
over
their
with
other
people
still
tongue
means
a
wise
head
says
the
proverb
and
a
tongue
can
not
possibly
be
too
still
when
once
there
are
sons
and
in
the
family
chapter
x
some
domestic
details
i
think
that
i
am
more
often
consulted
about
how
to
manage
servants
and
how
to
apportion
an
income
than
on
any
other
detail
of
domestic
management
and
therefore
i
am
of
opinion
that
a
few
more
words
on
these
subjects
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
although
as
i
have
repeatedly
stated
elsewhere
no
real
help
can
be
given
by
a
stranger
on
either
matter
and
that
only
a
species
of
general
rule
can
be
laid
down
either
about
the
management
of
the
maids
or
how
to
set
apart
and
divide
the
income
we
may
have
to
spend
to
begin
with
the
income
i
have
had
two
scales
drawn
up
by
an
accountant
and
now
present
them
here
for
what
they
are
worth
the
first
is
the
very
smallest
income
that
any
two
people
should
marry
upon
in
my
opinion
although
i
know
many
folks
especially
among
the
ranks
of
the
clerics
who
ought
to
know
much
better
who
continually
do
so
and
as
continually
have
numerous
families
for
which
they
can
not
provide
in
the
least
and
for
which
they
beg
in
the
most
shameless
manner
and
for
whom
i
have
neither
sympathy
nor
patience
as
a
rule
these
unfortunates
live
in
the
country
and
have
big
gardens
and
houses
found
them
rent
free
but
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
here
and
as
i
can
not
conceive
how
ladies
and
gentlemen
can
bring
up
clothe
and
feed
their
children
and
manage
their
household
respectably
on
less
than
a
year
i
have
no
ideas
on
the
subject
and
therefore
can
not
write
on
what
i
know
nothing
about
let
us
therefore
take
the
ordinary
young
lawyer
or
young
man
who
is
in
the
city
that
unknown
city
the
occupations
of
which
are
so
mysterious
in
my
eyes
and
let
us
suppose
he
has
to
spend
every
year
increasing
let
us
hope
should
he
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
a
family
a
luxury
he
has
no
more
right
to
go
in
for
on
a
tiny
income
than
he
would
have
to
set
up
a
carriage
and
pair
without
being
able
to
pay
all
the
concomitant
expenses
and
this
is
how
he
should
parcel

of

and
the
thousand
and
one
incidental
expenses
which
are
always
cropping
up
to
say
nothing
of
amusement
one
could
hardly
rise
to
the
upper
boxes
on
a
year
if
one
must
live
in
town
and
have
appearances
to
keep
up
as
well
it
is
better
at
first
if
the
income
is
very
small
to
live
in
the
suburbs
there
are
not
so
many
temptations
to
spend
money
and
there
would
not
be
much
going
out
in
london
of
course
the
going
out
is
endless
there
must
be
cabs
new
gloves
flowers
and
the
hundred
and
one
extras
that
carry
off
money
and
two
servants
are
a
quÃ¢
if
the
suburbs
are
selected
cabs
and
evening
gloves
need
not
be
legislated
for
one
servant
could
do
the
work
and
the
and
taxes
would
come
to
instead
of
but
there
would
be
the
to
consider
and
furthermore
the
intense
dulness
that
is
the
portion
for
suburban
residents
are
not
hospitable
they
are
most
of
them
not
very
well
off
for
of
course
all
rich
people
fly
to
london
they
are
mutually
suspicious
of
each
and
are
moreover
engrossed
as
a
rule
in
their
domestic
duties
and
when
the
husband
returns
from
town
he
is
not
only
tired
with
his
work
but
with
the
added
railway
journey
he
usually
hankers
after
his
garden
in
the
summer
and
his
by
the
fire
in
the
winter
and
does
not
care
to
go
out
more
especially
as
he
judges
from
his
own
feelings
in
the
matter
and
is
quite
sure
his
host
wishes
him
at
home
in
bed
quite
as
much
as
he
wishes
himself
there
but
again
here
i
must
show
how
impossible
it
is
for
another
person
to
really
advise
a
friend
on
this
subject
of
division
of
income
satisfactorily
there
are
plenty
of
suburban
residents
who
are
absolutely
satisfied
with
their
fate
and
are
equal
to
the
misfortune
of
a
small
income
in
that
case
i
have
told
them
precisely
how
they
can
manage
best
on
the
sum
of
a
year
i
can
assure
them
they
will
have
to
be
most
economical
and
excellent
managers
to
do
that
and
they
can
furthermore
understand
that
it
costs
about
a
year
to
add
a
child
to
the
establishment
and
that
a
year
is
supposed
to
keep
and
pay
a
servant
these
two
details
will
be
of
assistance
maybe
when
the
income
increases
and
the
owners
thereof
contemplate
a
little
launching
out
an
income
of
a
year
should
be
apportioned
as
follows
house
rates
and
taxes
repairs
renewals
two
servants
rather
better
wages
allowed
keep
of
self
and
wife
wine
clothes
and
for
wife
clothes
for
husband
coals
insurance
summer
outing
washing
balance
for
incidentals
and
this
larger
balance
would
be
drawn
upon
for
the
extra
expenses
such
as
entertaining
and
amusements
charities
and
the
thousand
and
one
pleasant
ways
of
spending
money
that
are
open
to
the
possessor
of
the
larger
income
and
are
rigorously
out
of
the
reach
of
the
owner
of
a
year
then
too
there
are
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
things
to
consider
before
laying
down
a
law
on
the
subject
of
apportioning
the
income
such
for
example
as
the
consideration
if
the
income
dies
with
the
husband
or
if
it
may
come
from
capital
safely
invested
in
the
former
case
the
insurance
ought
to
be
very
largely
increased
as
that
is
the
only
absolutely
safe
manner
of
saving
money
as
a
rule
it
costs
about
a
year
to
insure
the
receipt
of
at
death
if
the
insurer
is
a
young
man
and
i
ask
all
intending
bridegrooms
to
consider
what
this
would
mean
if
this
be
all
the
provision
they
can
make
for
their
brides
supposing
they
were
to
die
and
leave
them
with
two
or
three
little
children
and
no
other
means
they
could
not
live
on
a
year
which
is
about
all
they
would
receive
and
i
therefore
do
trust
all
young
men
will
seriously
consider
the
matter
before
rushing
into
matrimony
at
present
a
great
many
folk
are
like
the
ostrich
they
bury
their
heads
in
the
sands
of
present
content
and
never
consider
the
evil
days
that
are
before
them
if
they
remain
two
no
one
can
blame
them
but
i
do
blame
unendingly
the
selfish
creatures
who
burden
this
overcrowded
world
with
more
genteel
paupers
if
people
on
small
incomes
insist
on
doing
this
let
them
have
the
courage
to
bring
up
their
daughters
as
upper
servants
and
their
boys
to
good
honest
trades
it
is
the
genteel
pauper
the
girl
who
can
paint
a
little
teach
a
little
and
embroider
a
little
and
the
boy
who
come
what
may
must
wear
a
black
coat
or
its
equivalent
in
light
tweeds
who
have
no
right
to
be
made
to
exist
and
for
whom
the
world
has
absolutely
nothing
to
offer
save
a
certain
amount
of
snubs
and
a
very
large
quantity
of
the
unappetising
dish
known
as
the
cold
shoulder
therefore
if
the
income
dies
with
the
husband
and
there
are
children
a
certain
amount
of
money
must
be
put
aside
annually
for
insurance
it
ought
to
be
enough
to
bring
in
a
year
to
insure
the
wife
from
starvation
when
she
is
too
old
too
worn
with
all
she
has
had
to
do
to
attempt
to
keep
herself
and
there
should
also
be
no
false
pride
about
the
manner
in
which
the
children
are
educated
they
should
go
to
board
schools
where
the
teaching
is
excellent
and
far
better
than
one
can
procure
at
ordinary
small
schools
which
may
be
much
more
but
will
not
be
half
as
useful
for
the
board
schools
are
far
and
away
better
than
anything
that
could
be
obtained
from
the
wretchedly
underpaid
teachers
who
would
be
the
portion
the
necessary
companionship
with
wretchedly
poor
and
dirty
children
which
is
the
great
drawback
to
a
board
school
education
could
be
mitigated
if
all
those
who
are
really
worthy
of
the
board
school
education
were
to
share
it
and
surely
a
good
mother
could
tell
her
boys
exactly
what
to
avoid
and
the
lads
could
come
straight
home
and
simply
be
taught
in
the
school
the
girls
would
not
need
so
much
looking
after
for
they
are
far
more
conservative
naturally
than
boys
boys
will
play
with
and
talk
to
anyone
a
girl
very
soon
discriminates
for
herself
and
will
not
play
with
another
if
she
suspects
her
to
be
in
the
very
smallest
degree
below
her
in
the
social
scale
it
will
be
observed
that
i
do
not
in
the
least
take
a
sentimental
view
of
life
for
i
feel
that
when
one
contemplates
the
terrible
army
of
martyrs
the
girls
who
have
been
brought
up
and
are
starving
or
living
on
their
most
unwilling
and
relations
one
can
not
say
too
much
or
write
too
much
on
this
subject
and
i
can
not
also
but
think
that
when
there
is
the
cry
in
the
land
that
there
undoubtedly
is
for
more
servants
more
good
and
trustworthy
lassies
to
help
us
with
our
domestic
duties
and
that
when
ladies
in
australia
are
so
pressed
by
their
troubles
and
by
the
fact
that
they
can
not
get
for
love
or
money
that
they
are
actually
driven
to
write
to
their
papers
to
suggest
that
men
may
marry
more
wives
than
one
because
no
one
but
a
wife
is
found
to
do
house
work
and
that
one
wife
is
not
sufficient
for
the
purpose
it
is
quite
time
that
the
surplus
maidens
should
consider
whether
it
is
quite
as
impossible
to
become
a
servant
as
it
appears
to
be
now
as
decorators
governesses
and
spoilers
of
canvas
they
are
undoubtedly
not
wanted
but
they
are
required
badly
for
simple
domestic
work
which
is
none
of
it
half
as
hard
as
unlimited
tennis
dancing
all
night
or
rowing
not
any
of
it
half
as
unpleasant
as
is
living
on
the
begrudged
charity
of
some
relation
who
wants
all
his
savings
for
his
own
children
or
as
degrading
as
is
marrying
the
first
man
who
asks
them
and
who
can
give
them
some
sort
of
a
home
for
whom
they
have
not
the
smallest
respect
the
very
smallest
amount
of
affection
now
of
course
there
are
disagreeable
details
about
house
work
and
scrubbing
can
not
be
pleasant
but
surely
the
could
come
in
daily
and
do
up
the
worst
of
the
as
the
yankees
say
and
what
is
the
rest
waiting
at
table
not
half
as
unpleasant
as
selling
at
fancy
fairs
opening
and
answering
the
door
not
half
as
hateful
as
bringing
wretched
little
painted
and
tambourines
to
an
overstocked
guild
or
a
most
unsympathising
and
equally
overstocked
shopman
who
is
often
far
more
impertinent
than
any
caller
ever
could
be
to
the
lowest
maid
in
the
establishment
and
i
personally
should
prefer
to
make
beds
wash
china
dust
rooms
and
clean
silver
to
hanging
about
listlessly
in
a
shabby
frock
knowing
quite
well
that
i
could
never
have
another
unless
some
reluctant
relation
gave
me
one
she
would
much
rather
have
given
to
her
own
children
and
i
can
not
recollect
any
duties
which
would
be
expected
from
the
girls
which
i
have
not
enumerated
above
or
that
they
could
not
honestly
undertake
in
a
sheltered
home
and
under
proper
matronly
care
and
if
all
servants
were
ladies
and
i
see
no
reason
why
every
servant
should
not
be
a
lady
if
she
tries
think
how
much
more
our
houses
would
be
our
own
than
they
are
at
present
even
with
the
best
of
maids
there
are
always
places
in
it
and
corners
where
we
feel
we
can
not
go
exactly
when
and
where
we
like
and
where
try
as
we
will
we
can
not
be
absolutely
sure
that
thorough
cleanliness
prevails
and
where
moreover
we
can
not
be
because
all
our
efforts
are
frustrated
by
those
who
can
not
shake
off
their
early
training
and
can
no
more
refrain
from
smashing
china
and
scraping
paper
off
the
walls
than
they
can
learn
to
trust
us
implicitly
and
in
their
turn
allow
us
to
trust
them
remember
i
personally
never
can
nor
will
join
in
the
fearful
outcry
against
the
maids
which
i
hear
on
all
sides
of
me
i
have
related
my
own
experiences
in
vol
of
this
book
kitchen
to
and
i
have
not
one
word
to
add
or
take
from
what
i
have
said
there
i
still
maintain
if
you
take
your
servants
young
and
train
them
yourself
and
if
you
expect
perfection
and
show
that
you
mean
to
be
obeyed
you
will
have
no
trouble
but
you
will
never
have
perfect
service
until
you
can
have
ladies
in
your
house
whose
ladyhood
will
ensure
the
perfect
trustworthiness
the
honesty
the
cleanliness
that
no
girl
can
ever
give
because
she
can
never
be
taught
to
really
comprehend
the
necessity
of
all
these
particulars
scheme
of
lady
helps
has
i
believe
quite
collapsed
at
all
events
one
hears
nothing
about
it
now
but
i
see
no
reason
why
an
earnest
effort
should
not
be
made
to
try
sending
our
superfluous
girls
to
australia
as
lady
helps
and
then
if
that
succeeds
trying
them
in
england
where
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
real
and
crying
want
of
good
domestic
servants
i
am
only
judging
from
other
woes
for
although
i
dare
say
i
have
mine
before
me
i
have
not
experienced
them
yet
and
have
always
been
able
to
find
what
i
wanted
without
any
undue
exertion
on
my
part
of
course
the
house
would
have
to
be
reorganised
to
some
extent
the
bedrooms
would
have
to
be
as
fresh
and
pretty
as
one
could
make
them
and
above
all
we
must
reform
our
kitchens
which
are
at
present
the
most
unhealthy
disagreeable
and
odious
rooms
in
the
whole
house
as
they
are
undoubtedly
the
ugliest
and
where
in
ordinary
households
the
unfortunate
maids
have
winter
and
summer
to
sit
while
the
cooking
is
done
and
in
heat
that
i
wonder
allows
them
to
live
at
all
and
that
must
exasperate
their
tempers
as
much
as
it
must
try
their
constitutions
now
let
us
consider
the
ideal
house
and
the
ideal
kitchen
and
i
can
not
see
myself
why
both
should
not
exist
let
us
build
our
so
that
hot
and
cold
water
are
able
to
be
turned
into
the
basin
which
can
overtip
and
empty
itself
smaller
conveniences
could
be
managed
in
the
same
manner
and
all
the
housemaid
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
wipe
out
the
basins
daily
to
sweep
up
the
pieces
with
the
which
makes
no
dust
and
picks
up
every
morsel
off
the
floor
to
make
the
beds
and
dust
the
very
making
of
the
beds
being
simplified
by
the
chain
and
hair
mattresses
now
general
all
that
has
to
be
done
is
to
turn
the
mattress
daily
to
spread
the
under
blanket
and
sheet
absolutely
smoothly
over
it
and
tuck
them
in
to
replace
the
bolster
and
pillows
and
the
over
supply
of
blankets
carefully
straightened
and
tucked
in
is
that
harder
than
tennis
more
menial
forsooth
than
living
on
relations
or
genteelly
under
the
greatest
of
all
difficulties
the
difficulty
of
looking
nice
and
merry
and
being
on
absolutely
no
means
at
all
now
let
us
take
the
ideal
kitchen
the
kitchen
as
made
and
designed
by
faulkner
armitage
of
stamford
house
altrincham
cheshire
who
has
most
kindly
drawn
for
me
the
different
pieces
of
furniture
with
which
he
decorates
this
charming
room
of
his
and
which
in
the
manchester
exhibition
were
stained
green
and
decorated
with
brass
hinges
and
locks
and
see
how
we
could
adapt
this
to
our
present
style
of
house
the
house
with
the
tiny
kitchen
the
smaller
laundry
pantry
and
scullery
and
where
there
is
not
an
atom
of
apart
from
where
all
the
work
is
going
forward
in
that
case
is
it
worth
while
to
make
a
pretty
room
and
if
we
do
can
it
be
possibly
kept
so
i
think
it
can
even
with
our
present
maids
whose
taste
for
the
beautiful
is
not
largely
developed
it
most
certainly
could
if
we
are
given
the
maid
of
the
future
the
real
who
may
come
forward
to
the
rescue
of
those
unhappy
beings
who
at
present
haunt
the
precincts
of
registry
offices
and
spend
small
fortunes
on
advertisements
which
can
have
only
the
most
barren
results
but
before
i
go
on
to
speak
of
the
ideal
kitchen
and
the
cook
of
the
future
who
will
hardly
concern
my
readers
as
she
is
not
born
at
present
or
if
she
be
is
certainly
not
ready
for
engagement
i
should
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
best
manner
to
obtain
servants
repeating
continually
that
if
we
require
good
ones
we
must
take
them
ourselves
and
train
them
ourselves
i
am
always
met
when
i
state
this
fact
by
the
unanswerable
argument
have
neither
time
nor
patience
to
teach
my
servants
i
can
pay
good
wages
i
want
to
engage
skilled
skilled
labour
may
be
had
for
money
there
is
no
doubt
but
the
person
who
engages
her
maids
on
these
lines
will
never
have
good
or
affectionate
servants
she
will
be
waited
on
dressed
cooked
for
admirably
no
doubt
but
she
will
obtain
nothing
beyond
her
mere
bargain
for
better
wages
a
more
aristocratic
place
her
cook
will
leave
her
in
the
lurch
despite
the
fact
that
she
may
expect
to
be
laid
up
or
to
have
most
particular
and
important
visitors
at
the
very
period
when
the
old
maid
departs
and
the
new
one
comes
in
her
nurse
will
extract
her
pound
of
flesh
in
the
shape
of
holidays
and
outings
whether
the
baby
is
teething
or
not
or
whether
the
children
are
all
miserable
with
colds
or
she
herself
long
to
lie
down
with
a
bad
headache
the
housemaid
will
go
to
her
or
chapel
to
her
promenade
with
her
young
man
whether
she
has
unexpected
guests
or
not
and
she
will
never
know
the
extreme
bliss
and
comfort
of
possessing
friends
in
the
kitchen
who
give
up
their
own
holidays
because
they
are
sure
their
mistress
is
not
fit
to
be
left
who
regard
the
children
as
if
they
were
as
much
theirs
as
they
are
the
and
who
finally
think
of
her
and
hers
and
her
comfort
as
she
does
herself
no
mere
hired
help
will
do
all
this
you
must
have
maidens
whom
you
have
carefully
trained
you
must
take
trouble
aye
and
trouble
about
them
unless
you
wish
to
join
the
ranks
of
those
who
are
always
abusing
their
maids
and
yet
would
not
lift
their
fingers
to
assist
themselves
and
then
again
you
must
undoubtedly
train
yourself
at
the
same
time
not
to
expect
perfection
think
of
our
own
girls
are
they
always
to
be
trusted
at
tennis
and
at
balls
to
maintain
that
serene
and
demure
deportment
which
of
course
we
always
did
and
which
we
naturally
expect
from
our
daughters
especially
where
young
men
are
concerned
do
they
never
flirt
are
they
never
found
missing
at
critical
moments
for
example
when
the
carriage
is
at
the
door
and
paterfamilias
is
divided
between
anxiety
for
his
horses
and
wrath
at
being
kept
waiting
do
foolish
little
notes
never
pass
are
flowers
never
given
to
the
most
detrimental
youths
of
acquaintance
and
finally
do
our
own
daughters
always
keep
men
at
length
are
they
always
truthful
always
obliging
always
careful
about
their
own
rooms
and
the
things
which
are
committed
to
their
charge
i
leave
each
mother
to
answer
for
her
own
daughters
i
should
not
like
to
answer
for
all
the
girls
i
know
and
i
seem
to
remember
episodes
in
my
own
past
was
it
mine
or
did
it
belong
to
some
one
i
once
knew
very
well
indeed
i
wonder
which
i
should
rather
not
confide
to
my
daughter
and
indeed
which
i
should
not
care
to
hold
up
to
her
as
an
example
of
what
all
girls
should
do
and
which
often
make
me
very
kind
to
the
maids
when
i
meet
them
promenading
with
the
youth
who
calls
for
orders
or
the
man
whom
i
scarcely
recognise
out
of
his
livery
and
it
is
far
better
to
know
such
things
will
happen
and
to
keep
a
kindly
eye
over
these
affairs
than
to
scold
vigorously
and
declare
that
whatever
happens
no
followers
of
any
sort
or
kind
shall
enter
your
chaste
abode
neither
should
they
until
the
engagement
is
a
one
and
one
that
you
know
is
allowed
and
smiled
upon
by
the
parents
this
you
should
ascertain
for
yourself
another
reason
for
taking
your
maids
young
and
from
a
family
of
whose
antecedents
you
know
something
from
your
own
observation
and
i
never
think
much
harm
can
happen
from
these
promenades
if
great
stress
is
laid
upon
the
fact
that
all
must
be
at
home
after
dark
and
that
in
winter
no
one
must
stay
out
after
then
the
house
door
should
be
locked
and
the
key
brought
upstairs
either
in
town
or
country
there
is
always
the
front
door
to
come
to
and
there
is
no
reason
why
everyone
should
not
come
to
that
i
am
no
advocate
either
of
very
hard
and
fast
rules
and
i
maintain
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
make
and
still
more
difficult
to
keep
set
regulations
which
circumstances
may
alter
at
any
given
moment
the
only
thing
that
must
be
insisted
on
is
punctuality
without
punctuality
no
household
can
go
on
no
establishment
can
be
in
the
very
least
degree
managed
or
carried
on
the
servants
become
slovenly
and
it
is
impossible
to
get
through
the
work
because
no
one
knows
when
the
meals
are
to
be
or
when
the
beds
can
be
made
therefore
the
first
rule
and
indeed
the
only
really
important
rule
is
that
which
makes
the
meals
regular
and
the
attendance
thereat
compulsory
on
all
members
of
the
family
children
and
temporary
members
such
as
visitors
alike
after
that
and
when
we
have
demonstrated
how
the
work
is
to
be
done
we
should
stand
aside
and
not
interfere
unless
it
is
absolutely
necessary
then
a
few
quiet
words
are
enough
whatever
you
do
do
not
a
servant
that
requires
acrimonious
scolding
and
continual
had
better
go
and
another
should
be
had
at
once
the
best
way
to
find
a
servant
if
your
has
a
good
name
is
to
inquire
among
the
tradesmen
if
a
good
servant
is
leaving
her
place
she
always
tells
the
butcher
and
baker
she
never
goes
to
a
registry
office
if
she
is
leaving
to
better
herself
her
mistress
can
soon
find
her
a
place
among
her
own
friends
there
would
be
no
need
for
her
to
go
elsewhere
and
i
do
not
think
a
really
maid
ever
goes
anywhere
except
to
her
mistress
or
to
the
tradespeople
who
are
all
delighted
to
help
her
to
find
what
she
wants
an
advertisement
in
the
or
is
another
excellent
means
of
obtaining
a
recommended
servant
and
i
hope
some
day
to
find
that
the
wife
in
each
country
parish
will
turn
herself
into
an
amateur
registry
office
for
all
the
young
girls
under
her
charge
she
should
teach
them
in
the
kitchen
and
nursery
and
train
them
in
nice
ways
and
be
always
possessed
of
some
maiden
she
can
send
out
into
a
better
place
of
course
the
friendly
society
does
something
of
the
kind
but
the
good
that
it
does
is
largely
discounted
by
the
evil
ways
of
many
of
the
who
can
not
help
interfering
egregiously
and
stupidly
and
so
bringing
what
ought
to
be
an
absolutely
perfect
organisation
into
contempt
in
london
there
is
only
one
way
of
finding
good
servants
and
that
is
by
advertising
in
either
of
the
papers
i
have
suggested
saying
by
letter
only
or
else
the
advertiser
will
be
inundated
with
a
class
of
persons
who
apply
on
the
chance
of
picking
up
something
in
the
hall
or
of
getting
their
paid
no
unknown
person
should
ever
be
left
alone
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
and
on
no
consideration
should
anyone
pay
the
which
often
exist
in
the
imagination
only
and
would
be
amply
recouped
were
twopence
handed
over
to
the
applicant
to
cover
her
omnibus
fare
that
even
should
be
given
with
caution
for
absurd
as
it
may
sound
there
are
people
who
exist
on
applying
for
situations
which
they
accept
and
give
excellent
references
to
empty
houses
and
promise
to
come
in
at
once
to
commence
the
duties
required
immediately
the
mistress
overjoyed
at
the
idea
of
securing
such
a
treasure
gladly
pays
the
fare
to
some
country
station
to
be
refunded
of
course
out
of
the
first
salary
and
goes
off
for
the
character
when
she
promptly
discovers
she
has
been
done
and
that
if
such
a
house
does
exist
at
all
it
is
either
closed
entirely
or
lived
in
by
someone
who
has
never
heard
of
the
treasure
who
naturally
is
also
not
to
be
found
at
the
home
address
that
was
given
so
glibly
and
written
down
so
very
carefully
a
written
character
should
also
never
be
taken
the
most
exquisite
handwriting
the
best
of
all
duly
embellished
with
a
crest
address
and
monogram
complete
are
no
safeguard
for
servants
have
been
known
to
steal
and
in
these
days
of
universal
education
a
good
hand
is
not
to
be
trusted
in
the
least
even
if
the
family
with
whom
the
servant
lived
has
gone
abroad
and
this
is
the
favourite
reason
always
given
when
a
written
character
is
produced
there
must
be
some
relation
or
friend
of
the
last
employer
still
left
in
england
who
would
not
object
to
speak
for
a
maid
who
if
worth
anything
at
all
must
be
known
to
someone
outside
the
mere
inner
circle
of
the
house
itself
and
this
should
be
insisted
on
especially
in
london
where
an
unknown
servant
is
often
the
friend
of
the
gentle
burglar
and
can
do
an
immense
amount
of
mischief
indeed
when
i
thoroughly
sift
the
numerous
complaints
which
reach
me
about
servants
i
invariably
find
them
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
maid
has
either
been
procured
by
a
registry
office
or
taken
with
only
a
written
character
in
the
most
careless
way
and
with
not
half
the
precautions
we
should
take
before
we
engaged
ourselves
to
call
on
a
new
comer
to
our
especial
district
we
demand
very
strict
credentials
from
anyone
we
admit
to
our
house
as
a
mere
acquaintance
we
let
anyone
into
the
house
to
live
as
a
servant
who
can
produce
any
scrap
of
writing
or
procure
any
keeper
to
speak
for
her
capabilities
and
character
i
am
not
speaking
without
due
thought
on
the
matter
of
course
there
are
absolutely
trustworthy
registry
offices
and
some
written
characters
may
be
genuine
but
as
a
rule
neither
is
to
be
trusted
and
it
is
far
better
to
do
household
work
oneself
than
to
engage
someone
of
whom
we
know
no
more
than
can
be
told
us
by
an
individual
eager
for
the
hiring
fee
or
from
a
bit
of
paper
probably
written
on
by
the
applicant
herself
i
actually
know
a
case
where
the
mistress
had
to
go
into
the
neighbouring
town
to
search
for
a
cook
who
had
been
missing
for
hours
and
who
found
her
locked
up
in
the
police
court
for
drunkenness
and
riotous
behaviour
and
who
discharging
her
on
the
spot
was
surprised
to
find
the
woman
a
few
weeks
after
in
a
house
the
people
had
answered
for
her
character
although
the
first
mistress
had
taken
the
trouble
to
place
the
report
of
the
case
in
the
local
papers
in
the
hands
and
the
cook
was
in
possession
needless
to
remark
that
she
broke
out
again
and
is
no
doubt
carrying
on
her
practices
in
another
confiding
house
at
this
very
moment
a
written
character
introduced
a
butler
into
a
house
which
he
promptly
burned
to
the
ground
in
a
fit
of
blind
drunkenness
while
another
servant
in
another
house
was
found
in
the
act
of
carefully
concealing
a
burglarious
parent
in
a
convenient
cupboard
and
indeed
i
do
not
think
i
am
exaggerating
when
i
say
that
every
case
of
that
is
brought
under
my
notice
originates
in
either
of
these
two
particulars
and
that
if
due
care
aye
and
even
what
may
appear
as
care
is
taken
about
the
manner
in
which
a
servant
is
engaged
we
shall
soon
hear
far
fewer
complaints
than
we
do
at
present
while
by
raising
the
tone
of
our
maids
and
ensuring
that
only
really
servants
will
be
employed
we
shall
get
a
better
class
of
girl
to
take
to
service
and
we
shall
thin
the
ranks
of
unemployed
dressmakers
telegraph
clerks
and
and
shall
bring
them
back
to
the
sheltered
safe
untempted
lives
that
are
the
portions
of
all
those
who
are
in
good
places
under
the
care
of
conscientious
and
thoughtful
mistresses
i
think
many
writers
besant
for
example
have
done
great
harm
by
the
manner
in
which
domestic
service
has
been
run
down
and
when
i
am
called
on
to
pity
and
weep
over
the
case
of
the
sempstress
the
underpaid
unsettled
governess
the
miserable
who
can
not
sit
down
and
to
whom
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
internal
miseries
happen
because
of
her
hard
work
i
absolutely
refuse
to
do
so
there
are
plenty
of
good
sheltered
homes
waiting
for
these
girls
either
here
or
in
australia
where
they
can
be
fed
and
well
looked
after
where
they
have
every
comfort
and
where
they
are
as
absolutely
safe
as
if
they
were
in
a
palace
indeed
much
safer
as
maids
in
palaces
are
left
much
to
their
own
devices
and
can
get
into
as
much
mischief
as
they
please
and
there
is
therefore
no
reason
for
their
unhappiness
save
and
except
the
absurd
one
of
wishing
to
be
their
own
mistresses
i
want
my
freedom
i
would
rather
starve
than
be
obliged
to
brush
my
hair
neatly
to
give
up
my
drowned
ostrich
feather
my
screams
of
unbridled
laughter
in
the
streets
the
delicious
joy
of
trailing
up
and
down
a
road
and
in
fact
of
being
my
own
that
is
the
argument
put
into
the
mouth
of
the
factory
girl
only
of
course
in
not
quite
such
plain
language
and
much
applauded
now
if
so
ask
me
to
weep
over
the
girl
who
talks
like
this
because
i
shall
not
do
it
freedom
is
about
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
a
young
girl
she
requires
a
guiding
hand
as
indeed
in
my
opinion
all
women
require
one
all
through
their
lives
and
after
all
who
is
freer
and
less
trammelled
than
a
good
servant
in
a
good
place
she
has
no
anxieties
no
troubles
whatever
happens
her
wages
are
paid
to
the
day
and
her
food
is
unfailing
indeed
when
troubles
are
disporting
themselves
in
the
the
maids
seem
to
think
food
and
an
excellent
panacea
and
she
can
have
her
holidays
and
her
walks
too
whenever
they
can
be
managed
while
for
the
large
class
of
girl
who
becomes
or
rather
wants
to
become
a
nursery
governess
are
there
not
endless
other
situations
crying
out
for
them
where
as
upper
nurses
maids
or
good
cooks
they
could
be
sure
of
occupation
and
of
ending
their
days
in
comfort
having
been
able
to
save
which
they
could
never
have
done
on
the
a
year
of
the
ordinary
nursery
governess
who
does
all
the
mending
and
bathing
and
indeed
in
some
cases
much
more
of
it
than
falls
to
the
share
of
an
upper
nurse
who
yet
ranks
below
the
governess
because
she
is
a
servant
now
i
think
that
if
the
young
people
who
marry
on
about
a
year
and
can
only
afford
one
maid
would
try
this
plan
of
engaging
some
girl
who
can
not
get
a
situation
as
nursery
governess
and
work
together
with
her
they
would
be
far
more
comfortable
than
they
otherwise
would
be
all
their
things
are
new
and
pretty
the
bedroom
nice
the
kitchen
fresh
and
comfortable
a
young
bride
on
a
small
income
must
help
with
the
cooking
and
surely
this
would
be
much
more
pleasantly
carried
out
if
the
maid
were
in
some
measure
a
friend
i
can
assure
you
that
servants
i
know
have
far
better
claims
to
be
considered
of
a
good
family
than
dozens
of
girls
who
pitchfork
themselves
into
the
governess
ranks
and
consider
themselves
members
of
the
aristocracy
from
that
date
to
sum
up
then
our
case
if
we
require
a
comfortable
house
we
must
take
our
servants
young
and
train
them
ourselves
or
we
must
be
very
sure
that
the
servant
is
what
she
claims
to
be
and
that
the
character
she
is
provided
with
is
a
good
one
and
finally
we
must
endeavour
to
refill
the
ranks
of
upper
and
servants
from
the
overstocked
ones
of
nursery
governesses
and
unoccupied
girls
whose
parents
have
not
provided
for
them
and
who
are
unable
to
do
a
single
thing
by
which
they
can
in
any
measure
help
themselves
there
are
stupid
careless
and
even
unkind
mistresses
in
the
world
but
as
a
rule
servants
are
considered
and
very
kindly
dealt
with
and
there
can
be
no
reason
why
a
girl
should
refuse
a
sheltered
home
and
work
that
is
not
as
hard
as
many
other
kinds
of
labour
and
that
should
be
amusing
and
pleasant
in
a
small
household
or
even
in
a
large
one
where
the
housekeeper
is
a
lady
and
the
upper
servants
are
distinct
and
separate
a
nurse
of
course
having
her
own
rooms
and
being
waited
on
far
more
than
is
the
governess
who
after
all
in
the
eyes
of
the
domestics
is
neither
one
thing
nor
another
and
has
often
enough
to
go
without
or
see
after
her
own
comforts
but
until
that
halcyon
day
arrives
we
must
as
i
remarked
just
now
be
very
particular
about
the
references
and
we
ought
then
if
possible
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
her
mother
and
also
if
we
can
manage
it
of
the
clergyman
who
prepared
her
for
confirmation
of
course
this
means
trouble
yes
it
does
but
not
half
as
much
trouble
as
is
caused
in
the
endless
procession
of
new
servants
which
passes
through
so
many
houses
leaving
behind
it
traces
of
its
progress
in
the
shape
of
ruined
brooms
and
brushes
saucepans
smashed
crockery
and
bladeless
knives
all
of
which
must
be
replaced
as
one
goes
out
and
another
comes
in
in
a
manner
which
almost
ruins
the
unfortunate
master
and
enrages
the
mistress
proportionally
and
now
to
turn
to
the
question
of
how
to
make
the
kitchen
a
little
pleasanter
than
it
is
at
present
especially
in
those
houses
where
there
is
no
hall
the
best
of
cooks
only
succeeds
in
making
her
room
look
spotlessly
clean
and
absolutely
uninteresting
there
is
nothing
pretty
about
it
and
there
is
as
a
rule
nothing
save
the
ordinary
hard
windsor
chair
on
which
to
sit
this
is
quite
right
and
what
it
should
be
but
besides
that
there
could
be
an
easier
chair
for
the
tired
servant
who
presumably
can
get
quite
as
fatigued
as
we
can
and
for
whom
we
could
provide
a
chair
with
cushions
easily
taken
out
and
washed
once
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
is
illustration
fig
an
ideal
kitchen
likely
to
stay
with
us
and
that
she
is
to
be
trusted
not
to
make
hay
with
it
our
artist
has
made
a
sketch
of
ideal
from
faulkner
designs
which
i
hope
will
some
day
be
the
kitchen
of
the
future
here
the
dresser
and
arrangement
provide
for
all
the
necessary
pots
and
pans
while
the
furniture
is
as
simple
as
it
is
pretty
and
in
consequence
has
an
artistic
effect
which
is
really
charming
this
furniture
is
stained
malachite
green
or
russet
brown
whichever
is
preferred
with
the
green
furniture
the
tiled
paper
on
the
wall
which
is
much
nicer
to
live
with
than
mere
and
is
quite
as
clean
as
it
can
be
wiped
over
with
a
damp
duster
quite
easily
should
be
red
and
white
and
the
paint
a
dark
shade
of
red
with
the
brown
the
paper
should
be
blue
and
white
and
the
paint
a
good
blue
and
all
along
the
wall
on
the
floor
should
be
a
band
of
wood
this
keeps
the
chairs
away
from
the
wall
but
if
the
base
of
the
wall
becomes
shabby
a
dado
of
oilcloth
can
always
be
added
with
a
real
dado
rail
this
keeps
a
wall
tidy
for
years
and
can
always
be
washed
and
finally
painted
over
should
the
pattern
crack
or
become
in
any
measure
worn
and
untidy
the
ordinary
boarded
kitchen
should
be
covered
entirely
with
a
good
linoleum
and
a
square
of
carpet
lined
with
a
thin
american
cloth
should
be
given
to
the
cook
to
place
down
on
sundays
or
after
the
worst
of
the
work
is
over
this
gives
a
finished
and
furnished
look
to
the
room
and
adds
a
great
deal
to
the
comfort
of
the
maids
a
stone
floor
should
be
painted
with
ben
trovato
red
and
some
rugs
laid
down
at
all
times
as
this
is
very
bad
to
stand
upon
i
had
linoleum
laid
all
over
the
only
stone
floor
i
ever
possessed
and
that
answered
excellently
it
was
put
down
so
that
it
adhered
to
the
stone
in
some
manner
and
lasted
a
very
great
many
years
in
excellent
condition
but
should
anyone
object
to
this
i
can
also
recommend
a
square
of
matting
bound
all
round
with
a
wide
binding
but
this
should
be
rolled
back
for
cooking
as
grease
adheres
to
it
dreadfully
and
soon
makes
it
shabby
the
kitchen
windows
are
always
rather
a
trouble
to
arrange
as
generally
they
are
basement
windows
and
muslin
so
soon
gets
out
of
order
with
the
steam
and
general
mess
but
if
the
cook
takes
pride
in
her
windows
and
likes
to
wash
her
curtains
herself
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
not
have
the
same
kind
of
white
curtains
that
there
are
in
the
bedrooms
but
let
all
come
from
the
top
of
the
window
being
dreadful
and
looking
worse
in
my
opinion
than
no
blinds
at
all
in
windows
on
a
level
with
the
garden
or
street
one
must
have
obscured
glass
either
cathedral
or
ribbed
glass
this
of
course
is
rather
hard
on
the
maids
who
are
not
thus
able
to
look
out
but
it
can
not
be
helped
it
is
impossible
for
the
kitchen
to
be
so
much
in
evidence
as
it
otherwise
would
be
and
no
muslin
is
as
effective
a
screen
as
the
obscured
glass
is
there
should
always
be
inside
bars
and
shutters
to
any
basement
or
windows
and
nothing
should
be
kept
downstairs
which
can
possibly
or
in
any
way
tempt
the
prowling
burglar
all
silver
should
be
taken
upstairs
to
the
room
and
there
should
be
a
small
dog
loose
downstairs
a
dog
frightens
a
thief
dreadfully
as
he
is
quite
as
much
afraid
of
his
bark
as
ever
he
is
of
his
bite
the
basement
in
a
london
house
is
often
a
dreadful
possession
as
there
are
so
many
places
where
a
thief
could
conceal
himself
in
the
daytime
no
doors
then
should
ever
be
left
unbolted
and
the
master
should
furthermore
make
a
practice
of
going
round
the
very
last
thing
at
night
to
see
that
all
is
safe
or
else
there
can
be
no
security
at
all
sometimes
the
servants
may
descend
again
and
hold
unholy
revels
sometimes
an
open
or
unguarded
door
leaves
access
to
the
place
and
an
unexpected
visit
from
a
tramp
may
alarm
us
as
much
as
would
a
professional
visit
from
a
burglar
we
can
not
impress
this
on
our
servants
too
often
and
we
impress
it
on
them
a
thousand
times
more
forcibly
than
we
otherwise
should
when
they
see
our
nightly
patrol
and
know
we
have
supplemented
their
bolts
with
a
visit
of
inspection
then
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
should
be
bolted
barred
and
locked
and
the
key
removed
this
should
be
given
into
the
care
of
the
butler
if
there
be
one
or
into
the
safe
keeping
of
the
cook
and
we
may
retire
to
rest
feeling
safe
that
even
if
the
tramp
comes
or
the
thief
is
in
hiding
below
he
will
remain
in
the
lower
regions
and
can
do
nothing
worse
than
have
a
feast
in
the
larder
or
break
a
few
panes
of
glass
in
his
efforts
to
escape
it
will
seem
to
my
readers
that
one
has
to
take
endless
trouble
to
see
perpetually
about
endless
trifles
as
long
as
we
are
householders
and
have
the
management
of
a
family
on
our
hands
yet
once
started
on
good
lines
and
matters
are
not
so
difficult
as
they
appear
still
of
course
no
life
of
great
responsibility
indeed
no
life
at
all
can
ever
be
entirely
happy
and
entirely
easy
those
who
have
least
to
do
become
bored
and
tired
by
mere
inactivity
those
who
have
most
wearing
out
instead
of
rusting
out
all
comes
to
an
end
some
day
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
strive
as
we
may
death
waits
for
us
all
and
our
carefully
trained
household
falls
apart
and
drifts
away
our
furniture
wears
out
our
carefully
amassed
hoards
are
turned
over
and
parted
among
our
successors
some
one
else
takes
our
house
and
obliterates
with
his
personality
the
last
traces
of
ours
and
if
we
have
refused
to
do
our
work
or
let
things
slide
we
shall
speedily
be
forgotten
but
if
we
have
honestly
done
our
work
what
of
it
our
maids
carry
on
our
good
lessons
elsewhere
our
hoards
make
someone
else
happy
and
the
example
we
have
set
bears
fruit
a
hundredfold
and
someone
is
always
happier
some
household
better
for
the
work
we
have
done
no
matter
then
if
we
have
fallen
out
of
the
ranks
tired
out
we
have
done
our
work
and
so
can
retire
gracefully
being
quite
sure
that
none
of
our
trouble
is
wasted
and
that
not
one
of
us
has
toiled
in
vain
and
i
maintain
that
we
can
not
ever
take
too
much
trouble
about
our
homes
that
we
can
not
have
them
too
pretty
or
too
well
managed
and
that
moreover
once
they
are
started
they
are
easy
to
keep
going
always
supposing
that
we
have
regular
ways
and
rules
that
we
do
not
muddle
and
that
we
pass
over
nothing
that
requires
attention
let
it
be
a
braid
off
a
chair
or
the
misdemeanour
or
disobedience
of
a
servant
or
child
the
one
should
be
mended
the
other
spoken
to
at
once
then
things
will
go
on
like
clockwork
and
we
shall
be
fairly
astonished
to
find
how
well
things
progress
and
how
admirably
they
manage
themselves
start
well
start
carefully
and
then
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
steer
straight
after
all
steering
is
not
very
hard
work
and
that
is
all
one
has
to
do
once
the
ship
is
fairly
loaded
and
under
way
chapter
xi
the
sick
room
in
all
large
houses
there
ought
undoubtedly
to
be
some
provision
for
infectious
illness
of
course
i
know
that
there
are
excellent
fever
hospitals
where
one
can
be
despatched
at
almost
a
notice
where
an
ambulance
will
deposit
you
and
where
the
best
nursing
and
doctoring
can
be
had
at
a
most
moderate
outlay
and
i
for
one
highly
applaud
those
courageous
souls
who
telegraph
for
the
proper
conveyance
and
depart
cutting
themselves
off
from
their
homes
and
at
the
same
time
from
any
chance
of
handing
on
their
complaints
elsewhere
with
one
fell
swoop
but
much
as
i
admire
and
applaud
nothing
would
i
fear
induce
me
to
follow
their
laudable
example
to
know
how
to
be
ill
is
a
fine
art
and
this
accomplishment
is
quite
thrown
away
on
those
who
regard
one
merely
as
a
and
talk
about
one
as
if
one
were
a
mere
chattel
left
with
them
to
repair
and
return
with
the
utmost
speed
moreover
i
maintain
always
that
bodily
health
depends
immensely
on
surroundings
and
that
it
would
take
double
the
time
to
get
better
in
a
hospital
than
one
would
in
own
home
where
one
could
see
friends
out
of
the
window
and
catch
even
a
whisper
of
what
was
happening
and
see
even
from
the
greatest
distance
some
of
old
accustomed
sights
in
an
ordinary
house
as
at
present
arranged
it
would
be
absolutely
impossible
to
have
even
the
smallest
amount
of
infectious
disease
without
running
the
greatest
risk
of
handing
it
on
to
all
the
rest
of
the
family
but
there
could
be
in
most
houses
such
arrangements
made
were
the
builder
a
man
of
sense
that
we
could
have
a
hospital
room
a
room
sufficiently
isolated
to
ensure
immunity
from
infection
and
yet
near
enough
to
do
away
with
the
hopeless
feeling
which
seizes
the
ordinary
mortal
the
moment
he
hears
he
has
catching
and
which
enables
him
to
understand
what
were
the
feelings
of
the
lepers
of
old
who
had
to
flee
from
the
sight
of
their
calling
out
aloud
as
they
ran
unclean
of
course
we
ought
not
to
feel
angry
with
those
who
refuse
to
come
near
us
indeed
had
i
my
way
no
one
should
ever
enter
a
house
where
there
was
scarlatina
or
diphtheria
but
we
do
resent
it
somehow
despite
our
own
common
sense
and
the
knowledge
that
we
should
forbid
the
call
our
friends
are
so
anxious
not
to
make
if
they
attempted
to
come
near
us
and
there
is
no
more
miserable
feeling
than
that
which
seizes
us
when
we
are
told
that
we
have
a
complaint
in
our
midst
which
may
prevent
us
from
being
on
the
same
footing
as
the
rest
of
mankind
for
several
weary
weeks
or
may
be
months
but
before
going
into
the
matter
of
what
we
should
do
when
infection
is
in
our
house
let
me
for
a
moment
speak
about
the
room
we
should
all
of
us
possess
ready
for
an
emergency
and
into
which
we
could
retire
were
we
ill
at
all
not
only
but
ill
in
such
a
way
that
we
may
require
careful
nursing
many
fires
and
absolute
quiet
and
rest
we
should
select
a
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
unless
we
are
building
our
house
in
that
case
we
should
have
a
couple
of
rooms
added
on
at
one
end
with
a
bathroom
lavatory
and
tiny
kitchen
range
in
a
third
room
this
should
make
a
sort
of
annexe
to
the
house
it
should
be
reached
from
outside
and
a
passage
closed
at
one
end
with
a
door
should
communicate
with
the
rest
of
the
house
i
once
knew
such
an
arrangement
as
this
and
have
always
hankered
after
it
more
especially
as
it
allowed
one
member
of
a
family
of
eight
children
to
have
scarlet
fever
at
home
without
in
the
least
endangering
the
lives
of
any
others
of
the
family
while
the
mother
could
see
the
child
daily
through
the
door
although
she
could
not
nurse
her
herself
she
ran
absolutely
no
risk
the
door
was
as
safe
as
the
solid
wall
and
over
it
always
hung
a
sheet
steeped
in
carbolic
acid
the
child
was
nursed
among
familiar
surroundings
the
doctor
could
visit
it
without
passing
through
the
house
all
the
food
could
be
placed
so
that
the
nurse
received
it
without
the
smallest
risk
and
in
fact
the
arrangement
was
so
absolutely
perfect
that
i
can
not
understand
why
possessors
of
large
houses
and
good
means
do
not
always
keep
some
rooms
of
the
kind
ready
no
family
can
go
through
life
without
illness
it
is
much
easier
to
bear
when
all
is
prepared
for
it
and
there
is
no
dreadful
domestic
upset
to
add
to
our
natural
anxiety
and
trouble
when
illness
comes
upon
us
all
now
given
such
houses
as
these
or
even
the
single
room
quite
at
the
top
of
the
house
which
would
be
next
best
and
although
these
have
their
disadvantages
they
are
generally
quieter
than
any
other
i
should
proceed
to
decorate
them
prettily
i
should
paint
the
walls
first
and
then
i
should
paper
them
with
the
very
cheapest
blue
paper
i
could
find
i
think
blue
and
white
paper
would
be
best
and
i
should
have
ivory
paint
the
a
piece
white
and
yellow
ceiling
paper
and
curtains
of
a
yard
serge
in
art
blue
double
there
is
nothing
here
which
can
not
be
replaced
at
a
very
small
cost
yet
everything
would
look
pretty
and
bright
and
fresh
and
i
should
have
the
floor
parqueterie
or
else
covered
with
matting
and
rugs
the
rugs
could
be
removed
in
a
moment
if
anything
infectious
were
the
matter
while
the
matting
could
be
disinfected
or
destroyed
but
this
should
remain
it
smells
fresh
it
never
accumulates
the
dust
and
always
looks
nice
in
my
opinion
in
illness
looks
are
everything
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
things
to
be
neat
and
pretty
else
the
patient
will
be
worried
to
death
without
really
understanding
why
he
is
being
worried
the
bed
should
be
a
good
wide
one
a
double
one
this
gives
room
for
the
patient
to
move
about
in
it
should
have
a
wire
mattress
and
a
good
hair
mattress
at
the
top
four
pillows
and
a
bolster
and
it
should
have
an
ample
supply
of
venerable
blankets
for
under
use
those
for
over
use
should
depend
on
what
is
the
matter
new
blankets
and
an
are
lighter
and
warmer
than
anything
and
if
these
are
required
they
must
be
had
even
if
afterwards
they
have
to
be
destroyed
there
should
be
no
washing
or
dressing
apparatus
visible
these
can
be
kept
in
the
lavatory
but
there
should
be
two
or
three
of
the
stained
wooden
chairs
sold
by
pither
mortimer
street
which
are
comfortable
enough
for
the
doctor
and
an
occasional
visitor
or
for
the
nurse
on
duty
too
much
comfort
often
induces
sleep
and
which
can
be
wiped
over
daily
there
should
also
be
a
wide
deep
wicker
armchair
nicely
cushioned
and
there
should
be
a
long
chair
for
the
invalid
where
he
or
she
could
rest
while
the
bed
is
made
or
remain
when
convalescence
has
begun
and
the
bed
may
be
left
for
some
hours
at
least
the
long
deck
chairs
are
not
suitable
for
this
purpose
as
being
made
of
wicker
they
creak
in
the
most
awful
manner
and
are
not
comfortable
in
the
least
but
there
are
some
long
narrow
beds
used
as
camp
beds
which
can
be
put
up
at
any
angle
and
have
an
iron
frame
filled
in
with
sacking
on
which
a
cushion
is
placed
this
makes
the
most
comfortable
lounge
of
which
i
know
and
should
be
in
every
sick
room
or
room
set
apart
for
the
purpose
of
nursing
they
can
be
bought
at
almost
any
or
at
any
place
which
caters
for
volunteers
or
those
who
do
any
luxurious
camping
out
there
should
be
pictures
on
the
walls
and
a
bookcase
and
above
all
there
should
be
a
screen
of
some
kind
or
other
the
pictures
should
be
of
the
cheapest
some
of
those
lately
issued
by
the
people
which
resemble
old
bartolozzi
prints
would
do
admirably
as
the
frames
could
be
disinfected
the
glass
washed
and
the
pictures
themselves
destroyed
the
bookcase
could
be
varnished
or
and
the
books
burned
books
are
fearful
methods
of
conveying
infection
and
carelessness
about
this
can
not
be
too
harshly
condemned
it
is
far
better
to
destroy
everything
no
matter
how
precious
it
may
be
than
run
the
very
smallest
risk
of
passing
on
even
what
may
be
considered
a
mild
complaint
for
that
which
is
mild
in
one
patient
often
causes
death
or
great
suffering
in
another
whose
constitution
is
unfitted
to
cope
with
that
special
disease
once
the
room
is
ready
and
looking
pretty
the
next
care
must
be
to
see
that
it
is
kept
properly
aired
and
that
nothing
gets
out
of
order
and
that
all
the
things
for
use
are
in
their
places
then
we
need
not
think
any
more
about
the
room
which
should
be
under
the
charge
of
the
of
the
establishment
but
especially
where
there
are
children
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
we
should
be
prepared
for
emergencies
and
know
exactly
what
to
do
should
there
be
any
necessity
for
prompt
action
there
are
a
series
of
rules
printed
by
the
national
health
society
which
should
be
hung
up
in
every
nursery
and
there
should
be
moreover
a
box
containing
simple
remedies
for
sprains
arnica
cuts
calendula
and
burns
oiled
silk
oil
and
cotton
wool
and
the
nurse
should
keep
the
key
but
whatever
happens
her
remedies
can
only
be
temporary
ones
all
her
instructions
should
end
like
those
to
the
ambulance
experts
for
the
now
although
i
am
certainly
no
advocate
for
constantly
sending
for
the
doctor
and
though
i
maintain
that
for
small
children
a
good
nurse
is
worth
all
the
doctors
under
the
sun
i
do
maintain
that
immense
comfort
and
safety
are
procured
by
an
early
visit
from
the
doctor
if
we
are
fearful
that
anything
is
wrong
above
the
common
but
i
maintain
equally
strongly
that
to
be
able
to
do
this
we
must
be
very
sure
of
our
man
we
must
be
able
to
trust
him
and
we
must
be
quite
certain
that
he
is
an
honest
man
who
will
not
trespass
on
our
credulity
or
fatten
on
our
fears
and
who
will
have
the
necessary
courage
to
tell
us
straight
out
that
we
have
nothing
to
fear
and
that
we
need
not
send
for
him
again
or
at
least
that
he
will
not
come
again
until
we
do
send
for
him
above
all
let
us
if
possible
keep
to
the
same
doctor
nothing
is
more
stupid
than
to
change
him
unless
we
are
absolutely
obliged
to
do
so
for
he
understands
his
constitutions
if
he
has
always
had
to
see
after
them
a
new
man
can
not
possibly
do
so
at
first
and
much
more
depends
on
a
doctor
understanding
what
he
has
to
deal
with
as
far
as
heredity
is
concerned
than
one
quite
comprehends
people
would
not
be
quite
so
ready
to
change
their
medical
attendant
as
they
very
often
seem
to
me
to
be
if
they
thoroughly
believed
in
this
and
now
comes
the
great
subject
of
nursing
i
was
much
amused
the
other
day
to
see
an
indignant
article
from
someone
who
abused
the
present
generation
of
mothers
because
they
did
not
nurse
their
children
themselves
in
cases
of
infection
and
because
their
first
idea
in
an
emergency
was
to
send
for
a
nurse
now
i
maintain
that
that
is
the
very
wisest
thing
anyone
can
do
a
mother
as
a
rule
is
the
worst
person
in
the
world
to
nurse
her
own
child
her
fearful
anxiety
makes
her
nervous
and
communicates
itself
to
the
patient
who
ought
never
to
know
that
anyone
is
the
least
anxious
about
him
her
face
betrays
her
and
her
shaking
hands
play
her
false
and
on
a
thousand
grounds
it
is
far
better
to
have
a
trained
nurse
than
to
trust
to
unskilled
though
loving
nursing
a
mother
may
never
have
had
the
smallest
experience
of
nursing
until
she
is
called
upon
to
exercise
any
little
talent
she
may
have
for
it
on
behalf
of
her
nearest
and
dearest
she
becomes
frantically
miserable
at
symptoms
a
nurse
understands
and
are
often
enough
symptoms
for
good
she
can
not
raise
a
patient
and
give
him
food
comfortably
as
does
a
woman
trained
to
the
work
and
she
can
not
be
the
all
nurses
ought
undoubtedly
to
be
and
indeed
are
nowadays
unless
she
has
had
training
a
course
of
training
by
the
way
which
would
be
most
distasteful
to
many
and
absolutely
impossible
to
the
few
a
nurse
is
born
not
made
of
that
i
am
absolutely
convinced
from
my
own
experience
i
do
not
think
anything
would
make
me
personally
fit
to
nurse
anyone
much
as
i
should
like
to
do
it
were
i
called
upon
to
turn
nurse
i
could
undoubtedly
keep
a
room
neat
smooth
a
pillow
and
fold
a
sheet
over
properly
but
i
stand
by
in
amaze
and
watch
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
never
been
trained
but
is
a
born
nurse
who
knows
exactly
how
to
lift
her
patient
when
and
how
to
give
and
medicine
and
who
does
easily
and
without
effort
what
i
can
not
do
at
all
try
as
hard
as
i
may
to
follow
her
excellent
example
she
may
be
anxious
she
never
shows
it
in
the
least
she
may
be
tired
to
death
she
does
not
look
it
her
voice
is
always
at
the
right
pitch
and
though
she
naturally
is
not
merry
when
there
is
danger
she
maintains
an
even
cheerfulness
which
is
delightful
and
as
restful
to
the
patient
as
it
is
most
undoubtedly
restful
and
reassuring
to
the
friends
now
sentiment
apart
and
sentiment
should
never
be
considered
in
the
very
least
degree
where
real
work
has
to
be
done
surely
my
friend
is
better
able
to
nurse
and
a
much
safer
nurse
than
i
should
be
i
who
have
honestly
and
seriously
tried
to
overcome
my
stupidity
and
dread
of
sick
people
and
who
visited
at
a
hospital
regularly
until
i
was
utterly
and
completely
routed
by
seeing
a
man
in
a
fit
since
when
i
have
avoided
hospitals
and
have
quite
come
to
the
conclusion
i
should
never
be
a
nurse
therefore
is
it
not
wiser
for
people
in
real
cases
of
dangerous
illness
to
engage
women
who
understand
their
work
i
am
convinced
it
is
and
strongly
recommend
anyone
who
is
advised
by
the
doctor
to
send
for
a
nurse
to
do
so
he
will
always
be
able
to
tell
them
where
to
send
if
not
they
can
find
any
amount
of
addresses
in
that
most
useful
and
excellent
little
book
dictionary
of
but
the
doctor
should
find
the
nurse
in
infectious
cases
for
as
a
rule
he
knows
someone
with
whom
he
has
worked
already
and
of
course
these
nurses
have
to
be
sent
for
in
a
hurry
one
does
not
make
preparations
for
and
look
out
for
fevers
as
one
does
when
a
small
baby
is
expected
about
that
i
have
said
all
i
have
to
say
in
my
other
book
and
shall
not
therefore
say
anything
here
on
that
absorbing
subject
everybody
should
remember
that
illness
instead
of
deadening
our
faculties
undoubtedly
and
at
once
heightens
every
one
we
possess
we
see
more
acutely
most
certainly
our
smell
and
taste
are
exaggerated
in
the
most
painful
degree
and
little
annoyances
and
inferior
cooking
which
we
scarcely
notice
or
indeed
notice
not
at
all
when
we
are
well
try
us
most
dreadfully
if
we
are
to
eat
at
all
all
must
be
absolutely
clean
and
free
from
grease
and
sent
up
spotlessly
there
must
not
be
a
suspicion
of
carelessness
or
inevitably
we
shall
turn
against
the
food
and
send
it
down
untouched
likewise
creaking
shoes
rustling
paper
banging
doors
crooked
pictures
dusty
tables
and
chairs
must
not
exist
where
there
are
invalids
and
above
all
i
am
convinced
that
until
a
person
is
actually
and
positively
dead
no
one
should
talk
about
them
over
their
bodies
thinking
they
are
insensible
i
am
certain
that
insensible
people
so
called
are
often
far
more
sensitive
than
either
doctor
or
nurse
will
allow
and
i
know
i
myself
have
often
heard
things
which
were
never
meant
for
me
to
hear
when
people
have
thought
me
asleep
but
when
i
have
really
simply
been
too
tired
to
open
my
eyes
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
expression
that
flitted
across
the
face
of
a
dear
old
lady
who
was
absolutely
dying
who
had
not
swallowed
for
two
days
or
spoken
for
a
great
many
more
when
her
daughter
and
maid
spoke
of
the
mourning
and
funeral
by
her
bedside
heartlessly
she
heard
and
understood
although
she
undoubtedly
had
no
power
of
letting
us
know
that
she
did
so
and
i
moreover
have
been
told
by
a
cousin
whose
recovery
from
a
frightful
attack
of
was
miraculous
and
who
most
certainly
was
merely
saved
from
death
by
her
unremitting
care
and
the
excellent
nursing
she
received
from
him
he
never
left
her
once
for
over
hours
that
she
knew
absolutely
everything
that
went
on
that
she
heard
every
single
word
and
whisper
and
that
she
most
certainly
would
never
say
a
word
in
the
presence
of
any
person
that
could
pain
or
agitate
him
in
the
least
for
when
she
appeared
most
insensible
to
she
was
really
far
more
sensitive
than
she
had
ever
been
in
all
her
life
her
hearing
was
absolutely
acute
and
every
sense
seemed
on
end
a
feeling
i
can
corroborate
from
my
own
experience
though
i
have
had
no
really
very
serious
illness
but
have
been
ill
enough
to
comprehend
this
supersensitiveness
and
to
understand
how
absolutely
quiet
and
restful
should
be
the
conditions
of
any
invalid
it
sounds
absurd
to
say
that
noise
can
kill
anyone
but
noise
can
a
sudden
shock
can
undoubtedly
snap
the
thread
of
life
while
noise
constantly
wearing
on
the
brain
can
do
endless
harm
especially
to
those
who
are
predisposed
to
notice
and
resent
continually
unpleasant
sounds
and
now
i
want
to
give
a
hint
to
many
among
us
who
are
abjectly
miserable
because
they
fancy
they
have
some
incurable
complaint
and
yet
have
not
the
sense
or
courage
to
really
go
to
a
good
doctor
and
learn
what
is
the
matter
or
indeed
whether
there
is
anything
the
matter
at
all
the
tiny
lump
which
appears
on
the
neck
may
be
nothing
but
a
little
swelling
of
a
gland
or
it
may
be
cancer
the
dreadful
pain
that
seizes
the
chest
may
be
heart
or
it
may
be
indigestion
anyhow
whatever
it
is
it
is
far
better
to
know
what
is
the
matter
than
to
wear
oneself
to
death
in
wondering
if
we
have
or
have
not
a
fatal
disease
if
we
have
not
well
and
good
if
we
have
what
after
all
does
it
matter
we
have
all
fatal
diseases
if
it
comes
to
that
and
we
are
all
absolutely
sure
unpleasant
as
is
the
fact
that
we
must
die
and
it
is
something
to
know
a
little
about
the
means
and
time
by
which
we
shall
have
to
shuffle
off
this
mortal
coil
and
moreover
we
can
undoubtedly
save
ourselves
endless
trouble
and
stave
off
the
last
day
of
our
lives
if
we
learn
early
in
the
day
what
we
have
to
avoid
and
how
best
we
can
manage
our
lives
many
having
lost
them
entirely
because
they
literally
had
not
the
courage
to
go
to
the
doctor
or
went
to
him
so
late
that
he
had
sorrowfully
to
confess
he
could
do
nothing
albeit
he
could
have
done
much
had
the
patient
come
to
him
when
she
or
he
first
began
to
suspect
there
was
anything
amiss
i
could
i
am
sorry
to
say
quote
examples
from
my
own
dear
and
intimate
friends
of
the
evil
done
by
this
cowardly
dislike
to
face
the
worst
and
i
therefore
feel
very
strongly
on
the
subject
and
implore
any
of
my
readers
who
may
suspect
a
lurking
disease
to
face
it
it
may
be
nothing
but
fancy
even
so
the
fancy
should
be
exorcised
it
may
be
fatal
then
the
doctor
will
lay
down
rules
at
once
for
guidance
and
even
if
death
is
imminent
it
is
just
as
well
to
know
this
there
are
things
to
do
quietly
and
house
to
set
in
order
albeit
there
is
no
need
to
make
the
lives
of
all
relations
burdens
to
them
neither
need
we
make
ourselves
miserable
beforehand
by
everlasting
contemplation
of
the
inevitable
parting
be
quite
sure
whether
it
comes
at
at
at
we
none
of
us
realise
or
relish
the
idea
but
when
a
thing
must
be
it
is
best
to
accept
it
gracefully
people
will
remember
us
much
more
kindly
if
we
go
cheerfully
and
do
not
make
them
all
wretched
by
kicking
against
the
pricks
and
above
all
remember
if
you
have
a
disease
to
keep
the
fact
to
yourself
and
to
your
doctor
no
one
else
wants
to
hear
about
it
and
it
is
interesting
to
no
one
else
if
you
become
an
invalid
you
can
be
both
cheerful
and
useful
although
i
know
how
hateful
how
truly
hateful
it
is
to
put
up
the
once
active
feet
and
cross
the
once
busy
hands
and
simply
listen
to
what
we
once
used
to
do
i
know
too
that
a
good
listener
is
highly
appreciated
and
that
many
a
happy
home
finds
the
heart
of
the
house
round
the
invalid
sofa
where
can
always
be
found
someone
who
is
always
at
home
always
disengaged
always
willing
to
help
and
anxious
to
hear
and
who
has
a
most
profound
interest
in
all
that
is
going
on
despite
the
fact
that
she
is
out
of
the
action
and
can
only
take
a
passive
part
in
the
life
that
seemed
once
as
if
it
could
never
go
on
without
her
moreover
an
invalid
should
never
become
absorbed
in
herself
in
her
treatment
her
medicine
and
the
progress
of
her
malady
having
found
her
doctor
to
be
trustworthy
she
should
do
as
he
tells
her
and
after
his
visit
she
should
utterly
decline
to
speak
of
herself
she
should
read
if
possible
work
how
i
do
wish
i
could
sew
or
knit
or
do
anything
on
earth
save
read
and
write
and
above
all
she
should
be
absolutely
nice
and
particular
about
her
clothes
which
should
never
degenerate
unless
it
is
absolutely
necessary
into
the
stage
loose
garments
are
untidy
and
anything
untidy
or
assists
the
invalid
idea
which
should
be
kept
in
the
background
as
much
as
possible
then
there
is
another
thing
i
should
like
to
mention
and
that
is
that
invalids
should
always
have
their
affairs
settled
and
their
wishes
as
regards
the
future
of
their
children
or
their
property
entirely
and
properly
understood
that
is
to
say
understood
and
settled
as
far
as
anything
can
be
settled
that
is
so
unknown
as
the
future
and
while
a
man
is
an
absolute
criminal
who
neglects
to
make
his
will
a
woman
is
equally
foolish
who
having
strong
feelings
on
subjects
which
will
concern
her
children
or
may
be
the
place
of
her
burial
does
not
write
such
a
letter
on
the
subject
to
her
husband
to
be
opened
after
her
death
as
shall
lay
all
her
wishes
before
him
but
only
as
wishes
the
dead
hand
should
never
fetter
anyone
at
best
it
should
only
indicate
the
course
which
the
owner
would
have
followed
in
but
one
case
should
a
man
or
a
woman
who
has
property
put
an
emphatic
embargo
on
the
future
proceedings
of
the
husband
or
wife
and
then
only
if
there
are
children
and
that
is
in
the
case
of
the
husband
or
wife
remarrying
under
these
circumstances
the
property
should
go
absolutely
into
the
hands
of
trustees
to
be
administered
entirely
for
the
use
of
the
children
who
are
often
enough
defrauded
of
their
or
money
which
goes
to
keep
some
lazy
man
or
extravagant
woman
who
in
their
time
may
produce
children
to
share
that
which
was
only
meant
for
the
own
offspring
this
rule
should
never
be
departed
from
under
any
circumstances
it
should
be
absolutely
out
of
power
to
defraud
children
of
what
was
intended
for
them
alone
by
the
one
parent
who
had
money
this
does
not
prevent
a
man
or
a
woman
marrying
again
they
had
the
same
chances
if
they
wanted
them
as
they
had
before
but
it
does
prevent
the
children
being
robbed
as
i
have
known
them
robbed
in
more
than
one
case
by
their
silly
mothers
who
yearning
for
the
love
and
protection
they
have
lost
cast
themselves
into
the
arms
of
number
two
doubly
flattered
at
being
wooed
when
their
first
bloom
has
vanished
and
find
themselves
saddled
with
men
who
neglect
the
business
they
were
supposed
to
keep
together
or
squander
the
money
saved
so
hardly
and
set
aside
so
carefully
for
those
who
can
not
help
themselves
or
stay
the
marriage
that
will
inevitably
spoil
their
home
life
if
it
do
not
wreck
their
futures
let
the
wife
have
all
control
until
she
marries
again
then
someone
else
should
step
in
as
undoubtedly
if
a
woman
does
not
care
to
remember
her
husband
she
will
not
care
to
assure
herself
and
protect
his
children
from
an
extravagant
improvident
man
and
of
course
a
man
should
be
treated
in
the
same
way
all
control
as
long
as
he
remembers
his
wife
none
when
he
ceases
to
do
so
and
would
maintain
a
successor
out
of
the
money
she
meant
for
her
welfare
now
all
this
can
be
managed
and
indeed
should
be
managed
on
the
part
by
a
letter
written
to
her
husband
and
on
a
by
a
calm
conversation
with
his
wife
who
of
course
will
vow
that
nothing
on
this
earth
would
induce
her
to
marry
again
but
unfortunately
for
her
argument
example
can
be
brought
against
her
of
people
who
have
said
just
the
same
who
have
wept
in
the
marketplace
and
wrung
their
hands
in
high
places
to
speak
and
yet
have
married
generally
the
sake
of
the
dear
before
they
had
worn
out
their
mourning
and
therefore
her
protestations
can
be
gently
set
on
one
side
with
the
quiet
statement
that
in
that
case
the
money
will
be
in
her
own
power
this
can
show
no
lack
of
confidence
in
the
wife
it
simply
shows
a
lack
of
confidence
in
any
possible
future
husband
and
a
consummate
knowledge
of
human
nature
which
forgets
disagreeables
speedily
alas
and
accepts
hurriedly
any
chance
that
may
present
itself
of
obliterating
a
mournful
memory
and
changing
trappings
of
woe
for
newer
and
far
more
beaming
garments
i
never
could
understand
the
sensitiveness
that
prevents
some
wives
and
husbands
from
ever
speaking
of
the
future
that
must
come
when
they
will
be
separated
there
need
be
no
continual
discussion
of
the
mournful
subject
but
it
should
be
discussed
thoroughly
when
the
will
is
made
it
need
never
be
spoken
of
again
until
circumstances
arise
that
may
cause
some
alterations
to
be
made
or
codicils
added
anything
that
may
be
too
painful
to
discuss
can
be
written
in
the
final
letter
of
farewell
then
if
one
has
no
accumulations
of
other
letters
if
drawers
are
tidy
bills
paid
and
conscience
clear
there
will
be
nothing
to
make
anyone
after
we
have
departed
we
shall
have
done
our
work
left
everything
in
order
and
shall
leave
nothing
but
a
pleasant
memory
behind
us
death
as
a
rule
is
either
made
unduly
awful
or
is
a
time
of
the
most
extravagant
expenditure
the
immense
quantities
of
wreaths
sent
nowadays
have
brought
into
disrepute
one
of
the
most
charming
ideas
possible
and
the
money
once
devoted
to
black
plumes
and
millinery
of
all
kinds
to
extravagant
mourning
and
absurd
woe
is
now
squandered
equally
extravagantly
and
absurdly
on
wreaths
which
cost
from
to
each
and
which
are
simply
thrown
into
the
earth
to
perish
there
untimely
not
for
one
moment
would
i
deprecate
the
use
of
flowers
entirely
but
let
them
be
arranged
by
people
who
loved
me
and
really
bound
them
together
because
they
knew
i
loved
them
i
would
rather
spend
money
or
have
money
spent
on
some
useful
memorial
than
on
a
perishable
wreath
and
were
i
to
die
i
should
say
give
me
as
simple
as
cheap
a
funeral
as
you
can
and
give
the
money
to
my
pet
charity
it
could
be
done
in
my
name
and
would
be
a
practical
remembrance
of
me
and
a
far
more
useful
one
than
hundreds
of
wreaths
why
i
once
saw
a
funeral
in
where
there
were
over
wreaths
this
would
have
almost
built
a
ward
in
the
hospital
for
sick
children
it
would
certainly
have
helped
the
good
sisters
at
kilburn
and
have
done
great
good
to
the
children
there
who
had
always
been
loved
by
her
whose
funeral
it
was
and
in
the
same
way
would
i
deprecate
a
coffin
and
elaborate
headstone
neither
can
do
any
good
to
the
dead
and
the
memory
of
those
we
have
loved
can
be
perpetuated
a
thousand
times
longer
should
we
content
ourselves
with
the
simplest
oak
coffin
we
can
get
and
the
plain
cross
which
will
last
as
long
as
anyone
could
wish
it
to
while
the
money
saved
can
be
given
elsewhere
everyone
has
some
pet
scheme
that
could
be
benefited
by
his
or
her
death
no
one
but
the
undertaker
and
florist
is
benefited
now
another
reason
why
we
should
not
encourage
the
sending
of
an
immense
quantity
of
flowers
from
our
friends
is
that
there
is
something
almost
ghastly
about
the
false
air
of
festivity
given
by
the
constant
receipt
and
opening
of
the
parcels
and
boxes
in
which
they
are
sent
in
the
list
of
names
which
must
be
written
out
in
order
that
all
who
sent
may
be
thanked
or
their
names
mentioned
in
the
local
paper
and
in
the
smothered
remarks
of
the
servants
and
children
as
they
look
at
the
beauties
and
compare
the
present
one
with
the
last
one
laid
on
the
coffin
in
the
room
which
is
so
familiar
and
yet
has
become
so
fearfully
and
wonderfully
strange
but
if
flowers
need
not
be
sent
and
i
wish
i
could
think
all
would
send
the
money
instead
to
some
special
fund
letters
should
always
be
written
they
may
not
be
read
at
first
nay
may
never
be
really
read
at
all
but
the
name
of
the
writer
will
always
be
remembered
warmly
and
as
that
of
one
who
knew
that
sympathy
is
the
most
precious
gift
we
can
any
of
us
receive
when
we
are
in
the
depths
and
that
dark
curtain
descends
which
seems
as
if
it
would
lie
for
ever
between
us
and
the
outside
world
ah
me
no
matter
who
has
died
it
will
rise
again
and
life
will
flow
on
just
the
same
as
if
we
had
never
lost
those
who
were
so
near
and
so
dear
to
us
undoubtedly
too
though
we
should
none
of
us
ever
call
at
the
house
to
inquire
after
a
scarlet
fever
or
diphtheria
case
we
should
let
our
friends
know
through
the
post
that
we
are
thinking
of
them
if
their
child
is
ill
we
can
make
up
tiny
parcels
to
send
a
few
flowers
a
paper
doll
a
few
old
books
which
can
be
burned
as
soon
as
read
to
paste
into
books
odds
and
ends
which
cost
nothing
and
can
be
destroyed
without
a
pang
often
making
a
small
day
of
tedious
weariness
and
slow
convalescence
an
entirely
different
thing
to
what
it
might
have
otherwise
been
and
the
idea
of
what
post
may
bring
has
to
my
knowledge
more
than
once
soothed
a
tired
little
girl
to
rest
for
she
would
go
to
sleep
easier
when
she
remembered
that
the
sooner
the
night
was
over
the
sooner
the
familiar
ring
would
be
heard
and
the
lovely
parcel
would
arrive
which
might
contain
nothing
more
costly
than
glass
beads
for
stringing
or
some
roses
and
a
cheap
little
vase
to
put
them
in
but
which
was
a
source
of
wonder
and
delight
until
the
child
was
well
and
able
to
take
her
place
again
among
her
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
sick
room
which
may
be
the
death
chamber
sympathy
always
precious
becomes
an
absolute
necessity
and
a
tedious
day
of
pain
is
often
borne
more
courageously
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been
and
passes
quicker
than
it
otherwise
might
have
done
if
we
know
that
people
are
thinking
of
us
and
wondering
if
there
is
anything
they
can
do
to
lighten
our
time
of
trouble
and
to
help
us
bear
the
inevitable
misery
of
it
all
a
sick
person
or
an
invalid
should
never
be
forgotten
i
verily
believe
half
our
dread
of
death
comes
from
the
fact
that
we
know
that
soon
we
shall
be
as
if
we
had
never
been
and
that
our
place
shall
be
taken
by
another
and
shall
know
us
no
more
when
we
are
quite
sure
that
there
is
an
infectious
disease
in
our
house
we
ought
to
be
compelled
by
act
of
parliament
to
register
the
fact
at
some
convenient
place
where
a
list
of
houses
similarly
infected
should
undoubtedly
be
exposed
in
a
prominent
place
none
should
be
exempt
from
this
law
and
the
doctor
should
be
the
person
responsible
for
the
registration
a
severe
penalty
moreover
being
inflicted
in
any
case
of
wilful
misrepresentation
or
of
the
withholding
of
proper
information
of
the
outbreak
that
the
penalty
is
necessary
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
i
once
knew
a
country
doctor
speak
of
a
bad
attack
of
scarlet
fever
as
a
mild
case
of
rose
rash
because
he
was
abjectly
afraid
of
losing
the
patronage
of
the
dame
whose
child
it
was
and
who
objected
to
the
isolation
which
would
have
been
her
portion
had
the
truth
been
known
still
the
disease
spread
owing
to
her
selfishness
and
the
supineness
and
the
truth
came
out
but
not
before
she
had
done
endless
mischief
and
caused
the
death
of
a
child
of
one
of
her
relations
who
was
sent
into
the
house
with
his
nurse
to
inquire
after
the
rash
and
who
would
never
have
been
allowed
to
pass
even
the
same
side
of
the
street
had
his
mother
known
the
truth
and
both
the
doctor
and
the
mother
were
in
consequence
ostracised
and
isolated
from
their
far
more
completely
and
for
a
much
longer
period
than
they
would
have
been
had
they
boldly
and
at
once
told
the
truth
nowadays
with
the
slight
exception
of
the
law
that
we
must
not
wilfully
expose
anyone
suffering
from
an
infectious
disease
in
a
public
conveyance
we
may
do
pretty
much
as
we
like
a
we
can
send
other
members
of
the
family
to
church
or
the
theatre
we
can
send
our
washing
to
the
public
laundry
we
may
let
our
friends
come
and
see
us
without
mentioning
what
is
the
matter
and
in
fact
there
is
no
law
except
the
moral
law
which
governs
so
few
of
us
to
prevent
us
handing
on
the
complaint
to
as
many
people
as
we
can
comfortably
manage
to
infect
the
registration
would
prevent
this
as
it
would
prevent
us
from
stopping
in
a
or
as
happened
to
me
not
a
month
ago
from
sending
a
cat
to
be
doctored
in
a
house
where
there
was
a
fatal
case
of
scarlet
fever
and
how
that
cat
bring
it
back
to
us
is
more
than
i
can
understand
but
it
did
not
albeit
any
mother
can
understand
what
i
felt
until
i
knew
all
chance
of
infection
was
over
from
that
source
at
all
events
a
since
the
above
was
written
a
law
has
been
passed
to
make
the
notification
of
disease
compulsory
in
london
so
there
is
one
step
already
made
in
advance
it
is
the
selfishness
of
other
people
that
spreads
so
much
disease
and
therefore
the
law
should
force
people
to
be
more
considerate
then
disease
will
be
stamped
out
undoubtedly
and
we
can
exist
without
the
many
qualms
and
dreads
which
harass
us
now
and
certainly
go
far
to
make
life
anything
but
worth
living
now
i
think
if
i
had
an
infectious
complaint
in
the
house
my
first
idea
would
be
to
keep
people
out
of
it
i
should
place
a
placard
on
the
door
and
then
leave
folks
to
do
as
they
chose
in
the
matter
i
should
keep
the
rest
of
the
household
to
the
grounds
and
garden
and
i
should
much
as
i
should
hate
it
stay
as
much
at
home
as
i
possibly
could
of
course
the
usual
means
of
disinfection
would
be
largely
used
still
no
one
should
run
the
risk
of
giving
the
complaint
to
any
other
soul
the
doctor
would
be
the
person
to
say
what
is
infectious
and
what
is
not
but
despite
the
i
am
quite
certain
measles
and
mumps
can
not
be
carried
and
can
not
be
given
to
another
unless
by
the
person
who
actually
has
the
complaint
on
him
about
scarlet
fever
and
diphtheria
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
typhoid
can
not
be
carried
from
one
to
the
other
although
typhus
most
undoubtedly
may
be
but
in
any
case
the
doctor
is
the
person
to
apply
to
and
if
we
have
his
consent
we
can
go
about
the
world
as
usual
only
we
should
always
tell
our
friends
what
is
the
matter
and
if
they
object
to
us
we
must
not
be
offended
with
them
they
are
quite
right
to
object
and
we
should
not
resent
their
care
for
their
own
we
should
not
feel
happy
if
we
handed
on
the
complaint
and
what
should
we
experience
if
it
had
a
fatal
termination
i
for
one
can
not
imagine
there
is
absolutely
no
place
on
earth
which
requires
so
much
good
breeding
to
inhabit
or
arrange
for
properly
as
does
the
sick
room
therefore
i
trust
i
may
be
forgiven
if
i
write
rather
fully
on
the
matter
more
especially
as
this
book
is
coming
now
to
an
end
and
i
shall
never
write
any
more
on
the
subject
of
the
home
and
i
want
to
say
a
word
to
the
patient
remember
however
bad
it
is
for
you
to
be
ill
it
is
fifty
times
worse
for
those
who
have
to
see
you
suffer
and
that
you
must
even
at
your
worst
think
about
that
and
remember
other
people
do
not
make
their
anxiety
greater
by
refusing
food
or
medicine
or
by
disobeying
your
doctor
or
nurse
for
the
time
give
yourself
entirely
into
their
hands
and
do
not
refuse
or
kick
against
their
remedies
their
rules
and
regulations
be
absolutely
calm
absolutely
quiet
and
above
all
if
you
want
to
get
well
do
not
lose
your
hold
on
life
if
you
can
and
fret
or
become
terrified
fear
and
fretting
are
a
worst
foes
almost
worse
than
disobedience
if
you
can
recollect
that
whatever
is
is
best
and
that
you
will
recover
if
it
is
better
that
you
should
you
will
have
a
thousand
chances
that
the
irritable
invalid
can
never
have
and
at
all
events
if
you
do
die
you
will
die
courageously
and
resignedly
and
not
screaming
and
kicking
like
a
naughty
child
does
whose
nurse
fetches
it
away
to
bed
before
it
thinks
it
is
ready
to
retire
to
rest
its
nurse
knows
best
and
so
does
god
and
if
you
are
fetched
ten
chances
to
one
your
work
is
done
and
you
can
retire
from
the
scene
gracefully
even
if
you
can
not
feel
you
are
quite
glad
to
go
i
am
certain
that
the
mind
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
body
from
a
small
experience
of
my
own
when
once
i
was
saved
from
being
very
ill
by
a
mere
exercise
of
will
rendered
necessary
by
a
sudden
shock
received
when
one
of
my
children
was
only
two
days
old
my
dear
old
nurse
was
in
my
room
at
and
at
she
was
dead
in
the
room
next
to
mine
and
i
knew
all
about
it
there
were
the
two
eldest
children
who
were
five
and
three
running
about
calling
for
from
whom
they
had
never
been
separated
five
minutes
since
the
hour
they
were
born
i
had
a
new
housemaid
i
had
seen
in
the
the
monthly
nurse
drinking
brandy
out
of
the
bottle
and
told
nan
of
this
and
i
was
absolutely
alone
as
far
as
friends
were
concerned
could
any
situation
be
worse
and
yet
before
i
slept
i
had
arranged
for
the
children
to
go
to
london
for
the
funeral
to
take
place
soon
and
for
the
friends
to
be
told
and
then
began
the
struggle
my
doctor
was
confined
to
the
house
with
bronchitis
circumstances
made
his
partner
impossible
the
nearest
medical
man
on
whom
one
could
depend
was
fourteen
miles
away
and
i
knew
i
must
not
be
ill
and
all
that
wretched
night
i
kept
saying
this
to
myself
repeating
who
i
was
where
i
was
and
what
had
happened
until
i
felt
i
was
master
of
the
situation
surely
had
i
given
in
then
i
should
have
had
a
fever
as
it
was
i
occasionally
felt
my
head
was
loose
and
swimming
round
the
room
by
itself
and
it
was
only
by
repeating
to
myself
that
this
was
impossible
that
i
kept
off
the
delusion
and
after
a
day
or
two
i
was
nearly
well
or
at
all
events
was
not
ill
in
the
accepted
sense
of
the
word
though
my
dear
old
doctor
nearly
wept
when
i
told
him
what
i
had
endured
and
never
could
understand
to
his
dying
day
why
i
had
not
had
a
serious
illness
which
i
undoubtedly
must
have
had
had
i
not
staved
it
off
in
the
manner
i
have
just
described
therefore
i
am
convinced
those
patients
have
the
best
chance
of
recovering
who
are
quiet
obedient
and
who
furthermore
try
their
best
to
live
and
believe
that
there
is
something
worth
living
for
and
now
a
few
words
on
that
saddest
of
all
subjects
a
death
and
i
must
devote
my
last
chapter
to
more
cheerful
subjects
namely
how
best
to
get
strong
and
well
again
once
we
have
emerged
from
the
sick
room
and
are
pronounced
fit
and
able
to
go
for
a
change
when
death
has
actually
occurred
i
would
strongly
advocate
that
those
who
have
loved
and
nursed
the
dead
may
prepare
the
body
for
the
last
it
can
be
gently
washed
and
attired
in
the
clean
and
the
hands
can
be
crossed
on
the
breast
someone
who
can
be
trusted
not
a
mere
hireling
should
be
present
when
the
last
measurements
are
taken
then
the
room
should
be
at
once
turned
into
a
mortuary
chamber
the
bed
hung
with
white
candles
lighted
head
and
foot
which
should
not
go
out
until
the
funeral
day
and
fresh
flowers
should
be
kept
there
these
should
be
changed
every
single
day
and
furthermore
the
windows
should
be
left
a
little
open
and
on
no
account
should
the
dead
person
be
left
unwatched
for
a
moment
until
the
coffin
is
screwed
down
this
should
never
be
done
until
there
is
no
doubt
that
death
has
ensued
and
then
the
sooner
the
funeral
is
the
better
though
i
trust
some
day
cremation
may
be
universal
then
there
can
be
no
dread
of
the
awful
fate
of
one
who
is
buried
alive
that
ought
to
be
made
impossible
in
all
cases
by
the
doctor
performing
some
simple
surgical
operation
i
think
it
is
the
dividing
of
some
artery
in
the
arm
if
the
dead
person
has
been
attached
to
any
particular
church
in
his
or
her
the
coffin
should
be
placed
in
that
church
the
night
before
the
funeral
so
that
the
last
night
above
ground
the
body
may
rest
in
that
hallowed
spot
of
course
it
should
be
watched
there
and
the
candles
and
flowers
should
be
arranged
as
in
the
mortuary
chamber
and
the
first
part
of
the
service
should
be
read
there
not
by
a
stranger
but
by
the
family
priest
of
whom
i
have
spoken
before
and
then
when
the
ceremony
is
over
no
one
but
the
clergyman
should
return
to
the
house
with
the
mourners
who
should
separate
and
go
to
their
own
rooms
there
should
be
no
general
family
meal
that
day
at
least
certainly
there
should
be
no
gathering
even
of
relations
and
friends
round
the
i
have
experienced
more
than
one
of
these
awful
meals
and
i
can
truthfully
say
that
there
is
nothing
more
terrible
on
earth
people
must
talk
they
can
not
remain
silent
they
must
eat
and
drink
and
the
and
the
endeavour
to
keep
off
and
avoid
subject
are
so
truly
ghastly
that
under
no
circumstances
can
i
understand
such
a
thing
can
be
in
any
way
necessary
in
the
least
surely
as
unnecessary
is
also
the
reading
of
the
will
what
concerns
the
public
can
be
told
the
public
the
lawyers
should
manage
the
rest
under
no
circumstances
should
the
display
of
evil
passions
and
disappointments
be
allowed
that
almost
inevitably
follows
this
institution
let
the
be
a
day
of
meditation
and
quiet
in
the
evening
the
bereaved
family
can
gather
alone
and
talk
over
what
has
to
be
done
then
the
next
day
let
all
the
clothes
be
sent
to
the
kilburn
orphanage
and
the
personal
property
distributed
according
to
the
wish
of
the
dead
let
the
death
room
be
entirely
repapered
and
painted
and
if
possible
refurnished
and
above
all
do
not
be
afraid
to
speak
of
those
who
have
gone
i
know
how
i
should
resent
being
forgotten
and
perhaps
those
with
whom
we
have
just
parted
may
hunger
to
hear
all
about
us
still
at
all
events
we
can
not
know
they
do
not
may
mean
a
great
deal
more
than
we
think
it
is
doubly
evil
surely
to
speak
aught
but
good
of
the
dead
if
we
remember
not
only
the
defencelessness
which
caused
that
proverb
but
the
idea
that
all
we
may
say
about
them
we
say
in
their
dumb
presence
and
before
those
who
are
silent
and
can
not
speak
in
their
own
defence
death
is
a
dreadful
thing
because
of
its
silence
its
separation
yet
if
we
meet
it
patiently
if
we
believe
our
dead
are
still
within
reach
we
can
bear
it
more
especially
if
we
do
our
best
to
carry
out
their
wishes
and
do
not
the
moment
they
are
gone
begin
to
reverse
all
their
ideas
and
plans
and
to
forget
them
as
speedily
as
may
be
while
when
our
own
time
comes
we
can
face
it
bravely
feeling
we
are
setting
a
good
example
and
leaving
behind
us
nothing
to
pain
or
embarrass
anyone
nothing
but
a
bright
remembrance
a
good
record
that
may
sooner
or
later
be
of
use
to
others
after
us
the
sick
room
has
more
than
once
been
the
heart
of
the
house
the
death
chamber
in
its
turn
can
become
if
properly
thought
of
the
very
gate
of
heaven
itself
chapter
xii
where
shall
we
go
for
a
change
i
think
there
is
nothing
that
tries
an
ordinary
householder
more
than
answering
the
question
with
which
i
have
headed
this
my
last
chapter
in
the
first
place
as
a
rule
few
men
consider
that
a
change
can
possibly
be
required
it
seems
only
the
other
day
that
they
returned
from
the
last
uncomfortable
sojourn
at
some
unhappy
seaside
town
and
they
are
quite
convinced
that
a
second
martyrdom
can
not
be
necessary
just
at
present
in
the
second
when
change
is
really
wanted
no
one
knows
where
to
go
and
in
the
third
if
the
place
be
selected
and
the
rooms
taken
the
unfortunate
creature
is
sure
to
meet
someone
who
knows
all
about
it
and
proceeds
to
make
his
friend
profoundly
miserable
by
telling
him
that
that
especial
town
is
only
decent
at
the
very
time
of
year
when
he
can
not
possibly
go
there
that
he
knows
for
certain
an
epidemic
is
raging
there
and
that
the
rooms
taken
for
weeks
are
in
the
very
worst
part
both
for
health
and
comfort
and
that
he
can
but
wish
him
well
home
again
and
the
unfortunate
traveller
starts
depressed
and
nervous
and
having
made
up
his
mind
to
be
miserable
is
so
and
derives
no
benefit
whatever
from
that
which
was
to
do
him
and
his
soul
an
immense
amount
of
good
now
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
english
people
as
a
rule
do
not
show
the
smallest
common
sense
in
the
manner
they
manage
their
holidays
more
especially
of
course
among
the
middle
classes
the
upper
portion
of
which
often
enough
have
a
tiny
cottage
somewhere
of
which
they
speak
grandly
as
country
house
and
the
address
of
which
is
inscribed
on
their
cards
and
mentioned
in
the
and
they
fly
to
this
the
moment
the
weather
becomes
in
the
least
warm
remaining
there
until
they
are
driven
back
by
the
falling
leaves
and
chilling
fogs
of
an
october
in
the
country
and
then
wonder
they
are
so
little
benefited
why
they
have
not
had
any
change
no
more
at
least
than
those
a
shade
lower
in
the
social
scale
who
go
to
the
same
year
after
year
spend
their
mornings
on
the
beach
their
afternoons
in
slumber
or
a
walk
and
their
evenings
on
the
pier
or
parade
and
who
see
the
same
people
say
the
same
things
and
do
the
same
actions
mechanically
as
they
do
in
town
only
perhaps
in
a
smaller
space
and
under
far
more
uncomfortable
circumstances
the
very
stupidest
thing
on
earth
to
my
mind
is
the
annual
sojourn
of
a
large
family
of
small
children
accompanied
by
their
parents
to
the
orthodox
seaside
rooms
or
lodgings
in
the
first
place
the
parents
children
and
nurses
are
very
much
too
much
together
the
annoyances
of
the
predatory
habits
of
the
landladies
spoil
temper
the
servants
are
disorganised
and
imagine
that
because
the
family
makes
holiday
they
are
to
be
in
some
measure
allowed
to
do
just
as
they
like
and
much
resent
being
unable
to
make
excursions
and
ramble
at
large
whether
it
is
convenient
or
not
for
their
mistress
to
spare
them
and
indeed
i
do
not
know
a
more
driven
creature
than
the
ordinary
materfamilias
at
the
seaside
more
especially
if
she
has
left
her
own
large
airy
house
with
its
nurseries
and
schoolrooms
and
taken
lodgings
at
a
fashionable
spot
where
every
inch
of
space
costs
pounds
and
where
she
can
never
rid
herself
of
her
family
for
one
moment
it
is
in
her
defence
that
i
suggest
that
change
of
air
should
be
obtained
in
a
far
easier
and
more
satisfactory
manner
than
it
can
be
under
the
circumstances
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
as
long
as
the
children
are
quite
small
i
most
strongly
advise
any
mother
to
send
them
to
the
seaside
in
the
end
of
may
and
let
them
remain
there
until
the
first
or
second
week
in
july
she
should
send
them
to
some
cottage
under
the
care
of
a
lady
who
would
be
thankful
to
superintend
them
for
the
mere
fare
change
keep
that
would
be
such
a
boon
to
her
and
she
should
send
their
nurses
with
them
in
this
early
portion
of
the
year
lodgings
are
cheap
and
clean
and
so
are
provisions
the
days
are
longer
the
heat
not
so
great
as
later
on
and
the
children
would
come
back
when
london
was
thinning
and
the
parks
and
streets
safe
for
them
to
be
in
and
at
the
end
of
july
having
settled
the
children
in
the
father
and
mother
could
go
for
the
complete
change
and
rest
they
both
need
so
greatly
and
which
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
have
encumbered
by
their
household
duties
and
cares
which
must
be
taken
with
them
if
they
move
their
servants
and
children
to
some
seaside
place
for
august
and
september
very
young
children
if
proper
nurses
and
superintendents
are
found
for
them
do
not
require
the
companionship
we
shall
not
be
able
to
give
them
later
on
if
we
wear
ourselves
out
in
their
service
when
they
are
very
small
by
this
i
do
not
naturally
mean
that
children
should
be
neglected
or
left
entirely
to
the
mercy
of
hirelings
far
be
it
from
me
to
suggest
anything
so
dreadful
but
i
do
maintain
that
for
six
weeks
of
the
year
they
would
be
quite
as
well
at
the
seaside
without
their
parents
as
they
would
be
with
them
more
especially
if
the
cottage
they
are
sent
to
is
well
known
and
the
people
who
keep
it
are
acquaintances
while
of
course
both
the
lady
superintendent
and
the
nurses
should
not
be
new
but
should
be
thoroughly
tested
by
some
amount
of
service
before
they
are
trusted
it
is
better
should
we
determine
to
send
the
children
away
as
i
have
suggested
to
pay
so
much
per
head
for
all
the
board
and
lodging
expenses
combined
no
servant
and
indeed
very
few
governesses
can
be
trusted
to
i
can
not
tell
why
but
the
moment
they
are
allowed
to
order
the
food
and
make
purchases
for
the
household
they
all
become
most
wildly
extravagant
and
have
no
more
notion
of
managing
than
they
have
of
flying
they
may
of
course
have
the
truly
british
notion
that
and
must
go
and
proceed
to
demonstrate
this
by
the
exorbitant
demands
made
upon
purse
anyhow
whatever
the
reason
it
is
an
axiom
that
housekeeping
can
not
be
trusted
to
either
and
that
we
should
make
arrangements
for
board
as
well
as
lodging
unless
we
wish
to
be
fairly
appalled
by
the
weekly
bills
as
an
illustration
i
may
mention
that
the
only
time
i
sent
my
children
to
the
sea
with
the
governess
allowing
her
to
cater
for
them
all
the
bills
she
sent
me
home
for
herself
the
german
maid
and
three
children
were
exactly
treble
what
i
paid
for
ourselves
and
the
same
number
of
children
and
six
servants
and
that
she
did
not
consider
it
improper
to
give
for
a
chicken
and
for
a
pound
of
grapes
from
this
my
readers
will
perceive
that
i
am
warning
them
out
of
my
own
experience
and
this
governess
moreover
was
an
elderly
woman
who
had
lived
with
us
a
great
many
years
and
really
had
in
some
measure
our
interest
at
heart
therefore
i
am
convinced
neither
governess
nor
servants
can
make
good
managers
they
are
always
provided
for
as
far
as
food
is
concerned
they
never
have
to
provide
and
therefore
know
nothing
about
it
i
think
once
we
have
discovered
a
spot
that
really
suits
the
children
it
is
best
to
keep
to
that
as
children
simply
require
good
sands
and
good
air
and
do
not
trouble
themselves
about
scenery
deal
is
absolutely
delightful
as
regards
air
but
the
beach
is
unsafe
and
pebbly
and
has
no
sand
margate
is
quite
perfect
so
is
westgate
while
swanage
in
spring
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
except
for
children
who
require
bracing
air
then
swanage
is
not
for
one
moment
to
be
compared
to
either
of
the
places
i
have
named
which
are
also
near
enough
to
town
for
the
parents
to
run
down
and
see
the
children
should
they
wish
to
do
so
and
indeed
as
they
ought
to
do
to
learn
how
they
are
getting
on
personally
i
know
nothing
of
the
east
coast
but
i
believe
there
are
plenty
of
little
places
about
there
where
the
children
would
be
happy
well
and
safe
and
i
should
recommend
anyone
before
finally
choosing
the
summer
home
of
the
children
to
make
an
exhaustive
survey
of
the
english
coast
and
having
found
one
place
which
will
suit
then
to
stick
to
that
until
the
children
are
twelve
years
old
then
one
would
have
to
begin
to
alter
plans
a
little
more
especially
if
the
boys
go
to
school
and
are
only
at
home
in
the
holidays
then
the
children
and
parents
must
go
out
together
else
they
will
never
meet
and
will
grow
up
like
strangers
to
each
other
during
the
minority
so
to
speak
of
the
children
the
parents
would
be
wise
to
spend
their
holidays
in
learning
which
would
be
the
nicest
places
to
take
the
children
to
when
they
are
beginning
to
grow
up
they
should
make
and
keep
notes
of
excursions
advantages
prices
and
houses
and
should
be
able
to
refer
to
them
in
a
moment
when
they
have
to
decide
on
the
place
where
they
are
to
spend
their
holiday
in
they
must
not
trust
to
their
memory
the
best
of
memories
will
not
retain
the
names
of
the
house
agents
the
position
of
the
different
streets
and
the
aspect
of
the
different
houses
while
the
notes
would
be
always
there
to
refer
to
and
would
be
of
immense
service
to
them
in
more
ways
than
one
now
having
made
up
their
minds
to
the
change
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
a
house
not
rooms
should
be
taken
if
anyone
is
to
enjoy
the
holiday
at
all
there
can
be
no
freedom
and
very
little
enjoyment
and
there
is
great
risk
of
infection
at
the
seaside
unless
the
house
is
shared
by
someone
we
may
happen
to
know
if
we
take
only
a
part
of
a
house
we
may
have
a
fidgety
mortal
who
sends
up
twenty
times
a
day
to
ask
our
children
to
be
quiet
or
we
may
have
a
screaming
badly
managed
baby
near
us
a
piano
which
plays
just
when
we
want
it
to
play
or
we
may
meet
on
the
stairs
a
convalescent
from
some
childish
complaint
who
may
hand
it
on
to
our
children
and
bring
our
holiday
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
with
measles
or
then
there
are
always
the
landlady
the
larder
difficulties
and
the
horrors
of
being
waited
on
by
strange
servants
generally
most
inferior
ones
and
always
those
who
can
not
and
do
not
understand
our
ways
therefore
i
maintain
that
a
house
is
a
quÃ¢
and
that
if
we
can
not
afford
to
take
one
and
go
away
comfortably
we
had
better
remain
at
home
if
we
leave
we
may
get
fresher
air
we
shall
have
the
necessary
change
but
the
change
will
be
for
the
worse
and
the
good
the
fresher
air
may
do
will
be
more
than
outbalanced
by
the
continual
rasping
worry
of
arranging
and
very
likely
battling
with
the
servants
who
resent
the
interference
and
do
any
more
work
than
they
can
help
under
the
mistaken
idea
that
the
are
to
wait
on
them
and
in
the
endless
worries
caused
by
the
disappearance
of
food
and
the
disagreeable
feeling
that
everything
one
touches
has
probably
been
well
by
the
maid
if
not
by
the
mistress
herself
if
therefore
as
i
remarked
before
we
can
not
afford
to
go
away
comfortably
we
had
better
remain
at
home
going
away
in
detachments
if
the
doctor
thinks
that
the
weaker
members
must
have
sea
air
in
that
case
visits
can
always
be
managed
for
everyone
almost
has
relations
or
friends
in
the
country
or
knows
of
some
nice
family
who
will
take
in
a
stray
child
or
two
and
for
with
their
own
while
if
the
boys
are
away
at
school
they
are
quite
satisfied
to
return
to
their
own
haunts
while
no
end
of
excursions
can
be
made
from
london
and
in
and
round
london
which
is
it
must
be
confessed
just
a
little
hot
in
august
and
smells
just
a
little
of
fruit
and
dead
cabbage
leaves
but
is
positively
delightful
in
september
with
its
soft
skies
and
its
wonderful
effects
of
cloud
and
sunshine
and
which
has
always
something
amusing
to
show
those
who
really
appreciate
the
most
delightful
and
picturesque
city
in
the
whole
world
i
love
my
london
even
in
august
when
the
parks
are
empty
of
fashionable
people
but
full
of
the
most
beautiful
flowers
and
palms
which
only
those
who
remain
in
town
in
that
unfashionable
month
ever
see
at
their
prime
and
despite
the
heat
and
the
odours
in
the
streets
i
would
rather
be
in
london
than
in
a
cramped
lodging
at
the
sea
where
i
was
inundated
with
children
worried
by
bad
service
and
had
none
of
my
own
belongings
about
me
and
in
fact
had
not
time
to
read
or
sit
alone
to
enjoy
myself
in
the
peace
and
quiet
that
are
absolutely
necessary
to
make
a
holiday
even
endurable
i
hope
my
readers
will
not
think
i
am
writing
of
what
i
do
not
know
when
i
say
that
london
in
august
and
september
is
quite
as
beautiful
and
entrancing
as
it
is
in
the
heart
of
the
season
i
have
been
for
the
last
seven
years
constantly
in
the
beloved
city
in
those
unfashionable
months
and
i
unreservedly
advise
anyone
in
want
of
a
real
change
to
go
up
to
town
then
they
will
learn
and
see
more
then
than
at
any
other
time
they
will
not
be
hurried
they
will
be
able
to
see
everything
quietly
and
will
really
see
what
they
never
can
when
the
roads
are
crammed
with
carriages
and
the
streets
with
people
how
beautiful
london
is
and
how
many
things
she
possesses
we
never
dream
of
when
we
are
simply
rushing
from
occupation
to
amusement
and
are
only
thinking
of
our
work
or
pleasure
however
as
i
can
not
expect
all
to
believe
me
or
to
share
my
enthusiasm
for
the
streets
and
that
i
adore
i
will
simply
now
advise
my
readers
how
to
proceed
once
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
go
away
if
possible
they
should
let
their
own
house
if
not
they
should
endeavour
always
to
keep
to
the
same
caretaker
who
should
if
possible
be
married
to
a
policeman
and
have
a
dog
but
no
children
the
furniture
should
be
covered
over
and
to
by
the
upholsterer
who
understands
how
to
prepare
for
possible
moth
and
damp
and
who
will
not
make
an
exorbitant
charge
for
what
will
as
a
rule
prevent
most
of
the
things
from
being
spoiled
fires
should
be
ordered
no
matter
what
the
weather
may
be
in
rotation
all
through
the
house
for
one
that
is
uninhabited
and
in
which
very
little
gas
if
any
will
be
burned
always
becomes
damp
in
our
climate
while
it
would
be
wise
to
have
the
gas
cut
off
at
the
meter
entirely
we
should
save
a
great
deal
of
waste
and
as
caretakers
are
used
to
lamps
in
their
own
abodes
we
should
run
no
risk
of
fire
not
as
much
as
we
do
when
we
leave
the
gas
for
the
use
of
those
who
often
enough
have
never
had
any
control
over
it
on
their
own
account
and
so
have
not
learned
how
to
save
it
or
even
use
it
no
valuables
should
be
left
in
the
house
all
should
be
sent
to
the
bank
and
we
should
naturally
take
our
plate
with
us
for
use
but
having
taken
our
house
by
the
sea
we
should
in
some
measure
know
what
it
wants
and
we
should
invariably
have
ornaments
photographs
to
take
with
us
to
brighten
up
the
house
and
to
make
it
while
the
children
must
take
their
work
and
playthings
we
must
in
fact
prepare
in
every
way
we
can
for
a
rainy
day
rain
must
fall
and
if
the
children
have
their
books
and
toys
and
their
own
rooms
they
will
be
as
happy
and
be
no
more
of
a
nuisance
by
the
sea
than
they
are
at
home
at
least
if
they
are
it
will
be
the
fault
of
the
parents
and
not
of
the
unfortunate
children
themselves
i
have
always
had
three
very
large
wicker
baskets
set
apart
for
using
at
similar
crises
of
our
existence
one
holds
the
household
linen
another
the
nursery
and
schoolroom
toys
and
books
and
the
third
is
set
apart
for
loose
cretonne
covers
serge
and
any
amount
of
photographs
and
ornaments
to
render
the
temporary
house
for
even
if
i
find
my
new
domicile
replete
with
ornaments
i
always
put
them
all
away
at
once
ornaments
are
always
priceless
when
the
reckoning
comes
to
be
taken
they
possibly
be
harmed
if
they
retired
into
a
cupboard
the
moment
we
arrived
and
only
emerged
from
their
seclusion
the
day
we
leave
if
the
china
and
glass
in
a
house
are
really
expensive
and
good
i
also
put
them
all
away
and
i
purchase
for
our
own
use
the
very
cheapest
ware
i
can
find
china
and
glass
are
so
very
cheap
nowadays
that
it
is
far
better
to
do
this
than
be
made
to
pay
fabulous
sums
for
the
china
which
seems
to
one
so
hideous
and
is
only
costly
because
in
these
artistic
days
of
ours
it
is
impossible
to
match
it
the
contents
of
my
basket
soon
make
even
a
hideous
room
much
better
while
one
feels
that
one
need
not
always
be
on
the
as
one
must
be
to
protect
another
property
if
one
does
not
take
these
precautions
but
as
a
rule
furnished
houses
are
so
absolutely
unfurnished
and
ugly
i
am
thankful
to
cover
up
what
i
find
and
so
in
some
measure
mitigate
the
horrors
of
my
surroundings
by
putting
about
as
many
of
my
own
belongings
as
i
can
take
with
me
we
also
when
we
go
away
always
put
at
the
top
of
each
separate
box
that
own
sheets
and
quilt
and
i
never
go
away
without
some
spare
pillows
and
any
amount
of
cushions
this
sounds
luxurious
but
why
should
we
be
uncomfortable
because
we
are
not
at
home
on
the
contrary
because
we
are
not
we
ought
to
take
more
care
than
ever
that
all
shall
be
as
nice
as
we
can
make
it
while
the
sheets
and
being
ready
the
servants
have
no
trouble
in
settling
in
the
first
evening
they
open
the
boxes
and
make
the
beds
at
once
with
sheets
we
know
are
aired
and
therefore
even
in
the
confusion
that
is
generally
apparent
at
these
times
we
have
no
risk
of
spending
our
first
night
between
damp
sheets
another
thing
we
should
provide
ourselves
with
is
a
hamper
of
groceries
and
if
we
are
to
arrive
late
with
sufficient
cooked
food
to
supply
the
establishment
for
the
night
and
next
morning
each
servant
should
be
told
off
to
certain
duties
and
no
hurry
or
confusion
should
be
allowed
all
except
one
box
in
which
to
put
the
last
things
should
be
locked
and
strapped
the
night
before
and
the
luggage
should
be
at
the
station
in
good
time
the
tickets
should
all
be
procured
or
at
least
ordered
the
day
before
and
if
these
simple
precautions
are
taken
the
journey
need
be
hardly
any
trouble
at
all
it
must
be
some
but
nothing
to
speak
of
when
the
servants
know
their
work
are
ready
in
advance
and
are
not
allowed
to
forget
anything
not
even
the
harmless
necessary
cat
now
a
few
words
about
the
animals
and
let
me
beg
anyone
who
has
cats
and
dogs
to
take
these
poor
things
with
them
we
always
do
the
dogs
go
with
the
horses
the
cats
with
the
servants
and
they
never
attempt
to
stray
they
are
absolutely
and
abjectly
miserable
if
we
leave
them
at
home
even
with
a
caretaker
while
they
cost
nothing
to
take
and
are
happy
with
us
just
as
in
fact
they
are
at
home
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
or
to
those
people
who
are
wicked
enough
to
their
cats
or
leave
them
shut
out
in
the
garden
to
forage
for
themselves
they
must
be
such
cruel
wretches
that
i
hope
they
may
not
even
read
this
book
but
many
people
possessed
of
the
kindest
hearts
have
no
compunction
in
leaving
their
cats
to
caretakers
little
understanding
how
these
poor
things
pine
for
the
human
companionship
to
which
they
are
accustomed
and
after
which
they
long
pitifully
now
a
cat
costs
nothing
a
dog
very
little
to
take
so
i
do
hope
all
who
can
will
consider
if
their
holiday
can
not
be
shared
by
their
dumb
friends
i
am
sure
they
will
never
regret
it
if
they
make
up
their
minds
to
take
them
with
them
when
once
settled
in
the
temporary
house
all
should
be
found
out
that
there
is
to
be
found
out
about
the
points
of
interest
in
the
neighbourhood
and
all
these
should
be
visited
as
a
rule
a
local
is
very
little
real
use
but
one
should
always
be
obtained
and
studied
in
connection
with
the
county
history
holiday
is
a
thousand
times
more
profitable
and
pleasant
if
we
see
all
there
is
to
be
seen
and
do
not
waste
our
time
listening
to
an
inferior
band
or
hanging
about
on
the
pier
wearing
smart
clothes
which
are
entirely
out
of
place
by
the
sea
indeed
blue
serge
should
be
the
only
wear
as
far
as
young
people
are
concerned
with
flannels
for
boys
i
remember
how
wretched
we
used
to
be
over
our
light
print
and
muslin
frocks
in
consequence
of
which
i
have
always
taken
care
our
children
should
never
have
anything
that
they
had
to
think
about
on
the
shore
half
our
pleasure
used
to
be
spoiled
by
the
idea
that
we
should
have
to
pay
for
it
by
being
scolded
by
our
governess
for
the
sandy
wet
garments
inseparable
from
any
real
play
by
the
fascinating
sea
now
with
the
high
boots
we
buy
at
scarborough
and
serge
skirts
and
of
serge
no
girl
can
possibly
harm
paddle
how
she
may
while
the
same
high
boots
and
serge
or
flannel
suits
make
the
boys
quite
happy
the
boots
protect
the
feet
from
possible
cuts
and
do
away
with
any
hygienic
difficulties
many
people
refusing
to
allow
their
children
to
paddle
because
feet
should
not
be
wet
if
the
heads
can
not
be
wet
too
the
feet
do
not
get
wet
in
these
high
boots
and
therefore
provided
with
them
the
last
objection
to
paddling
is
quite
done
away
with
and
without
paddling
what
is
the
seashore
very
little
to
the
children
who
can
not
have
too
much
of
this
most
delightful
amusement
the
sea
is
the
best
holiday
companion
one
can
have
i
therefore
most
strongly
advise
all
who
are
bent
on
a
holiday
for
the
children
to
take
them
to
the
sea
and
not
to
the
inland
country
where
if
it
be
wet
mud
keeps
them
prisoners
whereas
by
the
sea
rain
dries
up
at
once
and
there
is
always
something
to
look
at
for
of
course
the
ideal
holiday
house
faces
the
sea
and
has
a
good
view
of
whatever
is
going
on
and
now
having
said
all
i
can
about
the
holiday
let
me
add
just
a
few
words
about
sharing
the
holiday
if
in
any
way
possible
with
some
child
or
someone
who
can
not
afford
to
go
away
at
all
unless
a
friendly
invitation
manages
this
for
them
i
have
written
very
little
about
charities
in
this
book
but
i
could
have
set
down
much
on
the
subject
and
i
may
say
that
the
truest
of
all
charities
is
that
which
quietly
and
unostentatiously
helps
that
most
unfortunate
most
deserving
of
all
classes
the
poor
lady
or
gentleman
who
is
too
to
be
assisted
with
money
but
who
requires
help
a
thousand
times
more
than
the
very
very
poor
to
whom
one
can
give
a
few
shillings
no
one
ever
thinks
of
the
underpaid
curate
or
the
orphan
child
we
could
when
we
take
our
house
for
the
holidays
surely
reserve
a
corner
for
them
they
are
pleasant
visitors
and
we
shall
have
the
delightful
feeling
that
while
our
children
have
been
gaining
strength
we
have
helped
others
to
do
the
same
most
people
contrive
to
have
visitors
while
they
are
away
let
them
be
those
who
would
not
have
gone
away
at
all
had
we
not
asked
them
to
come
to
us
while
we
are
at
the
sea
they
can
generally
manage
the
railway
fare
while
of
course
we
can
judiciously
contrive
that
they
are
not
forced
into
any
expense
for
excursions
if
we
take
them
we
can
easily
manage
this
if
we
have
the
smallest
tact
while
of
course
we
must
not
affront
them
by
boldly
offering
to
pay
their
fare
but
if
we
are
accustomed
to
go
and
yet
know
would
suit
our
pocket
better
we
can
all
go
third
boldly
it
will
not
hurt
us
one
bit
and
it
will
save
them
from
the
unpleasantness
of
spending
more
than
they
can
afford
or
of
being
paid
for
by
us
which
would
be
terrible
for
them
there
is
still
another
holiday
of
which
i
wish
to
speak
and
then
i
shall
lay
down
my
pen
and
close
my
book
and
that
is
the
yearly
all
husbands
and
wives
should
try
and
manage
to
take
together
nothing
so
keeps
up
the
bond
of
affection
between
them
as
this
particularly
when
both
are
busy
people
and
see
nothing
at
all
of
each
other
during
the
day
and
are
often
too
tired
in
the
evening
to
speak
at
all
except
on
the
most
necessary
subjects
and
even
if
they
are
not
tired
there
are
always
the
boys
and
girls
about
once
they
have
begun
to
grow
up
and
there
is
no
time
they
can
call
their
own
none
in
which
they
can
talk
as
they
used
to
do
none
in
which
they
can
discuss
the
future
or
talk
about
their
own
plans
and
hopes
and
wishes
of
course
i
am
told
many
husbands
and
wives
are
only
too
thankful
to
be
spared
the
chance
of
a
that
must
be
nothing
save
a
bore
i
maintain
that
this
is
not
in
the
least
degree
true
that
those
who
have
been
married
many
years
have
far
more
in
common
far
more
to
say
to
each
other
than
the
young
folks
just
starting
on
journey
can
possibly
have
to
say
and
that
the
yearly
holiday
taken
together
does
more
to
make
the
domestic
car
move
along
gracefully
and
lightly
than
anything
else
i
know
the
wife
is
relieved
from
the
unceasing
ordering
of
the
dinner
and
planning
of
everything
while
the
husband
once
more
finds
himself
responsible
for
all
the
little
details
and
delights
once
again
to
have
his
wife
to
himself
and
to
look
after
and
wait
upon
as
in
the
days
of
old
while
the
children
are
safe
at
their
lessons
or
looking
after
the
house
in
their
absence
and
once
more
there
is
a
real
holiday
feeling
in
the
air
and
they
can
fancy
themselves
young
and
starting
on
journey
over
again
there
is
nothing
so
amusing
to
me
as
the
discovery
that
daughters
and
sons
have
no
idea
that
their
father
and
mother
can
really
want
to
be
alone
together
or
that
they
can
possibly
prefer
each
society
to
that
of
their
friends
or
their
own
children
but
my
dear
young
people
it
is
the
case
and
though
of
course
your
parents
are
always
delighted
to
have
you
with
them
they
do
occasionally
wish
to
be
alone
together
the
yearly
holiday
allows
for
that
as
does
an
occasional
holiday
together
during
the
year
and
these
holidays
should
never
be
forgotten
or
omitted
they
should
be
kept
up
vigorously
and
no
blandishments
from
our
children
should
be
allowed
to
break
in
upon
the
Ã 
the
should
be
taken
together
or
not
at
all
and
now
reluctantly
and
regretfully
i
must
say
farewell
to
those
with
whom
i
have
conversed
so
long
in
these
pages
i
feel
this
book
has
not
the
gaiety
with
which
angelina
and
edwin
plan
out
their
life
and
with
which
they
start
out
to
furnish
their
little
home
in
kitchen
to
garret
but
if
i
am
more
serious
here
it
is
because
life
grows
more
serious
as
one
grows
older
as
one
realises
how
much
there
is
to
do
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
steer
the
bark
freighted
with
children
and
with
more
money
to
be
spent
judiciously
a
larger
house
to
be
managed
so
that
we
may
do
as
much
good
as
we
possibly
can
so
that
it
may
give
as
much
happiness
to
as
many
as
can
be
managed
and
in
some
measure
so
exist
as
to
leave
the
world
immediately
within
its
influence
just
a
little
bit
better
than
we
found
it
we
must
realise
wherever
we
are
that
we
influence
someone
perhaps
very
many
people
either
for
good
or
for
evil
it
is
no
use
to
bury
our
heads
in
the
sand
and
pretend
that
no
one
need
be
influenced
by
us
unless
they
like
and
that
it
is
not
our
fault
if
they
are
it
is
our
fault
and
we
can
not
get
rid
of
our
responsibility
in
this
way
while
if
we
boldly
accept
our
fate
and
do
our
duty
manfully
we
shall
have
our
reward
more
especially
if
we
endeavour
not
to
know
the
people
because
we
crave
for
social
exaltation
and
to
mix
with
those
who
resent
our
intrusion
and
laugh
at
our
pretensions
but
to
associate
with
those
whose
noble
minds
and
good
thoughts
and
bright
intellects
will
help
our
own
and
assist
us
on
our
mental
progress
through
the
world
and
to
have
as
friends
not
those
who
can
give
us
dinner
for
dinner
ball
for
ball
but
those
to
whom
we
can
give
pleasure
they
would
never
have
did
we
refuse
to
open
our
doors
to
them
and
to
those
whose
large
hearts
and
brilliant
minds
influence
ours
for
good
and
lead
us
insensibly
along
a
path
of
peace
and
safety
the
truest
socialism
should
begin
in
the
perfect
home
the
socialism
which
shares
or
administers
but
does
not
disperse
or
destroy
the
socialism
which
opens
the
park
gates
to
the
poor
or
the
to
those
who
could
never
see
anything
were
it
not
for
the
action
of
the
owner
that
never
receives
a
benefit
without
in
some
measure
sharing
it
with
a
poorer
brother
and
that
finally
has
a
noble
end
in
life
nay
the
noblest
of
all
that
of
leaving
the
world
a
little
better
for
having
lived
and
loved
and
worked
and
suffered
in
it
by
these
rules
should
the
home
be
formed
in
these
paths
should
the
children
be
led
who
should
never
be
allowed
for
one
moment
to
despise
those
they
may
consider
below
them
in
the
social
scale
who
should
always
be
taught
to
share
their
flowers
their
shells
their
holidays
and
pleasures
with
others
and
who
should
one
and
all
be
brought
up
to
do
something
in
life
something
to
assist
the
toiling
millions
around
us
something
to
do
good
to
someone
besides
themselves
of
course
this
is
hard
and
anxious
work
work
could
we
have
realised
it
was
before
us
when
we
so
lightly
accepted
our
fate
and
laid
together
the
foundations
of
a
new
home
we
might
never
have
found
courage
to
take
up
but
it
is
the
work
set
before
every
married
man
and
woman
in
the
world
they
can
either
accept
it
or
reject
it
but
if
they
do
leave
it
alone
the
undone
work
will
bring
its
own
punishment
in
the
unhappy
wicked
children
and
the
wrecked
and
miserable
home
that
will
take
the
place
of
that
which
might
have
been
the
home
which
is
the
rule
not
the
exception
in
england
and
that
we
can
all
have
if
we
have
powers
of
endless
work
in
us
and
realise
from
experience
what
is
before
us
all
then
when
the
curtain
falls
when
the
hands
part
which
have
held
each
other
so
fondly
so
faithfully
all
through
the
journey
the
worst
parts
of
which
have
been
gilded
by
the
unfailing
love
which
is
best
gift
the
one
who
goes
can
go
boldly
into
the
darkness
content
to
leave
all
to
that
higher
power
who
has
helped
them
so
gallantly
all
through
the
struggle
while
the
one
who
stays
knows
that
the
link
still
binds
them
together
and
will
draw
them
some
day
back
to
each
other
again
when
love
can
do
this
when
love
can
build
maintain
and
keep
our
homes
together
as
love
does
and
as
only
love
can
who
shall
dare
to
sneer
and
laugh
at
it
and
looking
at
such
homes
dare
ask
sarcastically
if
marriage
be
a
failure
marriage
never
is
never
can
be
a
failure
if
the
home
is
a
true
home
not
an
abode
of
vanity
an
entertaining
house
for
gaiety
and
waste
and
it
is
to
help
others
just
a
little
more
from
my
own
experience
of
the
happiest
of
all
homes
my
own
that
i
have
written
this
other
book
about
the
household
and
all
that
appertains
to
it
which
i
now
leave
to
my
good
friends
and
readers
content
to
feel
that
they
will
read
me
kindly
knowing
of
old
how
kind
they
can
be
to
one
who
has
said
