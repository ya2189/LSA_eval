added

an
improvement
to
boiled
veal
roasting
meat
roasting
either
meat
or
poultry
requires
more
attention
than
boiling
or
stewing
it
is
very
important
to
baste
it
frequently
and
if
the
meat
has
been
frozen
it
should
have
time
to
thaw
before
cooking
beef
veal
or
mutton
that
is
roasted
in
a
stove
or
oven
requires
more
flour
dredged
on
it
than
when
cooked
before
the
fire
in
a
tin
kitchen
there
should
be
but
little
water
in
the
dripping
pan
as
that
steams
the
meat
and
prevents
its
browning
it
is
best
to
add
more
as
the
water
evaporates
and
where
there
is
plenty
of
flour
on
the
meat
it
incorporates
with
the
gravy
and
it
requires
no
thickening
add
a
little
seasoning
before
you
take
up
the
gravy
meat
that
has
been
hanging
up
some
time
should
be
roasted
in
preference
to
boiling
as
the
fire
extracts
any
taste
it
may
have
acquired
to
rub
fresh
meat

salt

prevent
the
flies
from
troubling
it

will
make
it
keep
longer

roast
a
turkey

three
hours
to
roast

oven
wash
the

very
clean

will
boil
in
half
that
time
most
persons
prefer

boiled
with

pot
should
be
well
skimmed
before

penetrate
the
cabbage

make
it
unwholesome
take
it
up

pieces
it
is
very
good
boiled

a
little
salt

some
like
it
with

should
be
kept
at
this
point
to
bake
a
loaf
if
you
wish
to
make

it
will
take
three

not
so
near
that

lid
on
when
it
is
on

that
it
does
not
bake
too
fast
it
should
have
but
little
heat
at

bottom
and
the
coals
on
the
top
should
be
renewed
frequently
turn
the

round
occasionally
if
baked
slowly
it
will
take
an
hour
and
a
half
when
done
wrap
it
in
a
large
cloth
till
it
gets
cold
to
bake
in
a
brick
oven
if
you
have
a
large
family
or
board
the
laborers
of
a
farm
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
brick
oven
so
as
to
bake
but
twice
a
week
and
to
persons
that
understand
the
management
of
them
it
is
much
the
easiest
way
if
you
arrange
every
thing
with
judgment
half
a
dozen
loaves
of
bread
as
many
pies
or
puddings
rusk
rolls
or
biscuit
may
be
baked
at
the
same
time
some
persons
knead
up
their
bread
over
night
in
winter
to
do
this
the
sponge
should
be
made
up
at
four
in
the
afternoon
if
you
wish
to
put
corn
flour
in
your
bread
scald
one
quart
of
it
to
six
loaves
and
work
it
in
the
flour
that
you
are
going
to
stir
in
the
rising
to
make
six
loaves
of
bread
you
should
have
three
quarts
of
water
and
a
of
yeast

to
rise
very
much

well
boiled
and
rolled
fine
with
a
on
your
cake
board
mix
them
well
in
the
rising
after
it
is
light
if
the
oven
is
not
ready
move
the
bread
to
a
cool
place
if
the
bread
is
sour
before
you
mould
it
out
mix
a
heaped
of
salaeratus
in
a
little
water
spread
out
the
bread
on
the
board
dust
a
little
flour
on
it
and
spread
the
salaeratus
and
water
over
and
work
it
well
through
this
quite
takes
away
the
sour
taste
but
if
the
bread
is
made
of
good
lively
yeast
it
seldom
requires
it
let
it
rise
in
the
pans
about
half
an
hour
many
persons
that
make
their
own
bread
are
in
the
constant
practice
of
using
salaeratus
putting
in
the
rising
for
six
loaves
a
heaped
dissolved
in
a
little
warm
water
in
this
there
is
no
disadvantage
and
it
insures
sweet
bread
and
will
also
answer
in
making
rolls
or
light
cakes
common
sized
loaves
will
bake
in
an
hour
in
the
brick
oven
if
they
slip
easily
in
the
pans
and
upon
breaking
a
little
piece
from
the
side
it
rises
from
the
pressure
of
the
finger
it
is
done
but
if
it
should
not
rise
put
it
back
again
when
the
bread
is
taken
out
of
the
oven
wrap
it
in
a
cloth
till
quite
cold
you
should
have
a
large
tin
vessel
with
holes
in
the
top
to
keep
bread
in
in
this
way
it
will
be
moist
at
the
end
of
the
week
in
cool
weather
coarse
brown
flour

the
quickest
if

have
biscuit
to
bake
put
some
of
the
coals
on

as
they
require
a
quick
heat
and
should
be
put

first
and
then
the
pies
if

very
often
before

than
to
have
accomplished
what
is
called
a
good
baking
graham
bread
take
six
quarts
of
unbolted
flour
one
of
good
yeast
and
six
spoonsful
of
molasses
mix
them
with
a
pint
of
milk
warm
water
and
a
of
salaeratus
make
a
hole
in
the
flour
and
stir
this
mixture
in
it
till
it
is
like

then
proceed
as
with
fine
flour
mould
it
when
light
into
four
loaves
have
your
oven
hotter
than
for
other
bread
and
bake
it
fully
one
hour
and
a
half
it
is
an
excellent
article
of
diet
for
dyspeptic
and
sedentary
persons
dyspepsy
bread
this
is
unbolted
flour
and
the
remaining
fourth
common
flour
and
is
risen
and
made
as
other
light
bread
but
should
be
baked
rather
more
yeast
it
is
important
to
those
that
make
their
own
bread
to
make
their
own
yeast
or
they
can
not
judge
of
its
strength
the
best
is
the
hop
yeast
which
will
keep
for
six
weeks
in
winter
put
a
pint
of
hops
in
a
pot
with
a
quart
of
water
cover
it
tightly
and
let
it
boil
slowly
for
half
an
hour
strain
it
while
boiling
hot
on
a
pint
of
flour
and
a
heaped
of
salt
stir
it
well
and
let
it
stand
till
nearly
cool
when
put
in
a
of
good
yeast
if
it
is
not
sweet
put
in
a
little
salaeratus
just
as
you
stir
it
in
keep
it
in
a
warm
place
till
it
rises
when
put
it
in
a
stone
jug
and
cork
it
tightly
keep
it
in
a
cool
place
in
summer
but
do
not
let
it
freeze
in
winter
shake
it
before
you
use
any
when
your
yeast
jug
is
empty
fill
it
with
water
and
let
it
soak
wash
it
well
and
if
it
should
smell
sour
rinse
it
with
salaeratus
water
if
you
have
a
garden
raise
your
own
hops
by
all
means
pick
them
by
the
first
of
september
or
they
will
lose
their
strength
dry
them
on
sheets
spread
on
the
garret
floor
if
you
buy
hops
choose
light
green
ones
with
the
yellow
dust
about
them
brown
hops
have
generally
stayed
too
long
on
the
vines
another
method
put
two
handsful
of
hops
into
three
pints
of
water
let
it
boil
to
one
quart
when
cold
strain
it
on
to
a
pint
of
best
flour
a
of
salt
half
a
pint
of
molasses
and
a
of
good
yeast
as
it
rises
skim
off
the
top
several
times
when
the
yeast
looks
white
bottle
it
up
tight
and
it
will
keep
for
several
weeks
corn
flour
dry
yeast
put
a
large
handful
of
good
hops
in
a
quart
of
water
cover
it
close
and
let
it
boil
nearly
half
away
when
strain
it
over
corn
flour
it
must
all
be
wet
but
not
so
soft
as
for
bread
put
in
a
large
spoonful
of
salt
and
mix
it
well
when
about
milk
warm
put
in
two
of
yeast
observe
that
the
yeast
is
lively
rub
it
through
with
your
hands
it
must
be
so
stiff
as
just
to
stick
together
set
it
in
a
warm
place
to
rise
which
it
should
do
in
a
few
hours
when
light
rub
in
more
corn
flour
and
scatter
it
in
dishes
very
thin
or
put
it
on
a
cloth
on
a
large
waiter
spread
thinly
it
should
be
dried
quickly
or
it
may
turn
sour
either
in
the
sun
which
is
best
or
a
warm
stove
room
stir
it
over
frequently
when
perfectly
dry
cover
it
close
either
in
a
jar
or
wooden
box
and
keep
it
in
a
dry
closet
select
a
sunny
day
and
begin
early
in
the
morning
as
by
this
method
you
may
have
your
yeast
dry
by
night
half
a
is
enough
for
two
loaves
of
wheat
bread
it
should
be
soaked
in
water
some
minutes
before
using
it
and
it
is
generally
best
to
put
in
half
a
of
salaeratus
as
dry
yeast
is
more
apt
to
turn
sour
than
the
liquid
yeast
some
good
housekeepers
use
this
yeast
where
hops
are
scarce
and
it
answers
very
well
it
will
keep
good
six
weeks
or
two
months
potato
yeast
boil
four
large
potatoes
with
a
of
hops
tied
loosely
in
a
bag
mash
the
potatoes
in
a
pan
with
a
spoonful
of
salt
and
four
of
flour
pour
the
on
it
and
mix
all
together
when
nearly
cold
put
in
two
of
yeast
put
it
in
a
quart
jar
and
let
it
rise
it
will
do
to
use
in
five
or
six
hours
this
yeast
is
much
weaker
than
the
first
receipt
but
it
has
this
advantage
that
with
a
pint
of
it
you
may
knead
up
four
loaves
of
bread
at
night
without
making
rising
it
is
best
to
make
this
yeast
once
a
week
always
being
careful
to
have
the
jar
sweet
before
you
put
it
in
potato
yeast
with
sugar
to
about
a
quart
of
potatoes
boiled
and
made
thin
enough
with
warm
water
to
pass
through
a
sieve
add
when
cold

general
remarks
on
making
bread
of
indian
corn
meal
a
wooden
spoon
with
a
long
handle
is
the
best
for
stirring
and
mixing
the
bread
or
cakes
it
requires
more
salt
than
other
bread
and
should
be
well
mixed
or
beaten
if
it
is
mixed
over
night
it
should
generally
be
done
with
cold
water
and
set
in
the
cellar
or
some
cool
place
in
summer
in
winter
it
requires
rather
a
warmer
place
to
stand
it
sours
more
easily
than
bread
made
of
other
flour
in
the
morning
if
you
find
that
it
is
at
all
acid
dissolve
half
a
of
salaeratus
in
warm
water
and
stir
it
just
before
it
is
put
to
bake
where
milk
is
used
it
should
be
baked
immediately
and
the
richer
the
milk
the
more
palatable
it
is
whatever
you
bake
this
bread
in
should
be
well
greased
first
as
it
is
more
apt
to
adhere
to
the
oven
than
some
other
kinds
of
flour
it
should
bake
with
a
quick
heat
when
you
buy

pound
it
fine
put
it
in

bottle
and
cork

flour
put
in
some
salt
and
wet
it
with
water
make
it
so
that
it
can
just
be
rolled
out
when
you
have
put
in
the
fruit
wet
the
crust
with
water
put
on
the
top
and
close
it
up
stick
it
with
a
fork
on
the
top
to
stew
fruit
for
pies
all
fruits
that
are
not
fully
ripe
should
be
stewed
and
sweetened
to
boil
a
gallon
of
molasses
at
a
time
and
keep
it
to
sweeten
pies
is
cheaper
than
sugar
and
answers
a
very
good
purpose
where
there
is
a
large
family
when
fruit
is
fully
ripe
it
does
very
well
to
bake
in
pies
without
being
stewed
after
washing
the
dried
fruit
put
it
on
to
stew
in
a
kettle
over
the
fire
or
in
a
tin
pan
in
a
stove
let
it
have
plenty
of
water
as
it
swells
very
much
and
if
it
seems
dry
put
in
more
water
apples
take
longer
to
stew
than
peaches
and
should
have
more
water
fruit
stewed
in
this
way
is
very
good
to
put
on
the
table
to
eat
with
meat
do
not
stir
the
fruit
while
it
is
stewing
or
it
will
burn
dried
cherries
and
damsons
may
be
stewed
in
the
same
manner

the
right
thickness
if
the
cider
is
not
sweet
put
in
more
molasses
when
all
is
mixed
it
is
best
to
bake
a
small
pie
as
you
can
alter
the
seasoning
if
it
is
not
to
your
taste
if
you
have
not
raisins
dried
cherries
or
small
grapes
that
have
been
preserved
in

are
very
good
or
stewed
dried
apples
instead
of
green
and
where
you
have
no

stew
the
apples
in
plenty
of
water
so
as
to
have
them
very
soft
a
little
good
vinegar
sweetened
and
mixed
with
water
also
does
instead
of
cider
but
is
not
so
good
this
will
make
about
forty
pies
and
if
you
have
a
convenient
way
of
keeping
them
you
may
bake
all
at
once
as
they
will
keep
for
two
months
very
readily
when
the
weather
is
cold
if
you
do
not
bake
all
at

put

remarks
on
making
and
baking
cake
the
materials
for
making
cake
should
be
of
the
best
quality
as
your
success
very
much
depends
on
it
flour
should
be
dried
and
sifted
sugar
rolled
fine
spices
pounded
and
sifted
where
brown
sugar
is
used
it
should
be
spread
on
a
dish
and
dried
before
rolling
it
i
have
known
very
good
pound
cake
made
with
brown
sugar
also
jumbles
persons
that
make
their
own
butter
sometimes
use
it
fresh
from
the
churn
which
prevents
the
necessity
of
washing
the
salt
out
of
it
for
cake
and
it
mixes
more
readily
than
hard
butter
currants
should
be
picked
over
washed
and
dried
raisins
should
be
stemmed
and
stoned
when
these
preparations
are
made
the
day
before
it
is
a
great
assistance
eggs
should
be
fresh
or
they
will
not
beat
light
in
beating
the
whites
take
a
broad
flat
dish
and
beat
them
until
you
can
hold
the
dish
upside
down
this
is
a
test
of
their
lightness
a
large
bowl
is
best
for
mixing
and
beating
cake
you
must
use
your
hand
for
mixing
the
sugar
and
butter
and
as
you
add
the
other
ingredients
you
may
take
a
large
wooden
spoon
beat
it
some
time
after
all
is
mixed
the
oven
should
be
ready
to
bake
immediately
as
standing
makes
cake
heavy
a
brick
oven
is
the
most
certain
and
over
your
pans
of
cake
you
should
spread
several
layers
of
newspaper
to
prevent
its
browning
too
suddenly
cake
requires
more
time
than
bread
a
large
cake
should
stay
in
the
oven
from
an
hour
and
a
half
to
two
hours
turning
and
looking
at
it
from
time
to
time
when
you
think
it
is
sufficiently
baked
stick
a
broad
bright
knife
in
the
centre
if
it
is
dry
and
free
from
dough
when
drawn
out
the
cake
is
likely
to
be
done
though
sometimes
this
is
not
a
certain
test
and
you
will
have
to
draw
a
little
from
the
centre
of
the
cake
with
the
knife
a
broom
straw
will
sometimes
answer
in
a
small
cake
instead
of
a
knife
a
large
stone
pan
with
a
cover
is
the
best
for
keeping
cake
or
a
large
covered
bowl

another
way
it

as
would
fill

twice
have

up
stir

down
which
may
be
done
two

constantly
then
put
in
the
rest
of
the

as
fast
as
the

will
take
them
and
boil
it
four
hours
after
the
last
apples
are
put

you

so
that
nothing
acid
shall
come

in
the

put
the

on
slightly
so
as
to
hold
the
other
end
and
allow
air
sufficient
to
make
it
burn
when
the
rag
has
burned
out
drive
in
the
bung
to
keep
in
the
sulphuric
gas
which
if
allowed
time
will
condense
on
the
sides
the
apples
should
be
kept
under

and
secured
from

after
they
have
laid
to

for
two
or
three
weeks
select
those
that
are
sound
break
off
the

have
the

perfectly
clean
and
after
they
are
ground
keep
them
from
the
sun
and
rain
for
hours
then
press
them
and
fill
into
the
casks
the
first
running
is
always
the
best
each
cask
that
is
filled
should
be
numbered
so
as
to
know
the
quality
and
after
they
are
all
filled
draw
off
and
mix
them
the
weak
with
the
strong
keep
the
casks
filled
up
with
cider
while
they
are
fermenting
when
the
fermentation
is
subsiding
there
will
be
a
thin
white
scum
rise
slowly
when
this
is
all
off
lay
on
the
bung
lightly
rack
it
off
in
a
few
days
in
barrels
in
which
brimstone
has
been
used
and
bung
it
tight
rack
it
off
again
in
march
and
keep
the
bungs
in
tight
to
make
vinegar
you
may
always
have
good
vinegar
for
pickling
and
other
purposes
by
taking
a
little
pains
get
a
tight
whiskey
barrel
if
it
is
clean
you
need
not
rinse
it
and
put
into
it
ten
gallons
of
the
best
vinegar
you
can
procure
with
one
quart
of
whiskey
and
one
quart
of
molasses
every
day
for
a
week
add
a
gallon
of
good
cider
that
has
not
been
watered
and
shake
the
barrel
each
time
let
it
stand
in
this
state
two
weeks
shaking
the
barrel
frequently
after
this
you
may
put
in
a
gallon
of
cider
occasionally
with
any
that
has
been
left
at
table
or
the
settlings
of
decanters
or
bottles
that
have
had
wine
in
but
do
not
put
in
any
water
it
will
make
much
sooner
in
the
garret
or
a
warm
place
but
if
the
barrel
is
fixed
early
in
the
summer
you
will
have
plenty
to
pickle
with
in
the
fall
taste
it
so
as
not
to
add
cider
too
fast
have
a
phial
with
a
string
attached
to
it
that
you
can
put
in
at
the
bung
you
should
have
a
barrel
of
good
hard
cider
before
you
begin
to
make
vinegar
if
you
are
in
want
of
vinegar
fill
a
jug
from
the
barrel
and
set
it
in
the
hot
sun
where
it
will
turn
sour
much
quicker
it
is
a
good
plan
to
keep
a
jug
in
a
closet
where
you
can
empty
all
the
slops
of
cider
and
wine
and
when
you
get
it
full
empty
it
in
the
barrel
after
the
pickling
is
done
you
can
put
as
much
hard
cider
in
the
barrel
a
gallon
at
a
time
as
you
have
taken
out
with
a
little
molasses
and
half
a
pint
of
whiskey
if
you
put
too
much
of
the
latter
it
will
prevent
it
from
getting
sour
but
a
little
gives
strength
to
the
cider
and
the
molasses
increases
the
acidity
and
helps
to
color
it
if
you
should
have
any
juice
of
cherries
currants
or
blackberries
put
it
in
or
if
you
can
get
cheap
sour
raisins
they
will
be
an
improvement
to
the
flavor
of
the
vinegar
a
of
burnt
sugar
will
give
it
a
good
color
vinegar
made
in
this
way
will
keep
pickles
good
for
several
years
if
the
cider
has
not
sufficient
strength
it
will
take
longer
to
make
to
pickle
mangoes
pick
your

a
proper
age
before
they
get
too
hard
make
a
slit

had
not

some

use
crushed
charcoal
to

shoulders
are
more
easily
affected
than

and
if
the
weather
is
warm
the

should
be

preventive
where
flies
are
troublesome
have
a

pepper
is
also
good
to
put

it
does

of
about
three

made
of
coarse
salt
and
when
it
is
cold
pour
it
over
the
meat
and
put
a
weight
on
the
top
if
you
wish
pork
to
keep
do
not
put

then
hang
it
up
and
smoke
it
with
green
hickory
wood
for
three
weeks
if
there
is
a
damp
spell
of
weather
it
is
best
to
make
a
fire
in
your
occasionally
through
the
summer
to
keep
the
meat
from
moulding
to
make
a
pickle
for
chines
rub
the
chines
with
fine
salt
and
pack
them
in
a
tight
barrel
make
a
pickle
of
coarse
salt
strong
enough
to
bear
an
egg
boil
and
skim
it
and
when
nearly
cold
pour
it
on
let
there
be
enough
to
cover
them
and
put
a
weight
on
the
top
chines
are
good
smoked
it
is
best
to
make
a
separate
pickle
for
the
heads
wash
and
scrape
them
cut
off
the
ears
and
noses
and
take
out
the
eyes
the
jowls
may
be
packed
and
smoked
with
the
bacon
sausage
meat
separate
the
tender
parts
of
the
meat
from
the
rough
and
bony
pieces
and
chop
each
sort
separately
to
pounds
of
meat
have
half
a
pound
of
salt
three
heaped
of
sage
three
of
pepper
and
two
of
thyme
if
you
have
a
box
large
enough
to
hold
this
quantity
sprinkle
it
over
the
meat
before
it
is
chopped
and
it
will
be
thoroughly
mixed
by
the
time
it
is
done
it
is
best
to
have
a
small
piece
fried
to
taste
and
if
it
is
not
seasoned
right
it
can
be
altered
you
should
have
some
pieces
of
fat
chopped
in
with
the
meat
the
sage
and
thyme
should
be
carefully
dried
but
not
heated
too
much
neither
should
it
be
hung
up
too
near
the
fire
as
it
would
spoil
the
flavor
rub
it
through
a
wire
sifter
and
if
that
should
not
make
it
fine
enough
pound
it
in
a
mortar
or
grind
it
in
your
pepper
mill
the
pepper
should
be
ground
and
ready
some
days
before
it
is
needed
as
the
pork
season
in
the
country
is
while
it
lasts
one
of
the
busiest
in
the
year
every
thing
should
be
prepared
beforehand
that
you
possibly
can
it
is
a
good
plan
to
have
plenty
of
bread
and
pies
baked
and
a
quantity
of
apples
stewed
vegetables
washed
and
ready
to
cook
so
that
every
member
of
the
family
that
is
able
may
devote
herself
to
the
work
of
putting
away
the
meat
which
is
of
so
much
importance
for
the
coming
year
while
some
are
cutting
up
the
fat
to
render
into
lard
others
may
be
employed
in
assorting
the
sausage
meat
and
cutting
it
into
small
pieces
for
the
chopping
machine
by
trimming
off
every
part
that
can
be
spared
you
can
have
one
hundred
pounds
of
sausage
from
twelve
hundred
weight
of
pork
and
since
the
introduction
of
sausage
choppers
a
great
deal
more
sausage
is
made
than
formerly
by
the
old
method
clean
a
few
of
the
maws
and
soak
them
in
salt
and
water
and
fill
them
with
sausage
meat
sew
them
close
let
them
lay
in
pickle
for
two
weeks
then
hang
them
up
and
when
your
meat
is
smoked
let
them
have
a
few
days
smoke
in
this
way
sausage
will
keep
all
summer
and
is
very
nice
when
boiled
slowly
for
several

to
hang
up
by
lay
the
pieces
in
a
tub
of
cold
water
for
an
hour
then
rub
each
piece
of
beef
that
will
weigh
fifteen
or
twenty
pounds
with
a
handful
of
brown
sugar
and
a
of
saltpetre
pulverized
and
a
pint
of
fine
salt
sprinkle
fine
salt
in
the
bottom
of
a
clean
tight
barrel
and
lay
the
pieces
in
strewing
a
little
coarse
salt
between
each
piece
let
it
lay
two
days
then
make
the
brine
in
a

top
of
the
meat
to
keep
it
under
the
pickle
which
is
very
important
put
a
cover
on
the
barrel
examine
it
occasionally
to
see
that
the
pickle
does
not
leak
and
if
it
should
need
more
add
of
the
same
strength
let
it
stand
six
weeks
then
hang
it
up
in
the
smoke
house
and
after
it
has
drained
smoke
it
moderately
for
ten
days
it
should
then
hang
in
a
dry
place
before
cooking
let
it
soak
for
twenty
four
hours

one
hour
and
a
small
piece
should
soak
six

twelve
hours
according
to
size
beef
cured
in
this
way
will
make
a

or
put
between
slices
of
bread

rub
the
meat
well
with

to
restore
meat
that
has
been
kept

long
when
meat
has
been

wash
it
well
in
cold
water
several
times
if
it
lays
all

to
keep
meat
fresh
where
persons
live
a
distance
from
market
and
have
no
fresh
meat
but
what
they
kill
it
is
important
to
know
how
to
keep
it
fresh
in
winter
if
it
is
hung
up
in
an
it
will
keep
very
well
for
six
weeks

it
is
safe
till
a

comes
on
when

have
an
you
can
keep
it
without
trouble
if
rubbed
with

it
will
keep
good
a
week
in
hot
weather
to
put
up
herring
and
shad
those
that
put
up
their
own
fish
should
be
careful
to
have
the
barrels
tight
and
well
cleaned
if
the
pickle
leaks
from
them
they
are
liable
to
spoil
scale
the
fish
and
wash
them
as
it
will
save
much
time
when
you
prepare
them
for
cooking
take
out
the
gills
but
leave
on
the
heads
of
herrings
the
heads
should
be
taken
off
the
shad
and
split
them
down
the
back
put
a
layer
of
fish
then
a
layer
of
ground
alum
salt
and
after
they
are
packed
put
on
a
weight
to
keep
them
down
if
herring
are
well
cured
they
will
be
good
at
the
end
of
two
years
to
put
up
herring
to
the
harford
first
put
the
herring
into
the
brine
left
from
curing
bacon
or
if
you
have
none
of
that
description
make
a
brine
that
will
bear
an
egg
and
let
them
remain
in
it
thirty
or
forty
hours
then
if
for
pickled
herring
change
them
into
new
brine
which
must
also
bear
an
egg
and
head
them
up
to
keep
if
for
red
herring
hang
them
up
and
smoke
them
thoroughly
a
little
saltpetre
added
to
the
brine
is
an
improvement
it
is
better
to
take
out
the
roe
butter
cheese
coffee
tea
butter
it
is
of
the
first
importance
that
every
thing
connected
with
milk
and
butter
should
be
kept
clean
if
the
milk
acquires
an
unpleasant
taste
it
communicates
it
to
the
butter
tin
pans
are
best
to
keep
milk
in
and
they
should
be
painted
on
the
outside
to
keep
them
from
rusting
when
they
are
put
in
water
in
summer
milk
should
be
kept
as
cool
as
possible
before
it
is
strained
the
pans
and
strainer
should
be
rinsed
with
cold
water
and
the
milk
not
covered
until
it
is
cold
as
soon
as
the
cream
rises
sufficiently
it
should
be
skimmed
and
put
in
a
large
tin
bucket
with
a
lid
that
fits
down
tight
and
stirred
every
day
butter
will
be
spoiled
by
neglecting
to
stir
the
cream
a
yellow
scum
will
form
on
it
which
gives
it
an
unpleasant
taste
and
if
you
leave
a
pan
of
milk
till
the
cream
is
covered
with
spots
of
mould
you
had
better
throw
it
away
than
put
it
in
as
it
will
spoil
the
taste
of
a
whole
churning
if
you
have
no
way
of
keeping
your
cream
cool
in
hot
weather
it
ought
to
be
churned
twice
a
week
the
earlier
in
the
morning
the
better
always
put
cold
water
in
your
churn
the
night
before
you
use
it
and
change
it
in
the
morning
just
before
you
put
in
the
cream
when
the
butter
is
gathering
take
off
the
lid
of
the
churn
to
let
the
heated
air
escape
and
move
it
gently
have
your
butter
ladle
and
pan
scalded
and
cooled
take
out
the
butter
and
work
it
till
all
the
milk
is
out
scrape
some
lumps
of
salt
and
work
in
cover
it
up
and
set
away
in
a
cool
place
till
the
next
morning
when
work
it
again
if
you
have
neither
an
ice
or
spring
house
a
box
by
the
side
of
the
pump
with
a
cover
over
it
is
very
convenient
to
put
cream
and
butter
down
the
well
put
them
in
tin
kettles
with
covers
to
fit
tight
and
fasten
them
to
strong
tarred
ropes
twenty
feet
long
the
air
of
a
well
will
keep
butter
sweet
for
several
weeks
in
the
hottest
weather
it
is
best
to
have
one
kettle
or
basket
to
put
the
butter
in
that
is
used
at
the
table
it
should
be
deep
enough
to
hold
five
or
six
plates
each
covered
with
a
saucer
it
can
be
kept
in
this
way
as
firm
and
sweet
as
in
an
ice
house
you
can
have
a
separate
kettle
to
put
a
large
lump
of
butter
in
for
seasoning
vegetables
if
you
print
butter
for
home
use
it
is
not
necessary
to
weigh
it
make
it
out
in
little
lumps
that
will
weigh
about
half
a
pound
scald
the
print
and
ladle
and
put
them
in
cold
water
as
you
print
each
lump
lay
it
on
a
dish
in
winter
it
is
more
difficult
to
have
good
butter
as
much
depends
on
the
food
of
the
cows
the
milk
should
be
kept
in
a
cellar
where
it
will
not
freeze
if
you
have
a
safe
to
keep
it
in
it
need
not
be
covered
cream
takes
much
longer
to
rise
in
winter
after
it
has
stood
two
days
to
put
it
on
the
top
of
a
moderately
heated
stove
will
assist
it
when
it
is
hot
set
it
away
to
skim
the
next
day
when
the
cream
will
be
thick
and
rich
and
churns
easier
if
the
weather
is
very
cold
and
the
cream
has
been
chilled
have
a
large
pot
of
water
over
the
fire
set
in
the
bucket
when
it
is
near
boiling
heat
and
keep
stirring
till
it
is
milk
warm
have
the
churn
scalded
and
put
it
in
by
churning
steadily
it
will
come
as
quick
as
in
summer
one
good
working
answers
very
well
for

will
keep
good
till
spring
it
should
be
tied

that
will
keep
for
a
length
of
time
reduce
separately
to
a
fine
powder
two
pounds
of
the
best
fine
salt
one
pound
of

sugar
and
half
a
pound
of
saltpetre
sift
these
ingredients
one
above

large
sized
sheet
of

then
mix
them
well
together
keep
this
mixture
covered
up
close
in

and
placed
in

dry
closet
when
your

it
well
into
the
mass
butter
cured
in
this
way
it
is
said
will
keep
good
for
several
years
i
have
never
kept
it
longer
than
from
the
fall
until
late
in
the
spring
it
was
then
very
sweet
and
good
it
will
not
do
to
use
for
a
month
because
earlier
the
salts
will
not
be
sufficiently
blended
with
it
it
should
be
kept
in
wooden
vessels
or
nice
stone
jars
jars
are
not
suitable
for
butter
as
during
the
decomposition
of
the
salts
they
corrode
the
glazing
and
the
butter
becomes
rancid
and
unhealthy
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
lady
of
much
experience
remarked
on
reading
the
above
this
is
an
admirable
receipt
and
by
attention
to
its
directions
butter
may
be
packed
away
with
success
even
in
the
summer
months
thus
in

during
warm
weather

is
often
cheap
a

then
purchase

winter
supply
select
that
which
is
sweetest
and
most
firm
begin
by
putting
a
layer
of
the
prints
in
the
bottom
of
a
stone
pot
press
the
butter
down
close
so
that
no
cavities
for
the
admission
of
air
may
remain
then
strew
more
of
the
mixture
over
it
proceed
in
this
manner
until
the
vessel
is
filled
when
put
on
the
top
a
small
muslin
bag
filled
with
salt
and
tie
the
jar
up
close
it
is
very
important
to
keep
the
butter
in
a
cool
place
a
great
deal
depends
on
the
butter
being
well
worked
persons
that
have
large
dairies
should
always
have
a
machine
to
work
it
a
large

may
be
more
effectually
cleared
of
the

a
few
minutes
than
in
the
old
way

it
quickly
it

and
let
them
come
to

or
three
pounds
each
have

cold
pour
it
over
and
put

top
with
a
weight
on
it
to
keep
the

under
tie
it
up
close
and
keep
it
in
a
cold
place
when
a
roll
is
wanted
take
it
out
of
the

and
slice
it
off
for

use
it
should
be
put
on
little
plates
and
each
covered
with
a
saucer
to
exclude
the

if
the
butter
is
good
when
put
up
in
the
fall
it
will
keep
till
you
can
get
grass

persons
living
in
the
country
sometimes
have
more
milk
than
they
can
use
of
which
cheese
may
be
made
put
four
gallons
of
new
milk
in
a
clean
tub
that
is
kept
for
the
purpose
skim
your
night
milk
and
put
two
gallons
of
it
over
the
fire
when
it
is
near
boiling
put
it
in
the
tub
with
the
new
milk
and
the
rest
of
the
night
milk
it
should
be
rather
more
than
milk
warm
if
it
is
too
warm
the
cheese
will
have
a
strong
taste
the
day
before
you
make
cheese
put
a
piece
of
rennet
three
inches
square
in
a
of
water
and
stir
it
in
the

begins
to
form
cut
it
in
squares
with
a
long
wooden
knife
and
spread
a
thin

it
moderately
about
half
an
hour
then
put
it
back
in
the
tub
and
salt
it
to
your
taste
mix
it
well
and
if
you
want
it
very
rich
put
in
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
butter
it
is
always
better
to
skim
the
night
milk
and
put
in

as
the
cream
is
apt
to
press
out
have
a
clean
cloth
in

put
in

close
it
over
and
put
on
the
cover
if
you
have
no

press
a
heavy
stone
will
answer
the
purpose
press
it
very
gently
at
first
to
keep
the
richness
from
running
out
the
next
morning
draw

set
it
where
the
mice
and
flies
will
not

dust
it
over
with

it
is
fit
for
use
in
two
weeks
cheese
made
in
this
way
has
a
rich
mild
taste
and
most
persons
are
fond
of
it
if
you
get
eight
gallons
of
milk
a
day
you
may
make
cheese
twice
a
week
and
still
have

change
it
from
one
plate
to
another
twice
a
day
and
it
will
be
fit
for
use
in
less
than
a
week
to
prepare
rennet
for
making

when
the
rennet
is
taken
from

wash
it
lay
it
on

well
covered
with
salt
put
more
on
in
two
days
keep
it
in
a
cold
place
in
three
or
four
days
it
will
do
to
stretch

hang
it
up
in

cool
place
with
as
much
salt
as
will
stick
to

paper
bag
and
hang
it
up
a
piece
two
inches
square
soaked
in
two
of
water
will
make
a
cold
custard
the

piece
salted
and
dried
will
do
several
times
cottage
cheese
or
smearcase
the
best
plan
of
making
this
dish
is
to
set
the
tin
pan
of
clabber
on
a
hot
stove
or
in
a
pot
of
water
that
is
boiling
over
the
fire
when
the
whey
has
risen
sufficiently
pour
it
through
a
colander
and
put
the
curd
or
cheese
away
in
a
cold
place
and
just
before
going
to
table
season
it
with
salt
and
pepper
to
your
taste
and
pour
some
sweet
cream
over
it
roasting
coffee
pick
out
the
stones
and
black
grains
from
the
coffee
and
if
it
is
green
let
it
dry
in
an
oven
or
on
a
stove
then
roast
it
till
it
is
a
be
careful
that
it
does
not
burn
as
a
few
burnt
grains
will
spoil
the
flavor
of
the
whole
white
coffee
need
not
be
dried
before
roasting
and
will
do
in
less
time
two
pounds
is
a
good
quantity
to
roast
for
a
small
family
the
whites
of
one
or
two
eggs
well
beaten
and
stirred
in
the
coffee
when
half
cold
and
well
mixed
through
it
are
sufficient
to
clear
two
pounds
and
is
the
most
economical
way
of
using
eggs
it
will
answer
either
for
summer
or
winter
some
persons
save
egg
shells
for
clearing
coffee
many
persons
use
coffee
roasters
but
some
old
experienced
housekeepers
think
that
the
fine
flavor
flies
off
more
than
when
done
in
a
and
constantly
stirred
if
you
are
careful
it
can
be
done
very
well
in
the
of
a
stove
let
the
coffee
get
quite
cold
and
put
it
away
either
in
a
canister
or
tight
box
and
keep
it
in
a
dry
place
coffee
may
be
roasted
in
a
in
a
brick
oven
after
the
bread
is
taken
out
there
will
be
heat
sufficient
put
about
two
pounds
in
a
pan
stir
it
a
few
times
it
will
roast
gradually
and
if
not
sufficiently
brown
finish
in
a
stove
or
before
the
fire
if
you
have
a
large
family
by
using
several
pans
six
pounds
of
coffee
can
thus
be
roasted
and
but
little
time
spent
on
it
boiling
coffee
a
large
of
unground
coffee
will
be
sufficient
for
six
persons
unless
they
take
it
very
strong
which
is
injurious
to
health
grind
it
and
put
it
in
the
tin
pot
with
half
a
of
cold
water
and
the
white
of
half
an
egg
shake
it
till
it
is
mixed
then
pour
boiling
water
on
it
and
let
it
stand
close
to
the
fire
and
just
come
to
a
boil
stir
it
and
do
not
let
it
boil
over
let
it
keep
at
boiling
heat
five
or
ten
minutes
then
take
it
from
the
fire
and
put
in
half
a
of
water
to
settle
it
let
it
stand
five
minutes
and
pour
it
off
if
you
wish
it
particularly
nice
strain
it
through
a
thin
linen
cloth
kept
for
the
purpose
keep
it
by
the
fire
till
it
goes
to

if
you
boil
coffee
too
long
the
aromatic
flavor
flies
off

always
be
sure
that
the
kettle
is
boiling
when
you
make

the
flavor

scald
the
pot
and
allow

for
each
person
let
green
tea
draw
by
the
fire
from
two

five
minutes
black
tea
should
draw
ten
minutes
and
is
much
more
suitable
for
delicate
persons
than
green
persons
with
weak
nerves
should
never
drink
strong

i
have
known
instances
of
persons
being
afflicted
with
violent
attacks
of
nervous
that
were
cured
by
giving
up
the
use
of
tea
and
coffee
altogether
and
their
general
health
was
also
improved
by
it
before
pouring
out

answer
have
your
laying
in
strong
ley
through
the
winter
put
a
gallon
of
this
in
a
large
pot
and
put
to
it
a
gallon
of
the
strongest
ley
let
it
boil
an
hour
stirring
it
often
then
put
in
two
gallons
more
of
strong
ley
when
this
has
boiled
put
in
weak
ley
till
the
pot
is
full
let
it
boil
an
hour
or
two
slowly
and
be
careful
that
it
does
not
go
over
cool
some
on
a
plate
and
if
thick
it
is
done
but
if
not
boil
it
longer
put
it
away
in
a
tight
barrel
and
prepare
to
make
more
soap
if
you
have
two
large
pots
both
of
them
can
be
kept
going
at
the

time
several
barrels
of

can
be
made
from
one

stand
a
large
oil
cask
is
good
to
keep
soap
in
if
a
barrel
leaks
set
it
under

spout
in
a
rain
or
fill
it
with

it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
keep
the

have
an
oil
barrel
in
the
cellar
half
full
of
strong

and
put
in
cracklings
bacon
skins
pot
skimmings
beef
bones
or
any
scraps
when
eaten
by
ley
it
will
take
but
little
boiling
it
is
much
the
easiest
and
safest
way
where
there
are
children
to
make
the
soap
without
boiling
put
four
gallons
of
that
has
been
eaten
with

in
a
barrel
with
eight
gallons
of
strong
ley
stir
it
two
or
three
times
a
day
for
a
week
or
two
then
fill
it
up
with
weaker
ley
you
may
have
several
barrels
making
at
a
time
so
as
always
to
have
some
for
use
it
takes
some
time
to
make
it
in
this
way
but
if
you
are
careful
and
once
get
ahead
you
need
not
boil
the
soap
unless
you
prefer
it
so
if
your
ley
is
not
strong
dissolve
potash
in
hot
water
and
add
to
strengthen
it
hard

have
fifteen
pounds
of
clean

to
twenty
gallons
of

let
it
boil
until

when
put
in
half
a
peck
of
coarse
salt
if
it
does
not
curdle
in
two
hours
put
in
more
salt
till
it
does
then
pour
it
out
in
a

to
cool
till
the
next
day
when
put
on
your
pot
with
some
weak
ley
cut
the
soap
out
of
the

and
boil
it
in
this
an
hour
then
put
it
in
the

let
it
get
cold
cut
it
in
squares
and
put
it
on
a
board
to
dry
unless
you
have
plenty
of
ashes
and
it
is
much
cheaper
to
buy
hard
soap
than
to
make
it
if
you
have
but
a
barrel
full
of
ashes
you
can
make
a
barrel
of

bore
a

persons
living
in
cities
frequently
have
grease
that
would
do
to
make
soap
but
are
at
a
loss
for

in
consequence
of
burning
coal
instead
of

twelve
pounds
of
pure
grease
of
any
kind
put
with
ten
pounds
of
potash
in
an
oil
barrel
and
filled
with
water
makes
good
thick
soap
and
is
much
cheaper
than
buying
hard
soap
it
should
be
stirred
frequently
and
if
the
ingredients
are
put
together
in
warm
weather
and
the

stands
where
it
can
be
exposed
to
the
heat
of

about
ten

and
it
will
make
good
thick

in
a
few
hours
it
need
only
boil
long
enough
to
dissolve
the
potash
which
is
sometimes
in
very
hard
lumps
if
you
use
the
crumbled
potash
you
must
put
rather
more
of
it
as
it
is
not
so
strong
and
a

lump
of

lime
will
make

the
rubbing
required
in

or
to
carry
about
the
house
put
the
wicks
on
the
rods
the
day
before
you
expect
to
make
candles
and
dip
them
in
a
little
melted
tallow
you
can
then
straighten
them
out
have
a
large
pot
nearly
half
full
of
hot
water
melt
the
tallow
in
another
pot
and
fill
it
up
and
keep
more
tallow
at
the
fire
to
fill
in
as
it
is
used
out
put
coals
under
the
pot
to
keep
it
at
a
proper
heat
have
poles
set
on
stools
about
a
foot
apart
to
support
the

dip
the
rods
in

pot
alternately
until
they
are
as
large
as
you
wish
them
wax
makes
candles
burn
longer
but
turns
them
yellow
the
best
way
is
to
put
in
two
pounds
of
wax
when
you
first
begin
to
dip
and
it
will
be
used
up
before
they
are
dipped
the
last
time
when
they
are
done
cut
off
the
ends
and
put
them
in
boxes
most
good
managers
in
the
country
make
enough
candles
at
a
time
to
last
a
year
if
you
have
not
enough
tallow
to
dip
candles
you
can
mould
some
mutton
tallow
is
very
good

and
can
be
laid
by
in

care
should
be
taken
to
hang
them
to
dry
in
the
shade
as
that
will
keep
them
from
bleaching
new
table
cloths
do
not
require
any
starch
but
those
that
are
partly
worn
look
better
for
a
little
every
thing
washes
easier
that
has
starch
in
nice
table
cloths
and
all
fine
things
after
being
sprinkled
and
folded
should
be
tightly
rolled
up
in
towels
and
ironed
till
perfectly
dry
they
will
then
retain
their
gloss
large
table
cloths
should
be
brushed
clean
from
crumbs
and
folded
without
shaking
as
that
tumbles
them
those
in
daily
use
should
be
put
under
a
press
a
heavy
book
is
suitable
or
a
board
may
be
made
for
the
purpose
they
will
keep
in
credit
much
longer
than
when
laid
in
a
drawer
it
is
well
to
put
a
common
muslin
cloth
under
a
damask
one
on
the
table
as
it
improves
the
appearance
flannels
have
the
water
in
which
you
wash
flannel
as
hot
as
you
can
bear
your
hands
in
and
rub
the
soap
in
the
water
or
it
will
shrink
the
flannel
the
water
it
is
rinsed
in
should
also
be
hot
when
flannels
have
become
yellow
and
fulled
up
i
have
often
smoked
them
with
brimstone
and
they
will
be
as
white
as
new
and
the
fulled
places
will
open
the
best
plan
is
to
have
a
box
or
chest
with
strings
put
across
to
hang
the
flannels
on
and
a
drawer
to
pull
out
where
you
can
set
in
a
pan
with
coals
and
brimstone
have
the
flannels
nicely
washed
and
put
them
in
wet
close
it
up
till
you
think
it
wants
more
brimstone
when
you
can
pull
out
the
drawer
and
renew
it
after
they
are
bleached
they
should
hang
up
in
the
air
to
let
the
smell
of
the
brimstone
escape
if
you
have
but
a
few
things
to
do
you
can
put
strings
across
the
top
of
an
old
barrel
with
both
the
heads
out
cover
it
with
a
thick
cloth
and
lift
it
up
to
put
in
a
pan
of
brimstone
and
coals
always
wash
scarlet
flannel
with
hard
soap
mending
clothes
all
clothes
should
be
looked
over
before
they
are
put
away
and
if
any
require
mending
it
must
not
be
neglected
a
broken
stitch
that
can
be
mended
in
a
few
minutes
if
left
till
it
has
been
worn
again
will
require
much
more
time
if
young
housekeepers
suffer
their
mending
to
get
behind
hand
it
will
discourage
them
after
mending
a
shirt
it
should
be
pressed
before
it
is
put
away
if
stocking
heels
are
run
while
they
are
new
and
the
thin
places
darned
in
time
it
saves
much
work
washing
windows
a
little
soda
dissolved
in
the
water
is
valuable
for
washing
windows
do
not
let
it
run
on
the
sash
or
it
will
stain
the
paint
rinse
them
in
clear
water
and
wipe
dry
with
a
clean
soft
towel
when
they
are
but
little
soiled
clear
water
will
answer
but
if
smoked
or
coated
with
any
thing
soda
should
be
always
used
some
persons
rub
their
windows
with
soft
buckskin
or
newspaper
when
they
are
dry

clean

give

according
to
the
quantity
a
delicate

is
very
pretty
for

indigo
mixed
with
the
spanish
brown
makes
a
delicate
purple
or
alone
with
the

well
to
try
on

this
precaution
should
always
be
taken
before

have
tufts
or
two
pieces

it
should
be
tied

can
use
the
coarse

it

many
persons
are
deprived
of
one
of
the
greatest
comforts
in
summer
and
sleep
on
feathers
when
a
little
care
in
preparing
the
materials
and
putting
them
together
would
furnish
your
chambers
with
the
most
healthy
and
pleasant
beds
a
large
cotton
sheet
should
be
kept
on
a
matress
or
a
case
made
of
unbleached
muslin
this
covering
should
be
occasionally
washed
and
starched

garments
there
will
always
be
scraps
and
strips
by
purchasing
a
little
red
flannel
to
mix
in
the
appearance
is
improved
a
carpet
wears
cleaner
to
be
about
cotton
and
woollen
rags
to
mix
the
colors
do
not
sew
a
strip
that
is
longer
than
three
yards
and
the
cotton
should
be
much
shorter
as
the
warp
is
usually
of
that
material
there
is
more
danger
from
fire
to
keep
furs
and
woollens
crack
the
grains
of
black
pepper
and
sprinkle
in
among
your
furs
and
woollen
clothes
after
they
have
been
shaken
and
aired
fold
them
smooth
and
put
them
in
linen
bags
or
sheets
keep
them
in
a
large
trunk
or
dark
closet
and
look
at
them
once
through
the
summer
to
see
that
they
are
safe
tobacco
and
camphor
are
also
good
to
pack
them
in
but
the
smell
continues
with
them
a
long
time
and
is
disagreeable
to
some
persons
they
should
be
well
shaken
and
aired
before
they
are
worn
to
keep
curtains
take
the
curtains
down
in
the
spring
shake
them
carefully
and
brush
the
dust
from
them
let
them
air
a
day
but
not
so
that
the
sun
will
fade
them
then
fold
them
neatly
and
pin
them
up
in
sheets
moreen
or
worsted
curtains
require
the
same
care
as
woollen
cloths
to
keep
blankets
in
summer
if
you
have
any
blankets
that
are
soiled
and
require
washing
in
the
spring
have
it
nicely
done
when
they
are
perfectly
dry
put
them
on
a
bedstead
in
a
spare
chamber
keeping
out
one
to
use
on
each
bed
through
the
summer
spread
a
large
sheet
over
tuck
under
all
round
and
secure
the
corners
with
pins
tins
will
keep
them
from
dust
and
moths
and
makes
a
good
bed
to
use
in
hot
weather
carpets
when
you
take
up
carpets
in
the
spring
to
put
down
matting
have
them
well
shaken
and
if
there
are
any
spots
on
them
they
should
be
washed
off
with
a
stiff
brush
and
dried
if
there
is
oil
or
grease
spilt
on
them
mix
up
whiting
or
nice
clay
with
water
spread
it
on
both
sides
of
the
spot
and
baste
thick
paper
over
it
when
dry
fold
it
up
the
size
of
a
bedstead
and
pin
a
coarse
sheet
round
it
in
this
way
they
will
be
secure
from
moths
and
the
addition
of
a
few
quilted
comforts
on
the
top
makes
a
very
pleasant
bed
in
summer
the
small
appears
early
in
the
summer
and
should
always
be
destroyed
when
seen
as
the
moth
is
produced
from
the
eggs
which
they
deposit
in
woollens
by
being
careful
to
kill
them

then
take
as

is
very
good
to

bedsteads
in
the
summer
bedsteads
should
be
brushed
and
searched
every
week
if
they
are
infested
with
bugs
boil
the
sacking
in
ley
and
water
or
put
it
in
an
oven
on
some
boards
after
the
bread
is
taken

fill
a
large

pods
of
the
strongest
kind
and
fill
it
up
with
vinegar
put
this
in
each
crack
of
the
bedsteads
every
morning
until
they
entirely
disappear
never
omit
to
search
the
bedsteads
longer
than
a
week
it
is
a
good
way
to
fill
up
all
the
cracks
of
the
bedsteads
with
resin
soap
after
they
are
cleaned
move
the

sometimes
are
brought
in
the
cleanest
houses
before
the

should
always
be
examined
before
they
are
taken
into
the
chambers
or
put
away
a
little
care
at
the
proper
time
will
prevent
much
trouble
some
persons
scald
their
bedsteads
with
boiling
vinegar
the
acid
is
said
to
dissolve
the
shell
of
the
egg
if
poison
is
used
great
care
is
necessary
it
is
said
that
lard
is
good
to
use
on
bedsteads
that
are
infested
with
bugs
the
grease
prevents
their
increase
all
the
cracks
should
be
filled
after
the
bedstead
has
been
well
searched
to
clean
floors
scour
all
the
spots
with
soap
and
sand
then
go
all
over

rinse
it
well
and
wipe
it
dry
a
floor
that
has

not
trust
to

examine
and
see
that
it
is
done
thoroughly
the
apartments
where
cold
meat
and
milk
are
kept
should
be
cobwebbed
and
swept
once
a
week
and
the
safe
washed
out
at
least
that
often
if
the
cellar
is
paved
with
brick
keep
a
part
of
it
washed
clean
to
set
cold
meat
and
milk
on
cover
them
with
tin
pans
and
put
a
weight
on
the
top
if
rats
are
troublesome
if
there
are

holes
have
them
stopped
with
pieces
of

and
broken
glass

never
use
ratsbane
without
the
greatest
caution
as
it
is
a
dangerous
remedy
no
food
or
milk
should
be
in
the
cellar
at
the
time
and
keep
it
locked
up
all
the
while
it
is
there
i
have
heard
of
lives
being
lost
by
it
have
water
set
about
in
pans
for
the
rats
to
drink
and
after
three
days
clear
it
all
away
and
have
the
cellar
cleaned
and
aired
before
putting
any
thing
in
it
several
persons
have
been
in
great
danger
from
burning
the
arsenic
when
it
is
used
it
should
be
put
deep
in
the

are
kept
under

with
molasses
and
a
plate
on
the
top
with
room
for
them
to
get
in
and
set
it
close
to
a
wall
i
have
seen
hundreds
caught
in
this
way
in
one
night
and
it
is
much
safer
than
setting
any
thing
poisonous
about
the
kitchen
or
pantry
they
should
be
burnt
in
the
morning
and
the
dishes
set
again
at
night
if
you
find
a
closet
infested
with
ants
remove
every
thing
that
will
attract
them
scald
and
clean
it
well
and
they
will
soon
leave
it
it
is
said
that
strips
of
cotton
or
linen
dipped
in
spirits
of
turpentine
and
placed
about
the
closets
will
drive
them
away
mats
should
be
placed
at
all
the
outside
doors
and
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
cellar
stairs
putting
straw
under
carpets
it
is
thought
that
carpets
wear
better
when
straw
is
spread
over
the
floor
before
they
are
put
down
and
it
will
prevent
the
dust
from
rising
so
much
care
should
be
taken
to
have
them
well
tacked
down
as
it
is
dangerous
on
account
of
fire
where
straw
is
used
they
may
be
kept
down
a
much
longer
time
without
being
shaken
picking
geese
when
you
pick
geese
and
ducks
have
a
tub
of
boiling
water
dip
each
one
in
turning
it
over
to
let
every
part
be
well
scalded
and
as
each
one
is
scalded
wrap
it
up
in
a
cloth
and
when
they
are
nearly
cold
pick
them
in
this
way
the
pen
feathers
are
loosened
and
they
can
be
picked
much
cleaner
wetting
the
feathers
does
not
hurt
them
if
they
are
well
dried
they
should
be
put
in
bags
and
frequently
sunned
baking
them
in
the
oven
after
the
bread
comes
out
cures
them
more
thoroughly
than
any
other
way
turkey
and
chicken
feathers
are
not
so
good
for
beds
as
goose
and
duck
they
may
be
picked
in
the
same
way
marble
marble
mantles
should
be
washed
but
seldom
wipe
off

dry
hearths
should
be
washed
with
soap
and
water
when
there
is
a

will
restore

is
good
to
take

or
drops
of

out

apply
it
till
the

be
scraped
off
rub
french
chalk
or
magnesia
on
silk
or
ribbon
that
has
been
greased
and
hold
near
the
fire
this
will
absorb
the
grease
so
that
it
may
be
brushed
off
to
make
new
feather
beds
in
making
new
feather
beds
put
half
a
pound
of
cayenne
and
half
a
pound
of
black
pepper
in
each
bed
this
will
prevent
the
moths
from
getting
into
new
feathers
that
have
not
been
well
cured
it
is
best
to
air
your
beds
frequently
and
shake
them
up
even
if
they
are
not
slept
in
it
is
the
oil
in
the
feathers
that
makes
them
smell
bad
and
when
in
constant
use
the
heat
of
the
body
dries
it
up
gradually
when
beds
or
pillows
have
acquired
this
unpleasant
smell
open
them
and
put
a
few
pounded
cloves
in
each
when
new
beds
are
covered
with
cases
the
moth
will
sometimes
eat
through
without
its
being
discovered
covers
also
prevent
the
air
from
sweetening
the
feathers
and
when
new
they
should
never
be
covered
unless
in
use
when
beds
are
slept
on
it
is
best
to
have
a
thick
cotton
sheet
or
if
it
is
cold
weather
a
blanket
between
the
under
sheet
and
the
bed
and
have
them
washed
and
aired

rub

and
polish
it
with
a

another
way
is
to

it
is
very
well
to
put

several
hundred
to
use
in
the
winter
when
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
them
even
in
the
country
grease
each
egg
with
sweet
lard
and
as
you
do
so
lay
them
in
a
keg
or
jar
or
old
tin
vessels
that
are
out
of
use
put
them
in
a
dry
closet
and
keep
them
covered
over
if
they
are
put
in
the
cellar
they
are
liable
to
mould
which
spoils
them
entirely
do
not
put
in
any
cracked
ones
or
they
will
injure
the
rest
in
this
way
they
have
been
known
to
keep
a
year
and
were
nearly
as
good
for
puddings
or
batter
cakes
as
fresh
eggs
they
do
not
do
to
boil
or
make
pound
or
sponge
cake
as
they
lose
part
of
their
lightening
property
to
keep
eggs
in
lime
water
pour
two
gallons
of
hot
water
on
a
pint
of
lime
and
half
a
pint
of
salt
put
the
eggs
in
a
jar
or
keg
and
when
it
is
cold
pour
it
over
them
and
put
them
in
a
cellar
to
keep
be
sure
that
there
are
no
cracked
ones
eggs
may
be
kept
a
month
or
longer
spread
out
separately
on
dishes
so
as
one
will
not
lay
on
another
they
will
keep
best
in
a
dark
closet
to
clean
soiled
eggs
when
eggs
are
discolored
from
laying
on
the
ground
wash
them
first
in
strong
vinegar
and
then
in
cold
water
and
wipe
them

chloride
of
lime
a
few
spoonsful
of
chloride
of
lime
dissolved
in
some
water
in
a
bowl
or
saucer
is
very
useful
to
purify
the
apartment
of
an
invalid
or
in
any
case
where
there
is
an
unpleasant
smell
of
any
kind
it
is
a
cheap
article
and
should
always
he
kept
convenient
where
there
is
sickness
in
the
house
to
take
lime
out
of
cloth
lime
spots
on
woollen
clothes
may
be
effectually
removed
by
putting
a
little
strong
vinegar
on
the
part
which
completely
neutralizes
the
lime
and
does
not
usually
effect
the
color
but
it
will
be
safest
to
wash
it
over
with
a
cloth
dipped
in
water
and
rub
it
till
nearly
dry
hartshorn
and
alcohol
mixed
together
are
very
useful
in
taking
spots
out
of
cloth
or
merino
applied
with
something
that
will
not
leave
lint
to
take
wax
or
spermaceti
out
of
cloth
hold
a
red
hot
within
an
inch
or
two
of
the
cloth
and
this
will
make
the
wax
or
spermaceti
evaporate
entirely
then
rub
the
place
with
a
towel
that
is
free
from
lint
or
clean
brown
paper
to
remove
a
stopper
from
a
decanter
wet
a
cloth
with
hot
water
and
wrap
it
round
the
neck
of
the
bottle
this
will
cause
the
glass
to
expand
and
the
neck
will
be
enlarged
so
as
to
allow
of
the
stopper
to
be
withdrawn
without
any
trouble
precautions
against
fire
perhaps
it
may
not
be
improper
to
remark
that
houses
have
been
saved
from
being
destroyed
by
fire
at
night
by
there
having
been
buckets
of
water
left
in
the
kitchen
never
go
to
bed
without
seeing
that
there
is
a
supply
in
readiness
housekeepers
should
also
arrange
their
family
affairs
so
as
to
have
as
little
going
about
with
lights
by
servants
as
possible
chimneys
should
be
swept
at
proper
intervals
and
if
you
burn
them
let
it
be
on
a
rainy
morning
and
never
at
night
to
take
ink
and
stains
out
of
linen
dip
the
spotted
part
in
pure
melted
tallow
then
wash
out
the
tallow
and
the
ink
will
come
out
with
it
if
you
get
a
stain
of
fruit
of
any
kind
on
linen
boil
a
little
new
milk
and
dip
the
parts
in
and
out
for
a
few
minutes
this
must
be
done
before
any
water
is
used
or
it
will
not
be
likely
to
succeed
oxalic
acid
or
salt
and
lemon
juice
are
good
and
care
should
be
taken
to
rinse
the
articles
well
after
the
application
herbs
gardens
and
yards
if
you
have
a
garden
be
careful
to
raise
herbs
both
for
cooking
and
to
use
in
sickness
parsley
thyme
sage
and
sweet
marjoram
occupy
very
little
room
in
a
garden
and
can
not
very
well
be
dispensed
with
for
kitchen
use
and
every
family
should
have
a
bunch
of
wormwood
it
is
a
fine
tonic
either
made
while
fresh
cut
fine
with
cold
water
or
after
it
has
been
dried
made
with
boiling
water
tansey
is
also
a
useful
herb
hoarhound
is
excellent
for
coughs
and
is
particularly
useful
in
consumptive
complaints
either
as
a
syrup
or
made
into
candy
balm
is
a
cooling
drink
in
a
fever
catnip
tea
is
useful
when
you
have
a
cold
and
wish
to
produce
a
perspiration
and
is
good
for
infants
that
have
the
colic
garlic
is
good
for
colds
and
for
children
that
have
the
croup
you
should
have
some
taken
up
in
the
fall
to
use
through
the
winter
the
root
of
elecampane
gathered
in
the
fall
scraped
sliced
and
strung
with
a
needle
and
thread
to
dry
will
keep
its
strength
for
several
years
and
is
useful
for
a
cough
with
hoarhound
rue
is
a
valuable
herb
a
tea
made
of
it
and
sweetened
is
good
for
worms
it
is
not
expected
that
persons
living
in
a
town
should
have
room
in
their
garden
for
herbs
but
they
are
generally
to
be
purchased
at
market
and
should
always
be
kept
in
the
house
as
sometimes
in
the
winter
they
are
much
needed
when
it
is
difficult
to
find
them
herbs
should
be
spread
out
on
a
cloth
to
dry
turn
them
every
day
when
dry
put
them
in
thick
paper
bags
and
close
up
the
top
so
as
to
exclude
the
air
they
can
be
kept
hanging
up
or
laid
on
the
shelf
of
a
closet
where
they
will
not
be
affected
by
damp
such
herbs
as
sage
thyme
and
sweet
marjoram
when
thoroughly
dry
should
be
pounded
sifted
and
corked
in
bottles
parsley
should
be
cut
fine
with
a
pair
of
scissors
dried
and
put
in
bottles
it
is
nearly
as
good
this
way
as
when
fresh
keep
it
in
a
dark
closet
where
you
have
a
garden
do
not
throw
away
the
that
are
left
from
washing
as
they
are
very
good
to
water
herbs
and
flowers
it
is
very
important
to
have
early
vegetables
a
garden
that
is
spaded
or
ploughed
in
the
winter
is
ready
to
plant
much
earlier
there
are
many
things
that
will
bear
the
spring
frosts
without
injury
and
if
planted
early
will
be
ready
to
grow
when
the
fine
weather
comes
tomatoes
should
be
sowed
in
boxes
or
a
to
be
ready
to
transplant
the
scrapings
of
a
cellar
are
good
to
put
in
the
garden
to
enrich
it
ashes
sprinkled
on
a
yard
or
grass
plat
will
keep
down
the
coarse
grass
and
produce
white
clover
the
grass
should
be
cut
out
of
a
brick
pavement
with
a
knife
and
boiling
ley
poured
on
to
kill
the
roots
seeds
should
be
saved
as
they
ripen
from
the
finest

they
should
be
kept

they
will
do
to

you
have

and
should
be
kept
in
a

it
possesses
a
tendency
to

it
is
this
peculiar
quality
that
renders
it
useful
in

having
previously
washed
all
the
wax
from
it
with

is
suitable
for
the
purpose
let
it
remain
a

then
rub
it
in
with

this
preparation
of

is
necessary
to
remove

put
in
the
teeth
just
before

and
washed
out
in
the

an
excellent
preservative
of

it
is
very
important
for
parents
to
insist
on
children
cleaning
their
teeth
at
least
it
is
well
for
them
to
begin
before
they

the
gloves
are
not
made
too
wet
or
they
will
have
a
wrinkled

dark
gloves
that
are
worn
in

should
be
exposed
to
the
sun
for
about
a
quarter
of

and
have
been
proved
to

in
a
number
of
instances
as

on
the
breast
and

of
the

often
has
a
good
effect
they
should
be
frequently
and
when
one
part
is
irritated
change
them
to
another
place
put
one
on
your
side
if
you
have
a
pain

the
skin
by
all
means
which
with
the
above
simple
remedies
will
cure
a
cold
if
begun
with
in
time
i
have
frequently
known
new
flannel
put
on
those
that
usually
wore
it
greatly
to
benefit
a
delicate
person
the
increased
irritation
of
the
new
flannel
acts
on
the
pores
of
the
skin
and
promotes
circulation
hair
soles
worn
in
the
shoe
or
socks
made
of
flannel
or
soft
buckskin
worn
under
the
stockings
are
very
good
to
keep
the
feet
warm
and
dry
persons
predisposed
to
consumption
should
have
nourishing
food
and
not
eat
too
much
at
a
time
they
should
avoid
strong
tea
or
coffee
and
drink
milk
eggs
oysters
fresh
fish
and
fowls
are
very
good
for
them
fruit
of
all
kinds
is
useful
they
should
take
exercise
in
the
air
particularly
riding
on
or
take
a
short
walk
but
not
so
as
to
be
fatigued
to
work
moderately
in
a
garden
when
the
ground
is
not
too
damp
is
good
exercise
for
a
delicate
person
the
smell
of
fresh
earth
and
of
flowers
is
beneficial
to
both
body
and
mind
after
taking
exercise
a
glass
of
lemonade
is
very
refreshing
and
promotes
appetite
if
there
should
be
perspiration
at
night
change
the
sheets
and
frequently
and
the
under
garments
air
the
chamber
and
every
day
if
the
weather
is
too
damp
to
raise
the
windows
shake
up
the
bed
and
leave
it
unmade
half
of
the
day
and
put
it
out
in
the
sun
occasionally
by
all
means
avoid
strong
medicine
or
any
thing
that
has
a
tendency
to
weaken
the
body
sometimes
blisters
are
used
with
very
good
effect
also
rubbing
the
breast
and
back
with
camphor
or
spirits
or
with
a
piece
of
dry
flannel
taking
anodyne
drops
particularly
laudanum
should
be
avoided
if
possible
they
may
still
the
cough
during
the
night
but
it
will
come
on
with
increased
violence
in
the
morning
they
weaken
the
stomach
increase
the
fever
and
sometimes
cause
delirium
everything
that
tends
to
excite
or
irritate
the
mind
should
be
kept
from
them
it
is
very
important
to
talk
cheerfully
to
sick
persons
particularly
if
confined
to
their
chamber
which
can
be
done
without
lightness
or
trifling
if
they
see
gloomy
faces
around
them
it
has
a
very
disheartening
effect
and
if
the
mind
sinks
such
is
its
intimate
connection
with
the
body
that
it
is
hard
to
raise
it
i
have
known
persons
by
judicious
management
to
live
for
many
years
after
it
was
thought
they
were
in
a
deep
decline
by
avoiding
weakening
medicines
taking
exercise
on
and
on
foot
and
never
indulging
in
a
full
meal
sometimes
such
persons
have
very
good
appetites
and
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
their
friends
to
see
them
eat
heartily
but
they
should
eat
something
frequently
rather
than
the
stomach
too
much
when
they
come
in
hungry
from
a
ride
to
beat
up
an
egg
with
a
of
wine
and
a
little
sugar
and
nutmeg
put
in
a
tumbler
with
some
milk
and
taken
with
a
cracker
or
biscuit
or
a
piece
of
thin
toast
broken
up
in
it
has
a
very
strengthening
effect
persons
are
seldom
benefitted
by
a
strict
diet
but
it
is
sometimes
enforced
till
they
lose
their
appetite
and
can
not
eat
if
the
weather
is
so
that
exercise
can
not
be
taken
out
of
doors
some
method
should
be
devised
for
taking
it
in
the
house
rubbing
furniture
and
playing
are
good
exercise
for
a
female
but
should
not
be
taken
too
much
at
a
time
men
that
are
confined
to
the
house
are
sometimes
very
much
at
a
loss
what
to
do
if
such
would
purchase
a
few
tools
and
appropriate
a
spare
room
as
a
workshop
it
would
promote
their
health
i
have
known
men
that
were
but
little
acquainted
with
the
use
of
tools
do
many
useful
and
ornamental
pieces
of
work
that
were
greatly
valued
by
their
friends
and
the
exertion
kept
their
spirits
from
sinking

the
weather
was
too
inclement
to
take
exercise
in
the
open
air

a

take
a

the
juice
of
the
green

is
a
dose
and
for
a

where
there
is

fever
a
little
port
or
claret
wine
mixed
with
sugar
and
water
and
taken
with
toast
broken
in
it
is
beneficial
children
should
be
taken
out
riding
if
possible
and
should
be
well
wrapped
up
for
the
croup
put
the
child
in
warm
water
and
keep
up
the
temperature
by
putting
in
more
hot
water
keep
it
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
then
wipe

next
morning
give
it
a
dose
of
rhubarb
tea
or
castor
oil
and
keep
it
from
the
air
for
several
days
this
treatment
has
been
very
beneficial
when
a
physician
was
not
at
hand
and
nothing
had
been
done
till
his
arrival
perhaps
the
child
would
have
been
too
far
gone
to
recover
in
cases
of
croup
to
wet
a
piece
of
flannel
with
alcohol
and
apply
it
to
the
throat
as
hot
as
it
can
be
borne
has
often
a
salutary
effect
applied
frequently
it
is
also
good
to
use
for
a
bad
cold
molasses
stewed
with
a
lump
of
butter

of
vinegar
taken
just
before
you
go

to

it
with

given
relief
when
a
child
was
very
ill
sliced
onions
or
garlic
stewed
with
sugar
and
water
or
molasses
is
very
good
to
take
for
a
cold
where
children
are
subject
to
the
croup
you
should
always
have
a
pot
of
water
over
the
fire
and
near
to
heat
it
as
quick
as
possible
children
that
are
subject
to
these
attacks
should
have
their
feet
kept
warm
and
dry
and
always
wear
flannel
next
to
the
skin
it
is
the
duty
of
parents
to
make
use
of
the
most
simple
remedies
which
may
always
be
in
readiness
and
if
applied
in
time
may
prevent
the
necessity
of
giving
strong
medicines
which
injure
the
constitutions
of
young
children
the
least
symptom
of
the
disease
should
be
attended
to
lobelia
is
a
certain
remedy
for
croup
if
the
case
is
light
a
few
drops
of
the
tincture
increasing
the
dose
according
to
the
age
of
the
child
given
at
short
intervals
will
cause
it
to
vomit
and
prevent
danger
but
if
the
attack
is
a
severe
one
you
should
give
the
third
preparation
of
lobelia
for
a
child
of
ten
years
ten
drops
and
so
on
in
proportion
mix
it
with
sugar
and
water
every
mother
should
keep
lobelia
at
hand
as
it
has
been
known
to
give
certain
relief
in
many
cases
a
child
of
twelve
months
may
take
of
the
tincture
ten
drops
every
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
till
it
acts
as
an
emetic
or
relieves
by
perspiration
one
of
two
or
three
years
may
take
twenty
or
thirty
drops
the
third
preparation
is
of
much
greater
strength
than
the
tincture
infants
colic
tea
made
of
catnip
and
sweetened
given
to
an
infant
when
it
appears
to
be
in
pain
is
often
useful
sweet
marjoram
tea
also
relieves
pain
and
has
a
soothing
effect
on
the
nerves
to
put
the
feet
in
warm
water
and
put
a
warm
piece
of
flannel
to
the
stomach
is
important
but
if
neither
of
these
relieve
the
child
put
it
in
warm
water
for
about
ten
minutes
and
cover
it
from
the
air
carefully
wipe
it
dry
and
keep
it
warm
afterwards
a
little
weak
ginger
tea
is
good
for
the
colic
as
also
tea
made
of
dried
damask
rose
leaves
a
of
leaves
will
make
a
of
tea
uneasiness
is
frequently
caused
by
their
stomachs
being
overloaded
with
food
and
care
should
be
taken
in
this
respect
having
lately
met
with
some
remarks
in
the
baltimore
american
with
which
i
am
much
pleased
i
take
the
liberty
of
inserting
them
narcotics
and
anodynes
can
not
be
given
with
too
much
caution
the
sensitive
and
nervous
system
of
an
infant
should
never
be
acted
upon
by
these
powerful
drugs
unless
in
extreme
cases
and
of
these
few
mothers
should
presume
to
judge
two
drops
of
laudanum
says
the
london
medical
gazette
have
been
known
to
kill
an
infant
and
a
single
drop
it
is
said
stole
the
life
of
a
new
born
babe
the
most
experienced
medical
men
never
administer
medicines
of
this
class
to
the
very
young
without
exercising
the
utmost
caution
and
making
the
most
accurate
calculations
in
the
present
day
the
more
general
diffusion
of
correct
facts
in
physiology
and
pathology
has
caused
a
large
class
of
young
mothers
to
reject
the
old
system
of
giving
narcotic
drugs
to
infants
in
carrying
out
this
salutary
reformation
like
all
other
reformers
they
have
a
strong
opposition
to
contend
with
old
fashioned
nurses
do
much
harm
in
opposing
all
nursery
reformations
consequently
young
mothers
will
have
a
hard
task
to
execute
too
many
have
not
the
steady
courage
to
hold
on
to
the
end
in
mild
but
firm
opposition
to
all
erroneous
but
well
meant
interference
but
there
are
others
whose
pure
and
unswerving
love
for
their
tender
keeps
them
firm
to
their
duty
to
these
the
next
generation
will
owe
much
they
are
the
little
band
of
reformers
whose
good
example
will
be
like
leaven
spreading
until
its
influence
is
felt
throughout
the
wide
circle
of
maternal
responsibility
summer
diseases
the
food
of
children
in
summer
should
be
light
and
nourishing
if
of
milk
be
careful
that
it
is
sweet
if
you
can
not
get
it
fresh
as
often
as
you
want
it
boiling
will
keep
it
sweet
sour
milk
and
improper
food
sometimes
bring
on
the
summer
disease
which
is
easier
prevented
than
cured
a
little
rhubarb
tea
or
tincture
with
a
small
quantity
of
prepared
chalk
will
sometimes
check
it
in
its
early
stages
but
the
most
effectual
medicine
that
i
have
tried
is
called
by
some
apothecaries
red
mixture
of
which
i
will
give
a
recipe
chicken
water
slightly
salted
is
very
good
make
but
a
little
at
a
time
and
have
it
fresh
rice
gruel
sweetened
with
and
a
little
nutmeg
is
nourishing
to
make
a
drink
of
shave
the
bark
fine
and
put
it
in
water
strain
it
mix
it
with
milk
and
sweeten
it
elderberry
and
blackberry
cordials
are
also
good
in
cases
where
there
is
no
fever
the
stomach
and
back
should
be
bathed
with
spirits
and
a
little
bag
of
pounded
spices
wet
with
spirits
applied
to
the
stomach
may
be
used
with
safety
when
not
within
reach
of
a
physician
a
bark
jacket
has
been
used
with
success
in
many
instances
cut
it
out

fine
muslin
to
be

spread
it
open
and
cover
one
side
with
about
two
ounces
of
the

protect
its

from
the
light
when
a
child
is
taken
sick
in
a
city
removing
it
to
the
country
often
has
a
beneficial
effect
milk
thickened

arrow
root
is
good
diet
for
children
flour
dried
in
an
oven
for
several
hours
and
used
to
thicken
milk
or
water
is
also
good
sweetened
with
and
is
nutritious
they
should
eat
but
a
small
portion
of
any
thing
at
a
time
to
cut
slices
of
lean
fresh
beef
or
mutton
put
it
in
a
bowl
and
pour
a
pint
of
boiling
water
on
it
and
let
it
set
close
to
the
fire
for
an
hour
is
very
good
to
give
children
occasionally
with
but
little
salt
the
stomach
will
sometimes
retain
this
when
other
things
are
rejected
as
thirst
is
an
attendant
on
this
disease
much
salt
should
be
avoided
in
all
their
food
every
thing
about
a
sick
child
should
be
kept
clean
and
its
clothes
well
aired
before
changing
them
if
it
is
too
ill
to
carry
out
of
doors
have
it
changed
from
one
room
to
another
and
the
apartment
it
left
well
aired
children
who
are
afflicted
with
this

sometimes
crave

be
toasted

both
sides
very
dry

boiling
water
poured

it
i
hope
these
hints
will
be
useful
to
persons
that
can
not
procure
a

is
frequently
brought
on
by

should
be
found
unpleasant
take
a

something
of
that
kind
after
it
it
will
answer
quite
as
well
to
keep

mix
them
just
as
you
take
the

remarks
after

years
experience
of
this
medicine
in
myself
and
others
it
is
impossible
for

to
speak

higher
than

powdered
spanish
flies
put
them
in
half
a
pint

wash
the
part
affected
occasionally
this
has
been
highly
recommended
to
me

i
have
never
seen
it
tried
for
cramp
in
the

salt
in
a
of
warm
water
if
this
does
not
stop
the
vomiting
and
cramp

very
useful
in
stopping
the
operation
of
an
emetic
when

are
taken
with
the
cramp
in
the
night
and
by
placing
the
foot
against
it
will
sometimes
give
relief
another
remedy
is
to
tie
a
string
round
the
limb
between
the
body
and
the
pain
about
as
tight
as
a
physician
does
to
draw
blood
wear
a
bandage
filled
with
pounded
brimstone
round
the
limb
to
prevent
a
return
of
it
sometimes
to
hold
a
roll
of
brimstone
in
each
hand
will
relieve
the
cramp
and
persons
subject
to
it
should
keep
some
by
the
to
use
in
the
night
for
scalds
and
burns

persons
are
badly
scalded
or
burned

wet
it
with
spirits
is
very
good

remedies
are
linseed
oil
and
lime
water
starch
and
cream
scraped
potatoes
molasses
and
eggs
beaten
up
and
put
on
immediately
almost
any
thing
will
relieve
the
pain
that
excludes
the
air

careful
not
to
break
the
skin
as
it
will
be
longer
in
healing
if
a
foot
is
scalded
pour
cold
water
over
it
and
cut
the
stocking
you
should
be
careful
to
use
linen
rags
about
a
burn
as
cotton
rags
cause
irritation
after
the
place
begins
to
heal
up
a
salve
may
be
applied
made
of
equal

on
frequently
wetting
the
sore
with
thick
cream

also
soothing
be
careful
that
the
limb
does
not
contract
as
there
is

the
sinews
are
affected
if
there

be
given

domestics
hints
on
the
management
of
domestics
some
families
are
always
changing
their
domestics
and
weary
their
friends
with
complaints
of
those
they
have
and
inquiries
for
others
deliberate
before
you
make
a
change
if
servants
are
honest
speak
the
truth
and
have
an
obliging
disposition
it
is
better
to
bear
with
a
few
defects
than
to
discharge
them
these
are
qualifications
for
the
foundation
of
a
good
servant
and
some
of
the
most
valuable
i
have
had
were
such
as
could
hardly
be
put
up
with
at
first
by
being
patient
and
speaking
to
them
in
a
kind
manner
they
become
attached
and
fearful
of
doing
any
thing
to
offend
when
they
break
any
thing
or
an
accident
occurs
accustom
them
to
inform
you
of
it
immediately
few
mistresses
of
well
regulated
minds
will
be
offended
when
openly
told
of
accidents
but
if
they
are
left
to
be
found
out
you
always
feel
more
disposed
to
blame
and
reprove
them
by
speaking
to
them
in
a
mild
and
forgiving
manner
careless
servants
will
become
more
careful
a
considerate
mistress
may
without
loss
of
dignity
make
them
feel
that
she
regards
it
as
her
duty
to
be
their
friend
and
that
she
feels
herself
under
an
obligation
to
advise
them
in
difficulties
and
promote
their
comfort
we
should
reflect
that
theirs
is
a
life
of
servitude
and
if
they
themselves
or
are
too
much
exposed
in
early
life
it
will
bring
on
disease
that
will
shorten
their
days
or
render
old
age
a
burden
some
young
persons
are
too
indolent
to
wait
on
themselves
and
ring
for
the
servants
on
the
most
trifling
occasions
when
if
they
were
accustomed
to
perform
these
little
offices
their
health
would
be
much
better
and
we
should
not
hear
of
so
many
complaints
the
result
of
want
of
exercise
all
female
servants
should
have
time
to
attend
to
their
clothing
many
have
to
work
so
hard
through
the
day
that
their
only
leisure
is
at
night
and
then
they
hurry
over
their
things
in
a
careless
manner
where
your
circumstances
permit
a
good
is
a
valuable
acquisition
and
they
are
sometimes
more
easily
governed
than
females
if
mistresses
were
better
informed
they
would
not
complain
so
much
of
the
ignorance
and
awkwardness
of
their
domestics
always
give
them
their
orders
in
time
if
a
new
dish
is
to
be
cooked
superintend
its
preparation
yourself
if
you
are
capable
of
directing
a
cook
will
soon
learn
to
do
without
your
constant
attention
if
they
are
slow
in
their
movements
insist
on
their
beginning
early
to
prepare
a
meal
so
that
there
will
be
time
sufficient
for
every
thing
to
be
done
properly
if
you
expect
company
have
every
thing
prepared
that
can
be
done
with
safety
the
day
previous
in
summer
there
are
but
few
things
that
can
be
done
without
risk
of
spoiling
a
ham
or
tongue
may
he
washed
ready
to
boil
castors
and
put
in
order
and
pastry
or
dessert
prepared
that
will
not
spoil
by
being
kept
a
day
in
winter
many
things
can
be
kept
for
days
in
a
state
of
preparation
for
cooking
and
it
greatly
assists
the
work
of
the
family
to
have
every
thing
done
beforehand
do
with
as
few
domestics
as
possible
assist
with
the
work
yourself
rather
than
keep
one
too
many
those
that
take
orphan
children
to
bring
up
are
often
rewarded
for
their
trouble
as
sometimes
a
girl
of
fifteen
will
be
more
useful
than
one
much
older
and
where
a
family
is
small
it
does
very
well
but
in
large
families
a
little
girl
is
so
often
called
from
her
work
that
it
has
a
tendency
to
unsettle
and
make
her
careless
never
allow
your
children
to
call
on
or
interrupt
servants
when
at
their
work
or
meals
to
do
any
thing
which
a
child
could
do
for
itself
children
that
treat
domestics
with
respect
will
generally
find
them
willing
to
render
any
assistance
in
their
power
i
have
known
a
few
housekeepers
who
have
kept
the
same
servants
for
years
who
have
assisted
in
rearing
the
children
until
they
almost
viewed
them
as
their
own
and
these
were
not
faultless
if
they
had
been
discharged
for
trifles
they
might
have
wandered
from
one
family
to
another
without
being
attached
to
any
until
they
became
so
indifferent
as
not
to
be
worthy
of
employ
but
by
the
kindness
and
patience
of
their
employer
they
became
so
grateful
and
attached
as
to
be
a
treasure
to
her
family
when
they
become
weary
of
such
constant
servitude
would
it
not
be
better
instead
of
discharging
to
give
them
time
for
rest
and
recreation
in
visiting
their
friends
i
have
known
them
to
return
renewed
in
health
and
spirits
encourage
them
to
lay
by
as
much
of
their
wages
as
they
can
possibly
spare
in
such
institutions
as
are
thought
the
most
safe
that
they
may
have
something
to
look
to
in
case
of
sickness
or
any
event
which
would
require
its
use
promote
their
reading
in
such
books
as
are
suited
to
their
capacities
they
sometimes
have
a
little
leisure
that
could
be
well
filled
up
in
this
way
i
have
found
it
to
increase
the
happiness
of
those
under
my
care
to
encourage
a
fondness
for
reading
and
improving
their
minds
it
tends
to
keep
them
from
unprofitable
company
and
too
much
visiting
to
which
so
many
are
addicted
young
girls
should
make
and
mend
their
own
clothes
and
keep
them
in
good
order
and
they
should
be
taught
to
knit
the
material
of
which
stockings
are
composed
costs
but
little
and
they
wear
much
better
than
those
that
are
bought
knitting
fills
up
leisure
moments
and
promotes
industrious
habits
and
when
age
comes
on
they
will
have
a
resource
although
it
appears
so
simple
yet
if
it
is
not
learned
while
young
it
is
hard
to
acquire
when
old
when
servants
are
guilty
of
faults
that
can
not
be
looked
over
instead
of
publicly
reproving
them
take
an
opportunity
when
alone
and
talk
coolly
tell
them
of
your
sorrow
at
being
obliged
to
notice
their
conduct
encourage
them
to
pursue
a
different
course
and
that
you
will
forgive
them
if
they
will
strive
to
do
better
i
have
known
them
much
improved
by
this
mode
of
treatment
by
inspecting
every
department
not
only
will
waste
be
prevented
but
dishonesty
in
cities
many
persons
find
it
necessary
to
lock
up
nearly
every
thing
and
it
is
a
lamentable
state
of
things
that
so
few
are
to
be
trusted
sometimes
treating
servants
with
confidence
will
have
a
good
effect
but
let
them
be
aware
that
you
have
a
knowledge
of
every
thing
that
is
going
on
some
young
persons
are
completely
at
the
mercy
of
their
domestics
i
have
known
great
uneasiness
to
be
experienced
and
much
loss
but
by
showing
a
little
moral
courage
and
discharging
those
that
are
irreclaimable
an
ascendancy
was
gained
never
suffer
them
to
treat
you
with
disrespect
or
impertinence
if
it
is
known
that
they
will
be
discharged
for
these
faults
they
will
be
on
their
guard
if
you
have
taken
a
boy
or
girl
to
bring
up
as
a
domestic
endeavour
to
teach
them
at
least
to
spell
and
read
they
are
sometimes
very
fond
of
their
books
and
if
you
once
get
them
to
reading
it
will
become
to
them
a
favorite
evening
amusement
i
have
known
them
take
up
their
books
on
every
occasion
of
leisure
i
have
seen
boys
that
worked
hard
through
the
day
spend
all
the
evening
with
their
books
slate
and
occasionally
a
little
writing
sometimes
i
have
in
the
evening
felt
fatigued
and
listless
and
would
much
rather
read
and
amuse
myself
than
go
out
to
teach
two
or
three
in
the
kitchen
but
in
attending
to
this
which
i
consider
a
duty
have
felt
a
sweet
reward
indeed
their
grateful
thanks
expressed
by
words
have
encouraged
me
to
keep
on
i
have
thought
a
little
instruction
in
this
way
arouses
their
faculties
and
tends
to
make
them
more
industrious
when
i
have
been
prevented
from
teaching
them
for
some
time
by
indisposition
or
other
causes
i
have
observed
they
were
not
so
cheerful
in
the
performance
of
their
work
if
they
are
reading
any
thing
they
do
not
fully
understand
take
a
little
time
to
explain
it
to
them
it
will
be
my
young
friends
like
sowing
the
good
seed
and
you
as
well
as
they
will
receive
the
reward
i
wish
to
encourage
you
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
to
attend
to
duty
you
will
find
it
will
strengthen
you
in
the
performance
of
others
the
more
we
exert
our
faculties
the
more
we
can
accomplish
he
that
does
nothing
renders
himself
incapable
of
doing
any
thing
while
we
are
executing
one
work
we
are
preparing
ourselves
to
undertake
another
remarks
remarks
on
carving
i
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
say
much
on
the
subject
of
carving
as
those
who
are
accustomed
to
sit
at
a
well
ordered
table
and
who
observe
the
manner
of
the
host
and
hostess
can
soon
acquire
the
art
both
of
carving
and
helping
with
ease
and
when
placed
at
the
head
of
their
own
table
the
knowledge
thus
gained
will
be
found
a
great
assistance
the
proper
time
for
children
to
acquire
good
habits
at
meals
is
not
when
there
is
company
it
should
be
an
every
day
lesson
as
when
parents
are
engaged
with
their
friends
or
guests
they
have
no
time
to
devote
to
the
manners
of
their
children
and
to
reprove
them
at
table
is
very
unpleasant
as
well
as
mortifying
young
children
will
soon
acquire
the
manner
of
sitting
quietly
till
they
are
helped
if
they
are
made
to
understand
that
they
will
not
be
permitted
to
eat
with
their
parents
and
friends
unless
they
behave
with
propriety
i
have
thought
it
a
great
assistance
to
the
good
order
of
a
large
family
for
every
member
to
be
punctual
in
their
attendance
at
meals
and
all
to
sit
down
together
with
a
short
pause
before
the
carving
and
helping
commences
in
those
moments
of
quiet
the
heart
is
sometimes
awakened
to
a
feeling
of
gratitude
to
the
almighty
dispenser
of
our
blessings
at
the
table
different
members
of
the
family
meet
and
where
affection
and
kindness
those
aids
to
true
politeness
preside
it
is
truly
a
delightful
treat
to
be
the
guest
of
such
a
family
every
symptom
of
selfishness
should
be
discouraged
for
if
suffered
to
take
root
in
a
child
it
lays
the
foundation
of
much
that
is
disagreeable
to
themselves
and
others
inculcate
this
excellent
rule
of
doing
unto
others
what
you
wish
others
to
do
unto
you
and
always
preferring
others
to
yourself
it
is
the
custom
in
some
well
regulated
families
to
permit
the
younger
members
as
they
arrive
at
a
suitable
age
to
take
turns
in
presiding
not
only
at
breakfast
and
tea
but
at
the
dinner
table
i
have
known
quite
young
girls
that
had
been
taught
in
this
way
carve
a
fowl
or
joint
of
meat
with
ease
and
grace
in
helping
they
should
be
taught
not
to
the
plate
as
it
takes
away
the
appetite
of
some
persons
to
be
helped
too
largely
the
gravy
should
be
stirred
so
that
all
may
be
helped
alike
and
a
small
quantity
put
on
the
meat
or
fowl
to
which
it
belongs
and
not
on
vegetables
unless
it
is
particularly
desired
if
there
should
be
a
rare
dish
on
the
table
it
is
best
to
hand
it
round
and
let
every
one
help
himself
after
it
has
been
nicely
cut
up
ham
is
much
nicer
to
be
cut
in
very
thin
slices
so
is
salt
beef
and
tongue
young
housekeepers
in
selecting
their
dishes
for
dinner
if
they
have
not
an
experienced
cook
should
avoid
those
that
are
difficult
to
prepare
never
try
a
new
dish
when
you
expect
company
your
guests
will
be
more
gratified
with
a
neat
and
moderate
table
with
a
few
plain
and
well
cooked
dishes
accompanied
with
the
smiling
countenance
of
the
hostess
than
with
a
great
variety
of
ill
cooked
and
badly
arranged
viands
economy
the
source
of
charity
if
your
circumstances
will
not
admit
of
giving
away
much
you
can
by
economy
give
a
little
and
a
blessing
will
attend
it
there
are
few
of
the
very
poor
that
know
how
to
repair
old
clothing
to
advantage
a
garment
will
be
of
much
more
service
that
is
well
mended
before
it
is
given
to
them
it
has
been
remarked
that
the
poor
are
ungrateful
and
forget
the
favors
conferred
upon
them
i
have
seldom
found
them
deficient
in
this
respect
and
when
they
are
if
we
would
reflect
that
if
some
of
us
received
no
more
than
we
deserve
we
should
be
but
poorly
off
we
know
in
our
own
families
how
acceptable
is
a
nice
present
of
something
that
a
sick
member
can
eat
and
it
is
sometimes
the
means
of
restoring
the
appetite
when
any
thing
cooked
in
the
house
is
rejected
the
feeling
of
love
with
which
it
is
presented
is
as
a
cordial
to
a
sick
person
how
much
more
acceptable
will
something
nourishing
be
to
one
oppressed
with
poverty
as
well
as
sickness
when
the
rich
are
diseased
the
physician
often
finds
it
necessary
to
enjoin
strict
abstinence
but
very
different
is
it
with
the
poor
who
frequently
suffer
for
want
of
nourishment
when
the
mother
of
a
poor
family
is
ill
how
greatly
are
her
sufferings
augmented
by
the
knowledge
that
her
children
are
deprived
of
her
services
and
how
acceptable
to
such
a
family
would
be
a
loaf
of
bread
or
a
large
bowl
of
soup
which
could
be
made
of
materials
that
would
hardly
be
missed
dried
beans
or
peas
and
onions
are
a
cheap
and
valuable
addition
to
soup
also
cold
vegetables
the
liquor
that
fresh
meat
is
boiled
in
should
be
carefully
saved
for
that
purpose
if
there
are
those
near
you
that
need
it
it
may
seem
at
first
troublesome
to
a
young
housekeeper
to
take
the
necessary
care
to
save
for
the
poor
it
is
certainly
much
easier
to
let
the
cook
have
her
own
way
and
waste
or
not
as
she
pleases
but
for
your
encouragement
my
young
friends
permit
me
to
say
you
will
be
sweetly
rewarded
for
your
attention
to
them
one
eminent
for
his
charities
near
the
close
of
life
made
this
remark
what
i
spent
i
lost
but
what
i
gave
away
remains
with
me
to
encourage
children
in
acts
of
kindness
to
the
aged
and
afflicted
young
children
may
early
be
taught
to
administer
to
the
wants
of
the
aged
and
infirm
some
mothers
are
in
the
practice
of
giving
a
small
sum
of
money
to
their
children
as
a
reward
for
some
little
service
or
piece
of
work
that
they
have
done
the
money
thus
obtained
to
be
laid
out
for
a
sick
or
old
poor
person
this
method
has
an
excellent
effect
on
the
minds
of
children
it
incites
them
to
industry
teaches
and
the
feelings
of
love
and
charity
which
are
thus
early
instilled
into
their
tender
minds
make
a
lasting
impression
if
they
spent
their
little
fund
in
trifles
for
their
own
use
they
would
acquire
a
habit
of
selfishness
which
when
once
formed
it
is
most
difficult
to
eradicate
i
have
remarked
the
pleasure
with
which
children
will
relate
the
incidents
of
a
visit
which
they
have
been
permitted
to
make
to
a
poor
family
and
it
is
a
refreshment
to
persons
advanced
in
life
to
see
a
young
family
thus
trained
as
soon
as
little
girls
can
sew
they
should
be
encouraged
to
make
garments
for
the
poor
or
repair
their
own
old
ones
as
a
present
to
a
child
of
their
own
size
or
make
patchwork
out
of
old
dresses
for
a
bed
covering
for
poor
people
their
being
permitted
to
do
these
things
should
be
as
a
reward
for
good
behavior
and
attention
to
their
lessons
or
other
duties
when
they
are
old
enough
to
make
a
loaf
of
bread
a
pie
or
a
little
plain
cake
allow
them
to
do
it
and
take
as
a
present
to
or
make
broth
or
panada
for
a
sick
person
this
teaches
them
to
prepare
these
things
while
young
and
may
be
useful
to
them
in
after
life
how
cheering
it
must
be
to
the
aged
or
afflicted
to
see
smiling
young
faces
enter
their
dwellings
bearing
their
little
offerings
of
food
or
clothing
the
work
of
their
own
hands
be
encouraged
my
dear
young
mothers
if
you
thus
train
your
children
to
works
of
charity
you
will
be
doubly
blessed
early
rising
promotes
punctuality
it
is
an
old
and
true
saying
that
if
you
waste
an
hour
in
the
morning
it
is
seldom
recovered
all
that
day
this
dispirits
you
and
the
next
day
there
is
still
something
left
undone
a
late
riser
is
rarely
punctual
in
her
engagements
and
more
of
the
happiness
of
married
life
depends
on
forming
a
habit
of
strict
punctuality
than
young
persons
are
generally
aware
of
if
you
are
distressed
at
having
acquired
habits
of
late
rising
and
want
of
punctuality
remember
by
perseverance
they
can
be
overcome
fix
an
hour
for
rising
and
let
nothing
but
illness
prevent
your
being
up
at
that
time
while
forming
this
useful
habit
you
should
retire
to
rest
early
many
things
can
be
better
attended
to
at
an
early
than
a
late
hour
in
the
morning
where
families
rise
before
the
sun
the
day
seems
much
longer
all
the
active
employments
of
the
early
riser
are
accomplished
before
her
later
neighbors
have
finished
their
breakfast
the
duties
of
the
bath
and
toilet
being
performed
her
chamber
well
aired
and
arranged
and
her
parlor
in
order
she
is
ready
for
the
more
quiet
employments
of
reading
and
sewing
in
a
well
regulated
household
servants
perform
their
duties
with
life
and
energy
determine
on
an
hour
for
your
meals
and
if
all
the
members
of
the
family
adhere
to
it
scrupulous
exactness
will
soon
be
established
hints
to
young
wives
the
authoress
is
well
aware
of
the
difficulties
which
surround
a
young
wife
on
her
first
setting
out
particularly
if
situated
at
a
distance
from
the
kind
mother
who
has
hitherto
directed
her
with
servants
who
watch
every
movement
and
who
will
soon
discover
whether
the
new
mistress
is
qualified
for
the
task
she
has
undertaken
accustom
yourself
to
rise
early
fix
a
certain
hour
and
let
nothing
but
indisposition
prevent
your
being
up
at
the
appointed
time
by
this
means
your
affairs
will
all
be
arranged
in
good
season
and
you
will
have
time
for
recreation
in
walking
riding
or
in
reading
such
authors
as
will
tend
to
strengthen
and
improve
your
mind
young
persons
removed
from
large
families
often
suffer
greatly
from
loneliness
whereas
if
they
were
occupied
with
household
affairs
they
would
not
feel
so
severely
the
absence
of
their
husbands
while
attending
to
business
be
punctual
to
the
hour
that
has
been
fixed
on
for
your
meals
and
let
good
order
prevail
in
every
department
of
which
you
have
the
command
a
mistress
of
a
family
is
much
happier
who
knows
how
every
thing
is
going
on
from
the
garret
to
the
cellar
by
inspecting
every
thing
you
soon
become
interested
and
we
all
know
when
that
is
the
case
the
most
difficult
pursuits
become
easy
and
pleasant
and
with
what
pleasure
will
a
young
wife
welcome
her
husband
to
his
meals
when
her
conscience
assures
her
that
she
has
done
her
best
and
that
nothing
is
neglected
and
how
will
it
lighten
his
labors
to
reflect
when
absent
that
the
partner
he
has
chosen
is
performing
her
duty
at
home
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
the
formation
of
domestic
happiness
is
generally
laid
the
first
year
of
marriage
therefore
my
young
friends
act
well
your
part
if
you
desire
to
be
treated
with
confidence
you
must
merit
it
if
you
keep
an
exact
account
of
all
your
expenses
there
will
be
less
danger
of
living
beyond
your
income
of
which
there
have
been
so
many
lamentable
instances
never
buy
any
thing
because
it
is
recommended
as
being
cheap
many
cheap
things
amount
in
time
to
a
large
sum
in
selecting
furniture
let
utility
not
fashion
govern
your
choice
some
young
persons
furnish
their
parlors
so
extravagantly
that
necessary
and
useful
articles
are
neglected
for
want
of
means
to
purchase
them
be
persuaded
that
happiness
does
not
consist
so
much
in
having
splendid
furniture
as
in
attending
to
the
every
day
comforts
of
those
around
you
if
you
marry
without
the
useful
knowledge
necessary
for
governing
your
family
lose
no
time
in
acquiring
it
there
is
a
time
when
most
young
girls
show
a
fondness
for
domestic
affairs
before
they
are
old
enough
to
go
into
company
when
it
would
be
an
agreeable
change
to
be
absent
from
school
and
assisting
their
mothers
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
would
never
be
lost
many
a
young
man
who
commenced
with
fair
prospects
has
been
ruined
through
his
wife
ignorance
of
domestic
duties
and
she
has
suffered
from
the
consequent
diminution
of
his
esteem
and
love
i
once
knew
a
lovely
and
accomplished
young
lady
accustomed
to
every
indulgence
who
on
her
marriage
removed
several
hundred
miles
from
her
parents
to
reside
in
the
country
where
servants
were
difficult
to
procure
this
delicate
and
sensitive
young
creature
was
much
distressed
by
her
ignorance
of
almost
every
thing
connected
with
housekeeping
and
after
suffering
repeated
mortifications
concluded
to
learn
to
do
the
work
herself
and
when
this
dearly
bought
knowledge
was
acquired
she
was
able
to
teach
her
ignorant
servants
and
resolved
if
ever
she
had
daughters
to
use
every
means
in
her
power
to
teach
them
when
a
prudent
wife
is
made
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
her
husband
she
will
endeavor
strictly
to
keep
within
their
bounds
always
remembering
that
losses
and
events
over
which
he
has
no
control
may
occur
and
greatly
reduce
his
income
and
how
will
it
assist
her
to
bear
a
reverse
of
fortune
if
she
has
acted
with
discretion
it
will
strengthen
the
wife
to
encourage
and
cheer
her
partner
and
enable
him
to
struggle
through
difficulties
which
were
thought
insurmountable
happiness
will
not
forsake
such
a
family
though
they
lose
almost
every
thing
the
peace
which
is
the
result
of
a
good
conscience
will
remain
this
will
strengthen
them
to
begin
anew
and
the
divine
blessing
will
attend
such
efforts
a
few
remarks
to
encourage
young
housekeepers
in
their
first
attempts
as
bread
is
the
most
important
article
of
food
one
of
your
first
attempts
should
be
to
make
a
few
loaves
of
good
bread
and
rolls
of
the
most
simple
kind
bread
rolls
are
very
easily
made
if
you
succeed
tolerably
it
will
encourage
you
to
try
again
when
you
make
cakes
begin
with
the
simple
kinds
plain
jumbles
or
cakes
that
you
can
roll
out
or
crisp
sponge
cake
is
easier
than
those
that
have
butter
in
them
i
have
known
young
persons
succeed
very
well
with
it
bread
rusk
is
also
easily
made
or
a
few
plain
pies
do
not
trust
the
baking
to
an
ignorant
person
but
superintend
it
yourself
sometimes
baking
in
a
stove
is
protracted
by
the
dampness
of
the
wood
before
you
bake
have
dry
wood
prepared
watch
the
time
it
is
a
good
plan
to
have
a
clock
near
the
kitchen
do
not
have
too
many
things
on
hand
at
once
but
perfect
yourself
in
the
knowledge
of
a
few
important
dishes
if
you
make
good
yeast
you
will
be
more
certain
of
good
bread
light
cakes
and
rolls
to
cook
a
steak
nicely
is
also
important
and
with
a
dish
of
potatoes
well
cooked
a
dish
of
cold
slaw
and
an
apple
pie
or
a
little
stewed
fruit
will
make
a
good
plain
dinner
when
your
family
is
small
you
can
have
something
nice
every
day
without
cooking
much
veal
cutlets
and
mutton
chops
are
easy
to
cook
and
may
be
prepared
in
a
short
time
if
you
have
a
fowl
and
boil
it
you
can
save
the
soup
and
warm
it
over
for
the
next
day
a
cold
roast
fowl
may
be
hashed
on
days
that
you
have
cold
meat
a
batter
pudding
or
plain
rice
pudding
is
easily
prepared
if
you
wish
to
have
an
early
breakfast
make
every
preparation
that
you
can
over
night
set
the
table
have
the
relish
cut
ready
to
cook
or
to
warm
over
and
cold
bread
may
be
sliced
and
wrapped
in
a
cloth
to
keep
it
moist
coffee
should
be
ground
and
dry
fuel
and
water
at
hand
with
these
preparations
breakfast
may
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
from
the
time
the
fire
is
made
if
you
have
warm
corn
bread
or
rolls
it
will
require
more
time
but
if
you
have
them
made
up
over
night
and
put
in
a
cool
place
they
will
not
sour
and
can
soon
be
baked
maryland
biscuit
are
very
convenient
as
they
are
always
ready
and
will
keep
good
a
week
i
have
found
it
a
great
advantage
to
set
the
table
over
night
particularly
if
you
have
a
separate
room
to
eat
in
although
it
takes
but
a
short
time
every
minute
is
important
in
the
morning
where
the
mistress
washes
the
breakfast
things
and
puts
them
in
their
proper
places
and
counts
the
spoons
and
other
articles
she
can
see
when
any
thing
is
missing
a
mop
is
useful
for
glass
and
china
keep
a
pan
or
a
small
tub
for
the
purpose
of
holding
the
water
which
should
not
be
too
hot
if
tea
things
are
put
in
very
hot
water
it
will
be
apt
to
crack
them
or
they
will
look
smeared
put
a
little
soap
in
the
water
wash
the
glass
first
then
the
silver
then
the
cups
and
saucers
and
lastly
the
plates
and
knives
and
forks
if
spoons
have
been
used
with
eggs
put
them
to
soak
immediately
to
prevent
their
turning
dark
have
a
common
waiter
for
the
pan
to
stand
in
and
on
it
drain
your
tea
things
spoons
when
used
with
care
require
polishing
but
seldom
as
it
wears
the
silver
away
dinner
dishes
should
be
washed
first
in
moderately
warm
water
and
soap
rinsed
in
hot
water
and
drained
before
wiping
put
every
thing
in
its
proper
place
and
inspect
your
pantry
and
cellar
frequently
sometimes
things
are
forgotten
for
want
of
attention
until
they
are
spoiled
air
the
cellar
frequently
do
not
let
refuse
vegetables
accumulate
or
any
thing
that
would
be
likely
to
cause
sickness
you
should
provide
coarse
towels
of
different
kinds
for
china
and
glass
and
for
the
dinner
dishes
also
knife
cloths
have
them
marked
and
kept
in
their
proper
places
some
persons
have
their
towels
washed
out
every
day
but
it
is
better
to
save
them
for
the
weekly
wash
if
towels
are
thrown
aside
damp
they
are
liable
to
mildew
you
should
keep
dusters
of
several
kinds
old
silk
handkerchiefs
are
best
for
highly
polished
furniture
or
an
old
barege
veil
answers
a
good
purpose
for
common
purposes
a
square
of
coarse
muslin
or
check
is
suitable
you
should
keep
one
floor
cloth
for
chambers
and
one
for
the
kitchen
keep
brooms
for
different
purposes
always
use
a
soft
one
for
carpets
as
soon
as
they
wear
stiff
they
will
do
for
the
kitchen
or
pavements
pouring
a
little
hot
water
on
a
broom
softens
it
for
carpets
you
may
save
tea
leaves
to
sprinkle
over
your
carpet
when
you
give
a
thorough
sweeping
this
will
brighten
it
and
occasionally
to
wipe
it
over
with
a
cloth
that
has
been
wrung
out
of
hot
water
cleanses
it
of
course
this
is
only
required
for
carpets
in
constant
use
it
is
of
great
importance
to
health
that
sleeping
apartments
should
be
well
aired
and
swept
if
you
sleep
in
an
apartment
where
there
has
been
fire
during
the
day
it
should
be
well
aired
before
going
to
bed
or
if
the
room
is
close
have
a
little
air
admitted
so
as
not
to
blow
on
persons
that
are
asleep
a
window
that
will
lower
from
the
top
is
an
advantage
beds
should
be
well
aired
before
they
are
made
take
the
clothes
off
and
leave
them
at
least
an
hour
in
pleasant
weather
you
may
keep
chamber
windows
hoisted
for
several
hours
and
even
in
cold
weather
the
windows
may
be
kept
up
a
short
time
and
if
on
any
occasion
you
may
be
obliged
to
have
the
beds
made
without
airing
turn
the
clothes
half
way
down
and
leave
them
for
several
hours
some
persons
have
cheap
calico
covers
to
spread
over
beds
while
the
room
is
swept
this
is
a
good
plan
on
account
of
the
dust
bolster
and
pillow
tucks
wear
better
if
you
have
a
check
case
basted
on
this
should
be
changed
washed
and
starched
occasionally
it
is
a
good
plan
also
to
have
check
covers
for
matresses
and
feather
beds
but
the
covers
should
not
be
kept
on
beds
that
are
not
in
use
lest
they
should
be
liable
to
moth
in
winter
a
blanket
should
be
put
next
a
bed
that
is
not
often
slept
in
or
for
a
delicate
person
and
be
particularly
careful
that
sheets
are
dry
before
they
are
put
away
in
summer
it
is
most
healthy
to
have
your
chamber
floor
bare
and
have
it
washed
occasionally
it
is
important
to
examine
your
clothes
after
they
come
from
the
wash
and
see
that
they
are
perfectly
dry
before
they
are
put
away
cultivation
of
flowers
a
few
flowers
and
plants
when
properly
taken
care
of
are
ornamental
to
the
windows
of
a
parlor
or
sitting
room
and
will
repay
the
care
that
is
bestowed
on
them
begin
with
a
few
that
are
easy
to
cultivate
and
you
will
probably
succeed
persons
that
are
fond
of
flowers
and
have
collected
a
number
are
generally
willing
to
give
their
young
friends
a
few
plants
and
where
we
succeed
in
raising
a
fine
plant
from
a
slip
or
cutting
we
value
it
more
than
one
that
has
been
purchased
at
a
geraniums
cactus
wax
plants
cape
and
catalonian
jessamines
and
some
others
are
easily
cultivated
in
a
parlor
roses
camelias
and
azaleas
bloom
best
in
a
moderate
temperature
as
the
heat
of
a
parlor
unless
very
large
dries
the
buds
and
prevents
their
coming
to
perfection
i
have
known
these
to
bloom
beautifully
in
a
room
that
was
very
slightly
heated
either
over
one
in
which
there
was
fire
or
in
an
apartment
next
a
stove
room
if
the
weather
is
very
cold
they
should
be
removed
to
a
warmer
room
until
it
moderates
the
windows
that
are
open
to
the
south
are
best
when
the
blossoms
have
matured
you
can
bring
them
to
the
parlor
but
if
there
is
much
heat
they
will
not
remain
perfect
so
long
as
in
a
moderate
room
roses
are
sometimes
troubled
with
insects
which
should
be
brushed
off
with
a
feather
and
the
plants
washed
with
a
decoction
of
tobacco
not
too
strong
they
will
not
bloom
when
thus
infested
there
is
another
insect
that
fastens
itself
to
the
bark
of
lemon
trees
and
other
plants
frequent
washing
with
soap
suds
and
brushing
the
sterns
removes
it
and
some
times
wash
the
leaves
with
a
sponge
when
the
weather
is
too
cold
to
put
them
out
of
doors
setting
them
out
in
a
warm
rain
or
watering
them
well
all
over
the
foliage
is
very
reviving
to
plants
be
careful
to
have
pieces
of
old
broken
at
the
bottom
of
each
pot
to
drain
them
or
the
plants
will
not
thrive
the
earth
should
be
sometimes
removed
and
an
occasional
is
an
advantage
being
careful
not
to
disturb
the
roots
a
mixture
of
charcoal
and
sand
and
rich
earth
of
more
than
one
kind
is
thought
best
earth
fresh
from
the
woods
is
good
for
as
well
as
borders
but
should
always
be
mixed
with
a
stronger
soil
roses
that
are
planted
round
a
house
should
have
a
deep
and
rich
soil
made
for
them
and
they
will
then
bloom
beautifully
all
the
season
pot
plants
should
in
summer
be
placed
in
a
situation
where
they
wilt
not
be
exposed
to
intense
heat
some
persons
place
their
pots
in
the
earth
on
the
north
side
of
the
house
others
keep
them
in
a
porch
where
they
can
get
some
sun
they
require
much
more
water
in
summer
the
wax
plant
blooms
beautifully
in
summer
and
should
be
kept
in
a
sheltered
situation
not
exposed
to
the
wind
it
should
have
a
strong
frame
of
wood
and
wire
to
run
on
well
secured
in
a
tub
or
box
hyacinths
and
crocuses
should
be
planted
in
pots
boxes
or
small
tubs
in
rich
earth
in
october
or
november
a
small
painted
tub
is
very
suitable
and
will
hold
a
dozen
hyacinths
and
as
many
crocus
roots
the
most
beautiful
i
ever
saw
in
a
window
were
planted
in
this
way
by
keeping
some
in
the
sun
and
others
in
the
shade
you
can
have
a
succession
of
blooms
they
are
also
pretty
in
root
glasses
but
this
plan
will
exhaust
the
roots
after
blooming
in
the
house
they
should
be
planted
in
the
garden
the
same
roots
will
not
answer
the
next
year
for
parlor
culture
they
increase
very
fast
in
the
garden
by
proper
care
there
is
something
refining
to
the
mind
in
the
cultivation
of
flowers
either
in
a
garden
or
in
pots
many
hours
that
would
be
weary
or
lonely
are
thus
pleasantly
occupied
and
the
mind
refreshed
