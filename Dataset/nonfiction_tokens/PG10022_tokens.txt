africa
is
the
country
of
nigeria
the
chief
city
is
calabar
said
mother
slessor
it
is
a
dark
country
because
the
light
of
the
gospel
is
not
shining
brightly
there
black
people
live
there
many
of
these
are
cannibals
who
eat
other
people
they
bad
people
are
they
mother
asked
little
susan
yes
they
are
bad
because
no
one
has
told
them
about
jesus
the
saviour
from
sin
or
showed
them
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
do
they
have
any
missionaries
out
there
mother
asked
mary
yes
there
are
a
few
and
they
are
doing
wonderful
things
for
jesus
but
there
are
still
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
who
have
never
heard
a
missionary
they
need
many
many
more
missionaries

tossing
her
red
hair
about

ca
be
preachers

robert
i

mary
the
tears
racing
down
her
cheeks
when
i
a
missionary
said
robert
i
take
you
into
the
pulpit
with
me
this
made
mary
happy
and
she
was
much
happier
when

slessor
said

a

the
little

said
mother
slessor
in
dismay
as
the
tears

her
eyes
oh
robert
then
because
she
was
used
to
these
things
mother
slessor
heaved
a
sigh
and
said
quietly
come
and
eat
supper
robert
the
father
staggered
over
to
the
table
where
slessor
had
placed
the
plate
of
food
which
the
children
had
saved
out
of
their
own
small
helpings
that
he
might
have
something

said
father
slessor
and
he
threw
the
precious
food
into
the
fire
he
staggered
to
his
bed
and
fell
into
drunken
sleep
with
a
deep
sigh
mother
slessor
put
out
the
light
and
she
too
retired
for
the
night
early
the
next
morning
she
was
up
preparing
breakfast
carefully
she
scraped
every
bit
of
oatmeal
out
of
the
container
and
boiled
it
for
breakfast
come
children
it
time
to
get
up

this
morning
called
slessor
up
jumped
the
six
little
slessors
the
older
ones
helped
the
smaller
ones
get
dressed
when
they
had
eaten
the
little
oatmeal
that
slessor
had
for
breakfast
they
lined
up
for
inspection
john
declared
slessor
you
did
not
wash
behind
your
ears
go
with
mary
and
let
her
scrub
the
dirt
away
now
i
put

your
hankies
and
here
a
peppermint
for
each
of
you
there
off
we
go
to
sunday
school
and
church
father
slessor
snored
in
his
drunken
sleep
while
the
family
went
off
to
hear
god
word
and
to
sing
his
praises
when
they
returned
father
slessor
was
awake
he
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
holding
his
head
he
had
morning
after
sickness
come
robert
said
slessor
and
sit
up
to
the
table
good
elder
mcdougal
has
given
us
a
bit
of
meat
and
some
bread
so
we
can
eat
this
day
father
slessor
groaned
but
sat
up
to
the
table
and
ate
dinner
with
his
family
it
was
much
of
a
dinner
it
would
have
been
even
less
were
it
not
for
the
kindness
and
charity
of
friends
because
father
slessor
had
spent
all
their
money
for
drink
after
dinner
the
children
did
the
dishes
and
ran
out
to
play
when
they
were
alone
father
slessor
hung
his
head
and
said
oh
my
dear
what
can
i
say
i
am
so
ashamed
i
did
so
want
to
bring
my
wages
home
that
we
might
have
food
for
the
children
and
well
before
i
knew
it
my
wages
were
spent
robert
said
slessor
you
have
said
again
and
again
that
is
your
friends
who
lead
you
astray
would
it
not
be
well
to
move
away
to
some
other
town
where
you
can
find
new
friends
who
will
not
drink
and
who
will
not
tempt
you
to
drink
aye
my
dear
that
no
doubt
would
be
the
best
but
where
shall
we
go
i
have
heard
that
there
is
plenty
of
work
in
dundee
with
the
mills
and
all
let
sell
our
things
here
and
move
to
dundee
aye
let
us
do
that
is
certain
it
wo
be
worse
than
here
for
you
and
the
children
very
well
then
i
shall
tell
the
children
and
we
shall
move
before
the
week
is
out
when
mother
slessor
went
outside
to
call
the
children
she
found
mary
seated
on
the
steps
with
her
stick
dolls
about
her
well
mary
dear
what
are
you
doing
i
am
the
teacher
and
these
are
the
black
children
of
calabar
i
am
teaching
them
about
jesus
i
am
telling
them
that
he
saved
them
from
their
sins
mother
slessor
hugged
her
little
teacher
and
told
her
about
the
move
they
planned
to
make
then
the
other
children
were
called
and
told
too
there
was
much
excitement
especially
when
the
furniture
was
sold
and
the
slessors
with
their
remaining
possessions
took
the
train
to
dundee
it
did
not
take
long
to
find
a
place
and
get
settled
mother
slessor
at
once
looked
for
a
church
they
might
attend
she
found
the
wishart
church
named
for
the
famous
preacher
george
wishart
who
in
had
preached
near
the
place
where
the
church
was
built
shortly
afterward
he
was
killed
for
preaching
about
jesus
but
father
slessor
did
not
do
better
in
the
new
home
he
could
not
overcome
the
drink
habit
and
probably
did
not
try
very
hard
to
overcome
it
in
the
meantime
a
new
baby
came
to
the
slessor
home
they
called
the
baby
janie
how
happy
her
brothers
and
sisters
were
to
welcome
janie
mother
slessor
was
not
altogether
happy
because
she
knew
there
was
another
mouth
to
feed
father
slessor
promised
to
give
up
drinking
but
that
did
not
mean
anything
because
he
never
kept
those
promises
the
money
they
got
from
selling
their
furniture
in
aberdeen
slowly
melted
away
sickness
came
to
the
slessor
home
robert
junior
who
was
going
to
be
a
missionary
to
calabar
became
sick
and
died
two
other
of
the
children
also
died
and
only
mary
susan
john
and
janie
were
left
but
even
that
did
not
make
father
slessor
give
up
his
drinking
the
slessors
had
less
and
less
money
to
buy
food
at
last
slessor
went
to
work
in
one
of
the
factories
mary
had
to
take
care
of
the
home
but
the
wages
slessor
received
were
very
small
somehow
they
had
to
find
ways
of
getting
more
money
when
she
was
eleven
years
old
mary
went
to
work
in
the
factory
too
would
she
ever
get
a
chance
to
be
a
missionary
or
must
she
give
up
that
dream
mary
mary
called
slessor
it
five
time
to
get
up
and
go
to
work
ho
hum
said
mary
i
still
tired
but
i
get
right
up
i
do
want
to
be
late
at
six
in
the
morning
mary
was
at
work
she
had
to
tend
to
the
shuttles
on
the
weaving
machines
the
weaving
sheds
where
mary
worked
were
damp
and
dark
all
morning
long
she
heard
the
whirring
of
the
belts
and
the
clacking
of
the
looms
in
the
afternoon
she
went
to
school
by
the
time
she
was
fourteen
years
old
she
was
an
expert
weaver
she
now
began
to
work
full
time
the
hours
were
long
twelve
hours
every
day
for
six
days
a
week
the
girl
worked
in
the
factory
and
the
pay
was
very
small
but
it
was
a
joy
when
she
received
her
pay
on
saturday
night
mary
hurried
home
mother
mother
she
called
happily
as
she
hurried
into
the
house
here
is
the
money
i
earned
this
week
oh
mary
that
is
so
good
of
you
said
mother
slessor
she
wiped
tears
from
her
eyes
with
the
end
of
her
apron
she
felt
sad
that
mary
had
to
work
in
a
factory
she
thought
of
her
own
childhood
in
a
happy
home
where
there
was
always
plenty
to
eat
and
plenty
of
money
to
buy
things
that
were
needed
she
quickly
hid
mary
wages
in
the
same
place
where
she
hid
her
own
wages
so
that
her
husband
would
not
find
the
money
and
spend
it
for
drink
mary
did
not
lose
courage
by
the
long
hours
in
the
factory
she
remembered
that
david
livingstone
the
great
missionary
had
worked
in
a
weaving
factory
too
if
i
want
to
be
a
missionary
i
must
study
said
mary
when
can
i
find
time
again
mary
remembered
something
david
livingstone
did
when
he
was
a
boy
he
would
take
books
to
work
and
read
them
when
the
weaving
shuttles
were
working
right
and
did
not
have
to
have
someone
attend
to
them
mary
did
the
same
thing
she
read
many
books
from
the
sunday
school
library
she
read
books
like
milton
but
most
of
all
she
read
the
bible
conditions
at
home
grew
worse
mary
drunken
father
became
meaner
and
meaner
saturday
nights
were
the
worst
mary
and
her
mother
would
sit
waiting
after
the
younger
children
had
been
put
to
bed
for
the
father
to
stumble
home
one
night
he
was
so
mean
to
mary
she
had
to
run
out
of
the
house
to
get
away
from
him
the
whole
family
was
unhappy
because
of
slessor
sinful
habit
finally
one
morning
he
did
not
waken
from
the
drunken
sleep
in
the
night
his
soul
fled
to
face
the
judge
in
heaven
the
death
of
the
father
was
really
a
great
blessing
to
the
family
for
he
had
brought
them
only
sorrow
and
trouble
now
the
family
felt
free
the
load
they
had
borne
was
lifted
mary
at
once
began
to
take
a
more
active
part
in
church
work
if
i
want
to
be
a
missionary
i
better
have
some
practice
i
know
what
i
can
do
i
ask
the
sunday
school
superintendent
for
a
class
to
teach
she
did
and
was
given
a
class
of
girls
she
enjoyed
teaching
the
girls
very
much
she
called
them
her
lovable
lassies
but
mary
was
not
satisfied
she
wanted
to
get
more
practice
on
her
way
home
from
the
factory
mary
passed
through
the
slums
of
the
city
mary
herself
did
not
live
in
a
fine
house
in
fact
it
was
a
very
poor
one
but
in
the
slums
the
children
lived
in
small
dark
apartments
the
streets
on
which
they
played
were
narrow
and
dirty
the
children
here
did
not
know
about
the
saviour
they
grew
up
rough
and
tough
cursing
swearing
stealing
and
doing
many
mean
things
mary
heart
ached
for
these
children
of
the
slums
she
wanted
to
teach
them
that
jesus
could
make
them
happy
she
talked
with
many
people
about
it
at
last
her
church
opened
a
mission
in
the
worst
part
of
the
slums
mary
went
to
the
superintendent
i
want
to
teach
a
class
in
our
mission
said
mary
i
am
sure
you
can
use
me
better
there
than
you
can
here
but
mary
said
the
superintendent
you
are
doing
a
fine
job
here
in
the
church
why
do
you
want
to
go
to
the
mission
there
are
many
who
will
gladly
teach
a
class
here
at
the
church
but
not
so
many
who
are
willing
to
teach
at
the
mission
i
am
willing
i
will
teach
there
if
you
will
give
me
a
class
please
do
but
mary
those
children
are
tough
and
mean
you
could
handle
them
you
could
not
make
them
behave
you
are
hardly
more
than
a
child
yourself
oh
please
let
me
try
said
mary
i
do
so
want
to
tell
those
boys
and
girls
about
my
saviour
please
let
me
try
then
if
i
do
make
good
you
can
get
someone
else
in
my
place
very
well
said
the
superintendent
i
will
give
you
a
class
but
i
warn
you
those
children
are
tough
and
mean
and
hard
to
handle
brave
quit
pestering
us
to
come
to
church
if
you
do
let
us
alone
hurt
you
shouted
duncan
the
leader
of
a
group
of
tough
boys
in
the
slums
mary
prayed
god
to
make
her
brave
and
then
said
i
will
not
stop
trying
to
get
you
to
come
to
church
i
will
not
stop
trying
to
tell
you
about
jesus
the
saviour
do
whatever
you
like
these
boys
had
often
tried
to
interrupt
and
break
up
the
services
but
mary
went
out
into
the
streets
and
tried
to
persuade
and
coax
the
young
people
to
come
and
hear
the
word
of
god
all
right
then
said
duncan
here
goes
he
took
a
piece
of
lead
from
his
pocket
and
tied
it
to
a
long
string
he
began
to
swing
it
around
his
head
each
time
he
whirled
the
lead
it
came
closer
to
mary
face
mary
did
not
move
the
gang
watched
they
held
their
breath
as
it
came
closer
and
closer
to
her
blue
eyes
mary
did
not
blink
finally
it
grazed
her
forehead
still
mary
did
not
move
duncan
dropped
the
piece
of
lead
to
the
ground
we
ca
scare
her
boys
he
said
she
game
there
is
someone
who
is
far
braver
than
i
am
he
the
one
who
makes
me
brave
wo
you
come
to
the
services
and
hear
about
him
asked
mary
all
right
spunky
i
will
said
duncan
and
the
rest
of
the
fellows
will
too
come
on
boys
we
going
to
the
church
tonight
and
no
funny
business
this
was
not
the
only
time
that
mary
had
to
face
the
tough
boys
and
girls
of
the
slums
but
she
had
a
friend
who
was
closer
to
her
than
even
her
dear
mother
he
made
her
strong
and
brave
and
true
mary
loved
her
saviour
and
was
ready
to
do
whatever
he
might
want
her
to
do
her
class
grew
larger
all
the
time
she
visited
the
members
in
their
slum
homes
she
fitted
herself
into
the
family
if
the
baby
needed
tending
she
tended
to
it
if
someone
was
sick
she
helped
to
nurse
the
sick
person
always
she
told
the
family
about
christ
and
his
power
to
save
the
people
of
the
slums
came
to
love
this
home
missionary
and
many
of
them
were
won
to
christ
through
her
work
the
years
went
by
did
mary
still
remember
she
wanted
to
be
a
missionary
in
calabar
yes
she
remembered
but
now
she
had
all
she
could
do
to
support
her
family
since
robert
the
missionary
had
died
mother
slessor
hoped
that
her
youngest
son
john
would
be
a
missionary
but
god
had
other
plans
john
became
sick
he
was
sent
to
new
zealand
for
his
health
but
died
when
he
arrived
in
that
country
was
there
to
be
no
missionary
from
the
slessor
family
whenever
missionaries
came
to
the
wishart
church
or
to
dundee
mother
slessor
mary
susan
and
janie
would
go
to
hear
them
at
home
they
would
read
the
stories
of
missionaries
and
their
work
they
read
missionary
magazines
they
read
about
the
missionaries
in
china
africa
japan
india
and
even
calabar
one
day
william
anderson
a
missionary
to
the
west
coast
of
africa
came
to
the
little
church
he
told
of
the
great
need
for
missionaries
in
africa
he
told
of
the
bad
things
which
the
people
did
who
did
not
know
jesus
sitting
in
church
listening
to
the
missionary
mary
saw
in
her
mind
a
picture
of
africa
it
was
not
a
beautiful
picture
she
saw
captured
negroes
being
taken
to
other
lands
as
slaves
she
saw
alligators
and
crocodiles
swimming
in
the
muddy
waters
ever
ready
to
eat
black
children
who
would
come
too
close
to
the
river
she
saw
cannibal
chiefs
at
their
terrible
feasts
and
fearful
battles
with
spears
and
arrows
she
saw
villages
where
trembling
prisoners
dipped
their
hands
in
boiling
oil
to
test
their
guilt
where
wives
were
killed
to
go
with
their
dead
chief
into
the
spiritland
but
these
things
did
not
frighten
the
scottish
girl
who
was
afraid
to
cross
a
field
if
a
cow
was
in
it
she
longed
to
go
to
africa
why
do
i
become
a
missionary
mary
asked
herself
as
she
worked
the
looms
in
the
factory
can
i
leave
my
home
does
mother
still
need
my
help
susan
and
janie
are
working
now
they
could
get
along
without
me
but
will
i
be
brave
enough
there
are
tropical
jungles
and
black
men
who
eat
people
there
are
wild
animals
sicknesses
and
death
god
can
make
me
brave
to
face
all
of
these
things
mary
prayed
o
god
if
it
is
your
will
let
me
go
as
a
missionary
to
calabar
let
me
be
a
teacher
to
teach
these
black
people
the
story
of
salvation
you
have
commanded
us
your
disciples
to
carry
the
gospel
to
the
farthest
parts
of
the
earth
use
me
o
lord
to
help
carry
it
to
calabar
hear
me
for
the
sake
of
jesus
my
saviour
it
was
the
news
flashed
around
the
world
livingstone
is
dead
the
great
missionary
had
died
on
his
knees
in
africa
everywhere
people
were
talking
of
this
great
man
who
had
given
his
life
to
tell
the
people
of
africa
about
the
saviour
mary
made
up
her
mind
she
must
go
to
calabar
but
what
would
her
mother
say
and
if
her
mother
agreed
would
her
church
send
her
out
to
that
field
mary
went
to
her
mother
i
want
to
offer
myself
as
a
missionary
said
mary
slessor
to
her
mother
are
you
willing
my
child
i
willingly
let
you
go
you
make
a
fine
missionary
and
i
sure
god
will
be
with
you
thank
you
mother
said
mary
i
know
god
will
be
with
me
and
will
make
me
strong
and
brave
to
serve
him
mother
slessor
was
very
happy
there
was
going
to
be
a
missionary
in
the
family
after
all
but
there
were
some
people
who
did
not
agree
with
mother
slessor
they
shook
their
heads
in
doubt
others
thought
mary
was
very
foolish
to
risk
her
life
in
that
way
you
doing
real
well
at
the
factory
said
one
of
them
and
doing
missionary
work
right
down
there
at
the
mission
why
rush
away
to
those
people
way
off
in
africa
seems
to
me
missionary
work
ought
to
begin
at
home
yes
said
mary
it
should
begin
there
but
not
end
there
there
are
some
who
can
not
go
to
africa
they
can
do
the
work
at
home
if
god
lets
me
i
want
to
take
his
word
to
those
people
who
have
never
heard
of
him
or
his
love
the
next
year
mary
offered
herself
to
the
foreign
mission
board
of
her
church
she
asked
to
be
sent
to
calabar
then
she
waited
waiting
is
hard
sometimes
mary
had
to
wait
until
the
board
had
a
meeting
then
when
the
meeting
was
over
she
had
to
wait
for
the
secretary
of
the
board
of
foreign
missions
to
write
her
a
letter
early
in
the
letter
came
how
excited
mary
was
her
hands
shook
as
she
tried
to
open
the
letter
had
they
accepted
her
offer
or
refused
it
mary
dear
said
her
mother

are
so
nervous
you
had
better
let
me
open
that
letter
i
manage
mother
said
mary
she
finally
got
it
open
and
she
read

pleasure
in

mother
slessor
that

for
joy
in
march
another
letter
came

letter

her
that
she
was
to
spend
three
months
at
a
teachers
college
in
edinburgh
all
mary
friends
in
dundee
gathered
at
the
train
as
she
got
ready
to
leave
for
edinburgh
come
mary
said
duncan
the
tough
boy
from
the
slums
who
was
now
a
grown
man
and
a
faithful
worker
at
the
mission
give
us
a
speech
i
ca
make
a
speech
said
mary
but
i
just
ask
you
this
pray
for
me
while
mary
was
at
the
school
in
edinburgh
some
of
the
other
girls
she
met
there
tried
to
talk
her
out
of
being
a
missionary
they
did
not
want
her
to
go
off
to
africa
where
there
were
wild
animals
and
heathen
and
all
kinds
of
terrible
sicknesses
do
you
know
that
calabar
is
the
white
man
grave
asked
one
of
her
school
friends
yes
answered
mary
but
it
is
also
a
post
of
honor
since
few
volunteer
for
that
section
i
wish
to
go
because
my
master
needs
me
there
at
last
the
time
had
come
for
mary
to
leave
for
africa
for
fourteen
long
years
she
had
worked
at
the
looms
in
the
weaving
factory
as
she
worked
she
had
dreamed
of
calabar
now
her
dream
was
going
to
come
true
mary
went
to
the
city
of
liverpool
there
she
went
on
board
the
ship
the
s
ethiopia
as
she
got
on
board
she
looked
around
everywhere
were
barrels
of
whiskey
hundreds
of
barrels
of
whiskey
but
only
one
missionary
said
mary
sadly
the
boat
whistle
blew
the
engines
chugged
the
ethiopia
was
on
its
way
it
was
august
mary
saw
the
shoreline
of
scotland
become
dimmer
and
dimmer
she
looked
forward
to
seeing
the
coast
of
africa
and
the
land
of
calabar
at
last
i
am
on
my
way
to
calabar
said
mary
slessor
as
the
ethiopia
sailed
southward
how
mother
would
like
to
be
with
me
how
often
she
prayed
that
god
would
send
more
missionaries
to
calabar
i
did
think
then
that
i
would
really
be
one
of
them
it
did
not
take
mary
long
to
make
friends
on
board
the
ship
among
the
friends
she
made
were
and
thomson
so
you
are
going
to
calabar
said
thomson
are
you
afraid
of
that
wild
country
oh
no
said
mary
because
god
is
with
me
he
will
take
care
of
me
jesus
said
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
and
i
am
trusting
in
his
promise
do
you
know
what
this
country
is
like
asked
thomson
only
what
i
have
read
about
it
said
mary
you
been
there
before
have
you
yes
we
have
said
thomson
my
husband
wants
to
build
a
home
where
tired
missionaries
can
rest
and
rebuild
their
strength
for
their
wonderful
work
he
has
explored
the
west
coast
and
chosen
the
cameroon
mountains
as
the
place
for
that
home
we
are
going
there
now
to
build
this
home
for
missionaries
missionary
work
in
africa
is
so
hard
that
missionaries
need
a
place
where
they
can
rest
from
time
to
time
i
think
that
wonderful
of
you
said
mary
i
know
the
lord
will
bless
the
work
you
are
doing
wo
you
tell
me
about
africa
well
said
thomson
the
climate
is
very
hot
the
sun
is
so
strong
and
hot
that
white
people
do
dare
go
out
without
a
hat
to
protect
their
heads
the
rivers
are
very
muddy
and
often
flow
through
dark
gloomy
swamps
that
white
people
can
hardly
get
through
but
often
broke
in
thomson
there
are
beautiful
green
banks
with
the
most
beautiful
flowers
you
will
see
the
prettiest
birds
in
all
the
world
dressed
in
the
brightest
reds
and
greens
and
blues
and
purples
you
will
see
the
cranes
and
the
funny
pelicans
with
their
big
beaks
and
do
forget
the
crocodiles
that
are
swimming
in
the
river
or
lying
on
the
banks
they
look
like
an
old
log
but
if
you
get
near
them
look
out
they
seem
lazy
and
slow
but
they
can
snap
off
a
leg
or
drag
you
into
the
river
as
quick
as
a
wink
then
in
the
jungles
are
the
lions
and
elephants
and
other
wild
animals
i
am
most
frightened
of
the
swift
and
terrible
tornadoes
said
thomson
and
miss
slessor
said
thomson
do
forget
that
the
natives
are
wild
and
fierce
and
many
of
them
are
cannibals
who
would
be
glad
to
eat
you
i
shall
not
fear
said
mary
god
is
leading
me
he
is
my
good
shepherd
he
can
protect
me
from
fierce
beasts
and
the
wild
people
i
am
happy
he
has
chosen
me
to
bring
the
messages
of
the
saviour
to
these
wild
people
he
will
call
me
home
to
him
when
the
work
he
has
for
me
is
done
till
then
nothing
can
really
harm
me
four
weeks
passed
the
ship
was
plowing
through
the
tropical
sea
the
air
was
warm
but
the
sea
breezes
made
it
very
pleasant
the
ship
turned
landward
and
soon
mary
could
see
the
shore
of
africa
how
thrilled
and
happy
she
was
africa
at
last
on
september
the
ship
entered
the
tumbling
whirling
waters
of
the
cross
and
calabar
rivers
which
here
joined
and
poured
into
the
sea
mary
had
read
about
these
rivers
and
now
she
actually
saw
them
she
saw
too
the
pelicans
and
the
cranes
she
saw
crocodiles
about
which
thomson
had
told
her
lazily
slide
off
the
sandbanks
into
the
muddy
waters
of
the
river
and
thomson
stood
with
mary
at
the
rail
of
the
ship
as
it
sailed
up
the
river
they
would
point
out
to
her
interesting
sights
as
they
passed
along
look
said
thomson
there
is
duke
town
that
is
where
your
mission
is
mary
saw
clay
cliffs
she
saw
mud
houses
with
roofs
of
palm
leaves
duke
town
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
dundee
or
the
other
cities
in
scotland
which
mary
knew
duke
town
did
not
look
pretty
but
mary
did
not
care
to
her
it
looked
beautiful
because
here
she
would
have
the
chance
to
serve
the
lord
soon
native
canoes
came
out
to
the
steamer
then
the
boats
of
the
traders
all
was
hurry
and
bustle
as
the
great
ship
anchored
and
prepared
to
unload
the
part
of
its
cargo
that
had
been
sent
to
duke
town
mary
looked
about
wondering
how
she
was
going
to
go
ashore
a
tall
negro
came
up
to
mary
he
bowed
and
said
are
you
the
new
white
ma
that
is
coming
to
the
mission
by
ma
the
native
meant
lady
they
called
all
white
ladies
ma
yes
i
am
said
mary
anderson
sent
me
to
bring
you
ashore
and
take
you
to
the
mission
house
mary
was
lowered
from
the
great
ship
into
a
large
canoe
her
baggage
was
brought
down
and
placed
in
the
boat
then
with
powerful
strokes
the
rowers
sent
the
boat
skimming
across
the
water
toward
duke
town
mary
was
helped
ashore
by
the
tall
negro
who
had
come
for
her
at
last
she
said
to
herself
at
last
i
am
in
calabar
welcome
welcome
mary
said
mammy
anderson
as
she
hugged
mary
mammy
anderson
and
her
husband
william
anderson
were
among
the
first
missionaries
at
duke
town
in
calabar
this

daddy
anderson
said
mammy
anderson
and
daddy
this
is
mary
slessor
just
come
from
bonny
scotland
to
help
us
daddy
and
mary
shook
hands
long
ago
you
preached
in
our
church
in
dundee
said
mary
you
told
how
many
missionaries
were
needed
i
wished
then
i
could
help
you
i
hope
i
can
mary
liked
this
fine
christian
couple
from
the
start
the
mission
house
where
they
lived
was
high
on
a
hill
above
the
town
mammy
took
mary
around
the
house
and
the
yard
which
they
called
a
compound
she
showed
mary
where
the
workers
stayed
who
helped
at
the
mission
house
she
showed
her
the
school
where
the
little
black
children
were
taught
to
read
and
write
and
told
of
the
dear
saviour
who
had
died
for
them
too
that
they
might
be
saved
from
sin
and
hell
and
go
to
heaven
and
here
said
mammy
is
the
bell
i
am
putting
you
right
to
work
one
of
your
jobs
will
be
to
ring
the
rising
bell
for
morning
prayers
you
ring
this
at
six
then
everyone
will
get
up
and
we
will
have
prayers
in
the
chapel
that
was
mary
first
job
but
alas
mary
often
overslept
and
did
not
ring
the
rising
bell
in
time
one
morning
she
awoke
and
saw
that
it
was
very
bright
outside
dear
me
said
mary
i
overslept
again
she
jumped
out
of
bed
slipped
into
her
clothes
and
rang
the
bell
loud
and
long
soon
the
workers
began
coming
rubbing
their
eyes
and
yawning
what
the
idea
of
ringing
the
bell
now
asked
one
of
them
it
much
too
early
but
look
how
bright
it
is
said
mary
daddy
anderson
laughed
mary
mary
he
said
it
only
two
in
the
morning
the
light
you
see
is
our
bright
tropical
moon
it
not
the
sun
and
all
the
workers
laughed
and
mary
laughed
with
them
i
guess
i
not
a
very
good
she
said
mary
real
job
was
to
teach
the
children
in
the
school
on
mission
hill
she
remembered
how
she
had
played
when
she
was
a
little
girl
that
she
was
teaching
the
children
of
calabar
now
she
was
really
doing
it
she
loved
the
little
black
children
after
school
she
would
take
long
walks
with
them
into
the
bush
there
they
saw
beautiful
birds
of
many
bright
colors
and
beautiful
flowers
of
all
kinds
mary
ran
races
with
the
black
children
how
they
loved
that
she
climbed
trees
as
fast
as
any
boy
the
black
children
loved
their
white
ma
who
taught
them
and
played
with
them
but
playing
with
the
children
often
made
mary
late
for
meals
mary
mary
scolded
mammy
anderson
gently
you
are
late
again
i
am
going
to
punish
you
you
go
to
your
room
since
supper
is
over
you
just
have
to
go
to
bed
without
it
mary
went
to
her
room
in
a
little
while
she
heard
a
knock
at
her
door
it
daddy
mary
said
a
deep
voice
please
open
your
door
mary
opened
the
door
there
stood
daddy
anderson
with
his
hands
full
of
biscuits
and
bananas
which
he
was
bringing
to
her
with
mammy
consent
i
thought
you
might
be
hungry
said
daddy
anderson
you
and
mammy
are
perfect
dears
said
mary
i
do
deserve
all
your
kindness
mary
soon
began
to
visit
the
different
yards
or
compounds
in
duke
town
missionaries
had
been
here
for
thirty
years
but
there
many
of
them
they
worked
chiefly
in
duke
town
old
town
and
creek
town
three
towns
at
the
mouth
of
the
calabar
river
they
also
had
opened
a
station
at
ikunetu
and
ikorofiong
on
the
cross
river
one
day
mary
was
at
one
of
the
stations
with
another
missionary
when
he
finished
his
talk
he
said
mary
wo
you
speak
to
these
people
mary
stood
up
please
read
john
she
said
the
missionary
did
then
mary
told
the
people
how
they
could
be
born
again
she
told
them
of
the
joy
that
they
would
have
if
they
took
jesus
into
their
hearts
she
told
them
of
the
hope
of
life
after
death
with
god
in
heaven
the
natives
listened
they
liked
her
talk
after
that
whenever
she
came
to
that
district
crowds
would
come
to
hear
her
speak
mammy
said
mary
after
she
had
come
from
a
trip
to
the
outstations
it
hurts
my
heart
to
see
how
cruel
these
people
are
and
those
awful
ugly
cruel
gods
they
pray
to
the
chiefs
are
so
cruel
and
mean
and
have
no
mercy
and
then
that
terrible
secret
society
the
egbo
i
saw
some
of
their
runners
dressed
in
fearful
costumes
scaring
the
people
and
whipping
them
with
long
whips
i
saw
a
poor
man
whom
they
had
beaten
almost
to
death
then
there
is
that
horrible
drinking
they
are
worse
than
wild
animals
when
they
become
drunk
and
worst
of
all
is
that
they
have
slaves
and
sell
their
own
people
as
slaves
ah
lassie
said
mammy
anderson
you
have
seen
anything
yet
there
are
millions
of
these
black
people
in
the
bush
and
far
back
in
the
interior
most
of
them
are
slaves
they
do
treat
a
slave
any
better
than
a
pig
the
slaves
sleep
on
the
ground
like
animals
they
are
branded
with
a
hot
iron
just
as
animals
are
and
just
as
the
farmers
back
home
fatten
a
pig
for
market
so
the
girls
are
fattened
and
sold
for
slave
wives
the
slaves
can
be
whipped
or
sold
or
killed
when
a
chief
dies
the
tribe
cuts
off
the
heads
of
his
wives
and
slaves
and
they
are
buried
with
him
the
tribes
are
wild
and
cruel
many
of
them
are
cannibals
who
eat
people
they
spend
their
lives
in
fighting
dancing
and
drinking
but
the
way
they
treat
twins
is
one
of
the
worst
things
they
do
what
do
they
do
to
twins
asked
mary
they
kill
them
said
mammy
anderson
sometimes
they
bury
the
twins
alive
and
sometimes
they
just
throw
them
out
into
the
bush
to
die
of
hunger
the
mother
is
driven
into
the
bush
no
one
will
have
anything
to
do
with
her
she
is
left
to
die
in
the
jungle
or
to
be
eaten
by
the
wild
animals
but
why
do
they
do
such
cruel
wicked
things
to
harmless
babies
asked
mary
they
believe
that
the
father
of
one
of
the
twins
is
an
evil
spirit
or
devil
but
they
do
know
which
one
father
was
a
devil
so
they
kill
both
to
be
sure
of
getting
the
right
one
that
must
be
stopped
said
mary
i
will
fight
it
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
never
give
up
jesus
loves
twins
just
as
much
as
other
children
the
natives
must
learn
that
they
must
learn
that
god
said
shalt
not
kill
i
teach
them
mary
made
many
friends
not
only
among
the
children
whom
she
taught
but
also
among
the
natives
one
day
she
heard
a
chief
speaking
to
his
people
about
god
and
his
love
he
was
a
christian
mary
thought
that
he
made
a
very
fine
talk
she
could
tell
he
was
very
sincere
he
talked
so
that
everyone
could
understand
him
who
is
that
chief
asked
mary
of
the
man
standing
next
to
her
that
is
king
eyo
honesty
vii
said
the
man
king
eyo
honesty
i
must
talk
to
him
as
soon
as
she
could
mary
went
up
to
the
chief
king
eyo
honesty
said
mary
i
am
mary
slessor
many
years
ago
the
missionaries
told
my
mother
about
you
they
told
her
what
a
fine
christian
you
were
she
told
us
she
will
be
very
happy
when
i
tell
her
that
i
have
met
you
i
am
very
happy
to
have
met
you
said
king
eyo
honesty
perhaps
i
could
write
a
letter
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
how
happy
i
am
that
i
have
met
you
i
would
tell
her
how
happy
i
am
that
her
daughter
has
come
to
teach
my
people
about
god
mother
would
be
very
happy
i
know
to
get
a
letter
from
you
for
many
years
the
african
chief
and
mary
scottish
mother
wrote
letters
to
one
another
every
day
when
school
was
over
mary
went
to
visit
the
natives
in
their
homes
she
would
tell
them
about
jesus
and
how
he
loved
them
she
told
them
jesus
wanted
to
save
them
she
told
them
that
jesus
had
paid
for
their
sins
by
dying
for
them
if
they
loved
and
trusted
in
jesus
he
would
take
their
sins
away
one
sunday
morning
as
she
was
walking
through
the
village
she
saw
one
of
the
old
men
who
came
to
church
all
the
time
sitting
at
the
door
of
his
mud
house
he
looked
very
sad
ekpo
said
mary
why
are
you
on
your
way
to
god
house
anderson
will
be
looking
for
you
he
will
miss
you
if
your
heart
were
sad
would
you
go
any
place
asked
ekpo
but
why
is
your
heart
sad
my
son
my
only
son
is
dead
even
now
he
is
buried
in
the
house
ekpo
let
me
tell
you
a
story
said
mary
a
long
time
ago
there
were
two
sisters
they
had
a
brother
they
loved
him
very
much
they
loved
him
like
you
loved
your
son
he
became
sick
the
two
sisters
sent
a
messenger
to
jesus
to
tell
him
when
jesus
came
the
brother
was
dead
martha
the
one
sister
said
to
jesus
if
you
had
been
here
my
brother
would
not
have
died
i
know
that
even
now
god
will
give
you
whatever
you
ask
him
jesus
said
brother
will
get
up
from
the
grave
martha
said
know
that
he
will
get
up
from
the
grave
in
the
resurrection
at
the
last
day
when
all
the
dead
shall
come
out
of
their
graves
jesus
said
to
her
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
who
believes
in
me
even
though
he
dies
he
will
live
whoever
lives
and
believes
in
me
shall
never
die
did
the
brother
get
up
from
the
grave
yes
jesus
went
to
the
grave
and
said
come
out
and
lazarus
did
but
ekpo
later
lazarus
died
again
then
his
body
stayed
in
the
grave
but
his
soul
was
with
god
he
was
happy
all
christians
are
happy
with
god
your
son
was
a
christian
was
he
oh
yes
ma
he
was
said
ekpo
wife
who
had
come
to
the
door
while
mary
was
talking
then
do
you
see
god
has
taken
him
he
is
with
god
he
is
happy
if
you
believe
in
jesus
then
some
day
you
too
will
be
with
god
and
will
see
your
son
again
well
said
ekpo
if
god
has
taken
him
it
is
not
so
bad
come
then
said
mary
let
go
to
god
house
and
thank
him
that
your
son
was
a
christian
and
is
now
with
god
in
heaven
mary
knew
there
was
a
great
deal
to
do
there
were
so
many
people
who
did
not
know
about
jesus
there
were
so
many
who
were
terribly
mean
and
cruel
but
mary
knew
that
with
the
lord
on
her
side
she
would
not
lose
in
the
fight
against
sin
and
wickedness
every
day
she
would
tell
the
natives
about
jesus
every
day
she
would
show
them
their
sins
and
the
saviour
for
three
years
mary
worked
hard
then
she
became
sick
it
was
the
terrible
coast
fever
sometimes
she
was
so
sick
she
did
not
know
what
was
happening
she
was
very
tired
she
wished
that
she
could
see
her
mother
and
sisters
calabar
needs
a
brave
heart
and
a
strong
body
said
mary
i
do
have
much
of
a
brave
heart
but
i
often
feel
the
need
of
it
when
i
am
sick
and
lonely
mary
you
must
go
home
to
scotland
and
rest
said
mammy
anderson
then
you
will
get
well
from
the
fever
you
will
never
get
well
here
that
true
mammy
said
mary
but
you
know
that
i
can
not
leave
my
field
of
work
was
until
the
board
of
missions
says
i
may
that
right
but
you
have
a
furlough
coming
i
do
hope
we
hear
from
the
board
soon
in
june
the
letter
came
mary
read
it
gladly
it
told
her
that
she
could
come
home
for
a
year
vacation
it
did
not
take
mary
long
to
pack
she
left
for
scotland
on
the
next
steamer
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
stood
on
the
deck
there
on
the
shore
were
her
black
friends
waving
to
their
white
ma
they
were
crying
too
come
back
again
come
back
again
god
bless
you
and
keep
you
they
said
mary
waved
to
them
i
will
be
back
she
said
mary
loved
africa
she
loved
the
people
there
but
she
knew
if
she
wanted
to
get
well
she
would
have
to
go
home
then
too
she
was
anxious
to
see
her
mother
and
sisters
again
the
ocean
trip
did
mary
much
good
the
cool
ocean
breezes
blew
the
fever
away
it
made
her
cheeks
pink
again
every
day
she
prayed
for
the
people
of
africa
she
prayed
that
she
might
go
back
again
she
prayed
that
more
missionaries
would
be
sent
out
to
show
these
poor
people
the
way
to
heaven
how
happy
mary
mother
and
two
sisters
were
to
have
her
with
them
again
and
how
happy
mary
was
to
be
with
them
they
could
not
hear
enough
about
calabar
it
made
mary
mother
very
happy
to
know
that
her
daughter
had
taught
the
black
children
the
way
to
heaven
she
was
glad
to
hear
about
the
other
missionary
work
which
mary
had
done
but
other
people
too
were
anxious
to
hear
about
calabar
so
mary
had
to
speak
at
wishart
church
and
other
churches
mary
told
about
the
heathen
the
wicked
things
the
heathen
natives
did
to
twins
the
mean
way
they
treated
slaves
and
the
many
other
cruel
wicked
things
these
people
did
there
is
only
one
thing
that
will
change
these
people
said
mary
there
is
only
one
thing
that
will
turn
these
heathen
from
their
sins
that
is
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
the
good
news
about
the
saviour
but
who
will
tell
these
people
about
jesus
we
need
many
many
more
missionaries
if
you
can
not
go
yourself
you
can
send
gifts
and
offerings
for
this
work
we
need
money
so
the
missionaries
can
buy
food
and
clothing
we
need
money
so
that
they
can
build
homes
and
churches
and
hospitals
have
pity
on
these
poor
people
pity
the
poor
little
children
help
them
now
above
all
pray
for
these
people
and
pray
for
your
missionaries
that
god
will
bless
their
work
with
these
lost
souls
everywhere
mary
went
she
won
friends
for
calabar
the
people
who
heard
mary
wanted
to
help
make
christians
of
the
heathen
people
many
prayed
many
gave
men
and
women
gave
gifts
of
money
for
the
work
boys
and
girls
brought
their
little
gifts
too
they
knew
the
hymn
if
you
can
not
give
your
thousands
you
can
give
the
widow
mite
and
each
gift
you
give
for
jesus
will
be
precious
in
his
sight
slessor
was
not
well
living
in
the
crowded
dusty
smoky
city
made
her
sick
mary
found
a
little
home
out
in
the
country
here
were
clear
blue
skies
and
pleasant
fields
mary
mother
was
much
better
after
they
moved
her
mary
sisters
enjoyed
it
also
the
months
passed
quickly
soon
the
year
would
be
over
what
do
you
want
to
do
when
you
go
back

slessor
i
want
to
go
on
up
the
river
i
want
to
go
where
missionaries

never
been
i
want
to
go
to
okoyong
and

the
people
there
about
jesus
i
am
praying
god
that

or
later
he
will
let
me
go
and

there
is
it
much
more
dangerous
there
asked
slessor
yes

mary
but
i
am
not
afraid
because
i
know
that
god
is
with
me
and
his
angels
are
watching
over
me
june
came
mary
had
been
home
a
year
now
she
was
in
good
health
again
she
wanted
to
get
back
to
africa
july
august
september
went
by
and
then
the
good
news
came
mary
was
to
leave
in
october
for
calabar
it
was
a
happy
day
for
her
when
she
got
on
the
ship
that
would
take
her
back
to
the
africa
she
loved
on
the
ship
she
found
the
rev
and
hugh
goldie
they
too
had
been
missionaries
in
calabar
for
many
years
and
now
after
a
short
vacation
were
going
back
once
more
all
the
way
to
africa
the
friend
talked
about
the
great
work
of
winning
souls
for
jesus
especially
the
souls
of
the
people
of
calabar
at
last
the
big
steamship
entered
the
mouth
of
the
calabar
and
cross
rivers
it
was
not
far
now
to
duke
town
soon
mary
would
learn
what
work
she
should
do
would
it
be
work
she
wanted
to
do
would
it
be
work
in
the
jungles
mary
would
soon
know
her
mary
how
would
you
like
to
have
a
mission
station
of
your
own
asked
daddy
anderson
why
i
love
it
answered
mary
it
is
hard
work
and
very
unpleasant
at
times
said
daddy
anderson
i
do
care
how
hard
or
unpleasant
it
is
said
mary
as
long
as
i
can
work
for
my
lord
good
then
you
will
be
in
charge
of
the
old
town
station
two
miles
up
the
river
it
did
not
take
mary
long
to
pack
her
things
and
move
to
old
town
but
what
a
sight
greeted
her
when
she
arrived
the
first
thing
she
saw
as
she
came
into
the
village
was
a
man
skull
hanging
from
the
end
of
a
pole
and
swinging
slowly
in
the
breeze
where
is
the
mission
house
asked
mary
of
one
of
the
natives
down
that
way
at
the
end
of
the
road
ma
he
answered
mary
found
the
mission
house
it
was
an
old
shack
it
was
made
of
long
twigs
and
branches
daubed
over
with
mud
the
roof
was
made
of
palm
leaves
it
was
not
nearly
as
nice
a
home
as
the
one
on
mission
hill
in
duke
town
when
mary
went
inside
she
found
that
it
was
whitewashed
and
somewhat
clean
mary
got
busy
cleaning
up
her
house
and
as
she
did
she
began
to
make
her
plans
i
do
care
if
my
house
is
not
so
fine
i
am
nearer
to
the
jungles
i
want
to
get
into
the
jungles
sometime
and
win
those
poor
ignorant
heathen
people
for
jesus
i
am
going
to
live
in
a
house
like
the
natives
and
use
the
tools
and
things
they
do
only
i
be
a
lot
cleaner
then
they
will
feel
that
i
am
one
of
them
and
i
be
better
able
to
win
them
for
jesus
then
too
it
cheaper
to
live
that
way
and
to
eat
bananas
i
will
be
able
to
send
more
money
home
to
my
poor
mother
in
scotland
living
this
way
will
also
help
me
get
ready
for
the
time
when
i
can
go
into
the
jungles
then
i
will
have
to
live
that
way
mary
held
services
every
sunday
she
started
a
day
school
for
the
children
the
grownups
came
too
mary
was
so
friendly
and
kind
that
the
natives
loved
her
more
and
more
came
to
hear
about
jesus
mary
showed
them
that
he
was
the
saviour
of
the
blacks
and
whites
alike
many
came
from
faraway
places
to
hear
the
white
ma
and
go
to
her
school
mary
soon
visited
all
the
villages
in
the
neighborhood
and
every
place
she
went
she
would
tell
the
people
about
jesus
at
one
place
the
king
of
that
part
of
the
country
came
regularly
to
hear
the
white
ma
he
would
sit
on
the
bench
with
the
little
children
and
listen
to
mary
tell
about
the
saviour
who
loves
all
people
one
thing
still
bothered
mary
very
much
this
was
the
way
the
natives
treated
twins
as
soon
as
twins
were
born
they
would
break
the
backs
and
stuff
the
little
bodies
into
a
jar
made
out
of
a
big
gourd
then
they
would
throw
the
jar
out
into
the
jungle
the
mother
would
be
sent
away
out
into
the
jungle
to
die
it
is
very
wicked
for
you
to
kill
these
twin
babies
said
mary
to
the
people
it
is
a
sin
against
god
who
said
shall
not
kill
people
jesus
loves
all
children
he
loves
the
twin
babies
too
the
natives
would
not
listen
to
her
they
were
afraid
of
the
evil
spirits
one
day
mary
heard
about
some
twins
that
were
born
she
rushed
over
to
the
house
and
took
the
babies
before
they
were
killed
she
brought
them
to
her
house
and
took
care
of
them
she
will
have
lots
of
trouble
taking
an
evil
spirit
into
her
house
said
one
of
the
natives
just
you
wait
and
see
maybe
she
is
a
friend
of
the
evil
spirit
said
another
but
weeks
and
months
went
by
and
nothing
happened
the
people
began
to
see
that
mary
was
right
everywhere
the
people
began
to
call
mary
the
white
ma
who
loves
babies
another
wicked
thing
the
people
did
was
to
kill
the
babies
of
slaves
who
died
they
did
not
want
to
bother
taking
care
of
them
so
they
killed
them
mary
began
to
take
these
little
orphans
into
her
home
and
take
care
of
them
but
it
began
to
be
too
much
work
for
mary
alone
she
wrote
a
letter
to
the
mission
board
asking
for
someone
to
take
care
of
these
children
one
day
a
trader
came
and
knocked
at
mary
door
he
was
carrying
a
little
black
baby
in
his
arms
i
found
this
twin
out
in
the
bush
said
the
trader
the
other
one
was
killed
this
baby
would
have
died
but
i
know
how
you
love
these
little
ones
so
i
brought
it
to
you
thank
you
said
mary
taking
the
tiny
baby
in
her
arms
i
shall
call
her
janie
after
my
sister
mary
adopted
the
little
baby
and
the
baby
brought
mary
much
joy
and
happiness
one
time
mary
took
a
baby
six
months
old
into
the
mountains
the
baby
was
sick
in
the
valley
it
was
very
hot
this
child
shall
not
die
if
the
cold
can
save
him
said
mary
up
in
the
mountains
it
was
much
cooler
than
in
the
valley
mary
pitched
her
tent
and
stayed
there
for
a
time
so
the
baby
could
get
well
one
night
mary
woke
up
she
heard
a
growling
noise
she
looked
around
a
panther
was
in
the
tent
he
had
the
baby
in
his
mouth
he
was
going
to
carry
it
away
mary
jumped
up
she
grabbed
a
burning
stick
from
the
fire
and
rammed
it
into
the
panther
face
with
a
wild
howl
the
panther
dropped
the
baby
and
ran
off
mary
picked
up
the
baby
who
was
crying
now
she
looked
him
over
carefully
he
was
not
hurt
softly
she
sang
to
the
baby
and
rocked
him
to
sleep
after
the
baby
was
well
mary
went
back
to
the
mission
station
in
the
valley
another
time
news
came
that
twins
had
been
born
all
the
people
had
thought
a
lot
of
the
mother
even
though
she
was
a
slave
now
everyone
hated
her
the
other
women
in
the
house
cursed
her
they
broke
up
the
few
dishes
she
owned
they
tore
up
her
clothes
they
would
have
killed
her
but
they
were
afraid
of
mary
slessor
and
what
she
would
do
they
took
the
two
babies
and
stuffed
them
into
an
empty
gin
box
and
shoved
it
at
the
woman
get
out
get
out
they
said
you
have
married
the
devil
you
have
a
devil
in
you
they
threw
rocks
at
her
and
drove
her
out
of
the
village
mary
met
the
poor
woman
carrying
her
babies
in
the
box
on
her
head
the
screaming
howling
crowd
of
people
were
following
her
go
back
go
back
to
your
village
mary
told
the
crowd
then
turning
to
the
woman
she
said
give
me
the
box
and
come
with
me
to
my
house
when
mary
opened
the
box
she
found
one
child
dead
the
baby
head
had
been
smashed
when
it
was
jammed
into
the
box
mary
buried
the
poor
little
baby
soon
the
owner
of
the
woman
came
and
took
her
back
she
was
willing
to
do
this
as
long
as
she
had
no
children
the
little
baby
stayed
with
mary
and
became
another
of
her
family
one
evening
mary
was
sitting
on
the
porch
of
her
mission
house
talking
to
the
children
suddenly
they
heard
a
loud
noise
they
heard
the
beating
of
drums
then
they
heard
men
singing
loudly
what
that
asked
mary
she
took
the
twin
boys
that
were
with
her
and
rushed
down
to
the
road
to
see
what
was
going
on
here
she
found
a
crowd
of
people
they
were
all
dressed
up
some
wore
hats
with
long
feathers
hanging
down
some
had
crowns
some
wore
masks
with
animal
heads
and
horns
some
put
on
uniforms
with
gold
and
silver
lace
some
just
covered
their
bodies
with
beadwork
and
tablecloths
trimmed
with
gold
and
silver
when
mary
came
the
shouting
stopped
the
king
came
forward
to
meet
her
ma
said
the
king
we
have
had
a
palaver
we
have
made
new
laws
the
old
laws
were
not
god
laws
now
all
twins
and
their
mothers
can
live
in
town
if
anyone
kills
twin
babies
or
hurts
the
mothers
he
shall
be
hung
god
will
bless
you
for
making
those
wise
laws
said
mary
the
mothers
of
the
twins
who
lived
at
the
mission
and
other
mothers
too
gathered
around
mary
they
laughed
and
shouted
they
clapped
their
hands
and
with
tears
running
down
their
cheeks
cried
thank
you
thank
you
they
made
so
much
noise
that
mary
asked
the
chief
to
stop
them
ma
how
can
i
stop
these
women
mouths
asked
the
chief
how
can
i
do
it
they
be
women
mary
was
happy
but
after
a
while
some
of
the
people
began
to
forget
the
new
laws
quietly
and
underhandedly
they
began
to
go
back
to
doing
the
old
bad
things
again
this
was
because
they
were
not
christians
they
did
not
love
and
trust
the
saviour
mary
knew
that
the
main
thing
to
do
if
she
were
to
get
them
to
live
right
and
do
right
was
to
change
their
hearts
new
laws
could
not
really
change
them
only
faith
in
jesus
could
do
that
i
must
help
them
more
i
must
lead
more
of
them
to
jesus
said
mary
many
are
sick
i
will
give
them
medicine
and
at
the
same
time
tell
them
about
jesus
who
makes
the
soul
well
and
the
body
too
as
mary
gave
out
medicine
many
people
would
often
crowd
around
her
to
hear
her
jesus
talk
she
told
them
of
jesus
love
for
them
she
told
them
how
he
had
died
that
they
might
be
saved
from
everlasting
death
and
be
made
pure
mary
had
her
hardships
often
she
would
not
be
able
to
get
home
at
night
and
would
have
to
sleep
in
the
open
it
was
not
easy
to
be
a
missionary
but
mary
was
gladly
willing
to
do
it
because
she
was
working
for
jesus
and
saving
souls
one
day
a
man
came
to
the
mission
house
i
am
the
servant
of
king
okon
king
okon
has
heard
of
the
white
ma
king
okon
has
heard
how
the
white
ma
loves
our
people
and
is
kind
to
them
king
okon
invites
the
white
ma
to
come
and
visit
our
country
i
shall
be
glad
to
come
if
i
may
tell
your
people
about
jesus
the
saviour
said
mary
sure
said
the
messenger
you
come
and
make
when
king
eyo
honesty
vii
mary
old
friend
heard
of
this
invitation
he
said
our
ma
must
not
go
as
an
ordinary
traveler
to
this
savage
land
and
people
she
must
go
as
a
lady
and
our
mother
one
whom
we
greatly
respect
and
love
he
brought
his
own
canoe
to
mary
and
said
the
canoe
is
yours
to
use
as
long
as
you
wish
mary
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
thankfulness
king
eyo
she
said
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
accept
the
offer
of
your
canoe
in
jesus
name
i
know
god
will
bless
you
for
your
kindness
god
has
blessed
me
said
the
king
he
has
sent
our
white
ma
to
us
the
canoe
was
long
and
slim
it
was
painted
in
bright
colors
at
the
front
end
flags
were
flying
in
the
middle
of
the
canoe
was
a
sort
of
tent
to
protect
mary
from
the
sun
the
christian
natives
had
brought
gifts
of
rice
and
these
were
put
in
the
boat
crowds
of
people
came
to
say
to
the
white
ma
at
last
it
began
to
get
dark
the
natives
who
were
going
to
row
climbed
into
the
boat
torches
were
lit
and
the
boat
started
upstream
as
mary
lay
down
in
her
tent
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
she
heard
the
rowers
singing
as
they
rowed
ma
our
beautiful
beloved
mother
is
on
board
they
sang
ho
ho
ho
she
thanked
god
that
he
had
protected
her
in
old
town
she
prayed
that
he
would
protect
her
still
as
she
went
into
a
part
of
the
country
where
no
one
had
yet
brought
the
news
about
a
loving
saviour
she
prayed
that
he
would
bless
her
speaking
so
that
many
people
would
believe
in
the
lord
jesus
and
be
saved
forever
as
she
prayed
the
rowers
continued
singing
their
song
ma
our
beautiful
beloved
mother
is
on
board
ho
ho
ho
mary
fell
asleep
and
the
canoe
carried
her
silently
through
the
night
to
a
new
part
of
the
country
and
to
new
adventures
when
the
sun
arose
the
following
morning
the
canoe
carrying
mary
slessor
arrived
at
king
okon
village
a
great
shout
went
up
from
the
people
when
they
heard
the
white
ma
had
come
you
have
my
room
said
the
chief
it
is
the
best
room
in
the
village
it
may
have
been
the
best
room
but
it
was
not
a
very
comfortable
one
rats
and
big
lizards
were
running
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
there
were
insects
and
fleas
and
lice
everywhere
the
people
were
much
interested
in
the
white
ma
they
had
never
seen
a
white
woman
before
they
crowded
into
the
yard
many
of
them
touched
and
pinched
mary
to
see
if
she
were
real
some
were
afraid
their
friends
laughed
at
them
and
pulled
them
into
the
yard
they
watched
mary
eat
they
watched
everything
she
did
mary
did
not
care
she
used
their
interest
in
her
to
tell
them
about
jesus
who
loved
them
she
told
them
that
they
must
love
jesus
and
trust
in
him
for
salvation
twice
a
day
she
held
services
and
great
crowds
came
to
hear
her
she
cut
out
clothes
for
the
people
and
taught
the
women
how
to
sew
she
gave
medicine
to
the
sick
and
bandaged
the
wounds
of
those
who
got
hurt
king
okon
said
mary
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
people
homes
in
the
jungle
may
i
go
no
white
ma
i
can
not
let
you
go
this
is
elephant
country
the
elephants
go
wild
and
run
over
everything
in
the
jungle
these
stampedes
have
been
so
bad
my
people
have
had
to
leave
off
farming
and
make
their
living
by
fishing
i
can
not
let
you
go
you
might
get
hurt
or
killed
one
night
mary
saw
that
the
people
looked
very
angry
some
were
sad
what
is
the
matter
asked
mary
two
of
the
king
young
wives
have
done
wrong
they
have
broken
a
law
answered
one
of
the
natives
they
thought
nobody
was
looking
and
went
into
a
room
where
a
young
man
was
sleeping
each
of
them
will
be
hit
a
hundred
times
with
a
whip
mary
went
to
the
king
she
asked
him
to
be
kinder
to
these
girls
she
begged
him
not
to
beat
them
so
much
ma
you
are
right
said
the
king
i
will
call
palaver
of
all
the
chiefs
if
you
say
we
must
not
whip
girl
we
must
listen
to
you
as
our
guest
and
ma
but
the
people
will
say
god
word
be
no
good
if
it
keeps
the
law
from
punishing
those
who
do
wrong
mary
saw
the
king
was
right
she
turned
to
the
of
the
king
you
have
brought
shame
to
the
king
and
the
tribe
by
the
silly
foolish
things
you
did
god
word
teaches
men
to
be
kind
and
merciful
and
generous
but
it
does
not
pass
over
sin
or
permit
it
i
can
not
ask
the
king
not
to
punish
you
ask
god
to
help
you
in
the
future
so
that
you
will
not
do
bad
or
foolish
things
all
the
chief
men
of
the
tribe
grunted
their
approval
of
what
mary
had
said
to
the
girls
but
then
mary
turned
to
the
chief
men
and
said
you
are
to
blame
your
custom
of
one
man
marrying
many
wives
is
wrong
and
cruel
these
girls
are
only
sixteen
years
old
and
still
love
fun
and
play
they
are
too
young
to
be
married
they
meant
no
real
harm
the
men
did
not
like
to
hear
that
they
did
not
like
to
hear
that
their
ways
were
wrong
if
punishment
is
hard
said
the
old
men
wife
and
slave
will
be
afraid
to
disobey
king
okon
said
mary
show
that
you
are
a
good
king
by
being
kind
and
merciful
do
be
too
hard
on
these
young
girls
all
right
ma
said
the
king
i
will
make
it
only
ten
blows
with
the
whip
also
we
will
not
rub
salt
into
the
wounds
to
make
them
sting
when
the
whipping
was
over
mary
took
the
girls
into
her
room
there
she
put
healing
medicine
on
their
backs
while
she
told
them
about
jesus
who
could
heal
their
souls
at
last
it
was
time
for
mary
to
go
back
to
old
town
the
king
and
the
people
were
sorry
to
see
her
go
on
her
homeward
way
a
tropical
storm
struck
the
canoe
and
the
people
in
it
mary
was
soaked
the
next
morning
she
was
shaking
with
sickness
and
fever
the
rowers
feared
their
white
ma
would
die
they
rowed
as
fast
as
they
could
for
old
town
mary
was
so
sick
that
she
had
to
take
a
long
rest
a
few
months
later
a
big
storm
tore
off
the
roof
of
her
house
and
again
she
was
soaked
as
she
worked
to
save
the
children
again
she
became
very
sick
you
must
go
home
to
scotland
said
daddy
anderson
you
must
go
home
and
rest
and
get
well
since
you
tell
me
to
do
that
and
the
board
has
ordered
it
too
i
can
only
obey
said
mary
i
am
going
to
take
my
little
black
janie
with
me
it
is
too
dangerous
to
leave
her
here
where
some
of
the
heathen
might
steal
her
and
kill
her
because
she
is
a
twin
with
a
heart
that
was
sad
at
leaving
calabar
but
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
see

mary
sailed
for
dundee
in
april
the
oh

is
good
to

said
mother
slessor
when
mary
arrived
once
more
in
scotland
and
this
is
little
janie
about
whom
you
have
written
us
so
often
we
are
happy
to
have
you
with
us
janie
i
am
glad
to
be
home
mother
said
mary
but
i
am
anxious
to
go
back
to
africa
as
soon
as
i
can
there
are
so
many
souls
there
to
be
won
for
jesus
mary
soon
got
over
her
sickness
and
was
well
and
strong
again
now
she
went
to
the
churches
in
scotland
to
tell
about
the
missionary
work
in
calabar
she
made
many
friends
some
of
the
young
people
who
heard
her
wanted
to
become
missionaries
miss
hoag
miss
wright
and
miss
peabody
decided
to
become
missionaries
and
later
worked
in
calabar
too
mary
was
so
successful
in
interesting
the
people
in
mission
work
that
the
board
of
missions
asked
her
to
stay
longer
and
visit
more
churches
mary
did
what
the
board
asked
although
she
was
anxious
to
get
back
to
africa
at
last
this
work
was
finished
now
she
could
go
back
mary
was
getting
ready
to
go
back
to
africa
when
her
sister
janie
became
sick
you
will
have
to
take
her
to
a
warmer
climate
said
the
doctor
that
is
the
only
way
she
will
get
well
mary
could
not
afford
to
take
her
sister
to
italy
or
southern
france
i
will
ask
the
board
of
missions
if
i
can
take
my
sister
with
me
to
africa
anxiously
mary
waited
for
an
answer
to
her
letter
at
last
the
letter
came
we
are
sorry
but
we
must
answer
your
question
with
a
no
we
feel
that
to
take
your
sick
sister
along
to
africa
would
be
an
unwise
mixing
of
family
problems
and
missionary
work
what
should
mary
do
now
a
friend
told
her
to
take
her
sister
to
southern
england
where
the
climate
was
warmer
than
in
scotland
she
wrote
to
the
board
to
ask
whether
they
would
let
her
be
a
missionary
if
she
took
out
the
time
to
take
care
of
her
sister
the
board
of
missions
wrote
dear
miss
slessor
when
the
way
is
clear
for
you
to
return
to
calabar
we
will
be
glad
to
send
you
out
again
as
our
missionary
in
the
meantime
we
will
be
glad
to
pay
your
missionary
salary
for
three
more
months
mary
was
glad
that
she
could
go
back
again
but
she
would
not
take
the
missionary
salary
when
she
was
not
working
as
a
missionary
this
left
her
with
a
sick
sister
and
no
salary
she
took
her
sister
janie
and
her
mother
to
southern
england
they
had
been
there
only
a
short
time
when
sister
susan
in
scotland
died
it
made
her
sad
to
lose
a
sister
but
she
was
happy
in
the
thought
that
susan
was
now
with
jesus
her
saviour
in
heaven
after
a
while
janie
was
better
and
mary
packed
up
and
got
ready
to
sail
once
more
to
africa
just
as
she
got
ready
to
go
her
mother
became
sick
what
should
mary
do
now
she
took
her
troubles
to
god
in
prayer
as
she
prayed
a
thought
came
to
her
which
showed
her
a
way
out
of
her
problem
i
will
send
for
my
old
friend
in
dundee
to
come
and
take
care
of
mother
and
then
i
can
go
to
africa
mother
slessor
agreed
that
this
was
the
thing
to
do
soon
the
friend
came
and
now
mary
was
free
to
go
to
africa
the
weeks
at
sea
were
a
good
rest
for
her
and
she
was
in
the
best
of
health
when
she
landed
once
more
at
duke
town
ten
years
had
gone
by
since
she
first
came
to
africa
where
should
i
go
now
asked
mary
of
daddy
anderson
after
she
was
once
again
in
the
mission
house
on
mission
hill
this
time
you
are
being
sent
up
to
creek
town
said
daddy
anderson
oh
i
glad
said
mary
that
is
the
settlement
farthest
up
the
river
you
will
work
with
the
rev
and
goldie
continued
daddy
anderson
that
makes
me
happy
too
they
are
old
friends
i
met
them
on
the
trip
the
time
before
this
one
as
soon
as
she
was
settled
in
creek
town
mary
worked
harder
than
ever
for
the
salvation
of
the
natives
she
did
not
care
about
her
health
the
only
thing
she
could
think
of
was
how
she
could
win
more
of
the
natives
to
christ
she
spent
very
little
on
herself
because
the
money
from
her
salary
was
needed
back
home
in
scotland
one
day
very
sad
news
came
from
scotland
mother
slessor
had
died
mary
was
very
sad
her
mother
was
the
one
who
had
interested
her
in
missionary
work
by
telling
her
stories
about
it
when
she
was
only
a
little
girl
her
mother
had
always
encouraged
her
in
her
work
her
mother
was
willing
to
do
anything
and
suffer
anything
so
that
mary
could
be
in
the
work
of
saving
souls
her
mother
was
always
interested
in
everything
that
mary
did
no
wonder
mary
was
sad
even
though
she
knew
that
her
mother
was
now
with
the
saviour
in
heaven
there
is
no
one
to
write
and
tell
my
stories
and
troubles
and
nonsense
to
all
my
life
i
have
been
caring
and
planning
and
living
for
my
mother
and
sisters
i
am
now
left
stranded
and
alone
but
she
was
not
alone
the
words
of
jesus
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
came
as
sweet
comfort
to
her
heart
heaven
is
now
nearer
to
me
than
scotland
she
said
and
no
one
will
be
worried
about
me
if
i
go
up
country
into
the
jungles
mary
was
very
anxious
to
go
to
the
deep
jungles
to
okoyong
but
every
time
she
mentioned
it
the
board
and
the
andersons
said
no
not
yet
the
tribes
were
cruel
and
wicked
they
were
always
fighting
among
themselves
and
with
other
tribes
they
did
more
bad
and
nasty
things
than
any
of
the
tribes
she
had
ever
worked
with
they
killed
twin
babies
they
stole
slaves
and
when
they
caught
some
stranger
they
made
him
a
slave
they
would
hide
along
jungle
paths
and
when
someone
went
by
they
would
kill
him
they
hated
the
people
of
calabar
and
the
british
government
at
different
times
missionaries
had
tried
to
get
into
this
land
but
always
they
had
to
run
for
their
lives
the
natives
of
okoyong
trusted
no
one
it
was
to
that
country
that
mary
wanted
to
carry
the
love
of
jesus
and
the
story
that
he
died
for
them
every
day
she
would
pray
lord
if
this
is
your
time
let
me
go
meanwhile
mary
worked
hard
at
creek
town
besides
her
missionary
work
she
was
taking
care
of
a
number
of
native
children
some
were
twins
she
had
saved
from
death
some
were
the
children
of
slaves
mary
took
care
of
these
children
at
her
own
expense
in
order
to
take
care
of
them
and
have
enough
food
for
them
she
ate
only
the
simplest
of
foods
sometimes
nothing
but
rice
for
a
long
time
one
day
a
man
came
to
creek
town
to
see
mary
i
am
the
father
of
janie
the
twin
he
said
i
am
glad
you
have
taken
care
of
her
come
and
see
her
said
mary
no
no
said
the
man
the
evil
spirit
will
put
a
spell
on
me
you
wo
be
hurt
if
you
stand
far
away
and
look
at
her
said
mary
as
he
watched
janie
mary
took
him
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
to
the
little
girl
she
put
his
strong
black
arms
around
her
little
shoulders
at
last
the
man
took
the
little
girl
on
his
lap
and
played
and
talked
with
her
after
this
he
came
often
to
visit
his
little
girl
and
brought
her
food
and
presents
at
last
the
time
came
when
word
reached
calabar
that
the
mission
board
had
decided
that
the
gospel
should
be
preached
in
okoyong
and
that
mary
could
go
mary
was
very
happy
at
last
god
had
answered
her
prayer
she
was
going
into
a
wild
country
she
was
going
to
go
ahead
of
the
other
missionaries
to
find
a
place
where
they
could
build
a
mission
house
and
church
when
king
eyo
honesty
vii
heard
of
it
he
came
to
see
mary
so
you
are
going
into
the
wild
country
to
okoyong
he
said
yes
and
i
am
so
happy
those
people
need
to
have
their
hearts
and
lives
changed
i
am
happy
that
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
them
about
the
saviour
are
you
afraid
to
go
among
these
wicked
men
what
if
they
should
go
on
the
warpath
when
you
arrive
i
am
not
worried
god
is
on
my
side
if
it
is
his
will
he
can
keep
me
from
all
harm
if
it
is
his
will
that
i
should
die
then
his
will
be
done
if
giving
my
life
will
help
open
okoyong
to
the
gospel
i
will
gladly
give
it
god
bless
you
ma
i
am
going
to
let
you
use
the
king
canoe
for
this
trip
my
rowers

take
you
there
swiftly
they
will
do
anything
you

because
they
love
you
thank
you
king
eyo
that
will
help
me
very
much
king
eyo
fixed
up
his
canoe
for
mary
as
though
she
were
a
queen
he
put
a
carpet
in
it
and
many
cushions
he
put
a
sort
of
tent
on
it
so
that
mary
could
be
alone
when
she
wanted
to
be
the
boat
was
loaded
with
homemade
bread
canned
meat
rice
and
tea
at
last
everything
was
ready
for
the
trip
into
the
wild
country
mary
said
to
her
friends
the
missionaries
and
to
her
native
friends
then
the
rowers
pushed
out
from
the
shore
and
headed
upstream
toward
the
wild
country
on
both
sides
of
the
river
were
banana
and
palm
trees
there
were
beautiful
plants
and
flowers
of
many
colors
the
light
shimmered
on
the
flowing
river
as
the
rowers
pulled
the
oars
and
sang
their
songs
what
will
happen
if
the
okoyongs
are
on
the
warpath
mary
asked
herself
what
will
i
do
then
mary
knew
the
answer
i
will
put
my
trust
in
god
and
not
in
man
she
lay
back
on
the
cushions
and
prayed
to
god
to
protect
her
in
the
wild
country
and
to
lead
her
in
his
way
the
rowers
rowed
swiftly
and
sent
the
canoe
shooting
up
the
river
toward
the
wild
country
there
is
the
landing
place
said
the
chief
rower
now

began
to

through
the
jungle

was
four
miles
to
ekenge
where

the

whispered

and
sober
mary

thanked
god
that
the
okoyongs
were
not
on
the
warpath
and
she
asked
god
blessing
on
her
visit
with

that
they
might
be

their
village
by
changing
their
lives
when
they
came
to
him
that
night
mary
did
not

very
much
the
chief
had
given
her
one
of
the
best
houses
in
the
village
but
we
would
not
think
it
was
much
of
a
house
her
bed
was
made
of
a
few
sticks
with
some
corn
shucks
thrown
over
them
in
the
room
all
night
were
plenty
of
rats
and
insects

was
happy

very
much
he
and
chief

agreed
to
let
her
start
a
mission
in
their
villages
each
one
promised
to
give
her
ground

a
mission
house
mary

with
us
as
they
rode
down
the
river
mary
could
not
sleep
at
first
because
the
rowers
kept
whispering
do

the
canoe
or
you

ma
or

so
loud
so
ma
can

and
ifako
she
fell

of
the
traders

ekenge
do
you
trust
those
wild
people
he
asked
do
you
think
you
can
change
them
what
they
need
more
than
a
missionary
is
a
to
tame
them
down
no
my
friend
answered
mary
they
need
the
same
thing
that
every
person
in
the
world
needs
and
that
is
the
saviour
jesus
christ
only
jesus
can
change
the
hearts
of
sinful
people

they
told
her

said
one
of
the
young
men
she

decided
she
should
go
and
help
she
took
off
her
muddy
shoes
and
started
back
through
the
dark
and
fearful
jungle
mary
was
afraid
when
she
heard
the
snarls
of
animals
in
the
jungle
but
she
put
her
trust
in
god
and
went
on
as
mary
came
near
to
the
beach
she
met
john
ma
mary
he
said
the
men
will
not
come
they
will
not
bring
the
things
until
the
daylight
chases
away
the
hidden
dangers
of
the
jungle
i
will
talk
to
them
said
mary
she
plodded
on
through
the
mud
she
came
to
the
canoe
the
men
were
all
sound
asleep
mary
woke
them
and
put
them
to
work
in
the
meantime
bishop
had
coaxed
some
of
the
slaves
from

church
time

where

the
people
mary
and
bishop
and
the
children
began
to
sing
hymns
as
loud
as
they
could
still
no
one
came
how
discouraging
all
the
people
had
been
at
the
burying
when
they
buried
somebody
especially
somebody
important
like
the
chief
mother
they
would
have
a
wild
party
the
people
would
get
drunk
and
do
many
other
wicked
things
the
next
day
they
would
be
too
tired
and
sick
to
do
anything
mary
and
the
children
and
bishop
kept
on
singing
at
last
a
few
women
came
mary
gathered
them
around
her
and
told
them
the
story
of
jesus
and
his
love
the
women
listened
but
they
did
not
say
anything
after
the
service
was
over
and
the
women
had
gone
to
their
huts
mary
knelt
down
and
prayed
o
god
my
heavenly
father
with
your
help
i
have
made
a
beginning
in
the
jungles
of
okoyong
things
look
black
and
discouraging
now
but
i
know
that
if
it
is
your
will
you
can
change
all
that
if
it
is
not
your
will
that
my
work
is
successful
here
then

me
wherever
i
can
work
best
for
you

and

to
her
chief

to
war
against
the
tribe
of
chief
okurike
because
she
was

she
said
to

they
started
on
the
journey
it
was
raining
hard
after
they
had
left
ekenge
it
began
to
pour
the
jungle
was
flooded
and
steaming
hot
it
was
hard
to
go
but
mary
and
the
guard
pushed
on
soon
mary
clothes
were
soaked
through
they
became
so
heavy
she
could
hardly
walk
her
boots
became
water
soaked
she
took
them
off
and
threw
them
in
the
bush
soon
her
stockings
wore
out
and
she
walked
through
the
jungle
mud
barefooted
she
knew
she
was
doing
god
work
and
even
fearful
rainstorms
were
not
going
to
stop
her
after
three
hours
the
weather
began
to
clear
but
now
mary
head
began
to
ache
from
fever
as
mary
and
the
guard
passed
through
the
jungle
villages
the
people
looked
at
mary
with
surprise
but
nothing
would
stop
mary
she
pushed
on
and
after
walking
through
the
jungle
for
eight
hours
she
stumbled
into
the
village
of
the
sick
chief
some
of
the
people
were
crying
they
expected
to
be
killed
when
the
chief
died
others
were
laughing
and
shouting
they
were
going
to
have
fun
when
the
chief
died
they
were
going
to
kill
people
and
have
a
wild
party
mary
was
tired
and
sick
but
she
went
at
once
to
the
chief
house
he
was
stretched
out
on
a
dirty
bed
his
face
was
gray
with
sickness
he
was
moaning
and
groaning
he
was
very
near
death
mary
examined
the
chief
to
see
what
his
sickness
was
she
opened
her
little
medicine
chest
and
took
out
some
medicine
she
gave
the
chief
a
dose
it
made
the
chief
a
little
better
i
do
have
enough
of
this
medicine
with
me
said
mary
she
knew
that
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
another
missionary
was
working
she
knew
he
had
some
of
the
medicine
she
went
to
the
men
of
the
village
you
must
go
across
the
river
to
ikorofiong
for
more
medicine
said
mary
no
no
we
can
not
go
said
the
men
of
the
village
our
enemies
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
they
will
kill
us
if
we
go
there
but
i
must
have
the
medicine
said
mary
there
is
a
man
from
that
village
down
the
river
a
little
ways
he
is
living
in
his
canoe
on
the
river
maybe
he
will
go
said
one
of
the
men
some
of
the
men
ran
down
to
the
river
they
found
the
man
they
promised
him
many
things
at
last
he
said
he
would
go
the
next
day
he
brought
the
medicine
to
mary
for
days
mary
nursed
chief
okurike
she
taught
one
of
his
wives
how
to
help
her
she
also
told
the
chief
and
his
family
about
jesus
whenever
she
could
leave
the
chief
for
a
short
time
she
would
talk
to
the
tribe
about
the
saviour
and
how
he
would
change
their
lives
if
they
believed
in
him
day
after
day
mary
prayed
for
chief
okurike
at
last
prayer
won
out
chief
okurike
got
well
the
people
were
very
happy
ma
mary
they
said
we
want
to
learn
book
they
meant
that
they
wanted
to
learn
about
the
bible
i
am
glad
you
do
said
mary
but
then
you
must
do
what
the
book
says
we
will
said
the
people
we
will
make
peace
with
calabar
we
will
not
kill
the
traders
who
come
to
our
land
or
the
other
white
people
then
i
will
always
be
your
worker
and
i
will
send
you
a
teacher
as
soon
as
i
can
who
will
teach
you
of
the
saviour
who
died
for
you
to
pay
for
your
sins
mary
went
back
to
ekenge
here
she
found
that
chief
edem
was
very
sick
he
had
some
very
bad
boils
on
his
back
mary
put
medicine
on
the
boils
every
day
she
came
to
his
house
and
took
care
of
him
one
day
when
she
came
in
she
saw
feathers
and
eggs
lying
around
the
room
this
was
witch
doctor
medicine
on
the
chief
neck
and
around
his
arms
and
legs
were
witch
charms
oh
chief
edem
said
mary
how
could
you
do
this
surely
you
know
that
doing
witchcraft
is
a
sin
against
god
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
go
back
to
it
after
you
had
learned
to
know
about
jesus
ma
you
do
know
all
about
these
things
someone
is
the
cause
of
this
sickness
you
do
know
all
the
badness
of
the
black
man
heart
look
here
are
the
proofs
that
someone
is
working
witchcraft
against
me
the
only
one
who
can
fight
that
is
the
witch
doctor
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
make
me
well
see
here
are
the
things
that
were
taken
from
my
back
chief
edem
pointed
to
a
collection
of
shot
egg
shells
seed
and
other
things
which
the
witch
doctor
said
had
come
from
his
back
he
believed
the
witch
doctor
he
believed
that
someone
using
witchcraft
had
sent
them
into
his
back
mary
knew
what
would
happen
everybody
whom
the
chief
thought
might
have
done
the
witchcraft
would
have
to
take
poison
the
people
thought
that
if
the
person
who
took
the
poison
died
he
was
guilty
but
if
he
was
not
guilty
he
would
live
the
tribe
would
also
use
other
tortures
like
pouring
boiling
oil
on
people
to
get
them
to
confess
that
is
all
wrong
said
mary
the
sickness
is
because
you
have
not
eaten
good
things
or
taken
care
of
yourself
and
kept
as
clean
as
you
should
have
do
believe
the
bad
witch
doctor
god
said
something
about
that
in
exodus
chief
edem
would
not
listen
he
had
everyone
he
thought
might
have
the
witchcraft
made
a
prisoner
the
witch
doctor
took
the
chief
and
his
wives
and
chief
men
and
prisoners
to
a
nearby
farm
mary
was
not
allowed
to
come
to
this
farm
mary
knew
of
someone
who
could
help
her
she
prayed
to
god
again
and
again
to
keep
these
people
from
doing
the
bad
things
they
planned
days
went
by
mary
prayed
that
chief
edem
might
get
well
god
heard
prayers
he
did
what
she
asked
he
made
chief
edem
well
again
when
chief
edem
was
well
again
he
decided
not
to
kill
the
prisoners
the
people
he
thought
might
have
done
witchcraft
against
him
he
let
them
go
free
then
the
chief
and
his
wives
and
the
chief
men
came
back
to
the
village
the
tribe
had
a
big
party
to
celebrate
they
were
happy
the
chief
was
well
it
was
the
wildest
party
mary
had
ever
seen
the
people
stuffed
themselves
with
food
until
they
became
sick
they
got
drunk
they
had
wild
dances
they
did
many
wicked
things
mary
had
often
prayed
that
god
would
turn
the
heathen
people
from
their
wicked
ways
but
here
they
were
carrying
on
worse
than
ever
the
only
answer
to
her
prayers
that
she
could
see
was
that
the
prisoners
who
were
going
to
be
killed
had
been
set
free

i
doing
anything
for
my
saviour
mary
asked

one
day
chief
njiri
and
his
warriors
came
to
visit
chief
edem
they
stayed
several
days
they
had
wild
parties
every
day
they
drank
native
beer
until
they
became
drunk
then
they
would
quarrel
and
fight
they
asked
mary
to
settle
their
quarrels
and
decide
who
was
right
mary
was
praying
every
day
that
there
would
not
be
bad
fights
and
that
no
one
would
be
killed
finally
it
was
the
last
night
of
the
visit
the
men
were
so
drunk
that
mary
knew
there
would
be
trouble
when
the
chief
and
his
men
were
ready
to
leave
everyone
was
excited
the
people
were
shouting
and
pushing
some
shots
were
fired
and
the
men
began
stabbing
with
their
swords
they
were
too
drunk
to
know
what
they
were
doing
mary
ran
into
the
crowd
she
went
up
to
chief
njiri
chief
said
mary

she
took
hold
of
the
chief
arm
and

the
village
and
his
men
followed
him
they
started
for
their
own
village
i
glad

mary
but
she
had
spoken
too
soon
on
their
way

as
they
were
staggering

the
men
mary

been
following
the

to
make
sure
they
would
go
home
she
heard
the
shouting
now
the
men
started
running
past
her
she
tried
to
stop
them
but
they
slipped
away
mary
took
a
short
cut
through
the
jungle
she
reached
the
road
to
the
village
before
the
men
did
god
our
father
in

prayed
mary

she
cried

the
men
stopped
the
others
soon
came
running
up
they
had
to
stop
too
you
men
are
planning
to
do
something
bad
you
do
not
know
that
the
people
of
this
village
did
bad
things
to
you
you
only
think
they
did
you
have
drunk
too
much
beer
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
doing

but
ma
said
njiri
they

are
hurt
njiri
and
his
men
argued
with
mary
but
finally
they
listened
to
her
they
turned
around
and
once
more
started
for
home
mary
went
with
them
to
make
sure
they
would
get
there
at
last
they
came
again
to
the
banana
plant
and
the
witch
medicine
they
were
afraid
to
pass
it
if
we
pass
it
we
will
get
sick
and
die
said
njiri
that
is
sinful
foolishness
said
mary
that
banana
plant
and
those
other
things
will
not
hurt
you
i
am
not
afraid
of
them
mary
picked
up
the
banana
plant
the
palm
leaves
nuts
and
coconut
shell
and
threw
them
into
the
jungle
now
brave
men
come
on
i
have
cleared
the
path
let
us
go
to
your
village
timidly
the
men
tiptoed
past
the
place
where
the
medicine
had
been
then
they
went
on
to
their
own
village
once
more
mary
thought
that
all
would
be
peaceful
now
for
a
while
she
started
for
the
village
of
ekenge
no
sooner
was
mary
gone
than
the
people
of
njiri
began
drinking
again
then
they
started
quarreling
and
fighting
one
of
the
men
in
the
village
ran
and
told
mary
i
will
fix
that
said
mary
she
took
some
of
the
men
of
ekenge
with
her
she
went
to
the
village
of
njiri
with
the
help
of
the
men
of
ekenge
and
some
of
the
people
of
the
village
they
tied
some
of
the
most
drunken
men
and
the
wildest
fighters
to
the
trees
they
left
them
there
to
cool
themselves
in
the
breezes
of
the
jungle
after
several
hours
mary
untied
them
because
she
was
afraid
that
some
lions
might
come
and
kill
and
eat
them
now
that
things
were
quiet
mary
again
started
for
home
on
the
way
she
picked
up
the
little
banana
plant
that
had
caused
so
much
trouble
and
took
it
with
her
i
will
plant
it
in
my
own
yard
and
see
what
witchcraft
can
do
said
mary
early
the
next
morning
a
man
from
njiri
village
came
running
into
ekenge
he
went
to
mary
house
ma
said
the
runner
chief
njiri
was
very
sick
last
night
he
suffered
very
much
the
witch
doctor
took
sticks
and
shells
and
shot
from
his
leg
it
is
because
he
walked
past
the
banana
plant
and
other
magic
medicine
give
me
the
little
banana
plant
for
the
chief
no
i
can
not
do
that
said
mary
she
knew
that
if
the
banana
plant
was
taken
to
the
chief
someone
would
die
because
of
the
witchcraft
belief
but
you
must
send
it
said
chief
edem
if
you
do
not
send
it
he
will
make
war
on
us
very
well
said
mary
i
will
send
it
but
i
know
there
will
be
much
trouble
so
he
took
the
banana
plant
to
chief
njiri
when
he
received
it
he
and
his
warriors
went
to
the
village
which
he
thought

working
witchcraft
against
him
he
made
all
the
people
of
the
village
come
to

one
of

that

the
villages
mary
had
a
true
friend
in
ma
eme
the
sister
of
chief
edem
she
helped
mary
often
she
did
everything
she
could
to
help
mary
and
the
mission
but
one
thing
she
never
did
that
was
to
confess
christ
openly
she
and
mary
talked
of
many
things
as
they
worked
together
one
day
ma
eme
said
when
my
husband
died
i
had
to
go
through
the
chicken
test
what
is
that
asked
mary
all
of
my
husband
wives
i
too
were
put
on
trial
the
witch
doctors
were
trying
to
find
who
caused
my
husband
a
great
chief
to
die
each
of
us
had
to
bring
a
chicken
the
witch
doctor
chopped
off
the
heads
of
the
chickens
one
at
a
time
if
the
headless
chicken
fluttered
one
way
the
witch
doctor
said
the
wife
was
innocent
if
it
fluttered
the
other
way
he
said
she
was
guilty
what
happened
when
they
cut
off
the
head
of
your
chicken
asked
mary
it
fluttered
wildly
in
the
right
direction
the
witch
doctor
said
i
was
innocent
but
the
strain
had
been
so
great
i
fainted
and
had
to
be
carried
to
my
hut
but
many
of
the
other
wives
were
killed
you
do
not
believe
in
the
witch
doctors
do
you
asked
mary
ma
eme
looked
all
around
then
she
stepped
close
to
mary
and
whispered
no
but
i
would
not
tell
anyone
else
they
are
too
strong
and
tricky
they
could
cause
me
much
trouble
if
they
knew
i
was
against
them
i
shall
fight
the
witch
doctors
as
long
as
god
gives
me
strength
god
is
against
the
witch
doctors
who
do
such
evil
things
chief
edem
had
promised
mary
a
house
and
the
people
of
the
village
had
said
they
would
build
it
but
whenever
mary
wanted
to
start
they
would
say
tomorrow
we
will
start
ma
but
tomorrow
just
did
not
come
at
last
mary
and
the
children
she
had
adopted
and
the
native
children
cleared
the
ground
they
stuck
sticks
in
the
ground
for
the
wall
they
began
to
make
the
roof
then
some
of
the
lazy
people
of
the
village
began
to
help
and
at
last
the
house
was
built
mary
also
wanted
to
build
a
church
and
school
at
ifako
the
chief
there
had
promised
to
help
but
the
people
of
that
village
were
lazy
too
they
were
always
putting
off
doing
the
building
one
morning
a
man
came
from
ifako
my
master
wants
you
he
said
mary
went
to
ifako
the
chiefs
were
together
at
a
cleared
piece
of
ground
see
ma
here
is
your
ground
here
are
the
sticks
and
mud
and
palm
leaves
and
other
things
we
need
to
build
shall
we
build
the
church
today
it
did
not
take
long
for
mary
to
say
yes
the
people
of
the
village
forgot
to
be
lazy
they
were
having
fun
building
the
church
when
it
was
finally
finished
it
was
feet
wide
by
thirty
feet
long
we
would
not
think
that
was
a
very
big
building
but
it
was
the
biggest
in
the
village
see
said
the
chief
of
ifako
it
is
much
better
than
the
house
at
ekenge
it
is
a
fine
church
said
mary
now
we
must
keep
it
clean
and
nice
there
should
be
no
dirty
things
in
or
around
god
house
we
would
not
think
it
was
such
a
fine
church
the
walls
were
made
of
dry
mud
and
sticks
the
roof
was
made
of
mats
the
floors
were
made
of
mud
and
so
were
the
seats
but
everything
was
polished
and
rubbed
as
smooth
as
possible
there
were
no
windows
or
doors
in
the
building
there
were
just
holes
in
the
wall
to
let
in
the
light
for
windows
and
a
larger
hole
to
serve
as
an
entrance
but
mary
thought
it
was
a
fine
church
because
it
was
the
best
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
because
it
was
a
place
where
people
could
hear
about
the
saviour
and
learn
book
we
will
hold
our
first
service
in
the
new
church
next
sunday
said
mary
i
want
you
all
to
come
we
will
come
ma
promised
the
natives
poison
tomorrow
we
will
have
our
first
service
in
our
new
church
you
must
dress
right
for
it
said
mary
she
took
out
of
her
mission
boxes
clothes
of
all
kinds
and
colors
which
the
people
in
the
homeland
had
sent
to
her
you
must
wear
these
to
church

indeed
a
happy
day
for

the
church
was
filled
with
people
many
of
them
came
just
out
of
curiosity
but
there
were
many
who
had
learned
to
know
and
love
and
trust
in
jesus
mary
now
started
day
classes
and
these
too
were
crowded
because
many
wanted
to
learn
book
they
wanted
to
learn
about
ma
god
and
about
the
saviour
who
took
away
sins
it
was
not
long
before
a
change
could
be
seen
in
many
of
these
people
they
had
become
christians
the
look
of
fear
was
gone
from
their
eyes
they
no
longer
feared
the
demons
because
they
had
a
saviour
who
loved
them
and
took
care
of
them
they
did
not
do
the
wicked
things
they
had
done
before
they
tried
to
live
as
god
wanted
them
to
live

the
like
to

answered
the
traders
we

native
guards
on
the
jungle
paths
will
kill
us
mary
wrote
to
good
king
eyo
of

told
them
of
the
good
things
they

by
trading
at
last
they
agreed
to
go
they
collected
two
canoeloads
of
bananas
barrels

jungle
crops
then
the
chiefs
and
warriors
came
marching
down
to
the

to
go
to
the

at

when
mary
said
this
many
of
the
natives
disappeared
into
the
jungle
they
would
not
go
without
their
weapons
ma
you
make
women
of
us
argued
those
who
remained
would
a
man
go
among
strangers
without
arms
you
may
not
take
arms
said
mary
you
are
not
going
to

friendly
visit
if

not
take
our
swords

i
promised
king
eyo
that
you
would
come

you
go

on
your
word
and
make
me
a
liar
for
two
hours
they
argued
with
mary
the
beach
filled
with
natives
from
the
village
who
wanted
to
see
the
chiefs
start
on
their
trip
the
chiefs
did
not
want
to
look
like
cowards
to
the
people
of
the
village
at
last
they
took
off
their
swords
and
gave
their
guns
to
their
white
ma
those
who
had
run
away
to
the
jungle
came
back
and
decided
to
go
along

said
the
chiefs
but
we
will
go
we
will
not
make
you
a
liar
ma
they
got
off
into
their
boats
as

of
the
boats

saw
the
gleam
of
flashing
swords

mary
the
rowers
stopped
mary
took
the
swords

threw
them
into
the
river

just
rowed
down
the
river
the
chiefs
who
went

a
wonderful
time
they
went
to
the
church
services
king
eyo
honesty
talked
with
them
about
the
gospel

meant
for
their
lives
he
took
them

mary
missionary

having
its
effect
on
the
lives

their
heathen
ways

they
were
rubbing

his

the
witch
doctor

he
did
all

of
queer
things
which
he
said

tell
him
who
had
made
the
young
man
die
he
pretended
to
be
listening
to
the
dead
boy
talk
it

the
people
of
payekong
they
are
to

my
warriors
and

payekong
said
chief
capture
the
people
and

quickly
now
the
warriors
were
too
late

akpo
the
chief
of
payekong
had
heard
the
news
he
and
his
people
had
run
off
into
the
jungle
only
a
few
people
were
left
in
the
village
those
were
captured
by
edem
soldiers
and
brought
to
ekenge
mary
was
sure
that
chief
edem
would
make
the
people
take
the
poison
bean
test
this
is
how
the
test
was
made
a
small
brown
bean
full
of
poison
was
crushed
and
put
into
water
the
person
who
was
tested
had
to
drink
the
poison
water
the
natives
thought
that
if
the
person
drank
the
water
and
died
he
was
guilty
if
he
lived
he
was
innocent
that
is
no
way
to
honor
your
son
chief
edem
said
mary
you
know
it
is
wrong
and
sinful
to
kill
people
but
they
are
bad
people
they
deserve
to
die
you
do
not
know
that
that
water
is
poison
anyone
who
drinks
it
would
die
oh
no
ma
if
the
one
who
drinks
it
is
innocent
he
will
live
i
do
not
agree
with
you
come
let
us
honor
your
son
in
a
better
way
mary
wrapped
the
young
man
body
in
silk
she
dressed
him
in
the
finest
suit
she
could
find
she
wrapped
a
silk
turban
around
his
head
and
then
placed
a
high
red
and
black
hat
with
bright
colored
feathers
on
his
head
no
chief
had
ever
been
dressed
so
fine
for
his
burial
the
body
was
carried
out
into
the
yard
and
seated
in
a
large
chair
under
an
umbrella
a
stick
and
a
whip
was
placed
in
his
hand
this
showed
he
was
a
chief
son
a
mirror
was
also
put
in
his
hand
so
he
could
see
how
wonderful
he
was
on
a
table
beside
him
were
placed
all
his
treasures
those
included
skulls
he
had
taken
in
war
then
the
people
were
let
into
the
yard
to
see
etim
the
people
shouted
they
were
so
happy
they
danced
around
they
called
for
whiskey
to
drink
chief
edem
gave
them
much
whiskey
to
drink
they
became
wilder
and
wilder
mary
and
mr
ovens
took
turns
watching
the
prisoners
they
were
afraid
the
people
would
kill
them
as
mary
was
going
to
her
house
for
a
little
rest
she
saw
some
poison
beans
on
the
pounding
stone
this
filled
her
with
fear
she
was
not
afraid
for
herself
but
for
the
poor
prisoners
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
prayed
dear
father
in
heaven
prayed
mary
watch
over
these
poor
people
do
not
let
harm
come
to
these
prisoners
keep
the
other
people
from
doing
murder
give
me
the
courage
to
face
the
chiefs
and
tell
them
they
are
wrong
in
all
these
things
may
thy
will
be
done
i
ask
this
in
name
after
she
had
prayed
mary
got
up
and
went
to
chief
edem
and
his
brother
ekponyong
you
must
forbid
the
poison
bean
test
said
mary
it
is
wrong
and
sinful
god
is
watching
what
you
do

do
that
sinful
thing
that
is
my
business
said
chief
edem
i
am
the
chief
of
this
tribe
i
will
do
what
seems
good
to
me
mary
argued
with
the
chief
but
he
would
not
listen
ekponyong
his
brother
encouraged
edem
to
make
the
prisoners
take
the
poison
bean
test
mary
then
went
to
the
yard
where
the
prisoners
were
kept
she
sat
down
in
the
gateway
she
was
not
going
to
let
anyone
get
the
prisoners
this
made
the
chiefs
very
angry
the
crowd
of
village
people
howled
and
yelled
chief
edem
warriors
shook
their
swords
and
guns
at
her
and
stamped
the
ground
angrily
raise
our
master
from
the
dead
shouted
the
people
and
we
will
free
the
prisoners
mary
kept
her
place
she
wrote
a
note
to
duke
town
asking
for
help
and
sent
it
off
secretly
by
one
of
her
orphan
boys
still
she
watched
over
the
prisoners
she
would
not
leave
her
place
in
the
gate
the
people
were
angry
with
her
but
still
many
of
them
loved
and
respected
their
white
ma
and
would
not
hurt
her
suddenly
a
man
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
he
shoved
mary
aside
he
grabbed
one
of
the
women
prisoners
he
dragged
her
in
front
of
the
body
of
etim
he
handed
her
the
cup
of
poison
drink
he
cried
drink
and
prove
that
you
are
innocent
or
drink
and
die
for
oh

do
not
leave
us

begged
the
other

as
the
poor

got
ready
to
drink
the
poison
lord

me
and

these
poor

the
cup
of
poison
to
her
lips
mary
grabbed
her
arm

she
whispered

and
the

into
the
jungle
they
went
to
the
mission

wrong
we

done
more
for
you
than
we
have
ever
done
before
we
will
do
nothing
else
said
chief
edem
he
turned
his
back
on
mary
and
walked
away
people
from
other
villages
came
to
take
part
in
the
wild
parties
that
were
always
held
when
there
was
a
funeral
mary
tried
again
and
again
to
get
edem
to
free
the
three
prisoners
mary
and
mr
ovens
managed
to
take
mojo
and
otinga
to
the
mission
house
where
they
were
safe
again
mary
pleaded
for
obwe
chief
edem
was
very
angry
will
you
not
have
me
honor
my
son
you
have
run
off
with
my
prisoners
i
will
burn
down
the
mission
house
i
will
send
you
back
to
duke
town
then
you
can
not
trouble
me
any
longer
brother
you
do
not
speak
wisely
said
ma
eme
sister
the
white
ma
has
done
many
good
things
for
us
if
we
burn
down
the
mission
house
you
will
have
a
bad
name
among
all
tribes
chain
obwe
in
the
white
ma
yard
so
that
the
village
people
can
not
harm
her
she
can
not
get
away
and
you
can
find
out
later
whether
she
is
guilty
or
not
very
well
said
chief
edem
i
will
do
that
but
the
three
must
be
killed
for
the
funeral
what
kind
of
a
funeral
will
that
be
for
a
chief
son
if
no
one
is
killed
he
will
have
no
one
to
go
with
him
on
the
way
to
the
dark
land
the
next
day
two
missionaries
came
from
duke
town
in
answer
to
note
it
was
a
great
honor
to
have
so
many
white
people
at
a
funeral
chief
edem
was
no
longer
as
angry
as
he
had
been
the
missionaries
showed
slide
pictures
the
natives
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
it
pleased
them
very
much
and
it
also
quieted
them
down
the
next
day
when
the
funeral
was
held
a
cow
was
killed
and
put
in
the
coffin
with
etim
instead
of
the
people
who
were
thought
to
have
worked
witchcraft
against
him
mary
was
glad
and
thankful
to
god
that
she
had
been
able
to
save
the
prisoners
the
last
of
the
prisoners
was
let
go
free
on
the
promise
that
if
chief
akpo
was
caught
he
would
take
the
poison
test
mary
heard
that
etim
was
the
only
chief
in
okoyong
ever
to
be
buried
without
some
people
being
killed
as
a
human
sacrifice
the
people
of
the
jungle
thought
mary
was
wonderful
indeed
mary
thought
that
this
trouble
was
over
but
a
short
time
later
uncle
who
lived
in
a
nearby
village
was
accused
of
having
killed
the
young
man
he
came
to
ekenge
and
met
with
the
village
chiefs
i
am
willing
to
take
the
poison
bean
test
said
the
uncle
if
all
of
the
chiefs
will
take
the
test
that
means
you
too
edem
those
who
are
innocent
will
not
be
hurt
i
will
take
the
test
but
all
the
other
chiefs
must
too
when
mary
heard
that
etim
uncle
was
going
to
take
the
poison
bean
test
if
the
other
chiefs
would
she
rushed
to
the
village
the
men
were
arguing
they
were
shaking
their
swords
and
guns
at
one
another
mary
looked
around
until
she
found
the
bag
of
poison
beans
she
took
them
and
ran
off
with
them
the
chiefs
could
not
find
the
poison
beans
finally
they
quieted
down
chief
edem
went
to
mary
give
me
the
poison
beans
he
said
i
know
you
have
taken
them
yes
i
took
them
said
mary
but
i
will
not
give
them
to
you
there
has
been
enough
trouble
and
sadness
and
fear
when
will
you
be
satisfied
that
your
son
death
was
an
accident
chief
edem
turned
around
and
went
back
to
the
village
he
sent
all
the
chiefs
home
nothing
more
was
said
about
the
poison
bean
test
now
mary
began
to
plead
for
akpo
the
chief
of
the
village
which
the
witch
doctor
had
said
had
caused
etim
to
be
killed
chief
edem
let
him
come
home
forgive
him
he
has
done
you
no
wrong
god
softened
edem
heathen
heart
after
several
weeks
he
agreed
to
let
akpo
come
home
you
may
tell
him
edem
said
to
mary
that
all
thought
of
revenge
is
gone
from
my
heart
if
he
wishes
to
return
to
his
own
village
he
may
do
so
or
he
may
go
anywhere
in
okoyong
in
safety
nothing
like
that
had
ever
been
done
before
in
the
jungle
the
heathen
people
did
not
forgive
they
always
took
revenge
akpo
did
not
believe
edem
had
forgiven
him
he
did
not
want
to
trust
edem
at
last
mary
convinced
him
that
edem
meant
just
what
he
said
and
that
akpo
could
really
go
home
mary
and
akpo
came
to
his
home
village
of
payekong
the
houses
had
been
burned
the
cattle
had
been
stolen
but
it
was
still
home
tears
came
to
akpo
eyes
thankfully
the
chief
kneeled
at
mary
feet
oh
ma
thank
you
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
and
my
people
i
and
my
people
will
always
do
whatever
you
ask
akpo
kept
his
promise
other
chiefs
often
argued
with
mary
and
threatened
to
hurt
her
but
akpo
and
his
people
always
helped
her
and
did
whatever
she
wanted
them
to
do
chief
edem
now
was
kind
to
akpo
and
his
people
he
built
houses
for
them
and
helped
them
get
their
gardens
started
again
he
gave
them
some
cattle
too
after
some
time
had
gone
by
chief
edem
came
to
mary
he
kneeled
down
before
her
thank
you
ma
for
being
brave
thank
you
for
keeping
after
me
until
i
let
those
prisoners
go
i
am
glad
that
people
were
not
killed
at
the
time
of
etim
death
your
ways
are
better
than
ours
we
are
tired
of
the
old
ways
many
other
people
came
and
told
her
how
glad
they
were
that
the
old
ways
were
changing
they
said
that
they
knew
the
old
ways
were
bad
mary
had
had
a
very
hard
time
in
the
jungles
but
now
things
were
going
better
she
was
busy
all
the
time
teaching
and
preaching
and
nursing
she
journeyed
through
the
jungle
where
the
wild
animals
were
but
she
did
not
fear
she
was
trusting
god
to
take
care
of
her
as
he
had
taken
care
of
daniel
in
the
lions
den
always
she
told
the
people
of
the
loving
saviour
who
had
died
for
their
sins
after
a
time
mary
fell
sick
she
caught
the
jungle
fever
she
became
very
weak
mary
said
ovens
you
must
take
a
vacation
you
must
get
away
from
the
jungle
for
a
while
you
must
go
to
england
for
a
long
rest
that
way
you
can
get
well
and
come
back
to
work
here
at
okoyong
you
are
right
said
mary
much
as
i
hate
to
leave
my
work
here
i
know
i
must
go
i
will
ask
for
a
furlough
at
once
for
three
years
mary
had
worked
in
okoyong
but
already
there
was
a
change
among
the
heathen
people
the
gospel
of
jesus
has
a
wonderful
power
to
change
hearts
and
lives
as
soon
as
word
came
that
another
worker
was
being
sent
to
take
her
place
mary
got
ready
to
leave
for
england
at
last
the
day
came
that
miss
dunlop
the
new
worker
arrived
mary
was
ready
to
leave
her
friends
carried
her
trunk
and
suitcases
down
to
the
ekenge
landing
a
great
crowd
had
come
to
the
landing
to
tell
her
and
wish
her
a
safe
journey
mary
was
telling
them
to
help
miss
dunlop
and
to
remain
true
to
the
bible
teaching
suddenly
a
man
was
seen
running
through
the
crowd
he
ran
up
to
mary
come
white
ma
a
young
man
has
been
shot
in
the
hand
and
he
wants
your
medicine
do
go
ma
said
ma
eme
mary
friend
you
are
tired
and
sick
you
must
get
back
to
england
if
you
go
with
this
man
you
may
miss
your
boat
let
someone
else
go
it
is
a
bad
tribe
they
are
always
fighting
it
is
dangerous
to
go
said
chief
edem
do
not
go
with
the
man
you
can
not
go
said
her
other
friends
at
ekenge
you
are
too
sick
to
walk
the
wild
animals
in
the
jungle
will
kill
you
the
wild
warriors
are
out
they
will
kill
you
in
the
dark
not
knowing
who
you
are
but
i
must
go
said
mary
if
you
must
go
said
chief
edem
then
you
must
take
two
armed
men
with
you
you
must
get
the
chief
of
the
next
village
to
send
his
drummer
with
you
when
the
people
hear
the
drum
they
will
know
that
a
protected
person
is
traveling
who
must
not
be
hurt
it
was
night
mary
slessor
and
the
two
men
marched
out
into
the
darkness
the
lanterns
threw
strange
shadows
that
looked
like
fierce
men
in
the
darkness
at
last
mary
and
her
guard
came
to
the
village
where
they
were
to
ask
for
the
drummer
they
told
the
chief
what
chief
edem
had
said
but
the
chief
did
not
want
to
help
them
you
are
going
to
a
fighting
tribe
said
the
chief
they
will
not
listen
to
what
a
woman
says
you
had
better
go
back
i
will
not
protect
you
you
do
think
a
woman
can
do
much
maybe
you
are
right
said
mary
to
the
chief
but
you
forget
what
the
woman
god
can
do
he
can
do
anything
i
shall
go
on
mary
went
on
into
the
darkness
the
natives
watched
her
go
she
must
be
crazy
they
thought
she
had
talked
back
to
their
chief
who
had
the
power
to
kill
her
she
had
walked
on
into
a
jungle
where
wild
leopards
were
ready
to
jump
on
her
she
was
going
where
men
were
drinking
and
making
themselves
wild
but
mary
was
not
afraid
once
in
talking
about
her
trips
through
the
jungle
mary
said
my
great
help
and
comfort
was
prayer
i
did
not
used
to
believe
the
story
of
daniel
in
the
lions
den
until
i
had
to
take
some
of
those
awful
marches
through
the
jungle
then
i
knew
it
was
true
many
times
i
walked
alone
praying
god
of
daniel
shut
their
mouths
and
he
did
after
pushing
on
through
the
darkness
mary
saw
the
dim
outlines
of
the
huts
of
the
village
all
was
quiet
suddenly
she
heard
the
swift
patter
of
bare
feet
she
was
surrounded
by
warriors
shouting
pushing
and
shaking
their
spears
what
have
you
come
for
asked
the
chief
i
have
heard
a
young
man
is
hurt
i
come
to
help
him
i
also
heard
that
you
are
going
to
war
i
have
come
to
ask
you
not
to
fight
said
mary
the
chief
talked
with
some
of
his
men
then
he
came
up
to
mary
the
white
ma
is
welcome
he
said
she
shall
hear
all
we
have
to
say
before
we
fight
all
the
same
we
shall
fight
here
is
my
son
wounded
by
the
enemy
we
must
wipe
out
the
shame
put
on
us
we
must
get
even
for
this
bad
thing
now
ma
you
may
give
my
son
your
medicine
then
you
must
rest
women
you
take
care
of
the
white
ma
we
will
call
her
at
cockcrow
when
we
start
mary
fixed
the
young
man
hand
then
she
laid
down
in
one
of
the
huts
for
an
hour
sleep
it
seemed
as
though
her
eyes
were
hardly
shut
before
she
heard
a
voice
calling
her
ma
they
are
going
to
battle
run
ma
run
the
warriors
were
on
the
warpath
mary
could
hear
their
wild
yells
and
the
roll
of
the
war
drums
mary
ran
after
them
she
was
tired
from
the
hard
trip
to
their
village
she
was
weak
from
the
sickness
she
had
but
nothing
could
stop
her
she
caught
up
with
the
warriors
just
as
they
were
getting
ready
to
attack
an
enemy
village
behave
like
men
she
yelled
not
like
fools
be
quiet
now
do
not
yell
and
shout
the
warriors
became
silent
god
says
that
revenge
is
wrong
said
mary
he
will
pay
back
wicked
people
for
the
wrong
things
they
do
you
should
not
try
to
get
even
leave
that
to
god
no
no
said
the
chief
if
we
do
not
pay
back
for
the
wrong
done
us
the
tribe
will
not
be
afraid
of
us
they
will
do
more
bad
things
to
us
yes
yes
shouted
the
warriors
they
kept
shouting
and
shaking
their
swords
and
guns
did
the
whole
village
hurt
you
did
the
whole
village
shoot
the
young
man
when
you
fight
against
the
village
you
will
hurt
many
women
and
children
they
are
innocent
they
have
done
nothing
let
us
pray
to
god
about
it
all
the
warriors
were
quiet
as
mary
prayed
she
asked
god
to
please
stop
the
war
if
it
was
his
will
she
prayed
for
the
young
man
who
had
been
hurt
she
prayed
for
whoever
it
was
that
hurt
him
that
he
might
turn
away
from
his
wickedness
and
become
a
christian
she
prayed
for
the
people
of
the
village
then
mary
spoke
to
the
warriors
you
stay
here
she
said
i
am
going
over
to
the
village
fearlessly
she
walked
over
to
where
the
line
of
village
warriors
were
drawn
up
with
their
swords
and
spears
hello
said
mary
the
warriors
said
nothing
mary
looked
over
the
angry
faces
then
she
laughed
nice
bunch
she
said
is
this
the
way
you
welcome
lady
visitors
the
warriors
stirred
uneasily
they
did
not
say
anything
where
is
your
chief
asked
mary
surely
he
is
not
afraid
to
talk
to
me
an
old
chief
stepped
out
from
behind
the
village
warriors
to
surprise
he
kneeled
down
in
front
of
her
ma
he
said
we
thank
you
for
coming
it
is
true
we
shot
the
young
man
the
young
chief
of
those
who
have
come
to
fight
us
but
it
was
one
man
who
did
it
the
whole
village
was
not
at
fault
please
make
peace
tell
us
what
we
must
do
mary
looked
into
the
face
of
the
chief
it
was
chief
okurike
long
ago
she
had
made
a
hard
trip
through
the
jungle
in
pouring
rain
to
help
when
he
was
deathly
sick
because
of
what
she
had
done
then
he
was
now
at
her
feet
asking
her
to
make
peace
mary
shook
hands
with
chief
okurike
then
she
spoke
to
his
warriors
stay
where
you
are
she
said
some
of
you
find
a
place
where
i
can
sit
in
comfort
i
am
hungry
bring
me
breakfast
i
will
not
starve
while
men
fight
the
warriors
did
as
she
told
them
now
she
said
choose
two
or
three
men
to
speak
for
you
we
shall
have
a
palaver
in
that
way
we
will
settle
this
thing
the
four
men
met
and
talked
with
one
another
while
mary
ate
breakfast
why
do
you
want
to
fight
and
kill
because
one
drunken
man
wounded
your
young
chief
mary
asked
the
men
from
the
fighting
tribe
let
the
tribe
of
the
drunken
youth
pay
a
fine
a
long
talk
followed
sometimes
it
became
very
exciting
the
arguing
grew
loud
the
father
of
the
young
man
wanted
to
have
the
man
who
had
shot
him
punished
hard
when
the
men
became
angry
mary
would
stop
them
let
us
pray
about
this
mary
would
say
after
she
had
prayed
they
would
settle
the
point
finally
mary
and
her
god
won
out
the
fighting
tribe
at
last
agreed
to
be
satisfied
with
a
fine
the
village
paid
the
fine
they
did
not
use
money
so
the
fine
was
paid
in
barrels
and
bottles
of
trade
gin
now
mary
was
worried
what
should
she
do
she
knew
the
warriors
would
drink
the
gin
right
away
she
knew
this
would
make
them
fight
after
all
in
spite
of
their
promises
a
quick
thought
came
to
her
according
to
the
law
of
these
people
clothes
thrown
over
anything
gave
it
the
protection
of
your
body
no
one
else
could
touch
it
mary
snatched
off
her
skirt
she
took
off
all
the
clothes
she
could
spare
she
spread
them
over
the
barrels
and
bottles
now
no
one
could
touch
them
mary
took
the
one
glass
the
tribe
had
she
gave
one
glassful
to
each
chief
to
show
that
there
was
no
trick
and
that
the
barrels
and
bottles
were
really
filled
with
gin
then
she
spoke
to
them
about
fighting
if
all
of
you
go
to
your
homes
and
do
fight
said
mary
i
promise
to
send
the
stuff
after
you
i
must
go
away
i
have
been
sick
and
i
must
go
where
i
can
get
strong
again
i
am
going
across
the
great
waters
to
my
home
i
shall
be
away
many
moons
will
you
promise
me
that
you
will
not
fight
while
i
am
gone
it
will
make
me
very
happy
if
you
will
make
that
promise
it
will
make
me
sad
if
you
do
for
i
will
always
be
wondering
whether
you
are
fighting
and
hurting
one
another
i
will
promise
said
the
chief
of
the
village
if
the
other
chief
will
all
the
warriors
looked
at
the
chief
whose
son
had
been
hurt
for
a
long
time
he
said
nothing
his
tribe
had
always
been
fighters
it
would
be
hard
for
them
to
give
up
fighting
the
chief
rubbed
his
chin
he
scratched
his
head
yes
ma
he
said
finally
i
will
promise
that
we
will
not
fight
while
you
are
gone
the
two
villages
kept
the
promise
made
by
their
chiefs
when
mary
came
back
the
two
chiefs
could
say
it
is
peace
mary
was
very
tired
slowly
she
tramped
through
the
hot
jungle
after
many
hours
she
came
to
ekenge
we
have
sent
your
trunks
and
things
on
ahead
said
chief
edem
here
are
my
best
rowers
and
best
soldiers
they
are
ready
to
take
you
to
duke
town
mary
once
more
stepped
into
the
canoe
this
time
there
was
no
one
to
call
her
back
little
black
janie
whom
mary
had
adopted
was
with
her
ma
shouted
the
crowd
god
keep
you
safe
and
bring
you
back
to
us
again
the
rowers
pulled
their
oars
strongly
and
swiftly
down
the
slow
moving
river
went
the
canoe
three
years
mary
had
spent
in
okoyong
already
she
had
seen
a
change
in
the
heathen
people
a
greater
change
was
still
to
come
mary
was
going
to
see
more
of
the
power
the
gospel
has
to
change
heathen
hearts
and
lives
mary
wrote
to
the
mission
board
charles
and
i
are
very
much
in
love
we
would
like
to
be
married
charles
is
a
wonderful
christian
and
a
very
fine
teacher
he
would
be
a
very
great
help
in
my
jungle
work
we
hope
that
you
will
agree
to
our
marriage
and
let
charles
go
into
the
jungle
with
me
i
am
ready
to
do
what
you
say
i
lay
the
whole
matter
in
god
hands
and
will
take
from
him
what
he
sees
best
for
his
work
in
okoyong
my
life
was
laid
on
the
altar
for
that
people
long
ago
and
i
would
not
take
one
jot
or
tittle
of
it
back
if
it
be
for
his
glory
and
the
advantage
of
his
cause
there
to
let
another
join
in
it
i
will
be
grateful
if
not
i
will
be
grateful
anyway
for
god
knows
best
the
board
was
very
much
surprised
to
get
this
letter
if
the
board
members
had
thought
about
it
at
all
they
had
thought
that
mary
would
never
marry
she
was
years
old
and
charles
morrison
her
sweetheart
was
he
was
a
mission
teacher
at
duke
town
the
difference
in
their
ages
did
not
bother
the
sweethearts
they
met
and
had
fallen
in
love
they
wanted
to
marry
i
will
marry
you
if
the
mission
board
will
agree
to
letting
you
work
in
the
jungle
with
me
said
mary
but
suppose
the
board
will
not
let
me
go
into
the
jungle
would
you
be
willing
to
come
back
to
duke
town
with
me
asked
charles
no
charles
i
could
i
love
you
very
much
more
than
anyone
i
have
ever
known
but
my
work
for
god
is
in
the
jungles
there
no
one
else
has
yet
planted
the
gospel
seed
to
leave
a
field
like
okoyong
without
a
worker
and
go
to
one
like
duke
town
with
ten
or
a
dozen
workers
where
the
people
have
the
bible
and
plenty
of
privileges
that
foolish
if
god
does
not
send
you
into
the
jungle
with
me
then
you
must
do
your
work
and
i
must
do
mine
where
we
have
been
placed
it
was
not
long
after
mary
had
returned
to
england
that
the
mission
board
gave
its
answer
to
her
request
the
answer
was
no
what
the
lord
decides
is
right
said
mary
i
believe
that
the
mission
board
is
giving
me
god
answer
because
they
are
his
servants
what
mary
suffered
no
one
knew
she
longed
to
have
a
life
partner
by
her
side
in
the
great
work
of
bringing
the
gospel
to
the
jungle
but
having
given
her
life
to
god
she
felt
that
he
must
be
her
first
love
charles
morrison
however
took
the
refusal
very
hard
he
became
sick
and
had
to
go
home
later
he
went
to
america
where
he
died
now
that
mary
was
home
in
england
she
soon
got
over
the
jungle
fevers
people
wanted
to
hear
about
the
missionary
work
in
africa
mary
went
from
church
to
church
telling
about
her
work
she
did
not
like
to
do
this
she
would
rather
be
in
the
jungle
telling
the
natives
about
jesus
it
is
hard
for
me
to
speak
said
mary
but
jesus
has
asked
me
to
do
it
and
it
is
an
honor
to
speak
for
him
i
wish
to
do
it
cheerfully
everywhere
people
were
thrilled
to
hear
about
the
work
for
jesus
in
the
jungle
they
wanted
to
do
something
too
they
gave
money
they
sent
boxes
of
clothes
and
food
and
other
things
out
to
africa
to
help
the
heathen
then
mary
got
sick
with
influenza
and
bronchitis
she
could
not
go
around
speaking
any
more
instead
she
wrote
some
articles
for
a
missionary
paper
the
gospel
must
be
preached
to
the
people
of
calabar
she
said
then
the
people
ought
to
be
taught
some
trades
they
should
learn
to
be
carpenters
and
farmers
and
the
like
we
ought
to
send
out
people
who
can
teach
them
these
trades
so
that
they
can
make
a
living
this
was
a
new
idea
to
many
people
they
wrote
to
other
missionaries
to
find
out
what
they
thought
about
it
later
a
school
the
hope
waddell
training
institute
was
started
this
school
taught
the
boys
and
girls
of
calabar
many
trades
mary
was
slow
in
getting
well
she
and
janie
the
black
girl
she
had
brought
with
her
went
to
the
southern
part
of
england
where
the
climate
was
milder
it
was
hoped
that
the
sea
breezes
and
the
mild
climate
would
bring
back
her
health
days
and
weeks
went
by
little
by
little
mary
got
better
the
year
came
to
an
end
the
bells
rang
in
the
new
year
soon
we
can
go
back
to
dear
calabar
said
mary
oh
how
i
want
to
get
back
and
tell
more
people
there
about
the
lord
jesus
in
february
mary
and
janie
sailed
for
calabar
what
new
adventures
awaited
them
in
africa
welcome
home
ma
welcome
shouted
the
people
of
okoyong
god
bless
you
praise
the
lord
for
sending
you
back
to
us
when
mary
came
back
to
okoyong
things
were
much
different
from
what
they
had
been
the
first
time
she
came
now
there
was
a
fine
mission
house
churches
and
schoolhouses
had
been
built
in
many
of
the
villages
the
people
were
slowly
but
surely
turning
away
from
their
heathen
customs
formerly
no
chief
ever
died
without
the
sacrifice
of
many
human
lives
but
this
was
not
done
any
more
one
of
the
chiefs
said
ma
you
white
people
are
god
almighty
no
other
power
could
have
done
this
there
were
still
many
chiefs
who
liked
to
go
to
war
and
to
fight
with
other
tribes
but
mary
had
friends
who
would
tell
her
of
the
plans
of
these
chiefs
she
would
have
to
go
to
them
and
persuade
them
not
to
fight
one
of
mary
dearest
friends
was
ma
eme
when
she
would
hear
of
trouble
she
would
send
a
messenger
to
mary
with
a
medicine
bottle
this
would
mean
be
ready
for
trouble
mary
was
so
good
at
settling
the
arguments
between
the
chiefs
that
the
british
government
made
her
a
this
was
something
like
a
governor
and
judge
the
jungle
people
would
not
let
the
white
men
come
and
make
new
laws
or
settle
their
arguments
but
they
did
listen
to
mary
she
was
a
very
fair
and
honest
judge
the
people
loved
and
obeyed
her
but
life
was
not
easy
not
all
the
natives
were
christians
even
those
who
were
were
not
always
good
christians
but
would
sometimes
slip
back
into
the
old
heathen
ways
then
it
was
hard
for
mary
and
her
helpers
to
get
to
the
different
places
there
were
no
easy
roads
through
the
jungles
and
wild
animals
were
always
there
ready
to
kill
the
careless
traveler
mary
received
many
gifts
both
from
the
natives
and
from
her
friends
in
england
and
scotland
one
of
the
gifts
she
loved
the
best
was
a
little
steamboat
which
the
natives
called
smoking
canoe
the
boys
and
girls
in
scotland
had
given
the
money
to
buy
this
boat
but
mary
was
not
satisfied
she
did
not
want
to
take
life
easy
as
soon
as
she
had
built
a
church
and
the
people
were
beginning
to
become
civilized
she
wanted
to
move
on
to
wilder
places
i
want
to
start
new
work
said
mary
let
those
who
are
younger
and
who
have
not
been
in
this
work
as
long
as
i
have
take
the
places
where
the
work
has
been
begun
many
of
mary
friends
among
the
natives
had
gone
to
akpap
which
was
a
village
south
of
ekenge
this
village
was
about
six
miles
from
the
cross
river
it
was
a
large
trading
center
many
heathen
came
to
this
village
to
trade
their
goods
for
other
things
they
wanted
mary
wrote
to
the
mission
board
and
asked
them
to
let
her
begin
work
in
this
new
place
we
can
not
at
this
time
let
you
start
work
at
akpap
wrote
the
mission
board
to
start
there
we
would
have
to
build
a
mission
house
and
we
do
not
have
the
money
for
that
besides
the
nearest
landing
place
is
ikunetu
this
is
six
miles
from
akpap
the
forests
are
wild
and
hard
to
get
through
we
believe
you
should
continue
the
work
at
ekenge
mary
wrote
again
and
again
trying
to
persuade
the
board
to
let
her
start
work
at
akpap
at
last
the
mission
board
agreed
to
let
her
start
work
there
they
promised
to
build
a
mission
house
and
a
boathouse
for
her
steamboat
mary
did
not
wait
for
the
house
to
be
built
in
she
built
a
native
shed
here
she
began
her
work
the
house
was
not
as
good
as
the
first
house
she
built
in
ekenge
this
did
not
bother
mary
she
was
more
concerned
about
bringing
the
gospel
to
the
heathen
the
work
here
was
like
that
in
ekenge
the
chiefs
came
with
the
troubles
they
were
having
in
their
tribes
they
wanted
her
advice
the
people
came
with
their
family
problems
and
wanted
her
to
tell
them
what
to
do
there
were
many
heathen
people
who
came
from
the
jungle
to
visit
her
mary
taught
her
classes
she
conducted
sunday
services
she
was
busy
all
the
time
then
one
day
the
smallpox
sickness
broke
out
you
must
all
be
vaccinated
said
mary
to
the
natives
i
will
scratch
your
arm
with
this
medicine
and
the
smallpox
will
stay
away
from
you
hour
after
hour
far
into
the
night
day
after
day
mary
vaccinated
the
natives
when
her
medicine
ran
out
she
took
blood
from
the
arms
of
those
who
had
been
vaccinated
to
use
as
vaccination
medicine
one
day
a
man
came
running
to
the
house
where
mary
was
living
in
akpap
he
had
run
a
long
way
he
was
scratched
up
and
sweating
he
had
run
through
the
jungle
without
stopping
ma
ma
he
cried
the
smallpox
sickness
has
come
to
ekenge
chief
ekponyong
and
chief
edem
are
sick
and
many
many
more
come
quick
oh
come
to
ekenge
or
we
shall
all
die
i
will
come
with
you
at
once
said
mary
to
the
messenger
from
ekenge
i
will
help
your
people
fight
the
smallpox
sickness
mary
went
back
to
ekenge
the
smallpox
sickness
was
very
bad
nearly
the
whole
village
was
sick
we
must
have
a
hospital
said
mary
i
know
what
we
will
do
we
will
make
my
house
here
a
hospital
soon
the
house
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
sick
people
she
had
to
be
doctor
nurse
and
undertaker
many
of
her
close
friends
died
chief
ekponyong
who
at
first
had
worked
against
mary
and
then
had
become
her
friend
died
chief
edem
the
chief
of
ekenge
was
very
sick
the
tired
missionary
did
everything
she
could
to
save
the
old
heathen
life
but
one
dark
night
he
died
mary
was
all
alone
mary
made
a
coffin
for
the
chief
she
put
his
body
in
it
then
she
dug
a
grave
she
dragged
the
coffin
to
the
grave
and
buried
it
completely
tired
out
she
dragged
herself
back
to
akpap
just
at
this
time
mr
ovens
and
another
missionary
came
up
from
duke
town
they
came
to
mary
hut
at
akpap
all
was
still
and
quiet
mr
ovens
looked
at
the
other
missionary
something
is
wrong
he
said
he
knocked
loudly
at
the
door
he
knocked
and
knocked
again
finally
mary
awoke
and
opened
the
door
the
missionaries
saw
how
tired
and
sick
she
looked
what
is
wrong
asked
ovens
mary
told
them
about
the
sickness
at
ekenge
she
told
them
of
what
she
had
done
i
do
see
how
you
could
have
done
that
work
alone
said
mr
ovens
wo
you
go
and
bury
the
rest
of
the
dead
asked
mary
i
was
just
too
tired
to
do
it
yes
we
will
said
mr
ovens
the
two
missionaries
went
to
ekenge
there
they
found
the
mission
house
filled
with
dead
bodies
they
buried
these
people
and
preached
to
those
who
were
still
living
about
the
saviour
mary
was
weak
and
sick
but
she
kept
right
on
working
in
one
of
her
letters
to
a
friend
she
tells
about
some
of
her
work
four

at
my
feet

read
slowly
from
the
bible
then
she
explained
the
bible
reading
to
the
children
and
prayed
then
she
sang
a
song
in
the
native
language
the
tune
was
a
scottish
melody
and
as
she
sang
she
kept
time
with
a
tamborine
if
any
of
the
children
did
not
pay
attention
mary
would
lean
forward
and
tap
his
head
with
the
tamborine
mary
did
not
get
her
strength
back
she
was
not
well
the
mission
committee
at
calabar
decided
that
even
though
they
had
no
worker
to
take
her
place
she
must
go
home
on
a
vacation
which
was
long
overdue
but
who
will
take
care
of
the
work
at
akpap
asked
mary
mr
ovens
the
carpenter
who
is
building
the
mission
house
at
akpap
can
do
the
work
until
we
find
someone
to
take
your
place
answered
the
chairman
of
the
committee
but
what
shall
i
do
with
my
many
black
children
i
do
want
them
to
go
back
to
heathen
ways
of
living
while
i
am
gone
i
do
like
to
ask
the
other
mission
workers
to
take
care
of
them
for
me
do
worry
mary
we
will
find
places
for
them
places
were
found
for
all
the
adopted
children
except
the
four
black
children
whom
she
planned
to
take
along
with
her
these
were
janie
who
was
now
sixteen
years
old
mary
was
five
alice
three
and
maggie
was
only
eighteen
months
old
now
mary
had
to
find
ways
of
clothing
the
children
the
rags
they
wore
in
the
jungle
would
not
do
for
the
trip
to
scotland
mary
took
her
trouble
to
the
lord
and
he
wonderfully
answered
her
prayer
when
she
reached
duke
town
she
found
that
a
missionary
box
had
just
come
and
it
had
just
the
things
she
needed
mary
took
her
children
on
board
the
big
ship
it
was
the
biggest
canoe
that
any
of
the
children
except
janie
had
ever
seen
we
on
our
way
to
bonny
scotland
said
mary
and
the
other
missionaries
at
calabar
said
mary
work
as
hard
if
not
harder
than
i
do
we
need
more
workers
to
preach
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
for
your
lost
black
brothers
and
sisters
they
have
souls
just
as
you
do
jesus
loves
them
just
as
he
does
you
we
must
tell
them
of
his
love
i
would
like
to
go
farther
inland
to
people
who
have
never
heard
the
gospel
and
make
a
home
among
the
cannibals
mary
was
giving
a
talk
at
one
of
the
churches
as
soon
as
she
was
well
enough
to
make
speeches
many
of
the
churches
wanted
to
hear
her
the
people
were
very
much
interested
in
the
black
children
she
had
adopted
and
brought
with
her
many
of
them
had
never
seen
black
people
before
mary
had
some
trouble
speaking
in
english
for
many
years
now
she
had
been
speaking
almost
all
the
time
in
the
african
language
it
was
sometimes
hard
for
her
to
say
the
right
english
words
but
the
holy
spirit
helped
her
and
the
people
remembered
her
talks
and
gave
generously
for
the
work
in
late
in
the
year
mary
and
the
black
children
got
on
the
big
canoe
and
sailed
back
to
africa
they
spent
a
happy
christmas
on
the
ship
once
more
strong
and
well
mary
went
back
to
work
in
akpap
she
taught
the
children
and
grownups
she
healed
the
sick
she
visited
in
the
bush
and
in
the
jungle
during
this
time
mary
had
the
joy
of
seeing
six
young
men
become
christians
these
young
men
she
trained
and
sent
to
the
neighboring
villages
as
gospel
workers
she
had
hoped
for
more
helpers
but
was
grateful
that
god
had
given
her
these
more
and
more
of
the
jungle
people
heard
about
her
bushmen
traveled
hundreds
of
miles
to
see
the
white
ma
who
told
them
about
jesus
mary
used
every
chance
she
had
to
tell
the
gospel
to
heathen
who
had
never
heard
it
the
stories
the
visiting
people
told
about
their
lands
and
the
inland
tribes
filled
mary
with
the
desire
to
explore
other
parts
of
the
country
often
in
the
mission
boat
or
in
a
canoe
she
traveled
to
villages
farther
away
on
one
trip
the
canoe
in
which
mary
was
riding
was
attacked
by
a
hippopotamus
mary
thought
her
end
had
come
nevertheless
she
bravely
fought
off
the
animal
using
metal
cooking
pots
and
pans
as
weapons
in
the
southern
part
of
nigeria
was
a
strong
wild
tribe
called
the
aros
they
were
a
proud
but
wicked
people
they
made
war
on
peaceful
tribes
they
would
steal
people
from
peaceful
villages
and
make
them
slaves
they
prayed
to
the
devil
and
they
killed
people
as
human
sacrifices
to
please
their
idols
they
were
cannibals
who
ate
people
the
government
decided
to
make
this
tribe
stop
doing
these
bad
things
a
small
band
of
soldiers
was
sent
against
this
tribe
to
make
them
obey
this
made
mary
sad
she
knew
that
sending
soldiers
to
fight
against
these
people
would
not
change
them
she
knew
that
only
the
gospel
could
change
the
black
men
hearts
she
wished
she
could
go
to
this
tribe
with
the
gospel
of
jesus
but
the
government
said
no
the
government
officers
feared
there
might
be
a
tribal
war
which
would
even
come
to
okoyong
they
decided
that
mary
would
be
safer
in
creek
town
than
akpap
sadly
mary
left
her
friends
and
spent
three
months
in
creek
town
her
okoyong
friends
did
not
forget
her
they
came
often
to
visit
her
and
brought
her
gifts
they
also
brought
their
quarrels
to
her
to
settle
they
called
her
their
queen
finally
mary
was
allowed
to
go
back
to
akpap
three
years
went
by
it
was
now
fifteen
years
since
mary
had
first
come
to
okoyong
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
that
she
came
a
celebration
was
held
seven
young
men
whom
mary
had
won
for
christ
were
baptized
the
rev
weir
a
missionary
from
creek
town
helped
in
organizing
the
first
okoyong
christian
church
the
following
sunday
the
church
was
filled
to
overflowing
mary
presented
eleven
children
for
baptism
the
supper
was
served
for
the
first
time
to
natives
and
white
workers
who
had
accepted
christ
as
their
saviour
after
songs
had
been
sung
and
speeches
made
by
others
mary
got
up
to
speak
you
must
build
a
church
large
enough
to
take
care
of
all
who
come
to
hear
god
word
okoyong
now
looks
to
you
who
have
accepted
christ
as
your
saviour
and
who
have
joined
the
church
for
proof
of
the
power
of
the
gospel
more
than
it
looks
to
me
i
am
very
happy
over
all
that
has
been
done
these
past
fifteen
years
but
it
is
god
who
did
it
to
him
belongs
all
the
glory
mission
houses
schools
and
a
church
have
been
built
wicked
heathen
customs
have
been
stopped
chiefs
have
quit
fighting
and
women
are
much
better
off
than
they
were
when
i
came
let
us
praise
god
for
this
and
let
us
go
on
and
do
greater
things
the
lord
will
help
us
and
will
bless
our
work
mary
was
happy
the
way
the
work
was
going
but
she
was
not
satisfied
she
wanted
to
go
to
other
places
this
cannibal
land
of
deep
darkness
with
woods
of
spooky
mystery
is
like
a
magnet
said
mary
slessor
it
draws
me
on
and
on
where
is
this
country
where
you
want
to
work
asked
miss
wright
one
of
the
teachers
at
the
girls
institute
at
calabar
it
lies
to
the
west
of
the
cross
river
it
stretches
for
miles
and
miles
toward
the
niger
river
have
any
missionaries
been
there
none
have
gone
into
the
forest
missionaries
and
traders
have
gone
along
the
edge
of
it
when
they
went
up
the
cross
river
what
tribes
live
in
this
dark
and
mysterious
country
asked
miss
wright
the
ibo
tribe
lives
in
most
of
the
country
but
they
are
ruled
by
the
aros
clan
said
mary
who
are
they
tell
me
something
about
them
mary
i
know
so
little
about
the
tribes
except
those
who
come
to
calabar
or
send
their
girls
to
our
institute
the
aros
clan
are
a
wise
but
tricky
people
they
live
in
thirty
villages
near
the
district
of
arochuku
where
i
would
like
to
begin
a
mission
they
are
strong
and
rule
the
ibo
tribe
because
of
their
trade
and
religion
they
trade
slaves
which
their
religion
furnishes
when
they
can
not
get
enough
slaves
that
way
they
raid
ibo
villages
and
capture
the
people
who
live
there
and
sell
them
you
say
their
religion
furnishes
them
with
slaves
how
is
that
possible
the
ibo
tribe
and
the
aros
pray
to
the
juju
god
they
believe
the
juju
god
lives
in
a
tree
they
think
this
tree
is
holy
each
village
has
its
own
god
and
sacred
tree
but
the
main
juju
used
to
be
about
a
mile
from
arochuku
but
you
have
told
me
about
the
slaves
interrupted
miss
wright
i
am
just
coming
to
that
said
mary
this
main
juju
called
the
long
juju
was
reached
by
a
winding
road
that
goes
through
a
dense
jungle
and
leads
at
last
to
a
lake
in
the
center
of
the
lake
is
an
island
on
which
was
the
long
juju
here
hundreds
of
people
came
to
ask
advice
from
the
priests
and
to
worship
when
the
people
came
here
the
aros
clan
had
captured
them
then
they
were
either
sold
as
slaves
sacrificed
to
juju
or
eaten
by
the
tribe
how
terrible
the
aros
are
tricky
one
of
their
tricks
was
to
throw
some
of
the
people
they
captured
into
the
water
the
water
at
once
turned
red
the
priests
would
tell
the
people
that
juju
had
eaten
the
men
the
people
believed
it
but
really
the
red
was
only
coloring
the
priests
had
thrown
into
the
river
is
the
juju
still
there
asked
miss
wright
no
the
british
soldiers
went
over
the
cross
river
they
had
a
battle
with
the
natives
and
beat
them
they
captured
arochuku
then
they
chopped
down
the
long
juju
but
of
course
the
natives
still
have
their
village
jujus
they
still
do
many
wicked
things
and
you
want
to
work
among
those
terrible
people
yes
do
you
think
they
have
a
great
need
for
the
gospel
oh
they
do
but
i
would
not
have
the
courage
to
work
among
them
i
have
no
courage
said
mary
except
what
god
gives
me
tell
me
mary
have
you
gone
into
that
country
at
all
i
have
made
some
short
exploration
trips
i
told
the
traders
to
tell
the
chiefs
that
some
day
i
would
come
to
their
country
to
live
but
their
only
answer
was
is
not
safe
that
is
what
the
people
told
me
when
i
wanted
to
go
to
okoyong
i
trust
in
my
heavenly
father
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
cannibals
no
matter
how
fierce
and
cruel
they
may
be
but
mary
did
you
know
that
when
a
chief
died
recently
fifty
or
more
people
were
eaten
at
the
funeral
ceremonies
and
others
had
their
heads
cut
off
and
were
buried
with
the
chief
yes
i
heard
that
but
things
were
almost
as
bad
when
i
came
to
okoyong
god
blessed
my
work
and
he
can
protect
me
in
this
strange
new
land
of
the
cannibals
i
do
hope
the
mission
board
will
let
me
go
and
work
among
the
aros
and
ibos
the
missionaries
in
calabar
wanted
mary
to
work
at
ikorofiong
and
at
unwana
which
were
two
towns
farther
up
the
cross
river
from
akpap
but
mary
did
not
think
these
were
good
places
for
her
work
she
wanted
to
be
where
she
could
reach
the
most
people
she
wanted
to
work
at
arochuku
the
chief
city
of
aros
which
was
also
near
the
efik
ibo
and
ibibio
tribes
she
wanted
to
open
her
first
station
at
itu
which
was
on
the
mouth
of
enyong
creek
her
second
station
at
arochuku
and
a
third
at
bende
the
missionaries
at
calabar
did
not
agree
but
they
decided
to
wait
until
a
worker
could
be
found
to
take
mary
place
at
akpap
mary
would
not
reave
these
people
until
they
could
be
taken
care
of
by
christian
workers
send
a
minister
to
take
care
of
a
station
i
can
not
build
up
a
church
the
way
a
minister
can
said
mary
it
looked
as
though
mary
would
not
get
to
go
to
the
land
of
aros
then
miss
wright
the
teacher
from
the
girls
institute
asked
to
be
sent
to
akpap
as
an
assistant
this
request
was
sent
to
scotland
for
the
board
to
approve
mary
now
decided
to
start
work
at
once
in
january
with
two
boys
esien
and
efiiom
and
a
girl
mana
whom
she
had
carefully
trained
she
loaded
her
canoe
with
food
and
other
supplies
and
set
off
for
the
land
of
the
cruel
cannibals
they
did
not
know
how
the
people
there
would
treat
them
but
they
trusted
in
god
to
take
care
of
them
and
help
them
in
their
work
mary
found
a
house
for
them
i
am
leaving
you
here
said
mary
to
the
three
natives
to
begin
a
school
and
hold
church
services
for
the
people
of
itu
i
must
go
back
to
akpap
but
i
will
come
again
as
soon
as
i
can
but
mary
had
to
stay
at
akpap
longer
than
she
expected
at
last
she
was
able
to
come
again
to
itu
and
to
visit
the
school
and
the
church
services
you
have
done
wonderfully
well
she
told
the
three
workers
god
has
blessed
your
work
my
heart
was
filled
with
joy
when
i
saw
so
many
people
young
and
old
at
the
services
and
your
school
is
filled
with
people
who
want
to
learn
book
and
learn
the
will
of
god
now
we
must
build
a
church
and
a
schoolhouse
mary
began
mixing
the
mud
and
doing
the
other
work
that
was
necessary
for
building
a
building
in
africa
the
native
workers
and
the
people
of
itu
helped
her
gladly
it
did
not
take
long
with
many
willing
hands
to
build
a
church
and
school
two
rooms
were
added
to
the
church
building
these
two
rooms
are
for
you
ma
the
people
said
you
must
have
a
place
to
stay
when
you
come
to
us
after
the
church
and
school
were
built
mary
went
back
to
akpap
here
she
heard
good
news
the
board
in
scotland
has
given
me
permission
to
be
your
assistant
at
akpap
said
miss
wright
wonderful
said
mary
now
i
can
spend
more
time
at
itu
and
more
time
in
the
jungle
on
a
beautiful
morning
in
june
mary
packed
her
clothes
and
supplies
and
marched
the
six
miles
down
to
the
landing
beach
at
ikunetu
here
she
waited
for
the
government
boat
which
would
take
her
to
itu
she
waited
and
waited
at
last
she
found
one
of
the
natives
and
asked
where
is
the
government
boat
is
it
late
no
ma
it
long
time
gone
so
mary
had
to
walk
back
six
miles
through
the
jungle
to
the
mission
house
at
akpap
why
mary
said
miss
wright
what
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
that
by
this
time
you
would
be
traveling
on
the
government
boat
to
itu
i
am
in
god
hands
said
mary
and
he
did
not
mean
for
me
to
travel
today
i
have
been
kept
back
for
some
good
purpose
the
next
week
when
she
again
made
the
trip
to
board
the
boat
colonel
montanaro
who
commanded
the
government
soldiers
in
that
part
of
the
country
was
on
the
boat
i
will
be
happy
to
have
you
travel
with
me
and
my
soldiers
said
the
colonel
you
will
be
safer
that
way
i
am
going
to
arochuku
that
is
just
what
i
would
like
to
do
said
mary
now
i
see
why
god
did
not
let
me
travel
last
week
i
have
been
wanting
for
a
long
time
to
visit
the
chief
city
of
the
aros
i
want
to
see
more
about
this
juju
religion
some
time
before
the
government
had
sent
soldiers
into
the
country
to
make
the
chiefs
stop
the
juju
worship
the
chiefs
had
promised
to
stop
it
but
it
still
went
on
secretly
after
reaching
arochuku
mary
followed
the
jungle
paths
over
which
the
slaves
had
been
made
to
walk
for
hundreds
of
years
she
came
to
the
place
of
the
long
juju
there
mary
saw
the
human
skulls
the
bones
and
the
pots
in
which
the
bodies
had
been
cooked
mary
shivered
when
she
thought
of
the
cannibal
feasts
mary
thought
the
people
might
be
against
her
but
instead
they
welcomed
her
they
had
heard
about
the
good
things
she
had
done
in
the
jungle
o
god
prayed
mary
i
want
to
bring
the
gospel
to
these
for
whom
christ
died
please
dear
god
make
the
home
church
and
the
mission
board
see
the
great
need
here
so
that
they
will
let
me
win
this
part
of
the
country
for
christ
mary
promised
the
people
of
arochuku
she
would
come
again
and
open
a
school
then
she
returned
to
akpap
and
wrote
the
mission
board
for
permission
to
open
a
station
at
arochuku
soon
the
answer
came
back
we
are
sorry
but
it
will
be
impossible
at
this
time
to
open
work
at
arochuku
we
do
not
have
the
money
or
the
workers
the
the
mission
board
says
that
they
can
not
open
a
mission
station
at
arochuku
now
said
mary
i
have
asked
god
to
give
me
a
mission
station
where
his
gospel
can
be
preached
to
the
aros
i
trust
in
christ
who
is
able
to
do
more
than
i
am
able
to
ask
or
think
i
know
god
will
give
me
what
i
have
asked
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
asked
miss
wright
i
am
going
to
do
what
i
believe
god
wants
me
to
do
i
am
going
to
take
some
native
christians
and
make
a
beginning
in
the
land
of
the
aros
mary
took
some
native
boys
whom
she
had
trained
they
were
able
to
help
with
and
church
services
mary
and
the
boys
went
to
amasu
a
little
village
which
was
nearer
the
creek
than
arochuku
here
she
opened
a
school
it
was
soon
filled
with
boys
and
girls
thirsty
for
book
and
the
loving
god
she
held
church
services
for
the
people
and
many
of
them
came
to
hear
the
white
ma
teach
about
jesus
at
last
it
was
time
for
mary
to
go
back
to
akpap
she
left
the
native
christians
to
carry
on
the
work
of
the
school
and
church
the
people
of
the
village
gathered
around
her
they
said
come
again
soon
white
ma
if
you
do
not
care
for
us
who
will
care
for
us
as
mary
went
down
the
river
in
her
canoe
she
thanked
god
that
he
had
let
her
open
this
new
field
to
the
gospel
suddenly
there
was
a
canoe
barring
her
way
in
it
was
a
tall
native
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
my
master
at
akani
obio
sent
me
to
stop
you
and
bring
you
to
his
house
mary
told
her
rowers
to
follow
the
native
to
his
master
place
soon
they
came
to
a
trading
place
here
mary
was
greeted
by
a
handsome
young
man

onoyom
iya
nya
the
president
of

court
and
the
chief
of

to
a
house
which
was
very
nicely
furnished
onoyom

some
food
with
them
while
they

many
times

onoyom
but
they
never

i
am
happy
that
you
have
come
but
why
did
you
seek
me
why
did
you
want
me
to
come
to
you
asked
mary
when
i
was
a
boy
said
onoyom
i
served
as
a
guide
to
a
missionary
he
told
me
the
gospel
story
i
wanted
jesus
for
my
saviour
but
my
tribe
beat
me
and
punished
me
in
other
ways
until
i
gave
up
the
white
man
religion
and
followed
the
juju
religion
of
the
tribe
i
took
part
in
arochuku
feasts
where
we
ate
pig
that
is
men
and
women
but
why
do
you
want
to
talk
to
me
asked
mary
i
never
forgot
what
the
missionary
told
me
about
christ
later
i
had
troubles
and
sickness
i
tried
witchcraft
to
find
the
person
who
placed
the
troubles
and
sickness
on
me
instead
i
met
a
white
man
he
said
to
me
do
you
know
it
is
not
the
god
of
the
white
man
who
is
angry
with
you
he
is
i
said
can
i
find
this
god
i
hoped
he
would
tell
me
but
he
said
am
not
worthy
to
tell
you
find
the
white
ma
who
goes
to
itu
and
she
will
tell
you
o
ma
please
tell
us
about
your
god
tears
of
joy
ran
down
mary
cheeks
onoyom
called
all
the
members
of
his
family
and
the
servants
together
mary
told
them
of
jesus
and
his
power
to
save
them
she
read
from
the
bible
prayed
with
the
people
and
promised
to
come
back
again
on
her
next
trip
i
will
build
a
church
for
you
said
chief
onoyom
i
have
money
i
will
give
for
a
mission
house
and
school
as
mary
rode
down
the
enyong
creek
she
thought
of
the
new
missionary
work
that
was
opening
up
o
god
she
prayed
i
thank
you
for
the
new
places
at
itu
and
amasu
i
thank
you
for
the
chance
to
build
a
church
at
akani
obio
please
let
me
open
a
station
soon
at
arochuku
there
with
your
blessing
i
hope
to
conquer
the
cannibals
for
christ
i
do
hope
she
said
to
herself
that
the
board
will
soon
send
an
ordained
minister
to
take
over
the
akpap
station
i
must
persuade
miss
wright
to
go
with
me
to
itu
i
am
sure
god
will
give
her
courage
to
come
with
me
this
enyong
creek
region
will
give
us
all
the
work
for
christ
we
can
handle
and
more
we
must
go
forward
for
christ
mary
made
many
trips
to
akpap
to
itu
and
amasu
she
stopped
at
many
little
villages
and
lonely
huts
along
enyong
creek
to
tell
the
people
about
the
saviour
who
had
died
also
for
those
with
black
skins
often
she
slept
on
mud
floors
she
ate
yams
and
native
fruits
god
blessed
the
work
at
itu
and
amasu
the
people
of
itu
built
a
church
and
more
than
three
hundred
of
them
attended
the
services
at
amasu
the
school
pew
fast
the
natives
were
learning
to
read
the
natives
at
itu
started
to
build
a
house
at
itu
for
mary
it
was
to
be
one
of
the
finest
homes
in
which
the
missionary
had
ever
lived
i
am
afraid
it
is
too
much
work
for
you
said
mary
to
the
natives
it
is
too
big
no
it
is
not
too
much
said
the
people
of
itu
nothing
is
too
much
to
do
for
you
we
shall
do
it
another
time
a
native
woman
knelt
at
mary
feet
she
washed
mary
tired
feet
in
warm
water
you
are
so
kind
to
me
said
mary
thanking
her
i
have
been
so
afraid
ma
that
you
would
think
us
unworthy
of
a
teacher
and
take
her
away
said
the
woman
i
could
not
live
again
in
darkness
i
pray
all
the
time
i
lay
my
basket
down
and
pray
on
the
road
that
is
good
said
mary
prayer
can
do
anything
i
know
i
have
tested
it
of
course
god
does
not
always
answer
our
prayers
the
way
we
want
them
answered
but
he
does
answer
them
and
in
the
way
that
is
best
for
us
trust
god
always
one
day
mary
thought
of
a
new
plan
she
wanted
to
try
out
she
had
been
in
the
jungle
for
five
years
she
was
due
to
get
a
year
vacation
at
home
in
scotland
instead
of
this
she
asked
for
something
else
she
wrote
to
the
mission
board
i
would
like
to
have
leave
from
the
mission
station
at
akpap
for
six
months
this
time
i
would
spend
traveling
between
okoyong
and
amasu
i
would
visit
many
places
which
i
do
not
have
time
to
visit
now
already
i
have
seen
a
church
and
a
mission
house
built
at
itu
and
a
school
and
a
couple
of
rooms
at
amasu
i
have
visited
several
towns
at
enyong
and
have
found
good
enough
places
to
stay
i
shall
find
my
own
canoe
and
crew
i
shall
stay
at
any
one
place
just
as
long
as
i
think

members
of
my
family
she
meant
the
twins
and
slave
children
and
other
unwanted
children

had
adopted

in
teaching
the
beginners
in
the
schools

plan
to
live
at
itu
as
my
headquarters
i
will
look
after
the
small
schools
i
have
started
at
idot
and
eki
i
will
visit
and
work
for
jesus
in
the
towns
on
both
sides
of
enyong
creek
all
the
way
to
amasu
i
will
live
there
for
a
while
or
travel
among
the
aros
telling
them
of
jesus
then
i
will
come
back
by
easy
stages
to
itu
and
home
please
send
an
assistant
to
help
miss
wright
at
akpap
so
i
will
be
free
to
do
this
new
work
in
the
jungle
i
would
like
miss
wright
to
help
me
with
some
work
among
the
cannibals
in
some
places
so
that
i
will
have
more
time
for
pioneer
work
in
the
places
farther
away
itu
should
be
our
main
station
we
can
reach
the
various
tribes
best
from
it
it
is
the
gateway
to
the
aros
and
the
ibibios
and
near
many
other
tribes
that
is
why
it
became
a
slave
market
it
could
be
reached
so
easily
it
is
only
a
day
journey
from
the
seaport
of
the
ocean
steamers
having
waterway
all
the
year
round
and
a
good
beach
front
itu
is
a
natural
place
for
our
upriver
and
downriver
work
to
come
together
mary
was
now
years
old
she
had
suffered
much
from
sickness
and
from
the
lack
of
many
things
now
she
wanted
to
go
on
a
gypsying
tour
of
the
jungle
as
she
called
it
this
was
hard
and
difficult
work
there
were
many
dangers
from
wild
animals
and
wild
people
these
tribes
she
wanted
to
visit
did
not
know
anything
about
the
saviour
or
god
word
but
they
did
know
how
to
do
many
wicked
things
like
killing
and
eating
people
many
a
younger
and
stronger
person
than
mary
would
be
afraid
to
tackle
the
job
she
had
planned
to
do
mary
was
not
afraid
god
had
given
her
the
chance
to
reach
the
wild
cannibals
she
was
willing
to
die
trying
to
bring
the
gospel
to
them
i
am
willing
to
go
anywhere
said
mary
provided
it
be
forward
among
the
cannibals
mary
anxiously
waited
for
the
answer
from
the
mission
board
giving
her
permission
to
work
for
six
months
in
the
cannibal
country
the
answer
did
not
come
and
did
not
come
at
last
she
decided
to
go
on
a
short
trip
through
that
country
to
encourage
the
black
workers
she
had
sent
there
she
went
to
see
the
wilkies
and
miss
wright
i
am
going
on
a
short
trip
through
the
cannibal
country
said
mary
i
am
inviting
you
to
be
my
guests
on
this
trip
i
want
you
to
see
what
god
is
doing
among
the
cannibals
wo
you
come
with
me
we
be
glad
to
go
with
you
said
wilkie
mary
and
her
friends
first
visited
itu
where
they
met
colonel
montanaro
who
had
first
taken
mary
to
itu
then
they
went
to
akani
obio
here
chief
onoyom
had
a
big
party
for
them
ma
when
are
you
going
to
come
and
stay
a
long
time
with
us
he
asked
i
want
you
to
bring
the
gospel
to
me
and
to
my
people
i
hope
it
will
be
soon
said
mary
i
am
praying
every
day
that
the
mission
board
will
let
me
work
in
your
country
mary
and
her
friends
now
went
to
amasu
to
see
the
gospel
work
that
was
being
done
there
then
they
visited
the
villages
around
arochuku
where
the
long
juju
was
then
they
started
back
to
akpap
they
visited
many
very
small
villages
on
the
way
back
everywhere
the
people
said
to
them
we
want
to
learn
book
they
meant
they
wanted
someone
to
teach
them
to
read
the
bible
at
last
they
arrived
at
akpap
here
there
was
the
letter
from
the
mission
board
mary
hands
shook
as
she
opened
the
letter
would
it
give
her
permission
to
go
to
cannibal
land
or
would
it
tell
her
to
come
home
and
take
her
furlough
in
the
usual
way
you
may
make
the
jungle
trip
that
you
plan
but
you
will
have
to
pay
your
own
expenses
during
this
time
we
do
not
have
any
money
for
that
work
mary
was
happy
mary
took
the
little
money
she
had
and
bought
supplies
at
duke
town
then
she
got
her
canoe
ready
she
took
a
crew
of
black
rowers
to
row
the
canoe
and
a
group
of
the
black
children
she
had
adopted
it
seems
strange
to
be
starting
with
a
family
on
a
gypsy
life
in
a
canoe
wrote
mary
but
god
will
take
care
of
us
whether
i
shall
find
his
place
for
me
upriver
or
whether
i
shall
come
back
to
my
own
people
again
i
do
not
know
he
knows
and
that
is
enough
at
last
mary
and
her
group
of
travelers
came
to
itu
which
was
deep
in
cannibal
land
mary
had
started
the
work
here
and
then
left
native
workers
to
carry
on
now
there
were
three
hundred
people
in
the
church
mary
found
that
the
mission
house
at
itu
was
not
finished
mary
herself
mixed
the
cement
for
the
floor
while
janie
did
the
whitewashing
someone
asked
mary
how
she
learned
to
make
cement
i
just
stir
it
like
oatmeal
then
turn
it
out
smooth
with
a
stick
and
all
the
time
i
keep
praying
here
the
cement
if
it
is
to
your
glory
set
it
and
it
has
never
gone
wrong
every
day
mary
made
calls
and
helped
to
solve
the
problems
of
the
people
of
itu
in
the
evenings
she
would
hold
prayer
in
the
yards
of
many
of
the
people
always
mary
told
the
people
of
the
saviour
who
died
for
them
the
news
that
mary
the
white
ma
was
in
cannibal
land
soon
spread
far
and
wide
the
calling
through
the
jungle
told
the
different
tribes
where
mary
was
from
ibibio
southward
the
natives
sent
messages
to
mary

to
the
woods
the
chief

cried

down
the
juju
will
be
angry
he
will
not
let
us
he
will
kill
us
cried
the
people
ma
god
is
stronger
than
our
juju
said
chief
onoyom
cut
it
down
the
people
began
to
chop
the
trunk
of
the
tree
was
thick
after
a
while
they
stopped
see
we
can
not
cut
it
they
said
the
heathen
natives
were
glad
aha
they
said
our
juju
is
stronger
than
ma
god
the
next
morning
chief
onoyom
took
some
men
who
wanted
to
be
christians
before
beginning
to
chop
at
the
tree
they
knelt
and
prayed
that
the
white
ma
god
would
prove
stronger
than
the
juju
then
they
got
up
and
began
to
chop
soon
the
tree
fell
with
a
mighty
crash
ma
god
had
won
the
juju
tree
was
used
for
a
pulpit
and
seats
in
the
church
building
a
large
group
of
people
came
to
the
dedication
services
they
were
quiet
and
what
a
great
change
the
gospel
had
made
only
two
years
before
the
people
were
wild
savages
mary
had
to
hold
services
at
arochuku
but
now
the
people
built
a
church
and
a
schoolhouse
at
other
villages
along
enyong
creek
congregations
were
organized
and
churches
and
schoolhouses
were
built
in
mary
had
to
go
to
the
mission
council
meeting
at
calabar
during
the
meeting
mary
was
called
on
to
tell
about
her
work
god
has
done
great
things
in
cannibal
land
we
have
congregations
at
itu
arochuku
oko
akani
obio
odot
amasu
and
asang
in
all
of
these
places
churches
have
been
built
in
many
of
them
we
have
built
schoolhouses
too
many
of
the
cannibals
are
being
won
for
christ
but
we
need
more
workers
in
all
this
wide
country
of
the
aros
i
am
the
only
white
missionary
my
six
months
leave
is
almost
up
who
will
take
care
of
these
people
who
are
as
dear
to
god
as
you
or
i
now
they
are
being
taken
care
of
by
native
workers
but
these
have
only
little
training
send
workers
to
cannibal
land
to
change
these
into
christians
the
council
was
thrilled
by
mary
report
they
voted
that
she
could
spend
six
more
months
in
cannibal
land
but
again
they
said
she
would
have
to
pay
her
own
expenses
this
did
not
bother
mary
she
had
never
been
paid
much
salary
in
the
first
years
she
sent
most
of
it
back
home
to
take
care
of
her
mother
and
sister
after
they
had
died
she
used
me
most
of
it
for
her
colored
christians
she
had
adopted
many
black
children
whose
parents
had
thrown
them
out
but
money
never
bothered
mary
she
had
a
little
bit
saved
up
she
was
happy
that
she
could
go
to
cannibal
land
and
win
souls
for
christ
but
where
shall
i
work
now
mary
asked
herself
shall
i
keep
on
working
on
upper
enyong
creek
or
shall
i
go
south
to
the
ibibios
the
ibibios
are
the
worst
heathen
in
this
part
of
africa
the
worse
the
people
are
the
more
they
need
help
i
should
go
to
the
ibibios
meanwhile
the
mission
committee
in
scotland
decided
to
build
a
hospital
at
itu
robertson
was
to
be
the
head
of
it
the
mission
committee
chose
a
name
for
the
hospital
they
named
it
the
mary
slessor
mission
hospital
the
people
in
scotland
gave
the
money
so
the
hospital
could
be
built
it
seems
like
a
fairy
tale
said
mary
when
she
was
told
about
it
and
i
do
know
just
what
to
say
i
can
just
look
up
into
the
blue
sky
and
say
so
father
let
me
live
and
be
worthy
of
it
all
it
is
a
grand
gift
and
i
am
so
glad
for
my
people
now
that
itu
was
taken
care
of
mary
had
all
the
more
reason
to
go
south
to
the
ibibios
in
their
country
the
government
was
building
roads
and
setting
up
courts
the
government
people
wanted
mary
to
come
to
that
country
too
because
she
knew
so
much
more
about
the
people
and
customs
in
cannibal
land
get
a
bicycle
ma
said
one
of
the
government
men
here
is
the
road
come
as
far
as
you
can
and
we
soon
have
a
motorcar
for
you
mary
started
out
she
took
along
one
of
the
boys
she
had
adopted
it
was
etim
he
could
read
and
she
needed
his
help
once
more
mary
was
beginning
mission
work
in
a
new
part
of
the
country
where
christians
had
never
been
mary
and
etim
went
to
mary
started
a
school
and
a
small
congregation
etim
was
made
the
teacher
of
the
school
he
proved
to
be
a
very
good
teacher
soon
he
had
a
class
of
fifty
children
it
is
my
hope
said
mary
that
ikotobong
will
be
the
first
of
a
chain
of
stations
stretching
across
the
country
mary
went
to
visit
the
old
chief
of
ikotobong
what
do
you
think
of
our
work
here
it
is
good
said
the
chief
i
am
happy
you
came
there
are
many
things
that
are
strange
to
me
and
my
people
we
do
not
understand
them
i
am
glad
for
the
light
we
will
give
etim
food
as
pay
for
teaching
we
will
help
build
a
schoolhouse
and
a
church
mary
was
happy
that
the
people
were
willing
and
anxious
to
learn
but
she
wanted
to
go
to
a
new
part
of
the
country
and
start
more
places
the
government
officer
at
ikot
expene
gave
mary
a
bicycle
i
think
it
god
will
that
i
learn
to
ride
this
bicycle
think
of
an
old
lady
like
me
on
a
bicycle
said
mary
the
new
road
makes
it
easy
to
ride
and
i
running
up
and
down
and
taking
a
new
work
in
a
village
two
miles
off
it
has
done
me
all
the
good
in
the
world
and
i
will
soon
be
able
to
do
even
more
work
the
treatment
of
the
women
in
ibibio
was
very
bad
they
were
treated
worse
than
slaves
the
men
could
do
whatever
they
wanted
to
do
with
them
they
were
often
beaten
they
were
bought
and
sold
like
cattle
mary
wanted
to
help
the
poor
women
i
want
to
build
a
home
for
girls
orphans
twins
and
their
mothers
and
those
who
have
run
away
from
harems
said
mary
i
also
want
to
start
a
school
where
trades
and
skills
can
be
taught
all
the
women
know
how
to
farm
they
know
how
to
weave
baskets
and
make
simple
sandals
but
i
want
them
to
know
many
more
things
so
that
they
can
take
care
of
themselves
i
am
going
to
look
for
a
place
with
good
land
and
pure
water
near
the
roads
and
the
markets
then
i
will
write
to
my
friends
and
to
the
mission
board
for
help
mary
furlough
had
first
been
for
six
months
and
then
was
made
six
months
longer
in
april
it
came
to
an
end
she
was
supposed
to
go
back
to
akpap
because
the
mission
council
expected
her
to
settle
down
in
one
place
and
work
there
they
appointed
her
to
work
at
akpap
and
that
is
where
they
expected
her
to
work
i
do
not
want
to
settle
in
one
place
said
mary
god
gives
me
different
gifts
i
think
my
gift
is
to
explore
and
start
new
congregations
others
are
better
fitted
to
take
care
of
them
after
they
are
started
than
i
am
god
is
pushing
me
onward
i
do
dare
look
backward
even
if
my
dear
church
turns
against
me
and
will
not
have
me
as
its
missionary
i
must
go
forward
i
can
find
food
for
myself
and
the
children
that
is
all
i
need
god
will
help
me
mary
thought
and
prayed
much
over
this
matter
she
thought
of
starting
a
store
or
taking
a
government
job
so
she
could
earn
money
to
take
care
of
the
missionary
work
she
wrote
a
long
letter
to
the
mission
board
she
told
how
god
had
blessed
the
work
at
itu
and
the
villages
on
enyong
creek
then
she
wrote
in
all
this
how
plainly
god
has
been
leading
me
i
did
not
think
of
doing
these
things
in
my
lifetime
but
god
has
led
me
on
first
itu
and
then
the
creek
then
back
from
aro
where
i
had
set
my
heart
to
a
lonely
spooky
wilderness
there
no
one
ever
went
but
now
miles
of
roads
are
being
built
the
board
says
i
am
to
go
back
to
akpap
in
april
i
love
no
other
place
on
earth
so
well
but
i
dare
not
think
of
leaving
the
crowds
of
untamed
unwashed
unlovely
savages
and
take
away
the
little
sunlight
that
has
begun
to
flicker
out
over
its
darkness
i
know
that
i
am
pretty
old
for
this
kind
of
work
but
god
will
help
whether
the
church
permits
or
not
i
feel
that
i
must
stay
here
i
must
even
go
farther
as
the
roads
are
made
i
can
not
walk
now
and
i
must
be
careful
of
my
health
but
i
can
get
four
wheels
made
and
set
a
box
on
them
and
the
children
can
pull
me
i
dare
not
go
back
if
the
board
insists
i
will
risk
finding
some
other
way
to
support
myself
and
my
family
as
april
drew
closer
day
by
day
mary
anxiously
waited
for
the
mission
board
answer
the
mission
board
wrote
to
mary
we
are
sending
john
rankin
to
look
over
the
field
where
you
have
been
working
after
he
has
made
his
report
we
will
decide
what
you
should
do
rankin
visited
the
different
places
in
cannibal
land
where
mary
had
started
congregations
he
talked
with
the
chiefs
and
the
people
one
chief
talking
about
mary
and
the
other
women
missionaries
said
them
women
be
the
best
men
for
the
mission
he
wrote
to
the
board
close
to
arochuku
within
a
circle
of
less
than
three
miles
in
diameter
there
are
nineteen
large
towns
i
visited
sixteen
of
these
each
of
them
is
larger
than
creek
town
most
of
the
people
are
anxious
to
help
already
many
of
them
have
begun
to
live
in
god
way
even
the
head
chief
of
all
the
aros
wants
us
to
do
mission
work
in
his
country
he
told
the
other
chiefs
he
is
going
to
rule
according
to
god
way
he
wants
missionaries
to
be
sent
to
his
people
he
offers
to
build
a
house
at
arochuku
for
any
missionary
who
will
come
the
mission
board
was
thrilled
when
they
read
this
report
they
agreed
to
give
the
money
for
the
work
which
mary
had
planned
they
appointed
rankin
to
take
charge
of
the
stations
at
itu
and
arochuku
they
agreed
to
let
mary
go
into
the
new
territory
she
did
not
have
to
go
back
to
akpap
this
made
mary
very
happy
now
she
could
work
full
time
among
the
ibibios
she
offered
to
pay
for
the
building
of
a
mission
station
among
the
ibibios
if
there
was
no
money
in
the
homeland
treasury
in
may
the
government
appointed
mary
to
take
charge
of
the
courts
in
the
ibibio
district
as
she
had
done
in
okoyong
it
paid
her
for
this
work
so
now
she
had
money
to
carry
on
her
mission
work
whether
the
board
paid
her
or
not
court
was
held
at
ikotobong
three
chiefs
and
a
jury
helped
mary
in
trying
the
cases
but
mary
word
was
law
mary
was
fair
and
kind
but
at
the
same
time
she
saw
to
it
that
those
who
did
bad
things
were
punished
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
she
wrote
god
help
those
poor
helpless
women
they
are
treated
worse
than
animals
today
i
had
a
crowd
of
people
how
wicked
they
were
i
have
had
a
murder
a
poison
bean
case
a
suicide
a
man
branding
his
slave
wife
all
over
her
face
and
body
a
man
with
a
gun
who
shot
four
people
it
is
all
horrible
but
her
work
as
judge
did
not
stop
her
from
doing
her
mission
work
everywhere
she
went
she
told
the
natives
of
jesus
death
for
them
she
opened
schools
and
churches
for
natives
she
also
was
thinking
about
the
other
missionaries
she
planned
a
place
for
them
where
they
could
spend
weekends
or
where
they
could
rest
when
they
were
getting
over
sickness
she
chose
a
place
between
itu
and
ikotobong
on
enyong
creek
it
was
high
above
the
lowlands
where
most
of
the
sickness
was
a
friend
sent
her
a
check
for
and
mary
used
it
as
a
start
for
this
rest
home
she
had
the
ground
cleared
and
a
small
english
house
built
although
mary
was
busy
she
was
not
well
during
most
of
she
had
been
ailing
if
you
want
to
keep
on
with
your
missionary
work
said
the
government
doctor
you
must
go
home
to
scotland
where
you
can
rest
up
and
get
the
fever
out
of
your
system
mary
did
not
want
to
leave
her
work
a
few
days
after
her
talk
with
the
doctor
when
he
came
to
see
her
again
she
was
much
better
it
looks
as
if
god
wants
me
to
stay
does
that
sound
like
he
could
not
do
without
me
i
do
not
mean
it
so
how
little
i
can
do
but
i
can
at
least
keep
a
door
open
for
missionary
work
so
others
can
come
and
do
more
the
year
came
mary
was
much
worse
she
could
walk
only
a
few
steps
when
she
wanted
to
go
anywhere
she
had
to
be
carried
at
last
she
decided
to
do
as
the
doctor
told
her
and
go
to
scotland
for
a
vacation
oh
the
dear
homeland
she
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
shall
i
really
be
there
and
worship
in
the
churches
again
how
i
long
for
a
look
at
a
winter
landscape
to
feel
the
cold
wind
and
the
frost
in
the
cart
ruts
how
i
want
to
take
a
back
seat
in
a
church
and
hear
the
congregation
singing
without
a
care
of
my
own
i
want
to
hear
how
they
preach
and
pray
and
rest
their
souls
in
the
hush
and
silence
of
our
home
churches
mary
took
her
dan
one
of
the
many
children
she
had
adopted
the
government
officers
were
kind
and
helpful
to
her
in
getting
ready
for
her
trip
god
must
repay
these
men
said
mary
because
i
can
not
he
will
not
forget
that
they
did
it
to
a
child
of
his
unworthy
though
she
is
mary
was
now
a
wrinkled
old
lady
almost
sixty
years
old
she
was
carried
on
board
the
ship
that
would
take
her
to
scotland
her
friends
both
white
and
native
cried
and
wondered
if
she
would
ever
come
back
to
africa
again
send
us
workers
for
dark
africa
said
mary
if
i
can
get
the
board
to
send
us
one
or
more
workers
i
will
give
half
my
salary
to
add
to
theirs
i
will
give
the
house
for
them
to
live
in
and
find
the
servants
you
who
have
so
much
wo
you
do
something
for
these
poor
people
of
africa
mary
was
speaking
in
the
churches
of
scotland
telling
about
her
work
in
africa
after
she
had
returned
to
scotland
she
felt
much
better
the
air
and
climate
was
much
better
than
in
the
steaming
jungles
of
africa
as
soon
as
she
was
strong
enough
she
began
to
go
about
telling
about
her
work
she
urged
the
people
to
give
money
and
to
send
workers
to
africa
above
all
she
wanted
to
get
money
to
support
the
industrial
home
for
women
which
she
had
planned
from
may
until
october
she
went
among
the
churches
telling
about
the
african
sheep
whom
the
good
shepherd
jesus
wanted
brought
in
in
october
mary
asked
to
be
sent
back
to
africa
she
wanted
to
carry
on
her
work
there
i
am
foolish
i
know
said
mary
but
i
just
feel
homeless
without
any
relatives
here
in
scotland
i
am
a
poor
lonesome
soul
with
only
memories
back
in
africa
mary
was
busier
than
ever
holding
court
looking
after
her
home
and
doing
missionary
work
on
sundays
she
held
a
or
more
services
in
the
nearby
villages
in
which
lived
the
people
with
whom
she
worked
during
the
week
on
some
of
these
trips
she
brought
back
orphan
children
to
join
her
already
overstuffed
household
but
all
this
work
was
too
much
for
her
she
became
sick
again
and
very
weak
now
her
eyes
began
to
get
weak
so
that
she
could
not
see
as
well
but
nothing
could
stop
her
she
started
the
building
of
the
industrial
home
for
women
and
girls
she
planted
fruit
trees
there
and
planned
to
raise
rubber
and
cocoa
and
cattle
mary
wanted
to
move
again
some
natives
had
come
from
ikpe
to
see
her
before
she
went
on
her
vacation
to
scotland
they
asked
her
to
bring
the
gospel
to
them
now
they
came
again
we
have
heard
of
the
great
white
mother
and
we
want
to
learn
to
be
men
they
said
mary
made
a
canoe
trip
to
their
town
ikpe
was
a
large
town
with
many
people
in
it
but
the
people
were
very
wicked
they
did
all
the
wicked
heathen
things
that
were
against
god
commandments
but
there
were
people
in
it
who
wanted
to
become
christians
they
had
begun
to
build
a
small
church
building
to
which
they
had
added
two
rooms
for
the
missionary
mary
held
a
service
in
the
church
many
people
had
gathered
to
hear
for
the
first
time
the
news
of
how
jesus
saves
us
after
the
end
of
the
service
mary
decided
that
it
was
god
will
for
her
to
move
to
ikpe
but
she
had
to
arrange
for
someone
to
take
care
of
her
other
work
first
when
she
came
home
from
this
trip
she
was
sick
again
as
soon
as
she
was
a
little
better
she
busied
herself
with
the
women
home
she
wanted
to
get
that
running
well
before
she
left
for
ikpe
the
natives
of
ikpe
sent
some
more
of
their
people
to
visit
her
and
beg
her
to
come
to
ikpe
whenever
she
could
she
made
trips
to
that
village
often
she
took
other
missionaries
with
her
in
november
she
resigned
from
her
court
work
the
government
did
not
like
to
lose
her
because
she
knew
so
much
about
the
natives
and
their
customs
but
the
government
knew
that
mary
first
love
was
her
missionary
work
they
let
her
give
up
her
court
work
and
thanked
her
for
all
she
had
done
just
a
few
more
things
to
take
care
of
said
mary
and
i
will
be
ready
to
start
for
ikpe
those
faithful
people
deserve
a
worker
they
are
holding
services
even
though
they
know
very
little
of
christianity
i
must
go
there
i
know
god
wants
it
it
was
the
year
and
mary
was
sure
that
now
she
could
begin
her
work
in
the
new
territory
that
looked
so
promising
suddenly
mary
became
very
very
ill
the
government
sent
its
official
automobile
to
take
her
to
the
mary
slessor
hospital
at
itu
did
god
want
mary
to
work
at
ikpe
or
would
someone
else
preach
the
gospel
there
for
many
weeks
mary
lay
sick
in
the
hospital
at
itu
at
last
she
was
much
better
you
must
go
to
duke
town
for
a
longer
rest
said
the
doctor
but
doctor
said
mary
i
have
my
work
to
do
i
can
not
spend
my
time
lying
in
bed
if
you
are
unwilling
to
rest
at
duke
town
i
shall
have
to
send
you
to
scotland
on
a
long
vacation
very
well
sighed
mary
i
will
go
to
duke
town
the
next
day
the
government
sent
its
boat
the
maple
leaf
to
take
mary
down
the
river
to
duke
town
here
she
spent
many
weeks
resting
and
gaining
her
strength
at
last
the
doctor
agreed
that
she
could
go
back
to
her
work
at
ikotobong
once
more
the
government
sent
its
boat
to
take
her
back
to
her
mission
station
i
want
to
go
to
ikpe
soon
said
mary
but
first
i
want
to
establish
a
station
at
ikot
expene
and
at
other
places
along
the
way
whenever
she
felt
strong
enough
she
rode
her
bicycle
through
the
jungle
to
ikot
expene
choosing
places
for
schools
and
churches
along
the
way
talking
to
chiefs
and
getting
the
things
ready
for
more
places
where
the
gospel
could
be
preached
the
people
at
ikpe
were
holding
services
even
though
they
knew
very
little
about
christianity
soon
the
white
ma
will
come
they
said
she
will
tell
us
more
about
jesus
a
native
teacher
from
another
station
who
had
received
training
from
mary
taught
the
people
what
he
knew
about
the
gospel
oh
why
can
not
the
church
send
two
workers
to
ikpe
said
mary
why
they
use
the
money
on
hand
for
that
if
there
is
enough
money
left
after
two
years
let
them
take
my
salary
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
live
on
native
food
with
my
children
mary
was
busy
collecting
building
materials
and
other
things
for
the
church
of
ikpe
at
last
the
time
came
god
wanted
mary
at
ikpe
how
happy
mary
was
how
happy
were
the
faithful
people
at
ikpe
who
had
waited
so
long
mary
at
once
was
busy
with
much
work
she
quieted
mobs
she
calmed
quarreling
chiefs
she
held
meetings
with
the
crowds
and
on
sundays
conducted
services
one
day
the
smallpox
broke
out
the
government
sent
down
men
to
vaccinate
the
natives
so
the
sickness
would
not
spread
mary
heard
shouting
and
yelling
in
the
streets
she
looked
out
of
her
house
the
natives
were
yelling
and
shouting
and
waving
guns
and
swords
mary
went
up
to
the
crowd
what
is
this
asked
mary
the
crowd
kept
yelling
be
quiet
shouted
mary
and
held
out
her
hands
let
your
chief
speak
ma
said
the
chief
my
people
are
afraid
of
the
white
man
juju
it
makes
the
people
sick
he
meant
the
vaccination
the
vaccination
may
make
a
little
sickness
but
it
keeps
you
from
getting
the
big
sickness
said
mary
then
she
told
them
how
vaccination
had
helped
other
tribes
she
showed
them
her
vaccination
after
a
long
talk
with
the
chiefs
and
the
people
the
matter
was
peaceably
settled
mary
wanted
to
keep
in
touch
with
her
former
headquarters
at
ikotobong
she
made
many
canoe
trips
back
and
forth
these
trips
were
very
hard
on
her
and
she
did
not
rest
well
many
people
wondered
how
mary
could
keep
on
working
but
she
trusted
god
who
made
her
strong
to
carry
on
during
a
tornado
struck
mary
house
at
use
one
of
the
stations
she
fixed
the
house
herself
during
this
she
strained
herself
and
had
a
heart
attack
which
was
followed
by
a
severe
fever
sometimes
the
fever
was
so
great
she
was
delirious
but
still
she
would
not
stop
working
she
continued
to
teach
school
and
hold
worship
services
on
sunday
hitchcock
of
the
slessor
hospital
came
to
see
her
every
week
you
must
not
go
to
ikpe
again
he
said
you
must
not
ride
your
bicycle
you
must
spend
more
time
resting
but
mary
disobeyed
the
doctor
and
held
services
the
following
sunday
it
was
too
much
for
her
she
almost
fainted
before
the
service
was
over
you
must
stay
in
bed
said
hitchcock
until
you
are
well
enough
to
get
up
all
right
doctor
said
mary
and
you
must
eat
meat
twice
a
day
said
the
doctor
but
i
not
a
answered
mary
you
going
to
be
or
i
will
send
you
to
duke
town
for
a
long
rest
mary
laughed
i
all
my
plans
made
and
i
must
not
draw
a
salary
without
doing
something
for
it
at
last
the
doctor
sent
her
to
the
slessor
hospital
for
a
rest
because
of
her
hard
work
she
had
a
bad
fever
sickness
now
mary
saw
that
she
was
foolish
in
not
listening
to
the
doctor
life
is
hardly
worth
living
she
said
but
i
am
doing
what
i
can
to
help
the
doctor
to
help
me
so
i
can
be
fit
again
for
another
spell
of
work
the
christians
at
ikpe
sent
some
men
to
see
mary
to
ask
her
when
she
would
be
back
seven
weeks
said
hitchcock
i
may
run
up
sooner
than
that
said
mary
i
very
well
if
the
doctor
would
only
believe
it
near
the
end
of
mary
was
allowed
to
leave
the
hospital
she
hurried
to
her
friends
at
ikpe
but
mary
still
was
not
very
strong
her
friends
in
calabar
and
in
scotland
urged
her
to
take
a
furlough
while
thinking
about
this
mary
decided
to
have
a
box
on
wheels
made
so
that
she
could
get
around
since
the
doctor
would
not
let
her
use
her
bicycle
some
friends
heard
about
this
and
they
sent
her
a
light
cart
which
could
be
wheeled
by
two
boys
or
girls
now
i
do
need
a
furlough
said
mary
instead
of
going
home
as
i
had
planned
i
shall
stay
here
and
enjoy
going
over
ground
in
my
cart
that
i
could
get
over
otherwise
a
new
government
road
was
being
built
between
ikpe
and
ikot
expene
mary
wanted
to
start
schools
and
churches
all
along
this
road
but
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
carry
out
her
idea
her
heart
was
very
weak
now
and
she
had
to
rest
often
if
there
had
been
someone
to
take
her
place
she
would
have
gone
home
for
a
rest
mary
wrote
to
a
friend
we
were
never
so
shorthanded
and
i
can
do
what
others
can
not
what
indeed
doctors
would
not
allow
them
to
try
no
one
meddles
with
me
and
i
slip
along
and
do
my
work
using
less
strength
than
many
would
have
to
use
mary
knew
if
she
took
a
furlough
her
work
at
ikpe
and
the
other
stations
would
stop
because
there
was
no
one
to
take
her
place
this
she
did
not
want
to
happen
she
worked
on
through
the
summer
of
in
september
she
completed
years
as
a
missionary
in
africa
i
lame
and
feeble
and
foolish
said
mary
but
i
grip
on
well
her
friends
were
very
much
worried
about
her
health
it
was
suggested
that
she
be
sent
on
an
trip
to
the
canary
islands
there
the
climate
was
milder
than
it
would
have
been
in
scotland
during
the
winter
she
was
glad
to
go
mary
wrote
what
love
is
wrapped
around
me
it
is
simply
wonderful
i
ca
say
anything
else
oh
if
i
only
get
another
day
to
work
i
hope
it
will
be
fuller
of
earnestness
and
blessing
than
the
past
this
vacation
was
a
real
blessing
to
mary
the
fevers
left
her
with
no
committee
meetings
no
court
cases
or
other
problems
to
worry
about
she
grew
stronger
very
quickly
it
was
not
many
months
before
she
was
back
at
duke
town
the
doctor
gave
her
an
examination
you
as
sound
as
an
elephant
ivory
tusk
said
the
doctor
you
are
good
for
many
years
if
you
will
only
take
care
mary
did
not
like
that
she
had
never
been
willing
to
sit
and
twiddle
her
thumbs
now
her
mind
was
full
of
new
plans
for
more
work
she
wanted
to
get
busy
with
her
work
for
the
lord
for
the
next
two
years
mary
worked
hard
at
use
and
ikpe
she
traveled
between
these
two
places
sometimes
in
a
canoe
sometimes
in
the
government
boat
but
mostly
in
her
cart
there
was
still
much
to
do
she
was
still
fighting
the
juju
worship
the
sinful
practice
of
eating
people
and
the
murdering
of
twins
eight
years
had
gone
by
since
mary
had
left
akpap
a
new
church
was
being
finished
and
the
missionaries
who
now
worked
there
invited
mary
to
attend
the
dedication
service
mary
wanted
to
see
the
dear
friends
she
had
loved
for
years
she
decided
to
go
and
take
her
adopted
children
with
her
from
all
over
okoyong
the
people
had
come
to
see
their
ma
their
white
queen
ma
eme
the
missionary
old
friend
was
there
when
they
met
tears
filled
their
eyes
they
were
so
happy
to
see
one
another
again
but
mary
was
sad
too
because
ma
eme
had
never
openly
accepted
christianity
speaking
of
ma
eme
mary
said
my
dear
and
old
friend
and
almost
sister
she
made
the
saving
of
life
so
often
possible
in
the
early
days
it
is
sad
that
she
would
not
come
out
for
christ
she
could
have
been
the
honored
leader
of
god
work
hers
is
a
foolish
choice
and
yet
god
can
not
forget
all
she
was
to
me
and
how
she
helped
me
in
those
dark
and
bloody
days
hundreds
of
people
crowded
into
the
new
church
at
akpap
mary
remembered
the
wild
parties
and
drunken
fights
of
the
first
days
of
her
work
among
the
people
how
they
were
changed
how
god
had
changed
them
through
his
gospel
it
was
wonderful
mary
thanked
god
for
his
wonderful
blessings
shortly
after
her
trip
to
akpap
mary
was
honored
by
the
king
of
great
britain
she
was
chosen
by
him
to
be
a
member
of
the
order
of
john
of
jerusalem
this
was
an
honor
given
only
to
english
christians
who
had
done
great
things
for
god
the
government
people
of
calabar
decided
that
they
must
have
a
public
celebration
of
this
great
honor
they
sent
the
government
boat
for
mary
the
little
old
missionary
now
nearly
was
brought
to
duke
town
here
a
great
crowd
filled
the
biggest
hall
in
town
the
governor
made
a
speech
and
pinned
the
cross
on
mary
left
shoulder
during
the
speech
mary
sat
with
her
head
in
her
hands
when
it
came
time
for
her
to
speak
she
found
it
hard
to
talk
turning
to
the
boys
and
girls
who
were
in
the
hall
she
said
be
faithful
to
the
government
be
christians
be
friends
of
the
mission
and
be
followers
of
jesus
later
she
wrote
to
her
friends
in
scotland
do
think
there
is
any
change
in
me
because
i
received
this
honor
i
am
mary
slessor
nothing
more
and
none
other
than
the
unworthy
unprofitable
but
most
willing
servant
of
the
king
of
kings
the
only
change
the
honor
made
in
mary
was
that
she
worked
harder
than
ever
a
government
road
was
opened
to
odoro
ikpe
mary
at
once
started
a
mission
there
and
reached
out
into
the
small
jungle
settlements
there
she
talked
with
the
chiefs
and
the
natives
at
last
she
won
their
consent
to
build
schools
and
churches
they
gave
her
the
land
to
do
this
now
she
was
beginning
all
over
in
a
new
territory
she
had
the
same
hard
work
the
same
troubles
the
same
heathen
customs
to
fight
but
mary
was
glad
to
do
it
she
thanked
god
for
the
chance
to
bring
the
gospel
to
people
who
had
never
heard
about
it
mary
saw
to
it
that
a
house
was
built
and
then
began
teaching
in
the
school
holding
services
settling
quarrels
winning
souls
for
jesus
in
august
rumors
reached
her
that
europe
was
rushing
into
war
this
made
her
feel
sick
she
knew
that
this
war
would
not
only
bring
suffering
horror
and
death
to
many
of
her
dear
friends
but
it
would
also
hinder
the
work
in
calabar
several
months
went
by
the
mail
came
mary
opened
the
newspaper
there
she
read
the
headlines
russia
declares
war
france
declares
war
england
declares
war
mary
fainted
the
trouble
and
excitement
were
too
much
for
her
for
two
weeks
more
she
carried
on
her
work
but
it
was
too
much
for
her
she
became
weaker
and
weaker
on
sunday
january
she
held
her
usual
church
service
after
the
church
meeting
she
fainted
robertson
arrived
from
the
slessor
hospital
at
itu
he
was
able
to
bring
her
to
but
on
january
she
found
it
almost
impossible
to
talk
her
last
words
were
a
prayer
in
the
african
language
called
efik
o
abasi
sana
mi
yok
said
mary
o
god
release
me
janie
the
first
twin
mary
had
saved
was
now
a
beautiful
black
woman
she
and
other
children
mary
had
saved
and
adopted
were
watching
beside
bed
through
the
night
a
