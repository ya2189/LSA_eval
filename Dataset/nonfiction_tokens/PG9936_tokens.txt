preface
this
volume
which
is
the
second
of
the
woman
institute
library
of
cookery
deals
with
such
essentials
of
diet
as
the
dairy
products
milk
butter
and
cheese
the
protein
food
eggs
and
the
nutrients
vegetables
in
butter
and
parts
and
are
explained
the
place
that
milk
occupies
in
the
diet
its
composition
grades
and
the
dishes
for
which
it
is
used
the
purchase
care
and
use
of
butter
and
butter
substitutes
and
the
characteristics
care
and
varieties
of
both
domestic
and
imported
cheeses
as
well
as
a
number
of
excellent
recipes
for
cheese
dishes
a
luncheon
menu
in
which
a
cheese
dish
is
substituted
for
meat
is
of
interest
in
this
connection
for
it
shows
the
housewife
early
in
her
studies
not
only
how
to
combine
dishes
to
produce
a
balanced
meal
but
also
how
to
make
up
a
menu
in
which
meat
is
not
needed
in
are
discussed
the
nutritive
value
of
eggs
the
ways
in
which
to
select
preserve
cook
and
serve
them
and
how
to
utilize
eggs
so
many
uses
have
eggs
in
the
diet
and
so
nourishing
is
this
food
that
too
much
attention
can
not
be
paid
to
its
preparation
in
this
lesson
also
is
given
a
breakfast
menu
to
afford
practice
in
preparing
several
simple
dishes
usually
served
in
this
meal
in
parts
and
every
variety
of
vegetable
is
discussed
as
to
food
value
preparation
place
in
the
meal
and
proper
methods
of
serving
with
such
a
fund
of
knowledge
the
housewife
will
be
well
equipped
to
give
pleasing
variety
to
her
meals
in
addition
to
the
instruction
in
these
matters
there
are
a
large
number
of
illustrations
which
make
clear
the
important
details
in
every
process
employed
and
in
many
recipes
show
certain
steps
as
well
as
the
finished
result
with
such
detailed
information
it
is
our
desire
that
as
many
of
the
recipes
as
possible
be
tried
for
it
is
only
through
constant
practice
that
the
rules
and
principles
of
cookery
will
become
thoroughly
instilled
in
the
mind
nothing
is
of
more
value
to
the
housewife
than
such
a
knowledge
of
food
and
its
preparation
for
as
every
one
knows
proper
diet
is
the
chief
requisite
of
good
health
to
be
of
the
greatest
assistance

is
the
purpose
of
these
volumes
to
relieve
her
household
tasks
of
much
of
their
drudgery
and
to
help
her
come
to
a
realization
of
the
opportunity
for

that
is
hers
in
no

milk
in
the
diet
as
is
well
understood
milk
is
the
liquid
that
is
secreted
by
the
mammary
glands
of
female
mammals
for
the
nourishment
of
their
young
the
word
milk
as
it
is
commonly
used
however
refers
to
milk
because
such
milk
is
employed
to
a
greater
extent
as
human
food
than
the
milk
from
any
other
animal
cow
milk
in
its
perfectly
fresh
raw
state
is
a
opaque
fluid
called
milk
and
as
is
well
known
possesses
a
distinctly
sweet
taste
and
characteristic
odor
when
such
milk
is
allowed
to
stand
for
some
time
without
being
disturbed
it
separates
into
two
distinct
layers
an
upper
and
a
lower
one
the
upper
layer
which
is
lighter
than
the
lower
one
and
occupies
a
smaller
space
consists
largely
of
globules
of
fat
and
is
called
the
lower
layer
which
is
white
or
in
color
and
is
composed
of
water
solids
and
protein
is
when
separated
from
the
cream
called
as
an
article
of
diet
milk
is
very
important
because
its
sole
function
in
nature
is
to
serve
as
food
it
is
required
by
the
infant
it
is
needed
in
the
diet
of
all
growing
children
and
it
is
desirable
in
the
preparation
of
dishes
for
both
young
and
old
milk
is
used
to
such
a
great
extent
because
it
fills
many
of
the
requirements
of
an
ideal
food
it
is
generally
liked
requires
little
or
no
time
for
preparation
agrees
with
the
majority
of
persons
when
used
properly
and
contains
substances
that
supply
energy
and
build
and
repair
tissue
still
it
does
not
contain
these
substances
in
such
proportions
as
to
make
it
an
ideal
or
exclusive
article
of
diet
for
adults
and
it
must
often
be
modified
to
suit
the
needs
of
infants
because
it
is
ideal
for
only
the
young
of
the
species
for
which
it
is
intended
therefore
while
milk
is
often
called
a
perfect
food
in
reality
it
is
perfect
for
only
the
calf
when
it
is
desired
for
the
feeding
of
a
very
young
child
it
must
be
changed
to
meet
the
requirements
before
it
can
be
used
with
good
results
so
important
is
milk
as
an
article
of
food
that
outside
of
the
purely
rural
districts
producing
the
milk
supply
is
a
business
of
considerable
importance
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
purity
of
milk
must
be
constantly
safeguarded
in
order
that
clean
safe
milk
may
be
provided
for
the
countless
numbers
that
depend
on
it
in
fact
milk
undoubtedly
bears
a
closer
relation
to
public
health
than
any
other
food
to
produce
an
adequate
amount
of
clean
safe
pure
milk
is
one
of
the
food
problems
of
the
city
and
country
alike
in
the
city
much
of
the
difficulty
is
overcome
by
the
ordinances
that
provide
standards
of
composition
and
cleanliness
as
well
as
inspection
to
insure
them
but
such
ordinances
are
rarely
provided
for
in
villages
and
country
districts
when
there
is
no
law
to
prevent
it
unclean
milk
is
sometimes
used
in
the
manufacture
of
butter
and
cheese
but
when
this
happens
great
injustice
if
not
positive
harm
is
done
to
the
consumers
of
these
articles
then
too
unless
milk
is
carefully
inspected
tubercular
milk
is
liable
to
be
used
in
the
making
of
butter
and
such
a
condition
will
cause
the
spreading
of
tuberculosis
as
readily
as
the
use
of
the
contaminated
milk
itself
with
its
various
products
milk
helps
to
form
a
very
large
part
of
the
dietary
in
most
homes
but
while
nothing
can
take
the
place
of
this
food
and
while
it
is
high
in
food
value
there
seems
to
be
a
general
tendency
to
think
of
it
as
an
addition
to
the
bill
of
fare
rather
than
as
a
possible
substitute
for
more
expensive
food
for
instance
milk
is
very
often
served
as
a
beverage
in
a
meal
in
which
the
quantity
of
meat
or
other
protein
foods
is
not
reduced
from
an
economical
standpoint
as
well
as
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
needs
of
the
body
this
is
really
extravagant
for
milk
is
itself
largely
a
protein
food
the
serving
of
a
glass
of
milk
or
of
a
dish
that
contains
generous
quantities
of
milk
offers
the
housewife
an
opportunity
to
cut
down
considerably
the
allowance
of
meat
and
eggs
because
of
this
fact
and
because
milk
and
its
products
may
be
used
to
add
nutritive
value
to
a
food
to
give
variety
and
to
improve
flavor
they
deserve
considerable
study
on
the
part
of
the
housewife
since
milk
may
be
used
in
such
a
variety
of
ways
it
may
be
easily
included
in
the
dietary
for
the
family
being
liquid
in
form
it
may
always
be
served
without
any
preparation
as
a
beverage
or
with
other
beverages
cereals
and
fruits
it
also
has
numerous
other
uses
being
employed
in
the
making
of
sauces
for
vegetables
and
meats
in
the
place
of
stock
for
soups
and
as
the
liquid
for
bread
cakes
puddings
custards
and
many
frozen
desserts
because
of
its
extensive
use
every
housewife
not
only
should
know
how
to
buy
milk
and
care
for
it
but
should
be
familiar
with
its
composition
so
that
she
may
determine
whether
or
not
it
suits
the
needs
of
her
family
in
addition
she
should
know
the
effect
of
heat
on
milk
and
the
various
methods
of
preparation
if
she
would
be
able
to
judge
what
food
combinations
can
be
used
with
milk
composition
of
milk
as
milk
is
usually
taken
into
the
body
in
liquid
form
the
common
tendency
is
to
regard
it
as
a
beverage
rather
than
as
an
important
source
of
nourishing
food
material
however
a
knowledge
of
its
composition
as
well
as
the
fact
that
milk
becomes
a
solid
food
in
the
stomach
and
must
then
be
dissolved
in
the
process
of
digestion
will
serve
to
show
that
milk
contains
solids
that
it
possesses
all
the
elements
required
to
sustain
life
and
promote
health
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
a
child
may
live
for
months
on
milk
alone
and
during
this
time
increase
in
weight
the
solids
contained
in
milk
are
proteins
fat
carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
sugar
and
mineral
salts
besides
which
of
course
water
occurs
in
large
quantities
the
sugar
and
fat
of
milk
serve
as
fuel
the
mineral
salts
are
chiefly
valuable
for
the
growth
of
bones
and
teeth
and
for
their
effect
on
the
liquids
of
the
body
and
the
proteins
like
the
fat
and
sugar
serve
as
fuel
but
they
also
make
and
repair
the
muscular
tissues
of
the
body
in
considering
the
food
substances
of
milk
it
will
be
well
to
note
also
that
they
vary
according
to
the
breed
feeding
and
individual
characteristics
of
the
cow
jerseys
and
guernseys
give
milk
rich
in
fat
and
total
solids
and
while
holstein
cows
give
a
greater
quantity
of
milk
such
milk
has
a
smaller
proportion
of
fat
and
total
solids
as
a
rule
though
the
composition
of
milk
may
be
considered
as
approximately
per
cent
protein
per
cent
fat
per
cent
carbohydrate
and
per
cent
mineral
matter
making
a
total
of
per
cent
this
indicates
the
quantity
of
actual
food
material
in
milk
the
remainder
or
per
being
water
protein
in
because
of
the
double
usefulness
of
protein
to
serve
as
fuel
and
to
make
and
repair
muscular
tissue
this
element
is
regarded
as
an
important
ingredient
of
milk
the
protein
in
milk
is
called
the
opaque
whiteness
of
milk
is
largely
due
to
the
presence
of
this
substance
as
long
as
milk
remains
sweet
the
lime
salts
it
contains
hold
this
casein
in
solution
but
when
it
sours
the
salts
are
made
soluble
and
the
casein
thickens
or
coagulates
in
addition
to
casein
milk
contains
a
small
amount
of
protein
in
the
form
of
this
substance
upon
being
heated
coagulates
and
causes
the
formation
of
the
skin
that
is
always
found
on
the
top
of
milk
that
has
been
heated
the
skin
thus
formed
contains
everything
that
is
found
in
milk
because
as
it
forms
casein
is
dried
with
it
and
sugar
and
fat
too
are
caught
and
held
there
it
is
the
protein
of
milk
and
its
characteristic
coagulation
that
are
made
use
of
in
the
making
of
cheese
in
cooking
the
protein
of
milk
is
probably
more
affected
than
any
of
the
other
substances
but
the
degree
to
which
the
digestion
of
milk
is
thus
affected
is
not
definitely
known
this
being
a
much
disputed
question
fat
in
the
other
substance
in
milk
that
serves
as
fuel
or
to
produce
energy
is
fat
it
occurs
in
the
form
of
tiny
particles
each
surrounded
by
a
thin
covering
and
suspended
in
the
liquid
such
a
mixture
which
is
called
an
is
the
most
easily
digested
form
in
which
fat
is
found
the
fat
in
milk
varies
more
than
the
other
food
substances
it
being
sometimes
as
low
as
per
cent
and
again
as
high
as
per
cent
however
the
average
of
these
two
or
per
is
the
usual
amount
found
in
most
milk
as
has
been
mentioned
the
fat
globules
of
milk
rise
to
the
top
because
fat
is
lighter
than
water
so
that
when
milk
has
been
undisturbed
for
some
time
the
top
which
is
known
as
will
be
found
to
contain
most
of
the
fat
because
of
the
fat
it
contains
the
cream
is
yellower
in
color
than
the
milk
underneath
if
the
cream
is
beaten
or
churned
these
fat
particles
will
adhere
in
a
mass
advantage
of
this
fact
being
taken
in
the
making
of
butter
carbohydrate
in
the
carbohydrate
contained
in
milk
is
in
the
form
of
sugar
called
it
is
unlike
other
sugars
in
that
it
is
not
very
sweet
and
does
not
disagree
with
most
persons
nor
upset
their
digestion
for
this
reason
it
is
often
given
to
children
invalids
and
persons
who
have
digestive
disturbances
however
it
is
like
other
carbohydrates
in
that
in
solution
it
ferments
the
result
of
the
fermentation
in
this
case
is
the
production
of
which
makes
the
milk
sour
with
the
fat
lactose
makes
up
the
bulk
of
the
material
of
milk
and
while
this
is
important
it
is
only
secondary
when
compared
to
the
power
of
the
protein
and
minerals
besides
being
an
important
part
of
milk
itself
lactose
is
a
valuable
in
the
manufacture
of
cheese
after
being
taken
from
which
is
the
clear
liquid
that
remains
when
the
curd
or
coagulated
portion
is
completely
removed
from
the
milk
the
lactose
is
refined
and
sold
in
the
form
of
a
powder
that
is
used
for
various
kinds
of
infant
and
invalid
feeding
mineral
matter
in
considerable
quantities
of
mineral
salts
which
are
chiefly
and
are
found
in
milk
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
these
are
important
in
the
building
of
bone
and
hard
tissue
in
the
body
but
in
addition
they
help
to
keep
the
fluids
of
the
body
in
the
right
condition
because
of
the
work
they
do
these
mineral
salts
are
necessary
in
the
building
of
the
bodies
of
growing
children
and
are
useful
for
repair
and
the
regulation
of
the
body
processes
in
adults
in
cheese
butter
and
cream
which
are
the
products
of
milk
less
of
the
mineral
salts
are
found
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
than
in
whole
milk
skim
milk
and
whey
water
in
the
percentage
of
water
in
milk
is
much
greater
than
that
of
all
the
other
food
substances
combined
there
being
more
than
six
times
as
much
while
this
quantity
seems
very
large
it
is
an
advantage
for
milk
provides
nourishment
to
persons
when
they
can
take
neither
solid
nor
more
condensed
food
on
the
other
hand
the
water
is
a
disadvantage
for
it
is
responsible
for
the
rapid
spoiling
of
milk
this
fact
is
clearly
shown
in
the
case
of
condensed
milk
where
the
water
is
partly
or
completely
evaporated
for
milk
of
this
kind
keeps
much

products
obtained
from
milk
although
milk
is
used
extensively
in
its
natural
liquid
form
considerable
use
is
also
made
of
the
numerous
products
of
milk
chief
among
which
are
cream
skim
milk
buttermilk
sour
milk
whey
butter
and
cheese
in
fact
all
of
these
occupy
such
an
important
place
in
the
dietary
of
the
majority
of
homes
that
it
is
well
for
every
housewife
to
understand
their
value
butter
and
cheese
are
discussed
in
detail
later
so
that
at
this
time
no
attention
need
be
given
to
them
the
other
products
however
are
taken
up
now
with
the
intention
of
enabling
the
housewife
to
familiarize
herself
with
their
production
nature
and
use
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
particles
of
fat
that
rise
to
the
top
of
milk
when
it
is
allowed
to
remain
undisturbed
for
some
time
form
the
product
known
as
cream
cream
may
be
removed
from
the
milk
by
skimming
it
off
or
it
may
be
separated
from
the
milk
by
means
of
machinery
especially
designed
for
the
purpose
the
greater
the
proportion
of
fat
in
milk
the
thicker
or
heavier
will
be
the
cream
various
grades
of
separated
cream
are
placed
on
the
market
the
usual
ones
being
those
which
contain
and
per
cent
of
fat
thin
cream
which
includes
the
grades
that
have
only
a
small
percentage
of
fat
contains
a
larger
quantity
of
milk
than
the
others
and
is
not
so
desirable
for
many
purposes
still
it
is
used
to
some
extent
because
it
is
cheaper
and
there
are
definite
uses
to
which
it
can
be
put
cream
is
the
kind
to
select
when
it
is
desired
for
this
is
a
process
that
consists
in
beating
the
cream
rapidly
until
a
mass
of
tiny
bubbles
form
and
become
stiff
very
much
as
the
white
of
egg
does
skim
after
a
part
or
all
of
the
cream
has
been
removed
from
whole
milk
that
which
remains
is
called
skim
milk
while
practically
all
of
the
fat
is
taken
out
when
milk
is
skimmed
very
little
protein
or
sugar
is
removed
therefore
skim
milk
is
still
a
valuable
food
it
being
used
to
a
large
extent
for
cheese
making
for
the
manufacture
of
certain
commercial
foods
and
for
the
feeding
of
animals
the
housewife
does
not
as
a
rule
buy
skim
milk
indeed
in
some
localities
the
laws
prevent
its
sale
because
it
is
considered
an
adulterated
food
however
it
is
really
a
wholesome
valuable
food
that
is
cheaper
than
whole
milk
and
its
use
in
the
home
should
therefore
be
encouraged
from
an
economical
standpoint
here
it
may
be
used
in
the
preparation
of
many
dishes
such
as
sauces
cakes
biscuits
muffins
griddle
cakes
bread
in
which
butter
or
other
fats
are
used
and
in
custards
puddings
ices
and
numerous
other
desserts
the
milk
that
remains
in
butter
making
after
the
butter
fat
has
been
removed
from
cream
by
churning
is
known
by
the
name
buttermilk
such
milk
is
similar
to
skim
milk
in
composition
and
unless
butter
is
made
of
sweet
cream
buttermilk
is
sour
buttermilk
is
used
considerably
as
a
beverage
but
besides
this
use
there
are
numerous
ways
in
which
it
may
be
employed
in
the
preparation
of
foods
as
is
pointed
out
in
various
recipes
an
advantage
of
buttermilk
is
that
its
cost
is
less
than
that
of
whole
milk
so
that
the
housewife
will
do
well
to
make
use
of
it
in
the
preparation
of
those
foods
in
which
it
produces
satisfactory
results
artificial
several
kinds
of
sour
milk
that
are
called
buttermilk
are
to
be
had
particularly
at
soda
fountains
and
restaurants
while
they
are
similar
to
buttermilk
they
are
not
the
same
because
they
are
produced
artificially
from
whole
or
skimmed
sweet
milk
the
usual
method
employed
in
the
making
of
these
artificial
buttermilks
as
they
may
well
be
called
consists
in
adding
to
sweet
milk
tablets
containing
lactic
acid
or
a
certain
culture
of
bacteria
that
induce
fermentation
very
much
as
yeast
does
and
then
keeping
it
at
about
body
temperature
for
a
number
of
hours
in
order
to
allow
the
milk
to
thicken
and
sour
such
milks
exert
a
beneficial
action
in
the
digestive
tract
and
their
food
value
provided
they
are
made
from
whole
milk
is
just
as
high
as
that
of
the
original
sweet
milk
artificial
buttermilks
therefore
prove
a
valuable
source
of
food
supply
for
persons
who
find
them
palatable
and
who
do
not
care
for
sweet
milk
their
food
value
may
be
increased
by
adding
cream
to
them
sour
ordinary
milk
contains
large
numbers
of
bacteria
that
produce
fermentation
when
it
is
allowed
to
stand
for
some
time
these
bacteria
act
upon
the
sugar
or
lactose
contained
in
the
milk
and
change
it
into
lactic
acid
this
acid
gives
to
the
milk
a
sour
taste
and
at
the
same
time
causes
the
casein
of
the
milk
to
become
a
mass
known
as
or
this
mass
continues
to
grow
sour
and
tough
until
all
the
milk
sugar
is
converted
into
lactic
acid
so
that
the
longer
the
milk
stands
the
more
acid
it
becomes
sour
milk
however
is
useful
in
the
preparation
of
various
dishes
such
as
hot
breads
and
griddle
cakes

housewives
as

fully
appreciate

that
is
to

found
in
whole
milk
and
cream
but
such
products
as
skim
milk
buttermilk
and
whey
are
likely
to
be
ignored
characteristics
of
wholesome
milk
so
far
as
the
housewife
is
concerned
the
qualities
that
characterize
wholesome
milk
are
without
doubt
of
great
interest
she
may
know
of
what
use
milk
is
in
the
diet
and
the
food
substances
of
which
it
is
composed
but
unless
she
understands
just
what
constitutes
milk
of
good
quality
as
well
as
the
nature
of
inferior
milk
she
can
not
very
well
provide
her
family
with
the
kind
it
should
have
therefore
to
assist
her
in
this
matter
the
characteristics
of
wholesome
milk
are
here
discussed
such
milk
it
will
be
well
to
note
must
be
of
the
right
composition
must
not
be
adulterated
must
be
fresh
that
is
not
older
when
delivered
than
is
permitted
by
law
and
must
be
as
clean
as
possible
standard
of
milk
the
housewife
usually
judges
the
quality
of
milk
by
the
amount
of
cream
that
rises
to
the
top
when
milk
in
a
bottle
is
allowed
to
remain
undisturbed
for
some
time
this
is
really
an
excellent
test
because
milk
that
contains
only
a
small
amount
of
cream
is
of
poorer
quality
than
that
which
contains
a
larger
amount
in
other
words
the
more
cream
milk
contains
the
higher
will
be
its
food
value
and
the
greater
its
ability
then
too
milk
that
is
rich
in
cream
usually
contains
proportionately
large
amounts
of
protein
and
sugar
while
the
composition
of
milk
has
much
to
do
with
the
quality
of
this
food
it
varies
as
should
be
noted
in
different
breeds
and
even
in
individual
cows
depending
on
both
the
food
and
the
care
given
to
them
for
this
reason
milk
that
is
mixed
is
preferable
to
the
milk
of
a
single
cow
as
the
mixing
of
the
milk
of
a
number
of
cows
insures
a
better
average
composition
adulteration
of
the
composition
of
milk
and
hence
its
quality
is
seriously
affected
by
its
adulteration
by
this
is
meant
the
extraction
of
any
of
the
food
substances
from
whole
milk
the
addition
of
anything
that
tends
to
weaken
or
lower
its
quality
or
strength
the
use
of
coloring
matter
to
make
it
appear
of
greater
value
than
it
actually
is
or
the
use
of
preservatives
to
prevent
it
from
souring
as
soon
as
it
ordinarily
would
it
is
of
course
illegal
to
adulterate
milk
yet
it
is
sometimes
done
the
most
convenient
and
possibly
the
most
common
materials
used
to
adulterate
milk
are
water
and
skim
milk
the
addition
of
water
to
milk
decreases
the
quantity
of
all
its
food
substances
but
the
addition
of
skim
milk
reduces
the
quantity
of
fat
only
the
color
of
the
milk
is
often
affected
by
the
use
of
these
adulterants
but
when
this
happens
yellow
coloring
is
usually
added
to
restore
the
original
appearance
sometimes
the
milk
that
a
dairyman
markets
contains
more
fat
than
the
law
requires
but
even
such
milk
can
not
legally
be
skimmed
nor
diluted
with
skim
milk
the
only
thing
that
may
be
done
to
it
is
to
mix
it
with
milk
that
is
low
in
butter
fat
and
thus
obtain
a
milk
that
will
average
the
legal
percentage
for
instance
if
milk
from
a
dairy
averages
per
cent
of
butter
fat
it
may
be
diluted
with
milk
that
contains
only
per
cent
of
butter
fat
because
the
result
of
such
mixing
which
will
be
milk
averaging
per
cent
of
this
food
substance
will
be
the
legal
standard
to
prevent
milk
from
souring
dishonest
milk
dealers
often
put
into
it
such
preservatives
as
soda
borax
and
formaldehyde
there
is
no
definite
way
of
telling
whether
or
not
one
of
these
has
been
used
except
by
a
chemical
analysis
however
if
milk
does
not
sour
within
a
reasonable
time
when
no
precautions
have
been
taken
to
keep
it
sweet
it
should
be
looked
on
with
suspicion
for
it
undoubtedly
contains
a
preservative
freshness
of
to
be
most
satisfactory
for
all
purposes
milk
should
be
absolutely
fresh
however
it
is
almost
impossible
to
obtain
milk
in
this
condition
because
it
is
generally
sold
at
a
distance
from
the
source
of
supply
milk
that
is
sold
in
small
towns
and
cities
is
usually
and
often
to
hours
old
when
it
is
delivered
whereas
in
large
cities
where
the
demand
is
so
great
that
milk
must
be
shipped
from
great
distances
it
is
often
to
or
even
hours
old
when
it
reaches
the
consumer
in
order
that
milk
may
remain
sweet
long
enough
to
permit
it
to
be
delivered
at
places
so
far
removed
from
the
source
of
supply
it
must
be
handled
and
cared
for
in
the
cleanest
possible
way
by
the
dealers
likewise
if
the
housewife
desires
to
get
the
best
results
from
it
she
must
follow
the
same
plan
cooling
it
immediately
on
delivery
and
keeping
it
cool
until
it
is
consumed
the
freshness
of
milk
can
be
determined
only
by
the
length
of
time
it
will
remain
sweet
when
proper
care
is
given
to
it
cleanliness
of
milk
may
be
of
the
right
composition
free
from
all
adulteration
and
as
fresh
as
it
is
possible
to
obtain
it
but
unless
it
is
clean
it
is
an
injurious
food
milk
is
rendered
unclean
or
impure
by
dirt
in
reality
there
are
two
kinds
of
dirt
that
may
be
present
in
milk
and
it
is
important
to
know
just
what
these
are
and
what
effect
they
have
on
milk
the
less
harmful
of
the
two
kinds
of
dirt
is
the
visible
dirt
that
gets
into
the
milk
from
the
cow
the
stable
the
milker
the
milking
utensils
and
similar
sources
when
these
are
not
scrupulously
clean
if
milk
containing
such
dirt
is
allowed
to
stand
long
enough
in
pans
or
bottles
for
the
heavier
particles
to
settle
it
will
be
found
as
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
receptacle
to
say
the
least
the
presence
of
such
dirt
is
always
disagreeable
and
frequently
produces
foreign
flavors
straining
the
milk
through
clean
absorbent
cotton
will
reveal
the
presence
of
such
dirt
and
another
kind
of
dirt
that
does
not
show
through
the
opaque
fluid
this
second
kind
of
dirt
is
generally
found
in
milk
when
the
first
kind
is
present
in
any
quantity
it
is
more
liable
to
be
harmful
than
the
other
because
it
enters
the
milk
from
the
water
used
in
cleaning
the
receptacles
or
from
some
contaminated
source
illustration
fig
whenever
dirt
is
present
in
milk
bacteria
are
sure
to
be
there
and
the
greater
the
quantity
of
dirt
the
greater
will
be
the
number
of
bacteria
should
the
housewife
desire
to
compare
the
cleanliness
of
several
lots
of
milk
she
may
filter
a
like
quantity
from
each
lot
say
a
quart
or
a
pint
through
small
disks
of
absorbent
cotton
if
after
the
milk
has
passed
through
the
cotton
disk
very
little
dirt
remains
on
it
as
in
fig
the
milk
may
be
considered
as
comparatively
clean
if
the
cotton
disk
appears
as
in
the
milk
may
be
said
to
be
only
slightly
dirty
if
it
appears
as
in
the
milk
is
dirty
and
if
it
appears
as
in
the
milk
is
very
dirty
milk
that
leaves
a
stain
like
that
in
contains
more
bacteria
than
milk
that
leaves
a
stain
like
that
in
and
so
on
through
all
the
lots
of
milk
filtering
milk
in
this
manner
however
does
not
indicate
whether
the
bacteria
are
disease
producing
such
information
can
be
secured
only
by
microscopic
examination
and
only
then
by
persons
who
have
a
knowledge
of
such
matters
since
as
has
been
pointed
out
bacteria
cling
to
all
dirt
the
dirt
that
milk
contains
is
one
of
the
causes
of
souring
and
putrefaction
of
milk
and
may
be
a
cause
of
disease
indeed
it
is
definitely
known
that
dirty
milk
sours
much
more
quickly
than
does
clean
milk
actual
tests
in
which
clean
milk
was
put
in
a
cool
place
have
proved
that
it
will
keep
for
weeks
whereas
dirty
milk
will
sour
in
a
day
or
two
especially
in
warm
weather
this
information
should
point
out
clearly
to
the
housewife
that
it
is
not
merely
heat
that
changes
milk
or
causes
it
to
sour
she
should
understand
in
addition
that
bacteria
grow
and
multiply
very
rapidly
when
conditions
for
their
growth
are
provided
these
conditions
are
moisture
warmth
and
the
right
kind
of
food
and
as
all
of
these
are
found
in
milk
this
product
is
really
ideal
for
bacterial
development
the
only
way
in
which
to
protect
milk
is
to
make
sure
that
no
bacteria
enter
it
or
if
they
do
to
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
grow
this
may
be
done
by
keeping
the
milk
so
cold
that
they
can
not
thrive
or
by
destroying
them
in
various
ways
which
are
taken
up
later
in
former
times
there
was
not
much
danger
of
disease
from
the
milk
supply
for
it
was
cared
for
almost
entirely
by
those
who
kept
a
few
cows
and
distributed
milk
to
a
small
number
of
customers
in
fact
it
has
been
only
within
the
past
years
that
large
quantities
of
milk
are
handled
by
separate
dairies
and
shipped
great
distances
from
the
source
of
supply
and
that
the
distribution
of
milk
has
become
a
great
industry
when
so
much
milk
is
handled
in
one
place
it
is
more
or
less
unsafe
unless
the
dairy
is
kept
extremely
clean
and
is
conducted
in
the
most
sanitary
manner
experience
has
shown
that
too
much
attention
can
not
be
given
to
the
care
of
milk
for
the
lives
of
great
numbers
of
children
have
been
sacrificed
through
the
carelessness
of
dairymen
and
persons
selling
and
distributing
milk
as
well
as
through
the
negligence
of
those
who
handle
the
milk
after
it
has
entered
the
home
to
overcome
much
of
this
carelessness
both
the
federal
government
and
the
various
states
of
this
country
have
set
standards
for
safe
milk
production
and
in
order
to
make
their
laws
effective
have
established
inspection
service
independently
of
these
state
and
national
laws
many
of
the
cities
particularly
the
large
ones
have
made
their
own
standards
which
as
a
rule
are
very
rigid
one
of
the
usual
requirements
is
to
compel
each
person
who
wishes
to
sell
milk
in
the
city
to
buy
a
license
so
that
the
city
authorities
may
keep
in
touch
with
those
handling
milk
and
so
that
conditions
may
be
investigated
at
any
time
in
view
of
the
care
required
of
dealers
in
handling
milk
the
housewife
owes
it
to
herself
and
the
members
of
her
family
to
keep
the
milk
in
the
home
in
the
best
possible
manner
grades
of
clean
milk
ever
since
milk
has
come
to
be
a
commercial
product
authorities
have
been
devising
ways
in
which
it
may
be
brought
to
the
consumer
in
a
condition
that
will
permit
it
to
be
used
without
causing
ill
results
their
efforts
have
been
rewarded
to
such
an
extent
that
nowadays
consumers
have
little
to
fear
from
the
milk
they
purchase
provided
they
get
it
from
dealers
who
live
up
to
the
laws
chief
among
the
different
grades
of
clean
milk
is
milk
and
next
in
order
comes
milk
followed
by
certified
the
grade
of
clean
milk
sold
under
the
name
of
certified
milk
is
simply
natural
raw
milk
that
is
produced
and
marketed
under
conditions
that
permit
it
to
be
guaranteed
as
pure
wholesome
and
of
definite
composition
such
milk
is
necessarily
higher
in
price
than
milk
that
is
less
wholesome
and
sanitary
because
of
the
extra
cost
to
the
dairyman
in
meeting
the
requirements
that
make
it
possible
for
him
to
produce
clean
milk
under
sanitary
conditions
these
requirements
pertain
to
the
health
and
cleanliness
of
those
who
handle
the
milk
to
the
health
housing
condition
and
care
of
the
herd
and
the
dairy
cows
and
to
the
handling
and
care
of
milk
in
the
dairy
and
during
transportation
and
delivery
they
are
usually
established
and
enforced
by
an
inspection
commission
appointed
by
the
city
county
or
state
in
which
the
milk
is
produced
if
a
little
careful
thought
is
given
to
the
milk
situation
it
will
be
admitted
that
such
precautions
are
necessary
if
clean
milk
is
to
be
the
result
such
milk
can
not
be
produced
if
the
surroundings
are
dirty
because
dust
and
flies
which
are
two
sources
of
contamination
are
practically
always
present
in
such
places
a
stable
with
poor
ventilation
without
screens
to
keep
out
flies
and
with
floors
that
will
not
permit
of
cleaning
but
cause
filth
and
refuse
to
accumulate
is
sure
to
contaminate
milk
that
is
handled
in
it
in
addition
cows
that
are
not
well
fed
comfortably
housed
or
carefully
groomed
can
not
be
expected
to
give
milk
of
as
good
quality
as
cows
that
are
properly
cared
for
likewise
if
the
persons
who
do
the
milking
are
not
clean
the
milk
is
subject
to
contamination
from
this
source
all
such
unfavorable
conditions
can
be
remedied
and
must
be
in
the
production
of
certified
milk
but
the
good
accomplished
in
this
direction
will
be
lost
if
the
milk
is
carelessly
handled
after
milking
therefore
in
producing
certified
milk
only
the
cleanest
water
available
is
allowed
to
be
used
in
the
dairy
impure
water
is
a
common
source
of
the
contamination
of
milk
in
such
places
on
some
farms
the
water
supply
comes
from
a
well
that
is
too
near
the
barn
or
that
is
too
shallow
to
avoid
being
made
impure
by
the
germs
that
filter
into
it
from
the
barnyard
or
a
cesspool
if
vessels
in
which
milk
is
placed
are
washed
in
such
water
it
is
necessary
to
sterilize
them
by
boiling
or
steaming
before
milk
is
put
into
them
in
order
to
kill
the
germs
that
come
from
the
water
if
such
a
precaution
as
this
is
not
observed
the
germs
will
multiply
rapidly
in
the
milk
and
provided
they
are
will
make
the
milk
extremely
dangerous
besides
observing
the
precautions
mentioned
it
is
necessary
that
all
utensils
used
in
a
dairy
such
as
pails
for
milking
strainers
containers
be
kept
scrupulously
clean
likewise
they
must
be
sterilized
by
boiling
each
time
they
are
used
for
while
disease
germs
may
be
absent
those
which
cause
the
milk
to
sour
are
always
present
and
must
be
destroyed
finally
to
prevent
any
germs
that
enter
milk
from
multiplying
even
when
it
is
properly
cared
for
the
milk
has
to
be
cooled
to
a
temperature
of
degrees
fahrenheit
or
lower
immediately
after
milking
and
then
bottled
in
sterilized
bottles
sealed
and
packed
in
ice
within
minutes
after
milking
it
is
by
giving
attention
to
all
such
matters
that
certified
milk
is
possible
such
milk
as
will
be
understood
from
what
has
been
said
is
neither
a
cooked
milk
nor
a
dirty
milk
that
is
processed
but
a
natural
raw
milk
that
is
clean
at
all
stages
of
its
production
and
marketing
because
of
this
fact
it
is
the
best
and
cleanest
milk
to
be
had
and
may
be
used
without
hesitation
not
only
by
grown
persons
in
good
health
but
for
infants
and
invalids
the
sanitary
condition
of
certified
milk
and
the
consequent
length
of
time
it
will
remain
sweet
was
demonstrated
conclusively
as
far
back
as
at
the
paris
exposition
at
this
time
two
model
dairies
in
the
united
states
one
located
at
the
university
of
illinois
and
the
other
at
briarcliff
manor
westchester
county
new
york
delivered
to
their
booths
at
the
exposition
milk
that
was
bottled
under
the
most
sanitary
conditions
at
their
dairies
during
its
transit
across
the
ocean
the
milk
was
kept
at
a
temperature
of
to
degrees
fahrenheit
and
on
its
arrival
weeks
after
leaving
the
dairies
it
was
found
to
be
in
a
perfectly
sweet
condition
similar
experiments
made
at
later
dates
such
as
shipping
certified
milk
from
the
east
to
california
serve
to
bear
out
the
test
made
in
and
prove
what
can
be
done
with
milk
so
produced
as
to
be
as
free
as
possible
from
bacteria
or
the
conditions
that
permit
their
growth
pasteurized
while
certified
milk
is
undoubtedly
the
safest
kind
of
milk
to
use
and
is
constantly
growing
in
favor
much
of
the
milk
received
in
the
home
is
pasteurized
by
pasteurized
milk
is
meant
milk
that
has
been
heated
to
a
temperature
of
to
degrees
fahrenheit
kept
at
this
temperature
for
to
minutes
and
then
cooled
rapidly
the
result
of
such
a
treatment
is
that
any
germs
that
are
present
in
the
milk
as
well
as
those
which
are
likely
to
cause
intestinal
disturbances
are
destroyed
and
that
the
milk
is
rendered
safe
as
food
for
a
time
pasteurizing
does
not
materially
change
the
taste
of
milk
nor
does
it
seriously
affect
the
digestive
properties
of
this
food
it
is
true
of
course
that
pasteurized
milk
is
not
so
good
as
clean
raw
milk
still
it
is
better
to
use
such
milk
than
to
run
the
risk
of
using
milk
that
might
be
contaminated
with
the
germs
of
tuberculosis
typhoid
fever
scarlet
fever
diphtheria
or
any
other
of
the
numerous
diseases
that
have
been
known
to
be
carried
to
whole
families
and
communities
through
the
milk
supply
although
pasteurizing
is
done
on
a
large
scale
in
dairies
there
is
no
reason
why
the
housewife
can
not
pasteurize
the
milk
she
buys
provided
it
is
raw
milk
and
she
feels
that
it
is
not
safe
to
use
if
pasteurizing
is
to
be
done
frequently
and
large
quantities
of
milk
are
to
be
treated
it
would
be
advisable
to
purchase
the
convenient
apparatus
that
is
to
be
had
however
if
only
a
small
quantity
of
milk
is
to
be
pasteurized
at
a
time
a
simple
improvised
outfit
will
prove
satisfactory
because
milk
pasteurized
in
the
home
may
be
heated
in
the
bottles
in
which
it
is
received
such
an
outfit
consists
of
a
dairy
thermometer
a
deep
vessel
and
a
perforated
pie

or
a
wire
rack
of
suitable
size

pasteurize

heat
it

this
temperature
for

minutes

the

soon
as
it
is
taken
from
the

cool
it
as
rapidly
as
possible
by
running
cold

by
placing
the

several
changes
of

when
the
milk
has

this
precaution
is
necessary
because
of
the
nature
of
pasteurized
milk
the
temperature
at
which
milk
is
pasteurized
is
sufficient
to
kill
all
fully
developed
bacteria
but
those
which
exist
in
an
undeveloped
state
or
in
the
form
of
spores
develop
very
rapidly
after
pasteurization
unless
the
milk
is
kept
cold
and
clean
if
these
bacteria
were
allowed
to
develop
the
purpose
of
pasteurization
would
be
lost
and
the
milk
would
become
as
dangerous
as
it
was
originally
the
advantage
of
cooling
milk
rapidly
will
be
fully
appreciated
upon
referring
to
fig
which

milk
in
which
all

by
sterilization
such
milk
is
not
sold
by
dealers
but
the
process
of
sterilization
is
resorted
to
in
the
home
when
pasteurization
is
not
sufficient
to
render
milk
safe
this
process
which
is
the
only
positive
means
of
destroying
all
germs
consists
in
bringing
the
milk
to
the
boiling
point
or
degrees
fahrenheit
allowing
it
to
boil
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
and
then
cooling
it
rapidly
one
who
undertakes
to
treat
milk
in
this
way
should
remember
that
it
is
difficult
to
boil
milk
because
the
solids
in
the
milk
adhere
to
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
vessel
and
soon
burn
however
this
difficulty
can
be
overcome
by
sterilizing
the
milk
in
the
bottles
in
which
it
is
bought
to
sterilize
milk
place
the
sealed
bottles
on
a
wire
rack
or
a
perforated
pie
tin
in
a
deep
vessel
as
for
the
pasteurizing
of
milk
and
pour
cold
water
into
the
vessel
until
it
nearly
covers
the
bottles
then
raise
the
temperature
of
the
water
quickly
to
the
boiling
point
and
after
it
has
begun
to
bubble
allow
it
to
boil
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
at
the
end
of
this
time
cool
the
milk
rapidly
and
then
keep
it
cool
until
it
is
used
although
milk
thus
treated
becomes
safe
sterilization
changes
its
flavor
and
digestibility
if
milk
of
this
kind
must
be
used
some
raw
food
should
be
given
with
it
a
diet
composed
entirely
of
cooked
food
is
not
so
ideal
as
one
in
which
some
raw
food
is
included
because
raw
foods
contain
substances
that
are
essential
to
health
the
change
that
takes
place
in
the
composition
of
milk
that
has
been
sterilized
can
be
easily
observed
such
milk
on
becoming
sour
does
not
coagulate
as
does
pasteurized
or
raw
milk
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
lime
salts
in
the
milk
are
so
changed
by
the
high
temperature
as
to
prevent
the
thickening
process
from
taking
place
then
too
sterilized
milk
is
not
likely
to
become
sour
even
after
considerable
time
still
such
milk
is
not
safe
to
use
except
when
it
is
fresh
for
instead
of
fermenting
in
the
usual
way
it
putrefies
and
is

ptomaine
poisoning

must
be

but
in
order
to
make
it
a
more
nearly
ideal

for
them
it
must
usually
be
modified
or
changed
by
adding
other
materials
when
it

it
is

such

of
purity
and
the
producer
must
handle
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
may
be
delivered
to
the
consumer
in
as
clean
and
fresh
a
condition
as
possible
without
doubt
a
grading
similar
to
this
one
will
become
general
throughout
the
united
states
eventually
for
this
is
the
only
way
by
which
the
housewife
may
know
with
certainty
whether
or
not
the
milk
she
purchases
is
of
the
right
composition
and
is
safe
fresh
and
sanitary
in
every
respect
the
different
qualities
of
milk
and
cream
as
shown
by
this
grading
are
of
course
sold
at
different
prices
those
which
require
the
greatest
care
and
expense
in
handling
selling
for
the
highest
price
milk
in
the
home
purchase
of
milk
after
the
housewife
has
become
familiar
with
the
points
that
she
should
know
concerning
milk
she
will
be
much
better
equipped
to
purchase
milk
of
the
right
kind
for
her
home
however
there
are
still
some
points
for
her
to
observe
when
she
is
purchasing
milk
if
she
would
supply
her
family
with
the
best
quality
of
this
food
in
the
first
place
she
should
buy
milk
from
a
reliable
dealer
who
will
not
object
to
questioning
and
if
possible
she
should
make
an
investigation
of
the
dairy
that
supplies
the
milk
that
she
uses
if
she
can
not
investigate
the
dairy
personally
she
should
at
least
endeavor
to
obtain
information
from
those
who
are
prepared
to
give
it
if
she
learns
that
the
conditions
in
the
dairy
that
is
supplying
her
with
milk
are
not
what
they
should
be
she
should
try
to
obtain
milk
from
some
other
source
of
course
she
should
remember
that
milk
of
the
best
and
cleanest
quality
is
the
highest
in
price
because
of
the
increased
cost
of
production
but
it
is
usually
advisable
to
pay
the
higher
price
especially
if
children
are
to
be
fed
because
cheap
milk
is
liable
to
be
unsafe
at
least
for
any
purpose
that
will
require
it
to
be
served
without
cooking
should
the
income
not
allow
the
best
quality
of
milk
to
be
used
for
all
purposes
a
cheaper
grade
can
be
used
for
cooking
but
it
is
always
economical
to
purchase
the
best
quality
when
this
food
is
to
be
used
as
a
beverage
illustration
fig
in
the
next
place
the
housewife
should
purchase
milk
from
a
dealer
who
delivers
cold
milk
because
as
has
been
mentioned
bacteria
multiply
rapidly
in
warm
milk
she
should
also
try
to
obtain
milk
put
up
in
bottles
for
such
milk
has
advantages
over
milk
dipped
from
a
can
in
that
it
does
not
have
the
same
chance
to
become
dirty
and
it
affords
a
greater
opportunity
to
secure
accurate
measurement
the
kind
of
caps
used
on
milk
bottles
should
also
be
observed
caps
that
have
to
be
pried
out
with
a
knife
or
a
similar
utensil
are
not
nearly
so
satisfactory
as
those
shown
in
fig
which
have
small
tabs
that
permit
the
cap
to
be
lifted
out
in
addition
to
the
caps
which
serve
to
keep
dirt
out
of
the
milk
and
permit
it
to
be
delivered
without
being
spilled
some
dealers
use
covers
like
that
shown
in
such
covers
are
held
in
place
by
a
wire
and
serve
further
to
protect
the
milk
from
contamination
if
milk
purchased
in
bottles
is
clean
there
should
be
no
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
after
it
has
been
allowed
to
stand
for
some
time
also
if
it
is
fresh
it
will
not
sour
quickly
after
it
is
delivered
so
that
in
case
it
is
properly
cared
for
and
sours
quickly
it
may
be
known
to
be
stale
milk
however
if
it
does
not
sour
in
the
normal
length
of
time
it
should
be
looked
on
with
suspicion
for
as
has
been
pointed
out
such
milk
may
have
added
to
it
a
preservative
to
prevent
souring
the
housewife
may
expect
milk
that
is
delivered
cold
and
is
guaranteed
to
be
sanitary
and
fresh
to
remain
sweet
at
least

provided
of

necessity
for

if
milk
of
good
quality
is
bought
and
as
has
been
suggested
this
should
be
done
whenever
it
is
possible
the
next
thing
to
do
is
to
care
for
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
may
be
fed
to
the
family
in
the
same
condition
as
it
was
when
delivered
it
is
of
course
of
prime
importance
that
the
dairyman
deliver
clean
fresh
milk
but
this
is
not
sufficient
the
milk
must
remain
in
this
condition
until
it
is
used
and
this
can
occur
only
when
the
housewife
knows
how
to
care
for
it
properly
after
it
enters
the
home
it
is
possible
to
make
safe
milk
unsafe
and
unsafe
milk
positively
dangerous
unless
the
housewife
understands
how
to
care
for
milk
and
puts
into
practice
what
she
knows
concerning
this
matter
indeed
some
of
the
blame
laid
to
the
careless
handling
of
milk
by
dairymen
really
belongs
to
housewives
for
very
often
they
do
not
take
care
of
milk
in
the
right
way
after
delivery
as
too
much
attention
can
not
be
given
to
this
matter
explicit
directions
are
here
outlined
with
the
idea
of
assisting
the
housewife
in
this
matter
as
much
as
possible
keeping
milk
clean
in
the
immediately
upon
delivery
the
bottle
containing
the
milk
should
be
placed
in
the
coolest
place
available
never
being
allowed
to
stand
on
the
porch
in
the
sun
or
where
such
animals
as
cats
or
dogs
may
come
in
contact
with
it
when
the
milk
is
to
be
used
the
paper
cap
should
be
carefully
wiped
before
it
is
removed
from
the
bottle
so
that
any
dirt
that
may
be
on
top
will
not
fall
into
the
milk
if
not
all
the
milk
is
used
and
the
bottle
must
be
returned
to
the
cool
place
where
it
is
kept
it
should
be
covered
by
means
of
an
inverted
drinking
glass
or
as
shown
in
fig
by
a
glass
or
porcelain
cover
such
covers
or
as
they
are
called
are
very
convenient
for
this
purpose
and
may
be
purchased
at
a
slight
cost
another
precaution
that
should
be
taken
is
never
to
mix
stale
milk
with
fresh
milk
because
the
entire
quantity
will
become
sour
in
the
same
length
of
time
as
the
stale
milk
would
also
milk
that
has
been
poured
into
a
pitcher
or
any
other
open
vessel
and
allowed
to
stand
exposed
to
the
air
for
some
time
should
never
be
put
back
into
the
bottle
with
the
remaining
milk
such
milk
is
sure
to
be
contaminated
with
the
germs
that
are
always
present
in
the
dust
constantly
circulating
in
the
air
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
keep
milk
in
a
vessel
other
than
the
bottle
in
which
it
is
delivered
in
such
an
event
the
vessel
that
is
used
should
be
washed
thoroughly
boiled
in
clean
water
and
cooled
before
the
milk
is
poured
into
it
illustration
fig
particular
care
should
be
taken
of
the
empty
milk
bottles
they
should
never
be
used
for
anything
except
milk
before
they
are
returned
to
the
dairyman
to
be
used
again
they
should
first
be
rinsed
with
cold
water
then
washed
thoroughly
with
hot
soapy
water
and
finally
rinsed
with
hot
water
if
there
is
illness
in
the
home
the
washed
bottles
should
be
put
into
a
pan
of
cool
water
allowed
to
come
to
a
boil
and
permitted
to
boil
for
a
few
minutes
such
attention
will
free
the
bottles
from
any
contamination
they
might
have
received
the
dairyman
of
course
gives
the
bottles
further
attention
before
he
uses
them
again
but
the
housewife
should
do
her
part
by
making
sure
that
they
are
thoroughly
cleansed
before
they
are
collected
by
him
keeping
milk
cool
in
the
as
has
been
pointed
out
milk
should
upon
being
received
be
kept
in
the
coolest
place
available
which
in
the
majority
of
homes
at
the
present
time
is
the
refrigerator
in
making
use
of
the
refrigerator
for
this
purpose
the
housewife
should
put
into
practice
what
she
learned
in
of
part
concerning
the
proper
placing
of
food
in
the
refrigerator
remembering
that
milk
should
be
placed
where
it
will
remain
the
coolest
and
where
it
is
least
likely
to
absorb
odors
she
should
also
bear
in
mind
that
the
temperature
inside
of
a
refrigerator
varies
with
that
of
the
surrounding
air
it
is
because
of
this
fact
that
milk
often
sours
when
the
temperature
is
high
as
in
summer
for
instance
even
though
it
is
kept
in
the
refrigerator
in
case
a
refrigerator
is
not
available
it
will
be
necessary
to
resort
to
other
means
of
keeping
milk
cool
a
cool
cellar
or
basement
is
an
excellent
substitute
but
if
milk
is
kept
in
either
of
these
places
it
must
be
tightly
covered
then
too
the
spring
house
with
its
stream
of
running
water
is
fully
as
good
as
a
refrigerator
and
is
used
extensively
in
farming
districts
but
even
though
a
housewife
has
none
of
these
at
her
disposal
she
need
not
be
deprived
of
fresh
milk
for
there
are
still
other
ways
of
keeping
milk
cool
and
consequently
fresh
a
very
simple
way
in
which
to
keep
milk
cool
is
to
weight
down
the
bottles
in
a
vessel
that
is
deeper
than
they
are
and
then
pour
cold
water
into
the
vessel
until
it
reaches
the
top
of
the
bottles
replacing
the
water
occasionally
as
it
becomes
warm
a
still
better
way
however
so
far
as
convenience
and
results
are
concerned
is
that
illustrated
in
fig
as
shown
wrap
the
bottle
in
a
clean
towel
or
piece
of
cotton
cloth
so
that
one
corner
of
it
is
left
loose

place
this

such
an
arrangement
will
keep

milk
points
to
be
observed
in
cooking
because
of
the
nature
of
milk
and
its
constituents
the
cooking
of
this
liquid
is
a
little
more
difficult
than
would
appear
at
first
thought
in
fact
heating
milk
to
a
temperature
greater
than
degrees
fahrenheit
causes
several
changes
to
occur
in
it
one
of
which
the
coagulation
of
the
albumin
has
already
been
mentioned
as
the
albumin
hardens
into
the
layer
that
forms
on
the
top
of
boiled
milk
a
certain
amount
of
fat
sugar
and
casein
becomes
entangled
in
it
and
if
the
coagulated
skin
is
rejected
these
food
substances
in
addition
to
the
albumin
are
lost
another
change
that
results
from
boiling
is
in
the
fat
globules
that
remain
for
these
separate
and
exist
no
longer
in
the
form
of
cream
when
milk
that
is
not
perfectly
fresh
is
cooked
with
other
materials
or
soups
sauces
and
puddings
it
sometimes
curdles
to
prevent
curdling
the
milk
should
be
heated
as
rapidly
as
possible
before
it
is
used
with
the
other
ingredients
while
the
separate
heating
of
the
milk
involves
a
little
more
work
time
may
be
gained
by
heating
the
milk
while
the
remaining
ingredients
are
being
prepared
the
curdling
of
comparatively
fresh
milk
is
often
caused
by
the
addition
of
salt
especially
if
the
salt
is
added
when
the
milk
is
hot
however
if
a
pinch
of
bicarbonate
of
soda
is
added
to
the
milk
before
it
is
heated
it
will
not
be
likely
to
curdle
even
though
it
is
not
absolutely
fresh
when
tomato
is
to
be
used
in
soup
that
contains
milk
or
cream
curdling
can
be
prevented
if
the
milk
or
the
cream
to
be
used
is
thickened
with
flour
or
corn
starch
or
a
little
soda
is
added
to
the
tomato
before
the
two
are
mixed
the
mixing
is
accomplished
by
pouring
the
into
the
instead
of
the
milk
into
the
tomato
when
acid
fruit
juices
are
to
be
added
to
milk
or
cream
and
the
mixture
then
frozen
curdling
can
be
prevented
by
thoroughly
chilling
the
milk
or
cream
in
the
freezer
can
before
combining
it
with
the
juices
as
has
already
been
learned
great
care
must
be
taken
in
the
heating
of
milk
because
the
solids
that
it
contains
adhere
quickly
to
the
bottom
of
the
pan
and
cause
the
milk
to
scorch
for
this
reason
milk
should
never
be
heated
directly
over
the
flame
unless
the
intention
is
to
boil
it
and
even
if
it
must
be
boiled
every
precaution
should
be
taken
to
prevent
it
from
burning
it
should
be
remembered
too
that
a
very
small
scorched
area
will
be
sufficient
to
make
a
quantity
of
milk
taste
burned
the
utensil
in
which
milk
can
be
heated
in
the
most
satisfactory
way
is
the
double
boiler
for
the
milk
does
not
come
in
direct
contact
with
the
heat
in
this
utensil
if
a
double
boiler
is
not
available
good
results
can
be
obtained
by
setting
one
pan
into
another
that
contains
water
milk
is
often
used
in
place
of
water
for
cooking
cereals
beverages
puddings
soups
etc
this
is
good
practice
and
should
be
followed
whenever
possible
for
when
milk
is
added
it
serves
to
increase
the
nutritive
value
of
the
food
it
should
be
observed
however
that
more
time
is
required
to
cook
grains
or
cereals
in
milk
than
to
cook
them
in
water
because
milk
contains
more
solid
matter
than
water
and
is
not
absorbed
so
quickly
another
frequent
use
of
milk
is
in
breads
and
biscuits
where
as
is
explained
in
and
it
produces
a
browner
and
more
tender
crust
than
water
variety
of
ways
to
use
milk
in
because
of
the
numerous
purposes
for
which
milk
is
required
in
the
preparation
of
foods
the
smallest
amount
of
it
whether
sweet
or
sour
can
be
utilized
in
cooking
therefore
no
milk
need
ever
be
wasted
a
few
of
the
uses
to
which
this
food
is
oftenest
put
are
mentioned
briefly
in
order
that
the
housewife
may
be
familiar
enough
with
them
to
call
them
to
mind
whenever
she
desires
to
carry
out
a
recipe
that
calls
for
milk
or
when
she
has
occasion
to
utilize
milk
that
she
has
on
hand
milk
thickened
slightly
with
flour
and
flavored
with
such
material
as
corn
asparagus
celery
tomatoes
beans
peas
or
fish
makes
a
delicious
soup
in
bisques
or
thickened
soups
and
in
chowders
the
liquid
used
need
not
be
milk
but
these
are
made
very
appetizing
if
milk
is
used
for
part
or
all
of
the
liquid
then
too
sauces
or
gravies
made
with
milk
thickened
with
flour
and
made
rich
with
butter
or
other
fat
lend
themselves
to
a
variety
of
uses
dice
of
vegetables
meat
fish
or
game

to
a
sauce
of
this
kind
and
served
in

the
desired
result
may
require
as
is
well
known
milk
is
practically
indispensable
in
the
making
of
cakes
cookies
quick
breads
and
in
fact
nearly
all
dough
mixtures
even
if
it
has
soured
it
can
be
used
with

to
take
the
place
of

produced
commercially
recipes
for
milk
dishes
and
sauces
foods
containing
milk
from
the
discussion
given
up
to
this
point
it
will
be
noted
that
milk
is
used
in
a
large
variety
of
ways
and
in
the
making
of
numerous
dishes
however
most
of
the
dishes
in
which
this
liquid
occurs
involve
other
important
materials
so
that
the
recipes
for
them
are
usually
listed
under
some
other
ingredient
or
division
of
cookery
for
instance
milk
is
used
in
the
making
of
ice
cream
but
as
the
ice
creams
are
included
among
cold
desserts
recipes
for
them
would
naturally
come
in
the
section
pertaining
to
this
subject
milk
is
also
an
important
ingredient
in
puddings
but
the
recipes
for
such
dishes
are
given
in
the
section
in
which
puddings
and
their
sauces
are
discussed
because
of
this
fact
there
are
only
a
few
recipes
that
have
milk
as
their
basis
and
this
accounts
for
the
small
number
of
recipes
here
given
chief
among
the
recipes
that
involve
principally
milk
are
those
for
junket
and
white
sauce
and
while
the
number
of
these
is
small
and
the
use
of
the
dishes
not
so
general
as
some
kinds
of
food
just
as
much
attention
should
be
given
to
them
as
if
they
occurred
in
greater
numbers
and
were
used
more
commonly
junket
is
very
easily
made
and
should
therefore
cause
the
housewife
no
concern
likewise
little
difficulty
will
be
experienced
if
the
directions
here
given
for
white

are
followed
explicitly

and
sold
in
the
form
of
tablets
called
when
these
tablets
are
used
properly
with
milk
they
coagulate
the
milk
and
make
an
excellent
dessert
that
resembles
custard
and
that
is
very
easy
to
digest
because
of
its
nature
and
qualities
this
kind
of
dessert
is
used
largely
for
invalids

recipes
for
white
sauce
three
white
sauces
are
commonly
used
for
different
purposes
and
in
each
one
of
them
milk
is
the
basis
these
sauces
differ
from
one
another
in
thickness
and
include
white
which
is
used
for
cream
toast
and
soups
white
which
is
used
for
dressing
vegetables
and
is
flavored
in
various
ways
to
accompany
meats
patties
or
croquettes
and
white
which
is
used
to
mix
with
the
materials
used
for
croquettes
in
order
to
hold
them
together
to
insure
the
best
results
the
proportion
of
flour
and
liquid
should
be
learned
for
each
kind
and
to
avoid
the
formation
of
lumps
the
proper
method
of
mixing
should
be
carefully
followed

a
white
sauce
properly
made
is
perfectly
smooth
and
since
only
little
care
is
needed
to
produce
such
a
result
it
is
inexcusable
to
serve
a
lumpy
sauce
also
nothing
is
more
disagreeable
than
thick
pasty
sauce
but
this
can
be
avoided
by
employing
the
right
proportion
of
flour
and
milk
the
ingredients
and
their
proportions
for
the
various
kinds
of

each
of
which

its
advantages
these
methods
which
are
here
given
should
be
carefully
observed
for
they
apply
not

to

making
of
this
particular
sauce
but
to
the
combining
of

cook
minutes
stirring
constantly
to
prevent
the
sauce
from
scorching
sauce
made
according
to
this
method
does
not
require
long
cooking
because
the
flour
added
to
the
hot
fat
cooks
quickly
in
fact
it
is
a
very
desirable
method
for
the
browned
butter
and
the
flour
lend
flavor
to
the
sauce
many
otherwise
unattractive
or
rather
tasteless
foods
can
be
made
much
more
appetizing
by
the
addition
of
white
sauce
made
in
this
way
put
the
milk
on
to
heat
while
this
is
heating
stir
the
butter
flour
and

they
are
soft
and
well
mixed

to
them
slowly
stirring

place
over
the
heat
and
finish
cooking
or
cook
in

sauce
made
by
this
method
requires
longer
cooking
than
the
preceding
one
and
it
has
less
flavor

a
small
portion

the
heat
if
cooked
in

stir
only
until
the
mixture
is
completely
thickened
and
then
continue
to
cook
for
or
minutes
when
butter
is
added
to
the
mixture
in
this
way
it
is
likely
to
float
on
top
especially
if
too
much
is
used
a
better

be
made
according

the

the
united
states
authorities
have
set
a
standard
for
the
composition
of
butter
which
allows
this
product
to
contain
not
more
than
per
cent
of
water
and
requires
it
to
have
at
least
per
cent
of
butter
fat
economical
use
of
in
the
home
butter
is
used
on
the
table
and
in
the
cooking
of
many
foods
hardly
any
article
of
food
has
such
general
use
as
this
one
in
fact
a
meal
is
usually
considered
to
be
incomplete
without
it
both
as
an
accompaniment
to
bread
rolls
biscuits
or
whatever
variety
of
these
is
used
and
as
an
ingredient
in
the
cooking
of
some
foods
that
require
fat
but
butter
is
not
cheap
so
that
the
wise
and
economical
use
of
this
food
in
the
home
is
a
point
that
should
not
be
overlooked
by
the
housewife
this
precaution
is
very
important
it
having
been
determined
that
butter
as
well
as
other
fats
is
wasted
to
a
great
extent
and
still
it
is
true
that
no
other
material
can
be
so
economically
utilized
the
very
smallest
amount
of
any
kind
of
fat
should
be
carefully
saved
for
there
are
numerous
uses
to
which
it
can
be
put
even
though
it
is
mixed
with
other
food
it
can
always
be
melted
out
clarified
that
is
freed
from
foreign
substances
and
then
used
for
some
purpose
in
cooking
the
chief
way
in
which
butter
is
wasted
is
in
the
unnecessary
and
improper
use
of
it
points
that
a
little
careful
thought
will
do
much
to
remedy
flavor
and
composition
of
that
the
housewife
may
have
an
understanding
of
the
food
substances
found
in
butter
and
also
learn
how
to
determine
the
quantity
of
butter
needed
for
her
family
she
should
become
familiar
with
the
composition
of
this
food
the
flavor
of
butter
depends
to
a
great
extent
on
the
kind
of
cream
from
which
it
is
made
both
sweet
and
sour
cream
being
used
for
this
purpose
of
these
two
kinds
sour
cream
is
the
preferable
one
because
it
gives
to
the
butter
a
desirable
flavor
still
the
unsalted
butter
that
is
made
from
sweet
cream
is
apparently
growing
in
favor
although
it
is
usually
more
expensive
than
salted
butter
the
difference
in
price
is
due
to
the
fact
that
unsalted
butter
spoils
readily
so
far
as
its
food
substances
are
concerned
butter
is
composed
largely
of
fat
but
it
also
contains
water
protein
in
the
form
of
casein
and
mineral
matter
the
quantity
of
water
contained
in
butter
determines
to
a
large
extent
the
weight
of
butter
since
water
is
heavier
than
fat
but
as
only
per
cent
of
water
is
allowed
butter
that
contains
more
water
than
this
is
considered
to
be
adulterated
as
very
little
milk
is
retained
in
butter
only
a
small
percentage
of
protein
is
found
in
this
food
however
a
considerable
quantity
of
mineral
salts
are
present
and
these
make
it
more
valuable
than
most
of
the
other
fats
because
of
the
nature
of
its
composition
a
very
high
percentage
of
fat
and
a
low
percentage
of
protein
butter
is
distinctly
a
fuel
food
that
is
a
food
of
course
there
are
cheaper
fats
some
of
which
are
even
better
foods
than
butter
but
as
their
flavor
is
not
especially
agreeable
to
some
persons
they
are
not
used
so
extensively
in
view
of
the
nature
of
the
composition
of
this
food
an
ounce
of
butter
a
day
is
the
average
allowance
for
each
person
when
the
diet
of
a
family
contains
meat
and
such
other
fats
as
lard
olive
oil
etc
at
the
most
pound
of
butter
should
be
purchased
each
week
for
each
member
of
the
family
for
table
use
and
fats
cheaper
than
butter
should
be
used
for
cooking
purposes
purchasing
as
in
the
case
of
milk
in
order
that
the
housewife
may
judge
the
quality
of
the
butter
she
purchases
she
will
do
well
to
look
into
the
cleanliness
and
sanitary
condition
of
the
dairy
that
produces
it
too
much
attention
can
not
be
given
to
this
matter
for
if
cream
becomes
contaminated
from
careless
handling
the
same
contamination
is
liable
to
occur
in
the
butter
made
from
it
butter
that
is
produced
in
dairies
that
make
large
quantities
of
it
usually
has
not
much
opportunity
to
become
contaminated
before
it
reaches
the
consumer
for
it
is
generally
pressed
into
prints
and
each
one
of
these
is
then
wrapped
and
placed
in
a
paper
carton
on
the
other
hand
the
farmer
and
the
dairyman
doing
a
small
business
do
not
find
it
profitable
to
install
the
equipment
required
to
put
up
butter
in
this
way
so
they
usually
pack
their
butter
into
firkins
or
crocks
or
make
it
into
rolls
when
such
butter
goes
to
market
it
is
generally
placed
in
a
refrigerator
with
more
butter
of
the
same
sort
some
of
which
is
good
and
some
bad
as
butter
absorbs
any
strong
odor
present
in
the
refrigerator
and
is
perhaps
cut
and
weighed
in
a
most
unsanitary
manner
the
good
becomes
contaminated
with
the
bad
while
butter
of
this
kind
is
perhaps
a
few
cents
cheaper
than
that
which
is
handled
in
a
more
sanitary
way
it
is
less
desirable
and
if
possible
should
be
avoided
by
the
housewife
in
case
butter
is
obtained
from
a
certain
farm
the
conditions
on
that
farm
should
be
looked
into
for
the
same
reason
that
the
conditions
in
a
dairy
are
investigated
to
be
able
to
select
good
butter
the
housewife
should
also
be
familiar
with
its
characteristics
in
color
butter
to
be
good
should
be
an
even
yellow
neither
too
pale
nor
too
bright
and
should
contain
no
streaks
the
light
streaks
that
are
sometimes
found
in
butter
indicate
insufficient
working
as
to
odor
butter
should
be
pleasing
and
appetizing
any
foreign
or
strong
disagreeable
odor
being
extremely
objectionable
stale
butter
or
that
which
is
improperly
kept
develops
an
acid
called
which
gives
a
disagreeable
odor
and
flavor
to
butter
and
often
renders
it
unfit
for
use
care
of
the
precautions
that
the
farmer
and
dairyman
are
called
on
to
observe
in
the
making
and
handling
of
butter
should
be
continued
by
the
housewife
after
she
purchases
butter
for
home
use
the
chief
point
for
her
to
remember
is
that
butter
should
be
kept
as
cold
as
possible
because
a
low
temperature
prevents
it
from
spoiling
whereas
a
high
one
causes
it
to
become
soft
and
less
appetizing
the
most
satisfactory
place
in
which
to
keep
butter
is
the
refrigerator
where
it
should
be
placed
in
the
compartment
located
directly
under
the
ice
and
in
which
the
milk
is
kept
for
here
it
will
not
come
in
contact
with
foods
that
might
impart
their
flavors
to
it
should
no
refrigerator
be
available
some
other
means
of
keeping
butter
cold
must
be
resorted
to
such
as
a
cool
cellar
or
basement
or
a
window
box
the
way
in
which
butter
is
bought
determines
to
a
certain
extent
the
method
of
caring
for
it
if
it
is
bought
in
paper
cartons
it
should
be
rewrapped
and
replaced
in
the
carton
each
time
some
is
cut
off
for
use
in
case
it
is
bought
in
bulk
it
should
never
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
wooden
dish
in
which
it
is
often
sold
rather
it
should
be
put
into
a
crock
or
a
jar
that
can
be
tightly
covered
attention
should
also
be
given
to
butter
that
is
cut
from
the
supply
for
the
table
or
for
cooking
purposes
and
that
is
not
entirely
used
such
butter
should
never
be
returned
to
the
original
supply
but
should
be
kept
in
a
separate
receptacle
and
used
for
cooking
if
it
contains
foreign
material
it
can
be
clarified
by
allowing
it
to
stand
after
it
has
melted
until
this
has
settled
and
then
dipping
or
pouring
the
clear
fat
from
the
top
butter
that
has
become
rancid
or
has
developed
a
bad
flavor
need
not
be
wasted
either
for
it
can
be
made
ready
for
use
in
cooking
simply
by
pouring
boiling
water
over
it
allowing
it
to
cool
and
then
removing
the
layer
of
fat
that
comes
to
the
top
such
butter
of
course
can
not
be
used
for
serving
on
the
table
still
consideration
on
the
part
of
the
housewife
to
just
such
matters
as
these
will
prevent
much
of
the
waste
that
prevails
in
the
household
in
the
use
of
this
food
cooking
with
while
some
housewives
make
it
a
practice
to
use
butter
in
cooking
of
all
kinds
there
are
uses
in
which
other
fats
are
preferable
or
in
case
butter
is
desired
there
are
certain
points
to
be
observed
in
its
use
for
instance
butter
is
rendered
less
digestible
by
cooking
it
at
a
high
temperature
as
in
frying
or
sautéing
also
it
can
not
be
used
to
any
extent
for
the
frying
of
foods
as
it
burns
very
readily
if
it
is
used
for
sautéing
the
dish
is
made
much
more
expensive
than
is
necessary
so
that
in
most
cases
a
cheaper
fat
should
be
employed
for
this
purpose
in
addition
a
point
to
remember
is
that
this
fat
should
not
be
used
to
grease
the
pans
in
which
cakes
and
hot
breads
are
baked
unless
it
is
first
melted
because
the
milk
contained
in
the
butter
burns
easily
after
it
is
melted
only
the
top
fat
should
be
used
when
butter
is
desired
for
very
rich
cakes
and
for
pastry
it
is
usually
washed
in
cold
water
to
remove
the
milk
to
neutralize
the
sour
milk
contained
in
butter
that
is
used
for
baking
purposes
a
little
soda
is
sometimes
employed
further
economy
can
be
exercised
in
the
use
of
butter
if
a
little
thought
is
given
to
the
matter
for
instance
when
butter
is
melted
and
poured
over
meat
or
fish
that
has
been
broiled
or
over
vegetables
that
have
been
cooked
in
a
plain
way
much
of
it
usually
remains
in
the
dish
and
is
wasted
such
butter
can
be
utilized
again
since
butter
undergoes
a
change
when
it
is
cooked
it
should
be
mixed
with
cooked
foods
to
flavor
them
rather
than
be
subjected
to
the
temperature
necessary
for
cooking
when
butter
is
used
for
spreading
sandwiches
it
usually
will
be
found
advisable
to
soften
the
butter
by
creaming
it
with
a
spoon
but
it
should
never
be
melted
for
this
purpose
serving
when
butter
is
used
for
the
table
some
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
serving
of
it
probably
the
most
usual
way
of
serving
butter
is
to
place
a
slice
of
it
on
a
plate
and
then
pass
the
plate
with
a
knife
to
each
person
at
the
table
the
advantage
of
this
method
is
that
each
person
can
take
the
amount
desired
and
thus
prevent
waste
however
a
still
more
desirable
way
of
serving
butter
that
is
to
be
passed
is
to
cut
it
into
small
cubes
or
squares
or
to
shape
it
into
small
balls
and
then
serve
it
with
a
fork
or
a
butter
knife
to
prevent
the
pieces
or
balls
of
butter
from
melting
in
warm
weather
cracked
ice
may
be
placed
on
the
butter
dish
with
them
butter
cut
into
cubes
or
squares
may
also
be
served
on
an
individual
butter
dish
or
an
individual
plate
placed
at
each
place
before
the
meal
is
served
whichever
plan
is
adopted
any
fragments
of
butter
that
remain
on
the
plates
after
a
meal
should
be
gathered
up
and
used
for
cooking
purposes
illustration
fig
butter
that
comes
in
pound
prints
lends
itself
readily
to
the
cutting
of
small
cubes
or
squares
for
serving
such
butter
may
be
cut
by
drawing
a
string
through
the
print

by
using
a
knife
whose
cutting
edge
is
covered
with
paper
a
small
piece
of
the
oiled
paper
such
as
that
in
which
the
butter
is
wrapped
answering
very
well
for
this
purpose
if
butter

are
desired
for
serving
they
may
be
rolled
with
butter
paddles
in
the
manner
shown
in

make

put
wads
of
the
butter
to
be
used
into

to
make

place
each
wad
between
the
paddles
as

give
the

a
circular
motion
after
a
little
practice
it
will
be
a
simple
matter
to
make

for

know
the
quantity
of

substitutes
in
about
the
year
through
a
desire
to
procure
a
cheaper
article
than
butter
for
the
poorer
classes
of
france
came
the
manufacture
of
the
first
substitute
for
butter
since
that
time
the
use
of
butter
substitutes
has
gradually
increased
until
at
the
present
time
millions
of
pounds
are
consumed
every
year
a
certain
amount
of
prejudice
against
their
use
exists
but
much
of
this
is
unnecessary
for
they
are
less
likely
to
be
contaminated
with
harmful
bacteria
than
the
poorer
qualities
of
butter
then
too
they
do
not
spoil
so
readily
and
for
this
reason
they
can
be
handled
with
greater
convenience
than
butter
the
best
substitute
for
butter
and
the
one
most
largely
used
is
called
oleomargarine
which
in
the
united
states
alone
constitutes
about
two
and
per
cent
of
all
the
fat
used
as
butter
this
fat
is
called
by
various
other
names
such
as
and
but
oleomargarine
is
the
name
by
which
the
united
states
authorities
recognize
the
product
it
is
made
by
churning
fats
other
than
butter
fat
with
milk
or
cream
until
a
butterlike
consistency
is
obtained
originally
pure
beef
fat
was
employed
for
this
purpose
and
while
beef
fat
is
used
to
a
great
extent
at
present
lard
cottonseed
oil
coconut
oil
and
peanut
oil
are
also
used
whatever
fats
are
selected
are
churned
with
milk
cream
and
for
the
finest
grades
a
considerable
percentage
of
the
very
best
pure
butter
after
they
are
churned
the
oleomargarine
is
worked
salted
and
packed
in
the
same
manner
as
butter
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
butter
substitutes
are
controlled
by
laws
that
while
they
do
not
specify
the
kind
of
fat
to
be
used
state
that
all
mixtures
of
butter
with
other
fats
must
be
sold
as
oleomargarine
they
also
require
that
a
tax
of
cents
a
pound
be
paid
on
all
artificially
colored
oleomargarine
therefore
while
coloring
matter
is
used
in
some
cases
this
product
is
usually
sold
without
coloring
in
such
an
event
coloring
matter
is
given
with
each
pound
of
oleomargarine
that
is
sold
before
using
the
oleomargarine
this
coloring
matter
is
simply
worked
into
the
fat
until
it
is
evenly
colored
renovated
another
substitute
that
is
sometimes
used
to
take
the
place
of
the
best
grades
of
butter
is
renovated
or
process
butter
this
is
obtained
by
purifying
butter
that
is
dirty
and
rancid
and
that
contains
all
sorts
of
foreign
material
and
then
rechurning
it
with
fresh
cream
or
milk
the
purifying
process
consists
in
melting
the
butter
removing
the
scum
from
the
top
as
well
as
the
buttermilk
brine
and
foreign
materials
that
settle
and
then
blowing
air
through
the
fat
to
remove
any
odors
that
it
might
contain
butter
that
is
thus
purified
is
replaced
on
the
market
but
in
some
states
the
authorities
have
seen
fit
to
restrict
its
sale
while
such
restrictions
are
without
doubt
justifiable
it
is
possible
to
buy
butter
that
is
more
objectionable
than
renovated
or
process
butter
but
that
has
no
restriction
on
it
method
of
testing
butter
very
often
oleomargarine
and
process
butter
bear
such
a
close
resemblance
to
genuine
butter
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
detect
the
difference
however
there
is
a
simple
test
by
which
these
substitutes
can
always
be
distinguished
from
butter
and
this
should
be
applied
whenever
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
matter
to
make
this
test
place
the
fat
in
a
tablespoon
or
a
small
dish
and
heat
it
directly
over
the
flame
until
it
boils
stirring
it
occasionally
to
assist
in
the
melting
if
it
is
oleomargarine
or
process
butter
it
will
sputter
noisily
and
take
on
a
curdled
appearance
whereas
if
it
is
butter
it
will
melt
and
even
boil
without
sputtering
although
it
foams

cheese
characteristics
and
care
of
cheese
origin
production
and
use
of
cheese
is
a
product
that
is
manufactured
from
the
solids
of
milk
and
it
provides
a
valuable
food
the
making
of
cheese
was
known
in
ancient
times
it
having
probably
originated
through
a
desire
to
utilize
an
oversupply
of
milk
when
cheese
was
first
made
the
fact
that
bacteria
were
present
was
not
known
nor
were
the
reasons
for
the
spoiling
of
milk
understood
but
it
was
learned
that
milk
can
be
kept
if
most
of
its
water
is
removed
this
discovery
was
very
important
for
it
led
to
various
methods
of
making
cheese
and
proved
that
cheese
making
was
a
satisfactory
and
convenient
means
of
storing
nourishment
in
a
form
that
was
not
bulky
and
that
would
keep
for
long
periods
of
time
from
a
very
small
beginning
the
different
methods
of
making
cheese
became
popular
until
at
the
present
time
more
than
three
hundred
varieties
are
made
and
their
manufacture
forms
one
of
the
large
industries
of
the
world
in
the
united
states
nearly
all
the
cheese
used
up
to
about
years
ago
was
made
on
farms
and
to
a
great
extent
by
housewives
but
about
that
time
a
factory
for
the
making
of
this
product
was
started
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
it
proved
a
profitable
enterprise
from
this
beginning
the
business
of
making
cheese
commercially
in
this
country
has
grown
until
now
cheese
is
almost
entirely
a
product
in
the
manufacture
of
which
the
states
of
new
york
and
wisconsin
lead
in
either
the
commercial
or
the
home
production
of
cheese
skim
milk
with
all
or
part
of
the
cream
removed
is
used
for
some
varieties
while
whole
milk
is
used
for
others
the
composition
depending
largely
on
the
kind
of
milk
that
is
employed
rennet
is
added
to
the
milk
to
coagulate
it
and
then
the
curd
from
which
nearly
all
the
water
is
removed
is
allowed
to
ripen
to
produce
characteristic
odors
flavors
and
consistency
various
coloring
and
flavoring
materials
as
well
as
bacteria
are
added
to
the
curd
the
action
of
these
bacteria
is
really
the
chief
factor
in
the
making
of
cheese
and
they
are
therefore
not
only
desirable
but
necessary
bacteria
however
result
in
the
formation
of
bad
odors
flavors
and
gases
in
the
finished
product
and
these
must
be
carefully
guarded
against
by
cheese
makers
illustration
fig
cheese
offers
a
valuable
source
of
nutriment
for
the
body
because
its
food
value
ranks
high
as
is
shown
in
fig
the
food
value
in
pound
of
cheese
is
equivalent
to
that
in
pounds
of
beef
that
in
eggs
or
that
in
pounds
of
fish
the
use
of
cheese
however
is
not
nearly
so
great
as
its
food
value
warrants
the
amount
used
in
the
united
states
per
capita
being
only
about
pounds
annually
this
is
a
condition
that
should
be
overcome
for
there
is
a
large
variety
of
ways
in
which
cheese
can
be
used
to
advantage
in
the
diet
when
eaten
raw
it
is
very
appetizing
and
when
used
with
soups
sauces
and
foods
that
have
a
bland
taste
it
lends
additional
flavor
and
makes
an
especially
attractive
dish
in
addition
the
fact
that
it
is
an
economical
food
and
can
be
conveniently
kept
and
stored
should
recommend
its
frequent
use
composition
of
since
cheese
is
a
product
of
milk
it
is
somewhat
similar
to
milk
in
composition
but
the
change
that
occurs
in
the
formation
of
cheese
causes
some
differences
nearly
all
the
water
present
in
milk
is
removed
during
the
manufacture
of
cheese
so
that
this
product
becomes
a
concentrated
food
made
up
of
all
the
nourishment
that
milk
contains
except
small
amounts
of
albumin
milk
sugar
and
mineral
matter
these
because
they
are
in
solution
in
the
water
are
lost
when
the
whey
is
separated
from
the
curd
the
food
substances
that
occur
in
the
largest
amounts
are
fat
and
protein
in
the
form
of
casein
which
is
the
material
of
milk
cheese
made
from
milk
that
contains
some
cream
has
in
it
a
greater
amount
of
fat
than
that
made
from
completely
skimmed
milk
besides
these
two
chief
food
substances
cheese
contains
a
small
amount
of
milk
sugar
mineral
matter
and
water
on
account
of
the
large
quantity
of
protein
found
in
cheese
this
food
can
readily
take
the
place
of
meat
in
the
diet
in
fact
it
has
some
decided
advantages
over
meat
as
has
been
pointed
out
cheese
yields
more
than
twice
as
much
food
value
as
an
equal
weight
of
beef
then
too
the
buying
and
care
of
cheese
are
much
simpler
matters
than
the
buying
and
care
of
meat
as
it
does
not
require
the
low
temperature
that
meat
requires
and
does
not
spoil
so
readily
it
can
be
bought
in
considerable
quantity
and
used
as
desired
without
danger
of
spoiling
and
loss
in
addition
the
use
of
cheese
as
food
does
not
require
so
much
skill
in
preparation
as
meat
does
nor
is
there
loss
of
flavor
and
nutriment
in
its
preparation
as
is
often
the
case
with
meat
quality
of
every
variety
of
cheese
has
its
own
standard
and
quality
some
being
hard
and
dry
others
moist
and
still
others
very
soft
the
difference
in
quality
is
due
to
the
way
in
which
the
curd
is
coagulated
the
amount
of
pressure
that
is
put
on
it
and
the
ripening
of
the
cheese
the
holes
that
often
occur
in
cheese
and
give
it
a
porous
appearance
are
formed
by
gas
which
is
the
product
of
the
growth
of
bacteria
a
large
number
of
very
small
holes
in
cheese
indicate
that
the
milk
used
to
make
it
was
not
clean
and
contained
many
kinds
of
bacteria
this
condition
could
be
overcome
by
the
use
of
absolutely
clean
milk
indeed
milk
of
this
kind
is
as
necessary
for
the
production
of
good
cheese
as
it
is
for
the
making
of
good
butter
certain
cheeses
such
as
limburger
and
roquefort
have
a
typical
odor
and
flavor
the
odor
being
due
to
bacteria
and
the
flavor
to
mold
these
are
carefully
grown
and
introduced
into
the
cheese
during
its
manufacture
care
of
the
very
strong
odor
and
flavor
that
characterize
cheese
make
it
necessary
that
care
be
given
to
cheese
in
the
home
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
coming
in
contact
with
other
foods
and
transmitting
its
odor
and
flavor
to
them
the
best
place
to
keep
cheese
particularly
the
soft
varieties
is
in
the
refrigerator
where
it
should
be
placed
in
a
closed
receptacle
and
kept
as
far
as
possible
from
foods
that
are
easily
tainted
it
is
well
to
avoid
a
damp
place
for
the
keeping
of
cheese
as
mold
frequently
develops
on
the
outside
when
too
much
moisture
is
present
but
in
case
mold
does
appear
it
can
be
removed
by
cutting
a
thin
slice
from
the
side
on
which
it
has
grown
on
the
other
hand
cheese
that
is
kept
in
a
dry
place
becomes
hard
and
dry
unless
it
is
wrapped
in
oiled
paper
or
a
damp
cloth
however
such
cheese
need
not
be
thrown
away

there
are
numerous
uses
particularly
in
cooking
to
which
it
can
be
put

classification
of

the
cheese
used
in

may
be
included
under
two
leading
classes
namely
and
since
the
foreign
cheeses
are
imported
they
are
more
expensive
than
the
cheeses
made
here
and
should
not
be
bought
if
cheese
is
to
be
used
as
an
economical
article
of
food
they
are
valuable
chiefly
for
their
flavor
and
are
generally
bought
for
this
reason
the
domestic
cheeses
can
be
used
in
larger
quantities
for
besides
being
less
expensive
they
are
usually
of
a
milder
type
and
are
more
easily
digested
to
enable
the
housewife
to
become
familiar
with
the
principal
varieties
of
each
of
these
classes
a

of
them

others
have
not
been
successfully
made
while
these
are
not

it
is

for
every

since
american
cheddar
cheese
is
the
kind
that
is
commonly
used
in
this
country
the
way
in
which
it
is
made
will
be
well
to
know
the
milk
used
for
this
kind
of
cheese
is
first
inspected
as
to
cleanliness
and
the
extent
of
fermentation
it
has
undergone
and
when
these
points
are
ascertained
it
is
that
is
allowed
to
sour
to
a
certain
degree
of
acidity
at
this
stage
coloring
matter
is
added
after
which
the
milk
is
prepared
for
setting
by
bringing
it
to
a
certain
temperature
with
the
temperature
at
the
right
point
rennet
is
added
to
coagulate
the
milk
or
form
the
curd
the
milk
is
then
allowed
to
remain
undisturbed
until
the
action
of
the
rennet
is
at
a
certain
point
when
the
curd
is
cut
into
little
pieces
by
drawing
two
sets
of
knives
through
it
and
thus
is
separated
from
the
whey
as
soon
as
the
curd
is
cut
the
temperature
of
the
mass
is
raised
to
help
make
the
curd
firm
and
to
cause
the
little
cubes
to
retain
their
firmness
and
during
the
entire
heating
process
the
whole
mass
is
stirred
constantly
to
assist
in
the
separation
from
the
whey
when
the
curd
is
sufficiently
firm
the
whey
is
removed
and
the
particles
of
curd
are
allowed
to
adhere
and
form
into
a
solid
mass
if
necessary
the
curd
is
cut
again
into
small
pieces
to
get
rid
of
the
excess
whey
but
if
the
curd
is
too
dry
the
pieces
must
be
piled
up
until
they
are
four
or
five
deep
during
this
process
which
is
known
as
the
of
the
cheese
the
curd
is
treated
until
it
is
of
the
proper
texture
to
be
that
is
put
into
a
mill
and
ground
into
small
pieces
the
object
of
milling
the
curd
is
to
cut
it
into
pieces
small
enough
to
permit
of
uniform
salting
and
the
further
escape
of
whey
when
the
curd
has
been
brought
to
this
point
it
is
salted
and
then
pressed
into

finally
it
is

another
american
cheese
that
seems
to
meet
with
a
popular
demand
is
brick
cheese
this
kind
of
cheese
which
is
illustrated
at

gets
its
name
from
the
fact
that
it
is
pressed
into
bricks
under
the
weight
of
one
or

american
the
making
of
cheddar
cheese
and
brick

is
of

done
commercially
but
there
is
a
kind
of
cheese
that
can
be
made
very
conveniently
in
the
home
this
cheese
which
is
generally

in
which
to
utilize
sour
milk

if
a
quart
or
more
can
be
obtained
at
one
time
smaller
quantities
can
generally
be
used
for

purposes
if
properly
made
such
cheese
is
very
digestible
as
it
can
be
seasoned
and
served
in
a
variety
of

in
which
a

dish
such
as

is
undesirable
skim
milk
does
very
well
for
this
kind
of
cheese
so
that
if
the
sour
milk
that
is
to
be
used
has
cream
on
it
the
cream
should
be
removed
before
the
cheese
is
made
otherwise
it
will
remain
in
the

and
be
lost
in
case
cream
is

to
improve
the

of

recipes
for
cheese
dishes
effect
of
cooking
on
cheese
because
cheese
is
a
highly
concentrated
food
it
is
generally
considered
to
be
indigestible
but
this
matter
can
be
remedied
by
mixing
the
cheese
with
other
foods
and
thus
separating
it
into
small
particles
that
are
more
readily
digested
the
way
in
which
this
may
be
done
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
cheese
any
of
the
dry
cheeses
or
any
of
the
moist
cheeses
that
have
become
dry
may
be
grated
or
broken
into
bits
but
as
it
is
difficult
to
treat
the
moist
ones
in
this
way
they
must
be
brought
to
a
liquid
state
by
means
of
heat
before
they
can
be
added
to
other
foods
the
cooking
of
cheese
however
has
an
effect
on
this
food
that
should
be
thoroughly
understood
it
will
be
well
to
note
therefore
that
the
application
of
heat
to
the
form
of
protein
found
in
cheese
causes
this
food
substance
to
coagulate
and
harden
as
in
the
case
of
the
albumen
of
eggs
in
the
process
of
coagulation
the
first
effect
is
the
melting
of
the
cheese
and
when
it
has
been
brought
to
this
semiliquid
state
it
can
be
easily
combined
with
other
foods
such
as
milk
eggs
soups
and
sauces
in
forming
such
combinations
the
addition
of
a
small
amount
of
bicarbonate
of
soda
helps
to
blend
the
foods
another
characteristic
of
cheese
that
influences
the
cooking
of
it
is
that
the
fat
it
contains
melts
only
at
a
low
temperature
so
that
on
the
whole
the
methods
of
preparation
that
require
a
low
temperature
are
the
best
for
cooking
these
foods
however
a
precaution
that
should
be
taken
whenever
cheese
is
heated
is
not
to
cook
it
too
long
for
long
cooking
makes
it
hard
and
leathery
in
consistency
and
cheese
in
this
state
is
difficult
to
digest

already
been

cheese
lends
itself
very
readily
to

variety
of
cooked

for
instance
it
may
be
grated
and

or
creamed
potatoes
and
then
browned
by
placing
the

may
be
arranged
between
the
layers
of

other

in
the

a

of

in

description
of
eggs
and
place
in
the
diet
eggs
are
of
great
importance
in
the
diet
and
to
appreciate
this
fact
fully
the
true
nature
of
this
food
must
be
understood
for
domestic
use
the
eggs
of
guinea
hens
turkeys
ducks
and
geese
occasionally
find
favor
but
as
eggs
laid
by
hens
are
the
kind
that
is
commonly
used
it
is
to
such
eggs
that
this
section
is
devoted
a
hen
egg
may
really
be
considered
as
an
undeveloped
chicken
because
it
contains
all
the
elements
required
to
build
the
body
of
the
chick
and
provide
it
with
the
energy
it
needs
to
pick
its
way
into
the
world
when
it
emerges
from
the
shell
it
is
fully
developed
and
in
a
short
time
it
begins
an
independent
existence
seeking
and
finding
its
own
food
the
fact
that
eggs
store
so
much
nutritive
material
explains
to
some
extent
why
they
are
a
valuable
source
of
food
for
man
and
why
they
are
used
so
extensively
however
as
in
the
case
of
milk
the
elements
that
eggs
contain
are
not
in
just
the
right
proportion
for
the
sole
nourishment
of
a
human
being
so
they
must
generally
be
used
in
combination
with
other
foods
most
persons
are
familiar
with
the
appearance
of
eggs
but
in
order
that
satisfactory
results
may
be
obtained
in
their
selection
care
and
cooking
it
will
be
necessary
to
look
into
the
details
of
their
composition
as
is
well
known
an
egg
consists
of
a
porous
shell
lined
with
a
fine
but
tough
membrane
that
encloses
the
white
and
the
yolk
and
serves
to
protect
them
the
yolk
is
divided
from
the
white
by
a
delicate
membrane
which
permits
it
to
be
separated
from
the
white
when
an
egg
is
carefully
broken
this
membrane
extends
to
each
end
of
the
shell
in
the
form
of
a
small
cord
and
it
is
so
fastened
to
the
shell
as
to
hold
the
yolk
evenly
suspended
the
porous
nature
of
an
egg
shell
is
required
to
give
air
to
the
developing
chick
but
it
is
this
characteristic
that
permits
eggs
to
spoil
as
they
grow
old
and
are
exposed
to
air
for
through
these
minute
pores
or
openings
the
water
in
the
egg
evaporates
and
air
and
bacteria
enter
of
course
as
the
water
evaporates
and
is
replaced
by
air
the
egg
becomes
lighter
because
of
this
fact
the
freshness
of
eggs
can
be
determined
by
placing
them
in
water
when
they
are
fresh
they
will
sink
in
cold
water
but
as
they
decompose
they
become
lighter
and
will
float
since
it
is
known
that
the
spoiling
of
eggs
is
due
to
the
entrance
of
air
through
the
porous
shell
it
may
be
inferred
that
their
decay
may
be
prevented
either
by
protecting
the
shell
so
that
air
can
not
enter
or
by
keeping
the
eggs
at
so
low
a
temperature
that
bacteria
can
not
grow
although
stored
eggs
always
deteriorate
more
or
less
both
of
these
methods
of
preservation
have
proved
very
satisfactory
the
former
being
used
largely
in
the
home
and
the
latter
finding
its
solution
in
cold
storage
a
knowledge
of
how
eggs
can
be
preserved
however
is
of
great
value
for
if
there
were
no
means
of
preservation
and
eventual
marketing
the
price
of
eggs
would
at
times
rise
to
actual
prohibitive
limits
that
eggs
as
an
article
of
food
are
growing
in
importance
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
their
production
has
come
to
be
a
large
and
widely
distributed
industry
owing
to
the
private
consumption
and
sale
of
eggs
an
accurate
statement
of
the
number
of
eggs
produced
is
difficult
to
give
still
in
a
report
the
united
states
bureau
of
agriculture
estimated
the
value
of
the
yearly
egg
production
at
something
more
than
three
million
dollars
with
an
allowance
of
about
eggs
or
dozen
per
capita
each
year
or
eggs
a
week
for
each
person
these
figures
however
are
only
suggestive
of
the
production
use
and
value
of
eggs
for
as
the
population
increases
so
does
the
use
of
eggs
in
fact
they
are
proving
to
be
almost
indispensable
to
the
cook
the
baker
the
manufacturers
of
certain
foods
and
many
others
with
the
increase
in
the
demand
for
eggs
has
come
a
corresponding
steady
advance
in
the
money
value
of
this
product
and
consequently
an
increase
in
its
price
the
housewife
who
would
practice
economy
in
cookery
can
readily
see
therefore
that
with
reference
to
the
number
of
eggs
required
and
the
ways
in
which
they
are
used
she
must
choose
carefully
the
recipes
and
methods
she
employs
if
the
eggs
are
always
considered
a
part
of
a
meal
their
use
is
seldom
an
extravagance
even
at
such
high
prices
as
they
sometimes
attain
on
the
other
hand
if
a
dessert
that
requires
the
use
of
many
eggs
is
added
to
a
meal
that
is
itself
sufficient
in
food
value
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
regard
such
use
of
eggs
as
an
extravagance
a
point
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
the
use
of
eggs
in
the
diet
especially
when
their
price
seems
very
high
is
that
there
is
no
waste
matter
in
them
unless
the
shell
is
regarded
as
waste
therefore
they
are
often
more
economical
than
other
foods
that
can
be
bought
for
less
money
it
must
not
be
understood
however
that
eggs
are
used
only
as
an
article
of
diet
they
are
also
a
very
important
food
ingredient
being
employed
in
the
preparation
of
many
kinds
of
dishes
for
instance
they
are
often
used
to
thicken
custards
sauces
etc
to
clarify
soups
and
jellies
to
lighten
cakes
puddings
hot
breads
and
other
baked
mixtures
to
form
the
basis
for
salad
dressings
and
to
combine
or
hold
together
many
varieties
of
food
nutritive
value
of
eggs
like
milk
eggs
are
often
spoken
of
as
a
perfect
food
still
as
has
been
pointed
out
they
are
not
a
perfect
food
for
man
but
they
are
of
especial
nutritive
value
and
should
be
used
freely
in
the
diet
just
as
long
as
their
cost
neither
limits
nor
prohibits
their
use
an
idea
of
how
they
compare
with
other
nutritious
foods
can
be
obtained
from
fig
which
shows
that
eight
eggs
are
equal
in
food
value
to
quart
of
milk
or
pound
and
ounces
of
beefsteak
a
better
understanding
of
their
food
value
however
can
be
gained
from
a
study
of
their
composition
illustration
fig
since
an
egg
is
an
undeveloped
chick
that
requires
only
the
addition
of
warmth
to
develop
it
into
a
living
moving
creature
made
of
muscles
bones
and
blood
it
is
evident
that
this
food
contains
considerable
and
material
the
exact
proportion
of
this
material
as
well
as
the
other
substances
found
in
eggs
is
given
in
the
food
chart
shown
in
of
part
the
chart
relating
to
the
composition
of
eggs
points
out
that
the
edible
portion
of
the
whole
egg
consists
of
per
cent
of
water
per
cent
of
protein
per
cent
of
fat
and
about
per
cent
of
ash
or
mineral
matter
the
protein
which
is
chiefly
in
the
form
of
albumen
and
the
fat
are
the
most
digestible
of
these
elements
while
the
mineral
constituents
are
as
valuable
for
the
growing
child
as
for
the
chick
when
the
total
weight
of
an
egg
is
taken
into
consideration
the
shell
constitutes
about
per
the
yolk
per
and
the
white
per
cent
the
composition
of
the
yolk
and
the
white
differs
somewhat
the
yolk
having
the
greater
food
value
a
fact
that
is
also
clearly
indicated
in
the
chart
the
white
contains
a
larger
proportion
of
water
than
the
yolk
but
the
yolk
contains
the
most
of
the
fat
and
more
protein
and
mineral
matter
or
ash
than
the
white
in
addition
the
chart
shows
that
the
number
of
calories
to
the
pound
of
whole
egg
is
of
egg
yolk
is
and
of
egg
white
is
protein
in
the
nature
of
the
food
substances
in
eggs
is
of
nearly
as
great
importance
as
their
amount
for
they
not
only
determine
the
value
of
this
food
in
the
body
but
influence
its
cooking
that
protein
is
present
in
both
the
yolk
and
the
white
is
apparent
from
the
fact
that
they
coagulate
when
heat
is
applied
because
eggs
are
high
in
protein
containing
per
cent
of
this
substance
they
may
be
regarded
as
equivalent
to
a
meat
dish
and
it
is
only
when
they
are
extremely
high
in
price
that
they
can
not
be
frequently
substituted
for
meat
to
advantage
they
are
often
used
to
take
the
place
of
milk
too
for
eggs
and
milk
are
more
alike
in
nutritive
value
than
any
other
two
protein
foods
but
of
the
two
milk
yields
the
cheaper
form
of
protein
like
meat
and
milk
eggs
are
rich
in
all
those
food
materials
which
enter
into
the
construction
of
bone
muscle
and
blood
fat
in
a
study
of
the
food
chart
previously
mentioned
will
show
that
eggs
contain
proportionately
almost
as
much
fat
as
protein
and
that
nearly
all
this
fat
is
found
in
the
yolk
since
fat
produces
more
heat
or
energy
weight
for
weight
than
any
other
food
substance
and
since
eggs
contain
neither
starch
nor
sugar
it
is
evident
that
the
fat
of
this
food
is
the
main
source
of
the
material
fat
in
eggs
occurs
in
the
form
of
an
emulsion
or
tiny
particles
and
like
the
fat
of
milk
is
very
readily
digested
it
is
for
this
reason
that
both
of
these
foods
are
particularly
well
adapted
to
the
diet
of
both
children
and
adults
the
presence
of
quantities
of
protein
and
fat
and
the
absence
of
carbohydrate
in
eggs
indicate
that
the
proper
thing
to
combine
with
this
food
in
order
to
have
a
meal
when
eggs
are
eaten
is
carbohydrate
in
some
form
minerals
in
eggs
are
especially
valuable
for
the
mineral
salts
they
contain
chief
among
which
are
lime
phosphorus
sulphur
iron
potassium
and
sodium
for
this
reason
the
addition
of
eggs
to
any
kind
of
diet
supplies
a
large
amount
of
the
minerals
that
are
needed
for
bone
blood
and
tissue
building
a
favorable
point
concerning
the
minerals
found
in
eggs
is
that
they
are
not
affected
to
any
extent
by
cooking
therefore
in
the
preparation
of
any
dish
if
eggs
are
added
to
other
foods
that
dish
will
contain
an
additional
amount
of
mineral
salts
plus
the
nutritive
value
of
the
eggs
digestibility
of
in
connection
with
the
discussion
of
the
food
substances
of
which
eggs
are
composed
it
will
be
well
to
note
how
these
affect
the
digestibility
of
this
food
but
just
what
is
meant
by
this
characteristic
with
reference
to
eggs
must
first
be
understood
in
some
foods
digestibility
may
mean
the
length
of
time
required
for
them
to
digest
in
others
the
completeness
of
the
digestion
and
in
still
others
the
ease
and
comfort
with
which
the
process
of
digestion
proceeds
in
the
case
of
eggs
digestibility
refers
to
the
quantity
of
this
food
that
is
absorbed
that
is
actually
dissolved
and
permitted
to
enter
the
blood
stream
the
nutritive
value
of
eggs
is
not
so
high
as
would
naturally
be
supposed
for
although
the
protein
fat
and
mineral
salts
of
an
egg
make
up
about
of
its
contents
one
egg
equals
in
nutritive
value
only
cupful
of
milk
a
small
potato
or
a
apple
however
when
the
proportion
of
the
nutritive
material
that
the
body
retains
from
this
food
or
its
digestibility
is
considered
eggs
rank
extremely
high
it
having
been
determined
by
experiments
that
per
cent
of
the
protein
and
per
cent
of
the
fat
are
assimilated
a
point
worthy
of
note
in
this
connection
though
is
that
eggs
contain
no
cellulose
such
as
that
found
in
grains
vegetables
and
fruits
therefore
in
order
to
add
the
bulk
to
the
diet
foods
that
do
contain
cellulose
should
be
served
with
eggs
whether
or
not
the
cooking
of
eggs
has
any
effect
on
their
digestibility
is
a
matter
that
has
also
been
investigated
the
results
of
the
experiments
made
indicate
that
cooking
makes
some
difference
with
the
rate
of
digestion
but
very
little
with
its
thoroughness
so
far
as
the
rapidity
of
digestion
is
concerned
there
is
very
little
difference
between
raw
eggs
and
slightly
cooked
eggs
but
eggs
although
they
may
be
digested
as
completely
as
ones
require
longer
time
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
process
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
whites
of
eggs
are
so
firm
in
texture
that
unless
they
are
finely
chopped
or
thoroughly
masticated
the
digestive
juices
are
not
able
to
act
on
them
quickly
as
a
result
portions
of
them
may
escape
digestion
or
remain
in
the
digestive
tract
for
some
time
and
decompose
for
this
reason
eggs
are
usually
excluded
from
the
diet
of
children
and
invalids
and
even
healthy
adults
should
be
careful
to
masticate
them
thoroughly
selection
of
eggs
on
first
thought
it
would
seem
as
if
there
is
very
little
to
guide
the
housewife
in
the
selection
of
eggs
it
being
extremely
difficult
to
tell
from
their
external
appearance
whether
or
not
they
are
fresh
or
stale
as
a
rule
she
must
trust
largely
to
the
honesty
of
the
person
from
whom
she
buys
eggs
still
she
need
not
depend
entirely
on
the
dealer
word
for
at
least
to
a
certain
extent
there
are
ways
in
which
she
may
judge
the
quality
of
eggs
because
of
the
great
value
of
eggs
as
a
food
and
for
cooking
purposes
it
is
important
that
the
housewife
make
use
of
all
available
information
on
this
matter
and
in
addition
become
familiar
with
the
trade
practices
in
the
egg
industry
marketing
of
as
is
generally
known
hens
lay
a
large
number
of
eggs
in
the
spring
of
the
year
but
they
do
not
lay
readily
in
the
cold
winter
months
and
not
alone
are
the
greatest
quantities
of
eggs
produced
in
april
and
may
but
those
laid
at
this
time
are
of
the
best
quality
because
of
this
condition
and
in
order
that
the
demand
during
the
time
of
scarcity
may
be
supplied
it
is
necessary
that
a
considerable
number
of
eggs
be
preserved
when
they
are
comparatively
cheap
and
abundant
also
in
the
preserving
of
eggs
for
future
use
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
that
they
be
kept
in
the
best
possible
condition
and
manner
so
that
when
they
are
used
months
after
they
are
laid
they
may
be
as
good
as
it
is
possible
to
have
them
the
advance
made
in
storage
and
transportation
methods
in
recent
years
has
done
much
toward
making
the
egg
supply
uniform
all
the
year
around
not
long
ago
because
of
inadequate
means
of
storage
and
shipping
eggs
were
sold
only
a
short
distance
from
the
place
where
they
were
produced
however
with
the
coming
of
cold
storage
and
improved
methods
of
shipping
eggs
have
been
changed
from
a
perishable
and
more
or
less
seasonable
food
to
a
staple
one
now
it
is
possible
to
collect
them
in
large
quantities
to
keep
them
for
a
considerable
time
before
selling
them
and
to
ship
them
long
distances
to
safeguard
the
public
though
authorities
have
set
a
time
limit
for
the
storage
of
eggs
the
legal
time
they
may
be
kept
being
months
by
this
is
meant
that
eggs
placed
in
the
warehouse
in
may
must
be
released
or
sold
in
december
whereas
those
stored
in
june
must
be
released
no
later
than
january
eggs
that
have
been
kept
too
long
in
storage
are
characterized
by
a
musty
odor
and
flavor
the
breaking
of
the
yolk
and
its
mixing
with
the
white
and
a
watery
condition
of
the
white
such
eggs
of
course
can
not
be
sold
legally
those
which
may
be
placed
on
the
market
are
graded
according
to
their
freshness
cleanliness
size
cracks
and
color
with
the
exception
of
their
freshness
these
points
can
be
readily
told
from
the
appearance
of
the
eggs
but
in
order
to
determine
whether
an
egg
is
fresh
or
not
it
is
generally
put
through
a
process
known
as
by
which
the
interior
condition
of
the
egg
can
be
ascertained
in
the
grading
of
eggs
all
those
of
the
best
size
color
and
condition
are
sold
under
a
particular
trade
name
and
bring
a
high
or
a
low
price
according
to
the
grading
others
that
are
not
so
perfect
are
put
in
another
grade
and
sell
for
prices
that
vary
according
to
the
demand
eggs
of
course
differ
in
appearance
and
in
many
cases
they
are
sorted
in
order
to
satisfy
the
demand
for
instance
in
some
localities
eggs
having
a
brown
shell
sell
for
the
highest
price
while
in
other
places
eggs
having
a
white
shell
are
in
the
greatest
demand
and
bring
the
highest
price
unsorted
eggs
are
not
held
in
much
favor
and
do
not
bring
so
good
a
price
as
those
which
are
all
one
color
many
persons
have
an
idea
that
the
color
of
the
shell
of
an
egg
bears
some
relation
to
its
nutritive
value
and
flavor
however
authorities
on
foods
agree
that
other
things
being
alike
the
edible
portion
of
eggs
has
essentially
the
same
composition
and
nutritive
value
as
that
of
eggs
quality
of
the
natural
quality
of
eggs
depends
largely
on
the
food
of
the
hens
and
their
conditions
of
living
because
of
this
fact
the
selection
breeding
and
care
of
fowls
have
developed
into
a
science
particularly
since
the
production
of
eggs
has
grown
into
an
industry
when
the
quality
itself
is
to
be
determined
all
the
characteristics
of
eggs
must
be
taken
into
consideration
still
there
is
one
particular
point
on
which
the
quality
of
eggs
depends
and
that
is
their
freshness
various
agencies
however
are
constantly
at
work
to
render
this
quality
inferior
chief
among
these
are
the
molds
and
bacteria
that
pass
through
the
porous
shells
of
eggs
that
have
been
improperly
cared
for
or
have
become
contaminated
by
being
allowed
to
remain
in
unclean
surroundings
such
bacteria
are
responsible
for
the
unpleasant
flavors
that
are
found
in
bad
eggs
because
of
their
harmful
effect
every
effort
should
be
made
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
the
germs
that
cause
decay
and
as
has
been
stated
the
best
way
in
which
to
accomplish
this
is
to
protect
the
shell
if
it
is
found
that
bacteria
have
entered
the
eggs
will
become
unfit
for
use
quickly
unless
their
growth
is
prevented
this
may
be
done
by
storing
the
eggs
at
a
temperature
that
will
keep
the
bacteria
dormant
or
inert
if
the
eggs
are
kept
under
the
proper
conditions
they
will
not
actually
spoil
for
a
long
time
but
it
is
seldom
that
they
are
not
more
or
less
affected
by
storage
of
any
kind
that
covers
a
period
of
several
months
one
change
that
can
always
be
looked
for
in
such
eggs
is
in
the
air
space
at
the
broad
end
when
an
egg
is
first
laid
this
air
space
is
small
but
since
the
water
contained
in
the
egg
slowly
evaporates
through
the
porous
shell
it
increases
in
size
as
the
egg
grows
staler
for
this
reason
the
freshness
of
an
egg
can
often
be
determined
by
the
size
of
this
air
space
in
addition
the
purposes
for
which
eggs
are
used
are
somewhat
affected
by
their
storage
a
stale
egg
although
it
may
not
be
actually
spoiled
to
the
extent
that
it
can
not
be
used
as
food
will
not
produce
such
good
results
in
a
cooking
process
as
a
fresh
egg
especially
if
it
is
used
for
leavening
in
fact
it
is
impossible
to
produce
the
desired
results
with
eggs
that
have
undergone
a
certain
amount
of
change
even
though
their
odor
and
their
flavor
do
not
indicate
that
they
are
spoiled
judging
the
quality
of
eggs
in
the
while
as
has
been
mentioned
the
housewife
must
depend
considerably
on
the
dealer
word
as
to
the
freshness
of
the
eggs
she
purchases
it
will
be
well
for
her
to
be
familiar
with
the
trade
names
of
eggs
and
their
meaning
the
names
used
differ
of
course
in
various
localities
but
all
large
distributors
grade
and
name
eggs
in
much
the
same
way
in
deciding
on
the
grade
to
which
eggs
belong
a
certain
number
of
points
are
given
for
color
size
freshness
and
appearance
and
the
sum
total
of
these
points
determines
the
grade
a
special
name
being
given
for
each
grade
for
instance
eggs
that
can
be
graded
are
called
those
which
receive
a
grade
of
those
which
are
graded
and
those
which
can
be
graded
only
when
eggs
are
put
on
the
market
under
such
names
it
can
be
expected
that
the
quality
will
correspond
to
the
grade
and
the
price
will
vary
with
the
grade
therefore
the
trade
name
and
the
price
are
two
of
the
principal
ways
in
which
the
quality
of
eggs
in
the
market
may
be
judged
another
way
of
judging
the
quality
of
eggs
consists
in
observing
the
condition
of
the
surface
of
the
shell
when
eggs
are
freshly
laid
the
shell
is
covered
with
a
substance
called
that
gives
it
a
feeling
much
like
that
of
a
thin
lime
coating
deposited
in
a
pan
after
water
boils
this
coating
disappears
gradually
as
the
egg
is
exposed
to
the
air
but
as
long
as
it
remains
the
egg
may
be
considered
as
fresh
and
while
this
way
of
determining
freshness
is
probably
the
quickest
it
is
possible
that
the
quality
of
some
eggs
from
which
the
bloom
has
recently
disappeared
has
not
been
injured
when
eggs
are
selected
in
the
market
certain
points
in
their
appearance
should
also
be
noted
if
eggs
of
the
best
quality
are
desired
ones
that
are
uniform
in
size
and
color
should
be
selected
with
regard
to
shape
they
should
have
a
comparatively
long
oval
shell
one
end
of
which
is
blunt
and
the
other
a
sharp
curve

judging
the
quality
of
eggs
in
the
after
eggs
have
been
received
in
the
home
several
simple
tests
for
determining
their
freshness
can
be
applied
in
addition
to
the
ones
already
mentioned
a
rather
indefinite
test
but
one
that
is
sometimes
applied
to
determine
the
freshness
of
an
egg
is
to
shake
it
however
to
be
able
to
carry
out
this
test
successfully
it
is
well
to
understand
the
interior
structure
of
an
egg

previously
mentioned

the
spiral

the

end
of

the

the

and
at
the

the

the

evaporates

so
much
that
they
can
be
felt
moving
from
side
to
side
when
the
egg
is
shaken
the
staler
the
egg
the
more
pronounced

the
movement
become
this
method
should
be
applied
only
immediately
before
the
egg
is
to
be
used
as
the
thin
membrane
between
the
yolk
and
the
white
and
the
spiral
cords
that
hold
up
the
yolk
are
liable
to
be
disturbed
by
the
shaking
if
they
are
broken
the
yolk
will
settle
and
finally
adhere
to
the
shell

the
egg

in
placing

a

the

an
egg
that
is

old
will
sink
into

until
only
a
slight
portion
of

if
the
egg
is

or
stale
it
will

nearly

the
test
known
as
candling
which
is
usually
applied
to
eggs
before
they
are
put
on
the
market
can
also
be
practiced
by
the
housewife
in
the
home
this
method
of
determining
the
freshness
of
eggs
consists
in
placing
a
piece
of
cardboard
containing
a
hole
a
little
smaller
than
an
egg
between
the
eye
and
a
light
which
may
be
from
a
lamp
a

an
electric
light

how
an

at

an
egg

it
will
appear
as

that
is
the
yolk
will
be
barely
distinguishable
from
the
white
except
as
a
slightly
darker
area
in
the
center
of
the
egg
and
the
entire
egg
will
appear
clear
and
bright
and
free
from
spots
in
an
egg
that
is
a
little
older
candling
will
reveal
a
slightly
darker
yolk
a
cloudy
white
and
a
larger
air
space
as
in
in
a
watery
egg
or
one
that
is
beginning
to
spoil
various
dark
spots
and
blotches
usually
develop
as
view
indicates
when
an
egg
is
rotten
the
contents
of
the
shell
will
look
dark
in
candling
and
the
yolk
will
appear
to
be
mixed
with
the
white
as
in
if
the
housewife
does
not
wish
to
resort
to
candling
she
may
determine
the
condition
of
an
egg
by
breaking
it
into
a
saucer
and
examining
it
carefully
if
the
egg
is
newly
laid
no
odor
will
be
detected
and
the
white
will
be
clear
elastic
and
rather
thick
also
where
it
joins
the
yolk
it
will
be
almost
solid
the
yolk
of
such
an
egg
will
have
an
even
yellow
color
without
lighter
or
darker
spots
and
as
shown
in
fig
will
stand
up
well
from
the
surface
of
the
white
sometimes
a
small
spot
of
blood
may
be
detected
on
the
yolk
of
a
perfectly
fresh
egg
but
while
this
is
not
pleasant
to
look
at
it
does
not
affect
the
quality
of
the
egg
when
an
egg
that
is
not
real
fresh
is
broken
into
a
saucer
the
yolk
will
lie
flat
as
in
in
an
egg
that
is
quite
stale
the
membrane
surrounding
the
yolk
is
easily
destroyed
so
that
even
when
such
an
egg
is
broken
carefully
the
yolk
and
the
white
are
likely
to
run
together
preservation
of
eggs
causes
and
prevention
of
deterioration
as
has
been
implied
in
the
discussion
given
thus
far
eggs
will
deteriorate
or
spoil
in
a
comparatively
short
time
unless
something
is
done
to
preserve
them
in
view
of
the
eggs
she
keeps
on
hand
at
home
as
well
as
those
she
buys
the
causes
of
spoiling
and
the
ways
in
which
to
prevent
spoiling
are
matters
with
which
the
housewife
should
be
familiar
particularly
if
she
would
secure
for
her
family
eggs
of
the
best
quality
at
prices
that
are
not
beyond
her
means
the
spoiling
of
eggs
is
due
to
decomposition
which
is
caused
by
molds
or
bacteria
that
result
from
accidental
causes
and
in
fertile
eggs
to
the
germination
and
development
of
the
chick
which
is
a
natural
process
the
loss
of
quality
resulting
from
molds
and
bacteria
in
the
egg
is
brought
about
by
their
growth
and
by
the
formation
of
chemical
compounds
which
give
spoiled
eggs
their
peculiar
appearance
taste
and
odor
some
of
these
molds
are
not
injurious
to
health
while
others
may
give
rise
to
more
or
less
serious
illness
various
methods
have
been
devised
whereby
their
rapid
deterioration
may
be
prevented
and
a
knowledge
of
these
is
important
to
those
who
have
occasion
to
purchase
eggs
or
to
keep
them
over
from
the
season
of
plenty
to
the
season
of
scarcity
the
method
followed
to
prevent
losses
due
to
the
development
of
the
embryo
consists
in
the
production
of
infertile
eggs
that
is
eggs
that
are
this
is
a
point
that
is
as
well
worth
remembering
in
the
home
production
of
eggs
as
it
is
in
professional
poultry
raising
the
method
employed
to
prevent
the
infection
of
eggs
by
molds
and
bacteria
is
to
keep
them
clean
and
dry
from
the
time
they
are
laid
until
they
are
finally
used
while
the
preservation
of
eggs
is
carried
on
to
a
greater
extent
at
present
than
formerly
the
idea
is
neither
new
nor
original
indeed
it
has
been
practiced
for
many
years
by
the
people
of
some
foreign
countries
for
instance
in
some
sections
of
china
duck
eggs
are
preserved
by
covering
them
with
a
layer
of
mud
and
such
eggs
are
often
kept
for
a
year
or
more
before
they
are
eaten
however
eggs
stored
in
this
way
decompose
and
their
odor
and
flavor
disappear
before
they
are
used
so
that
they
must
usually
be
hard
boiled
before
they
can
be
eaten
egg
preservation
such
as
is
practiced
in
the
united
states
is
the
opposite
of
this
and
attempts
to
prevent
not
only
ripening
processes
and
putrefactive
changes
but
any
bacterial
or
other
changes
that
lessen
the
original
quality
it
will
be
well
to
note
however
that
eggs
preserved
for
any
length
of
time
deteriorate
to
some
extent
and
can
not
be
expected
to
be
equally
as
good
as
fresh
eggs
commercial
preservation
of
eggs
the
usual
market
method
of
preserving
eggs
is
by
cold
storage
an
industry
that
has
developed
to
vast
proportions
in
recent
years
the
success
of
this
method
depends
on
the
fact
that
germs
causing
decomposition
will
not
live
in
a
low
temperature
while
the
plan
of
storing
eggs
is
responsible
for
their
high
price
at
certain
times
it
is
also
a
means
of
supplying
eggs
to
many
persons
who
would
otherwise
not
be
able
to
obtain
them
the
greatest
point
in
favor
of
this
plan
however
is
that
it
makes
possible
the
marketing
of
quantities
of
eggs
during
the
winter
season
of
scarcity
at
a
price
that
although
somewhat
high
at
times
is
much
more
moderate
than
it
would
be
if
it
were
not
possible
to
store
eggs
in
large
quantities
in
order
that
advantage
may
be
taken
of
favorable
climatic
conditions
eggs
are
commonly
purchased
for
storage
as
early
in
the
year
as
they
are
abundant
they
are
selected
with
great
care
only
those
which
are
clean
sound
and
fresh
being
used
these
eggs
are
packed
in
clean
cases
and
then
placed
in
warehouses
where
they
are
kept
at
a
temperature
just
above
freezing
or
one
that
ranges
from
to
degrees
fahrenheit
in
such
storage
precaution
is
usually
taken
to
prevent
the
eggs
from
freezing
for
while
freezing

preservation
of

the
housewife
who
desires
to
run
her
household
on
an
economical
basis
will
not
depend
entirely
on
eggs
that
are
commercially
stored
but
will
take
advantage
of
one
of
the
many
methods
by
which
eggs
may
be
successfully
kept
in
the
home
by
being
prudent
in
this
matter
she
will
be
prepared
to
supply
her
family
with
this
commodity
at
times
when
the
market
price
is
high
as
many
as
twenty
household
methods
have
been
tried
out
for
the
preserving
of
eggs
but
each
one
is
based
on
the
theory
that
decay
is
hindered
when
the
shell
is
covered
with
some
substance
that
renders
it
and
prevents
evaporation
or
the
entrance
of
bacteria
and
mold
among
the
methods
that
have
met
with
the
most
success
are
burying
eggs
in
oats
bran
or
salt
rubbing
them
with
fat
dipping
them
in
melted
paraffin
covering
them
with
varnish
or
shellac
and
putting
them
down
in
lime
water
or
in
a
solution
of
water
glass
no
matter
which
of
these
methods
is
adopted
however
it
will
be
well
to
note
that
only
eggs
laid
in
april
may
or
june
should
be
used
for
storage
purposes
as
these
are
the
best
ones
laid
during
the
year
also
that
the
eggs
should
always
be
packed
with
the
small
end
down
because
the
yolk
will
not
settle
toward
the
small
end
so
readily
as
toward
the
large
end
or
the
side
of
these
various
ways
of
preserving
eggs
in
the
home
probably
the
oldest
method
is
that
of
packing
the
eggs
in
oats
bran
or
salt
this
method
is
fairly
effective
but
the
eggs
preserved
by
it
do
not
keep
so
long
as
eggs
preserved
by
other
methods
nor
is
their
quality
so
good
preserving
eggs
by
completely
covering
the
shells
with
fat
vaseline
paraffin
varnish
or
other
substance
that
will
exclude
the
air
but
not
impart
flavor
to
the
eggs
proves
a
more
satisfactory
method
so
far
as
the
eggs
are
concerned
but
it
requires
more
time
and
handling
to
assist
in
their
preservation
eggs
are
sometimes
immersed
in
boiling
water
for
to
seconds
this
process
which
causes
the
white
to
harden
slightly
just
inside
of
the
shell
keeps
the
eggs
fairly
well
but
it
is
rather
difficult
to
accomplish
as
the
least
overcooking
renders
the
egg
unfit
for
use
as
a
raw
egg
as
a
result
of
many
trials
it
has
been
found
that
putting
eggs
down
in
the
various
solutions
that
are
used
for
this
purpose
is
the
most
effective
way
of
preserving
them
under
home
conditions
provided
of
course
the
solutions
in
which
the
eggs
are
immersed
do
not
flavor
the
eggs

exterior
condition
of
as
has
been
explained
clean
eggs
are
the
most
desirable
but
it
is
not
advisable
to
wash
eggs
that
are
to
be
kept
for
even
a
short
time
as
washing
them
removes
the
natural
coating
that
helps
to
prevent
the
entrance
of

however
as
it
is
necessary
that
the
shells
be
perfectly
clean
before
they
are
broken
or
before
the
eggs
are
cooked
the
eggs
may
be
washed
or
wiped
with
a
damp
cloth
immediately
before
such
processes
breaking
of
in
cookery
it
is
usually
desirable
to
break
an
egg
shell
so
that
the
yolk
will
not
run
into
the
white
that
is
so
that
these
can
be
kept
separate
while
there
are
several
methods
of
doing
this
the
housewife
should
adopt
the
one
that
is
most
convenient
for
her
a
quick
method
that
is
often
employed
consists
in
striking
the
shell
on
the
edge
of
the
pan
or
the
bowl
into
which
the
contents
are
to
be
put
a
preferable
method
however
is
illustrated
in
fig
it
consists
in
striking
one
side
of
the
shell
midway
between
the
ends
a
sharp
blow
with
the
edge
of
a
knife
the
advantage
of
this
method
will
be
evident
after
a
trial
or
two
for
it
will
be
found
that
the
depth
of
the
cut
made
by
the
knife
can
be
so
gauged
that
there
will
be
little
danger
of
breaking
the
yolk
besides
fragments
of
the
shell
are
not
likely
to
fall
into
the
bowl
or
the
pan

of
frequently
recipes
require
that
the
yolks
and
whites
of
eggs
be
beaten
separately
before
being
added
to
the
other
ingredients
when
this
is
the
case
care
must
be
exercised
in
taking
the
egg
from
the
shell
the
method
by
which
this
is
most
easily
accomplished
is
illustrated
in
fig
as
will
be
observed
the
shell
is
first
broken
as
nearly
as
possible
into
halves
and
then
while
the
egg
is
poured
from
of
the
shell
into
the
other
the
white
is
dropped
into
a
dish
and
the
yolk
is
retained
in
the
shell
during
this
process
the
yolk
should
remain
intact
in
its
delicate
membrane
for
if
it
becomes
mixed
with
the
white
the
lightness
of
the
white
will
be
injured
to
separate
the
yolk
from
the
white
is
not
difficult
when
eggs
are
fresh
but
as
they
become
stale
the
membrane
surrounding
the
yolk
grows
weak
and
breaks
easily
if
the
yolk
breaks
and
any
of
it
falls
into
the
white
it
must
be
completely
removed
before
the
white
is
beaten
beating
of
sometimes
eggs
are
cooked
in
the
shell
and
other
times
they
are
used
alone
just
as
they
are
removed
from
the
shell
as
in
the
frying
and
poaching
processes
however
when
they
are
to
be
combined
with
other
ingredients
they
are
usually
beaten
eggs
are
beaten
for
the
purpose
of
mixing
the
yolk
and
the
white
or
of
incorporating
air
to
act
as
a
leavening
agent
when
the
eggs
are
heated
in
the
cooking
process
various
utensils
such
as
a
fork
an
egg
whip
or
an
egg
beater
may
be
employed
for
beating
eggs
the
one
to
select
depending
on
the
use
to
which
the
eggs
are
to
be
put
the
rotary
or
dover
egg
beater
previously
described
as
a
device
and
illustrated
in
fig
should
be
used
to
beat
either
whole
eggs
or
the
yolks
of
eggs
when
they
are
to
be
used
in
custards
mayonnaise
cakes
puddings
as
it
will
beat
them
sufficiently
light
for
such
purposes
however
for
the
beating
of
egg
whites
use
should
be
made
of
a
fork
or
of
an
egg
whip
similar
to
that
shown
in
because
the
whites
must
be
lifted
instead
of
stirred
for
the
incorporation
of
air
and
it
is
only
with
a
utensil
of
this
kind
that
this
can
be
accomplished
then
too
more
air
can
be
incorporated
into
the
whites
and
the
volume
of
the
egg
thereby
increased
by
means
of
a
fork
or
an
egg
whip
than
by
an
egg
beater
an
important
point
to
remember
in
this
connection
is
that
eggs
can
be
beaten
more
successfully
when
they
are
cold
and
have
had
a
pinch
of
salt
added
to
them
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
in
the
beating
of
eggs
it
should
be
remembered
that
for
some
purposes
as
in
making
some
kinds
of
sponge
cake
they
are
beaten
until
nearly
frothy
as
shown
in
fig
when
they
do
not
stand
up
nor
cling
to
the
whip
whereas
for
other
purposes
as
in
making
meringue
they
are
beaten
until
they
are
stiff
enough
to
stand
up
well
and
to
adhere
to
the
whip
as
fig
shows
when
egg
whites
are
to
be
beaten
stiff
care
should
be
taken
not
to
continue
the
beating
too
long
if
this
is
done
they
will
become
dry
and
will
break
up
into
small
pieces
a
condition
that
will
mean
a
loss
of
some
of
the
air
that
has
been
incorporated
it
is
well
also
to
observe
that
egg
whites
should
always
be
beaten
in
the
same
direction
and
that
the
same
motion
should
be
continued
throughout
the
beating
for
a
change
of
direction
or
motion
always
causes
a
loss
of
air
a
final
precaution
to
take
is
never
to
allow
egg
whites
to
stand
after
they
are
beaten
if
this
is
done
the
leavening
power
of
the
eggs
is
reduced
because
the
air
soon
escapes
from
beaten
eggs
and
leaves
underneath
them
a
clear
liquid
that
can
never
be
beaten
up
for
instance
eggs
that
are
to
be
used
for
boiled
icing
should
not
be
beaten
until
the
sirup
has
finished
boiling
however
eggs
that
have
been
separated
but
not
beaten
may
stand
for
a
couple
of
hours
provided
they
are
covered
and
kept
in
a
cool
place
illustration
fig
points
to
observe
in
cooking
eggs
as
has
been
previously
stated
the
substance
in
eggs
that
requires
special
care
in
the
cooking
process
is
the
protein
which
occurs
in
this
food
in
the
form
of
albumen
because
of
this
certain
points
concerning
the
treatment
that
the
albumen
requires
should
be
kept
in
mind
in
a
raw
egg
the
albumen
occurs
in
a
semiliquid
form
but
it
coagulates
at
a
lower
temperature
than
does
the
yolk
which
contains
a
high
percentage
of
fat
after
coagulation
the
consistency
of
the
two
parts
is
very
different
the
white
is
elastic
and
more
or
less
tough
while
the
yolk
upon
being
thoroughly
cooked
becomes
powdery
or
mealy
and
breaks
up
into
minute
particles
the
egg
white
begins
to
coagulate
at
degrees
fahrenheit
and
it
becomes
white
and
jellylike
at
degrees
bringing
an
egg
to
such
a
temperature
produces
a
more
desirable
result
than
cooking
it
at
a
high
temperature
boiling
point
for
instance
because
the
albumen
instead
of
becoming
tough
as
it
does
at
a
high
temperature
acquires
a
soft
tender
consistency
that
exists
throughout
the
entire
egg
an
egg
cooked
in
this
way
is
more
digestible
and
appetizing
than
one
that
is
boiled
until
it
becomes
hard
and
tough
the
low
temperature
at
which
eggs
will
cook
in
the
shell
applies
also
to
eggs
when
they
are
combined
with
other
foods
sometimes
however
a
mixture
in
which
eggs
are
one
of
the
ingredients
must
be
cooked
at
a
high
temperature
because
the
materials
mixed
with
them
require
it
this
difficulty
can
be
overcome
when
eggs
are
combined
with
starchy
foods
such
as
corn
starch
rice
and
tapioca
that
require
long
cooking
in
such
a
case
all
the
ingredients
except
the
eggs
may
be
cooked
the
length
of
time
they
require
after
which
the
eggs
may
be
added
so
that
they
will
cook
just
long
enough
to
become
coagulated
longer
cooking
is
liable
to
spoil
the
texture
often
the
starchy
mixture
retains
sufficient
heat
to
set
the
eggs
without
further
cooking
after
they
are
added
a
very
nutritious
way
in
which
to
prepare
eggs
when
they
are
to
be
used
for
a
dessert
is
to
combine
them
with
milk
to
form
a
custard
which
after
being
sweetened
and
flavored
is
baked
the
proportion
that
has
been
accepted
as
ideal
to
produce
a
dessert
of
the
right
thickness
is
one
egg
to
each
cupful
of
milk
however
an
entire
egg
is
not
always
required
as
one
yolk
is
often
sufficient
to
thicken
cupful
of
milk
care
should
be
taken
in
the
cooking
of
such
custards
for
if
they
are
cooked
too
long
or
at
too
high
a
temperature
they
will
curdle
and
whey
whereas
a
properly
cooked
custard
that
is
one
cooked
slowly
at
a
low
temperature
and
for
the
required
length
of
time
will
have
a
smooth
jellylike
consistency
a
slight
variation
in
a
dish
of
this
kind
is
secured
by
reducing
the
number
of
eggs
and
thickening
it
with
corn
starch
or
some
other
starchy
material
while
such
a
mixture
is
not
a
true
custard
it
makes
an
excellent
dessert
in
the
cooking
of
mixtures
containing
eggs
no
utensil
proves
quite
so
satisfactory
as
the
double
boiler
which
has
already
been
explained
and
illustrated
in
fact
it
is
almost
impossible
to
cook
an
egg
mixture
directly
over
the
flame
on
account
of
the
difficulty
encountered
in
preventing
the
eggs
from
curdling
the
low
temperature
at
which
cooking
is
possible
in
the
double
boiler
makes
it
a
comparatively
simple
matter
to
bring
a
mixture
to
the
proper
consistency
without
the
formation
of
curds
still
a
certain
amount
of
precaution
must
be
taken
even
with
a
double
boiler
if
the
degree
of
heat
that
is
reached
in
this
utensil
is
applied
too
long
the
result
will
be
no
more
satisfactory
than
when
mixtures
are
exposed
directly
to
the
heat
and
cooked
at
a
high
temperature
while
every
effort
should
be
made
to
cook
mixtures
containing
eggs
such
as
custards
or
mayonnaise
so
as
to
prevent
curds
from
forming
occasionally
they
will
form
in
spite
of
all
that
can
be
done
however
it
is
sometimes
possible
to
remedy
the
matter
by
placing
the
vessel
at
once
in
cold
water
and
beating
the
mixture
rapidly
with
a
dover
egg
beater
until
the
curds
disappear
the
cold
water
cools
the
mixture
and
prevents
the
formation
of
more
curds
and
the
beating
breaks
up
those
which
have
already
formed
provided
they
are
not
too
hard
in
addition
to
the
uses
already
mentioned
eggs
have
numerous
other
uses
in
cooking
with
which
the
housewife
should
be
familiar
for
instance
slightly
beaten
egg
is
used
to
a
great
extent
to
make
crumbs
or
meal
adhere
to
the
surface
of
croquettes
meat
oysters
etc
that
are
to
be
sautéd
or
fried
in
deep
fat
a
coating
of
this
kind
preventing
the
food
from
becoming
soaked
with
grease
in
addition
egg
is
used
to
stick
flour
together
for
certain
kinds
of
dough
such
as
noodles
then
again
it
is
much
used
to
puff
up
mixtures
and
produce
a
hollow
space
in
them
as
in
popovers
and
cream
puffs
while
such
mixtures
do
not
require
beating
spongy
mixtures
such
as
omelets
and
sponge
cakes
do
in
these
eggs
are
an
important
factor
and
they
must
be
thoroughly
beaten
in
order
to
incorporate
the
air
in
small
bubbles
and
thus
produce
the
desired
texture
serving
of
eggs
the
manner
of
serving
eggs
depends
of
course
on
the
way
in
which
they
are
cooked
one
point
however
that
should
never
be
overlooked
so
far
as
eggs
that
are
to
be
served
hot
is
concerned
is
that
they
should
be
served
immediately
upon
being
prepared
so
that
they
will
not
have
an
opportunity
to
become
cool
before
being
eaten
this
applies
particularly
to
any
spongy
mixture
such
as
puff
omelet
and
soufflé
as
these
dishes
shrink
upon
standing
and
become
less
appetizing
in
both
appearance
and
texture
several
ways
of
serving
eggs
are
in
practice
but
probably
the
most
satisfactory
way
is
to
serve
them
in
egg
cups
in
case
cups
are
used
they
should
be
heated
before
being
placed
on
the
table
as
the
heat
that
they
retain
helps
to
keep
the
eggs
warm
the
eggs
may
be
removed
from
the
shell
into
the
cup
and
eaten
from
the
cup
or
the
unbroken
egg
may
be
placed
point
downwards
in
the
small
end
of
the
cup
a
small
piece
broken
from
the
broad
end
of
the
shell
and
the
egg
then
eaten
from
the
shell
through
the
opening
made
in
it
if
egg
cups
are
not
available
the
eggs
may
be
removed
from
the
shell
and
served
in
small
dessert
dishes
which
also
should
be
heated
many
egg
dishes
are
made
more
attractive
and
appetizing
by
means
of
a
garnish
of
some
kind
small
strips
or
triangular
pieces
of
toast
sprays
of
parsley
celery
leaves
lettuce
and
strips
of
pimiento
are
very
satisfactory
for
this
purpose
if
no
other
garnish
is
desired
just
a
sprinkling
of
paprika
adds
a
touch
of
color
in
connection
with
the
serving
of
eggs
it
will
be
well
to
note
that
they
have
a
tendency
to
adhere
to
china
and
to
discolor
silver
therefore
in
the
washing
of
china
and
the
cleaning
of
silver
that
have
been
used
in
the
serving
of
raw
or
slightly
cooked
eggs
much
care
should
be
exercised
dishes
in
which
eggs
of
this
kind
have
been
served
should
first
be
washed
in
cool
water
in
order
to
remove
all
the
egg
and
then
they
should
be
thoroughly
washed
in
hot
water
if
the
hot
water
is
applied
first
the
heat
will
cause
the
egg
to
coagulate
and
cling
to
the
dishes
silver
that
comes
in
contact
with
eggs
tarnishes
or
becomes
discolored
through
the
action
of
the
sulphur
that
is
found
in
them
just
as
it
does
when
it
is
exposed
to
the
air
dark
spots
that
appear
on
silver
from
this
source
may
be
removed
by
means
of
a
good
silver
cleaner
egg
recipes
to
enable
the
housewife
to
prepare
many
of
the
dishes
already
mentioned
as
well
as
many
other
egg
dishes
a
number
of
recipes
are
here
given
these
recipes
pertain
to
the
cooking
of
eggs
alone
in
various
ways
or
to
dishes
in
which
eggs
are
the
leading
ingredient
there
are
of
course
numerous
other
dishes
in
which
eggs
are
required
such
as
custards
cakes
mayonnaise
but
these
are
omitted
here
as
recipes
for
them
are
included
in
the
lessons
that
pertain
directly
to
them
in
the
first
few
recipes
the
ingredients
are
omitted
and
merely
directions
given
for
the
eggs
themselves
are
practically
the
only
thing
required
especially
so
far
as
the
cooking
is
concerned
however
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
ingredients
are
listed
in
the
usual
manner
and
explicit
directions
then
given
for
carrying
out
the
recipe
or
jellied
eggs
that
are
cooked
soft

may
be
used
for
any
meal
in
which
plain

can
be
served
when
properly
prepared
they
are
both
digestible
and
attractive
and
any
person
who
is
able
to
eat

at
all
can
eat
them
in
this
form
to
prepare

jellied
eggs
first
bring
to
the
boiling
point
sufficient
water
to
cover
well
the
desired
number
of
eggs
which
is
usually
pint
of
water
to
each
egg
then
drop
the
eggs
into
the
water
carefully
remove
the
pan
from
the
fire
place
a
cover
on
it
and
set
it
on
the
back
of
the
stove
where
the
water
will
not
heat
further
nor
cool
too
rapidly
allow
the
eggs
to
remain
in
the
water
for
minutes
when
eggs
cooked
in
this
manner
are
served
they
will
be
found
to
be
the
consistency
of
jelly
all
the
way
through
this
method
of
cooking
is
preferable
to
boiling
them
for
or
minutes
because
boiling
cooks
the
white
just
inside
the
shell
very
hard
while
the
yolk
of
the
egg
remains
liquid
poached
eggs
properly
poached
make
a
very
attractive
breakfast
dish
but
the
poaching
should
be
well
done
in
order
to
have
the
dish
attractive
and
digestible
the
food
value
of
a
plain
poached
egg
is
of
course
identically
the
same
as
that
of
a
a
or
a
raw
egg
eggs
are
usually
poached
in
a
shallow
pan
although
egg
poachers
are
to
be
had
to
poach
eggs
in
a
shallow
pan
pour
into
the
pan
sufficient
water
to
cover
the
eggs
that
are
to
be
cooked
add
a
teaspoonful
of
salt
or
of
vinegar
for
each
pint
of

and
bring
it
to
the

point
remove
the

or
reduce
the

so
that
the

will
cease
to
boil
break
the
eggs
one
at
a

and
then
slide
them
carefully
into
the
water
do
not
allow
the
water
to
boil
after
the
eggs
have
been
added
as
boiling
toughens
the
egg
white
and
in
addition
causes
considerable
loss
by
tearing
it
into
shreds
when
the
eggs
are
set
remove
them
carefully
from
the
water
and
season
them
with

a
convenient
way
to
remove
the

is
to
use
a
large
spoon
that
has
holes
in
the
bowl
for
draining
off
the
water
the
salt

adds
a
quantity
of

and
egg
will
have
a
food
value
of
about
calories
in
preparing
poached
eggs
on

the
usual
custom
is
to
butter
slices
of
freshly
made
toast
moisten
them
with
hot
milk
or
cream
and
place
on
them
freshly
poached
eggs
the

which
are
not
difficult
to
make
too
long

however
should
be
guarded
against
for
it
will
cause
the
protein
in
the

to
become
too
hard
and
to
separate
from

is
taken
in

the

too
much
beating
will
cause
the
loss

precaution
is
that

if

is

to
them

breakfast

so
that
a
definite
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
student
progress
in
cookery
there
is
here
presented
a
breakfast
menu
that
is
to
be
prepared
and
reported
on
at
the
same
time
that
the

questions
are

it

have
already
been

sliced

coffee
in
most
homes
breakfast
is
a
meal
that
is
gathered
together
with
as
little
thought
and
preparation
as
possible
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
housewife
feels
that
she
does
not
wish
to
rise
early
enough
in
the
morning
to
prepare
an
elaborate
menu
breakfast
however
should
be
the
most
attractive
meal
in
the
day
because
it
is
one
that
gives
to
each
member
of
the
family
the
right
start
for
the
day
and
sustains
him
until
luncheon
time
in
most
cases
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
slice
or
two
of
toast
do
not
start
one
with
a
cheerful
attitude
nor
do
they
contain
sufficient
food
value
to
nourish
the
individual
properly
with
a
little
forethought
and
planning
certain
foods
may
be
partly
prepared
for
breakfast
the
day
before
if
this
is
done
the
time
required
for
the
actual
preparation
of
the
breakfast
need
not
be
greatly
increased
for
example
in
the
accompanying
menu
the
cream
of
wheat
may
be
cooked
the
evening
before
the
materials
for
the
graham
muffins
measured
and
even
the
pan
in
which
they
are
to
be
baked
greased
and
the
materials
for
the
omelet
collected
and
measured
if
all
this
is
done
the
preparation
necessary
in
the
morning
will
consist
merely
of
slicing
the
bananas
reheating
the
cream
of
wheat
preparing
the
coffee
baking
the
muffins
and
making
the
omelet
while
the
coffee
and
cream
of
wheat
are
heating
or
cooking
the
oven
will
be
heating
so
that
when
the

are
mixed
it
will
be
ready
to
bake
them
and
while
these
are
baking
the
omelet
may
be

importance
of

as

variety
in
vegetables
as
understood
in
cookery
vegetables
refer
to
plants
or
parts
of
plants
that
are
used
as
food
vegetables
may
consist
of
the
entire
plant
as
for
example
the
beet
the
stem
as
asparagus
and
celery
the
root
as
carrot
and
turnip
the
underground
stem
or
tuber
as
the
white
potato
and
onion
the
foliage
as
cabbage
and
spinach
the
flower
of
the
plant
as
cauliflower
the
pods
which
hold
the
seeds
of
the
plant
or
the
seeds
themselves
as
peas
and
beans
or
that
which
in
reality
is
fruit
although
for
table
use
always
considered
a
vegetable
as
the
tomato
and
eggplant
because
of
this
large
assortment
vegetables
afford
the
greatest
possible
variety
in
flavor
appearance
texture
quality
and
food
value
they
therefore
assume
a
place
of
very
great
importance
in
the
diet
of
individuals
and
in
the
plans
of
the
housewife
who
has
all
the
meals
to
prepare
for
her
family
in
fact
there
is
scarcely
a
meal
except
breakfast
at
which
vegetables
are
not
served
for
dinner
they
form
a
part
or
all
of
each
course
in
the
meal
except
perhaps
the
dessert
and
occasionally
they
may
be
used
for
this
although
two
or
more
vegetables
are
nearly
always
served
in
even
a
simple
meal
the
use
of
vegetables
in
most
households
is
limited
to
those
few
varieties
which
are
especially
preferred
by
the
family
as
a
rule
there
are
a
number
of
other
vegetables
that
would
be
very
acceptable
if
prepared
in
certain
appetizing
ways
an
effort
should
therefore
be
made
to
include
all
such
vegetables
in
the
dietary
for
they
may
be
used
to
decided
advantage
and
at
the
same
time
they
afford
variety
in
the
meals
the
constant
demand
for
variety
in
this
food
makes
acceptable
new
recipes
for
the
preparation
of
the
vegetables
already
known
and
information
for
the
use
of
the
unfamiliar
kinds
great
variety
also
exists
in
the
flavor
of
vegetables
which
they
derive
from
their
volatile
oils
that
is
the
oils
that
evaporate
rapidly
on
exposure
to
the
air
in
some
cases
the
flavor
is
disagreeably
strong
and
must
be
dissipated
or
driven
away
in
order
to
make
the
vegetables
agreeable
to
the
taste
and
to
prevent
them
from
disagreeing
with
those
who
eat
them
in
others
the
flavor
is
very
mild
so
that
unless
the
vegetables
are
properly
prepared
the
flavor
may
be
almost
lost
when
the
principles
relating
to
the
cooking
of
vegetables
are
thoroughly
understood
little
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
preparing
them
so
that
the
flavor
is
dissipated
or
retained
as
the
case
may
require
the
food
value
of
vegetables
varies
as
much
as
do
their
form
and
flavor
some
of
them
having
almost
no
food
value
others
having
a
great
deal
and
the
remainder
varying
between
these
two
extremes
the
housewife
who
wishes
to
provide
economically
for
her
family
and
at
the
same
time
give
them
food
that
is
best
suited
to
their
needs
should
learn
as
much
of
the
composition
and
food
value
of
the
various
kinds
of
vegetables
as
possible
if
besides
acquiring
this
knowledge
she
learns
a
variety
of
ways
in
which
to
prepare
each
kind
she
will
find
that
it
is
possible
to
substitute
vegetable
dishes
for
the
more
expensive
foods
for
instance
it
is
often
possible
to
substitute
a
vegetable
dish
for
a
meat
dish
several
times
a
week
but
the
composition
of
the
vegetable
dish
must
be
such
that
it
will
really
take
the
place
of
the
meat
dish
that
it
is
possible
for
adults
to
live
on
vegetables
alone
has
been
proved
by
vegetarians
that
is
persons
who
exclude
meat
from
the
diet
they
have
shown
that
all
the
elements
necessary
to
build
and
maintain
the
human
body
are
contained
in
vegetables
fruits
and
cereals
and
also
that
these
elements
are
in
such
quantity
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
supply
them
in
any
other
way
even
if
it
is
not
desired
to
use
such
foods
exclusively
as
much
use
should
be
made
of
them
as
possible
for
they
average
a
lower
cost
than
the
foods
such
as
eggs
meat
and
milk
the
use
of
vegetables
however
need
not
be
restricted
to
adults
for
when
properly
prepared
they
may
be
included
to
advantage
in
the
diet
of
very
young
children
in
fact
children
should
be
trained
to
eat
vegetables
of
all
kinds
for
such
training
not
only
will
enable
each
one
to
grow
up
with
a
correct
appreciation
for
all
edible
things
but
will
make
the
preparation
of
meals
easier
for
the
housewife
vegetables
should
receive
great
care
in
their
preparation
whether
the
method
involved
is
simple
or
complicated
any
of
the
methods
of
cookery
that
call
for
the
application
of
heat
may
be
applied
to
them
and
in
many
cases
they
are
served
without
cooking
merely
dressing
or
seasoning
being
added
good
vegetables
may
be
ruined
by
improper
preparation
while
those
which
are
in
excellent
condition
may
be
improved
by
the
application
of
the
correct
methods
in
their
preparation
vegetables
that
are
inexpensive
but
highly
nutritious
should
be
used
when
it
is
necessary
to
practice
economy
because
when
they
are
properly
prepared
they
form
a
valuable
addition
to
a
meal
all
varieties
of
vegetables
are
grown
almost
universally
this
fact
together
with
the
facts
that
they
mature
at
different
times
during
the
season
according
to
the
climate
in
which
they
are
grown
and
that
most
varieties
can
be
conveniently
shipped
makes
the
season
in
which
certain
fresh
vegetables
can
be
obtained
much
longer
than
it
formerly
was
for
instance
very
early
in
the
season
long
before
it
is
possible
to
have
beans
peas
and
other
vegetables
in
the
north
they
are
shipped
from
the
extreme
south
and
as
the
season
advances
they
mature
farther
and
farther
north
therefore
they
may
be
constantly
supplied
to
the
northern
markets
until
the
time
when
they
mature
in
that
locality
in
order
not
to
waste
vegetables
and
to
have
them
in
the
best
possible
condition
when
they
are
desired
for
preparation
every
housewife
should
realize
that
the
selection
and
care
of
vegetables
are
also
important
matters
to
consider
the
selection
must
be
learned
by
familiarity
with
them
as
well
as
practice
in
buying
and
the
housewife
must
be
guided
by
the
suitability
of
the
vegetables
and
the
money
she
has
to
spend
for
them
the
care
that
must
be
given
to
them
is
determined
by
the
kinds
that
are
purchased
some
requiring
one
kind
of
care
in
storage
and
others
entirely
different
attention
structure
composition
and
food
value
structure
of
although
vegetables
vary
greatly
in
composition
and
consequently
in
food
value
they
are
similar
so
far
as
physical
structure
is
concerned
in
general
they
consist
of
a
skeleton
framework
that
is
made
up
of
cellulose
their
digestible
part
is
composed
of
tiny
cells
having
thin
walls
that
confine
the
actual
food
material
in
the
form
of
a
liquid
or
semiliquid
as
the
vegetables
grow
old
the
cellulose
material
and
the
cell
walls
gradually
toughen
with
the
result
that
old
vegetables
are
less
easily
made
tender
than
young
ones
and
are
not
so
agreeable
to
the
taste
as
those
which
have
not
grown
hard
the
total
food
value
of
vegetables
as
well
as
of
cereals
meats
and
in
fact
all
foods
varies
with
the
quantity
of
water
and
cellulose
they
contain
therefore
the
vegetables
that
contain
the
least
coarse
material
are
the
ones
that
have
the
highest
food
value
the
green
color
that
characterizes
many
vegetables
is
due
to
a
substance
called
this
substance
is
essential
to
the
normal
growth
of
plants
and
is
present
in
the
correct
amount
in
only
those
which
are
properly
exposed
to
the
sunlight
sufficient
proof
of
this
is
seen
in
the
case
of
vegetables
that
form
heads
as
for
instance
cabbage
and
head
lettuce
as
is
well
known
the
outside
leaves
are
green
while
the
inside
ones
are
practically
white
since
it
is
exposure
to
the
light
that
produces
the
green
color
a
vegetable
or
plant
of
any
kind
can
be
bleached
by
merely
covering
it
in
order
to
keep
out
the
sunlight
this
procedure
also
enables
the
plants
to
remain
more
tender
than
those
which
have
been
allowed
to
grow
in
the
normal
way
and
become
green
for
instance
the
inside
leaves
of
a
head
of
lettuce
are
always
very
much
more
tender
than
the
green
outside
leaves
in
fact
the
center
of
any
kind
of
plant
that
is
the
leaves
and
the
stem
that
appear
last
are
more
tender
possess
a
lighter
color
and
have
a
more
delicate
flavor
than
the
older
ones
protein
in
taken
as
a
whole
vegetables
are
not
high
in
protein
some
of
them
contain
practically
none
of
this
food
substance
and
others
contain
a
comparatively
large
amount
but
the
average
is
rather
low
vegetables
that
are
high
in
water
such
as
lettuce
celery
tomatoes
and
cucumbers
contain
so
little
protein
that
the
quantity
is
not
appreciable
such
vegetables
as
potatoes
beets
carrots
etc
contain
slightly
larger
quantities
dried
vegetables
such
as
beans
peas
and
lentils
contain
comparatively
large
amounts
of
this
substance
and
for
this
reason
may
be
substituted
for
such
foods
as
meat
and
fish
the
composition
of
vegetable
protein
is
only
slightly
different
from
that
of
animal
protein
in
fact
the
experiments
of
scientists
show
that
animal
protein
may
be
readily
replaced
by
vegetable
protein
one
of
these
proteins
is
sometimes
called
but
the
chief
protein
of
vegetables
containing
the
largest
amount
of
this
substance
namely
beans
peas
and
lentils
is
called
from
the
term
the
name
of
this
class
of
vegetables
it
is
generally
agreed
that
vegetable
protein
is
not
so
digestible
as
animal
protein
but
this
disadvantage
is
offset
by
the
fact
that
it
does
not
bring
about
so
much
intestinal
trouble
as
does
the
protein
of
animal
foods
and
is
less
likely
to
cause
disturbances
that
are
usually
attributed
to
foods
high
in
this
substance
vegetable
protein
is
affected
by
heat
in
much
the
same
way
as
other
protein
when
any
of
the
dry
vegetables
high
in
protein
are
served
at
a
meal
meat
should
be
eliminated
or
the
result
will
be
an
oversupply
of
protein
as
this
condition
is
not
only
harmful
but
wasteful
it
is
one
that
should
receive
proper
consideration
from
the
housewife
fat
in
as
vegetables
as
a
class
are
low
in
protein
so
are
they
low
in
fat
in
the
case
of
some
vegetables
the
quantity
of
fat
they
contain
is
so
small
that
it
is
never
considered
in
discussing
the
food
value
of
these
vegetables
while
in
others
slightly
larger
quantities
are
to
be
found
however
on
the
whole
vegetables
are
so
nearly
lacking
in
this
food
substance
that
it
is
necessary
to
supply
fat
in
their
preparation
and
in
the
serving
of
meals
in
which
they
are
included
this
is
done
in
a
variety
of
ways
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
vegetable
for
instance
in
order
that
baked
beans
may
take
the
place
of
meat
entirely
fat
in
the
form
of
salt
pork
is
usually
added
when
they
are
prepared
the
pork
of
course
also
supplies
a
very
small
amount
of
protein
but
it
is
not
used
with
the
beans
for
this
purpose
practically
all
cooked
vegetables
are
served
with
butter
or
with
a
sauce
that
contains
fat
green
vegetables
that
require
no
cooking
but
are
served
as
a
salad
are
supplied
with
fat
by
the
salad
dressing
that
is
used
with
them
the
fat
varies
greatly
depending
on
the
kind
of
dressing
used
carbohydrates
in
when
the
composition
of
vegetables
is
considered
chemically
the
most
striking
thing
about
them
is
the
carbohydrates
they
contain
it
is
this
that
distinguishes
this
class
of
foods
from
animal
foods
the
carbohydrate
of
vegetables
is
found
in
both
its
forms
starch
and
sugar
it
is
in
the
form
of
sugar
in
many
of
the
vegetables
when
they
are
young
or
immature
but
it
turns
into
starch
as
they
mature
this
change
can
be
easily
observed
in
the
case
of
peas
as
is
well
known
young
green
peas
are
rather
sweet
because
of
the
sugar
they
contain
while
mature
or
dried
peas
have
lost
their
sweetness
and
are
starchy
the
sugar
that
is
found
in
large
quantities
in
such
vegetables
as
peas
carrots
turnips
etc
is
largely
cane
sugar
the
starch
that
vegetables
contain
occurs
in
tiny
granules
just
as
it
is
found
in
cereals
and
is
affected
by
cooking
in
the
same
way
the
mature
vegetables
in
which
the
starch
has
developed
although
less
tender
and
less
sweet
than
young
ones
have
a
higher
food
value
in
fact
the
carbohydrate
that
vegetables
contain
constitutes
a
large
proportion
of
their
food
value
one
of
the
chief
sources
of
starch
among
vegetables
is
the
potato
in
which
the
starch
grains
are
large
and
if
properly
cooked
easily
digested
irish
or
white
potatoes
contain
very
little
carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
sugar
but
in
the
sweet
potato
much
of
the
carbohydrate
is
sugar
in
either
of
these
two
forms
starch
and
sugar
vegetable
carbohydrate
is
easily
digested
mineral
matter
or
ash
in
the
mineral
matter
in
vegetables
is
found
in
comparatively
large
quantities
the
average
amount
being
slightly
over
per
cent
the
presence
of
this
substance
is
of
great
value
because
the
mineral
salts
of
both
fruits
and
vegetables
are
essential
in
the
diet
of
adults
in
order
to
keep
their
health
in
a
normal
condition
the
mineral
salts
of
vegetables
render
the
blood
more
alkaline
instead
of
more
acid
as
do
those
contained
in
cereals
and
meat
a
large
number
of
vegetables
particularly
those
low
in
food
value
such
as
greens
celery
are
very
valuable
for
their
mineral
salts
in
reality
this
substance
and
the
cellulose
they
contain
are
the
things
that
recommend
the
use
of
these
vegetables
in
the
diet
minerals
of
all
kinds
are
found
in
solution
in
the
water
contained
in
vegetables
but
chief
among
them
are
calcium
sodium
iron
phosphorus
and
sulphur
greens
and
salad
vegetables
are
particularly
high
in
iron
the
element
that
assists
in
keeping
the
blood
in
good
condition
these
minerals
are
easily
lost
if
the
method
of
cookery
is
not
planned
to
retain
them
cellulose
in
the
special
use
of
cellulose
as
has
already
been
learned
is
to
serve
as
bulk
in
the
food
containing
it
in
vegetables
the
cellulose
varies
greatly
as
to
quantity
as
well
as
to
texture
and
the
amount
that
can
be
digested
in
young
vegetables
it
is
very
soft
and
perhaps
digestible
to
a
certain
extent
but
as
they
grow
older
it
hardens
and
they
become
tough
this
fact
is
clearly
demonstrated
in
the
case
of
beets
those
which
are
pulled
from
the
garden
in
the
summer
and
cooked
are
tender
and
soft
but
those
which
are
allowed
to
mature
in
the
ground
and
are
then
put
away
for
winter
are
when
cooked
in
the
late
winter
or
early
spring
so
hard
and
tough
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
make
them
soft
the
quantity
of
cellulose
that
vegetables
contain
therefore
depends
largely
on
their
age
and
condition
those
low
in
total
food
value
contain
as
a
rule
larger
quantities
of
it
than
those
high
in
food
value
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
both
water
and
cellulose
which
are
usually
found
together
in
large
quantities
help
to
detract
from
the
fuel
or
food
value
of
foods
very
young
persons
or
those
who
are
ill
sometimes
find
it
impossible
to
take
in
its
original
form
a
vegetable
that
contains
a
large
amount
of
bulk
or
cellulose
in
such
a
case
the
vegetable
may
be
put
through
a
colander
or
a
sieve
in
order
to
break
up
the
cellulose
and
make
it
easier
to
digest
under
ordinary
conditions
cellulose
should
not
be
avoided
but
should
be
included
in
large
quantities
in
the
diet
through
the
vegetables
that
are
consumed
daily
water
in
the
majority
of
vegetables
contain
a
large
quantity
of
water
such
vegetables
as
lettuce
cucumbers
tomatoes
which
are
low
in
total
food
value
contain
the
most
water
the
average
percentage
being
about
the
dry
vegetables
which
are
high
in
food
value
average
only
about
per
cent
of
water
the
water
that
is
found
in
vegetables
whether
it
is
much
or
little
is
contained
in
structures
surrounded
by
cellulose
and
it
holds
in
solution
the
mineral
salts
and
much
of
the
nutriment
of
the
vegetables
in
addition
the
water
holds
in
solution
to
a
certain
extent
the
material
that
gives
vegetables
their
distinctive
flavor
when
any
of
this
water
is
lost
in
the
preparation
of
vegetables
the
substances
that
it
contains
are
also
lost
it
is
therefore
essential
that
correct
methods
of
preparation
be
chosen
for
the
cooking
of
this
food
so
as
to
prevent
the
waste
of
valuable
food
materials
digestibility
of
the
digestibility
of
vegetables
is
largely
an
individual
matter
that
is
a
vegetable
that
agrees
with
one
person
may
not
agree
with
another
the
fact
that
there
appears
to
be
no
apparent
reason
for
such
a
condition
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
due
to
the
peculiarities
of
the
person
because
of
this
it
is
not
fair
to
make
the
general
statement
that
a
particular
vegetable
is
easy
to
digest
and
another
one
is
hard
to
digest
the
chief
cause
for
difficulty
in
the
digestion
of
vegetables
lies
in
their
volatile
oils
which
give
them
their
flavor
but
which
are
irritating
to
many
persons
vegetables
having
a
strong
flavor
such
as
radishes
onions
cucumbers
cabbage
and
cauliflower
are
the
ones
that
disagree
most
frequently
with
persons
who
eat
them
but
sometimes
the
way
in
which
some
of
them
are
cooked
has
more
to
do
with
this
than
the
vegetables
themselves
vegetables
containing
considerable
cellulose
and
water
do
not
of
themselves
give
trouble
in
digestion
because
they
contain
practically
nothing
to
digest
but
they
are
sometimes
responsible
for
interfering
with
the
digestion
of
other
foods
vegetables
that
are
extremely
high
in
starch
such
as
potatoes
are
easily
digested
by
most
persons
provided
they
are
properly
cooked
for
instance
a
plain
baked
potato
is
easily
digested
but
the
same
potato
sautéd
in
fat
is
more
difficult
of
digestion

vegetables
vary
considerably
in
the

of

do
they
differ
greatly
in
their

this
is

closely
constant

as
well
as
the
variation

be
not
only
interesting
but
instructive

while

purchase
and
care
of
vegetables
purchase
of
vegetables
as
in
the
case
of
other
foods
the
purchase
of
vegetables
in
the
market
requires
special
knowledge
and
attention
in
order
that
the
best
value
may
be
obtained
for
the
money
expended
the
housewife
who
has
a
limited
amount
of
money
to
spend
for
food
does
not
buy
wisely
when
she
purchases
vegetables
out
of
season
or
those
which
must
be
shipped
long
distances
on
the
other
hand
it
will
be
found
that
vegetables
bought
in
season
as
well
as
those
which
are
plentiful
in
the
particular
locality
in
which
they
are
sold
especially
if
they
are
perishable
vegetables
are
lowest
in
price
and
are
in
the
best
condition
for
food
therefore
whether
the
income
is
limited
or
not
it
is
wisdom
on
the
part
of
the
housewife
to
buy
vegetables
that
grow
in
the
neighboring
region
and
to
purchase
them
when
they
are
in
season
a
very
important
point
for
the
housewife
to
keep
in
mind
regarding
the
purchase
of
vegetables
is
that
their
price
is
determined
not
by
their
value
as
food
but
by
their
scarcity
and
the
demand
for
them
take
for
example
the
case
of
mushrooms
as
shown
in
table
i
this
vegetable
is
low
in
food
value
containing
only
calories
to
the
pound
but
if
purchased
they
are
always
an
expensive
food
the
high
price
asked
for
mushrooms
is
entirely
dependent
on
their
scarcity
if
there
is
much
demand
in
a
certain
community
for
a
food
that
is
not
plentiful
in
the
market
the
price
of
that
food
always
goes
up
as
in
the
case
of
mushrooms
many
expensive
foods
add
practically
nothing
in
the
way
of
nourishment
their
only
value
being
in
the
variety
of
flavor
they
supply
furthermore
in
order
to
provide
wisely
the
person
who
purchases
vegetables
for
the
family
should
be
able
to
judge
whether
she
is
getting
full
value
in
food
for
the
money
she
invests
she
can
not
always
do
this
with
each
particular
vegetable
purchased
but
she
can
buy
in
such
a
way
that
what
she
purchases
will
average
correctly
in
this
respect
the
perishable
vegetables
should
be
bought
as
fresh
as
possible
no
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
determining
this
for
they
will
soon
wither
or
rot
if
they
are
not
fresh
but
the
point
is
to
find
out
their
condition
before
they
are
bought
the
housewife
should
be
ever
on
the
alert
and
should
examine
carefully
the
vegetables
she
buys
before
they
are
accepted
from
the
grocer
or
taken
from
the
market
in
the
case
of
certain
vegetables
it
is
possible
to
conceal
the
fact
that
they
are
stale
for
instance
the
outside
leaves
of
a
head
of
lettuce
or
endive
are
sometimes
removed
and
only
the
bleached
center
is
offered
for
sale
but
this
always
indicates
that
the
outside
leaves
were
either
withered
or
spoiled
or
they
would
not
have
been
taken
off
much
of
the
spoiling
of
vegetables
can
be
avoided
if
proper
attention
is
given
to
them
in
the
market
food
of
this
kind
should
be
so
displayed
that
it
is
not
exposed
to
the
dirt
and
dust
of
the
street
nor
to
flies
and
other
destructive
vermin
the
practice
of
displaying
vegetables
on
a
stand
in
front
of
a
store
is
gradually
losing
favor
with
the
housewife
who
understands
the
sanitary
precautions
that
should
be
taken
with
foods
on
the
other
hand
housewives
owe
it
to
the
merchant
not
to
handle
the
foods
they
are
going
to
buy
for
the
handling
of
them
not
only
injures
them
so
that
they
will
not
keep
well
but
renders
them
unfit
to
be
accepted
by
the
next
purchaser
the
manner
in
which
vegetables
are
sold
should
also
receive
consideration
it
has
been
the
custom
to
sell
them
by
measure
but
both
housewives
and
merchants
have
come
to
realize
that
it
is
fairer
to
sell
them
by
weight
experience
has
shown
that
a
pound
is
much
more
likely
to
be
always
uniform
than
is
a
quart
or
a
peck
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
no
two
dealers
are
likely
to
measure
in
exactly
the
same
way
even
though
the
measures
they
use
are
up
to
the
standard
in
size
then
too
especially
in
the
case
of
vegetables
that
are
of
various
sizes
and
shapes
it
is
impossible
to
fill
a
measure
properly
because
of
the
shape
of
the
vegetables
and
so
either
the
housewife
often
receives
short
measure
or
the
merchant
gives
more
than
the
measure
requires
all
difficulty
of
this
kind
is
entirely
overcome
when
vegetables
are
weighed
care
of
vegetables
perishable
vegetables
that
is
those
which
spoil
quickly
are
usually
bought
in
small
quantities
and
so
are
used
up
quickly
however
if
they
are
kept
on
hand
for
only
a
day
or
so
they
require
a
definite
amount
of
care
in
order
to
insure
the
most
satisfactory
results
in
their
use
to
prevent
them
from
spoiling
or
withering
they
should
be
kept
in
a
cool
damp
place
until
they
are
needed
the
most
effective
and
convenient
way
in
which
to
accomplish
this
is
to
store
them
in
a
refrigerator
or
other
similar
device
if
ice
can
not
be
obtained
the
cellar
should
be
utilized
before
vegetables
of
this
kind
are
put
away
after
being
delivered
from
the
market
they
should
be
looked
over
carefully
and
any
that
are
spoiled
should
be
discarded
in
order
to
prevent
others
that
they
might
touch
from
becoming
tainted
as
little
handling
as
possible
however
is
advantageous
because
when
such
foods
become
bruised
and
are
then
allowed
to
stand
they
are
likely
to
spoil
very
quickly
the
less
perishable
vegetables
commonly
called
winter
vegetables
because
they
may
be
kept
through
the
winter
may
be
bought
in
quantity
provided
proper
storage
facilities
to
prevent
them
from
spoiling
are
available
potatoes
in
particular
are
usually
purchased
in
this
way
for
as
a
rule
they
may
be
obtained
at
a
better
price
than
when
bought
in
small
quantities
and
then
too
they
are
a
vegetable
that
most
families
use
nearly
every
day
if
they
are
bought
in
quantity
they
should
first
be
thoroughly
tested
for
often
a
potato
looks
very
well
on
the
outside
while
its
texture
and
flavor
may
not
be
at
all
in
accordance
with
its
appearance
great
care
should
also
be
exercised
to
see
that
this
vegetable
as
well
as
carrots
turnips
parsnips
has
not
been
frosted
for
frost
ruins
them
as
to
texture
and
keeping
qualities
all
such
vegetables
as
these
provided
they
must
be
stored
for
any
length
of
time
keep
best
in
a
cold
fairly
dry
atmosphere
to
prevent
them
from
sprouting
the
storage
room
should
if
possible
be
kept
dark
but
in
case
they
do
sprout
the
sprouts
should
be
removed
as
soon
as
they
are
discovered
the
best
receptacles
for
the
storage
of
these
winter
vegetables
are
bins
a
convenient
type
of
which
is
shown
in
of
part
and
the
most
satisfactory
place
in
which
to
put
such
bins
is
a
cellar
that
has
a
dirt
floor
rather
than
a
board
or
a
cement
floor
classification
of
vegetables
because
of
their
difference
in
physical
structure
both
as
plants
or
parts
of
plants
and
their
variation
in
chemical
composition
it
is
a
rather
difficult
matter
to
classify
vegetables
the
vegetables
that
are
discussed
throughout
these
sections
are
therefore
not
included
in
any
classes
but
are
arranged
alphabetically
a
plan
that
the
housewife
will
find
very
convenient
however
there
are
a
few
general
classes
whose
names
and
characteristics
should
be
known
by
the
housewife
for
an
understanding
of
them
will
enable
her
to
make
a
more
intelligent
use
of
this
food
these
classes
together
with
a
brief
description
of
the
features
that
characterize
them
and
the
names
by
which
the
principal
varieties
are
known
are
here
given
illustration
fig
succulent
vegetables
are
those
which
are
generally
eaten
for
their
appetizing
effect
and
their
value
as
a
source
of
mineral
salts
and
bulk
these
vegetables
which
get
their
name
from
the
fact
that
they
are
juicy
in
texture
include
the
greens
such
as
spinach
swiss
chard
dandelion
lettuce
also
celery
asparagus
cabbage
and
all
other
plants
whose
green
leaves
and
stems
are
edible
succulent
vegetables
may
be
cooked
but
they
are
often
used
as
cold
relishes
or
in
the
making
of
salads
root
tuber
and
bulb
vegetables
form
another
class
examples
of
several
roots
are
shown
in
fig
which
from
left
to
right
are
salsify
carrots
turnips
and
parsnips
the
varieties
included
in
this
class
are
closely
related
as
to
food
value
and
on
the
whole
average
much
higher
in
this
characteristic
than
do
the
succulent
vegetables
irish
potatoes
and
jerusalem
artichokes
are
examples
of
tubers
sweet
potatoes
beets
radishes
in
addition
to
the
vegetables
shown
in
fig
belong
to
the
roots
and
onions
and
all
the
vegetables
related
to
the
onion
such
as
garlic
shallots
and
leeks
are
illustrations
of
bulbs
or
enlarged
underground
stems
fruit
and
flower
vegetables
form
a
third
class
they
present
great
variety
in
appearance
structure
and
composition
to
this
class
belong
cucumbers
eggplant
winter
and
summer
squash
vegetable
marrow
tomatoes
peppers
and
okra
which
are
in
reality
fruits
but
are
used
as
vegetables
flower
vegetables
include
california
or
french
artichokes
and
cauliflower
all
of
which
are
in
reality
the
buds
of
flowers
or
plants
and
are
eaten
for
food
legumes
form
a
fourth
class
of
vegetables
and
they
include
all
the
varieties
of
beans
peas
and
lentils
when
these
foods
are
mature
and
dried
they
have
the
highest
food
value
of
all
the
vegetables
among
the
beans
are
lima
beans
kidney
beans
navy
or
soup
beans
soy
beans
and
many
others
the
peas
include
the
various
garden
varieties
that
have
been
allowed
to
mature
and
many
others
some
of
which
are
not
suitable
for
human
consumption
the
lentils
occur
in
numerous
varieties
too
but
those
commonly
used
are
the
red
yellow
and
black
ones
to
legumes
also
belong
peanuts
but
as
they
are
seldom
used
as
vegetables
in
cookery
no
further
mention
is
made
of
them
in
this
section
varieties
of
vegetables
and
their
preparation
general
methods
of
preparation
and
cooking
preparing
vegetables
for
before
many
vegetables
can
be
cooked
they
require
a
certain
amount
of
preparation
such
as
washing
soaking
peeling
cutting
up
into
suitable
sizes
etc
when
they
must
be
peeled
great
care
should
be
taken
not
to
remove
too
much
of
the
vegetable
with
the
skin
whenever
it
is
possible
to
do
so
vegetables
should
be
cooked
in
their
skins
as
there
is
much
less
waste
of
edible
material
if
the
skins
are
removed
after
cooking
potatoes
that
are
to
be
fried
hashed
brown
or
used
for
salad
and
other
similar
dishes
may
be
boiled
in
their
skins
and
peeled
afterwards
just
as
conveniently
as
to
be
peeled
first
and
then
boiled
indeed
this
plan
is
strongly
recommended
for
it
not
only
saves
material
that
is
removed
in
the
peeling
but
also
conserves
the
mineral
salts
and
the
soluble
food
material
much
of
which
is
lost
in
the
water
during
the
cooking
if
it
is
desired
to
remove
the
peeling
before
cooking
it
will
be
found
more
economical
to
put
the
vegetables
in
water
and
then
scrape
off
the
skins
than
to
cut
them
off
with
a
knife
this
method
is
especially
satisfactory
with
new
potatoes
and
with
such
vegetables
as
carrots
parsnips
salsify
and
turnips
the
scraping
can
be
accomplished
more
easily
if
the
vegetables
are
first
plunged
into
boiling
water
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
dipped
into
cold
water
when
entire
heads
of
such
vegetables
as
cabbage
cauliflower
brussels
sprouts
etc
are
to
be
cooked
they
should
be
soaked
head
down
for
at
least
hour
in
salted
water
made
by
adding
of
salt
to
quart
of
water
this
is
done
in
order
to
remove
any
bugs
or
worms
that
may
be
lodged
in
the
head
the
correct
proportion
of
salt
is
an
important
detail
of
this
process
for
if
salt
water
that
is
too
strong
is
used
it
will
kill
the
bugs
or
worms
and
they
will
remain
in
the
head
methods
of
cooking
applied
to
the
usual
methods
of
cooking
applied
to
vegetables
are
boiling
steaming
baking
stewing
frying
sautéing
broiling
and
roasting
which
one
of
these
to
select
depends
of
course
on
the
particular
kind
of
vegetable
that
is
to
be
cooked
and
the
result
that
is
desired
but
if
possible
an
effort
should
be
made
to
select
an
economical
method
starchy
vegetables
such
as
irish
and
sweet
potatoes
beans
develop
a
more
delicious
flavor
when
they
are
baked
than
when
they
are
cooked
by
any
other
method
of
preparation
steaming
is
an
excellent
means
of
preparing
vegetables
that
must
be
cooked
by
moist
heat
especially
when
it
is
desired
that
no
soluble
material
be
lost
as
is
often
the
case
in
boiling
frying
and
sautéing
when
applied
to
vegetables
usually
produce
a
delicious
flavor
but
often
render
the
vegetables
decidedly
indigestible
for
this
reason
vegetables
so
prepared
should
seldom
if
ever
be
served
to
children
and
to
persons
whose
digestion
is
not
good
effect
of
cooking
on
the
various
ways
in
which
cooking
affects
vegetables
should
be
thoroughly
understood
by
the
housewife
in
the
first
place
some
methods
conserve
the
food
material
whereas
others
waste
it
for
instance
boiling
in
water
which
is
probably
one
of
the
most
common
ways
of
cooking
vegetables
is
decidedly
advantageous
in
some
respects
but
the
water
dissolves
much
of
the
soluble
material
such
as
mineral
salts
sugar
found
in
the
vegetables
so
that
unless
some
use
is
made
of
this
water
in
the
cooking
of
other
foods
considerable
waste
results
on
the
other
hand
steaming
and
baking
permit
no
loss
of
food
material
and
so
they
should
be
applied
to
vegetables
whenever
it
is
desired
to
conserve
food
substances
the
flavors
of
vegetables
are
greatly
changed
during
the
process
of
cooking
being
increased
in
some
cases
and
decreased
in
others
in
the
case
of
such
strongly
flavored
vegetables
as
cabbage
cauliflower
onions
it
is
advisable
to
dissipate
part
of
the
flavor
therefore
such
vegetables
should
be
cooked
in
an
open
vessel
in
order
that
the
flavor
may
be
decreased
by
evaporation
vegetables
mild
in
flavor
however
are
improved
by
being
cooked
in
a
closed
vessel
for
all
their
flavor
should
be
retained
the
overcooking
of
vegetables
is
sometimes
responsible
for
an
increase
of
a
disagreeable
flavor
another
feature
of
vegetables
often
changed
by
cooking
is
their
color
for
instance
green
vegetables
do
not
upon
cooking
always
remain
green
in
many
cases
the
color
may
be
improved
by
adding
a
very
small
quantity
of
soda
to
the
water
in
which
the
vegetables
are
cooked
attention
should
also
be
given
to
the
length
of
time
vegetables
are
subjected
to
heat
for
the
overboiling
of
some
vegetables
is
liable
to
develop
an
unattractive
color
in
them
this
is
particularly
the
case
with
cabbage
cauliflower
and
brussels
sprouts
which
develop
not
only
a
strong
disagreeable
flavor
but
also
a
reddish
color
when
cooked
too
long
the
application
of
heat
to
vegetables
also
has
a
definite
effect
on
them
by
sufficient
cooking
the
cellulose
of
vegetables
is
softened
to
the
extent
that
it
is
less
irritating
and
much
more
likely
to
be
partly
digested
than
that
of
raw
vegetables
the
acids
of
fruits
increase
upon
cooking
and
so
the
acidity
of
vegetables
is
increased
to
a
certain
extent
vegetables
that
contain
starch
are
rendered
digestible
in
no
other
way
than
by
cooking
on
the
other
hand
the
protein
material
of
this
food
is
coagulated
by
the
application
of
heat
just
as
the
white
of
an
egg
or
the
tissue
of
meat
is
coagulated
and
hardened
however
cooking
is
the
only
means
of
softening
the
cellulose
that
surrounds
this
material
still
foods
such
as
beans
peas
and
lentils
can
be
much
improved
if
they
are
cooked
in
water
that
is
not
very
hard
the
lime
in
hard
water
has
a
tendency
to
harden
them
to
the
extent
that
they
require
a
much
longer
time
to
cook
than
when
soft
water
is
used
these
vegetables
may
be
still
further
softened
by
the
addition
of
a
small
quantity
of
soda
to
the
water
in
which
they
are
cooked
but
care
should
be
taken
not
to
use
too
much
soda
as
it
will
injure
the
flavor
when
soda
is
used
the
vegetable
should
be
parboiled
for
or
minutes
in
the
soda
water
and
then
drained
and
cooked
in
fresh
water
this
method
of
course
does
not
apply
to
vegetables
that
are
cooked
in
soda
water
to
retain
their
color
salt
is
always
added
in
the
cooking
of
vegetables
to
season
them
in
the
use
of
salt
two
important
points
must
be
borne
in
mind
first
that
it
has
the
effect
of
hardening
the
tissues
of
the
vegetable
in
much
the
same
manner
as
it
hardens
the
tissues
of
meat
and
secondly
that
it
helps
to
draw
out
the
flavor
of
the
vegetables
these
two
facts
determine
largely
the
time
for
adding
the
salt
if
an
old
tough
winter
vegetable
is
to
be
prepared
it
should
be
cooked
until
nearly
soft
in
water
that
contains
no
salt
and
the
salt
should
be
added
just
before
the
cooking
is
finished
when
it
is
desired
to
draw
out
the
flavor
as
for
instance
when
vegetables
are
cooked
for
soup
or
stews
the
salt
should
be
supplied
when
the
vegetables
are
put
on
to
cook
young
tender
vegetables
may
be
cooked
in
salt
water
but
as
such
water
extracts
a
certain
amount
of
flavor
an
effort
should
be
made
to
use
it
in
the
preparation
of
stews
sauces
and
soups
sauces
for
vegetables
vegetables
may
of
course
be
served
plain
but
they
are
greatly
improved
in
flavor
nutritive
value
and
often
in
appearance
by
the
addition
of
a
sauce
numerous
sauces
are
used
for
this
purpose
the
one
to
select
depending
somewhat
on
the
vegetable
the
method
of
cooking
employed
and
the
flavor
that
is
desired
recipes
for
the
sauces
found
to
be
most
satisfactory
are
here
given
it
will
be
well
to
practice
the
making
of
these
so
as
to
become
familiar
with
them
and
thus
know
just
what
sauce
is
meant
when
reference
is
made
to
a
particular
sauce
in
the
recipes
for
vegetables
the
quantities
given
in
the
recipes
for
sauces
will
make
sufficient
sauce
to
dress
the
vegetables
required
for
four
to
six
persons
white
sauce
which
is
probably
the
one
that
is
used
oftenest
may
be
made
in
various
thicknesses
as
has
been
explained
previously
however
the
medium
white
sauce
has
been
found
to
be
the
one
most
nearly
correct
for
vegetables
and
consequently

asparagus
and
its
preparation
asparagus
is
a
vegetable
that
consists
of
the
shoots
of
the
plant
which
are
eaten
before
the
blossoms
develop
it
grows
quickly
and
is
very
tender
if
the
shoots
are
clipped
at
just
the
right
time
after
they
appear
above
the
ground
it
comes
early
in
the
spring
being
about
the
first
green
vegetable
that
gets
into
the
local
market
but
its
season
is
comparatively
short
it
does
not
keep
long
after
it
is
purchased
and
is
better
when
it
is
used
at
once
if
asparagus
must
be
kept
for
any
length
of
time
it
should
be
stored
in
a
cool
damp
place
in
selecting
asparagus
it
should
be
remembered
that
there
are
two
varieties
one
of
which
is
green
and
the
other
white
the
stems
of
the
green
asparagus
should
be
green
to
the
bottom
and
should
not
be
hard
nor
woody
where
they
are
cut
from
the
plant
however
if
a
part
of
the
stems
is
found
to
be
woody
the
hard
ends
should
not
be
rejected
for
the
outside
may
be
peeled
off
and
the
center
used
or
the
hard
ends
may
be
cooked
with
other
vegetables
for
the
making
of
soup
the
white
asparagus
will
have
slightly
green
tips
while
the
rest
of
the
stem
will
be
white
asparagus
is
one
of
the
succulent
vegetables
comparatively
low
in
food
value
it
contains
as
table
i
shows
only
as
many
calories
to
the
pound
as
potatoes
its
food
value
however
may
be
increased
by
dressing
it
with
butter
after
the
vegetable
has
been
cooked
or
by
serving
with
it
a
sauce
made
with
milk
butter
flour
etc
then
too
asparagus
is
sometimes
served
on
toast
which
is
another
means
of
making
a
more
nutritious
dish
out
of
this
vegetable
in
its
composition
asparagus
contains
a
that
is
a
substance
that
has
an
effect
upon
the
kidneys
and
that
is
known
as
because
of
the
presence
of
this
substance
asparagus
is
thought
to
be
injurious
to
those
who
have
kidney
trouble
but
it
need
not
be
avoided
except
in
some
forms
of
this
disease
preparation
for
to
prepare
asparagus
for
cooking
strip
the
tiny
scales
from
the
sides
of
the
stems
by
means
of
a
small
paring
knife
these
hold
sand
and
are
responsible
for
the
presence
of
the
grit
that
is
sometimes
found
in
a
cooked
dish
of
asparagus
even
when
the
housewife
feels
certain
that
she
has
washed
it
as
clean
as
possible
then
wash
the
stems
thoroughly
in
several
cold
waters
lifting
them
out
of
the
water
after
each
washing
instead
of
pouring
the
water
off
of
them
if
the
water
is
poured
off
the
stems
the
sand
that
has
been
washed
from
them
is
likely
to
remain
in
the
bottom
of
the
pan
and
mix
with
the
vegetable
again
when
the
asparagus
has
been
sufficiently
washed
it
may
be
used
in
the
full
lengths
or
cut
into
pieces
of
any
desired
length
inch
being
the
size
that
is
usually
preferred
if
stems
are
to
be
cooked
whole
it
is
a
good
plan
to
form
them
into
a
bunch
as
when
purchased
and
tie
the
bunch
with
a
tape
or
a
string
when
this
is
done
the
string
should
of
course
be
cut
and
removed
before
the
asparagus
is
served
a
point
to
remember
about
the
preparation
of
this
vegetable
is
that
it
should
always
be
cooked
in
boiling
salted
water
asparagus
with
butter
perhaps
the
simplest
way
in
which
to
prepare
asparagus
is
to
cook
it
in
salted
water
and
then
serve
it
with
a
butter
dressing
when
prepared
in
this
way
it
may
be
served
plain
but
it
becomes
more
attractive
as
well
as
more
nutritious
if
it
is
placed
on
squares
of
toast
for
this
dish
secure
a
bunch
of
fresh
tender
asparagus
wash
it
thoroughly
and
then
as
desired
cut
it
into
inch
lengths
or
allow
it
to
remain
whole
pour
enough
boiling
water
over
it
to
cover
well
add
salt
in
the
proportion
of
teaspoonful
to
each
quart
of
water
and
allow
it
to
cook
until
the
stems
may
be
easily
pierced
with
a
fork
which
in
most
cases
will
require
not
more
than
from
to
minutes
the
length
of
the
cooking
is
an
important
factor
with
this
vegetable
for
when
it
is
overcooked
its
flavor
is
not
so
agreeable
as
when
it
has
had
just
enough
cooking
when
the
asparagus
is
done
drain
off
the
water
season
with
a
little
more
salt
and
a
dash
of
pepper
and
if
it
is
to
be
served
without
toast
add
tablespoonful
of
butter
for
each
bunch
cooked
allowing
the
butter
to
melt
in
case
it
is
to
be
served
on
toast
allow
a
small
amount
of
the
liquid
in
which
it
was
cooked
to
remain
on
it
add
the
butter
to
this
and
after
placing
several
of
the
stems
or
a
number
of
the
pieces
on
the
squares
of
toast
dip
a
little
of
the
liquid
over
all
creamed
asparagus
on
a
still
more
nutritious
dish
can
be
prepared
from
asparagus
by
combining
it
with
a
cream
sauce
and
serving
it
on
toast
the
sauce
supplies
protein
and
fat
and
the
toast
furnishes
carbohydrate
substances
in
which
this
vegetable
is
low
numerous
ways
of
serving
this
combination
may
be
resorted
to
but
one
of
the
most
attractive
methods
is
illustrated
in
fig
as
here
shown
a
small
bunch
of
the
stems
is
slipped
through
a
ring
of
toast
cut
by
means
of
round
cutters
of
two
sizes
if
it
is
not
desired
to
use
toast
for
this
a
ring
of
lemon
rind
or
pimiento
may
be
substituted
or
the
ring
may
be
omitted
altogether
and
the
stems
merely
laid
in
an
orderly
manner
on
a
square
of
toast
also
with
this
dish
as
with
the
previous
one
the
asparagus
may
be
cut
into
inch
lengths
instead
of
being
cooked

well
while

beans
and
their
preparation
varieties
of
beans
of
all
the
vegetables
commonly
used
for
food
beans
afford
the
greatest
variety
however
there
are
two
principal
classes
into
which
all
varieties
of
this
vegetable
can
be
placed
namely
and
string
beans
include
both
the
pods
and
the
seeds
and
are
used
when
the
beans
are
very
young
shell
beans
consist
of
the
seeds
which
are
allowed
to
mature
either
partly
or
entirely
and
are
taken
from
the
shells
before
cooking
those
which
are
partly
developed
are
cooked
when
they
are
fresh
but
the
ones
that
are
allowed
to
mature
completely
are
dried
and
then
stored
for
use
at
any
time
during
the
year
in
some
cases
the
same
variety
of
beans
may
be
used
in
the
three
ways
mentioned
while
in
others
certain
kinds
are
raised
expressly
for
one
of
these
purposes
the
food
value
of
beans
increases
as
they
mature
as
will
be
observed
upon
reference
to
table
i
the
very
young
beans
that
is
the
string
beans
which
include
the
pods
and
all
are
comparatively
low
in
food
value

only
a

higher

fresh

have

than

whereas
dried

are
very
high
in

it
is
this
characteristic
of
dried

that
makes

a
very
good

substitute
string
beans
varieties
of
string
there
are
two
general
varieties
of
string
beans
the
yellow
ones
which
are
commonly
known
as
and
the
green
ones
which
are
the
ones
usually
meant
when
the
term
string
beans
is
used
numerous
varieties
exist
among
these
classes
and
some
are
very
much
better
than
others
many
of
them
have
strings
but
others
are
stringless
and
consequently
are
easier
to
prepare
whatever
kind
is
used
should
be
picked
from
the
vines
before
the
beans
are
old
enough
for
the
pods
to
develop
woody
fibers
otherwise
they
will
not
be
palatable
for
when
they
have
reached
this
stage
it
will
be
impossible
to
cook
them
soft
selection
and
small
round
spots
are
common
to
both
string
and
wax
beans
but
when
such
spots
are
present
they
must
be
removed
before
cooking
as
there
is
considerable
waste
in
the
preparation
of
such
beans
for
the
table
it
is
wise
in
buying
string
beans
to
select
those
whose
surface
is
not
marred
with
such
blemishes
in
addition
the
beans
should
be
as
fresh
as
can
be
obtained
and
crisp
and
tender
enough
to
snap
when
the
pods
are
bent
in
half
proper
attention
should
be
given
to
them
after
they
are
purchased
too
if
possible
they
should
be
cooked
immediately
but
if
this
can
not
be
done
they
should
be
kept
in
a
cool
damp
place
to
prevent
them
from
becoming
limp
however
if
they
wilt
before
they
can
be
cooked
they
may
be
freshened
by
allowing
them
to
stand
in
cold
water
for
a
short
time
preparation
and
to
prepare
beans
for
cooking
wash
them
thoroughly
in
cold
water
if
the
beans
are
of
the
stringless
variety
cut
off
the
stem
and
blossom
ends
but
in
case
they
have
strings
break
the
ends
and
strip
off
the
strings
together
with
the
ends
as
shown
in
fig
the
beans
may
then
be
cooked
whole
or
cut
into
inch
lengths
before
cooking
if
it
is
desired
to
cut
them
the
most
convenient
way
is
to
place
them
in
an
orderly
heap
on
a
cutting
board
and
then
cut
a
handful
at
a
time
drawing
a
sharp
knife
across
them
as
they
are
held
on
the
board
any
imperfect
portions
should
be
removed
before
cutting
the
cooking
of
string
beans
is
similar
to
that
of
asparagus
except
that
they
require
longer
cooking
put
them
either
whole
or
cut
into
a
kettle
cover
them
with
boiling
water
to
which
has
been
added
teaspoonful
of
salt
to
each
quart
of
water
and
cook
them
with
the
cover
on
the
kettle
until
they
can
be
easily
pierced
with
a
fork
the
length
of
time
required
to
cook
them
depends
on
the
age
of
the
beans
but
usually
from
minutes
to
hour
will
be
sufficient
when
they
are
done
drain
the
water
from
them
but
save
it
to
make
sauce
for
them

any
that

wash
the

in

they
may
then
be
cooked
without
further
preparation
but
in
order
to
hasten
their
cooking
and
save
fuel
in
their
preparation
it
is
a
good
plan
to
moisten
them
by
soaking
them
in
water
before
cooking
if
they
are
to
be
soaked
place
them
in
cold
water
and
allow
them
to
remain
there
for
to
hours
then
put
them
on
to
cook
in
water
to
which
has
been
added
a
small
pinch
of
soda
parboil
the
beans
in
this
water
until
the
outside
skin
begins
to
crack
and
then
pour
off
the
water
while
it
is
true
that
a
certain
amount
of
mineral
salts
and
perhaps
a
small
percentage
of
food
value
are
lost
in
this
procedure
because
the
water
that
is
poured
off
is
too
strong
to
be
used
for
any
other
purpose
the
improvement
in
the
flavor
warrants
any
loss
that
might
occur
after
pouring
off
the
water
wash
the
beans
in
cold
water
add
fresh
water
to
continue
the
cooking
and
allow
the
beans
to
simmer
slowly
until
they
are
cooked
soft
enough
to
crush
between
the
fingers
but
still
retain
their
original
shape
nothing
is
gained
by
cooking
them
rapidly
on
a
hot
fire
and
considerable
fuel
is
wasted
by
this
practice
the
fireless
cooker
and
the
double
boiler
are
excellent
utensils
for
the
cooking
of
dried
beans
because
they
cook
the
beans
at
a
temperature
below
boiling
point
they
therefore
cook
the
beans
soft
with
little
difficulty
and
prevent
the
protein
from
becoming
hard
the
theory
of
the
cooking
of
protein
that
is
the
higher
the
temperature
the
harder
the
coagulation
applies
in
the
cooking
of
dried

it

may
be

in
various
ways

the
simplest
method
is
to
stew
them

preparation
of
this
dish
as
well
as
any
other
made
from

beets
and
their
preparation
beets
are
a
root
vegetable
that
comes
in
two
varieties
and
the
red
beets
are
more
popular
for
cooking
than
the
white
ones
and
of
these
the
ones
that
retain
their
color
after
cooking
are
preferable
to
any
other
the
root
however
is
not
the
only
part
of
this
plant
that
is
eaten
for
the
tops
are
also
much
used
for
food
when
the
tops
are
to
be
cooked
the
plants
are
usually
not
allowed
to
mature
to
the
extent
that
the
root
parts
can
be
used
still
early
in
the
summer
when
very
small
beets
are
to
be
had
with
the
tops
on
both
the
tops
and
the
beets
may
be
used
at
this
age
the
beets
are
very
tender
and
do
not
require
long
cooking
if
the
beets
are
not
eaten
when
they
are
young
they
are
allowed
to
mature
in
the
ground
and
are
then
pulled
in
the
fall
and
stored
for
a
winter
vegetable
like
other
root
vegetables
beets
contain
very
little
protein
and
fat
but
in
their
composition
is
included
a
fairly
large
percentage
of
carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
sugar
their
total

is
greater
than
that

when
beets
are
selected
as

with
the
idea
of
using
both

cabbage
is
a
vegetable
that
has
many
uses
and
is
eaten
both
raw

numerous
opinions
exist
about
the
difference
in

between
raw
and
cooked
cabbage
as
well
as
the
best
ways
in
which
to
cook
this
vegetable
it
may
be
true
that
in
some
cases
raw
cabbage
does
not
cause
the
disagreeable
effect
that
cooked
cabbage
often
does
but
the
reason
for
this
is
that
cabbage
when
raw
has
a
milder
flavor
than
when
cooked
cabbage
generally
developing
during
the
cooking
a
strong
flavor
that
causes
trouble
the
flavor
of
cabbage
however
may
be
dissipated
if
attention
is
given
to
the
cooking
so
that
when
properly
prepared
cabbage
can
be
eaten
with
little
fear
of
indigestion
when
cabbage
is
cooked
it
is
usually
boiled
like
other
vegetables
that
is
it
is
covered
well
with
boiling
water

which
teaspoonful
of
salt
is
added
for
each
quart
and
then
allowed
to
boil
until
it
can
be
easily
pierced
with
a
fork
its
cooking
differs
however
from
that
of
many
vegetables
string
beans
for
instance
in
that
it
is
carried
on
with
the
cover
removed
from
the
kettle
this
plan
permits
of
the
evaporation
of
much
of
the
strong
flavor
which
arises
in
the
steam
and
which
would
otherwise
be
reabsorbed
by
the
cabbage
since
it
is
the
retention
of
this
flavor
together
with
long
cooking
that
causes
this
vegetable
to
disagree
with
persons
who
eat
it
both
of
these
points
should
be
carefully
watched
if
it
is
cooked
in
an
open
vessel
and
it
is
boiled
just
long
enough
to
be
tender
so
that
when
done
it
is
white
and
and
not
in
any
way
discolored
an
easily
digested
dish
will
be
the
result

cabbage
will
cook
sufficiently
in

often
in

are
one
of
the
root

to

practically
the

upon

they
can

they
are
also
much

served
in

they
make

selection
and
the
selection
of
carrots
is
a
simple
matter
because
they
keep
well
and
are
not
likely
to
be
found
in
a
spoiled
condition
in
the
market
when
small
summer
carrots
are
purchased
they
should
be
fresh
and
should
have
their
tops
on

carrots
should
be
as
nearly
uniform
in
size
as
possible
and
should
not
be
extremely
large
those
which
are
too
large
in

are
likely
to
have
a
hollow
in
the
center
and
are
not
nearly
so
desirable
as
thin

that

caused
by
exposure
to

light
in

in
preparing

for

they
should
be
scraped
rather
than
peeled

avoid
wasting
any
of
the
vegetable
they
are
always
cooked
in
boiling

water
after
which
they
can
be
treated
in
various
ways
the
water
in
which
carrots
are
cooked
should
not
be
thrown
away
as
it
may
be
used
to
flavor

remain
after

they
may

the

the
food
value
of

which
is
very
high
even
exceeding
that

is
due
principally
to
the
carbohydrate
it
contains
this

substance
is
in
the
form
of
sugar
in
the
green
kernels
but
as
they
mature
it
changes
to
starch
the
food
value
of
the
dry
grain
is
therefore
higher
and
the
carbohydrate
is
in

form

the

entirely
encased
in

layers
of
husks
these
are
not

is
to
be
cooked

when
this

the

are
allowed
to

the
condition
of

can
be
determined
by
stripping
the

down
a
little
and
examining
the
kernels
if
they
are
well

they
may
be

and
their
preparation
the
fruit
of

plant

used
from
time
immemorial
as
a
vegetable
in
food
value
cucumbers
are
very
low
comparing
closely
with
celery
in
this
respect
however
as
they
contain
a
large
amount
of
cellulose
or
bulk
and
mineral
salts
they
should
not
be
disregarded
in
the
diet
they
have
a
rather
strong
flavor
due
to
their
volatile
oils
which
so
frequently
disagree
with
persons
and
which
give
cucumbers
a
reputation
for
being
difficult
to
digest
however
when

properly
prepared
they
can
be
eaten
by
most
persons

the
custom
to

water
before

them
this
procedure
however
has
been
found
to
be
poor
policy
for
nothing
is
gained
by
it

the
salt
toughens
the
cellulose
and
makes
the
cucumbers
limp
and
rubbery
in
texture
a
much
more
satisfactory
way
to
prepare
cucumbers
is
to
slice
them
and
then
soak
them
for
some
time
before
serving
in
ice
water
or
water
as
cold
as
can
be
obtained
they
will
then
become
crisp

delicious

besides
being
more
appetizing
and
agreeable
they
will
be
no
less
digestible

the
cooking
of
greens
both
wild

is
not
only
simple
but
practically
the
same
for
all
varieties
when
they
are
not
used
as
a
salad
vegetable
they
are
merely
boiled
until
tender
and
then
dressed
in
any
desired
way
some
kinds
admit
of
special
preparation
and
wherever
this
is
the
case
specific
directions
are
given
under
the
particular
variety
but
even
in
such
an

many
times
as
seems
necessary
to
remove
all
the
sand

an
important
point
to
remember
is
that
the
greens
should
not
be
cleansed
by
pouring
the
water
off
as
the
sand
will
then
remain
in

thoroughly
washed
put
them
on
to
cook
in

a
similar
utensil

they
should

added
to
start
the
cooking

parsley
while
classified
as
a
green
vegetable
is
perhaps
not
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
a
real
vegetable
since
it
is
used
for
only
two
purposes
and
in
neither
of
these
is
it
served
cooked
or
raw
as
an
exclusive
article
of
diet
the
most
important
use
of

is
perhaps
that
of
flavoring
it
is
added
to
soups
sauces
and
various
kinds
of
cooked
vegetables
in
order
to
impart
additional

may
also
be
dried
before

it
must
be
kept
for
any
length
of

the
other
use
of

is
that
of

often
used
in
small
sprays
to
garnish

roast
of
meat
a
steak
chops
fish

and
must
therefore
be

lentils
and
their
preparation
lentils
are
the
flattish
circular
dried
seeds
of
an
annual
vine
grown
chiefly
in
europe
and
asia
they
belong
to
the
class
of
vegetables
known
as
legumes
and
are
therefore
high
in
protein
in
the
form
of
legumin
they
also
contain
a
large
amount
of
carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
starch
and
are
high
in
mineral
salts
because
of
their
high
food
value
which
is
somewhat
over
calories
to
the
pound
they
are
a
valuable
food
in
the
diet
particularly
as
a
meat
substitute
consequently
when
lentils
can
be
obtained
at
a
reasonable
price
it
is
wise
to
make
considerable
use
of
them
there
are
three
varieties
of
lentils
and
and
they
resemble
split
peas
in
appearance
as
will
be
observed
from
fig
which
shows
a
panful
of
dried
lentils
they
have
a
distinctive
flavor
that
is
agreeable
to
most
persons
however
like
other
dried
legumes
long
cooking
is
required
to
make
them
tender
and
palatable
cooking
of
in
general
the
preparation
of
lentils
is
similar
to
that
of
dried
beans
the
cooking
of
which
is
now
thoroughly
understood
they
may
be
put
on
to
cook
immediately
after
they
are
washed
but
as
in
the
case
of
dried
beans
their
cooking
may
be
hastened
if
they
are
first
softened
by
soaking
them
in
cold
water
for
to
hours
at
the
end
of
this
time
it
is
advisable
to
parboil
the
lentils
for
about
or
minutes
or
until
their
outer
skins
begin
to
crack
in
water
to
which
a
pinch
of
soda
has
been
added
this
water
being
poured
off
the
lentils
should
be
washed
and
then
put
to
cook
in
fresh
water
to
which
teaspoonful
of
salt
is
added
for
each
quart
of
water
used
like
beans
the
lentils
should
be
cooked
slowly
until
they
are
soft
enough
to
crush
between
the
fingers
with
these
principles
for
the
cooking
of
lentils
well
in

the
housewife
will
have
no
difficulty
in
preparing
this
vegetable

gummy
consistency

if
it

is
so
strong

somewhat
irritating

which
causes

to
disagree
with
many

this

can
be
almost
entirely
dissipated
by

some
persons
believe
that

value

there

are
especially
popular

many
varieties
which
vary
in
flavor

in
color
some
of
the
dried
ones
being
yellow
some
red
and
others
white
all
dried
onions
have
excellent
keeping

so
after
purchasing
no
special
care
need
be
given
to
them
except
to
store
them

deterioration
is

to

the

the
variety

very
much
desired
by
the
people

ranker
it
is
little
used
by

as
a
flavoring
for

various
kinds
of
highly
seasoned
meats
in
reality
a
very
small
amount
of
garlic
is
sufficient
to
lend
enough
flavor

so
the
bowl
in
which
a
salad
is

is
often
merely
rubbed
with
garlic
before

parsnips
are
an
important
root
vegetable
being
closely
allied
to
carrots
they
are
used
to
a
certain
extent
during
the
summer
when
they
are
immature
but
generally
they
are
allowed
to
mature
so
that
they
may
be
stored
for
use
as
a
winter
vegetable
parsnips
have
an
advantage
over
many
vegetables
in
that
they
have
excellent
keeping
qualities
and
are
particularly
hardy
being
able
to
withstand
considerable
freezing
and
thawing
when
they
are
left
in
the
ground
during
the
winter
however
as
they
grow
older
they
develop
a
woody
texture
as
do
beets
and
turnips
and
so
at
the
end
of
the
winter
require
longer
cooking
than
at
the
beginning
in
food
value
parsnips
are
somewhat
higher
than
other
root
vegetables
containing
a
large
amount
of
carbohydrate
which
occurs
in
the
form
of
sugar
although
they
are
wholesome
and
nourishing
they
have
a
peculiar
sweetish
flavor
that
is
due
to
the
volatile
oil
they
contain
and
is
objectionable
to
some
persons
still
those
who
are
fond
of
this
flavor
find
that
parsnips
afford
an
excellent
opportunity
to
give
variety
to
the
diet
for
they
may
be
prepared
in
a
number
of
ways

them
so
as

waste
any
of
the
edible
material
then
too
try

obtain
parsnips
for
they
will
be
of
much
better
quality
than
the
larger
ones
if
uneven
sizes
must
be
used
the
larger
ones
should
be
cut
before
being
cooked

that
they
will
be
similar
in
size
to
the
smaller
ones
and
therefore
cook

there
is
a
decided
difference
between
the
two
varieties
of
peas
the
green
ones
being
about
equal
to
green
corn
in
food
value

the
dried
ones
having
a
food
value
nearly
four
times
as
great
in

case
the
food
substance
in
the
greatest
amount
is
in
the
form
of
carbohydrate
in
green
peas
this
is
in
the
form
of
sugar
while
in
dried
ones
it
is
changed
into
starch
peas
also
contain
protein
in
the
form
of
legumin
there
being
three
times
as
much
of
this
substance
in
dried
peas
as
in
green
ones
the
amount
found
in
green
peas
is
sufficient
to
be
of
importance
in
the
diet
but
the
percentage
of
this
substance
is
so
great
in
dried
peas
that
they
may
be
used
very
satisfactorily
as
a
meat
substitute
green
numerous
varieties
of
green
peas
are
found
on
the
market
a
few
of
them
are
cooked
in

pods

when
the
peas
are
very
young

all
just
as
are
string
beans
most
of
them
however
are
allowed
to
mature
further
and
only
the
peas
are
eaten
the
shell
being
discarded
when
green
peas
are
purchased
they
are
always
found
in
the
pods
for
the
peas
to
be
most
satisfactory
the
pods
should
be
fresh
and
green
and
should
appear
to
be
well
filled
pods
mean
that
the
peas
have
not
matured
sufficiently
after
being
purchased
the
peas
should
not
be
removed
from
the
pods
until
they
are
to
be
cooked
however
if
it
is
necessary
that
they
stand
for
any
length
of
time
after
they
are
shelled
they
should
be
kept
in
a
cool
place
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
shriveling
their
cooking
is
similar
to
that
of
any
other
fresh

a
different
kind

fact
their
cooking
is
similar
to
that
of

require
long
slow
cooking

are
improved
if

peppers
and

peppers
are
one
of
the
fruit
vegetables
some
varieties
of
them
are
dried
and
used
as
a
condiment
that
is
to
season
or
give
relish
to
food
but
as
they
are
never
used
as
a
vegetable
they
are
not
included
here
it
is
the
sweet
varieties
of
peppers
which
are
used
as
vegetables
and
to
which
reference
is
made
in
these
discussions
they
are
valuable
chiefly
for
two
reasons
to
flavor
various
kinds
of
dishes
such
as
entrées
salads
and
to
make
a
dish
more
attractive
in
appearance
because
of
the
contrast
in
color
they
afford
in
food
value
they
are
about
equal
to
the
various
greens
but
as
a
rule
such
small
quantities
of
them
are
eaten
that
they
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
food
stuffed
the
usual
way
of
preparing
peppers
as
a
vegetable
is
to
stuff
them

them

they
form
such
an
extensive
part
of

of
the
majority
of
people
that
they
are
generally
considered
the
most
important
vegetable
used
by
civilized
man
they
are
usually
roundish
or
oblong
in
shape
and
have
a
whitish
interior

irish
potatoes
are
comparatively
high
being
in
this
respect
about
two
and
times
as
great
as
an
equal
weight
of
cabbage
but
not
quite
twice
as
great
as
the
various
root
vegetables
such
as
carrots
parsnips
etc
the
largest
amount
of
this
food
value
occurs
as
carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
starch
there
being
almost
no
fat
and
very
little
protein
in
potatoes
the
starch
granules
of
potatoes
are
larger
than
the
starch
granules
of
any
of
the
cereals
the
class
of
foods
highest
in
this
food
substance
and
it
is
the
proper
cooking
of
this
starch
that
makes
potatoes
dry
and
mealy
potatoes
also
contain
a
large
amount
of
mineral
salts
much
of
which
lies
directly
under
the
skin
therefore
the
most
economical
way
in
which
to
prepare
potatoes
is
to
cook
them
with
the
skins
on
for
then
all
of
the
mineral
salts
are
retained
and
none
of
the
material
is
wasted
selection
of
the
new
potato
crop
begins
to
come
into
the
market
during
the
summer
when
potatoes
are
especially
appetizing
however
as
potatoes
can
be
easily
stored
and
kept
very
well
for
a
considerable
time
they
form
a
large
part
of
the
winter
food
supply
if
there
is
sufficient
storage
space
it
is
a
wise
plan
to
buy
a
large
enough
supply
of
potatoes
in
the
fall
to
last
for
several
months
and
then
to
store
them
for
the
winter
however
when
this
is
done
care
should
be
taken
in
the
selection
in
the
first
place
the
outside
skin
should
be
smooth
and
not
scaly
then
if
possible
potatoes
of
medium
size
should
be
selected
rather
than
small
ones
or
large
ones
the
small
ones
are
not
so
satisfactory
because
of
the
greater
proportion
of
waste
in
peeling
while
the
very
large
ones
are
apt
to
have
a
hollow
space
in
the
center
to
judge
the
quality
of
potatoes
a
few
of
those
to
be
purchased
should
be
secured
and
cooked
before
a
large
number
of
them
are
bought
the
soil
and
climatic
conditions
affect
the
quality
of
potatoes
to
such
an
extent
that
a
particular
kind
of
potato
which
may
have
been
excellent
last
year
may
be
entirely
different
in
quality
this
year
a
housewife
can
not
therefore
be
guided
entirely
by
her
previous
knowledge
of
a
certain
kind
of
potato
care
of
potatoes
bought
in
quantity
should
be
kept
in
a
cool
place
and
should
be
excluded
from
the
light
such
care
will
usually
prevent
them
from
discoloring
and
sprouting
in
case
they
should
sprout
the
sprouts
should
be
removed
at
once
for
the
potatoes

such
a

the

they
may
be
thawed
by
putting
them
in
cold

such
potatoes
which
are
characterized
by
a
peculiar
sweetish
taste
should
be
used
as
soon
as
possible
after

of

already

when
it
is
desired

to
choose
for

that

is
about
degrees

as
that
for

is
the
preferable

sweet
potatoes
resemble
white
ones
except
that
a
part
of

is
in

serve
hot
radishes
and
their
preparation
radishes
are
a
root
vegetable
used
almost
exclusively
as
a
relish
or
to
lend
flavor
to
a
mixture
they
are
easily
and
successfully
grown
and
are
plentiful
and
cheap
except
when
they
are
out
of
season
and
must
be
raised
in
hothouses
numerous
varieties
of
radishes
differing
from
one
another
in
size
shape
and
color
are
raised
the
red
ones
are
generally
preferred
because
they
lend
color
to
a
dish
or
a
meal
but
the
white
and
brown
varieties
are
just
as
desirable
so
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
radishes
contain
very
little
food
value
being
about
equal
to
celery
and
cucumbers
in
this
respect
they
do
not
supply
anything
valuable
to
a
meal
except
mineral
salts
although
some
persons
consider
radishes
difficult
to
digest
they
contain
almost
nothing
that
has
to
be
digested
for
they
are
composed
largely
of
cellulose
which
does
not
digest
and
water
radishes
disagree
with
some
persons
because
like
onions
and
cabbage
they
contain
a
strong
volatile
oil
that
gives
them
their
flavor
since
radishes
are
always
eaten
raw
they
require
very
little
in
the
way
of
preparation
the
principal
thing
is
to
see
that
they
are
perfectly
clean
and
as
crisp
as
possible
to
make
them
crisp
allow
them
to
stand
in
cold
water
for
some
time
before
using
them
then
remove
the
tops
and
the
roots
and
scrub
thoroughly
with
a
vegetable
brush
the
small
red
radishes
can
be
made
very
attractive
by
cutting
the
skin
in
sections
to
resemble
the
petals
of
a
rose
when
prepared
in
this
way
a
small
portion
of
the
green
top
is
allowed
to
remain
salsify
and
its
preparation
salsify
is
a
root
vegetable
resembling
in
food
value
such
other
root
vegetables
as
carrots
and
parsnips
because
it
has
a
flavor
similar
to
that
of
oysters
especially
when
it
is
used
for
soup
it
has
received
the
name
of
it
consists
of
long
slender
roots
that
are
covered
with
tiny
roots
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
clean
and
prepare
but
as
it
may
be
stored
through
the
entire
winter
and
is
particularly
desirable
for
the
making
of
soup
it
is
a
valuable
vegetable
in
preparing
salsify
for
cooking
scrape
the
roots
rather
than
peel
them
then
put
them
in
a
solution
of
cold
salt
water
made
by
using
teaspoonful
of
salt
to
each
quart
of
water
and
keep
them
there
until
ready
to
cook
them
this
precaution
will
to
a
certain
extent
prevent
the
discoloration
that
always
takes
place
in
salsify
as
soon
as
the
skin
is
removed
when
thus
prepared
salsify
lends
itself
to
the
same
forms
of
preparation
as
do
the
other
root
vegetables

the
simplest
way
in
which

preparation
summer
squash
summer
squash
is
a
fruit
vegetable
belonging
to
the
same
class
as
eggplant
peppers
etc
and
occurring
in
many
varieties
the
different
kinds
of
this
vegetable
vary
greatly
in
size
shape
and
color
but
all
of
them
may
be
prepared
in
practically
the
same
way
and
used
for
the
same
purposes
they
get
their
name
from
the
fact
that
they
are
grown
and
used

they
must
be
used
at
this

they
do
not
permit

summer
squash
contains
a
great
deal
of
water
and
for
this
reason
its
food
value
is
very
low
being
about
equal
to
that
of
lettuce
celery
etc
because
of
the
large
percentage
of
water
in
its
composition
as
little
water
as
possible
should
be
added
in
its
cooking
or
the
result

be
a
vegetable
so
watery
as
to
be
unattractive
and
unpalatable
another
precaution
that
should
be
taken
in
its
preparation
is
to
remove
the
seeds
and
the
skins
many
housewives
think
it
unnecessary
to
do
this
for
both
the
skins
and
the

be

larger

have

hard

they
contain
less
water

are
usually
taken

tomatoes
and
their
preparation
tomatoes
are
a
fruit
vegetable
that
may
be
either
cooked
or
prepared
raw
in
many
different
ways
they
are
usually
red
when
ripe
and
because
of
this
color
they
are
particularly
attractive
on
the
table
green
or
partly
ripe
tomatoes
are
also
used
in
the
preparation
of
many
dishes
tomatoes
are
composed
largely
of
water
and
for
this
reason
their
food
value
is
low
being
about
the
same
as
that
of
greens
this
large
proportion
of
water
is
also
responsible
for
the
fact
that
they
do
not
keep
for
a
great
length
of
time
tomatoes
however
have
a
long
season
they
begin
to
appear
in
the
market
early
in
the
spring
and
they
may
be
obtained
from
this
time
until
the
frost
kills
the
vines
in
the
fall
while
tomatoes
appeal
to
the
majority
of
persons
they
disagree
with
some
on
account
of
the
acid
they
contain
this
acid
is
similar
to
that
found
in
some
fruits
and
it
is
present
in
greater
quantity
in
cooked
tomatoes
than
in
raw
ones
the
heating
of
the
vegetable
apparently
increasing
the
acidity
this
acidity
of
tomatoes
may
be
reduced
by
the
addition
of
soda
and
while
soda
produces
a
marked
change
in
the
flavor
it
is
necessary
in
the
preparation
of
some
dishes
for
instance
in
the
case
of
soup
soda
must
be
added
to
reduce
the
acidity
and
thus
keep
the
milk
or
cream
used
in
preparing
this
dish
from
curdling
the
skin
of
tomatoes
whether
they
are
to
be
eaten
raw
or
cooked
is
usually
undesirable
therefore
in
preparing
tomatoes
for
the
table
the
skins
are
generally
removed
in
order
to
do
this
first
dip
the
tomatoes
into
boiling
water
for
several
seconds
and
then
immediately
into
cold
water
this
will
loosen
the
skins
which
may
then
be
peeled
off
very
thinly

very
little
of
the
tomato
will
be
wasted

the
usual
way
of
preparing
tomatoes
is
to
stew
them
stewed
tomatoes
may
be
served
plain

be
improved
very
decidedly
by

cubes
of

turnips
and
their
preparation
turnips
which
are
a
root
vegetable
occur
in
two
varieties
and
the
white
ones
are
commonly
known
as
and
the
yellow
ones
are
called
although
differing
in
color
both
varieties
have
much
the
same
flavor
and
may
be
prepared
in
the
same
ways
therefore
whenever
a
recipe
calls
for
turnips
rutabagas
may
be
used
as
well
in
food
value
turnips
are
similar
to
beets
carrots
and
parsnips
they
have
a
strong
flavor
which
is
disliked
by
many
persons
and
disagrees
with
some
however
much
of
this
can
be
dissipated
by
cooking
them
with
the
cover
of
the
kettle
removed
so
that
when
properly
prepared
they
furnish
a
pleasant
variety
to
the
winter
menu
they
have
good
storing
qualities
and
can
be
kept
very
easily
through
the
winter
toward
spring
it
is
more
difficult
to
cook
them
soft
as
the
cellulose
in
them
becomes
harder
and
they
are
likely
to
develop
woody
fiber
in
preparing
turnips
for
cooking
scrub
them
until
thoroughly
clean
and
then

hot
vegetable
combinations
the
recipes
given
for
the
various
kinds
of
vegetables
pertain
in
most
cases
to
merely
one
vegetable
and
this
is
the
way
in
which
this
food
is
usually
prepared
however
there
are
times
when
it
is
an
advantage
to
combine
two
or
more
vegetables
for
instance
it
is
sometimes
desired
to
give
additional
variety
to
the
menu
or
to
utilize
small
quantities
of
vegetable
that
alone
would
not
be
sufficient
to
serve
the
family
then
again
two
vegetables
are
often
prepared
together
in

serving

the
way
in
which
vegetables
are

depends
largely
on
the
method
of
preparation
however
a
point
that
should
never
be
neglected
so
far
as
cooked
vegetables
are
concerned
no
matter
what
plan
of
serving
is
followed
is
to
see
that
they
are
always
served
hot
to
make
this
possible
the
dishes
in
which
they
are
served
should
be
heated
before
the
vegetables
are
put
into
them
and
should
be
kept
hot
until
put
on
the
table
when
a
vegetable
dish
has
a
cover
the
cover
should
be
kept
on
until
the
vegetable
is
served
and
should
be
replaced
after
the
first
serving
so
as
to
keep
the
remainder
hot
because
of
the
possible
variety
in
the
preparation
of
this
class
of
foods
numerous
ways
of
serving
them
are
in
practice
when
a
vegetable
is
baked
in
a
large
baking
dish
the
dish
should
be
placed
on
the
table
and
the
vegetable
served
from
it
either
on
the
plate
or
in
individual
dishes
if
individual
baking
dishes
are
used
these
should
be
set
on
small
plates
and
one
put
at

boiled
or
creamed
vegetables
may
be
served
at
the

from
a

dish
being
put

or
in
small
dishes
or
they
may
be
served
in
individual
dishes
in
the
kitchen
and
a
dish
placed
at
the
left
of
each
place
when
the
large
dish
or
the
baking
dish
is
placed
on
the
table
it
should
be
placed
where
the
vegetable
may
be
conveniently
served
by
the
host
if
it
is
to
be
put
on
the
dinner
plate

it
is
to
be

in

dishes
at

in
addition
to
being
served
in
these
ways
vegetables
also
lend
themselves
to
various
attractive
methods
of
serving
for
instance
a
vegetable
prepared
with
a
sauce
is
frequently
served
in
patty
shells
timbale
cases
or
croustades
when
this
is
done
the
case
in
which
the
vegetable
is
served
is
as
a
rule
placed
directly
on
the
dinner
plate
potatoes
that
have
been
mashed
are
often
forced
through
a
pastry
tube
either
to
garnish
another
dish
or
to
make
a
dish
of
potatoes
more
attractive
for
instance
when
mashed
potatoes
are
to
be
served
a
solid
foundation
of
the
potato
may
be
arranged
in
the
center
of
a
dish
and
a
little
of
the
mashed
potato
then
forced
through
the
tube
to
make
a
design
over
the

before
being

should
be
