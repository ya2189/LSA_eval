illustrated
preface
the
life
of
benjamin
franklin
is
stranger
than
fiction
its
realities
surpass
the
idealities
of
novelists
imagination
would
scarcely
venture
to
portray
such
victories
over
poverty
obscurity
difficulties
and
hardships
the
tact
application
perseverance
and
industry
that
he
brought
to
his
make
him
an
example
for
all
time
he
met
with
defeats
but
they
inspired
him
to
manlier
efforts
his
successes
increased
his
desire
for
something
higher
and
nobler
he
was
satisfied
only
with
up
still
he
believed
that
one
is
worth
two
and
he
acted
accordingly
with
the
and
printing
office
for
his
and
observation
for
his
teacher
his
career
furnishes
one
of
the
noblest
examples
of
success
for
the
young
of
both
sexes
to
study
we
offer
his
life
as
one
of
the
brightest
and
best
in
american
history
to
inspire
young
hearts
with
lofty
aims
the
first
and
principal
source
of
material
for
this
book
was
autobiography
no
other
authority
or
treasure
of
material
can
take
the
place
of
that
biographies
by
sparks
sargent
abbott
and
parton
have
freely
consulted
together
with
franklin
in
france
and
various
eulogies
and
essays
upon
his
life
and
character
that
franklin
was
the
real
father
of
the
american
union
is
the
view
which
the
author
of
this
biography
presents
it
is
the
view
of
bancroft
as
follows
not
half
of
franklin
merits
have
been
told
he
was
the
true
father
of
the
american
union
it
was
he
who
went
forth
to
lay
the
foundation
of
that
great
design
at
albany
and
in
new
york
he
lifted
up
his
voice
here
among
us
he
appeared
as
the
apostle
of
the
union
it
was
franklin
who
suggested
the
congress
of
and
but
for
his
wisdom
and
the
confidence
that
wisdom
inspired
it
is
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
that
congress
would
have
taken
effect
it
was
franklin
who
suggested
the
bond
of
the
union
which
binds
these
states
from
florida
to
maine
franklin
was
the
greatest
diplomatist
of
the
eighteenth
century
he
never
spoke
a
word
too
soon
he
never
spoke
a
word
too
much
he
never
failed
to
speak
the
right
word
at
the
right
season
the
closing
years
of
franklin
life
were
so
identified
with
the
union
of
the
states
and
the
election
and
inauguration
of
washington
as
the
first
president
that
his
biography
becomes
a

i

persecution
under
the
reign
of
our
corrupt
king
said
a
neighbor
to
josiah
franklin
one
day
in
the
year
in
the
usually
quiet
village
of
banbury
england
and
i
believe
that
i
shall
pull
up
stakes
and
emigrate
to
boston
that
is
the
most
thriving
port
in
america
well
i
am
not
quite
prepared
for
that
yet
replied
franklin
our
king
is
bad
enough
and
tyrannical
enough
to
make
us
all
sick
of
our
native
land
but
it
is
a
great
step
to
leave
it
forever
to
live
among
strangers
and
i
could
not
decide
to
do
it
without
a
good
deal
of
reflection
nor
i
but
i
have
reflected
upon
it
for
a
whole
year
now
and
the
more
i
reflect
the
more
i
am
inclined
to
emigrate
when
i
ca
worship
god
here
as
my
conscience
dictates
i
will
go
where
i
can
besides
i
think
the
new
country
promises
much
more
to
the
common
people
than
the
old
in
the
way
of
a
livelihood
perhaps
so
i
have
not
given
the
subject
much
attention
dissenters
have
a
hard
time
here
under
charles
ii
and
we
all
have
to
work
hard
enough
for
a
livelihood
i
do
not
think
you
can
have
a
harder
time
in
boston
josiah
franklin
was
not
disposed
to
emigrate
when
his
neighbor
first
opened
the
subject
he
was
an
intelligent
enterprising
christian
man
a
dyer
by
trade
was
born
in
ecton
leicestershire
in
but
removed
to
banbury
in
his
boyhood
to
learn
the
business
of
a
dyer
of
his
brother
john
he
was
married
in
banbury
at
years
of
age
his
wife
being
an
excellent
companion
for
him
whether
in
prosperity
or
adversity
at
home
among
kith
and
kin
or
with
strangers
in
new
england
you
better
consider
this
matter
seriously
continued
the
neighbor
for
several
families
will
go
i
think
if
one
goes
a
little
colony
of
us
will
make
it
comparatively
easy
to
leave
home
for
a
new
country
very
true
that
would
be
quite
an
inducement
to
exchange
countries
several
families
going
together
responded
franklin
i
should
enjoy
escaping
from
the
oppression
of
the
established
church
as
much
as
you
but
it
is
a
too
important
step
for
me
to
take
without
much
consideration
it
appears
to
me
that
my
business
could
not
be
as
good
in
a
new
country
as
it
is
in
this
old
country
i
do
not
see
why
exactly
people
in
a
new
country
must
have
dyeing
done
perhaps
not
so
much
of
it
as
the
people
of
an
old
country
but
the
population
of
a
new
place
like
boston
increases
faster
than
the
older
places
of
our
country
and
this
fact
would
offset
the
objection
you
name
in
part
perhaps
if
benjamin
could
go
i
should
almost
feel
that
i
must
go
but
i
suppose
it
is
entirely
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
go
benjamin
was
an
older
brother
of
josiah
who
went
to
learn
the
trade
of
a
dyer
of
his
brother
john
before
josiah
did
the
benjamin
franklin
of
this
volume
our
young
hero
was
named
for
him
he
was
a
very
pious
man
who
rendered
unto
god
the
things
that
are
god
with
full
as
much
care
as
he
rendered
unto
caesar
the
things
that
are
caesar
he
was
a
very
intelligent
bright
man
also
quite
a
poet
for
that
day
and
he
invented
a
style
of
writing
that
he
used
in
taking
down
sermons
to
which
he
listened
in
this
way
he
accumulated
several
volumes
of
sermons
which
he
held
as
treasures
i
have
not
spoken
with
your
brother
about
the
matter
replied
the
neighbor
i
think
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
him
to
arrange
to
go
than
for
most
of
us
at
least
for
the
present
i
intend
to
speak
with
him
about
it
he
will
not
want
me
to
go
if
he
can
not
added
josiah
and
i
shall
think
about
it
a
good
while
before
i
should
conclude
to
go
without
him
we
have
been
together
most
of
our
lives
and
to
separate
now
probably
never
to
meet
again
would
be
too
great
a
trial
you
will
experience
greater
trials
than
that
if
you
live
long
no
doubt
said
the
neighbor
but
i
want
you
should
think
the
matter
over
and
see
if
it
will
not
be
for
your
interest
to
make
this
change
i
will
see
you
again
about
it
while
plans
are
being
matured
we
will
see
what
doctor
franklin
said
in
his
autobiography
about
his
ancestors
at
ecton
some
notes
which
one
of
my
uncles
who
had
the
same
curiosity
in
collecting
family
anecdotes
once
put
into
my
hands
furnished
me
with
several
particulars
relative
to
our
ancestors
from
these
notes
i
learned
that
they
lived
in
the
same
village
ecton
in
northamptonshire
on
a
freehold
of
about
thirty
acres
for
at
least
three
hundred
years
and
how
much
longer
could
not
be
ascertained
this
small
estate
would
not
have
sufficed
for
their
maintenance
without
the
business
of
a
smith
blacksmith
which
had
continued
in
the
family
down
to
my
time
the
eldest
son
being
always
brought
up
to
that
employment
a
custom
which
he
and
my
father
followed
with
regard
to
their
eldest
sons
when
i
searched
the
records
in
ecton
i
found
an
account
of
their
marriages
and
burials
from
the
year
only
as
the
registers
kept
did
not
commence
previous
thereto
i
however
learned
from
it
that
i
was
the
youngest
son
of
the
youngest
son
for
five
generations
back
my
grandfather
thomas
who
was
born
in
lived
in
ecton
till
he
was
too
old
to
continue
his
business
when
he
retired
to
banbury
oxfordshire
to
the
house
of
his
son
john
with
whom
my
father
served
an
apprenticeship
there
my
uncle
died
and
lies
buried
we
saw
his
in
his
eldest
son
thomas
lived
in
the
house
at
ecton
and
left
it
with
the
land
to
his
only
daughter
who
with
her
husband
one
fisher
of
wellingborough
sold
it
to
ioted
now
lord
of
the
manor
there
my
grandfather
had
four
sons
who
grew
up
viz
thomas
john
benjamin
and
josiah
i
do
not
know
how
you
like
it
but
it
arouses
my
indignation
to
have
our
meeting
broken
up
as
it
was
last
week
remarked
josiah
franklin
to
the
aforesaid
neighbor
a
short
time
after
their
previous
interview
if
anything
will
make
me
exchange
banbury
for
boston
it
is
such
intolerance
i
have
felt
like
that
for
a
long
time
and
i
should
not
have
thought
of
leaving
my
native
land
but
for
such
oppression
replied
the
neighbor
and
what
is
worse
i
see
no
prospect
of
any
improvement
on
the
other
hand
it
appears
to
me
that
our
rights
will
be
infringed
more
and
more
i
am
going
to
new
england
if
i
emigrate
alone
perhaps
i
shall
conclude
to
accompany
you
when
the
time
comes
there
do
not
appear
to
be
room
in
this
country
for
dissenters
and
the
established
church
i
understand
there
is
in
new
england
i
may
conclude
to
try
it
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
we
shall
be
greatly
encouraged
if
you
decide
to
go
i
discussed
the
matter
with
benjamin
since
i
did
with
you
and
he
would
be
glad
to
go
if
his
business
and
family
did
not
fasten
him
here
i
think
he
would
rather
justify
your
going
did
he
say
so
no
not
in
so
many
words
but
he
did
say
that
he
would
go
if
his
circumstances
favored
it
as
much
as
your
circumstances
favor
your
going
well
that
is
more
than
i
supposed
he
would
say
i
expected
that
he
would
oppose
any
proposition
that
contemplated
my
removal
to
boston
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
am
inclined
to
go
the
franklins
clear
back
to
the
earliest
ancestors
had
experienced
much
persecution
some
of
them
could
keep
and
read
their
bible
only
by
concealing
it
and
reading
it
in
secret
the
following
from
autobiography
is
an
interesting
and
thrilling
incident
they
had
an
english
bible
and
to
conceal
it
and
place
it
in
safety
it
was
fastened
open
with
tapes
under
and
within
the
cover
of
a
when
my
wished
to
read
it
to
his
family
he
placed
the
on
his
knees
and
then
turned
over
the
leaves
under
the
tapes
one
of
the
children
stood
at
the
door
to
give
notice
if
he
saw
the
apparitor
coming
who
was
an
officer
of
the
spiritual
court
in
that
case
the
stool
was
turned
down
again
upon
its
feet
when
the
bible
remained
concealed
under
it
as
before
this
anecdote
i
had
from
uncle
benjamin
the
dissenters
from
the
established
church
loved
their
mode
of
worship
more
if
any
thing
than
members
of
their
mother
church
but
under
the
tyrannical
king
charles
ii
they
could
not
hold
public
meetings
at
the
time
to
which
we
refer
even
their
secret
meetings
were
often
disturbed
and
sometimes
broken
up
it
is
fully
settled
now
that
we
are
going
to
new
england
said
the
aforesaid
neighbor
to
josiah
franklin
subsequently
when
he
called
upon
him
with
two
other
neighbours
who
were
going
to
remove
with
him
and
we
have
called
to
persuade
you
to
go
with
us
we
do
not
see
how
we
can
take
no
for
an
answer
well
perhaps
i
shall
not
say
no
i
have
been
thinking
the
matter
over
and
i
have
talked
with
benjamin
and
my
wife
is
not
at
all
averse
to
going
but
i
ca
say
i
may
say
it
or
sometime
that
is
good
answered
one
of
the
neighbors
we
must
have
one
of
the
franklins
with
us
to
be
well
equipped
banbury
would
not
be
well
represented
in
boston
without
one
franklin
at
least
you
are
very
complimentary
replied
franklin
even
misery
loves
company
though
and
it
would
be
almost
carrying
home
with
us
for
several
families
to
emigrate
together
the
more
the
merrier
so
we
think
to
escape
from
the
intolerant
spirit
that
pursues
dissenters
here
will
make
us
merry
if
nothing
else
does
home
is
no
longer
home
when
we
can
worship
god
as
we
please
only
in
secret
there
is
much
truth
in
that
continued
franklin
i
am
much
more
inclined
to
remove
to
new
england
than
i
was
a
month
ago
the
more
i
reflect
upon
the
injustice
and
oppression
we
experience
the
less
i
think
of
this
country
for
a
home
indeed
i
have
mentally
concluded
to
go
if
i
can
arrange
my
affairs
as
i
hope
to
then
we
shall
be
content
we
shall
expect
to
have
you
one
of
the
company
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
meet
often
to
discuss
plans
and
methods
of
emigration
we
shall
not
find
it
to
be
a
small
matter
to
break
up
here
and
settle
there
it
was
settled
that
josiah
franklin
would
remove
to
new
england
with
his
neighbors
and
preparations
were
made
for
his
departure
with
them
these
facts
indicate
the
standing
and
influence
of
the
franklins
they
were
of
the
common
people
but
leading
families
their
intelligence
industry
and
christian
principle
entitled
them
to
public
confidence
and
respect
not
many
miles
away
from
them
were
the
washingtons
ancestors
of
george
washington
known
as
the
father
of
his
country
the
washingtons
were
more
aristocratic
than
the
franklins
and
possessed
more
of
the
world
wealth
and
honors
had
they
been
near
neighbors
they
would
not
have
associated
with
the
franklins
as
they
belonged
to
a
different
guild
such
were
the
customs
of
those
times
thomas
franklin
was
a
lawyer
and
became
a
considerable
man
in
the
county
was
chief
mover
of
all
enterprises
for
the
county
or
town
of
northampton
as
well
as
of
his
own
village
of
which
many
instances
were
related
of
him
and
he
was
much
taken
notice
of
and
patronized
by
lord
halifax
benjamin
was
very
ingenious
not
only
in
his
own
trade
as
dyer
but
in
all
other
matters
his
ingenuity
frequently
cropped
out
he
was
a
prolific
writer
of
poetry
and
when
he
died
he
left
behind
him
two
quarto
volumes
of
manuscript
of
his
own
poetry
consisting
of
fugitive
pieces
addressed
to
his
friends
an
early
ancestor
bearing
the
same
christian
name
was
imprisoned
for
a
whole
year
for
writing
a
piece
of
poetry
reflecting
upon
the
character
of
some
great
man
note
that
he
was
not
incarcerated
for
writing
bad
poetry
but
for
libelling
some
one
by
his
verse
though
he
might
have
been
very
properly
punished
for
writing
such
stuff
as
he
called
poetry
it
is
nothing
to
boast
of
that
his
descendant
uncle
benjamin
was
not
sent
to
prison
for
producing
two
quarto
volumes
of
his
own
poetry
as
the
reader
would
believe
if
compelled
to
read
it
franklin
said
in
his
autobiography
my
father
married
young
and
carried
his
wife
with
three
children
to
new
england
about
the
conventicles
meetings
of
dissenters
being
at
that
time
forbidden
by
law
and
frequently
disturbed
in
the
meetings
some
considerable
men
of
his
acquaintance
determined
to
go
to
that
country
and
he
was
prevailed
with
to
accompany
them
thither
where
they
expected
to
enjoy
their
religion
with
freedom
boston
was
not
then
what
it
is
now
and
no
one
living
expected
that
it
would
ever
become
a
city
of
great
size
and
importance
it
contained
less
than
six
thousand
inhabitants
the
bay
with
its
beautiful
islands
spread
out
in
front
where
bears
were
often
seen
swimming
across
it
or
from
one
island
to
another
on
long
wharf
was
a
pastime
to
many
and
twenty
were
killed
in
a
week
when
they
were
numerous
in
the
rear
of
the
town
stood
the
primeval
forests
where
red
men
and
wild
beasts
roamed
at
their
pleasure
it
is
claimed
that
an
indian
or
pioneer
might
have
traveled
at
that
time
through
unbroken
forests
from
boston
to
the
pacific
coast
a
distance
of
more
than
three
thousand
miles
except
here
and
there
where
western
prairies
stretched
out
like
an
ocean
of
land
as
lonely
and
desolate
as
the
forest
itself
that
in
two
hundred
years
and
less
sixty
millions
of
people
would
dwell
upon
this
vast
domain
in
cities
and
towns
of
surprising
wealth
and
beauty
was
not
even
thought
of
in
dreams
that
boston
would
ever
grow
into
a
city
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
with
commerce
trade
wealth
learning
and
influence
to
match
the
wildest
enthusiast
did
not
predict
a
single
fact
illustrates
the
prevailing
opinion
of
that
day
and
even
later
the
town
of
boston
appointed
a
commission
to
explore
the
country
along
charles
river
to
learn
what
prospects
there
were
for
settlers
the
commissioners
attended
to
their
duty
faithfully
and
reported
to
the
town
that
they
had
explored
ten
miles
west
as
far
as
settlers
would
ever
penetrate
the
forest
and
found
the
prospects
as
encouraging
as
could
be
expected
it
was
to
this
boston
that
josiah
franklin
emigrated
in
thinking
to
enjoy
liberty
of
conscience
while
he
supported
his
growing
family
by
his
trade
of
dyer
there
is
no
record
to
show
that
he
was
ever
sorry
he
came
on
the
other
hand
there
is
much
to
prove
that
he
always
had
occasion
to
rejoice
in
the
change
certainly
his
family
and
their
posterity
exerted
great
influence
in
building
up
the
nation
next
to
washington
josiah
son
benjamin
ranked
in
his
efforts
to
secure
american
independence
and
all
the
blessings
that
followed
ii
the
fifteenth
gift
the
fifteenth
remarked
josiah
franklin
to
a
relative
as
he
took
the
fifteenth
child
into
his
arms
and
a
son
too
he
must
bear
the
name
of
his
uncle
benjamin
then
we
are
to
understand
that
his
name
is
benjamin
answered
the
relative
inquiringly
yes
that
is
his
name
his
mother
and
i
settled
that
some
time
ago
that
the
next
son
should
bear
the
name
of
my
most
beloved
brother
who
i
hope
will
remove
to
this
country
before
long
well
a
baby
is
no
curiosity
in
your
family
remarked
the
relative
laughing
some
men
would
think
that
fifteen
was
too
much
of
a
good
thing
a
child
is
god
gift
to
man
as
i
view
it
for
which
parents
should
be
thankful
whether
it
is
the
first
or
fifteenth
each
child
imposes
an
additional
obligation
upon
parents
to
be
true
to
the
giver
as
well
as
to
the
gift
i
am
poor
enough
but
no
man
is
poorer
for
a
large
family
of
children
he
may
have
to
labor
harder
when
they
are
young
and
helpless
but
in
age
they
are
props
on
which
he
can
lean
franklin
spoke
out
of
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
was
a
true
christian
man
and
took
the
christian
view
of
a
child
as
he
did
of
any
thing
else
while
some
men
are
annoyed
by
the
multiplicity
of
children
he
found
a
source
of
comfort
and
contentment
in
the
possession
the
seventeenth
child
which
number
he
had
he
hailed
with
the
same
grateful
recognition
of
god
providence
that
he
did
when
the
first
was
born
yet
he
was
poor
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
poverty
most
of
the
time
each
child
born
was
born
to
an
inheritance
of
want
but
to
him
children
were
god
gift
as
really
as
sunshine
or
showers
day
or
night
the
seventeenth
just
as
much
so
as
the
first
this
fact
alone
marks
josiah
franklin
as
an
uncommon
man
for
his
day
or
ours
if
more
men
and
women
were
of
your
opinion
continued
the
relative
there
would
be
much
more
enjoyment
and
peace
in
all
communities
the
most
favorable
view
that
a
multitude
of
parents
indulge
is
that
children
are
troublesome
comforts
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
of
taking
this
baby
into
the
house
of
god
and
consecrating
him
to
the
lord
franklin
asked
as
if
the
thought
just
then
flashed
upon
his
mind
it
is
only
a
few
steps
to
carry
him
it
was
sunday
morning
old
style
and
the
old
south
meeting
house
in
which
samuel
willard
preached
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
scarcely
fifty
feet
distant
i
should
think
it
would
harmonize
very
well
with
your
opinion
about
children
as
the
gift
of
god
and
the
lord
may
understand
the
matter
so
well
as
to
look
approvingly
upon
it
but
i
think
your
neighbors
will
say
that
you
are
rushing
things
somewhat
it
might
be
well
to
let
the
little
fellow
get
used
to
this
world
before
he
begins
to
attend
meeting
the
relative
spoke
thus
in
a
vein
of
humor
though
she
really
did
not
approve
of
the
proposed
episode
in
the
new
comer
life
indeed
it
seemed
rather
ridiculous
to
her
to
carry
a
babe
a
few
hours
old
to
the
house
of
god
i
shall
not
consult
my
neighbors
franklin
replied
i
shall
consult
my
wife
in
this
matter
as
i
do
in
others
and
defer
to
her
opinion
i
have
always
found
that
her
judgment
is
sound
on
reducing
it
to
practice
that
is
so
your
wife
is
a
woman
of
sound
judgment
as
well
as
of
strong
character
and
you
are
wise
enough
to
recognize
the
fact
and
act
accordingly
but
that
is
not
true
of
many
men
if
your
wife
approves
of
taking
her
baby
into
the
for
consecration
then
do
it
though
the
whole
town
shall
denounce
the
act
there
is
no
doubt
his
relative
thought
that
franklin
would
veto
the
proposition
at
once
and
that
would
end
it
but
in
less
than
a
half
hour
he
reported
that
she
approved
of
the
proposition
benjamin
will
be
consecrated
to
the
lord
in
the
afternoon
my
wife
approves
of
it
as
proper
and
expressive
of
our
earnest
desire
that
he
should
be
the
lord
i
shall
see
willard
at
once
and
nothing
but
his
disapproval
will
hinder
the
act
and
i
would
not
hinder
it
if
i
could
replied
his
relative
if
your
wife
and
pastor
willard
approve
i
shall
really
be
in
favor
of
it
if
they
are
because
their
judgment
is
better
than
mine
all
the
difference
between
you
and
me
continued
franklin
with
a
smile
playing
over
his
face
appears
to
be
that
you
think
a
child
may
be
given
to
the
lord
too
soon
and
i
do
not
the
sooner
the
better
is
my
belief
with
the
consecration
come
additional
obligations
which
i
am
willing
to
assume
and
not
only
willing
but
anxious
to
assume
you
are
right
no
doubt
but
you
are
one
of
a
thousand
in
that
view
and
you
will
have
your
reward
yes
and
so
will
that
contemptible
class
of
fathers
who
can
endure
children
but
not
too
irresponsible
to
see
that
one
of
the
most
inconsistent
men
on
earth
is
the
father
who
will
not
accept
the
situation
he
has
created
for
himself
the
franklins
are
not
made
of
that
sort
of
stuff
neither
are
the
folgers
referring
to
his
wife
family
whose
fervent
piety
sanctifies
their
good
sense
so
that
they
would
rather
please
the
lord
than
all
mankind
willard
was
seen
and
he
endorsed
the
act
as
perfectly
proper
and
in
complete
harmony
with
a
felt
sense
of
parental
obligation
therefore
benjamin
was
wrapped
closely
in
flannel
blankets
and
carried
into
the
in
the
afternoon
where
he
was
consecrated
to
the
lord
by
the
pastor
on
the
old
boston
town
records
of
births
under
the
heading
boston
births
entered
is
this
benjamin
son
of
josiah
franklin
and
abiah
his
wife
born
jan
from
some
mistake
or
oversight
the
birth
was
not
recorded
until
two
years
after
benjamin
was
born
but
it
shows
that
he
was
born
on
then
the
records
of
the
old
south
church
among
the
baptism
of
infants
have
this
benjamin
son
of
josiah
and
abiah
franklin
putting
these
two
records
together
they
establish
beyond
doubt
the
fact
that
benjamin
franklin
was
born
and
baptized
on
the
same
day
the
old
south
church
had
two
pastors
then
and
it
is
supposed
that
samuel
willard
officiated
instead
of
rev
ebenezer
pemberton
because
the
record
is
in
the
handwriting
of
doctor
willard
we
are
able
to
furnish
a
picture
of
the
house
in
which
he
was
born
it
measured
twenty
feet
in
width
and
was
about
thirty
feet
long
including
the
it
was
three
stories
high
in
appearance
the
third
being
the
attic
on
the
lower
floor
of
the
main
house
there
was
only
one
room
which
was
about
twenty
feet
square
and
served
the
family
the
triple
purpose
of
parlor
and
it
contained
an
so
large
that
an
ox
might
have
been
roasted
before
it
the
second
and
third
stories
originally
contained
but
one
chamber
each
of
ample
dimensions
and
furnished
in
the
plainest
manner
the
attic
was
an
unplastered
room
which
might
have
been
used
for
lodgings
or
storing
trumpery
the
house
stood
about
one
hundred
years
after
josiah
franklin
left
it
and
was
finally
destroyed
by
fire
on
saturday
the
spot
on
which
it
stood
is
now
occupied
by
a
granite
warehouse
bearing
the
inscription
birthplace
of
benjamin
franklin
franklin
had
three
children
when
he
left
banbury
and
four
more
were
given
to
him
during
the
first
four
years
of
his
residence
in
boston
one
of
whom
died
soon
after
the
birth
of
the
seventh
child
franklin
died
so
young
and
large
a
family
needed
a
mother
watch
and
care
as
josiah
franklin
found
to
his
sorrow
the
additional
burden
laid
upon
him
by
the
death
of
his
wife
interfered
much
with
his
business
and
he
saw
fresh
reasons
each
day
for
finding
another
as
soon
as
possible
to
run
his
business
successfully
and
take
the
whole
charge
of
his
family
was
more
than
he
could
do
in
these
circumstances
he
felt
justified
in
marrying
again
as
soon
as
possible
and
with
the
aid
of
interested
friends
he
made
a
fortunate
choice
of
abiah
folger
of
nantucket
a
worthy
successor
of
the
first
franklin
he
married
her
a
few
months
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
the
second
franklin
became
the
mother
of
ten
children
which
added
to
those
of
the
first
franklin
constituted
a
very
respectable
family
of
seventeen
children
among
whom
was
benjamin
the
fifteenth
child
his
autobiography
says
of
the
seventeen
children
i
remember
to
have
seen
thirteen
sitting
together
at
the
table
who
all
grew
up
to
years
of
maturity
and
were
married
of
the
second
wife
it
says
my
mother
the
second
wife
of
my
father
was
abiah
folger
daughter
of
peter
folger
one
of
the
first
settlers
of
new
england
of
whom
honorable
mention
is
made
by
cotton
mather
in
his
ecclesiastical
history
of
that
country
a
godly
and
learned
englishman
josiah
franklin
was
an
admirer
not
only
of
his
wife
abiah
but
of
the
whole
folger
family
because
they
were
devoutly
pious
and
as
reliable
as
the
sun
or
the
earth
on
its
axis
they
were
unpolished
and
unceremonial
and
he
liked
them
all
the
more
for
that
he
wrote
to
his
sister
in
a
vein
of
pleasantry
they
are
wonderfully
shy
but
i
admire
their
honest
plainness
of
speech
about
a
year
ago
i
invited
two
of
them
to
dine
with
me
their
answer
was
that
they
would
if
they
could
not
do
better
i
suppose
they
did
better
for
i
never
saw
them
afterwards
and
so
had
no
opportunity
of
showing
my
miff
if
i
had
any
we
have
said
that
benjamin
was
named
for
his
uncle
in
england
and
possibly
some
of
the
other
children
were
named
for
other
relatives
in
the
mother
country
certainly
there
were
enough
of
them
to
go
round
any
usual
circle
of
relatives
taking
them
all
in
uncle
benjamin
was
very
much
pleased
with
the
honor
conferred
upon
him
and
he
always
manifested
great
interest
in
his
namesake
though
he
did
not
dream
that
he
would
one
day
represent
the
country
at
the
court
of
james
it
is
claimed
that
the
uncle
interest
in
his
namesake
brought
him
to
this
country
a
few
years
later
where
he
lived
and
died
be
that
as
it
may
he
ever
manifested
a
lively
interest
in
a
protege
and
evidently
regarded
him
as
an
uncommonly
bright
boy
who
would
some
day
score
a
creditable
mark
for
the
family
benjamin
was
more
than
a
comely
child
he
was
handsome
from
babyhood
to
manhood
he
was
so
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
strangers
his
eye
beamed
with
so
much
intelligence
as
to
almost
compel
the
thought
there
are
great
talents
behind
them
parton
says
it
is
probable
that
benjamin
franklin
derived
from
his
mother
the
fashion
of
his
body
and
the
cast
of
his
countenance
there
are
lineal
descendants
of
peter
folger
who
strikingly
resemble
franklin
in
these
particulars
one
of
whom
a
banker
in
new
orleans
looks
like
a
portrait
of
franklin
stepped
out
of
its
frame
josiah
franklin
did
not
enter
upon
the
trade
of
a
dyer
when
he
settled
in
boston
as
he
expected
the
new
country
was
very
different
from
the
old
in
its
fashions
and
wants
there
was
no
special
demand
for
a
dyer
if
people
could
earn
money
enough
to
cover
their
nakedness
they
cared
little
about
the
color
of
their
covering
one
color
was
just
as
good
as
another
to
keep
them
warm
or
to
preserve
their
decency
there
was
no
room
for
josiah
franklin
as
a
dyer
there
was
room
for
him
however
as
a
and
he
lost
no
time
in
taking
up
this
new
but
greasy
business
he
must
work
or
starve
and
of
the
two
he
preferred
work
though
the
occupation
might
not
be
neat
and
congenial
the
word
chandler
is
supposed
to
have
been
derived
from
the
french
so
that
a
tallow
was
a
sort
of
chandelier
in
society
at
that
early
day
he
furnished
light
which
was
more
necessary
than
color
to
almost
every
one
the
prevailing
method
of
lighting
dwellings
and
stores
was
with
tallow
candles
candles
and
whale
oil
were
the
two
known
articles
for
light
and
the
latter
was
expensive
so
that
the
former
was
generally
adopted
hence
josiah
franklin
business
was
honorable
because
it
was
necessary
and
by
it
with
great
industry
and
economy
he
was
able
to
keep
the
wolf
of
hunger
from
his
door
the
place
where
he
manufactured
candles
was
at
the
corner
of
hanover
and
union
streets
the
original
sign
that
he
selected
to
mark
his
place
of
business
was
a
blue
ball
half
as
large
as
a
man
head
hanging
over
the
door
bearing
the
name
josiah
franklin
and
the
date
the
same
ball
hangs
there
still
time
has
stolen
its
blue
but
not
the
name
and
date
into
this
building
also
he
removed
his
family
from
milk
street
soon
after
the
birth
of
benjamin
in
his
autobiography
franklin
says
my
elder
brothers
were
all
put
apprentices
to
different
trades
several
of
them
were
apprenticed
when
benjamin
was
born
john
worked
with
his
father
and
learned
the
trade
well
setting
up
the
business
for
himself
afterwards
in
providence
this
was
the
only
method
that
could
be
adopted
successfully
in
so
large
a
family
except
where
wealth
was
considerable
we
must
not
omit
the
fact
that
the
father
of
benjamin
was
a
good
singer
and
a
good
player
of
the
violin
after
the
labors
of
the
day
were
over
and
the
frugal
supper
eaten
and
the
table
cleared
and
the
room
put
in
order
for
the
evening
he
was
wont
to
sing
and
play
for
the
entertainment
of
his
family
he
was
sure
of
a
good
audience
every
night
if
his
performance
opened
before
the
younger
children
retired
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
custom
exerted
a
molding
influence
upon
the
household
although
the
music
might
have
been
like
uncle
benjamin
poetry
as
compared
with
the
music
of
our
day
for
the
reader
now
familiar
with
the
manners
customs
rush
of
business
inventions
wealth
and
fashion
of
our
day
it
is
difficult
to
understand
the
state
of
society
at
the
time
of
franklin
birth
parton
says
of
it
the
year
of

iii
paying
too
dear
for
the
whistle
when
benjamin
was
seven
years
old
he
had
not
been
to
school
a
day
yet
he
was
a
good
reader
and
speller
in
manhood
he
said
i
do
not
remember
when
i
could
not
read
so
it
must
have
been
very
early
he
was
one
of
those
irrepressible
little
fellows
whose
intuition
and
observation
are
better
than
school
he
learned
more
out
of
school
than
he
could
or
would
have
done
in
it
his
precocity
put
him
in
advance
of
most
boys
at
seven
even
without
schooling
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
have
to
testify
that
he
possessed
ten
talents
his
parents
knew
that
and
every
one
else
who
was
familiar
with
him
the
first
money
he
ever
had
to
spend
as
he
wished
was
on
a
holiday
when
he
was
seven
years
old
it
was
not
the
fourth
of
july
when
torpedoes
and
firecrackers
scare
horses
and
annoy
men
and
women
for
benjamin
holiday
was
more
than
sixty
years
before
the
declaration
of
independence
was
declared
and
that
is
what
we
celebrate
now
on
the
fourth
of
july
indeed
his
holiday
was
a
hundred
years
before
torpedoes
and
were
invented
it
was
a
however
in
which
the
whole
community
was
interested
including
the
youngest
boy
in
the
franklin
family
see
that
you
spend
your
money
well
remarked
his
mother
who
presented
him
with
several
coppers
and
keep
out
of
mischief
and
here
is
some
more
added
his
father
giving
him
several
coppers
to
add
to
his
spending
money
make
wise
investments
ben
for
your
reputation
depends
upon
it
and
the
latter
facetious
remark
was
made
in
a
way
that
indicated
his
love
for
the
boy
what
are
you
going
to
buy
ben
inquired
an
older
brother
who
wanted
to
draw
out
some
bright
answer
from
the
child
of
course
he
added
benjamin
made
no
reply
though
his
head
was
crammed
with
thoughts
about
his
first
holiday
i
shall
want
to
know
how
well
you
spend
your
money
ben
said
his
mother
remember
that
is
not
gold
that
glitters
you
got
all
the
money
you
can
have
all
the
older
members
of
the
family
were
interested
in
the
pastime
and
while
they
were
indulging
in
various
remarks
he
bounded
out
of
the
house
with
his
head
filled
with
bewitching
fancies
evidently
expecting
such
a
day
of
joy
as
he
never
knew
before
perhaps
the
was
first
in
his
mind
into
which
he
had
looked
wistfully
many
times
as
he
passed
and
perhaps
it
was
not
we
say
though
it
was
not
such
a
as
boston
has
where
thousands
of
toys
of
every
description
and
price
are
offered
for
sale
but
it
was
a
store
in
which
with
other
articles
toys
were
kept
for
sale
very
few
in
number
and
variety
compared
with
the
toys
offered
for
sale
at
the
present
day
benjamin
had
seen
these
in
the
window
often
and
no
doubt
had
wished
to
possess
some
of
them
but
there
were
no
toys
in
the
franklin
family
there
were
children
instead
of
toys
so
many
of
them
that
money
to
pay
for
playthings
was
out
of
the
question
benjamin
had
not
proceeded
far
on
the
street
when
he
met
a
boy
blowing
a
whistle
that
he
had
just
purchased
the
sound
of
the
whistle
and
the
boy
evident
delight
in
blowing
it
captivated
benjamin
at
once
he
stopped
to
listen
and
measure
the
possessor
of
that
musical
wonder
he
said
nothing
but
just
listened
not
only
with
his
ears
but
with
his
whole
self
he
was
delighted
with
the
concert
that
one
small
boy
could
make
and
then
and
there
he
resolved
to
go
into
that
concert
business
himself
so
he
pushed
on
without
having
said
a
word
to
the
owner
of
the
whistle
fully
persuaded
to
invest
his
money
in
the
same
sort
of
a
musical
instrument
supposing
that
the
whistle
was
bought
at
the
store
where
he
had
seen
toys
in
the
window
he
took
a
bee
line
for
it
any
whistles
he
inquired
almost
out
of
breath
plenty
of
them
my
little
man
the
proprietor
answered
with
a
smile
at
the
same
time
proceeding
to
lay
before
the
small
customer
quite
a
number
i
will
give
you
all
the
money
i
have
for
one
said
benjamin
without
inquiring
the
price
he
was
so
zealous
to
possess
a
whistle
that
the
price
was
of
no
account
provided
he
had
enough
money
to
pay
for
it
ah
all
you
have
responded
the
merchant
perhaps
you
have
not
as
much
as
i
ask
for
them
they
are
very
nice
whistles
yes
i
know
they
are
and
i
will
give
you
all
the
money
i
have
for
one
of
them
was
benjamin
frank
response
the
fact
was
he
began
to
think
that
he
had
not
sufficient
money
to
purchase
one
so
valuable
did
a
whistle
appear
to
him
at
that
juncture
how
much
money
have
you
inquired
the
merchant
benjamin
told
him
honestly
how
many
coppers
he
had
which
was
more
than
the
actual
price
of
the
whistles
the
merchant
replied
yes
you
may
have
a
whistle
for
that
take
your
pick
never
was
a
child
more
delighted
than
he
when
the
bargain
was
closed
he
tried
every
whistle
that
he
might
select
the
loudest
one
of
all
and
when
his
choice
was
settled
he
exchanged
his
entire
wealth
for
the
prize
he
was
as
well
satisfied
as
the
merchant
when
he
left
the
store
ignorance
is
bliss
it
is
said
and
it
was
to
benjamin
for
a
brief
space
he
began
his
concert
as
soon
as
he
left
the
store
he
wanted
nothing
more
he
had
seen
all
he
wanted
to
see
he
had
bought
all
he
wanted
to
buy
the
whole
holiday
was
crowded
into
that
whistle
to
him
that
was
all
there
was
of
it
sweetmeats
and
had
no
attractions
for
him
military
parade
had
no
charm
for
him
for
he
could
parade
himself
now
a
band
of
music
had
lost
its
charm
now
that
he
had
turned
himself
into
a
band
at
once
he
started
for
home
instead
of
looking
after
other
sights
and
scenes
he
had
been
absent
scarcely
half
an
hour
when
he
reappeared
blowing
his
whistle
lustily
as
he
entered
the
house
as
if
he
expected
to
astonish
the
whole
race
of
franklins
by
the
shrillness
if
not
by
the
sweetness
of
his
music
back
so
quick
exclaimed
his
mother
yes
seen
all
i
want
to
see
that
was
a
truth
well
spoken
for
the
whistle
just
commanded
his
whole
being
and
there
was
room
for
nothing
more
a
whistle
was
all
the
holiday
he
wanted
what
have
you
there
ben
continued
his
mother
something
to
make
us
crazy
a
whistle
mother
stopping
its
noise
just
long
enough
for
a
decent
reply
and
then
continuing
the
concert
as
before
how
much
did
you
give
for
the
whistle
asked
his
older
brother
john
all
the
money
i
had
benjamin
was
too
much
elated
with
his
bargain
to
conceal
any
thing
what
exclaimed
john
with
surprise
did
you
give
all
your
money
for
that
little
concern
yes
every
cent
of
it
you
are
not
half
so
bright
as
i
thought
you
were
it
is
four
times
as
much
as
the
whistle
is
worth
did
you
ask
the
price
of
it
inquired
his
mother
no
i
told
the
man
i
would
give
him
all
the
money
i
had
for
one
and
he
took
it
of
course
he
did
interjected
john
and
if
you
had
had
four
times
as
much
he
would
have
taken
it
for
the
whistle
you
are
a
poor
trader
ben
you
should
have
asked
the
price
of
it
in
the
first
place
remarked
his
mother
to
him
and
then
if
there
was
not
enough
you
could
have
offered
all
the
money
you
had
for
the
whistle
that
would
have
been
proper
if
you
had
paid
a
reasonable
price
for
it
continued
john
you
might
had
enough
money
left
to
have
bought
a
pocket
full
of
good
things
yes
peppermints
candy
cakes
nuts
and
perhaps
more
added
a
cousin
who
was
present
desiring
most
of
all
to
hear
what
the
bright
boy
would
say
for
himself
i
must
say
that
you
are
a
smart
fellow
ben
to
be
taken
in
like
that
continued
john
who
really
wanted
to
make
his
brother
feel
bad
and
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
derision
all
your
money
for
that
worthless
thing
that
is
enough
to
make
us
crazy
you
ought
to
have
known
better
if
you
had
five
dollars
i
suppose
that
you
would
have
given
it
just
as
quick
for
the
whistle
of
course
he
would
the
whistle
was
worth
that
to
him
and
he
bought
it
for
himself
not
for
any
one
else
by
this
time
benjamin
who
had
said
nothing
in
reply
to
their
taunts
and
reproofs
was
running
over
with
feeling
and
he
could
hold
in
no
longer
evidently
he
saw
his
mistake
and
he
burst
into
tears
and
made
more
noise
by
crying
than
he
did
with
his
whistle
their
ridicule
and
the
thought
of
having
paid
more
than
he
should
for
the
whistle
overcame
him
and
he
found
relief
in
tears
his
father
came
to
his
rescue
never
mind
ben
you
will
understand
how
to
trade
the
next
time
we
have
to
live
and
learn
i
have
paid
too
much
for
a
whistle
more
than
once
in
my
life
you
did
as
well
as
other
boys
do
the
first
time
i
think
so
too
ben
joined
in
his
mother
to
comfort
him
john
is
only
teasing
you
and
trying
to
get
some
sport
out
of
his
holiday
better
wipe
up
and
go
out
in
the
street
to
see
the
sights
benjamin
learned
a
good
lesson
from
this
episode
of
his
early
life
he
only
did
what
many
boys
have
done
over
and
over
again
pay
too
much
for
a
whistle
men
of
forty
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age
do
this
same
thing
and
suffer
the
consequences
it
is
one
of
the
common
mistakes
of
life
and
becomes
a
benefit
when
the
lesson
it
teaches
is
improved
as
franklin
improved
it
in
the
year
november
franklin
wrote
from
passy
france
to
a
friend
as
follows
i
am
charmed
with
your
description
of
paradise
and
with
your
plan
of
living
there
and
i
approve
much
of
your
conclusion
that
in
the
mean
time
we
should
draw
all
the
good
we
can
from
this
world
in
my
opinion
we
might
all
draw
more
good
from
it
than
we
do
and
suffer
less
evil
if
we
would
take
care
not
to
give
too
much
for
for
to
me
it
seems
that
most
of
the
unhappy
people
we
meet
with
are
become
so
by
neglect
of
that
caution
you
ask
what
i
mean
you
love
stories
and
will
excuse
my
telling
one
of
myself
when
i
was
a
child
of
seven
years
old
my
friends
on
a
holiday
filled
my
pocket
with
coppers
i
went
directly
to
a
shop
where
they
sold
toys
for
children
and
being
charmed
with
the
sound
of
a
that
i
met
by
the
way
in
the
hands
of
another
boy
i
voluntarily
offered
and
gave
all
my
money
for
one
i
then
came
home
and
went
whistling
all
over
the
house
much
pleased
with
my
but
disturbing
all
the
family
my
brothers
sisters
and
cousins
understanding
the
bargain
i
had
made
told
me
i
had
given
four
times
as
much
for
it
as
it
was
worth
put
me
in
mind
what
good
things
i
might
have
bought
with
the
rest
of
the
money
and
laughed
at
me
so
much
for
my
folly
that
i
cried
with
vexation
and
the
reflection
gave
me
more
chagrin
than
the
gave
me
pleasure
this
however
was
afterwards
of
use
to
me
the
impression
continuing
on
my
mind
so
that
often
when
i
was
tempted
to
buy
some
unnecessary
thing
i
said
to
myself
give
too
much
for
the
and
i
saved
my
money
as
i
grew
up
came
into
the
world
and
observed
the
actions
of
men
i
thought
i
met
with
many
very
many
gave
too
much
for
the
when
i
saw
one
too
ambitious
of
court
favor
sacrificing
his
time
in
attendance
on
levees
his
repose
his
liberty
his
virtue
and
perhaps
his
friends
to
attain
it
i
have
said
to
myself
man
gives
too
much
for
his
when
i
saw
another
fond
of
popularity
constantly
employing
himself
in
political
bustles
neglecting
his
own
affairs
and
ruining
them
by
that
neglect
pays
said
i
much
for
his
if
i
knew
a
miser
who
gave
up
every
kind
of
comfortable
living
all
the
pleasure
of
doing
good
to
others
all
the
esteem
of
his
and
the
joys
of
benevolent
friendship
for
the
sake
of
accumulating
wealth
said
i
pay
too
much
for
your
when
i
met
with
a
man
of
pleasure
sacrificing
every
laudable
improvement
of
the
mind
or
his
fortune
to
mere
corporeal
sensations
and
ruining
his
health
in
their
pursuit
said
i
are
providing
pain
for
yourself
instead
of
pleasure
you
give
too
much
for
your
if
i
see
one
fond
of
appearance
or
fine
clothes
fine
houses
fine
furniture
fine
equipages
all
above
his
fortune
for
which
he
contracts
debts
and
ends
his
career
in
a
prison
say
i
has
paid
dear
very
dear
for
his
when
i
see
a
beautiful
girl
married
to
an
brute
of
a
husband
a
say
i
she
should
pay
so
much
for
a
in
short
i
conceive
that
great
part
of
the
miseries
of
mankind
are
brought
upon
them
by
the
false
estimates
they
have
made
of
the
value
of
things
and
by
their
too
much
for
their
yet
i
ought
to
have
charity
for
these
unhappy
people
when
i
consider
that
with
all
this
wisdom
of
which
i
am
boasting
there
are
certain
things
in
the
world
so
tempting
for
example
the
apples
of
king
john
which
happily
are
not
to
be
bought
for
if
they
were
put
to
sale
by
auction
i
might
very
easily
be
led
to
ruin
myself
in
the
purchase
and
find
that
i
had
once
more
given
too
much
for
the
thus
benjamin
made
good
use
of
one
of
the
foolish
acts
of
his
boyhood
which
tells
well
both
for
his
head
and
heart
many
boys
are
far
less
wise
and
do
the
same
foolish
thing
over
and
over
again
they
never
learn
wisdom
from
the
past
when
a
boy
equivocates
or
deceives
to
conceal
some
act
of
disobedience
from
his
parents
or
teachers
and
thereby
lays
the
foundation
of
habitual
untruthfulness
he
pays
too
dear
for
the
whistle
and
he
will
learn
the
truth
of
it
when
he
becomes
older
and
can
not
command
the
confidence
of
his
friends
and
neighbors
but
is
branded
by
them
as
an
unreliable
dishonest
man
in
like
manner
the
boy
who
thinks
it
is
manly
to
smoke
and
drink
beer
will
find
that
he
has
a
very
expensive
whistle
when
he
becomes
a
hale
fellow
well
met
among
a
miserable
class
of
young
men
and
is
discarded
by
the
virtuous
and
good
so
in
general
the
young
person
who
is
fascinated
by
mere
pleasure
and
supposes
that
wealth
and
honor
are
real
apples
of
gold
to
the
possessor
thinking
less
of
a
good
character
than
he
does
of
show
and
glitter
will
find
that
he
has
been
blowing
a
costly
whistle
when
it
is
too
late
to
recall
his
mistake
iv
in
school
uncle
benjamin
was
so
deeply
interested
in
his
namesake
that
he
wrote
many
letters
about
him
nearly
every
ship
that
sailed
for
boston
brought
a
letter
from
him
to
the
franklin
family
and
almost
every
letter
contained
a
piece
of
poetry
from
his
pen
one
of
his
letters
about
that
time
contained
the
following
acrostic
on
benjamin
name
be
to
thy
parents
an
obedient
son
each
day
let
duty
constantly
be
done

give

to
sloth
or

or
pride
if
free
you
be
from
thousand
ills

all

the
shelf

and

in

make
shrink
at
suffering
for
thy
savior
sake
fraud
and
all
falsehood
in
thy
dealings
flee

adore
the
maker
of
thy
inward

now
the

and
witness
this
thy
acts
attend
in
heart
with
bended
knee
alone
adore
none
but
the
three
in
one
for
evermore
the
sentiment
is
better
than
the
poetry
and
it
shows
that
the
hero
of
our
tale
had
a
treasure
in
the
uncle
for
whom
he
was
named
doubtless
uncle
benjamin
interest
was
largely
increased
by
the
loss
of
his
own
children
he
had
quite
a
number
of
sons
and
daughters
and
one
after
another
of
them
sickened
and
died
until
only
one
son
remained
and
he
removed
to
boston
it
was
for
these
reasons
probably
that
uncle
benjamin
came
to
this
country
in
among
his
letters
was
one
to
his
brother
josiah
our
benjamin
father
when
the
son
was
seven
years
old
from
which
we
extract
the
following
a
father
with
so
large
a
family
as
yours
ought
to
give
one
son
at
least
to
the
service
of
the
church
that
is
your
tithe
from
what
you
write
about
benjamin
i
should
say
that
he
is
the
son
you
ought
to
consecrate
specially
to
the
work
of
the
ministry
he
must
possess
talents
of
a
high
order
and
his
love
of
learning
must
develop
them
rapidly
if
he
has
made
himself
a
good
reader
and
speller
as
you
say
without
teachers
there
is
no
telling
what
he
will
do
with
them
by
all
means
if
possible
i
should
devote
him
to
the
church
it
will
be
a
heavy
tax
upon
you
of
course
with
so
large
a
family
on
your
hands
but
your
reward
will
come
when
you
are
old
and
would
that
i
were
in
circumstances
to
assist
you
in
educating
him
he
does
not
know
how
much
thought
and
planning
we
have
given
to
this
subject
remarked
franklin
to
his
wife
when
he
read
this
part
of
the
letter
i
would
do
any
thing
possible
to
educate
benjamin
for
the
church
and
i
think
he
would
make
the
most
of
any
opportunities
we
can
give
him
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
responded
franklin
few
parents
ever
had
more
encouragement
to
educate
a
son
for
the
ministry
than
we
have
to
educate
him
doctor
willard
said
as
much
as
that
to
me
added
franklin
and
i
think
it
is
true
i
do
not
despair
of
giving
benjamin
an
education
yet
though
i
scarcely
see
how
it
ever
can
be
done
that
is
the
way
i
feel
about
it
responded
franklin
perhaps
god
will
provide
a
way
somehow
i
trust
in
providence
and
wait
hoping
for
the
best
it
is
well
to
trust
in
providence
if
it
is
not
done
blindly
remarked
franklin
providence
sometimes
does
wonders
for
people
who
trust
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
who
parted
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
for
the
children
of
israel
to
pass
and
fed
them
with
manna
from
the
skies
can
provide
a
way
for
our
benjamin
to
be
educated
but
it
looks
to
me
as
if
some
of
his
bread
would
have
to
drop
down
from
heaven
well
if
it
drops
that
is
enough
replied
franklin
i
shall
be
satisfied
if
god
does
any
thing
for
him
he
will
do
it
in
his
own
time
and
way
and
i
shall
be
content
with
that
to
see
him
in
the
service
of
the
church
is
the
most
i
want
uncle
benjamin
letter
did
not
introduce
a
new
subject
of
conversation
into
the
franklin
family
it
was
already
an
old
theme
that
had
been
much
canvassed
outside
of
the
family
there
was
an
interest
in
benjamin
education
he
was
the
kind
of
a
boy
to
put
through
harvard
college
this
was
the
opinion
of
neighbors
who
knew
him
nothing
but
poverty
hindered
the
adoption
and
execution
of
that
plan
uncle
benjamin
letter
did
this
however
it
hastened
a
favorable
decision
though
benjamin
was
eight
years
old
when
his
parents
decided
that
he
might
enter
upon
a
course
of
education
they
had
said
very
little
to
their
son
about
it
because
they
would
not
awaken
his
expectations
to
disappoint
them
and
finally
the
decision
was
reached
with
several
ifs
added
i
do
not
know
how
i
shall
come
out
added
franklin
he
may
begin
to
study
it
wo
hurt
him
to
begin
if
i
should
not
be
able
to
put
him
through
a
course
the
decision
to
send
him
to
school
was
arrived
at
in
this
doubtful
way
and
it
was
not
laid
more
strongly
than
this
before
benjamin
for
fear
of
awakening
too
high
hopes
in
his
heart
i
have
decided
to
send
you
to
school
said
his
father
to
him
but
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
send
you
as
long
as
i
would
like
is
not
certain
yet
i
would
like
to
educate
you
for
the
ministry
if
i
could
how
would
you
like
that
i
should
like
to
go
to
school
i
should
like
nothing
better
answered
benjamin
about
the
rest
of
it
i
do
not
know
whether
i
should
like
it
or
not
well
it
may
not
be
best
to
discuss
that
continued
his
father
as
i
may
not
be
able
to
carry
out
my
plan
to
the
end
it
will
cost
a
good
deal
to
keep
you
in
school
and
educate
you
perhaps
more
than
i
can
possibly
raise
with
so
large
a
family
to
support
i
have
to
be
very
industrious
now
to
pay
all
my
bills
but
if
you
are
diligent
to
improve
your
time
and
lend
a
helping
hand
at
home
out
of
school
hours
i
may
be
able
to
do
it
i
will
work
all
i
can
out
of
school
if
i
can
only
go
was
benjamin
cheerful
pledge
in
the
outset
when
shall
i
begin
begin
the
next
term
it
is
a
long
process
to
become
educated
for
the
ministry
and
the
sooner
you
begin
the
better
but
you
must
understand
that
it
is
not
certain
i
can
continue
you
in
school
for
a
long
time
make
the
most
of
the
advantages
you
have
and
we
will
trust
in
providence
for
the
future
josiah
franklin
caution
was
proverbial
he
was
never
rash
or
thoughtless
he
weighed
all
questions
carefully
he
was
very
conscientious
and
would
not
assume
an
obligation
that
he
could
not
see
his
way
clear
to
meet
he
used
the
same
careful
judgment
and
circumspection
about
the
education
of
his
son
that
he
employed
in
all
business
matters
for
this
reason
he
was
regarded
as
a
man
of
sound
judgment
and
practical
wisdom
and
his
influence
was
strong
and
wide
when
his
son
reached
the
height
of
his
fame
he
wrote
as
follows
of
his
father
i
suppose
you
may
like
to
know
what
kind
of
a
man
my
father
was
he
had
an
excellent
constitution
was
of
a
middle
stature
well
set
and
very
strong
he
could
draw
prettily
and
was
skilled
a
little
in
music
his
voice
was
sonorous
and
agreeable
so
that
when
he
played
on
his
violin
and
sung
withal
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
after
the
business
of
the
day
was
over
it
was
extremely
agreeable
to
hear
he
had
some
knowledge
of
mechanics
and
on
occasion
was
handy
with
other
tools
but
his
great
excellence
was
his
sound
understanding
and
his
solid
judgment
in
prudential
matters
both
in
private
and
public
affairs
it
is
true
he
was
never
employed
in
the
latter
the
numerous
family
he
had
to
educate
and
the
straitness
of
his
circumstances
keeping
him
close
to
his
trade
but
i
remember
well
his
being
frequently
visited
by
leading
men
who
consulted
him
for
his
opinion
in
public
affairs
and
those
of
the
church
he
belonged
to
and
who
showed
a
great
respect
for
his
judgment
and
advice
he
was
also
consulted
much
by
private
persons
about
their
affairs
when
any
difficulty
occurred
and
frequently
chosen
an
arbitrator
between
contending
parties
of
his
mother
he
wrote
at
the
same
time
my
mother
had
likewise
an
excellent
constitution
she
suckled
all
her
ten
children
i
never
knew
either
my
father
or
mother
to
have
any
sickness
but
that
of
which
they
died
he
at
and
she
at
years
of
age
they
lie
buried
together
at
boston
where
i
some
years
since
placed
a
marble
over
their
grave
with
this
inscription
josiah
franklin
and
abiah
his
wife
lie
here
interred
they
lived
lovingly
together
in
wedlock
years
and
without
an
estate
or
any
gainful
employment
by
constant
labor
and
honest
industry
with
god
blessing
maintained
a
large
family
comfortably
and
brought
up
thirteen
children
and
seven
grandchildren
reputably
from
this
instance
reader
be
encouraged
to
diligence
in
thy
calling
and
distrust

he
was
a
pious
and
prudent

discreet
and
virtuous
woman
their
youngest
son
in
filial
regard

their
memory
places
this
stone
born
died
aet
born
died
aet
we
may
say
here
that
the
stone
which
doctor
franklin
erected
as
above
became
so
dilapidated
that
in
the
citizens
of
boston
replaced
it
by
a
granite
obelisk
the
bodies
repose
in
the
old
granary
cemetery
beside
church
it
was
arranged
that
benjamin
should
begin
his
and
enjoy
the
best
literary
advantages
which
the
poverty
of
his
father
could
provide
he
acceded
to
the
plan
with
hearty
and
commenced
his
studies
with
such
zeal
and
enthusiasm
as
few
scholars
exhibit
the
school
was
taught
by
nathaniel
williams
successor
of
the
famous
boston
teacher
ezekiel
cheever
who
was
instructor
years
and
who
discontinued
teaching
as
cotton
mather
said
only
when
mortality
took
him
off
the
homely
old
wooden
one
story
and
a
half
high
stood
near
by
the
spot
on
which
the
bronze
statue
of
franklin
is
now
seen
and
there
was
the
green
where
ben
and
his
companions
played
together
probably
it
was
the
only
free
grammar
school
that
boston
afforded
at
that
time
for
the
town
could
not
have
numbered
a
population
of
over
eight
thousand
from
his
first
day
attendance
at
school
benjamin
gave
promise
of
high
scholarship
he
went
to
work
with
a
will
improving
every
moment
surmounting
every
difficulty
and
enjoying
every
opportunity
with
a
keen
relish
williams
was
both
gratified
and
surprised
that
a
lad
so
young
should
take
hold
of
school
lessons
with
so
much
intelligence
and
tact
and
master
them
so
easily
was
a
surprise
to
him
and
he
so
expressed
himself
to
franklin
your
son
is
a
remarkable
scholar
for
one
so
young
i
am
more
than
gratified
with
his
industry
and
progress
his
love
of
knowledge
is
almost
passionate
yes
he
was
always
so
responded
franklin
he
surprised
us
by
reading
well
before
we
ever
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
he
taught
himself
and
a
book
has
always
been
of
more
value
to
him
than
any
thing
else
you
will
give
him
an
education
i
suppose
said
williams
inquiringly
such
a
boy
ought
to
have
the
chance
my
desire
to
do
it
is
strong
much
stronger
than
my
ability
to
pay
the
bills
it
is
not
certain
that
i
shall
be
able
to
continue
him
long
at
school
though
i
shall
do
it
if
possible
such
love
of
knowledge
as
he
possesses
ought
to
be
gratified
continued
williams
he
excels
by
far
any
scholar
of
his
age
in
school
he
will
lead
the
whole
school
within
a
short
time
his
enthusiasm
is
really
remarkable
within
a
few
months
as
the
teacher
predicts
benjamin
led
the
school
he
was
at
the
head
of
his
class
in
every
study
except
arithmetic
nor
did
he
remain
at
the
head
of
his
class
long
for
he
was
rapidly
promoted
to
higher
classes
he
so
far
outstripped
his
companions
that
the
teacher
was
obliged
to
advance
him
thus
that
his
mental
progress
might
not
be
retarded
of
course
teachers
and
others
were
constantly
forecasting
his
future
and
prophesying
that
he
would
fill
a
high
position
in
manhood
it
is
generally
the
case
that
such
early
attention
to
studies
in
connection
with
the
advancement
that
follows
awakens
high
hopes
of
the
young
in
the
hearts
of
all
observers
these
things
foreshadow
the
future
character
so
that
people
think
they
can
tell
what
the
man
will
be
from
what
the
boy
is
so
it
was
with
franklin
and
so
it
was
with
daniel
webster
webster
mother
inferred
from
his
close
attention
to
reading
and
his
remarkable
progress
in
learning
that
he
would
become
a
distinguished
man
and
so
expressed
herself
to
others
she
lived
to
see
him
rise
in
his
profession
until
he
became
a
member
of
congress
though
she
died
before
he
reached
the
zenith
of
his
renown
the
same
was
true
of
david
rittenhouse
the
famous
mathematician
when
he
was
but
eight
years
old
he
constructed
various
articles
such
as
a
miniature
and
at
seventeen
years
of
age
he
made
a
complete
clock
his
younger
brother
declared
that
he
was
accustomed
to
stop
when
he
was
plowing
in
the
field
and
solve
problems
on
the
fence
and
sometimes
cover
the
plow
handles
with
figures
the
highest
expectations
of
his
friends
were
more
than
realized
in
his
manhood
the
peculiar
genius
which
he
exhibited
in
his
boyhood
gave
him
his
fame
at
last
also
george
stephenson
the
great
engineer
the
son
of
a
very
poor
man
who
fired
the
engine
at
wylam
colliery
began
his
when
a
mere
boy
besides
watching
the
cows
and
barring
the
gates
after
the
had
passed
at
four
cents
a
day
he
amused
himself
during
his
leisure
moments
in
making
clay
engines
in
imitation
of
that
which
his
father
tended
although
he
lived
in
circumstances
so
humble
that
ordinarily
he
would
have
been
entirely
unnoticed
his
intense
interest
in
and
taste
for
mechanical
work
attracted
the
attention
of
people
and
led
them
to
predict
his
future
success
and
fame
in
like
manner
the
first
months
of
benjamin
franklin
school
days
foreshadowed
the
remarkable
career
of
his
manhood
relatives
and
friends
believed
that
he
would
one
day
fill
a
high
place
in
the
land
and
in
that
their
anticipations
were
fully
realized
out
of
school
franklin
finances
did
not
improve
it
was
clearer
every
day
to
him
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
keep
benjamin
in
school
besides
in
a
few
months
john
who
had
learned
the
business
of
his
father
was
going
to
be
married
and
establish
himself
in
that
trade
in
providence
some
body
must
take
his
place
it
was
quite
impossible
for
his
father
to
prosecute
his
business
alone
i
see
no
other
way
remarked
franklin
to
his
wife
i
shall
be
obliged
to
take
benjamin
out
of
school
to
help
me
my
expenses
increase
from
month
to
month
and
must
continue
to
increase
for
some
years
so
far
as
i
can
see
they
will
increase
heavily
if
i
am
obliged
to
hire
a
man
in
john
place
i
am
not
surprised
at
all
that
you
have
come
to
that
conclusion
replied
franklin
i
expected
it
as
i
have
intimated
to
you
parents
must
be
better
off
than
we
are
to
be
able
to
send
a
son
to
college
if
they
have
as
many
children
to
support
as
we
have
you
might
add
i
could
easily
accomplish
it
with
no
larger
family
than
most
of
my
neighbors
have
yet
i
find
no
fault
with
the
number
i
accept
all
the
lord
sends
i
am
sorry
for
benjamin
continued
franklin
he
will
be
dreadfully
disappointed
i
am
afraid
that
he
will
think
little
of
work
because
he
thinks
so
much
of
his
school
what
a
pity
that
boys
who
want
an
education
as
he
does
could
not
have
it
and
boys
who
do
not
want
it
should
do
the
work
that
is
the
way
we
should
fix
it
no
doubt
if
the
ordering
were
left
to
us
said
franklin
but
i
never
did
have
my
own
way
and
i
never
expect
to
have
it
and
it
is
fortunate
i
suppose
that
i
never
did
have
it
if
i
could
have
it
now
i
should
send
benjamin
to
college
it
has
been
my
prayer
that
he
might
give
his
life
and
his
services
to
the
church
added
franklin
but
providence
appears
to
indicate
now
that
he
should
make
candles
for
a
livelihood
and
it
is
not
in
me
to
rebel
against
the
ordering
if
frustrated
in
this
plan
i
mean
to
believe
that
providence
has
some
thing
better
in
store
for
him
and
us
i
was
never
so
reluctant
to
adopt
a
conclusion
as
i
have
been
to
take
benjamin
out
of
school
continued
franklin
yet
there
has
been
one
thought
that
reconciled
me
in
part
to
the
necessity
and
that
is
that
there
is
less
encouragement
to
a
young
man
in
the
church
now
than
formerly
it
is
more
difficult
to
suit
the
people
and
consequently
there
are
more
trials
and
hardships
for
ministers
and
many
of
them
appear
to
be
peculiar
if
ministers
have
a
harder
time
than
you
do
i
pity
them
rejoined
franklin
i
suppose
as
that
is
concerned
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
if
we
meet
them
with
christian
fortitude
as
we
should
so
much
the
better
for
us
true
very
true
and
my
uppermost
desire
is
to
put
benjamin
where
duty
points
but
it
is
clear
to
me
now
that
providence
has
blocked
his
way
to
the
ministry
you
will
not
take
him
out
of
school
until
john
leaves
will
you
inquired
franklin
i
shall
have
him
leave
the
public
school
at
the
close
of
this
term
and
that
will
give
him
a
full
year
schooling
and
then
i
shall
put
him
into
brownwell
school
for
a
while
to
improve
him
in
penmanship
and
arithmetic
by
that
time
i
must
have
him
in
the
factory
brownwell
had
a
private
school
in
which
he
taught
penmanship
and
arithmetic
it
was
quite
a
famous
school
made
so
by
his
success
as
a
teacher
in
these
departments
benjamin
had
received
no
intimation
at
this
time
that
he
would
be
taken
out
of
school
his
father
shrunk
from
disclosing
his
final
plan
to
him
because
he
knew
it
would
be
so
disappointing
but
as
the
close
of
the
school
year
drew
near
he
was
obliged
to
open
the
subject
to
him
it
was
an
unpleasant
revelation
to
benjamin
although
it
was
not
altogether
unexpected
for
in
the
outset
his
father
had
said
that
such
might
be
the
necessity
you
are
a
poor
penman
and
deficient
in
your
knowledge
of
numbers
said
his
father
and
improvement
in
these
branches
will
be
of
great
service
to
you
in
my
business
you
will
attend
brownwell
school
for
a
while
in
order
to
perfect
yourself
in
these
studies
i
shall
like
that
answered
benjamin
but
why
can
i
not
attend
school
until
i
am
old
enough
to
help
you
you
are
old
enough
to
help
me
there
are
many
things
you
can
do
as
well
as
a
man
i
should
like
to
know
what
said
benjamin
rather
surprised
that
he
could
be
of
any
service
in
the
candle
business
at
nine
years
of
age
john
had
to
learn
the
trade
before
he
could
help
you
much
you
can
cut
the
wicks
fill
the
moulds
for
keep
the
shop
in
order
run
hither
and
thither
with
errands
and
do
other
things
that
will
save
my
time
and
thus
assist
me
just
as
much
as
a
man
could
in
doing
the
same
things
i
am
sure
that
is
inducement
enough
for
any
boy
but
a
lazy
one
to
work
remarked
his
mother
who
had
listened
to
the
conversation
your
father
would
have
to
pay
high
wages
to
a
man
to
do
what
you
can
do
as
well
if
i
understand
it
in
doing
errands
you
will
aid
as
much
even
perhaps
more
than
in
doing
any
thing
else
added
franklin
i
have
a
good
deal
of
such
running
to
do
and
if
you
do
it
i
can
be
employed
in
the
more
important
part
of
my
business
which
no
one
else
can
attend
to
besides
your
nimble
feet
can
get
over
the
ground
much
quicker
than
my
older
and
clumsier
ones
so
that
you
can
perform
that
part
of
the
business
better
than
i
can
myself
this
was
a
new
view
of
the
case
to
benjamin
and
he
was
more
favorably
impressed
with
by
these
remarks
he
desired
to
be
of
good
service
to
his
father
and
here
was
an
opportunity
a
consideration
that
partially
reconciled
him
to
the
inevitable
change
at
that
time
about
one
hundred
and
years
ago
boys
were
put
to
hard
work
much
earlier
than
they
are
now
they
had
very
small
opportunities
for
acquiring
knowledge
and
the
boys
who
did
not
go
to
school
after
they
were
ten
years
old
were
more
in
number
than
those
who
did
besides
the
schools
were
very
poor
in
comparison
with
those
of
our
day
they
offered
very
slim
advantages
to
the
young
it
was
not
unusual
therefore
for
lads
as
young
as
benjamin
to
be
made
to
work
benjamin
was
somewhat
deficient
in
arithmetic
as
his
father
said
and
he
had
given
little
attention
to
penmanship
he
did
not
take
to
the
science
of
numbers
as
he
did
to
other
studies
he
allowed
his
dislike
to
interpose
and
hinder
his
progress
i
do
not
like
arithmetic
very
well
he
said
to
his
father
perhaps
not
but
boys
must
study
some
things
they
do
not
like
his
father
replied
it
is
the
only
way
of
preparing
them
for
usefulness
you
will
not
accomplish
much
in
any
business
without
a
good
knowledge
of
arithmetic
it
is
of
use
almost
everywhere
i
know
that
said
benjamin
and
i
shall
master
it
if
i
can
whether
i
like
it
or
not
i
am
willing
to
do
what
you
think
is
best
i
hope
you
will
always
be
as
willing
to
yield
to
my
judgment
it
is
a
good
sign
for
any
boy
to
accept
cheerfully
the
plans
of
his
father
who
has
had
more
experience
benjamin
was
usually
very
prompt
to
obey
his
parents
even
when
he
did
not
exactly
see
the
necessity
of
their
commands
he
understood
full
well
that
obedience
was
a
law
of
the
household
which
could
not
be
violated
with
impunity
therefore
he
wisely
obeyed
his
father
was
quite
rigid
in
his
requirements
a
puritan
of
the
olden
stamp
who
ruled
his
own
house
among
other
things
he
required
his
children
to
observe
the
sabbath
by
abstaining
from
labor
and
amusements
reading
the
scriptures
and
attending
public
worship
a
walk
in
the
streets
a
call
upon
a
youthful
friend
or
the
reading
of
books
not
strictly
religious
on
sunday
were
acts
not
tolerated
in
his
family
a
child
might
wish
to
stay
away
from
the
house
of
god
on
the
sabbath
but
it
was
not
permitted
going
to
meeting
was
a
rule
in
the
family
as
irrevocable
as
the
laws
of
the
medes
and
persians
it
was
fortunate
for
benjamin
that
he
belonged
to
such
a
family
for
he
possessed
an
imperious
will
that
needed
to
be
brought
into
constant
subjection
though
of
a
pleasant
and
happy
disposition
the
sequel
will
show
that
but
for
his
strict
obedience
his
great
talents
would
have
been
lost
to
the
world
nor
did
he
grow
restless
and
impatient
under
these
rigid
parental
rules
nor
cherish
less
affection
for
his
parents
in
consequence
he
accepted
them
as
a
matter
of
course
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
sought
to
evade
them
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
influence
of
such
discipline
was
good
in
forming
his
character
he
certainly
honored
his
father
and
mother
as
long
as
he
lived
in
ripe
manhood
when
his
parents
were
old
and
infirm
and
he
lived
in
philadelphia
he
was
wont
to
perform
frequent
journeys
from
that
city
to
boston
to
visit
them
it
was
on
one
of
these
journeys
that
the
following
incident
is
related
of
him
landlords
and
other
people
were
very
inquisitive
at
that
time
they
often
pressed
their
inquiries
beyond
the
bounds
of
propriety
at
a
certain
hotel
the
landlord
had
done
this
to
franklin
and
he
resolved
on
his
next
visit
to
administer
a
sharp
rebuke
to
the
innkeeper
so
on
his
next
visit
franklin
requested
the
landlord
to
call
the
members
of
his
family
together
as
he
had
something
important
to
communicate
the
landlord
hastened
to
fulfill
his
request
and
very
soon
the
family
were
together
in
one
room
when
franklin
addressed
them
as
follows
my
name
is
benjamin
franklin
i
am
a
printer
by
trade
i
live
when
at
home
in
philadelphia
in
boston
i
have
a
father
a
good
old
man
who
taught
me
when
i
was
a
boy
to
read
my
bible
and
say
my
prayers
i
have
ever
since
thought
it
my
duty
to
visit
and
pay
my
respects
to
such
a
father
and
i
am
on
that
errand
to
boston
now
this
is
all
i
can
recollect
at
present
of
myself
that
i
think
worth
telling
you
but
if
you
can
think
of
any
thing
else
that
you
wish
to
know
about
me
i
beg
you
to
out
with
it
at
once
that
i
may
answer
and
so
give
you
an
opportunity
to
get
me
something
to
eat
for
i
long
to
be
on
my
journey
that
i
may
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
my
family
and
business
where
i
most
of
all
delight
to
be
a
more
cutting
rebuke
was
never
administered
the
landlord
took
in
the
full
significance
of
the
act
and
learned
a
good
lesson
therefrom
it
is
doubtful
if
his
inquisitiveness
ever
ran
away
with
him
again
but
the
narrative
is
given
here
to
show
that
the
strict
rules
of
his
father
house
did
not
diminish
filial
affection
but
rather
solidified
and
perpetuated
it
it
is
good
for
boys
who
are
likely
to
want
their
own
way
to
be
brought
under
exact
rules
franklin
would
have
gone
to
ruin
if
he
had
had
his
way
the
evil
tendencies
of
boyhood
need
constant
restraint
obedience
at
home
leads
to
obedience
in
the
school
and
state
sir
robert
peel
ascribed
his
success
in
life
to
such
a
home
and
he
related
the
following
interesting
incident
to
illustrate
the
sort
of
obedience
that
was
required
and
practised
in
it
a
neighbor
son
called
one
day
to
solicit
his
company
and
that
of
his
brothers
upon
an
excursion
he
was
a
young
man
of
fine
address
intelligent
smart
and
promising
though
fond
of
fun
and
frolic
he
was
a
fashionable
young
man
too
we
should
call
him
a
now
he
wore
dark
brown
hair
tied
behind
with
blue
ribbon
had
clear
mirthful
eyes
wore
boots
that
reached
above
his
knees
and
a
scarlet
coat
with
gold
lace
on
the
cuffs
the
collar
and
the
skirts
with
a
long
waistcoat
of
blue
silk
his
breeches
were
buckskin
his
hat
was
set
jauntily
higher
on
the
right
than
on
the
left
side
his
name
was
harry
garland
to
his
request
that
william
henry
and
robert
might
go
with
him
their
father
replied
no
they
can
not
go
out
i
have
work
for
them
to
do
and
they
must
never
let
pleasure
usurp
the
place
of
labor
the
boys
wanted
to
go
badly
but
there
was
no
use
in
teasing
for
the
privilege
it
would
only
make
a
bad
matter
worse
our
father
yea
was
yea
and
his
nay
nay
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
the
three
brothers
of
the
peel
family
became
renowned
in
their
country
brilliant
progress
but
harry
garland
the
idle
foppish
youth
who
had
his
own
way
and
lived
for
pleasure
became
a
ruined
spendthrift
the
fact
verifies
the
divine
promise
honor
thy
father
and
mother
which
is
the
first
commandment
with
promise
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
thou
mayest
live
long
on
the
earth
true
filial
love
appears
to
conciliate
the
whole
world
by
its
consistent
and
beautiful
expression
such
an
act
as
that
of
the
great
engineer
george
stephenson
who
took
the
first
one
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
he
earned
saved
from
a
year
wages
and
paid
his
blind
old
debts
and
then
removed
both
father
and
mother
to
a
comfortable
tenement
at
killingworth
where
he
supported
them
by
the
labor
of
his
hands
awakens
our
admiration
and
leads
us
to
expect
that
the
author
will
achieve
success
when
the
statue
of
franklin
was
unveiled
in
boston
in
a
barouche
appeared
in
the
procession
which
carried
eight
brothers
all
of
whom
received
franklin
medals
at
the
mayhew
school
in
their
boyhood
sons
of
john
hall
all
of
them
were
known
to
fame
by
their
worth
of
character
and
wide
influence
as
the
barouche
in
which
they
rode
came
into
state
street
from
merchants
row
these
brothers
rose
up
in
the
carriage
and
stood
with
uncovered
heads
while
passing
a
window
at
which
their
aged
and
revered
mother
was
sitting
an
act
of
filial
regard
so
impressive
and
beautiful
as
to
fill
the
hearts
of
all
beholders
with
profound
respect
for
the
obedient
and
loving
sons
they
never
performed
a
more
noble
deed
in
the
public
estimation
than
this
one
of
reverence
for
a
worthy
parent
we
have
made
this
digression
to
show
that
franklin
home
with
its
rigid
discipline
was
the
representative
home
of
his
country
in
which
the
great
and
good
of
every
generation
laid
the
foundation
of
their
useful
careers
benjamin
was
taken
out
of
school
as
his
father
decided
and
was
put
under
brownwell
tuition
in
arithmetic
and
penmanship
as
he
had
endeared
himself
to
williams
teacher
of
the
public
school
so
he
endeared
himself
to
brownwell
by
his
obedience
studious
habits
and
rapid
progress
he
did
not
become
an
expert
in
arithmetic
though
by
dint
of
persistent
effort
he
made
creditable
progress
in
the
study
in
penmanship
he
excelled
and
acquired
an
easy
attractive
style
that
was
of
great
service
to
him
through
life
vi
from
school
to
while
benjamin
was
attending
brownwell
school
his
uncle
benjamin
for
whom
he
was
named
came
over
from
england
his
wife
and
children
were
dead
except
his
son
samuel
who
had
immigrated
to
this
country
he
had
been
unfortunate
in
business
also
and
lost
what
little
property
he
possessed
with
all
the
rest
the
infirmities
of
age
were
creeping
over
him
so
that
nearly
all
the
ties
that
bound
him
to
his
native
land
were
sundered
and
so
he
decided
to
spend
the
remnant
of
his
days
in
boston
where
samuel
lived
samuel
franklin
was
an
unmarried
young
man
intelligent
and
enterprising
willing
and
anxious
to
support
his
father
in
this
country
but
having
no
family
and
home
to
which
to
introduce
his
aged
parent
uncle
benjamin
became
a
member
of
his
brother
family
and
continued
a
member
of
it
about
four
years
or
until
samuel
was
married
when
he
went
to
live
with
him
uncle
benjamin
was
very
much
pained
to
find
that
his
namesake
had
relinquished
the
purpose
of
becoming
a
minister
his
heart
was
set
on
his
giving
his
to
the
church
any
body
can
make
candles
he
said
but
talents
are
required
for
the
ministry
and
from
all
i
learn
benjamin
has
the
talents
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
rejoined
josiah
who
seemed
to
think
that
his
brother
remark
was
not
altogether
complimentary
talents
are
required
for
the
ministry
as
you
say
but
judgment
tact
and
industry
are
required
to
manufacture
candles
successfully
a
fool
would
not
make
much
headway
in
the
business
i
meant
no
reflection
upon
boston
and
a
smile
played
over
his
face
as
uncle
benjamin
said
it
but
i
really
think
that
benjamin
is
too
talented
for
the
business
five
talents
can
make
candles
well
enough
let
ten
talents
serve
the
church
well
that
is
sound
doctrine
i
shall
not
object
to
that
replied
josiah
but
if
poverty
makes
it
impossible
for
ten
talents
to
serve
the
church
it
is
better
that
they
make
candles
than
to
do
nothing
is
indispensable
it
is
a
necessary
business
and
therefore
it
is
honorable
and
useful
the
business
is
well
enough
a
man
can
be
a
man
and
make
candles
this
way
of
lighting
dwellings
is
really
a
great
invention
and
it
will
be
a
long
time
i
think
when
any
thing
better
will
supersede
it
this
new
country
is
fortunate
in
having
such
a
light
so
cheap
and
convenient
so
that
the
business
is
to
be
respected
and
valued
but
benjamin
is
greater
than
the
business
the
last
remark
set
forth
uncle
benjamin
views
exactly
he
really
supposed
that
no
improvement
could
be
made
in
the
method
of
lighting
houses
and
shops
by
candles
that
was
the
opinion
of
all
the
franklins
to
them
a
was
the
climax
of
advancement
on
that
line
if
a
prophet
had
arisen
and
foretold
the
coming
of
gas
and
electricity
for
the
lighting
of
both
houses
and
streets
in
the
next
century
he
would
have
been
regarded
as
insane
too
crazy
even
to
make
candles
progress
was
not
a
prevailing
idea
of
that
day
it
did
not
enter
into
any
questions
of
the
times
as
a
factor
if
succeeding
generations
should
maintain
the
standard
of
theirs
enjoying
as
many
privileges
it
would
be
all
that
could
be
reasonably
expected
candles
would
be
needed
until
the
new
heaven
and
new
earth
of
revelation
appeared
possibly
they
would
have
believed
that
their
method
of
lighting
would
be
popular
in
that
great
city
the
holy
jerusalem
had
it
not
been
declared
in
the
bible
that
they
will
need
no
candle
because
there
shall
be
no
night
there
uncle
benjamin
added
what
really
comforted
josiah
of
course
if
you
are
not
able
to
send
benjamin
to
college
he
ca
go
and
that
ends
it
if
i
were
able
to
pay
the
bills
i
should
be
only
too
glad
to
do
it
benjamin
is
a
remarkable
boy
and
his
talents
will
manifest
themselves
whatever
his
pursuit
may
be
he
will
not
always
make
candles
for
a
living
you
may
depend
on
that
perhaps
not
responded
josiah
if
providence
introduces
him
into
a
better
calling
i
shall
not
object
but
i
want
he
should
be
satisfied
with
this
until
the
better
one
comes
as
the
time
drew
near
for
benjamin
to
exchange
school
for
the
his
disappointment
increased
to
exchange
school
which
he
liked
so
well
for
a
dirty
business
that
he
did
not
like
at
all
was
almost
too
much
for
his
flesh
and
blood
his
feelings
revolted
against
the
uncongenial
trade
you
do
not
know
how
i
dread
to
go
into
the
to
make
it
my
business
for
life
he
said
to
his
mother
i
feel
worse
and
worse
about
it
we
are
all
sorry
that
you
are
obliged
to
do
it
replied
franklin
i
am
sure
that
your
father
would
have
made
any
sacrifice
possible
to
send
you
to
college
but
it
was
simply
impossible
you
will
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
god
may
open
the
way
to
employment
that
will
be
more
congenial
to
you
some
time
for
the
present
he
means
that
you
should
help
your
father
i
have
no
doubt
of
that
and
you
must
do
the
best
for
him
that
you
can
that
is
what
i
intend
to
do
however
much
i
dislike
the
business
i
want
to
help
father
all
i
can
he
has
a
hard
time
enough
to
provide
for
us
benjamin
expressed
himself
as
frankly
to
his
father
adding
i
really
wish
you
would
engage
in
some
other
business
and
starve
too
rejoined
his
father
in
such
times
as
these
we
must
be
willing
to
do
what
will
insure
us
a
livelihood
i
know
of
no
other
business
that
would
give
me
a
living
at
present
certainly
none
that
i
am
qualified
to
pursue
well
i
should
rather
make
soap
and
candles
than
starve
on
the
whole
benjamin
remarked
in
reply
but
nothing
short
of
starvation
could
make
me
willing
to
follow
the
business
one
other
thing
ought
to
make
you
willing
to
do
such
work
added
his
father
a
determination
to
be
industrious
idleness
is
the
parent
of
vice
boys
like
you
should
be
industrious
even
if
they
do
not
earn
their
salt
it
is
better
for
them
to
work
for
nothing
than
to
be
idle
i
think
they
better
save
their
strength
till
they
can
earn
something
said
benjamin
people
must
like
to
work
better
than
i
do
to
work
for
nothing
you
do
not
understand
me
i
mean
to
say
that
it
is
so
important
for
the
young
to
form
industrious
habits
that
they
better
work
for
nothing
than
to
be
idle
if
they
are
idle
when
they
are
young
they
will
be
so
when
they
become
men
and
idleness
will
finally
be
their
ruin
devil
tempts
all
other
men
but
idle
men
tempt
the
devil
and
i
hope
that
you
will
never
consent
to
verify
the
proverb
franklin
had
been
a
close
observer
all
his
life
and
he
had
noticed
that
industry
was
characteristic
of
those
who
accomplished
any
thing
commendable
consequently
he
insisted
that
his
children
should
have
employment
he
allowed
no
drones
in
his
family
hive
all
must
be
busy
as
bees
all
had
some
thing
to
do
as
soon
as
they
were
old
enough
to
toil
under
such
influences
benjamin
was
reared
and
he
grew
up
to
be
as
much
in
love
with
industry
as
his
father
was
some
of
his
best
counsels
and
most
interesting
sayings
when
he
became
a
man
related
to
this
subject
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
early
discipline
on
this
line
gave
to
the
world
his
best
sayings
on
this
and
other
subjects
the
following
are
some
of
his
counsels
referred
to
sloth
like
rust
consumes
faster
than
labor
wears
while
the
used
key
is
always
bright
but
dost
thou
love
life
then
do
not
squander
time
for
that
is
the
stuff
life
is
made
of
if
time
be
of
all
things
the
most
precious
wasting
time
must
be
the
greatest
prodigality
sloth
makes
all
things
difficult
but
industry
all
easy
and
he
that
riseth
late
must
trot
all
day
and
shall
scarce
overtake
his
business
at
night
while
laziness
travels
so
slowly
that
poverty
soon
overtakes
him
at
the
house
hunger
looks
in
but
dares
not
enter
diligence
is
the
mother
of
good
luck
and
god
gives
all
things
to
industry
one
is
worth
two
drive
thy
business
let
not
thy
business
drive
thee
god
helps
those
that
help
themselves
he
wrote
to
a
young
tradesman
as
follows
remember
that
time
is
money
he
that
can
earn
ten
shillings
a
day
by
his
labor
and
goes
abroad
or
sits
idle
that
day
though
he
spend
but
sixpence
during
his
diversion
or
idleness
ought
not
to
reckon
the
only
expense
he
has
really
spent
or
rather
thrown
away
five
shillings
besides
the
sound
of
your
hammer
at
five
in
the
morning
or
nine
at
night
heard
by
a
creditor
makes
him
easy
six
months
longer
but
if
he
sees
you
at
a
or
hears
your
voice
at
a
tavern
when
you
should
be
at
work
he
sends
for
his
money
the
next
day
demands
it
before
he
can
receive
it
in
a
lump
benjamin
became
a
better
teacher
than
his
father
and
no
doubt
was
indebted
to
his
father
for
the
progress
had
he
gone
to
college
instead
of
the
the
world
might
not
have
received
his
legacy
of
proverbial
wisdom
for
these
were
the
outcome
of
secular
discipline
when
he
was
brought
into
direct
contact
with
the
realities
of
business
and
hardship
colleges
do
not
teach
proverbs
they
do
not
make
practical
men
but
learned
men
practical
men
are
made
by
observation
and
experience
in
the
daily
work
of
life
in
that
way
franklin
was
made
the
remarkable
practical
man
that
he
was
had
uncle
benjamin
lived
to
read
such
words
of
wisdom
from
the
pen
of
his
namesake
when
his
reputation
had
spread
over
two
hemispheres
he
would
have
said
i
told
you
so
did
i
not
say
that
benjamin
would
not
always
make
candles
did
i
not
prophesy
that
he
would
make
his
mark
in
manhood
benjamin
became
a
when
he
was
ten
years
old
and
he
meant
to
make
a
good
one
though
the
business
was
repulsive
to
his
feelings
at
first
his
industry
and
tact
were
all
that
his
father
could
desire
he
devoted
the
hours
of
each
workday
closely
to
the
trade
though
his
love
for
it
did
not
increase
at
all
if
any
thing
he
disliked
it
more
and
more
as
the
weeks
and
months
dragged
on
perhaps
he
became
neglectful
and
somewhat
inefficient
for
he
said
in
his
manhood
that
his
father
often
repeated
to
him
this
passage
from
the
bible
seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
business
he
shall
stand
before
kings
he
shall
not
stand
before
mean
men
when
benjamin
became
the
famous
franklin
and
was
in
the
habit
of
standing
before
kings
he
often
recalled
this
maxim
of
solomon
which
his
father
dinged
rebukingly
in
his
ear
it
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
recollections
of
his
life
franklin
watched
his
boy
in
the
closely
to
see
whether
his
dislike
for
it
increased
or
diminished
his
anxiety
for
him
was
great
he
did
not
wish
to
compel
him
to
make
candles
against
an
increasing
desire
to
escape
from
the
hardship
he
had
great
sympathy
for
him
too
in
his
disappointment
at
leaving
school
and
it
was
a
hard
lot
for
such
a
lover
of
school
and
study
to
give
them
up
forever
at
ten
years
of
age
no
more
school
after
that
small
opportunity
indeed
in
comparison
with
those
enjoyed
by
nearly
every
boy
at
the
present
day
now
they
are
just
beginning
to
learn
at
this
early
age
from
ten
they
can
look
forward
to
six
eight
or
ten
years
in
school
and
college
franklin
saw
from
month
to
month
that
his
son
more
and
more
disliked
his
business
though
little
was
said
by
either
of
them
actions
speak
louder
than
words
as
franklin
saw
to
his
regret
for
it
was
as
clear
as
noonday
that
benjamin
would
never
be
contented
in
the
he
did
his
best
however
to
make
the
situation
attractive
allowed
him
frequent
opportunities
for
play
and
praised
his
habit
of
reading
in
the
evening
and
at
all
other
times
possible
still
a
did
not
attract
him
it
shed
light
but
it
was
not
the
sort
of
light
that
benjamin
wanted
to
radiate
one
day
nearly
two
years
after
he
engaged
in
the
he
said
to
his
father
i
wish
i
could
do
something
else
i
can
never
like
this
work
what
else
would
you
like
to
do
inquired
his
father
i
would
like
to
go
to
sea
was
the
prompt
and
straight
reply
and
it
startled
franklin
it
was
just
what
he
feared
all
along
he
was
afraid
that
compulsion
to
make
him
a
might
cause
him
to
run
away
and
go
to
sea
as
his
eldest
son
josiah
did
emphatically
his
father
said
go
to
sea
benjamin
never
never
with
my
consent
never
say
another
word
about
it
and
never
think
about
it
for
that
is
out
of
the
question
i
shall
never
give
my
consent
and
i
know
your
mother
never
will
it
was
too
much
for
me
when
your
brother
broke
away
from
us
and
went
to
sea
i
can
not
pass
through
another
such
trial
so
you
must
not
persist
in
your
wish
if
you
would
not
send
me
down
to
the
grave
josiah
the
eldest
son
named
for
his
father
became
dissatisfied
with
his
home
when
benjamin
was
an
infant
ran
away
and
shipped
as
a
sailor
the
parents
knew
not
where
he
had
gone
month
after
month
they
waited
in
deep
sorrow
for
tidings
from
their
wayward
boy
but
no
tidings
came
years
rolled
on
and
still
the
wanderer
was
away
somewhere
they
knew
not
where
morning
noon
and
night
the
memory
of
him
lay
heavy
upon
their
hearts
turning
their
cup
of
earthly
joy
to
bitterness
and
furrowing
their
faces
with
anxiety
and
grief
he
might
be
dead
he
might
be
alive
and
in
want
in
a
strange
land
the
uncertainty
and
suspense
hanging
over
his
fate
magnified
their
sorrow
the
outlook
was
unpleasant
there
was
no
comfort
in
it
they
appealed
to
god
before
him
they
pleaded
for
their
prodigal
son
for
his
safety
his
return
his
salvation
not
long
after
benjamin
had
expressed
his
longing
for
the
sea
when
almost
the
last
hope
of
seeing
the
lost
son
again
had
vanished
josiah
returned
and
startled
his
parents
by
his
sudden
and
unexpected
presence
they
could
scarcely
believe
their
eyes
twelve
years
and
hard
service
before
the
mast
had
wrought
a
great
change
in
his
appearance
he
was
a
youth
when
he
ran
away
he
was
a
man
now
toughened
by
exposure
dark
as
an
indian
stalwart
and
rough
but
still
the
eldest
son
and
brother
josiah
franklin
jr
they
were
glad
to
see
him
they
rejoiced
more
over
this
one
returning
prodigal
than
they
did
over
the
sixteen
that
went
not
astray
the
father
said
bring
forth
the
best
robe
and
put
it
on
him
and
put
a
ring
on
his
finger
and
shoes
on
his
feet
and
bring
hither
the
fatted
calf
and
kill
it
and
let
us
eat
and
be
merry
for
this
my
son
was
dead
and
is
alive
again
he
was
lost
and
is
found
and
they
began
to
be
merry
it
was
the
first
time
in
twelve
years
that
family
had
been
merry
past
sorrows
were
forgotten
in
the
joy
of
their
meeting
on
that
day
a
new
life
began
around
that
hearthstone
father
and
mother
began
to
live
again
as
if
they
had
never
shed
a
tear
or
felt
a
pang
they
looked
into
the
future
with
cheerful
hope
and
expectation
to
return
to
benjamin
his
father
quick
and
sharp
reply
left
no
room
for
doubt
if
he
went
to
sea
it
must
be
against
his
father
will
he
turned
to
his
mother
but
was
repulsed
with
equal
decision
you
surprise
me
benjamin
want
to
go
to
sea
you
must
not
harbor
such
a
thought
is
it
not
enough
that
we
have
lost
one
son
in
that
way
you
might
have
known
that
i
should
never
give
my
consent
i
should
almost
as
lief
bury
you
how
can
you
want
to
leave
your
good
home
and
all
your
friends
to
live
in
a
ship
exposed
to
storms
and
death
all
the
time
it
is
not
because
i
do
not
love
my
home
and
friends
but
i
have
a
desire
to
sail
on
a
voyage
to
some
other
country
i
like
the
water
and
nothing
would
suit
me
better
than
to
be
a
you
surprise
and
pain
me
benjamin
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
if
you
do
not
like
work
in
the
then
choose
some
other
occupation
but
never
think
of
going
to
sea
i
would
choose
any
other
occupation
under
the
sun
than
replied
benjamin
i
have
tried
to
like
it
for
two
years
but
dislike
it
more
and
more
if
i
could
have
my
own
way
i
would
not
go
to
the
factory
another
day
perhaps
the
opposition
of
his
parents
would
have
prevented
his
going
to
sea
but
the
return
of
josiah
with
no
words
of
praise
for
the
calling
might
have
exerted
a
decided
influence
in
leading
him
to
abandon
the
idea
altogether
uncle
benjamin
of
course
could
not
tolerate
the
idea
of
his
nephew
becoming
a
sailor
with
his
poor
opinion
of
the
he
would
have
him
pursue
the
business
all
his
life
rather
than
become
a
sailor
do
any
thing
rather
than
follow
the
seas
he
said
if
you
want
to
throw
yourself
away
body
and
soul
go
before
the
mast
but
if
you
want
to
be
somebody
and
do
something
that
will
make
you
respectable
and
honored
among
men
never
ship
for
a
voyage
long
or
short
a
boy
of
one
talent
can
be
a
but
a
boy
of
ten
talents
ought
to
be
above
that
business
and
find
his
place
on
a
higher
plane
of
life
vii
choosing
a
trade
and
stealing
sport
and
franklin
canvassed
the
subject
thoroughly
and
wisely
decided
that
benjamin
might
engage
in
some
other
pursuit
to
be
successful
a
man
must
love
his
calling
remarked
franklin
and
benjamin
hates
his
he
appears
to
go
to
each
day
work
with
a
dread
and
as
long
as
he
feels
so
he
will
not
accomplish
any
thing
you
have
come
to
a
wise
decision
i
think
responded
uncle
benjamin
ordinarily
a
boy
should
choose
his
own
occupation
he
may
be
instructed
and
assisted
by
his
parents
but
if
he
makes
his
own
selection
he
is
likely
to
choose
what
he
has
tact
and
taste
for
certainly
i
would
not
compel
a
son
to
follow
a
business
that
he
hates
as
benjamin
does
that
is
true
on
the
whole
but
circumstances
alter
cases
remarked
franklin
i
believe
i
shall
take
him
around
to
examine
different
trades
in
town
and
he
can
see
for
himself
and
choose
what
he
likes
best
he
has
seemed
to
be
interested
in
my
son
business
added
uncle
benjamin
his
son
samuel
was
a
cutler
and
he
had
established
the
cutlery
business
in
boston
in
which
he
was
quite
successful
well
he
can
look
into
that
i
have
no
objections
to
it
it
is
a
good
business
i
will
let
him
examine
others
however
and
take
his
choice
i
want
he
should
settle
the
matter
of
occupation
now
for
life
i
do
not
want
to
go
through
another
experience
with
him
such
as
i
have
been
through
two
years
in
the
franklin
had
evidently
acquired
new
views
about
boys
judging
from
his
last
remarks
he
saw
but
one
way
out
of
the
difficulty
choice
of
an
occupation
was
a
more
important
matter
than
he
had
dreamed
of
however
he
had
acted
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
that
day
to
choose
occupations
for
sons
without
the
least
regard
to
fitness
or
their
preferences
boys
must
not
have
their
own
way
in
that
matter
any
more
than
they
should
in
other
things
was
the
opinion
of
that
age
but
progress
has
been
made
on
this
line
it
is
thought
now
that
the
more
nearly
the
aptitudes
of
the
person
fit
the
occupation
the
more
congenial
and
successful
is
the
career
to
follow
the
natural
bent
whenever
it
is
possible
appears
to
be
eminently
wise
for
square
men
should
be
put
into
square
holes
and
round
men
into
round
holes
failing
to
regard
the
drift
of
one
being
in
the
choice
of
an
occupation
is
almost
sure
to
put
square
men
into
round
holes
and
round
men
into
square
holes
in
this
way
good
mechanics
have
been
spoiled
to
make
poor
clergymen
or
merchants
and
a
good
minister
spoiled
to
make
a
commonplace
artisan
the
celebrated
english
engineer
smeaton
displayed
a
marvellous
ability
for
mechanical
pursuits
even
in
his
childhood
before
he
had
donned
jacket
and
pants
in
the
place
of
short
dress
his
father
discovered
him
on
the
top
of
the
barn
putting
up
a
windmill
that
he
had
made
but
he
paid
no
regard
to
the
boy
aptitude
for
this
or
that
position
he
was
determined
to
make
a
lawyer
of
him
and
sent
him
to
school
with
that
end
in
view
but
the
boy
thought
more
of
windmills
and
engines
than
he
did
of
euclid
or
homer
and
the
result
was
unfavorable
his
father
was
trying
to
crowd
a
square
boy
into
a
round
hole
and
it
was
repugnant
to
the
born
engineer
josiah
franklin
tried
to
do
with
benjamin
just
what
smeaton
tried
to
do
with
his
son
squeeze
a
square
boy
into
a
round
hole
that
was
a
mistake
the
son
did
not
like
the
operation
and
rebelled
against
the
squeezing
this
created
trouble
for
both
until
with
the
aid
of
uncle
benjamin
josiah
discovered
the
way
out
of
the
difficulty
benjamin
was
delighted
when
his
father
disclosed
to
him
his
new
plan
anything
is
preferable
to
making
candles
he
said
it
will
not
take
me
long
to
choose
something
in
place
of
a
you
have
considerable
mechanical
ingenuity
his
father
said
you
like
to
work
with
tools
and
you
can
see
how
tools
are
handled
in
different
trades
how
would
you
like
your
cousin
samuel
business
i
should
like
it
vastly
better
than
making
candles
though
i
have
not
examined
it
much
i
can
tell
better
when
have
looked
in
upon
other
trades
when
shall
we
go
begin
and
first
call
upon
your
cousin
samuel
his
cutlery
trade
is
good
and
it
must
increase
as
the
population
grows
then
we
will
examine
other
kinds
of
business
it
will
take
some
time
to
go
the
rounds
on
the
morrow
as
agreed
upon
they
went
forth
upon
the
memorable
errand
benjamin
felt
like
an
uncaged
bird
and
was
highly
elated
by
his
prospects
their
first
call
was
at
samuel
shop
where
they
could
see
a
line
of
cutlery
that
was
quite
ample
for
that
day
samuel
explained
his
methods
use
of
tools
and
benjamin
listened
he
was
well
pleased
with
the
trade
as
samuel
saw
at
once
who
encouraged
him
to
choose
it
i
was
never
sorry
that
i
learned
the
business
he
said
there
is
no
easier
way
of
getting
a
living
and
the
work
is
interesting
because
it
requires
some
ingenuity
and
skill
benjamin
has
both
and
will
succeed
but
i
want
he
should
examine
other
trades
replied
his
father
when
he
has
taken
in
several
he
will
know
more
what
he
wants
perhaps
he
will
not
know
as
well
what
he
wants
rejoined
samuel
if
he
is
like
some
boys
he
will
be
less
settled
in
his
mind
what
to
choose
than
he
is
now
my
mind
is
partly
settled
now
said
benjamin
i
should
choose
any
trade
on
earth
in
preference
to
making
candles
and
boiling
soap
i
should
be
content
with
your
business
next
they
called
on
a
brazier
who
manufactured
many
articles
in
brass
this
was
entirely
new
to
benjamin
he
had
never
seen
any
thing
of
the
kind
before
and
he
examined
the
methods
of
work
with
much
interest
the
brazier
was
communicative
and
explained
matters
fully
and
clearly
at
the
same
time
assuring
benjamin
that
he
would
like
to
teach
a
boy
like
him
in
like
manner
they
visited
a
joiner
or
carpenter
as
he
is
called
in
new
england
now
also
a
turner
who
formed
various
things
with
a
lathe
also
a
silversmith
bricklayer
and
a
part
of
several
days
was
occupied
in
this
examination
and
it
was
time
well
spent
for
it
put
much
information
into
benjamin
head
and
enlarged
his
ideas
referring
to
the
matter
when
he
had
become
an
old
man
he
said
it
has
ever
since
been
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
good
workmen
handle
their
tools
and
it
has
often
been
useful
to
me
to
have
learned
so
much
by
it
as
to
be
able
to
do
some
trifling
jobs
in
the
house
when
a
workman
was
not
at
hand
and
to
construct
little
machines
for
my
experiments
at
the
moment
when
the
intention
of
making
these
was
warm
in
my
mind
i
like
samuel
trade
as
well
as
any
benjamin
remarked
after
the
trips
of
examination
were
concluded
and
his
father
rejoiced
to
hear
it
from
the
start
franklin
showed
that
none
of
the
trades
suited
him
so
well
as
his
nephew
so
that
he
was
particularly
gratified
to
hear
the
above
remark
do
you
like
it
well
enough
to
choose
it
benjamin
yes
father
on
the
whole
i
think
i
shall
like
it
best
of
any
and
cutlery
will
always
be
needed
we
will
understand
then
that
you
choose
that
trade
and
i
will
see
samuel
at
once
it
may
be
best
for
you
to
go
into
the
shop
for
a
short
time
before
i
make
a
bargain
with
him
then
he
will
know
what
you
can
do
and
you
will
know
how
you
like
it
at
that
time
it
was
customary
to
bind
boys
to
their
employers
in
different
pursuits
until
years
of
age
benjamin
was
twelve
and
if
he
should
be
bound
to
his
cousin
as
was
the
custom
it
would
be
for
nine
years
for
this
reason
it
was
a
step
not
to
be
hastily
taken
if
a
short
service
in
the
shop
should
prove
favorable
for
both
sides
the
long
apprenticeship
could
be
entered
upon
more
intelligently
and
cheerfully
franklin
lost
no
time
in
securing
a
place
in
samuel
shop
both
parties
agreed
that
it
would
be
best
for
benjamin
to
spend
a
brief
period
in
the
business
before
settling
the
terms
of
apprenticeship
accordingly
he
entered
upon
his
new
trade
immediately
and
was
much
pleased
with
it
it
was
so
different
from
the
work
of
and
required
so
much
more
thought
and
ingenuity
that
he
enjoyed
it
he
went
to
each
day
work
with
a
light
and
cheerful
heart
he
was
soon
another
boy
in
appearance
contented
happy
and
hopeful
samuel
recognized
his
ingenuity
and
willingness
to
work
and
prophesied
that
he
would
become
an
expert
cutler
he
was
ready
to
receive
him
as
an
apprentice
and
benjamin
was
willing
to
be
bound
to
him
until
he
was
years
of
age
but
when
franklin
conferred
with
samuel
as
to
the
terms
of
the
apprenticeship
they
could
not
agree
the
latter
demanded
an
exorbitant
fee
for
his
apprenticeship
which
the
former
did
not
feel
able
to
pay
with
good
nature
they
discussed
the
subject
with
reference
to
an
agreement
on
the
terms
but
samuel
was
immovable
he
had
but
one
price
benjamin
might
stay
or
go
very
much
to
the
disappointment
of
both
father
and
son
the
plan
failed
and
was
abandoned
benjamin
was
afloat
again
he
had
no
disposition
to
return
to
nor
did
his
father
desire
that
he
should
he
must
choose
an
occupation
again
as
it
turned
out
it
would
have
been
better
to
settle
the
terms
of
apprenticeship
in
the
first
place
it
has
been
said
that
there
is
no
loss
without
some
gain
so
there
was
some
gain
to
benjamin
he
was
sadly
disappointed
and
he
had
given
some
time
to
a
trade
that
amounted
to
nothing
but
it
was
not
all
loss
he
had
learned
much
about
the
trades
the
importance
of
a
trade
to
every
boy
and
its
necessity
as
a
means
of
livelihood
and
he
never
lost
the
lesson
which
he
learned
at
that
time
in
his
ripe
manhood
he
wrote
he
that
hath
a
trade
hath
an
estate
he
that
hath
a
calling
hath
an
office
of
honor
he
believed
that
a
trade
was
as
good
as
a
farm
for
a
livelihood
and
that
a
necessary
calling
was
as
honorable
as
a
public
office
of
distinction
how
much
his
early
discipline
about
trades
had
to
do
with
these
noble
sentiments
of
his
mature
life
we
may
not
say
but
very
much
without
doubt
while
benjamin
was
waiting
for
something
to
turn
up
an
incident
occurred
which
may
be
rehearsed
in
this
place
he
was
already
an
expert
in
swimming
and
rowing
and
he
loved
the
water
and
a
boat
passionately
he
was
fond
of
fishing
also
and
there
was
a
marsh
flooded
at
high
tides
where
the
boys
caught
minnows
here
they
repaired
for
a
fine
time
one
day
benjamin
and
several
companions
all
aboard
exclaimed
benjamin
as
he
bounded
into
the
boat
lying
at
the
water
edge
now
for
a
ride
only
hurry
up
and
make
the
oars
fly
and
several
boys
leaped
in
after
him
from
the
shaky
trampled
quagmire
on
which
they
stood
we
shall
be
heels
over
head
in
mud
yet
said
one
of
the
number
unless
we
try
to
improve
this
marsh
there
is
certainly
danger
that
we
shall
go
through
that
shaky
place
and
we
do
not
know
where
we
shall
stop
when
we
begin
to
go
down
let
us
build
a
wharf
that
will
get
rid
of
the
quagmire
suggested
benjamin
it
wo
be
a
long
job
if
all
take
hold
where
will
you
get
your
lumber
inquired
john
nowhere
we
do
not
want
any
lumber
stones
are
better
that
is
worse
yet
to
bring
stones
so
far
and
enough
of
them
said
john
you
must
like
to
lift
better
than
i
do
and
strain
your
gizzard
in
tugging
stones
here
look
there
continued
benjamin
pointing
to
a
heap
of
stones
only
a
few
rods
distant
there
are
stones
enough
for
our
purpose
and
one
or
two
hours
is
all
the
time
we
want
to
build
a
wharf
with
them
those
stones
belong
to
the
man
who
is
preparing
to
build
a
house
there
said
fred
the
workmen
are
busy
there
now
that
may
all
be
but
they
can
afford
to
lend
them
to
us
for
a
little
while
they
will
be
just
as
good
for
their
use
after
we
have
done
with
them
there
was
the
rogue
sly
look
in
benjamin
eye
when
he
made
the
last
remark
then
you
expect
they
will
loan
them
to
you
but
i
guess
you
will
be
mistaken
responded
fred
i
will
borrow
them
in
this
way
we
will
go
this
evening
after
the
workmen
have
gone
home
and
tug
them
over
here
and
make
the
wharf
before
bedtime
benjamin
made
this
proposition
for
the
purpose
of
adding
to
their
sport
and
get
ourselves
into
trouble
thereby
answered
a
third
boy
i
will
agree
to
do
it
if
you
will
bear
all
the
blame
of
stealing
them
stealing
exclaimed
benjamin
who
was
so
bent
on
sport
that
he
had
no
thought
of
stealing
it
is
not
stealing
to
take
stones
a
man
could
not
sell
a
million
tons
of
them
for
a
copper
well
anyhow
the
man
who
has
borne
the
expense
of
drawing
them
there
wo
thank
you
for
taking
them
i
do
not
ask
them
to
thank
me
i
do
not
think
the
act
deserves
any
thanks
and
a
roguish
twinkle
of
the
eye
showed
that
benjamin
knew
he
was
doing
wrong
for
the
sake
of
getting
a
little
sport
would
it
be
a
joke
on
those
fellows
if
they
should
find
their
pile
of
stones
missing
in
the
morning
let
us
do
it
said
john
who
was
taken
with
the
idea
of
playing
off
a
joke
i
will
do
my
part
to
put
it
through
and
i
will
do
mine
and
so
will
i
and
i
too
by
this
time
all
were
willing
to
follow
benjamin
their
leader
perhaps
some
of
them
were
afraid
to
say
no
as
their
consciences
suggested
now
that
the
enterprise
was
endorsed
by
one
or
two
of
their
number
both
boys
and
men
are
quite
disposed
to
go
with
the
multitude
to
do
evil
they
are
too
cowardly
to
do
what
they
know
is
right
the
salt
marsh
bounding
a
part
of
the
where
their
boat
lay
was
tramped
into
a
quagmire
the
boys
were
wont
to
fish
there
at
high
water
and
so
many
feet
treading
on
the
spot
reduced
it
to
a
very
soft
condition
it
was
over
this
miry
marsh
that
they
proposed
to
build
a
wharf
the
evening
was
soon
there
and
the
boys
too
upon
their
rogues
errand
they
surveyed
the
pile
of
stones
and
found
it
ample
for
their
purpose
though
it
appeared
to
be
a
formidable
piece
of
work
to
remove
them
two
of
us
ca
lift
and
carry
some
of
them
said
fred
then
three
of
us
will
hitch
on
and
carry
them
replied
benjamin
they
must
all
be
worked
into
a
wharf
this
evening
let
us
begin
there
is
no
time
to
lose
the
largest
must
go
first
suggested
john
they
are
capital
stones
for
the
foundation
come
boys
let
us
make
quick
work
of
it
so
they
went
to
work
with
a
will
and
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
in
evil
as
well
as
good
it
was
unfortunate
for
benjamin
that
he
did
not
hate
such
an
enterprise
as
much
as
he
did
if
he
had
he
would
have
given
a
wide
berth
to
the
salt
marsh
and
the
wharf
project
but
neither
he
nor
his
companions
disliked
the
evil
work
in
which
there
was
sport
we
say
that
they
worked
with
a
will
and
their
perseverance
was
the
only
commendable
thing
about
the
affair
sometimes
three
or
four
of
them
worked
away
at
a
stone
rolling
it
along
or
lifting
as
necessity
required
then
one
alone
would
catch
up
a
smaller
one
and
convey
it
to
the
wharf
at
half
their
zeal
tact
and
industry
in
doing
this
wrong
would
have
made
the
or
any
other
business
a
success
the
evening
was
not
quite
spent
when
the
last
stone
was
carried
away
and
the
wharf
finished
a
work
of
art
that
answered
their
purpose
very
well
though
it
was
not
quite
as
imposing
as
commercial
wharf
is
now
and
was
not
calculated
to
receive
the
cargo
of
a
very
large
liverpool
packet
a
capital
place
now
for
fishing
exclaimed
fred
it
is
worth
all
it
cost
for
that
it
may
cost
more
than
you
think
for
before
we
get
through
with
it
suggested
john
we
know
the
real
cost
of
it
until
the
owner
finds
his
stones
among
the
missing
i
should
like
to
hear
his
remarks
morning
when
he
discovers
his
loss
remarked
benjamin
they
will
not
be
very
complimentary
i
think
i
am
more
anxious
to
know
what
he
will
do
about
it
responded
john
we
shall
find
out
before
long
no
doubt
said
benjamin
but
i
must
hurry
home
or
i
shall
have
more
trouble
there
than
anywhere
else
come
boys
let
us
go
they
hastened
to
their
homes
not
designing
to
divulge
the
labors
of
the
evening
if
they
could
possibly
avoid
interrogation
they
knew
that
their
parents
would
disapprove
of
the
deed
and
that
no
excuse
could
shield
them
from
merited
censure
not
one
of
their
consciences
was
at
ease
their
love
of
sport
had
got
the
better
of
their
love
of
and
yet
they
were
both
afraid
and
ashamed
to
tell
of
what
they
had
done
they
were
at
home
and
in
bed
and
asleep
about
as
early
as
usual
hours
passed
away
during
which
benjamin
fears
had
increased
rather
than
diminished
he
was
all
the
while
thinking
about
the
stones
what
the
owner
would
say
and
do
whether
he
would
learn
who
took
his
stones
away
his
conscience
was
on
duty
it
was
evening
and
franklin
took
his
seat
at
the
fireside
benjamin
was
reading
the
unattractive
tallow
candle
furnishing
him
light
benjamin
said
franklin
after
a
little
where
were
you
last
evening
if
his
father
had
fired
off
a
pistol
he
could
not
have
been
more
disturbed
his
heart
leaped
into
his
throat
he
thought
of
the
stones
he
knew
something
was
up
about
them
that
trouble
was
ahead
i
was
down
to
the
water
benjamin
replied
with
as
much
coolness
as
he
could
muster
what
were
you
doing
there
fixing
up
a
place
for
the
boat
he
suspected
from
his
appearance
that
he
would
have
to
tell
the
whole
story
benjamin
see
that
you
tell
me
the
truth
and
withhold
nothing
i
wish
to
know
exactly
what
you
did
there
we
built
a
wharf
what
did
you
build
it
with
we
built
it
of
stones
where
did
you
get
your
stones
there
was
a
pile
of
them
close
by
did
they
belong
to
you
no
sir
then
you
stole
them
did
you
it
is
stealing
to
take
stones
why
then
did
you
take
them
in
the
evening
after
the
workmen
had
gone
home
why
did
you
not
go
after
them
when
the
workmen
were
all
there
it
looks
very
much
as
if
you
thought
taking
them
was
stealing
them
benjamin
saw
that
he
was
fairly
cornered
such
a
catechetical
exercise
was
somewhat
new
to
him
the
westminster
assembly
catechism
never
put
him
into
so
tight
a
place
as
that
bright
as
he
was
he
could
not
discover
the
smallest
hole
out
of
which
to
crawl
it
was
a
bad
scrape
and
he
could
see
no
way
out
of
it
except
by
telling
the
truth
we
dislike
very
much
to
say
it
but
judging
from
all
the
circumstances
he
would
have
told
a
lie
could
he
have
seen
a
place
to
put
one
in
but
there
was
no
chance
for
a
falsehood
he
was
completely
shut
up
to
the
truth
he
saw
that
the
wharf
cost
more
than
he
estimated
that
stealing
stones
violated
a
principle
as
really
as
stealing
dollars
he
was
so
completely
cornered
that
he
made
no
reply
his
father
continued
i
see
plainly
how
it
is
it
is
the
consequence
of
going
out
in
the
evening
with
the
boys
which
i
must
hereafter
forbid
i
have
been
willing
that
you
should
go
out
occasionally
in
the
evening
because
i
thought
it
might
be
better
for
you
than
so
much
reading
but
you
have
now
betrayed
my
confidence
and
i
am
more
than
ever
satisfied
that
boys
should
spend
their
evenings
at
home
trying
to
improve
their
minds
you
are
guilty
of
an
act
that
is
quite
flagrant
although
it
may
have
been
done
thoughtlessly
you
should
have
known
better
after
having
received
so
much
instruction
at
home
i
did
know
better
was
benjamin
frank
confession
determined
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
that
makes
your
guilt
so
much
the
greater
will
you
learn
a
lesson
from
this
and
never
do
the
like
again
i
promise
that
i
never
will
thus
frankly
benjamin
confessed
his
and
in
mature
life
he
often
referred
to
it
as
his
wrong
from
which
he
learned
a
lesson
for
life
it
was
another
way
of
too
dear
for
a
what
the
whistle
was
to
him
at
seven
the
wharf
of
stones
was
to
him
at
twelve
years
of
age
sport
the
first
was
innocent
sport
however
the
last
was
guilty
it
appears
that
the
workmen
missed
their
stones
when
they
first
reached
the
spot
in
the
morning
and
soon
discovered
them
nicely
laid
into
a
wharf
the
proprietor
was
indignant
and
set
about
learning
who
were
the
authors
of
the
deed
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
gained
the
information
he
sought
and
very
properly
went
to
the
parents
of
each
boy
with
his
complaint
in
this
way
the
boys
were
exposed
and
received
just
rebuke
for
their
misdemeanor
benjamin
was
convinced
as
he
said
of
it
many
years
thereafter
that
that
which
is
not
honest
could
not
be
truly
useful
viii
becoming
at
the
time
benjamin
was
in
the
his
brother
james
was
in
england
learning
the
printer
trade
he
spent
several
years
there
until
he
had
mastered
the
business
intending
to
return
to
boston
and
establish
that
trade
he
returned
about
the
time
that
benjamin
was
concluding
his
disgust
with
and
was
well
under
way
at
the
time
he
abandoned
the
cutler
trade
james
brought
press
type
and
all
the
of
a
complete
outfit
with
him
from
england
how
would
you
like
to
learn
the
printer
trade
with
your
brother
james
inquired
his
father
a
short
time
after
benjamin
left
the
cutler
shop
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
and
i
really
believe
that
you
have
more
qualifications
for
it
than
you
have
for
any
other
trade
your
love
of
learning
will
have
a
better
chance
there
too
how
is
that
answered
benjamin
i
do
not
quite
see
in
what
respect
i
am
better
qualified
to
be
a
printer
than
a
cutler
well
you
are
a
good
reader
and
have
an
intellectual
turn
being
fond
of
books
and
a
printing
office
must
have
more
opportunities
for
mental
improvement
than
the
shop
of
a
cutler
a
can
be
acquiring
new
and
valuable
ideas
when
he
is
setting
up
written
articles
if
that
is
so
i
should
like
it
well
and
i
should
think
it
might
be
as
you
say
benjamin
answered
i
might
have
a
better
chance
to
read
of
course
you
would
you
may
have
matter
to
put
in
type
that
is
as
interesting
and
profitable
as
any
thing
you
find
in
books
indeed
james
will
no
doubt
have
pamphlets
and
books
to
publish
before
long
all
that
you
read
in
books
went
through
the
printer
hand
first
i
had
not
thought
of
that
said
benjamin
quite
taken
with
his
father
ideas
about
the
printing
business
i
think
i
should
like
it
better
than
almost
any
thing
else
how
long
will
it
take
to
learn
the
trade
i
suppose
that
it
will
take
some
time
though
i
know
very
little
about
it
you
are
twelve
years
of
age
now
and
you
can
certainly
acquire
the
best
knowledge
of
the
trade
by
the
time
you
are
that
is
a
long
time
suggested
benjamin
nine
years
ought
to
make
the
best
printer
there
is
but
that
is
no
objection
to
me
i
shall
do
as
you
think
best
i
want
should
think
it
best
too
rejoined
his
father
if
you
have
no
inclination
to
be
a
printer
i
do
not
want
you
should
undertake
it
you
will
not
succeed
in
any
business
you
dislike
i
do
think
it
best
to
try
this
replied
benjamin
if
james
thinks
well
of
it
i
shall
for
he
knows
all
about
the
trade
i
will
speak
with
him
about
it
and
learn
his
opinion
said
his
father
if
he
thinks
well
of
it
i
will
see
what
arrangements
can
be
made
with
him
the
prospects
of
the
business
are
not
flattering
now
but
i
think
the
day
is
coming
when
it
will
prosper
franklin
lost
no
time
in
conferring
with
james
who
favored
the
plan
without
any
reserve
he
proposed
to
take
benjamin
as
an
apprentice
to
serve
until
he
was
years
old
according
to
the
custom
of
the
times
receiving
twenty
pounds
for
the
same
and
giving
him
board
and
clothes
until
the
last
year
when
he
would
be
paid
journeyman
wages
this
was
a
good
opportunity
on
the
whole
for
printing
was
in
its
infancy
in
our
country
at
that
time
not
more
than
six
or
eight
persons
had
been
in
the
business
in
boston
before
james
franklin
commenced
in
the
year
the
demand
for
printing
must
have
been
very
small
indeed
the
first
printing
press
in
the
united
states
was
set
up
in
cambridge
in
by
rev
jesse
glover
who
gave
it
to
harvard
university
the
first
thing
printed
was
the
freeman
oath
the
next
the
almanac
for
new
england
calculated
by
william
pierce
a
mariner
the
next
a
metrical
version
of
the
psalms
it
is
claimed
that
ten
years
later
than
benjamin
entering
his
brother
printing
office
there
were
but
three
or
four
printers
in
our
country
whether
that
was
so
or
not
it
is
certain
that
then
and
for
many
years
afterwards
printers
were
very
scarce
in
old
style
the
council
of
new
york
adopted
the
following
resolution
it
is
resolved
in
council
that
if
a
printer
will
come
and
settle
in
the
city
of
new
york
for
the
printing
of
our
acts
of
assembly
and
public
papers
he
shall
be
allowed
the
sum
of
forty
pounds
current
money
of
new
york
per
annum
for
his
salary
and
have
the
benefit
of
his
printing
besides
what
serves
to
the
public
it
is
said
also
that
when
benjamin
franklin
wanted
to
marry
the
daughter
of
reed
of
philadelphia
her
mother
said
i
do
not
know
about
giving
my
daughter
to
a
printer
for
there
are
already
four
in
the
united
states
and
it
is
doubtful
if
more
could
get
a
living
it
is
worthy
of
note
here
also
as
showing
how
slowly
the
printing
business
advanced
in
the
infancy
of
our
country
that
great
britain
did
not
allow
the
american
colonies
to
print
the
english
bible
hence
the
first
bible
printed
in
this
country
was
published
in
a
little
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
for
this
reason
most
of
the
pulpit
bibles
in
the
congregational
and
other
churches
of
new
england
before
that
time
were
the
oxford
editions
in
which
the
book
of
common
prayer
and
the
psalms
were
included
and
the
articles
of
faith
of
the
english
church
some
of
these
are
still
preserved
as
relics
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
be
bound
to
your
brother
according
to
law
remarked
franklin
these
things
must
be
done
legally
and
such
is
the
law
and
custom
too
and
i
am
to
board
with
him
also
if
i
understand
you
father
benjamin
was
thinking
of
leaving
his
home
and
that
would
be
a
trial
true
he
would
not
be
far
from
his
father
house
he
could
step
into
it
every
night
if
he
wished
but
it
was
leaving
home
nevertheless
it
does
not
seem
quite
right
for
one
brother
to
be
bound
to
another
for
nine
years
added
benjamin
thoughtfully
and
after
some
hesitation
but
such
is
the
custom
however
it
may
appear
and
it
must
be
done
so
to
have
every
thing
right
and
legal
we
do
not
know
what
may
happen
in
the
nine
years
it
is
better
to
have
things
in
black
and
white
whether
the
bargain
is
with
a
brother
or
any
one
else
franklin
added
more
to
the
last
remarks
in
order
to
remove
an
objection
which
benjamin
seemed
to
have
to
being
bound
to
his
brother
and
he
was
successful
the
last
objection
was
removed
and
cheerfully
and
gladly
benjamin
consented
to
become
a
the
following
was
the
form
of
the
indenture
of
apprenticeship
that
bound
benjamin
to
his
brother
for
nine
years
this
indenture
witnesseth
that
benjamin
franklin
son
of
josiah
franklin
and
of
abiah
his
wife
of
boston
in
the
colony
of
massachusetts
bay
with
the
consent
of
his
parents
doth
put
himself
apprentice
to
his
brother
james
franklin
printer
to
learn
his
art
and
with
him
after
the
manner
of
an
apprentice
from
the
day
of
in
the
year
of
our
lord
until
he
shall
have
fully
completed
the
year
of
his
age
during
which
term
the
said
apprentice
his
master
faithfully
shall
or
will
serve
his
secrets
keep
his
lawful
commands
everywhere
gladly
do
he
shall
do
no
damage
to
his
said
master
nor
see
it
to
be
done
of
others
but
to
his
power
shall
let
or
forthwith
give
notice
to
his
said
master
of
the
same
the
goods
of
his
said
master
he
shall
not
waste
nor
the
same
without
license
of
him
to
any
give
or
lend
hurt
to
his
said
master
he
shall
not

cause
nor
procure

by

in

whereof
the
parties
aforesaid
to
these
indentures
interchangeably
have
set
their
hands
and
seals
this
day
of
in
the
fifth
year
of
our
sovereign
lord
george
the
first
by
the
grace
of
god
of
great
britain
france
and
ireland
king
defender
of
the
faith
and
in
the
year
of
our
lord
to
this
document
benjamin
signed
his
name
with
his
father
and
brother
thereby
having
his
liberty
considerably
abridged
a
boy
by
the
name
of
william
tinsley
took
the
place
of
benjamin
in
franklin
he
was
bound
to
franklin
as
benjamin
was
bound
to
his
brother
but
he
liked
the
business
no
better
than
benjamin
did
and
finally
to
escape
from
his
thraldom
he
ran
away
whereupon
his
master
inserted
the
following
advertisement
in
the
england
of
july
which
reads
very
much
like
advertisements
for
runaway
slaves
in
that
and
later
days
and
probably
young
tinsley
thought
he
was
escaping
from
a
sort
of
white
slavery
ran
away
from
his
master
josiah
franklin
of
boston
on
the
first
of
this
instant
july
an
irish
named
william
tinsley
about
years
of
age
of
a
middle
stature
black
hair
lately
cut
off
somewhat
countenance
a
large
lower
lip
of
a
mean
aspect
large
legs
and
heavy
in
his
going
he
had
on
when
he
went
away
a
felt
hat
a
white
knit
cap
striped
with
red
and
blue
white
shirt
and
a
jacket
almost
new
a
frieze
coat
of
a
dark
colour
grey
yarn
stockings
leather
breeches
trimmed
with
black
and
round
to
shoes
whoever
shall
apprehend
the
said
runaway
servant
and
him
safely
convey
to
his
above
said
master
at
the
blue
ball
in
union
street
boston
shall
have
forty
shillings
reward
and
all
necessary
charges
paid
there
is
no
evidence
that
tinsley
was
ever
found
he
hated
the
so
lustily
that
he
put
the
longest
possible
distance
between
himself
and
it
had
benjamin
been
compelled
to
continue
the
unpleasant
business
he
might
have
escaped
from
the
hardship
in
a
similar
way
these
facts
together
with
the
foregoing
documents
show
that
in
some
respects
many
white
youth
of
that
day
were
subjected
to
an
experience
not
wholly
unlike
that
of
the
colored
youth
often
the
indentured
parties
became
the
victims
of
cruelty
sometimes
they
were
half
clothed
and
fed
sometimes
they
were
beaten
unmercifully
they
were
completely
in
the
hands
of
the
master
and
whether
their
experience
was
pleasant
or
sad
depended
upon
his
temper
add
another
fact
to
the
foregoing
about
the
indenture
of
apprenticeship
and
the
similarity
of
white
to
negro
slavery
in
that
day
is
quite
remarkable
no
longer
than
years
ago
a
poor
child
left
to
the
town
by
the
death
of
the
father
was
put
up
at
auction
and
the
man
who
bid
the
lowest
sum
was
entitled
to
him
the
town
paid
the
amount
to
get
rid
of
the
incumbrance
without
much
regard
to
the
future
treatment
of
the
orphan
a
near
neighbor
of
the
author
years
of
age
was
sold
in
this
manner
three
times
in
his
early
life
suffering
more
and
more
with
each
change
until
he
was
old
enough
to
defend
himself
and
run
away
his
first
buyer
for
some
reason
wanted
to
dispose
of
him
and
he
sold
him
at
auction
to
another
the
second
buyer
was
heartless
and
cruel
against
which
the
boy
rebelled
and
for
this
reason
he
was
sold
to
a
third
master
who
proved
to
be
the
worst
tyrant
of
the
three
subjecting
the
youth
to
all
sorts
of
to
escape
which
he
took
to
his
heels
he
was
not
given
a
day
schooling
by
either
master
nor
one
holiday
nor
the
privilege
of
going
to
meeting
on
the
sabbath
nor
was
he
half
fed
and
clothed
at
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
we
have
turned
aside
from
our
narrative
to
record
a
somewhat
barbaric
custom
of
our
forefathers
that
the
reader
may
appreciate
all
the
more
the
higher
civilization
and
more
congenial
experiences
of
this
age
benjamin
had
become
a
as
fully
equipped
for
duty
as
documents
pledges
and
promises
could
make
him
his
entered
into
this
new
work
and
his
also
the
business
set
him
to
thinking
he
liked
it
indeed
he
could
find
no
fault
with
it
the
business
liked
him
too
that
is
he
had
a
tact
for
it
he
was
adapted
to
it
the
boy
and
the
trade
were
suited
to
each
other
hence
he
became
even
fascinated
with
it
i
like
it
better
than
i
thought
i
should
he
said
to
his
mother
i
have
to
use
my
brains
more
in
putting
a
single
paragraph
into
type
than
i
did
in
filling
a
whole
regiment
of
i
like
it
better
and
better
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
though
i
rather
expected
as
much
if
you
like
it
as
well
as
james
does
you
will
like
it
well
enough
he
is
thoroughly
satisfied
with
his
trade
and
i
think
he
will
find
it
to
be
a
profitable
one
by
and
by
in
a
new
country
it
takes
time
to
build
up
almost
any
trade
franklin
spoke
from
a
full
heart
for
she
had
great
interest
in
benjamin
chosen
pursuit
because
she
believed
that
he
possessed
remarkable
talents
she
still
expected
that
he
would
make
his
mark
though
prevented
from
entering
the
ministry
i
get
some
time
to
read
continued
benjamin
and
i
mean
to
get
more
though
there
is
much
confusion
at
my
you
must
not
gain
time
for
reading
at
the
expense
of
neglecting
your
work
suggested
his
mother
your
time
is
your
brother
and
first
of
all
you
must
fulfill
your
obligations
to
him
fidelity
is
a
cardinal
virtue
remember
of
course
replied
benjamin
i
know
what
i
am
in
duty
bound
to
do
and
i
shall
do
it
james
has
not
found
me
a
minute
behind
time
yet
nor
lazy
in
the
printing
office
and
i
mean
that
he
never
shall
that
is
a
good
resolution
very
good
indeed
and
i
hope
you
will
keep
it
at
the
same
time
do
not
neglect
your
bible
nor
cease
to
attend
public
worship
on
the
sabbath
a
boy
ca
get
along
without
these
any
more
than
his
parents
can
as
soon
as
you
begin
to
neglect
these
you
are
exposed
to
danger
and
the
very
worst
sort
of
danger
to
those
who
are
determined
to
succeed
time
can
be
found
for
reading
without
interfering
with
business
budgett
the
rich
english
merchant
was
a
great
reader
he
would
not
allow
his
time
for
reading
to
interfere
with
his
business
nor
his
time
for
business
to
interfere
with
his
reading
he
prepared
a
by
which
his
work
was
regulated
each
day
from
an
examination
of
it
we
learn
the
number
of
hours
and
pages
he
read
the
first
two
weeks
of
january
he
spent
hours
in
his
library
and
read
pages
of
josephus
history
hundred
and
pages
of
milner
church
history
hundred
and
pages
of
baxter
saints
rest
and
spent
a
fair
proportion
of
the
time
in
studying
townsend
old
and
new
testaments
such
is
what
the
busiest
man
can
do
when
he
regulates
his
time
for
it
james
franklin
printing
office
where
benjamin
worked
was
at
the
corner
of
franklin
avenue
and
court
street
as
his
brother
was
unmarried
he
boarded
at
a
place
near
by
which
james
secured
probably
the
large
family
and
want
of
room
were
the
reason
he
did
not
continue
to
board
at
his
father
the
family
were
always
in
a
strait
for
room
a
vacancy
only
left
room
which
the
remaining
members
sorely
needed
and
they
occupied
it
so
readily
and
naturally
that
the
former
occupant
was
scarcely
missed
the
printer
trade
embraced
some
kinds
of
work
at
that
time
which
it
does
not
embrace
now
as
we
judge
from
the
advertisement
of
james
franklin
in
the
when
he
commenced
business
as
follows
the
printer
hereof
prints
linens
calicoes
silks
in
good
figures
very
lively
and
durable
colors
and
without
the
offensive
smell
which
commonly
attends
the
linens
printed
here
such
printing
was
done
for
ladies
who
were
in
need
of
what
there
was
no
manufactory
to
supply
at
that
time
when
benjamin
had
served
two
years
at
his
trade
he
had
become
indispensable
to
his
brother
he
had
devoted
himself
to
his
work
with
all
his
heart
and
had
made
rapid
improvement
he
had
acquired
a
good
understanding
of
the
trade
he
was
a
superior
compositor
his
judgment
was
excellent
he
was
industrious
there
was
not
a
lazy
bone
in
him
and
he
was
punctual
the
habit
of
reading
that
benjamin
had
formed
tended
to
make
him
punctual
in
order
to
command
the
more
time
he
was
promptly
at
his
work
and
efficiently
discharged
every
duty
it
was
this
habit
of
punctuality
that
made
him
so
reliable
in
the
printing
office
his
brother
knew
that
he
would
be
there
at
such
a
time
and
that
he
would
remain
just
so
many
hours
this
habit
won
his
confidence
as
it
does
the
confidence
of
every
one
there
is
no
quality
that
does
more
to
gain
a
good
name
for
an
individual
and
inspire
the
confidence
of
his
than
this
one
of
being
on
time
it
is
so
generally
found
in
company
with
other
excellent
traits
of
character
that
it
seems
to
be
taken
for
granted
usually
that
the
punctual
person
is
worthy
in
other
respects
a
ripe
scholar
was
the
neighbor
of
adam
clarke
the
commentator
when
the
latter
had
become
quite
renowned
on
the
same
evening
both
saw
a
copy
of
the
greek
testament
by
erasmus
advertised
as
soon
as
the
ripe
scholar
had
swallowed
his
breakfast
on
the
next
morning
he
hastened
to
the
to
purchase
the
volume
you
are
too
late
the
book
is
sold
replied
the
to
the
inquiry
of
the
gentleman
too
late
exclaimed
the
scholar
why
i
came
as
soon
as
i
had
eaten
my
breakfast
yes
but
adam
clarke
came
responded
the
merchant
the
incident
shows
that
the
man
who
is
on
time
has
the
inside
track
and
the
inside
track
is
nearest
the
goal
it
is
the
man
who
is
prompt
not
the
dull
sleepy
procrastinator
the
best
qualities
of
manhood
must
be
on
the
alert
to
secure
promptness
the
poorest
qualities
will
secure
the
opposite
the
prize
is
taken
by
the
worker
who
is
it
is
lost
by
him
who
is
as
the
aforesaid
scholar
was
he
planned
to
make
sure
of
his
breakfast
before
he
did
of
the
book
but
adam
clarke
made
sure
of
the
book
before
he
did
of
his
breakfast
and
he
won
in
washington
visited
boston
and
he
decided
to
leave
for
salem
on
the
morning
of
a
certain
day
at
eight
precisely
a
company
of
cavalry
volunteered
to
escort
him
to
salem
while
the
clock
of
the
old
south
church
was
striking
eight
washington
mounted
his
horse
and
started
though
his
escort
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
a
few
minutes
later
however
they
arrived
and
were
greatly
mortified
to
find
that
washington
had
gone
putting
spurs
to
their
horses
they
galloped
forward
and
overtook
him
at
charles
river
bridge
when
they
came
up
washington
said
major
i
thought
you
had
been
in
my
family
too
long
not
to
know
when
it
was
eight
the
habit
of
punctuality
which
franklin
formed
in
his
youth
distinguished
him
in
his
manhood
as
much
as
the
same
habit
did
washington
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
exerted
a
large
influence
in
placing
him
next
to
washington
among
the
founders
of
our
republic
one
of
the
maxims
that
he
wrote
in
mature
life
was
he
that
riseth
late
must
trot
all
day
and
shall
scarce
overtake
his
business
at
night
ix
education
we
delay
the
narrative
at
this
point
to
introduce
a
subject
that
franklin
often
referred
to
as
influencing
his
early
life
in
his
autobiography
he
said
at
his
table
he
his
father
liked
to
have
as
often
as
he
could
some
sensible
friend
or
neighbor
to
converse
with
and
always
took
care
to
start
some
ingenious
or
useful
topic
for
discourse
which
might
tend
to
improve
the
minds
of
his
children
by
this
means
he
turned
our
attention
to
what
was
good
just
and
prudent
in
the
conduct
of
life
and
little
or
no
notice
was
ever
taken
of
what
related
to
the
victuals
on
the
table
whether
it
was
well
or
ill
dressed
in
or
out
of
season
of
good
or
bad
flavor
preferable
or
inferior
to
this
or
that
other
thing
of
the
kind
so
that
i
was
brought
up
in
such
a
perfect
inattention
to
those
matters
as
to
be
quite
indifferent
what
kind
of
food
was
set
before
me
indeed
i
am
so
unobservant
of
it
that
to
this
day
i
can
scarce
tell
a
few
hours
after
dinner
of
what
dishes
it
consisted
this
has
been
a
great
convenience
to
me
in
travelling
where
my
companions
have
been
sometimes
very
unhappy
for
want
of
a
suitable
gratification
of
their
more
delicate
because
better
instructed
tastes
and
appetites
this
was
different
from
much
of
the
that
is
heard
in
many
families
now
i
do
not
want
any
of
that
i
do
not
love
it
exclaims
one
child
i
should
think
you
might
have
a
better
dinner
than
this
what
would
you
have
if
you
could
get
it
roast
chicken
and
plum
pudding
his
mother
replies
in
a
facetious
way
instead
of
reproving
him
i
would
have
something
i
could
eat
you
know
i
do
not
love
that
and
never
did
well
it
does
boys
good
sometimes
to
eat
what
they
do
not
love
especially
such
particular
ones
as
you
are
adds
his
father
i
eat
what
i
do
not
like
anyhow
i
shall
go
hungry
first
there
now
let
me
hear
no
more
complaint
about
your
food
adds
his
father
more
sharply
you
are
scarcely
ever
suited
with
your
victuals
may
i
have
some
calling
for
something
that
is
not
on
the
table
if
you
will
hold
your
tongue
and
get
it
yourself
you
can
have
it
and
let
me
have
some
too
shouts
another
child
i
do
not
love
this
neither
may
i
have
some
pa
and
i
too
exclaims
still
another
i
must
have
some
if
henry
and
james
do
in
this
way
the
proceeds
until
fretting
scolding
crying
make
up
the
sum
total
of
the
conversation
and
family
joy
are
embittered
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
contrast
with
the
discipline
of
instructive
conversation
such
schooling
at
the
fireside
is
pitiable
indeed
franklin
claimed
that
this
feature
of
family
government
exerted
a
moulding
influence
upon
his
life
and
character
it
caused
him
to
value
profitable
conversation
in
boyhood
and
youth
in
manhood
he
frequently
found
himself
posted
upon
subjects
made
familiar
to
him
by
conversation
at
the
table
and
hearthstone
of
his
boyhood
especially
topics
relating
to
the
mother
country
he
was
more
particularly
edified
by
conversation
at
home
during
the
four
years
that
uncle
benjamin
was
a
member
of
his
father
family
for
this
favorite
uncle
was
a
very
instructive
talker
having
been
educated
by
the
conversation
of
his
father
at
home
in
england
as
his
nephew
benjamin
was
by
his
father
in
boston
when
uncle
benjamin
was
very
old
he
could
even
recall
the
expressions
which
his
father
used
in
prayer
at
the
family
altar
and
he
wrote
some
of
them
in
one
of
his
books
of
poetry
as
follows
holy
father
into
thy
hand
we
commit
our
spirits
for
thou
hast
redeemed
them
o
lord
god
of
truth
command
thine
angel
to
encamp
round
about
our
habitation
give
thine
angels
charge
over
us
that
no
evil
may
come
nigh
our
dwelling
thou
knowest
our
and
thou
art
acquainted
with
all
our
ways
and
knowest
our
afar
off
we
know
that
in
us
that
is
in
our
flesh
there
dwelleth
no
good
thing
holy
father
keep
through
thine
own
name
all
those
that
are
thine
that
none
of
them
be
lost
we
thank
thee
o
father
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
tho
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
yet
thou
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes
even
so
holy
father
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight
we
have
copied
the
language
just
as
it
was
written
by
uncle
benjamin
and
it
is
chiefly
bible
language
showing
marked
familiarity
with
the
scriptures
we
infer
from
the
foregoing
that
useful
conversation
was
characteristic
of
the
franklins
of
each
generation
indicating
a
good
degree
of
intelligence
and
talents
of
high
order
ignorance
does
not
indulge
in
improving
conversation
it
could
not
if
it
would
nor
do
small
mental
powers
show
themselves
in
excellence
of
conversation
so
that
it
is
quite
evident
that
talents
in
the
josiah
franklin
family
were
not
limited
to
benjamin
they
reached
back
to
former
generations
parton
says
thomas
franklin
the
elder
had
four
sons
thomas
john
benjamin
and
josiah
there
lived
at
ecton
during
the
boyhood
of
these
four
sons
a
john
palmer
the
squire
of
the
parish
and
lord
of
an
adjacent
manor
who
attracted
by
their
intelligence
and
spirit
lent
them
books
assisted
them
to
lessons
in
drawing
and
music
and
in
various
ways
encouraged
them
to
improve
their
minds
all
the
boys
appear
to
have
been
greatly
profited
by
squire
friendly
aid
but
none
of
them
so
much
as
thomas
the
eldest
inheritor
of
the
family
forge
and
farm
it
was
this
thomas
who
became
grandfather
of
our
benjamin
and
whose
expressions
in
prayer
we
have
quoted
parton
discovers
such
talents
there
as
make
profitable
conversation
at
the
table
and
elsewhere
and
are
transmitted
to
posterity
for
he
says
still
further
in
families
destined
at
length
to
give
birth
to
an
illustrious
individual
nature
seems
sometimes
to
make
an
essay
of
her
powers
with
that
material
before
producing
the
consummate
specimen
there
was
a
remarkable
pitt
before
lord
chatham
there
was
an
extraordinary
fox
before
the
day
of
the
ablest
debater
in
europe
there
was
a
witty
sheridan
before
richard
brinsley
there
was
a
mirabeau
before
the
mirabeau
of
the
french
revolution
and
to
cite
a
higher
instance
shakespeare
father
was
at
least
extraordinarily
fond
of
dramatic
entertainments
if
we
may
infer
any
thing
certain
from
the
brief
records
of
his
mayoralty
of
stratford
for
he
appears
to
have
given
the
players
the
kind
of
welcome
that
hamlet
admonished
polonius
to
bestow
upon
them
thomas
franklin
the
eldest
uncle
of
our
benjamin
learned
the
blacksmith
trade
in
his
father
shop
but
aided
by
squire
palmer
and
his
own
natural
aptitude
for
affairs
became
as
his
nephew
tells
us
conveyancer
something
of
a
lawyer
clerk
of
the
county
court
and
clerk
to
the
archdeacon
a
very
leading
man
in
all
county
affairs
and
much
employed
in
public
business
the
quotation
parton
makes
in
his
closing
lines
is
from
a
letter
of
benjamin
franklin
addressed
to
deborah
franklin
dated
london
september
we
quote
still
further
from
it
as
it
is
interesting
matter
relating
to
the
prominence
and
intelligence
of
the
franklin
ancestors
from
wellingborough
we
went
to
ecton
about
three
or
four
miles
being
the
village
where
my
father
was
born
and
where
his
father
grandfather
and
had
lived
and
how
many
of
the
family
before
them
we
know
not
we
went
first
to
see
the
old
house
and
grounds
they
came
to
fisher
with
his
wife
and
after
letting
them
for
some
years
finding
his
rent
something
he
sold
them
the
land
is
now
added
to
another
farm
and
a
school
is
kept
in
the
house
it
is
a
decayed
old
stone
building
but
still
known
by
the
name
of
franklin
house
thence
we
went
to
visit
the
rector
of
the
parish
who
lives
close
by
the
church
a
very
ancient
building
he
entertained
us
very
kindly
and
showed
us
the
old
church
register
in
which
were
the
births
marriages
and
burials
of
our
ancestors
for
two
hundred
years
as
early
as
his
book
began
his
wife
a
chatty
old
lady
granddaughter
of
the
famous
archdeacon
palmer
who
formerly
had
that
parish
and
lived
there
remembered
a
great
deal
about
the
family
carried
us
out
into
the
and
showed
us
several
of
their
which
were
so
covered
with
moss
that
we
could
not
read
the
letters
till
she
ordered
a
hard
brush
and
a
basin
of
water
with
which
peter
scoured
them
clean
and
then
billy
copied
them
she
entertained
and
diverted
us
highly
with
stories
of
thomas
franklin
fisher
father
who
was
a
conveyancer
something
of
a
lawyer
clerk
of
the
county
courts
and
clerk
to
the
archdeacon
in
his
visitations
a
very
leading
man
in
all
county
affairs
and
much
employed
in
public
business
he
set
on
foot
a
subscription
for
erecting
chimes
in
their
steeple
and
completed
it
and
we
heard
them
play
he
found
out
an
easy
method
of
saving
their
village
meadows
from
being
drowned
as
they
used
to
be
sometimes
by
the
river
which
method
is
still
in
being
but
when
first
proposed
nobody
could
conceive
how
it
could
be
however
they
said
franklin
says
he
knows
how
to
do
it
it
will
be
done
his
advice
and
opinion
were
sought
for
on
all
occasions
by
all
sorts
of
people
and
he
was
looked
upon
she
said
by
some
as
something
of
a
conjurer
he
died
just
four
years
before
i
was
born
on
the
same
day
of
the
same
month
such
kind
of
men
are
not
given
to
foolish
conversation
they
are
too
sensible
to
indulge
in
mere
twaddle
about
the
weather
their
talents
raise
them
to
a
higher
plane
of
thought
and
remark
josiah
franklin
only
observed
the
custom
of
his
ancestors
no
doubt
unwittingly
when
he
sought
to
improve
the
minds
and
hearts
of
his
children
by
instructive
conversation
at
the
table
and
fireside
benjamin
had
a
right
to
claim
for
it
a
decided
educational
influence
in
the
family
pythagoras
set
so
great
value
upon
useful
conversation
that
he
commanded
his
disciples
to
maintain
silence
during
the
first
two
years
of
their
instruction
he
would
have
their
minds
thoroughly
furnished
that
their
conversation
might
be
worthy
of
the
pupils
of
so
illustrious
a
teacher
he
was
wont
to
say
be
silent
or
say
something
better
than
silence
no
men
ever
put
this
wise
counsel
into
practice
more
thoroughly
than
josiah
franklin
and
his
son
benjamin
cicero
said
of
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
we
have
read
the
letters
of
cornelia
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
from
which
it
appears
that
the
sons
were
educated
not
so
much
in
the
lap
of
the
mother
as
by
her
josiah
franklin
had
as
poor
an
opinion
of
the
as
an
educator
of
his
sons
in
comparison
with
as
cornelia
had
the
poet
cowper
wrote
though
conversation
in
its
better
part
may
be
esteemed
a
gift
and
not
an
art
yet
much
depends
as
in
the
tiller
toil
on
culture
and
the
sowing
of
the
soil
josiah
franklin
was
enough
of
a
poet
to
understand
this
and
reduce
it
to
practice
as
his
son
said
he
delighted
to
have
some
intelligent
man
or
woman
for
a
guest
at
his
table
for
the
improvement
of
his
children
but
when
there
was
no
guest
at
the
table
he
led
the
way
alone
by
calling
the
attention
of
his
sons
and
daughters
to
some
subject
of
interest
and
profit
he
thought
it
would
divert
their
attention
from
the
quality
of
their
food
so
that
they
would
not
be
so
apt
to
complain
of
it
and
at
the
same
time
impart
information
and
set
them
thinking
he
did
not
allow
one
of
his
children
to
complain
of
the
food
on
the
table
and
he
would
have
prevented
it
by
severe
measures
if
necessary
before
he
found
the
method
cited
a
wise
one
and
therefore
persevered
in
it
he
often
made
this
remark
you
must
give
heed
to
little
things
although
nothing
can
be
considered
small
that
is
important
it
is
of
far
more
consequence
how
you
behave
than
what
you
eat
and
wear
another
remark
he
would
make
when
the
meal
was
unusually
plain
was
this
many
people
are
too
particular
about
their
victuals
they
destroy
their
health
by
eating
too
much
and
too
rich
food
plain
simple
wholesome
fare
is
all
that
nature
requires
and
young
persons
who
are
brought
up
in
this
way
will
be
best
off
in
the
end
here
is
found
the
origin
of
benjamin
rigid
temperance
principles
in
eating
and
drinking
for
which
he
was
distinguished
through
life
in
his
manhood
he
wrote
and
talked
upon
the
subject
and
reduced
his
principles
to
practice
there
scarcely
ever
lived
a
man
who
was
so
indifferent
as
to
what
he
ate
and
drank
as
he
was
when
he
worked
in
a
in
england
his
were
hard
drinkers
of
strong
beer
really
believing
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
them
strength
to
endure
they
were
astonished
to
see
a
youth
like
benjamin
able
to
excel
the
smartest
of
them
in
the
printing
office
while
he
drank
only
cold
water
and
they
sneeringly
called
him
the
water
american
the
temperate
habits
which
benjamin
formed
in
his
youth
were
the
more
remarkable
because
there
were
no
temperance
societies
at
that
time
and
it
was
generally
supposed
to
be
necessary
to
use
intoxicating
drinks
the
evils
of
intemperance
were
not
viewed
with
so
much
abhorrence
as
they
are
now
and
the
project
of
removing
them
from
society
was
not
entertained
for
a
moment
reformatory
movements
of
this
kind
did
not
begin
until
nearly
a
century
after
the
time
referred
to
yet
benjamin
was
fully
persuaded
in
his
youth
that
he
ought
to
be
temperate
in
all
things
it
was
a
theme
of
conversation
at
his
father
table
and
fireside
that
conversation
instructed
him
then
as
temperance
lectures
books
and
societies
instruct
the
young
now
and
it
accomplished
its
purpose
in
the
sequel
we
shall
learn
still
more
of
the
moulding
power
of
home
lessons
in
conversation
to
make
him
the
man
he
became
it
is
related
of
the
washburne
family
so
well
known
in
the
public
affairs
of
our
country
four
or
five
brothers
having
occupied
posts
of
political
distinction
that
in
their
early
life
their
father
house
was
open
to
ministers
and
was
sometimes
called
the
hotel
washburne
was
a
great
friend
of
this
class
and
enjoyed
their
society
much
nearly
all
the
time
some
one
of
the
ministerial
fraternity
would
be
stopping
there
his
sons
were
thus
brought
into
their
society
and
they
listened
to
long
discussions
upon
subjects
of
a
scientific
political
and
religious
character
though
public
measures
received
a
large
share
of
attention
the
boys
acquired
valuable
information
by
listening
to
their
remarks
and
this
created
a
desire
to
read
and
learn
more
and
so
they
were
started
off
in
a
career
that
led
them
on
to
fame
their
early
advantages
were
few
but
the
conversation
of
educated
gentlemen
upon
important
subjects
laid
the
foundation
of
their
eminence
in
public
life
benjamin
was
young
and
his
heart
easily
impressed
when
he
listened
to
profitable
conversation
in
the
home
of
his
boyhood
the
way
the
twig
is
bent
the
tree
is
inclined
his
father
gave
the
twig
the
right
bent
and
the
tree
was
comely
and
fruitful
it
was
a
very
easy
and
cheap
mode
of
instruction
always
at
hand
needing
neither
nor
blackboard
yet
pleasant
and
uplifting
x
leader
of
sports
and
thought
it
is
unusual
that
the
same
boy
should
be
a
leader
in
nearly
all
innocent
sports
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
thoughtful
and
studious
boy
of
all
generally
the
youth
is
an
indifferent
scholar
having
little
taste
for
reading
and
study
but
it
was
otherwise
with
benjamin
he
was
as
much
of
an
expert
in
sport
as
he
was
in
reading
the
best
jumper
runner
swimmer
and
rower
of
his
age
in
boston
and
he
enjoyed
it
too
perhaps
he
enjoyed
being
the
best
more
than
any
part
of
the
sport
certainly
when
he
was
in
school
he
enjoyed
being
the
scholar
more
than
any
part
of
a
pupil
experience
and
he
so
managed
to
continue
the
best
to
the
end
though
the
end
came
much
too
soon
for
him
swimming
was
his
favorite
sport
it
was
claimed
for
him
that
any
time
between
twelve
and
sixteen
years
of
age
he
could
have
swam
across
the
hellespont
here
as
well
as
elsewhere
his
inventive
genius
was
devising
ways
to
promote
more
rapid
swimming
i
believe
that
i
can
double
my
speed
in
swimming
by
an
invention
i
have
in
mind
he
said
to
john
collins
one
day
what
sort
of
an
invention
you
are
always
up
to
something
of
that
sort
i
think
that
arms
and
legs
are
all
the
invention
that
will
ever
promote
swimming
slow
or
fast
well
you
see
john
if
i
do
not
invent
something
to
greatly
increase
speed
in
swimming
continued
benjamin
i
have
been
studying
on
it
for
some
time
and
i
think
i
have
it
you
do
not
need
anything
to
increase
your
speed
ben
you
can
beat
everybody
now
and
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
that
i
am
not
satisfied
i
want
to
do
better
yet
i
never
did
so
well
in
anything
yet
that
i
did
not
want
to
do
better
right
here
was
really
the
secret
of
benjamin
success
trying
to
do
better
than
not
satisfied
with
present
attainments
pressing
forward
to
something
more
desirable
going
up
higher
such
boys
and
girls
succeed
difficulties
do
not
alarm
or
discourage
them
they
serve
to
draw
them
out
and
make
them
more
invincible
but
youth
who
are
satisfied
to
be
just
what
they
are
no
larger
broader
or
better
live
and
die
mere
ciphers
they
are
destitute
of
ambition
and
the
spirit
of
enterprise
they
have
no
just
conception
of
their
mission
in
this
world
they
do
not
understand
themselves
what
they
are
for
and
what
they
can
be
if
they
choose
what
is
worse
they
have
no
desire
to
know
these
things
the
effort
to
know
them
is
too
much
for
their
easy
indifferent
natures
i
guess
that
is
so
replied
john
to
benjamin
last
remark
i
never
saw
a
boy
just
like
you
and
i
think
you
are
right
i
want
to
know
more
than
i
do
about
many
things
and
i
mean
to
but
what
sort
of
a
swimming
apparatus
have
you
in
mind
well
a
sort
of
palette
for
the
hands
and
sandals
for
the
feet
fastened
tightly
so
as
to
be
used
readily
i
have
an
idea
that
i
can
throw
myself
forward
with
far
greater
speed
i
will
wait
to
see
it
before
i
pass
judgment
on
it
answered
john
it
is
risking
more
than
i
want
to
risk
to
say
you
ca
do
it
for
there
is
no
telling
what
you
can
do
you
will
see
it
in
a
few
days
it
will
not
take
long
to
make
it
i
will
notify
you
when
it
is
ready
and
we
will
try
it
in
the
mean
time
keep
it
a
secret
and
we
will
astonish
the
boys
within
a
few
days
john
collins
was
notified
that
the
swimming
apparatus
was
ready
and
would
be
tried
at
a
certain
time
appointed
other
boys
were
invited
to
meet
at
the
pond
at
the
same
time
benjamin
appeared
on
the
scene
with
two
oval
palettes
of
wood
resembling
those
used
by
painters
ten
inches
long
and
six
broad
a
hole
was
cut
in
each
for
the
thumb
so
that
they
could
be
bound
to
the
palms
of
the
hands
a
kind
of
sandal
shaped
somewhat
like
the
palettes
was
fastened
tightly
to
each
foot
when
rigged
for
a
swim
benjamin
presented
a
very
singular
appearance
and
the
boys
looked
on
astonished
that
is
all
over
ben
exclaimed
fred
no
one
in
creation
except
you
would
ever
have
thought
of
such
an
apparatus
but
i
would
wish
myself
in
the
water
with
such
a
rig
you
are
a
sort
of
skipper
on
legs
now
i
do
not
expect
to
skip
much
on
the
water
but
i
expect
to
swim
much
faster
with
this
device
than
would
be
possible
without
it
replied
benjamin
it
is
different
from
what
i
thought
it
was
from
your
description
said
john
collins
who
had
been
looking
on
with
particular
interest
it
looks
as
if
you
might
do
something
with
it
go
ahead
ben
sink
or
swim
spread
your
sails
and
prove
that
your
ingenuity
is
genuine
benjamin
plunged
into
the
water
and
a
more
interested
and
excited
company
did
not
watch
robert
fulton
when
he
started
up
hudson
river
with
his
new
steamer
eighty
years
later
than
watched
him
with
his
new
mode
of
swimming
he
struck
right
out
into
deep
water
easily
and
moved
forward
much
more
rapidly
than
he
ever
did
before
the
cheers
and
shouts
of
the
boys
making
the
welkin
ring
taking
a
circuit
around
the
pond
for
a
fair
trial
the
boys
had
a
good
opportunity
to
watch
every
movement
and
to
judge
of
the
practicability
of
such
an
invention
that
is
wonderful
exclaimed
one
as
he
came
around
to
the
shore
where
they
stood
you
are
a
genius
ben
shouted
another
capital
added
john
collins
king
george
ought
to
make
a
duke
of
you
but
does
it
work
easy
not
so
easily
as
i
expected
answered
benjamin
the
apparatus
is
hard
on
the
wrists
and
makes
them
ache
the
sandals
on
the
feet
do
not
help
much
i
think
i
could
swim
just
as
well
without
them
then
you
do
not
consider
it
a
complete
success
said
john
inquiringly
not
entirely
so
i
can
swim
very
much
faster
with
it
but
it
is
harder
work
and
the
wrists
will
not
hold
out
long
i
do
not
think
i
shall
apply
to
king
george
for
a
patent
the
swimming
invention
was
pretty
thoroughly
discussed
by
the
boys
one
and
another
suggesting
improvements
benjamin
evidently
satisfied
that
swimming
at
less
speed
in
the
usual
way
was
preferable
to
these
artificial
paddles
and
increased
rapidity
but
their
interest
was
awakened
anew
when
benjamin
informed
them
that
he
had
another
invention
that
he
proposed
to
try
at
a
future
day
what
is
it
inquired
two
or
three
at
the
same
time
you
shall
see
it
is
more
simple
than
this
apparatus
replied
benjamin
it
will
not
be
so
tiresome
to
use
when
will
you
let
us
see
it
on
trial
asked
john
collins
who
perhaps
appreciated
benjamin
spirit
and
talents
more
than
any
of
the
boys
any
time
you
will
all
agree
to
be
here
you
will
not
know
what
it
is
until
you
see
it
the
time
was
appointed
for
the
trial
of
the
unknown
device
and
the
boys
separated
with
their
curiosity
on
tiptoe
as
to
the
nature
of
the
other
improved
method
of
swimming
they
had
no
idea
that
it
was
a
humbug
for
ben
never
practised
sham
he
was
so
much
of
a
genius
that
no
doubt
he
had
something
that
would
surprise
them
john
collins
was
more
like
benjamin
than
other
boys
in
boston
and
he
was
his
most
intimate
companion
john
was
talented
and
a
great
reader
he
had
a
craving
thirst
for
knowledge
and
used
his
leisure
moments
to
improve
his
mind
he
frequently
discussed
profitable
subjects
with
benjamin
who
enjoyed
his
company
very
much
for
this
reason
in
their
tastes
love
of
books
and
high
aims
they
were
suited
to
each
other
benjamin
thought
as
highly
of
john
as
john
did
of
benjamin
when
the
time
for
trying
the
other
device
arrived
benjamin
appeared
on
the
scene
with
a
new
kite
a
kite
exclaimed
john
collins
in
surprise
i
see
it
now
that
simple
he
saw
at
once
that
benjamin
was
going
to
make
a
sail
of
his
kite
and
cross
the
pond
will
hinder
more
than
it
will
help
i
think
remarked
one
of
the
boys
we
shall
know
whether
it
will
or
not
very
soon
responded
another
ben
is
hindered
very
often
while
this
parleying
was
going
on
benjamin
was
disrobing
and
getting
ready
for
the
trial
fred
you
carry
my
clothes
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
pond
and
i
will
swim
across
said
benjamin
as
he
sent
his
kite
up
into
the
air
all
right
answered
fred
i
will
do
it
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
i
will
be
there
to
see
you
land
so
saying
he
caught
up
the
clothes
and
started
off
upon
the
run
the
kite
was
high
up
in
the
air
when
holding
the
string
with
both
hands
benjamin
dropped
into
the
water
upon
his
back
and
at
once
began
to
skim
the
surface
without
an
effort
on
his
part
not
so
much
as
the
moving
of
a
muscle
the
sailing
kite
pulled
him
along
faster
than
his
arms
and
feet
could
have
done
in
the
old
way
of
swimming
that
is
better
than
the
paddles
and
sandals
shouted
john
collins
who
was
intensely
interested
in
the
simplicity
of
the
method
ben
is
only
a
ship
now
and
the
kite
is
his
sail
nobody
but
him
would
ever
thought
of
such
a
thing
not
much
skill
in
that
way
of
swimming
suggested
another
youth
nor
much
fatigue
either
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
on
breathing
and
swim
and
hold
on
to
the
kite
added
another
he
must
not
let
go
of
his
sail
he
and
his
kite
must
be
close
friends
the
boys
kept
up
their
watch
and
conversation
while
benjamin
crossed
the
pond
which
he
accomplished
in
a
few
minutes
dressing
himself
while
fred
drew
in
his
kite
he
hastened
to
join
his
companions
and
receive
their
congratulations
the
boys
were
extravagant
in
their
expressions
of
delight
and
some
of
them
predicted
that
so
cute
a
mode
of
swimming
would
become
universal
while
others
thought
that
the
lack
of
skill
in
the
method
would
lead
many
to
discard
it
benjamin
said
the
motion
is
very
pleasant
indeed
and
i
could
swim
all
day
without
becoming
fatigued
but
there
is
no
skill
in
it
as
you
say
benjamin
expressed
no
opinion
as
to
the
adoption
of
the
method
by
others
and
the
boys
separated
to
tell
the
story
of
exploits
on
the
water
over
town
many
years
afterwards
when
benjamin
was
a
public
man
famous
in
his
own
country
and
europe
he
wrote
to
a
frenchman
by
the
name
of
dubourg
of
both
of
these
experiments
as
follows
when
i
was
a
boy
i
made
two
oval
palettes
each
about
ten
inches
long
and
six
broad
with
a
hole
for
the
thumb
in
order
to
retain
it
fast
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
they
much
resembled
a
painter
palettes
in
swimming
i
pushed
the
edges
of
these
forward
and
i
struck
the
water
with
their
flat
surfaces
as
i
drew
them
back
i
remember
i
swam
faster
by
means
of
these
palettes
but
they
fatigued
my
wrists
i
also
fitted
to
the
soles
of
my
feet
a
kind
of
sandals
but
i
was
not
satisfied
with
them
because
i
observed
that
the
stroke
is
partly
given
by
the
inside
of
the
feet
and
the
ankles
and
not
entirely
with
the
soles
of
the
feet
you
will
not
be
displeased
if
i
conclude
these
hasty
remarks
by
informing
you
that
as
the
ordinary
method
of
swimming
is
reduced
to
the
act
of
rowing
with
the
arms
and
legs
and
is
consequently
a
laborious
and
fatiguing
operation
when
the
space
of
water
to
be
crossed
is
considerable
there
is
a
method
in
which
a
swimmer
may
pass
to
great
distances
with
much
facility
by
means
of
a
sail
this
discovery
i
fortunately
made
by
accident
and
in
the
following
manner
when
i
was
a
boy
i
amused
myself
one
day
with
flying
a
paper
kite
and
approaching
the
bank
of
a
pond
which
was
nearly
a
mile
broad
i
tied
the
string
to
a
stake
and
the
kite
ascended
to
a
very
considerable
height
above
the
pond
while
i
was
swimming
in
a
little
time
being
desirous
of
amusing
myself
with
my
kite
and
enjoying
at
the
same
time
the
pleasure
of
swimming
i
returned
and
loosing
from
the
stake
the
string
with
the
little
stick
which
was
fastened
to
it
went
again
into
the
water
where
i
found
that
lying
on
my
back
and
holding
the
stick
in
my
hands
i
was
drawn
along
the
surface
of
the
water
in
a
very
agreeable
manner
having
then
engaged
another
boy
to
carry
my
clothes
around
the
pond
to
a
place
which
i
pointed
out
to
him
on
the
other
side
i
began
to
cross
the
pond
with
my
kite
which
carried
me
quite
over
without
the
least
fatigue
and
with
the
greatest
pleasure
imaginable
i
was
only
obliged
occasionally
to
halt
a
little
in
my
course
and
resist
its
progress
when
it
appeared
that
by
following
too
quick
i
lowered
the
kite
too
much
by
doing
which
occasionally
i
made
it
rise
again
i
have
never
since
that
time
practised
this
singular
mode
of
swimming
though
i
think
it
not
impossible
to
cross
in
this
manner
from
dover
to
calais
the
however
is
still
preferable
doctor
franklin
wrote
another
long
letter
to
a
man
in
mature
life
advising
him
to
learn
to
swim
the
man
was
not
inclined
to
do
it
on
account
of
his
age
whereupon
doctor
franklin
wrote
i
can
not
be
of
opinion
with
you
that
it
is
too
late
in
life
for
you
to
learn
to
swim
the
river
near
the
bottom
of
your
garden
affords
a
most
convenient
place
for
the
purpose
and
as
your
new
employment
requires
your
being
often
on
the
water
of
which
you
have
such
a
dread
i
think
you
would
do
well
to
make
the
trial
nothing
being
so
likely
to
remove
those
apprehensions
as
the
consciousness
of
an
ability
to
swim
to
the
shore
in
case
of
an
accident
or
of
supporting
yourself
in
the
water
till
a
boat
could
come
to
take
you
up
it
is
probable
that
benjamin
experiment
with
his
kite
in
swimming
was
the
of
his
experiment
in
drawing
lightning
from
the
clouds
with
a
kite
thirty
years
thereafter
an
experiment
that
startled
and
electrified
the
scientific
world
the
story
is
a
familiar
one
and
should
be
repeated
here
he
believed
that
lightning
and
electricity
were
identical
experiments
for
six
years
had
led
him
to
this
conclusion
but
how
could
he
prove
it
he
conceived
the
idea
of
an
electrical
kite
by
which
he
could
settle
the
truth
or
falsity
of
his
theory
having
prepared
the
kite
he
waited
for
a
nor
did
he
wait
long
observing
one
rising
he
took
the
kite
and
with
his
son
years
of
age
stole
away
into
a
field
near
by
where
there
was
an
old
he
had
not
informed
any
one
but
his
son
of
his
purpose
because
he
wished
to
avoid
ridicule
in
case
the
experiment
proved
a
failure
the
kite
was
sent
up
in
season
for
the
coming
storm
to
catch
and
with
intense
anxiety
franklin
held
the
string
which
was
hempen
except
the
part
in
the
hand
which
was
silk
he
was
so
confident
of
success
that
he
brought
along
with
him
a
leyden
bottle
in
which
to
collect
electric
fluid
from
the
clouds
for
a
shock
it
was
a
moment
of
great
suspense
his
heart
beat
like
a
at
first
a
cloud
seemed
to
pass
directly
over
the
kite
and
the
thunder
rattled
and
the
lightnings
played
around
it
and
yet
there
was
no
indication
of
electricity
his
heart
almost
failed
him
but
in
silence
he
continued
the
experiment
as
the
storm
increased
and
drew
nearer
and
the
artillery
of
heaven
grew
louder
and
more
vivid
another
moment
and
he
beheld
the
fibers
of
the
hempen
cord
rise
as
the
hair
of
a
person
does
on
the
insulated
stool
what
a
moment
it
was
the
electric
fluid
was
there
his
experiment
was
successful
electricity
and
lightning
are
identical
pen
nor
poesy
can
describe
his
emotion
eagerly
he
applied
his
knuckles
to
the
key
attached
to
the
extremity
of
the
hempen
cord
and
drew
a
spark
therefrom
his
joy
was
immeasurable
another
spark
and
then
another
and
still
another
until
further
confirmation
was
unnecessary
the
leyden
bottle
was
charged
with
the
precious
fluid
from
which
both
father
and
son
received
a
shock
as
unmistakable
as
that
from
his
electric
battery
at
home
franklin
fame
was
secured
throughout
the
world
he
went
home
with
feelings
of
indescribable
satisfaction
doctor
franklin
was
a
very
modest
man
and
he
wrote
a
letter
to
peter
collinson
member
of
the
royal
society
of
london
dated
philadelphia
describing
the
experiment
without
even
hinting
that
he
was
the
experimenter
as
that
letter
described
his
electrical
kite
and
his
method
of
using
it
we
insert
it
here
as
frequent
mention
is
made
in
public
papers
from
europe
of
the
success
of
the
philadelphia
experiment
for
drawing
the
electric
fire
from
clouds
by
means
of
pointed
rods
of
iron
erected
on
high
buildings
it
may
be
agreeable
to
the
curious
to
be
informed
that
the
same
experiment
has
succeeded
in
philadelphia
though
made
in
a
different
and
more
easy
manner
which
is
as
follows
make
a
small
cross
of
two
light
strips
of
cedar
the
arms
so
long
as
to
reach
the
four
corners
of
a
large
thin
silk
handkerchief
when
extended
tie
the
corners
of
the
handkerchief
to
the
extremities
of
the
cross
so
you
have
the
body
of
a
kite
which
being
properly
accommodated
with
a
tail
loop
and
string
will
rise
in
the
air
like
those
made
of
paper
but
this
being
of
silk
is
fitter
to
bear
the
wet
and
wind
of
a
without
tearing
to
the
top
of
the
upright
stick
of
the
cross
is
to
be
fixed
a
very
wire
rising
a
foot
or
more
above
the
wood
to
the
end
of
the
twine
next
the
hand
is
to
be
tied
a
silk
ribbon
and
where
the
silk
and
twine
join
a
key
may
be
fastened
this
kite
is
to
be
raised
when
a
appears
to
be
coming
on
and
the
person
who
holds
the
string
must
stand
within
a
door
or
window
or
under
some
cover
so
that
the
silk
ribbon
may
not
be
wet
and
care
must
be
taken
that
the
twine
does
not
touch
the
frame
of
the
door
or
window
as
soon
as
any
of
the
come
over
the
kite
the
pointed
wire
will
draw
the
electric
fire
from
them
and
the
kite
with
all
the
twine
will
be
electrified
and
the
loose
filaments
of
the
twine
will
stand
out
every
way
and
be
attracted
by
an
approaching
finger
and
when
the
rain
has
wetted
the
kite
and
twine
so
that
it
can
conduct
the
electric
fire
freely
you
will
find
it
stream
out
plentifully
from
the
key
on
the
approach
of
your
knuckle
at
this
key
the
vial
may
be
charged
and
from
the
electric
fire
thus
obtained
spirits
may
be
kindled
and
all
other
electric
experiments
be
performed
which
are
usually
done
by
the
help
of
a
rubbed
glass
globe
or
tube
and
thereby
the
sameness
of
the
electric
matter
with
that
of
lightning
completely
demonstrated
we
have
spoken
of
the
discussions
between
benjamin
and
john
collins
upon
important
subjects
when
other
boys
were
accustomed
to
spend
their
time
in
foolish
talking
and
jesting
they
were
warmly
discussing
some
question
in
advance
of
their
years
and
well
suited
to
improve
their
minds
one
of
the
subjects
was
a
singular
one
for
that
day
female
education
legislators
statesmen
ministers
and
teachers
did
not
believe
that
girls
should
be
educated
as
thoroughly
as
boys
fewer
advantages
should
be
accorded
to
them
john
collins
accepted
the
general
view
but
benjamin
struck
out
boldly
in
favor
of
liberal
female
education
being
about
a
hundred
years
in
advance
of
his
times
it
would
be
a
waste
of
money
to
attempt
to
educate
girls
as
thoroughly
as
boys
are
educated
said
john
for
the
female
sex
are
inferior
to
the
male
in
intellectual
endowment
pshaw
exclaimed
benjamin
you
know
better
than
that
the
girls
are
not
as
simple
as
you
think
they
are
i
believe
that
females
are
not
a
whit
inferior
to
males
in
their
mental
qualities
i
would
like
to
know
where
you
discover
evidence
of
it
replied
john
there
is
no
proof
of
it
in
the
works
they
have
written
that
may
be
true
and
still
they
stand
upon
an
equality
in
respect
to
intellect
for
not
half
as
much
is
done
to
educate
them
as
there
is
to
educate
the
male
sex
how
can
you
tell
whether
they
are
mentally
inferior
or
not
until
they
are
permitted
to
enjoy
equal
advantages
as
we
tell
other
things
answered
john
females
do
not
need
so
high
mental
endowments
as
males
since
they
are
not
required
to
lead
off
in
the
different
branches
of
business
or
to
prosecute
the
sciences
i
can
see
no
wisdom
in
bestowing
talents
upon
them
which
they
never
use
and
it
is
often
said
that
is
made
in
vain
well
i
must
go
said
benjamin
but
i
think
you
have
a
weak
cause
to
defend
if
i
had
the
time
i
could
make
out
a
case
a
poor
one
i
guess
quickly
added
john
we
will
see
the
next
time
we
meet
who
can
make
out
a
case
it
will
be
some
time
before
we
meet
again
replied
benjamin
and
our
ardor
will
be
cooled
before
that
time
i
am
thinking
but
it
will
do
us
no
harm
to
discuss
the
subject
if
we
keep
our
temper
said
john
tacking
his
sentence
to
the
last
word
of
benjamin
reply
and
so
saying
they
parted
after
benjamin
had
revolved
the
subject
still
more
in
his
mind
he
became
anxious
to
commit
his
argument
to
writing
accordingly
with
pen
and
paper
in
hand
he
sat
down
to
frame
the
best
argument
he
could
in
favor
of
educating
the
female
sex
he
wrote
it
in
the
form
of
a
letter
addressed
to
his
friend
collins
and
after
having
completed
he
copied
it
in
a
fair
hand
and
sent
it
to
him
this
brought
back
a
long
reply
which
made
it
necessary
for
benjamin
to
pen
an
answer
in
this
way
the
correspondence
continued
until
several
letters
had
passed
between
them
and
each
one
had
gained
the
victory
in
his
own
estimation
benjamin
was
anxious
that
his
father
should
read
this
correspondence
as
he
would
be
a
good
judge
of
its
quality
and
after
a
little
he
took
it
to
him
saying
john
and
i
have
had
some
correspondence
and
i
want
you
should
read
our
letters
there
is
little
question
that
benjamin
was
so
well
satisfied
with
his
own
argument
that
he
expected
his
father
would
give
him
much
credit
perhaps
his
father
believed
with
most
men
of
that
day
that
the
education
of
females
was
an
unnecessary
expense
and
benjamin
expected
to
convert
him
to
his
belief
whether
it
was
so
or
not
his
father
replied
i
should
like
to
read
it
what
is
it
about
you
will
find
out
when
you
read
the
letters
franklin
improved
the
first
opportunity
to
read
the
correspondence
and
report
to
benjamin
i
have
been
very
much
pleased
and
profited
by
this
correspondence
it
is
able
for
two
boys
like
you
and
john
but
i
think
john
has
the
advantage
of
you
john
the
advantage
exclaimed
benjamin
with
considerable
surprise
and
anxiety
how
so
in
some
respects
not
in
all
i
mean
added
his
father
tell
me
of
one
thing
in
which
he
has
advantage
and
benjamin
manifested
disappointment
when
he
made
the
request
well
john
style
of
composition
seems
to
me
more
finished
and
he
expresses
himself
with
more
clearness
i
rather
think
you
are
prejudiced
father
benjamin
said
this
for
the
want
of
something
better
to
say
rather
think
not
answered
his
father
you
have
the
advantage
of
john
in
correct
spelling
and
in
punctuation
which
is
the
consequence
of
working
in
the
printing
office
but
i
can
convince
you
that
less
method
and
clearness
characterize
your
letters
than
his
i
am
ready
to
be
convinced
answered
benjamin
i
hardly
think
i
have
attained
perfection
in
writing
yet
his
father
proceeded
to
read
from
the
letters
of
each
with
the
design
of
showing
that
john
composition
was
more
perspicuous
and
that
there
was
more
method
in
his
argument
nor
was
it
a
very
difficult
task
i
am
convinced
acknowledged
benjamin
before
his
father
had
read
all
he
intended
to
read
i
can
make
improvement
in
those
things
without
much
trouble
there
is
certainly
a
good
chance
for
it
that
is
what
i
want
you
should
see
i
am
very
much
pleased
with
your
letters
for
they
show
that
you
have
talents
to
improve
and
that
you
are
an
original
independent
thinker
my
only
reason
in
calling
your
attention
to
these
defects
is
to
assist
you
in
mental
improvement
benjamin
was
just
the
boy
to
be
benefited
by
such
friendly
criticism
it
would
discourage
some
boys
and
they
would
despair
of
any
future
excellence
the
rank
and
file
of
boys
would
not
be
aroused
by
it
to
overcome
the
difficulty
and
go
up
higher
but
benjamin
was
aroused
and
he
resolved
that
his
composition
should
yet
be
characterized
by
elegance
and
perspicuity
he
set
about
that
improvement
at
once
we
shall
see
in
another
chapter
how
he
purchased
an
old
copy
of
the
for
a
model
and
set
about
improving
his
style
it
is
quite
evident
that
franklin
thought
well
of
argument
on
female
education
for
he
did
not
criticise
it
perhaps
it
was
here
that
he
found
proof
that
his
son
was
an
original
and
independent
thinker
it
is
somewhat
remarkable
that
a
boy
at
that
time
should
hold
and
advocate
views
of
female
education
that
have
not
been
advanced
generally
until
within
forty
years
looking
about
now
we
see
that
females
stand
side
by
side
with
males
in
schools
and
colleges
in
ability
and
scholarship
that
they
constitute
a
large
proportion
of
teachers
in
our
land
now
when
before
the
american
revolution
it
was
not
thought
proper
to
employ
them
at
all
that
many
of
them
are
now
classed
with
the
most
distinguished
authors
editors
and
lecturers
and
that
not
a
few
occupy
places
of
distinction
in
the
learned
professions
while
many
others
are
trusty
clerks
saleswomen
and
young
views
the
boston
a
hundred
and
seventy
years
ago
are
illustrated
and
confirmed
by
the
prominence
and
value
of
educated
females
that
a
of
fifteen
years
could
accomplish
so
much
when
he
was
obliged
to
work
from
twelve
to
fifteen
hours
each
day
at
his
trade
seems
almost
incredible
but
he
allowed
no
moments
to
run
to
waste
he
always
kept
a
book
by
him
in
the
office
and
every
spare
moment
was
employed
over
its
pages
in
the
morning
before
he
went
to
work
he
found
some
time
for
reading
and
study
he
was
an
early
riser
not
perhaps
because
he
had
no
inclination
to
lie
in
bed
but
he
had
more
time
to
improve
his
mind
he
gained
time
enough
in
the
morning
by
this
early
rising
to
acquire
more
knowledge
than
some
youth
and
young
men
do
by
going
constantly
to
school
in
the
evening
he
found
still
more
time
for
mental
improvement
extending
his
studies
often
far
into
the
night
it
was
his
opinion
that
people
generally
consume
more
time
than
is
necessary
in
sleep
and
one
of
his
maxims
penned
in
ripe
manhood
was
founded
on
that
opinion
the
sleeping
fox
catches
no
poultry
it
is
not
surprising
that
a
boy
who
subjected
himself
to
such
discipline
for
a
series
of
years
should
write
some
of
the
best
maxims
upon
this
subject
when
he
became
a
man
the
following
are
some
of
them
there
are
no
gains
without
pains
then
help
hands
for
i
have
no
lands
industry
pays
debts
while
despair
increaseth
them
never
leave
that
till
which
you
can
do
leisure
is
time
for
doing
something
useful
a
life
of
leisure
and
a
life
of
laziness
are
two
things
be
ashamed
to
catch
yourself
idle
handle
your
tools
without
mittens
remember
a
cat
in
gloves
catches
no
mice
there
is
much
to
be
done
and
perhaps
you
are
but
stick
to
it
steadily
and
you
will
see
great
effects
for
constant
dropping
wears
away
stones
and
by
diligence
and
patience
the
mouse
ate
into
the
cable
we
have
spoken
of
what
the
accomplished
as
remarkable
and
yet
it
is
not
remarkable
when
we
consider
the
work
some
men
have
done
in
leisure
hours
alone
just
here
is
one
of
the
most
important
lessons
to
be
learned
from
the
example
and
life
of
benjamin
franklin
a
similar
example
is
before
us
here
in
new
england
that
of
charles
frost
of
brattleboro
vermont
who
was
a
shoemaker
by
trade
he
died
a
few
years
since
he
wrote
of
his
own
life
when
i
went
to
my
trade
at
fourteen
years
of
age
i
formed
a
resolution
which
i
have
kept
till
now
extraordinary
preventives
only
excepted
that
i
would
faithfully
devote
hour
each
to
study
in
some
useful
branch
of
knowledge
here
was
the
secret
of
his
success
one
hour
a
day
almost
any
boy
can
have
that
he
was
when
he
wrote
the
above
a
married
man
with
three
children
still
devoting
one
hour
a
day
at
least
to
study
and
still
at
work
at
his
trade
he
had
made
such
attainments
in
mathematical
science
at
it
was
claimed
for
him
that
not
more
than
ten
mathematicians
could
be
found
in
the
united
states
in
advance
of
him
he
wrote
further
of
himself
the
first
book
which
fell
into
my
hands
was
hutton
mathematics
an
english
work
of
great
celebrity
a
complete
mathematical
course
which
i
then
commenced
namely
at
fourteen
i
finished
it
at
nineteen
without
an
instructor
i
then
took
up
those
studies
to
which
i
could
apply
my
knowledge
of
mathematics
as
mechanics
and
mathematical
astronomy
i
think
i
can
say
that
i
possess
and
have
successfully
studied
the
most
approved
english
and
american
works
on
these
subjects
after
this
he
commenced
natural
philosophy
and
physical
astronomy
then
chemistry
geology
and
mineralogy
collecting
and
arranging
a
cabinet
mr
frost
continues
next
natural
philosophy
engaged
my
attention
which
i
followed
up
with
close
observation
gleaning
my
information
from
a
great
many
sources
the
works
that
treat
of
them
at
large
are
rare
and
expensive
but
i
have
a
considerable
knowledge
of
geology
ornithology
entomology
and
conchology
not
only
this
he
added
to
his
store
of
knowledge
the
science
of
botany
and
made
himself
master
of
it
he
made
extensive
surveys
in
his
own
state
of
the
trees
shrubs
herbs
ferns
mosses
lichens
and
fungi
he
had
the
best
collection
of
ferns
in
the
united
states
he
also
directed
his
attention
to
meteorology
and
devoted
much
of
his
time
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
law
of
storms
and
the
movements
of
the
erratic
and
extraordinary
bodies
in
the
air
and
heavens
he
took
up
the
study
of
latin
and
pursued
it
until
he
could
read
it
fluently
he
read
all
the
standard
poets
and
had
copies
of
their
works
in
his
library
also
he
became
proficient
in
history
while
his
miscellaneous
reading
was
very
extensive
of
his
books
he
wrote
i
have
a
library
which
i
divide
into
three
departments
scientific
religious
literary
comprising
the
standard
works
published
in
this
country
containing
five
or
six
hundred
volumes
i
have
purchased
these
books
from
time
to
time
with
money
saved
for
the
purpose
by
some
small
benjamin
franklin
record
on
the
whole
may
surpass
this
both
of
them
show
however
what
the
persistent
and
systematic
improvement
of
spare
moments
will
accomplish
if
a
girl
or
boy
can
command
one
hour
a
day
for
reading
twenty
pages
could
be
read
thoughtfully
in
that
time
or
one
hundred
and
forty
pages
in
a
week
in
a
single
year
more
than
seven
thousand
pages
which
is
equal
to
eighteen
large
duodecimo
volumes
in
twenty
years
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pages
or
three
hundred
and
volumes
of
the
size
named
above
divide
this
amount
of
reading
among
history
philosophy
chemistry
biography
and
general
literature
and
the
reader
will
be
well
versed
in
these
several
departments
of
knowledge
the
old
adage
is
time
is
money
but
the
leisure
time
of
franklin
was
worth
vastly
more
than
money
as
it
is
to
every
youth
for
it
was
culture
usefulness
and
character
xi
starting
a
newspaper
benjamin
had
been
in
the
printing
office
about
three
years
when
his
brother
decided
to
publish
a
newspaper
it
was
a
doubtful
enterprise
from
the
outset
and
friends
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
it
but
he
viewed
the
matter
from
his
own
standpoint
as
the
franklins
were
wont
to
do
and
the
paper
was
started
it
was
called
the
new
england
courant
and
the
first
number
was
issued
only
three
papers
in
the
whole
country
were
published
before
this
the
first
one
was
boston
established
april
two
years
before
the
birth
of
benjamin
it
was
only
a
of
paper
about
the
size
of
an
eight
by
twelve
inch
pane
of
glass
in
two
pages
folio
with
two
columns
on
each
page
it
could
not
have
contained
more
printed
matter
than
is
now
compressed
into
or
page
of
one
of
our
boston
dailies
the
other
papers
were
boston
established
and
american
weekly
of
philadelphia
there
was
not
a
little
commotion
when
james
franklin
launched
new
england
it
was
regarded
generally
as
a
wild
project
it
was
not
thought
that
three
newspapers
could
live
in
america
the
field
was
not
large
enough
this
fact
considered
in
contrast
with
the
supply
of
papers
and
journals
now
daily
weekly
and
monthly
shows
the
wonderful
growth
of
the
country
at
that
time
there
was
not
a
daily
paper
in
the
land
now
there
are
over
one
thousand
eight
of
them
in
the
city
of
boston
having
a
daily
circulation
of
from
three
to
four
hundred
thousand
the
papers
and
magazines
of
the
united
states
of
all
descriptions
reach
the
surprising
aggregate
of
nearly
twenty
thousand
and
their
circulation
is
almost
fabulous
one
hundred
thousand
and
even
two
hundred
thousand
daily
is
claimed
for
some
journals
some
weekly
issues
reach
three
hundred
thousand
and
even
four
and
five
hundred
thousand
bind
the
daily
issues
of
boston
into
volumes
containing
one
hundred
sheets
each
and
we
have
an
enormous
library
of
daily
newspapers
numbering
about
one
million
volumes
the
annual
production
of
the
boston
daily
press
now
and
this
is
the
aggregate
of
only
the
eight
dailies
while
boston
has
nearly
two
hundred
papers
and
periodicals
of
all
sorts
and
the
state
of
massachusetts
nearly
four
hundred
if
the
eight
boston
dailies
measure
one
yard
each
in
width
when
opened
on
the
average
and
they
are
laid
end
to
end
we
have
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
yards
of
newspapers
laid
each
day
which
is
equal
to
hundred
and
seventy
daily
over
thousand
in
a
week
and
thousand
one
hundred
and
in
a
year
more
than
enough
papers
to
reach
twice
around
the
earth
or
suppose
we
weigh
these
papers
if
ten
of
them
weigh
a
single
pound
then
each
day
issue
weighs
thousand
each
week
issue
hundred
and
eighty
the
aggregate
of
the
year
amounting
to
nine
million
pounds
load
this
yearly
production
upon
wagons
one
ton
on
each
and
we
have
a
procession
of
four
thousand
five
hundred
wagons
that

one

to
a

over
fourteen

in
the
procession
benjamin
was
much
given
to
prophesying
but
no
prophecy
from
his
lips
ever
covered
such
a
growth
as
this
he
was
in
favor
of
starting
the
paper
but
he
could
not
have
had
the
faintest
conception
of
what
was
going
to
follow
i
want
to
set
up
the
paper
he
said
to
james
i
think
i
can
make
the
best
looking
paper
i
think
you
can
and
it
is
going
to
require
much
attention
and
planning
to
make
it
a
success
i
may
fail
in
the
attempt
but
have
the
satisfaction
of
trying
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
make
it
succeed
if
i
have
to
sit
up
nights
benjamin
continued
it
will
give
your
office
notoriety
to
publish
a
paper
but
how
will
you
dispose
of
it
sell
it
on
the
street
and
you
will
be
a
good
hand
to
do
that
no
doubt
there
will
be
some
regular
subscribers
and
you
can
deliver
copies
to
them
from
week
to
week
and
be
collector
too
i
suppose
added
benjamin
who
had
no
objection
to
any
part
of
the
work
named
as
you
please
about
that
doubtless
it
will
be
convenient
to
have
you
attend
to
that
at
times
at
least
you
wo
make
me
editor
yet
i
conclude
remarked
benjamin
facetiously
thinking
that
about
all
the
work
on
the
paper
except
the
editorship
had
been
assigned
to
him
not
yet
i
think
responded
james
printer
and
collector
will
be
as
much
honor
as
any
one
of
the
franklins
can
withstand
at
once
and
he
had
as
little
idea
of
the
part
benjamin
would
play
in
the
enterprise
as
the
boy
himself
there
is
no
doubt
that
benjamin
had
an
idea
that
the
paper
might
have
in
its
columns
some
of
his
fugitive
pieces
sooner
or
later
he
had
been
cultivating
his
talents
in
this
direction
and
never
was
enjoying
it
more
than
he
was
at
the
time
the
england
was
established
how
many
copies
shall
you
publish
in
the
first
issue
inquired
benjamin
i
am
not
quite
decided
about
that
anywhere
from
two
to
three
hundred
we
will
see
how
it
goes
first
how
about
articles
for
it
will
you
have
any
trouble
about
getting
articles
none
at
all
i
am
to
have
several
articles
at
once
for
the
first
number
from
parties
who
can
write
well
and
when
the
paper
is
well
under
way
there
will
be
a
plenty
of
volunteer
contributors
i
have
no
fears
about
that
benjamin
might
have
responded
here
is
one
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
already
flattering
himself
with
the
idea
that
he
would
be
a
contributor
to
its
columns
known
or
unknown
here
was
the
real
secret
of
his
enthusiastic
interest
in
the
enterprise
on
the
day
mentioned
the
new
paper
was
issued
as
had
been
announced
and
great
was
the
anxiety
of
the
publisher
many
citizens
awaited
its
coming
with
lively
anticipations
and
on
the
whole
it
was
a
memorable
occasion
no
one
interest
surpassed
that
of
the
benjamin
who
had
no
hesitation
in
selling
the
paper
on
the
street
and
rather
liked
that
part
of
the
business
in
his
view
it
was
an
honorable
and
enterprising
venture
that
challenged
the
respect
and
support
of
every
citizen
the
reception
of
the
was
all
that
james
anticipated
it
sold
as
well
as
he
expected
and
the
comments
upon
its
ability
and
character
were
as
favorable
as
the
times
and
circumstances
would
warrant
there
were
criticisms
of
course
and
severe
ones
too
for
in
that
day
all
sorts
of
projects
were
subjected
to
a
crucial
test
the
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
now
that
the
newspaper
is
launched
and
there
is
new
interest
and
activity
in
consequence
in
the
printing
office
we
will
recur
to
an
episode
in
benjamin
career
that
occurred
two
years
before
for
it
sustains
a
very
close
relation
to
the
newspaper
enterprise
and
what
followed
benjamin
had
been
in
the
printing
office
about
a
year
when
he
surprised
his
brother
by
the
inquiry
how
much
will
you
allow
me
a
week
if
i
will
board
myself
do
you
think
i
pay
more
for
your
board
than
it
is
worth
replied
james
by
asking
another
question
instead
of
answering
the
one
propounded
no
more
than
you
will
be
obliged
to
pay
in
any
other
family
but
more
than
i
shall
ask
you
it
costs
you
now
more
than
you
need
to
pay
james
was
still
boarding
benjamin
in
a
family
near
by
then
you
think
of
opening
a
for
the
special
accommodation
of
benjamin
franklin
i
see
which
was
treating
the
subject
rather
lightly
i
propose
to
board
myself
answered
benjamin
distinctly
and
emphatically
i
do
not
eat
meat
of
any
kind
as
you
know
so
that
i
can
board
myself
easily
and
i
will
agree
to
do
it
if
you
will
give
me
weekly
the
money
you
pay
for
my
board
of
course
i
will
agree
to
it
answered
james
it
will
be
so
much
in
my
pocket
and
the
bargain
is
made
when
will
you
begin
to
keep
your
boarder
was
benjamin
quick
reply
a
vegetarian
can
open
a
for
himself
without
much
preparation
it
is
then
but
it
will
not
take
you
long
to
become
sick
of
that
arrangement
keeping
boarders
is
not
a
taking
business
even
if
you
have
no
boarder
but
yourself
that
is
my
lookout
continued
benjamin
i
have
my
own
ideas
about
diet
and
work
play
and
study
and
some
other
things
and
i
am
going
to
reduce
them
to
practice
benjamin
had
been
reading
a
work
on
vegetable
diet
by
one
tryon
and
it
was
this
which
induced
him
to
discard
meats
as
an
article
of
food
he
was
made
to
believe
that
better
health
and
a
clearer
head
would
be
the
result
though
from
all
we
can
learn
he
was
not
lacking
in
either
tryon
in
his
work
gave
directions
for
cooking
vegetables
such
dishes
as
a
vegetarian
might
use
so
that
the
matter
of
boarding
himself
was
made
quite
simple
the
great
object
which
benjamin
had
in
view
was
to
save
money
for
buying
books
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
way
open
to
get
money
for
that
purpose
at
the
same
time
he
would
have
more
hours
to
read
he
had
been
trying
the
vegetable
diet
at
his
boarding
place
for
some
time
and
he
liked
it
he
was
really
one
of
tryon
converts
other
boarders
ridiculed
his
diet
and
had
considerable
sport
over
his
oddity
but
he
cared
nothing
for
that
they
could
eat
what
they
pleased
and
so
could
he
he
was
as
independent
on
the
subject
of
diet
as
he
was
on
any
other
he
did
not
pin
his
faith
in
any
thing
upon
the
sleeve
of
another
he
fastened
it
to
his
own
sleeve
and
let
it
fly
the
incident
illustrates
the
difference
between
the
two
brothers
if
james
had
been
as
unselfish
and
generous
as
benjamin
was
he
would
have
paid
the
latter
the
full
amount
of
his
board
weekly
he
would
have
said
you
have
a
passion
for
reading
and
study
you
do
this
for
you
want
to
know
more
and
make
the
most
of
yourself
that
you
can
in
these
circumstances
i
will
not
make
any
money
out
of
you
if
i
give
you
the
whole
amount
i
pay
for
board
i
shall
lose
nothing
and
you
will
gain
considerable
it
will
help
you
and
i
shall
be
kept
whole
in
my
finances
you
shall
have
it
all
but
the
fact
was
james
was
avaricious
and
was
bent
on
making
money
though
he
made
it
out
of
his
younger
brother
on
the
other
hand
benjamin
was
and
generous
or
he
never
would
have
offered
in
the
outset
to
take
half
james
paid
for
his
board
had
he
been
as
niggardly
as
james
he
could
have
made
a
better
bargain
than
that
for
himself
but
it
was
not
a
good
bargain
that
he
was
after
he
was
after
the
books
james
was
curious
to
see
how
benjamin
would
succeed
with
his
new
method
of
living
so
he
watched
him
closely
without
saying
any
thing
in
particular
about
it
perhaps
expecting
that
his
brother
would
soon
tire
of
boarding
himself
weeks
passed
by
and
still
benjamin
was
hale
strong
and
as
ever
his
actions
indicated
that
he
was
well
satisfied
both
with
his
bargain
and
his
board
finally
however
james
curiosity
grew
to
such
proportions
that
he
inquired
one
day
ben
how
much
do
you
make
by
boarding
yourself
i
save
just
half
the
money
you
pay
me
so
that
it
costs
me
just
as
much
as
you
paid
for
my
board
you
understand
economy
i
must
confess
remarked
james
however
i
ought
to
be
satisfied
if
you
are
perhaps
his
conscience
might
have
troubled
him
somewhat
and
caused
him
to
think
how
much
better
off
his
young
brother
would
have
been
if
he
had
given
him
the
full
amount
of
the
board
as
he
should
have
done
if
benjamin
had
been
a
common
boy
without
high
aspirations
and
noble
endeavors
or
a
spendthrift
or
idler
there
might
have
been
some
excuse
for
driving
a
close
bargain
with
him
but
in
the
circumstances
the
act
was
unbrotherly
and
ungenerous
the
money
i
save
is
not
the
best
part
of
it
added
benjamin
after
a
little
i
save
a
and
more
usually
every
noon
for
reading
after
i
have
eaten
my
meal
i
usually
read
as
long
as
that
before
you
return
from
dinner
not
a
very
sumptuous
dinner
i
reckon
sawdust
pudding
perhaps
with
cold
water
sauce
when
i
work
i
want
something
to
work
on
living
on
nothing
would
be
hard
on
me
james
indicated
by
this
remark
that
he
had
no
confidence
in
that
sort
of
diet
i
live
well
enough
for
me
a
biscuit
or
a
slice
of
bread
with
a
tart
or
a
few
raisins
and
a
glass
of
water
make
a
good
dinner
for
me
and
then
my
head
is
all
the
lighter
for
study
yes
i
should
think
you
might
have
a
light
head
with
such
living
retorted
james
and
your
body
will
be
as
light
before
many
weeks
i
prophesy
i
will
risk
it
i
am
on
a
study
now
that
requires
a
clear
head
and
i
am
determined
to
master
it
what
is
that
cocker
arithmetic
begin
to
wish
that
you
knew
something
of
arithmetic
by
this
time
making
up
for
misspent
time
i
see
paying
old
debts
is
not
interesting
business
james
meant
this
last
remark
for
a
fling
at
benjamin
dislike
for
arithmetic
when
he
attended
school
not
devoting
himself
to
it
with
the
enthusiasm
he
gave
to
more
congenial
studies
he
was
more
deficient
in
that
branch
of
knowledge
than
in
any
other
he
regretted
his
neglect
of
the
study
now
and
was
determined
to
make
up
his
loss
this
was
very
honorable
and
showed
a
noble
aim
which
merited
praise
instead
of
a
fling
from
his
brother
i
think
it
must
be
a
sort
of
luxury
to
pay
old
debts
if
one
has
any
thing
to
pay
them
with
remarked
benjamin
if
i
can
make
up
any
loss
of
former
years
now
i
enjoy
doing
it
even
by
the
closest
economy
of
time
well
you
estimate
time
as
closely
as
a
miser
counts
his
money
ben
and
i
have
a
right
to
do
it
as
little
time
as
i
have
to
myself
requires
that
i
should
calculate
closely
time
is
money
to
you
or
else
you
would
allow
me
a
little
more
to
myself
and
it
is
more
than
money
to
me
how
so
it
enables
me
to
acquire
knowledge
which
i
can
not
buy
with
money
unless
i
were
saving
of
my
time
i
should
not
be
able
to
read
or
study
at
all
having
to
work
so
constantly
perhaps
at
this
time
benjamin
laid
the
foundation
for
that
economy
which
distinguished
him
in
later
life
and
about
which
he
often
wrote
among
his
wise
sayings
in
the
height
of
his
influence
and
fame
were
the
following
if
you
would
be
wealthy
think
of
saving
as
well
as
of
getting
what
maintains
one
vice
would
bring
up
two
children

bottom
it
is

to

a

a

a

a

that
wastes
idly
a

another
wastes
the
privilege
of

in
short
the
way
to
wealth
if
you
desire
it
is
as
plain
as
the
way
to

it
depends
chiefly
on
two
words
and
that
is
waste
neither
nor

make
the
best

with
them

that

governs
the
world
to
whom
all
should
look
for
a
blessing
on
their
honest
endeavors
doth
not
in
his
wise
providence
otherwise
determine
the
reader
may
desire
to
know
just
how
franklin
himself
speaks
of
the
vegetable
diet
experiment
in
his
autobiography
so
we
quote
it
here
i
happened
to
meet
with
a
book
written
by
one
tryon
recommending
a
vegetable
diet
i
determined
to
go
into
it
my
brother
being
yet
unmarried
did
not
keep
house
but
boarded
himself
and
his
apprentices
in
another
family
my
refusing
to
eat
flesh
occasioned
an
inconvenience
and
i
was
frequently
chid
for
my
singularity
i
made
myself
acquainted
with
tryon
manner
of
preparing
some
of
his
dishes
such
as
boiling
potatoes
or
rice
making
and
a
few
others
and
then
proposed
to
my
brother
that
if
he
would
give
me
weekly
half
the
money
he
paid
for
my
board
i
would
board
myself
he
instantly
agreed
to
it
and
i
presently
found
that
i
could
save
half
what
he
paid
me
this
was
an
additional
fund
for
buying
of
books
but
i
had
another
advantage
in
it
my
brother
and
the
rest
going
from
the
printing
house
to
their
meals
i
remained
there
alone
and
despatching
presently
my
light
repast
which
was
often
no
more
than
a
biscuit
or
a
slice
of
bread
a
handful
of
raisins
or
a
tart
from
the
pastry
cook
and
a
glass
of
water
had
the
rest
of
the
time
till
their
return
for
study
in
which
i
made
the
greater
progress
from
that
greater
clearness
of
head
and
quicker
apprehension
which
generally
attend
temperance
in
eating
and
drinking
now
it
was
that
being
on
some
occasion
made
ashamed
of
my
ignorance
in
figures
which
i
had
twice
failed
learning
when
at
school
i
took
cocker
book
on
arithmetic
and
went
through
the
whole
by
myself
with
the
greatest
ease
xii
the
ruse
and
what
came
of
it
parton
says
of
the
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
sheet
of
all
the
colonial
newspapers
it
was
the
most
spirited
witty
and
daring
the
bostonians
accustomed
to
the
monotonous
dullness
of
the
received
some
with
delight
more
with
horror
all
with
amazement
this
weekly
budget
of
impudence
and
fun
a
knot
of
liberals
gathered
around
james
franklin
physicians
most
of
them
able
audacious
men
who
kept
him
well
supplied
with
squibs
essays
and
every
variety
of
sense
and
nonsense
known
in
that
age
the
was
indeed
to
borrow
the
slang
of
the
present
day
a
paper
such
a
tempest
did
it
stir
up
in
boston
that
the
noise
thereof
was
heard
in
the
remote
colony
of
pennsylvania
the
knot
of
liberals
who
wrote
articles
for
it
met
often
at
the
office
to
discuss
their
contributions
and
the
state
of
public
sentiment
more
or
less
affected
by
this
venture
the
came
in
for
a
large
share
of
the
opposition
and
they
declared
war
against
many
of
the
existing
customs
governmental
political
and
social
the
scope
and
circulation
of
the
paper
was
a
frequent
topic
of
remark
benjamin
ears
were
always
open
to
their
conversation
he
heard
the
merits
of
different
articles
set
forth
and
learned
that
certain
ones
were
quite
popular
and
elicited
favorable
remarks
from
readers
generally
this
excited
his
ambition
and
he
strongly
desired
to
try
his
own
ability
in
writing
for
the
paper
he
feared
however
that
his
composition
would
not
be
regarded
favorably
if
it
were
known
who
was
the
author
so
he
resorted
to
the
following
expedient
i
will
write
an
anonymous
article
he
said
within
himself
in
the
best
style
i
can
and
get
it
into
james
hand
in
some
way
that
will
not
arouse
his
suspicions
i
will
disguise
my
handwriting
and
give
it
some
fictitious
name
so
that
he
will
not
dream
that
it
was
written
in
the
office
accordingly
the
article
was
prepared
describing
his
ideal
of
character
and
that
was
the
character
he
himself
formed
and
was
forming
then
and
he
signed
it
silence
dogood
this
article
he
slipped
under
the
printing
office
door
at
night
where
james
found
it
in
the
morning
and
read
it
with
evident
satisfaction
as
benjamin
thought
who
narrowly
watched
him
in
a
little
while
some
of
the
knot
of
liberals
came
in
and
the
article
was
read
to
them
it
is
a
good
article
and
it
was
slipped
under
the
door
last
night
said
james
it
is
signed
dogood
you
have
no
idea
who
wrote
it
then
inquired
one
not
the
least
whatever
it
is
capital
whoever
the
author
may
be
remarked
one
of
the
critics
somebody
wrote
it
who
knows
how
to
wield
his
pen
said
another
ordinarily
i
shall
not
publish
articles
without
knowing
who
the
author
is
remarked
james
but
this
is
so
good
that
i
shall
not
stop
to
inquire
i
shall
put
it
into
the
next
issue
by
all
means
of
course
replied
one
no
doubt
we
shall
soon
learn
who
the
author
is
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
keep
such
things
secret
for
a
long
time
the
author
is
evidently
a
person
of
ability
added
another
every
sentence
in
the
article
is
charged
with
thought
i
should
judge
that
he
needed
only
practice
to
make
him
a
writer
of
the
first
class
publishing
the
article
will
be
as
likely
as
any
thing
to
bring
out
the
author
suggested
james
that
is
so
and
the
sooner
it
is
published
the
better
remarked
one
of
the
company
approvingly
much
more
was
said
in
praise
of
the
article
the
names
of
several
prominent
citizens
of
boston
were
mentioned
as
the
possible
author
james
himself
named
one
or
two
who
were
boston
most
intelligent
and
influential
citizens
as
the
possible
author
all
approved
the
insertion
of
the
article
in
the
next
issue
of
the
paper
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
benjamin
who
was
the
most
deeply
interested
party
in
the
office
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
act
in
regard
to
the
article
whether
to
father
it
at
once
or
still
conceal
its
parentage
on
the
whole
however
he
decided
to
withhold
its
authorship
for
the
present
and
try
his
hand
again
in
the
same
way
the
reader
may
judge
of
benjamin
emotions
when
he
came
to
put
his
own
article
in
type
for
the
paper
it
was
almost
too
good
to
be
real
fact
was
even
stranger
than
fiction
to
him
in
the
outset
he
dreamed
that
somehow
and
sometime
the
columns
of
the
might
contain
a
contribution
of
his
own
and
here
he
was
setting
up
his
first
article
with
the
approval
of
james
and
the
whole
knot
of
liberals
this
was
more
than
he
bargained
for
and
his
heart
never
came
so
near
beating
through
his
jacket
as
then
never
was
a
so
happy
before
he
was
happy
all
over
and
all
through
a
lump
of
happiness
not
one
boy
in
a
hundred
could
have
managed
to
keep
the
secret
as
he
did
in
the
circumstances
their
countenances
would
have
exposed
it
on
the
spot
but
benjamin
possessed
his
soul
in
patience
and
carried
out
his
ruse
admirably
the
issue
containing
benjamin
article
appeared
on
time
and
was
greatly
praised
who
is
dogood
was
the
most
common
inquiry
i
wonder
who
dogood
can
be
was
a
frequent
remark
showing
that
the
article
attracted
much
attention
benjamin
wondered
as
much
as
any
of
them
a
queer
signature
to
put
to
an
article
he
said
what
in
the
world
could
suggest
such
a
de
to
a
writer
he
enjoyed
his
ruse
more
and
more
it
became
the
choicest
fun
of
his
life
it
was
so
crammed
with
felicity
that
he
resolved
to
continue
it
by
writing
more
articles
as
and
good
he
was
able
to
prepare
a
better
article
for
the
second
one
because
he
brought
to
its
preparation
the
enthusiasm
and
encouragement
awakened
by
the
favorable
reception
of
the
first
besides
the
many
remarks
he
had
heard
about
it
gave
him
points
for
another
communication
so
as
to
make
it
sharper
better
adapted
to
the
times
and
hence
more
timely
within
a
short
time
the
second
article
was
slipped
under
the
door
at
night
for
james
to
pick
up
in
the
morning
another
article
from
dogood
exclaimed
james
as
he
opened
it
and
read
the
signature
i
thought
we
should
hear
from
that
writer
again
was
all
the
remark
that
benjamin
vouchsafed
a
good
subject
added
james
as
he
read
the
caption
i
will
read
it
and
he
proceeded
to
read
the
article
to
benjamin
the
latter
listened
with
attention
that
was
somewhat
divided
between
the
excellent
reception
the
article
was
having
and
the
grand
success
of
his
ruse
better
even
than
the
first
article
remarked
james
after
having
read
it
we
must
not
rest
until
we
find
out
who
the
author
is
it
is
somebody
of
note
the
second
article
was
submitted
to
the
knot
of
liberals
the
same
as
the
first
one
and
all
approved
it
highly
it
is
sharper
than
the
first
one
and
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
every
time
said
one
of
the
number
dogood
is
a
good
name
for
such
a
writer
and
we
shall
have
more
of
them
no
doubt
suggested
james
it
is
quite
evident
that
the
writer
means
to
keep
on
i
hope
he
will
such
articles
will
call
attention
to
the
paper
and
that
is
what
we
want
added
another
in
the
mean
time
let
us
find
out
if
possible
who
the
writer
is
suggested
still
another
it
will
be
a
help
to
the
paper
to
have
it
known
who
is
the
author
if
it
is
one
of
the
scholars
charles
dickens
was
a
poorer
boy
than
benjamin
ever
was
knowing
what
it
was
to
go
to
bed
hungry
and
cold
but
his
young
heart
aspired
after
a
nobler
life
and
while
yet
a
boy
he
wrote
an
article
for
the
press
disclosing
the
fact
not
even
to
his
mother
and
then
on
a
dark
night
he
dropped
it
into
a
dark
letter
box
in
a
dark
office
up
a
dark
court
in
fleet
street
his
joy
was
too
great
for
utterance
when
he
saw
it
in
print
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
career
as
a
writer
unparalleled
in
english
or
american
history
and
he
told
the
secret
of
it
when
he
wrote
while
other
boys
played
i
read
roderick
random
tom
jones
the
vicar
of
wakefield
don
quixote
gil
bias
and
other
books
they
kept
alive
my
fancy
and
my
hope
of
something
beyond
that
place
and
time
benjamin
heard
all
that
was
said
and
still
kept
his
secret
it
would
not
have
been
strange
if
his
vanity
had
been
inflated
by
these
complimentary
remarks
ordinary
humanity
could
scarcely
be
exposed
to
so
high
praise
without
taking
on
a
new
sense
of
its
importance
but
benjamin
kept
down
his
pride
and
his
heart
continued
to
abide
under
his
jacket
though
it
beat
mightily
was
it
any
wonder
without
stopping
to
narrate
details
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
benjamin
wrote
several
articles
and
sent
them
forward
to
james
under
the
door
and
they
were
all
pronounced
good
by
james
and
his
friends
he
began
to
think
that
it
was
almost
time
to
let
out
the
secret
james
was
fairly
committed
to
the
excellence
of
all
the
articles
and
so
were
the
other
critics
this
was
important
to
the
success
of
benjamin
plan
he
had
feared
as
he
had
continued
industriously
to
set
up
type
that
a
disclosure
would
knock
all
his
plans
into
pi
but
he
had
no
fears
now
but
how
should
he
disclose
that
was
the
question
it
was
not
long
however
before
the
question
was
settled
his
brother
made
some
remark
about
the
last
article
slipped
under
the
door
and
wondered
that
the
author
had
not
become
known
i
know
who
the
author
is
said
benjamin
under
such
a
degree
of
excitement
as
even
an
older
person
would
experience
on
the
eve
of
an
important
revelation
you
know
exclaimed
james
in
great
surprise
if
you
know
why
have
you
not
disclosed
it
before
because
i
thought
it
was
not
wise
it
is
not
best
to
tell
all
we
know
always
but
you
have
heard
us
discuss
this
matter
over
and
over
and
take
measures
to
discover
the
author
and
yet
you
have
never
intimated
that
you
knew
any
thing
about
it
well
the
author
did
not
wish
to
be
known
until
the
right
time
came
and
that
is
a
good
reason
for
keeping
the
matter
secret
i
think
will
you
tell
who
the
author
is
now
asked
james
impatient
to
obtain
the
information
perhaps
i
will
if
you
are
very
anxious
to
know
of
course
i
am
and
every
one
else
who
is
interested
in
the
paper
that
was
the
crisis
to
james
we
can
scarcely
conceive
of
its
interest
to
the
his
time
of
triumph
had
come
james
had
not
treated
him
very
well
and
we
think
he
enjoyed
that
moment
of
victory
a
little
more
for
that
reason
that
would
have
been
human
and
benjamin
was
human
his
ruse
had
proved
successful
and
his
talents
too
now
he
could
startle
his
brother
as
much
as
would
a
out
of
a
clear
sky
so
he
answered
his
inquiry
by
saying
benjamin
franklin
and
he
said
it
with
emphasis
and
an
air
of
triumph
if
james
countenance
could
have
been
photographed
at
that
moment
it
would
have
shown
a
mixture
of
amazement
incredulity
and
wonder
it
was
several
moments
before
he
so
far
recovered
from
the
shock
as
to
be
able
to
speak
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
wrote
those
articles
benjamin
might
have
discovered
some
doubt
in
james
tone
and
appearance
when
he
spoke
certainly
i
do
but
it
is
not
your
handwriting
it
is
my
handwriting
disguised
i
wa
fool
enough
to
let
you
have
the
articles
in
my
own
handwriting
without
disguise
when
i
wished
to
conceal
the
authorship
what
could
possibly
be
your
object
in
doing
so
that
the
articles
might
be
fairly
examined
if
i
had
proposed
to
write
an
article
for
your
paper
you
would
have
said
that
i
a
could
write
nothing
worthy
of
print
but
if
i
had
seen
and
read
the
articles
knowing
them
to
be
yours
i
should
have
judged
them
fairly
james
insisted
evidently
feeling
somewhat
hurt
by
his
brother
last
remark
nevertheless
benjamin
was
right
it
is
probable
that
his
articles
would
have
been
rejected
had
he
offered
them
in
his
own
name
to
the
critics
well
that
was
my
plan
and
the
articles
have
had
a
fair
show
and
i
am
satisfied
whether
you
are
or
not
was
benjamin
reply
in
an
independent
spirit
here
the
conversation
dropped
james
bestowed
no
words
of
commendation
upon
his
brother
ability
perhaps
he
thought
that
he
had
praised
the
articles
enough
when
he
did
not
know
who
the
author
was
but
he
appeared
to
be
abstracted
in
thought
until
some
of
the
knot
of
liberals
came
in
i
have
discovered
who
dogood
is
he
said
you
have
who
can
it
be
and
the
speaker
was
very
much
surprised
no
one
that
you
have
dreamed
of
is
that
so
i
am
all
the
more
anxious
to
learn
who
it
is
he
continued
there
he
is
replied
james
pointing
to
benjamin
who
was
setting
type
a
little
more
briskly
than
usual
as
if
he
was
oblivious
to
what
was
going
on
what
benjamin
you
are
joking
surely
replied
one
your
brother
out
there
exclaimed
another
pointing
to
benjamin
you
do
not
mean
it
yes
i
do
mean
it
he
is
the
author
and
he
has
satisfied
me
that
he
is
you
can
see
for
yourselves
the
knot
of
liberals
was
never
so
amazed
and
now
they
all
turned
to
benjamin
and
he
had
to
speak
for
himself
they
were
not
entirely
satisfied
that
there
was
not
some
mistake
or
deception
about
the
matter
but
he
found
little
difficulty
in
convincing
them
that
he
was
the
real
author
of
the
communications
whereupon
they
lavished
their
commendations
upon
him
to
such
an
extent
as
to
make
it
perilous
to
one
having
much
vanity
in
his
heart
from
that
time
benjamin
was
a
favorite
with
the
literary
visitors
at
the
office
they
showed
him
much
more
attention
than
they
did
james
and
said
so
much
in
his
praise
as
a
youth
of
unusual
promise
that
james
became
jealous
and
irritable
he
was
naturally
passionate
and
tyrannical
and
this
sudden
and
unexpected
exaltation
of
benjamin
developed
his
overbearing
spirit
he
found
more
fault
with
him
and
became
very
unreasonable
in
his
treatment
probably
he
had
never
dreamed
that
benjamin
possessed
more
talents
than
other
boys
of
his
age
nor
did
he
care
so
long
as
his
brother
was
an
apprentice
and
he
could
rule
over
him
as
a
master
he
did
not
appear
to
regard
the
between
them
but
only
that
of
master
and
apprentice
in
other
words
he
was
a
poor
specimen
of
a
brother
and
we
shall
learn
more
about
him
in
the
sequel
in
his
autobiography
franklin
tells
the
story
of
his
ruse
as
follows
james
had
some
ingenious
men
among
his
friends
who
amused
themselves
by
writing
little
pieces
for
this
paper
which
gained
it
credit
and
made
it
more
in
demand
and
these
gentlemen
often
visited
us
hearing
their
conversations
and
their
accounts
of
the
approbation
their
papers
were
received
with
i
was
excited
to
try
my
hand
among
them
but
being
still
a
boy
and
suspecting
that
my
brother
would
object
to
printing
any
thing
of
mine
in
his
paper
if
he
knew
it
to
be
mine
i
contrived
to
disguise
my
hand
and
writing
an
anonymous
paper
i
put
it
at
night
under
the
door
of
the
printing
house
it
was
found
in
the
morning
and
communicated
to
his
writing
friends
when
they
called
in
as
usual
they
read
it
commented
on
it
in
my
hearing
and
i
had
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
finding
it
met
with
their
approbation
and
that
in
their
different
guesses
at
the
author
none
were
named
but
men
of
some
character
among
us
for
learning
and
ingenuity
i
suppose
that
i
was
rather
lucky
in
my
judges
and
that
they
were
not
really
so
very
good
as
i
then
believed
them
to
be
encouraged
however
by
this
attempt
i
wrote
and
sent
in
the
same
way
to
the
press
several
other
pieces
that
were
equally
approved
and
i
kept
my
secret
till
all
my
fund
of
sense
for
such
performances
was
exhausted
and
then
discovered
it
when
i
began
to
be
considered
a
little
more
by
my
acquaintance
however
that
did
not
quite
please
him
as
he
thought
it
tended
to
make
me
too
vain
this
might
be
one
occasion
of
the
differences
we
began
to
have
about
this
time
though
a
brother
he
considered
himself
as
my
master
and
me
as
his
apprentice
and
accordingly
expected
the
same
services
from
me
as
he
would
from
another
while
i
thought
he
degraded
me
too
much
in
some
he
required
of
me
who
from
a
brother
expected
more
indulgence
the
foregoing
was
one
of
the
incidents
of
benjamin
boyhood
that
decided
his
future
eminent
career
it
was
a
good
thing
to
bring
out
his
talents
as
a
writer
thus
early
and
it
introduced
him
to
an
exercise
that
was
of
the
first
importance
in
the
improvement
of
his
mind
from
the
time
he
wrote
the
first
article
for
the
he
did
not
cease
to
write
for
the
public
probably
no
other
american
boy
began
his
public
career
so
early
sixteen
he
had
written
much
before
but
it
was
not
for
the
press
it
was
done
for
and
not
for
the
public
eye
the
newspaper
opened
a
new
and
unexpected
channel
of
communication
with
the
public
that
was
well
suited
to
awaken
his
deepest
interest
and
inspire
his
noblest
efforts
the
incident
reminds
us
of
canning
he
the
great
english
statesman
was
scarcely
as
old
as
benjamin
when
he
established
a
boy
periodical
in
the
school
at
eton
whither
he
was
sent
it
was
christened
which
means
literally
the
little
world
it
was
a
weekly
publication
issued
from
windsor
it
was
conducted
after
the
plan
of
the
a
work
that
was
of
immense
value
to
benjamin
as
we
shall
see
the
design
being
to
treat
the
characteristics
of
the
boys
at
eton
as
addison
and
his
friends
had
done
those
of
general
society
in
this
paper
several
members
of
the
school
figured
with
credit
to
themselves
though
no
one
was
more
prominent
and
capable
than
canning
it
became
one
of
the
prominent
influences
that
decided
his
future
course
as
he
always
affirmed
developing
his
talents
and
stimulating
his
mind
to
labor
in
this
honorable
way
it
also
exerted
a
decided
influence
upon
the
character
of
another
boy
named
frere
who
afterwards
shone
as
a
writer
on
the
pages
of
the
examples
of
industry
enterprise
despatch
promptness
punctuality
and
circumspection
are
inspiring
to
both
old
and
young
and
nowhere
do
these
noble
qualities
appear
to
better
advantage
than
they
do
where
busy
brains
and
hands
make
the
newspaper
in
the
printing
office
it
is
a
remarkably
useful
school
it
was
so
when
benjamin
was
a
boy
it
was
a
far
better
school
for
him
than
that
of
williams
or
brownwell
here
he
laid
the
foundation
of
his
learning
and
fame
the
same
was
true
of
horace
greeley
who
founded
the
york
and
of
henry
raymond
who
made
the
what
it
is
the
late
schuyler
colfax
was
schooled
in
a
printing
office
for
his
honorable
public
career
and
the
same
was
true
of
other
distinguished
statesmen
but
none
of
these
examples
are
so
remarkable
as
the
following
that
was
made
possible
by
benjamin
franklin
example
a
waif
two
years
of
age
was
taken
from
a
benevolent
institution
in
boston
and
given
to
a
childless
sailor
on
his
way
from
a
voyage
to
his
home
in
maine
on
the
penobscot
river
the
sailor
knew
not
from
what
institution
the
child
was
taken
nor
whence
he
came
he
carried
it
home
without
a
name
or
the
least
clue
to
his
ancestry
the
sailor
wife
was
a
christian
woman
and
had
prayed
for
just
such
a
gift
as
that
she
resolved
to
train
him
for
the
lord
at
twelve
years
of
age
he
became
a
christian
and
from
that
time
longed
to
be
a
minister
but
poverty
stood
in
his
way
and
there
was
little
prospect
of
his
hopes
being
realized
at
length
however
he
read
the
life
of
benjamin
franklin
and
he
learned
how
the
printing
office
introduced
him
into
a
noble
i
will
go
through
the
printing
office
into
the
ministry
he
said
to
his
adopted
mother
so
at
fifteen
he
became
a
printer
in
boston
after
a
while
his
health
broke
down
and
the
way
to
regain
it
seemed
to
be
through
service
to
a
wealthy
man
on
his
farm
in
the
country
there
his
health
was
restored
and
his
benevolent
employer
got
him
into
andover
academy
where
he
led
the
whole
class
near
the
close
of
his
preparatory
course
on
a
saturday
night
the
author
met
him
under
the
following
circumstances
he
was
then
nineteen
years
of
age
on
that
day
he
had
learned
from
what
institution
he
was
taken
and
going
thither
he
ascertained
that
he
had
a
sister
three
years
older
than
himself
living
thirty
miles
north
of
boston
it
was
the
first
knowledge
he
had
received
about
any
of
his
relatives
he
was
ten
years
old
when
his
adopted
parents
informed
him
that
he
was
taken
a
waif
from
an
institution
in
boston
from
that
time
he
was
curious
to
find
the
institution
and
learn
something
of
his
ancestry
he
was
too
young
when
he
was
taken
away
to
remember
that
he
had
a
sister
but
on
that
day
he
learned
the
fact
and
he
took
the
first
train
to
meet
her
the
author
took
the
train
also
to
spend
the
sabbath
with
the
minister
who
reared
the
sister
we
met
in
the
same
family
what
a
meeting
of
brother
and
sister
the
latter
had
mourned
through
all
these
years
that
she
knew
not
what
had
become
of
her
whom
she
well
remembered
and
loved
but
here
he
was
nineteen
years
of
age
a
manly
noble
christian
young
man
could
she
believe
her
eyes
could
we
who
were
lookers
on
think
it
real
we
received
the
story
of
his
life
from
his
own
lips
he
was
the
best
scholar
in
his
class
through
academy
college
and
theological
seminary
and
is
now
an
able
and
useful
minister
of
the
gospel
indebted
to
the
example
and
experience
of
benjamin
franklin
in
the
printing
office
for
what
he
is
xiii
books
of
his
boyhood
coleridge
divided
readers
into
four
classes
thus
the
first
may
be
compared
to
an
their
reading
being
as
the
sand
it
runs
in
and
it
runs
out
and
leaves
not
a
vestige
behind
a
second
class
resembles
a
sponge
which
imbibes
every
thing
and
returns
it
merely
in
the
same
state
only
a
little
dirtier
a
third
class
is
like
a
which
allows
all
that
is
pure
to
pass
away
and
retains
only
the
refuse
and
the
dregs
the
fourth
class
may
be
compared
to
the
slave
in
the
diamond
mines
of
golconda
who
casting
aside
all
that
is
worthless
preserves
only
the
pure
gem
benjamin
belonged
to
the
fourth
class
which
is
the
smallest
class
of
all
the
class
who
simply
let
what
they
read
run
in
and
run
out
is
very
large
it
is
not
entitled
to
much
respect
however
for
it
will
bring
no
more
to
pass
than
the
class
who
do
not
read
at
all
benjamin
sought
the
pure
gem
if
he
had
any
thing
he
wanted
diamonds
nor
did
he
accept
a
stone
for
bread
he
knew
what
bread
was
which
is
not
true
of
many
readers
and
so
he
had
bread
or
nothing
his
mind
was
a
voracious
eater
much
more
of
an
eater
than
his
body
it
demanded
substantial
food
too
the
bread
meat
and
potato
of
literature
and
science
it
did
not
crave
cake
and
confectionery
there
was
no
mincing
and
nibbling
when
it
went
to
a
meal
it
just
laid
in
as
if
to
shame
starvation
it
almost
gobbled
up
what
was
on
the
table
it
devoured
naturally
and
largely
it
was
fortunate
for
him
that
his
mind
was
so
hungry
all
the
time
otherwise
his
desire
to
go
to
sea
his
love
of
sport
and
his
unusual
social
qualities
might
have
led
him
astray
thousands
of
boys
have
been
ruined
in
this
way
whom
passionate
fondness
of
reading
might
have
made
useful
and
eminent
thomas
hood
said
a
natural
turn
for
reading
and
intellectual
pursuits
probably
preserved
me
from
the
moral
shipwrecks
so
apt
to
befall
those
who
are
deprived
in
early
life
of
their
parental
pilotage
my
books
kept
me
from
the
ring
the
the
tavern
and
saloon
the
closet
associate
of
pope
and
addison
the
mind
accustomed
to
the
noble
though
silent
discourse
of
shakespeare
and
milton
will
hardly
seek
or
put
up
with
that
sort
of
company
it
was
probably
as
true
of
benjamin
franklin
as
it
was
of
thomas
hood
that
reading
saved
him
from
a
career
of
worldliness
and
worthlessness
in
his
manhood
he
regarded
the
habit
in
this
light
and
said
from
my
infancy
i
was
passionately
fond
of
reading
and
all
the
money
that
came
into
my
hands
was
laid
out
in
the
purchasing
of
books
if
he
had
laid
out
his
money
in
billiards
boating
and
kindred
pleasures
as
so
many
do
he
might
have
been
known
in
manhood
as
ben
the
bruiser
instead
of
ben
the
statesman
and
philosopher
the
first
book
benjamin
read
was
bunyan
pilgrim
progress
he
was
fascinated
with
it
and
read
it
over
and
over
much
to
the
gratification
of
his
parents
what
is
there
about
it
that
interests
you
so
much
inquired
his
father
hoping
that
it
might
be
the
subject
alone
the
dialogues
that
are
carried
on
in
it
replied
benjamin
then
you
think
more
of
the
style
than
you
do
of
the
matter
remarked
his
father
evidently
somewhat
disappointed
that
he
was
not
specially
taken
with
christian
journey
it
is
all
interesting
i
should
never
get
tired
of
reading
such
a
book
this
reply
reassured
his
father
and
he
got
considerable
comfort
out
of
it
after
having
set
before
the
boy
the
true
idea
of
christian
flight
from
the
city
of
destruction
it
was
written
in
bedford
jail
england
continued
his
father
there
was
much
persecution
in
his
day
and
he
was
thrust
into
prison
to
keep
him
from
preaching
the
gospel
but
the
plan
did
not
succeed
very
well
for
he
has
been
preaching
it
ever
since
through
that
book
that
he
never
would
have
written
had
he
not
been
imprisoned
then
he
was
a
minister
was
he
said
benjamin
no
he
was
not
a
minister
he
was
a
tinker
and
a
very
wicked
man
so
profane
that
he
was
a
terror
to
good
people
but
he
was
converted
and
became
a
christian
and
went
about
doing
good
as
christ
did
preaching
the
gospel
in
his
way
in
houses
by
the
way
side
anywhere
that
he
could
until
he
was
sent
to
prison
for
doing
good
a
strange
reason
for
sending
a
man
to
jail
remarked
benjamin
they
thought
that
he
was
doing
evil
no
doubt
i
mean
the
enemies
of
the
gospel
they
did
not
believe
in
the
christian
religion
which
bunyan
had
embraced
they
thought
it
would
stir
up
the
people
to
strife
and
contention
and
prove
a
curse
instead
of
a
blessing
franklin
knew
that
such
information
would
increase
the
interest
of
his
son
in
the
book
and
it
did
the
impression
wrought
upon
him
by
reading
this
book
lasted
through
his
life
and
led
him
to
adopt
its
style
in
much
of
his
writing
when
he
became
a
man
he
said
in
manhood
narrative
mingled
with
dialogue
is
very
engaging
not
only
to
the
young
but
to
adults
also
it
introduces
the
reader
directly
into
the
company
and
he
listens
to
the
conversation
and
seems
to
see
the
parties
bunyan
originated
this
colloquial
style
and
defoe
and
richardson
were
his
imitators
it
is
a
style
so
attractive
conveying
instruction
so
naturally
and
pleasantly
that
it
should
never
be
superseded
franklin
owned
all
of
bunyan
works
his
grace
abounding
to
the
chief
of
sinners
and
his
holy
war
and
pilgrim
progress
just
spoken
of
benjamin
read
them
all
but
pilgrim
progress
was
the
one
that
charmed
his
soul
and
more
or
less
influenced
his
life
defoe
essay
upon
projects
was
another
volume
of
his
father
written
in
the
same
style
as
pilgrim
progress
and
for
that
reason
very
interesting
to
him
he
devoured
its
contents
its
was
much
above
the
capacity
of
most
boys
of
his
age
but
the
dialogue
method
of
imparting
instruction
made
it
clear
and
attractive
to
him
one
subject
which
it
advocated
was
the
liberal
education
of
girls
and
it
was
here
without
doubt
that
benjamin
obtained
his
views
upon
advanced
female
education
which
he
advocated
in
his
discussion
with
john
collins
plutarch
lives
was
still
another
volume
his
father
owned
one
of
the
most
inspiring
books
for
the
young
ever
published
he
read
this
so
much
and
carefully
that
he
was
made
very
familiar
with
the
characters
therein
information
that
was
of
great
service
to
him
later
on
in
his
literary
labors
and
public
services
there
was
another
book
in
my
father
little
library
by
doctor
mather
called
essay
to
do
good
said
doctor
franklin
in
his
autobiography
which
perhaps
gave
me
a
turn
of
thinking
that
had
an
influence
on
some
of
the
principal
future
events
of
my
life
he
wrote
to
a
son
of
doctor
mather
about
it
late
in
life
as
follows
when
i
was
a
boy
i
met
with
a
book
entitled
to
do
good
which
i
think
was
written
by
your
father
cotton
mather
it
had
been
so
little
regarded
by
a
former
possessor
that
several
leaves
of
it
were
torn
out
but
the
remainder
gave
me
such
a
turn
of
thinking
as
to
have
an
influence
on
my
conduct
through
life
for
i
have
always
set
a
greater
value
on
the
character
of
a
doer
of
good
than
on
any
other
kind
of
reputation
and
if
i
have
been
as
you
seem
to
think
a
useful
citizen
the
public
owe
the
advantage
of
it
to
that
book
the
essays
to
do
good
consisted
of
short
essays
of
a
practical
character
inculcating
benevolence
as
a
duty
and
privilege
and
giving
directions
to
particular
classes
it
had
lessons
for
ministers
lawyers
doctors
merchants
magistrates
teachers
mechanics
husbands
wives
gentlemen
deacons
and
others
the
style
was
quaint
earnest
and
direct
exactly
suited
to
appeal
to
such
a
boy
as
benjamin
and
withal
it
was
so
practical
that
it
won
his
heart
parton
records
a
singular
incident
about
this
doctor
mather
as
follows
how
exceedingly
strange
that
such
a
work
as
this
should
have
been
written
by
the
man
who
in
at
salem
when
nineteen
people
were
hanged
and
one
was
pressed
to
death
for
witchcraft
appeared
among
the
crowd
openly
exulting
in
the
spectacle
probably
his
zeal
against
the
witches
was
as
much
the
offspring
of
his
benevolence
as
his
to
do
good
concede
his
theory
of
witches
and
it
had
been
cruelty
to
man
not
to
hang
them
were
they
not
in
league
with
satan
the
of
god
and
man
had
they
not
bound
themselves
by
solemn
covenant
to
aid
the
devil
in
destroying
human
souls
and
afflicting
the
elect
cotton
mather
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
it
when
benjamin
had
exhausted
the
home
stock
of
reading
he
showed
his
sound
judgment
by
saying
to
his
father
i
wish
i
could
have
historical
collections
it
would
be
a
great
treat
to
read
those
books
it
would
indeed
they
are
very
popular
and
i
should
like
to
have
you
read
them
but
how
to
get
them
is
more
than
i
can
tell
would
you
be
willing
that
i
should
exchange
bunyan
works
for
them
i
did
not
suppose
that
you
would
part
with
progress
for
burton
books
or
any
others
was
franklin
reply
i
should
rather
keep
both
but
i
have
read
progress
until
i
know
it
by
heart
so
that
i
would
be
willing
to
part
with
it
for
burton
books
if
i
can
get
them
in
no
other
way
well
you
can
see
what
you
can
do
i
am
willing
to
do
any
thing
to
keep
you
in
good
books
for
they
are
good
companions
i
know
of
no
better
ones
from
all
i
have
heard
and
read
about
them
than
collections
perhaps
i
can
sell
bunyan
books
for
enough
to
buy
burton
suggested
benjamin
doubtless
he
had
canvassed
the
matter
and
knew
of
some
opportunity
for
a
trade
like
that
well
you
may
do
that
if
you
can
i
have
no
objection
i
hope
you
will
succeed
the
result
was
that
benjamin
sold
the
works
of
bunyan
and
bought
burton
books
in
forty
small
volumes
quite
a
little
library
for
that
day
he
was
never
happier
than
when
he
became
the
owner
of
historical
collections
famous
in
england
and
america
and
extensively
sold
not
only
by
but
also
by
pedlars
they
contained
fact
fiction
history
biography
travels
adventures
natural
history
and
an
account
of
many
marvels
curiosities
and
wonders
in
a
series
of
books
doctor
johnson
referred
to
these
books
in
one
of
his
letters
there
is
in
the
world
a
set
of
books
which
used
to
be
sold
by
the
on
the
bridge
and
which
i
must
entreat
you
to
procure
me
they
are
called
burton
books
the
title
of
one
is
curiosities
rarities
and
wonders
in
england
they
seem
very
proper
to
allure
backward
readers
he
might
have
added
also
readers
for
they
lured
benjamin
who
was
perhaps
the
most
thoughtful
and
ready
reader
of
his
age
in
boston
in
them
he
discovered
a
rich
mine
of
thought
and
information
and
he
delved
there
he
found
even
nuggets
of
gold
to
make
his
mind
richer
and
his
heart
gladder
his
father
books
were
chiefly
theological
yet
benjamin
love
of
reading
caused
him
to
read
them
he
possessed
also
a
collection
of
religious
tracts
called
the
boyle
lectures
because
robert
boyle
the
youngest
son
of
an
irish
earl
a
very
pious
man
originated
them
designed
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
among
infidels
benjamin
read
all
of
these
and
his
father
was
delighted
to
have
him
read
them
at
the
time
thinking
that
the
moral
results
would
be
good
but
the
sequel
will
show
that
the
effect
of
reading
them
was
bad
in
order
to
refute
the
arguments
of
deists
it
was
necessary
to
print
them
in
the
tracks
so
benjamin
read
both
sides
and
he
thought
in
some
respects
that
the
deists
had
the
best
argument
not
long
after
benjamin
became
a
printer
a
prominent
citizen
of
boston
matthew
adams
who
had
heard
of
his
talents
and
love
of
reading
met
him
in
the
printing
office
and
entered
into
conversation
with
him
you
are
a
great
reader
i
learn
he
said
yes
sir
i
read
considerable
every
day
do
you
find
all
the
books
you
want
to
read
not
all
i
should
like
to
read
some
books
i
ca
get
perhaps
you
can
find
them
in
my
library
you
can
come
and
take
out
of
it
any
book
you
would
like
thank
you
very
much
answered
benjamin
exceedingly
gratified
by
this
unexpected
offer
i
shall
take
the
first
opportunity
to
call
boys
who
like
to
read
as
well
as
you
do
ought
to
have
books
enough
continued
adams
i
think
you
will
find
quite
a
number
of
entertaining
and
useful
ones
you
will
know
when
you
examine
for
yourself
that
i
shall
do
very
soon
and
be
very
grateful
for
the
privilege
answered
benjamin
within
a
few
days
the
paid
adams
a
visit
the
latter
gave
him
a
cordial
welcome
causing
him
to
feel
at
ease
and
enjoy
his
call
he
examined
the
library
to
his
heart
content
and
found
many
books
therein
he
desired
to
read
come
any
time
take
out
any
and
all
the
books
you
please
and
keep
them
till
you
have
done
with
them
was
adams
generous
offer
he
had
great
interest
in
the
boy
and
wanted
to
assist
him
and
benjamin
fully
appreciated
his
interest
and
kindness
and
paid
the
library
many
visits
as
long
as
he
lived
he
never
forgot
the
generous
aid
of
this
man
of
whom
he
wrote
in
his
autobiography
after
some
time
a
merchant
an
ingenious
sensible
man
matthew
adams
who
had
a
pretty
collection
of
books
frequented
our
printing
office
took
notice
of
me
and
invited
me
to
see
his
library
and
very
kindly
proposed
to
lend
me
such
books
as
i
chose
to
read
the
printing
office
was
frequented
by
apprentices
whose
employers
wanted
jobs
of
printing
done
benjamin
made
their
acquaintance
and
they
invited
him
to
call
at
their
stores
to
examine
the
books
there
were
several
in
boston
at
that
time
although
the
number
of
books
was
very
limited
as
compared
with
the
present
time
i
will
lend
you
that
book
said
one
of
these
apprentices
to
benjamin
who
was
manifesting
a
deep
interest
in
a
certain
volume
you
can
return
it
in
the
morning
before
customers
come
in
very
much
obliged
i
shall
be
glad
to
read
it
i
think
i
can
read
it
through
before
i
go
to
bed
and
i
can
leave
it
when
i
go
to
the
office
in
the
morning
you
wo
have
much
time
for
sleep
if
you
read
that
book
through
before
going
to
bed
but
you
are
used
to
short
naps
i
expect
i
can
afford
to
have
a
short
nap
whenever
i
have
the
reading
of
such
a
book
as
this
answered
benjamin
i
shall
return
it
in
just
as
good
a
condition
as
it
is
now
the
book
is
for
sale
and
we
might
have
a
customer
for
it
or
i
would
let
you
have
it
longer
if
you
do
not
read
it
through
and
we
do
not
sell
it
you
can
take
it
again
night
i
frequently
read
a
volume
through
a
little
at
a
time
before
we
have
a
chance
to
sell
it
this
offer
of
the
apprentice
was
very
generous
and
benjamin
suitably
expressed
his
appreciation
of
it
your
favor
is
so
great
that
i
shall
feel
myself
under
special
obligation
to
return
the
book
in
season
for
any
customer
who
may
want
it
if
i
were
in
a
as
you
are
i
fear
that
my
love
of
reading
would
overcome
my
love
of
work
it
would
just
suit
me
to
be
in
the
company
of
so
many
books
all
the
time
you
could
not
have
your
evenings
here
for
reading
as
you
do
now
our
busiest
time
is
in
the
evening
so
that
i
catch
only
fragments
of
time
to
read
pretty
small
fragments
some
days
said
the
apprentice
well
it
might
be
only
an
aggravation
to
live
among
so
many
books
without
time
to
read
them
responded
benjamin
i
am
content
where
i
am
a
printing
office
has
some
advantages
over
all
other
places
for
me
benjamin
made
the
most
of
this
new
opportunity
borrowing
the
first
book
was
followed
by
borrowing
many
of
the
apprentices
at
the
all
the
stores
were
patronized
by
him
and
many
a
night
was
shortened
at
both
ends
that
he
might
devour
a
book
he
fairly
gorged
himself
with
the
reader
must
not
forget
that
books
were
very
few
in
number
at
that
time
and
it
was
long
before
a
public
library
was
known
in
the
land
in
boston
there
were
many
literary
people
who
had
come
hither
from
england
and
they
had
a
limited
supply
of
books
so
that
boston
was
then
better
supplied
with
books
than
any
other
part
of
the
country
though
its
supply
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
supply
now
instead
of
being
supplied
with
thousands
of
volumes
to
suit
every
taste
in
the
reading
world
offered
only
a
meagre
collection
of
volumes
such
as
would
be
scarcely
noticed
now
there
were
no
large
publishing
houses
issuing
a
new
book
each
of
the
year
as
there
are
at
the
present
time
manufacturing
hundreds
of
cords
of
them
every
year
and
sending
them
all
over
the
land
neither
were
there
any
libraries
then
as
we
have
before
said
now
the
public
library
of
boston
offers
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
volumes
free
to
all
the
citizens
and
that
number
is
constantly
increasing
with
the
athenaeum
and
other
large
libraries
for
public
use
boston
offers
a
million
volumes
from
which
the
poor
and
all
other
boys
can
make
their
choice
in
almost
every
town
too
of
two
thousand
inhabitants
a
public
library
is
opened
where
several
hundred
or
thousand
volumes
are
found
from
which
to
select
while
private
libraries
of
from
one
to
thirty
thousand
volumes
are
counted
by
the
score
the
trouble
with
boys
now
is
not
how
to
get
books
to
read
but
what
they
shall
select
from
the
vast
number
that
load
the
shelves
of
libraries
and
benjamin
had
no
trouble
about
selecting
books
he
took
all
he
could
get
and
was
not
overburdened
at
that
another
book
that
was
of
great
benefit
to
benjamin
was
an
old
english
grammar
which
he
bought
at
a
he
said
of
it
in
manhood
while
i
was
intent
on
improving
my
language
i
met
with
an
english
grammar
i
think
it
was
greenwood
having
at
the
end
of
it
two
little
sketches
on
the
arts
of
rhetoric
and
logic
the
latter
finishing
with
a
dispute
on
the
socratic
method
what
do
you
want
of
such
a
book
as
that
inquired
john
collins
when
he
saw
it
in
the
printing
office
to
study
of
course
i
did
not
study
grammar
at
school
and
i
want
to
know
something
about
it
was
benjamin
answer
i
expect
that
some
knowledge
of
it
will
not
come
amiss
said
john
you
mean
to
make
the
most
of
these
things
you
can
i
wanted
the
volume
too
for
the
chapters
on
rhetoric
and
logic
at
the
end
added
benjamin
of
what
use
are
rhetoric
and
logic
perhaps
they
may
be
of
service
to
you
they
would
not
be
to
me
john
spoke
thus
because
he
knew
nothing
about
them
he
had
never
studied
them
every
body
ought
to
know
something
about
them
even
a
printer
added
benjamin
they
have
already
helped
me
to
form
a
better
opinion
of
the
style
and
value
of
some
things
i
have
read
well
i
ca
get
time
to
learn
every
thing
you
seem
to
learn
all
there
is
to
learn
with
very
little
time
i
wish
i
could
but
i
ca
and
so
i
wo
try
john
was
always
thus
complimentary
to
benjamin
he
gave
him
full
credit
for
all
his
achievements
i
mean
to
learn
to
speak
and
write
the
english
language
with
propriety
continued
benjamin
and
i
do
not
know
how
it
can
be
done
without
a
knowledge
of
grammar
do
you
i
know
nothing
about
it
any
way
whatever
i
shall
not
begin
now
am
too
old
ca
teach
old
dogs
new
tricks
john
remark
expressed
his
real
views
of
these
things
although
he
was
a
bookish
fellow
he
was
not
inclined
to
go
deep
into
literature
or
science
other
books
that
benjamin
read
were
locke
essay
on
the
understanding
the
art
of
thinking
by
de
sellers
stumey
book
on
navigation
with
many
others
of
equal
merit
benjamin
cultivated
the
habit
of
taking
notes
when
he
read
jotting
down
notable
facts
and
striking
thoughts
for
future
use
it
is
a
capital
practice
and
one
that
has
been
followed
by
nearly
all
learners
who
have
distinguished
themselves
in
scholarship
he
realized
the
advantages
of
the
method
to
such
a
degree
that
in
manhood
he
addressed
the
following
letter
from
london
to
a
bright
girl
in
whose
education
he
was
very
much
interested
craven
street
may
i
send
my
good
girl
the
books
i
mentioned
to
her
last
night
i
beg
her
to
accept
of
them
as
a
small
mark
of
my
esteem
and
friendship
they
are
written
in
the
familiar
easy
manner
for
which
the
french
are
so
remarkable
and
afford
a
good
deal
of
philosophic
and
practical
knowledge
unembarrassed
with
the
dry
mathematics
used
by
more
exact
reasoners
but
which
is
apt
to
discourage
young
beginners
i
would
advise
you
to
read
with
a
pen
in
your
hand
and
enter
in
a
little
book
short
hints
of
what
you
find
that
is
curious
or
that
may
be
useful
for
this
will
be
the
best
method
of
imprinting
such
particulars
in
your
memory
where
they
will
be
ready
either
for
practice
on
some
future
occasion
if
they
are
matters
of
utility
or
at
least
to
adorn
and
improve
your
conversation
if
they
are
rather
points
of
curiosity
and
as
many
of
the
terms
of
science
are
such
as
you
can
not
have
met
with
in
your
common
reading
and
may
therefore
be
unacquainted
with
i
think
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
have
a
good
dictionary
at
hand
to
consult
immediately
when
you
meet
with
a
word
you
do
not
comprehend
the
precise
meaning
of
this
may
at
first
seem
troublesome
and
interrupting
but
it
is
a
trouble
that
will
daily
diminish
as
you
will
daily
find
less
and
less
occasion
for
your
dictionary
as
you
become
more
acquainted
with
the
terms
and
in
the
mean
time
you
will
read
with
more
satisfaction
because
with
more
understanding
when
any
point
occurs
in
which
you
would
be
glad
to
have
further
information
than
your
book
affords
you
i
beg
you
would
not
in
the
least
apprehend
that
i
should
think
it
a
trouble
to
receive
and
answer
your
questions
it
will
be
a
pleasure
and
no
trouble
for
though
i
may
not
be
able
out
of
my
own
little
stock
of
knowledge
to
afford
you
what
you
require
i
can
easily
direct
you
to
the
books
where
it
may
most
readily
be
found
adieu
and
believe
me
ever
my
dear

reading
with

or
pencil
in
hand
fixes
the
attention
assists
method
strengthens
purpose
and
charges
memory
with
its
sacred
trust
a
for
this
purpose
is
the
most
convenient
method
of
preserving
these
treasures
professor
atkinson
of
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
advises
students
thus
gather
up
the
scraps
and
fragments
of
thought
on
whatever
subject
you
may
be
studying
for
of
course
by
a
i
do
not
mean
a
mere
receptacle
for
odds
and
ends
a
literary
but
acquire
the
habit
of
gathering
every
thing
whenever
and
wherever
you
find
it
that
belongs
in
your
lines
of
study
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
how
such
fragments
will
arrange
themselves
into
an
orderly
whole
by
the
very
organizing
power
of
your
own
thinking
acting
in
a
definite
direction
this
is
a
true
process
of
but
you
see
it
is
no
mechanical
process
of
mere
aggregation
it
requires
activity
of
thought
but
without
that
what
is
any
reading
but
mere
passive
amusement
and
it
requires
method
i
have
myself
a
sort
of
literary
bookkeeping
i
keep
a
and
at
my
leisure
i
post
my
literary
accounts
bringing
together
in
proper
groups
the
fruits
of
much
casual
reading
the
late

garfield
began
this
method
when
he
began
to
study
with
a
view
to
a
liberal
education
at
about
seventeen
years
of
age
he
continued
it
as
long
as
he
lived
his
notes
and
references
including
filled
several
volumes
before
his
congressional
career
closed
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
a
large
number
of
books
in
addition
to
those
in
his
own
library
were
made
available
in
this
way
it
was
said
that
his
notes
were
of
great
service
to
him
in
congress
in
the
discussion
of
almost
any
public
question

from
the
above
date
when
benjamin
did
not
indulge
to
some
extent
his
inclination
to
write
it
was
done
for
his
own
amusement
and
profit
so
that
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
showing
or
speaking
of
his
productions
none
of
them
were
preserved
but
his
talent
for
composition
developed
rapidly
from
the
time
he
was
fairly
settled
in
the
printing
business
he
practised
putting
original
thoughts
and
thoughts
culled
from
books
into
sentences
and
paragraphs
a
very
sensible
method
of
he
often
tried
his
hand
at
poetry
if
it
was
only
a
couplet
at
a
time
longer
compositions
he
wrote
for
no
one
to
see
and
read
but
himself
one
day
his
brother
james
curious
to
see
what
benjamin
was
writing
so
much
about
looked
over
his
shoulder
what
have
you
there
ben
he
said
writing
a
sermon
or
your
will
ay
poetry
is
it
catching
a
glimpse
of
it
then
you
are
a
poet
are
you
seeing
what
i
can
do
benjamin
replied
we
do
not
know
what
we
can
do
till
we
try
it
is
not
much
any
way
let
me
read
it
and
i
will
tell
you
whether
it
is
much
or
not
authors
are
not
good
judges
of
their
own
productions
they
are
like
parents
who
think
their
own
children
handsomest
and
most
promising
they
think
their
articles
are
better
than
they
are
james
was
in
a
happy
mood
for
him
when
he
thus
spoke
he
knew
nothing
about
benjamin
ability
in
writing
composition
for
this
was
quite
a
while
before
the
newspaper
was
started
for
which
he
wrote
i
have
been
reading
much
poetry
of
late
added
benjamin
and
i
am
anxious
to
know
if
i
can
write
it
i
like
to
read
it
and
i
have
read
several
of
the
poets
since
i
had
access
to
adams
library
this
was
after
adams
invited
him
take
books
from
his
library
of
which
we
have
already
given
an
account
so
much
the
more
reason
that
i
should
read
what
you
have
written
added
james
i
do
not
expect
it
will
be
quite
equal
to
shakespeare
well
read
it
i
do
not
care
and
benjamin
passed
it
over
to
his
brother
without
further
hesitation
james
read
it
over
carefully
and
then
he
it
before
making
a
remark
as
if
to
be
sure
that
he
was
not
mistaken
in
the
quality
of
the
composition
that
is
good
ben
it
is
really
good
much
better
than
i
supposed
you
could
write
indeed
i
did
not
know
that
you
could
write
poetry
at
all
it
is
not
quite
equal
to
virgil
or
homer
but
good
for
a
to
write
have
you
any
other
pieces
james
was
honest
in
these
last
remarks
and
felt
more
kindly
at
the
time
than
he
often
did
towards
his
brother
yes
i
have
two
or
three
pieces
more
which
i
am
going
to
improve
somewhat
you
had
better
wait
till
i
have
rewritten
them
before
you
read
them
benjamin
was
greatly
encouraged
by
his
brother
favorable
opinion
of
his
literary
venture
when
he
made
this
reply
no
need
of
that
let
me
see
them
now
and
i
can
tell
you
whether
they
are
worth
making
better
some
things
are
not
worth
making
better
and
i
think
this
must
be
particularly
true
of
poetry
poor
poetry
is
poor
stuff
better
write
new
than
to
try
to
improve
it
james
last
plea
prevailed
and
benjamin
produced
the
articles
for
his
examination
they
were
read
with
as
much
interest
as
the
first
one
and
they
were
too
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
in
his
judgment
then
his
enthusiasm
broke
out
i
tell
you
what
it
is
ben
these
are
good
and
i
believe
that
you
can
write
something
worthy
of
print
if
you
try
hard
and
if
you
will
undertake
it
you
may
print
and
sell
a
sheet
on
the
street
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
will
sell
well
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
benjamin
replied
very
much
elated
over
his
success
i
hardly
think
my
poetry
will
read
well
in
print
though
i
have
not
been
writing
for
the
press
we
can
tell
best
when
we
read
it
in
print
get
up
something
as
soon
as
you
can
and
let
us
see
said
james
i
will
go
right
about
it
and
i
will
not
be
long
in
getting
up
something
good
bad
or
indifferent
within
a
few
days
benjamin
produced
two
street
ballads
after
the
style
of
that
day
they
were
better
than
any
thing
he
had
written
but
still
susceptible
of
great
improvement
one
was
entitled
the
tragedy
and
was
founded
on
the
shipwreck
of
captain
worthilake
and
his
two
daughters
the
other
was
a
sailor
song
on
the
capture
of
the
famous
or
blackbeard
the
pirate
james
read
them
critically
to
see
if
it
would
do
to
put
them
in
print
and
offer
them
to
the
public
these
are
really
better
than
what
i
read
the
other
day
he
remarked
when
he
had
examined
them
all
he
desired
now
you
may
put
them
into
type
and
sell
them
about
the
town
if
you
are
willing
i
think
a
good
number
of
them
may
be
disposed
of
how
many
copies
will
you
print
we
can
print
a
few
to
begin
with
and
let
the
type
remain
standing
until
we
see
how
they
go
then
we
shall
run
no
risk
shall
i
do
it
immediately
just
as
soon
as
you
can
the
quicker
the
better
i
am
anxious
to
see
how
they
take
with
the
public
benjamin
was
not
long
in
printing
the
two
ballads
and
having
them
ready
for
sale
under
the
direction
of
his
brother
he
went
forth
in
due
time
to
offer
them
about
the
town
whether
he
cried
them
on
the
streets
as
the
newsboys
do
the
daily
papers
now
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
but
he
was
successful
in
selling
his
wares
whatever
his
method
was
the
tragedy
sold
the
most
readily
that
commemorated
an
event
of
recent
occurrence
and
which
excited
much
public
feeling
and
sympathy
at
the
time
so
that
people
were
quite
prepared
to
purchase
it
it
sold
even
beyond
his
expectations
and
seemed
to
develop
what
little
vanity
there
was
in
his
soul
he
began
to
think
that
he
was
a
genuine
born
poet
and
that
distinction
and
a
fortune
were
before
him
if
he
had
not
been
confronted
by
his
father
on
the
subject
it
is
possible
that
the
speculation
might
have
proved
a
serious
injury
to
him
but
franklin
learned
of
his
enterprise
and
called
him
to
an
account
perhaps
he
stepped
into
his
shop
as
he
was
selling
them
about
town
and
gave
him
a
copy
whether
so
or
not
his
father
learned
of
the
fact
and
the
following
interview
will
show
what
he
thought
of
it
i
am
ashamed
to
see
you
engaged
in
such
a
business
benjamin
it
is
unworthy
of
a
son
of
josiah
franklin
why
so
father
i
ca
understand
you
because
it
is
not
an
honorable
business
you
are
not
a
poet
and
can
write
nothing
of
that
sort
worth
printing
james
approved
of
the
pieces
and
proposed
that
i
should
print
and
sell
them
benjamin
pleaded
james
is
not
a
good
judge
of
poetry
nor
of
the
propriety
of
hawking
them
about
town
it
is
wretched
stuff
and
i
am
ashamed
that
you
are
known
as
the
author
look
here
let
me
show
you
wherein
it
is
defective
benjamin
was
so
dumbfounded
that
he
could
not
say
much
in
reply
and
his
father
proceeded
to
expose
the
faults
of
the
poetical
effusion
he
did
not
spare
the
young
author
at
all
nor
was
he
cautious
and
lenient
in
his
criticisms
on
the
other
hand
he
was
severe
and
he
went
on
until
benjamin
began
to
feel
sorry
that
he
had
ever
written
a
scrap
of
poetry
there
i
want
you
should
promise
me
continued
his
father
that
you
will
never
deal
in
such
wares
again
and
that
you
will
stick
to
your
business
of
setting
up
type
perhaps
i
may
improve
by
practice
suggested
benjamin
whose
estimation
of
his
literary
venture
was
modified
considerably
by
this
time
perhaps
i
may
yet
write
something
worthy
of
being
read
you
could
not
expect
me
to
write
like
pope
to
begin
with
no
nor
to
end
with
retorted
his
father
you
are
not
a
poet
and
there
is
no
use
in
your
trying
to
be
perhaps
you
can
learn
to
write
prose
well
but
poetry
is
another
thing
even
if
you
were
a
poet
i
should
advise
you
to
let
the
business
alone
for
poets
are
usually
beggars
poor
shiftless
members
of
society
that
is
news
to
me
responded
benjamin
how
does
it
happen
then
that
some
of
their
works
are
so
popular
because
a
true
poet
can
write
something
worthy
of
being
read
while
a
mere
like
yourself
writes
only
doggerel
that
is
not
worth
the
paper
on
which
it
was
printed
now
i
advise
you
to
let
alone
and
attend
closely
to
your
business
both
for
your
own
sake
and
your
brother
franklin
was
rather
severe
upon
his
son
although
what
he
said
of
his
verses
was
substantially
true
as
his
son
freely
admitted
in
manhood
he
overlooked
the
important
fact
that
it
was
a
commendable
effort
of
the
boy
to
try
to
improve
his
mind
some
of
the
best
poets
who
have
lived
wrote
mere
doggerel
when
they
began
also
many
of
our
best
prose
writers
were
exceedingly
faulty
at
first
it
is
a
noble
effort
for
a
boy
to
put
his
thoughts
into
language
and
franklin
ought
to
have
recognized
it
as
such
if
he
does
not
succeed
in
the
first
instance
by
patience
industry
and
perseverance
he
may
triumph
at
last
benjamin
might
not
have
acted
wisely
in
selling
his
verses
about
town
but
his
brother
so
much
older
and
more
experienced
than
himself
should
have
borne
the
censure
of
that
since
it
was
done
by
his
direction
doubtless
his
brother
regarded
the
propriety
of
the
act
less
because
he
had
an
eye
on
the
pecuniary
profits
of
the
scheme
the
decided
opposition
that
franklin
showed
to
put
a
damper
upon
benjamin
poetic
aspirations
the
that
his
youthful
imagination
had
built
in
consequence
of
the
rapid
sale
of
his
wares
tumbled
in
ruins
he
went
back
to
the
office
and
his
work
quite
crestfallen
the
reader
must
bear
in
mind
that
this
incident
occurred
before
the
discussion
of
benjamin
with
john
collins
upon
female
education
related
in
a
former
chapter
we
shall
see
that
his
father
criticisms
on
his
arguments
in
that
discussion
proved
of
great
value
to
him
what
has
happened
now
ben
inquired
james
observing
that
his
brother
looked
despondent
and
anxious
are
you
bringing
forth
more
poetry
father
does
think
much
of
my
printing
and
selling
verses
of
my
own
answered
benjamin
he
has
given
me
such
a
lecture
that
i
am
almost
ashamed
of
myself
how
is
that
do
he
think
they
are
worthy
of
print
no
he
do
not
see
any
merit
in
them
at
all
he
read
them
over
in
his
way
and
counted
faults
enough
to
show
that
there
is
precious
little
poetry
in
me
a
beggar
and
a
poet
mean
about
the
same
thing
to
him
he
ought
to
remember
that
you
are
not
as
old
as
you
will
be
if
you
live
and
you
will
make
improvement
from
year
to
year
you
expect
to
write
either
prose
or
verse
well
without
beginning
and
trying
all
the
trial
in
the
world
can
do
nothing
for
me
i
should
judge
from
father
talk
you
ought
to
have
heard
him
and
he
did
not
spare
you
for
suggesting
the
printing
and
sale
of
the
pieces
on
the
street
benjamin
said
this
in
a
tone
of
bitter
disappointment
well
i
suppose
that
he
has
heard
of
two
men
disagreeing
on
a
matter
remarked
james
all
is
he
and
i
do
not
agree
i
consider
the
whole
thing
wise
and
proper
and
he
does
not
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
perhaps
it
was
a
good
thing
for
benjamin
to
meet
with
this
obstacle
in
his
path
to
success
rather
discouraging
it
is
true
nevertheless
suited
to
keep
him
humble
benjamin
confessed
in
manhood
that
his
vanity
was
inflated
by
the
sale
of
his
ballads
and
he
might
have
been
puffed
up
to
his
future
injury
had
not
his
father
thus
unceremoniously
taken
the
wind
out
of
his
sails
that
removed
the
danger
after
such
a
severe
handling
he
was
not
inclined
to
his
poetical
talents
it
had
the
effect
also
to
turn
his
attention
almost
wholly
to
prose
writing
in
which
he
became
distinguished
as
we
shall
see
hereafter
a
single
verse
of
these
ballads
only
has
descended
to
our
times
it
is
from
the
second
mentioned
the
capture
of
the
pirate
as
follows
come
all
you
jolly
sailors
you
all
so
stout
and
brave
come
hearken
and
i
tell
you
what
happened
on
the
wave
oh
is
of
that
bloody
blackbeard
i
going
now
to
tell
how
as
to
gallant
maynard
he
soon
was
sent
to
hell
with
a
down
down
down
derry
down
franklin
said
of
this
ballad
episode
i
now
took
a
strong
inclination
for
poetry
and
wrote
some
little
pieces
my
brother
supposing
it
might
turn
to
account
encouraged
me
and
induced
me
to
compose
two
occasional
ballads
one
was
called
tragedy
and
contained
an
account
of
the
shipwreck
of
captain
worthilake
with
his
two
daughters
the
other
was
a
song
on
taking
the
famous
or
the
pirate
they
were
wretched
stuff
in
style
and
when
they
were
printed
my
brother
sent
me
about
the
town
selling
them
the
first
sold
prodigiously
the
event
being
recent
and
having
made
a
great
noise
this
success
flattered
my
vanity
but
my
father
discouraged
me
by
criticising
my
performances
and
telling
me
that
were
generally
beggars
thus
i
escaped
being
a
poet
and
probably
a
very
bad
one
from
the
time
that
franklin
criticised
his
son
argument
with
john
collins
on
female
education
benjamin
made
special
efforts
to
improve
his
style
he
knew
that
addison
style
was
regarded
as
a
model
so
he
purchased
an
old
volume
of
his
and
set
himself
to
work
with
a
determination
to
make
his
own
style
addisonian
he
subjected
himself
to
the
severest
test
in
order
to
improve
and
counted
nothing
too
hard
if
he
could
advance
toward
that
standard
his
own
account
of
his
perseverance
and
industry
in
studying
his
model
as
it
appears
in
his
autobiography
will
best
present
the
facts
about
this
time
i
met
with
an
odd
volume
of
the
i
had
never
before
seen
any
of
them
i
bought
it
read
it
over
and
over
and
was
much
delighted
with
it
i
thought
the
writing
excellent
and
wished
if
possible
to
imitate
it
with
that
view
i
took
some
of
the
papers
and
making
short
hints
of
the
sentiments
in
each
sentence
laid
them
by
a
few
days
and
then
without
looking
at
the
book
tried
to
complete
the
papers
again
by
expressing
each
hinted
sentiment
at
length
and
as
fully
as
it
had
been
expressed
before
in
any
suitable
words
that
should
occur
to
me
then
i
compared
my
spectator
with
the
original
discovered
some
of
my
faults
and
corrected
them
but
i
found
that
i
wanted
a
stock
of
words
or
readiness
in
recollecting
and
using
them
which
i
thought
i
should
have
acquired
before
that
time
if
i
had
gone
on
making
verses
since
the
continual
search
for
words
of
the
same
import
but
of
different
length
to
suit
the
measure
or
of
different
sound
for
the
rhyme
would
have
laid
me
under
a
constant
necessity
of
searching
for
variety
and
also
have
tended
to
fix
that
variety
in
my
mind
and
make
me
master
of
it
therefore
i
took
some
of
the
tales
in
the
and
turned
them
into
verse
and
after
a
time
when
i
had
pretty
well
forgotten
the
prose
turned
them
back
again
i
also
sometimes
jumbled
my
collection
of
hints
into
confusion
and
after
some
weeks
endeavored
to
reduce
them
into
the
best
order
before
i
began
to
form
the
full
sentences
and
complete
the
subject
this
was
to
teach
me
method
in
the
arrangement
of
the
thoughts
by
comparing
my
work
with
the
original
i
discovered
many
faults
and
corrected
them
but
i
sometimes
had
the
pleasure
to
fancy
that
in
certain
particulars
of
small
consequence
i
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
improve
the
method
or
the
language
and
this
encouraged
me
to
think
that
i
might
in
time
come
to
be
a
tolerable
english
writer
of
which
i
was
extremely
ambitious
the
time
i
allotted
for
writing
exercises
and
for
reading
was
at
night
or
before
work
began
in
the
morning
or
on
sundays
when
i
contrived
to
be
in
the
printing
house
avoiding
as
much
as
i
could
the
constant
attendance
at
public
worship
which
my
father
used
to
exact
of
me
when
i
was
under
his
care
and
which
i
still
continued
to
consider
a
duty
though
i
could
not
afford
time
to
practise
it
let
any
boy
of
even
moderate
abilities
subject
himself
to
such
rigid
discipline
for
intellectual
improvement
as
benjamin
did
and
his
progress
will
be
rapid
and
his
attainments
remarkable
such
application
and
persistent
effort
win
always
in
a
similar
manner
benjamin
acquired
the
socratic
method
of
reasoning
which
he
found
at
the
end
of
the
english
grammar
that
he
studied
subsequently
he
purchased
xenophon
memorabilia
because
it
would
afford
him
assistance
in
acquiring
the
socratic
style
he
committed
to
memory
wrote
practised
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
persevering
overcoming
conquering
he
acquired
the
method
so
thoroughly
as
to
be
expert
therein
and
practised
it
with
great
satisfaction
to
himself
many
years
thereafter
he
spoke
of
the
fact
as
follows
while
i
was
intent
on
improving
my
language
i
met
with
an
english
grammar
i
think
it
was
greenwood
having
at
the
end
of
it
two
little
sketches
on
the
arts
of
rhetoric
and
logic
the
latter
finishing
with
a
dispute
in
the
socratic
method
and
soon
after
i
procured
xenophon
things
of
socrates
wherein
there
are
many
examples
of
the
same
method
i
was
charmed
with
it
adopted
it
dropped
my
abrupt
contradiction
and
positive
argumentation
and
put
on
the
humble
inquirer
and
being
then
from
reading
shaftesbury
and
collins
made
a
doubter
as
i
already
was
in
many
points
of
our
religious
doctrines
i
found
this
method
the
safest
for
myself
and
very
embarrassing
to
those
against
whom
i
used
it
therefore
i
took
delight
in
it
practised
it
continually
and
grew
very
artful
and
expert
in
drawing
people
even
of
superior
knowledge
into
concessions
the
consequences
of
which
they
did
not
foresee
entangling
them
in
difficulties
out
of
which
they
could
not
extricate
themselves
and
so
obtaining
victories
that
neither
myself
nor
my
cause
always
deserved
i
continued
this
method
some
few
years
but
gradually
left
it
retaining
only
the
habit
of
expressing
myself
in
terms
of
modest
diffidence
never
using
when
i
advanced
any
thing
that
may
possibly
be
disputed
the
words
or
any
others
that
give
the
air
of
positiveness
to
an
opinion
but
rather
saying
or
a
thing
to
be
so
and
so
appears
to
or
should
not
think
it
so
or
so
for
such
and
such
or
imagine
it
to
be
or
is
so
if
i
am
not
this
habit
i
believe
has
been
of
great
advantage
to
me
when
i
have
had
occasion
to
inculcate
my
opinions
and
persuade
men
into
measures
that
i
have
been
from
time
to
time
engaged
in
promoting
this
and
the
preceding
chapter
show
that
a
book
may
decide
the
future
character
and
destiny
of
a
man
by
inspiring
thought
kindling
ambition
and
a
lofty
aim
stimulating
the
mental
powers
inspiring
practical
and
perhaps
elegant
composition
and
consecrating
the
whole
being
to
a
definite
purpose
all
this
was
true

that
the
imitation

determined

and
character
henry

made
a
missionary
by
reading
the
lives
of

and
carey

read
telemachus
in
his
youth
and
many
years
afterwards
he
said
that
romance
may
be
regarded
as
the
of
my
whole
character
goethe
became
a
poet
in
consequence
of
reading
the
vicar
of

in

soul
that
impelled
him
forward
and
gave
direction
to
his
life
the
national
system
of
education
in
great
britain
grew
out
of
a
book
joseph
lancastar
read
clarkson
on
the
slave
trade
when
he
was
fourteen
years
of
age
and
it
awakened
his
enthusiasm
to
teach
the
blacks
in
the
west
indies
without
the
knowledge
of
his
parents
he
went
thither
and
commenced
labors
for
their
mental
and
moral
improvement
his
parents
learned
where
he
was
and
sent
for
him
but
his
heart
was
thoroughly
in
sympathy
with
benevolent
work
and
he
opened
a
school
for
the
poor
at
home
so
great
was
his
success
that
the
town
after
a
few
years
erected
a
commodious
building
for
his
school
and
here
was
the
foundation
of
the
present
system
of
education
in
the
the
author
once
advised
a
youth
of
fourteen
to
read
certain
books
accustoming
himself
to
write
down
in
a
striking
facts
and
thoughts
for
preservation
at
the
same
time
he
was
advised
to
procure
a
blank
book
and
write
therein
a
sentence
or
short
paragraph
each
day
without
omission
the
sentence
or
paragraph
to
contain
the
development
of
some
thought
that
was
waiting
utterance
at
that
time
there
was
no
prospect
that
the
youth
would
ever
receive
a
liberal
education
he
was
a
farmer
son
and
his
father
was
unable
to
educate
him
the
most
the
author
had
in
view
was
to
provide
him
a
bright
active
promising
boy
fond
of
reading
with
a
source
of
improving
entertainment
and
profit
but
he
caught
the
idea
with
so
much
enthusiasm
and
reduced
it
to
practice
so
thoroughly
that
an
unquenchable
desire
for
an
education
was
nursed
into
controlling
power
and
he
went
through
college
studied
theology
became
pastor
of
one
of
the
largest
congregational
churches
in
the
country
stood
among
the
most
eloquent
preachers
in
the
land
at
thirty
received
the
degree
of
doctor
of
divinity
at
forty
and
now
at
a
little
more
than
fifty
is
the
beloved
and
able
pastor
of
a
large
church
in
a
new
england
city
this
result
was
brought
about
by
the
discipline
of
reading
and
writing
in
his
youth
very
similar
to
that
which
made
benjamin
a
statesman
and
philosopher
xv
the
courant
in
trouble
the
legislature
is
calling
you
to
an
account
said
a
customer
to
james
franklin
as
he
entered
the
office
the
officials
ca
put
up
with
your
cutting
criticisms
i
am
aware
of
that
i
heard
that
they
were
going
to
haul
the
over
the
coals
but
i
do
not
see
what
they
can
do
about
it
they
can
stop
your
printing
it
i
suppose
it
would
be
an
intolerant
act
of
course
but
governments
have
never
been
tolerant
towards
the
press
you
know
the
day
is
coming
when
they
will
be
responded
james
a
free
press
is
indispensable
to
human
progress
so
long
as
i
run
the
it
shall
speak
plainly
of
intolerance
and
hypocrisy
of
every
form
i
shall
hit
the
corruption
of
the
times
in
high
places
or
low
that
is
sound
doctrine
replied
the
customer
i
endorse
it
but
government
officials
do
not
they
feel
very
sore
and
will
make
trouble
for
you
if
they
can
at
that
moment
benjamin
came
rushing
into
the
office
under
considerable
excitement
the
assembly
are
having
a
hot
debate
over
the
he
said
i
heard
a
gentleman
say
that
they
would
stop
the
publication
of
the
paper
if
possible
perhaps
they
will
but
i
doubt
it
replied
james
the
will
not
be
muzzled
so
long
as
i
own
it
it
ought
not
to
be
responded
the
customer
we
need
an
outspoken
paper
that
will
rebuke
corruption
and
shams
everywhere
and
that
is
all
the
trouble
said
benjamin
that
is
what
the
assembly
and
the
ministers
denounce
they
are
better
friends
of
the
british
government
than
they
are
of
the
colony
of
massachusetts
bay
true
very
true
rejoined
the
customer
the
tyrannical
control
of
the
english
press
is
a
shame
and
yet
these
officials
who
truckle
to
the
english
government
want
to
try
it
on
here
but
such
intolerance
ought
not
to
be
borne
the
was
exceedingly
sarcastic
and
no
writer
was
more
so
than
benjamin
young
as
he
was
this
was
the
real
cause
of
the
action
of
the
assembly
a
letter
appeared
in
the
justly
rebuking
the
government
for
dilatoriness
in
looking
after
a
piratical
craft
off
block
island
the
letter
purported
to
come
from
newport
and
represented
that
the
colony
were
fitting
out
two
vessels
to
capture
her
it
concluded
thus
we
are
advised
from
boston
that
the
government
of
the
massachusetts
are
fitting
out
a
ship
the
to
go
after
the
pirates
to
be
commanded
by
capt
peter
papillon
and
it
is
thought
he
will
sail
sometime
this
month
wind
and
weather
permitting
this
thrust
at
the
government
for
tardiness
would
be
regarded
as
a
good
joke
now
but
it
was
a
crime
then
and
the
aristocracy
of
the
province
always
working
in
harmony
with
the
king
and
parliament
was
stirred
up
by
it
to
intolerance
james
was
summoned
before
the
council
and
his
apprentice
also
both
of
whom
stood
upon
their
dignity
refusing
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
put
benjamin
was
dismissed
because
it
was
found
that
he
was
only
an
apprentice
but
james
was
put
on
trial
and
pelted
with
questions
the
legislators
were
determined
to
find
out
who
wrote
the
scurrilous
article
aforesaid
as
they
called
it
but
james
refused
to
tell
he
placed
himself
squarely
upon
his
personal
rights
as
a
citizen
and
heroically
stood
by
his
guns
come
what
might
he
resolved
to
defend
his
course
before
this
august
tribunal
the
council
became
more
exasperated
by
his
defiant
spirit
and
threatened
him
with
incarceration
but
james
stood
his
ground
like
a
martyr
without
thinking
he
would
soon
become
one
benjamin
was
equally
defiant
and
refused
to
answer
some
questions
but
was
excused
on
the
ground
that
an
apprentice
was
bound
not
to
betray
his
secrets
james
was
convicted
of
a
high
affront
to
the
government
and
the
sheriff
was
directed
to
commit
him
to
the
boston
jail
these
new
quarters
were
unexpected
to
him
but
he
went
thither
with
the
consciousness
that
he
was
suffering
for
a
brave
effort
to
correct
public
wrongs
we
have
called
attention
to
a
single
paragraph
reflecting
upon
the
government
in
the
it
should
be
told
that
such
criticisms
were
frequent
in
its
columns
the
governor
council
and
nearly
all
the
ruling
class
of
the
province
were
in
full
sympathy
with
great
britain
while
others
were
restive
under
what
they
regarded
as
oppressive
rule
most
of
the
ministers
belonged
to
the
first
class
and
so
came
in
for
a
share
of
the
sarcastic
utterances
the
represented
the
second
class
the
common
people
who
read
its
columns
gladly
cotton
mather
attacked
the
paper
in
a
paragraph
that
shows
what
the
paper
contained
we
find
a
notorious
scandalous
paper
called
full
freighted
with
nonsense
unmanliness
raillery
profaneness
immorality
arrogance
calumnies
lies
contradictions
and
what
not
all
tending
to
quarrels
and
divisions
and
to
debauch
and
corrupt
the
mind
and
manners
of
new
england
increase
mather
also
assailed
the
over
his
own
signature
denouncing
it
as
a
wicked
libel
because
it
represented
him
as
one
of
its
supporters
using
language
uncommonly
expressive
i
do
hereby
declare
he
said
that
although
i
had
paid
for
two
or
three
of
them
i
sent
him
word
i
was
extremely
offended
with
it
in
special
because
in
one
of
his
he
insinuates
that
if
a
of
god
approve
of
a
thing
it
is
a
sign
it
is
of
the
which
is
a
horrid
thing
to
be
related
and
he
doth
frequently
abuse
the
ministers
of
religion
and
many
other
worthy
persons
in
a
manner
which
is
intolerable
for
these
and
such
like
reasons
i
signified
to
the
printer
that
i
would
have
no
more
of
their
i
that
have
known
what
new
england
was
from
the
beginning
can
not
but
be
troubled
to
see
the
degeneracy
of
this
place
i
can
well
remember
when
the
civil
government
would
have
taken
an
effectual
course
to
suppress
such
a
which
if
it
be
not
done
i
am
afraid
that
some
will
come
upon
this
land
and
the
of
god
will
arise
and
there
will
be
no
i
can
not
but
pity
poor
who
though
but
a
young
man
it
may
be
he
must
appear
before
the
judgment
seat
of
god
and
what
answer
will
he
give
for
printing
things
so
vile
and
abominable
it
is
quite
evident
that
neither
james
nor
benjamin
had
that
respect
for
the
judgment
seat
which
became
christians
but
james
replied
in
the
to
this
onslaught
maintaining
that
mather
had
garbled
his
quotations
from
the
paper
or
based
his
opinion
on
parts
of
paragraphs
which
did
not
convey
the
full
and
correct
meaning
he
turned
the
tables
upon
him
also
by
declaring
that
while
mather
ceased
to
be
a
subscriber
to
his
paper
he
sent
his
grandson
every
week
to
buy
it
and
paying
in
this
way
a
higher
price
he
was
more
of
a
supporter
of
the
paper
than
ever
in
the
same
issue
too
james
said
i
would
likewise
advise
the
enemies
of
the
not
to
publish
any
thing
more
against
me
unless
they
are
willing
to
have
the
paper
continued
what
they
have
already
done
has
been
resented
by
the
town
so
much
to
my
advantage
that
above
forty
persons
have
subscribed
for
the
since
the
first
of
january
many
of
whom
were
before
subscribers
to
the
other
papers
and
by
one
advertisement
more
the
will
be
in
great
danger
of
adding
forty
more
to
my
list
before
the
first
of
march
james
showed
that
he
did
not
say
if
the
ministers
of
god
approve
of
a
thing
it
is
a
sign
it
is
of
the
devil
but
that
he
did
say
most
of
the
ministers
are
for
it
and
that
induces
me
to
think
it
is
from
the
devil
for
he
often
makes
use
of
good
men
as
instruments
to
obtrude
his
delusions
on
the
world
there
would
be
decided
objection
to
the
first
utterance
at
that
time
or
since
but
the
second
one
what
the
did
say
was
as
near
the
truth
as
either
side
was
found
in
most
matters
to
return
to
james
in
prison
he
was
confined
in
a
cell
and
was
very
uncomfortable
it
was
a
dirty
dismal
place
meant
to
be
a
place
of
punishment
indeed
james
found
it
so
and
he
soon
was
ready
to
do
almost
any
thing
for
freedom
of
the
yard
he
sat
down
and
addressed
a
very
humble
petition
to
the
council
confessing
his
wrong
and
imploring
forgiveness
and
release
from
his
cell
i
am
truly
sensible
of
and
heartily
sorry
for
the
offense
i
have
given
to
the
court
in
the
late
relating
to
the
fitting
out
of
a
ship
by
the
government
and
i
truly
acknowledge
my
inadvertency
and
folly
therein
in
affronting
the
government
as
also
my
indiscretion
and
indecency
when
before
the
court
for
all
of
which
i
intreat
the
court
forgiveness
and
pray
for
a
discharge
from
the
stone
prison
where
i
am
confined
by
order
of
the
court
and
that
i
may
have
the
liberty
of
the
yard
being
much
indisposed
and
suffering
in
my
health
by
the
said
confinement
while
the
council
are
considering
this
petition
we
will
see
what
has
become
of
the
the
whole
charge
of
it
devolved
on
benjamin
from
the
time
his
brother
was
imprisoned
and
he
fearlessly
and
ably
met
the
emergency
it
was
truly
wonderful
that
a
boy
of
sixteen
should
shoulder
the
responsibility
of
such
an
enterprise
in
such
circumstances
and
carry
it
with
so
much
courage
and
ease
i
can
look
after
it
there
no
trouble
in
that
said
benjamin
to
the
liberal
club
who
assembled
as
soon
as
possible
after
james
was
incarcerated
the
action
of
the
court
will
increase
our
subscribers
and
i
propose
to
make
the
paper
more
spicy
than
ever
glad
to
hear
that
responded
one
of
the
club
let
us
defy
such
intolerance
though
all
the
magistrates
and
ministers
in
boston
support
it
the
mass
of
the
people
are
with
us
that
is
so
remarked
another
and
more
are
coming
over
to
our
side
every
day
intimidation
does
not
become
us
now
we
must
continue
to
be
outspoken
and
if
benjamin
can
look
after
the
paper
we
are
all
right
that
i
can
do
and
i
want
no
better
sport
replied
the
plucky
you
may
be
sure
that
such
persecution
will
not
be
sustained
by
a
great
majority
of
new
england
people
we
are
living
in
england
and
not
in
england
and
the
people
know
it
i
think
benjamin
understands
it
added
a
third
member
of
the
club
and
his
courage
and
ability
will
meet
the
occasion
for
one
i
want
the
to
continue
to
be
what
it
has
been
the
general
court
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
benjamin
did
understand
it
and
edited
the
paper
on
the
same
line
he
forgot
all
his
disagreements
with
his
brother
in
his
sympathy
with
him
under
persecution
and
in
his
utter
contempt
for
the
action
of
the
court
in
these
circumstances
his
attacks
upon
the
administration
were
rather
more
severe
than
ever
the
proceedings
of
the
council
were
assailed
by
argument
eloquence
and
satire
in
prose
and
verse
in
squib
and
essay
one
number
issued
just
after
james
release
was
nearly
filled
with
passages
from
charta
and
comments
upon
the
same
showing
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
treatment
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
it
is
evident
that
a
considerable
number
of
the
people
of
boston
most
heartily
sympathized
with
the
in
its
gallant
contest
for
the
liberty
of
the
press
and
that
the
issue
of
the
number
was
to
these
and
to
others
the
most
interesting
event
of
the
week
the
authorities
considered
james
petition
and
granted
it
but
they
kept
him
four
weeks
in
prison
before
they
let
him
out
he
returned
to
his
printing
office
resolved
to
make
the
more
outspoken
still
for
the
freedom
of
the
press
the
club
met
him
with
warm
congratulations
a
great
many
printers
have
suffered
more
than
you
have
said
one
of
the
number
for
you
have
not
lost
your
head
not
even
an
ear
in
old
england
persecution
of
printers
has
been
in
order
for
a
long
time
less
than
two
years
ago
one
john
matthews
a
youth
nineteen
years
of
age
was
executed
at
tyburn
for
writing
and
publishing
a
tract
in
favor
of
the
expelled
stuarts
but
such
things
do
not
fit
our
country
answered
james
my
father
came
here
to
escape
that
spirit
of
caste
and
intolerance
that
abounds
in
england
and
so
did
those
who
came
long
before
he
did
to
repeat
them
here
is
a
greater
abomination
than
to
act
them
there
let
me
read
to
you
interrupted
benjamin
an
account
of
a
execution
in
england
about
twenty
years
before
my
father
emigrated
to
this
country
i
came
across
it
in
this
book
a
few
days
ago
it
is
horrible
benjamin
read
as
follows
the
scene
is
in
a
in
the
old
bailey
chief
justice
hyde
presiding
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
was
a
printer
named
john
gwyn
a
poor
man
with
a
wife
and
three
children
gwyn
was
accused
of
printing
a
piece
which
criticised
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
which
contained
these
words
and
others
similar
the
magistrates
pervert
judgment
the
people
are
bound
by
the
law
of
god
to
execute
judgment
without
them
upon
this
was
all
his
offense
but
it
was
construed
as
a
justification
of
the
execution
of
charles
i
as
well
as
a
threat
against
charles
ii
then
king
of
england
the
poor
man
protested
he
had
never
read
the
offensive
matter
it
was
brought
to
him
by
a
he
had
earned
forty
shillings
by
printing
it
when
he
was
pronounced
guilty
he
humbly
begged
for
mercy
pleading
poverty
his
young
children
and
his
ignorance
of
the
contents
of
the
paper
tell
you
what
you
shall
do
roared
the
brutal
wretch
who
sat
on
the
bench
mercy
of
them
that
can
give
it
that
is
of
god
and
the
king
the
prisoner
said
humbly
beseech
you
to
intercede
with
his
majesty
for
mercy
him
up
executioner
cried
the
judge
speak
it
from
my
soul
i
think
we
have
the
greatest
happiness
in
the
world
in
enjoying
what
we
do
under
so
good
and
gracious
a
king
yet
you
gwyn
in
the
rancor
of
your
heart
thus
to
abuse
him
deserve
no
mercy
in
a
similar
strain
he
continued
for
several
minutes
and
then
passed
upon
the
prisoner
the
following
sentence
he
was
to
be
drawn
to
the
place
of
execution
upon
a
hurdle
and
there
hanged
by
the
neck
while
still
alive
he
was
to
be
cut
down
castrated
and
disemboweled
you
still
living
added
the
judge
entrails
are
to
be
burnt
before
your
eyes
your
head
to
be
cut
off
and
your
head
and
quarters
to
be
disposed
of
at
the
pleasure
of
the
king
majesty
the
printer
was
overwhelmed
with
terror
and
in
his
great
agony
he
cried
to
the
judge
again
to
intercede
for
him
the
heartless
magistrate
replied
would
not
intercede
for
my
own
father
in
this
case
the
prisoner
was
removed
and
executed
his
head
and
limbs
were
set
up
over
the
gates
of
the
city
that
was
in
said
benjamin
as
he
closed
the
account
and
though
we
have
no
record
of
another
so
fiendish
affair
it
is
a
fact
that
within
a
few
years
some
printers
and
editors
in
england
have
had
their
ears
cropped
others
have
been
flogged
publicly
and
others
still
put
into
the
stocks
and
pillory
we
have
not
come
to
that
yet
not
quite
answered
one
of
the
club
but
the
authorities
who
would
please
the
king
and
suppress
liberty
of
the
press
will
go
as
far
as
they
dare
to
go
in
that
direction
depend
on
that
it
becomes
us
to
vindicate
our
rights
fearlessly
or
we
shall
yet
share
the
fate
of
gwyn
i
do
not
propose
to
spike
one
of
my
guns
said
james
who
listened
to
the
last
remarks
with
profound
emotion
we
are
right
and
americans
will
support
us
the
was
started
for
a
purpose
and
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
it
benjamin
has
run
the
paper
to
suit
while
you
were
in
jail
so
that
i
think
both
of
you
together
will
satisfy
us
perfectly
in
the
future
added
another
of
the
club
i
fully
believe
with
the
rest
of
you
that
it
is
no
time
now
to
cringe
before
the
authorities
a
stand
for
the
right
is
more
necessary
now
than
ever
before
we
should
have
stated
before
that
in
the
infancy
of
the
lady
mary
wortley
montagu
returned
from
turkey
with
the
remedy
for
the
inoculation
this
disease
had
prevailed
fearfully
in
boston
when
the
town
had
but
five
or
six
thousand
inhabitants
seven
hundred
of
them
died
of
in
six
months
in
when
benjamin
was
in
the
printing
office
and
the
population
of
the
town
was
twelve
thousand
the
number
of
deaths
by
was
eight
hundred
and
fifty
many
persons
attacked
with
it
died
within
two
or
three
days
so
that
it
was
a
terror
to
the
people
of
course
inoculation
was
received
with
delight
by
many
cotton
mather
examined
its
claims
and
so
did
his
father
increase
mather
and
both
endorsed
it
but
the
for
some
reason
opposed
it
and
brought
all
its
resources
of
ridicule
and
sarcasm
to
make
it
appear
ridiculous
a
writer
in
its
columns
called
it
the
minister
remedy
because
the
clergy
favored
it
week
after
week
it
denounced
the
method
and
warned
the
people
finally
increase
mather
publicly
called
attention
to
the
scandalous
sheet
and
besought
the
people
to
crush
it
lest
the
judgments
of
god
be
brought
down
upon
the
land
for
its
highhanded
wickedness
that
the
treatment
of
james
franklin
by
the
authorities
was
not
justified
by
thoughtful
citizens
in
other
parts
of
the
country
is
evident
from
the
following
extract
from
the
the
injustice
of
imprisoning
a
man
without
a
hearing
must
be
apparent
to
all
an
indifferent
person
would
judge
from
this
conduct
that
the
assembly
of
massachusetts
are
oppressors
and
bigots
who
make
religion
only
an
engine
of
destruction
to
the
people
we
pity
the
people
who
are
compelled
to
submit
to
the
tyranny
of
priestcraft
and
hypocrisy
then
followed
a
sarcastic
postscript
over
which
the
reader
may
smile
by
private
letter
from
boston
we
are
informed
that
the
bakers
are
under
great
apprehensions
of
being
forbid
baking
any
more
bread
unless
they
will
submit
to
the
secretary
as
supervisor
general
and
weigher
of
the
dough
before
it
is
baked
into
bread
and
offered
to
sale
the
closing
sentence
referred
to
the
action
of
the
legislature
in
enacting
that
franklin
should
publish
nothing
more
without
first
submitting
it
to
the
secretary
of
the
province
and
receiving
his
endorsement
legislation
that
will
be
quoted
in
the
next
chapter
franklin
continued
to
issue
the
after
his
imprisonment
with
more
plainness
and
exposure
of
public
wrongs
than
he
did
before
for
several
months
he
handled
the
governor
and
public
officers
severely
never
forgetting
those
ministers
who
supported
the
cause
of
the
king
instead
of
the
cause
of
new
england
he
little
thought
that
he
was
fighting
a
battle
for
the
ages
to
come
from
his
day
the
press
in
our
country
began
to
enjoy
liberty
he
began
a
conflict
which
did
not
end
until
liberty
of
speech
and
press
was
proclaimed
throughout
the
land
men
have
often
contended
for
right
and
started
enterprises
the
results
of
which
the
divinest
prophet
could
never
have
foretold
when
john
pounds
the
poor
portsmouth
shoemaker
with
a
passion
for
doing
good
to
those
who
needed
it
most
gathered
a
few
into
his
shanty
to
teach
them
something
good
while
he
hammered
his
leather
and
mended
shoes
he
did
not
dream
that
he
was
inaugurating
a
benevolent
enterprise
that
would
spread
throughout
the
christian
world
but
he
did
and
the
fifteen
millions
of
old
and
young
in
the
sabbath
schools
of
our
republic
are
but
the
growth
and
development
he
began
in
his
shop
in
like
manner
the
franklin
brothers
inaugurated
a
measure
that
culminated
in
the
complete
freedom
of
the
press
parton
life
of
franklin
vol
i
xvi
the
boy
editor
for
six
months
the
continued
its
attacks
upon
the
government
after
the
editor
came
out
of
prison
it
took
up
also
the
inconsistencies
of
church
members
and
discussed
them
with
great
plainness
but
the
number
of
the
paper
for
was
too
much
for
aristocratic
flesh
and
blood
and
almost
too
much
for
blood
that
was
not
aristocratic
the
council
was
incensed
and
adopted
the
following
order
in
council
whereas
the
paper
called
new
england
of
this
date
contains
many
passages
in
which
the
holy
scriptures
are
perverted
and
the
civil
government
ministers
and
people
of
the
province
highly
reflected
on
that
william
tailer
samuel
sewell
and
penn
townsend
with
such
as
the
honorable
house
of
representatives
shall
join
be
a
committee
to
consider
and
report
what
is
proper
for
the
court
to
do
thereon
the
house
of
representatives
concurred
in
the
measure
and
it
was
rushed
through
as
measures
are
likely
to
be
when
the
dander
of
legislators
is
up
and
the
committee
reported
as
follows
that
james
franklin
the
printer
and
publisher
thereof
be
strictly
forbidden
by
the
court
to
print
or
publish
new
england
or
any
other
pamphlet
or
paper
of
the
like
nature
except
that
it
is
first
supervised
by
the
secretary
of
the
province
and
the
justices
of
his
majesty
sessions
of
the
peace
for
the
county
of
suffolk
at
their
next
adjournment
be
directed
to
take
sufficient
bonds
of
the
said
franklin
for
twelve
months
time
as
soon
as
the
council
took
this
action
the
club
was
called
together
and
the
whole
matter
canvassed
the
next
thing
will
be
an
order
that
no
one
of
us
shall
have
a
pair
of
breeches
without
permission
from
the
secretary
of
the
province
remarked
one
sarcastically
the
secretary
has
not
brains
enough
to
pass
judgment
upon
some
of
our
articles
and
he
is
too
english
to
judge
rightly
of
new
england
necessities
we
should
appear
smart
tugging
our
articles
over
to
the
secretary
each
week
for
his
permission
to
print
them
suggested
james
i
shall
never
do
it
as
long
as
my
name
is
james
franklin
nor
i
added
one
of
the
club
nor
i
another
nor
i
another
still
there
was
but
one
mind
in
the
company
and
all
were
disposed
to
fight
it
out
on
the
line
of
freedom
of
the
press
but
do
you
notice
added
one
of
the
club
that
no
one
but
james
franklin
is
forbidden
to
publish
the
some
other
person
can
publish
it
sure
enough
that
is
so
responded
james
and
here
is
our
way
out
of
the
difficulty
of
course
you
can
not
publish
it
yourself
addressing
james
in
defiance
of
this
order
of
the
council
of
course
not
but
benjamin
franklin
can
do
it
as
he
is
not
forbidden
how
would
that
do
that
can
not
be
done
because
he
is
only
an
apprentice
suggested
a
former
speaker
they
can
prove
that
he
is
your
apprentice
readily
well
i
can
meet
that
difficulty
without
any
trouble
said
james
who
was
intent
upon
evading
the
order
of
the
court
pray
tell
us
how
by
changing
the
name
of
the
paper
not
by
any
means
now
is
not
the
time
to
part
with
a
name
that
the
magistrates
and
ministers
are
so
much
in
love
with
how
then
can
you
meet
the
difficulty
well
i
can
return
his
indenture
with
his
discharge
upon
the
back
of
it
and
he
can
show
it
in
case
of
necessity
at
the
same
time
he
can
sign
a
new
indenture
that
will
be
kept
a
secret
capital
exclaimed
one
i
never
thought
of
that
the
measure
is
a
practical
one
and
i
move
that
we
reduce
it
to
practice
at
once
i
support
it
with
all
my
heart
not
only
as
practical
but
ingenious
added
another
it
is
honorable
to
meet
the
tyranny
of
the
council
with
an
innocent
subterfuge
like
that
all
agreed
to
the
plan
and
adopted
it
enthusiastically
benjamin
franklin
editor
of
the
exclaimed
a
member
of
the
club
rising
from
his
seat
and
patting
benjamin
on
the
shoulder
do
that
sound
well
my
boy
rather
a
young
fellow
to
have
in
charge
such
an
enterprise
but
a
match
i
guess
for
the
general
court
of
the
province
the
youngest
editor
proprietor
and
publisher
of
a
paper
in
the
whole
land
no
doubt
suggested
another
but
it
is
as
true
here
as
it
is
in
other
things
men
for
counsel
young
men
for
war
we
are
at
war
now
and
we
do
not
want
an
editor
who
will
cry
peace
when
there
is
no
peace
a
free
man
too
suggested
another
facetiously
an
apprentice
no
longer
to
be
knocked
about
and
treated
as
an
underling
at
the
top
with
the
laurels
of
manhood
on
the
brow
of
sixteen
benjamin
had
not
spoken
but
he
had
listened
affairs
had
taken
an
unexpected
turn
in
the
morning
he
had
no
idea
of
becoming
of
the
paper
that
made
more
stir
in
boston
than
the
other
two
combined
the
promotion
rather
startled
him
not
that
he
shrank
from
the
responsibility
for
he
had
no
hesitation
in
assuming
that
but
the
promotion
was
wholly
unexpected
the
honors
came
upon
him
suddenly
in
a
way
he
never
dreamed
of
it
is
not
strange
that
he
was
somewhat
dumbfounded
though
not
confounded
he
maintained
silence
because
in
the
circumstances
he
could
say
nothing
better
than
silence
the
plan
of
james
having
been
adopted
all
hastened
to
carry
out
the
details
benjamin
received
his
indenture
with
the
endorsement
that
constituted
him
a
free
man
and
he
was
announced
as
the
publisher
of
the
and
as
such
his
name
appeared
upon
the
paper
also
as
editor
in
the
next
issue
james
inserted
the
following
in
the
the
late
publisher
of
this
paper
finding
so
many
inconveniences
would
arise
by
his
carrying
the
manuscripts
and
the
public
news
to
be
supervised
by
the
secretary
as
to
render
his
carrying
it
on
unprofitable
has
entirely
dropped
the
undertaking
benjamin
inserted
an
amusing
salutatory
as
if
the
was
appearing
before
the
public
for
the
first
time
it
was
as
follows
long
has
the
press
groaned
in
bringing
forth
a
hateful
brood
of
pamphlets
malicious
scribbles
and
billingsgate
ribaldry
no
generous
and
impartial
person
then
can
blame
the
present
undertaking
which
is
designed
purely
for
the
diversion
and
merriment
of
the
reader
pieces
of
pleasantry
and
mirth
have
a
secret
charm
in
them
to
allay
the
heats
and
tumults
of
our
spirits
and
to
make
a
man
forget
his
restless
resentment
the
main
design
of
this
weekly
paper
will
be
to
entertain
the
town
with
the
most
comical
and
diverting
incidents
of
human
life
which
in
so
large
a
place
as
boston
will
not
fail
of
a
universal
exemplification
nor
shall
we
be
wanting
to
fill
up
these
papers
with
a
grateful
interspersion
of
more
serious
words
which
may
be
drawn
from
the
most
ludicrous
and
odd
parts
of
life
pretty
good
for
a
boy
of
sixteen
good
sense
tact
humor
and
rhetoric
combined
in
one
brief
paragraph
not
only
the
youngest
editor
in
but
the
youngest
editor
of
a
city
paper
from
that
day
to
this
so
far
as
we
know
on
the
fact
hangs
a
tale
of
the
wonderful
powers
of
a
boy
who
can
occupy
such
a
place
and
fill
it
we
have
said
that
the
of
was
filled
with
matter
that
exasperated
officials
of
the
province
the
reader
will
want
to
know
what
some
of
those
utterances
were
we
will
copy
a
few
religion
is
indeed
the
principal
thing
but
too
much
of
it
is
worse
than
none
at
all
the
world
abounds
with
knaves
and
villains
but
of
all
knaves
the
religious
knave
is
the
worst
and
villainies
acted
under
the
cloak
of
religion
the
most
execrable
moral
honesty
though
it
will
not
itself
carry
a
man
to
heaven
yet
i
am
sure
there
is
no
going
thither
without
it
but
are
there
such
men
as
these
in
thee
o
new
england
heaven
forbid
there
should
be
any
but
alas
it
is
to
be
feared
the
number
is
not
small
me
an
honest
say
some
all
a
religious
a
distinction
which
i
confess
i
never
heard
of
before
the
whole
country
suffers
for
the
villainies
of
a
few
such
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
and
we
are
all
represented
as
a
pack
of
knaves
and
hypocrites
for
their
sakes
in
old
time
it
was
no
disrespect
for
men
and
women
to
be
called
by
their
own
names
was
never
called
adam
we
never
heard
of
noah
lot
and
nor
the
abraham
mesopotamia
of
canaan
no
no
they
were
plain
men
honest
country
graziers
that
took
care
of
their
families
and
their
flocks
was
a
great
prophet
and
a
priest
of
the
lord
but
we
never
read
of
the
moses
nor
the
reverend
father
in
aaron
by
divine
providence
of
israel
thou
never
sawest
rebecca
in
the
bible
rachel
nor
tho
a
princess
of
the
blood
after
the
death
of
called
the
of
nazareth
no
plain
rachel
or
the
mary
or
the
like
it
was
no
incivility
then
to
mention
their
naked
names
as
they
were
expressed
yet
one
of
our
club
will
undertake
to
prove
that
tho
was
not
styled
yet
he
had
the
title
of
given
him
by
his
wife
which
he
thinks
entitles
her
to
the
honour
of
sarah
and
being
married
into
the
same
family
he
concludes
that
she
may
deserve
the
title
of
rachel
but
this
is
but
the
opinion
of
one
man
it
was
never
put
to
vote
in
the
society
on
the
whole
friend
james
we
may
conclude
that
the
opponents
of
the
are
a
sort
of
who
mistaking
religion
for
the
peculiar
whims
of
their
own
brain
are
for
cutting
or
stretching
all
men
to
their
own
standard
of
thinking
i
wish
symmes
character
may
secure
him
from
the
woes
and
curses
they
are
so
free
of
dispensing
among
their
dissenting
neighbours
who
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
discover
a
cheerfulness
becoming
christianity
it
is
not
questioned
that
benjamin
wrote
these
paragraphs
among
others
and
for
keen
satire
they
are
very
remarkable
as
the
composition
of
a
boy
of
sixteen
at
the
present
day
they
would
be
regarded
as
quaint
able
and
truthful
without
awakening
opposition
but
in
no
doubt
there
were
tender
consciences
among
the
official
sycophants
of
the
english
government
that
made
a
just
application
of
these
cutting
words
so
as
to
become
exasperated
and
bitter
hence
their
tyrannical
and
unjustifiable
legislation
parton
mentions
a
fact
that
should
be
noted
here
until
the
revolution
the
business
of
publishing
newspapers
in
america
was
carried
on
almost
exclusively
by
postmasters
newspapers
went
free
of
postage
in
the
colonies
as
late
as
until
that
time
the
postmasters
had
not
only
the
privilege
of
sending
papers
through
the
mail
free
but
the
still
more
valuable
right
of
excluding
from
the
mail
papers
published
by
others
accordingly
we
find
that
nearly
all
the
pioneers
of
the
press
in
boston
new
york
and
philadelphia
were
postmasters
when
a
postmaster
lost
his
office
he
generally
sold
out
his
newspaper
and
a
new
postmaster
soon
bought
or
established
one
john
campbell
however
feeling
himself
aggrieved
by
his
removal
did
not
dispose
of
the
first
paper
in
this
country
which
induced
his
successor
william
brocker
to
set
up
a
paper
of
his
own
the
which
appeared
in
december
brocker
expressly
says
in
his
prospectus
that
he
started
the
new
paper
at
the
request
of
several
merchants
and
others
who
been
from
having
their
newspaper
sent
them
by
the
post
ever
since
campbell
was
removed
from
being
postmaster
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
in
newspapers
ceased
to
be
carried
free
in
the
mails
and
a
charge
of
ninepence
a
year
for
each
fifty
miles
of
carriage
was
assessed
and
our
benjamin
brought
about
the
change
he
was
then
known
as
deputy
postmaster
general
and
made
the
change
in
the
interest
of
the
public
welfare
we
think
that
at
the
time
he
must
have
recalled
his
tussle
with
the
general
court
when
at
sixteen
he
edited
the
benjamin
continued
in
his
brother
printing
office
eight
months
after
the
occurrence
just
narrated
editor
and
publisher
of
the
his
brother
never
run
the
paper
again
in
his
own
name
and
subsequently
he
removed
to
newport
where
he
established
the
island
in
benjamin
kept
up
his
running
fire
against
the
truckling
representatives
of
the
british
government
including
ministers
who
were
not
outspoken
against
oppression
and
the
censorship
of
the
press
the
blade
of
his
satire
became
brighter
and
keener
and
the
circulation
of
the
paper
increased
largely
showing
that
the
portion
of
the
population
having
the
true
american
spirit
were
in
sympathy
with
the
purpose
of
the
paper
sparks
says
of
it
it
touched
with
great
freedom
the
vices
and
follies
of
the
time
the
weapon
of
satire
was
used
with
an
unsparing
hand
neither
the
government
nor
the
clergy
escaped
much
caution
was
practised
however
in
regard
to
individuals
and
names
were
seldom
introduced
there
are
some
severe
and
humorous
criticisms
on
the
poets
of
the
day
which
may
be
classed
with
the
best
specimens
of
this
kind
of
composition
in
the
modern
reviews
the
humor
sometimes
degenerates
into
coarseness
and
the
phraseology
is
often
harsh
but
bating
these
faults
the
paper
contains
nothing
which
in
later
times
would
have
been
deemed
reprehensible
of
the
action
of
the
general
court
imprisoning
james
franklin
sparks
says
he
was
sentenced
by
a
vote
of
the
assembly
without
any
specification
of
offensive
passages
or
any
trial
before
a
court
of
justice
this
was
probably
the
first
transaction
in
the
american
colonies
relating
to
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
it
is
not
less
remarkable
for
the
assumption
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
than
for
their
disregard
of
the
first
principles
and
established
forms
of
law
this
is
a
fair
and
just
estimate
of
the
affair
probably
officials
saw
their
mistake
and
concluded
not
to
repeat
it
for
benjamin
was
not
molested
in
his
business
though
he
continued
to
be
as
saucy
and
sarcastic
as
ever
from
that
day
freedom
of
the
press
was
assured
in
this
country
this
narrative
of
benjamin
connection
with
the
printing
office
at
the
time
a
new
paper
was
to
be
established
shows
that
the
circumstances
called
out
a
certain
kind
of
talent
he
possessed
and
thus
helped
to
make
him
what
he
became
success
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
early
directing
the
young
in
the
path
to
which
their
natural
endowments
point
square
men
should
be
put
into
square
holes
and
round
men
into
round
holes
many
careers
are
spoiled
by
reversing
this
law
of
nature
getting
square
men
into
round
holes
and
round
men
into
square
holes
a
good
mechanic
has
often
been
spoiled
to
make
an
indifferent
clergyman
or
merchant
and
a
good
minister
has
been
spoiled
to
make
a
commonplace
artisan
overlooking
the
natural
bent
the
youth
has
selected
an
occupation
or
his
father
for
him
for
which
he
has
no
special
aptitude
and
he
brings
little
to
pass
benjamin
was
a
square
youth
and
he
got
into
a
square
hole
which
he
just
fitted
he
was
not
there
by
his
own
election
he
was
there
by
the
lead
of
providence
and
he
cheerfully
acquiesced
becoming
the
right
boy
in
the
right
place
he
grew
into
stalwart
manhood
and
a
useful
life
as
naturally
as
the
sapling
on
congenial
soil
grows
into
the
thrifty
tree
in
the
second
chapter
we
spoke
of
boston
in
the
infancy
of
benjamin
as
a
place
where
bears
were
plenty
and
other
wild
animals
roamed
the
contained
the
following
paragraph
about
the
time
of
its
contest
with
the
court
and
we
copy
it
as
a
fitting
close
to
this
chapter
it
is
thought
that
not
less
than
twenty
bears
have
been
killed
in
about
a
week
time
within
two
miles
of
boston
two
have
been
killed
below
the
castle
as
they
were
swimming
from
one
island
to
another
and
one
attempted
to
board
a
boat
out
in
the
bay
but
the
men
defended
themselves
so
well
with
the
and
oars
that
they
put
out
her
eyes
and
then
killed
her
on
tuesday
last
two
were
killed
at
dorchester
one
of
which
weighed
sixty
pounds
a
quarter
we
hear
from
providence
that
the
bears
appear
to
be
very
thick
in
those
parts
vol
i
xvii
the
young
skeptic
what
book
have
you
there
ben
inquired
john
collins
some
time
before
the
newspaper
enterprise
was
started
lord
shaftesbury
work
i
have
been
looking
into
it
for
some
time
and
anthony
collins
work
too
answered
benjamin
i
suppose
that
my
father
would
say
they
are
not
quite
orthodox
but
they
are
very
interesting
and
i
think
their
views
are
reasonable
i
have
been
questioning
your
orthodoxy
for
some
time
ben
but
i
thought
you
would
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
and
so
i
have
said
nothing
i
do
not
know
about
your
coming
out
right
if
you
become
a
disciple
of
shaftesbury
john
made
this
reply
more
in
jest
than
in
earnest
for
he
cared
little
whether
benjamin
was
a
skeptic
or
not
perhaps
he
was
skeptical
himself
at
that
time
some
things
indicate
as
much
i
think
it
is
rather
difficult
to
tell
how
i
shall
come
out
john
but
i
do
not
propose
to
believe
any
thing
in
religion
science
or
any
thing
else
just
because
my
father
does
responded
benjamin
i
know
that
i
have
accepted
some
religious
dogmas
because
i
was
taught
them
and
for
no
other
reason
then
you
do
not
now
believe
all
that
you
have
been
taught
about
religion
if
i
understand
you
no
i
am
free
to
say
that
i
do
not
there
is
neither
reason
nor
wisdom
in
portions
of
the
creed
of
the
church
why
ben
you
surprise
me
you
are
getting
to
be
quite
an
infidel
for
a
boy
it
wo
do
for
you
to
read
shaftesbury
and
collins
any
more
if
you
are
so
easily
upset
by
them
i
do
not
know
any
thing
about
them
only
from
what
i
hear
i
never
read
a
paragraph
of
either
one
thing
is
sure
continued
benjamin
i
mean
to
be
classed
among
the
few
people
who
think
for
themselves
it
is
a
small
company
i
shall
be
found
in
but
it
is
an
independent
one
most
people
are
religious
because
they
are
so
instructed
they
embrace
the
religion
of
their
fathers
and
mothers
without
asking
what
is
true
or
false
i
will
not
be
of
that
class
i
will
not
be
orthodox
or
heterodox
because
my
ancestors
were
there
is
not
much
danger
that
you
will
do
that
ben
present
appearances
rather
indicate
that
the
religious
opinions
of
your
father
will
be
blown
john
did
not
mean
quite
as
much
as
his
language
in
this
reply
denoted
you
do
not
understand
me
i
respect
my
parents
and
their
religious
opinions
though
i
doubt
some
of
the
doctrines
they
have
taught
me
i
never
examined
them
until
i
began
to
read
shaftesbury
and
collins
but
accepted
them
as
correct
because
my
father
and
grandfather
believed
them
i
shall
do
that
no
more
that
is
all
i
meant
well
i
can
not
say
that
you
are
wrong
ben
if
you
make
half
as
good
a
man
as
your
father
is
by
believing
half
the
truths
he
believes
and
advocates
you
will
stand
pretty
well
in
the
world
i
expect
that
we
ought
to
avoid
religious
cant
bigotry
and
intolerance
i
expect
so
too
and
there
is
much
of
all
three
existing
benjamin
answered
a
bigot
may
be
a
man
but
so
much
the
worse
for
him
there
is
so
much
bigotry
in
boston
that
the
minister
of
each
denomination
thinks
his
denomination
has
all
the
truth
and
all
the
religion
there
is
i
think
that
idea
is
a
falsehood
to
begin
with
i
shall
agree
with
you
there
ben
i
have
no
question
that
a
man
may
be
a
christian
without
believing
half
that
most
denominations
profess
to
believe
and
i
suppose
that
the
main
thing
is
to
be
christians
and
not
theologians
you
are
drifting
to
my
side
as
fast
as
is
necessary
remarked
benjamin
laughing
you
will
come
clear
over
in
due
time
i
am
sure
you
will
if
you
read
shaftesbury
well
i
must
drift
home
in
a
hurry
responded
john
whether
i
shall
drift
to
you
the
future
will
reveal
you
are
now
in
too
deep
water
for
me
i
should
drown
if
i
got
in
where
you
are
john
left
and
benjamin
went
on
thinking
as
he
was
wont
he
put
more
thinking
into
every
hours
than
any
three
boys
together
in
boston
at
this
time
he
was
quite
a
doubter
really
a
young
skeptic
in
the
printing
office
he
drifted
in
that
direction
faster
and
faster
he
was
a
kind
of
speculator
from
childhood
he
loved
to
argue
he
enjoyed
being
on
the
opposite
side
to
indulge
his
propensity
to
argue
after
he
learned
the
socratic
method
of
reasoning
he
was
more
inclined
to
discuss
religion
with
different
parties
perhaps
he
did
it
to
practise
the
method
rather
than
to
show
his
aversion
to
religion
but
judging
from
what
followed
in
the
next
three
or
four
years
he
grew
decidedly
unbelieving
we
can
discover
his
lack
of
reverence
for
the
christian
religion
and
want
of
confidence
in
it
in
articles
he
wrote
for
the
nothing
very
marked
it
is
true
but
some
of
his
articles
lean
in
that
direction
besides
benjamin
was
one
of
those
talented
independent
boys
who
think
it
is
manly
to
break
away
from
ancestral
creeds
when
he
was
eleven
years
old
he
was
assisting
his
father
to
pack
a
barrel
of
pork
for
winter
use
when
the
work
was
done
he
said
to
his
father
father
it
would
save
time
if
you
would
say
grace
over
the
whole
barrel
now
instead
of
saying
it
over
a
piece
at
a
time
whether
his
father
flogged
him
for
such
irreverence
we
are
not
told
nevertheless
the
fact
is
suggestive
of
an
element
in
the
to
which
the
ingenious
skeptic
may
appeal
with
success
possibly
it
was
only
the
native
humor
of
the
boy
which
with
his
love
of
fun
cropped
out
on
that
occasion
it
was
irreverence
however
whatever
may
have
been
his
motive
many
were
the
conversations
that
benjamin
had
with
his
friend
john
collins
upon
religion
after
becoming
thoroughly
poisoned
by
reading
shaftesbury
and
collins
by
the
way
john
i
should
like
to
read
to
you
what
your
namesake
says
on
the
subject
perhaps
you
descended
straight
from
this
illustrious
infidel
perhaps
so
but
i
shall
not
spend
time
in
tracing
my
pedigree
john
replied
i
never
dared
to
trace
my
ancestors
far
back
for
fear
i
should
run
into
some
disreputable
family
it
is
probably
an
accident
that
you
are
a
collins
so
that
we
lay
it
up
against
you
john
but
i
should
really
like
to
read
two
or
three
paragraphs
from
collins
work
that
you
may
judge
of
him
go
ahead
and
i
will
give
you
respectful
attention
if
it
is
above
my
capacity
to
understand
i
will
not
hold
you
responsible
benjamin
proceeded
to
read
from
collins
work
as
follows
opinions
how
erroneous
soever
when
the
effect
of
an
impartial
examination
will
never
hurt
men
in
the
sight
of
god
but
will
recommend
men
to
his
favour
for
impartial
examination
in
the
matter
of
opinion
is
the
best
that
a
man
can
do
towards
obtaining
truth
and
god
who
is
a
wise
good
and
just
being
can
require
no
more
of
men
than
to
do
their
best
and
will
reward
them
when
they
do
their
best
and
he
would
be
the
most
unjust
being
imaginable
if
he
punished
men
who
had
done
their
best
endeavor
to
please
him
besides
if
men
were
to
be
punished
by
god
for
mistaken
opinions
all
men
must
be
damned
for
all
men
abound
in
mistaken
opinions
while
rome
was
in
the
height
of
its
glory
for
arms
learning
and
politeness
there
were
hundred
different
professed
and
allowed
therein
and
this
groat
variety
does
not
appear
to
have
had
the
least
effect
on
the
peace
of
the
state
or
on
the
temper
of
men
but
on
the
contrary
a
very
good
effect
for
there
is
an
entire
silence
of
history
about
the
actions
of
those
ancient
professors
who
it
seems
lived
so
quietly
together
as
to
furnish
no
materials
for
an
such
as
christians
have
given
an
occasion
for
which
a
reverend
divine
thus
describes
says
he
chiefly
spent
in
reciting
the
wild
opinions
of
hereticks
that
is
in
belying
hereticks
the
contentions
between
emperors
and
popes
the
idle
and
superstitious
canons
and
ridiculous
decrees
and
constitutions
of
packed
councils
their
debates
about
frivolous
matters
and
playing
the
fool
with
religion
the
consultations
of
synods
about
augmenting
the
revenues
of
the
clergy
and
establishing
their
pride
and
grandure
the
impostures
of
monks
and
fryars
the
schisms
and
factions
of
the
church
the
tyranny
cruelty
and
impiety
of
the
clergy
insomuch
that
the
excellent
says
that
reads
ecclesiastical
reads
nothing
but
the
and
folly
of
bishops
and
matthew
says
jesus
and
dwelt
nazareth
it
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
saying
shall
be
called
a
nazarene
which
citation
does
not
expressly
occur
in
any
place
of
the
old
testament
and
therefore
can
not
be
literally
fulfilled
in
fine
the
prophecies
cited
from
the
old
testament
by
the
authors
of
the
new
do
plainly
relate
in
their
obvious
and
primary
sense
to
other
matters
than
those
which
they
are
produced
to
prove
well
said
john
interrupting
i
think
that
will
do
for
my
namesake
there
is
nothing
very
wonderful
to
me
about
that
true
enough
i
guess
but
nothing
remarkable
but
how
about
shaftesbury
what
has
he
written
he
disproves
the
miracles
of
the
new
testament
his
concerning
virtue
and
his
on
the
freedom
of
wit
and
are
interesting
as
novels
to
me
i
prefer
the
novels
interrupted
john
perhaps
you
do
but
shaftesbury
is
one
of
the
most
ingenious
and
pleasant
writers
known
he
does
not
discard
religion
he
assails
spurious
religion
only
and
spurious
religion
is
all
religion
that
he
do
not
believe
in
i
suppose
suggested
john
come
from
above
or
below
when
a
man
does
not
believe
the
bible
he
tries
to
show
it
up
and
so
when
a
man
do
not
believe
any
religion
but
his
own
he
tries
to
explode
all
others
read
shaftesbury
and
judge
for
yourself
added
benjamin
you
will
fall
in
love
with
him
as
i
have
he
is
one
of
the
most
graceful
and
fascinating
writers
i
know
of
perhaps
i
will
read
him
sometime
replied
john
i
must
go
now
and
when
i
am
ready
for
it
i
will
call
for
the
book
we
have
not
time
to
follow
the
companionship
of
these
two
youth
it
was
intimate
and
benjamin
succeeded
in
making
a
shaftesbury
disciple
of
john
so
that
one
was
about
as
much
of
an
unbeliever
as
the
other
in
his
autobiography
benjamin
confesses
that
he
made
a
doubter
by
reading
shaftesbury
and
although
he
began
to
dissent
from
his
father
as
we
have
already
seen
in
his
boyhood
when
he
read
the
religious
tracts
of
boyle
we
know
that
benjamin
was
charged
with
being
an
atheist
by
his
brother
true
it
was
when
his
brother
was
angry
because
he
left
him
still
he
would
not
have
been
likely
to
make
such
a
statement
to
others
without
some
foundation
for
it
franklin
himself
gives
one
reason
for
his
leaving
boston
in
his
autobiography
my
indiscreet
disputations
about
religion
began
to
make
me
pointed
at
with
horror
by
good
people
as
an
infidel
and
atheist
another
admission
in
his
autobiography
reflects
upon
this
subject
the
time
i
allotted
for
writing
exercises
and
for
reading
was
at
night
or
before
work
began
in
the
morning
on
when
i
contrived
to
be
in
the
printing
house
avoiding
as
much
as
i
could
the
constant
attendance
upon
public
worship
which
my
father
used
to
exact
of
me
when
i
was
under
his
care
and
which
i
still
continued
to
consider
a
duty
though
i
could
not
afford
time
to
practise
it
there
is
an
intimate
connection
between
loose
religious
views
and
the
of
the
sabbath
skeptics
are
not
friendly
to
the
sabbath
as
a
class
it
is
an
institution
they
inveigh
against
with
much
spirit
no
doubt
the
change
going
on
in
benjamin
opinions
had
much
to
do
with
his
ceasing
to
attend
public
worship
fifteen
years
afterwards
when
benjamin
was
fully
established
in
business
in
philadelphia
his
parents
became
very
anxious
about
his
skeptical
ideas
and
wrote
to
him
about
it
their
letter
is
not
preserved
but
we
have
his
in
reply
which
while
it
confirms
the
fact
shows
him
to
be
more
reverent
and
thoughtful
than
they
feared
it
is
also
evidence
of
a
filial
regard
for
his
father
and
mother
that
is
always
as
beautiful
as
it
is
honorable
we
furnish
the
letter
below
philadelphia
april
i
have
your
favors
of
the
of
march
in
which
you
both
seem
concerned
lest
i
have
imbibed
some
erroneous
opinions
doubtless
i
have
my
share
and
when
the
natural
weakness
and
imperfection
of
human
understanding
is
considered
the
unavoidable
influence
of
education
custom
books
and
company
upon
our
ways
of
thinking
i
imagine
a
man
must
have
a
good
deal
of
vanity
who
believes
and
a
good
deal
of
boldness
who
affirms
that
all
the
doctrines
he
holds
are
true
and
all
he
rejects
are
false
and
perhaps
the
same
may
be
justly
said
of
every
sect
church
and
society
of
men
when
they
assume
to
themselves
that
infallibility
which
they
deny
to
the
pope
and
councils
i
think
opinions
should
be
judged
of
by
their
influences
and
effects
and
if
man
holds
none
that
tend
to
make
him
less
virtuous
or
more
vicious
it
may
be
concluded
he
holds
none
that
are
dangerous
which
i
hope
is
the
case
with
me
i
am
sorry
you
should
have
any
uneasiness
on
my
account
and
if
it
were
a
thing
possible
for
one
to
alter
his
opinions
in
order
to
please
another
i
know
none
whom
i
ought
more
willingly
to
oblige
in
that
respect
than
yourselves
but
since
it
is
no
more
in
a
man
power
to
than
to
like
another
methinks
all
that
should
be
expected
from
me
is
to
keep
my
mind
open
to
conviction
to
hear
patiently
and
examine
attentively
whatever
is
offered
me
for
that
end
and
if
after
all
i
continue
in
the
same
errors
i
believe
your
usual
charity
will
induce
you
rather
to
pity
and
excuse
than
blame
me
in
the
mean
time
your
care
and
concern
for
me
is
what
i
am
very
thankful
for
my
mother
grieves
that
one
of
her
sons
is
an
arian
another
an
arminian
what
an
arminian
or
an
arian
is
i
can
not
say
that
i
very
well
know
the
truth
is
i
make
such
distinctions
very
little
my
study
i
think
vital
religion
has
always
suffered
when
orthodoxy
is
more
regarded
than
virtue
and
the
scriptures
assure
me
that
at
the
last
day
we
shall
not
be
examined
what
we
but
what
we
and
our
recommendation
will
not
be
that
we
said
but
that
we
did
good
to
our
see
matt
xx
as
to
the
free
masons
i
know
no
way
of
giving
my
mother
a
better
account
of
them
than
she
seems
to
have
at
present
since
it
is
not
allowed
that
women
should
be
admitted
into
that
secret
society
she
has
i
must
confess
on
that
account
some
reason
to
be
displeased
with
it
but
for
any
thing
else
i
must
entreat
her
to
suspend
her
judgment
till
she
is
better
informed
unless
she
will
believe
me
when
i
assure
her
that
they
are
in
general
a
very
harmless
sort
of
people
and
have
no
principles
or
practices
that
are
inconsistent
with
religion
and
good
manners
b
franklin
his
sister
also
later
on
in
her
great
anxiety
for
his
spiritual
welfare
wrote
to
him
and
he
replied
as
follows
philadelphia
july
sister
i
took
your
admonition
very
kindly
and
was
far
from
being
offended
at
you
for
it
if
i
say
any
thing
about
it
to
you
is
only
to
rectify
some
wrong
opinions
you
seem
to
have
entertained
of
me
and
this
i
do
only
because
they
give
you
some
uneasiness
which
i
am
unwilling
to
be
the
occasion
of
you
express
yourself
as
if
you
thought
i
was
against
worshipping
of
god
and
doubt
that
good
works
would
merit
heaven
which
are
both
fancies
of
your
own
i
think
without
foundation
i
am
so
far
from
thinking
that
god
is
not
to
be
worshipped
that
i
have
composed
and
wrote
a
whole
book
of
devotions
for
my
own
use
and
i
imagine
there
are
few
if
any
in
the
world
so
weak
as
to
imagine
that
the
little
good
we
can
do
here
can
merit
so
vast
a
reward
hereafter
there
are
some
things
in
your
new
england
doctrine
and
worship
which
i
do
not
agree
with
but
i
do
not
therefore
condemn
them
or
desire
to
shake
your
belief
or
practice
of
them
we
may
dislike
things
that
are
nevertheless
right
in
themselves
i
would
only
have
you
make
me
the
same
allowance
and
have
a
better
opinion
both
of
morality
and
your
brother
read
the
pages
of
edwards
late
book
entitled
thoughts
concerning
the
present
revival
of
religion
in
new
england
from
to
and
when
you
judge
of
others
if
you
can
perceive
the
fruit
to
be
good
do
not
terrify
yourself
that
the
tree
may
be
evil
be
assured
it
is
not
so
for
you
know
who
has
said
do
not
gather
grapes
off
thorns
and
figs
off
thistles
i
have
not
time
to
add
but
that
i
shall
always
be
your
affectionate
brother
franklin
it
was
not
kind
in
you
when
your
sister
commended
good
works
to
suppose
she
intended
it
a
reproach
to
you
was
very
far
from
her
thoughts
the
sequel
will
show
much
more
concerning
the
skepticism
of
franklin
and
that
the
time
came
when
he
saw
the
folly
of
such
unbelief
and
gave
his
adherence
to
the
christian
religion
at
the
same
time
he
learned
from
experience
the
danger
of
reading
infidel
publications
and
warned
the
young
against
following
his
example
indeed
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
as
early
as
when
he
was
but
years
of
age
he
was
not
so
much
of
an
infidel
as
some
of
his
friends
supposed
for
then
he
prepared
a
code
of
morals
and
belief
for
his
own
use
entitled
articles
of
belief
and
acts
of
religion
in
this
document
he
avows
his
belief
in
one
supreme
most
perfect
being
and
prays
to
be
preserved
from
atheism
impiety
and
profaneness
under
the
head
of
thanks
occur
the
following
for
peace
and
liberty
for
food
and
raiment
for
corn
and
wine
and
milk
and
every
kind
of
healthful
nourishment
good
god
i
thank
thee
for
the
common
benefits
of
air
and
light
for
useful
fire
and
delicious
water
good
god
i
thank
thee
for
knowledge
and
literature
and
every
useful
art
for
my
friends
and
their
prosperity
and
for
the
fewness
of
my
enemies
good
god
i
thank
thee
for
all
my
innumerable
benefits
for
life
and
reason
and
the
use
of
speech
for
health
and
joy
and
every
pleasant
hour
good
god
i
thank
thee
it
is
true
there
is
not
much
religion
in
these
things
and
though
they
may
have
been
adopted
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
conscience
only
they
prove
that
he
was
not
an
atheist
as
many
supposed
benjamin
experience
with
skeptical
and
infidel
books
recalls
the
experience
of
two
young
men
when
about
the
same
age
with
publications
of
kindred
character
which
came
very
near
depriving
the
united
states
of
two
good
presidents
before
abraham
lincoln
began
the
study
of
law
he
was
connected
with
a
clique
or
club
of
young
men
who
made
light
of
religion
and
read
books
that
treated
it
as
a
delusion
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
read
paine
age
of
reason
and
volney
ruins
through
which
he
was
influenced
to
array
himself
against
the
bible
for
a
time
as
much
of
a
skeptic
almost
as
any
one
of
his
boon
companions
but
his
early
religious
training
soon
asserted
itself
and
we
hear
no
more
of
hostility
to
religion
as
long
as
he
lived
on
the
other
hand
when
he
was
elected
president
he
spoke
as
follows
to
his
friends
and
neighbors
who
had
assembled
at
the
station
to
bid
him
adieu
on
leaving
for
washington
on
the
eve
of
the
late
bloody
civil
war
my
friends
no
one
not
in
my
position
can
appreciate
the
sadness
i
feel
at
this
parting
to
this
people
i
owe
all
that
i
am
here
i
have
lived
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
here
my
children
were
born
and
here
one
of
them
lies
buried
i
know
not
how
soon
i
shall
see
you
again
a
duty
devolves
on
me
which
is
greater
perhaps
than
that
which
has
devolved
upon
any
other
man
since
the
days
of
washington
he
never
would
have
succeeded
except
for
the
aid
of
divine
providence
upon
which
he
at
all
times
relied
i
feel
that
i
can
not
succeed
without
the
same
divine
aid
which
sustained
him
and
on
the
same
almighty
being
i
place
my
reliance
for
support
and
i
hope
you
my
friends
will
pray
that
i
may
receive
that
divine
assistance
without
which
i
can
not
succeed
but
with
which
success
is
certain
again
i
bid
you
all
an
affectionate
farewell
when
james
garfield
became
a
member
of
the
black
salter
family
he
found
marryatt
novels
sinbad
the
sailor
the
pirates
own
book
jack
halyard
lives
of
eminent
criminals
the
buccaneers
of
the
caribbean
seas
and
being
a
great
reader
he
sat
up
nights
to
read
these
works
their
effect
upon
him
was
to
weaken
the
ties
of
home
and
filial
affection
diminish
his
regard
for
religious
things
and
create
within
him
an
intense
desire
for
a
seafaring
life
nothing
but
a
long
and
painful
sickness
together
with
the
wise
counsels
of
his
mother
and
a
popular
teacher
saved
him
from
a
wild
and
reckless
life
upon
the
sea
by
leading
him
to
christ
and
a
nobler
life
in
consequence
of
which
his
public
career
was
one
of
honor
and
closed
in
the
highest
office
of
the
land
neither
lincoln
nor
garfield
would
have
been
president
of
the
united
states
if
the
spell
with
which
the
influence
of
corrupt
books
bound
them
for
the
time
had
not
been
broken
by
juster
views
of
real
life
and
nobler
aims
xviii
how
he
quit
boston
i
tell
you
how
it
is
john
exclaimed
benjamin
under
great
excitement
i
have
withstood
my
brother
ill
treatment
as
long
as
i
am
going
to
i
shall
leave
him
how
is
that
ben
i
thought
your
brother
would
treat
you
with
more
consideration
after
you
immortalized
yourself
as
an
editor
i
knew
you
had
a
hard
time
with
him
before
the
was
started
john
collins
knew
somewhat
of
benjamin
troubles
the
first
two
years
of
his
apprenticeship
he
has
been
worse
since
my
prominence
on
the
that
is
at
times
i
think
my
success
aroused
his
jealousy
so
that
it
fretted
him
to
see
me
his
apprentice
occupy
a
higher
position
than
himself
once
in
a
while
he
has
seemed
to
be
pleased
with
my
prominence
on
the
paper
and
then
again
it
annoyed
him
i
should
think
you
had
helped
him
out
of
trouble
enough
to
stir
up
his
gratitude
a
little
even
if
he
had
no
pride
in
possessing
so
bright
a
brother
brother
brother
exclaimed
benjamin
he
never
thought
of
that
relation
i
was
his
apprentice
to
be
lorded
over
until
years
of
age
i
do
not
think
he
would
have
treated
the
greatest
stranger
as
an
apprentice
more
unkindly
than
he
has
me
he
seemed
to
think
that
the
relation
of
master
to
an
apprentice
obliterates
all
blood
relationship
that
is
unfortunate
for
both
of
you
remarked
john
but
most
unfortunate
for
him
whom
public
opinion
will
judge
as
a
brother
and
not
as
a
master
but
how
will
you
get
along
with
your
indenture
if
you
leave
him
i
am
justified
by
the
circumstances
in
using
the
indenture
on
the
back
of
which
is
his
own
endorsement
of
my
freedom
he
released
me
from
all
obligations
to
him
that
i
might
run
the
paper
when
he
could
not
but
the
understanding
between
you
was
if
i
remember
that
it
was
only
a
formality
to
evade
the
action
of
the
general
court
he
did
not
mean
that
you
should
take
advantage
of
it
and
refuse
to
serve
him
that
is
true
but
i
say
the
circumstances
justify
me
in
using
it
as
if
he
really
meant
to
give
me
my
freedom
he
has
another
indenture
which
i
signed
designed
to
be
kept
private
but
he
wo
dare
to
bring
that
out
to
the
light
of
day
because
it
may
get
him
into
further
trouble
with
the
general
court
you
have
the
advantage
of
him
there
i
see
if
you
see
fit
to
avail
yourself
of
it
does
james
know
how
you
feel
about
it
he
ought
to
know
for
i
have
told
him
that
i
should
leave
him
if
he
continued
to
treat
me
as
he
has
done
probably
he
does
not
believe
that
i
shall
quit
but
i
am
not
responsible
for
that
he
ought
to
see
that
such
treatment
would
cause
any
apprentice
to
leave
his
master
what
does
he
do
that
is
so
bad
inquired
john
he
undertook
to
flog
me
the
other
day
he
did
strike
me
but
i
showed
him
that
i
believed
in
and
he
desisted
he
has
beaten
me
often
i
did
not
like
the
looks
of
an
elder
brother
licking
a
younger
one
and
so
i
put
myself
in
a
position
to
make
such
a
scene
impossible
well
i
do
not
think
that
such
a
scene
is
particularly
attractive
responded
john
in
his
droll
way
such
a
scene
in
the
theatre
would
be
tragedy
i
think
it
could
not
be
comedy
in
a
civilized
land
that
is
no
worse
than
other
things
he
does
if
he
would
get
mad
and
beat
me
and
then
be
kind
and
considerate
for
a
while
i
should
be
quite
well
satisfied
but
he
is
constantly
domineering
over
me
as
if
he
meant
i
should
realize
all
the
while
that
he
is
my
legal
master
does
your
father
know
about
it
yes
and
he
has
been
decidedly
in
my
favor
until
now
we
have
often
laid
our
differences
before
him
and
in
nearly
every
instance
he
has
supported
me
but
for
some
reason
since
the
last
trouble
he
has
upheld
james
perhaps
it
was
because
i
did
not
allow
james
to
beat
me
as
masters
often
do
their
apprentices
what
do
you
propose
to
do
if
you
leave
your
brother
continued
john
go
to
new
york
i
can
find
work
there
if
there
is
nothing
there
for
an
extra
printer
to
do
i
will
turn
my
hand
to
something
else
i
shall
leave
boston
why
not
get
into
one
of
the
other
printing
offices
in
town
i
do
not
want
you
should
quit
boston
until
i
do
for
two
good
reasons
the
first
is
that
my
connection
with
the
stirred
up
the
officials
of
the
government
so
that
i
am
obnoxious
to
them
and
the
second
is
that
my
religious
opinions
have
become
so
well
known
and
have
been
so
misrepresented
that
ministers
and
other
good
people
consider
me
no
better
than
an
atheist
i
prefer
to
go
among
strangers
where
i
can
have
a
chance
to
make
a
record
for
myself
better
make
a
record
here
the
best
chance
in
the
world
here
people
know
who
you
are
or
they
ought
to
know
by
this
time
take
my
advice
and
secure
a
place
in
another
printing
office
in
boston
the
result
of
this
interview
with
john
was
that
benjamin
resolved
to
secure
a
position
in
boston
if
he
could
but
when
he
applied
subsequently
for
a
situation
each
printer
declined
to
employ
him
james
had
been
to
them
anticipating
that
he
might
take
this
step
and
warned
them
against
making
any
bargain
with
him
he
assured
them
that
he
should
take
legal
steps
under
the
indenture
of
apprenticeship
to
maintain
his
rights
if
they
employed
him
besides
he
told
them
that
benjamin
did
not
believe
the
christian
religion
and
he
had
no
respect
for
those
who
did
that
in
short
he
was
no
better
than
an
atheist
james
meant
to
compel
benjamin
to
continue
to
work
for
him
and
he
thought
if
no
other
printer
would
hire
him
that
would
end
the
trouble
but
the
opposite
effect
was
produced
it
determined
benjamin
to
quit
boston
as
soon
as
he
could
arrange
for
the
change
though
he
did
not
make
known
his
decision
to
his
brother
probably
his
brother
did
not
dream
of
his
leaving
boston
for
new
york
or
any
other
place
however
benjamin
embraced
the
first
opportunity
to
announce
to
him
that
he
should
quit
i
am
my
own
man
from
this
time
he
cried
holding
up
his
indenture
which
his
brother
had
returned
to
him
this
paper
makes
me
free
and
i
shall
take
advantage
of
it
to
leave
you
and
he
shook
the
document
in
james
face
you
know
that
i
never
gave
up
the
indenture
because
i
relinquished
the
bargain
we
had
made
if
you
use
it
to
assert
and
establish
your
freedom
you
will
be
guilty
of
a
mean
contemptible
act
i
shall
so
use
it
and
benjamin
was
very
defiant
when
he
said
it
i
have
borne
your
abuse
long
enough
and
i
will
bear
it
no
longer
we
shall
see
about
that
father
will
have
a
word
to
say
about
it
you
will
find
you
are
not
of
age
yet
james
spoke
with
remarkable
coolness
for
him
in
the
circumstances
he
probably
realized
that
benjamin
had
the
advantage
of
him
neither
father
nor
any
other
man
can
force
me
to
work
for
you
any
longer
you
have
even
been
around
to
other
printers
to
influence
them
not
to
employ
me
and
you
have
lied
about
me
telling
them
that
i
am
an
atheist
and
other
things
as
bad
i
told
them
nothing
but
the
truth
replied
james
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
you
believe
shaftesbury
instead
of
the
bible
well
no
matter
what
i
believe
i
shall
not
work
for
you
another
day
i
will
resort
to
the
most
menial
employment
for
my
bread
and
butter
before
i
will
serve
a
man
who
will
treat
his
own
brother
like
a
slave
and
again
benjamin
flourished
his
indenture
before
the
eyes
of
james
defiantly
it
was
not
fair
in
benjamin
to
take
this
advantage
of
his
brother
and
he
knew
it
but
his
resentment
triumphed
over
his
regard
for
right
at
the
time
james
returned
his
indenture
only
that
he
might
be
able
to
publish
the
unmolested
it
was
a
deceitful
arrangement
in
the
first
place
and
benjamin
use
of
the
indenture
to
assert
his
liberty
was
no
more
unfair
and
sinful
than
was
james
device
to
make
him
the
proprietor
of
the
paper
and
thus
evade
the
law
james
was
paid
in
his
own
coin
he
laid
a
plan
to
cheat
the
government
and
he
got
cheated
himself
he
was
snared
in
the
work
of
his
own
hands
this
however
did
not
justify
benjamin
in
his
course
as
he
afterwards
saw
and
frankly
confessed
in
his
autobiography
he
said
at
length
a
fresh
difference
arising
between
my
brother
and
me
i
took
upon
me
to
assert
my
freedom
presuming
that
he
would
not
venture
to
produce
the
new
indentures
it
was
not
fair
in
me
to
take
this
advantage
and
this
i
therefore
reckon
one
of
the
first
of
my
life
but
the
unfairness
of
it
weighed
little
with
me
when
under
the
impressions
of
resentment
for
the
blows
his
passion
too
often
urged
him
to
bestow
upon
me
though
he
was
otherwise
not
an
man
perhaps
i
was
too
saucy
and
provoking
there
is
no
doubt
that
benjamin
erred
in
the
matter
he
was
by
nature
headstrong
and
independent
and
perhaps
he
was
more
on
account
of
his
success
in
the
business
but
after
all
allowances
are
made
james
must
be
regarded
as
the
chief
offender
in
the
troubles
and
on
him
the
responsibility
for
it
rests
in
a
large
measure
benjamin
lost
no
time
in
reporting
his
decision
to
john
i
am
going
to
new
york
as
soon
as
i
can
get
away
he
said
what
do
you
suppose
that
fellow
has
done
he
has
been
around
to
the
other
printers
and
threatened
to
enforce
his
claim
to
my
services
if
they
hire
me
and
he
lied
about
me
also
it
is
settled
that
i
shall
go
to
new
york
i
am
not
going
to
be
banged
about
any
more
well
it
seems
rather
necessary
for
you
to
go
somewhere
if
you
get
work
here
answered
john
but
how
am
i
going
to
get
along
without
you
ben
could
you
turn
your
hand
to
something
else
i
could
but
i
wo
i
am
fully
resolved
to
quit
boston
soon
and
i
am
satisfied
that
i
must
leave
clandestinely
or
i
shall
not
get
away
how
is
that
expect
that
your
brother
will
lay
violent
hands
upon
you
to
prevent
i
expect
that
he
and
father
together
will
prevent
my
leaving
if
possible
have
you
spoken
with
your
father
about
it
no
i
have
not
nor
do
i
intend
to
he
sides
with
james
now
and
that
is
enough
for
me
i
shall
say
nothing
to
him
about
the
matter
perhaps
he
thinks
you
will
leave
boston
if
you
leave
james
suggested
john
he
may
think
that
you
will
clear
out
and
go
to
sea
he
has
not
forgotten
your
old
hankering
for
a
life
on
the
wave
possibly
but
i
have
no
desire
now
to
go
to
sea
i
have
a
trade
that
i
like
and
i
shall
stick
to
it
until
i
am
forced
out
of
it
how
do
you
propose
to
get
to
new
york
got
any
plans
ahead
yes
a
plan
is
all
that
i
have
got
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
i
can
carry
it
out
i
do
not
think
i
can
accomplish
my
purpose
without
your
help
i
am
at
your
service
now
ben
as
ever
before
only
i
would
like
to
understand
just
what
i
can
do
that
is
what
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
i
am
not
yet
clear
as
to
my
best
way
of
escape
if
i
go
by
land
on
foot
they
may
send
officers
after
me
and
overtake
me
before
i
get
half
way
there
of
course
it
would
be
poor
policy
for
you
to
go
by
land
if
you
can
possibly
go
by
water
there
is
a
new
york
sloop
in
the
harbor
and
no
doubt
it
will
return
soon
but
how
can
i
get
aboard
the
captain
will
want
to
know
who
i
am
and
if
he
knows
that
i
am
a
runaway
apprentice
he
will
refuse
me
a
passage
i
can
manage
that
said
john
i
know
the
captain
and
i
think
i
can
arrange
with
him
to
take
you
yes
but
he
will
want
large
pay
for
it
of
course
he
will
not
take
me
to
new
york
without
some
money
arrangement
and
i
have
precious
little
money
to
give
him
you
can
sell
some
of
your
books
suggested
john
you
will
not
take
them
to
new
york
with
you
and
you
can
sell
them
readily
that
is
a
good
idea
john
i
will
reduce
it
to
practice
at
once
i
shall
not
want
much
money
anyway
but
suppose
the
captain
is
very
inquisitive
about
me
how
will
you
get
along
with
the
case
he
must
be
somewhat
suspicious
when
a
boston
boy
wants
to
be
taken
to
new
york
on
the
sly
you
leave
that
to
me
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
can
smuggle
you
through
he
shall
not
know
even
that
your
name
is
franklin
well
then
i
will
commit
myself
to
your
care
see
that
you
manage
adroitly
even
if
you
have
to
make
a
package
of
me
for
transportation
i
am
going
to
new
york
if
i
am
obliged
to
walk
there
i
will
go
to
see
the
captain
at
once
ben
and
i
will
be
back
with
my
report
in
two
hours
be
on
hand
and
see
if
i
do
not
make
a
good
bargain
for
your
passage
you
always
have
succeeded
and
i
think
you
will
succeed
now
be
off
then
in
a
jiffy
and
i
will
run
out
to
see
where
i
can
dispose
of
my
books
i
will
be
back
in
two
hours
and
meet
you
here
they
parted
and
john
hurried
away
to
see
the
captain
he
found
him
on
board
his
sloop
can
you
take
a
friend
of
mine
to
new
york
he
asked
that
depends
on
circumstances
replied
the
captain
who
is
your
friend
ca
take
a
pauper
or
a
criminal
you
know
he
is
neither
one
nor
the
other
he
is
a
young
man
about
my
age
a
printer
by
trade
and
he
is
going
to
new
york
to
find
work
why
does
he
find
work
in
boston
there
are
more
printers
in
boston
than
there
are
in
new
york
that
may
be
but
he
prefers
to
work
in
new
york
he
tired
of
boston
perhaps
boston
is
tired
of
him
is
that
so
i
want
to
accommodate
but
i
do
want
to
get
anybody
into
trouble
nor
get
there
myself
john
saw
that
there
was
no
evading
the
captain
questions
and
so
he
resolved
to
tell
the
false
story
he
had
thought
of
on
his
way
to
the
sloop
well
said
john
if
i
must
tell
you
the
whole
story
the
case
is
this
he
is
a
young
fellow
who
has
been
flirting
with
a
girl
who
wants
to
marry
him
and
now
her
parents
are
determined
that
he
shall
marry
her
and
he
is
as
determined
that
he
will
not
and
he
proposes
to
remove
secretly
to
new
york
he
would
have
come
to
see
you
himself
but
his
coming
might
awaken
suspicion
on
the
part
of
some
one
acquainted
with
the
affair
who
might
see
him
and
know
him
so
i
came
to
do
the
business
for
him
he
is
in
a
fix
sure
answered
the
captain
if
there
is
any
man
in
the
world
i
would
help
it
is
the
man
who
is
trying
to
escape
from
the
girl
he
do
want
to
marry
how
much
will
he
pay
for
his
passage
he
will
pay
your
price
if
it
is
reasonable
he
is
not
a
pauper
though
he
has
not
much
of
a
money
surplus
he
will
satisfy
you
as
to
that
send
him
along
then
this
sloop
will
sail
on
saturday
at
two
he
better
not
come
aboard
until
just
before
we
sail
or
somebody
may
upset
his
plans
and
the
girl
get
him
after
all
all
right
he
will
be
here
on
the
mark
and
i
shall
be
with
him
to
see
him
off
answered
john
as
he
turned
upon
his
heels
to
report
his
success
to
benjamin
a
youth
who
can
fabricate
a
falsehood
so
unblushingly
as
john
did
the
foregoing
is
already
on
the
road
to
ruin
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
before
the
whole
story
is
told
that
he
became
a
miserable
reckless
sort
of
a
man
this
lie
proved
that
he
was
destitute
of
moral
principle
and
would
do
almost
any
thing
to
carry
his
point
that
the
captain
should
have
been
taken
in
by
such
a
ruse
is
inexplicable
but
no
doubt
the
thought
of
receiving
good
pay
for
his
passage
led
him
to
receive
the
passenger
it
was
so
much
gain
to
receive
a
few
dollars
from
an
unexpected
source
the
bargain
is
made
and
your
passage
to
new
york
is
assured
exclaimed
john
to
benjamin
when
they
met
at
the
end
of
two
hours
have
any
trouble
to
accomplish
it
you
did
not
awaken
his
suspicion
did
you
replied
benjamin
evidently
relieved
of
considerable
anxiety
by
the
announcement
no
trouble
of
course
i
did
not
mean
to
have
any
if
lying
would
prevent
it
then
you
had
to
resort
to
falsehood
to
carry
your
point
did
you
how
was
that
john
well
you
see
he
questioned
me
pretty
closely
and
seemed
to
be
suspicious
that
you
might
be
a
pauper
or
criminal
he
would
want
to
carry
you
if
you
were
a
pauper
for
he
would
get
no
pay
for
it
and
he
would
not
carry
a
criminal
for
fear
of
getting
into
trouble
with
the
authorities
so
i
had
to
originate
a
little
love
story
in
which
you
are
represented
as
fleeing
from
a
girl
and
her
parents
who
are
determined
that
you
shall
marry
her
you
are
more
original
than
i
thought
you
were
john
you
might
write
a
novel
out
of
the
affair
yes
and
it
would
be
no
worse
than
half
the
novels
that
are
written
rejoined
john
i
had
a
plot
to
get
you
to
new
york
and
the
novel
writer
often
has
a
plot
that
is
not
half
so
important
nor
half
so
much
truth
in
it
how
soon
will
the
sloop
sail
next
saturday
at
two
in
the
afternoon
so
you
will
not
have
to
wait
long
you
must
not
go
aboard
until
just
before
the
sloop
sails
for
the
girl
might
get
wind
of
it
and
be
after
you
the
captain
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
her
he
evidently
do
want
you
to
fall
into
her
hands
benjamin
laughed
at
this
way
of
putting
the
matter
and
in
the
circumstances
was
not
disposed
to
criticise
john
method
but
he
inquired
how
about
the
price
to
be
paid
for
the
passage
that
is
left
for
you
and
him
to
adjust
replied
john
i
told
him
that
you
was
not
with
money
but
had
enough
to
pay
him
for
your
passage
how
about
your
books
can
you
sell
them
yes
and
quite
as
favorably
as
i
had
supposed
i
see
nothing
why
i
shall
not
be
all
ready
for
the
sloop
on
saturday
i
will
send
my
chest
of
clothes
down
just
before
i
go
myself
i
will
be
on
hand
to
go
to
the
sloop
with
you
said
john
as
they
parted
each
with
a
clear
understanding
as
to
the
future
the
plan
was
carried
out
to
the
letter
and
benjamin
and
john
were
on
their
way
to
the
sloop
in
due
time
tell
no
tales
out
of
school
remarked
benjamin
i
prefer
that
no
one
should
know
my
whereabouts
at
present
they
will
find
out
nothing
from
me
i
shall
be
profoundly
ignorant
of
your
movements
answered
john
perhaps
i
shall
be
the
most
astonished
person
in
boston
over
your
sudden
departure
there
no
telling
but
i
shall
want
to
hear
from
you
ben
ca
you
write
make
any
pledges
i
shall
want
to
hear
from
you
as
much
as
you
will
from
me
and
a
little
more
i
guess
for
i
shall
want
to
hear
what
is
said
and
done
about
my
unauthorized
departure
i
suppose
that
a
can
not
expect
many
favorable
remarks
perhaps
the
will
say
that
the
editor
of
the
has
run
away
suggested
john
in
a
vein
of
pleasantry
there
will
be
considerable
more
truth
in
that
than
i
told
the
captain
it
is
rather
of
a
singular
occurrence
however
ben
that
so
popular
an
editor
as
you
have
been
should
be
running
away
from
the
editorial
chair
by
this
time
the
sloop
was
boarded
and
the
captain
was
almost
ready
to
sail
my
friend
said
john
to
the
captain
presenting
benjamin
you
will
find
him
good
company
he
is
no
fool
or
knave
he
might
be
a
goner
if
that
girl
should
be
after
him
before
we
get
under
way
suggested
the
captain
however
we
soon
be
off
good
luck
to
you
old
friend
said
john
as
he
shook
hands
with
benjamin
we
shall
be
nigh
each
other
though
three
hundred
miles
apart
john
a
thousand
thanks
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
replied
benjamin
with
a
heavy
heart
just
beginning
to
feel
that
he
was
going
away
from
home
thus
they
parted
and
the
sloop
sailed
for
new
york
benjamin
avoided
conversation
with
the
captain
as
much
as
was
possible
lest
he
might
ask
questions
it
would
be
embarrassing
to
answer
the
captain
too
refrained
from
too
much
freedom
with
his
youthful
passenger
lest
he
might
make
it
painful
for
him
now
that
he
was
running
away
from
a
girl
the
sloop
was
becalmed
off
block
island
for
several
hours
when
the
sailors
resorted
to
catching
cod
for
a
pastime
and
slapping
them
down
one
after
another
on
the
deck
cruel
inhumanity
cried
benjamin
who
entertained
the
singular
idea
that
it
was
murder
to
take
the
life
of
any
harmless
creature
and
for
this
reason
he
would
not
touch
animal
food
what
is
cruel
inquired
one
of
the
crew
taking
the
life
of
codfish
that
never
did
you
any
harm
pshaw
exclaimed
the
captain
how
you
goin
to
eat
before
you
catch
do
eat
them
and
then
there
will
be
no
need
of
catching
them
responded
benjamin
they
are
in
their
native
element
now
let
them
stay
there
and
you
keep
in
yours
they
are
in
as
great
misery
on
this
deck
as
you
would
be
down
there
in
the
water
what
put
such
a
queer
notion
as
that
into
your
head
said
the
captain
who
was
surprised
that
a
sane
man
should
hold
such
an
opinion
do
eat
fish
no
nor
any
other
kind
of
meat
i
have
not
touched
a
particle
for
more
than
two
years
because
you
think
it
is
wicked
to
kill
harmless
animals
of
any
kind
remarked
another
sailor
who
had
been
listening
in
utter
astonishment
yes
that
is
the
principal
reason
though
i
do
not
think
that
man
needs
flesh
for
a
diet
you
think
that
god
made
beasts
birds
and
fish
to
look
at
and
not
to
eat
suggested
the
captain
in
my
opinion
the
world
would
be
overrun
with
dumb
animals
in
time
if
none
were
killed
for
food
and
i
think
the
human
family
would
perish
for
want
of
food
if
flesh
were
denied
them
added
one
of
the
crew
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
the
cook
was
frying
fresh
cod
and
the
sailors
were
enjoying
the
odor
therefrom
do
they
smell
good
said
one
addressing
benjamin
i
want
to
risk
you
with
one
of
those
fellows
if
there
was
no
more
than
i
wanted
i
once
ate
fish
and
had
a
special
liking
for
them
and
they
smell
well
enough
now
in
the
replied
benjamin
but
i
have
my
own
opinions
about
killing
such
animals
i
should
think
you
had
responded
one
of
the
sailors
laughing
no
one
else
would
ever
think
of
such
a
thing
soon
the
whole
crew
were
eating
cod
and
in
the
jolliest
manner
making
remarks
at
benjamin
expense
look
here
my
friend
said
the
cook
when
these
fish
were
opened
i
found
smaller
ones
in
their
stomachs
now
if
they
can
eat
one
another
i
do
see
why
we
ca
eat
them
do
you
you
must
be
joking
young
man
continued
the
captain
better
send
all
such
notions
adrift
and
sit
down
with
us
to
dine
on
fish
they
are
splendid
one
and
another
remarked
keeping
up
a
continual
fire
at
benjamin
with
jokes
and
arguments
and
ridicule
until
he
sat
down
and
went
to
devouring
a
cod
with
the
rest
of
them
that
was
the
end
of
his
queer
notion
about
killing
fish
it
was
buried
there
in
the
sea
and
benjamin
never
again
resurrected
it
but
ate
what
other
people
did
but
the
episode
furnished
sport
for
the
sailors
all
the
way
from
block
island
to
new
york
where
they
arrived
in
about
three
days
from
the
time
the
sloop
left
boston
benjamin
did
not
know
a
person
in
the
city
of
new
york
nor
had
he
a
single
letter
of
recommendation
to
any
one
and
the
money
in
his
pocket
but
a
trifle
it
was
in
october
that
he
arrived
in
new
york
a
youth
of
seventeen
years
a
runaway
in
a
city
without
a
solitary
acquaintance
and
scarcely
money
enough
to
pay
a
board
perhaps
with
all
the
rest
he
carried
an
upbraiding
conscience
under
his
jacket
more
discomforting
than
to
be
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
at
this
crisis
of
benjamin
life
he
appeared
to
be
on
the
highway
to
ruin
there
is
scarcely
one
similar
case
in
ten
where
the
runaway
escapes
the
vortex
of
degradation
benjamin
would
have
been
no
exception
but
for
his
early
religious
training
and
his
love
of
books
the
case
of
william
hutton
who
was
the
son
of
very
poor
parents
is
very
similar
to
that
of
benjamin
franklin
he
was
bound
to
his
uncle
for
a
series
of
years
but
he
was
treated
so
harshly
that
he
ran
away
at
seventeen
years
of
age
the
record
is
that
on
the
day
of
july
the
he
received
from
his
uncle
in
the
shape
of
a
brutal
flogging
with
a
handle
of
white
hazel
which
almost
killed
him
caused
him
to
run
away
a
dark
prospect
was
before
him
since
he
had
only
twopence
in
his
pocket
a
spacious
world
before
him
and
no
plan
of
operation
yet
he
became
an
author
of
much
celebrity
and
a
most
exemplary
and
influential
man
he
lived
to
the
age
of
ninety
his
last
days
being
gladdened
by
the
reflection
of
having
lived
a
useful
life
and
the
consciousness
of
sharing
the
confidence
of
his
this
description
of
hutton
would
apply
almost
equally
well
to
franklin
xix
trials
of
a
runaway
on
arriving
at
new
york
benjamin
first
thought
was
of
work
his
pocket
was
too
near
empty
to
remain
idle
long
so
he
called
upon
william
bradford
an
old
printer
who
removed
from
philadelphia
to
new
york
some
months
before
can
i
find
employment
in
your
printing
office
he
inquired
i
am
not
in
need
of
extra
help
i
am
sorry
to
say
answered
bradford
my
business
is
light
and
will
continue
to
be
so
for
the
present
i
think
are
you
a
printer
yes
sir
i
have
worked
at
the
business
over
three
years
where
in
boston
you
ought
to
understand
it
well
by
this
time
i
wish
i
had
work
for
you
or
for
any
other
young
man
who
is
enterprising
enough
to
go
from
boston
to
new
york
for
work
do
you
think
i
should
be
likely
to
find
work
at
some
other
printing
office
in
town
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
hardly
think
you
can
very
dull
times
indeed
my
son
but
i
think
you
can
get
work
in
philadelphia
my
son
runs
a
printing
house
in
that
city
and
one
of
his
men
on
whom
he
relied
much
recently
died
i
think
he
would
be
glad
to
employ
you
how
far
is
it
to
philadelphia
about
a
hundred
miles
a
long
distance
was
benjamin
reply
evidently
disappointed
to
find
that
he
was
still
a
hundred
miles
from
work
it
is
only
as
far
as
you
have
already
traveled
for
work
if
you
can
find
employment
by
traveling
a
hundred
miles
further
in
these
dull
times
you
will
be
fortunate
well
i
suppose
that
is
so
replied
benjamin
musing
on
his
situation
what
is
the
conveyance
there
you
can
take
a
boat
to
amboy
and
there
you
will
find
another
boat
to
philadelphia
a
pleasant
trip
on
the
whole
and
bradford
added
for
benjamin
encouragement
philadelphia
is
a
better
place
for
a
printer
than
new
york
in
some
respects
benjamin
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
expressing
much
pleasure
in
making
his
acquaintance
and
bade
him
he
took
the
first
boat
to
amboy
sending
his
chest
by
sea
around
to
philadelphia
the
more
he
reflected
upon
his
situation
in
connection
with
encouraging
words
the
more
cheerful
and
hopeful
he
grew
if
he
could
get
work
by
going
a
hundred
miles
further
he
ought
to
be
well
satisfied
he
said
to
himself
so
he
cheered
up
his
almost
desponding
heart
in
franklin
fashion
as
he
proceeded
upon
the
next
hundred
miles
but
more
trials
awaited
him
however
somewhat
different
from
those
already
experienced
the
boat
had
been
under
way
but
a
short
time
before
it
was
struck
by
a
sudden
squall
tearing
the
rotten
sails
to
pieces
and
driving
the
craft
upon
long
island
it
was
the
first
squall
of
that
sort
benjamin
had
ever
experienced
other
squalls
had
struck
him
and
he
was
fleeing
from
one
at
that
time
but
this
squall
of
wind
and
rain
was
altogether
a
new
experience
and
he
wilted
under
it
the
condition
was
made
more
tragic
by
a
drunken
dutchman
falling
overboard
seize
him
seize
him
cried
the
captain
and
that
was
what
benjamin
was
waiting
to
do
when
the
miserable
fellow
should
rise
to
the
surface
as
soon
as
he
came
up
from
the
depths
into
which
he
had
sunk
benjamin
seized
him
by
the
hair
of
his
head
and
pulled
him
on
board
there
you
fool
exclaimed
benjamin
i
hope
that
ducking
will
sober
you
you
came
within
sight
of
eternity
that
time
he
may
thank
you
for
saving
his
life
remarked
one
of
the
boatmen
he
is
too
drunk
for
that
replied
benjamin
he
will
never
know
how
near
he
came
to
his
own
place
strange
that
any
man
will
be
so
foolish
as
to
drink
stuff
that
will
steal
away
his
brains
do
you
ever
drink
it
asked
the
captain
in
reply
not
one
drop
his
young
passenger
replied
with
emphasis
as
he
rolled
over
the
dutchman
to
get
the
water
out
of
him
there
are
you
all
right
now
the
dutchman
mumbled
over
something
no
one
could
tell
what
it
was
probably
about
a
book
in
his
jacket
for
he
took
one
therefrom
and
signified
to
benjamin
that
he
wanted
it
dried
and
then
he
dropped
into
a
sound
sleep
i
declare
if
it
is
not
my
old
friend
the
pilgrim
progress
exclaimed
benjamin
in
dutch
too
a
queer
companion
for
a
drunken
man
to
have
though
a
good
one
knows
more
about
the
bottle
than
he
does
about
that
i
bet
said
the
captain
i
do
suppose
that
it
makes
much
difference
to
him
whether
he
is
under
the
water
or
on
top
not
just
now
replied
benjamin
but
what
chance
is
there
for
landing
on
such
a
rocky
shore
not
much
we
drop
anchor
and
swing
out
the
cable
towards
the
shore
said
the
captain
i
see
men
on
the
shore
and
there
are
boats
there
perhaps
they
can
come
to
our
rescue
though
the
wind
is
blowing
a
little
too
hard
for
them
the
captain
hallooed
to
them
and
they
returned
an
answer
but
the
wind
howled
so
that
they
could
not
be
understood
a
boat
a
boat
shouted
the
captain
others
of
the
crew
joined
in
the
call
for
aid
and
made
various
signs
indicating
their
need
of
assistance
but
neither
party
could
understand
the
other
what
now
inquired
benjamin
when
he
saw
the
men
on
shore
turning
their
steps
homeward
a
pretty
dark
night
before
us
yes
dark
and
perilous
though
i
have
seen
a
worse
one
answered
the
captain
when
we
find
ourselves
in
such
a
predicament
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
what
is
that
asked
benjamin
who
was
quite
nervous
and
anxious
do
nothing
but
wait
patiently
for
the
wind
to
abate
the
captain
was
cool
and
when
he
spoke
then
let
us
turn
in
with
the
dutchman
said
one
of
the
boatmen
i
do
want
he
should
have
all
the
sleep
there
is
he
is
not
in
condition
to
appreciate
it
as
i
am
as
you
please
said
the
captain
might
as
well
improve
the
time
by
getting
a
little
rest
we
shall
be
all
right
in
the
morning
so
all
crowded
into
the
hatches
including
benjamin
but
the
spray
broke
over
the
head
of
the
boat
so
much
that
the
water
leaked
through
upon
them
a
wet
berth
for
you
friend
said
one
of
the
boatmen
to
benjamin
you
are
not
accustomed
to
sleeping
in
such
wet
blankets
you
may
get
as
wet
as
the
dutchman
before
morning
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
in
these
circumstances
said
benjamin
in
reply
take
things
as
they
come
and
make
the
best
of
it
if
you
can
added
the
boatman
in
a
suggestive
way
if
can
i
oughter
i
been
in
this
business
longer
than
you
have
lived
the
crew
slept
soundly
but
benjamin
found
no
rest
in
such
an
unusual
plight
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
and
he
had
all
the
more
time
to
and
his
active
mind
improved
the
opportunity
so
that
boston
home
the
printing
office
and
his
parents
were
dwelt
upon
until
he
began
to
think
he
was
too
dear
for
the
again
it
is
not
strange
that
runaways
feel
thus
sooner
or
later
since
few
of
them
ever
realize
their
anticipations
the
cold
dreary
night
wore
away
slowly
and
the
wind
continued
to
howl
and
the
breakers
to
dash
and
rear
until
after
the
dawn
of
morning
benjamin
was
never
more
rejoiced
to
see
daylight
than
he
was
after
that
dismal
and
perilous
night
it
was
the
more
pleasant
to
him
because
the
wind
began
to
abate
and
there
was
a
fairer
prospect
of
reaching
their
destination
as
soon
as
the
tumult
of
the
winds
and
waves
had
subsided
they
weighed
anchor
and
steered
for
amboy
where
they
arrived
just
before
night
having
been
thirty
hours
on
the
water
without
victuals
or
any
drink
but
a
bottle
of
filthy
rum
in
the
evening
benjamin
found
himself
feverish
having
taken
a
severe
cold
by
the
exposure
of
the
previous
night
with
a
hot
head
and
a
heavy
heart
he
retired
to
rest
first
however
drinking
largely
of
cold
water
because
he
had
somewhere
read
that
cold
water
was
good
for
fever
this
was
one
of
the
advantages
he
derived
from
his
early
habit
of
reading
but
for
his
taste
for
reading
which
led
him
to
spend
his
leisure
moments
in
poring
over
books
he
might
never
have
known
this
important
fact
that
perhaps
saved
him
a
fit
of
sickness
availing
himself
of
this
knowledge
he
drank
freely
of
water
before
he
retired
and
the
result
was
a
thorough
sweating
and
he
arose
in
the
morning
fully
restored
so
as
to
continue
his
journey
a
few
years
ago
a
young
man
was
traveling
in
the
state
of
maine
soliciting
subscribers
for
a
newspaper
on
passing
a
certain
farm
he
observed
some
bricks
of
a
peculiar
color
and
he
traced
them
to
their
and
satisfied
himself
that
the
material
could
be
applied
to
a
more
valuable
purpose
than
that
of
making
bricks
he
at
once
purchased
the
farm
for
fifteen
hundred
dollars
and
on
his
return
to
boston
sold
of
it
for
four
thousand
dollars
the
secret
of
his
success
lay
in
a
bit
of
knowledge
he
acquired
at
school
he
had
given
some
attention
to
geology
and
chemistry
and
the
little
knowledge
he
had
gained
therefrom
enabled
him
to
discover
the
nature
of
the
clay
on
the
said
farm
thus
even
a
little
knowledge
that
may
be
gleaned
from
a
book
in
a
simple
leisure
will
sometimes
prove
the
way
to
a
valuable
treasure
much
more
valuable
than
the
farm
which
the
young
man
purchased
this
pecuniary
benefit
is
after
all
the
least
important
advantage
derived
from
reading
the
discipline
of
the
mind
and
heart
and
the
refined
and
elevated
pleasure
which
it
secures
are
far
more
desirable
than
any
pecuniary
advantage
gained
a
little
reading
also
as
we
have
seen
sometimes
gives
an
impulse
to
the
mind
in
the
direction
of
learning
and
renown
it
was
the
reading
of
echard
roman
history
which
gibbon
met
with
while
on
a
visit
to
miltshire
that
opened
before
him
the
historic
path
to
distinction
sir
walter
scott
warned
the
young
against
under
valuing
the
knowledge
to
be
acquired
at
odd
moments
by
reading
and
study
he
wrote
if
it
should
ever
fall
to
the
lot
of
youth
to
peruse
these
pages
let
such
readers
remember
that
it
is
with
the
deepest
regret
that
i
recollect
in
my
manhood
the
opportunities
of
learning
which
i
neglected
in
my
youth
that
through
every
part
of
my
literary
career
i
have
felt
pinched
and
hampered
by
my
own
ignorance
and
i
would
this
moment
give
half
the
reputation
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
acquire
if
by
so
doing
i
could
rest
the
remaining
part
upon
a
sound
foundation
of
learning
and
science
but
we
have
lost
sight
of
benjamin
we
left
him
at
the
tavern
in
amboy
after
having
spent
the
night
in
a
sweat
about
ready
to
start
on
his
journey
burlington
was
fifty
miles
from
amboy
and
there
was
no
public
conveyance
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
go
on
foot
expecting
to
find
a
boat
there
bound
for
philadelphia
rather
a
tough
day
for
walking
remarked
the
landlord
as
benjamin
was
leaving
his
house
better
stay
unless
your
business
is
driving
rain
or
shine
i
must
push
on
responded
benjamin
cheerfully
i
want
to
be
in
philadelphia
as
soon
as
possible
ca
melt
as
i
am
neither
sugar
nor
salt
well
that
is
a
very
encouraging
view
to
take
of
the
situation
and
it
is
a
sensible
one
too
said
the
landlord
there
nothing
like
taking
things
as
they
come
i
have
lived
long
enough
to
find
that
out
young
as
i
am
replied
benjamin
and
i
expect
to
find
constant
use
of
that
spirit
in
future
sir
good
luck
to
you
wherever
you
go
added
the
landlord
in
a
friendly
tone
benjamin
was
wet
through
before
he
had
traveled
a
mile
and
he
began
to
wish
that
he
had
never
left
boston
still
he
hastened
on
until
he
reached
a
poor
inn
about
noon
his
own
description
of
that
day
is
as
follows
it
rained
very
hard
all
the
day
i
was
thoroughly
soaked
and
by
noon
a
good
deal
tired
so
i
stopped
at
a
poor
inn
where
i
staid
all
night
now
to
wish
i
had
never
left
i
made
so
miserable
a
figure
too
that
i
found
by
the
questions
asked
me
i
was
suspected
to
be
some
runaway
indentured
servant
and
in
danger
of
being
taken
up
on
that
suspicion
where
are
you
from
young
man
from
boston
sir
ah
you
are
a
long
way
from
home
for
such
a
youngster
what
is
your
name
my
name
is
benjamin
franklin
and
i
am
going
to
philadelphia
after
work
no
work
in
boston
i
hey
how
long
since
you
left
about
a
week
i
did
not
expect
to
come
further
this
way
than
new
york
but
i
could
find
no
work
there
no
work
in
new
york
hey
what
sort
of
work
do
you
do
that
you
find
it
so
scarce
i
am
a
printer
by
trade
and
i
hope
to
get
into
a
printing
office
in
philadelphia
wall
you
are
a
pretty
young
one
to
take
such
a
trip
i
should
hardly
be
willing
my
son
should
go
so
far
from
home
printer
or
no
printer
i
can
afford
to
make
such
a
trip
and
even
a
longer
one
if
i
can
find
steady
work
suggested
benjamin
your
father
and
mother
living
yes
sir
how
did
they
feel
about
your
going
so
far
from
home
a
father
who
loves
to
work
as
well
as
my
father
does
always
wants
his
sons
to
have
enough
to
do
benjamin
replied
shrewdly
evading
the
close
question
nothing
my
father
hates
so
much
as
idleness
we
all
ought
to
hate
it
but
many
men
do
not
in
these
times
keep
above
water
without
work
the
landlord
last
words
indicated
that
his
suspicions
were
somewhat
allayed
benjamin
managed
to
answer
all
the
questions
of
the
innkeeper
without
increasing
his
suspicions
he
ate
and
slept
there
and
on
the
following
morning
proceeded
on
his
journey
and
by
night
was
within
eight
or
ten
miles
of
burlington
here
he
stopped
at
an
inn
kept
by
one
doctor
brown
an
ambulating
and
a
very
social
man
how
much
further
you
going
he
inquired
of
benjamin
i
am
going
to
philadelphia
where
are
you
from
boston
ah
i
would
like
to
see
boston
i
never
did
i
have
been
in
south
america
england
and
some
other
countries
but
i
was
never
in
boston
it
is
a
good
town
and
has
many
educated
intelligent
citizens
it
is
a
thriving
place
said
benjamin
i
should
like
to
see
as
much
of
the
world
as
you
have
i
enjoyed
it
though
my
knocking
about
subjected
me
to
many
hardships
replied
the
doctor
you
would
like
to
see
london
and
paris
and
rome
i
have
seen
them
all
they
are
marvellous
cities
i
suppose
so
my
father
came
from
england
to
boston
less
than
forty
years
ago
continued
benjamin
he
enjoys
this
country
more
than
he
did
his
own
benjamin
had
a
good
time
at
doctor
brown
the
latter
soon
discovered
that
his
youthful
guest
was
very
intelligent
so
he
entered
into
an
account
of
his
travels
abroad
somewhat
in
detail
to
interest
him
benjamin
enjoyed
the
interview
very
much
and
forgot
for
the
time
being
that
he
was
a
runaway
encountering
many
hardships
he
was
sorry
to
leave
him
on
the
next
day
i
have
enjoyed
every
minute
of
my
stay
here
he
said
and
i
shall
not
forget
it
soon
perhaps
we
shall
meet
again
sometime
i
hope
we
shall
i
am
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
i
wish
you
great
success
i
hope
you
will
become
the
most
successful
printer
in
america
they
parted
the
best
of
friends
and
benjamin
pushed
on
to
burlington
where
he
expected
to
find
a
boat
in
the
suburbs
of
the
town
he
bought
some
gingerbread
of
an
old
woman
who
kept
a
shop
and
walked
on
eating
it
as
he
went
to
his
great
disappointment
on
reaching
the
wharf
he
found
the
boat
had
gone
and
there
would
not
be
another
until
tuesday
it
was
saturday
and
his
money
would
not
hold
out
if
he
should
get
boarded
at
a
hotel
till
then
what
should
he
do
he
was
in
great
trouble
about
it
for
a
short
time
but
finally
concluded
that
he
would
return
to
the
old
lady
of
whom
he
bought
the
gingerbread
as
he
liked
her
appearance
very
well
and
ask
her
advice
so
back
he
went
ah
back
again
she
said
as
he
entered
her
shop
want
more
gingerbread
no
i
was
going
to
take
the
boat
to
philadelphia
but
it
has
gone
and
there
is
not
another
to
go
until
tuesday
lor
me
exclaimed
the
woman
if
that
ai
too
bad
what
kin
ye
du
that
is
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
there
any
other
conveyance
to
philadelphia
lor
no
and
all
ye
has
to
du
is
to
make
the
best
on
and
what
is
that
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
know
how
can
i
make
the
best
on
what
ye
goin
to
philadelphy
for
she
replied
instead
of
answering
his
question
i
am
going
after
work
i
am
a
printer
and
want
to
find
work
in
a
printing
office
a
printer
lor
dear
me
yer
fortin
is
made
to
set
up
business
in
this
town
there
nothin
of
the
like
here
i
have
nothing
to
set
up
the
business
with
said
benjamin
i
would
as
lief
work
here
as
in
philadelphia
if
the
way
was
open
the
woman
did
not
know
what
was
necessary
in
establishing
a
printing
house
that
types
and
a
press
were
indispensable
articles
in
such
business
she
did
not
dream
she
thought
doubtless
that
he
carried
all
necessary
fixtures
with
him
in
his
pockets
lor
then
i
lodge
ye
till
tuesday
for
naming
the
sum
i
will
stay
with
you
then
and
make
the
best
of
it
he
replied
he
found
himself
in
very
good
quarters
and
his
hostess
proved
herself
to
be
very
kind
and
hospitable
he
took
dinner
with
her
and
remained
about
the
shop
until
towards
night
when
he
walked
forth
to
view
the
place
in
his
walk
he
came
around
to
the
river
and
as
he
approached
it
he
discovered
a
boat
with
several
people
in
it
and
he
hailed
them
whither
bound
to
philadelphia
can
you
take
me
in
i
was
too
late
for
the
boat
just
as
well
as
not
and
the
boat
was
turned
at
once
to
receive
the
additional
passenger
there
was
no
wind
so
that
they
had
to
depend
upon
their
oars
for
progress
benjamin
now
had
an
opportunity
to
show
his
skill
in
rowing
which
he
acquired
in
his
boyhood
in
boston
he
was
so
elated
with
proceeding
on
his
journey
to
philadelphia
that
he
thought
neither
of
the
fatigue
of
rowing
nor
of
the
wonder
of
the
old
lady
in
the
shop
at
the
unexpected
disappearance
of
her
boarder
he
did
not
mean
to
treat
her
disrespectfully
for
he
considered
her
a
very
clever
woman
but
the
boat
could
not
wait
for
him
to
return
and
pay
the
old
lady
his
compliments
whether
she
ever
learned
what
became
of
him
or
that
he
grew
up
to
be
doctor
franklin
the
philosopher
and
statesman
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
doubtless
she
concluded
that
she
had
not
entertained
an
angel
unawares
but
rather
had
aided
an
undeserving
fellow
in
pursuing
a
vicious
course
which
was
not
true
the
boat
moved
on
benjamin
rowed
with
strong
resolution
taking
his
turn
with
others
and
impressing
them
by
his
tact
and
skill
until
midnight
when
one
of
the
company
said
we
must
have
passed
the
city
it
ca
be
that
we
have
been
so
long
getting
to
it
that
is
impossible
answered
one
of
the
men
we
must
have
seen
it
if
we
had
passed
it
well
i
shall
row
no
more
said
the
first
speaker
i
know
that
philadelphia
is
not
so
far
off
as
this
then
let
us
put
for
the
shore
said
a
third
and
find
out
where
we
are
if
possible
all
agreed
to
the
last
proposition
and
at
once
rowed
towards
the
shore
entering
a
small
creek
where
they
landed
near
an
old
fence
the
rails
of
which
furnished
them
fuel
for
a
fire
they
were
very
chilly
it
being
a
frosty
night
of
october
and
they
found
the
fire
very
grateful
they
remained
there
till
daylight
when
one
of
the
company
knew
that
the
place
was
cooper
creek
a
few
miles
above
philadelphia
immediately
they
made
preparations
to
continue
their
journey
which
had
not
been
altogether
unpleasant
and
they
were
soon
in
full
view
of
the
city
where
they
arrived
between
eight
and
nine
on
sunday
morning
they
landed
at
wharf
taking
out
his
money
which
consisted
of
one
unbroken
dollar
and
a
shilling
in
copper
coin
he
offered
the
latter
to
the
boatman
for
his
passage
not
a
cent
my
good
fellow
you
worked
your
passage
and
did
it
well
too
you
row
as
if
you
were
an
old
hand
at
it
put
your
money
back
in
your
pocket
but
you
take
it
insisted
benjamin
you
are
quite
welcome
to
all
the
rowing
i
have
done
i
am
glad
enough
to
get
here
by
rowing
and
paying
my
passage
too
but
for
your
coming
along
to
take
me
in
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
stay
in
burlington
until
next
tuesday
and
he
fairly
forced
the
money
upon
the
boatman
bidding
them
good
morning
he
walked
up
market
street
xx
the
walking
comedy
benjamin
was
very
hungry
and
he
was
considering
how
he
could
appease
his
hunger
when
he
met
a
boy
who
was
eating
a
piece
of
bread
that
is
what
i
want
he
said
to
the
boy
where
did
you
get
that
over
there
at
the
the
boy
replied
pointing
to
it
thank
you
and
benjamin
hurried
on
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
he
dined
with
the
in
burlington
on
the
day
before
besides
bread
was
a
staple
article
with
him
he
had
made
many
a
meal
of
plain
bread
in
his
brother
printing
office
in
boston
although
he
knew
well
which
side
his
bread
was
buttered
his
appetite
for
unbuttered
bread
never
failed
him
entering
the
he
inquired
have
you
biscuit
he
was
thinking
of
what
he
had
in
boston
we
make
nothing
of
the
kind
give
me
a
loaf
then
we
have
none
benjamin
began
to
think
he
should
have
to
go
hungry
still
for
evidently
he
did
not
know
the
names
used
to
designate
the
different
sorts
of
bread
in
philadelphia
but
soon
recovering
himself
he
said
then
give
me
worth
of
any
kind
to
his
surprise
the
baker
passed
three
great
puffy
rolls
to
him
enough
for
three
men
to
eat
at
one
meal
at
first
he
was
puzzled
to
know
what
to
do
with
them
whether
to
take
all
three
or
not
what
all
that
he
said
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
say
yes
there
worth
that
is
what
you
said
was
it
not
it
was
and
benjamin
paid
the
money
and
took
the
loaves
trying
to
conceal
his
surprise
without
exposing
his
ignorance
of
methods
in
the
quaker
city
he
was
a
boy
of
remarkable
tact
as
we
have
seen
so
that
he
was
never
put
to
his
wits
long
without
finding
a
way
out
it
was
so
in
this
case
he
put
a
roll
under
each
arm
and
taking
the
third
one
in
his
hand
he
proceeded
up
the
street
eating
as
he
went
recollect
that
it
was
sunday
morning
and
people
were
already
swarming
in
the
streets
arrayed
in
their
best
clothes
benjamin
was
clad
in
his
poorest
clothes
and
they
were
very
shabby
his
best
suit
was
in
his
chest
and
that
was
sent
from
new
york
by
water
he
was
a
sight
to
behold
as
he
trudged
up
market
street
with
his
three
loaves
of
bread
and
his
large
pockets
stuffed
with
shirts
and
stockings
he
preferred
pockets
to
the
usual
bandanna
bundle
they
were
more
convenient
for
storing
away
his
wardrobe
but
contributed
largely
to
his
comical
appearance
he
was
a
walking
comedy
people
gazed
at
him
inquiringly
and
smiled
no
doubt
many
of
them
wondered
where
he
came
from
and
where
he
was
going
he
was
seedy
enough
but
no
one
saw
the
seed
of
a
philosopher
or
statesman
about
him
there
was
no
promise
in
that
direction
he
was
an
embryo
minister
plenipotentiary
to
the
court
of
france
but
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
shack
or
modern
tramp
to
whom
sunday
is
like
all
other
days
and
whose
is
at
a
large
discount
on
he
went
however
regardless
of
opinions
concerning
the
figure
he
cut
stowing
away
in
his
stomach
the
baker
loaf
in
his
hand
he
passed
by
the
residence
of
one
read
whose
daughter
in
her
teens
miss
deborah
read
was
standing
at
the
door
she
gazed
in
wonder
at
the
singular
specimen
of
humanity
passing
before
her
thought
he
was
the
most
awkward
and
comical
creature
in
the
form
of
a
man
she
had
ever
seen
and
turned
away
with
a
laugh
to
tell
her
people
in
the
house
of
the
queer
spectacle
she
little
thought
that
she
was
taking
a
bird
eye
view
of
her
future
husband
as
the
young
man
with
the
rolls
under
his
arms
turned
out
to
be
but
just
then
he
cared
more
for
bread
than
he
did
for
her
some
years
thereafter
the
case
was
reversed
and
he
cared
more
for
her
than
he
did
for
bread
he
turned
down
chestnut
street
and
walked
on
until
he
came
round
to
the
wharf
where
he
landed
being
thirsty
he
went
to
the
boat
for
water
where
he
found
the
woman
and
child
who
came
down
the
river
with
them
on
the
previous
night
waiting
to
go
further
are
you
hungry
he
said
to
the
little
one
who
looked
wistfully
at
the
bread
we
are
both
very
hungry
replied
the
mother
quickly
for
herself
and
child
well
i
have
satisfied
my
hunger
with
one
loaf
and
you
may
have
the
other
two
if
you
want
them
and
benjamin
passed
the
two
rolls
under
his
arms
to
her
it
appears
that
in
philadelphia
worth
of
bread
is
three
times
as
much
as
a
man
can
eat
if
other
things
can
be
had
in
the
same
proportion
the
last
dollar
i
have
left
will
go
a
great
way
i
thank
you
a
thousand
times
you
are
very
kind
indeed
responded
the
woman
with
a
heart
overflowing
with
gratitude
which
was
as
good
pay
for
the
bread
as
benjamin
wanted
may
you
never
want
for
bread
no
one
would
want
for
bread
if
they
who
have
it
will
divide
with
those
who
have
none
as
they
should
in
the
last
reply
was
incorporated
a
leading
virtue
of
character
a
trait
that
manifested
itself
as
we
shall
see
all
through
his
life
his
generosity
was
equal
to
his
wisdom
an
american
statesman
said
of
him
in
a
eulogy
delivered
in
boston
no
form
of
personal
suffering
or
social
evil
escaped
his
attention
or
appealed
in
vain
for
such
relief
or
remedy
as
his
prudence
could
suggest
or
his
purse
supply
from
that
day
of
his
early
youth
when
a
wanderer
from
his
home
and
friends
in
a
strange
place
he
was
seen
sharing
the
rolls
with
a
poor
woman
and
child
to
the
last
act
of
his
public
life
when
he
signed
that
memorial
to
congress
a
spirit
of
earnest
and
practical
benevolence
runs
like
a
golden
thread
along
his
whole
career
i
must
be
after
finding
a
boarding
place
said
benjamin
to
the
owner
of
the
boat
as
he
was
about
leaving
i
do
not
know
where
to
go
any
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
are
you
acquainted
here
scarcely
at
all
could
not
be
of
any
service
to
you
any
way
on
that
line
the
owner
answered
goin
to
stop
some
time
in
philadelphy
i
am
going
to
live
here
if
i
can
find
work
as
i
expect
to
and
become
a
citizen
of
this
town
wall
you
make
a
good
one
i
know
may
you
never
have
reason
to
repent
of
your
choice
goodbye
and
benjamin
walked
up
the
street
again
the
people
were
on
their
way
to
meeting
so
that
he
was
reminded
of
divine
worship
which
he
had
partially
forsaken
in
boston
being
very
tired
in
consequence
of
a
hard
time
on
the
boat
and
a
wakeful
night
he
concluded
to
follow
the
people
to
church
they
entered
a
large
and
he
followed
them
and
took
a
seat
near
the
door
his
appearance
attracted
much
attention
as
his
dress
was
not
exactly
that
of
a
quaker
and
otherwise
he
was
not
quite
of
the
quaker
type
and
it
was
a
quaker
church
in
which
he
was
but
he
wasted
no
thoughts
upon
his
apparel
and
did
not
stop
to
think
or
care
whether
he
was
arrayed
in
shoddy
or
fine
linen
whether
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
in
a
quaker
congregation
or
knowing
that
fact
was
ignorant
of
the
quaker
worship
does
not
appear
but
he
waited
for
something
to
be
said
while
waiting
for
this
he
dropped
into
a
sound
sleep
and
slept
through
the
entire
service
and
would
have
slept
on
and
been
fastened
into
the
had
not
the
sexton
discovered
him
hulloo
stranger
meeting
over
going
to
shut
up
the
house
shouted
the
sexton
shaking
the
sleeper
thoroughly
i
was
very
tired
responded
benjamin
trying
to
get
his
eyes
open
i
was
on
the
boat
last
night
and
got
no
sleep
where
did
you
come
from
boston
i
came
here
for
work
well
philadelphy
is
a
great
place
for
work
what
sort
of
work
do
you
want
i
am
a
printer
by
trade
and
hope
to
find
work
in
a
printing
office
and
i
hope
you
will
sorry
to
disturb
your
nap
but
i
have
to
lock
up
the
house
benjamin
thanked
the
sexton
for
waking
him
instead
of
locking
him
in
and
went
out
into
the
street
he
had
not
proceeded
far
before
he
met
a
quaker
whose
face
indicated
a
man
of
amiable
and
generous
heart
and
benjamin
ventured
to
speak
to
him
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
town
arrived
here
this
morning
can
you
tell
me
where
i
can
get
a
night
lodging
certainly
i
can
i
suppose
thee
wants
a
respectable
place
the
gentleman
spoke
so
kindly
as
to
draw
benjamin
to
him
at
once
yes
sir
but
not
an
expensive
one
my
purse
will
not
permit
of
any
extra
expense
thee
going
to
remain
here
some
time
permanently
if
i
can
get
work
i
am
a
printer
by
trade
i
wish
thee
success
added
the
quaker
but
here
we
are
close
by
the
mariners
but
it
is
not
exactly
a
reputable
house
and
thee
wants
a
better
one
yes
i
want
one
that
has
a
good
reputation
if
there
is
such
a
one
said
benjamin
well
if
thee
will
follow
me
i
will
show
thee
a
better
one
it
is
not
far
away
benjamin
followed
him
into
water
street
where
he
pointed
out
a
public
house
there
the
billet
said
the
quaker
a
tavern
that
is
reputable
where
thee
can
find
board
and
lodgings
for
a
day
or
a
year
thank
you
sir
for
your
kindness
said
benjamin
i
shall
not
forget
you
may
every
body
be
as
friendly
to
you
as
you
have
been
to
me
at
the
same
time
benjamin
thought
it
was
a
very
queer
name
for
a
public
house
he
did
not
like
either
part
of
it
and
he
said
to
himself
billet
crookedness
and
a
cudgel
to
strike
down
the
turbulent
with
are
suggested
the
name
did
not
suggest
any
thing
pleasant
to
him
but
he
went
in
and
engaged
lodging
and
board
until
monday
where
are
you
from
asked
the
landlord
scanning
him
from
head
to
foot
i
am
from
boston
boston
hey
how
long
have
you
been
on
the
way
two
weeks
got
friends
in
philadelphia
not
one
all
strangers
to
me
what
did
you
come
here
for
i
came
to
secure
work
in
a
printing
office
i
am
a
printer
by
trade
how
old
are
you
seventeen
and
came
all
the
way
from
boston
alone
yes
sir
benjamin
saw
by
this
time
that
the
landlord
suspected
him
of
being
a
runaway
apprentice
this
class
of
characters
was
large
at
that
day
for
apprentices
were
often
subjected
to
cruelty
that
made
them
runaways
so
he
closed
the
conversation
as
soon
as
possible
and
went
to
his
room
where
he
slept
until
six
when
he
was
called
to
supper
not
long
after
supper
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
until
morning
he
arose
early
took
special
pains
to
make
himself
as
presentable
as
possible
paid
his
bill
without
waiting
for
breakfast
perhaps
because
he
was
reducing
his
cash
so
nearly
to
the
last
cent
and
sallied
forth
in
search
of
bradford
he
experienced
no
trouble
in
finding
the
printing
office
but
was
very
much
surprised
to
find
bradford
of
new
york
there
father
of
the
young
printer
bradford
of
philadelphia
to
whom
the
father
sent
him
glad
to
see
you
my
young
friend
i
got
here
first
after
all
as
you
see
remarked
bradford
the
father
as
he
welcomed
benjamin
with
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
had
any
on
your
way
not
exactly
bad
luck
for
i
considered
myself
quite
lucky
to
get
here
at
all
but
a
slow
tedious
trip
with
delays
and
storms
and
disappointments
most
of
the
time
was
benjamin
answer
and
he
entered
somewhat
into
details
well
you
are
here
and
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
and
now
you
want
work
then
turning
to
his
son
bradford
continued
my
son
let
me
introduce
this
young
man
to
you
he
is
a
printer
by
trade
from
boston
in
search
of
work
benjamin
franklin
he
called
upon
me
in
new
york
and
i
advised
him
to
come
to
you
knowing
that
your
leading
printer
had
died
the
young
printer
and
the
runaway
were
soon
acquainted
young
bradford
being
as
genial
and
friendly
as
the
senior
i
regret
that
i
have
no
work
for
you
now
i
have
filled
the
place
made
vacant
by
the
death
of
bolder
there
is
another
printer
here
is
there
not
asked
the
senior
bradford
yes
keimer
it
is
possible
he
may
want
a
man
but
it
is
breakfast
time
now
let
us
all
go
to
breakfast
and
then
we
see
what
can
be
done
benjamin
was
invited
to
breakfast
with
them
and
there
learned
that
bradford
of
new
york
came
all
the
way
on
horseback
starting
very
unexpectedly
the
next
day
after
benjamin
left
new
york
he
was
somewhat
surprised
also
to
learn
that
philadelphia
had
only
seven
thousand
inhabitants
at
that
time
five
thousand
less
than
boston
i
will
go
with
you
to
see
keimer
said
the
senior
bradford
after
breakfast
perhaps
i
may
be
of
service
to
you
i
shall
feel
myself
under
great
obligations
to
you
if
you
will
answered
benjamin
it
is
quite
necessary
that
i
should
get
work
as
my
money
is
nearly
gone
we
can
fix
that
i
think
said
young
bradford
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
a
little
something
to
do
if
keimer
do
want
you
so
that
you
wo
starve
you
can
lodge
at
my
house
thanks
replied
benjamin
i
appreciate
your
kindness
and
hope
to
be
able
to
make
some
return
for
it
in
the
future
i
am
sorry
not
to
appear
before
you
in
more
respectable
apparel
but
my
chest
of
clothes
comes
by
water
from
new
york
and
i
have
not
received
it
yet
clothes
do
make
the
man
responded
the
elder
bradford
who
had
discovered
a
remarkably
bright
and
intelligent
youth
in
benjamin
brains
take
the
precedence
of
clothes
in
new
york
and
philadelphia
benjamin
found
himself
among
good
friends
so
he
cheerfully
accepted
their
counsel
the
senior
bradford
accompanied
him
to
keimer
neighbor
said
bradford
i
have
brought
to
you
a
young
man
from
boston
a
printer
by
trade
he
is
after
work
perhaps
you
can
employ
him
that
depends
on
his
qualifications
answered
keimer
i
want
some
one
who
is
acquainted
with
the
business
you
will
find
him
all
right
i
think
he
appears
to
know
what
he
is
about
how
long
have
you
worked
at
the
business
inquired
keimer
turning
to
benjamin
over
three
years
do
you
understand
all
parts
of
it
so
that
you
can
go
on
with
it
yes
i
think
i
do
you
can
ascertain
by
trying
me
take
this
and
try
your
hand
let
me
see
what
you
can
do
benjamin
proceeded
to
give
an
exhibition
of
his
skill
at
which
he
did
so
rapidly
and
easily
that
keimer
was
delighted
very
well
done
indeed
i
think
you
told
the
truth
you
must
have
had
considerable
experience
i
will
employ
you
as
soon
as
i
have
sufficient
work
at
present
i
have
nothing
for
you
to
do
it
is
not
often
keimer
that
you
have
the
opportunity
to
employ
a
skilled
hand
like
this
young
man
suggested
bradford
if
you
could
give
him
enough
to
do
to
pay
his
board
until
you
are
full
of
work
it
may
be
for
your
interest
and
his
too
that
is
true
i
am
at
work
now
upon
this
elegy
on
aquila
rose
who
was
clerk
of
the
pennsylvania
legislature
and
i
may
want
him
to
print
it
i
shall
have
it
ready
in
three
or
four
days
i
am
expecting
other
work
soon
also
you
can
return
to
my
son
house
to
eat
and
sleep
said
bradford
to
benjamin
i
think
keimer
will
want
you
before
long
he
expects
to
have
business
what
do
you
think
of
my
prospects
here
sir
inquired
keimer
of
bradford
supposing
him
to
be
a
citizen
of
philadelphia
i
have
hardly
got
under
way
yet
it
is
only
a
few
weeks
since
i
began
that
will
depend
upon
your
own
exertions
and
business
talents
philadelphia
is
a
growing
town
where
industry
and
perseverance
will
do
wonders
i
shall
do
all
in
my
power
to
draw
the
business
of
the
town
and
i
think
i
can
do
it
by
industry
and
giving
work
how
can
you
expect
to
get
all
the
business
when
there
is
another
printer
here
who
has
been
established
some
time
keimer
answered
the
last
inquiry
by
disclosing
his
plans
as
bradford
artfully
drew
him
out
on
every
point
until
he
learned
how
he
was
calculating
to
command
all
the
business
and
run
his
son
out
of
it
nor
did
keimer
dream
that
he
was
conversing
with
the
father
of
the
other
printer
whom
he
designed
to
deprive
of
his
livelihood
all
the
while
benjamin
stood
and
listened
to
their
conversation
perceiving
that
bradford
was
shrewdly
learning
keimer
plans
for
the
benefit
of
his
son
you
did
not
know
that
man
did
you
inquired
benjamin
after
bradford
left
no
but
i
concluded
he
was
some
business
man
of
the
town
who
would
be
interested
to
see
a
printing
office
successful
and
so
took
pains
to
introduce
you
to
me
then
you
will
be
surprised
to
learn
who
he
is
when
i
tell
you
that
was
the
father
of
andrew
bradford
your
neighbor
the
printer
he
carries
on
printing
in
new
york
can
that
be
exclaimed
keimer
astonished
over
the
bit
of
news
and
startled
at
the
thought
of
having
made
known
his
plans
to
a
competitor
yes
it
is
even
so
that
was
bradford
the
new
york
printer
father
of
andrew
bradford
the
printer
of
your
town
and
not
his
apparition
how
in
the
world
did
he
happen
to
come
here
with
you
i
can
tell
you
in
a
few
words
replied
benjamin
i
called
on
him
for
work
in
new
york
and
he
directed
me
to
his
son
here
who
had
just
lost
a
good
hand
by
death
very
unexpectedly
on
the
next
day
he
started
for
philadelphia
on
horseback
and
when
i
called
upon
his
son
this
morning
i
found
him
there
his
son
had
just
hired
a
man
and
so
he
directed
me
to
you
and
his
father
offered
to
come
and
introduce
me
well
all
that
is
natural
enough
but
it
is
pretty
hard
on
me
answered
keimer
if
i
had
known
that
was
bradford
father
i
should
have
kept
my
mouth
shut
of
course
you
opened
it
pretty
wide
to
him
and
he
took
advantage
of
it
as
most
men
will
do
but
i
guess
no
harm
is
done
he
and
his
son
both
appear
to
be
friendly
to
you
they
would
not
have
proposed
that
i
should
come
here
for
work
if
they
had
not
been
that
looks
so
i
must
confess
said
keimer
but
i
have
learned
one
good
lesson
from
it
never
to
divulge
secrets
to
a
stranger
when
i
do
that
again
i
shall
not
be
in
my
right
mind
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
your
boston
experience
in
a
printing
office
what
office
was
you
in
my
brother
james
franklin
he
published
a
paper
the
england
he
did
a
large
business
yes
our
paper
here
gave
some
account
of
it
the
editor
had
some
trouble
with
the
government
did
he
not
yes
and
a
serious
trouble
it
was
he
believed
in
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
officials
did
not
so
there
was
a
collision
he
determined
to
fight
the
censorship
of
the
press
and
he
was
imprisoned
for
it
then
i
edited
and
published
the
paper
in
my
own
name
you
run
it
exclaimed
keimer
in
a
tone
of
wonder
and
unbelief
yes
i
run
it
without
letting
up
one
jot
in
attacking
the
intolerant
government
it
was
a
hot
contest
but
the
common
people
true
americans
rallied
to
our
support
and
left
the
aristocratic
officials
to
toady
to
the
english
government
a
new
order
of
things
when
a
boy
edits
and
publishes
a
paper
in
a
straight
fight
with
great
britain
was
all
that
keimer
said
in
reply
evidently
not
believing
a
word
of
benjamin
story
about
the
however
the
more
he
talked
with
the
new
comer
the
more
he
was
impressed
with
his
intelligence
and
manly
character
he
found
that
his
clothes
were
the
poorest
part
of
him
that
underneath
his
shabby
garments
there
dwelt
a
soul
of
large
possessions
and
aspirations
benjamin
learned
at
keimer
office
what
a
blessing
it
was
to
him
to
have
practised
things
thoroughness
in
learning
the
printer
art
as
well
as
in
studying
the
use
of
language
and
composition
characterized
him
in
boston
as
we
have
seen
now
he
was
reaping
the
benefits
of
it
he
handled
the
so
dexterously
and
answered
every
question
so
intelligently
and
promptly
that
keimer
saw
at
once
he
was
really
an
expert
many
boys
are
satisfied
if
they
can
only
pass
muster
their
ambition
rises
no
higher
than
that
but
not
so
with
benjamin
he
sought
to
understand
the
business
to
which
he
attended
and
to
do
as
well
as
possible
the
work
he
undertook
the
consequence
was
that
he
was
a
thorough
workman
and
in
five
minutes
he
was
able
to
satisfy
keimer
of
the
fact
this
was
greatly
in
his
favor
and
such
a
young
man
is
never
long
out
of
business
doctor
johnson
said
what
is
worth
doing
at
all
is
worth
doing
well
samuel
budgett
said
in
whatever
calling
a
man
is
found
he
ought
to
strive
to
be
the
best
in
that
calling
if
only
a
he
should
try
to
be
the
best
in
the
neighborhood
budgett
conducted
his
immense
business
in
which
he
employed
six
hundred
men
on
this
principle
when
a
boy
was
introduced
into
his
warehouse
he
was
set
to
straightening
old
nails
if
he
straightened
nails
well
he
was
promoted
to
if
he
did
not
do
it
well
he
was
dismissed
the
thorough
and
moved
upwards
into
larger
and
higher
fields
of
work
and
so
the
great
english
merchant
could
boast
of
having
the
most
efficient
and
faithful
class
of
employes
in
the
british
realm
training
them
to
do
their
best
did
it
james
parton
said
to
david
maydole
inventor
of
the
modern
hammer
and
manufacturer
of
the
best
hammers
in
the
world
by
this
time
you
ought
to
be
able
to
make
a
pretty
good
hammer
maydole
replied
no
i
ca
i
ca
make
a
pretty
good
hammer
i
make
the
best
made
once
a
party
applied
for
several
hammers
to
whom
maydole
was
indebted
for
some
favor
and
the
party
said
to
him
you
ought
to
make
my
hammer
a
little
better
than
the
others
maydole
responded
i
ca
make
any
better
ones
when
i
make
a
thing
i
make
it
as
well
as
i
can
no
matter
whom
it
is
for
doing
his
best
every
time
led
him
on
to
fortune
he
never
pushed
his
business
he
never
advertised
making
the
best
hammer
in
the
market
created
all
the
business
he
wanted
xxi
getting
on
your
press
is
rather
dilapidated
i
see
remarked
benjamin
to
keimer
after
he
had
looked
it
over
i
conclude
yes
i
had
to
buy
what
i
could
get
cheap
as
i
had
little
money
to
begin
with
i
guess
it
can
be
fixed
up
to
answer
my
purpose
that
is
so
it
can
be
improved
very
much
with
little
expense
replied
benjamin
do
you
understand
a
printing
press
well
enough
to
repair
it
i
can
repair
that
one
well
enough
i
see
what
is
wanted
you
ca
do
good
work
with
it
as
it
is
benjamin
answered
then
i
can
employ
you
at
once
and
you
may
go
right
about
putting
it
in
order
if
you
please
i
will
do
it
benjamin
replied
in
his
emphatic
way
it
is
not
a
long
job
by
any
means
perhaps
you
will
have
it
done
by
the
time
i
get
the
elegy
set
up
and
then
you
may
print
it
keimer
interest
was
deepening
since
he
found
that
the
boston
could
repair
a
printing
press
he
was
getting
more
than
he
bargained
for
benjamin
went
to
work
upon
the
old
press
saying
i
may
as
well
go
about
it
at
once
and
work
till
dinner
time
bradford
will
expect
me
back
then
but
i
will
keep
at
it
until
it
is
done
well
i
hope
you
will
not
expose
any
secrets
as
i
did
remarked
keimer
humorously
old
bradford
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
capital
no
doubt
see
that
he
do
make
as
much
out
of
you
as
he
did
out
of
me
benjamin
met
the
bradfords
senior
and
junior
at
the
dinner
table
where
they
gave
him
a
cordial
welcome
how
does
philadelphia
compare
with
boston
inquired
the
senior
bradford
of
him
it
is
smaller
and
i
ca
tell
yet
whether
it
is
duller
or
not
when
i
have
been
here
a
week
i
can
tell
more
about
it
and
what
are
your
prospects
at
keimer
inquired
the
junior
bradford
well
i
have
begun
to
repair
his
old
press
it
is
a
dilapidated
affair
and
i
told
him
that
i
could
improve
it
very
much
do
you
understand
that
part
of
the
business
i
understand
it
sufficiently
to
make
what
repairs
that
machine
requires
just
now
then
you
can
probably
do
some
repairs
for
me
said
the
junior
bradford
my
press
needs
some
tutoring
i
shall
be
happy
to
be
its
tutor
replied
benjamin
with
a
smile
i
shall
finish
keimer
and
then
i
will
take
yours
in
hand
i
shall
be
glad
to
do
something
to
repay
you
for
your
kindness
you
must
have
had
good
school
advantages
in
boston
remarked
the
elder
bradford
to
him
your
conversation
indicates
that
you
are
and
but
i
am
not
indebted
to
the
schools
for
it
i
never
went
to
school
but
two
years
in
my
life
but
i
have
studied
and
read
as
much
as
any
body
of
my
age
in
leisure
hours
and
nights
and
i
have
written
more
for
the
press
probably
than
any
one
of
my
age
in
boston
this
last
remark
caused
the
bradfords
to
look
at
each
other
with
wonder
for
a
moment
but
the
senior
broke
the
silence
by
saying
you
write
for
the
press
how
is
that
his
astonishment
charged
his
questions
with
peculiar
emphasis
yes
sir
i
wrote
much
for
nearly
a
year
for
the
england
one
of
the
newspapers
in
boston
and
only
seventeen
years
old
now
i
was
only
sixteen
when
i
wrote
the
most
that
was
as
far
as
benjamin
dared
to
disclose
his
history
lest
he
might
make
trouble
for
himself
he
had
disclosed
enough
however
to
set
his
host
to
thinking
neither
of
the
bradfords
really
believed
his
story
about
his
writing
for
the
press
and
yet
there
was
something
about
him
composed
of
intelligence
refinement
and
manliness
that
impressed
them
the
more
they
conversed
with
him
the
more
were
they
satisfied
that
he
was
an
uncommon
youth
while
that
conviction
awakened
their
curiosity
to
know
more
of
his
history
it
served
also
to
cause
them
to
respect
his
and
so
not
to
ply
him
with
too
many
or
close
questions
thus
benjamin
escaped
the
necessity
of
exposing
the
objectionable
part
of
his
career
and
left
his
good
friends
wondering
over
the
mysterious
young
printer
they
were
befriending
benjamin
repaired
keimer
press
and
then
attended
to
bradford
before
the
elegy
was
ready
to
be
printed
by
that
time
keimer
had
engaged
to
print
a
pamphlet
and
do
some
other
small
jobs
so
that
he
needed
benjamin
services
all
the
time
i
shall
want
you
right
along
now
i
think
but
you
must
change
your
i
do
want
you
should
board
with
a
man
who
knows
so
much
about
my
business
and
keimer
laughed
as
he
made
this
last
remark
of
course
i
shall
change
i
only
intended
to
stay
there
until
i
got
work
bradford
kindly
invited
me
to
stay
there
till
i
found
a
place
and
i
shall
not
take
any
advantage
of
his
generosity
i
shall
always
be
grateful
to
him
for
it
he
was
a
good
friend
to
you
a
stranger
continued
keimer
and
i
would
have
you
appreciate
his
friendship
but
in
the
circumstances
i
think
another
is
best
and
now
i
can
make
a
more
respectable
appearance
responded
benjamin
for
my
chest
of
clothes
has
come
the
man
who
owns
this
building
lives
a
short
distance
away
and
i
am
thinking
i
can
get
you
boarded
there
it
will
be
a
good
place
added
keimer
as
you
please
i
can
make
myself
at
home
any
where
i
am
not
used
to
much
style
and
luxury
his
name
is
read
and
he
has
an
interesting
daughter
of
eighteen
which
may
be
some
attraction
to
you
the
last
remark
was
intended
more
for
pleasantry
than
any
thing
work
will
have
to
be
the
chief
attraction
for
me
whose
fortune
is
reduced
to
the
last
shilling
responded
benjamin
it
takes
money
to
pay
respectful
attention
to
young
ladies
and
besides
my
does
not
lie
in
that
direction
the
result
was
that
he
went
to
board
at
read
the
father
of
the
young
lady
who
stood
in
the
door
when
he
passed
on
sunday
morning
with
a
roll
of
bread
under
each
arm
his
appearance
was
much
improved
by
this
time
so
that
even
miss
read
saw
that
he
was
an
intelligent
promising
young
man
benjamin
received
good
wages
attended
closely
to
his
work
improved
his
leisure
moments
by
reading
and
study
as
he
did
in
boston
and
spent
his
evenings
in
systematic
mental
culture
you
appear
to
be
fond
of
books
said
read
to
him
i
think
you
must
have
enjoyed
good
advantages
at
home
where
is
your
home
boston
i
was
born
there
seventeen
years
ago
only
seventeen
i
supposed
you
were
older
your
parents
living
yes
both
of
them
as
good
people
as
there
are
in
boston
got
brothers
and
sisters
plenty
of
them
i
am
the
fifteenth
child
and
have
two
sisters
younger
than
i
am
only
one
of
the
whole
number
is
dead
you
surprise
me
yours
must
have
been
the
largest
family
in
boston
continued
read
i
am
sure
we
have
no
family
as
large
as
that
in
philadelphia
your
father
ought
to
be
worth
some
money
to
provide
for
such
a
family
he
is
not
he
is
a
poor
man
so
poor
that
he
kept
me
in
school
less
than
two
years
i
went
into
the
shop
to
work
with
him
when
i
was
ten
years
old
and
have
not
been
to
school
since
all
my
brothers
were
apprenticed
at
ten
or
twelve
years
of
age
i
was
a
apprentice
at
twelve
years
of
age
and
what
was
your
father
business
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
ask
your
story
is
a
very
interesting
one
and
i
want
to
know
more
about
it
my
father
is
a
he
emigrated
to
boston
in
from
banbury
england
where
he
worked
at
the
trade
of
a
dyer
there
was
no
room
for
that
business
in
boston
so
he
took
up
the
business
of
but
you
did
not
work
at
the
candle
business
long
if
you
became
a
printer
at
twelve
no
i
disliked
the
business
so
thoroughly
that
i
was
ready
to
engage
in
almost
any
thing
if
i
could
get
out
of
that
the
printer
trade
has
afforded
me
excellent
opportunities
for
reading
and
study
and
i
like
it
well
printers
are
generally
an
intelligent
class
and
their
pursuit
is
highly
respected
one
of
our
printers
in
philadelphia
is
an
ignorant
man
and
not
very
familiar
with
the
business
i
found
that
out
some
time
ago
answered
benjamin
and
ignorance
is
a
great
drawback
to
a
person
in
any
business
whatever
there
is
no
need
of
a
man
being
ignorant
so
long
as
he
can
command
fragments
of
time
to
read
and
study
what
i
call
my
leisure
hours
are
my
most
profitable
and
enjoyable
hours
read
had
already
concluded
that
benjamin
was
never
so
happy
as
when
he
had
a
book
in
his
hand
or
was
with
some
intelligent
companion
conversing
upon
a
useful
topic
he
had
formed
a
high
estimate
of
his
talents
and
character
in
the
few
weeks
he
had
been
a
boarder
at
his
house
he
saw
in
him
a
rising
young
man
and
predicted
for
him
a
remarkable
career
his
daughter
too
was
as
favorably
impressed
by
acquaintance
with
him
she
learned
that
he
was
the
youth
who
cut
such
a
comical
figure
on
the
street
eating
his
roll
of
bread
on
a
sunday
morning
a
short
time
before
and
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
the
transformation
in
him
was
almost
too
great
for
belief
that
such
a
shack
in
appearance
should
turn
out
to
be
the
brightest
and
young
man
who
ever
boarded
at
her
father
was
an
impressive
fact
she
was
gratified
at
his
appearance
and
enjoyed
conversation
with
him
benjamin
was
well
pleased
with
his
and
enjoyed
himself
with
the
family
especially
with
the
daughter
who
was
rather
a
graceful
bright
girl
several
young
men
also
boarded
there
whom
he
made
companions
these
with
others
whose
acquaintance
he
made
within
three
or
four
months
became
the
source
of
so
much
pleasure
to
him
that
he
fast
became
weaned
from
boston
as
soon
as
benjamin
was
fairly
settled
in
business
he
wrote
to
his
old
friend
john
collins
of
boston
giving
him
a
full
account
of
his
trip
to
philadelphia
his
trials
and
successes
and
closing
by
charging
him
with
secrecy
as
to
his
whereabouts
he
had
given
such
unjustifiable
scope
to
his
resentment
of
his
brother
harsh
treatment
and
his
father
final
endorsement
of
that
brother
that
he
did
not
stop
to
think
of
the
sorrow
he
was
bringing
upon
his
parents
by
his
wayward
course
for
the
time
being
his
filial
affection
appeared
to
be
sacrificed
to
his
revengeful
spirit
at
that
time
the
printer
trade
ranked
higher
in
public
estimation
than
any
other
mechanical
business
all
editors
in
the
country
were
printers
and
most
of
the
printers
were
better
educated
than
any
other
artisans
hence
their
social
standing
was
higher
on
this
account
a
talented
and
brilliant
boy
like
benjamin
took
a
high
rank
at
once
and
readily
found
access
to
the
respect
and
confidence
of
all
who
made
his
acquaintance
in
due
time
benjamin
received
a
letter
from
collins
detailing
the
excitement
that
followed
his
sudden
disappearance
from
boston
what
was
said
the
sorrow
among
his
friends
over
his
disgraceful
exit
how
his
brother
was
getting
on
and
many
other
matters
about
which
he
was
glad
to
hear
the
letter
closed
by
assuring
him
that
no
person
in
boston
was
apparently
so
ignorant
of
the
runaway
whereabouts
as
himself
from
which
he
inferred
that
collins
was
keeping
the
secret
well
while
benjamin
was
flattering
himself
that
his
friends
were
entirely
ignorant
of
his
place
of
residence
except
john
collins
his
robert
homes
master
of
a
sloop
that
traded
between
boston
and
delaware
was
at
newcastle
forty
miles
from
philadelphia
there
he
met
a
citizen
of
the
latter
place
of
whom
he
made
inquiries
as
to
the
business
of
the
town
among
other
things
he
said
a
young
printer
from
boston
has
settled
there
recently
who
ranks
high
as
a
workman
and
as
a
talented
young
man
do
you
know
his
name
inquired
captain
homes
startled
by
the
revelation
benjamin
franklin
with
an
effort
to
conceal
his
surprise
and
interest
he
asked
for
whom
does
he
work
for
keimer
our
new
printer
are
you
acquainted
with
him
not
particularly
i
have
met
him
is
he
a
young
man
of
standing
and
good
habits
he
is
it
is
said
that
he
is
very
talented
and
that
he
wrote
for
the
press
in
boston
before
he
came
to
philadelphia
is
that
so
responded
the
captain
to
conceal
that
he
was
any
acquaintance
of
his
yes
and
as
a
matter
of
course
such
a
young
man
is
much
thought
of
he
is
not
set
up
at
all
but
appears
to
be
modest
and
unassuming
he
is
very
much
liked
by
all
do
you
think
he
means
to
make
philadelphia
his
home
in
the
future
that
is
what
he
intends
as
i
understand
it
in
this
way
captain
homes
gained
whatever
information
he
wanted
without
disclosing
that
benjamin
franklin
was
his
then
he
embraced
the
first
opportunity
to
write
and
forward
to
him
the
following
letter
from
newcastle
dear
brother
i
have
just
learned
from
a
citizen
of
philadelphia
that
you
reside
in
that
town
it
is
the
first
knowledge
that
any
of
us
have
had
of
your
whereabouts
since
you
ran
away
from
boston
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
sorrow
you
caused
the
family
by
your
unwise
and
thoughtless
act
it
broke
your
mother
heart
and
added
several
years
to
your
father
appearance
but
i
write
to
advise
and
entreat
you
to
return
to
boston
i
am
confident
that
your
parents
and
all
other
friends
will
receive
you
with
open
arms
forgetting
the
past
in
their
joy
over
your
presence
they
do
not
know
even
that
you
are
alive
and
your
return
will
be
to
them
as
one
risen
from
the
dead
i
trust
that
this
letter
will
find
you
well
and
disposed
to
heed
my
advice
and
go
back
to
boston
it
will
be
the
best
thing
for
you
and
the
whole
family
let
me
hear
from
you
direct
your
letter
to
this
place
if
sent
at
once
it
will
reach
me
here
yours
affectionately
robert
homes
the
reader
may
very
properly
infer
that
benjamin
was
taken
by
surprise
by
this
letter
now
his
friends
would
know
where
he
was
how
did
captain
homes
discover
his
place
of
residence
this
question
kept
uppermost
in
his
mind
his
letter
did
not
tell
benjamin
pondered
the
matter
through
the
day
and
finally
resolved
to
answer
it
squarely
and
promptly
in
the
evening
that
night
he
wrote
the
following
captain
robert
homes
i
received
your
letter
and
it
was
a
genuine
surprise
to
me
how
in
the
world
you
discovered
my
whereabouts
is
a
mystery
to
me
but
it
is
all
well
and
will
turn
out
for
the
best
no
doubt
to
answer
your
letter
affords
me
an
opportunity
to
state
exactly
the
cause
of
my
sudden
departure
from
boston
which
i
do
not
think
you
understand
the
sole
cause
of
my
leaving
was
the
unjust
and
harsh
treatment
of
james
instead
of
seeing
in
me
a
brother
he
saw
only
an
apprentice
indentured
to
him
until
i
was
over
whom
he
held
the
iron
rod
of
a
master
and
from
whom
he
expected
the
most
servile
obedience
at
times
i
may
have
been
saucy
and
provoking
but
it
was
when
i
was
receiving
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
bear
for
in
letting
loose
his
violent
temper
he
not
only
lashed
me
unmercifully
with
his
tongue
but
he
resorted
to
blows
and
you
ought
to
know
enough
of
the
franklins
by
this
time
to
understand
that
no
one
of
them
would
submit
to
such
oppression
then
to
cap
the
climax
father
who
had
always
sided
with
me
whenever
our
difficulties
were
laid
before
him
now
gave
his
decision
for
some
reason
in
favor
of
james
that
was
the
last
straw
on
the
camel
back
nothing
but
harsh
treatment
by
a
master
who
asserted
his
rights
under
the
law
awaited
me
to
remain
was
to
be
trod
upon
and
suffer
and
become
a
slave
instead
of
a
man
to
leave
was
impossible
unless
i
left
clandestinely
for
many
days
a
mighty
contest
was
waged
in
my
soul
between
love
of
home
and
escape
from
a
bondage
as
bad
as
negro
slavery
after
all
i
had
done
for
james
in
his
great
trouble
with
the
government
that
he
should
treat
me
his
own
brother
as
a
menial
to
be
abused
seemed
hard
indeed
under
such
a
burden
of
trial
scarcely
knowing
whither
to
look
for
a
friend
i
resolved
to
escape
and
i
do
not
now
regret
the
step
i
knew
that
i
should
be
misjudged
that
i
should
be
called
a
runaway
and
thought
to
be
on
the
road
to
ruin
but
i
am
not
i
mean
to
make
the
most
of
myself
possible
i
am
now
among
good
friends
who
kindly
second
all
my
efforts
at
and
my
business
prospects
were
never
so
good
if
industry
economy
temperance
honesty
and
perseverance
will
win
then
i
shall
win
you
may
be
sure
of
that
yours
affectionately
benjamin
captain
homes
was
a
strong
good
man
used
to
roughing
it
in
a
seafaring
life
but
when
he
read
benjamin
letter
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
his
lips
quivered
with
emotion
as
his
great
heart
went
out
in
sympathy
for
his
wife
young
brother
read
that
letter
he
said
to
governor
keith
who
was
present
and
then
i
will
tell
you
about
the
author
of
it
governor
keith
read
it
with
moistened
eyes
although
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
writer
and
his
romantic
history
a
touching
letter
he
remarked
returning
it
to
the
captain
the
author
of
it
is
my
wife
youngest
brother
only
a
boy
now
how
old
inquired
the
governor
only
seventeen
indeed
he
must
be
a
remarkable
boy
he
is
the
most
gifted
boy
ever
raised
in
boston
then
he
ran
away
from
boston
yes
his
father
family
is
a
prominent
one
in
the
city
and
the
eldest
son
is
a
printer
to
whom
this
youngest
son
was
apprenticed
i
see
now
responded
the
governor
that
explains
the
letter
and
he
is
settled
now
in
philadelphia
he
is
i
accidentally
learned
where
he
was
a
few
days
ago
and
wrote
to
him
and
this
letter
is
his
answer
let
me
tell
you
more
about
him
and
the
captain
rehearsed
his
connection
with
the
as
correspondent
and
editor
dwelling
upon
his
ability
and
power
as
an
independent
thinker
capable
of
canvassing
and
writing
upon
almost
any
public
question
remarkable
for
one
so
young
exclaimed
the
governor
after
listening
to
the
detailed
account
such
a
young
man
should
be
encouraged
in
his
business
so
i
think
responded
the
captain
his
letter
has
opened
my
eyes
and
i
see
now
that
he
had
good
reason
to
run
away
i
believe
that
he
will
make
his
mark
live
where
he
may
of
course
he
will
replied
the
governor
his
success
is
certain
only
give
him
a
chance
i
will
assist
him
to
establish
a
printing
house
of
his
own
in
philadelphia
and
he
shall
have
the
government
printing
to
do
he
is
abundantly
qualified
to
do
it
and
i
think
any
aid
of
that
sort
you
can
give
him
will
be
for
your
interest
as
well
as
his
he
is
reliable
and
will
do
his
best
the
captain
said
this
in
the
honesty
of
his
heart
having
a
strong
desire
to
see
benjamin
rise
we
have
two
printing
houses
in
philadelphia
now
but
they
are
poor
affairs
continued
the
governor
neither
proprietor
understands
his
business
and
one
of
them
is
very
ignorant
i
think
that
this
young
man
would
take
the
lead
at
once
i
think
that
i
can
secure
the
government
printing
of
delaware
for
him
interrupted
colonel
french
of
newcastle
who
had
listened
to
the
conversation
with
the
deepest
interest
captain
homes
i
will
see
your
as
soon
as
i
return
to
philadelphia
added
governor
keith
we
must
not
let
such
a
young
man
be
buried
up
in
a
printing
house
i
am
going
to
philadelphia
with
the
governor
interjected
colonel
french
and
i
will
accompany
him
to
see
the
young
man
i
thank
you
both
very
much
and
i
think
that
neither
of
you
will
ever
regret
your
decision
captain
homes
spoke
so
warmly
and
approvingly
that
both
governor
and
colonel
felt
reassured
as
they
separated
the
foregoing
discloses
two
good
traits
of
benjamin
character
which
the
reader
may
consider
with
profit
first
he
must
have
been
very
observing
he
understood
the
construction
of
a
so
well
that
he
could
put
an
old
one
into
running
order
young
as
he
was
when
its
proprietor
was
unable
to
do
it
this
is
more
remarkable
because
he
was
not
obliged
to
study
the
mechanism
of
a
in
order
to
work
it
many
persons
operate
machines
without
understanding
their
construction
at
all
but
a
class
of
minds
are
never
satisfied
until
they
understand
whatever
commands
their
attention
they
are
inquisitive
and
wish
to
know
the
philosophy
of
things
it
was
so
with
benjamin
and
this
quality
proved
a
valuable
element
of
his
success
it
was
the
secret
of
his
discoveries
and
inventions
in
his
manhood
as
we
shall
see
just
as
it
was
with
stephenson
as
soon
as
he
was
appointed
plugman
of
an
engine
at
seventeen
years
of
age
he
began
to
study
its
construction
in
his
leisure
hours
he
took
it
to
pieces
and
put
it
together
again
several
times
in
order
to
understand
it
in
the
second
place
benjamin
was
not
proud
pride
goeth
before
destruction
and
a
haughty
spirit
before
a
fall
he
never
came
under
this
condemnation
a
sight
of
him
passing
up
market
street
with
a
loaf
of
bread
under
each
arm
while
devouring
the
third
one
in
his
hand
in
apparel
that
was
less
comely
than
that
of
many
modern
tramps
is
proof
that
pride
had
no
dominion
over
him
many
boys
of
seventeen
in
such
poverty
and
apparel
would
have
avoided
a
public
street
and
even
a
quaker
meetinghouse
but
these
were
small
matters
to
benjamin
he
was
thinking
of
greater
things
employment
and
a
livelihood
he
had
a
destiny
to
work
out
and
in
working
that
he
must
do
as
he
could
and
not
as
he
would
he
cared
not
for
the
laughs
and
jeers
of
those
who
could
dress
better
and
live
more
sumptuously
than
himself
since
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
dress
as
he
did
in
order
to
make
his
ends
meet
he
might
have
followed
the
example
of
some
young
men
and
incurred
a
debt
in
order
to
cut
a
dash
but
he
believed
then
as
he
wrote
afterwards
that
lying
rides
on
debt
back
and
that
it
is
better
to
go
to
bed
supperless
than
to
rise
in
debt
or
as
he
expressed
himself
in
other
maxims
those
have
a
short
lent
who
owe
money
to
be
paid
at
easter
and
it
is
easier
to
build
two
chimneys
than
to
keep
one

fuel
xxii
going
up
higher
not
many
days
after
benjamin
replied
to
the
letter
of
captain
homes
an
unusual
scene
transpired
at
keimer
office
there
governor
keith
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
said
keimer
to
benjamin
as
they
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
that
tall
man
with
a
gentleman
walking
with
him
i
see
replied
benjamin
i
should
think
they
were
coming
here
sure
enough
they
are
crossing
the
street
they
must
be
coming
here
i
wonder
what
for
and
keimer
ran
down
stairs
to
meet
them
before
the
last
words
as
above
were
off
his
lips
he
supposed
of
course
that
they
were
coming
to
see
him
he
met
them
politely
at
the
door
for
it
was
not
every
day
that
he
had
the
privilege
of
welcoming
a
governor
to
his
printing
office
but
was
somewhat
taken
aback
when
the
governor
inquired
does
benjamin
franklin
work
here
he
does
do
you
wish
to
see
him
keimer
was
almost
bewildered
when
he
answered
what
can
the
governor
want
of
that
boy
he
thought
can
i
see
him
certainly
walk
in
they
walked
in
and
took
seats
benjamin
was
called
this
is
the
young
man
you
wanted
to
see
said
keimer
introducing
him
governor
keith
benjamin
i
am
very
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
responded
the
governor
i
met
your
captain
homes
at
newcastle
the
other
day
and
i
promised
to
call
and
see
you
and
this
is
colonel
french
of
newcastle
who
also
promised
captain
homes
to
call
with
me
introducing
the
colonel
benjamin
was
too
much
astonished
to
feel
at
ease
he
would
not
have
been
so
amazed
if
an
officer
from
boston
had
called
to
arrest
him
as
a
runaway
what
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
could
want
of
him
was
beyond
his
wildest
dreams
if
keimer
can
spare
you
a
short
time
we
would
like
you
to
go
with
us
for
an
interview
as
we
promised
captain
homes
added
the
governor
i
am
at
your
service
benjamin
replied
collecting
his
scattered
and
wondering
thoughts
keimer
can
spare
me
no
doubt
within
a
few
minutes
he
was
with
the
governor
and
colonel
french
at
a
tavern
on
the
corner
of
third
street
in
a
room
by
themselves
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
a
young
man
of
your
abilities
remarked
the
governor
and
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
setting
up
the
printing
business
for
yourself
in
this
town
captain
homes
told
me
of
your
experience
and
ability
on
this
and
other
lines
and
i
am
sure
that
you
can
start
a
printing
house
of
your
own
and
make
a
success
of
it
but
i
have
nothing
to
start
such
a
business
with
it
requires
capital
true
very
true
but
i
think
we
can
arrange
that
perhaps
your
father
could
give
you
a
start
judging
from
what
captain
homes
says
i
suppose
that
he
might
if
he
was
so
disposed
but
i
doubt
whether
he
would
do
it
benjamin
was
querying
as
he
spoke
whether
captain
homes
had
disclosed
the
fact
of
his
being
a
runaway
i
can
write
a
letter
to
him
setting
before
him
the
excellent
opportunity
for
a
printer
here
who
understands
the
business
as
you
do
and
advise
him
to
render
you
aid
the
governor
did
not
hint
that
he
knew
about
his
leaving
home
clandestinely
that
is
very
kind
on
your
part
but
is
it
not
true
that
two
printing
houses
are
as
many
as
this
town
can
support
well
it
would
be
if
they
were
but
they
are
not
the
proprietors
do
not
understand
their
business
they
have
poor
equipments
too
and
their
outfit
does
not
enable
them
to
do
work
the
governor
will
see
that
you
have
the
government
printing
of
pennsylvania
to
do
suggested
colonel
french
and
i
have
no
question
that
i
can
secure
the
government
printing
of
delaware
for
you
also
this
will
give
you
patronage
as
well
as
business
i
thank
you
both
very
much
for
your
kindness
and
confidence
and
i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
have
a
printing
house
of
my
own
how
would
this
plan
do
continued
the
governor
you
return
to
boston
by
the
first
vessel
that
goes
taking
a
letter
from
me
to
your
father
in
which
i
will
lay
the
whole
matter
before
him
so
that
he
can
understand
it
recommending
that
he
set
you
up
in
business
here
well
replied
benjamin
after
some
hesitation
the
plan
is
good
enough
but
i
fear
it
will
not
work
it
will
do
no
hurt
to
try
it
retorted
the
governor
and
you
will
have
an
opportunity
to
see
your
friends
and
they
will
have
an
opportunity
to
see
you
yes
and
i
shall
enjoy
that
but
i
could
not
honorably
leave
keimer
at
present
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
leave
him
at
present
it
may
be
three
months
before
a
vessel
is
billed
for
boston
you
can
work
for
him
at
present
notifying
him
that
you
shall
return
to
boston
on
a
visit
by
the
first
vessel
that
goes
yes
i
can
do
that
said
benjamin
you
will
not
of
course
divulge
your
plan
of
establishing
a
printing
house
of
your
own
suggested
the
governor
keep
that
a
secret
your
plan
may
not
work
so
that
it
will
be
wise
to
keep
it
a
secret
for
the
present
well
i
will
defer
to
your
judgment
and
return
to
boston
by
the
first
vessel
that
sails
if
the
plan
works
and
benjamin
franklin
should
run
a
successful
business
house
in
this
town
the
credit
of
it
will
belong
to
you
they
separated
with
the
understanding
that
benjamin
would
return
to
boston
by
the
first
vessel
sailing
for
that
port
the
governor
and
his
friend
retired
and
benjamin
returned
to
his
work
at
the
printing
office
the
reader
will
make
special
note
of
this
unusual
scene
here
was
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
and
a
leading
public
man
of
delaware
in
conference
with
a
boy
of
seventeen
years
about
establishing
a
printing
house
of
his
own
in
philadelphia
with
the
promise
of
the
government
patronage
what
sort
of
a
boy
must
he
be
not
one
of
common
mould
or
capacity
but
one
as
the
sequel
will
show
who
shall
rule
in
the
councils
of
the
nation
keimer
curiosity
was
on
tiptoe
he
wanted
to
know
what
business
governor
keith
could
have
with
his
young
employe
why
replied
benjamin
he
met
my
who
is
captain
of
a
sloop
at
newcastle
and
learned
of
him
that
i
was
working
in
this
town
and
so
he
called
all
that
may
be
but
governors
are
not
in
the
habit
of
calling
upon
boys
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
and
keimer
looked
very
unbelieving
when
he
said
it
he
told
my
that
he
should
call
and
my
urged
him
to
do
so
colonel
french
was
a
personal
friend
who
came
with
him
and
he
too
promised
captain
homes
that
he
would
call
that
is
all
right
but
you
are
the
first
boy
that
ever
lived
in
philadelphia
who
has
attracted
the
governor
patronage
to
himself
keimer
was
somewhat
jocose
while
at
the
same
time
he
was
evidently
suspicious
that
benjamin
was
withholding
the
real
object
of
the
governor
visit
my
had
written
to
me
to
take
the
first
opportunity
i
could
to
make
a
trip
to
boston
to
see
my
friends
continued
benjamin
and
he
talked
with
the
governor
about
it
the
governor
thinks
as
he
does
going
not
at
present
if
i
go
i
must
go
by
sea
and
not
by
land
afford
to
go
by
land
and
i
am
told
that
vessels
do
not
often
sail
from
here
to
boston
i
shall
have
to
wait
to
get
more
money
than
i
have
now
before
i
go
perhaps
the
governor
will
charter
a
vessel
to
take
you
there
if
you
ask
him
suggested
keimer
who
was
evidently
chagrined
that
the
governor
called
to
see
his
employe
instead
of
himself
perhaps
i
shall
ask
him
when
i
become
more
familiar
with
him
benjamin
replied
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
when
i
get
to
be
a
member
of
his
staff
i
may
be
cheeky
enough
to
suggest
it
keimer
found
that
he
could
not
make
out
much
by
quizzing
his
young
printer
so
he
dropped
it
and
dismissed
the
subject
for
the
time
being
benjamin
thoughts
were
all
the
while
concentrated
on
this
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
it
would
not
be
strange
if
such
interest
in
his
welfare
by
the
highest
officer
in
the
state
appealed
to
his
vanity
somewhat
although
keimer
could
discover
nothing
of
the
kind
the
latter
gentleman
however
concluded
that
he
had
a
mysterious
character
in
his
employ
and
he
was
greatly
puzzled
to
know
just
what
he
was
he
might
be
the
son
of
some
great
man
for
whose
sake
the
governor
interested
himself
in
his
welfare
possibly
he
might
have
left
boston
in
some
trouble
and
his
influential
friends
together
with
captain
homes
induced
the
governor
to
look
after
him
many
theories
by
way
of
explanation
occupied
his
thoughts
at
any
rate
he
was
an
enigma
to
his
employer
who
was
becoming
more
and
more
interested
in
him
the
governor
visit
served
to
magnify
his
abilities
and
worth
in
keimer
view
he
thought
more
of
him
than
he
did
before
he
discovered
more
talent
and
efficiency
in
him
but
he
could
get
little
satisfaction
out
of
him
once
in
a
while
he
would
indulge
in
a
spasm
of
quizzing
and
then
he
would
subside
into
silent
musing
over
the
curious
boy
who
was
setting
type
for
him
benjamin
continued
to
work
early
and
late
interesting
himself
in
keimer
business
as
if
it
were
his
own
thereby
becoming
an
indispensable
assistant
to
him
but
he
embraced
the
first
opportunity
to
write
to
his
boon
companion
in
boston
john
collins
and
disclose
the
unexpected
change
in
his
affairs
as
follows
dear
john
you
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
i
expect
to
make
a
visit
to
boston
by
the
first
vessel
that
sails
for
that
port
it
may
be
three
or
four
months
before
one
sails
but
look
for
me
on
board
i
will
tell
you
how
this
new
order
of
things
was
brought
about
my
capt
robert
homes
was
at
newcastle
delaware
and
found
out
in
some
way
that
i
was
living
in
philadelphia
and
he
wrote
to
me
i
replied
to
his
letter
and
he
showed
it
to
governor
keith
of
pennsylvania
who
lives
in
this
town
and
told
him
about
me
and
interested
him
in
my
welfare
so
the
governor
came
to
see
me
and
urged
me
to
establish
a
printing
house
of
my
own
here
promising
me
the
state
printing
and
offering
to
write
a
letter
to
my
father
that
i
shall
take
with
me
when
i
go
to
boston
in
which
he
will
set
forth
the
prospects
of
my
success
and
urge
him
to
furnish
me
with
money
to
start
this
is
the
substance
of
the
story
the
details
of
which
i
will
rehearse
when
i
see
you
in
the
mean
time
continue
to
keep
the
secret
i
suppose
that
captain
homes
will
disclose
the
place
of
my
residence
so
that
it
will
be
a
mystery
to
them
no
longer
but
do
not
let
any
thing
get
abroad
from
you
when
we
meet
i
shall
have
much
to
tell
you
until
then
your
old
friend
b
franklin
governor
keith
sent
for
benjamin
to
dine
with
him
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
a
little
more
about
your
visit
to
boston
he
remarked
at
the
how
long
will
you
be
gone
that
will
depend
upon
the
voyage
there
and
back
will
occupy
from
three
to
four
weeks
on
the
vessel
i
do
not
care
about
spending
over
a
week
in
boston
i
shall
want
to
get
back
as
soon
as
i
can
to
start
in
business
does
keimer
suspect
that
any
thing
in
particular
is
on
the
tapis
i
did
not
know
but
my
visit
might
awaken
his
curiosity
to
learn
what
it
was
for
it
did
and
he
plied
me
with
questions
in
order
to
find
out
for
some
time
once
in
a
while
now
he
is
very
inquisitive
evidently
thinking
that
i
am
withholding
something
from
him
he
is
quite
an
intelligent
man
without
any
surplus
of
honesty
so
i
understand
bradford
is
very
ignorant
but
honest
while
keimer
is
bright
and
but
unscrupulous
that
is
about
as
near
the
truth
as
one
can
get
continued
benjamin
i
have
a
pleasant
time
with
keimer
however
and
have
nothing
to
complain
of
on
that
line
can
you
give
me
any
idea
of
the
time
it
will
take
after
you
return
to
get
a
printing
house
in
running
order
not
exactly
if
my
plans
succeed
and
i
bring
back
a
and
materials
with
me
i
think
a
month
will
be
ample
time
to
put
the
whole
thing
in
running
order
the
enterprise
was
canvassed
at
the
table
the
governor
conversing
with
his
young
guest
in
the
most
familiar
manner
dropping
many
complimentary
words
whenever
he
wanted
to
see
him
thereafter
he
invited
him
to
dine
which
was
quite
often
all
of
which
benjamin
enjoyed
very
much
in
his
old
age
referring
to
these
interviews
with
governor
keith
franklin
said
the
governor
sent
for
me
now
and
then
to
dine
with
him
which
i
considered
a
great
honor
more
particularly
as
he
conversed
with
me
in
the
most
affable
familiar
and
friendly
manner
a
novelist
would
portray
the
advantages
of
running
away
from
home
when
representing
benjamin
the
runaway
at
the
governor
table
if
he
had
remained
in
boston
attacking
the
officials
of
the
english
government
with
his
pen
the
governor
might
have
put
him
in
prison
as
he
did
his
brother
but
benjamin
never
justified
the
use
he
made
of
his
legs
at
that
time
that
is
he
never
excused
it
in
his
years
of
maturity
he
always
spoke
of
it
regretfully
very
few
runaways
possess
as
much
talent
and
character
as
he
did
and
few
ever
had
so
much
cause
for
running
away
and
here
is
found
the
only
reason
that
the
act
was
overruled
to
his
advantage
at
length
a
small
vessel
was
announced
to
sail
for
boston
i
am
ready
to
go
in
her
he
said
to
governor
keith
she
sails
in
about
a
week
i
am
very
glad
answered
the
governor
you
have
waited
long
enough
for
it
i
will
have
my
letter
to
your
father
ready
in
time
and
i
hope
your
mission
will
be
successful
is
there
any
thing
more
i
can
do
for
you
nothing
i
have
been
getting
myself
in
readiness
all
along
so
that
i
have
little
to
do
now
as
the
time
draws
near
i
am
very
anxious
to
go
my
father
and
mother
will
be
very
happy
in
looking
into
my
face
again
and
i
think
you
will
be
as
happy
in
looking
into
their
faces
again
responded
the
governor
captain
homes
spoke
in
the
highest
terms
of
your
parents
and
of
your
standing
in
boston
benjamin
wondered
more
than
ever
whether
his
brother
homes
disclosed
the
fact
of
his
leaving
home
clandestinely
to
the
governor
no
words
were
dropped
to
indicate
that
he
did
but
governor
keith
was
a
wise
man
and
thought
it
was
not
best
to
divulge
his
acquaintance
with
that
part
of
the
affair
benjamin
improved
the
first
opportunity
to
announce
his
departure
to
keimer
going
to
see
my
parents
he
said
a
vessel
sails
for
boston
in
about
a
week
you
have
not
been
away
from
home
long
yet
i
should
think
that
you
might
wait
a
year
at
least
no
i
ca
wait
longer
though
i
do
not
intend
to
stay
long
i
am
attached
to
philadelphia
and
i
shall
want
to
return
as
soon
as
i
can
after
letting
my
father
and
mother
look
me
over
a
few
days
has
the
governor
of
the
massachusetts
province
sent
for
you
keimer
asked
jocosely
the
fact
was
he
could
not
get
over
governor
interest
in
benjamin
because
he
could
not
yet
understand
it
as
the
weeks
rolled
on
his
employee
grew
to
be
more
and
more
an
object
of
curiosity
no
nor
any
body
else
answered
benjamin
i
shall
take
the
governor
by
surprise
so
that
he
will
have
no
time
to
get
up
a
reception
i
prefer
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
to
the
governor
of
massachusetts
if
keimer
had
known
all
the
circumstances
he
might
have
replied
you
have
reason
to
feel
so
for
the
governor
of
massachusetts
would
rather
see
you
in
prison
than
running
a
printing
house
benjamin
purchased
a
nice
suit
of
clothes
also
a
watch
before
starting
on
his
trip
and
then
had
quite
a
sum
of
pocket
money
to
take
with
him
he
bade
keimer
took
leave
of
the
governor
with
many
thanks
for
his
kindness
receiving
from
him
a
long
complimentary
letter
to
his
father
nor
did
he
forget
to
call
upon
the
bradford
family
to
make
known
his
purpose
and
thank
them
again
for
their
hospitality
and
of
course
read
and
family
received
a
good
share
of
his
thankfulness
especially
the
daughter
in
whom
benjamin
had
become
quite
interested
once
on
board
the
vessel
under
way
benjamin
began
to
reflect
upon
his
novel
experiences
it
appeared
to
him
somewhat
like
a
dream
he
could
hardly
realize
that
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
his
home
by
the
governor
patronage
he
took
out
the
governor
letter
to
his
father
and
read
it
he
found
that
it
was
very
complimentary
to
himself
fully
as
much
so
as
he
had
expected
and
the
prospects
of
a
new
printing
house
under
his
care
were
set
forth
strongly
he
had
scarcely
finished
reading
the
letter
when
the
vessel
struck
on
a
shoal
for
they
were
not
out
of
the
bay
yet
she
sprung
a
leak
and
there
was
considerable
excitement
on
board
before
the
crew
could
remedy
the
accident
a
hard
storm
is
near
by
said
the
captain
you
will
have
a
rough
passage
this
time
young
man
addressing
benjamin
well
i
am
used
to
it
i
have
encountered
as
many
storms
as
any
body
of
my
age
replied
benjamin
figuratively
which
the
captain
did
not
quite
understand
then
you
have
followed
the
sea
have
you
no
i
have
followed
the
land
mostly
but
there
are
hard
storms
on
the
land
are
there
not
of
course
and
the
captain
thought
only
of
rain
storms
and
snow
storms
when
he
answered
all
i
meant
was
added
benjamin
by
way
of
explanation
that
i
have
had
rather
of
a
rough
life
so
far
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
trouble
for
one
of
my
years
and
have
rather
got
accustomed
to
rough
usage
a
storm
at
sea
will
only
vary
the
experience
a
little
i
think
i
can
withstand
it
you
will
have
to
stand
it
any
way
not
much
chance
to
choose
when
a
storm
overtakes
us
out
to
sea
if
i
am
any
judge
of
weather
a
terrible
storm
is
brewing
and
it
will
be
on
us
in
a
hurry
well
i
like
the
water
i
meant
to
have
become
a
sailor
once
but
my
father
put
his
veto
on
it
if
i
had
been
allowed
my
own
way
i
should
have
been
serving
before
the
mast
now
benjamin
never
spoke
truer
words
than
these
hard
life
responded
the
captain
if
i
could
live
my
life
over
again
i
should
chose
any
thing
on
land
rather
than
the
best
on
the
sea
i
would
not
command
a
vessel
another
day
if
there
was
any
thing
else
i
could
do
but
this
is
all
i
know
they
had
scarcely
emerged
from
the
bay
when
the
storm
burst
upon
them
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
long
violent
tempestuous
spell
of
weather
such
as
mariners
encounter
on
the
sea
a
new
and
exciting
experience
to
benjamin
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
storms
at
sea
and
and
you
will
one
now
interrupted
the
captain
what
you
have
about
it
gives
you
a
poor
idea
of
the
reality
compared
with
it
i
confess
to
a
kind
of
desire
to
see
a
real
hard
one
answered
benjamin
coolly
if
i
should
be
frightened
half
out
of
my
wits
i
shall
be
as
well
off
as
the
rest
of
you
the
vessel
is
leaking
badly
cried
out
one
of
the
crew
man
the
pumps
replied
the
captain
enough
for
all
hands
to
do
now
including
me
responded
benjamin
i
can
do
as
much
as
any
of
you
at
the
pump
and
he
went
to
work
with
the
crew
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
storm
continued
for
days
tossing
their
small
craft
about
like
a
shell
keeping
all
hands
busy
night
and
day
sometimes
the
sea
threatening
to
swallow
the
vessel
and
all
it
contained
in
its
hungry
maw
the
vessel
was
two
weeks
on
its
way
to
boston
encountering
stormy
weather
nearly
the
whole
time
most
of
the
voyage
the
leaky
craft
was
kept
from
sinking
by
pumping
in
which
benjamin
took
his
turn
proving
himself
as
efficient
as
any
one
of
the
crew
and
he
was
as
cool
and
as
any
one
of
the
number
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
they
sailed
into
boston
harbor
and
benjamin
was
at
home
xxiii
the
surprise
and
its
results
benjamin
hastened
to
the
corner
of
hanover
and
union
streets
where
the
sign
of
the
familiar
blue
ball
hung
and
entered
with
a
fluttering
heart
benjamin
exclaimed
his
father
can
that
be
you
and
he
grasped
one
of
his
hands
in
both
of
his
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
no
more
glad
than
i
am
to
see
you
responded
the
son
shaking
his
father
hand
heartily
i
am
glad
to
get
home
the
words
were
scarcely
off
his
tongue
when
his
mother
appeared
upon
the
scene
mother
o
benjamin
and
his
mother
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
weeping
tears
of
joy
benjamin
wept
too
he
began
to
realize
what
months
of
agony
his
absence
had
caused
the
woman
who
bore
him
can
it
be
you
my
son
i
have
mourned
for
you
as
dead
she
said
as
soon
as
she
could
command
her
feelings
where
have
you
been
in
philadelphia
has
not
captain
homes
told
you
where
i
was
not
a
word
from
him
about
it
he
wrote
to
me
from
newcastle
three
months
ago
and
i
replied
to
his
letter
i
supposed
that
you
had
heard
all
about
it
before
this
time
we
have
not
heard
the
least
thing
from
you
since
you
left
said
his
father
and
they
have
been
seven
very
long
and
painful
months
how
painful
benjamin
you
can
never
know
added
his
mother
sometimes
it
has
seemed
as
if
my
old
heart
would
break
with
grief
but
i
have
tried
to
cast
my
burden
on
the
lord
if
you
had
staid
at
home
and
died
my
sorrow
could
not
have
been
so
great
let
it
end
now
replied
benjamin
with
a
smile
for
i
am
here
again
yes
i
thank
my
god
for
my
son
was
dead
and
is
alive
again
he
was
lost
and
is
found
and
his
mother
came
almost
as
near
to
death
with
joy
as
she
had
been
before
with
sorrow
they
sat
down
together
when
benjamin
rehearsed
his
experience
since
leaving
boston
not
omitting
to
state
the
cause
of
his
sudden
departure
and
the
reason
of
his
return
and
then
he
put
the
letter
of
governor
keith
into
his
father
hand
how
is
james
i
suppose
he
is
at
the
printing
office
i
must
go
to
see
him
benjamin
words
and
tone
of
speech
indicated
only
good
will
towards
his
brother
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
benjamin
it
has
grieved
me
terribly
that
he
should
treat
you
so
unbrotherly
i
do
hope
that
you
will
now
be
reconciled
to
each
other
his
mother
spoke
with
much
feeling
i
trust
we
shall
i
am
ready
to
forgive
and
forget
i
have
learned
a
good
lesson
from
experience
since
leaving
boston
so
saying
he
started
for
the
printing
office
not
knowing
what
sort
of
a
reception
awaited
him
there
he
hoped
for
the
best
however
james
he
extended
his
hand
as
he
spoke
james
would
not
have
been
more
astonished
over
one
who
rose
from
the
dead
but
he
took
his
hand
in
a
cold
reserved
sort
of
a
way
merely
saying
benjamin
after
surveying
him
from
head
to
foot
a
few
moments
he
turned
back
to
his
work
again
without
another
word
the
act
pierced
heart
it
was
so
unkind
and
cruel
but
soon
he
rose
above
the
situation
and
seemed
to
say
by
actions
i
can
stand
it
if
you
can
the
journeymen
were
delighted
to
see
him
leaving
their
work
they
pressed
around
him
with
a
whole
catechism
of
questions
where
have
you
been
ben
in
philadelphia
what
kind
of
a
place
is
it
it
is
a
fine
place
i
like
it
better
than
boston
going
back
yes
very
soon
too
no
place
like
that
for
the
printing
business
good
pay
yes
better
pay
than
in
boston
how
large
is
the
place
seven
thousand
inhabitants
smaller
than
boston
but
smarter
what
kind
of
money
do
you
have
there
there
was
no
established
currency
in
the
country
at
that
time
and
paper
money
only
was
used
in
boston
his
interrogator
wanted
to
know
what
they
used
in
philadelphia
they
use
that
replied
benjamin
taking
from
his
pocket
nearly
five
pounds
sterling
in
silver
and
laying
it
on
the
table
rather
heavier
stuff
to
carry
than
your
boston
paper
money
it
looks
as
if
you
had
struck
a
silver
mine
ben
remarked
one
some
lucky
hit
ben
said
another
the
printing
business
bring
you
that
no
other
did
i
was
a
printer
when
i
left
and
i
am
now
and
i
expect
to
be
in
the
future
and
what
is
more
i
have
no
desire
for
another
business
you
sport
a
watch
i
see
said
one
of
the
number
yes
such
as
it
is
a
good
companion
though
let
us
see
it
one
suggested
you
can
and
benjamin
passed
it
to
him
and
all
examined
it
ca
afford
such
luxuries
in
boston
one
printer
remarked
it
is
not
a
luxury
by
any
means
it
is
a
necessity
replied
benjamin
i
should
not
know
how
to
get
along
without
a
watch
now
well
ben
you
can
afford
to
have
a
watch
added
one
for
you
can
live
on
bread
and
water
and
never
want
a
day
of
pleasure
and
never
drink
liquors
and
he
can
afford
to
treat
us
all
since
he
has
fared
so
well
suggested
one
of
the
men
i
always
did
treat
you
well
and
always
intend
to
was
answer
as
if
he
did
not
understand
that
treating
with
intoxicating
liquors
was
meant
that
is
so
ben
but
now
just
treat
us
with
something
stronger
than
water
for
old
acquaintance
sake
at
that
time
the
use
of
intoxicating
liquors
was
almost
universal
benjamin
did
not
use
them
and
once
in
a
while
was
found
a
person
who
did
not
most
people
were
habitual
drinkers
and
there
was
little
or
no
opposition
to
the
custom
and
the
habit
of
treating
was
general
there
is
a
dollar
replied
benjamin
throwing
out
a
dollar
in
silver
take
that
and
drink
what
you
want
for
old
sake
replacing
his
watch
and
money
he
left
the
office
with
the
promise
to
come
around
again
while
this
interview
with
the
men
was
going
on
james
would
occasionally
look
up
from
his
work
grim
and
sullen
as
benjamin
said
evidently
as
unreconciled
to
his
brother
as
ever
the
next
day
james
said
to
his
father
and
mother
at
their
house
it
was
an
insult
he
meant
to
insult
me
when
he
came
to
the
office
no
james
replied
his
mother
benjamin
meant
no
such
thing
he
told
us
that
he
was
ready
to
forgive
and
forget
he
has
a
poor
way
of
showing
it
then
retorted
james
who
was
too
revengeful
to
be
reasonable
well
you
are
brothers
interrupted
his
father
and
you
should
act
as
brothers
toward
each
other
it
has
a
bad
look
for
one
brother
to
be
resentful
toward
another
and
it
not
only
has
the
added
his
mother
but
it
is
a
most
wicked
state
of
heart
to
cherish
you
will
never
prosper
james
so
long
as
you
treat
your
brother
so
and
you
never
ought
to
prosper
franklin
spoke
with
great
plainness
she
had
never
justified
james
at
all
in
his
treatment
of
benjamin
and
now
that
the
former
was
adding
injury
to
injury
by
falsely
accusing
the
latter
she
could
not
suppress
her
feelings
she
magnified
the
severity
of
her
words
by
quoting
whosoever
is
angry
with
his
brother
without
a
cause
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
judgment
my
advice
to
you
james
is
to
let
the
dead
past
bury
the
dead
it
will
do
no
good
to
revive
old
memories
make
the
future
as
bright
as
you
can
that
is
the
only
wise
course
i
am
quite
sure
that
benjamin
will
meet
you
more
than
half
way
in
erasing
old
scores
franklin
spoke
this
with
much
feeling
as
he
turned
away
to
his
work
james
continued
to
be
resentful
and
failed
to
reduce
his
father
counsel
to
practice
benjamin
soon
found
his
old
friend
john
collins
and
there
was
mutual
satisfaction
in
their
meeting
as
soon
however
as
the
first
pleasure
of
meeting
was
over
benjamin
discovered
that
his
friend
had
become
intemperate
and
he
was
both
surprised
and
grieved
however
he
gratified
john
with
a
detailed
account
of
his
experience
from
the
time
they
separated
not
omitting
a
glowing
description
of
his
prospects
in
philadelphia
how
soon
will
you
return
john
inquired
i
want
to
leave
here
within
two
weeks
if
i
can
i
ought
not
to
stay
but
a
week
how
will
it
do
for
me
to
return
with
you
i
think
it
will
do
well
if
you
stick
closely
to
business
that
is
the
only
way
we
can
succeed
in
any
thing
i
can
do
that
work
never
hurt
me
or
any
thing
else
john
did
not
take
the
hint
in
benjamin
last
remark
but
strong
drink
has
hurt
a
great
many
i
should
never
expect
to
succeed
in
any
thing
if
i
used
it
as
many
do
nor
i
answered
john
who
was
blind
to
his
own
danger
as
all
intemperate
men
are
we
have
no
need
of
any
such
beverage
at
all
continued
benjamin
i
discard
it
entirely
now
as
you
know
that
i
did
when
i
lived
here
in
boston
water
is
the
best
beverage
for
us
both
you
may
be
right
ben
you
are
generally
but
are
you
not
a
little
odd
in
discarding
what
nearly
every
one
uses
john
was
trying
to
find
an
excuse
for
himself
better
be
odd
than
to
be
disqualified
for
business
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
rum
disqualifies
more
men
for
business
than
all
other
evils
put
together
once
you
were
of
my
opinion
john
but
your
habits
have
been
changing
your
opinion
well
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
replied
john
who
found
that
benjamin
was
becoming
rather
personal
what
do
you
think
of
my
going
to
philadelphia
with
you
if
your
habits
now
are
what
your
personal
appearance
indicates
you
will
not
succeed
in
philadelphia
any
better
than
you
can
in
boston
an
intemperate
man
is
a
failure
anywhere
then
you
do
think
i
am
good
enough
to
go
back
with
you
said
john
with
a
degree
of
warmth
i
did
not
say
so
john
to
tell
you
the
plain
truth
i
am
shocked
at
the
change
drink
has
wrought
in
your
appearance
you
are
fast
becoming
a
wreck
i
should
say
and
i
do
want
a
wreck
of
a
friend
on
my
hands
then
you
do
want
i
should
go
with
you
not
if
you
continue
to
drink
as
you
do
now
sober
john
collins
i
should
delight
to
have
accompany
me
especially
if
he
looks
upon
strong
drink
as
the
enemy
of
mankind
i
am
your
friend
now
as
much
as
ever
but
i
am
disappointed
and
even
shocked
by
your
appearance
you
are
fast
becoming
a
wreck
you
are
complimentary
ben
i
must
confess
but
i
ca
say
that
you
are
wrong
you
have
been
about
right
so
far
in
life
perhaps
your
views
are
correct
about
drink
i
do
ask
you
to
accept
my
views
but
i
entreat
you
to
let
strong
drink
alone
for
your
own
sake
and
my
sake
too
if
you
can
give
a
wide
berth
to
all
sorts
of
intoxicating
liquors
as
i
do
i
should
be
delighted
to
have
you
return
to
philadelphia
with
me
that
is
become
a
you
mean
ben
i
did
not
say
so
become
a
reasonable
being
and
not
indulge
to
excess
i
do
not
ask
any
body
to
live
exactly
as
i
do
though
i
believe
that
every
person
who
discards
liquors
will
be
better
off
at
that
day
when
the
temperance
cause
was
not
born
and
the
use
of
intoxicants
was
universal
it
was
generally
believed
that
moderate
drinking
could
be
followed
without
leading
to
excessive
drinking
it
is
plain
that
benjamin
had
that
idea
for
himself
he
practised
entire
abstinence
from
intoxicants
because
he
thought
it
was
better
for
him
another
person
might
drink
moderately
in
his
view
and
be
just
as
well
off
but
intemperance
he
abhorred
and
he
thought
that
every
body
else
ought
to
abhor
it
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
ben
continued
john
there
is
some
sense
in
what
you
say
you
did
not
leave
it
all
in
philadelphia
when
you
came
away
that
is
sure
i
want
to
go
back
with
you
badly
and
i
will
think
it
over
that
is
it
john
sober
john
collins
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
i
shall
enjoy
his
society
in
philadelphia
or
any
other
part
of
the
world
think
it
over
and
i
will
see
you
again
franklin
read
the
letter
of
governor
keith
over
and
over
it
was
a
good
letter
to
cheer
a
father
heart
if
it
was
genuine
evidently
he
had
some
doubts
whether
the
affair
was
all
right
while
he
was
querying
about
the
genuineness
of
the
letter
from
governor
keith
captain
homes
arrived
in
boston
and
first
of
all
called
upon
his
father
franklin
benjamin
is
here
said
franklin
and
according
to
his
story
he
has
a
good
prospect
before
him
in
philadelphia
and
here
is
a
letter
from
sir
william
keith
governor
of
pennsylvania
that
he
brought
with
him
and
he
passed
the
letter
to
the
captain
i
met
governor
keith
at
newcastle
and
showed
him
a
letter
i
received
from
benjamin
replied
captain
homes
which
satisfied
me
that
he
had
more
reason
than
i
had
supposed
for
running
away
i
interested
the
governor
in
his
welfare
on
his
return
to
philadelphia
after
having
met
benjamin
he
wrote
to
me
how
much
pleased
he
was
with
him
and
what
he
had
proposed
captain
homes
read
the
governor
letter
through
and
remarked
that
is
substantially
what
he
wrote
to
me
and
it
appears
to
me
that
there
is
a
good
opening
for
him
in
philadelphia
you
think
that
sir
william
keith
is
reliable
do
you
he
ought
to
be
i
ca
think
of
any
reason
why
a
man
in
his
position
should
be
saying
and
doing
what
he
do
mean
nor
i
and
yet
it
seems
almost
strange
that
he
should
favor
a
boy
of
eighteen
engaging
in
such
an
enterprise
without
money
and
without
experience
you
are
wrong
father
answered
the
captain
very
few
young
men
years
of
age
have
had
the
experience
he
has
had
he
has
occupied
positions
and
met
emergencies
every
time
with
the
promptness
and
ability
of
one
ten
years
older
that
may
be
so
i
think
it
is
so
and
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
that
sir
william
keith
can
write
as
he
does
about
him
but
it
ca
be
expected
that
a
boy
of
eighteen
can
have
the
judgment
and
wisdom
to
conduct
business
for
himself
as
he
will
at
i
think
it
can
be
expected
and
should
be
expected
if
these
qualities
are
as
fully
developed
at
eighteen
as
they
are
in
other
young
men
at
the
captain
was
emphatic
in
his
endorsement
of
benjamin
this
conversation
was
interrupted
by
benjamin
appearance
he
was
delighted
to
meet
captain
homes
and
this
gentleman
was
delighted
to
meet
him
the
satisfaction
was
mutual
one
of
the
first
questions
that
benjamin
asked
was
how
did
you
learn
that
i
was
living
in
philadelphia
from
a
citizen
of
that
town
of
whom
i
was
inquiring
about
the
business
of
the
place
incidentally
he
spoke
of
a
young
printer
from
boston
who
had
come
there
i
met
him
in
newcastle
he
even
knew
your
name
will
out
is
an
old
maxim
that
finds
confirmation
in
my
case
responded
benjamin
but
it
is
all
for
the
best
i
think
i
am
glad
that
the
way
was
opened
for
me
to
return
to
boston
i
have
just
read
governor
keith
letter
to
your
father
and
i
hope
that
he
will
be
able
to
give
you
a
start
in
philadelphia
the
captain
said
this
in
the
presence
of
franklin
while
franklin
was
considering
the
proposition
contained
in
governor
keith
letter
benjamin
was
busy
in
calling
upon
old
friends
and
visiting
old
resorts
he
had
been
absent
seven
months
and
in
that
time
had
added
two
or
three
times
that
number
of
months
to
his
personal
appearance
he
appeared
like
a
young
man
years
of
age
and
his
new
apparel
imparted
to
him
a
grace
and
comeliness
that
he
lacked
when
he
left
boston
he
had
developed
into
a
handsome
gentlemanly
intelligent
and
witty
young
man
it
was
during
this
visit
to
boston
that
he
called
upon
increase
mather
to
whose
preaching
he
listened
when
a
resident
of
the
town
the
doctor
received
him
cordially
and
invited
him
into
his
library
where
they
chatted
for
some
time
about
books
philadelphia
and
other
matters
when
benjamin
arose
to
go
the
doctor
said
come
this
way
and
i
will
show
you
a
nearer
way
out
pointing
to
a
narrow
passage
with
a
beam
crossing
it
overhead
they
were
still
talking
the
doctor
following
behind
benjamin
when
the
latter
turned
partly
about
to
speak
to
the
former
shouted
the
doctor
benjamin
did
not
understand
what
he
meant
until
his
head
struck
the
beam
overhead
with
considerable
force
there
said
the
doctor
laughing
you
are
young
and
have
the
world
before
you
stoop
as
you
go
through
it
and
you
may
miss
many
hard
thumps
nearly
seventy
years
afterwards
the
recipient
of
this
counsel
wrote
as
follows
this
advice
thus
beaten
into
my
head
has
frequently
been
of
use
to
me
and
i
often
think
of
it
when
i
see
pride
mortified
and
misfortunes
brought
upon
people
by
carrying
their
heads
too
high
john
collins
was
a
clerk
in
the
he
revolved
the
matter
of
going
to
philadelphia
with
benjamin
a
sober
youth
or
remaining
in
boston
a
drunken
one
the
more
he
pondered
the
more
he
was
inclined
to
accept
benjamin
advice
the
appeal
from
collins
drunk
to
collins
sober
finally
met
his
approval
i
have
decided
to
go
with
you
he
said
to
benjamin
the
next
time
they
met
glad
to
hear
it
john
if
you
take
my
advice
and
leave
the
in
boston
i
shall
enjoy
your
company
hugely
you
shall
have
it
i
have
given
up
my
position
in
the
and
am
packing
up
now
i
want
to
carry
my
books
with
the
rest
of
my
traps
and
i
shall
take
my
books
this
time
i
shall
ship
to
new
york
where
i
have
some
business
and
thence
to
philadelphia
and
i
want
to
go
by
the
way
of
providence
rhode
island
to
visit
friends
and
will
meet
you
in
new
york
responded
john
agreed
but
remember
john
that
you
and
i
are
going
to
steer
clear
of
strong
drink
give
it
a
wide
berth
and
the
way
is
open
before
you
to
success
i
see
it
and
mean
to
act
accordingly
john
really
meant
what
he
said
but
the
poor
fellow
did
not
understand
how
weak
he
was
neither
was
benjamin
aware
that
the
drink
habit
was
fastened
upon
him
so
tightly
franklin
had
taken
a
plenty
of
time
to
consider
the
advice
of
governor
keith
and
benjamin
was
getting
uneasy
to
return
i
have
considered
the
matter
long
and
carefully
said
franklin
to
benjamin
having
a
desire
to
aid
you
if
possible
but
have
come
to
the
conclusion
finally
that
i
can
not
do
it
at
present
i
told
governor
keith
that
i
doubted
whether
you
would
assist
me
now
so
that
your
conclusion
is
not
altogether
unexpected
reply
was
cool
almost
indifferent
when
you
become
years
of
age
and
need
assistance
to
start
in
business
for
yourself
i
will
gladly
render
it
but
it
is
hardly
safe
for
a
boy
of
eighteen
to
engage
in
such
an
enterprise
get
more
experience
these
words
were
indicative
of
franklin
caution
well
i
have
no
great
desire
to
rule
a
printing
house
i
am
content
to
serve
and
these
words
expressed
benjamin
real
feelings
at
the
same
time
continued
his
father
i
am
highly
gratified
that
you
have
conducted
yourself
so
well
as
to
gain
the
good
opinion
of
even
the
governor
i
trust
that
you
will
continue
to
conduct
yourself
with
propriety
at
you
will
save
money
enough
to
set
up
business
for
yourself
if
your
economy
holds
out
i
think
it
will
responded
benjamin
my
wants
are
few
and
so
my
expenses
are
small
and
i
like
work
as
well
as
ever
there
is
one
thing
i
hope
you
will
avoid
benjamin
you
will
no
doubt
be
writing
for
the
public
press
as
you
did
here
my
advice
is
to
avoid
lampooning
and
libeling
you
erred
in
that
way
here
and
furnished
occasion
for
just
and
severe
criticism
we
have
not
time
to
discuss
that
matter
now
answered
benjamin
but
if
i
were
to
live
my
life
over
again
and
edit
the
in
the
same
circumstances
i
should
repeat
the
same
thing
but
for
that
fight
there
would
be
a
censorship
over
the
press
of
boston
possibly
rejoined
his
father
but
i
think
there
is
a
wiser
course
you
must
live
and
learn
i
regret
exceedingly
that
james
can
not
be
reconciled
to
you
interrupted
his
mother
he
is
indulging
a
very
bad
spirit
and
my
prayer
is
that
he
may
see
the
folly
of
it
before
you
leave
and
be
at
peace
with
you
i
met
him
more
than
half
way
replied
benjamin
and
he
seemed
to
stand
aloof
all
the
more
whenever
he
returns
to
reason
he
will
find
me
ready
and
waiting
to
forget
the
past
it
is
so
painful
to
see
brothers
disagree
and
a
deep
doleful
sigh
escaped
her
heart
as
his
mother
said
it
benjamin
separation
from
his
parents
was
tender
and
affectionate
they
scarcely
expected
to
see
his
face
again
on
this
side
of
the
river
and
they
presented
him
with
several
gifts
as
tokens
of
their
undying
love
with
their
sincere
blessing
upon
him
he
turned
away
from
the
old
home
where
so
many
of
his
happiest
hours
had
been
spent
and
wiping
unbidden
tears
from
his
eyes
found
himself
again
out
on
the
world
great
highway
alone
seeking
his
fortune
xxiv
his
return
and
what
came
of
it
john
left
boston
two
or
three
days
before
benjamin
the
sloop
in
which
benjamin
sailed
stopped
at
newport
where
his
brother
john
lived
affording
him
the
opportunity
to
visit
him
john
was
overcome
by
the
sight
of
benjamin
for
whom
he
ever
had
the
most
sincere
affection
their
meeting
was
as
glad
to
him
as
it
was
unexpected
there
he
met
a
vernon
who
said
i
have
a
bill
of
pounds
currency
in
new
york
which
i
have
no
doubt
can
be
collected
readily
could
you
collect
it
for
me
i
will
do
it
with
pleasure
replied
benjamin
you
can
collect
and
keep
it
until
i
write
what
disposition
to
make
of
it
i
am
not
quite
certain
just
now
very
well
i
will
hold
it
subject
to
your
direction
and
i
will
give
you
an
order
for
the
money
which
will
be
necessary
yes
i
suppose
that
is
the
business
way
his
stay
in
newport
was
very
brief
on
returning
to
the
sloop
in
season
to
sail
he
found
that
several
passengers
had
been
taken
on
board
from
that
town
among
them
was
a
motherly
sort
of
a
quaker
lady
and
also
two
young
women
traveling
together
benjamin
was
a
polite
young
man
and
sought
to
be
of
service
to
them
the
old
quaker
lady
was
attended
by
two
servants
yet
benjamin
found
an
opportunity
to
be
of
some
service
to
her
and
she
appreciated
his
kindness
nor
was
he
indifferent
towards
the
two
young
women
he
made
their
acquaintance
and
showed
them
some
attention
and
they
in
turn
showed
him
attention
with
interest
the
quaker
lady
looked
on
understanding
the
situation
better
than
he
did
and
finally
she
called
him
aside
by
some
kind
of
a
motion
and
said
young
man
beware
of
those
girls
or
they
will
lead
you
astray
how
so
inquired
benjamin
considerably
surprised
they
are
bad
girls
and
thee
is
not
much
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
the
world
you
are
right
madam
i
am
not
much
acquainted
with
the
women
world
and
i
dare
say
they
might
easily
lead
me
astray
benjamin
did
not
exactly
believe
what
the
quakeress
said
but
he
was
a
little
given
to
humor
and
so
he
spoke
as
he
did
it
is
a
serious
matter
young
man
thee
may
depend
on
that
i
know
that
they
are
bad
girls
by
their
actions
they
mean
to
set
a
snare
for
thee
well
i
assure
you
that
i
will
not
fall
into
it
they
have
not
caught
me
yet
and
i
hope
they
wo
added
the
good
lady
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
cut
their
acquaintance
at
once
and
she
stated
some
things
she
had
observed
of
their
acts
and
a
remark
one
of
them
made
all
of
which
convinced
benjamin
that
she
was
right
i
thank
you
for
your
interest
said
benjamin
i
will
not
keep
up
an
acquaintance
with
them
but
will
follow
your
advice
the
good
lady
kept
her
eye
on
benjamin
and
so
did
the
girls
the
latter
plied
their
arts
with
considerable
ingenuity
to
lure
him
on
but
his
eyes
were
opened
now
and
he
avoided
them
as
much
as
he
could
before
reaching
new
york
however
the
girls
managed
to
inform
him
where
they
lived
and
gave
him
a
very
pressing
invitation
to
call
the
outcome
was
as
follows
given
in
his
own
language
as
related
in
his
autobiography
when
we
arrived
at
new
york
they
told
me
where
they
lived
and
invited
me
to
come
and
see
them
but
i
avoided
it
and
it
was
well
i
did
for
the
next
day
the
captain
missed
a
silver
spoon
and
some
other
things
that
had
been
taken
out
of
his
cabin
and
knowing
that
these
were
a
couple
of
strumpets
he
got
a
warrant
to
search
their
lodgings
found
the
stolen
goods
and
had
the
thieves
punished
so
though
we
had
escaped
a
sunken
rock
which
we
scraped
upon
in
the
passage
i
thought
this
escape
of
rather
more
importance
to
me
when
benjamin
arrived
in
new
york
john
collins
was
waiting
there
for
him
but
it
was
john
collins
drunk
waitin
for
you
ben
old
fellow
said
john
patting
him
on
the
back
too
much
under
the
power
of
drink
to
know
exactly
what
the
said
or
did
goin
to
philadelphy
come
on
benjamin
was
taken
by
surprise
and
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
rallying
himself
however
he
replied
you
are
not
the
john
collins
i
invited
to
accompany
me
to
philadelphia
i
do
wish
for
company
you
are
joking
ben
old
fellow
and
another
pat
on
his
back
i
invited
john
collins
to
go
to
philadelphia
with
me
you
are
john
collins
complimentary
again
answered
john
with
a
show
of
temper
it
is
time
retorted
benjamin
it
is
putting
me
into
an
embarrassing
situation
to
be
tied
to
a
drunken
companion
i
rather
be
excused
do
see
how
i
can
you
ben
it
is
too
late
now
and
the
boozy
fellow
appeared
not
to
imagine
that
he
was
making
a
fool
of
himself
on
reaching
john
boarding
place
the
landlord
said
he
has
been
drunk
ever
since
he
reached
new
york
and
he
has
gambled
too
i
judge
what
makes
you
think
he
has
gambled
because
he
is
out
of
money
now
every
cent
he
had
is
gone
i
think
and
he
owes
you
for
board
and
lodgings
yes
he
has
not
paid
me
any
thing
his
appetite
is
complete
master
of
him
well
i
scarcely
know
what
to
do
remarked
benjamin
thoughtfully
and
he
rehearsed
to
the
the
circumstances
of
his
connection
with
john
not
omitting
to
repeat
his
fair
promises
promises
retorted
the
landlord
what
does
he
care
for
promises
a
fellow
with
no
more
control
over
his
appetite
than
he
has
do
care
for
any
thing
he
a
goner
if
i
am
any
judge
benjamin
embraced
the
first
opportunity
to
canvass
the
matter
with
john
and
from
his
own
account
he
was
satisfied
that
the
case
was
full
as
bad
as
the
landlord
had
represented
john
had
not
a
cent
left
and
he
was
in
a
maudlin
state
of
mind
such
as
benjamin
did
not
observe
in
boston
his
was
gone
and
he
appeared
to
glory
in
his
shame
while
benjamin
was
considering
what
to
do
and
attending
to
some
matters
of
business
particularly
collecting
the
pounds
for
vernon
the
captain
of
the
sloop
came
to
him
saying
governor
burnet
wants
to
see
you
who
is
governor
burnet
that
he
should
want
to
see
me
responded
benjamin
in
surprise
one
governor
had
been
after
him
and
now
that
another
was
seeking
his
patronage
was
almost
too
much
to
believe
governor
of
new
york
answered
the
captain
i
had
some
business
with
him
and
i
happened
to
say
that
a
passenger
on
board
my
sloop
had
a
large
quantity
of
books
with
him
and
this
interested
him
so
much
that
he
wanted
i
should
bring
you
to
his
house
i
will
go
replied
benjamin
and
i
must
go
at
once
if
i
go
at
all
they
posted
off
benjamin
querying
on
the
way
whether
the
governor
of
new
york
would
prove
as
friendly
to
him
as
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
it
was
a
pleasant
call
he
had
upon
the
governor
this
dignitary
gave
him
a
cordial
welcome
took
him
into
his
library
conversed
with
him
about
books
and
authors
complimented
him
for
his
love
of
learning
and
his
evident
high
aims
and
invited
him
to
call
whenever
he
should
visit
new
york
benjamin
began
to
think
that
governors
had
a
particular
passion
for
him
and
what
little
vanity
he
possessed
became
inflated
many
years
thereafter
referring
to
the
experience
he
said
this
was
the
second
governor
who
had
done
me
the
honor
to
take
notice
of
me
and
for
a
poor
boy
like
me
it
was
very
pleasing
if
he
had
been
as
foolish
as
some
youth
and
some
men
too
he
would
have
concluded
that
it
pays
to
run
away
since
the
only
boy
that
two
governors
were
known
to
patronize
especially
was
a
runaway
but
we
repeat
what
we
have
said
before
that
benjamin
the
wise
son
never
concluded
that
it
pays
to
run
away
from
home
he
met
with
some
pleasant
experiences
but
they
came
not
through
his
runaway
qualities
but
through
his
aspiring
and
noble
aims
collins
was
not
too
drunk
to
understand
that
benjamin
went
to
see
the
governor
by
invitation
and
he
was
on
tiptoe
to
learn
what
it
all
meant
been
to
see
the
governor
hey
he
said
yes
and
i
should
have
taken
you
if
you
had
not
been
drunk
good
on
you
ben
you
be
governor
yourself
yet
and
john
laughed
at
his
own
suggestion
as
only
a
silly
drinker
will
will
not
john
unless
you
change
your
course
i
have
a
mind
to
leave
you
here
in
new
york
then
i
shall
not
be
disgraced
by
you
in
philadelphia
if
you
ca
keep
sober
for
your
own
sake
nor
mine
i
want
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
this
was
a
revelation
to
john
he
had
not
dreamed
of
being
left
penniless
and
friendless
in
new
york
so
he
was
ready
to
make
promises
of
the
most
flattering
kind
in
order
to
proceed
with
benjamin
to
philadelphia
but
you
promised
me
as
squarely
as
possible
in
boston
that
you
would
not
drink
any
more
continued
benjamin
your
promise
is
not
worth
any
thing
to
me
when
it
is
worth
nothing
to
you
and
it
is
not
worth
as
much
to
you
as
a
glass
of
brandy
i
am
tempted
to
leave
you
and
all
your
truck
in
the
sloop
here
in
new
york
john
begged
and
entreated
benjamin
not
to
desert
him
now
and
promised
by
all
that
was
great
and
good
that
he
would
stop
drinking
and
lead
a
sober
life
in
the
circumstances
benjamin
could
scarcely
do
otherwise
than
to
pay
his
bill
at
the
inn
and
take
him
along
with
him
though
he
very
reluctantly
decided
to
do
so
having
collected
the
pounds
for
vernon
paid
john
bill
and
transacted
some
other
business
by
the
time
the
sloop
was
ready
to
sail
they
proceeded
to
philadelphia
there
is
no
record
preserved
of
his
experience
on
the
sloop
between
new
york
and
philadelphia
except
a
paragraph
in
a
letter
written
by
doctor
franklin
to
doctor
priestley
in
when
the
former
was
years
of
age
he
related
the
experience
in
order
to
illustrate
the
truth
that
all
situations
in
life
have
their
inconveniences
the
paragraph
is
as
follows
in
my
youth
i
was
passenger
in
a
little
sloop
descending
the
river
delaware
there
being
no
wind
we
were
obliged
when
the
ebb
was
spent
to
cast
anchor
and
wait
for
the
next
the
heat
of
the
sun
on
the
vessel
was
excessive
the
company
strangers
to
me
and
not
very
agreeable
near
the
i
saw
what
i
took
to
be
a
pleasant
green
meadow
in
the
middle
of
which
was
a
large
shady
tree
where
it
struck
my
fancy
i
could
sit
and
read
having
a
book
in
my
pocket
and
pass
the
time
agreeably
till
the
tide
turned
i
therefore
prevailed
with
the
captain
to
put
me
ashore
being
landed
i
found
the
greatest
part
of
my
meadow
was
really
a
marsh
in
crossing
which
to
come
at
my
tree
i
was
up
to
my
knees
in
mire
and
i
had
not
placed
myself
under
its
shade
five
minutes
before
the
mosquitoes
in
swarms
found
me
out
attacked
my
legs
hands
and
face
and
made
my
reading
and
my
rest
impossible
so
that
i
returned
to
the
beach
and
called
for
the
boat
to
come
and
take
me
on
board
again
where
i
was
obliged
to
bear
the
heat
i
had
strove
to
quit
and
also
the
laugh
of
the
company
similar
cases
in
the
affairs
of
life
have
since
frequently
fallen
under
my
observation
in
these
modern
days
it
would
be
said
that
when
benjamin
arrived
in
philadelphia
he
had
an
elephant
on
his
hands
the
most
unmanageable
and
dangerous
sort
of
an
elephant
on
one
hands
is
a
dissolute
friend
benjamin
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
with
john
it
troubled
him
exceedingly
but
he
was
wont
to
make
the
best
of
everything
and
so
he
did
in
this
case
he
took
john
with
him
to
his
boarding
place
promising
to
pay
his
bills
until
he
could
find
work
in
some
john
was
well
qualified
for
such
business
and
benjamin
supposed
that
he
could
readily
find
a
situation
his
estimate
of
collins
before
and
after
he
began
to
drink
to
excess
is
given
by
his
own
pen
as
follows
at
new
york
i
found
my
friend
collins
who
had
arrived
there
some
time
before
me
we
had
been
intimate
from
children
and
had
read
the
same
books
together
but
he
had
the
advantage
of
more
time
for
reading
and
studying
and
a
wonderful
genius
for
mathematical
learning
in
which
he
far
outstripped
me
while
i
lived
in
boston
most
of
my
hours
of
leisure
for
conversation
were
spent
with
him
and
he
continued
a
sober
as
well
as
industrious
lad
was
much
respected
for
his
learning
by
several
of
the
clergy
and
other
gentlemen
and
seemed
to
promise
making
a
good
figure
in
life
but
during
my
absence
he
had
acquired
a
habit
of
drinking
brandy
and
i
found
by
his
own
account
as
well
as
that
of
others
that
he
had
been
drunk
every
day
since
his
arrival
at
new
york
and
behaved
himself
in
a
very
extravagant
manner
he
had
gamed
too
and
lost
his
money
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
discharge
his
lodgings
and
defray
his
expenses
on
the
road
and
at
philadelphia
which
proved
a
great
burden
to
me
benjamin
called
upon
governor
keith
as
soon
as
possible
with
a
letter
from
his
father
in
which
the
governor
was
thanked
and
praised
for
his
kindness
to
his
son
your
father
is
too
cautious
remarked
the
governor
after
reading
the
letter
some
young
men
are
better
qualified
to
do
business
for
themselves
at
eighteen
than
others
are
at
he
said
that
he
would
assist
me
at
if
i
should
need
assistance
replied
benjamin
yes
he
says
so
in
this
letter
but
i
think
you
will
be
established
in
a
good
business
three
years
from
now
and
need
no
help
some
aid
now
will
do
more
for
you
than
at
any
future
time
i
dare
say
that
is
true
but
as
father
declines
to
do
it
that
ends
the
matter
i
suppose
no
not
by
any
means
replied
the
governor
earnestly
if
your
father
will
not
set
you
up
in
business
i
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
i
want
a
printing
house
in
this
town
and
a
young
man
like
you
capable
of
running
it
should
be
encouraged
that
is
more
than
i
expected
and
i
shall
feel
myself
under
great
obligations
to
you
for
aid
of
that
kind
if
you
deem
it
best
benjamin
spoke
in
a
tone
of
grateful
feeling
but
without
the
least
show
of
importunity
i
do
deem
it
best
and
i
will
give
you
a
start
in
business
you
can
keep
the
matter
a
secret
continue
at
work
for
keimer
and
use
your
first
leisure
moments
to
make
out
an
inventory
of
what
a
printing
establishment
requires
that
will
be
the
first
thing
how
soon
will
you
want
the
inventory
of
articles
as
soon
as
you
can
make
it
out
i
shall
be
obliged
to
send
to
england
for
them
and
that
will
take
considerable
time
it
was
a
lengthy
interview
that
benjamin
had
with
the
governor
and
he
was
very
much
elated
by
this
turn
of
affairs
it
looked
now
as
if
he
would
start
the
printing
business
in
philadelphia
under
the
patronage
of
the
governor
himself
that
seemed
to
promise
more
than
to
go
into
business
by
the
aid
of
only
a
he
reported
next
to
keimer
who
was
glad
to
welcome
him
back
especially
so
because
he
had
considerable
work
on
hand
and
no
person
could
turn
it
off
like
benjamin
glad
to
see
you
ben
i
suppose
the
governor
will
be
round
to
see
you
when
he
hears
of
your
arrival
keimer
spoke
in
a
vein
of
pleasantry
rather
than
as
a
fling
possibly
unless
he
should
send
for
me
to
call
on
him
the
governor
of
new
york
sent
for
me
governor
burnet
what
do
you
think
of
that
you
are
joking
now
ben
it
ca
be
that
all
the
governors
are
after
you
well
the
governor
of
new
york
was
and
i
went
to
see
him
and
benjamin
went
on
to
describe
his
interview
with
governor
burnet
in
detail
and
how
it
came
about
to
which
keimer
listened
with
the
greatest
interest
and
wonder
governor
burnet
has
the
largest
library
in
this
country
continued
benjamin
and
judging
from
the
number
of
books
i
had
on
the
sloop
he
concluded
that
i
loved
books
and
so
wanted
to
show
me
his
well
answered
keimer
after
being
in
a
sort
of
reverie
some
minutes
if
this
thing
goes
on
you
will
not
be
willing
to
associate
long
with
us
fellows
in
the
printing
business
i
will
give
you
due
notice
when
i
get
to
that
i
will
not
cut
your
acquaintance
suddenly
benjamin
could
treat
the
matter
jocosely
as
well
as
keimer
to
return
to
john
collins
he
sought
a
position
as
clerk
or
bookkeeper
in
several
stores
but
was
unsuccessful
then
he
tried
other
kinds
of
work
but
no
one
appeared
to
want
him
benjamin
went
with
him
to
several
places
to
introduce
him
and
intercede
for
him
but
there
was
no
opening
for
him
days
passed
away
and
still
he
was
without
a
position
and
he
kept
on
drinking
too
not
so
as
he
did
in
new
york
but
enough
to
be
more
or
less
disguised
it
is
your
disgusting
habit
of
intemperance
they
smell
your
breath
or
study
your
face
and
then
do
want
you
around
i
told
you
in
boston
that
no
one
wants
a
drinking
employee
about
patience
was
nearly
exhausted
and
he
spoke
as
he
felt
that
is
your
surmise
you
are
a
fanatic
on
drink
and
are
not
capable
of
exercising
sound
judgement
when
you
come
to
that
john
replied
with
considerable
temper
and
you
would
not
be
capable
of
keeping
your
soul
and
body
together
if
it
were
not
for
my
money
you
have
no
regard
at
all
for
your
word
a
promise
amounts
to
nothing
with
you
and
never
will
until
you
stop
drinking
i
shall
not
stop
drinking
until
i
get
ready
retorted
john
becoming
very
angry
you
are
an
insulting
dog
when
you
get
to
attacking
brandy
brandy
was
john
favorite
beverage
in
philadelphia
as
it
was
in
boston
he
frequently
borrowed
money
of
benjamin
the
latter
not
having
the
heart
to
deny
him
with
which
he
continued
to
gratify
his
appetite
benjamin
often
remonstrated
with
him
and
threatened
to
complain
of
him
but
the
old
friendship
of
former
days
always
came
in
to
favor
john
frequently
they
had
serious
difficulties
for
john
was
very
irritable
and
daily
grew
more
so
yet
benjamin
continued
to
pay
his
board
and
loan
him
a
little
money
from
time
to
time
though
collins
continued
unsuccessful
in
his
search
for
a
position
several
young
men
were
enjoying
a
pastime
on
the
delaware
one
day
boating
among
them
benjamin
and
john
the
latter
was
under
the
influence
of
drink
sufficiently
to
be
very
irritable
and
he
refused
to
take
his
turn
rowing
i
will
be
rowed
home
he
said
in
anger
no
you
wo
unless
you
do
your
part
replied
benjamin
who
thought
it
was
quite
time
to
teach
the
boozy
fellow
a
lesson
then
we
will
stay
here
all
night
on
the
water
snapped
out
john
just
as
you
please
i
can
stay
as
long
as
you
can
said
benjamin
who
had
endured
about
as
much
of
john
impudence
as
he
could
come
ben
let
us
row
him
he
do
know
what
he
is
about
said
one
of
the
other
boys
what
signifies
it
not
one
stroke
replied
benjamin
emphatically
it
is
his
turn
to
row
and
he
row
if
he
is
full
of
brandy
i
make
you
row
you
insulting
dog
exclaimed
john
as
he
rose
and
made
for
benjamin
i
throw
you
overboard
if
you
do
row
approaching
benjamin
with
the
vehemence
of
a
mad
bull
determined
to
throw
him
into
the
river
benjamin
clapped
his
head
under
his
thighs
when
he
came
up
and
struck
at
him
and
rising
pitched
him
head
foremost
into
the
river
he
drown
shouted
one
no
he
wo
answered
benjamin
he
is
a
good
swimmer
and
he
is
not
too
drunk
to
swim
will
you
row
john
shouted
another
no
you
he
shouted
back
with
an
oath
we
take
you
in
when
you
will
promise
to
row
said
benjamin
i
shall
not
promise
to
row
i
drown
first
he
turned
about
to
reach
the
boat
but
just
as
he
was
ready
to
grasp
it
with
his
hand
the
rowers
pushed
it
forward
out
of
his
reach
will
you
row
now
shouted
benjamin
no
but
i
will
give
you
a
thrashing
when
i
can
get
at
you
and
he
continued
to
swim
after
the
boat
the
rowers
pushing
it
forward
out
of
his
reach
whenever
he
got
near
enough
to
seize
it
then
benjamin
would
cry
out
will
you
row
now
john
and
back
the
defiant
answer
would
come
never
but
i
throw
you
into
the
river
if
i
can
get
at
you
then
forward
the
rowers
would
push
the
boat
beyond
his
reach
for
twenty
minutes
this
game
was
played
with
the
miserable
fellow
in
the
water
when
one
of
the
number
said
he
is
giving
out
we
must
take
him
in
or
he
drown
well
we
do
want
to
drown
him
replied
benjamin
i
guess
we
better
take
him
in
then
turning
to
john
he
continued
say
john
we
take
you
in
now
you
are
soaked
outside
as
much
as
you
were
inside
and
stopping
the
boat
they
hauled
the
poor
fellow
in
too
much
exhausted
to
throw
benjamin
or
any
one
else
overboard
john
shouted
benjamin
as
they
laid
him
down
dripping
wet
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
it
do
pay
to
drink
too
much
brandy
you
are
the
only
one
in
the
crowd
who
ca
take
care
of
himself
benjamin
was
rather
severe
but
then
he
had
endured
insult
and
ingratitude
so
long
from
his
old
friend
that
his
patience
was
exhausted
the
outcome
of
this
scrape
on
the
delaware
benjamin
shall
tell
in
his
own
words
we
hardly
exchanged
a
civil
word
after
this
adventure
at
length
a
west
india
captain
who
had
a
commission
to
procure
a
preceptor
for
the
sons
of
a
gentleman
at
barbadoes
met
with
him
and
proposed
to
carry
him
thither
to
fill
the
situation
he
accepted
and
promised
to
remit
what
he
owed
me
out
of
the
first
money
he
should
receive
but
i
never
heard
of
him
after
probably
he
died
a
miserable
sot
in
barbadoes
without
a
friend
to
mark
his
grave
or
write
the
story
of
his
shame
benjamin
lost
of
course
all
the
money
he
had
loaned
him
in
later
life
he
referred
to
the
end
of
john
collins
and
said
that
he
benjamin
received
retribution
for
his
influence
over
collins
when
he
made
him
as
much
of
a
skeptic
as
himself
in
boston
it
was
there
that
he
unsettled
his
mind
as
to
the
reality
of
religion
at
that
time
he
was
industrious
temperate
and
honest
but
losing
his
respect
for
religion
he
was
left
without
restraint
and
went
rapidly
to
ruin
benjamin
was
the
greatest
sufferer
by
his
fall
and
thus
was
terribly
rebuked
for
influencing
him
to
treat
religion
with
contempt
governor
keith
frequently
sent
for
benjamin
to
dine
with
him
that
he
might
converse
with
him
about
the
proposed
printing
house
at
length
benjamin
was
able
to
take
with
him
an
inventory
of
all
the
articles
necessary
for
establishing
a
printing
house
it
is
not
on
a
large
scale
said
benjamin
i
think
i
better
begin
moderately
i
can
enlarge
as
business
increases
that
is
wise
answered
the
governor
but
you
want
a
suitable
outfit
for
a
printing
office
yes
and
my
inventory
contemplates
that
the
cost
will
be
about
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
i
judge
not
so
expensive
as
i
supposed
remarked
governor
keith
i
have
been
thinking
whether
you
better
not
go
to
england
to
purchase
these
articles
you
understand
what
is
wanted
i
had
not
thought
of
that
replied
benjamin
both
surprised
and
pleased
by
the
proposition
to
visit
london
i
should
defer
to
your
judgment
in
that
as
in
other
things
if
you
go
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
sail
with
captain
annis
who
makes
a
trip
once
a
year
from
here
to
london
it
will
be
some
months
before
he
will
sail
so
that
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
think
and
plan
i
think
favorably
of
the
proposition
now
continued
benjamin
i
could
select
the
types
and
see
that
every
thing
ordered
was
good
of
the
kind
and
this
would
be
of
advantage
that
is
what
i
thought
and
more
than
that
while
there
you
can
establish
correspondences
in
the
and
stationery
line
i
think
i
could
and
such
acquaintance
might
prove
of
advantage
to
me
in
other
respects
it
certainly
would
and
i
decide
that
you
get
yourself
ready
to
sail
with
captain
annis
you
can
continue
to
work
for
keimer
still
keeping
the
secret
but
completing
your
plans
this
was
the
final
agreement
and
benjamin
never
dreamed
that
governor
keith
was
not
honest
if
he
had
divulged
to
read
or
bradford
or
even
to
keimer
what
the
governor
proposed
they
would
have
exposed
his
deceitful
unreliable
character
and
the
enterprise
would
have
been
abandoned
xxv
working
reading
and
courting
benjamin
continued
to
work
for
keimer
who
did
not
suspect
that
his
employee
was
planning
to
set
up
business
for
himself
keimer
was
a
very
singular
erratic
man
believing
little
in
the
christian
religion
and
yet
given
to
a
kind
of
fanaticism
on
certain
lines
shalt
not
mar
the
corners
of
thy
he
quoted
from
the
mosaic
law
as
a
reason
for
wearing
a
long
beard
when
benjamin
inquired
of
him
then
you
think
that
passage
means
shalt
not
shave
if
i
understand
you
asked
benjamin
yes
that
is
about
it
and
i
feel
religiously
bound
to
observe
it
well
i
prefer
a
religion
that
is
seated
in
the
heart
instead
of
the
beard
and
there
was
a
twinkle
in
benjamin
eye
when
he
said
it
he
enjoyed
arguing
with
keimer
and
frequently
had
a
contest
with
him
in
argument
keimer
had
come
to
respect
his
abilities
indeed
he
considered
benjamin
the
most
remarkable
young
man
he
ever
met
it
is
the
religion
of
the
heart
that
settles
the
length
of
the
beard
my
youthful
socrates
by
this
reference
to
socrates
keimer
meant
to
slap
benjamin
socratic
method
of
argument
about
which
he
talked
much
ca
you
see
it
and
it
ought
to
settle
the
appetite
also
and
the
quantity
and
kind
of
food
that
goes
into
the
stomach
rejoined
benjamin
quickly
keimer
was
a
large
eater
never
more
satisfied
than
when
devouring
a
good
dinner
that
was
exactly
to
his
taste
on
the
other
hand
while
benjamin
had
abandoned
his
vegetable
diet
he
cared
very
little
about
a
good
dinner
and
seemed
to
eat
one
thing
with
about
as
good
relish
as
another
he
often
discussed
the
subject
with
keimer
and
always
maintained
that
most
people
ate
too
much
meat
his
last
remark
hit
and
keimer
knew
where
i
shall
not
dispute
you
on
that
point
keimer
answered
if
we
had
religion
enough
in
our
hearts
i
suppose
it
would
regulate
all
our
acts
it
ought
to
but
there
is
not
much
prospect
of
its
regulating
you
and
me
at
present
neither
of
us
has
much
to
boast
of
in
that
respect
perhaps
not
i
do
propose
to
carry
my
religion
so
far
as
many
people
do
and
be
fanatical
replied
keimer
not
much
danger
of
it
i
think
retorted
benjamin
you
and
i
will
never
be
charged
with
that
benjamin
was
as
much
of
a
skeptic
as
keimer
only
his
skepticism
took
a
different
turn
keimer
believed
two
things
thoroughly
first
to
wear
the
beard
long
and
second
to
keep
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
as
the
sabbath
benjamin
on
the
other
hand
regarded
these
and
kindred
dogmas
as
of
little
consequence
compared
with
morality
and
industry
he
believed
in
work
and
uprightness
and
that
was
more
than
keimer
believed
or
practised
so
their
disputes
were
frequent
and
animated
of
the
two
benjamin
skepticism
was
the
less
dangerous
i
am
seriously
thinking
of
establishing
a
new
sect
continued
keimer
if
you
will
join
me
i
will
i
can
preach
my
doctrines
and
you
can
confound
all
opponents
by
your
socratic
method
i
shall
want
some
latitude
if
i
join
you
it
is
narrowing
down
a
little
too
much
when
a
creed
contains
but
two
articles
like
yours
and
both
of
those
grave
errors
in
starting
a
sect
i
should
not
insist
upon
those
two
articles
alone
minor
doctrines
will
naturally
gather
about
them
but
i
am
really
in
earnest
about
a
new
sect
ben
and
i
am
only
waiting
to
win
you
over
well
perhaps
i
will
join
you
after
you
adopt
my
creed
to
use
no
animal
food
your
head
will
be
clearer
for
running
your
sect
and
such
respect
for
your
stomach
will
show
more
religion
than
a
long
beard
does
my
constitution
would
not
withstand
that
sort
of
a
diet
it
would
undermine
my
health
temperance
in
eating
and
drinking
never
undermined
any
constitution
retorted
benjamin
you
will
live
twenty
years
longer
to
practise
it
and
possess
a
much
larger
per
cent
of
perhaps
i
will
try
it
if
you
will
and
also
if
you
will
adopt
my
creed
and
go
for
a
new
sect
i
am
ready
to
join
you
any
time
in
discarding
animal
food
and
if
you
succeed
well
then
i
will
talk
with
you
about
the
rest
of
it
agreed
responded
keimer
thinking
that
benjamin
was
really
inclined
to
embrace
his
scheme
whereas
he
was
only
laying
his
plans
for
sport
he
knew
that
a
man
who
liked
a
good
meal
as
well
as
keimer
did
would
have
a
hard
time
on
the
diet
he
proposed
referring
to
it
in
his
autobiography
he
said
he
was
usually
a
great
eater
and
i
wished
to
give
myself
some
diversion
in
him
he
consented
to
try
the
practice
if
i
would
keep
him
company
i
did
so
and
we
held
it
for
three
months
our
provisions
were
purchased
cooked
and
brought
to
us
regularly
by
a
woman
in
the
neighborhood
who
had
from
me
a
list
of
forty
dishes
which
she
prepared
for
us
at
different
times
in
which
there
entered
neither
fish
flesh
nor
fowl
this
whim
suited
me
the
better
at
this
time
from
the
cheapness
of
it
not
costing
us
above
eighteen
pence
sterling
each
per
week
i
have
since
kept
several
lents
most
strictly
leaving
the
common
diet
for
that
and
that
for
the
common
abruptly
without
the
least
inconvenience
so
that
i
think
there
is
little
in
the
advice
of
making
those
changes
by
easy
gradations
i
went
on
pleasantly
but
poor
keimer
suffered
grievously
grew
tired
of
the
project
longed
for
the
flesh
pots
of
egypt
and
ordered
a
roast
pig
he
invited
me
and
two
women
friends
to
dine
with
him
but
it
being
brought
too
soon
upon
the
table
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
and
ate
the
whole
before
we
came
the
trial
resulted
about
as
benjamin
anticipated
and
he
got
out
of
it
as
much
fun
as
he
expected
keimer
proved
himself
a
greater
pig
than
the
one
he
swallowed
at
the
same
time
the
result
left
keimer
without
a
claim
on
benjamin
to
advocate
the
new
sect
so
the
scheme
was
dropped
keimer
was
no
match
for
benjamin
in
disputation
with
the
use
of
the
socratic
way
of
reasoning
benjamin
discomfited
him
every
time
so
that
he
grew
shy
and
suspicious
in
his
ripe
years
benjamin
wrote
of
those
days
and
said
keimer
and
i
lived
on
a
pretty
good
familiar
footing
and
agreed
tolerably
well
for
he
suspected
nothing
of
my
setting
up
he
retained
a
great
deal
of
his
old
enthusiasm
and
loved
argumentation
we
therefore
had
many
disputations
i
used
to
work
him
so
with
my
socratic
method
and
had
trepanned
him
so
often
by
questions
apparently
so
distant
from
any
point
we
had
in
hand
yet
by
degrees
leading
to
the
point
and
bringing
him
into
difficulties
and
contradictions
that
at
last
he
grew
ridiculously
cautious
and
would
hardly
answer
me
the
most
common
question
without
asking
first
do
you
intend
to
infer
from
that
however
it
gave
him
so
high
an
opinion
of
my
abilities
in
the
confuting
way
that
he
seriously
proposed
my
being
his
colleague
in
a
project
he
had
of
setting
up
a
new
sect
he
was
to
preach
the
doctrines
and
i
was
to
confound
all
opponents
benjamin
found
pleasant
literary
associates
in
philadelphia
a
gifted
young
man
usually
attracts
to
himself
bright
young
men
near
his
age
such
was
the
case
with
benjamin
three
young
men
especially
became
his
boon
companions
all
of
them
great
readers
their
literary
tendencies
attracted
benjamin
though
their
characters
were
not
deficient
in
high
aims
and
integrity
their
names
were
charles
osborne
joseph
matson
and
james
ralph
the
first
two
were
clerks
of
charles
brockden
an
eminent
conveyancer
of
the
town
and
the
other
was
a
merchant
clerk
matson
was
a
pious
young
man
of
sterling
integrity
while
the
others
were
more
lax
in
their
religious
opinions
and
principles
all
were
sensible
young
men
much
above
the
average
of
this
class
in
intellectual
endowments
osborne
and
ralph
were
imaginative
and
poetical
and
frequently
tried
their
talents
at
they
formed
a
literary
club
and
spent
their
leisure
time
together
reading
to
each
other
discussing
questions
and
in
other
ways
seeking
sundays
they
devoted
chiefly
to
intellectual
pastime
strolling
along
the
banks
of
the
schuylkill
except
matson
who
was
too
much
of
a
christian
to
desecrate
the
sabbath
he
always
went
to
the
house
of
god
on
sundays
nor
was
he
esteemed
any
less
highly
by
his
skeptical
associates
for
so
doing
you
estimate
your
talent
for
poetry
too
highly
said
osborne
to
ralph
at
one
of
their
literary
interviews
poets
are
born
not
made
and
i
hardly
think
you
was
born
one
much
obliged
for
your
compliment
replied
ralph
not
at
all
disconcerted
by
osborne
rather
personal
remark
but
i
may
become
poet
enough
for
my
own
use
all
poets
are
not
when
they
begin
it
is
practice
that
makes
perfect
you
know
practice
ca
make
a
poet
out
of
a
man
who
is
not
born
one
and
you
are
not
such
continued
osborne
that
piece
that
you
just
read
is
not
particularly
poetical
it
is
good
rhyme
but
it
lacks
the
real
spirit
of
poesy
i
agree
with
you
i
do
not
call
it
good
poetry
but
every
poet
must
begin
and
his
first
piece
can
not
be
his
best
poets
improve
as
well
as
clerks
real
poets
responded
osborne
with
a
peculiar
smile
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
he
continued
you
seem
to
think
that
a
fortune
awaits
a
poet
too
but
you
are
laboring
under
a
great
mistake
there
is
no
money
in
poetry
in
our
day
and
there
never
was
perhaps
not
nevertheless
i
am
confident
that
a
poet
may
readily
win
popularity
and
a
livelihood
at
any
rate
i
am
determined
to
try
it
in
spite
of
your
decidedly
poor
opinion
of
my
abilities
well
my
advice
is
that
you
stick
to
the
business
for
which
you
were
bred
if
you
would
keep
out
of
the
osborne
said
it
more
to
hector
ralph
than
any
thing
a
good
clerk
is
better
than
a
poor
poet
you
will
agree
to
that
benjamin
listened
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
to
the
foregoing
discussion
and
he
saw
that
from
jealousy
or
some
other
cause
osborne
was
not
according
to
ralph
the
credit
to
which
he
was
entitled
and
so
he
interrupted
by
saying
you
set
yourself
up
for
a
critic
osborne
but
i
think
more
of
ralph
as
a
poet
than
i
do
of
you
as
a
critic
you
are
unwilling
to
grant
that
his
productions
have
any
merit
at
all
but
i
think
have
moreover
it
is
a
good
practice
for
him
and
for
all
of
us
to
write
poetry
even
if
it
does
not
come
quite
up
to
milton
it
will
improve
us
in
the
use
of
language
fiddlesticks
it
is
simply
wasting
time
that
might
be
spent
in
profitable
reading
and
good
reading
will
improve
the
mind
more
than
rhyming
osborne
spoke
with
much
earnestness
not
half
so
much
as
your
empty
criticisms
are
wasting
your
breath
replied
benjamin
with
a
smile
but
look
here
i
have
just
thought
of
a
good
exercise
that
we
better
adopt
at
our
next
meeting
each
one
of
us
shall
bring
in
a
piece
of
poetry
of
our
own
composition
and
we
compare
notes
and
criticise
each
other
i
should
like
that
responded
ralph
it
is
a
capital
proposition
perhaps
osborne
may
think
it
will
be
a
waste
of
time
and
breath
not
at
all
answered
osborne
i
agree
to
the
plan
provided
the
subject
shall
be
selected
now
so
that
all
shall
have
fair
play
we
will
do
that
of
course
said
benjamin
have
you
a
subject
to
suggest
none
whatever
unless
it
is
a
paraphrase
of
the
eighteenth
psalm
which
describes
the
descent
of
the
deity
that
is
a
grand
subject
responded
benjamin
what
do
you
say
to
taking
that
ralph
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
subject
and
i
am
in
favor
of
adopting
it
thus
it
was
understood
that
each
one
should
write
a
poetical
paraphrase
of
the
eighteenth
psalm
for
their
next
meeting
and
with
this
understanding
they
separated
just
before
the
time
of
their
next
meeting
ralph
called
upon
benjamin
with
his
paraphrase
and
asked
him
to
examine
it
i
have
been
so
busy
remarked
benjamin
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
write
any
thing
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
say
when
my
turn
comes
to
read
but
i
should
like
to
read
yours
benjamin
read
ralph
article
over
and
then
reread
it
it
is
excellent
better
than
any
poetry
you
have
ever
written
remarked
benjamin
when
he
had
finished
reading
osborne
will
have
to
praise
that
but
he
wo
you
see
if
he
does
osborne
never
allows
the
least
merit
in
any
thing
i
write
his
envy
or
jealousy
or
something
else
hatches
severe
criticism
whether
there
is
reason
for
it
or
not
he
will
do
that
with
this
article
see
if
he
do
if
he
does
it
will
be
proof
that
he
is
prejudiced
against
you
or
is
no
judge
of
poetry
replied
benjamin
suppose
we
try
a
little
game
continued
ralph
i
think
we
can
put
his
judgment
to
a
test
he
is
not
so
jealous
of
you
as
he
is
of
me
now
you
take
this
article
and
produce
it
as
your
own
and
i
will
make
some
excuse
for
not
being
prepared
we
shall
then
get
at
his
real
opinion
of
the
composition
a
very
ingenious
test
ralph
exclaimed
benjamin
i
will
enter
into
the
plan
with
all
my
heart
but
i
must
transcribe
the
article
so
that
he
will
see
that
it
is
in
my
own
handwriting
certainly
and
be
careful
that
you
do
not
let
the
secret
out
so
they
waited
almost
impatiently
for
the
time
of
meeting
both
feeling
almost
sure
that
osborne
would
fall
into
their
net
the
appointed
time
came
matson
was
the
first
to
read
his
production
osborne
came
next
and
his
piece
was
much
better
than
matson
ralph
noticed
two
or
three
blemishes
but
pointed
out
many
beauties
in
it
next
it
was
ralph
turn
to
read
i
am
sorry
to
confess
that
i
have
nothing
to
read
but
i
promise
to
atone
for
this
failure
by
doing
my
part
faithfully
in
future
poets
ought
to
be
ready
at
any
time
remarked
osborne
humorously
looking
at
ralph
it
is
in
order
for
them
to
fail
sometimes
i
think
replied
ralph
especially
if
they
are
not
poets
well
ben
we
must
have
yours
then
you
will
not
disappoint
us
i
think
you
must
excuse
me
this
time
benjamin
answered
feigning
an
unwillingness
to
read
no
ben
no
excuse
for
you
said
osborne
you
have
it
written
i
saw
it
in
your
hand
that
is
true
but
after
listening
to
such
fine
productions
as
we
have
heard
i
am
not
ambitious
to
read
mine
i
think
i
must
correct
it
and
dress
it
up
a
little
before
i
submit
it
for
criticism
that
was
not
in
the
arrangement
ben
when
you
suggested
the
exercise
remarked
ralph
you
are
prepared
and
of
course
we
shall
not
excuse
you
after
much
bantering
and
urging
benjamin
proceeded
to
read
his
apparently
with
much
diffidence
and
all
listened
with
profound
attention
you
must
read
that
again
said
osborne
when
he
finished
reading
it
two
readings
of
such
a
poem
as
that
are
none
too
much
come
read
it
again
benjamin
read
the
article
again
apparently
with
more
confidence
than
at
first
you
surprise
me
ben
exclaimed
osborne
when
the
second
reading
was
finished
you
are
a
genuine
poet
i
had
no
idea
that
you
could
write
like
that
nor
i
added
matson
it
is
better
than
half
the
poetry
that
is
printed
if
the
subject
had
not
been
given
out
i
do
know
but
i
should
have
charged
you
with
stealing
it
what
do
you
say
ralph
inquired
osborne
you
are
a
poet
and
poets
ought
to
be
good
judges
of
such
matters
another
fling
at
claim
to
poetical
ability
i
do
think
it
is
entirely
faultless
remarked
ralph
after
some
hesitation
i
think
you
have
commended
it
full
as
highly
as
it
deserves
not
being
a
poet
however
i
may
not
be
a
good
judge
glancing
his
eye
at
osborne
well
done
ralph
exclaimed
osborne
your
opinion
of
that
production
is
proof
positive
that
you
are
destitute
of
real
poetical
taste
as
i
have
told
you
before
osborne
was
fairly
caught
ralph
and
benjamin
exchanged
glances
as
if
to
inquire
if
their
time
of
avowed
triumph
had
not
come
but
both
appeared
to
conclude
to
keep
the
secret
a
little
longer
they
controlled
their
risibles
successfully
and
allowed
osborne
to
go
on
and
express
himself
still
more
strongly
in
favor
of
the
composition
ralph
walked
home
with
osborne
in
order
to
play
the
game
a
little
more
and
their
conversation
was
very
naturally
about
poetry
i
had
no
idea
remarked
osborne
that
ben
could
write
poetry
like
that
i
was
ashamed
of
my
own
when
i
heard
his
i
knew
him
to
be
a
talented
fellow
but
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
a
poet
his
production
was
certainly
very
fine
in
common
conversation
he
seems
to
have
no
choice
of
words
he
hesitates
and
blunders
and
yet
how
he
writes
possibly
he
might
not
have
written
it
suggested
ralph
a
very
natural
suggestion
in
the
circumstances
though
osborne
thought
it
was
an
outrageous
reflection
that
is
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
retorted
osborne
to
charge
him
with
plagiarism
ben
would
never
descend
to
so
mean
a
thing
as
that
they
separated
for
that
night
but
ralph
embraced
the
first
opportunity
to
call
on
benjamin
to
exult
over
the
success
of
their
little
scheme
they
laughed
to
their
hearts
content
and
discussed
the
point
of
revealing
the
secret
they
concluded
finally
that
the
real
author
of
the
article
should
be
known
at
their
next
meeting
accordingly
the
affair
was
managed
so
as
to
bring
the
facts
of
the
case
before
their
companions
at
their
next
gathering
osborne
was
utterly
confounded
when
the
revelation
was
made
and
knew
not
what
to
say
for
himself
matson
shook
his
whole
frame
with
convulsive
laughter
at
poor
osborne
expense
and
benjamin
joined
him
with
a
keen
relish
never
was
a
fellow
in
a
more
mortifying
predicament
than
this
critic
since
it
was
now
perfectly
manifest
that
he
was
influenced
by
blind
prejudice
in
his
criticisms
of
ralph
poetry
for
now
disarmed
of
prejudice
he
had
given
it
his
most
emphatic
endorsement
a
few
years
later
matson
died
in
benjamin
arms
much
lamented
by
all
of
his
companions
who
regarded
him
as
the
best
of
their
set
osborne
removed
to
the
west
indies
where
he
became
an
eminent
lawyer
but
died
just
past
middle
life
of
the
others
we
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
hereafter
benjamin
always
spoke
well
of
that
literary
club
it
was
an
excellent
way
of
using
leisure
time
it
contributed
much
to
his
as
it
did
to
that
of
his
companions
such
an
arrangement
converts
spare
moments
into
great
blessings
the
time
was
drawing
near
for
benjamin
to
leave
for
england
and
there
was
one
thing
above
all
others
that
he
wished
to
do
viz
to
be
betrothed
to
deborah
read
they
had
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
but
were
not
engaged
he
had
not
opened
the
subject
to
her
parents
but
he
must
if
he
would
win
her
hand
before
going
to
england
so
he
ventured
both
of
you
are
too
young
replied
deborah
mother
you
are
only
eighteen
you
can
not
tell
what
changes
may
occur
before
you
are
old
enough
to
be
married
but
that
need
not
interfere
with
an
engagement
suggested
benjamin
we
only
pledge
each
to
the
other
against
the
time
we
are
ready
to
be
married
sometimes
parties
are
engaged
for
years
before
they
are
married
it
is
not
a
good
plan
however
and
why
benjamin
do
you
deem
an
engagement
necessary
in
the
circumstances
simply
because
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
answered
benjamin
laughing
read
laughed
too
i
have
not
quite
satisfied
myself
that
it
is
best
to
give
up
my
daughter
to
a
printer
she
added
how
so
inquired
benjamin
with
some
anxiety
because
there
are
already
several
printing
houses
in
the
country
and
i
doubt
whether
another
can
be
supported
if
i
can
not
support
her
by
the
printing
business
then
i
will
do
it
by
some
other
responded
benjamin
emphatically
i
do
not
call
in
question
your
good
intentions
by
any
means
but
you
may
not
realize
the
fulfillment
of
your
hopes
i
think
you
had
better
leave
the
matter
as
it
is
until
you
return
from
england
and
see
how
you
are
prospered
of
course
i
shall
yield
to
your
judgment
in
the
matter
said
benjamin
very
politely
though
i
shall
be
somewhat
disappointed
you
and
deborah
can
have
such
understanding
with
each
other
as
you
wish
but
i
object
to
a
formal
engagement
leave
that
until
you
return
read
was
decided
in
her
opinions
her
husband
died
five
or
six
weeks
before
this
interview
so
benjamin
had
to
leave
his
bird
in
the
bush
instead
of
having
it
in
hand
and
the
bird
promised
to
stay
there
and
sing
for
him
on
his
return
xxvi
a
bogus
scheme
i
thinking
of
going
to
england
with
you
said
ralph
to
benjamin
one
day
in
october
you
do
mean
it
i
do
mean
it
i
am
thinking
seriously
of
going
i
shall
be
delighted
to
have
your
company
but
the
news
is
almost
too
good
to
be
true
continued
benjamin
i
have
been
looking
the
matter
over
ever
since
you
told
me
that
you
expected
to
go
and
now
it
is
settled
in
my
own
mind
that
i
shall
go
going
out
for
your
employer
no
going
out
to
establish
a
correspondence
if
possible
and
arrange
to
obtain
goods
to
sell
on
commission
that
is
a
capital
scheme
it
seems
to
me
ralph
i
think
you
can
establish
a
good
business
with
your
tact
and
experience
you
have
to
hurry
up
for
i
expect
that
captain
annis
will
sail
in
three
weeks
benjamin
words
showed
his
gladness
that
one
of
his
intimate
companions
would
accompany
him
it
wo
take
me
long
to
get
ready
i
have
been
arranging
matters
for
some
time
with
reference
to
going
though
i
have
spoken
to
no
one
about
it
ralph
was
careful
not
to
divulge
the
real
reason
of
his
going
lest
benjamin
should
disapprove
at
length
it
was
announced
that
the
captain
annis
master
would
sail
about
the
of
november
and
now
benjamin
was
full
of
business
he
made
known
his
intentions
to
keimer
and
other
friends
without
disclosing
the
real
object
of
his
trip
or
that
he
was
going
under
the
patronage
of
governor
keith
considerable
surprise
and
regret
were
expressed
by
several
friends
that
he
was
going
and
yet
they
were
free
to
say
that
it
would
prove
an
excellent
school
for
such
a
young
man
as
benjamin
governor
keith
was
lavish
in
his
attentions
and
interest
you
will
want
letters
of
introduction
from
me
and
i
shall
have
some
instructions
which
i
will
write
out
carefully
he
said
the
letters
will
be
indispensable
and
the
instructions
i
shall
most
surely
need
to
relieve
my
lack
of
experience
benjamin
replied
i
will
have
them
all
ready
two
or
three
days
before
captain
annis
sails
added
the
governor
and
you
can
call
for
them
i
may
want
to
see
you
again
before
i
get
them
ready
and
i
will
send
for
you
benjamin
thanked
governor
keith
for
his
great
kindness
assuring
him
that
he
should
always
feel
himself
under
a
heavy
debt
of
gratitude
never
dreaming
that
the
scheming
politician
was
luring
him
into
a
snare
he
put
his
whole
heart
and
soul
into
preparation
to
leave
to
him
it
was
the
great
event
of
his
life
and
it
would
have
been
if
sir
william
keith
had
been
an
honest
man
instead
of
a
rogue
for
an
american
youth
eighteen
years
of
age
to
represent
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
in
the
city
of
london
to
consummate
a
business
enterprise
of
the
greatest
importance
to
a
thriving
american
town
was
an
unusual
occurrence
any
youth
of
considerable
ability
and
ambition
must
have
realized
the
value
and
dignity
of
the
enterprise
but
to
such
a
youth
as
benjamin
was
talented
aspiring
coveting
success
striving
for
the
best
the
opportunity
of
this
business
enterprise
proposed
and
patronized
by
the
highest
officer
in
the
colony
must
have
appealed
strongly
to
his
manly
and
noble
nature
we
shall
see
however
as
it
turned
out
that
all
the
honesty
and
purpose
that
invested
it
was
in
benjamin
soul
treachery
dishonesty
and
perfidy
blackened
the
soul
of
his
patron
loading
him
down
with
infamy
almost
without
a
parallel
three
days
before
captain
annis
set
sail
benjamin
called
for
his
letters
my
time
has
been
so
thoroughly
occupied
by
public
business
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
prepare
them
but
i
will
attend
to
it
i
can
call
again
without
any
trouble
answered
benjamin
exceedingly
grateful
for
the
governor
patronage
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
prepare
them
but
i
will
not
disappoint
you
again
call
day
after
the
more
the
governor
said
and
promised
the
more
thankful
benjamin
felt
that
he
had
fallen
into
such
generous
hands
i
will
call
in
the
afternoon
day
after
replied
benjamin
and
thanking
him
again
for
his
great
kindness
took
his
leave
he
called
as
he
promised
for
the
letters
and
other
papers
instead
of
being
ushered
into
the
governor
presence
as
usual
his
secretary
colonel
french
came
out
to
announce
the
governor
regrets
exceedingly
that
he
has
not
the
documents
ready
yet
and
desires
that
you
shall
call
again
just
before
the
vessel
sails
very
well
i
will
call
replied
benjamin
without
the
least
suspicion
that
any
trouble
was
brewing
for
him
on
the
next
day
with
all
his
baggage
on
board
and
the
said
to
all
his
friends
he
hastened
to
the
governor
for
his
papers
again
colonel
french
met
him
with
the
announcement
the
governor
desires
me
to
say
that
he
is
really
ashamed
to
disappoint
you
again
but
a
constant
pressure
of
business
has
prevented
but
the
vessel
will
stop
at
newcastle
and
he
will
meet
you
and
deliver
yours
with
other
letters
he
has
to
send
and
he
hopes
that
you
will
have
a
pleasant
voyage
and
meet
with
great
success
please
convey
my
thanks
to
him
for
his
many
kindnesses
and
present
good
wishes
answered
benjamin
and
say
to
him
that
i
will
execute
his
commands
to
the
very
best
of
my
ability
and
report
at
the
earliest
possible
time
so
saying
benjamin
returned
and
boarded
the
vessel
which
soon
dropped
down
the
delaware
thinking
all
the
while
of
his
good
fortune
in
having
so
great
and
good
a
man
as
governor
keith
for
his
friend
at
newcastle
benjamin
landed
and
hastened
to
see
the
governor
whom
he
expected
to
be
there
as
colonel
french
said
but
he
met
only
the
secretary
who
announced
again
the
governor
is
now
writing
the
last
dispatch
and
will
send
your
documents
with
others
on
board
before
the
ship
weighs
anchor
he
would
be
glad
to
see
you
again
before
you
leave
but
requires
me
to
say
that
every
moment
of
his
time
will
be
occupied
to
the
very
last
minute
so
he
must
content
himself
with
sending
to
you
by
me
his
last
words
of
confidence
and
his
best
wishes
convey
mine
also
to
him
benjamin
replied
as
he
turned
away
to
go
to
the
vessel
just
as
the
ship
was
about
to
sail
a
bag
of
letters
and
other
documents
came
on
board
from
the
governor
benjamin
supposed
that
it
contained
his
indispensable
letters
and
at
a
suitable
time
he
went
to
the
captain
and
said
governor
keith
was
to
furnish
me
with
letters
of
introduction
to
friends
in
london
and
i
suppose
they
are
in
the
bag
which
he
sent
aboard
can
i
look
them
over
for
my
letters
just
now
i
am
too
busy
to
give
the
matter
any
attention
captain
annis
said
but
i
assure
you
that
long
before
we
reach
london
you
shall
have
the
opportunity
to
examine
and
take
what
belongs
to
you
that
will
do
i
thank
you
replied
benjamin
perfectly
satisfied
that
all
was
right
and
he
settled
down
to
enjoy
the
voyage
when
the
vessel
entered
the
english
channel
captain
annis
brought
out
the
bag
of
documents
from
the
governor
for
benjamin
to
inspect
he
was
surprised
beyond
measure
not
to
find
any
letters
addressed
to
himself
he
found
several
addressed
to
other
parties
with
his
name
written
upon
them
as
under
his
care
but
not
one
addressed
to
himself
it
was
very
singular
he
thought
but
he
concluded
that
one
of
the
number
was
devoted
to
his
mission
as
it
was
addressed
to
baskett
the
printer
he
found
seven
or
eight
letters
addressed
to
different
parties
care
of
benjamin
franklin
and
he
took
them
all
from
the
bag
he
still
supposed
that
every
thing
about
his
mission
was
correct
they
arrived
in
london
on
the
of
december
when
benjamin
lacked
about
a
month
of
being
nineteen
years
old
with
ralph
he
proceeded
to
find
lodgings
at
once
and
just
as
soon
as
that
arrangement
was
made
he
hastened
to
deliver
the
letters
submitted
to
his
care
the
first
party
upon
whom
he
called
was
a
stationer
i
have
the
honor
of
bringing
a
letter
to
you
sir
from
governor
keith
of
pennsylvania
america
he
said
with
considerable
assurance
i
have
not
the
honor
of
his
acquaintance
answered
the
stationer
pray
tell
me
who
governor
keith
may
be
the
letter
will
inform
you
no
doubt
replied
benjamin
giving
him
the
letter
the
stationer
opened
it
but
read
scarcely
three
lines
before
he
exclaimed
to
benjamin
consternation
oh
this
is
from
riddlesden
i
have
lately
found
him
to
be
a
complete
rascal
and
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
nor
receive
any
letters
from
him
and
he
handed
the
letter
back
to
benjamin
without
reading
all
of
it
turned
upon
his
heel
and
went
back
to
his
work
benjamin
feelings
can
be
imagined
better
than
described
he
was
dumbfounded
to
learn
that
the
letter
was
not
from
governor
keith
and
then
it
was
that
the
first
flash
of
suspicion
that
he
had
been
deceived
entered
his
mind
he
was
still
more
surprised
to
learn
on
examination
that
not
one
of
the
letters
he
had
taken
from
the
bag
was
written
by
governor
keith
there
he
was
without
one
letter
of
introduction
to
any
person
in
london
the
scheme
of
establishing
a
printing
house
in
philadelphia
discovered
to
be
a
myth
a
mere
boy
friendless
and
without
work
in
a
great
city
three
thousand
miles
from
home
if
another
american
youth
was
ever
lured
into
a
baser
trap
by
a
baser
official
his
name
has
never
been
recorded
benjamin
was
at
his
wits
end
he
knew
not
what
to
do
his
feelings
bordered
upon
despair
had
he
not
been
a
wonderful
youth
to
rise
superior
to
difficulties
he
must
have
yielded
to
overwhelming
discouragement
to
add
to
his
troubles
when
he
disclosed
his
situation
to
ralph
he
learned
that
his
old
companion
had
abandoned
his
wife
and
child
never
intending
to
return
to
america
you
are
a
wretch
i
never
would
have
thought
such
a
thing
of
you
ralph
he
exclaimed
such
meanness
ought
to
be
left
to
baser
men
than
you
are
i
suppose
that
you
would
never
look
with
any
favor
upon
such
a
plan
as
mine
and
so
i
did
not
tell
you
replied
ralph
it
is
lucky
for
you
that
you
did
not
for
i
never
would
have
consented
to
be
the
companion
of
a
young
man
running
away
from
his
wife
and
child
well
i
have
never
been
treated
well
by
one
member
of
my
family
from
the
day
i
was
married
and
before
too
i
have
borne
it
without
complaining
to
any
one
until
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
now
let
them
reflect
but
that
is
no
excuse
for
a
man
to
abandon
his
family
no
excuse
whatever
why
ralph
i
am
almost
as
much
deceived
in
you
as
i
have
been
in
governor
keith
i
did
not
think
that
you
were
capable
of
such
meanness
benjamin
meant
every
word
he
uttered
and
he
was
not
disposed
to
spare
his
old
friend
at
all
another
bit
of
information
just
here
magnified
his
sorrows
i
am
out
of
funds
entirely
ben
so
that
i
have
begun
to
be
cursed
already
you
see
without
yours
ralph
spoke
as
if
the
remarks
of
ben
cut
him
to
the
quick
out
of
money
exclaimed
ben
come
here
dead
broke
you
must
be
crazy
ralph
abandon
your
family
and
shove
yourself
upon
me
to
support
in
london
i
am
shocked
i
am
afraid
that
both
of
us
will
be
more
shocked
than
that
before
we
get
through
answered
ralph
with
the
utmost
coolness
you
have
been
too
good
a
friend
to
desert
me
now
ben
the
last
remark
touched
a
tender
spot
in
benjamin
heart
he
and
ralph
had
been
true
friends
and
passed
many
happy
hours
together
he
abhorred
his
inhumanity
to
his
wife
and
child
and
his
deceitfulness
in
claiming
to
go
to
london
to
secure
goods
to
sell
on
commission
and
establish
correspondence
but
he
had
no
heart
to
abandon
him
in
a
strange
city
get
work
ralph
as
soon
as
possible
or
we
shall
be
in
a
bad
plight
for
i
have
only
fifteen
pistoles
in
all
which
will
not
keep
up
a
connection
between
soul
and
body
long
this
remark
of
implied
that
he
should
divide
what
he
had
with
ralph
as
long
as
it
lasted
i
shall
do
that
ben
you
may
rest
assured
for
i
will
not
take
advantage
of
your
generosity
any
longer
than
i
can
help
i
mean
to
continue
a
good
friend
of
yours
whether
you
continue
to
be
a
good
friend
of
mine
or
not
this
was
a
shrewd
way
of
putting
it
ralph
knew
the
young
man
he
was
talking
with
thoroughly
benjamin
resolved
to
seek
the
advice
of
denham
he
was
a
quaker
merchant
who
sailed
from
philadelphia
with
him
he
was
a
stranger
to
him
but
when
colonel
french
came
on
board
with
letters
from
the
governor
at
newcastle
he
introduced
benjamin
to
denham
for
this
reason
denham
became
deeply
interested
in
benjamin
and
showed
him
many
favors
now
his
advice
would
be
specially
useful
to
benjamin
so
he
sought
and
found
him
i
find
denham
that
governor
keith
has
been
deceiving
me
i
came
here
under
his
auspices
and
he
promised
me
letters
of
introduction
to
parties
and
the
means
to
purchase
an
outfit
for
a
printing
house
in
philadelphia
and
he
has
not
fulfilled
either
promise
there
are
no
letters
for
me
among
the
dispatches
he
sent
on
board
at
newcastle
he
has
proved
himself
a
fraud
and
a
cheat
he
always
did
that
denham
replied
if
i
had
known
that
you
were
depending
on
keith
for
any
thing
i
could
have
opened
your
eyes
to
his
rascality
at
once
keith
is
an
official
scamp
here
is
a
letter
from
riddlesden
to
a
stationer
here
and
passing
the
letter
to
denham
he
rehearsed
his
interview
with
the
stationer
riddlesden
exclaimed
denham
so
base
an
never
cursed
pennsylvania
he
is
matched
in
perfidy
only
by
keith
two
worse
rogues
never
occupied
important
positions
in
any
country
then
reading
the
letter
through
he
went
on
and
this
very
letter
proves
that
he
is
an
arrant
knave
for
here
is
proof
of
a
conspiracy
against
hamilton
who
was
booked
to
sail
with
captain
annis
and
keith
is
in
it
denham
read
the
letter
to
benjamin
explaining
its
meaning
as
he
went
along
for
he
was
well
posted
about
keith
and
the
villainous
attorney
you
should
keep
this
letter
franklin
and
show
it
to
hamilton
when
he
comes
added
denham
hamilton
will
come
just
as
soon
as
he
can
he
came
aboard
our
ship
with
his
son
intending
to
come
but
a
party
appeared
offering
him
a
very
large
fee
to
wait
and
conduct
a
case
in
court
and
he
consented
he
is
the
greatest
lawyer
in
pennsylvania
keep
the
letter
and
give
it
to
him
we
may
say
here
once
for
all
that
benjamin
did
keep
the
letter
until
the
arrival
of
hamilton
several
months
later
when
he
presented
it
to
him
for
which
favor
hamilton
was
very
grateful
and
became
benjamin
friend
but
what
can
i
do
mr
denham
asked
benjamin
i
am
here
a
stranger
in
a
strange
city
with
very
little
money
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
i
do
not
see
but
one
thing
that
you
can
do
just
now
you
are
a
printer
and
you
can
get
work
without
doubt
in
some
printing
office
until
you
see
fit
to
return
i
thought
of
that
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
an
american
printer
would
be
at
a
discount
here
where
the
printing
business
is
so
much
better
understood
suggested
benjamin
you
can
get
over
that
difficulty
quickly
by
showing
them
what
you
can
do
answered
denham
you
have
more
intelligence
and
culture
than
most
of
the
english
printers
and
that
will
help
you
i
will
lose
no
time
in
making
an
application
for
a
place
said
benjamin
i
am
under
obligations
to
you
for
your
interest
in
me
it
may
prove
of
great
advantage
to
you
to
have
this
opportunity
to
become
familiar
with
printing
in
london
continued
denham
you
can
perfect
yourself
in
the
art
against
the
time
you
return
and
set
up
business
in
philadelphia
so
you
may
get
some
good
out
of
your
trials
after
all
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
one
any
good
it
looks
so
certainly
benjamin
answered
i
will
accept
your
advice
and
see
what
i
can
do
benjamin
had
too
dear
for
the
again
but
he
made
the
best
of
it
first
of
all
he
found
a
permanent
for
himself
and
ralph
where
the
charges
were
in
proportion
to
his
pecuniary
ability
it
was
in
little
britain
street
and
the
weekly
charge
was
only
three
shillings
and
sixpence
then
both
started
out
in
search
of
work
benjamin
went
direct
to
palmer
famous
printing
house
in
bartholomew
close
where
fifty
hands
were
then
employed
and
applied
for
a
situation
what
experience
have
you
had
inquired
the
overseer
several
years
i
learned
the
business
of
my
brother
james
franklin
in
boston
america
and
he
came
to
your
country
and
learned
it
before
setting
up
the
business
in
his
own
country
you
ought
to
understand
it
then
but
why
do
you
seek
work
in
this
country
i
did
not
come
to
london
for
work
but
for
an
outfit
with
which
to
establish
the
business
in
philadelphia
and
benjamin
rehearsed
his
arrangement
with
governor
keith
and
the
treachery
which
had
been
practised
upon
him
which
interested
the
manager
very
much
and
at
the
same
time
won
his
sympathy
though
governor
keith
proved
so
treacherous
to
you
the
facts
show
his
confidence
in
your
ability
as
a
printer
he
remarked
and
surely
in
these
misfortunes
a
friend
in
need
is
a
friend
indeed
i
think
i
can
find
something
for
you
to
do
you
can
try
me
and
i
shall
be
very
thankful
for
the
chance
benjamin
answered
i
have
no
desire
to
work
for
any
man
unless
i
can
suit
him
that
is
an
honorable
view
of
the
matter
and
i
have
no
doubt
of
your
ability
to
satisfy
me
you
can
come
at
once
and
i
will
give
you
a
position
they
agreed
upon
wages
that
were
satisfactory
to
benjamin
and
the
next
day
he
went
to
work
the
truth
was
that
the
boss
of
printing
house
was
very
much
pleased
with
benjamin
appearance
he
saw
at
once
that
he
was
a
young
man
of
uncommon
ability
he
was
surprised
to
learn
that
he
was
not
quite
nineteen
years
of
age
since
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
young
man
of
therefore
he
was
not
only
desirous
of
aiding
him
in
his
embarrassing
situation
but
he
was
glad
to
employ
a
young
man
of
so
much
promise
ralph
was
not
so
successful
here
and
there
he
applied
for
work
but
no
one
appeared
to
want
him
benjamin
rendered
him
all
the
assistance
possible
evenings
but
his
efforts
met
with
no
success
in
advanced
life
benjamin
spoke
of
ralph
efforts
as
follows
he
first
endeavored
to
get
into
the
playhouse
believing
himself
qualified
for
an
actor
but
wilkes
to
whom
he
applied
advised
him
candidly
not
to
think
of
that
employment
as
it
was
impossible
he
should
succeed
in
it
then
he
proposed
to
roberts
a
publisher
in
pater
noster
row
to
write
for
him
a
weekly
paper
like
the
on
certain
conditions
which
roberts
did
not
approve
then
he
endeavored
to
get
employment
as
a
hackney
writer
to
copy
for
the
stationers
and
lawyers
about
the
temple
but
could
not
find
a
vacancy
ralph
possessed
considerable
ability
as
an
amateur
player
of
tragedy
or
comedy
and
he
was
quite
a
racy
writer
also
hence
his
application
for
a
situation
as
above
benjamin
was
familiar
with
his
qualifications
on
the
lines
mentioned
and
seconded
his
efforts
as
best
he
could
but
all
to
no
purpose
as
ralph
had
no
money
or
work
benjamin
was
obliged
to
support
him
he
paid
his
board
and
loaned
him
small
sums
from
time
to
time
so
that
he
could
maintain
the
appearance
of
a
respectable
citizen
but
he
was
another
elephant
on
benjamin
hands
the
weeks
multiplied
and
still
ralph
had
no
employment
he
was
a
constant
bill
of
expense
willing
to
work
abhorring
a
life
of
idleness
his
condition
and
prospects
were
a
torment
to
himself
he
was
more
troubled
even
than
benjamin
over
his
misfortune
at
length
however
he
announced
i
am
going
to
put
an
end
to
this
sort
of
a
life
ben
i
have
stood
it
as
long
as
i
can
i
am
going
out
into
the
country
to
find
a
school
to
teach
i
am
told
that
i
can
easily
find
one
not
a
bad
idea
in
the
circumstances
replied
benjamin
teaching
is
an
honorable
and
useful
business
and
it
will
make
you
friends
i
should
much
prefer
to
remain
in
this
city
and
find
a
more
congenial
situation
but
beggars
ca
be
choosers
and
so
i
have
concluded
to
make
the
best
of
it
i
am
completely
discouraged
in
trying
for
work
in
london
ralph
spoke
as
he
felt
for
he
had
become
disheartened
it
seems
strange
almost
continued
benjamin
that
you
can
find
no
situation
of
any
sort
in
this
great
city
where
i
was
not
born
under
a
lucky
star
as
you
were
ben
interrupted
ralph
my
experience
with
governor
keith
does
show
much
of
a
star
any
way
rejoined
benjamin
certainly
it
is
not
a
lucky
one
nor
a
morning
star
if
it
is
a
star
at
all
it
must
be
an
star
seen
only
when
it
is
getting
dark
i
wish
i
could
accept
disappointment
and
defeat
as
philosophically
as
you
can
ben
but
i
ca
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
make
the
best
out
of
the
worst
but
you
can
it
is
the
way
i
am
made
no
doubt
said
benjamin
in
reply
i
never
could
make
any
thing
by
fretting
nor
any
body
else
quickly
answered
ralph
and
still
i
fret
and
worry
as
if
thereby
i
could
mend
the
matter
but
i
am
going
to
strike
out
for
a
school
and
leave
london
to
suffer
the
consequences
of
not
employing
me
that
is
philosophical
sure
added
benjamin
the
school
was
secured
within
a
short
time
and
ralph
became
a
schoolmaster
a
few
miles
out
of
london
benjamin
continued
to
serve
in
the
palmer
printing
house
where
he
gave
satisfaction
and
made
his
mark
as
we
shall
see
xxvii
our
a
letter
from
ralph
to
benjamin
informed
the
latter
that
the
former
was
settled
in
a
small
village
called
berkshire
where
he
was
teaching
about
a
dozen
boys
in
reading
and
writing
at
a
sixpence
each
per
week
not
a
very
flattering
position
but
in
the
circumstances
better
than
none
what
surprised
benjamin
however
was
that
ralph
had
changed
his
name
and
was
known
in
that
village
as
franklin
he
had
assumed
name
thinking
that
such
a
position
was
not
honorable
for
james
ralph
to
occupy
at
first
benjamin
was
somewhat
displeased
to
find
himself
scattered
about
in
such
a
way
printer
and
schoolmaster
and
he
knew
not
what
next
but
on
the
whole
he
concluded
to
let
the
matter
rest
and
if
his
old
friend
could
get
success
out
of
his
name
allow
him
to
do
it
so
he
corresponded
with
him
from
time
to
time
directing
his
letters
to
franklin
schoolmaster
as
ralph
desired
it
was
not
long
before
benjamin
began
to
receive
instalments
of
an
epic
poem
which
ralph
was
composing
with
the
request
to
examine
and
return
remarks
and
corrections
benjamin
did
examine
and
return
it
with
the
advice
to
cease
writing
epic
poems
and
attend
to
his
legitimate
business
or
get
into
some
other
but
it
was
of
no
use
the
poem
continued
to
come
by
instalments
at
this
juncture
too
another
trial
was
added
to
his
singular
experience
ralph
english
wife
called
upon
him
for
help
the
following
is
franklin
account
of
the
manner
in
which
ralph
came
into
these
new
relations
in
our
house
lodged
a
young
woman
a
milliner
who
i
think
had
a
shop
in
the
cloisters
she
had
been
genteelly
bred
was
sensible
lively
and
of
a
most
pleasing
conversation
ralph
read
plays
to
her
in
the
evenings
they
grew
intimate
she
took
another
lodging
and
he
followed
her
they
lived
together
some
time
but
he
being
still
out
of
business
and
her
income
not
sufficient
to
maintain
them
with
her
child
he
took
a
resolution
of
going
from
london
to
try
for
a
country
school
i
need
help
and
know
not
where
to
go
except
to
you
said
ralph
indeed
james
told
me
to
apply
to
you
i
recall
replied
benjamin
that
he
asked
me
in
one
of
his
letters
to
see
that
you
were
not
in
want
i
am
not
in
circumstances
to
do
much
for
you
but
i
will
cheerfully
do
what
i
can
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
for
the
smallest
favor
my
wants
are
few
and
i
can
make
a
little
assistance
go
a
good
way
benjamin
relieved
her
wants
and
from
that
time
continued
to
call
upon
her
to
see
that
she
was
made
comfortable
and
to
enjoy
her
company
these
demands
upon
his
purse
kept
it
drained
to
the
last
cent
all
the
time
so
that
he
could
lay
nothing
by
for
himself
he
could
see
no
way
out
of
his
trouble
he
must
continue
penniless
or
let
ralph
and
his
family
suffer
but
just
then
an
indiscreet
act
on
his
part
offended
ralph
who
coming
to
london
for
a
day
or
two
said
to
benjamin
i
consider
myself
under
no
obligations
to
you
whatever
from
this
time
i
shall
ask
no
more
favors
of
you
for
myself
or
family
and
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
very
well
replied
benjamin
i
will
so
understand
it
in
this
way
benjamin
was
relieved
of
a
great
burden
unexpectedly
incumbrances
thus
removed
he
devoted
himself
with
remarkable
energy
and
industry
to
his
business
and
about
this
time
benjamin
was
offered
larger
pay
at
watts
printing
house
near
lincoln
inn
fields
and
he
removed
thither
he
changed
his
also
to
duke
street
opposite
the
romish
chapel
next
door
to
benjamin
lodgings
was
a
bookstore
kept
by
one
wilcox
he
had
an
immense
collection
of
books
in
which
of
course
benjamin
became
much
interested
spending
his
leisure
time
here
i
have
not
the
money
to
make
purchases
he
said
to
wilcox
i
wish
i
had
there
are
so
many
valuable
books
here
and
they
are
so
cheap
that
i
wish
i
was
able
to
make
many
of
them
my
own
well
you
are
at
liberty
to
spend
all
the
time
you
can
reading
them
here
answered
wilcox
who
had
already
formed
a
high
opinion
of
his
abilities
perhaps
some
day
you
will
be
able
to
own
some
of
them
you
are
very
kind
indeed
wilcox
and
i
shall
avail
myself
of
your
generosity
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
some
of
these
authors
benjamin
had
already
rehearsed
the
story
of
the
fraud
through
which
he
became
a
london
printer
so
that
wilcox
understood
the
reason
that
he
was
penniless
glad
to
see
you
here
any
time
feel
perfectly
at
home
and
get
all
the
good
you
can
out
of
these
books
wilcox
added
with
great
kindness
it
was
not
long
before
an
original
idea
about
the
use
of
those
books
took
possession
of
benjamin
mind
and
he
made
it
known
to
the
bookseller
a
new
idea
has
struck
me
wilcox
i
do
not
want
to
take
so
much
advantage
of
your
generosity
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
i
can
pay
you
a
sum
we
can
agree
upon
to
take
out
and
read
such
books
as
i
may
select
i
mean
pay
you
a
given
amount
on
each
book
i
read
i
had
not
thought
of
that
it
is
an
excellent
plan
i
think
we
will
have
no
difficulty
about
the
price
answered
wilcox
it
will
take
me
longer
of
course
to
read
some
books
than
it
will
others
continued
benjamin
but
i
am
a
rapid
reader
and
shall
be
as
expeditious
as
possible
with
each
volume
and
also
i
pledge
myself
that
each
volume
shall
be
returned
in
as
good
a
condition
as
when
i
take
it
out
that
is
fair
i
accept
the
proposition
the
price
per
volume
was
agreed
upon
and
benjamin
reveled
in
books
every
night
he
never
advanced
more
rapidly
in
intellectual
attainments
than
he
did
after
this
arrangement
with
wilcox
this
is
the
first
instance
of
loaning
books
for
a
price
on
record
a
practice
that
has
become
universal
since
that
day
he
had
not
been
at
palmer
long
before
he
was
employed
in
composing
for
the
second
edition
of
wollaston
religion
of
nature
which
was
just
the
kind
of
a
treatise
to
arouse
his
intellect
and
to
set
him
to
thinking
and
also
to
speculating
poor
reasoning
he
said
to
watts
very
fallacious
and
superficial
too
ah
replied
watts
considerably
surprised
that
his
new
employee
just
over
from
a
new
and
uncultivated
country
should
handle
a
treatise
like
that
so
gingerly
how
is
that
rather
a
popular
work
that
of
wollaston
popular
enough
it
may
be
but
error
is
often
popular
the
work
is
illogical
and
not
altogether
in
harmony
with
facts
criticisms
impressed
watts
somewhat
though
he
thought
he
was
laboring
under
a
mistake
perhaps
the
trouble
is
in
your
own
mind
and
not
in
wollaston
he
suggested
that
may
be
but
i
am
going
to
review
it
for
my
own
satisfaction
and
benefit
answered
benjamin
then
i
will
suspend
judgment
until
i
can
read
your
review
said
watts
at
the
same
time
being
still
more
surprised
that
a
youth
of
his
age
should
be
so
familiar
with
such
topics
within
a
short
time
benjamin
had
his
review
of
religion
of
nature
prepared
and
printed
bearing
the
somewhat
dignified
title
a
dissertation
on
liberty
and
necessity
pleasure
and
pain
and
it
was
inscribed
to
his
friend
james
ralph
a
copy
was
submitted
to
watts
for
examination
and
his
opinion
awaited
with
some
anxiety
i
confess
that
it
is
a
remarkable
production
for
a
youth
like
you
to
father
remarkable
in
its
plan
thought
and
reasoning
but
it
is
no
credit
to
your
principles
watts
said
how
so
it
is
really
deistical
in
its
position
you
remember
that
i
suggested
the
trouble
might
be
in
yourself
instead
of
wollaston
and
it
is
in
my
judgment
wherein
is
my
reasoning
illogical
or
incorrect
benjamin
use
of
the
socratic
method
of
reasoning
still
adhered
to
him
any
reasoning
is
illogical
and
fallacious
that
takes
it
for
granted
that
there
is
no
god
answered
watts
without
a
god
we
are
nowhere
and
that
is
where
your
pamphlet
is
there
is
ingenuity
in
it
i
grant
but
it
is
false
from
your
standpoint
you
mean
mr
watts
yes
if
you
please
but
my
standpoint
is
the
bible
any
reasoning
that
ignores
the
bible
is
fallacious
to
pretend
to
understand
the
things
of
this
world
without
a
god
is
abominable
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
well
you
are
getting
rather
personal
benjamin
answered
roguishly
i
suspect
that
you
are
rather
puritanical
in
your
notions
but
i
am
not
no
that
is
quite
evident
nothing
puritanical
about
your
dissertation
but
a
plenty
that
is
fanatical
retorted
watts
much
obliged
for
your
opinion
so
frankly
expressed
added
benjamin
as
watts
turned
to
answer
a
call
a
short
time
after
the
publication
of
the
foregoing
dissertation
a
london
surgeon
by
the
name
of
lyons
called
at
watts
office
is
there
a
man
at
work
in
your
printing
house
by
the
name
of
franklin
benjamin
franklin
he
inquired
of
watts
there
is
can
i
see
him
yes
i
will
call
him
benjamin
was
called
and
introduced
to
the
gentleman
who
said
holding
a
pamphlet
in
his
hand
are
you
the
author
of
this
on
liberty
and
necessity
pleasure
and
pain
i
am
sir
benjamin
had
received
such
a
trimming
from
his
employer
that
he
was
almost
sure
the
stranger
had
come
to
stigmatize
him
for
writing
that
pamphlet
but
he
was
soon
relieved
by
the
remark
of
lyons
i
have
read
it
with
great
interest
and
have
been
very
much
profited
by
it
i
did
not
dream
however
that
it
was
written
by
so
young
a
person
as
you
are
benjamin
thanked
him
for
his
complimentary
words
and
the
surgeon
went
on
i
am
the
author
of
the
book
entitled
infallibility
of
human
judgment
and
i
think
our
views
harmonize
in
the
main
i
should
be
pleased
to
loan
you
a
copy
if
you
care
to
read
it
it
will
afford
me
real
pleasure
to
read
it
doctor
lyons
and
i
shall
appreciate
your
favor
and
when
you
have
read
it
i
shall
be
glad
to
meet
you
and
compare
notes
and
discuss
the
topics
nothing
will
suit
me
better
than
that
added
benjamin
doctor
lyons
frequently
called
on
benjamin
to
converse
upon
the
of
his
pamphlet
and
at
one
time
he
says
he
carried
me
to
the
horns
a
house
in
lane
cheapside
and
introduced
me
to
doctor
mandeville
author
of
the
of
the
bees
who
had
a
club
there
of
which
he
was
the
soul
being
a
most
facetious
entertaining
companion
the
religion
in
benjamin
pamphlet
and
that
in
lyons
book
was
well
suited
to
a
house
it
was
so
as
scarcely
to
be
discernible
in
either
book
or
pamphlet
almost
entirely
faded
out
that
was
why
benjamin
pamphlet
pleased
lyons
so
much
the
religion
in
it
was
not
too
much
for
a
house
doctor
lyons
introduced
him
also
to
one
doctor
pemberton
at
batson
a
kindred
spirit
whose
coffee
was
stronger
than
his
religion
a
lively
sort
of
a
man
he
was
very
familiar
with
benjamin
glad
to
know
that
your
mind
is
interested
in
subjects
of
so
grave
importance
he
said
in
a
youth
of
your
age
it
is
evidence
of
a
strong
mind
and
expanding
intellect
most
of
my
friends
do
not
regard
my
views
with
the
favor
you
express
they
see
evidence
rather
of
mental
weakness
and
distortion
said
benjamin
in
reply
it
is
because
they
do
not
investigate
for
themselves
they
are
content
to
receive
opinions
secondhand
labelled
and
fixed
how
would
you
like
to
number
sir
isaac
newton
among
your
friends
doctor
pemberton
spoke
as
a
man
of
authority
i
should
feel
myself
highly
honored
answered
benjamin
do
you
know
him
i
have
the
honor
of
his
acquaintance
and
i
will
give
you
an
introduction
at
some
future
time
i
shall
accept
your
favor
with
thanks
and
benjamin
waited
and
waited
for
the
opportunity
but
it
never
came
probably
because
newton
could
never
be
found
in
an
this
was
the
outcome
of
benjamin
literary
venture
and
the
pleasantest
part
of
the
whole
was
that
he
lived
to
see
the
folly
of
his
effort
especially
its
character
he
became
satisfied
that
watts
was
right
when
he
declared
the
principles
of
his
dissertation
abominable
at
another
time
while
benjamin
worked
at
watts
sir
hans
sloane
called
upon
him
another
notable
london
character
of
that
day
benjamin
was
taken
aback
when
he
met
him
he
could
scarcely
divine
what
this
titled
englishman
could
want
of
him
i
have
heard
of
you
franklin
as
recently
from
america
and
i
have
called
to
make
your
acquaintance
he
said
glad
to
meet
you
sir
hans
replied
benjamin
fully
equal
to
the
occasion
i
am
at
your
service
you
are
the
author
of
a
pamphlet
called
and
he
gave
the
title
are
you
i
am
i
have
not
read
it
but
i
have
heard
it
discussed
and
i
concluded
that
a
youth
of
your
age
must
possess
a
strong
mind
to
undertake
such
a
treatise
and
i
understand
that
you
brought
many
curiosities
with
you
to
this
country
now
sir
hans
was
getting
to
the
subject
that
was
near
to
his
heart
for
he
was
a
a
few
only
very
few
replied
benjamin
you
have
a
purse
i
understand
made
of
the
which
purifies
by
fire
yes
sir
i
have
i
should
be
delighted
to
have
you
call
upon
me
in
bloomsbury
square
and
bring
the
purse
and
i
will
show
you
great
collection
of
curiosities
i
think
you
can
spend
a
pleasant
and
profitable
evening
in
that
way
i
will
do
it
with
the
greatest
pleasure
and
be
obliged
for
the
opportunity
benjamin
answered
and
he
did
the
first
opportunity
he
improved
to
take
the
asbestos
purse
to
bloomsbury
square
where
he
had
a
splendid
time
examining
the
best
collection
of
curiosities
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
and
where
he
discussed
various
topics
of
interest
with
the
entertaining
sir
hans
now
said
the
host
as
benjamin
was
about
to
leave
i
should
be
glad
to
add
the
asbestos
purse
to
my
collection
and
i
will
pay
you
well
for
it
naming
the
amount
i
will
accommodate
you
and
leave
it
benjamin
was
happy
to
add
to
sir
hans
collection
in
the
circumstances
benjamin
felt
the
need
of
more
physical
exercise
so
that
when
he
entered
the
printing
house
he
took
to
working
at
press
he
drank
water
only
all
other
employees
about
fifty
of
them
drank
strong
beer
he
was
really
a
curiosity
to
them
is
a
detestable
habit
he
said
to
a
and
it
is
a
very
expensive
one
too
for
a
poor
fellow
like
you
i
could
not
do
a
decent
day
work
without
beer
i
drink
it
for
strength
so
much
the
worse
for
you
beer
strength
is
the
worst
sort
of
weakness
continued
benjamin
just
stop
a
moment
and
think
what
a
you
make
of
yourself
a
pint
before
breakfast
a
pint
at
breakfast
a
pint
between
breakfast
and
dinner
a
pint
at
dinner
a
pint
in
the
afternoon
a
pint
at
six
and
a
pint
when
you
have
done
work
almost
a
gallon
each
day
why
i
could
not
hold
half
as
much
as
that
i
should
run
over
then
you
do
believe
a
man
can
do
more
work
for
drinking
strong
beer
of
course
i
do
i
can
do
more
work
than
any
man
in
the
establishment
and
i
can
lift
more
than
any
other
man
here
and
i
drink
nothing
but
water
if
beer
imparts
the
strength
you
imagine
any
one
of
you
ought
to
do
more
work
and
lift
more
than
i
can
is
that
so
the
workmen
had
good
reason
to
believe
this
for
benjamin
had
kept
his
eyes
and
ears
open
from
the
time
he
entered
the
printing
house
and
he
had
learned
just
what
the
men
thought
about
beer
why
they
drank
it
how
much
work
they
did
and
how
much
they
could
lift
without
saying
a
word
about
it
he
took
special
pains
to
turn
off
a
large
amount
of
work
and
to
lift
more
than
his
for
example
he
would
carry
two
forms
of
type
one
in
each
hand
up
and
down
stairs
while
the
other
workmen
carried
but
one
with
both
hands
therefore
watts
the
name
of
the
workman
knew
that
every
thing
benjamin
claimed
about
strength
was
true
are
all
americans
like
you
inquired
the
workman
no
too
many
of
them
are
like
you
i
am
sorry
to
say
they
drink
beer
and
other
intoxicants
that
disqualify
them
for
business
if
more
of
them
would
drink
water
as
i
do
they
would
be
far
better
off
physically
and
pecuniarily
some
of
our
best
doctors
claim
that
there
is
much
nutriment
in
beer
he
suggested
and
every
one
of
them
knows
that
there
is
more
nutriment
in
a
pennyworth
of
bread
than
there
is
in
a
whole
gallon
of
beer
therefore
if
you
eat
the
bread
and
drink
the
water
you
get
more
strength
the
printer
acknowledged
that
there
was
something
in
that
you
see
continued
benjamin
that
all
the
nutriment
there
is
in
the
barley
is
destroyed
to
convert
it
into
beer
your
beer
is
very
dirty
water
made
bitter
with
malt
out
of
which
nearly
every
particle
of
nutriment
has
been
squeezed
there
is
as
much
nourishment
in
dishwater
as
there
is
in
that
stuff
here
jake
where
are
you
called
out
another
workman
bring
on
the
beer
jake
was
the
whose
business
it
was
to
supply
the
men
with
beer
from
the
another
nuisance
required
by
your
beer
business
exclaimed
benjamin
better
by
far
pay
a
boy
double
price
to
bring
water
from
the
well
instead
of
bringing
that
stuff
to
absorb
your
money
and
sodden
your
brain
a
indeed
said
watts
who
heard
much
of
the
conversation
but
will
you
not
allow
some
comfort
to
men
certainly
that
is
what
i
am
after
there
is
more
comfort
in
one
glass
of
pure
water
than
there
is
in
a
whole
barrel
of
beer
here
is
watts
paying
out
four
or
five
shillings
every
week
for
beer
when
water
would
cost
him
nothing
and
he
would
have
that
amount
to
spend
for
genuine
comforts
besides
beer
unfits
him
to
get
real
comfort
out
of
any
thing
even
out
of
his
home
you
are
about
right
on
that
replied
watts
beer
does
make
a
class
of
men
most
miserable
but
must
i
discard
it
because
some
men
use
it
to
their
injury
of
course
you
must
benjamin
answered
quickly
and
triumphantly
there
is
where
duty
and
right
come
in
the
strong
must
bear
the
infirmities
of
the
weak
or
they
wo
amount
to
much
in
the
world
many
of
them
wo
amount
to
much
any
way
beer
or
no
beer
responded
watts
any
of
them
will
amount
to
more
with
water
than
they
will
with
beer
retorted
benjamin
who
felt
competent
to
support
his
side
of
the
question
he
went
on
look
here
i
am
supplied
with
a
large
porringer
of
gruel
sprinkled
with
pepper
crumbled
with
bread
and
a
bit
of
butter
in
it
for
just
the
price
of
a
pint
of
beer
three
now
honestly
is
not
this
much
better
for
me
or
for
yourself
than
the
same
amount
of
filthy
beer
possibly
it
is
a
new
view
of
the
case
to
me
was
all
that
watts
could
say
evidently
conceding
that
benjamin
was
about
right
benjamin
exchanged
the
for
the
after
a
few
weeks
a
treat
now
ben
that
is
the
condition
of
admission
here
said
the
men
i
guess
not
i
fulfilled
that
condition
in
the
answered
benjamin
once
will
do
in
this
establishment
but
you
retorted
a
enforced
by
a
dozen
voices
the
rule
is
irrevocable
we
will
see
about
that
replied
benjamin
with
coolness
but
determination
yes
we
see
chimed
in
a
resolute
voice
and
after
all
your
seeing
and
blustering
i
shall
not
do
it
added
benjamin
in
a
tone
that
indicated
he
meant
what
he
said
ben
is
right
interrupted
watts
who
had
listened
to
the
colloquy
he
has
met
that
condition
once
in
the
and
he
will
not
be
required
to
repeat
it
i
forbid
his
doing
it
it
is
a
very
foolish
custom
any
way
said
benjamin
and
the
sooner
it
is
abandoned
in
england
or
anywhere
else
the
better
after
all
he
did
not
carry
his
point
his
own
words
about
the
affair
were
as
follows
i
stood
out
two
or
three
weeks
was
accordingly
considered
as
an
excommunicate
and
had
so
many
little
pieces
of
private
malice
practised
on
me
by
mixing
my
sorts
transposing
and
breaking
my
matter
if
ever
i
stepped
out
of
the
room
and
all
ascribed
to
the
which
they
said
ever
haunted
those
not
regularly
admitted
that
notwithstanding
the
master
protection
i
found
myself
obliged
to
comply
and
pay
the
money
convinced
of
the
folly
of
being
on
ill
terms
with
those
one
is
to
live
with
continually
benjamin
kept
up
the
fight
against
until
he
fairly
conquered
one
after
another
yielded
to
his
example
and
arguments
and
abandoned
the
old
habit
of
swilling
down
beer
until
a
thorough
reformation
was
wrought
in
the
printing
office
the
strength
health
tact
and
enterprise
of
the
convinced
them
that
he
was
right
the
title
bandied
about
the
printing
house
came
to
be
really
an
appellation
of
esteem
the
printing
press
on
which
benjamin
worked
at
watts
printing
house
is
now
in
the
patent
office
at
washington
where
many
visitors
go
to
see
it
forty
years
after
he
worked
on
it
franklin
was
in
london
where
his
fame
was
greater
than
that
of
any
other
man
and
he
called
at
the
old
printing
house
and
going
up
to
the
familiar
press
he
said
to
the
employees
it
is
just
forty
years
since
i
worked
at
this
press
as
you
are
working
now
illustration
franklin
london
printing
press
the
announcement
rather
startled
them
that
a
public
man
of
so
much
fame
should
ever
have
even
served
in
a
printing
office
as
they
were
serving
was
almost
too
much
for
them
to
believe
the
publisher
of
this
volume
has
in
his
possession
letters
from
different
gentlemen
in
england
fully
verifying
the
press

engraving
of
which

at

again
we
have
seen
that
james
ralph
and
benjamin
parted
company
ralph
had
more
brains
than
heart
his
intellectual
powers
were
greater
than
his
principles
the
reader
may
ask
what
became
of
him
after
continuing
poor
and
unsuccessful
engaging
in
several
literary
ventures
that
did
little
more
than
aggravate
his
poverty
and
changing
from
one
kind
of
work
to
another
good
fortune
seemed
to
become

portion

his
works
may
be
examined
by
the
curious
in
the
library
of
harvard
university
and
in
the
philadelphia
city
library
in
estimating
the
career
of
this
erring
man
we
should
not
forget
that
many
of
the
noblemen
and
statesmen
with
whom
he
associated
and
for
whose
advancement
he
toiled
had
less
principle
than
he
and
had
not
his
excuse
swimming
is
one
of
the
fine
arts
i
think
said
benjamin
to
wygate
a
printer
with
whom
he
was
on
the
most
intimate
terms
i
feel
about
as
much
at
home
in
the
water
as
i
do
on
the
land
well
i
should
go
to
the
bottom
pretty
quick
if
i
should
venture
where
the
water
is
over
my
head
for
i
ca
swim
any
more
than
this
can
answered
wygate
why
do
you
learn
it
might
be
of
great
use
to
you
sometime
i
should
like
to
know
how
but
i
never
tried
to
learn
and
that
is
a
good
reason
for
not
knowing
how
to
swim
you
expect
to
know
any
thing
without
learning
i
can
teach
you
without
any
trouble
i
accept
your
offer
and
will
try
my
best
to
learn
and
hall
will
try
with
me
i
think
you
can
teach
two
as
well
as
one
ca
you
yes
a
dozen
so
far
as
that
goes
the
more
the
merrier
when
will
you
go
just
when
you
please
you
and
hall
fix
the
time
and
i
will
be
on
hand
the
result
was
that
benjamin
was
in
the
water
with
his
two
pupils
within
a
few
days
and
he
taught
both
of
them
to
swim
well
in
two
lessons
at
the
same
time
he
gave
them
an
exhibition
of
what
an
expert
swimmer
can
do
in
the
water
performing
different
feats
on
and
under
the
water
that
filled
his
two
companions
with
surprise
you
are
a
in
more
senses
than
one
remarked
wygate
in
admiration
of
benjamin
pranks
in
the
water
you
could
live
in
the
water
about
as
well
as
on
the
land
that
is
not
strange
responded
hall
he
believes
in
water
inside
and
outside
he
only
practises
what
he
preaches
and
that
is
what
he
ought
to
do
some
people
ca
practise
what
they
preach
if
they
try
ever
so
hard
in
business
or
in
morals
rejoined
wygate
wygate
was
the
son
of
a
wealthy
man
who
educated
him
quite
thoroughly
he
could
read
latin
and
french
about
as
well
as
he
could
english
and
he
could
write
very
entertaining
articles
he
was
fond
of
reading
too
and
loved
to
discuss
important
questions
such
a
young
man
was
not
often
found
in
a
printing
office
and
he
just
suited
benjamin
in
his
literary
tastes
so
that
they
became
boon
companions
their
mutual
attachment
was
strengthened
by
this
experience
in
the
art
of
swimming
not
long
after
wygate
learned
to
swim
and
while
the
feats
that
benjamin
performed
in
the
water
were
still
a
subject
of
remark
some
gentlemen
proposed
an
excursion
by
water
to
chelsea
several
miles
from
london
would
you
like
to
go
ben
of
course
i
would
if
you
are
going
i
will
go
if
you
go
i
will
call
round
with
some
of
the
party
and
introduce
you
to
them
this
was
done
in
due
time
and
benjamin
learned
from
them
that
they
were
going
to
chelsea
to
see
the
college
and
don
curiosities
which
object
of
the
excursion
more
than
doubled
his
interest
on
the
trip
wygate
talked
much
with
some
of
the
party
about
feats
in
the
water
as
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
believed
on
returning
one
of
the
gentlemen
said
franklin
why
can
you
not
give
us
an
exhibition
of
your
antics
in
the
water
yes
ben
do
let
them
see
that
what
i
have
told
them
is
literally
true
entreated
wygate
come
ben
do
it
added
hall
it
will
put
saltero
curiosities
into
the
shade
these
gentlemen
will
be
so
interested
in
your
performances
that
they
will
forget
all
other
curiosities
well
i
am
always
ready
to
accommodate
replied
benjamin
and
it
will
not
cross
my
disposition
to
have
a
little
frolic
in
the
water
so
i
will
consent
so
saying
he
took
off
his
clothing
and
leaped
into
the
river
and
was
soon
as
much
at
home
there
as
a
sometimes
he
was
under
the
water
and
sometimes
on
it
it
did
not
seem
to
make
much
difference
to
him
which
he
swam
from
chelsea
to
blackfriars
four
miles
entertaining
the
company
with
many
manoeuvres
all
the
way
then
he
got
on
board
arrayed
himself
in
his
apparel
to
hear
such
words
of
praise
as
these
wonderful
i
had
no
idea
that
any
man
could
attain
to
such
skill
in
the
water
no
one
in
london
who
can
do
that
nor
in
all
england
and
wales
could
drown
you
franklin
if
you
were
left
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
ocean
you
could
make
a
fortune
if
you
chose
to
exhibit
your
skill
as
this
brief
experience
together
with
his
teaching
wygate
and
hall
to
swim
won
him
quite
a
reputation
on
this
line
we
may
state
here
that
after
benjamin
had
decided
to
return
to
philadelphia
and
arranged
therefor
he
received
a
note
from
sir
william
wyndham
a
noted
public
man
who
was
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
in
the
bolingbroke
administration
inviting
him
to
pay
him
a
visit
benjamin
was
again
perplexed
to
know
what
this
great
man
could
want
of
him
but
he
went
to
see
him
i
am
happy
to
see
you
franklin
and
i
hope
it
has
been
no
inconvenience
to
you
to
call
at
this
time
none
at
all
answered
benjamin
on
the
other
hand
i
consider
myself
highly
honored
by
your
invitation
to
call
and
i
have
gladly
embraced
the
first
opportunity
to
do
so
i
have
heard
of
your
great
skill
in
the
art
of
swimming
continued
sir
wyndham
and
how
quickly
you
taught
two
young
printers
to
swim
yes
modestly
answered
benjamin
i
have
some
skill
in
the
water
and
i
did
teach
two
of
my
companions
the
art
of
swimming
so
that
they
are
excellent
swimmers
now
that
is
what
i
heard
and
i
have
two
sons
who
are
soon
to
start
upon
extensive
travels
and
i
want
they
should
learn
to
swim
before
they
go
it
may
be
of
great
service
to
them
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
prove
a
benefit
to
them
responded
benjamin
i
should
not
want
to
part
with
my
skill
for
any
consideration
whatever
can
you
teach
my
two
sons
the
art
at
once
i
regret
to
say
that
i
can
not
for
the
reason
that
i
am
soon
to
leave
london
and
return
to
america
sorry
for
that
very
sorry
indeed
allow
me
to
suggest
that
if
you
could
prolong
your
stay
here
you
might
make
a
real
pecuniary
success
of
establishing
a
swimming
school
i
should
be
willing
to
pay
almost
any
price
for
the
instruction
of
my
two
sons
sir
wyndham
was
very
earnest
in
his
counsel
and
made
this
suggestion
sincerely
i
really
feel
under
great
obligations
for
your
interest
and
good
opinions
benjamin
answered
but
i
have
already
accepted
an
invitation
to
engage
in
business
in
philadelphia
my
home
and
may
leave
within
a
few
days
that
settles
the
matter
of
course
but
i
am
sorry
that
it
is
so
added
sir
wyndham
i
trust
that
you
may
prosper
wherever
you
are
benjamin
thanked
him
heartily
for
his
complimentary
words
and
good
wishes
and
left
him
almost
wishing
that
he
could
cancel
his
engagement
with
denham
and
open
a
swimming
school
wygate
and
hall
assured
him
that
he
could
do
well
in
that
business
soon
after
the
excursion
to
chelsea
wygate
made
known
to
benjamin
a
scheme
that
was
in
his
mind
i
want
to
travel
extensively
over
europe
he
said
and
i
have
decided
to
do
it
if
you
will
become
my
traveling
companion
we
can
stop
as
necessity
requires
from
time
to
time
and
work
at
our
business
so
as
to
pay
our
way
i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
travel
all
over
europe
answered
benjamin
i
have
a
desire
to
see
more
than
i
have
seen
of
this
part
of
the
world
well
what
do
you
think
of
the
plan
i
should
say
that
it
is
practicable
although
the
suggestion
is
entirely
new
to
me
could
we
get
work
at
our
business
i
took
it
for
granted
that
we
could
replied
wygate
i
have
no
more
means
of
knowing
than
you
have
i
should
take
it
for
granted
that
we
could
too
said
benjamin
still
i
shall
want
to
consider
it
it
is
quite
an
enterprise
to
undertake
somewhat
of
a
scheme
but
a
very
interesting
and
instructive
one
if
successfully
prosecuted
that
is
so
and
i
think
favorably
of
it
i
will
consult
my
good
friend
denham
about
it
he
has
seen
more
of
the
world
than
we
have
benjamin
was
evidently
favorably
impressed
with
the
proposition
for
he
embraced
the
first
opportunity
to
lay
the
subject
before
denham
it
does
not
strike
me
favorably
said
denham
we
could
both
see
and
learn
a
great
deal
remarked
benjamin
that
is
true
but
other
things
are
to
be
considered
which
are
of
equal
importance
what
might
do
for
wygate
whose
home
is
here
might
not
do
for
you
whose
home
is
in
america
that
may
be
benjamin
brief
reply
indicated
that
he
was
not
quite
certain
on
that
point
it
appears
to
me
continued
denham
that
your
first
thoughts
should
be
concerned
about
returning
to
philadelphia
that
you
may
set
up
business
for
yourself
there
i
do
not
see
much
prospect
of
that
at
present
of
course
i
should
be
glad
to
return
home
for
there
is
no
place
i
prefer
to
philadelphia
so
far
as
prospects
of
which
you
speak
are
concerned
we
can
not
always
judge
unexpected
opportunities
sometimes
offer
and
you
do
not
want
to
put
yourself
where
you
can
not
accept
and
use
them
of
course
not
benjamin
answered
evidently
disappointed
that
his
friend
did
not
endorse
the
scheme
i
should
recommend
decidedly
that
you
abandon
the
project
entirely
and
think
no
more
about
it
then
you
can
continue
your
work
with
the
intention
of
returning
to
america
whenever
a
favorable
opportunity
occurs
benjamin
accepted
the
advice
of
denham
and
reported
to
wygate
to
the
no
small
disappointment
of
the
latter
and
both
discarded
the
scheme
and
devoted
themselves
to
honest
labor
benjamin
heard
of
a
place
where
he
could
get
boarded
at
two
shillings
a
week
when
he
was
paying
three
shillings
and
sixpence
a
week
in
duke
street
i
think
i
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
changing
he
said
to
the
widow
with
whom
he
was
boarding
i
want
to
save
all
the
money
i
can
so
as
to
return
to
america
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
have
you
leave
franklin
if
i
can
possibly
arrange
with
you
to
remain
i
have
no
desire
to
leave
except
to
save
a
little
in
my
expenses
that
i
may
return
to
america
sooner
that
is
all
rather
than
have
you
go
i
will
deduct
two
shillings
a
week
from
what
you
are
paying
me
now
that
is
you
propose
to
board
me
for
one
shilling
and
sixpence
a
week
yes
that
is
it
and
it
is
a
bargain
if
you
say
so
it
is
a
bargain
then
and
benjamin
continued
to
board
there
as
long
as
he
remained
in
london
before
this
woman
received
him
for
a
boarder
in
the
first
place
she
sent
to
the
printing
house
to
inquire
about
his
character
the
report
was
so
favorable
that
she
took
him
to
board
and
now
she
had
tried
him
and
was
a
greater
admirer
of
his
character
than
ever
it
is
one
of
the
things
to
be
said
in
benjamin
favor
that
with
all
his
faults
he
always
pleased
and
satisfied
his
employers
and
keepers
benjamin
records
the
following
interesting
incident
respecting
his
friend
denham
of
whom
we
have
spoken
and
to
whom
we
shall
refer
again
i
must
record
one
trait
of
this
good
man
character
he
had
formerly
been
in
business
at
bristol
but
failed
in
debt
to
a
number
of
people
compounded
and
went
to
america
there
by
a
close
application
to
business
as
a
merchant
he
acquired
a
plentiful
fortune
in
a
few
years
returning
to
england
in
the
ship
with
me
he
invited
his
old
creditors
to
an
entertainment
at
which
he
thanked
them
for
the
easy
composition
they
had
favored
him
with
and
when
they
expected
nothing
but
the
treat
every
man
at
the
first
remove
found
under
his
plate
an
order
on
a
banker
for
the
full
amount
of
the
unpaid
remainder
with
interest
it
was
this
excellent
man
and
friend
who
finally
approached
benjamin
with
a
proposition
how
would
you
like
to
return
to
philadelphia
he
said
to
benjamin
i
should
like
nothing
better
if
the
way
was
open
for
me
to
go
i
will
open
a
way
for
you
if
you
will
go
how
i
am
going
myself
i
intend
to
open
a
store
of
goods
in
philadelphia
and
will
employ
you
in
the
business
if
you
will
go
i
should
like
to
go
but
that
will
be
a
new
business
for
me
perhaps
i
shall
not
succeed
in
it
that
is
lookout
i
think
you
will
succeed
at
any
rate
i
am
prepared
to
take
the
risk
and
i
am
prepared
to
go
if
you
will
benjamin
was
really
delighted
with
the
proposition
i
will
pay
you
fifty
pounds
for
one
year
and
increase
your
wages
thereafter
as
you
become
familiar
with
the
business
that
offer
is
satisfactory
though
it
is
not
as
much
as
i
make
at
my
trade
now
it
will
be
better
if
you
succeed
when
you
become
well
acquainted
with
the
business
i
will
send
you
with
a
cargo
of
bread
and
flour
to
the
west
indies
and
i
will
procure
you
commissions
from
others
that
will
be
profitable
in
this
way
you
can
establish
a
good
business
for
yourself
that
is
a
very
generous
offer
on
your
part
and
i
hope
that
i
shall
merit
your
kindness
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
close
up
your
business
at
the
printing
house
at
once
as
i
want
you
to
assist
me
in
purchasing
packing
and
shipping
goods
my
purpose
is
to
carry
a
large
stock
to
philadelphia
i
shall
accept
your
proposition
and
resign
my
position
at
immediately
and
be
at
your
service
early
and
late
benjamin
no
doubt
was
more
interested
to
return
to
america
on
account
of
his
relation
to
miss
deborah
read
he
had
written
to
her
but
once
and
that
was
directly
after
he
began
work
at
printing
house
he
told
her
of
keith
fraud
practised
upon
him
leaving
him
in
london
a
stranger
and
nearly
penniless
so
that
he
could
not
return
until
he
had
earned
money
enough
to
pay
his
passage
he
did
not
write
to
her
again
and
his
conscience
had
condemned
him
so
that
at
times
he
dwelt
sadly
upon
his
unfaithfulness
he
neglected
to
write
for
so
long
a
time
that
he
became
ashamed
to
write
at
all
and
so
the
correspondence
dropped
yet
he
did
not
forget
miss
read
nor
cast
her
off
and
he
blamed
himself
every
time
his
thoughts
dwelt
upon
his
sin
of
omission
benjamin
employer
was
very
sorry
to
part
with
him
i
am
glad
to
have
you
as
long
as
i
have
he
said
but
i
wish
you
would
stay
i
feel
safe
to
commit
work
or
business
to
your
care
if
ever
i
can
do
you
a
favor
let
me
know
and
i
will
only
be
too
glad
to
do
it
i
thank
you
for
your
confidence
i
have
done
the
best
for
you
i
could
as
i
always
mean
to
do
for
every
employer
i
regret
to
leave
you
and
my
companions
with
whom
i
have
spent
so
many
hours
but
i
have
a
strong
desire
to
return
home
benjamin
spoke
with
considerable
feeling
that
is
an
honorable
desire
answered
watts
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
be
prospered
in
gratifying
it
at
any
rate
i
hope
you
will
so
benjamin
separated
from
his
old
friends
on
the
best
of
terms
and
commenced
work
for
denham
nor
was
it
light
work
he
accompanied
his
employer
from
warehouse
to
warehouse
packing
goods
that
he
bought
and
forwarding
them
to
the
ship
which
would
sail
on
july
it
was
new
business
for
him
but
he
liked
it
all
the
more
for
its
novelty
and
he
performed
the
labors
with
his
accustomed
tact
and
industry
benjamin
had
been
nineteen
months
in
london
when
he
sailed
on
the
of
july
a
few
months
before
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
peter
collinson
a
young
man
of
noble
english
birth
whose
talents
gave
him
nearly
as
much
standing
as
his
ancestry
collinson
heard
of
benjamin
and
sought
him
out
forming
a
friendship
collinson
accompanied
benjamin
to
the
ship
just
before
the
vessel
weighed
anchor
he
handed
his
to
benjamin
saying
let
us
exchange
benjamin
exchanged
replying
and
let
it
be
a
pledge
of
friendship
forever
and
a
pledge
also
of
faithful
correspondence
with
each
other
added
collinson
as
they
shook
hands
and
parted
the
henry
clark
master
was
days
on
its
voyage
to
philadelphia
benjamin
landed
there
on
the
day
of
october
and
he
was
at
home
again
life
and
times
of
benjamin
franklin
vol
xxix
ups
and
downs
of
life
one
of
the
first
places
that
benjamin
visited
was
the
printing
house
of
keimer
where
he
worked
before
leaving
the
country
keimer
had
made
up
his
mind
that
benjamin
would
never
return
to
america
so
that
when
he
entered
the
printing
office
he
was
startled
why
ben
can
it
be
you
he
exclaimed
in
wonder
i
began
to
think
that
you
would
never
be
seen
in
philadelphia
again
why
did
you
think
so
because
you
planned
to
be
back
here
a
long
time
ago
i
concluded
that
you
had
forsaken
us
not
yet
i
have
seen
no
place
abroad
quite
equal
to
philadelphia
i
did
not
return
as
soon
as
i
expected
and
benjamin
rehearsed
to
keimer
substantially
his
experience
with
governor
keith
that
he
might
understand
why
his
return
was
delayed
that
is
what
you
got
for
concealing
your
purpose
said
keimer
i
could
have
told
you
that
keith
was
wholly
unreliable
and
so
could
a
good
many
other
people
he
has
been
turned
out
of
office
because
of
his
rascality
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
i
am
a
little
curious
to
see
how
he
will
act
and
hear
what
he
will
say
when
i
meet
him
he
wo
meet
you
if
he
can
help
it
i
see
him
occasionally
on
the
street
and
he
looks
crestfallen
he
will
look
more
so
i
imagine
when
he
meets
me
i
propose
to
talk
matters
over
very
plainly
with
him
that
can
do
no
good
the
less
breath
you
waste
in
that
way
the
better
for
you
replied
keimer
but
i
suppose
you
want
to
go
to
work
at
your
old
trade
plenty
of
work
here
and
you
are
just
the
man
to
do
it
keimer
business
had
increased
largely
and
he
had
added
many
facilities
for
doing
work
so
that
the
establishment
presented
a
more
attractive
appearance
no
i
am
a
printer
no
longer
answered
benjamin
i
am
booked
for
the
mercantile
business
in
philadelphia
how
is
that
were
you
not
a
printer
in
london
yes
i
followed
my
trade
there
and
learned
more
about
it
than
i
ever
knew
before
london
is
a
great
place
for
printing
two
printing
houses
there
with
more
than
fifty
hands
in
each
think
you
can
do
better
in
trading
than
printing
asked
keimer
who
was
really
anxious
for
benjamin
services
not
exactly
so
but
i
should
be
in
london
now
had
not
offer
to
become
his
clerk
brought
me
home
and
benjamin
told
the
story
of
his
acquaintance
with
denham
and
the
outcome
which
was
his
offer
to
make
him
his
business
manager
a
good
opportunity
i
should
think
if
you
like
that
business
answered
keimer
but
i
should
like
to
put
you
in
manager
of
my
printing
office
you
have
had
the
experience
and
understand
the
business
much
better
than
any
man
i
have
that
is
out
of
the
question
now
of
course
as
i
am
under
obligations
to
mr
denham
of
course
i
only
meant
to
tell
you
what
i
would
do
if
you
were
at
liberty
benjamin
was
anxious
to
learn
about
miss
read
whom
he
was
quite
ashamed
to
meet
because
of
his
neglect
keimer
was
acquainted
with
the
family
and
first
introduced
him
to
them
as
was
stated
in
a
former
chapter
so
that
he
had
no
doubt
he
would
know
all
about
deborah
he
ventured
to
inquire
what
can
you
tell
me
about
read
and
her
daughter
read
lives
where
she
did
and
continues
to
take
a
few
boarders
her
daughter
was
married
to
a
miserable
fellow
nearly
a
year
ago
but
lived
with
him
only
a
few
weeks
when
she
left
him
indeed
that
was
unfortunate
for
her
benjamin
answered
she
deserves
a
better
experience
than
that
she
would
not
have
married
had
she
been
left
to
her
own
choice
but
her
mother
and
other
friends
persuaded
her
rogers
was
her
name
and
he
was
a
potter
by
trade
a
workman
and
they
thought
he
was
capable
of
getting
a
good
living
i
suppose
a
good
character
would
have
been
of
more
service
to
him
suggested
benjamin
a
very
unfortunate
affair
i
was
going
to
sway
continued
keimer
that
she
had
been
married
but
a
few
weeks
before
she
found
that
rogers
had
another
wife
of
course
her
marriage
was
not
legal
and
she
left
him
at
once
probably
her
mother
made
no
inquiry
about
rogers
character
beforehand
remarked
benjamin
mothers
ought
to
be
wiser
than
that
we
all
have
to
live
and
learn
and
experience
is
our
best
schoolmaster
added
keimer
keimer
knew
nothing
of
benjamin
relation
to
deborah
read
so
that
he
spoke
freely
the
revelation
was
startling
to
benjamin
and
it
set
him
to
thinking
he
concluded
that
read
inferred
from
his
first
and
only
letter
to
deborah
that
he
would
never
return
or
never
be
in
a
situation
to
support
a
wife
and
family
and
as
time
went
on
and
no
other
letters
were
received
she
became
fixed
in
her
conclusion
that
he
would
not
return
benjamin
took
all
the
blame
upon
himself
and
the
honest
sympathy
of
his
heart
asserted
itself
for
the
girl
he
resolved
to
call
upon
her
as
soon
as
possible
and
confess
his
ask
her
forgiveness
and
renew
his
attentions
i
should
have
said
keimer
added
that
deborah
has
not
changed
her
name
she
refuses
to
be
called
rogers
and
is
still
called
miss
read
by
her
friends
this
is
all
right
i
suppose
because
her
marriage
was
illegal
very
wise
for
her
i
think
responded
benjamin
but
she
may
consider
herself
fortunate
to
get
released
from
such
a
bondage
he
improved
the
first
opportunity
to
call
at
read
to
whom
he
appeared
as
one
from
the
dead
she
had
not
heard
of
his
arrival
nor
that
he
was
expected
the
weekly
the
only
newspaper
of
the
town
announced
entered
inwards
ship
henry
clark
from
london
that
was
all
nothing
was
said
about
any
passengers
benjamin
franklin
exclaimed
read
in
great
astonishment
throwing
up
her
hands
at
first
as
if
fearing
it
was
his
ghost
and
then
giving
him
a
most
cordial
welcome
can
it
be
you
it
can
be
benjamin
replied
with
his
familiarity
being
reassured
by
read
friendly
appearance
if
i
know
myself
this
is
benjamin
franklin
deborah
made
her
appearance
before
the
last
words
were
fairly
off
the
lips
of
the
new
comer
equally
surprised
and
glad
to
see
her
old
friend
i
am
really
ashamed
to
meet
you
deborah
after
my
inexcusable
neglect
he
said
and
first
of
all
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
it
scarcely
seems
possible
to
myself
that
i
should
treat
you
so
before
deborah
had
time
to
reply
her
mother
spoke
if
there
is
any
blame
to
be
attached
to
any
one
it
is
to
me
for
i
opposed
your
engagement
and
entreated
deborah
to
marry
that
apology
for
a
man
rogers
but
all
that
does
not
excuse
me
for
not
writing
to
deborah
responded
benjamin
it
was
very
wrong
in
me
to
treat
her
with
such
neglect
and
i
did
not
intend
to
do
so
i
meant
to
continue
the
correspondence
but
one
thing
and
another
prevented
for
so
long
a
time
that
i
really
was
ashamed
to
write
well
it
is
all
over
now
and
there
is
no
help
for
what
has
been
done
except
to
learn
a
good
lesson
from
it
for
the
future
if
we
are
all
bright
enough
to
do
that
read
swept
the
deck
by
these
last
remarks
there
was
no
obstacle
now
to
consummate
an
engagement
with
deborah
she
did
not
tell
benjamin
to
go
ahead
and
make
sure
of
his
bird
now
that
she
would
not
interpose
the
slightest
objection
but
she
might
as
well
have
said
so
and
he
so
understood
it
so
that
he
felt
perfectly
at
ease
deborah
read
had
never
lost
her
first
love
and
never
wholly
abandoned
the
idea
that
her
lover
would
return
she
had
no
love
for
rogers
when
she
married
him
she
married
him
to
please
her
mother
now
her
love
for
benjamin
was
as
fresh
and
strong
as
ever
and
so
was
his
love
for
her
their
intimacy
was
renewed
an
engagement
consummated
benjamin
was
twenty
years
old
a
handsome
young
man
denham
thought
so
and
so
did
deborah
read
the
first
was
fortunate
in
securing
him
for
his
clerk
and
the
second
was
equally
fortunate
in
securing
him
for
her
future
husband
and
benjamin
himself
was
as
fortunate
as
either
of
them
in
having
such
an
employer
as
denham
and
such
a
betrothed
as
deborah
it
was
a
tidal
wave
of
good
fortune
now
and
i
am
prepared
to
go
to
work
at
once
i
will
pay
you
extra
wages
to
take
the
whole
charge
of
the
printing
office
so
that
i
can
give
my
attention
to
the
stationer
shop
i
can
do
that
or
any
thing
else
you
desire
am
not
at
all
particular
i
am
now
years
old
and
ought
to
be
a
man
any
way
and
do
the
best
i
can
wherever
i
am
put
keimer
offer
was
liberal
and
benjamin
accepted
it
and
entered
upon
his
work
as
superintendent
of
the
printing
house
a
very
responsible
position
but
in
a
short
time
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
keimer
paid
him
so
liberal
wages
because
he
wanted
the
poor
printers
to
improve
under
his
superintendence
and
when
that
end
was
accomplished
he
would
cut
down
his
wages
or
hire
another
man
for
less
money
however
he
went
to
work
with
a
will
as
he
always
did
resolved
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
his
employer
as
the
workmen
improved
under
benjamin
supervision
keimer
evidently
began
to
think
of
discharging
him
or
cutting
down
his
wages
on
paying
his
second
quarter
wages
he
told
him
that
he
could
not
continue
to
pay
him
so
much
he
became
uncivil
in
his
treatment
frequently
found
fault
with
him
and
plainly
tried
to
make
his
situation
uncomfortable
so
that
he
would
leave
at
length
a
rare
opportunity
offered
for
him
to
make
trouble
an
unusual
noise
in
the
street
one
day
caused
benjamin
to
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
to
learn
what
was
the
matter
keimer
happened
to
be
in
the
street
and
seeing
him
cried
out
put
your
head
in
and
attend
to
your
business
adding
some
reproachful
words
which
all
the
people
around
him
heard
then
hastening
up
stairs
into
the
office
he
continued
his
insulting
language
men
who
work
for
me
must
give
better
heed
to
their
business
if
they
care
more
for
a
noise
in
the
street
than
they
do
for
their
work
it
is
high
time
they
left
i
am
ready
to
leave
any
time
you
please
retorted
benjamin
nettled
by
such
treatment
i
am
not
dependent
on
you
for
a
living
and
i
shall
not
bear
such
treatment
long
i
assure
you
that
indeed
replied
keimer
derisively
you
would
not
stay
another
day
were
it
not
for
our
agreement
in
accordance
with
which
i
now
warn
you
that
at
the
end
of
this
quarter
i
shall
cease
to
employ
you
and
i
will
notify
you
that
i
shall
not
work
another
minute
for
you
a
man
who
is
neither
honest
nor
a
gentleman
does
not
deserve
the
service
of
decent
men
benjamin
was
aroused
and
as
he
spoke
these
last
cutting
words
he
took
his
hat
and
left
as
he
passed
down
he
said
to
meredith
bring
all
my
things
to
my
lodgings
in
the
evening
meredith
carried
all
the
articles
belonging
to
benjamin
to
his
where
he
had
a
long
interview
keimer
lost
the
last
claim
for
respect
that
he
had
on
his
men
said
meredith
not
a
man
in
his
establishment
who
does
not
condemn
his
course
just
what
i
expected
he
does
not
want
to
pay
me
my
price
now
that
the
men
have
learned
their
business
this
was
the
first
occasion
he
has
had
to
drive
me
off
benjamin
spoke
with
the
utmost
coolness
it
is
the
worst
act
for
himself
that
he
has
done
continued
meredith
every
man
he
employs
would
leave
him
if
work
could
be
had
elsewhere
i
think
i
shall
return
to
boston
whether
i
remain
there
or
not
it
is
a
good
time
for
me
to
visit
my
friends
i
have
something
better
than
that
to
suggest
my
thoughts
have
been
busy
on
it
all
day
and
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
it
before
you
laid
any
plans
meredith
manner
indicated
something
of
importance
what
have
you
to
propose
i
am
ready
for
any
practicable
enterprise
you
can
name
i
want
to
set
up
the
printing
business
for
myself
and
i
am
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
it
and
you
are
can
we
not
arrange
to
go
into
business
together
meredith
proposition
took
benjamin
by
surprise
and
evidently
seemed
impracticable
to
him
and
have
poverty
for
our
capital
replied
benjamin
with
a
laugh
i
am
about
as
rich
as
you
are
no
have
money
for
our
capital
all
that
is
necessary
to
start
us
well
in
business
answered
meredith
that
would
be
fine
i
declare
but
i
would
like
to
see
the
money
first
added
benjamin
before
meredith
could
explain
hold
on
a
minute
let
me
explain
and
you
will
see
that
my
plan
is
not
so
impracticable
as
you
seem
to
think
my
father
has
money
and
he
has
always
said
that
he
would
start
me
in
business
whenever
i
got
a
good
knowledge
of
it
he
knows
of
course
that
i
have
not
that
knowledge
yet
but
he
knows
too
that
a
man
who
can
run
establishment
has
the
requisite
knowledge
and
would
be
a
good
partner
for
me
but
your
father
will
never
advance
the
necessary
capital
interrupted
benjamin
if
i
was
ten
years
older
he
might
do
it
i
am
confident
that
he
will
at
any
rate
i
will
consult
him
about
the
matter
and
learn
just
what
he
will
do
i
have
told
him
all
about
you
and
he
will
think
it
is
a
good
opportunity
for
me
meredith
consulted
his
father
and
received
the
prompt
answer
yes
i
will
do
it
gladly
i
know
of
no
young
man
i
would
select
for
your
partner
in
preference
to
franklin
in
a
subsequent
interview
with
benjamin
meredith
said
i
am
all
the
more
ready
to
furnish
the
capital
because
your
influence
over
my
son
has
been
so
good
you
influenced
him
to
stop
drinking
when
he
was
fast
becoming
intemperate
and
i
shall
always
feel
grateful
for
it
you
are
just
the
one
to
be
intimately
associated
with
him
it
was
settled
that
they
should
enter
into
partnership
and
start
their
business
as
soon
as
the
necessary
outfit
could
be
obtained
from
england
xxx
the
club
benjamin
began
to
reflect
much
upon
his
religious
opinions
or
rather
irreligious
on
his
return
voyage
from
england
as
related
to
the
errors
and
mistakes
of
his
life
he
had
much
time
during
those
three
long
wearisome
months
to
study
himself
past
and
present
evidently
he
came
to
possess
a
more
correct
knowledge
of
himself
on
that
voyage
than
he
ever
had
before
he
was
so
sincere
in
the
matter
that
he
drew
up
a
number
of
rules
by
which
to
regulate
his
future
life
a
year
and
more
afterwards
he
enlarged
and
perfected
this
code
of
morals
the
rules
which
he
adopted
on
the
were
prefaced
with
the
following
paragraph
those
who
write
of
the
art
of
poetry
teach
us
that
if
we
would
write
what
may
be
worth
reading
we
ought
always
before
we
begin
to
form
a
regular
plan
and
design
of
our
piece
otherwise
we
shall
be
in
danger
of
incongruity
i
am
apt
to
think
it
is
the
same
as
to
life
i
have
never
fixed
a
regular
design
of
life
by
which
means
it
has
been
a
confused
variety
of
different
scenes
i
am
now
entering
upon
a
new
one
let
me
therefore
make
some
resolutions
and
form
some
scheme
of
action
that
thenceforth
i
may
live
like
a
rational
creature
the
closing
sentence
shows
that
his
conscience
was
making
him
considerable
trouble
and
that
he
concluded
his
life
had
been
very
irrational
perhaps
he
thought
of
collins
whom
he
made
a
free
thinker
and
of
ralph
whom
he
corrupted
in
the
same
way
one
of
them
became
a
drunkard
and
the
other
a
polygamist
both
of
them
cheating
him
out
of
a
sum
of
money
might
not
their
free
thinking
be
related
to
their
immoralities
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
these
things
and
so
he
wrote
down
the
following
rules
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
be
extremely
frugal
for
some
time
till
i
have
paid
what
i
owe
to
endeavor
to
speak
truth
in
every
instance
to
give
nobody
expectations
that
are
not
likely
to
be
answered
but
aim
at
sincerity
in
every
word
and
action
the
most
amiable
excellence
in
a
rational
being
to
apply
myself
industriously
to
whatever
business
i
take
in
hand
and
not
divert
my
mind
from
my
business
by
any
foolish
project
of
growing
suddenly
rich
for
industry
and
patience
are
the
surest
means
of
plenty
i
resolve
to
speak
ill
of
no
man
whatever
not
even
in
a
matter
of
truth
but
rather
by
some
means
excuse
the
faults
i
hear
charged
upon
others
and
upon
proper
occasions
speak
all
the
good
i
know
of
every
body
this
was
not
all
he
wrote
to
guide
his
future
career
but
we
have
cited
enough
to
show
the
current
of
benjamin
thoughts
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
we
shall
see
hereafter
that
he
did
not
cease
to
reflect
upon
his
career
and
resolve
upon
a
nobler
life
soon
after
his
return
from
england
perhaps
after
the
death
of
denham
benjamin
organized
a
literary
club
composed
at
first
of
eleven
members
all
of
them
more
or
less
talented
and
desirous
of
and
nearly
all
of
them
mechanics
which
fact
caused
the
institution
to
be
christened
the
club
although
the
real
name
of
it
as
suggested
by
franklin
was
the
junto
the
society
was
patterned
after
one
formed
by
cotton
mather
in
boston
the
first
thing
done
at
their
meetings
was
to
read
the
following
questions
pausing
after
reading
each
for
any
remarks
or
propositions
members
might
desire
to
make
the
principal
questions
were
as
follows
is
there
any
remarkable
disorder
in
the
place
that
requires
our
endeavor
for
the
suppression
of
it
and
in
what
fair
likely
way
may
we
endeavor
it
is
there
any
particular
person
whose
disorderly
behavior
may
be
so
scandalous
and
notorious
that
we
may
do
well
to
send
unto
the
said
person
our
charitable
admonitions
or
are
there
any
contending
persons
whom
we
should
admonish
to
quench
their
contentions
is
there
any
special
service
to
the
interest
of
religion
which
we
may
conveniently
desire
our
ministers
to
take
notice
of
is
there
any
thing
we
may
do
well
to
mention
unto
the
justices
for
the
further
promoting
good
order
is
there
any
sort
of
officers
among
us
to
such
a
degree
unmindful
of
their
duty
that
we
may
do
well
to
mind
them
of
it
can
any
further
methods
be
devised
that
ignorance
and
wickedness
may
be
chased
from
our
people
in
general
and
that
household
piety
in
particular
may
flourish
among
them
does
there
appear
any
instance
of
oppression
or
fraudulence
in
the
dealings
of
any
sort
of
people
that
may
call
for
our
essays
to
get
it
rectified
is
there
any
matter
to
be
humbly
moved
unto
the
legislative
power
to
be
enacted
into
a
law
for
the
public
benefit
do
we
know
of
any
person
languishing
under
sore
and
sad
affliction
and
is
there
any
thing
we
can
do
for
the
succor
of
such
an
afflicted
neighbor
has
any
person
any
proposal
to
make
for
our
own
further
advantage
and
assistance
that
we
ourselves
may
be
in
a
probable
and
regular
capacity
to
pursue
the
intention
before
us
i
should
pronounce
that
an
ingenious
society
for
doing
good
and
getting
good
said
coleman
after
the
questions
were
read
it
was
so
and
cotton
mather
himself
was
a
member
of
twenty
of
these
societies
said
benjamin
they
became
very
popular
and
i
recall
with
what
interest
my
father
participated
in
the
meetings
i
often
accompanied
him
and
young
as
i
was
they
were
very
interesting
to
me
it
was
that
fact
which
suggested
the
questions
i
have
reported
for
our
club
when
a
person
united
with
the
junto
he
was
required
to
stand
up
lay
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
answer
the
following
questions
have
you
any
particular
disrespect
to
any
present
member
i
have
not
do
you
sincerely
declare
that
you
love
mankind
in
general
of
what
profession
or
religion
soever
i
do
do
you
think
any
person
ought
to
be
harmed
in
his
body
name
or
goods
for
mere
speculative
opinion
or
his
external
way
of
worship
no
do
you
love
truth
for
truth
sake
and
will
you
endeavor
impartially
to
find
and
receive
it
yourself
and
communicate
it
to
others
yes
at
one
of
their
earliest
meetings
benjamin
proposed
that
each
member
the
number
of
members
was
limited
to
twelve
should
bring
his
books
to
the
for
reference
during
their
discussions
a
capital
idea
said
coleman
and
i
would
suggest
that
each
member
have
the
privilege
of
reading
the
books
belonging
to
other
members
another
good
idea
rejoined
benjamin
i
second
that
motion
with
all
my
heart
it
will
not
take
any
one
of
us
a
great
while
to
read
all
the
books
we
can
muster
suggested
potts
at
that
time
there
was
no
bookstore
in
philadelphia
nor
was
there
one
of
considerable
note
anywhere
in
the
colonies
except
in
boston
the
people
of
philadelphia
sent
to
england
for
the
books
they
wanted
which
was
expensive
and
inconvenient
after
this
plan
had
been
successfully
used
for
several
months
benjamin
made
another
proposition
i
propose
that
we
establish
a
library
interesting
parties
outside
to
join
us
in
the
enterprise
raising
money
for
the
same
by
subscription
do
you
mean
inquired
maugridge
yes
unless
there
is
a
better
way
of
doing
it
i
doubt
if
outsiders
can
be
interested
to
join
us
in
such
a
project
said
grace
few
people
care
enough
about
books
to
put
money
into
such
an
enterprise
perhaps
so
but
we
can
try
if
we
fail
we
shall
still
be
as
well
off
as
we
are
now
was
benjamin
answer
unless
we
make
the
effort
we
shall
never
know
what
we
can
do
and
you
are
the
one
to
solicit
subscriptions
ben
remarked
godfrey
if
anybody
can
succeed
you
can
if
i
should
undertake
and
fail
as
i
should
it
would
not
prove
that
the
scheme
is
impracticable
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
solicit
subscriptions
and
i
will
begin
at
once
and
be
able
to
report
success
or
failure
at
the
next
meeting
was
benjamin
generous
offer
at
the
following
meeting
he
was
able
to
report
success
so
far
as
he
had
been
able
to
work
and
he
continued
until
fifty
young
tradesmen
had
pledged
forty
shillings
each
as
a
subscription
and
in
addition
ten
shillings
per
annum
this
was
unexpected
success
and
the
members
of
the
junto
were
highly
elated
thus
was
established
the
first
circulating
library
in
this
country
benjamin
franklin
was
the
author
of
it
and
that
library
numbers
now
one
hundred
thousand
volumes
since
that
day
the
library
scheme
has
proved
so
beneficial
to
individuals
and
the
public
that
there
are
thousands
of
circulating
libraries
in
the
land
almost
every
town
of
two
or
three
thousand
inhabitants
has
one
it
must
not
be
forgotten
however
that
benjamin
franklin
conceived
and
reduced
the
idea
to
practice
the
following
are
some
of
the
questions
discussed
by
members
of
the
junto
is
sound
an
entity
or
body
how
may
the
phenomenon
of
vapors
be
explained
is
the
rudder
that
steers
mankind
the
universal
monarch
to
whom
all
are
tributaries
which
is
the
best
form
of
government
and
what
was
that
form
which
first
prevailed
among
mankind
can
any
one
particular
form
of
government
suit
all
mankind
what
is
the
reason
that
the
tides
rise
higher
in
the
bay
of
fundy
than
the
bay
of
delaware
is
the
emission
of
paper
money
safe
what
is
the
reason
that
men
of
the
greatest
knowledge
are
not
the
most
happy
how
may
the
possession
of
the
lakes
be
improved
to
our
advantage
why
are
tumultuous
uneasy
sensations
united
with
our
desires
whether
it
ought
to
be
the
aim
of
philosophy
to
eradicate
the
passions
how
may
smoky
chimneys
be
best
cured
why
does
the
flame
of
a
candle
tend
upwards
in
a
spire
which
is
the
least
criminal
a
action
joined
with
a
intention
or
a
action
with
a
intention
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
principles
of
liberty
in
a
free
government
to
punish
a
man
as
a
libeller
when
he
speaks
the
truth
the
foregoing
rules
and
questions
show
that
it
could
not
have
been
an
ordinary
class
of
young
men
to
meet
and
discuss
such
subjects
benjamin
talent
is
manifest
both
in
the
organization
and
the
themes
considered
improvements
have
been
the
order
of
the
day
since
the
junto
was
organized
but
we
doubt
if
there
has
been
much
improvement
upon
the
junto
in
literary
organizations
for
the
young
it
is
not
surprising
that
of
the
original
twelve
members
two
became
one
the
inventor
of
a
quadrant
one
a
distinguished
mechanic
and
influential
man
one
a
merchant
of
great
note
and
a
provincial
judge
and
all
but
one
respected
and
honored
men
at
the
same
time
benjamin
the
founder
became
minister
to
the
court
of
james
minister
plenipotentiary
to
france
and
the
greatest
statesman
and
philosopher
of
america
in
the
eighteenth
century
in
old
age
doctor
franklin
said
of
the
junto
it
was
the
best
school
of
philosophy
morality
and
politics
that
then
existed
in
the
province
for
our
queries
which
were
read
the
week
preceding
their
discussion
put
us
upon
reading
with
attention
on
the
several
subjects
that
we
might
speak
more
to
the
purpose
and
here
too
we
acquired
better
habits
of
conversation
every
thing
being
studied
in
our
rules
which
might
prevent
our
disgusting
each
other
the
junto
was
copied
in
england
fifty
years
after
benjamin
organized
it
in
philadelphia
by
cleming
jenkinson
who
became
earl
of
liverpool
and
others
and
within
it
they
began
careers
that
became
illustrious
it
has
been
copied
in
different
parts
of
our
own
land
down
to
the
present
day
blessing
the
people
and
the
country
in
more
ways
than
one
i
can
tell
you
how
to
get
over
the
difficulty
said
benjamin
let
each
member
get
up
a
club
of
twelve
and
that
will
give
a
chance
for
one
hundred
and
members
and
when
that
number
is
attained
i
suppose
you
will
have
each
one
of
the
one
hundred
and
organize
a
junto
and
that
will
make
the
membership
seventeen
hundred
and
enough
to
constitute
a
good
township
suggested
coleman
who
did
not
endorse
benjamin
plan
one
junto
will
be
of
more
service
to
members
as
well
as
to
the
public
than
a
dozen
can
be
only
abolish
the
limit
to
twelve
members
and
allow
all
who
desire
to
join
was
coleman
view
more
interesting
also
to
have
a
larger
number
of
members
suggested
parsons
numbers
create
enthusiasm
and
numbers
often
create
friction
too
retorted
benjamin
we
want
to
avoid
both
shoals
and
rocks
another
thing
that
i
object
to
very
much
is
this
if
each
one
of
us
organizes
another
junto
we
no
longer
associate
with
each
other
the
very
thing
for
which
this
junto
was
organized
this
was
the
strongest
objection
that
coleman
urged
that
is
the
selfish
side
of
the
question
suggested
benjamin
on
the
other
hand
there
will
be
twelve
times
as
many
persons
to
be
benefited
if
we
twelve
are
benefited
how
much
better
and
grander
to
have
one
hundred
and
benefited
ben
is
right
and
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
sooner
we
adopt
this
plan
the
better
it
will
be
unpleasant
to
sacrifice
our
social
connections
to
form
new
ones
but
the
new
ones
may
become
equally
pleasant
scull
thus
supported
benjamin
proposition
and
so
did
meredith
maugridge
and
others
this
discussion
arose
from
the
popularity
of
the
junto
it
became
so
popular
that
large
numbers
of
persons
wanted
to
join
it
and
besought
the
members
to
abolish
the
rule
limiting
the
membership
to
twelve
hence
benjamin
proposition
to
meet
the
exigency
which
was
carried
with
this
amendment
the
new
clubs
shall
be
auxiliary
to
this
the
original
one
each
reporting
its
proceedings
to
the
parent
society
that
one
harmonious
purpose
and
plan
may
characterize
all
all
the
members
did
not
organize
a
club
but
five
or
six
did
and
these
clubs
flourished
for
many
years
blessing
the
town
and
the
whole
colony
the
junto
was
not
many
months
old
when
benjamin
made
another
proposition
the
books
we
read
have
words
and
phrases
in
other
languages
and
i
do
not
know
their
meaning
i
studied
latin
some
in
boston
before
i
was
ten
years
old
and
latin
words
i
can
guess
at
but
french
i
ca
suppose
we
study
french
you
can
study
it
if
you
want
to
replied
scull
but
i
have
not
the
time
for
another
study
and
i
have
not
the
taste
for
it
said
meredith
one
language
is
all
that
i
can
handle
and
i
ca
handle
that
as
i
want
to
i
like
the
suggestion
responded
coleman
and
can
give
a
little
time
to
french
though
not
a
great
deal
if
ben
becomes
an
expert
linguist
he
can
translate
the
foreign
words
and
phrases
for
us
that
last
suggestion
is
best
of
all
remarked
parsons
ben
can
go
ahead
and
become
a
linguist
for
our
benefit
that
is
the
benevolent
side
of
this
question
punning
on
his
argument
for
the
benevolent
side
of
the
club
question
whether
other
members
of
the
junto
studied
the
languages
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
but
benjamin
did
with
remarkable
success
first
he
studied
french
and
when
he
could
read
it
quite
well
he
took
up
italian
and
spanish
by
this
time
he
became
so
interested
in
foreign
languages
that
he
revived
his
acquaintance
with
latin
becoming
quite
a
good
scholar
therein
it
was
a
mystery
to
his
companions
how
he
found
time
to
accomplish
so
much
but
he
did
it
by
method
and
industry
improving
the
smallest
fragments
of
time
working
early
and
late
he
was
very
fond
of
playing
chess
but
he
denied
himself
the
pleasure
wholly
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
more
time
for
study
while
at
keimer
he
found
more
time
for
reading
and
hard
study
because
his
employer
observed
saturday
as
his
sabbath
giving
only
five
days
in
the
week
to
work
xxxi
brighter
days
it
would
require
several
months
for
the
printing
outfit
ordered
from
england
to
reach
philadelphia
in
the
mean
time
benjamin
was
considering
what
to
do
and
while
canvassing
the
field
he
received
the
following
note
from
keimer
philadelphia
benjamin
franklin
it
is
not
wise
for
old
friends
like
you
and
i
to
separate
for
a
few
words
spoken
in
passion
i
was
very
hasty
and
am
sorry
for
it
i
want
my
old
foreman
back
again
at
the
old
price
i
have
plenty
of
work
and
if
you
think
well
of
my
proposition
come
and
see
me
yours
truly
samuel
keimer
benjamin
first
impulse
was
to
destroy
the
letter
and
take
no
further
notice
of
it
but
the
second
sober
thought
led
him
to
consult
meredith
who
continued
to
work
for
keimer
meredith
read
the
letter
and
said
i
should
advise
you
to
accept
his
proposition
as
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
can
you
tell
me
what
selfish
end
he
has
in
view
for
keimer
would
never
come
down
like
that
unless
he
had
an
axe
to
grind
benjamin
said
most
certainly
i
can
he
can
have
a
government
job
if
he
can
do
the
work
the
province
of
new
jersey
is
going
to
make
a
new
issue
of
paper
money
and
he
can
get
the
job
but
you
are
the
only
printer
in
philadelphia
who
can
do
that
work
so
he
wants
you
i
knew
there
must
be
something
of
that
sort
or
he
never
would
have
asked
for
my
work
again
he
is
too
contemptible
a
man
to
work
for
benjamin
spoke
with
much
feeling
and
he
was
right
too
but
here
is
the
point
continued
meredith
i
am
poorly
equipped
to
set
up
business
for
myself
and
you
can
teach
me
it
will
be
anywhere
from
six
to
eight
months
before
our
outfit
arrives
from
england
so
here
is
a
good
opportunity
for
me
to
improve
i
suppose
that
is
the
best
way
of
looking
at
it
but
keimer
has
so
little
manhood
about
him
that
i
have
no
respect
for
him
i
dislike
to
work
for
a
man
whom
i
despise
and
ca
help
it
benjamin
language
showed
that
it
was
almost
too
much
to
ask
him
to
return
to
printing
office
but
meredith
persevered
for
my
sake
i
want
you
should
decide
to
accept
the
proposition
keimer
has
made
an
apology
so
that
you
can
return
without
compromising
your
manhood
at
all
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
were
wiser
to
accept
his
proposal
than
to
decline
it
i
will
sleep
over
it
before
i
decide
and
let
you
know
in
the
morning
replied
benjamin
as
he
took
his
leave
in
the
morning
benjamin
put
in
his
appearance
at
keimer
office
ready
for
work
he
received
a
hearty
welcome
and
was
at
once
apprized
of
the
job
of
new
jersey
benjamin
succeeded
in
contriving
and
completing
a
press
and
when
cuts
and
ornaments
were
all
ready
keimer
and
he
proceeded
to
burlington
where
they
remained
three
months
to
fulfill
the
contract
it
proved
a
rare
school
for
benjamin
it
brought
him
in
contact
with
many
prominent
men
who
were
of
much
assistance
to
him
afterwards
he
was
so
much
more
intelligent
than
keimer
that
the
latter
was
of
little
consequence
as
very
little
notice
was
taken
of
him
one
day
isaac
decon
the
said
to
him
you
are
complete
master
of
your
business
and
success
is
before
you
i
have
improved
my
opportunities
modestly
answered
benjamin
and
done
the
best
i
could
to
learn
my
trade
i
do
like
the
method
of
doing
business
i
commenced
business
in
a
very
humble
way
continued
decon
without
dreaming
that
i
should
ever
possess
such
an
estate
as
i
do
now
what
was
your
business
i
wheeled
clay
for
the
brickmakers
and
had
no
opportunity
of
going
to
school
in
my
boyhood
i
did
not
learn
to
write
until
i
became
of
age
i
acquired
my
knowledge
of
surveying
when
i
carried
a
chain
for
surveyors
who
were
pleased
with
my
desire
to
learn
the
business
and
assisted
me
by
constant
industry
and
close
application
and
not
a
little
perseverance
i
have
succeeded
in
reaching
the
place
where
you
now
see
me
that
is
the
only
way
any
person
ever
reached
an
honorable
position
remarked
benjamin
after
listening
to
the
interesting
story
of
success
you
are
right
in
that
view
and
of
the
battle
is
fought
when
correct
views
of
life
are
fixed
when
an
employer
like
keimer
is
inferior
to
his
employee
in
ability
tact
and
enterprise
there
is
a
very
poor
show
for
him
if
you
set
up
for
yourself
in
philadelphia
you
will
work
him
completely
out
of
his
business
late
in
the
spring
of
the
printing
outfit
arrived
from
england
benjamin
and
meredith
had
settled
with
keimer
who
was
unusually
happy
because
his
profits
on
his
job
in
new
jersey
had
tided
him
over
very
discouraging
embarrassments
keimer
knew
nothing
of
their
plans
however
when
a
settlement
was
consummated
as
both
had
kept
the
secret
the
first
intimation
that
he
or
the
public
had
of
such
an
enterprise
was
the
opening
of
their
printing
house
in
the
lower
part
of
market
street
franklin
meredith
here
a
man
looking
for
a
printer
said
george
house
an
old
friend
of
benjamin
he
inquired
of
me
where
he
could
get
a
job
done
and
i
told
him
that
here
was
the
place
above
all
others
thank
you
for
the
advertisement
george
yes
sir
we
can
serve
you
here
at
short
notice
what
will
you
have
done
benjamin
won
the
customer
over
at
once
by
his
genial
familiar
way
the
man
made
known
his
wants
and
it
proved
to
be
a
job
all
the
more
acceptable
because
it
was
the
first
with
the
members
of
the
junto
all
interested
in
his
success
and
the
public
men
of
new
jersey
who
made
his
acquaintance
at
burlington
benjamin
business
was
soon
well
advertised
many
people
were
taken
by
surprise
and
most
of
them
predicted
a
failure
since
there
were
two
printers
in
town
already
one
day
samuel
nickle
an
old
citizen
of
the
town
known
somewhat
as
a
croaker
was
passing
by
and
looking
up
he
read
the
sign
another
printing
house
he
said
to
himself
and
two
in
town
already
who
can
be
so
thoughtless
he
stopped
and
mused
a
few
moments
and
then
entered
are
you
the
young
man
who
has
opened
this
printing
house
he
inquired
of
benjamin
i
am
sir
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
you
are
throwing
away
your
money
you
succeed
with
two
old
printing
houses
here
you
will
fail
what
makes
you
think
so
because
philadelphia
is
degenerating
and
half
the
people
are
now
bankrupt
or
nearly
so
and
how
can
they
support
so
many
printers
but
the
appearance
of
philadelphia
indicates
thrift
answered
benjamin
see
how
many
buildings
are
going
up
and
how
rents
are
rising
every
month
this
does
not
look
like
going
backward
it
seems
to
me
these
are
the
very
things
that
will
ruin
us
responded
nickle
they
are
no
evidence
of
prosperity
but
of
extravagance
that
will
bring
disaster
sooner
or
later
that
sort
of
disaster
is
what
we
want
suggested
benjamin
the
more
of
it
the
better
if
philadelphia
ever
becomes
much
of
a
town
it
will
be
in
just
that
way
benjamin
saw
at
once
that
he
was
talking
with
a
croaker
and
treated
him
accordingly
there
was
an
organization
of
business
men
in
philadelphia
at
that
time
known
as
the
merchants
club
answering
perhaps
to
a
board
of
trade
of
our
day
its
purpose
was
to
advance
the
business
interests
of
the
town
a
member
raised
the
question
can
another
printing
house
prosper
in
town
not
with
the
present
population
was
the
view
of
one
member
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
three
printing
houses
will
be
required
remarked
another
they
could
not
have
had
very
discreet
advisers
it
seems
to
me
still
another
remarked
in
this
manner
the
subject
was
canvassed
every
member
but
one
predicting
the
failure
of
the
enterprise
that
one
was
doctor
baird
a
prominent
physician
and
he
said
it
will
prove
a
success
for
the
industry
of
that
franklin
is
superior
to
any
thing
i
ever
saw
of
the
kind
i
see
him
still
at
work
when
i
go
home
from
club
and
he
is
at
work
again
before
his
neighbors
are
out
of
bed
doctor
i
guess
you
are
right
i
did
not
think
of
that
when
i
spoke
remarked
one
who
had
predicted
failure
this
member
was
so
much
impressed
by
doctor
baird
remark
that
he
subsequently
went
to
benjamin
and
made
this
proposition
i
think
you
can
add
a
stationer
department
to
your
business
and
thus
increase
your
profits
and
if
you
think
so
i
will
furnish
you
with
stock
on
credit
your
offer
is
a
very
generous
one
and
i
thank
you
for
it
answered
benjamin
but
i
think
we
had
better
stick
to
our
trade
at
present
and
not
put
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
at
once
that
is
a
wise
caution
i
think
and
i
am
all
the
more
impressed
that
you
are
a
young
man
of
sound
judgment
and
you
will
succeed
he
had
no
doubt
now
that
the
printing
house
would
succeed
your
good
opinion
encourages
me
very
much
and
i
shall
do
my
best
to
have
it
realized
replied
benjamin
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
generous
offer
and
perhaps
at
some
future
day
i
shall
wish
to
accept
it
let
me
know
whenever
you
are
ready
for
it
said
the
gentleman
as
he
took
his
departure
we
will
start
a
weekly
paper
as
soon
as
we
are
able
said
benjamin
to
meredith
one
day
the
is
as
near
nothing
as
it
can
be
i
believe
that
an
able
paper
here
abreast
with
the
times
will
succeed
you
can
make
it
succeed
if
any
one
can
replied
meredith
to
whom
his
partner
had
given
a
full
account
of
his
connection
with
the
england
in
boston
they
canvassed
the
subject
until
it
was
decided
to
start
a
weekly
paper
as
soon
as
their
pecuniary
condition
would
permit
just
then
the
oxford
student
whose
time
keimer
had
bought
called
upon
benjamin
will
you
employ
me
as
journeyman
printer
he
asked
employ
you
responded
benjamin
with
much
surprise
i
thought
your
time
was
keimer
for
four
years
it
was
but
it
is
not
now
i
have
bought
it
back
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
will
be
more
of
a
man
for
it
and
before
long
i
think
we
should
like
your
work
just
now
we
are
not
in
want
of
more
help
your
work
is
increasing
i
suppose
said
webb
hope
i
shall
not
have
to
wait
long
if
you
can
keep
a
secret
webb
i
will
let
you
into
it
continued
benjamin
i
expect
to
start
a
weekly
paper
before
many
weeks
have
passed
and
then
i
shall
have
plenty
of
work
how
long
shall
i
have
to
wait
i
ca
say
it
is
possible
i
may
want
you
before
i
start
the
newspaper
work
is
coming
in
very
well
but
you
must
not
let
keimer
know
about
the
paper
when
it
starts
i
want
it
should
be
a
surprise
to
him
and
the
public
i
will
not
divulge
your
secret
was
webb
ready
promise
nevertheless
webb
did
disclose
the
secret
to
keimer
himself
who
proceeded
to
start
a
paper
of
his
own
called
the
and
he
hired
webb
at
good
wages
to
work
on
it
it
proved
to
be
a
miserable
affair
without
ability
or
intelligent
enterprise
so
that
a
sharp
witty
young
man
like
benjamin
could
readily
make
it
a
i
will
show
up
his
ignorance
and
conceit
in
the
name
of
the
paper
already
published
by
bradford
he
said
to
meredith
see
if
i
do
a
good
idea
ben
go
ahead
it
will
create
a
sensation
bradford
will
be
glad
to
publish
any
thing
you
may
write
i
will
see
him
at
once
and
benjamin
hastened
to
the
office
of
the
made
known
his
purpose
to
bradford
who
caught
at
it
at
once
just
the
thing
i
want
responded
bradford
let
me
have
something
for
the
next
issue
certainly
you
shall
have
the
first
article
morning
benjamin
hurried
away
with
his
mind
completely
absorbed
upon
the
subjects
he
should
take
up
the
result
was
a
series
of
amusing
articles
in
which
he
burlesqued
keimer
proposals
and
ridiculed
his
editorials
which
really
deserved
nothing
better
he
continued
to
write
in
this
way
several
months
signing
all
his
articles
the
public
were
greatly
interested
in
the
communications
because
of
their
real
merit
they
were
bright
even
sparkling
full
of
humor
logical
to
sharpness
and
charged
with
ability
they
drew
public
attention
to
bradford
paper
and
public
ridicule
to
keimer
so
that
the
subscription
list
of
the
former
increased
while
that
of
the
latter
never
had
over
ninety
subscribers
people
on
every
hand
inquired
who
is
and
finally
the
public
learned
that
it
was
that
young
franklin
the
printer
keimer
learned
who
his
critic
was
and
after
the
lapse
of
six
or
eight
months
from
the
time
the
first
number
was
issued
who
should
appear
before
benjamin
at
his
office
but
him
saying
i
understand
that
you
think
of
starting
a
weekly
newspaper
and
i
have
come
to
sell
you
mine
how
is
that
ca
you
make
it
go
benjamin
replied
in
a
familiar
way
no
not
as
i
want
to
i
do
think
i
am
exactly
qualified
to
run
a
newspaper
how
many
subscribers
have
you
ninety
only
ninety
exclaimed
benjamin
that
number
will
be
of
no
aid
in
starting
a
paper
might
as
well
start
new
new
paper
new
title
new
editor
new
every
thing
the
conclusion
of
the
interview
was
however
that
benjamin
purchased
the
paper
took
possession
immediately
advertised
his
literary
enterprise
and
it
proved
as
he
said
in
a
few
years
extremely
profitable
to
me
his
economy
was
equal
to
his
industry
he
arrayed
himself
in
the
plainest
manner
although
he
aimed
to
look
neat
and
tidy
his
board
was
simple
and
cheap
and
every
thing
about
his
business
was
conducted
on
the
most
economical
principles
he
wheeled
home
the
paper
which
he
bought
boarded
himself
some
of
the
time
sleeping
in
the
office
and
never
stopped
to
consider
whether
it
was
compromising
the
dignity
of
a
printer
to
do
such
things
keimer
left
no
stone
unturned
to
secure
business
and
cripple
franklin
and
meredith
he
was
never
half
so
active
and
enterprising
as
he
became
after
these
two
young
men
set
up
for
themselves
one
day
keimer
was
in
benjamin
printing
office
to
transact
some
business
when
the
latter
said
to
him
look
here
keimer
come
with
me
into
the
back
room
what
you
got
there
keimer
answered
following
see
that
benjamin
said
pointing
to
a
loaf
and
pitcher
of
water
that
he
had
just
made
a
meal
off
what
of
that
said
keimer
not
comprehending
the
drift
of
remark
unless
you
can
live
cheaper
than
i
can
it
is
no
use
for
you
to
attempt
to
run
me
out
of
business
both
laughed
and
keimer
departed
the
flourished
finely
from
the
time
it
came
under
management
he
was
able
to
discuss
public
questions
of
importance
with
manifest
ability
and
his
articles
created
interest
and
discussion
among
public
men
who
became
subscribers
in
consequence
a
dispute
was
going
on
between
governor
burnett
and
the
massachusetts
assembly
and
benjamin
commented
upon
it
with
so
much
wisdom
and
originality
that
his
intimate
acquaintance
was
sought
by
the
most
distinguished
men
benjamin
work
as
a
printer
excelled
that
of
either
keimer
or
bradford
the
latter
did
the
government
printing
and
often
it
was
done
in
a
very
bungling
manner
this
was
notably
so
when
he
printed
an
address
of
the
house
to
the
governor
it
was
a
very
inferior
job
whereupon
benjamin
printed
it
elegantly
and
correctly
and
sent
a
copy
to
each
member
of
the
house
the
house
voted
to
give
him
the
government
printing
thereafter
by
his
method
of
doing
the
he
could
every
time
he
built
up
a
business
rapidly
and
won
a
reputation
for
industry
integrity
and
ability
that
was
worth
more
than
money
to
return
to
meredith
he
had
become
more
intemperate
than
ever
his
father
too
did
not
find
relief
from
pecuniary
embarrassment
as
he
expected
he
was
to
pay
two
hundred
pounds
currency
for
the
printing
house
and
had
paid
of
it
but
the
other
half
was
not
paid
when
due
for
which
all
three
were
sued
perhaps
your
father
is
not
pleased
with
your
partner
said
benjamin
to
meredith
if
that
is
the
reason
he
does
not
advance
the
money
i
will
retire
and
you
shall
run
the
whole
thing
no
my
father
is
well
satisfied
with
my
partner
and
so
am
i
so
that
you
need
not
think
he
is
withholding
money
for
the
purpose
of
getting
rid
of
you
he
is
really
embarrassed
then
he
could
not
take
the
concern
into
his
own
hands
for
you
to
run
no
indeed
that
would
be
quite
impossible
besides
i
do
not
want
it
on
my
hands
why
inquired
benjamin
because
i
am
satisfied
that
i
am
not
adapted
to
this
business
i
was
bred
a
farmer
and
ought
not
to
have
left
that
occupation
drink
water
as
i
do
and
you
may
succeed
as
well
at
printing
as
farming
a
farmer
who
drinks
to
excess
never
succeeds
drink
or
no
drink
retorted
meredith
i
am
sick
of
this
business
and
shall
quit
many
of
our
welsh
people
are
going
to
settle
in
north
carolina
where
land
is
cheap
and
i
am
going
with
them
and
shall
follow
my
old
employment
then
you
will
sell
out
your
interest
to
me
if
i
understand
you
that
was
what
benjamin
wanted
certainly
you
can
get
enough
friends
to
help
you
if
you
will
take
the
debts
of
the
company
upon
you
return
to
my
father
the
hundred
pounds
he
has
advanced
pay
my
little
personal
debts
and
give
me
thirty
pounds
and
a
new
saddle
i
will
relinquish
the
partnership
and
leave
the
whole
in
your
hands
i
will
accept
your
proposition
and
we
will
draw
up
the
papers
at
once
said
benjamin
the
bargain
was
consummated
and
the
proper
papers
were
prepared
signed
and
sealed
benjamin
accepted
the
generous
aid
of
coleman
and
grace
and
became
sole
proprietor
of
the
printing
house
and
this
was
near
the
close
of
the
year
a
few
months
after
the
came
into
his
hands
a
few
months
more
elapsed
when
he
concluded
to
accept
the
offer
of
the
gentleman
spoken
of
on
a
previous
page
to
provide
a
stock
of
stationery
and
opened
a
stationer
shop
in
his
building
this
proved
a
good
investment
and
led
to
his
marriage
september
to
miss
deborah
read
while
benjamin
was
thus
prospering
keimer
was
going
to
the
wall
and
finally
his
printing
office
with
all
its
furniture
was
sold
under
the
hammer
to
pay
his
creditors
and
he
went
to
barbadoes
where
he
lived
in
poverty
thus
changes
brought
benjamin
to
the
front
and
his
printing
house
was
the
best
doing
the
most
business
of
any
one
in
the
whole
country
except
boston
true
bradford
continued
his
business
and
paper
but
in
a
very
small
way
in
no
sense
a
rival
to
our
hero
he
stood
at
the
head
xxxii
no
longer
a
skeptic
time
is
money
doctor
franklin
wrote
in
age
it
was
what
he
practised
when
he
conducted
his
printing
business
in
philadelphia
one
day
a
lounger
stepped
into
his
shop
and
after
looking
over
the
articles
asked
what
is
the
price
of
that
book
holding
it
up
in
his
hand
benjamin
had
commenced
to
keep
a
few
books
on
sale
one
dollar
answered
the
apprentice
in
attendance
one
dollar
repeated
the
lounger
ca
you
take
less
than
that
no
less
one
dollar
is
the
price
waiting
a
few
moments
and
still
looking
over
the
book
he
said
at
length
is
franklin
at
home
he
is
in
the
printing
office
i
want
to
see
him
will
you
call
him
franklin
was
called
franklin
what
is
the
lowest
price
you
will
take
for
this
book
at
the
same
time
holding
up
the
book
one
dollar
and
a
quarter
answered
franklin
who
had
heard
the
lounger
parleying
with
his
apprentice
one
dollar
and
a
quarter
your
young
man
asked
but
a
dollar
true
answered
franklin
and
i
could
have
better
afforded
to
take
a
dollar
then
than
to
have
been
called
from
my
business
the
customer
seemed
puzzled
for
a
few
moments
but
finally
concluded
that
the
proprietor
was
joking
he
had
not
been
wont
to
place
so
great
value
upon
time
come
now
tell
me
just
the
lowest
you
will
take
for
it
he
said
one
dollar
and
a
half
a
dollar
and
a
half
why
you
offered
it
yourself
for
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
true
and
i
had
better
taken
the
price
then
than
a
dollar
and
a
half
now
retorted
benjamin
with
a
good
deal
of
spirit
the
buyer
got
the
truth
into
his
head
at
last
paid
the
price
of
the
book
and
sneaked
away
with
the
rebuke
lying
heavily
on
his
heart
benjamin
wrote
of
his
industry
at
that
time
as
follows
my
circumstances
however
grew
daily
easier
my
original
habits
of
frugality
continuing
and
my
father
having
among
his
instructions
to
me
when
a
boy
frequently
repeated
a
proverb
of
solomon
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
calling
he
shall
stand
before
kings
he
shall
not
stand
before
mean
i
thence
considered
industry
as
a
means
of
obtaining
wealth
and
distinction
which
encouraged
me
though
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
ever
literally
before
which
however
has
since
happened
for
i
have
stood
before
and
even
had
the
honor
of
sitting
down
with
one
the
king
of
denmark
to
dinner
it
is
not
strange
that
such
a
young
man
should
write
such
maxims
as
the
following
in
his
riper
years
pride
breakfasts
with
plenty
dines
with
poverty
and
sups
with
infamy
it
is
as
truly
folly
for
the
poor
to
ape
the
rich
as
for
the
frog
to
swell
in
order
to
equal
the
ox
it
is
easier
to
suppress
the
first
desire
than
to
satisfy
all
that
follow
it
his
integrity
was
no
less
marked
strict
honesty
characterized
all
his
dealings
with
men
an
exalted
idea
of
justice
pervaded
his
soul
his
word
of
honor
was
as
good
as
his
note
of
hand
even
his
disposition
to
castigate
and
censure
in
his
writings
so
manifest
in
boston
at
sixteen
years
of
age
and
which
his
father
rebuked
was
overcome
after
he
had
set
up
a
paper
in
philadelphia
a
gentleman
handed
him
an
article
for
its
columns
i
am
very
busy
now
said
benjamin
and
you
will
confer
a
favor
by
leaving
it
for
perusal
at
my
leisure
that
i
will
do
and
call
again
the
following
day
the
author
put
in
his
appearance
quite
early
what
is
your
opinion
of
my

he
asked
why
sir
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
can
not
publish
it
why
not
what
is
the
matter
with
it
it
is
highly
scurrilous
and
defamatory
replied
benjamin
but
being
at
a
loss
on
account
of
my
poverty
whether
to
reject
it
or
not
i
thought
i
would
put
it
to
this
issue
at
night
when
my
work
was
done
i
bought
a
twopenny
loaf
on
which
i
supped
heartily
and
then
wrapping
myself
in
my
great
coat
slept
very
soundly
on
the
floor
until
morning
when
another
loaf
and
mug
of
water
afforded
a
pleasant
breakfast
now
sir
since
i
can
live
very
comfortably
in
this
manner
why
should
i
prostitute
my
press
to
personal
hatred
or
party
passion
for
a
more
luxurious
living
we
have
seen
that
benjamin
began
to
revise
his
religious
opinions
on
his
return
voyage
from
england
he
continued
to
reflect
much
upon
his
loose
ways
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
integrity
industry
economy
and
desire
to
succeed
in
business
had
something
to
do
with
his
moral
improvement
he
confessed
that
along
from
to
he
was
immoral
and
was
sometimes
led
astray
but
his
conscience
made
him
much
trouble
and
finally
it
asserted
its
supremacy
and
he
came
off
conqueror
over
his
evil
propensities
a
change
from
skepticism
or
deism
to
a
decided
belief
in
the
christian
religion
no
doubt
exerted
the
strongest
influence
in
making
him
a
better
man
in
he
prepared
of
belief
and
acts
of
for
his
own
use
every
day
this
was
his
ritual
beginning
and
closing
with
an
humble
prayer
three
or
four
years
later
he
appears
to
have
taken
up
this
thought
of
a
religious
life
anew
and
he
prepared
a
code
of
morals
perhaps
a
revision
of
his
former
articles
of
faith
wrote
them
out
carefully
in
a
blank
book
for
use
as
follows
eat
not
to
dulness
drink
not
to
elevation
speak
not
but
what
may
benefit
others
or
yourself
avoid
trifling
conversation
let
all
your
things
have
their
places
let
each
part
of
your
business
have
its
time
resolve
to
perform
what
you
ought
perform
without
fail
what
you
resolve
make
no
expense
but
to
do
good
to
others
or
yourself
that
is
waste
nothing
lose
no
time
be
always
employed
in
something
useful
cut
off
all
unnecessary
actions
use
no
hurtful
deceit
think
innocently
and
justly
and
if
you
speak
speak
accordingly
wrong
none
by
doing
injuries
or
omitting
the
benefits
that
are
your
duty
avoid
extremes
forbear
resenting
injuries
so
much
as
you
think
they
deserve
tolerate
no
uncleanliness
in
body
clothes
or
habitation
be
not
disturbed
at
trifles
or
at
accidents
common
or
unavoidable
chastity
imitate
jesus
and
socrates
at
one
time
he
seriously
thought
of
organizing
a
united
party
for
virtue
in
connection
with
which
he
prepared
this
religious
creed
that
there
is
one
god
who
made
all
things
that
he
governs
the
world
by
his
providence
that
he
ought
to
be
worshipped
by
adoration
prayer
and
thanksgiving
but
that
the
most
acceptable
service
to
god
is
doing
good
to
man
that
the
soul
is
immortal
and
that
god
will
certainly
reward
virtue
and
punish
vice
either
here
or
hereafter
his
letters
to
relatives
and
friends
from
this
time
contained
strong
words
for
the
christian
religion
and
for
the
imitation
of
the
virtues
practised
by
its
author
through
his
long
and
useful
life
he
continued
to
observe
the
doctrines
and
precepts
that
he
named
in
the
foregoing
extracts
he
was
a
delegate
to
the
convention
for
forming
a
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
met
at
philadelphia
may
and
he
introduced
the
motion
for
daily
prayers
with
remarks
thus
in
the
beginning
of
the
contest
with
britain
when
we
were
sensible
of
danger
we
had
daily
prayers
in
this
room
for
the
divine
protection
our
prayers
sir
were
heard
and
they
were
graciously
answered
all
of
us
who
were
engaged
in
the
struggle
must
have
observed
frequent
instances
of
a
superintending
providence
in
our
favor
to
that
kind
providence
we
owe
this
happy
opportunity
of
consulting
in
peace
on
the
means
of
establishing
our
future
national
felicity
and
have
we
now
forgotten
that
powerful
friend
or
do
we
imagine
we
no
longer
need
his
assistance
i
have
lived
sir
a
long
time
and
the
longer
i
live
the
more
convincing
proofs
i
see
of
this
truth
god
in
the
affairs
of
and
if
a
sparrow
can
not
fall
to
the
ground
without
his
notice
is
it
probably
that
an
empire
can
rise
without
his
aid
we
have
been
assured
sir
in
the
sacred
writings
that
the
lord
build
the
house
they
labor
in
vain
that
build
it
i
firmly
believe
this
and
i
also
believe
that
without
his
concurring
aid
we
shall
succeed
in
this
political
building
no
better
than
the
builders
of
babel
we
shall
be
divided
by
our
little
partial
local
interests
our
projects
will
be
confounded
and
we
ourselves
shall
become
a
reproach
and
a
down
to
future
ages
we
will
only
add
here
an
epitaph
that
he
wrote
for
his
own
monument
at
years
of
age
supposed
to
have
been
a
paper
for
the
junto
the
body
of
benjamin
franklin
printer
like
the
cover
of
an
old
book
its
contents
torn
out
and
stript
of
its
lettering
and
gilding
lies
here
food
for
worms
but
the
work
itself
shall
not
be
lost
for
it
will
as
he
believed
appear
once
more
in
a
new
and
more
elegant
edition
revised
and
corrected
by
the
author
xxxiii
poor
richard
almanac
i
shall
have
to
publish
an
almanac
to
be
in
fashion
remarked
franklin
to
his
old
friend
coleman
every
printer
in
this
country
issues
one
so
far
as
i
know
from
this
point
we
shall
drop
the
christian
name
benjamin
and
use
the
surname
franklin
a
good
theme
to
discuss
in
the
junto
replied
coleman
you
would
publish
a
better
one
than
the
country
ever
had
if
you
should
undertake
it
i
shall
make
one
that
differs
from
all
issued
hitherto
in
some
respects
i
have
devoted
considerable
thought
to
the
subject
and
have
formed
a
plan
although
it
has
not
taken
an
exact
shape
yet
in
my
own
mind
i
think
i
will
bring
it
up
in
the
junto
by
all
means
do
it
added
coleman
two
or
more
heads
may
be
better
than
one
alone
even
if
the
one
contains
more
than
all
the
rest
much
obliged
answered
franklin
it
will
aid
me
essentially
to
mature
my
plans
to
exchange
views
with
the
members
of
the
junto
i
will
introduce
it
at
the
very
next
meeting
the
subject
was
introduced
into
the
junto
as
proposed
and
every
member
hailed
the
project
with
delight
franklin
paper
had
become
the
most
popular
one
in
the
country
in
consequence
of
the
ability
with
which
it
discussed
public
questions
and
the
sharp
crisp
wisdom
and
wit
that
made
every
issue
entertaining
and
the
members
believed
that
he
could
make
an
almanac
that
would
take
the
lead
the
discussion
in
the
junto
settled
the
question
of
issuing
the
almanac
its
appearance
in
proved
a
remarkable
event
in
franklin
life
much
more
so
than
his
most
sanguine
friends
anticipated
the
almanac
appeared
with
the
bearing
the
imprint
by
richard
saunders
philomat
printed
and
sold
by
b
franklin
from
the
opening
to
the
close
of
it
proverbial
sayings
charged
with
wisdom
and
wit
were
inserted
wherever
there
was
space
enough
to
insert
one
the
following
is
a
sample
sloth
like
rust
consumes
faster
than
labor
wears
while
the
used
key
is
always
bright
lost
time
is
never
found
again
and
what
we
call
time
enough
always
proves
little
enough
drive
thy
business
let
not
that
drive
thee
industry
need
not
hope
and
he
that
lives
upon
hope
will
die
fasting
he
that
hath
a
trade
hath
an
estate
and
he
that
hath
a
calling
hath
an
office
of
profit
and
honor
at
the
house
hunger
looks
in
but
dares
not
enter
never
leave
that
till
which
you
can
do
a
life
of
leisure
and
a
life
of
laziness
are
two
things
if
you
would
have
your
business
done
go
if
not
send
what
maintains
one
vice
would
bring
up
two
children
when
the
well
is
dry
they
know
the
worth
of
water
pride
is
as
loud
a
beggar
as
want
and
a
great
deal
more
saucy
experience
keeps
a
dear
school
but
fools
will
learn
in
no
other
the
good
paymaster
is
lord
of
another
man
purse
these
jets
of
wisdom
made
the
almanac
sparkle
the
mechanical
execution
of
the
work
excelled
that
of
any
of
its
predecessors
but
this
literary
feature
marked
the
almanac
as
marvellous
it
became
popular
at
once
every
body
who
saw
it
admired
and
bought
it
the
philadelphians
were
proud
that
such
a
document
originated
in
their
town
copies
were
sent
to
friends
in
other
parts
of
the
country
until
poor
richard
almanac
was
known
throughout
the
land
three
editions
were
exhausted
in
about
a
month
for
years
franklin
continued
to
publish
a
similar
almanac
the
average
annual
circulation
of
which
was
ten
thousand
copies
the
large
stock
of
wisdom
and
wit
which
the
almanac
contained
added
wonderfully
to
franklin
fame
from
the
first
issue
his
mental
powers
were
widely
praised
he
was
only
years
of
age
but
now
his
intellectual
ability
was
considered
superior
to
that
of
any
other
living
man
under
fifty
years
of
age
the
members
of
the
junto
were
greatly
elated
over
his
success
you
have
beaten
yourself
remarked
coleman
to
him
exceeded
by
far
what
i
expected
high
as
my
expectations
were
nothing
has
been
published
yet
that
has
created
so
profound
interest
as
the
almanac
that
is
all
true
said
grace
franklin
is
the
theme
of
remark
now
everywhere
people
seem
to
be
surprised
that
he
could
produce
a
document
of
so
much
value
both
his
business
and
newspaper
will
be
advanced
by
this
stroke
of
wisdom
and
the
junto
too
suggested
parsons
the
father
of
the
junto
can
not
receive
so
much
applause
without
benefiting
his
child
every
body
will
want
to
join
now
to
meet
him
here
each
member
present
was
too
much
elated
to
remain
silent
no
words
were
too
extravagant
to
express
their
admiration
of
ability
to
their
decided
friendship
and
respect
was
now
added
an
honorable
pride
in
being
able
to
point
to
such
a
friend
and
associate
the
success
of
his
newspaper
and
almanac
provided
franklin
with
a
supply
of
money
which
he
wisely
invested
his
own
words
about
it
were
my
business
was
now
constantly
augmenting
and
my
circumstances
growing
daily
easier
my
newspaper
having
become
very
profitable
as
being
for
a
time
almost
the
only
one
in
this
and
the
neighboring
provinces
i
experienced
too
the
truth
of
the
observation
after
getting
the
first
hundred
pounds
it
is
more
easy
to
get
the
money
itself
being
of
a
prolific
nature
franklin
was
aided
very
much
in
the
conduct
of
his
paper
by
the
junto
where
different
features
of
journalism
were
often
discussed
in
boston
i
made
a
mistake
he
said
i
was
but
a
boy
then
without
experience
or
discretion
and
found
great
delight
in
personalities
i
mean
to
steer
clear
of
libelling
and
personal
abuse
you
have
so
far
replied
coleman
and
thereby
you
have
added
to
the
dignity
and
influence
of
your
paper
there
is
a
kind
of
sharpness
and
critical
remark
that
ought
to
characterize
a
good
paper
and
the
is
not
deficient
in
that
that
is
what
makes
it
sparkle
in
my
judgment
remarked
scull
it
is
not
best
to
be
too
cautious
some
things
ought
to
be
hit
hard
and
that
is
true
of
some
men
not
to
say
women
that
is
one
thing
a
newspaper
is
for
interjected
parsons
to
expose
and
remove
social
and
public
evils
and
in
doing
that
some
men
will
get
hit
you
do
not
quite
understand
me
answered
franklin
i
accept
all
that
scull
and
parsons
say
which
is
not
what
i
mean
by
libelling
and
personal
abuse
here
is
a
case
a
few
days
ago
a
gentleman
called
with
an
article
for
the
i
looked
it
over
and
found
it
very
objectionable
can
not
publish
that
i
said
to
him
not
he
asked
it
deals
in
personal
abuse
if
not
in
downright
libelling
will
pay
for
its
insertion
he
said
much
the
worse
for
me
to
insert
a
libelous
article
for
money
i
said
the
face
of
it
it
appears
a
personal
pique
against
the
party
we
have
a
free
press
in
this
country
he
insisted
to
do
right
and
be
just
and
honorable
toward
all
men
and
not
free
to
injure
or
abuse
them
i
retorted
supposed
that
a
newspaper
was
like
a
stage
coach
in
which
any
one
who
pays
for
a
place
has
it
he
continued
is
true
of
some
newspapers
but
not
of
mine
i
answered
i
will
do
this
i
will
print
your
article
separately
and
furnish
you
with
as
many
copies
as
you
want
and
you
can
distribute
them
where
you
please
but
i
will
not
lumber
my
columns
with
detraction
and
insult
patrons
to
whom
i
am
pledged
to
furnish
a
good
paper
for
their
families
the
party
did
not
accept
my
proposition
but
left
in
high
temper
every
member
acquiesced
in
franklin
views
and
encouraged
him
to
continue
the
conduct
of
his
paper
on
that
line
it
was
an
age
of
vituperation
and
libelling
probably
there
never
has
been
a
time
since
when
so
many
editors
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
papers
believed
that
the
newspaper
was
for
that
purpose
the
gentleman
of
whom
franklin
spoke
wanted
to
abuse
another
but
would
have
complained
bitterly
no
doubt
to
have
been
the
object
of
abuse
himself
franklin
stationer
shop
proved
a
success
and
very
soon
he
added
a
small
collection
of
books
from
he
imported
books
from
london
and
aimed
to
keep
the
market
supplied
with
all
that
were
popular
there
his
trade
in
books
grew
to
considerable
proportions
with
all
his
business
and
the
improvement
of
odd
moments
in
reading
and
study
he
found
time
to
attend
to
music
and
became
quite
an
accomplished
player
on
the
harp
guitar
and
violin
his
family
and
company
were
often
entertained
by
his
musical
performances
in
franklin
resolved
to
visit
boston
he
had
not
visited
there
for
ten
years
i
must
go
now
he
said
to
his
foreman
because
my
brother
at
newport
is
so
feeble
that
he
is
not
expected
to
live
long
i
shall
stop
at
newport
on
my
way
back
and
when
will
you
return
as
soon
as
possible
it
is
only
a
flying
visit
i
propose
to
make
i
have
some
business
in
boston
and
wish
to
spend
a
little
time
with
my
parents
who
are
getting
old
and
infirm
he
put
every
thing
into
a
good
condition
for
his
foreman
to
handle
in
his
absence
and
then
left
for
boston
where
his
parents
embraced
him
with
tears
of
joy
there
was
no
trace
of
the
boy
left
on
him
now
he
was
a
man
in
the
noblest
sense
of
the
word
necessity
compelled
franklin
to
cut
short
his
visit
and
return
stopping
at
newport
to
see
his
brother
this
was
his
brother
james
the
printer
to
whom
he
was
apprenticed
in
boston
he
had
a
prosperous
printing
business
in
that
town
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
said
james
giving
his
brother
a
cordial
and
tender
welcome
you
find
me
very
feeble
and
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
never
see
you
again
i
hear
of
your
sickness
and
felt
that
i
must
come
to
see
you
at
once
franklin
replied
i
hope
that
your
prospects
are
more
favorable
than
you
appear
to
think
they
are
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
and
short
time
too
my
disease
is
incurable
and
i
am
waiting
for
the
end
we
will
let
be
i
have
only
love
for
you
now
my
dear
brother
you
can
hardly
conceive
how
glad
i
am
to
hear
you
say
that
for
i
cherish
only
the
sincerest
affection
for
you
i
am
truly
sorry
for
any
wrong
i
did
you
in
boston
that
is
all
blotted
out
now
continued
james
i
have
one
request
to
make
and
if
you
can
grant
it
i
shall
be
very
happy
what
is
it
my
son
is
now
ten
years
old
and
the
loss
of
his
father
will
indeed
be
a
great
loss
to
him
i
had
intended
to
instruct
him
in
my
trade
and
after
my
death
i
want
you
should
take
him
to
your
home
in
philadelphia
where
he
can
learn
the
printer
trade
and
when
he
understands
the
business
well
return
him
to
his
mother
and
sisters
who
will
continue
the
printing
house
here
with
all
my
heart
i
will
do
it
and
i
am
glad
to
grant
this
favor
not
only
for
your
sake
but
for
my
own
responded
benjamin
he
shall
be
one
of
my
family
and
i
will
be
to
him
as
a
father
and
he
shall
be
to
me
as
a
son
thus
at
the
grave
side
the
two
brothers
were
thoroughly
reconciled
to
each
other
and
it
was
not
long
before
franklin
had
james
son
in
his
own
family
in
franklin
buried
a
son
four
years
old
a
child
so
bright
and
beautiful
that
strangers
would
stop
on
the
street
to
behold
him
it
was
a
terrible
blow
to
the
parents
he
was
laid
in
christ
church
burying
ground
where
the
defaced
and
headstone
still
bears
this
inscription
francis
son
of
benjamin
and
deborah
franklin
deceased
aged
years
month
and
day
the
delight
of
all
that
knew
him
franklin
proved
a
staunch
friend
of
the
celebrated
george
whitefield
when
he
visited
philadelphia
in
there
was
great
opposition
to
his
work
at
first
one
or
two
pastors
admitted
him
to
their
pulpits
but
the
opposition
grew
so
intense
that
all
the
churches
were
closed
against
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
preach
in
the
fields
franklin
denounced
this
treatment
in
his
paper
and
by
his
voice
in
the
junto
and
on
the
street
you
talk
about
being
called
to
the
work
of
the
ministry
he
said
to
one
of
the
philadelphia
clergy
if
ability
and
great
power
in
the
pulpit
are
evidence
of
being
called
of
god
then
whitefield
must
have
had
a
louder
call
than
any
of
you
but
he
is
very
peculiar
in
his
methods
and
harsh
in
his
treatment
of
sinners
suggested
the
minister
but
if
we
sinners
do
not
object
why
should
you
saints
we
have
heard
him
say
nothing
but
the
truth
yet
all
that
may
be
true
continued
the
preacher
but
so
much
excitement
is
not
healthy
for
the
spiritual
growth
of
the
people
when
did
you
or
any
one
else
ever
see
so
great
moral
and
spiritual
improvement
of
the
people
said
franklin
as
we
have
seen
since
whitefield
has
been
preaching
here
the
whole
population
appears
to
be
thinking
about
religion
excitement
excitement
exclaimed
the
minister
and
when
whitefield
is
gone
there
will
be
a
reaction
and
the
last
state
of
the
people
will
be
worse
than
the
first
so
franklin
supported
whitefield
was
a
constant
attendant
upon
his
ministrations
and
a
lasting
friendship
grew
up
between
them
let
us
put
up
a
building
for
him
to
preach
in
now
that
he
is
excluded
from
the
churches
proposed
franklin
to
a
number
of
whitefield
friends
who
were
discussing
the
situation
a
preacher
of
so
much
power
and
should
be
sustained
a
capital
suggestion
answered
one
of
the
number
and
you
are
the
man
to
carry
the
measure
into
effect
a
rough
building
is
all
that
is
necessary
for
our
purpose
the
finish
will
be
in
the
preaching
added
franklin
a
preacher
of
any
denomination
whatever
who
comes
here
to
instruct
the
people
without
money
and
without
price
should
be
provided
with
a
place
for
worship
yes
even
if
the
mufti
of
constantinople
were
to
send
a
missionary
here
i
would
provide
a
place
for
him
to
hold
forth
and
not
turn
him
into
the
street
responded
coleman
i
will
announce
in
the
at
once
what
our
purpose
is
and
call
a
meeting
continued
franklin
the
announcement
will
test
the
feelings
of
the
people
on
the
subject
let
it
be
done
in
a
hurry
too
said
coleman
public
sentiment
is
ripe
for
something
now
and
i
think
the
citizens
will
endorse
the
scheme
the
project
was
announced
a
meeting
called
and
subscriptions
obtained
with
little
effort
to
erect
a
building
one
hundred
feet
long
and
seventy
wide
in
an
almost
incredibly
short
time
the
house
of
worship
was
completed
and
whitefield
occupied
it
xxxiv
more
honors
and
more
work
franklin
in
was
chosen
clerk
of
the
general
assembly
and
in
appointed
postmaster
of
philadelphia
the
first
position
assured
him
all
the
government
printing
and
introduced
him
to
influential
men
who
would
very
naturally
become
the
patrons
of
his
printing
house
the
second
position
was
of
great
value
to
his
newspaper
as
it
facilitated
the
correspondence
that
improved
it
and
increased
its
circulation
quite
largely
thus
making
it
a
source
of
considerable
income
members
of
the
junto
were
as
much
pleased
with
his
promotion
as
franklin
himself
we
are
not
at
all
surprised
said
coleman
to
colonel
spotswood
we
are
familiar
with
franklin
i
mean
we
members
of
the
junto
as
no
other
persons
are
he
will
fill
ably
any
position
you
can
give
him
that
was
my
estimate
of
the
man
answered
spotswood
who
was
and
so
i
appointed
him
my
deputy
here
from
all
i
could
learn
of
him
i
thought
he
would
be
exact
in
his
way
of
doing
business
and
reporting
to
the
government
his
predecessor
was
careless
and
even
neglectful
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
any
sort
of
a
report
from
him
you
will
find
no
trouble
with
franklin
on
that
score
rejoined
coleman
he
is
one
of
the
most
exact
men
i
ever
knew
and
his
judgment
is
remarkable
for
one
of
his
years
he
appears
to
succeed
in
whatever
he
undertakes
because
of
his
sound
judgment
and
great
capacity
for
work
his
appointment
as
postmaster
of
philadelphia
gives
great
satisfaction
i
thought
it
would
continued
spotswood
the
position
should
be
occupied
by
a
wise
man
who
challenges
public
confidence
and
respect
and
franklin
is
the
wisest
man
i
ever
knew
interjected
coleman
we
see
him
in
this
role
in
the
junto
as
men
outside
do
not
for
he
lays
before
us
his
plans
and
reads
important
articles
that
he
writes
on
various
subjects
for
criticism
before
they
are
published
he
has
just
read
a
paper
on
the
exposing
the
worthlessness
of
the
present
system
and
proposing
a
remedy
also
another
paper
on
establishing
a
for
the
town
when
made
public
both
of
these
measures
will
commend
themselves
to
the
people
the
discussion
over
the
and
in
the
junto
was
both
animated
and
instructive
both
projects
were
entirely
new
and
were
born
of
franklin
fertile
brain
the
most
cumbersome
and
awkward
arrangement
i
ever
heard
of
said
franklin
in
the
junto
to
have
the
constable
of
each
ward
in
turn
summon
to
his
aid
several
housekeepers
for
the
night
and
such
ragamuffins
as
most
of
them
summon
to
their
assistance
a
glass
of
grog
will
enlist
some
of
them
for
a
whole
night
remarked
parsons
i
think
the
town
is
safer
without
any
watchmen
unless
more
responsible
men
can
be
employed
of
course
it
is
responded
coleman
the
six
shillings
paid
annually
to
the
constable
by
each
man
who
does
not
wish
to
serve
is
a
corruption
fund
the
constable
can
pocket
of
it
and
with
the
other
fourth
he
can
employ
the
irresponsible
characters
he
does
i
wonder
the
people
do
rebel
that
is
not
all
nor
the
worst
remarked
breintnal
a
poor
widow
with
less
than
fifty
pounds
to
her
name
must
pay
the
six
shillings
just
as
the
wealthiest
citizen
with
thousands
of
pounds
in
his
own
right
does
it
is
very
unjust
and
my
plan
removes
all
of
these
difficulties
and
burdens
added
franklin
i
propose
to
hire
suitable
men
whose
business
shall
be
to
watch
at
night
levying
a
tax
to
pay
for
the
same
in
proportion
to
property
a
man
who
makes
it
his
business
to
watch
is
worth
much
more
than
one
who
occasionally
serves
under
the
present
system
franklin
ventilated
the
subject
in
the
eliciting
remarks
pro
and
con
gradually
educating
the
people
and
finally
after
several
years
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
plan
adopted
franklin
was
the
author
of
the
system
of
our
land
his
paper
on
the
frequency
of
fires
from
carelessness
and
accidents
with
suggestions
as
to
preventing
them
and
also
extinguishing
them
elicited
equal
interest
in
the
junto
your
suggestion
to
organize
a
company
to
extinguish
fires
is
a
capital
one
remarked
potts
after
listening
to
franklin
paper
it
is
not
only
practical
but
it
can
be
done
very
easily
every
citizen
must
appreciate
the
measure
if
i
understand
the
plan
remarked
maugridge
each
member
will
be
obliged
to
keep
several
leathern
buckets
in
order
for
instant
use
and
strong
bags
for
receiving
goods
to
be
conveyed
to
a
place
of
safety
will
be
provided
yes
and
the
members
must
be
so
well
organized
and
drilled
that
when
a
fire
breaks
out
each
will
know
just
what
to
do
added
franklin
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
members
of
the
company
to
meet
monthly
or
oftener
to
exchange
views
and
make
suggestions
as
to
the
best
way
of
conducting
the
organization
experience
will
teach
us
very
much
how
many
members
should
the
organization
embrace
inquired
scull
that
is
immaterial
replied
coleman
a
large
or
small
number
can
be
used
to
advantage
i
should
say
the
company
must
not
be
too
large
responded
franklin
i
should
think
that
thirty
members
would
be
as
many
as
could
work
to
advantage
if
double
that
number
desire
to
become
members
it
would
be
better
to
organize
two
companies
to
work
in
different
wards
and
how
about
money
ca
maintain
such
an
organization
without
money
suggested
potts
we
can
raise
money
for
the
outfit
of
leathern
buckets
and
bags
by
subscription
replied
franklin
and
we
can
impose
a
fine
upon
members
for
being
absent
from
meetings
then
why
is
not
the
whole
subject
fairly
before
us
remarked
coleman
i
move
that
we
proceed
to
organize
a
of
thirty
members
at
once
coleman
proposition
was
adopted
unanimously
franklin
discussed
the
plan
in
the
and
all
the
members
of
the
junto
worked
hard
for
it
outside
within
a
short
time
the
first
company
was
organized
then
another
and
another
the
good
work
continuing
until
a
large
part
of
the
in
town
belonged
to
and
this
method
continued
until
the
invention
of
and
ladders
with
other
modern
implements
to
assist
in
extinguishing
fires
franklin
was
the
originator
of
it
is
high
time
that
our
people
were
thinking
of
paving
the
streets
said
franklin
at
a
meeting
of
the
junto
it
will
facilitate
cleaning
them
wonderfully
you
must
give
us
a
paper
on
the
subject
and
write
it
up
in
the
replied
parsons
people
must
be
enlightened
before
they
will
adopt
the
measure
the
mass
of
them
know
nothing
about
it
now
you
are
right
responded
franklin
and
it
will
take
a
good
while
to
enlighten
them
the
expense
of
the
measure
will
frighten
them
how
expensive
will
such
a
measure
be
what
does
paving
cost
a
square
yard
i
am
not
able
to
say
now
i
have
not
examined
that
part
of
it
yet
but
i
shall
i
will
prepare
a
paper
for
the
junto
at
the
earliest
possible
date
franklin
had
canvassed
the
subject
considerably
before
he
introduced
it
to
the
members
of
the
junto
in
wet
weather
the
mud
in
the
streets
was
trodden
into
a
quagmire
and
quantities
of
it
carried
on
the
feet
into
stores
and
houses
in
dry
weather
the
wind
blew
the
abundance
of
dust
into
the
faces
and
eyes
of
pedestrians
and
into
the
doors
and
windows
of
dwellings
and
shops
in
his
paper
read
at
the
junto
franklin
set
forth
these
discomforts
with
others
and
showed
how
the
evil
would
be
remedied
by
pavement
the
members
of
the
junto
were
unanimous
in
supporting
his
views
from
week
to
week
he
discussed
the
subject
in
the
literally
giving
line
upon
line
and
precept
upon
precept
nor
did
he
seem
to
make
much
of
an
impression
for
many
months
but
finally
a
strip
of
brick
pavement
having
been
laid
down
the
middle
of
jersey
market
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
street
leading
thereto
paved
now
i
have
a
project
to
enlist
citizens
in
paving
all
the
streets
he
said
at
the
junto
i
have
hired
a
poor
man
to
sweep
the
pavement
now
laid
and
keep
it
as
clean
and
neat
as
a
pin
that
citizens
may
see
for
themselves
the
great
benefit
of
paving
the
streets
that
is
practical
exclaimed
coleman
you
are
always
practical
franklin
and
you
will
make
a
success
of
that
i
expect
to
succeed
after
two
or
three
weeks
i
shall
address
a
circular
to
all
housekeepers
enjoying
the
advantages
of
the
pavement
asking
them
to
join
with
me
in
paying
a
sixpence
each
per
month
to
keep
the
pavement
clean
a
a
month
only
responded
potts
who
had
listened
to
franklin
plan
is
that
all
it
will
cost
yes
that
is
all
and
i
think
that
all
will
be
surprised
that
the
work
can
be
done
for
that
price
and
for
that
reason
they
will
readily
join
in
the
measure
franklin
went
forward
with
his
enterprise
and
every
citizen
appealed
to
accepted
his
proposition
and
out
of
it
grew
a
general
interest
to
pave
the
streets
of
the
city
franklin
drafted
a
bill
to
be
presented
to
the
general
assembly
authorizing
the
work
to
be
done
and
through
the
influence
of
another
party
the
bill
was
amended
by
a
provision
for
lighting
the
streets
at
the
same
time
all
of
which
was
agreeable
to
franklin
here
again
we
see
that
franklin
was
the
originator
of
another
method
of
adding
to
the
comfort
and
beauty
of
cities
and
large
towns
i
will
read
you
a
paper
upon
smoky
chimneys
remarked
franklin
at
the
junto
as
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
written
document
smoky
chimneys
ejaculated
grace
i
wonder
what
will
command
your
attention
next
a
fruitful
theme
though
i
never
expected
we
should
discuss
it
here
it
is
indeed
a
fruitful
theme
responded
franklin
for
more
chimneys
carry
some
of
the
smoke
into
the
room
than
carry
the
whole
out
of
the
top
and
nobody
can
tell
why
i
had
supposed
it
was
because
masons
do
not
understand
the
philosophy
of
remarked
coleman
that
is
it
exactly
the
subject
is
not
understood
at
all
because
it
has
not
been
examined
men
build
chimneys
as
they
do
not
because
they
know
it
is
the
best
way
but
because
they
do
not
know
any
thing
about
it
for
instance
nearly
every
one
thinks
that
smoke
is
lighter
than
air
when
the
reverse
is
true
i
always
had
that
idea
remarked
potts
not
because
i
knew
that
it
was
but
somehow
i
got
that
impression
but
let
us
have
your
paper
and
then
we
will
discuss
it
franklin
read
his
paper
which
was
more
elaborate
and
exhaustive
than
any
thing
of
the
kind
ever
published
at
that
time
it
named
several
definite
causes
of
smoky
chimneys
and
furnished
a
remedy
for
each
what
is
still
more
remarkable
it
suggested
a
plan
of
a
or
stove
that
might
remedy
the
smoking
evil
of
some
chimneys
and
save
much
fuel
in
all
subsequently
he
invented
what
is
known
as
the
franklin
stove
or
though
it
was
sometimes
called
the
pennsylvania
stove
it
was
regarded
as
a
very
useful
invention
and
for
many
years
was
in
general
use
apply
for
a
patent
on
your
stove
suggested
coleman
there
is
much
money
in
it
and
you
ought
to
have
it
if
any
one
not
i
responded
franklin
i
am
not
a
believer
in
patents
if
the
invention
is
a
real
public
benefit
the
people
should
have
the
advantage
of
it
nonsense
retorted
coleman
no
one
but
you
harbors
such
an
idea
i
do
not
see
why
a
man
should
not
receive
pay
for
his
invention
as
much
as
another
does
for
a
day
work
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
inventor
should
not
give
the
public
the
benefit
of
it
if
he
chooses
answered
franklin
governor
thomas
offered
to
give
me
a
patent
on
it
but
i
told
him
this
as
we
enjoy
great
advantages
from
the
invention
of
others
we
should
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
serve
others
by
any
invention
of
ours
and
this
we
should
do
freely
and
generously
and
nobody
will
ever
thank
you
for
it
added
coleman
i
do
ask
them
to
thank
me
for
it
i
give
it
to
them
without
asking
one
for
it
replied
franklin
who
was
in
a
very
happy
mood
well
added
coleman
the
more
i
see
of
you
the
more
i
am
satisfied
that
there
is
but
one
ben
franklin
in
these
parts
in
brief
we
may
add
here
that
franklin
presented
the
model
to
a
member
of
the
junto
robert
grace
who
run
a
furnace
and
for
many
years
he
found
the
casting
of
the
plates
for
these
stoves
a
profitable
thing
still
another
enterprise
which
franklin
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
junto
was
the
founding
of
an
academy
or
university
for
the
higher
education
of
youth
he
wrote
often
and
much
for
the
upon
doing
more
for
the
education
of
the
young
at
last
he
prepared
and
printed
a
pamphlet
entitled
proposals
relating
to
the
education
of
youth
in
pennsylvania
it
was
published
at
his
own
expense
and
gratuitously
distributed
after
it
had
been
read
in
the
junto
where
he
disclosed
his
purpose
it
is
the
greatest
enterprise
you
have
conceived
yet
remarked
parsons
after
listening
to
the
paper
and
it
will
be
the
most
difficult
one
to
push
forward
to
success
i
think
five
thousand
pounds
is
a
great
amount
of
money
to
raise
said
breintnal
i
should
not
want
to
be
the
one
to
raise
it
i
should
if
i
could
retorted
franklin
to
be
the
author
of
so
great
a
blessing
to
the
young
is
pay
enough
without
any
salary
at
any
rate
that
is
all
the
pay
any
man
will
get
for
such
service
do
you
propose
to
raise
the
money
yourself
inquired
coleman
chiefly
i
expect
that
interested
parties
may
assist
on
that
line
the
fact
that
the
enterprise
is
to
bless
their
own
children
gives
me
access
to
them
at
once
first
of
all
however
i
propose
to
send
this
pamphlet
printed
to
a
long
list
of
persons
upon
whom
i
shall
call
for
aid
after
ample
time
for
them
to
read
and
digest
it
has
elapsed
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
franklin
successfully
prosecuted
his
purpose
raised
all
the
money
necessary
and
the
academy
was
founded
scholars
multiplied
so
rapidly
that
larger
quarters
were
soon
demanded
and
now
came
into
use
the
building
which
franklin
caused
to
be
erected
for
the
use
of
rev
whitefield
with
some
alterations
it
was
just
the
building
necessary
to
meet
the
wants
of
the
popular
institution
franklin
was
glad
when
he
secured
the
building
for
whitefield
but
he
was
more
glad
now
because
it
could
be
used
for
the
university
of
philadelphia
as
his
school
was
named
afterwards
perhaps
the
junto
did
not
give
attention
to
a
more
important
measure
in
its
whole
history
than
that
of
establishing
militia
for
public
security
franklin
read
a
paper
having
the
caption
plain
truth
in
which
he
expatiated
upon
the
defenseless
condition
of
pennsylvania
that
while
new
england
was
all
aglow
with
enthusiasm
for
armed
defense
against
foreign
invasion
and
some
of
the
southern
colonies
as
well
pennsylvania
was
utterly
defenseless
there
is
not
a
battery
fort
or
gun
on
the
banks
of
the
delaware
he
said
not
a
volunteer
company
in
the
whole
province
and
what
is
still
more
alarming
not
guns
enough
to
arm
one
our
people
do
believe
in
resistance
you
know
responded
coleman
quaker
influence
is
decidedly
against
and
batteries
and
that
is
the
trouble
retorted
franklin
the
legislatures
of
other
provinces
have
established
public
defenses
but
the
quaker
influence
in
the
assembly
of
pennsylvania
has
defeated
every
measure
of
the
kind
and
will
continue
to
do
so
until
a
french
privateer
seizes
and
sacks
this
town
as
one
could
very
easily
added
parsons
or
a
tribe
of
savages
so
easily
set
on
by
french
politicians
shall
plunder
and
burn
us
added
franklin
but
john
penn
and
thomas
penn
are
not
quakers
like
their
father
i
have
been
told
remarked
potts
and
certainly
the
province
has
not
had
quaker
governors
that
is
very
true
but
so
many
of
the
people
are
quakers
that
the
assembly
is
under
their
control
answered
franklin
but
i
think
the
appearance
of
a
privateer
in
the
river
or
an
attack
by
a
band
of
savages
would
knock
the
out
of
many
of
them
nothing
short
of
that
will
responded
coleman
but
franklin
plan
of
raising
a
volunteer
militia
and
all
necessary
funds
by
subscription
will
not
call
out
any
opposition
from
them
i
believe
that
many
of
them
will
be
glad
to
have
such
defense
if
they
are
not
expected
to
engage
in
it
it
is
not
true
even
now
that
all
the
quakers
oppose
defensive
war
for
some
of
them
do
not
they
have
told
me
so
continued
franklin
they
oppose
aggressive
warfare
but
let
a
privateer
come
up
the
river
or
savages
attack
our
town
and
they
will
fight
for
their
homes
as
hard
as
any
of
us
but
how
do
you
propose
to
reach
the
public
and
interest
them
in
your
plan
inquired
maugridge
i
shall
publish
the
paper
i
have
read
with
some
additions
suggested
by
our
discussion
and
distribute
it
freely
throughout
the
town
at
the
same
time
i
shall
discuss
it
in
the
and
appeal
to
quakers
themselves
on
bible
grounds
to
for
the
public
defense
and
when
they
have
had
time
to
read
the
pamphlet
and
weigh
the
proposition
i
shall
call
a
public
meeting
wise
again
franklin
answered
coleman
who
was
delighted
with
the
plan
your
scheme
will
work
to
a
charm
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
but
just
what
will
you
do
at
your
public
meeting
organize
an
for
defense
after
i
have
harangued
the
audience
upon
the
perils
of
the
hour
i
shall
urge
every
man
present
as
he
values
his
home
and
life
to
join
the
league
of
whatever
sect
or
party
each
man
to
arm
himself
at
his
own
expense
i
suppose
inquired
grace
as
far
as
possible
answered
franklin
and
to
raise
money
for
a
battery
i
have
thought
of
a
lottery
lotteries
were
generally
resorted
to
at
that
day
for
raising
money
that
scheme
for
raising
a
battery
will
succeed
too
said
coleman
with
a
smile
i
can
not
see
why
the
whole
thing
will
not
carry
the
public
by
storm
the
plan
of
franklin
succeeded
beyond
the
most
sanguine
expectations
his
pamphlet
and
articles
in
the
moved
the
public
to
great
enthusiasm
when
the
public
meeting
was
called
there
was
a
general
rush
to
it
it
was
held
in
the
large
building
erected
for
rev
whitefield
and
it
was
filled
to
overflowing
twelve
hundred
men
joined
the
association
for
public
defense
on
that
night
and
the
number
was
increased
to
ten
thousand
within
a
few
days
within
a
few
weeks
eighty
companies
were
organized
in
the
province
armed
and
drilled
ready
to
march
to
any
point
of
danger
at
a
moment
warning
the
companies
in
philadelphia
united
to
form
a
regiment
and
franklin
was
elected
colonel
an
honor
which
he
declined
because
he
considered
himself
unfit
and
recommended
a
lawrence
who
was
a
prominent
and
influential
citizen
the
lottery
scheme
succeeded
also
and
eighteen
cannon
were
borrowed
of
the
governor
of
new
york
until
the
authorities
could
import
the
requisite
number
from
england
not
a
few
quakers
approved
of
these
measures
for
the
public
defense
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
franklin
intensified
the
feeling
by
inducing
the
governor
to
appoint
a
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
such
a
day
had
never
been
observed
in
pennsylvania
and
so
the
governor
and
his
associates
were
too
ignorant
of
the
measure
to
undertake
it
alone
hence
franklin
who
was
familiar
with
fast
days
in
massachusetts
wrote
the
proclamation
for
the
governor
and
secured
the
of
ministers
in
the
observance
of
the
day
it
is
claimed
that
quakers
often
lent
their
influence
to
defensive
warfare
in
an
indirect
manner
as
for
example
when
the
assembly
made
appropriations
for
the
army
for
the
purchase
of
bread
flour
wheat
and
the
latter
phrase
covered
perhaps
this
suggested
to
franklin
when
trying
to
get
an
appropriation
through
the
assembly
the
following
remark
if
we
fail
let
us
move
the
purchase
of
a
with
the
money
the
quakers
can
have
no
objection
to
that
and
then
if
you
nominate
me
and
i
you
as
a
committee
for
that
purpose
we
will
buy
a
great
gun
which
is
certainly
a
the
fears
of
the
colonists
were
allayed
and
these
warlike
preparations
discontinued
when
the
peace
of
was
declared
and
signed
by
the
british
commissioners
xxxv
philosopher
and
statesman
i
have
a
proposition
to
make
to
you
an
important
one
remarked
franklin
to
david
hall
who
had
worked
for
him
four
years
come
into
the
office
and
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
hall
followed
him
into
the
office
wondering
what
the
proposition
could
be
when
they
were
seated
franklin
continued
i
must
have
a
partner
in
this
business
and
i
think
you
are
just
the
man
i
want
if
we
can
agree
upon
the
terms
i
desire
to
be
released
from
the
care
of
the
printing
office
that
i
may
pursue
my
scientific
studies
more
thoroughly
and
satisfactorily
your
proposition
is
very
unexpected
to
me
and
i
feel
very
much
flattered
by
it
answered
hall
but
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
for
i
have
no
capital
to
put
into
the
business
and
you
need
none
interrupted
franklin
my
plan
is
that
you
take
the
office
just
as
it
is
pay
me
one
thousand
pounds
a
year
for
eighteen
years
releasing
me
from
all
care
of
the
business
and
at
the
close
of
eighteen
years
the
whole
business
shall
be
yours
without
further
consideration
well
i
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
that
offer
if
you
are
it
is
certainly
a
generous
one
and
i
shall
accept
it
and
you
will
get
out
of
it
three
or
four
times
the
amount
of
your
present
salary
every
year
suggested
franklin
i
mean
it
shall
be
a
profitable
enterprise
for
you
for
your
long
service
here
has
satisfied
me
that
you
are
the
partner
i
want
this
plan
was
carried
into
effect
and
franklin
was
no
longer
obliged
to
visit
the
printing
office
daily
whither
he
had
been
for
over
twenty
years
his
printing
and
newspaper
business
had
been
very
profitable
so
that
he
was
comparatively
wealthy
for
that
day
his
investments
had
proved
fortunate
and
these
with
the
thousand
pounds
annually
from
hall
and
five
hundred
pounds
from
two
public
offices
he
held
gave
him
an
annual
income
of
about
fifteen
thousand
dollars
which
was
large
for
those
times
one
hundred
and
forty
years
ago
now
i
can
pursue
my
studies
to
my
heart
content
franklin
said
to
his
wife
i
have
only
had
fragments
of
time
to
devote
to
electricity
and
other
studies
hitherto
but
now
i
can
command
time
enough
to
make
research
an
object
i
am
very
glad
that
you
are
able
to
make
so
favorable
arrangements
franklin
replied
you
have
had
altogether
too
much
on
your
hands
for
ten
years
and
more
you
ought
to
have
less
care
and
i
have
an
intense
desire
to
investigate
science
especially
electricity
franklin
continued
i
see
a
wide
field
for
research
and
usefulness
before
me
but
i
have
time
enough
to
prosecute
my
plans
franklin
was
years
old
at
this
time
and
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
his
career
as
a
philosopher
did
not
begin
really
until
he
had
passed
his
fortieth
birthday
but
from
the
time
he
was
released
from
the
care
of
the
printing
office
his
advancement
in
science
was
rapid
his
fame
spread
abroad
both
in
this
country
and
europe
so
that
in
a
few
years
he
became
one
of
the
most
renowned
philosophers
in
the
world
in
a
former
chapter
we
described
his
experiment
with
a
kite
to
prove
that
lightning
and
the
electric
fluid
are
identical
and
this
discovery
established
his
fame
as
the
greatest
electrician
of
the
world
the
royal
society
of
london
elected
him
a
member
by
a
unanimous
vote
and
the
next
year
bestowed
upon
him
the
copley
medal
yale
college
conferred
upon
him
the
degree
of
master
of
arts
and
harvard
university
did
the
same
suddenly
franklin
found
himself
the
most
conspicuous
character
in
american
history
a
philosopher
of
the
most
honored
type
mignet
said
of
him
thus
all
at
once
distinguished
the
philadelphia
sage
became
the
object
of
universal
regard
and
was
abundantly
loaded
with
academic
honors
the
academy
of
sciences
of
paris
made
him
an
associate
member
as
it
had
newton
and
leibnitz
all
the
learned
bodies
of
europe
eagerly
admitted
him
into
their
ranks
kant
the
celebrated
german
philosopher
called
him
prometheus
of
modern
times
to
this
scientific
glory
which
he
might
have
extended
if
he
had
consecrated
to
his
favorite
pursuits
his
thoughts
and
his
time
he
added
high
political
distinction
to
this
man
happy
because
he
was
intelligent
great
because
he
had
an
active
genius
and
a
devoted
heart
was
accorded
the
rare
felicity
of
serving
his
country
skilfully
and
usefully
for
a
period
of
fifty
years
and
after
having
taken
rank
among
the
immortal
founders
of
the
positive
sciences
of
enrolling
himself
among
the
generous
liberators
of
the
nations
a
few
years
later
the
three
universities
of
andrew
oxford
and
edinburgh
conferred
upon
him
the
degree
of
doctor
of
laws
europe
vied
with
america
in
tributes
of
honor
and
praise
his
electrical
experiments
made
him
the
author
of
several
useful
inventions
among
which
the
lightning
rod
was
the
foremost
it
came
into
general
use
not
only
in
our
country
but
also
in
europe
the
celebrated
kinnersley
wrote
to
him
may
this
method
of
security
from
the
destructive
violence
of
one
of
the
most
awful
powers
of
nature
meet
with
such
further
success
as
to
induce
every
good
and
grateful
heart
to
bless
god
for
the
important
discovery
may
the
benefit
thereof
be
diffused
over
the
whole
globe
may
it
extend
to
the
latest
posterity
of
mankind
and
make
the
name
of
franklin
like
that
of
newton
immortal
franklin
did
not
intend
to
continue
in
political
life
when
he
entered
into
partnership
with
hall
and
he
so
announced
to
his
friends
at
that
time
he
had
served
as
councilman
in
the
city
been
a
member
of
the
general
assembly
acted
as
commissioner
on
several
important
occasions
and
served
the
public
in
various
other
ways
but
now
he
designed
to
stop
and
devote
himself
entirely
to
scientific
pursuits
within
five
years
however
he
found
himself
more
deeply
involved
in
political
plans
and
labors
than
ever
before
he
was
as
wise
in
statesmanship
as
he
was
in
philosophy
and
the
services
of
such
a
man
were
in
constant
demand
the
following
list
of
public
offices
he
filled
shows
that
he
stood
second
to
no
statesman

the

public

and

of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
like
washington
first
in
war
first
in
peace
and
first
in
the
hearts
of
his
countrymen
thomas
jefferson
john
adams
roger
sherman
and
robert
livingston
were
associated
with
franklin
in
drafting
the
declaration
of
independence
which
congress
adopted
july
the
original
draft
was
by
jefferson
but
it
contained
many
interlineations
in
the
of
franklin
when
they
were
signing
the
memorable
document
after
its
passage
by
congress
john
hancock
remarked
we
must
be
unanimous
we
must
all
hang
together
yes
if
we
would
not
hang
separately
replied
franklin
jefferson
was
viewing
with
evident
disappointment
the
mutilation
of
his
draft
of
the
declaration
in
franklin
when
the
latter
remarked
i
have
made
it
a
rule
whenever
in
my
power
to
avoid
becoming
the
draftsman
of
papers
to
be
reviewed
by
a
public
body
i
took
my
lesson
from
an
incident
which
i
will
relate
to
you
when
i
was
a
one
of
my
companions
an
having
served
out
his
time
was
about
to
open
shop
for
himself
his
first
concern
was
to
have
a
handsome
with
a
proper
inscription
he
composed
it
in
these
words
thompson
hatter
makes
and
sells
hats
for
ready
with
a
figure
of
a
hat
subjoined
but
he
thought
he
would
submit
to
his
friends
for
their
amendments
the
first
he
showed
it
to
thought
the
word
tautologous
because
followed
by
the
words
which
showed
he
was
a
hatter
it
was
struck
out
the
next
observed
that
the
word
might
as
well
be
omitted
because
his
customers
would
not
care
who
made
the
hats
if
good
and
to
their
mind
they
would
buy
by
whomsoever
made
he
struck
it
out
a
third
said
he
thought
the
words
ready
were
useless
as
it
was
not
the
custom
of
the
place
to
sell
on
credit
every
one
who
purchased
expected
to
pay
they
were
parted
with
and
the
inscription
now
stood
thompson
sells
hats
says
his
next
friend
nobody
will
expect
you
to
give
them
away
what
then
is
the
use
of
that
word
it
was
stricken
out
and
followed
the
rather
as
there
was
one
painted
on
the
board
so
his
inscription
was
reduced
ultimately
to
with
the
figure
of
a
hat
subjoined
it
is
doubtful
if
american
independence
would
have
been
achieved
when
it
was
but
for
the
services
of
franklin
at
the
court
of
england
his
first
appearance
there
was
when
his
fame
as
a
philosopher
was
at
its
zenith
and
the
greatest
men
of
that
country
sought
his
acquaintance
william
strahan
a
member
of
parliament
wrote
to
franklin
i
never
saw
a
man
who
was
in
every
respect
so
perfectly
agreeable
to
me
some
are
able
in
one
view
some
in
another
he
in
all
the
tories
who
meant
to
keep
the
colonies
in
subjection
and
burden
them
with
taxes
were
the
leaders
in
governmental
affairs
and
the
majority
in
numbers
of
course
the
colonies
could
not
expect
many
favors
from
them
without
the
mediation
of
their
strongest
statesmen
and
franklin
was
the
one
above
all
others
on
whom
they
depended
his
first
diplomatic
career
in
england
when
he
was
the
agent
of
pennsylvania
and
other
colonies
lasted
from
to
he
remained
at
home
only
a
year
and
a
half
when
he
was
appointed
minister
to
england
whither
he
went
in
remaining
there
ten
years
a
long
stormy
period
of
political
troubles
culminating
in
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
american
revolution
we
have
only
to
mention
the
boston
port
bill
the
stamp
act
quartering
british
troops
in
the
public
buildings
of
boston
and
other
measures
which
the
colonies
considered
oppressive
and
even
tyrannical
to
show
the
line
of
franklin
intercession
in
behalf
of
his
countrymen
and
how
they
came
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
bondage
the
tory
hatred
towards
franklin
was
something
fearful
at
times
exceeded
only
by
their
hatred
towards
the
people
whom
he
represented
i
am
willing
to
love
all
mankind
except
an
american
exclaimed
johnson
and
when
rebuked
for
his
unchristian
disposition
his
inflammable
corruption
bursting
into
horrid
fire
says
boswell
he
breathed
out
threatenings
and
slaughter
calling
them
rascals
robbers
pirates
and
exclaiming
that
he
would
burn
and
destroy
them
when
barclay
hinted
to
franklin
that
he
might
have
almost
any
place
of
honor
if
he
would
consent
to
a
certain
line
of
action
our
loyal
hero
spurned
the
bribe
saying
the
ministry
i
am
sure
would
rather
give
me
a
place
in
a
cart
to
tyburn
prison
than
any
other
place
whatever
he
could
neither
be
coaxed
nor
frightened
into
submission
to
the
british
crown
in
february
he
was
summoned
before
the
house
of
commons
where
he
met
the
enemies
of
his
country
face
to
face
and
stood
firm
through
the
searching
examination
will
the
americans
consent
to
pay
the
stamp
duty
if
it
is
lessened
he
was
asked
no
never
unless
compelled
by
force
of
arms
he
answered
may
not
a
military
force
carry
the
stamp
act
into
execution
suppose
a
military
force
sent
into
america
they
will
find
nobody
in
arms
what
are
they
then
to
do
then
can
not
force
a
man
to
take
stamps
who
chooses
to
do
without
them
they
will
not
a
rebellion
they
may
indeed
one
if
the
stamp
act
is
enforced
will
induce
the
americans
to
give
as
much
for
the
worse
manufactures
of
their
own
and
use
them
in
preference
to
our
better
ones
people
will
pay
as
freely
to
gratify
one
passion
as
another
their
resentment
as
their
would
the
people
of
boston
discontinue
their
trade
the
merchants
of
boston
are
a
very
small
number
and
must
discontinue
their
trade
if
nobody
will
buy
their
goods
what
are
the
body
of
the
people
in
the
colonies
they
are
farmers
husbandmen
or
planters
would
they
suffer
the
produce
of
their
lands
to
rot
no
but
they
would
not
raise
so
much
they
would
manufacture
more
and
plow
less
i
do
not
know
a
single
article
imported
into
the
northern
colonies
that
they
can
not
do
without
or
make
themselves
to
lord
kames
he
said
america
must
become
a
great
country
populous
and
mighty
and
will
a
less
time
than
is
generally
be
able
to
shake
off
any
shackles
that
may
be
imposed
upon
her
and
perhaps
place
them
on
the
imposers
but
his
labors
availed
nothing
although
chatham
pitt
burke
fox
and
others
espoused
the
cause
of
the
colonies
affairs
hastened
to
the
crisis
of
and
franklin
returned
to
philadelphia
reaching
that
city
soon
after
the
battles
of
lexington
and
concord
were
fought
in
a
few
months
before
he
left
england
for
america
his
wife
died
her
death
occurred
on
though
the
sad
tidings
did
not
reach
franklin
until
a
short
time
before
he
took
passage
for
home
it
was
at
this
time
that
his
famous
letter
to
his
old
english
friend
william
strahan
was
written
of
which
we
are
able
to
furnish
a
the
scenes
of
the
revolution
followed
through
the
agency
of
franklin
as
minister
plenipotentiary
to
france
the
french
government
formed
an
alliance
with
the
colonies
and
the
eight
years
war
was
waged
to
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
at
yorktown
and
freedom
was
achieved
no
american
exerted
greater
influence
in
securing
the
independence
of
the
colonies
than
franklin
he
was
one
of
the
originators
of
the
continental
congress
and
was
the
author
of
the
plan
for
a
union
of
the
states
on
his
way
to
the
albany
conference
in
he
drew
up
a
plan
of
union
which
he
presented
to
said
conference
composed
of
delegates
from
seven
northern
colonies
other
members
presented
plans
but
his
was
preferred
and
adopted
with
some
amendments
and
commended
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
king
and
parliament
of
england
franklin
plan
of
union
was
substantially
that
which
subsequently
united
the
thirteen
states
into
one
nation
no
name
is
more
conspicuous
in
history
than
that
of
franklin
at
one
time
in
france
prints
medallion
portraits
and
busts
of
him
were
multiplied
throughout
that
country
in
england
the
most
renowned
statesmen
and
scholars
acknowledged
his
abilities
and
praised
his
remarkable
career
in
america
his
statue
was
set
up
in
halls
of
learning
and
legislation
literary
societies
and
institutions
were
founded
in
his
name
and
numerous
towns
were
called
after
him
perhaps
the
author
native
town
franklin
was
the
first
to
appropriate
his
name
a
few
years
thereafter
a
nephew
called
his
attention
to
this
fact
suggesting
that
the
present
of
a
bell
from
him
would
be
very
acceptable
as
the
people
were
erecting
a
house
of
worship
franklin
was
in
passy
france
at
the
time
and
he
immediately
addressed
the
following
letter
to
his
old
friend
price
asking
him
to
select
and
forward
a
library
passy
march
dear
friend
my
nephew
williams
will
have
the
honor
of
delivering
you
this
line
it
is
to
request
from
you
a
list
of
a
few
books
to
the
value
of
about
pounds
such
as
are
most
proper
to
inculcate
principles
of
sound
religion
and
just
government
a
new
town
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
having
done
me
the
honor
of
naming
itself
after
me
and
proposing
to
build
a
steeple
to
their
if
i
would
give
them
a
bell
i
have
advised
the
sparing
themselves
the
expense
of
a
steeple
for
the
present
and
that
they
would
accept
of
books
instead
of
a
bell
sense
being
preferable
to
sound
these
are
therefore
intended
as
the
commencement
of
a
little
parochial
library
for
the
use
of
a
society
of
intelligent
respectable
farmers
such
as
our
country
people
generally
consist
of
besides
your
own
works
i
would
only
mention
on
the
recommendation
of
my
sister
stennett
on
personal
religion
which
may
be
one
book
of
the
number
if
you
know
and
approve
it
with
the
highest
esteem
and
respect
i
am
ever
my
dear
friend
yours
most
affectionately
b
franklin
the
inhabitants
of
franklin
got
instead
of
and
were
never
sorry
doctor
price
in
the
course
of
a
letter
dated
at
newington
green
june
in
which
he
speaks
of
williams
visit
says
i
have
according
to
your
desire
furnished
him
with
a
list
of
such
books
on
religion
and
government
as
i
think
some
of
the
best
and
added
a
present
to
the
parish
that
is
to
bear
your
name
of
such
of
my
own
publications
as
i
think
may
not
be
unsuitable
should
this
be
the
commencement
of
parochial
libraries
in
the
states
it
will
do
great
good
the
books
were
duly
forwarded
to
the
town
of
franklin
the
rev
nathaniel
emmons
clergyman
of
the
parish
for
which
the
library
was
designed
preached
a
sermon
in
commemoration
of
this
bounty
entitled
the
dignity
of
man
a
discourse
addressed
to
the
congregation
in
franklin
upon
the
occasion
of
their
receiving
from
doctor
franklin
the
mark
of
his
respect
in
a
rich
donation
of
books
appropriated
to
the
use
of
a
parish
library
this
sermon
was
printed
in
the
year
with
the
following
dedication
to
his
excellency
benjamin
franklin
president
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
the
ornament
of
genius
the
patron
of
science
and
the
boast
of
man
this
discourse
is
inscribed
with
the
greatest
deference
humility
and
gratitude
by
his
obliged
and
most
humble
servant
the
author
the
library
contained
one
hundred
and
sixteen
volumes
chiefly
relating
to
government
science
and
religion
of
which
about
ninety
volumes
are
still
in
a
good
state
of
preservation
on
the
of
april
franklin
expired
mourned
by
a
grateful
nation
and
honored
by
the
world
for
two
years
he
had
lived
in
anticipation
of
this
event
one
day
he
rose
from
his
bed
saying
to
his
daughter
make
up
my
bed
that
i
may
die
in
a
decent
manner
i
hope
father
that
you
will
yet
recover
and
live
many
years
replied
his
daughter
i
hope
not
was
his
answer
when
told
to
change
his
position
in
bed
that
he
might
breathe
more
easily
he
replied
a
dying
man
can
do
nothing
easy
his
sufferings
were
so
great
as
to
extort
a
groan
from
him
at
one
time
whereupon
he
said
i
fear
that
i
do
not
bear
pain
as
i
ought
it
is
designed
no
doubt
to
wean
me
from
the
world
in
which
i
am
no
longer
competent
to
act
my
part
to
a
clerical
friend
who
witnessed
one
of
his
paroxysms
as
he
was
about
to
retire
he
said
oh
no
do
go
away
these
pains
will
soon
be
over
they
are
for
my
good
and
besides
what
are
the
pains
of
a
moment
in
comparison
with
the
pleasures
of
eternity
he
had
a
picture
of
christ
on
the
cross
placed
so
that
he
could
look
at
it
as
he
lay
on
his
bed
that
is
the
picture
of
one
who
came
into
the
world
to
teach
men
to
love
one
another
he
remarked
his
last
look
as
he
passed
away
was
cast
upon
that
painting
of
christ
in
a
codicil
to
his
will
was
this
bequest
my
fine
with
a
gold
head
curiously
wrought
in
the
form
of
a
cap
of
liberty
i
give
to
my
friend
and
the
friend
of
mankind
if
it
were
a
sceptre
he
has
merited
it
and
would
become
it
philanthropist
scholar
philosopher
statesman
were
the
titles
won
by
the
boston
printer
boy
