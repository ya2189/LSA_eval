garden
all
about
us
well
worth
knowing
for
flowers
have
distinct
objects
in
life
and
are
everything
they
are
for
the
most
justifiable
of
reasons
the
perpetuation
and
the
improvement
of
their
species
the
means
they
employ
to
accomplish
these
ends
are
so
various
and
so
consummately
clever
that
in
learning
to
understand
them
we
are
brought
to
realize
how
similar
they
are
to
the
fundamental
aims
of
even
the
human
race
indeed
there
are
few
life
principles
that
plants
have
not
worked
out
satisfactorily
the
problems
of
adapting
oneself
to
one
environment
of
insuring
healthy
families
of
starting
one
children
well
in
life
of
founding
new
colonies
in
distant
lands
of
the
cooperative
method
of
conducting
business
as
opposed
to
the
individualistic
of
laying
up
treasure
in
the
bank
for
future
use
of
punishing
vice
and
rewarding
virtue
these
and
many
other
problems
of
mankind
the
flowers
have
worked
out
with
the
help
of
insects
through
the
ages
to
really
understand
what
the
wild
flowers
are
doing
what
the
scheme
of
each
one
is
besides
looking
beautiful
is
to
give
one
a
broader
sympathy
with
both
man
and
nature
and
to
add
a
real
interest
and
joy
to
life

quite
as

a
picture
and
happily
far
more
approachable
in

indeed
one
of
the
comforts
of
botany
as
compared
with
bird
study
is
that
we
may
get
close
enough
to
the
flowers
to
observe
their
last
detail
whereas
the
bird
we
have
followed
laboriously
over
hill
and
dale
through
briers
and
swamps
darts
away
beyond
the
range
of
with
tantalizing
swiftness
while
no

plant
is
yet
thoroughly
known
to

in

of
the
years
of

devoted
by
specialists
to

the
inner
meaning
of
the
humblest
wayside
weed
any
plant
which
elects
to
grow
in
shallow
water
must
be
amphibious
it
must
be
able
to
breathe
beneath
the
surface
as
the
fish
do
and
also
be
adapted
to
thrive
without
those
parts
that
correspond
to
gills
for
ponds
and
streams
have
an
unpleasant
way
of
drying
up
in
summer
leaving
it
stranded
on
the
shore
this
accounts
in
part
for
the
variable
leaves
on
the
those
underneath
the
water

long

to

are
the

those
with

lines
sterile
within
are
smooth
glossy
columns
and
near

shall
find

or

seated

if
jack
elaborate
plan

complete
plants
may
be
detected
in
process
of
evolution
toward
their
ideals
just
as
nations
and
men
are
doubtless
when
jack
mechanism
is
perfected
his
guilt
will
disappear
a
little
way
above
the
florets
the
club
enlarges
abruptly
forming
a
projecting
ledge
that
effectually
closes
the
avenue
of
escape
for
many
a
guileless
victim
a
fungous
gnat
enticed
perhaps
by
the
striped
house
of
refuge
from
cold
spring
winds
and
with
a
prospect
of
food
below
enters
and
slides
down
the
inside
walls
or
the
slippery
colored
column
in
either
case
descent
is
very
easy
it
is
the
return
that
is
made
so
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
the
tiny
visitors
squeezing
past
the
projecting
ledge
the
gnat
finds
himself
in
a
roomy
apartment
whose
floor
the
bottom
of
the
pulpit
is
dusted
over
with
fine
pollen
that
is
if
he
is
among
staminate
flowers
already
mature
to
get
some
of
that
pollen
with
which
the
gnat
presently
covers
himself
transferred
to
the
minute
pistillate
florets
waiting
for
it
in
a
distant
chamber
is
of
course
jack
whole
aim
in
enticing
visitors
within
his
polished
walls
but
what
means
are
provided
for
their
escape
their
efforts
to
crawl
upward
over
the
slippery
surface
only
land
them
weak
and
discouraged
where
they
started
the
projecting
ledge
overhead
prevents
them
from
using
their
wings
the
passage
between
the
ledge
and
the
spathe
is
far
too
narrow
to
permit
flight
now
if
a
gnat
be
persevering
he
will
presently
discover
a
gap
in
the
flap
where
the
spathe
folds
together
in
front
and
through
this
tiny
opening
he
makes
his
escape
only
to
enter
another
pulpit
like
the
trusted
but
too
trusting
messenger
he
is
and
leave
some
of
the
vitalizing
pollen
on
the
fertile
florets
awaiting
his
coming
but
suppose
the
fly
small
as
he
is
is
too
large
to
work
his
way
out
through
the
flap
or
too
bewildered
or
stupid
to
find
the
opening
or
too
exhausted
after
his
futile
efforts
to
get
out
through
the
overhead
route
to
persevere
or
too
weak
with
hunger
in
case
of
long
detention
in
a
pistillate
trap
where
no
pollen
is
what
then
open
a
dozen
of
pulpits
and
in
several
at
least
dead
victims
will
be
found
pathetic
little
corpses
sacrificed
to
the
imperfection
of
his
executive
system
had
the
flies
entered
mature
spathes
whose
walls
had
spread
outward
and
away
from
the
polished
column
flight
through
the
overhead
route
might
have
been
possible
however
glad
we
may
be
to
make
every
due
allowance
for
this
sacrifice
of
the
higher
life
to
the
lower
as
only
a
temporary
imperfection
of
mechanism
incidental
to
the
plant

development

cruelty

us
no
less

it
may
be

will

comes
from

rascally

his
cousin
the
as
is
well
known
destroys
the
winged
messenger
bearing
its
offspring
to
plant
fresh
colonies
in
a
distant
bog

the
decayed
body
of
the

acts
as
the
best
possible

may
strike
its

the

of
a
simple

to
the
novice
one
of
the
most
chastely
beautiful
of
our

the

is

at

one
finds
the

from

according
to
the

of
its
long

perhaps
the
most
strikingly
beautiful
member
of
the
tribe
is
the
painted
trillium
or
at
the
summit
of
the
slender

rising
perhaps
only
eight
inches
or
maybe
twice

this

spreads
its

some

after

have
returned
from
the

the
purple
trillium
unfurls
its
unattractive
flower
in
the
variable
colors
found
in
different
regions
one
can
almost
trace
its
evolution
from
green
white
and
red
to
purple
which
we
are
told
is
the
course
all
flowers
must
follow
to
attain
to
blue
the

forms
however
attractive
to
the
eye
are
never
more
agreeable
to
the
nose
than
the
ones
bees
and
butterflies
with
delicate
appreciation
of
color
and
fragrance
let
the
blossom
alone
since
it
secretes
no
nectar
and
one
would
naturally
infer
either
that
it
can
fertilize
itself
without
insect
aid
a
theory
which
closer
study
of
its
organs
goes
far
to
disprove
or
that
the
so
repellent
to
us
is
in
itself
an
attraction
to
certain
insects
needful
for
which
are
they
beetles
have
been
observed
crawling
over
the
flower
but
without
effecting
any
methodical
result
one
inclines
to
accept
clarence
weed
theory
of
special
adaptation
to
the
common
green
which
would
naturally
be
attracted
to
a
flower
resembling
in
color
and
odor
a
raw
beefsteak
of
uncertain
age
these
little
creatures
seen
in
every
butcher
shop
throughout
the
summer
the
flower
furnishes
with
a
free
lunch
of
pollen
in
consideration
of
the
transportation
of
a
few
grains
to
another
blossom
absence
of
the
usual
floral
attractions
gives
the
carrion
flies
a
practical
monopoly
of
the
pollen
food
which
no
doubt
tastes
as
it
smells
the
whose
dark
purple
or
greenish
blossom
narrower
of
sepal
and
petals
than
the
preceding
is
seated
in
a
whorl
of
three
sometimes
blotched
leaves
possesses
a
rather
pleasant
odor
nevertheless
it
seems
to
have
no
great
attraction
for
insects
the
stigmas
which
are
very
large
almost
touch
the
anthers
surrounding
them
therefore
the
beetles
which
one
frequently
sees
crawling
over
them
to
feed
on
the
pollen
so
jar
them
no
doubt
as
to
the
flower
but
it
is
scarcely
probable
these
slow
crawlers
often
transfer
the
grains
from
one
blossom
to
another
a
degraded
flower
like
this
has
little
need
of
color
and
perfume
one
would
suppose
yet
it
may
be
even
now
slowly
perfecting
its
way
toward
an
ideal
of
which
we
see
a
part
only
complete
in
deep

the

it
would

says
john

that
there
is
a
species
of
smilax
with
an
unsavory
name
that
the
bee
does
not
visit
the
production
of
this
plant
is
a
curious
freak
of
nature
it
would
be
a
cruel
joke
to
offer
it
to
any
person
not
acquainted
with
it
to
smell
it
is
like
the
vent
of
a
thoreau
compared
its
odor
to
that
of
a
dead
rat
in
a
wall
it
is
first
cousin
to
the
trilliums
among
the
prettiest
of
our
native
wild
flowers
continues
burroughs
and
the
same
bad
blood
crops
out
in
the
purple
trillium
or
strange
that
so
close
an
observer
as
burroughs
or
thoreau
should
not
have
credited
the
with
being
something
more
intelligent

a

the

brush
past

leave

some
of

thus
is
effected

darwin
has
shown
how
necessary
this
is
to
insure
the
most
vigorous

beautiful
offspring
without
this
wonderful
adaptation
of
the
flower
to
the
requirements
of
its
insect
friends
and
of
the
insect
to
the
needs
of
the

both
must
perish
the
former
from
hunger
the
latter
because
unable
to
perpetuate

yet

greedily
appropriated
all
the
beauties

scarcely
an

doubtless
the

the

as
is
the

there
is

another

this

that
seems

it

which
vanquish
the

this
has

the

of

has
taken

than
this
the
fissure
down
the

of

slipper
is
not

wide

that
a
bee
must
use
some
force
to
push
against
its
elastic
sloping
sides
and
enter
the
large
banquet
chamber
where
he
finds
generous
entertainment
secreted
among
the
fine
white
hairs
in
the
upper
part
presently
he
has
feasted
enough
now
one
can
hear
him
buzzing
about
inside
trying
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
trap
toward
the
two
little
gleams
of
light
through
apertures
at
the
end
of
a
passage
beyond
the
nectary
hairs
he
at
length
finds
his
way
narrower
and
narrower
grows
the
passage
until
it
would
seem
as
if
he
could
never
struggle
through
nor
can
he
until
his
back
has
rubbed
along
the
sticky
overhanging
stigma
which
is
furnished
with
minute
rigid
sharply
pointed
papillae
all
directed
forward
and
placed
there
for
the
express
purpose
of
combing
out
the
pollen
he
has
brought
from
another
flower
on
his
back
or
head
the
imported
pollen
having
been
safely
removed
he
still
has
to
struggle
on
toward
freedom
through
one
of
the
narrow
openings
where
an
anther
almost
blocks
his
way
as
he
works
outward
this
anther
drawn
downward
on
its
hinge
plasters
his
back
with
yellow
granular
pollen
as
a
parting
gift
and
away
he
flies
to
another

to
have
it
combed
out

the

no

the

in

a
glance
at
the

of
this

one
of
the
handsomest
and
most
striking
of
its

the
heavy
perfume
of

seem
to
indicate
that
only
a

with

could
reach
the
nectar
secreted
at

of

butterflies
attracted
by
the
conspicuous

sometimes
hover
about
the

but
it
is
probable
that
to
secure
a
sip
all
but
possibly
the
very
largest
of
them
must
go
to
the
smaller
orchis
whose
shorter
spur
holds
out
a
certain
prospect
of
reward
for
in
these
two
cases
as
in
so
many
others
the
flower
welcome
for
an

is
in
exact
proportion
to
the

tongue
doubtless
it

one
of

such
as
we
see
at

working
about

deep

perfumed

guide

to
their

that
is

benefactor

of

is
perfectly
adapted
to
its

attracted
by
the
showy
broad
lower
petal
his
wings
ever
in
rapid
motion
the
moth
proceeds
to
unroll
his
proboscis
and
drain
the
cup
that
is
frequently
an
inch
and
a
half
deep
thrusting
in
his
head
either
one
or
both
of
his
large
projecting
eyes
are
pressed
against
the
sticky
discs
to
which
the
pollen
masses
are
attached
by
a
stalk
and
as
he
raises
his
head
to
depart
feeling
that
he
is
caught
he
gives
a
little
jerk
that
detaches
them
and
away
he
flies
with
these
still
fastened
to
his
eyes
even
while
he
is
flying
to
another
flower
that
is
to
say
in
half
a
minute
the
stalks
of
the
pollen
masses
bend
downward
from
the
perpendicular
and
slightly
toward
the
centre
or
just
far
enough
to
require
the
moth
in
thrusting
his
proboscis
into
the
nectary
to
strike
the
glutinous
sticky
stigma
now
withdrawing
his
head
either
or
both
of
the
golden
clubs
he
brought
in
with
him
will
be
left
on
the
precise
spot
where
they
will
fertilize
the
flower
sometimes
but
rarely
we
catch
a
butterfly
or
moth
from
the
smaller
or
larger
purple
orchids
with
a
pollen
mass
attached
to
his
tongue
instead
of
to
his
eyes
this
is
when
he
does
not
make
his
entrance
from
the
exact
centre
as
in
these
flowers
he
is
not
obliged
to
do
and
in
order
to
reach
the
nectary
his
tongue
necessarily
brushes
against
one
of
the
sticky
anther
sacs
the
performance
may
be
successfully
imitated
by
thrusting
some
blunt
point
about
the
size
of
a
moth
head
a
dull
pencil
or
a
into
the
flower
as
an
insect
would
enter
withdraw
the
pencil
and
one
or
both
of
the
pollen
masses
will
be
found
sticking
to
it
and
already
automatically
changing
their
attitude
in
the
case
of
the
large
orchis
whose
flowers
are
fertilized
in
a
similar
manner
by
the
sphinx
moth

anther
sacs
converge
like
little
horns
and
their
change
of
attitude

do

prime
necessity
orchids
have
arrived
at

pinnacle

achievement
that
it

impossible

to
fertilize
themselves

that
some
are
absolutely
sterile

their
own

when
it
is
applied
to
their

artificially
with
insect
aid
however
a
single
plant
has
produced
more
than
seeds
no
wonder
then
that
as
a

they
have
adopted
the
most
marvellous
blandishments
and
mechanism
in
the
whole
floral
kingdom
to
secure
the
visits
of
that
special
insect
to
which
each
is
adapted

having
secured
him

compel

to
do

of
suffocation

we
can
see
the
best
of
reasons
for
orchids
mounting

living
on

to
escape
strangulation

for

in

within

almost

the

of

curiously
enough
never
happens
without

aid

if
a

be
passed
over
it
ever
so
lightly
a
stream
of
sticky
milky
fluid
exudes
hardens
and
the

with

masses
attached
may
be
withdrawn
on

just
as
the
bee
removes
them
with
her
tongue
each
pollinium
consists
of
two
leaves
of
pollen
united
for
about
half
their
length
in
the
middle
with
elastic
threads
as
the
pollinia
are
attached
parallel
to
the

they
stick
parallel
on
the

tongue
yet
she
may
fold
up
her
proboscis
under
her
head
if
she
choose
without
inconvenience
from
the
pollen
masses
or
without
danger
of
loosening
them
now
having
finished
sucking
the
flowers
at
the
top
of
the
spike
away
she
flies
to
an
older
flower
at
the
bottom
of
another
one
here
a
marvellous
thing
has
happened
the
passage
which
when
the
flower
first
expanded
scarcely
permitted
a
bristle
to
pass
has
now
widened
through
the
automatic
downward
movement
of
the
column
in
order
to
expose
the
stigmatic
surfaces
to
contact
with
the
pollen
masses
brought
by
the
bee
without
the
help
this
orchid
with
a
host
of
other
flowers
must
disappear
from
the
face
of
the
earth
so
very
many
species
which
have
lost
the
power
to
fertilize
themselves
now
depend
absolutely
on
these
little
pollen
carriers
it
is
safe
to
say
that
should
the
bees
perish
one
half
our
flora
would
be
exterminated
with
them
on
the
slight
downward
movement
of
the
column
in
the
ladies
tresses
then
as
well
as
on
the
ministrations
the
fertilization
of
the
flower
absolutely
depends
if
the
stigma
of
the
lowest
flower
has
already
been
fully
fertilized
says
darwin
little
or
no
pollen
will
be
left
on
its
dried
surface
but
on
the
next
succeeding
flower
of
which
the
stigma
is
adhesive
large
sheets
of
pollen
will
be
left
then
as
soon
as
the
bee
arrives
near
the
summit
of
the
spike
she
will
withdraw
fresh
pollinia
will
fly
to
the
lower
flowers
on
another
plant
and
fertilize
them
and
thus
as
she
goes
her
rounds
and
adds
to
her
store
of
honey
she
continually
fertilizes
fresh
flowers

of

vulgaris
whose

suggested
the

of

to

linnaeus
when

of

may

nipping

in

where

is
secreted
just
as
they
do
in

and

nectaries
make

butterflies
absolutely
dependent
on
nectar
hover
near
our
showy
wild
columbine
with
its
five
tempting
horns
of
plenty
but
sail
away
again
knowing
as
they
do
that
their
weak
legs
are
not
calculated
to
stand
the
strain
of
an
inverted
position
from
a
pendent
flower
nor
are
their

adapted
to
slender
tubes
unless
these
may
be
entered
from
above
the
tongues
of
both
butterflies
and
moths
bend
readily
only
when
directed
beneath
their
bodies
it
will
be
noticed
that
our
columbine
tubes
contract
just
below
the
point
where
the
nectar
is
secreted
doubtless
to
protect
it
from
small
bees
when
we
see
the
or
the
little
wild
bees
chiefly
on
the
flower
we
may
know
they
get
pollen
only
finally
a
humming
bird
whirs
into
sight
poising
before
a
columbine
and
moving
around
it
to
drain
one
spur
after
another
until
the
five
are
emptied
he
flashes
like
thought
to
another
group
of
inverted
red
cornucopias
visits
in
turn
every
flower
in
the
colony
then
whirs
away
quite
as
suddenly
as
he
came
probably
to
him
and
no
longer
to
the
outgrown
bumblebee
has
the
flower
adapted
itself
the
european
species

blue
the

favorite
color
according
to
sir
john
lubbock
the
nectar
hidden
in
its
spurs
which
are
shorter
stouter
and
curved
is
accessible
only
to
the
largest
bumblebees
there
are
no
humming
birds
in
europe
our
native
columbine
on
the
contrary
has
longer
contracted
straight
erect
spurs
most
easily
drained
by
the
which
like
eugene
field
ever
delights
in
any
color
at
all
so
long
as
it
red
to
help
make
the
columbine
conspicuous
even
the
sepals
become
red
but
the
flower
is
yellow
within
it
is
thought
to
guide
visitors
to
the
nectaries
the
stamens
protrude
like
a
golden
tassel
after
the
anthers
pass
the
still
immature
stigmas
the
pollen
of
the
outer
row
ripens
ready
for
removal
while
the
inner
row
of
undeveloped
stamens
still
acts
as
a
sheath
for
the
stigmas
owing
to
the
pendent
position
of
the
flower
no
pollen
could
fall
on
the
latter
in
any
case
the
columbine
is
too
highly
organized
to
tolerate
when
all
the
stamens
have
discharged
their
pollen
the
styles
then
elongate
and
the
feathery
stigmas
opening
and
curving
sidewise
bring
themselves
at
the
entrance
of
each
of
the
five
cornucopias
just
the
position
the
anthers
previously
occupied
probably
even
the
small
bees
collecting
pollen
only
help
carry
some
from
flower
to

but
perhaps
the

bumblebees
and
certainly
the

be
regarded

of

so
completing

indeed
the

royle

prove
that
it

the
shrub
that
was
referred
to
finally
found
that
it

now
there
are
two

the

of

the

of

the

from

one
is
a
purely
arbitrary
line
marked
by

and
often
impossible
to
define
the
animalcule
and
the
insectivorous
plant
know
no
boundaries
between
the

and
who
shall
say
that
the

it
is
well
worth
a
journey
to
some
spongy
sphagnum
bog
to
gather
clumps
of
which
will
furnish
an
interesting
study
to
an
entire
household

they
pursue
their
nefarious
business
in
a

a

a

usually
the
pitchers
are
half
filled
with
water
and
tiny
drowned
victims
when
we
gather
them
some
of
this
fluid
must
be
rain
but
the
open
pitcher
secretes
much
juice
too
certain
relatives
whose

have
hooded
lids
that
keep
out

are
nevertheless
filled
with

on
the

the

so
large

to

small

note
in
passing
that
these
otherwise
dark
prisons
have
translucent

at
the

our

lighted
through
its

a
sweet
secretion
within
the
pitcher
rim
which
some
say
is
intoxicating
others
that
it
is
an
anesthetic

insects
to
a
fatal
feast
it
is
a
simple
enough
matter
for
them
to
walk
into
the
pitcher
over
the
band
of
stiff
hairs
pointing
downward
like
the
withes
of
a
lobster
pot
that
form
an
inner

they
attempt
crawling
over
its

once
their

additionally
hopeless

of
the

that
guard
the

of

and
so
after
vain
attempts
to
fly

out

they
usually
sink
exhausted

to
look
for

nothing
could
be
more
innocent
looking
than
the
tiny
plant
its
nodding
raceme
of
buds
usually
with
only
a
solitary
little
blossom
that
opens
only
in
the
sunshine
at
the
top
of
the
curve
its
leaves
glistening
with
what
looks
like
dew
though
the
midsummer
sun
may
be
high
in
the
heavens
a
little
fly
or
gnat
attracted
by
the
bright
jewels
alights
on
a

only
to
find
that
the
clear
drops
more
sticky
than
honey
instantly
glue
his
feet
that
the
pretty
reddish
hairs
about
him
act
like
tentacles
reaching
inward
to
imprison
him
within
their
slowly
closing
embrace
here
is
one
of
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
operating
in
this
land
of
liberty
before
our
very
eyes
excited
by
the
struggles
of
the
victim
the
sensitive
hairs
close
only
the
faster
working
on
the
same
principle
that
a
vine
tendrils
do
when
they
come
in

with
a

more
of
the
sticky
fluid
pours
upon
the
hapless

plastering
over
his
legs

wings
and
the
pores
on
his
body
through
which
he
draws
his
breath

surely
the

rolls
inward

a
temporary
stomach
the
cruel
hairs
bind
the
glue
suffocates
and
holds
him
fast
death
alone
releases
him
and
now
the
leaf
orgy
begins
moistening
the
fly
with
a
fresh
peptic
fluid
which
helps
in
the
assimilation
the
plant
proceeds
to
digest
its
food
curiously
enough
chemical
analysis
proves
that
this
sundew
secrets
a
complex
fluid
corresponding
almost
exactly
to

was

concealed

by

company
present

that
when

went
to

the
experiment
by
fetching
the
gold
himself
he
was
utterly
at
a
loss
where
to

the
man
with
the

assisted
him
and
informed
him
that
it
could

in

they
were
going

quite
the
contrary

they
pursued
the

dug
out

growing

removed
it

he
induce

to
relieve
him

so
little
esteemed
were
blackberries
in

day
however
a
shrewd
lawyer
named
lawton
at

took
hold
of
it
exhibited
the
fruit
advertised
it
cleverly

succeeded
in
pocketing

should
be
happy
in

of

which
doubtless
concern
them
not
at

they
have
never
heard
the
story
of
the
australians
who
imported
quantities
of
clover
for
fodder
and
had
glorious
fields
of
it
that
season
but
not
a
seed
to
plant
next
year
crops
simply
because
the
farmers
had
failed
to
import
the
bumblebee
after
her
immigration
the
clovers
multiplied
prodigiously
no
the
bee
happiness
rests
on
her
knowledge
that
only
the

long

can
honestly
share
with
her
the
brimming

of

in

children
who

appreciate
her
rapture
if
we
examine
a
little
flower
under
the
magnifying
glass
we
shall
see
why
its
structure
places
it
in
the
pea
family
bumblebees
so
depress
the
keel
either
when
they
sip
or
feed
on
pollen
that
their
heads
and
tongues
get
well
dusted
with
the
yellow
powder
which
they
transfer
to
the
stigmas
of
other
flowers
whereas
the
butterflies
are
of
doubtful
value
if
not
injurious
since
their
long
slender
tongues
easily
drain
the
nectar
without
depressing
the
keel
even
if
a
few
grains
of
pollen
should
cling
to
their
tongues
it
would
probably
be
wiped
off
as
they
withdrew
them
through
the
narrow
slit
where
the
petals
nearly
meet
at
the
mouth
of
the
flower

the

other

our

it
is
scarcely
surprising
that
professor
robertson
found

to

in

whereas
muller
caught

the

are
always
seen

the

almost
exclusively
on

to
live
in

from
the

point
of

at

well
mean
a
life
of
luxury
and
affluence
most
peasants
in

will
tell
you
that
a
dream
about
the
flower
foretells
not
only
a
happy
marriage
but
long
life
and
prosperity
for
ages
the
clover
has
been
counted
a
mystic
plant
and
all
sorts
of
good
and
bad
luck
were
said
to
attend
the
finding
of
variations
of
its

which
had
more

these

fold

both
the

in
a

the

of
each

twist
through
an
angle
of
degrees
until
one
edge
of
each

is

the

darwin
found
always
tend
to

the

with
their

one
facing
and
the

while
the

escapes
the
chilling
of
its

through

by
twisting
to
a
vertical
also
but
bending
to
either
east
or
west
until
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
vertical
upper

of
either
of
the

thus
the
upper

of
the

of
at

one
of

is
sure
to
be
well
protected
through

the

of

will
fill

they
will
not
drive

the

run

be

this

sprengel
who
was
the
first
to
exalt
flowers
above
the
level
of
mere
botanical
specimens
had
his
attention
led
to
the
intimate
relationship
existing
between
plants
and
insects
by
studying
out
the
meaning
of
the
hairy
corolla
of
the
common
wild
geranium
of
germany
sylvaticum
being
convinced
as
he
wrote
in
that
the
wise
author
of
nature
has
not
made
even
a
single
hair
without
a
definite
design
a
hundred
years
before
nehemias
grew
had
said
that
it
was
necessary
for
pollen
to
reach
the
stigma
of
a
flower
in
order
that
it
might
set
fertile
seed
and
linnaeus
had
to
come
to
his
aid
with
conclusive
evidence
to
convince
a
doubting
world
that
this
was
true
sprengel
made
the
next
step
forward
but
his
writings
lay
neglected
over
seventy
years
because
he
advanced
the
then
incredible
and
only
partially
true
statement
that
a
flower
is
fertilized
by
insects
which
carry
its
pollen
from
its
anthers
to
its
stigma
in
spite
of
his
discoveries
that
the
hairs
inside
the
geranium
corolla
protect
its
nectar
from
rain
for
the
benefit
just
as
eyebrows
keep
perspiration
from
falling
into
the
eye
that
most
flowers
which
secrete
nectar
have
what
he
termed
honey
guides
spots
of
bright
color
heavy
veining
or
some
such
pathfinder
on
the

in
spite
of
the
most
patient
and
scientific
research
that
shed
great
light
on
natural
selection
a
before
darwin
advanced
the
theory
he
left
it
for
the
author
of
the
origin
of
species
to
show
that
the
transfer
of
pollen
from
one
blossom
to
another
not
from
anthers
to
stigma
of
the
same
flower
is
the
great
end
to
which
so
much
marvellous
mechanism
is
chiefly
adapted

defeat
flowers
in
the
struggle
for
existence
no
wonder
sprengel
theory
was
disproved
by
his
scornful
contemporaries
in
the
very
case
of
his
wild
geranium
which
sheds
its
pollen
before
it
has
developed
a
stigma
to
receive
any
therefore
no
insect
that
had
not
brought
pollen
from
an
earlier
bloom
could
possibly
fertilize
this
flower
how
amazing
that
he
did
not
see
this
our
common
wild
which
also
has
lost
the
power
to
fertilize
itself
not
only
ripens
first
the
outer
then
the

row
of
anthers

actually
drops
them
off
after

yale
blue
sprengel
who
made
a
most
elaborate
study
of
the
violet
condensed
the
result
of
his
research
into
the
following
questions
and
answers
which
are
given
here
because
much
that
he
says
applies
to
our
own
native
species
which
have
been
too
little
studied
in
the
modern
scientific
spirit
why
is
the
flower
situated
on
a
long
stalk
which
is
upright
but
curved
downward
at
the
free
end
in
order
that
it
may
hang
down
which
firstly
prevents
rain
from
obtaining
access
to
the
nectar
and
secondly
places
the
stamens
in
such
a
position
that
the
pollen
falls
into
the
open
space
between
the
pistil
and
the
free
ends
of
the
stamens
if
the
flower
were
upright
the
pollen
would
fall
into
the
space
between
the
base
of
the
stamen
and
the
base
of
the
pistil
and
would
not
come
in
contact
with
the
bee
why
does
the
pollen
differ
from
that
of
most
other
flowers
in
most
of
such
flowers
the
insects
themselves
remove
the
pollen
from
the
anthers
and
it
is
therefore
important
that
the
pollen
should
not
easily
be
detached
and
carried
away
by
the
wind
in
the
present
case
on
the
contrary
it
is
desirable
that
it
should
be
looser
and
drier
so
that
it
may
easily
fall
into
the
space
between
the
stamens
and
the
pistil
if
it
remained
attached
to
the
anther
it
would
not
be
touched
by
the
bee
and
the
flower
would
remain
unfertilized
why
is
the
base
of
the
style
so
thin
in
order
that
the
bee
may
be
more
easily
able
to
bend
the
style
why
is
the
base
of
the
style
bent
for
the
same
reason
the
result
of
the
curvature
is
that
the
pistil
is
much
more
easily
bent
than
would
be
the
case
if
the
style
were
straight
finally
why
does
the
membranous
termination
of
the
upper
filament
overlap
the
corresponding
portions
of
the
two
middle
stamens
because
this
enables
the
bee
to
move
the
pistil
and
thereby
to
set
free
the
pollen
more
easily
than
would
be
the
case

the
reverse

peter
kalm
a
swedish
pupil
of
linnaeus
who
travelled
here
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
was
more
impressed
by
its
beauty
than
that
of
any
other
flower
he
introduced
the
plant
to
europe
where
it
is
known
as
kalmia
and
extensively
cultivated
on
fine
estates
that
are
thrown
open
to
the
public
during
the
flowering
season
even
a
flower
is
not
without
honor
save
in
its
own
country
we
have
only
to
prepare
a
border
of
leaf
mould
take
up
the
young
plant
without
injuring
the
roots
or
allowing
them
to
dry
hurry
them
into
the
ground
and
prune
back
the
bush
a
little
to
establish
it
in
our

where
it

bloom
freely
after
the

lime
in
the

and
manure
are
fatal
to
it
as
well
as
to
rhododendrons
and
azaleas
all
they
require
is
a
mulch
of
leaves
kept
on

and
summer
that
their
fine
fibrous
roots
may
never
dry
out
all
the

resort
to
a
most
ingenious
device
for
compelling
insect
visitors
to
carry
their
pollen
from
blossom
to
blossom
a
flower
has
its
stigma
erected
where
the
incoming
bee
must
leave
on
its
sticky
surface
the
four
minute
grains
carried
from
the
anther
of
another
flower
on
the
hairy
underside
of
her
body
now
each
anther
is
tucked
away
in
one
of
the
ten
little
pockets
of
the
blossom
and
the
elastic
filaments
are
strained
upward
like
a
bow
after
hovering
above
the
nectary
the
bee
has
only
to
descend
toward
it
when
her
leg
touching
against
one
of
the
of
the
spring
trap
pop
goes
the
little
discharging
pollen
from
its
bores
as
it
flies
upward
so
delicately
is
the
mechanism
adjusted
the
slightest
jar
or
rough
handling
releases
the
anthers
but
on
the
other
hand
should
insects
be
excluded
by
a
net
stretched
over
the
plant
the
flowers
will
fall
off
and
wither
without
firing
off
their
guns
at
least
this
is
true
in
the
great
majority
of
tests
as
in
the
case
of

flowers
no
fertile
seed
is
set
when

keep

only

delicate

however
much
we
may
be
cautioned

the

themselves
upon

near

the

were

not
a

very
many
were
greatly
weakened

several
days
tournefort
endeavored
to
ascertain
whether
this
account
was
corroborated
by
anything
ascertainable
in
the
locality
and
had
good
reason
to
be
satisfied
respecting
it
he
concluded
that
the
honey
had
been
gathered
from
a
shrub
growing
in
the
neighborhood
of
trebizonde
which
is
well
known
there
as
producing
the
effects
it
is
now
agreed
that
the
plants
were
species
of
rhododendron
and

lamberti
confirms

account
by
stating
that
similar
effects
are
produced
by
honey
of
colchis
where
the
same
shrubs
are
common
in
even
fatal
cases
occurred
in
america
in

of
eating

was
traced

may
admire

that
we
find
in

of

will
agree
with

claimed

it

the

take

so
that
it
may

of

no

it

it
may
be
led
to
catch
its
claws
in
the

of

now
pull
it
gently
away
and
you
will
find
a

of
slung
over
his

by
a
slender

stalk
if
you
are

skilful
you
may
induce
your

to
withdraw

many
of
his

and
they
are
not
to
be

let
the

as
hard
as

you
may
now
invite
the

to
take
a
walk
on
another
flower
in
which
he
will
probably
leave
one
or
more
pollinia
in
its
stigmatic
cavities
doctor
kerner
thought
the
milky
juice
in
milkweed
plants
especially
abundant
in
the
uppermost
leaves
and
stems
serves
to
protect
the
flowers
from
useless
crawling
pilferers
he
once
started
a
number
of
ants
to
climb
up
a
milky
stalk
when
they
neared
the
summit
he
noticed
that
at
each
movement
the
terminal
hooks
of
their
feet
cut
through
the
tender
epiderm
and
from
the
little
clefts
the
milky
juice
began
to
flow
bedraggling
their
feet
and
the
hind
part
of
the
ants
were
much
impeded
in
their
movements
he
writes
and
in
order
to
rid
themselves
of
the
annoyance
drew
their
feet
through
their
mouths
their
movements
however
which
accompanied
these
efforts
simply
resulted
in
making
fresh
fissures
and
fresh
discharges
of
milky
juice
so
that
the
position
of
the
ants
became
each
moment
worse
and
worse
many
escaped
by
getting
to
the
edge
of
a
leaf
and
dropping
to
the
ground
others
tried
this
method
of
escape
too
late
for
the
air
soon
hardened
the
milky
juice
into
a
tough
brown
substance
and
after
this
all
the
strugglings
of
the
ants
to
free
themselves
from
the
viscid
matter
were
in
vain
nature
methods
of
preserving
a
flower
nectar
for
the
insects
that
are
especially
adapted
to
fertilize
it
and
of
punishing
all
useless
intruders
often
shock
us
yet
justice
is
ever
stern
ever
kind
in
the
largest
sense
if
the
asclepias
really
do
kill
some
insects
with
their
juice
others
doubtless
owe
their
lives
to
it
among
the
protected
insects
are
the
milkweed
butterflies
and
their
caterpillars
which
are
provided
with
secretions
that
are
distasteful
to
birds
and
predaceous
insects
these
acrid
secretions
are
probably
due
to
the
character
of
the
plants
upon
which
the
caterpillars
feed

the
of

as

shiraz
it
was
in
the
golden
morning
of
the
early
world
when
an
angel
sat
weeping
outside
the
closed
gates
of
paradise
he
had
fallen
from
his
high
estate
through
loving
a
daughter
of
earth
nor
was
he
permitted
to
enter
again
until
she
whom
he
loved
had
planted
the
flowers
of
the
in
every
corner
of
the
world
he
returned
to
earth
and
assisted
her
and
together
they
went
hand
in
hand
when
their
task
was
ended
they
entered
paradise
together
for
the
fair
woman
without
tasting
the
bitterness
of
death
became
immortal
like
the
angel
whose
love
her
beauty
had
won
when
she
sat
by
the
river
twining
in
her
hair
it
was
the
golden
ring
around
the
centre
that
first
led
sprengel
to
believe
the
conspicuous
markings
at
the
entrance
of
many
flowers
served
as
pathfinders
to
insects
this
golden
circle
also
shelters
the
nectar
from

indicates
to
the
fly

bee
just
where
it
must
probe
between
stigma

anthers
to
touch
them
with
opposite
sides
of
its
tongue
since
it
may
probe
from
any
point
of
the
circle
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
side
of
the

that
touched

in

will
touch

also
appropriated

centred
about
that

which
or
simplers
truly
delighted
to
see

none
was
once
more
salable
ages
before
christians
ascribed
healing
virtues
to
the
vervain
found
growing
on

calvary
and
therefore
possessing
every
sort
of
miraculous
power
according
to
the
logic
of
simple
peasant
folk
the
druids
had
counted
it
among

sacred

customs
recorded

both
two
of
the
most
frequently
used
ingredients
in

cauldrons
were
the
vervain
and
the

the
former
probably
derived
its
notoriety
from
the
fact
of
its
being
sacred
to
thor
an
honor
which
marked
it
out
like
other
lightning
plants
as
peculiarly
adapted
for
occult
uses
says
thiselton
dyer
in
his
of
plants
although
vervain
therefore
as
the
plant
was
gathered
by
witches
to
do
mischief
in
their
incantations
yet
as
aubrey
says
it
witches
from
their
will
a
circumstance
to
which
drayton
further
refers
when
he
speaks
of
the
vervain
as
gainst
witchcraft
much
avayling
now
we
understand
why
the

of

dill
with

says

in

even
in

it
grows
wild
and
much
more
abundantly
in

europe

its

is
said
to
have
been
given

because
it
was
so
common
in

whether
the

of

mentioned

and

is
not
certain
strange
that

should
labor
under
the
erroneous
impression
that

is
native

it

an
immigrant

forty
or
more
have

to

in

its

curative
powers
its
use
for

funeral
torches
in
the
middle

the
generic
title
first
used
by
pliny
is
thought
to
be
a
corruption
of
with

in
allusion
to
the
hairy
filaments
or
as
some
think
to
the

of
what
use
is
this
covering
to
the

the
importance
of
protecting
the
delicate
sensitive
active
cells
from

draught
or

have
led
various
plants
to
various
practices
none
more
common
however
than
to
develop
hairs
on
the
epidermis
of
their
leaves
sometimes
only
enough
to
give
it
a
downy
appearance
sometimes
to
coat
it
with
felt
as
in
this
case
where
the
hairs
branch
and
interlace
fierce
sunlight
in
the
exposed
dry
situations
where
the
mullein
grows
prolonged
drought
which
often
occurs
at
flowering
season
when
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
is
at
stake
and
the
intense
cold
which
the
exquisite
rosettes
formed
by
plants
must
endure
through
a
winter
before
they
can
send
up
a
the

these

the

he
passed

of
a

maiden

when

on

ran
after
him

wipe

declared
ever
after

the
impress

features

likeness
when
the
church
wished
to
canonize
the
pitying
maiden
an
abbreviated
form
of
the
latin
words
was
given

veronica
and
her
kerchief
became
one
of

most
precious

is

to

medieval

lovers
whose
piety

have

imaginations
named

from
a
fancied
resemblance

the
relic
of

special
healing
virtue
was
attributed
to
the
square
of
pictured
linen
and
since
all
could
not
go
to
rome
to
be
cured
by
it
naturally
the
next
step
was
to
employ
the
common
wayside
plant
that
bore
the
saint
name
mental
healers
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
because
of
the
strong
popular
belief
in
its
efficacy
to
cure
all
fleshly
ills
it
actually
seemed
to
possess
miraculous
powers
for

it
was
said
to
be
the
infallible
remedy

by

and
wondering
at
the
enormous

of

of

of

we
can
not
but
inquire
into
the
cause
of
such
triumphal
conquest
of
a
continent
by
a
single
genus
much
is
explained
simply
in
the
statement
that
belong
to
the
vast
order
of
flowers
in
reality
made
up
sometimes
of
hundreds
of
minute
florets
united
into
a
socialistic
community
having
for
its
motto
in
union
there
is
strength
in
the
first
place
such
an
association
of
florets
makes
a
far
more
conspicuous
advertisement
than
a
single
flower
one
that
can
be
seen
by
insects
at
a
great
distance
for
most
of
the
composite
plants
live
in
large
colonies
each
plant
as
well
as
each
floret
helping
the
others
in
attracting
their
benefactors
attention
the
facility
with
which
insects
are
enabled
to
collect
both
pollen
and
nectar
makes
the
exceedingly
popular
restaurants
finally
the
visits
of
insects
are
more
likely
to
prove
effectual
because
any
one
that
alights
must
touch
several
or
many
florets
and
them
simply
by
crawling
over
a
head
the
disk
florets
mostly
contain
both
stamens
and
pistil
while
the
ray
florets
in
one
series
are
all
male
immense
numbers
of
wasps
hornets
bees
flies
beetles
and
bugs
feast
without
effort
here
indeed
the
budding
entomologist
might
form
a
large
collection
of
diptera
and
from
among
the
visitors
to
a
single
field
of
alone
usually
to
be
discovered
among
the
throng
are
the
velvety
black
or
that
impostor
the
black
and
yellow
borer
and
the
painted
banded
with
yellow
and
sable
squeaking
contentedly
as
he
gnaws
the
florets
that
feed
him
where
the
slender
brown
wands
etch
their
charming
outline
above
the
fields
how
the

finches
buntings
and

love
to
congregate
of
course
helping
to
scatter
the

to
the
wind
while
satisfying
their
hunger
on
the
swaying
stalks
now
that
the
leaves
are
gone
some
of
the

are
seen
to
bulge
as
if
a
tiny
ball
were
concealed
under
the
bark
in

little
winged

a
fly
will
emerge
from
the
gall
that
has
been
his
cradle
all
winter
blue
and
purple
asters
or
starworts
evolution
teaches
us
that
thistles
daisies
sunflowers
asters
and
all
the
triumphant
horde
of
composites
were
once
very
different
flowers
from
what
we
see
through
ages
of
natural
selection
of
the
fittest
among
their
ancestral
types
having
finally
arrived
at
the
most
successful
adaptation
of
their
various
parts
to
their
surroundings
in
the
whole
floral
kingdom
they
are
now
overrunning
the
earth
doubtless
the
aster
remote
ancestors
were
simple
green
leaves
around
the
vital
organs
and
depended
upon
the
wind
as
the
grasses
do
a
most
extravagant
method
to
transfer
their
pollen
then
some
rudimentary
flower
changed
its
outer
row
of
stamens
into
petals
which
gradually
took
on
color
to
attract
insects
and
insure
a
more
economical
method
of
transfer
gardeners
take
advantage
of
a
blossom
natural
tendency
to
change
stamens
into
petals
when
they
wish
to
produce
double
flowers
as
flowers
and
insects
developed
side
by
side
and
there
came
to
be
a
better
and
better
understanding
between
them
of
each
requirements
mutual
adaptation
followed
the
flower
that
offered
the
best
advertisement
as
the
composites
do
by
its
showy
rays
that
secreted
nectar
in
tubular
flowers
where
no
useless
insect
could
pilfer
it
that
fastened
its
stamens
to
the
inside
wall
of
the
tube
where
they
must
dust
with
pollen
the
underside
of
every
insect
unwittingly
the
blossom
as
he
crawled
over
it
that
massed
a
great
number
of
these
tubular
florets
together
where
insects
might
readily
discover
them
and
feast
with
the
least
possible
loss
of
time

flower
became
the
winner
in

small
wonder
that
our

how

no

half
the

most

are

to
make
up

they
increase
a
thousandfold
if
we
look
closely
at
a
daisy
and
a
lens
is
necessary
for
any
but
the
most
superficial
acquaintance
we
shall
see
that
far
from
being
a
single
flower
it
is
literally
a
host
in
itself
each
of
the
white
petals
is
a
female
floret
whose
open
corolla
has
grown
large
white
and
showy
to
aid
its
sisters
in
advertising
for
insect
visitors
a
prominence
gained
only
by
the
loss
of

the

is
composed
of
hundreds
of
minute
tubular
florets
huddled
together
in
a
green
cup
as
closely
as
they
can
be
packed
inside
each
of
these
tiny
yellow
tubes
stand
the
stamens
literally
putting
their
heads
together
as
the
pistil
within
the
ring
of

develops
and
rises
through
their
midst
two
little

brushes
on
its

sweep
the

from
their
anthers
as
a
rounded
brush
would
remove
the

from
a

chimney
now
the
pollen
is
elevated
to
a
point
where
any
insect
crawling
over
the
floret
must
remove
it
the
pollen
gone
the
pistil
now
spreads
its
two
arms
that
were
kept
tightly
closed
together
while
any
danger
of
lasted
their
surfaces
become
sticky
that
pollen
brought
from
another

may
adhere
to
them
notice
that
the
pistils
in
the
white

florets
have
no
hair
brushes
on
their
tips
because
no
stamens
being
there
there
is
no
pollen
to
be
swept
out
because
daisies
are
among
the
most
conspicuous
of
flowers
and
have
facilitated
dining
for
their

the

said
to
be
a
corruption
of
derived
from
two
greek
words
meaning
immortality
when
some
monks
in
reading
lucian
came
across
the
passage
where
jove
speaking
of
ganymede
to
mercury
says
take
him
hence
and
when
he
has
tasted
immortality
let
him
return
to
us
their
literal
minds
inferred
that
this
plant
must
have
been
what
ganymede
tasted
hence
they
named
it
athanasia
so
great
credence
having
been
given
to
its
medicinal
powers
in
europe
it
is
not
strange
the
colonists
felt
they
could
not
live
in
the

tansy

with

common
or
plumed
thistle
is
land
fulfilling
the
primal
curse
because
it
brings
forth
thistles
so
thinks
the
farmer
no
doubt
but
not
the
goldfinches
which
daintily
feed
among
the
fluffy
seeds
nor
the
bees
nor
the
painted
lady
which
may
be
seen
in
all
parts
of
the
world
where
thistles
grow
hovering
about
the
beautiful
flowers
in
the
prickly
cradle
of
leaves
the
caterpillar
of
this
thistle
butterfly
weaves
a
web
around
its
main
food
store
when
the
danes
invaded
scotland
they
stole
a
silent
night
march
upon
the
scottish
camp
by
marching
barefoot
but
a
dane
inadvertently
stepped
on
a
thistle
and
his
sudden
sharp
cry
arousing
the
sleeping
scots
saved
them
and
their
country
hence

mostly
solitary
at
the

of
formidable

up
which
few
crawling

venture

in
the

of
each
floret
there
is
nectar
secreted
for
the
flying
visitor
who
can
properly
transfer
pollen
from

to

such
a
one
suffers
no
inconvenience
from
the
prickles
but
on
the
contrary
finds
a
larger
feast
saved
for
him
because
of
them
dense
matted
hairs
that
cover
the
bristling
stems
of
most
thistles
make
climbing
mighty
unpleasant
for
ants
which
ever
delight
in
pilfering
sweets
perhaps
one
has
the
temerity
to
start
upward
fain
would
i
climb
yet
fear
i
to
fall
if
thy
heart
fail
thee

not
at
all
might
be
the

outburst
to
the

reply
instead
of
a
sir
walter
and

elizabeth
couplet
long
deeply
cleft
sharply
pointed
and
prickly
dark

make
the
ascent
almost
unendurable
nevertheless
the
ant
bravely
mounts
to
where
the
overlapping
scales
of
the
deep
green
cup
hold
the
luscious
flowers
now
his
feet
becoming
entangled
in
the
cottony
fibres
wound
about
the
scaly
armor
and
a
bristling
bodyguard
thrusting
spears
at
him
in
his
struggles
to
escape
death
happily
releases
him
all
this
tragedy
to
insure
the
seed
that
seated
on
the
autumn
winds
shall
be
blown
far
and
wide
in
quest
of
happy
conditions
for
the
offspring
sometimes
the
pasture
or
fragrant
thistle
or
still
further
protects
its
beautiful
odorous
purple
or
whitish
that
often
measures
three
inches
across
with
a
formidable
array
of
prickly
small
leaves
just
below

a

breaks
through
