all

closely

both
subspecies

the
following
characteristics
no

on

anterior
edge
of
the
carapace
no
ridge
projecting
from
the
nasal
septum
and
a
smooth
carapace

males
these
characters
distinguish
these
two
subspecies
from
the
several
subspecies
of
and
except
for
the
smooth
carapace
in
adult
males
from
another
feature
of
and
not
known
to
be
definitive
or
diagnostic
but
noticed
on
occasion
is
the
pale
orange
cast
in
life
of
the
dorsal
surface
of
the
carapace
and
soft
parts
of
the
body
in
young
of

unfortunately
the
distinctive
dorsal
spotting
in
young
becomes
obscure
or
absent
in
some
adults
of
both
sexes
spotting
in

males
is
not
so
as
in
juveniles
it
may
be
absent
tu

indicated

obscure

is
usually

the

obscure
in

length

mm
two
additional
features
are
so
far
as
known
universal
in
these
are
the
absence
of
striping
on
the
dorsal
surface
of
the
snout
and
the
presence
of
thick
black
borders
of
the
postocular
stripe

adult

these
features
have
also
been
observed
in
some
specimens
of
their
presence
in

not
be
properly
evaluated
at
this
time
and
is
seemingly
not
due
to
individual
variation
these
two
characters
however
coupled
with
the
distinctive
juvenile
pattern
of
spots
serve
in
combination
to
distinguish
from
the
two
populations
are
recognized
as
subspecies
because
there
is
close
resemblance
the
diagnostic
characters
pertaining
to
pattern
are
few
and
superficial
and
the
geographic
ranges
are
allopatric
but
juxtaposed
it
is
probable
that
and
would
be
capable
of
interbreeding
if
they
were
not
spatially
isolated
it
should
be
pointed
out
however
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
intergradation
between

in
the
lower
mississippi

as

been
reported
