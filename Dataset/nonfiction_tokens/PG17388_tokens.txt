early
days
at
school
and
college
the
name
of
andrew
marvell
ever
sounds
sweet
and
always
has
to
use
words
of
charles
lamb
a
fine
relish
to
the
ear
as
the
author
of
poetry
of
exquisite
quality
where
for
the
last
time
may
be
heard
the
priceless
note
of
the
elizabethan
lyricist
whilst
at
the
same
moment
utterance
is
being
given
to
thoughts
and
feelings
which
reach
far
forward
to
wordsworth
and
shelley
marvell
can
never
be
forgotten
in
his
native
england
lines
of
marvell
poetry
have
secured
the
final
honours
and
incurred
the
peril
of
becoming
familiar
quotations
ready
for
use
on
a
great
variety
of
occasion
we
may
perhaps
have
been
bidden
once
or
twice
too
often
to
remember
how
the
royal
actor
nothing
common
did
or
mean
upon
that
memorable
scene
or
have
been
assured
to
our
surprise
by
some
worldling
how
he
always
hears
at
his
back
time
wingèd
chariot
hurrying
near
a
true
poet
can
however
never
be
defiled
by
the
rough
usage
of
the
populace
as
a
politician
marvell
lives
in
the
vivacious
which
if
they
die
out
as
they
show
some
signs
of
doing
will
carry
with
them
half
the
historic
sense
of
the
nation
as
the
hero
of
an
anecdote
of
an
unsuccessful
attempt
made
upon
his
political
virtue
by
a
minister
of
the
crown
as
a
rare
type
of
an
inflexible
patriot
and
as
the
last
member
of
the
house
of
commons
who
was
content
to
take
wages
from
instead
of
contributing
to
the
support
of
his
constituents
as
the
intimate
friend
and
colleague
of
milton
marvell
shares
some
of
the
indescribable
majesty
of
that
throne
a
poet
a
scholar
a
traveller
a
diplomat
a
famous
wit
an
active
member
of
parliament
from
the
restoration
to
his
death
in
the
life
of
andrew
marvell
might
be
supposed
to
be
one
easy
to
write
at
all
events
after
the
fashion
in
which
men
lives
get
written
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
as
many
can
testify
a
more
elusive
character
is
hardly
to
be
found
we
know
all
about
him
but
very
little
of
him
his
parentage
his
places
of
education
many
of
his
friends
and
acquaintances
are
all
known
he
wrote
nearly
four
hundred
letters
to
his
hull
constituents
carefully
preserved
by
the
corporation
in
which
he
narrates
with
much
particularity
the
course
of
public
business
at
westminster
notwithstanding
these
materials
the
man
andrew
marvell
remains
undiscovered
he
rarely
comes
to
the
surface
though
both
an
author
and
a
member
of
parliament
not
a
trace
of
personal
vanity
is
noticeable
and
vanity
is
a
quality
of
great
assistance
to
the
biographer
that
marvell
was
a
strong
shrewd
capable
man
of
affairs
with
enormous
powers
of
his
hull
correspondence
clearly
proves
but
what
more
he
was
it
is
hard
to
say
he
rarely
spoke
during
his
eighteen
years
in
the
house
of
commons
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
that
such
a
man
in
such
a
place
was
in
disraeli
phrase
a
personage
yet
when
we
look
for
recognition
of
what
we
feel
sure
was
the
fact
we
fail
to
find
it
bishop
burnet
in
his
delightful
history
supplies
us
with
sketches
of
the
leading
parliamentarians
of
marvell
day
yet
to
marvell
himself
he
refers
but
once
and
then
not
by
name
but
as
the
liveliest
droll
of
the
age
words
which
mean
much
but
tell
little
in
clarendon
another
book
which
lets
the
reader
into
the
very
clash
and
crowd
of
life
there
is
no
mention
of
one
of
the
most
bitter
and
cruel
enemies
with
prince
rupert
marvell
was
credited
by
his
contemporaries
with
a
great
intimacy
he
was
a
friend
of
harrington
it
may
be
he
was
a
member
of
the
once
famous
rota
club
it
is
impossible
to
resist
the
conviction
that
wherever
he
went
he
made
a
great
impression
that
he
was
a
central
figure
in
the
lobbies
of
the
house
of
commons
and
a
man
of
much
account
yet
no
record
survives
either
to
convince
posterity
of
his
social
charm
or
even
to
convey
any
exact
notion
of
his
personal
character
a
somewhat
solitary
man
he
would
appear
to
have
been
though
fond
of
occasional
jollity
he
lived
alone
in
lodgings
and
was
much
immersed
in
business
about
a
good
deal
of
which
we
know
nothing
except
that
it
took
him
abroad
his
death
was
sudden
and
when
three
years
afterwards
the
first
edition
of
his
poems
made
its
appearance
it
was
prefaced
by
a
certificate
signed
mary
marvell
to
the
effect
that
everything
in
the
book
was
printed
according
to
the
copies
of
my
late
dear
husband
until
after
marvell
death
we
never
hear
of
marvell
and
with
this
signed
certificate
she
disappears
in
a
series
of
lives
of
poets
wives
it
would
be
hard
to
make
much
of
andrew
marvell
for
different
but
still
cogent
reasons
it
is
hard
to
write
a
life
of
her
famous
husband
andrew
marvell
was
born
at
winestead
in
holdernesse
on
easter
eve
the
of
march
in
the
rectory
house
the
elder
marvell
also
andrew
being
then
the
parson
of
the
parish
no
fitter
birthplace
for
a
can
be
imagined
roses
still
riot
in
winestead
the
roots
are
as
mossy
as
in
the
seventeenth
century
at
the
right
season
you
may
still
through
the
hazels
thick
espy
the
hatching
throstle
shining
eye
birds
fruits
and
flowers
woods
gardens
meads
and
rivers
still
make
the
poet
birthplace
lovely
loveliness
magic
and
grace
they
are
here
they
are
set
in
the
world
they
abide
and
the
finest
of
souls
has
not
been
thrilled
by
them
all
nor
the
dullest
been
dead
to
them
quite
the
poet
who
sings
them
may
die
but
they
are
immortal
and
live
for
they
are
the
life
of
the
world
holdernesse
was
not
the
original
home
of
the
marvells
who
would
seem
to
have
been
mostly
cambridgeshire
folk
though
the
name
crops
up
in
other
counties
whether
cambridge
men
of
a
studious
turn
still
take
long
walks
i
do
not
know
but
some
vast
amount
of
years
ago
it
was
considered
a
pleasant
excursion
either
on
foot
or
on
a
hired
steed
from
cambridge
to
meldreth
where
the
elizabethan
long
known
as
the
marvells
agreeably
embodied
the
tradition
that
here
it
was
that
the
poet
father
was
born
in
the
church
registers
have
disappeared
proof
is
impossible
that
there
were
marvells
in
the
neighbourhood
is
certain
the
famous
cambridge
antiquary
william
cole
perhaps
the
greatest
of
all
our
collectors
has
included
among
his
copies
of
early
wills
those
of
several
marvells
and
mervells
of
meldreth
and
shepreth
belonging
to
times
as
their
pious
gifts
to
the
high
altar
and
to
our
lady
light
pleasingly
testify
but
our
andrew
was
a
determined
protestant
the
poet
father
is
an
interesting
figure
in
our
church
history
educated
at
emmanuel
college
from
whence
he
proceeded
a
master
of
arts
in
he
took
orders
and
after
serving
as
curate
at
flamborough
was
inducted
to
the
living
of
winestead
in
where
he
remained
till
in
which
year
he
went
to
hull
as
master
of
the
grammar
school
and
lecturer
that
is
preacher
of
trinity
church
the
elder
marvell
belonged
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
useful
and
even
heroic
life
to
the
reformed
church
of
england
or
as
his
son
puts
it
a
conformist
to
the
rites
and
ceremonies
of
the
church
of
england
though
i
confess
none
of
the
most
and
eager
in
them
the
younger
marvell
with
one
boyish
interval
belonged
all
through
his
life
to
the
paternal
school
of
religious
thought
fuller
account
of
the
elder
marvell
is
too
good
to
be
passed
over
he
afterwards
became
minister
at
hull
where
for
his
lifetime
he
was
well
beloved
most
facetious
in
discourse
yet
grave
in
his
carriage
a
most
excellent
preacher
who
like
a
good
husband
never
broached
what
he
had
new
brewed
but
preached
what
he
had
some
competent
time
before
insomuch
that
he
was
wont
to
say
that
he
would
cross
the
common
proverb
which
called
saturday
the
and
monday
the
holyday
of
preachers
it
happened
that
anno
dom
crossing
humber
in
a
barrow
boat
the
same
was
sandwarpt
and
he
was
drowned
therein
with
skinner
daughter
to
sir
edward
coke
a
very
religious
gentlewoman
by
the
carelessness
not
to
say
drunkenness
of
the
boatmen
to
the
great
grief
of
all
good
men
his
excellent
comment
upon
peter
is
daily
desired
and
expected
if
the
envy
and
covetousness
of
private
persons
their
own
deprive
not
the
public
of
the
benefit
thereof
this
good
man
to
whom
perhaps
remembering
the
date
of
his
death
the
words
may
apply

a

comfortable

with

they
were
for

back
to
and
may
boast
of
a
long
career
of
usefulness
never
having
fallen
into
that
condition
of
decay
and
disrepute
from
which
so
many
similar
endowments
have
been
of
late
years
rescued
by
the
beneficent
and
of
course
abused
action
of
the
charity
commissioners
andrew
marvell
the
elder
succeeded
to
and
was
succeeded
by
eminent
headmasters
trinity

the

then
what
it
still
is

restored

scott

of
the
great
churches
in
the
north
of
england
the
rev
andrew
marvell
made
his
mark
upon
hull
grosart
who
lacked
nothing
but
the
curb
upon
a
too
exuberant
vocabulary
a
little
less
enthusiasm
and
a
great
deal
more
discretion
to
be
a
model
editor
tells
us
in
his
invaluable
edition
of
complete
works
in
verse
and
prose
of
andrew
marvell
that
he
had
read
a
number
of
the
elder
marvell
manuscripts
consisting
of
sermons
and
miscellaneous
papers
from
which
grosart
proceeds
i
gather
three
things
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
very
brave
fearlessly
outspoken
character
some
of
his
practical
applications
in
his
sermons
before
the
magistrates
are
daring
in
their
directness
of
reproof
and
melting
in
their
wistfulness
of
entreaty
that
he
was
a
man
his
sermons
are
as
full
of
classical
and
patristic
allusions
and
pat
sayings
from
the
most
occult
literatures
as
even
bishop
andrewes
that
he
was
a
man
of
tireless
activity
besides
the
two
offices
named
he
became
head
of
one
of
the
great
hospitals
of
the
town
charter
house
and
in
an
address
to
the
governors
placed
before
them
a
prescient
and
statesmanlike
plan
for
the
better
management
of
its
revenues
and
for
the
foundation
of
a
free
public
library
to
be
accessible
to
all
when
at
a
later
day
and
in
the
midst
of
a
fierce
controversy
andrew
marvell
wrote
of
the
clergy
as
the
reserve
of
our
christianity
he
doubtless
had
such
men
as
his
father
in
his
mind
and
memory
it
was
at
the
old
grammar
school
of
hull
and
with
his
father
as
his
that
marvell
was
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
latin
grammar
and
was
as
he
tells
us
put
to
his
montibus
inquit
erunt
et
erant
submontibus
illis
risit
atlantiades
et
me
mihi
perfide
prodis
me
mihi
prodis
ait
for
as
i
remember
this
scanning
was
a
liberal
art
that
we
learn
at
grammar
school
and
to
scan
verses
as
he
does
the
author
prose
before
we
did
or
were
obliged
to
understand
them
irrational
methods
have
often
amazingly
good
results
and
the
hull
grammar
school
provided
its
only
son
with
the
rudiments
of
learning
thus
enabling
him
to
become
in
after
years
what
john
milton
himself
the
author
of
that
terrible
on
addressed
to
hartlibb
affirmed
andrew
marvell
to
be
in
a
written
testimonial
a
scholar
and
in
the
latin
and
greek
authors
attached
to
the
grammar
school
there
was
a
great
garden
renowned
for
its
and
flowers
so
by
leaving
winestead
behind
our
that
was
to
be
was
not
deprived
of
inspiration
apart
from
these
meagre
facts
we
know
nothing
of
marvell
boyhood
at
hull
his
clerical
foe
parker
afterwards
bishop
of
oxford
writes
contemptuously
of
an
whelp
of
a
country
vicar
and
in
another
passage
which
undoubtedly
refers
to
marvell
he
speaks
of
an
unhappy
education
among
boatswains
and
whose
unsavoury
phrases
he
goes
on
to
suggest
marvell
picked
up
in
his
childhood
but
truth
need
not
be
looked
for

the
best
argument
for
a
married
clergy
is
to
be
found
for
englishmen
at
all
events
in
the
volumes
of
the

where
are
recorded
the
services
rendered
to
religion
philosophy

the

by

of

a
country
vicar
parsons
wives
may
sometimes
be
trying
and
hard
to
explain
but
an
england
without
the
sons
of
her
clergy
would
be
shorn
of
half
her
glory
marvell
boyhood
seems
to
have
been
surrounded
with
the
things
that
most
make
for
a
child
happiness
a
sensible
affectionate
humorous
religious
father
occupying
a
position
of
authority
and
greatly
respected
a
mother
and
three
elder
sisters
to
make
much
of
his
bright
wit
and
early
adventures
a
comfortable
yet
simple
home
and
an
atmosphere
of
piety
learning
and
good
fellowship
what
more
is
wanted
or
can
be
desired
the
boatswains
and
of
bishop
fancy
were
in
the
neighbourhood
no
doubt
and
as
stray
companions
for
a
must
have
had
their
attractions
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
attribute
andrew
marvell
style
in
controversy
to
his
early
acquaintance
with
a
population
for
he
is
far
more
likely
to
have
picked
it
up
from
his
great
friend
and
colleague
the
author
of
marvell
school
education
over
he
went
up
to
cambridge
not
to
his
father
old
college
but
to
the
more
splendid
foundation
of
trinity
about
the
date
of
his
matriculation
there
is
a
doubt
in
wood
there
is
a
note
to
the
effect
that
marvell
was
admitted
in
matriculam
acad
cant
coll
trin
on
the
of
december
when
the
boy
was
but
twelve
years
old
lort
a
famous
master
of
trinity
in
his
day
writing
in
november
to
captain
edward
thompson
of
whom
more
later
on
told
the
captain
that
until
there
was
no
register
of
admissions
of
ordinary
students
or
pensioners
as
they
are
called
but
only
a
register
of
fellows
and
foundation
scholars
and
in
this
register
marvell
name
appears
as
a
scholar
sworn
and
admitted
on
the
of
april
as
however
marvell
took
his
degree
in
he
must
have
been
in
residence
long
before
april
probably
marvell
went
to
trinity
about
just
before
the
register
of
pensioners
was
begun
as
a
pensioner
becoming
a
scholar
in
and
taking
his
degree
in
cambridge
undergraduates
do
not
usually
keep
diaries
nor
after
they
have
become
masters
of
art
are
they
much
in
the
habit
of
giving
details
as
to
their
academic
career
marvell
is
no
exception
to
this
provoking
rule
he
nowhere
tells
us
what
his
university
taught
him
or
how
the
logic
of
the
schools
he
had
no
choice
but
to
learn
molineus
peter
ramus
seton
keckerman
were
of
reputation
from
one
or
another
of
which
every
cambridge
man
had
to
master
his
his
his
his
and
his
aristotle
physics
ethics
and
politics
were
tutor
books
and
those
young
men
who
loved
to
hear
themselves
talk
were
left
free
to
discuss
much
to
hobbes
disgust
the
freedom
of
the
will
incorporeal
substance
everlasting
nows
ubiquities
hypostases
which
the
people
understand
not
nor
will
ever
care
for
in
the
life
of
matthew
robinson
who
went
up
to
cambridge
a
little
later
than
marvell
june
and
was
probably
a
harder
reader
we
are
told
that
the
strength
of
his
studies
lay
in
the
metaphysics
and
in
those
subtle
authors
for
many
years
which
rendered
him
an
irrefragable
disputant
quolibet
and
whilst
he
was
but
senior
freshman
he
was
found
in
the
bachelor
schools
disputing
ably
with
the
best
of
the
senior
sophisters
robinson
despised
the
ethics
and
physics
but
with
the
new
cartesian
or
experimental
philosophy
he
was
history
particularly
the
roman
was
in
great
favour
at
both
universities
at
this
time
and
young
men
were
taught
so
old
hobbes
again
grumbles
to
despise
monarchy
from
cicero
seneca
cato
and
other
politicians
of
rome
and
aristotle
of
athens
who
seldom
spake
of
kings
but
as
of
wolves
and
other
ravenous
beasts
the
muses
were
never
neglected
at
cambridge
as
the
university
exercises
survive
to
prove
whilst
modern
languages
spanish
and
italian
for
example
were
greedily
acquired
by
such
an
eager
spirit
as
richard
crashaw
the
poet
who
came
into
residence
at
pembroke
in
there
were
problems
to
be
kept
in
the
college
chapel
lectures
to
be
attended
both
public
and
private
declamations
to
be
delivered
and
even
in
the
vacations
the
scholars
were
not
exempt
from
exercises
either
in
hall
or
in
their
rooms
earnest
students
read
their
greek
testaments
and
even
their
hebrew
bibles
and
filled
their
working
more
hours
a
day
than
was
good
for
their
health
whilst
the
idle
ones
wasted
their
time
as
best
they
could
in
an
unhealthy
town
in
an
age
which
knew
nothing
of
boating
billiards
or
cricket
a
there
was
in
marvell
time
for
in
worthington
under
date
of
april
it
stands
recorded
that
on
that
day
and
in
that
place
that
learned
man
received
a
dangerous
blow
on
the
eye
the
only
incident
we
know
of
marvell
undergraduate
days
is
remarkable
enough
for
boy
though
he
was
he
seems
like
the
gibbon
of
a
later
day
to
have
suddenly
become
a
roman
catholic
this
occurrence
may
serve
to
remind
us
how
during
marvell
time
at
trinity
the
university
of
cambridge
ever
the
precursor
in
had
a
catholic
revival
of
her
own
akin
to
that
one
which
two
hundred
years
afterwards
happened
at
oxford
and
has
left
so
much
agreeable
literature
behind
it
fuller
in
his
history
of
the
university
of
cambridge
tells
us
a
little
about
this
highly
interesting
and
important
movement
now
began
the
university
to
be
much
beautified
in
buildings
every
college
either
casting
its
skin
with
the
snake
or
renewing
its
bill
with
the
eagle
having
their
courts
or
at
least
their
fronts
and
gatehouses
repaired
and
adorned
but
the
greatest
alteration
was
in
their
chapels
most
of
them
being
graced
with
the
accession
of
organs
and
seeing
musick
is
one
of
the
liberal
arts
how
could
it
be
quarrelled
at
in
an
university
if
they
sang
with
understanding
both
of
the
matter
and
manner
thereof
yet
some
took
great
distaste
thereat
as
attendancie
to
superstition
the
chapel
at
peterhouse
we
read
elsewhere
which
was
built
in
and
consecrated
by
bishop
white
of
ely
had
a
beautiful
ceiling
and
a
noble
east
window
a
grave
divine
fuller
tells
us
preaching
before
the
university
at
mary
had
this
smart
passage
in
his
sermon
that
as
at
the
olympian
games
he
was
counted
the
conqueror
who
could
drive
his
chariot
wheels
nearest
the
mark
yet
so
as
not
to
hinder
his
running
or
to
stick
thereon
so
he
who
in
his
sermons
could
preach
and
yet
was
your
and
indeed
it
now
began
to
be
the
general
complaint
of
most
moderate
men
that
many
in
the
university
both
in
the
schools
and
pulpits
approached
the
opinions
of
the
church
of
rome
nearer
than
ever
before
archbishop
laud
unlike
the
bishops
of
newman
day
favoured
the
catholic
revival
and
when
bernard
the
lecturer
of
sepulchre
london
preached
a
no
popery
sermon
at
mary
cambridge
he
was
dragged
into
the
high
commission
court
and
as
the
hateful
practice
then
was
a
practice
dear
to
the
soul
of
laud
was
bidden
to
subscribe
a
formal
recantation
this
bernard
refused
to
do
though
professing
his
sincere
sorrow
and
penitence
for
any
oversights
and
hasty
expressions
in
his
sermon
thereupon
he
was
sent
back
to
prison
where
he
died
if
adds
fuller
he
was
miserably
abused
in
prison
by
the
keepers
as
some
have
reported
to
the
shortening
of
his
life
he
that
maketh
inquisition
for
blood
either
hath
or
will
be
a
revenger
thereof
by
the
side
of
this
grim
story
the
incidents
of
the
oxford
movement
seem
trivial
enough
not
a
few
cambridge
scholars
of
this
period
richard
crashaw
among
the
number
found
permanent
refuge
in
rome
the
story
of
marvell
conversion
is
emphatic
but
vague
in
its
details
the
jesuits
who
were
well
represented
in
cambridge
at
the
time
are
said
to
have
persuaded
him
to
leave
cambridge
secretly
and
to
take
refuge
in
one
of
their
houses
in
london
thither
the
elder
marvell
followed
in
pursuit
and
after
search
came
across
his
son
in
a
bookseller
shop
where
he
succeeded
both
in
convincing
the
boy
of
his
errors
and
in
persuading
him
to
return
to
trinity
an
odd
story
and
not
as
it
stands
very
credible
but
grosart
discovered
among
the
marvell
papers
at
hull
a
fragment
of
a
letter
without
signature
address
or
date
which
throws
some
sort
of
light
on
the
incident
this
letter
was
evidently
as
grosart
surmises
sent
to
the
elder
marvell
by
some
similarly
afflicted
parent
in
its
fragmentary
state
the
letter
reads
as
follows
worthy
breerecliffe
being
me
i
related
vnto
him
a
fearfull
passage
lately
at
cambridg
touching
a
sonne
of
mine
bachelor
of
arts
in
katherine
hall
was
this
he
was
lately
inuited
to
a
supper
in
towne
by
a
gentlewoman
where
was
one
nichols
a
felow
of
peterhouse
and
another
or
two
masters
of
arts
i
know
not
directly
whether
felowes
or
not
my
sonne
hauing
noe
but
liuing
meerely
of
my
penny
they
pressed
him
much
to
come
to
liue
at
their
house
and
for
chamber
and
extraordinary
bookes
they
promised
farre
and
then
earnestly
moued
him
to
goe
to
somerset
house
where
they
could
doe
much
for
him
to
some
eminent
place
and
in
conclusion
to
popish
arguments
to
seduce
him
soe
rotten
and
vnsauory
as
being
ouerheard
it
was
brought
in
question
before
the
heads
of
the
uniuersity
being
noe
punishment
is
inioined
him
but
on
next
a
recantation
in
regent
house
of
some
popish
tenets
nicols
let
fall
i
by
breercliffe
some
such
prank
vsed
towards
sonne
i
desire
to
know
what
did
therin
thinking
i
can
not
doe
god
better
seruice
then
bring
it
vppon
the
stage
either
in
parliament
if
it
hold
or
informing
some
lords
of
the
counsail
to
whom
i
stand
much
oblieged
if
a
bill
in
starchamber
be
meete
to
terrify
others
by
making
these
some
publique
spectacle
for
if
such
fearfull
practises
may
goe
vnpunished
i
take
care
whether
i
may
send
a
child
the
lord
the
reference
to
cosens
or
cosin
being
gives
a
clue
to
the
date
for
cosin
was
chosen
on
the
of
november
though
we
can
know
nothing
of
the
elder
marvell
methods
of
they
were
more
successful
than
the
elder
gibbon
who
as
we
know
packed
the
future
historian
off
to
lausanne
and
a
swiss
pastor
house
what
gibbon
became
on
leaving
off
his
romanism
we
can
guess
for
ourselves
whereas
marvell
once
out
of
the
hands
of
these
very
shadowy
jesuits
remained
the
staunchest
of
christian
protestants
to
the
end
of
his
days
this
strange
incident
and
two
college
exercises
or
poems
one
in
greek
the
other
in
latin
both
having
reference
to
an
addition
to
the
royal
family
and
appearing
in
the
for
are
all
the
materials
that
exist
for
weaving
the
story
of
marvell
the
cambridge
undergraduate
the
latin
verses
which
are
horatian
in
style
contain
one
pretty
stanza
composed
apparently
before
the
sex
of
the
infant
was
known
at
cambridge
sive

after
taking
his

in

being
still
a
scholar
of
the
college
must
have
gone
away
for
the

lort
in
his
amiable
letter
of
already
mentioned
points
out
that
this
entry
contains
no
reflection
on
marvell
morals
but
shows
that
he
was
given
notice
to
quit
for
then
much
more
strictly
enjoined
than
it
is
now
the
days
referred
to
in
the
entry
were
so
the
master
obligingly
explains
the
certain
number
allowed
by
statute
to
absentees
whilst
the
acts
mean
the
exercises
also
enjoyned
by
the
statutes
lort
adds
it
does
not
appear
by
any
subsequent
entry
whether
marvell
did
or
did
not
comply
with
this
order
we
may
now
safely
assume
he
did
not
marvell
cambridge
days
were
over
the
vacations
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
year
were
probably
spent
by
marvell
under
his
father
roof
at
hull
where
his
two
elder
sisters
were
married
and
settled
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
andrew
marvell
should
for
so
many
years
have
represented
hull
in
the
house
of
commons
for
both
he
and
his
family
were
well
known
in
the
town
the
elder
marvell
added
to
his
reputation
as
a
teacher
and
preacher
the
character
of
a
devoted
servant
of
his
flock
in
the
hour
of
danger
the
plague
twice
visited
hull
during
the
time
of
the
elder
marvell
first
in
and
again
in
in
those
days
men
might
well
pray
to
be
delivered
from
plague
pestilence
and
famine
hull
suffered
terribly
on
both
occasions
we
have
seen
in
comparatively
recent
times
the
effect
of
the
cholera
upon
large
towns
and
the
plague
was
worse
than
the
cholera
many
times
over
the
hull
preacher
despite
the
stigma
of
which
still
clings
to
him
stuck
to
his
post
visiting
the
sick
burying
the
dead
and
even
which
seems
a
little
superfluous
preaching
and
afterwards
printing
by
request
their
funeral
sermons
a
brave
man
indeed
and
one
reserved
for
a
tragic
end
in
april
the
poet
mother
died
in
the
following
november
the
elder
marvell
married
a
widow
lady
but
his
own
end
was
close
upon
him
the
earliest
consecutive
account
of
this
strange
event
is
in
of
this
year
the
rev
andrew
marvell
lecturer
of
hull
sailing
over
the
humber
in
company
with
madame
skinner
of
thornton
college
and
a
young
beautiful
couple
who
were
going
to
be
wedded
a
speedy
fate
prevented
the
designed
happy
union
thro
a
violent
storm
which
overset
the
boat
and
put
a
period
to
all
their
lives
nor
were
there
any
remains
of
them
or
the
vessel
ever
after
found
tho
earnestly
sought
for
on
distant
shores
thus
died
by
drowning
a
brave
man
a
good
christian
and
an
excellent
clergyman
of
the
reformed
church
of
england
the
plain
narrative
just
quoted
has
been
embroidered
by
many
writers
in
the
interests
of
those
who
love
presentiments
and
ghostly
intimations
of
impending
events
and
in
one
of
these
versions
it
is
recorded
that
though
the
morning
was
clear
the
breeze
fair
and
the
company
gay
yet
when
stepping
into
the
boat
the
reverend
man
exclaimed
for
heaven
and
threw
his
staff
ashore
and
left
it
to
providence
to
fulfil
its
awful
warning
so
melancholy
an
occurrence
naturally
excited
great
attention
and
long
lingered
in
local
memories
everybody
in
hull
knew
who
was
their
member
father
there
is
an
obstinate
tradition
quite
unverifiable
that
skinner
the
mother
of
the
beautiful
young
lady
who
was
drowned
with
the
elder
marvell
adopted
the
young
marvell
as
a
son
sending
to
cambridge
for
him
after
his
father
death
and
providing
him
with
the
means
of
travel
and
that
afterwards
she
bequeathed
him
her
estate
whether
there
is
any
truth
in
this
story
can
not
now
be
ascertained
the
skinners
were
a
hull
family
one
of
them
a
brother
of
that
cyriac
skinner
who
was
urged
by
milton
in
immortal
verse
to
enjoy
himself
whilst
the
mood
was
on
him
having
been
mayor
of
hull
the
lady
doubtless
had
money
and
andrew
marvell
was
in
need
of
money
and
appears
to
have
been
supplied
with
it
it
is
quite
possible
the
tradition
is
true

the
happy
the
seventeenth
century
was
the
century
of
travel
for
educated
englishmen
of
long
leisurely
travel
milton
famous
italian
tour
lasted
fifteen
months
john
evelyn
occupied
four
years
andrew
marvell
lived
abroad
in
france
spain
holland
and
italy
from
to
and
we
have
milton
word
for
it
that
when
the
traveller
returned
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
french
dutch
spanish
and
italian
languages
andrew
marvell
was
a
highly
cultivated
man
living
in
a
highly
cultivated
age
in
daily
converse
with
scholars
poets
philosophers
and
men
of
very
considerable
scientific
attainments
in
reading
clarendon
and
burnet
and
whilst
turning
over
delightful
gossip
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
struck
with
the
width
and
variety
of
the
learning
as
well
as
with
the
wit
of
the
period
intellectually
it
was
a
great
age
no
record
remains
of
marvell
travels
during
these
years
up
and
down
his
writings
the
careful
reader
will
come
across
pleasant
references
to
foreign
manners
and
customs
betokening
the
keen
humorous
observer
and
the
possession
of
that
faculty
that
takes
a
pleasure
half
contemplative
half
the
result
of
animal
spirits
in
watching
the
way
of
the
world
wherever
you
may
chance
to
be
of
another
and
an
earlier
traveller
sir
henry
wotton
we
read
in
walton
and
whereas
he
was
noted
in
his
youth
to
have
a
sharp
wit
and
apt
to
jest
by
time
travel
and
conversation
was
so
polished
and
made
useful
that
his
company
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
delights
of
mankind
in
all
marvell
work
as
poet
as
parliamentarian
as
controversialist
we
shall
see
the
travelled
man
certainly
no
one
ever
more
fully
grasped
the
sense
of
the
famous
sentence
given
by
wotton
to
milton
when
the
latter
was
starting
on
his
travels
pensieri
stretti
ed
il
viso
marvell
was
in
rome
about
i
can
give
no
other
date
during
the
whole
four
years
this
our
only
date
rests
upon
an
assumption
in
marvell
earliest
satirical
poem
he
gives
an
account
of
a
visit
he
paid
in
rome
to
the
unlucky
poetaster
flecknoe
who
was
not
in
rome
until
if
therefore
the
poem
records
an
actual
visit
it
follows
that
the
author
of
the
poem
was
in
rome
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
very
near
but
it
is
as
near
as
we
can
get
richard
flecknoe
was
an
irish
priest
of
blameless
life
with
a
passion
for
scribbling
and
for
printing
his
exquisite
reason
for
both
these
superfluous
acts
is
worth
quoting
i
write
chiefly
to
avoid
idleness
and
print
to
avoid
the
imputation
of
idleness
and
as
others
do
it
to
live
after
they
are
dead
i
do
it
only
not
to
be
thought
dead
whilst
i
am
alive
such
frankness
should
have
disarmed
ridicule
but
somehow
or
another
this
amiable
man
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
type
of
a
dull
author
and
his
name
passed
into
a
proverb
for
stupidity
so
much
so
that
when
dryden
in
was
casting
about
how
best
to
give
pain
to
shadwell
he
devised
the
plan
of
his
famous
satire
macflecknoe
where
in
biting
verse
he
describes
flecknoe
who
was
happily
dead
as
an
aged
prince
who
like
augustus
young
was
called
to
empire
and
had
governed
long
in
prose
and
verse
was
owned
without
dispute
through
all
the
realms
of
nonsense
absolute
dryden
goes
on
to
picture
the
aged
flecknoe
pondering
which
of
all
his
sons
was
fit
to
reign
and
wage
immortal
war
with
wit
and
fixing
on
shadwell
shadwell
alone
my
perfect
image
bears
mature
in
dulness
from
his
tender
years
shadwell
alone
of
all
my
sons
is
he
who
stands
confirmed
in
full
stupidity
the
rest
to
some
faint
meaning
make
pretence
but
shadwell
never
deviates
into
sense
thus
has
it
come
about
that
flecknoe
the
irish
priest
whom
marvell
visited
in
his
roman
garret
in
bears
a
name
ever
memorable
in
literature
marvell
own
poem
though
eclipsed
by
the
splendour
of
glorious
resounding
lines
has
an
interest
of
its
own
as
being
in
its
roughly
humorous
way
a
forerunner
of
the
dunciad
and
grub
street
literature
by
which
in
sundry
moods
is
pleasure
to
be
bound
it
describes
seeking
out
the
poetaster
in
his
lodging
three
staircases
high
at
the
sign
of
the
pelican
in
a
room
so
small
that
it
seemed
a
coffin
set
in
the
stair
head
no
sooner
was
the
rhymer
unearthed
than
straightway
he
began
to
recite
his
poetry
in
dismal
tones
much
to
his
visitor
dismay
but
i
who
now
imagin
myself
brought
to
my
last
trial
in
a
serious
thought
calm
the
disorders
of
my
youthful
breast
and
to
my
martyrdom
preparèd
rest
only
this
frail
ambition
did
remain
the
last
distemper
of
the
sober
brain
that
there
had
been
some
present
to
assure
the
future
ages
how
i
did
endure
to
stop
the
cataract
of
hideous
verse
marvell
invited
the
scarecrow
to
dinner
and
waits
while
he
dresses
as
they
turn
to
leave
for
the
room
is
so
small
that
the
man
who
comes
in
last
must
be
the
first
to
go
out
they
meet
a
friend
of
the
poet
on
the
stairs
who
makes
a
third
at
dinner
after
dinner
flecknoe
produces
ten
quires
of
paper
from
which
the
friend
proceeds
to
read
but
so
infamously
as
to
excite
their
author
rage
but
all
his
praises
could
not
now
appease
the
author
whom
it
did
displease
to
hear
his
verses
by
so
just
a
curse
that
were
ill
made
condemned
to
be
read
worse
and
how
impossible
he
made
yet
more
absurdities
in
them
than
were
before
for
his
untun
voice
did
fall
or
raise
as
a
deaf
man
upon
the
viol
plays
making
the
and
the
periods
run
than
the
atoms
in
the
sun
thereat
the
poet
swell
with
anger
full
and
after
violent
exclamations
retires
in
dudgeon
back
to
his
room
the
faithful
friend
is
in
despair
what
is
he
to
do
to
make
peace
who
would
commend
his
mistress
now
marvell
counselled
him
to
go
in
time
ere
the
fierce
poet
anger
turned
to
rhyme
the
advice
was
taken
and
marvell
finding
himself
at
last
free
from
boredom
went
off
to
peter
to
return
thanks
this
poem
is
but
an
unsatisfactory
de
but
it
is
all
there
is
what
marvell
was
doing
during
the
stirring
years
is
not
known
even
in
the
most
troubled
times
men
go
about
their
business
and
our
poet
was
always
a
man
of
affairs
as
for
his
opinions
during
these
years
we
can
only
guess
at
them
from
those
to
which
he
afterwards
gave
expression
marvell
was
neither
a
republican
nor
a
puritan
like
his
father
before
him
he
was
a
protestant
and
a
member
of
the
reformed
church
of
england
he
stood
for
both
king
and
parliament
archbishop
laud
he
distrusted
and
it
may
well
be
detested
but
good
churchmen
have
often
distrusted
and
even
detested
their
archbishops
gladstone
had
no
great
regard
for
archbishop
tait
before
the
act
of
uniformity
and
the
repressive
legislation
that
followed
upon
its
heels
had
driven
english
dissent
into
its
final
moulds
it
was
not
doctrine
but
ceremonies
that
disturbed
men
minds
and
marvell
belonged
to
that
school
of
english
churchmen
by
no
means
the
least
distinguished
school
which
was
not
disposed
to
quarrel
with
their
over
white
surplices
the
ring
in
matrimony
or
the
attitude
during
holy
communion
he
shared
the
belief
of
a
contemporary
that
no
system
is
bad
enough
to
destroy
a
good
man
or
good
enough
to
save
a
bad
one
the
civil
war
was
to
marvell
what
it
was
to
most
wise
men
not
devoured
by
faction
a
deplorable
event
twenty
years
after
he
wrote
in
the
whether
it
be
a
war
of
religion
or
of
liberty
it
is
not
worth
the
labour
to
inquire
whichsoever
was
at
the
top
the
other
was
at
the
bottom
but
upon
considering
all
i
think
the
cause
was
too
good
to
have
been
fought
for
men
ought
to
have
trusted
god
they
ought
to
have
trusted
the
king
with
that
whole
matter
the
arms
of
the
church
are
prayers
and
tears
the
arms
of
the
subject
are
patience
and
petitions
the
king
himself
being
of
so
accurate
and
piercing
a
judgment
would
soon
have
felt
it
where
it
stuck
for
men
may
spare
their
pains
when
nature
is
at
work
and
the
world
will
not
go
the
faster
for
our
driving
even
as
his
present
majesty
happy
restoration
did
itself
so
all
things
else
happen
in
their
best
and
proper
time
without
any
heed
of
our
officiousness
in
the
face
of
this
passage
and
many
another
of
the
like
spirit
it
is
puzzling
to
find
such
a
man
for
example
as
thomas
baker
the
ejected
fellow
and
historian
of
john
college
cambridge
writing
of
marvell
as
that
bitter
republican
and
dryden
who
probably
knew
marvell
comparing
his
controversial
pamphlets
with
those
of
martin
marprelate
or
at
all
events
speaking
of
martin
marprelate
as
the
marvell
of
those
times
a
somewhat
note
runs
through
marvell
writings
but
it
is
a
familiar
enough
note
in
the
works
of
the
english
laity
and
by
no
means
dissevers
its
possessor
from
the
anglican
church
but
there
are
some
heated
expressions
in
the
satires
which
probably
gave
rise
to
the
belief
that
marvell
was
a
republican
during
the
commonwealth
marvell
was
content
to
be
a
civil
servant
he
entertained
for
the
the
same
kind
of
admiration
that
such
a
loyalist
as
chateaubriand
could
not
help
feeling
for
napoleon
even
clarendon
pedantic
soul
occasionally
vibrates
as
he
writes
of
oliver
and
compares
his
reputation
in
foreign
courts
with
that
of
his
own
royal
master
when
the
restoration
came
marvell
rejoiced
two
things
had
been
destroyed
by
cromwell
kings
and
parliaments
and
marvell
was
glad
to
see
them
both
back
again
in
england
some
verses
of
marvell
attributable
to
this
period
show
him
keeping
what
may
be
called
royalist
company
with
a
dozen
other
friends
of
richard
lovelace
the
cavalier
poet
and
the
author
of
two
of
the
most
famous
stanzas
in
english
verse
marvell
contributed
some
commendatory
lines
addressed
to
his
noble
friend
richard
lovelace
upon
his
poems
which
appeared
with
the
poems
themselves
in
that
year
of
fate
after
the
murder
of
the
king
says
anthony
wood
lovelace
was
set
at
liberty
and
having
by
that
time
consumed
all
his
estate
grew
very
melancholy
became
very
poor
in
body
and
purse
was
the
object
of
charity
went
in
ragged
clothes
whereas
when
he
was
in
glory
he
wore
cloth
of
gold
and
silver
and
mostly
lodged
in
obscure
and
dirty
places
more
befitting
the
worst
of
beggars
and
poorest
of
servants
then
it
was
that
made
its
first
appearance
when
the
fortunes
of
the
gallant
poet
were
at
their
lowest
and
never
to
revive
marvell
seizes
the
occasion
to
deplore
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
a
familiar
theme
with
poets
our
civil
wars
have
lost
the
civic
crown
he
highest
builds
who
with
most
art
destroys
and
against
others
fame
his
own
employs
he
then
glances
scornfully
at
the
new
presbyterian
censorship
of
the
press
the
barbèd
censurers
begin
to
look
like
the
grim
consistory
on
thy
book
and
on
each
line
cast
a
reforming
eye
and
suggests
that
is
in
danger
because
in
its
author
had
been
imprisoned
by
order
of
the
house
of
commons
for
presenting
a
petition
from
kent
which
prayed
for
the
restoration
of
the
book
of
common
prayer
this
danger
is
however
overcome
by
the
ladies
who
rise
in
arms
to
defend
their
favourite
poet
but
when
the
beauteous
ladies
came
to
know
that
their
dear
lovelace
was
endangered
so
lovelace
that
thaw
the
most
congealèd
breast
he
who
lov
best
and
them
defended
best
they
all
in
mutiny
though
yet
undrest
sally
one
of
them
challenged
marvell
as
to
whether
he
had
not
been
of
the
poet
traducers
but
he
answered
no
o
no
mistake
not
i
reply
for
i
in
your
defence
or
in
his
cause
would
die
but
he
secure
of
glory
and
of
time
above
their
envy
or
my
aid
doth
climb
him
bravest
men
and
fairest
nymphs
approve
his
book
in
them
finds
judgment
with
you
love
lovelace
did
not
live
to
see
the
restoration
but
died
in
a
mean
lodging
near
shoe
lane
in
april
and
was
buried
in
bridget
church
let
us
indulge
the
hope
that
the
friends
who
occupied
so
many
of
the
introductory
pages
of
lovelace
occasionally
enlivened
the
solitude
and
relieved
the
distress
of
the
poet
whose
praises
they
had
once
sung
with
so
much
vigour
as
marvell
was
undoubtedly
a
friendly
man
and
one
who
loved
to
be
alone
with
his
friends
and
had
never
any
house
of
his
own
to
keep
up
living
for
the
most
part
in
hired
lodgings
it
would
be
unkind
to
doubt
that
he
at
least
did
not
forget
lovelace
in
his
poverty
and
depression
of
spirit
in
poets
combined
to
weep
over
the
early
grave
of
the
lord
henry
hastings
the
eldest
son
of
the
sixth
earl
of
huntingdon
who
died
of
the
smallpox
in
the
twentieth
year
of
his
age
not
even
this
plentiful
discharge
of
poets
tears
should
rob
the
young
nobleman
of
his
claim
to
be
regarded
as
a
fine
example
of
the
great
learning
accomplishments
and
high
spirits
of
the
age
we
can
still
produce
the
poets
but
what
young
nobleman
is
there
who
can
boast
such
erudition
as
had
rewarded
the
scorned
delights
and
the
laborious
days
of
this
lord
hastings
we
have
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
did
such
a
one
exist
he
probably
would
not
die
of
the
smallpox
among
the
poets
who
wept
on
this
occasion
were
herrick
sir
john
denham
andrew
marvell
and
john
dryden
then
a
westminster
schoolboy
whose
description
of
the
smallpox
is
as
bad
as
the
disease
marvell
verses
begin
very
prettily
and
soon
introduce
a
characteristic
touch
go
stand
betwixt
the
morning
and
the
flowers
and
ere
they
fall
arrest
the
early
showers
hastings
is
dead
and
we
disconsolate
with
early
tears
must
mourn
his
early
fate
in
marvell
then
in
his
year
went
to
live
with
lord
fairfax
at
nunappleton
house
in
yorkshire
as
tutor
to
the
only
child
and
daughter
of
the
house
mary
fairfax
aged
twelve
years
born
july
this
proved
to
be
a
great
event
in
marvell
life
as
a
poet
and
it
happened
at
an
epoch
in
the
distinguished
career
of
the
famous
parliamentarian
general
whose
name
in
arms
through
europe
rings
lord
fairfax
though
he
had
countenanced
if
not
approved
the
trial
and
deposition
of
the
king
had
resolutely
held
himself
aloof
from
the
proceedings
which
beginning
on
saturday
the
of
january
terminated
so
dismally
on
tuesday
the
the
strange
part
played
by
lady
fairfax
on
the
first
day
of
the
trial
though
it
was
no
greater
a
travesty
of
justice
than
many
a
real
trial
both
before
and
after
is
one
of
the
stories
in
english
history
there
are
several
versions
of
it
having
provided
herself
with
a
seat
in
a
small
gallery
in
westminster
hall
just
above
the
heads
of
the
judges
when
her
husband
name
was
called
out
as
one
of
the
commissioners
the
intrepid
lady
no
cavalier
dame
be
it
remembered
but
a
true
blue
presbyterian
a
brave
soldier
daughter
cried
out
lord
fairfax
is
not
here
he
will
never
sit
among
you
you
do
wrong
to
name
him
as
a
sitting
commissioner
this
is
rushworth
version
and
he
was
present
clarendon
who
was
not
present
being
abroad
at
the
time
reports
the
words
as
he
has
more
wit
than
to
be
here
later
on
in
the
day
when
the
president
bradshaw
interrupted
the
king
and
peremptorily
bade
him
to
answer
the
charges
exhibited
against
him
in
the
name
of
the
commons
of
england
assembled
and
of
the
people
of
england
lady
fairfax
again
rose
to
her
feet
and
exclaimed
it
a
lie
not
half
the
people
where
are
they
and
their
consents
oliver
cromwell
is
a
traitor
axtell
who
during
the
trial
was
in
command
of
a
regiment
in
westminster
and
charged
by
his
military
superior
lord
fairfax
himself
with
the
duty
of
maintaining
order
hearing
this
disturbance
went
forward
and
told
lady
fairfax
to
hold
her
tongue
sound
advice
which
she
appears
to
have
taken
after
the
restoration
axtell
was
put
to
his
trial
as
a
regicide
his
defence
which
was
that
as
a
soldier
he
obeyed
his
orders
and
was
no
more
guilty
than
his
general
lord
fairfax
was
not
listened
to
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death
a
fate
which
he
met
like
the
brave
man
he
was
although
fairfax
did
not
immediately
resign
his
command
after
the
death
from
that
moment
he
lost
heart
in
the
cause
lady
fairfax
whose
loyalty
to
charles
may
have
been
quickened
by
her
dislike
of
oliver
had
great
influence
with
him
and
it
may
well
be
that
his
conscience
pricked
him
the
rupture
came
in
june
when
charles
son
made
his
appearance
in
scotland
and
his
peace
with
the
presbyterians
subscribing
with
inward
emotions
it
would
be
unkind
to
attempt
to
describe
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
and
attending
services
and
listening
to
sermons
the
length
of
which
at
least
he
never
forgot
war
was
plainly
imminent
between
the
two
countries
the
question
was
who
should
begin
cromwell
who
had
hurried
home
from
ireland
lambert
and
harrison
were
all
keen
to
strike
the
first
blow
fairfax
felt
a
scruple
and
in
those
days
scruples
counted
was
there
he
asked
a
just
cause
for
an
invasion
of
scotland
a
committee
was
appointed
consisting
of
the
three
warriors
with
john
and
whitelock
to
confer
with
the
and
satisfy
him
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
undertaking
the
six
met
and
having
first
prayed
oliver
praying
first
they
proceeded
to
a
discussion
which
may
be
read
at
length
in
whitelock
vol
iii
the
substance
of
their
talk
was
as
follows
scruple
proved
to
be
that
both
they
and
the
scots
had
joined
in
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
and
that
therefore
until
scotland
assumed
the
offensive
there
was
no
cause
for
an
invasion
cromwell
retort
after
a
preliminary
quibble
was
practical
enough
war
is
inevitable
is
it
better
to
have
it
in
the
bowels
of
another
country
or
in
own
in
one
or
other
it
must
be
fairfax
scruple
however
withstood
this
battery
though
it
was
strongly
enforced
by
harrison
who
in
reply
to
the
question
what
was
the
warrant
for
the
assumption
that
scotland
meant
to
fall
upon
england
inquired
if
scotland
did
not
mean
to
invade
england
for
whose
benefit
were
levies
being
made
and
soldiers
enlisted
fairfax
proved
immovable
every
man
said
he
must
stand
or
fall
by
his
own
conscience
and
as
he
offered
to
lay
down
his
command
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
accept
the
resignation
and
appoint
his
successor
this
was
speedily
done
and
on
the
of
june
oliver
cromwell
esquire
was
appointed
and
of
all
the
forces
on
july
cromwell
crossed
the
tweed
and
on
the
of
september
the
lord
delivered
leslie
into
his
hands
at
dunbar
it
was
in
these
circumstances
that
lord
fairfax
and
his
energetic
lady
and
only
child
went
back
to
their
yorkshire
home
in
the
midsummer
of
taking
marvell
with
them
to
instruct
the
lady
mary
in
the
tongues
nunappleton
house
is
in
the
ainstey
of
york
a
pleasant
bit
of
country
bounded
by
the
rivers
ouse
wharfe
and
nidd
the
modern
traveller
as
his
train
rushes
north
whilst
shut
up
in
his
with
his
rug
his
pipe
and
his
novel
passes
at
no
great
distance
from
the
house
on
the
way
between
selby
and
york
the
old
house
as
it
was
in
time
is
thus
described
by
captain
markham
who
had
a
print
to
help
him
in
his
delightful
of
the
great
lord
it
was
a
picturesque
brick
mansion
with
stone
copings
and
a
high
steep
roof
and
consisted
of
a
centre
and
two
wings
at
right
angles
forming
three
sides
of
a
square
facing
to
the
north
the
great
hall
or
gallery
occupied
the
centre
between
the
two
wings
it
was
fifty
yards
long
and
was
adorned
with
thirty
shields
in
wood
painted
with
the
arms
of
the
family
in
the
three
rooms
there
were
of
delicate
marble
of
various
colours
and
many
fine
portraits
on
the
walls
the
central
part
of
the
house
was
surrounded
by
a
cupola
and
clustering
chimneys
rose
in
the
two
wings
a
noble
park
with
splendid
and
containing
head
of
deer
stretched
away
to
the
north
while
on
the
south
side
were
the
ruins
of
the
old
nunnery
the
and
the
low
meadows
called
extending
to
the
banks
of
the
wharfe
in
this
the
general
took
especial
delight
the
flowers
were
planted
in
masses
tulips
pinks
and
roses
each
in
separate
beds
which
were
cut
into
the
shape
of
forts
with
five
bastions
general
lambert
whom
fairfax
had
reared
as
a
soldier
also
loved
his
flowers
and
excelled
both
in
cultivating
them
and
in
painting
them
from
nature
lord
fairfax
only
went
to
denton
the
favourite
seat
of
his
grandfather
when
the
floods
were
out
over
the
at
nunappleton
and
he
also
occasionally
resorted
to
his
house
at
bishop
hill
in
york
in
this
garden
the
muse
of
andrew
marvell
blossomed
like
the
lord
fairfax
though
furious
in
war
and
badly
wounded
in
many
a
fierce
engagement
was
when
otherwise
occupied
a
man
of
quiet
literary
tastes
and
a
good
bit
of
a
collector
and
some
of
the
rare
books
and
manuscripts
he
had
around
him
at
nunappleton
are
now
in
the
bodleian
the
treasures
of
which
he
had
protected
in
troubled
times
he
loved
to
handle
medals
and
coins
and
knew
the
points
of
old
engravings
he
wrote
a
history
of
the
christian
church
down
to
our
own
reformation
and
composed
a
complete
metrical
version
of
the
psalms
of
david
and
of
the
song
of
solomon
these
and
many
other
productions
which
he
characterised
as
the
employment
of
my
solitude
still
remain
in
his
own
handwriting
amongst
them
yorkshire
men
will
hear
with
pleasure
is
a
treatise
on
the
breeding
of
the
horse
of
the
quality
of
his
wife
we
have
already
had
a
touch
she
was
one
of
the
four
daughters
of
lord
vere
of
tilbury
who
came
of
a
fine
fighting
family
and
whose
daughters
had
a
roughish
chiefly
in
the
netherlands
none
of
the
daughters
were
reckoned
beautiful
either
in
face
or
figure
and
it
may
well
be
that
lady
fairfax
had
something
about
her
of
the
old
campaigner
but
of
her
courage
sincerity
and
goodness
there
can
be
no
question
her
loyalty
was
no
sickly
fruit
of
church
principles
for
her
strong
intelligence
rejected
scornfully
the
slavish
doctrines
alien
to
our
political
constitution
of
divine
right
and
passive
obedience
but
a
loyalty
none
the
less
it
was
of
a
very
valuable
kind
she
was
fond
of
argument
and
with
lady
fairfax
at
nunappleton
there
was
never
likely
to
be
any
dearth
of
sensible
talk
and
lively
reminiscence
the
tragedy
of
the
of
january
could
never
be
forgotten
and
it
is
possible
that
marvell
most
famous
verses
so
nobly
descriptive
of
the
demeanour
of
the
king
on
that
memorable
occasion
derived
their
inspiration
from
discourse
at
nunappleton
of
the
lady
mary
aged
twelve
we
have
no
direct
testimony
when
she
grew
up
and
had
her
portrait
painted
she
stands
revealed
as
a
stout
young
woman
with
a
plain
face
the
poor
soul
needed
all
the
heaven
had
bestowed
upon
her
for
she
had
to
bear
the
misery
and
disgrace
which
were
the
inevitable
of
the
woman
whose
it
was
to
become
the
wife
of
george
villiers
second
duke
of
buckingham
somebody
seems
to
have
taught
her
philosophy
for
she
bore
her
misfortunes
as
best
became
a
great
lady
living
as
one
who
had
sorrow
but
no
grievance
the
duke
died
in
she
lived
on
till
she
was
ever
a
good
friend
to
another
solitary
wife
catherine
of
braganza
marvell
had
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
his
pupil
beside
the
actual
inmates
of
the
great
house
the
whole
countryside
swarmed
with
fairfaxes
at
the
rectory
of
bolton
percy
was
the
late
uncle
henry
fairfax
and
his
two
sons
henry
who
succeeded
to
the
title
and
the
brian
the
biographer
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
at
stenton
four
miles
off
lived
the
widow
of
the
gallant
sir
william
fairfax
who
died
covered
with
wounds
in
before
montgomery
castle
there
were
two
sons
and
two
daughters
at
stenton
whilst
charles
fairfax
another
uncle
and
the
lawyer
and
genealogist
of
the
family
lived
at
no
great
distance
with
no
less
than
fourteen
children
there
were
also
sisters
of
lord
fairfax
with
families
of
their
own
all
settled
in
the
same
part
of
the
county
such
were
the
agreeable
surroundings
of
our
poet
for
two
years
i
must
leave
it
to
the
imaginations
of
my
readers
to
fill
up
the
picture
for
excepting
the
poems
which
we
may
safely
assume
were
written
at
nunappleton
house
and
who
can
doubt
it
read
aloud
to
its
inmates
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
before
considering
the
nunappleton
poetry
a
word
must
be
got
in
of
bibliography
college
exercises
and
complimentary
verses
excepted
marvell
printed
none
of
his
verse
under
his
own
name
in
his
lifetime
so
far
as
his
themes
were
political
there
is
no
need
to
wonder
at
this
indeed
the
wonder
is
how
despite
their
anonymity
their
author
kept
his
ears
but
why
the
nunappleton
verse
should
have
remained
in
manuscript
for
more
than
thirty
years
is
hard
to
explain
until
pope
took
his
muse
to
market
poetry
apart
from
the
drama
had
no
direct
commercial
value
or
one
too
small
to
be
ranked
as
a
motive
for
publication
none
the
less
the
age
loved
distinction
and
appreciated
wit
and
to
be
known
as
a
poet
whose
verses
numbered
good
intellects
was
to
gain
the
to
the
society
of
men
both
of
intellect
and
fashion
and
also
not
infrequently
snug
berths
in
the
public
service
and
secretaryships
to
foreign
missions
and
embassies
thus
there
was
always
in
addition
to
natural
vanity
a
strong
motive
for
a
poet
to
publish
his
poems
one
would
hesitate
to
recommend
a
young
man
who
wanted
to
get
on
in
the
world
to
publish
a
volume
of
verse
but
the
age
of
wit
and
parts
is
over
it
was
not
till
three
years
after
marvell
death
that
the
small
folio
appeared
with
a
fine
portrait
still
dear
to
the
collector
which
contains
for
the
first
time
what
may
be
called
the
of
our
author
together
with
some
specimens
of
his
political
and
satirical
versification
marvell
most
famous
poem
ode
upon
cromwell
return
from
is
not
included
in
the
volume
and
remained
in
manuscript
until
as
also
did
the
poem
upon
cromwell
death
the
remainder
of
the
political
poems
which
had
made
their
first
appearance
as
broadsheets
were
reprinted
after
the
revolution
in
the
of
poems
on
affairs
of
these
verses
were
never
owned
by
marvell
and
it
is
probable
that
some
of
them
though
attributed
to
him
are
not
his
at
all
we
have
only
tradition
to
go
by
in
the
case
of
political
satires
squibs
epigrams
rough
popular
occasional
rhymes
flung
off
both
in
haste
and
heat
to
be
sold
with
old
ballads
in
the
we
need
not
seek
for
better
evidence
than
tradition
which
indeed
is
often
the
only
external
evidence
we
have
for
the
authorship
of
much
more
important
things
now
to
return
to
the
nunappleton
poetry
in
a
poem
of
lines
marvell
tells
the
story
and
describes
the
charms
of
the
house
which
lord
fairfax
built
for
himself
during
the
war
and
to
which
as
just
narrated
he
retired
in
the
summer
of
the
story
is
only
too
familiar
a
one
being
writ
large
over
many
a
fine
property
appleton
house
was
church
loot
in
the
time
of
henry
the
majestic
lord
that
burst
the
bonds
of
rome
the
old
house
at
nunappleton
was
a
cistercian
nunnery
a
religious
house
in
the
community
was
suppressed
and
its
property
appropriated
by
the
of
the
one
sir
thomas
fairfax
the
religious
buildings
were
pulled
down
and
a
new
secular
house
rose
in
their
place
in
these
bare
and
sordid
facts
there
is
not
much
room
for
poetry
but
there
is
a
story
thrown
in
shortly
before
a
yorkshire
heiress
bearing
the
unromantic
name
of
isabella
thwaites
was
living
in
the
cistercian
abbey
under
the
guardianship
of
the
abbess
the
lady
anna
langton
property
under
the
care
of
the
church
is
always
supposed
to
be
in
danger
and
the
lady
anna
was
freely
credited
with
the
desire
to
make
a
nun
of
her
ward
and
so
keep
her
broad
acres
in
wharfedale
and
her
messuages
in
york
for
the
use
of
mother
church
none
the
less
the
young
lady
was
allowed
to
go
about
and
visit
her
neighbours
and
whilst
so
doing
she
fell
in
love
with
sir
william
fairfax
or
he
fell
in
love
with
her
or
with
her
estates
thereupon
so
the
story
proceeds
the
abbess
kept
her
ward
a
close
prisoner
within
the
nunnery
walls
legal
proceedings
were
taken
but
in
the
end
the
privacy
of
the
nunnery
was
invaded
and
miss
thwaites
was
abducted
and
married
to
sir
william
fairfax
at
the
church
of
bolton
percy
the
lady
abbess
had
to
submit
to
but
worse
days
were
in
front
of
her
for
she
lived
on
to
see
the
nunnery
itself
despoiled
and
the
fair
domains
she
had
during
a
long
life
preserved
and
maintained
for
religious
uses
handed
over
to
the
son
of
her
former
ward
isabella
thwaites
our
poet
begins
by
referring
to
the
modest
dimensions
of
the
house
and
the
natural
charms
of
its
surroundings
the
house
was
built
upon
the
place
only
as
for
a
mark
of
grace
and
for
an
inn
to
entertain
its
lord
awhile
but
not
remain
him
or
denton
may
or
billborow
better
hold
than
they
but
nature
here
hath
been
so
free
as
if
she
said
this
to
me
art
would
more
neatly
have
what
she
had
laid
so
sweetly
waste
in
fragrant
gardens
shady
woods
deep
meadows
and
transparent
floods
and
then
starts
the
story
while
with
slow
eyes
we
these
survey
and
on
each
pleasant
footstep
stay
we
opportunely
may
relate
the
progress
of
this
house
fate
a
nunnery
first
gave
it
birth
for
virgin
buildings
oft
brought
forth
and
all
that
shows
the
quarries
whence
this
dwelling
rose
near
to
this
gloomy
cloister
gates
there
dwelt
the
blooming
virgin
thwaites
fair
beyond
measure
and
an
heir
which
might
deformity
make
fair
and
oft
she
spent
the
summer
suns
discoursing
with
the
subtle
nuns
whence
in
these
words
one
to
her
weav
as
by
chance
thoughts
long
conceiv
this
holy
leisure
we
live
innocently
as
you
see
these
walls
restrain
the
world
without
but
hedge
our
liberty
about
these
bars
inclose
that
wilder
den
of
those
wild
creatures
callèd
men
the
cloister
outward
shuts
its
gates
and
from
us
locks
on
them
the
grates
here
we
in
shining
armour
white
like
virgin
amazons
do
fight
and
our
chaste
lamps
we
hourly
trim
lest
the
great
bridegroom
find
them
dim
our
orient
breaths
perfumèd
are
with
incense
of
incessant
prayer
and
of
our
tears
most
strangely
our
complexion
clears
not
tears
of
grief
but
such
as
those
with
which
calm
pleasure
overflows
or
pity
when
we
look
on
you
that
live
without
this
happy
vow
how
should
we
grieve
that
must
be
seen
each
one
a
spouse
and
each
a
queen
and
can
in
heaven
hence
behold
our
brighter
robes
and
crowns
of
gold
when
we
have
prayèd
all
our
beads
some
one
the
holy
legend

here
and
that
once

increase
so
fast
till
miracles
it
work
at
last
what
reply
was
given
by
the
heiress
to
these
arguments
and
others
of
a
still
more
seductive
hue
the
poet
does
not
tell
but
turns
to
the
eager
lover
who
asks
what
should
he
do
he
hints
that
a
nunnery
is
no
place
for
a
virtuous
maid
and
that
the
nuns
unlike
himself
i
hope
are
only
thinking
of
her
property
he
complains
that
though
the
court
has
authorised
him
to
use
either
peace
or
force
the
nuns
still
stand
upon
their
guard
women
do
you
know
whom
you
resist
or
what
you
do
using
a
most
remarkable
poetic
licence
the
poet
refers
to
the
fact
that
this
lover
is
to
be
the
progenitor
of
the
great
lord
fairfax
is
not
this
he
whose
offspring
fierce
shall
fight
through
all
the
universe
and
with
successive
valour
try
france
poland
either
germany
till
one
as
long
since
prophesied
his
horse
through
conquered
britain
ride
the
lover
determines
to
take
the
place
by
assault
it
was
not
a
very
heroic
enterprise
as
marvell
describes
it
some
to
the
breach
against
their
foes
their
wooden
saints
in
vain
oppose
another
bolder
stands
at
push
with
their
old
brush
while
the
disjointed
abbess
threads
the
jingling
of
her
beads
but
their
cannon
were
their
lungs
and
sharpest
weapons
were
their
tongues
but
waving
these
aside
like
flies
young
fairfax
through
the
wall
does
rise
then
the
unfrequented
vault
appeared
and
superstition
vainly
feared
the
relicks
false
were
set
to
view
only
the
jewels
there
were
true
and
truly
bright
and
holy
thwaites
that
weeping
at
the
altar
waits
but
the
glad
youth
away
her
bears
and
to
the
nuns
bequeathes
her
tears
who
guiltily
their
prize
bemoan
like
gypsies
who
a
child
have
the
poet
then
goes
on
to
glorify
the
results
of
this
union
and
to
describe
happy
days
spent
at
nunappleton
by
the
descendants
of
isabella
thwaites
at
the
demolishing
this
seat
to
fairfax
fell
as
by
escheat
and
what
both
nuns
and
founders
willed
is
likely
better
thus
fulfilled
for
if
the
virgin
proved
not
theirs
the
cloister
yet
remainèd
hers
though
many
a
nun
there
made
her
vow
was
no
religious
house
till
now
from
that
blest
bed
the
hero
came
whom
france
and
poland
yet
does
fame
who
when
retirèd
here
to
peace
his
warlike
studies
could
not
cease
but
laid
these
gardens
out
in
sport
in
the
just
figure
of
a
fort
and
with
five
bastions
it
did
fence
as
aiming
one
for
every
sense
when
in
the
east
the
morning
ray
hangs
out
the
colours
of
the
day
the
bee
through
these
known
alleys
hums
beating
the
dian
with
its
drums
then
flowers
their
drowsy
eyelids
raise
their
silken
ensigns
each
displays
and
dries
its
pan
yet
dank
with
dew
and
fills
its
flask
with
odours
new
these
as
their
governor
goes
by
in
fragrant
volleys
they
let
fly
and
to
salute
their
governess
again
as
great
a
charge
they
press
none
for
the
virgin
nymph
for
she
seems
with
the
flowers
a
flower
to
be
and
think
so
still
though
not
compare
with
breath
so
sweet
or
cheek
so
fair
well
shot
ye
firemen
oh
how
sweet
and
round
your
equal
fires
do
meet
whose
shrill
report
no
ear
can
tell
but
echoes
to
the
eye
and
smell
see
how
the
flowers
as
at
parade
under
their
colours
stand
displayed
each
regiment
in
order
grows
that
of
the
tulip
pink
and
rose
but
when
the
vigilant
patrol
of
stars
walk
round
about
the
pole
their
leaves
which
to
the
stalks
are
curled
seem
to
their
staves
the
ensigns
furled
then
in
some
flower
belovèd
hut
each
bee
as
sentinel
is
shut
and
sleeps
so
too
but
if
once
stirred
she
runs
you
through
nor
asks
the
word
oh
thou
that
dear
and
happy
isle
the
garden
of
the
world
erewhile
thou
paradise
of
the
four
seas
which
heaven
planted
us
to
please
but
to
exclude

with
watery
if
not
flaming
sword
what
luckless
apple
did
we
taste
to
make
us
mortal
and
thee
waste
unhappy
shall
we
never
more
that
sweet
militia
restore
when
gardens
only
had
their
towers
and
all
the
garrisons
were
flowers
when
roses
only
arms
might
bear
and
men
did
rosy
garlands
wear
tulips
in
several
colours
barred
were
then
the
switzers
of
our
guard
the
gardener
had
the

his

then

to
sing
the

the

within
the
skin
its
shrunken
claws

i
have
for
my
music
found
a
sadder

more
pleasing
sound
the
whose
fair

are
graced
with
nuptial
rings
their
ensigns
chaste
yet
always
for
some
cause
unknown

unto
the
elms

o
why

a

mourn
that

and
winnow
from
the
chaff
my
head
how
safe
methinks
and
strong
behind
these
trees
have
i
encamped
my
mind
where
beauty
aiming
at
the
heart
bends
in
some
tree
its
useless
dart
and
where
the
world
no
certain
shot
can
make

not

i
on
it

play
and
gall

me
about
ye
gadding
vines

oh
so
close
your
circles
lace
that
i
may
never
leave
this
place
but
lest
your
fetters
prove
too
weak
ere
i
your
silken
bondage
break
do
you
o
brambles
chain
me
too
and
courteous
briars
nail
me
through
oh
what
a
pleasure
is
to
hedge
my
temples
here
with
heavy
sedge
abandoning
my
lazy
side
stretched
as
a
bank
unto
the
tide
or
to
suspend
my
sliding
foot
on
the
osier
underminèd
root
and
in
its
branches
tough
to
hang

at
my
lines

in

severe
of

not

this
poem
having
a
biographical
value
i
have
quoted
at
perhaps
too
great
length
other
poems
of
this
of
marvell
life
are
better
known
his
own
english
version
of
his
latin
poem
contains
lovely
stanzas
how
vainly
men
themselves
amaze
to
win
the
palm
the
oak
or
bays
and
their
uncessant
labours
see
crowned
from
some
single
herb
or
tree
whose
short
and
shade
does
prudently
their
toils
upbraid
while
all
the
flowers
and
trees
do
close
to
weave
the
garlands
of
repose
fair
quiet
have
i
found
thee
here
and
innocence
thy
sister
dear
mistaken
long
i
sought
you
then
in
busy
companies
of
men
your
sacred
plants
if
here
below
only
among
the
plants
will
grow
society
is
all
but
rude
to
this
delicious
solitude
no
white
nor
red
was
ever
seen
so
amorous
as
this
lovely
green
what
life
is
this
i
lead
ripe
apples
drop
about
my
head
the
luscious
clusters
of
the
vine
upon
my
mouth
do
crush
their
wine
the
nectarine
and
curious
peach
into
my
hands
themselves
do
reach
stumbling
on
melons
as
i
pass
insnared
with
flowers
i
fall
on
grass
meanwhile
the
mind
from
pleasure
less
withdraws
into
its
happiness
the
mind
that
ocean
where
each
kind
does
straight
its
own
resemblance
find
yet
it
creates
transcending
these
far
other
worlds
and
other
seas
annihilating
all
that
made
to
a
green
thought
in
a
green
shade
well
known
as
are
marvell
lines
to
his
coy
mistress
i
have
not
the
heart
to
omit
them
so
eminently
characteristic
are
they
of
his
style
and
humour
had
we
but
world
enough
and
time
this
coyness
lady
were
no
crime
we
would
sit
down
and
think
which
way
to
walk
and
pass
our
long
love
day
thou
by
the
indian
ganges
side
rubies
find
i
by
the
tide
of
humber
would
complain
i
would
love
you
ten
years
before
the
flood
and
you
should
if
you
please
refuse
till
the
conversion
of
the
jews
my
vegetable
love
should
grow
vaster
than
empires
and
more
slow
an
hundred
years
should
go
to
praise
thine
eyes
and
on
thy
forehead
gaze
two
hundred
to
adore
each
breast
but
thirty
thousand
to
the
rest
an
age
at
least
to
every
part
and
the
last
age
should
show
your
heart
for
lady
you
deserve
this
state
nor
would
i
love
at
lower
rate
but
at
my
back
i
always
hear
time
wingèd
chariot
hurrying
near
and
yonder
all
before
us
lie
deserts
of
vast
eternity
thy
beauty
shall
no
more
be
found
nor
in
thy
marble
vault
shall
sound
my
echoing
song
then
worms
shall
try
that
virginity
and
your
quaint
honour
turn
to
dust
and
into
ashes
all
my
lust
the
grave
a
fine
and
private
place
but
none
i
think
do
there
embrace
now
therefore
while
the
youthful
hue
sits
on
thy
skin
like
morning
dew
and
while
thy
willing
soul
transpires
at
every
pore
with
instant
fires
now
let
us
sport
us
while
we
may
and
now
like
amorous
birds
of
prey
rather
at
once
our
time
devour
than
languish
in
his
power
let
us
roll
all
our
strength
and
all
our
sweetness
up
into
one
ball
and
tear
our
pleasures
with
rough
strife
through
the
iron
gates
of
life

a
civil
servant
in
the
time
of
the
commonwealth
when
andrew
marvell
first
made
john
milton
acquaintance
is
not
known
they
must
both
have
had
common
friends
at
or
belonging
to
cambridge
fairfax
may
have
made
the
two
men
known
to
each
other
although
it
is
just
as
likely
that
milton
introduced
marvell
to
fairfax
all
we
know
is
that
when
the
engagement
at
nunappleton
house
came
to
an
end
marvell
being
then
minded
to
serve
the
state
in
some
civil
capacity
applied
to
the
secretary
for
foreign
tongues
for
what
would
now
be
called
a
testimonial
which
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
the
of
the
council
john
bradshaw
milton
seems
always
to
have
liked
bradshaw
who
was
not
generally
popular
even
on
his
own
side
and
in
the
secunda
pro
populo
extols
his
character
and
attainments
in
sonorous
latinity
bradshaw
had
become
in
february
the
first
president
of
the
new
council
of
state
which
after
the
disappearance
of
the
king
and
the
abolition
of
the
house
of
lords
took
over

milton
letter
to
bradshaw
who
had
made
his
home
at
eton
is
dated
february
and
is
as
follows
my
lord
but
that
it
would
be
an
interruption
to
the
public
wherein
your
studies
are
perpetually
employed
i
should
now
and
then
venture
to
supply
thus
my
enforced
absence
with
a
line
or
two
though
it
were
onely
my
business
and
that
would
be
no
slight
one
to
make
my
due
acknowledgments
of
your
many
favours
which
i
both
do
at
this
time
and
ever
shall
and
have
this
farther
which
i
thought
my
part
to
let
you
know
of
that
there
will
be
with
you
upon
some
occasion
of
business
a
gentleman
whose
name
is
marvile
a
man
whom
both
by
report
and
the
converse
i
have
had
with
him
of
singular
desert
for
the
state
to
make
use
of
who
also
offers
himself
if
there
be
any
employment
for
him
his
father
was
the
minister
of
hull
and
he
hath
spent
four
years
abroad
in
holland
france
italy
and
spain
to
very
good
purpose
as
i
believe
and
the
gaining
of
these
four
languages
besides
he
is
a
scholer
and
in
the
latin
and
greek
authors
and
no
doubt
of
an
approved
conversation
for
he
now
comes
lately
out
of
the
house
of
the
lord
fairfax
who
was
generall
where
he
was
intrusted
to
give
some
instructions
in
the
languages
to
the
lady
his
daughter
if
upon
the
death
of
weckerlyn
the
councell
shall
think
that
i
shall
need
any
assistance
in
the
performance
of
my
place
though
for
my
part
i
find
no
encumbrance
of
that
which
belongs
to
me
except
it
be
in
point
of
attendance
at
conferences
with
ambassadors
which
i
must
confess
in
my
condition
i
am
not
fit
for
it
would
be
hard
for
them
to
find
a
man
so
fit
every
way
for
that
purpose
as
this
gentleman
one
who
i
believe
in
a
short
time
would
be
able
to
do
them
as
much
service
as
ascan
this
my
lord
i
write
sincerely
without
any
other
end
than
to
perform
my
duty
to
the
publick
in
helping
them
to
an
humble
servant
laying
aside
those
jealousies
and
that
emulation
which
mine
own
condition
might
suggest
to
me
by
bringing
in
such
a
coadjutor
and
remain
my
lord
your
most
obliged
and
faithful
servant
john
milton
addressed
for
the
honourable
the
lord
bradshawe
no
handsomer
testimonial
than
this
was
ever
penned
it
was
unsuccessful
when
milton
wrote
to
bradshaw
weckherlin
was
in
fact
dead
and
on
his
retirement
in
the
previous
december
john
thurloe
the
very
handy
secretary
of
the
council
had
for
the
time
assumed
weckherlin
duties
and
obtained
on
that
score
an
addition
to
his
salary
no
actual
vacancy
therefore
occurred
on
weckherlin
death
none
the
less
shortly
afterwards
philip
meadows
also
a
cambridge
man
was
appointed
assistant
and
marvell
had
to
wait
four
years
longer
for
his
place
when
marvell
connection
with
eton
first
began
is
not
to
be
ascertained
his
friend
john
oxenbridge
who
had
been
driven
from
his
tutorship
at
magdalen
hall
oxford
by
laud
in
to
where
the
remote
bermudas
ride
but
had
returned
home
became
in
a
fellow
of
eton
college
oliver
john
who
at
this
time
was
chancellor
of
the
university
of
cambridge
and
had
married
oxenbridge
sister
was
known
to
marvell
and
may
have
introduced
him
to
his
at
all
events
marvell
frequently
visited
eton
where
however
he
had
the
good
sense
to
frequent
not
merely
the
cloisters
but
the
poor
lodgings
where
the
ever
memorable
john
hales
ejected
from
his
fellowship
spent
the
last
years
of
his
life
i
account
it
no
small
honour
to
have
grown
up
into
some
part
of
his
acquaintance
and
conversed
awhile
with
the
living
remains
of
one
of
the
clearest
heads
and
best
prepared
breasts
in
christendom
hales
died
in
and
his
were
first
published
three
years
later
marvell
words
of
panegyric
are
singularly
well
chosen
it
is
a
curious
commentary
upon
the
confused
times
of
the
civil
war
and
restoration
that
perhaps
never
before
and
seldom
if
ever
since
has
england
contained
so
many
clear
heads
and
breasts
as
it
did
then
small
indeed
is
the
influence
of
men
of
thought
upon
their
immediate
surroundings
the
lord
bradshaw
we
know
had
a
home
in
eton
and
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
marvell
evidently
frequent
visits
to
the
oxenbridges
milton
entrusted
him
with
a
letter
to
bradshaw
and
a
presentation
copy
of
the
marvell
delivered
both
letter
and
book
and
seems
at
once
to
have
informed
the
distinguished
author
that
he
had
done
so
but
alas
for
the
vanity
of
the
writing
man
the
sublime
poet
who
in
his
early
manhood
had
composed
and
was
in
his
old
age
to
write
demanded
further
and
better
particulars
as
to
the
precise
manner
in
which
the
chief
of
his
office
received
not
only
the
book
but
the
letter
which
accompanied
it
nobody
is
now
left
to
think
much
of
bradshaw
but
in
he
was
an
excellent
representative
of
the
class
carlyle
was
fond
of
describing
as
the
prompted
by
this
desire
milton
must
have
written
to
marvell
hinting
as
he
well
knew
how
to
do
his
surprise
at
the
curtness
of
his
friend
former
communication
and
marvell
reply
to
this
letter
has
come
down
to
us
it
is
marvell
glory
that
long
before
he
recognised
the
essential
greatness
of
the
blind
secretary
and
his
letter
is
a
fine
example
of
the
mode
of
humouring
a
great
man
be
it
remembered
as
we
read
that
this
letter
was
not
addressed
to
one
of
the
greatest
names
in
literature
but
to
a
petulant
and
often
peevish
scholar
living
of
necessity
in
great
retirement
whose
name
is
never
once
mentioned
by
clarendon
and
about
whom
the
voluminous
thurloe
who
must
have
seen
him
hundreds
of
times
has
nothing
to
say
except
that
he
was
a
blind
man
who
wrote
latin
letters
odder
still
perhaps
richard
baxter
whose
history
of
his
own
life
and
times
is
one
of
the
most
informing
books
in
the
world
never
so
much
as
mentions
the
one
and
only
man
whose
name
can
without
any
violent
sense
of
unfitness
be
given
to
the
age
about
which
baxter
was
writing
so
laboriously
honoured
sir
i
did
not
satisfie
my
self
in
the
account
i
gave
you
of
presentinge
your
book
to
my
lord
although
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
writ
to
you
all
which
the
messenger
speedy
returne
the
same
night
from
eaton
would
permit
me
and
i
perceive
that
by
reason
of
that
hast
i
did
not
give
you
satisfaction
neither
concerninge
the
delivery
of
your
letter
at
the
same
time
be
pleased
therefore
to
pardon
me
and
know
that
i
tendered
them
both
together
but
my
lord
read
not
the
letter
while
i
was
with
him
which
i
attributed
to
our
despatch
and
some
other
businesse
tendinge
thereto
which
i
therefore
wished
ill
to
so
farr
as
it
hindred
an
affaire
much
better
and
of
greater
importance
i
mean
that
of
reading
your
letter
and
to
tell
you
truly
mine
own
imagination
i
thought
that
he
would
not
open
it
while
i
was
there
because
he
might
suspect
that
i
delivering
it
just
upon
my
departure
might
have
brought
in
it
some
second
proposition
like
to
that
which
you
had
before
made
to
him
by
your
letter
to
my
advantage
however
i
assure
myself
that
he
has
since
read
it
and
you
that
he
did
then
witnesse
all
respecte
to
your
person
and
as
much
satisfaction
concerninge
your
work
as
could
be
expected
from
so
cursory
a
review
and
so
sudden
an
account
as
he
could
then
have
of
it
from
me
oxenbridge
at
his
returne
from
london
will
i
know
give
you
thanks
for
his
book
as
i
do
with
all
acknowledgement
and
humility
for
that
you
have
sent
me
i
shall
now
studie
it
even
to
the
getting
of
it
by
heart
esteeming
it
according
to
my
poore
judgment
which
yet
i
wish
it
were
so
right
in
all
things
else
as
the
most
compendious
scale
for
so
much
to
the
height
of
the
roman
eloquence
when
i
consider
how
equally
it
turnes
and
rises
with
so
many
figures
it
seems
to
me
a
trajan
columne
in
whose
winding
ascent
we
see
imboss
the
severall
monuments
of
your
learned
victoryes
and
salmatius
and
morus
make
up
as
great
a
triumph
as
that
of
decebalus
whom
too
for
ought
i
know
you
shall
have
forced
as
trajan
the
other
to
make
themselves
away
out
of
a
just
desperation
i
have
an
affectionate
curiousity
to
know
what
becomes
of
colonell
overton
businesse
and
am
exceeding
glad
that
skynner
is
got
near
you
the
happinesse
which
i
at
the
same
time
congratulate
to
him
and
envie
there
being
none
who
doth
if
i
may
so
say
more
jealously
honour
you
then
honoured
sir
your
most
affectionate
humble
servant
andrew
marvell
eaton
addressed
for
my
most
honoured
friend
john
milton
esquire
secretarye
for
the
forrain
affaires
at
his
house
in
petty
france
westminster
to
conclude
marvell
eton
experiences
in
and
very
shortly
before
his
obtaining
his
appointment
as
milton
assistant
in
the
place
of
philip
meadows
who
was
sent
on
a
mission
to
lisbon
marvell
was
chosen
by
the
to
be
tutor
at
eton
to
cromwell
ward
dutton
and
took
up
his
residence
with
his
pupil
with
the
oxenbridges
the
following
letter
addressed
by
marvell
to
oliver
will
be
read
with
interest
may
it
please
your
excellence
it
might
perhaps
seem
fit
for
me
to
seek
out
words
to
give
your
excellence
thanks
for
myself
but
indeed
the
only
civility
which
it
is
proper
for
me
to
practice
with
so
eminent
a
person
is
to
obey
you
and
to
perform
honestly
the
work
that
you
have
set
me
about
therefore
i
shall
use
the
time
that
your
lordship
is
pleased
to
allow
me
for
writing
onely
for
that
purpose
for
which
you
have
given
me
it
that
is
to
render
you
an
account
of
dutton
i
have
taken
care
to
examine
him
several
times
in
the
presence
of
oxenbridge
as
those
who
weigh
and
tell
over
money
before
some
witnesse
ere
they
take
charge
of
it
for
i
thought
that
there
might
be
possibly
some
lightness
in
the
coyn
or
errour
in
the
telling
which
hereafter
i
should
be
bound
to
make
good
therefore
oxenbridge
is
the
best
to
make
your
excellency
an
impartial
relation
thereof
i
shall
only
say
that
i
shall
strive
according
to
my
best
understanding
that
is
according
to
those
rules
your
lordship
hath
given
me
to
increase
whatsoever
talent
he
may
have
already
truly
he
is
of
gentle
and
waxen
disposition
and
god
be
praised
i
can
not
say
he
hath
brought
with
him
any
evil
impression
and
i
shall
hope
to
set
nothing
into
his
spirit
but
what
may
be
of
a
good
sculpture
he
hath
in
him
two
things
that
make
youth
most
easy
to
be
managed
modesty
which
is
the
bridle
to
vice
and
emulation
which
is
the
spur
to
virtue
and
the
care
which
your
excellence
is
pleased
to
take
of
him
is
no
small
encouragement
and
shall
be
so
represented
to
him
but
above
all
i
shall
labour
to
make
him
sensible
of
his
duty
to
god
for
then
we
begin
to
serve
faithfully
when
we
consider
he
is
our
master
and
in
this
both
he
and
i
owe
infinitely
to
your
lordship
for
having
placed
us
in
so
godly
a
family
as
that
of
oxenbridge
whose
doctrine
and
example
are
like
a
book
and
a
map
not
only
instructing
the
ear
but
demonstrating
to
the
eye
which
way
we
ought
to
travell
and
oxenbridge
has
looked
so
well
to
him
that
he
hath
already
much
mended
his
complexion
and
now
she
is
ordering
his
chamber
that
he
may
delight
to
be
in
it
as
often
as
his
studys
require
for
the
rest
most
of
this
time
hath
been
spent
in
acquainting
ourselves
with
him
and
truly
he
is
chearfull
and
i
hope
thinks
us
to
be
good
company
i
shall
upon
occasion
henceforward
inform
your
excellence
of
any
particularities
in
our
little
affairs
for
so
i
esteem
it
to
be
my
duty
i
have
no
more
at
present
but
to
give
thanks
to
god
for
your
lordship
and
to
beg
grace
of
him
that
i
may
approve
myself
your
excellency
most
humble
and
faithful
servant
andrew
marvell
windsor
dutton
presents
his
most
humble
service
to
your
excellence
something
must
now
be
said
of
marvell
literary
productions
during
this
period
it
was
in
that
he
began
his
stormy
career
as
an
anonymous
political
poet
and
satirist
the
dutch
were
his
first
victims
good
protestants
though
they
were
marvell
never
liked
the
dutch
and
had
he
lived
to
see
the
revolution
must
have
undergone
some
qualms
in
the
commonwealth
was
at
war
with
the
united
provinces
trade
jealousy
made
the
war
what
politicians
call
inevitable
this
jealousy
of
the
dutch
dates
back
to
elizabeth
and
to
the
first
stirring
in
the
womb
of
time
of
the
british
navy
this
may
be
readily
perceived
if
we
read
john
dee
petty
navy
royal
and
a
politic
plat
plan
for
the
honour
of
the
prince
and
somewhat
later
in
date
england
way
to
win
wealth
these
short
tracts
make
two
things
quite
plain
first
the
desire
to
get
our
share
of
the
foreign
fishing
trade
then
wholly
in
the
hands
of
the
dutch
and
second
the
recognition
that
england
was
a
dependent
for
its
existence
upon
a
great
navy
manned
by
the
seafaring
inhabitants
of
our
coasts
the
enormous
fishing
trade
done
in
our
own
waters
by
the
dutch
the
splendid
fleet
of
fishing
craft
with
twenty
thousand
handy
sailors
on
board
ready
by
every
of
june
to
sail
out
of
the
maas
the
texel
and
the
vlie
to
catch
herring
in
the
north
sea
excited
admiration
envy
and
almost
despair
o
slothful
england
and
careless
countrymen
look
but
on
these
fellows
that
we
call
the
plump
hollanders
behold
their
diligence
in
fishing
and
our
most
careless
negligence
six
hundred
of
these
fisherships
and
more
be
great
busses
some
six
score
tons
most
of
them
be
a
hundred
tons
and
the
rest
three
score
tons
and
fifty
tons
the
biggest
of
them
having
four
and
twenty
men
some
twenty
men
and
some
eighteen
or
sixteen
men
apiece
so
there
can
not
be
in
this
fleet
of
people
no
less
than
twenty
thousand
sailors
no
king
upon
the
earth
did
ever
see
such
a
fleet
of
his
own
subjects
at
any
time
and
yet
this
fleet
is
there
and
then
yearly
to
be
seen
a
most
worthy
sight
it
were
if
they
were
my
own
countrymen
yet
have
i
taken
pleasure
in
being
amongst
them
to
behold
the
neatness
of
their
ships
and
fishermen
how
every
man
knoweth
his
own
place
and
all
labouring
merrily
together
now
in
our
sum
of
fishermen
let
us
see
what
vent
have
we
for
our
fish
in
other
countries
and
what
commodities
and
corn
is
brought
into
this
kingdom
and
what
ships
are
set
in
work
by
them
whereby
mariners
are
best
employed
not
one
it
is
pitiful
this
last
year
at
yarmouth
there
were
three
hundred
idle
men
that
could
get
nothing
to
do
living
very
poor
for
lack
of
employment
which
most
gladly
would
have
gone
to
sea
in
pinks
if
there
had
been
any
for
them
to
go
in
and
this
last
year
the
hollanders
did
lade
sail
of
holland
ships
with
red
herrings
at
yarmouth
for
civita
vecchia
leghorn
and
genoa
and
marseilles
and
toulon
most
of
these
being
laden
by
the
english
merchants
so
that
if
this
be
suffered
the
english
owners
of
ships
shall
have
but
small
employment
for
them
nor
was
the
other
aspect
of
the
case
lost
sight
of
how
can
a
great
navy
necessary
for
our
be
manned
otherwise
than
by
a
race
of
brave
men
accustomed
from
their
infancy
to
handle
boats
fourthly
how
many
thousands
of
soldiers
of
all
degrees
would
be
by
these
means
not
only
hardened
well
to
brook
all
rage
and
disturbance
of
sea
but
also
would
be
well
practised
and
trained
to
great
perfection
of
understanding
all
manner
of
fight
and
service
of
sea
so
that
in
time
of
great
need
that
expert
and
hardy
crew
of
some
thousands
of
would
be
to
this
realm
a
treasure
incomparable
we
see
the
hollanders
being
well
fed
in
fishing
affairs
and
stronger
and
lustier
than
the
sailors
who
use
the
long
southern
voyages
but
these
courageous
young
lusty
younkers
that
shall
be
bred
in
the
busses
when
his
majesty
shall
have
occasion
for
their
service
in
war
against
the
enemy
will
be
fellows
for
the
nonce
and
will
put
more
strength
to
an
iron
crow
at
a
piece
of
great
ordnance
in
training
of
a
cannon
or
culvining
with
the
direction
of
the
experimented
master
gunner
then
two
or
three
of
the
forenamed
surfeited
sailors
and
in
distress
of
sea
and
foul
winter
weather
for
flying
forward
to
their
labour
for
pulling
in
a
or
a
or
shaking
off
a
bonnet
in
a
dark
night
for
wet
or
cold
can
not
make
them
shrink
nor
stain
that
the
north
seas
and
the
busses
and
pinks
have
dyed
in
the
grain
for
such
purposes
the
years
as
they
went
by
only
served
to
increase
english
jealousy
of
the
dutch
who
not
only
fished
our
water
but
did
the
carrying
trade
of
the
world
it
was
no
rare
sight
to
see
yarmouth
full
of
dutch
bottoms
and
dutch
sailors
loading
them
with
english
goods
in
the
early
days
of
the
commonwealth
the
painfulness
of
the
situation
was
accentuated
by
the
fact
that
some
of
our
colonies
or
plantations
as
they
were
then
called
virginia
and
the
barbadoes
for
example
stuck
to
the
king
and
gave
a
commercial
preference
to
the
dutch
shipping
their
produce
to
all
parts
of
the
world
exclusively
in
dutch
bottoms
this
was
found
intolerable
and
in
october
the
long
parliament
nearing
its
violent
end
passed
the
first
navigation
act
of
which
ranke
says
of
all
the
acts
ever
passed
in
parliament
it
is
perhaps
the
one
which
brought
about
the
most
important
results
for
england
and
the
world
the
navigation
act
provided
that
all
goods
from
countries
beyond
europe
should
be
imported
into
england
in
english
ships
only
and
all
european
goods
either
in
english
ships
or
in
ships
belonging
to
the
countries
from
which
these
articles
originally
came
this
was
a
challenge
indeed
another
perpetual
source
of
irritation
was
the
right
of
search
that
is
the
right
of
stopping
neutral
ships
and
searching
their
cargoes
for
contraband
england
asserted
this
right
as
against
the
dutch
who
as
the
world
carriers
were
most
subject
to
the
right
and
not
unnaturally
denied
its
existence
war
was
declared
in
and
made
the
fame
of
two
great
admirals
blake
and
van
tromp
oliver

was
felt
on
the

and
before
many
months
were
over
england
had
captured
more
than
a
thousand
dutch
trading
vessels
and
brought
business
to
a
standstill
in
amsterdam
then
the
great
centre
of
commercial
interests
when
six
short
years
afterwards
the
news
of
cromwell
death
reached
that
city
its
inhabitants
greatly
rejoiced
crowding
the
streets
and
crying
the
devil
is
dead
andrew
marvell
was
impregnated
with
the
new
ideas
about
a
great
reader
and
converser
with
the
best
intellects
of
his
time
and
a
hull
man
he
had
probably
early
grasped
the
significance
of
illuminating
saying
in
the
famous
essay
on
the
greatness
of
kingdoms
and
first
printed
in
that
he
that
commands
the
sea
is
at
great
liberty
and
may
take
as
much
and
as
little
of
the
war
as
he
will
cromwell
though
not
the
creator
of
our
navy
was
its
strongest
inspiration
until
nelson
and
no
feature
of
his
great
administration
so
excited
marvell
patriotic
admiration
as
the
sleepless
energy
in
securing
and
maintaining
the
command
of
the
sea
in
marvell
poem
first
published
as
a
broadsheet
in
entitled
first
anniversary
of
the
government
under
his
highness
the
he
describes
foreign
princes
soundly
rating
their
ambassadors
for
having
misinformed
them
as
to
the
energies
of
the
new
commonwealth
this

first
displayed
in
the
rough
lines

of
published
in
during
the
first

as

the
lines
have
no
great
merit
they
do
not
even
jingle
agreeably
but
they
are
full
of
the
spirit
of
the
time
and
breathe
forth
that
envy
hatred
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
which
are
apt
to
be
such
large
ingredients
in
the
compound
we
call
patriotism
they
begin
thus
holland
that
scarce
deserves
the
name
of

as
but
the
of
the
british
sand
and
so
much
earth
as
was
contributed
by
english
pilots

they

the
this
indigested
vomit

to
the
dutch
by
just
propriety
the
gallant
struggle
to
secure
their
country
from
the
sea
is
made
the
subject
of
curious
banter
how
did
they
rivet
with
gigantic
piles
thorough
the
centre
their
miles
and
to
the
stake
a
struggling
country
bound
where
barking
waves

more

still

laid
and
oft
at

play
at
level
coil
the
fish
ofttimes
the
burgher
dispossessed
and
sat
not
as

but
as
a
guest
this
final
conceit
greatly
tickled
the
fancy
of
charles
lamb
who
was
perhaps
the
first
of
the
moderns
to
rediscover
both
the
rare
merits
and
the
curiosities
of
our
author
hazlitt
thought
poorly
of
the
jest
marvell
proceeds
with
his
ridicule
to
attack
the
magistrates

when

such
humour
as
this
may
well
have
passed

with
the
crowd
the
incident
there
is
always
an
incident
which
served
as
the
actual
excuse
for
hostilities
is
referred
to
as
follows
let
this
one
courtesy
witness
all
the
rest
when
their
whole
navy
they
together
pressed
not
christian
captives
to
redeem
from
bands
or
intercept
the
western
golden
sands
no
but
all
ancient
rights
and
leagues
must
fail
than
to
the
english
strike
their
to
whom
their
province
owes
itself
two
spirited
lines
describe
the
discomfiture
of
van
tromp
and
the
torn
navy
staggered
with
him
home
while
the
sea
laughed
itself
into
a
foam
this
first
dutch
war
came
to
an
end
in
when
holland
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
the
english
flag
in
the
home
waters
and
to
acquiesce
in
the
navigation
act
it
is
a
curious
commentary
upon
the
black
darkness
that
conceals
the
future
that
cromwell
dreading
as
he
did
the
house
of
orange
and
the
youthful
grandson
of
charles
the
first
who
at
the
appointed
hour
was
destined
to
deal
the
house
of
stuart
a
far
deadlier
stroke
than
cromwell
had
been
able
to
do
either
on
the
field
of
battle
or
in
front
of
whitehall
refused
to
ratify
the
treaty
of
peace
with
the
dutch
until
john
de
witt
had
obtained
an
act
excluding
the
prince
of
orange
from
ever
filling
the
office
of
stadtholder
of
the
province
of
holland
the
contrast
between
the
glory
of
oliver
dutch
war
and
the
shame
of
charles
the
second
sank
deep
into
marvell
heart
and
lent
bitterness
to
many
of
his
later
satirical
lines
marvell
famous
ode
upon
cromwell
return
from
in
has
a
curious
bibliographical
interest
so
far
as
we
can
tell
it
was
first
published
in
when
it
was
composed
we
do
not
know
at
nunappleton
house
oliver
was
not
a
in
for
he
had
no
sooner
come
back
from
ireland
than
he
had
stepped
into
the
shoes
of
the
fairfax
and
there
were
those
lady
fairfax
i
doubt
not
among
the
number
who
believed
that
the
new
thought
it
was
high
time
he
should
be
where
fairfax
scruple
at
last
put
him
we
may
be
sure
cromwell
character
was
dissected
even
more
than
it
was
extolled
at
nunappleton
the
famous
ode
is
by
no
means
a
panegyric
and
its
true
hero
is
the
royal
actor
whom
cromwell
so
the
poem
suggests
lured
to
his
doom
it
is
not
likely
that
the
ode
was
composed
after
marvell
had
left
nunappleton
though
it
may
have
been
so
before
he
went
there
there
is
an
old
untraceable
tradition
that
marvell
was
among
the
crowd
that
saw
the
king
die
what
deaths
have
been
witnessed
and
with
what
strange
apparent
apathy
by
the
london
crowd
but
for
this
tradition
one
imagination
would
trace
to
lady
fairfax
the
most
famous
of
the
stanzas
but
to
return
to
the
history
of
the
ode
in
captain
edward
thompson
a
connection
of
the
marvell
family
and
a
versatile
sailor
with
a
passion
for
print
which
had
taken
some
odd
forms
of
expression
produced
by
subscription
in
three
quarto
volumes
the
first
collected
edition
of
andrew
marvell
works
both
verse
and
prose
such
an
edition
had
been
long
premeditated
by
thomas
hollis
one
of
the
best
friends
literature
had
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
hollis
who
gave
to
sidney
sussex
college
the
finest
portrait
in
existence
of
oliver
cromwell
hollis
collected
material
for
an
edition
of
marvell
with
the
aid
of
richard
barron
an
early
editor
of
milton
prose
works
and
of
algernon
sidney
concerning
barron
however
lost
zeal
as
the
task
proceeded
and
complained
justly
enough
of
a
want
of
anecdotes
and
as
the
printer
the
and
accomplished
bowyer
doubted
the
wisdom
of
the
undertaking
it
was
allowed
to
drop
barron
died
in
and
hollis
in
but
the
collections
made
by
the
latter
passed
into
the
hands
of
captain
thompson
who
with
the
assistance
of
robert
nettleton
a
grandson
of
one
of
sisters
at
once
began
to
get
his
edition
ready
on
nettleton
death
his
marvell
papers
came
into
thompson
hands
and
among
them
was
to
quote
the
captain
own
words
a
volume
of
marvell
poems
some
written
with
his
own
hand
and
the
rest
copied
by
his
order
the
was
in
this
volume
and
was
printed
from
it
in
thompson
edition
of
what
has
become
of
this
manuscript
book
it
has
disappeared
destroyed
so
we
are
led
to
believe
in
a
fit
of
temper
by
the
angry
and
uncritical
this
precious
volume
undoubtedly
contained
some
poems
by
marvell
and
as
his
handwriting
was
both
well
known
from
many
examples
and
is
highly
characteristic
we
may
also
be
certain
that
the
captain
was
not
mistaken
in
his
assertion
that
some
of
these
poems
were
in
marvell
own
handwriting
but
as
would
have
it
the
volume
also
contained
poems
written
at
a
later
period
and
in
quite
another
hand
among
these
latter
pieces
were
addison
verses
spacious
firmament
on
and
all
thy
mercies
o
my
watts
paraphrase
israel
freed
from
pharaoh
and
mallet
ballad
and
the
two
addison
pieces
and
the
watts
paraphrase
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
the
nos
and
in
and
ballad
was
first
printed
in
still
there
these
pieces
were
in
manuscript
in
this
volume
and
as
there
were
circumstances
of
mystification
attendant
upon
their
prior
publication
what
does
the
captain
do
but
claim
them
all
of
and
sentimental
ballad
alike
as
marvell
this
of
course
brought
the
critics
ever
anxious
to
air
their
erudition
down
upon
his
head
raised
his
anger
and
occasioned
the
destruction
of
the
book
grosart
says
that
captain
thompson
states
that
the
was
in
marvell
handwriting
i
can
not
discover
where
this
statement
is
made
though
it
is
made
of
other
poems
in
the
volume
also
published
for
the
first
time
by
the
captain
all
therefore
we
know
is
that
the
ode
was
first
published
in
by
an
editor
who
says
he
found
it
copied
in
a
book
subsequently
destroyed
which
contained
among
other
things
some
poems
written
in
handwriting
and
that
this
book
was
given
to
the
editor
by
a
of
the
poet
yet
i
imagine
poor
as
this
evidence
may
seem
to
be
no
student
of
marvell
life
and
character
so
far
as
his
life
reveals
his
character
and
of
his
verse
so
much
of
it
as
is
positively
known
wants
more
evidence
to
satisfy
him
that
the
is
as
surely
as
the
lines
upon
the
his
coy
and
the
great
popularity
of
this
ode
undoubtedly
rests
on
the
three
stanzas
that
thence
the
royal
actor
borne
the
tragic
scaffold
might
adorn
while
round
the
armèd
bands
did
clap
their
bloody
hands
he
nothing
common
did
or
mean
upon
that
memorable
scene
but
with
his
keener
eye
the
axe
edge
did
try
nor
called
the
gods
with
vulgar
spite
to
vindicate
his
helpless
right
but
bowed
his
comely
head
down
as
upon
a
bed
it
is
strange
that
the
death
of
the
king
should
be
so
nobly
sung
in
an
ode
bearing
cromwell
name
and
dedicate
to
his
genius
so
restless
cromwell
could
not
cease
in
the
inglorious
arts
of
peace
but
through
adventurous
war
urgèd
his
active
star
then
burning
through
the
air
he
went
and
palaces
and
temples
rent
and
cæsar
head
at
last
did
through
his
laurels
blast
is
madness
to
resist
or
blame
the
force
of
angry
heaven
flame
and
if
we
would
speak
true
much
to
the
man
is
due
who
from
his
private
gardens
where
he
lived
reservèd
and
austere
as
if
his
highest
plot
to
plant
the
bergamot
could
by
industrious
valour
climb
to
ruin
the
great
work
of
time
and
cast
the
kingdoms
old
into
another
mould
the
last
stanzas
of
all
have
much
pith
and
meaning
in
them
but
thou
the
war
and
fortune
son
march
indefatigably
on
and
for
the
last
effect
still
keep
the
sword
erect
besides
the
force
it
has
to
fright
the
spirits
of
the
shady
night
the
same
arts
that
did
gain
a
power
must
it
maintain
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
ode
was
not
published
in
if
indeed
it
was
the
work
of
that
and
not
of
a
later
year
there
is
nothing
either
of
the
courtier
or
of
the
partisan
about
its
stately
versification
and
sober
solemn
thought
entire
dignity
criticism
of
a
great
man
and
a
strange
career
by
one
well
entitled
to
criticise
are
among
the
chief
characteristics
of
this
noble
poem
it
is
infinitely
refreshing
when
reading
and
thinking
about
cromwell
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
fanatic
scream
and
the
fury
of
the
bigot
whether
of
the
school
of
laud
or
hobbes
andrew
marvell
knew
oliver
cromwell
alive
and
gazed
on
his
features
as
he
lay
dead
he
knew
his
ambition
his
greatness
his
power
and
where
that
power
lay
how
much
might
we
unwittingly
have
lost
if
captain
thompson
had
not
printed
a
poem
which
for
more
than
a
century
of
years
had
remained
unknown
and
exposed
to
all
the
risks
of
a
single
manuscript
copy
when
cromwell
sent
his
picture
to
queen
christina
of
sweden
to
commemorate
the
peace
he
concluded
with
her
in
marvell
though
not
then
attached
to
the
public
service
was
employed
to
write
the
latin
couplet
that
accompanied
the
picture
he
discharged
his
task
as
follows
effigiem
oliveri
hæc
est
quæ
toties
inimicos
umbra
fugavit
at
sub
quâ
cives

lenta
terunt
the
authorship
of
these
lines
is
often
attributed
to
milton
but
there
is
little
doubt
they
are
of
marvell
composition
they
might
easily
have
been
better
marvell
became
milton
assistant
in
september
and
the
friendship
between
the
two
men
was
thus
consolidated
by
the
strong
ties
of
a
common
duty
milton
blindness
making
him
unfit
to
attend
the
reception
of
foreign
embassies
marvell
took
his
place
and
joined
in
respectfully
greeting
the
dutch
ambassadors
after
all
he
was
but
a
junior
clerk
still
he
doubtless
rejoiced
that
his
lines
on
holland
had
been
published
anonymously
literature
was
strongly
represented
in
this
department
of
state
just
then
for
cromwell
chamberlain
sir
gilbert
pickering
who
represented
northamptonshire
in
parliament
had
taken
occasion
to
introduce
his
nephew
john
dryden
to
the
public
service
and
he
was
attached
to
the
same
office
as
andrew
marvell
poets
like
pigeons
have
often
taken
shelter
under
our
public
roofs
but
milton
marvell
and
dryden
all
at
the
same
time
form
a
remarkable
constellation
old
noll
we
may
be
sure
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
marvell
must
have
known
cromwell
personally
but
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
milton
and
cromwell
ever
met
the
popular
engraving
which
represents
a
theatrical
dictating
despatches
to
a
meek
milton
is
highly
ludicrous
cromwell
could
have
as
easily
dictated
a
book
of
on
the
composition
of
which
milton
began
to
be
engaged
during
the
last
year
of

and
despite
the
disinterment
of
their

accepted
the
restoration
gladly
and
lived
to
chuckle
over
the
revolution
the
forgetfulness
no
less
than
the
vindictiveness
of
men
is
often
surprising
marvell
who
played
the
part
of
laureate
during
the
protectorate
produced
two
songs
for
the
conventionally
joyful
occasion
the
second
of
the
two
is
decidedly
pretty

us
with

all
this
merriment
came
to
an
end
on
the
of
september
when
oliver
cromwell
died
on
the
anniversary
of
dunbar
fight
and
of
the
field
of
worcester
and
yet
the
end
though
it
was
to
be
sudden
did
not
at
once
seem
likely
to
be
so
there
was
time
for
the
poets
to
tune
their
lyres
waller
dryden
sprat
and
marvell
had
no
doubt
that
tumbledown
dick
was
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
his
father
and
still
keep
the
sword
erect
and
were
ready
with
their

never
witnessed

that
of
the
late
man
who
made
himself
to

protector
to
quote
words
from
one
of
the
most
impressive
passages
in
english
prose
the
opening
sentences
of
cowley
by
way
of

concerning
the
government
of

of

of

upon

richard
to

the
lines
best
worth
remembering
in
the
poem
are
the
following
i
saw
him
dead
a
leaden
slumber
lies
and
mortal
sleep
over
those
wakeful
eyes
those
gentle
rays
under
the
lids
were
fled
which
through
his
looks
that
piercing
sweetness
shed
that
port
which
so
majestic
was
and
strong
loose
and
deprived
of
vigour
stretched
along
all
withered
all
discoloured
pale
and
wan
how
much
another
thing
no
more
that
man
o
human
glory
vain
o
death
o

o
worthless
world
o
transitory
things
yet
dwelt
that
greatness
in
his
shape
decayed
that
still
though
dead
greater
than
death
he
laid
and
in
his
altered
face
you
something
feign
that
threatens

will
live

cromwell
death
was
an
epoch
in
marvell
history
up
to
that
date
he
had
since
he
left
the
university
led
the
life
of
a
scholar
with
a
turn
for
business
and
was
known
to
many
as
an
agreeable
companion
and
a
lively
wit
he
was
keenly
interested
in
public
affairs
and
personally
acquainted
with
some
men
in
great
place
and
for
a
year
before
cromwell
death
he
had
been
in
a
branch
of
the
civil
service
but
of
the
wear
and
tear
the
strife
and
contention
of
what
are
called
practical
politics
he
knew
nothing
from
personal
experience
within
a
year
of
the
protector
death
all
this
was
changed
and
for
the
rest
of
his
days
with
but
the
shortest
of
occasional
intervals
andrew
marvell
led
the
life
of
an
active
eager
member
of
parliament
knowing
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
chamber
and
hearing
of
everything
that
was
alleged
to
be
going
on
in
the
court
busily
occupied
with
the
affairs
of
his
constituents
in
hull
and
daily
watching
with
an
increasingly
heavy
heart
and
a
bitter
humour
the
corruption
of
the
times
the
declension
of
our
the
growing
shame
of
england
and
what
he
believed
to
be
a
dangerous
conspiracy
afoot
for
the
undoing
of
the
reformation
and
the
destruction
of
the
constitution
in
both
church
and
state
could
not
be
reared
on
such
a
soil
as
this
the
age
of
cromwell
and
blake
was
over
the
remainder
of
marvell
life
save
so
far
as
personal
friendship
sweetened
it
was
spent
in
politics
public
business
in
concocting
roughly
rhymed
and
bitter
satirical
poems
and
in
the
composition
of
prose
pamphlets
through
it
all
marvell
remained
very
much
the
man
of
letters
though
one
with
a
great
natural
aptitude
for
business
his
was
always
the
critical
attitude
he
was
the
friend
of
milton
and
harrington
of
the
political
philosophers
who
invented
paper
constitutions
in
the
rota
club
and
of
the
new
race
of
men
whose
thoughts
turned
to
natural
science
and
who
founded
the
royal
society
office
he
never
thought
of
he
could
have
had
it
had
he
chosen
for
he
was
a
man
of
mark
even
of
distinction
from
the
first
clarendon
has
told
us
how
members
of
the
house
of
commons
got
on
in
the
long
parliament
of
charles
the
second
it
was
full
of
the
king
friends
who
ran
out
of
the
house
to
tell
their
shrewd
master
the
gossip
of
the
lobbies
commended
this
man
and
discommended
another
who
deserved
better
and
would
many
times
when
his
majesty
spoke
well
of
any
man
ask
his
majesty
if
he
would
give
them
leave
to
let
that
person
know
how
gracious
his
majesty
was
to
him
or
bring
him
to
kiss
his
hand
to
which
he
commonly
consenting
every
one
of
his
servants
delivered
some
message
from
him
to
a
parliament
man
and
invited
him
to
court
as
if
the
king
would
be
willing
to
see
him
and
by
this
means
the
rooms
at
court
were
always
full
of
the
members
of
the
house
of
commons
this
man
brought
to
kiss
his
hand
and
the
king
induced
to
confer
with
that
man
and
to
thank
him
for
his
affection
which
could
never
conclude
without
some
general
expression
of
grace
or
promise
which
the
poor
gentleman
always
interpreted
to
his
own
advantage
and
expected
some
fruit
from
it
that
it
could
never
yield
the
suspicious
clarendon
already
shaking
to
his
fall
goes
on
to
add
all
which
being
contrary
to
all
former
order
did
the
king
no
good
and
rendered
those
unable
to
do
him
service
who
were
inclined
to
it
it
is
a
lifelike
picture
clarendon
draws
of
the
crowded
rooms
and
of
the
witty
king
moving
about
fooling
vanity
ambition
and
corruption
to
the
top
of
their
bent
that
the
king
chose
his
own
ministers
is
plain
enough
marvell
was
at
the
beginning
well
disposed
towards
charles
they
had
some
points
in
common
and
among
them
a
quick
sense
of
humour
and
a
turn
for
business
but
the
member
for
hull
must
soon
have
recognised
that
there
was
no
place
for
an
honest
man
in
any
stuart
administration
marvell
and
his
great
chief
remained
in
their
offices
until
the
close
of
the
year
when
the
impending
restoration
enforced
their
retirement
milton
used
his
leisure
to
pour
forth
excited
tracts
to
prove
how
easy
it
would
still
be
to
establish
a
free
commonwealth
once
again
and
for
the
last
time
he
prompted
the
age
to
quit
its
clogs
by
the
known
rules
of
ancient
liberty
these
pamphlets
of
milton
prove
how
little
that
solitary
thinker
ever
knew
of
the
real
mind
and
temper
of
the
english
people
the
lord
richard
cromwell
was
exactly
the
sort
of
eldest
son
a
great
soldier
like
oliver
who
had
put
his
foot
on
fortune
neck
was
likely
to
have
richard
was
not
indeed
born
in
the
purple
but
his
early
manhood
was
nurtured
in
it
religion
as
represented
by
long
sermons
tiresome
treatises
and
prayerful
exercises
bored
him
to
death
of
enthusiasm
he
had
not
a
trace
nor
was
he
bred
to
arms
he
delighted
in
hunting
in
the
open
air
and
the
company
of
sportsmen
whatever
came
his
way
easily
and
as
a
matter
of
right
he
was
well
content
to
take
he
bore
himself
well
on
state
occasions
and
could
make
a
better
speech
than
ever
his
father
was
able
to
do
but
he
was
not
a
restless
cromwell
and
had
no
faith
in
his
destiny
i
do
not
know
whether
he
had
ever
read
in
shelton
translation
a
very
popular
book
of
the
time
probably
not
for
though
chancellor
of
the
university
of
oxford
richard
was
not
a
reading
man
but
if
he
had
he
must
have
sympathised
with
sancho
panza
attitude
of
mind
towards
the
famous
island
if
your
highness
has
no
mind
that
the
government
you
promised
should
be
given
me
god
made
me
of
less
and
perhaps
it
may
be
easier
for
sancho
the
squire
to
get
to
heaven
than
for
sancho
the
governor
the
dark
all
cats
are
the
new
protector
took
up
the
reins
of
power
with
proper
forms
and
ceremonies
and
at
once
proceeded
to
summon
a
parliament
an
imperial
cromwellian
parliament
containing
representatives
both
from
scotland
and
ireland
in
this
parliament
andrew
marvell
sat
for
the
first
time
as
one
of
the
two
members
for
his
election
took
place
on
the
of
january
being
the
first
county
day
after
the
sheriff
had
received
the
writ
five
candidates
were
nominated
thomas

andrew

john
ramsden
henry

and
sir

and
a
vote
being
taken
in
the
presence
of
the
mayor
aldermen
and
many
of
the
burgesses
john

and
andrew
marvell
were
declared
duly
elected
nobody
glancing
his
eye
over
a
list
of
the
knights
and
burgesses
who
made
up
richard
cromwell
first
and
last
parliament
would
ever
guess
that
it
represented
an
order
of
things
of
the
most
recent
date
which
was
just
about
to
disappear
on
paper
it
has
a
solid
look
the
fine
old
crusted
parliamentary
names
with
which
the
clerks
were
to
remain
so
long
familiar
as
the
members
trooped
out
to
divide
were
more
than
well
represented
the
drakes
of
amersham
were
there
boscawens

and

mildmays

up

with
the

in
their
pockets
a
less
revolutionary
assembly
never
met
though
there
was
a
regicide
or
two
among
them
but
when
the
members
found
themselves
alone
together
there
was
some
loose
talk
on
the
of
january
marvell
attended
for
the
first
time
in
his
place
when
the
new
protector
opened
parliament
and
made
a
speech
in
the
house
of
lords
which
was
pronounced
at
the
time
to
be
a
very
handsome
oration
the
first
business
of
the
commons
was
to
elect
a
speaker
nor
was
their
choice
a
very
lucky
one
for
it
first
fell
on
chaloner
chute
who
speedily
breaking
down
in
health
the
recorder
of
london
was
appointed
his
substitute
but
the
recorder
being
on
his
deathbed
at
the
time
and
chute
dying
very
shortly
afterwards
thomas
bampfield
was
elected
speaker
and
continued
so
to
be
until
the
parliament
was
dissolved
by
proclamation
on
the
of
april
this
proclamation
was
richard
cromwell
last
act
of
state
marvell
first
parliament
was
both
short
and
inglorious
one
only
of
its
resolutions
is
worth
quoting
that
a
very
considerable
navy
be
forthwith
provided
and
put
to
sea
for
the
safety
of
the
commonwealth
and
the
preservation
of
the
trade
and
commerce
thereof
it
was
however
the
army
and
not
the
navy
that
had
to
be
reckoned
with
an
army
unpaid
angry
suspicious
and
happily
divided
i
must
not
trace
the
history
of
faction
there
is
no
less
exalted
page
in
english
history
since
the
days
of
stephen
monk
is
its
fitting
hero
and
charles
the
second
its
expensive
saviour
of
society
the
story
how
the
restoration
was
engineered
by
general
monk
who
if
vulgar
was
adroit
both
on
land
and
sea
is
best
told
from
monk
point
of
view
in
the
concluding
chapter
of
sir
roger
de
favourite
sunday
reading
whilst
that
remnant
who
still
love
to
read
history
for
fun
may
not
object
to
be
told
that
they
will
find
printed
in
the
report
of
the
papers
manuscripts
a
of
the
by
john
collins
the
chief
butler
of
the
inner
temple
proving
in
great
and
highly
diverting
detail
how
this
remarkable
event
was
really
the
work
not
so
much
of
monk
as
of
the
chief
butler
richard
cromwell
having
slipped
the
collar
the
officers
assumed
command
as
they
were
only
too
ready
to
do
and
recalled
the
old
dishonoured
but
pertinacious
rump
parliament
which
though
mustering
at
first
but
members
at
once
began
to
talk
and
keep
journals
as
if
nothing
had
happened
since
the
day
ten
years
before
when
it
was
sent
about
its
business
old
speaker
lenthall
was
routed
out
of
obscurity
and
much
against
his
will
and
despite
his
protests
clapped
once
more
into
the
chair
john
owen
an
old
parliamentary
preaching
hand
was
once
again
requisitioned
to
preach
before
the
house
which
he
did
at
enormous
length
one
fine
sunday
in
may
the
rump
did
not
prove
a
popular
favourite
it
was
worse
than
old
noll
himself
who
could
at
least
thrash
both
dutchman
and
spaniard
and
be
even
more
feared
abroad
than
he
was
hated
at
home
the
city
of
london
then
almost
an
estate
of
the
realm
declared
for
a
free
parliament
and
it
soon
became
apparent
to
every
one
that
the
whole
country
was
eager
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
old
mould
nothing
now
stood
between
charles
and
his
own
but
half
a
dozen
fierce
old
soldiers
and
their
dubious
discontented
unpaid
men
it
was
once
commonly
supposed
it
is
so
no
longer
that
the
restoration
party
was
exclusively
composed
of
dispossessed
cavaliers
bishops
in
hiding
ejected
parsons
episcopalians
talkative
and
the
great
crowd
cruelly
repressed
under
the
rule
of
the
saints
had
it
been
left
to
these
ragged
regiments
the
issue
would
have
been
doubtful
and
the
result
very
different
the
presbyterian
ministers
who
occupied
the
rectories
and
vicarages
of
the
church
of
england
and
their
flocks
in
both
town
and
country
were
with
but
few
exceptions
all
for
king
charles
and
a
restored
monarchy
in
this
the
ministers
may
have
shown
a
sound
political
instinct
for
none
of
them
had
any
more
mind
than
the
anglican
bishops
to
tolerate
papists
socinians
quakers
and
fifth
monarchy
men
but
in
their
management
of
the
business
of
the
restoration
these
divines
exposed
themselves
to
the
same
condemnation
that
clarendon
in
an
passage
passed
upon
his
own
clerical
allies
when
read
by
the
light
of
the
act
of
uniformity
the
corporation
the
five
mile
and
the
conventicle
acts
the
conduct
of
the
presbyterians
seems
recklessness
itself
whilst
the
ignorance
their
ministers
displayed
of
the
temper
of
the
people
they
had
lived
amongst
all
their
lives
and
whom
they
adjured
to
cry
save
the
but
not
to
drink
his
majesty
health
because
was
forbidden
in
the
old
testament
would
be
startling
were
it
not
so
eminently
characteristic
the
rump
amidst
the
ridicule
and
contempt
of
the
populace
was
again
expelled
by
military
force
on
the
of
october
the
officers
were
divided
in
opinion
some
supporting
others
headed
by
lambert
opposing
the
parliament
but
or
superior
cunning
was
on
the
side
of
lambert
who
placed
his
soldiers
in
the
streets
leading
to
westminster
hall
and
when
the
speaker
came
in
his
coach
his
horses
were
turned
and
he
was
conducted
very
civilly
home
the
regiments
that
should
have
resisted
observing
that
they
were
exposed
to
derision
peaceably
returned
to
their
quarters
monk
in
the
meanwhile
was
advancing
with
his
army
from
edinburgh
and
affected
not
to
approve
of
the
force
put
upon
parliament
the
feeling
for
a
free
parliament
increased
in
strength
and
violence
every
day
the
rump
was
for
a
third
time
restored
in
december
by
the
section
of
the
london
army
that
supported
its
claim
lenthall
was
once
more
in
the
chair
and
the
journals
were
resumed
without
the
least
notice
of
past
occurrences
monk
having
reached
london
amidst
great
excitement
went
down
to
the
house
and
delivered
an
ambiguous
speech
up
to
the
last

seems
to
have
remained
uncertain
what
to
do
the
temper
of
the
city
which
was
fiercely
may
have
decided
him
at
all
events
he
invited
the
secluded
that
is
the
expelled
members
of
the
old
long
parliament
to
take
their
seats
along
with
the
others
and
in
a
formal
declaration
addressed
to
parliament
dated
the
of
february
he
counselled
it
among
other
things
to
dissolve
legally
in
order
to
make
way
for
a
succession
of
parliaments
in
a
word
monk
declared
for
a
free
parliament
great
indeed
were
the
national
rejoicings
on
the
of
march
a
bill
was
read
a
third
time
dissolving
the
parliament
begun
and
holden
at
westminster
november
and
for
the
calling
and
holding
of
a
parliament
at
westminster
on
the
of
april
this
time
an
end
was
really
made
of
the
rump
though
for
many
a
long
day
there
were
parliamentary
pedants
to
be
found
in
the
land
ready
to
maintain
that
the
long
parliament
had
never
been
legally
dissolved
and
still
existed
so
long
i
presume
as
any
single
member
of
it
remained
alive
marvell
was
not
a
rumper
but
on
the
of
april
he
was
again
elected
for
hull
to
sit
in
what
is
usually
called
the
convention
parliament
john
ramsden
was
returned
at
the
head
of
the
poll
with
votes

receiving
there
were

defeated
candidates

begins
marvell
remarkable
correspondence
on
fine
folio
sheets
of
paper
with
the
corporation
of
hull
whose
faithful
servant
he
remained
until
death
parted
them
in
this
correspondence
which
if
we
include
in
it
as
we
well
may
the
letters
to
the
worshipful
society
of
masters
and
pilots
of
the
trinity
house
in
hull
numbers
upwards
of
letters
and
with
but
one
considerable
gap
from
july
to
october
covers
the
whole
period
of
marvell
membership
is
i
believe
unique
in
our
public
records
the
letters
are
preserved
at
hull
where
i
hope
care
is
taken
to
preserve
them
from
the
autograph
hunter
and
the
autograph
thief
captain
thompson
printed
a
great
part
of
this
correspondence
in
and
grosart
gave
the
world
the
whole
of
it
in
the
second
volume
of
his
edition
of
marvell
complete
works
an
admission
may
as
well
be
made
at
once
this
correspondence
is
not
so
interesting
as
it
might
have
been
expected
to
prove
marvell
did
not
write
letters
for
his
biographer
nor
to
instruct
posterity
nor
to
serve
any
party
purpose
nor
even
to
exhibit
honest
emotion
but
simply
to
tell
his
employers
whose
wages
he
took
what
was
happening
at
westminster
he
kept
his
reflections
either
to
himself
or
for
his
political
broadsheets
and
indeed
they
were
seldom
of
the
kind
it
would
have
been
safe
to
entrust
to
the
post
good
grosart
fusses
and
frets
terribly
over
marvell
astonishing
capacity
for
chronicling
in
sombre
silence
every
kind
of
legislative
abomination
it
is
at
times
a
little
hard
to
understand
it
for
hull
was
what
may
be
called
a
puritan
place
no
doubt
caution
dictated
some
of
the
reticence
but
the
reserve
of
marvell
character
is
one
of
the
few
traits
of
his
personality
that
has
survived
he
was
a
satirist
not
an
enthusiast
i
will
give
the
first
letter
to
serve
as
a
specimen
and
a
very
favourable
one
of
the
whole
correspondence
gentlemen
my
worthy
friends
although
during
the
necessary
absence
of
my
partner
ramsden
i
write
with
but
halfe
a
penn
and
can
scarce
perswade
myselfe
to
send
you
so
imperfect
an
account
of
your
own
and
the
publick
affairs
as
i
needs
must
for
want
of
his
assistance
yet
i
had
rather
expose
mine
own
defects
to
your
good
interpretation
then
excuse
thereby
a
totall
neglect
of
my
duty
and
that
trust
which
is
divided
upon
me
at
my
late
absence
out
of
town
i
had
taken
such
order
that
if
you
had
commanded
me
any
thing
i
might
soon
haue
received
it
and
so
returned
on
purpose
to
this
place
to
haue
obeyed
you
but
hearing
nothing
of
that
nature
howeuer
i
was
present
the
first
day
of
the
parliament
sitting
and
tooke
care
to
write
to
maior
what
work
we
had
cut
out
since
when
we
have
had
little
new
but
onely
been
making
a
progresse
in
those
things
i
then
mentioned
there
is
yet
brought
in
an
act
in
which
of
all
others
your
corporation
is
the
least
concerned
that
is
where
wives
shall
refuse
to
cohabit
with
their
husbands
that
in
such
case
the
husband
shall
not
be
liable
to
pay
any
debts
which
she
may
run
into
for
clothing
diet
lodging
or
other
expenses
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
you
were
no
more
touched
in
a
vote
that
we
haue
made
for
bringing
in
an
act
of
a
new
assessment
for
six
moneths
of
to
begin
next
january
the
truth
is
the
delay
ere
monyes
can
be
got
in
eats
up
a
great
part
of
all
that
is
levying
and
that
growing
charge
of
the
army
and
navy
doubles
upon
us
and
that
is
all
that
can
be
said
for
excuse
of
ourselues
to
the
country
to
whom
we
had
giuen
our
own
hopes
of
no
further
sessment
to
be
raised
but
must
now
needs
incurre
the
censure
of
improvidence
before
or
prodigality
now
though
it
becomes
no
private
member
the
resolution
having
passed
the
house
to
interpose
further
his
own
judgment
in
a
thing
that
can
not
be
remedied
and
it
will
be
each
man
ingenuity
not
to
grudge
an
for
that
settlement
and
freedome
from
armyes
and
navyes
which
before
he
would
haue
been
glad
to
purchase
with
his
whole
fortune
there
remain
some
eight
regiments
to
be
disbanded
but
those
all
horse
in
a
manner
and
some
seauenteen
shipps
to
be
payd
of
that
haue
laid
so
long
upon
charge
in
the
harbour
beside
fourscore
shipps
which
are
reckoned
to
us
for
this
winter
guard
but
after
that
all
things
are
to
go
upon
his
majestye
own
purse
out
of
the
tunnage
and
poundage
and
his
other
revenues
but
there
being
so
great
a
provision
made
for
mony
i
doubt
not
but
ere
we
rise
to
see
the
whole
army
disbanded
and
according
to
the
act
hope
to
see
your
town
once
more
ungarrisond
in
which
i
should
be
glad
and
happy
to
be
instrumentall
to
the
uttermost
for
i
can
not
but
remember
though
then
a
child
those
blessed
days
when
the
youth
of
your
own
town
were
trained
for
your
militia
and
did
methought
become
their
arms
much
better
than
any
soldiers
that
i
haue
seen
there
since
and
it
will
not
be
amisse
if
you
please
now
that
we
are
about
a
new
act
of
regulating
the
militia
that
it
may
be
as
a
standing
strength
but
not
as
ill
as
a
perpetuall
army
to
the
nation
to
signify
to
me
any
thing
in
that
matter
that
were
according
to
your
ancient
custome
and
desirable
for
you
for
though
i
can
promise
little
yet
i
intend
all
things
for
your
service
the
act
for
review
of
the
poll
bill
proceeds
and
that
for
making
this
declaration
of
his
majesty
a
law
in
religious
matters
order
likewise
is
giuen
for
drawing
up
all
the
votes
made
during
our
last
sitting
in
the
businesse
of
sales
of
bishops
and
deans
and
chapters
lands
into
an
act
which
i
should
be
glad
to
see
passed
the
purchasers
the
other
day
offerd
the
house
in
ready
mony
and
to
make
the
bishops
revenue
as
good
or
better
then
before
but
the
house
thought
it
not
fit
or
seasonable
to
hearken
to
it
we
are
so
much
the
more
concernd
to
see
that
great
interest
of
the
purchasers
satisfyed
and
quieted
at
least
in
that
way
which
our
own
votes
haue
propounded
on
munday
next
we
are
to
return
to
the
consideration
of
apportioning
per
annum
upon
all
the
lands
in
the
nation
in
lieu
of
the
court
of
wards
the
debate
among
the
countyes
each
thinking
it
self
overrated
makes
the
successe
of
that
businesse
something
casuall
and
truly
i
shall
not
assist
it
much
for
my
part
for
it
is
little
reason
that
your
town
should
contribute
in
that
charge
the
excise
bill
for
longer
continuance
i
wish
it
proue
not
too
long
will
come
in
also
next
weeke
and
i
foresee
we
shall
be
called
upon
shortly
to
effect
our
vote
made
the
former
sitting
of
raising
his
majestie
revenue
to
per
annum
i
do
not
love
to
write
so
much
of
this
mony
news
but
i
think
you
haue
observed
that
parliaments
have
been
always
made
use
of
to
that
purpose
and
though
we
may
buy
gold
too
deare
yet
we
must
at
any
rate
be
glad
of
peace
freedom
and
a
good
conscience
maior
tells
me
your
duplicates
of
the
poll
are
coming
up
i
shall
go
with
them
to
the
exchequer
and
make
your
excuse
if
any
be
requisite
my
long
silence
hath
made
me
now
trespasse
on
the
other
hand
in
a
long
letter
but
i
doubt
not
of
your
good
construction
of
so
much
familiarity
and
trouble
from
gentlemen
your
most
affectionate
friend
and
servant
andr
marvell
westminster
although
this
first
letter
of
the
hull
correspondence
is
dated
the
of
november
the
convention
parliament
began
its
sittings
on
the
of
april
in
composition
this
convention
parliament
was
very
like
richard
cromwell
and
indeed
it
contained
many
of
the
same
members
whose
loyalty
however
was
less
restrained
than
in
all
the
world
knew
what
brought
this
parliament
together
it
was
to
make
the
peace
with
its
king
either
on
terms
or
without
terms
we
are
all
royalists
now
are
words
which
must
often
have
been
on
the
lips
of
the
members
of
this
house
one
can
imagine
the
smiles
half
grim
half
ironical
that
would
accompany
their
utterance
such
a
could
never
be
dignified
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
reminded
of
schoolboys
at
the
inevitable
end
of
a
barring
out
the
sarcastic
comment
of
clarendon
has
not
lost
its
sting
from
this
time
there
was
such
an
emulation
and
impatience
in
lords
commons
and
city
and
generally
over
the
kingdom
who
should
make
the
most
lively
expressions
of
their
duty
and
of
their
joy
that
a
man
could
not
but
wonder
where
those
people
dwelt
who
had
done
all
the
mischief
and
kept
the
king
so
many
years
from
enjoying
the
comfort
and
support
of
such
excellent
subjects
the
most
significant
sentence
in
marvell
first
letter
to
his
constituents
is
that
in
which
he
refers
to
the
bill
for
making
declaration
in
religious
matters
the
law
of
the
land
had
the
passing
of
any
such
bill
been
possible
how
different
the
history
of
england
would
have
been
the
declaration
marvell
is
referring
to
was
contained
in
the
famous
message
from
breda
which
was
addressed
by
charles
to
all
his
loving
subjects
of
what
degree
or
quality
and
was
expressed
as
follows
and
because
the
passion
and
uncharitableness
of
the
times
have
produced
several
opinions
in
religion
by
which
men
are
engaged
in
parties
and
animosities
against
each
other
which
when
they
shall
hereafter
unite
in
a
freedom
of
conversation
will
be
composed
or
better
understood
we
do
declare
a
liberty
to
tender
consciences
and
that
no
man
shall
be
disquieted
or
called
in
question
for
differences
of
opinion
in
matters
of
religion
which
do
not
disturb
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
and
that
we
shall
be
ready
to
consent
to
such
an
act
of
parliament
as
upon
mature
deliberation
shall
be
offered
to
us
for
the
full
granting
of
that
indulgence
it
is
only
doing
the
king
bare
justice
to
say
that
he
was
always
ready
and
willing
to
keep
this
part
of
his
royal
word
but
it
proved
an
impossibility
a
roman
catholic
as
a
matter
of
creed
a
hobbist
in
conversation
a
sensualist
in
practice
and
the
shrewdest
though
most
indolent
of
cynics
in
council
charles
in
this
matter
of
religious
toleration
would
gladly
have
kept
his
word
not
indeed
because
it
was
his
word
for
on
the
point
of
honour
he
was
indifferent
but
because
it
jumped
with
his
humour
and
would
have
mitigated
the
hard
lot
of
the
catholics
charles
was
not
a
theorist
all
his
tastes
being
eminently
practical
not
to
say
scientific
he
was
not
a
tyrant
but
a
man
from
head
to
heel
for
the
of
the
english
episcopate
he
cared
as
little
as
oliver
had
ever
done
for
the
of
the
english
crown
oliver
once
said
and
he
was
not
given
to
that
he
would
fire
his
pistol
at
the
king
as
soon
as
at
another
if
he
met
him
in
battle
and
the
second
charles
would
have
thought
no
more
of
beheading
an
anglican
bishop
than
he
did
of
sending
sir
harry
vane
to
the
scaffold
honesty
and
virtue
on
the
rare
occasions
charles
encountered
them
he
admired
much
as
a
painter
admires
the
colours
of
a
fine
sunset
above
everything
else
charles
was
determined
never
again
if
he
could
help
it
to
be
sent
on
his
travels
to
be
snubbed
and
starved
in
foreign
courts
sir
thomas
urquhart
of
cromartie
the
first
and
best
translator
of
rabelais
is
said
to
have
died
of
laughing
on
hearing
of
the
restoration
charles
did
not
die
but
he
must
have
laughed
inwardly
at
the
spectacle
that
met
his
eyes
everywhere
as
he
made
his
progress
from
dover
to
london
and
examined
the
gorgeous
beds
and
quilts
fine
linen
and
carpets
couches
horses
and
liveries
his
faithful
commons
had
been
at
the
pains
and
at
the
expense
of
providing
for
his
comfort
a
few
years
afterwards
marvell
wrote
the
following
lines
of
a
tall
stature
and
of
sable
hue
much
like
the
son
of
kish
that
lofty
jew
twelve
years
complete
he
suffered
in
exile
and
kept
his
father
asses
all
the
while
at
length
by
wonderful
impulse
of
fate
the
people
called
him
home
to
help
the
state
and
what
is
more
they
sent
him
money
too
to
clothe
him
all
from
head
to
foot
anew
nor
did
he
such
small
favours
then
disdain
who
in
his
thirtieth
year
began
his
reign
the
small
favours
grew
in
size
year
by
year
why
it
was
impossible
for
charles
to
keep
his
word
may
be
read
in
clarendon
and
in
the
history
of
the
savoy
conference
and
need
not
be
restated
here
in
the
opinion
of
the
anglican
clergy
the
divine
right
stood
no
higher
than
their
own
they
too
had
suffered
in
exile
they
had
been
robbed
of
their
tithes
and
turned
out
of
their
palaces
rectories
and
vicarages
and
excluded
from
the
churches
they
still
called
theirs
their
book
of
common
prayer
was
no
longer
in
common
use
having
been
banished
by
the
directory
of
public
worship
since
so
late
as
july
pepys
records
attending
a
service
in
the
abbey
and
adds
no
common
prayer
yet
if
we
find
ourselves
wondering
why
the
anglican
party
should
have
been
so
powerful
in
our
wonder
ought
not
to
be
greater
than
is
excited
by
the
power
of
the
puritan
party
when
laud
was
put
to
death
both
parties
were
on
each
occasion
in
a
minority
though
england
has
never
been
long
it
has
often
been
the
convention
parliament
did
all
that
was
expected
of
it
it
was
however
irregularly
summoned
a
truly
representative
assembly
its
members
all
swore
what
will
not
members
of
parliament
swear
that
the
king
was
supreme
in
church
and
state
the
only
rightful
king
of
the
realm
and
of
all
other
his
dominions
and
that
from
their
hearts
they
abhorred
detested
and
abjured
the
damnable
doctrine
that
princes
excommunicated
or
deprived
of
the
pope
might
be
murdered
by
their
subjects
they
proceeded
to
pass
a
very
useful
act
of
indemnity
and
oblivion
agreeing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
except
in
certain
named
cases
they
ordered
john
milton
to
be
taken
into
custody
and
prosecuted
which
he
never
was
by
the
later
on
the
poet
was
released
from
custody
and
we
find
marvell
complaining
to
the
house
that
their
sergeant
had
extracted
in
fees
before
he
would
let
milton
go
on
which
sir
heneage
finch
afterwards
lord
chancellor
laconically
observed
that
milton
deserved
hanging
he
certainly
got
off
easily
but
as
he
lived
to
publish
and
he
may
be
said
to
have
earned
his
freedom
all
his
poetry
put
together
never
brought
him
in
a
third
of
the
sum
the
sergeant
got
for
letting
him
out
of
prison
general
monk
the
who
so
skilfully
assisted
at
that
great
birth
of
time
the
restoration
was
made
a
duke
and
cromwell
army
so
long
the
force
behind
the
supreme
power
was
paid
its
arrears
and
two
regiments
excepted
disbanded
fifty
thousand
men
says
macaulay
accustomed
to
the
profession
of
arms
were
thrown
upon
the
world
in
a
few
months
there
remained
not
a
trace
indicating
that
the
most
formidable
army
in
the
world
had
just
been
absorbed
in
the
mass
of
the
community
after
this
the
house
of
commons
fell
to
discussing
religion
and
made
the
sad
discovery
that
differences
of
opinion
still
existed
in
these
circumstances
they
decided
to
refer
the
matter
to
their
pious
king
and
to
such
divines
as
he
might
choose
they
then
voted
large
sums
of
money
for
the
royal
establishment
and
it
being
the
very
end
of
august
adjourned
till
the
of
november
as
for
making
constitutional
terms
with
the
king
they
never
attempted
it
though
sir
matthew
hale
is
credited
with
an
attempt
to
induce
them
to
do
so
any
proposals
of
the
kind
must
have
failed
the
people
were
in
no
mood
for
making
constitutions
having
met
again
on
the
of
november
marvell
in
a
letter
to
the
mayor
and
aldermen
of
hull
dated
the
of
the
month
reports
that
the
house
fell
upon
the
making
out
of
the
king
revenue
to
a
year
the
customs
are
estimated
toward
per
annum
in
the
revenue
his
lands
and
fee
farms
the
excise
of
beer
and
ale
the
rest
arise
out
of
the
post
office
wine
licenses
stannaries
court
probate
of
wills
forests
and
other
rights
of
the
crown
the
excise
of
foreign
commodities
is
to
be
continued
apart
until
satisfaction
of
public
debts
and
engagements
secured
upon
the
excise
this
settlement
of
revenue
marks
the
beginning
of
a
time
cromwell
as
cowley
puts
it
in
his
by
far
the
ablest
indictment
of
oliver
ever
penned
took
armes
against
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
raised
them
himself
to
above
two
millions
it
is
true
cromwell
spent
the
money
honestly
and
efficiently
and
chiefly
on
a
navy
that
enabled
him
to
wrest
the
command
of
the
sea
from
the
dutch
to
secure
the
carrying
trade
and
to
challenge
the
world
for
supremacy
in
the
indies
both
east
and
west
in
doing
this
he
had
the
instinct
of
the
whole
nation
behind
him
but
it
was
expensive
had
charles
been
the
most
honest
and
thrifty
of
men
instead
of
one
of
the
most
dishonest
and
extravagant
he
must
have
found
his
financial
position
a
very
difficult
one
he
was
poorer
than
cromwell
the
feudal
taxation
had
fallen
into
desuetude
to
revive
wardships
was
impossible
to
recover
arrears
hopeless
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
scientific
taxation
one
of
his
first
acts
contains
a
schedule
of
taxed
articles
extending
over
fifteen
pages
of
a
quarto
volume
to
raise
this
revenue
was
difficult
in
fact
impossible
and
the
amount
actually
obtained
was
always
far
below
the
estimates
marvell
letter
concludes
thus
is
the
bill
for
enacting
his
majesty
declaration
in
religious
matters
and
to
have
its
first
reading
it
is
said
that
on
sunday
next
doctor
reynolds
shall
be
created
bishop
of
norwich
the
rumour
about
reynolds
bishopric
proved
to
be
true
the
new
bishop
was
a
very
moderate
anglican
indeed
and
his
appointment
was
meant
as
a
sop
to
the
presbyterians
richard
baxter
and
edmund
calamy
refused
similar
preferment
on
the
of
november
marvell
letter
contains
the
following
passage
yesterday
the
bill
of
the
king
declaration
in
religious
matters
was
read
for
the
first
time
but
upon
the
question
for
a
second
reading
was
carried
against
in
the
negative
so
there
is
an
end
of
that
bill
and
for
those
excellent
things
therein
we
must
henceforth
rely
only
upon
his
majesty
goodness
who
i
must
needs
say
hath
hitherto
been
more
ready
to
give
than
we
to
receive
it
is
a
noticeable
feature
of
this
correspondence
that
marvell
seldom
mentions
which
way
he
voted
himself
the
letter
of
the
of
december
contains
some
interesting
matter
gentlemen
since
my
last
upon
thursday
the
bill
for
vicarages
hath
been
carryed
up
to
the
lords
and
a
message
to
them
from
our
house
that
they
would
expedite
the
bill
for
confirmation
of
magna
charta
that
for
confirmation
of
marriages
and
other
bills
of
publick
concernment
which
haue
laid
by
them
euer
since
our
last
sitting
not
returned
to
us
we
had
then
the
bill
for
six
moneths
assesment
in
consideration
and
read
the
bill
for
taking
away
court
of
wards
and
purveyance
and
establishing
the
moiety
of
the
excise
of
beere
and
ale
in
perpetuum

which
we
sit

cool
reporting
of
the
hideous
indignity
inflicted
upon
his
old
master
and
allowing
it
to
pass
is
one
of
the
many
occasions
that
stirred
grosart
wonder
nerves
were
tough
in
those
days
pepys
tells
us
unconcernedly
enough
how
after
seeing
lord
southampton
sworn
in
at
the
court
of
exchequer
as
lord
treasurer
he
noticed
the
heads
of
cromwell
bradshaw
and
ireton
set
up
at
the
further
end
of
westminster
hall
it
is
quite
possible
lady
fauconberg
may
have
seen
the
same
sight
the
convention
parliament
was
dissolved
on
the
of
december
on
april
marvell
was
returned
for
the
third
and
last
time
for
hull
for
charles
the
second
first
parliament
was
of
unconscionable
long
duration
not
being
dissolved
till
january
after
death
it
is
known
in
history
as
the
pensionary
or
long
parliament
the
election
figures
were
as
below
colonel
gilbey
andrew
marvell
edward
barnard
john
ramsden
marvell
was
not
present
at
or
before
the
election
for
on
the
of
april
he
writes
i
perceive
by
mayor
that
you
have
again
as
if
it
were
grown
a
thing
of
course
made
choice
of
me
now
the
third
time
to
serve
for
you
in
parliament
which
as
i
can
not
attribute
to
anything
but
your
constancy
so
shall
i
god
willing
as
in
gratitude
obliged
with
no
less
constancy
and
vigour
continue
to
execute
your
commands
and
study
your
service
a
word
may
here
be
said
about
payment
of
borough
members
the
fee
was
for
every
day
the
parliament
lasted
the
wages
were
paid
by
the
corporation
out
of
the
borough
funds
it
was
never
a
popular
charge
burgesses
in
many
places
cared
as
little
for
as
do
some
of
their
successors
for
free
libraries
prynne
perhaps
the
greatest
parliamentary
lawyer
that
ever
lived
told
pepys
one
day
as
they
were
driving
to
the
temple
that
the
number
of
burgesses
to
be
returned
to
parliament
for
any
particular
borough
was
not
for
aught
prynne
could
find
fixed
by
law
but
was
at
first
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
sheriff
and
that
several
boroughs
had
complained
of
the
putting
them
to
the
charge
of
sending
up
burgesses
in
august
the
corporation
paid
marvell
for
his
fee
as
one
of
their
burgesses
being
a
day
for
days
the
length
of
the
convention
parliament
marvell
continued
to
take
his
wages
until
the
end
of
his
days
but
it
is
perhaps
a
mistake
to
suppose
he
was
the
very
last
member
to
do
so
it
was
however
unusual
in
marvell
time
this
pensionary
parliament
though
of
a
very
decided
church
and
king
complexion
was
not
in
its
original
composition
a
body
lacking
character
or
independence
but
it
steadily
deteriorated
in
both
respects
vacancies
as
they
occurred
and
they
occurred
very
frequently
in
those
days
of
short
lives
were
filled
up
by
courtiers
and
pensioners
in
the
small
tract
entitled
which
is
a
highly
libellous
dod
often
attributed
to
marvell
a
record
is
preserved
of
more
than
two
hundred
members
of
this
parliament
in
despite
some
humorous
touches
this
is
still
disagreeable
to
read
but
the
most
graphic
picture
we
have
of
this
parliament
is
to
be
found
in
one
of
lord
shaftesbury
political
tracts
entitled
a
letter
from
a
parliament
man
to
his
friend
sir
i
see
you
are
greatly
scandalized
at
our
slow
and
confused
proceedings
i
confess
you
have
cause
enough
but
were
you
but
within
these
walls
for
one
half
day
and
saw
the
strange
make
and
complexion
that
this
house
is
of
you
would
wonder
as
much
that
ever
you
wondered
at
it
for
we
are
such
a
pied
parliament
that
none
can
say
of
what
colour
we
are
for
we
consist
of
old
cavaliers
old
and
true
country
gentlemen
the
two
latter
are
most
numerous
and
would
in
probability
bring
things
to
some
issue
were
they
not
clogged
with
the
numerous
uncertainties
of
the
former
for
the
old
cavalier
grown
aged
and
almost
past
his
vice
is
damnable
godly
and
makes
his
doting
piety
more
a
plague
to
the
world
than
his
debauchery
was
for
he
is
so
much
a
to
the
b
ishop
that
he
forces
his
loyalty
to
strike
sail
to
his
religion
and
could
be
content
to
pare
the
nails
a
little
of
the
civil
government
so
you
would
but
let
him
sharpen
the
ecclesiastical
talons
which
behaviour
of
his
so
exasperates
the
that
he
on
the
other
hand
cares
not
what
increases
the
interest
of
the
crown
receives
so
he
can
but
diminish
that
of
the
miter
so
that
the
had
rather
enslave
the
man
than
the
conscience
the
cavalier
rather
the
conscience
than
the
man
there
being
a
sufficient
stock
of
animosity
as
proper
matter
to
work
upon
upon
these
therefore
the
courtier
mutually
plays
for
if
any
motion
be
made
he
gains
the
either
to
oppose
or
absent
by
telling
them
if
they
will
join
him
now
he
will
join
them
for
liberty
of
conscience
and
when
any
affair
is
started
on
behalf
of
the
country
he
assures
the
cavaliers
if
they
will
then
stand
by
him
he
will
then
join
with
them
in
promoting
a
bill
against
the
fanatics
thus
play
they
on
both
hands
wherefore
it
were
happy
that
he
had
neither
nor
cavalier
in
the
house
for
they
are
each
of
them
so
prejudicate
against
the
other
that
their
sitting
here
signifies
nothing
but
their
fostering
their
old
venom
and
lying
at
catch
to
stop
every
advantage
to
bear
down
each
other
though
it
be
in
the
destruction
of
their
country
for
if
the
bring
in
a
good
bill
the
old
cavalier
opposes
it
for
no
other
reason
but
because
they
brought
it
in
such
was
the
theatre
of
marvell
public
actions
for
the
rest
of
his
days
and
if
at
times
he
may
need
forgiveness
for
the
savagery
of
his
satire
it
ought
to
be
found
easy
to
forgive
him
the
two
members
for
hull
were
soon
immersed
in
matters
of
much
local
importance
they
began
by
quarrelling
with
one
another
marvell
writing
the
bond
of
civility
betwixt
gilby
and
myself
being
unhappily
snappt
in
pieces
and
in
such
manner
that
i
can
not
see
how
it
is
possible
ever
to
knit
them
again
house
of
commons
quarrels
are
usually
soon
made
up
and
so
was
this
one
the
custom
was
for
members
to
sign
these
letters
though
they
are
all
written
in
marvell
hand
but
if
this
was
for
any
reason
inconvenient
marvell
signed
alone
no
letters
unless
in
marvell
writing
are
preserved
at
hull
which
is
a
curious
fact
one
of
these
bits
of
local
business
related
to
a
patent
alleged
to
have
been
granted
by
the
crown
to
certain
persons
authorising
them
to
erect
and
maintain
in
the
various
ports
and
to
make
charges
in
respect
of
them
this
was
resented
by
the
members
for
the
ports
and
on
marvell
motion
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
committee
of
grievances
before
whom
the
patentees
were
summoned
when
they
came
it
appeared
that
the
patent
warranted
none
of
the
exactions
that
had
been
demanded
and
also
that
the
warrant
sent
down
to
hull
naming
these
charges
was
nothing
more
than
a
draft
framed
by
the
patentees
themselves
and
not
authorised
in
any
way
the
patent
was
at
once
suspended
marvell
like
a
true
member
of
parliament
wishes
to
get
any
little
local
credit
that
may
be
due
for
such
prompt
action
and
writes
in
this
thing
although
i
count
all
things
i
can
do
for
your
service
to
be
mere
trifles
and
not
worth
taking
notice
of
in
respect
of
what
i
owe
you
i
must
do
myself
that
right
to
let
you
know
that
i
and
i
alone
have
had
the
happiness
to
do
that
little
which
hitherto
is
effected
the
matter
required
delicate
handling
for
a
reason
marvell
gives
because
if
the
king
right
in
placing
such
impositions
should
be
weakened
neither
should
he
have
power
to
make
a
grant
of
them
to
you
another
much
longer
business
related
to
a
lighthouse
which
some
outsiders
were
anxious
to
build
in
the
humber
the
corporation
of
hull
acting
on
marvell
advice
had
petitioned
the
privy
council
and
were
asked
by
their
member
to
send
us
up
a
dormant
credit
for
an
hundred
pound
which
we
yet
indeed
have
no
use
of
but
if
need
be
must
have
ready
at
hand
to
reward
such
as
will
not
otherwise
befriend
your
business
some
months
later
marvell
forwards
an
account
not
of
the
but
of
the
legal
expenses
about
the
lighthouse
he
wishes
it
were
less
but
hopes
that
the
vigorous
resistance
will
discourage
the
designers
from
proceeding
farther
this
it
did
not
do
as
a
member
of
the
bar
i
find
two
or
three
of
the
items
in
this
bill
of
costs
interesting
to
scroggs
to
attend
the
council
again
for
the
same
spent
on
scroggs
at
dinner
to
scroggs
again
fees
of
the
council
table
fee
to
clerk
of
the
council
for
dinner
for
scroggs
and
wine
after
to
cresset
the
solicitor
to
scroggs
for
a
dinner
the
barrister
who
was
so
frequently
refreshed
by
marvell
lived
to
become
the
infamous
lord
chief
justice
scroggs
of
all
school
histories
a
week
before
the
prorogation
of
parliament
which
happened
on
the
of
may
marvell
went
to
holland
and
remained
there
for
nine
months
for
he
did
not
return
until
the
very
end
of
march
more
than
a
month
after
the
reassembling
of
the
house
what
took
him
there
nobody
knows
writing
to
the
trinity
house
about
the
lighthouse
business
on
the
of
may
marvell
says
but
that
which
troubles
me
is
that
by
the
interest
of
some
persons
too
potent
for
me
to
refuse
and
who
have
a
great
direction
and
influence
upon
my
counsels
and
fortune
i
am
obliged
to
go
beyond
sea
before
i
have
perfected
it
the
lighthouse
business
but
first
i
do
thereby
make
my
lord
carlisle
who
is
a
member
of
the
privy
council
and
one
of
them
to
whom
your
business
is
referred
absolutely
yours
and
my
journey
is
but
into
holland
from
whence
i
shall
weekly
correspond
as
if
i
were
at
london
with
all
the
rest
of
my
friends
towards
the
affecting
your
business
then
i
leave
gilbey
there
whose
ability
for
business
and
affection
to
yours
is
such
that
i
can
not
be
wanted
though
i
am
missing
it
is
plain
from
this
that
lord
carlisle
is
one
of
the
powerful
persons
referred
to
but
beyond
this
we
can
not
go
whilst
in
holland
marvell
wrote
both
to
the
trinity
house
and
to
the
corporation
on
business
matters
in
march
marvell
came
back
in
a
hurry
some
complaints
having
been
made
in
hull
about
his
absence
he
begins
his
first
letter
after
his
return
as
follows
being
newly
arrived
in
town
and
full
of
business
yet
i
could
not
neglect
to
give
you
notice
that
this
day
april
i
have
been
in
the
house
and
found
my
place
empty
though
it
seems
as
i
now
hear
that
some
persons
would
have
been
so
courteous
as
to
have
filled
it
for
me
in
none
of
these
letters
is
any
reference
made
to
the
debates
in
the
house
on
the
unhappy
bill
of
uniformity
nor
does
any
record
of
those
discussions
anywhere
exist
the
savoy
conference
proved
a
failure
and
no
lay
reader
of
baxter
account
of
it
can
profess
wonder
not
a
single
point
in
difference
was
settled
in
the
meantime
the
restored
houses
of
convocation
from
which
the
presbyterian
members
were
excluded
had
completed
their
revision
of
the
book
of
common
prayer
and
presented
it
to
parliament
in
considering
the
bill
for
uniformity
the
house
of
lords
where
presbyterianism
was
powerfully
represented
showed
more
regard
for
those
tender
consciences
to
which
the
king
by
the
new
prayer
book
called
for
the
first
time
our
most
religious
king
had
referred
in
his
breda
declaration
than
did
the
house
of
commons
the
book
the
whole
book
and
nothing
but
the
book
was
in
effect
the
cry
of
the
lower
house
and
on
the
of
may
ten
days
after
marvell
had
left
for
the
continent
the
act
of
uniformity
became
law
and
by
the
of
august
all
beneficed
ministers
and
schoolmasters
had
to
make
the
celebrated
subscription
and
profession
or
go
out
into
the
wilderness
there
has
always
been
a
dispute
as
to
the
physical
possibility
of
perusing
the
compilation
in
question
before
the
day
fixed
by
the
statute
the
book
was
advertised
for
sale
in
london
on
the
of
august
but
how
many
copies
were
actually
available
on
that
day
is
not
known
the
dean
and
chapter
of
peterborough
did
not
get
their
copies
until
the
of
august
when
the
new
folios
reached
the
lonely
parsonages
of
cumberland
and
durham
who
would
care
to
say
the
act
required
a
verbal
avowal
of
unfeigned
assent
and
consent
to
all
and
everything
contained
and
prescribed
in
and
by
the
book
of
common
prayer
and
administrations
of
the
sacraments
and
other
rites
and
ceremonies
of
the
church
according
to
the
use
of
the
church
of
england
together
with
the
psalter
and
the
form
of
manner
of
making
ordaining
and
consecrating
bishops
priests
and
deacons
to
be
made
after
the
service
upon
some
lord
day
before
the
feast
of
bartholomew
the
of
august
the
act
also
required
subscription
within
the
same
to
a
declaration
of
uniformity
to
the
liturgy
of
the
church
of
england
as
it
is
now
by
law
established
that
this
haste
was
indecent
no
layman
is
likely
to
dispute
but
that
it
wrought
practical
wrong
is
doubtful
the
vicar
of
bray
needed
no
time
to
read
his
new
folio
to
enable
him
to
make
whatever
avowal
concerning
it
the
law
demanded
and
as
for
signing
the
declaration
all
he
required
for
that
purpose
was
pen
and
ink
neither
had
the
incumbent
who
was
a
good
churchman
at
heart
any
doubts
to
settle
he
rejoiced
to
know
that
his
side
was
once
more
uppermost
and
that
it
would
be
no
longer
necessary
for
him
in
order
to
retain
his
living
to
pretend
to
tolerate
a
presbyterian
or
to
submit
to
read
in
his
church
the
directory
of
public
worship
convocation
had
approved
the
new
prayer
book
which
was
in
substance
the
old
one
and
what
more
did
any
churchman
require
as
for
the
presbyterians
and
others
who
were
in
possession
of
livings
the
failure
of
the
savoy
conference
must
have
made
it
plain
to
them
that
the
church
of
england
had
not
allowed
the
king
to
keep
his
word
that
compromise
and
comprehension
had
failed
and
that
if
they
were
to
remain
where
they
were
it
could
only
be
on
terms
of
completely
severing
themselves
from
all
other
protestant
bodies
in
the
world
and
becoming
thorough
episcopalians
no
presbyterian
of
any
eminence
was
prepared
to
make
the
statutory
avowal
painful
as
it
always
must
be
to
give
up
any
good
thing
by
a
fixed
date
it
is
hard
to
see
what
advantage
would
have
accrued
from
delay
when
the
day
came
some
two
thousand
parsons
were
turned
out
of
the
church
of
england
among
them
were
included
many
of
the
most
devout
and
some
of
the
most
learned
of
our
divines
their
coming
in
had
been
irregular
their
going
out
was
painful
save
so
far
as
it
turned
these
men
out
the
act
was
a
failure
it
did
not
procure
that
uniformity
in
the
public
worship
of
god
which
it
declared
was
so
desirable
it
prevented
no
scandal
it
arrested
no
decay
it
allayed
no
distemper
and
it
certainly
did
not
settle
the
peace
of
the
church
inside
the
church
the
bishops
were
supine
the
parochial
clergy
indifferent
and
the
worshippers
if
such
a
name
can
properly
be
bestowed
upon
the
congregations
were
grossly
irreverent
nor
was
any
improvement
in
the
conduct
of
the
church
service
noticeable
until
after
the
revolution
and
when
legislation
had
conceded
a
somewhat
shabby
measure
of
toleration
to
those
who
by
that
time
had
become
rigid
traditional
and
hereditary
dissenters
then
indeed
some
attempts
began
to
be
made
to
secure
a
real
uniformity
of
ritual
in
the
public
worship
of
the
church
of
england
how
far
success
has
rewarded
these
exertions
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
marvell
did
not
remain
long
at
home
after
his
return
from
holland
a
strange
adventure
lay
before
him
he
thus
introduces
it
in
a
letter
dated
june
gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
the
relation
i
have
to
your
affairs
and
the
intimacy
of
that
affection
i
ow
you
do
both
incline
and
oblige
me
to
communicate
to
you
that
there
is
a
probability
i
may
very
shortly
have
occasion
to
go
beyond
sea
for
my
lord
of
carlisle
being
chosen
by
his
majesty
embassadour
extraordinary
to
muscovy
sweden
and
denmarke
hath
used
his
power
which
ought
to
be
very
great
with
me
to
make
me
goe
along
with
him
secretary
in
those
embassages
it
is
no
new
thing
for
members
of
our
house
to
be
dispens
with
for
the
service
of
the
king
and
nation
in
forain
parts
and
you
may
be
sure
that
i
will
not
stirre
without
speciall
leave
of
the
house
that
so
you
may
be
freed
from
any
possibility
of
being
importuned
or
tempted
to
make
any
other
choice
in
my
absence
however
i
can
not
but
advise
also
with
you
desiring
to
take
your
assent
along
with
me
so
much
esteeme
i
have
both
of
your
prudence
and
friendship
the
time
allotted
for
the
embassy
is
not
much
above
a
yeare
probably
it
may
not
be
much
less
betwixt
our
adjournment
and
next
meeting
and
however
you
have
colonell
gilby
to
whom
my
presence
can
make
litle
addition
so
that
if
i
can
not
decline
this
voyage
i
shall
have
the
comfort
to
believe
that
all
things
considered
you
can
not
thereby
receive
any
disservice
i
shall
hope
to
receive
herein
your
speedy
answer
what
was
the
power
lord
carlisle
had
over
marvell
is
not
now
discoverable
but
the
tie
whatever
it
may
have
been
was
evidently
a
close
one
a
month
after
this
letter
marvell
started
on
his
way
gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
being
this
day
taking
barge
for
gravesend
there
to
embark
for
archangel
so
to
muscow
thence
for
sweden
and
last
of
all
denmarke
all
of
which
i
hope
by
blessing
to
finish
within
twelve
moneths
time
i
do
hereby
with
my
last
and
seriousest
thoughts
salute
you
rendring
you
all
hearty
thanks
for
your
great
kindnesse
and
friendship
to
me
upon
all
occasions
and
ardently
beseeching
god
to
keep
you
all
in
his
gracious
protection
to
your
own
honour
and
the
welfare
and
flourishing
of
your
corporation
to
which
i
am
and
shall
ever
continue
a
most
affectionate
and
devoted
servant
i
undertake
this
voyage
with
the
order
and
good
liking
of
his
majesty
and
by
leave
given
me
from
the
house
and
enterd
in
the
journal
and
having
received
moreover
your
approbation
i
go
therefore
with
more
ease
and
satisfaction
of
mind
and
augurate
to
myselfe
the
happier
successe
in
all
my
proceedings
it
was
marvell
good
fortune
to
be
in
lord
carlisle
frigate
which
made
the
voyage
to
archangel
in
less
than
a
month
sailing
from
gravesend
on
the
of
july
and
arriving
at
the
bar
of
archangel
on
the
of
august
the
companion
frigate
took
seven
weeks
to
compass
the
same
distance
nothing
of
any
importance
attaches
to
this
russian
embassy
it
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
took
up
a
great
deal
of
time
exposed
the
ambassador
and
his
suite
to
much
rudeness
and
discomfort
and
failed
to
effect
its
main
object
which
was
to
secure
a
renewal
of
the
privileges
formerly
enjoyed
in
muscovy
by
british
merchants
one
of
the
attendants
upon
the
ambassador
made
a
small
book
out
of
his
travels
which
did
not
get
printed
till
when
it
attracted
little
notice
grosart
was
the
first
of
marvell
many
biographers
to
discover
the
existence
of
this
narrative
he
found
it
in
the
first
instance
to
use
his
own
language
in
one
of
good
trusty
john
harris
folios
of
and
two
vols
folio
but
later
on
he
made
the
sad
discovery
that
this
good
trusty
john
harris
had
uplifted
what
he
called
his
true
and
particular
account
from
the
book
of
without
any
acknowledgment
for
ways
that
are
dark
the
old
compiler
of
travels
was
not
easily
excelled
but
why
should
grosart
have
gone
out
of
his
way
to
call
an
about
whom
he
evidently
knew
nothing
good
and
trusty
harris
was
never
either
the
one
or
the
other
and
died
a
pauper
a
journey
to
moscow
in
was
no
joke
lord
carlisle
who
was
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
eldest
son
although
ready
to
start
from
archangel
by
the
end
of
september
was
doomed
to
spend
both
the
of
november
and
christmas
day
in
the
gloomy
town
of
vologda
which
they
had
reached
travelling
by
water
on
the
of
october
some
of
this
time
was
spent
in
quarrelling
as
to
who
was
to
supply
the
sledges
that
were
required
to
convey
the
ambassador
and
all
his
along
the
now
roads
to
moscow
it
was
one
of
marvell
many
duties
to
remonstrate
with
the
authorities
for
their
cruel
and
disrespectful
indifference
he
did
so
with
great
freedom
but
with
no
effect
and
at
last
the
ambassador
was
obliged
to
hire
two
hundred
sledges
at
his
own
charges
sixty
he
sent
on
ahead
following
with
one
hundred
and
forty
on
the
of
january
it
was
an
intensely
cold
journey
and
the
accommodation
at
night
with
one
happy
exception
proved
quite
infamous
on
the
of
february
lord
carlisle
and
his
found
themselves
five
versts
from
moscow
the
of
february
was
fixed
for
their
entry
into
the
city
in
all
their
finery
they
were
ready
on
the
morning
of
that
day
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
tsar
escort
but
it
never
came
lord
carlisle
had
sent
his
cooks
on
to
moscow
to
prepare
the
dinner
he
expected
to
eat
in
his
nightfall
approached
and
it
was
not
till
half
an
hour
before
night
that
the
belated
messengers
arrived
full
of
excuses
the
ambassador
was
hungry
cold
and
furious
nor
did
his
anger
abate
when
told
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
enter
moscow
that
night
as
the
tsar
and
his
ladies
were
very
anxious
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
the
return
of
the
cooks
from
moscow
and
the
preparation
of
dinner
though
a
mitigation
was
no
cure
for
wounded
pride
and
lord
carlisle
calling
marvell
to
his
side
and
with
his
assistance
concocted
a
letter
in
latin
to
the
tsar
complaining
bitterly
of
their
fumosi
gurgustii
sordes
et
angustias
sine
cibo
aut
and
going
so
far
as
to
assert
that
had
anything
of
the
kind
happened
in
england
to
a
foreign
ambassador
the
king
of
england
would
never
have
rested
until
the
offence
had
been
atoned
for
with
the
blood
of
the
criminals
when
some
forty
years
afterwards
peter
the
great
asked
queen
anne
to
chop
off
the
heads
of
the
rude
men
who
had
arrested
his
ambassador
for
debt
he
had
perhaps
marvell
letter
before
him
on
the
of
february
lord
carlisle
and
his
suite
made
their
public
entry
into
moscow
but
so
long
a
time
was
occupied
over
the
few
versts
they
had
to
travel
that
it
was
dusk
before
the
kremlin
was
reached
the
formal
reception
of
the
ambassador
was
on
the
of
february
marvell
was
in
the
ambassador
sledge
and
carried
his
credentials
upon
a
yard
of
red
damask
the
titles
of
the
russian
potentate
would
if
printed
here
fill
half
a
page
all
the
russias
great
little
and
white
emperies
more
than
one
dukedoms
by
the
dozen
territories
countries
and
dominions
not
all
easy
to
identify
on
the
map
and
very
hard
to
pronounce
were
read
out
in
a
loud
voice
by
marvell
at
the
end
of
them
came
the
homely
title
of
the
earl
and
his
offices
his
majesty
lieutenant
in
the
counties
of
cumberland
and
westmorland
the
letters
read
and
delivered
the
tsar
and
his
boyars
rose
in
their
places
simultaneously
and
their
tissue
vests
made
so
strange
loud
and
unexpected
a
noise
as
to
provoke
the
ever
too
easily
moved
risibility
of
the
englishmen
when
marvell
and
the
rest
of
them
had
ceased
from
giggling
the
tsar
inquired
after
the
health
of
the
king
but
the
distance
between
his
imperial
majesty
and
lord
carlisle
being
too
great
for
the
question
to
carry
it
had
to
be
repeated
by
those
who
were
nearer
the
ambassador
who
gravely
replied
that
when
he
last
saw
his
master
namely
on
the
of
july
then
last
past
he
was
perfectly
well
to
the
same
question
as
to
the
health
of
the
desolate
widow
of
charles
the
first
carlisle
returned
the
same
cautious
answer
he
then
read
a
very
long
speech
in
english
which
his
interpreter
turned
into
russian
the
same
oration
was
rendered
into
latin
by
marvell
and
presented
over
marvell
latin
trouble
arose
for
the
russians
were
bent
on
taking
and
giving
offence
marvell
had
styled
the
tsar
when
he
ought
so
it
was
alleged
to
have
called
him
marvell
was
not
a
schoolmaster
son
an
old
scholar
of
trinity
and
milton
assistant
as
latin
secretary
for
nothing
he
prepared
a
reply
which
as
it
does
not
lack
humour
has
a
distinct
literary
flavour
and
is
all
that
came
of
the
embassy
may
here
be
given
at
length
i
reply
saith
he
that
i
sent
no
such
paper
into
the
but
upon
the
desire
of
his
tzarskoy
councellor
evan
offonassy
pronchissof
i
delivered
it
to
him
not
being
a
paper
of
state
nor
written
in
the
english
language
wherein
i
treat
nor
put
into
the
hands
of
the
near
boyars
and
councellors
of
his
tzarskoy
majesty
nor
subscribed
by
my
self
nor
translated
into
russe
by
my
interpreter
but
only
as
a
piece
of
curiosity
which
is
now
restored
me
and
i
am
possessed
of
it
so
that
herein
his
tzarskoy
majestie
near
boyars
and
councellors
are
doubtless
ill
grounded
but
again
i
say
concerning
the
value
of
the
words
and
compared
together
seeing
we
must
here
from
affaires
of
state
fall
into
grammatical
contests
concerning
the
latin
tongue
that
the
word
signifieth
nothing
but
still
and
calm
and
therefore
though
of
late
times
adopted
into
the
titles
of
great
princes
by
reason
of
that
benigne
tranquility
which
properly
dwells
in
the
majestick
countenance
of
great
princes
and
that
venerable
stillness
of
all
the
attendants
that
surround
them
of
which
i
have
seen
an
excellent
example
when
i
was
in
the
presence
of
his
tzarskoy
majesty
yet
is
more
properly
used
concerning
the
calmness
of
the
weather
or
season
so
that
even
the
night
is
elegantly
called
by
the
best
authors
cicero
in
arato
lucretius
and
upon
perusing
again
what
i
have
writ
in
this
paper
i
finde
that
i
have
out
of
the
customariness
of
that
expression
my
self
near
the
beginning
said
and
that
most
serene
night
whereas
on
the
contrary
in
its
proper
derivation
and
signification
expresseth
that
which
is
all
resplendent
lightsome
and
glorious
as
well
without
as
within
and
that
not
with
a
secondary
but
with
a
primitive
and
original
light
for
if
the
sun
be
as
he
is
the
first
fountain
of
light
and
poets
in
their
expressions
as
is
well
known
are
higher
by
much
than
those
that
write
in
prose
what
else
is
it
when
ovid
in
the
of
the
metamorphoses
saith
of
phoebus
speaking
with
phaëthon
terque
quaterque
concutiens
illustre
and
the
latin
orators
as
pliny
ep
when
they
would
say
the
highest
thing
that
can
be
exprest
upon
any
subject
word
it
thus
illustrius
dicere
so
that
hereby
may
appear
to
his
tzarskoy
majestie
near
boyars
and
counsellors
what
diminution
there
is
to
his
tzarskoy
majesty
which
farr
be
it
from
my
thoughts
if
i
appropriate
to
my
master
and
to
him
than
which
dici
potest
but
because
this
was
in
the
time
of
the
purity
of
the
latin
tongue
when
the
word
was
never
used
in
the
title
of
any
prince
or
person
i
shall
go
on
to
deale
with
the
utmost
candor
forasmuch
as
in
this
nation
the
nicety
of
that
most
eloquent
language
is
not
so
perfectly
understood
which
gives
occasion
to
these
mistakes
i
confess
therefore
that
indeed
in
the
declination
of
the
latin
tongue
and
when
there
scarce
could
be
found
out
words
enough
to
supply
the
modern
ambition
of
titles
serenissimus
as
several
other
words
hath
grown
in
fashion
for
a
compellation
of
lesser
as
well
as
greater
princes
and
yet
befits
both
the
one
and
the
other
so
there
is
respublica
even
as
the
word
highness
or
befits
a
duke
a
prince
a
king
or
an
emperour
adjoyning
to
it
the
respective
quality
and
so
the
word
but
suppose
it
were
by
modern
use
which
i
deny
depressed
from
the
undoubted
superiority
that
it
had
of
in
the
purest
antiquity
yet
being
added
in
the
transcendent
degree
to
the
word
emperour
the
highest
denomination
that
a
prince
is
capable
of
it
becomes
of
the
same
value
so
that
to
interpret
unto
diminution
is
to
find
a
positive
in
a
superlative
and
in
the
most
orient
light
to
seek
for
darkness
and
i
would
seeing
the
near
boyars
and
counsellors
of
his
tzarskoy
majesty
are
pleased
to
mention
the
title
given
to
his
tzarskoy
majesty
by
his
cesarian
majesty
gladly
be
satisfied
by
them
whether
ever
any
cesarian
majesty
writ
formerly
hither
in
and
whether
then
they
styled
his
tzarskoy
majesty
durchluchtigste
which
is
the
same
with
and
which
i
believe
the
cæsar
hath
kept
for
himself
but
to
cut
short
his
royal
majesty
hath
used
the
word
to
his
tzarskoy
majesty
in
his
letter
not
out
of
imitation
of
others
although
even
in
the
dutch
letter
to
his
tzarskoy
majesty
of
june
i
finde
durchlauchtigste
the
same
as
i
said
with
but
out
of
the
constant
use
of
his
own
court
further
joyning
before
it
most
high
most
potent
and
adding
after
it
great
lord
emperour
which
is
an
higher
title
than
any
prince
in
the
world
gives
his
tzarskoy
majesty
and
as
high
a
title
of
honour
as
can
be
given
to
any
thing
under
the
divinity
for
the
king
my
master
who
possesses
as
considerable
dominions
and
by
as
high
and
a
right
as
any
prince
in
the
universe
yet
contenting
himself
with
the
easiest
titles
and
satisfying
himself
in
the
essence
of
things
doth
most
willingly
give
to
other
princes
the
titles
which
are
appropriated
to
them
but
to
the
tzarskoy
majesties
of
russia
his
royal
ancestors
and
to
his
present
tzarskoy
majesty
his
royal
majesty
himself
have
usually
and
do
gladly
pay
titles
even
to
superfluity
out
of
meer
kindness
and
upon
that
reason
he
added
the
word
most
illustrious
and
so
did
i
use
it
in
the
latin
of
my
speech
yet
that
you
may
find
i
did
not
out
of
any
criticisme
of
honor
but
for
distinction
sake
use
it
as
i
did
you
may
see
in
one
place
of
the
same
speech
speaking
of
his
tzarskoy
majesty
and
i
would
have
used
an
hundred
times
concerning
his
tzarskoy
majesty
had
i
thought
it
would
have
pleased
him
better
and
i
dare
promise
you
that
his
majesty
will
upon
the
first
information
from
me
stile
him
and
i
notwithstanding
what
i
have
said
shall
make
little
difficulty
of
altering
the
word
in
that
speech
and
of
delivering
it
so
to
you
with
that
protestation
that
i
have
not
in
using
that
word
erred
nor
used
any
diminution
which
god
forbid
to
his
tzarskoy
majesty
but
on
the
contrary
after
the
example
of
the
king
my
master
intended
and
shewed
him
all
possible
honor
and
so
god
grant
all
happiness
to
his
most
high
most
potent
most
illustrious
and
most
serene
tzarskoy
majesty
and
that
the
friendship
may
daily
increase
betwixt
his
said
majesty
and
his
most
serene
majesty
my
master
on
the
of
february
the
tsar
invited
lord
carlisle
and
his
suite
to
a
dinner
which
beginning
at
two
lasted
till
eleven
when
it
was
prematurely
broken
up
by
the
tsar
nose
beginning
to
bleed
five
hundred
dishes
were
served
but
there
were
no
napkins
and
the
only
just
covered
the
boards
there
were
spanish
wines
white
and
red
mead
puaz
and
strong
waters
the
english
ambassador
was
not
properly
placed
at
table
not
being
anywhere
near
the
tsar
and
his
faithful
suite
shared
his
resentment
time
went
on
but
no
diplomatic
progress
was
made
the
tsar
would
not
renew
the
privileges
of
the
british
merchants
easter
was
spent
in
moscow
may
also
and
still
nothing
was
done
carlisle
in
a
huff
determined
to
go
away
and
somewhat
to
the
distress
of
his
followers
refused
to
accept
the
costly
sables
sent
by
the
tzar
not
only
to
the
ambassador
lady
carlisle
and
lord
morpeth
but
to
the
secretaries
and
others
the
tzar
thereupon
returned
the
plate
which
our
king
had
sent
him
which
plate
lord
carlisle
seems
to
have
appropriated
no
doubt
with
diplomatic
correctness
as
his
perquisite
in
lieu
of
the
sables
but
the
suite
got
nothing
the
embassy
left
moscow
on
the
of
june
for
novgorod
and
riga
and
after
visiting
stockholm
and
copenhagen
lord
carlisle
and
marvell
reached
london
on
the
of
january
during
marvell
absence
war
had
been
declared
with
the
dutch
it
was
never
difficult
to
go
to
war
with
the
dutch
the
king
was
always
in
want
of
money
and
as
no
proper
check
existed
over
war
supplies
he
took
what
he
wanted
out
of
them
the
merchants
on
desired
war
saying
that
the
trade
of
the
world
was
too
little
for
both
england
and
holland
and
that
one
or
the
other
must
down
the
english
manufacturers
who
felt
the
sting
of
their
dutch
competitors
were
always
in
favour
of
war
then
the
growing
insolence
of
the
dutch
in
the
indies
was
not
to
be
borne
stories
were
circulated
how
the
hollanders
had
proclaimed
themselves
lords
of
the
southern
seas
and
meant
to
deny
english
ships
the
right
of
entry
in
that
quarter
of
the
globe
a
baronet
called
on
pepys
and
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
letters
from
the
east
indies
full
of
sad
tales
of
englishmen
having
been
actually
thrashed
inside
their
own
factory
at
surat
by
swaggering
dutchmen
who
had
insulted
the
flag
of
george
and
swore
they
were
going
to
be
the
masters
out
there
pepys
who
knew
a
little
about
the
state
of
the
royal
navy
listened
sorrowfully
and
was
content
to
hope
that
the
war
would
not
come
until
we
are
more
ready
for
it
in
the
house
of
commons
the
prudent
men
were
against
the
war
and
were
at
once
accused
of
being
in
the
pay
of
the
dutch
the
king
friends
were
all
for
the
war
and
nobody
doubted
that
some
of
the
money
voted
for
it
would
find
its
way
into
their
pockets
or
at
all
events
that
pensions
would
reward
their
fidelity
a
third
group
who
favoured
the
war
were
supposed
to
do
so
because
their
disloyalty
and
fanaticism
always
disposed
them
to
trouble
the
waters
in
which
they
wished
to
fish
the
war
began
in
november
and
on
the
of
that
month
the
king
opened
parliament
and
demanded
money
he
got
it
clarendon
describes
how
sir
robert
paston
from
norfolk
a
man
who
was
no
frequent
speaker
but
delivered
what
he
had
a
mind
to
say
very
clearly
stood
up
and
proposed
a
grant
of
two
and
a
half
million
pounds
to
be
spread
over
three
years
so
huge
a
sum
took
the
house
by
surprise
nobody
spoke
they
sat
in
amazement
somebody
at
last
found
his
voice
and
moved
a
much
smaller
sum
but
no
one
seconded
him
sir
robert
paston
ultimately
found
supporters
no
man
who
had
any
relation
to
the
court
speaking
a
word
the
speaker
put
sir
robert
paston
motion
as
the
question
and
the
affirmative
made
a
good
sound
and
very
few
gave
their
negative
aloud
but
clarendon
adds
it
was
notorious
very
many
sat
silent
the
war
was
not
in
its
early
stages
unpopular

a
keen

his
unhappy
notions
as

its
exercise
were
fatal
to
an
efficient

on
the
of

the

had
his
one
victory
it
was
off

ten
days
after

the

appeared
in
london
a
terrible
and
a
solemnising
affliction
lasting
the
rest
of
the
year
it
was
at
its
worst
in
september

in
one
week
more
than
seven
thousand

upon

to

the
king
who
was
the
frankest
of
mortals
in
speech
though
false
as
belial
in
action
told
the
house
that
he
had
already
spent
all
the
money

and
must
have
more
especially
if

to

for
themselves
the
temper

notwithstanding
the
terrible
plight
of
the
capital

was
gaiety
itself
the

was
accompanied

acts

of
which
but
one
is
still
remembered
in
certain
quarters
the
five
mile
act
which
marvell
briefly
describes
as
an
act
for
debarring
ejected
nonconformists
from

corporations
where
they
had
formerly
pursued
their
callings
unless

on

the
of

pepys
was
aroused
by
one
of
his
at
to
look
at
a
fire
he
could
not
make
out
much
about
it
and
went
to
bed
again
but
when
he
rose
at
seven
it
was
still
burning
so
he
left
his
house
and
made
his
way
to
the
tower
from
whence
he
saw
london
bridge
aflame
and
describes
how
the
poor
pigeons
loth
to
leave
their
homes
fluttered
about
the
balconies
until
with
singed
wings
they
fell
into
the
flames
after
gazing
his
fill
he
went
to
whitehall
and
had
an
interview
with
the
king
who
at
once
ordered
his
barge
and
proceeded
downstream
to
his
burning
city
and
to
the
assistance
of
a
distracted
lord
mayor
the
fire
raged
four
days
and
made
an
end
of

picturesque
and
even
beautiful
city

the

by
the
of

smoking

four
hundred

just
a

an
hour
so
the
curious
noted
warehouses
unnumbered
with
all
their
varied
contents
whole

the

of

were
wiped
out
of

rents
to
an
enormous
amount

to
be
represented
any
longer
by
the
houses

them

to
get
his
how
were

their

the
parsons
on

the
of

to
have
had
no
difficulty
in
finding

pepys
went
to
church
twice
but
without
edification
and
certainly
dean

whom
he
heard
complaining
in
the
evening
that
the
city
had
been
reduced
from
a
folio
to
a
duo
decimo
hardly
rose
to
the
dignity
of
the
occasion
strange
to
say
not
a
life
was
actually
lost
in
the
fire
though
some
old
londoners
among
them
edmund
calamy
grandfather
died
of
grief
and
others
and
among
them
shirley
the
dramatist
and
his
wife
from
exposure
and
exhaustion
one
hysterical
foreigner
who
insisted
that
he
lit
the
flame
was
executed
though
no
sensible
man
believed
what
he
said
it
was
long
the
boast
of
the
merchants
of
london
that
no
one
of
their
number
broke
in
consequence
of
the
great
fire
unhappily
the
belief
was
widespread
as
that
tall
bully
the
monument
long
testified
that
the
fire
was
the
work
of
the
roman
catholics
and
aliens
suspected
of
belonging
to
our
old
religion
found
it
dangerous
to
walk
the
streets
whilst
the
embers
still
smoked
which
they
continued
to
do
for
six
months
the
meeting
of
parliament
was
a
little
delayed
in
consequence
of
this
national
disaster
and
when
it
did
meet
at
the
end
of
the
month
marvell
reports
the
appointment
of
two
committees
one
about
the
fire
of
london
and
the
other
to
receive
informations
of
the
insolence
of
the
popish
priests
and
jesuits
and
of
the
increase
of
popery
the
latter
committee
almost
at
once
reported
to
the
house
to
quote
from
letter
of
the
of
october
that
his
majesty
be
desired
to
issue
out
his
proclamation
that
all
popish
priests
and
jesuits
except
such
as
not
being
subjects
or
belong
to
the
queen
mother
and
queen
consort
be
banished
in
thirty
days
or
else
the
law
be
executed
upon
them
that
all
justices
of
peace
and
officers
concerned
put
the
laws
in
execution
against
papists
and
suspected
papists
in
order
to
their
execution
and
that
all
officers
civil
or
military
not
taking
the
oaths
of
supremacy
and
allegiance
within
twenty
days
be
displaced
in
a
very
real
sense
the
great
fire
of
london
continued
to
smoke
for
many
a
weary
year
and
to
fill
the
air
with
black
suspicions
and
civil
discord
parliament
had
not
sat
long
before
it
was
discovered
that
a
change
had
taken
place
in
its
temper
and
spirit
the
plague
and
the
fire
had
contributed
to
this
change
the
london
clergy
had
not
exhibited
great
devotion
during
the
former
affliction
many
of
the
incumbents
deserted
their
flocks
and
their
empty
pulpits
had
been
filled
by
zealots
who
preached
woe
unto
jerusalem
the
profligacy
of
the
court
and
the
general
decay
of
manners
when
added
to
the
severity
of
the
legislation
against
the
nonconformists
gave
the
ejected
clergy
opportunities
for
a
renewal
of
their
spiritual
ministrations
and
as
usual
their
labours
salute
aroused
political
dissatisfaction
some
of
the
more
outrageous
supporters
of
the
royal
prerogative
the
renegade
may
among
them
professed
to
see
in
the
fire
a
punishment
upon
the
spirit
of
freedom
for
which
the
city
had
once
been
famous
and
urged
the
king
not
to
suffer
it
to
be
rebuilt
again
to
be
a
bit
in
his
mouth
and
a
bridle
upon
his
neck
but
to
keep
it
all
open
and
that
his
troops
might
enter
whenever
he
thought
necessary
there
being
no
other
way
to
govern
that
rude
multitude
but
by
force
rabid
nonsense
of
this
kind
had
no
weight
with
the
king
who
never
showed
his
native
good
sense
more
conspicuously
than
in
the
pains
he
took
over
the
rebuilding
of
london
but
none
the
less
it
had
its
effect
in
getting
rid
once
and
for
ever
of
that
spirit
of
excessive
besotted
is
hallam
word
loyalty
which
had
characterised
the
restoration
the
king
of
course
wanted
money
nor
was
parliament
disposed
to
refuse
it
we
being
still
at
war
with
holland
but
to
the
horror
of
that
elderly
pedant
lord
clarendon
the
commons
passed
a
bill
appointing
a
commission
of
members
of
both
houses
to
inspect
i
am
now
quoting
marvell
and
examine
thoroughly
the
former
expense
of
the
of
the
of
the
militia
money
of
the
prize
goods
etc
in
an
earlier
letter
marvell
attributes
the
new
temper
of
parliament
not
to
any
want
of
ardour
to
supply
the
public
necessities
but
out
of
our
house
sense
also
of
the
burden
to
be
laid
upon
the
subject
clarendon
was
so
alarmed
that
he
advised
a
dissolution
charles
was
alarmed
too
knowing
well
that
both
carteret
the
treasurer
of
the
navy
and
lord
ashley
the
treasurer
of
the
prize
money
issued
out
many
sums
upon
the
king
warrant
for
which
no
accounts
could
be
produced
but
he
was
still
more
frightened
of
a
new
parliament
in
the
present
parliament
he
had
so
clarendon
admits
a
hundred
members
of
his
own
menial
servants
and
their
near
relations
the
bishops
were
also
against
a
dissolution
dreading
the
return
of
presbyterian
members
so
clarendon
advice
was
not
followed
and
the
king
very
reluctantly
consented
to
the
commission
about
which
pepys
has
so
much
to
say
it
did
not
get
appointed
at
once
but
when
it
did
pepys
rejoices
greatly
that
its
secretary
jessopp
was
an
old
fashioned
cromwell
man
in
other
words
both
honest
and
efficient
the
shrewd
secretary
of
the
navy
office
here
puts
his
finger
on
the
real
of
the
restoration
our
puritan
historians
write
rather
loosely
about
the
floodgates
of
dissipation
having
been
flung
open
by
that
event
as
if
it
had
wrought
a
sudden
change
in
human
nature
pepys
whose
frank
diary
begins
during
the
protectorate
underwent
no
such
change
he
was
just
the
same
sinner
under
cromwell
as
he
was
under
charles
sober
grave
divines
may
be
found
deploring
the
growing
profligacy
of
the
times
long
before
the
of
may
an
era
of
extravagance
was
evidently
to
be
expected
no
doubt
the
king
return
assisted
it
no
country
could
be
anything
but
the
worse
for
having
charles
the
second
as
its
most
religious
king
the
restoration
of
the
stuarts
was
the
best
excuse
for
a
glass
ever
offered
to
an
englishman
he
availed
himself
of
it
with
even
more
than
his
accustomed
freedom
but
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
king
debauchery
was
ever
approved
of
even
in
london
both
the
mercurial
pepys
and
the
grave
evelyn
alike
deplore
it
the
misfortune
clearly
attributable
to
the
king
return
was
the
substitution
of
a
corrupt
inefficient
and
unpatriotic
administration
for
the
servants
of
the
public
whom
cromwell
had
gathered
round
him
parliament
was
busy
with
new
taxes
in
november
marvell
writes
the
committee
has
prepared
these
votes
all
persons
shall
pay
one
shilling
per
poll
all
aliens
two
all
nonconformists
and
papists
two
all
servants
one
shilling
in
the
pound
of
their
wages
all
personal
estates
shall
pay
for
so
much
as
is
not
already
taxed
by
the
after
twenty
shillings
in
the
hundred
cattle
corn
and
household
furniture
shall
be
excepted
and
all
such
as
is
already
taxed
by
the
but
the
rest
to
be
liable
stringent
work
later
on
we
read
three
shillings
in
the
pound
for
all
offices
and
public
employments
except
military
lawyers
and
physicians
proportionate
to
their
practice
here
is
the
long
before
pitt
the
house
of
lords
trembling
on
the
verge
of
a
breach
of
privilege
altered
this
poll
bill
marvell
writes
in
january
we
have
not
advanced
much
this
week
the
alterations
of
the
lords
upon
the
poll
bill
have
kept
us
busy
we
have
disagreed
in
most
aliens
we
adhere
to
pay
double
nonconformists
we
agree
with
them
to
pay
double
to
to
allow
no
exemptions
from
patents
to
free
from
paying
we
adhere
and
we
also
rejected
a
long
clause
whereby
they
as
well
as
the
commoners
pretend
distinctly
to
give
to
the
king
and
we
send
up
our
reasons
the
lords
agreed
and
the
bill
passed
ireland
supplied
a
very
stormy
measure
i
am
afraid
marvell
was
on
the
wrong
side
but
owing
to
his
reserve
i
am
not
sure
an
irish
cattle
bill
was
a
measure
very
popular
in
the
house
of
commons
its
object
being
to
prevent
ireland
from
sending
over
live
beasts
to
be
fattened
killed
and
consumed
in
england
you
can
read
all
about
it
in
clarendon
vol
iii
pp
and
think
you
are
reading
about
canadian
cattle
the
breeders
in
a
majority
were
on
one
side
and
the
owners
of
on
the
other
the
breeders
said
the
irish
cattle
were
bred
in
ireland
for
nothing
and
transported
for
little
that
they
undersold
the
cattle
and
consequently
the
breed
of
cattle
in
the
kingdom
was
totally
given
over
and
rents
fell
other
members
contended
in
their
places
that
their
countries
had
no
land
bad
enough
to
breed
and
that
their
traffic
consisted
in
buying
lean
cattle
and
making
them
fat
and
upon
this
they
paid
their
rent
nobody
except
the
king
gave
a
thought
to
ireland
he
in
this
not
unworthy
of
his
great
tudor
predecessor
henry
the
eighth
declared
he
was
king
of
ireland
no
less
than
of
england
and
would
do
nothing
to
injure
one
portion
of
his
dominions
for
the
benefit
of
another
but
as
usual
he
gave
way
being
in
great
straits
for
money
the
house
of
lords
was
better
disposed
towards
ireland
than
the
house
of
commons
but
they
too
yielded
to
selfish
clamour
and
the
bill
which
had
excited
great
fury
became
law
and
proved
ineffective
owing
as
was
alleged
to
that
corruption
which
restrictions
on
trade
seem
to
have
the
trick
of
breeding
it
is
always
agreeable
to
be
reminded
that
however
large
a
part
of
our
history
is
composed
of
the
record
of
passion
greed
delusion
and
stupidity
yet
the
love
of
order
and
of
justice
in
matters
of
business
have
usually
been
the
predominant
factors
in
our
national
life
despite
priest
merchant
and
party
nowhere
is
this
better
illustrated
than
by
two
measures
to
which
marvell
refers
as
bills
for
the
prevention
of
lawsuits
between
landlord
and
tenant
and
for
the
rebuilding
of
london
both
these
bills
became
law
in
february
within
five
months
of
the
great
catastrophe
that
was
their
occasion
two
more
sensible
courageous
measures
were
never
piloted
through
both
houses
king
lords
and
commons
all
put
their
heads
together
to
face
a
great
emergency
and
to
provide
an
immediate
remedy
the
bill
to
prevent
lawsuits
is
best
appreciated
if
we
read
its
preamble
whereas
the
greatest
part
of
the
houses
in
the
city
of
london
having
been
burnt
by
the
dreadful
and
dismal
fire
which
happened
in
september
last
many
of
the
tenants
and
late
occupiers
are
liable
unto
suits
and
actions
to
compel
them
to
repair
and
to
rebuild
the
same
and
to
pay
their
rents
as
if
the
same
had
not
been
burnt
and
are
not
relievable
therefor
in
any
ordinary
course
of
law
and
great
differences
are
likely
to
arise
concerning
the
repairs
and
rebuilding
the
said
houses
and
payment
of
rents
which
if
they
should
not
be
determined
with
speed
and
without
charge
would
much
obstruct
the
rebuilding
of
the
city
and
for
that
it
is
just
that
everyone
concerned
should
bear
a
proportionate
share
of
this
loss
according
to
their
several
interests
wherein
in
respect
of
the
multitude
of
cases
varying
in
their
circumstances
no
certain
general
rule
can
be
prescribed
after
this
recital
it
was
enacted
that
the
judges
of
the
king
bench
and
common
pleas
and
the
barons
of
the
exchequer
or
any
three
or
more
of
them
should
form
a
court
of
record
to
hear
and
determine
every
possible
dispute
or
difference
arising
out
of
the
great
fire
whether
relating
to
liability
to
repair
and
rebuild
or
to
pay
rent
or
for
arrears
of
rent
other
than
arrears
which
had
accrued
due
before
the
of
september
or
otherwise
howsoever
the
proceedings
were
to
be
by
summary
process
forma
et
figura
and
without
court
fees
the
judges
were
to
be
bound
by
no
rules
either
of
law
or
equity
and
might
call
for
what
evidence
they
chose
including
that
of
the
interested
parties
and
try
the
case
as
it
best
could
be
tried
their
orders
were
to
be
final
and
not
save
in
a
single
excepted
case
subject
to
any
appeal
all
persons
in
remainder
and
reversion
were
to
be
bound
by
these
orders
although
infants
married
women
idiots
beyond
seas
or
under
any
other
disability
a
special
power
was
given
to
order
the
surrender
of
existing
leases
and
to
grant
new
ones
for
terms
not
exceeding
forty
years
the
judges
gave
their
services
for
nothing
and
for
once
released
from
all
their
own
trammels
set
to
work
to
do
substantial
justice
between
landlord
and
tenant
personalty
and
realty
the
life
interest
and
the
remainder
covenantor
and
covenantee
after
a
fashion
which
excited
the
admiration
and
won
the
confidence
of
the
whole
city
the
ordinary
suitor
still
left
exposed
to
the
pitfalls
of
the
special
pleader
the
risks
owing
to
the
exclusion
of
evidence
of
a
and
the
costly
cumbersomeness
of
the
court
of
chancery
must
often
have
wished
that
the
of
his
litigation
had
perished
in
the
flames
of
the
great
fire
this
court
sat
in
clifford
inn
and
was
usually
presided
over
by
sir
matthew
hale
whose
skill
both
as
an
arithmetician
and
an
architect
completed
his
fitness
for
so
responsible
a
position
within
a
year
the
work
was
done
the
act
for
rebuilding
the
city
is
an
elaborate
measure
of
more
than
forty
clauses
and
aimed
at
securing
the
regularity
safety
conveniency
and
beauty
of
the
new
london
that
was
to
be
the
buildings
were
classified
according
to
their
position
and
character
and
had
to
maintain
a
prescribed
level
of
quality
the
materials
to
be
employed
were
named
new
streets
were
to
be
of
certain
widths
and
so
on
this
is
the
act
that
contains
the
first
betterment
clause
and
forasmuch
as
the
houses
now
remaining
and
to
be
rebuilt
will
receive
more
or
less
advantage
in
the
value
of
the
rents
by
the
liberty
of
air
and
free
recourse
for
trade
it
was
enacted
that
a
jury
might
be
sworn
to
assess
upon
the
owners
and
others
interested
of
and
in
the
said
houses
such
sum
or
sums
of
money
with
respect
of
their
several
interests
in
consideration
of
such
improvement
and
melioration
as
in
reason
and
good
conscience
they
shall
think
fit
it
takes
nothing
short
of
a
catastrophe
to
suspend
in
england
even
for
a
few
months
those
rules
of
evidence
that
often
make
justice
impossible
and
those
rights
of
landlords
which
for
centuries
have
appropriated
public
expenditure
to
private
gain
the
moneys
required
to
pay
for
the
land
taken
under
the
act
to
widen
streets
and
to
accomplish
the
other
authorised
works
were
raised
as
marvell
informs
his
constituents
by
a
tax
of
twelve
pence
on
every
chaldron
of
coal
coming
as
far
as
gravesend
few
taxes
have
had
so
useful
and
so
harmless
a
life
all
this
time
the
dutch
war
was
going
on
but
the
heart
was
out
of
it
nothing
in
england
is
so
popular
as
war
except
the
peace
that
comes
after
it
the
king
now
wanted
peace
and
the
merchants
on
had
glutted
their
ire
in
february
the
king
told
the
houses
of
parliament
that
all
sober
men
would
be
glad
to
see
peace
unluckily
it
seems
to
have
been
assumed
that
we
could
have
peace
whenever
we
wanted
it
and
the
fatal
error
was
committed
of
at
once
laying
up
the
ships
it
thus
came
about
that
whilst
still
at
war
england
had
no
fleet
to
put
to
sea
it
did
not
at
first
seem
likely
that
the
overtures
for
peace
would
present
much
difficulty
when
suddenly
arose
the
question
of
poleroone
it
is
amazing
how
few
englishmen
have
ever
heard
of
poleroone
or
even
of
the
banda
islands
of
which
group
it
is
one
indeed
a
more
insignificant
speck
in
the
ocean
it
would
be
hard
to
find
to
discover
it
on
an
atlas
is
no
easy
task
yet
but
for
poleroone
the
dutch
would
never
have
taken
sheerness
or
broken
the
chain
at
gillingham
or
carried
away
with
them
to
the
texel
the
proud
vessel
that
had
brought
back
charles
the
second
to
an
excited
population
poleroone
is
a
small
island
in
the
indian
archipelago
not
far
from
the
eastern
extremity
of
new
guinea
king
james
the
first
imagined
he
had
some
right
to
it
and
at
any
rate
oliver
cromwell
when
he
made
peace
with
the
dutch
made
a
great
point
of
poleroone
have
it
he
would
for
the
east
india
company
the
dutch
objected
but
gave
way
and
by
an
article
in
the
treaty
with
oliver
bound
themselves
to
give
up
poleroone
to
the
company
all
in
fact
that
they
did
do
was
to
cut
down
the
nutmeg
trees
and
so
make
the
island
good
for
nothing
for
many
a
long
year
physical
possession
was
never
taken
for
some
unaccountable
reason
charles
who
had
sold
oliver
dunkirk
to
the
french
for
half
a
million
of
money
stuck
out
for
poleroone
what
cromwell
had
taken
he
was
not
going
to
give
up
on
the
other
hand
neither
would
the
dutch
give
up
poleroone
this
dispute
about
a
barren
island
delayed
the
settlement
of
the
peace
preliminaries
but
eventually
the
british
plenipotentiaries
did
get
out
to
breda
in
may
our
sanguine
king
expected
an
immediate
cessation
of
hostilities
and
that
his
unpreparedness
would
thus
be
huddled
up
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
beginning
of
june
de
ruyter
led
out
his
fleet
and
with
a
fair
wind
behind
him
stood
for
the
thames
all
is
fair
in
war
england
was
caught
napping
the
doleful
history
reads
like
that
of
a
sudden
piratical
onslaught
and
reveals
the
fatal
inefficiency
of
the
administration
sheerness
was
practically
defenceless
there
were
a
company
or
two
of
very
good
soldiers
there
under
excellent
officers
but
the
fortifications
were
so
weak
and
unfinished
and
all
other
provisions
so
entirely
wanting
that
the
dutch
fleet
no
sooner
approached
within
a
distance
but
with
their
cannon
they
beat
all
the
works
flat
and
drove
all
the
men
from
the
ground
which
as
soon
as
they
had
done
with
their
boats
they
landed
men
and
seemed
resolved
to
fortify
and
keep
it
capture
of
sheerness
by
the
dutch
no
need
of
a
halfpenny
press
to
spread
this
news
through
a
london
still
in
ruins
what
made
matters
worse
the
sailors
were
more
than
being
paid
with
tickets
not
readily
convertible
into
cash
many
of
them
actually
deserted
to
the
dutch
fleet
which
made
its
leisurely
way
upstream
passing
upnor
castle
which
had
guns
but
no
ammunition
till
it
was
almost
within
reach
of
chatham
where
lay
the
royal
navy
general
monk
who
was
the
handy
man
of
the
period
and
whose
authority
was
always
invoked
when
the
king
he
had
restored
was
in
greater
trouble
than
usual
had
hastily
collected
what
troops
he
could
muster
and
marched
to
protect
chatham
but
what
were
wanted
were
ships
not
troops
the
dutch
had
no
mind
to
land
and
after
firing
three
warships
the
the
and
the
and
capturing
the
they
thought
they
had
done
enough
and
made
use
of
the
ebb
to
carry
them
back
again
these
events
occupied
the
tenth
to
the
fifteenth
of
june
and
for
the
impression
they
produced
on
mind
we
are
not
dependent
upon
his
restrained
letters
to
his
constituents
but
can
turn
to
his
longest
rhymed
satire
which
is
believed
to
have
been
first
printed
anonymously
of
course
as
a
broadsheet
in
august
this
poem
is
called
last
instructions
to
a
painter
about
the
dutch
the
title
was
derived
from
waller
panegyric
poem
on
the
occasion
of
the
duke
of
york
victory
over
the
dutch
on
the
of
june
when
opdam
the
dutch
admiral
was
blown
up
with
his
ship
sir
john
denham
a
brother
satirist
of
marvell
and
with
as
good
an
excuse
for
hating
the
duke
of
york
as
this
world
affords
had
seized
upon
the
same
idea
and
published
four
satirical
poems
on
these
same
dutch
wars
entitled
to
a
see
on
affairs
of
vol
marvell
satire
which
runs
to
lines
is
essentially
a
house
of
commons
poem
and
could
only
have
been
written
by
a
member
it
is
intensely
lobbyish
and
occasional
to
understand
its
allusions
to
appreciate
its
capacity
to
the
full
is
now
impossible
still
the
reader
of
clarendon
pepys
and
to
name
only
popular
books
will
have
no
difficulty
in
entering
into
the
spirit
of
the
performance
as
a
poem
it
is
rough
in
execution
careless
breathless
a
rugged
style
was
then
in
vogue
even
milton
could
write
his
lines
to
the
cambridge
carrier
somewhat
in
this
manner
marvell
has
nothing
of
the
magnificence
of
dryden
or
of
the
finished
malice
of
pope
he
plays
the
part
and
it
is
sincerely
played
of
the
old
honest
member
of
parliament
who
loves
his
country
and
hates
rogues
and
speaks
right
out
calling
spades
spades
and
the
king
women
what
they
ought
to
be
called
he
is
conversational
and
therefore
coarse
the
whole
history
of
the
events
that
resulted
in
the
national
disgrace
is
told
the
close
cabal
marked
how
the
navy
eats
and
thought
all
lost
that
goes
not
to
the
cheats
so
therefore
secretly
for
peace
decrees
yet
for
a
war
the
parliament
would
squeeze
and
fix
to
the
revenue
such
a
sum
should
goodricke
silence
and
make

when
all
the

graced

and
father
neptune
promised
to
resign
his
empire
old
to
their
immortal
line
now
with
vain
grief
their
vainer
hopes
they
rue
themselves
dishonoured
and
the

untrue
and
to
each
other
helpless

moan
as
the

groan
but
most
they
for

and
were

to

to
relish
discontent
some

must
be
accused
by

all
our
miscarriages
on

his

beget

this
outburst
can
hardly
fail
to
remind
the
reader
of
a
famous
outburst
of
micawber
on
the
subject
of
uriah
heep
the
satire
concludes
with
the
picture
of
the
king
in
the
dead
shades
of
night
alone
in
his
room
startled
by
loud
noises
of
cannons
trumpets
and
drums
and
then
visited
by
the
ghost
of
his
father
and
ghastly
charles
turning
his
collar
low
the
purple
thread
about
his
neck
does
show
the
pensive
king
resolves
on
clarendon
disgrace
and
on
rising
next
morning
seeks
out
lady
castlemaine
bennet
and
coventry
who
give
him
the
same
advice
he
knows
them
all
three
to
be
false
to
one
another
and
to
him
but
is
for
the
moment
content
to
do
what
they
wish
i
have
omitted
in
this
review
of
a
long
poem
the
earlier
lines
which
deal
with
the
composition
of
the
house
of

all
its
parties
are
described
one
after

old
courtiers

lieutenant
mild
bronkard
love
squire
through
all
the
field
arrayed
no
troop
was
better
clad
nor
so
well
paid
clarendon
had
his
friends
soon
sorely
to
be
needed
and
after
them
next
to
the
lawyers
sordid
band
appear
finch
in
the
front
and
thurland
in
the
rear
some
members
are
mentioned
by
their
names
and
habits
the
speaker
sir
edward
turner
is
somewhat
unkindly
described
honest
men
are
usually
to
be
found
everywhere
and
they
existed
even
in
charles
the
second
pensionary
parliament
nor
could
all
these
the
field
have
long
maintained
but
for
the
unknown
reserve
that
still
remained
a
gross
of
english
gentry
nobly
born
of
clear
estates
and
to
no
faction
sworn
dear
lovers
of
their
king
and
death
to
meet
for

glorious
thing

sweet
to
speak
not
forward
but
in
action
brave
in

generous
but
in

grave
candidly
credulous
for
once
nay
twice
but
sure
the
devil
can
not
cheat
them
thrice
no
member
of

library
is
complete
without
marvell

charles

was
not
the
man

or
to
mourn
over
lost
prestige

ruyter
had
gone
after
suffering
repulses
at
portsmouth

and
torbay
peace
was
concluded
at

on
the
of

we
gave
up

we
gained
a
more
famous
place

amsterdam
rechristened

in
honour
of

all
prisoners
were
to
be
liberated
and
the
dutch
despite
sheerness
and
the
agreed
to
lower
their

to

british
ships
of

the
fall
long
pending
of

immediately
followed
the
peace
men
tempers
were
furious
or
sullen
hyde
had
no
more
bitter
no
more
cruel
enemy
than
marvell
why
this
was
has
not
been
discovered
but
there
was
nothing
too
bad
for
marvell
not
to
believe
of
any
member
of
clarendon
household
all
the
scandals
and
they
were
many
and
horrible
relating
to
clarendon
and
his
daughter
the
duchess
of
york
find
a
place
in
marvell
satires
and
epigrams
to
us
lord
clarendon
is
a
grave
and
thoughtful
figure
the
of
history
of
the
rebellion
and
civil
wars
in
that
famous
large
book
loftily
planned
finely
executed
full
of
life
and
character
and
the
philosophy
of
human
existence
and
of
his
own
a
production
which
though
it
must
like
burnet
be
read
with
caution
unveils
to
the
reader
a
portion
of
that
past
which
usually
is
as
deeply
shrouded
from
us
as
the
future
if
at
times
we
are
reminded
in
reading
clarendon
of
the
old
steward
in
hogarth
plate
who
lifts
up
his
hands
in
horror
over
the
extravagance
of
his
master
if
his
pedantry
often
irritates
and
his
love
of
place
displeases
we
recognise
these
but
as
the
shades
of
the
character
of
a
distinguished
and
accomplished
public
servant
but
to
marvell
clarendon
was
rapacious
ambitious
and
corrupt
a
man
who
had
sold
oliver
dunkirk
to
the
french
and
shared
the
price
who
had
selected
for
the
king
consort
a
barren
woman
so
that
his
own
damaged
daughter
might
at
least
chance
to
become
queen
of
england
who
hated
parliaments
and
hankered
after
a
standing
army
who
took
money
for
patents
who
sold
public
offices
who
was
bribed
by
the
dutch
about
the
terms
of
peace
who
swindled
the
ruined
cavaliers
of
the
funds
subscribed
for
their
benefit
and
had
by
these
methods
heaped
together
great
wealth
which
he
ostentatiously
displayed
even
darker
crimes
than
these
are
hinted
at
that
marvell
was
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
clarendon
character
now
seems
certain
clarendon
did
not
get
a
penny
of
the
dunkirk
money
the
case
made
against
him
by
the
house
of
commons
in
their
articles
of
impeachment
was
felt
even
at
the
time
to
be
flimsy
and
incapable
of
proof
and
in
the
many
records
that
have
come
to
light
since
clarendon
day
nothing
has
been
discovered
to
give
them
support
and
yet
marvell
was
a
singularly
member
of
parliament
a
shrewd
man
of
affairs
who
knew
lord
clarendon
in
the
way
we
know
men
we
have
to
see
on
business
matters
whose
speeches
we
can
listen
to
and
whose
conduct
we
discuss
and
criticise
gently
scan
your
is
a
precept
marvell
never
took
to
heart
nor
is
the
house
of
commons
a
place
where
it
is
either
preached
or
practised
when
clarendon
was
well
nigh
at
the
height
of
his
great
unpopularity
he
built
himself
a
fine
big
house
on
a
site
given
him
by
the
king
where
now
is
albemarle
street
where
did
he
get
the
money
from
he
employed
in
building
it
the
stones
of
paul
cathedral
true
he
bought
the
stones
from
the
dean
and
chapter
but
if
the
man
you
hate
builds
a
great
house
out
of
the
ruins
of
a
church
is
it
likely
that
so
trivial
a
fact
as
a
cash
payment
for
the
materials
is
going
to
be
mentioned
splendid
furniture
and
noble
pictures
were
to
be
seen
going
into
the
new
palace
the
gifts
so
it
was
alleged
of
foreign
ambassadors
what
was
the
consideration
for
these
donations

clarendon
fall
was

he
knew
the
house
of
stuart
too
well
to
place
any
reliance
upon
the
king
evelyn
visited
him
on
the
of
august
after
the
seals
had
been
taken
away
from
him
and
found
him
in
his
very
sad
his
enemies
were
numerous
and
powerful
both
in
the
house
of
commons
and
at
court
where
all
the
buffoons
and
ladies
of
pleasure
hated
him
because
so
evelyn
says
he
thwarted
some
of
them
and
stood
in
their
way
in
november
evelyn
called
again
and
found
the
late
in
the
garden
of
his
palace
sitting
in
his
gout
and
watching
the
new
gates
setting
up
towards
the
north
and
the
fields
he
looked
and
spoke
very
disconsolately
after
some
while
deploring
his
condition
to
me
i
took
my
leave
next
morning
i
heard
he
was
gone
the
news
was
true
on
saturday
the
of
november
he
drove
to
erith
and
after
a
terrible
tossing
on
the
nobly
impartial
channel
the
weary
man
reached
calais
and
died
seven
years
later
in
rouen
having
well
employed
his
leisure
in
completing
his
history
his
palace
was
sold
for
half
what
it
cost
to
the
inevitable
monk
duke
of
albemarle
on
the
of
december
marvell
writes
that
the
house
having
heard
that
lord
clarendon
had
withdrawn
forthwith
ordered
an
address
to
his
majesty
that
care
might
be
taken
for
securing
all
the
sea
ports
lest
he
should
pass
there
marvell
adds
grimly
i
suppose
he
will
not
trouble
you
at
hull
the
king
took
good
care
that
his
late
should
escape
an
act
of
perpetual
banishment
was
at
once
passed
receiving
the
royal
assent
on
the
of
december
marvell
was
kept
very
busy
during
the
early
months
of
inquiring
as
our
english
fashion
is
into
the
miscarriages
of
the
late
war
the
house
more
than
once
sat
from
nine
in
the
morning
till
eight
at
night
finding
out
all
it
could
what
money
arising
by
the
poll
money
had
been
applied
to
the
use
of
the
war
this
was
an
awkward
inquiry
the
house
voted
that
the
not
prosecuting
the
first
victory
of
june
was
a
miscarriage
and
one
of
the
greatest
a
snub
to
the
duke
of
york
the
not
furnishing
the
medway
with
a
sufficient
guard
of
ships
though
the
king
had
then
men
in
his
pay
was
another
great
miscarriage
the
paying
of
the
fleet
with
tickets
without
money
was
a
third
great
miscarriage

this
time

should
be
so
much
more
at
liberty
to
show
how
voluntary
and
affectionate
he
was
toward
your
corporation
i
returned
the
civilest
words
i
could
coin
on
for
the
present
and
rendered
him
your
humble
thanks
for
his
continued
patronage
of
you
and
told
him
that
you
had
further
sent
him
up
a
small
tribute
of
your
hull
liquor
he
thanked
you
again
for
all
these
things
which
you
might
he
said
have
spared
and
added
that
if
the
greatest
of
your
military
officers
should
demean
himself
ill
towards
you
he
would
take
a
course
with
him
a
drawing
near
his
end
wise
was
removed
from
the
hull
garrison
the
affronted
corporation
was
not
satisfied
and
marvell
had
to
argue
the
point
and
i
hope
sir
you
will
incline
the
bench
to
consider
whether
i
am
able
or
whether
it
be
fit
for
me
to
urge
it
beyond
that
point
yet
it
is
not
all
his
wise
parliament
men
and
relations
that
have
wrought
me
in
the
least
but
what
i
simply
conceive
as
the
state
of
things
now
to
be
possible
and
satisfactory
what
would
you
have
more
of
a
soldier
than
to
run
away
and
have
him
cashiered
as
to
any
command
in
your
garrison
the
first
he
hath
done
and
the
second
he
must
submit
to
and
i
assure
you
whatsoever
he
was
among
you
he
is
here
a
kind
of
decrepit
young
gentleman
and
terribly
the
letter
concludes
thus
for
i
assure
you
they
use
all
the
civility
imaginable
to
you
and
as
we
sat
there
drinking
a
cup
of
sack
with
the
general
colonel
legge
chancing
to
be
present
there
were
twenty
good
things
said
on
all
hands
tending
to
the
good
fame
reputation
and
advantage
of
the
town
an
occasion
that
i
was
heartily
glad
of
corporations
may
not
have
souls
to
save
and
bodies
to
kill
but
evidently
they
have
vanities
to
tickle
in
november
the
house
is
still
busy
over
the
accounts
sir
george
carteret
was
treasurer
of
the
navy
marvell
refers
to
him
in
last
instructions
to
a
as
carteret
the
rich
did
the
accountants
guide
and
in
ill
english
all
the
world
defied
the
following
letter
of
marvell
gives
an
excellent
account
of
house
of
commons
business
both
how
it
is
conducted
and
how
often
it
gets
accidentally
interrupted
by
other
business
unexpectedly
cropping
up
gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
returning
after
our
adjournment
to
sit
upon
wednesday
the
house
having
heard
what
sir
cartaret
could
say
for
himselfe
and
he
then
commended
to
withdraw
after
a
considerable
debate
put
it
to
the
question
whether
he
were
guilty
of
misdemeanour
upon
the
commissioners
first
observation
the
words
of
which
were
that
all
monyes
received
by
him
out
of
his
exchequer
are
by
the
privy
seales
assigned
for
particular
services
but
no
such
thing
observed
or
specified
in
his
payments
whereby
he
hath
assumed
to
himselfe
a
liberty
to
make
use
of
the
treasure
for
other
uses
then
is
directed
the
house
dividing
upon
the
question
the
ayes
went
out
and
wondered
why
they
were
kept
out
so
extraordinary
a
time
the
ayes
proved
and
the
noes
and
the
reason
of
the
long
stay
then
appeared
the
tellers
for
the
ayes
chanced
to
be
very
ill
reckoners
so
that
they
were
forced
to
tell
severall
times
over
in
the
house
and
when
at
last
the
tellers
for
the
ayes
would
have
agreed
the
noes
to
be
the
noes
would
needs
say
that
they
were
whereupon
those
for
the
ayes
would
tell
once
more
and
then
found
the
noes
to
be
indeed
but
and
the
ayes
then
coming
in
proved
to
be
whereas
if
the
noes
had
been
content
with
the
first
error
of
the
tellers
sir
george
had
been
quit
upon
that
observation
this
i
have
told
you
so
minutely
because
it
is
the
second
fatall
and
ominous
accident
that
hath
fain
out
in
the
divisions
about
sir
cartaret
thursday
was
ordered
for
the
second
observation
the
words
of
which
are
two
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
seven
hundred
thirty
and
one
thousand
pounds
thirteen
shillings
and
ninepence
claimed
as
payd
and
deposited
for
security
of
interest
and
yet
no
distinct
specification
of
time
appeares
either
on
his
receits
or
payments
whereby
no
judgment
can
be
made
how
interest
accrues
so
that
we
can
not
yet
allow
the
same
but
this
day
was
diverted
and
wholy
taken
up
by
a
speciall
report
orderd
by
the
committee
for
the
bill
of
conventicles
that
the
house
be
informed
of
severall
conventicles
in
westminster
which
might
be
of
dangerous
consequences
from
hence
arose
much
discourse
also
of
a
report
that
ludlow
was
in
england
that
flock
about
the
town
and
there
were
meetings
said
to
be
where
they
talkt
of
new
modells
of
government
so
that
the
house
ordered
a
committee
to
receive
informations
both
concerning
conventicles
and
these
other
dangerous
meetings
and
then
entered
a
resolution
upon
their
books
without
putting
it
to
the
question
that
this
house
will
adhere
to
his
majesty
and
the
government
of
church
and
state
as
now
established
against
all
its
enemyes
friday
having
bin
appointed
as
i
told
you
in
my
former
letter
for
the
house
to
sit
in
a
grand
committee
upon
the
motion
for
the
king
supply
was
spent
wholy
in
debate
whether
they
should
do
so
or
no
and
concluded
at
last
in
a
consent
that
the
sitting
in
a
grand
committee
upon
the
motion
for
the
supply
should
be
put
of
till
friday
next
and
so
it
was
ordered
the
reason
of
which
kind
of
proceeding
lest
you
should
thinke
to
arise
from
an
indisposition
of
the
house
i
shall
tell
you
as
they
appeare
to
me
to
have
been
the
expectation
of
what
bill
will
come
from
the
lords
in
stead
of
that
of
ours
which
they
threw
out
and
a
desire
to
redresse
and
see
thoroughly
into
the
miscarriages
of
mony
before
any
more
should
be
granted
the
house
hath
bin
upon
the
second
observation
and
after
a
debate
till
foure
have
voted
him
guilty
also
of
misdemeanor
in
that
particular
the
commissioners
are
ordered
to
attend
the
house
again
on
munday
which
is
done
constantly
for
the
illustration
of
any
matter
in
their
report
wherein
the
house
is
not
cleare
and
to
say
the
truth
the
house
receives
great
satisfaction
from
them
and
shows
them
extraordinary
respect
these
are
the
things
of
principall
notice
since
my
last
carteret
eventually
was
censured
and
suspended
and
dismissed
the
sudden
incursion
of
religion
during
a
financial
debate
is
highly
characteristic
of
the
house
of
commons
whilst
queen
elizabeth
and
her
advisers
did
succeed
in
making
some
sort
of
a
settlement
of
religion
having
regard
to
the
questions
of
her
time
the
restoration
bishops
an
inferior
set
of
men
wholly
failed
the
repressive
legislation
that
followed
upon
the
act
of
uniformity
succeeded
in
establishing
and
endowing
with
voluntary
contributions
what
is
sometimes
called
absurdly
enough
political
dissent
on
points
not
of
doctrine
but
of
ceremony
and
of
church
government
one
half
of
the
community
were
by
oaths
and
declarations
and
by
employing
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
as
a
picklock
to
a
place
drawn
out
of
the
service
of
the
state
excluded
from
parliament
and
from
all
corporate
bodies
from
and
universities
english
dissent
learned
to
live
its
own
life
remote
from
the
army
the
navy
and
the
civil
service
quite
outside
of
what
perhaps
may
be
fairly
called
the
main
currents
of
the
national
life
nonconformists
venerated
their
own
divines
were
reared
in
their
own
academies
and
colleges
read
their
own
books
went
when
the
modified
law
permitted
it
to
their
own
conventicles
in
back
streets
and
made
it
their
boast
that
they
had
never
entered
their
parish
churches
for
the
upkeep
of
which
they
were
compelled
to
subscribe
save
for
the
purpose
of
being
married
the
nation
suffered
by
reason
of
this
complete
severance
trade
excepted
there
was
no
community
of
interest
between
church
and
dissent
sobriety
gravity
a
decent
way
of
life
the
sense
of
religious
obligation
even
when
united
with
the
habit
of
prayer
and
a
hereditary
disrespect
for
bishops
aprons
are
national
assets
as
the
expression
now
goes
which
can
not
be
disregarded
with
impunity
the
conventicle
act
marvell
refers
to
was
a
stringent
measure
imposing
pecuniary
fines
upon
any
persons
of
sixteen
years
of
age
or
upwards
who
under
pretence
of
religion
should
be
present
at
any
meeting
of
more
than
five
persons
or
more
than
those
of
the
household
in
other
manner
than
allowed
by
the
liturgy
and
practice
of
the
church
of
england
heavier
fines
were
imposed
upon
the
preachers
the
poet
waller
who
was
nursed
in
parliaments
having
been
first
returned
from
amersham
in
made
a
very
sensible
remark
on
the
second
reading
let
them
alone
and
they
will
preach
against
each
other
by
this
bill
they
will
incorporate
as
being
all
under
one
calamity
but
by
to
the
bill
was
read
though
it
did
not
become
law
until
the
following
session
an
indignant
member
of
parliament
once
told
cromwell
that
he
would
take
the
sense
of
the
house
against
some
proposal
very
well
said
cromwell
you
shall
take
the
of
the
house
and
i
will
take
the
and
we
will
see
who
tells
the
most
votes
in
february
the
king
opened
a
new
session
and
in
march
marvell
wrote
a
private
letter
to
a
relative
at
bordeaux
in
which
he
lends
his
mind
out
after
a
fashion
forbidden
him
in
his
correspondence
with
his
constituents
dear
cousin
you
know
that
we
having
voted
the
king
before
christmas
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
no
more
and
enquiring
severely
into
ill
management
and
being
ready
to
adjourn
ourselves
till
february
his
majesty
fortified
by
some
undertakers
of
the
meanest
of
our
house
threw
up
all
as
nothing
and
prorogued
us
from
the
first
of
december
till
the
fourteenth
of
february
all
that
interval
there
was
great
and
numerous
caballing
among
the
courtiers
the
king
also
all
the
while
examined
at
council
the
reports
from
the
commissioners
of
accounts
where
they
were
continually
discountenanced
and
treated
rather
as
offenders
than
judges
in
this
posture
we
met
and
the
king
being
exceedingly
necessitous
for
money
spoke
to
us
minaci
et
and
told
us
the
inconveniences
which
would
fall
on
the
nation
by
want
of
a
supply
should
not
ly
at
his
door
that
we
must
not
revive
any
discord
betwixt
the
lords
and
us
that
he
himself
had
examined
the
accounts
and
found
every
penny
to
have
been
employed
in
the
war
and
he
recommended
the
scotch
union
the
garroway
party
appeared
with
the
usual
vigour
but
the
country
gentlemen
appeared
not
in
their
true
number
the
first
day
so
for
want
of
seven
voices
the
first
blow
was
against
them
when
we
began
to
talk
of
the
lords
the
king
sent
for
us
alone
and
recommended
a
rasure
of
all
proceedings
the
same
thing
you
know
that
we
proposed
at
first
we
presently
ordered
it
and
went
to
tell
him
so
the
same
day
and
to
thank
him
at
coming
down
a
pretty
ridiculous
thing
sir
thomas
clifford
carryed
speaker
and
mace
and
all
members
there
into
the
king
cellar
to
drink
his
health
the
king
sent
to
the
lords
more
peremptoryly
and
they
with
much
grumbling
agreed
to
the
rasure
when
the
commissioners
of
accounts
came
before
us
sometimes
we
heard
them
but
all
falls
to
dirt
the
terrible
bill
against
conventicles
is
sent
up
to
the
lords
and
we
and
the
lords
as
to
the
scotch
busyness
have
desired
the
king
to
name
english
commissioners
to
treat
but
nothing
they
do
to
be
valid
but
on
a
report
to
parliament
and
an
act
to
confirm
we
are
now
as
we
think
within
a
week
of
rising
they
are
making
mighty
alterations
in
the
conventicle
bill
which
as
we
sent
up
is
the
quintessence
of
arbitrary
malice
and
sit
whole
days
and
yet
proceed
but
by
inches
and
will
at
the
end
probably
affix
a
scotch
clause
of
the
king
power
in
externals
so
the
fate
of
the
bill
is
uncertain
but
must
probably
pass
being
the
price
of
money
the
king
told
some
eminent
citizens
who
applyed
to
him
against
it
that
they
must
address
themselves
to
the
houses
that
he
must
not
disoblige
his
friends
and
if
it
had
been
in
the
power
of
their
friends
he
had
gone
without
money
there
is
a
bill
in
the
lords
to
encourage
people
to
buy
all
the
king
rents
so
he
is
resolved
once
more
to
have
money
enough
in
his
pocket
and
live
on
the
common
for
the
future
the
great
bill
begun
in
the
lords
and
which
makes
more
ado
than
ever
any
act
in
this
parliament
did
is
for
enabling
lord
ros
long
since
divorced
in
the
spiritual
court
and
his
children
declared
illegitimate
by
act
of
parliament
to
marry
again
anglesey
and
ashly
who
study
and
know
their
interests
as
well
as
any
gentlemen
at
court
and
whose
sons
have
marryed
two
sisters
of
ros
inheritrixes
if
he
has
no
issue
yet
they
also
drive
on
the
bill
with
the
greatest
vigour
the
king
is
for
the
bill
the
duke
of
york
and
all
the
papist
lords
and
all
the
bishops
except
cosins
reynolds
and
wilkins
are
against
it
they
sat
all
thursday
last
without
once
rising
till
almost
ten
at
night
in
most
solemn
and
memorable
debate
whether
it
should
be
read
the
second
time
or
thrown
out
at
last
at
the
question
there
were
persons
and
six
proxys
against
it
and
persons
and
fifteen
proxys
for
it
if
it
had
not
gone
for
it
the
lord
arlington
had
a
power
in
his
pocket
from
the
king
to
have
nulled
the
proxys
if
it
had
been
to
the
purpose
it
was
read
the
second
time
yesterday
and
on
a
long
debate
whether
it
should
be
committed
it
went
for
the
bill
by
twelve
odds
in
persons
and
proxys
the
duke
of
york
the
bishops
and
the
rest
of
the
party
have
entered
their
protests
on
the
first
day
debate
against
it
is
not
this
fine
work
this
bill
must
come
down
to
us
it
is
my
opinion
that
lauderdale
at
one
ear
talks
to
the
king
of
monmouth
and
buckingham
at
the
other
of
a
new
queen
it
is
also
my
opinion
that
the
king
was
never
since
his
coming
in
nay
all
things
considered
no
king
since
the
conquest
so
absolutely
powerful
at
home
as
he
is
at
the
present
nor
any
parliament
or
places
so
certainly
and
constantly
supplyed
with
men
of
the
same
temper
in
such
a
conjuncture
dear
will
what
probability
is
there
of
my
doing
any
thing
to
the
purpose
the
king
would
needs
take
the
duke
of
albemarle
out
of
his
son
hand
to
bury
him
at
his
own
charges
it
is
almost
three
months
and
he
yet
lys
in
the
dark
unburyed
and
no
talk
of
him
he
left
twelve
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
near
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
money
his
wife
dyed
some
twenty
days
after
him
she
layed
in
state
and
was
buryed
at
her
son
expence
in
queen
elizabeth
chapel
and
now
disce
puer
virtutem
ex
me
verumque
laborem
fortunam
ex
aliis
this
remarkable
letter
lets
us
into
many
secrets
the
conventicle
bill
is
the
price
of
money
the
king
interest
in
the
roos
divorce
case
was
believed
to
be
due
to
his
own
desire
to
be
quit
of
a
barren
and
deserted
wife
our
most
religious
king
had
nineteen
bastards
but
no
lawful
issue
it
may
seem
strange
that
so
high
a
churchman
as
bishop
cosin
should
have
taken
the
view
he
did
but
cosin
had
a
strong
dash
of
the
layman
in
his
constitution
and
was
always
an
advocate
of
divorce
with
permission
to
in
cases
of
adultery
a
further
and
amending
bill
for
rebuilding
the
city
was
before
the
house
one
of
clauses
the
longest
bill
perhaps
that
ever
past

the
roos
divorce
bill

so
exciting
in

they
had

time

much
desired
by

regarded
with

by

fell
flat
though

were

passed

tagged
on

letter

of

of

dearest
will
i
wrote
to
you
two
letters
and
payd
for
them
from
the
posthouse
here
at
westminster
to
which
i
have
had
no
answer
perhaps
they
miscarryed
i
sent
on
an
answer
to
the
only
letter
i
received
from
bourdeaux
and
having
put
it
into
nelthorp
hand
i
doubt
not
but
it
came
to
your
to
proceed
the
same
day
march
letter
my
letter
bore
date
there
was
an
extraordinary
thing
done
the
king
about
ten
took
boat
with
lauderdale
only
and
two
ordinary
attendants
and
rowed
awhile
as
towards
the
bridge
and
soon
turned
back
to
the
parliament
stairs
and
so
went
up
into
the
house
of
lords
and
took
his
seat
almost
all
of
them
were
amazed
but
all
seemed
so
and
the
duke
of
york
especially
was
very
much
surprized
being
sat
he
told
them
it
was
a
privilege
he
claimed
from
his
ancestors
to
be
present
at
their
deliberations
that
therefore
they
should
not
for
his
coming
interrupt
their
debates
but
proceed
and
be
covered
they
did
so
it
is
true
that
this
has
been
done
long
ago
but
it
is
now
so
old
that
it
is
new
and
so
disused
that
at
any
other
but
so
bewitched
a
time
as
this
it
would
have
been
looked
on
as
an
high
usurpation
and
breach
of
privilege
he
indeed
sat
still
for
the
most
part
and
interposed
very
little
sometimes
a
word
or
two
but
the
most
discerning
opinion
was
that
he
did
herein
as
he
rowed
for
having
had
his
face
first
to
the
conventicle
bill
he
turned
short
to
the
lord
ross
so
that
indeed
it
is
credible
the
king
in
prospect
of
diminishing
the
duke
of
york
influence
in
the
lord
house
in
this
or
any
future
matter
resolved
and
wisely
enough
at
present
to
weigh
up
and
lighten
the
duke
efficacy
by
coming
himself
in
person
after
three
or
four
days
continuance
the
lords
were
very
well
used
to
the
king
presence
and
sent
the
lord
steward
and
lord
chamberlain
to
him
when
they
might
wait
as
an
house
on
him
to
render
their
humble
thanks
for
the
honour
he
did
them
the
hour
was
appointed
them
and
they
thanked
him
and
he
took
it
well
so
this
matter
of
such
importance
on
all
great
occasions
seems
riveted
to
them
and
us
for
the
future
and
to
all
posterity
now
the
lord
ross
bill
came
in
order
to
another
debate
and
the
king
present
nevertheless
the
debate
lasted
an
entire
day
and
it
passed
by
very
few
voices
the
king
has
ever
since
continued
his
session
among
them
and
says
it
is
better
than
going
to
a
play
in
this
session
the
lords
sent
down
to
us
a
proviso
for
the
king
that
would
have
restored
him
to
all
civil
or
ecclesiastical
prerogatives
which
his
ancestors
had
enjoyed
at
any
time
since
the
conquest
there
was
never
so
compendious
a
piece
of
absolute
universal
tyranny
but
the
commons
made
them
ashamed
of
it
and
retrenched
it
the
parliament
was
never
embarrassed

recovery

do
justice
to
the

side
possibly
they
do
not
read
it
and
parker
has
been
severely
handled
by
my
predecessors
he
was
not
an
honour
to
his
profession
being
perhaps
as
good
or
as
bad
a
representative
of
the
seamy
side
of
state
churchism
as
there
is
to
be
found
he
was
the
son
of
a
puritan
father
and
whilst
at
wadham
lived
by
rule
fasting
and
praying
he
took
his
degree
in
the
early
part
of
and
migrating
to
trinity
came
under
the
influence
of
bathurst
then
senior
fellow
to
whom
so
he
says
in
one
of
his
dedications
i
owe
my
first
rescue
from
the
chains
and
fetters
of
an
unhappy
education
anything
parker
did
he
did
completely
and
we
next
hear
of
him
in
london
in
a
nobleman
chaplain
setting
the
table
in
a
roar
by
making
fun
of
his
former
friends
a
mimical
way
of
drolling
upon
the
puritans
he
followed
the
haunted
the
best
companies
and
to
polish
himself
from
any
pedantic
roughness
he
read
and
saw
the
plays
with
much
care
and
more
preparing
than
most
of
the
auditory
in
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
sheldon
a
very
mundane
person
indeed
made
parker
his
chaplain
and
three
years
later
archdeacon
of
canterbury
he
reached
many
preferments
so
that
says
marvell
his
head
swell
like
any
bladder
with
wind
and
vapour
he
had
an
active
pen
and
a
considerable
range
of
subject
in
he
produced
a
discourse
of
ecclesiastical
politie
wherein
the
authority
of
the
civil
magistrate
over
the
consciences
of
subjects
in
matters
of
external
religion
is
asserted
the
mischiefs
and
inconveniences
of
toleration
are
represented
and
all
pretenses
pleaded
in
behalf
of
of
are
fully
answered
some
one
instantly
took
up
the
cudgels
in
a
pamphlet
entitled
and
impudence
and
the
famous
owen
also
protested
in
and
innocence
parker
replied
to
owen
in
defence
and
continuation
of
ecclesiastical
and
in
the
following
year
reprinted
a
treatise
of
bishop
bramholl
with
a
preface
shewing
what
grounds
there
are
of
fears
and
jealousies
of
popery
this
was
the
state
of
the
controversy
when
marvell
entered
upon
it
with
his
a
fantastic
title
he
borrowed
for
no
very
good
reasons
from
the
farce
of
the
hour
and
a
very
good
farce
too
the
duke
of
buckingham
which
was
performed
for
the
first
time
at
the
theatre
royal
on
the
of
november
and
printed
early
in
most
of
us
have
read
sheridan
before
we
read
buckingham
which
is
not
the
way
to
do
justice
to
the
earlier
piece
it
is
a
matter
of
literary
tradition
that
the
duke
had
much
help
in
the
composition
of
a
farce
it
took
ten
years
to
make
butler
sprat
and
clifford
the
master
of
charterhouse
are
said
to
be
however
this
may
be
the
piece
was
a
great
success
and
both
marvell
and
parker
i
have
no
doubt
greatly
enjoyed
it
but
i
can
not
think
the
former
was
wise
to
stuff
his
plea
for
liberty
of
conscience
so
full
as
he
did
with
the
details
of
a
farce
his
doing
so
should
at
all

acquit

it

are
those
rules
i
pray
why
sir
my
first
rule
is
the
rule
of
transversion
or
changing
verse
into
prose
or
prose
into
verse
as
you
please
how
that
sir
by
a
rule
i
pray
why
thus
sir
nothing
more
easy
when
understood
i
take
a
book
in
my
hand
either
at
home
or
elsewhere
for
that
all
one
if
there
be
any
wit
in
as
there
is
no
book
but
has
some
i
transverse
it
that
is
if
it
be
prose
put
it
into
verse
but
that
takes
up
some
time
if
it
be
verse
put
it
into
prose
methinks
that
putting
verse
into
prose
should
be
called
transprosing
by
my
troth
a
very
good
notion
and
hereafter
it
shall
be
so
marvell
must
be
taken
to
have
meant
by
his
title
that
he
saw
some
resemblance
between
parker
and
bayes
and
indeed
he
says
he
does
and
gives
that
as
one
of
his
excuses
for
calling
parker
bayes
all
through
but
before
i
commit
myself
to
the
dangerous
depths
of
his
discourse
which
i
am
now
upon
the
brink
of
i
would
with
his
leave
make
a
motion
that
instead
of
author
i
may
henceforth
indifferently
well
call
him
bayes
as
oft
as
i
shall
see
occasion
and
that
first
because
he
has
no
name
or
at
least
will
not
own
it
though
he
himself
writes
under
the
greatest
security
and
gives
us
the
first
letters
of
other
men
names
before
he
be
asked
them
secondly
because
he
is
i
perceive
a
lover
of
elegancy
of
style
and
can
endure
no
man
tautologies
but
his
own
and
therefore
i
would
not
distaste
him
with
too
frequent
repetition
of
one
word
but
chiefly
because
bayes
and
he
do
very
much
symbolise
in
their
understandings
in
their
expressions
in
their
humour
in
their
contempt
and
quarrelling
of
all
others
though
of
their
own
profession
but
justice
must
be
done
even
to
parker
before
handing
him
over
to
the
tormentor
what
were
his
positions
he
was
a
essentially
irreligious
fellow
the
accredited
author
of
the
reply
to
the
question
what
is
the
best
body
of
divinity
that
which
would
help
a
man
to
keep
a
coach
and
six
horses
but
he
is
a
lucid
and
vigorous
writer
knowing
very
well
that
he
had
to
steer
his
ship
through
a
narrow
and
dangerous
channel
avoiding
hobbism
on
the
one
side
and
tender
consciences
on
the
other
each
generation
of
state
churchmen
has
the
same
task
the
channel
remains
just
as
it
ever
did
with
scylla
and
charybdis
presiding
over
their
rocks
as
of
old
hobbes
appeared
in
and
in
both
his
philosophy
and
his
statecraft
were
fashionable
doctrine
all
really
pious
people
called
hobbes
an
atheist
technically
he
was
nothing
of
the
sort
but
it
matters
little
what
he
was
technically
since
no
plain
man
who
can
read
can
doubt
that
hobbes
enthronement
of
the
state
was
the
dethronement
of
god
seeing
then
that
in
every
christian
commonwealth
the
civil
sovereign
is
the
supreme
factor
to
whose
charge
the
whole
flock
of
his
subjects
is
commuted
and
consequently
that
it
is
by
his
authority
that
all
other
pastors
are
made
and
have
power
to
teach
and
perform
all
other
pastoral
offices
it
followeth
also
that
it
is
from
the
civil
sovereign
that
all
other
pastors
derive
their
right
of
teaching
preaching
and
other
functions
pertaining
to
that
office
and
that
they
are
but
his
ministers
in
the
same
way
as
the
magistrates
of
towns
judges
in
court
of
justice
and
commanders
of
assizes
are
all
but
ministers
of
him
that
is
the
magistrate
of
the
whole
commonwealth
judge
of
all
causes
and
commander
of
the
whole
militia
which
is
always
the
civil
sovereign
and
the
reason
hereof
is
not
because
they
that
teach
but
because
they
that
are
to
learn
are
his
subjects
hobbes
edition
vol
iii
p
hobbes
shirks
nothing
and
asks
himself
the
question
what
if
a
king
or
a
senate
or
other
sovereign
person
forbid
us
to
believe
in
christ
the
answer
given
is
such
forbidding
is
of
no
effect
because
belief
and
unbelief
never
follow
men
commands
but
suppose
we
be
commanded
by
our
lawful
prince
to
say
with
our
tongue
we
believe
not
must
we
obey
such
command
here
hobbes
a
little
hesitates
to
say
outright
yes
you
must
but
he
does
say
whatsoever
a
subject
is
compelled
to
do
in
obedience
to
his
own
sovereign
and
doth
it
not
in
order
to
his
own
mind
but
in
order
to
the
laws
of
his
country
that
action
is
not
his
but
his
sovereign
nor
is
it
that
he
in
this
case
denieth
christ
before
men
but
his
governor
and
the
law
of
his
country
hobbes
then
puts
the
case
of
a
mahomedan
subject
of
a
christian
commonwealth
who
is
required
under
pain
of
death
to
be
present
at
the
divine
service
of
the
christian
church
what
is
he
to
do
if
says
hobbes
you
say
he
ought
to
die
then
you
authorise
all
private
men
to
disobey
their
princes
in
maintenance
of
their
religion
true
or
false
and
if
you
say
the
mahomedan
ought
to
obey
you
admit
hobbes
proposition
and
ought
to
consent
to
be
yourself
bound
by
it
see
hobbes
iii
the
church
of
england
though
anxious
both
to
support
the
king
and
suppress
the
dissenters
could
not
stomach
hobbes
but
if
it
could
not
how
was
it
to
deal
with
hobbes
question
if
it
is
right
to
disobey
your
lawful
prince
who
is
to
determine
it
is
right
parker
seeks
to
grapple
with
this
difficulty
he
disowns
hobbes
when
men
have
once
swallowed
this
principle
that
mankind
is
free
from
all
obligations
antecedent
to
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
and
that
the
will
of
the
sovereign
power
is
the
only
measure
of
good
and
evil
they
proceed
suitably
to
its
consequences
to
believe
that
no
religion
can
obtain
the
force
of
law
till
it
is
established
as
such
by
supreme
authority
that
the
holy
scriptures
were
not
laws
to
any
man
till
they
were
enjoyn
by
the
christian
magistrate
and
that
if
the
sovereign
power
would
declare
the
alcoran
to
be
canonical
scripture
it
would
be
as
much
the
word
of
god
as
the
four
gospels
see
vol
iii
p
so
that
all
religions
are
in
reality
nothing
but
cheats
and
impostures
to
awe
the
common
people
to
obedience
and
therefore
although
princes
may
wisely
make
use
of
the
foibles
of
religion
to
serve
their
own
turns
upon
the
silly
multitude
yet
is
below
their
wisdom
to
be
seriously
concerned
themselves
for
such
fooleries
parker
p
as
against
this
fashionable
hobbism
parker
pleads
conscience
when
anything
that
is
apparently
and
intrinsically
evil
is
the
matter
of
a
human
law
whether
it
be
of
a
civil
or
ecclesiastical
concern
here
god
is
to
be
obeyed
rather
than
man
he
forcibly
adds
those
who
would
take
off
from
the
consciences
of
men
all
obligations
antecedent
to
those
of
human
laws
instead
of
making
the
power
of
princes
supreme
absolute
and
uncontrollable
they
utterly
enervate
all
their
authority
and
set
their
subjects
at
perfect
liberty
from
all
their
commands
for
if
we
once
remove
all
the
antecedent
obligations
of
conscience
and
religion
men
will
no
further
be
bound
to
submit
to
their
laws
than
only
as
themselves
shall
see
convenient
and
if
they
are
under
no
other
restraint
it
will
be
their
wisdom
to
rebel
as
oft
as
it
is
their
interest
pp
but
though
when
dealing
with
hobbes
parker
thinks
fit
to
assert
the
claims
of
conscience
so
strongly
when
he
has
to
grapple
with
those
who
like
the
immortal
author
of
pilgrim
devilishly
and
perniciously
abstained
from
coming
to
church
and
upheld
unlawful
meetings
and
conventicles
his
tone
alters
and
it
is
hard
to
distinguish
his
position
from
that
of
the
philosopher
of
malmesbury
parker
argument
briefly
stated
and
as
much
as
possible
in
his
own
vigorous
language
comes
to
this
there
is
and
always
must
be
a
competition
between
the
prerogative
of
the
prince
or
state
and
that
of
conscience
which
on
this
occasion
is
defined
as
every
private
man
own
judgment
and
persuasion
of
things
do
subjects
rebel
against
their
sovereign
is
conscience
that
takes
up
arms
do
they
murder
kings
is
under
the
conduct
of
conscience
do
they
separate
from
the
communion
of
the
church
is
conscience
that
is
the
schismatick
everything
that
a
man
has
a
mind
to
is
his
conscience
p
how
is
this
competition
to
be
resolved
parker
answers
in
exact
language
which
would
have
met
with
john
austin
warm
approval
the
supreme
government
of
every
commonwealth
wherever
it
is
lodged
must
of
necessity
be
universal
absolute
and
uncontrollable
for
if
it
be
limited
it
may
be
controlled
but
is
a
thick
and
palpable
contradiction
to
call
such
a
power
supreme
in
that
whatever
controls
it
must
as
to
that
case
be
its
superior
and
therefore
affairs
of
religion
being
so
strongly
influential
upon
affairs
of
state
they
must
be
as
uncontrollably
subject
to
the
supreme
power
as
all
other
civil
concerns
p
if
the
magistrate
may
make
penal
laws
against
swearing
and
blasphemy
why
not
as
to
rites
and
ceremonies
of
public
worship
devotion
towards
god
is
a
virtue
akin
to
gratitude
to
man
religion
is
a
branch
of
morality
the
puritans
talk
about
grace
is
a
mere
imposture
which
extracts
from
parker
vehement
language
what
is
there
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
he
cries
why
can
not
you
come
to
church
you
are
left
free
to
what
you
like
your
secret
thoughts
are
your
own
but
living
as
you
do
in
society
and
knowing
as
you
must
how
unless
the
law
interferes
every
opinion
must
make
a
sect
and
every
sect
a
faction
and
every
faction
when
it
is
able
a
war
and
every
war
is
the
cause
of
god
and
the
cause
of
god
can
never
be
prosecuted
with
too
much
violence
why
can
not
you
conform
to
a
form
of
worship
which
though
it
does
not
profess
to
be
prescribed
in
all
particulars
contains
nothing
actually
forbidden
in
the
scriptures
what
authority
have
dissenters
for
singing
psalms
in
metre
where
has
our
saviour
or
his
apostles
enjoined
a
directory
for
public
worship
what
scripture
command
is
there
for
the
significant
ceremonies
of
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
viz
that
the
whole
congregation
should
take
it
uncovered
standing
with
their
right
hand
lift
up
bare
and
so
on
in
answer
to
the
objection
that
the
civil
magistrate
might
establish
a
worship
in
its
own
nature
sinful
and
sensual
parker
replies
it
is
not
in
the
least
likely
and
the
risk
must
be
run
our
enquiry
is
to
find
out
the
best
way
of
settling
the
world
that
the
state
of
things
admit
of
if
indeed
mankind
were
infallible
this
controversy
were
at
an
end
but
seeing
that
all
men
are
liable
to
errors
and
mistakes
and
seeing
that
there
is
an
absolute
necessity
of
a
supreme
power
in
all
public
affairs
our
question
i
say
is
what
is
the
most
prudent
and
expedient
way
of
settling
them
not
that
possibly
might
be
but
that
really
is
and
this
as
i
have
already
sufficiently
proved
is
to
devolve
their
management
on
the
supreme
civil
power
which
though
it
may
be
imperfect
and
liable
to
errors
and
mistakes
yet
is
the
least
so
and
is
a
much
better
way
to
attain
public
peace
and
tranquillity
than
if
they
were
left
to
the
ignorance
and
folly
of
every
private
man
i
now
feel
that
at
least
i
have
done
parker
full
justice
but
as
so
far
i
have
hardly
given
an
example
of
his
familiar
style
i
must
find
room
for
two
or
three
final
quotations
the
thing
parker
hated
most
in
the
world
was
a
he
protests
against
the
weakness
which
is
content
with
passing
penal
laws
but
does
not
see
them
carried
out
for
fear
of
wounding
these
trumpery
tender
consciences
most
minds
or
consciences
are
weak
silly
and
ignorant
things
acted
by
fond
and
absurd
principles
and
imposed
upon
by
their
vices
and
their
passions
however
if
the
obligation
of
laws
must
yield
to
that
of
a
tender
conscience
how
impregnably
is
every
man
that
has
a
mind
to
disobey
armed
against
all
the
commands
of
his
superiors
no
authority
shall
be
able
to
govern
him
farther
than
he
himself
pleases
and
if
he
dislike
the
law
he
is
sufficiently
excused
a
weak
conscience
is
the
product
of
a
weak
understanding
and
he
is
a
very
subtil
man
that
can
find
the
difference
between
a
tender
head
and
a
tender
conscience
it
is
a
glorious
thing
to
suffer
for
a
tender
conscience
and
therefore
it
is
easy
and
natural
for
some
people
to
affect
some
little
scruples
against
the
commands
of
authority
thereby
to
make
themselves
obnoxious
to
some
little
penalties
and
then
what
godly
men
are
they
that
are
so
ready
to
be
punished
for
a
good
conscience
the
voice
of
the
publick
law
can
not
but
drown
the
uncertain
whispers
of
a
tender
conscience
all
its
scruples
are
hushed
and
silenced
by
the
commands
of
authority
it
dares
not
whimper
when
that
forbids
and
the
nod
of
a
prince
awes
it
into
silence
and
submission
but
if
they
dare
to
murmur
and
their
proud
stomachs
will
swell
against
the
rebukes
of
their
superiors
then
there
is
no
remedy
but
the
rod
and
correction
they
must
be
chastised
out
of
their
peevishness
and
lashed
into
obedience
the
doctor
concludes
his
treatise
with
the
words
always
dear
to
men
of

opinions
i
have
written
i
have
written
whilst
parker
was
writing
this
book
in
his
snug
quarters
in
the
archbishop
palace
at
lambeth
bunyan
was
in
prison
in

refusing

and
jealousies

after
marvell
own
fashion
with
all
three
of
parker
books
the
the
and
the
of
the
ecclesiastical
it
is
by
no
means
so
easy
to
give
a
fair
notion
of
the
in
a
short
compass
as
it
was
of
parker
line
of
argument
the
parson
wrote
more
closely
than
the
member
of
parliament
i
can
not
give
a
better
description
of
marvell
method
than
in
parker
own
words
in
his
preface
to
his
to
the
rehearsal
which
appeared
in
and
gave
rise
to
marvell
second
part
when
writes
parker
i
first
condemned
myself
to
the
drudgery
of
this
reply
i
intended
nothing
but
a
serious
prosecution
of
my
argument
and
to
let
the
world
see
that
it
is
not
reading
histories
or
plays
or
gazettes
nor
going
on
pilgrimage
to
geneva
nor
learning
french
and
italian
nor
passing
the
alps
nor
being
a
cunning
gamester
that
can
qualify
a
man
to
discourse
of
conscience
and
ecclesiastical
policy
in
that
it
is
not
capping
our
argument
with
a
story
that
will
answer
it
nor
clapping
an
apothegm
upon
an
assertion
that
will
prove
it
nor
stringing
up
proverbs
and
similitudes
upon
one
another
that
will
make
up
a
coherent
discourse
allowing
for
bias
this
is
no
unfair
account
of
marvell
method
and
it
was
just
because
this
was
marvell
method
that
he
succeeded
so
well
in
amusing
the
king
and
in
pleasing
the
town
and
that
he
may
still
be
read
by
those
who
love
reading
with
a
fair
measure
of
interest
and
enjoyment
witty
and
humorous
men
are
always
at
a
disadvantage
except
on
the
stage
the
is
the
style
for
englishmen
bishop
burnet
calls
marvell
a
droll
parker
who
was
to
be
a
bishop
calls
him
a
buffoon
marvell
is
occasionally
humorous
and
not
infrequently
carries
a
jest
beyond
the
limits
of
becoming
mirth
but
he
is
more
often
grave
yet
when
he
is
his
gravity
was
treated
either
as
one
of
his
feebler
jokes
or
as
an
impertinence
but
as
it
is
his
wit
alone
that
has
kept
him
alive
he
need
not
be
pitied
overmuch
the
substance
of
marvell
reply
to
parker
apart
altogether
from
its
is
to
be
found
in
passages
like
the
following
here
it
is
that
after
so
great
an
excess
of
wit
he
thinks
fit
to
take
a
julep
and
his
brain
and
the
government
he
grows
as
serious
as
is
possible
for
a
madman
and
pretends
to
the
whole
state
of
the
controversy
with
the
nonconformists
and
to
be
sure
he
will
make
the
story
as
plausible
for
himself
as
he
may
but
therefore
it
was
that
i
have
before
so
particularly
quoted
and
bound
him
up
with
his
own
words
as
fast
as
such
a
proteus
could
be
pinion
for
he
is
as
waxen
as
the
first
matter
and
no
form
comes
amiss
to
him
every
change
of
posture
does
either
alter
his
opinion
or
vary
the
expression
by
which
we
should
judge
of
it
and
sitting
he
is
of
one
mind
and
standing
of
another
therefore
i
take
myself
the
less
concern
to
fight
with
a
windmill
like
quixote
or
to
whip
a
gig
as
boyes
do
or
with
the
lacqueys
at
or
to
play
at
the
wheel
of
fortune
lest
i
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
my
lord
or
sir
edmond
godfrey
the
truth
is
in
short
and
let
bayes
make
more
or
less
of
it
if
he
can
bayes
had
at
first
such
a
stupendous
magistrate
as
never
was
of
god
making
he
had
put
all
princes
upon
the
rack
to
stretch
them
to
his
dimension
and
as
a
straight
line
continued
grows
a
circle
he
had
given
them
so
infinite
a
power
that
it
was
extended
unto
impotency
for
though
he
found
it
not
till
it
was
too
late
in
the
cause
yet
he
felt
it
all
along
which
is
the
understanding
of
brutes
in
the
effect
for
hence
it
is
that
he
so
often
complains
that
princes
know
not
aright
that
supremacy
over
consciences
to
which
they
were
so
lately
since
their
deserting
the
church
of
rome
restored
that
in
most
nations
government
was
not
rightly
understood
and
many
expressions
of
that
nature
whereas
indeed
the
matter
is
that
princes
have
always
found
that
uncontroulable
government
over
to
be
both
unsafe
and
impracticable
he
had
run
himself
here
to
a
stand
and
perceived
that
there
was
a
god
there
was
scripture
the
magistrate
himself
had
a
conscience
and
must
care
that
he
did
not
enjoyn
things
apparently
evil
but
after
all
he
finds
himself
again
at
the
same
stand
here
and
is
run
up
to
the
wall
by
an
angel
god
and
scripture
and
conscience
will
not
let
him
go
further
but
he
owns
that
if
the
magistrate
enjoyns
things
apparently
evil
the
subject
may
have
liberty
to
remonstrate
what
shall
he
do
then
for
it
is
too
glorious
an
enterprize
to
be
abandoned
at
the
first
rebuffe
why
he
gives
us
a
new
translation
of
the
bible
and
a
new
commentary
he
saith
that
tenderness
of
conscience
might
be
allowed
in
a
church
to
be
constituted
not
in
a
church
constituted
already
that
tenderness
of
conscience
and
scandal
are
ignorance
pride
and
obstinacy
he
saith
the
nonconformists
should
communicate
with
him
till
they
have
clear
evidence
that
it
is
evil
this
is
a
civil
way
indeed
of
gaining
the
question
to
perswade
men
that
are
unsatisfied
to
be
satisfied
till
they
be
dissatisfied
he
threatens
he
rails
he
jeers
them
if
it
were
possible
out
of
all
their
consciences
and
honesty
and
finding
that
will
not
do
he
calls
out
the
magistrate
tells
him
these
men
are
not
fit
to
live
there
can
be
no
security
of
government
while
they
are
in
being
bring
out
the
pillories
gallies
rods
and
axes
which
are
ultima
a
clergyman
last
argument
ay
and
his
first
too
and
pull
in
pieces
all
the
trading
corporations
those
nests
of
faction
and
sedition
this
is
a
faithful
account
of
the
sum
and
intention
of
all
his
undertaking
for
which
i
confess
he
was
as
pick
a
man
as
could
have
been
employed
or
found
out
in
a
whole
kingdome
but
it
is
so
much
too
hard
a
task
for
any
man
to
atchieve
that
no
goose
but
would
grow
giddy
with
it
in
reply
to
what
parker
had
written
about
the
unreasonable
fuss
made
by
the
dissenters
over
the
two
or
three
symbolical
ceremonies
called
sacraments
marvell
says
they
the
nonconformists
complain
that
these
things
should
be
imposed
on
them
with
so
high
a
penalty
as
want
nothing
of
a
sacramental
nature
but
divine
institution
and
because
a
human
institution
is
herein
made
of
equal
force
to
a
divine
institution
therefore
it
is
that
they
are
aggrieved
for
without
the
sign
of
the
cross
our
church
will
not
receive
any
one
in
baptism
as
also
without
kneeling
no
man
is
suffered
to
come
to
the
communion
but
here
i
say
then
is
their
the
nonconformists
main
exception
that
things
indifferent
and
that
have
no
proper
signature
or
significancy
to
that
purpose
should
by
command
be
made
conditions
of
i
have
many
times
wished
for
peaceableness
sake
that
they
had
a
greater
latitude
but
if
unless
they
should
stretch
their
consciences
till
they
tear
again
they
can
not
conform
what
remedy
for
i
must
confess
that
christians
have
a
better
right
and
title
to
the
church
and
to
the
ordinances
of
god
there
than
the
author
hath
to
his
surplice
bishop
bramhall
saith
do
profess
to
all
the
world
that
the
transforming
of
indifferent
opinions
into
necessary
articles
of
faith
hath
been
that
or
cursed
bay
tree
the
cause
of
all
our
brawling
and
contention
that
which
he
saw
in
matter
of
doctrine
he
would
not
discern
in
discipline
it
is
true
and
very
piously
done
that
our
church
doth
declare
that
the
kneeling
at
the
lord
supper
is
not
enjoined
for
adoration
of
those
elements
and
concerning
the
other
ceremonies
as
before
but
the
romanists
from
whom
we
have
them
and
who
said
of
old
we
would
come
to
feed
on
their
meat
as
well
as
eat
of
their
porridge
do
offer
us
here
many
a
fair
declaration
and
distinction
in
very
weighty
matters
to
which
nevertheless
the
conscience
of
our
church
hath
not
complyed
but
in
this
particular
matter
of
kneeling
which
came
in
first
with
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
the
romish
church
do
reproach
us
with
flat
idolatry
in
that
we
not
believing
the
real
presence
in
the
bread
and
wine
yet
do
pay
to
something
or
other
the
same
adoration
suppose
the
ancient
pagans
had
declared
to
the
primitive
christians
that
the
offerings
of
some
grains
of
incense
was
only
to
perfume
the
room
do
you
think
the
christians
would
have
palliated
so
far
and
colluded
with
their
consciences
therefore
although
the
church
do
consider
herself
so
much
as
not
to
alter
her
mode
unto
the
fashion
of
others
yet
i
can
not
see
why
she
ought
to
exclude
those
from
communion
whose
weaker
consciences
can
not
for
fear
of
scandal
step
further
with
parker
thunders
and
threats
of
the
authority
of
princes
and
states
marvell
deals
more
in
the
mood
of
a
statesman
than
of
a
philosopher
more
as
a
man
of
affairs
than
as
a
jurist
he
deplores
the
ferocity
of
parker
tone
and
that
of
a
certain
number
of
the
clergy
why
is
it
he
asks
that
this
kind
of
clergy
should
always
be
and
have
been
for
the
most
precipitate
brutish
and
sanguinary
counsels
the
former
civil
war
can
not
make
them
wise
nor
his
majesty
happy
return
but
they
are
still
for
running
things
up
unto
the
same
extremes
the
softness
of
the
universities
where
they
have
been
bred
the
gentleness
of
christianity
in
which
they
have
been
nurtured
hath
but
exasperated
their
nature
and
they
seem
to
have
contracted
no
idea
of
wisdom
but
what
they
learnt
at
school
the
pedantry
of
whipping
for
whether
it
be
or
no
that
the
clergy
are
not
so
well
fitted
by
education
as
others
for
political
affairs
i
know
not
though
i
should
rather
think
they
have
advantage
above
others
and
even
if
they
would
but
keep
to
their
bibles
might
make
the
best
ministers
of
state
in
the
world
yet
it
is
generally
observed
that
things
miscarry
under
their
government
if
there
be
any
council
more
precipitate
more
violent
more
extreme
than
other
it
is
theirs
truly
i
think
the
reason
that
god
does
not
bless
them
in
affairs
of
state
is
because
he
never
intended
them
for
that
employment
of
archbishop
laud
and
charles
the
first
marvell
says
i
am
confident
the
bishop
studied
to
do
both
god
and
his
majesty
good
service
but
alas
how
utterly
was
he
mistaken
though
so
learned
so
pious
so
wise
a
man
he
seem
to
know
nothing
beyond
ceremonies
armenianism
and
mainwaring
with
that
he
begun
with
that
ended
and
thereby
deform
the
whole
reign
of
the
best
prince
that
ever
wielded
the
english
sceptre
for
his
late
majesty
being
a
prince
truly
pious
and
religious
was
therefore
the
more
inclined
to
esteem
and
favour
the
clergy
and
thence
though
himself
of
a
most
exquisite
understanding
yet
he
could
not
trust
it
better
than
in
their
treatment
whereas
every
man
is
best
at
his
own
post
and
so
the
preacher
in
the
pulpit
kings
marvell
points
out
to
parker
must
take
wider
views
than
parsons
is
not
with
them
as
with
you
you
have
but
one
cure
of
souls
or
perhaps
two
as
being
a
nobleman
chaplain
to
look
after
and
if
you
made
conscience
of
discharging
them
as
you
ought
you
would
find
you
had
work
sufficient
without
writing
your
policies
but
they
are
the
incumbents
of
whole
kingdoms
and
the
rectorship
of
the
common
people
the
nobility
and
even
of
the
clergy
the
care
i
say
of
all
this
rests
on
them
so
that
they
are
fain
to
condescend
to
many
things
for
peace
sake
and
the
quiet
of
mankind
that
your
proud
heart
would
break
before
it
would
bend
to
they
do
not
think
fit
to
require
any
thing
that
is
impossible
unnecessary
or
wanton
of
their
people
but
are
fain
to
consider
the
very
temper
of
the
climate
in
which
they
live
the
constitution
and
laws
under
which
they
have
been
formerly
bred
and
upon
all
occasions
to
give
them
good
words
and
humour
them
like
children
they
reflect
upon
the
histories
of
former
times
and
the
present
transactions
to
regulate
themselves
by
in
every
circumstance
they
kings
do
not
think
fit
to
command
things
unnecessary
these
extracts
however
fatal
to
marvell
traditional
reputation
in
the
eighteenth
century
as
a
puritan
and
a
republican
call
for
no
apology
an
example
of
marvell
interludes
ought
to
be
given
there
are
many
to
choose
from
there
was
a
worthy
divine
not
many
years
dead
who
in
his
younger
time
being
of
a
facetious
and
unlucky
humour
was
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
tom
triplet
he
was
brought
up
at
paul
school
under
a
severe
master
gill
and
from
thence
he
went
to
the
university
there
he
took
liberty
as
is
usual
with
those
that
are
emancipated
from
school
to
tel
tales
and
make
the
discipline
ridiculous
under
which
he
was
bred
but
not
suspecting
the
doctor
intelligence
coming
once
to
town
he
went
in
full
school
to
give
him
a
visite
and
expected
no
less
than
to
get
a
play
day
for
his
former
acquaintances
but
instead
of
that
he
found
himself
hors
up
in
a
trice
though
he
appeal
in
vain
to
the
priviledges
of
the
university
pleaded
and
invoked
the
mercy
of
the
spectators
nor
was
he
let
down
till
the
master
had
planted
a
grove
of
birch
in
his
for
the
terrour
and
publick
example
of
all
waggs
that
divulge
the
secrets
of
priscian
and
make
merry
with
their
teachers
this
stuck
so
with
triplet
that
all
his
he
never
forgave
the
doctor
but
sent
him
every
new
year
tide
an
anniversary
ballad
to
a
new
tune
and
so
in
his
turn
avenged
himself
of
his
jerking
pedagogue
marvell
game
of
picquet
with
a
parson
plays
such
a
part
in
to
the
that
it
deserves
to
be
mentioned
is
not
very
many
years
ago
that
i
used
to
play
at
picket
there
was
a
gentleman
of
your
robe
a
dignitory
of
lincoln
very
well
known
and
remembered
in
the
ordinaries
but
being
not
long
since
dead
i
will
save
his
name
now
i
used
to
play
pieces
and
this
gentleman
would
always
go
with
me
and
so
all
the
while
he
sate
on
my
hand
he
very
honestly
the
so
that
i
was
always
sure
to
lose
i
afterwards
discovered
it
but
of
all
the
money
that
ever
i
was
cheated
of
in
my
life
none
ever
vexed
me
so
as
what
i
lost
by
his
occasion
there
is
no
need
to
pursue
the
controversy
further
it
is
still
unsettled
parker
published
in
is
less
argumentative
and
naturally
enough
more
personal
than
the
any
use
i
now
make
of
it
will
be
purely
biographical
let
us
see
andrew
marvell
depicted
by
an
angry
parson
not
in
passages
of
mere
abuse
as
thou
dastard
craven
thou
swad
thou
mushroom
thou
coward
in
heart
word
and
deed
thou
judas
thou
crocodile
for
epithets
such
as
these
are
of
no
use
to
a
biographer
but
in
places
where
marvell
is
at
least
made
to
sit
for
the
portrait
however
and
if
i
would
study
revenge
i
could
easily
have
requited
you
with
the
novels
of
a
certain
jack
gentleman
that
was
born
of
pure
parents
and
bred
among
and
sent
from
school
to
the
university
and
from
the
university
to
the
gaming
ordinaries
but
the
young
man
being
easily
rooked
by
the
old
gamesters
he
was
sent
abroad
to
gain
courage
and
experience
and
beyond
sea
saw
the
bears
of
berne
and
the
large
race
of
capons
at
geneva
and
a
great
many
fine
sights
beside
and
so
returned
home
as
accomplished
as
he
went
out
tries
his
fortune
once
more
at
the
ordinaries
plays
too
high
for
a
gentleman
of
his
private
condition
and
so
is
at
length
cheated
of
all
at
picquet
and
now
to
conclude
is
it
not
a
sad
thing
that
a
and
fashionable
gentleman
that
has
frequented
ordinaries
that
has
worn
perukes
and
muffs
and
pantaloons
and
was
once
master
of
a
watch
that
has
travelled
abroad
and
seen
as
many
men
and
countries
as
the
famous
vertuosi
sorbier
and
coriat
that
has
heard
the
city
lions
roar
that
has
past
the
alps
and
seen
all
the
tredescin
rarities
and
old
stones
of
italy
that
has
sat
in
the
porphyric
chair
at
rome
that
can
describe
the
methods
of
the
elections
of
popes
and
tell
stories
of
the
tricks
of
cardinals
that
has
been
employed
in
embassies
abroad
and
acquainted
with
intrigues
of
state
at
home
that
has
read
plays
and
histories
and
gazettes
that
i
say
a
gentleman
thus
accomplished
and
embellished
within
and
without
and
all
over
should
ever
live
to
that
unhappy
dotage
as
at
last
to
dishonour
his
grey
hairs
and
his
venerable
age
with
such
childish
and
impotent
endeavours
at
wit
and
buffoonery
pp
marvell
was
very
little
over
fifty
years
of
his
age
at
this
time
nor
is
parker
portrait
to
be
regarded
as
truthful
in
any
other
particular
yet
something
of
a
man
character
may
be
discovered
by
noticing
the
way
he
is
abused
by
those
who
want
to
abuse
him
marvell
though
no
orator
or
even
debater
was
the
stuff
of
which
controversialists
are
made
in
a
letter
printed
in
the
duke
of
portland
papers
and
dated
may
he
writes
parker
will
be
out
the
next
week
i
have
seen
it
already
three
hundred
and
thirty
pages
and
it
will
be
much
more
it
was
five
hundred
pages
i
perceive
by
what
i
have
read
that
it
is
the
rudest
book
one
or
other
that
ever
was
published
i
may
say
since
the
first
invention
of
printing
although
it
handles
me
so
roughly
yet
i
am
not
at
all
amated
by
it
but
i
must
desire
the
advice
of
some
few
friends
to
tell
me
whether
it
will
be
proper
for
me
and
in
what
way
to
answer
it
however
i
will
for
mine
own
private
satisfaction
forthwith
draw
up
an
answer
that
shall
have
as
much
of
spirit
and
solidity
in
it
as
my
ability
will
afford
and
the
age
we
live
in
will
endure
i
am
if
i
may
say
it
with
reverence
drawn
in
i
hope
by
a
good
providence
to
intermeddle
on
a
noble
and
high
argument
but
i
desire
that
all
the
discourse
of
my
friends
may
run
as
if
no
answer
ought
to
be
expected
to

full
of

and
of
the
very
spirit
of
the
times
some
of
it
must
be
given
but
though
he
came
of
a
good
mother
he
had
a
very
ill
sire
he
was
a
man
bred
toward
the
law
and
betook
himself
as
his
best
practice
to
be
a
or
as
the
stile
ran
one
of
the
assistant
committee
in
northamptonshire
in
the
rapine
of
that
employment
and
what
he
got
by
picking
the
teeth
of
his
masters
he
sustain
himself
till
he
had
raked
together
some
little
estate

then

and
that
had
begun
his
fortune
out
of
the
sequestration
of

of

he
to
perfect
it
the
more
proceeded
to
take
away
their
lives
not
in
the
hot
and
military
way
which
diminishes
always
the
offence
but
in
the
cooler
blood
and
sedentary
execution
of
an
high
court
of
justice
accordingly
he
was
preferr
to
be
one
of
that
number
that
gave
sentence
against
the
three
lords
capel
holland
and
hamilton
who
were
beheaded
by
this
learning
in

he
became
worthy
of
the
degree
of
a
serjeant
and
sometimes
to
go

circuit
till
for
misdemeanor
he
was
petition
against
but
for
a
taste
of
his
abilities
and
the
more
to
reingratiate
himself
he
printed
in
the
year
a
very
remarkable
book
called
government

the
people
of
england

and

sufficient
to
have

of

by
these
parents
he
was
sent
to
oxford
with
intention
to
breed
him
up
to
the
ministry
there
in
a
short
time
he
enter
himself
into
the
company
of
some
young
students
who
were
used
to
fast
and
pray
weekly
together
but
for
their
refection
fed
sometimes
on
broth
from
whence
they
were
commonly
called
grewellers
only
it
was
observed
that
he
was
wont
still
to
put
more
graves
than
all
the
rest
in
his
porridge
and
after
that
he
pick
acquaintance
not
only
with
the
brotherhood
at
wadham
colledge
but
with
the
sisterhood
too
at
another
old
elsibeth
one
elizabeth
hampton
a
plain
devout
woman
where
he
train
himself
up
in
hearing
their
sermons
and
prayers
receiving
also
the
sacrament
in
the
house
till
he
had
gain
such
proficience
that
he
too
began
to
exercise
in
that
meeting
and
was
esteem
one
of
the
preciousest
young
men
in
the
university
but
when
thus
after
several
years
approbation
he
was
even
ready
to
have
taken
the
charge
not
of
an
drove
or
heard
as
he
now
calls
them
but
of
a
flock
upon
him
by
great
misfortune
the
king
came
in
by
the
miraculous
providence
of
god
influencing
the
distractions
of
some
the
good
affections
of
others
and
the
weariness
of
all
towards
that
happy
restauration
after
so
many
sufferings
to
his
regal
crown
and
dignity
nevertheless
he
broke
not
off
yet
from
his
former
habitudes
and
though
it
were
now
too
late
to
obviate
this
inconvenience
yet
he
persisted
as
far
as
in
him
was
that
is
by
praying
caballing
and
discoursing
to
obstruct
the
restoring
of
the
episcopal
government
revenues
and
authority
insomuch
that
finding
himself
discountenanced
on
those
accounts
by
the
then
warden
of
wadham
he
shifted
colledges
to
trinity
and
when
there
went
away
without
his
degree
scrupling
forsooth
the
subscription
then
required
from
thence
he
came
to
london
where
he
spent
a
considerable
time
in
creeping
into
all
corners
and
companies
horoscoping
up
and
down
concerning
the
duration
of
the
government
not
considering
anything
as
best
but
as
most
lasting
and
most
profitable
and
after
having
many
times
cast
a
figure
he
at
last
satisfyed
himself
that
the
episcopal
government
would
endure
as
long
as
this
king
lived
and
from
thence
forward
cast
about
how
to
be
admitted
into
the
church
of
england
and
find
the
highway
to
her
preferments
in
order
to
this
he
daily
enlarged
not
only
his
conversation
but
his
conscience
and
was
made
free
of
some
of
the
imagining
like
muleasses
king
of
tunis
for
i
take
witness
that
on
all
occasions
i
treat
him
rather
above
his
quality
than
otherwise
that
by
hiding
himself
among
the
onions
he
should
escape
being
traced
by
his
perfumes
ignorant
and
mistaken
man
that
thought
it
necessary
to
part
with
any
virtue
to
get
a
living
or
that
the
church
of
england
did
not
require
and
incourage
more
sobriety
than
he
could
ever
be
guilty
of
whereas
it
hath
alwayes
been
fruitful
of
men
who
together
with
obedience
to
that
discipline
have
lived
to
the
envy
of
the
nonconformists
in
their
conversation
and
without
such
could
never
either
have
been
preserved
so
long
or
after
so
long
a
dissipation
have
ever
recover
but
neither
was
this
yet
in
his
opinion
sufficient
and
therefore
he
resolv
to
try
a
shorter
path
which
some
few
men
had
trod
not
unsuccessfully
that
is
to
print
a
book
if
that
would
not
do
a
second
if
not
that
a
third
of
an
higher
extraction
and
so
forward
to
give
experiment
against
their
former
party
of
a
keen
stile
and
a
ductile
judgment
his
first
was
in
the
year
the
a
tedious
transcript
of
his
book
wherein
there
is
very
little
of
his
own
but
the
arrogance
and
the
unparalleled
censoriousness
that
he
exercises
over
all
other
writers
when
he
had
cook
up
these
musty
collections
he
makes
his
first
invitation
to
his
acquaintance
my
lord
archbishop
of
canterbury
who
had
never
seen
before
nor
heard
of
him
but
i
must
confess
he
his
grace
in
so
glorious
an
epistle
that
had
not
my
lord
been
long
since
proof
against
the
most
spiritual
flattery
the
dedication
only
without
ever
reading
the
book
might
have
serv
to
have
fix
him
from
that
instant
as
his
favourite
yet
all
this
i
perceive
did
not
his
work
but
his
grace
was
so
unmindful
or
rather
so
prudent
that
the
gentleman
thought
it
necessary
to
again
the
next
year
with
another
new
book
to
show
more
plainly
what
he
would
be
at
this
he
dedicates
to
doctor
bathurst
and
to
evidence
from
the
very
epistle
that
he
was
ready
to
renounce
that
very
education
the
civility
of
which
he
is
so
tender
of
as
to
blame
me
for
disordering
it
he
picks
occasion
to
tell
him
your
prevailing
advice
sir
do
i
owe
my
first
rescue
from
the
chains
and
fetters
of
an
unhappy
education
but
in
the
book
which
he
calls
free
and
impartial
censure
of
the
platonick
censure
is
sure
to
be
whatsoever
he
writes
he
speaks
out
and
demonstrates
himself
ready
and
equipp
to
surrender
not
only
the
cause
but
betray
his
party
without
making
any
conditions
for
them
and
to
appear
forthwith
himself
in
the
head
of
the
contrary
interest
which
supposing
the
dispute
to
be
just
yet
in
him
was
so
mercenary
that
none
would
have
descended
to
act
his
part
but
a
divine
of
fortune
and
even
lawyers
take
themselves
excused
from
being
of
counsel
for
the
king
himself
in
a
cause
where
they
have
been
entertain
and
instructed
by
their
client
but
so
flippant
he
was
and
forward
in
this
book
that
in
despight
of
all
chronology
he
could
introduce
plato
to
inveigh
against
calvin
and
from
the
platoniques
he
could
miraculously
a
discourse
against
the
nonconformists
plat
pp
etc
after
this
feat
of
activity
he
was
ready
to
leap
over
the
moon
no
scruple
of
conscience
could
stand
in
his
way
and
no
preferment
seemed
too
high
for
him
for
about
this
time
i
find
that
having
taken
a
turn
at
cambridge
to
qualifie
himself
he
was
received
within
doors
to
be
my
lord
archbishop
other
chaplain
and
into
some
degree
of
favour
which
considering
the
difference
of
their
humours
and
ages
was
somewhat
surprizing
but
whether
indeed
in
times
of
heat
and
faction
the
most
temperate
spirits
may
sometimes
chance
to
take
delight
in
one
that
is
spightful
and
make
some
use
of
him
or
whether
it
be
that
even
the
most
grave
and
serious
persons
do
for
relaxation
divert
themselves
willingly
by
whiles
with
a
creature
that
is
unlucky
inimical
and
gamesome
so
it
was
and
thenceforward
the
nimble
gentleman
danced
upon
vaulted
from
steeple
to
steeple
and
cut
capers
out
of
one
dignity
to
another
having
thus
dexterously
stuck
his
groat
in
lambeth
wainscot
it
may
easily
be
conceived
he
would
be
unwilling
to
lose
it
and
therefore
he
concern
himself
highly
and
even
to
jealousie
in
upholding
now
that
palace
which
if
falling
he
would
out
of
instinct
be
the
first
should
leave
it
his
majesty
about
that
time
labouring
to
effect
his
constant
promises
of
indulgence
to
his
people
the
author
therefore
walking
with
his
own
shadow
in
the
evening
took
a
great
fright
lest
all
were
agoe
and
in
this
conceit
being
resolv
to
make
good
his
figure
and
that
one
government
should
not
last
any
longer
than
the
other
he
set
himself
to
write
those
dangerous
books
which
i
have
now
to
do
with
wherein
he
first
makes
all
that
he
will
to
be
law
and
then
whatsoever
is
law
to
be
divinity
the
second
part
is
not
all
raillery
there
is
much
wisdom
in
it
and
a
trace
of
machiavelli
but
because
you
are
subject
to
misconstrue
even
true
english
i
will
explain
my
self
as
distinctly
as
i
can
and
as
close
as
possible
what
is
mine
own
opinion
in
this
matter
of
the
magistrate
and
government
that
seeing
i
have
blamed
you
where
i
thought
you
you
may
have
as
fair
hold
of
me
too
if
you
can
find
where
to
fix
your
accusation
the
power
of
the
magistrate
does
most
certainly
issue
from
the
divine
authority
the
obedience
due
to
that
power
is
by
divine
command
and
subjects
are
bound
both
as
men
and
as
christians
to
obey
the
magistrate
actively
in
all
things
where
their
duty
to
god
intercedes
not
and
however
passively
that
is
either
by
leaving
their
countrey
or
if
they
can
not
do
that
the
magistrate
or
the
reason
of
their
own
occasions
hindring
them
then
by
suffering
patiently
at
home
without
giving
the
least
publick
disturbance
but
the
dispute
concerning
the
magistrate
power
ought
to
be
superfluous
for
that
it
is
certainly
founded
upon
his
commission
from
god
and
for
the
most
part
sufficiently
fortified
with
all
humane
advantages
there
are
few
soveraign
princes
so
abridged
but
that
if
they
be
not
contented
they
may
envy
their
own
fortune
but
the
modester
question
if
men
will
needs
be
medling
with
matters
above
them
would
be
how
far
it
is
advisable
for
a
prince
to
exert
and
push
the
rigour
of
that
power
which
no
man
can
deny
him
for
princes
as
they
derive
the
right
of
succession
from
their
ancestors
so
they
inherit
from
that
ancient
and
illustrious
extraction
a
generosity
that
runs
in
the
blood
above
the
allay
of
the
rest
of
mankind
and
being
moreover
at
so
much
ease
of
honour
and
fortune
that
they
are
free
from
the
gripes
of
avarice
and
twinges
of
ambition
they
are
the
more
disposed
to
an
universal
benignity
toward
their
subjects
what
prince
that
sees
so
many
millions
of
men
either
labouring
industriously
toward
his
revenue
or
adventuring
their
lives
in
his
service
and
all
of
them
performing
his
commands
with
a
religious
obedience
but
conceives
at
the
same
time
a
relenting
tenderness
over
them
whereof
others
out
of
the
narrowness
of
their
minds
can
not
be
capable
but
whoever
shall
cast
his
eye
thorow
the
history
of
all
ages
will
find
that
nothing
has
alwayes
succeeded
better
with
princes
then
the
clemency
of
government
and
that
those
on
the
contrary
who
have
taken
the
sanguinary
course
have
been
unfortunate
to
themselves
and
the
people
the
consequences
not
being
separable
for
whether
that
royal
and
magnanimous
gentleness
spring
from
a
propensity
of
their
nature
or
be
acquired
and
confirmed
by
good
and
prudent
consideration
it
draws
along
with
it
all
the
effects
of
policy
the
wealth
of
a
shepherd
depends
upon
the
multitude
of
his
flock
the
goodness
of
their
pasture
and
the
quietness
of
their
feeding
and
princes
whose
dominion
over
mankind
resembles
in
some
measure
that
of
men
over
other
creatures
can
not
expect
any
considerable
increase
to
themselves
if
by
continual
terrour
they
amaze
shatter
and
hare
their
people
driving
them
into
woods
and
running
them
upon
precipices
if
men
do
but
compute
how
charming
an
efficacy
one
word
and
more
one
good
action
has
from
a
superior
upon
those
under
him
it
can
scarce
be
reckon
how
powerful
a
magick
there
is
in
a
prince
who
shall
by
a
constant
tenour
of
humanity
in
government
go
on
daily
gaining
upon
the
affections
of
his
people
there
is
not
any
privilege
so
dear
but
it
may
be
extorted
from
subjects
by
good
usage
and
by
keeping
them
alwayes
up
in
their
good
humour
i
will
not
say
what
one
prince
may
compass
within
his
own
time
or
what
a
second
though
surely
much
may
be
done
but
it
is
enough
if
a
great
and
durable
design
be
in
the
third
life
and
supposing
an
hereditary
succession
of
any
three
taking
up
still
where
the
other
left
and
dealing
still
in
that
fair
and
tender
way
of
management
it
is
impossible
but
that
even
without
reach
or
intention
upon
the
prince
part
all
should
fall
into
his
hand
and
in
so
short
a
time
the
very
memory
or
thoughts
of
any
such
thing
as
publick
liberty
would
as
it
were
by
consent
expire
and
be
for
ever
extinguish
so
that
whatever
the
power
of
the
magistrate
be
in
the
institution
it
is
much
safer
for
them
not
to
do
that
with
the
left
hand
which
they
may
do
with
the
right
nor
by
an
extraordinary
what
they
may
effect
by
the
ordinary
way
of
government
a
prince
that
goes
to
the
top
of
his
power
is
like
him
that
shall
go
to
the
bottom
of
his
treasure
and
as
for
the
common
people
he
has
this
to
say
yet
neither
do
they
want
the
use
of
reason
and
perhaps
their
aggregated
judgment
discerns
most
truly
the
errours
of
government
forasmuch
as
they
are
the
first
to
be
sure
that
smart
under
them
in
this
only
they
come
to
be
that
though
they
know
the
diseases
they
understand
not
the
remedies
and
though
good
patients
they
are
ill
physicians
the
magistrate
only
is
authorized
qualified
and
capable
to
make
a
just
and
effectual
reformation
and
especially
among
the
ecclesiasticks
for
in
all
experience
as
far
as
i
can
remember
they
have
never
been
forward
to
save
the
prince
that
labour
if
they
had
there
would
have
been
no
wickliffe
no
husse
no
luther
in
history
or
at
least
upon
so
notable
an
emergency
as
the
last
the
church
of
rome
would
then
in
the
council
of
trent
have
thought
of
rectifying
itself
in
good
earnest
that
it
might
have
recover
its
ancient
character
whereas
it
left
the
same
divisions
much
wider
and
the
christian
people
of
the

by

james

was
full
of
satirical
vivacity

was
considerably
learned
but
was
a
man
of
no
judgment
and
of
as
little
virtue
and
as
to
religion
rather
impious
after
he
had
for
some
years
entertained
the
nation
with
several
virulent
books
writ
with
much
life
he
was
attacked
by
the
liveliest
droll
of
the
age
who
writ
in
a
burlesque
strain

with
so
peculiar
and
entertaining
a
conduct
that
from
the
king
down
to
the
tradesman
his

were

last
years
in

house
of

marvell
last
ten
years
in
the
house
of
commons
were
made
miserable
by
the
passionate
conviction
that
there
existed
in
high
quarters
of
the
state
a
deep
dangerous
and
plot
to
subvert
the
protestant
faith
and
to
destroy
by
armed
force
parliamentary
government
in
england
marvell
was
not
the
victim
of
a
delusion
such
a
plot
plan
or
purpose
undoubtedly
existed
though
as
it
failed
it
is
now
easy
to
consider
the
alarm
it
created
to
have
been
exaggerated
marvell
was
of
all
public
men
then
living
the
one
most
deeply
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
our
free
constitution
its
checks
and
balances
jumped
with
his
humour
his
nature
was
without
any
taint
of
fanaticism
nor
was
he
anything
of
the
doctrinaire
he
was
neither
a
richard
baxter
nor
a
john
locke
he
had
none
of
the
pure
erastianism
of
selden
who
tells
us
in
his
inimitable
way
that
a
king
is
a
king
men
have
made
for
their
own
sakes
for
quietness
sake
just
as
in
a
family
one
man
is
appointed
to
buy
the
meat
and
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
spiritual
jurisdiction
all
is
civil
the
church
is
the
same
with
the
lord
mayor
the
pope
he
challenges
jurisdiction
over
all
the
bishops
they
pretend
to
it
as
well
as
he
the
presbyterians
they
would
have
it
to
themselves
but
over
whom
is
all
this
the
poor
layman
see
this
may
be
excellent
good
sense
but
it
does
not
represent
way
of
looking
at
things
he
thought
more
nobly
of
both
church
and
king
in
marvell
last
book
his
famous
pamphlet
account
of
the
growth
of
popery
and
arbitrary
government
in
england
printed
at
amsterdam
and
recommended
to
the
reading
of
all
english
which
made
a
prodigious
stir
and
it
is
sad
to
think
paved
the
way
for
the
popish
plot
marvell
sets
forth
his
view
of
our
constitution
in
language
as
lofty
as
it
is
precise
i
know
no
passage
in
any
of
our
institutional
writers
of
equal
merit
for
if
first
we
consider
the
state
the
kings
of
england
rule
not
upon
the
same
terms
with
those
of
our
neighbour
nations
who
having
by
force
or
by
address
usurped
that
due
share
which
their
people
had
in
the
government
are
now
for
some
ages
in
the
possession
of
an
arbitrary
power
which
yet
no
prescription
can
make
legal
and
exercise
it
over
their
persons
and
estates
in
a
most
tyrannical
manner
but
here
the
subjects
retain
their
proportion
in
the
legislature
the
very
meanest
commoner
of
england
is
represented
in
parliament
and
is
a
party
to
those
laws
by
which
the
prince
is
sworn
to
govern
himself
and
his
people
no
money
is
to
be
levied
but
by
the
common
consent
no
man
is
for
life
limb
goods
or
liberty
at
the
sovereign
discretion
but
we
have
the
same
right
modestly
understood
in
our
propriety
that
the
prince
hath
in
his
regality
and
in
all
cases
where
the
king
is
concerned
we
have
our
just
remedy
as
against
any
private
person
of
the
neighbourhood
in
the
courts
of
westminster
hall
or
in
the
high
court
of
parliament
his
very
prerogative
is
no
more
than
what
the
law
has
determined
his
broad
seal
which
is
the
legitimate
stamp
of
his
pleasure
yet
is
no
longer
currant
than
upon
the
trial
it
is
found
to
be
legal
he
can
not
commit
any
person
by
his
particular
warrant
he
can
not
himself
be
witness
in
any
cause
the
balance
of
publick
justice
being
so
delicate
that
not
the
hand
only
but
even
the
breath
of
the
prince
would
turn
the
scale
nothing
is
left
to
the
king
will
but
all
is
subjected
to
his
authority
by
which
means
it
follows
that
he
can
do
no
wrong
nor
can
he
receive
wrong
and
a
king
of
england
keeping
to
these
measures
may
without
arrogance
be
said
to
remain
the
onely
intelligent
ruler
over
a
rational
people
in
recompense
therefore
and
acknowledgment
of
so
good
a
government
under
his
influence
his
person
is
most
sacred
and
inviolable
and
whatsoever
excesses
are
committed
against
so
high
a
trust
nothing
of
them
is
imputed
to
him
as
being
free
from
the
necessity
or
temptation
but
his
ministers
only
are
accountable
for
all
and
must
answer
it
at
their
perils
he
hath
a
vast
revenue
constantly
arising
from
the
hearth
of
the
householder
the
sweat
of
the
labourer
the
rent
of
the
farmer
the
industry
of
the
merchant
and
consequently
out
of
the
estate
of
the
gentleman
a
large
competence
to
defray
the
ordinary
expense
of
the
crown
and
maintain
its
lustre
and
if
any
extraordinary
occasion
happen
or
be
but
with
any
probable
decency
pretended
the
whole
land
at
whatsoever
season
of
the
year
does
yield
him
a
plentiful
harvest
so
forward
are
his
people
affections
to
give
even
to
superfluity
that
a
forainer
or
englishman
that
hath
been
long
abroad
would
think
they
could
neither
will
nor
chuse
but
that
the
asking
of
a
supply
were
a
meer
formality
it
is
so
readily
granted
he
is
the
fountain
of
all
honours
and
has
moreover
the
distribution
of
so
many
profitable
offices
of
the
household
of
the
revenue
of
state
of
law
of
religion
of
the
navy
and
since
his
present
majestie
time
of
the
army
that
it
seems
as
if
the
nation
could
scarce
furnish
honest
men
enow
to
supply
all
those
imployments
so
that
the
kings
of
england
are
in
nothing
inferiour
to
other
princes
save
in
being
more
abridged
from
injuring
their
own
subjects
but
have
as
large
a
field
as
any
of
external
felicity
wherein
to
exercise
their
own
virtue
and
so
reward
and
incourage
it
in
others
in
short
there
is
nothing
that
comes
nearer
in
government
to
the
divine
perfection
than
where
the
monarch
as
with
us
injoys
a
capacity
of
doing
all
the
good
imaginable
to
mankind
under
a
disability
to
all
that
is
evil
this
was
the
constitution
which
marvell
whose
means
of
information
were
great
and
whose
curiosity
was
insatiable
believed
to
be
in
danger
no
wonder
he
was
agitated
the
politics
in
which
marvell
was
immersed
during
his
last
years
are
difficult
to
unravel
and
still
more
difficult
to
illuminate
for
they
had
their
dim
origin
in
the
secret
thoughts
and
wavering
purposes
of
the
king
charles
the
second
like
many
another
englishman
guiltless
of
stuart
blood
in
his
veins
was
mainly
governed
by
his
dislikes
his
pleasures
and
his
financial
necessities
to
suppose
as
some
hasty
moralisers
have
done
that
charles
cared
for
nothing
but
his
women
is
to
misread
his
character
he
had
many
qualifications
to
be
the
chief
magistrate
of
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
he
was
ever
alive
to
the
supreme
importance
of
english
trade
upon
the
high
seas
his
thoughts
were
often
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
indies
east
and
west
he
took
a
constant
though
not
always
an
honest
interest
in
the
navy
he
hated
holland
for
more
reasons
than
one
but
among
these
reasons
was
his
hatred
of
most
formidable
and
malicious
trade
competitor
he
also
disliked
her
arid
and
ugly
protestantism
and
blood
being
thicker
than
water
he
hated
holland
for
what
he
considered
her
shabby
treatment
of
his
youthful
nephew
whose
ultimate
destiny
was
happily
hidden
from
whitehall
among
charles
many
dislikes
must
be
included
the
anglican
bishops
who
had
prevented
him
from
keeping
his
word
and
foiled
his
purpose
of
a
wide
toleration
he
envied
his
brother
of
france
the
wide
culture
the
literature
and
art
of
catholicism
he
regretted
the
reformation
and
would
have
been
best
pleased
to
see
the
english
church
in
communion
with
rome
and
in
possession
of
anglican
liberties
akin
to
those
enjoyed
by
the
gallican
church
charles
was
also
jealous
of
louis
the
fourteenth
and
in
many
moods
had
no
mind
to
play
perpetually
a
second
fiddle
he
longed
for
a
navy
to
sweep
the
seas
for
an
army
strong
enough
to
keep
his
parliament
in
check
and
for
liberty
for
himself
and
for
all
those
of
his
subjects
who
were
so
minded
to
hear
mass
on
sundays
behind
and
above
and
always
surrounding
these
desires
and
dislikes
was
an
need
for
money
like
a
royal
becky
sharp
charles
might
have
found
it
easy
to
be
a
patriotic
king
on
five
millions
a
year
the
king
was
his
own
foreign
minister
and
being
what
he
was
and
swayed
by
the
considerations
i
have
imperfectly
described
his
foreign
policy
was
necessarily
tortuous
and
perplexing
as
ranke
says
charles
was
capable
of
proposing
offensive
alliances
to
the
three
neighbouring
powers
to
the
dutch
against
france
to
the
french
against
spain
and
holland
to
the
spaniards
against
france
to
the
detriment
of
holland
but
in
these
propositions
two
fundamental
views
always
recur
demands
for
money
and
assurance
of
commerce
for
england
charles
first
allowed
sir
william
temple
a
cool
prudent
man
to
form
in
a
famous
five
days
negotiation
the
defensive
treaty
with
holland
which
after
sweden
had
joined
it
became
known
as
the
triple
alliance
this
alliance
had
for
its
objects
mutual
promises
between
the
contracting
parties
to
come
to
each
other
assistance
by
sea
and
land
if
attacked
by
any
power
france
being
here
intended
to
force
spain
to
make
peace
with
france
on
the
terms
already
offered
and
to
compel
france
to
keep
those
terms
when
agreed
to
by
spain
the
triple
alliance
was
not
only
very
popular
in
england
but
was
good
diplomacy
for
it
was
quite
within
the
range
of
practical
politics
that
france
and
holland
might
have
combined
against
england
nor
could
it
easily
be
maintained
that
the
alliance
was
hostile
to
france
as
it
provided
that
spain
should
be
forced
to
accept
the
terms
france
had
already
proposed
what
wrecked
the
triple
alliance
and
prepared
the
way
for
the
secret
treaty
of
dover
was
the
impossibility
of
settling
those
religious
difficulties
which
despite
the
act
of
uniformity
were
more
rampant
than
ever
the
king
wanted
to
patch
up
peace
and
to
secure
some
working
plan
of
comprehension
or
composure
under
cover
of
which
the
catholic
religion
should
be
tolerated
and
presbyterianism
formally
recognised
but
king
though
he
was
he
could
not
get
his
way
the
church
and
the
house
of
commons
full
as
the
latter
was
of
his
pimps
and
pensioners
were
as
obstinate
as
mules
in
this
matter
of
toleration
they
would
neither
favour
papists
nor
dissenters
protested
against
indulgences
as
unconstitutional
and
clamoured
for
a
rigorous
administration
of
that
penal
legislation
against
nonconformists
which
they
had
purchased
with
so
many
and
such
lavish
supplies
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
penal
laws
were
very
fitfully
enforced
in
london
they
were
often
totally
disregarded
and
we
read
of
congregations
numbering
two
thousand
openly
attending
presbyterian
services
the
lord
mayor
for
the
time
being
took
his
orders
direct
from
the
king
what
was
charles
to
do
after
the
fall
of
clarendon
the
favourite
privy
councillors
called
the
cabal
because
the
initial
letters
of
their
names
formed
a
word
which
for
some
time
previously
had
been
in
common
use
represent
only
too
faithfully
the
confusion
and
corruption
of
the
times
clifford
was
a
zealous
roman
arlington
a
cautious
one
buckingham
a
and
mocker
friendly
to
france
and
on
good
terms

more
advanced
english
sectaries
ashley
made
no
pretence
to
be
a
christian
but
favoured
philosophic
toleration
whilst
lauderdale
one
of
the
most
learned
ministers
that
ever
sat
in
council
so
ranke
says
was
as
a
matter
of
profession
a
presbyterian
but
in
reality
a
man
wholly
and
slavishly
devoted
to
the
king
interests
and
prepared
at
any
moment
to
pour
into
the
kingdom
soldiers
from
scotland
to
purge
or
suppress
all
free
institutions
irritated
disgusted
thwarted
and

the

be
under
the
influence
of
his
accomplished
sister
the
beautiful
and
duchess
of
orleans
struck
up
to
use
marvell
own
words
an
invisible
league
with
france
the
negotiations
were
either
by
word
of
mouth
or
by
letters
which
have
been
burnt
lingard
in
his
history
gives
an
interesting
account
of
this
mysterious
transaction
two
things
are
apparent
as
the
objects
of
the
treaty
of
dover
the
dutch
republic
is
to
be
destroyed
and
the
cause
of
catholicism
in
england
is
to
be
promoted
and
maintained
it
was
this
latter
object
that
seems
most
to
have
excited
the
hopes
of
the
duchess
of
orleans
a
woman
hand
is
traceable
throughout
charles
promised
to
profess
himself
openly
a
roman
catholic
at
the
time
that
should
appear
to
be
most
expedient
and
subsequently
to
that
profession
he
was
to
join
with
louis
in
making
war
upon
the
dutch
republic
at
the
date
of
this
bewildering
agreement
it
was
high
treason
by
statute
even
to
that
charles
was
a
roman
catholic
in
case
the
king
public
conversion
should
lead
to
disturbances
louis
promised
an
aid
of
two
millions
of
and
an
armed
force
of
six
thousand
men
he
also
agreed
to
pay
the
whole
cost
of
the
dutch
war
and
to
contribute
thirty
to
the
english
fleet
holland
once
crushed
england
share
of
the
plunder
was
to
be
walcheren
sluys
and
cadsand
a
remarkable
conversion
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
that
either
charles
or
louis
were
quite
serious
over
this
part
of
the
business
yet
there
it
is
the
catholic
provisions
of
the
secret
treaty
of
dover
were
only
known
to
clifford
whose
soul
was
fired
by
them
and
to
arlington
who
did
not
share
the
confident
hopes
of
his
clifford
thought
there
were
thousands
of
englishmen
of
light
and
leading
among
the
english
catholics
who
would
be
both
willing
and
able
to
assume
the
burdens
of
the
state
and
to
rally
round
a
catholic
king
arlington
thought
otherwise
the
king
public
conversion
never
took
place
no
hint
was
given
of
any
such
impending
event
parliament
met
on
the
of
october
and
after
hearing
a
good
deal
about
the
triple
alliance
and
voting
large
sums
of
money
was
prorogued
in
april
and
did
not
meet
again
till
february
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
dutch
was
never
difficult
marvell
tells
us
how
it
was
done
a
sorry
yacht
but
bearing
the
english
jack
in
august
sails
into
the
midst
of
the
dutch
fleet
singles
out
the
admiral
shooting
twice
as
they
call
it
sharp
upon
him
which
must
sure
have
appeared
as
ridiculous
and
unnatural
as
for
a
lark
to
dare
the
hobby
the
dutch
admiral
asking
why
was
told
because
he
and
his
whole
fleet
had
failed
to
strike
sail
to
his
small
craft
the
dutch
commander
then
civilly
excused
it
as
a
matter
of
the
first
instance
and
in
which
he
could
have
no
instruction
therefore
proper
to
be
referred
to
their
masters
and
so
they
parted
the
yacht
having
thus
acquitted
itself
returned
fraught
with
the
quarrel
she
was
sent
for
surinam
was
a
perpetual
some
offence
against
the
law
of
nations
was
always
happening
there
a
third
matter
very
full
of
gunpowder
was
made
great
use
of
by
the
promoters
of
the
war
already
agreed
upon
a
picture
had
been
hung
at
dort
representing
de
witt
sailing
up
the
medway
very
much
in
the
manner
described
in
marvell
poem
medals
also
had
been
struck
and
distributed
in
commemoration
of
the
same
event
war
was
declared
against
holland
by
england
and
france
in
march
the
declaration
of
war
was
preceded
by
the
declaration
of
indulgence
whereby
wrote
marvell
all
the
penal
laws
against
papists
for
which
former
parliaments
had
given
so
many
supplies
and
against
nonconformists
for
which
this
parliament
had
paid
more
largely
were
at
one
instant
suspended
in
order
to
defraud
the
nation
of
all
that
religion
which
they
had
so
dearly
purchased
and
for
which
they
ought
at
least
the
bargain
being
broke
to
have
been
reimbursed
the
unconstitutional
suspension
of
bad
laws
put
lovers
of
freedom
in
a
predicament
marvell
was
what
he
calls
a
composure
that
is
a
comprehension
man
in
the
of
he
sorrowfully
admits
that
it
is
the
gravest
reproach
of
human
wisdom
that
no
man
seems
able
or
willing
to
find
out
the
due
temper
of
government
in
divine
matters
insomuch
that
it
is
no
great
adventure
to
say
that
the
world
was
better
ordered
under
the
ancient
monarchies
and
commonwealths
that
the
number
of
virtuous
men
was
then
greater
and
that
the
christians
found
fairer
quarter
under
those
than
among
themselves
nor
hath
there
any
advantage
accrued
unto
mankind
from
that
most
perfect
and
practical
model
of
humane
society
except
the
speculation
of
a
better
way
to
future
happiness
concerning
which
the
very
guides
disagree
and
of
those
few
that
follow
it
will
suffer
no
man
to
pass
without
paying
at
their
turnpikes
vol

p
the
french
alliance
made
the
war
though
with
holland
unpopular
writers
had
to
be
hired
to
defend
it
france
was
supposed
to
look
on
with
much
composure
as
her
two
maritime
competitors
battered
each
other
fleets
at
sea
the
honours
were
divided
between
the
dutch
and
the
english

louis
had
it
all
his
own
way
besides
rumours
got
abroad
of
an
uncomfortable
plot
to
restore
popery
jesuits
seemed
to
abound
roman
catholics
asserted
themselves
the
laws
being
suspended
an
army
was
collected
at
blackheath
the
treasury
was
closed
charles
had
been
badly
bled
by
the
goldsmiths
or
bankers
who
had
charged
him
per
cent
but
in
commercial
centres
acts
of
bankruptcy
are
seldom
popular
and
though
the
bankers
were
compelled
to
be
content
with
per
the
closing
of
the
treasury
brought
ruin
into
many
homes
when
parliament
met
in
february
its
temper
was
bad
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
declaration
of
indulgence
and
though
the
king
had
told
them
in
the
round
set
terms
he
could
so
well
command
that
he
was
resolved
to
stick
to
his
declaration
he
had
to
give
way
and
to
see
the
house
busy
itself
with
a
test
bill
that
drove
all
roman
catholics
from
the
duke
of
york
who
had
gone
over
in
the
spring
of
downwards
out
of
office
the
only
effect
of
charles
policy
was
to
mitigate
the
hostility
of
the
house
of
commons
to
protestant
dissenters
and
to
drive
it
to
concentrate
its
jealousy
upon
the
catholics
any
lurking
idea
of
the
king
declaring
himself
a
romanist
had
to
be
abandoned
his
hatred
of
parliament
increased
he
lost
all
sense
of
shame
and
frankly
became
a
pensioner
of
france
in
he
concluded
a
second
secret
treaty
whereby
both
louis
and
himself
bound
themselves
to
enter
into
no
engagements
with
other
powers
without
consent
and
in
case
of
rebellion
within
their
realms
to
come
to
each
other
assistance
louis
agreed
to
make
charles
an
annual
allowance
of
a
hundred
thousand
afterwards
increased
to
two
hundred
thousand
this
money
was
largely
spent
in
bribing
the
house
of
commons
the
french
ambassador
was
allowed
an
extra
grant
of
a
thousand
crowns
a
month
to
keep
a
table
for
hungry
legislators
did
not
marvell
do
well
to
be
angry
some
of
marvell
letters
belonging
to
this
gloomy
period
are
full
of
interest
william
ramsden
dear
will
i
need
not
tell
you
i
am
always
thinking
of
you
all
that
has
happened
which
is
remarkable
since
i
wrote
is
as
follows
the
lieutenancy
of
london
chiefly
sterlin
the
mayor
and
sir
robinson
alarmed
the
king
continually
with
the
conventicles
there
so
the
king
sent
them
strict
and
large
powers
the
duke
of
york
every
sunday
would
come
over
thence
to
look
to
the
peace
to
say
truth
they
met
in
numerous
open
assemblys
without
any
dread
of
government
but
the
train
bands
in
the
city
and
soldiery
in
southwark
and
suburbs
harassed
and
abused
them
continually
they
wounded
many
and
killed
some
quakers
especially
while
they
took
all
patiently
hence
arose
two
things
of
great
remark
the
lieutenancy
having
got
orders
to
their
mind
pick
out
hays
and
jekill
the
innocentist
of
the
whole
party
to
show
their
power
on
they
offer
them
illegal
bonds
of
five
thousand
pounds
a
man
which
if
they
would
not
enter
into
they
must
go
to
prison
so
they
were
committed
and
at
last
but
it
is
a
very
long
story
got
free
some
friends
engaged
for
them
the
other
was
the
tryal
of
pen
and
mead
quakers
at
the
old
baily
the
jury
not
finding
them
guilty
as
the
recorder
and
mayor
would
have
had
them
they
were
kept
without
meat
or
drink
some
three
days
till
almost
starved
but
would
not
alter
their
verdict
so
fined
and
imprisoned
there
is
a
book
out
which
relates
all
the
passages
which
were
very
pertinent
of
the
prisoners
but
prodigiously
barbarous
by
the
mayor
and
recorder
the
recorder
among
the
rest
commended
the
spanish
inquisition
saying
it
would
never
be
well
till
we
had
something
like
it
the
king
had
occasion
for
sixty
thousand
pounds
sent
to
borrow
it
of
the
city
sterlin
robinson
and
all
the
rest
of
that
faction
were
at
it
many
a
week
and
could
not
get
above
ten
thousand
the
fanatics
under
persecution
served
his
majesty
the
other
party
both
in
court
and
city
would
have
prevented
it
but
the
king
protested
mony
would
be
acceptable
so
the
king
patched
up
out
of
the
chamber
and
other
ways
twenty
thousand
pounds
the
fanatics
of
all
sorts
forty
thousand
the
king
though
against
many
of
his
council
would
have
the
parliament
sit
this
of
october
he
and
the
keeper
spoke
of
nothing
but
to
have
mony
some
one
million
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
to
pay
off
the
debts
at
interest
and
eight
hundred
thousand
for
a
brave
navy
next
spring
both
speeches
forbid
to
be
printed
for
the
king
said
very
little
and
the
keeper
it
was
thought
too
much
in
his
politic
simple
discourse
of
foreign
affairs
the
house
was
thin
and
obsequious
they
voted
at
first
they
would
supply
him
according
to
his
occasions
as
it
was
remarked
but
few
affirmatives
rather
a
silence
as
of
men
ashamed
and
unwilling
sir
howard
seymour
temple
car
and
hollis
openly
took
leave
of
their
former
party
and
fell
to
head
the
king
busyness
there
is
like
to
be
a
terrible
act
of
conventicles
the
prince
of
orange
here
is
much
made
of
the
king
owes
him
a
great
deal
of
mony

paper

the
trial
of
william
penn
and
william
mead
at
the
old
bailey
for
a
tumultuous
assembly
written
by
themselves
may
be
read
in
the
vol
vi
the
trial
was
the
occasion
of
penn
famous
remark
to
the
recorder
of
london
who
driven
wellnigh
distracted
by
dialectics
exclaimed
if
i
should
suffer
you
to
ask
questions
till
morning
you
would
never
be
the
wiser
that
replied
penn
would
be
according
as
the
answers
are
william
ramsden
undated
dear
will
the
parliament
are
still
proceeding
but
not
much
advanced
on
their
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
bill
on
money
at
interest
offices
and
lands
and
the
excise
bills
valued
at
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
the
first
for
the
navy
which
scarce
will
be
set
out
the
last
to
be
for
paying
one
million
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
which
the
king
owes
at
interest
and
perhaps
may
be
given
for
four
five
or
six
years
as
the
house
chances
to
be
in
humour
but
an
accident
happened
which
liked
to
have
spoiled
all
sir
john
coventry
having
moved
for
an
imposition
on
the
playhouses
sir
john
berkenhead
to
excuse
them
sayed
they
had
been
of
great
service
to
the
king
upon
which
sir
john
coventry
desired
that
gentleman
to
explain
whether
he
meant
the
men
or
the
women
players
hereupon
it
is
imagined
that
the
house
adjourning
from
tuesday
before
till
thursday
after
on
the
very
tuesday
night
of
the
adjournment
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
troop
and
some
few
foot
layed
in
wait
from
ten
at
night
till
two
in
the
morning
by
and
as
he
returned
from
the
cock
where
he
supped
to
his
own
house
they
threw
him
down
and
with
a
knife
cut
off
almost
the
end
of
his
nose
but
company
coming
made
them
fearful
to
finish
it
so
they
marched
off
sir
thomas
sands
lieutenant
of
the
troop
commanded
the
party
and
the
earl
of
inchequin
son
was
a
principal
actor
the
court
hereupon
sometimes
thought
to
carry
it
with
a
high
hand
and
question
sir
john
for
his
words
and
maintain
the
action
sometimes
they
flagged
in
their
counsels
however
the
king
commanded
sir
thomas
clarges
and
sir
pultney
to
release
wroth
and
lake
who
were
two
of
the
actors
and
taken
but
the
night
before
the
house
met
they
surrendered
them
again
the
house
being
but
sullen
the
next
day
the
court
did
not
oppose
adjourning
for
some
days
longer
till
it
was
filled
then
the
house
went
upon
coventry
busyness
and
voted
that
they
would
go
upon
nothing
else
whatever
till
they
had
passed
a
bill
as
they
did
for
sands
parry
and
reeves
to
come
in
by
the
sixteenth
of
february
or
else
be
condemned
and
never
to
be
pardoned
but
by
an
express
act
of
parliament
and
their
names
therein
inserted
for
fear
of
being
pardoned
in
some
general
act
of
grace
farther
of
all
such
actions
for
the
future
on
any
man
felony
without
clergy
and
who
shall
otherwise
strike
or
wound
any
during
his
attendance
or
going
or
coming
imprisonment
for
a
year
treble
damages
and
incapacity
this
bill
having
in
some
few
days
been
dispatched
to
the
lords
the
house
has
since
gone
on
in
grand
committee
upon
the
first
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
bill
but
are
not
yet
half
way
but
now
the
lords
instead
of
the
sixteenth
of
february
put
days
after
the
king
royal
assent
and
that
registered
in
their
journal
they
disagree
in
several
other
things
but
adhere
in
that
first
which
is
most
material
adhere
in
this
place
signifies
not
to
be
retracted
and
excludes
a
free
conference
so
that
this
week
the
houses
will
be
in
danger
of
splitting
without
much
wisdom
or
force
for
considering
that
sir
thomas
sands
was
the
very
person
sent
to
clarges
and
pultney
that
was
concealed
in
the
duke
of
monmouth
lodgings
that
wroth
and
lake
were
bayled
at
the
sessions
by
order
from
attorney
and
that
all
persons
and
things
are
perfectly
discovered
that
act
will
not
be
passed
without
great
consequence

you

william
ramsden
undated
dear
will
i
think
i
have
not
told
you
that
on
our
bill
of
subsidy
the
lord
lucas
made
a
fervent
bold
speech
against
our
prodigality
in
giving
and
the
weak
looseness
of
the
government
the
king
being
present
and
the
lord
clare
another
to
persuade
the
king
that
he
ought
not
to
be
present
but
all
this
had
little
encouragement
not
being
seconded
copys
going
about
everywhere
one
of
them
was
brought
into
the
lords
house
and
lord
lucas
was
asked
whether
it
was
his
he
sayd
part
was
and
part
was
not
thereupon
they
took
advantage
and
sayed
it
was
a
libel
even
against
lucas
himself
on
this
they
voted
it
a
libel
and
to
be
burned
by
the
hangman
which
was
done
but
the
sport
was
the
hangman
burned
the
lords
order
with
it
i
take
the
last
quarrel
betwixt
us
and
the
lords
to
be
as
the
ashes
of
that
speech
doubtless
you
have
heard
before
this
time
how
monmouth
albemarle
dunbane
and
seven
or
eight
gentlemen
fought
with
the
watch
and
killed
a
poor
bedle
they
have
all
got
their
pardons
for
monmouth
sake
but
it
is
an
act
of
great
scandal
the
king
of
france
is
at
dunkirke
we
have
no
fleet
out
though
we
gave
the
subsidy
bill
valued
at
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
for
that
purpose
i
believe
indeed
he
will
attempt
nothing
on
us
but
leave
us
to
dy
a
natural
death
for
indeed
never
had
poor
nation
so
many
complicated
mortal
incurable
diseases
you
know
the
dutchess
of
york
is
dead
all
gave
her
for
a
papist
i
think
it
will
be
my
lot
to
go
on
an
honest
fair
employment
into
ireland
some
have
smelt
the
court
of
rome
at
that
distance
there
i
hope
i
shall
be
out
of
the
smell
of
our
yours
etc
a
friend
in
dear
sir
i
have
yours
of
the
of
october
which
was
in
all
respects
most
welcome
to
me
except
when
i
considered
that
to
write
it
you
endured
some
pain
for
you
say
your
hand
is
not
yet
recovered
if
i
could
say
any
thing
to
you
towards
the
advancement
of
your
affairs
i
could
with
a
better
conscience
admit
you
should
spend
so
much
of
your
precious
time
as
you
do
upon
me
but
you
know
how
far
those
things
are
out
of
my
road
tho
otherwise
most
desirous
in
all
things
to
be
serviceable
to
you
god
good
providence
which
hath
through
so
dangerous
a
disease
and
so
many
difficultys
preserved
and
restored
you
will
i
doubt
not
conduct
you
to
a
prosperous
issue
and
the
perfection
of
your
so
laudable
undertakings
and
under
that
your
own
good
genius
in
conjunction
with
your
brother
here
will
i
hope
though
at
the
distance
of
england
and
persia
in
good
time
operate
extraordinary
effects
for
the
magnetism
of
two
souls
rightly
touched
works
beyond
all
natural
limits
and
it
would
be
indeed
too
unequal
if
good
nature
should
not
have
at
least
as
large
a
sphere
of
activity
as
malice
envy
and
detraction
which
are
it
seems
part
of
the
returns
from
gombroon
and
surat
all
i
can
say
to
you
in
that
matter
is
that
you
must
seeing
it
will
not
be
better
stand
upon
your
guard
for
in
this
world
a
good
cause
signifys
little
unless
it
be
as
well
defended
a
man
may
starve
at
the
feast
of
good
conscience

after
he
had
instructed
me
all
he
could
told
me
i
remember
there
was
yet
one
secret
against
which
there
was
no
defence
and
that
was
to
give
the
first
blow
i
know
your
maxim
festinat
ditescere
non
erit
indeed
while
you
preserve
that
mind
you
will
have
the
blessing
both
of
god
and
man
in
general
i
perceive
and
am
very
glad
of
it
that
by
your
good
management
your
friends
here
get
ground
and
the
flint
in
your
adversarys
hearts
begins
to
be
mollifyed
now
after
my
usual
method
leaving
to
others
what
relates
to
busyness
i
address
myself
which
is
all
i
am
good
for
to
be
your
gazettier
i
am
sorry
to
perceive
that
mine
by
the
armenian
miscarryed
tho
there
was
nothing
material
in
it
the
thoughts
of
friends
are
too
valuable
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
stranger
i
wrote
the
last
february
at
large
and
wish
it
a
better
passage
in
this
perhaps
i
may
interfere
something
with
that
chusing
rather
to
repeat
than
omit
the
king
having
upon
pretence
of
the
great
preparations
of
his
neighbours
demanded
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
for
his
navy
though
in
conclusion
he
hath
not
set
out
any
and
that
the
parliament
should
pay
his
debts
which
the
ministers
would
never
particularize
to
the
house
of
commons
our
house
gave
several
bills
you
see
how
far
things
were
stretched
though
beyond
reason
there
being
no
satisfaction
how
those
debts
were
contracted
and
all
men
foreseeing
that
what
was
given
would
not
be
applyed
to
discharge
the
debts
which
i
hear
are
at
this
day
risen
to
four
millions
but
diverted
as
formerly
nevertheless
such
was
the
number
of
the
constant
courtiers
increased
by
the
apostate
patriots
who
were
bought
off
for
that
turn
some
at
six
others
ten
one
at
fifteen
thousand
pounds
in
money
besides
what
offices
lands
and
reversions
to
others

it
is
a
mercy
they
gave
not
away
the
whole
land
and
liberty
of
england
the
earl

a
very
bold
and
rational
harangue
the

present
against
the

sitting
among
the
lords
contrary
to
former
precedents
during
their
debates
but
he
was
not
seconded
the

this
april
prorogued

william
ramsden
dear
will
affairs
begin
to
alter
and
men
talk
of
a
peace
with
holland
and
taking
them
into
our
protection
and
it
is
my
opinion
it
will
be
before
michaelmas
for
some
reasons
not
fit
to
write
we
can
not
have
a
peace
with
france
and
holland
both
the
dutch
are
now
brought
very
low
but
amsterdam
and
some
other
provinces
are
resolved
to
stand
out
till
the
last
is
stabbed
and
dead
of
his
wounds
it
was
at
twelve
a
clock
at
night
the
of
this
month
as
he
came
from
the
council
at
the
hague
four
men
wounded
him
with
their
swords
but
his
own
letter
next
morning
to
the
states
says
nothing
appeared
mortal
the
whole
province
of
utrecht
is
yielding
up
no
man
can
conceive
the
condition
of
the
state
of
holland
in
this
juncture
unless
he
can
at
the
same
time
conceive
an
earthquake
an
hurricane
and
the
deluge
france
is
potent
and
subtle
here
have
been
several
fires
of
late
one
at
catherine
which
burned
about
six
score
or
two
hundred
houses
and
some
seven
or
eight
ships
another
in
another
in
crichet
fryars
another
in
southwark
and
some
elsewhere
you
may
be
sure
all
the
old
talk
is
hereupon
revived
there
was
the
other
day
though
not
on
this
occasion
a
severe
proclamation
issued
out
against
all
who
shall
vent
false
news
or
discourse
ill
concerning
affairs
of
state
so
that
in
writing
to
you
i
run
the
risque
of
making
a
breech
in
the
yours
etc
the
following
letter
deals
with
another
matter
of
human
concern
than
politics
for
it
seeks
to
condole
with
a
father
who
has
lost
an
only
son
sir
john
undated
honoured
sir
i
have
not
that
vanity
to
believe
if
you
weigh
your
late
loss
by
the
common
ballance
that
any
thing
i
can
write
to
you
should
lighten
your
resentments
nor
if
you
measure
things
by
the
rules
of
christianity
do
i
think
it
needful
to
comfort
you
in
your
duty
and
your
son
happyness
only
having
a
great
esteem
and
affection
for
you
and
the
grateful
memory
of
him
that
is
departed
being
still
green
and
fresh
upon
my
spirit
i
can
not
forbear
to
inquire
how
you
have
stood
the
second
shock
at
your
sad
meeting
of
friends
in
the
country
i
know
that
the
very
sight
of
those
who
have
been
witnesses
of
our
better
fortune
doth
but
serve
to
reinforce
a
calamity
i
know
the
contagion
of
grief
and
infection
of
tears
and
especially
when
it
runs
in
a
blood
and
i
myself
could
sooner
imitate
than
blame
those
innocent
relentings
of
nature
so
that
they
spring
from
tenderness
only
and
humanity
not
from
an
implacable
sorrow
the
tears
of
a
family
may
flow
together
like
those
little
drops
that
compact
the
rainbow
and
if
they
be
placed
with
the
same
advantage
towards
heaven
as
those
are
to
the
sun
they
too
have
their
splendour
and
like
that
bow
while
they
unbend
into
seasonable
showers
yet
they
promise
that
there
shall
not
be
a
second
flood
but
the
dissoluteness
of
grief
the
prodigality
of
sorrow
is
neither
to
be
indulged
in
a
man
self
nor
complyed
with
in
others
if
that
were
allowable
in
these
cases
eli
was
the
readyest
way
and
highest
compliment
of
mourning
who
fell
back
from
his
seat
and
broke
his
neck
but
neither
does
that
precedent
hold
for
though
he
had
been
chancellor
and
in
effect
king
of
israel
for
so
many
years
and
such
men
value
as
themselves
their
losses
at
an
higher
rate
than
others
yet
when
he
heard
that
israel
was
overcome
that
his
two
sons
hophni
and
phineas
were
slain
in
one
day
and
saw
himself
so
without
hope
of
issue
and
which
imbittered
it
farther
without
succession
to
the
government
yet
he
fell
not
till
the
news
that
the
ark
of
god
was
taken
i
pray
god
that
we
may
never
have
the
same
parallel
perfected
in
our
publick
concernments
then
we
shall
need
all
the
strength
of
grace
and
nature
to
support
us
but
on
a
private
loss
and
sweetened
with
so
many
circumstances
as
yours
to
be
impatient
to
be
uncomfortable
would
be
to
dispute
with
god
though
an
only
son
be
inestimable
yet
it
is
like
jonah
sin
to
be
angry
at
god
for
the
withering
of
his
shadow
zipporah
though
the
delay
had
almost
cost
her
husband
his
life
yet
when
he
did
but
circumcise
her
son
in
a
womanish
peevishness
reproached
moses
as
a
bloody
husband
but
if
god
take
the
son
himself
but
spare
the
father
shall
we
say
that
he
is
a
bloody
god
he
that
gave
his
own
son
may
he
not
take
ours
it
is
pride
that
makes
a
rebel
and
nothing
but
the
of
ourselves
and
our
own
things
that
raises
us
against
divine
providence
whereas
abraham
obedience
was
better
than
sacrifice
and
if
god
please
to
accept
both
it
is
indeed
a
farther
tryal
but
a
greater
honour
i
could
say
over
upon
this
beaten
occasion
most
of
those
lessons
of
morality
and
religion
which
have
been
so
often
repeated
and
are
as
soon
forgotten
we
abound
with
precept
but
we
want
examples
you
sir
that
have
all
these
things
in
your
memory
and
the
clearness
of
whose
judgment
is
not
to
be
obscured
by
any
greater
interposition
should
be
exemplary
to
others
in
your
own
practice
is
true
it
is
an
hard
task
to
learn
and
teach
at
the
same
time
and
where
yourselves
are
the
experiment
it
is
as
if
a
man
should
dissect
his
own
body
and
read
the
anatomy
lecture
but
i
will
not
heighten
the
difficulty
while
i
advise
the
attempt
only
as
in
difficult
things
you
would
do
well
to
make
use
of
all
that
may
strengthen
and
assist
you
the
word
of
god
the
society
of
good
men
and
the
books
of
the
ancients
there
is
one
way
more
which
is
by
diversion
business
and
activity
which
are
also
necessary
to
be
used
in
their
season
but
i
myself
who
live
to
so
little
purpose
can
have
little
authority
or
ability
to
advise
you
in
it
who
are
a
person
that
are
and
may
be
much
more
so
generally
useful
all
that
i
have
been
able
to
do
since
hath
been
to
write
this
sorry
elogy
of
your
son
which
if
it
be
as
good
as
i
could
wish
it
is
as
yet
no
indecent
employment
however
i
know
you
will
take
any
thing
kindly
from
your
very
affectionate
friend
and
most
humble
servant
milton
died
on
the
of
november
marvell
remained
among
the
poet
intimate
friends
until
the
end
and
intended
to
write
his
life
it
is
idle
to
mourn
the
loss
of
an
unwritten
book
but
marvell
life
of
milton
would
have
been
a
treasure
when
parliament
met
on
the
of
april
members
found
in
their
places
a
from
the
throne
they
the
hand
that
had
penned
it
it
was
a
daring
production
and
ran
as
follows
majesty
most
gracious
speech
to
both
houses
of
my
lords
and
gentlemen
i
told
you
at
our
last
meeting
the
winter
was
the
fittest
time
for
business
and
truly
i
thought
so
till
my
lord
treasurer
assured
me
the
spring
was
the
best
season
for
sallads
and
subsidies
i
hope
therefore
that
april
will
not
prove
so
unnatural
a
month
as
not
to
afford
some
kind
showers
on
my
parched
exchequer
which
gapes
for
want
of
them
some
of
you
perhaps
will
think
it
dangerous
to
make
me
too
rich
but
i
do
not
fear
it
for
i
promise
you
faithfully
whatever
you
give
me
i
will
always
want
and
although
in
other
things
my
word
may
be
thought
a
slender
authority
yet
in
that
you
may
rely
on
me
i
will
never
break
it
my
lords
and
gentlemen
i
can
bear
my
straits
with
patience
but
my
lord
treasurer
does
protest
to
me
that
the
revenue
as
it
now
stands
will
not
serve
him
and
me
too
one
of
us
must
pinch
for
it
if
you
do
not
help
me
i
must
speak
freely
to
you
i
am
under
bad
circumstances
for
besides
my
harlots
in
service
my
reformado
concubines
lye
heavy
upon
me
i
have
a
passable
good
estate
i
confess
but
i
have
a
great
charge
upon
here
my
lord
treasurer
can
tell
that
all
the
money
designed
for
next
summer
guards
must
of
necessity
be
applyed
to
the
next
cradles
and
what
shall
we
do
for
ships
then
i
hint
this
only
to
you
it
being
your
busyness
not
mine
i
know
by
experience
i
can
live
without
ships
i
lived
ten
years
abroad
without
and
never
had
my
health
better
in
my
life
but
how
you
will
be
without
i
leave
to
yourselves
to
judge
and
therefore
hint
this
only
by
the
bye
i
do
not
insist
upon
it
there
another
thing
i
must
press
more
earnestly
and
that
is
this
it
seems
a
good
part
of
my
revenue
will
expire
in
two
or
three
years
except
you
will
be
pleased
to
continue
it
i
have
to
say
for
pray
why
did
you
give
me
so
much
as
you
have
done
unless
you
resolve
to
give
on
as
fast
as
i
call
for
it
the
nation
hates
you
already
for
giving
so
much
and
i
hate
you
too
if
you
do
not
give
me
more
so
that
if
you
stick
not
to
me
you
must
not
have
a
friend
in
england
on
the
other
hand
if
you
will
give
me
the
revenue
i
desire
i
shall
be
able
to
do
those
things
for
your
religion
and
liberty
that
i
have
had
long
in
my
thoughts
but
can
not
effect
them
without
a
little
more
money
to
carry
me
through
therefore
look
to
and
take
notice
that
if
you
do
not
make
me
rich
enough
to
undo
you
it
shall
lie
at
your
doors
for
my
part
i
wash
my
hands
on
but
that
i
may
gain
your
good
opinion
the
best
way
is
to
acquaint
you
what
i
have
done
to
deserve
it
out
of
my
royal
care
for
your
religion
and
your
property
for
the
first
my
proclamation
is
a
true
picture
of
my
mind
he
that
can
not
as
in
a
glass
see
my
zeal
for
the
church
of
england
does
not
deserve
any
farther
satisfaction
for
i
declare
him
wilful
abominable
and
not
good
some
may
perhaps
be
startled
and
cry
how
comes
this
sudden
change
to
which
i
answer
i
am
a
changling
and
that
sufficient
i
think
but
to
convince
men
farther
that
i
mean
what
i
say
there
are
these
arguments
first
i
tell
you
so
and
you
know
i
never
break
my
word
secondly
my
lord
treasurer
says
so
and
he
never
told
a
lye
in
his
life
thirdly
my
lord
lauderdale
will
undertake
it
for
me
and
i
should
be
loath
by
any
act
of
mine
he
should
forfeit
the
credit
he
has
with
you
if
you
desire
more
instances
of
my
zeal
i
have
them
for
you
for
example
i
have
converted
my
natural
sons
from
popery
and
i
may
say
without
vanity
it
was
my
own
work
so
much
the
more
peculiarly
mine
than
the
begetting
them
do
one
heart
good
to
hear
how
prettily
george
can
read
already
in
the
psalter
they
are
all
fine
children
god
bless
and
so
like
me
in
their
understandings
but
as
i
was
saying
i
have
to
please
you
given
a
pension
to
your
favourite
my
lord
lauderdale
not
so
much
that
i
thought
he
wanted
it
as
that
you
would
take
it
kindly
i
have
made
carwell
dutchess
of
portsmouth
and
marryed
her
sister
to
the
earl
of
pembroke
i
have
at
my
brother
request
sent
my
lord
inchequin
into
barbary
to
settle
the
protestant
religion
among
the
moors
and
an
english
interest
at
tangier
i
have
made
crew
bishop
of
durham
and
at
the
first
word
of
my
lady
portsmouth
prideaux
bishop
of
chichester
i
know
not
for
my
part
what
factious
men
would
have
but
this
i
am
sure
of
my
predecessors
never
did
anything
like
this
to
gain
the
good
will
of
their
subjects
so
much
for
your
religion
and
now
for
your
property
my
behaviour
to
the
bankers
is
a
publick
instance
and
the
proceedings
between
hyde
and
sutton
for
private
ones
are
such
convincing
evidences
that
it
will
be
needless
to
say
any
more
to
i
must
now
acquaint
you
that
by
my
lord
treasurer
advice
i
have
made
a
considerable
retrenchment
upon
my
expenses
in
candles
and
charcoal
and
do
not
intend
to
stop
there
but
will
with
your
help
look
into
the
late
embezzlements
of
my
and
of
which
by
the
way
upon
my
conscience
neither
my
lord
treasurer
nor
my
lord
lauderdale
are
guilty
i
tell
you
my
opinion
but
if
you
should
find
them
dabling
in
that
busyness
i
tell
you
plainly
i
leave
to
you
for
i
would
have
the
world
to
know
i
am
not
a
man
to
be
cheated
my
lords
and
gentlemen
i
desire
you
to
believe
me
as
you
have
found
me
and
i
do
solemnly
promise
you
that
whatsoever
you
give
me
shall
be
specially
managed
with
the
same
conduct
trust
sincerity
and
prudence
that
i
have
ever
practised
since
my
happy
restoration
mock
king
speeches
have
often
been
made
but
this
is
the
first
and
i
think
still
the
best
of
them
all
there
was
no
shaking
off
religion
from
the
debates
of
those
days
a
new
oaths
bill
suddenly
appeared
in
the
house
of
lords
where
it
gave
rise
to
one
of
the
greatest
debates
that
assembly
has
ever
witnessed
lasting
seventeen
days
the
bishops
were
baited
by
the
peers
with
great
spirit
and
the
report
of
the
proceedings
may
still
be
read
with
gusto
marvell
in
his
of
thus
describes
what
happened
while
these
things
were
upon
the
anvil
the
of
november
was
come
for
the
parliament
sitting
but
that
was
put
off
till
the
of
april
and
in
the
meantime
which
fell
out
most
opportune
for
the
conspirators
these
counsels
were
matured
and
something
further
to
be
contrived
that
was
yet
wanting
the
parliament
accordingly
meeting
and
the
house
of
lords
as
well
as
that
of
the
commons
being
in
deliberation
of
several
wholesome
bills
such
as
the
present
state
of
the
nation
required
the
great
design
came
out
in
a
bill
unexpectedly
offered
one
morning
in
the
house
of
lords
whereby
all
such
as
injoyed
any
beneficial
office
or
imployment
ecclesiastical
civil
or
military
to
which
was
added
privy
counsellors
justices
of
the
peace
and
members
of
parliament
were
under
a
penalty
to
take
the
oath
and
make
the
declaration
and
abhorrence
insuring
do
declare
that
it
is
not
lawful
upon
any
pretence
whatsoever
to
take
up
arms
against
the
king
and
that
i
do
abhor
that
traiterous
position
of
taking
arms
by
his
authority
against
his
person
or
against
those
that
are
commissioned
by
him
in
pursuance
of
such
commission
and
i
do
swear
that
i
will
not
at
any
time
indeavour
the
alteration
of
the
government
either
in
church
or
state
so
help
me
god
this
same
oath
had
been
brought
into
the
house
of
commons
in
the
plague
year
at
oxford
to
have
been
imposed
upon
the
nation
but
there
by
the
assistance
of
those
very
same
persons
that
now
introduce
it
was
thrown
out
for
fear
of
a
general
infection
of
the
vitals
of
this
kingdom
and
though
it
passed
then
in
a
particular
bill
known
by
the
name
of
the
five
mile
act
because
it
only
concerned
the
preachers
yet
even
in
that
it
was
thoroughly
opposed
by
the
late
earl
of
southampton
whose
judgement
might
well
have
been
reckoned
for
the
standard
of
prudence
and
loyalty
of
the
proposed
oath
marvell
says
no
conveyancer
could
ever
in
more
compendious
or
binding
terms
have
drawn
a
dissettlement
of
the
whole
birthright
of
england
this
was
no
mere
legal
quibbling
these
things
are
no
niceties
or
remote
considerations
though
in
making
of
laws
and
which
must
come
afterwards
under
construction
of
judges
bene
all
cases
are
to
be
put
and
imagined
but
there
being
an
act
in
scotland
for
men
to
march
into
england
upon
call
and
so
great
a
body
of
english
soldiery
in
france
within
summons
besides
what
foreigners
may
be
obliged
by
treaty
to
furnish
and
it
being
so
fresh
in
memory
what
sort
of
persons
had
lately
been
in
commission
among
us
to
which
add
the
many
books
then
printed
by
license
writ
some
by
men
of
the
black
one
of
the
green
cloth
wherein
the
absoluteness
of
the
english
monarchy
is
against
all
law
asserted
all
these
considerations
put
together
were
sufficient
to
make
any
honest
and
well
advised
man
to
conceive
indeed
that
upon
the
passing
of
this
oath
and
declaration
the
whole
sum
of
affairs
depended
it
grew
therefore
to
the
greatest
contest
that
has
perhaps
ever
been
in
parliament
wherein
those
lords
that
were
against
this
oath
being
assured
of
their
own
loyalty
and
merit
stood
up
now
for
the
english
liberties
with
the
same
genius
virtue
and
courage
that
their
noble
ancestors
had
formerly
defended
the
great
charter
of
england
but
with
so
much
greater
commendation
in
that
they
had
here
a
fairer
field
and
a
more
civil
way
of
decision
they
fought
it
out
under
all
the
disadvantages
imaginable
they
were
overlaid
by
numbers
the
noise
of
the
house
like
the
wind
was
against
them
and
if
not
the
sun
the
fireside
was
always
in
their
faces
nor
being
so
few
could
they
as
their
adversaries
withdraw
to
refresh
themselves
in
a
whole
day
ingagement
yet
never
was
there
a
clearer
demonstration
how
dull
a
thing
is
humane
eloquence
and
greatness
how
little
when
the
bright
truth
discovers
all
things
in
their
proper
colours
and
dimensions
and
shining
shoots
its
beams
thorow
all
their
fallacies
it
might
be
injurious
where
all
of
them
did
so
excellently
well
to
attribute
more
to
any
one
of
those
lords
than
another
unless
because
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
the
earl
of
shaftesbury
have
been
the
more
reproached
for
this
brave
action
it
be
requisite
by
a
double
proportion
of
praise
to
set
them
two
on
equal
terms
with
the
rest
of
their
companions
in
honour
the
particular
relation
in
this
debate
which
lasted
many
days
with
great
eagerness
on
both
sides
and
the
reasons
but
on
one
was
in
the
next
session
burnt
by
order
of
the
lords
but
the
sparks
of
it
will
eternally
fly
in
their
adversaries
faces
in
a
letter
to
his
constituents
dated
april
marvell
was
content
to
say
the
lords
sate
the
whole
day
yesterday
till
ten
at
night
without
rising
and
the
king
all
the
while
but
of
our
addresses
present
upon
their
bill
of
test
in
both
houses
and
are
not
yet
come
to
the
question
of
committing
it
after
prolonged
discussion
the
oath
bill
was
sent
to
the
commons
where
doubtless
it
must
have
passed
had
not
a
furious
privilege
quarrel
over
sir
john
fagg
case
made
prorogation
in
june
almost
a
necessity
in
october
parliament
met
again
and
at
once
resolved
itself
into
a
committee
upon
religion
to
prevent
the
growth
of
popery
this
time
the
king
made
almost
an
end
of
the
parliament
by
a
prorogation
which
lasted
from
november
until
february
a
period
of
fifteen
months
on
the
of
parliament
the
duke
of
buckingham
fathered
the
argument
much
used
during
the
long
recess
that
a
prorogation
extending
beyond
twelve
months
was
in
construction
of
law
a
dissolution
for
the
expression
of
this
opinion
and
the
refusal
to
recant
it
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
three
other
lords
were
ordered
to
the
tower
the
king
being
greatly
angered
by
the
duke
request
that
his
cook
might
be
allowed
to
wait
on
him
on
this
incident
marvell
remarks
thus
a
prorogation
without
precedent
was
to
be
warranted
by
an
imprisonment
without
example
a
sad
instance
whereby
the
dignity
of
parliament
and
especially
of
the
house
of
peers
did
at
present
much
suffer
and
may
probably
more
for
the
future
nothing
but
parliament
can
destroy
if
a
house
shall
once
be
felon
of
itself
and
stop
its
own
breath
taking
away
that
liberty
of
speech
which
the
king
verbally
and
of
course
allows
them
as
now
they
had
done
in
both
houses
to
what
purpose
is
it
coming
thither
the
character
of
this
house
of
commons
did
not
improve
with
age
marvell
writes
in
the
of
in
matters
of
money
they
seem
at
first
difficult
but
having
been
discoursed
with
in
private
they
are
set
right
and
begin
to
understand
it
better
themselves
and
to
convert
their
brethren
for
they
are
all
of
them
to
be
bought
and
sold
only
their
number
makes
them
cheaper
and
each
of
them
doth
so
overvalue
himself
that
sometimes
they
outstand
or
let
slip
their
own
market
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
how
small
things
in
this
case
even
members
of
great
estates
will
stoop
at
and
most
of
them
will
do
as
much
for
hopes
as
others
for
fruition
but
if
their
patience
be
tired
out
they
grow
at
last
mutinous
and
revolt
to
the
country
till
some
better
occasion
offer
among
these
are
some
men
of
the
best
understanding
were
they
of
equal
integrity
who
affect
to
ingross
all
business
to
be
able
to
quash
any
good
motion
by
parliamentary
skill
unless
themselves
be
the
authors
and
to
be
the
leading
men
of
the
house
and
for
their
natural
lives
to
continue
so
but
these
are
men
that
have
been
once
fooled
most
of
them
and
discovered
and
slighted
at
court
so
that
till
some
turn
of
state
shall
let
them
in
their
adversaries
place
in
the
mean
time
they
look
sullen
make
big
motions
and
contrive
specious
bills
for
the
subject
yet
only
wait
the
opportunity
to
be
the
instruments
of
the
same
counsels
which
they
oppose
in
others
there
is
a
third
part
still
remaining
but
as
contrary
in
themselves
as
light
and
darkness
those
are
either
the
worst
or
the
best
of
men
the
first
are
most
profligate
persons
they
have
neither
estates
consciences
nor
good
manners
yet
are
therefore
picked
out
as
the
necessary
men
and
whose
votes
will
go
furthest
the
charges
of
their
elections
are
defrayed
whatever
they
amount
to
tables
are
kept
for
them
at
whitehall
and
through
westminster
that
they
may
be
ready
at
hand
within
call
of
a
question
all
of
them
are
received
into
pension
and
know
their
which
they
never
fail
of
insomuch
that
a
great
officer
was
pleased
to
say
they
came
about
him
like
so
many
for
cheese
at
the
end
of
every
session
if
they
be
not
in
parliament
they
must
be
in
prison
and
as
they
are
protected
themselves
by
privilege
so
they
sell
their
protections
to
others
to
the
obstruction
so
many
years
together
of
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
publick
justice
for
these
it
is
that
the
long
and
frequent
adjournments
are
calculated
but
all
whether
the
court
or
the
monopolizers
of
the
country
party
or
those
that
profane
the
title
of
old
cavaliers
do
equally
though
upon
differing
reasons
like
death
apprehend
a
dissolution
but
notwithstanding
these
there
is
an
handful
of
salt
a
sparkle
of
soul
that
hath
hitherto
preserved
this
gross
body
from
putrefaction
some
gentlemen
that
are
constant
invariable
indeed
englishmen
such
as
are
above
hopes
or
fears
or
dissimulation
that
can
neither
flatter
nor
betray
their
king
or
country
but
being
conscious
of
their
own
loyalty
and
integrity
proceed
throw
good
and
bad
report
to
acquit
themselves
in
their
duty
to
god
their
prince
and
their
nation
although
so
small
a
scantling
in
number
that
men
can
scarce
reckon
of
them
more
than
a
insomuch
that
it
is
less
difficult
to
conceive
how
fire
was
first
brought
to
light
in
the
world
than
how
any
good
thing
could
ever
be
produced
out
of
an
house
of
commons
so
constituted
unless
as
that
is
imagined
to
have
come
from
the
rushing
of
trees
or
battering
of
rocks
together
by
accident
so
these
by
their
clashing
with
one
another
have
struck
out
an
useful
effect
from
so
unlikely
causes
but
whatsoever
casual
good
hath
been
wrought
at
any
time
by
the
assimilation
of
ambitious
factious
and
disappointed
members
to
the
little
but
solid
and
unbiassed
party
the
more
frequent
ill
effects
and
consequences
of
so
unequal
a
mixture
so
long
continued
are
demonstrable
and
apparent
for
while
scarce
any
man
comes
thither
with
respect
to
the
publick
service
but
in
design
to
make
and
raise
his
fortune
it
is
not
to
be
expressed
the
debauchery
and
lewdness
which
upon
occasion
of
election
to
parliaments
are
now
grown
habitual
thorow
the
nation
so
that
the
vice
and
the
expence
are
risen
to
such
a
prodigious
height
that
few
sober
men
can
indure
to
stand
to
be
chosen
on
such
conditions
from
whence
also
arise
feuds
and
perpetual
animosities
over
most
of
the
counties
and
corporations
while
gentlemen
of
worth
spirit
and
ancient
estates
and
dependances
see
themselves
overpowered
in
their
own
neighbourhood
by
the
drunkness
and
bribery
of
their
competitors
but
if
nevertheless
any
worthy
person
chance
to
carry
the
election
some
mercenary
or
corrupt
sheriff
makes
a
double
return
and
so
the
cause
is
handed
to
the
committee
of
elections
who
ask
no
better
but
are
ready
to
adopt
his
adversary
into
the
house
if
he
be
not
legitimate
and
if
the
gentleman
agrieved
seek
his
remedy
against
the
sheriff
in
and
the
proofs
be
so
palpable
that
the
king
bench
can
not
invent
how
to
do
him
injustice
yet
the
major
part
of
the
twelve
judges
shall
upon
better
consideration
vacate
the
sheriff
fine
and
reverse
the
judgement
but
those
of
them
that
dare
dissent
from
their
brethren
are
in
danger
to
be
turned
off
the
bench
without
any
cause
assigned
while
men
therefore
care
not
thus
how
they
get
into
the
house
of
commons
neither
can
it
be
expected
that
they
should
make
any
conscience
of
what
they
do
there
but
they
are
only
intent
how
to
reimburse
themselves
if
their
elections
were
at
their
own
charge
or
how
to
bargain
their
votes
for
a
place
or
a
pension
they
list
themselves
straightways
into
some
court
faction
and
it
is
as
among
them
to
what
lord
each
of
them
retain
as
when
formerly
they
wore
coats
and
badges
by
this
long
haunting
so
together
they
are
grown
too
so
familiar
among
themselves
that
all
reverence
of
their
own
assembly
is
lost
that
they
live
together
not
like
parliament
men
but
like
so
many
good
fellows
met
together
in
a
publick
house
to
make
merry
and
which
is
yet
worse
by
being
so
thoroughly
acquainted
they
understand
their
number
and
party
so
that
the
use
of
so
publick
a
counsel
is
frustrated
there
is
no
place
for
deliberation
no
perswading
by
reason
but
they
can
see
one
another
votes
through
both
throats
and
cravats
before
they
hear
them
where
the
cards
are
so
well
known
they
are
only
fit
for
a
cheat
and
no
fair
gamester
but
would
throw
them
under
the
table
it
is
a
melancholy
picture
here
perhaps
may
be
best
inserted
the
story
about
the
proffered
bribe
the
story
is
entitled
to
small
credit
but
as
helping
to
swell
and
maintain
a
tradition
concerning
an
historical
character
about
whom
little
is
positively
known
it
can
hardly
escape
mention
in
any
biography
of
marvell
a
pamphlet
printed
in
ireland
supplies
an
easy
flowing
version
of
the
tale
the
borough
of
hull
in
the
reign
of
charles
chose
andrew
marvell
a
young
gentleman
of
little
or
no
fortune
and
maintained
him
in
london
for
the
service
of
the
public
his
understanding
integrity
and
spirit
were
dreadful
to
the
then
infamous
administration
persuaded
that
he
would
be
theirs
for
properly
asking
they
sent
his
old
the
lord
treasurer
danby
to
renew
acquaintance
with
him
in
his
garret
at
parting
the
lord
treasurer
out
of
slipped
into
his
hand
an
order
upon
the
treasury
for
and
then
went
to
his
chariot
marvell
looking
at
the
paper
calls
after
the
treasurer
lord
i
request
another
moment
they
went
up
again
to
the
garret
and
jack
the
servant
boy
was
called
child
what
had
i
for
dinner
yesterday
you
remember
sir
you
had
the
little
shoulder
of
mutton
that
you
ordered
me
to
bring
from
a
woman
in
the
market
right
child
have
i
for
dinner
you
know
sir
that
you
bid
me
lay
by
the
to

so
very
right
child
go
away
lord
do
you
hear
that
andrew
marvell
dinner
is
provided
there
your
piece
of
paper
i
want
it
not
i
knew
the
sort
of
kindness
you
intended
i
live
here
to
serve
my
constituents
the
ministry
may
seek
men
for
their
purpose
am
not
one
more
letter
remains
to
be
quoted
william
ramsden
dear
will
i
have
time
to
tell
you
thus
much
of
publick
matters
the
patience
of
the
scots
under
their
oppressions
is
not
to
be
paralleled
in
any
history
they
still
continue
their
extraordinary
and
numerous
but
peaceable
field
conventicles
one
welch
is
their
and
the
last
letter
i
saw
tells
people
were
going
forty
miles
to
hear
him
there
came
out
about
christmas
last
here
a
large
book
concerning
the
growth
of
popery
and
arbitrary
government
there
have
been
great
rewards
offered
in
private
and
considerable
in
the
gazette
to
any
one
who
could
inform
of
the
author
or
printer
but
not
yet
discovered
three
or
four
printed
books
since
have
described
as
near
as
it
was
proper
to
go
the
man
being
a
member
of
parliament
marvell
to
have
been
the
author
but
if
he
had
surely
he
should
not
have
escaped
being
questioned
in
parliament
or
some
other
place
my
good
wishes
attend

and

marvell
was
no
orator
or
debater
and
though
a
member
of
parliament
for
nearly
eighteen
years
but
rarely
opened
his
mouth
in
the
house
of
commons
his
old
enemy
samuel
parker
whilst
venting
his
posthumous
spite
upon
the
author
of
the
would
have
us
believe
that
our
poet
could
not
speak
without
a
sound
basting
whereupon
having
frequently
undergone
this
discipline
he
learnt
at
length
to
hold
his
tongue
there
is
no
good
reason
for
believing
the
bishop
of
oxford
but
it
is
the
fact
that
however
taught
marvell
had
learnt
to
hold
his
tongue
his
longest
reported
speech
will
be
found
in
the
vol
iv
p
when
we
remember
how
frequently
in
those
days
marvell
pet
subjects
were
under
fierce
discussion
we
must
recognise
how
fixed
was
his
habit
of
on
one
occasion
only
are
we
enabled
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
marvell
before
the
speaker
it
was
in
march
and
is
thus
reported
in
the
though
no
mention
of
the
incident
is
made
in
the
journals
of
the
house
on
andrew
marvell
striking
sir
philip
harcourt
march
marvell
coming
up
the
house
to
his
place
stumbling
at
sir
philip
harcourt
foot
in
recovering
himself
seemed
to
give
sir
philip
a
box
on
the
ear
the
speaker
acquainting
the
house
he
saw
a
box
on
the
ear
given
and
it
was
his
duty
to
inform
the
house
of
it
this
debate
ensued
what
passed
was
through
great
acquaintance
and
familiarity
betwixt
us
he
neither
gave
him
an
affront
nor
intended
him
any
but
the
speaker
cast
a
severe
reflection
upon
him
yesterday
when
he
was
out
of
the
house
and
he
hopes
that
as
the
speaker
keeps
us
in
order
he
will
keep
himself
in
order
for
the
future
sir
what
the
speaker
said
yesterday
was
in
vindication
if
these
two
gentlemen
are
friends
already
he
would
not
make
them
friends
and
would
let
the
matter
go
no
further
sir
is
sorry
a
thing
of
this
nature
has
happened
and
no
more
sense
of
it
you
in
the
chair
and
a
stroke
struck
marvell
deserves
for
his
reflection
on
you
speaker
to
be
called
in
question
you
can
not
do
right
to
the
house
unless
you
question
it
and
moves
to
have
marvell
sent
to
the
tower
the
i
saw
a
blow
on
one
side
and
a
stroke
on
the
other
sir
marvell
had
some
kind
of
a
stumble
and
mine
was
only
a
thrust
and
the
thing
was
accidental
sir
the
persons
have
declared
the
thing
to
be
accidental
but
if
done
in
jest
not
fit
to
be
done
here
he
believes
it
an
accident
and
hopes
the
house
thinks
so
too
sec
this
does
appear
that
the
action
for
that
time
was
in
some
heat
he
can
not
excuse
marvell
who
made
a
very
severe
reflection
on
the
speaker
and
since
it
is
so
enquired
whether
you
have
done
your
duty
he
would
have
marvell
withdraw
that
you
may
consider
of
it
marvell
has
given
you
trouble
and
instead
of
excusing
himself
reflects
upon
the
speaker
a
strange
confidence
if
not
an
impudence
has
so
great
a
respect
to
the
privilege
order
and
decency
of
the
house
that
he
is
content
to
be
a
sacrifice
for
it
as
to
the
casualty
that
happened
he
saw
a
seat
empty
and
going
to
sit
in
it
his
friend
put
him
by
in
a
jocular
manner
and
what
he
did
was
of
the
same
nature
so
much
familiarity
has
ever
been
between
them
that
there
was
no
heat
in
the
thing
he
is
sorry
he
gave
an
offence
to
the
house
he
seldom
speaks
to
the
house
and
if
he
commit
an
error
in
the
manner
of
his
speech
being
not
so
well
tuned
he
hopes
it
is
not
an
offence
whether
out
or
in
the
house
he
has
a
respect
to
the
speaker
but
he
has
been
informed
that
the
speaker
resumed
something
he
had
said
with
reflection
he
did
not
think
fit
to
complain
of
seymour
to
speaker
he
believes
that
is
not
reflective
he
desires
to
comport
himself
with
all
respect
to
the
house
this
passage
with
harcourt
was
a
perfect
casualty
and
if
you
think
fit
he
will
withdraw
and
sacrifice
himself
to
the
censure
of
the
house
sir
the
blow
given
harcourt
was
with
his
hat
the
speaker
cast
his
eye
upon
both
of
them
and
both
respected
him
he
would
not
aggravate
the
thing
marvell
submits
and
he
would
have
you
leave
the
thing
as
it
is
robert
saw
the
whole
action
marvell
flung
about
three
or
four
times
with
his
hat
and
then
gave
harcourt
a
box
on
the
ear
sir
desires
now
that
his
honour
is
concerned
that
holmes
may
explain
whether
he
saw
not
marvell
with
his
hat
only
give
harcourt
the
stroke
that
time
possibly
another
time
it
might
be
the
both
holmes
and
capel
are
in
the
right
but
marvell
struck
harcourt
so
home
that
his
fist
as
well
as
his
hat
hit
him
sir
hopes
the
house
will
not
have
harcourt
say
he
received
a
blow
when
he
has
not
he
thinks
what
has
been
said
by
them
both
sufficient
hopes
that
by
the
debate
we
shall
not
make
the
thing
greater
than
it
is
would
have
them
both
reprimanded
for
it
sec
submits
the
honour
of
the
house
to
the
house
would
have
them
made
friends
and
give
that
necessary
assurance
to
the
house
and
he
for
his
part
remains
satisfied
sir
by
our
long
sitting
together
we
lose
by
our
familiarity
and
acquaintance
the
decencies
of
the
house
he
has
seen
in
the
house
and
people
very
orderly
not
so
much
as
to
read
a
letter
or
set
up
a
foot
one
could
scarce
know
anybody
in
the
house
but
him
that
spoke
he
would
have
the
speaker
declare
that
order
ought
to
be
kept
but
as
to
that
gentleman
marvell
to
rest
satisfied
the
general
impression
left
upon
the
mind
is
that
of
a
but
choleric
gentleman
full
of
likes
and
dislikes
readier
with
his
tongue
in
the
lobby
than
with
set
speeches
in
the
chamber
a
solitary
politician
with
a
biting
pen
satirists
must
not
complain
if
they
have
enemies
marvell
vein
of
satire
was
never
worked
out
and
the
political
poems
of
his
last
decade
are
fuller
than
ever
of
a
savage
humour
how
he
kept
his
ears
is
a
repeated
wonder
he
is
said
to
have
been
on
terms
of
intimate
friendship
with
prince
rupert
and
it
is
a
steady
tradition
that
the
king
was
one
of
his
amused
readers
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
even
charles
the
second
could
have
seen
any
humour
good
or
bad
in
such
a
couplet
the
poor
priapus
king
led
by
the
nose
looks
as
a
thing
set
up
to
scare
the
crows
nor
can
the
following
verses
have
been
read
with
much
pleasure
either
at
whitehall
or
in
a
punt
whilst
fishing
at
windsor
their
occasion
was
the
setting
up
in
the
in
the
city
of
london
of
a
statue
of
the
king
by
sir
robert
viner
a
city
knight
to
whom
charles
was
very
heavily
in
debt
sir
robert
having
a
frugal
mind
had
acquired
a
statue
of
john
sobieski
trampling
on
the
turk
which
judiciously
altered
was
made
to
pass
muster
so
as
to
represent
the
pensioner
of
louis
the
fourteenth
and
the
vendor
of
dunkirk
trampling
on
oliver
cromwell
as
cities
that
to
the
fierce
conqueror
yield
do
at
their
own
charges
their
citadels
build
so
sir
robert
advanced
the
king
statue
in
token
of
bankers
defeated
and
lombard
street
broken
some
thought
it
a
knightly
and
generous
deed
obliging
the
city
with
a
king
and
a
steed
when
with
honour
he
might
from
his
word
have
gone
back
he
that
vows
in
a
calm
is
absolved
by
a
wrack
but
now
it
appears
from
the
first
to
the
last
to
be
a
revenge
and
a
malice
forecast
upon
the
king
birthday
to
set
up
a
thing
that
shows
him
a
monkey
much
more
than
a
king
when
each
one
that
passes
finds
fault
with
the
horse
yet
all
do
affirm
that
the
king
is
much
worse
and
some
by
the
likeness
sir
robert
suspect
that
he
did
for
the
king
his
own
statue
erect
thus
to
see
him
disfigured
the
chid
who
up
on
their
panniers
more
gracefully
rid
and
so
loose
in
his
seat
that
all
persons
agree
sir
william
peak
sits
much
firmer
than
he
but
sir
robert
affirms
that
we
do
him
much
wrong
is
the
at
work
to
reform
him
so
long
but
alas
he
will
never
arrive
at
his
end
for
it
is
such
a
king
as
no
chisel
can
mend
but
with
all
his
errors
restore
us
our
king
if
ever
you
hope
in
december
for
spring
for
though
all
the
world
can
not
show
such
another
yet
we
rather
have
him
than
his
bigoted
brother
of
a
more
exalted
vein
of
satire
the
following
extract
may
serve
as
an
example

the
stone
effigies
of
charles
the

at

cross
and
charles
the

at
is
in
its
own
rough
way
masterly
satire
for
the
popular
ear
if
the
roman
church
good
christians
oblige
ye
to
believe
man
and
beast
have
spoken
in
effigy
why
should
we
not
credit
the
public
discourses
in
a
dialogue
between
two
inanimate
horses
the
horses
i
mean
of
and
charing
who
told
many
truths
worth
any
man
hearing
since
viner
and
osborn
did
buy
and
provide
for
the
two
mighty
monarchs
who
now
do
bestride
the
stately
brass
stallion
and
the
white
marble
steed
the
night
came
together
by
all
is
agreed
when
both
kings
were
weary
of
sitting
all
day
they
stole
off
incognito
each
his
own
way
and
then
the
two
jades
after
mutual
salutes
not
only
discoursed
but
fell
to
disputes
the
dialogue
is
too
long
to
be
quoted
charles
the
second

boldly
declares
de
witt
and
cromwell
had
each
a
brave
soul
i
freely
declare

i
am

though
his

did

he
made

great
and
his

picture
of

cooper
to
sidney
sussex

said
to
have

it
the
lines

the
satire
ends
thus
but
canst
them
devise

will
be

a

have
repented

these
probably
are
the
lines
which
spread
the
popular
but
mistaken
belief
that
marvell
was
a
republican
andrew
marvell
died
in
his
lodgings
in
london
on
the
of
august
colonel
grosvenor
writing
to
george
treby
afterwards
chief
of
the
common
pleas
on
the
of
august
reports
andrew
marvell
died
yesterday
of
apoplexy
parliament
was
not
sitting
at
the
time
what
was
said
of
the
elder
andrew
may
also
be
said
of
the
younger
he
was
happy
in
the
moment
of
his
death
the
one
just
escaped
the
civil
war
the
other
the
popish
plot
marvell
was
thought
to
have
been
poisoned
such
a
suspicion
in
those
bad
times
was
not
his
satires
rough
but
moving
had
been
widely
read
and
his
fears
for
the
constitution
his
dread
of
the
grim
monster
arbitrary
power
the
ugliest
giant
ever
trod
the
earth
infested
many
breasts
and
bred
terror
marvell
the
island
watchful
sentinel
stood
in
the
gap
and
bravely
kept
his
post
the
post
was
one
of
obvious
danger
and
whether
fate
or
art
untwin
his
thread
remains
in
doubt
the
doubt
has
now
been
dissipated
by
the
research
of
an
accomplished
physician
gee
who
in
communicated
to
the
march
an
extract
from
richard
morton
greek
pyretologia
containing
a
full
account
of
marvell
sickness
and
death
art
his
thread
but
it
was
the
doctor
art
gee
translation
of
morton
medical
latin
is
as
follows
in
this
manner
was
that
most
famous
man
andrew
marvell
carried
off
from
amongst
the
living
before
his
time
to
the
great
loss
of
the
republic
and
especially
the
republic
of
letters
through
the
ignorance
of
an
old
conceited
doctor
who
was
in
the
habit
on
all
occasions
of
raving
excessively
against
peruvian
bark
as
if
it
were
a
common
plague
howbeit
without
any
clear
indication
in
the
interval
after
a
third
fit
of
regular
tertian
ague
and
by
way
of
preparation
so
that
all
things
might
seem
to
be
done
most
methodically
blood
was
copiously
drawn
from
the
patient
who
was
advanced
in
years
here
follow
more
details
of
treatment
which
i
pass
over
the
way
having
been
made
ready
after
this
fashion
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
fit
a
great
febrifuge
was
given
a
draught
that
is
to
say
of
venice
treacle
etc
by
the
orders
the
patient
was
covered
up
close
with
blankets
say
rather
was
buried
under
them
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
and
sweat
so
that
he
might
escape
the
cold
shivers
which
are
wont
to
accompany
the
onset
of
the
he
was
seized
with
the
deepest
sleep
and
colliquative
sweats
and
in
the
short
space
of
hours
from
the
time
of
the
he
died
comatose
he
died
who
had
a
single
ounce
of
peruvian
bark
been
properly
given
might
easily
have
escaped
in
hours
from
the
jaws
of
the
grave
and
the
disease
and
so
burning
with
anger
i
informed
the
doctor
when
he
told
me
this
story
without
any
sense
of
shame
marvell
was
buried
on
the
of
august
under
the
pews
in
the
south
side
of
giles
church
in
the
fields
under
the
window
wherein
is
painted
on
glass
a
red
lion
so
writes
the
invaluable
aubrey
who
tells
us
he
had
the
account
from
the
sexton
who
made
the
grave
in
giles
church
was
a
brick
structure
built
by
laud
the
present
imposing
church
was
built
on
the
site
of
the
old
one
in
in
captain
thompson
so
he
tells
us
visited
the
grand
mausoleum
under
the
church
of
giles
to
search
for
the
coffin
in
which
marvell
was
placed
in
this
vault
were
deposited
upwards
of
a
thousand
bodies
but
i
could
find
no
plate
of
an
earlier
date
than
i
do
therefore
suppose
the
new
church
is
built
upon
the
former
burial
place
the
poet
robert
nettleton
in
placed
on
the
north
side
of
the
present
church
upon
a
black
marble
slab
a
long
epitaph
still
to
be
seen
recording
the
fact
that
near
to
this
place
lyeth
the
body
of
andrew
marvell
esquire
at
no
great
distance
from
this
slab
is
the
tombstone
recently
brought
in
from
the
graveyard
outside
of
chapman
a
fine
roman
monument
prepared
by
the
care
and
at
the
cost
of
the
poet
friend
inigo
jones
still
left
exposed
in
what
is
now
a
doleful
garden
not
at
all
marvellian
is
the
tombstone
of
richard
penderel
of
boscobel

of
the
five
yeomen
brothers

helped
charles

escape
after
worcester

herbert

cherbury
in
and
shirley
the
dramatist

had
been
carried
to
the
same
place
of
sepulture
aubrey
describes
marvell
as
of
middling
stature
pretty
roundish
faced
hazell
eye
brown
hair
he
was
in
his
conversation
very
modest
and
of
very
few
words
though
he
loved
wine
he
would
never
drink
hard
in
company
and
was
wont
to
say
that
he
would
not
play
the
good
fellow
in
any
man
company
in
whose
hands
he
would
not
trust
his
life
he
kept
bottles
of
wine
at
his
lodgings
and
many
times
he
would
drink
liberally
by
himself
and
to
refresh
his
spirit
and
exalt
his
muse

joint
administration
was
granted
by
the
prerogative
court
of
canterbury
marvell
relictæ
et
johni
greni
this
is
the
first
time
we
hear
of
there
being
any
wife
in
the
case
a
creditor
of
a
deceased
person
could
not
obtain
administration
without
citing
the
next
of
kin
but
a
widow
was
entitled
under
a
statute
of
henry
as
of
right
to
administration
and
it
may
be
that
green
thought
the
quickest
way
of
being
paid
his
debt
was
to
invent
a
widow
the
practice
of
the
court
required
an
affidavit
from
the
widow
deposing
that
she
was
the
lawful
relict
of
the
deceased
but
this
assertion
on
oath
seems
in
ordinary
cases
to
have
been
sufficient
if
the
customary
fees
were
forthcoming
captain
thompson
roundly
asserts
that
the
alleged
mary
marvell
was
a
cheat
and
no
more
than
the
keeper
where
he
had
last
lived
and
marvell
was
a
migratory
man
mary
marvell
name
appears
once
again
in
the
forefront
of
the
first
edition
of
marvell
where
she
certifies
all
the
contents
to
be
her
husband
works
this
may
have
been
a
publisher
as
the
affidavit
may
have
been
a
creditor
artifice
as
against
this
grosart
who
believed
in
mary
marvell
reminds
us
that
robert
boulter
the
publisher
of
the
poems
was
a
most
respectable
man
and
a
friend
both
of
milton
and
marvell
and
not
at
all
likely
either
to
cheat
the
public
with
a
falsely
signed
certificate
or
to
be
cheated
by
a
london
keeper

marvell
work
as
a
man
of

easily
divides
itself
into
the
inevitable
three
parts
as
a
poet
properly
so
called
as
a
political
satirist
using
rhyme
and
as
a
writer
of
prose
upon
marvell
work

a
poet

so
called

curious

is

no
opportunity

opinion

death
namely
when

small
folio
of
made
its
appearance
this
volume
although
not
containing
the
ode
upon
cromwell
return
from
or
the
lines
upon
cromwell
death
did
contain
saving
these
exceptions
all
the
best
of
marvell
verse
how
this
poetry
was
received
to
whom
and
to
how
many
it
gave
pleasure
we
have
not
the
means
of
knowing
the
book
like
all
other
good
books
had
to
take
its
chance
good
poetry
is
never
exactly
unpopular
its
difficulty
is
to
get
a
hearing
to
secure
a
i
feel
certain
that
from
onwards
many
ingenuous
souls
read
and
nymph
complaining
for
the
death
of
her
his
coy
and
with
pure
delight
in
the
poet
pomfret
of
whose
johnson
said
in
perhaps
no
composition
in
our
language
has
been
oftener
perused
and
who
southey
in
declared
to
be
the
most
popular
of
english
poets
in
i
say
this
poet
pomfret
says
in
a
preface
sensibly
enough
to
please
everyone
would
be
a
new
thing
and
to
write
so
as
to
please
no
body
would
be
as
new
for
even
quarles
and
wythers
have
their
admirers
so
liable
is
the
public
taste
to
fluctuations
and
reversals
that
though
quarles
and
wither
are
not
popular
authors
they
certainly
number
many
more
readers
than
pomfret
southey
most
popular
of
english
poets
who
has
now
it
is
to
be
feared
finally
disappeared
even
from
the
anthologies
but
if
quarles
and
wither
had
their
admirers
even
in
the
poet
marvell
we
may
be
sure
had
his
also
marvell
had
many
poetical
contemporaries
at
least
poets
of
mark
and
interest
to
most
of
whom
as
well
as
to
some
of
his
immediate
predecessors
he
stood
as
i
must
suppose
in
some
degree
of
poetical
relationship
with
milton
and
dryden
no
comparison
will
suggest
itself
but
with
donne
and
cowley
with
waller
and
denham
with
butler
and
the
now
wellnigh
forgotten
cleveland
with
walker
and
charles
cotton
with
rochester
and
dorset
some
resemblances
certain
influences
may
be
found
and
traced
from
the
order
of
his
mind
and
his
prose
style
i
should
judge
marvell
to
have
been
both
a
reader
and
a
critic
of
his
contemporaries
in
verse
and
prose
though
of
his
criticisms
little
remains
of
butler
he
twice
speaks
with
great
respect
and
his
sole
reference
to
the
dead
cleveland
is
kindly
of
milton
we
know
what
he
thought
whilst
aubrey
tells
us
that
he
once
heard
marvell
say
that
the
earl
of
rochester
was
the
only
man
in
england
that
had
the
true
vein
of
satire
be
these
influences
what
they
may
or
must
have
been
to
us
marvell
occupies
as
a
poet
a
niche
by
himself
a
finished
master
of
his
art
he
never
was
he
could
not
write
verses
like
his
friend
lovelace
or
like
cowley
or
waller
lines
on
a
girdle
he
had
not
the
inexhaustible
astonishing
though
tiresome
wit
of
butler
he
is
often
clumsy
and
sometimes
almost
babyish
one
has
frequently
occasion
to
wonder
how
a
man
of
business
could
allow
himself
to
be
tickled
by
such
obvious
straws
as
are
too
many
of
the
conceits
which
give
him
pleasure
to
attribute
all
the
conceits
of
this
period
to
the
influence
of
donne
is
but
a
poor
excuse
after
all
the
worst
thing
that
can
be
said
against
poetry
is
that
there
is
so
much
tedium
in
it
the
glorious
moments
are
all
too
few
it
is
his
honest
recognition
of
this
woeful
fact
that
makes
johnson
with
all
his
faults
lying
thick
about
him
the
most
consolatory
of
our
critics
to
the
ordinary
reading
man
tediousness
is
the
most
fatal
of
all
faults
unhappily
this
pernicious
failure
is
that
which
an
author
is
least
able
to
discover
we
are
seldom
tiresome
to
ourselves
perhaps
no
man
ever
thought
a
line
superfluous
when
he
wrote
it
of
the
under
see
also
under
that
marvell
is
never
tiresome
i
will
not
assert
but
he
too
has
his
glorious
moments
and
they
are
all
his
own
in
the
whole
compass
of
our
poetry
there
is
nothing
quite
like
marvell
love
of
gardens
and
woods
of
meads
and
rivers
and
birds
it
is
a
love
not
learnt
from
books
not
borrowed
from
it
is
not
indulged
in
to
prove
anything
it
is
all
sheer
enjoyment
bind
me
ye
woodbines
in
your
twines
curb
me
about
ye
gadding
vines
and
oh
so
close
your
circles
lace
that
i
may
never
leave
this
place
but
lest
your
fetters
prove
too
weak
ere
i
your
silken
bondage
break
do
you
o
brambles
chain
me
too
and
courteous
briars
nail
me
through
here
at
the
fountain
sliding
foot
or
at
some
mossy
root
casting
the
body
vest
aside
my
soul
into
the
boughs
does
glide
there
like
a
bird
it
sits
and
sings
no
poet
is
happier
than
marvell
in
creating
the
impression
that
he
made
his
verses
out
of
doors
he
saw
the
partridge
drum
in
the
woods
he
heard
the
woodcock
evening
hymn
he
found
the
tawny
thrush
broods
and
the
shy
hawk
did
wait
for
him
what
others
did
at
distance
hear
and
guessed
within
the
thicket
gloom
was
shown
to
this
philosopher
and
at
his
bidding
seemed
to
come
from
emerson
marvell
immediate
fame
as
a
true
poet
was
i
dare
say
obscured
for
a
good
while
both
by
its
original
note
for
originality
is
always
forbidding
at
first
sight
and
by
its
author
fame
as
a
satirist
and
his
reputation
as
a
lover
of
liberty
glorious
feast
it
was
as
one
of
the
poets
encountered
in
the
on
affairs
of
fifth
edition
that
marvell
was
best
known
during
the
greater
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
as
milton
friend
marvell
had
as
it
were
a
in
the
great
miltonic
temple
the
patriotic
member
of
parliament
who
refused
in
his
poverty
the
proffered
bribe
became
a
character
in
history
before
the
exquisite
quality
of
his
was
recognised
there
was
a
cult
for
liberty
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
marvell
name
was
on
the
list
of
its
professors
wordsworth
sonnet
has
preserved
this
tradition
for
us
great
men
have
been
among
us
hands
that
and
tongues
that
utter
wisdom
better
none
the
later
sydney
marvell
harrington
in
thomas
cooke
printed
an
edition
of
marvell
works
which
contains
the
poetry
that
was
in
the
folio
of
and
in
edition
was
reprinted
by
davies
it
was
probably
davies
edition
that
charles
lamb
writing
to
godwin
on
sunday
december
says
he
was
just
going
to
possess
a
notable
addition
to
lamb
library
and
an
event
in
the
history
of
the
progress
of
marvell
poetical
reputation

edition
containing
the
and
other
pieces
followed
in
in
the
great
poetical
collection
of
the
booksellers
which
they
improperly
called
johnson
improperly
because
the
poets
were
with
four
exceptions
the
choice
not
of
the
biographer
but
of
the
booksellers
anxious
to
retain
their
imaginary
copyright
marvell
has
no
place
george
ellis
in
his
of
the
early
english
poets
first
published
in
printed
from
marvell
and
in
part
and
when
bowles
that
once
famous
sonneteer
edited
pope
in
he
by
way
of
belittling
pope
quoted
two
lines
from
marvell
now
well
known
but
unfamiliar
in
and
through
the
hazels
thick
espy
the
hatching
throstle
shining
eye
he
remarked
upon
them
the
last
circumstance
is
new
highly
poetical
and
could
only
have
been
described
by
one
who
was
a
real
lover
of
nature
and
a
witness
of
her
beauties
in
her
most
solitary
retirement
on
this
mark
pattison
makes
the
comment
that
the
lines
only
prove
that
marvell
when
a
boy
went
vol
ii
a
pursuit
denied
to
pope
by
his
manifold
infirmities
the
poet
campbell
in
his
gave
an
excellent
sketch
of
marvell
life
and
selected
nymph
and
and
then
came
fresh
from
talk
with
charles
lamb
hazlitt
with
his
which
contains
the
his
coy
nymph
and
drop
of
the
hill
and
grove
at
in
this
choice
we
may
see
the
hand
of
charles
lamb
as
tennyson
may
be
noticed
in
the
selection
made
in
palgrave
dean
trench
in
his
book
of
english
gives
and
the
and
drop
of
in
ward
marvell
is
represented
by
drop
of
the
and
the
on
paradise
thanks
to
these
later
anthologies
and
to
the
quotations
from
and
appleton
in
the
of
fame
as
a
true
poet
has
of
recent
years
become
widespread
and
is
now
whatever
vicissitudes
it
may
have
endured
well
established
as
a
satirist
in
rhyme
marvell
has
shared
the
usual
and
not
undeserved
fate
of
almost
all
satirists
of
their
age
and
the
authors
of
lines
written
in
heat
to
give
expression
to
the
anger
of
the
hour
may
well
be
content
if
their
effusions
give
the
pain
or
teach
the
lesson
they
were
intended
to
give
or
teach
if
you
lash
the
age
you
do
so
presumably
for
the
benefit
of
the
age
it
is
very
hard
to
transmit
even
a
fierce
and
genuine
indignation
from
one
age
to
another
satires
were
too
hastily
composed
too
roughly
constructed
too
redolent
of
the
occasion
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
poetry
to
the
careful
and
reader
of
history
particularly
if
he
chance
to
have
a
feeling
for
the
house
of
commons
not
merely
as
an
institution
but
as
a
place
of
resort
marvell
satirical
poems
must
always
be
intensely
interesting
they
strike
me
as
honest
in
their
main
intention
and
never
very
wide
of
the
mark
hallam
says
in
his
lofty
way
we
read
with
nothing
but
disgust
the
satirical
poetry
of
cleveland
butler
oldham
marvell
and
he
adds
marvell
satires
are
gross
and
stupid
gross
they
certainly
occasionally
are
but
stupid
they
never
are
marvell
was
far
too
a
politician
and
too
shrewd
a
man
ever
to
be
stupid
as
a
satirist
marvell
had
if
he
wanted
them
many
models
of
style
but
he
really
needed
none
for
he
just
wrote
down
in
rhyme
whatever
his
head
or
his
spleen
suggested
to
his
fancy
every
now
and
again
there
is
a
noble
outburst
of
feeling
and
a
couplet
of
great
felicity
i
confess
to
taking
great
pleasure
in
marvell
satires
as
a
prose
writer
marvell
has
many
merits
and
one
great
fault
he
has
fire
and
fancy
and
was
the
owner
and
master
of
a
precise
vocabulary
well
fitted
to
clothe
and
set
forth
a
and
lofty
argument
he
knew
how
to
be
both
terse
and
diffuse
and
can
compress
himself
into
a
line
or
expand
over
a
paragraph
he
has
touches
of
a
grave
irony
as
well
as
of
a
boisterous
humour
he
can
tell
an
anecdote
and
elaborate
a
parable
swift
we
know
had
not
only
butler
by
heart
but
was
also
we
may
be
sure
a
close
student
of
marvell
prose
his
great
fault
is
a
very
common
one
he
is
too
long
he
forgets
how
quickly
a
reader
grows
tired
he
is
so
interested
in
the
evolutions
of
his
own
mind
that
he
forgets
his
audience
his
interest
at
times
seems
as
if
it
were
going
to
prove
endless
it
is
the
first
business
of
an
author
to
arrest
and
then
to
retain
the
attention
of
the
reader
to
do
this
requires
great
artifice
among
the
masters
of
english
prose
it
would
be
rash
to
rank
marvell
who
was
neither
a
hooker
nor
a
taylor
none
the
less
he
was
the
owner
of
a
prose
style
which
some
people
think
the
best
prose
style
of
all
that
of
honest
men
who
have
something
