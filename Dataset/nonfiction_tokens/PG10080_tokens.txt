foreword
it
is
a
real
pleasure
to
write
this
foreword
to
the
book
which
harriot
stanton
blatch
dedicates
to
the
women
of
great
britain
and
france
to
the
women
who
through
the
years
of
the
great
war
have
stood
as
the
second
line
of
defense
against
the
german
horror
which
menaces
the
liberty
and
civilization
of
the
entire
world
there
could
be
no
more
timely
book
blatch
aim
is
to
stir
the
women
of
this
country
to
the
knowledge
that
this
is
their
war
and
also
to
make
all
our
people
feel
that
we
and
especially
our
government
should
welcome
the
service
of
women
and
make
use
of
it
to
the
utmost
in
other
words
the
appeal
of
blatch
is
essentially
an
appeal
for
service
no
one
has
more
vividly
realized
that
service
benefits
the
one
who
serves
precisely
as
it
benefits
the
one
who
is
served
i
join
with
her
in
the
appeal
that
the
women
shall
back
the
men
with
service
and
that
the
men
in
their
turn
shall
frankly
and
eagerly
welcome
the
rendering
of
such
service
the
basis
of
service
by
equals
for
a
common
blatch
makes
her
appeal
primarily
because
of
the
war
needs
of
the
moment
but
she
has
in
view
no
less
the
great
tasks
of
the
future
i
welcome
her
book
as
an
answer
to
the
cry
that
the
admission
of
women
to
an
equal
share
in
the
right
of
self
government
will
tend
to
soften
the
body
politic
most
certainly
i
will
ever
set
my
face
like
flint
against
any
unhealthy
softening
of
our
civilization
and
as
an
answer
in
advance
to
i
explain
that
i
do
not
mean
softness
in
the
sense
of
i
mean
the
softness
which
extends
to
the
head
and
to
the
moral
fibre
i
mean
the
softness
which
manifests
itself
either
in
unhealthy
sentimentality
or
in
a
materialism
which
may
be
either
thoughtless
and
or
sordid
and
i
believe
that
the
best
women
when
thoroughly
aroused
and
when
the
right
appeal
is
made
to
them
will
offer
our
surest
means
of
resisting
this
unhealthy
softening
no
man
who
is
not
blind
can
fail
to
see
that
we
have
entered
a
new
day
in
the
great
epic
march
of
the
ages
for
good
or
for
evil
the
old
days
have
passed
and
it
rests
with
us
the
men
and
women
now
alive
to
decide
whether
in
the
new
days
the
world
is
to
be
a
better
or
a
worse
place
to
live
in
for
our
descendants
in
this
new
world
women
are
to
stand
on
an
equal
footing
with
men
in
ways
and
to
an
extent
never
hitherto
dreamed
of
in
this
country
they
are
on
the
eve
of
securing
and
in
much
of
the
country
have
already
secured
their
full
political
rights
it
is
imperative
that
they
should
understand
exactly
as
it
is
imperative
that
men
should
understand
that
such
rights
are
of
worse
than
no
avail
unless
the
will
for
the
performance
of
duty
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
acquirement
of
the
privilege
if
the
women
in
this
country
reinforce
the
elements
that
tend
to
a
softening
of
the
moral
fibre
to
a
weakening
of
the
will
and
unwillingness
to
look
ahead
or
to
face
hardship
and
labor
and
danger
for
a
high
ideal
then
all
of
us
alike
men
and
women
will
suffer
but
if
they
show
under
the
new
conditions
the
will
to
develop
strength
and
the
high
idealism
and
the
iron
resolution
which
under
less
favorable
circumstances
were
shown
by
the
women
of
the
revolution
and
of
the
civil
war
then
our
nation
has
before
it
a
career
of
greatness
never
hitherto
equaled
this
book
is
fundamentally
an
appeal
not
that
woman
shall
enjoy
any
privilege
unearned
but
that
hers
shall
be
the
right
to
do
more
than
she
has
ever
yet
done
and
to
do
it
on
terms
of
partnership
with
men
equality
of
right
does
not
mean
identity
of
function
but
it
does
necessarily
imply
identity
of
purpose
in
the
performance
of
duty
blatch
shows
why
every
woman
who
inherits
the
womanly
virtues
of
the
past
and
who
has
grasped
the
ideal
of
the
added
womanly
virtues
of
the
present
and
the
future
should
support
this
war
with
all
her
strength
and
soul
she
testifies
from
personal
knowledge
to
the
hideous
brutalities
shown
toward
women
and
children
by
the
germany
of
and
she
adds
the
fine
sentence
women
fight
for
a
place
in
the
sun
for
those
who
hold
right
above
might
she
shows
why
women
must
unstintedly
give
their
labor
in
order
to
win
this
war
and
why
the
labor
of
the
women
must
be
used
to
back
up
both
the
labor
and
the
fighting
work
of
the
men
for
the
fighting
men
leave
gaps
in
the
labor
world
which
must
be
filled
by
the
work
of
women
she
says
in
another
sentence
worth
remembering
the
man
behind
the
counter
should
of
course
be
moved
to
a
muscular
employment
but
we
must
not
interpret
his
dalliance
with
tapes
and
ribbons
as
a
proof
of
a
superfluity
of
men
particularly
valuable
is
her
description
of
the
mobilization
of
women
in
great
britain
and
france
from
these
facts
she
draws
the
conclusion
as
to
america
needs
along
this
very
line
she
paints
as
vividly
as
i
have
ever
known
painted
the
truth
as
to
why
it
is
a
merit
that
women
should
be
forced
to
work
a
merit
that
should
be
forced
to
work
it
is
just
as
good
for
women
as
for
men
that
they
should
have
to
use
body
and
mind
that
they
should
not
be
idlers
as
she
puts
it
active
mothers
insure
a
virile
race
the
peaceful
nation
if
its
women
fall
victims
to
the
luxury
which
rapidly
increasing
wealth
brings
will
decay
man
power
must
give
itself
unreservedly
at
the
front
woman
power
must
show
not
only
eagerness
but
fitness
to
substitute
for
man
power
i
commend
especially
the
chapter
containing
the
sentence
this
war
may
prove
to
us
the
wisdom
and
economy
of
devoting
public
funds
to
mothers
rather
than
to
crèches
and
juvenile
asylums
and
also
the
chapter
in
which
the
author
tells
women
that
if
they
are
merely
looking
for
a
soft
place
in
life
their
collective
demand
for
a
fair
field
and
no
favor
will
be
wholly
ineffective
the
doors
for
service
now
stand
open
and
it
rests
with
the
women
themselves
to
say
whether
they
will
enter
in
the
last
chapter
is
itself
an
unconscious
justification
of
woman
right
to
a
share
in
the
great
governmental
decisions
which
are
vital
no
statesman
or
publicist
could
set
forth
more
clearly
than
blatch
the
need
of
winning
this
war
in
order
to
prevent
either
endless
and
ruinous
wars
in
the
future
or
else
a
world
despotism
which
would
mean
the
atrophy
of
everything
that
really
tends
to
the
elevation
of
mankind
blatch
has
herself
rendered
a
very
real
service
by
this
appeal
that
women
should
serve
and
that
men
should
let
them
serve
theodore
roosevelt
i
our
foe
the
nations
in
which
women
have
influenced
national
aims
face
the
nation
that
glorifies
brute
force
america
opposes
the
exaltation
of
the
glittering
sword
opposes
the
determination
of
one
nation
to
dominate
the
world
opposes
the
claim
that
the
head
of
one
ruling
family
is
the
direct
and
only
representative
of
the
creator
and
above
all
america
opposes
the
idea
that
might
makes
right
let
us
admit
the
full
weight
of
the
paradox
that
a
people
in
the
name
of
peace
turns
to
force
of
arms
the
tragedy
for
us
lay
in
there
being
no
choice
of
ways
since
pacific
groups
had
failed
to
create
machinery
to
adjust
vital
international
differences
and
since
the
allies
each
in
turn
we
the
last
had
been
struck
by
a
foe
determined
to
settle
disagreements
by
force
never
did
a
nation
make
a
crusade
more
just
than
this
of
ours
we
were
patient
too
long
patient
perhaps
with
challenges
we
seek
no
conquest
we
fight
to
protect
the
freedom
of
our
citizens
on
standard
is
written
democracy
on
that
of
germany
autocracy
without
reservation
women
can
give
their
all
to
attain
our
end
there
may
be
a
cleavage
between
the
german
people
and
the
ruling
class
it
may
be
that
our
foe
is
merely
the
military
caste
though
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
we
have
the
entire
german
nation
on
our
hands
the
supremacy
of
might
may
be
a
doctrine
merely
instilled
in
the
minds
of
the
people
by
its
rulers
perhaps
the
weed
is
not
indigenous
but
it
flourishes
nevertheless
rabbits
did
not
belong
in
australia
nor
pondweed
in
england
but
there
they
are
and
dominating
the
situation
arrogance
of
the
strong
towards
the
weak
of
the
better
placed
towards
the
less
well
placed
is
part
of
the
government
teaching
in
germany
the
peasant
woman
harries
the
dog
that
strains
at
the
market
cart
her
husband
harries
her
as
she
helps
the
cow
drag
the
plough
the
petty
officer
harries
the
peasant
when
he
is
a
raw
recruit
and
the
young
lieutenant
harries
the
petty
officer
and
so
it
goes
up
to
the
highest
a
system
on
the
part
of
the
superior
to
bring
the
inferior
to
a
high
point
of
material
efficiency
the
propelling
spirit
is
devotion
to
the
fatherland
each
believes
himself
a
cog
in
the
machine
chosen
of
god
to
achieve
his
purposes
on
earth
the
world
hears
of
the
kaiser
ich
und
gott
of
his
mailed
fist
beating
down
his
enemies
but
those
who
have
lived
in
germany
know
that
exactly
the
same
spirit
reigns
in
every
class
the
strong
in
chastizing
his
inferior
has
the
conviction
that
since
might
makes
right
he
is
the
direct
representative
of
deity
on
the
particular
occasion
the
overbearing
spirit
of
the
prussian
military
caste
has
drilled
a
race
to
worship
might
men
are
overbearing
towards
women
women
towards
children
and
the
laws
reflect
the
cruelties
of
the
strong
towards
the
weak
as
the
recent
petition
of
german
suffragists
to
the
reichstag
states
their
country
stands
in
the
lowest
rank
of
nations
as
regards
rights
it
is
a
platitude
just
now
worth
repeating
that
the
civilization
of
a
people
is
indicated
by
the
position
accorded
to
its
women
on
that
head
then
the
teutonic
kultur
stands
challenged
an
english
friend
of
mine
threw
down
the
gauntlet
thirty
years
ago
she
had
married
a
german
officer
after
living
at
army
posts
all
over
the
empire
she
declared
what
we
foreigners
take
as
simple
childlikeness
in
the
germans
is
merely
lack
of
civilization
this
keen
analysis
came
from
a
woman
trained
as
an
investigator
and
equipped
with
perfect
command
of
the
language
of
her
adopted
country
lack
of
civilization
perhaps
that
explains
my
having
seen
again
and
again
officers
striking
the
soldiers
they
were
drilling
and
journeys
made
torture
through
witnessing
slapping
and
of
children
by
their
parents
the
memory
of
a
father
conduct
towards
his
little
son
will
never
be
wiped
out
he
twisted
the
child
arm
struck
him
savagely
from
time
to
time
and
for
no
reason
but
that
the
child
did
not
sit
bolt
upright
and
keep
absolutely
motionless
the
witnesses
of
the
brutality
smiled
approvingly
at
the
man
and
scowled
at
the
child
my
own
protest
being
met
with
amazed
silence
and
in
no
way
regarded
i
left
the
compartment
i
was
near
eisenach
and
i
wished
some
good
fairy
would
put
in
my
hand
that
inkpot
which
luther
threw
at
the
devil
severity
towards
children
is
the
rule
the
child
for
weal
or
woe
is
in
the
complete
control
of
its
parents
and
corporal
punishment
is
allowed
in
the
schools
the
grim
saying
saure
wochen
frohe
feste
seems
to
express
the
pedagogic
philosophy
the
only
trouble
is
that
nature
does
not
give
this
attitude
her
sanction
for
germany
reveals
to
us
that
figure
the
most
pathetic
in
life
the
child
suicide
the
man
responding
to
his
stern
upbringing
is
in
turn
cruel
to
his
inferiors
and
full
of
subterfuge
in
dealing
with
equals
he
is
at
home
in
the
intrigues
which
have
startled
the
world
in
such
a
society
the
frank
and
gentle
go
to
the
wall
or
get
into
trouble
and
emigrate
we
have
profited
let
us
not
forget
it
by
the
plucky
german
immigrants
who
threw
off
the
yoke
and
who
now
have
the
satisfaction
of
finding
themselves
fighting
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
men
of
their
adopted
country
to
free
the
fatherland
of
the
taskmaster
the
philosophy
of
might
quite
naturally
reflects
itself
in
the
education
of
girls
once
when
i
visited
a
höhere
töchter
schule
the
principal
had
a
class
in
geometry
recite
for
my
edification
i
soon
saw
that
the
young
girl
who
had
been
chosen
as
the
star
pupil
to
wrestle
with
the
pons
asinorum
was
giving
an
exhibition
of
memorizing
and
not
of
mathematical
reasoning
i
asked
the
principal
if
my
surmise
were
correct
he
replied
without
hesitation
yes
it
was
entirely
a
feat
in
memory
females
have
only
low
reasoning
power
i
urged
that
if
this
were
so
it
would
be
well
to
train
the
faculty
but
he
countered
with
the
assertion
we
germans
do
not
think
so
women
are
happier
and
more
useful
without
logic
it
would
be
difficult
to
surpass
in
its
subtle
cruelty
the
etiquette
at
a
military
function
the
lieutenant
and
his
wife
come
early
this
is
expected
of
them
for
a
few
moments
they
play
the
role
of
honored
guests
the
wife
is
shown
by
her
hostess
to
the
sofa
and
is
seated
there
as
a
mark
of
distinction
then
arrive
the
captain
and
his
wife
they
are
immediately
the
distinguished
guests
the
wife
is
shown
to
the
sofa
and
the
lieutenant
little
frau
must
get
herself
out
of
the
way
as
best
she
can
my
speculation
often
indulged
in
as
to
what
would
happen
if
the
major
wife
did
not
move
from
the
sofa
when
the
colonel
wife
appeared
ended
in
assurance
that
a
severe
punishment
would
be
meted
out
to
her
when
i
heard
from
an
officer
the
story
of
the
way
his
regiment
dealt
with
a
woman
who
ignored
another
bit
of
military
etiquette
a
débutant
once
honored
by
being
asked
to
dance
with
an
officer
at
a
ball
must
never
it
seems
demean
herself
by
accepting
a
civilian
partner
but
in
a
town
where
my
friend
regiment
was
stationed
a
very
pretty
and
popular
young
girl
who
had
been
taken
so
to
speak
to
the
bosom
of
the
regiment
danced
one
night
at
the
kurhaus
early
in
the
summer
season
with
a
civilian
distinguished
undeniably
but
unmistakably
civilian
the
officers
of
the
regiment
met
weighed
the
mighty
question
of
the
girl
offense
and
solemnly
resolved
never
again
to
ask
the
culprit
for
a
dance
i
protested
at
the
cruelty
of
a
body
of
men
deliberately
turning
a
pretty
young
thing
into
a
for
an
entire
season
the
officer
took
my
protest
as
an
added
reason
for
congratulation
upon
their
conduct
they
meant
to
be
cruel
my
words
proved
how
well
they
had
succeeded
another
little
straw
showing
the
set
of
the
wind
we
were
sitting
four
americans
one
lovely
early
summer
day
in
a
restaurant
at
swinemünde
we
had
the
window
open
looking
out
over
the
sea
at
the
next
table
were
some
officers
one
of
whom
with
an
es
zieht
but
not
with
a
by
your
leave
came
over
to
our
table
and
shut
the
window
with
a
bang
the
gentleman
with
us
asked
if
we
wanted
the
window
closed
and
on
being
assured
we
did
not
quietly
rose
and
opened
it
again
no
one
who
does
not
know
prussia
can
imagine
the
threatening
atmosphere
which
filled
that
café
we
met
the
officers
the
same
night
at
the
kurhaus
dance
they
were
introduced
and
almost
immediately
one
of
them
brought
up
the
window
incident
and
said
most
impressively
that
if
ladies
had
not
been
at
the
table
our
escort
would
have
been
called
out
we
could
see
they
regarded
us
as
unworthy
of
being
even
transient
participants
of
kultur
when
we
opined
that
no
american
man
would
accept
a
challenge
and
if
so
unwise
as
to
do
so
his
womenfolk
would
lock
him
up
until
he
reached
a
sounder
judgment
the
swords
rattled
in
their
sabres
when
the
frivolous
member
of
our
party
said
with
a
tone
of
finality
you
see
we
like
our
men
faces
to
look
as
if
they
had
got
into
their
chopping
bowls
although
i
had
often
lived
months
on
end
with
all
these
petty
tyrannies
of
the
mailed
fist
and
although
life
had
taught
me
later
that
peoples
grow
by
what
they
feed
upon
yet
when
i
read
the
bryce
report
german
frightfulness
seemed
too
inhuman
for
belief
while
still
holding
my
judgment
in
reserve
i
met
an
intimate
friend
a
prussian
officer
he
happened
to
mention
letters
he
had
received
from
his
relatives
in
berlin
and
at
the
front
and
when
i
expressed
a
wish
to
hear
them
kindly
asked
whether
he
should
translate
them
or
read
them
in
german
as
they
stood
laughingly
i
ventured
on
the
german
saying
i
would
at
least
find
out
how
much
i
had
forgotten
so
i
sat
and
listened
with
ears
pricked
up
some
of
the
letters
were
from
women
folk
and
told
of
war
conditions
in
the
capital
they
were
interesting
at
the
time
but
not
worth
repeating
now
then
came
a
letter
from
a
nephew
a
lieutenant
he
gave
his
experience
in
crossing
belgium
told
how
in
one
village
his
men
asked
a
young
woman
with
her
tiny
baby
on
her
arm
for
water
how
she
answered
resentfully
and
then
how
he
shot
her
and
her
baby
i
exclaimed
thinking
i
had
lost
the
thread
of
the
letter
not
the
baby
and
the
man
i
supposed
i
knew
as
civilized
replied
with
a
cruel
smile
yes
discipline
that
was
frank
frank
as
a
child
would
have
been
with
no
realization
of
the
of
it
the
young
officer
did
the
deed
wrote
of
it
to
his
uncle
and
the
uncle
without
vision
and
understanding
perverted
by
his
training
did
not
feel
shame
and
bury
the
secret
in
his
own
heart
but
treasured
the
evidence
against
his
own
nephew
and
laid
it
open
before
an
american
woman
i
believed
the
bryce
report
every
word
of
it
and
i
hate
the
system
that
has
so
bent
and
crippled
a
great
race
revenge
we
must
not
feel
that
would
be
to
innoculate
ourselves
with
the
enemy
virus
but
let
us
be
awake
to
the
fact
that
might
making
right
cuts
athwart
our
ideals
german
kultur
through
worship
of
efficiency
cramps
originality
and
initiative
while
our
aim
why
not
be
frank
about
it
is
the
protection
of
inefficiency
which
means
sympathy
with
childhood
and
opportunity
for
the
spirit
of
art
german
kultur
fixes
an
inflexible
limit
to
the
aspirations
of
women
while
our
goal
is
complete
freedom
for
the
mothers
of
men
the
women
of
the

can
fight
for
all
that
their

fight
for

of

for
the
sacredness
of
international
agreements
for
the
rights
of
small
nations
for
the
security
of

and
then
our
women
can
be
inspired
by
one
thing
more
the

of
all
those

which
they

whether

or

we
can
only
get
our

desire
by
toil
where
are
the
workers
who
will
win
the

we
are
a
bit
spoiled
in
the
united
states
we
have
been
accustomed
to
rub
our
aladdin
lamp
of
opportunity
and
the
good
genii
have
sent
us
workers
but
suddenly
no
matter
how
great
our
efforts
no
one
answers
our
appeal
the
reservoir
of
immigrant
labor
has
run
dry
we
are
in
sorry
plight
for
we
have
suffered
from
emigration
too
thousands
of
alien
workers
have
been
called
back
to
serve
in
the
armies
of
the
allies
in
my
own
little
village
on
long
island
the
industrious
italian
colony
was
broken
up
by
the
call
to
return
to
the
colors
in
piedmont
then
too
while
europe
suffers
loss
of
labor
as
do
we
when
men
are
mobilized
our
situation
is
peculiarly
poignant
for
when
our
armies
are
gone
they
are
gone
at
first
this
was
true
in
europe
men
entered
the
army
and
were
employed
as
soldiers
only
after
a
time
it
was
realized
that
the
war
would
not
be
short
that
fields
must
not
lie
untilled
for
years
nor
men
undergo
the
deteriorating
effects
of
trench
warfare
continuously
the
fallow
field
and
the
stale
soldier
were
brought
together
we
have
all
chanced
on
photographs
of
european
soldiers
helping
the
women
plough
in
springtime
and
reap
the
harvest
in
the
autumn
perhaps
we
have
regarded
the
scene
as
a
mere
pastoral
episode
in
a
happy
leave
from
the
battle
front
instead
of
realizing
that
it
is
a
snapshot
illustrating
a
well
organized
plan
of
securing
labor
the
soldiers
are
given
a
furlough
and
are
sent
where
the
agricultural
need
is
pressing
but
the
american
soldier
will
not
be
able
to
lend
his
skill
in
giving
the
home
fields
a
rich
seed
time
and
harvest
the
two
needs
the
field
for
the
touch
of
the
human
hand
and
the
soldier
for
labor
under
calm
skies
can
not
in
our
case
be
coördinated
scarcity
of
labor
is
not
only
certain
to
grow
but
the
demands
upon
the
united
states
for
service
are
increasing
by
leaps
and
bounds
america
must
throw
into
the
trenches
must
feed
herself
must
contribute
more
and
ever
more
food
to
the
hungry
populations
of
europe
must
meet
the
old
industrial
obligations
and
respond
to
a
whole
range
of
new
business
requirements
and
she
is
called
upon
for
this
effort
at
a
time
when
national
prosperity
is
already
making
full
use
of
when
europe
went
to
war
the
world
had
been
suffering
from
depression
a
year
and
more
immediately
on
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
whole
lines
of
business
shut
down
unemployment
became
serious
there
were
idle
hands
everywhere
germany
of
all
the
belligerents
rallied
most
quickly
to
meet
war
conditions
unemployment
gave
place
to
a
shortage
of
labor
sooner
there
than
elsewhere
great
britain
did
not
begin
to
get
the
pace
until
the
middle
of
the
business
situation
in
the
united
states
upon
its
entrance
into
the
war
was
the
antithesis
of
this
for
over
a
year
depression
had
been
superseded
by
increased
industry
high
wages
and
greater
demand
for
labor
the
country
as
measured
by
the
ordinary
financial
signs
by
its
commerce
by
its
labor
market
was
more
prosperous
than
it
had
been
for
years
tremendous
requisitions
were
being
made
upon
us
by
europe
and
to
the
limit
of
available
labor
we
were
answering
them
then
into
our
economic
life
with
industrial
forces
already
working
at
high
pressure
were
injected
the
new
demands
arising
from
changing
the
united
states
from
a
people
as
unprepared
for
effective
hostilities
as
a
baby
in
its
cradle
into
a
nation
equipped
for
war
there
was
no
unemployment
but
on
the
contrary
shortage
of
labor
the
country
calls
for
everything
and
all
at
once
like
the
spoiled
child
on
suddenly
waking
it
must
have
and
without
delay
ships
coal
cars
cantonments
uniforms
rules
and
food
food
food
how
can
the
needs
be
supplied
and
with
a
million
and
a
half
of
men
dropping
work
besides
by
or
coolie
labor
those
are
the
horns
of
the
dilemma
presented
to
puzzled
america
the
senate
of
the
united
states
directs
its
committee
of
agriculture
to
ponder
well
the
coolie
problem
for
men
hesitate
to
have
women
put
their
shoulder
to
the
wheel
trade
unionists
are
right
in
urging
that
a
republic
has
no
place
for
a
disfranchised
class
of
imported
toilers
equally
true
is
it
that
as
a
nation
we
have
shown
no
gift
for
dealing
with
less
developed
races
and
yet
labor
we
must
have
will
american
women
supply
it
will
they
loving
ease
favor
contract
labor
from
the
outside
or
will
they
accept
the
optimistic
view
that
lack
of
labor
is
not
acute
the
procrastinator
queries
can
not
american
meet
the
demand
it
can
for
a
time
perhaps
if
the
draft
for
the
army
goes
as
slowly
in
the
future
as
it
has
in
the
past
however
at
any
moment
a
full
realization
may
come
to
us
of
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
while
the
united
states
is
putting
only
three
percent
of
its
workers
into
the
fighting
forces
great
britain
has
put
percent
and
is
now
combing
its
industrial
army
over
to
find
an
additional
five
hundred
thousand
men
to
throw
on
the
french
front
it
is
probable
that
it
will
be
felt
by
this
country
in
the
near
future
that
such
a
contrast
of
fulfillment
of
obligation
can
not
continue
without
serious
reflection
on
our
national
honor
roughly
speaking
great
britain
has
twenty
million
persons
in
gainful
pursuits
of
these
five
million
have
already
been
taken
for
the
army
the
contribution
of
france
is
still
greater
her
military
force
has
reached
the
appalling
proportion
of
of
her
entire
population
but
we
who
have
million
in
gainful
occupations
are
giving
a
paltry
one
million
five
hundred
thousand
in
service
with
our
allies
the
situation
is
not
creditable
to
us
and
one
of
the
things
which
stands
in
the
way
of
the
united
states
reaching
a
more
worthy
position
is
reluctance
to
see
its
women
shouldering
economic
burdens
illustration
they
wear
the
uniforms
of
the
edinburgh
trams
and
the
new
york
city
subway
and
trolley
guards
with
pride
and
purpose
while
it
is
quite
true
that
shifting
of
is
needed
mere
shuffling
of
the
cards
as
labor
leaders
suggest
wo
give
a
bigger
pack
cards
it
remains
though
the
jack
may
be
put
into
a
more
suitable
position
the
man
behind
the
counter
should
of
course
be
moved
to
a
muscular
employment
but
we
must
not
interpret
his
dalliance
with
tapes
and
ribbons
as
proof
of
a
superfluity
of
men
the
latest
reports
of
the
new
york
state
department
of
labor
reflect
the
meagerness
of
the
supply
here
are
some
dull
figures
to
prove
it
comparing
the
situation
with
a
year
ago
we
find
in
a
corresponding
month
only
one
percent
more
employees
this
year
with
a
wage
advance
of
seventeen
percent
drawing
the
comparison
between
this
year
and
two
years
ago
there
is
an
advance
of
fifteen
percent
in
employees
and
percent
in
wages
and
an
increase
of
thirty
percent
in
employees
and
percent
in
wages
if
this
year
is
compared
with
the
conditions
when
the
world
was
suffering
from
industrial
depression
the
state
employment
offices
report
eight
thousand
three
hundred
and
requests
for
workers
against
seven
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
applicants
for
employment
and
of
the
latter
only
percent
were
fitted
for
the
grades
of
work
open
to
them
and
were
placed
in
situations
the
last
records
of
conditions
in
the
coal
regions
confirm
the
fact
of
labor
scarcity
there
are
one
hundred
and
thousand
men
and
boys
at
work
today
in
the
anthracite
fields
thousand
less
than
the
number
employed
in
these
miners
owing
to
the
prod
of
the
highest
wages
ever
received
the
skilled
man
earning
from
forty
dollars
to
dollars
a
week
and
to
appeals
to
their
patriotism
are
individually
producing
a
larger
output
than
ever
before
it
is
considered
that
production
with
the
present
labor
force
is
at
its
maximum
and
if
a
yield
of
coal
commensurate
with
the
need
is
to
be
attained
at
least
seventy
percent
more
men
must
be
supplied
this
is
a
call
for
in
addition
to
that
suggested
by
the
fuel
administrator
to
the
effect
that
lack
of
coal
is
partly
lack
of
cars
and
that
back
of
the
transportation
shortage
lies
labor
shortage
an
order
was
sent
out
by
the
director
general
of
railways
soon
after
his
appointment
that
mechanics
from
the
repair
shops
of
the
west
were
to
be
shifted
to
the
east
to
supply
the
call
for
help
on
the
atlantic
border
suggestive
of
the
cause
of
all
this
shortage
float
the
service
flags
of
the
mining
and
railway
companies
the
hundreds
of
glowing
stars
telling
their
tale
of
men
gone
to
the
front
and
of
just
so
many
stars
torn
from
the
standards
of
the
industrial
army
at
home
the
shipping
board
recently
called
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
to
be
gradually
recruited
as
a
skilled
army
for
work
in
shipyards
at
the
same
time
the
congress
passed
an
appropriation
of
fifty
million
dollars
for
building
houses
to
accommodate
ship
labor
six
months
ago
only
fifty
thousand
men
were
employed
in
today
there
are
one
hundred
and
thousand
this
rapid
drawing
of
men
to
new
centers
creates
a
housing
problem
so
huge
that
it
must
he
met
by
the
government
and
it
need
hardly
be
pointed
out
shelter
can
be
built
only
by
human
hands
one
state
official
prompted
no
doubt
by
a
wise
hostility
to
coolie
labor
and
dread
of
woman
labor
has
gone
so
far
as
to
declare
publicly
that
any
employer
who
will
pay
adequate
wages
can
get
all
the
labor
he
requires
this
view
suggests
that
we
may
soon
have
to
adopt
the
methods
of
other
belligerents
and
stop
employers
by
law
from
stealing
a
neighbor
working
force
i
know
of
a
shipyard
with
a
normal
of
five
hundred
hands
which
in
one
year
engaged
and
lost
to
nearby
munition
factories
thirteen
thousand
laborers
such
shifting
hiding
as
it
does
shortage
of
manpower
leads
to
serious
loss
in
our
productive
efficiency
and
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
unchecked
the
manager
of
one
of
the
new
york
city
street
railways
met
with
complete
denial
the
easy
optimism
that
adequate
remuneration
will
command
a
sufficient
supply
of
men
he
told
me
that
he
had
introduced
women
at
the
same
wage
as
male
conductors
not
because
he
wanted
women
but
because
he
now
had
only
five
applications
by
fit
men
to
thirty
or
forty
formerly
there
were
men
to
be
had
he
said
and
at
lower
wages
than
his
company
was
paying
but
they
were
not
of
the
class
capable
of
fulfilling
the
requirements
of
the
position
the
labor
administration
announced
on
its
creation
that
its
policy
would
be
to
prevent
woman
labor
in
positions
for
which
men
are
available
and
one
of
the
deputy
commissioners
of
the
industrial
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
declared
quite
frankly
at
a
labor
conference
that
if
he
could
he
would
exclude
women
from
industry
altogether
we
may
try
to
prevent
the
oncoming
tide
of
the
economic
independence
of
women
but
it
will
not
be
possible
to
force
the
business
world
to
accept
permanently
the
service
of
the
inefficient
in
place
of
that
of
the
alert
and
intelligent
to
carry
on
the
economic
life
of
a
nation
with
its
labor
flotsam
and
jetsam
is
loss
at
any
time
in
time
of
storm
and
stress
it
is
suicide
is
short
seriously
so
the
farm
is
always
the
best
barometer
to
give
warning
of
scarcity
of
labor
the
land
has
been
drained
of
its
workers
a
fair
wage
would
keep
them
on
the
farm
this
is
the
philosophy
of
laissez
faire
without
stopping
to
inquire
as
to
what
the
munition
works
would
then
do
we
can
still
see
that
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
farm
can
act
as
magnet
even
men
let
us
venture
the
suggestion
like
change
for
the
mere
sake
of
change
a
man
who
had
taken
up
work
at
bridgeport
said
to
me
i
mulled
around
on
the
farm
all
my
days
i
grabbed
the
first
chance
to
get
away
and
then
there
a
finer
spirit
prompting
the
desertion
of
the
hoe
a
man
of
gave
me
the
point
of
view
my
brother
is
there
and
i
feel
as
if
i
were
backing
him
up
by
making
guns
the
only
thing
that
can
change
the
idea
that
farming
is
mulling
around
and
making
a
gun
backs
up
the
man
at
the
front
more
thoroughly
than
raising
turnips
is
to
bring
to
the
farm
new
workers
who
realize
the
vital
part
played
by
food
in
the
winning
of
the
war
as
the
modern
industrial
system
has
developed
with
its
marvels
of
specialized
machinery
its
army
of
employees
gathered
and
dispersed
on
the
stroke
of
the
clock
and
strong
organizations
created
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
worker
the
calm
and
quiet
processes
of
agriculture
have
in
comparison
grown
colorless
the
average
farmhand
has
never
found
push
and
drive
and
group
action
on
the
farm
but
only
individualism
to
the
extreme
of
isolation
and
now
in
war
time
when
in
addition
to
its
usual
life
of
stirring
contacts
the
factory
takes
on
an
intimate
and
striking
relation
to
the
intense
experience
of
the
battle
front
the
work
of
the
farm
seems
as
flat
as
it
is
likely
to
be
unprofitable
the
man
in
the
furrow
has
no
idea
that
he
is
backing
up
the
boy
in
the
trench
the
farmer
in
his
turn
does
not
find
himself
part
of
the
wider
relations
that
attract
and
support
the
manufacturer
crops
are
not
grown
on
order
the
marketing
is
as
uncertain
as
the
weather
the
farmer
could
by
higher
wages
attract
more
labor
but
as
the
selling
of
the
harvest
remains
a
haphazard
matter
the
venture
might
mean
ruin
all
the
more
certain
and
serious
were
wage
outlay
large
in
response
to
a
call
for
food
and
an
appeal
to
his
patriotism
the
farmer
has
repeatedly
made
unusual
efforts
to
bring
his
land
to
the
maximum
fertility
only
to
find
his
crops
often
a
dead
loss
as
he
could
not
secure
the
labor
to
harvest
them
i
saw
one
summer
acres
of
garden
truck
at
its
prime
ploughed
under
in
connecticut
because
of
a
shortage
of
labor
i
saw
fruit
left
rotting
by
the
bushel
in
the
orchards
near
rochester
because
of
scarcity
of
pickers
and
a
doubt
of
the
reliability
of
the
market
the
industry
which
means
more
than
any
other
to
the
of
humanity
at
this
crisis
is
the
sport
of
methods
outgrown
and
of
servants
who
lack
understanding
and
inspiration
the
war
may
furnish
the
spark
for
the
needed
revolution
is
not
available
is
at
hand
a
new
labor
force
always
brings
ideas
and
ideals
peculiar
to
itself
may
not
women
as
fresh
recruits
in
a
land
army
stamp
their
likes
and
dislikes
on
farm
life
their
enthusiasm
may
put
staleness
to
rout
and
the
group
system
of
women
land
workers
already
tested
in
the
crucible
of
experience
may
bring
to
the
farm
the
needed
antidote
to
isolation
to
win
the
war
we
must
have
in
the
trenches
sufficient
to
win
it
with
to
win
every
soldier
every
sailor
must
be
well
fed
well
clothed
well
equipped
to
win
behind
the
armed
forces
must
stand
determined
peoples
to
win
the
people
of
america
and
her
allies
must
be
heartened
by
care
and
food
the
sun
shines
on
the
fertile
land
the
earth
teems
with
forests
with
coal
with
every
necessary
mineral
and
food
but
labor
labor
alone
can
transform
all
to
meet
our
necessities
unaided
can
not
supply
the
demand
women
in
america
must
shoulder
as
nobly
as
have
the
women
of
europe
this
duty
they
must
answer
their
country
call
let
them
see
clearly
that
the
desire
of
their
men
to
shield
them
from
possible
injury
exposes
the
nation
and
the
world
to
actual
danger
our
winning
of
the
war
depends
upon
the
full
use
of
the
energy
of
our
entire
people
every
muscle
every
brain
must
be
mobilized
if
the
national
aim
is
to
be
achieved
iii
mobilizing
women
in
great
britain
in
no
country
have
women
reached
a
mobilization
so
complete
and
systematized
as
in
great
britain
this
mobilization
covers
the
whole
field
of
war
service
in
industry
business
and
professional
life
and
in
government
administration
women
serve
on
the
ministry
of
food
and
are
included
in
the
membership
of
of
the
important
government
committees
not
auxiliary
or
advisory
but
administrative
committees
such
as
those
on
war
pensions
on
disabled
officers
and
men
on
education
after
the
war
and
the
labor
commission
to
deal
with
industrial
unrest
in
short
the
women
of
great
britain
are
working
side
by
side
with
men
in
the
initiation
and
execution
of
plans
to
solve
the
problems
which
confront
the
nation
four
committees
as
for
instance
those
making
investigations
and
recommendations
on
women
wages
and
drink
among
women
are
entirely
composed
of
women
and
great
departments
such
as
the
women
land
army
the
women
army
auxiliary
corps
are
officered
throughout
by
them
hospitals
under
the
war
office
have
been
placed
in
complete
control
of
medical
women
they
take
rank
with
medical
men
in
the
army
and
receive
the
pay
going
with
their
commissions
when
great
britain
recognized
that
the
war
could
not
be
won
by
merely
sending
splendid
fighters
to
the
front
and
meeting
the
wastage
by
steady
drafts
upon
the
manhood
of
the
country
she
began
to
build
an
efficient
organization
of
industry
at
home
to
the
call
for
british
women
gave
instant
response
in
munitions
a
million
are
mobilized
in
the
land
army
there
have
been
drafted
and
actually
placed
on
the
farms
over
three
hundred
thousand
and
in
the
women
army
auxiliary
corps
fourteen
thousand
women
are
working
in
direct
connection
with
the
fighting
force
and
an
additional
ten
thousand
are
being
called
out
for
service
each
month
in
the
clerical
force
of
the
government
departments
some
of
which
had
never
seen
women
before
in
their
sacred
precincts
over
one
hundred
and
thousand
are
now
working
and
the
women
civil
servants
are
not
only
engaged
in
indoor
service
but
outside
too
most
of
the
carrying
of
mail
being
in
their
hands
women
are
some
seven
thousand
strong
four
thousand
act
as
patrols
and
police
forty
thousand
are
in
banks
and
various
financial
houses
it
is
said
that
there
are
in
great
britain
scarce
a
million
women
and
they
are
mostly
occupied
as
housewives
who
could
render
greater
service
to
their
country
than
that
which
they
are
now
giving
the
wide
inclusion
of
women
in
government
administration
is
very
striking
to
us
in
america
but
we
must
not
forget
that
the
contrast
between
the
two
countries
in
the
participation
of
women
in
political
life
and
public
service
has
always
been
great
the
women
of
the
united
kingdom
have
enjoyed
the
municipal
and
county
franchise
for
years
for
a
long
time
large
numbers
of
women
have
been
called
to
administrative
positions
they
have
had
thorough
training
in
government
as
poor
law
guardians
district
and
county
councilors
members
of
school
boards
no
women
the
whole
world
over
are
equipped
as
those
of
great
britain
for
service
to
the
state
in
the
glamor
of
the
extremely
striking
government
service
of
british
women
we
must
not
overlook
their
organizations
perhaps
these
offer
the
most
valuable
suggestions
for
america
they
are
near
enough
to
our
experience
to
be
quite
understandable
the
mother
country
is
not
under
regimentation
originality
and
initiative
have
full
play
perhaps
it
was
well
that
the
government
failed
to
appreciate
what
women
could
do
and
neglected
them
so
long
most
of
the
effective
work
was
started
in
volunteer
societies
and
had
proved
a
success
before
there
was
an
official
laying
on
of
hands
it
is
our
strong
point
always
work
from
below
up
a
glance
at
any
account
of
the
mobilization
of
in
great
britain
miss
fraser
admirable
women
and
war
work
for
instance
will
reveal
the
printed
page
dotted
thick
with
the
names
of
volunteer
associations
a
woman
with
sympathy
sees
a
need
she
gets
an
idea
and
calls
others
about
her
quickly
there
being
no
red
tape
the
need
begins
to
be
met
what
more
admirable
service
could
have
been
performed
than
that
inaugurated
in
the
early
months
of
the
war
under
the
work
for
women
fund
when
work
was
secured
for
the
women
in
luxury
trades
which
were
collapsing
under
war
pressure
a
hundred
and
thirty
firms
employing
women
were
kept
running
what
more
thrilling
example
of
courage
and
forethought
has
been
shown
than
by
the
scottish
women
hospitals
in
putting
on
the
western
front
the
first
car
to
move
from
point
to
point
near
the
lines
it
but
adds
to
the
appeal
of
the
work
that
those
great
scientists
ayrton
and
madame
curie
selected
the
equipment
it
was
a
body
the
national
union
of
women
suffrage
societies
which
opened
before
the
war
was
two
weeks
old
the
service
bureau
and
soon
placed
forty
thousand
women
as
paid
and
volunteer
workers
it
was
this
bureau
that
furnished
the
government
with
its
supervisors
for
the
arsenals
the
women
farm
and
garden
union
was
the
of
the
official
land
army
and
to
it
still
is
left
the
important
work
of
enrolling
those
women
who
while
willing
to
undertake
agricultural
work
are
disinclined
to
sign
up
for
service
for
the
duration
of
the
war
not
only
have
unnumbered
voluntary
associations
achieved
miracles
in
necessary
work
but
many
of
them
have
gained
untold
discipline
in
the
ridicule
they
have
had
to
endure
from
a
doubting
public
i
remember
hunting
in
vain
all
about
oxford
circus
for
the
office
of
the
women
signalling
corps
my
inquiries
only
made
the
london
bobbies
grin
everyone
laughed
at
the
idea
of
women
signalling
but
the
members
are
recognized
officially
one
holding
an
important
appointment
in
the
college
of
wireless
telegraphy
how
scotland
yard
smiled
at
first
at
miss
damer
dawson
and
her
women
police
service
but
now
the
metropolitan
police
are
calling
for
the
help
of
her
splendidly
trained
and
reliable
force
and
the
women
reserve
ambulance
corps
i
climbed
and
climbed
to
an
attic
to
visit
their
headquarters
there
was
the
commandant
in
her
khaki
very
gracious
but
very
upstanding
and
maintaining
the
strictest
discipline
no
member
of
the
corps
entered
or
left
her
office
without
clapping
heels
together
and
saluting
the
ambulance
about
which
the
corps
revolved
i
often
met
in
the
streets
empty
but
those
women
had
vision
they
saw
that
england
would
need
them
some
day
they
had
faith
in
their
ability
to
serve
so
on
and
on
they
went
training
themselves
to
higher
efficiency
in
body
and
mind
and
well
theirs
is
always
the
first
ambulance
on
the
spot
to
care
for
the
injured
in
the
the
scoffers
have
remained
to
pray
if
britain
has
a
lesson
for
us
it
is
an
to
societies
an
encouragement
to
every
idea
a
blessing
on
every
effort
which
has
behind
it
honesty
of
purpose
great
britain
activities
are
as
refreshingly
diversified
as
her
talents
they
are
not
all
under
one
hat
in
the
training
for
new
industrial
openings
this
same
spirit
of
service
showed
itself
in
munitions
for
instance
private
employers
were
the
first
to
recognize
that
they
had
in
a
labor
force
worth
the
cost
of
training
the
best
of
the
skilled
men
in
many
cases
were
told
off
to
give
the
necessary
instruction
the
will
to
do
was
in
the
learner
she
soon
mastered
even
complex
processes
and
at
the
end
of
a
few
weeks
was
doing
even
better
than
men
in
the
light
work
and
achieving
commendable
output
in
the
heavy
the
suffrage
organizations
whenever
a
new
line
of
skilled
work
was
opened
to
women
established
centers
to
give
the
necessary
teaching
not
until
it
became
apparent
that
the
new
only
needed
training
to
reach
a
high
grade
of
proficiency
did
county
councils
establish
at
government
expense
technical
classes
for
girls
and
women
illustration
then
the
offered
service
of
the
women
reserve
ambulance
corps
in
england
was
spurned
now
they
wear
shrapnel
helmets
while
working
during
the
zeppelin
raids
equipment
of
the
army
was
obviously
the
first
and
pressing
obligation
fields
might
lie
fallow
for
food
in
the
early
days
could
easily
be
brought
from
abroad
but
men
had
to
be
registered
soldiers
clothed
and
equipped
it
was
natural
then
that
the
new
workers
were
principally
used
in
registration
work
and
in
making
military
supplies
but
in
the
second
year
of
the
war
came
the
conviction
that
the
contest
was
not
soon
to
be
ended
and
that
the
matter
of
raising
food
at
home
must
be
met
women
were
again
appealed
to
a
land
army
mobilized
by
women
was
created
at
first
this
work
was
carried
on
under
a
centralized
division
of
the
national
service
department
but
there
has
been
decentralization
and
the
land
army
is
now
a
department
of
the
board
of
agriculture
it
is
headed
by
miss
talbot
as
director
under
this
central
body
are
women
agricultural
committees
in
each
county
with
an
organizing
secretary
whose
duty
it
is
to
secure
recruits
the
workers
in
a
locality
are
obtained
by
the
wife
of
the
squire
or
vicar
acting
as
a
volunteer
registrar
many
of
these
workers
register
to
do
the
domestic
work
of
the
lusty
young
village
housewife
or
mother
while
she
is
absent
from
home
performing
her
allotted
task
on
a
nearby
farm
the
recruits
are
not
only
secured
by
the
organizers
but
through
registrations
at
every
post
office
any
woman
can
ask
for
a
registration
card
and
fill
it
out
and
the
postmaster
then
forwards
the
application
to
the
committee
the
next
step
is
that
likely
applicants
are
called
to
the
nearest
center
for
examination
and
presentation
of
credentials
when
finally
accepted
they
are
usually
sent
for
six
weeks
or
three
months
training
to
a
farm
belonging
to
some
large
estate
the
landlord
contributes
the
training
and
the
government
gives
the
recruit
her
uniform
and
fifteen
shillings
a
week
to
cover
her
board
and
lodging
at
the
end
of
her
course

no

the

of

they

every
kind

let
us
not

supplant
a

but
rather
set
a
man
free
for
fuller
service
my
niece
a
slip
of
a
girl
felt
the
call
of
duty
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
her
brothers
were
early
volunteers
in
kitchener
army
they
were
in
the
trenches
and
she
longed
for
the
sensation
of
bearing
a
burden
of
hard
work
she
went
to
woolwich
arsenal
and
toiled
twelve
hours
a
day
she
broke
under
the
strain
recuperated
and
took
up
munition
work
again
she
became
expert
and
was
in
time
an
overseer
told
off
to
train
other
women
but
she
was
never
satisfied
and
always
anxious
to
be
nearer
the
great
struggle
she
broke
away
one
day
and
went
to
southampton
for
a
waac
examination
and
found
herself
one
of
a
group
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
gentlewomen
all
anxious
to
enter
active
service
and
all
prepared
for
some
definite
work
they
stood
their
tests
and
dolly
that
the
little
niece
pet
name
given
to
her
because
she
is
so
tiny
is
now
working
as
an
engine
fitter
just
behind
the
fighting
lines
dainty
dolly
whom
we
have
always
treated
as
a
fragile
bit
of
sèvres
china
clad
in
breeches
and
puttees
under
the
booming
of
the
great
guns
is
fitting
patiently
part
to
part
the
beating
engine
which
will
lift
on
wings
some
english
boy
in
his
flight
through
the
blue
skies
of
france
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
magnificent
service
of
british
women
devoted
efficient
and
from
top
to
bottom
realized
itself
without
friction
any
more
than
it
will
here
there
were
certainly
two
wars
going
on
in
great
britain
for
a
long
time
and
the
internal
strife
was
little
less
bitter
than
the
international
conflict
the
most
active
center
of
this
contest
of
which
we
have
heard
so
little
was
in
industry
and
the
combatants
were
the
government
trade
unions
and
women
the
unions
were
doing
battle
because
of
fear
of
unskilled
workers
especially
when
intelligent
and
easily
trained
the
government
in
sore
need
of
munition
hands
was
bargaining
with
the
unskilled
for
long
hours
and
low
pay
finally
the
government
and
the
unions
reluctantly
agreed
that
women
must
be
employed
both
wanted
them
to
be
skillful
but
not
too
skillful
and
above
all
to
remain
amenable
it
has
been
made
clear
too
that
women
enter
their
new
positions
for
the
war
only
at
the
end
of
hostilities
international
hostilities
women
are
to
hand
over
their
work
and
wages
to
men
and
go
home
and
be
content
will
the
program
be
fulfilled
the
wishes
of
women
themselves
may
play
some
part
how
do
they
feel
obviously
every
day
the
war
lasts
they
get
wider
experience
of
the
sorrows
and
pleasures
of
financial
independence
women
are
called
the
practical
sex
and
i
certainly
found
them
in
england
facing
the
fact
that
peace
will
mean
an
insufficient
number
of
breadwinners
to
go
around
and
that
a
maimed
man
may
have
low
earning
power
the
women
i
met
were
not
dejected
at
the
prospect
they
showed
on
the
contrary
a
spirit
not
far
removed
from
elation
in
finding
new
opportunities
of
service
after
i
had
sat
and
listened
to
speech
after
speech
at
the
annual
conference
of
the
national
union
of
women
workers
with
delegates
from
all
parts
of
the
country
presided
over
by
creighton
widow
of
the
late
bishop
of
london
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
british
women
desired
to
enter
paid
fields
of
work
and
regarded
as
permanent
the
great
increase
in
their
employment
no
regrets
or
hesitations
were
expressed
in
a
single
speech
and
the
solutions
of
the
problems
inherent
in
the
new
situation
all
lay
in
the
direction
of
equality
of
preparation
and
equality
of
pay
with
men
the
strongest
element
in
the
women
trade
unions
takes
the
same
stand
the
great
rise
in
the
employment
of
women
is
not
regarded
as
a
war
measure
and
all
the
suggestions
made
to
meet
the
hardships
of
readjustment
such
as
a
minimum
wage
for
all
unskilled
workers
men
as
well
as
women
are
based
on
the
idea
of
the
new
workers
being
permanent
factors
in
the
labor
market
the
same
conclusion
was
reached
in
the
report
presented
to
the
british
association
by
the
committee
appointed
to
investigate
the
replacement
of
male
by
female
labor
the
committee
found
itself
in
entire
disagreement
with
the
opinion
that
the
increased
employment
of
women
was
a
passing
phase
and
made
recommendations
bearing
on
such
measures
as
improved
technical
training
for
girls
as
well
as
for
boys
a
minimum
wage
for
unskilled
men
as
well
as
women
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
the
abolition
of
but
while
it
was
obvious
that
the
greatest
asset
of
belligerent
nations
is
the
labor
of
women
while
learned
societies
and
organizations
of
women
laid
down
rules
for
their
safe
and
permanent
employment
the
british
government
showed
marked
opposition
to
the
new
workers
if
the
cabinet
did
not
believe
the
war
would
be
brief
it
certainly
acted
as
if
great
britain
alone
among
the
belligerents
would
have
no
shortage
of
male
industrial
hands
at
a
time
when
germany
had
five
hundred
thousand
women
in
munition
factories
england
had
but
ten
thousand
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
country
was
at
first
organized
merely
for
a
spurt
boys
and
girls
were
pressed
into
service
wages
were
cut
down
for
women
hours
lengthened
for
men
government
reports
read
like
the
shaftesbury
attacks
on
the
conditions
of
early
factory
days
we
hear
again
of
beds
that
are
never
cold
the
occupant
of
one
shift
succeeding
the
occupant
of
the
next
of
the
boy
sleeping
in
the
same
bed
with
two
men
and
three
girls
in
a
cot
in
the
same
room
labor
unrest
was
met
at
first
by
the
munitions
war
act
prohibiting
strikes
and
lockouts
establishing
compulsory
arbitration
and
suspending
all
rules
which
might
hamper
production
under
the
law
a
voluntary
army
of
workers
signed
up
as
ready
to
go
anywhere
their
labor
was
needed
and
local
munition
committees
became
labor
courts
endowed
with
power
to
change
wage
rates
to
inflict
fines
on
slackers
and
on
those
who
broke
the
agreements
of
the
voluntary
army
to
meet
the
threatening
rebellion
a
health
of
munition
workers
committee
under
the
ministry
of
munitions
was
appointed
to
consider
and
advise
on
questions
of
industrial
fatigue
hours
of
labor
and
other
matters
affecting
the
physical
health
and
physical
efficiency
of
workers
in
munition
factories
and
workshops
on
this
committee
there
were
distinguished
medical
men
labor
experts
members
of
parliament
and
two
women
miss
squire
of
the
factory
department
and
tennant
the
committee
was
guided
by
a
desire
to
have
immense
quantities
of
munitions
turned
out
and
faced
squarely
the
probability
that
the
war
would
be
of
long
duration
its
findings
embodied
in
a
series
of
memoranda
have
lessons
for
us
not
only
for
war
times
but
for
peace
times
for
all
time
on
a
seven
day
week
the
verdict
was
that
if
the
maximum
output
is
to
be
secured
and
maintained
for
any
length
of
time
a
weekly
period
of
rest
must
be
allowed
overtime
was
advised
against
a
double
or
triple
shift
being
recommended
in
july
the
committee
published
a
most
interesting
memorandum
on
experiments
in
the
relation
of
output
to
hours
in
one
case
the
output
was
increased
eight
percent
by
reducing
the
weekly
hours
from
to
and
it
was
found
that
a
decrease
to
hours
per
week
gave
the
same
output
as
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
there
was
no
change
in
machinery
tools
raw
material
or
workers
all
elements
except
hours
of
work
were
identical
workers
doing
very
heavy
work
increased
their
output
ten
percent
by
cutting
weekly
hours
from
to
in
a
munition
plant
employing
thousand
hands
it
was
found
that
the
sick
rate
ranged
from
five
to
eight
percent
when
the
employees
were
working
overtime
and
was
only
three
percent
when
they
were
on
a
double
shift
the
war
has
forced
great
britain
to
carry
out
the
findings
of
this
committee
and
to
consider
more
seriously
than
ever
before
and
for
both
men
and
women
the
problem
of
industrial
fatigue
the
relation
of
accidents
to
hours
of
labor
industrial
diseases
housing
transit
and
industrial
canteens
the
munition
worker
is
as
important
as
the
soldier
and
must
have
the
best
of
care
while
the
friction
in
the
ranks
of
industrial
women
workers
was
still
far
from
being
adjusted
the
government
met
its
waterloo
in
the
contest
with
medical
women
the
service
which
they
freely
offered
their
country
was
at
first
sternly
refused
undaunted
they
sought
recognition
outside
the
mother
country
they
knew
their
skill
and
they
knew
the
need
they
turned
to
hospitable
france
and
received
official
recognition
on
december
the
first
hospital
at
the
front
under
british
medical
women
was
opened
in
abbaye
royaumont
near
creil
it
carries
the
official
designation
hôpital
auxiliaire
the
doctors
the
nurses
the
cooks
are
all
women
one
of
the
capable
chauffeurs
i
saw
running
the
ambulance
when
i
was
in
creil
she
was
getting
the
wounded
as
they
came
down
from
the
front
the
french
government
appreciated
what
the
women
were
doing
and
urged
them
to
give
more
help
at
troyes
another
unit
gave
the
french
army
its
first
experience
of
nursing
under
canvas
after
france
had
been
profiting
by
the
skill
of
british
women
for
months
sir
alfred
keogh
medical
director
general
wisely
insisted
that
the
war
office
yield
and
place
a
hospital
in
the
hands
of
women
the
war
hospital
in
endell
street
london
is
now
under
flora
murray
and
every
office
except
that
of
gateman
is
filled
by
women
from
the
doctors
who
rank
as
majors
down
to
the
cooks
who
rank
as
officers
every
one
connected
with
endell
street
has
military
standing
it
indicated
the
long
hard
road
these
women
had
traveled
to
secure
official
recognition
that
the
doctor
who
showed
me
over
the
hospital
told
me
as
a
matter
for
congratulation
that
at
night
the
police
brought
in
drunken
soldiers
to
be
sobered
every
war
hospital
must
receive
them
she
explained
and
we
are
glad
we
are
not
passed
over
for
that
gives
the
stamp
to
our
official
standing
it
was
a
beautiful
autumn
day
when
i
visited
endell
street
the
great
court
was
full
of
convalescents
and
the
orderlies
in
khaki
with
veils
floating
back
from
their
toques
were
carefully
and
skillfully
lifting
the
wounded
from
an
ambulance
i
spoke
to
one
of
the
soldier
boys
about
the
absence
of
men
doctors
and
orderlies
and
his
quick
query
was
and
what
should
we
want
men
for
it
seems
that
they
always
take
that
stand
after
a
day
or
two
at
first
the
patient
is
puzzled
he
calls
the
doctor
sister
and
the
orderly
nurse
but
ends
by
being
an
enthusiastic
champion
of
the
new
order
not
a
misogynist
did
i
find
one
poor
fellow
who
had
been
wounded
again
and
again
and
had
been
in
many
hospitals
declared
i
do
mean
no
flattery
but
this
place
leaves
nothink
wanting
the
first
woman
i
met
on
my
last
visit
to
england
upset
my
expectation
of
finding
that
war
pushed
women
back
into
primitive
conditions
of
toil
crushed
them
under
the
idea
that
physical
force
rules
the
world
and
made
them
subservient
i
chanced
upon
her
as
she
was
acting
as
at
the
yarmouth
station
she
was
well
alert
efficient
helpful
in
giving
information
and
above
all
cheerful
there
were
two
capable
young
women
at
the
bookstall
too
one
had
lost
a
brother
at
the
front
the
other
her
lover
i
felt
that
they
regarded
their
loss
as
one
item
in
the
big
national
accounting
they
were
heroically
cheerful
in
doing
their
bit
throughout
my
stay
in
england
i
searched
for
but
could
not
find
the
spinster
of
former
days
in
her
place
was
a
capable
woman
happy
she
was
occupied
and
bustled
at
her
work
she
jumped
on
and
off
moving
vehicles
with
the
alertness
if
not
the
unconsciousness
of
the
expert
male
she
never
let
me
stand
in
omnibus
or
subway
but
quickly
gave
me
her
seat
as
indeed
she
insisted
upon
doing
for
elderly
gentlemen
as
well
the
british
woman
had
found
herself
and
her
muscles
england
was
a
world
of
women
women
in
uniforms
there
was
the
army
of
nurses
and
then
the
messengers
porters
elevator
hands
tram
conductors
bank
clerks
bookkeepers
shop
attendants
they
each
seemed
to
challenge
the
humble
stranger
superfluous
not
i
i
a
recruit
for
national
service
even
a
woman
doing
womanly
work
moved
with
an
air
of
distinction
she
dusted
a
room
for
the
good
of
her
country
just
one
glimpse
was
i
given
of
the
daughter
of
eve
when
a
at
reading
said
i
ca
punch
your
ticket
do
you
see
i
eating
an
apple
one
of
the
reactions
of
the
wider
functioning
of
brain
and
muscle
which
struck
me
most
forcibly
was
the
increased
joyfulness
of
women
they
were
happy
in
their
work
happy
in
the
thought
of
rendering
service
so
happy
that
the
poignancy
of
individual
loss
was
carried
more
easily
this
cheerfulness
is
somewhat
gruesomely
voiced
in
a
cartoon
in
touching
on
the
allowance
given
to
the
soldier
wife
she
remarks
this
war
is
shillings
a
week
and
no
bothering
about
we
have
always
credited
with
knowing
england
truth
stands
revealed
by
a
thrust
however
cynical
when
softened
by
challenging
humor
there
was
no
discipline
in
the
pension
system
no
work
was
required
the
case
of
a
girl
i
met
in
a
country
town
was
common
she
was
working
in
a
factory
earning
eleven
shillings
a
week
a
day
or
two
later
i
saw
her
and
she
told
me
she
had
stopped
work
as
she
had
married
a
soldier
and
gone
to
france
and
i
get
twelve
and
six
separation
allowance
a
week
never
did
the
strange
english
name
separation
allowance
seem
more
appropriate
for
the
wife
pension
than
in
this
girl
story
little
wonder
was
it
that
in
the
early
months
of
the
war
there
was
some
riotous
living
among
soldiers
wives
and
the
comments
of
women
of
influence
on
the
drunkenness
and
waste
of
money
on
foolish
finery
were
as
striking
to
me
as
the
sordid
condition
itself
the
woman
chairman
of
a
board
of
poor
law
guardians
in
the
north
of
england
told
me
that
when
her
suggested
that
parliament
ought
to
appoint
committees
to
disburse
the
separation
allowances
she
opposed
them
with
the
heroic
philosophy
that
women
can
be
trained
in
wisdom
only
by
freedom
to
err
that
a
sense
of
responsibility
had
never
been
cultivated
in
them
and
the
country
would
have
to
bear
the
consequences
in
reply
to
my
inquiry
as
to
how
the
guardians
received
these
theories
i
learned
that
they
knew
she
was
right
and
dropped
their
plan
the
faith
of
leading
women
that
experience
would
be
the
best
teacher
for
the
soldier
wife
has
been
justified
a
labor
leader
in
the
midlands
told
me
that
an
investigation
by
his
trade
union
showed
that
only
one
hundred
women
in
the
ten
thousand
cases
inquired
into
were
their
allowances
and
when
i
was
visiting
a
board
school
in
a
poor
district
of
london
and
remarked
to
the
head
teacher
that
the
children
looked
well
cared
for
she
told
me
that
never
had
they
been
so
well
fed
and
clothed
there
seemed
no
doubt
in
her
mind
that
it
was
best
to
have
the
family
budget
in
the
hands
of
the
mother
in
the
sordid
surroundings
of
the
mean
streets
of
great
cities
there
is
developing
in
women
practical
wisdom
and
a
fine
sense
of
individual
responsibility
perhaps
of
greater
significance
than
just
how
separation
allowances
are
being
spent
is
the
fact
that
women
have
discovered
that
their
work
as
housewives
and
mothers
has
a
value
recognized
by
governments
in
hard
cash
it
makes
one
speculate
as
to
whether
wives
in
the
warring
nations
will
step
back
without
a
murmur
into
the
dependence
on
one
man
or
whether
these
simple
women
may
contribute
valuable
ideas
towards
the
working
out
of
sound
schemes
of
motherhood
pensions
the
women
of
great
britain
are
experiencing
economic
independence
they
are
living
in
an
atmosphere
of
recognition
of
the
value
of
their
work
as
housewives
and
mothers
women
leaders
in
all
classes
give
no
indication
of
regarding
pensions
or
remuneration
in
gainful
pursuits
as
other
than
permanent
factors
in
social
development
and
much
of
the
best
thought
of
men
as
well
as
women
is
centered
on
group
experiments
in
domestic
coöperation
in
factory
canteens
in
municipal
kitchens
which
are
a
natural
concomitant
to
the
wider
functioning
of
women
great
britain
is
not
talking
about
feminism
it
is
living
it
perhaps
nothing
better
illustrates
the
national
acceptance
of
the
fact
than
the
widespread
amusement
touched
with
derision
caused
by
the
story
of
the
choleric
gentlemen
who
on
being
asked
at
the
time
of
one
of
the
government
registrations
whether
his
wife
was
dependent
upon
him
or
not
roared
in
rage
well
if
my
wife
is
dependent
on
me
i
like
to
know
what
man
she
is
dependent
on
only
second
to
britain
lesson
for
us
in
the
of
its
women
and
the
thorough
mobilization
of
their
and
executive
ability
is
its
lesson
in
protection
for
all
industrial
workers
it
stands
as
one
people
against
the
present
enemy
and
in
its
effort
does
not
fail
to
give
thought
to
race
conservation

at

the

by

in

iv
mobilizing
women
in
france
compared
with
the
friction
in
the
mobilization
of
in
great
britain
the
readjustment
in
the
lives
of
women
in
france
was
like
the
opening
out
of
some
harmonious
pageant
in
full
accord
with
popular
sympathy
but
who
has
not
said
france
is
different
it
is
different
and
in
nothing
more
so
than
in
its
attitude
toward
its
women
without
discussion
with
organizations
of
men
without
hindrance
from
the
government
women
filled
the
gaps
in
the
industrial
army
it
was
obvious
that
the
new
workers
being
unskilled
would
need
training
the
government
threw
open
the
technical
schools
to
them
a
spirit
of
hospitality
of
helpfulness
of
common
sense
reigned
illustration
the
french
poilu
on
furlough
is
put
to
work
harrowing
and
it
was
not
only
in
industry
that
france
showed
herself
wise
i
found
that
the
government
had
coöperated
unreservedly
with
all
the
philanthropic
work
of
women
and
had
given
them
a
wide
sphere
in
which
they
could
rise
above
amateurish
effort
and
carry
out
plans
calling
for
administrative
ability
when
the
conseil
national
des
femmes
françaises
inaugurated
its
work
to
bring
together
the
scattered
families
of
belgium
and
northern
france
and
when
the
association
pour
fraternelle
aux
évacués
began
its
work
for
the
dispersed
peoples
of
the
provinces
an
order
was
issued
by
the
government
to
every
prefect
to
furnish
lists
of
all
refugees
in
his
district
to
the
headquarters
of
the
women
societies
in
paris
it
was
through
this
good
will
on
the
part
of
the
central
government
that
these
societies
were
able
to
bring
together
forty
thousand
belgian
families
and
to
clothe
and
place
in
school
or
at
work
the
entire
dispersed
population
of
the
reconquered
districts
of
nor
did
these
societies
cease
work
with
the
completion
of
their
initial
effort
they
turned
themselves
into
employment
bureaus
and
with
the
aid
and
sanction
of
the
government
found
work
for
the
thousands
of
women
who
were
thrown
out
of
employment
they
had
the
machinery
to
accomplish
their
object
the
council
being
an
old
established
society
organized
throughout
the
country
and
the
association
to
aid
the
refugees
from
a
nonpartisan
name
adopted
by
the
way
at
the
request
of
the
minister
of
the
interior
to
cover
for
the
moment
the
patriotic
work
of
the
leading
suffrage
society
had
active
units
in
every
prefecture
one
of
the
admirable
private
philanthropies
was
the
canteen
at
the
lazarre
station
in
paris
i
am
tempted
to
single
it
out
because
its
organizer
countess
de
berkaim
told
me
that
in
all
the
months
she
had
been
running
it
and
it
was
open
hours
of
the
day
not
a
single
volunteer
had
been
five
minutes
late
the
canteen
was
opened
in
february
with
a
reading
and
rest
room
six
hundred
soldiers
a
day
have
been
fed
the
two
big
rooms
donated
by
the
railway
for
the
work
were
charming
with
their
blue
and
white
checked
curtains
dividing
kitchen
from
restaurant
and
rest
room
from
reading
room
the
work
is
no
small
monument
to
the
reliability
and
organizing
faculty
of
french
women
it
was
in
france
too
that
i
found
the
group
of
women
who
realized
that
the
permanent
change
which
the
war
was
making
in
the
relation
of
women
to
society
needed
fundamental
handling
mlle
valentine
thomson
founder
of
la
vie
féminine
held
that
not
only
was
the
war
an
economic
struggle
and
not
only
must
the
financial
power
of
the
combatants
rest
on
the
labor
of
women
but
the
future
of
the
nations
will
largely
depend
upon
the
attitude
which
women
take
toward
their
new
obligations
realizing
that
business
education
would
be
a
determining
factor
in
that
attitude
mlle
thomson
persuaded
her
father
who
was
then
minister
of
commerce
to
send
out
an
official
recommendation
to
the
chambers
of
commerce
to
open
the
commercial
schools
to
girls
the
advice
was
very
generally
followed
but
as
paris
refused
a
group
of
women
backed
by
the
ministry
founded
a
school
in
which
were
given
courses
of
instruction
in
the
usual
business
subjects
and
lectures
on
finance
commercial
law
and
international
trade
mlle
thomson
herself
turned
her
business
gifts
to
good
use
in
a
successful
effort
to
build
up
for
the
immediate
benefit
of
artists
and
workers
the
doll
trade
of
which
france
was
once
supreme
mistress
exhibitions
of
the
art
old
and
new
were
held
in
many
cities
in
the
united
states
in
south
america
and
in
england
the
dolls
went
to
the
hearts
of
lovers
of
beauty
and
what
promised
surer
financial
return
to
the
hearts
of
the
children
to
do
something
for
france
that
stood
first
in
the
minds
of
the
initiators
of
this
commercial
project
they
knew
her
people
must
be
employed
and
next
the
desire
to
bring
back
charm
to
an
old
art
prompted
their
effort
mlle
thomson
fully
realizes
just
what
made
in
germany
signifies
the
peoples
of
the
world
have
had
their
taste
corrupted
by
floods
of
the
cheap
and
tawdry
germany
has
been
steadily
educating
us
to
demand
quantity
quantity
mountains
high
there
is
promise
that
the
doll
at
least
will
be
rescued
by
france
and
made
worth
the
child
devotion
in
industry
as
well
as
in
all
else
one
feels
that
in
france
there
has
not
been
so
much
a
revolution
as
an
orderly
development
women
were
in
munition
factories
even
before
the
war
the
number
has
merely
swelled
the
women
of
the
upper
and
lower
bourgeois
class
always
knew
their
husband
business
the
one
could
manage
the
shop
the
other
could
bargain
with
the
best
of
them
as
to
contracts
and
output
women
were
trained
as
bookkeepers
and
clerks
under
napoleon
i
he
wanted
men
as
soldiers
and
so
decreed
women
should
go
into
business
and
the
woman
of
the
aristocratic
class
has
merely
slipped
out
of
her
seclusion
as
if
putting
aside
an
garment
and
now
carries
on
her
philanthropies
in
more
serious
and
coördinated
manner
we
know
the
practical
business
experience
possessed
by
french
women
and
so
are
prepared
to
learn
that
many
a
big
commercial
enterprise
the
owner
having
gone
to
the
front
is
now
directed
by
his
capable
wife
that
is
but
a
development
too
is
it
not
for
we
had
all
heard
long
ago
of
mme
duval
even
if
we
had
not
eaten
at
her
restaurants
and
though
we
had
never
bought
a
ribbon
or
a
carpet
at
the
bon
marché
we
had
heard
of
the
woman
who
helped
break
through
old
merchant
habits
and
gave
the
world
the
department
store
but
nothing
has
been
more
significant
in
its
growth
during
the
war
than
the
small
enterprises
in
which
the
husband
and
wife
in
the
domestic
munition
shop
laboring
side
by
side
with
a
little
group
of
assistants
have
been
turning
out
marvels
of
skill
the
man
is
now
in
the
trenches
fighting
for
france
and
the
woman
takes
command
and
leads
the
industrial
battalion
to
victory
she
knows
she
fights
for
france
a
word
more
about
her
business
for
she
is
playing
an
economic
part
that
brings
us
up
at
attention
she
may
be
solving
the
problem
of
adjustment
of
home
and
work
so
puzzling
to
women
there
are
just
such
domestic
shops
dotted
all
over
the
map
of
france
in
the
paris
district
alone
there
are
over
eighteen
hundred
of
them
the
conditions
are
so
excellent
and
the
ruling
wages
so
high
that
the
minimum
wage
law
passed
in
applied
only
to
the
sweated
home
workers
in
the
clothing
trade
and
not
to
the
domestic
munition
shops
a
commission
which
included
in
its
membership
a
trade
unionist
sent
by
the
british
government
in
the
darkest
days
to
find
why
it
was
that
france
could
produce
so
much
more
ammunition
than
england
found
these
tiny
workshops
with
their
primitive
equipment
performing
miracles
the
output
was
huge
and
of
the
best
the
woman
when
at
the
head
seemed
to
turn
out
more
than
the
man
she
worked
with
such
undying
energy
the
commission
said
it
was
the
spirit
of
france
that
drove
the
workers
forward
and
renewed
the
flagging
energies
but
even
the
trade
unionist
referred
to
the
absence
of
all
opposition
to
women
on
the
part
of
organizations
of
men
perhaps
the
spirit
of
france
is
undying
because
in
it
is
a
spirit
of
unity
and
harmony
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
one
very
practical
explanation
of
the
unmistakable
energy
of
the
french
worker
both
man
and
woman
the
whole
nation
has
the
wise
custom
of
taking
meal
time
with
due
seriousness
the
break
at
noon
in
the
great
manufactories
as
well
as
in
the
family
workshop
is
long
averaging
one
hour
and
a
half
and
reaching
often
to
two
hours
the
french
never
gobble
because
food
is
necessary
to
animal
life
they
do
not
on
that
account
take
a
puritanical
view
of
it
they
dare
enjoy
it
in
spite
of
its
physiological
bearing
they
sit
down
to
it
dwell
upon
it
get
its
flavor
and
after
the
meal
they
sit
still
and
as
a
nation
permit
themselves
unabashed
to
enjoy
the
sensation
of
hunger
appeased
that
the
common
sense
spirit
of
france
of
course
the
worker
is
renewed
hurls
herself
on
the
work
again
with
ardor
and
losing
no
time
through
fatigue
throws
off
an
enormous
output
wages
perform
their
material
share
in
spurring
the
worker
louis
barthou
says
that
the
woman
average
is
eight
francs
a
day
long
ago
it
seems
long
ago
she
could
earn
at
best
five
francs
in
the
paris
district
she
works
on
piece
work
now
getting
the
same
rate
as
men
and
think
of
it
this
must
indeed
be
because
of
the
spirit
of
france
this
woman
does
better
than
men
on
the
light
munition
work
and
equals
yes
equals
her
menfolk

the
heavy
shells

do
not

garnered

piled
up

progress

ventured
on
a

wholesome
guidance
and
so
many

have
followed
suit
that

may
be
regarded
as
making
a
great

in

is

fifteen

and
one
gets
a
soup
meat
and
a
vegetable
and
fruit
the
world
seems
to
be
counselling
us
that
if
we
wish
to
be
well
and
cheaply
fed
we
must
go
where
there
are
experts
to
cook
where
buying
is
done
in
quantity
and
where
the
manager
knows
about
nutritive
values
if
a
word
of
praise
is
extended
to
the
maire
of
the
xiv
arrondissement
for
his
very
splendid
work
an
example
to
all
france
he
quickly
urges
ah
but
mme
brunot
and
so
it
is
always
if
you
exclaim
oh
the
spirit
of
the
men
of
france
and
a
frenchman
ears
catch
your
words
he
will
correct
ah
but
the
women
and
the
women
do
stand
above
all
other
women
they
have
had
such
opportunity
for
heroism
whose
heart
does
not
beat
the
faster
when
the
names
soisson
and
mme
macherez
are
spoken
the
mayor
and
the
council
gone
she
assumes
the
office
and
keeps
order
while
german
shells
fall
thick
on
the
town
and
then
the
enemy
enters
and
asks
for
the
mayor
and
she
replies
le
maire
moi
and
then
do
we
women
not
like
to
think
of
mlle
deletete
staying
at
her
post
in
the
telegraph
office
in
houplines
in
spite
of
german
bombardments
and
calmly
facing
tormentors
when
they
smashed
her
instruments
and
threatened
her
with
death
of
france
in
the
enemy
hands
and
in
each
village
and
town
some
woman
staying
behind
to
nurse
the
sick
and
wounded
to
calm
the
population
when
panic
threatens
to
stand
invincible
between
the
people
and
their
conquerors
it
is
very
splendid
the
french
man
holding
steady
at
the
front
the
french
woman
an
unyielding
second
line
of
defense
but
what
of
france
words
of
praise
must
not
swallow
our
sense
of
obligation
let
us
with
our
hundred
millions
of
people
face
the
figures
the
death
rate
in
france
not
counting
the
military
loss
is
twenty
per
thousand
with
a
birth
rate
of
eight
per
thousand
in
paris
for
the
year
ending
august
there
were
thousand
nine
hundred
and
seventeen
births
in
the
year
ending
in
the
same
month
the
births
dropped
to
thousand
one
hundred
and
the
total
deaths
for
that
year
in
all
france
were
one
million
one
hundred
thousand
and
the
births
three
hundred
and
twelve
thousand
france
is
profoundly
infinitely
sad
she
has
cause
i
shall
never
forget
looking
into
the
very
depths
of
her
sorrow
when
i
was
at
creil
a
great
drive
was
in
progress
the
wounded
were
being
brought
down
from
the
front
troops
hurried
forward
four
different
regiments
passed
as
i
sat
at
déjeuner
the
restaurant
full
of
its
noonday
patrons
was
a
typical
french
café
giving
on
the
street
we
could
have
reached
out
and
touched
the
soldiers
they
marched
without
music
without
song
or
word
marched
in
silence
some
of
the
men
were
from
this
very
town
their
little
sons
with
set
faces
too
walked
beside
them
and
had
brought
them
bunches
of
flowers
the
people
in
the
restaurant
never
spoke
above
a
whisper
and
when
the
troops
passed
were
as
silent
as
death
there
was
no
cheer
but
just
a
long
wistful
gaze
the
soldiers
looking
into
their
eyes
they
into
the
soldiers
but
france
can
bear
her
burden
can
solve
her
problem
if
we
lift
our
full
share
from
her
bent
shoulders
her
women
can
save
the
children
if
the
older
men
relieved
by
our
young
soldiers
come
back
from
the
trenches
setting
women
free
for
the
work
of
child
saving
france
can
rebuild
her
villages
if
her
supreme
architects
her
skilled
workers
are
replaced
in
the
trenches
by
our
armies
france
can
renew
her
spirit
and
save
her
body
if
her
experts
in
science
if
her
poets
and
artists
are
sent
back
to
her
and
our
less
great
bare
their
breasts
to
the
huns
v
mobilizing
women
in
germany
the
military
mobilization
of
germany
was
no
more
immediate
and
effective
than
the
call
to
arms
for
women
on
august
the
summons
went
out
and
german
women
were
at
once
part
of
the
smooth
running
machine
of
efficiency
the
world
says
the
kaiser
has
been
preparing
for
war
for
forty
years
the
world
means
that
he
has
been
preparing
the
fighting
force
the
sword
and
guns
were
to
be
ready
but
the
military
arm
of
the
nation
the
german
government
believes
is
but
the
first
line
of
attack
the
people
are
the
second
line
and
so
they
too
in
all
their
life
activities
were
not
forgotten
the
military
aristocracy
has
never
neglected
the
function
of
women
in
the
state
the
definition
of
their
function
may
differ
from
ours
but
that
there
is
a
function
is
recognized
and
it
is
related
to
the
other
vital
social
organs
slowly
through
the
last
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
there
had
grown
up
clubs
among
german
women
focusing
on
a
definite
bit
of
work
or
crystallizing
about
an
idea
germany
even
had
suffrage
societies
politics
however
were
forbidden
by
the
government
women
were
not
allowed
to
hang
on
the
fringe
of
a
meeting
held
to
discuss
politics
but
the
women
of
the
fatherland
were
free
to
pool
their
ideas
in
philanthropic
and
hygienic
corners
and
venture
out
at
times
on
educational
highways
the
froebel
societies
had
many
a
contest
with
the
government
for
to
the
military
mind
the
gentle
pedagogue
theories
seemed
subversive
of
discipline
as
enforced
by
spurs
and
bayonets
these
clubs
covering
every
trade
and
profession
every
duty
and
every
aspiration
of
women
were
dotted
over
the
german
empire
at
last
they
drew
together
in
a
federation
the
government
looked
on
it
saw
a
machine
created
and
believing
in
thorough
organization
no
doubt
gave
thought
to
the
possibilities
of
the
bund
deutscher
frauenvereine
at
the
outbreak
of
war
gertrud
baumer
was
president
of
the
bund
she
was
a
leader
of
great
ability
marshalling
half
a
million
of
women
no
other
organization
was
so
widespread
and
except
perhaps
der
vaterlandische
frauenverein
with
its
two
thousand
one
hundred
and
fifty
branches
it
was
evangelical
and
military
the
empress
was
its
patron
its
popular
name
is
the
armée
der
kaiserin
there
the
two
great
national
societies
stood
one
aristocratic
the
other
democratic
one
appealing
to
the
ruling
class
the
other
holding
in
bonds
of
fellowship
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
urban
and
the
rural
the
professional
and
the
industrial
woman
every
belligerent
president
or
premier
has
faced
exactly
the
same
perplexity
what
woman
what
society
is
to
be
recognized
as
leader
the
question
has
brought
beads
of
perspiration
to
the
foreheads
of
statesmen
france
solved
the
difficulty
urbanely
it
said
yes
to
each
and
all
it
promised
coöperation
and
kept
the
promise
by
affably
always
affably
and
hospitably
accepting
this
service
from
one
society
and
suggesting
another
pressing
need
to
its
competitor
it
sorted
out
capabilities
and
warded
off
duplication
perhaps
this
did
not
bring
the
fullest
efficiency
but
the
loss
was
more
than
made
up
no
doubt
by
a
free
field
for
initiative
britain
ignored
all
existing
organizations
of
women
and
after
a
year
and
a
half
of
puzzlement
created
a
separate
government
department
for
their
mobilization
america
struck
out
still
another
course
it
took
the
heads
of
several
national
societies
bound
them
in
one
committee
to
which
it
gave
perhaps
with
the
idea
of
avoiding
any
danger
of
friction
neither
power
nor
funds
germany
faced
the
same
critical
moment
for
decision
the
government
wanted
efficient
use
of
on
the
land
in
the
factory
in
the
home
and
that
quickly
it
made
use
of
the
best
existing
machinery
gertrud
baumer
visited
the
ministerium
des
innern
and
on
august
she
issued
a
call
for
the
mobilization
of
women
for
service
to
the
fatherland
in
the
nationale
frauendienst
under
the
aegis
of
the
government
with
the
national
treasury
behind
her
baumer
summoned
the
women
of
the
empire
by
order
every
woman
and
every
organization
of
women
was
to
fall
in
line
under
the
frauendienst
in
each
village
and
city
for
the
duration
of
the
war
in
each
army
district
the
government
appointed
a
woman
as
directress
and
by
order
to
town
and
provincial
authorities
made
the
frauendienst
part
of
local
executive
affairs
among
the
immediate
duties
laid
upon
the
frauendienst
by
the
authorities
was
the
task
of
registering
all
needy
persons
of
providing
cheap
eating
places
opening
workrooms
and
setting
up
nurseries
for
children
especially
for
those
who
were
motherless
and
those
whose
fathers
had
fallen
at
the
front
and
whose
mothers
were
in
some
gainful
pursuit
with
these
duties
went
the
administrative
service
of
coöperating
with
the
government
in
keeping
up
an
even
supply
of
foodstuffs
and
controlling
the
buying
and
selling
of
food
germany
anticipated
as
did
no
other
belligerent
the
unemployment
which
would
follow
a
declaration
of
war
and
prepared
to
meet
the
condition
a
great
deal
of
army
work
such
as
tent
sewing
belts
for
cartridges
bread
sacks
and
sheets
for
hospitals
was
made
immediately
available
for
the
women
thrown
out
of
luxury
trades
in
the
first
month
of
the
war
the
frauendienst
opened
in
all
great
centers
machinery
was
installed
by
magic
and
through
the
six
in
berlin
alone
thousand
women
were
given
paid
employment
in
one
week
such
efforts
could
not
of
course
absorb
the
surplus
labor
for
unemployment
was
very
great
eighty
percent
of
the
women
and
milliners
were
out
of
work
percent
of
the
workers
in
glass
and
percent
in
china
the
frauendienst
investigated
two
hundred
and
thousand
needy
cases
and
in
berlin
alone
found
sixty
thousand
women
who
had
lost
their
employment
charity
had
to
render
help
here
again
it
is
an
example
of
the
alertness
of
the
organization
and
its
close
connection
with
the
government
that
the
berlin
magistracy
deputed
to
hilfscommissionen
from
the
frauendienst
the
work
of
giving
advice
and
charity
relief
to
the
unemployed
knitting
rooms
were
opened
clothing
depots
mending
rooms
where
donated
clothing
was
repaired
and
in
one
month
thousand
orders
for
milk
five
hundred
thousand
for
bread
and
three
hundred
thousand
for
meals
were
distributed
for
the
city
authorities
the
adjustment
to
war
requirements
went
on
more
quickly
in
germany
than
in
any
other
country
before
a
year
had
passed
the
surplus
hands
had
been
absorbed
and
a
shortage
of
labor
power
was
beginning
to
be
felt
and
now
opens
the
war
drama
set
with
the
same
scene
everywhere
women
hurry
forward
to
take
up
the
burden
laid
down
by
men
and
to
assume
the
new
occupations
made
necessary
by
the
organization
of
the
world
for
military
conflict
to
tell
of
germany
is
merely
to
speak
in
bigger
numbers
women
in
munitions
of
course
well
over
the
million
mark
trolley
conductors
of
course
six
hundred
in
berlin
alone
before
the
first
christmas
women
are
making
the
fuses
fashioning
the
big
shells
and
at
the
same
heavy
machines
used
by
the
men
that
speaks
volumes
the
same
heavy
machines
great
britain
and
france
have
in
every
case
introduced
lighter
machinery
for
their
women
but
whatever
the
conditions
in
germany
the
women
are
handling
high
explosives
sewing
heavy
saddlery
operating
the
heaviest
drill
machines
women
have
been
put
on
the
hardest
jobs
hitherto
filled
by
men
in
the
mining
and
furnace
company
at
differdingen
they
are
found
doing
work
at
the
slag
and
blast
furnaces
which
had
always
required
men
of
great
endurance
they
work
on
the
same
shifts
as
the
men
receive
the
same
pay
but
are
not
worked
overtime
because
they
must
go
home
and
perform
their
domestic
duties
one
feels
the
weight
of
the
german
system
patient
women
shoulder
double
burdens
they
always
did
in
the
post
and
telegraph
department
there
is
an
army
of
fifty
thousand
women
the
telephone
service
is
entirely
in
their
hands
and
running
more
smoothly
than
formerly
käthe
schirmacher
declares
comfortingly
in
the
that
one
must
not
forget
that
these
women
know
many
important
bits
of
information
and
keep
silent
women
have
learned
to
keep
a
secret
one
hundred
and
eighty
nurses
experts
with
the
were
in
the
front
line
dressing
stations
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
and
before
a
week
of
conflict
had
passed
women
were
in
the
field
post
and
frau
reimer
organizer
of
official
chauffeurs
was
on
the
western
line
of
attack
agriculture
claims
more
women
than
any
occupation
in
germany
they
were
always
on
the
farm
perhaps
they
are
happier
there
now
since
they
themselves
are
in
command
it
is
said
that
the
peasants
work
in
the
boots
and
trousers
of
their
husbands
and
ride
in
the
saddle
war
has
liberated
german
women
from
the
collar
and
put
them
on
horseback
but
strangest
and
most
unexpected
of
all
is
the
professional
and
administrative
use
of
women
the
government
has
sent
women
architects
and
interior
decorators
to
east
prussia
to
plan
and
carry
through
reconstruction
work
over
a
hundred
to
be
exact
one
hundred
and
sixteen
at
last
accounts
have
taken
the
places
of
men
in
administrative
departments
connected
with
the
railways
many
widows
who
have
shown
capacity
have
been
put
in
government
positions
of
importance
formerly
held
by
their
husbands
women
have
become
farm
managers
superintendents
of
dairy
industries
and
representatives
of
landed
proprietors
the
disseminating
of
all
instruction
and
information
for
women
on
war
economies
was
delegated
to
the
league
of
women
domestic
science
clubs
the
berlin
course
was
held
in
no
less
a
place
than
the
abgeordnetenhaus
and
the
herrenhaus
opened
its
doors
wide
on
rural
women
day
when
agricultural
week
was
held
at
the
capital
when
the
full
history
of
the
war
comes
to
be
written
no
doubt
one
reason
for
germany
marvelous
power
to
stand
so
long
against
the
world
will
be
found
in
her
use
of
every
brain
and
muscle
of
the
nation
this
has
been
for
her
no
exclusive
war
her
entire
people
to
their
last
ounce
of
energy
have
been
engaged
and
this
supreme
service
on
the
part
of
german
women
seeks
democratic
expression
from
them
comes
the
clearest
bravest
word
that
has
reached
us
across
the
border
the
most
hopeful
sign
is
this
manifesto
from
the
suffrage
organizations
to
the
government
up
to
the
present
germany
has
stood
in
the
lowest
rank
of
nations
as
regards
women
rights
in
most
civilized
lands
women
already
have
been
given
a
large
share
in
public
affairs
german
women
have
been
granted
nothing
except
within
the
most
insignificant
limits
in
new
zealand
australia
and
most
american
states
and
even
before
the
war
in
finland
and
norway
they
had
been
given
political
rights
sweden
russia
and
many
other
countries
give
them
a
full
or
limited
franchise
the
war
has
brought
a
full
victory
to
the
women
of
england
canada
russia
and
denmark
and
large
concessions
are
within
sight
in
france
holland
and
hungary
among
us
germans
not
only
the
national
but
even
the
commercial
franchise
is
denied
and
even
a
share
in
the
industrial
and
commercial
courts
in
the
demand
for
the
democratization
of
german
public
life
our
legislators
do
not
seem
even
to
admit
the
existence
of
women
but
during
the
war
the
cooperation
of
women
in
public
life
has
unostentatiously
grown
from
year
to
year
until
the
number
of
women
engaged
in
various

women
over
the
top
in
america
american
women
have
begun
to
go
over
the
top
they
are
going
up
the
and
out
into
all
man
land
perhaps
love
of
adventure
tempts
them
perhaps
love
of
money
or
a
fine
spirit
of
service
but
whatever
the
propelling
motive
we
are
seeing
them
make
the
venture
there
is
nothing
new
in
our
day
in
a
woman
being
paid
for
her
work
some
of
it
but
she
has
never
before
been
seen
in
america
employed
for
instance
as
a
section
hand
on
a
railway
the
gangs
are
few
and
small
as
yet
but
there
the
women
are
big
and
strong
specimens
of
foreign
birth
they
trim
the
ballast
and
wield
the
heavy
tamping
tool
with
zest
they
certainly
have
muscles
and
are
tempted
to
use
them
vigorously
at
three
dollars
a
day
in
the
machine
shops
where
more
skill
than
strength
is
called
for
the
american
element
with
its
quick
wits
and
deft
fingers
predominates
young
women
are
working
at
the
lathe
with
so
much
precision
and
accuracy
that
solicitude
as
to
what
would
become
of
the
world
if
all
its
men
marched
off
to
war
is
in
a
measure
assuaged
in
the
push
and
drive
of
the
industrial
world
women
are
handling
dangerous
chemicals
in
making
flash
lights
and
for
high
explosive
shells
the
american
college
girl
is
not
as
yet
transmuting
her
prowess
of
the
athletic
field
into
work
on
the
anvil
as
is
the
university
woman
in
england
but
she
has
demonstrated
her
manual
strength
and
skill
on
the
farm
with
plough
and
harrow
women
and
girls
answer
our
call
for
messenger
service
and
their
intelligence
and
courtesy
are
an
improvement
upon
the
manners
of
the
young
barbarians
of
the
race
women
operate
elevators
lifting
us
with
safety
to
the
seventh
heaven
or
plunging
us
with
precision
to
the
depths
there
were
those
at
first
who
refused
to
entrust
their
lives
to
such
frail
hands
and
there
are
still
some
who
look
concerned
when
they
see
a
woman
at
the
lever
but
on
the
whole
the
elevator
girl
has
gained
the
confidence
of
her
public
and
has
gained
it
by
skill
not
by
feminine
wiles
for
even
men
wo
shoot
into
space
with
a
woman
at
the
helm
whose
sole
equipment
is
charm
with
need
of
less
skill
than
the
elevator
operator
but
more
patience
and
tact
in
managing
human
nature
the
woman
conductor
is
getting
her
patrons
into
line
we
are
still
a
little
embarrassed
in
her
presence
we
try
not
to
stare
at
the
woman
in
her
sensible
uniform
while
she
on
her
part
tries
to
look
unconscious
and
with
much
dignity
accomplishes
the
common
aim
much
more
successfully
than
do
we
she
is
so
attentive
to
her
duties
so
courteous
and
withal
so
calm
and
serious
that
i
hope
she
will
abide
with
us
longer
than
the
duration
of
the
war
in
short
america
is
witnessing
the
beginning
of
a
great
industrial
and
social
change
and
even
those
who
regard
the
situation
as
temporary
can
not
doubt
that
the
experience
will
have
important
reactions
the
development
is
more
advanced
than
it
was
in
great
britain
at
a
corresponding
time
for
even
before
the
united
states
entered
the
conflict
women
were
being
recruited
in
war
industries
they
have
opened
up
every
line
of
service
there
is
not
an
occupation
in
which
a
woman
is
not
found
when
men
go
women
go
to
work
a
distinguished
general
at
the
end
of
the
cuban
war
enlarging
upon
the
poet
idea
of
woman
weeping
rôle
in
wartime
said
in
a
public
speech
when
the
country
called
women
put
guns
in
the
hands
of
their
soldier
boys
and
bravely
sent
them
away
after
the
were
said
there
was
nothing
for
these
women
to
do
but
to
go
back
and
wait
wait
wait
the
excitement
of
battle
was
not
for
them
it
was
simply
a
season
of
anxiety
and
heartrending
inactivity
now
the
fact
is
when
a
great
call
to
arms
is
sounded
for
the
men
of
a
nation
women
enlist
in
the
industrial
army
if
women
did
indeed
sit
at
home
and
weep
the
enemy
would
soon
conquer
the
dull
census
tells
the
thrilling
story
before
our
civil
war
women
were
found
in
less
than
a
hundred
trades
at
its
close
in
over
four
hundred
the
census
of
gives
two
hundred
and
thousand
women
in
gainful
pursuits
that
of
one
million
eight
hundred
and
thousand
of
the
transvaal
at
war
this
story
was
told
to
me
by
an
english
officer
he
led
a
small
band
of
soldiers
down
into
the
boer
country
on
the
north
from
rhodesia
as
far
as
he
dared
he
did
not
see
a
man
even
boys
as
young
as
fifteen
had
joined
the
army
but
at
the
post
of
economic
duty
stood
the
boer
woman
she
was
tending
the
herds
and
carrying
on
all
the
work
of
the
farm
she
was
the
base
of
supplies
that
was
why
the
british
finally
put
her
in
a
concentration
camp
her
man
could
not
be
beaten
with
her
at
his
back
war
compels
women
to
work
that
is
one
of
its
merits
women
are
forced
to
use
body
and
mind
they
are
not
can
not
be
idlers
perhaps
that
is
the
reason
military
nations
hold
sway
so
long
their
reign
continues
not
because
they
draw
strength
from
the
conquered
nation
but
because
their
women
are
roused
to
exertion
active
mothers
ensure
a
virile
race
the
peaceful
nation
if
its
women
fall
victims
to
the
luxury
which
rapidly
increasing
wealth
brings
will
decay
if
there
come
no
spiritual
awakening
no
sense
of
responsibility
of
service
then
perhaps
war
alone
can
save
it
the
routing
of
idleness
and
ease
by
compulsory
labor
is
the
good
counterbalancing
some
of
the
evil
the
rapidly
increasing
employment
of
women
then
is
the
usual
and
happy
accompaniment
of
war
but
the
development
has
its
opponents
and
that
is
nothing
new
either
let
us
look
them
over
one
by
one
the
most
mischievous
objector
is
the
person
oftenest
a
woman
who
says
the
war
will
be
short
and
fundamental
changes
therefore
should
not
be
made
this
agreeable
prophecy
does
not
spring
from
a
heartening
belief
in
victory
but
only
from
the
procrastinating
attitude
why
get
ready
to
prepare
for
anything
less
certain
than
death
seems
folly
to
many
of
the
sex
in
patient
waiting
then
there
is
the
official
who
constantly
sees
the
seamy
side
of
industrial
life
and
who
concludes
we
can
scarcely
blame
him
that
it
would
be
well
if
women
were
excluded
entirely
from
factory
life
the
bad
condition
of
industrial
surroundings
bulks
large
in
his
mind
and
the
value
of
organized
work
to
us
mortals
bulks
small
we
are
all
too
inclined
to
forget
that
the
need
for
work
can
not
be
eliminated
but
the
unhealthy
process
in
a
dangerous
trade
can
clean
up
the
factory
rather
than
clean
out
the
women
is
a
sound
slogan
and
then
comes
the
objector
who
is
exercised
as
to
the
effect
of
paid
work
upon
woman
charm
solicitude
on
this
score
is
often
buried
in
a
woman
heart
it
was
a
woman
the
owner
of
a
large
estate
who
when
proposing
to
employ
women
asked
how
many
men
she
would
have
to
hire
in
addition
to
dig
plough
and
do
all
the
hard
work
on
learning
that
the
college
units
do
everything
on
a
farm
she
queried
anxiously
but
how
about
their
corsets
to
the
explanation
they
do
wear
any
came
the
regret
what
a
pity
to
make
themselves
so
unattractive
i
have
heard
fear
expressed
too
lest
sex
attraction
be
lost
through
work
on
army
hats
the
machinery
being
noisy
and
the
operative
if
she
talk
running
the
danger
of
acquiring
a
sharp
high
voice
one
could
but
wonder
if
most
american
women
work
on
army
hats
among
the
women
actually
employed
i
have
found
without
exception
a
fine
spirit
of
service
so
many
of
them
have
a
friend
or
brother
over
there
that
backing
up
the
boys
makes
a
strong
personal
appeal
but
some
of
the
women
who
have
left
factory
life
behind
are
adopting
an
attitude
towards
the
present
industrial
situation
as
lacking
in
vision
as
in
patriotism
throughout
a
long
discussion
in
which
some
of
these
women
participated
i
was
able
to
follow
and
get
their
point
of
view
to
them
a
woman
acting
as
a
messenger
an
elevator
operator
or
a
trolley
conductor
was
anathema
and
the
tempting
of
women
into
these
employments
seemed
but
the
latest
vicious
trick
of
the
capitalist
the
conductor
in
her
becoming
uniform
was
most
reprehensible
and
her
evident
satisfaction
in
her
job
suggested
to
her
critics
that
she
merely
was
trying
to
play
a
melodramatic
part
as
a
war
hero
in
any
case
the
conductor
occupation
was
one
no
woman
should
be
in
crowded
and
pushed
about
as
she
is
it
was
puzzling
to
know
why
it
was
regarded
as
right
for
a
woman
to
pay
five
cents
and
be
pushed
and
unbecoming
for
another
woman
to
be
paid
eighteen
dollars
and
ninety
cents
a
week
and
run
the
risk
of
a
jolt
when
stepping
outside
her
barrier
but
the
ideals
of
yesterday
fail
to
make
their
appeal
it
is
not
the
psychological
moment
to
urge
on
the
ground
of
comfort
the
right
to
protection
the
contrast
between
the
trenches
and
the
street
car
or
factory
is
too
striking
but
it
is
however
the
exact
moment
to
plead
for
better
care
of
workers
both
women
and
men
because
their
health
and
skill
are
as
necessary
in
attaining
the
national
aim
as
the
soldiers
prowess
and
it
is
the
time
to
advocate
the
protection
of
the
worker
from
long
hours
because
the
experience
of
europe
has
proved
that
a
greater
and
better
output
is
achieved
when
a
short
day
is
strictly
adhered
to
when
the
weekly
is
enjoyed
and
sunday
rest
respected
the
united
states
is
behind
other
great
industrial
countries
in
legal
protection
for
the
workers
war
requirements
may
force
us
to
see
in
the
health
of
the
worker
the
greatest
of
national
assets
meantime
whether
approved
or
not
the
american
woman
is
going
over
the
top
four
hundred
and
more
are
busy
on
aeroplanes
at
the
curtiss
works
the
manager
of
a
munition
shop
where
but
fifty
women
are
employed
is
putting
up
a
dormitory
to
accommodate
five
hundred
an
index
of
expectation
five
thousand
are
employed
by
the
remington
arms
company
at
bridgeport
at
the
international
arms
and
fuse
company
at
bloomfield
new
jersey
two
thousand
eight
hundred
are
employed
the
day
i
visited
the
place
in
one
of
the
largest
shops
women
had
only
just
been
put
on
the
work
but
it
was
expected
that
in
less
than
a
month
they
would
be
found
handling
all
of
the
twelve
hundred
machines
under
that
one
roof
alone
the
skill
of
the
women
staggers
one
after
a
week
or
two
they
master
the
operations
on
the
turret
gauging
and
routing
machines
the
best
worker
on
the
facing
machine
is
a
woman
she
is
a
piece
worker
as
many
of
the
women
are
and
is
paid
at
the
same
rate
as
men
this
woman
earned
the
day
i
saw
her
five
dollars
and
forty
cents
she
tossed
about
the
fuse
parts
and
played
with
that
machine
as
i
would
with
a
baby
perhaps
it
was
in
somewhat
the
same
spirit
she
seemed
to
love
her
toy
most
of
the
testers
and
inspectors
are
women
they
measure
the
parts
step
by
step
and
weigh
the
completed
fuse
carrying
off
the
palm
for
reliability
the
manager
put
it
for
inspection
the
women
are
more
conscientious
than
men
they
do
measure
or
weigh
just
one
piece
shoving
along
a
untouched
and
let
it
go
at
that
they
test
each
that
did
not
surprise
me
but
i
was
not
prepared
to
hear
that
the
women
do
not
have
so
many
accidents
as
men
or
break
the
machines
so
often
in
explanation
the
manager
threw
over
an
imaginary
lever
with
vigor
sufficient
to
shake
the
factory
men
put
their
whole
strength
on
women
are
more
gentle
and
patient
nor
are
the
railways
neglecting
to
fill
up
gaps
in
their
working
force
with
women
the
pennsylvania
road
it
is
said
has
recruited
some
seven
hundred
of
them
in
the
erie
railroad
women
are
not
only
engaged
as
work
classifiers
in
the
locomotive
clerical
department
but
hardy
polish
women
are
employed
in
the
car
repair
shops
they
move
great
wheels
as
if
possessed
of
the
strength
of
hercules
and
in
the
locomotive
shops
i
found
women
working
on
machines
with
ease
and
skill
just
as
i
came
up
to
one
operator
she
lifted
an
engine
to
the
table
and
started
drilling
out
the
studs
she
had
been
at
the
work
only
a
month
and
explained
her
skill
by
the
information
that
she
was
swedish
and
had
always
worked
with
her
husband
in
their
shop
all
the
other
hands
and
the
shapers
too
were
americans
whose
husbands
old
employees
were
now
over
there
not
one
seemed
to
have
any
sense
of
the
unusual
even
the
little
blond
seated
in
her
booth
at
the
gates
of
the
works
with
her
brass
discs
about
her
had
in
a
few
months
time
changed
a
revolution
into
an
established
custom
she
and
the
discs
seemed
old
friends
women
are
adaptable
illustration
by
underwood
and
the
daily
round
in
the
erie
railroad
workshops
but
everywhere
i
gathered
the
impression
that
the
men
are
a
bit
uneasy
a
foreman
in
one
factory
pointed
out
a
man
who
would
not
have
voted
for
suffrage
had
he
guessed
that
women
were
to
rush
in
and
gobble
everything
up
i
tried
to
make
him
see
that
it
was
the
vote
that
gave
the
voracious
appetite
but
necessity
or
desire
to
serve
and
in
any
case
women
do
not
push
men
out
they
push
them
up
in
not
a
single
instance
did
i
hear
of
a
man
being
turned
off
to
make
a
place
for
a
woman
he
had
left
his
job
to
go
into
the
army
or
was
advanced
to
heavier
or
more
skilled
work
as
to
how
many
women
have
supplanted
men
or
poured
into
the
new
war
industries
no
figures
are
available
one
guess
has
put
it
at
a
million
but
that
is
merely
a
guess
i
have
seen
them
by
the
tens
the
hundreds
the
thousands
the
number
is
large
and
rapidly
increasing
we
may
know
that
something
important
is
happening
when
even
the
government
takes
note
the
united
states
labor
department
has
recognized
the
by
establishing
a
division
of
women
work
with
branches
in
every
state
it
looks
as
if
these
bureaus
of
employment
would
not
be
idle
with
a
showing
of
one
thousand
five
hundred
applicants
the
first
week
the
new
york
office
was
opened
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
government
effort
will
save
the
round
pegs
from
getting
into
the
square
holes
but
even
the
round
peg
in
the
round
hole
brings
difficulties
when
adam
smith
asserted
that
of
all
sorts
of
luggage
man
was
the
most
difficult
to
move
he
forgot
woman
the
instant
women
are
carried
into
a
new
industry
they
bring
with

puzzling
problems
where
shall
we
put
their
coats
and
picture
hats
how
shall
we
cover
up
their
hair
what
shall
we
feed
them
with
they
must
have
lockers
and
rest
rooms
caps
and
overalls
and
above
all
canteens
the
munition
workers
the
conductors
in
fact
all
women
in
active
work
get
prodigiously
hungry
they
have
made
a
regiment
of
dietitians
think
about
calories
here
is
what
one
of
the
street
railways
in
new
york
city
offered
them
on
a
given
day
tomato
soup
or
with
an
order
roast

of
veal
beef
lamb
fricassee
ham

sirloin

small

ham
omelet

coffee

banana
or

the
canteen
is
open
every
hour
of
the
and
the
women
conductors
at
the
end
of
each
run
usually
take
a
bite
and
then
have
a
substantial
meal
during
the
long
break
of
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
middle
of
the
day
another
problem
brought
to
us
by
women
in
industry
is
how
can
we
house
them
the
war
industries
have
drawn
large
numbers
to
new
centers
the
haphazard
accommodation
which
men
win
put
up
with
wo
satisfy
women
they
demand
more
and
get
more
to
attract
the
best
type
of
women
the
munition
plants
are
putting
up
dormitories
to
accommodate
hundreds
of
workers
and
are
making
their
plants
more
attractive
with
rest
rooms
and
hospital
accommodation
take
for
instance
the
briggs
and
stratton
company
which
in
order
to
draw
high
grade
workers
built
its
new
factory
in
one
of
the
best
sections
of
milwaukee
the
workrooms
are
as
clean
as
the
proverbial
dutch
woman
doorstep
from
the
top
of
the
benches
to
the
ceiling
the
walls
are
glass
to
ensure
daylight
in
every
corner
and
by
night
the
system
of
indirect
lighting
gives
such
perfectly
diffused
light
that
not
a
heavy
shadow
falls
anywhere
and
the
hospital
room
and
nurse
well
one
would
rejoice
to
have
an
accident
daily
the
factory
may
become
the
exemplar
for
the
home
the
professional
woman
is
going
over
the
top
and
with
a
good
opinion
of
herself
i
can
do
this
work
better
than
any
man
was
the
announcement
made
by
a
young
woman
from
the
pacific
coast
as
she
descended
upon
the
city
hall
in
an
eastern
town
credentials
in
her
hand
and
asked
for
the
position
of
city
chemist
there
was
not
a
microbe
she
did
not
know
to
its
undoing
or
a
deadly
poison
she
could
not
bring
from
its
hiding
place
the
town
had
suffered
from
graft
and
the
mayor
thinking
a
woman
might
scare
the
thieves
as
well
as
the
bacteria
appointed
the
chemist
who
believed
in
herself
and
she
is
just
one
of
many
who
have
been
taking
up
such
work
formerly
of
the
positions
filled
by
the
new
york
intercollegiate
bureau
of
occupations
were
secretarial
or
teaching
positions
now
of
its
applicants
have
been
placed
as
physicists
chemists
office
managers
sanitary
experts
exhibit
secretaries
and
the
like
the
temporary
positions
used
to
outnumber
the
permanent
placements
at
present
the
reverse
is
true
of
the
women
placed
four
times
as
many
as
formerly
get
salaries
ranging
above
eighteen
hundred
dollars
a
year
the
story
told
at
the
employment
bureaus
in
connection
with
professional
societies
and
clubs
such
as
the
chemists
club
is
the
same
women
are
being
placed
not
merely
as
teachers
of
chemistry
or
as
routine
laboratory
workers
in
hospitals
but
also
as
experimental
and
control
chemists
in
industrial
plants
in
the
great
rolling
mills
they
are
testing
steel
at
the
copper
smelters
they
are
found
in
the
laboratories
the
government
has
thrown
doors
wide
open
to
women
they
are
physicists
and
chemists
in
the
united
states
bureaus
of
standards
mines
and
soils
sanitary
experts
in
military
camps
research
chemists
in
animal
nutrition
and
fertilizers
at
state
experiment
stations
but
the
industrial
barrier
is
the
one
most
recently
scaled
women
are
now
found
as
analytical
research
or
control
chemists
in
the
canneries
in
dye
and
electrical
works
in
flour
and
paper
mills
in
insecticide
companies
and
cement
works
they
test
the
steel
that
will
carry
us
safely
on
our
journeys
they
pass
upon
the
chemical
composition
of
the
flavor
in
our
cake
as
heads
of
departments
in
metal
refining
companies
they
determine
the
kind
of
copper
battery
we
shall
use
and
they
have
a
finger
in
our
liquid
glues
household
oils
and
polishes
and
the
awakened
spirit
of
social
responsibility
has
opened
new
callings
the
college
woman
not
only
is
beginning
to
fill
welfare
positions
inside
the
factory
but
is
acting
as
protective
officer
in
towns
near
military
camps
perhaps
one
of
the
newest
and
most
interesting
positions
is
that
of
employment
secretary
the
losing
of
employees
has
become
so
serious
and
general
that
big
industries
have
engaged
women
who
devote
their
time
to
looking
up
absentees
and
finding
out
why
each
worker
left
and
so
we
see
on
all
hands
women
breaking
through
the
old
accustomed
bounds
not
only
as
workers
but
as
voters
the
war
has
called
women
over
the
top
since
that
fateful
august
four
provinces
of
canada
and
the
dominion
itself
have
raised
the
banner
of
votes
for
women
nevada
and
montana
declared
for
suffrage
before
the
war
was
four
months
old
and
denmark
enfranchised
its
women
before
the
year
was
out
and
when
america
went
forth
to
fight
for
democracy
abroad
arkansas
michigan
vermont
nebraska
north
dakota
rhode
island
began
to
lay
the
foundations
of
freedom
at
home
and
new
york
in
no
faltering
voice
proclaimed
full
liberty
for
all
its
people
lastly
great
britain
has
enfranchised
its
women
and
surely
the
congress
of
the
united
states
will
not
lag
behind
the
mother
of
parliaments
the
world
is
facing
changes
as
great
as
the
breaking
up
of
the
feudal
system
causes
as
fundamental
more
and
more
cataclysmic
are
at
work
than
at
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
among
the
changes
none
is
more
marked
than
the
intensified
development
in
what
one
may
call
for
lack
of
a
better
term
the
woman
movement
the
advance
in
political
freedom
has
moved
steadily
forward
during
the
past
quarter
of
a
century
but
in
the
last
three
years
progress
has
been
intense
and
striking
the
peculiarity
in
attainment
of
political
democracy
for
women
has
lain
in
the
fact
that
while
for
men
economic
freedom
invariably
preceded
political
enfranchisement
in
the
case
of
women
the
conferring
of
the
vote
in
no
single
case
was
related
to
the
stage
which
the
enfranchised
group
had
attained
in
the
matter
of
economic
independence
nowhere
were
even
those
women
who
were
entirely
lacking
in
economic
freedom
excluded
on
that
account
from
any
extension
of
suffrage
even
in
discussions
of
the
right
of
suffrage
no
reference
has
ever
been
made
in
dealing
with
women
claim
to
the
relation
universally
recognized
in
the
case
of
men
of
political
enfranchisement
to
economic
status
serfdom
gave
way
to
the
wage
system
before
democracy
developed
for
men
and
the
colored
man
was
emancipated
before
he
was
enfranchised
for
this
reason
the
coming
of
women
as
paid
workers
over
the
top
may
be
regarded
as
in
any
case
is
certainly
a
strong
element
in
attaining
any
real
political
freedom
complete
service
to
their
country
in
this
crisis
may
lead
women
to
that
economic
freedom
which
will
change
a
political
possession
into
a
political
power
but
the
requirement
is
readiness
to
do
and
to
do
well
the
task
which
offers
must
give
itself
unreservedly
at
the
front
women
must
show
not
only
eagerness
but
fitness
to
substitute
for
it
will
hearten
the
nation
help
to
make
the
path
clear
if
individual
women
declare
that
though
the
call
to
them
has
not
yet
come
for
a
definite
service
the
time
of
waiting
will
not
be
spent
in
complaint
nor
yet
in
foolish
but
in
careful
and
conscientious
training
for
useful
work
each
woman
must
prepare
so
that
when
the
nation
need
arises
she
can
stand
at
salute
and
say
here
is
your
servant
trained
and
ready
women
are
not
driven
over
the
top
through
they
go
over
it
of
their
own
accord
vii
eve
pay
envelope
no
woman
is
a
cross
between
an
angel
and
a
goose
she
is
a
very
human
creature
she
has
many
of
man
sins
and
some
virtues
of
her
own
moving
up
from
slavery
through
all
the
various
forms
of
serfdom
attachment
to
the
soil
confinement
to
a
given
trade
exclusion
from
citizenship
payment
in
kind
on
to
full
economic
freedom
men
have
shown
definite
reactions
at
each
step
women
respond
to
the
same
stimuli
the
free
man
is
a
better
worker
than
slave
or
serf
so
is
the
free
woman
all
the
old
gibes
at
her
ineptitudes
have
broken
their
points
against
the
actualities
of
her
ability
as
a
wage
worker
the
free
man
is
more
alert
to
obligation
more
conscientious
in
performance
than
the
bond
servant
so
is
the
free
woman
with
pay
envelope
or
pension
eve
is
a
better
helpmate
and
mother
than
ever
before
the
free
man
carries
a
lighter
heart
than
the
villain
so
does
the
free
woman
men
have
always
borne
personal
grief
more
easily
than
women
observers
remarked
the
fact
the
reason
is
the
same
an
absorbing
occupation
ordered
and
regarded
as
important
which
brings
a
return
allowing
the
recipient
to
patronize
what
he
or
she
thinks
wise
that
brings
happiness
not
boisterous
but
dignified
it
may
be
a
holocaust
through
which
eve
gains
that
pay
envelope
but
the
material
possession
brings
gratification
nevertheless
it
is
a
tiny
straw
showing
the
set
of
the
wind
that
leisure
class
british
women
however
large
their
unearned
bank
account
show
no
reluctance
to
accept
pay
for
their
work
and
full
responsibility
in
their
new
position
of
employee
women
are
supposed
to
have
liked
to
serve
for
mere
love
of
service
for
love
of
child
love
of
husband
there
is
of
course
many
a
subtle
relation
which
ca
be
weighed
and
paid
for
but
toil
even
for
very
own
hearthstone
can
be
valued
in
hard
cash
the
daughters
of
eve
no
less
than
the
sons
of
adam
react
happily
to
a
recognition
that
expresses
itself
in
a
fair
wage
the
verdict
comes
from
all
sides
that
women
were
never
more
content
of
course
they
are
content
the
weight
of
suppression
is
being
lifted
for
many
their
drudgery
is
for
the
first
time
paid
for
is
not
that
invigorating
the
pay
envelope
is
equal
to
that
of
men
is
not
that
a
new
experience
giving
eve
often
finds
her
pay
envelope
heavier
than
that
of
the
man
working
at
her
side
right
there
in
her
hand
then
she
holds
proof
that
the
old
prejudice
against
her
as
an
inferior
worker
is

are
finding
themselves
even

that

is
under
no

in
the
twentieth
century
with
eighteen

ringing
up

summon
her

her
for

reflect

denials
rather
than

down

with
a
thought
to
possible
competitors
have
favored
protecting
them
from

work
has
eve
been
a
bit
spoiled
has
she
let
herself
too
easily
be
classed
with
children
and
allowed
a
line
to
be
drawn
between
men
and
women
in
industry
is
it
a
bit
of
woman
proverbial
logic
to
demand
special
protection
and
at
the
same
time
insist
upon
equal
pay
for
equal
work
the
hopelessness
of
attaining
the
promise
of
the
slogan
is
well
illustrated
in
the
case
of
a
gray
haired
woman
i
once
met
in
a
london
printing
shop
in
her
early
days
she
had
been
one
of
the
women
taken
on
by
the
famous
printing
firm
of
mccorquodale
that
was
before
protective
legislation
applied
to
women
she
became
a
highly
skilled
printer
earning
more
than
any
man
in
the
shop
when
there
was
pressure
of
work
she
was
always
one
of
the
group
of
experts
chosen
to
carry
through
the
rush
order
that
meant
on
occasion
overtime
or
night
work
then
she
went
on
to
tell
me
how
her
skill
was
checked
in
her
very
prime
regulations
as
to
women
labor
were
gradually
fixed
in
the
law
all
the
printers
in
the
shop
she
said
favored
the
laws
limiting
her
freedom
but
not
theirs
soon
her
wages
reflected
the
contrast
her
employer
called
her
to
his
office
one
day
and
explained
i
can
not
afford
to
pay
you
as
much
as
the
men
any
longer
you
are
not
worth
as
much
to
me
not
being
able
to
work
saturday
afternoon
at
night
or
overtime
she
was
put
on
lower
grade
work
and
her
pay
envelope
grew
slight
this
woman
was
not
discussing
the
value
of
shorter
working
hours
she
was
pointing
out
that
equal
pay
can
not
rule
for
an
entire
group
of
workers
when
restrictions
apply
to
part
of
the
group
and
not
to
the
whole
body
we
meet
here
not
a
theory
but
an
incontrovertible
fact
pay
is
not
equal
and
can
not
be
where
conditions
are
wholly
unequal
protection
for
the
woman
worker
means
exactly
what
it
would
mean
for
the
alien
man
if
by
law
he
were
forbidden
to
work
saturday
afternoon
overtime
or
at
night
while
the
citizen
worker
was
without
restriction
the
alien
would
be
cut
off
from
advancement
in
every
trade
in
which
he
did
not
by
overwhelming
numbers
dominate
the
situation
he
would
be
kept
to
lower
grade
processes
he
would
receive
much
lower
pay
than
the
unprotected
worker
what
common
sense
would
lead
us
to
expect
in
the
hypothetical
case
of
an
alien
man
has
happened
for
the
woman
worker
oddly
enough
she
has
not
herself
asked
for
this
protection
but
it
has
been
urged
very
largely
by
women
not
of
the
industrial
class
women
teachers
doctors
lawyers
women
of
leisure
are
the
advocates
of
special
legislation
for
industrial
women
and
yet
in
their
own
case
they
are
entirely
reasonable
and
ask
no
favors
the
woman
teacher
and
quite
truly
insists
that
she
works
as
hard
and
as
long
hours
as
the
man
in
her
grade
of
service
and
on
that
sound
foundation
she
builds
her
just
demand
for
equal
pay
women
doctors
and
lawyers
have
never
asked
for
other
than
a
square
deal
in
their
professions
it
would
be
well
perhaps
if
industrial
women
were
permitted
to
guide
their
own
ship
they
have
knowledge
enough
to
reach
a
safe
harbor
there
was
a
hint
that
they
were
about
to
assume
the
helm
when
the
rank
and
file
of
union
workers
voted
down
at
the
conference
of
the
women
trade
union
league
the
resolution
proposing
a
law
to
forbid
women
acting
as
conductors
it
was
also
suggestive
when
a
woman
rose
and
asked
of
the
speaker
on
dangerous
trades
whether
men
did
not
suffer
from
exposure
to
fumes
acids
and
dust
women
have
so
long
been
urging
that
they
are
people
that
they
have
forgotten
perchance
that
men
are
people
also
men
respond
to
rest
and
recreation
as
do
human
beings
of
the
opposite
sex
all
workers
need
and
both
sexes
should
have
protection
but
if
only
one
sex
in
industrial
life
can
have
bulwarks
thrown
up
about
it
men
should
be
the
favored
ones
just
now
they
are
few
they
are
precious
they
should
be
wrapped
in
cotton
wool
the
industrial
woman
should
stand
unqualifiedly
for
the
exclusion
of
children
from
gainful
pursuits
many
years
ago
the
british
government
had
miss
collett
one
of
the
labor
correspondents
of
the
board
of
trade
make
a
special
study
of
the
influence
of
the
employment
of
married
women
on
infant
mortality
the
object
was
to
prove
that
there
was
direct
cause
and
effect
the
investigator
after
an
exhaustive
study
covering
many
industrial
centers
brought
back
the
report
not
proven
but
the
statistics
showed
one
most
interesting
relation
in
districts
where
the
prevailing
custom
permitted
the
employment
of
children
as
early
as
the
law
allowed
infant
mortality
was
high
and
in
districts
where
few
children
were
employed
infant
mortality
was
low
no
explanation
of
this
striking
revelation
was
made
in
the
report
but
many
who
commented
on
the
tables
pointed
out
that
the
employment
of
the
population
in
its
early
years
sapped
the
vitality
of
the
community
to
such
an
extent
that
its
offspring
were
weakened
in
other
words
the
employment
of
the
immature
child
more
than
the
employment
of
that
child
when
grown
and
married
works
harm
to
the
race
the
woman
with
a
pay
envelope
must
not
then
be
willing
to
swell
the
family
budget
by
turning
her
children
into
the
wage
market
for
if
she
does
she
creates
a
dangerous
competitor
for
herself
and
puts
in
certain
jeopardy
the
virility
of
her
nation
but
in
this
war
time
women
have
secured
more
than
new
and
larger
pay
envelopes
for
each
belligerent
has
reckoned
up
the
woman
worth
as
mother
in
coin
of
the
realm
it
is
enough
to
turn
eve
head
pay
and
pensions
accorded
her
all
at
once
allowances
to
dependents
are
more
however
than
financial
expedients
they
are
part
of
the
psychological
of
the
great
war
the
fighting
man
must
be
more
than
more
than
assured
of
care
if
ill
or
wounded
he
must
have
his
mind
undisturbed
by
conditions
at
home
governments
now
know
that
there
must
be
no
just
cause
for
complaint
in
the
family
at
the
rear
if
the
man
at
the
front
is
to
be
fully
effective
in
the
interest
of
the
fighting
line
governments
dare
not
leave
the
home
to
the
haphazard
care
of
charity
and
so
the
great
belligerents
have
adopted
systems
for
an
uninterrupted
flow
of
money
aid
to
the
hearthstone
the
wife
feels
dependence
on
the
nation
for
which
she
and
her
man
are
making
sacrifices
the
soldier
has
a
sense
of
closer
relationship
with
the
country
cause
for
which
he
fights
content
at
home
and
sense
of
gratitude
in
the
trenches
build
up
loyalty
everywhere
the
state
allowance
answers
an
economic
want
and
a
psychological
necessity
it
is
part
of
our
national
lack
of
technique
that
we
were
slow
to
make
provision
for
the
dependents
of
enlisted
men
and
even
then
were
not
whole
hearted
it
may
have
been
our
inherited
distrust
of
the
conscript
that
led
us
to
feel
that
only
by
his
volunteering
something
will
a
precious
antidote
be
administered
to
the
spirit
of
the
drafted
man
to
protect
his
individualism
from
taint
the
united
states
soldier
must
bear
part
of
the
financial
burden
europe
on
the
other
hand
is
working
on
a
basis
of
reciprocity
the
nation
exacts
service
from
the
man
and
gives
complete
service
to
his
dependents
in
america
the
man
is
bound
to
serve
the
community
but
the
community
is
not
bound
to
serve
him
and
yet
in
our
case
there
is
peculiar
need
of
this
even
exchange
of
obligations
the
care
of
parents
in
the
united
states
falls
directly
upon
their
children
while
some
of
our
allies
had
even
before
the
war
carefully
devised
laws
regulating
pensions
to
the
aged
but
first
let
us
get
the
simple
skeleton
of
the
various
allowance
laws
in
mind
the
scale
of
the
allowance
in
different
countries
adapts
itself
to
national
standards
and
varying
cost
of
living
the
canadian
allowance
seems
the
most
generous
at
least
of
the
soldier
pay
is
given
directly
to
his
dependents
the
government
gives
an
additional
twenty
dollars
and
the
donations
of
the
patriotic
fund
bring
up
the
monthly
allowance
of
a
wife
with
three
children
to
sixty
dollars
the
allowance
as
might
be
expected
is
low
in
italy
the
soldier
wife
gets
of
a
lira
a
day
each
child
lira
and
either
a
father
or
mother
alone
lira
or
if
both
are
living
one
and
lire
together
the
british
allowance
is
much
higher
the
wife
getting
twelve
shillings
and
sixpence
a
week
if
she
has
one
child
the
weekly
allowance
rises
to
nineteen
and
sixpence
if
two
children
to
and
sixpence
if
three
to
shillings
and
if
there
are
four
or
more
children
the
mother
receives
three
shillings
a
week
for
each
extra
child
between
the
extremes
of
italy
and
england
stands
france
the
wife
receiving
one
franc
centimes
a
day
each
child
under
sixteen
years
of
age
centimes
and
a
dependent
parent
centimes
japan
grants
no
government
allowance
a
japanese
official
in
response
to
my
inquiry
wrote
relations
the
first
and
friends
the
next
try
to
help
the
dependents
as
far
as
possible
but
if
they
have
neither
relatives
nor
friends
who
have
sufficient
means
to
help
them
then
the
association
consisting
of
ladies
or
the
municipal
officials
afford
subvention
to
them
under
the
law
passed
by
congress
in
october
an
american
private
receiving
dollars
a
month
when
on
service
abroad
must
allot
fifteen
dollars
a
month
to
his
wife
and
the
government
adds
to
this
dollars
and
if
there
is
one
child
an
additional
ten
dollars
with
five
dollars
for
each
additional
child
a
man
can
secure
an
allowance
from
the
government
of
ten
dollars
a
month
to
a
dependent
parent
if
he
allots
five
dollars
a
month
such
are
the
bare
bones
of
the
allowance
schemes
of
the
allies
on
the
western
front
in
the
united
states
the
general
policy
of
exemption
boards
as
suggested
by
the
central
authorities
is
most
disciplinary
as
regards
women
their
capacity
for
is
rigidly
inquired
into
our
men
are
definitely
urging
women
to
a
position
of
economic
independence
the
aim
is
while
securing
soldiers
for
the
army
to
relieve
the
government
of
the
expense
of
dependency
on
the
part
of
women
there
is
no
doubt
that
our
men
at
least
are
faced
toward
the
future
no
less
indicative
is
it
of
a
new
world
that
the
allowance
laws
of
all
the
western
belligerents
recognize
marriages
in
our
own
law
marriage
is
presumed
if
the
man
and
woman
have
lived
together
in
the
openly
acknowledged
relation
of
husband
and
wife
during
two
years
immediately
preceding
the
date
of
the
declaration
of
war
and
the
illegitimate
child
stands
equal
with
the
legitimate
provided
the
father
acknowledges
the
child
or
has
been
judicially
ordered
or
decreed
to
contribute
to
the
child
support
men
are
feminists
their
hearts
have
softened
even
towards
the
relatives
for
the
word
parent
is
not
only
broad
enough
to
cover
the
father
mother
grandparents
or
stepfather
and
mother
of
the
man
but
of
the
spouse
also
thus
passeth
the
curse
of
the
one
need
not
be
endowed
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
to
foretell
that
allowances
in
war
time
will
broaden
out
into
motherhood
pensions
in
peace
times
it
would
be
an
ordinary
human
reaction
should
the
woman
enjoying
a
pension
refuse
to
give
up
on
the
day
peace
is
declared
her
quickly
acquired
habit
of
holding
the
purse
strings
that
would
be
accepting
international
calm
at
the
expense
of
domestic
differences
the
social
value
of
encouraging
the
mother
natural
feeling
of
responsibility
toward
her
child
by
putting
into
her
hands
a
state
pension
is
being
let
us
note
widely
tested
and
may
demonstrate
the
wisdom
and
economy
of
devoting
public
funds
to
mothers
rather
than
to
crêches
and
juvenile
asylums
the
allowance
laws
may
prove
the
charter
of
woman
liberties
her
pay
envelope
may
become
her
contract
securing
the
right
of
viii
pooling
brains
employ
them
this
was
the
advice
given
to
a
large
conference
of
women
met
to
discuss
business
opportunities
for
their
sex
the
advice
was
vouchsafed
by
a
young
lawyer
after
the
problem
of
opening
wider
fields
to
women
in
the
legal
profession
had
been
looked
at
from
every
angle
only
to
end
in
the
question
what
can
we
do
to
increase
their
practice
she
spoke
with
animation
as
if
she
had
found
the
key
to
the
situation
employ
them
perhaps
more
than
determination
to
mend
their
ways
was
roused
by
the
short
and
pointed
remark
the
advice
has
wider
application
taking
thirty
names
of
women
at
random
i
learned
in
response
to
an
inquiry
that
only
four
had
women
physicians
two
had
women
lawyers
and
only
one
a
woman
dentist
women
of
large
real
estate
holdings
had
never
even
for
the
most
unimportant
work
secured
the
services
of
an
architect
of
their
own
sex
further
inquiry
brought
out
the
fact
that
of
a
long
list
of
women
clubs
and
associations
which
have
built
or
altered
property
for
their
purposes
only
one
had
engaged
a
woman
architect
perhaps
it
is
indicative
of
a
lack
of
nothing
more
serious
than
a
sense
of
humor
that
we
women
unite
and
apparently
without
embarrassment
demand
that
masculine
presidents
governors
mayors
and
legislatures
shall
appoint
women
to
office
this
unabashed
faith
in
the
good
will
of
men
seems
not
misplaced
for
not
only
do
public
men
show
some
confidence
in
the
official
capacity
of
women
but
to
my
inquiry
as
to
whom
was
due
their
opportunities
to
get
on
business
women
invariably
replied
to
men
however
the
loyalty
of
women
to
women
is
increasing
and
their
solidarity
on
sound
lines
of
service
is
a
thing
of
steady
growth
thoughtful
women
for
instance
do
not
wish
a
woman
put
in
a
position
of
responsibility
simply
because
she
is
a
woman
but
they
are
even
more
opposed
to
having
a
candidate
of
peculiar
fitness
overlooked
merely
because
she
is
not
a
man
while
the
conscientious
and
poised
women
are
not
willing
to
urge
any
and
every
woman
for
a
given
office
they
do
tenaciously
hold
that
there
are
positions
which
cry
aloud
for
women
and
for
which
the
right
women
should
he
found
in
conquering
a
fair
field
women
will
have
to
pool
their
brains
even
more
effectively
than
they
have
in
the
past
our
efforts
at
combination
are
a
mere
mushroom
growth
compared
with
the
generations
of
training
our
big
brothers
have
had
in
pooling
brains
war
and
the
chase
gave
them
their
first
lessons
in
cooperation
nor
has
war
been
a
bad
teacher
for
women
just
as
the
crimean
war
and
our
civil
war
put
florence
nightingale
and
clara
barton
and
the
trained
nurse
on
the
map
this
war
is
bringing
the
medical
woman
to
the
fore
women
surgeons
and
doctors
unlike
many
other
groups
offer
themselves
fully
trained
for
service
they
know
they
have
something
to
give
and
they
know
the
soldiers
need
according
to
an
official
statement
the
emergency
call
of
the
army
for
men
physicians
and
surgeons
fell
two
thousand
short
of
being
answered
the
necessity
of
the
soldier
and
the
skill
of
the
women
will
no
doubt
in
the
end
be
brought
effectively
together
for
although
the
government
of
the
united
states
like
great
britain
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
has
left
to
ever
farseeing
france
the
honor
of
extending
hospitality
to
american
women
doctors
their
strong
national
organization
with
a
membership
of
four
thousand
will
in
time
no
doubt
persuade
uncle
sam
to
take
his
plucky
women
doctors
over
the
top
under
the
stars
and
stripes
organization
crystallized
about
an
unselfish
desire
and
skilled
ability
to
serve
is
irresistible
the
pooling
of
the
brains
of
women
that
has
been
going
on
on
a
scale
for
more
than
a
bears
analyzing
these
associations
have
almost
invariably
centered
about
a
service
to
be
rendered
even
the
first
petition
for
political
enfranchisement
urged
it
as
the
duty
of
the
women
of
this
country
to
secure
to
themselves
the
elective
franchise
unselfishness
draws
numbers
as
a
magnet
draws
steel
filings
the
spirit
of
service
lying
at
the
heart
of
the
great
national
organizations
made
possible
quick
response
to
new
duties
immediately
upon
our
entrance
into
the
war
the
suffragists
said
we
wish
to
serve
and
we
are
ready
for
service
the
government
used
their
net
of
local
centers
for
purposes
of
registrations
and
war
appeals
naturally
there
were
many
efforts
more
foolish
than
effective
in
the
universal
rush
to
help
america
was
not
peculiar
in
this
nor
for
the
matter
of
that
were
women
war
it
does
make
the
blood
course
through
the
veins
every
generous
citizen
cries
aloud
what
can
i
do
perhaps
men
are
a
little
more
voluble
than
women
their
emotions
not
finding
such
immediate
and
approved
vent
along
clicking
needles
and
tangled
skeins
of
wool
on
the
whole
the
initiative
and
organizing
ability
of
women
has
stood
out
supremely
of
the
two
departments
of
the
red
cross
which
are
still
left
in
the
command
of
women
the
bureau
of
nursing
with
miss
delano
at
its
head
mobilized
immediately
three
thousand
of
the
fourteen
thousand
nurses
enrolled
the
first
red
cross
medical
unit
with
its
full
quota
of
nurses
completely
equipped
stood
on
european
soil
before
an
american
soldier
was
there
of
the
units
ready
for
service
twelve
with
from
to
one
hundred
nurses
each
are
now
in
france
two
of
the
five
units
organized
for
the
navy
each
with
its
forty
active
nurses
and
twenty
reserves
are
established
abroad
and
two
hundred
and
thirty
nurses
are
already
in
active
naval
service
here
miss
delano
holds
constantly
in
reserve
fifteen
hundred
nurses
as
emergency
detachments
a
reservoir
from
which
some
eight
hundred
have
been
drawn
for
cantonment
hospitals
an
inflow
of
nearly
one
thousand
nurses
each
month
keeps
the
reservoir
ready
to
meet
the
drain
the
chapter
sprang
up
at
a
call
in
the
night
no
one
can
help
admiring
their
functioning
there
may
be
criticism
grumbling
but
the
is
moving
irresistibly
like
a
machine
and
women
are
the
motive
power
from
start
to
finish
the
chapters
with
their
five
million
members
joined
in
three
thousand
units
over
the
united
states
are
so
many
monuments
to
the
ability
of
women
for
detail
once
mobilized
the
women
have
thus
far
been
able
to
serve
two
thousand
war
hospitals
with
surgical
dressings
and
to
send
abroad
thirteen
million
separate
articles
packed
carefully
boxed
labelled
and
accounted
for
on
their
books
not
only
does
this
directing
of
manual
work
stand
to
the
credit
of
the
chapters
but
they
have
given
courses
of
lectures
in
home
nursing
and
dietetics
to
thousand
women
and
in
first
aid
ten
thousand
classes
have
been
held
and
thousand
certificates
issued
to
the
proficient
certainly
one
object
of
the
red
cross
to
stimulate
the
volunteer
work
of
women
has
been
accomplished
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
with
such
examples
of
efficiency
before
it
the
red
cross
founded
by
clara
barton
places
merely
two
bureaus
in
the
hands
of
a
woman
has
chosen
no
woman
as
an
officer
has
put
but
one
woman
on
its
central
and
executive
committee
and
not
a
single
woman
on
its
present
controlling
body
the
war
council
it
may
be
that
the
protest
against
the
centralization
of
all
volunteer
effort
in
the
red
cross
in
spite
of
president
wilson
appeal
was
due
to
the
fact
that
women
feared
that
their
energies
running
to
other
lines
than
nursing
and
surgical
dressings
would
be
entirely
sidetracked
the
honor
of
the
splendid
war
work
of
the
young
women
christian
association
belongs
to
women
the
war
work
council
of
the
national
board
of
young
women
christian
associations
shows
an
example
of
how
immediately
efficient
an
established
organization
can
be
in
an
emergency
as
one
sees
its
great
war
fund
roll
up
one
exclaims
what
money
raisers
women
are
the
immediate
demands
upon
the
fund
are
for
hostess
houses
at
cantonments
where
soldiers
can
meet
their
women
visitors
dormitories
providing
emergency
housing
for
women
employees
at
certain
army
centers
the
strengthening
of
club
work
among
the
younger
girls
of
the
nation
profoundly
affected
by
war
conditions
and
the
sending
of
experienced
organizers
to
coöperate
with
the
women
leaders
of
france
and
russia
and
to
install
nurses
huts
at
the
base
hospitals
of
france
it
makes
one
heart
beat
high
to
think
of
women
spending
millions
splendidly
they
who
have
always
been
told
to
save
pennies
frugally
well
those
hard
days
were
times
of
training
women
learned
not
to
waste
a
very
worthy
pooling
of
brains
because
springing
up
with
no
tradition
behind
it
was
the
national
league
for
woman
service
in
six
months
it
drew
to
itself
two
hundred
thousand
members
and
built
organizations
in
states
established
classes
to
train
women
for
the
new
work
opening
to
them
opened
recreation
centers
and
canteens
at
which
were
entertained
on
a
single
sunday
at
one
center
eighteen
hundred
soldiers
and
sailors
so
excellent
was
its
bureau
of
registration
and
information
for
women
workers
that
the
united
states
department
of
labor
took
over
not
only
the
files
and
methods
of
the
woman
league
for
service
but
the
entire
staff
with
miss
obenauer
at
its
head
if
imitation
is
the
sincerest
flattery
what
shall
we
say
of
complete
adoption
of
work
and
workers
with
an
honorable
by
your
leave
and
outspoken
praise
and
nothing
could
show
a
finer
spirit
of
service
than
this
yielding
up
of
work
initiated
by
a
civil
society
and
the
willing
passing
of
it
into
government
hands
not
only
the
labor
department
has
established
a
special
women
division
with
a
woman
at
its
head
but
the
ordnance
office
of
the
war
department
has
opened
in
its
industrial
service
section
a
woman
division
putting
miss
mary
van
kleeck
in
charge
but
still
our
government
lags
behind
our
allies
in
mobilizing
power
of
initiative
and
her
organizing
faculty
the
woman
committee
of
the
council
of
national
defense
appointed
soon
after
the
outbreak
of
war
still
has
no
administrative
power
as
one
member
of
the
committee
says
we
are
not
allowed
to
do
anything
without
the
consent
of
the
council
of
national
defense
there
is
no
appropriation
for
the
committee
we
are
furnished
with
headquarters
stationery
some
printing
and
two
stenographers
but
nothing
more
it
is
essential
that
we
raise
money
to
carry
on
the
other
expenses
the
great
trouble
is
that
now
as
always
men
want
women
to
do
the
work
while
they
do
the
overseeing
illustration
the
women
of
the
motor
corps
of
the
national
league
for
woman
service
refuting
the
traditions
that
women
have
neither
strength
nor
endurance
perhaps
holding
the
helm
has
become
second
nature
to
men
simply
because
they
have
held
the
helm
so
long
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
they
have
a
very
definite
desire
to
have
women
help
steer
the
ship
surely
the
readiness
with
which
they
are
sharing
their
political
power
with
women
would
seem
to
indicate
their
wish
for
cooperation
on
a
plan
of
perfect
equality
in
any
case
it
is
not
necessary
to
hang
on
the
skirts
of
government
america
has
always
shown
evidence
of
greater
gift
in
private
enterprise
than
state
action
perhaps
women
will
demonstrate
the
national
characteristic
it
was
farsightedness
and
enterprise
that
led
the
intercollegiate
bureaus
of
occupations
societies
run
for
women
by
women
to
strike
out
in
this
crisis
and
open
up
new
callings
for
their
clients
and
still
better
to
persuade
colleges
and
schools
to
modify
curricula
to
meet
the
changed
demands
women
are
often
passed
over
because
they
are
not
prepared
the
bureaus
have
found
the
demand
for
women
in
industrial
chemistry
and
physics
for
instance
to
be
greater
than
the
supply
because
the
graduates
of
women
colleges
have
not
been
carried
far
enough
in
mathematics
and
in
chemistry
have
been
kept
too
much
to
theoretical
work
for
example
the
head
of
a
certain
industry
was
willing
to
give
the
position
of
chemist
at
his
works
to
a
woman
he
needed
some
one
to
suggest
changes
in
process
from
time
to
time
and
to
watch
waste
he
set
down
eight
simple
problems
such
as
might
arise
any
day
in
his
factory
for
the
candidates
to
answer
some
of
the
women
all
college
graduates
who
had
specialized
in
chemistry
could
not
answer
a
single
problem
and
none
showed
that
grip
of
the
science
which
would
enable
them
to
give
other
than
rule
of
thumb
solutions
he
engaged
a
man
in
answering
the
questionnaire
which
the
new
york
bureau
of
occupations
sent
to
one
hundred
and
industrial
plants
the
manager
in
almost
every
case
replied
in
regard
to
the
possibility
of
employing
women
in
such
positions
as
research
or
control
chemists
that
applicants
were
badly
prepared
as
hand
workers
too
women
are
handicapped
by
lack
of
knowledge
of
machinery
in
this
tool
age
high
school
girls
are
cut
off
from
technical
education
although
they
are
destined
to
carry
on
in
large
measure
our
skilled
trades
i
am
told
that
in
germany
many
factories
had
to
close
because
only
women
were
available
as
managers
and
they
had
not
been
fitted
by
business
and
technical
schools
for
the
task
if
women
individually
are
looking
for
a
soft
place
if
they
are
afraid
as
one
manager
expressed
it
to
put
on
overalls
and
go
into
a
vat
even
when
their
country
is
so
in
need
of
their
service
it
is
futile
for
them
to
ask
collectively
for
equal
opportunity
and
equal
pay
if
they
individually
fail
to
prepare
as
for
a
life
work
regarding
themselves
as
but
temporarily
in
business
or
a
profession
their
collective
demand
upon
the
world
for
a
fair
field
and
no
favor
will
be
as
ineffective
as
illogical
the
doors
stand
wide
open
it
rests
with
women
themselves
as
to
whether
they
shall
enter
in
to
the
steady
appeals
of
the
employment
bureaus
backed
by
the
stern
facts
of
life
the
colleges
are
yielding
on
examination
i
found
that
curricula
are
already
being
modified
none
but
the
sorriest
pessimist
could
doubt
the
nature
of
the
final
outcome
on
realizing
the
pooling
of
brains
which
is
going
on
in
such
associations
as
the
intercollegiate
bureau
of
occupations
and
the
league
for
business
opportunities
they
work
to
the
end
of
having
young
women
not
only
soundly
prepared
for
the
new
openings
but
sensitive
to
the
demands
of
a
world
set
towards
stern
duty
not
only
is
there
call
for
a
pooling
of
brains
to
look
after
the
timid
and
unready
but
there
is
need
of
combination
to
open
the
gates
for
the
prepared
and
brave
few
who
cheered
the
red
cross
nurses
as
they
made
their
stirring
march
on
fifth
avenue
knew
that
those
devoted
women
would
on
entering
the
military
nurse
corps
find
themselves
the
only
nurses
among
the
allies
without
a
position
of
honor
the
humiliation
to
our
nurses
in
placing
them
below
the
orderlies
in
the
hospitals
is
not
only
a
blow
to
their
esprit
de
corps
but
a
definite
handicap
to
their
efficiency
a
nurse
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
nursing
staff
in
a
state
hospital
wrote
from
the
front
there
is
one
thing
the
nursing
committee
needs
to
work
for
and
work
hard
too
and
that
is
to
make
for
nurses
the
rank
of
lieutenant
the
canadians
have
it
why
not
the
americans
you
will
find
that
it
will
make
a
tremendous
difference
you
see
there
are
no
officers
in
our
nursing
personnel
one
of
our
staff
says
we
are
the
hired
extras
it
is
really
a
great
mistake
uncle
sam
may
merely
be
waiting
for
a
concentrated
drive
of
public
opinion
against
his
tardy
representatives
illustration
down
the
street
they
come
beginning
their
pilgrimage
of
alleviation
and
succor
on
the
battlefields
of
france
and
why
should
it
be
necessary
to
urge
that
while
scores
of
young
men
are
dashing
to
death
in
endeavors
to
learn
to
fly
there
are
women
unmobilized
who
know
how
to
soar
aloft
in
safety
they
have
never
it
is
true
been
submitted
to
laboratory
tests
in
twirlings
and
twistings
but
they
reach
the
zenith
two
carried
off
the
records
in
long
distance
flights
but
both
have
been
refused
admission
to
the
flying
corps
will
it
need
a
campaign
to
secure
for
our
army
this
efficient
service
must
women
pool
their
brains
to
have
ruth
law
spread
her
protecting
wings
over
our
boys
in
france
to
any
one
who
realizes
the
significance
of
the
military
situation
as
it
stands
and
who
is
cognizant
of
the
contrast
between
germany
use
of
her
entire
people
in
her
national
effort
and
the
slow
mobilization
of
among
the
allies
and
entire
lack
of
anything
worthy
the
name
of
mobilization
of
the
of
women
in
the
united
states
there
will
come
a
determination
to
bury
every
jealousy
between
woman
and
woman
all
prejudice
in
men
to
cut
red
tape
in
government
with
the
one
object
of
combining
all
resources
the
full
power
of
our
men
must
be
thrown
into
military
effort
and
then
if
as
a
nation
we
have
brains
to
pool
we
will
not
stand
niggling
but
will
throw
women
doctors
in
to
render
their
service
grant
to
the
nurse
corps
what
it
needs
to
ensure
efficiency
throw
open
the
technical
schools
to
girls
as
well
as
to
boys
modify
the
college
course
to
meet
the
facts
of
life
each
woman
unprepared
is
a
national
handicap
each
prejudice
blocking
the
use
of
is
treachery
to
our
cause
as
to
the
final
outcome
of
united
thought
and
group
action
among
women
no
one
can
doubt
contacts
will
rub
off
angles
capable
service
will
break
down
sex
prejudice
and
overcome
government
opposition
but
there
is
not
time
to
wait
for
the
slow
development
of
final
outcomes
women
must
pool
their
brains
against
their
own
shortcomings
and
in
favor
of
their
own
ability
to
back
up
their
country
now
and
here
ix
business
as
usual
it
is
a
platitude
to
say
that
america
is
the
most
extravagant
nation
on
earth
the
whole
world
tells
us
so
and
we
do
not
deny
it
being
indeed
a
bit
proud
of
the
fact
who
is
there
among
us
who
does
not
respond
with
sympathetic
understanding
to
the
defense
of
the
bride
reprimanded
for
extravagance
by
her
women
have
john
and
i
find
we
can
do
without
the
necessities
of
life
it
the
luxuries
we
must
have
one
of
the
obstacles
to
complete
mobilization
of
our
country
is
extravagance
and
at
the
center
of
this
national
failing
sits
the
american
woman
enthroned
europe
found
it
could
not
allow
luxury
trades
to
go
on
if
the
war
was
to
be
won
business
as
usual
is
not
in
harmony
with
victory
i
remember
the
first
time
i
heard
the
slogan
and
how
it
carried
me
and
everyone
else
away
the
zeppelins
had
visited
london
the
night
before
a
house
in
red
lion
mews
was
crushed
down
into
its
cellar
a
heap
of
ruins
every
pane
of
glass
was
shattered
in
the
hospitals
surrounding
queen
square
and
ploughed
deep
making
a
great
basin
in
the
center
of
the
grass
lay
the
remnants
of
the
bomb
that
had
buried
itself
in
the
heart
of
england
the
shops
along
theobald
road
were
wrecked
but
in
the
heaps
of
broken
glass
in
each
show
window
were
improvised
signs
such
as
do
sympathize
with
us
buy
something
the
sign
which
was
displayed
oftenest
read
business
as
usual
the
first
i
noticed
was
in
the
window
of
a
print
shop
the
owner
a
woman
i
talked
to
her
through
the
frame
of
the
shattered
glass
she
looked
very
pale
and
her
face
was
cut
but
she
and
everyone
else
was
calm
and
no
one
was
doing
business
as
usual
more
composedly
than
a
wee
tot
trudging
along
to
school
with
a
nasty
scratch
from
a
glass
splinter
on
her
chubby
cheek
business
as
usual
expressed
the
fine
spirit
the
courage
the
determination
of
a
people
as
the
sporting
motto
of
an
indomitable
race
it
was
very
splendid
but
war
is
not
a
sport
it
is
a
cold
hard
science
demanding
every
energy
of
the
nation
for
its
successful
pursuit
in
proportion
as
our
indulgence
in
luxury
has
been
greater
than
that
of
any
european
nation
our
challenge
to
every
business
must
be
the
more
insistent
there
must
be
a
straight
answer
to
two
questions
does
this
enterprise
render
direct
war
service
or
if
not
is
it
essential
to
the
of
our
citizens
but
the
discipline
will
not
come
from
the
gods
nor
will
our
government
readily
turn
taskmaster
the
effort
must
come
largely
as
growing
into
group
determination
to
win
the
war
and
the
conviction
that
it
is
impossible
to
achieve
victory
and
conserve
the
virility
of
our
people
if
any
considerable
part
of
the
community
devotes
its
time
energy
and
money
to
creating
useless
things
a
nation
can
make
good
in
this
cataclysm
only
if
it
centers
its
whole
power
on
the
two
objects
in
view
military
victory
and
husbanding
of
life
and
resources
at
home
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
the
act
of
creating
a
thing
does
not
include
only
the
processes
of
industry
the
act
of
buying
is
creative
the
riot
of
luxury
trades
in
the
united
states
will
not
end
so
long
as
the
american
woman
remains
a
steady
buyer
of
luxuries
the
mobilization
of
women
as
workers
is
no
more
essential
to
the
triumph
of
our
cause
than
the
mobilization
of
women
for
thrift
the
beginning
and
end
of
saving
in
america
rests
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
women
they
are
the
buyers
in
the
working
class
and
in
the
professional
class
among
the
wealthy
they
set
the
standard
of
living
practically
every
appeal
for
thrift
has
been
addressed
to
the
rich
i
am
not
referring
to
the
supply
of
channels
into
which
to
pour
savings
but
to
appeals
to
make
the
economies
which
will
furnish
the
means
to
buy
stamps
or
bonds
those
appeals
are
addressed
almost
wholly
to
the
as
for
example
suggestions
as
to
reducing
courses
at
dinner
or
cutting
out
that
fourth
meal
no
doubt
is
supposed
to
be
good
for
the
millionaire
soul
but
to
such
it
is
chiefly
recommended
i
think
as
an
example
sure
of
imitation
what
the
rich
do
other
women
will
follow
is
the
idea
but
the
steady
insistence
that
we
fight
in
this
war
for
democracy
has
put
into
the
minds
of
the
people
very
definite
demands
for
independence
and
for
freedom
in
such
a
democratic
world
the
newly
adopted
habits
of
the
wealthy
will
not
prove
widely
convincing
economy
needs
other
than
an
aristocratic
stimulus
illustration
how
can
business
be
as
usual
when
in
paris
there
are
about
of
these
small
workshops
where
a
woman
dips
bengal
fire
and
grenades
into
a
bath
of
paraffin
i
do
not
mean
to
the
value
of
economy
in
the
class
there
is
no
doubt
that
shop
windows
on
fifth
avenue
are
a
severe
commentary
upon
our
present
intelligence
and
earnestness
of
purpose
no
one
i
think
would
deny
that
it
would
be
a
service
if
the
woman
of
fashion
ceased
to
drape
fur
here
there
and
everywhere
on
her
gowns
except
where
she
might
really
need
the
thick
pelt
to
keep
her
warm
and
instead
saved
the
price
of
the
garment
which
serves
no
purpose
but
that
of
display
and
gave
the
money
in
liberty
bonds
to
buy
a
coat
for
some
soldier
or
food
for
a
starving
baby
abroad
and
overburdened
as
the
railways
are
with
freight
and
ordinary
passenger
traffic
i
am
sure
the
general
public
will
not
fail
to
appreciate
to
the
full
a
which
leads
patrons
of
private
cars
pullman
and
dining
coaches
to
abandon
their
undoubtedly
economy
among
the
rich
is
of
value
i
presume
few
would
gainsay
that
it
would
have
been
well
for
america
if
the
use
of
private
automobiles
had
long
since
ceased
and
the
labor
and
plants
used
in
their
making
turned
to
manufacturing
trucks
and
ambulances
but
while
not
inclined
to
belittle
the
work
of
any
possible
saving
and
on
the
part
of
those
of
wealth
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
fruitful
field
for
war
economy
lies
among
simple
people
thrift
waits
for
democratization
we
of
limited
means
hug
some
of
the
most
extravagant
of
habits
the
average
family
enjoys
none
of
the
fruits
of
coöperation
we
keep
each
to
our
isolated
family
group
while
the
richer
a
person
is
the
more
does
she
gather
under
her
roof
representatives
of
other
families
her
cook
may
come
from
the
berri
family
the
waitress
may
be
an
andersen
the
nurse
an
the
poor
might
well
practice
the
economy
of
fellowship
the
live
in
apartment
houses
where
the
economy
of
central
heating
is
practised
while
the
majority
of
the
poor
occupy
tenements
where
the
extravagance
of
the
individual
stove
is
indulged
in
the
saving
of
coal
is
urged
but
the
authorities
do
not
seek
to
secure
for
the
poor
the
comfort
of
the
true
method
of
fuel
saving
the
richer
a
family
is
the
more
it
saves
by
the
use
of
skilled
service
the
poor
clinging
to
their
prejudices
and
refusing
to
trust
one
another
do
not
profit
by
coöperative
buying
or
by
central
kitchens
run
by
experts
money
is
wasted
by
amateurish
selection
of
food
and
clothing
and
nutritive
values
are
squandered
by
poor
cooking
unfortunately
uncle
sam
does
not
suggest
how
many
war
saving
stamps
could
be
bought
as
a
result
of
economy
along
these
lines
the
woman
with
the
pay
envelope
may
democratize
thrift
she
knows
how
hard
it
is
to
earn
money
and
has
learned
to
make
her
wages
reach
a
long
way
then
too
she
has
it
brought
home
to
her
each
pay
day
that
health
is
capital
she
finds
that
it
is
economy
to
keep
well
for
lost
time
brings
a
light
pay
envelope
every
woman
who
keeps
herself
in
condition
is
making
a
war
saving
there
has
been
no
propaganda
as
yet
appealing
to
women
to
value
dress
according
to
durability
and
comfort
rather
than
according
to
its
prettiness
to
bow
to
no
fashion
which
means
the
lessening
of
power
to
corset
herself
as
fashion
dictates
to
prop
herself
on
high
heels
means
to
a
woman
just
so
much
lost
efficiency
and
even
the
most
thoughtless
if
appealed
to
for
national
saving
might
learn
to
turn
by
preference
in
dress
in
habits
in
recreation
to
the
simple
things
the
japanese
i
am
told
make
a
ceremony
of
going
out
from
the
city
to
enjoy
the
beauties
of
a
moonlight
night
we
go
to
a
stuffy
theatre
and
applaud
a
night
set
nature
gives
her
children
the
one
and
the
producer
charges
his
patrons
for
the
other
a
propaganda
of
democratic
war
economy
would
teach
us
to
delight
in
the
beauties
of
nature
in
making
the
change
from
business
as
usual
to
economy
europe
suffered
hardship
because
although
the
retrenchments
suggested
were
fairly
democratic
it
had
not
created
channels
into
which
savings
might
be
thrown
with
certainty
of
their
flowing
on
to
safe
expenditures
europe
was
not
ready
with
its
great
thrift
schemes
nor
had
the
adjustments
been
made
which
would
enable
a
shop
to
turn
out
a
needed
uniform
let
us
say
in
place
of
a
useless
dress
definite
use
of
savings
has
been
provided
for
in
the
united
states
the
government
needs
goods
of
every
kind
to
make
our
military
effort
successful
camps
must
be
built
for
training
the
soldiers
uniforms
guns
and
ammunition
supplied
transportation
on
land
and
sea
is
called
for
the
government
needs
money
to
carry
on
the
industries
essential
to
winning
the
war
if
a
plucky
girl
who
works
in
a
button
factory
refuses
to
buy
an
ornament
which
she
at
first
thought
of
getting
to
decorate
her
belt
and
puts
that
cents
into
a
war
saving
stamp
all
in
the
spirit
of
backing
up
her
man
at
the
front
she
will
not
find
herself
thrown
out
of
employment
instead
while
demands
for
unnecessary
ornamental
fastenings
will
gradually
cease
she
will
be
kept
busy
on
government
orders
profiting
by
the
errors
of
those
nations
who
had
to
blaze
out
new
paths
the
united
states
knit
into
law
a
few
months
after
the
declaration
of
war
not
only
the
quick
drafting
of
its
for
military
service
but
methods
of
absorbing
the
people
savings
if
we
neither
waste
nor
hoard
we
will
not
suffer
as
did
europe
from
unemployment
there
is
more
work
to
be
done
than
our
available
can
meet
there
is
nothing
to
fear
from
the
curtailment
of
luxury
our
danger
lies
in
lack
of
a
sound
definition
of
extravagance
uncle
sam
could
get
more
by
appeals
to
simple
folk
than
by
homilies
preached
to
the
rich
the
great
war
is
a
conflict
between
the
ideals
of
the
peoples
is
a
people
war
and
with
women
as
half
the
people
the
savings
made
to
support
the
war
must
needs
then
be
made
by
the
people
for
the
people
there
has
been
no
compelling
propaganda
to
that
end
the
suggestion
of
mere
cutting
down
may
be
a
valuable
goal
to
set
for
the
but
it
is
not
a
mark
to
be
hit
by
those
already
down
to
bed
rock
the
only
saving
possible
to
those
living
on
narrow
margins
is
by
coöperation
civil
or
state
it
is
a
mad
extravagance
for
instance
to
kill
with
autos
children
at
play
in
the
streets
a
saving
of
life
could
easily
be
achieved
through
group
action
by
securing
children
attendants
by
opening
on
the
roofs
of
churches
and
public
buildings
by
shutting
off
streets
dedicated
to
the
sacred
right
of
children
to
play
this
would
be
a
war
saving
touching
the
heart
and
the
enthusiasm
of
the
people
central
municipal
heating
is
not
a
wild
dream
but
a
recognized
economy
in
many
places
municipal
kitchens
are
not
vague
surmisings
but
facts
achieved
in
the
towns
of
europe
they
are
forms
of
war
thrift
in
america
no
such
converting
examples
of
economy
are
as
yet
given
and
not
an
appeal
has
been
made
to
women
to
save
through
solidarity
uncle
sam
has
been
commendably
quick
and
wise
in
offering
a
reservoir
to
hold
the
tiny
savings
but
slow
in
starting
a
democratic
propaganda
suggesting
ways
of
saving
the
pennies
if
business
as
usual
is
a
poor
motto
so
is
life
as
usual
habits
as
usual
x
as
mother
used
to
do
man
admiration
for
things
as
mother
used
to
do
them
is
as
great
an
obstacle
as
business
as
usual
in
the
path
of
winning
the
war
and
husbanding
the
race
the
glamour
surrounding
the
economic
feats
of
mother
in
the
past
hides
the
shortcomings
of
today
i
once
saw
one
of
her
old
fortresses
a
manor
home
where
in
bygone
days
she
had
reigned
supreme
in
the
court
yard
was
the
smoke
house
where
she
cured
meat
and
fish
in
the
cellar
were
the
caldrons
and
vats
where
long
ago
she
tried
tallow
and
brewed
beer
and
there
were
all
the
utensils
for
dealing
with
flax
in
the
garret
i
saw
the
spindles
for
spinning
cotton
and
wool
and
the
hand
looms
for
weaving
the
homespun
in
her
day
mother
was
a
great
creator
of
wealth
but
then
an
economic
earthquake
came
foundations
were
shaken
the
roof
was
torn
off
her
domestic
workshop
steam
and
machinery
like
cyclones
carried
away
her
industries
and
nothing
was
left
to
her
but
odds
and
ends
of
occupations
toiling
in
the
family
circle
from
the
days
of
the
cave
dwellers
mother
had
become
so
intimately
associated
in
the
tribal
mind
with
the
hearthstone
that
the
home
was
called
her
sphere
around
this
segregation
accumulated
accretions
of
opinion
layer
on
layer
emanating
from
the
mind
of
her
mate
let
us
call
the
accretions
the
adamistic
theory
its
authors
happened
to
be
the
government
and
could
use
the
public
treasury
in
furtherance
of
publicity
for
their
ideas
set
forth
in
hieroglyphics
cut
in
stone
or
written
in
plain
english
and
printed
on
the
front
page
of
an
american
daily
one
of
the
few
occupations
left
to
mother
after
the
disruption
of
her
sphere
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
the
preparation
of
food
in
the
minds
of
men
food
from
its
seed
sowing
up
to
its
mastication
has
always
been
associated
with
woman
mention
food
and
the
average
man
thinks
of
mother
that
is
the
adam
in
him
and
so
quite
naturally
one
must
first
consider
this
relation
of
women
to
food
in
the
adamistic
theory
illustration
countess
de
berkaim
and
her
canteen
in
the
gare
de
lazarre
paris
when
the
world
under
war
conditions
asked
to
be
fed
adam
running
true
to
his
theory
pointed
to
mother
as
the
source
of
supply
and
declared
with
an
emphasis
that
came
of
implicit
faith
that
the
universe
need
want
for
nothing
if
each
woman
would
eliminate
waste
in
her
kitchen
and
become
a
voluntary
and
obedient
reflector
of
the
decisions
of
state
and
national
food
authorities
this
solution
presupposed
a
highly
developed
sense
of
community
devotion
in
women
running
hand
in
hand
with
entire
lack
of
gift
for
community
action
woman
it
was
expected
would
display
more
than
her
proverbial
lack
of
logic
by
embracing
with
enthusiasm
state
direction
and
at
the
same
time
remain
an
exemplar
of
individualistic
performance
the
adamistic
scheme
seems
still
further
to
demand
for
its
smooth
working
that
the
feminine
group
show
and
agree
that
it
is
not
itself
suited
to
reason
out
general
plans
it
is
within
the
range
of
possibility
however
that
no
comprehensive
scheme
of
food
conservation
or
effective
saving
in
any
line
can
be
imposed
on
women
without
consulting
them
the
negro
who
agreed
dat
de
colored
folk
should
keep
in
dar
places
touched
a
fundamental
note
in
human
nature
sex
as
well
as
racial
boundaries
when
he
added
and
de
colored
folk
must
do
de
placin
it
might
seem
to
run
counter
to
this
bit
of
wisdom
for
women
to
be
told
that
the
welfare
of
the
world
depends
upon
them
and
then
for
no
woman
to
be
given
administrative
power
to
mobilize
the
group
but
the
contest
between
man
devotion
to
the
habits
of
his
ancestry
in
the
female
line
and
the
ideas
of
his
very
living
women
folk
is
as
trying
to
him
as
it
is
interesting
to
the
outside
observer
the
conflicting
forces
illustrate
a
universal
fact
it
is
always
true
that
the
ruling
class
when
a
discipline
and
a
sacrifice
are
recognized
as
necessary
endeavors
to
make
it
appear
that
the
new
obligation
should
be
shouldered
by
the
less
powerful
for
instance
to
take
an
illustration
quite
outside
the
domestic
circle
when
america
first
became
convinced
that
military
preparation
was
incumbent
upon
us
the
ruling
class
would
scarcely
discuss
conscription
much
less
adopt
universal
service
that
is
it
vetoed
in
many
states
laws
were
passed
putting
off
upon
children
in
the
schools
the
training
which
the
voting
adults
knew
the
nation
needed
in
the
same
way
when
food
falls
short
and
the
victualing
of
the
world
becomes
a
pressing
duty
the
governing
class
adopts
a
thesis
that
a
politically
group
can
by
saving
in
small
and
painful
ways
accumulate
the
extra
food
necessary
to
keep
the
world
from
starving
the
ruling
class
seeks
cover
in
primitive
ideas
accuses
eve
of
introducing
sin
into
the
world
and
calls
upon
her
to
mend
her
wasteful
ways
men
of
course
know
intellectually
that
much
food
is
a
factory
product
in
these
days
but
emotionally
they
have
a
picture
of
mother
still
supplying
the
family
in
a
complete
secret
and
silent
manner
this
adamistic
emotion
takes
command
at
the
crisis
for
when
human
beings
are
suddenly
faced
with
a
new
and
agitating
situation
primitive
ideas
seize
them
mother
it
is
true
did
create
the
goods
for
immediate
consumption
and
so
the
sons
of
adam
in
a
spirit
of
admiration
doffing
their
helmets
so
to
speak
to
the
primitive
woman
turn
in
this
time
of
stress
and
call
confidently
upon
eve
daughters
to
create
and
save
the
confidence
is
touching
but
perhaps
the
feminine
reaction
will
not
be
and
perchance
ought
not
to
be
just
such
as
adam
expects
women
have
passed
in
aspiration
and
to
some
extent
in
action
out
of
the
stage
of
civilization
the
food
propaganda
reflects
the
hiatus
in
adam
thought
i
have
looked
over
hundreds
of
publications
issued
by
the
agricultural
departments
and
colleges
of
the
various
states
they
tell
housewives
what
to
put
into
the
garbage
pail
what
to
keep
out
of
the
garbage
pail
what
to
substitute
for
wheat
how
to
make
soap
but
with
a
single
exception
not
a
word
issued
suggests
to
women
any
saving
through
group
action
this
exception
which
stood
out
as
a
beacon
light
in
an
ocean
of
literature
worthy
of
the
stone
age
was
a
small
pamphlet
issued
by
the
michigan
agricultural
college
on
luncheons
in
rural
schools
sound
doctrine
was
preached
on
the
need
of
the
children
for
substantial
and
warm
noon
meals
and
the
comparative
ease
and
economy
with
which
such
luncheons
could
be
provided
at
the
school
house
children
can
of
course
be
better
and
more
cheaply
fed
as
a
group
than
as
isolated
units
supplied
with
a
cold
lunch
box
and
yet
with
the
whole
machinery
of
the
state
in
his
hands
adam
commissions
backed
by
the
people
money
goad
mother
on
to
isolated
endeavor
she
plants
and
weeds
and
harvests
she
dries
and
cans
preserves
and
pickles
then
she
calculates
and
perchance
finds
that
her
finished
product
is
not
always
of
the
best
and
has
often
cost
more
than
if
purchased
in
the
open
market
it
may
be
the
truest
devotion
to
our
allies
to
challenge
the
individualistic
rôle
recommended
by
adam
to
mother
for
it
will
hinder
not
help
the
feeding
of
the
world
to
put
women
back
under
eighteenth
century
conditions
food
is
short
and
expensive
because
labor
is
short
and
even
when
the
harvest
is
ripe
the
saving
of
food
can
not
be
set
as
a
separate
and
commendable
goal
and
the
choice
as
to
where
labor
shall
be
expended
as
negligible
it
is
a
prejudiced
devotion
to
mother
and
her
ways
which
leads
adam
in
his
food
pamphlets
to
advise
that
a
woman
shall
sit
in
her
chimney
corner
and
spend
time
peeling
a
peach
very
thin
when
hundreds
of
bushels
of
peaches
rot
in
the
orchards
for
lack
of
hands
to
pick
them
just
how
wide
adam
eve
has
opened
the
gate
of
eden
and
looked
out
into
the
big
world
is
not
entirely
clear
but
probably
wide
enough
to
glimpse
the
fact
that
all
the
advice
adam
has
recently
given
to
her
runs
counter
to
man
method
of
achievement
men
have
preached
to
one
another
for
a
hundred
years
and
more
and
practiced
so
successfully
the
concentration
in
industry
of
unlimited
machinery
with
a
few
hands
that
even
mother
knows
some
of
the
truths
in
regard
to
the
creation
of
wealth
in
the
business
world
and
she
is
probably
not
incapable
of
drawing
a
conclusion
from
her
own
experience
in
the
transfer
of
work
from
the
home
to
the
factory
if
they
are
city
dwellers
women
have
seen
bread
and
preserves
transferred
if
farm
dwellers
they
have
seen
the
curing
of
meat
and
fish
transferred
the
making
of
butter
and
cheese
they
know
that
because
of
this
transfer
the
home
is
cleaner
and
quieter
more
people
better
fed
and
clothed
and
the
hours
of
the
factory
worker
made
shorter
than
those
mother
used
to
work
with
half
an
eye
women
can
not
fail
to
note
that
the
labor
which
used
to
be
occupied
in
the
home
in
interminable
hours
of
spinning
baking
and
preserving
has
come
to
occupy
itself
for
regulated
periods
in
the
school
in
business
in
factory
or
cannery
and
lo
eve
finds
herself
with
a
pay
envelope
able
to
help
support
the
quieter
cleaner
home
all
this
is
a
commonplace
to
the
business
man
who
knows
that
the
evolution
has
gone
so
far
that
ten
percent
of
the
married
women
of
america
are
in
gainful
pursuits
and
that
capital
ventured
on
apartment
hotels
brings
a
tempting
return
but
the
adamistic
theory
is
based
on
the
dream
that
women
are
contentedly
and
efficiently
conducting
in
their
flats
many
occupations
and
longing
to
receive
back
into
the
life
around
the
all
those
industries
which
in
years
gone
by
were
drawn
from
the
fireside
and
established
as
money
making
projects
in
mill
or
and
so
adam
addresses
an
exhortation
to
his
eve
do
buy
bread
bake
it
buy
flour
grind
your
own
do
buy
soap
make
it
do
buy
canned
preserved
or
dried
food
carry
on
the
processes
yourself
do
buy
fruits
and
vegetables
raise
them
not
a
doubt
seems
to
exist
in
adam
mind
as
to
the
efficiency
of
functioning
in
this
way
according
to
the
adamistic
theory
work
as
mother
used
to
do
it
is
unqualifiedly
perfect
this
flattering
faith
is
naturally
balm
to
women
hearts
and
yet
there
are
skeptics
among
them
when
quite
by
themselves
women
speculate
as
to
how
much
of
the
fruit
and
vegetables
now
put
up
in
the
home
will
work
they
smile
when
the
hope
is
expressed
that
the
quality
will
rise
above
the
domestic
standard
the
home
of
the
past
was
a
beehive
in
which
women
drudged
and
little
children
were
weary
toilers
and
the
result
was
not
of
a
high
grade
statistics
have
shown
that
percent
of
the
bread
of
america
was
a
poor
product
i
lived
as
a
child
in
the
days
of
bread
once
in
so
often
the
batch
of
bread
went
sour
and
there
seemed
to
be
an
unfailing
supply
of
stale
bread
which
must
be
eaten
first
those
who
cry
out
against
a
city
of
bakers
bread
have
never
lived
in
a
country
of
the
loaf
it
is
the
adamistic
philosophy
so
complimentary
to
eve
that
leads
us
to
expect
that
all
housewives
can
turn
out
a
product
as
good
as
that
of
an
expert
who
has
specialized
to
the
one
end
of
making
bread
and
who
is
supplied
with
expensive
equipment
beyond
the
reach
of
the
individual
to
possess
but
there
are
rebellious
consumers
who
point
out
that
the
baker
is
under
the
law
while
the
housewife
is
a
law
unto
herself
against
the
baker
shortcomings
such
brave
doubters
assure
us
we
have
redress
we
can
refuse
to
patronize
him
against
the
housewife
there
is
no
appeal
her
family
must
swallow
her
product
to
the
detriment
of
digestion
it
may
be
the
brutal
truth
taking
bread
as
the
index
that
only
a
quarter
of
the
processes
carried
on
in
the
home
turn
out
satisfactorily
while
of
the
other
a
just
verdict
may
show
that
mother
gets
a
little
too
much
lye
in
the
soap
cooks
the
preserves
a
little
too
hard
candies
the
fruit
just
a
little
bit
and
grinds
the
flour
in
the
mill
not
quite
fine
enough
but
perhaps
even
more
than
the
quality
of
the
product
does
the
question
of
the
economical
disposition
of
agitate
some
women
they
are
asking
since
labor
is
very
scarce
whether
the
extreme
individualistic
direction
of
their
is
permissible
the
vast
majority
of
american
homes
are
without
servants
in
those
homes
are
the
women
working
such
short
hours
that
they
can
without
dropping
important
obligations
take
over
preserving
canning
dehydrating
the
making
of
bread
soap
and
butter
substitute
has
the
dweller
accommodation
suitable
for
introducing
these
industrial
processes
into
her
home
would
the
woman
in
the
small
ménage
in
the
country
be
wise
in
cutting
down
time
given
for
instance
to
the
care
of
her
baby
and
to
reading
to
the
older
children
and
using
the
precious
moments
laboriously
to
grind
wheat
to
flour
my
observation
convinces
me
that
conscientious
housewives
in
servantless
or
households
with
work
adjusted
to
a
given
end
with
relative
values
already
determined
upon
are
not
prepared
by
acceptance
of
the
adamistic
theory
to
return
to
primitive
occupations
but
even
if
business
and
home
life
could
respond
to
the
change
without
strain
even
if
both
could
easily
turn
back
on
the
road
they
have
come
during
the
last
hundred
years
commerce
yielding
up
and
the
home
certain
occupations
we
should
carefully
weigh
the
economic
value
of
a
reversion
to
primitive
methods
the
adamistic
attitude
is
influenced
perhaps
unconsciously
but
no
less
certainly
by
the
fact
that
the
housewife
is
an
unpaid
worker
if
an
unpaid
person
volunteers
to
do
a
thing
it
is
readily
assumed
that
the
particular
effort
is
worth
while
we
get
the
labor
for
nothing
puts
to
rout
all
thought
of
valuation
no
doubt
adam
will
have
to
give
over
thinking
in
this
loose
way
whether
it
is
paid
for
or
not
must
be
used
wisely
or
we
shall
not
be
able
to
maintain
the
structure
of
our
civilization
then
too
the
adamistic
theory
weighs
and
values
the
housewife
time
as
little
as
it
questions
the
quality
of
the
home
product
any
careful
reader
of
the
various
hints
to
housewives
which
have
appeared
will
note
that
the
simplifying
of
meals
recommended
would
require
nearly
double
the
time
to
prepare
the
simplification
takes
into
consideration
only
the
question
of
food
substitutions
price
and
waste
mother
is
supposed
to
be
wholly
or
largely
unemployed
and
longing
for
unpaid
toil
should
any
housewife
conscientiously
follow
the
advice
given
her
by
state
and
municipal
authorities
she
would
be
the
drudge
at
the
center
of
a
home
quite
medieval
in
development
let
us
take
a
concrete
example
in
a
recently
published
and
widely
applauded
cookbook
put
out
by
a
whole
committee
of
adamistic
philosophers
it
is
stated
that
the
object
of
the
book
is
to
give
practical
hints
as
to
the
various
ways
in
which
economies
can
be
effected
and
waste
saved
and
yet
no
saving
of
the
woman
time
nerves
and
muscles
is
referred
to
from
cover
to
cover
the
housewife
is
told
for
instance
to
insist
upon
getting
the
meat
trimmings
the
fat
can
be
rendered
and
then
follows
the
process
in
mother
is
to
place
the
scraps
of
fat
on
the
back
of
the
stove
if
she
watches
it
carefully
and
does
not
allow
it
to
get
hot
enough
to
smoke
there
will
be
no
odor
no
doubt
if
she
removes
her
watchful
eye
and
turns
to
bathe
her
baby
her
tenement
will
reek
with
smoking
fat
she
is
to
pursue
this
trying
of
fat
and
nerves
day
by
day
until
she
has
six
pounds
of
grease
next
she
is
to
stir
it
well
cool
it
melt
it
again
she
is
then
to
pour
in
the
lye
slowly
stirring
all
the
time
add
ammonia
then
stir
the
mixture
constantly
for
twenty
minutes
or
half
an
hour
in
contrast
to
all
this
primeval
elaboration
is
the
simple
rule
do
not
buy
the
trimmings
make
the
butcher
trim
meat
before
weighing
insist
that
shall
not
be
brought
back
to
defile
the
home
but
remain
where
it
belongs
a
trade
in
which
the
workers
can
be
protected
by
law
and
its
malodorousness
brought
under
regulation
in
the
same
spirit
the
adamistic
suggestion
to
eve
to
save
coal
by
a
heatless
day
is
met
by
the
cold
challenge
of
the
riotous
extravagance
of
cooking
in
twelve
separate
tenements
twelve
separate
potatoes
on
twelve
separate
fires
the
adamistic
theory
through
its
emphasis
on
the
relation
of
food
to
eve
and
the
almost
religious
necessity
of
its
manipulation
at
the
altar
of
the
home
has
drawn
thought
away
from
the
nutritive
side
of
what
we
eat
while
the
child
in
the
streets
is
tossing
about
such
words
as
calories
and
carbohydrates
with
a
glibness
that
comes
of
much
hearing
physiology
and
food
values
are
destined
to
remain
as
far
away
as
ever
from
the
average
family
breakfast
table
segregating
a
sex
in
the
home
it
is
true
centralizes
it
in
a
given
place
but
it
does
not
necessarily
train
the
individual
to
function
efficiently
mother
as
she
used
to
do
cooks
by
rule
of
thumb
in
fact
how
could
she
do
otherwise
since
she
must
keep
one
eye
on
her
approving
adam
while
the
other
eye
glances
at
the
oven
the
adamistic
theory
requires
individualistic
action
and
disapproves
specialization
in
eve
the
theory
also
demands
economic
dependence
in
the
home
builder
mother
labor
is
not
her
own
she
lives
under
the
truck
system
so
to
speak
she
is
paid
in
kind
for
her
work
influenced
by
the
adamistic
theory
the
human
animal
is
the
only
species
in
which
sex
and
economic
relations
are
closely
linked
the
only
one
in
which
the
female
depends
upon
the
male
for
sustenance
mother
must
give
personal
service
to
those
about
her
and
in
return
the
law
ensures
her
keep
according
to
the
station
of
her
husband
that
is
not
according
to
her
ability
or
usefulness
but
according
to
the
man
earning
capacity
the
close
association
of
mother
with
home
in
the
philosophy
of
her
mate
has
circumscribed
her
most
natural
and
modest
attempts
at
relaxation
mother
holiday
is
a
thing
to
draw
tears
from
those
who
contemplate
it
the
summer
outing
means
carrying
the
family
from
one
spot
to
another
and
making
the
best
of
new
surroundings
for
the
old
group
the
day
off
means
a
concentration
of
the
usual
toil
into
a
few
hours
followed
by
a
hazy
passing
show
that
she
is
too
weary
to
enjoy
the
kindly
farmer
takes
his
wife
this
year
to
the
county
fair
she
up
at
four
to
get
on
with
the
work
she
serves
breakfast
gives
the
children
an
extra
polish
in
honor
of
the
day
puts
on
the
clean
frocks
and
suits
with
an
admonition
not
to
get
all
mussed
up
before
the
start
the
farmer
cheerily
counsels
haste
in
order
that
we
may
have
a
good
long
day
of
it
he
does
not
say
what
it
is
but
the
wife
knows
at
last
the
house
is
ready
to
be
left
and
the
wife
and
her
brood
are
ready
to
settle
down
in
the
farm
wagon
the
fair
grounds
are
reached
adam
has
prepared
the
setting
it
has
no
relation
to
mother
needs
it
was
a
most
thrilling
innovation
when
in
the
summer
of
the
women
political
union
first
set
up
big
tents
at
county
fairs
fitted
with
comfortable
chairs
for
mother
and
cots
and
toys
nurses
and
companions
for
the
children
the
farmer
wife
for
the
first
time
was
relieved
of
care
and
could
go
off
to
see
the
sights
with
her
mind
at
rest
if
she
desired
anything
more
active
than
rocking
lazily
with
the
delicious
sensation
of
having
nothing
to
do
women
must
not
blame
adam
for
lack
of
thoughtfulness
he
can
not
put
himself
in
mother
place
she
must
do
her
own
thinking
or
let
women
who
are
capable
of
thought
do
it
for
her
men
are
relieved
when
mother
is
independent
and
happy
the
farmer
approved
the
crèche
tent
at
the
county
fairs
it
convinced
him
that
women
have
ideas
to
contribute
to
the
of
the
community
the
venture
proved
the
greatest
of
vote
getters
for
the
suffrage
referendum
in
fact
men
themselves
are
the
chief
opponents
of
the
adamistic
theory
the
majority
want
women
to
organize
the
home
and
it
is
only
a
small
minority
who
place
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
wider
functioning
of
women
it
is
eve
herself
who
likes
to
exaggerate
the
necessity
of
her
personal
service
i
have
seen
many
a
primitive
housewife
grow
hot
at
the
suggestion
that
her
methods
need
modifying
it
seemed
like
severing
the
silken
cords
by
which
she
held
her
mate
to
challenge
her
pumpkin
pie
but
women
are
slowly
overcoming
eve
take
the
item
of
the
care
of
children
in
city
parks
the
old
way
is
for
fifty
women
to
look
after
fifty
separate
children
and
thus
waste
the
time
of
some
thirty
of
them
in
keeping
fifty
miserable
children
in
segregation
the
new
way
now
successfully
initiated
is
to
form
play
groups
of
happy
children
under
the
leadership
of
capable
young
women
trained
for
such
work
salvaging
new
york
city
food
waste
was
a
very
splendid
bit
of
coöperative
action
on
the
part
of
women
william
lough
of
the
women
university
club
found
on
investigation
that
thousands
of
tons
of
good
food
are
lost
by
a
condemnation
necessarily
rough
and
ready
by
the
board
of
health
she
secured
permission
to
have
the
sound
and
unsound
fruits
and
vegetables
separated
and
with
a
large
committee
of
women
saved
the
food
for
consumption
by
the
community
by
dehydrating
and
other
preserving
processes
this
was
not
as
mother
used
to
do
mother
ways
are
being
investigated
and
discarded
the
whole
world
round
at
last
accounts
half
the
population
of
hamburg
was
being
fed
through
municipal
kitchens
and
in
great
britain
an
order
has
been
issued
by
lord
rhondda
the
food
controller
authorizing
local
authorities
to
open
kitchens
as
food
distributing
centers
the
central
government
is
to
bear
percent
of
the
cost
of
equipment
and
lend
another
percent
to
start
the
enterprise
mother
cook
stove
can
not
bear
the
strain
of
war
economies
dropping
their
old
segregation
women
are
going
forth
in
fellowship
with
men
to
meet
in
new
ways
the
pressing
problems
of
a
new
world
xi
a
land
army
great
britain
france
and
germany
have
mobilized
a
land
army
of
women
will
the
united
states
do
less
not
if
the
farmer
can
be
brought
to
have
as
much
faith
in
american
women
as
the
women
have
in
themselves
and
why
should
they
not
have
faith
the
farm
has
already
tested
them
out
and
they
have
not
been
found
wanting
in
face
of
this
fine
accomplishment
the
minds
of
some
men
still
entertain
doubt
or
worse
obliviousness
to
the
possible
contribution
of
women
to
land
service
the
farmer
knows
his
need
and
has
made
clear
statement
of
the
national
dilemma
in
the
form
of
a
memorial
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
part
it
is
as
follows
if
food
is
to
win
the
war
as
we
are
assured
on
every
side
the
farmers
of
america
must
produce
more
food
in
than
they
did
in
under
existing
conditions
we
can
not
equal
the
production
of
much
less
surpass
it
and
this
for
reasons
over
which
the
farmers
have
no
control
the
chief
causes
which
will
inevitably
bring
about
a
smaller
crop
next
year
unless
promptly
removed
by
national
action
are
six
in
number
of
which
the
first
is
the
shortage
of
farm
labor
since
the
war
began
in
and
before
the
first
draft
was
made
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
more
farm
workers
had
left
farms
than
there
are
men
in
our
army
and
navy
together
those
men
were
drawn
away
by
the
high
wages
paid
in
munition
plants
and
other
war
industries
and
their
places
remain
unfilled
in
spite
of
the
new
classification
future
drafts
will
still
further
reduce
the
farm
labor
supply
with
a
million
and
a
half
men
drawn
out
of
the
country
and
ten
billion
dollars
to
be
expended
on
war
material
making
every
ammunition
factory
a
labor
magnet
it
seems
like
the
smooth
deceptions
of
prestidigitation
to
answer
the
cry
of
the
farmer
with
suggestion
that
men
rejected
by
the
draft
or
high
school
boys
be
paroled
to
meet
the
exigency
the
farm
ca
be
run
with
decrepit
men
or
larking
boys
nor
the
war
won
with
less
than
its
full
quota
of
soldiers
legislators
government
officials
and
farm
associations
by
sudden
shifting
of
labor
battalions
can
not
camouflage
the
fact
that
the
front
line
trenches
of
the
fighting
army
and
labor
force
are
undermanned
women
can
and
will
be
the
substitutes
if
the
experiments
already
made
are
signs
of
the
times
groups
of
women
from
colleges
and
seasonal
trades
have
ploughed
and
harrowed

planted
weeded

and
mahwah
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
our
girls
from

and

trade
can
do
farm
work
and
do
it
with
a
will
and
still
better
at

of

their
health
wins
high
approval
from

the
students
who
volunteered
for
dangerous
service
during
a
summer
vacation
on
the
vassar
college
farm
the
twelve
ventured
out
on
a
new
enterprise
that
meant
aching
muscles
sunburn
and
blisters
but
not
one
of
the
twelve
ever
lost
a
day
in
their
eight
hours
at
hard
labor
beginning
at
each
morning
for
eight
weeks
during
one
of
our
hottest
summers
they
ploughed
with
horses
they
ploughed
with
tractors
they
sowed
the
seed
they
thinned
and
weeded
the
plants
they
reaped
they
raked
they
pitched
the
hay
they
did
fencing
and
milking
the
vassar
farm
had
bumper
crops
on
its
seven
hundred
and
forty
acres
and
its
superintendent
louis
gillespie
said
a
very
great
amount
of
the
work
necessary
for
the
large
production
was
done
by
our
students
they
hoed
and
cultivated
sixteen
acres
of
field
corn
ten
acres
of
ensilage
corn
five
acres
of
beans
five
acres
of
potatoes
carried
sheaves
of
rye
and
wheat
to
the
shocks
and
shocked
them
and
two
of
the
students
milked
seven
cows
at
each
milking
time
in
the
garden
they
laid
out
a
strawberry
bed
of
two
thousand
plants
helped
to
plant
corn
and
beans
picked
beans
and
other
vegetables
they
took
great
interest
in
the
work
and
did
the
work
just
as
well
as
the
average
man
and
made
good
far
beyond
the
most
sanguine
expectations
at
first
the
students
were
paid
cents
an
hour
the
same
rate
as
the
male
farm
hands
the
men
objected
saying
that
the
young
women
were
beginners
but
by
the
end
of
the
summer
the
critics
realized
that
brains
tell
and
said
the
girls
were
worth
the
higher
wage
though
they
had
only
been
getting
in
order
to
appease
the
masculine
prejudice
seventeen
and
a
half
cents
an
hour
there
is
no
pleasing
some
people
if
women
are
paid
less
they
are
unfair
competitors
if
they
are
paid
equally
they
are
being
petted
in
short
fair
competitors
mt
holyoke
and
bryn
mawr
have
made
experiments
and
like
vassar
demonstrated
not
only
that
women
can
and
that
satisfactorily
work
on
the
land
but
that
they
will
and
that
cheerfully
the
groups
were
happy
and
they
comprehended
that
they
were
doing
transcendently
important
work
were
rendering
a
patriotic
service
by
filling
up
the
places
left
vacant
by
the
drafted
men
the
women
agricultural
camp
known
popularly
as
the
bedford
unit
proved
an
experiment
rich
in
practical
suggestion
barnard
students
graduates
of
the
manhattan
trade
school
and
girls
from
seasonal
trades
formed
the
backbone
of
the
group
they
were
housed
in
an
old
farmhouse
chaperoned
by
one
of
the
barnard
professors
fed
by
student
dietitians
from
the
household
arts
department
of
teachers
college
transported
from
farm
to
farm
by
seven
chauffeurs
and
coached
in
the
arts
of
ceres
by
an
agricultural
expert
the
day
laborers
as
well
as
the
experts
were
all
women
illustration
an
agricultural
unit
in
the
uniform
approved
by
the
land
army
of
america
in
founding
the
camp
charles
short
had
three
definite
ideas
in
mind
first
she
was
convinced
that
young
women
could
without
on
their
health
and
should
as
a
patriotic
service
do
all
sorts
of
agricultural
work
second
that
in
the
present
crisis
the
opening
up
of
new
land
with
women
as
farm
managers
is
not
called
for
but
rather
the
supply
of
the
on
farms
already
under
cultivation
is
the
need
third
that
the
women
laborers
must
in
groups
have
comfortable
living
conditions
without
being
a
burden
on
the
farmer
wife
must
have
adequate
pay
and
must
have
regulated
hours
of
work
with
these
sound
ideas
as
its
foundation
the
camp
opened
at
mt
kisco
backed
by
the
committee
on
agriculture
of
the
mayor
committee
of
women
on
national
defense
of
new
york
city
under
the
chairmanship
of
virginia
gildersleeve
dean
of
barnard
college
at
its
greatest
enrolment
the
unit
had
members
when
the
prejudice
of
the
fanners
was
overcome
the
demand
for
workers
was
greater
than
the
camp
could
supply
practically
the
same
processes
were
carried
through
as
at
vassar
and
the
verdict
of
the
farmer
on
his
new
helpers
was
that
while
less
strong
than
men
they
more
than
made
up
for
this
by
superior
conscientiousness
and
quickness
proof
of
the
genuineness
of
his
estimate
was
shown
in
his
willingness
to
pay
the
management
of
the
camp
the
regulation
two
dollars
for
an
eight
hour
working
day
and
it
indicated
entire
satisfaction
with
the
experiment
rather
than
abstract
faith
in
woman
that
each
farmer
anxiously
urged
the
captain
of
the
group
at
the
end
of
his
first
trial
to
please
bring
the
same
young
ladies
tomorrow
he
was
sure
no
others
so
good
existed
the
unit
plan
seems
a
solution
of
many
of
the
knotty
problems
of
the
farm
in
the
first
place
the
farmer
gets
cheerful
and
handy
helpers
and
his
wife
does
not
find
her
domestic
cares
added
to
in
the
hot
summer
season
the
new
hands
house
and
feed
themselves
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
worker
the
advantage
is
that
her
food
at
the
camp
is
prepared
by
trained
hands
and
the
proverbial
farm
isolation
gives
way
to
congenial
companionship
these
separate
experiments
growing
out
of
the
need
of
food
production
and
the
shortage
of
labor
have
brought
new
blood
to
the
farm
have
turned
the
college
girl
on
vacation
and
what
is
more
important
being
a
solution
of
an
industrial
problem
the
unemployed
in
seasonal
trades
into
recruits
for
an
agricultural
army
and
by
concentrating
workers
in
camps
there
has
been
attracted
to
the
land
a
higher
order
of
helper
one
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
immediate
success
of
putting
such
women
on
the
land
is
a
wholly
mistaken
idea
in
the
minds
of
many
persons
of
influence
in
agricultural
matters
that
the
new
labor
can
be
diverted
to
domestic
work
in
the
farm
house
this
view
is
urged
in
the
following
letter
to
me
from
the
head
of
one
of
our
best
agricultural
colleges
the
farm
labor
shortage
is
much
more
acute
than
is
generally
understood
and
i
have
much
confidence
in
the
possibility
of
a
great
amount
of
useful
work
in
food
production
being
done
by
women
who
are
physically
strong
enough
and
who
can
secure
sufficient
preliminary
training
to
do
this
with
some
degree
of
efficiency
probably
the
larger
measure
of
service
could
be
done
by
relieving
women
now
on
the
farms
of
this
state
from
the
double
burden
of
indoor
work
and
the
attempt
to
assist
in
farm
operations
and
chores
if
farm
women
would
get
satisfactory
domestic
assistance
within
the
house
they
could
add
much
to
the
success
of
field
husbandry
women
who
know
farm
conditions
and
who
could
largely
take
the
place
of
men
in
the
management
of
outdoor
affairs
can
accomplish
much
more
than
will
ever
be
possible
by
drafting
women
directly
into
garden
or
other
forms
of
field
work
the
opinions
expressed
in
this
letter
are
as
generally
held
as
they
are
mistaken
in
the
first
place
the
theory
that
the
woman
in
america
is
stronger
and
healthier
than
the
has
long
since
been
exploded
the
assumption
can
not
stand
up
under
the
facts
statistics
show
that
the
death
rate
in
the
united
states
is
lower
in
city
than
in
farm
communities
and
if
any
added
proof
were
needed
to
indicate
that
the
stamina
of
city
populations
overbalances
the
country
it
was
furnished
by
the
draft
records
any
group
of
college
and
manhattan
trade
school
girls
could
be
pitted
against
a
group
of
women
from
the
farms
and
win
the
laurels
in
staying
powers
nor
must
it
be
overlooked
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
uncertainties
the
mettle
of
the
girls
has
been
proved
in
any
case
the
fact
must
be
faced
that
these
agricultural
units
will
not
do
domestic
work
of
the
farm
houses
in
america
are
without
modern
conveniences
the
barn
may
have
running
water
but
the
house
has
not
to
undertake
work
as
a
domestic
helper
on
the
average
farm
is
to
step
back
into
quite
primitive
conditions
the
farmer
wife
can
attract
no
one
from
city
life
where
so
much
cooperation
is
enjoyed
to
her
extreme
individualistic
surroundings
a
second
obstacle
to
the
employment
of
this
new
is
due
to
the
government
failure
to
see
the
possibility
of
saving
most
valuable
and
achieving
an
economic
gain
by
dovetailing
the
idle
months
of
young
women
in
industrial
life
into
the
rush
time
of
agriculture
one
department
suggests
excusing
farm
labor
from
the
draft
as
if
we
had
already
fulfilled
our
obligation
in
to
the
battlefront
of
our
allies
the
united
states
senate
discusses
bringing
in
coolie
and
contract
labor
as
if
we
had
not
demonstrated
our
unfitness
to
deal
with
less
advanced
peoples
and
as
if
a
republic
could
live
comfortably
with
a
class
of
disfranchised
workers
the
labor
department
declares
it
will
mobilize
for
the
farm
an
army
of
a
million
boys
as
if
the
wise
saw
boys
will
be
boys
did
not
apply
with
peculiar
sharpness
of
flavor
to
the
american
vintage
god
bless
them
and
as
if
it
were
not
our
plain
duty
at
this
world
crisis
to
spur
up
rather
than
check
civilizing
agencies
and
keep
our
boys
in
school
for
the
full
term
refusing
to
be
in
the
least
crushed
by
government
neglect
women
determined
to
organize
widely
and
carefully
their
solution
of
the
problem
to
this
end
the
women
national
farm
and
garden
association
the
garden
clubs
of
america
the
young
women
christian
association
the
woman
suffrage
party
the
new
york
women
university
club
and
the
committee
of
the
women
agricultural
camp
met
with
representatives
of
the
grange
of
the
cornell
agricultural
college
and
of
the
farmingdale
state
school
of
agriculture
and
formed
an
advisory
council
the
object
of
which
is
to
stimulate
the
formation
of
a
land
army
of
women
to
take
the
places
on
the
farms
of
the
men
who
are
being
drafted
for
active
service
this
is
to
be
on
a
nationwide
scale
the
council
has
put
lecturers
in
the
granges
to
bring
to
the
farmer
by
the
spoken
word
and
lantern
slides
the
value
of
the
labor
of
women
and
is
appealing
to
colleges
seasonal
trades
and
village
communities
to
form
units
for
the
land
army
it
is
asking
the
coöperation
of
the
labor
bureaus
to
act
as
media
through
which
units
may
be
placed
where
labor
is
most
needed
this
mobilization
of
is
not
yet
large
or
striking
the
effort
is
entirely
civil
but
all
the
more
is
it
praiseworthy
it
shows
on
the
part
of
women
recognition
of
facts
as
they
exist
and
vision
as
to
the
future
the
mobilization
of
this
fresh
should
of
course
be
taken
in
hand
by
the
government
not
only
that
it
should
be
led
by
women
as
in
great
britain
and
germany
but
the
spirit
in
america
today
is
the
same
as
in
england
the
first
year
of
the
war
a
disposition
to
exclude
women
from
full
service
but
facts
remain
facts
in
spite
of
prejudice
and
the
woman
land
army
with
faith
and
enthusiasm
in
lieu
of
a
national
treasury
are
endeavoring
to
bring
and
the
untilled
fields
together
the
proved
achievement
of
the
individual
worker
will
win
the
employer
the
unit
plan
with
its
solution
of
housing
conditions
and
dreary
isolation
will
overcome
not
only
the
opposition
of
the
farmer
wife
but
that
of
the
intelligent
worker
when
the
seed
time
of
the
movement
has
been
lived
through
by
anxious
and
inspired
women
the
government
may
step
in
to
reap
the
harvest
of
a
nation
gratitude
the
mobilization
of
on
the
farm
is
the
need
of
the
hour
and
the
wise
and
devoted
women
who
are
trying
to
answer
the
need
deserve
an
from
the
people
of
the
united
states

her
allies
xii

part
in
saving
civilization
men
have
played
all
honor
to
them
the
major
part
in
the
actual
conflict
of
the
war
women
will
mobilize
for
the
major
part
of
binding
up
the
wounds
and
conserving
civilization
the
spirit
of
the
world
might
almost
be
supposed
to
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
day
and
clearly
seeing
its
needs
so
well
are
women
being
prepared
to
receive
and
carry
steadily
the
burden
which
will
be
laid
on
their
shoulders
for
of
a
century
schools
and
colleges
have
given
to
women
what
they
had
to
confer
in
the
way
of
discipline
gainful
pursuits
were
opened
up
to
them
adding
training
in
ordered
occupation
and
lastly
has
come
the
great
war
with
its
drill
in
sacrifice
and
economy
its
larger
opportunities
to
function
and
achieve
its
ideals
of

which
have
directly
and
quickly
led
to
the

enfranchisement

separated

has
prepared

to
share
fully
in
the
saving
of

whether

be
ours
in
the
immediate
future
or
whether
the
dangers
rising
so
clearly
on
the
horizon
develop
into
fresh
alignments
leading
to
years
of

civilization
stands
in
jeopardy

remain

the

which
are
necessary

reactions
are
in
danger
of
being
swept
away
we
have
been
destroying
the
life
the
wealth
and
beauty
of
the

the
nobility
of
our
aim
in
the

must
not
blind
us
to
the
awfulness
and
the
magnitude
of
the
destruction
in
the

there
are
at

involved
in

over
four

taken
its
toll
of

in
addition
to
all
this
human

we
have
the
loss
of

in
the
supposed
interest
of

needs
with
but
few
exceptions
the
states
have
strengthened
their
labor
laws
in
its
summary
the
american
association
for
labor
legislation
says
eleven
states
strengthened
their
child
labor
laws
by
raising
age
limits
extending
restrictions
to
new
employments
or
shortening

texas
passed
a

the
changes
being

by
a
tendency
to
extend

and
increase

the

quickened
the
public
sense
of
responsibility
that
fact
opens
the
widest
field
to
women
for
work
in
which
they
are
best
prepared
by
nature
and
training
many
keen
thinkers
are
concerned
over
the
question
of
population
one
of
our
most
distinguished
professors
has
thrown
out
a
hint
of
a
possibility
that
considering
the
greater
proportion
of
women
to
men
some
form
of
plurality
of
wives
may
become
necessary
the
disturbed
balance
of
the
sexes
is
a
thing
that
will
right
itself
in
one
generation
need
of
population
will
be
best
answered
by
efforts
to
salvage
the
race
the
united
states
loses
each
year
five
hundred
thousand
babies
under
twelve
months
of
age
from
preventable
causes
an
effort
to
save
them
would
seem
more
reasonable
than
a
demand
for
more
children
to
neglect
life
will
be
so
full
of
drive
and
interest
that
the
woman
who
has
given
no
hostages
to
fortune
will
find
ample
scope
for
her
powers
outside
of
motherhood
the
old
maid
of
tomorrow
will
have
a
mission
more
honored
and
important
than
was
hers
in
the
past
but
whatever
the
conclusions
as
to
the
wisest
method
of
building
up
population
there
is
no
doubt
that
government
and
individuals
will
make
strict
valuation
of
the
essentials
and
in
national
life
in
our
poverty
we
will
test
all
things
in
the
light
of
their
benefit
to
the
race
and
hold
fast
that
which
is
good
the
opinions
of
women
will
weigh
in
this
national
accounting
there
will
be
no
money
to
squander
and
women
to
a
unit
will
stand
behind
those
men
who
think
a
recreation
field
is
of
more
value
than
a
race
track
it
will
be
the
woman
view
there
being
but
one
choice
that
it
is
better
to
encourage
fleetness
and
skill
in
boys
and
girls
than
in
horses
if
we
have
just
so
much
money
to
spend
and
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
there
shall
be
corner
saloons
or
municipal
kitchens
public
sentiment
made
in
good
measure
by
women
will
eschew
the
saloon
the
things
that
lend
themselves
to
the
husbanding
of
the
race
will
draw
as
a
magnet
those
who
have
borne
the
race
the
tired
world
will
need
for
its
rejuvenation
a
broadened
and
deepened
medical
science
women
are
too
wise
to
permit
sanitation
and
research
to
fall
to
a
low
level
on
the
contrary
they
will
wish
them
to
be
more
thorough
there
will
be
economy
along
the
less
essential
lines
to
meet
the
cost
the
flagging
spirit
needs
the
inspiration
of
art
and
music
to
secure
them
in
the
future
state
and
municipal
effort
will
be
demanded
women
are
born
economizers
they
have
been
trained
to
pinch
each
penny
with
their
advent
into
political
life
roads
and
public
buildings
will
cost
less
through
careful
saving
funds
will
be
made
available
for
the
things
of
the
spirit
one
of
the
men
conductors
on
the
new
york
street
railways
somewhat
reproachfully
remarked
to
me
no
one
ever
came
to
look
at
the
recreation
room
and
restaurant
at
the
car
barns
until
women
were
taken
on
men
do
seem
to
count
is
the
reproach
deserved
have
women
been
narrow
in
sympathy
perhaps
we
have
assumed
that
men
can
look
out
for
themselves
they
could
but
in
private
life
they
never
do
women
have
to
do
the
mothering
a
is
ready
enough
to
regulate
wages
and
hours
but
he
gives
not
a
thought
to
surroundings
in
factory
and
workshop
an
act
of
protection
generally
starts
with
solicitude
about
a
woman
or
child
factory
legislation
took
root
in
their
needs
there
was
no
mercy
for
the
man
worker
his
only
chance
of
getting
better
conditions
was
when
women
entered
his
occupation
and
the
regulation
meant
for
her
benefit
indirectly
served
his
interest
men
suffer
more
than
women
in
certain
dangerous
trades
but
i
did
not
suppose
you
were
generous
enough
to
care
anything
about
them
came
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
at
a
labor
conference
at
the
end
of
a
most
admirable
paper
on
women
in
dangerous
trades
given
by
one
of
the
doctors
in
the
new
york
city
department
of
health
he
was
speaking
to
an
audience
of
working
women
i
doubt
if
his
hearers
had
given
a
thought
to
men
workers
perhaps
this
is
natural
since
there
has
been
going
on
at
the
same
time
with
the
development
of
factory
legislation
in
america
a
strong
propaganda
directed
especially
at
political
freedom
for
women
we
have
been
laying
stress
on
the
wrongs
of
woman
and
demanding
very
persistently
and
convincingly
her
rights
the
industrial
needs
and
rights
of
the
man
have
been
overlooked
with
increasing
numbers
of
women
entering
the
industrial
world
with
ever
widening
extension
of
the
vote
to
women
and
the
consequent
quickening
of
public
responsibility
together
with
the
recent
experience
of
europe
demonstrating
the
importance
of
care
for
all
workers
both
men
and
women
there
is
ground
for
hope
that
even
the
united
states
where
protective
legislation
is
so
retarded
in
development
will
enter
upon
wide
and
fundamental
plans
for
conservation
of
all
our
human
resources
protection
of
the
worker
housing
conditions
the
feeding
of
factory
employees
and
school
children
play
grounds
and
recreation
centers
will
challenge
the
world
for
first
consideration
these
are
the
social
processes
which
command
most
surely
the
hearts
and
minds
of
women
the
churning
which
the
war
has
given
humanity
has
roused
in
women
a
realization
that
upon
them
rests
at
least
half
the
burden
of
saving
civilization
from
wreck
here
is
the
world
with
such
and
such
needs
for
food
clothing
shelter
with
such
and
such
needs
for
sanitation
hospitals
and
above
all
for
education
for
science
for
the
arts
if
it
is
not
to
fall
back
into
the
conditions
of
the
middle
ages
how
can
women
aid
in
making
secure
the
national
position
certainly
not
by
idleness
inefficiency
an
easy
policy
of
laissez
faire
they
must
labor
economize
and
pool
their
brains
women
can
save
civilization
only
by
the
broadest
coöperative
action
by
daring
to
think
by
daring
to
be
themselves
the
world
is
entering
an
heroic
age
calling
for
heroic
women
