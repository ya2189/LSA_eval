thoreau
preface
since
the
publication
six
years
ago
of
how
to
know
the
wild
flowers
i
have
received
such
convincing
testimony
of
the
eagerness
of
of
all
ages
and
conditions
to
familiarize
themselves
with
the
inhabitants
of
our
woods
and
fields
and
so
many
assurances
of
the
joy
which
such
a
familiarity
affords
that
i
have
prepared
this
companion
volume
on
how
to
know
the
ferns
it
has
been
my
experience
that
the
world
of
delight
which
opens
before
us
when
we
are
admitted
into
some
sort
of
intimacy
with
our
companions
other
than
human
is
enlarged
with
each
new
society
into
which
we
win
our
way
it
seems
strange
that
the
abundance
of
ferns
everywhere
has
not
aroused
more
curiosity
as
to
their
names
haunts
and
habits
add
to
this
abundance
the
incentive
to
their
study
afforded
by
the
fact
that
owing
to
the
comparatively
small
number
of
species
we
can
familiarize
ourselves
with
a
large
proportion
of
our
native
ferns
during
a
single
summer
and
it
is
still
more
surprising
that
so
few
efforts
have
been
made
to
bring
them
within
easy
reach
of
the
public
i
wish
to
acknowledge
my
indebtedness
to
the
many
books
on
our
native
ferns
which
i
have
consulted

more
especially

fern
ferns
as
a
hobby
i
think
it
is
charles
lamb
who
says
that
every
man
should
have
a
hobby
if
it
be
nothing
better
than
collecting
strings
a
man
with
a
hobby
turns
to
account
the
spare
moments
a
holiday
is
a
delight
instead
of
a
bore
to
a
man
with
a
hobby
thrown
out
of
his
usual
occupations
on
a
holiday
the
average
man
is
at
a
loss
for
employment
provided
his
neighbors
are
in
the
same
fix
he
can
play
cards
but
there
are
hobbies
and
hobbies
as
an
occasional
relaxation
for
example
nothing
can
be
said
against
but
as
a
hobby
it
is
not
much
better
than
collecting
strings
it
is
neither
broadening
mentally
nor
invigorating
physically
and
it
closes
the
door
upon
other
interests
which
are
both
i
remember
that
once
on
a
long
i
envied
certain
of
my
who
found
amusement
in
cards
when
the
conditions
were
such
as
to
make
almost
any
other
occupation
out
of
the
question
but
when
finally
the
course
lay
along
a
strange
coast
winding
among
unfamiliar
islands
by
shores
luxuriant
with
tropical
vegetation
and
sprinkled
with
strange
settlements
all
affording
delight
to
the
eye
and
interest
to
the
mind
these
players
who
had
come
abroad
solely
for
instruction
and
pleasure
could
not
be
enticed
from
their
tables
and
i
thanked
my
stars
that
i
had
not
fallen
under
the
stultifying
sway
of
cards
much
the
same
gratitude
is
aroused
when
i
see
men
and
women
spending
precious
summer
days
indoors
over
the
when
they
might
be
breathing
the
fragrant
air
and
rejoicing
in
the
beauty
and
interest
of
the
woods
and
fields
all
things
considered
a
hobby
that
takes
us
out
of
doors
is
the
best
the
different
sports
may
be
classed
under
this
head
the
chief
lack
in
the
artificial
sports
such
as
polo
golf
baseball
as
opposed
to
the
natural
sports
hunting
and
fishing
is
that
while
they
are
invaluable
as
a
means
of
health
and
relaxation
they
do
not
lead
to
other
and
broader
interests
while
many
a
has
developed
into
a
naturalist
as
a
result
of
long
days
in
the
woods
hunting
and
fishing
would
seem
almost
perfect
recreations
were
it
not
for
the
element
which
may
become
brutalizing
i
wish
that
every
mother
who
believes
in
the
value
of
natural
sport
for
her
young
boys
would
set
her
face
sternly
against
any
taking
of
life
that
can
not
be
justified
on
the
ground
of
man
needs
either
in
the
way
of
protection
or
support
the
ideal
hobby
it
seems
to
me
is
one
that
keeps
us
in
the
open
air
among
inspiring
surroundings
with
the
knowledge
of
natural
objects
as
the
end
in
view
the
study
of
plants
of
animals
of
the
earth
itself
botany
zoölogy
or
geology
any
one
of
these
will
answer
the
varied
requirements
of
an
ideal
hobby
potentially
they
possess
all
the
elements
of
sport
often
they
require
not
only
perseverance
and
skill
but
courage
and
daring
they
are
a
means
of
health
a
relaxation
to
the
mind
from
ordinary
cares
and
an
absorbing
interest
any
one
of
them
may
be
used
as
a
doorway
to
the
others
if
parents
realized
the
value
to
their
childrens
minds
and
bodies
of
a
love
for
plants
and
animals
of
any
such
hobby
as
birds
or
butterflies
or
trees
or
flowers
i
am
sure
they
would
take
more
pains
to
encourage
the
interest
which
instinctively
a
child
feels
in
these
things
it
must
be
because
such
realization
is
lacking
that
we
see
parents
apparently
either
too
indolent
or
too
ignorant
to
share
the
enthusiasm
and
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
awakened
in
the
child
active
mind
by
natural
objects
of
course
it
is
possible
that
owing
to
the
strange
reticence
of
many
children
parents
may
be
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
any
enthusiasm
or
curiosity
of
this
sort
as
a
little
child
i
was
so
eager
to
know
the
names
of
the
wild
flowers
that
i
went
through
my
grandfather
library
examining
book
after
book
on
flowers
in
the
vain
hope
of
acquiring
the
desired
information
always
after
more
or
less
tedious
reading
for
i
was
too
young
to
master
tables
of
contents
and
introductions
i
would
discover
that
the
volume
under
examination
was
devoted
to
garden
flowers
but
i
do
not
remember
that
it
occurred
to
me
to
tell
anyone
what
i
wanted
or
to
ask
for
help
finally
i
learned
that
a
book
on
the
subject
written
for
young
people
was
in
existence
and
i
asked
my
mother
to
buy
it
for
me
the
request
was
gratified
promptly
and
i
plodded
through
the
preliminary
matter
of
how
plants
grow
to
find
that
i
was
quite
unable
to
master
the
key
and
that
any
knowledge
of
the
flowers
that
could
appeal
to
my
was
locked
away
from
me
as
hopelessly
as
before
even
though
my
one
expressed
wish
had
been
so
gladly
met
i
did
not
confide
to
others
my
perplexity
but
surrendered
sadly
a
cherished
dream
owing
largely
i
believe
to
the
reaction
from
this
disappointment
it
was
many
years
before
i
attempted
again
to
wrestle
with
a
botanical
key
or
to
learn
the
names
of
the
flowers
how
much
was
lost
by
yielding
too
easily
to
discouragement
i
not
only
realize
now
but
i
realized
it
partially
during
the
long
period
when
the
plants
were
nameless
among
the
flowers
whose
faces
were
familiar
though
their
names
were
unknown
i
felt
that
i
was
not
making
the
most
of
my
opportunities
and
when
i
met
plants
which
were
both
new
and
nameless
i
was
a
stranger
indeed
in
the
english
woods
and
along
the
lovely
english
rivers
by
the
rushing
torrents
and
in
the
alpine
meadows
of
switzerland
on
the
mountains
of
brazil
i
should
have
felt
myself
less
an
alien
had
i
been
able
then
as
now
to
detect
the
kinship
between
foreign
and
north
american
plants
and
to
call
the
strangers
by
names
that
were
at
least
partially
familiar
to
the
man
or
woman
who
is
somewhat
at
home
in
the
travel
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
what
it
is
to
one
who
does
not
know
a
mint
from
a
mustard
the
shortest
journey
to
a
new
locality
is
full
of
interest
to
the
traveller
who
is
striving
to
lengthen
his
list
of
plant
acquaintances
the
tedious
waits
around
the
railway
station
are
welcomed
as
opportunities
for
fresh
discoveries
the
slow
local
train
receives
blessings
instead
of
anathemas
because
of
the
superiority
of
its
windows
as
posts
of
observation
the
long
stage
ride
is
too
short
to
satisfy
the
who
is
keeping
count
of
the
different
species
by
the
roadside
while
crossing
the
continent
on
the
canadian
pacific
railway
a
few
years
ago
the
days
spent
in
traversing
the
vast
plains
east
of
the
rockies
were
days
of
keen
enjoyment
on
account
of
the
new
plants
seen
from
my
window
and
gathered
breathlessly
for
identification
during
the
brief
stops
but
to
most
of
my
they
were
days
of
unmitigated
boredom
they
could
not
comprehend
the
reluctance
with
which
i
met
each
nightfall
as
an
interruption
to
my
watch
when
finally
one
cold
june
morning
we
climbed
the
glorious
canadian
rockies
and
were
driven
to
the
hotel
at
banff
where
we
were
to
rest
for
hours
the
enjoyment
of
the
previous
week
was
crowned
by
seeing
the
tables
decorated
with
a
flower
which
i
had
never
succeeded
in
finding
in
the
woods
at
home
it
was
the
lovely
little
orchid
a
shy
wild
creature
which
had
been
brought
to
me
from
the
mountains
of
vermont
it
seemed
almost
desecration
to
force
this
little
aristocrat
to
consort
with
the
and
pickles
of
a
hotel
in
my
eagerness
to
see
calypso
in
her
i
could
scarcely
wait
to
eat
the
breakfast
for
which
a
few
moments
before
i
had
been
painfully
hungry
unfortunately
the
waiters
at
banff
were
proved
as
ruthless
as
vandals
in
other
parts
of
the
world
among
the
pines
that
clothed
the
lower
i
found
many
plants
of
calypso
but
only
one
or
two
of
the
delicate
blossoms
had
been
left
to
gladden
the
eyes
of
those
who
love
to
see
a
flower
in
the
wild
beauty
of
its
natural
surroundings
that
same
eventful
day
had
in
store
for
me
another
delight
as
the
result
of
my
love
for
plants
for
a
long
time
i
had
wished
to
know
the
a
flower
with
whose
general
appearance
from
pictures
or
from
descriptions
i
was
familiar
i
knew
that
it
grew
in
this
part
of
the
world
but
during
a
careful
search
of
the
woods
and
meadows
and
of
the
banks
of
the
rushing
streams
the
only
i
discovered
was
a
faded
blossom
which
someone
had
picked
and
flung
upon
the
late
in
the
afternoon
having
given
up
the
hope
of
any
fresh
find
i
went
for
a
swim
in
the
warm
sulphur
pool
while
paddling
about
the
clear
water
revelling
in
the
beauty
of
the
surroundings
and
the
sheer
physical
joy
of
the
moment
my
eyes
fell
suddenly
on
a
cluster
of
pink
blossoms
springing
from
the
opposite
rocks
i
recognized
at
once
the
pretty
two
days
later
at
glacier
i
had
another
pleasure
from
the
same
source
in
the
discovery
of
great
beds
of
nodding
golden
lilies
the
western
species
of
adder
tongue
growing
close
to
white
fields
of
snow
ten
thousand
saw
i
at
a
glance
tossing
their
heads
in
sprightly
dance
the
enjoyment
of
the
entire
trip
to
the
pacific
coast
of
the
voyage
among
the
islands
and
glaciers
of
alaska
and
of
the
journey
home
through
the
yellowstone
and
across
our
western
prairies
was
increased
indescribably
by
the
new
plants
i
learned
to
know
the
pleasure
we
take
in
literature
as
in
travel
is
enhanced
by
a
knowledge
of
nature
not
only
are
we
able
better
to
appreciate
writers
on
nature
so
original
and
inspiring
as
thoreau
or
so
charming
as
john
burroughs
but
such
poets
as
wordsworth
lowell
bryant
and
countless
others
mean
infinitely
more
to
the
man
or
woman
who
with
a
love
of
poetry
combines
a
knowledge
of
the
plants
and
birds
mentioned
in
the
poems
books
of
travel
are
usually
far
more
interesting
if
we
have
some
knowledge
of
botany
and
zoölogy
this
is
also
true
of
biographies
which
deal
with
men
or
women
who
find
either
their
work
or
their
recreation
and
how
many
men
and
women
who
have
been
powers
for
good
may
be
counted
in
one
class
or
the
other
in
some
department
of
natural
science
one
fascinating
department
of
that
of
ferns
has
received
but
little
attention
in
this
country
within
the
last
few
years
we
have
been
supplied
with
excellent
and
inexpensive
to
our
birds
butterflies
trees
and
flowers
but
so
far
as
i
know
with
the
exception
of
williamson
little
volume
on
the
ferns
of
kentucky
we
have
no
book
with
sufficient
text
and
illustrations
within
the
reach
of
the
brains
and
purse
of
the
average
in
england
one
finds
books
of
all
sizes
and
prices
on
the
english
ferns
while
our
beautiful
american
ferns
are
almost
unknown
owing
probably
to
the
lack
of
attractive
and
inexpensive
fern
literature
finely
illustrated
work
on
the
ferns
of
north
america
is
entirely
out
of
the
question
on
account
of
its
expense
and
the
illustrated
flora
of
britton
brown
is
also
beyond
the
reach
of
the
ordinary
miss
price
fern
collectors
is
helpful
but
it
is
without
descriptive
text
our
native
ferns
and
their
allies
by
underwood
is
exhaustive
and
authoritative
but
it
is
extremely
technical
and
the
different
species
are
not
illustrated
mr
pamphlet
on
the
ferns
and
fern
allies
of
new
england
is
excellent
so
far
as
it
goes
the
descriptions
not
being
so
technical
as
to
confuse
the
beginner
but
this
also
is
not
illustrated
while
pamphlet
the
ferns
and
evergreens
of
new
england
has
clear
illustrations
of
many
species
but
it
has
no
text
of
importance
in
view
of
the
singular
grace
and
charm
of
the
fern
tribe
patent
to
the
most
careless
observer
this
lack
of
fern
literature
is
surprising
it
is
possible
that
thoreau
is
right
in
claiming
that
we
all
feel
the
ferns
to
be
farther
from
us
essentially
and
sympathetically
than
the
phenogamous
plants
the
roses
and
weeds
for
instance
this
may
be
true
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
to
some
of
us
the
charm
of
ferns
is
as
great
their
beauty
more
subtle
than
that
of
the
flowering
plants
and
to
learn
to
know
them
by
name
to
trace
them
to
their
homes
and
to
observe
their
habits
is
attended
with
an
interest
as
keen
perhaps
keener
than
that
which
attends
the
study
of
the
names
haunts
and
habits
of
the
flowers
that
ferns
possess
a
peculiar
power
of
blinding
their
votaries
to
the
actual
position
they
occupy
in
the
minds
of
people
in
general
seems
to
me
evidenced
by
the
following
quotations
taken
respectively
from
underwood
and
williamson
introductions
so
competent
and
coldly
scientific
an
authority
as
underwood
opens
his
book
with
these
words
in
the
entire
vegetable
world
there
are
probably
no
forms
of
growth
that
attract
more
general
notice
than
the
ferns
the
lack
of
fern
literature
it
seems
to
me
proves
the
fallacy
of
this
statement
if
ferns
had
been
more
generally
noticed
than
other
forms
of
growth
in
the
vegetable
world
surely
more
would
have
been
written
on
the
subject
and
occasionally
someone
besides
a
botanist
would
be
found
who
could
name
correctly
more
than
three
or
four
of
our
common
wayside
ferns
in
his
introduction
to
the
ferns
of
kentucky
williamson
asks
who
would
now
think
of
going
to
the
country
to
spend
a
few
days
or
even
one
day
without
first
inquiring
whether
ferns
are
to
be
found
in
the
locality
though
for
some
years
i
have
been
interested
in
ferns
and
have
made
many
country
expeditions
with
various
friends
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
heard
this
question
asked
yet
that
two
such
writers
as
underwood
and
williamson
could
imagine
the
existence
of
a
state
of
things
so
contrary
to
fact
goes
far
to
prove
the
fascination
of
the
study
to
the
practical
mind
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
ferns
as
a
hobby
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
number
of
our
native
that
is
of
our
northeastern
ferns
is
so
comparatively
small
as
to
make
it
an
easy
matter
to
learn
to
know
by
name
and
to
see
in
their
homes
perhaps
of
them
on
an
ordinary
walk
of
an
hour
or
two
through
the
fields
and
woods
the
fern
student
can
familiarize
himself
with
anywhere
from
ten
to
fifteen
of
the
ferns
described
in
this
book
during
a
summer
holiday
in
an
average
locality
he
should
learn
to
know
by
sight
and
by
name
from
to
thirty
ferns
while
in
a
really
good
neighborhood
the
enthusiast
who
is
willing
to
scour
the
surrounding
country
from
the
tops
of
the
highest
mountains
to
the
depths
of
the
wildest
ravines
may
hope
to
extend
his
list
into
the
forties
during
the
past
year
several
lists
of
the
ferns
found
on
a
single
walk
or
within
a
certain
radius
have
been
published
in
the
leading
to
some
rivalry
between
fern
students
who
claim
precedence
for
their
pet
localities
underwood
has
found
species
within
the
immediate
vicinity
of
green
lake
onondaga
county
and
species
within
a
circle
whose
diameter
is
not
over
three
miles
terry
on
a
walk
near
dorset
did
still
better
she
found
species
and
four
varieties
while
miss
margaret
slosson
has
broken
the
record
by
finding
species
and
eight
varieties
near
pittsford
rutland
county
within
a
triangle
formed
by
the
end
of
a
tamarack
swamp
a
field
less
than
a
mile
away
and
some
limestone
cliffs
three
miles
from
both
the
field
and
the
end
of
the
swamp
apart
from
the
interest
of
extending
one
list
of
fern
acquaintances
is
that
of
discovering
new
stations
for
the
rarer
species
it
was
my
good
fortune
last
summer
to
make
one
of
a
party
which
found
a
previously
unknown
station
for
the
rare
hart
tongue
and
i
felt
the
thrill
of
excitement
which
attends
such
an
experience
the
other
day
in
looking
over
torrey
flora
of
new
york
i
noticed
the
absence
of
several
ferns
now
known
to
be
natives
of
this
state
when
the
fern
student
realizes
the
possibility
which
is
always
before
him
of
finding
a
new
station
for
a
rare
fern
and
thus
adding
an
item
of
value
to
the
natural
history
of
the
state
he
should
be
stimulated
to
fresh
zeal
other
interesting
possibilities
are
those
of
discovering
a
new
variety
and
of
chancing
upon
those
forked
or
crested
fronds
which
appear
occasionally
in
many
species
these
unusual
forms
not
only
possess
the
charm
of
rarity
and
sometimes
of
intrinsic
beauty
but
they
are
interesting
because
of
the
light
it
is
believed
they
may
throw
on
problems
of
fern
ancestry
to
this
department
of
fern
study
the
discovery
and
development
of
abnormal
forms
much
attention
is
paid
in
england
in
lowe
british
ferns
i
find
described
between
thirty
and
forty
varieties
of
while
the
varieties
of
our
rare
hart
tongue
extend
into
the
hundreds
the
majority
of
ferns
mature
late
in
the
summer
giving
the
student
the
advantage
of
several
weeks
or
months
in
which
to
observe
their
growth
many
of
our
most
interesting
flowers
bloom
and
perish
before
we
realize
that
the
spring
is
really
over
there
are
few
flower
lovers
who
have
not
had
the
sense
of
being
outwitted
by
the
rush
of
the
season
every
year
i
make
appointments
with
the
different
plants
to
visit
them
at
their
flowering
time
and
nearly
every
year
i
miss
some
such
appointments
through
failure
to
appreciate
the
short
lives
of
these
fragile
blossoms
a
few
of
the
ferns
share
the
early
habits
common
to
so
many
flowers
but
usually
we
can
hope
to
find
them
in
their
prime
when
most
of
the
flowers
have
disappeared
illustration
the
greatest
charm
the
ferns
possess
is
that
of
their
surroundings
to
me
the
greatest
charm
the
ferns
possess
is
that
of
their
surroundings
no
other
plants
know
so
well
how
to
choose
their
haunts
if
you
wish
to
know
the
ferns
you
must
follow
them
to
nature
most
sacred
retreats
in
remote
tangled
swamps
overhanging
the
swift
noiseless
brook
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
close
to
the
rush
of
the
foaming
waterfall
in
the
depths
of
some
dark
ravine
or
perhaps
high
up
on
where
the
air
is
purer
and
the
world
wider
and
life
more
beautiful
than
we
had
fancied
these
wild
graceful
things
are
most
at
home
you
will
never
learn
to
know
the
ferns
if
you
expect
to
make
their
acquaintance
from
a
carriage
along
the
highway
or
in
the
interval
between
two
meals
for
their
sakes
you
must
renounce
indolent
habits
you
must
be
willing
to
tramp
tirelessly
through
woods
and
across
fields
to
climb
mountains
and
to
scramble
down
gorges
you
must
be
content
with
what
luncheon
you
can
carry
in
your
pocket
and
let
me
tell
you
this
when
at
last
you
fling
yourself
upon
some
bed
of
springing
moss
and
add
to
your
sandwich
cresses
fresh
and
dripping
from
the
neighboring
brook
you
will
eat
your
simple
meal
with
a
relish
that
never
attends
the
most
elaborate
luncheon
within
four
walls
and
when
later
you
surrender
yourself
to
the
delicious
sense
of
fatigue
and
drowsy
relaxation
which
steals
over
you
mind
and
body
listening
to
the
plaintive
notes
of
the
and
the
sharp
tsing
of
the
locusts
breathing
the
mingled
fragrance
of
the
mint
at
your
feet
and
the
pines
and
hemlocks
overhead
you
will
wonder
vaguely
why
on
summer
days
you
ever
drive
along
the
dusty
or
eat
indoors
or
do
any
of
the
flavorless
conventional
things
that
consume
so
large
a
portion
of
our
lives
of
course
what
is
true
of
other
studies
is
true
of
the
study
of
ferns
constantly
your
curiosity
is
aroused
by
some
some
tree
some
gorgeously
colored
butterfly
and
in
the
case
of
ferns
especially
by
some
outcropping
rock
which
make
you
eager
to
follow
up
other
branches
of
and
to
know
by
name
each
tree
and
bird
and
butterfly
and
rock
you
meet
the
immediate
result
of
these
long
happy
days
is
that
golden
doze
of
mind
which
follows
upon
much
exercise
in
the
open
air
the
ecstatic
stupor
which
stevenson
supposes
to
be
the
nearly
chronic
condition
of
laborers
surely
there
is
no
such
preventive
of
insomnia
no
such
cure
for
nervousness
or
morbid
introspection
as
an
absorbing
interest
body
and
mind
alike
are
invigorated
to
a
degree
that
can
not
be
appreciated
by
one
who
has
not
experienced
the
power
of
some
such
close
and
loving
contact
with
nature
when
and
where
to
find
ferns
it
is
no
use
to
direct
our
steps
to
the
woods
if
they
do
not
carry
us
thither
i
am
alarmed
when
it
happens
that
i
have
walked
a
mile
into
the
woods
bodily
without
getting
there
in
spirit
when
and
where
to
find
ferns
it
is
in
early
spring
that
one
likes
to
take
up
for
the
first
time
an
study
but
if
you
begin
your
search
for
ferns
in
march
when
the
woods
are
yielding
a
few
timid
blossoms
and
the
air
still
pungent
with
a
suggestion
of
winter
vibrates
to
the
lisping
notes
of
newly
arrived
birds
you
will
hardly
be
rewarded
by
finding
any
but
the
evergreen
species
and
even
these
are
not
likely
to
be
especially
conspicuous
at
this
season
usually
it
is
the
latter
part
of
april
before
the
pioneers
among
the
ferns

great
osmundas
push
up
the
big
woolly
croziers

will
soon
develop
into
the

whitish
scales

appear
fresh
batches
of
young
ferns
someone
has
said
that
there
is
nothing
more
aggressively
than
a
young
fern

this
thought
will
recur
constantly
as
you
chance
upon
the
little
wrinkled
fronds
whether
they
are
bundled
up
in
wrappings
of
soft
wool
or
protected
by
a
garment
of
overlapping
scales

whether
like
many
of
the

arrivals
they
come
into
the

naked

of
this

the
first
fronds
of
this
little
plant
are
very
small
and
simple
quite
unlike
the
later
ones
for
a
time
the
plant
is
nourished
by
the
prothallium
but
as
soon
as
it
is
sufficiently
developed
and
vigorous
enough
to
shift
for
itself
the
prothallium
dies
away
and
the
fern
maintains
an
independent
existence
eventually
it
produces
fronds
which
bear
on
their
lower
surfaces
the
sporangia
containing
the
minute
spores
from
which
spring
the
prothallia
for
our
present
purpose
it
is
enough
to
say
that
spores
differ
from
seeds
in
that
they
are
not
the
immediate
result
of
the
interaction
of
reproductive
organs
they
resemble
seeds
in
that
they
are
expelled
from
the
on
attaining
maturity
and
germinate
on
contact
with
the
moist
earth
thus
it
is
seen
that
the
of
a
fern
consists
of
two
stages
first
the
prothallium
bearing
the
reproductive
organs
second
the
proper
developing
the
spores
which
produce
the
prothallium
along
the
moist
shaded
banks
of
the
wood
road
or
on
decaying
stumps
keen
eyes
will
discern
frequently
the
tiny
green
prothallia
although
they
are
somewhat
difficult
to
find
except
in
the
where
one
can
see
them
in
abundance
either
in
the
boxes
used
for
growing
the
young
plants
or
on
the
moist
surfaces
of
where
the
spores
have
fallen
accidentally
and
have
germinated
as
the
fertilization
of
the
in
the
archegonium
can
not
take
place
except
under
water
perhaps
the
fact
is
accounted
for
that
ferns
are
found
chiefly
in
moist
places
this
water
may
be
only
a
sufficient
amount
of
rain
or
dew
to
permit
the
antherozoids
or
fertilizing
cells
of
the
antheridium
to
swim
to
the

they
enter

the

they
do
not

like
all
the
osmundas
and
indeed
like
most
growing
things
it

of
the
group
of
osmundas

flowering

as
they
are
sometimes
called
not
of
course
because
they
really
flower
but
because
their
fruiting
fronds
are
somewhat
in
appearance
there
are
three
species
of
the
cinnamon
fern
the
royal
fern
and
the

all
three
are
beautiful
and
striking
plants
producing
their

in

and

by

of

the

themselves

little

the
the
following
passage
from
an
article
by
saunders
on
at
home
pusilla
was
first
collected
early
in
this
century
at
quaker
bridge
about
miles
east
of
philadelphia
the
spot
is
a
place
in
the
wildest
of
the
barrens
where
a
branch
of
the
atsion
river
flows
through
marshy
lowlands
and
cedar
swamps
here
amid
mosses
lycopodiums
droseras
and
wild
cranberry
vines
the
little
treasure
has
been
collected
but
though
i
have
hunted
for
it
more
than
once
my
eyes
have
never
been
sharp
enough
to
detect
its
fronds
in
that
locality
in
october
of
last
year
however
a
friend
guided
me
to
another
place
in
new
jersey
where
he
knew
it
to
be
growing
and
there
we
found
it
it
was
a
small
open
spot
in
the
pine
barrens
low
and
damp
in
the
white
sand
grew
patches
of
low
grasses
mosses
lycopodium
carolinianum
inundatum
and
pyxidanthera
barbulata
besides
several
smaller
ericaceous
plants
and
some
larger
shrubs
such
as
sumacs
etc
close
by
was
a
little
stream
and
just
beyond
that
a
bog
although
we
knew
that
the
schizæa
grew
within
a
few
feet
of
the
path
in
which
we
stood
it
required
the
closest
sort
of
a
search
with
eyes
at
the
level
of
our
knees
before
a
specimen
was
detected
the
sterile
fronds
curled
like
corkscrews
grew
in
little
tufts
and
were
more
readily
visible
than
the
fertile
spikes
which
were
less
numerous
and
together
with
the
slender
stipes
were
of
a
brown
color
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
capsules
of
the
mosses
and
the
maturing
stems
of
the
grasses
which
grew
all
about
lying
flat
on
the
earth
with
face
within
a
few
inches
of
the
ground
was
found
the
most
satisfactory
plan
of
search
down
there
all
the
individual
plants
looked
bigger
and
a
sidelong
glance
brought
the
fertile
clusters
more
prominently
into
view
when
the
sight
got
accustomed
to
the
miniature
jungle
quite
a
number
of
specimens
were
found
but
the
fern
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
plentiful
and
all
that
we
gathered
were
within
a
radius
of
a
couple
of
yards
this
seems
indeed
to
be
one
of
those
plants
whose
whereabouts
is
oftenest
revealed
by
what
we
are
wont
to
term
a
accident
as
for
instance
when
we
are
lying
stretched
on
the
ground
resting
or
as
we
stoop
at
lunch
to
crack
an
egg
on
the
toe
of
our
shoe
i
know
of
one
excellent
collector
who
spent
a
whole
day
looking
for
it
diligently
in
what
he
thought
to
be
a
likely
spot
but
without
success
when
finally
just
before
the
time
for
return
came
as
he
was
half
crouching
on
the
ground
scarcely
thinking
now
of
schizæa
its
fronds
suddenly
flashed
upon
his
sight
right
at
his
feet
the
sterile
fronds
of
schizæa
pusilla
are
evergreen
so
that
the
collector
may
perhaps
most
readily
detect
it
in
winter
selecting
days
for
his
search
when
the
earth
is
pretty
clear
of
snow
the
surrounding
vegetation
being
at
that
time
dead

in

the

misleads
those
who
are
so
unfamiliar
with
the
habits
of

as
to
imagine
that
they
ever
flower
that
it
really
is
descriptive
was
proved
to
me
only
a
few
weeks
ago
when
i

a

by
the
request
to
inform
the

as
to
the
name
of
the

inclosed
which
seemed
to
him
to
belong
to
the

the
origin
of
the

seems
somewhat
obscure
it
is
said
to
be
derived
from
osmunder
the
saxon
thor
in
his
herbal
gerarde
tells
us
that
was
formerly
called
osmund
the
waterman
in
allusion
perhaps
to
its
liking
for
a
home
in
the

one
legend
claims
that
a
certain
osmund
living
at

saved
his
wife

child
from
the
inimical

by
hiding
them
upon
an

of

that
in

the
child
so
shielded
named
the

father
the
following
lines
from

point
to
still
another
origin
of
the
generic
name
often
trifling
with
a
privilege
alike
indulged
to
all
we
paused
one
now

now
the

point
out
perchance
to

some

right
to

with

a
few

later

in

i
found
several
within

fact
that
a
thing
once
seen
is
easily
discovered
again

the
of

on

i
noticed
a
field
that
appeared
to
be

showed
an

although
the

grows
i
believe
within
fifteen
miles
of
my
home
in
albany
i
never
saw
the
plant
until
this
summer
some
hundred
miles
nearer
the
centre
of
the
state
during
a
morning
call
i
chanced
to
mention
that
i
was
anxious
to
find
two
or
three
ferns
which
were
said
to
grow
in
the
neighborhood
my
hostess
told
me
that
years
before
on
some
limestone
cliffs
about
eight
miles
away
she
had
found
two
unknown
ferns
which
had
been
classified
and
labelled
by
a
botanical
friend
excusing
herself
she
left
me
and
soon
returned
with
carefully
pressed
specimens
of
the
purple
cliff
brake
and
the
little
rue
spleenwort
the
two
ferns
i
was
most
eager
to
find
such
moments
as
i
experienced
then
of
but
peculiar
satisfaction
go
far
toward
making
one
an
apostle
of
hobbies
my
pleasure
was
increased
by
the
kind
offer
to
guide
me
to
the
spot
which
had
yielded
the
specimens
one
morning
soon
after
we
were
set
down
at
the
little
railway
station
from
which
we
purposed
to
walk
to
the
cliffs
we
were
not
without
misgivings
as
we
followed
an
indefinite
path
across
some
limestone
quarries
for
a
plant
may
easily
disappear
from
a
given
station
in
the
course
of
years
in
a
few
moments
the
path
disappeared
in
a
fringe
of
bushes
which
evidently
marked
the
beginning
of
a
precipitous
descent
cautiously
clinging
to
whatever
we
could
lay
hold
of
bushes
roots
of
trees
or
imbedded
rocks
we
climbed
over
the
cliff
side
still
following
the
semblance
of
a
path
on
our
left
a
stream
plunged
nearly
two
hundred
feet
into
the
ravine
below
for
some
distance
the
eye
could
follow
its
silver
course
then
it
disappeared
beneath
the
arching
trees
on
our
right
many
miles
beyond
through
the
blue
haze
which
hung
over
the
distant
valley
we
could
see
the
lake
to
which
the
stream
was
hurrying
we
could
not
surrender
ourselves
with
comfort
to
the
beauty
of
the
outlook
as
our
surroundings
were
not
such
as
to
put
us
altogether
at
ease
overhead
hung
great
rocks
so
cracked
and
seamed
and
shattered
as
to
threaten
a
complete
downfall
while
beneath
our
feet
the
path
which
led
along
the
face
of
the
cliff
crumbled
away
so
that
it
was
difficult
in
places
to
obtain
any
foothold
having
passed
the
more
perilous
spots
however
we
became
accustomed
to
the
situation
and
turned
our
attention
to
the
unpromising
wall
of
rock
which
rose
beside
us
from
its
crevices
hung
graceful
festoons
of
bulblet
bladder
fern
and
apparently
nothing
but
bulblet
bladder
fern
but
soon
one
of
the
party
gave
a
cry
and
pointed
in
triumph
to
a
cluster
of
foliage
which
sprang
from
a
shallow
pocket
overhead
even
though
one
had
not
seen
the
plant
before
there
was
no
mistaking
the
wiry
purplish
stalks
the
leathery
pinnately
parted
fronds
and
above
all
the
marginal
rows
of
bright
brown
sporangia
peculiar
to
the
purple
cliff
brake
soon
after
we
found
several
other
plants
all
of
them
decidedly
scraggly
in
appearance
with
but
few
green
fronds
and
many
leafless
stalks
occasionally
a
small
sterile
frond
with
broader
more
oblong
pinnæ
could
be
seen
but
these
were
in
the
minority
a
number
of
very
young
plants
with
little
leaves
altogether
unlike
the
mature
fronds
were
wedged
in
neighboring
crannies
as
our
eyes
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
contour
and
coloring
of
the
cliffs
the
success
of
the
day
was
completed
by
the
discovery
of
several
specimens
of
the
little
rue
spleenwort
with
tiny
fronds
flattened
against
the
rock
when
next
i
saw
the

seemed
to
me
quite
a

the
rather
awkward

a
mistake

this
regard
you
chance
to
be
driving
by
a
bank
overgrown
with
the
early
meadow
rue
when
he
calls
your
attention
to
the
unusual
abundance
of
maidenhair
in
the
neighborhood
to
his
rather
indignant
surprise
you
suggest
that
the
plant
he
saw
was
not
maidenhair
but
the
early
meadow
rue
if
he
have
the
least
reverence
for
your
botanical
attainments
he
grudgingly
admits
that
possibly
it
was
not
the
ordinary
maidenhair
but
maintains
stoutly
that
it
was
a
more
uncommon
species
which
abounds
in
his
especial
neighborhood
if
truly
diplomatic
you
hold
your
peace
and
change
the
subject
but
if
possessed
by
a
tormenting
love
of
truth
which
is
always
getting
you
into
trouble
you
state
sadly
but
firmly
that
our
northeastern
states
have
but
one
species
of
maidenhair
and
that
it
is
more
than
improbable
that
the
favored
neighborhood
of
his
home
for
it
is
always
an
unusually
rich
locality
offers
another
the
result
of
this
discussion
is
that
mentally
you
are
pronounced
both
conceited
and
for
a
few
weeks
the
plants
in
question
are
passed
without
comment
but
by
another
summer
the
rich
growth
of
maidenhair
is
again
proudly
exhibited
only
in
one
way
can
you
save
your
reputation
and
possibly
convince
your
friend
when
correcting
him
if
you
glibly
remark
that
our
northeastern
maidenhair
is
the
only
species
which
has
been
found
in
this
part
of
the
country
that
the
maidenhair
which
somewhat
resembles
the
early
meadow
rue
can
hardly
be
found
north
of
virginia
while
is
found
only
in
florida
and
is
confined
to
the
pacific
coast
you
will
have
redeemed
yourself
not
from
the
stigma
of
conceit
far
from
it
but
from
that
of
error
the
glib
utterance
of
latin
names
is
attended
with
a
strange
power
of
silencing
your
opponent
and
filling
him
with
a
sort
of
grudging
belief
in
your
scientific
attainments
the
truth
is
that
the
average
layman
who
takes
an
interest
in
plants
is
as
sensitive
regarding
the
maidenhair
as
he
is
about
his
recognition
of
an
orchid
by
way
of
warning
what
more
need
be
said
though
the
maidenhair
has
a
wide
range
and
grows
abundantly
in
many
localities
it
possesses
a
quality
of
aloofness
which
adds
to
its
charm
even
in
neighborhoods
where
it
grows
profusely
it
rarely
crowds
to
the
roadside

becomes
the
companion
of
your
daily
walks
its
chosen
haunts
are
dim

hollows
in

retreats
you
find
the

in

find
also
the
very
spirit

two

during

an

drive
over
an

road
brought
us
to
a
picturesque
spot
where
the

tumbled
into

so
vividly
the

of
the
cool

there
we

were

frankly
own
that
i
never

have
been
more
than

believe
that

for
decorative
ends
in
the

age
they
do
not
lend
themselves
as
once
they
did
to
medicinal
purposes
usually
they
are
without
culinary
value
so
far
as
i
know
animals
refuse
to
eat
them
on
account
of
their
acrid
juices

experience
proves
that
when
used
as
a

they
do
not

thou
owedst

the

is
very
graceful
and
pleasing
when
growing
in

places
it
is
often
conspicuous
by
reason
of
its
bright
pink

reddish
stalks
which
contrast
effectively
with
the
delicate
green
of
the

in

judging
by
my
own
experience
the

loses
much
of
its
delicacy
many
of
its
fronds
become
disfigured
and
present
a
rather
blotched

coarse
appearance

seems
strange
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the

is
called
by
lowe
a

that
it
is
one

as
i
have
already
mentioned
in

description
of

on
a
chance
morning
call
i
learned
that
years
before
the
rue
spleenwort
and
the
purple
cliff
brake
had
been
found
on
certain
cliffs
which
overhung
some
neighboring
falls
on
these
very
cliffs
a
quarter
of
a
century
later
we
found
a
few
specimens
of
each
plant
the
tiny
fronds
of
the
rue
spleenwort
grew
from
small
fissures
in
the
cliffs
flattening
themselves
against
their
rocky
background
about
a
month
later
we
returned
to
the
spot
for
the
purpose
of
securing
photographs
of
the
natural
gallery
where
the
plants
grew
the
seamed
overhanging
rocks
the
neighboring
stream
plunging
nearly
two
hundred

to
the
ravine
below

bold
opposite

showing
here
and
there
through
their
cloak
of
trees
and
above
and
beyond
the
smiling
upland
pastures
the
hills
and
the
valley
had
left
a
picture
in
the
mind
that
we
hoped
to
reproduce
however
inadequately
by
means
of
the
camera
this
morning
we
had
approached
the
cliffs
from
an
opposite
direction
in
climbing
a
gradual
ascent
from
the
bed
of
the
stream
we
found
a
plant
of
the
rue
spleenwort
which
was
more
vigorous
and
thrifty
than
any
we
had
previously
seen
in
the
single
tuft
about
as
large
as
the
palm
of
one
hand
we
counted
green
fronds
their
lower
surfaces
in
many
cases
were
covered
with
confluent
the
plant
had
much
the
effect
of
a
rather
small
specimen
of
the
mountain
spleenwort
the
short
broad
fronds
were
somewhat
leathery
with
only
a
few
pinnæ
considering
its
lack
of
size
the
little
cluster
springing
from
the
bare
rock
made
so
definite
and
interesting
a
picture
that
we
tried
to
photograph
it
as
it
grew
but
after
some
time
spent
in
striving
to
secure
a
foothold
for
the
tripod
and
at
the
same
time
for
the
photographer
we
gave
up
the
attempt
as
hopeless

too

i
recall
one
drive
of
miles
devoted
to
hunting
up
a
rumored

at
the

of
the
day
which
turned
out
cold
and
rainy
and
fruitless
so
far
as
its
special
object
was
concerned
i
felt
inclined
to
believe
that
the

had
justified
its
title
and
had
walked
out
of
the
neighborhood
yet
after
all
no
such
expedition
even
with

and

against
one
as
in
this

is
really
fruitless

resolved
upon

a

miles
from

a
fork
in

in

noticed
just
such
a
large
shaded
rock
with
mossy
ledges
as
had
filled
us
with
vain
hopes
many
times
suggested
a
closer
examination
which
i
discouraged
remembering
previous
disappointments
but
something
in
the
look
of
the
great
bowlder
provoked
his
curiosity
so
over
the
fence

up
the
ledges
he
scrambled
almost
his
first

a
projecting
shelf

was
carpeted
with

fronds

one
who
has
not
spent
hours
in

such
search
as
this
can
sympathize
with
the
delight

those
moments
we
fairly
gloated
over
the
quaint
little
plants
following
with
our
fingers
the
slender
tips
of
the
fronds
till
they
rooted
in
the
moss
starting
another
generation
on
its
life

and
earning
for
itself
the
title
of
walking
leaf
or

although
since
then
i
have
found
the
walking
leaf
frequently
and
in
great
abundance
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen
it
make
so
fine

display
the
plants
were
unusually
large
and
vigorous

the
aspect
of
the
matted

losing
itself

great

ledyard

suddenly
we
heard
her
give
a
triumphant
shout
followed
by
the
joyful
announcement
that
she
had
found
the
hart
tongue
the
station
being
previously
quite
unknown
this
was
a
most
interesting
discovery
on
entering
the
ravine
we
had
discussed
its
possibility
but
i
had
fancied
that
any
hope
of
it
would
be
unfounded
as
i
supposed
the
ground
had
been
thoroughly
canvassed
by
the
many
botanists
who
had
visited
the
neighborhood
the
plants
were
still
young
but
large
and
vigorous
growing
in
a
partial
opening
among
the
basswoods
maples
and
beeches
on
a
steep
slope
covered
with
fragments
of
limestone
some
thirty
or
forty
feet
from
the
base
of
the
cliffs
we
must
have
found
from
twenty
to
thirty
plants
within
a
radius
of
as
many
feet
unfortunately
as
it
turned
out
the
discovery
found
its
way
to
the
columns
of
the
local
paper
and
on
our
return
to
the
station
some
weeks
later
our
eager
expectation
of
seeing
the
young
plants
in
the
splendor
of
maturity
was
crushed
by
finding
that
the
spot
had
been
ruthlessly
invaded
and
a
number
of
the
finest
plants
had
disappeared
before
long
it
will
be
necessary
for
botanists
to
form
a
secret
society
with
vows
of
silence

to
fern

some

the

rare

writes
of

it

pleasant

cheerful
nowadays
when
the
brown
and
withered
leaves
strew
the
ground

almost
every
plant
is
fallen

come
upon
a
patch
of
polypody

rocky

in

and
rustling
leaves
defying
frost
it
stands

freshly
green

of

was

that
of

the

were
it

i
found
the

growing
in

so
luxuriant
to

and
so
velvety
to
the
touch
that
it
hardly
suggested
the
bristly
looking
plant

one
finds
later
in

this

reverses
the
usual
order
of
things
being
in

in

the
result
that
in

even

upon

the

environment
has
much
to
do
with
the
charm
of

the
first
plant
of
this

i
ever

grew
on
a
rocky

within
a

flowed

they
were

them
not

i
was
advised

as

said

assured
me
that

had

account
of

is

in
its
enthusiasm
in
george
davenport
was
beginning
his
study
of
ferns
a
letter
from
him
asking
me
to
look
for
started
me
on
a
fern
hunt
the
species
had
been
found
on
willoughby
mountain
and
at
little
falls
might
it
not
be
growing
in
many
places
in
vermont
when
i
set
out
i
knew
as
i
must
suppose
not
a
single
fern
and
it
was
near
the
close
of
the
summer
you
can
imagine
what
delights
awaited
me
in
the
autumn
woodlands
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
not
a
few
ferns
though
it
was
too
late
to
prepare
good
specimens
of
them
in
this
first
blind
endeavor
i
got
of
course
no
clew
to
the
next
summer
the
hunt
was
renewed
and
persistently
followed
up
i
found
pleasure
in
securing
one
by
one
nearly
all
our
vermont
ferns
at
the
time
i
thought
it
worthy
of
remembrance
that
a
single
field
of
diversified
pasture
and
woodland
on
an
adjoining
farm
yielded
me
thirty
species
although
the
two
common
species
of
were
near
at
hand
was
still
eluding
my
search
i
sent
a
friend
to
the
summit
of
jay
peak
in
a
fruitless
quest
for
it
finally
on
september
i
joined
congdon
at
its
old
station
on
willoughby
mountain
and
made
myself
familiar
with
its
exquisite
form
during
the
first
two
years
of
my
collecting
in
earnest
and
several
visits
were
made
to
camel
hump
the
peak
most
accessible
to
me
in
this
way
some
time
was
lost
because
its
subalpine
area
is
limited
and
consequently
the
number
of
rare
plants
to
be
found
there
is
small
yet
with
such
dogged
persistence
as
sometimes
prevents
my
making
good
progress
my
last
visit
to
that
point
was
not
made
till
the
of
june
on
that
day
i
clambered
i
believe
over
every
shelf
of
its
great
southern
precipice
and
peered
into
every
fissure
among
the
rocks
at
last
as
i
was
climbing
up
the
apex
over
the
southeastern
buttress
my
perilous
toil
was
rewarded
by
the
discovery
not
only
of
but
of
there
were
only
a
few
depauperate
specimens
of
each
which
had
not
yet
succumbed
to
the
adverse
conditions
of
their
dry
and
exposed
situation
in
the
following
passage
pringle
describes
his
pleasure
some
years
later
in
the
companionships
fostered
by
a
common
interest
in
his
pet
hobby
my
delight
in
this
preserve
of
boreal
plants
was
shared
with
not
a
few
genial
botanists
charles
faxon
came
before
any
of
us
suspected
that
he
possessed
undeveloped
talent
for
a
botanical
artist
of
highest
excellence
edwin
faxon
followed
his
young
brother
and
with
me
made
the
tedious
ascent
to
stirling
pond
a
day
of
toil
well
rewarded
thomas
morong
came
before
the
hardships
of
his
paraguayan
journey
had
broken
him
down
our
honored
president
came
in
those
days
as
now
he
was
often
my
companion
to
add
delight
to
my
occupation
and
to
reinforce
my
enthusiasm
the
gentle
davenport
came
at
last
to
behold
for
the
first
time
in
their
native
haunts
many
of
the
objects
of
his
first
love
and
study
when
i
had
found
for
him
yet
once
more
in
a
fifth
vermont
station
this
was
under
checkerberry
ledge
near
bakersfield
the
fern
he
at
first
desired
and
together
with
that
had
discovered
within
our
limits
three
or
four
others
quite
as
rare
and
scarcely
expected
i
might
feel
that
i
had
complied
with
the
request
of
his
letter
but
that
letter
initiated
a
warm
friendship
between
us
and
association
in
work
upon
american
ferns
which
has
continued
to
the
present
time
during
these
years
of
botanical
travel
on
my
part
my
hands
have
gathered
all
but
of
the
one
hundred
and
species
of
north
american
ferns
and
from
the
more
remote
corners
of
our
continent
i
have
sent
home
to
my
friend
for
description
and
publication
sixteen
new
ones
yet
i
trust
that
the
fern
hunt
upon
which
he
started
me
in
is
still
far
from
its
close
the
above
quotations
illustrate
fairly
the
enthusiasm
aroused
by
a
pursuit
which
is
full
of
peculiar
fascination
almost
anyone
who
has
made
a
study
of
our
native
ferns
will
recall
hours
filled
with
delight

a
bowing
acquaintance
with
the
flowers
repays
one
generously
for
the
effort
expended
in
its
achievement
says
the
author
in
her
introduction
such
an
acquaintance
serves
to
transmute
the
tedium
of
a
railway
journey
into
the
excitement
of
a
tour
of
discovery
it
causes
the
monotony
of
a
drive
through
an
ordinarily
uninteresting
country
to
be
forgotten
in
the
diversion
of
noting
the
wayside
flowers
and
counting
a
hundred
different
species
where
formerly
less
than
a
dozen
would
have
been
detected
it
invests
each
boggy
meadow
and
bit
of
rocky
woodland
with
almost
irresistible
charm
she
has
systematized
her
facts
in
a
compact
and
convenient
form
she
is
practical
and
terse
and
is
also
alive
to
the
things
which
are
not
entirely
matters
of
fact
