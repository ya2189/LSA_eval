preface
while
this
volume
is
largely
of
an
autobiographical
character
it
will
be
found
to
contain
also
a
variety
of
general
information
concerning
the
war
of
more
particularly
with
respect
to
the
second
part
of
that
great
struggle
the
people
war
which
followed
the
crash
of
sedan
and
the
downfall
of
the
second
french
empire
if
i
have
incorporated
this
historical
matter
in
my
book
it
is
because
i
have
repeatedly
noticed
in
these
later
years
that
whilst
english
people
are
conversant
with
the
main
facts
of
the
sedan
disaster
and
such
subsequent
outstanding
events
as
the
siege
of
paris
and
the
capitulation
of
metz
they
usually
know
very
little
about
the
manner
in
which
the
war
generally
was
carried
on
by
the
french
under
the
virtual
dictatorship
of
gambetta
should
england
ever
be
invaded
by
a
large
hostile
force
we
with
our
very
limited
regular
army
should
probably
be
obliged
to
rely
largely
on
elements
similar
to
those
which
were
called
to
the
field
by
the
french
national
defence
government
of
after
the
regular
armies
of
the
empire
had
been
either
crushed
at
sedan
or
closely
invested
at
metz
for
that
reason
i
have
always
taken
a
keen
interest
in
our
territorial
force
well
realizing
what
heavy
responsibilities
would
fall
upon
it
if
a
powerful
enemy
should
obtain
a
footing
in
this
country
some
indication
of
those
responsibilities
will
be
found
in
the
present
book
generally
speaking
however
i
have
given
only
a
sketch
of
the
latter
part
of
the
war
to
have
entered
into
details
on
an
infinity
of
matters
would
have
necessitated
the
writing
of
a
very
much
longer
work
however
i
have
supplied
i
think
a
good
deal
of
precise
information
respecting
the
events
which
i
actually
witnessed
and
in
this
connexion
perhaps
i
may
have
thrown
some
useful
sidelights
on
the
war
generally
for
many
things
akin
to
those
which
i
saw
occurred
under
more
or
less
similar
circumstances
in
other
parts
of
france
people
who
are
aware
that
i
am
acquainted
with
the
shortcomings
of
the
french
in
those
already
distant
days
and
that
i
have
watched
as
closely
as
most
foreigners
can
watch
the
evolution
of
the
french
army
in
these
later
times
have
often
asked
me
what
to
my
thinking
would
be
the
outcome
of
another
war
for
many
years
i
fully
anticipated
another
struggle
between
the
two
powers
and
held
myself
in
readiness
to
do
duty
as
a
i
long
thought
also
that
the
signal
for
that
struggle
would
be
given
by
france
but
i
am
no
longer
of
that
opinion
i
fully
believe
that
all
french
statesmen
worthy
of
the
name
realize
that
it
would
be
suicidal
for
france
to
provoke
a
war
with
her
formidable
neighbour
and
at
the
same
time
i
candidly
confess
that
i
do
not
know
what
some
journalists
mean
by
what
they
call
the
new
france
to
my
thinking
there
is
no
new
france
at
all
there
was
as
much
spirit
as
much
patriotism
in
the
days
of
macmahon
in
the
days
of
boulanger
and
at
other
periods
as
there
is
now
the
only
real
novelty
that
i
notice
in
the
france
of
is
the
cultivation
of
many
branches
of
sport
and
athletic
exercise
of
that
kind
of
thing
there
was
very
little
indeed
when
i
was
a
stripling
but
granting
that
young
frenchmen
of
are
more
athletic
more
fit
than
were
those
of
my
generation
granting
moreover
that
the
present
organization
and
the
equipment
of
the
french
army
are
vastly
superior
to
what
they
were
in
and
also
that
the
conditions
of
warfare
have
greatly
changed
i
feel
that
if
france
were
to
engage
unaided
in
a
contest
with
germany
she
would
again
be
worsted
and
worsted
by
her
own
fault
she
fully
knows
that
she
can
not
bring
into
the
field
anything
like
as
many
men
as
germany
and
it
is
in
a
vain
hope
of
supplying
the
deficiency
that
she
has
lately
reverted
from
a
two
to
a
three
years
system
of
military
service
the
latter
certainly
gives
her
a
larger
effective
for
the
first
contingencies
of
a
campaign
but
in
all
other
respects
it
is
merely
a
piece
of
jugglery
for
it
does
not
add
a
single
unit
to
the
total
number
of
frenchmen
capable
of
bearing
arms
the
truth
is
that
during
forty
years
of
prosperity
france
has
been
intent
on
racial
suicide
in
the
whole
of
that
period
only
some
inhabitants
have
been
added
to
her
population
which
is
now
still
under
millions
whereas
that
of
germany
has
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
stands
at
about
millions
at
the
present
time
the
german
is
certainly
falling
but
the
numerical
superiority
which
germany
has
acquired
over
france
since
the
war
of
is
so
great
that
i
feel
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
latter
to
triumph
in
an
encounter
unless
she
should
be
assisted
by
powerful
allies
bismarck
said
in
that
god
was
on
the
side
of
the
big
battalions
and
those
big
battalions
germany
can
again
supply
i
hold
then
that
no
such
war
as
the
last
one
can
again
occur
europe
is
now
virtually
divided
into
two
camps
each
composed
of
three
powers
all
of
which
would
be
more
or
less
involved
in
a
struggle
the
allies
and
friends
on
either
side
are
well
aware
of
it
and
in
their
own
interests
are
bound
to
exert
a
restraining
influence
which
makes
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
we
have
had
evidence
of
this
in
the
limitations
imposed
on
the
recent
balkan
war
on
the
other
hand
it
is
of
course
the
unexpected
which
usually
happens
and
whilst
europe
generally
remains
armed
to
the
teeth
and
so
many
jealousies
are
still
rife
no
one
power
can
in
prudence
desist
from
her
armaments
we
who
are
the
wealthiest
nation
in
europe
spend
on
our
armaments
in
proportion
to
our
wealth
and
our
population
less
than
any
other
great
power
yet
some
among
us
would
have
us
curtail
our
expenditure
and
thereby
incur
the
vulnerability
which
would
tempt
a
foe
undoubtedly
the
armaments
of
the
present
day
are
great
and
grievous
burdens
on
the
nations
terrible
impediments
to
social
progress
but
they
constitute
unfortunately
our
only
real
insurance
against
war
justifying
yet
after
so
many
long
centuries
the
truth
of
the
ancient
latin
adage
vis
pacem
para
it
is
i
think
unnecessary
for
me
to
comment
here
on
the
autobiographical
part
of
my
book
it
will
i
feel
speak
for
itself
it
treats
of
days
long
past
and
on
a
few
points
perhaps
my
memory
may
be
slightly
defective
in
preparing
my
narrative
however
i
have
constantly
referred
to
my
old
diaries
and
early
newspaper
articles
and
have
done
my
best
to
abstain
from
all
exaggeration
whether
this
story
of
some
of
my
youthful
experiences
and
impressions
of
men
and
things
was
worth
telling
or
not

is

reminiscences
and
although
i
have
never

in

affairs
i
have
witnessed
so
many
notable
things
and
met
so
many
notable
people
during
the
years
which
i
have
lately
completed
that
it
is
perhaps
allowable
for
me
to
add
yet
another
volume
of
personal
recollections
to
the
many
which
have
already
poured
from
the
press
on
starting
on
an
undertaking
of
this
kind
it
is
usual
i
perceive
by
the
many
examples
around
me
to
say
something
about
family
and
upbringing
there
is
less
reason
for
me
to
depart
from
this
practice
as
in
the
course
of
the
present
volume
it
will
often
be
necessary
for
me
to
refer
to
some
of
my
near
relations
a
few
years
ago
a
distinguished
italian
philosopher
and
author
angelo
de
gubernatis
was
good
enough
to
include
me
in
a
dictionary
of
writers
belonging
to
the
latin
races
and
stated
in
doing
so
that
the
vizetellys
were
of
french
origin
that
was
a
rather
curious
mistake
on
the
part
of
an
italian
writer
the
truth
being
that
the
family
originated
at
ravenna
where
some
members
of
it
held
various
offices
in
the
middle
ages
subsequently
after
dabbling
in
a
conspiracy
some
of
the
vizzetelli
fled
to
venice
and
took
to
there
until
at
last
jacopo
from
whom
i
am
descended
came
to
england
in
the
spacious
days
of
queen
elizabeth
from
that
time
until
my
own
the
men
of
my
family
invariably
married
english
women
so
that
very
little
italian
blood
can
flow
in
my
veins
matrimonial
alliances
are
sometimes
of
more
than
personal
interest
one
point
has
particularly
struck
me
in
regard
to
those
contracted
by
members
of
my
own
family
this
being
the
diversity
of
english
counties
from
which
the
men
have
derived
their
wives
and
the
women
their
husbands
references
to
cheshire
lancashire
yorkshire
staffordshire
warwickshire
leicestershire
berkshire
bucks
suffolk
kent
surrey
sussex
and
devonshire
in
addition
to
middlesex
otherwise
london
appear
in

radfords
hindes
pollards
lemprières
wakes
godbolds
ansells
fennells
vaughans
edens
scotts
and
pearces
and
i
was
the
very
first
member
of
the
family
subsequent
to
its
arrival
in
england
to
take
a
foreigner
as
wife
she
being
the
daughter
of
a
landowner
of
savoy
who
proceeded
from
the
tissots
of
switzerland
my
elder
brother
edward
subsequently
married
a
burgundian
girl
named
clerget
and
my
stepbrother
frank
chose
an
american
one
krehbiel
as
his
wife
these
marriages
occurring
because
circumstances
led
us
to
live
for
many
years
abroad
among
the
first
london
parishes
with
which
the
family
was
connected
was
botolph
bishopsgate
where
my
forerunner
the
first
henry
vizetelly
was
buried
in
he
then
being
fifty
years
of
age
and
where
my
father
the
second
henry
of
the
name
was
baptised
soon
after
his
birth
in
bride
fleet
street
was
however
our
parish
for
many
years
as
its
registers
testify
though
in
my
was
resident
in
the
parish
of
ann
blackfriars
and
was
elected
constable
thereof
at
that
date
the
family
name
which
figures
in
old
english
registers
under
a
variety
of
forms
vissitaler
vissitaly
visataly
visitelly
vizetely
was
by
him
spelt
vizzetelly
as
is
shown
by
documents
now
in
the
guildhall
library
but
a
few
years
later
he
dropped
the
second
z
with
the
idea
perhaps
of
giving
the
name
a
more
english
appearance
this
of
mine
was
like
his
father
before
him
a
printer
and
a
member
of
the
stationers
company
he
was
twice
married
having
by
his
first
wife
two
sons
george
and
william
neither
of
whom
left
posterity
the
former
i
believe
died
in
the
service
of
the
honourable
east
india
company
in
june
however
my
married
elizabeth
daughter
of
james
hinde
stationer
of
little
moorfields
and
had
by
her
first
a
daughter
elizabeth
from
whom
some
of
the
burslems
and
godbolds
are
descended
and
secondly
twins
a
boy
and
a
girl
who
were
respectively
christened
james
henry
and
mary
mehetabel
the
former
became
my
grandfather
in
august
he
married
at
bride
martha
jane
vaughan
daughter
of
a
proprietor
of
chester
and
had
by
her
a
daughter
who
died
unmarried
and
four
sons
my
father
henry
richard
and
my
uncles
james
frank
and
frederick
whitehead
vizetelly
some
account
of
my
grandfather
is
given
in
my
father
glances
back
through
seventy
years
and
i
need
not
add
to
it
here
i
will
only
say
that
like
his
immediate
forerunners
james
henry
vizetelly
was
a
printer
and
freeman
of
the
city
a
clever
versifier
and
so
able
as
an
amateur
actor
that
on
certain
occasions
he
replaced
edmund
kean
on
the
boards
when
the
latter
was
hopelessly
drunk
he
died
in
leaving
his
two
elder
sons
james
and
henry
to
carry
on
the
printing
business
which
was
then
established
in
premises
occupying
the
site
of
the
building
in
fleet
street
in
my
father
married
ellen
elizabeth
only
child
of
john
pollard
a
member
of
the
ancient
yorkshire
family
of
the
pollards
of
bierley
and
brunton
now
chiefly
represented
i
believe
by
the
pollards
of
scarr
hall
john
pollard
wife
charlotte
maria
fennell
belonged
to
a
family
which
gave
officers
to
the
british
navy
one
of
them
serving
directly
under
nelson
and
clergy
to
the
church
of
england
the
fennells
were
related
to
the
brontë
sisters
through
the
latter
mother
and
one
was
closely
connected
with
the
shackle
who
founded
the
original
newspaper
those
then
were
my
kinsfolk
on
the
maternal
side
my
mother
presented
my
father
with
seven
children
of
whom
i
was
the
sixth
being
also
the
fourth
son
i
was
born
on
november
at
a
house
called
chalfont
lodge
in
campden
house
road
kensington
and
well
do
i
remember
the
great
conflagration
which
destroyed
the
fine
old
historical
mansion
built
by
baptist
hicks
sometime
a
mercer
in
cheapside
and
ultimately
viscount
campden
but
another
scene
which
has
more
particularly
haunted
me
all
through
my
life
was
that
of
my
mother
sudden
death
in
a
saloon
carriage
of
an
express
train
on
the
london
and
brighton
line
though
she
was
in
failing
health
nobody
thought
her
end
so
near
but
in
the
very
midst
of
a
journey
to
london
whilst
the
train
was
rushing
on
at
full
speed
and
no
help
could
be
procured
a
sudden
weakness
came
over
her
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
passed
away
i
was
very
young
at
the
time
barely
five
years
old
yet
everything
still
rises
before
me
with
all
the
vividness
of
an
imperishable
memory
again
too
i
see
that
beautiful
intellectual
brow
and
those
lustrous
eyes
and
hear
that
musical
voice
and
feel
the
gentle
touch
of
that
loving
motherly
hand
she
was
a
woman
of
attainments
fond
of
setting
words
to
music
speaking
perfect
french
for
she
had
been
partly
educated
at
evreux
in
normandy
and
having
no
little
knowledge
of
greek
and
latin
literature
as
was
shown
by
her
annotations
to
a
copy
of
lemprière
classical
dictionary
which
is
now
in
my
possession
about
eighteen
months
after
i
was
born
that
is
in
the
midst
of
the
crimean
war
my
father
founded
in
conjunction
with
david
bogue
a
publisher
of
the
time
a
journal
called
the
which
for
several
years
competed
successfully
with
the
london
it
was
issued
at
threepence
per
copy
and
an
old
memorandum
of
the
printers
now
lying
before
me
shows
that
in
the
paper
earlier
years
the
average
printings
were
copies
weekly
a
notable
figure
for
that
period
and
one
which
was
considerably
exceeded
when
any
really
important
event
occurred
my
father
was
the
chief
editor
and
manager
his
leading
coadjutor
being
frederick
greenwood
who
afterwards
founded
the
mall
i
do
not
think
that
greenwood
connection
with
the
and
with
my
other
journal
the
is
mentioned
in
any
of
the
accounts
of
his
career
the
literary
staff
included
four
of
the
brothers
mayhew
henry
jules
horace
and
augustus
two
of
whom
jules
and
horace
became
godfathers
to
my
father
first
children
by
his
second
wife
then
there
were
also
william
and
robert
brough
edmund
yates
george
augustus
sala
hain
friswell
rands
tom
robertson
sutherland
edwards
james
hannay
edward
draper
and
hale
white
father
of
mark
rutherford
and
several
artists
and
engravers
such
as
birket
foster
phiz
portch
andrews
duncan
skelton
bennett
mcconnell
linton
london
and
horace
harrall
i
saw
all
those
men
in
my
early
years
for
my
father
was
very
hospitably
inclined
and
they
were
often
guests
at
chalfont
lodge
after
my
mother
death
my
grandmother
vaughan
took
charge
of
the
establishment
and
i
soon
became
the
terror
of
the
house
developing
a
most
violent
temper
and
acquiring
the
vocabulary
of
the
roughest
market
porter
my
wilfulness
was
probably
innate
nearly
all
the
vizetellys
having
had
impulsive
wills
of
their
own
and
my
flowery
language
was
picked
up
by
perversely
loitering
to
listen
whenever
there
happened
to
be
a
street
row
in
church
lane
which
i
had
to
cross
on
my
way
to
or
from
kensington
gardens
my
daily
place
of
resort
at
an
early
age
i
started
bullying
my
younger
brother
i
defied
my
grandmother
insulted
the
family
doctor
because
he
was
too
fond
of
prescribing
grey
powders
for
my
particular
benefit
and
behaved
abominably
to
the
excellent
miss
lindup
of
sheffield
terrace
who
endeavoured
to
instruct
me
in
the
rudiments
of
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
i
frequently
astonished
or
appalled
the
literary
men
and
artists
who
were
my
father
guests
i
hated
being
continually
asked
what
i
should
like
to
be
when
i
grew
up
and
the
slightest
chaff
threw
me
into
a
perfect
paroxysm
of
passion
whilst
however
i
was
resentful
of
the
authority
of
others
i
was
greatly
inclined
to
exercise
authority
myself
to
such
a
degree
indeed
that
my
father
servants
generally
spoke
of
me
as
the
young
master
regardless
of
the
existence
of
my
elder
brothers
having
already
a
retentive
memory
i
was
set
to
learn
sundry
recitations
and
every
now
and
then
was
called
upon
to
emerge
from
behind
the
curtains
and
repeat
my
name
is
norval
or
the
spanish
armada
for
the
delectation
of
my
father
friends
whilst
they
lingered
over
their
wine
disaster
generally
ensued
provoked
either
by
some
genial
chaff
or
criticism
from
such
men
as
sala
and
augustus
mayhew
and
i
was
ultimately
carried
off
whilst
venting
incoherent
protests
to
be
soundly
castigated
and
put
to
bed
among
the
real
celebrities
who
occasionally
called
at
chalfont
lodge
was
thackeray
whom
i
can
still
picture
sitting
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
whilst
my
father
sat
on
the
other
i
being
installed
on
the
hearthrug
between
them
provided
that
i
was
left
to
myself
i
could
behave
decently
enough
discreetly
preserving
silence
and
indeed
listening
intently
to
the
conversation
of
my
father
friends
and
thereby
picking
up
a
very
odd
mixture
of
knowledge
i
was
i
believe
a
pale
little
chap
with
lank
fair
hair
and
a
wistful
face
and
no
casual
observer
would
have
imagined
that
my
nature
was
largely
compounded
of
such
elements
as
enter
into
the
composition
of
italian
brigands
scandinavian
pirates
and
wild
welshmen
thackeray
at
all
events
did
not
appear
to
think
badly
of
the
little
boy
who
sat
so
quietly
at
his
feet
one
day
indeed
when
he
came
upon
me
and
my
younger
brother
arthur
with
our
devoted
attendant
selina
horrocks
in
kensington
gardens
he
put
into
practice
his
own
dictum
that
one
could
never
see
a
schoolboy
without
feeling
an
impulse
to
dip
one
hand
in
one
pocket
accordingly
he
presented
me
with
the
first
i
ever
possessed
for
though
my
father
gifts
were
frequent
they
were
small
it
was
understood
i
believe
that
i
was
to
share
the
aforesaid
with
my
brother
arthur
but
in
spite
of
the
many
remonstrances
of
the
faithful
selina
a
worthy
woman
who
had
largely
taken
my
mother
place
i
appropriated
the
gift
in
its
entirety
and
became
extremely
ill
by
reason
of
my
many
indiscreet
purchases
at
a
which
stood
if
i
remember
rightly
at
a
corner
of
the
then
renowned
kensington
flower
walk
this
incident
must
have
occurred
late
in
thackeray
life
my
childish
recollection
of
him
is
that
of
a
very
big
gentleman
with
beaming
eyes
my
grandmother
reign
in
my
father
house
was
not
of
great
duration
as
in
february
he
contracted
a
second
marriage
taking
on
this
occasion
as
his
wife
a
fair
maid
of
kent
elizabeth
anne
ansell
of
broadstairs
mother
of
my
frank
vizetelly
editor
of
the
standard
dictionary
new
york
to
whose
entry
into
our
home
i
was
at
first
violently
opposed
but
who
promptly
won
me
over
by
her
unremitting
affection
and
kindness
eventually
becoming
the
best
and
truest
friend
of
my
youth
and
early
manhood
my
circumstances
changed
however
soon
after
that
marriage
for
as
i
was
now
nearly
eight
years
old
it
was
deemed
appropriate
that
i
should
be
sent
to
a
both
by
way
of
improving
my
mind
and
of
having
some
nonsense
knocked
out
of
me
which
indeed
was
promptly
accomplished
by
the
pugnacious
kindness
of
my
schoolfellows
among
the
latter
was
one
my
senior
by
a
few
years
who
became
a
very
distinguished
journalist
i
refer
to
the
late
horace
voules
so
long
associated
with
labouchere
journal
my
brother
edward
was
also
at
the
same
school
and
my
brother
arthur
came
there
a
little
later
it
was
situated
at
eastbourne
and
a
good
deal
has
been
written
about
it
in
recent
works
on
the
history
of
that
which
when
i
was
first
sent
there
counted
less
than
inhabitants
located
in
the
old
town
or
village
at
a
distance
of
a
mile
or
more
from
the
sea
the
school
occupied
a
building
called
the
gables
and
was
an
offshoot
of
a
former
ancient
school
connected
with
the
famous
parish
church
in
my
time
this
academy
was
carried
on
as
a
private
venture
by
a
certain
james
anthony
bown
a
portly
old
gentleman
of
considerable
attainments
i
was
unusually
precocious
in
some
respects
and
though
i
frequently
got
into
scrapes
by
playing
impish
tricks
as
for
instance
when
i
combined
with
others
to
secure
an
obnoxious
french
master
to
his
chair
by
means
of
some
cobbler
wax
thereby
ruining
a
beautiful
pair
of
trousers
which
he
had
just
purchased
i
did
not
neglect
my
lessons
but
secured
a
number
of
prizes
with
considerable
facility
when
i
was
barely
twelve
years
old
not
one
of
my
schoolfellows
and
some
were
sixteen
and
seventeen
years
old
could
compete
with
me
in
latin
in
which
language
bown
ended
by
taking
me
separately
i
also
won
three
or
four
prizes
for
excelling
my
successive
classes
in
english
grammar
as
prescribed
by
the
celebrated
lindley
murray
in
spite
of
my
misdeeds
some
of
which
fortunately
were
never
brought
home
to
me
i
became
i
think
somewhat
of
a
favourite
with
the
worthy
james
anthony
for
he
lent
me
interesting
books
to
read
occasionally
had
me
to
supper
in
his
own
quarters
and
was
now
and
then
good
enough
to
overlook
the
swollen
state
of
my
nose
or
the
blackness
of
one
of
my
eyes
when
i
had
been
having
a
bout
with
a
schoolfellow
or
a
young
clodhopper
of
the
village
we
usually
fought
with
the
village
lads
in
love
lane
on
sunday
evenings
after
getting
over
the
playground
wall
i
received
firstly
the
nickname
of
moses
through
falling
among
some
rushes
whilst
fielding
a
ball
at
cricket
and
secondly
that
of
noses
because
my
nasal
organ
like
that
of
cyrano
de
bergerac
suddenly
grew
to
huge
proportions
in
such
wise
that
it
embodied
sufficient
material
for
two
noses
of
ordinary
dimensions
its
size
was
largely
responsible
for
my
defeats
when
fighting
for
i
found
it
difficult
to
keep
guard
over
such
a
prominent
organ
and
prevent
my
claret
from
being
tapped
having
generations
of
printers
ink
mingled
with
my
blood
i
could
not
escape
the
unkind
fate
which
made
me
a
writer
of
articles
and
books
in
conjunction
with
a
chum
named
clement
ireland
i
ran
a
manuscript
school
journal
which
included
stories
of
pirates
and
highwaymen
illustrated
with
lurid
designs
in
which
red
ink
was
plentifully
employed
in
order
to
picture
the
gore
which
flowed
so
freely
through
the
various
tales
my
grandmother
vaughan
was
an
inveterate
reader
of
the
and
the
and
whenever
i
went
home
for
my
holidays
i
used
to
pounce
upon
those
journals
and
devour
some
of
the
stories
of
the
author
of
minnegrey
as
well
as
miss
braddon
aurora
floyd
and
henry
dunbar
the
perusal
of
books
by
ainsworth
scott
lever
marryat
james
grant
james
dumas
and
whyte
melville
gave
me
additional
material
for
storytelling
and
so
concocting
wonderful
blends
of
all
sorts
of
fiction
i
spun
many
a
yarn
to
my
schoolfellows
in
the
dormitory
in
which
i
slept
yarns
which
were
sometimes
supplied
in
instalments
being
kept
up
for
a
week
or
longer
my
summer
holidays
were
usually
spent
in
the
country
but
at
other
times
i
went
to
london
and
was
treated
to
interesting
sights
at
kensington
in
my
earlier
years
i
often
saw
queen
victoria
and
the
prince
consort
with
their
children
notably
the
princess
royal
empress
frederick
and
the
prince
of
wales
edward
vii
when
the
married
the
daughter
from
over
the
sea
since
then
our
admired
and
gracious
queen
alexandra
and
they
drove
together
through
the
crowded
streets
of
london
on
their
way
to
windsor
i
came
specially
from
eastbourne
to
witness
that
triumphal
progress
and
even
now
i
can
picture
the
young
prince
with
his
round
chubby
face
and
little
and
the
vision
of
almost
beauty
in
blue
and
white
which
swept
past
my
eager
boyish
eyes
during
the
easter
holidays
of
garibaldi
came
to
england
my
uncle
frank
vizetelly
was
the
chief
of
that
period
the
predecessor
in
fact
of
the
late
melton
prior
he
knew
garibaldi
well
having
first
met
him
during
the
war
of
and
having
subsequently
accompanied
him
during
his
campaign
through
sicily
and
then
on
to
naples
afterwards
moreover
staying
with
him
at
caprera
and
so
my
uncle
carried
me
and
his
son
my
cousin
albert
to
stafford
house
where
he
had
the
and
the
liberator
patted
us
on
the
head
called
us
his
children
and
at
frank
vizetelly
request
gave
us
photographs
of
himself
i
then
little
imagined
that
i
should
next
see
him
in
france
at
the
close
of
the
war
with
germany
during
a
part
of
which
my
brother
edward
acted
as
one
of
his
orderly
officers
my
father
being
at
the
head
of
a
prominent
london
newspaper
often
received
tickets
for
one
and
another
theatre
thus
during
my
winter
holidays
i
saw
many
of
the
old
pantomimes
at
drury
lane
and
elsewhere
i
also
well
remember
sothern
lord
dundreary
and
a
play
called
the
duke
motto
which
was
based
on
paul
féval
novel
le
bossu
i
frequently
witnessed
the
entertainments
given
by
the
german
reeds
corney
grain
and
woodin
the
clever
artist
i
likewise
remember
leotard
the
acrobat
at
the
alhambra
and
sundry
performances
at
the
old
pantheon
where
i
heard
such
popular
songs
as
the
captain
with
the
whiskers
and
the
charming
young
widow
i
met
in
the
train
nigger
ditties
were
often
the
rage
during
my
boyhood
and
some
of
them
like
and
so
early
in
the
morning
still
linger
in
my
memory
then
too
there
were
such
songs
as
billy
taylor
i
afloat
hang
my
harp
on
a
willow
tree
and
an
inane
composition
which
contained
the
lines
when
a
lady
elopes
down
a
ladder
of
ropes
she
may
go
she
may
go
she
may
go
to
hongkong
for
me
in
those
schoolboy
days
of
mine
however
the
song
of
songs
to
my
thinking
was
one
which
we
invariably
sang
on
breaking
up
for
the
holidays
whether
it
was
peculiar
to
eastbourne
or
had
been
derived
from
some
other
school
i
can
not
say
i
only
know
that
the
last
verse
ran
approximately
as
follows
magistrorum
is
a
borum
has
made
his
bow
let
us
cry
cockalorum
that
the
latin
for
us
now
alpha
beta
gamma
delta
off
to
greece
for
we
are
free
helter
skelter
melter
pelter
we
the
lads
for
mirth
and
spree
for
cockalorum
be
it
noted
we
frequently
substituted
the
name
of
some
particularly
obnoxious
master
to
return
to
the
interesting
sights
of
my
boyhood
i
have
some
recollection
of
the
exhibition
of
but
can
recall
more
vividly
a
visit
to
the
crystal
palace
towards
the
end
of
the
following
year
when
i
there
saw
the
strange
oar
of
the
giant
balloon
in
which
nadar
the
photographer
and
aeronaut
had
lately
made
with
his
wife
and
others
a
memorable
and
disastrous
aerial
voyage
readers
of
jules
verne
will
remember
that
nadar
figures
conspicuously
in
his
journey
to
the
moon
quite
a
party
of
us
went
to
the
palace
to
see
the
giant
car
and
nadar
standing
over
six
feet
high
with
a
great
tangled
mane
of
frizzy
flaxen
hair
a
ruddy
moustache
and
a
red
shirt
garibaldi
took
us
inside
it
and
showed
us
all
the
accommodation
it
contained
for
eating
sleeping
and
photographic
purposes
i
could
not
follow
what
he
said
for
i
then
knew
only
a
few
french
words
and
i
certainly
had
no
idea
that
i
should
one
day
ascend
into
the
air
with
him
in
a
car
of
a
very
different
type
that
of
the
captive
balloon
which
for
purposes
of
military
observation
he
installed
on
the
place
saint
pierre
at
montmartre
during
the
german
siege
of
paris
a
time
came
when
my
father
disposed
of
his
interest
in
the
and
repaired
to
paris
to
take
up
the
position
of
continental
representative
of
the
london
my
brother
edward
at
that
time
a
student
at
the
école
des
beaux
arts
then
became
his
assistant
and
a
little
later
i
was
taken
across
the
channel
with
my
brother
arthur
to
join
the
rest
of
the
family
we
lived
first
at
auteuil
and
then
at
passy
where
i
was
placed
in
a
called
the
institution
nouissel
where
lads
were
prepared
for
admission
to
the
state
or
municipal
colleges
there
had
been
some
attempt
to
teach
me
french
at
eastbourne
but
it
had
met
with
little
success
partly
i
think
because
i
was
prejudiced
against
the
french
generally
regarding
them
as
a
mere
race
of
whom
we
had
deservedly
whacked
at
waterloo
eventually
my
prejudices
were
in
a
measure
overcome
by
what
i
heard
from
our
a
retired
officer
who
had
served
in
the
crimea
and
who
told
us
some
rousing
anecdotes
about
the
gallantry
of
our
allies
at
the
alma
and
elsewhere
in
the
result
the
old
converse
gave
me
furiously
to
think
that
there
might
be
some
good
in
the
french
after
all
at
nouissel
i
acquired
some
knowledge
of
the
language
rapidly
enough
and
i
was
afterwards
placed
in
the
charge
of
a
tutor
a
clever
scamp
named
brossard
who
prepared
me
for
the
lycée
bonaparte
now
condorcet
where
i
eventually
became
a
pupil
brossard
still
continuing
to
coach
me
with
a
view
to
my
passing
various
examinations
and
ultimately
securing
the
usual
without
which
nobody
could
then
be
anything
at
all
in
france
in
the
same
way
he
coached
evelyn
jerrold
son
of
blanchard
and
grandson
of
douglas
jerrold
both
of
whom
were
on
terms
of
close
friendship
with
the
vizetellys
but
while
brossard
was
a
clever
man
he
was
also
an
unprincipled
one
and
although
i
was
afterwards
indebted
to
him
for
an
introduction
to
old
general
changarnier
to
whom
he
was
related
it
would
doubtless
have
been
all
the
better
if
he
had
not
introduced
me
to
some
other
people
with
whom
he
was
connected
he
lived
for
a
while
with
a
woman
who
was
not
his
wife
and
deserted
her
for
a
girl
of
eighteen
whom
he
also
abandoned
in
order
to
devote
himself
to
a
creature
in
fleshings
who
rode
a
steed
at
the
cirque
de
when
i
was
first
introduced
to
her
behind
the
scenes
she
was
bestriding
a
chair
and
smoking
a
pink
cigarette
and
she
addressed
me
as
briefly
the
moral
atmosphere
of
brossard
life
was
not
such
as
befitted
him
to
be
a
mentor
of
youth
let
me
now
go
back
a
little
at
the
time
of
the
great
paris
exhibition
of
i
was
in
my
fourteenth
year
the
city
was
then
crowded
with
royalties
many
of
whom
i
saw
on
one
or
another
occasion
i
was
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
with
my
father
when
after
a
great
review
a
shot
was
fired
at
the
carriage
in
which
napoleon
iii
and
his
guest
alexander
ii
of
russia
were
seated
side
by
side
i
saw
equerry
raimbeaux
gallop
forward
to
screen
the
two
monarchs
and
i
saw
the
culprit
seized
by
a
sergeant
of
our
royal
engineers
attached
to
the
british
section
of
the
exhibition
both
sovereigns
stood
up
in
the
carriage
to
show
that
they
were
uninjured
and
it
was
afterwards
reported
that
the
emperor
napoleon
said
to
the
emperor
alexander
if
that
shot
was
fired
by
an
italian
it
was
meant
for
me
if
by
a
pole
it
was
meant
for
your
majesty
whether
those
words
were
really
spoken
or
were
afterwards
invented
as
such
things
often
are
by
some
clever
journalist
i
can
not
say
but
the
man
proved
to
be
a
pole
named
berezowski
who
was
subsequently
sentenced
to
transportation
for
life
it
was
in
connection
with
this
attempt
on
the
czar
that
i
did
my
first
little
bit
of
journalistic
work
by
my
father
directions
i
took
a
few
notes
and
made
a
hasty
little
sketch
of
the
surroundings
this
and
my
explanations
enabled
jules
pelcoq
an
artist
of
belgian
birth
whom
my
father
largely
employed
on
behalf
of
the
london
to
make
a
drawing
which
appeared
on
the
first
page
of
that
journal
next
issue
i
do
not
think
that
any
other
paper
in
the
world
was
able
to
supply
a
pictorial
representation
of
berezowski
attempt
i
have
said
enough
i
think
to
show
that
i
was
a
precocious
lad
perhaps
indeed
a
great
deal
too
precocious
however
i
worked
very
hard
in
those
days
my
hours
at
bonaparte
were
from
ten
to
twelve
and
from
two
to
four
i
had
also
to
prepare
for
the
lycée
take
special
lessons
from
brossard
and
again
lessons
in
german
from
a
tutor
named
with
then
too
my
brother
edward
ceasing
to
act
as
my
father
assistant
in
order
to
devote
himself
to
journalism
on
his
own
account
i
had
to
take
over
a
part
of
his
duties
one
of
my
cousins
montague
vizetelly
son
of
my
uncle
james
who
was
the
head
of
our
family
came
from
england
however
to
assist
my
father
in
the
more
serious
work
such
as
i
by
reason
of
my
youth
could
not
yet
perform
my
spare
time
was
spent
largely
in
taking
instructions
to
artists
or
fetching
drawings
from
them
at
one
moment
i
might
be
at
and
at
another
in
the
quartier
latin
calling
on
pelcoq
anastasi
janet
lange
gustave
janet
pauquet
thorigny
gaildrau
deroy
bocourt
darjou
lix
moulin
fichot
blanchard
or
other
artists
who
worked
for
the
london
occasionally
a
sketch
was
posted
to
england
but
more
frequently
i
had
to
despatch
some
drawing
on
wood
by
rail
though
i
have
never
been
anything
but
an
amateurish
draughtsman
myself
i
certainly
developed
a
critical
faculty
and
acquired
a
knowledge
of
different
artistic
methods
during
my
intercourse
with
so
many
of
the
of
the
last
years
of
the
second
empire
more
serious
duties
were
allotted
to
me
the
paris
fashions
design
then
appearing
every
month
in
the
london
was
for
a
time
prepared
according
to
certain
dresses
which
worth
and
other
famous
costumiers
made
for
empresses
queens
princesses
great
ladies
and
theatrical
celebrities
and
accompanying
pelcoq
or
janet
when
they
went
to
sketch
those
gowns
nowadays
one
would
simply
obtain
photographs
i
took
down
from
or
sometimes
from
worth
himself
full
particulars
respecting
materials
and
styles
in
order
that
the
descriptive
letterpress
which
was
to
accompany
the
illustration
might
be
correct
in
this
wise
i
served
my
apprenticeship
to
journalism
my
father
naturally
revised
my
work
the
first
article
all
my
own
which
appeared
in
print
was
one
on
that
notorious
theatrical
institution
the
claque
i
sent
it
to
a
which
dallas
then
edited
and
knowing
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
my
father
and
feeling
very
diffident
respecting
the
merits
of
what
i
had
written
i
assumed
a
de
charles
ludhurst
for
the
occasion
needless
to
say
that
i
was
delighted
when
i
saw
the
article
in
print
and
yet
more
so
when
i
received
for
it
a
couple
of
guineas
which
i
speedily
expended
on
gloves
neckties
and
a
here
let
me
say
that
we
were
rather
swagger
young
fellows
at
bonaparte
we
did
not
have
to
wear
hideous
uniforms
like
other
lycéens
but
endeavoured
to
present
a
very
smart
appearance
thus
we
made
it
a
practice
to
wear
gloves
and
to
carry
or
canes
on
our
way
to
or
from
the
lycée
i
even
improved
on
that
by
buying
at
the
beside
the
madeleine
and
this
idea
catching
on
as
the
phrase
goes
quite
a
commotion
occurred
one
morning
when
virtually
half
my
classmates
were
found
wearing
flowers
for
it
happened
to
be
la
saint
henri
the
of
the
count
de
chambord
and
both
our
proviseur
and
our
professor
imagined
that
this
was
on
our
part
a
seditious
legitimist
demonstration
there
were
however
very
few
legitimists
among
us
though
orleanists
and
republicans
were
numerous
i
have
mentioned
that
my
first
article
was
on
the
claque
that
organisation
established
to
encourage
applause
in
theatres
it
being
held
that
the
parisian
spectator
required
to
be
roused
by
some
such
method
brossard
having
introduced
me
to
the
of
the
claque
at
the
opéra
comique
i
often
obtained
admission
to
that
house
as
a
i
even
went
to
a
few
other
theatres
in
the
same
capacity
further
brossard
knew
sundry
authors
and
journalists
and
took
me
to
the
café
de
suède
and
the
café
de
madrid
where
i
saw
and
heard
some
of
the
celebrities
of
the
day
i
can
still
picture
the
great
dumas
loud
of
voice
and
exuberant
in
gesture
whilst
holding
forth
to
a
band
of
young
spongers
on
whom
he
was
spending
his
last
napoleons
i
can
also
see
gambetta
young
slim
and
bearded
with
a
full
sensual
underlip
seated
at
the
same
table
as
delescluze
whose
hair
and
beard
once
red
had
become
a
dingy
white
whose
figure
was
emaciated
and
angular
and
whose
yellowish
wrinkled
face
seemed
to
betoken
that
he
was
possessed
by
some
fixed
idea
what
that
idea
was
the
commune
subsequently
showed
again
i
can
see
henri
rochefort
and
gustave
flourens
together
the
former
straight
and
sinewy
with
a
great
tuft
of
very
dark
curly
hair
flashing
eyes
and
high
and
prominent
cheekbones
while
the
latter
tall
and
bald
with
long
moustaches
and
a
flowing
beard
gazed
at
you
in
an
eager
imperious
way
as
if
he
were
about
to
issue
some
command
other
men
who
helped
to
overthrow
the
empire
also
became
known
to
me
my
father
whilst
engaged
in
some
costly
litigation
respecting
a
large
castellated
house
which
he
had
leased
at
le
vésinet
secured
jules
favre
as
his
advocate
and
on
various
occasions
i
went
with
him
to
residence
here
let
me
say
that
my
father
in
spite
of
all
his
interest
in
french
literature
did
not
know
the
language
he
could
scarcely
express
himself
in
it
and
thus
he
always
made
it
a
practice
to
have
one
of
his
sons
with
him
we
having
inherited
our
mother
linguistic
gifts
command
of
language
was
great
but
his
eloquence
was
by
no
means
rousing
and
i
well
remember
that
when
he
pleaded
for
my
father
the
three
judges
of
the
appeal
court
composed
themselves
to
sleep
and
did
not
awaken
until
the
counsel
opposed
to
us
started
banging
his
fist
and
shouting
in
thunderous
tones
naturally
enough
as
the
judges
never
heard
our
side
of
the
case
but
only
our
adversary
they
decided
against
us
some
retrenchment
then
became
necessary
on
my
father
part
and
he
sent
my
her
children
and
my
brother
arthur
to
saint
servan
in
brittany
where
he
rented
a
house
which
was
called
la
petite
amélia
after
george
iii
daughter
of
that
name
who
during
some
interval
of
peace
between
france
and
great
britain
went
to
stay
at
saint
servan
for
the
benefit
of
her
health
the
majority
of
our
family
having
repaired
there
and
my
cousin
monty
returning
to
england
some
time
in
i
remained
alone
with
my
father
in
paris
we
resided
in
what
i
may
call
a
bachelor
flat
at
no
rue
de
miromesnil
near
the
elysée
palace
the
principal
part
of
the
house
was
occupied
by
the
count
and
countess
de
chateaubriand
and
their
daughters
the
countess
was
good
enough
to
take
some
notice
of
me
and
subsequently
when
she
departed
for
combourg
at
the
approach
of
the
german
siege
she
gave
me
full
permission
to
make
use
if
necessary
of
the
coals
and
wood
left
in
the
chateaubriand
cellars
in
the
date
i
have
now
reached
i
was
in
my
sixteenth
year
still
studying
and
at
the
same
time
giving
more
and
more
assistance
to
my
father
in
connection
with
his
journalistic
work
he
has
included
in
his
glances
back
some
account
of
the
facilities
which
enabled
him
to
secure
adequate
pictorial
delineation
of
the
court
life
of
the
empire
he
has
told
the
story
of
moulin
the
who
frequently
watched
over
the
emperor
personal
safety
and
who
also
supplied
sketches
of
court
functions
for
the
use
of
the
london
napoleon
iii
resembled
his
in
at
least
one
respect
he
fully
understood
the
art
of
advertisement
and
in
his
desire
to
be
thought
well
of
in
england
he
was
always
ready
to
favour
english
journalists
whilst
a
certain
part
of
the
london
press
preserved
throughout
the
reign
a
very
critical
attitude
towards
the
imperial
policy
it
is
certain
that
some
of
the
paris
correspondents
were
in
close
touch
with
the
emperor
government
and
that
some
of
them
were
actually
subsidized
by
it
the
man
with
respect
to
court
and
social
events
was
undoubtedly
felix
whiteburst
of
daily
whom
i
well
remember
he
had
the
at
the
tuileries
and
elsewhere
and
there
were
occasions
when
very
important
information
was
imparted
to
him
with
a
view
to
its
early
publication
in
london
for
the
most
part
however
whitehurst
confined
himself
to
chronicling
events
or
incidents
occurring
at
court
or
in
bonapartist
high
society
anxious
to
avoid
giving
offence
he
usually
glossed
over
any
scandal
that
occurred
or
dismissed
it
airily
with
the
of
a
of
the
regency
withal
he
was
an
extremely
amiable
man
very
condescending
towards
me
when
we
met
as
sometimes
happened
at
the
tuileries
itself
i
had
to
go
there
on
several
occasions
to
meet
moulin
the
by
appointment
and
a
few
years
ago
this
helped
me
to
write
a
book
which
has
been
more
than
once
reprinted
note
i
utilized
in
it
many
notes
made
by
me
in
notably
with
respect
to
the
emperor
and
empress
private
apartments
the
kitchens
and
the
arrangements
made
for
balls
and
banquets
i
am
not
aware
at
what
age
a
young
fellow
is
usually
provided
with
his
first
but
i
know
that
mine
was
made
about
the
time
i
speak
of
i
was
then
i
suppose
about
five
feet
five
inches
in
height
and
my
face
led
people
to
suppose
that
i
was
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
of
age
note
the
work
in
question
was
entitled
the
court
of
the
tuileries
by
le
petit
homme
rouge
a
pseudonym
which
i
have
since
used
when
producing
other
books
the
court
of
the
tuileries
was
founded
in
part
on
previously
published
works
on
a
quantity
of
notes
and
memoranda
made
by
my
father
other
relatives
and
myself
and
on
some
of
the
private
papers
of
one
of
my
wife
kinsmen
general
mollard
who
after
greatly
distinguishing
himself
at
the
tchernaya
and
magenta
became
for
a
time
an
to
napoleon
iii
in
the
autumn
of
i
fell
rather
ill
from
i
had
already
begun
to
read
up
roman
law
and
on
securing
a
holiday
i
accompanied
my
father
to
compiègne
where
the
imperial
court
was
then
staying
we
were
not
among
the
invited
guests
but
it
had
been
arranged
that
every
facility
should
be
given
to
the
london
representatives
in
order
that
the
court
might
be
fully
depicted
in
that
journal
i
need
not
recapitulate
my
experiences
on
this
occasion
there
is
an
account
of
our
visit
in
my
father
glances
back
and
i
inserted
many
additional
particulars
in
my
court
of
the
tuileries
i
may
mention
however
that
it
was
at
compiègne
that
i
first
exchanged
a
few
words
with
napoleon
iii
one
day
my
father
being
unwell
the
weather
was
intensely
cold
i
proceeded
to
the
château
we
slept
at
the
hôtel
de
la
cloche
but
had
the
to
the
château
at
virtually
any
time
accompanied
only
by
our
artist
young
montbard
who
was
currently
known
as
apollo
in
the
quartier
latin
where
he
delighted
the
of
the
bal
bullier
by
a
style
of
choregraphy
in
comparison
with
which
the
achievements
subsequently
witnessed
at
the
notorious
moulin
rouge
would
have
sunk
into
insignificance
montbard
had
to
make
a
couple
of
drawings
on
the
day
i
have
mentioned
and
it
so
happened
that
whilst
we
were
going
about
with
de
la
ferrière
the
chamberlain
on
duty
napoleon
iii
suddenly
appeared
before
us
directly
i
was
presented
to
him
he
spoke
to
me
in
english
telling
me
that
he
often
saw
the
london
and
that
the
illustrations
of
french
life
and
paris
improvements
in
which
he
took
so
keen
an
interest
were
very
ably
executed
he
asked
me
also
how
long
i
had
been
in
france
and
where
i
had
learnt
the
language
then
remarking
that
it
was
near
the
hour
he
told
de
la
ferrière
to
see
that
montbard
and
myself
were
suitably
entertained
i
do
not
think
that
i
had
any
particular
political
opinions
at
that
time
montbard
however
was
a
republican
in
fact
a
future
communard
and
i
know
that
he
did
not
appreciate
his
virtually
enforced
introduction
to
the
badinguet
still
he
contrived
to
be
fairly
polite
and
allowed
the
emperor
to
inspect
the
sketch
he
was
making
there
was
to
be
a
theatrical
performance
at
the
château
that
evening
and
it
had
already
been
arranged
that
montbard
should
witness
it
on
hearing
however
that
it
had
been
impossible
to
provide
my
father
and
myself
with
seats
on
account
of
the
great
demand
for
admission
on
the
part
of
local
magnates
and
the
officers
of
the
garrison
the
emperor
was
good
enough
to
say
after
i
had
explained
that
my
father
indisposition
would
prevent
him
from
attending
voyons
vous
pourrez
bien
trouver
une
petite
place
pour
ce
jeune
homme
il
pas
si
grand
et
je
suis
sûr
que
cela
lui
fera
plaisir
de
la
ferrière
bowed
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
i
witnessed
the
performance
after
all
being
seated
on
a

however

refused

years
and
the
outcome
first
of

war
and
secondly
of
the
war
between
prussia
and

in
had
alarmed
many
french
politicians
napoleon
iii
had
expected
some
territorial
compensation
in
return
for
his
neutrality
at
those
periods
and
it
is
certain
that
bismarck
as
chief
prussian
minister
had
allowed
him
to
suppose
that
he
would
be
able
to
indemnify
himself
for
his
in
the
contests
after
attaining
her
ends
however
prussia
turned
an
unwilling
ear
to
the
french
emperor
suggestions
and
from
that
moment
a
war
became
inevitable
although
as
i
well
remember
there
was
a
perfect
rage
for
bismarck
this
and
bismarck
that
in
paris
particularly
for
the
bismarck
colour
a
shade
of
havana
brown
the
prussian
statesman
who
had
so
successfully
jockeyed
the
man
of
destiny
was
undoubtedly
a
well
hated
and
dreaded
individual
among
the
parisians
at
least
among
all
those
who
thought
of
the
future
of
europe
prussian
policy
however
was
not
the
only
cause
of
anxiety
in
france
for
at
the
same
period
the
republican
opposition
to
the
imperial
authority
was
steadily
gaining
strength
in
the
great
cities
and
the
political
concessions
by
which
napoleon
iii
sought
to
disarm
it
only
emboldened
it
to
make
fresh
demands
in
planning
a
war
on
prussia
the
emperor
was
influenced
both
by
national
and
by
dynastic
considerations
the
rise
of
prussia
which
had
become
head
of
the
north
german
confederation
was
without
doubt
a
menace
not
only
to
french
ascendency
on
the
continent
but
also
to
france
general
interests
on
the
other
hand
the
prestige
of
the
empire
having
been
seriously
impaired
in
france
itself
by
the
diplomatic
defeats
which
bismarck
had
inflicted
on
napoleon
it
seemed
that
only
a
successful
war
waged
on
the
power
from
which
france
had
received
those
successive
rebuffs
could
restore
the
aforesaid
prestige
and
ensure
the
duration
of
the
bonaparte
dynasty
even
nowadays
in
spite
of
innumerable
revelations
many
writers
continue
to
cast
all
the
responsibility
of
the
war
on
germany
or
to
be
more
precise
on
prussia
as
represented
by
bismarck
that
however
is
a
great
error
a
trial
of
strength
was
regarded
on
both
sides
as
inevitable
and
both
sides
contributed
to
bring
it
about
bismarck
share
in
the
conflict
was
to
precipitate
hostilities
selecting
for
them
what
he
judged
to
be
an
opportune
moment
for
his
country
and
thereby
preventing
the
emperor
napoleon
from
maturing
his
designs
the
latter
did
not
intend
to
declare
war
until
early
in
the
prussian
statesman
brought
it
about
in
july
the
emperor
really
took
to
the
soon
after
a
great
military
council
was
assembled
and
various
measures
were
devised
to
strengthen
the
army
the
principal
step
was
the
creation
of
a
territorial
force
called
the
garde
mobile
which
was
expected
to
yield
more
than
half
a
million
men
marshal
niel
who
was
then
minister
of
war
attempted
to
carry
out
this
scheme
but
was
hampered
by
an
insufficiency
of
money
nowadays
i
often
think
of
niel
and
the
garde
mobile
when
i
read
of
lord
haldane
colonel
seely
and
our
own
terriers
it
seems
to
me
at
times
as
if
the
clock
had
gone
back
more
than
forty
years
niel
died
in
august
leaving
his
task
in
an
extremely
unfinished
state
and
marshal
le
boeuf
who
succeeded
him
persevered
with
it
in
a
very
way
the
regular
army
however
was
kept
in
fair
condition
though
it
was
never
so
strong
as
it
appeared
to
be
on
paper
there
was
a
system
in
vogue
by
which
a
conscript
of
means
could
avoid
service
by
supplying
a
originally
he
was
expected
to
provide
his
himself
but
ultimately
he
only
had
to
pay
a
sum
of
money
to
the
military
authorities
who
undertook
to
find
a
man
to
take
his
place
unfortunately
in
thousands
of
instances
over
a
term
of
some
years
the
were
never
provided
at
all
i
do
not
suggest
that
the
money
was
absolutely
misappropriated
but
it
was
diverted
to
other
military
purposes
and
in
the
result
there
was
always
a
considerable
shortage
in
the
annual
contingent
the
creature
comforts
of
the
men
were
certainly
well
looked
after
my
particular
chum
at
bonaparte
was
the
son
of
a
and
i
visited
more
than
one
barracks
or
encampment
without
doubt
there
was
always
an
abundance
of
good
sound
food
further
the
men
were
all
military
authorities
are
agreed
i
believe
that
the
chassepot
rifle
invented
in
or
about
was
superior
to
the
dreyse
which
was
in
use
in
the
prussian
army
then
too
there
was
colonel
de
reffye
or
in
a
sense
the
forerunner
of
the
gatling
and
the
maxim
it
was
first
devised
i
think
in
and
according
to
official
statements
some
three
or
four
years
later
there
were
more
than
a
score
of
batteries
with
regard
to
other
ordnance
however
that
of
the
french
was
inferior
to
that
of
the
germans
as
was
conclusively
proved
at
sedan
and
elsewhere
in
many
respects
the
work
of
army
reform
publicly
advised
by
general
trochu
in
a
famous
pamphlet
and
by
other
officers
in
reports
to
the
emperor
and
the
ministry
of
war
proceeded
at
a
very
slow
pace
being
impeded
by
a
variety
of
considerations
the
young
men
of
the
large
towns
did
not
take
kindly
to
the
idea
of
serving
in
the
new
garde
mobile
having
escaped
service
in
the
regular
army
by
drawing
exempting
numbers
or
by
paying
for
they
regarded
it
as
very
unfair
that
they
should
be
called
upon
to
serve
at
all
and
there
were
serious
riots
in
various
parts
of
france
at
the
time
of
their
first
enrolment
in
many
of
them
failed
to
realize
the
necessities
of
the
case
there
was
no
great
wave
of
patriotism
sweeping
through
the
country
the
german
danger
was
not
yet
generally
apparent
further
many
upholders
of
the
imperial
authority
shook
their
heads
in
deprecation
of
this
scheme
of
enrolling
and
arming
so
many
young
men
who
might
suddenly
blossom
into
revolutionaries
and
turn
their
weapons
against
the
powers
of
the
day
there
was
great
unrest
in
paris
in
the
year
of
henri
famous
journal
issue
after
issue
of
that
effusion
was
seized
and
confiscated
and
more
than
once
did
i
see
vigilant
detectives
snatch
copies
from
people
in
the
streets
in
june
we
had
general
elections
accompanied
by
rioting
on
the
boulevards
it
was
then
that
the
white
blouse
legend
arose
it
being
alleged
that
many
of
the
rioters
were
in
the
pay
of
the
prefecture
of
police
and
wore
white
blouses
expressly
in
order
that
they
might
be
known
to
the
and
the
gardes
de
paris
who
were
called
upon
to
quell
the
disturbances
at
first
thought
it
might
seem
ridiculous
that
any
government
should
stir
up
rioting
for
the
mere
sake
of
putting
it
down
but
it
was
generally
held
that
the
authorities
wished
some
disturbances
to
occur
in
order
first
that
the
might
be
frightened
by
the
prospect
of
a
violent
revolution
and
thereby
induced
to
vote
for
government
candidates
at
the
elections
and
secondly
that
some
of
the
many
real
revolutionaries
might
be
led
to
participate
in
the
rioting
in
such
wise
as
to
supply
a
pretext
for
arresting
them
i
was
with
my
mentor
brossard
and
my
brother
edward
one
night
in
june
when
a
omnibus
was
overturned
on
the
boulevard
montmartre
and
two
or
three
newspaper
kiosks
were
added
to
it
by
way
of
forming
a
barricade
the
purpose
of
which
was
by
no
means
clear
the
great
crowd
of
promenaders
seemed
to
regard
the
affair
as
capital
fun
until
the
police
suddenly
came
up
followed
by
some
mounted
men
of
the
garde
de
paris
whereupon
the
laughing
spectators
became
terrified
and
suddenly
fled
for
their
lives
with
my
companions
i
gazed
on
the
scene
from
the
of
the
café
mazarin
it
was
the
first
affair
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
witnessed
and
for
that
reason
impressed
itself
more
vividly
on
my
mind
than
several
subsequent
and
more
serious
ones
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
all
the
little
tables
set
out
in
front
of
the
cafés
were
deserted
and
was
the
sight
of
the
many
women
with
golden
chignons
scurrying
away
with
their
alarmed
companions
and
tripping
now
and
again
over
some
fallen
chair
whilst
the
pursuing
cavalry
clattered
noisily
along
the
a
londoner
might
form
some
idea
of
the
scene
by
picturing
a
charge
from
leicester
square
to
piccadilly
circus
at
the
hour
when
coventry
street
is
most
thronged
with
undesirables
of
both
sexes
the
majority
of
the
white
blouses
and
their
friends
escaped
unhurt
and
the
police
and
the
guards
chiefly
expended
their
vigour
on
the
spectators
of
the
original
disturbance
whether
this
had
been
secretly
engineered
by
the
authorities
for
one
of
the
purposes
i
previously
indicated
must
always
remain
a
moot
point
in
any
case
it
did
not
incline
the
parisians
to
vote
for
the
government
candidates
every
deputy
returned
for
the
city
on
that
occasion
was
an
opponent
of
the
empire
and
in
later
years
i
was
told
by
an
official
that
when
napoleon
became
acquainted
with
the
result
of
the
pollings
he
said
in
reference
to
the
nominees
whom
he
had
favoured
not
one
not
a
single
one
the
ingratitude
of
the
parisians
as
the
emperor
styled
it
was
always
a
thorn
in
his
side
yet
he
should
have
remembered
that
in
the
past
the
bulk
of
the
parisians
had
seldom
if
ever
been
on
the
side
of
constituted
authority
later
that
year
came
the
famous
affair
of
the
pantin
crimes
and
i
was
present
with
my
father
when
troppmann
the
brutish
murderer
of
the
kinck
family
stood
his
trial
at
the
assizes
but
quite
properly
my
father
would
not
let
me
accompany
him
when
he
attended
the
miscreant
execution
outside
the
prison
of
la
roquette
some
years
later
however
i
witnessed
the
execution
of
prévost
on
the
same
spot
and
at
a
subsequent
date
i
attended
both
the
trial
and
the
execution
of
caserio
the
assassin
of
president
carnot
at
lyons
following
troppmann
case
in
the
early
days
of
came
the
crime
of
the
wild
boar
of
corsica
prince
pierre
bonaparte
grandfather
of
the
present
princess
george
of
greece
who
shot
the
young
journalist
victor
noir
when
the
latter
went
with
ulrich
de
fonvielle
aeronaut
as
well
as
journalist
to
call
him
out
on
behalf
of
the
irrepressible
henri
rochefort
i
remember
accompanying
one
of
our
artists
gaildrau
when
a
sketch
was
made
of
the
scene
of
the
crime
the
prince
at
auteuil
a
peculiar
panelled
and
apartment
furnished
in
what
we
should
call
in
england
a
tawdry
style
on
the
occasion
of
noir
funeral
my
father
and
myself
were
in
the
champs
elysées
when
the
tumultuous
revolutionary
procession
in
which
rochefort
figured
conspicuously
swept
down
the
famous
avenue
along
which
the
victorious
germans
were
to
march
little
more
than
a
year
afterwards
near
the
the
was
broken
up
and
scattered
by
the
police
whose
violence
was
extreme
rochefort
brave
enough
on
the
fainted
away
and
was
carried
off
in
a
vehicle
his
position
as
a
member
of
the
legislative
body
momentarily
rendering
him
immune
from
arrest
within
a
month
however
he
was
under
lock
and
key
and
some
fierce
rioting
ensued
in
the
north
of
paris
during
the
spring
my
father
went
to
ireland
as
special
commissioner
of
the
london
and
the
mall
in
order
to
investigate
the
condition
of
the
tenantry
and
the
agrarian
crimes
which
were
then
so
prevalent
there
meantime
i
was
left
in
paris
virtually
on
my
own
though
i
was
often
with
my
elder
brother
edward
about
this
time
moreover
a
friend
of
my
father
began
to
take
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
me
this
was
captain
the
hon
dennis
bingham
a
member
of
the
clanmorris
family
and
the
regular
correspondent
of
the
mall
in
paris
he
subsequently
became
known
as
the
author
of
various
works
on
the
bonapartes
and
the
bourbons
and
of
a
volume
of
recollections
of
paris
life
in
which
i
am
once
or
twice
mentioned
bingham
was
married
to
a
very
charming
lady
of
the
laoretelle
family
which
gave
a
couple
of
historians
to
france
and
i
was
always
received
most
kindly
at
their
home
near
the
arc
de
triomphe
moreover
bingham
often
took
me
about
with
him
in
my
spare
time
and
introduced
me
to
several
prominent
people
later
during
the
street
fighting
at
the
close
of
the
commune
in
we
had
some
dramatic
adventures
together
and
on
one
occasion
bingham
saved
my
life
the
earlier
months
of
went
by
very
swiftly
amidst
a
multiplicity
of
interesting
events
emile
ollivier
had
now
become
chief
minister
and
an
era
of
liberal
reforms
appeared
to
have
begun
it
seemed
moreover
as
if
the
minister
charming
wife
were
for
her
part
intent
on
reforming
the
practices
of
her
sex
in
regard
to
dress
for
she
resolutely
set
her
face
against
the
extravagant
toilettes
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
repeatedly
appearing
at
the
tuileries
in
the
most
unassuming
attire
which
however
by
sheer
force
of
contrast
rendered
her
very
conspicuous
there
the
patronesses
of
the
great
were
quite
irate
at
receiving
such
a
lesson
from
a
but
all
who
shared
the
views
expressed
by
president
dupin
a
few
years
previously
respecting
the
unbridled
luxury
of
women
were
naturally
delighted
her
husband
attempts
at
political
reform
were
certainly
well
meant
but
the
republicans
regarded
him
as
a
renegade
and
the
older
imperialists
as
an
intruder
and
nothing
that
he
did
gave
satisfaction
the
concession
of
the
right
of
public
meeting
led
to
frequent
disorders
at
belleville
and
montmartre
and
the
increased
freedom
of
the
press
only
acted
as
an
incentive
to
violence
of
language
nevertheless
when
there
came
a
plebiscitum
the
last
of
the
reign
to
ascertain
the
country
opinion
respecting
the
reforms
devised
by
the
emperor
and
ollivier
a
huge
majority
signified
approval
of
them
and
thus
the
liberal
empire
seemed
to
be
firmly
established
if
however
the
nation
at
large
had
known
what
was
going
on
behind
the
scenes
both
in
diplomatic
and
in
military
spheres
the
result
of
the
plebiscitum
would
probably
have
been
very
different
already
on
the
morrow
of
the
war
between
prussia
and
austria
the
emperor
as
i
previously
indicated
had
begun
to
devise
a
plan
of
campaign
in
regard
to
the
former
power
taking
as
his
particular
in
the
matter
general
lebrun
his
and
general
frossard
the
governor
of
the
young
imperial
prince
marshal
niel
as
war
minister
was
cognizant
of
the
emperor
conferences
with
lebrun
and
frossard
but
does
not
appear
to
have
taken
any
direct
part
in
the
plans
which
were
devised
they
were
originally
purely
defensive
plans
intended
to
provide
for
any
invasion
of
french
territory
from
across
the
rhine
colonel
baron
stoffel
the
french
military
at
berlin
had
frequently
warned
the
war
office
in
paris
respecting
the
possibility
of
a
prussian
attack
and
the
strength
of
the
prussian
armaments
which
he
wrote
would
enable
king
william
with
the
assistance
of
the
other
german
rulers
to
throw
a
force
of
nearly
a
million
men
into
further
general
ducrot
who
commanded
the
garrison
at
strasburg
became
acquainted
with
many
things
which
he
communicated
to
his
relative
baron
de
bourgoing
one
of
the
emperor
equerries
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
various
communications
reached
napoleon
iii
and
though
he
may
have
regarded
both
the
statements
of
stoffel
and
those
of
ducrot
as
exaggerated
he
was
certainly
sufficiently
impressed
by
them
to
order
the
preparation
of
certain
plans
frossard
basing
himself
on
the
operations
of
the
austrians
in
december
and
keeping
in
mind
the
methods
by
which
hoche
with
the
moselle
army
and
pichegru
with
the
rhine
army
forced
them
back
from
the
french
frontier
drafted
a
scheme
of
defence
in
which
he
foresaw
the
battle
of
wörth
but
through
following
erroneous
information
greatly
miscalculated
the
probable
number
of
combatants
he
set
forth
in
his
scheme
that
the
imperial
government
could
not
possibly
allow
and
champagne
to
be
invaded
without
a
trial
of
strength
at
the
very
outset
and
marshal
bazaine
who
at
some
period
or
other
annotated
a
copy
of
frossard
scheme
signified
his
approval
of
that
dictum
but
added
significantly
that
good
tactical
measures
should
be
adopted
he
himself
demurred
to
frossard
plans
saying
that
he
was
no
partisan
of
a
frontal
defence
but
believed
in
falling
on
the
enemy
flanks
and
rear
yet
as
we
know
macmahon
fought
the
battle
of
wörth
under
conditions
in
many
respects
similar
to
those
which
frossard
had
foreseen
however
the
purely
defensive
plans
on
which
napoleon
iii
at
first
worked
were
replaced
in
by
offensive
ones
in
which
general
lebrun
took
a
prominent
part
both
from
the
military
and
from
the
diplomatic
standpoints
it
was
not
however
until
march
that
the
archduke
albert
of
austria
came
to
paris
to
confer
with
the
french
emperor
lebrun
plan
of
campaign
was
discussed
by
them
and
marshal
le
boeuf
and
generals
frossard
and
jarras
were
privy
to
the
negotiations
it
was
proposed
that
france
austria
and
italy
should
invade
germany
conjointly
and
according
to
le
boeuf
the
power
could
place
men
on
the
frontier
in
a
fortnight
time
both
austria
and
italy
however
required
days
to
mobilize
their
forces
though
the
former
offered
to
provide
two
army
corps
during
the
interval
when
lebrun
subsequently
went
to
vienna
to
come
to
a
positive
decision
and
arrange
details
the
archduke
albert
pointed
out
that
the
war
ought
to
begin
in
the
spring
season
for
said
he
the
north
germans
would
be
able
to
support
the
cold
and
dampness
of
a
winter
campaign
far
better
than
the
allies
that
was
an
absolutely
correct
forecast
fully
confirmed
by
all
that
took
place
in
france
during
the
winter
of
but
prussia
heard
of
what
was
brewing
austria
was
betrayed
to
her
by
hungary
and
italy
and
france
could
not
come
to
an
understanding
on
the
question
of
rome
at
the
outset
prince
napoleon
jérome
was
concerned
in
the
latter
negotiations
which
were
eventually
conducted
by
count
vimercati
the
italian
military
in
paris
napoleon
however
steadily
refused
to
withdraw
his
forces
from
the
states
of
the
church
and
to
allow
victor
emmanuel
to
occupy
rome
had
he
yielded
on
those
points
italy
would
certainly
have
joined
him
and
austria
however
much
hungarian
statesmen
might
have
disliked
it
would
in
all
probability
have
followed
suit
by
the
policy
he
pursued
in
this
matter
the
french
emperor
lost
everything
and
prevented
nothing
on
the
one
hand
france
was
defeated
and
the
empire
of
the
bonapartes
collapsed
whilst
on
the
other
rome
became
italy
true
capital
bismarck
was
in
no
way
inclined
to
allow
the
negotiations
for
an
alliance
to
mature
they
dragged
on
for
a
considerable
time
but
the
government
of
napoleon
iii
was
not
particularly
disturbed
thereat
as
it
felt
certain
that
victory
would
attend
the
french
arms
at
the
outset
and
that
italy
and
austria
would
eventually
give
support
bismarck
however
precipitated
events
already
in
the
previous
year
prince
leopold
of
had
been
a
candidate
for
the
throne
of
spain
that
candidature
had
been
withdrawn
in
order
to
avert
a
conflict
between
france
and
germany
but
now
it
was
revived
at
instigation
in
order
to
bring
about
one
i
have
said
i
think
enough
to
show
in
fairness
to
germany
that
the
war
of
was
not
an
unprovoked
attack
on
france
the
incidents
such
as
the
ems
affair
which
directly
led
up
to
it
were
after
all
only
of
secondary
importance
although
they
bulked
so
largely
at
the
time
of
their
occurrence
i
well
remember
the
great
excitement
which
prevailed
in
paris
during
the
few
anxious
days
when
to
the
man
in
the
street
the
question
of
peace
or
war
seemed
to
be
trembling
in
the
balance
though
in
reality
that
question
was
already
virtually
decided
upon
both
sides
judging
by
all
that
has
been
revealed
to
us
during
the
last
forty
years
i
do
not
think
that
emile
ollivier
the
prime
minister
would
have
been
able
to
modify
the
decision
of
the
fateful
council
held
at
saint
cloud
even
if
he
had
attended
it
possessed
by
many
delusions
the
bulk
of
the
imperial
councillors
were
too
confident
of
success
to
draw
back
and
besides
bismarck
and
moltke
were
not
disposed
to
let
france
draw
back
they
were
ready
and
they
knew
right
well
that
opportunity
is
a
fine
thing
it
was
on
july
that
the
duc
de
gramont
the
imperial
minister
of
foreign
affairs
read
his
memorable
statement
to
the
legislative
body
and
two
days
later
a
formal
declaration
of
war
was
signed
paris
at
once
became
delirious
with
enthusiasm
though
as
we
know
by
all
the
telegrams
from
the
prefects
of
the
departments
the
provinces
generally
desired
that
peace
might
be
preserved
resident
in
paris
and
knowing
at
that
time
very
little
about
the
rest
of
france
for
i
had
merely
stayed
during
my
summer
holidays
at
such
seaside
resorts
as
trouville
deauville
beuzeval
malo
and
servan
i
undoubtedly
caught
the
parisian
fever
and
i
dare
say
that
i
sometimes
joined
in
the
universal
chorus
of
à
berlin
mere
lad
as
i
was
in
spite
of
my
precocity
i
shared
also
the
universal
confidence
in
the
french
army
in
that
confidence
many
english
military
men
participated
only
those
who
like
captain
hozier
of
had
closely
watched
prussian
methods
during
the
seven
weeks
war
in
clearly
realized
that
the
north
german
kingdom
possessed
a
thoroughly
well
organized
fighting
machine
led
by
officers
of
the
greatest
ability
and
capable
of
effecting
something
like
a
revolution
in
the
art
of
war
france
was
currently
thought
stronger
than
she
really
was
of
the
good
physique
of
her
men
there
could
be
no
doubt
everybody
who
witnessed
the
great
military
pageants
of
those
times
was
impressed
by
the
bearing
of
the
troops
and
their
efficiency
under
arms
and
nobody
anticipated
that
they
would
be
so
inferior
to
the
germans
in
numbers
as
proved
to
be
the
case
and
that
the
generals
would
show
themselves
so
inferior
in
mental
calibre
to
the
commanders
of
the
opposing
forces
the
paris
garrison
it
is
true
was
no
real
criterion
of
the
french
army
generally
though
foreigners
were
apt
to
judge
the
latter
by
what
they
saw
of
it
in
the
capital
the
troops
stationed
there
were
mostly
picked
men
the
garrison
being
very
largely
composed
of
the
imperial
guard
the
latter
always
made
a
brilliant
display
not
merely
by
reason
of
its
somewhat
showy
uniforms
recalling
at
times
those
of
the
first
empire
but
also
by
the
men
fine
and
their
general
military
proficiency
they
certainly
fought
well
in
some
of
the
earlier
battles
of
the
war
their
commander
was
general
bourbaki
a
fine
soldierly
looking
man
the
grandson
of
a
greek
pilot
who
acted
as
intermediary
between
napoleon
i
and
his
brother
joseph
at
the
time
of
the
former
expedition
to
egypt
it
was
this
original
bourbaki
who
carried
to
napoleon
joseph
secret
letters
reporting
josephine
misconduct
in
her
husband
absence
misconduct
which
napoleon
condoned
at
the
time
though
it
would
have
entitled
him
to
a
divorce
nine
years
before
he
decided
on
one
with
the
spectacle
of
the
imperial
guard
constantly
before
their
eyes
the
parisians
of
july
could
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
defeat
and
moreover
at
the
first
moment
it
was
not
believed
that
the
southern
german
states
would
join
north
germany
against
france
napoleon
iii
and
his
confidential
advisers
well
knew
however
what
to
think
on
that
point
and
the
delusions
of
the
man
in
the
street
departed
when
on
july
bavaria
würtemberg
baden
and
announced
their
intention
of
supporting
prussia
and
the
north
german
confederation
still
this
did
not
dismay
the
parisians
and
the
shouts
of
to
berlin
to
berlin
were
as
frequent
as
ever
it
had
long
been
one
of
my
dreams
to
see
and
participate
in
the
great
drama
of
war
all
boys
i
suppose
come
into
the
world
with
pugnacious
instincts
there
must
be
few
too
who
never
play
at
soldiers
my
own
interest
in
warfare
and
soldiering
had
been
steadily
fanned
from
my
earliest
childhood
in
the
first
place
i
had
been
incessantly
confronted
by
all
the
scenes
of
war
depicted
in
the
and
the
london
those
journals
being
posted
to
me
regularly
every
week
whilst
i
was
still
only
a
little
chap
at
eastbourne
further
the
career
of
my
uncle
frank
vizetelly
exercised
a
strange
fascination
over
me
born
in
fleet
street
in
september
he
was
the
youngest
of
my
father
three
brothers
educated
with
gustave
doré
he
became
an
artist
for
the
illustrated
press
and
in
represented
the
as
in
italy
being
a
part
of
the
time
with
the
french
and
at
other
moments
with
the
sardinian
forces
that
was
the
first
of
his
many
campaigns
his
services
being
afterwards
secured
by
the
london
he
next
accompanied
garibaldi
from
palermo
to
naples
then
at
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
in
the
united
states
he
repaired
thither
with
howard
russell
and
on
finding
obstacles
placed
in
his
way
on
the
federal
side
travelled
underground
to
richmond
and
joined
the
confederates
the
late
duke
of
devonshire
the
late
lord
wolseley
and
francis
lawley
were
among
his
successive
companions
at
one
time
he
and
the
shared
the
same
tent
and
lent
socks
and
shirts
to
one
another
now
and
again
however
frank
vizetelly
came
to
england
after
running
the
blockade
stayed
a
few
weeks
in
london
and
then
departed
for
america
once
more
yet
again
running
the
blockade
on
his
way
this
he
did
on
at
least
three
occasions
his
next
campaign
was
the
war
of
when
he
was
with
the
austrian
commander
benedek
for
a
few
years
afterwards
he
remained
in
london
assisting
his
eldest
brother
james
to
run
what
was
probably
the
first
of
the
society
journals
of
the
to
which
mortimer
collins
and
the
late
sir
edmund
monson
largely
contributed
however
frank
vizetelly
went
back
to
america
once
again
this
time
with
wolseley
on
the
red
river
expedition
later
he
was
with
don
carlos
in
spain
and
with
the
french
in
tunis
whence
he
proceeded
to
egypt
he
died
on
the
field
of
duty
meeting
his
death
when
hicks
pasha
little
army
was
annihilated
in
the
denies
of
kashgil
in
the
soudan
now
in
the
earlier
years
when
frank
vizetelly
returned
from
italy
or
america
he
was
often
at
my
father
house
at
kensington
and
i
heard
him
talk
of
napoleon
iii
macmahon
garibaldi
victor
emmanuel
cialdini
robert
lee
longstreet
stonewall
jackson
and
captain
semmes
i
saw
all
the
engravings
prepared
after
his
sketches
and
i
regarded
him
and
them
with
a
kind
of
childish
reverence
i
can
picture
him
still
a
hale
bluff
tall
and
man
with
short
dark
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
big
ruddy
moustache
he
was
far
away
the
best
known
member
of
our
family
in
my
younger
days
when
anonymity
in
journalism
was
an
almost
universal
rule
in
the
same
way
however
as
everybody
had
heard
of
howard
russell
the
war
correspondent
of
the
so
most
people
had
heard
of
frank
vizetelly
the
of
the
he
was
in
the
service
of
the
when
he
was
killed
i
well
remember
being
alternately
amused
and
disgusted
by
a
french
theatrical
delineation
of
an
english
war
correspondent
given
in
a
spectacular
military
piece
which
i
witnessed
a
short
time
after
my
first
arrival
in
paris
it
was
called
the
siege
of
pekin
and
had
been
concocted
by
mocquard
the
emperor
napoleon
secretary
all
the
comic
business
in
the
affair
was
supplied
by
a
war
correspondent
of
the
who
strutted
about
in
a
tropical
helmet
embellished
with
a
green
derby
veil
and
was
provided
with
a
portable
desk
and
a
huge
umbrella
this
and
individual
was
for
ever
talking
of
having
to
do
this
and
that
for
the
first
paper
of
the
first
country
in
the
world
and
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
an
engagement
he
deliberately
planted
himself
between
the
french
and
chinese
combatants
i
should
doubtless
have
derived
more
amusement
from
his
tomfoolery
had
i
not
already
known
that
english
war
correspondents
did
not
behave
in
any
such
idiotic
manner
and
i
came
away
from
the
performance
with
strong
feelings
of
resentment
respecting
so
outrageous
a
caricature
of
a
profession
counting
among
its
members
the
uncle
whom
i
so
much
admired
whatever
my
dreams
may
have
been
i
hardly
anticipated
that
i
should
join
that
profession
myself
during
the
war
the
lycées
broke
up
in
confusion
and
my
father
decided
to
send
me
to
join
my
stepmother
and
the
younger
members
of
the
family
at
saint
servan
it
being
his
intention
to
go
to
the
front
with
my
elder
brother
edward
but
simpson
the
veteran
crimean
war
artist
came
over
to
join
the
army
of
the
rhine
and
my
brother
securing
an
engagement
from
the
york
set
out
on
his
own
account
thus
i
was
promptly
recalled
to
paris
where
my
father
had
decided
to
remain
in
those
days
the
journey
from
brittany
to
the
capital
took
many
long
and
wearisome
hours
and
i
made
it
in
a
carriage
of
a
train
crowded
with
soldiers
of
all
arms
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
most
of
them
were
intoxicated
and
the
grossness
of
their
language
and
manners
was
almost
beyond
belief
that
dreadful
night
spent
on
the
boards
of
a
and
jolting
train
there
were
then
no
cushioned
seats
in
french
carriages
amidst
drunken
and
companions
gave
me
as
it
were
a
glimpse
of
the
other
side
of
the
picture
that
is
of
several
things
which
lie
behind
the
glamour
of
war
it
must
have
been
about
july
when
i
returned
to
paris
a
decree
had
just
been
issued
appointing
the
empress
as
regent
in
the
absence
of
the
emperor
who
was
to
take
command
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
it
had
originally
been
intended
that
there
should
be
three
french
armies
but
during
the
conferences
with
archduke
albert
in
the
spring
that
plan
was
abandoned
in
favour
of
one
sole
army
under
the
command
of
napoleon
iii
the
idea
underlying
the
change
was
to
avoid
a
superfluity
of
and
to
augment
the
number
of
actual
combatants
both
le
boeuf
and
lebrun
approved
of
the
alteration
and
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
there
were
already
misgivings
on
the
french
side
in
regard
to
the
inferior
strength
of
their
effectives
the
army
was
divided
into
eight
sections
that
is
seven
army
corps
and
the
imperial
guard
bourbaki
as
already
mentioned
commanded
the
guard
and
at
the
head
of
the
army
corps
were
macmahon
frossard
bazaine
ladmerault
failly
canrobert
and
félix
douay
both
frossard
and
failly
however
were
at
first
made
subordinate
to
bazaine
the
head
of
the
information
service
was
colonel
lewal
who
rose
to
be
a
general
and
minister
of
war
under
the
republic
and
who
wrote
some
commendable
works
on
tactics
and
immediately
under
him
were
fay
also
subsequently
a
general
and
captain
jung
who
is
best
remembered
perhaps
by
his
inquiries
into
the
mystery
of
the
man
with
the
iron
mask
i
give
those
names
because
however
distinguished
those
three
men
may
have
become
in
later
years
the
french
intelligence
service
at
the
outset
of
the
war
was
without
doubt
extremely
faulty
and
responsible
for
some
of
the
disasters
which
occurred
on
returning
to
paris
one
of
my
first
duties
was
to
go
in
search
of
moulin
the
whom
i
mentioned
in
my
first
chapter
i
found
him
in
his
somewhat
squalid
home
in
the
quartier
mouffetard
surrounded
by
a
tribe
of
children
and
he
immediately
informed
me
that
he
was
one
of
the
agents
appointed
to
attend
the
emperor
on
the
campaign
the
somewhat
lavish
imperial
on
which
zola
so
frequently
dilated
in
the
downfall
had
i
think
already
been
despatched
to
metz
where
the
emperor
proposed
to
fix
his
headquarters
and
the
escort
of
cent
gardes
was
about
to
proceed
thither
moulin
told
me
however
that
he
and
two
of
his
colleagues
were
to
travel
in
the
same
train
as
napoleon
and
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
forward
either
to
paris
or
to
london
as
might
prove
most
convenient
such
sketches
as
he
might
from
time
to
time
contrive
to
make
he
suggested
that
there
should
be
one
of
the
emperor
departure
from
saint
cloud
and
that
in
order
to
avoid
delay
i
should
accompany
him
on
the
occasion
and
take
it
from
him
we
therefore
went
down
together
on
july
promptly
obtained
admittance
to
the
château
where
moulin
took
certain
instructions
and
then
repaired
to
the
in
the
park
whence
the
imperial
train
was
to
start
officers
and
high
officials
nearly
all
in
uniform
were
constantly
going
to
and
fro
between
the
siding
and
the
château
and
presently
the
imperial
party
appeared
the
emperor
being
between
the
empress
and
the
young
imperial
prince
quite
a
crowd
of
dignitaries
followed
i
do
not
recollect
seeing
emile
ollivier
though
he
must
have
been
present
but
i
took
particular
note
of
rouher
the
once
minister
currently
nicknamed
the
and
later
president
of
the
senate
in
spite
of
his
portliness
he
walked
with
a
most
determined
stride
held
his
head
very
erect
and
spoke
in
his
customary
loud
voice
the
emperor
who
wore
the
undress
uniform
of
a
general
looked
very
grave
and
sallow
the
disease
which
eventually
ended
in
his
death
had
already
become
serious
i
have
given
many
particulars
of
it
in
my
two
books
the
court
of
the
tuileries
chatto
and
windus
and
republican
france
holden
and
hardingham
and
only
a
few
days
later
that
is
during
the
saarbrucken
affair
august
he
was
painfully
affected
by
it
nevertheless
he
had
undertaken
to
command
the
army
of
france
the
imperial
prince
then
fourteen
years
of
age
was
also
in
uniform
it
having
been
arranged
that
he
should
accompany
his
father
to
the
front
and
he
seemed
to
be
extremely
animated
and
restless
repeatedly
turning
to
exchange
remarks
with
one
or
another
officer
near
him
the
empress
who
was
very
simply
gowned
smiled
once
or
twice
in
response
to
some
words
which
fell
from
her
husband
but
for
the
most
part
she
looked
as
serious
as
he
did
whatever
emile
ollivier
may
have
said
about
beginning
this
war
with
a
light
heart
it
is
certain
that
these
two
sovereigns
of
france
realized
at
that
hour
of
parting
the
magnitude
of
the
issues
at
stake
after
they
had
exchanged
a
farewell
kiss
the
empress
took
her
eager
young
son
in
her
arms
and
embraced
him
fondly
and
when
we
next
saw
her
face
we
could
perceive
the
tears
standing
in
her
eyes
the
emperor
was
already
taking
his
seat
and
the
boy
speedily
sprang
after
him
did
the
empress
at
that
moment
wonder
when
where
and
how
she
would
next
see
them
again
perchance
she
did
everything
however
was
speedily
in
readiness
for
departure
as
the
train
began
to
move
both
the
emperor
and
the
prince
waved
their
hands
from
the
windows
whilst
all
the
enthusiastic
imperial
dignitaries
flourished
their
hats
and
raised
a
prolonged
cry
of
vive
it
was
not
perhaps
so
loud
as
it
might
have
been
but
then
they
were
mostly
elderly
men
moulin
during
the
interval
had
contrived
to
make
something
in
the
nature
of
a
sketch
i
had
also
taken
a
few
notes
myself
and
thus
provided

the

it
was
i
think
two
days
after
the
emperor
arrival
at
metz
that
the
first
germans
a
detachment
of
badeners
entered
french
territory
then
on
the
second
of
august
came
the
successful
french
attack
on
saarbrucken
a
petty
affair
but
a
one
as
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
the
young
imperial
prince
received
the
baptism
of
fire
appropriately
enough
the
troops
whose
success
he
witnessed
were
commanded
by
his
late
governor
general
frossard
more
important
was
the
engagement
at
weissenburg
two
days
later
when
a
division
of
the
french
under
general
abel
douay
was
surprised
by
much
superior
forces
and
utterly
overwhelmed
douay
himself
being
killed
during

yet
another
two
days
elapsed
and
then
the

the

frederick
routed

at

of
a
vigorous
resistance
carried
on
the
part
of
the
french
cuirassiers
under
general
the
vicomte
de

to
the
point
of
heroism
in
later
days
the
general
son
married
a
handsome
and
wealthy
young
lady
of
the
bourgeoisie
named
marguerite
crouzet
whom
however
he
had
to
divorce
and
who
afterwards
became
notorious
as
the
mistress
of
general
boulanger
curiously
enough
on
the
very
day
of
the
disaster
of
wörth
a
rumour
of
a
great
french
victory
spread
through
paris
my
father
had
occasion
to
send
me
to
his
bankers
in
the
rue
vivienne
and
on
making
my
way
to
the
boulevards
which
i
proposed
to
follow
i
was
amazed
to
see
the
shopkeepers
eagerly
setting
up
the
tricolour
flags
which
they
habitually
displayed
on
the
emperor
august
nobody
knew
exactly
how
the
rumours
of
victory
had
originated
nobody
could
give
any
precise
details
respecting
the
alleged
great
success
but
everybody
believed
in
it
and
the
enthusiasm
was
universal
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
day
when
i
repaired
to
the
rue
vivienne
and
after
transacting
my
business
there
i
turned
into
the
place
de
la
bourse
where
a
huge
crowd
was
assembled
the
steps
of
the
exchange
were
also
covered
with
people
and
amidst
a
myriad
eager
gesticulations
a
perfect
babel
of
voices
was
ascending
to
the
blue
sky
one
of
the
green
omnibuses
which
in
those
days
ran
from
the
bourse
to
passy
was
waiting
on
the
square
unable
to
depart
owing
to
the
density
of
the
crowd
and
all
at
once
amidst
a
scene
of
great
excitement
and
repeated
shouts
of
la
marseillaise
la
marseillaise
three
or
four
men
climbed
on
to
the
vehicle
and
turning
towards
the
mob
of
speculators
and
sightseers
covering
the
steps
of
the
bourse
they
called
to
them
repeatedly
silence
silence
the
hubbub
slightly
subsided
and
thereupon
one
of
the
party
on
the
omnibus
a
slim
young
fellow
with
a
little
moustache
took
off
his
hat
raised
his
right
arm
and
began
to
sing
the
of
the
revolution
the
stanza
finished
the
whole
assembly
took
up
the
refrain
since
the
days
of
the
coup
the
marseillaise
had
been
banned
in
france
the
official
imperial
air
being
partant
pour
la
syrie
a
military
march
composed
by
the
emperor
mother
queen
hortense
with
words
by
count
alexandre
de
laborde
who
therein
pictured
a
handsome
young
knight
praying
to
the
blessed
virgin
before
his
departure
for
palestine
and
soliciting
of
her
benevolence
that
he
might
prove
to
be
the
bravest
brave
and
love
the
fairest
fair
during
the
twenty
years
of
the
third
napoleon
rule
paris
had
heard
the
strains
of
partant
pour
la
syrie
many
thousand
times
and
though
they
were
tuneful
enough
had
become
thoroughly
tired
of
them
to
stimulate
popular
enthusiasm
in
the
war
the
ollivier
cabinet
had
accordingly
authorized
the
playing
and
singing
of
the
marseillaise
which
although
it
was
by
the
survivors
of
and
was
hummed
even
by
the
young
republicans
of
belleville
and
the
quartier
latin
proved
quite
a
novelty
to
half
the
population
who
were
destined
to
hear
it
again
and
again
and
again
from
that
period
until
the
present
time
the
young
vocalist
who
sang
it
from
the
top
of
a
omnibus
on
that
fateful
day
of
wörth
claimed
to
be
a
tenor
but
was
more
correctly
a
tenorino
his
voice
possessing
far
more
sweetness
than
power
he
was
already
and
popular
for
he
had
taken
the
part
of
romeo
in
gounod
opera
based
on
the
shakespearean
play
like
many
another
singer
victor
capoul
might
have
become
forgotten
before
very
long
but
a
curious
circumstance
having
nothing
to
do
with
vocalism
diffused
and
perpetuated
his
name
he
adopted
a
particular
way
of
dressing
his
hair
plastering
a
part
of
it
down
in
a
kind
of
over
the
forehead
and
the
new
style
catching
on
among
young
parisians
the
coiffure
capoul
eventually
went
round
the
world
it
is
exemplified
in
certain
portraits
of
king
george
in
those
capoul
sang
the
marseillaise
either
at
the
opéra
comique
or
the
théâtre
lyrique
but
at
the
opera
it
was
sung
by
marie
sass
then
at
the
height
of
her
reputation
i
came
in
touch
with
her
a
few
years
later
when
she
was
living
in
the
paris
suburbs
and
more
than
once
when
we
both
travelled
to
the
city
in
the
same
train
i
had
the
honour
of
assisting
her
to
alight
from
it
this
being
no
very
easy
matter
as
la
sass
was
the
very
fattest
and
heaviest
of
all
the
that
i
have
ever
seen
on
the
same
day
that
macmahon
was
defeated
at
wörth
frossard
was
badly
beaten
at
forbach
an
engagement
witnessed
by
my
elder
brother
edward
born
january
and
therefore
in
in
his
year
who
as
i
previously
mentioned
had
gone
to
the
front
for
an
american
journal
finding
it
impossible
to
telegraph
the
news
of
this
serious
french
reverse
he
contrived
to
make
his
way
to
paris
on
a
engine
and
arrived
at
our
flat
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
looking
as
black
as
any
when
he
had
handed
his
account
of
the
affair
to
ryan
the
paris
representative
of
the
york
it
was
suggested
that
his
information
might
perhaps
be
useful
to
the
french
minister
of
war
so
he
hastened
to
the
ministry
where
the
news
he
brought
put
a
finishing
touch
to
the
dismay
of
the
officials
who
were
already
staggering
under
the
first
news
of
the
disaster
of
wörth
paris
jubilant
over
an
imaginary
victory
was
enraged
by
the
tidings
of
wörth
and
forbach
already
dreading
some
revolutionary
enterprise
the
government
declared
the
city
to
be
in
a
state
of
siege
thereby
placing
it
under
military
authority
although
additional
men
had
recently
been
enrolled
in
the
national
guard
the
arming
of
them
had
been
intentionally
delayed
precisely
from
a
fear
of
revolutionary
troubles
which
the
of
the
at
saint
cloud
feared
from
the
very
moment
of
the
first
defeats
i
recollect
witnessing
on
the
place
venddme
one
day
early
in
august
a
very
tumultuous
gathering
of
national
guards
who
had
flocked
thither
in
order
to
demand
weapons
of
the
prime
minister
that
is
emile
ollivier
who
in
addition
to
the
premiership
otherwise
the
presidency
of
the
council
held
the
offices
of
keeper
of
the
seals
and
minister
of
justice
this
department
then
having
its
offices
in
one
of
the
buildings
of
the
place
vendôme
ollivier
responded
to
the
demonstration
by
appearing
on
the
balcony
of
his
private
room
and
delivering
a
brief
speech
which
embraced
a
vague
promise
to
comply
with
the
popular
demand
in
point
of
fact
however
nothing
of
the
kind
was
done
during
his
term
of
office
whilst
writing
these
lines
i
hear
that
this
statesman
has
just
passed
away
at
saint
in
upper
savoy
august
born
at
marseilles
in
july
he
lived
to
complete
his
year
his
second
wife
née
gravier
to
whom
i
referred
in
a
previous
chapter
survives
him
i
do
not
wish
to
be
unduly
hard
on
his
memory
he
came
however
of
a
very
republican
family
and
in
his
earlier
years
he
personally
evinced
what
seemed
to
be
most
staunch
republicanism
when
he
was
first
elected
as
a
member
of
the
legislative
body
in
he
publicly
declared
that
he
would
appear
before
that
essentially
bonapartist
assembly
as
one
of
the
spectres
of
the
crime
of
the
coup
but
subsequently
de
morny
baited
him
with
a
lucrative
appointment
connected
with
the
suez
canal
later
still
the
empress
smiled
on
him
and
finally
he
took
office
under
the
emperor
thereby
disgusting
nearly
every
one
of
his
former
friends
and
associates
i
believe
however
that
ollivier
was
sincerely
convinced
of
the
possibility
of
firmly
establishing
a
but
although
various
reforms
were
carried
out
under
his
auspices
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
was
not
allowed
a
perfectly
free
hand
nor
was
he
fully
taken
into
confidence
with
respect
to
the
emperor
secret
diplomatic
and
military
policy
that
was
proved
by
the
very
speech
in
which
he
spoke
of
entering
upon
the
war
with
prussia
with
a
light
heart
for
in
his
very
next
sentences
he
spoke
of
that
war
as
being
absolutely
forced
upon
france
and
of
himself
and
his
colleagues
as
having
done
all
that
was
humanly
and
honourably
possible
to
avoid
it
assuredly
he
would
not
have
spoken
quite
as
he
did
had
he
realized
at
the
time
that
bismarck
had
merely
forced
on
the
war
in
order
to
defeat
the
emperor
intention
to
invade
germany
in
the
ensuing
spring
the
public
provocation
on
prussia
part
was
as
i
previously
showed
merely
her
reply
to
the
secret
provocation
offered
by
france
as
evidenced
by
all
the
negotiations
with
archduke
albert
on
behalf
of
austria
and
with
count
vimercati
on
behalf
of
italy
on
all
those
matters
ollivier
was
at
the
utmost
but
very
imperfectly
informed
finally
be
it
remembered
that
he
was
absent
from
the
council
at
saint
cloud
at
which
war
was
finally
decided
upon
at
a
very
early
hour
on
the
morning
of
sunday
august
the
day
following
wörth
and
forbach
the
empress
eugénie
came
in
all
haste
and
sore
distress
from
saint
cloud
to
the
tuileries
the
position
was
very
serious
and
anxious
conferences
were
held
by
the
ministers
when
the
legislative
body
met
on
the
morrow
a
number
of
deputies
roundly
denounced
the
manner
in
which
the
military
operations
were
being
conducted
one
deputy
a
certain
who
was
well
known
for
the
outspokenness
of
his
language
horrified
the
more
devoted
imperialists
by
describing
the
french
forces
as
an
army
of
lions
led
by
jackasses
on
the
following
day
ollivier
and
his
colleagues
resigned
office
their
position
had
become
untenable
though
little
if
any
responsibility
attached
to
them
respecting
the
military
operations
the
minister
of
war
general
dejean
had
been
merely
a
appointed
to
carry
out
the
measures
agreed
upon
before
his
predecessor
marshal
le
boeuf
had
gone
to
the
front
as
major
general
of
the
army
it
was
felt
however
among
the
empress
that
the
new
prime
minister
ought
to
be
a
military
man
of
energy
devoted
moreover
to
the
imperial
as
the
marshals
and
most
of
the
conspicuous
generals
of
the
time
were
already
serving
in
the
field
it
was
difficult
to
find
any
prominent
individual
possessed
of
the
desired
qualifications
finally
however
the
empress
was
prevailed
upon
to
telegraph
to
an
officer
whom
she
personally
disliked
this
being
general
comte
de
palikao
he
was
certainly
and
with
good
reason
devoted
to
the
empire
and
in
the
past
he
had
undoubtedly
proved
himself
to
be
a
man
of
energy
but
he
was
at
this
date
in
his
year
a
fact
often
overlooked
by
historians
of
the
war
and
for
that
very
reason
although
he
had
solicited
a
command
in
the
field
at
the
first
outbreak
of
hostilities
it
had
been
decided
to
decline
his
application
and
to
leave
him
at
lyons
where
he
had
commanded
the
garrison
for
five
years
past
thirty
years
of
palikao
life
had
been
spent
in
algeria
contending
during
most
of
that
time
against
the
arabs
but
in
he
had
been
appointed
commander
of
the
french
expedition
to
china
where
with
a
small
force
he
had
conducted
hostilities
with
the
greatest
vigour
repeatedly
decimating
or
scattering
the
hordes
of
chinamen
who
were
opposed
to
him
and
in
conjunction
with
the
english
victoriously
taking
pekin
a
kind
of
stain
rested
on
the
expedition
by
reason
of
the
looting
of
the
chinese
emperor
but
the
entire
responsibility
of
that
affair
could
not
be
cast
on
the
french
commander
as
he
only
continued
and
completed
what
the
english
began
on
his
return
to
france
napoleon
iii
created
him
comte
de
palikao
the
name
being
taken
from
one
of
his
chinese
victories
and
in
addition
wished
the
legislative
body
to
grant
him
a
however
the
looting
scandal
prevented
this
much
to
the
emperor
annoyance
and
subsequent
to
the
fall
of
the
empire
it
was
discovered
that
by
napoleon
express
orders
the
war
ministry
had
paid
palikao
a
sum
of
about
diverting
that
amount
of
money
in
accordance
with
the
practices
of
the
time
from
the
purpose
originally
assigned
to
it
in
the
estimates
this
was
not
generally
known
when
palikao
became
chief
minister
he
was
then
what
might
be
called
a
very
well
preserved
old
officer
but
his
lungs
had
been
somewhat
affected
by
a
of
long
standing
and
this
he
more
than
once
gave
as
a
reason
for
replying
with
the
greatest
brevity
to
interpellations
in
the
chamber
moreover
as
matters
went
from
bad
to
worse
this
same
lung
trouble
became
a
good
excuse
for
preserving
absolute
silence
on
certain
inconvenient
occasions
when
however
palikao
was
willing
to
speak
he
often
did
so
untruthfully
repeatedly
adding
the
to
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
like
other
fervent
partisans
of
the
dynasty
was
afraid
to
let
the
parisians
know
the
true
state
of
affairs
besides
he
himself
was
often
ignorant
of
it
he
took
office
he
was
the
third
war
minister
in
fifty
days
without
any
knowledge
whatever
of
the
imperial
plan
of
campaign
or
the
steps
to
be
adopted
in
the
event
of
further
french
reverses
and
a
herculean
task
lay
before
this
septuagenarian
officer
who
by
experience
knew
right
well
how
to
deal
with
arabs
and
chinamen
but
had
never
had
to
contend
with
european
troops
nevertheless
he
displayed
zeal
and
activity
in
his
new
and
position
he
greatly
assisted
macmahon
to
reconstitute
his
army
at
châlons
he
planned
the
organization
of
three
more
army
corps
and
he
started
on
the
work
of
placing
paris
in
a
state
of
defence
whilst
his
colleague
clément
duvernois
the
new
minister
of
commerce
began
gathering
flocks
and
herds
together
in
order
that
the
city
if
besieged
might
have
the
necessary
means
of
subsistence
at
this
time
there
were
quite
a
number
of
english
war
as
well
as
own
correspondents
in
paris
the
former
had
mostly
returned
from
metz
whither
they
had
repaired
at
the
time
of
the
emperor
departure
for
the
front
at
the
outset
it
had
seemed
as
though
the
french
would
allow
foreign
journalists
to
accompany
them
on
their
promenade
to
berlin
but
on
reverses
setting
in
all
official
recognition
was
denied
to
newspaper
men
and
moreover
some
of
the
representatives
of
the
london
press
had
a
very
unpleasant
time
at
metz
being
arrested
there
as
spies
and
subjected
to
divers
indignities
i
do
not
remember
whether
they
were
ordered
back
to
paris
or
whether
they
voluntarily
withdrew
to
the
capital
on
their
position
with
the
army
becoming
untenable
but
in
any
case
they
arrived
in
the
city
and
lingered
there
for
a
time
holding
daily
symposiums
at
the
grand
café
at
the
corner
of
the
ruè
scribe
on
the
boulevards
from
time
to
time
i
went
there
with
my
father
and
amongst
this
galaxy
of
journalistic
talent
i
met
certain
men
with
whom
i
had
spoken
in
my
childhood
one
of
them
for
instance
was
george
augustus
sala
and
another
was
henry
mayhew
the
famous
author
of
london
labour
and
the
london
poor
he
being
accompanied
by
his
son
athol
looking
back
it
seems
to
me
that
in
spite
of
all
their
brilliant
gifts
neither
sala
nor
henry
mayhew
was
fitted
to
be
a
correspondent
in
the
field
and
they
were
certainly
much
better
placed
in
paris
than
at
the
headquarters
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
among
the
resident
correspondents
who
attended
the
gatherings
at
the
grand
café
were
captain
bingham
blanchard
son
of
douglas
jerrold
and
the
jaunty
bower
who
had
once
been
tried
for
his
life
and
acquitted
by
virtue
of
the
unwritten
law
in
connection
with
an
in
which
he
was
the
aggrieved
party
for
more
than
forty
years
past
whenever
i
have
seen
a
bluff
looking
elderly
gentleman
sporting
a
and
a
blue
necktie
i
have
instinctively
thought
of
bower
who
wore
such
a
waistcoat
and
such
a
necktie
with
the
glossiest
of
silk
hats
and
most
shapely
of
boots
throughout
the
siege
of
paris
when
he
was
fond
of
dilating
on
the
merits
of
boiled
ostrich
and
stewed
elephant
foot
of
which
expensive
dainties
he
partook
at
his
club
after
the
inmates
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
had
been
slaughtered
bower
represented
the
i
do
not
remember
seeing
bowes
of
the
at
the
gatherings
i
have
referred
to
or
crawford
of
the
who
so
long
wrote
his
paris
letters
at
a
little
café
fronting
the
bourse
but
it
was
certainly
at
the
grand
café
that
i
first
set
eyes
on
labouchere
who
like
sala
was
installed
at
the
neighbouring
grand
hotel
and
was
soon
to
become
famous
as
the
besieged
resident
as
for
thomas
gibson
bowles
who
represented
the
during
the
german
siege
i
first
set
eyes
on
him
at
the
british
embassy
when
he
had
a
beautiful
little
moustache
which
i
greatly
envied
and
wore
his
hair
nicely
parted
down
the
middle
fugaces
labuntur
sala
was
the
life
and
soul
of
those
gatherings
at
the
grand
café
always
exuberantly
gay
unless
indeed
the
conversation
turned
on
the
prospects
of
the
french
forces
when
he
railed
at
them
without
ceasing
blanchard
jerrold
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
spy
system
of
the
empire
repeatedly
warned
sala
to
be
cautious
but
in
vain
and
the
eventual
result
of
his
outspokenness
was
a
very
unpleasant
adventure
on
the
eve
of
the
empire
fall
in
the
presence
of
all
those
distinguished
men
of
the
pen
i
myself
mostly
preserved
as
befitted
my
age
a
very
discreet
silence
listening
intently
but
seldom
opening
my
lips
unless
it
were
to
accept
or
refuse
another
cup
of
coffee
or
some
de
or
i
never
touched
any
intoxicant
excepting
claret
at
my
meals
and
though
in
my
eastbourne
days
i
had
like
most
boys
of
my
time
experimented
with
a
clay
pipe
and
some
dark
shag
i
did
not
smoke
my
father
personally
was
extremely
fond
of
cigars
but
had
he
caught
me
smoking
one
he
would
i
believe
have
knocked
me
down
in
connection
with
those
grand
café
gatherings
i
one
day
had
a
little
adventure
it
had
been
arranged
that
i
should
meet
my
father
there
and
turning
into
the
boulevards
from
the
madeleine
i
went
slowly
past
what
was
then
called
the
rue
basse
du
rempart
i
was
thinking
of
something
or
other
i
do
not
remember
what
but
in
any
case
i
was
absorbed
in
thought
and
inadvertently
i
dogged
the
footsteps
of
two
gentlemen
who
were
deep
in
conversation
i
was
almost
unconscious
of
their
presence
and
in
any
case
i
did
not
hear
a
word
of
what
they
were
saying
but
all
at
once
one
of
them
turned
round
and
said
to
me
angrily
bien
aller
petit
espion
otherwise
be
off
little
spy
i
woke
up
as
it
were
looked
at
him
and
to
my
amazement
recognized
gambetta
whom
i
had
seen
several
times
already
when
i
was
with
my
mentor
brossard
at
either
the
café
de
suède
or
the
café
de
madrid
at
the
same
time
however
his
companion
also
turned
round
and
proved
to
be
jules
simon
who
knew
me
through
a
son
of
his
this
was
fortunate
for
he
immediately
exclaimed
why
no
it
is
young
vizetelly
a
friend
of
my
son
adding
did
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
i
replied
in
the
negative
saying
that
i
had
not
even
recognized
him
from
behind
and
trying
to
explain
that
it
was
purely
by
chance
that
i
had
been
following
him
and
gambetta
you
know
me
then
exclaimed
the
future
dictator
somewhat
sharply
whereupon
i
mentioned
that
he
had
been
pointed
out
to
me
more
than
once
notably
when
he
was
in
the
company
of
delescluze
ah
oui
fort
bien
he
answered
i
am
sorry
if
i
spoke
as
i
did
but
and
here
he
turned
to
simon
one
never
knows
one
can
never
take
too
many
precautions
the
spaniard
would
willingly
send
both
of
us
to
mazas
by
the
spaniard
of
course
he
meant
the
empress
eugénie
just
as
people
meant
when
they
referred
to
the
austrian
during
the
first
revolution
that
ended
the
affair
they
both
shook
hands
with
me
i
raised
my
hat
and
hurried
on
to
the
grand
café
leaving
them
to
their
private
conversation
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
ever
exchanged
words
with
gambetta
the
incident
must
have
occurred
just
after
his
return
from
switzerland
whither
he
had
repaired
fully
anticipating
the
triumph
of
the
french
arms
returning
however
directly
he
heard
of
the
first
disasters
simon
and
he
were
naturally
drawn
together
by
their
opposition
to
the
empire
but
they
were
men
of
very
different
characters
and
some
six
months
later
they
were
at
daggers
drawn
events
moved
rapidly
during
palikao
ministry
reviving
a
former
proposition
of
jules
favre
gambetta
proposed
to
the
legislative
body
the
formation
of
a
committee
of
national
defence
and
one
was
ultimately
appointed
but
the
only
member
of
the
opposition
included
in
it
was
thiers
in
the
middle
of
august
there
were
some
revolutionary
disturbances
at
la
villette
then
after
the
famous
conference
at
châlons
where
rouher
prince
napoleon
and
others
discussed
the
situation
with
the
emperor
and
macmahon
trochu
was
appointed
military
governor
of
paris
where
he
soon
found
himself
at
loggerheads
with
palikao
meantime
the
french
under
bazaine
to
whom
the
emperor
was
obliged
to
relinquish
the
supreme
command
the
opposition
deputies
particularly
insisting
on
bazaine
appointment
in
his
stead
were
experiencing
reverse
after
reverse
the
battle
of
courcelles
or
pange
on
august
was
followed
two
days
later
by
that
of
vionville
or
and
after
yet
another
two
days
came
the
great
struggle
of
gravelotte
and
bazaine
was
thrown
back
on
metz
at
the
châlons
conference
it
had
been
decided
that
the
emperor
should
return
to
paris
and
that
macmahon
army
also
should
retreat
towards
the
capital
but
palikao
telegraphed
to
napoleon
if
you
abandon
bazaine
there
will
be
revolution
in
paris
and
you
yourself
will
be
attacked
by
all
the
enemy
forces
paris
will
defend
herself
from
all
assault
from
outside
the
fortifications
are
completed
it
has
been
argued
that
the
plan
to
save
bazaine
might
have
succeeded
had
it
been
immediately
carried
into
effect
and
in
accordance
too
with
palikao
ideas
but
the
original
scheme
was
modified
delay
ensued
and
the
french
were
outmarched
by
the
germans
who
came
up
with
them
at
sedan
as
for
palikao
statement
that
the
paris
fortifications
were
completed
at
the
time
when
he
despatched
his
telegram
that
was
absolutely
untrue
the
armament
of
the
outlying
forts
had
scarcely
begun
and
not
a
single
gun
was
in
position
on
any
one
of
the
bastions
of
the
ramparts
on
the
other
hand
palikao
was
certainly
doing
all
he
could
for
the
city
he
had
formed
the
aforementioned
committee
of
defence
and
under
his
auspices
the
fosse
or
ditch
in
front
of
the
ramparts
was
carried
across
the
roads
leading
into
paris
whilst
drawbridges
were
installed
on
all
these
points
with
armed
lunettes
in
front
of
them
again
redoubts
were
thrown
up
in
advance
of
some
of
the
outlying
forts
or
on
spots
where
breaks
occurred
in
the
chain
of
defensive
works
at
the
same
time
ships
guns
were
ordered
up
from
cherbourg
brest
lorient
and
toulon
together
with
naval
gunners
to
serve
them
sailors
customhouse
officers
and
provincial
gendarmes
were
also
conveyed
to
paris
in
considerable
numbers
and
even
firemen
likewise
came
from
the
provinces
whilst
the
work
of
provisioning
the
city
proceeded
briskly
the
chamber
never
hesitating
to
vote
all
the
money
asked
of
it
at
the
same
time
whilst
there
were
many
new
arrivals
in
paris
there
were
also
many
departures
from
the
city
the
general
fear
of
a
siege
spread
rapidly
every
day
thousands
of
folk
went
off
in
order
to
place
themselves
out
of
harm
way
and
at
the
same
time
thousands
of
foreigners
were
expelled
on
the
ground
that
in
the
event
of
a
siege
occurring
they
would
merely
be
useless
mouths
in
contrast
with
that
exodus
was
the
great
inrush
of
people
from
the
suburbs
of
paris
they
poured
into
the
city
unceasingly
from
villas
cottages
and
farms
employing
every
variety
of
vehicle
to
convey
their
furniture
and
other
household
goods
their
corn
flour
wine
and
other
produce
there
was
a
block
at
virtually
every
city
gate
so
many
were
the
folk
eager
for
shelter
within
the
protecting
ramparts
raised
at
the
instigation
of
thiers
some
thirty
years
previously
in
point
of
fact
although
the
germans
were
not
yet
really
marching
on
paris
for
bazaine
army
had
to
be
bottled
up
and
macmahon
disposed
of
before
there
could
be
an
effective
advance
on
the
french
capital
it
was
imagined
in
the
city
and
its
outskirts
that
the
enemy
might
arrive
at
any
moment
the
general
alarm
was
intensified
when
on
the
night
of
august
a
large
body
of
invalided
men
who
had
fought
at
weissenburg
or
worth
made
their
way
into
paris
looking
battle
and
some
with
their
heads
bandaged
others
with
their
arms
in
slings
and
others
limping
along
with
the
help
of
sticks
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
by
what
aberration
the
authorities
allowed
the
parisians
to
obtain
that
woeful
glimpse
of
the
misfortunes
of
france
the
men
in
question
ought
never
to
have
been
sent
to
paris
at
all
they
might
well
have
been
cared
for
elsewhere
as
it
happened
the
sorry
sight
affected
all
who
beheld
it
some
were
angered
by
it
others
depressed
and
others
terrified
as
a
kind
of
however
to
that
gloomy
spectacle
fresh
rumours
of
french
successes
began
to
circulate
there
was
a
report
that
army
had
annihilated
the
whole
of
prince
cavalry
and
in
particular
there
was
a
most
sensational
account
of
how
three
german
including
the
famous
white
cuirassiers
to
which
bismarck
belonged
had
been
tumbled
into
the
quarries
of
jaumont
and
there
absolutely
destroyed
i
will
not
say
that
there
is
no
locality
named
jaumont
but
i
can
not
find
any
such
place
mentioned
in
joanne
elaborate

of
the
communes
of
france
and
possibly
it
was
as
mythical
as
was
the
alleged
german
disaster
the
rumours
of
which
momentarily
revived
the
spirits
of
the
deluded
parisians
who
were
particularly
pleased
to
think
that
the
hated
bismarck
regiment
had
been
annihilated
on
or
about
august
a
friend
of
my
eldest
brother
adrian
a
medical
man
named
blewitt
arrived
in
paris
with
the
object
of
joining
an
ambulance
which
was
being
formed
in
connection
with
the
red
cross
society
blewitt
spoke
a
little
french
but
he
was
not
well
acquainted
with
the
city
and
i
was
deputed
to
assist
him
whilst
he
remained
there
an
interesting
account
of
the
doings
of
the
ambulance
in
question
was
written
some
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
ago
by
charles
edward
ryan
of
glenlara
tipperary
who
belonged
to
it
its
head
men
were
and
frank
others
being
ryan
as
already
mentioned
and
drs
blewitt
webb
may
nicholl
hayden
howett
tilghmann
and
last
but
not
least
the
future
sir
william
maccormack
blewitt
had
a
variety
of
business
to
transact
with
the
officials
of
the
french
red
cross
society
and
i
was
with
him
at
his
interviews
with
its
president
the
count
de
flavigny
and
others
it
is
of
interest
to
recall
that
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
the
society
only
means
was
an
income
of
but
that
by
august
its
receipts
had
risen
to
nearly
by
october
it
had
expended
more
than
in
organizing
field
ambulances
its
total
outlay
during
the
war
exceeded
half
a
million
sterling
and
in
its
various
field
town
and
village
ambulances
no
fewer
than
men
were
succoured
and
nursed
in
paris
the
society
headquarters
were
established
at
the
palace
de
in
the
champs
elysées
and
among
the
members
of
its
principal
committee
were
several
ladies
of
high
rank
i
well
remember
seeing
there
that
great
leader
of
fashion
the
marquise
de
galliffet
whose
elaborate
ball
gowns
i
had
more
than
once
admired
at
worth
but
who
now
that
misfortune
had
fallen
upon
france
was
like
all
her
friends
very
plainly
garbed
in
black
at
the
palais
de
i
also
found
mme
de
macmahon
short
and
plump
but
full
of
dignity
and
energy
as
became
a
daughter
of
the
castries
i
remember
a
brief
address
which
she
delivered
to
the
ambulance
on
the
day
when
it
quitted
paris
and
in
which
she
thanked
its
members
for
their
courage
and
devotion
in
coming
forward
and
expressed
her
confidence
and
that
of
all
her
friends
in
the
kindly
services
which
they
would
undoubtedly
bestow
upon
every
sufferer
who
came
under
their
care
i
accompanied
the
ambulance
on
its
march
through
paris
to
the
eastern
hallway
station
when
it
was
drawn
up
outside
the
palais
de
count
de
flavigny
in
his
turn
made
a
short
but
feeling
speech
and
immediately
afterwards
the
started
at
the
head
of
it
were
three
young
ladies
the
daughters
of
who
carried
respectively
the
flags
of
france
england
and
the
united
states
then
came
the
chief
surgeons
the
the
dressers
and
male
nurses
with
some
waggons
of
stores
bringing
up
the
rear
i
walked
i
remember
between
blewitt
and
may
on
either
side
of
the
procession
were
members
of
the
red
cross
society
carrying
sticks
or
poles
tipped
with
collection
bags
into
which
money
speedily
began
to
rain
we
crossed
the
place
de
la
concorde
turned
up
the
rue
royale
and
then
followed
the
main
boulevards
as
far
i
think
as
the
boulevard
de
strasbourg
there
were
crowds
of
people
on
either
hand
and
our
progress
was
necessarily
slow
as
it
was
desired
to
give
the
onlookers
full
time
to
deposit
their
offerings
in
the
from
the
cercle
impérial
at
the
corner
of
the
champs
elysées
from
the
jockey
club
the
turf
club
the
union
the
fer
the
ganaches
and
other
clubs
on
or
adjacent
to
the
boulevards
came
servants
often
in
liveries
bearing
with
them
both
and
gold
everybody
seemed
anxious
to
give
something
and
an
official
of
the
society
afterwards
told
me
that
the
collection
had
proved
the
largest
it
had
ever
made
there
was
also
great
enthusiasm
all
along
the
line
of
route
cries
of
vivent
les
anglais
vivent
les
américains
resounding
upon
every
side
the
train
by
which
the
ambulance
quitted
paris
did
not
start
until
a
very
late
hour
in
the
evening
prior
to
its
departure
most
of
us
dined
at
a
restaurant
near
the
no
little
champagne
was
consumed
at
this
repast
and
unaccustomed
as
i
was
to
the
sparkling
wine
of
the
marne
it
got
i
fear
slightly
into
my
head
however
my
services
as
interpreter
were
requisitioned
more
than
once
by
some
members
of
the
ambulance
in
connection
with
certain
inquiries
which
they
wished
to
make
of
the
railway
officials
and
i
recollect
that
when
some
question
arose
of
going
in
and
out
of
the
station
and
reaching
the
platform
again
without
let
or
hindrance
the
departure
of
the
train
being
long
delayed
the
de
made
me
a
most
courteous
bow
and
responded
à
vous
messieurs
tout
est
permis
there
are
no
regulations
for
you
at
last
the
train
started
proceeding
on
its
way
to
soissons
where
it
arrived
at
daybreak
on
august
the
ambulance
then
hastening
to
join
macmahon
and
reaching
him
just
in
time
to
be
of
good
service
at
sedan
i
will
only
add
here
that
my
friend
blewitt
was
with
frank
at
balan
and
bazeilles
where
the
slaughter
was
so
terrible
the
rest
of
the
ambulance
dramatic
story
must
be
read
in
ryan
deeply
interesting
pages
whilst
the
parisians
were
being
beguiled
with
stories
of
how
the
prince
of
had
written
to
his
wife
telling
her
that
the
german
troops
were
suffering
terribly
from
sore
feet
the
said
troops
were
in
point
of
fact
lustily
outmarching
macmahon
forces
on
august
general
de
failly
was
badly
worsted
at
beaumont
and
on
the
following
day
macmahon
was
forced
to
move
on
sedan
the
first
reports
which
reached
paris
indicated
as
usual
very
favourable
results
respecting
the
contest
there
my
friend
captain
bingham
however
obtained
some
correct
information
from
i
believe
the
british
embassy
and
i
have
always
understood
that
it
was
he
who
first
made
the
terrible
truth
known
to
one
of
the
deputies
of
the
opposition
party
who
hastened
to
convey
it
to
thiers
the
battle
of
sedan
was
fought
on
thursday
september
but
it
was
only
on
saturday
september
that
palikao
shadowed
forth
the
disaster
in
the
chamber
stating
that
macmahon
had
failed
to
effect
a
junction
with
bazaine
and
that
after
alternate
reverses
and
successes
that
is
driving
a
part
of
the
german
army
into
the
meuse
he
had
been
obliged
to
retreat
on
sedan
and
mézières
some
portion
of
his
forces
moreover
having
been
compelled
to
cross
the
belgian
frontier
that
tissue
of
inaccuracies
devised
perhaps
to
palliate
the
effect
of
the
german
telegrams
of
victory
which
were
now
becoming
known
to
the
incredulous
parisians
was
torn
to
shreds
a
few
hours
later
when
the
legislative
body
assembled
for
a
palikao
was
then
obliged
to
admit
that
the
french
army
and
the
emperor
napoleon
had
surrendered
to
the
victorious
german
force
jules
favre
who
was
the
recognized
leader
of
the
republican
opposition
thereupon
brought
forward
a
motion
of
dethronement
proposing
that
the
executive
authority
should
be
vested
in
a
parliamentary
committee
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
the
chamber
farve
motion
had
to
be
referred
to
its
or
ordinary
committees
and
thus
no
decision
was
arrived
at
that
night
it
being
agreed
that
the
chamber
should
reassemble
on
the
morrow
at
noon
the
deputies
separated
at
a
very
late
hour
my
father
and
myself
were
among
all
the
anxious
people
who
had
assembled
on
the
place
de
la
concorde
to
await
the
issue
of
the
debate
wild
talk
was
heard
on
every
side
imprecations
were
levelled
at
the
empire
and
it
was
already
suggested
that
the
country
had
been
sold
to
the
foreigner
at
last
as
the
crowd
became
extremely
restless
the
authorities
who
had
taken
their
precautions
in
consequence
of
the
revolutionary
spirit
which
was
abroad
decided
to
disperse
it
during
the
evening
a
considerable
body
of
mounted
gardes
de
paris
had
been
stationed
in
or
near
the
palais
de
and
now
on
instructions
being
conveyed
to
their
commander
they
suddenly
cantered
down
the
champs
elysées
and
cleared
the
square
chasing
people
round
and
round
the
fountains
and
the
seated
statues
of
the
cities
of
france
until
they
fled
by
way
either
of
the
quays
the
rue
de
rivoti
or
the
rue
royale
the
vigour
which
the
troops
displayed
did
not
seem
of
good
augury
for
the
adversaries
of
the
empire
without
a
doubt
revolution
was
already
in
the
air
but
everything
indicated
that
the
authorities
were
quite
prepared
to
contend
with
it
and
in
all
probability
successfully
it
was
with
difficulty
that
my
father
and
myself
contrived
to
avoid
the
troopers
and
reach
the
avenue
gabriel
whence
we
made
our
way
home
meantime
there
had
been
disturbances
in
other
parts
of
paris
on
the
boulevard
bonne
nouvelle
a
band
of
demonstrators
had
come
into
collision
with
the
police
who
had
arrested
several
of
them
thus
as
i
have
already
mentioned
the
authorities
seemed
to
be
as
vigilant
and
as
energetic
as
ever
but
without
doubt
on
that
night
of
saturday
september
the
secret
republican
associations
were
very
active
sending
the
from
one
to
another
part
of
the
city
so
that
all
might
be
ready
for
revolution
when
the
legislative
body
assembled
on
the
morrow
it
was
on
this
same
last
night
of
the
empire
that
george
augustus
sala
met
with
the
very
unpleasant
adventure
to
which
i
previously
referred
during
the
evening
he
went
as
usual
to
the
grand
café
and
meeting
blanchard
jerrold
there
he
endeavoured
to
induce
him
to
go
to
supper
at
the
café
du
helder
sala
being
in
an
even
more
talkative
mood
than
usual
and
now
that
he
had
heard
of
the
disaster
of
sedan
more
than
ever
inclined
to
express
his
contempt
of
the
french
in
regard
to
military
matters
jerrold
declined
the
invitation
fearing
as
he
afterwards
said
to
my
father
in
my
presence
that
some
unpleasantness
might
well
ensue
as
sala
in
spite
of
all
remonstrances
would
not
cease
gassing
apropos
of
that
expression
it
is
somewhat
amusing
to
recall
that
sala
at
one
time
designed
for
himself
an
illuminated
on
which
appeared
his
initials
in
letters
of
gold
the
a
being
intersected
by
a
diffusing
many
vivid
rays
of
light
whilst
underneath
it
was
a
scroll
bearing
the
appropriate
motto
dux
est
lux
but
to
return
to
my
story
jerrold
having
refused
the
invitation
sala
repaired
alone
to
the
café
du
helder
an
establishment
which
in
those
imperial
times
was
particularly
patronized
by
officers
of
the
paris
garrison
and
officers
from
the
provinces
on
leave
it
was
the
height
of
folly
for
anybody
to
run
down
the
french
army
in
such
a
place
unless
indeed
he
wished
to
have
a
number
of
duels
on
his
hands
it
is
true
that
on
the
night
of
september
there
may
have
been
few
if
any
military
men
at
the
helder
certain
it
is
however
that
whilst
sala
was
supping
in
the
principal
room
upstairs
he
entered
into
conversation
with
other
people
spoke
incautiously
as
he
had
been
doing
for
a
week
past
and
on
departing
from
the
establishment
was
summarily
arrested
and
conveyed
to
the
poste
de
police
on
the
boulevard
bonne
nouvelle
the
cells
there
were
already
more
or
less
crowded
with
roughs
who
had
been
arrested
during
the
disturbance
earlier
in
the
evening
and
when
a
police
official
thrust
sala
into
their
midst
at
the
same
time
calling
him
a
vile
prussian
spy
the
patriotism
of
the
other
prisoners
was
immediately
aroused
though
for
the
most
part
they
were
utter
scamps
who
had
only
created
a
disturbance
for
the
purpose
of
filling
their
pockets
sala
was
subjected
not
merely
to
much
but
also
to
indignities
which
only
rabelais
or
zola
could
have
in
different
ways
adequately
described
and
it
was
not
until
the
morning
that
he
was
able
to
communicate
with
the
manager
of
the
grand
hotel
where
he
had
his
quarters
the
manager
acquainted
the
british
embassy
with
his
predicament
and
it
was
i
think
sheffield
who
repaired
to
the
préfecture
de
police
to
obtain
an
order
for
sala
liberation
the
story
told
me
at
the
time
was
that
lord
lyons
representative
found
matters
already
in
great
confusion
at
the
préfecture
there
had
been
a
stampede
of
officials
scarcely
any
being
at
their
posts
in
such
wise
that
he
made
his
way
to
the
prefect
sanctum
unannounced
there
he
found
piétri
engaged
with
a
confidential
acolyte
in
destroying
a
large
number
of
compromising
papers
emptying
boxes
and
in
swift
succession
and
piling
their
contents
on
an
already
huge
fire
which
was
stirred
incessantly
in
order
that
it
might
burn
more
swiftly
piétri
only
paused
in
his
task
in
order
to
write
an
order
for
sala
release
and
i
have
always
understood
that
this
was
the
last
official
order
that
emanated
from
the
famous
prefect
of
the
second
empire
it
is
true
that
he
presented
himself
at
the
tuileries
before
he
fled
to
belgium
but
the
empress
as
we
know
was
averse
from
any
armed
conflict
with
the
population
of
paris
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
prefecture
had
spent
its
last
strength
during
the
night
of
september
disorganized
as
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
it
could
not
have
fought
the
revolution
as
will
presently
appear
those
police
who
on
the
night
of
the
were
chosen
to
assist
in
guarding
the
approaches
to
the
palais
bourbon
on
the
morrow
were
quite
unable
to
do
so
disorder
indeed
prevailed
in
many
places
my
father
had
recently
found
himself
in
a
dilemma
in
regard
to
the
requirements
of
the
london
in
those
days
the
universal
was
unknown
every
scene
that
it
was
desired
to
depict
in
the
paper
had
to
be
sketched
and
in
presence
of
all
the
defensive
preparations
which
were
being
made
a
question
arose
as
to
what
might
and
what
might
not
be
sketched
general
trochu
was
governor
of
paris
and
applications
were
made
to
him
on
the
subject
a
reply
came
requiring
a
reference
from
the
british
embassy
before
any
permission
whatever
was
granted
in
due
course
a
letter
was
obtained
from
the
embassy
signed
not
i
think
by
lord
lyons
himself
but
by
one
of
the
secretaries
perhaps
sir
edward
malet
or
wodehouse
or
even
sheffield
at
all
events
on
the
morning
of
september
my
father
being
anxious
to
settle
the
matter
commissioned
me
to
take
the
embassy
letter
to
trochu
quarters
at
the
louvre
here
i
found
great
confusion
nobody
was
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
official
work
the
were
half
deserted
officers
came
and
went
incessantly
or
gathered
in
little
groups
in
the
passages
and
on
the
stairs
all
of
them
looking
extremely
upset
and
talking
anxiously
and
excitedly
together
i
could
find
nobody
to
attend
to
any
business
and
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
when
a
door
opened
and
a
general
officer
in
undress
uniform
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
a
large
and
finely
appointed
room
i
immediately
recognized
trochu
extremely
bald
head
and
determined
jaw
for
since
his
nomination
as
governor
paris
had
been
flooded
with
portraits
of
him
he
had
opened
the
door
i
believe
to
look
for
an
officer
but
on
seeing
me
standing
there
with
a
letter
in
my
hand
he
inquired
what
i
wanted
i
replied
that
i
had
brought
a
letter
from
the
british
embassy
and
he
may
perhaps
have
thought
that
i
was
an
embassy
messenger
at
all
events
he
took
the
letter
from
me
saying
curtly
bien
je
occuperai
revenez
cet
with
those
words
he
stepped
back
into
the
room
and
carefully
placed
the
letter
on
the
top
of
several
others
which
were
neatly
disposed
on
a
the
incident
was
trivial
in
itself
yet
it
afforded
a
glimpse
of
character
here
was
the
man
who
in
his
earlier
years
had
organized
the
french
expedition
to
the
crimea
in
a
manner
far
superior
to
that
in
which
our
own
had
been
organized
a
man
of
method
order
precision
fully
qualified
to
prepare
the
defence
of
paris
though
not
to
lead
her
army
in
the
field
brief
as
was
that
interview
of
mine
i
could
not
help
noticing
how
perfectly
calm
and
he
was
for
his
demeanour
greatly
contrasted
with
the
anxious
or
excited
bearing
of
his
subordinates
yet
he
had
reached
the
supreme
crisis
of
his
life
the
empire
was
falling
a
first
offer
of
power
had
been
made
to
him
on
the
previous
evening
and
a
second
offer
which
he
finally
accepted
see
my
book
republican
france
p
was
almost
imminent
yet
on
that
morning
of
revolution
he
appeared
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
i
quitted
the
louvre
going
towards
the
rue
royale
it
having
been
arranged
with
my
father
that
we
should
take
at
a
restaurant
there
it
was
called
his
lordship
larder
and
was
an
english
house
though
the
landlord
bore
the
german
name
of
weber
he
and
his
family
were
unhappily
suffocated
in
the
cellars
of
their
establishment
during
one
of
the
conflagrations
which
marked
the
bloody
week
of
the
commune
at
the
time
when
i
met
my
father
that
is
about
noon
there
was
nothing
particularly
ominous
in
the
appearance
of
the
streets
along
which
i
myself
passed
it
was
a
fine
bright
sunday
and
as
was
usual
on
such
a
day
there
were
plenty
of
people
abroad
recently
enrolled
national
guards
certainly
predominated
among
the
men
but
the
latter
included
many
in
civilian
attire
and
there
was
no
lack
of
women
and
children
as
for
agitation
i
saw
no
sign
of
it
as
i
was
afterwards
told
however
by
delmas
the
landlord
of
the
café
grétry
note
matters
were
very
different
that
morning
on
the
boulevards
and
particularly
on
the
boulevard
montmartre
by
ten
indeed
great
crowds
had
assembled
there
and
the
excitement
grew
apace
the
same
words
were
on
all
lips
sedan
the
whole
french
army
taken
the
wretched
emperor
sword
surrendered
unworthy
to
reign
dethrone
him
just
as
in
another
crisis
of
french
history
men
had
climbed
on
to
the
chairs
and
tables
in
the
garden
of
the
palais
royal
to
denounce
monsieur
and
madame
véto
and
urge
the
parisians
to
march
upon
versailles
so
now
others
climbed
on
the
chairs
outside
the
boulevard
cafés
to
denounce
the
empire
and
urge
a
march
upon
the
palais
bourbon
where
the
legislative
body
was
about
to
meet
and
amidst
the
general
clamour
one
cry
persistently
prevailed
it
was
déchéance
déchéance
dethronement
dethronement
note
this
was
a
little
café
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
and
was
noted
for
its
quietude
during
the
afternoon
though
in
the
evening
it
was
by
reason
of
its
proximity
to
the
petite
bourse
held
on
the
in
front
of
it
invaded
by
noisy
speculators
captain
bingham
my
father
and
myself
long
frequented
the
café
grétry
often
writing
our
paris
letters
there
subsequent
to
the
war
bingham
and
i
removed
to
the
café
cardinal
where
however
the
everlasting
rattle
of
dominoes
proved
very
disturbing
in
the
end
on
that
account
and
in
order
to
be
nearer
to
a
club
to
which
we
both
belonged
we
emigrated
to
the
café
napolitain
one
reason
for
writing
one
copy
at
a
café
instead
of
at
one
club
was
that
at
the
former
one
could
at
any
moment
receive
messengers
bringing
late
news
in
addition
to
which
afternoon
newspapers
were
instantly
available
at
every
moment
the
numbers
of
the
crowd
increased
continually
arrived
from
the
eastern
districts
by
way
of
the
boulevards
and
from
the
north
by
way
of
the
faubourg
montmartre
and
the
rue
drouot
whilst
from
the
south
the
quartier
latin
and
its
neighbourhood
contingents
made
their
way
across
the
pont
michel
and
the
pont
notre
dame
and
thence
past
the
halles
along
the
boulevard
de
sebastopol
and
the
rue
montmartre
why
the
quartier
latin
element
did
not
advance
direct
on
the
palais
bourbon
from
its
own
side
of
the
river
i
can
not
exactly
say
but
it
was
i
believe
thought
desirable
to
join
hands
in
the
first
instance
with
the
revolutionary
elements
of
northern
paris
all
this
took
place
whilst
my
father
and
myself
were
partaking
of
our
meal
when
we
quitted
the
larder
a
little
before
one
all
the
small
parties
of
national
guards
and
civilians
whom
we
had
observed
strolling
about
at
an
earlier
hour
had
congregated
on
the
place
de
la
concorde
attracted
thither
by
the
news
of
the
special
sunday
sitting
at
which
the
legislative
body
would
undoubtedly
take
momentous
decisions
it
should
be
added
that
nearly
all
the
national
guards
who
assembled
on
the
place
de
la
concorde
before
one
were
absolutely
unarmed
at
that
hour
however
a
large
force
of
them
equivalent
to
a
couple
of
battalions
or
thereabouts
came
marching
down
the
rue
royale
from
the
boulevards
and
these
men
who
were
preceded
by
a
solitary
drummer
carried
some
of
them
chassepots
and
others
having
moreover
in
most
instances
their
bayonets
fixed
they
belonged
to
the
north
of
paris
though
i
can
not
say
precisely
to
what
particular
districts
nor
do
i
know
exactly
by
whose
orders
they
had
been
assembled
and
instructed
to
march
on
the
palais
bourbon
as
they
speedily
did
but
it
is
certain
that
all
the
fermentation
of
the
morning
and
all
that
occurred
afterwards
was
the
outcome
of
the
of
the
secret
republican
committees
as
the
guards
marched
on
loud
cries
of
déchéance
déchéance
arose
among
them
and
were
at
once
taken
up
by
the
spectators
perfect
unanimity
indeed
appeared
to
prevail
on
the
question
of
dethroning
the
emperor
even
the
soldiers
who
were
scattered
here
and
there
a
few
linesmen
a
few
zouaves
a
few
turcos
some
of
them
invalided
from
macmahon
forces
eagerly
joined
in
the
universal
cry
and
began
to
follow
the
guards
on
to
the
place
de
la
concorde
never
i
believe
had
that
square
been
more
crowded
not
even
in
the
days
when
it
was
known
as
the
place
louis
quinze
and
when
hundreds
of
people
were
crushed
to
death
there
whilst
witnessing
a
display
of
fireworks
in
connection
with
the
espousals
of
the
future
louis
xvi
and
marie
antoinette
not
even
when
it
had
become
the
place
de
la
révolution
and
was
thronged
by
all
who
wished
to
witness
the
successive
executions
of
the
last
king
and
queen
of
the
old
french
monarchy
from
the
end
of
the
rue
royale
to
the
bridge
conducting
across
the
seine
to
the
palais
bourbon
from
the
gate
of
the
tuileries
garden
to
the
horses
of
marly
at
the
entrance
of
the
champs
elysées
around
the
obelisk
of
luxor
and
the
fountains
which
were
playing
as
usual
in
the
bright
sunshine
which
fell
from
the
blue
sky
along
all
the
balustrades
connecting
the
seated
statues
of
the
cities
of
france
here
there
and
everywhere
indeed
you
saw
human
heads
and
the
clamour
was
universal
the
great
square
had
again
become
one
of
revolution
and
yet
it
remained
one
of
concord
also
for
there
was
absolute
agreement
among
the
hundred
thousand
or
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
who
had
chosen
it
as
their
an
agreement
attested
by
that
universal
and
cry
of
dethronement
as
the
armed
national
guards
debouched
from
the
rue
royale
their
solitary
drummer
plied
his
sticks
but
the
roll
of
the
drum
was
scarcely
heard
in
the
general
uproar
and
so
dense
was
the
crowd
that
the
men
could
advance
but
very
slowly
for
a
while
it
took
some
minutes
to
make
only
a
few
steps
meantime
the
ranks
of
the
men
were
broken
here
and
there
other
people
got
among
them
and
at
last
my
father
and
myself
were
caught
in
the
stream
and
carried
with
it
still
somewhat
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
pont
de
la
concorde
i
read
recently
that
the
bridge
was
defended
by
mounted
men
of
the
garde
de
paris
the
forerunner
of
the
garde
républicaine
of
a
french
writer
in
recalling
the
scene
referring
to
the
men
helmets
glistening
in
the
sunshine
but
that
is
pure
imagination
the
bridge
was
defended
by
a
cordon
of
police
ranged
in
front
of
a
large
body
of
gendarmerie
mobile
wearing
the
familiar
dark
blue
and
the
dark
blue
tunics
with
white
aiguillettes
at
first
as
i
have
already
said
we
advanced
but
slowly
towards
that
defending
force
but
all
at
once
we
were
swept
onward
by
other
men
who
had
come
from
the
boulevards
in
our
wake
a
minute
later
an
abrupt
halt
ensued
whereupon
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
we
were
able
to
resist
the
pressure
from
behind
i
at
last
contrived
to
raise
myself
on
tiptoes
our
first
ranks
had
effected
a
breach
in
those
of
the
but
before
us
were
the
mounted
gendarmes
whose
officer
suddenly
gave
a
command
and
drew
his
sword
for
an
instant
i
saw
him
plainly
his
face
was
intensely
pale
but
a
sudden
rattle
succeeded
his
command
for
his
men
responded
to
it
by
drawing
their
sabres
which
flashed
ominously
a
minute
perhaps
two
minutes
elapsed
the
pressure
in
our
rear
still
and
ever
increasing
i
do
not
know
what
happened
exactly
at
the
head
of
our
column
the
uproar
was
greater
than
ever
and
it
seemed
as
if
in
another
moment
we
should
be
charged
ridden
over
cut
down
or
dispersed
i
believe
however
that
in
presence
of
that
great
concourse
of
people
in
presence
too
of
the
universal
reprobation
of
the
empire
which
had
brought
defeat
invasion
humiliation
upon
france
the
officer
commanding
the
gendarmes
shrank
from
carrying
out
his
orders
there
must
have
been
a
brief
parley
with
the
leaders
of
our
column
in
any
case
the
ranks
of
the
gendarmes
suddenly
opened
many
of
them
taking
to
the
footways
of
the
bridge
over
which
our
column
swept
at
the
raising
exultant
shouts
of
vive
la
république
it
was
almost
a
race
as
to
who
should
be
the
first
to
reach
the
palais
bourbon
those
in
the
rear
were
ever
impelling
the
foremost
onward
and
there
was
no
time
to
look
about
one
but
in
a
rapid
vision
as
it
were
i
saw
the
gendarmes
reining
in
their
horses
on
either
side
of
us
and
here
and
there
medals
gleamed
on
their
dark
tunics
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
more
than
one
face
wore
an
angry
expression
these
men
had
fought
under
the
imperial
eagles
they
had
been
decorated
for
their
valour
in
the
crimean
italian
and
wars
veterans
all
and
faithful
servants
of
the
empire
they
saw
the
for
which
they
had
fought
collapsing
had
their
commanding
officer
ordered
it
they
might
well
have
charged
us
but
obedient
to
discipline
they
had
opened
their
ranks
and
now
the
will
of
the
people
was
sweeping
past
them
none
of
our
column
had
a
particularly
threatening
mien
the
general
demeanour
was
rather
suggestive
of
joyful
expectancy
but
the
bridge
once
crossed
there
was
a
fresh
pause
at
the
gates
shutting
off
the
steps
of
the
palais
bourbon
here
infantry
were
assembled
with
their
chassepots
in
readiness
another
very
brief
but
exciting
interval
ensued
then
the
linesmen
were
withdrawn
the
gates
swung
open
and
everybody
rushed
up
the
steps
i
was
carried
hither
and
thither
and
at
last
from
the
portico
into
the
building
where
i
contrived
to
halt
beside
one
of
the
statues
in
the
salle
des
pas
perdus
i
looked
for
my
father
but
could
not
see
him
and
remained
wedged
in
my
corner
for
quite
a
considerable
time
finally
however
another
rush
of
invaders
dislodged
me
and
i
was
swept
with
many
others
into
the
chamber
itself
all
was
uproar
and
confusion
there
very
few
deputies
were
present
the
public
galleries
the
seats
of
the
members
the
hemicycle
in
front
of
the
tribune
were
crowded
with
national
guards
some
were
standing
on
the
stenographers
table
and
on
the
ushers
chairs
below
the
tribune
there
were
others
on
the
tribune
stairs
and
at
the
tribune
itself
with
his
hat
on
his
head
stood
gambetta
hoarsely
shouting
amidst
the
general
din
that
louis
napoleon
bonaparte
and
his
dynasty
had
for
ever
ceased
to
reign
then
again
and
again
arose
the
cry
of
vive
la
république
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
however
gambetta
was
lost
to
view
he
and
other
republican
deputies
betaking
themselves
as
i
afterwards
learnt
to
the
palace
steps
where
the
dethronement
of
the
bonapartes
was
again
proclaimed
the
invaders
of
the
chamber
swarmed
after
them
and
i
was
watching
their
departure
when
i
suddenly
saw
my
father
quietly
leaning
back
in
one
of
the
ministerial
seats
perhaps
that
which
in
the
past
had
been
occupied
by
billault
rouher
ollivier
and
other
powerful
and
prominent
men
of
the
fallen
at
the
outset
of
the
proceedings
that
day
palikao
had
proposed
the
formation
of
a
council
of
government
and
national
defence
which
was
to
include
five
members
of
the
legislative
body
the
ministers
were
to
be
appointed
by
this
council
and
he
was
to
be
of
france
it
so
happened
that
the
more
fervent
imperialists
had
previously
offered
him
a
dictatorship
but
he
had
declined
it
jules
favre
met
the
proposal
by
claiming
priority
for
the
motion
which
he
had
submitted
at
the
midnight
sitting
whilst
thiers
tried
to
bring
about
a
compromise
by
suggesting
such
a
committee
as
palikao
had
indicated
but
placing
the
choice
of
its
members
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
legislative
body
omitting
all
reference
to
palikao
lieutenancy
and
further
setting
forth
that
a
constituent
assembly
should
be
convoked
as
soon
as
circumstances
might
permit
the
three
proposals
thiers
favre
and
palikao
were
submitted
to
the
and
whilst
these
were
deliberating
in
various
rooms
the
first
invasion
of
the
chamber
took
place
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
jules
ferry
who
had
promised
palikao
that
the
proceedings
of
the
legislature
should
not
be
disturbed
when
the
sitting
was
resumed
the
invaders
who
at
that
moment
mainly
occupied
the
galleries
would
listen
neither
to
president
schneider
nor
to
their
favourite
gambetta
though
both
appealed
to
them
for
silence
and
order
jules
favre
alone
secured
a
few
moments
quietude
during
which
he
begged
that
there
might
be
no
violence
palikao
was
present
but
did
not
speak
later
in
the
day
after
urging
trochu
to
accept
the
presidency
of
the
new
government
as
otherwise
all
might
be
lost
palikao
quitted
paris
for
belgium
he
stayed
at
namur
during
the
remainder
of
the
war
and
afterwards
lived
in
retirement
at
versailles
where
he
died
in
january
amidst
the
general
confusion
came
the
second
invasion
of
the
chamber
when
i
was
swept
off
my
feet
and
carried
on
to
the
floor
of
the
house
that
second
invasion
precipitated
events
even
gambetta
wished
the
dethronement
of
the
dynasty
to
be
signified
by
a
formal
vote
but
the
invaders
would
brook
no
delay
both
of
us
my
father
and
i
were
tired
and
thirsty
after
our
unexpected
experiences
accordingly
we
did
not
follow
the
crowd
back
to
the
steps
overlooking
the
place
de
la
concorde
but
like
a
good
many
other
people
we
went
off
by
way
of
the
place
de
bourgogne
no
damage
had
been
done
in
the
chamber
itself
but
as
we
quitted
the
building
we
noticed
several
inscriptions
scrawled
upon
the
walls
in
some
instances
the
words
were
merely
vive
la
république
and
mort
aux
prussiens
at
other
times
however
they
were
too
disgusting
to
be
set
down
here
in
or
near
the
rue
de
bourgogne
we
found
a
fairly
quiet
where
we
rested
and
refreshed
ourselves
with
of
bière
de
strasbourg
we
did
not
go
at
that
moment
to
the
whither
a
large
part
of
the
crowd
betook
itself
by
way
of
the
quays
and
where
the
republic
was
again
proclaimed
but
returned
to
the
place
de
la
concorde
where
some
thousands
of
people
still
remained
everybody
was
looking
very
animated
and
very
pleased
everybody
imagined
that
the
empire
being
overthrown
france
would
soon
drive
back
the
german
invader
all
fears
for
the
future
seemed
indeed
to
have
departed
universal
confidence
prevailed
and
everybody
congratulated
everybody
else
there
was
in
any
case
one
good
cause
for
congratulation
the
revolution
had
been
absolutely
bloodless
the
first
and
only
phenomenon
of
the
kind
in
all
french
history
whilst
we
were
strolling
about
the
place
de
la
concorde
i
noticed
that
the
chief
gate
of
the
tuileries
garden
had
been
forced
open
and
damaged
the
gilded
eagles
which
had
decorated
it
had
been
struck
off
and
pounded
to
pieces
this
it
appeared
having
been
chiefly
the
work
of
an
enterprising
turco
a
few
days
later
victorien
sardou
wrote
an
interesting
account
of
how
he
and
others
obtained
admittance
first
to
the
reserved
garden
and
then
to
the
palace
itself
on
glancing
towards
it
i
observed
that
the
flag
which
had
still
waved
over
the
principal
pavilion
that
morning
had
now
disappeared
it
had
been
lowered
after
the
departure
of
the
empress
of
the
last
hours
which
she
spent
in
the
palace
before
she
quitted
it
with
prince
metternich
and
count
nigra
to
seek
a
momentary
refuge
at
the
residence
of
her
dentist
evans
i
have
given
a
detailed
account
based
on
reliable
narratives
and
documents
in
my
court
of
the
tuileries
quitting
at
last
the
place
de
la
concorde
we
strolled
slowly
homeward
some
tradespeople
in
the
rue
royale
and
the
faubourg
honoré
former
purveyors
to
the
emperor
or
the
empress
were
already
hastily
removing
the
imperial
arms
from
above
their
shops
that
same
afternoon
and
during
the
ensuing
monday
and
tuesday
every
escutcheon
every
initial
n
every
crown
every
eagle
every
inscription
that
recalled
the
empire
was
removed
or
obliterated
in
one
or
another
manner
george
augustus
sala
whose
recent
adventure
confined
him
to
his
room
at
the
grand
hotel
spent
most
of
his
time
in
watching
the
men
who
removed
the
eagles
crowns
and
ns
from
the
then
unfinished
even
the
streets
which
recalled
the
imperial
were
hastily
renamed
the
avenue
de
at
once
became
the
avenue
du
bois
de
boulogne
and
the
rue
du
so
called
in
memory
of
napoleon
assumption
of
the
imperial
dignity
was
rechristened
rue
du
quatre
septembre
this
being
the
happy
thought
of
a
zouave
who
mounted
on
a
ladder
set
the
new
name
above
the
old
one
whilst
the
plate
bearing
the
latter
was
struck
off
with
a
hammer
by
a
young
workman
as
we
went
home
on
the
afternoon
of
that
memorable
fourth
we
noticed
that
all
the
cafés
and
were
doing
a
brisk
trade
neither
then
nor
during
the
evening
however
did
i
perceive
much
actual
drunkenness
it
was
rather
a
universal
jollity
as
though
some
great
victory
had
been
gained
truth
to
tell
the
increase
of
drunkenness
in
paris
was
an
effect
of
the
german
siege
of
the
city
when
drink
was
so
plentiful
and
food
so
scarce
my
father
and
i
had
reached
the
corner
of
our
street
when
we
witnessed
an
incident
which
i
have
related
in
detail
in
the
first
pages
of
my
book
republican
france
it
was
the
arrival
of
gambetta
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
by
way
of
the
avenue
de
marigny
with
an
escort
of
de
la
presse
the
future
dictator
had
seven
companions
with
him
all
huddled
inside
or
on
the
roof
of
a
cab
which
was
drawn
by
two
breton
nags
i
can
still
picture
him
alighting
from
the
vehicle
and
in
the
name
of
the
republic
ordering
a
chubby
little
linesman
who
was
mounting
guard
at
the
gate
of
the
ministry
to
have
the
said
gate
opened
and
i
can
see
the
sleek
and
elderly
who
had
bowed
to
many
an
imperial
minister
complying
with
the
said
injunction
and
respectfully
doffing
his
tasselled
and
bending
double
whilst
he
admitted
his
new
master
then
the
gate
is
closed
and
from
behind
the
ornamental
gambetta
briefly
addresses
the
little
throng
which
has
recognized
him
saying
that
the
empire
is
dead
but
that
france
is
wounded
and
that
her
very
wounds
will
inflame
her
with
fresh
courage
promising
too
that
the
whole
nation
shall
be
armed
and
asking
one
and
all
to
place
confidence
in
the
new
government
even
as
the
latter
will
place
confidence
in
the
people
in
the
evening
i
strolled
with
my
father
to
the
place
de
de
ville
where
many
people
were
congregated
a
fairly
large
body
of
national
guards
was
posted
in
front
of
the
building
most
of
whose
windows
were
lighted
up
the
members
of
the
new
government
of
national
defence
were
deliberating
there
trochu
had
become
its
president
and
jules
favre
its
and
minister
for
foreign
affairs
henri
rochefort
released
that
afternoon
by
his
admirers
from
the
prison
of
sainte
pélagie
was
included
in
the
administration
this
being
in
the
main
composed
of
the
deputies
for
paris
only
one
of
the
latter
the
cautious
thiers
refused
to
join
it
he
presided
however
that
same
evening
over
a
gathering
of
some
two
hundred
members
of
the
moribund
legislative
body
which
then
made
a
forlorn
attempt
to
retain
some
measure
of
authority
by
coming
to
some
agreement
with
the
new
government
but
jules
favre
and
jules
simon
who
attended
the
meeting
on
the
latter
behalf
would
not
entertain
the
suggestion
it
was
politely
signified
to
the
deputies
that
their
support
in
paris
was
not
required
and
that
if
they
desired
to
serve
their
country
in
any
way
they
had
better
betake
themselves
to
their
former
constituencies
in
the
provinces
so
far
as
the
legislative
body
and
the
senate
note
also
were
concerned
everything
ended
in
a
delightful
bit
of
comedy
not
only
were
the
doors
of
their
respective
meeting
halls
looked
but
they
were
secured
with
strips
of
tape
and
seals
of
red
wax
the
awe
with
which
red
inspires
frenchmen
is
distinctly
a
trait
of
the
national
character
had
there
been
however
a
real
bonaparte
in
paris
at
that
time
he
would
probably
have
cut
off
the
aforesaid
seals
with
his
sword
note
the
senate
over
which
rouher
presided
dispensed
quietly
on
hearing
of
the
invasion
of
the
chamber
the
proposal
that
it
should
adjourn
till
more
fortunate
times
emanated
from
rouher
himself
a
few
cries
of
vive
were
raised
as
the
assembly
dispersed
almost
immediately
afterwards
however
most
of
the
senators
including
rouher
who
knew
that
he
was
very
obnoxious
to
the
parisians
quitted
the
city
and
even
france
on
the
morning
of
september
the
otherwise
the
daily
parisian

out
with
a
cartoon
designed
to
sum
up
the
whole

depicted

and

and
etienne
arago
in
the
earlier
days
as
mayor
of
paris
the
new
government
was
fully
installed
by
tuesday
september
it
had
already
issued
several
more
or
less
stirring
proclamations
which
were
followed
by
a
despatch
which
jules
favre
addressed
to
the
french
diplomatic
representatives
abroad
as
a
to
the
arrival
of
a
number
of
dejected
fugitives
from
macmahon
army
whose
appearance
was
by
no
means
of
a
nature
to
exhilarate
the
parisians
the
defence
was
reinforced
by
a
large
number
of
gardes
mobiles
who
poured
into
the
city
particularly
from
brittany
trochu
native
province
and
by
a
considerable
force
of
regulars
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
commanded
by
the
veteran
general
vinoy
then
seventy
years
of
age
who
had
originally
been
despatched
to
assist
macmahon
but
having
failed
to
reach
him
before
the
disaster
of
sedan
retreated
in
good
order
on
the
capital
at
the
time
when
the
siege
actually
commenced
there
were
in
paris
about
regulars
including
all
arms
and
categories
mobile
guards
and
a
naval
contingent
of
men
that
is
a
force
of
in
addition
to
the
national
guards
who
were
about
in
number
thus
altogether
nearly
half
a
million
armed
men
were
assembled
in
paris
for
the
purpose
of
defending
it
as
all
authorities
afterwards
admitted
this
was
a
very
great
blunder
as
fully
regulars
and
mobiles
might
have
been
spared
to
advantage
for
service
in
the
provinces
of
course
the
national
guards
themselves
could
not
be
sent
away
from
the
city
though
they
were
often
an
encumbrance
rather
than
a
help
and
could
not
possibly
have
carried
on
the
work
of
defence
had
they
been
left
to
their
own
resources
besides
troops
so
long
as
the
railway
trains
continued
running
additional
military
stores
and
supplies
of
food
flour
rice
biscuits
preserved
meats
rolled
day
by
day
into
paris
at
the
same
time
several
illustrious
exiles
returned
to
the
capital
louis
blanc
and
edgar
quinet
arrived
there
after
years
of
absence
in
the
most
unostentatious
fashion
though
they
soon
succumbed
to
the
prevailing
mania
of
inditing
manifestoes
and
exhortations
for
the
benefit
of
their
victor
return
was
more
theatrical
in
those
famous
châtiments
in
which
he
had
so
severely
flagellated
the
third
napoleon
after
in
earlier
years
exalting
the
first
to
the
dignity
of
a
he
had
vowed
to
keep
out
of
france
and
to
protest
against
the
empire
so
long
as
it
lasted
penning
in
this
connection
the
famous
line
et
reste
je
serai
but
now
the
empire
had
fallen
and
so
hugo
returned
in
triumph
to
paris
when
he
alighted
from
the
train
which
brought
him
he
said
to
those
who
had
assembled
to
give
him
a
fitting
greeting
that
he
had
come
to
do
his
duty
in
the
hour
of
danger
that
duty
being
to
save
paris
which
meant
more
than
saving
france
for
it
implied
saving
the
world
itself
paris
being
the
capital
of
civilization
the
centre
of
mankind
naturally
enough
those
fine
sentiments
were
fervently
applauded
by
the
great
admirers
and
when
he
had
installed
himself
with
his
companions
in
an
open
carriage
two
or
three
thousand
people
escorted
him
processionally
along
the
boulevards
it
was
and
the
cafés
were
crowded
and
the
footways
covered
with
promenaders
as
the
went
by
the
escort
singing
now
the
marseillaise
and
now
the
chant
du
départ
whilst
on
every
side
shouts
of
vive
victor
hugo
rang
out
as
enthusiastically
as
if
the
appointed
saviour
of
paris
were
indeed
actually
passing
more
than
once
i
saw
the
illustrious
poet
stand
up
uncover
and
wave
his
hat
in
response
to
the
acclamations
and
i
then
particularly
noticed
the
loftiness
of
his
forehead
and
the
splendid
crop
of
white
hair
with
which
it
was
crowned
hugo
at
that
time
years
old
still
looked
vigorous
but
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
any
such
man
as
himself
to
save
the
city
from
what
was
impending
all
he
could
do
was
to
indite
perfervid
manifestoes
and
subsequently
in
terrible
commemorate
the
doings
and
sufferings
of
the
time
for
the
rest
he
certainly
enrolled
himself
as
a
national
guard
and
i
more
than
once
caught
sight
of
him
wearing
and
i
am
not
sure
however
whether
he
ever
did
a
it
must
have
been
on
the
day
following
victor
hugo
arrival
that
i
momentarily
quitted
paris
for
reasons
in
which
my
youthful
but
precocious
heart
was
deeply
concerned
i
was
absent
for
four
days
or
so
and
on
returning
to
the
capital
i
was
accompanied
by
my
stepmother
who
knowing
that
my
father
intended
to
remain
in
the
city
during
the
impending
siege
wished
to
be
with
him
for
a
while
before
the
investment
began
i
recollect
that
she
even
desired
to
remain
with
us
though
that
was
impossible
as
she
had
young
children
whom
she
had
left
at
saint
servan
and
besides
as
i
one
day
jocularly
remarked
to
her
she
would
by
staying
in
paris
have
added
to
the
useless
mouths
whose
numbers
the
republican
like
the
imperial
government
was
with
very
indifferent
success
striving
to
diminish
however
she
only
quitted
us
at
the
last
extremity
departing
on
the
evening
of
september
by
the
western
line
which
on
the
morrow
the
enemy
out
at
conflans
some
fourteen
miles
from
paris
day
by
day
the
parisians
had
received
news
of
the
gradual
approach
of
the
german
forces
on
the
they
heard
that
the
crown
prince
of
prussia
army
was
advancing
from
montmirail
to
coulommiers
whereupon
the
city
became
very
restless
whilst
on
the
there
came
word
that
the
black
and
white
pennons
of
the
ubiquitous
uhlans
had
been
seen
at
la
that
same
day
thiers
quitted
paris
on
a
mission
which
he
had
undertaken
for
the
new
government
that
of
pleading
the
cause
of
france
at
the
courts
of
london
petersburg
vienna
and
rome
then
on
the
there
were
tidings
that
laon
had
capitulated
though
not
without
its
defenders
blowing
up
a
and
thereby
injuring
some
german
officers
of
exalted
rank
for
which
reason
the
deed
was
enthusiastically
commended
by
the
parisian
press
though
it
would
seem
to
have
been
a
somewhat
treacherous
one
contrary
to
the
ordinary
usages
of
war
on
the
some
german
scouts
reached
meaux
and
a
larger
force
leisurely
occupied
melun
the
french
on
their
part
were
busy
after
a
fashion
they
offered
no
armed
resistance
to
the
german
advance
but
they
tried
to
impede
it
in
sundry
ways
with
the
idea
of
depriving
the
enemy
of
cover
various
attempts
were
made
to
fire
some
of
the
woods
in
the
vicinity
of
paris
whilst
in
order
to
cheat
him
of
supplies
stacks
and
standing
crops
were
here
and
there
destroyed
then
too
several
railway
and
other
bridges
were
blown
up
including
the
railway
bridge
at
creil
so
that
direct
communication
with
boulogne
and
calais
ceased
on
september
the
was
a
great
day
for
the
national
guards
who
were
then
reviewed
by
general
trochu
with
my
father
and
my
young
stepmother
i
went
to
see
the
sight
which
was
in
many
respects
an
interesting
one
a
hundred
and
battalions
or
approximately
men
of
the
citizen
soldiery
were
under
arms
their
lines
extending
first
along
the
boulevards
from
the
bastille
to
the
madeleine
then
down
the
rue
royale
across
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
up
the
champs
elysées
as
far
as
the
rond
point
in
addition
men
of
the
garde
mobile
were
assembled
along
the
quays
of
the
seine
and
up
the
champs
elysées
from
the
rond
point
to
the
arc
de
triomphe
i
have
never
since
set
eyes
on
so
large
a
force
of
armed
men
they
were
of
all
sorts
some
of
the
mobiles
notably
the
breton
ones
who
afterwards
gave
a
good
account
of
themselves
looked
really
soldierly
but
the
national
guards
were
a
strangely
mixed
lot
they
all
wore
but
quite
half
of
them
as
yet
had
no
uniforms
and
were
attired
in
blouses
and
trousers
of
various
hues
only
here
and
there
could
one
see
a
man
of
military
bearing
most
of
them
struck
attitudes
and
were
quite
unable
to
keep
step
in
marching
a
particular
feature
of
the
display
was
the
number
of
flowers
and
sprigs
of
evergreen
with
which
the
men
had
decorated
the
muzzles
of
the
which
they
mostly
carried
here
and
there
moreover
one
and
another
fellow
displayed
on
his
some
coloured
caricature
of
the
or
the
what
things
they
were
those
innumerable
caricatures
of
the
months
which
followed
the
revolution
now
and
again
there
appeared
one
which
was
really
clever
which
embodied
a
smart
a
witty
idea
but
how
many
of
them
were
simply
the
outcome
of
a
depraved
a
lewd
a
bestial
imagination
the
most
offensive
caricatures
of
were
as
nothing
beside
those
levelled
at
that
unfortunate
woman
the
empress
eugénie
our
last
days
of
liberty
were
now
slipping
by
some
of
the
poorest
folk
of
the
environs
of
paris
were
at
last
coming
into
the
city
bringing
their
chattels
with
them
strange
ideas
however
had
taken
hold
of
some
of
the
more
suburban
bourgeois
departing
hastily
into
the
provinces
so
as
to
place
their
skins
out
of
harm
reach
they
had
not
troubled
to
store
their
household
goods
in
the
city
but
had
left
them
in
their
coquettish
villas
and
pavilions
the
doors
of
which
were
barely
looked
the
german
soldiers
would
very
likely
occupy
the
houses
but
assuredly
they
would
do
no
harm
to
them
perhaps
however
it
might
be
as
well
to
propitiate
the
foreign
soldiers
let
us
leave
something
for
them
said
worthy
monsieur
durand
to
madame
durand
his
wife
they
will
be
hungry
when
they
get
here
and
if
they
find
something
ready
for
them
they
will
be
grateful
and
do
no
damage
so
although
the
honest
durands
carefully
barred
at
times
even
their
cellars
of
choice
wines
they
arranged
that
plenty
of
bottles
at
times
even
a
cask
of
should
be
within
easy
access
and
ham
cheese
sardines
de
and
de
foie
were
deposited
in
the
pantry
cupboards
which
were
considerately
left
unlocked
in
order
that
the
good
honest
germans
who
according
to
a
proclamation
issued
by
unser
fritz
at
an
earlier
stage
of
the
hostilities
made
war
on
the
emperor
napoleon
and
not
on
the
french
nation
might
regale
themselves
without
let
or
hindrance
moreover
the
nights
were
drawing
in
the
evenings
becoming
chilly
so
why
not
lay
the
fires
and
place
matches
and
candles
in
convenient
places
for
the
benefit
of
the
unbidden
guests
who
would
so
soon
arrive
all
those
things
being
done
and
mme
durand
departed
to
seek
the
quietude
of
never
dreaming
that
on
their
return
to
montfermeil
palaiseau
or
sartrouville
they
would
find
their
converted
into
a
pigstye
their
furniture
smashed
and
their
clocks
and
abstracted
of
course
the
durand
of
knows
what
happened
to
his
respected
parents
he
knows
what
to
think
of
the
good
honest
considerate
german
soldiery
and
if
he
can
help
it
he
will
not
in
any
similar
case
leave
so
much
as
a
wooden
spoon
to
be
carried
off
to
the
fatherland
and
added
as
yet
another
trophy
to
the
hundred
thousand
french
clocks
and
the
million
french
which
are
still
preserved
there
as
mementoes
of
the
grosse
zeit
on
september
we
heard
of
some
petty
skirmishes
between
uhlans
and
in
the
vicinity
of
montereau
and
melun
on
the
morrow
the
enemy
captured
a
train
at
senlis
and
fired
on
another
near
chantilly
fortunately
without
wounding
any
of
the
passengers
whilst
on
the
same
day
his
presence
was
signalled
at
only
ten
miles
south
of
paris
that
evening
moreover
he
attempted
to
ford
the
seine
at
juvisy
on
the
some
of
his
forces
appeared
between
créteil
and
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
city
and
only
some
five
miles
from
the
fort
of
vincennes
then
we
again
heard
of
him
on
the
south
of
his
presence
at
brunoy
ablon
and
athis
and
of
the
pontoons
by
which
he
was
crossing
the
seine
at
villeneuve
and
thus
the
advance
steadily
continued
quite
unchecked
by
force
of
arms
save
for
just
a
few
trifling
skirmishes
initiated
by
sundry
not
a
road
not
a
barricade
was
defended
by
the
authorities
not
once
was
the
passage
of
a
river
contested
here
and
there
the
germans
found
obstructions
poplars
had
been
felled
and
laid
across
a
highway
bridges
and
railway
tunnels
had
occasionally
been
blown
up
but
all
such
impediments
to
their
advance
were
speedily
overcome
by
the
enemy
who
marched
on
quietly
feeling
alternately
puzzled
and
astonished
at
never
being
confronted
by
any
french
forces
as
the
invaders
drew
nearer
to
paris
they
found
an
abundance
of
vegetables
and
fruit
at
their
disposal
but
most
of
the
peasantry
had
fled
taking
their
live
stock
with
them
and
as
a
german
officer
told
me
in
after
years
eggs
cheese
butter
and
milk
could
seldom
be
procured
on
the
the
french
began
to
recover
from
the
stupor
which
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
them
old
general
vinoy
crossed
the
marne
at
charenton
with
some
of
his
forces
and
a
rather
sharp
skirmish
ensued
in
front
of
the
village
of
mesly
that
same
day
lord
lyons
the
british
ambassador
took
his
departure
from
paris
proceeding
by
devious
ways
to
tours
whither
a
couple
of
days
previously
three
delegates
of
the
national
defence
two
septuagenarians
and
one
sexagenarian
crémieux
and
fourichon
had
repaired
in
order
to
take
over
the
general
government
of
france
lord
lyons
had
previously
told
jules
favre
that
he
intended
to
remain
in
the
capital
but
i
believe
that
his
decision
was
modified
by
instructions
from
london
with
him
went
most
of
the
embassy
staff
british
interests
in
paris
remaining
in
the
hands
of
the
second
secretary
wodehouse
and
the
the
consul
himself
had
very
prudently
quitted
paris
in
order
to
drink
the
waters
some
time
previously
colonel
claremont
the
military
attaché
still
remained
with
us
but
by
degrees
as
the
siege
went
on
the
embassy
staff
dwindled
down
to
the
concierge
and
two
or
was
it
four
sheep
browsing
on
the
lawn
wodehouse
went
off
my
father
and
myself
being
among
those
who
accompanied
him
as
i
shall
relate
in
a
future
chapter
towards
the
middle
of
november
and
before
the
bombardment
began
colonel
claremont
likewise
executed
a
strategical
retreat
nevertheless
or
should
i
say
for
that
very
reason
he
was
subsequently
made
a
general
officer
a
day
or
two
before
lord
lyons
left
he
drew
up
a
notice
warning
british
subjects
that
if
they
should
remain
in
paris
it
would
be
at
their
own
risk
and
peril
the
british
colony
was
not
then
so
large
as
it
is
now
nevertheless
it
was
a
considerable
one
a
good
many
members
of
it
undoubtedly
departed
on
their
own
initiative
few
if
any
saw
lord
lyons
notice
for
it
was
purely
and
simply
conveyed
to
them
through
the
medium
of
which
though
it
was
patronized
by
tourists
staying
at
the
hotels
was
seldom
seen
by
genuine
british
residents
most
of
whom
read
london
newspapers
the
morrow
of
lord
lyons
departure
sunday
september
was
our
last
day
of
liberty
the
weather
was
splendid
the
temperature
as
warm
as
that
of
june
all
paris
was
out
of
doors
we
were
not
without
and
children
not
only
were
there
the
wives
and
offspring
of
the
but
the
better
halves
of
many
tradespeople
and
bourgeois
had
remained
in
the
city
together
with
a
good
many
ladies
of
higher
social
rank
thus
in
spite
of
all
the
departures
papa
mamma
and
baby
were
still
to
be
met
in
many
directions
on
that
last
day
preceding
the
investment
there
were
gay
crowds
everywhere
on
the
boulevards
on
the
squares
along
the
quays
and
along
the
roads
skirting
the
ramparts
these
last
were
the
great
attraction
and
thousands
of
people
strolled
about
watching
the
work
which
was
in
progress
stone
casements
were
being
roofed
with
earth
platforms
were
being
prepared
for
guns
gabions
were
being
set
in
position
at
the
embrasures
sandbags
were
being
carried
to
the
parapets
stakes
were
being
pointed
for
the
many
and
smooth
earthworks
were
being
planted
with
an
infinity
of
spikes
some
guns
were
already
in
position
others
big
naval
guns
from
brest
or
cherbourg
were
still
lying
on
the
turf
meanwhile
at
the
various
city
gates
the
very
last
vehicles
laden
with
furniture
and
forage
were
arriving
from
the
suburbs
and
up
and
down
went
all
the
promenaders
chatting
laughing
examining
this
and
that
work
of
defence
or
engine
of
destruction
in
such
a
way
that
the
whole
seemed
to
be
a
vast
fair
held
solely
for
the
amusement
of
the
most
volatile
people
that
the
world
has
ever
known
access
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
was
forbidden
acres
of
timber
had
already
been
felled
there
and
from
the
open
spaces
the
mild
september
breeze
occasionally
wafted
the
lowing
of
cattle
the
bleating
of
sheep
and
the
grunting
of
pigs
our
live
stock
consisted
of
oxen
sheep
pigs
and
little
did
we
think
how
soon
those
animals
apart
from
the
would
be
consumed
few
of
us
were
aware
that
according
to
maxime
ducamp
great
work
on
paris
we
had
hitherto
consumed
on
an
average
every
day
of
the
year
oxen
sheep
pigs
and
calves
to
say
nothing
of
head
of
poultry
game
tons
of
fish
and
eggs
turning
from
the
bois
de
boulogne
which
had
become
our
principal
ranch
and
one
found
companies
of
national
guards
learning
the
in
the
champs
elysées
and
the
regulars
were
appropriately
encamped
both
in
the
avenue
de
la
grande
armée
and
on
the
champ
de
mars
and
caissons
filled
the
tuileries
garden
whilst
in
the
grounds
of
the
luxembourg
palace
one
again
found
cattle
and
sheep
yet
other
members
of
the
bovine
and
ovine
species
being
installed
singularly
enough
almost
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
hungry
wild
beasts
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
whose
mouths
fairly
watered
at
the
sight
of
their
natural
prey
if
you
followed
the
quays
of
the
seine
you
there
found
sightseers
gazing
at
the
little
gunboats
and
floating
batteries
on
the
water
and
if
you
climbed
to
montmartre
you
there
came
upon
people
watching
the
neptune
the
captive
balloon
which
nadar
the
aeronaut
and
photographer
had
already
provided
for
purposes
of
military
observation
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
of
him
and
his
balloons
again
among
all
that
i
myself
saw
on
that
memorable
sunday
i
was
perhaps
most
struck
by
the
solemn
celebration
of
mass
in
front
of
the
statue
of
strasbourg
on
the
place
de
la
concorde
the
capital
of
alsace
had
been
besieged
since
the
middle
of
august
but
was
still
offering
a
firm
resistance
to
the
enemy
its
chief
defenders
general
uhrich
and
edmond
valentin
were
the
most
popular
heroes
of
the
hour
the
latter
had
been
appointed
prefect
of
the
city
by
the
government
of
national
defence
and
resolving
to
reach
his
post
in
spite
of
the
siege
which
was
being
actively
prosecuted
had
disguised
himself
and
passed
successfully
through
the
german
lines
escaping
the
shots
which
were
fired
at
him
in
paris
the
statue
of
strasbourg
had
become
a
place
of
pilgrimage
a
sacred
shrine
as
it
were
adorned
with
banners
and
with
wreaths
innumerable
yet
i
certainly
had
not
expected
to
see
an
altar
set
up
and
mass
celebrated
in
front
of
it
as
if
it
had
been
indeed
a
statue
of
the
blessed
virgin
at
this
stage
of
affairs
there
was
no
general
hostility
to
the
church
in
paris
the
i
speak
of
its
masculine
element
was
as
sceptical
then
as
it
is
now
but
it
knew
that
general
trochu
in
whom
it
placed
its
trust
was
a
practising
and
fervent
catholic
and
that
in
taking
the
presidency
of
the
government
he
had
made
it
one
of
his
conditions
that
religion
should
be
respected
such
animosity
as
was
shown
against
the
priesthood
emanated
from
some
of
the
public
clubs
where
the
future
communards
perorated
it
was
only
as
time
went
on
and
the
defence
grew
more
and
more
hopeless
that
trochu
himself
was
denounced
as
a
and
a
de
and
not
until
the
commune
did
the
extremists
give
full
rein
to
their
hatred
of
the
church
and
its
ministers
in
connection
with
religion
there
was
another
sight
which
impressed
me
on
that
same
sunday
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
place
de
la
concorde
when
a
large
body
of
mobiles
debouched
either
from
the
rue
royale
or
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
i
noticed
with
some
astonishment
that
not
only
were
they
accompanied
by
their
chaplains
but
that
they
bore
aloft
several
processional
religious
banners
they
were
bretons
and
had
been
to
mass
i
ascertained
at
the
church
of
notre
dame
des
victoires
the
favourite
church
of
the
empress
eugénie
who
often
attended
early
mass
there
and
were
now
returning
to
their
quarters
in
the
arches
of
the
railway
viaduct
of
the
many
people
uncovered
as
they
thus
went
by
processionally
carrying
on
high
their
banners
of
the
virgin
she
who
is
invoked
by
the
catholic
soldier
as
auzilium
christianorum
for
a
moment
my
thoughts
strayed
back
to
brittany
where
during
my
holidays
the
previous
year
i
had
witnessed
the
pardon
of
guingamp
in
the
evening
i
went
to
the
boulevards
with
my
father
and
we
afterwards
dropped
into
one
or
two
of
the
public
clubs
the
boulevard
promenaders
had
a
good
deal
to
talk
about
general
ambert
who
under
the
empire
had
been
mayor
of
our
arrondissement
had
fallen
out
with
his
men
through
speaking
contemptuously
of
the
republic
and
after
being
summarily
arrested
by
some
of
them
had
been
deprived
of
his
command
further
the
had
published
a
circular
addressed
by
bismarck
to
the
german
diplomatists
abroad
in
which
he
stated
formally
that
if
france
desired
peace
she
would
have
to
give
material
guarantees
that
idea
however
was
vigorously
by
the
boulevardiers
particularly
as
rumours
of
sudden
french
successes
originating
nobody
knew
how
were
once
more
in
the
air
scandal
however
secured
the
attention
of
many
of
the
people
seated
in
the
cafés
for
the
victor
hugo
organ
had
that
day
printed
a
letter
addressed
to
napoleon
iii
by
his
mistress
marguerite
bellenger
who
admitted
in
it
that
she
had
deceived
her
imperial
lover
with
respect
to
the
paternity
of
her
child
however
we
went
my
father
and
i
from
the
boulevards
to
the
which
had
been
turned
for
the
time
into
a
public
club
and
there
we
listened
awhile
to
citizen
lermina
who
taking
thiers
mission
and
bismarck
despatch
as
his
text
protested
against
france
concluding
any
peace
or
even
any
armistice
so
long
as
the
germans
had
not
withdrawn
across
the
frontier
there
was
still
no
little
talk
of
that
description
the
old
agitator
auguste
blanqui
long
confined
in
one
of
the
cages
of
mont
but
now
once
more
in
paris
never
wearied
of
opposing
peace
in
the
discourses
that
he
delivered
at
his
own
particular
club
which
like
the
newspaper
he
inspired
was
called
la
patrie
en
danger
in
other
directions
for
instance
at
the
club
du
maine
the
extremists
were
already
attacking
the
new
government
for
its
delay
in
distributing
cartridges
to
the
national
guards
being
no
doubt
already
impatient
to
seize
authority
themselves
whilst
other
people
were
promenading
or
perorating
trochu
in
his
room
at
the
louvre
was
receiving
telegram
after
telegram
informing
him
that
the
germans
were
now
fast
closing
round
the
city
he
himself
it
appears
had
no
idea
of
preventing
it
but
at
the
urgent
suggestion
of
his
old
friend
and
comrade
general
ducrot
he
had
consented
that
an
effort
should
be
made
to
delay
at
any
rate
a
complete
investment
in
an
earlier
chapter
i
had
occasion
to
mention
ducrot
in
connexion
with
the
warnings
which
napoleon
iii
received
respecting
the
military
preparations
of
prussia
at
this
time
the
general
was
years
old
and
therefore
still
in
his
prime
as
commander
of
a
part
of
macmahon
forces
he
had
distinguished
himself
at
the
battle
of
wörth
and
when
the
marshal
was
wounded
at
sedan
it
was
he
who
by
right
of
seniority
at
first
assumed
command
of
the
army
being
afterwards
compelled
however
to
relinquish
the
poet
to
wimpfen
in
accordance
with
an
order
from
palikao
which
wimpfen
produced
included
at
the
capitulation
among
the
prisoners
taken
by
the
germans
ducrot
subsequently
escaped
the
germans
contending
that
he
had
broken
his
parole
in
doing
so
though
this
does
not
appear
to
have
been
the
case
immediately
afterwards
he
repaired
to
paris
to
place
himself
at
trochu
disposal
at
wörth
he
had
suggested
certain
tactics
which
might
have
benefited
the
french
army
at
sedan
he
had
wished
to
make
a
supreme
effort
to
cut
through
the
german
lines
and
now
in
paris
he
proposed
to
trochu
a
plan
which
if
successful
might
he
thought
retard
the
investment
and
momentarily
cut
the
german
forces
in
halves
in
attempting
to
carry
out
this
scheme
september
ducrot
took
with
him
most
of
vinoy
corps
that
is
four
divisions
of
infantry
some
cavalry
and
no
little
artillery
having
indeed
according
to
his
own
account
guns
with
him
the
action
was
fought
on
the
plateau
of
châtillon
south
of
paris
where
the
french
had
been
constructing
a
redoubt
which
was
still
however
in
a
very
unfinished
state
at
daybreak
that
morning
all
the
districts
of
paris
lying
on
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
were
roused
by
the
loud
booming
of
guns
the
noise
was
at
times
almost
deafening
and
it
is
certain
that
the
french
fired
a
vast
number
of
projectiles
though
assuredly
the
number
given
in
a
copy
of
the
official
report
which
i
have
before
me
must
be
a
clerical
error
in
any
case
the
germans
replied
with
an
even
more
terrific
fire
than
that
of
the
french
and
as
had
previously
happened
at
sedan
and
elsewhere
the
french
ordnance
proved
to
be
no
match
for
that
emanating
from
krupp
renowned
workshops
the
french
defeat
was
however
precipitated
by
a
sudden
panic
which
arose
among
a
provisional
regiment
of
zouaves
who
suddenly
turned
tail
and
fled
panic
is
often
if
not
always
contagious
and
so
it
proved
to
be
on
this
occasion
though
some
of
the
gardes
mobiles
notably
the
bretons
of
fought
well
thanks
to
the
support
of
the
artillery
which
is
so
essential
in
the
case
of
untried
troops
other
men
weakened
and
imitated
the
example
of
the
zouaves
duorot
soon
realized
that
it
was
useless
to
prolong
the
encounter
and
after
spiking
the
guns
set
up
in
the
châtillon
redoubt
he
retired
under
the
protection
of
the
forts
of
vanves
and
montrouge
my
father
and
i
had
hastened
to
the
southern
side
of
paris
as
soon
as
the
cannonade
apprised
us
that
an
engagement
was
going
on
pitiful
was
the
spectacle
presented
by
the
disbanded
soldiers
as
they
rushed
down
the
chaussée
du
maine
many
had
flung
away
their
weapons
some
went
on
dejectedly
others
burst
into
demanded
drink
with
threats
and
presently
emerged
swearing
cursing
and
shouting
nous
sommes
trahis
riderless
horses
went
by
instinctively
following
the
men
and
here
and
there
one
saw
a
bewildered
and
indignant
officer
whose
orders
were
scouted
with
jeers
the
whole
scene
was
of
evil
augury
for
the
defence
of
paris
at
a
later
hour
when
we
reached
the
boulevards
we
found
the
wildest
rumours
in
circulation
there
nobody
knew
exactly
what
had
happened
but
there
was
talk
of
french
troops
having
been
annihilated
by
five
times
that
number
of
germans
at
last
a
proclamation
emanating
from
gambetta
was
posted
up
and
eagerly
perused
it
supplied
no
details
of
the
fighting
but
urged
the
parisians
to
give
way
neither
to
excitement
nor
to
despondency
and
reminded
them
that
a
had
been
instituted
to
deal
with
cowards
and
deserters
thereupon
the
excitement
seemed
to
subside
and
people
went
to
dinner
an
hour
afterwards
the
boulevards
were
as
gay
as
ever
thronged
once
more
with
promenaders
among
whom
were
many
officers
of
the
garde
mobile
and
the
usual
regiment
of
painted
women
cynicism
and
frivolity
were
once
more
the
order
of
the
day
but
in
the
midst
of
it
there
came
an
unexpected
incident
some
of
the
national
guards
of
the
district
were
not
unnaturally
disgusted
by
the
spectacle
which
the
boulevards
presented
only
a
few
hours
after
misfortune
had
fallen
on
the
french
arms
forming
therefore
into
a
body
they
marched
along
loudly
calling
upon
the
cafés
to
close
particularly
were
they
indignant
when
on
reaching
brébant
restaurant
at
the
corner
of
the
faubourg
montmartre
they
heard
somebody
playing
a
lively
offenbachian
air
on
a
piano
there
a
party
of
heedless
and
of
the
were
enjoying
themselves
together
as
in
the
palmy
imperial
days
but
the
piano
was
soon
silenced
the
cafés
and
restaurants
were
compelled
to
close
and
the
boulevardian
world
went
home
in
a
slightly
chastened
mood

was
at

on
the
afternoon
of

that
the
telegraph
wires
between
paris
and
versailles
the
last
which
linked
us
to
the
outside
world
were
suddenly
cut
by
the
enemy
the
town
so
closely
associated
with
the
grand
monarque
and
his
magnificence
having
then
surrendered
to
a
very
small
force
of
germans
although
it
had
a
couple
of
thousand
men
mobile
and
national
guards
to
defend
it
the
capitulation
which
was
arranged
between
the
mayor
and
the
enemy
was
flagrantly
violated
by
the
latter
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
been
concluded
tins
being
only
one
of
many
such
instances
which
occurred
during
the
war
versailles
was
required
to
provide
the
invader
with
a
number
of
oxen
to
be
slaughtered
for
food
numerous
casks
of
wine
the
purpose
of
which
was
obvious
and
a
large
supply
of
forage
valued
at
after
all
however
that
was
a
mere
trifle
in
comparison
with
what
the
present
kaiser
forces
would
probably
demand
on
landing
at
hull
or
grimsby
or
harwich
should
they
some
day
do
so
by
the
terms
of
the
surrender
of
versailles
however
the
local
national
guards
were
to
have
remained
armed
and
entrusted
with
the
internal
police
of
the
town
and
moreover
there
were
to
have
been
no
further
requisitions
but
bismarck
and
moltke
all
such
stipulations
and
the
versaillese
had
to
submit
to
many
indignities
in
paris
that
day
the
national
defence
government
was
busy
in
various
ways
first
in
imposing
fines
according
to
an
ascending
scale
on
all
absentees
who
ought
to
have
remained
in
the
city
and
taken
their
share
of
military
duty
and
secondly
in
decreeing
that
nobody
with
any
money
lodged
in
the
savings
bank
should
be
entitled
to
draw
out
more
than
fifty
francs
otherwise
two
pounds
leaving
the
entire
balance
of
his
or
her
deposit
at
the
government
disposal
this
measure
provoked
no
little
dissatisfaction
it
was
also
on
september
the
first
day
of
the
siege
that
the
last
diplomatic
courier
entered
paris
i
well
remember
the
incident
whilst
i
was
walking
along
the
faubourg
saint
honoré
i
suddenly
perceived
an
open
drawn
by
a
pair
of
horses
bestriding
one
of
which
was
a
postillion
arrayed
in
the
traditional
costume
hair
à
la
catogan
jacket
with
scarlet
facings
hat
huge
boots
and
all
the
other
appurtenances
which
one
saw
during
long
years
on
the
stage
in
adolphe
adam
sprightly
but
impossible
le
postillon
de
longjumeau
for
an
instant
indeed
i
felt
inclined
to
hum
the
famous
refrain
oh
oh
oh
oh
était
beau
but
many
national
guards
and
others
regarded
the
equipage
with
great
suspicion
particularly
as
it
was
occupied
by
on
individual
in
attire
quite
a
number
of
people
decided
in
their
own
minds
that
this
personage
must
be
a
prussian
spy
and
therefore
desired
to
stop
his
carriage
and
march
him
off
to
prison
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
he
was
a
british
officer
captain
johnson
discharging
the
duties
of
a
queen
messenger
and
as
he
repeatedly
flourished
a
cane
in
a
very
menacing
manner
and
the
of
the
british
embassy
a
german
i
believe
energetically
came
to
his
assistance
he
escaped
actual
molestation
and
drove
in
triumph
into
the
courtyard
of
the
ambassadorial
mansion
at
this
time
a
great
shock
was
awaiting
the
parisians
during
the
same
week
the
vicomtesse
de
renneville
issued
an
announcement
stating
that
in
presence
of
the
events
which
were
occurring
she
was
constrained
to
suspend
the
publication
of
her
renowned
journal
of
fashions
gazette
this
was
a
tragic
blow
both
for
the
parisians
themselves
and
for
all
the
world
beyond
them
there
would
be
no
more
paris
fashions
to
what
despair
would
not
millions
of
women
be
reduced
how
would
they
dress
even
supposing
that
they
should
contrive
to
dress
at
all
the
thought
was
appalling
and
as
one
and
another
great
closed
his
doors
paris
began
to
realize
that
her
prestige
was
indeed
in
jeopardy
a
day
or
two
after
the
investment
the
city
became
very
restless
on
account
of
thiers
mission
to
foreign
courts
and
jules
favre
visit
to
the
german
headquarters
it
being
reported
by
the
extremists
that
the
government
did
not
intend
to
be
a
government
of
national
defence
but
one
of
capitulation
in
reply
to
those
rumours
the
authorities
issued
the
famous
proclamation
in
which
they
said
the
government
policy
is
that
formulated
in
these
terms
not
an
inch
of
our
territory
not
a
stone
of
our
fortresses
the
government
will
maintain
it
to
the
end
on
the
morrow
september
gambetta
personally
reminded
us
that
it
was
the
anniversary
of
the
foundation
of
the
first
french
republic
and
after
recalling
to
the
parisians
what
their
fathers
had
then
accomplished
he
exhorted
them
to
follow
that
illustrious
example
and
to
secure
victory
by
confronting
death
that
same
evening
the
clubs
decided
that
a
great
demonstration
should
be
made
on
the
morrow
by
way
of
insisting
that
no
treaty
should
be
discussed
until
the
germans
had
been
driven
out
of
france
that
no
territory
fort
vessel
or
treasure
should
be
surrendered
that
all
elections
should
be
adjourned
and
that
a
en
should
be
decreed
jules
favre
responded
that
he
and
his
colleagues
personified
defence
and
not
surrender
and
rochefort
poor
rochefort
solemnly
promised
that
the
barricades
of
paris
should
be
begun
that
very
night
that
undertaking
mightily
pleased
the
agitators
though
the
use
of
the
said
barricades
was
not
apparent
and
the
demonstrators
dispersed
with
the
usual
shouts
of
vive
la
république
mort
aux
prussiens
in
connexion
with
that
last
cry
it
was
a
curious
circumstance
that
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
war
the
french
persistently
ignored
the
presence
of
saxons
würtembergers
hessians
badeners
and
so
forth
in
the
invading
armies
moreover
on
only
one
or
two
occasions
such
as
the
bazeilles
episode
of
the
battle
of
sedan
did
they
evince
any
particular
animosity
against
the
bavarians
i
must
have
heard
death
to
the
prussians
shouted
at
least
a
thousand
times
but
most
certainly
i
never
once
heard
a
single
cry
of
death
to
the
germans
still
in
the
same
connexion
let
me
mention
that
it
was
in
paris
during
the
siege
that
the
eminent
naturalist
and
biologist
quatrefages
de
bréau
wrote
that
curious
little
book
of
his
la
race
prussienne
in
which
he
contended
that
the
prussians
were
not
germans
at
all
there
was
at
least
some
measure
of
truth
in
the
views
which
he
enunciated
as
i
previously
indicated
jules
favre
the
foreign
minister
of
the
national
defence
had
gone
to
the
german
headquarters
in
order
to
discuss
the
position
with
prince
then
count
bismarck
he
met
him
twice
first
at
the
comte
de
rillac
château
de
la
haute
maison
and
secondly
at
baron
de
rothschild
château
de
ferrières
the
german
staff
usually
installing
itself
in
the
lordly
of
the
french
noble
or
financial
aristocracy
and
leaving
them
as
dirty
as
possible
and
naturally
bereft
of
their
timepieces
baron
alphonse
de
rothschild
told
me
in
later
years
that
sixteen
clocks
were
carried
off
from
ferrières
whilst
king
afterwards
the
emperor
william
and
bismarck
were
staying
there
i
presume
that
they
now
decorate
some
of
the
salons
of
the
schloss
at
berlin
or
possibly
those
of
varzin
and
friedrichsruhe
bismarck
personally
had
an
inordinate
passion
for
clocks
as
all
who
ever
visited
his
quarters
in
the
wilhelmstrasse
when
he
was
german
chancellor
will
well
remember
but
he
was
not
content
with
the
clocks
of
ferrières
he
told
jules
favre
that
if
france
desired
peace
she
must
surrender
the
two
departments
of
the
upper
and
the
lower
rhine
a
part
of
the
department
of
the
moselle
together
with
metz
chateau
salins
and
soissons
and
he
would
only
grant
an
armistice
to
allow
of
the
election
of
a
french
national
assembly
to
decide
the
question
of
war
or
peace
on
condition
that
the
germans
should
occupy
strasbourg
toul
and
phalsburg
together
with
a
fortress
such
as
mont
valerien
commanding
the
city
of
paris
such
conditions
naturally
stiffened
the
backs
of
the
french
and
for
a
time
there
was
no
more
talk
of
negotiating
during
the
earlier
days
of
the
siege
of
paris
i
came
into
contact
with
various
english
people
who
having
delayed
their
departure
until
it
was
too
late
found
themselves
shut
up
in
the
city
and
were
particularly
anxious
to
depart
from
it
the
british
embassy
gave
them
no
help
in
the
matter
having
issued
its
paltry
notice
in
it
considered
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
it
to
do
anything
further
moreover
great
britain
had
not
recognized
the
french
republic
so
that
the
position
of
wodehouse
was
a
somewhat
difficult
one
however
a
few
imprisoned
englishmen
endeavoured
to
escape
from
the
city
by
devices
of
their
own
two
of
them
who
set
out
together
fully
expecting
to
get
through
the
german
lines
and
then
reach
a
convenient
railway
station
followed
the
course
of
the
seine
for
several
miles
without
being
able
to
cross
it
and
in
spite
of
their
waving
otherwise
flags
of
truce
and
their
constant
shouts
of
english
friends
and
so
forth
were
repeatedly
fired
at
by
both
french
and
german
outposts
at
last
they
reached
rueil
where
the
villagers
on
noticing
how
bad
their
french
was
took
them
to
be
prussian
spies
and
nearly
lynched
them
fortunately
the
local
commissary
of
police
believed
their
story
and
they
were
sent
back
to
paris
to
face
the
horseflesh
and
the
many
other
hardships
which
they
had
particularly
desired
to
avoid
i
also
remember
the
representative
of
a
birmingham
factory
telling
me
of
his
unsuccessful
attempt
to
escape
he
had
lingered
in
paris
in
the
hope
of
concluding
a
contract
with
the
new
republican
government
not
having
sufficient
money
to
charter
a
balloon
and
the
embassy
as
usual
at
that
time
refusing
any
help
o
shades
of
palmerston
he
set
out
as
on
a
with
a
knapsack
strapped
to
his
shoulders
and
an
umbrella
in
his
hand
his
hope
was
to
cross
the
seine
by
the
bridge
of
saint
cloud
or
that
of
suresnes
but
he
failed
in
both
attempts
and
was
repeatedly
fired
upon
by
vigilant
french
outposts
after
losing
his
way
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
awakening
both
the
cattle
and
the
sheep
there
in
the
course
of
his
nightly
ramble
he
at
last
found
one
of
the
little
huts
erected
to
shelter
the
gardeners
and
and
remained
there
until
daybreak
when
he
was
able
to
take
his
bearings
and
proceed
towards
the
auteuil
gate
of
the
ramparts
as
he
did
not
wish
to
be
fired
upon
again
he
deemed
it
expedient
to
hoist
his
pocket
handkerchief
at
the
end
of
his
umbrella
as
a
sign
of
his
pacific
intentions
and
finding
the
gate
open
and
the
drawbridge
down
he
attempted
to
enter
the
city
but
was
immediately
challenged
by
the
national
guards
on
duty
these
vigilant
patriots
observed
his
muddy
condition
the
previous
day
had
been
a
wet
one
and
suspiciously
inquired
where
he
had
come
from
at
that
early
hour
his
answer
being
given
in
broken
french
and
in
a
very
embarrassed
manner
he
was
at
once
regarded
as
a
prussian
spy
and
dragged
off
to
the
there
he
was
carefully
searched
and
everything
in
his
pockets
having
been
taken
from
him
including
a
small
bottle
which
the
sergeant
on
duty
regarded
with
grave
suspicion
he
was
told
that
his
would
be
decided
when
the
commanding
officer
of
that
particular
of
the
ramparts
made
his
rounds
when
this
officer
arrived
he
closely
questioned
the
prisoner
who
tried
to
explain
his
circumstances
and
protested
that
his
innocence
was
shown
by
the
british
passport
and
other
papers
which
had
been
taken
from
him
oh
papers
prove
nothing
was
the
prompt
retort
spies
are
always
provided
with
papers
but
come
i
have
proof
that
you
are
an
unmitigated
villain
so
saying
the
officer
produced
the
small
bottle
which
had
been
taken
from
the
unfortunate
traveller
and
added
you
see
this
you
had
it
in
your
pocket
now
do
attempt
to
deceive
me
for
i
know
very
well
what
is
the
nature
of
the
green
liquid
which
it
contains
it
is
a
combustible
fluid
with
which
you
wanted
to
set
fire
to
our
denials
and
protests
were
in
vain
the
officer
refused
to
listen
to
his
prisoner
until
the
latter
at
last
offered
to
drink
some
of
the
terrible
fluid
in
order
to
prove
that
it
was
not
at
all
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
with
a
little
difficulty
the
cork
was
removed
from
the
flask
and
on
the
latter
being
handed
to
the
prisoner
he
proceeded
to
imbibe
some
of
its
contents
the
officer
meanwhile
retiring
to
a
short
distance
as
if
he
imagined
that
the
alleged
spy
would
suddenly
explode
nothing
of
that
kind
happened
however
indeed
the
prisoner
drank
the
terrible
stuff
with
relish
smacked
his
lips
and
even
prepared
to
take
a
second
draught
when
the
officer
feeling
reassured
again
drew
near
to
him
and
expressed
his
willingness
to
sample
the
suspected
fluid
himself
he
did
so
and
at
once
discovered
that
it
was
purely
and
simply
some
authentic
chartreuse
verte
it
did
not
take
the
pair
of
them
long
to
exhaust
this
supply
of
the
of
bruno
and
as
soon
as
this
was
done
the
prisoner
was
set
at
liberty
with
profuse
apologies
now
and
again
some
of
those
who
attempted
to
leave
the
beleaguered
city
succeeded
in
their
attempt
in
one
instance
a
party
of
four
or
five
englishmen
ran
the
blockade
in
the
traditional
carriage
and
pair
they
had
been
staying
at
the
grand
hotel
where
another
seven
or
eight
visitors
including
labouchere
still
remained
together
with
about
the
same
number
of
servants
to
wait
upon
them
the
famous
caravanserai
then
undoubtedly
the
largest
in
paris
being
otherwise
quite
untenanted
the
carriage
in
which
the
party
i
have
mentioned
took
their
departure
was
driven
by
an
old
english
jockey
named
tommy
webb
who
had
been
in
france
for
nearly
half
a
century
and
had
ridden
the
winners
of
some
of
the
very
first
races
started
by
the
french
jockey
club
misfortune
had
overtaken
him
however
in
his
declining
years
and
he
had
become
a
mere
parisian
cabby
the
party
sallied
forth
from
the
courtyard
of
the
grand
hotel
taking
with
it
several
huge
hampers
of
provisions
and
a
quantity
of
other
luggage
and
all
the
participants
in
the
attempt
seemed
to
be
quite
confident
of
success
but
a
few
hours
later
they
returned
in
sore
disappointment
having
been
stopped
near
neuilly
by
the
french
outposts
as
they
were
unprovided
with
any
official
a
document
of
that
description
having
been
obtained
however
from
general
trochu
on
the
morrow
a
second
attempt
was
made
and
this
time
the
party
speedily
passed
through
the
french
lines
but
in
trying
to
penetrate
those
of
the
enemy
some
melodramatic
adventures
occurred
it
became
necessary
indeed
to
dodge
both
the
bullets
of
the
germans
and
those
of
the
french
who
paid
not
the
slightest
respect
either
to
the
union
jack
or
to
the
large
white
flag
which
were
displayed
on
either
side
of
tommy
webb
at
last
after
a
variety
of
mishaps
the
party
succeeded
in
parleying
with
a
german
cavalry
officer
and
after
they
had
addressed
a
written
appeal
to
the
crown
prince
of
prussia
who
was
pleased
to
grant
it
they
were
taken
blindfolded
to
versailles
where
blumenthal
the
crown
prince
chief
of
staff
asked
them
for
information
respecting
the
actual
state
of
paris
and
then
allowed
them
to
proceed
on
their
way
captain
johnson
the
queen
messenger
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
also
contrived
to
quit
paris
again
but
the
germans
placed
him
under
strict
surveillance
and
blumenthal
told
him
that
no
more
queen
messengers
would
be
allowed
to
pass
through
the
german
lines
about
this
same
time
however
the
english
of
one
of
trochu
contrived
not
only
to
reach
saint
where
his
family
was
residing
but
also
to
return
to
paris
with
messages
this
young
fellow
had
cleverly
disguised
himself
as
a
french
peasant
and
on
the
prefect
of
police
hearing
of
his
adventures
he
sent
out
several
detectives
in
similar
disguises
with
instructions
to
ascertain
all
they
could
about
the
enemy
and
report
the
same
to
him
meantime
the
paris
post
office
was
endeavouring
to
send
out
couriers
one
of
them
named
létoile
managed
to
get
as
far
as
evreux
in
normandy
and
to
return
to
the
beleaguered
city
with
a
couple
of
hundred
letters
success
also
repeatedly
attended
the
efforts
of
two
shrewd
fellows
named
gême
and
brare
who
made
several
journeys
to
saint
germain
triel
and
even
orleans
on
one
occasion
they
brought
as
many
as
seven
hundred
letters
with
them
on
their
return
to
paris
but
between
twenty
and
thirty
other
couriers
failed
to
get
through
the
german
lines
whilst
several
others
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
who
at
once
confiscated
the
correspondence
they
carried
but
did
not
otherwise
molest
them
the
difficulty
in
sending
letters
out
of
paris
and
in
obtaining
news
from
relatives
and
friends
in
other
parts
of
france
led
to
all
sorts
of
schemes
the
founder
and
editor
of
that
journal
hippolyte
de
villemessant
as
he
called
himself
though
i
believe
that
his
real
christian
name
was
auguste
declared
in
his
paper
that
he
would
willingly
allow
his
veins
to
be
opened
in
return
for
a
few
lines
from
his
beloved
and
absent
wife
conjugal
affection
could
scarcely
have
gone
further
villemessant
however
followed
up
his
touching
declaration
by
announcing
that
a
thousand
francs
a
week
was
to
be
earned
by
a
capable
man
willing
to
act
as
between
paris
and
the
provinces
all
who
felt
qualified
for
the
post
were
invited
to
present
themselves
at
the
office
of
which
in
those
days
was
appropriately
located
in
the
rue
rossini
named
of
course
after
the
illustrious
composer
who
wrote
such
sprightly
music
round
the
theme
of
beaumarchais
comedy
as
a
result
of
villemessant
announcement
the
street
was
blocked
during
the
next
hours
by
men
of
all
classes
who
were
all
the
more
eager
to
earn
the
aforesaid
a
week
as
nearly
every
kind
of
work
was
at
a
standstill
and
the
daily
stipend
of
a
national
guard
amounted
only
to
it
was
difficult
to
choose
from
among
so
many
candidates
but
we
were
eventually
assured
that
the
right
man
had
been
found
in
the
person
of
a
retired
poacher
who
knew
so
well
how
to
circumvent
both
rural
guards
and
forest
guards
that
during
a
career
of
twenty
years
or
so
he
had
never
once
been
caught
flagrante
expert
moreover
in
tracking
game
he
would
also
well
know
how
to
detect
and
to
avoid
the
tracks
of
the
prussians
we
were
therefore
invited
to
confide
our
correspondence
to
this
sagacious
individual
who
would
undertake
to
carry
it
through
the
german
lines
and
to
return
with
the
answers
in
a
week
or
ten
days
the
charge
for
each
letter
which
was
to
be
of
very
small
weight
and
dimensions
was
fixed
at
five
francs
and
it
was
estimated
that
the
would
be
able
to
carry
about
letters
on
each
journey
many
people
were
anxious
to
try
the
scheme
but
rival
newspapers
denounced
it
as
being
a
means
of
acquainting
the
prussians
with
everything
which
was
occurring
in
paris
villemessant
who
they
declared
had
taken
bribes
from
the
fallen
empire
being
probably
one
of
bismarck
paid
agents
thus
the
enterprise
speedily
collapsed
without
even
being
put
to
the
proof
however
the
public
was
successfully
exploited
by
various
individuals
who
attempted
to
improve
on
villemessant
idea
undertaking
to
send
letters
out
of
paris
for
a
fixed
charge
half
of
which
was
to
be
returned
to
the
sender
if
his
letter
were
not
delivered
as
none
of
the
letters
handed
in
on
these
conditions
was
even
entrusted
to
a
messenger
the
ingenious
authors
of
this
scheme
made
a
handsome
profit
politely
returning
half
of
the
money
which
they
received
but
retaining
the
balance
without
making
the
slightest
effort
to
carry
out
their
contract
rampont
a
very
clever
man
who
was
now
our
had
already
issued
a
circular
bidding
us
to
use
the
very
thinnest
paper
and
the
smallest
envelopes
procurable
there
being
so
many
failures
among
the
messengers
whom
he
sent
out
of
paris
with
correspondence
the
idea
of
a
balloon
postal
service
occurred
to
him
although
ninety
years
or
so
had
elapsed
since
the
days
of
the
brothers
montgolfier
aeronautics
had
really
made
very
little
progress
there
were
no
dirigible
balloons
at
all
dupuy
de
lôme
first
experiments
only
dated
from
the
siege
days
and
dirigible
was
not
devised
until
the
early
eighties
we
only
had
the
ordinary
type
of
balloon
at
our
disposal
and
at
the
outset
of
the
investment
there
were
certainly
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
balloons
within
our
lines
a
great
city
like
paris
however
is
not
without
resources
everything
needed
for
the
construction
of
balloons
could
be
found
there
gas
also
was
procurable
and
we
had
amongst
us
quite
a
number
of
men
expert
in
the
science
of
ballooning
such
as
it
then
was
there
was
nadar
there
was
tissandier
there
were
the
godard
brothers
yon
dartois
and
a
good
many
others
both
the
godards
and
nadar
established
balloon
factories
which
were
generally
located
in
our
large
disused
railway
stations
such
as
the
gare
du
nord
the
gare
and
the
gare
montparnasse
but
i
also
remember
visiting
one
which
nadar
installed
in
the
dancing
hall
called
the
elysée
montmartre
each
of
these
factories
provided
work
for
a
good
many
people
and
i
recollect
being
particularly
struck
by
the
number
of
women
who
were
employed
in
such
work
was
very
helpful
to
them
and
nadar
used
to
say
to
me
that
it
grieved
him
to
have
to
turn
away
so
many
applicants
for
employment
for
every
day
ten
twenty
and
thirty
women
would
come
to
implore
him
to
take
them
on
nearly
all
their
usual
workrooms
were
closed
some
were
reduced
to
live
on
charity
and
only
very
small
allowances
from
fivepence
to
sevenpence
a
day
were
made
to
the
wives
and
families
of
national
guards
but
to
return
to
the
balloon
which
the
government
organized
it
was
at
once
realized
by
my
father
and
myself
that
it
could
be
of
little
use
to
us
so
far
as
the
work
for
the
london
was
concerned
on
account
of
the
restrictions
which
were
imposed
in
regard
to
the
size
and
weight
of
each
letter
that
might
be
posted
the
weight
indeed
was
fixed
at
no
more
than
three
grammes
now
there
were
a
number
of
artists
working
for
the
in
paris
first
and
foremost
among
them
being
jules
pelcoq
who
must
personally
have
supplied
of
the
sketches
by
which
the
british
public
was
kept
acquainted
with
the
many
incidents
of
parisian
the
weekly
diary
which
i
helped
my
father
to
compile
could
be
drawn
up
in
small
handwriting
on
very
thin
almost
transparent
paper
and
despatched
in
the
ordinary
way
but
how
were
we
to
circumvent
the
authorities
in
regard
to
our
sketches
which
were
often
of
considerable
size
and
were
always
made
on
fairly
substantial
paper
the
great
majority
of
them
being
further
though
i
could
prepare
two
or
three
drafts
of
our
diary
or
our
other
copy
for
despatch
by
successive
balloons
to
provide
for
the
contingency
of
one
of
the
latter
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
it
seemed
absurd
that
our
artists
should
have
to
recopy
every
sketch
they
made
fortunately
there
was
photography
the
thought
of
which
brought
about
a
solution
of
the
other
difficulty
in
which
we
were
placed
i
was
sent
to
interview
nadar
on
the
place
saint
pierre
at
montmartre
above
which
his
captive
balloon
the
neptune
was
oscillating
in
the
september
breeze
he
was
much
the
same
man
as
i
had
seen
at
the
crystal
palace
a
few
years
previously
tall
and
he
had
begun
life
as
a
caricaturist
and
humorous
writer
but
by
way
of
buttering
his
bread
had
set
up
in
business
as
a
photographer
his
establishment
on
the
boulevard
de
la
madeleine
soon
becoming
very
favourably
known
there
was
still
a
little
in
paris
during
those
early
siege
days
photographs
of
the
celebrities
or
notorieties
of
the
hour
sold
fairly
well
and
every
now
and
again
some
national
guard
with
means
was
anxious
to
be
photographed
in
his
uniform
but
naturally
enough
the
business
generally
had
declined
thus
nadar
was
only
too
pleased
to
entertain
the
proposal
which
i
made
to
him
on
my
father
behalf
this
being
that
every
sketch
for
the
should
be
taken
to
his
establishment
and
there
photographed
so
that
we
might
be
able
to
send
out
copies
in
at
least
three
successive
balloons
when
i
broached
to
nadar
the
subject
of
the
postal
regulations
in
regard
to
the
weight
and
size
of
letters
he
genially
replied
leave
that
to
me
your
packets
need
not
go
through
the
ordinary
post
at
all
at
least
here
in
paris
have
them
stamped
however
bring
them
whenever
a
balloon
is
about
to
sail
and
i
will
see
that
the
aeronaut
takes
them
in
his
pocket
wherever
he
alights
they
will
be
posted
like
the
letters
in
the
official
bags
that
plan
was
carried
out
and
although
several
balloons
were
lost
or
fell
within
the
german
lines
only
one
small
packet
of
sketches
which
on
account
of
urgency
had
not
been
photographed
remained
subsequently
unaccounted
for
in
all
other
instances
either
the
original
drawing
or
one
of
the
photographic
copies
of
it
reached
london
safely
the
very
first
balloon
to
leave
paris
in
the
early
days
of
october
was
precisely
nadar
neptune
which
had
originally
been
intended
for
purposes
of
military
observation
one
day
when
i
was
with
nadar
on
the
place
saint
pierre
he
took
me
up
in
it
i
found
the
experience
a
novel
but
not
a
pleasing
one
for
all
my
life
i
have
had
a
tendency
to
vertigo
when
ascending
to
any
unusual
height
i
remember
that
it
was
a
clear
day
and
that
we
had
a
fine
view
of
paris
on
the
one
hand
and
of
the
plain
of
saint
denis
on
the
other
but
i
confess
that
i
felt
out
element
and
was
glad
to
set
foot
on
once
more
from
that
day
i
was
quite
content
to
view
the
ascent
of
one
and
another
balloon
without
feeling
any
desire
to
get
out
of
paris
by
its
aerial
transport
service
i
must
have
witnessed
the
departure
of
practically
all
the
balloons
which
left
paris
until
i
myself
quitted
the
city
in
november
the
arrangements
made
with
nadar
were
perfected
and
something
very
similar
was
contrived
with
the
godard
brothers
the
upshot
being
that
we
were
always
forewarned
whenever
it
was
proposed
to
send
off
a
balloon
sometimes
we
received
by
messenger
in
the
evening
an
intimation
that
a
balloon
would
start
at
daybreak
on
the
morrow
sometimes
we
were
roused
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
when
everything
intended
for
despatch
had
to
be
hastily
got
together
and
carried
at
once
to
the
such
for
instance
as
the
northern
or
the
orleans
railway
terminus
both
being
at
a
considerable
distance
from
our
flat
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
those
were
by
no
means
agreeable
walks
especially
when
the
cold
weather
had
set
in
as
it
did
early
that
autumn
and
every
now
and
again
at
the
end
of
the
journey
one
found
that
it
had
been
made
in
vain
for
the
wind
having
shifted
at
the
last
moment
the
departure
of
the
balloon
had
been
postponed
of
course
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
trudge
back
home
again
there
was
no
omnibus
service
all
the
horses
having
been
requisitioned
and
in
the
latter
part
of
october
there
were
not
more
than
a
couple
of
dozen
cabs
drawn
by
decrepit
animals
still
plying
for
hire
in
all
paris
thus
shanks
pony
was
the
only
means
of
locomotion
in
the
earlier
days
my
father
accompanied
me
on
a
few
of
those
expeditions
but
he
soon
grew
tired
of
them
particularly
as
his
health
became
affected
by
the
siege
diet
we
were
together
however
when
gambetta
took
his
departure
on
october
ascending
from
the
place
saint
pierre
in
a
balloon
constructed
by
nadar
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
should
leave
for
the
provinces
in
order
to
reinforce
the
three
government
delegates
who
had
been
despatched
thither
prior
to
the
investment
jules
favre
the
foreign
minister
had
been
previously
urged
to
join
those
delegates
but
would
not
trust
himself
to
a
balloon
and
it
was
thereupon
proposed
to
gambetta
that
he
should
do
so
he
willingly
assented
to
the
suggestion
particularly
as
he
feared
that
the
rest
of
the
country
was
being
overlooked
owing
to
the
prevailing
opinion
that
paris
would
suffice
to
deliver
both
herself
and
all
the
rest
of
france
from
the
presence
of
the
enemy
born
in
april
he
was
at
this
time
in
his
year
and
full
of
vigour
as
the
sequel
showed
the
delegates
whom
he
was
going
to
join
were
as
i
previously
mentioned
very
old
men
well
meaning
no
doubt
but
incapable
of
making
the
great
effort
which
was
made
by
gambetta
in
conjunction
with
charles
de
freycinet
who
was
just
in
his
prime
being
the
young
dictator
senior
by
some
ten
years
i
can
still
picture
gambetta
departure
and
particularly
his
appearance
on
the
occasion
his
fur
cap
and
his
fur
coat
which
made
him
look
somewhat
like
a
polish
jew
he
had
with
him
his
secretary
the
devoted
spuller
i
can
not
recall
the
name
of
the
aeronaut
who
was
in
charge
of
the
balloon
but
if
my
memory
serves
me
rightly
it
was
precisely
to
him
that
nadar
handed
the
packet
of
sketches
which
failed
to
reach
the
london
they
must
have
been
lost
in
the
confusion
of
the
aerial
voyage
which
was
marked
by
several
dramatic
incidents
some
accounts
say
that
gambetta
evinced
no
little
anxiety
during
the
preparations
for
the
ascent
but
to
me
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
remarkably
good
humour
as
if
indeed
in
pleasurable
anticipation
of
what
he
was
about
to
experience
when
in
response
to
the
call
of
lachez
tout
the
seamen
released
the
last
cables
which
had
hitherto
prevented
the
balloon
from
rising
and
the
crowd
burst
into
shouts
of
vive
la
republique
and
vive
gambetta
the
youthful
statesman
as
he
was
then
called
leant
over
the
side
of
the
car
and
waved
his
cap
in
response
to
the
plaudits
another
balloon
the
george
sand
ascended
at
the
same
time
having
in
its
car
various
officials
who
were
to
negotiate
the
purchase
of
in
the
united
states
the
journey
was
eventful
for
the
germans
repeatedly
fired
at
the
balloon
a
first
attempt
at
descent
had
to
be
abandoned
when
the
car
was
at
an
altitude
of
no
more
than
feet
for
at
that
moment
some
german
soldiers
were
seen
almost
immediately
beneath
it
they
fired
and
before
the
balloon
could
rise
again
a
bullet
grazed
gambetta
head
at
four
in
the
afternoon
however
the
descent
was
renewed
near
roye
in
the
somme
when
the
balloon
was
caught
in
an
gambetta
at
one
moment
hanging
on
to
the
ropes
of
the
car
with
his
head
downward
some
countryfolk
came
up
in
great
anger
taking
the
party
to
be
prussians
but
on
learning
the
truth
they
rendered
all
possible
assistance
and
gambetta
and
his
companions
repaired
to
the
house
of
the
mayor
of
the
neighbouring
village
of
tricot
alluding
in
after
days
to
his
experiences
on
this
journey
the
great
man
said
that
the
earth
as
seen
by
him
from
the
car
of
the
balloon
looked
like
a
huge
carpet
woven
with
different
coloured
wools
it
did
not
impress
him
at
all
he
added
as
it
was
really
nothing
but
une
vilaine
chinoiserie
it
was
from
rouen
where
he
arrived
on
the
following
day
that
he
issued
the
famous
proclamation
in
which
he
called
on
france
to
make
a
compact
with
victory
or
death
on
october
he
joined
the
other
delegates
at
tours
and
took
over
the
post
of
minister
of
war
as
well
as
that
of
minister
of
the
interior
his
departure
from
the
capital
was
celebrated
by
that
clever
versifier
of
the
period
albert
millaud
who
contributed
to
an
amusing
effusion
the
first
verse
of
which
was
to
this
effect
gambetta
pale
and
gloomy
much
wished
to
go
to
tours
but
two
hundred
thousand
prussians
in
his
project
made
him
pause
to
aid
the
youthful
statesman
came
the
aeronaut
nadar
who
sent
up
the
with
gambetta
in
its
car
further
on
came
the
following
lines
supposed
to
be
spoken
by
gambetta
himself
whilst
he
was
gazing
at
the
german
lines
beneath
him
see
how
the
plain
is
glistening
with
their
helmets
in
a
mass
impalement
would
be
dreadful
on
those
spikes
of
polished
brass
millaud
who
was
a
jew
the
son
i
think
or
at
all
events
a
near
relation
of
the
famous
founder
of
petit
the
advent
of
which
constituted
a
great
landmark
in
the
history
of
the
french
press
set
himself
during
several
years
of
his
career
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
axiom
that
in
france
tout
finit
par
des
chansons
during
those
anxious
siege
days
he
was
for
ever
striving
to
sound
a
gay
note
something
which
for
a
moment
at
all
events
might
drive
dull
care
away
here
is
an
english
version
of
some
verses
which
he
wrote
on
nadar
what
a
strange
fellow
is
nadar
photographer
and
aeronaut
he
is
as
clever
as
godard
what
a
strange
fellow
is
nadar
although
between
ourselves
as
far
as
art
concerned
he
knoweth
naught
what
a
strange
fellow
is
nadar
photographer
and
aeronaut
to
guide
the
course
of
a
balloon
his
mind
conceived
the
wondrous
screw
some
day
he
hopes
unto
the
moon
to
guide
the
course
of
a
balloon
of
navies
admiral
soon
we
see
him
in
the
blue
to
guide
the
course
of
a
balloon
his
mind
conceived
the
wondrous
screw
up
in
the
kingdom
of
the
air
he
now
the
foremost
rank
may
claim
if
poor
gambetta
when
up
there
up
in
the
kingdom
of
the
air
does
not
find
good
cause
to
stare
why
nadar
will
not
be
to
blame
up
in
the
kingdom
of
the
air
he
now
the
foremost
rank
may
claim
at
ferrières
above
the
park
behold
him
darting
through
the
sky
soaring
to
heaven
like
a
lark
at
ferrières
above
the
park
whilst
william
whispers
to
bismarck
see
nadar
there
on
high
at
ferrières
above
the
park
behold
him
darting
through
the
sky
oh
thou
more
hairy
than
king
clodion
bearer
on
high
of
this
report
thou
yellower
than
a
pure
cambodian
and
far
more
daring
than
king
clodion
we
cast
thy
statue
in
collodion
and
mount
it
on
a
gas
retort
oh
thou
more
hairy
than
king
clodion
bearer
on
high
of
this
report
perhaps
it
may
not
be
thought
too
pedantic
on
my
part
if
i
explain
that
the
king
clodion
referred
to
in
millaud
last
verse
was
the
legendary
clodion
the
hairy
a
supposed
leader
of
the
franks
reputed
to
be
a
forerunner
of
the
founder
of
the
merovingian
dynasty
nadar
hair
however
was
not
long
like
that
of
rois
for
it
was
simply
a
huge
curly
and
somewhat
reddish
mop
as
for
his
complexion
millaud
phrase
yellow
as
a
pure
cambodian
was
a
happy
thought
these
allusions
to
millaud
sprightly
verse
remind
me
that
throughout
the
siege
of
paris
the
pour
was
never
once
lost
sight
of
at
all
times
and
in
respect
to
everything
there
was
a
superabundance
of
jests
jests
on
the
germans
the
national
and
the
mobile
guard
the
fallen
dynasty
and
the
new
republic
the
fruitless
sorties
the
wretched
rations
the
failing
gas
and
many
other
people
and
things
one
of
the
enemy
generals
was
said
to
have
remarked
one
day
i
do
know
how
to
satisfy
my
men
they
complain
of
hunger
and
yet
i
lead
them
every
morning
to
the
slaughterhouse
at
another
time
a
french
colonel
of
conservative
ideas
was
said
to
have
replaced
the
inscription
liberty
equality
fraternity
which
he
found
painted
on
the
walls
of
his
barracks
by
the
words
infantry
cavalry
artillery
declaring
that
the
latter
were
far
more
likely
to
free
the
country
of
the
presence
of
the
hated
enemy
as
for
the
treason
mania
which
was
very
prevalent
at
this
time
it
was
related
that
a
soldier
remarked
one
day
to
a
comrade
i
am
sure
that
the
captain
is
a
traitor
indeed
how
that
was
the
prompt
rejoinder
well
said
the
suspicious
private
have
you
not
noticed
that
every
time
he
orders
us
to
march
forward
we
invariably
encounter
the
enemy
when
trochu
issued
a
decree
incorporating
all
national
guards
under
years
of
age
in
the
marching
battalions
for
duty
outside
the
city
one
of
these
guards
on
being
asked
how
old
he
was
replied
how
is
that
he
was
asked
a
few
weeks
ago
you
told
everybody
that
you
were
only
quite
true
rejoined
the
other
but
what
with
demonstrating
at
the
short
rations
and
the
cold
weather
i
feel
quite
ten
years
older
than
i
formerly
did
when
horseflesh
became
more
or
less
our
daily
provender
many
parisian
found
their
health
failing
what
is
the
matter
my
dearest
madame
du
bois
du
pont
inquired
of
her
husband
when
he
had
collapsed
one
evening
after
dinner
oh
it
is
nothing
he
replied
i
dare
say
i
shall
soon
feel
well
again
but
i
used
to
think
myself
a
better
horseman
directly
our
supply
of
gas
began
to
fail
the
wags
insinuated
that
henri
rochefort
was
jubilant
and
if
you
inquired
the
reason
thereof
you
were
told
that
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
gas
everybody
would
be
obliged
to
buy
hundreds
of
we
had
of
course
plenty
of
sensations
in
those
days
but
if
you
wished
to
cap
every
one
of
them
you
merely
had
to
walk
into
a
café
and
ask
the
waiter
for
a
railway
once
before
i
referred
to
the
caricatures
of
the
period
notably
to
those
libelling
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
and
the
empress
eugénie
the
latter
being
currently
personified
as
messalina
or
even
as
something
worse
and
this
of
course
without
the
faintest
shadow
of
justification
but
the
caricaturists
were
not
merely
concerned
with
the
fallen
dynasty
one
of
the
principal
cartoonists
of
the
at
that
moment
was
cham
otherwise
the
vicomte
amédée
de
noé
an
old
friend
of
my
family
it
was
he
by
the
way
who
before
the
war
insisted
on
my
going
to
a
saying
look
here
if
you
mean
to
live
in
france
and
be
a
journalist
you
must
know
how
to
hold
a
sword
come
with
me
to
ruzé
i
taught
your
uncle
frank
and
his
friend
gustave
doré
how
to
fence
many
years
ago
and
now
i
am
going
to
have
you
taught
well
in
one
of
his
cartoons
issued
during
the
siege
cham
disgusted
like
most
frenchmen
at
the
seeming
indifference
of
great
britain
to
the
plight
in
which
france
found
herself
summed
up
the
situation
as
he
conceived
it
by
depicting
the
british
lion
licking
the
boots
of
bismarck
who
was
disguised
as
davy
crockett
when
my
father
remonstrated
with
cham
on
the
subject
reminding
him
of
his
own
connexion
with
england
the
indignant
caricaturist
replied
do
speak
of
it
i
have
renounced
england
and
all
her
works
he
like
other
frenchmen
of
the
time
contended
that
we
had
placed
ourselves
under
great
obligations
to
france
at
the
period
of
the
crimean
war
among
the
best
caricatures
of
the
was
one
by
daumier
which
showed
death
appearing
to
bismarck
in
his
sleep
and
murmuring
softly
thanks
many
thanks
another
idea
of
the
period
found
expression
in
a
cartoon
representing
a
large
labelled
france
into
which
a
company
of
mice
dressed
up
as
german
soldiers
were
eagerly
marching
their
officer
meanwhile
pointing
to
a
cheese
fixed
inside
the
trap
and
inscribed
with
the
name
of
paris
below
the
design
ran
the
legend
ah
if
we
could
only
catch
them
all
in
it
many
indeed
most
of
the
caricatures
of
the
time
did
not
appear
in
the
humorous
journals
but
were
issued
separately
at
a
penny
apiece
and
were
usually
coloured
by
the
stencilling
process
in
one
of
them
i
remember
bismarck
was
seen
wearing
boots
and
making
ineffectual
attempts
to
step
from
versailles
to
paris
another
depicted
the
king
of
prussia
as
butcher
william
knife
in
hand
and
attired
in
the
orthodox
costume
whilst
in
yet
another
design
the
same
monarch
was
shown
urging
poor
death
who
had
fallen
exhausted
in
the
snow
with
his
scythe
lying
broken
beside
him
to
continue
on
the
march
until
the
last
of
the
french
nation
should
be
exterminated
of
caricatures
representing
cooks
in
connexion
with
cats
there
was
no
end
the
de
being
in
great
demand
for
the
and
after
gambetta
had
left
us
there
were
designs
showing
the
armies
of
succour
which
were
to
be
raised
in
the
provinces
endeavouring
to
pass
ribs
of
beef
fat
geese
legs
of
mutton
and
strings
of
sausages
over
several
rows
of
german
helmets
gathered
round
a
bastion
labelled
paris
whence
a
famished
national
guard
eager
for
the
proffered
provisions
was
trying
to
spring
but
could
not
do
so
owing
to
the
restraining
arm
of
general
trochu
before
the
investment
began
paris
was
already
afflicted
with
a
spy
mania
sala
adventure
which
i
recounted
in
an
earlier
chapter
was
in
a
way
connected
with
this
delusion
which
originated
with
the
cry
we
are
betrayed
immediately
after
the
first
french
reverses
the
instances
of
spyophobia
were
innumerable
and
often
curious
and
amusing
there
was
a
slight
abatement
of
the
mania
when
shortly
before
the
siege
germans
were
expelled
from
paris
leaving
behind
them
only
some
old
folk
invalids
and
children
who
were
unable
to
obey
the
government
decree
but
the
disease
soon
revived
and
we
heard
of
having
their
baskets
ransacked
by
zealous
national
guards
who
imagined
that
these
receptacles
might
contain
secret
despatches
or
contraband
ammunition
on
another
occasion
wickedly
suggested
that
all
the
blind
beggars
in
paris
were
spies
with
the
result
that
several
poor
infirm
old
creatures
were
abominably
again
a
fugitive
sheet
called
denounced
all
the
english
residents
as
spies
labouchere
was
one
of
those
pounced
upon
by
a
parisian
mob
in
consequence
of
that
idiotic
denunciation
but
as
he
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
invite
those
who
assailed
him
to
go
with
him
to
the
nearest
he
was
speedily
released
on
two
occasions
my
father
and
myself
were
arrested
and
carried
to
and
in
the
course
of
those
experiences
we
discovered
that
the
beautifully
engraved
but
essentially
ridiculous
british
passport
which
recited
all
the
honours
and
dignities
of
the
secretary
of
state
or
the
ambassador
delivering
it
but
gave
not
the
slightest
information
respecting
the
person
to
whom
it
had
been
delivered
apart
that
is
from
his
or
her
name
was
of
infinitely
less
value
in
the
eyes
of
a
french
officer
than
a
receipt
for
rent
or
a
parisian
tradesman
bill
that
was
years
ago
the
british
passport
however
remains
as
unsatisfactory
as
it
was
then
but
let
me
pass
to
other
instances
one
day
an
unfortunate
individual
working
in
the
paris
sewers
was
espied
by
a
zealous
national
guard
who
at
once
gave
the
alarm
declaring
that
there
was
a
german
spy
in
the
aforesaid
sewers
and
that
he
was
depositing
bombs
there
with
the
intention
of
blowing
up
the
city
three
hundred
guards
at
once
volunteered
their
services
stalked
the
poor
workman
and
blew
him
to
pieces
the
next
time
he
popped
his
head
out
of
a
the
mistake
was
afterwards
deplored
but
people
argued
wrote
thomas
gibson
bowles
who
sent
the
story
to
the
morning
post
that
it
was
far
better
that
a
hundred
innocent
frenchmen
should
suffer
than
that
a
single
prussian
should
escape
cham
to
whom
i
previously
alluded
old
marshal
vaillant
an
american
diplomatist
and
alexis
godillot
the
french
army
contractor
were
among
the
many
people
arrested
as
spies
at
one
or
another
moment
a
certain
mme
de
beaulieu
who
had
joined
a
regiment
of
mobiles
as
a
was
denounced
as
a
spy
because
her
hands
were
so
white
another
lady
who
had
installed
an
ambulance
in
her
house
was
carried
off
to
prison
on
an
equally
frivolous
pretext
and
i
remember
yet
another
case
in
which
a
lady
patron
of
the
societe
de
secours
aux
blesses
was
matters
would
however
probably
be
far
worse
at
the
present
time
for
paris
with
all
her
apaches
and
anarchists
now
includes
in
her
population
even
more
scum
than
was
the
case
years
ago
there
were
however
a
few
authentic
instances
of
spying
one
case
being
that
of
a
young
fellow
whom
etienne
arago
the
mayor
of
paris
engaged
as
a
secretary
on
the
recommendation
of
henri
rochefort
but
who
turned
out
to
be
of
german
extraction
and
availed
himself
of
his
official
position
to
draw
up
reports
which
were
forwarded
by
balloon
post
to
an
agent
of
the
german
government
in
london
i
have
forgotten
the
culprit
name
but
it
will
be
found
with
particulars
of
his
case
in
the
paris
journals
of
the
siege
days
there
was
moreover
the
hardt
affair
which
resulted
in
the
prisoner
a
former
lieutenant
in
the
prussian
army
being
convicted
of
espionage
and
shot
in
the
courtyard
of
the
ecole
militaire
with
spyophobia
there
was
another
craze
that
of
suspecting
any
light
seen
at
in
an
attic
or
window
to
be
a
signal
intended
for
the
enemy
many
ludicrous
incidents
occurred
in
connexion
with
this
panic
one
night
an
elderly
who
had
recently
married
a
charming
young
woman
was
suddenly
dragged
from
his
bed
by
a
party
of
indignant
national
guards
and
consigned
to
the
until
daybreak
this
had
been
brought
about
by
his
wife
maid
placing
a
couple
of
lighted
candles
in
her
window
as
a
signal
to
the
wife
lover
that
master
being
at
home
he
was
not
to
come
up
to
the
flat
that
night
on
another
occasion
a
poor
old
lady
who
was
patriotically
depriving
herself
of
sleep
in
order
to
make
lint
for
the
ambulances
was
pounced
upon
and
nearly
strangled
for
exhibiting
green
and
red
signals
from
her
window
it
turned
out
however
that
the
signals
in
question
were
merely
the
reflections
of
a
harmless
though
charmingly
variegated
parrot
which
was
the
zealous
old
dame
sole
and
faithful
companion
no
matter
what
might
be
the
quarter
of
paris
in
which
a
presumed
signal
was
observed
the
house
whence
it
emanated
was
at
once
invaded
by
national
guards
and
perfectly
innocent
people
were
often
carried
off
and
subjected
to
to
such
proportions
did
the
craze
attain
that
some
papers
even
proposed
that
the
government
should
forbid
any
kind
of
light
whatever
after
dark
in
any
room
situated
above
the
second
floor
unless
the
windows
of
that
room
were
hermetically
sealed
most
victims
of
the
mania
submitted
to
the
mob
invasion
of
their
homes
without
raising
any
particular
protest
but
a
volunteer
artilleryman
who
wrote
to
the
authorities
complaining
that
his
rooms
had
been
ransacked
in
his
absence
and
his
aged
mother
frightened
out
of
her
wits
on
the
pretext
that
some
fusees
had
been
fired
from
his
windows
declared
that
if
there
should
be
any
repetition
of
such
an
intrusion
whilst
he
was
at
home
he
would
receive
the
invaders
bayonet
and
revolver
in
hand
from
that
moment
similar
protests
poured
into
the
and
trochu
ended
by
issuing
a
proclamation
in
which
he
said
under
the
most
frivolous
pretexts
numerous
houses
have
been
entered
and
peaceful
citizens
have
been
maltreated
the
flags
of
friendly
nations
have
been
powerless
to
protect
the
houses
where
they
were
displayed
i
have
ordered
an
inquiry
on
the
subject
and
i
now
command
that
all
persons
guilty
of
these
abusive
practices
shall
be
arrested
a
special
service
has
been
organized
in
order
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
keeping
up
any
communication
with
any
of
its
partisans
in
the
city
and
i
remind
everybody
that
excepting
in
such
instances
as
are
foreseen
by
the
law
every
citizen
residence
is
inviolable
we
nowadays
hear
a
great
deal
about
the
claims
of
women
but
although
the
followers
of
pankhurst
have
carried
on
a
sort
of
a
war
for
a
considerable
time
past
i
have
not
yet
noticed
any
disposition
on
their
part
to
join
the
colours
men
currently
assert
that
women
can
not
serve
as
soldiers
there
are
however
many
historical
instances
of
women
distinguishing
themselves
in
warfare
and
modern
conditions
are
even
more
favourable
than
former
ones
for
the
employment
of
women
as
soldiers
there
is
splendid
material
to
be
derived
from
the
the
the
and
the
all
of
them
active
and
in
innumerable
instances
far
stronger
than
many
of
the
boys
whom
we
now
see
in
our
regiments
briefly
a
day
may
well
come
when
we
shall
see
many
of
our
superfluous
women
taking
to
the
career
of
arms
however
the
attempts
made
to
establish
a
corps
of
in
paris
during
the
german
siege
were
more
amusing
than
serious
early
in
october
some
hundreds
of
women
demonstrated
outside
the
demanding
that
all
the
male
nurses
attached
to
the
ambulances
should
be
replaced
by
women
the
authorities
promised
to
grant
that
application
and
the
women
next
claimed
the
right
to
share
the
dangers
of
the
field
with
their
husbands
and
their
brothers
this
question
was
repeatedly
discussed
at
the
public
clubs
notably
at
one
in
the
rue
pierre
levée
where
louise
michel
the
schoolmistress
who
subsequently
participated
in
the
commune
and
was
transported
to
new
caledonia
officiated
as
and
at
another
located
at
the
triat
gymnasium
in
the
avenue
montaigne
where
as
a
rule
no
men
were
allowed
to
be
present
that
is
excepting
a
certain
citizen
jules
allix
an
eccentric
elderly
survivor
of
the
republic
of
at
which
period
he
had
devised
a
system
of
telepathy
effected
by
means
of
sympathetic
snails
one
sunday
afternoon
in
october
the
lady
members
of
this
club
being
in
urgent
need
of
funds
decided
to
admit
men
among
their
audience
at
the
small
charge
of
twopence
per
head
and
on
hearing
this
my
father
and
myself
strolled
round
to
witness
the
proceedings
they
were
remarkably
lively
allix
while
reading
a
report
respecting
the
club
progress
began
to
libel
some
of
the
paris
convents
whereupon
a
national
guard
in
the
audience
flatly
called
him
a
liar
a
terrific
hubbub
arose
all
the
women
gesticulating
and
protesting
whilst
their
energetically
rang
her
bell
and
the
interrupter
strode
towards
the
platform
he
proved
to
be
none
other
than
the
duc
de
a
lineal
descendant
of
our
last
stuart
king
by
marlborough
sister
arabella
churchill
he
tried
to
speak
but
the
many
loud
screams
prevented
him
from
doing
so
some
of
the
women
threatened
him
with
violence
whilst
a
few
others
thanked
him
for
defending
the
church
at
last
however
he
leapt
on
the
platform
and
in
doing
so
overturned
both
a
long
table
covered
with
green
baize
and
the
members
of
the
committee
who
were
seated
behind
it
jules
allix
thereupon
sprang
at
the
duke
throat
they
struggled
and
fell
together
from
the
platform
and
rolled
in
the
dust
below
it
it
was
long
before
order
was
restored
but
this
was
finally
effected
by
a
young
woman
who
addressing
the
male
portion
of
the
audience
exclaimed
citizens
if
you
say
another
word
we
will
fling
what
you
have
paid
for
admission
in
your
faces
and
order
you
out
of
doors
business
then
began
the
discussion
turning
chiefly
upon
two
points
the
first
being
that
all
women
should
be
armed
and
do
duty
on
the
ramparts
and
the
second
that
the
women
should
defend
their
honour
from
the
attacks
of
the
germans
by
means
of
prussic
acid
allix
remarked
that
it
would
be
very
appropriate
to
employ
prussic
acid
in
killing
prussians
and
explained
to
us
that
this
might
be
effected
by
means
of
little
indiarubber
thimbles
which
the
women
would
place
on
their
fingers
each
thimble
being
tipped
with
a
small
pointed
tube
containing
some
of
the
acid
in
question
if
an
amorous
prussian
should
venture
too
close
to
a
fair
parisienne
the
latter
would
merely
have
to
hold
out
her
hand
and
prick
him
in
another
instant
he
would
fall
dead
no
matter
how
many
of
the
enemy
may
assail
her
added
allix
enthusiastically
she
will
simply
have
to
prick
them
one
by
one
and
we
shall
see
her
standing
still
pure
and
holy
in
the
midst
of
a
circle
of
corpses
at
these
words
many
of
the
women
in
the
audience
were
moved
to
tears
but
the
men
laughed
hilariously
such
disorderly
scenes
occurred
at
this
women
club
that
the
landlord
of
the
triat
gymnasium
at
last
took
possession
of
the
premises
again
and
the
ejected
members
vainly
endeavoured
to
find
accommodation
elsewhere
nevertheless
another
scheme
for
organizing
an
armed
force
of
women
was
started
and
one
day
on
observing
on
the
walls
of
paris
a
green
placard
which
announced
the
formation
of
a
legion
of
amazons
of
the
seine
i
repaired
to
the
rue
turbigo
where
this
legion
enlistment
office
had
been
opened
after
making
my
way
up
a
staircase
crowded
with
recruits
who
were
mostly
muscular
women
from
to
forty
years
of
age
the
older
ones
sometimes
being
unduly
stout
and
not
one
of
them
in
my
youthful
opinion
at
all
i
managed
to
squeeze
my
way
into
the
private
office
of
the
projector
of
the
legion
or
as
he
called
himself
its
provisional
chef
de
bataillon
he
was
a
wiry
little
man
with
a
grey
moustache
and
a
military
bearing
and
answered
to
the
name
of
félix
belly
a
year
or
two
previously
he
had
unjustly
incurred
a
great
deal
of
ridicule
in
paris
owing
to
his
attempts
to
float
a
panama
canal
scheme
only
five
years
after
the
war
however
the
same
idea
was
taken
up
by
ferdinand
de
lesseps
and
french
folk
who
had
laughed
it
to
scorn
in
belly
time
proved
only
too
ready
to
fling
their
savings
into
the
bottomless
gulf
of
lesseps
enterprise
i
remember
having
a
long
chat
with
belly
who
was
most
enthusiastic
respecting
his
proposed
amazons
they
were
to
defend
the
ramparts
and
barricades
of
paris
said
he
being
armed
with
light
guns
carrying
some
yards
and
their
costume
a
model
of
which
was
shown
me
was
to
consist
of
black
trousers
with
stripes
down
the
outer
seams
black
blouses
with
capes
and
black
képis
also
with
orange
trimmings
further
each
woman
was
to
carry
a
attached
to
a
it
was
hoped
that
the
first
battalion
would
muster
quite
women
divided
into
eight
companies
of
each
there
was
to
be
a
special
medical
service
and
although
the
chief
doctor
would
be
a
man
it
was
hoped
to
secure
several
assistant
doctors
of
the
female
sex
little
belly
dwelt
particularly
on
the
fact
that
only
women
of
unexceptionable
moral
character
would
be
allowed
to
join
the
force
all
recruits
having
to
supply
certificates
from
the
commissaries
of
police
of
their
districts
as
well
as
the
consent
of
their
nearest
connexions
such
as
their
fathers
or
their
husbands
now
listen
to
this
added
belly
enthusiastically
as
he
went
to
a
piano
which
i
was
surprised
to
find
standing
in
a
recruiting
office
and
seating
himself
at
the
instrument
he
played
for
my
especial
benefit
the
stirring
strains
of
a
new
which
said
he
we
intend
to
call
the
marseillaise
of
the
paris
amazons
unfortunately
for
belly
all
his
fine
projects
and
preparations
collapsed
a
few
days
afterwards
owing
to
the
intervention
of
the
police
who
raided
the
premises
in
the
rue
turbigo
and
carried
off
all
the
papers
they
found
there
they
justified
these
summary
proceedings
on
the
ground
that
general
trochu
had
forbidden
the
formation
of
any
more
free
corps
and
that
belly
had
unduly
taken
fees
from
his
recruits
i
believe
however
that
the
latter
statement
was
incorrect
at
all
events
no
further
proceedings
were
instituted
but
the
raid
sufficed
to
kill

legion
of
honour
nevertheless
the
french
success
was
only
momentary
that
same
night
the
sky
westward
of
paris
was
illumined
by
a
great
ruddy
glare
the
famous
château
of
saint
cloud
associated
with
many
memories
of
the
old
and
both
the
empires
was
seen
to
be
on
fire
the
cause
of
the
conflagration
has
never
been
precisely
ascertained
french
still
declare
that
the
destruction
of
the
château
was
the
wilful
act
of
the
germans
who
undoubtedly
occupied
saint
cloud
but
german
authorities
invariably
maintain
that
the
fire
was
caused
by
a
shell
from
the
french
fortress
of
mont
valérien
many
of
the
sumptuous
contents
of
the
château
of
saint
cloud
the
fatal
spot
where
that
same
war
had
been
decided
on
were
consumed
by
the
flames
while
the
remainder
were
appropriated
by
the
germans
as
plunder
many
very
valuable
paintings
of
the
period
of
louis
xiv
were
undoubtedly
destroyed
by
this
time
the
word
reconnaissance
as
applied
to
the
engagements
fought
in
the
environs
of
the
city
had
become
odious
to
the
parisians
who
began
to
clamour
for
a
real
sortie
trochu
it
may
be
said
had
at
this
period
no
idea
of
being
able
to
break
out
of
paris
in
fact
he
had
no
desire
to
do
so
his
object
in
all
the
earlier
military
operations
of
the
siege
was
simply
to
enlarge
the
circle
of
investment
in
the
hope
of
thereby
placing
the
germans
in
a
difficulty
of
which
he
might
subsequently
take
advantage
an
attack
which
general
ducrot
made
with
a
few
thousand
men
on
the
german
position
near
la
malmaison
west
of
paris
was
the
first
action
which
was
officially
described
as
a
sortie
it
took
place
on
october
but
the
success
which
at
first
attended
efforts
was
turned
into
a
repulse
by
the
arrival
of
german
reinforcements
the
affair
ending
with
a
loss
of
some
four
hundred
killed
and
wounded
on
the
french
side
apart
from
that
of
another
hundred
men
who
were
taken
prisoners
by
the
enemy
this
kind
of
thing
did
not
appeal
to
the
many
frequenters
of
the
public
clubs
which
were
established
in
the
different
quarters
of
paris
all
theatrical
performances
had
ceased
there
and
there
was
no
more
dancing
even
the
concerts
and
readings
given
in
aid
of
the
funds
for
the
wounded
were
few
and
far
between
thus
if
a
parisian
did
not
care
to
while
away
his
evening
in
a
cafe
his
only
resource
was
to
betake
himself
to
one
of
the
clubs
those
held
at
the
the
valentino
the
porte
martin
theatre
and
the
hall
of
the
collège
de
france
were
mostly
frequented
by
moderate
republicans
and
attempts
were
often
made
there
to
discuss
the
situation
in
a
sensible
manner
but
folly
even
insanity
reigned
at
many
of
the
other
clubs
where
men
like
félix
pyat
auguste
blanqui
charles
delescluze
gustave
flourens
and
the
three
ms
mégy
mottu
and
millière
raved
and
ranted
go
where
you
would
you
found
a
club
there
was
that
of
la
reine
blanche
at
montmartre
and
that
of
the
salle
favié
at
belleville
there
was
the
club
de
la
vengeance
on
the
boulevard
rochechouart
the
club
des
montagnards
on
the
boulevard
de
strasbourg
the
club
des
in
the
rue
cadet
the
club
du
in
the
rue
du
bac
the
club
de
la
cour
des
miracles
on
the
ile
saint
louis
and
twenty
or
thirty
others
of
lesser
note
at
times
the
demagogues
who
perorated
from
the
tribunes
at
these
gatherings
brought
forward
proposals
which
seemed
to
have
emanated
from
some
madhouse
but
which
were
nevertheless
hailed
with
delirious
applause
by
their
infatuated
audiences
occasionally
new
engines
of
destruction
were
advocated
or
pumps
discharging
flaming
petroleum
another
speaker
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
of
keeping
all
the
wild
beasts
in
the
jardin
des
plantes
on
short
commons
for
some
days
then
removing
them
from
paris
at
the
next
sortie
and
casting
them
adrift
among
the
enemy
yet
another
imbecile
suggested
that
the
water
of
the
seine
and
the
marne
should
be
poisoned
regardless
of
the
fact
that
in
any
such
event
the
parisians
would
suffer
quite
as
much
as
the
enemy
but
the
malcontents
were
not
satisfied
with
ranting
at
the
clubs
on
october
paris
became
very
gloomy
for
we
then
received
from
outside
the
news
that
both
toul
and
strasbourg
had
surrendered
three
days
later
gustave
flourens
gathered
the
national
guards
of
belleville
together
and
marched
with
them
on
the
where
he
called
upon
the
government
to
renounce
the
military
tactics
of
the
empire
which
had
set
one
frenchman
against
three
germans
to
decree
a
en
to
make
frequent
sorties
with
the
national
guards
to
arm
the
latter
with
chassepots
and
to
establish
at
once
a
municipal
commune
of
paris
on
the
subject
of
sorties
the
government
promised
to
conform
to
the
general
desire
and
to
allow
the
national
guards
to
with
the
regular
army
as
soon
as
they
should
know
how
to
fight
and
escape
being
simply
butchered
to
other
demands
made
by
flourens
evasive
replies
were
returned
whereupon
he
indignantly
resigned
his
command
of
the
belleville
men
but
resumed
it
at
their
urgent
request
the
affair
somewhat
alarmed
the
government
who
issued
a
proclamation
forbidding
armed
demonstrations
and
far
from
consenting
to
the
establishment
of
any
commune
postponed
the
ordinary
municipal
elections
which
were
soon
to
have
taken
place
to
this
the
reds
retorted
by
making
yet
another
demonstration
which
my
father
and
myself
witnessed
thousands
of
people
many
of
them
being
armed
national
guards
assembled
on
the
place
de
de
ville
shouting
la
commune
la
commune
nous
voulons
la
commune
but
the
authorities
had
received
warning
of
their
intentions
and
the
was
entirely
surrounded
by
national
guards
belonging
to
loyal
battalions
behind
whom
moreover
was
stationed
a
force
of
trusty
mobile
guards
whose
bayonets
were
already
fixed
thus
no
attempt
could
be
made
to
raid
the
with
any
chance
of
success
further
several
other
contingents
of
loyal
national
guards
arrived
on
the
square
and
helped
to
check
the
demonstrators
while
gazing
on
the
scene
from
an
upper
window
of
the
cafe
de
la
garde
nationale
at
one
corner
of
the
square
i
suddenly
saw
trochu
ride
out
of
the
government
building
as
it
then
was
followed
by
a
couple
of
his
appearance
was
attended
by
a
fresh
uproar
the
yells
of
la
commune
la
commune
rose
more
loudly
than
ever
but
were
now
answered
by
determined
shouts
of
vive
la
republique
vive
trochu
vive
le
gouvernement
whilst
the
drums
beat
the
trumpets
sounded
and
all
the
government
forces
presented
arms
the
general
rode
up
and
down
the
lines
returning
the
salute
amidst
prolonged
acclamations
and
presently
his
colleagues
jules
favre
and
the
others
excepting
of
course
gambetta
who
had
already
left
paris
also
came
out
of
the
and
received
an
enthusiastic
greeting
from
their
supporters
for
the
time
the
reds
were
absolutely
defeated
and
in
order
to
prevent
similar
disturbances
in
future
keratry
the
prefect
of
police
wished
to
arrest
flourens
blanqui
milliere
and
others
which
suggestion
was
countenanced
by
trochu
but
opposed
by
rochefort
and
etienne
arago
a
few
days
later
rochefort
patched
up
a
brief
outward
reconciliation
between
the
contending
parties
nevertheless
it
was
evident
that
paris
was
already
sharply
divided
both
on
the
question
of
its
defence
and
on
that
of
its
internal
government
on
october
some
of
the
national
guards
were
at
last
allowed
to
join
in
a
sortie
they
were
men
from
montmartre
and
the
action
or
rather
skirmish
in
which
they
participated
took
place
at
villemomble
east
of
paris
the
guards
behaving
fairly
well
under
fire
and
having
five
of
their
number
wounded
patriotism
was
now
taking
another
form
in
the
city
there
was
a
loud
cry
for
cannons
more
and
more
cannons
the
government
replied
that
mitrailleuses
with
over
cartridges
mortars
carriages
for
siege
guns
several
of
the
latter
ordnance
and
guns
carrying
yards
together
with
half
a
million
shells
of
different
sizes
had
already
been
ordered
and
in
part
delivered
nevertheless
public
subscriptions
were
started
in
order
to
provide
another
cannon
large
sums
being
contributed
to
the
fund
by
public
bodies
and
business
firms
not
only
did
the
newspapers
offer
to
collect
small
subscriptions
but
stalls
were
set
up
for
that
purpose
in
different
parts
of
paris
as
in
the
time
of
the
first
revolution
and
people
there
tendered
their
contributions
the
women
often
offering
jewelry
in
lieu
of
money
trochu
however
deprecated
the
movement
there
were
already
plenty
of
guns
said
he
what
he
required
was
gunners
to
serve
them
on
october
we
heard
of
the
fall
of
the
little
town
of
châteaudun
in
after
a
gallant
resistance
offered
by
national
guards
and
against
german
infantry
a
regiment
of
cavalry
and
four
field
batteries
von
wittich
the
german
general
punished
that
resistance
by
setting
fire
to
châteaudun
and
a
couple
of
adjacent
villages
and
his
men
moreover
massacred
a
number
of
civilians
nevertheless
the
courage
shown
by
the
people
of
châteaudun
revived
the
hopes
of
the
parisians
and
strengthened
their
resolution
to
brave
every
hardship
rather
than
surrender
two
days
later
however
félix
pyat
journal
published
within
a
mourning
border
the
following
announcement
it
is
a
sure
and
certain
fact
that
the
government
of
national
defence
retains
in
its
possession
a
state
secret
which
we
denounce
to
an
indignant
country
as
high
treason
marshal
bazaine
has
sent
a
colonel
to
the
camp
of
the
king
of
prussia
to
treat
for
the
surrender
of
metz
and
for
peace
in
the
name
of
napoleon
iii
the
news
seemed
incredible
and
indeed
at
the
first
moment
very
few
people
believed
it
if
it
were
true
however
prince
frederick
forces
released
from
the
siege
of
metz
would
evidently
be
able
to
march
against
de
paladines
army
of
the
loire
just
when
it
was
hoped
that
the
latter
would
overthrow
the
bavarians
under
von
der
tann
and
hasten
to
the
relief
of
paris
but
people
argued
that
bazaine
was
surely
as
good
a
patriot
as
bourbaki
who
it
was
already
known
had
escaped
from
metz
and
offered
his
sword
to
the
national
defence
in
the
provinces
a
number
of
indignant
citizens
hastened
to
the
office
of
in
order
to
seize
pyat
and
consign
him
to
durance
but
he
was
an
adept
in
the
art
of
escaping
arrest
and
contrived
to
get
away
by
a
back
door
at
the
rochefort
on
being
interviewed
described
pyat
as
a
cur
and
declared
that
there
was
no
truth
whatever
in
his
story
public
confidence
completely
revived
on
the
following
morning
when
the
official
journal
formally
declared
that
metz
had
not
capitulated
and
in
the
evening
paris
became
quite
jubilant
at
the
news
that
general
carré
de
bellemare
who
commanded
on
the
north
side
of
the
city
had
wrested
from
the
germans
the
position
of
le
bourget
lying
to
the
east
of
saint
denis
pyat
however
though
he
remained
in
hiding
clung
to
his
story
respecting
metz
stating
in
on
october
that
the
news
had
been
communicated
to
him
by
gustave
flourens
who
had
derived
it
from
rochefort
by
whom
it
was
now
impudently
denied
it
subsequently
became
known
moreover
that
another
member
of
the
government
eugène
pelletan
had
confided
the
same
intelligence
to
commander
longuet
of
the
national
guard
it
appears
that
it
had
originally
been
derived
from
certain
members
of
the
red
cross
society
who
when
it
became
necessary
to
bury
the
dead
and
tend
the
wounded
after
an
encounter
in
the
environs
of
paris
often
came
in
contact
with
the
germans
the
report
was
of
course
limited
to
the
statement
that
bazaine
was
negotiating
a
surrender
not
that
he
had
actually
capitulated
the
government
denial
of
it
can
only
be
described
as
a
quibble
of
the
kind
to
which
at
times
even
british
governments
stoop
when
faced
by
inconvenient
questions
in
the
house
of
commons
and
as
we
shall
soon
see
the
gentlemen
of
the
national
defence
spent
a
mauvais
quart
as
a
result
of
the
of
which
they
were
guilty
similar
bad
quarters
of
an
hour
have
fallen
upon
politicians
in
other
countries
including
our
own
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
on
october
thiers
after
travelling
all
over
europe
pleading
his
country
cause
at
every
great
court
arrived
in
paris
with
a
from
bismarck
in
order
to
lay
before
the
government
certain
proposals
for
an
armistice
which
russia
great
britain
austria
and
italy
were
prepared
to
support
and
alas
he
also
brought
with
him
the
news
that
metz
had
actually
fallen
having
capitulated
indeed
on
october
the
very
day
on
which
pyat
had
issued
his
announcement
there
was
consternation
at
the
when
this
became
known
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
government
deeply
but
vainly
regretted
the
futile
tactics
to
which
they
had
so
foolishly
stooped
to
make
matters
worse
we
received
in
the
evening
intelligence
that
the
germans
had
driven
carré
de
bellemare
men
out
of
le
bourget
after
some
brief
but
desperate
fighting
trochu
declared
that
he
had
no
need
of
the
bourget
position
that
it
had
never
entered
into
his
scheme
of
defence
and
that
bellemare
had
been
unduly
zealous
in
attacking
and
taking
it
from
the
germans
if
that
were
the
case
however
why
had
not
the
governor
of
paris
ordered
le
bourget
to
be
evacuated
immediately
after
its
capture
without
waiting
for
the
germans
to
it
at
the
bayonet
point
under
the
circumstances
the
parisians
were
naturally
exasperated
tumultuous
were
the
scenes
on
the
boulevards
that
evening
and
vehement
and
threatening
were
the
speeches
at
the
clubs
when
the
parisians
quitted
their
homes
on
the
morning
of
monday
the
they
found
the
city
placarded
with
two
official
notices
one
respecting
the
arrival
of
thiers
and
the
proposals
for
an
armistice
and
the
second
acknowledging
the
disaster
of
metz
a
hurricane
of
indignation
at
once
swept
through
the
city
le
bourget
lost
metz
taken
proposals
for
an
armistice
with
the
detested
prussians
entertained
could
trochu
plan
and
bazaine
plan
be
synonymous
then
the
one
word
treachery
was
on
every
lip
when
noon
arrived
the
place
de
was
crowded
with
indignant
people
deputations
composed
chiefly
of
officers
of
the
national
guard
interviewed
the
government
and
were
by
no
means
satisfied
with
the
replies
which
they
received
from
jules
ferry
and
others
meantime
the
crowd
on
the
square
was
increasing
in
numbers
several
members
of
the
government
attempted
to
prevail
on
it
to
disperse
but
no
heed
was
paid
to
them
at
last
a
free
corps
commanded
by
tibaldi
an
italian
conspirator
of
imperial
days
effected
an
entrance
into
the
followed
by
a
good
many
of
the
mob
in
the
they
were
met
by
jules
favre
whose
attempts
to
address
them
failed
the
shouts
of
la
commune
la
commune
speedily
drowning
his
voice
meantime
two
shots
were
fired
by
somebody
on
the
square
a
window
was
broken
and
the
cry
of
the
invaders
became
to
arms
to
arms
our
brothers
are
being
butchered
in
vain
did
trochu
and
rochefort
endeavour
to
stem
the
tide
of
invasion
in
vain
also
did
the
government
assembled
in
the
offer
to
submit
itself
to
the
suffrages
of
the
citizens
to
grant
the
election
of
municipal
councillors
and
to
promise
that
no
armistice
should
be
signed
without
consulting
the
population
the
mob
pressed
on
through
one
room
after
another
smashing
tables
desks
and
windows
on
their
way
and
all
at
once
the
very
apartment
where
the
government
were
deliberating
was
in
its
turn
invaded
several
officers
of
the
national
guard
subsequently
prominent
at
the
time
of
the
commune
heading
the
intruders
and
demanding
the
election
of
a
commune
and
the
appointment
of
a
new
administration
under
the
presidency
of
dorian
the
popular
minister
of
public
works
amidst
the
ensuing
confusion
ernest
picard
a
very
corpulent
advocate
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
department
of
finances
contrived
to
escape
but
all
his
colleagues
were
surrounded
insulted
by
the
invaders
and
summoned
to
resign
their
posts
they
refused
to
do
so
and
the
wrangle
was
still
at
its
height
when
gustave
flourens
and
his
belleville
sharpshooters
reached
the
place
de
flourens
entered
the
building
which
at
this
moment
was
occupied
by
some
seven
or
eight
thousand
men
and
proposed
that
the
commune
should
be
elected
by
acclamation
this
was
agreed
upon
dorian
name
though
by
the
way
he
was
a
wealthy
ironmaster
and
in
no
sense
a
communard
being
put
at
the
head
of
the
list
this
included
flourens
himself
victor
hugo
louis
blanc
raspail
mottu
delescluze
blanqui
rochefort
félix
pyat
ranvier
and
avrial
then
flourens
in
his
turn
entered
the
climbed
on
to
the
table
and
summoned
the
captive
members
of
the
government
to
resign
again
they
refused
to
do
so
and
were
therefore
placed
under
arrest
jules
ferry
and
emmanuel
arago
managed
to
escape
however
and
some
friendly
national
guards
succeeded
in
entering
the
building
and
carrying
off
general
trochu
ernest
picard
meanwhile
had
been
very
active
in
devising
plans
for
the
recapture
of
the
and
providing
for
the
safety
of
various
government
departments
thus
when
flourens
sent
a
lieutenant
to
the
treasury
demanding
the
immediate
payment
of
the
request
was
refused
and
the
messenger
placed
under
arrest
nevertheless
the
insurgents
made
themselves
masters
of
several
district
but
jules
ferry
was
collecting
the
loyal
national
guards
together
and
at
eleven
that
night
they
and
some
mobiles
marched
on
the
the
military
force
which
had
been
left
there
by
the
insurgents
was
not
large
a
parley
ensued
and
while
it
was
still
in
progress
an
entire
battalion
of
mobiles
effected
an
entry
by
a
subterranean
passage
leading
from
an
adjacent
barracks
delescluze
and
flourens
then
tried
to
arrange
terms
with
dorian
but
jules
ferry
would
accept
no
conditions
the
imprisoned
members
of
the
government
were
released
and
the
insurgent
leaders
compelled
to
retire
about
this
time
trochu
and
ducrot
arrived
on
the
scene
and
between
three
and
four
in
the
morning
i
saw
them
pass
the
government
forces
in
review
on
the
square
on
the
following
day
all
the
alleged
conventions
between
dorian
and
the
red
republican
leaders
were
disavowed
there
was
however
a
conflict
of
opinion
as
to
whether
those
leaders
should
be
arrested
or
not
some
members
of
the
government
admitting
that
they
had
promised
delescluze
and
others
that
they
should
not
be
prosecuted
in
consequence
of
this
dispute
several
officials
including
edmond
adam
keratry
successor
as
prefect
of
police
resigned
their
functions
a
few
days
later
of
the
insurgent
leaders
were
arrested
pyat
being
among
them
though
nothing
was
done
in
regard
to
flourens
and
blanqui
both
of
whom
had
figured
prominently
in
the
affair
on
november
we
had
a
plebiscitum
the
question
put
to
the
parisians
being
does
the
population
of
paris
yes
or
no
maintain
the
powers
of
the
government
of
national
defence
so
far
as
the
civilian
element
which
included
the
national
guards
was
concerned
the
ballot
resulted
as
follows
voting
yes
citizens
voting
no
citizens
the
vote
of
the
army
inclusive
of
the
mobile
guard
was
even
more
pronounced
yes
no
thus
the
general
result
was
votes
in
favour
of
the
government
and
against
it
the
proportion
being
to
for
the
entire
male
population
of
the
invested
circle
this
naturally
rendered
the
authorities
jubilant
but
the
affair
of
october
had
deplorable
consequences
with
regard
to
the
armistice
negotiations
this
explosion
of
sedition
alarmed
the
german
authorities
they
lost
confidence
in
the
power
of
the
national
defence
to
carry
out
such
terms
as
might
be
stipulated
and
finally
bismarck
refused
to
allow
paris
to
be
revictualled
during
the
period
requisite
for
the
election
of
a
legislative
assembly
which
was
to
have
decided
the
question
of
peace
or
war
unless
one
fort
and
possibly
more
than
one
were
surrendered
to
him
thiers
and
favre
could
not
accept
such
a
condition
and
thus
the
negotiations
were
broken
off
before
thiers
quitted
bismarck
however
the
latter
significantly
told
him
that
the
terms
of
peace
at
that
juncture
would
be
the
cession
of
alsace
to
germany
and
the
payment
of
three
milliards
of
francs
as
an
indemnity
but
that
after
the
fall
of
paris
the
terms
would
be
the
cession
of
both
alsace
and
lorraine
and
a
payment
of
five
milliards
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
siege
there
was
no
rationing
of
provisions
though
the
price
of
meat
was
fixed
by
government
decree
at
the
end
of
september
however
the
authorities
decided
to
limit
the
supply
to
a
maximum
of
oxen
and
sheep
per
diem
it
was
decided
also
that
the
butchers
shops
should
only
open
on
every
fourth
day
when
four
days
meat
should
be
distributed
at
the
official
prices
during
the
earlier
period
the
daily
ration
ranged
from
to
grammes
that
is
about
oz
to
oz
in
weight
part
of
it
being
bone
in
the
case
of
beef
though
with
respect
to
mutton
the
butchers
were
forbidden
to
make
up
the
weight
with
any
bones
which
did
not
adhere
to
the
meat
at
the
outset
of
the
siege
only
twenty
or
thirty
horses
were
slaughtered
each
day
but
on
september
the
number
had
risen
to
a
week
later
there
were
nearly
thirty
shops
in
paris
where
horseflesh
was
exclusively
sold
and
scarcely
a
day
elapsed
without
an
increase
in
their
number
eventually
horseflesh
became
virtually
the
only
meat
procurable
by
all
classes
of
the
besieged
but
in
the
earlier
period
it
was
patronized
chiefly
by
the
poorer
folk
the
prices
fixed
for
it
by
authority
being
naturally
lower
than
those
edicted
for
beef
and
mutton
with
regard
to
the
arrangements
made
by
my
father
and
myself
respecting
food
they
were
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
siege
very
simple
we
were
keeping
no
servant
at
our
flat
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
the
concierge
of
the
house
and
his
wife
did
all
such
work
as
we
required
this
concierge
whose
name
was
saby
had
been
a
zouave
and
had
acted
as
orderly
to
his
captain
in
algeria
he
was
personally
expert
in
the
art
of
preparing
couscoussou
and
other
algerian
dishes
and
his
wife
was
a
thoroughly
good
cook
la
directly
meat
was
rationed
saby
said
to
me
the
allowance
is
very
small
you
and
monsieur
votre
père
will
be
able
to
eat
a
good
deal
more
than
that
now
some
of
the
poorer
folk
can
not
afford
to
pay
for
butchers
meat
they
are
contented
with
horseflesh
which
is
not
yet
rationed
and
are
willing
to
sell
their
ration
cards
you
can
well
afford
to
buy
one
or
two
of
them
and
in
that
manner
secure
extra
allowances
of
beef
or
mutton
that
plan
was
adopted
and
for
a
time
everything
went
on
satisfactorily
on
a
few
occasions
i
joined
the
queue
outside
our
butcher
in
the
rue
de
penthièvre
and
waited
an
hour
or
two
to
secure
our
share
of
meat
we
were
not
in
that
part
of
paris
a
great
many
members
of
the
aristocracy
and
bourgeoisie
who
usually
dwelt
there
had
left
the
city
with
their
families
and
servants
prior
to
the
investment
and
thus
the
queues
and
the
waits
were
not
so
long
as
in
the
poorer
and
more
densely
populated
districts
saby
however
often
procured
our
meat
himself
or
employed
somebody
else
to
do
so
for
women
were
heartily
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
earn
half
a
franc
or
so
by
acting
as
deputy
for
other
people
we
had
secured
a
small
supply
of
tinned
provisions
and
would
have
increased
it
if
the
prices
had
not
gone
up
by
leaps
and
bounds
in
such
wise
that
a
tin
of
corned
beef
or
something
similar
which
one
saw
priced
in
the
morning
at
about
francs
was
labelled
francs
a
few
hours
later
dry
beans
and
peas
were
still
easily
procurable
but
fresh
vegetables
at
once
became
both
rare
and
costly
potatoes
failed
us
at
an
early
date
on
the
other
hand
jam
and
preserved
fruit
could
be
readily
obtained
at
the
grocer
at
the
corner
of
our
street
the
bread
slowly
deteriorated
in
quality
but
was
still
very
fair
down
to
the
date
of
my
departure
from
paris
november
see
the
following
milk
and
butter
however
became
rare
the
former
being
reserved
for
the
hospitals
the
ambulances
the
mothers
of
infants
and
so
forth
whilst
one
sighed
in
vain
for
a
bit
of
gruyère
roquefort
brie
or
indeed
any
other
cheese
saby
who
was
a
very
shrewd
fellow
had
conceived
a
brilliant
idea
before
the
siege
actually
began
the
chateaubriands
having
quitted
the
house
and
removed
their
horses
from
the
stables
he
took
possession
of
the
latter
purchased
some
rabbits
several
does
and
a
couple
of
bucks
laid
in
a
supply
of
food
for
them
and
resolved
to
make
his
fortune
by
he
did
not
quite
effect
his
purpose
but
rabbits
are
so
prolific
that
he
was
repaid
many
times
over
for
the
trouble
which
he
took
in
rearing
them
for
some
time
he
kept
the
affair
quite
secret
more
than
once
i
saw
him
going
in
and
out
of
the
stables
without
guessing
the
reason
but
one
morning
having
occasion
to
speak
to
him
i
followed
him
and
discovered
the
truth
he
certainly
bred
several
scores
of
rabbits
during
the
course
of
the
siege
merely
ceasing
to
do
so
when
he
found
it
impossible
to
continue
feeding
the
animals
on
two
or
three
occasions
we
paid
him
ten
francs
or
so
for
a
rabbit
and
that
was
certainly
treatment
for
at
the
same
period
he
was
charging
twenty
and
francs
to
other
people
cooks
with
whom
he
communicated
came
to
him
from
mansions
both
near
and
far
he
sold
quite
a
number
of
rabbits
to
baron
alphonse
de
rothschild
at
the
rate
of
apiece
and
others
to
count
at
about
the
same
price
so
that
so
far
as
his
pockets
were
concerned
he
in
no
wise
suffered
by
the
siege
of
paris
we
were
blessed
with
an
abundance
of
charcoal
for
cooking
purposes
and
of
coals
and
wood
for
ordinary
fires
having
at
our
disposal
not
only
the
store
in
our
own
cellars
but
that
which
the
chateaubriand
family
had
left
behind
the
cold
weather
set
in
very
soon
and
firing
was
speedily
in
great
demand
our
artist
jules
pelcoq
who
lived
in
the
rue
lepic
at
montmartre
found
himself
reduced
to
great
straits
in
this
respect
nothing
being
procurable
at
the
dealers
excepting
virtually
green
wood
which
had
been
felled
a
short
time
previously
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
bois
de
vincennes
on
a
couple
of
occasions
pelcoq
and
i
carried
some
coals
in
bags
to
his
flat
and
my
father
being
anxious
for
his
comfort
wished
to
provide
him
with
a
larger
supply
saby
was
therefore
requisitioned
to
procure
a
man
who
would
undertake
to
convey
some
coals
in
a
handcart
to
montmartre
the
man
was
found
and
paid
for
his
services
in
advance
but
alas
the
coals
never
reached
poor
pelcoq
when
we
next
saw
the
man
who
had
been
engaged
he
told
us
that
he
had
been
intercepted
on
his
way
by
some
national
guards
who
had
asked
him
what
his
load
was
and
on
discovering
that
it
consisted
of
coals
had
promptly
confiscated
them
and
the
barrow
also
dragging
the
latter
to
some
bivouac
on
the
ramparts
i
have
always
doubted
that
story
however
and
incline
to
the
opinion
that
our
improvised
porter
had
simply
sold
the
coals
and
pocketed
the
proceeds
one
day
early
in
november
when
our
allowance
of
beef
or
mutton
was
growing
small
by
degrees
and
beautifully
less
and
infrequent
horseflesh
becoming
more
and
more
at
the
butchers
shops
only
oz
of
beef
or
mutton
was
now
allowed
per
diem
but
in
lieu
thereof
you
could
obtain
lb
of
horseflesh
i
had
occasion
to
call
on
one
of
our
artists
blanchard
who
lived
in
the
faubourg
saint
germain
when
we
had
finished
our
business
he
said
to
me
ernest
it
is
my
day
i
am
going
to
have
a
superb
dinner
my
who
is
an
official
of
the
eastern
railway
line
is
giving
it
in
my
honour
come
with
me
i
invite
you
we
thereupon
went
to
his
flat
where
i
was
most
cordially
received
and
before
long
we
sat
down
at
table
in
a
warm
and
the
company
consisting
of
two
ladies
and
three
men
myself
included
the
soup
i
think
had
been
prepared
from
horseflesh
with
the
addition
of
a
little
liebig
extract
of
meat
but
it
was
followed
by
a
beautiful
leg
of
mutton
with
beans
a
la
bretonne
and
potatoes
i
had
not
tasted
a
potato
for
weeks
past
for
in
vain
had
the
ingenious
saby
endeavoured
to
procure
some
but
the
crowning
triumph
of
the
evening
was
the
appearance
of
a
huge
piece
of
gruyère
cheese
which
at
that
time
was
not
to
be
seen
in
a
single
shop
in
paris
even
chevet
that
renowned
purveyor
of
dainties
had
declared
that
he
had
none
my
surprise
in
presence
of
the
cheese
and
the
potatoes
being
evident
blanchard
blandly
informed
me
that
he
had
stolen
them
there
is
no
doubt
said
he
that
many
tradespeople
hold
secret
stores
of
one
thing
and
another
but
wish
prices
to
rise
still
higher
than
they
are
before
they
produce
them
i
did
not
however
take
those
potatoes
or
that
cheese
from
any
shopkeeper
cellar
but
in
the
of
the
railway
company
to
which
i
belong
there
are
tons
and
tons
of
provisions
including
both
cheese
and
potatoes
for
which
the
consignees
never
apply
preferring
as
they
do
to
leave
them
there
until
famine
prices
are
reached
well
i
have
helped
myself
to
just
a
few
things
so
as
to
give
blanchard
a
good
dinner
this
evening
as
for
the
leg
of
mutton
i
bribed
the
butcher
not
with
money
he
might
have
refused
it
but
with
cheese
and
potatoes
and
it
was
fair
exchange
when
i
returned
home
that
evening
i
carried
in
my
pockets
more
than
half
a
pound
of
gruyère
and
two
or
three
pounds
of
potatoes
which
my
father
heartily
welcomed
the
truth
about
the
provisions
which
were
still
stored
at
some
of
the
railway
dépôts
was
soon
afterwards
revealed
to
the
authorities
although
my
father
was
then
only
fifty
years
of
age
and
had
plenty
of
nervous
energy
his
health
was
at
least
momentarily
failing
him
he
had
led
an
extremely
strenuous
life
ever
since
his
twentieth
year
when
my
grandfather
death
had
cast
great
responsibilities
on
him
he
had
also
suffered
from
illnesses
which
required
that
he
should
have
an
ample
supply
of
nourishing
food
so
long
as
a
fair
amount
of
ordinary
butcher
meat
could
be
procured
he
did
not
complain
but
when
it
came
to
eating
horseflesh
two
or
three
times
a
week
he
could
not
undertake
it
although
only
a
year
or
two
previously
he
had
attended
a
great
given
in
paris
and
had
then
even
written
favourably
of
de
in
an
article
he
prepared
on
the
subject
for
my
own
part
being
a
mere
lad
i
had
a
lad
appetite
and
stomach
and
i
did
not
find
horseflesh
so
much
amiss
particularly
as
prepared
with
garlic
and
other
savouries
by
mme
saby
expert
hands
but
after
a
day
or
two
my
father
refused
to
touch
it
for
three
days
i
remember
he
tried
to
live
on
bread
jam
and
preserved
fruit
but
the
sweetness
of
such
a
diet
became
nauseous
to
him
even
as
it
became
nauseous
to
our
soldiers
when
the
authorities
bombarded
them
with
jam
in
south
africa
it
was
very
difficult
to
provide
something
to
my
father
taste
there
was
no
poultry
and
there
were
no
eggs
it
was
at
this
time
that
saby
sold
us
a
few
rabbits
but
again
was
not
satisfactory
people
were
now
beginning
to
partake
of
sundry
strange
things
bats
were
certainly
eaten
before
the
siege
ended
though
by
no
means
in
such
quantities
as
some
have
asserted
however
there
were
already
places
where
dogs
and
cats
skinned
and
prepared
for
cooking
were
openly
displayed
for
sale
labouchere
related
also
that
on
going
one
day
into
a
restaurant
and
seeing
de
otherwise
mentioned
in
the
menu
he
summoned
the
waiter
and
him
on
the
subject
as
he
greatly
doubted
whether
there
were
any
in
all
paris
is
it
he
asked
the
waiter
yes
monsieur
the
man
replied
but
labby
was
not
convinced
is
it
a
little
pig
he
inquired
yes
monsieur
quite
a
little
one
is
it
a
young
pig
pursued
labby
who
was
still
dubious
the
waiter
hesitated
and
at
last
replied
well
i
can
not
be
sure
monsieur
if
it
is
quite
young
but
it
must
be
young
if
it
is
little
as
you
say
come
what
is
it
tell
me
monsieur
it
is
a
labby
bounded
from
his
chair
took
his
hat
and
fled
he
did
not
feel
equal
to
although
he
was
very
hungry
perhaps
however
labouchere
best
story
of
those
days
was
that
of
the
old
couple
who
all
other
resources
failing
them
were
at
last
compelled
to
sacrifice
their
little
pet
dog
it
came
up
to
table
nicely
roasted
and
they
both
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
with
a
sigh
then
monsieur
summoned
up
his
courage
and
helped
madame
to
the
tender
viand
she
heaved
another
sigh
but
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
began
to
eat
and
whilst
she
was
doing
so
she
every
now
and
then
deposited
a
little
bone
on
the
edge
of
her
plate
there
was
quite
a
collection
of
little
bones
there
by
the
time
she
had
finished
and
as
she
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
contemplated
them
she
suddenly
exclaimed
poor
little
toto
if
he
had
only
been
alive
what
a
fine
treat
he
would
have
had
to
return
however
to
my
father
and
myself
i
must
mention
that
there
was
a
little
english
tavern
and
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
kept
by
a
man
named
lark
with
whom
i
had
some
acquaintance
we
occasionally
procured
english
ale
from
him
and
one
day
late
in
october
when
i
was
passing
his
establishment
he
said
to
me
how
is
your
father
he
seems
to
be
looking
poorly
are
you
going
to
leave
with
the
others
i
inquired
of
lark
what
he
meant
by
his
last
question
whereupon
he
told
me
that
if
i
went
to
the
embassy
i
should
see
a
notice
in
the
consular
office
respecting
the
departure
of
british
subjects
arrangements
having
been
made
to
enable
all
who
desired
to
quit
paris
to
do
so
i
took
the
hint
and
read
the
notice
which
ran
as
lark
had
stated
with
this
addendum
the
embassy
however
charge
itself
with
the
expense
of
assisting
british
subjects
to
leave
paris
forthwith
i
returned
home
and
imparted
the
information
i
had
obtained
to
my
father
beyond
setting
up
that
notice
in
the
consul
office
the
embassy
took
no
steps
to
acquaint
british
subjects
generally
with
the
opportunity
which
was
offered
them
to
escape
bombardment
and
famine
it
is
true
that
it
was
in
touch
with
the
british
charitable
fund
and
that
the
latter
made
the
matter
known
to
sundry
applicants
for
assistance
but
the
british
colony
still
numbered
people
hundreds
of
whom
would
have
availed
themselves
of
this
opportunity
had
it
only
come
to
their
knowledge
my
father
speedily
made
up
his
mind
to
quit
the
city
and
during
the
next
few
days
arrangements
were
made
with
our
artists
and
others
so
that
the
interests
of
the
london
might
in
no
degree
suffer
by
his
absence
our
system
had
long
been
perfected
and
everything
worked
well
after
our
departure
i
may
add
here
because
it
will
explain
something
which
follows
that
my
father
distributed
all
the
money
he
could
possibly
spare
among
those
whom
he
left
behind
in
such
wise
that
on
quitting
paris
we
had
comparatively
little
and
as
the
sequel
showed
insufficient
money
with
us
but
it
was
thought
that
we
should
be
able
to
secure
whatever
we
might
require
on
arriving
at
versailles
vii
from
paris
to

since
lord

departure

the

had
remained
in
the
charge
of
the
second
secretary
wodehouse
and
the
in
response
to
the
notice
set
up
in
the
latter
office
and
circulated
also
among
a
tithe
of
the
community
by
the
british
charitable
fund
it
was
arranged
that
sixty
or
seventy
persons
should
accompany
the
secretary
and
out
of
the
city
the
military
attacheé
colonel
claremont
alone
remaining
there
the
provision
which
the
charitable
fund
made
for
the
poorer
folk
consisted
of
a
donation
of
to
each
person
together
with
some
three
pounds
of
biscuits
and
a
few
ounces
of
chocolate
to
munch
on
the
way
no
means
of
transport
however
were
provided
for
these
people
though
it
was
known
that
we
should
have
to
proceed
to
versailles
where
the
german
headquarters
were
installed
by
a
very
circuitous
route
and
that
the
railway
lines
were
out
we
were
to
have
left
on
november
at
the
same
time
as
a
number
of
americans
russians
and
others
and
it
had
been
arranged
that
everybody
should
meet
at
an
early
hour
that
morning
at
the
charenton
gate
on
the
side
of
paris
on
arriving
there
however
all
the
english
who
joined
the
gathering
were
ordered
to
turn
back
as
information
had
been
received
that
permission
to
leave
the
city
was
refused
them
this
caused
no
little
consternation
among
the
party
but
the
order
naturally
had
to
be
obeyed
and
half
angrily
and
half
disconsolately
many
a
disappointed
briton
returned
to
his
recent
quarters
we
afterwards
learnt
that
jules
favre
the
foreign
minister
had
in
the
first
instance
absolutely
refused
to
listen
to
the
applications
of
wodehouse
possibly
because
great
britain
had
not
recognized
the
french
republic
though
if
such
were
indeed
the
reason
it
was
difficult
to
understand
why
the
russians
received
very
different
treatment
as
the
czar
like
the
queen
had
so
far
abstained
from
any
official
recognition
of
the
national
defence
on
the
other
hand
favre
may
perhaps
have
shared
the
opinion
of
bismarck
who
about
this
time
tersely
expressed
his
opinion
of
ourselves
in
the
words
england
no
longer
counts
so
low
to
his
thinking
had
we
fallen
in
the
comity
of
nations
under
our
gladstone
granville
administration
wodehouse
however
in
his
unpleasant
predicament
sought
the
assistance
of
his
colleague
washburne
the
united
states
minister
and
the
latter
who
possessed
more
influence
in
paris
than
any
other
foreign
representative
promptly
put
his
foot
down
declaring
that
he
himself
would
leave
the
city
if
the
british
subjects
were
still
refused
permission
to
depart
favre
then
ungraciously
gave
way
but
no
sooner
had
his
assent
been
obtained
than
it
was
discovered
that
the
british
foreign
office
had
neglected
to
apply
to
bismarck
for
permission
for
the
english
leaving
paris
to
pass
through
the
german
lines
thus
delay
ensued
and
it
was
only
on
the
morning
of
november
that
the
english
departed
at
the
same
time
as
a
number
of
swiss
citizens
and
austrian
subjects
the
charenton
gate
was
again
the
appointed
on
our
way
thither
between
six
and
seven
in
the
morning
we
passed
many
a
long
queue
waiting
outside
butchers
shops
for
pittances
of
meat
and
outside
certain
municipal
dépôts
where
after
prolonged
waiting
a
few
thimblesful
of
milk
were
doled
out
to
those
who
could
prove
that
they
had
young
children
near
the
porte
de
charenton
a
considerable
detachment
of
the
national
guard
was
drawn
up
as
if
to
impart
a
kind
of
solemnity
to
the
approaching
exodus
of
foreigners
a
couple
of
young
were
also
in
attendance
with
a
mounted
trumpeter
and
another
trooper
carrying
the
usual
white
flag
on
a
lance
the
of
our
party
were
in
vehicles
purchased
for
the
occasion
a
few
also
being
mounted
on
valuable
horses
which
it
was
desired
to
save
from
the
fate
which
eventually
overtook
most
of
the
animals
that
remained
in
paris
others
were
in
hired
cabs
which
were
not
allowed
however
to
proceed
farther
than
the
outposts
while
a
good
many
of
the
poorer
members
of
the
party
were
in
specially
engaged
omnibuses
which
also
had
to
turn
back
before
we
were
handed
over
to
a
german
escort
the
result
being
that
their
occupants
were
left
to
trudge
a
good
many
miles
on
foot
before
other
means
of
transport
were
procured
in
that
respect
the
swiss
and
the
austrians
were
far
better
than
the
english
although
the
weather
was
bitterly
cold
wodehouse
my
father
myself
a
couple
of
wodehouse
servants
and
a
young
fellow
who
had
been
connected
i
think
with
a
paris
travelled
in
an
open
break
the
and
his
wife
who
were
also
accompanying
us
occupied
a
small
private
omnibus
before
passing
out
of
paris
we
were
all
mustered
and
our
were
examined
those
held
by
british
subjects
emanated
invariably
from
the
united
states
embassy
being
duly
signed
by
washburne
so
that
we
quitted
the
city
virtually
as
american
citizens
at
last
the
procession
was
formed
the
english
preceding
the
swiss
and
the
austrians
whilst
in
the
rear
strangely
enough
came
several
ambulance
vans
flaunting
the
red
cross
of
geneva
nobody
could
account
for
their
presence
with
us
but
as
the
germans
were
accused
of
occasionally
firing
on
flags
of
truce
they
were
sent
perhaps
so
as
to
be
of
service
in
the
event
of
any
mishap
occurring
all
being
ready
we
crossed
the
massive
drawbridge
of
the
porte
de
charenton
and
wound
in
and
out
of
the
covered
way
which
an
advanced
redoubt
protected
a
small
detachment
of
light
cavalry
then
joined
us
and
we
speedily
crossed
the
devastated
track
known
as
the
military
zone
where
every
tree
had
been
felled
at
the
moment
of
the
investment
immediately
afterwards
we
found
ourselves
in
the
narrow
winding
streets
of
charenton
which
had
been
almost
entirely
deserted
by
their
inhabitants
but
were
crowded
with
soldiers
who
stood
at
doors
and
windows
watching
our
curious
caravan
the
bridge
across
the
marne
was
mined
but
still
intact
and
defended
at
the
farther
end
by
an
entrenched
and
loopholed
redoubt
faced
by
some
very
intricate
and
artistic
once
across
the
river
we
wound
round
to
the
left
through
the
village
of
alfort
where
all
the
villas
and
restaurants
had
been
turned
into
military
posts
and
on
looking
back
we
saw
the
huge
charenton
madhouse
surmounting
a
wooded
height
and
flying
a
large
black
flag
at
the
outset
of
the
siege
it
had
been
suggested
that
the
more
harmless
inmates
should
be
released
rather
than
remain
exposed
to
harm
from
chance
german
shells
but
the
director
of
the
establishment
declared
that
in
many
instances
insanity
intensified
patriotic
feeling
and
that
if
his
patients
were
set
at
liberty
they
would
at
least
desire
to
become
members
of
the
government
so
they
were
suffered
to
remain
in
their
exposed
position
we
went
on
skirting
the
estate
of
charentonneau
where
the
park
wall
had
been
blown
down
and
many
of
the
trees
felled
on
our
right
was
the
fort
of
charenton
armed
with
big
black
naval
guns
all
the
garden
walls
on
our
line
of
route
had
been
razed
or
loopholed
the
road
was
at
times
barricaded
with
trees
or
intersected
by
trenches
and
it
was
not
without
difficulty
that
we
surmounted
those
impediments
at
petit
créteil
we
were
astonished
to
see
a
number
of
working
as
unconcernedly
as
in
times
of
peace
it
is
true
that
the
village
was
covered
by
the
fire
of
the
charenton
fort
and
that
the
germans
would
have
incurred
great
risk
in
making
a
serious
attack
on
it
nevertheless
small
parties
of
them
occasionally
crept
down
and
exchanged
shots
with
the
mobiles
who
were
stationed
there
having
their
headquarters
at
a
deserted
inn
on
reaching
which
we
made
our
first
halt
the
hired
vehicles
were
now
sent
back
to
paris
and
after
a
brief
interval
we
went
on
again
passing
through
an
aperture
in
a
barricade
we
then
readied
créteil
proper
and
there
the
first
serious
traces
of
the
havoc
of
war
were
offered
to
our
view
the
once
pleasant
village
was
lifeless
every
house
had
been
broken
into
and
plundered
every
door
and
every
window
smashed
smaller
articles
of
furniture
and
so
forth
had
been
removed
larger
ones
reduced
to
fragments
an
infernal
spirit
of
destruction
had
swept
through
the
place
and
yet
mark
this
we
were
still
within
the
french
lines
our
progress
along
the
main
street
being
suddenly
checked
by
another
huge
barricade
we
wound
round
to
the
right
and
at
last
reached
a
house
where
less
than
a
score
of
mobiles
were
gathered
protected
from
sudden
assault
by
a
flimsy
barrier
of
planks
casks
stools
and
broken
chairs
this
was
the
most
advanced
french
outpost
in
the
direction
we
were
following
we
passed
it
crossing
some
open
fields
where
a
solitary
man
was
calmly
digging
potatoes
risking
his
life
at
every
turn
of
his
spade
but
knowing
that
every
pound
of
the
precious
tuber
that
he
might
succeed
in
taking
into
paris
would
there
fetch
perhaps
as
much
as
ten
francs
again
we
halted
and
the
trumpeter
and
the
trooper
with
the
white
flag
rode
on
to
the
farther
part
of
the
somewhat
scattered
village
suddenly
the
trumpet
call
rang
out
through
the
sharp
frosty
air
and
then
we
again
moved
on
passing
down
another
village
street
where
several
gaunt
starving
cats
attempted
to
follow
us
with
desperate
strides
and
piteous
mews
before
long
we
perceived
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
before
us
a
couple
of
german
soldiers
in
long
and
boots
reaching
to
the
shins
one
of
them
was
carrying
a
white
flag
a
brief
conversation
ensued
with
them
for
they
both
spoke
french
and
one
of
them
knew
english
also
soon
afterwards
from
behind
a
stout
barricade
which
we
saw
ahead
three
or
four
of
their
officers
arrived
and
somewhat
stiff
and
ceremonious
salutes
were
exchanged
between
them
and
the
french
officers
in
charge
of
our
party
our
arrival
had
probably
been
anticipated
at
all
events
a
big
and
very
welcome
fire
of
logs
and
branches
was
blazing
near
by
and
whilst
one
or
two
officers
on
either
side
together
with
colonel
claremont
and
some
officials
of
the
british
charitable
fund
were
attending
to
the
of
her
then
majesty
subjects
the
other
french
and
german
officers
engaged
in
conversation
round
the
fire
i
have
mentioned
the
latter
were
probably
saxons
at
all
events
they
belonged
to
the
forces
of
the
crown
prince
afterwards
king
of
saxony
who
commanded
this
part
of
the
investing
lines
and
with
whom
the
principal
english
was
archibald
forbes
freshly
arrived
from
the
siege
of
metz
the
recent
fall
of
that
stronghold
and
the
conduct
of
marshal
bazaine
supplied
the
chief
subject
of
the
conversation
carried
on
at
the
créteil
outposts
between
the
officers
of
the
contending
nations
now
and
then
too
came
a
reference
to
sedan
and
the
overthrow
of
the
bonapartist
empire
the
entire
conversation
was
in
french
i
doubt
indeed
if
our
french
custodians
could
speak
german
and
the
greatest
courtesy
prevailed
though
the
french
steadily
declined
the
hamburg
cigars
which
their
adversaries
offered
them
i
listened
awhile
to
the
conversation
but
when
the
for
my
father
and
myself
had
been
examined
i
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
in
order
to
scan
the
expanse
of
fields
lying
in
that
direction
all
at
once
i
saw
a
german
officer
mounted
on
a
horse
galloping
over
the
rough
ground
in
our
direction
he
came
straight
towards
me
he
was
a
man
of
some
rank
possibly
a
colonel
reining
in
his
mount
he
addressed
me
in
french
asking
several
questions
when
however
i
had
told
him
who
we
were
he
continued
the
conversation
in
english
and
inquired
if
i
had
brought
any
newspapers
out
of
paris
now
we
were
all
pledged
not
to
give
any
information
of
value
to
the
enemy
but
i
had
in
my
pockets
copies
of
two
of
the
most
violent
prints
then
appearing
in
the
city
that
is
to
say
patrie
en
inspired
by
blanqui
and
edited
by
felix
pyat
the
was
all
sound
and
fury
and
the
second
contained
a
subscription
list
for
a
pecuniary
reward
and
rifle
of
honour
to
be
presented
to
the
frenchman
who
might
fortunately
succeed
in
killing
the
king
of
prussia
as
the
german
officer
was
so
anxious
to
ascertain
what
the
popular
feeling
in
paris
might
be
and
whether
it
favoured
further
resistance
it
occurred
to
me
in
a
spirit
of
devilment
as
it
were
to
present
him
with
the
aforesaid
journals
for
which
he
expressed
his
heartfelt
thanks
and
then
galloped
away
as
i
never
met
him
again
i
can
not
say
how
he
took
the
invectives
and
the
perhaps
it
was
not
quite
right
of
me
to
foist
on
him
as
examples
of
genuine
parisian
opinion
two
such
papers
as
those
i
gave
him
but
then
all
is
fair
not
merely
in
love
but
in
war
also
and
in
regard
to
the
contentions
of
france
and
germany
my
sympathies
were
entirely
on
the
side
of
france
we
had
not
yet
been
transferred
to
the
german
escort
which
was
waiting
for
us
when
all
at
once
we
heard
several
shots
fired
from
the
bank
of
the
marne
whereupon
a
couple
of
german
dragoons
galloped
off
in
that
direction
the
firing
ceased
as
abruptly
as
it
had
begun
and
then
everything
being
in
readiness
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
colonel
claremont
the
charitable
fund
people
the
french
officers
and
cavalry
and
the
ambulance
waggons
retraced
their
way
to
paris
whilst
our
caravan
went
on
in
the
charge
of
a
detachment
of
german
dragoons
not
for
long
however
for
the
instructions
received
respecting
us
were
evidently
imperfect
the
reader
will
have
noticed
that
we
left
paris
on
its
southeastern
side
although
our
destination
was
versailles
which
lies
of
the
capital
being
in
that
direction
only
some
eleven
miles
distant
further
on
quitting
créteil
instead
of
taking
a
direct
route
to
the
city
of
louis
quatorze
we
made
as
the
reader
will
presently
see
an
immense
so
that
our
journey
to
versailles
lasted
three
full
days
this
occurred
because
the
germans
wished
to
prevent
us
from
seeing
anything
of
the
nearer
lines
of
investment
and
the
preparations
which
had
already
begun
for
the
bombardment
of
paris
on
our
departure
from
créteil
however
our
route
was
not
yet
positively
fixed
so
we
presently
halted
and
an
officer
of
our
escort
rode
off
to
take
further
instructions
whilst
we
remained
near
a
german
outpost
where
we
could
not
help
noticing
how
stalwart
and
the
men
were
orders
respecting
our
movements
having
arrived
we
set
out
again
at
a
walking
pace
perhaps
because
so
many
of
our
party
were
on
foot
troops
were
posted
near
every
that
we
passed
officers
constantly
cantered
up
inquiring
for
news
respecting
the
position
of
affairs
in
paris
wishing
to
know
in
particular
if
the
national
defence
ministers
were
still
prisoners
of
the
populace
and
whether
there
was
now
a
red
republic
with
blanqui
at
its
head
what
astounded
them
most
was
to
hear
that
although
paris
was
taking
more
and
more
to
horseflesh
it
was
as
yet
by
no
means
starving
and
that
so
far
as
famine
might
be
concerned
it
would
be
able
to
continue
resisting
for
some
months
longer
in
point
of
fact
this
was
on
november
and
the
city
did
not
surrender
until
january
but
the
german
officers
would
not
believe
what
we
said
respecting
the
resources
of
the
besieged
they
repeated
the
same
questions
again
and
again
and
still
looked
incredulous
as
if
indeed
they
thought
that
we
were
fooling
them
at
léger
we
halted
whilst
the
british
austrian
and
swiss
representatives
interviewed
the
general
in
command
there
he
was
installed
in
a
trim
little
château
in
front
of
which
was
the
quaintest
i
have
ever
seen
for
it
was
fashioned
of
planks
logs
and
all
sorts
of
scraps
of
furniture
whilst
beside
it
lay
a
doll
perambulator
and
a
little
boy
but
we
again
set
out
encountering
near
a
long
line
of
german
and
presently
without
addressing
a
word
to
any
of
us
the
officer
of
our
escort
gave
a
command
his
troopers
wheeled
round
and
galloped
away
leaving
us
to
ourselves
by
this
time
evening
was
approaching
and
the
vehicles
of
our
party
drove
on
at
a
smart
trot
leaving
the
unfortunate
pedestrians
a
long
way
in
the
rear
nobody
seemed
to
know
exactly
where
we
were
but
some
passing
peasants
informed
us
that
we
were
on
the
road
to
basle
and
that
the
nearest
locality
was
the
horses
drawing
the
conveyances
of
the
swiss
and
austrian
representatives
were
superior
to
those
harnessed
to
wodehouse
break
so
we
were
distanced
on
the
road
and
on
reaching
brie
found
that
all
the
accommodation
of
the
two
inns
i
can
scarcely
call
them
hotels
had
been
allotted
to
the
first
arrivals
wodehouse
party
secured
a
lodging
in
a
private
house
whilst
my
father
myself
and
about
thirty
others
repaired
to
the
for
billets
a
striking
scene
met
my
eyes
there
by
this
time
night
had
fallen
in
a
room
which
was
almost
bare
of
furniture
the
mayor
was
seated
at
a
little
table
on
which
two
candles
were
burning
on
either
side
of
him
stood
a
german
infantryman
with
rifle
and
fixed
bayonet
here
and
there
too
were
several
german
hussars
together
with
ten
or
a
dozen
peasants
of
the
locality
and
the
unfortunate
mayor
in
a
state
of
was
striving
to
comply
with
the
enemy
requisitions
of
food
forage
wine
horses
and
vehicles
the
peasants
meanwhile
protesting
that
they
had
already
been
despoiled
of
everything
and
had
nothing
whatever
left
so
you
want
me
to
be
shot
said
the
mayor
to
them
at
last
you
know
very
well
that
the
things
must
be
found
go
and
get
them
together
do
the
best
you
can
we
will
see
afterwards
when
acting
as
usual
as
my
father
interpreter
i
asked
the
mayor
for
billets
he
raised
his
arms
to
the
ceiling
i
have
no
beds
said
he
every
bit
of
available
bedding
excepting
at
the
inns
has
been
requisitioned
for
the
prussian
ambulances
i
might
find
some
straw
and
there
are
outhouses
and
empty
rooms
but
there
are
so
many
of
you
and
i
do
not
know
how
i
can
accommodate
you
all
it
was
not
however
the
duty
of
my
father
or
myself
to
attend
to
the
requirements
of
the
whole
party
that
was
the
duty
rather
of
the
embassy
officials
so
i
again
pressed
the
mayor
to
give
me
at
least
a
couple
of
decent
billets
he
thought
for
a
moment
then
handed
me
a
paper
bearing
a
name
and
address
whereupon
we
my
father
and
myself
went
off
but
it
was
and
as
we
could
not
find
the
place
indicated
we
returned
to
the
where
after
no
little
trouble
a
second
paper
was
given
me
by
this
time
the
poorer
members
of
the
party
had
been
sent
to
sheds
and
so
forth
where
they
found
some
straw
to
lie
upon
the
address
on
my
second
paper
was
that
of
a
whose
house
was
pointed
out
to
us
we
were
very
cordially
received
there
and
taken
to
a
room
containing
a
bed
provided
with
a
but
there
was
no
mattress
no
sheet
no
blanket
no
bolster
no
pillow
everything
of
that
kind
having
been
requisitioned
for
the
german
ambulances
and
i
recollect
that
two
or
three
hours
later
when
my
father
and
myself
retired
to
rest
in
that
icy
chamber
the
window
of
which
was
badly
broken
we
were
glad
to
lay
our
heads
on
a
couple
of
hard
baskets
having
left
our
bags
in
charge
before
trying
to
sleep
however
we
required
food
for
during
the
day
we
had
consumed
every
particle
of
a
cold
rabbit
and
some
which
we
had
brought
out
of
paris
the
innkeepers
proved
to
be
extremely
independent
and
irritable
and
we
could
obtain
very
little
from
them
fortunately
we
discovered
a
butcher
secured
some
meat
from
him
and
prevailed
on
the
wife
of
our
host
the
to
cook
it
for
us
we
then
went
out
again
and
found
some
cafés
and
which
were
crowded
with
german
soldiery
wine
and
black
coffee
were
obtainable
there
and
whilst
we
refreshed
ourselves
more
than
one
german
soldier
knowing
either
french
or
english
engaged
us
in
conversation
my
own
german
was
at
that
time
very
limited
for
i
had
not
taken
kindly
to
the
study
of
the
language
and
had
secured
moreover
but
few
opportunities
to
attempt
to
converse
in
it
however
i
well
remember
some
of
the
german
soldiers
declaring
that
they
were
heartily
sick
of
the
siege
and
expressing
a
hope
that
the
parisians
would
speedily
surrender
so
that
they
the
germans
might
return
to
the
fatherland
in
ample
time
to
get
their
christmas
trees
ready
a
and
apparently
very
genial
uhlan
also
talked
to
me
about
the
parisian
balloons
relating
that
directly
any
ascent
was
observed
news
of
it
was
telegraphed
along
all
the
investing
lines
that
every
man
had
orders
to
fire
if
the
aerial
craft
came
approximately
within
range
and
that
he
and
his
comrades
often
tried
to
ride
a
balloon
down
after
a
wretched
night
we
washed
at
the
pump
in
the
yard
and
breakfasted
off
bread
and
milk
by
the
way
was
as
scarce
at
brie
as
in
paris
itself
the
germans
it
was
said
having
carried
off
all
the
cows
that
had
previously
supplied
france
with
the
brie
cheese
we
now
discovered
that
in
order
to
reach
versailles
we
should
have
to
proceed
in
the
first
instance
to
corbeil
some
fifteen
miles
distant
when
we
should
be
within
thirty
miles
of
the
german
headquarters
that
was
pleasant
news
indeed
we
had
already
made
a
journey
of
over
twenty
miles
and
now
another
of
some
miles
lay
before
us
and
yet
had
we
only
been
allowed
to
take
the
proper
route
we
should
have
reached
versailles
after
travelling
merely
eleven
miles
beyond
paris
under
the
circumstances
the
position
of
the
unfortunate
pedestrians
was
a
very
unpleasant
one
and
my
father
undertook
to
speak
on
their
behalf
to
wodehouse
pointing
out
to
him
that
it
was
unfair
to
let
these
unfortunate
people
trudge
all
the
way
to
versailles
but
what
am
i
to
do
wodehouse
replied
i
am
afraid
that
no
vehicles
can
be
obtained
here
the
german
authorities
will
perhaps
help
you
in
the
matter
urged
my
father
i
doubt
it
but
please
remember
that
everybody
was
warned
before
leaving
paris
that
he
would
do
so
at
his
own
risk
and
peril
and
that
the
embassy
could
not
charge
itself
with
the
expense
that
is
exactly
what
surprised
me
said
my
father
i
know
that
the
charitable
fund
has
done
something
but
i
thought
that
the
embassy
would
have
done
more
i
had
no
instructions
replied
wodehouse
but
surely
at
such
a
time
as
this
a
man
initiates
his
own
instructions
perhaps
so
but
i
had
no
money
on
hearing
this
my
father
for
a
moment
almost
lost
his
temper
surely
wodehouse
said
he
you
need
only
have
gone
to
baron
de
rothschild
he
would
have
let
you
have
whatever
money
you
required
i
have
reconstructed
the
above
dialogue
from
my
diary
which
i
posted
up
on
reaching
versailles
wodehouse
looked
worried
he
was
certainly
a
most
amiable
man
but
he
was
not
i
think
quite
the
man
for
the
situation
moreover
like
my
father
he
was
in
very
poor
health
at
this
time
still
he
realized
that
he
must
try
to
effect
something
and
eventually
with
the
assistance
of
the
mayor
and
the
german
authorities
a
few
were
procured
for
the
accommodation
of
the
poorer
british
subjects
during
the
long
interval
which
had
elapsed
however
a
good
many
men
had
gone
off
of
their
own
accord
tired
of
waiting
and
resolving
to
try
their
luck
in
one
and
another
direction
thus
our
procession
was
a
somewhat
smaller
one
when
we
at
last
quitted
for
corbeil
we
met
many
german
soldiers
on
our
way
at
times
large
detachments
of
them
and
we
scarcely
ever
covered
a
mile
of
ground
without
being
questioned
respecting
the
state
of
affairs
in
paris
and
the
probable
duration
of
its
resistance
our
replies
invariably
disappointing
the
questioners
so
anxious
were
they
to
see
the
war
come
to
an
end
this
was
particularly
the
case
with
a
young
officer
who
jumped
on
the
step
of
wodehouse
break
and
engaged
us
in
conversation
whilst
we
continued
on
our
way
before
leaving
us
he
remarked
i
remember
that
he
would
very
much
like
to
pay
a
visit
to
england
whereupon
my
father
answered
that
he
would
be
very
much
pleased
to
see
him
there
provided
however
that
he
would
come
by
himself
and
not
with
half
a
million
of
armed
comrades
while
the
german
soldiers
were
numerous
the
peasants
whom
we
met
on
the
road
were
few
and
far
between
on
reaching
the
little
village
of
lieusaint
however
a
number
of
people
rushed
to
the
doors
of
their
houses
and
gazed
at
us
in
bewilderment
for
during
the
past
two
months
the
only
strangers
they
had
seen
had
been
german
soldiers
and
they
could
not
understand
the
meaning
of
our
civilian
caravan
of
carriages
and
carts
at
last
we
entered
corbeil
and
followed
the
main
street
towards
the
old
stone
bridge
by
which
we
hoped
to
cross
the
seine
but
we
speedily
discovered
that
it
had
been
blown
up
and
that
we
could
only
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
by
a
lower
down
this
having
been
effected
we
drove
to
the
principal
hotel
intending
to
put
up
there
for
the
night
as
it
had
become
evident
that
we
should
be
unable
to
reach
versailles
at
a
reasonable
hour
however
the
entire
hotel
was
in
the
possession
of
german
officers
several
of
whom
we
found
flirting
with
the
landlady
daughter
who
as
she
wore
a
wedding
ring
was
i
presume
married
i
well
recollect
that
she
made
some
reference
to
the
ladies
of
berlin
whereupon
one
of
the
lieutenants
who
were
ogling
her
gallantly
replied
that
they
were
not
half
so
charming
as
the
ladies
of
corbeil
the
young
woman
appeared
to
appreciate
the
compliment
for
on
the
lieutenant
rising
to
take
leave
of
her
she
graciously
gave
him
her
hand
and
said
to
him
with
a
smile
au
plaisir
de
vous
revoir
monsieur
but
matters
were
very
different
with
the
old
lady
her
mother
who
directly
the
coast
was
clear
began
to
inveigh
against
the
germans
in
good
set
terms
describing
them
i
remember
as
who
destroyed
whatever
they
did
not
steal
she
was
particularly
irate
with
them
for
not
allowing
darblay
the
wealthy
magnate
of
the
grain
and
flour
trade
and
at
the
same
time
mayor
of
corbeil
to
retain
a
single
carriage
or
a
single
horse
for
his
own
use
yet
he
had
already
surrendered
four
carriages
and
eight
horses
to
them
and
only
wished
to
keep
a
little
gig
and
a
cob
we
obtained
a
meal
at
the
hotel
but
found
it
impossible
to
secure
a
bed
there
so
we
sallied
forth
into
the
town
on
an
exploring
expedition
on
all
sides
we
observed
notices
indicating
the
rate
of
exchange
of
french
and
german
money
and
the
place
seemed
to
be
full
of
tobacconists
shops
which
were
invariably
occupied
by
german
jews
trading
in
hamburg
cigars
on
inquiring
at
a
café
respecting
accommodation
we
were
told
that
we
should
only
obtain
it
with
difficulty
as
the
town
was
full
of
troops
including
more
than
a
thousand
sick
and
wounded
fifteen
or
twenty
of
whom
died
every
day
at
last
we
crossed
the
river
again
and
found
quarters
at
an
inferior
hotel
the
of
which
had
been
badly
damaged
by
some
falling
blocks
of
stone
at
the
time
when
the
french
blew
up
the
town
bridge
however
our
beds
were
fairly
comfortable
and
we
had
a
good
night
rest
black
coffee
was
again
the
only
available
beverage
in
the
morning
no
milk
was
to
be
had
nor
was
there
even
a
scrap
of
sugar
in
these
respects
corbeil
was
even
worse
off
than
paris
the
weather
had
now
changed
and
rain
was
falling
steadily
we
plainly
had
a
nasty
day
before
us
nevertheless
another
set
of
carts
was
obtained
for
the
poorer
folk
of
our
party
on
mustering
which
one
man
was
found
to
be
missing
he
had
fallen
ill
we
were
told
and
could
not
continue
the
journey
presently
moreover
the
case
was
discovered
to
be
one
of
smallpox
which
disease
had
lately
broken
out
in
paris
leaving
the
sufferer
to
be
treated
at
the
already
crowded
local
hospital
we
set
out
and
on
emerging
from
the
town
passed
a
drove
of
a
couple
of
hundred
oxen
and
some
three
hundred
sheep
in
the
charge
of
german
soldiers
we
had
scarcely
journeyed
another
mile
when
near
essonnes
noted
for
its
one
of
our
carts
broke
down
which
was
scarcely
surprising
the
country
being
hilly
the
roads
heavy
and
the
horses
spavined
again
the
rain
was
now
pouring
in
torrents
to
the
very
great
discomfort
of
the
occupants
of
the
carts
as
well
as
that
of
wodehouse
party
in
the
break
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
so
on
we
drove
mile
after
mile
until
we
were
at
last
absolutely
soaked
the
rain
had
turned
to
sleet
by
the
time
we
reached
longjumeau
famous
for
its
handsome
and
amorous
postilion
of
the
shops
there
were
closed
and
the
inns
were
crowded
with
german
soldiers
so
we
drove
on
in
the
direction
of
palaiseau
but
we
had
covered
only
about
half
the
distance
when
a
overtook
us
and
we
had
to
seek
shelter
at
champlan
a
german
officer
there
assisted
in
placing
our
vehicles
under
cover
but
the
few
peasants
whom
we
saw
eyeing
us
inquisitively
from
the
doors
of
their
houses
declared
that
the
only
thing
they
could
let
us
have
to
eat
was
dry
bread
there
being
no
meat
no
eggs
no
butter
no
cheese
in
the
whole
village
further
they
averred
that
they
had
not
even
a
pint
of
wine
to
place
at
our
disposal
the
germans
have
taken
everything
they
said
we
have
of
them
in
and
around
the
village
and
there
are
not
more
than
a
dozen
of
us
left
here
all
the
rest
having
fled
to
paris
when
the
siege
began
the
outlook
seemed
bad
but
wodehouse
valet
a
shrewd
and
energetic
man
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
named
frost
said
to
me
i
do
believe
all
this
i
dare
say
that
if
some
money
is
produced
we
shall
be
able
to
get
something
accordingly
we
jointly
tackled
a
fellow
who
if
i
remember
rightly
was
either
the
village
wheelwright
or
blacksmith
and
momentarily
leaving
the
question
of
food
on
one
side
we
asked
him
if
he
had
not
at
least
a
fire
in
his
house
at
which
we
might
warm
ourselves
our
party
included
a
lady
the
wife
and
although
she
was
making
the
journey
in
a
closed
private
omnibus
she
was
suffering
from
the
cold
this
was
explained
to
the
man
whom
we
addressed
and
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
we
were
not
germans
in
disguise
he
told
us
that
we
might
come
into
his
house
and
warm
ourselves
until
the
storm
abated
some
nine
or
ten
of
us
including
the
lady
i
have
mentioned
availed
ourselves
of
this
permission
and
the
man
led
us
upstairs
to
a
room
where
a
big
was
blazing
before
it
sat
his
wife
and
his
daughter
both
of
them
good
specimens
of
french
rustic
beauty
with
great
they
at
once
made
room
for
us
and
added
more
fuel
to
the
fire
half
the
battle
was
won
and
presently
we
were
regaled
with
all
that
they
could
offer
us
in
the
way
of
food
that
is
bread
and
baked
pears
which
proved
very
acceptable
eventually
after
looking
out
of
the
window
in
order
to
make
quite
sure
that
no
germans
were
loitering
near
the
house
our
host
locked
the
door
of
the
room
and
turning
towards
a
big
pile
of
straw
and
household
utensils
proceeded
to
demolish
it
until
he
disclosed
to
view
a
small
cask
a
half
hogshead
i
think
which
said
he
in
a
whisper
contained
wine
it
was
all
that
he
had
been
able
to
secrete
on
the
arrival
of
the
enemy
in
the
district
a
party
of
officers
had
come
to
his
house
and
ordered
their
men
to
remove
the
rest
of
his
wine
together
with
nearly
all
his
bedding
and
every
fowl
and
every
pig
that
he
possessed
they
have
done
the
same
all
over
the
district
the
man
added
and
you
should
see
some
of
the
châteaux
they
have
been
absolutely
stripped
of
their
contents
his
face
brightened
when
we
told
him
that
paris
seemed
resolved
on
no
surrender
and
that
according
to
official
reports
she
would
have
a
sufficiency
of
bread
to
continue
resisting
until
the
ensuing
month
of
february
in
common
with
most
of
his
countrymen
our
host
of
champlan
held
that
whatever
else
might
happen
the
honour
of
the
nation
would
at
least
be
saved
if
the
germans
could
only
be
kept
out
of
paris
and
thus
he
was
right
glad
to
hear
that
the
city
defence
would
be
prolonged
he
was
well
remunerated
for
his
hospitality
and
on
the
weather
slightly
improving
we
resumed
our
journey
to
versailles
following
the
main
road
by
way
of
palaiseau
and
and
urging
the
horses
to
their
quickest
pace
whilst
the
light
declined
and
the
evening
shadows
gathered
around
us

versailles

and

i
resolve
to
go
to
the
front
it
was
dark
when
we
at
last
entered
versailles
by
the
avenue
de
choisy
we
saw
some
sentries
but
they
did
not
challenge
us
and
we
went
on
until
we
struck
the
avenue
de
paris
where
we
passed
the
prefecture
every
one
of
whose
windows
was
a
blaze
of
light
king
later
emperor
william
had
his
quarters
there
bismarck
however
residing
at
a
house
in
the
rue
de
provence
belonging
to
the
french
general
de
jessé
winding
round
the
place
we
noticed
that
one
wing
of
louis
xiv
famous
palace
had
its
windows
lighted
being
appropriated
to
hospital
purposes
and
that
four
batteries
of
artillery
were
drawn
up
on
the
square
perhaps
as
a
hint
to
the
versaillese
to
be
on
their
best
behaviour
however
we
drove
on
and
a
few
moments
later
we
pulled
up
outside
the
famous
hôtel
des
réservoirs
there
was
no
possibility
of
obtaining
accommodation
there
from
its
to
its
garrets
the
hotel
was
packed
with
german
princes
dukes
dukelets
and
their
suites
together
with
a
certain
number
of
english
american
and
other
close
by
however
indeed
if
i
remember
rightly
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
there
was
a
café
whither
my
father
and
myself
directed
our
steps
we
found
it
crowded
with
officers
and
newspaper
men
and
through
one
or
other
of
the
latter
we
succeeded
in
obtaining
comfortable
lodgings
in
a
private
house
the
london
artist
with
the
german
staff
was
landells
son
of
the
engraver
of
that
name
and
we
speedily
discovered
his
whereabouts
he
was
sharing
rooms
with
hilary
skinner
the
representative
at
versailles
and
they
both
gave
us
a
cordial
greeting
the
chief
correspondent
at
the
german
headquarters
was
william
howard
russell
of
the
respecting
whom
perhaps
because
he
kept
himself
somewhat
aloof
from
his
colleagues
a
variety
of
scarcely
stories
were
related
mostly
designed
to
show
that
he
somewhat
his
own
importance
one
yarn
was
to
the
effect
that
whenever
the
doctor
mounted
his
horse
it
was
customary
for
the
crown
prince
of
prussia
afterwards
the
emperor
frederick
to
hold
his
stirrup
leather
for
him
personally
i
can
only
say
that
on
my
father
calling
with
me
on
russell
he
received
us
very
cordially
indeed
he
had
previously
met
my
father
and
had
well
known
my
uncle
frank
and
that
when
we
quitted
versailles
as
i
shall
presently
relate
he
placed
his
courier
and
his
private
omnibus
at
our
disposal
in
after
years
one
of
my
cousins
the
late
montague
vizetelly
accompanied
russell
to
south
america
i
still
have
some
letters
which
the
latter
wrote
me
respecting
zola
novel
la
débâcle
in
which
he
took
a
great
interest
another
at
versailles
was
the
present
earl
of
dunraven
then
not
quite
thirty
years
of
age
and
known
by
the
courtesy
title
of
lord
adare
he
had
previously
acted
as
the
representative
with
napier
expedition
against
theodore
of
abyssinia
and
was
now
staying
at
versailles
on
behalf
i
think
of
the
same
journal
his
rooms
at
the
hôtel
des
réservoirs
were
shared
by
daniel
dunglas
home
the
medium
with
whom
my
father
and
myself
speedily
became
acquainted
very
tall
and
slim
with
blue
eyes
and
an
abundance
of
yellowish
hair
home
at
this
time
about
years
of
age
came
of
the
old
stock
of
the
earls
of
home
whose
name
figures
so
often
in
scottish
history
his
father
was
an
illegitimate
son
of
the
tenth
earl
and
his
mother
belonged
to
a
family
which
claimed
to
possess
the
gift
of
second
sight
home
himself
according
to
his
own
account
began
to
see
visions
and
receive
mysterious
warnings
at
the
period
of
his
mother
death
and
as
time
elapsed
his
many
visitations
from
the
other
world
so
greatly
upset
the
aunt
with
whom
he
was
living
a
mcneill
cook
of
greeneville
connecticut
he
had
been
taken
from
scotland
to
america
when
he
was
about
nine
years
old
that
she
ended
by
turning
him
other
people
however
took
an
unhealthy
delight
in
seeing
their
furniture
move
about
without
human
agency
and
in
receiving
more
or
less
ridiculous
messages
from
and
in
folk
of
this
description
home
found
some
useful
friends
he
came
to
london
in
the
spring
of
and
on
giving
a
at
hotel
in
jermyn
street
he
contrived
to
deceive
sir
david
brewster
then
years
old
but
was
less
successful
with
another
septuagenarian
lord
brougham
later
he
captured
the
imaginative
sir
edward
bulwer
subsequently
lord
lytton
who
as
author
of
zanoni
was
perhaps
fated
to
believe
in
him
and
he
also
impressed
browning
but
not
browning
himself
the
latter
indeed
depicted
home
as
sludge
the
medium
going
to
italy
for
a
time
the
already
notorious
adventurer
gave
in
a
haunted
villa
near
florence
but
on
becoming
converted
to
the
catholic
faith
in
he
was
received
in
private
audience
by
that
handsome
urbane
but
by
no
means
satisfactory
pontiff
pio
nono
who
however
eight
years
later
caused
him
to
be
summarily
expelled
from
rome
as
a
sorcerer
in
league
with
the
devil
meantime
home
had
ingratiated
himself
with
a
number
of
crowned
heads
napoleon
iii
and
the
empress
eugénie
in
whose
presence
he
gave
at
the
tuileries
fontainebleau
and
biarritz
the
king
of
prussia
by
whom
he
was
received
at
and
queen
sophia
of
holland
who
gave
him
hospitality
at
the
hague
on
marrying
a
russian
lady
the
daughter
of
general
count
de
kroll
he
was
favoured
with
presents
by
the
czar
alexander
ii
and
after
returning
to
england
became
one
of
the
attractions
of
gibson
a
daughter
of
the
rev
sir
thomas
gery
cullum
being
one
of
the
early
english
patronesses
of
spiritualism
to
a
faith
in
which
she
was
converted
by
home
whom
she
first
met
whilst
travelling
on
the
continent
i
remember
hearing
no
little
talk
about
him
in
my
younger
days
thackeray
friend
robert
bell
wrote
an
article
about
him
in
which
was
the
subject
of
considerable
discussion
bell
i
think
was
also
mixed
up
in
the
affair
of
the
davenport
brothers
one
of
whose
performances
i
remember
witnessing
they
were
afterwards
effectively
shown
up
in
paris
by
vicomte
alfred
de
caston
home
for
his
part
was
scarcely
taken
seriously
by
the
parisians
and
when
at
a
given
in
presence
of
the
empress
eugénie
he
blundered
grossly
and
repeatedly
about
her
father
the
count
of
montijo
he
received
an
intimation
that
his
presence
at
court
could
be
dispensed
with
he
then
consoled
himself
by
going
to
peterhof
and
exhibiting
his
powers
to
the
czar
certain
scotch
and
english
scientists
such
as
lockhart
robertson
robert
chambers
and
james
manby
gully
the
apostle
of
hydropathy
who
came
to
grief
in
the
notorious
bravo
case
warmly
supported
home
so
did
samuel
carter
hall
and
his
wife
william
howitt
and
gerald
massey
and
he
ended
by
establishing
a
spiritual
athenaeum
in
sloane
street
a
wealthy
widow
of
advanced
years
a
jane
lyon
became
a
subscriber
to
that
institution
and
growing
infatuated
with
home
made
him
a
present
of
some
and
settled
on
him
a
similar
amount
to
be
paid
at
her
death
but
after
a
year
or
two
she
repented
of
her
infatuation
and
took
legal
proceedings
to
recover
her
money
she
failed
to
substantiate
some
of
her
charges
but
giffard
who
heard
the
case
decided
it
in
her
favour
in
his
judgment
describing
home
as
a
needy
and
designing
man
home
i
should
add
was
at
this
time
a
widower
and
at
loggerheads
with
his
late
wife
relations
in
russia
in
respect
to
her
property
among
the
arts
ascribed
to
home
was
that
called
levitation
in
practising
which
he
was
raised
in
the
air
by
an
unseen
and
unknown
force
and
remained
suspended
there
this
being
so
to
say
the
first
step
towards
human
flying
without
the
assistance
of
any
biplane
monoplane
or
other
mechanical
contrivance
the
first
occasion
on
which
home
is
said
to
have
displayed
this
power
was
in
the
late
fifties
when
he
was
at
a
château
near
bordeaux
as
the
guest
of
the
widow
of
théodore
ducos
the
nephew
of
bonaparte
colleague
in
the
consulate
in
the
works
put
forward
on
behalf
one
of
them
called
incidents
in
my
life
was
chiefly
written
it
appears
by
his
friend
and
solicitor
a
wilkinson
it
is
also
asserted
that
his
power
of
levitation
was
attested
in
later
years
by
lord
lindsay
subsequently
earl
of
crawford
and
balcarres
and
by
the
present
earl
of
dunraven
we
are
told
indeed
that
on
one
occasion
the
actually
saw
home
float
out
of
a
room
by
one
window
and
into
it
again
by
another
one
i
do
not
know
whether
home
also
favoured
professor
crookes
with
any
exhibition
of
this
kind
but
the
latter
certainly
expressed
an
opinion
that
some
of
home
feats
were
genuine
when
my
father
and
i
first
met
him
at
versailles
he
was
constantly
in
the
company
of
lord
adare
he
claimed
to
be
acting
as
the
correspondent
of
a
californian
journal
but
his
chief
occupation
appeared
to
be
the
giving
of
for
the
entertainment
of
all
the
german
princes
and
princelets
staying
at
the
hôtel
des
réservoirs
most
of
these
highnesses
and
mightinesses
formed
part
of
what
the
germans
themselves
sarcastically
called
their
ornamental
staff
and
as
moltke
seldom
allowed
them
any
real
share
in
the
military
operations
they
doubtless
found
in
performances
some
relief
from
the
which
overtook
them
during
their
long
wait
for
the
capitulation
of
paris
now
that
metz
had
fallen
that
was
the
chief
question
which
occupied
the
minds
of
all
the
germans
assembled
at
versailles
note
and
home
was
called
upon
to
foretell
when
it
would
take
place
on
certain
occasions
i
believe
he
evoked
the
spirits
of
frederick
the
great
napoleon
blücher
and
others
in
order
to
obtain
from
them
an
accurate
forecast
at
another
time
he
endeavoured
to
peer
into
the
future
by
means
of
in
which
he
required
the
help
of
a
little
child
my
experiments
have
not
succeeded
he
said
one
day
while
we
were
sitting
with
him
at
the
café
near
the
hôtel
des
réservoirs
but
that
is
not
my
fault
i
need
an
absolutely
child
and
can
find
none
here
for
this
french
race
is
corrupt
from
its
very
infancy
he
was
fasting
at
this
time
taking
apparently
nothing
but
a
little
for
several
days
at
a
stretch
the
spirits
will
not
move
me
unless
i
do
this
he
said
to
bring
them
to
me
i
have
to
contend
against
the
material
part
of
my
nature
note
the
germans
regarded
it
as
the
more
urgent
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
at
versailles
as
only
a
few
data
previously
november
the
new
french
army
of
the
loire
under
de
paladines
had
defeated
the
bavarians
at
coulmiers
and
thereby
again
secured
possession
of
orleans
a
couple
of
years
later
after
another
visit
to
petersburg
where
it
seems
he
was
again
well
received
by
the
czar
and
again
married
a
lady
of
the
russian
nobility
home
health
began
to
fail
him
perhaps
on
account
of
the
to
which
at
intervals
he
subjected
himself
i
saw
him
occasionally
during
his
last
years
when
living
at
auteuil
he
was
almost
a
neighbour
of
mine
he
died
there
in
being
then
about
years
old
personally
i
never
placed
faith
in
him
i
regarded
him
at
the
outset
with
great
curiosity
but
some
time
before
the
war
i
had
read
a
good
deal
about
cagliostro
saint
germain
mesmer
and
other
charlatans
also
attending
a
lecture
about
them
at
the
salle
des
conferences
and
all
that
combined
with
the
exposure
of
the
davenport
brothers
and
other
spiritualists
and
illusionists
helped
to
prejudice
me
against
such
a
man
as
home
at
the
same
time
this
wizard
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
certainly
a
curious
personality
possessed
i
presume
of
considerable
suggestive
powers
which
at
times
enabled
him
to
make
others
believe
as
he
desired
we
ought
to
have
had
charcot
opinion
of
his
case
as
it
had
taken
my
father
and
myself
three
days
to
reach
versailles
from
paris
and
we
could
not
tell
what
other
unpleasant
experiences
the
future
might
hold
in
store
for
us
our
pecuniary
position
gave
rise
to
some
concern
i
mentioned
previously
that
we
quitted
the
capital
with
comparatively
little
money
and
it
now
seemed
as
if
our
journey
might
become
a
long
and
somewhat
costly
affair
particularly
as
the
german
staff
wished
to
send
us
off
through
northern
france
and
thence
by
way
of
belgium
on
consulting
landells
skinner
and
some
other
correspondents
it
appeared
that
several
days
might
elapse
before
we
could
obtain
remittances
from
england
on
the
other
hand
every
correspondent
clung
to
such
money
as
he
had
in
his
possession
for
living
was
very
expensive
at
versailles
and
at
any
moment
some
emergency
might
arise
necessitating
an
unexpected
outlay
it
was
suggested
however
that
we
should
apply
to
colonel
beauchamp
walker
who
was
the
official
british
representative
with
the
german
headquarters
staff
for
we
were
told
parliament
in
its
generosity
had
voted
a
sum
of
to
assist
any
needy
british
subjects
who
might
come
out
of
paris
and
colonel
walker
had
the
handling
of
the
money
in
question
naturally
enough
my
father
began
by
demurring
to
this
suggestion
saying
that
he
could
not
apply
formâ
for
charity
but
it
was
pointed
out
that
he
need
do
no
such
thing
go
to
walker
it
was
said
explain
your
difficulty
and
offer
him
a
note
of
hand
or
a
draft
on
the
and
if
desired
half
a
dozen
of
us
will
back
it
some
such
plan
having
been
decided
on
we
called
upon
colonel
walker
on
the
second
or
third
day
of
our
stay
at
versailles
his
full
name
was
charles
pyndar
beauchamp
walker
born
in
he
had
seen
no
little
service
he
had
acted
as
an
to
lord
lucan
in
the
crimea
afterwards
becoming
of
the
dragoon
guards
he
was
in
india
during
the
final
operations
for
the
suppression
of
the
mutiny
and
subsequently
in
china
during
the
expedition
to
that
country
during
the
war
of
he
was
attached
as
british
commissioner
to
the
forces
of
the
crown
prince
of
prussia
and
witnessed
the
battle
of
königgratz
he
served
in
the
same
capacity
during
the
war
when
he
was
at
weissenburg
wörth
and
sedan
in
later
years
he
became
a
a
a
and
colonel
of
the
dragoon
guards
and
from
until
his
retirement
in
he
acted
as
inspector
general
of
military
education
i
have
set
out
those
facts
because
i
have
no
desire
to
minimise
walker
services
and
abilities
but
i
can
not
help
smiling
at
a
sentence
which
i
found
in
the
account
of
him
given
in
the
dictionary
of
national
biography
it
refers
to
his
duties
during
the
war
and
runs
as
follows
the
irritation
of
the
germans
against
england
and
the
number
of
roving
englishmen
made
his
duty
not
an
easy
one
but
he
was
well
qualified
for
it
by
his
tact
and
geniality
and
his
action
met
with
the
full
approval
of
the
government
the
government
in
question
would
have
approved
anything
but
let
that
pass
we
called
on
the
colonel
at
about
eleven
in
the
morning
and
were
shown
into
a
large
and
comfortably
furnished
room
where
decanters
and
cigars
were
prominently
displayed
on
a
central
table
in
ten
minutes
time
the
colonel
appeared
arrayed
in
a
beautiful
figured
with
a
tasselled
girdle
i
knew
that
the
british
officer
was
fond
of
discarding
his
uniform
and
i
was
well
aware
that
french
officers
also
did
so
when
on
furlough
in
paris
but
it
gave
my
young
mind
quite
a
shock
to
see
her
majesty
military
representative
with
king
william
arrayed
in
a
gaudy
in
the
middle
of
the
day
he
seated
himself
and
querulously
inquired
of
my
father
what
his
business
was
it
was
told
him
very
briefly
he
frowned
hummed
hawed
threw
himself
back
in
his
armchair
and
curtly
exclaimed
i
am
not
a
the
fact
that
the
london
was
the
world
premier
journal
of
its
class
went
for
nothing
the
offers
of
the
other
correspondents
of
the
english
press
to
back
my
father
signature
were
dismissed
with
disdain
when
the
colonel
was
reminded
that
he
held
a
considerable
amount
of
money
voted
by
parliament
he
retorted
that
is
for
necessitous
persons
but
you
ask
me
to
you
money
quite
so
my
father
replied
i
do
not
wish
to
be
a
charge
on
the
treasury
i
simply
want
a
loan
as
i
have
a
difficult
and
perhaps
an
expensive
journey
before
me
how
much
do
you
want
snapped
the
colonel
well
said
my
father
i
should
feel
more
comfortable
if
i
had
a
thousand
francs
in
my
pocket
forty
pounds
cried
colonel
walker
as
if
lost
in
amazement
and
getting
up
from
his
chair
he
went
on
in
the
most
theatrical
manner
possible
why
do
you
know
sir
that
if
i
were
to
let
you
have
forty
pounds
i
might
find
myself
in
the
greatest
possible
difficulty
perhaps
even
there
might
be
hundreds
of
our
suffering
outside
the
gates
of
versailles
and
i
unable
to
relieve
them
but
said
my
father
quietly
you
would
still
be
holding
colonel
walker
the
colonel
glared
and
my
father
not
caring
to
prolong
such
an
interview
walked
out
of
the
room
followed
by
myself
a
good
many
of
the
poorer
people
who
quitted
paris
with
us
never
repaired
to
versailles
at
all
but
left
us
at
corbeil
or
elsewhere
to
make
their
way
across
france
as
best
they
could
another
party
about
one
hundred
strong
was
however
subsequently
sent
out
of
the
capital
with
the
assistance
of
washburne
and
in
their
case
colonel
walker
had
to
expend
some
money
but
every
grant
was
a
very
niggardly
one
and
it
would
not
surprise
me
to
learn
that
the
bulk
of
the
money
voted
by
parliament
was
ultimately
returned
to
the
treasury
which
circumstance
would
probably
account
for
the
full
approval
which
the
government
bestowed
on
the
colonel
conduct
at
this
period
he
died
early
in
and
soon
afterwards
some
of
his
correspondence
was
published
in
a
volume
entitled
days
of
a
soldier
life
on
reading
a
review
of
that
work
in
one
of
the
leading
literary
journals
i
was
struck
by
a
passage
in
which
walker
was
described
as
a
disappointed
and
embittered
man
who
always
felt
that
his
merits
were
not
sufficiently
recognized
although
he
was
given
a
knighthood
and
retired
with
the
honorary
rank
of
general
i
presume
that
his
ambition
was
at
least
a
viscounty
if
not
an
earldom
and
a
on
leaving
the
gentleman
whose
tact
and
geniality
are
commemorated
in
the
dictionary
of
national
biography
we
repaired
my
father
and
i
to
the
café
where
most
of
the
english
newspaper
men
met
several
were
there
and
my
father
was
at
once
assailed
with
inquiries
respecting
his
interview
with
colonel
walker
his
account
of
it
led
to
some
laughter
and
a
variety
of
comments
which
would
scarcely
have
improved
the
colonel
temper
i
remember
however
that
captain
afterwards
colonel
sir
henry
hozier
the
author
of
the
seven
weeks
war
smiled
quietly
but
otherwise
kept
his
own
counsel
at
last
my
father
was
asked
what
he
intended
to
do
under
the
circumstances
and
he
replied
that
he
meant
to
communicate
with
england
as
speedily
as
possible
and
remain
in
the
interval
at
versailles
although
he
particularly
wished
to
get
away
now
it
happened
that
among
the
customers
at
the
café
there
were
two
american
officers
one
being
duff
a
brother
of
andrew
halliday
the
dramatic
author
and
essayist
whose
real
patronymic
was
also
duff
my
father
knew
halliday
through
their
mutual
friends
henry
mayhew
and
the
broughs
the
other
american
officer
was
william
babcook
hazen
whose
name
will
be
found
occasionally
mentioned
in
that
popular
record
of
president
garfield
career
from
log
cabin
to
white
house
during
the
civil
war
in
the
united
states
he
had
commanded
a
division
in
sherman
march
to
the
sea
he
also
introduced
the
signal
system
into
the
american
army
and
in
he
was
following
the
operations
of
the
germans
on
behalf
of
his
government
i
do
not
remember
whether
general
duff
who
i
have
been
told
is
still
alive
was
also
at
versailles
in
an
official
capacity
but
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
heard
of
my
father
interview
with
colonel
walker
and
spoke
to
general
hazen
on
the
subject
hazen
did
not
hesitate
but
came
to
my
father
had
a
brief
chat
with
him
unbuttoned
his
uniform
produced
a
case
containing
and
asked
my
father
how
much
he
wanted
telling
him
not
to
pinch
himself
the
whole
transaction
was
completed
in
a
few
minutes
my
father
was
unwilling
to
take
quite
as
much
as
he
had
asked
of
colonel
walker
but
general
hazen
handed
him
some
or
in
notes
one
or
two
of
which
were
afterwards
changed
for
a
handsome
consideration
by
one
of
the
german
jews
who
then
infested
versailles
and
profited
by
the
scarcity
of
gold
we
were
indebted
then
on
two
occasions
to
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
the
enabling
us
to
leave
paris
had
been
supplied
by
washburne
and
the
means
of
continuing
our
journey
in
comfort
were
furnished
by
general
hazen
i
raise
my
hat
to
the
memory
of
both
those
gentlemen
during
the
few
days
that
we
remained
at
versailles
we
caught
glimpses
of
king
william
and
bismarck
both
of
whom
we
had
previously
seen
in
paris
in
when
they
were
the
guests
of
napoleon
iii
i
find
in
my
diary
a
memorandum
dictated
perhaps
by
my
father
bismarck
much
fatter
and
bloated
we
saw
him
one
day
leaving
the
prefecture
where
the
king
had
his
quarters
he
stood
for
a
moment
outside
chatting
and
laughing
noisily
with
some
other
german
personages
then
strode
away
with
a
companion
he
was
only
years
old
and
was
full
of
vigour
at
that
time
even
though
he
might
have
put
on
flesh
during
recent
years
and
therefore
have
renounced
dancing
his
last
partner
in
the
waltz
having
been
mme
carette
the
empress
eugénie
reader
whom
he
led
out
at
one
of
the
balls
at
the
tuileries
very
hale
and
hearty
too
looked
the
king
whom
bismarck
was
about
to
turn
into
an
emperor
yet
the
victor
of
sedan
was
already
years
old
i
only
saw
him
on
horseback
during
my
stay
at
versailles
my
recollections
of
him
bismarck
and
moltke
belong
more
particularly
to
the
year
when
i
was
in
berlin
in
connexion
with
the
famous
meeting
of
the
three
emperors
my
father
and
myself
had
kept
in
touch
with
wodehouse
from
whom
we
learnt
that
we
should
have
to
apply
to
the
german
general
commanding
at
versailles
with
respect
to
any
further
at
first
we
were
informed
that
there
could
be
no
departure
from
the
plan
of
sending
us
out
of
france
by
way
of
epernay
reims
and
sedan
and
this
by
no
means
coincided
with
the
desires
of
most
of
the
englishmen
who
had
come
out
of
paris
they
wishing
to
proceed
westward
and
secure
a
passage
across
the
channel
from
le
hâvre
or
dieppe
my
father
and
myself
also
wanted
to
go
westward
but
in
order
to
make
our
way
into
brittany
my
stepmother
and
her
children
being
at
saint
servan
near
saint
malo
at
last
the
german
authorities
decided
to
give
us
the
alternative
routes
of
mantes
and
dreux
the
being
the
preferable
one
for
those
people
who
were
bound
for
england
it
was
chosen
also
by
my
father
as
the
dreux
route
would
have
led
us
into
a
region
where
hostilities
were
in
progress
and
where
we
might
suddenly
have
found
ourselves
held
up
the
entire
party
of
british
refugees
was
now
limited
to
fifteen
or
sixteen
persons
some
tired
of
waiting
having
taken
themselves
off
by
the
sedan
route
whilst
a
few
others
such
as
coachmen
and
grooms
on
securing
employment
from
german
princes
and
generals
resolved
to
stay
at
versailles
wodehouse
also
remained
there
for
a
short
time
previously
in
poor
health
he
had
further
contracted
a
chill
during
our
three
drive
in
an
open
vehicle
as
most
of
those
who
were
going
on
to
england
at
once
now
found
themselves
almost
insolvent
it
was
arranged
to
pay
their
expenses
through
the
german
lines
and
to
give
each
of
them
a
sum
of
fifty
shillings
so
that
they
might
make
their
way
channelwards
when
they
had
reached
an
uninvaded
part
of
france
colonel
walker
of
course
parted
with
as
little
money
as
possible
at
versailles
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
hire
vehicles
to
take
us
as
far
as
mantes
but
we
were
assured
that
conveyances
might
be
procured
at
saint
and
it
was
thus
that
russell
lent
my
father
his
little
omnibus
for
the
journey
to
the
town
at
the
same
time
sending
his
courier
to
assist
in
making
further
arrangements
i
do
not
recollect
that
courier
nationality
but
he
spoke
english
french
and
german
and
his
services
were
extremely
useful
we
drove
to
saint
germain
by
way
of
rocquencourt
where
we
found
a
number
of
gathered
by
the
roadside
with
little
stalls
at
which
they
sold
wine
and
fruit
to
the
german
soldiers
this
part
of
the
environs
of
paris
seemed
to
have
suffered
less
than
the
eastern
and
southern
districts
so
far
there
had
been
only
one
sortie
on
this
side
that
made
by
ducrot
in
the
direction
of
la
malmaison
it
had
however
momentarily
alarmed
the
investing
forces
and
whilst
we
were
at
versailles
i
learnt
that
on
the
day
in
question
everything
had
been
got
ready
for
king
william
removal
to
saint
germain
in
the
event
of
the
french
achieving
a
real
success
but
it
proved
to
be
a
small
affair
ducrot
force
being
altogether
incommensurate
with
the
effort
required
of
it
at
saint
germain
russell
courier
assisted
in
obtaining
conveyances
for
the
whole
of
our
party
and
we
were
soon
rolling
away
in
the
direction
of
famous
as
the
town
where
william
the
conqueror
whilst
bent
on
pillage
and
destruction
received
the
injuries
which
caused
his
death
here
we
had
to
report
ourselves
to
the
german
commander
who
to
the
general
consternation
began
by
refusing
its
permission
to
proceed
he
did
so
because
most
of
the
delivered
to
us
at
versailles
had
in
the
first
instance
only
stated
that
we
were
to
travel
by
way
of
sedan
the
words
or
mantes
or
dreux
being
afterwards
added
between
the
lines
that
interlineation
was
irregular
said
the
general
at
mantes
it
might
even
be
a
forgery
at
all
events
he
could
not
recognize
it
so
we
must
go
back
whence
we
had
come
and
quickly
too
indeed
he
gave
us
just
half
an
hour
to
quit
the
town
but
it
fortunately
happened
that
in
a
few
of
the
there
was
no
interlineation
whatever
the
words
sedan
or
mantes
or
dreux
being
duly
set
down
in
the
body
of
the
document
and
on
this
being
pointed
out
the
general
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
were
not
trying
to
impose
on
him
he
thereupon
cancelled
his
previous
order
and
decided
that
as
dusk
was
already
falling
we
might
remain
at
mantes
that
night
and
resume
our
journey
on
the
morrow
at
in
the
charge
of
a
cavalry
escort
having
secured
a
couple
of
beds
and
ordered
some
dinner
at
one
of
the
inns
my
father
and
i
strolled
about
the
town
which
was
full
of
uhlans
and
hussars
the
old
stone
bridge
across
the
seine
had
been
blown
up
by
the
french
before
their
evacuation
of
the
town
and
a
part
of
the
railway
line
had
also
been
destroyed
by
them
but
the
germans
were
responsible
for
the
awful
appearance
of
the
never
since
have
i
seen
anything
resembling
it
a
thousand
panes
of
glass
belonging
to
windows
or
roofing
had
been
shivered
to
atoms
every
mirror
in
either
waiting
or
had
been
pounded
to
pieces
every
gilt
frame
broken
into
little
bits
the
clocks
lay
about
in
small
fragments
and
printed
forms
had
been
torn
to
scraps
partitions
chairs
tables
benches
boxes
nests
of
drawers
had
been
hacked
split
broken
reduced
to
mere
strips
of
wood
the
large
stoves
were
overturned
and
broken
and
the
marble
refreshment
counter
some
thirty
feet
long
and
previously
one
of
the
features
of
the
station
now
strewed
the
floor
in
particles
suggesting
gravel
it
was
indeed
an
amazing
sight
the
more
amazing
as
no
such
work
of
destruction
could
have
been
accomplished
without
extreme
labour
when
we
returned
to
the
inn
for
dinner
i
asked
some
questions
who
did
it
the
first
german
troops
that
came
here
was
the
answer
why
did
they
do
it
was
it
because
your
men
had
cut
the
telegraph
wires
and
destroyed
some
of
the
permanent
way
oh
no
they
expected
to
find
something
to
drink
in
the
and
when
they
discovered
that
everything
had
been
taken
away
they
set
about
breaking
the
fixtures
dear
nice
placid
german
soldiers
baulked
for
a
few
minutes
of
some
of
the
wine
of
france
in
the
morning
we
left
mantes
by
moonlight
at
the
appointed
hour
unaccompanied
however
by
any
escort
either
the
commandant
had
forgotten
the
matter
or
his
men
had
overslept
themselves
in
the
outskirts
we
were
stopped
by
a
sentry
who
carried
our
pass
to
a
where
a
noncommissioned
officer
inspected
it
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
then
on
we
went
again
for
another
furlong
or
so
when
we
were
once
more
challenged
this
time
by
the
german
as
we
resumed
our
journey
we
perceived
in
the
rear
a
small
party
of
hussars
who
did
not
follow
us
but
wheeled
suddenly
to
the
left
bent
no
doubt
on
some
reconnoitering
expedition
we
were
now
beyond
the
german
lines
and
the
dawn
was
breaking
yonder
was
the
seine
with
several
islands
lying
on
its
bosom
and
some
wooded
heights
rising
beyond
it
drawing
nearer
to
the
river
we
passed
through
the
village
of
rolleboise
which
gives
its
name
to
the
chief
tunnel
on
the
western
line
and
drove
across
the
debatable
ground
where
french
francstireurs
were
constantly
on
the
prowl
for
venturesome
uhlans
at
last
we
got
to
bonnières
a
little
place
of
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
inhabitants
on
the
limits
of
and
there
we
had
to
alight
for
the
vehicles
which
had
brought
us
from
saint
germain
could
proceed
no
further
fortunately
we
secured
others
and
went
on
towards
the
village
of
jeufosse
where
the
nearest
french
outposts
were
established
we
were
displaying
the
white
flag
but
the
first
french
sentries
we
met
young
fellows
of
the
mobile
guard
refused
for
a
little
while
to
let
us
pass
eventually
they
referred
the
matter
to
an
officer
who
on
discovering
that
we
were
english
and
had
come
from
paris
began
to
chat
with
us
in
a
very
friendly
manner
asking
all
the
usual
questions
about
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
capital
and
expressing
the
usual
satisfaction
that
the
city
could
still
hold
out
when
we
took
leave
he
cordially
wished
us
and
on
we
hastened
still
following
the
course
of
the
seine
to
the
little
town
of
vernon
its
inquisitive
inhabitants
at
once
surrounded
us
eager
to
know
who
we
were
whence
we
had
come
and
whither
we
were
going
but
we
did
not
tarry
many
minutes
for
we
suddenly
learnt
that
the
railway
communication
with
rouen
only
began
at
gaillon
several
leagues
further
on
and
that
there
was
only
one
train
a
day
the
question
which
immediately
arose
was
could
we
catch
it
on
we
went
then
once
more
this
time
up
over
and
down
a
succession
of
steep
hills
until
at
last
we
reached
gaillon
station
and
found
to
our
delight
that
the
train
would
not
start
for
another
twenty
minutes
all
our
companions
took
tickets
for
rouen
whence
they
intended
to
proceed
to
dieppe
or
le
hâvre
but
my
father
and
i
branched
off
before
reaching
the
norman
capital
and
after
arriving
at
elbeuf
travelled
through
the
departments
of
the
eure
and
the
orne
passing
alençon
on
our
way
to
le
mans
on
two
or
three
occasions
we
had
to
change
from
one
train
to
another
the
travelling
was
extremely
slow
and
there
were
innumerable
stoppages
the
lines
were
constantly
encumbered
with
vans
laden
with
military
supplies
and
the
stations
were
full
of
troops
going
in
one
and
another
direction
in
the
one
found
crowds
of
officers
lying
on
the
couches
the
chairs
and
the
tables
and
striving
to
snatch
a
few
hours
sleep
whilst
all
over
the
floors
and
the
platforms
soldiers
had
stretched
themselves
for
the
same
purpose
very
seldom
could
any
food
be
obtained
but
i
luckily
secured
a
loaf
some
cheese
and
a
bottle
of
wine
at
alençon
it
must
have
been
about
one
in
the
morning
when
we
at
last
reached
le
mans
and
found
that
there
would
be
no
train
going
to
rennes
for
another
four
or
five
hours
the
big
of
le
mans
was
full
of
reinforcements
for
the
army
of
the
loire
after
strolling
about
for
a
few
minutes
my
father
and
i
sat
down
on
the
platform
with
our
backs
against
a
wall
for
not
a
bench
or
a
stool
was
available
every
now
and
again
some
train
prepared
to
start
men
were
hastily
mustered
and
then
climbed
into
all
sorts
of
carriages
and
vans
a
belated
general
rushed
along
accompanied
by
eager
now
and
again
a
rifle
slipped
from
the
hand
of
some
mobile
guard
who
had
been
imbibing
too
freely
and
fell
with
a
clatter
on
the
platform
then
stores
were
bundled
into
trucks
whistles
sounded
engines
puffed
and
meanwhile
although
men
were
constantly
departing
the
station
seemed
to
be
as
crowded
as
ever
when
at
last
i
got
up
to
stretch
myself
i
noticed
affixed
to
the
wall
against
which
i
had
been
leaning
a
proclamation
of
gambetta
respecting
de
paladines
victory
over
von
der
tann
at
orleans
in
another
part
of
the
station
were
lithographed
notices
emanating
from
the
prefect
of
the
department
and
reciting
a
variety
of
recent
government
decrees
and
items
of
war
news
skirmishes
reconnaissances
and
so
forth
at
last
however
our
train
came
in
it
was
composed
almost
entirely
of
carriages
with
wooden
seats
and
we
had
to
be
content
with
that
accommodation
another
long
and
wearisome
journey
then
began
again
we
travelled
slowly
again
there
were
innumerable
stoppages
again
we
passed
trains
crowded
with
soldiers
or
crammed
full
of
military
stores
at
some
place
where
we
stopped
there
was
a
train
conveying
some
scores
of
horses
mostly
poor
miserable
old
creatures
i
looked
and
wondered
at
the
sight
of
them
they
have
come
from
england
said
a
every
boat
from
southampton
to
saint
malo
brings
over
quite
a
number
it
was
unpleasant
to
think
that
such
beasts
had
been
shipped
by
one
own
countrymen
however
we
reached
rennes
at
last
and
were
there
able
to
get
a
good
square
meal
and
also
to
send
a
telegram
to
my
stepmother
notifying
her
of
our
early
arrival
it
was
however
at
a
late
hour
that
we
arrived
at
saint
malo
whence
we
drove
to
la
petite
amelia
at
saint
servan
the
latter
town
then
contained
a
considerable
colony
of
english
people
among
whom
the
military
element
predominated
quite
a
number
of
or
retired
officers
had
come
to
live
there
with
their
families
finding
jersey
overcrowded
and
desiring
to
practise
economy
the
colony
also
included
several
irish
landlords
in
reduced
circumstances
who
had
quitted
the
restless
isle
to
escape
assassination
at
the
hands
of
rory
of
the
hills
and
folk
of
his
stamp
in
addition
there
were
several
maiden
ladies
of
divers
ages
but
all
of
slender
means
one
or
two
courtesy
lords
of
high
descent
but
burdened
with
numerous
offspring
together
with
a
who
wrote
novels
and
an
elderly
clergyman
appointed
by
the
bishop
of
gibraltar
i
dare
say
there
may
have
been
a
few
black
sheep
in
the
colony
but
the
picture
which
annie
edwardes
gave
of
it
in
her
novel
susan
fielding
was
exaggerated
though
there
was
truth
in
the
incidents
which
she
introduced
into
another
of
her
works
ought
we
to
visit
her
on
the
whole
the
saint
servan
colony
was
a
very
respectable
one
even
if
it
was
not
possessed
of
any
great
means
going
there
during
my
holidays
i
met
many
young
fellows
of
my
own
age
or
thereabouts
and
mostly
belonging
to
military
families
there
were
also
several
charming
girls
both
english
and
irish
with
the
young
fellows
i
boated
with
the
young
ladies
i
played
croquet
now
whilst
my
father
and
i
had
been
shut
up
in
paris
we
had
frequently
written
to
my
stepmother
by
and
on
some
of
our
letters
being
shown
to
the
clergyman
of
the
colony
he
requested
permission
to
read
them
to
his
congregation
which
he
frequently
did
omitting
of
course
the
more
private
passages
but
giving
all
the
items
of
news
and
comments
on
the
situation
which
the
letters
contained
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
helped
the
reverend
gentleman
out
of
a
difficulty
he
was
an
excellent
man
but
like
many
others
of
his
cloth
he
did
not
know
how
to
preach
in
fact
a
year
or
two
later
i
myself
wrote
one
or
two
sermons
for
him
working
into
them
certain
matters
of
interest
to
the
colony
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
siege
of
paris
however
the
reading
of
my
letters
and
my
own
from
the
pulpit
at
the
close
of
the
usual
service
saved
the
colony
pastor
from
the
trouble
of
composing
a
bad
sermon
or
of
picking
out
an
indifferent
one
from
some
forgotten
theological
work
my
father
on
arriving
at
saint
servan
secluded
himself
as
far
as
possible
so
as
to
rest
awhile
before
proceeding
to
england
but
i
went
about
much
as
usual
and
my
letters
read
from
the
pulpit
and
sundry
other
matters
having
made
me
a
kind
of
public
character
i
was
at
once
pounced
upon
in
the
streets
carried
off
to
the
club
and
to
private
houses
and
there
questioned
and
by
a
dozen
or
twenty
crimean
and
indian
veteran
officers
who
were
following
the
progress
of
the
war
with
a
passionate
interest
a
year
or
two
previously
moreover
my
stepmother
had
formed
a
close
friendship
with
one
of
the
chief
french
families
of
the
town
the
father
a
retired
officer
of
the
french
naval
service
was
to
have
commanded
a
local
marching
battalion
but
he
unfortunately
sickened
and
died
leaving
his
wife
with
one
daughter
a
beautiful
girl
who
was
of
about
my
own
age
now
this
family
had
been
joined
by
the
wife
parents
an
elderly
couple
who
on
the
approach
of
the
germans
to
paris
had
quitted
the
suburb
where
they
resided
i
was
often
with
these
friends
at
saint
servan
and
on
arriving
there
from
paris
our
conversation
naturally
turned
on
the
war
as
the
old
gentleman
house
in
the
environs
of
the
capital
was
well
within
the
french
lines
he
had
not
much
reason
to
fear
for
its
safety
and
moreover
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
remove
his
valuables
into
the
city
but
he
was
sorely
perturbed
by
all
the
conflicting
news
respecting
the
military
operations
in
the
provinces
the
reported
victories
which
turned
out
to
be
defeats
the
adverse
rumours
concerning
the
condition
of
the
french
forces
the
alleged
scandal
of
the
camp
of
conlie
where
the
more
recent
breton
levies
were
said
to
be
dying
off
like
rotten
sheep
and
many
other
matters
besides
every
evening
when
i
called
on
these
friends
the
conversation
was
the
same
the
ladies
the
grandmother
the
daughter
and
the
granddaughter
sat
there
making
garments
for
the
soldiers
or
preparing
lint
for
the
wounded
those
being
the
constant
occupations
of
the
women
of
brittany
during
all
the
hours
they
could
spare
from
their
household
duties
and
meanwhile
the
old
gentleman
discussed
with
me
both
the
true
and
the
spurious
news
of
the
day
the
result
of
those
conversations
was
that
as
soon
as
my
father
had
betaken
himself
to
england
i
resolved
to
go
to
the
front
myself
ascertain
as
much
of
the
truth
as
i
could
and
become
indeed
a
on
my
own
in
forming
that
decision
i
was

had

that
provincial
france
might
be
capable
of
a
great
effort
they
relied
chiefly
on
the
imprisoned
army
of
paris
as
is
shown
by
all
their
despatches
and
subsequent
apologies
however
followed
crémieux
to
tours
where
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
government
delegation
should
instal
itself
and
he
was
accompanied
by
admiral
fourichon
the
minister
of
marine
on
reaching
the
loire
region
the
new
authorities
found
a
few
battalions
of
mobile
guards
and
a
battalion
of
sharpshooters
previously
brought
from
algeria
one
or
two
batteries
of
artillery
and
a
cavalry
division
of
four
regiments
commanded
by
general
reyau
this
division
had
been
gathered
together
in
the
final
days
of
the
empire
and
was
to
have
been
sent
to
mezieres
to
assist
macmahon
in
his
effort
to
succour
bazaine
but
on
failing
to
get
there
it
had
made
just
a
few
vain
attempts
to
check
the
germans
in
their
advance
on
paris
and
had
then
fallen
back
to
the
south
of
the
capital
general
lefort
first
task
was
to
collect
the
necessary
elements
for
an
additional
army
corps
the
and
he
summoned
to
his
assistance
the
veteran
general
de
la
previously
a
very
capable
officer
but
now
almost
a
septuagenarian
whose
particular
fad
it
was
to
dye
his
hair
and
thereby
endeavour
to
make
himself
look
no
more
than
fifty
no
doubt
hi
the
seventeenth
century
the
famous
prince
de
condé
with
the
eagle
glance
took
a
score
of
wigs
with
him
when
he
started
on
a
campaign
but
even
such
a
practice
as
that
is
not
suited
to
modern
conditions
of
warfare
though
be
it
admitted
that
it
takes
less
time
to
change
one
wig
than
to
have
one
hair
dyed
the
latter
practice
may
of
course
help
a
man
to
cut
a
fine
figure
on
parade
but
it
is
of
no
utility
in
the
field
in
a
controversy
which
arose
after
the
publication
of
zola
novel
la
débâole
there
was
a
conflict
of
evidence
as
to
whether
the
cheeks
of
napoleon
iii
were
or
were
not
rouged
in
order
to
conceal
his
ghastly
pallor
on
the
fatal
day
of
sedan
that
may
always
remain
a
moot
point
but
it
is
i
think
certain
that
during
the
last
two
years
of
his
rule
his
moustache
and
imperial
were
dyed
but
let
me
return
to
the
national
defence
paris
as
i
formerly
mentioned
was
invested
on
september
on
the
a
bavarian
force
occupied
the
village
of
longjumeau
referred
to
in
my
account
of
my
journey
to
versailles
a
couple
of
days
later
the
fourth
division
of
german
cavalry
commanded
by
prince
albert
the
elder
of
prussia
started
southward
through
the
departments
of
and
loiret
going
towards
artenay
in
the
direction
of
orleans
this
division
which
met
at
first
with
little
opposition
belonged
to
a
force
which
was
detached
from
the
main
army
of
the
crown
prince
of
prussia
and
placed
under
the
command
of
the
frederick
francis
of
near
this
as
the
germans
called
it
was
the
first
bavarian
army
corps
which
had
fought
at
bazeilles
on
the
day
of
sedan
it
was
commanded
by
general
von
und
zu
der
commonly
called
von
der
tann
as
prince
albert
of
prussia
on
drawing
near
to
artenay
found
a
good
many
french
soldiers
both
regulars
and
irregulars
that
is
located
in
the
district
he
deemed
it
best
to
retire
on
toury
and
pithiviers
but
his
appearance
so
far
south
had
sufficed
to
alarm
the
french
commander
at
orleans
general
de
polhès
who
at
once
ordered
his
men
to
evacuate
the
city
and
retire
partly
on
blois
and
partly
on
la
this
pusillanimity
incensed
the
delegates
of
the
national
defence
and
polhès
was
momentarily
superseded
by
general
reyau
and
later
october
by
la
it
is
known
nowadays
that
the
germans
were
at
first
perplexed
as
to
the
best
course
to
pursue
after
they
had
completed
the
investment
of
paris
moltke
had
not
anticipated
a
long
siege
of
the
french
capital
he
had
imagined
that
the
city
would
speedily
surrender
and
that
the
war
would
then
come
to
an
end
fully
acquainted
with
the
tract
of
country
lying
between
the
rhine
and
paris
he
had
much
less
knowledge
of
other
parts
of
france
and
moreover
although
he
had
long
known
how
many
men
could
be
placed
in
the
field
by
the
military
organisation
of
the
empire
he
undoubtedly
underestimated
the
further
resources
of
the
french
and
did
not
anticipate
any
vigorous
provincial
resistance
his
sovereign
king
william
formed
a
more
correct
estimate
respecting
the
prolongation
of
the
struggle
and
as
was
mentioned
by
me
in
my
previous
book
republican
france
he
more
than
once
rectified
the
mistakes
which
were
made
by
the
great
german
strategist
the
invader
objective
with
respect
to
central
france
was
bourges
the
old
capital
of
berry
renowned
for
its
ordnance
and
ammunition
works
and
in
the
days
when
the
troops
of
our
henry
v
overran
france
the
scene
of
charles
vii
retirement
before
he
was
inspirited
either
by
agnes
sorel
or
by
joan
of
arc
to
enable
an
army
coming
from
the
direction
of
paris
to
seize
bourges
it
is
in
the
first
instance
necessary
as
a
reference
to
any
map
of
france
will
show
to
secure
possession
of
orleans
which
is
situated
at
the
most
northern
point
the
apex
so
to
say
of
the
course
of
the
loire
and
is
only
about
miles
from
paris
at
the
same
time
it
is
advisable
that
any
advance
upon
orleans
should
be
covered
westward
by
a
corresponding
advance
on
chartres
and
thence
on
châteaudun
this
became
the
german
plan
and
whilst
a
force
under
general
von
wittich
marched
on
chartres
von
der
tann
men
approached
orleans
through
the
beauce
region
from
the
forest
of
dourdan
on
the
north
to
the
loire
on
the
south
and
from
the
chartres
region
on
the
west
to
the
gatinais
on
the
east
this
great
plateau
the
scene
of
zola
famous
novel
la
terre
is
almost
level
although
its
soil
is
very
fertile
there
are
few
watercourses
in
beauce
none
of
them
moreover
being
of
a
nature
to
impede
the
march
of
an
army
the
roads
are
lined
with
stunted
elms
and
here
and
there
a
small
copse
a
straggling
farm
a
little
village
may
be
seen
together
with
many
a
row
of
stacks
the
whole
forming
in
late
autumn
and
in
winter
when
hurricanes
rain
and
sweep
across
the
great
expanse
as
dreary
a
picture
as
the
most
individual
could
desire
whilst
there
is
no
natural
obstacle
to
impede
the
advance
of
an
invader
there
is
also
no
cover
for
purposes
of
defence
all
the
way
from
chartres
to
orleans
the
is
not
once
intersected
by
a
river
nearly
all
of
the
few
streams
which
exist
thereabouts
run
from
south
to
north
and
they
supply
no
means
of
defence
against
an
army
coming
from
the
direction
of
paris
the
region
is
one
better
suited
for
the
employment
of
cavalry
and
artillery
than
for
that
of
the
chartres
country
is
better
watered
than
beaude
westward
in
both
of
the
districts
of
perche
going
either
towards
mortagne
or
towards
the
country
is
more
hilly
and
more
wooded
and
hedges
ditches
and
dingle
paths
abound
there
in
such
districts
infantry
can
well
be
employed
for
defensive
purposes
beyond
the
loir
not
the
loire
of
chartres
is
the
pays
dunois
that
is
the
district
of
châteaudun
a
little
town
protected
on
the
north
and
the
west
by
the
loir
and
the
conie
and
by
the
hills
between
which
those
rivers
flow
but
open
to
any
attack
on
the
east
from
which
direction
indeed
the
germans
naturally
approached
it
beyond
the
loire
to
the
of
beauce
and
orleans
lies
the
region
called
sologne
which
the
germans
would
have
had
to
cross
had
they
prosecuted
their
intended
march
on
bourges
here
cavalry
and
artillery
are
of
little
use
the
country
abounding
in
streams
ponds
and
marshes
quite
apart
however
from
natural
obstacles
no
advance
on
bourges
could
well
be
prosecuted
so
long
as
the
french
held
orleans
and
even
when
that
city
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
germans
the
presence
of
large
french
forces
on
the
west
compelled
the
invaders
to
carry
hostilities
in
that
direction
and
abandon
their
projected
march
southward
thus
the
campaign
in
which
i
became
interested
was
carried
on
principally
in
the
departments
of
loiret
and
sarthe
to
terminate
at
last
in
mayenne
great
indiscipline
prevailed
among
the
troops
whom
la
had
under
his
orders
an
attack
by
von
der
tann
to
the
north
of
orleans
on
october
led
to
the
retreat
of
a
part
of
the
french
forces
on
the
following
day
when
the
french
had
from
to
men
engaged
they
were
badly
defeated
some
of
their
men
being
put
de
and
as
many
being
taken
prisoners
this
reverse
which
was
due
partly
to
some
mistakes
made
by
la
and
partly
to
the
inferior
quality
of
his
troops
led
to
the
immediate
evacuation
of
orleans
now
it
was
precisely
at
this
moment
that
gambetta
appeared
upon
the
scene
he
had
left
paris
it
will
be
remembered
on
october
on
the
he
was
at
rouen
on
the
he
joined
the
other
government
delegates
at
tours
and
on
the
the
eve
of
la
defeat
he
became
minister
of
war
as
well
as
minister
of
the
interior
previously
the
portfolio
for
war
had
been
held
in
the
provinces
by
admiral
fourichon
with
general
lefort
as
his
assistant
but
fourichon
had
resigned
in
connexion
with
a
communalist
rising
which
had
taken
place
at
lyons
towards
the
end
of
september
when
the
prefect
was
momentarily
made
a
prisoner
by
the
insurgents
but
was
afterwards
released
by
some
loyal
national
guards
see
my
book
the
anarchists
their
faith
and
their
record
john
lane
complaining
that
general
mazure
commander
of
the
garrison
had
not
done
his
duty
on
this
occasion
caused
him
to
be
arrested
and
fourichon
siding
with
the
general
thereupon
resigned
the
war
ministry
crémieux
taking
it
over
until
gambetta
arrival
it
may
well
be
asked
how
one
could
expect
the
military
affairs
of
france
to
prosper
when
they
were
subordinated
to
such
wretched
squabbles
among
the
men
whom
gambetta
found
at
tours
was
an
engineer
who
after
the
revolution
of
september
had
been
appointed
prefect
of
but
who
coming
into
conflict
with
the
extremists
of
montauban
much
as
had
come
into
conflict
with
those
of
lyons
had
promptly
resigned
his
functions
his
name
was
charles
louis
de
saulces
de
freycinet
and
though
he
was
born
at
foix
near
the
pyrenees
he
belonged
to
an
ancient
family
of
dauphiné
at
this
period
october
freycinet
had
nearly
completed
his
year
after
qualifying
as
an
engineer
at
the
ecole
polytechnique
he
had
held
various
posts
at
chartres
and
bordeaux
before
securing
in
the
position
of
to
the
chemin
de
fer
du
midi
subsequently
he
was
entrusted
with
various
missions
abroad
and
in
the
institute
of
france
crowned
a
little
work
of
his
on
the
employment
of
women
and
children
in
english
factories
mining
engineering
was
his
speciality
but
he
was
extremely
versatile
and
resourceful
and
immediately
attracted
the
notice
of
gambetta
let
it
be
said
to
the
latter
credit
that
in
that
hour
of
crisis
he
cast
all
prejudices
aside
he
cared
nothing
for
the
antecedents
of
any
man
who
was
willing
to
cooperate
in
the
defence
of
france
and
thus
although
freycinet
came
of
an
house
and
had
made
his
way
under
the
empire
which
had
created
him
first
a
chevalier
and
then
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honour
gambetta
at
once
selected
him
to
act
as
his
and
delegate
in
military
affairs
at
this
moment
the
national
defence
had
in
or
ready
for
the
field
only
regular
infantry
a
like
number
of
mobile
guards
from
to
cavalry
and
about
guns
some
of
antiquated
models
and
with
very
few
men
to
serve
them
there
were
certainly
a
good
many
men
at
various
regimental
dépôts
together
with
mobile
guards
and
national
guards
in
all
the
uninvaded
provinces
of
france
but
all
these
had
to
be
drilled
equipped
and
armed
that
was
the
first
part
of
the
great
task
which
lay
before
gambetta
and
freycinet
within
a
month
however
leaving
aside
what
was
done
in
other
parts
of
the
country
france
had
on
the
loire
alone
an
army
of
men
who
for
a
moment
at
all
events
turned
the
tide
of
war
at
the
same
time
i
would
add
that
before
gambetta
arrival
on
the
scene
the
national
defence
delegates
had
begun
to
concentrate
some
small
bodies
of
troops
both
in
normandy
and
in
picardy
and
artois
the
latter
forming
the
first
nucleus
of
the
army
of
the
north
which
faidherbe
afterwards
commanded
further
in
the
east
of
france
there
was
a
force
under
general
cambriels
whose
object
was
to
cut
the
german
communications
in
the
vosges
von
der
tann
having
defeated
la
occupied
orleans
whilst
the
french
withdrew
across
the
loire
to
la
and
gien
south
and
of
their
former
position
gambetta
had
to
take
action
immediately
he
did
so
by
removing
la
from
his
command
which
he
gave
to
de
paladines
the
latter
a
general
on
the
reserve
list
with
a
distinguished
record
was
in
his
year
having
been
born
at
languedoc
in
he
had
abilities
as
an
organiser
and
was
known
to
be
a
disciplinarian
but
he
was
growing
old
and
looked
confidence
both
in
himself
and
in
his
men
at
the
moment
of
appointment
von
der
tann
wished
to
advance
on
bourges
in
accordance
with
moltke
instructions
and
in
doing
so
he
proposed
to
evacuate
orleans
but
this
was
forbidden
by
king
william
and
the
crown
prince
and
in
the
result
the
bavarian
general
suffered
a
repulse
at
salbris
which
checked
his
advance
southward
still
covering
bourges
and
vierzon
soon
had
men
under
his
orders
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
gambetta
and
freyeinet
but
the
enemy
were
now
making
progress
to
the
west
of
orleans
in
which
direction
the
tragic
affair
of
châteaudun
occurred
on
october
the
german
column
operating
on
that
side
under
general
von
wittich
consisted
of
infantry
four
batteries
and
a
cavalry
regiment
which
advanced
on
châteaudun
from
the
east
and
on
being
resisted
by
the
villagers
of
varize
and
civry
shot
them
down
without
mercy
and
set
all
their
houses
about
in
number
on
fire
nevertheless
that
punishment
did
not
deter
the
national
guards
of
châteaudun
and
the
who
had
joined
them
from
offering
the
most
strenuous
opposition
to
the
invaders
though
the
latter
numerical
superiority
alone
was
as
seven
to
one
the
fierce
fight
was
followed
by
terrible
scenes
most
of
the
who
had
not
fallen
in
the
engagement
effected
a
retreat
and
on
discovering
this
the
infuriated
germans
to
whom
the
mere
name
of
was
as
a
red
rag
to
a
bull
did
not
scruple
to
shoot
down
a
number
of
including
women
and
children
i
remember
the
excitement
which
the
news
of
the
châteaudun
affair
occasioned
in
besieged
paris
and
when
i
left
the
capital
a
few
weeks
later
i
heard
it
constantly
spoken
of
in
vain
did
the
germans
strive
to
gloss
over
the
truth
the
proofs
were
too
numerous
and
the
reality
was
too
dreadful
two
hundred
and
of
the
devoted
little
town
houses
were
committed
to
the
flames
for
the
first
time
in
the
whole
course
of
the
war
women
were
deliberately
assaulted
and
a
couple
of
german
princes
disgraced
their
exalted
station
in
a
drunken
and
incendiary
orgie
meantime
in
the
east
of
france
cambriels
had
failed
in
his
attempt
to
cut
the
german
communications
and
had
been
compelled
to
beat
a
retreat
it
must
be
said
for
him
that
his
troops
were
a
very
sorry
lot
who
could
not
be
depended
upon
not
only
were
they
badly
disciplined
and
addicted
to
drunkenness
but
they
took
to
marauding
and
pillage
and
were
in
no
degree
a
match
for
the
men
whom
the
german
general
von
werder
led
against
them
garibaldi
the
italian
liberator
had
offered
his
sword
to
france
soon
after
the
fall
of
the
second
empire
on
october
that
is
a
day
before
gambetta
he
arrived
at
tours
to
arrange
for
a
command
like
that
of
cambriels
in
the
east
of
france
the
little
army
of
the
vosges
which
was
eventually
constituted
under
his
orders
was
made
up
of
very
heterogeneous
elements
italians
switzers
poles
hungarians
englishmen
as
well
as
frenchmen
were
to
be
found
in
its
ranks
the
general
could
not
be
called
a
very
old
man
being
indeed
only
years
of
age
but
he
had
led
an
eventful
and
arduous
life
and
as
will
be
remembered
ever
since
the
affair
of
aspromonte
in
he
had
been
lame
and
had
gradually
become
more
and
more
infirm
he
had
with
him
however
two
of
his
sons
menotti
and
ricoiotti
the
second
a
more
competent
soldier
than
the
first
and
several
able
men
such
as
his
compatriot
lobbia
and
the
pole
his
chief
of
staff
bordone
previously
a
navy
doctor
was
however
a
very
fussy
individual
who
imagined
himself
to
be
a
military
genius
among
the
englishmen
with
garibaldi
were
robert
middleton
and
my
brother
edward
vizetelly
and
there
was
an
englishwoman
jessie
white
mario
daughter
of
white
the
of
cowes
and
widow
of
mario
garibaldi
companion
in
arms
in
the
glorious
liberation
days
my
brother
often
told
me
that
mme
mario
was
equally
at
home
in
an
ambulance
or
in
a
charge
for
she
was
an
excellent
nurse
and
an
admirable
horsewoman
as
well
as
a
good
shot
she
is
one
of
the
women
of
whom
i
think
when
i
hear
or
read
that
the
members
of
the
completing
sex
can
not
fight
but
that
of
course
is
merely
the
opinion
of
some
medical
and
newspaper
men
mme
mario
contributed
a
certain
number
of
articles
to
the
so
did
my
brother
it
was
indeed
as
correspondent
that
he
first
joined
garibaldi
forces
but
he
speedily
became
an
orderly
to
the
general
and
later
a
captain
on
the
staff
he
was
at
the
battles
of
dijon
and
autun
and
served
under
lobbia
in
the
relief
of
langres
some
french
historians
of
these
later
days
have
written
so
slightingly
of
the
little
army
of
the
vosges
that
i
am
sorry
my
brother
did
not
leave
any
permanent
record
of
his
experiences
garibaldi
task
was
no
easy
one
in
the
first
instance
the
national
defence
hesitated
to
employ
him
secondly
they
wished
to
subordinate
him
to
cambriels
and
he
declined
to
take
any
such
position
not
that
he
objected
to
serve
under
any
superior
commander
who
would
treat
him
fairly
but
because
he
garibaldi
was
a
freethinker
and
knew
that
he
was
bitterly
detested
by
the
fervently
catholic
generals
such
as
cambriels
as
it
happened
he
secured
an
independent
command
but
in
exercising
it
he
had
to
with
cambriels
in
various
ways
and
in
later
years
my
brother
told
me
how
shamefully
cambriels
acted
more
than
once
towards
the
garibaldian
force
it
was
indeed
a
repetition
of
what
had
occurred
at
the
very
outset
of
the
war
when
such
intense
jealousy
had
existed
among
certain
marshals
and
generals
that
one
had
preferred
to
let
another
be
defeated
rather
than
march
at
the
sound
of
the
guns
to
his
assistance
i
also
remember
my
brother
telling
me
that
when
langres
which
is
in
the
haute
marne
west
of
the
aube
and
the
côte
was
relieved
by
column
the
commander
of
the
garrison
refused
at
first
to
let
the
garibaldians
enter
the
town
he
was
prepared
to
surrender
to
the
germans
if
necessary
but
the
thought
that
he
a
devout
catholic
should
owe
any
assistance
to
such
a
band
of
unbelieving
brigands
as
the
garibaldian
enemies
of
the
pope
was
absolutely
odious
to
him
fortunately
this
kind
of
feeling
did
not
show
itself
in
western
france
there
was
at
one
moment
some
little
difficulty
respecting
the
position
of
cathélineau
the
descendant
of
the
famous
vendéen
leader
but
on
the
whole
catholics
royalists
and
republicans
loyally
supported
one
another
fired
by
a
common
patriotism
the
failure
of
cambriel
attempts
to
cut
the
german
communications
and
the
relatively
small
importance
of
the
garibaldian
force
inspired
gambetta
with
the
idea
of
forming
a
large
army
of
the
east
which
with
langres
belfort
and
besançon
as
its
bases
would
vigorously
assume
the
offensive
in
that
part
of
france
moltke
however
had
already
sent
general
von
werder
orders
to
pursue
the
retreating
cambriels
various
engagements
late
in
october
were
followed
by
a
german
march
on
dijon
there
were
at
this
time
or
mobile
guards
in
the
côte
but
no
general
in
command
of
them
authority
was
exercised
by
a
civilian
lavalle
the
forces
assembled
at
dijon
and
beaune
amounted
inclusive
of
regulars
and
national
guards
to
about
men
but
they
were
very
badly
equipped
and
armed
and
their
officers
were
few
in
number
and
of
very
indifferent
ability
werder
came
down
on
dijon
in
a
somewhat
hesitating
way
like
a
man
who
is
not
sure
of
his
ground
or
of
the
strength
of
the
enemy
in
front
of
him
but
the
french
were
alarmed
by
his
approach
and
on
october
dijon
was
evacuated
and
soon
afterwards
occupied
by
werder
with
two
brigades
three
days
previously
metz
had
surrendered
and
france
was
reeling
under
the
unexpected
blow
in
spite
of
all
the
ardent
proclamations
with
which
gambetta
strove
to
impart
hope
and
stimulate
patriotism
capitulation
naturally
implied
the
release
of
the
forces
under
prince
frederick
charles
by
which
he
had
been
invested
and
their
transfer
to
other
parts
of
france
for
a
more
vigorous
prosecution
of
the
invasion
werder
after
occupying
dijon
was
to
have
gone
westward
through
the
nivernais
in
order
to
assist
other
forces
in
the
designs
on
bourges
but
some
days
before
metz
actually
fell
moltke
sent
him
different
instructions
setting
forth
that
he
was
to
take
no
further
account
of
bourges
but
to
hold
dijon
and
concentrate
at
vesoul
keeping
a
watch
on
langres
and
besançon
for
a
moment
however
french
under
an
officer
named
fauconnet
suddenly
recaptured
dijon
though
there
were
more
than
badeners
installed
there
under
general
von
beyer
unfortunately
fauconnet
was
killed
in
the
affair
a
fresh
evacuation
of
the
burgundian
capital
ensued
and
the
germans
then
remained
in
possession
of
the
city
for
more
than
a
couple
of
months
in
the
west
the
army
of
the
loire
was
being
steadily
increased
and
consolidated
thanks
to
the
untiring
efforts
of
gambetta
freycinet
and
the
last
of
whom
certainly
contributed
largely
to
the
organization
of
the
force
though
he
was
little
inclined
to
quit
his
lines
and
assume
the
offensive
it
was
undoubtedly
on
this
army
that
gambetta
based
his
principal
hopes
the
task
assigned
to
it
was
greater
than
those
allotted
to
any
of
the
other
armies
which
were
gradually
assuming
shape
being
indeed
the
relief
of
beleaguered
paris
trochu
own
memoirs
show
that
at
the
outset
of
the
siege
his
one
thought
was
to
remain
on
the
defensive
in
this
connexion
it
is
held
nowadays
that
he
misjudged
the
german
temperament
that
remembering
the
vigorous
attempts
of
the
allies
on
sebastopol
he
was
as
we
know
in
the
crimea
at
the
time
he
imagined
that
the
germans
would
make
similarly
vigorous
attempts
on
paris
he
did
not
expect
a
long
and
so
to
say
passive
siege
a
mere
blockade
during
which
the
investing
army
would
simply
content
itself
with
repulsing
the
efforts
of
the
besieged
to
break
through
its
lines
he
knew
that
the
germans
had
behaved
differently
in
the
case
of
strasbourg
and
some
other
eastern
strongholds
and
anticipated
a
similar
line
of
action
with
respect
to
the
french
capital
but
the
germans
preferred
to
follow
a
waiting
policy
towards
both
metz
and
paris
it
has
been
said
that
this
was
less
the
idea
of
moltke
than
that
of
bismarck
whose
famous
phrase
about
letting
the
parisians
stew
in
their
own
juice
will
be
remembered
but
one
should
also
recollect
that
both
metz
and
paris
were
defended
by
great
forces
and
that
there
was
little
likelihood
of
any
de
succeeding
whilst
as
for
bombardment
though
it
might
have
some
moral
it
would
probably
have
very
little
material
effect
metz
was
not
really
bombarded
and
the
attempt
to
bombard
paris
was
deferred
for
several
months
when
it
at
last
took
place
a
certain
number
of
buildings
were
damaged
persons
were
killed
and
persons
wounded
a
material
effect
which
can
only
be
described
as
absolutely
trivial
in
the
case
of
so
great
and
so
populous
a
city
trochu
idea
to
remain
merely
on
the
defensive
did
not
appeal
to
his
coadjutor
general
ducrot
the
latter
had
wished
to
break
through
the
german
lines
on
the
day
of
sedan
and
he
now
wished
to
break
through
them
round
paris
various
schemes
occurred
to
him
one
was
to
make
a
sortie
in
the
direction
of
le
bourget
and
the
plain
of
saint
denis
but
it
seemed
useless
to
attempt
to
break
out
on
the
north
as
the
germans
held
laon
soissons
la
fère
and
amiens
there
was
also
an
idea
of
making
an
attempt
on
the
south
in
the
direction
of
villejuif
but
everything
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
germans
were
extremely
strong
on
this
side
of
the
city
and
occupied
no
little
of
the
surrounding
country
the
question
of
a
sortie
on
the
east
across
the
marne
was
also
mooted
and
dismissed
for
various
reasons
the
idea
finally
adopted
being
to
break
out
by
way
of
the
gennevilliers
peninsula
formed
by
the
course
of
the
seine
on
the
and
then
the
heights
of
cormeil
having
been
secured
to
cross
the
oise
and
afterwards
march
on
rouen
where
it
would
be
possible
to
victual
the
army
moreover
instructions
were
to
be
sent
into
the
provinces
in
order
that
both
the
forces
on
the
loire
and
those
in
the
north
might
bear
towards
normandy
and
there
join
the
army
from
paris
in
such
wise
that
there
would
be
a
quarter
of
a
million
men
between
dieppe
rouen
and
caen
trochu
ended
by
agreeing
to
this
scheme
and
even
entertained
a
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
revictual
paris
by
way
of
the
seine
for
which
purpose
a
flotilla
of
boats
was
prepared
ducrot
and
he
expected
to
be
ready
by
november
or
but
it
is
said
that
they
were
hampered
in
their
preparations
by
the
objections
raised
by
guiod
and
the
former
an
engineer
and
the
latter
an
artillery
general
moreover
the
course
of
events
in
the
provinces
suddenly
caused
a
complete
reversal
of
ducrot
plans
on
november
de
paladines
defeated
von
der
tann
at
coulmiers
west
of
orleans
the
young
french
troops
behaved
extremely
well
but
the
victory
not
being
followed
up
with
sufficient
vigour
by
remained
somewhat
incomplete
though
it
constrained
the
germans
to
evacuate
orleans
on
the
whole
this
was
the
first
considerable
success
achieved
by
the
french
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
it
did
much
to
revive
the
spirits
which
had
been
drooping
since
the
fall
of
metz
another
of
its
results
was
to
change
ducrot
plans
respecting
the
paris
sortie
he
and
trochu
had
hitherto
taken
little
account
of
the
provincial
armies
and
the
success
of
coulmiers
came
to
them
as
a
surprise
and
a
revelation
there
really
was
an
army
of
the
loire
then
and
it
was
advancing
on
paris
from
orleans
the
parisian
forces
must
therefore
break
out
on
the
and
join
hands
with
this
army
of
relief
in
or
near
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
thus
all
the
preparations
for
a
sortie
by
way
of
gennevilliers
were
abandoned
and
followed
by
others
for
an
attempt
in
the
direction
of
champigny
such
was
roughly
the
position
at
the
time
when
i
reached
brittany
and
conceived
the
idea
of
joining
the
french
forces
on
the
loire
and
forwarding
some
account
of
their
operations
to
england
during
my
stay
in
paris
with
my
father
i
had
assisted
him
in
preparing
several
articles
and
had
written
others
on
my
own
account
my
eldest
brother
adrian
vizetelly
was
at
this
time
at
the
institution
of
naval
architects
he
had
been
a
student
at
the
royal
school
of
naval
architecture
with
the
whites
elgars
yarrows
turnbulls
and
other
famous
shipbuilders
and
on
quitting
it
had
taken
the
in
question
as
an
occupation
pending
some
suitable
vacancy
in
the
government
service
or
some
large
private
yard
the
famous
naval
constructor
reed
had
started
in
life
in
precisely
the
same
post
and
it
was
indeed
at
his
personal
suggestion
that
my
brother
took
it
a
year
or
two
later
he
and
his
friend
francis
elgar
subsequently
director
of
dockyards
and
one
of
the
heads
of
the
fairfield
shipbuilding
company
were
assisting
reed
to
run
his
review
at
the
time
of
the
war
however
my
brother
then
in
his
year
was
writing
on
naval
subjects
for
the
and
the
mall
gazette
edited
respectively
by
john
robinson
and
frederick
greenwood
a
few
articles
written
by
me
during
my
siege
days
were
sent
direct
to
the
latter
by
but
i
knew
not
what
their
fate
might
be
the
might
be
unable
to
use
them
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
their
being
returned
to
me
in
paris
my
father
whom
i
assisted
in
preparing
a
variety
of
articles
suggested
that
everything
of
this
kind
that
is
work
not
intended
for
the
london
should
be
sent
to
my
brother
for
him
to
deal
with
as
opportunity
offered
he
placed
a
few
articles
with
notably
some
rather
long
ones
on
the
fortifications
and
armament
of
paris
whilst
others
went
to
the
and
the
when
after
coming
out
of
paris
i
arrived
in
brittany
i
heard
that
virtually
everything
sent
from
the
capital
by
my
father
or
myself
had
been
used
in
one
or
another
paper
and
was
not
a
little
pleased
to
receive
a
draft
on
a
saint
malo
for
my
share
of
the
proceeds
this
money
enabled
me
to
proceed
in
the
first
instance
in
the
direction
of
le
mans
which
the
germans
were
already
threatening
before
referring
however
to
my
own
experiences
i
must
say
something
further
respecting
the
general
position
the
battle
of
coulmiers
november
was
followed
by
a
period
of
inaction
on
the
part
of
the
loire
army
had
pursued
von
der
tann
he
might
have
turned
his
barren
victory
to
good
account
but
he
had
not
much
confidence
in
his
troops
and
the
weather
was
bad
sleet
and
snow
falling
continually
moreover
the
french
commander
believed
that
the
bavarian
retreat
concealed
a
trap
at
a
conference
held
between
him
gambetta
freyoinet
and
the
generals
at
the
head
of
the
various
army
corps
only
one
of
the
latter
favoured
an
immediate
march
on
paris
borel
who
was
chief
of
staff
proposed
to
confine
operations
to
an
advance
on
chartres
which
would
certainly
have
been
a
good
position
to
occupy
for
it
would
have
brought
the
army
nearer
to
the
capital
giving
it
two
railway
lines
those
of
le
mans
and
granville
for
revictualling
purposes
and
enabling
it
to
retreat
on
brittany
in
the
event
of
any
serious
reverse
but
no
advance
at
all
was
made
the
germans
were
allowed
all
necessary
time
to
increase
their
forces
the
french
remaining
inactive
within
lines
and
their
steadily
declining
by
reason
of
the
hardships
to
which
they
were
subjected
the
refused
to
billet
them
in
the
villages
for
fear
said
he
of
indiscipline
and
compelled
them
to
bivouack
under
canvas
in
the
mud
seldom
moreover
allowing
any
fires
to
be
kindled
for
a
score
of
days
did
this
state
of
affairs
continue
and
the
effect
of
it
was
seen
at
the
battle
of
the
responsibility
for
the
treatment
of
the
troops
rests
on
memory
and
that
of
some
of
his
meantime
gambetta
and
freycinet
were
exerting
themselves
to
improve
the
situation
generally
they
realized
that
the
release
of
prince
frederick
charles
forces
from
the
investment
of
metz
necessitated
the
reinforcement
of
the
army
of
the
loire
and
they
took
steps
accordingly
cambriels
had
now
been
replaced
in
eastern
france
by
a
certain
general
michel
who
lost
his
head
and
was
superseded
by
his
comrade
crouzat
the
had
with
him
men
and
guns
to
contend
against
the
men
and
the
guns
of
army
in
order
to
strengthen
the
loire
forces
however
half
of
men
and
he
himself
received
orders
to
approach
orleans
by
way
of
nevers
and
gien
the
remainder
of
his
army
being
instructed
to
retire
on
lyons
in
order
to
quiet
the
agitation
prevailing
in
that
city
which
regarded
itself
as
defenceless
and
complained
bitterly
thereof
although
there
was
no
likelihood
at
all
of
a
german
attack
for
at
least
some
time
to
come
the
new
arrangements
left
garibaldi
chief
commander
in
eastern
france
though
the
forces
directly
under
his
orders
did
not
at
this
time
exceed
men
and
included
moreover
no
fewer
than
sixty
petty
who
cared
little
for
discipline
there
were
women
in
several
of
these
companies
one
of
the
latter
including
no
fewer
than
eighteen
amazons
a
month
or
two
previously
the
advent
of
from
twenty
to
thirty
thousand
italian
volunteers
had
been
confidently
prophesied
but
very
few
of
these
came
forward
nevertheless
ricciotti
garibaldi
with
whom
was
my
brother
edward
defeated
a
german
force
in
a
sharp
engagement
at
seine
november
and
a
week
later
the
garibaldians
made
a
gallant
attempt
to
recapture
the
city
of
dijon
five
thousand
men
however
were
of
no
avail
against
an
army
corps
and
thus
even
if
the
garibaldian
attack
had
momentarily
succeeded
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
hold
dijon
against
werder
troops
the
attempt
having
failed
the
german
commander
resolved
to
crush
the
army
of
the
vosges
which
fled
and
scattered
swiftly
pursued
by
a
brigade
under
general
von
keller
great
jealousy
prevailed
at
this
moment
among
the
french
generals
in
command
of
various
corps
which
might
have
helped
the
garibaldians
bressolles
crevisier
and
cremer
were
at
loggerheads
on
november
the
fought
an
indecisive
action
at
nuits
followed
nearly
three
weeks
later
by
another
in
which
he
claimed
the
victory
meantime
crouzat
force
now
known
as
the
army
corps
had
been
moving
on
nevers
to
assist
the
loire
army
yet
further
general
bourbaki
had
been
summoned
from
the
of
france
at
the
fall
of
the
empire
the
defence
in
that
part
of
the
country
had
been
entrusted
to
fririon
whom
espinet
de
la
villeboisnet
succeeded
the
resources
at
the
disposal
of
both
those
generals
were
very
limited
confined
indeed
to
men
of
the
regimental
dépôts
and
some
mobile
guards
there
was
a
deficiency
both
of
officers
and
of
weapons
and
in
the
early
skirmishes
which
took
place
with
the
enemy
the
principal
combatants
were
armed
peasants
rural
firemen
and
the
national
guards
of
various
towns
it
is
true
that
for
a
while
the
german
force
consisted
only
of
a
battalion
of
infantry
and
some
saxon
cavalry
under
anatole
de
la
forge
prefect
of
the
aisne
the
open
town
of
saint
quentin
offered
a
gallant
resistance
to
the
invader
but
although
this
had
some
moral
effect
its
importance
was
not
great
bourbaki
who
succeeded
la
villeboisnet
in
command
of
the
region
was
as
diffident
respecting
the
value
of
his
troops
as
was
on
the
loire
he
had
previously
commanded
the
very
pick
of
the
french
army
that
is
the
imperial
guard
and
the
men
now
placed
under
his
orders
were
by
no
means
of
the
same
class
bourbaki
was
at
this
time
only
years
of
age
and
when
after
being
sent
out
of
metz
on
a
mission
to
the
empress
eugénie
at
hastings
he
had
offered
his
services
to
the
national
defence
the
latter
had
given
him
the
best
possible
welcome
but
he
became
one
of
the
great
military
failures
of
the
period
after
the
fall
of
metz
the
germans
despatched
larger
forces
under
manteuffel
into
france
altogether
there
were
infantry
and
cavalry
with
guns
against
a
french
force
of
men
who
were
distributed
with
guns
over
a
front
of
some
thirty
miles
their
object
being
to
protect
both
amiens
and
rouen
when
bourbaki
was
summoned
to
the
loire
he
left
farre
as
chief
commander
in
the
north
with
faidherbe
and
lecointe
as
his
principal
lieutenants
there
was
bad
strategy
on
both
sides
but
la
fère
capitulated
to
the
germans
on
november
and
amiens
on
the
meantime
the
position
in
beleaguered
paris
was
becoming
very
bad
some
ten
thousand
men
either
of
the
regular
or
the
auxiliary
forces
were
laid
up
in
hospital
less
on
account
of
wounds
than
of
disease
charcoal
for
cooking
purposes
according
to
the
orthodox
french
system
was
being
strictly
rationed
on
november
only
a
certain
number
of
milch
cows
and
a
few
hundred
oxen
reserved
for
hospital
and
ambulance
patients
remained
of
all
the
bovine
live
stock
collected
together
before
the
siege
at
the
end
of
november
horses
were
being
slaughtered
every
day
on
the
other
hand
the
bread
allowance
had
been
raised
from
grammes
to
a
kilogramme
per
diem
and
a
great
deal
of
bread
was
given
to
the
horses
as
food
somewhat
uncertain
communications
had
been
opened
with
the
provinces
by
means
of
the
first
pigeon
to
bring
despatches
into
the
city
arriving
there
on
november
the
despatches
photographed
on
the
smallest
possible
scale
were
usually
enclosed
in
quills
fastened
under
one
or
another
of
the
birds
wings
each
balloon
that
left
the
city
now
took
with
it
a
certain
number
of
for
this
service
owing
however
to
the
bitter
cold
which
prevailed
that
winter
many
of
the
birds
perished
on
the
return
journey
and
thus
the
despatches
they
carried
did
not
reach
paris
whenever
any
such
communications
arrived
there
they
had
to
be
enlarged
by
means
of
a
contrivance
in
order
that
they
might
be
deciphered
meantime
the
aeronauts
leaving
the
city
conveyed
government
despatches
as
well
as
private
correspondence
and
in
this
wise
trochu
was
able
to
inform
gambetta
that
the

the

the

to
a
favourable
point
on

direct
between

the

the

skeleton

gambetta
immediately
replaced

by

of
the
many
naval
officers
who
were
now
with
the
french
armies
that
is
later
admiral
constant
jaurès
uncle
of
the
famous
socialist
leader
of
more
recent
times
jaurès
at
once
decided
to
retreat
on
le
mans
a
distance
of
rather
more
than
a
hundred
miles
and
this
was
effected
within
two
days
but
under
lamentable
circumstances
thousands
of
starving
men
deserted
and
others
were
only
kept
with
the
columns
by
the
employment
of
cavalry
and
the
threat
of
turning
the
artillery
upon
them
directly
gambetta
heard
of
the
state
of
affairs
he
hastened
to
le
mans
to
provide
for
the
defence
of
that
extremely
important
point
where
no
fewer
than
five
great
railway
lines
converged
those
of
paris
alençon
rennes
angers
and
tours
the
troops
commanded
by
jaurès
were
in
a
very
deplorable
condition
and
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
strengthen
them
it
so
happened
that
a
large
body
of
men
was
assembled
at
conlie
sixteen
or
seventeen
miles
away
they
formed
what
was
called
the
army
of
brittany
and
were
commanded
by
count
emile
de
kératry
the
son
of
a
distinguished
politician
and
literary
man
who
escaped
the
guillotine
during
the
reign
of
terror
the
count
himself
had
sat
in
the
legislative
body
of
the
second
empire
but
had
begun
life
as
a
soldier
serving
both
in
the
crimea
and
in
mexico
in
which
latter
country
he
had
acted
as
one
of
bazaine
orderly
officers
at
the
revolution
kératry
was
appointed
prefect
of
police
but
on
october
he
left
paris
by
balloon
being
entrusted
by
trochu
and
jules
favre
with
a
mission
to
prim
in
the
hope
that
he
might
secure
spanish
support
for
france
prim
and
his
colleagues
refused
to
intervene
however
and
kératry
then
hastened
to
tours
where
he
placed
himself
at
the
disposal
of
gambetta
with
whom
he
was
on
terms
of
close
friendship
it
was
arranged
between
them
that
kératry
should
gather
together
all
the
available
men
who
were
left
in
brittany
and
train
and
organize
them
for
which
purposes
a
camp
was
established
at
conlie
of
le
mans
conlie
was
the
first
place
which
i
decided
to
visit
on
quitting
saint
servan
the
most
appalling
rumours
were
current
throughout
brittany
respecting
the
new
camp
it
was
said
to
be
grossly
mismanaged
and
to
be
a
hotbed
of
disease
i
visited
it
collected
a
quantity
of
information
and
prepared
an
article
which
was
printed
by
the
and
attracted
considerable
attention
being
quoted
by
several
other
london
papers
and
taken
in
two
instances
as
the
text
for
leading
articles
so
far
as
the
camp
defences
and
the
arming
of
the
men
assembled
within
it
were
concerned
my
strictures
were
fully
justified
but
certain
official
documents
subsequently
published
indicate
that
i
was
in
error
on
some
points
the
whole
question
having
given
rise
to
a
good
deal
of
controversy
among
writers
on
the
war
some
of
them
regarding
conlie
as
a
flagrant
proof
of
gambetta
mismanagement
of
military
affairs
i
will
here
set
down
what
i
believe
to
be
strictly
the
truth
respecting
it
the
camp
was
established
near
the
site
of
an
old
roman
one
located
between
conlie
and
domfront
the
principal
part
occupying
some
rising
ground
in
the
centre
of
an
extensive
valley
it
was
intended
to
be
a
training
camp
rather
than
an
entrenched
and
fortified
one
though
a
redoubt
was
erected
on
the
south
and
some
works
were
begun
on
the
northern
and
the
sides
when
the
grand
duke
of
mecklenburg
reached
conlie
after
the
battle
of
le
mans
he
expressed
his
surprise
that
the
french
had
not
fortified
so
good
a
position
more
seriously
and
defended
it
with
vigour
both
the
railway
line
and
the
between
laval
and
le
mans
were
near
at
hand
and
only
a
few
miles
away
there
was
the
old
town
of
one
of
the
chief
grain
and
cattle
markets
of
the
region
there
was
considerable
in
the
vicinity
and
wood
was
abundant
but
there
was
no
watercourse
and
the
wells
of
the
various
adjacent
little
farms
yielded
but
a
very
inadequate
supply
of
water
for
a
camp
in
which
at
one
moment
some
men
were
assembled
thus
at
the
outset
the
camp
lacked
one
great
essential
and
such
was
the
case
when
i
visited
it
in
november
but
i
am
bound
to
add
that
a
source
was
soon
afterwards
found
in
the
very
centre
of
the
camp
and
tapped
so
successfully
by
means
of
a
arrangement
that
it
ended
by
yielding
over
litres
of
water
per
diem
the
critics
of
the
camp
have
said
that
the
spot
was
very
damp
and
muddy
and
therefore
necessarily
unhealthy
and
there
is
truth
in
that
assertion
but
the
same
might
be
remarked
of
all
the
camps
of
the
period
notably
that
of
de
paladines
in
front
of
orleans
moreover
when
a
week
snow
was
followed
by
a
fortnight
thaw
matters
could
scarcely
be
different
from
first
to
last
november
to
january
cases
of
illness
were
treated
in
the
five
ambulances
of
the
camp
among
them
were
cases
of
there
were
a
great
many
instances
of
bronchitis
and
kindred
affections
but
not
many
of
dysentery
among
the
cases
proved
fatal
i
find
on
referring
to
documents
of
the
period
that
on
november
the
day
before
gambetta
visited
the
camp
as
i
shall
presently
relate
the
total
effective
was
officers
with
men
by
december
although
a
marching
division
of
about
men
had
then
left
for
the
front
the
effective
had
risen
to
officers
with
about
men
the
rationing
of
the
men
cost
on
an
average
about
per
diem
there
were
guns
for
the
defence
of
the
camp
and
some
of
various
types
often
however
without
carriages
and
almost
invariably
without
teams
at
no
time
i
find
were
there
more
than
horses
and
fifty
mules
in
the
camp
there
was
also
a
great
scarcity
of
ammunition
for
the
guns
on
november
the
men
assembled
in
the
camp
had
between
them
the
following
firearms
and
ammunition
spencers
without
bayonets
chassepots
remingtons
snyders
muskets
of
various
types
revolvers
such
things
as
guns
firearms
cartridges
bayonets
and
so
forth
formed
the
subject
of
innumerable
telegrams
and
letters
exchanged
between
kératry
and
the
national
defence
delegation
at
tours
the
former
was
constantly
receiving
promises
from
gambetta
which
were
seldom
kept
supplies
at
first
intended
for
him
being
at
the
last
moment
sent
in
other
directions
according
to
the
more
pressing
requirements
of
the
hour
moreover
a
good
many
of
the
weapons
which
kératry
actually
received
were
defective
in
the
early
days
of
the
camp
many
of
the
men
were
given
staves
in
some
instances
for
use
at
drill
when
gambetta
arrived
at
le
mans
after
jaurès
had
retreated
thither
he
learnt
that
action
had
become
the
more
urgent
as
the
germans
were
steadily
prosecuting
their
advance
by
orders
of
the
grand
duke
of
mecklenburg
to
whose
army
these
forces
belonged
the
french
were
followed
to
la
and
whilst
one
german
column
then
went
west
towards
saint
cosme
another
advanced
southward
to
vibraye
thus
seriously
threatening
le
mans
such
was
the
position
on
november
fortunately
freycinet
was
able
to
send
jaurès
reinforcements
which
brought
his
effective
to
about
men
and
at
the
same
time
gambetta
urged
kératry
to
prepare
a
marching
division
of
the
men
at
conlie
early
on
the
gambetta
who
by
the
way
had
travelled
from
tours
to
le
mans
at
full
speed
on
a
railway
engine
visited
the
camp
and
expressed
his
approval
of
all
he
saw
there
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
muffled
in
his
fur
coat
and
looking
as
well
he
might
intensely
cold
his
orders
to
kératry
were
to
proceed
to
saint
calais
and
thence
to
the
forest
of
vibraye
so
as
to
cover
le
mans
on
the
east
it
took
fourteen
hours
and
trains
to
convey
the
marching
division
to
yvré
on
the
huisne
just
beyond
le
mans
the
effective
of
the
division
was
roughly
men
nearly
all
of
them
being
breton
mobilisés
the
artillery
consisted
of
one
battery
of
and
one
of
with
the
necessary
horses
two
batteries
of
dragged
by
naval
volunteers
and
several
gatling
guns
which
had
only
just
been
delivered
these
gatlings
which
at
that
time
were
absolutely
unknown
in
france
were
not
mounted
but
packed
in
sections
in
sealed
zinc
cases
which
were
opened
in
the
railway
vans
on
the
journey
the
guns
being
there
put
together
by
a
young
naval
officer
and
a
couple
of
civilian
engineers
a
little
later
the
artillery
of
the
force
was
augmented
after
these
troops
had
taken
up
position
at
yvré
in
order
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
crossing
the
huisne
various
conferences
were
held
between
gambetta
jaurès
and
kératry
general
le
bouëdec
had
been
left
in
command
at
conlie
and
general
trinité
had
been
selected
to
command
the
marching
division
of
the
bretons
from
the
very
outset
however
kératry
objected
to
the
plans
of
gambetta
and
jaurès
and
for
the
moment
the
duties
of
the
bretons
were
limited
to
participating
in
a
reconnaissance
on
a
somewhat
large
scale
two
columns
of
jaurès
forces
under
generals
colin
and
rousseau
joining
in
this
movement
which
was
directed
chiefly
on
bouloire
midway
between
le
mans
and
saint
calais
on
the
east
when
bouloire
was
reached
however
the
germans
who
had
momentarily
occupied
it
had
retired
and
the
french
thereupon
withdrew
to
their
former
positions
near
le
mans
then
came
trouble
gambetta
placed
kératry
under
the
orders
of
jaurès
and
kératry
would
not
accept
the
position
great
jealousy
prevailed
between
these
two
men
kératry
who
had
served
ten
years
in
the
french
army
claiming
that
he
knew
a
good
deal
more
about
military
matters
than
jaurès
who
as
i
previously
mentioned
had
hitherto
been
a
naval
officer
in
the
end
kératry
threw
up
his
command
le
bouëdec
succeeded
him
at
conlie
and
gougeard
afterwards
minister
of
marine
in
great
ministry
took
charge
of
the
bretons
at
yvré
where
he
exerted
himself
to
bring
them
to
a
higher
state
of
efficiency
i
must
now
refer
to
some
other
matters
trochu
had
informed
gambetta
of
his
intention
to
make
a
sortie
on
the
side
of
paris
the
plans
adopted
were
mainly
those
of
ducrot
who
took
chief
command
a
diversion
made
by
vinoy
to
the
south
of
the
city
on
november
gave
the
germans
an
inkling
of
what
was
intended
and
proved
a
fruitless
venture
which
cost
the
french
men
another
diversion
attempted
by
general
susbielle
on
november
led
to
a
similar
result
with
a
loss
of
men
ducrot
however
crossed
the
marne
and
very
desperate
fighting
ensued
at
champigny
and
neighbouring
localities
but
ducrot
force
less
than
men
was
insufficient
for
his
purpose
the
weather
moreover
was
extremely
cold
the
men
had
brought
with
them
neither
tents
nor
blankets
and
had
to
bivouac
without
fires
according
to
trochu
memoirs
there
was
also
an
insufficiency
of
ammunition
thus
the
champigny
sortie
failed
and
the
french
retired
to
their
former
lines
from
november
to
december
the
french
lost
men
and
the
germans
men
at
the
very
moment
when
the
army
of
paris
was
in
full
retreat
the
second
battle
of
orleans
was
beginning
gambetta
and
freyoinet
wished
to
advance
with
the
loire
army
in
order
to
meet
the
parisians
who
if
victorious
were
expected
to
march
on
fontainebleau
by
way
of
melun
in
the
latter
days
of
november
was
still
covering
orleans
on
the
north
with
the
and
army
corps
generals
martin
des
pallieres
and
chanzy
on
his
left
was
the
under
durrieu
who
a
few
days
later
was
succeeded
by
a
dashing
cavalry
officer
general
de
sonis
near
at
hand
also
there
was
the
army
corps
to
command
which
bourbaki
had
been
summoned
from
northern
france
his
place
being
taken
temporarily
by
young
general
billot
who
was
appointed
to
be
his
chief
of
staff
the
former
army
of
the
east
under
crouzat
this
had
now
become
the
army
corps
was
on
the
southern
side
of
the
loire
somewhere
between
gien
and
nevers
and
it
was
in
a
very
deplorable
condition
boots
were
wanted
for
men
tents
for
a
like
number
and
knapsacks
for
in
some
battalions
there
were
only
sufficient
knapsacks
for
a
quarter
of
the
men
the
others
carrying
their
clothes
provisions
and
cartridges
all
in
canvas
bags
i
once
heard
an
eyewitness
relate
that
many
of
crouzat
soldiers
marched
with
their
biscuits
four
days
supply
strung
together
like
chaplets
which
hung
from
their
necks
or
shoulders
the
germans
had
heard
of
the
removal
of
crouzat
force
to
the
loire
country
and
by
way
of
creating
a
diversion
the
grand
duke
of
mecklenburg
was
ordered
to
march
on
beaugenoy
southwest
of
orleans
meantime
gambetta
and
freyoinet
were
vainly
imploring
to
advance
he
made
all
sorts
of
excuses
at
one
moment
he
offered
to
consider
their
plans
not
to
comply
with
them
at
another
he
wished
to
wait
for
decisive
news
from
trochu
and
ducrot
finally
instead
of
the
five
army
corps
resolutely
advancing
in
the
direction
of
paris
it
was
resolved
just
to
open
the
way
with
the
billot
the
crouzat
and
some
detachments
of
the
martin
des
pallieres
the
result
was
the
sharp
battle
and
serious
defeat
of
november
when
the
corps
behaved
extremely
well
whilst
the
to
whose
deplorable
condition
i
have
just
referred
retreated
after
a
little
fighting
the
men
of
the
on
their
side
doing
little
or
nothing
at
all
in
this
engagement
the
french
whose
forces
ought
to
have
been
more
concentrated
lost
men
in
killed
and
wounded
and
who
were
taken
prisoners
the
german
loss
not
exceeding
men
four
days
later
december
came
the
very
serious
repulse
of
in
which
the
and
army
corps
were
engaged
the
french
then
lost
from
to
men
of
them
being
taken
prisoners
and
though
the
german
losses
exceeded
the
engagement
ended
by
quite
demoralising
army
under
those
conditions
came
the
battle
of
orleans
on
december
and
the
germans
now
being
under
the
chief
command
of
that
able
soldier
prince
frederick
charles
of
prussia
father
of
the
duchess
of
connaught
on
this
occasion
ordered
the
corps
engaged
at
loigny
to
retreat
on
his
entrenched
camp
the
and
could
not
cooperate
in
this
movement
however
and
on
the
three
others
being
driven
back
instructed
chanzy
to
retire
on
beaugency
and
marchenoir
but
sent
no
orders
to
bourbaki
who
was
now
on
the
scene
of
action
finally
the
chief
decided
to
abandon
his
entrenched
camp
the
troops
disbanded
and
scattered
and
orleans
was
evacuated
the
flight
being
so
precipitate
that
two
of
the
five
bridges
across
the
loire
were
left
intact
at
the
disposal
moreover
the
french
army
was
now
dislocated
bourbaki
with
the
and
des
pallières
with
the
corps
being
on
the
south
of
the
river
whilst
the
other
three
corps
were
on
the
northern
side
the
former
retired
in
the
direction
of
bourges
and
nevers
whilst
chanzy
who
was
now
placed
in
chief
command
of
the
others
being
removed
from
his
post
withdrew
gradually
towards
the
forest
of
marchenoir
in
that
second
battle
of
orleans
the
french
lost
men
but
of
them
were
taken
prisoners
on
their
side
the
germans
who
captured
guns
lost
fewer
than
men
for
three
days
december
to
chanzy
contested
the
german
advance
at
villorceau
but
on
december
blois
had
to
be
evacuated
and
the
army
withdrew
to
the
line
of
the
loir
in
the
neighbourhood
of
vendôme
meantime
at
the
very
moment
when
the
fate
of
orleans
was
being
sealed
orders
reached
jaurès
at
le
mans
to
advance
to
the
support
of
the
loire
army
i
was
lodging
at
an
inn
in
the
town
my
means
being
too
slender
to
enable
me
to
patronize
any
of
the
big
hotels
on
the
place
des
halles
which
moreover
were
crowded
with
officers
functionaries
and
so
forth
i
had
become
acquainted
with
some
of
the
officers
of
the
breton
division
under
gougeard
and
on
hearing
that
they
were
going
to
the
front
i
managed
to
obtain
from
colonel
bernard
gougeard
chief
of
staff
permission
to
accompany
the
column
with
one
of
the
ambulance
parties
now
and
again
during
the
advance
i
rode
in
one
of
the
vans
but
for
the
most
part
i
marched
with
the
men
this
moreover
being
the
preferable
course
as
the
weather
was
extremely
cold
even
had
i
possessed
the
means
and
at
most
i
had
about
in
my
pocket
i
could
not
have
bought
a
horse
at
le
mans
i
was
stoutly
clad
having
a
very
warm
overcoat
of
grey
irish
frieze
with
good
boots
and
a
pair
of
gaiters
made
for
me
by
nicholas
the
saint
malo
bootmaker
younger
brother
so
he
himself
asserted
of
niccolini
the
tenor
sometime
husband
of
mme
patti
there
were
from
to
men
in
our
force
which
now
ranked
as
the
fourth
division
of
the
army
corps
nearly
all
the
men
of
both
brigades
were
breton
mobilisés
adjoined
to
whom
however
perhaps
for
the
purpose
of
steadying
them
were
three
or
four
very
small
detachments
of
former
regiments
of
the
line
there
was
also
a
small
contingent
of
the
french
foreign
legion
which
had
been
brought
from
algeria
starting
from
yvré
towards
noon
on
december
we
marched
to
ardenay
where
we
spent
the
night
the
weather
was
fine
and
dry
but
intensely
cold
on
the
we
camped
on
some
hills
near
the
town
of
saint
calais
moved
only
a
mile
or
two
farther
on
the
there
being
a
delay
in
the
receipt
of
certain
orders
then
at
seven
on
the
started
in
the
direction
of
vendôme
marching
for
about
twelve
hours
with
only
the
briefest
halts
we
passed
from
the
department
of
the
sarthe
into
that
of
going
on
until
we
reached
a
little
place
called
where
we
spent
the
night
under
uncomfortable
conditions
for
it
snowed
early
the
following
day
we
set
out
again
and
leaving
vendôme
a
couple
of
miles
or
so
away
on
our
right
we
passed
fréteval
and
camped
on
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
of
marchenoir
the
night
proved
bitterly
cold
the
temperature
being
some
fourteen
degrees
centigrade
below
i
slept
huddled
up
in
a
van
but
the
men
generally
were
under
canvas
and
there
was
very
little
straw
for
them
to
lie
upon
in
such
wise
that
in
the
morning
some
of
them
actually
found
their
garments
to
the
ground
throughout
the
night
of
the
we
heard
guns
booming
in
the
distance
on
the
the
and
the
december
we
were
continually
marching
always
going
in
the
direction
of
the
guns
we
went
from
ecoman
to
morée
to
saint
and
thence
to
the
chateau
de
rougemont
near
fréteval
a
spot
famous
as
the
scene
of
a
victory
gained
by
our
richard
over
philip
augustus
the
more
or
less
distant
artillery
fire
was
incessant
both
by
day
and
by
night
but
we
were
only
supporting
other
divisions
of
the
corps
and
did
not
find
ourselves
actually
engaged
on
the
however
there
was
very
sharp
fighting
both
at
fréteval
and
morée
and
on
the
morning
of
the
our
gatlings
went
forward
to
support
the
second
division
of
our
army
corps
which
was
being
hard
pressed
by
the
germans
all
at
once
however
orders
for
a
general
retreat
arrived
chanzy
having
at
last
decided
to
fall
back
on
le
mans
there
was
considerable
confusion
but
at
last
our
men
set
out
taking
a
direction
fairly
good
order
prevailed
on
the
road
and
the
wiry
little
bretons
at
least
proved
that
their
marching
powers
were
unimpaired
we
went
on
incessantly
though
slowly
during
the
night
and
did
not
make
a
real
halt
until
about
seven
on
the
following
morning
when
almost
we
reached
a
little
town
called
droué
jaurès
i
should
mention
had
received
the
order
to
retreat
at
about
four
on
the
afternoon
of
december
and
had
speedily
selected
three
different
routes
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
army
corps
our
division
however
was
the
last
to
quit
its
positions
it
being
about
eight
at
night
when
we
set
out
thus
our
march
lasted
nine
hours
the
country
was
a
succession
of
sinuous
valleys
and
stiff
slopes
and
banks
often
overlooked
the
roads
which
were
edged
with
oaks
and
bushes
there
were
several
streams
a
few
woods
and
a
good
many
little
copses
farms
often
lay
close
together
and
now
and
again
attempts
were
made
to
buy
food
and
drink
of
the
peasantry
who
upon
hearing
our
approach
came
at
times
with
lights
to
their
thresholds
but
they
were
a
breed
and
demanded
exorbitant
prices
half
a
franc
was
the
lowest
charge
for
a
piece
of
bread
considering
how
bad
the
men
boots
were
the
marching
was
very
good
but
a
number
of
men
deserted
under
cover
of
the
night
generally
speaking
though
there
was
a
slight
skirmish
at
cloyes
and
an
engagement
at
droué
as
i
shall
presently
relate
the
retreat
was
not
greatly
hampered
by
the
enemy
in
point
of
fact
as
the
revelations
of
more
recent
years
have
shown
moltke
was
more
anxious
about
the
forces
of
bourbaki
than
about
those
of
chanzy
and
both
prince
frederick
charles
and
the
grand
duke
of
mecklenburg
had
instructions
to
keep
a
strict
watch
on
the
movements
of
bourbaki
corps
nevertheless
some
of
the
grand
troops
notably
a
body
of
cavalry
attempted
to
cut
off
our
retreat
when
however
late
on
the
some
of
our
men
came
in
contact
with
a
detachment
of
the
enemy
near
cloyes
they
momentarily
checked
its
progress
and
as
i
have
indicated
we
succeeded
in
reaching
droué
without
loss
that
morning
the
the
weather
was
again
very
cold
a
fog
following
the
rain
and
sleet
of
the
previous
days
somewhat
later
however
snow
began
to
fall
at
droué
a
little
place
of
about
a
thousand
inhabitants
with
a
ruined
castle
and
an
ancient
church
we
breakfasted
as
best
we
could
about
nine
came
marching
orders
and
an
hour
later
when
a
large
number
of
our
men
were
already
on
their
way
towards
saint
agil
our
next
general
gougeard
mounted
and
prepared
to
go
off
with
his
staff
immediately
in
advance
of
our
at
that
precise
moment
however
we
were
attacked
by
the
germans
whose
presence
near
us
we
had
not
suspected
it
was
however
certainly
known
to
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
droué
who
terrified
by
all
that
they
had
heard
of
the
harshness
shown
by
the
germans
towards
the
localities
where
they
encountered
any
resistance
shrank
from
informing
either
gougeard
or
any
of
his
officers
that
the
enemy
was
at
hand
the
artillery
with
which
our
rear
was
to
be
protected
was
at
this
moment
on
the
little
square
of
droué
it
consisted
of
a
mountain
battery
under
gouesse
of
the
artillery
and
three
gatlings
under
de
la
forte
of
the
navy
with
naval
lieutenant
rodellec
du
porzic
in
chief
command
whilst
it
was
being
brought
into
position
colonel
bernard
gougeard
chief
of
staff
galloped
off
to
stop
the
retreat
of
the
other
part
of
our
column
the
enemy
force
consisted
of
detachments
of
cavalry
artillery
and
landwehr
infantry
before
our
little
guns
could
be
trained
on
them
the
landwehr
men
had
already
seized
several
outlying
houses
barns
and
sheds
whence
they
strove
to
pick
off
our
gutiners
for
a
moment
our
mobilisés
hesitated
to
go
forward
but
gougeard
dashed
amongst
them
appealed
to
their
courage
and
then
led
them
against
the
enemy
not
more
than
three
hundred
yards
separated
the
bulk
of
the
contending
forces
indeed
there
were
some
germans
in
the
houses
less
than
two
hundred
yards
away
our
men
at
last
forced
these
fellows
to
decamp
killing
and
wounding
several
of
them
whilst
thanks
to
colonel
bernard
prompt
intervention
a
battalion
of
the
line
regiment
and
two
companies
of
the
foreign
legion
whose
retreat
was
hastily
stopped
threatened
the
enemy
right
flank
a
squadron
of
the
second
lancers
under
a
young
lieutenant
also
came
to
our
help
dismounting
and
supporting
mobilises
with
the
carbines
they
carried
realizing
that
we
were
in
force
the
enemy
ended
by
retreating
but
not
until
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
fighting
in
and
around
the
outlying
houses
of
droué
such
briefly
was
the
first
action
i
ever
witnessed
like
others
i
was
under
fire
for
some
time
being
near
the
guns
and
helping
to
carry
away
the
gunners
whom
the
germans
shot
from
the
windows
of
the
houses
in
which
they
had
installed
themselves
we
lost
four
or
five
artillerymen
in
that
manner
including
the
chief
officer
de
rodelleo
du
porzic
whom
a
bullet
struck
in
the
chest
he
passed
away
in
a
little
café
whither
we
carried
him
he
was
i
believe
the
last
of
his
family
two
of
his
brothers
having
previously
been
killed
in
action
we
lost
four
or
five
other
officers
in
this
same
engagement
as
well
as
a
breton
chaplain
of
the
mobilisés
our
total
losses
were
certainly
larger
than
gougeard
subsequently
stated
in
his
official
report
amounting
in
killed
and
wounded
i
think
to
from
to
men
though
the
officers
as
a
rule
behaved
extremely
well
some
of
them
indeed
splendidly
there
were
a
few
lamentable
instances
of
cowardice
by
gougeard
orders
four
were
placed
under
arrest
and
at
the
end
of
the
retreat
of
these
two
were
acquitted
whilst
a
third
was
shot
and
a
fourth
sentenced
to
two
years
imprisonment
in
a
fortress
from
the
formation
of
the
army
of
brittany
until
the
armistice
the
total
number
of
executions
was
eleven
they
included
one
officer
mentioned
above
for
cowardice
in
presence
of
the
enemy
five
men
of
the
foreign
legion
for
murdering
peasants
one
for
armed
robbery
and
four
men
line
and
mobile
guards
for
desertion
in
presence
of
the
enemy
the
number
would
have
been
larger
had
it
been
possible
to
identify
and
punish
those
who
were
most
guilty
in
the
stampede
of
la
tuilerie
during
the
battle
of
le
mans
the
enemy
pursuit
having
been
checked
we
eventually
quitted
droué
but
when
we
had
gone
another
three
miles
or
so
and
reached
a
village
called
fontenelle
the
germans
came
on
again
it
was
then
about
two
in
the
afternoon
and
for
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
whilst
we
continued
our
retreat
the
enemy
kept
up
a
running
cannonade
repeatedly
endeavouring
to
harass
our
rear
we
constantly
replied
to
their
fire
however
and
steadily
kept
them
off
losing
only
a
few
men
before
the
dusk
fell
when
the
pursuit
ceased
we
afterwards
plodded
on
slowly
the
roads
being
in
a
terrible
condition
until
at
about
six
we
reached
the
village
of
saint
agil
where
the
staff
installed
itself
at
count
de
stately
renaissance
château
the
weather
was
better
on
december
for
though
it
was
extremely
cold
the
snow
ceased
falling
but
we
still
had
a
formidable
task
before
us
the
roads
as
i
have
said
were
wretched
and
at
saint
agil
we
had
to
contend
with
some
terrible
quagmires
across
which
we
found
it
at
first
impossible
to
get
our
guns
and
baggage
train
it
became
necessary
to
lop
and
fell
trees
and
form
with
them
a
kind
of
bed
over
which
our
impedimenta
might
travel
hour
after
hour
went
by
amidst
incessant
labour
an
ammunition
waggon
containing
only
half
its
proper
load
required
the
efforts
of
a
dozen
horses
to
pull
it
over
that
morass
whilst
as
for
the
guns
each
of
the
required
even
more
horses
it
was
three
on
the
afternoon
of
the
when
the
last
gun
was
got
across
three
were
broken
during
those
efforts
but
our
men
managed
to
save
the
pieces
late
in
the
operations
the
germans
again
put
in
an
appearance
but
were
held
in
respect
by
our
gatlings
and
half
an
hour
however
after
our
departure
from
saint
agil
they
entered
the
village
in
a
very
wretched
condition
and
footsore
we
went
on
through
the
sudden
thaw
which
had
set
in
towards
vibraye
whose
forest
full
in
those
days
of
wild
boars
and
deer
stretched
away
on
our
left
we
were
now
in
the
department
of
the
sarthe
and
cutting
across
country
in
the
direction
of
the
huisne
we
at
last
reached
the
ancient
little
of
connerré
on
the
running
left
of
the
river
towards
le
mans
there
i
took
leave
of
our
column
and
after
buying
a
shirt
and
some
socks
hastened
to
the
railway
station
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
hoping
from
what
was
told
me
that
there
might
be
some
means
of
getting
to
le
mans
by
train
instead
of
accompanying
our
men
along
the
highway
at
connerré
station
i
found
a
very
good
inn
where
i
at
once
partook
of
the
best
meal
that
i
had
eaten
since
leaving
le
mans
sixteen
days
previously
i
then
washed
put
on
my
new
shirt
and
socks
and
went
to
interview
the
after
a
great
deal
of
trouble
as
i
had
a
permit
signed
by
colonel
bernard
and
wore
an
ambulance
armlet
i
was
allowed
to
travel
to
le
mans
in
a
railway
van
there
was
no
regular
service
of
trains
the
only
ones
now
running
so
far
north
being
used
for
military
purposes
i
got
to
le
mans
a
few
hours
before
our
column
reached
yvré
on
the
night
of
december
and
at
once
sought
a
train
which
would
convey
me
to
rennes
if
not
as
far
as
saint
malo
then
came
another
long
slow
dreary
journey
in
a
villainous
carriage
it
was
between
ten
and
eleven
in
the
morning
when
we
reached
rennes
i
still
had
about
francs
in
my
pocket
and
knowing
that
it
would
not
cost
me
more
than
a
quarter
of
that
amount
to
get
to
saint
malo
i
resolved
to
indulge
in
a
good
at
the
hôtel
de
france
there
was
nobody
excepting
a
few
waiters
in
the
long
but
the
tables
were
already
laid
there
when
however
i
seated
myself
at
one
of
them
the
came
up
declaring
that
i
could
not
be
accommodated
as
the
tables
were
reserved
for
i
was
inquiring
who
might
be
when
some
of
them
entered
the
room
in
a
very
swaggering
manner
all
were
arrayed
in
stylish
and
uniforms
with
beautiful
boots
and
looked
in
the
pink
of
condition
they
belonged
i
found
to
a
free
corps
called
the
eclaireurs
and
their
principal
occupations
were
to
mess
together
copiously
and
then
stroll
about
the
town
ogling
all
the
girls
they
met
the
corps
never
went
to
the
front
three
or
four
weeks
afterwards
when
i
again
passed
through
rennes
this
second
time
with
my
father
messieurs
les
eclaireurs
were
still
displaying
their
immaculate
uniforms
and
highly
polished
boots
amidst
all
the
misery
exhibited
by
the
remnants
of
one
of
chanzy
though
i
was
little
more
than
a
boy
my
blood
fairly
boiled
when
i
was
requested
to
give
up
my
seat
at
table
for
these
arrogant
young
fops
i
went
to
complain
at
the
hotel
but
being
confronted
there
by
the
landlady
instead
of
by
the
landlord
i
did
not
express
my
feelings
so
strongly
as
i
might
have
done
madame
sweetly
informed
me
that
the
first
was
entirely
reserved
for
messieurs
les
eclaireurs
but
that
if
i
would
wait
till
the
second
at
noon
i
should
find
ample
accommodation
however
i
was
not
inclined
to
do
any
such
thing
i
thought
of
all
the
poor
famished
shivering
men
whom
i
had
left
less
than
hours
previously
and
some
of
whom
i
had
more
than
once
helped
to
buy
bread
and
cheese
and
wine
during
our
long
and
painful
marches
they
at
all
events
had
done
their
duty
as
best
they
could
and
i
felt
highly
indignant
with
the
swaggering
young
bloods
of
rennes
who
were
content
to
remain
in
their
native
town
displaying
their
uniforms
and
enjoying
themselves
fortunately
such
instances
were
very
rare
returning
to
the
railway
station
i
obtained
something
to
eat
at
the
where
i
presently
heard
somebody
trying
to
make
a
waiter
understand
an
order
given
in
broken
french
recognizing
a
i
intervened
and
procured
what
he
desired
i
found
that
he
was
going
to
saint
malo
like
myself
so
we
made
the
journey
together
he
told
me
that
although
he
spoke
very
little
french
he
had
come
to
france
on
behalf
of
an
english
firm
in
order
to
get
a
contract
from
some
of
the
military
authorities
many
such
people
were
to
be
found
in
brittany
at
le
mans
at
tours
and
elsewhere
during
the
latter
period
of
the
war
an
uncle
of
mine
frederick
vizetelly
came
over
i
remember
and
interviewed
freyeinet
and
others
on
behalf
of
an
english
firm
i
forget
whether
he
secured
a
contract
or
not
but
it
is
a
lamentable
and
uncontrovertible
fact
that
many
of
the
weapons
and
many
of
the
boots
sold
by
english
makers
to
the
national
defence
were
extremely
defective
some
of
the
american
weapons
were
even
worse
than
ours
as
for
the
boots
they
often
had
mere
composition
soles
which
were
soon
worn
out
i
saw
notably
after
the
battle
of
le
mans
hundreds
i
believe
i
might
say
without
exaggeration
thousands
of
men
whose
boots
were
mere
remnants
some
hobbled
through
the
snow
with
only
rags
wrapped
round
their
bleeding
feet
on
the
other
hand
a
few
of
our
firms
undoubtedly
supplied
satisfactory
boots
and
it
may
have
been
so
in
the
case
of
the
traveller
whom
i
met
at
rennes
a
few
days
after
my
return
to
saint
malo
my
cousin
montague
vizetelly
arrived
there
with
a
commission
from
the
to
join
forces
at
le
mans
robinson
i
was
afterwards
told
had
put
some
questions
about
me
to
my
brother
adrian
and
on
hearing
how
young
i
was
had
thought
that
i
might
not
be
equal
to
the
occasion
if
a
decisive
battle
between
prince
frederick
charles
and
chanzy
should
be
fought
my
cousin
then
years
of
age
was
accordingly
sent
over
from
that
time
nearly
all
my
war
letters
were
forwarded
to
the
mall
and
as
it
happened
one
of
them
was
the
first
account
of
the
great
battle
of
le
mans
from
the
french
side

appear

that
on

the
germans
for
the
first
time
reached
the
since
december
faidherbe
had
taken
the
chief
command
of
the
army
of
the
north
at
lille
he
was
distinctly
a
clever
general
and
was
at
that
time
only
years
of
age
but
he
had
spent
eleven
years
in
senegal
organizing
and
developing
that
colony
and
his
health
had
been
impaired
by
the
tropical
west
african
climate
nevertheless
he
evinced
no
little
energy
and
never
despaired
however
slender
might
be
the
forces
under
him
and
however
cramped
his
position
as
soon
as
he
had
reorganized
the
army
entrusted
to
his
charge
he
moved
towards
amiens
and
on
december
and
a
battle
was
fought
at
in
the
vicinity
of
that
town
in
some
respects
faidherbe
gained
the
advantage
but
his
success
was
a
barren
one
and
his
losses
were
far
greater
than
those
of
the
germans
amounting
indeed
to
men
apart
from
many
deserters
whereas
the
enemy
were
not
more
than
a
thousand
gambetta
however
telegraphed
to
the
prefects
that
a
great
victory
had
been
gained
and
i
remember
that
when
a
notice
to
that
effect
was
posted
at
the
of
saint
servan
everybody
there
became
jubilant
most
of
our
or
at
least
the
earliest
intelligence
of
any
important
engagement
came
to
us
in
the
fashion
i
have
indicated
townsfolk
constantly
assembling
outside
the
prefectures
subprefectures
and
municipal
buildings
in
order
to
read
the
day
news
at
times
it
was
entirely
false
at
others
some
slight
success
of
the
french
arms
was
magnified
into
a
victory
and
a
petty
engagement
became
a
pitched
battle
the
news
in
the
french
newspapers
was
usually
very
belated
and
often
quite
unreliable
though
now
and
again
telegrams
from
london
were
published
giving
information
which
was
as
near
to
the
truth
as
the
many
english
war
correspondents
on
both
sides
could
ascertain
after
the
war
both
frenchmen
and
germans
admitted
to
me
that
of
all
the
newspaper
intelligence
of
the
period
there
was
nothing
approaching
in
accuracy
that
which
was
imparted
by
our
british
correspondents
i
am
convinced
from
all
i
heard
in
paris
in
berlin
in
vienna
and
elsewhere
during
the
two
or
three
years
which
followed
the
war
that
the
reputation
of
the
british
press
was
greatly
enhanced
on
the
continent
by
the
news
it
gave
during
the
campaign
many
a
time
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
years
did
i
hear
foreigners
inquire
what
do
the
london
papers
say
or
remark
if
an
english
paper
says
it
it
must
be
true
i
do
not
wish
to
blow
the
trumpet
too
loudly
on
behalf
of
the
profession
to
which
i
belonged
for
many
years
but
what
i
have
here
mentioned
is
strictly
true
and
now
that
my
days
of
travel
are
over
i
should
be
glad
to
know
that
foreigners
still
hold
the
british
press
in
the
same
high
esteem
but
to
return
to
my
narrative
whilst
the
events
i
have
mentioned
were
taking
place
in
normandy
and
northern
france
gambetta
was
vainly
trying
to
persuade
bourbaki
to
advance
in
the
direction
of
montargis
he
also
wished
to
reinforce
garibaldi
but
the
enmity
of
many
french
officers
towards
the
italian
liberator
was
so
great
that
they
would
not
serve
with
him
general
von
werder
was
at
this
time
covering
the
siege
of
belfort
and
watching
langres
on
december
there
was
an
engagement
at
nuits
between
some
of
his
forces
and
those
led
by
the
french
commander
cremer
who
claimed
the
victory
but
afterwards
retreated
towards
beaune
the
french
however
were
now
able
to
dijon
on
the
another
sortie
was
made
from
paris
this
time
on
the
north
in
the
direction
of
le
bourget
and
ducrot
was
again
in
command
and
men
were
got
together
but
only
were
brought
into
action
there
were
a
great
many
desertions
and
no
fewer
than
six
officers
of
one
brigade
alone
were
and
punished
for
lack
of
courage
the
affair
appears
to
have
been
arranged
in
order
to
quiet
the
more
reckless
elements
in
paris
who
were
for
ever
demanding
a
great
a
torrential
sortie
in
this
instance
however
there
was
merely
much
ado
about
nothing
the
truth
is
that
ever
since
the
champigny
affair
both
trochu
and
ducrot
had
lost
all
confidence
on
january
and
the
french
under
faidherbe
and
the
germans
under
goeben
fought
a
battle
at
bapaume
south
of
arras
the
former
were
by
far
the
more
numerous
force
being
indeed
as
three
to
one
and
faidherbe
is
credited
with
having
gained
a
victory
but
again
it
was
only
a
barren
one
for
although
the
germans
fell
back
the
french
found
it
quite
as
necessary
to
do
the
same
about
a
week
previously
the
french
army
corps
with
which
bourbaki
had
done
little
or
nothing
on
the
loire
had
been
removed
from
vierzon
and
bourges
to
join
the
army
of
the
east
of
which
bourbaki
now
assumed
the
chief
command
the
transport
of
the
troops
proved
a
very
difficult
affair
and
there
was
great
disorder
and
again
many
desertions
nevertheless
on
january
bourbaki
fought
werder
at
villersexel
in
the
vicinity
of
vesoul
montbéliard
and
belfort
in
this
engagement
there
appear
to
have
been
serious
mistakes
on
both
sides
and
though
bourbaki
claimed
a
success
his
losses
were
numerically
double
those
of
the
germans
meantime
chanzy
at
le
mans
was
urging
all
sorts
of
plans
on
gambetta
and
freyeinet
in
the
first
place
he
desired
to
recruit
and
strengthen
his
forces
so
sorely
tried
by
their
difficult
retreat
and
in
order
that
he
might
have
time
to
do
so
he
wished
bourbaki
to
execute
a
powerful
diversion
by
marching
in
the
direction
of
troyes
but
gambetta
and
freyeinet
had
decided
otherwise
bourbaki
advance
was
to
be
towards
the
vosges
after
which
he
was
to
turn
westward
and
march
on
paris
with
men
chanzy
was
informed
of
this
decision
on
and
about
january
and
on
the
he
made
a
last
attempt
to
modify
the
government
plan
in
order
that
bourbaki
march
might
be
directed
on
a
point
nearer
to
paris
in
reply
he
was
informed
that
it
was
too
late
to
modify
the
arrangements
with
regard
to
his
own
operations
chanzy
idea
was
to
march
towards
the
capital
when
his
forces
were
reorganized
his
bases
were
to
be
the
river
sarthe
the
town
of
le
mans
and
the
running
northward
to
alençon
thence
he
proposed
to
advance
to
some
point
on
the
river
eure
between
dreux
and
chartres
going
afterwards
towards
paris
by
such
a
route
as
circumstances
might
allow
he
had
men
near
le
mans
and
proposed
to
take
with
or
and
calculated
that
he
might
require
a
week
or
to
be
precise
eight
days
to
carry
this
force
from
le
mans
to
chartres
allowing
for
fighting
on
the
way
further
to
assist
his
movements
he
wished
faidherbe
as
well
as
bourbaki
to
assume
the
offensive
vigorously
as
soon
as
he
was
ready
the
carrying
out
of
the
scheme
was
frustrated
however
in
part
by
the
movements
which
the
government
ordered
bourbaki
to
execute
and
in
part
by
what
may
be
called
the
sudden
awakening
of
prince
frederick
charles
who
feeling
more
apprehensive
respecting
bourbaki
movements
had
hitherto
in
a
measure
neglected
chanzy
doings
on
december
captain
afterwards
general
de
boisdeffre
he
was
chief
of
the
french
staff
during
the
famous
dreyfus
case
in
which
his
name
was
frequently
mentioned
reached
le
mans
after
quitting
paris
in
one
of
the
balloons
and
gave
chanzy
certain
messages
with
which
trochu
had
entrusted
him
he
brought
nothing
in
writing
as
what
he
had
to
communicate
was
considered
too
serious
to
be
committed
to
paper
yet
both
my
father
and
myself
could
have
imparted
virtually
the
same
information
which
was
but
a
de
it
concerned
the
date
when
the
fall
of
paris
would
become
inevitable
we
my
father
and
myself
had
said
repeatedly
at
versailles
and
elsewhere
that
the
capital
supply
of
food
would
last
until
the
latter
days
of
january
and
that
the
city
unless
in
the
meanwhile
it
were
relieved
must
then
surrender
authentic
information
to
that
effect
was
available
in
paris
before
we
quitted
it
in
november
of
course
trochu
message
to
chanzy
was
official
and
carried
greater
weight
than
the
assertions
of
journalists
it
was
to
the
effect
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
negotiate
a
capitulation
on
january
in
order
to
give
time
for
the
revictualling
of
the
city
two
million
inhabitants
as
it
happened
the
resistance
was
prolonged
for
another
week
or
so
however
boisdeffre
information
was
sufficiently
explicit
to
show
chanzy
that
no
time
must
be
lost
if
paris
was
to
be
saved
some
german
cavalry
probably
the
same
men
who
had
pursued
column
showed
themselves
at
saint
calais
which
is
only
some
thirty
miles
of
le
mans
as
early
as
december
but
soon
retired
and
no
further
advance
of
the
enemy
in
that
direction
took
place
for
several
days
chanzy
formed
two
flying
columns
one
a
division
under
general
jouffroy
and
one
a
body
of
men
under
general
rousseau
for
the
purpose
of
worrying
the
enemy
and
keeping
him
at
a
distance
these
troops
particularly
those
of
jouffroy
who
moved
towards
montoire
and
vendôme
had
several
small
but
none
the
less
important
engagements
with
the
germans
prince
frederick
charles
indeed
realised
that
operations
were
designed
to
ensure
the
security
of
chanzy
main
army
whilst
it
was
being
recruited
and
reorganized
and
thereupon
decided
to
march
on
le
mans
and
attack
chanzy
before
the
latter
had
attained
his
object
on
christmas
day
a
force
of
german
cavalry
artillery
and
infantry
descended
upon
saint
calais
then
a
town
of
about
inhabitants
levied
a
sum
of
francs
pillaged
several
of
the
houses
and
a
number
of
the
townsfolk
when
some
of
the
latter
ventured
to
protest
pointing
out
among
other
things
that
after
various
little
engagements
in
the
vicinity
several
wounded
germans
had
been
brought
into
the
town
and
well
cared
for
there
the
enemy
commanding
officer
called
them
a
pack
of
cowards
and
flung
them
francs
of
his
recent
levy
to
pay
them
he
said
for
their
services
the
affair
was
reported
to
chanzy
who
thereupon
wrote
an
indignant
letter
to
the
german
general
commanding
at
vendôme
it
was
carried
thither
by
a
certain
de
vézian
a
civil
engineer
attached
to
chanzy
staff
who
brought
back
the
following
reply
reçu
une
lettre
du
général
chanzy
un
général
prussien
ne
sachant
pas
écrire
une
lettre
de
tel
genre
ne
saurait
y
faire
une
réponse
par
écrit
au
à
vendôme
décembre
signature
it
was
perhaps
a
pity
that
chanzy
ever
wrote
his
letter
of
protest
french
generals
were
too
much
given
to
expressing
their
feelings
in
writing
daring
that
war
deeds
and
not
words
were
wanted
meantime
the
army
was
being
slowly
recruited
on
december
gambetta
had
issued
none
too
soon
a
decree
authorising
the
billeting
of
the
men
during
the
winter
campaign
nevertheless
when
gougeard
troops
returned
to
yvreé
they
were
ordered
to
sleep
under
canvas
like
many
other
divisions
of
the
army
it
was
a
great
mistake
in
that
severe
weather
the
winter
was
one
of
the
coldest
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
men
sufferings
were
very
great
they
were
in
need
too
of
many
things
new
shoes
linen
and
other
garments
and
there
was
much
delay
in
providing
for
their
more
urgent
requirements
thus
the
number
of
desertions
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
the
did
his
best
to
ensure
discipline
among
his
dispirited
troops
several
men
were
shot
by
way
of
example
when
shortly
before
the
battle
of
le
mans
the
army
corps
crossed
the
huisne
to
take
up
positions
near
montfort
several
officers
were
severely
punished
for
riding
in
ambulance
and
baggage
waggons
instead
of
marching
with
their
men
le
mans
is
not
easily
defended
from
an
enemy
advancing
upon
it
from
eastern
and
directions
a
close
defence
is
impossible
by
reason
of
the
character
of
the
country
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
the
town
was
one
of
about
inhabitants
very
ancient
already
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
romans
it
became
the
capital
of
maine
william
the
conqueror
seized
it
but
it
was
snatched
from
his
son
robert
by
hélie
de
la
flêche
later
geoffrey
the
first
of
the
plantagenets
was
buried
there
it
being
moreover
the
birthplace
of
his
son
our
henry
ii
in
after
years
it
was
taken
from
richard
by
who
assigned
it
however
to
richard
widow
queen
berengaria
a
house
in
the
town
is
wrongly
said
to
have
been
her
residence
but
she
undoubtedly
founded
the
abbaye
de
near
yvré
and
was
buried
there
it
was
at
le
mans
that
king
john
of
france
who
surrendered
to
the
black
prince
at
poitiers
was
born
and
in
the
neighbouring
forest
john
grandson
charles

first
gave
signs
of
insanity
five
times
during
the
wars
of
the
days
of
henry
v
and
henry
vi
le
mans
was
besieged
by
one
or
another
of
the
contending
parties
the
town
again
suffered
during
the
huguenot
wars
and
yet
again
during
the
revolution
when
the
vendéens
seized
it
but
were
expelled
by
marceau
some
of
them
being
bayoneted
on
the
place
de
rich
in
associations
with
the
history
of
england
as
well
as
that
of
france
le
mans
in
spite
of
its
accessibility
for
railway
lines
coming
from
five
different
directions
meet
there
is
seldom
visited
by
our
tourists
its
glory
is
its
cathedral
strangely
neglected
by
the
numerous
english
writers
on
the
cathedrals
of
france
here
are
exemplified
the
architectural
styles
of
five
successive
centuries
and
as
mérimée
once
wrote
in
passing
from
one
part
of
the
edifice
to
another
it
is
as
if
you
passed
from
one
to
another
religion
but
the
supreme
features
of
the
cathedral
are
its
windows
which
include
some
of
the
very
oldest
in
the
world
many
years
ago
when
they
were
in
a
more
perfect
condition
than
they
are
now
hucher
gave
reproductions
of
them
in
a
rare
folio
volume
here
too
is
the
tomb
of
queen
berengaria
of
england
removed
from
the
abbaye
de
here
also
was
formerly
that
of
her
husband
grandfather
geoffrey
plantagenet
but
this
was
destroyed
by
the
huguenots
and
you
must
go
to
the
museum
to
see
all
that
remains
of
it
that
is
the
priceless
enamel
by
which
it
was
formerly
surmounted
and
which
represents
geoffrey
grasping
his
sword
and
his
azure
shield
the
latter
bearing
a
cross
and
lions
rampant
not
the
leoparded
lions
passant
of
his
english
descendants
much
ink
has
flowed
respecting
that
shield
during
squabbles
among
heraldists
judging
by
recent
plans
of
le
mans
a
good
many
changes
have
taken
place
there
since
the
time
of
the
war
various
new
broad
straight
streets
have
been
substituted
for
some
of
the
quaint
old
winding
ones
the
pont
napoléon
now
appears
to
have
become
the
pont
gambetta
and
the
place
des
minimes
is
called
the
place
de
la
république
i
notice
also
a
rue
thiers
which
did
not
exist
in
the
days
when
le
mans
was
familiar
to
me
as
an
town
in
this
narrative
i
must
of
course
take
it
as
it
was
then
not
as
it
is
now
the
sarthe
flowing
from
north
to
south
where
it
is
joined
by
its
tributary
the
huisne
coming
from
the
still
divides
the
town
into
two
unequal
sections
the
larger
one
on
the
most
elevated
part
of
which
stands
the
cathedral
being
that
on
the
river
left
bank
at
the
time
i
write
of
the
sarthe
was
spanned
by
three
stone
bridges
a
suspension
bridge
and
a
granite
and
marble
railway
viaduct
some
feet
in
length
the
german
advance
was
bound
to
come
from
the
east
and
the
south
on
the
east
is
a
series
of
heights
below
which
flow
the
waters
of
the
huisne
the
views
range
over
an
expanse
of
varying
elevation
steep
hills
and
deep
valleys
being
frequent
there
are
numerous
watercourses
the
huisne
which
helps
to
feed
the
sarthe
is
itself
fed
by
a
number
of
little
tributaries
the
lowest
ground
at
the
time
i
have
in
mind
was
generally
intersected
here
and
there
with
rows
of
poplars
whilst
the
higher
ground
was
employed
for
the
cultivation
of
crops
every
little
field
was
circumscribed
by
ditches
banks
and
thick
hedges
the
loftiest
point
of
the
eastern
heights
is
at
yvré
which
was
once
crowned
by
a
renaissance
chateau
where
henry
of
navarre
resided
when
he
reduced
le
mans
to
submission
northward
from
yvré
in
the
direction
of
savigné
stretches
the
high
plateau
of
sargé
which
on
the
west
slopes
down
towards
the
river
sarthe
and
forms
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
natural
defences
of
le
mans
eastward
from
yvré
you
overlook
first
the
huisne
spanned
at
various
neighbouring
points
by
four
bridges
but
having
much
of
the
in
its
valley
cut
up
by
little
for
purposes
of
irrigation
these
making
the
ground
additionally
difficult
for
an
attacking
force
to
traverse
secondly
you
see
a
long
plateau
called
auvours
the
possession
of
which
must
necessarily
facilitate
an
operations
following
the
course
of
the
coming
from
the
direction
of
paris
you
notice
several
pine
woods
planted
on
former
heaths
still
looking
eastward
is
the
village
of
champagné
where
the
slopes
are
studded
with
vines
whilst
the
plain
is
arable
land
dotted
over
with
clumps
of
chestnut
trees
of
champagné
is
montfort
where
chanzy
at
first
stationed
the
bulk
of
the
army
corps
under
jaurès
this
leaving
his
flying
columns
on
one
side
being
the
most
eastern
position
of
his
forces
at
the
time
when
the
german
advance
began
the
right
of
the
corps
here
rested
on
the
huisne
its
extreme
left
extended
northward
towards
the
sarthe
but
a
division
of
the
corps
under
general
de
colomb
guarded
the
alençon
and
conlie
railway
lines
confronted
by
the
huisne
the
heights
of
yvré
and
the
plateaux
of
sargé
and
auvours
having
for
the
most
part
to
keep
to
the
for
bad
as
their
state
might
be
at
that
season
it
was
nothing
compared
with
the
condition
of
the
many
narrow
and
often
deep
lanes
whose
high
banks
and
hedges
moreover
offered
opportunities
for
ambush
the
germans
it
was
obvious
would
have
a
difficult
task
before
them
on
the
eastern
side
of
le
mans
even
should
they
drive
the
corps
from
montfort
the
approach
to
the
town
is
easier
however
on
the
and
the
south
here
are
numerous
pine
woods
but
on
going
towards
le
mans
after
passing
and
mulsanne
the
ground
is
generally
much
less
hilly
than
on
the
east
there
are
however
certain
positions
favourable
for
defence
there
is
high
ground
at
changé
midway
between
the
road
from
saint
calais
to
le
mans
yvré
and
the
road
from
grand
lucé
to
le
mans
parigné
over
a
distance
of
eight
miles
moreover
there
extends
or
extended
at
the
time
i
refer
to
a
track
called
the
chemin
des
boeufs
suitable
for
defensive
purposes
with
high
ground
at
at
least
two
points
le
tertre
rouge
of
le
mans
and
la
tuilerie
south
of
the
town
the
line
of
the
chemin
des
boeufs
and
the
position
of
changé
was
at
first
entrusted
by
chanzy
to
the
corps
whose
commander
jauréguiberry
had
his
headquarters
at
the
southern
suburb
of
pontlieue
an
important
point
affording
direct
access
to
le
mans
by
a
stone
bridge
over
the
huisne
when
i
returned
to
le
mans
from
saint
servan
in
the
very
first
days
of
january
chanzy
forces
numbered
altogether
about
men
but
a
very
large
proportion
of
them
were
dispersed
in
different
directions
forming
detached
columns
under
generals
barry
curten
rousseau
and
jouffroy
the
troops
of
the
two
officers
had
been
taken
from
the
corps
jauréguiberry
those
of
rousseau
were
really
the
first
division
of
the
corps
jaurès
and
those
of
jouffroy
belonged
to
the
commanded
by
general
de
colomb
the
and
comprised
three
divisions
each
the
including
four
the
german
corps
were
generally
of
only
two
divisions
with
however
far
stronger
forces
of
cavalry
than
chanzy
disposed
of
it
is
a
curious
circumstance
that
among
the
german
troops
which
opposed
the
latter
forces
at
this
stage
of
the
war
there
was
a
division
commanded
by
a
general
von
colomb
both
these
officers
had
sprung
from
the
same
ancient
french
family
but
von
colomb
came
from
a
huguenot
branch
which
had
quitted
france
when
the
edict
of
nantes
was
revoked
chanzy
other
chief
coadjutors
at
le
mans
were
jaurès
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
and
jauréguiberry
who
after
the
chief
was
perhaps
the
most
able
of
all
the
commanders
of
basque
origin
and
born
in
he
had
distinguished
himself
as
a
naval
officer
in
the
crimean
chinese
and
cochin
china
expeditions
and
on
taking
service
in
the
army
under
the
national
defence
he
had
contributed
powerfully
to
victory
at
coulmiers
he
became
known
among
the
loire
forces
as
the
man
who
was
always
the
first
to
attack
and
the
last
to
retreat
he
looked
somewhat
older
than
his
years
warranted
being
very
bald
with
just
a
fringe
of
white
hair
round
the
cranium
his
upper
lip
and
chin
were
shaven
but
he
wore
white
whiskers
of
the
variety
slim
and
fairly
tall
he
was
possessed
of
no
little
nervous
strength
and
energy
in
later
years
he
became
minister
of
marine
in
the
waddington
the
second
freycinet
and
the
duclerc
cabinets
having
referred
to
chanzy
principal
subordinates
it
is
fitting
that
i
should
give
a
brief
account
of
chanzy
himself
the
son
of
an
officer
of
the
first
empire
he
was
born
at
nouart
in
the
argonne
and
from
his
personal
knowledge
of
that
region
it
is
certain
that
his
services
would
have
proved
valuable
during
the
disastrous
march
on
sedan
when
as
zola
has
rightly
pointed
out
in
la
débâcle
so
many
french
commanding
officers
were
altogether
ignorant
of
the
nature
and
possibilities
of
the
country
through
which
they
advanced
chanzy
however
like
many
others
who
figured
among
the
loire
forces
had
begun
life
in
the
navy
enlisting
in
that
service
when
sixteen
years
of
age
but
after
very
brief
experience
afloat
he
went
to
the
military
school
of
cyr
passed
out
of
it
as
a
in
when
he
was
in
his
year
was
appointed
to
a
regiment
of
zouaves
and
sent
to
algeria
he
served
however
in
the
italian
campaign
of
became
of
a
line
regiment
and
as
such
took
part
in
the
syrian
expedition
of
later
he
was
with
the
french
forces
garrisoning
rome
acquired
a
colonelcy
in
returned
to
algeria
and
in
was
promoted
to
the
rank
of
general
of
brigade
at
the
outset
of
the
war
he
applied
for
active
service
but
the
imperial
authorities
would
not
employ
him
in
france
in
spite
of
the
associations
of
his
family
with
the
first
empire
he
was
like
trochu
accounted
an
orleanist
and
it
was
not
desired
that
any
orleanist
general
should
have
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
contemplated
march
on
berlin
marshal
macmahon
however
as
governor
of
algeria
had
formed
a
high
opinion
of
chanzy
merits
and
after
sedan
anxious
as
he
was
for
his
country
in
her
predicament
the
marshal
then
a
prisoner
of
war
found
a
means
of
advising
the
national
defence
to
make
use
of
chanzy
services
that
patriotic
intervention
which
did
infinite
credit
to
macmahon
procured
for
chanzy
an
appointment
at
the
head
of
the
army
corps
and
later
the
chief
command
of
the
second
loire
army
when
i
first
saw
him
in
the
latter
days
of
he
was
in
his
year
well
built
and
taller
than
the
majority
of
french
officers
his
fair
hair
and
fair
moustache
had
become
grey
but
his
blue
eyes
had
remained
bright
and
there
was
an
expression
of
quiet
resolution
on
his
handsome
face
with
its
aquiline
nose
and
energetic
jaw
such
physically
was
the
general
whom
moltke
subsequently
declared
to
have
been
the
best
that
france
opposed
to
the
germans
throughout
the
war
i
never
once
saw
chanzy
excited
in
which
respect
he
greatly
contrasted
with
many
of
the
subordinate
commanders
jauréguiberry
was
sometimes
carried
away
by
his
basque
and
gougeard
by
his
celtic
blood
so
it
was
with
jaurès
who
though
born
in
paris
had
like
his
nephew
the
socialist
leader
the
blood
of
the
midi
in
his
veins
chanzy
however
belonged
to
a
calmer
a
more
quietly
resolute
northern
race
he
was
inclined
to
religion
and
i
remember
that
in
addition
to
the
chaplains
accompanying
the
breton
battalions
there
was
a
chief
chaplain
attached
to
the
general
staff
this
was
abbé
de
beuvron
a
member
of
an
old
noble
family
of
central
france
the
chief
of
the
staff
was
vuillemot
the
was
colonel
mora
and
the
principal
were
captains
marois
and
de
boisdeffre
specially
attached
to
the
headquarters
service
there
was
a
rather
numerous
picked
force
under
general
bourdillon
it
comprised
a
regiment
of
horse
gendarmes
and
one
of
foot
gendarmes
four
squadrons
of
chasseurs
some
artillery
provided
chiefly
with
an
aeronautical
company
under
the
brothers
tissandier
and
three
squadrons
of
algerian
light
cavalry
of
the
spahi
type
who
with
their
flowing
burnouses
and
their
swift
little
arab
horses
often
figured
conspicuously
in
chanzy
escort
a
year
or
two
after
the
war
i
engaged
one
of
these
very
men
he
was
called
saad
as
a
servant
and
he
proved
most
devoted
and
attentive
but
he
had
contracted
the
germs
of
pulmonary
disease
during
that
cruel
winter
of
and
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
i
had
to
take
him
to
the
military
hospital
in
paris
where
he
died
of
galloping
consumption
the
german
forces
opposed
to
chanzy
consisted
of
a
part
of
the
under
the
grand
duke
of
mecklenburg
and
the
second
army
under
prince
frederick
charles
of
prussia
the
latter
including
the
and
army
corps
and
disposing
of
numerous
cavalry
and
nearly
four
hundred
guns
the
prince
ascertained
that
the
french
forces
were
in
part
extremely
dispersed
and
therefore
resolved
to
act
before
they
could
be
concentrated
at
the
outset
the
germans
came
down
on
where
rousseau
column
was
stationed
inflicted
a
reverse
on
him
and
compelled
him
january
to
fall
back
on
connerré
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
from
nogent
and
of
less
than
sixteen
from
le
mans
on
the
same
day
sections
of
jouffroy
forces
were
defeated
at
epuisay
and
poirier
between
le
mans
and
vendôme
and
also
forced
to
retreat
the
french
detachments
under
jouffroy
curten
and
barry
which
were
stationed
along
the
line
from
saint
calais
to
montoire
and
thence
to
saint
amand
and
a
stretch
of
some
miles
were
not
strong
enough
to
oppose
the
german
advance
and
some
of
them
ran
the
risk
of
having
their
retreat
cut
off
chanzy
realized
the
danger
and
on
the
morning
of
january
he
despatched
jauréguiberry
to
take
command
of
all
the
troops
distributed
from
the
south
to
the
between
and
and
bring
them
to
le
mans
but
the
german
corps
was
advancing
in
these
directions
and
after
an
engagement
with
barry
troops
at
ruillé
secured
positions
round
la
chartre
this
seriously
threatened
the
retreat
of
the
column
under
general
curten
which
was
still
at
saint
amand
and
moreover
it
was
a
further
menace
to
barry
himself
as
his
division
was
distributed
over
a
front
of
fourteen
miles
near
jauréguiberry
however
entreated
barry
to
continue
guarding
the
river
loir
in
the
hope
of
curten
being
able
to
retreat
to
that
point
whilst
however
these
defensive
attempts
were
being
made
to
the
south
of
le
mans
the
germans
were
pressing
forward
on
the
and
the
east
prince
frederick
charles
being
eager
to
come
in
touch
with
main
forces
regardless
of
what
might
happen
on
the
loir
and
at
saint
amand
on
the
the
enemy
advanced
to
la
ferté
bernard
on
the
east
at
vancé
a
brigade
of
german
cavalry
drove
back
the
french
cuirassiers
and
algerians
and
prince
frederick
charles
then
proceeded
as
far
as
saint
calais
where
he
prepared
for
decisive
action
one
army
corps
was
sent
down
the
line
of
the
huisne
another
had
orders
to
advance
on
ardenay
a
third
on
bouloire
whilst
the
fourth
leaving
barry
on
its
left
flank
was
to
march
on
thus
excepting
a
brigade
of
infantry
and
one
of
cavalry
detached
to
observe
the
isolated
curten
and
hold
him
in
check
virtually
the
whole
of
the
german
second
army
marched
against
chanzy
main
forces
chanzy
on
his
side
now
ordered
jaurès
corps
to
occupy
the
positions
of
yvré
auvours
and
sargé
strongly
whilst
colomb
corps
was
instructed
to
send
general
pâris
division
forward
to
ardenay
thus
reducing
colomb
actual
command
to
one
division
as
jouffroy
column
had
previously
been
detached
from
it
on
both
sides
every
operation
was
attended
by
great
difficulties
on
account
of
the
very
severe
weather
a
momentary
thaw
had
been
followed
by
another
sudden
frost
in
such
wise
that
the
roads
had
a
coating
of
ice
which
rendered
them
extremely
slippery
on
january
violent
snowstorms
set
in
almost
blinding
one
and
yet
the
rival
hosts
did
not
for
an
hour
desist
from
their
respective
efforts
at
times
when
i
recall
those
days
i
wonder
whether
many
who
have
read
of
napoleon
retreat
from
moscow
have
fully
realized
what
that
meant
amidst
the
snowstorms
of
the
a
force
of
german
cavalry
attacked
our
extreme
left
and
compelled
it
to
retreat
towards
the
alençon
line
rousseau
column
being
in
a
dangerous
position
at
connerré
division
of
the
corps
was
sent
forward
to
support
it
in
the
direction
of
montfort
gougeard
with
his
bretons
also
advancing
to
support
colin
but
the
german
corps
attacked
rousseau
who
after
two
engagements
was
driven
from
connerré
and
forced
to
retreat
on
montfort
and
across
the
huisne
after
losing
in
killed
wounded
and
missing
some
of
his
men
whereas
the
enemy
lost
barely
a
hundred
at
the
same
time
gougeard
was
attacked
and
compelled
to
fall
back
on
but
the
principal
event
of
the
day
was
the
defeat
of
general
paris
force
at
ardenay
by
a
part
of
the
german
corps
the
latter
had
a
superiority
in
numbers
but
the
french
in
their
demoralised
condition
scarcely
put
up
a
fight
at
all
in
such
wise
that
the
germans
took
about
prisoners
the
worst
however
was
that
by
seizing
ardenay
the
enemy
drove
as
it
were
a
wedge
between
the
french
forces
hampering
their
concentration
meantime
the
german
corps
marched
to
bouloire
which
became
prince
frederick
charles
headquarters
the
corps
however
had
not
yet
been
able
to
advance
to
parigné
in
accordance
with
the
orders
though
it
had
driven
barry
back
on
jupilles
and
grand
lucé
the
sole
advantage
secured
by
the
french
that
day
was
that
curten
managed
to
retreat
from
but
it
was
only
on
the
night
of
the
when
he
could
be
of
little
or
no
use
to
chanzy
that
he
was
able
to
reach
where
in
response
to
chanzy
urgent
appeals
jauréguiberry
had
succeeded
in
collecting
a
few
thousand
men
to
reinforce
the
troops
defending
le
mans
for
four
days
there
had
been
fighting
on
one
and
another
point
from
the
to
the
south
of
the
town
the
result
being
unfavourable
to
the
french
chanzy
it
is
true
was
at
this
critical
moment
in
bad
health
according
to
one
account
which
i
heard
at
the
time
he
had
had
an
attack
of
dysentery
according
to
another
he
was
suffering
from
some
throat
complaint
combined
with
violent
neuralgic
pains
in
the
head
i
do
not
think
however
that
his
particularly
affected
the
issue
which
depended
so
largely
on
the
manner
in
which
his
plans
and
instructions
were
carried
out
the
strategy
adopted
by
the
germans
at
sedan
and
in
the
battles
around
metz
had
greatly
impressed
the
generals
who
commanded
the
french
armies
during
the
second
period
of
the
war
one
might
really
say
that
they
lived
in
perpetual
dread
of
being
surrounded
by
the
enemy
if
there
was
a
lack
of
concentration
on
chanzy
part
if
he
sent
out
one
and
another
flying
column
and
distributed
a
considerable
portion
of
his
army
over
a
wide
area
it
was
precisely
because
he
feared
some
turning
movement
on
the
part
of
the
germans
which
might
result
in
bottling
him
up
at
le
mans
the
earlier
instructions
which
prince
frederick
charles
forwarded
to
his
subordinates
certainly
seem
to
indicate
that
a
turning
movement
was
projected
but
after
the
fighting
on
january
when
as
i
have
indicated
the
german
army
corps
penetrated
into
the
french
lines
the
prince
renounced
any
idea
of
surrounding
chanzy
forces
and
resolved
to
make
a
vigorous
frontal
attack
before
they
could
be
reinforced
by
any
of
the
still
outlying
columns
in
coming
to
this
decision
the
prince
may
well
have
been
influenced
by
the
result
of
the
recent
fighting
which
had
sufficiently
demonstrated
the
superiority
of
the
german
troops
to
show
that
under
the
circumstances
a
frontal
attack
would
be
attended
with
far
less
risk
than
if
he
had
found
himself
faced
by
a
really
vigorous
antagonist
captain
hozier
whom
i
had
previously
seen
at
versailles
was
at
this
time
acting
as
correspondent
with
the
prince
army
and
in
subsequently
reviewing
the
fighting
he
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
issue
of
the
prince
operations
was
never
for
a
moment
doubtful
still
on
all
points
but
one
the
french
put
up
a
fairly
good
defence
as
i
will
now
show

some

on
the
morning
of
january
when
the
decisive
fighting
in
front
of
le
mans
really
began
on
the
evening
of
the
the
french
headquarters
was
still
without
news
of
generals
curten
barry
and
jouffroy
and
even
the
communications
with
jauréguiberry
were
of
an
intermittent
character
nevertheless
chanzy
had
made
up
his
mind
to
give
battle
and
had
sent
orders
to
jauréguiberry
to
send
jouffroy
towards
and
barry
towards
ecommoy
of
le
mans
but
the
roads
were
in
so
bad
a
condition
and
the
french
troops
had
been
so
severely
tried
and
were
so
for
that
several
of
the
instructions
could
not
be
carried
out
jouffroy
at
least
did
his
best
and
after
a
hard
and
tiring
march
from
grand
lucé
a
part
of
his
division
reached
parigné
in
time
to
join
in
the
action
fought
there
but
it
ended
disastrously
for
the
french
one
of
their
brigades
losing
as
many
as
men
and
the
germans
taking
altogether
some
prisoners
jouffroy

then
fell
back
to
pontlieue
the
southern
suburb
of
le

in
a
lamentable
condition
and
took

to
place

between

and

in
the
same
direction
paris
demoralised
division
already
worsted
at
ardenay
on
the
previous
day
was
driven
from
changé
by
the
german
corps
which
took
no
fewer
than
prisoners
it
had
now
almost
cut
the
french
eastern
and
southern
lines
apart
threatening
all
direct
communication
between
the
and
the
french
corps
nevertheless
it
was
in
a
dangerous
position
having
both
of
its
flanks
exposed
to
attack
one
from
yvré
and
auvours
and
the
other
from
pontlieue
and
the
chemin
des
boeufs
which
last
line
was
held
by
the
french
corps
meantime
gougeard
bretons
had
been
engaged
at
champagné
quite
a
close
encounter
taking
place
in
the
fields
and
on
the
vineyard
slopes
followed
by
a
fight
in
the
village
streets
the
french
were
at
last
driven
back
but
somewhat
later
on
the
germans
retiring
from
champagné
they
reoccupied
the
place
the
result
of
the
day
was
that
apart
from
the
somewhat
hazardous
success
achieved
by
the
german
corps
the
enemy
had
gained
no
great
advantage
his
corps
had
made
but
little
progress
his
had
not
been
brought
into
action
and
his
was
as
yet
no
nearer
than
grand
lucé
on
the
french
side
barry
had
at
last
reached
mulsanne
thus
covering
the
direct
southern
road
to
le

jauréguiberry
being
lower
down
at
ecommoy
with
some
men
of
various
arms
and

whom
he
had
managed
to
get
together
as
for
curten
division
as
it
could
not
possibly
reach
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
le
mans
in
time
for
the
fighting
on
the
it
received
orders
to
march
on
la
suze
of
the
imperilled
town
during
the
moreover
chanzy
was
strengthened
by
the
welcome
arrival
of
several
additional
and
a
large
number
of
horses
he
had
given
orders
to
raise
the
camp
of
conlie
but
instead
of
the
forty
or
fifty
thousand
men
which
at
an
earlier
period
it
was
thought
that
camp
would
be
able
to
provide
he
now
only
derived
from
it
some
badly
armed
and
almost
undrilled
breton
mobilisés
on
the
other
hand
as
i
previously
related
the
camp
had
already
provided
the
bulk
of
the
men
belonging
to
division
they
were
divided
into
six
battalions
one
of
which
came
from
saint
malo
the
others
from
rennes
and
redon
and
were
commanded
by
a
general
named
lalande
they
proved
to
be
no
accession
of
strength
they
became
on
the
contrary
a
source
of
weakness
and
disaster
for
it
was
their
behaviour
which
eventually
sealed
the
fate
of
the
second
loire
army
but
chanzy
whatever
his
ailments
might
be
was
personally
full
of
energy
and
determination
he
knew
moreover
that
two
new
army
corps
the
and
the
were
being
got
ready
to
reinforce
him
and
he
was
still
resolved
to
give
battle
and
hold
on
for
another
four
or
five
days
when
he
relied
on
compelling
prince
frederick
charles
to
retreat
then
with
his
reinforced
army
he
hoped
to
march
once
more
in
the
direction
of
paris
curiously
enough
it
was
precisely
on
that
critical
day
january
that
gambetta
sent
trochu
a
despatch
by
telling
him
that
on
the
at
the
latest
both
chanzy
and
bourbaki
would
be
moving
on
the
capital
having
between
them
over
men
but
if
chanzy
spirits
did
not
fail
him
those
of
his
men
were
at
a
very
low
ebb
indeed
he
was
repeatedly
told
so
by
subordinate
commanders
nevertheless
there
was
something
napoleonic
in
his
character
he
would
not
desist
from
his
design
but
issued
instructions
that
there
was
to
be
a
resolute
defence
of
the
lines
on
the
together
with
a
determined
effort
to
regain
all
lost
positions
at
the
same
time
the
statements
of
the
divisional
generals
respecting
the
low
of
some
of
the
troops
were
not
left
unheeded
for
a
very
significant
order
went
forth
namely
that
cavalry
should
be
drawn
up
in
the
rear
of
the
infantry
wherever
this
might
appear
advisable
the
inference
was
obvious
three
divisions
and
lalande
breton
mobilisés
were
to
hold
the
lines
from
arnage
along
the
track
known
as
the
chemin
des
boeufs
and
to
link
up
as
well
as
possible
with
pâris
and
divisions
to
which
fell
the
duty
of
guarding
the
plateau
of
auvours
and
the
banks
of
the
huisne
the
rest
of
the
corps
to
which
division
belonged
was
to
defend
the
space
between
the
huisne
and
the
sarthe
colomb
fragmentary
force
apart
from
pâris
division
was
still
to
cover
le
mans
towards
the
barry
men
on
their
expected
arrival
were
to
serve
as
reserves
around
pontlieue
the
morning
of
january
was
bright
the
snow
had
ceased
falling
but
lay
some
inches
thick
upon
the
ground
in
order
to
facilitate
the
passage
of
troops
and
particularly
of
military
waggons
through
the
town
the
mayor
of
le
mans
ordered
the
inhabitants
to
clear
away
as
much
of
this
snow
as
possible
but
it
naturally
remained
undisturbed
all
over
the
countryside
little
had
been
seen
of
chanzy
on
the
two
previous
days
but
that
morning
he
mounted
horse
and
rode
along
the
lines
from
the
elevated
position
known
as
le
tertre
rouge
to
the
equally
elevated
position
of
yvré
i
saw
him
there
wrapped
in
a
long
loose
cloak
the
hood
of
which
was
drawn
over
his
képi
near
him
was
his
picturesque
escort
of
algerian
spahis
and
while
he
was
conversing
with
some
officers
i
pulled
out
a
little
which
i
carried
and
tried
to
outline
the
group
an
who
noticed
me
at
once
came
up
to
inquire
what
i
was
doing
and
i
therefore
had
to
produce
the
permit
which
on
returning
to
the
front
i
had
obtained
from
the
chief
of
the
staff
it
was
found
to
be
quite
in
order
and
i
went
on
with
my
work
but
a
few
minutes
later
the
general
having
given
his
orders
gathered
up
his
reins
to
ride
away
as
he
slowly
passed
me
he
gave
me
just
one
little
sharp
glance
and
with
a
faint
suspicion
of
a
smile
remarked
i
will
look
at
that
another
time
the
had
previously
told
him
what
my
purpose
was
that
day
the
german
corps
again
resumed
the
offensive
and
once
more
drove
gougeard
out
of
champagné
then
the
enemy
corps
which
on
january
had
done
little
or
nothing
and
was
therefore
quite
fresh
was
brought
into
action
and
made
a
resolute
attack
on
the
plateau
of
auvours
there
was
a
fairly
long
fight
which
could
be
seen
from
yvré
but
the
germans
were
too
strong
for
pâris
men
who
at
last
disbanded
and
came
towards
the
bridge
of
yvré
in
terrible
confusion
flight
is
often
contagious
and
gougeard
who
had
fallen
back
from
champagné
in
fairly
good
order
feared
lest
his
men
should
imitate
their
comrades
he
therefore
pointed
two
on
the
runaways
and
by
that
means
checked
their
stampede
having
established
themselves
at
the
farther
end
of
the
plateau
the
germans
advanced
very
cautiously
constantly
seeking
cover
behind
the
various
hedges
general
de
colomb
to
whose
command
pâris
runaway
division
belonged
insisted
however
that
the
position
must
be
retaken
gougeard
thereupon
collected
a
very
miscellaneous
force
which
included
regular
infantry
mobiles
mobilisés
and
some
of
charette
volontaires
de
previously
known
in
borne
as
the
pontifical
zouaves
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
these
men
he
made
a
vigorous
effort
to
carry
out
colomb
orders
the
french
went
forward
almost
at
the
charge
the
germans
waiting
for
them
from
behind
the
hedges
whence
poured
a
hail
of
lead
gougeard
horse
was
shot
under
him
a
couple
of
bullets
went
through
his
coat
and
another
or
as
some
said
a
splinter
of
a
shell
knocked
off
his
képi
still
he
continued
leading
his
men
and
in
the
fast
failing
light
the
germans
after
repeated
encounters
were
driven
back
to
the
verge
of
the
plateau
that
was
told
me
afterwards
for
at
the
moment
i
was
already
on
my
way
back
to
le
mans
which
i
wished
to
reach
before
it
was
absolutely
night
on
coming
from
the
town
early
in
the
morning
i
had
brought
a
few
eatables
in
my
pockets
but
they
had
soon
been
consumed
and
i
had
found
it
impossible
to
obtain
any
food
whatever
at
yvré
though
some
of
the
very
indifferent
local
wine
was
procurable
thus
i
was
feeling
very
hungry
as
i
retraced
my
steps
through
the
snow
towards
the
little
hostelry
in
the
rue
du
gué
de
maulny
where
i
had
secured
accommodation
it
was
a
walk
of
some
four
or
five
miles
but
the
cold
urged
me
on
and
in
spite
of
the
snow
i
made
the
journey
fairly
rapidly
in
such
wise
that
little
more
than
an
hour
later
i
was
seated
in
a
warm
room
in
front
of
some
steaming
soup
answering
all
sorts
of
questions
as
to
what
i
had
seen
during
the
day
and
particularly
whether
had
gained
a
victory
i
could
only
answer
that
the
prussians
had
taken
auvours
but
that
fighting
was
still
going
on
as
gougeard
had
gone
to
recapture
the
position
at
the
moment
indeed
that
was
the
extent
of
my
information
the
landlord
looked
rather
glum
and
his
daughter
somewhat
anxious
and
the
former
shaking
his
head
exclaimed
monsieur
nous
pas
de
chance
pas
de
chance
du
tout
je
ne
sais
pas
à
quoi
ca
tient
mais
comme
ca
et
tenez
cela
ne
me
surprendrait
pas
de
voir
ces
sales
prussiens
dans
la
ville
à
demain
we
have
no
luck
no
luck
at
all
i
do
know
why
but
there
it
is
and
do
you
know
it
would
not
surprise
me
to
see
those
dirty
prussians
in
the
town
between
now
and
unfortunately
for
le
mans
and
for
france
also
his
forebodings
were
accurate
at
that
very
moment
indeed
a
great
disaster
was
occurring
jauréguiberry
had
reached
the
southern
suburb
of
pontlieue
at
about
nine
that
morning
after
a
night
march
from
ecommoy
he
had
divided
his
miscellaneous
force
of
men
into
three
brigades
as
they
did
not
seem
fit
for
immediate
action
they
were
drafted
into
the
reserves
so
that
their
arrival
was
of
no
particular
help
that
day
about
eleven
the
german
corps
coming
from
the
direction
of
changé
attacked
lines
along
the
more
northern
part
of
the
chemin
des
boeufs
and
though
jouffroy
men
fought
fairly
well
they
could
not
prevent
their
foes
from
capturing
the
position
of
the
tertre
rouge
still
the
enemy
gained
no
decisive
success
in
this
direction
nor
was
any
marked
result
attained
by
the
german
corps
which
formed
the
extreme
right
of
the
attacking
forces
but
prince
frederick
charles
had
sent
orders
to
voigts
rhetz
who
was
at
grand
lucé
a
brigade
of
cavalry
kept
up
communications
between
him
and
the
army
corps
advance
with
the
corps
on
mulsanne
which
the
french
had
evacuated
and
on
reaching
mulsanne
the
same
general
received
instructions
to
come
to
the
support
of
the
corps
which
was
engaged
with
jouffroy
force
voigts
rhetz
men
were
extremely
fatigued
nevertheless
the
division
of
infantry
commanded
by
general
went
on
towards
the
chemin
des
boeufs
following
the
direct
road
from
tours
to
le
mans
here
there
was
an
elevated
position
known
as
la
tuilerie
otherwise
the
which
had
been
fortified
expressly
to
prevent
the
germans
from
bursting
upon
le
mans
from
the
direct
south
for
guns
had
been
thrown
up
trenches
had
been
dug
the
pine
trees
so
abundant
on
the
southern
side
of
le
mans
had
been
utilised
for
other
shielding
works
as
well
as
for
for
the
defending
force
unfortunately
at
the
moment
of
the
german
advance
that
defending
force
consisted
of
the
badly
armed
and
almost
untrained
breton
mobilisés
there
were
just
a
few
old
soldiers
among
them
who
as
i
have
already
related
had
arrived
the
previous
day
from
the
camp
of
conlie
under
the
command
of
general
lalande
it
is
true
that
near
these
men
was
stationed
an
infantry
brigade
of
the
corps
whose
duty
it
was
to
support
and
steady
them
they
undoubtedly
needed
to
be
helped
for
the
great
majority
had
never
been
in
action
before
moreover
in
addition
to
the
infantry
brigade
there
were
two
batteries
of
artillery
but
i
fear
that
for
the
most
part
the
gunners
were
little
better
than
recruits
exaggerated
statements
have
been
made
respecting
the
quality
of
the
firearms
with
which
the
mobilisés
were
provided
many
of
the
weapons
were
afterwards
found
to
be
very
dirty
even
rusty
but
that
was
the
result
of
neglect
which
their
officers
should
have
remedied
it
is
true
however
that
these
weapons
were
for
the
most
part
merely
percussion
guns
again
it
has
been
said
that
the
men
had
no
ammunition
but
that
statement
was
certainly
inaccurate
on
the
other
hand
these
mobilisés
were
undoubtedly
very
cold
and
very
hungry
even
as
i
myself
was
that
day
no
rations
having
been
served
to
them
until
late
in
the
afternoon
that
is
shortly
before
they
were
attacked
at
which
moment
indeed
they
were
actually
preparing
the
meal
for
which
they
had
so
long
been
waiting
the
wintry
night
was
gathering
round
when
found
himself
with
his
division
before
the
position
of
la
tuilerie
he
could
see
that
it
was
fortified
and
before
attempting
any
further
advance
he
fired
a
few
shells
the
mobilisés
were
immediately
they
made
no
attempt
at
defence
hungry
though
they
were
they
abandoned
even
their
pots
and
pans
and
fled
in
the
direction
of
pontlieue
which
formed
as
it
were
a
long
avenue
fringed
with
factories
textile
mills
bleaching
works
and
so
forth
in
vain
did
their
officers
try
to
stop
the
fugitives
even
striking
them
with
the
flats
of
their
swords
in
vain
did
lalande
and
his
staff
seek
to
intercept
them
at
the
rond
point
de
pontlieue
nothing
could
induce
them
to
stop
they
threw
away
their
weapons
in
order
to
run
the
faster
at
la
tuilerie
not
a
gun
was
fired
at
the
germans
even
the
infantry
brigade
fell
back
without
attempting
to
fight
all
this
occurred
at
a
moment
when
everybody
thought
that
the
fighting
was
over
but
jauréguiberry
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
ordered
one
of
his
subordinates
general
lebouëdeo
to
retake
the
lost
position
lebouëdeo
tried
to
do
so
with
tired
men
who
had
been
in
action
during
the
day
and
failed
a
second
attempt
proved
equally
futile
no
effort
apparently
was
made
to
secure
help
from
barry
who
was
at
arnage
with
infantry
and
two
brigades
of
cavalry
and
who
might
have
fallen
on
the
left
flank
of
the
german
corps
la
tuilerie
was
lost
and
with
it
le
mans
was
lost
also
i
was
quietly
sipping
some
coffee
and
reading
the
local
newspapers
three
or
four
were
published
at
le
mans
in
those
days
when
i
heard
of
that
disastrous
stampede
some
of
the
men
had
reached
the
town
spreading
the
contagion
of
fear
as
they
came
tired
though
i
was
i
at
once
went
towards
the
avenue
de
fontlieue
where
the
excitement
was
general
gendarmes
were
hurrying
hither
and
thither
often
arresting
the
runaways
and
at
other
times
picking
up
weapons
and
which
had
been
flung
away
so
numerous
were
the
abandoned
weapons
and
equipments
that
cartloads
of
them
were
collected
every
now
and
then
an
estafette
galloped
to
or
from
the
town
the
civilians
whom
one
met
wore
looks
of
consternation
it
was
evident
indeed
to
everybody
who
knew
how
important
was
the
position
of
la
tuilerie
that
its
capture
by
the
germans
placed
le
mans
in
jeopardy
when
the
two
attempts
to
retake
it
had
failed
jauréguiberry
urged
immediate
retreat
this
was
rendered
the
more
imperative
by
other
events
of
the
night
and
the
early
morning
for
inspirited
by
their
capture
of
la
tuilerie
the
germans
made
fresh
efforts
in
other
directions
so
that
barry
had
to
quit
arnage
whilst
jouffroy
lost
most
of
his
positions
near
the
chemin
des
boeufs
and
the
plateau
had
again
to
be
evacuated
at
on
january
chanzy
after
suggesting
a
fresh
attempt
to
recover
la
tuilerie
which
was
prevented
by
the
demoralisation
of
the
troops
was
compelled
to
give
a
reluctant
assent
to
proposals
of
retreat
at
the
same
time
he
wished
the
retreat
to
be
carried
out
slowly
and
methodically
and
informed
gambetta
that
he
intended
to
withdraw
in
the
direction
of
aleneon
orne
and
mayenne
this
meant
moving
into
normandy
and
gambetta
pointed
out
that
such
a
course
would
leave
all
brittany
open
to
the
enemy
and
enable
him
to
descend
without
opposition
even
to
the
mouth
of
the
loire
chanzy
was
therefore
instructed
to
retreat
on
laval
and
did
so
but
as
he
had
already
issued
orders
for
the
other
route
great
confusion
ensued
the
new
orders
only
reaching
the
subordinate
commanders
on
the
evening
of
the
from
january
to
the
french
had
lost
men
in
killed
and
wounded
the
germans
had
taken
prisoners
and
captured
seventeen
guns
and
a
large
quantity
of
army
materiel
further
there
was
an
incalculable
number
of
disbanded
mobiles
and
mobilisés
if
prince
frederick
charles
had
known
at
the
time
to
what
a
deplorable
condition
chanzy
army
had
been
reduced
he
would
probably
have
acted
more
vigorously
than
he
did
it
is
true
that
his
own
men
as
von
hoenig
has
admitted
were
generally
speaking
in
a
state
of
great
fatigue
after
the
six
days
fighting
and
also
often
badly
circumstanced
in
regard
to
clothing
boots
and
equipments
even
when
the
armistice
arrived
i
saw
many
german
soldiers
wearing
french
sabots
such
things
can
not
last
for
ever
and
there
had
been
little
or
no
opportunity
to
renew
anything
since
the
second
battle
of
orleans
early
in
december
in
the
fighting
before
le
mans
however
the
german
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
was
only
of
the
number
being
officers
whom
the
french
picked
off
as
often
as
possible
on
the
morning
of
the
all
was
confusion
at
pontlieue
guns
waggons
horsemen
infantrymen
were
congregated
there
half
blocking
up
the
bridge
which
connects
this
suburb
with
le
mans
a
small
force
under
general
de
roquebrune
was
gallantly
striving
to
check
the
germans
at
one
part
of
the
chemin
des
boeufs
in
order
to
cover
the
retreat
a
cordon
of
gendarmes
had
been
drawn
up
at
the
to
prevent
it
from
being
invaded
by
all
the
runaways
some
hundreds
of
wounded
men
were
allowed
access
however
in
order
that
they
might
if
possible
get
away
in
one
of
the
many
trains
which
were
being
sent
off
as
rapidly
as
possible
this
service
was
in
charge
of
an
official
named
piquet
who
acted
with
the
greatest
energy
and
acumen
of
the
five
meeting
at
le
mans
only
two
were
available
that
running
to
rennes
laval
and
that
running
to
angers
i
find
from
a
report
drawn
up
by
piquet
a
little
later
that
he
managed
to
send
off
trains
some
of
them
drawn
by
two
and
three
engines
they
included
about
vans
trucks
and
coaches
that
is
vans
laden
with
provisions
in
part
for
the
relief
of
paris
vans
and
trucks
laden
with
artillery
and
stores
vans
of
ammunition
empty
vans
and
trucks
and
passenger
carriages
on
securing
possession
of
the
station
however
the
germans
still
found
there
about
vans
and
carriages
and
at
least
a
dozen
locomotive
engines
the
last
train
left
at
i
myself
got
away
as
i
shall
presently
relate
shortly
after
two
when
the
station
was
already
being
bombarded
general
de
roquebrune
having
at
last
been
compelled
to
withdraw
from
the
vicinity
of
the
chemin
des
boeufs
the
germans
came
on
to
the
long
avenue
of
pontlieue
here
they
were
met
by
most
of
the
corps
of
gendarmes
which
as
i
previously
related
was
attached
to
the
under
general
bourdillon
these
men
who
had
two
gatlings
with
them
behaved
with
desperate
bravery
in
order
to
delay
the
german
entry
into
the
town
about
a
hundred
of
them
including
a
couple
of
officers
were
killed
during
that
courageous
defence
it
was
found
impossible
however
to
blow
up
the
bridge
the
operation
had
been
delayed
as
long
as
possible
in
order
to
facilitate
the
french
retreat
and
when
the
gendarmes
themselves
withdrew
there
no
longer
remained
sufficient
time
to
put
it
into
execution
the
first
germans
to
enter
the
town
belonged
to
the
brigade
of
infantry
and
to
part
of
a
cavalry
force
under
general
von
schmidt
after
crossing
the
bridge
of
pontlieue
they
divided
into
three
columns
one
of
them
proceeded
up
the
rue
du
quartier
de
cavalerie
in
the
direction
of
the
place
des
jacobins
and
the
cathedral
the
second
also
went
towards
the
upper
town
marching
however
by
way
of
the
rue
basse
which
conducted
to
the
place
des
halles
where
the
chief
hotels
and
cafés
were
situated
meantime
the
third
column
turned
to
the
left
and
hastened
towards
the
railway
station
but
to
their
great
amazement
their
advance
was
repeatedly
checked
there
were
still
a
number
of
french
soldiers
in
the
town
among
them
being
mobile
guards
gendarmes
and
a
party
of
marine
fusiliers
the
german
column
which
began
to
ascend
the
rue
basse
was
repeatedly
fired
at
whereupon
its
commanding
officer
halted
his
men
and
by
way
of
punishment
had
seven
houses
set
on
fire
before
attempting
to
proceed
farther
nevertheless
the
resistance
was
prolonged
at
various
points
on
the
place
des
jacobins
for
instance
and
again
on
the
place
des
halles
near
the
latter
square
is
or
was
a
little
street
called
the
rue
dumas
from
which
the
french
picked
off
a
dozen
or
twenty
germans
so
infuriating
their
commander
that
he
sent
for
a
couple
of
and
threatened
to
sweep
the
whole
town
with
projectiles
meantime
a
number
of
the
french
who
had
lingered
at
le
mans
were
gradually
effecting
their
escape
many
artillery
and
commissariat
waggons
managed
to
get
away
and
a
local
notability
eugène
caillaux
father
of
joseph
caillaux
who
was
french
prime
minister
during
the
latter
half
of
and
who
is
now
minister
of
finances
succeeded
in
sending
out
of
the
town
several
carts
full
of
rifles
which
some
of
the
french
troops
had
flung
away
however
the
could
not
be
indefinitely
prolonged
it
ceased
when
about
a
hundred
germans
and
a
larger
number
of
french
both
soldiers
and
civilians
had
been
killed
the
germans
avenged
themselves
by
pillaging
the
houses
in
the
rue
dumas
and
several
on
the
place
des
halles
though
they
spared
the
hôtel
de
france
there
as
their
commander
voigts
rhetz
reserved
it
for
his
own
accommodation
whilst
the
bombardment
of
a
part
of
the
lower
town
continued
the
railway
station
and
the
barracks
called
the
caserne
de
la
mission
being
particularly
affected
raids
were
made
on
the
french
ambulances
in
one
of
which
on
the
boulevard
négrier
a
patient
was
barbarously
bayoneted
in
his
bed
on
the
pretext
that
he
was
a
whereas
he
really
belonged
to
the
mobile
guard
at
the
ambulance
of
the
école
normale
the
sisters
and
clergy
were
according
to
their
sworn
statements
grossly
patients
some
of
whom
were
suffering
from
smallpox
were
turned
out
of
their
beds
which
were
required
it
was
said
for
the
german
wounded
all
the
wine
that
could
be
found
was
drunk
money
was
stolen
and
there
was
vindictive
destruction
on
all
sides
the
mayor
the
prefect
le
chevalier
had
followed
the
army
in
its
retreat
considering
it
his
duty
to
watch
over
the
uninvaded
part
of
the
department
of
the
sartha
of
le
mans
richard
and
his
two
or
deputies
went
down
through
the
town
carrying
a
towel
as
a
flag
of
truce
and
on
the
place
de
la
mission
they
at
last
found
voigts
rhetz
surrounded
by
his
staff
the
general
at
once
informed
the
mayor
that
in
consequence
of
the
resistance
of
the
town
it
would
have
to
pay
a
of
four
millions
of
francs
within
hours
and
that
the
inhabitants
would
have
to
lodge
and
feed
the
german
forces
as
long
as
they
remained
there
all
the
appeals
made
against
these
hard
conditions
were
disregarded
during
nearly
a
fortnight
when
both
the
mayor
and
the
bishop
of
le
mans
solicited
audiences
of
prince
frederick
charles
they
were
told
by
the
famous
count
harry
von
arnim
who
curiously
enough
subsequently
became
german
ambassador
to
france
but
embroiled
himself
with
bismarck
and
died
in
exile
that
if
they
only
wished
to
tender
their
humble
duty
to
the
prince
he
would
graciously
receive
them
but
that
he
refused
to
listen
to
any
representations
on
behalf
of
the
town
a
first
sum
of
and
some
smaller
ones
were
at
last
got
together
in
this
town
of
inhabitants
and
finally
on
january
the
total
levy
was
reduced
as
a
special
favour
to
certain
german
requisitions
were
also
to
be
set
off
against
of
that
amount
but
they
really
represented
about
double
the
figure
a
public
loan
had
to
be
raised
in
the
midst
of
continual
exactions
which
lasted
even
after
the
preliminaries
of
peace
had
been
signed
the
germans
regarding
le
mans
as
a
milch
cow
from
which
too
much
could
not
be
extracted
the
anxieties
of
the
time
might
well
have
sufficed
to
make
the
mayor
ill
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
caught
and
his
place
had
to
be
taken
by
a
deputy
who
with
the
municipal
council
to
which
several
local
notabilities
were
adjoined
did
all
that
was
possible
to
satisfy
the
greed
of
the
germans
i
may
mention
was
very
prevalent
at
le
mans
and
some
of
the
ambulances
were
specially
reserved
for
soldiers
who
had
contracted
that
disease
altogether
about
men
both
french
and
germans
suffering
from
wounds
or
diseases
of
various
kinds
were
treated
in
the
town
ambulances
from
november
to
april
some
thousands
of
germans
were
billeted
on
the
inhabitants
whom
they
frequently
robbed
with
impunity
all
complaints
addressed
to
the
german
governor
an
officer
named
von
heiduck
being
disregarded
this
individual
ordered
all
the
inhabitants
to
give
up
any
weapons
which
they
possessed
under
penalty
of
death
another
proclamation
ordained
the
same
punishment
for
anybody
who
might
give
the
slightest
help
to
the
french
army
or
attempt
to
hamper
the
german
forces
moreover
the
editors
printers
and
managers
of
three
local
newspapers
were
summarily
arrested
and
kept
in
durance
on
account
of
articles
against
the
germans
which
they
had
written
printed
or
published
chanzy
defeat
on
january
which
chanced
to
be
a
friday
prince
frederick
charles
made
his
triumphal
entry
into
le
mans
the
bands
of
the
german
regiments
playing
all
their
more
popular
patriotic
airs
along
the
route
which
his
royal
highness
took
in
order
to
reach
the
prefecture
a
former
convent
where
he
intended
to
install
himself
on
the
following
day
the
mayor
received
the
following
letter
mayor
i
request
you
to
send
to
the
prefecture
by
five
this
afternoon
spoons
forks
and
knives
as
only
just
sufficient
for
the
number
of
people
at
table
have
been
sent
and
there
is
no
means
of
changing
the
covers
for
dinner
you
will
provide
bottles
of
bordeaux
bottles
of
champagne
two
bottles
of
madeira
and
bottles
of
liqueurs
which
must
be
at
the
prefecture
at
six
precisely
the
wine
previously
sent
not
being
good
neither
the
bordeaux
nor
the
champagne
you
must
send
better
kinds
otherwise
i
shall
have
to
inflict
a
fine
upon
the
town
signed
von
kanitz
this
communication
was
followed
almost
immediately
afterwards
by
another
emanating
from
the
same
officer
who
was
one
of
the
he
therein
stated
invariably
employing
be
it
said
execrable
french
that
the
was
to
be
served
at
the
prefecture
at
the
at
noon
and
the
dinner
at
at
ten
every
morning
the
mayor
was
to
send
bottles
of
bordeaux
bottles
of
champagne
bottles
of
madeira
and
bottles
of
liqueurs
he
was
also
to
provide
waiters
to
serve
at
table
and
and
and
kanitz
concluded
by
saying
if
the
least
thing
fails
a
remarkable
fine
will
be
inflicted
on
the
town
on
january
an
order
was
sent
to
the
mayor
to
supply
at
once
for
the
prince
requirements
kilogrammes
of
ham
kilos
of
sausages
kilos
of
tongues
dozen
eggs
vegetables
of
all
sorts
particularly
onions
kilos
of
gruyère
cheese
kilos
of
parmesan
kilos
of
best
veal
fowls
turkeys
ducks
kilos
of
powdered
sugar
all
the
german
orders
and
requisitions
are
preserved
in
the
municipal
archives
of
le
mans
no
wine
was
ever
good
enough
for
prince
frederick
charles
and
his
staff
the
complaints
sent
to
the
were
incessant
moreover
the
supply
of
champagne
by
no
means
large
in
such
a
place
as
le
mans
gave
out
and
then
came
all
sorts
of
threats
the
municipal
councillors
had
to
trot
about
trying
to
discover
a
few
bottles
here
and
there
in
private
houses
in
order
to
supply
the
requirements
of
the
princely
staff
there
was
also
a
scarcity
of
vegetables
and
yet
there
were
incessant
demands
for
spinach
cauliflowers
and
artichokes
and
even
fruit
for
the
prince
tarts
one
day
kanitz
went
to
the
house
where
the
unfortunate
mayor
was
lying
in
bed
and
told
him
that
he
must
get
up
and
provide
vegetables
as
none
had
been
sent
for
the
prince
table
the
mayor
protested
that
the
whole
countryside
was
covered
with
snow
and
that
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
satisfy
such
incessant
demands
but
as
he
afterwards
related
ill
and
worried
though
he
was
he
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
when
he
was
required
to
supply
several
pounds
of
truffles
truffles
at
le
mans
indeed
in
those
days
too
the
idea
was
quite
ridiculous
not
only
had
the
demands
of
prince
frederick
charles
staff
to
be
satisfied
but
there
were
those
of
voigts
rhetz
and
of
all
the
officers
lodging
at
the
hôtel
de
france
the
hôtel
du
dauphin
the
hôtel
de
la
boule
and
other
hostelries
these
gentlemen
were
very
fond
of
giving
dinners
and
mine
host
was
constantly
being
called
upon
to
provide
all
sorts
of
delicacies
at
short
notice
the
cellars
of
the
hôtel
de
france
were
drunk
dry
the
common
soldiers
also
demanded
the
best
of
everything
at
the
houses
where
they
were
billeted
and
sometimes
they
played
extraordinary
pranks
there
half
a
dozen
of
them
who
were
lodged
at
a
in
i
think
the
rue
dumas
broached
a
cask
of
brandy
poured
the
contents
into
a
tub
and
washed
their
feet
in
the
spirituous
liquor
it
may
be
that
a
brandy
bath
is
a
good
thing
for
sore
feet
and
that
might
explain
the
incident
however
when
i
think
of
it
i
am
always
reminded
of
how
in
the
days
of
the
second
empire
the
spendthrift
due
de
entered
the
café
anglais
in
paris
one
afternoon
called
for
a
silver
had
two
or
three
bottles
of
champagne
poured
into
it
and
then
made
an
unrepentant
magdalen
of
the
boulevards
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
wash
his
feet
in
the
sparkling
wine
from
that
afternoon
until
the
café
anglais
passed
out
of
existence
no
silver
were
ever
used
there
i
have
given
the
foregoing
particulars
respecting
the
german
occupation
of
le
mans
they
are
principally
derived
from
official
documents
just
to
show
the
reader
what
one
might
expect
if
for
instance
a
german
force
should
land
at
hull
or
grimsby
and
fight
its
way
successfully
to
let
us
say
york
or
leeds
or
nottingham
the
incidents
which
occurred
at
le
mans
were
by
no
means
peculiar
to
that
town
many
similar
instances
occurred
throughout
the
invaded
regions
of
france
i
certainly
do
not
wish
to
impute
gluttony
to
prince
frederick
charles
personally
but
during
the
years
which
followed
the
war
i
made
three
fairly
long
stays
at
berlin
putting
up
at
good
hotels
where
officers
sometimes
generals
often
lunched
and
dined
and
their
appetites
frequently
amazed
me
whilst
their
manners
at
table
were
repulsive
in
those
days
most
german
officers
were
bearded
and
i
noticed
that
between
the
courses
at
luncheon
and
at
dinner
it
was
a
common
practice
of
theirs
to
produce
and
and
comb
their
beards
as
well
as
the
hair
on
their
heads
over
the
table
as
for
their
manner
of
eating
and
the
noise
they
made
in
doing
so
the
less
said
the
better
in
regard
to
manners
i
have
always
felt
that
the
french
of
were
in
some
respects
quite
entitled
to
call
their
enemies
barbarians
but
that
was
years
ago
and
as
time
works
wonders
the
manners
of
the
german
military
element
may
have
improved
in
saying
something
about
the
general
appearance
of
le
mans
i
pointed
out
that
the
town
now
has
a
place
de
la
république
a
gambetta
bridge
a
rue
thiers
and
a
statue
of
chanzy
but
at
the
period
of
the
war
and
for
a
long
time
afterwards
it
detested
the
republic
invariably
returning
bonapartist
or
orleanist
deputies
sneered
at
gambetta
and
hotly
denounced
the
commander
of
the
loire
army
its
grievance
against
chanzy
was
that
he
had
made
it
his
headquarters
and
given
battle
in
its
immediate
vicinity
the
conflict
having
ended
disastrously
for
the
french
arms
the
townsfolk
lamented
that
it
had
ever
taken
place
why
had
chanzy
brought
his
army
there
they
indignantly
inquired
he
might
very
well
have
gone
elsewhere
so
strong
was
this
manceau
feeling
against
the
general
a
feeling
inspired
by
the
sufferings
which
the
inhabitants
experienced
at
the
time
notably
in
consequence
of
the
german
exactions
that
fifteen
years
later
when
the
general
statue
for
which
there
had
been
a
national
subscription
was
set
up
in
the
town
the
displeasure
there
was
very
great
and
the
monument
was
subjected
to
the
most
shameful
indignities
at
nouart
his
native
place
there
is
another
statue
of
chanzy
which
shows
him
pointing
towards
the
east
on
the
pedestal
is
the
inscription
the
generals
who
wish
to
obtain
the
bâton
of
marshal
of
france
must
seek
it
across
the
rhine
words
spoken
by
him
in
one
of
his
speeches
subsequent
to
the
war
but
all
that
has
passed
nowadays
both
at
auvours
and
at
pontlieue
there
are
monuments
to
those
who
fell
fighting
for
france
around
le
mans
and
doubtless
the
town
in
becoming
more
republican
has
become
more
patriotic
also
before
relating
how
i
escaped
from
le
mans
on
the
day
when
the
retreat
was
ordered
there
are
a
few
other
points
with
which
i
should
like
to
deal
briefly
it
is
tolerably
well
known
that
i
made
the
english
translation
of
emile
zola
great
novel
la
débâcle
and
a
good
many
of
my
present
readers
may
have
read
that
work
either
in
the
original
french
or
in
the
version
prepared
by
me
now
i
have
always
thought
that
some
of
the
characters
introduced
by
zola
into
his
narrative
were
somewhat
exceptional
i
doubt
if
there
were
many
such
absolutely
neurotic
degenerates
as
maurice
in
the
french
army
at
any
period
of
the
war
i
certainly
never
came
across
such
a
character
again
the
psychology
of
stephen
crane
red
badge
of
courage
published
a
few
years
after
la
débâcle
and
received
with
acclamations
by
critics
most
of
whom
had
never
in
their
lives
been
under
fire
also
seems
to
me
to
be
of
an
exceptional
character
i
much
prefer
the
psychology
of
the
waterloo
episode
in
stendhal
chartreuse
de
parme
because
it
is
of
more
general
application
the
red
badge
of
courage
so
the
critics
told
us
showed
what
a
soldier
exactly
felt
and
thought
in
the
midst
of
warfare
unlike
stendhal
however
its
author
had
never
served
no
more
had
zola
and
i
feel
that
many
of
the
pictures
which
novelists
have
given
us
of
a
soldier
emotions
when
in
action
apply
only
to
exceptional
cases
and
are
even
then
somewhat
exaggerated
in
action
there
is
no
time
for
thought
the
most
trying
hours
for
a
man
who
is
in
any
degree
of
a
sensitive
nature
are
those
spent
in
as
a
sentry
or
as
one
of
a
small
party
at
some
lonely
outpost
then
thoughts
of
home
and
happiness
and
of
those
one
loves
may
well
arise
there
is
one
little
point
in
connexion
with
this
subject
which
i
must
mention
whenever
letters
were
found
on
the
bodies
of
men
who
fell
during
the
war
they
were
if
this
man
was
a
frenchman
more
usually
letters
from
his
mother
and
if
he
was
a
german
more
usually
letters
from
his
sweetheart
many
such
letters
found
their
way
into
print
during
the
course
of
the
war
it
is
a
fact
that
a
cult
for
his
mother
is
a
trait
of
the
national
character
and
that
a
frenchwoman
almost
always
places
her
child
before
her
husband
but
what
struck
me
particularly
during
the
war
was
that
the
anxieties
and
mental
sufferings
of
the
french
officers
were
much
keener
than
those
of
the
men
many
of
those
officers
were
married
some
had
young
children
and
in
the
silent
hours
of
a
lonely
their
thoughts
often
travelled
to
their
dear
ones
i
well
remember
how
an
officer
virtually
unbosomed
himself
to
me
on
this
subject
one
night
near
the
reason
of
it
all
is
obvious
the
higher
a
intelligence
the
greater
is
his
sense
of
responsibility
and
the
force
of
his
attachments
but
in
action
the
latter
are
set
aside
they
only
obtrude
at
such
times
as
i
have
said
or
else
at
the
moment
of
death
of
actual
cowardice
there
were
undoubtedly
numerous
instances
during
the
war
but
a
great
deal
might
be
said
in
defence
of
many
of
the
men
who
here
and
there
abandoned
their
positions
during
the
last
months
their
sufferings
were
frequently
terrible
at
best
they
were
often
only
partially
trained
there
was
little
cohesion
in
many
battalions
there
was
a
great
lack
of
efficient
officers
instead
of
drafting
regular
soldiers
from
the
into
special
regiments
as
was
often
done
it
might
have
been
better
to
have
distributed
them
among
the
mobiles
and
mobilisés
whom
they
would
have
steadied
judging
by
all
that
i
witnessed
at
that
period
i
consider
it
essential
that
any
territorial
force
should
always
contain
a
certain
number
of
trained
soldiers
who
have
previously
been
in
action
and
any
such
force
should
always
have
the
support
of
regulars
and
of
efficient
artillery
i
have
related
how
certain
breton
mobilisés
abandoned
la
tuilerie
they
fled
before
the
regulars
or
the
artillery
could
support
them
but
they
were
perhaps
the
very
rawest
levies
in
all
chanzy
forces
other
breton
mobilisés
on
other
points
fought
very
well
for
men
of
their
class
for
instance
no
reproach
could
be
addressed
to
the
battalions
of
brieuo
brest
quimper
lorient
and
nantes
they
were
better
trained
than
were
the
men
stationed
at
la
tuilerie
and
it
requires
some
time
to
train
a
breton
properly
that
effected
he
makes
a
good
soldier
respecting
my
own
feelings
during
that
war
i
may
say
that
the
paramount
one
was
curiosity
to
be
a
journalist
a
man
must
be
inquisitive
it
is
a
quâ
of
his
profession
moreover
i
was
very
young
i
had
no
responsibilities
i
may
have
been
in
love
or
have
thought
i
was
but
i
was
on
my
own
and
my
chief
desire
was
to
see
as
much
as
i
could
i
willingly
admit
that
when
gougeard
column
was
abruptly
attacked
at
droué
i
experienced
some
trepidation
at
finding
myself
under
fire
but
firmness
may
prove
as
contagious
as
fear
and
when
gougeard
rallied
his
men
and
went
forward
to
repel
the
germans
interest
and
a
kind
of
excitement
took
possession
of
me
moreover
as
i
was
at
least
nominally
attached
to
the
ambulance
service
there
was
duty
to
be
done
and
that
left
no
opportunity
for
thought
the
pictures
of
the
ambulances
in
or
near
sedan
are
among
the
most
striking
ones
contained
in
la
débâcle
and
judging
by
what
i
saw
elsewhere
zola
exaggerated
nothing
the
ambulance
is
the
truly
horrible
side
of
warfare
to
see
men
lying
dead
on
the
ground
is
so
to
say
nothing
one
gets
used
to
it
but
to
see
them
amputated
and
to
see
them
lying
in
bed
suffering
often
acutely
from
dreadful
wounds
or
horrible
diseases
dysentery
typhus
that
is
the
thing
which
tries
the
nerves
of
all
but
the
doctors
and
the
trained
nurses
on
several
occasions
i
helped
to
carry
wounded
men
and
felt
no
emotion
in
doing
so
but
more
than
once
i
was
almost
overcome
by
the
sight
of
all
the
suffering
in
some
ambulance
when
on
the
morning
of
january
i
heard
that
a
general
retreat
had
been
ordered
i
hesitated
as
to
what
course
i
should
pursue
i
did
not
then
anticipate
the
and
the
consequent
violence
of
the
germans
but
journalistic
instinct
told
me
that
if
i
remained
in
the
town
until
after
the
german
entry
i
might
then
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
away
and
communicate
with
my
people
at
the
same
time
i
did
not
think
the
german
entry
so
imminent
as
proved
to
be
the
case
and
i
spent
a
considerable
time
in
the
streets
watching
all
the
tumult
which
prevailed
there
now
and
again
a
sadly
diminished
battalion
went
by
in
fairly
good
order
but
numbers
of
disbanded
men
hurried
hither
and
thither
in
confusion
here
and
there
a
street
was
blocked
with
army
vans
and
waggons
whose
drivers
were
awaiting
orders
not
knowing
which
direction
to
take
officers
and
estafettes
galloped
about
on
all
sides
then
a
number
of
wounded
men
were
carried
in
carts
on
stretchers
and
on
trucks
towards
the
others
with
their
heads
bandaged
or
their
arms
in
slings
walked
painfully
in
the
same
direction
outside
the
station
there
was
a
strong
cordon
of
gendarmes
striving
to
resist
all
the
pressure
of
a
great
mob
of
disbanded
men
who
wished
to
enter
and
get
away
in
the
trains
at
one
moment
when
after
quite
a
struggle
some
of
the
wounded
were
conveyed
through
the
mob
and
the
cordon
the
disbanded
soldiers
followed
and
many
of
them
fought
their
way
into
the
station
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
gendarmes
the
was
so
desperate
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
follow
but
after
watching
it
for
some
time
retraced
my
steps
towards
my
lodging
all
was
hubbub
and
confusion
at
the
little
inn
and
only
with
difficulty
could
i
get
anything
to
eat
there
a
little
later
however
i
managed
to
tell
the
landlord
his
name
was
dubuisson
that
i
meant
to
follow
the
army
and
if
possible
secure
a
place
in
one
of
the
trains
which
were
frequently
departing
after
stowing
a
few
necessaries
away
in
my
pockets
i
begged
him
to
take
charge
of
my
bag
until
some
future
day
and
the
worthy
old
man
then
gave
me
some
tips
as
to
how
i
might
make
my
way
into
the
station
by
going
a
little
beyond
it
and
climbing
a
palisade
we
condoled
with
one
another
and
shook
hands
i
then
went
out
the
cannonade
which
had
been
going
on
for
several
hours
had
now
become
more
violent
several
shells
had
fallen
on
or
near
the
caserne
de
la
mission
during
the
morning
now
others
were
falling
near
the
i
went
my
way
however
turned
to
the
right
on
quitting
the
rue
du
reached
some
palings
and
got
on
to
the
skirting
it
i
turned
to
the
left
going
back
towards
the
station
i
passed
one
or
two
trains
which
were
waiting
but
they
were
composed
of
trucks
and
closed
vans
i
might
perhaps
have
climbed
on
to
one
of
the
former
but
it
was
a
bitterly
cold
day
and
as
for
the
latter
of
course
i
could
not
hope
to
enter
one
of
them
so
i
kept
on
towards
the
station
and
presently
without
let
or
hindrance
i
reached
one
of
the
platforms
le
mans
being
an
important
junction
its
station
was
very
large
in
some
respects
quite
monumental
the
principal
part
was
roofed
with
glass
and
suggested
charing
cross
i
do
not
remember
exactly
the
number
of
lines
of
metals
running
through
it
but
i
think
there
must
have
been
four
or
five
there
were
two
trains
waiting
there
one
of
them
which
was
largely
composed
of
passenger
carriages
being
crammed
with
soldiers
i
tried
to
get
into
one
carriage
but
was
fiercely
repulsed
so
going
to
the
rear
of
this
train
i
crossed
to
another
platform
where
the
second
train
was
this
was
made
up
of
passenger
coaches
and
vans
i
scrambled
into
one
of
the
latter
which
was
open
there
were
a
number
of
inside
it
but
there
was
at
least
standing
room
for
several
persons
two
railway
men
and
two
or
three
soldiers
were
already
there
one
of
the
former
helped
me
to
get
in
i
had
be
it
said
a
appearance
for
my
grey
frieze
coat
was
frogged
and
besides
what
was
more
important
i
wore
the
armlet
given
me
at
the
time
when
i
followed
gougeard
column
almost
immediately
afterwards
the
train
full
of
soldiers
got
away
the
cannonade
was
now
very
loud
and
the
glass
roof
above
us
constantly
vibrated
some
minutes
elapsed
whilst
we
exchanged
impressions
then
all
at
once
a
railway
official
it
may
have
been
piquet
himself
rushed
along
the
platform
in
the
direction
of
the
engine
shouting
as
he
went
dépêchez
dépêchez
at
the
same
moment
a
stray
artilleryman
was
seen
hastening
towards
us
but
suddenly
there
came
a
terrific
crash
of
glass
a
shell
burst
through
the
roof
and
exploded
and
the
unlucky
artilleryman
fell
on
the
platform
evidently
severely
wounded
we
were
already
in
motion
however
and
the
line
being
dear
we
got
fairly
swiftly
across
the
viaduct
spanning
the
sarthe
this
placed
us
beyond
the
reach
of
the
enemy
and
we
then
slowed
down
one
or
two
more
trains
were
got
away
after
ours
the
last
one
i
believe
being
vainly
assailed
by
some
uhlans
before
it
had
crossed
the
viaduct
the
latter
ought
then
to
have
been
blown
up
but
an
attempt
to
do
so
proved
ineffectual
we
went
on
very
slowly
on
account
of
the
many
trains
in
front
of
us
every
now
and
again
too
there
came
a
wearisome
stop
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
it
was
in
vain
that
we
beat
the
tattoo
with
our
feet
in
the
hope
of
thereby
warming
them
the
men
with
me
were
also
desperately
hungry
and
complained
of
it
so
bitterly
and
so
frequently
that
at
last
i
could
not
refrain
from
producing
a
little
bread
and
meat
which
i
had
secured
at
le
mans
and
sharing
it
with
them
but
it
merely
meant
a
bite
for
each
of
us
however
on
stopping
at
last
at
conlie
station
some
sixteen
or
seventeen
miles
from
le
mans
we
all
hastily
scrambled
out
of
the
train
rushed
into
a
little
inn
and
almost
fought
like
wild
beasts
for
scraps
of
food
then
on
we
went
once
more
still
very
slowly
still
stopping
again
and
again
sometimes
for
an
hour
at
a
stretch
until
half
numbed
by
the
cold
weary
of
stamping
our
feet
and
still
ravenous
we
reached
the
little
town
of
which
is
not
more
than
eight
or
nine
miles
from
conlie
at
sillé
i
secured
a
tiny
room
at
the
crowded
hôtel
de
la
croix
a
hostelry
which
was
already
invaded
by
officers
soldiers
railway
officials
and
others
who
had
quitted
le
mans
before
i
had
managed
to
do
so
my
comparatively
youthful
appearance
won
for
me
however
the
good
favour
of
the
buxom
landlady
who
after
repeatedly
declaring
to
other
applicants
that
she
had
not
a
corner
left
in
the
whole
house
took
me
aside
and
said
in
an
undertone
listen
i
will
put
you
in
a
little
upstairs
i
will
show
you
the
way
by
and
by
but
tell
anybody
and
she
added
compassionately
pauvre
you
look
frozen
go
into
the
kitchen
there
is
a
good
fire
there
and
you
will
get
something
to
eat
truth
to
tell
the
larder
was
nearly
empty
but
i
secured
a
little
cheese
and
some
bread
and
some
very
indifferent
wine
which
however
in
my
then
condition
seemed
to
me
to
be
nectar
i
helped
myself
to
a
bowl
i
remember
and
poured
about
a
pint
of
wine
into
it
so
as
to
soak
my
bread
which
was
stale
and
hard
toasting
my
feet
at
the
fire
whilst
i
regaled
myself
with
that
improvised
i
soon
felt
warm
and
inspirited
once
more
hardship
sits
on
one
but
lightly
when
one
is
only
seventeen
years
of
age
and
stirred
by
early
ambition
all
the
world
then
lay
before
me
like
mine
oyster
to
be
opened
by
either
sword
or
pen
at
a
later
hour
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
guttering
candle
in
the
little
upstairs
i
wrote
as
best
i
could
an
account
of
the
recent
fighting
and
the
loss
of
le
mans
and
early
on
the
following
morning
i
prevailed
on
a
who
was
going
to
rennes
to
post
my
packet
there
in
order
that
it
might
be
forwarded
to
england
saint
malo
the
article
appeared
in
the
mall
filling
a
page
of
that
journal
and
whatever
its
imperfections
may
have
been
it
was
undoubtedly
the
first
detailed
account
of
the
battle
of
le
mans
from
the
french
side
to
appear
in
the
english
press
it
so
happened
indeed
that
the
other
correspondents
with
the
french
forces
including
my
cousin
montague
vizetelly
of
daily
lingered
at
le
mans
until
it
was
too
late
for
them
to
leave
the
town
the
germans
having
effected
their
entry
german
detachments
soon
started
in
pursuit
of
the
retreating
army
of
the
loire
chanzy
as
previously
mentioned
modified
his
plans
in
accordance
with
gambetta
views
on
the
evening
of
january
the
new
orders
were
that
the
army
corps
should
retreat
on
laval
by
way
of
chassillé
and
saint
that
the
after
passing
conlie
should
come
down
to
sainte
suzanne
and
that
the
should
proceed
from
conlie
to
there
were
several
engagements
during
the
retreat
already
on
the
before
the
corps
could
modify
its
original
line
of
march
it
had
to
fight
at
ballon
north
of
le
mans
on
the
next
day
one
of
its
detachments
composed
of
mobilisés
of
the
mayenne
was
attacked
at
and
hastily
fell
back
leaving
men
in
the
hands
of
the
germans
who
on
their
side
lost
only
those
french
soldiers
who
retreated
by
way
of
conlie
partially
pillaged
the
abandoned
stores
there
a
battalion
of
mobiles
on
passing
that
way
provided
themselves
with
new
trousers
coats
boots
and
blankets
besides
carrying
off
a
quantity
of
bread
sugar
and
other
provisions
these
things
were
at
least
saved
from
the
germans
who
on
reaching
the
abandoned
camp
found
there
a
quantity
of
military
five
million
cartridges
cases
of
biscuits
and
extract
of
meat
barrels
of
a
score
of
sacks
of
rice
and
puncheons
of
brandy
on
january
the
corps
under
jaurès
reached
and
was
there
attacked
by
the
advanced
guard
of
the
german
corps
under
the
grand
duke
of
mecklenburg
the
french
offered
a
good
resistance
however
and
the
germans
retreated
on
conlie
i
myself
had
managed
to
leave
sillé
the
previous
afternoon
but
such
was
the
block
on
the
line
that
our
train
could
get
no
farther
than
voutré
a
village
of
about
a
thousand
souls
railway
travelling
seeming
an
impossibility
i
prevailed
on
a
farmer
to
give
me
a
lift
as
far
as
sainte
suzanne
whence
i
hoped
to
cut
across
country
in
the
direction
of
laval
sainte
suzanne
is
an
ancient
and
picturesque
little
town
which
in
those
days
still
had
a
rampart
and
the
ruins
of
an
early
feudal
castle
i
supped
and
slept
at
an
inn
there
and
was
told
in
the
morning
january
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
go
southward
towards
saint
where
i
should
strike
the
direct
highway
to
laval
and
might
also
be
able
to
procure
a
conveyance
i
did
not
then
know
the
exact
retreating
orders
i
hoped
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
all
the
troops
and
waggons
encumbering
the
roads
but
in
this
i
was
doomed
to
disappointment
for
at
saint
jean
i
fell
in
with
them
again
that
day
a
part
of
the
of
the
corps
jauréguiberry
that
is
a
detachment
of
men
with
a
squadron
of
cavalry
under
general
le
bouëdec
had
been
driven
out
of
chassillé
by
the
german
cavalry
under
general
von
schmidt
this
had
accelerated
the
french
retreat
which
continued
in
the
greatest
confusion
all
the
men
hastening
precipitately
towards
saint
jean
where
after
getting
the
bulk
of
his
force
on
to
the
heights
across
the
river
erve
which
here
intersects
the
highway
jauréguiberry
resolved
on
attempting
to
check
the
enemy
pursuit
though
the
condition
of
most
of
the
men
was
lamentable
vigorous
defensive
preparations
were
made
on
the
night
of
the
and
the
early
morning
of
the
following
day
on
the
low
ground
near
the
village
and
the
river
trees
were
felled
and
roads
were
barricaded
while
on
the
slopes
batteries
were
disposed
behind
hedges
in
which
embrasures
were
cut
the
force
was
i
believe
chiefly
composed
of
cavalry
and
artillery
the
latter
was
already
firing
at
us
when
jauréguiberry
rode
along
our
lines
a
shell
exploded
near
him
and
some
splinters
of
the
projectile
struck
his
horse
in
the
neck
inflicting
a
ghastly
gaping
wound
the
poor
beast
however
did
not
fall
immediately
but
galloped
on
frantically
for
more
than
a
score
of
yards
then
suddenly
reared
and
after
doing
so
came
down
all
of
a
heap
upon
the
snow
however
the
admiral
who
was
a
good
horseman
speedily
disengaged
himself
and
turned
to
secure
another
mount
when
he
perceived
that
colonel
beraud
his
chief
of
staff
who
had
been
riding
behind
him
had
been
wounded
by
the
same
shell
and
had
fallen
from
his
horse
i
saw
the
colonel
being
carried
to
a
neighbouring
farmhouse
and
was
afterwards
told
that
he
had
died
there
the
engagement
had
no
very
decisive
result
but
schmidt
fell
back
to
the
road
connecting
sainte
suzanne
with
whilst
we
withdrew
towards
about
halfway
between
saint
jean
and
laval
during
the
fight
however
whilst
the
artillery
duel
was
in
progress
quite
half
of
jauréguiberry
men
had
taken
themselves
off
without
waiting
for
orders
i
believe
that
on
the
night
of
january
he
could
not
have
mustered
more
than
men
for
action
yet
only
two
days
previously
he
had
had
nearly
three
times
that
number
with
him
nevertheless
much
might
be
pleaded
for
the
men
the
weather
was
still
bitterly
cold
snow
lay
everywhere
little
or
no
food
could
be
obtained
the
commissariat
refraining
from
requisitioning
cattle
at
the
farms
for
all
through
the
departments
for
mayenne
and
was
raging
hungry
emaciated
faint
coughing
incessantly
at
times
affected
with
the
men
limped
or
trudged
on
despairingly
their
boots
were
often
in
a
most
wretched
condition
some
wore
sabots
others
as
i
said
once
before
merely
had
rags
around
their
poor
feet
and
the
roads
were
obstructed
by
guns
vans
waggons
vehicles
of
all
kinds
sometimes
an
axle
had
broken
sometimes
a
horse
had
fallen
dead
on
the
snow
in
any
case
one
or
another
conveyance
had
come
to
a
standstill
and
prevented
others
from
pursuing
their
route
i
recollect
seeing
hungry
men
cutting
steaks
from
the
flanks
of
the
dead
beasts
sometimes
devouring
the
horseflesh
raw
at
others
taking
it
to
some
cottage
where
the
avaricious
peasants
who
refused
to
part
with
a
scrap
of
food
at
least
had
to
let
these
cold
and
hungry
men
warm
themselves
at
a
fire
and
toast
their
horseflesh
before
it
at
one
halt
three
soldiers
knocked
a
peasant
down
because
he
vowed
that
he
could
not
even
give
them
a
pinch
of
salt
that
done
they
rifled
his
cupboards
and
ate
all
they
could
find
experience
had
taught
me
a
lesson
i
had
filled
my
pockets
with
ham
bread
eggs
and
other
things
before
leaving
sainte
suzanne
i
had
also
obtained
a
meal
at
saint
jean
and
secured
some
brandy
there
and
i
ate
and
drank
sparingly
and
surreptitiously
whilst
i
went
on
overtaking
one
after
another
batch
of
weary
soldiers
however
the
distance
between
saint
jean
and
laval
is
not
very
great
judging
by
the
map
it
is
a
matter
of
some
miles
at
the
utmost
moreover
i
walked
only
half
the
distance
the
troops
moved
so
slowly
that
i
reached
long
before
them
and
there
induced
a
man
to
drive
me
to
laval
i
was
there
on
the
afternoon
of
january
and
as
from
this
point
trains
were
still
running
westward
i
reached
saint
servan
on
the
following
day
thus
i
slipped
through
to
my
goal
thereby
justifying
the
nickname
of
the
eel
which
some
of
my
young
french
friends
had
bestowed
on
me
a
day
or
two
previously
my
father
had
returned
from
england
and
i
found
him
with
my
stepmother
he
became
very
much
interested
in
my
story
and
talked
of
going
to
laval
himself
further
important
developments
might
soon
occur
the
germans
might
push
on
to
chanzy
new
base
and
i
felt
that
i
also
ought
to
go
back
the
life
i
had
been
leading
either
makes
or
mars
a
man
physically
personally
i
believe
that
it
did
me
a
world
of
good
at
all
events
it
was
settled
that
my
father
and
myself
should
go
to
laval
together
we
started
a
couple
of
days
later
and
managed
to
travel
by
rail
as
far
as
rennes
but
from
that
point
to
laval
the
line
was
now
very
badly
blocked
and
so
we
hired
a
closed
vehicle
a
ramshackle
affair
drawn
by
two
scraggy
breton
nags
the
main
roads
being
still
crowded
with
troops
artillery
and
baggage
waggons
and
other
impedimenta
were
often
impassable
and
so
we
proceeded
by
devious
ways
amidst
which
our
driver
lost
himself
in
such
wise
that
at
night
we
had
to
seek
a
shelter
at
the
famous
chateau
des
bochers
immortalized
by
mme
de
sévigné
and
replete
with
precious
portraits
of
herself
her
own
and
her
husband
families
in
addition
to
a
quantity
of
beautiful
furniture
dating
from
her
time
it
took
us
i
think
altogether
two
days
to
reach
laval
where
after
securing
accommodation
at
one
of
the
hotels
we
went
out
in
search
of
news
having
heard
none
since
we
had
started
on
our
journey
perceiving
a
newspaper
shop
we
entered
it
and
my
father
insisted
on
purchasing
a
copy
of
virtually
every
journal
which
was
on
sale
there
unfortunately
for
us
this
seemed
highly
suspicious
to
a
local
national
guard
who
was
in
the
shop
and
when
we
left
it
he
followed
us
my
father
had
just
then
begun
to
speak
to
me
in
english
and
at
the
sound
of
a
foreign
tongue
the
suspicions
increased
so
he
drew
nearer
and
demanded
to
know
who
and
what
we
were
i
replied
that
we
were
english
and
that
i
had
previously
been
authorised
to
accompany
the
army
as
a
newspaper
correspondent
my
statements
however
were
received
with
incredulity
by
this
suspicious
individual
who
after
one
or
two
further
inquiries
requested
us
to
accompany
him
to
a
standing
near
one
of
the
bridges
thrown
over
the
river
mayenne
thither
we
went
followed
by
several
people
who
had
assembled
during
our
parley
and
found
ourselves
before
a
lieutenant
of
gendarmes
on
the
charge
of
being
german
spies
our
denouncer
was
most
positive
on
the
point
had
we
not
bought
at
least
a
dozen
newspapers
why
a
dozen
when
sensible
people
would
have
been
satisfied
with
one
such
extensive
purchases
must
surely
have
been
prompted
by
some
sinister
motive
besides
he
had
heard
us
conversing
in
german
english
indeed
no
no
he
was
certain
that
we
had
spoken
german
and
was
equally
certain
of
our
guilt
the
lieutenant
looked
grave
and
my
explanations
did
not
quite
satisfy
him
the
predicament
was
the
more
awkward
as
although
my
father
was
provided
with
a
british
passport
i
had
somehow
left
my
precious
military
permit
at
saint
servan
further
my
father
carried
with
him
some
documents
which
might
have
been
deemed
incriminating
they
were
indeed
signed
by
various
german
generals
which
had
been
used
by
us
conjointly
while
passing
through
the
german
lines
after
making
our
way
out
of
paris
in
november
as
for
my
correspondent
permit
signed
some
time
previously
by
the
chief
of
the
staff
i
had
been
unable
to
find
it
when
examining
my
papers
on
our
way
to
laval
but
had
consoled
myself
with
the
thought
that
i
might
get
it
replaced
at
headquarters
the
armlet
which
had
repeatedly
proved
so
useful
to
me
enabling
me
to
come
and
go
without
much
interference
was
at
our
hotel
in
a
bag
we
had
brought
with
us
could
i
have
shown
it
to
the
lieutenant
he
might
have
ordered
our
release
as
it
happened
he
decided
to
send
us
to
the
provost
marshal
i
was
not
greatly
put
out
by
that
command
for
i
remembered
the
officer
in
question
or
thought
i
did
and
felt
convinced
that
everything
would
speedily
be
set
right
we
started
off
in
the
charge
of
a
a
corporal
of
gendarmes
and
four
men
our
denouncer
following
closely
at
our
heels
my
father
at
once
pointed
out
to
me
that
the
brigadier
and
one
of
the
men
wore
silver
medals
bearing
the
effigy
of
queen
victoria
so
i
said
to
the
former
you
were
in
the
crimea
you
are
wearing
our
queen
medal
yes
he
replied
i
gained
that
at
the
alma
and
your
comrade
he
won
his
at
the
tohernaya
i
dare
say
you
would
have
been
glad
if
french
and
english
had
fought
side
by
side
in
this
war
i
added
perhaps
they
ought
to
have
done
so
the
english
certainly
owed
us
a
coup
de
instead
of
which
they
have
only
sold
us
horses
and
bad
boots
i
agreed
that
there
had
been
some
instances
of
the
kind
a
few
more
words
passed
and
i
believe
that
the
brigadier
became
convinced
of
our
english
nationality
but
as
his
orders
were
to
take
us
to
the
provost
thither
we
were
bound
to
go
an
ever
increasing
crowd
followed
shopkeepers
and
other
folk
came
to
their
doors
and
windows
and
the
words
they
are
spies
german
spies
rang
out
repeatedly
exciting
the
crowd
and
rendering
it
more
and
more
hostile
for
a
while
we
followed
a
quay
with
granite
parapets
below
which
flowed
the
mayenne
laden
with
drifting
ice
all
at
once
however
i
perceived
on
our
left
a
large
square
where
about
a
hundred
men
of
the
laval
national
guard
were
being
exercised
they
saw
us
appear
with
our
escort
they
saw
the
crowd
which
followed
us
and
they
heard
the
cries
spies
german
spies
forthwith
with
that
disregard
for
discipline
which
among
the
french
was
so
characteristic
of
the
period
they
broke
their
ranks
and
ran
towards
us
we
were
only
able
to
take
a
few
more
steps
in
vain
did
the
gendarmes
try
to
force
a
way
through
the
excited
mob
we
were
surrounded
by
angry
scowling
vociferating
men
imprecations
burst
forth
fists
were
clenched
arms
were
waved
rifles
were
shaken
the
unruly
national
guards
being
the
most
eager
of
all
to
denounce
and
threaten
us
down
with
the
spies
they
shouted
down
with
the
german
pigs
give
them
to
us
let
us
shoot
them
a
very
threatening
rush
ensued
and
i
was
almost
carried
off
my
feet
but
in
another
moment
i
found
myself
against
the
parapet
of
the
quay
with
my
father
beside
me
and
the
icy
river
in
the
rear
in
front
of
us
stood
the
brigadier
and
his
four
men
guarding
us
from
the
angry
citizens
of
laval
hand
them
over
to
us
we
will
settle
their
affair
shouted
an
excited
national
guard
you
know
that
they
are
spies
brigadier
i
know
that
i
have
my
orders
growled
the
veteran
i
am
taking
them
to
the
provost
it
is
for
him
to
decide
that
is
too
much
ceremony
was
the
retort
let
us
shoot
them
but
they
are
not
worth
a
cartridge
shouted
another
man
throw
them
into
the
river
that
ominous
cry
was
taken
up
yes
yes
to
the
river
with
them
then
came
another
rush
one
so
extremely
violent
that
our
case
seemed
desperate
but
the
brigadier
and
his
men
had
managed
to
fix
bayonets
during
the
brief
parley
and
on
the
mob
being
confronted
by
five
blades
of
glistening
steel
its
savage
eagerness
abated
moreover
the
old
brigadier
behaved
magnificently
keep
back
cried
he
i
have
my
orders
you
will
have
to
settle
me
before
you
take
my
prisoners
just
then
i
caught
the
eye
of
one
of
the
national
guards
who
was
shaking
his
fist
at
us
and
i
said
to
him
you
are
quite
mistaken
we
are
not
germans
but
english
yes
yes
my
father
exclaimed
while
some
of
the
men
in
the
crowd
were
more
or
less
incredulously
repeating
that
statement
a
individual
whom
i
can
at
this
very
moment
still
picture
with
my
mind
eye
so
vividly
did
the
affair
impress
me
climbed
on
to
the
parapet
near
us
and
called
out
you
say
you
are
english
do
you
know
london
do
you
know
regent
street
do
you
know
the
soho
yes
yes
we
answered
quickly
you
know
the
square
what
name
is
the
there
why
the
alhambra
the
empire
let
me
add
did
not
exist
in
those
days
the
man
seemed
satisfied
i
think
they
are
english
he
said
to
his
friends
but
somebody
else
exclaimed
i
do
believe
it
one
of
them
is
wearing
a
german
hat
now
it
happened
that
my
father
had
returned
from
london
wearing
a
felt
hat
of
a
shape
which
was
then
somewhat
fashionable
there
and
which
curiously
enough
was
called
the
crown
prince
after
the
heir
to
the
prussian
throne
that
is
our
princess
royal
husband
subsequently
the
emperor
frederick
the
national
guard
who
spoke
a
little
english
wished
to
inspect
this
incriminating
hat
so
my
father
took
it
off
and
one
of
the
gendarmes
having
placed
it
on
his
bayonet
passed
it
to
the
man
on
the
parapet
when
the
latter
had
read
christy
london
on
the
lining
he
once
more
testified
in
our
favour
but
other
fellows
also
wished
to
examine
the
suspicious
headgear
and
it
passed
from
hand
to
hand
before
it
was
returned
to
my
father
in
a
more
or
less
damaged
condition
even
then
a
good
many
men
were
not
satisfied
respecting
our
nationality
but
during
that
incident
of
the
hat
a
laughable
one
to
me
nowadays
though
everything
looked
very
ugly
when
it
occurred
there
had
been
time
for
the
men
angry
passions
to
cool
to
a
considerable
extent
at
all
events
and
after
that
interlude
they
were
much
less
eager
to
inflict
on
us
the
summary
law
of
lynch
a
further
parley
ensued
and
eventually
the
gendarmes
who
still
stood
with
bayonets
crossed
in
front
of
us
were
authorized
by
decision
of
the
sovereign
people
to
take
us
to
the
provost
thither
we
went
then
amidst
a
perfect
procession
of
watchful
guards
and
civilians
directly
we
appeared
before
the
provost
i
realized
that
our
troubles
were
not
yet
over
some
changes
had
taken
place
during
the
retreat
and
either
the
officer
whom
i
remembered
having
seen
at
le
mans
that
is
colonel
mora
had
been
replaced
by
another
or
else
the
one
before
whom
we
now
appeared
was
not
the
but
only
the
provost
of
the
corps
at
all
events
he
was
a
complete
stranger
to
me
after
hearing
first
the
statements
of
the
brigadier
and
the
national
guard
who
had
denounced
us
and
who
had
kept
close
to
us
all
the
time
and
secondly
the
explanations
supplied
by
my
father
and
myself
he
said
to
me
if
you
had
a
staff
permit
to
follow
the
army
somebody
at
headquarters
must
be
able
to
identify
you
i
think
that
might
be
done
i
answered
by
feilding
who
as
you
must
know
accompanies
the
army
on
behalf
of
the
british
government
personally
i
am
known
to
several
officers
of
the
corps
general
gougeard
and
his
chief
of
staff
for
instance
and
also
to
some
of
the
at
headquarters
well
get
yourselves
identified
and
obtain
a
proper
said
the
provost
brigadier
you
are
to
take
these
men
to
headquarters
if
they
are
identified
there
you
will
let
them
go
if
not
take
them
to
the
château
the
prison
and
report
to
me
again
we
all
set
out
this
time
climbing
the
hilly
streets
of
old
laval
above
which
the
town
great
feudal
castle
reared
its
dark
round
keep
and
presently
we
came
to
the
local
college
formerly
an
ursuline
convent
where
chanzy
had
fixed
his
headquarters
in
one
of
the
large
were
several
officers
one
of
whom
immediately
recognized
me
he
laughed
when
he
heard
our
story
i
was
arrested
myself
the
other
day
he
said
because
i
was
heard
speaking
in
english
to
your
general
feilding
and
yet
i
was
in
uniform
as
i
am
now
the
gendarmes
were
promptly
dismissed
though
not
before
my
father
had
slipped
something
into
the
hand
of
the
old
brigadier
for
himself
and
his
comrades
their
firmness
had
saved
us
for
when
a
mob
passions
are
inflamed
by
patriotic
zeal
the
worst
may
happen
to
the
objects
of
its
wrath
a
proper
which
i
still
possess
was
prepared
by
an
on
duty
and
whilst
he
was
drafting
it
an
elderly
but
officer
entered
and
went
up
to
a
large
circular
stove
to
warm
himself
three
small
stars
still
glittered
faintly
on
his
faded
cap
and
six
rows
of
narrow
tarnished
gold
braid
ornamented
the
sleeves
of
his
somewhat
shabby
dolman
it
was
chanzy
himself
he
noticed
our
presence
and
our
case
was
explained
to
him
looking
at
me
keenly
he
said
i
think
i
have
seen
you
before
you
are
the
young
english
correspondent
who
was
allowed
to
make
some
sketches
at
are
you
not
yes
i
answered
saluting
you
gave
me
permission
through
i
think
monsieur
le
commandant
de
boisdeffre
he
nodded
pleasantly
as
we
withdrew
then
lapsed
into
a
thoughtful
attitude
out
we
went
down
through
old
laval
and
towards
the
new
town
my
father
carrying
the
in
his
hand
the
gendarmes
must
have
already
told
people
that
we
were
all
right
for
we
now
encountered
only
pleasant
faces
nevertheless
we
handed
the
to
one
party
of
national
guards
for
their
inspection
in
order
that
their
minds
might
be
quite
at
rest
that
occurred
outside
the
hospital
where
at
that
moment
i
little
imagined
that
a
young
englishman
a
volunteer
in
the
sixth
battalion
of
the
mobile
guards
army
corps
was
lying
invalided
by
a
chill
which
he
had
caught
during
an
ascent
in
our
army
balloon
with
gaston
tissandier
since
then
that
young
englishman
has
become
famous
as
viscount
kitchener
of
khartoum
but
the
national
guards
insisted
on
carrying
my
father
and
myself
to
the
chief
café
of
laval
they
would
take
no
refusal
in
genuine
french
fashion
they
were
all
anxiety
to
offer
some
amends
for
their
misplaced
patriotic
impulsiveness
that
afternoon
when
they
had
threatened
first
to
shoot
and
next
to
drown
us
in
lieu
thereof
they
now
deluged
us
with
punch
la
and
as
the
café
soon
became
crowded
with
other
folk
who
all
joined
our
party
there
ensued
a
scene
which
almost
suggested
that
some
glorious
victory
had
been
gained
at
last

invaded
and
unfortunate

interfered
with
there
a
painful
interest
attached
to
one
sight
which
we
witnessed
more
than
once
it
was
that
of
the
many
processions
of
deserters
whom
the
horse
gendarmerie
of
the
headquarters
staff
frequently
brought
into
the
town
the
whole
region
was
scoured
for
runaways
many
of
whom
were
found
in
the
villages
and
at
lonely
farms
they
had
generally
cast
off
their
uniform
and
put
on
blouses
but
the
peasantry
frequently
betrayed
them
particularly
as
they
seldom
if
ever
had
any
money
to
spend
in
bribes
apart
from
those
and
the
measures
of
all
kinds
which
chanzy
took
to
reorganise
his
army
little
of
immediate
import
occurred
at
laval
gambetta
had
been
there
and
had
then
departed
for
lille
in
order
to
ascertain
the
condition
of
faidherbe
army
of
the
north
the
german
pursuit
of
chanzy
forces
ceased
virtually
at
saint
there
was
just
another
little
skirmish
at
sainte
mélaine
but
that
was
all
i
should
add
that
on
january
the
germans
under
mecklenburg
secured
possession
of
alengon
chanty
original
objective
alter
an
ineffectual
resistance
offered
by
the
troops
under
commandant
lipowski
who
was
seconded
in
his
endeavours
by
young
antonin
dubost
then
prefect
of
the
orne
and
recently
president
of
the
french
senate
accordingly
my
father
and
i
returned
to
saint
servan
and
having
conjointly
prepared
some
articles
on
chanzy
retreat
and
present
circumstances
forwarded
them
to
london
for
the
mall
the
war
was
now
fast
drawing
to
an
end
i
have
hitherto
left
several
important
occurrences
unmentioned
being
unwilling
to
interrupt
my
narrative
of
the
fighting
at
le
mans
and
the
subsequent
retreat
i
feel
however
that
i
now
ought
to
glance
at
the
state
of
affairs
in
other
parts
of
france
i
have
just
mentioned
that
after
visiting
chanzy
at
laval
january
gambetta
repaired
to
lille
to
confer
with
faidherbe
let
us
see
then
what
the
latter
general
had
been
doing
he
was
no
longer
opposed
by
manteuffel
who
had
been
sent
to
the
east
of
france
in
the
hope
that
he
would
deal
more
effectually
than
werder
with
bourbaki
army
which
was
still
in
the
field
there
manteuffel
successor
in
the
north
was
general
von
goeben
with
whom
on
january
faidherbe
fought
an
engagement
at
vermand
followed
on
the
morrow
by
the
battle
of
saint
quentin
which
was
waged
for
seven
hours
amidst
thaw
and
fog
though
it
was
claimed
as
a
french
victory
it
was
not
one
the
germans
it
is
true
lost
men
but
the
french
killed
and
wounded
amounted
to
and
there
were
thousands
of
men
missing
the
germans
taking
some
prisoners
whilst
other
troops
disbanded
much
as
chanzy
men
disbanded
during
his
retreat
from
a
strategical
point
of
view
the
action
at
saint
quentin
was
indecisive
turning
to
eastern
france
bourbaki
fought
two
indecisive
engagements
near
villersexel
of
vesoul
on
january
and
and
claimed
the
victory
on
these
occasions
on
january
came
another
engagement
at
arcey
which
he
also
claimed
as
a
success
being
congratulated
upon
it
by
gambetta
the
weather
was
most
severe
in
the
region
of
his
operations
and
the
sufferings
of
his
men
were
quite
as
great
as
if
not
greater
than
those
of
chanzy
troops
there
were
nights
when
men
lay
down
to
sleep
and
never
awoke
again
on
january
and
there
was
a
succession
of
engagements
on
the
lisaine
known
collectively
as
the
battle
of
héricourt
these
actions
resulted
in
bourbaki
retreat
southward
towards
besançon
where
for
the
moment
we
will
leave
him
in
order
to
consider
the
position
of
paris
at
this
juncture
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
day
of
the
capital
surrender
had
been
fast
approaching
paris
actually
fell
because
its
supply
of
food
was
virtually
exhausted
on
january
it
became
necessary
to
ration
the
bread
now
a
dark
sticky
compound
which
included
such
ingredients
as
bran
starch
rice
barley
vermicelli
and
about
ten
ounces
was
allotted
per
diem
to
each
adult
children
under
five
years
of
age
receiving
half
that
quantity
but
the
of
the
city
was
also
a
contributory
cause
of
the
capitulation
in
november
there
were
deaths
among
the
population
against
in
november
the
of
december
rose
to
against
in
december
the
previous
year
in
january
between
sixty
and
seventy
persons
died
from
every
day
bronchitis
and
pneumonia
made
an
number
of
victims
from
january
to
january
the
mortality
rose
to
no
less
than
from
the
latter
date
until
january
the
day
of
the
capitulation
the
figures
were
whereas
in
normal
times
they
had
never
been
more
than
in
any
week
among
the
troops
the
position
was
going
from
bad
to
worse
thousands
of
men
were
in
the
hospitals
and
thousands
contrived
to
desert
and
hide
themselves
in
the
city
out
of
linesmen
there
were
on
january
no
fewer
than
absentees
while
units
were
absent
from
the
mobile
guard
which
on
paper
numbered
briefly
one
man
out
of
every
five
was
either
a
patient
or
a
deserter
as
for
the
german
bombardment
this
had
some
moral
but
very
little
material
effect
apart
from
the
damage
done
to
buildings
it
killed
as
i
previously
said
about
one
hundred
and
wounded
about
two
hundred
persons
the
government
now
had
little
if
any
confidence
in
the
utility
of
any
further
sorties
nevertheless
as
the
extremist
newspapers
still
clamoured
for
one
it
was
eventually
decided
to
attack
the
german
positions
across
the
seine
on
the
west
of
the
city
this
sortie
commonly
called
that
of
buzenval
took
place
on
january
the
day
after
king
william
of
prussia
had
been
proclaimed
german
emperor
in
louis
xiv
hall
of
mirrors
at
versailles
the
decision
to
raise
the
king
to
the
imperial
dignity
had
been
arrived
at
on
january
without
doubt
the
buzenval
sortie
was
devised
chiefly
in
order
to
give
the
national
guard
the
constantly
demanded
opportunity
and
satisfaction
of
being
led
against
the
germans
trochu
who
assumed
chief
command
establishing
himself
at
the
fort
of
mont
valérien
divided
his
forces
into
three
columns
led
by
generals
vinoy
bellemare
and
ducrot
the
first
the
left
wing
comprised
men
including
national
guards
the
second
the
central
column
men
including
guards
and
the
third
the
right
wing
men
among
whom
were
no
fewer
than
guards
thus
the
total
force
was
about
the
national
guards
representing
about
a
third
of
that
number
each
column
had
with
it
ten
batteries
representing
for
the
entire
force
guns
the
french
front
however
extended
over
a
distance
of
nearly
four
miles
and
the
army
real
strength
was
thereby
diminished
there
was
some
fairly
desperate
fighting
at
saint
cloud
montretout
and
longboyau
but
the
french
were
driven
back
after
losing
men
mostly
national
guards
whereas
the
german
losses
were
only
about
six
hundred
the
affair
caused
consternation
in
paris
particularly
as
several
prominent
men
had
fallen
in
the
ranks
of
the
national
guard
on
the
night
of
january
some
extremists
forced
their
way
into
the
prison
of
mazas
and
delivered
some
of
their
friends
who
had
been
shut
up
there
since
the
rising
of
october
on
the
morrow
january
there
was
a
demonstration
and
an
affray
on
the
place
de
de
ville
shots
being
exchanged
with
the
result
that
people
were
killed
and
wounded
the
government
gained
the
day
however
and
retaliated
by
closing
the
revolutionary
clubs
and
suppressing
some
extremist
newspapers
but
four
hours
later
trochu
resigned
his
position
as
military
governor
of
paris
in
which
he
was
replaced
by
general
vinoy
only
retaining
the
presidency
of
the
government
another
important
incident
had
occurred
on
the
very
evening
after
the
insurrection
jules
favre
the
foreign
minister
had
then
forwarded
a
letter
to
prince
bismarck
the
government
first
idea
had
been
merely
to
surrender
that
is
to
open
the
and
let
the
germans
enter
at
their
peril
it
did
not
wish
to
negotiate
or
sign
any
capitulation
jules
favre
indicated
as
much
when
writing
to
bismarck
and
certainly
the
proposed
course
might
have
placed
the
germans
with
the
eyes
of
the
world
fixed
upon
them
in
a
difficult
position
but
favre
was
no
match
for
the
great
prussian
statesman
formal
negotiations
were
soon
opened
and
bismarck
so
contrived
affairs
that
as
gambetta
subsequently
and
rightly
complained
the
convention
which
favre
signed
applied
far
more
to
france
as
a
whole
than
to
paris
itself
in
regard
to
the
city
the
chief
conditions
were
that
a
war
indemnity
of
should
be
paid
that
the
forts
round
the
city
should
be
occupied
by
the
germans
that
the
garrison
line
mobile
guard
and
naval
contingent
altogether
about
men
should
become
prisoners
of
war
and
that
the
armament
fortress
guns
and
field
pieces
should
be
surrendered
as
well
as
the
large
stores
of
ammunition
on
the
other
hand
a
force
of
men
was
left
to
the
french
government
for
police
duty
in
the
city
and
the
national
guards
were
at
favre
urgent
but
foolish
request
allowed
to
retain
their
arms
further
the
city
was
to
be
provisioned
in
regard
to
france
generally
arrangements
were
made
for
an
armistice
of
days
duration
in
order
to
allow
of
the
election
of
a
national
assembly
to
treat
for
peace
in
these
arrangements
favre
and
vinoy
the
new
governor
of
paris
were
by
bismarck
and
moltke
they
were
largely
ignorant
of
the
real
position
in
the
provinces
and
consented
to
very
disadvantageous
terms
in
regard
to
the
lines
which
the
germans
and
the
french
should
respectively
occupy
during
the
armistice
period
moreover
although
it
was
agreed
that
hostilities
should
cease
on
most
points
no
such
stipulation
was
made
respecting
the
east
of
france
where
both
bourbaki
and
garibaldi
were
in
the
field
the
latter
had
achieved
some
slight
successes
near
dijon
on
january
and
but
on
february
that
is
two
days
after
the
signing
of
the
armistice
the
garibaldians
were
once
more
driven
out
of
the
burgundian
capital
that
however
was
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
what
befell
bourbaki
unfortunate
army
manteuffel
having
compelled
it
to
retreat
from
besançon
to
pontarlier
it
was
next
forced
to
withdraw
into
switzerland
before
this
happened
bourbaki
attempted
his
life
neutral
territory
where
it
was
necessarily
disarmed
by
the
swiss
authorities
in
order
to
escape
either
capture
or
annihilation
by
the
germans
the
latter
took
some
prisoners
before
the
other
men
about
in
number
succeeded
in
crossing
the
swiss
frontier
a
portion
of
the
army
was
saved
however
by
general
billot
with
regard
to
the
position
elsewhere
longwy
i
should
mention
surrendered
three
days
before
the
capitulation
of
paris
but
belfort
prolonged
its
resistance
until
february
when
all
other
hostilities
had
ceased
its
garrison
so
gallantly
commanded
by
colonel
was
accorded
the
honours
of
war
as
i
wrote
in
my
book
republican
france
the
country
generally
was
weary
of
the
long
struggle
and
only
gambetta
freycinet
and
a
few
military
men
such
as
chanzy
and
faidherbe
were
in
favour
of
prolonging
it
from
the
declaration
of
war
on
july
to
the
capitulation
of
paris
and
the
armistice
on
january
the
contest
had
lasted
weeks
seven
of
those
weeks
had
sufficed
to
overthrow
the
second
empire
but
only
after
another
weeks
had
the
third
republic
laid
down
her
arms
whatever
may
have
been
the
blunders
of
the
national
defence
it
at
least
saved
the
honour
of
france
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
the
position
could
have
been
retrieved
had
the
war
been
prolonged
though
undoubtedly
the
country
was
still
possessed
of
many
resources
in
republican
france
i
gave
a
number
of
figures
which
showed
that
over
men
could
have
been
brought
into
action
almost
immediately
and
that
another
could
afterwards
have
been
provided
on
february
when
chanzy
had
largely
reorganized
his
army
he
alone
had
under
his
orders
officers
and
men
with
guns
that
careful
and
distinguished
french
military
historian
pierre
lehautcourt
places
however
the
other
resources
of
france
at
even
a
higher
figure
than
i
did
he
also
points
out
rightly
enough
that
although
so
large
a
part
of
france
was
invaded
the
uninvaded
territory
was
of
greater
extent
and
inhabited
by
millions
of
people
he
estimates
the
total
available
artillery
on
the
french
side
at
guns
each
with
an
average
allowance
of
projectiles
in
addition
there
were
guns
awaiting
projectiles
he
tells
us
that
the
french
ordnance
factories
were
at
this
period
turning
out
on
an
average
chassepots
every
month
and
delivering
two
million
cartridges
every
day
whilst
other
large
supplies
of
weapons
and
ammunition
were
constantly
arriving
from
abroad
on
the
other
hand
there
was
certainly
a
scarcity
of
horses
the
mortality
of
which
in
this
war
as
in
all
others
was
very
great
chanzy
only
disposed
of
and
the
remount
service
could
only
supply
another
however
additional
animals
might
doubtless
have
been
found
in
various
parts
of
france
or
procured
from
abroad
but
material
resources
however
great
they
may
be
are
of
little
avail
when
a
nation
has
practically
lost
heart
in
spite
moreover
of
all
the
efforts
of
commanding
officers
insubordination
was
rampant
among
the
troops
in
the
field
there
had
been
so
many
defeats
so
many
retreats
that
they
had
lost
all
confidence
in
their
generals
during
the
period
of
the
armistice
desertions
were
still
numerous
i
may
add
that
if
at
the
expiration
of
the
armistice
the
struggle
had
been
renewed
chanzy
plan
which
received
approval
at
a
secret
military
and
government
council
held
in
paris
whither
he
repaired
early
in
february
was
to
place
general
de
colomb
at
the
head
of
a
strong
force
for
the
defence
of
brittany
whilst
he
chanzy
would
with
his
own
army
cross
the
loire
and
defend
southern
france
directly
news
arrived
that
an
armistice
had
been
signed
and
that
paris
was
once
more
open
my
father
arranged
to
return
there
accompanied
by
myself
and
my
younger
brother
arthur
vizetelly
we
took
with
us
i
remember
a
plentiful
supply
of
poultry
and
other
edibles
for
distribution
among
the
friends
who
had
been
suffering
from
the
scarcity
of
provisions
during
the
latter
days
of
the
siege
the
elections
for
the
new
national
assembly
were
just
over
nearly
all
of
the
deputies
returned
for
paris
being
republicans
though
throughout
the
rest
of
france
legitimist
and
orleanist
candidates
were
generally
successful
i
remember
that
just
before
i
left
saint
servan
one
of
our
tradesmen
an
enthusiastic
royalist
said
to
me
we
shall
have
a
king
on
the
throne
by
the
time
you
come
back
to
see
us
in
the
summer
at
that
moment
it
certainly
seemed
as
if
such
would
be
the
case
as
for
the
empire
one
could
only
regard
it
as
dead
there
were
i
think
merely
five
recognized
bonapartist
members
in
the
whole
of
the
new
national
assembly
and
most
of
them
came
from
corsica
thus
it
was
by
an
almost
unanimous
vote
that
the
assembly
declared
napoleon
iii
and
his
dynasty
to
be
responsible
for
the
invasion
ruin
and
dismemberment
of
france
the
assembly
having
called
thiers
to
the
position
of
chief
of
the
executive
power
peace
negotiations
ensued
between
him
and
bismarck
they
began
on
february
thiers
being
assisted
by
jules
favre
who
retained
the
position
of
minister
of
foreign
affairs
mainly
because
nobody
else
would
take
it
and
append
his
signature
to
a
treaty
which
was
bound
to
be
disastrous
for
the
country
the
chief
conditions
of
that
treaty
will
be
remembered
germany
was
to
annex
to
receive
a
war
indemnity
of
two
hundred
million
pounds
sterling
with
interest
in
addition
and
secure
commercially
most
favoured
nation
treatment
from
france
the
preliminaries
were
signed
on
february
and
accepted
by
the
national
assembly
on
march
but
the
actual
treaty
of
frankfort
was
not
signed
and
ratified
until
the
ensuing
month
of
may
paris
presented
a
sorry
spectacle
during
the
weeks
which
followed
the
armistice
there
was
no
work
for
the
thousands
of
artisans
who
had
become
national
guards
during
the
siege
their
allowance
as
such
was
prolonged
in
order
that
they
might
at
least
have
some
means
of
subsistence
but
the
unrest
was
general
by
the
side
of
the
universal
hatred
of
the
germans
which
was
displayed
on
all
sides
even
finding
vent
in
the
notices
set
up
in
the
to
the
effect
that
no
germans
need
apply
there
one
observed
a
very
bitter
feeling
towards
the
new
government
thiers
had
been
an
orleanist
all
his
life
and
among
the
paris
there
was
a
general
feeling
that
the
national
assembly
would
give
france
a
king
this
feeling
tended
to
bring
about
the
subsequent
bloody
insurrection
of
the
commune
but
as
i
wrote
in
republican
france
it
was
precisely
the
commune
which
gave
the
french
royalists
a
chance
it
placed
a
weapon
in
their
hands
and
enabled
them
to
say
you
see
by
that
insurrection
by
all
those
terrible
excesses
what
a
republic
implies
order
quietude
fruitful
work
are
only
possible
under
a
monarchy
as
we
know
however
the
efforts
of
the
royalists
were
defeated
in
part
by
the
obstinacy
of
their
candidate
the
comte
de
chambord
and
in
part
by
the
good
behaviour
of
the
republicans
generally
as
counselled
both
by
thiers
and
by
gambetta
on
march
the
very
day
when
the
national
assembly
ratified
the
preliminaries
of
peace
at
bordeaux
the
germans
made
their
triumphal
entry
into
paris
four
or
five
days
previously
my
father
had
sent
me
on
a
special
mission
to
bordeaux
and
it
was
then
that
after
long
years
i
again
set
eyes
on
garibaldi
who
had
been
elected
as
a
french
deputy
but
who
resigned
his
seat
in
consequence
of
the
onerous
terms
of
peace
others
notably
gambetta
did
precisely
the
same
by
way
of
protesting
against
the
devil
treaty
however
i
was
back
in
paris
in
time
to
witness
the
german
entry
into
the
city
my
father
my
brother
arthur
and
myself
were
together
in
the
champs
elysées
on
that
historical
occasion
i
have
related
elsewhere
in
republican
france
how
a
number
of
women
of
the
paris
boulevards
were
whipped
in
the
champs
elysées
shrubberies
by
young
roughs
who
not
unnaturally
resented
the
shameless
overtures
made
by
these
women
to
the
german
soldiery
there
were
however
some
unfortunate
mistakes
that
day
as
for
instance
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
an
elderly
lady
who
merely
spoke
to
the
germans
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
some
information
respecting
her
son
then
still
a
prisoner
of
war
i
remember
also
that
archibald
forbes
was
knocked
down
and
kicked
for
returning
the
salute
of
the
crown
prince
of
saxony
some
of
the
english
correspondents
who
hurried
to
the
scene
removed
forbes
to
a
little
hotel
in
the
faubourg
honoré
for
he
had
really
been
hurt
by
that
savage
assault
though
it
did
not
prevent
him
from
penning
a
graphic
account
of
what
he
witnessed
on
that
momentous
day
the
german
entry
was
on
the
whole
fairly
imposing
as
a
military
display
but
the
was
very
bad
and
one
could
not
imagine
that
napoleon
entry
into
berlin
had
in
any
way
resembled
it
nor
could
it
be
said
to
have
equalled
the
entry
of
the
allied
sovereigns
into
paris
in
german
princelings
in
drawn
by
ponies
did
not
add
to
the
dignity
of
the
spectacle
moreover
both
the
crown
prince
of
saxony
and
the
crown
prince
of
germany
emperor
frederick
attended
it
in
virtually
an
manner
as
for
the
emperor
william
his
councillors
dissuaded
him
from
entering
the
city
for
fear
lest
there
should
be
trouble
there
i
believe
also
that
neither
bismarck
nor
moltke
attended
though
like
the
emperor
they
both
witnessed
the
preliminary
review
of
troops
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
the
german
occupation
was
limited
to
the
champs
elysées
quarter
and
on
the
first
day
the
parisians
generally
abstained
from
going
there
but
on
the
morrow
when
news
that
the
preliminaries
of
peace
had
been
accepted
at
bordeaux
had
reached
the
capital
they
flocked
to
gaze
upon
amis
les
and
greatly
enjoyed
i
believe
the
lively
music
played
by
the
german
regimental
bands
music
hath
charms
as
we
are
all
aware
the
departure
of
the
german
troops
on
the
ensuing
evening
was
of
a
much
more
spectacular
character
than
their
entry
had
been
as
with
their
bands
playing
whilst
they
themselves
sang
the
wacht
am
rhein
in
chorus
they
marched
up
the
champs
elysées
on
their
way
back
to
versailles
those
of
their
comrades
who
were
still
billeted
in
the
houses
came
to
the
balconies
with
as
many
lighted
candles
as
they
could
carry
bivouac
fires
moreover
were
burning
brightly
here
and
there
and
the
whole
animated
scene
with
its
play
of
light
and
shade
under
the
dark
march
sky
was
one
to
be
long
remembered
the
war
was
over
and
a
new
era
had
begun
for
europe
the
balance
of
power
was
largely
transferred
france
had
again
ceased
to
be
the
predominant
continental
state
she
had
attained
to
that
position
for
a
time
under
louis
xiv
and
later
more
conspicuously
under
napoleon
i
but
in
both
of
those
instances
vaulting
ambition
had
itself
the
purposes
of
napoleon
iii
were
less
such
ideas
of
aggrandisement
as
he
entertained
were
largely
subordinated
to
his
desire
to
consolidate
the
he
had
revived
and
to
ensure
the
continuity
of
his
dynasty
but
the
very
principle
of
nationality
which
he
more
than
once
expounded
and
which
he
championed
in
the
case
of
italy
brought
about
his
ruin
he
gave
italy
venetia
but
refused
her
rome
and
thereby
alienated
her
further
the
consolidation
of
germany
from
his
own
nationalist
point
of
view
became
a
threat
to
french
interests
thus
he
was
hoist
chiefly
by
his
own
and
france
paid
the
penalty
for
his
errors
the
war
was
over
i
have
said
but
there
came
a
terrible
aftermath
that
is
the
rising
of
the
commune
some
of
the
introductory
features
of
which
were
described
by
me
in
republican
france
there
is
only
one
fairly
good
history
of
that
formidable
insurrection
in
the
english
language
one
written
some
years
ago
by
thomas
march
it
is
however
a
history
from
the
official
standpoint
and
is
consequently
as
well
as
inaccurate
in
certain
respects
again
the
english
version
of
the
history
of
the
commune
put
together
by
one
of
its
partisans
lissagaray
sins
in
the
other
direction
an
impartial
account
of
the
rising
remains
to
be
written
if
i
am
spared
i
may
perhaps
be
privileged
to
contribute
to
it
by
preparing
a
work
on
much
the
same
lines
as
those
of
this
present
volume
not
only
do
i
possess
the
greater
part
of
the
literature
on
the
subject
including
many
of
the
newspapers
of
the
time
but
throughout
the
insurrection
i
was
in
paris
or
its
suburbs
i
sketched
the
dead
bodies
of
generals
clément
thomas
and
lecomte
only
a
few
hours
after
their
assassination
i
saw
the
vendôme
column
fall
while
american
visitors
to
paris
were
singing
hail
columbia
in
the
hotels
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
i
was
under
fire
in
the
same
street
when
a
demonstration
was
made
there
provided
with
passports
by
both
sides
i
went
in
and
out
of
the
city
and
witnessed
the
fighting
at
asnières
and
elsewhere
i
attended
the
clubs
held
in
the
churches
when
women
often
perorated
from
the
pulpits
i
saw
thiers
house
being
demolished
and
when
the
end
came
and
the
versailles
troops
made
their
entry
into
the
city
i
was
repeatedly
in
the
with
my
good
friend
captain
bingham
i
recollect
sketching
the
attack
on
the
elysée
palace
from
a
balcony
of
our
house
and
finding
that
balcony
on
the
pavement
a
few
hours
later
when
it
had
been
carried
away
by
a
shell
from
a
communard
battery
at
montmartre
finally
i
saw
paris
burning
i
gazed
on
the
sheaves
of
flames
rising
above
the
tuileries
i
saw
the
whole
front
of
the
ministry
of
finances
fall
into
the
rue
de
rivoli
i
saw
the
now
vanished
carrefour
de
la
croix
rouge
one
blaze
of
fire
i
helped
to
carry
water
to
put
out
the
conflagration
at
the
palais
de
justice
i
was
prodded
with
a
bayonet
when
after
working
in
that
manner
for
some
hours
i
attempted
to
shirk
duty
at
another
fire
which
i
came
upon
in
the
course
of
my
expeditions
all
that
period
of
my
life
flashes
on
my
mind
as
vividly
as
paris
herself
flashed
under
the
wondering
stars
of
those
balmy
nights
in
may
my
father
and
my
brother
arthur
also
had
some
remarkable
adventures
there
was
one
occasion
when
they
persuaded
a
venturesome
paris
cabman
to
drive
them
from
conflagration
to
conflagration
and
this
whilst
the
was
still
in
progress
every
now
and
then
as
they
drove
on
men
and
women
ran
eagerly
out
of
houses
into
which
wounded
combatants
had
been
taken
imagining
that
they
must
belong
to
the
medical
profession
as
nobody
else
was
likely
to
go
about
paris
in
such
a
fashion
at
such
a
moment
those
good
folk
forgot
the
journalists
the
service
of
the
press
carries
with
it
obligations
which
must
not
be
shirked
journalism
has
become
not
merely
the
chronicle
of
the
day
but
the
foundation
of
history
and
now
i
know
not
if
i
should
say
farewell
or
to
my
readers
whether
i
ever
attempt
a
detailed
account
of
the
commune
of
paris
must
depend
on
a
variety
of
circumstances
after
years
at
the
mill
i
am
inclined
to
feel
tired
and
with
me
health
is
not
what
it
has
been
nevertheless
my
plans
must
depend
chiefly
