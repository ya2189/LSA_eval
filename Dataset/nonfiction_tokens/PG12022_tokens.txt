start
in
i
have
entitled
this
little
book
a
start
in
life
because
it
conveys
information
which
would
enable
any
person
possessing
a
small
capital
with
some
industry
patience
and
steady
habits
to
make
a
start
in
life
which
humanly
speaking
could
not
fail
of
success
the
old
countries
of
europe
contain
a
superabundant
population
every
branch
of
professional
and
commercial
life
is
so
overcrowded
that
there
exists
a
competition
so
keen
as
to
reduce
the
incomes
of
the
largest
and
in
many
cases
to
prevent
the
smallest
workers
in
whatever
sphere
from
getting
a
remunerative
return
for
the
activities
of
brain
muscle
and
money
to
inform
the
public
therefore
how
a
young
man
may
make
a
first
start
in
life
or
an
older
man
a
fresh
start
in
life
is
offering
an
advantage
which
i
doubt
not
will
be
appreciated
by
many
who
read
these
pages
i
am
prepared
to
hear
the
objection
that
in
the
proposals
set
forth
herein
i
am
seeking
a
personal
advantage
as
agent
for
the
sale
of
the
lands
at
merced
in
california
that
i
refer
to
and
i
meet
it
with
this
statement
let
the
objector
consider
his
prospects
of
success
in
the
place
where
he
now
is
and
if
they
are
reasonably
good
let
him
stay
there
if
they
are
not
then
let
him
intelligently
consider
what
his
capabilities
are
whether
he
has
any
special
or
technical
knowledge
and
if
so
in
what
place
he
can
expect
the
best
return
for
a
full
use
of
his
talents
if
any
opening
appears
probable
in
any
of
the
old
countries
he
will
perhaps
first
consider
that
but
if
he
can
see
no
opening
at
home
then
let
him
consider
by
careful
investigation
the
more
distant
fields
let
him
learn
all
he
can
about
all
the
british
colonies
and
other
countries
and
especially
canada
and
the
united
states
as
being
nearest
to
great
britain
having
learnt
something
generally
of
these
distant
places
then
having
regard
to
his
own
abilities
and
capital
and
his
personal
desires
as
to
distance
from
the
old
country
climate
he
should
make
his
choice
as
to
which
of
the
places
he
has
read
of
seems
most
likely
to
give
him
a
fair
prospect
of
success
and
then
having
come
to
this
decision
he
should
learn
all
he
can
about
that
particular
place
i
admit
that
i
shall
receive
a
personal
benefit
by
persons
settling
at
merced
in
california
but
i
say
this
with
great
confidence
if
after
an
intelligent
consideration
of
other
places
any
person
desiring
a
start
in
life
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
fruit
culture
in
california
is
an
occupation
and
a
country
that
would
suit
him
then
let
him
consider
all
the
places
in
california
where
openings
for
this
occupation
are
presented
and
let
him
choose
which
of
them
he
considers
most
suitable
and
at
the
risk
of
appearing
invidious
i
would
add
that
he
should
not
believe
all
he
reads
but
should
make
his
examination
and
inquiries
for
himself
on
the
spot
i
do
not
ask
him
blindly
to
believe
what
is
set
forth
in
these
pages
but
if
he
thinks
that
california
is
a
suitable
place
of
settlement
for
him
then
i
do
say
with
great
emphasis
that
he
should
not
settle
upon
anything
in
california
until
he
has
been
to
merced
and
proved
for
himself
that
the
statements
are
credible
after
he
has
been
to
merced
i
have
little
doubt
that
he
will
be
convinced
that
that
place
presents
an
opening
which
would
be
worth
his
decision
if
he
proceed
to
california
by
the
southern
pacific
railway
he
could
break
his
journey
at
the
various
other
places
of
fruit
culture
settlement
and
inspect
them
reaching
merced
last
as
the
nearest
to
the
great
centre
of
san
francisco
a
careful
comparison
of
the
various
fields
of
fruit
culture
enterprise
will
i
am
assured
show
him
that
merced
possesses
peculiar
advantages
it
is
well
known
that
the
great
drawback
of
california
is
want
of
water
and
intending
settlers
must
not
be
satisfied
by
the
statements
of
agents
or
owners
that
their
lands
have
water
advantages
but
they
must
satisfy
themselves
that
they
can
have
water
by
irrigation
not
by
the
expensive
laborious
process
of
pumping
it
up
from
uncertain
springs
and
in
such
a
quantity
as
to
be
permanent
at
some
places
lands
now
supplied
by
irrigation
will
fall
short
presently
when
the
owners
carry
the
water
on
to
thousands
of
adjoining
acres
therefore
a
full
and
permanent
supply
of
water
is
an
essential
the
special
advantages
my
clients
offer
settlers
at
merced
are
a
permanent
supply
of
water
for
a
perpetual
water
right
accompanies
every
lot
of
land
sold
contiguity
to
a
railway
station
on
the
main
line
and
to
a
town
with
commercial
professional
educational
social
and
religious
advantages
instruction
in
fruit
culture
gratis
by
a
specialist
who
is
paid
by
my
clients
to
instruct
settlers
on
their
lands
a
rich
soil
of
which
on
another
page
an
analysis
is
given
a
ready
market
for
produce
buyers
come
round
the
country
and
purchase
the
crops
as
they
are
on
the
trees
taking
upon
themselves
the
picking
and
packing
the
continent
of
north
america
is
a
sufficient
market
in
itself
for
all
time
especially
considering
that
its
population
increases
nearly
a
million
and
a
half
a
year
the
prices
range
from
dollars
to
dollars
per
acre
at
some
other
places
in
california
land
is
offered
at
a
less
price
but
i
can
sell
some
land
at
even
dollars
per
acre
yet
that
at
dollars
per
acre
is
far
cheaper
having
regard
to
its
advantages
our
land
at
dollars
per
acre
will
favourably
compare
with
lands
fetching
much
higher
prices
free
conveyances
will
be
given
with
a
perfectly
clear
and
satisfactory
title
of
the
may
remain
on
mortgage
merced
is
only
days
from
london
a
liberal
competence
may
be
secured
by
a
reasonably
industrious
settler
merced
is
a
very
healthy
locality
and
is
nearer
to
san
francisco
than
other
fruit
growing
centres
my
clients
the
owners
are
gentlemen
of
wealth
and
position
in
california
and
not
irresponsible
land
speculators
members
of
a
syndicate
with
an
unknown
personality
comparison
and
warning
i
have
already
said
that
applicants
should
verify
for
themselves
the
statements
made
by
persons
who
like
myself
would
be
personally
benefited
by
their
settling
upon
the
lands
offered
for
sale
letters
sent
to
this
country
and
advertised
by
agents
as
a
guarantee
of
advantages
written
by
persons
soon
after
arrival
in
california
and
who
have
not
compared
the
place
of
their
location
with
other
places
can
scarcely
be
a
sufficient
recommendation
some
parts
of
california
advertised
in
this
country
for
sale
have
not
a
permanent
water
supply
are
too
hot
are
swept
by
winds
are
at
a
considerable
distance
from
a
railway
station
have
a
poor
sandy
soil
some
even
mixed
with
alkali
and
some
are
so
situated
as
to
be
notoriously
unhealthy
and
produce
chills
fevers
and
general
malaria
and
in
one
case
i
have
heard
of
an
embarrassed
title
therefore
i
say
that
intending
settlers
should
remember
there
is
a
california
and
a
california
that
it
is
not
all
gold
which
glitters
and
that
they
should
personally
and
intelligently
investigate
for
themselves
on
the
spot
the
statements
made
by
those
who
at
a
distance
offer
the
lands
for
sale
capital
required
it
is
recommended
that
settlers
intending
to
establish
fruit
farms
should
have
a
capital
of
from
upwards
but
those
who
have
a
smaller
capital
say
or
even
may
in
other
ways
find
some
opening
for
employing
it
if
accompanied
with
intelligent
industrious
persevering
work
start
in
to
ensure
the
stability
of
a
building
the
foundation
ought
to
be
substantial
so
in
like
manner
a
good
start
in
life
goes
a
great
way
towards
ensuring
a
successful
career
by
success
i
do
not
mean
the
making
of
a
rapid
fortune
by
leaps
and
bounds
of
prosperity
but
i
do
mean
an
ultimate
prosperity
acquired
through
patient
persevering
and
intelligent
labour
to
make
a
large
fortune
quickly
it
is
necessary
to
have
command
of
the
requisite
knowledge
of
the
business
in
hand
the
requisite
capital
untiring
energy
and
a
trait
of
genius
beyond
these
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
the
mind
absorbed
in
the
one
thing
and
therefore
supposing
one
possessed
the
requisites
would
it
be
worth
while
to
sacrifice
all
else
to
the
mere
accumulation
of
money
to
live
for
mere
money
making
is
a
grovelling
existence
and
utterly
unworthy
the
aim
of
any
man
possessing
the
finer
instincts
of
human
nature
and
the
intelligence
with
which
it
is
endowed
no
i
am
not
pretending
to
offer
the
means
of
making
a
rapid
fortune
such
accidents
fall
to
the
lot
of
but
few
out
of
the
millions
of
our
species
but
i
do
claim
to
be
able
to
offer
to
men
willing
to
live
a
steady
industrious
life
the
opportunity
of
acquiring
on
easy
terms
a
small
freehold
estate
into
which
they
can
put
the
golden
seed
of
their
own
mental
and
physical
effort
with
the
certainty
of
reaping
a
golden
harvest
proportionate
to
their
area
their
ability
and
their
industry
for
when
once
a
fruit
farm
is
planted
it
increases
in
value
every
year
to
own
a
freehold
estate
of
or
acres
with
a
comfortable
house
and
buildings
and
the
land
well
stocked
with
choice
fruits
with
a
ready
market
presents
a
prospect
by
the
use
of
a
small
capital
with
the
addition
of
muscle
and
brains
of
future
competence
when
such
a
property
is
fully
matured
labour
can
be
hired
and
one
own
personal
energies
may
be
diverted
if
preferred
into
other
channels
or
continued
in
the
same
with
largely
accumulating
benefits
i
ask
my
readers
requiring
for
themselves
or
others
in
whom
they
are
interested
a
start
in
life
to
read
these
pages
carefully
for
i
do
not
know
any
calling
in
the
old
or
new
world
where
a
small
capitalist
fond
of
country
life
could
find
an
occupation
more
congenial
than
the
one
i
offer
at
merced
in
california
and
which
is
described
herein
residence
near
to
a
young
town
which
will
probably
increase
rapidly
in
value
and
which
now
possesses
extensive
commercial
locomotive
social
and
religious
advantages
a
climate
than
which
the
surface
of
this
globe
scarcely
presents
one
more
desirable
a
fortnight
journey
from
london
and
a
soil
pregnant
with
inherent
virtue
are
amongst
the
considerations
of
importance
which
will
determine
thoughtful
investors
to
settle
at
merced
i
am
prepared
to
show
to
applicants
samples
of
the
soils
and
fruits
and
also
views
books
maps
and
to
answer
questions
if
they
will
call
personally
upon
me
at
my
offices
lincoln
inn
fields
london
so
that
they
may
have
every
assistance
in
enabling
them
to
come
to
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
start
in
life
i
offer
them
at
merced
in
california
is
one
suitable
in
respect
of
their
inclination
capital
abilities
and
energy
within
a
fortnight
of
london
to
prove
the
convenient
access
of
this
land
called
british
colony
from
london
i
may
say
that
on
november
i
left
liverpool
in
the
cunard
steamer
etruria
which
reached
new
york
on
the
following
saturday
evening
just
too
late
for
the
officers
to
examine
the
luggage
so
that
we
could
not
go
on
shore
till
the
next
morning
i
stayed
over
the
sunday
hours
in
new
york
leaving
on
monday
by
the
first
overland
train
and
after
calling
at
innumerable
stations
and
staying
hours
at
chicago
and
council
bluffs
to
make
connections
catch
other
trains
and
staying
hours
at
san
francisco
i
arrived
at
merced
at
on
monday
night
december
say
days
hours
after
leaving
liverpool
had
i
have
left
liverpool
by
the
wednesday
instead
of
the
saturday
steamer
i
should
not
have
needed
to
have
stayed
over
sunday
in
new
york
and
of
course
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
a
settler
to
stay
at
san
francisco
i
had
to
meet
my
clients
there
therefore
deducting
these
two
stoppages
of
hours
or
days
it
would
give
days
to
merced
in
the
season
in
fine
weather
the
journey
could
be
made
in
less
time
some
steamers
in
the
summer
and
autumn
months
have
crossed
from
liverpool
to
new
york
in
about
six
days
so
that
the
journey
be
made
in
favourable
circumstances
in
say
to
days
but
we
may
safely
put
it
at
days
i
went
by
the
northern
prairies
and
rocky
mountains
and
returned
by
the
longer
route
of
southern
california
the
desert
of
arizona
the
plains
of
texas
through
the
sugar
and
cotton
districts
of
the
southern
states
and
thence
viâ
new
orleans
and
washington
back
to
new
york
thus
after
remaining
eight
days
at
merced
where
i
was
fully
engaged
each
day
in
inspecting
the
lands
for
sale
and
the
country
around
for
many
miles
and
after
allowing
for
stoppages
on
the
return
journey
over
sundays
and
waiting
three
days
at
new
york
for
the
cunard
steamer
servia
i
reached
liverpool
on
january
and
was
back
again
in
my
office
on
monday
january
being
six
weeks
one
day
and
hours
from
the
time
i
rose
from
my
chair
in
my
office
to
the
time
i
was
sitting
in
it
again
london
to
chicago
travelling
in
generations
past
was
an
important
event
in
one
life
but
now
a
journey
across
an
ocean
and
a
continent
is
a
very
commonplace
affair
books
of
travel
used
to
be
read
with
avidity
but
now
that
so
many
persons
travel
and
the
wires
keep
us
in
touch
with
all
the
world
every
day
the
history
of
a
journey
is
a
small
event
and
one
which
to
those
not
specially
interested
would
scarcely
perhaps
be
read
nevertheless
as
some
of
my
readers
may
have
to
go
over
some
of
the
ground
i
have
recently
traversed
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
reference
to
my
journey
to
california
and
back
would
be
of
interest
to
them
and
therefore
i
will
give
up
some
time
and
space
to
the
subject
this
little
record
of
my
journey
may
perhaps
be
better
received
if
i
state
that
i
am
not
a
novice
in
travel
and
that
before
i
had
turned
years
of
age
i
had
been
to
australia
calling
at
pernambuco
in
south
america
and
that
while
in
australia
i
visited
melbourne
sydney
geelong
king
george
sound
besides
various
inland
towns
and
gold
fields
including
bendigo
castlemaine
tarrangower
fryer
creek
forest
creek
campbell
creek
tarradale
maryborough
and
various
other
places
and
sheep
and
cattle
stations
from
australia
i
went
to
aden
the
inland
town
and
up
the
red
sea
to
suez
returning
to
australia
and
thence
to
england
since
i
commenced
business
in
england
in
i
went
in
to
thomas
in
the
west
indies
thence
to
aspinwall
across
the
isthmus
to
panama
thence
to
acapulco
in
mexico
on
to
san
francisco
in
california
and
thence
to
vancouver
island
returning
by
the
same
route
as
far
as
aspinwall
whence
i
went
to
new
york
in
i
went
on
business
to
russia
arriving
at
the
ancient
city
of
pskov
i
proceeded
across
country
to
the
estate
of
my
client
the
count
bogouschefsky
at
one
time
private
secretary
to
the
emperor
nicholas
grandfather
of
the
present
czar
some
of
these
travels
were
attended
with
a
good
deal
of
adventure
but
my
recent
journey
from
england
to
california
and
back
miles
in
six
weeks
including
all
stoppages
was
all
work
for
my
time
was
occupied
continuously
in
reading
up
the
country
learning
from
old
settlers
and
making
notes
of
what
i
saw
some
of
which
i
have
found
room
for
in
the
following
pages
on
november
i
was
at
work
in
my
office
in
lincoln
inn
fields
whence
a
cab
depositing
me
at
euston
the
express
train
soon
ran
me
down
to
liverpool
miles
whence
a
steam
tender
took
me
from
the
to
the
cunard
steamship
etruria
some
two
miles
off
where
i
was
soon
comfortably
located
in
my
state
room
no
it
was
nearly
before
we
got
away
and
the
next
day
found
us
at
queenstown
harbour
where
we
lost
considerable
time
in
waiting
for
the
mail
at
length
the
mail
which
was
a
heavy
one
was
safely
on
board
and
off
we
went
head
on
to
the
atlantic
during
that
night
of
the
we
experienced
a
heavy
gale
big
seas
broke
over
the
forecastle
and
flooded
the
decks
below
through
the
ventilators
the
declined
venturing
on
the
forecastle
to
unship
these
great
ventilators
and
so
the
engines
had
to
be
slowed
down
and
the
ship
stopped
the
ventilators
were
then
unshipped
and
we
proceeded
the
night
was
a
bad
one
and
the
next
morning
we
had
not
got
through
it
and
as
a
consequence
the
decks
were
like
lagoons
but
presently
we
had
run
through
it
or
it
had
run
away
from
us
or
had
expended
its
energy
and
we
were
in
comparatively
smooth
waters
and
had
a
comfortable
run
to
new
york
nothing
of
particular
interest
occurred
during
the
passage
i
sought
and
found
the
old
american
settlers
amongst
the
passengers
and
obtained
from
them
all
the
information
i
could
of
the
country
and
especially
the
state
to
which
i
was
going
i
read
general
booth
darkest
england
and
wrote
a
review
of
it
which
duly
appeared
in
the
land
roll
the
etruria
is
a
fine
ship
she
has
a
commodious
saloon
music
and
reading
room
plenty
of
deck
space
for
exercise
comfortable
cabins
bath
rooms
etc
on
the
we
made
sandy
hook
lighthouse
which
is
about
miles
from
new
york
dock
but
we
got
in
too
late
for
the
officers
to
look
at
our
baggage
so
we
lay
all
night
in
the
harbour
and
next
morning
commenced
the
tedious
process
of
creeping
up
yard
by
yard
into
our
berth
at
the
dock
the
run
from
liverpool
was
thus
liverpool
to
queenstown
on
the
and
miles
at
noon
miles
distance
to
sandy
hook
lighthouse
miles
so
that
the
run
totals
up
to
and
with
the
miles
added
miles
i
had
been
recommended
by
a
passenger
to
go
to
the
hotel
stephen
to
east
eleventh
street
new
york
whence
i
drove
in
a
cab
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
for
which
the
cabman
wanted
dollars
equal
to
he
got
which
was
too
much
passengers
should
drive
to
their
hotel
and
then
ask
the
proper
fare
before
paying
new
york
has
many
large
hotels
this
is
comparatively
a
small
one
all
the
waiters
are
coloured
men
and
this
seems
pretty
general
throughout
america
i
stayed
over
the
sunday
in
new
york
by
which
i
secured
a
quiet
day
and
an
opportunity
to
attend
divine
service
in
my
bedroom
was
a
coil
of
stout
manilla
rope
screwed
into
the
floor
near
a
window
so
that
an
escape
might
be
secured
in
the
event
of
fire
the
towels
provided
are
a
kind
of
compromise
between
a
duster
and
a
pocket
handkerchief
rather
disappointing
to
one
accustomed
to
his
tub
new
york
is
great
in
worked
by
horses
mules
and
electricity
also
elevated
railways
that
is
railways
running
down
the
streets
on
huge
tressels
or
scaffolding
so
that
the
vehicles
go
underneath
them
and
the
passengers
in
the
train
look
straight
into
the
windows
of
the
houses
on
the
other
side
there
is
an
immense
development
of
electricity
all
over
america
and
in
hotels
houses
everything
and
everywhere
is
the
electric
light
prominent
many
of
the
streets
are
unevenly
paved
blacking
boots
is
a
profession
in
america
in
many
hotels
a
special
charge
is
made
for
it
or
else
the
visitors
are
left
to
their
own
devices
thereon
and
have
shops
and
nooks
fitted
with
high
huge
easy
chairs
elevated
like
thrones
where
their
clients
can
comfortably
repose
during
the
operation
of
polish
the
next
morning
december
i
was
up
early
and
made
enquiries
at
the
various
offices
representing
the
railway
lines
to
chicago
with
the
result
that
i
took
a
ticket
by
the
pennsylvania
route
and
left
new
york
at
the
train
service
between
new
york
and
chicago
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
best
in
america
the
cars
are
elegantly
fitted
they
are
about
the
length
of
the
pullman
cars
we
have
in
england
the
best
cars
are
those
fitted
with
sleeping
accommodation
and
travellers
having
tickets
for
a
sleeper
have
the
privilege
of
using
the
sleeping
car
during
the
day
the
sleeping
cars
are
divided
into
squares
capable
of
seating
four
persons
but
the
space
is
accorded
to
two
only
as
only
two
beds
or
berths
can
be
made
up
in
the
space
the
lower
berth
which
is
always
the
favourite
is
formed
of
the
two
double
seats
the
space
for
four
seats
filled
up
in
the
centre
by
special
fittings
and
mattresses
hidden
during
the
day
inside
the
seats
the
upper
berth
is
pulled
down
from
the
sloping
roof
of
the
car
and
in
the
receptacle
between
the
slope
and
the
square
are
contained
the
bedding
and
the
fittings
a
curtain
falls
down
over
both
the
upper
and
lower
berths
and
so
far
as
one
can
the
dressing
has
to
be
done
with
the
curtain
hanging
round
one
as
one
stands
within
it
and
if
on
both
sides
of
the
car
passengers
happen
to
stand
behind
their
respective
curtains
at
the
same
time
they
would
touch
one
another
and
so
block
the
the
dressing
accommodation
is
so
inconvenient
that
only
partial
undressing
is
adopted
the
outside
of
the
slope
is
polished
mahogany
and
in
the
daytime
bears
no
indication
whatever
of
what
it
really
is
but
looks
like
a
handsome
sloping
polished
mahogany
roof
these
cars
are
luxuriously
fitted
another
car
on
the
train
is
a
handsome
dining
saloon
with
kitchen
attached
where
you
can
order
as
good
a
dinner
as
you
could
obtain
at
an
hotel
the
cars
are
also
fitted
liberally
with
lavatories
and
separate
ones
for
ladies
and
for
gentlemen
on
this
train
is
also
a
and
a
shop
there
are
also
one
or
two
small
private
rooms
which
can
be
hired
separately
this
train
has
also
a
recent
addition
being
what
is
called
a
or
observation
car
this
is
the
last
on
the
train
and
the
end
is
fitted
with
glass
so
that
in
riding
along
passengers
in
this
car
enjoy
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
country
they
are
leaving
behind
on
this
special
train
a
ladies
maid
is
provided
for
the
convenience
of
ladies
and
a
stenographer
with
his
machine
occupies
a
seat
in
the
vestibule
of
the
car
to
take
down
any
urgent
letters
which
business
men
may
desire
to
post
the
observation
car
is
supplied
with
a
library
for
the
use
of
passengers
and
is
fitted
with
windows
and
easy
chairs
it
has
a
platform
where
one
can
breathe
the
fresh
air
outside
if
desired
there
is
also
a
car
on
this
special
train
the
stock
exchange
reports
of
the
new
york
and
philadelphia
exchanges
are
received
and
posted
on
the
bulletin
boards
three
times
a
day
and
the
weather
reports
are
also
posted
the
whole
of
the
train
is
thoroughly
well
heated
by
steam
pipes
and
lighted
by
electricity
the
person
in
charge
of
a
sleeper
car
is
called
the
porter
he
occupies
a
position
not
like
a
porter
on
an
english
railway
but
analagous
to
a
steward
on
board
ship
on
leaving
new
york
i
noticed
that
the
suburbs
contained
many
very
small
wooden
houses
and
the
country
had
the
appearance
of
many
colonial
scenes
i
have
witnessed
the
land
looked
like
reclaimed
prairie
which
it
probably
is
and
after
passing
many
homesteads
and
villages
we
ran
into
philadelphia
at
philadelphia
is
the
largest
city
as
to
area
in
the
united
states
it
is
situate
on
the
west
bank
of
the
delaware
river
it
is
miles
long
and
from
to
broad
comprising
an
area
of
square
miles
it
has
over
miles
of
paved
streets
philadelphia
was
founded
by
the
celebrated
william
penn
who
went
from
england
to
america
in
and
purchased
the
site
of
this
great
city
from
the
indians
william
penn
character
was
remarkable
for
his
high
sense
of
honour
and
if
the
same
principle
had
obtained
throughout
the
history
of
the
united
states
with
the
indians
we
should
never
have
heard
of
any
indian
difficulty
penn
presented
the
city
with
a
charter
in
the
city
built
upon
lands
honestly
and
liberally
bought
from
the
indians
prospered
greatly
and
its
population
continued
to
increase
until
it
now
reaches
something
approaching
its
chief
source
of
wealth
is
from
its
manufactures
which
embrace
locomotives
and
all
kinds
of
ironware
ships
carpets
woollen
and
cotton
goods
shoes
umbrellas
and
books
it
has
more
buildings
than
any
other
city
in
that
country
and
in
point
of
commerce
ranks
fourth
among
the
cities
of
the
united
states
i
noticed
that
the
suburbs
of
philadelphia
contained
many
handsome
stone
and
brick
residences
i
felt
much
interested
in
the
connection
with
william
penn
because
he
is
one
of
the
ancestors
of
the
of
england
who
for
many
years
have
been
valuable
and
clients
of
mine
and
in
numerous
transactions
i
have
noticed
in
them
that
beautiful
trait
of
strict
honour
which
gave
william
penn
a
character
and
has
descended
from
him
to
them
passing
by
many
farm
homesteads
villages
and
towns
all
having
a
prosperous
kind
of
appearance
and
described
as
one
of
the
richest
agricultural
districts
in
america
we
ran
into
harrisburg
which
is
the
capital
of
pennsylvania
and
situate
on
the
east
bank
of
the
susquehanna
river
about
five
miles
above
harrisburg
we
crossed
the
susquehanna
river
on
a
bridge
feet
long
from
the
centre
of
which
i
am
told
there
is
a
fine
view
but
i
lost
it
as
a
snowstorm
was
raging
while
i
was
crossing
we
stopped
at
altoona
a
large
city
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
alleghanies
and
in
ascending
the
alleghanies
fine
scenery
and
great
engineering
feats
are
discernible
from
this
we
ran
on
to
pittsburg
which
claims
to
be
the
best
lighted
city
in
america
the
streets
being
brilliantly
illuminated
by
arc
and
incandescent
electric
lights
nine
bridges
cross
the
allegheny
and
five
the
monongahela
rivers
pittsburg
has
been
called
the
iron
city
and
smoky
city
it
has
immense
glass
steel
and
iron
manufactures
and
in
these
three
interests
alone
employs
over
persons
then
we
proceed
till
presently
we
catch
sight
of
lake
michigan
and
know
that
chicago
is
not
far
off
we
skirt
the
shore
of
this
busy
water
with
its
wharves
etc
on
arrival
december
we
drive
through
the
city
from
the
pennsylvania
to
the
terminus
chicago
is
miles
from
new
york
it
is
the
greatest
city
in
illinois
and
during
the
past
years
has
grown
from
a
small
indian
trading
station
into
a
metropolis
chicago
extends
some
miles
along
the
shores
of
lake
michigan
and
goes
back
from
the
lake
to
a
depth
of
about
four
miles
thus
embracing
about
square
miles
beyond
these
confines
of
the
city
proper
the
suburbs
extend
to
some
to
miles
in
every
direction
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
chicago
had
a
great
fire
which
burned
an
area
of
square
miles
destroyed
buildings
made
persons
homeless
and
killed
outright
about
more
the
loss
of
property
was
estimated
at
dollars
of
which
only
dollars
were
recovered
from
insurances
and
this
bankrupted
some
of
the
insurance
companies
in
another
fire
consumed
dollars
worth
of
property
chicago
is
the
great
central
depôt
for
grain
lumber
and
live
stock
in
there
were
packed
at
chicago
hogs
and
about
cattle
chicago
has
also
extensive
iron
steel
wheel
car
flour
furniture
boot
and
shoe
and
tannery
manufactures
in
driving
through
i
noticed
one
long
street
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
street
i
was
traversing
thickly
occupied
with
tradesmen
carts
backed
on
the
kerb
in
the
usual
fashion
being
loaded
from
the
stores
or
shops
there
must
have
been
a
few
hundred
of
them
i
never
saw
so
many
in
one
street
at
one
time
anywhere
in
any
part
of
the
world
chicago
was
cased
in
frozen
snow
and
thus
was
not
very
attractive
but
i
noticed
many
very
fine
buildings
and
was
much
struck
with
the
cosmopolitan
character
of
the
inhabitants
during
the
interval
of
waiting
for
the
train
on
the
to
start
i
was
able
to
see
a
little
of
the
place
and
found
that
some
persons
i
spoke
to
could
not
speak
english
they
came
apparently
from
all
parts
of
the
continent
of
europe
chicago
to
san
francisco
the
train
was
due
at
chicago
december
at
being
exactly
a
hours
and
minutes
run
from
new
york
having
crossed
chicago
from
one
terminus
to
another
i
found
that
three
trains
left
chicago
by
which
i
could
travel
to
san
francisco
two
were
slow
trains
and
one
a
fast
train
but
by
whichever
train
i
went
it
would
make
no
difference
as
to
the
time
i
left
omaha
and
consequently
no
difference
to
the
time
i
should
arrive
at
san
francisco
so
i
went
on
by
one
of
the
slow
trains
as
i
wanted
to
see
council
bluffs
this
train
was
similarly
fitted
to
the
other
except
that
it
had
no
car
nor
stenographer
nor
were
the
platforms
connecting
the
carriages
enclosed
so
that
in
passing
to
the
dining
car
or
any
other
car
the
sudden
change
from
a
hot
car
to
a
shower
of
snow
was
not
pleasant
the
distance
from
chicago
to
omaha
is
miles
and
the
country
between
the
two
places
formed
a
part
of
the
great
prairie
region
which
years
ago
had
no
other
inhabitant
than
the
indian
and
the
trapper
but
now
is
a
succession
of
homesteads
villages
and
towns
bearing
evidence
of
prosperity
at
creston
and
many
other
stations
i
noticed
that
there
is
no
protection
whatever
from
the
railway
the
line
is
unfenced
and
the
train
runs
through
the
town
as
openly
as
a
coach
would
there
is
generally
a
rough
board
put
up
here
and
there
with
the
words
crudely
painted
on
them
look
out
for
the
cars
we
were
due
at
council
bluffs
the
next
morning
december
at
but
we
arrived
some
late
council
bluffs
station
is
four
miles
from
omaha
station
but
the
towns
adjoin
the
former
has
a
population
of
over
and
the
latter
of
over
they
are
divided
by
the
great
missouri
river
which
is
crossed
by
two
bridges
one
being
feet
long
and
the
other
feet
long
having
had
breakfast
at
the
station
i
went
up
to
the
town
by
the
motor
that
is
the
electrical
the
motor
cars
like
the
railway
cars
are
heated
i
noticed
a
large
number
of
detached
wooden
cottages
standing
in
their
own
grounds
of
about
of
an
acre
and
i
learned
that
these
are
owned
by
labourers
day
an
agent
there
told
me
that
the
cottage
would
cost
dollars
and
the
land
dollars
for
the
house
and
for
the
land
an
eighth
of
an
acre
for
would
be
per
acre
and
this
quite
out
in
the
suburbs
and
i
was
told
that
good
business
blocks
in
the
town
itself
would
fetch
not
dollars
but
pounds
per
acre
in
the
large
cities
such
as
new
york
chicago
prices
in
the
principal
streets
would
compare
with
prices
in
the
city
of
london
returning
to
the
station
i
joined
the
express
train
and
crossing
the
missouri
river
to
omaha
we
proceeded
west
the
river
was
frozen
at
its
sides
and
presented
no
attractions
worth
notice
on
we
go
through
hundreds
of
fields
of
maize
always
called
corn
in
america
other
grain
crops
such
as
wheat
are
called
by
their
own
names
but
the
crop
known
only
as
corn
in
america
is
maize
the
rich
clusters
of
corn
are
gathered
and
the
stalks
something
in
appearance
between
a
wheat
stalk
and
a
sugar
cane
are
left
standing
for
the
cattle
to
pick
over
forty
years
ago
part
was
uninhabited
by
white
men
and
was
the
home
of
countless
buffaloes
now
these
animals
are
extirpated
and
everywhere
we
see
nothing
for
mile
upon
mile
but
corn
corn
corn
one
of
my
fellow
travellers
was
jacobs
of
chicago
whose
was
one
of
the
pioneers
and
who
gave
me
much
information
the
next
day
december
we
traverse
the
great
rolling
prairies
of
nebraska
and
see
many
herds
of
horses
and
cattle
and
here
and
there
ranch
homes
and
cowboys
having
run
through
illinois
iowa
and
nebraska
we
commence
the
state
of
wyoming
as
we
pull
up
at
the
city
of
cheyenne
where
in
the
far
distance
we
see
with
its
peaks
well
clothed
in
snow
the
grand
range
of
the
rocky
mountains
soon
after
leaving
cheyenne
we
commence
the
ascent
of
the
rockies
not
of
course
the
actual
summit
range
itself
but
the
foot
hills
and
high
lands
stretching
away
from
and
forming
part
of
it
and
as
we
climb
the
ascent
terminating
at
sherman
where
we
have
gained
an
elevation
of
feet
we
pass
through
very
wild
grand
scenery
at
this
altitude
we
look
down
upon
floating
clouds
and
see
in
the
distance
long
peak
feet
high
towering
above
them
all
along
at
intervals
are
portable
fences
placed
to
catch
the
snow
as
it
drifts
to
prevent
it
blocking
the
line
and
also
what
are
called
snow
sheds
which
are
rough
timber
tunnels
built
up
to
protect
the
rails
from
the
great
drifts
arising
out
of
heavy
snowstorms
at
the
highest
point
is
a
pyramid
commemorating
a
certain
oakes
ames
which
looked
feet
high
and
very
near
the
line
it
is
however
feet
high
and
off
the
air
is
so
rarefied
that
distances
are
most
deceiving
as
our
descent
proceeds
we
catch
sight
in
the
distance
of
a
herd
of
wild
elk
and
where
these
rolling
prairies
have
better
herbage
we
see
herds
of
horses
with
ranch
buildings
here
and
there
we
pass
the
ranch
of
william
cody
who
by
virtue
of
his
being
a
senator
of
the
state
of
nebraska
is
called
honourable
but
who
was
known
in
london
a
short
time
ago
at
whitley
wild
west
show
as
buffalo
bill
as
we
pass
fort
laraime
one
of
the
forts
erected
by
the
united
states
government
as
a
protection
against
the
indians
i
was
told
some
stories
of
cody
exploits
against
the
indians
in
former
days
emigrants
traversing
these
great
prairies
to
found
a
home
in
this
wild
west
were
often
harassed
by
indians
and
the
soldiers
at
the
fort
had
to
protect
them
buffalo
bill
has
been
in
many
a
skirmish
and
if
rumour
is
true
many
redskins
have
succumbed
to
him
the
government
took
counsel
with
him
in
all
indian
difficulties
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
the
day
before
i
passed
his
ranch
he
had
been
sent
for
by
the
authorities
that
they
might
confer
with
him
as
to
the
outbreak
which
then
existed
and
which
cost
sitting
bull
his
life
we
passed
a
house
cut
clean
in
two
by
the
wind
great
herds
of
horses
and
cattle
beautiful
specimens
of
the
bald
and
other
eagles
and
vultures
some
deer
and
a
very
fine
grey
wolf
about
the
size
of
a
newfoundland
dog
the
distant
mountain
scenery
at
times
is
very
grand
and
everywhere
the
air
is
very
pure
and
keen
i
much
enjoyed
the
society
of
two
fellow
travellers
over
this
part
of
my
journey
lee
of
general
lee
family
of
virginia
and
hurley
solicitor
to
the
directors
of
the
line
we
were
traversing
we
passed
the
divide
of
the
continent
at
an
altitude
of
feet
which
is
the
dividing
line
of
the
running
of
water
that
running
east
empties
into
the
north
platte
river
thence
into
the
missouri
thence
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
atlantic
ocean
that
running
west
empties
into
the
green
river
thence
into
the
colorado
thence
into
the
pacific
ocean
in
the
early
morning
of
december
we
ran
into
ogden
which
is
near
salt
lake
at
the
base
of
the
wasatch
mountains
which
are
and
have
some
very
fine
peaks
salt
lake
is
by
miles
and
on
it
is
situate
the
great
city
of
the
mormons
on
the
more
fertile
parts
of
the
prairies
i
gathered
at
humboldt
wells
some
of
the
sage
grass
which
used
to
be
the
food
of
the
buffaloes
when
they
existed
at
other
places
i
gathered
samples
of
herbage
on
less
favoured
soils
as
we
proceed
we
see
an
encampment
of
indians
with
red
paint
on
their
faces
which
was
put
on
to
show
sympathy
with
and
if
necessary
take
part
with
other
tribes
of
indians
then
commencing
a
war
with
the
united
states
soldiers
this
district
was
not
far
as
distances
go
in
america
from
the
scene
of
action
presently
we
commence
our
run
through
the
great
barren
alkali
plains
emerging
from
which
we
get
into
a
more
fertile
country
and
at
cedar
pass
notice
the
great
ranch
of
sparks
and
tinnin
who
are
reputed
to
have
head
of
cattle
byrne
of
elko
nevada
also
the
owner
of
a
large
ranch
was
on
board
the
cars
and
gave
me
some
useful
information
he
said
that
cattle
raising
is
very
profitable
as
they
double
in
number
every
four
years
a
profit
of
per
cent
thus
if
a
man
start
with
a
head
of
stock
cattle
he
will
have
head
in
four
years
if
a
thousand
head
of
stock
cattle
were
purchased
off
a
ranch
they
would
be
sold
just
as
they
run
without
any
selection
whatever
steers
heifers
cows
calves
bulls
yearlings
both
sexes
and
all
ages
but
calves
which
still
suck
their
mothers
are
not
counted
and
go
for
nothing
many
head
of
cattle
perish
in
the
winter
when
the
land
is
covered
with
snow
as
on
many
large
ranches
no
food
is
given
them
i
urged
that
it
would
pay
to
have
and
give
food
during
the
snow
time
and
byrne
said
that
he
always
did
so
himself
and
that
the
great
ranch
men
were
having
their
eyes
opened
to
this
necessity
we
passed
various
other
encampments
of
indians
and
far
from
any
encampment
or
habitation
saw
an
indian
on
the
track
carrying
a
small
light
bundle
and
following
him
a
long
way
behind
was
his
squaw
labouring
under
a
very
heavy
burden
during
this
day
we
ran
through
ranges
of
uneven
mountains
rising
one
above
another
in
broken
undulations
and
with
tops
such
as
table
lands
sharp
conical
peaks
rounded
heads
and
broken
indentations
the
distant
mountains
are
enveloped
in
snow
upon
which
gleams
a
resplendent
setting
sun
presenting
a
prospect
which
only
such
a
region
could
produce
from
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
one
range
we
look
upon
the
dense
darkness
of
another
as
being
out
of
the
sun
influence
the
lights
and
shades
the
gorges
the
fissures
the
striations
in
the
range
upon
range
with
their
intervals
of
plains
and
valleys
here
and
there
opening
up
peeps
of
great
tracts
of
country
and
then
again
shutting
all
in
to
the
circumference
of
their
gigantic
heads
interspersed
with
the
brilliance
of
rich
gold
tingeing
some
tops
and
revealing
dark
recesses
some
ruby
tints
and
fantastic
shadows
all
combine
to
reflect
a
glory
which
lifts
the
mind
beyond
the
great
heights
of
hills
to
a
height
greater
still
whence
originated
all
natural
grandeur
we
had
run
through
utah
and
nevada
and
were
now
approaching
the
northern
part
of
california
in
the
very
early
morning
of
december
i
awoke
and
found
that
the
train
was
at
a
standstill
thinking
that
we
were
at
a
station
i
tried
to
sleep
again
but
finding
that
we
continued
motionless
i
went
out
on
to
the
platform
connecting
our
car
with
the
next
and
found
all
around
was
deep
snow
and
that
another
train
on
the
other
metals
had
broken
down
and
that
our
men
were
apparently
helping
to
get
it
off
we
were
then
two
miles
from
truckee
and
at
an
elevation
of
nearly
feet
after
a
long
delay
we
got
away
and
ran
into
truckee
the
scenery
on
this
day
was
also
of
a
truly
grand
character
precipices
declivities
chasms
and
in
one
very
romantic
spot
of
weird
and
wild
mountain
sides
graduating
to
narrow
gullies
with
pine
and
other
trees
some
perfect
others
broken
by
the
wind
was
one
great
wreck
of
a
forest
monster
a
tree
rudely
snapped
asunder
by
wind
or
lightning
about
feet
from
the
ground
and
stripped
of
every
branch
so
that
it
looked
like
a
broken
column
on
its
top
sat
a
great
vulture
in
the
attitude
of
its
kind
as
motionless
as
rock
and
apparently
meditating
on
the
incongruity
of
a
noisy
vulgar
bit
of
machinery
with
its
train
of
cars
invading
such
a
nook
of
solitudes
as
we
proceeded
we
came
upon
the
succession
of
placer
gold
diggings
known
as
the
hydraulic
mines
which
were
then
for
the
most
part
abandoned
and
these
brought
to
my
remembrance
many
similar
spots
i
had
seen
in
australia
the
of
the
mines
had
stopped
up
or
diverted
or
otherwise
interfered
with
the
sacramento
river
the
bear
river
and
other
rivers
to
the
great
detriment
of
agriculture
horticulture
stock
rearing
whereupon
the
state
legislature
of
california
passed
an
act
to
prohibit
all
interference
with
the
water
for
without
water
the
miners
could
not
wash
their
dirt
and
so
had
to
abandon
the
diggings
all
around
this
part
ravine
followed
ravine
with
beautiful
vistas
between
affording
a
continuous
luxury
of
scenic
gratification
presently
we
reached
what
is
called
by
many
the
grandest
scenery
on
the
american
continent
known
as
cape
horn
it
is
where
the
train
winds
round
a
mountain
side
on
a
narrow
ledge
and
at
such
a
height
that
to
hold
one
hand
out
of
the
window
would
be
to
hold
it
over
a
sheer
precipice
of
feet
the
train
runs
along
the
ledge
or
narrow
roadway
cut
in
the
face
of
the
mountain
rock
and
all
around
is
presented
a
spectacle
of
the
majesty
of
nature
which
only
such
a
range
of
mountains
as
the
sierra
nevada
could
produce
about
miles
from
truckee
we
reach
a
station
called
summit
which
lies
at
an
elevation
of
feet
and
is
the
highest
point
on
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
reached
by
railroads
but
the
granite
peaks
rise
up
to
an
altitude
of
over
feet
grizzly
bears
and
other
wild
creatures
find
their
homes
in
the
recesses
of
these
fastnesses
on
leaving
these
mountains
we
make
a
rapid
descent
and
in
an
hour
feel
that
we
are
in
another
country
at
colfax
i
bought
fruit
at
arlington
the
temperature
was
like
summer
at
rockling
station
i
saw
some
very
fine
orange
trees
full
of
splendid
fruit
now
we
have
entered
the
fertile
plains
of
north
california
and
run
through
cultivated
lands
till
we
reach
sacramento
the
capital
of
the
state
it
is
a
great
change
from
desert
alkaline
plains
miles
of
snow
sheds
mountains
a
and
a
freezing
atmosphere
we
find
ourselves
in
a
warm
genial
climate
cultivated
farms
vineyards
gardens
and
orchards
of
nectarines
pears
apples
and
the
rest
arriving
at
oakland
we
crossed
the
bay
in
the
great
or
floating
wharf
piedmont
the
weather
was
charming
the
bay
dotted
about
with
islands
and
surrounded
by
hills
the
temperature
was
the
more
enjoyable
from
the
fact
that
only
a
few
hours
before
we
were
surrounded
by
deep
snow
on
arriving
at
san
francisco
on
saturday
december
i
went
straight
to
the
palace
hotel
and
my
first
effort
was
to
get
a
bath
for
a
continuous
day
and
night
run
from
new
york
of
miles
makes
one
who
is
accustomed
to
the
use
of
plenty
of
water
to
look
for
a
good
ablution
as
the
first
refresher
the
palace
hotel
claims
to
be
the
model
hotel
of
the
world
its
architect
visited
the
leading
hotels
of
europe
so
as
to
produce
a
hotel
superior
to
any
as
to
size
it
occupies
a
complete
block
that
is
it
has
a
street
traversing
each
side
of
it
it
rises
to
a
height
of
feet
and
covers
an
area
feet

that
is
square

or
nearly
acres
and
with
extensions
exceeds
three
acres
the
lower
story
is

high
the
uppermost
one
feet
high
the
foundation
wall
is
feet
thick
and
the
principal
materials
are
stone
iron

and
marble
every
partition
wall
throughout
is

it
is

proof
the

being
additionally
tied
by
iron

it
has
four
artesian
wells
yielding
gallons
of
water
an
hour
a
gallon
reservoir
and
tanks
holding
gallons
more
the
water
is
served
by
three
large
steam
fire
pumps
which
throw
the
water
above
the
roof
there
are
five
patent
hydraulic
elevators
or
lifts
immense
precautions
have
been
taken
against
fire
the
are
feet

and

the
public
rooms
are
very
numerous
and
are
of
immense
size
the
rooms
for
guests
are
principally
feet
by

none
are
less
than
feet
by

all
are
well
furnished
the
corridors
are
like
streets
space
elegance
solidity
and
comfort
are
apparent
everywhere
the
whole
being
lighted
by

each

has

to

and
which
can
only
be
used
by
the
occupant
of
the
the
hotel
of
course
has
a
barber
shop
and
as
i
expected
my
client
to
call
i
was
anxious
to
get
through
my
toilet
quickly
so
i
rang
for
one
of
the
barber
assistants
to
come
to
my
to
cut
my
hair
preparatory
to
the
bath
this
did
not
take
long
and
i
asked
the
price
when
to
my
surprise
a
dollar
and
was
required
i
thought
it
was
barbarism
indeed
i
left
san
francisco
on
monday
december
and
during
my
short
stay
i
saw
something
of
the
town
but
it
was
not
the
same
place
as
i
remembered
it
from
my
two
visits
to
it
in
it
is
full
of
life
and
activity
has
many
wealthy
men
of
whom
it
is
said
are
millionaires
it
has
a
large
number
of
grand
buildings
fine
shops
extensive
markets
beautiful
private
residences
and
an
immense
development
of
electricity
for
motion
light
sound
etc
the
run
in
constant
succession
everywhere
but
the
most
remarkable
cars
are
those
worked
by
an
endless
cable
in
the
city
are
works
with
immense
steam
power
and
from
these
works
endless
cables
revolve
throughout
the
city
under
the
roads
in
various
directions
in
the
bed
of
the
tramway
is
a
groove
under
which
is
the
cable
revolving
at
a
great
speed
the
driver
of
the
car
lets
down
his
grip
which
tightly
holds
the
cable
and
of
course
the
car
starts
at
full
speed
and
is
carried
along
by
the
cable
when
the
driver
wants
to
stop
he
lets
go
his
grip
on
the
cable
and
applies
his
brake
some
of
the
hills
in
san
francisco
are
very
steep
and
the
first
sensation
in
riding
on
the
outside
front
seat
while
going
full
speed
down
a
sharp
declivity
is
certainly
novel
with
no
apparent
motive
power
and
no
apparent
means
of
stopping
the
speed
of
course
is
always
the
same
whether
up
or
down

or
on
level

a
san

sunday
is
painful
to
one
accustomed
to
our
english
ways
travelling
in
every
form
and
buying
and
selling
are
very
prevalent
the
have
a
large
building
there
and
get
large
meetings
i
attended
one
gathering
which
i
addressed
shortly
san
francisco
is
described
as
having
the
mildest
and
most
equable
climate
known
to
any
large
city
in
the
world
january
is
the
coldest
month
and
the
mean
temperature
then
is
stated
to
be
september
is
the
hottest
month
and
the
mean
temperature
then
is
stated
to
be
thus
only
difference
between
the
coldest
and
warmest
months
and
the
average
for
the
whole
year
is
san
francisco
has
a
population
of
about
including
some
chinese
is
the
principal
city
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
principal
commercial
centre
on
the
pacific
coast
i
must
not
however
dwell
longer
on
this
part
of
my
journey
on
monday
december
i
left
san
francisco
with
one
of
my
clients
huffman
for
merced
by
the
train
the
sun
was
shining
gloriously
producing
a
charming
effect
upon
the
placid
waters
of
the
bay
and
its
beautiful
surrounding
hills
san
francisco
to
new
orleans
the
train
reached
merced
at
on
monday
night
december
where
i
was
met
and
in
a
spacious
family
buggy
drawn
by
a
pair
of
good
horses
i
was
very
soon
at
the
residence
of
my
client
huffman
the
continuous
day
and
night
travelling
by
rail
and
the
taking
of
voluminous
notes
all
along
had
caused
a
constant
excitement
which
told
upon
the
nerves
and
for
two
days
i
felt
as
though
i
needed
absolute
rest
but
remembering
that
i
had
already
been
long
absent
from
my
office
i
commenced
my
work
at
merced
the
next
morning
the
town
of
merced
is
the
capital
of
the
county
of
that
name
it
is
not
many
years
old
but
it
has
a
striking
difference
to
many
new
small
towns
i
have
seen
in
the
colonies
in
that
it
has
several
very
good
buildings
and
residences
it
has
seven
churches
and
chapels
of
various
denominations
some
good
shops
medical
men
society
schools
gas
water
electricity
and
a
station
on
the
main
great
southern
pacific
railway
it
is
undoubtedly
a
town
which
must
rapidly
increase
in
value
for
this
reason
my
clients
crocker
and
huffman
at
a
cost
of
some
two
million
dollars
have
tapped
the
great
merced
river
miles
off
and
brought
water
down
to
the
town
and
irrigated
the
country
round
they
have
formed
a
reservoir
acres
in
extent
hitherto
the
rich
lands
around
the
town
of
merced
have
not
been
irrigated
and
consequently
were
not
suitable
for
growing
the
fruits
for
which
california
is
so
famous
but
now
that
a
system
of
canals
formed
by
my
clients
has
irrigated
their
estate
extending
over
some
or
acres
the
whole
of
this
great
area
is
changed
in
value
and
is
available
and
will
eventually
be
used
for
the
production
of
choice
fruits
thus
merced
will
become
a
centre
like
other
parts
of
california
and
being
so
much
nearer
than
those
other
parts
to
san
francisco
will
benefit
additionally
by
that
advantage
alone
merced
is
only
miles
from
san
francisco
while
fresno
is
bakersfield
and
los
angeles
miles
it
is
rumoured
that
another
line
of
railway
will
also
be
formed
in
connection
with
the
present
main
line
and
merced
would
then
be
an
important
railway
junction
i
drove
out
every
day
with
huffman
and
inspected
the
country
for
some
miles
around
the
town
including
the
merced
river
miles
off
the
land
designated
british
colony
is
at
its
commencement
only
two
miles
from
the
merced
railway
station
hotel
and
shops
huffman
has
a
most
comfortable
residence
and
has
excellent
stables
well
filled
with
buggy
horses
so
that
travelling
was
always
an
easy
matter
being
a
lay
preacher
in
england
i
took
advantage
of
offers
made
me
and
preached
on
the
sunday
i
was
at
merced
in
two
of
the
churches
at
the
morning
and
evening
services
i
left
merced
on
tuesday
night
december
by
the
train
having
stayed
there
eight
days
i
immediately
turned
in
and
next
morning
december
was
up
as
usual
at
and
much
enjoyed
the
splendid
scenery
through
which
we
were
passing
in
a
mountainous
country
grandly
diversified
with
all
the
alternations
of
heights
and
depths
lights
and
darks
rich
and
barren
including
many
evidences
of
engineering
skill
as
we
coursed
along
now
looking
high
up
now
looking
low
down
and
presently
winding
along
the
celebrated
loop
described
as
the
greatest
engineering
feat
in
the
world
by
which
the
train
goes
through
mountain
passes
creeping
along
the
tops
of
eminences
then
returning
crosses
under
itself
at
a
low
level
then
ascending
crosses
over
itself
at
a
higher
level
so
that
in
its
meandering
course
you
now
look
down
at
your
side
on
the
line
you
have
just
traversed
and
anon
look
up
at
your
side
at
the
line
you
are
about
to
traverse
we
passed
through
the
mojava
pronounced
moharvie
desert
where
the
yucca
palm
is
plentiful
a
fellow
passenger
and
old
settler
enlivened
the
time
by
some
relations
of
his
experiences
thus
he
once
shot
a
grizzly
bear
which
weighed
lbs
some
are
much
larger
than
this
everything
of
weight
in
america
is
generally
reckoned
by
pounds
not
cwts
or
tons
on
another
occasion
he
slew
a
californian
lion
he
had
killed
a
bullock
and
the
carcase
was
hanging
in
his
house
at
the
back
where
was
an
aperture
like
a
small
window
without
glass
and
under
this
opening
outside
stood
an
empty
case
the
lion
scenting
the
carcase
and
hearing
no
sound
from
within
approached
the
house
and
was
endeavouring
to
creep
through
the
aperture
when
in
its
efforts
to
do
so
it
kicked
the
case
away
and
the
poor
animal
was
stuck
fast
having
its
head
and
shoulders
inside
my
fellow
traveller
on
returning
home
was
surprised
to
find
his
visitor
and
so
despatched
him
with
an
axe
and
has
for
years
used
the
skin
which
is
feet
inches
long
the
temperature
was
charming
although
in
the
distance
we
could
see
the
mountains
we
run
through
the
antelope
valley
gather
some
juniper
plant
see
a
skunk
see
natural
oil
wells
at
saugus
pass
the
head
of
the
santa
clara
valley
see
the
san
fernando
mountains
go
through
the
greatest
tunnel
in
america
the
san
fernando
tunnel
feet
long
go
by
burbank
where
there
is
a
land
boom
and
arrive
at
los
angeles
where
during
the
two
hours
of
waiting
i
have
a
look
at
the
town
and
a
pleasant
chat
with
white
mortimer
the
british
consul
whom
i
called
upon
the
next
day
december
we
were
on
the
desert
of
arizona
where
we
saw
indian
camps
at
places
which
were
somewhat
oases
as
to
plant
life
speaking
generally
nothing
grows
on
a
great
part
of
this
desert
but
cactus
of
which
i
am
told
there
are
some
varieties
from
the
dwarf
kind
to
trees
feet
high
this
plant
has
a
strange
if
not
a
weird
appearance
here
and
there
like
solitary
sentinels
stands
out
a
tall
cactus
with
perhaps
two
or
three
heads
or
branches
growing
perpendicularly
with
itself
the
mountains
on
either
side
look
as
if
they
had
their
origin
in
volcanic
eruptions
some
parts
of
the
desert
are
covered
with
a
dwarf
kind
of
evergreen
shrub
we
see
large
numbers
of
prairie
dogs
which
are
of
a
size
between
a
rat
and
a
rabbit
they
live
in
holes
like
rabbits
there
are
also
gophers
skunks
prairie
rats
rattlesnakes
and
hawks
which
feed
on
snakes
and
rats
we
pass
tribes
of
yuma
indians
aztec
indians
and
gila
pronounced
heela
indians
on
reaching
a
part
where
is
some
grass
we
see
some
cattle
which
are
straying
on
the
line
the
engine
whistle
shrieks
the
cattle
run
and
some
coyote
wolves
are
startled
from
their
lairs
and
run
too
large
numbers
are
here
and
the
preceding
night
their
yells
aroused
some
passengers
from
sleep
as
we
proceed
quail
are
seen
and
wild
cats
something
like
a
lynx
arriving
at
tucson
pronounced
tewsohn
i
enquired
for
a
gentleman
to
whom
i
had
an
introduction
but
learned
that
he
was
up
at
his
gold
mine
this
tucson
is
an
ancient
city
having
been
founded
by
the
jesuits
in
it
does
a
large
business
in
exporting
gold
dust
wool
and
hides
i
expect
that
these
mountains
of
arizona
contain
much
value
in
minerals
the
indians
in
this
part
of
the
country
are
the
apaches
and
were
described
to
me
as
the
most
treacherous
of
all
the
american
indians
that
they
are
cowardly
and
will
never
fight
in
the
open
a
gentleman
who
entered
the
train
at
tucson
gave
me
many
instances
of
this
in
the
evening
we
saw
round
their
fire
camping
out
in
the
open
and
also
a
camp
of
freighters
resting
on
their
journey
across
the
desert
the
next
morning
early
december
we
arrived
at
el
paso
a
most
interesting
mexican
town
situate
on
the
borders
of
old
mexico
new
mexico
and
texas
where
i
bought
the
skin
of
a
mexican
tiger
and
other
things
in
travelling
for
some
days
in
a
train
continuously
one
feels
the
need
of
exercise
and
this
i
obtained
by
getting
in
and
out
of
many
of
the
railway
stations
and
walking
up
and
down
between
san
francisco
and
new
orleans
there
are
stations
and
i
should
suppose
the
number
of
stations
on
both
the
northern
and
southern
routes
i
traversed
would
probably
amount
to
nearly
we
are
now
commencing
to
cross
the
great
plains
of
texas
at
first
the
plains
are
desert
with
mountains
skirting
our
view
the
scenery
is
less
interesting
than
the
arizona
desert
because
there
are
no
cacti
this
desert
has
probably
been
under
salt
water
at
some
time
the
rocky
hills
appear
to
have
a
volcanic
origin
as
we
go
on
we
reach
a
poor
kind
of
pasture
growing
out
of
a
scrubby
kind
of
shrub
with
some
occasional
cacti
many
hills
and
mountains
like
barren
rocks
with
not
a
bird
or
an
animal
to
be
seen
the
weather
has
been
warm
since
leaving
merced
but
now
so
far
south
as
we
are
it
is
hot
on
this
december
day
i
had
read
in
the
short
telegrams
given
by
american
papers
that
the
winter
was
very
severe
in
england
and
i
pictured
often
to
myself
friends
and
clients
in
england
muffled
up
amidst
frost
and
snow
whilst
i
was
revelling
in
glorious
sunshine
so
warm
that
no
greatcoat
could
be
worn
had
i
returned
by
the
route
i
went
the
northern
prairies
i
might
have
been
delayed
by
snow
drifts
but
by
this
the
southern
route
there
was
no
snow
but
a
continuous
cheerful
delightful
sunshine
not
too
hot
anywhere
but
simply
delightful
i
should
certainly
recommend
anyone
going
from
england
to
california
in
the
winter
season
to
go
by
the
southern
route
amongst
the
objects
of
interest
we
notice
in
the
distance
a
small
herd
of
wild
antelope
trotting
along
cattle
coyote
wolves
and
at
many
places
the
bones
of
animals
which
had
dropped
dead
or
when
weak
had
been
killed
or
eaten
by
carnivora
or
reptiles
we
saw
large
numbers
of
prairie
dogs
they
sit
outside
their
holes
like
a
squirrel
on
their
haunches
with
their
fore
paws
up
they
are
very
quick
and
most
difficult
even
to
shoot
more
antelopes
and
coyotes
at
a
station
called
alpine
were
several
cowboys
all
armed
with
revolvers
and
cartridge
belts
and
some
with
dagger
knives
too
their
mustangs
were
hitched
up
close
by
these
cowboys
are
some
old
and
some
young
men
some
wild
and
some
cultivated
some
never
educated
some
have
gone
through
harvard
or
oxford
or
cambridge
some
the
sons
of
english
county
gentlemen
and
noblemen
but
all
cowboys
men
who
live
on
ranches
where
large
herds
of
cattle
or
horses
are
bred
and
whose
duty
it
is
to
ride
over
the
wild
rough
country
to
know
where
the
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
are
feeding
so
that
if
they
need
to
be
ridden
up
for
cutting
or
branding
or
selling
they
may
be
found
i
was
told
that
this
was
one
of
the
hardest
places
for
a
cowboy
one
of
the
wickedest
meaning
that
when
they
visit
it
it
is
for
a
spree
and
they
get
drunk
and
fights
and
murders
follow
i
was
pointed
to
a
little
cemetery
on
a
hill
enclosed
by
a
white
fence
and
was
told
that
it
contained
bodies
and
that
only
had
died
a
natural
death
the
others
had
been
shot
or
otherwise
murdered
in
drunken
frays
and
other
ways
many
strange
little
histories
were
told
me
about
these
men
but
which
i
have
no
time
to
record
here
in
some
parts
of
the
country
where
water
was
very
scarce
there
seemed
to
be
no
vegetation
and
the
cattle
seemed
to
wander
solitarily
along
a
mere
heap
of
hide
and
bone
at
many
stations
i
had
quite
a
considerable
interval
for
running
about
such
as
when
a
wheel
caught
fire
which
happened
two
or
three
times
or
some
freight
had
to
be
taken
in
or
taken
out
etc
when
the
train
again
starts
the
conductors
shout
all
aboard
and
there
is
a
general
rush
the
next
day
december
was
again
a
brilliant
day
of
sunshine
we
see
many
buzzards
and
breakfast
at
san
antonio
the
railway
stations
along
this
country
have
two
roofs
one
being
two
or
three
feet
above
the
other
so
that
air
between
should
keep
the
building
cool
at
breakfast
i
read
the
san
antonio
which
informed
me
severe
storms
prevailed
everywhere
in
great
britain
and
my
thoughts
were
naturally
much
occupied
with
the
old
country
the
day
was
sultry
but
sunshine
is
always
a
great
treat
to
me
and
it
was
never
too
hot
now
we
are
running
into
civilization
again
and
i
catch
sight
of
a
man
ploughing
he
has
a
pair
of
mules
and
is
holding
the
reins
in
his
teeth
as
we
proceed
it
is
a
continuous
succession
of
cotton
fields
cotton
fields
cotton
fields
we
see
many
bales
these
weigh
from
to
lbs
each
at
a
station
called
sequin
i
obtained
lots
of
cotton
seeds
and
gathered
some
cotton
in
the
fields
as
we
went
along
the
scavengers
of
this
country
are
turkey
buzzards
which
are
protected
by
law
because
of
their
usefulness
i
could
not
refrain
from
writing
several
times
in
my
glorious
sunshine
hitherto
we
have
had
mountains
continuously
in
sight
but
now
they
are
out
of
vision
this
being
saturday
we
see
markets
at
the
towns
we
go
through
at
habwood
and
flatonia
especially
was
this
noticeable
the
population
seemed
almost
altogether
negro
i
observed
a
negro
and
his
wife
well
dressed
riding
on
horseback
in
the
old
english
pillion
style
another
negro
and
his
wife
and
about
twelve
children
in
a
capacious
kind
of
and
many
negroes
and
negresses
the
latter
dressed
in
white
and
gay
colours
standing
at
their
pretty
verandahed
cottages
we
now
pass
a
spot
where
a
train
was
stopped
and
the
passengers
robbed
some
time
ago
by
jesse
and
frank
jeames
and
the
ford
brothers
the
is
for
all
the
men
to
be
secreted
but
one
who
stands
on
the
line
holding
up
a
red
flag
which
indicates
danger
the
engineer
then
stops
and
the
men
spring
aboard
some
hold
revolvers
to
the
heads
of
the
engineers
and
others
go
through
the
train
and
rob
the
passengers
the
robbers
shout
out
hands
up
and
one
man
points
his
weapon
at
the
passenger
head
whilst
another
rifles
his
pockets
if
a
passenger
fails
to
hold
up
his
hands
he
is
shot
down
a
passenger
on
the
northern
prairies
told
me
of
a
fellow
passenger
who
under
such
circumstances
having
a
revolver
aimed
at
a
robber
and
pulled
the
trigger
but
it
missed
fire
and
he
was
instantly
shot
down
but
these
attacks
are
now
more
rare
and
the
officials
are
more
prepared
for
them
sometimes
the
robbers
get
on
board
the
train
as
passengers
and
act
suddenly
in
concert
all
along
the
country
now
we
pass
the
cabins
of
the
slaves
familiarised
to
us
by
uncle
tom
cabin
these
cabins
are
pleasant
little
houses
with
verandahs
and
i
reflected
how
favourably
they
compared
with
the
homes
of
many
of
the
london
poor
and
how
happy
the
slaves
might
have
been
but
for
the
knowledge
that
at
any
time
they
were
liable
to
be
sold
like
a
mule
or
a
bullock
now
we
pass
sugar
cotton
and
rice
plantations
and
go
through
such
cultivations
all
through
louisiana
mississippi
alabama
north
and
south
carolina
georgia
and
virginia
i
gathered
sugar
and
cotton
going
along
at
places
saw
a
racoon
in
a
stream
fishing
for
crawfish
and
go
through
a
country
in
which
are
plenty
of
alligators
on
the
early
morning
of
sunday
december
we
go
through
swamps
such
as
we
used
to
read
of
as
the
of
runaway
slaves
all
through
these
southern
states
we
saw
everywhere
sugar
and
cotton
sugar
and
cotton
sugar
and
cotton
these
with
rice
are
the
principal
products
sugar
mills
cotton
yards
etc
we
soon
reach
algiers
and
cross
the
grand
mississippi
river
then
land
at
new
orleans
the
actual
city
of
new
orleans
covers
an
area
of
about
square
miles
but
the
statutory
limits
of
the
city
embrace
nearly
square
miles
it
is
situate
on
both
banks
of
the
mississippi
river
and
from
to
steamers
and
other
vessels
from
all
parts
of
the
world
may
frequently
be
seen
lying
there
new
orleans
is
the
chief
market
in
the
world
for
cotton
the
site
of
the
city
was
surveyed
in
by
de
la
tour
and
it
was
settled
in
but
abandoned
in
consequence
of
overflows
storms
and
sickness
it
was
resettled
in
held
by
the
french
till
then
by
the
spaniards
till
by
the
french
again
till
and
then
with
the
province
of
louisiana
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
the
present
population
is
about
there
are
cemeteries
and
they
are
remarkable
inasmuch
as
the
bodies
are
buried
above
ground
in
vaults
like
tiers
of
ovens
the
ground
is
too
wet
for
burial
i
attended
trinity
church
in
the
morning
had
some
black
bear
for
dinner
at
my
hotel
the
hotel
charles
and
then
attended
the
where
i
gave
the
address
in
the
afternoon
which
was
followed
by
a
very
solemn
after
meeting
i
went
to
bed
very
early
and
was
up
very
early
the
next
morning
monday
december
i
had
to
draw
the
mosquito
curtains
in
the
night
but
not
till
after
some
of
these
insects
had
left
their
mark
the
principal
ground
floor
of
the
hotel
was
on
the
first
floor
level
and
the
actual
ground
floor
was
of
secondary
importance
the
front
part
was
occupied
by
stone
steps
and
a
colonnade
and
the
rear
was
a
liquor
bar
and
a
large
hall
this
hall
used
to
be
one
of
the
principal
auction
rooms
of
the
city
where
slaves
were
sold
by
auction
and
as
i
entered
the
now
rather
place
which
is
partly
circular
in
shape
and
constructed
with
many
pillar
supports
i
pictured
to
myself
the
emotional
agonies
the
tempests
of
passion
the
lust
of
greed
the
calm
subdued
resistless
attitude
of
despair
which
at
times
found
expression
as
domestic
circles
were
for
ever
broken
tenderest
sympathies
for
ever
sundered
closest
friendships
for
ever
separated
yea
even
the
most
sacred
relationships
of
life
ruthlessly
shattered
by
the
sale
of
mothers
or
fathers
brothers
or
sisters
wives
or
husbands
sweethearts
or
friends
of
this
i
will
give
just
two
illustrations
our
porter
on
the
train
crossing
the
northern
prairies
was
a
coloured
man
named
farrell
he
told
me
that
his
mother
had
seven
boys
and
that
they
were
all
sold
away
from
her
and
that
it
had
been
his
to
try
to
find
his
brothers
he
had
shipped
to
australia
as
a
seaman
had
worked
in
hotels
and
on
wharves
and
rivers
and
now
was
working
on
the
railway
cars
endeavouring
to
find
his
brothers
he
had
advertised
for
them
in
the
newspapers
but
he
had
never
heard
of
one
of
them
when
this
family
was
broken
up
farrell
and
his
brothers
were
only
boys
for
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
date
of
the
official
announcement
of
the
total
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
united
states
was
made
on
the
december
when
upwards
of
slaves
were
legally
declared
free
men
another
coloured
man
engaged
at
this
hotel
who
was
born
a
slave
remembered
walking
with
his
father
who
was
also
a
slave
and
his
father
anxiety
to
get
home
before
nine
at
night
as
no
coloured
man
was
allowed
to
be
in
the
streets
after
that
hour
unless
he
possessed
a
sufficient
authority
from
his
owner
this
man
told
me
that
at
an
auction
of
slaves
at
this
hotel
auctions
of
slaves
were
held
in
new
orleans
at
different
places
three
times
a
week
a
very
fine
intelligent
young
man
was
sold
by
auction
for
dollars
to
a
lawyer
who
was
known
to
be
a
cruel
man
my
informant
told
me
that
his
name
was
well
it
sounded
like
rumo
possibly
roumeaux
as
most
of
the
wealthy
settlers
were
of
french
origin
that
he
lived
in
ward
and
that
when
he
bought
slaves
and
sent
them
down
to
his
plantations
they
each
received
lashes
as
they
entered
his
gates
as
an
example
of
what
they
would
receive
if
they
did
not
please
him
well
when
the
hammer
fell
and
this
slave
knew
that
he
belonged
to
an
owner
whose
cruelty
was
common
talk
he
exclaimed
you
have
lost
your
money
this
slave
was
sent
down
with
others
to
the
steamer
on
the
mississippi
which
is
only
some
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
hotel
for
shipment
to
this
owner
plantations
the
poor
fellow
was
not
even
allowed
to
say
to
his
people
but
was
sent
on
board
when
he
arrived
there
he
repeated
to
the
man
in
charge
of
the
slaves
rumo
will
lose
his
money
and
shortly
after
he
took
advantage
of
a
favourable
moment
and
folding
his
arms
he
threw
himself
backward
into
the
river
and
was
drowned
a
few
minutes
walk
from
my
hotel
is
the
henry
clay
monument
where
the
mob
was
addressed
last
month
by
parkerson
who
incited
them
to
proceed
to
the
prison
and
force
an
entrance
and
then
to
take
the
lives
of
a
number
of
italian
murderers
by
lynch
law
on
this
monument
some
memorable
words
are
inscribed
which
clay
uttered
and
which
t
copied
they
are
as
follows
if
i
could
be
instrumental
in
eradicating
this
deep
stain
slavery
from
the
character
of
our
country
i
would
not
exchange
the
proud
satisfaction
which
i
should
enjoy
for
the
honour
of
all
the
triumphs
ever
decreed
to
the
most
successful
conqueror
that
deep
stain
was
removed
in
and
slaves
were
raised
from
the
condition
of
cattle
to
that
of
men
who
could
thenceforward
rejoice
in
the
freedom
of
being
masters
of
their
own
bodies
new
orleans
to
london
on
leaving
new
orleans
we
run
through
swamps
and
presently
skirt
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
travel
on
the
next
day
december
we
feel
it
perceptibly
colder
for
we
are
going
north
the
country
is
cultivated
in
sugar
cotton
rice
grass
etc
we
breakfast
at
atlanta
and
after
leaving
that
place
the
scenery
puts
me
more
in
mind
of
england
in
going
through
georgia
i
was
told
that
the
same
black
families
which
now
occupy
many
of
the
small
wooden
houses
or
cabins
which
i
see
are
the
same
families
who
occupied
them
before
the
abolition
of
slavery
although
many
slaves
suffered
cruelties
through
enforced
separations
and
hard
treatment
yet
very
many
had
most
comfortable
homes
considerate
masters
and
light
work
i
sat
much
during
this
day
on
the
platform
at
the
end
of
the
end
car
observing
the
country
at
one
station
some
little
black
urchins
came
to
gaze
and
i
said
to
one
boy
apparently
seven
years
old
what
is
your
name
he
said
willie
matthews
i
said
how
old
are
you
he
said
i
ai
old
enough
to
know
how
old
i
are
and
his
genuine
simplicity
delighted
me
we
are
now
passing
through
cultivated
lands
farms
and
estates
and
these
continue
right
on
to
new
york
at
greers
was
a
very
large
collection
of
cotton
at
spartanville
are
large
cotton
mills
such
as
one
sees
in
lancashire
the
next
day
december
we
notice
ice
on
the
ponds
we
cross
the
potomac
river
and
near
washington
sight
the
capitol
or
as
we
should
say
in
england
the
houses
of
parliament
washington
city
is
the
political
capital
of
the
united
states
its
size
is
about
miles
by
miles
the
capitol
is
described
by
the
americans
as
the
most
magnificent
public
edifice
in
the
world
it
is
feet
long
and
feet
deep
with
two
wings
each
by
feet
its
entire
length
is
feet
inches
and
it
covers
an
area
of
more
than
acres
it
is
of
costly
construction
and
stands
in
grounds
of
about
acres
we
proceed
and
stop
at
baltimore
cross
the
bush
and
gunpowder
rivers
again
come
near
the
susquehanna
and
delaware
rivers
various
smaller
rivers
and
run
on
until
we
reach
new
york
on
arrival
i
immediately
went
to
the
cunard
office
and
secured
my
berth
in
the
servia
the
next
morning
christmas
day
it
was
very
cold
and
snowing
i
had
a
fire
lit
in
my
and
there
wrote
the
article
which
appeared
in
the
january
in
the
afternoon
i
walked
in
the
central
park
but
it
was
so
bitterly
cold
i
was
satisfied
with
less
than
two
hours
of
exercise
and
returned
to
the
hotel
to
dinner
and
finished
up
the
day
writing
in
my
till
midnight
the
central
park
in
genial
weather
would
be
an
attractive
resort
i
observed
large
natural
rocks
lawns
wide
promenades
seats
lakes
menageries
swings
and
various
such
like
attractions
for
juveniles
overground
and
underground
roads
a
kind
of
rotten
row
but
being
so
cold
scarcely
a
person
was
to
be
seen
on
december
new
york
was
deep
in
snow
i
visited
a
few
shops
for
some
necessaries
and
went
on
board
the
servia
during
the
afternoon
thinking
that
i
might
have
difficulty
in
getting
a
cabman
to
drive
to
the
docks
after
dark
if
the
snow
drifted
deeply
new

on

about
in

we
began
to
clear
out

and
in
a
few
hours
were
again
on
the
broad

the
next

we
had
service
on

conducted
by
the
doctor
in

all
on

not
actually

attend
we
left
new
york
in
a
blizzard
and
our
decks
were
coated
with
frost
and
snow
but
after
two
days
this
was
all
cleared
away
and
we
had
a
splendid
run
in
genial
weather
so
that
one
day
i
could
comfortably
walk
on
deck
without
a
greatcoat

the

is
a
fine

but
much
older

i
must
conclude
with
some
general
remarks
the
recently
published
a
series
of
ten
articles
on
the
negro
question
in
the
united
states
and
from
them
it
appears
that
the
position
of
that
country
is
very
serious
in
this
relation
these
articles
commenced
after
i
had
started
on
my
journey
so
that
i
only
saw
one
or
two
of
the
concluding
ones
and
the
leader
upon
the
whole
but
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
them
because
in
passing
through
the
states
which
are
principally
peopled
by
negroes
i
heard
something
about
the
matter
from
a
thoughtful
man
who
regarded
the
subject
with
great
gravity
the
has
shown
that
the
attitude
of
one
race
to
the
other
is
that
of
antagonism
discontent
and
perpetual
danger
the
negroes
have
the
same
constitutional
privileges
as
the
whites
and
their
overpowering
numbers
in
certain
places
give
the
power
into
their
hands
which
regarded
in
relation
to
racial
hatred
renders
them
to
be
an
object
of
danger
to
the
country
it
is
proposed
to
emigrate
the
negroes
to
some
part
of
africa
it
would
be
more
consistent
for
certain
americans
to
interest
themselves
in
solving
this
problem
of
their
own
rather
than
encouraging
irish
agitators
and
so
assisting
to
prevent
england
solving
her
dark
problem
across
george
channel
the
proportion
of
coloured
people
to
white
in
the
three
states
of
georgia
louisiana
and
alabama
is
about
equal
that
is
there
are
as
many
coloured
people
as
white
the
population
of
coloured
people
throughout
the
whole
of
the
united
states
is
about
of
coloured
people
to
of
white
people
but
it
is
a
sad
fact
as
stated
in
the
of
march
last
that
a
government
return
dated
june
showed
that
there
were
convicts
in
the
prisons
of
the
united
states
and
that
of
this
number
no
less
than
or
were
coloured
people
and
that
out
of
these
coloured
people
only
were
chinese
japanese
and
indians
so
that
were
negroes
as
the
whites
counting
all
the
states
are
eight
times
as
numerous
as
the
coloured
people
and
yet
the
coloured
convicts
are
of
the
whole
it
speaks
badly
for
the
morals
of
the
negro
race
in
america
i
was
much
struck
with
the
immense
development
of
electricity
steamers
railway
carriages
tramcars
hotels
shops
towns
villages
and
railway
stations
even
those
in
remote
places
with
scarcely
a
building
near
to
them
were
all
well
lighted
by
electricity
railways
run
on
scaffoldings
down
the
centre
of
the
streets
and
horses
with
their
vehicles
run
underneath
them
the
railway
trains
are
well
heated
throughout
by
hot
water
pipes
every
class
and
reflect
a
grave
reproach
on
our
country
where
in
the
severest
weather
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
foot
warmer
except
by
certain
main
line
trains
and
even
then
one
is
expected
to
tip
the
attendant
poor
persons
travelling
in
thin
garments
and
poorly
fed
in
severe
weather
scarcely
ever
dare
to
ask
for
a
foot
warmer
unless
they
are
prepared
to
fee
someone
and
whether
rich
or
poor
no
one
can
get
a
foot
warmer
at
any
of
our
country
stations
when
we
consider
that
railways
originated
in
this
country
and
that
some
of
the
parts
of
america
i
passed
through
were
some
some
and
some
even
years
ago
only
known
to
the
trapper
and
the
indian
it
shows
the
increase
of
enterprise
exhibited
by
our
cousins
over
the
atlantic
tramcars
are
worked
by
electricity
by
steam
by
horses
and
mules
and
by
revolving
endless
cables
telephones
are
everywhere
the
railway
journeys
in
america
often
occupying
several
days
the
tickets
are
a
kind
of
succession
of
coupons
parts
of
which
have
to
be
given
up
at
various
stages
caution
is
exercised
in
selling
railway
tickets
for
long
journeys
thus
you
are
required
to
sign
the
ticket
and
observations
are
made
of
you
such
as
your
height
probable
age
colour
of
your
eyes
hair
etc
some
of
the
lines
of
railway
are
not
fenced
in
not
even
in
towns
so
that
the
train
runs
through
a
town
as
openly
as
does
an
omnibus
i
may
convey
some
idea
of
some
of
the
large
american
systems
of
agriculture
by
referring
to
the
estate
of
one
of
my
clients
huffman
of
merced
california
this
gentleman
has
fields
ranging
from
to
acres
each
he
can
plough
to
acres
a
day
by
his
traction
engine
he
can
strike
furrows
at
a
time
he
can
put
teams
of
eight
mules
or
horses
each
to
work
at
one
time
each
harvester
will
cut
thrash
and
sack
an
average
of
acres
a
day
the
front
part
of
the
machine
faces
the
standing
wheat
in
the
field
in
the
centre
of
the
machine
it
is
thrashed
and
winnowed
and
at
the
rear
it
is
thrown
out
in
sacks
ready
for
market
huffman
can
sit
in
his
study
at
home
and
by
his
telephone
talk
to
his
clerks
at
merced
he
is
the
banker
there
as
well
as
to
the
foremen
at
his
various
ranches
for
miles
round
the
country
i
particularly
noticed
one
of
his
fields
of
wheat
comprising
acres
as
level
and
clean
as
a
flower
garden
in
england
the
americans
have
a
greater
variety
of
foods
served
at
their
meals
than
we
do
but
i
never
got
the
flavour
of
meat
cut
from
a
joint
to
equal
that
which
when
really
well
roasted
and
served
we
get
in
england
as
to
bread
i
never
tasted
bread
worth
the
name
from
the
time
i
left
london
to
the
time
i
returned
to
it
alike
on
the
cunard
steamers
cars
hotels
you
can
get
no
wholemeal
bread
french
and
vienna
breads
and
other
very
white
abortions
of
that
kind
are
obtainable
in
abundance
and
even
a
kind
of
brown
bread
and
graham
bread
but
good
honest
wholemeal
bread
containing
all
the
properties
of
the
full
kernel
of
the
wheat
it
is
impossible
to
get
and
this
to
me
was
a
very
great
deprivation
as
my
article
of
food
is
wholemeal
bread
the
system
of
the
custody
of
letters
at
the
large
american
hotels
appeared
to
me
rather
unsafe
a
visitor
asks
for
letters
whereupon
there
are
handed
to
him
all
the
letters
in
the
marked
with
the
initial
of
which
the
visitor
name
commences
the
visitor
then
proceeds
to
look
through
them
and
takes
what
he
chooses
and
hands
the
rest
back
the
official
is
too
busy
or
it
is
not
customary
for
him
to
look
through
them
for
the
visitor
or
even
to
watch
the
visitor
in
his
process
of
selection
i
noticed
one
gentleman
with
a
packet
of
letters
i
should
think
considerably
over
a
hundred
every
now
and
then
slip
one
into
his
breast
pocket
and
give
a
furtive
glance
which
did
not
inspire
confidence
but
probably
this
is
a
well
accustomed
habit
of
the
people
and
the
letters
perhaps
are
as
safe
as
the
newspapers
i
frequently
saw
deposited
on
the
tops
of
the
street
letter
boxes
outside
the
boxes
because
they
were
too
large
to
be
put
inside
of
course
anyone
could
have
taken
them
but
the
custom
not
to
touch
them
is
probably
honourably
recognized
the
street
letter
boxes
are
quite
small
square
boxes
not
large
pillar
boxes
as
are
ours
in
this
country
i
should
like
to
have
remarked
more
generally
on
america
but
both
time
and
space
fail
me
of
course
as
most
people
know
the
to
us
disgusting
practice
of
spitting
is
common
in
america
spittoons
are
universally
provided
in
public
and
private
places
at
merced
court
house
is
this
notice
gentlemen
will
not
and
others
should
not
spit
upon
the
floors
huge
spittoons
are
provided
there
the
awful
guttural
which
precedes
the
constant
expectoration
of
americans
is
most
trying
it
excites
in
persons
near
them
and
who
are
unaccustomed
to
it
a
sensation
of
necessity
to
vomit
as
it
conveys
a
fear
that
your
neighbour
is
about
to
vomit
over
you
it
is
not
the
excusable
expectoration
arising
from
an
accumalation
in
the
air
passages
but
a
continuous
fusilade
of
saliva
it
is
a
disgusting
practice
and
i
believe
will
die
out
in
america
as
its
citizens
travel
more
in
the
old
countries
and
become
used
to
manners
more
refined
than
such
a
one
as
this
i
observed
that
my
clients
in
california
who
have
travelled
in
europe
and
other
travelled
americans
are
not
guilty
of
this
odious
practice
i
would
say
to
englishmen
travelling
in
america
do
condescend
to
the
guessing
and
other
loose
styles
of
expression
and
do
affect
the
nasal
twang
americans
with
all
their
boast
of
one
man
being
as
good
as
another
are
greatly
pleased
to
entertain
or
travel
with
englishmen
having
a
title
and
they
pay
a
marked
respect
to
britishers
who
speak
in
a
classical
style
and
who
while
being
devoid
of
foppishness
bounce
or
vulgarity
conduct
themselves
with
a
genial
dignity
i
will
now
say
something
about
california
and
then
proceed
to
describe
the
lands
for
sale
and
the
prospects
of
those
who
will
settle
upon
them
california
lies
on
the
genial
coast
of
the
pacific
ocean
midway
between
the
too
cold
regions
of
the
north
and
the
too
hot
regions
of
the
south
to
be
exact
the
mean
temperature
in
san
francisco
in
the
month
of
january
averages
about
it
has
varied
from
to
the
record
of
years
shows
that
between
sunrise
and
sunset
it
has
not
been
so
low
as
on
more
than
days
snow
is
sometimes
seen
to
fall
but
it
melts
immediately
california
has
a
bright
genial
climate
and
is
described
as
a
sunny
land
the
early
spring
commencing
about
the
middle
of
february
and
lasting
about
six
weeks
is
a
very
pleasant
part
of
the
year
but
april
is
described
as
the
cheeriest
december
and
january
are
the
least
pleasant
because
it
is
the
rainy
and
winter
season
thunderstorms
are
rare
and
no
hurricane
has
ever
been
known
there
the
rainfall
of
california
is
about
twenty
inches
and
the
rainy
days
number
about
sixty
in
the
year
or
about
half
the
number
of
rainy
days
experienced
in
the
atlantic
states
or
central
europe
amongst
the
fruits
grown
in
abundance
are
the
orange
grape
peach
apricot
plum
cherry
apple
nectarine
fig
lemon
lime
olive
date
and
all
the
berries
of
value
besides
the
immense
growth
of
choice
and
luscious
fruits
for
which
california
is
famous
all
over
the
globe
it
claims
to
have
the
largest
milk
butter
and
cheese
dairies
in
the
world
it
is
also
renowned
for
its
mineral
riches
its
immense
mercantile
business
its
manufacturing
industries
its
production
of
wool
its
gigantic
timber
its
wealth
of
beauty
in
flowers
its
fast
horses
its
grand
scenery
embracing
lofty
mountains
deep
valleys
expansive
fertile
plains
and
all
the
variations
of
a
beautiful
country
with
many
rivers
and
a
magnificent
sea
coast
whilst
the
coast
range
and
the
slopes
of
the
sierra
offer
to
the
sportsman
such
game
in
abundance
as
grizzly
and
cinnamon
bears
and
californian
lions
there
are
also
deer
hare
rabbit
quail
large
flocks
of
wild
ducks
and
geese
and
the
rivers
afford
such
fish
as
salmon
and

san
francisco
has
been
called
a
city
of
hills
it
has
a
population
of
nearly
inhabitants
amongst
whom
are
no
less
than
its
harbour
is
known
all
over
the
globe
as
the
golden
gate
and
it
has
answered
well
to
its
name
for
an
entrance
to
its
vast
resources
has
made
the
fortune
of
multitudes
of
people
and
many
going
there
now
are
laying
the
foundations
for
future
wealth
the
lands
of
california
have
the
two
essentials
for
successful
culture
a
rich
soil
and
genial
climate
with
plenty
of
sun
yet
never
too
hot
and
never
too
cold
for
work
and
most
of
its
domestic
animals
are
never
housed
and
require
no
food
but
wild
herbage
fruit
culture
in
california
our
lands
at
merced
in
california
offer
to
gentlemen
wishing
to
make
a
first
or
a
fresh
start
in
life
a
really
good
opportunity
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
how
men
with
energy
enterprise
and
a
little
capital
can
be
content
to
sit
in
an
office
in
foggy
london
quill
driving
from
year
end
to
year
end
when
a
prospect
is
afforded
them
such
as
we
now
offer
of
establishing
a
pleasant
home
in
a
luxurious
land
with
a
sunny
genial
climate
and
within
about
a
fortnight
travel
of
england
and
where
they
would
have
the
liberty
of
being
their
own
masters
and
lay
the
foundation
of
a
future
competency
currency
as
the
currency
in
california
is
dollars
not
pounds
we
must
ask
our
readers
to
accustom
themselves
to
dollars
a
dollar
is
cents
and
roughly
speaking
a
cent
is
equivalent
to
a
halfpenny
so
that
a
dollar
would
be
worth
of
our
money
four
shillings
and
twopence
its
value
however
varies
a
few
cents
according
to
the
place
where
it
is
exchanged
bank
of
england
notes
or
pounds
are
never
worth
less
than
four
shillings
and
twopence
cents
or
halfpennies
which
of
course
is
four
dollars
and
cents
there
being
cents
in
a
dollar
the
decimal
currency
is
extremely
simple
when
once
understood
never
less
than
is
given
for
an
english
pound
but
sometimes
and
is
obtained
merced
the
lands
i
have
for
sale
are
situate
in
the
county
of
merced
in
california
about
miles
by
rail
from
the
city
of
san
francisco
they
are
designated
british
colony
and
at
the
nearest
point
are
just
one
mile
from
the
boundary
of
the
town
of
merced
and
two
miles
from
the
railway
station
hotel

two

two

the
main
one
running
up
to

and
down
to
los

and
on
to
new
orleans
and
the
other
a
branch
line
to
stockton
sacramento
etc
merced
is
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
it
is
a
pleasant
little
town
affords
some
congenial
society
and
i
firmly
believe
will
before
many
years
have
passed
become
an
important
centre
because
my
clients
have
brought
water
from
the
merced
river
more
than
twenty
miles
off
by
a
system
of
canals
and
have
formed
a
reservoir
of
acres
in
extent
with
an
average
depth
of
feet
and
thus
have
given
facilities
for
irrigating
the
country
round
the
town
it
is
certain
to
become
a
great
district
as
its
soil
is
so
fully
adapted
for
the
purpose
it
is
much
nearer
to
san
francisco
than
los
angeles
and
is
nearer
also
than
fresno
and
other
districts
which
have
already
made
themselves
a
name
for
fruit
culture
the
country
around
merced
has
a
natural
fall
and
is
drained
by
many
creeks
which
are
dry
in
summer
but
contain
more
or
less
water
in
winter
the
lands
for
sale
merced
is
situated
in
the
celebrated
san
joaquin
valley
pronounced
san
wharkeen
which
is
an
immense
level
of
fertile
land
the
soil
generally
being
of
a
rich
sandy
loam
but
in
some
districts
such
as
that
i
am
now
offering
for
sale
of
a
deep
rich
black
loam
of
a
highly
productive
nature
in
fact
it
is
the
decomposed
vegetation
and
alluvial
deposits
of
past
ages
than
which
nothing
could
be
more
fertile
we
have
good
evidence
that
the
land
is
especially
suited
for
the
production
of
prunes
apricots
pears
peaches
olives
plums
small
fruit
such
as
strawberries
blackberries
sweet
and
common
potatoes
garden
stuff
and
alfalfa
alfalfa
or
lucerne
is
a
great
crop
in
america
in
places
where
there
are
no
old
meadow
lands
for
the
cows
the
land
is
of
course
suited
for
all
cereal
crops
too
all
the
fruits
named
can
be
dried
in
the
sun
without
artificial
heat
the
lands
are
about
to
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
in
common
with
all
the
country
round
they
command
a
view
on
the
one
side
of
the
grand
sierra
nevada
mountains
and
on
the
other
of
the
mountains
known
as
the
coast
range
immense
flocks
of
wild
geese
and
ducks
principally
geese
are
often
on
the
land
there
are
also
rabbits
on
the
land
so
called
but
they
more
resemble
hares
in
their
size
and
habits
and
run
there
are
some
excellent
fruit
orchards
and
gardens
at
merced
in
the
grounds
around
the
court
house
are
some
very
fine
orange
trees
full
of
fruit
and
also
in
the
gardens
of
private
residents
one
gentleman
kindly
sent
a
bough
of
oranges
and
other
gentlemen
sent
other
fruits
which
may
be
seen
at
our
offices
at
the
buhach
colony
near
the
town
of
merced
are
extensive
orchards
of
californian
fruits
gardens
and
orchard
a
few
miles
from
the
town
are
worth
inspection
he
has
two
magnificent
olive
trees
nine
or
ten
years
old
which
bear
heavy
crops
and
which
are
used
for
the
production
of
olive
oil
his
vineyard
and
orange
orchard
his
lemon
and
persimmon
trees
all
look
very
prosperous
he
would
gladly
show
any
settler
how
he
has
cultivated
them
he
has
a
corn
and
stock
farm
and
has
only
gradually
cultivated
these
fruits
which
occupy
some
eleven
acres
price
of
the
land
the
prices
of
the
land
for
sale
are
and
and
dollars
per
acre
according
to
position
of
the
may
remain
on
mortgage
as
long
as
the
interest
is
paid
at
per
cent
per
annum
which
is
the
lowest
interest
payable
in
california
the
mortgagor
is
liable
to
the
government
for
the
taxes
which
amount
to
to
per
cent
per
annum
so
that
he
would
really
only
receive
to
per
cent
interest
all
mortgages
are
publicly
recorded
and
so
the
property
is
vested
in
the
mortgagor
till
he
is
paid
off
and
when
that
is
done
it
also
is
publicly
recorded
these
taxes
embrace
all
known
to
us
in
england
as
rates
and
taxes
except
a
road
tax
of
dollars
a
head
per
annum
chargeable
to
every
male
over
years
of
age
this
tax
may
be
paid
for
in
labour
on
the
road
if
desired
a
free
conveyance
will
be
given
but
the
cost
of
recording
the
transaction
in
the
county
office
there
is
no
stamp
duty
about
dollars
must
be
paid
by
the
purchaser
the
recording
of
a
mortgage
would
probably
be
dollars
because
it
is
longer
the
record
is
a
public
acknowledgment
of
the
title
of
the
owner
to
the
land
made
in
the
county
books
foreigners
can
hold
freehold
property
in
california
but
they
have
no
right
to
vote
indeed
they
would
have
no
right
to
vote
until
they
had
resided
five
years
in
the
country
and
had
become
naturalized
then
a
resident
has
before
him
the
possibility
of
becoming
governor
of
the
state
to
which
he
belongs
or
indeed
secretary
of
the
interior
which
corresponds
with
the
position
of
the
premier
in
england
american
surveys
according
to
the
american
surveys
the
country
is
arranged
in
squares
as
shown
on
all
the
maps
a
section
is
a
square
mile
or
acres
a
township
is
sections
six
miles
on
each
of
its
four
sides
a
quarter
section
is
acres
and
the
lands
are
so
arranged
that
a
roadway
is
reserved
around
each
quarter
section
feet
wide
and
the
land
for
such
roadway
is
taken
from
each
side
so
that
each
owner
has
to
contribute
feet
to
such
road
and
of
course
he
has
the
benefit
of
the
frontage
to
it
a
acre
lot
would
be
an
eighth
of
a
quarter
section
on
some
of
the
lots
for
sale
at
british
colony
are
one

two

some
buildings
these
may
be
purchased
thus
one
house
and
buildings
dollars
another

another

but
if
one
purchaser
bought
four
lots
of
acres
each
adjoining
so
that
one

should
come
near

then

in

knowledge
of

culture
few
settlers
would
have
the
requisite
special
knowledge
of
fruit
culture
without
some
instruction
and
therefore
the
owners
of
the
land
have
engaged
the
services
of
professor
eisen
at
a
fixed
salary
so
that
all
settlers
on
their

may
have
the

of
the

in

he
has
just
published
a

which
may
be

at

the

while
on

an
enormous
trade
is
done
in
america
in
canned
fruits
the
hotels
steamers
railway
cars
and
private
families
use
them
largely
at
all

america
itself
seems
to
be
a
sufficient
market
for

to
come

the
estimates
were
furnished
us
by
professor
eisen
who
remarked
that
probably
in
giving
estimates
all
persons
would
vary
somewhat
but
these
and
other
estimates
which
he
gave
are
really
more
than
estimates
because
they
are
the
actual
results
of
past
experiences
professor
eisen
opinion
received
january
professor
eisen
writes
i
am
of
opinion
that
these
lands
british
colony
merced
are
amongst
the
very
best
in
the
state
for
raisins
still
as
i
explained
to
you
i
do
not
advise
any
one
to
put
his
whole
interest
in
the
raisin
industry
as
the
market
for
this
fruit
is
limited
for
other
dried
fruit
especially
for
prunes
french
plums
apricots
peaches
and
nectarines
the
market
is
practically
unlimited
and
as
our
population
increases
yearly
people
it
will
be
seen
that
our
markets
must
extend
as
well
even
after
we
have
driven
all
foreign
fruits
out
of
our
home
markets
as
regards
the
adaptability
of
the
land
of
british
colony
for
various
fruits
i
can
say
that
they
are
especially
adapted
to
the
prune
french
plums
and
peaches
for
drying
and
canning
olives
for
olive
oil
and
pickling
also
for
oranges
you
can
see
how
the
orange
thrives
in
the
city
of
merced
and
surroundings
or
in
localities
exactly
like
those
of
british
colony
lands
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
oranges
and
lemons
will
prove
very
profitable
in
british
colony
olives
will
especially
do
well
there
the
british
colony
lands
i
consider
as
exceptionally
rich
and
fertile
and
there
are
few
if
any
equal
to
them
in
this
state

anywhere
else

only

would
they

considerable
amount
the
fifth

they
would
come
into

and
should
then
yield
a

of
say
from

at
seven

the

possibly

position
of
a

the
position
of
a
settler
then
is
that
for
the
first
three
years
he
can
not
depend
upon
his
crop
of
fruit
to
maintain
him
but
must
either
have
sufficient
capital
to
support
him
during
that
time
or
else
earn
his
living
in
some
other
way
to
be
idle
and
live
on
capital
would
not
of
course
suit
any
man
who
meant
to
succeed
and
therefore
he
would
fill
up
his
time
in
cultivating
garden
and
poultry
produce
for
which
there
is
always
a
demand
or
in
getting
some
occasional
employment
cost
of
board
and
lodging
at
merced
railway
station
is
a
very
large
hotel
and
the
cost
of

raisin
culture
the
rural
referring
to
the
raisin
vineyards
in
the
san
joaquin
valley
california
states
what
is
especially
interesting
to
the
in
connection
with
this
information
is
the
fact
that
everyone
of
these
vineyardists
is
prosperous
no
other
horticultural
industry
is
so
profitable
as
the
culture
of
the
raisin
grape
in
no
other
is
the
work
so
pleasant
and
no
other
yields
a
return
so
quickly
an
acre
of
muscat
vines
in
full
bearing
will
yield
from
two
to
three
tons
of
grapes
on
good
heavy
soil
at
cents
a
pound
in
the
this
means
from
to
dollars
per
acre
gross
numerous
instances
are
known
however
where
the
yield
of
an
acre
of
muscats
amounted
to
as
much
as
dollars
this
being
the
result
of
careful
cultivation
and
favourable
circumstances
some
grapes
are
borne
on
the
vines
when
they
are
old
while
old
have
been
known
to
bear
a
crop
at
three
years
the
vines
pay
the
expenses
and
interest
on
the
money
invested
and
at
four
years
from
planting
they
bring
the
first
large
paying
crop
the
says
of
raisin
culture
one
of
the
great
charms
of
raisin
culture
is
the
extreme
simplicity
of
its
operations
what
can
be
more
simple
than
to
pick
a
bunch
of
muscat
grapes
from
the
vine
and
lay
it
on
the
ground
in
six
days
the
bunch
of
grapes
without
being
meanwhile
touched
has
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
bunch
of
raisins
and
has
flattened
out
as
if
it
had
been
pressed
it
is
then
carefully
turned
over
so
as
to
expose
the
underside
to
the
direct
action
of
the
sun
in
eight
days
more
it
is
a
perfect
bunch
of
raisins
and
no
act
of
man
can
improve
it
even
in
appearance
all
the
operations
of
fancy
packing
are
so
simple
that
a
child
may
learn
them
in
a
day
a
single
acre
of
raisin
vines
in
a
merced
colony

children

in
the
near
future

contains
an
article
on
california
which
all
persons
interested
in
that
state
would
do
well
to
read
i
extract
a
few
statements
irrigation
a
piece
of
land
at
riverside
below
the
flow
of
water
was
worth
dollars
an
acre
contiguous
to
it
was
another
piece
not
irrigated
which
would
not
sell
for
dollars
an
acre
by
bringing
water
to
it
it
would
quickly
sell
for
dollars
thus
adding
dollars
to
its
value
as
the
estimate
at
river
side
is
that
one
inch
of
water
will
irrigate
five
acres
of
fruit
land
five
times
dollars
would
be
dollars
per
inch
at
which
price
water
for
irrigation
has
actually
been
sold
at
riverside
the
standard
of
measurement
of
water
in
southern
california
is
the
miner
inch
under
four
inches
pressure
or
the
amount
that
will
flow
through
an
opening
under
a
pressure
of
four
inches
measured
from
the
surface
of
the
water
in
the
conduit
to
the
centre
of
the
opening
through
which
it
flows
this
is
nine
gallons
a
minute
or
as
it
is
figured
cubic
feet
or
gallons
in
hours
and
of
a
cubic
foot
a
second
this
flow
would
cover
acres
about
inches
deep
in
a
year
that
is
it
would
give
the
land
the
equivalent
of
inches
of
rain
distributed
exactly
when
and
where
it
was
needed
none
being
wasted
and
more
serviceable
than
inches
of
rainfall
as
it
generally
comes
this
with
the
natural
rainfall
is
sufficient
for
citrous
fruits
and
for
corn
and
alfalfa
in
soil
not
too
sandy
and
it
is
too
much
for
grapes
and
all
deciduous
fruits
but
irrigation
in
order
to
be
successful
must
be
intelligently
applied
in
unskilful
hands
it
may
work
more
damage
than
benefit
theodore
van
dyke
who
may
always
be
quoted
with
confidence
says
that
the
ground
should
never
he
flooded
that
water
must
not
touch
the
plant
or
tree
or
come
near
enough
to
make
the
soil
bake
around
it
and
that
it
should
be
let
in
in
small
streams
for
two
or
three
days
and
not
in
large
streams
for
a
few
hours
olive
culture
the
growth
of
the
olive
is
to
be
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
leading
and
most
permanent
industries
of
southern
california
it
will
give
us
what
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
buy
now
pure
olive
oil
in
place
of
the
cotton
seed
and
lard
mixture
in
general
use
it
is
a
most
wholesome
and
palatable
article
of
food
those
whose
chief
experience
of
the
olive
is
the
large
coarse
and
not
agreeable
spanish
variety
used
only
as
an
appetizer
know
little
of
the
value
of
the
best
varieties
as
food
nutritious
as
meat
and
always
delicious
good
bread
and
a
dish
of
pickled
olives
make
an
excellent
meal
a
mature
olive
grove
in
good
bearing
is
a
fortune
i
feel
sure
that
within
years
this
will
be
one
of
the
most
profitable
industries
of
california
and
that
the
demand
for
pure
oil
and
edible
fruit
in
the
united
states
will
drive
out
the
adulterated
and
inferior
present
commercial
products
special
openings
there
are
now
at
merced
special
openings
for
a
nurseryman
and
a
dairyman
the
latter
would
be
by
growing
alfalfa
lucerne
and
raising
poultry
for
at
present
the
merced
people
often
have
to
get
poultry
and
eggs
from
san
francisco
miles
off
potato
growing
a
settler
might
make
a
really
good
return
out
of
potatoes
while
his
fruit
trees
are
maturing
which
is
a
food
more
in
use
in
america
than
in
england
potatoes
are
not
only
served
at
luncheon
and
dinner
but
also
at
breakfast
everywhere
and
if
every
settler
planted
his
land
with
potatoes
there
would
be
no
fear
of
overstocking
the
market
eisen
states
that
potatoes
yield
from
to
sacks
to
the
acre
and
sell
at
prices
varying
from
cents
to
dollars
per
sack
if
only
sacks
were
grown
to
the
acre
it
would
show
a
scarce
year
when
prices
would
range
higher
but
the
crop
is
never
a
failure
in
california
two
crops
can
be
grown
in
a
year
the
first
crop
is
planted
at
the
end
of
february
if
warm
or
else
in
march
or
indeed
any
time
till
the
middle
of
may
and
dug
three
months
after
the
second
crop
is
planted
in
august
or
september
and
dug
three
months
after
to
put
in
the
potatoes
a
settler
would
need
the
help
of
a
labourer
to
whom
he
would
have
to
give
one
dollar
per
day
and
his
board
or
if
the
labourer
be
a
chinaman
one
dollar
and
a
quarter
per
day
without
his
board
if
the
potatoes
occupied
ten
acres
and
they
produced
say
sacks
to
the
acre
and
fetched
dollar
per
sack
that
would
yield
dollars
or
for
the
two
crops
dollars
or
say
this
sounds
a
large
sum
but
the
land
is
exceedingly
rich
as
may
be
seen
from
the
samples
i
have
brought
back
and
large
results
may
be
expected
from
it
if
properly
worked
for
of
course
in
any
undertaking
the
result
depends
upon
the
way
it
is
worked
the
following
paragraph
is
from
an
important
paper
or
periodical
of
pages
known
as
the
rural
of
december
and
although
the
crop
it
mentions
was
not
grown
in
california
it
shows
at
least
what
can
be
done
on
good
ground
nearly
bushels
of
potatoes
or
to
be
exact
bushels
and
pounds
have
been
grown
on
one
acre
of
land
in
johnson
county
wyoming
the
past
season
this
crop
wins
the
first
prize
of
several
hundred
dollars
offered
by
the
for
the
largest
yield
of
potatoes
on
one
exact
acre
it
was
grown
on
virgin
soil
without
manure
or
fertilizer
but
the
land
was
rich
in
potash
and
the
copious
irrigation
was
of
water
also
rich
in
saline
material
there
were
hills
on
one
acre
and
pounds
of
sets
containing
one
two
and
three
eyes
were
planted
of
the
early
vermont
and
manhattan
varieties
the
profit
on
the
crop
on
this
first
prize
acre
was
dollars
exclusive
of
dollars
in
prizes
thus
this
one
acre
would
have
produced
worth
of
potatoes
i
do
not
mention
it
as
an
example
of
what
a
settler
may
or
may
not
do
at
merced
but
as
the
land
at
merced
which
i
am
offering
for
sale
is
of
the
richest
quality
rich
results
may
certainly
be
expected

analysis
of

having
fitted
up
a
portion
of
one
of
my
offices
with
all
the
requisites
for
carrying
out
quantitative
analyses
of
surface
soils
i
requested
professor
lobley
to
analyse
the
four
samples
of
soils
which
i
brought
with
me
from
merced
a
general
analysis
of
four
samples
of
soil
from
merced
california
has
given
the
following
results
sample
organic

humus
soluble
inorganic

insoluble
silica
and

sample
organic

humus
soluble
inorganic
matter
insoluble
silica
and
silicates
the
organic
matter
is
available
for
plant
growth
the
inorganic
matter
soluble
in
dilute
hydrochloric
acid
is
with
the
exception
of
the
alumina
it
may
contain
composed
of
fertilising
material
the
substances
found
in
the
soluble
inorganic
matter
of
soils
are
lime
magnesia
alumina
silica
phosphoric
acid
oxide
of
iron
oxide
of
manganese
potash
and
soda
the
insoluble
mineral
matter
is
nearly
all
silica
there
is
very
little
clayey
matter
in
any
of
the
soils
not
more
than
about
five
per
cent
all
the
soils
are
remarkably
free
from
stones
or
pebbles
or
even
coarse
sand
from
the
above
it
will
be
seen
that
these
soils
while
possessing
a
large
amount
of
matter
available
for
plant
growth
are
exceedingly
friable
and
would
be
very
easily
worked
they
would
absorb
heat
quickly
and
from
their
porosity
would
require
little
drainage
and
so
would
be
both
warm
and
dry
soils
and
form
fertile
land
suitable
for
almost
all
kinds
of
agricultural
and
horticultural
produce
the
position
of
my
clients
the
vendors
my
clients
the
owners
of
the
land
called
british
colony
at
merced
are
persons
as
men
of
great
wealth
and
as
gentlemen
of
undoubted
integrity
the
hon
charles
crocker
and
huffman
whose
enterprises
in
railway
canal
and
other
public
works
have
been
of
gigantic
proportions
i
have
every
confidence
myself
in
dealing
with
these
gentlemen
and
i
submit
that
my
friends
clients
and
the
general
public
who
may
be
willing
to
take
up
any
of
this
british
colony
land
at
merced
may
have
full
confidence
too
that
they
will
at
least
be
treated
justly
and
more
than
that
is
not
expected
from
strangers
in
business
but
i
believe
that
i
might
add
they
would
be
treated
liberally
if
necessity
arose
and
i
have
ground
for
this
statement
from
what
i
have
heard
of
their
treatment
of
other
persons
who
have
settled
in
one
of
their
other
colonies
california
merced
i
have
for
sale
besides
the
estate
designated
british
colony
a
tract
of
land
belonging
to
a
merchant
in
the
city
of
london
who
has
owned
it
for
years
it
comprises
acres
and
has
a
registered
government
title
price
dollars
per
acre
and
credit
would
be
given
if
per
cent
is
paid
down
part
of
it
is
well
suited
for
fruit
growing
but
as
yet
the
water
from
the
canals
belonging
to
my
other
clients
has
not
been
taken
to
it
it
has
however
some
creeks
upon
it
but
they
are
frequently
dry
the
land
is
of
a
rolling
prairie
character
and
is
now
let
at
a
nominal
rent
of
cents
per
acre
for
sheep
farming
the
soil
is
varied
some
of
it
is
a
good
loam
some
of
a
clayey
nature
and
some
stony
there
is
a
shepherd
house
with
barn
and
yard
the
taxes
upon
it
are
about
to
cents
per
acre
one
half
of
the
land
would
be
sold
separately
but
it
must
be
the
half
farthest
from
the
side
where
the
canals
are
the
situation
is
an
attractive
one
as
the
undulations
really
form
the
first
foothills
of
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
of
which
there
is
a
grand
view
this
land
is
well
worth
buying
as
when
water
is
obtained
the
price
will
then
be
increased
to
that
asked
for
other
irrigated
fruit
lands
