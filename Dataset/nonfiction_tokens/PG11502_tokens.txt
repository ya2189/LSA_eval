i
go
in
from

on

to
deal
with

there
is
the

in

and

call

then
in
elfin
tones
the
real
message
comes
through
blériot
has
crossed
the
channel
an
article
about
what
it
means
i
make
a
hasty
promise
and
go
out
and
tell
my
friends
from
my
garden
i
look
straight
upon
the
channel
and
there
are
white
caps
upon
the
water
and
the
iris
and
tamarisk
are
all
asway
with
the
wind
that
was
also
blowing
yesterday
blériot
has
done
very
well
and
latham
his
rival
had
jolly
bad
luck
that
is
what
it
means
to
us
first
of
all
it
also
i
reflect
privately
means
that
i
have
the
possible
stability
of
aeroplanes
i
did
not
expect
anything
of
the
sort
so
soon
this
is
a
good
five
years
before
my
reckoning
of
the
year
before
last
we
all
i
think
regret
that
being
so
near
we
were
not
among
the
fortunate
ones
who
saw
that
little
flat
shape
skim
landward
out
of
the
blue
surely
they
have
an
enviable
memory
and
then
we
fell
talking
and
disputing
about
what
that
swift
arrival
may
signify
it
starts
a
swarm
of
questions
first
one
remarks
that
here
is
a
thing
done
and
done
with
an
astonishing
effect
of
ease
that
was
incredible
not
simply
to
ignorant
people
but
to
men
well
informed
in
these
matters
it
can
not
be
fifteen
years
ago
since
sir
hiram
maxim
made
the
first
machine
that
could
lift
its
weight
from
the
ground
and
i
well
remember
how
the
clumsy
quality
of
that
success
confirmed
the
universal
doubt
that
men
could
ever
in
any
effectual
manner
fly
since
then
a
conspiracy
of
accidents
has
changed
the
whole
problem
the
bicycle
and
its
vibrations
developed
the
pneumatic
tyre
the
pneumatic
tyre
rendered
a
comfortable
mechanically
driven
road
vehicle
possible
the
set
an
enormous
premium
on
the
development
of
very
light
very
efficient
engines
and
at
last
the
engineer
was
able
to
offer
the
experimentalists
in
gliding
one
strong
enough
and
light
enough
for
the
new
purpose
and
here
we
are
or
rather
blériot
is
what
does
it
mean
for
us
one
meaning
i
think
stands
out
plainly
enough
unpalatable
enough
to
our
national
pride
this
thing
from
first
to
last
was
made
abroad
of
all
that
made
it
possible
we
can
only
claim
so
much
as
is
due
to
the
improvement
of
the
bicycle
gliding
began
abroad
while
our
young
men
of
muscle
and
courage
were
braving
the
dangers
of
the
cricket
field
the
and
its
engine
was
being
worked
out
over
there
while
in
this
country
the
mechanically
propelled
road
vehicle
lest
it
should
frighten
the
carriage
horses
of
the
gentry
was
going
meticulously
at
four
miles
an
hour
behind
a
man
with
a
red
flag
over
there
where
the
prosperous
classes
have
some
regard
for
education
and
some
freedom
of
imaginative
play
where
people
discuss
all
sorts
of
things
fearlessly
and
have
a
respect
for
science
this
has
been
achieved
and
now
our
insularity
is
breached
by
the
foreigner
who
has
got
ahead
with
flying
it
means
i
take
it
first
and
foremost
for
us
that
the
world
can
not
wait
for
the
english
it
is
not
the
first
warning
we
have
had
it
has
been
raining
warnings
upon
us
never
was
a
slacking
dull
people
so
liberally
served
with
warnings
of
what
was
in
store
for
them
but
this
event
this
thing
taking
our
silver
streak
as
a
bird
soars
across
a
rivulet
puts
the
case
dramatically
we
have
fallen
behind
in
the
quality
of
our
manhood
in
the
men
of
means
and
leisure
in
this
island
there
was
neither
enterprise
enough
imagination
enough
knowledge
nor
skill
enough
to
lead
in
this
matter
i
do
not
see
how
one
can
go
into
the
history
of
this
development
and
arrive
at
any
other
conclusion
the
french
and
americans
can
laugh
at
our
aeroplanes
the
germans
are
ten
years
ahead
of
our
poor
navigables
we
are
displayed
a
soft
rather
backward
people
either
we
are
a
people
essentially
and
incurably
inferior
or
there
is
something
wrong
in
our
training
something
benumbing
in
our
atmosphere
and
circumstances
that
is
the
first
and
gravest
intimation
in
feat
the
second
is
that
in
spite
of
our
fleet
this
is
no
longer
from
the
military
point
of
view
an
inaccessible
island
so
long
as
one
had
to
consider
the
navigable
balloon
the
aerial
side
of
warfare
remained
unimportant
a
zeppelin
is
little
good
for
any
purpose
but
scouting
and
espionage
it
can
carry
very
little
weight
in
proportion
to
its
vast
size
and
what
is
more
important
it
can
not
drop
things
without
sending
itself
up
like
a
bubble
in
soda
water
an
armada
of
navigables
sent
against
this
island
would
end
in
a
dispersed
deflated
state
chiefly
in
the
seas
between
orkney
and
norway
though
i
say
it
who
should
not
but
these
aeroplanes
can
fly
all
round
the
fastest
navigable
that
ever
drove
before
the
wind
they
can
drop
weights
take
up
weights
and
do
all
sorts
of
able
inconvenient
things
they
are
birds
as
for
the
birds
so
for
aeroplanes
there
is
an
upward
limit
of
size
they
are
not
going
to
be
very
big
but
they
are
going
to
be
very
able
and
active
within
a
year
we
shall
have
or
rather
will
have
aeroplanes
capable
of
starting
from
calais
let
us
say
circling
over
london
dropping
a
hundredweight
or
so
of
explosive
upon
the
printing
machines
of
and
returning
securely
to
calais
for
another
similar
parcel
they
are
things
neither
difficult
nor
costly
to
make
for
the
price
of
a
dreadnought
one
might
have
hundreds
they
will
be
extremely
hard
to
hit
with
any
sort
of
missile
i
do
not
think
a
large
army
of
extremely
unwilling
conscripts
is
going
to
be
any
good
against
this
sort
of
thing
i
do
not
think
that
the
arrival
of
blériot
means
a
panic
resort
to
conscription
it
is
extremely
desirable
that
people
should
realise
that
these
foreign
machines
are
not
a
temporary
and
incidental
advantage
that
we
can
make
good
by
fussing
and
demanding
eight
and
saying
we
wait
and
so
on
and
then
subsiding
into
indolence
again
they
are
just
the
of
a
steady
enduring
lead
that
the
foreigner
has
won
the
foreigner
is
ahead
of
us
in
education
and
this
is
especially
true
of
the
middle
and
upper
classes
from
which
invention
and
enterprise
come
or
in
our
own
case
do
not
come
he
makes
a
better
class
of
man
than
we
do
his
science
is
better
than
ours
his
training
is
better
than
ours
his
imagination
is
livelier
his
mind
is
more
active
his
requirements
in
a
novel
for
example
are
not
kindly
sedative
pap
his
uncensored
plays
deal
with
reality
his
schools
are
places
for
vigorous
education
instead
of
genteel
athleticism
and
his
home
has
books
in
it
and
thought
and
conversation
our
homes
and
schools
are
relatively
dull
and
uninspiring
there
is
no
intellectual
guide
or
stir
in
them
and
to
that
we
owe
this
new
generation
of
nicely
behaved
unenterprising
sons
who
play
golf
and
dominate
the
tailoring
of
the
world
while
brazilians
frenchmen
americans
and
germans
fly
that
we
are
hopelessly
behindhand
in
aeronautics
is
not
a
fact
by
itself
it
is
merely
an
indication
that
we
are
behindhand
in
our
mechanical
knowledge
and
invention
blériot
aeroplane
points
also
to
the
fleet
the
struggle
for
naval
supremacy
is
not
merely
a
struggle
in
shipbuilding
and
expenditure
much
more
is
it
a
struggle
in
knowledge
and
invention
it
is
not
the
power
that
has
the
most
ships
or
the
biggest
ships
that
is
going
to
win
in
a
naval
conflict
it
is
the
power
that
thinks
quickest
of
what
to
do
is
most
resourceful
and
inventive
eighty
dreadnoughts
manned
by
dull
men
are
only
eighty
targets
for
a
quicker
adversary
well
is
there
any
reason
to
suppose
that
our
navy
is
going
to
keep
above
the
general
national
level
in
these
things
is
the
navy
the
arrival
of
blériot
suggests
most
horribly
to
me
how
far
behind
we
must
be
in
all
matters
of
ingenuity
device
and
mechanical
contrivance
i
am
reminded
again
of
the
days
during
the
boer
war
when
one
realised
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
our
army
that
it
was
possible
to
make
a
military
use
of
barbed
wire
or
construct
a
trench
to
defy
shrapnel
suppose
in
the
north
sea
we
got
a
surprise
like
that
and
fished
out
a
parboiled
admiral
explaining
what
a
confoundedly
slim
unexpected
almost
ungentlemanly
thing
the
enemy
had
done
to
him
very
probably
the
navy
is
the
exception
to
the
british
system
its
officers
are
rescued
from
the
dull
homes
and
dull
schools
of
their
class
while
still
of
tender
years
and
shaped
after
a
fashion
of
their
own
but
blériot
reminds
us
that
we
may
no
longer
shelter
and
degenerate
behind
these
blue
backs
and
the
keenest
men
at
sea
are
none
the
worse
for
having
keen
men
on
land
behind
them
are
we
an
awakening
people
it
is
the
vital
riddle
of
our
time
i
look
out
upon
the
windy
channel
and
think
of
all
those
millions
just
over
there
who
seem
to
get
busier
and
keener
every
hour
i
could
imagine
the
day
of
reckoning
coming
like
a
swarm
of
birds
here
the
air
is
full
of
the
clamour
of
rich
and
prosperous
people
invited
to
pay
taxes
and
beyond
measure
bitter
they
are
going
to
live
abroad
cut
their
charities
dismiss
old
servants
and
do
all
sorts
of
silly
vindictive
things
we
seem
to
be
doing
feeble
in
the
endowment
of
research
not
one
in
twenty
of
the
boys
of
the
middle
and
upper
classes
learns
german
or
gets
more
than
a
misleading
smattering
of
physical
science
most
of
them
never
learn
to
speak
french
heaven
alone
knows
what
they
do
with
their
brains
the
british
reading
and
thinking
public
probably
does
not
number
fifty
thousand
people
all
told
it
is
difficult
to
see
whence
the
necessary
impetus
for
a
national
renascence
is
to
come
the
universities
are
poor
and
spiritless
with
no
ambition
to
lead
the
country
i
met
a
boy
scout
recently
he
was
hopeful
in
his
way
but
a
little
inadequate
i
thought
as
a
basis
for
confidence
in
the
future
of
the
empire
we
have
still
our
derby
day
of
course
apart
from
these
patriotic
solicitudes
blériot
has
set
quite
another
train
of
thought
going
in
my
mind
the
age
of
natural
democracy
is
surely
at
an
end
through
these
machines
there
comes
a
time
when
men
will
be
sorted
out
into
those
who
will
have
the
knowledge
nerve
and
courage
to
do
these
splendid
dangerous
things
and
those
who
will
prefer
the
humbler
level
i
do
not
think
numbers
are
going
to
matter
so
much
in
the
warfare
of
the
future
and
that
when
organised
intelligence
differs
from
the
majority
the
majority
will
have
no
adequate
power
of
retort
the
common
man
with
a
pike
being
only
sufficiently
indignant
and
abundant
could
chase
the
eighteenth
century
gentleman
as
he
chose
but
i
fail
to
see
what
he
can
do
in
the
way
of
mischief
to
an
elusive
chevalier
with
wings
but
that
opens
too
wide
a
discussion
for
me
to
enter
upon
now
my
first
flight
eastbourne
three
years
hitherto
my
only
flights
have
been
flights
of
imagination
but
this
morning
i
flew
i
spent
about
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
in
the
air
we
went
out
to
sea
soared
up
came
back
over
the
land
circled
higher
planed
steeply
down
to
the
water
and
i
landed
with
the
conviction
that
i
had
had
only
the
foretaste
of
a
great
store
of
hitherto
unsuspected
pleasures
at
the
first
chance
i
will
go
up
again
and
i
will
go
higher
and
further
this
experience
has
restored
all
the
keenness
of
my
ancient
interest
in
flying
which
had
become
a
little
fagged
and
flat
by
too
much
hearing
and
reading
about
the
thing
and
not
enough
participation
sixteen
years
ago
in
the
days
of
langley
and
lilienthal
i
was
one
of
the
few
journalists
who
believed
and
wrote
that
flying
was
possible
it
affected
my
reputation
unfavourably
and
produced
in
the
few
discouraged
pioneers
of
those
days
a
quite
touching
gratitude
over
my
mantel
as
i
write
hangs
a
very
blurred
and
bad
but
interesting
photograph
that
professor
langley
sent
me
sixteen
years
ago
it
shows
the
flight
of
the
first
piece
of
human
machinery
heavier
than
air
that
ever
kept
itself
up
for
any
length
of
time
it
was
a
model
a
little
affair
that
would
not
have
lifted
a
cat
it
went
up
in
a
spiral
and
came
down
unsmashed
bringing
back
like
noah
dove
the
promise
of
tremendous
things
that
was
only
sixteen
years
ago
and
it
is
amusing
to
recall
how
cautiously
even
we
believers
did
our
prophesying
i
was
quite
a
desperate
fellow
i
said
outright
that
in
my
lifetime
we
should
see
men
flying
but
i
qualified
that
by
repeating
that
for
many
years
to
come
it
would
be
an
enterprise
only
for
quite
fantastic
daring
and
skill
we
conjured
up
stupendous
difficulties
and
risks
i
was
deeply
impressed
and
greatly
discouraged
by
a
paper
a
distinguished
cambridge
mathematician
produced
to
show
that
a
flying
machine
was
bound
to
pitch
fearfully
that
as
it
flew
on
its
pitching
increase
until
up
went
its
nose
down
went
its
tail
and
it
fell
like
a
knife
we
exaggerated
every
possibility
of
instability
we
imagined
that
when
the
aeroplane
was
kicking
up
ahind
and
afore
it
would
be
heeling
over
to
the
lightest
side
wind
a
sneeze
might
upset
it
we
contrasted
our
poor
human
equipment
with
the
instinctive
balance
of
a
bird
which
has
had
ten
million
years
of
evolution
by
way
of
a
start
the
waterplane
in
which
i
soared
over
eastbourne
this
morning
with
was
as
steady
as
a
running
on
asphalt
then
we
went
on
from
those
anticipations
of
swaying
insecurity
to
speculations
about
the
psychological
and
physiological
effects
of
flying
most
people
who
look
down
from
the
top
of
a
cliff
or
high
tower
feel
some
slight
qualms
of
dread
many
feel
a
quite
sickening
dread
even
if
men
struggled
high
into
the
air
we
asked
would
they
be
smitten
up
there
by
such
a
lonely
and
reeling
dismay
as
to
lose
all
and
above
all
would
the
pitching
and
tossing
make
them
quite
horribly
i
have
always
been
a
little
haunted
by
that
last
dread
it
gave
a
little
undertow
of
funk
to
the
mood
of
lively
curiosity
with
which
i
got
aboard
the
waterplane
this
morning
that
sort
of
faint
thin
funk
that
so
readily
invades
one
on
the
verge
of
any
new
experience
when
one
tries
one
first
dive
for
example
or
pushes
off
for
the
first
time
down
an
ice
run
i
thought
i
should
very
probably
be
or
to
be
more
precise
i
thought
also
that
i
might
be
very
giddy
and
that
i
might
get
thoroughly
cold
and
uncomfortable
none
of
those
things
happened
i
am
still
in
a
state
of
amazement
at
the
smooth
steadfastness
of
the
motion
there
is
nothing
on
earth
to
compare
with
that
unless
and
that
i
ca
judge
it
is
an
ice
yacht
travelling
on
perfect
ice
the
finest
in
the
world
on
the
best
road
would
be
a
joggling
quivering
thing
beside
it
to
begin
with
we
went
out
to
sea
before
the
wind
and
the
plane
would
not
readily
rise
we
went
with
an
undulating
movement
leaping
with
a
light
splashing
pat
upon
the
water
from
wave
to
wave
then
we
came
about
into
the
wind
and
rose
and
looking
over
i
saw
that
there
were
no
longer
those
periodic
flashes
of
white
foam
i
was
flying
and
it
was
as
still
and
steady
as
dreaming
i
watched
the
widening
distance
between
our
floats
and
the
waves
it
was
by
any
means
a
windless
day
there
was
a
brisk
fluctuating
breeze
blowing
out
of
the
north
over
the
downs
it
seemed
hardly
to
affect
our
flight
at
all
and
as
for
the
giddiness
of
looking
down
one
does
not
feel
it
at
all
it
is
difficult
to
explain
why
this
should
be
so
but
it
is
so
i
suppose
in
such
matters
i
am
neither
exceptionally
nor
is
my
head
exceptionally
given
to
swimming
i
can
stand
on
the
edge
of
cliffs
of
a
thousand
feet
or
so
and
look
down
but
i
can
never
bring
myself
right
up
to
the
edge
nor
crane
over
to
look
to
the
very
bottom
i
should
want
to
lie
down
to
do
that
and
the
other
day
i
was
on
that
belvedere
place
at
the
top
of
the
rotterdam
a
rather
high
wind
was
blowing
and
one
looks
down
through
the
chinks
between
the
boards
one
stands
on
upon
the
heads
of
the
people
in
the
streets
below
i
did
like
it
but
this
morning
i
looked
directly
down
on
a
little
fleet
of
fishing
boats
over
which
we
passed
and
on
the
crowds
assembling
on
the
beach
and
on
the
bathers
who
stared
up
at
us
from
the
breaking
surf
with
an
entirely
agreeable
exaltation
and
eastbourne
in
the
early
morning
sunshine
had
all
the
brightly
detailed
littleness
of
a
town
viewed
from
high
up
on
the
side
of
a
great
mountain
when
told
me
we
were
going
to
plane
down
i
will
confess
i
tightened
my
hold
on
the
sides
of
the
car
and
prepared
for
something
like
the
sensation
of
a
switchback
railway
on
a
larger
scale
just
for
a
moment
there
was
that
familiar
feeling
of
something
pressing
one
heart
up
towards
one
shoulders
and
lower
jaw
up
into
its
socket
and
of
grinding
one
lower
teeth
against
the
upper
and
then
it
passed
the
nose
of
the
car
and
all
the
machine
was
slanting
downwards
we
were
gliding
quickly
down
and
yet
there
was
no
feeling
that
one
rushed
not
even
as
one
rushes
in
coasting
a
hill
on
a
bicycle
it
was
a
tithe
of
the
thrill
of
those
three
descents
one
gets
on
the
great
mountain
railway
in
the
white
city
there
one
gets
a
disagreeable
quiver
up
one
backbone
from
the
wheels
and
a
real
sense
of
falling
it
is
quite
peculiar
to
flying
that
one
is
incredulous
of
any
collision
some
time
ago
i
was
in
a
that
ran
over
and
killed
a
small
dog
and
this
wretched
little
incident
has
left
an
open
wound
upon
my
nerves
i
am
never
quite
happy
in
a
car
now
i
ca
help
keeping
an
apprehensive
eye
ahead
but
you
fly
with
an
exhilarating
assurance
that
you
can
not
possibly
run
over
anything
or
run
into
anything
except
the
land
or
the
sea
and
even
those
large
essentials
seem
a
beautifully
safe
distance
away
i
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
deafening
uproar
of
the
engine
i
counted
a
headache
among
my
chances
there
again
reason
reinforced
conjecture
when
in
the
early
morning
travers
came
from
brighton
in
this
farman
in
which
i
flew
i
could
hear
the
hum
of
the
great
insect
when
it
still
seemed
abreast
of
beachy
head
and
a
good
two
miles
away
if
one
can
hear
a
thing
at
two
miles
how
much
the
more
will
one
not
hear
it
at
a
distance
of
two
yards
but
at
the
risk
of
seeming
too
contented
for
anything
i
will
assert
i
heard
that
noise
no
more
than
one
hears
the
drone
of
an
electric
ventilator
upon
one
table
it
was
only
when
i
came
to
speak
to
or
he
to
me
that
i
discovered
that
our
voices
had
become
almost
infinitesimally
small
and
so
it
was
i
went
up
into
the
air
at
eastbourne
with
the
impression
that
flying
was
still
an
uncomfortable
experimental
and
slightly
heroic
thing
to
do
and
came
down
to
the
cheerful
gathering
crowd
upon
the
sands
again
with
the
knowledge
that
it
is
a
thing
achieved
for
everyone
it
will
get
much
cheaper
no
doubt
and
much
swifter
and
be
improved
in
a
dozen
ways
we
get
engines
for
example
for
both
our
aeroplanes
and
but
it
is
available
for
anyone
who
can
reach
it
an
invalid
lady
of
seventy
could
have
enjoyed
all
that
i
did
if
only
one
could
have
got
her
into
the
passenger
seat
getting
there
was
a
little
difficult
it
is
true
the
waterplane
was
out
in
the
surf
and
i
was
carried
to
it
on
a
boatman
back
and
then
had
to
clamber
carefully
through
the
wires
but
that
is
a
matter
of
detail
this
flying
is
indeed
so
certain
to
become
a
general
experience
that
i
am
sure
that
this
description
will
in
a
few
years
seem
almost
as
quaint
as
if
i
had
set
myself
to
record
the
fears
and
sensations
of
my
first
ride
in
a
wheeled
vehicle
and
i
suspect
that
learning
to
control
a
farman
waterplane
now
is
probably
not
much
more
difficult
than
let
us
say
twice
the
difficulty
in
learning
the
control
and
management
of
a
i
can
not
understand
the
sort
of
young
man
who
wo
learn
how
to
do
it
if
he
gets
half
a
chance
the
development
of
these
waterplanes
is
an
important
step
towards
the
huge
and
swarming
popularisation
of
flying
which
is
now
certainly
imminent
we
ancient
survivors
of
those
who
believed
in
and
wrote
about
flying
before
there
was
any
flying
used
to
make
a
great
fuss
about
the
dangers
and
difficulties
of
landing
and
getting
up
we
wrote
with
vast
gravity
about
starting
rails
and
landing
stages
and
it
is
still
true
that
landing
an
aeroplane
except
upon
a
and
quite
level
expanse
is
a
risky
and
uncomfortable
business
but
getting
up
and
landing
upon
fairly
smooth
water
is
easier
than
getting
into
bed
this
alone
is
likely
to
determine
the
aeroplane
routes
along
the
line
of
the
world
coastlines
and
lake
groups
and
waterways
the
airmen
will
go
to
and
fro
over
water
as
the
midges
do
wherever
there
is
a
square
mile
of
water
the
waterplanes
will
come
and
go
like
hornets
at
the
mouth
of
their
nest
but
there
are
much
stronger
reasons
than
this
convenience
for
keeping
over
water
over
water
the
air
it
seems
lies
in
great
level
expanses
even
when
there
are
gales
it
moves
in
uniform
masses
like
the
swift
still
rush
of
a
deep
river
the
airman
in
phrase
can
go
to
sleep
on
it
but
over
the
land
and
for
thousands
of
feet
up
into
the
sky
the
air
is
more
irregular
than
a
torrent
among
rocks
it
is
if
only
we
could
see
it
a
waving
whirling
eddying
flamboyant
confusion
a
slight
hill
a
ploughed
field
the
streets
of
a
town
create
riotous
rolling
invisible
streams
and
cataracts
of
air
that
catch
the
airman
unawares
make
him
drop
disconcertingly
try
his
nerves
with
a
powerful
enough
engine
he
climbs
at
once
again
but
these
sudden
downfalls
are
the
least
pleasant
and
most
dangerous
experience
in
aviation
they
exact
a
tiring
vigilance
over
lake
or
sea
in
sunshine
within
sight
of
land
this
is
the
perfect
way
of
the
flying
tourist
gladly
would
i
have
set
out
for
france
this
morning
instead
of
returning
to
eastbourne
and
then
coasted
round
to
spain
and
into
the
mediterranean
and
so
by
leisurely
stages
to
india
and
the
east
indies
i
find
my
study
unattractive
off
the
chain
i
was
ill
in
bed
reading
samuel
warren
ten
thousand
a
year
and
noting
how
much
the
world
can
change
in
seventy
years
i
had
just
got
to
the
journey
of
titmouse
from
london
to
yorkshire
in
that
coach
he
bought
in
long
acre
where
now
the
are
sold
when
there
came
a
telegram
to
bid
me
note
how
a
certain
holt
was
upon
the
ocean
coming
back
to
england
from
a
little
excursion
he
had
left
london
last
saturday
week
at
midday
he
hoped
to
be
back
by
thursday
and
he
had
talked
to
the
president
in
washington
visited
philadelphia
and
had
a
comparatively
loitering
afternoon
in
new
york
what
had
i
to
say
about
it
firstly
that
i
wish
this
article
could
be
written
by
samuel
warren
and
failing
that
i
wish
that
charles
dickens
who
wrote
in
his
american
notes
with
such
passionate
disgust
and
hostility
about
the
first
cunarder
retailing
all
the
discomfort
and
misery
of
crossing
the
atlantic
by
steamship
could
have
shared
holt
experience
because
i
am
chiefly
impressed
by
the
fact
not
that
holt
has
taken
days
where
weeks
were
needed
fifty
years
ago
but
that
he
has
done
it
very
comfortably
without
undue
physical
exertion
and
at
no
greater
expense
i
suppose
than
it
cost
dickens
whom
the
journey
nearly
killed
if
holt
expenses
were
higher
it
was
for
the
special
trains
and
the
sake
of
the
record
anyone
taking
ordinary
trains
and
ordinary
passages
may
do
what
he
has
done
in
eighteen
or
twenty
days
when
i
was
a
boy
around
the
world
in
eighty
days
was
still
a
brilliant
piece
of
imaginative
fiction
now
that
is
almost
an
pace
it
will
not
be
very
long
before
a
man
will
be
able
to
go
round
the
world
if
he
wishes
to
do
so
ten
times
in
a
year
and
it
is
perhaps
forgivable
if
those
who
like
jules
verne
saw
all
these
increments
in
speed
and
airships
aeroplanes
and
submarines
wireless
telegraphy
and
what
not
as
plain
and
necessary
deductions
from
the
promises
of
physical
science
should
turn
upon
a
world
that
read
and
doubted
and
jeered
with
i
told
you
so
will
you
respect
a
prophet
it
was
not
that
the
prophets
professed
any
mystical
and
inexplicable
illumination
at
which
a
sceptic
might
reasonably
mock
they
were
prepared
with
ample
reasons
for
the
things
they
foretold
now
quite
as
confidently
they
point
on
to
a
new
series
of
consequences
high
probabilities
that
follow
on
all
this
tremendous
development
of
swift
secure
and
cheapened
locomotion
just
as
they
followed
almost
necessarily
upon
the
mechanical
developments
of
the
last
century
briefly
the
ties
that
bind
men
to
place
are
being
severed
we
are
in
the
beginning
of
a
new
phase
in
human
experience
for
endless
ages
man
led
the
hunting
life
migrating
after
his
food
camping
homeless
as
to
this
day
are
many
of
the
indians
and
esquimaux
in
the
hudson
bay
territory
then
began
agriculture
and
for
the
sake
of
securer
food
man
tethered
himself
to
a
place
the
history
of
progress
from
savagery
to
civilisation
is
essentially
a
story
of
settling
down
it
begins
in
caves
and
shelters
it
culminates
in
a
wide
spectacle
of
farms
and
peasant
villages
and
little
towns
among
the
farms
there
were
wars
crusades
barbarous
invasions
but
to
that
state
all
asia
europe
north
africa
worked
its
way
with
an
indomitable
pertinacity
the
enormous
majority
of
human
beings
stayed
at
home
at
last
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
they
lived
married
died
in
the
same
district
usually
in
the
same
village
and
to
that
condition
law
custom
habits
morals
have
adapted
themselves
the
whole
plan
and
conception
of
human
society
is
based
on
the
rustic
home
and
the
needs
and
characteristics
of
the
agricultural
family
there
have
been
gipsies
wanderers
knaves
and
adventurers
no
doubt
but
the
settled
permanent
rustic
home
and
the
tenure
of
land
about
it
and
the
hens
and
the
cow
have
constituted
the
fundamental
reality
of
the
whole
scene
now
the
really
wonderful
thing
in
this
astonishing
development
of
cheap
abundant
swift
locomotion
we
have
seen
in
the
last
seventy
years
in
the
development
of
which
mauretanias
aeroplanes
expresses
tubes
and
motor
cars
are
just
the
bright
remarkable
points
is
this
that
it
dissolves
almost
all
the
reason
and
necessity
why
men
should
go
on
living
permanently
in
any
one
place
or
rigidly
disciplined
to
one
set
of
conditions
the
former
attachment
to
the
soil
ceases
to
be
an
advantage
the
human
spirit
has
never
quite
subdued
itself
to
the
laborious
and
established
life
it
achieves
its
best
with
variety
and
occasional
vigorous
exertion
under
the
stimulus
of
novelty
rather
than
by
constant
toil
and
this
revolution
in
human
locomotion
that
brings
nearly
all
the
globe
within
a
few
days
of
any
man
is
the
most
striking
aspect
of
the
unfettering
again
of
the
old
restless
wandering
adventurous
tendencies
in
composition
already
one
can
note
remarkable
developments
of
migration
there
is
for
example
that
flow
to
and
fro
across
the
atlantic
of
labourers
from
the
mediterranean
italian
workmen
by
the
hundred
thousand
go
to
the
united
states
in
the
spring
and
return
in
the
autumn
again
there
is
a
stream
of
thousands
of
prosperous
americans
to
summer
in
europe
compared
with
any
european
country
the
whole
population
of
the
united
states
is
fluid
equally
notable
is
the
enormous
proportion
of
the
british
prosperous
which
winters
either
in
the
high
alps
or
along
the
riviera
england
is
rapidly
developing
the
former
irish
grievance
of
an
absentee
propertied
class
it
is
only
now
by
the
most
strenuous
artificial
banking
back
that
migrations
on
a
far
huger
scale
from
india
into
africa
and
from
china
and
japan
into
australia
and
america
are
prevented
all
the
indications
point
to
a
time
when
it
will
be
an
altogether
exceptional
thing
for
a
man
to
follow
one
occupation
in
one
place
all
his
life
and
still
rarer
for
a
son
to
follow
in
his
father
footsteps
or
die
in
his
father
house
the
thing
is
as
simple
as
the
rule
of
three
we
are
off
the
chain
of
locality
for
good
and
all
it
was
necessary
heretofore
for
a
man
to
live
in
immediate
contact
with
his
occupation
because
the
only
way
for
him
to
reach
it
was
to
have
it
at
his
door
and
the
cost
and
delay
of
transport
were
relatively
too
enormous
for
him
to
shift
once
he
was
settled
he
may
live
twenty
or
thirty
miles
away
from
his
occupation
and
it
often
pays
him
to
spend
the
small
amount
of
time
and
money
needed
to
move
it
may
be
round
the
world
to
healthier
conditions
or
more
profitable
employment
and
with
every
diminution
in
the
cost
and
duration
of
transport
it
becomes
more
and
more
possible
and
more
and
more
likely
to
be
profitable
to
move
great
multitudes
of
workers
seasonally
between
regions
where
work
is
needed
in
this
season
and
regions
where
work
is
needed
in
that
they
can
go
out
to
the
agricultural
lands
at
one
time
and
come
back
into
towns
for
artistic
work
and
organised
work
in
factories
at
another
they
can
move
from
rain
and
darkness
into
sunshine
and
from
heat
into
the
coolness
of
mountain
forests
children
can
be
sent
for
education
to

beaches
and
healthy
mountains
men
will
harvest
in
saskatchewan
and
come
down
in
great
liners
to
spend
the
winter
working
in
the
forests
of
yucatan
people
have
hardly
begun
to
speculate
about
the
consequences
of
the
return
of
humanity
from
a
closely
tethered
to
a
migratory
existence
it
is
here
that
the
prophet
finds
his
chief
opportunity
obviously
these
great
forces
of
transport
are
already
straining
against
the
limits
of
existing
political
areas
every
country
contains
now
an
increasing
ingredient
of
unenfranchised
uitlanders
every
country
finds
a
growing
section
of
its
people
either
living
largely
abroad
drawing
the
bulk
of
their
income
from
the
exterior
and
having
their
essential
interests
wholly
or
partially
across
the
frontier
in
every
locality
of
a
western
european
country
countless
people
are
found
delocalised
uninterested
in
the
affairs
of
that
particular
locality
and
capable
of
moving
themselves
with
a
minimum
of
loss
and
a
maximum
of
facility
into
any
other
region
that
proves
more
attractive
in
america
political
life
especially
state
life
as
distinguished
from
national
political
life
is
degraded
because
of
the
natural
and
inevitable
apathy
of
a
large
portion
of
the
population
whose
interests
go
beyond
the
state
politicians
and
statesmen
being
the
last
people
in
the
world
to
notice
what
is
going
on
in
it
are
making
no
attempt
whatever
to
this
hugely
growing
floating
population
of
delocalised
people
to
the
public
service
as
marriott
puts
it
in
his
novel
they
drop
out
from
politics
as
we
understand
politics
at
present
local
administration
falls
almost
entirely
and
the
decision
of
imperial
affairs
tends
more
and
more
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
that
dwindling
and
adventurous
moiety
which
sits
tight
in
one
place
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
no
one
has
yet
invented
any
method
for
the
political
expression
and
collective
direction
of
a
migratory
population
and
nobody
is
attempting
to
do
so
it
is
a
new
problem
here
then
is
a
curious
prospect
the
prospect
of
a
new
kind
of
people
a
floating
population
going
about
the
world
uprooted
delocalised
and
even
it
may
be
denationalised
with
wide
interests
and
wide
views
developing
no
doubt
customs
and
habits
of
its
own
a
morality
of
its
own
a
philosophy
of
its
own
and
yet
from
the
point
of
view
of
current
politics
and
legislation
unorganised
and
ineffective
most
of
the
forces
of
international
finance
and
international
business
enterprise
will
be
with
it
it
will
develop
its
own
characteristic
standards
of
art
and
literature
and
conduct
in
accordance
with
its
new
necessities
it
is
i
believe
the
mankind
of
the
future
and
the
last
thing
it
will
be
able
to
do
will
be
to
legislate
the
history
of
the
immediate
future
will
i
am
convinced
be
very
largely
the
history
of
the
conflict
of
the
needs
of
this
new
population
with
the
institutions
the
boundaries
the
laws
prejudices
and
traditions
established
during
the
localised
era
of
mankind
career
this
conflict
follows
as
inevitably
upon
these
new
gigantic
facilities
of
locomotion
as
the
followed
from
the
discoveries
of
steam
and
steel
of
the
new
reign
the
bunting
and
the
crimson
vanish
from
the
streets
already
the
vast
army
of
improvised
carpenters
that
the
coronation
has
created
set
themselves
to
the
work
of
demolition
and
soon
every
road
that
converges
upon
central
london
will
be
choked
again
with
great
loads
of
timber
but
this
time
going
outward
as
our
capital
emerges
from
this
unprecedented
inundation
of
loyalty
the
most
elaborately
conceived
the
most
stately
of
all
recorded
british
coronations
is
past
what
new
phase
in
the
life
of
our
nation
and
our
empire
does
this
tremendous
ceremony
inaugurate
the
question
is
inevitable
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
social
existence
of
men
so
full
of
challenge
as
the
crowning
of
a
king
it
is
the
end
of
the
overture
the
curtain
rises
this
is
a
new
for
histories
to
us
the
great
mass
of
common
englishmen
who
have
no
place
in
the
hierarchy
of
our
land
who
do
not
attend
courts
nor
encounter
uniforms
whose
function
is
at
most
spectacular
who
stand
in
the
street
and
watch
the
dignitaries
and
the
liveries
pass
by
this
sense
of
critical
expectation
is
perhaps
greater
than
it
is
for
those
more
immediately
concerned
in
the
spectacle
they
have
had
their
parts
to
play
their
symbolic
acts
to
perform
they
have
sat
in
their
privileged
places
and
we
have
waited
at
the
barriers
until
their
comfort
and
dignity
was
assured
i
can
conceive
many
of
them
a
little
fatigued
preparing
now
for
social
dispersal
relaxing
comfortably
into
gossip
discussing
the
detail
of
these
events
with
an
air
of
things
accomplished
they
will
decide
whether
the
coronation
has
been
a
success
and
whether
everything
has
or
has
not
passed
off
very
well
for
us
in
the
great
crowd
nothing
has
as
yet
succeeded
or
passed
off
well
or
we
are
intent
upon
a
king
newly
anointed
and
crowned
a
king
of
whom
we
know
as
yet
very
little
but
who
has
nevertheless
roused
such
expectation
as
no
king
before
him
has
done
since
tudor
times
in
the
presence
of
gigantic
opportunities
there
is
a
conviction
widespread
among
us
his
own
words
perhaps
have
done
most
to
create
it
that
king
george
is
inspired
as
no
recent
predecessor
has
been
inspired
by
the
conception
of
kingship
that
his
is
to
be
no
rôle
of
almost
indifferent
abstinence
from
the
broad
processes
of
our
national
and
imperial
development
that
greater
public
life
which
is
above
party
and
above
creed
and
sect
has
we
are
told
taken
hold
of
his
imagination
he
is
to
be
no
crowned
image
of
unity
and
correlation
a
layer
of
and
a
signature
to
documents
but
an
actor
in
our
drama
a
living
prince
time
will
test
these
hopes
but
certainly
we
the
innumerable
democracy
of
individually
unimportant
men
have
felt
the
need
for
such
a
prince
our
consciousness
of
defects
of
fields
of
effort
untilled
of
vast
possibilities
neglected
and
slipping
away
from
us
for
ever
has
never
really
slumbered
again
since
the
chastening
experiences
of
the
boer
war
since
then
the
national
spirit
hampered
though
it
is
by
the
traditions
of
party
government
and
a
legacy
of
intellectual
and
social
heaviness
has
been
in
uneasy
and
ineffectual
revolt
against
deadness
against
stupidity
and
slackness
against
waste
and
hypocrisy
in
every
department
of
life
we
have
come
to
see
more
and
more
clearly
how
little
we
can
hope
for
from
politicians
societies
and
organised
movements
in
these
essential
things
it
is
this
that
has
invested
the
energy
and
manhood
the
untried
possibilities
of
the
new
king
with
so
radiant
a
light
of
hope
for
us
think
what
it
may
mean
for
us
all
i
write
as
one
of
that
great
multitude
sincerely
and
gravely
patriotic
outside
the
echoes
of
court
gossip
and
the
easy
knowledge
of
exalted
society
if
our
king
does
indeed
care
for
these
wider
and
profounder
things
suppose
we
have
a
king
at
last
who
cares
for
the
advancement
of
science
who
is
willing
to
do
the
hundred
things
that
are
so
easy
in
his
position
to
increase
research
to
honour
and
to
share
in
scientific
thought
suppose
we
have
a
king
whose
head
rises
above
the
level
of
the
court
artist
and
who
not
only
can
but
will
appeal
to
the
latent
and
discouraged
power
of
artistic
creation
in
our
race
suppose
we
have
a
king
who
understands
the
need
for
incessant
acute
criticism
to
keep
our
collective
activities
intelligent
and
efficient
and
for
a
flow
of
bold
unhampered
thought
through
every
department
of
the
national
life
a
king
liberal
without
laxity
and
patriotic
without
pettiness
or
vulgarity
such
it
seems
to
us
who
wait
at
present
almost
inexpressively
outside
the
immediate
clamours
of
a
mere
artificial
loyalty
are
the
splendid
possibilities
of
the
time
for
england
is
no
exhausted
or
decaying
country
it
is
rich
with
an
unmeasured
capacity
for
generous
responses
it
is
a
country
burthened
indeed
but
not
overwhelmed
by
the
gigantic
responsibilities
of
empire
a
little
relaxed
by
wealth
and
hampered
rather
than
enslaved
by
a
certain
shyness
of
temperament
a
certain
habitual
timidity
slovenliness
and
insincerity
of
mind
it
is
a
little
distrustful
of
intellectual
power
and
enterprise
a
little
awkward
and
ungracious
to
brave
and
beautiful
things
a
little
too
tolerant
of
dull
and
industrious
men
and
arrogant
old
women
it
suffers
hypocrites
gladly
because
its
criticism
is
poor
and
it
is
wastefully
harsh
to
frank
unorthodoxy
but
its
heart
is
sound
if
its
judgments
fall
short
of
acuteness
and
if
its
standards
of
achievement
are
low
it
needs
but
a
quickening
spirit
upon
the
throne
always
the
traditional
centre
of
its
respect
to
rise
from
even
the
appearance
of
decadence
there
is
a
new
quality
seeking
expression
in
england
like
the
rising
of
sap
in
the
spring
a
new
generation
asking
only
for
such
leadership
and
such
emancipation
from
restricted
scope
and
ungenerous
hostility
as
a
king
alone
can
give
it
when
in
its
turn
this
latest
reign
comes
at
last
to
its
reckoning
what
will
the
sum
of
its
achievement
be
what
will
it
leave
of
things
visible
will
it
leave
a
london
preserved
and
beautified
or
will
it
but
add
abundantly
to
the
lumps
of
dishonest
statuary
the
scars
and
masses
of
rebuilding
which
testify
to
the
aesthetic
degradation
of
the
victorian
period
will
a
great
constellation
of
artists
redeem
the
ambitious
sentimentalities
and
genteel
skilfulness
that
find
their
fitting
mausoleum
in
the
tate
gallery
will
our
literature
escape
at
last
from
pretentiousness
and
timidity
our
philosophy
from
the
foolish
cerebrations
of
university
characters
and
eminent
politicians
at
leisure
and
our
starved
science
find
scope
and
resources
adequate
to
its
gigantic
needs
will
our
universities
our
teaching
our
national
training
our
public
services
gain
a
new
health
from
the
reviving
vigour
of
the
national
brain
or
is
all
this
a
mere
wild
hope
and
shall
we
after
perhaps
some
small
flutterings
of
effort
the
foundation
of
some
ridiculous
little
academy
of
literary
busybodies
and
the
public
recognition
of
this
or
that
sociological
pretender
or
financial
scientist
and
a
little
polite
jobbery
with
relapse
into
lassitude
and
a
contented
acquiescence
in
the
rivalry
of
germany
and
the
united
states
for
the
moral
intellectual
and
material
leadership
of
the
world
the
deaths
and
accessions
of
kings
the
changing
of
names
and
coins
and
symbols
and
persons
a
little
force
our
minds
in
the
marking
off
of
epochs
we
are
brought
to
weigh
one
generation
against
another
to
reckon
up
our
position
and
note
the
characteristics
of
a
new
phase
what
lies
before
us
in
the
next
decades
is
england
going
on
to
fresh
achievements
to
a
renewed
and
increased
predominance
or
is
she
falling
into
a
secondary
position
among
the
peoples
of
the
world
the
answer
to
that
depends
upon
ourselves
have
we
pride
enough
to
attempt
still
to
lead
mankind
and
if
we
have
have
we
the
wisdom
and
the
quality
or
are
we
just
the
children
of
good
luck
who
are
being
found
out
some
years
ago
our
present
king
exhorted
this
island
to
wake
up
in
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
british
royal
utterances
and
owen
seaman
assures
him
in
verse
of
an
altogether
laureate
quality
that
we
are
now
free
of
the
snare
of
slumber
silken
bands
though
i
have
not
myself
observed
it
it
is
interesting
to
ask
is
england
really
waking
up
and
if
she
is
what
sort
of
awakening
is
she
likely
to
have
it
is
possible
of
course
to
wake
up
in
various
different
ways
there
is
the
clear
and
beautiful
dawn
of
new
and
balanced
effort
easy
unresting
planned
assured
and
there
is
also
the
of
a
still
man
irascible
clumsy
quarrelsome
who
stubs
his
toe
in
his
first
walk
across
the
room
smashes
his
too
persistent
alarum
clock
in
a
fit
of
nerves
and
cuts
his
throat
while
shaving
all
patriotic
vehemence
does
not
serve
one
country
exertion
is
a
more
critical
and
dangerous
thing
than
inaction
and
the
essence
of
success
is
in
the
ability
to
develop
those
qualities
which
make
action
effective
and
without
which
strenuousness
is
merely
a
clumsy
and
noisy
protest
against
inevitable
defeat
these
necessary
qualities
without
which
no
community
may
hope
for
are
a
passion
for
fine
and
brilliant
achievement
relentless
veracity
of
thought
and
method
and
richly
imaginative
fearlessness
of
enterprise
have
we
english
those
qualities
and
are
we
doing
our
utmost
to
select
and
develop
them
i
doubt
very
much
if
we
are
let
me
give
some
of
the
impressions
that
qualify
my
assurance
in
the
future
of
our
race
i
have
watched
a
great
deal
of
patriotic
effort
during
the
last
decade
i
have
seen
enormous
expenditures
of
will
emotion
and
material
for
the
sake
of
our
future
and
i
am
deeply
impressed
not
indeed
by
any
effect
of
lethargy
but
by
the
quality
and
the
shortness
and
weakness
of
aim
in
very
much
that
has
been
done
i
miss
continually
that
sharply
critical
imaginativeness
which
distinguishes
all
excellent
work
which
shines
out
supremely
in
cromwell
creation
of
the
new
model
or
nelson
plan
of
action
at
trafalgar
as
brightly
as
it
does
in
newton
investigation
of
gravitation
turner
rendering
of
landscape
or
shakespeare
choice
of
words
but
which
can
not
be
absent
altogether
if
any
achievement
is
to
endure
we
seem
to
have
busy
energetic
people
no
doubt
in
abundance
patient
and
industrious
administrators
and
legislators
but
have
we
any
adequate
supply
of
really
creative
ability
let
me
apply
this
question
to
one
matter
upon
which
england
has
certainly
been
profoundly
in
earnest
during
the
last
decade
we
have
been
almost
frantically
resolved
to
keep
the
empire
of
the
sea
but
have
we
really
done
all
that
could
have
been
done
i
ask
it
with
all
diffidence
but
has
our
naval
preparation
been
free
from
a
sort
of
noisy
violence
a
certain
massive
dullness
of
conception
have
we
really
made
anything
like
a
sane
use
of
our
resources
i
do
not
mean
of
our
resources
in
money
or
stuff
it
is
manifest
that
the
next
naval
war
will
be
beyond
all
precedent
a
war
of
mechanisms
giving
such
scope
for
invention
and
scientifically
equipped
wit
and
courage
as
the
world
has
never
had
before
now
have
we
really
developed
any
considerable
proportion
of
the
potential
human
quality
available
to
meet
the
demand
for
wits
what
are
we
doing
to
discover
encourage
and
develop
those
supreme
qualities
of
personal
genius
that
become
more
and
more
decisive
with
every
new
weapon
and
every
new
complication
and
unsuspected
possibility
it
introduces
suppose
for
example
there
was
among
us
a
adulterer
rather
fragile
prone
to
and
with
just
that
one
supreme
quality
of
imaginative
courage
which
made
nelson
our
starry
admiral
would
he
be
given
the
ghost
of
a
chance
now
of
putting
that
gift
at
his
country
disposal
i
do
not
think
he
would
and
i
do
not
think
he
would
because
we
underrate
gifts
and
exceptional
qualities
because
there
is
no
quickening
appreciation
for
the
exceptional
best
in
a
man
and
because
we
overvalue
the
good
behaviour
the
sound
physique
the
commonplace
virtues
of
mediocrity
i
have
but
the
knowledge
of
the
man
in
the
street
in
these
things
though
once
or
twice
i
have
chanced
on
prophecy
and
i
am
uneasily
apprehensive
of
the
quality
of
all
our
naval
preparations
we
go
on
launching
these
lumping
great
dreadnoughts
and
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
in
them
they
seem
vulnerable
from
the
air
above
and
the
deep
below
vulnerable
in
a
shallow
channel
and
in
a
fog
and
the
north
sea
is
both
foggy
and
shallow
and
immensely
costly
if
i
were
lord
high
admiral
of
england
at
war
i
would
not
fight
the
things
i
would
as
soon
put
to
sea
in
paul
cathedral
if
i
were
fighting
germany
i
would
stow
half
of
them
away
in
the
clyde
and
half
in
the
bristol
channel
and
take
the
good
men
out
of
them
and
fight
with
mines
and
torpedoes
and
destroyers
and
airships
and
submarines
and
when
i
come
to
military
matters
my
persuasion
that
things
are
not
all
right
that
our
current
hostility
to
imaginative
activity
and
our
dull
acceptance
of
established
methods
and
traditions
is
leading
us
towards
grave
dangers
intensifies
in
south
africa
the
boers
taught
us
in
blood
and
bitterness
the
obvious
fact
that
barbed
wire
had
its
military
uses
and
over
the
high
passes
on
the
way
to
lhassa
though
luckily
it
led
to
no
disaster
there
was
not
a
rifle
in
condition
to
use
because
we
had
not
thought
to
take
glycerine
the
perpetual
novelty
of
modern
conditions
demands
an
imaginative
alertness
we
eliminate
i
do
not
believe
that
the
army
council
or
anyone
in
authority
has
worked
out
a
tithe
of
the
essential
problems
of
contemporary
war
if
they
have
then
it
does
not
show
our
military
imagination
is
back
to
bows
and
arrows
the
other
day
i
saw
a
detachment
of
the
legion
of
frontiersmen
disporting
itself
at
totteridge
i
presume
these
young
heroes
consider
they
are
preparing
for
a
possible
conflict
in
england
or
western
europe
and
i
presume
the
authorities
are
satisfied
with
them
it
is
at
any
rate
the
only
serious
war
of
which
there
is
any
manifest
probability
western
europe
is
now
a
network
of
railways
tramways
high
roads
wires
of
all
sorts
its
chief
beasts
of
burthen
are
the
railway
train
and
the
motor
car
and
the
bicycle
towns
and
hypertrophied
villages
are
often
practically
continuous
over
large
areas
there
is
abundant
water
and
food
and
the
commonest
form
of
cover
is
the
house
but
the
legion
of
frontiersmen
is
equipped
for
war
oh
in
arizona
in
and
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
judge
the
most
modern
sections
of
the
army
extant
are
organised
for
a
colonial
war
in
say
or
there
is
of
course
a
considerable
amount
of
vague
energy
demanding
conscription
and
urging
our
youth
towards
a
familiarity
with
arms
and
the
backwoodsman
life
but
of
any
purpose
in
our
arming
widely
understood
of
any
realisation
of
what
would
have
to
be
done
and
where
it
would
have
to
be
done
and
of
any
attempts
to
create
an
instrument
for
that
novel
unprecedented
undertaking
i
discover
no
trace
in
my
capacity
of
devil
advocate
pleading
against
national
i
might
go
on
to
the
quality
of
our
social
and
political
movements
one
hears
nowadays
a
vast
amount
of
chatter
about
efficiency
that
magic
word
and
social
organisation
and
there
is
no
doubt
a
huge
expenditure
of
energy
upon
these
things
and
a
widespread
desire
to
rush
about
and
make
showy
and
startling
changes
but
it
does
not
follow
that
this
involves
progress
if
the
enterprise
itself
is
dully
conceived
and
most
of
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
dully
conceived
in
the
absence
of
penetrating
criticism
any
impudent
industrious
person
may
set
up
as
an
expert
organise
and
direct
the
confused
good
intentions
at
large
and
muddle
disastrously
with
the
problem
in
hand
the
expert
quack
and
the
bureaucratic
intriguer
increase
and
multiply
in
a
uncritical
strenuous
period
as
disease
germs
multiply
in
darkness
and
heat
i
find
the
same
doubts
of
our
quality
assail
me
when
i
turn
to
the
supreme
business
of
education
it
is
true
we
all
seem
alive
nowadays
to
the
need
of
education
are
all
prepared
for
more
expenditure
upon
it
and
more
but
it
does
not
follow
necessarily
in
a
period
of
stagnating
imagination
that
we
shall
get
what
we
pay
for
the
other
day
i
discovered
my
little
boy
doing
a
subtraction
sum
and
i
found
he
was
doing
it
in
a
slower
clumsier
less
businesslike
way
than
the
one
i
was
taught
in
an
commercial
academy
thirty
odd
years
ago
the
educational
expert
it
seems
has
been
at
work
substituting
a
bad
method
for
a
good
one
in
our
schools
because
it
is
easier
of
exposition
the
educational
expert
in
the
lack
of
a
lively
public
intelligence
develops
all
the
vices
of
the
energetic
and
he
is
i
am
only
too
disposed
to
believe
making
a
terrible
mess
of
a
great
deal
of
our
science
teaching
and
of
the
teaching
of
mathematics
and
english
i
have
written
enough
to
make
clear
the
quality
of
my
doubts
i
think
the
english
mind
cuts
at
life
with
a
dulled
edge
and
that
its
energy
may
be
worse
than
its
somnolence
i
think
it
undervalues
gifts
and
fine
achievement
and
overvalues
the
commonplace
virtues
of
mediocre
men
one
of
the
greatest
liberal
statesmen
in
the
time
of
queen
victoria
never
held
office
because
he
was
associated
with
a
divorce
case
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
for
him
to
have
taken
office
would
have
been
regarded
as
a
scandal
but
it
is
not
regarded
as
a
scandal
that
our
government
includes
men
of
no
more
ability
than
any
average
assistant
behind
a
grocer
counter
these
are
your
gods
o
england
and
with
every
desire
to
be
optimistic
i
find
it
hard
under
the
circumstances
to
anticipate
that
the
new
epoch
is
likely
to
be
a
blindingly
brilliant
time
for
our
empire
and
our
race
will
the
empire
live
what
will
hold
such
an
empire
as
the
british
together
this
great
laxly
scattered
association
of
ancient
states
and
countries
oriental
nations
and
continental
colonies
what
will
enable
it
to
resist
the
endless
internal
strains
the
inevitable
external
pressures
and
attacks
to
which
it
must
be
subjected
this
is
the
primary
question
for
british
imperialism
everything
else
is
secondary
or
subordinated
to
that
there
is
a
multitude
of
answers
but
i
suppose
most
of
them
will
prove
under
examination
either
to
be
or
to
lead
to
or
to
imply
very
distinctly
this
generalisation
that
if
most
of
the
intelligent
and
active
people
in
the
empire
want
it
to
continue
it
will
and
that
if
a
large
proportion
of
such
active
and
intelligent
people
are
discontented
and
estranged
nothing
can
save
it
from
disintegration
i
do
not
suppose
that
a
navy
ten
times
larger
than
ours
or
conscription
of
the
most
irksome
thoroughness
could
oblige
canada
to
remain
in
the
empire
if
the
general
will
and
feeling
of
canada
were
against
it
or
coerce
india
into
a
sustained
submission
if
india
presented
a
united
and
resistant
front
our
empire
for
all
its
roll
of
battles
was
not
created
by
force
colonisation
and
diplomacy
have
played
a
far
larger
share
in
its
growth
than
conquest
and
there
is
no
such
strength
in
its
sovereignty
as
the
rule
of
pride
and
pressure
demand
it
is
to
the
free
consent
and
participation
of
its
constituent
peoples
that
we
must
look
for
its
continuance
a
large
and
influential
body
of
politicians
considers
that
in
preferential
trading
between
the
parts
of
the
empire
and
in
the
erection
of
a
tariff
wall
against
exterior
peoples
lies
the
secret
of
that
deepened
emotional
understanding
we
all
desire
i
have
never
belonged
to
that
school
i
am
no
impassioned
free
trader
the
sacred
principle
of
free
trade
has
always
impressed
me
as
a
piece
of
party
claptrap
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
how
an
attempt
to
draw
together
dominions
so
scattered
and
various
as
ours
by
a
network
of
fiscal
manipulation
could
end
in
anything
but
mutual
inconvenience
mutual
irritation
and
disruption
in
an
open
drawer
in
my
bureau
there
lies
before
me
now
a
crumpled
card
on
which
are
the
notes
i
made
of
a
former
discussion
of
this
very
issue
a
discussion
between
a
number
of
prominent
politicians
in
the
days
before
chamberlain
return
from
south
africa
and
the
adoption
of
tariff
reform
by
the
unionist
party
and
i
decipher
again
the
same
considerations
unanswered
and
unanswerable
that
leave
me
sceptical
take
a
map
of
the
world
and
consider
the
extreme
differences
in
position
and
condition
between
our
scattered
states
here
is
canada
lying
along
the
united
states
looking
eastward
to
japan
and
china
westward
to
all
europe
see
the
great
slashes
of
lake
bay
and
mountain
chain
that
cut
it
meridianally
obviously
its
main
routes
and
trades
and
relations
lie
naturally
north
and
south
obviously
its
full
development
can
only
be
attained
with
those
ways
free
open
and
active
conceivably
you
may
build
a
fiscal
wall
across
the
continent
conceivably
you
may
shut
off
the
east
and
half
the
west
by
impossible
tariffs
and
narrow
its
trade
to
one
artificial
duct
to
england
but
only
at
the
price
of
a
hampered
development
it
will
be
like
nourishing
the
growing
body
of
a
man
with
the
heart
and
arteries
of
a
mouse
then
here
again
are
new
zealand
and
australia
facing
south
america
and
the
teeming
countries
of
eastern
asia
surely
it
is
in
relation
to
these
vast
proximities
that
their
economic
future
lies
is
it
possible
to
believe
that
shipping
mutton
to
london
is
anything
but
the
mere
beginning
of
their
commercial
development
look
at
india
again
and
south
africa
is
it
not
manifest
that
from
the
economic
and
business
points
of
view
each
of
these
is
an
entirely
separate
entity
a
system
apart
under
distinct
necessities
needing
entire
freedom
to
make
its
own
bargains
and
control
its
trade
in
its
own
way
in
order
to
achieve
its
fullest
material
possibilities
nor
can
i
believe
that
financial
entanglements
greatly
strengthen
the
bonds
of
an
empire
in
any
case
we
lost
the
american
colonies
because
we
interfered
with
their
fiscal
arrangements
and
it
was
napoleon
attempt
to
strangle
the
continental
trade
with
great
britain
that
began
his
downfall
i
do
not
find
in
the
ordinary
relations
of
life
that
business
relations
necessarily
sustain
intercourse
the
relations
of
buyer
and
seller
are
ticklish
relations
very
liable
to
strains
and
conflicts
i
do
not
find
people
grow
fond
of
their
butchers
and
plumbers
and
i
doubt
whether
if
one
were
obliged
by
some
special
taxation
to
deal
only
with
one
butcher
or
one
plumber
it
would
greatly
endear
the
relationship
forced
buying
is
irritated
buying
and
it
is
the
forbidden
shop
that
contains
the
coveted
goods
nor
do
i
find
to
take
another
instance
among
the
hotel
staffs
of
switzerland
and
the
riviera
who
live
almost
entirely
upon
british
gold
those
impassioned
british
imperialist
views
the
economic
link
theory
would
lead
me
to
expect
and
another
link
too
upon
which
much
stress
is
laid
but
about
which
i
have
very
grave
doubts
is
the
possibility
of
a
unified
organisation
of
the
empire
for
military
defence
we
are
to
have
it
is
suggested
an
imperial
army
and
an
imperial
navy
and
so
far
no
doubt
as
the
guaranteeing
of
a
general
peace
goes
we
may
develop
a
sense
of
participation
in
that
way
but
it
is
well
in
these
islands
to
remember
that
our
extraordinary
empire
has
no
common
enemy
to
weld
it
together
from
without
it
is
too
usual
to
regard
germany
as
the
common
enemy
we
in
great
britain
are
now
intensely
jealous
of
germany
we
are
intensely
jealous
of
germany
not
only
because
the
germans
outnumber
us
and
have
a
much
larger
and
more
diversified
country
than
ours
and
lie
in
the
very
heart
and
body
of
europe
but
because
in
the
last
hundred
years
while
we
have
fed
on
platitudes
and
vanity
they
have
had
the
energy
and
humility
to
develop
a
splendid
system
of
national
education
to
toil
at
science
and
art
and
literature
to
develop
social
organisation
to
master
and
better
our
methods
of
business
and
industry
and
to
clamber
above
us
in
the
scale
of
civilisation
this
has
humiliated
and
irritated
rather
than
chastened
us
and
our
irritation
has
been
greatly
exacerbated
by
the
swaggering
bad
manners
the
talk
of
blood
and
iron
and
mailed
fists
the
rubbish
that
inaugurated
the
new
german
phase
the
british
therefore
is
full
of
an
angry
vague
disposition
to
thwart
that
expansion
which
germans
regard
very
reasonably
as
their
natural
destiny
there
are
all
the
possibilities
of
a
huge
conflict
in
that
disposition
and
it
is
perhaps
well
to
remember
how
insular
or
at
least
how
european
the
essentials
of
this
quarrel
are
we
have
lost
our
tempers
but
canada
has
not
there
is
nothing
in
germany
to
make
canada
envious
and
ashamed
of
wasted
years
canada
has
no
natural
quarrel
with
germany
nor
has
india
nor
south
africa
nor
australasia
they
have
no
reason
to
share
our
insular
exasperation
on
the
other
hand
all
these
states
have
other
special
preoccupations
new
zealand
for
example
having
spent
half
a
century
and
more
in
land
legislation
suppressing
its
drink
traffic
lowering
its
and
in
short
the
achievement
of
an
ideal
preventive
materialism
is
chiefly
consumed
by
hate
and
fear
of
japan
which
in
the
same
interval
has
made
a
stride
from
the
thirteenth
to
the
twentieth
century
and
which
teems
with
art
and
life
and
enterprise
and
offspring
now
japan
in
is
our
ally
you
see
the
british
empire
has
no
common
economic
interests
and
no
natural
common
enemy
it
is
not
adapted
to
any
form
of
zollverein
or
any
form
of
united
aggression
visibly
on
the
map
of
the
world
it
has
a
likeness
to
open
hands
while
the
german
empire
except
for
a
few
and
imitative
colonies
is
clenched
into
a
central
european
unity
physically
our
empire
is
incurably
scattered
various
and
divided
and
it
is
to
quite
other
links
and
forces
it
seems
to
me
than
fiscal
or
military
unification
that
we
who
desire
its
continuance
must
look
to
hold
it
together
there
never
was
anything
like
it
before
essentially
it
is
an
adventure
of
the
british
spirit
sanguine
discursive
and
beyond
comparison
insubordinate
adaptable
and
originating
it
has
been
made
by
odd
and
irregular
means
by
trading
companies
pioneers
explorers
unauthorised
seamen
adventurers
like
clive
eccentrics
like
gordon
invalids
like
rhodes
it
has
been
made
in
spite
of
authority
and
officialdom
as
no
other
empire
was
ever
made
the
nominal
rulers
of
britain
never
planned
it
it
happened
almost
in
spite
of
them
their
chief
contribution
to
its
history
has
been
the
loss
of
the
united
states
it
is
a
living
thing
that
has
arisen
not
a
dead
thing
put
together
beneath
the
thin
legal
and
administrative
ties
that
hold
it
together
lies
the
far
more
vital
bond
of
a
traditional
free
spontaneous
activity
it
has
a
common
medium
of
expression
in
the
english
tongue
a
unity
of
liberal
and
tolerant
purpose
amidst
its
enormous
variety
of
localised
life
and
colour
and
it
is
in
the
development
and
strengthening
the
enrichment
the
rendering
more
conscious
and
more
purposeful
of
that
broad
creative
spirit
of
the
british
that
the
true
cement
and
continuance
of
our
empire
is
to
be
found
the
empire
must
live
by
the
forces
that
begot
it
it
can
not
hope
to
give
any
such
exclusive
prosperity
as
a
zollverein
might
afford
it
can
hold
out
no
hopes
of
collective
conquests
and
triumphs
its
utmost
military
rôle
must
be
the
guaranteeing
of
a
common
inaggressive
security
but
it
can
if
it
is
to
survive
it
must
give
all
its
constituent
parts
such
a
civilisation
as
none
of
them
could
achieve
alone
a
civilisation
a
wealth
and
fullness
of
life
increasing
and
developing
with
the
years
through
that
and
that
alone
can
it
be
made
worth
having
and
worth
serving
and
in
the
first
place
the
whole
empire
must
use
the
english
language
i
do
not
mean
that
any
language
must
be
stamped
out
that
a
thousand
languages
may
not
flourish
by
board
and
cradle
and
in
and
village
gossip
erse
the
taal
a
hundred
indian
and
other
eastern
tongues
canadian
french
but
i
mean
that
also
english
must
be
available
that
everywhere
there
must
be
english
teaching
and
everyone
who
wants
to
read
science
or
history
or
philosophy
to
come
out
of
the
village
life
into
wider
thoughts
and
broader
horizons
to
gain
appreciation
in
art
must
find
ready
to
hand
easily
attainable
in
english
all
there
is
to
know
and
all
that
has
been
said
thereon
it
is
worth
a
hundred
dreadnoughts
and
a
million
soldiers
to
the
empire
that
wherever
the
imperial
posts
reach
wherever
there
is
a
curious
or
receptive
mind
there
in
english
and
by
the
imperial
connection
the
full
thought
of
the
race
should
come
to
the
lonely
youth
upon
the
new
zealand
sheep
farm
to
the
young
hindu
to
the
trapper
under
a
labrador
tilt
to
the
assistant
at
a
burmese
to
the
scottish
miner
or
the
egyptian
clerk
the
empire
and
the
english
language
should
exist
visibly
and
certainly
as
the
media
by
which
his
spirit
escapes
from
his
immediate
surroundings
and
all
the
urgencies
of
every
day
into
a
limitless
fellowship
of
thought
and
beauty
now
i
am
not
writing
this
in
any
vague
rhetorical
way
i
mean
specifically
that
our
empire
has
to
become
the
medium
of
knowledge
and
thought
to
every
intelligent
person
in
it
or
that
it
is
bound
to
go
to
pieces
it
has
no
economic
no
military
no
racial
no
religious
unity
its
only
conceivable
unity
is
a
unity
of
language
and
purpose
and
outlook
if
it
is
not
held
together
by
thought
and
spirit
it
can
not
be
held
together
no
other
cement
exists
that
can
hold
it
together
indefinitely
not
only
english
literature
but
all
other
literatures
well
translated
into
english
and
all
science
and
all
philosophy
have
to
be
brought
within
the
reach
of
everyone
capable
of
availing
himself
of
such
reading
and
this
must
be
done
not
by
private
enterprise
or
for
gain
but
as
an
imperial
function
wherever
the
empire
extends
there
its
presence
must
signify
all
that
breadth
of
thought
and
outlook
no
localised
life
can
supply
only
so
is
it
possible
to
establish
and
maintain
the
wide
understandings
the
common
sympathy
necessary
to
our
continued
association
the
empire
mediately
or
immediately
must
become
the
universal
educator
and
vehicle
of
imaginative
inspiration
for
its
peoples
or
else
it
must
submit
to
the
gravitation
of
its
various
parts
to
new
and
more
invigorating
associations
no
empire
it
may
be
urged
has
ever
attempted
anything
of
this
sort
but
no
empire
like
the
british
has
ever
yet
existed
its
conditions
and
needs
are
unprecedented
its
consolidation
is
a
new
problem
to
be
solved
if
it
is
solved
at
all
by
untried
means
and
in
the
english
language
as
a
vehicle
of
thought
and
civilisation
alone
is
that
means
to
be
found
now
it
is
idle
to
pretend
that
at
the
present
time
the
british
empire
is
giving
its
constituent
peoples
any
such
high
and
rewarding
civilisation
as
i
am
here
suggesting
it
gives
them
a
certain
immunity
from
warfare
a
penny
post
an
occasional
spectacular
coronation
a
few
knighthoods
and
peerages
and
the
services
of
an
honest
unsympathetic
and
unattractive
officialism
no
adequate
effort
is
being
made
to
render
the
english
language
universal
throughout
its
limits
none
at
all
to
use
it
as
a
medium
of
thought
and
enlightenment
half
the
good
things
of
the
human
mind
are
outside
english
altogether
and
there
is
not
sufficient
intelligence
among
us
to
desire
to
bring
them
in
if
one
would
read
honest
and
able
criticism
one
must
learn
french
if
one
would
be
abreast
of
scientific
knowledge
and
philosophical
thought
or
see
many
good
plays
or
understand
the
contemporary
european
mind
german
and
yet
it
would
cost
amazingly
little
to
get
every
good
foreign
thing
done
into
english
as
it
appeared
it
needs
only
a
little
understanding
and
a
little
organisation
to
ensure
the
immediate
translation
of
every
significant
article
every
scientific
paper
of
the
slightest
value
the
effort
and
arrangement
needed
to
make
books
facilities
for
research
and
all
forms
of
art
accessible
throughout
the
empire
would
be
altogether
trivial
in
proportion
to
the
consolidation
it
would
effect
but
english
people
do
not
understand
these
things
their
empire
is
an
accident
it
was
made
for
them
by
their
exceptional
and
outcast
men
and
in
the
end
it
will
be
lost
i
fear
by
the
intellectual
inertness
of
their
commonplace
and
leaders
empire
has
happened
to
them
and
civilisation
has
happened
to
them
as
fresh
lettuces
come
to
tame
rabbits
they
do
not
understand
how
they
got
and
they
will
not
understand
how
to
keep
art
thought
literature
all
indeed
that
raises
men
above
locality
and
habit
all
that
can
justify
and
consolidate
the
empire
is
nothing
to
them
they
are
provincials
mocked
by
a
opportunity
the
stupid
legatees
of
a
great
generation
of
exiles
they
go
out
of
town
for
the
shootin
and
come
back
for
the
fooleries
of
parliament
and
to
see
what
the
censor
has
left
of
our
playwrights
and
sir
jesse
boot
of
our
writers
and
to
dine
in
restaurants
and
wear
clothes
mostly
they
call
themselves
imperialists
which
is
just
their
harmless
way
of
expressing
their
satisfaction
with
things
as
they
are
in
practice
their
imperialism
resolves
itself
into
a
vigorous
resistance
to
taxation
and
an
hostility
to
education
it
matters
nothing
to
them
that
the
whole
next
generation
of
canadians
has
drawn
its
ideas
mainly
from
american
publications
that
india
and
egypt
in
despite
of
sounder
mental
nourishment
have
developed
their
own
vernacular
press
that
australia
and
new
zealand
even
now
gravitate
to
america
for
books
and
thought
it
matters
nothing
to
them
that
the
poverty
and
insularity
of
our
intellectual
life
has
turned
american
art
to
france
and
italy
and
the
american
universities
towards
germany
the
slow
starvation
and
decline
of
our
philosophy
and
science
the
decadence
of
british
invention
and
enterprise
troubles
them
not
at
all
because
they
fail
to
connect
these
things
with
the
tangible
facts
of
empire
the
world
can
not
wait
for
the
english
and
the
sands
of
our
imperial
opportunity
twirl
through
the
neck
of
the
the
labour
unrest
sec
our
country
is
i
think
in
a
dangerous
state
of
social
disturbance
the
discontent
of
the
labouring
mass
of
the
community
is
deep
and
increasing
it
may
be
that
we
are
in
the
opening
phase
of
a
real
and
irreparable
class
war
since
the
coronation
we
have
moved
very
rapidly
indeed
from
an
assurance
of
extreme
social
stability
towards
the
recognition
of
a
spreading
disorganisation
it
is
idle
to
pretend
any
longer
that
these
labour
troubles
are
the
mere
give
and
take
of
economic
adjustment
no
adjustment
is
in
progress
new
and
strange
urgencies
are
at
work
in
our
midst
forces
for
which
the
word
revolutionary
is
only
too
faithfully
appropriate
nothing
is
being
done
to
allay
these
forces
everything
conspires
to
exasperate
them
whither
are
these
forces
taking
us
what
can
still
be
done
and
what
has
to
be
done
to
avoid
the
phase
of
social
destruction
to
which
we
seem
to
be
drifting
hitherto
in
great
britain
at
any
rate
the
working
man
has
shown
himself
a
being
of
the
most
limited
and
practical
outlook
his
narrowness
of
imagination
his
lack
of
general
ideas
has
been
the
despair
of
the
socialist
and
of
every
sort
of
revolutionary
theorist
he
may
have
struck
before
but
only
for
definite
increments
of
wages
or
definite
limitations
of
toil
his
acceptance
of
the
industrial
system
and
its
methods
has
been
as
complete
and
unquestioning
as
his
acceptance
of
earth
and
sky
now
with
an
effect
of
suddenness
this
ceases
to
be
the
case
a
new
generation
of
workers
is
seen
replacing
the
old
workers
of
a
quality
unfamiliar
to
the
and
elderly
men
who
still
manage
our
great
businesses
and
political
affairs
the
worker
is
beginning
now
to
strike
for
unprecedented
ends
against
the
system
against
the
fundamental
conditions
of
labour
to
strike
for
no
defined
ends
at
all
perplexingly
and
disconcertingly
the
strike
was
a
method
of
bargaining
clumsy
and
violent
perhaps
but
bargaining
still
the
strike
is
far
less
of
a
haggle
far
more
of
a
display
of
temper
the
first
thing
that
has
to
be
realised
if
the
labour
question
is
to
be
understood
at
all
is
this
that
the
temper
of
labour
has
changed
altogether
in
the
last
twenty
or
thirty
years
essentially
that
is
a
change
due
to
intelligence
not
merely
increased
but
greatly
stimulated
to
the
work
that
is
of
the
board
schools
and
of
the
cheap
press
the
outlook
of
the
workman
has
passed
beyond
the
works
and
his
beer
and
his
dog
he
has
become
or
rather
he
has
been
replaced
by
a
being
of
eyes
however
imperfect
and
of
criticism
however
hasty
and
unjust
the
working
man
of
reads
talks
has
general
ideas
and
a
sense
of
the
round
world
he
is
far
nearer
to
the
ruler
of
in
knowledge
and
intellectual
range
than
he
is
to
the
working
man
of
fifty
years
ago
the
politician
or
business
magnate
of
is
no
better
educated
and
very
little
better
informed
than
his
equals
were
fifty
years
ago
the
chief
difference
is
golf
the
working
man
questions
a
thousand
things
his
father
accepted
as
in
the
very
nature
of
the
world
and
among
others
he
begins
to
ask
with
the
utmost
alertness
and
persistence
why
it
is
that
he
in
particular
is
expected
to
toil
the
answer
the
only
justifiable
answer
should
be
that
that
is
the
work
for
which
he
is
fitted
by
his
inferior
capacity
and
culture
that
these
others
are
a
special
and
select
sort
very
specially
trained
and
prepared
for
their
responsibilities
and
that
at
once
brings
this
new
fact
of
a
criticism
of
social
values
into
play
the
old
workman
might
and
did
quarrel
very
vigorously
with
his
specific
employer
but
he
never
set
out
to
arraign
all
employers
he
took
the
law
and
the
church
and
statecraft
and
politics
for
the
higher
and
noble
things
they
claimed
to
be
he
wanted
an
extra
shilling
or
he
wanted
an
hour
of
leisure
and
that
was
as
much
as
he
wanted
the
young
workman
on
the
other
hand
has
put
the
whole
social
system
upon
its
trial
and
seems
quite
disposed
to
give
an
adverse
verdict
he
looks
far
beyond
the
older
conflict
of
interests
between
employer
and
employed
he
criticises
the
good
intentions
of
the
whole
system
of
governing
and
influential
people
and
not
only
their
good
intentions
but
their
ability
these
are
the
new
conditions
and
the
and
elderly
gentlemen
who
are
dealing
with
the
crisis
on
the
supposition
that
their
vast
experience
of
labour
questions
in
the
and
furnishes
valuable
guidance
in
this
present
issue
are
merely
bringing
the
gunpowder
of
misapprehension
to
the
revolutionary
fort
the
workman
of
the
new
generation
is
full
of
distrust
the
most
demoralising
of
social
influences
he
is
like
a
sailor
who
believes
no
longer
either
in
the
good
faith
or
seamanship
of
his
captain
and
between
desperation
and
contempt
contemplates
vaguely
but
persistently
the
assumption
of
control
by
a
collective
forecastle
he
is
like
a
private
soldier
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
nothing
can
save
the
situation
but
the
death
of
an
incompetent
officer
his
distrust
is
so
profound
that
he
ceases
not
only
to
believe
in
the
employer
but
he
ceases
to
believe
in
the
law
ceases
to
believe
in
parliament
as
a
means
to
that
tolerable
life
he
desires
and
he
falls
back
steadily
upon
his
last
resource
of
a
strike
and
if
by
repressive
tactics
we
make
it
so
a
criminal
strike
the
central
fact
of
all
this
present
trouble
is
that
distrust
there
is
only
one
way
in
which
our
present
drift
towards
revolution
or
revolutionary
disorder
can
be
arrested
and
that
is
by
restoring
the
confidence
of
these
alienated
millions
who
visibly
now
are
changing
from
loyalty
to
the
crown
from
a
simple
patriotism
from
habitual
industry
to
the
more
and
more
effective
expression
of
a
deepening
resentment
this
is
a
psychological
question
a
matter
of
mental
states
feats
of
legal
subtlety
are
inopportune
arithmetical
exploits
still
more
so
to
emerge
with
the
sum
of
as
a
minimum
by
calculating
on
the
basis
of
the
mine
present
earnings
from
a
conference
which
the
miners
and
everybody
else
imagined
was
to
give
a
minimum
of
may
be
clever
but
it
is
certainly
not
politic
in
the
present
stage
of
labour
feeling
to
stamp
violently
upon
obscure
newspapers
nobody
had
heard
of
before
and
send
a
printer
to
prison
and
to
give
thereby
a
flaming
advertisement
to
the
possible
use
of
soldiers
in
civil
conflicts
and
set
every
talking
may
be
permissible
but
it
is
certainly
very
the
distrust
deepens
the
real
task
before
a
governing
class
that
means
to
go
on
governing
is
not
just
at
present
to
get
the
better
of
an
argument
or
the
best
of
a
bargain
but
to
lay
hold
of
the
imaginations
of
this
drifting
sullen
and
suspicious
multitude
which
is
the
working
body
of
the
country
what
we
prosperous
people
who
have
nearly
all
the
good
things
of
life
and
most
of
the
opportunity
have
to
do
now
is
to
justify
ourselves
we
have
to
show
that
we
are
indeed
responsible
and
serviceable
willing
to
give
ourselves
and
to
give
ourselves
generously
for
what
we
have
and
what
we
have
had
we
have
to
meet
the
challenge
of
this
distrust
the
slack
days
for
rulers
and
owners
are
over
if
there
are
still
to
be
rulers
and
owners
and
managing
and
governing
people
then
in
the
face
of
the
new
masses
sensitive
intelligent
critical
irritable
as
no
common
people
have
ever
been
before
these
rulers
and
owners
must
be
prepared
to
make
themselves
and
display
themselves
wise
capable
and
heroic
beyond
any
aristocratic
precedent
the
alternative
if
it
is
an
alternative
is
resignation
to
the
social
democracy
and
it
is
just
because
we
are
all
beginning
to
realise
the
immense
need
for
this
heroic
quality
in
those
who
rule
and
are
rich
and
powerful
as
the
response
and
corrective
to
these
distrusts
and
jealousies
that
are
threatening
to
disintegrate
our
social
order
that
we
have
all
followed
the
details
of
this
great
catastrophe
in
the
atlantic
with
such
intense
solicitude
it
was
one
of
those
accidents
that
happen
with
a
precision
of
time
and
circumstance
that
outdoes
art
not
an
incident
in
it
all
that
was
not
supremely
typical
it
was
the
penetrating
comment
of
chance
upon
our
entire
social
situation
beneath
a
surface
of
magnificent
efficiency
was
the
passengers
had
placed
themselves
on
board
with
an
infinite
confidence
in
the
care
that
was
to
be
taken
of
them
and
they
went
down
and
most
of
their
women
and
children
went
down
with
the
cry
of
those
who
find
themselves
cheated
out
of
life
in
the
unfolding
record
of
behaviour
it
is
the
stewardesses
and
bandsmen
and
engineers
persons
of
the
class
who
shine
as
brightly
as
any
and
by
the
supreme
artistry
of
chance
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
that
tragic
and
unhappy
gentleman
bruce
ismay
to
be
aboard
and
to
be
caught
by
the
urgent
vacancy
in
the
boat
and
the
snare
of
the
moment
no
untried
man
dare
say
that
he
would
have
behaved
better
in
his
place
he
escaped
he
thought
it
natural
to
escape
his
class
thinks
it
was
right
and
proper
that
he
did
escape
it
is
not
the
man
i
would
criticise
but
the
manifest
absence
of
any
such
sense
of
the
supreme
dignity
of
his
position
as
would
have
sustained
him
in
that
crisis
he
was
a
rich
man
and
a
ruling
man
but
in
the
test
he
was
not
a
proud
man
in
the
common
man
realisation
that
such
is
indeed
the
case
with
most
of
those
who
dominate
our
world
lies
the
true
cause
and
danger
of
our
social
indiscipline
and
the
remedy
in
the
first
place
lies
not
in
social
legislation
and
so
forth
but
in
the
consciences
of
the
wealthy
heroism
and
a
generous
devotion
to
the
common
good
are
the
only
effective
answer
to
distrust
if
such
dominating
people
can
not
produce
these
qualities
there
will
have
to
be
an
end
to
them
and
the
world
must
turn
to
some
entirely
different
method
of
direction
sec
the
essential
trouble
in
our
growing
labour
disorder
is
the
profound
distrust
which
has
grown
up
in
the
minds
of
the
new
generation
of
workers
of
either
the
ability
or
the
good
faith
of
the
property
owning
ruling
and
directing
class
i
do
not
attempt
to
judge
the
justice
or
not
of
this
distrust
i
merely
point
to
its
existence
as
one
of
the
striking
and
essential
factors
in
the
contemporary
labour
situation
this
distrust
is
not
perhaps
the
proximate
cause
of
the
strikes
that
now
follow
each
other
so
disconcertingly
but
it
embitters
their
spirit
it
prevents
their
settlement
and
leads
to
their
renewal
i
have
tried
to
suggest
that
whatever
immediate
devices
for
pacification
might
be
employed
the
only
way
to
a
better
understanding
and
the
only
escape
from
a
social
slide
towards
the
unknown
possibilities
of
social
democracy
lies
in
an
exaltation
of
the
standard
of
achievement
and
of
the
sense
of
responsibility
in
the
possessing
and
governing
classes
it
is
not
so
much
wake
up
england
that
i
would
say
as
wake
up
gentlemen
for
the
new
generation
of
the
workers
is
beyond
all
question
quite
alarmingly
awake
and
critical
and
angry
and
they
have
not
merely
to
wake
up
they
have
to
wake
up
visibly
and
ostentatiously
if
those
old
class
reliances
on
which
our
system
is
based
are
to
be
preserved
and
restored
we
need
before
anything
else
a
restoration
of
class
confidence
it
is
a
time
when
class
should
speak
with
class
very
frankly
there
is
too
much
facile
misrepresentation
too
ready
a
disposition
on
either
side
to
accept
caricatures
as
portraits
and
charges
as
facts
however
tacit
our
understandings
were
in
the
past
with
this
new
kind
of
labour
this
young
restive
labour
of
the
twentieth
century
which
can
read
discuss
and
combine
we
need
something
in
the
nature
of
a
social
contract
and
it
is
when
one
comes
to
consider
by
what
possible
means
these
suspicious
passengers
in
our
leaking
and
imperilled
social
liner
can
be
brought
into
generous
with
the
second
and
the
first
that
one
discovers
just
how
lamentably
out
of
date
and
out
of
order
our
political
institutions
which
should
supply
the
means
for
just
this
discussion
have
become
between
the
busy
and
preoccupied
owning
and
employing
class
on
the
one
hand
and
the
distressed
uneasy
masses
on
the
other
intervenes
the
professional
politician
not
as
a
mediator
but
as
an
obstacle
who
must
be
propitiated
before
any
dealings
are
possible
our
national
politics
no
longer
express
the
realities
of
the
national
life
they
are
a
mere
impediment
in
the
speech
of
the
community
with
our
whole
social
order
in
danger
our
legislature
is
busy
over
the
trivial
little
affairs
of
the
welsh
established
church
whose
endowment
probably
is
not
equal
to
the
fortune
of
any
one
of
half
a
dozen
passengers
or
a
tithe
of
the
probable
loss
of
another
strike
among
the
miners
we
have
a
legislature
almost
antiquarian
compiling
a
museum
of
gladstonian
legacies
rather
than
governing
our
world
law
is
the
basis
of
civilisation
but
the
lawyer
is
the
consequence
and
with
us
at
least
the
legal
profession
is
the
political
profession
it
delights
in
false
issues
and
merely
technical
politics
steadily
with
the
ascendancy
of
the
house
of
commons
the
barristers
have
ousted
other
types
of
men
from
political
power
the
decline
of
the
house
of
lords
has
been
the
last
triumph
of
the
house
of
lawyers
and
we
are
governed
now
to
a
large
extent
not
so
much
by
the
people
for
the
people
as
by
the
barristers
for
the
barristers
they
set
the
tone
of
political
life
and
since
they
are
the
most
specialised
the
most
specifically
trained
of
all
the
professions
since
their
training
is
absolutely
antagonistic
to
the
creative
impulses
of
the
constructive
artist
and
the
controlled
experiments
of
the
scientific
man
since
the
business
is
with
evidence
and
advantages
and
the
skilful
use
of
evidence
and
advantages
and
not
with
understanding
they
are
the
least
statesmanlike
of
all
educated
men
and
they
give
our
public
life
a
tone
as
hopelessly
discordant
with
our
very
great
and
urgent
social
needs
as
one
could
well
imagine
they
do
not
want
to
deal
at
all
with
great
and
urgent
social
needs
they
play
a
game
a
long
and
interesting
game
with
parties
as
sides
a
game
that
rewards
the
industrious
player
with
prominence
place
power
and
great
rewards
and
the
less
that
game
involves
the
passionate
interests
of
other
men
the
less
it
draws
them
into
participation
and
angry
interference
the
better
for
the
steady
development
of
the
politician
career
a
distinguished
and
active
fruitlessness
leaving
the
world
at
last
as
he
found
it
is
the
political
barrister
ideal
career
to
achieve
that
he
must
maintain
legal
and
political
monopolies
and
prevent
the
invasion
of
political
life
by
living
interests
and
so
far
as
he
has
any
views
about
labour
beyond
the
margin
of
his
brief
the
barrister
politician
seems
to
regard
getting
men
back
to
work
on
any
terms
and
as
soon
as
possible
as
the
highest
good
and
it
is
with
such
men
that
our
insurgent
modern
labour
with
its
vaguely
apprehended
wants
its
large
occasions
and
its
rapid
emotional
reactions
comes
into
contact
directly
it
attempts
to
adjust
itself
in
the
social
body
it
is
one
of
the
main
factors
in
the
progressive
embitterment
of
the
labour
situation
that
whatever
business
is
afoot
arbitration
conciliation
inquiry
our
contemporary
system
presents
itself
to
labour
almost
invariably
in
a
legal
guise
the
natural
infirmities
of
humanity
rebel
against
an
unimaginative
legality
of
attitude
and
the
common
workaday
man
has
no
more
love
for
this
great
and
necessary
profession
than
he
had
in
the
time
of
jack
cade
little
reasonable
things
from
the
lawyers
point
of
view
the
rejection
for
example
of
certain
evidence
in
the
inquiry
because
it
might
amount
to
a
charge
of
manslaughter
the
constant
interruption
and
checking
of
a
labour
representative
at
the
same
tribunal
upon
trivial
points
irritate
quite
disproportionately
lawyer
and
working
man
are
antipathetic
types
and
it
is
a
very
grave
national
misfortune
that
at
this
time
when
our
situation
calls
aloud
for
statecraft
and
a
certain
greatness
of
treatment
our
public
life
should
be
dominated
as
it
has
never
been
dominated
before
by
this
most
able
and
illiberal
profession
now
for
that
great
multitude
of
prosperous
people
who
find
themselves
at
once
deeply
concerned
in
our
present
social
and
economic
crisis
and
either
helplessly
entangled
in
party
organisation
or
helplessly
outside
politics
the
elimination
and
cure
of
this
disease
of
statecraft
the
professional
politician
has
become
a
very
urgent
matter
to
destroy
him
to
get
him
back
to
his
law
courts
and
keep
him
there
it
is
necessary
to
destroy
the
machinery
of
the
party
system
that
sustains
him
and
to
adopt
some
electoral
method
that
will
no
longer
put
the
independent
representative
man
at
a
hopeless
disadvantage
against
the
party
nominee
such
a
method
is
to
be
found
in
proportional
representation
with
large
constituencies
and
to
that
we
must
look
for
our
ultimate
liberation
from
our
present
masters
these
politician
barristers
but
the
labour
situation
can
not
wait
for
this
millennial
release
and
for
the
current
issue
it
seems
to
me
patent
that
every
reasonable
prosperous
man
will
even
at
the
cost
to
himself
of
some
trouble
and
hard
thinking
do
his
best
to
keep
as
much
of
this
great
and
acute
controversy
as
he
possibly
can
out
of
the
lawyer
and
mere
politician
hands
and
in
his
own
leave
labour
to
the
lawyers
and
we
shall
go
very
deeply
into
trouble
indeed
before
this
business
is
over
they
will
score
their
points
they
will
achieve
remarkable
agreements
full
of
the
possibility
of
subsequent
surprises
they
will
make
reputations
and
do
everything
heaven
and
their
professional
training
have
made
them
to
do
and
they
will
exasperate
and
exasperate
lawyers
made
the
first
french
revolution
and
now
on
a
different
side
they
may
yet
bring
about
an
english
one
these
men
below
there
are
still
as
a
class
wonderfully
patient
and
reasonable
quite
prepared
to
take
orders
and
recognise
superior
knowledge
wisdom
and
nobility
they
make
the
most
reasonable
claims
for
a
tolerable
life
for
certain
assurances
and
certain
latitudes
implicit
rather
than
expressed
is
their
demand
for
wisdom
and
right
direction
from
those
to
whom
the
great
surplus
and
freedom
of
civilisation
are
given
it
is
an
entirely
reasonable
demand
if
man
is
indeed
a
social
animal
but
we
have
got
to
treat
them
fairly
and
openly
this
patience
and
reasonableness
and
willingness
for
leadership
is
not
limitless
it
is
no
good
scoring
our
mean
little
points
for
example
and
accusing
them
of
breach
of
contract
and
all
sorts
of
theoretical
wrongs
because
they
wo
abide
by
agreements
to
accept
a
certain
scale
of
wages
when
the
purchasing
power
of
money
has
declined
when
they
made
that
agreement
they
did
not
think
of
that
possibility
when
they
said
a
pound
they
thought
of
what
was
then
a
poundsworth
of
living
the
mint
has
since
been
increasing
its
annual
output
of
gold
coins
to
two
or
three
times
the
former
amount
and
we
have
as
it
were
debased
the
coinage
with
extraordinary
quantities
of
gold
but
we
who
know
and
own
did
nothing
to
adjust
that
we
did
not
tell
the
working
man
of
that
we
have
let
him
find
it
out
slowly
and
indirectly
at
the
grocer
shop
that
may
be
permissible
from
the
lawyer
point
of
view
but
it
certainly
is
from
the
gentleman
and
it
is
only
by
the
plea
that
its
inequalities
give
society
a
gentleman
that
our
present
social
system
can
claim
to
endure
i
would
like
to
accentuate
that
because
if
we
are
to
emerge
again
from
these
acute
social
dissensions
a
reunited
and
powerful
people
there
has
to
be
a
change
of
tone
a
new
generosity
on
the
part
of
those
who
deal
with
labour
speeches
labour
literature
labour
representatives
and
labour
claims
labour
is
necessarily
at
an
enormous
disadvantage
in
discussion
in
spite
of
a
tremendous
inferiority
in
training
and
education
it
is
trying
to
tell
the
community
its
conception
of
its
needs
and
purposes
it
is
not
only
young
as
a
participator
in
the
discussion
of
affairs
it
is
actually
young
the
average
working
man
is
not
half
the
age
of
the
ripe
politicians
and
judges
and
lawyers
and
wealthy
organisers
who
trip
him
up
legally
accuse
him
of
bad
faith
mark
his
every
inconsistency
it
is
becoming
so
to
use
our
forensic
advantages
it
is
if
that
has
no
appeal
to
you
wise
the
thing
our
society
has
most
to
fear
from
labour
is
not
organised
resistance
not
victorious
strikes
and
raised
conditions
but
the
black
resentment
that
follows
defeat
meet
labour
and
you
will
find
a
new
in
government
stick
to
your
legal
rights
draw
the
net
of
repressive
legislation
tighter
then
you
will
presently
have
to
deal
with
labour
enraged
if
the
anger
burns
free
that
means
revolution
if
you
crush
out
the
hope
of
that
then
sabotage
and
a
sullen
general
sympathy
for
anarchistic
crime
sec
in
the
preceding
pages
i
have
discussed
certain
aspects
of
the
present
labour
situation
i
have
tried
to
show
the
profound
significance
in
this
discussion
of
the
distrust
which
has
grown
up
in
the
minds
of
the
workers
and
how
this
distrust
is
being
exacerbated
by
our
entirely
too
forensic
method
of
treating
their
claims
i
want
now
to
point
out
a
still
more
powerful
set
of
influences
which
is
steadily
turning
our
labour
struggles
from
mere
attempts
to
adjust
hours
and
wages
into
movements
that
are
gravely
and
deliberately
revolutionary
this
is
the
obvious
devotion
of
a
large
and
growing
proportion
of
the
time
and
energy
of
the
owning
and
ruling
classes
to
pleasure
and
excitement
and
the
way
in
which
this
spectacle
of
amusement
and
adventure
is
now
being
brought
before
the
eyes
and
into
the
imagination
of
the
working
man
the
intimate
psychology
of
work
is
a
thing
altogether
too
little
considered
and
discussed
one
asks
what
keeps
a
workman
working
properly
at
his
work
and
it
seems
a
sufficient
answer
to
say
that
it
is
the
need
of
getting
a
living
but
that
is
not
the
complete
answer
work
must
to
some
extent
interest
if
it
bores
no
power
on
earth
will
keep
a
man
doing
it
properly
and
the
tendency
of
modern
industrialism
has
been
to
subdivide
processes
and
make
work
more
boring
and
irksome
also
the
workman
must
be
satisfied
with
the
living
he
is
getting
and
the
tendency
of
newspaper
theatre
cinematograph
show
and
so
forth
is
to
fill
his
mind
with
ideas
of
ways
of
living
infinitely
more
agreeable
and
interesting
than
his
own
habit
also
counts
very
largely
in
the
regular
return
of
the
man
to
his
job
and
the
fluctuations
of
employment
the
failure
of
the
employing
class
to
provide
any
alternative
to
idleness
during
slack
time
break
that
habit
of
industry
and
then
last
but
not
least
there
is
men
and
women
are
capable
of
wonders
of
and
effort
if
they
feel
that
theirs
is
a
meritorious
service
if
they
imagine
the
thing
they
are
doing
is
the
thing
they
ought
to
do
a
miner
will
cut
coal
in
a
different
spirit
and
with
a
fading
zest
if
he
knows
his
day
output
is
to
be
burnt
to
waste
secretly
by
a
lunatic
man
is
a
social
animal
few
men
are
naturally
social
rebels
and
most
will
toil
very
cheerfully
in
subordination
if
they
feel
that
the
collective
end
is
a
fine
thing
and
a
great
thing
now
this
force
of
is
much
more
acutely
present
in
the
mind
of
the
modern
worker
than
it
was
in
the
thought
of
his
fathers
he
is
intellectually
more
active
than
his
predecessors
his
imagination
is
relatively
stimulated
he
asks
wide
questions
the
worker
of
a
former
generation
took
himself
for
granted
it
is
a
new
phase
when
the
toilers
begin
to
ask
not
one
man
here
or
there
but
in
masses
in
battalions
in
trades
why
then
are
toilers
and
for
what
is
it
that
we
toil
what
answer
do
we
give
them
i
ask
the
reader
to
put
himself
in
the
place
of
a
good
workman
a
young
capable
miner
let
us
say
in
search
of
an
answer
to
that
question
he
is
we
will
suppose
temporarily
unemployed
through
the
production
of
a
glut
of
coal
and
he
goes
about
the
world
trying
to
see
the
fine
and
noble
collective
achievements
that
justify
the
devotion
of
his
whole
life
to
humble
toil
i
ask
the
reader
what
have
we
got
to
show
that
man
what
are
we
doing
up
in
the
light
and
air
that
justifies
our
demand
that
he
should
go
on
hewing
in
narrow
seams
and
cramped
corners
until
he
can
hew
no
more
where
is
he
to
be
taken
to
see
these
crowning
fruits
of
our
release
from
toil
shall
we
take
him
to
the
house
of
commons
to
note
which
of
the
barristers
is
making
most
headway
over
welsh
disestablishment
or
shall
we
take
him
to
the
inquiry
to
hear
the
latest
about
those
children
out
of
who
were
drowned
shall
we
give
him
an
hour
or
so
among
the
portraits
at
the
royal
academy
or
shall
we
make
an
enthusiastic
tour
of
london
sculpture
and
architecture
and
saturate
his
soul
with
the
beauty
he
makes
possible
the
new
automobile
club
for
example
without
you
and
your
subordination
we
could
not
have
had
that
or
suppose
we
took
him
the
round
of
the
clubs
and
restaurants
and
made
him
estimate
how
many
dinners
london
can
produce
at
a
pinch
at
the
price
of
his
local
daily
minimum
say
and
upward
or
borrow
an
aeroplane
at
hendon
and
soar
about
counting
all
the
golfers
in
the
home
counties
on
any
afternoon
you
suffer
at
the
roots
of
things
far
below
there
but
see
all
this
nobility
and
splendour
these
sweet
bright
flowers
to
which
your
rootlet
life
contributes
or
we
might
spend
a
pleasant
morning
trying
to
get
a
passable
woman
hat
for
the
price
of
his
average
weekly
wages
in
some
shop
but
indeed
this
thing
is
actually
happening
the
older
type
of
miner
was
illiterate
incurious
he
read
nothing
lived
his
own
life
and
if
he
had
any
intellectual
and
spiritual
urgencies
in
him
beyond
eating
and
drinking
and
the

away
from
any

criticism
the
new
generation
of
miners
is
on
an
altogether
different
basis
it
is
at
once
less
brutal
and
less
spiritual
it
is
alert
informed
sceptical
and
the
press
with
photographic
illustrations
the
cinema
and
a
score
of
collateral
forces
are
giving
it
precisely
that
spectacular
view
of
luxury
amusement
aimlessness
and
excitement
taunting
it
with
just
that
suggestion
that
it
is
for
that
and
that
alone
that
the

and
the

and
the
folly
can
not
you

how
it
is
that
these
young
men
down
there
in
the
hot
and
dangerous
and
toilsome
and
inglorious
places
of
life
are
beginning
to
cry
out
we
are
being
made
fools
of
and
to
fling
down
their
tools
and
can
not
you
see
how
futile
it
is
to
dream
that
asquith
or
some
other
politician
by
some
trick
of
a
conciliation
act
or
some
claptrap
of
compulsory
arbitration
or
that
any
belated
suppression
of
discussion
and
strike
organisations
by
the
law
will
avert
this
gathering
storm
the
spectacle
of
pleasure
the
parade
of
clothes
estates
luxury
and
vanity
in
the
sight
of
the
workers
is
the
culminating
irritant
of
labour
so
long
as
that
goes
on
this
sombre
resolve
to
which
we
are
all
awakening
this
sombre
resolve
rather
to
wreck
the
whole
fabric
than
to
continue
patiently
at
work
will
gather
strength
it
does
not
matter
that
such
a
resolve
is
hopeless
and
unseasonable
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
profounder
impulses
that
underlie
reason
crush
this
resentment
it
will
recur
with
accumulated
strength
it
does
not
matter
that
there
is
no
plan
in
existence
for
any
kind
of
social
order
that
could
be
set
up
in
the
place
of
our
present
system
no
plan
that
is
that
will
endure
half
an
hour
practical
criticism
the
cardinal
fact
before
us
is
that
the
workers
do
not
intend
to
stand
things
as
they
are
and
that
no
clever
arguments
no
expert
handling
of
legal
points
no
ingenious
appearances
of
concession
will
stay
that
progressive
embitterment
but
i
think
i
have
said
enough
to
express
and
perhaps
convey
my
conviction
that
our
present
labour
troubles
are
unprecedented
and
that
they
mean
the
end
of
an
epoch
the
supply
of
cheap
labour
upon
which
the
fabric
of
our
contemporary
ease
and
comfort
is
erected
is
giving
out
the
spread
of
information
and
the
means
of
presentation
in
every
class
and
the
increase
of
luxury
and
in
the
prosperous
classes
are
the
chief
cause
of
that
in
the
place
of
that
old
convenient
labour
comes
a
new
sort
of
labour
reluctant
resentful
critical
and
suspicious
the
replacement
has
already
gone
so
far
that
i
am
certain
that
attempts
to
baffle
and
coerce
the
workers
back
to
their
old
conditions
must
inevitably
lead
to
a
series
of
increasingly
destructive
outbreaks
to
stresses
and
disorder
culminating
in
revolution
it
is
useless
to
dream
of
going
on
now
for
much
longer
upon
the
old
lines
our
civilisation
if
it
is
not
to
enter
upon
a
phase
of
conflict
and
decay
must
begin
to
adapt
itself
to
the
new
conditions
of
which
the
first
and
foremost
is
that
the
labouring
class
as
a
distinctive
class
consenting
to
a
distinctive
treatment
and
accepting
life
at
a
disadvantage
is
going
to
disappear
whether
we
do
it
soon
as
the
result
of
our
reflections
upon
the
present
situation
or
whether
we
do
it
presently
through
the
impoverishment
that
must
necessarily
result
from
a
lengthening
period
of
industrial
unrest
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
we
are
going
to
curtail
very
considerably
the
current
extravagance
of
the
spending
and
directing
classes
upon
food
clothing
display
and
all
the
luxuries
of
life
the
phase
of
affluence
is
over
and
unless
we
are
to
be
the
mere
passive
spectators
of
an
unprecedented
reduction
of
our
lives
all
of
us
who
have
leisure
and
opportunity
have
to
set
ourselves
very
strenuously
to
the
problem
not
of
reconciling
ourselves
to
the
for
that
possibility
is
over
but
of
establishing
a
new
method
of
with
those
who
seem
to
be
definitely
decided
not
to
remain
for
very
much
longer
we
have
as
sensible
people
to
realise
that
the
old
arrangement
which
has
given
us
of
the
fortunate
minority
so
much
leisure
luxury
and
abundance
advantages
we
have
as
a
class
put
to
so
vulgar
and
unprofitable
a
use
is
breaking
down
and
that
we
have
to
discover
a
new
more
equable
way
of
getting
the
world
work
done
certain
things
stand
out
pretty
obviously
it
is
clear
that
in
the
times
ahead
of
us
there
must
be
more
economy
in
giving
trouble
and
causing
work
a
greater
willingness
to
do
work
for
ourselves
a
great
economy
of
labour
through
machinery
and
skilful
management
so
much
is
unavoidable
if
we
are
to
meet
these
enlarged
requirements
upon
which
the
insurgent
worker
insists
if
we
who
have
at
least
some
experience
of
affairs
who
own
property
manage
businesses
and
discuss
and
influence
public
organisation
if
we
are
not
prepared
to
undertake
this
work
of
discipline
and
adaptation
for
ourselves
then
a
time
is
not
far
distant
when
insurrectionary
leaders
calling
themselves
socialists
or
syndicalists
or
what
not
men
with
none
of
our
experience
little
of
our
knowledge
and
far
less
hope
of
success
will
take
that
task
out
of
our
hands
footnote
larkinism
comes
to
endorse
me
since
this
was
written
we
have
in
fact
to
pull
ourselves
together
as
the
phrase
goes
and
make
an
end
to
all
this
slack
extravagant
living
this
spectacle
of
pleasure
that
has
been
spreading
and
intensifying
in
every
civilised
community
for
the
last
three
or
four
decades
what
is
happening
to
labour
is
indeed
from
one
point
of
view
little
else
than
the
correlative
of
what
has
been
happening
to
the
more
prosperous
classes
in
the
community
they
have
lost
their
their
gravity
their
sense
of
high
aims
they
have
become
the
victims
of
their
advantages
and
labour
grown
observant
and
intelligent
has
discovered
itself
and
declares
itself
no
longer
subordinate
just
what
powers
of
recovery
and
reconstruction
our
system
may
have
under
these
circumstances
the
decades
immediately
before
us
will
show
sec
let
us
try
to
anticipate
some
of
the
social
developments
that
are
likely
to
spring
out
of
the
present
labour
situation
it
is
quite
conceivable
of
course
that
what
lies
before
us
is
not
development
but
disorder
given
sufficient
suspicion
on
one
side
and
sufficient
obstinacy
and
trickery
on
the
other
it
may
be
impossible
to
restore
social
peace
in
any
form
and
industrialism
may
degenerate
into
a
wasteful
and
incurable
conflict
but
that
distressful
possibility
is
the
worst
and
perhaps
the
least
probable
of
many
it
is
much
more
acceptable
to
suppose
that
our
social
order
will
be
able
to
adjust
itself
to
the
new
outlook
and
temper
and
quality
of
the
labour
stratum
that
elementary
education
a
press
very
cheap
and
free
and
a
period
of
great
general
affluence
have
brought
about
one
almost
inevitable
feature
of
any
such
adaptation
will
be
a
changed
spirit
in
the
general
body
of
society
we
have
come
to
a
serious
condition
of
our
affairs
and
we
shall
not
get
them
into
order
again
without
a
thorough
of
ourselves
in
the
process
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
for
a
large
portion
of
our
comfortable
classes
existence
has
been
altogether
too
easy
for
the
last
lifetime
or
so
the
great
bulk
of
the
world
work
has
been
done
out
of
their
sight
and
knowledge
it
has
seemed
unnecessary
to
trouble
much
about
the
general
conduct
of
things
unnecessary
as
they
say
to
take
life
too
seriously
this
has
not
made
them
so
much
vicious
as
slack
lazy
and
there
has
been
an
elaboration
of
trivial
things
and
a
neglect
of
troublesome
and
important
things
the
one
grave
shock
of
the
boer
war
has
long
been
explained
and
sentimentalised
away
but
it
will
not
be
so
easy
to
explain
away
a
dislocated
train
service
and
an
empty
coal
cellar
as
it
was
to
get
a
favourable
interpretation
upon
some
demonstration
of
national
incompetence
half
the
world
away
it
is
indeed
no
disaster
but
a
matter
for
sincere
congratulation
that
the
british
prosperous
and
the
british
successful
to
whom
warning
after
warning
has
rained
in
vain
from
the
days
of
ruskin
carlyle
matthew
arnold
should
be
called
to
account
at
last
in
their
own
household
they
will
grumble
they
will
be
very
angry
but
in
the
end
i
believe
they
will
rise
to
the
opportunities
of
their
inconvenience
they
will
shake
off
their
intellectual
lassitude
take
over
again
the
public
and
private
affairs
they
have
come
to
leave
so
largely
in
the
hands
of
the
political
barrister
and
the
family
solicitor
become
keen
and
critical
and
constructive
bring
themselves
up
to
date
again
that
is
not
of
course
inevitable
but
i
am
taking
now
the
more
hopeful
view
and
then
what
sort
of
working
arrangements
are
our
renascent
owning
and
directing
classes
likely
to
make
with
the
new
labouring
class
how
is
the
work
going
to
be
done
in
the
harder
cleaner
more
equalised
and
better
managed
state
that
in
one
hopeful
mood
one
sees
ahead
of
us
now
after
the
experiences
of
the
past
twelve
months
it
is
obvious
that
the
days
when
most
of
the
directed
and
inferior
work
of
the
community
will
be
done
by
intermittently
employed
and
impecunious
is
drawing
to
an
end
a
large
part
of
the
task
of
reconstruction
ahead
of
us
will
consist
in
the
working
out
of
schemes
for
a
more
permanent
type
of
employment
and
for
a
direct
participation
of
the
worker
in
the
pride
profits
and
direction
of
the
work
such
schemes
admit
of
wide
variations
between
a
mere
bonus
system
a
periodic
tipping
of
the
employees
to
prevent
their
striking
and
a
real
and
honest
in
the
latter
case
a
great
enterprise
forced
to
consider
its
hands
as
being
also
in
their
degree
heads
would
include
a
department
of
technical
and
business
instruction
for
its
own
people
from
such
ideas
one
passes
very
readily
to
the
conception
of
businesses
in
which
the
factor
of
capital
would
no
longer
stand
out
as
an
element
distinct
from
and
contrasted
with
the
proprietorship
of
the
workers
one
sees
the
worker
as
an
active
and
intelligent
helper
during
the
great
portion
of
his
participation
and
as
an
annuitant
and
perhaps
if
he
has
devised
economies
and
improvements
a
receiver
of
royalties
during
his
declining
years
and
concurrently
with
the
systematic
reconstruction
of
a
large
portion
of
our
industries
upon
these
lines
there
will
have
to
be
a
vigorous
development
of
the
attempts
that
are
already
being
made
in
garden
cities
garden
suburbs
and
the
like
to
the
mass
of
our
population
in
a
more
civilised
and
more
agreeable
manner
probably
that
is
not
going
to
pay
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
business
man
but
we
prosperous
people
have
to
understand
that
there
are
things
more
important
and
more
profitable
than
and
we
have
to
tax
ourselves
not
merely
in
money
but
in
time
care
and
effort
in
the
matter
half
the
money
that
goes
out
of
england
to
switzerland
and
the
riviera
ought
to
go
to
the
extremely
amusing
business
of
clearing
up
ugly
corners
and
building
jolly
and
convenient
workmen
cottages
even
if
we
do
it
at
a
loss
it
is
part
of
our
discharge
for
the
leisure
and
advantages
the
system
has
given
us
part
of
that
just
give
and
take
over
and
above
the
solicitor
and
and
conception
of
justice
upon
which
social
order
ultimately
rests
we
have
to
do
it
not
in
a
mood
of
patronage
but
in
a
mood
of
attentive
solicitude
if
not
on
high
grounds
then
on
low
grounds
our
class
has
to
set
to
work
and
make
those
other
classes
more
interested
and
comfortable
and
contented
it
is
what
we
are
for
it
is
quite
impossible
for
workmen
and
poor
people
generally
to
plan
estates
and
arrange
their
own
homes
they
are
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
the
wealthy
in
this
matter
there
is
not
a
slum
not
a
hovel
not
an
eyesore
upon
the
english
landscape
for
which
some
owner
is
not
ultimately
to
be
blamed
or
excused
and
the
less
we
leave
of
such
things
about
the
better
for
us
in
that
day
of
reckoning
between
class
and
class
which
now
draws
so
near
it
is
as
plain
now
as
the
way
from
calais
to
paris
that
if
the
owning
class
does
not
attend
to
these
amenities
the
mass
of
the
people
doing
its
best
to
manage
the
thing
through
the
politicians
presently
will
they
may
make
a
frightful
mess
of
it
but
that
will
never
bring
back
things
again
into
the
hands
that
hold
them
and
neglect
them
their
time
will
have
passed
for
ever
but
these
are
the
mere
opening
requirements
of
this
hope
of
mine
of
a
quickened
social
consciousness
among
the
more
fortunate
and
leisurely
section
of
the
community
i
believe
that
much
profounder
changes
in
the
conditions
of
labour
are
possible
than
those
i
have
suggested
i
am
beginning
to
suspect
that
scarcely
any
of
our
preconceptions
about
the
way
work
must
be
done
about
the
hours
of
work
and
the
habits
of
work
will
stand
an
exhaustive
scientific
analysis
it
is
at
least
conceivable
that
we
could
get
much
of
the
work
that
has
to
be
done
to
keep
our
community
going
in
far
more
and
ways
than
we
follow
at
the
present
time
so
far
scientific
men
have
done
scarcely
anything
to
estimate
under
what
conditions
a
man
works
best
does
most
work
works
more
happily
suppose
it
turns
out
to
be
the
case
that
a
man
always
following
one
occupation
throughout
his
lifetime
working
regularly
day
after
day
for
so
many
hours
as
most
do
at
the
present
time
does
not
do
nearly
so
much
or
nearly
so
well
as
he
would
do
if
he
followed
first
one
occupation
and
then
another
or
if
he
worked
as
hard
as
he
possibly
could
for
a
definite
period
and
then
took
holiday
i
suspect
very
strongly
indeed
i
am
convinced
that
in
certain
occupations
teaching
for
example
or
surgery
a
man
begins
by
working
clumsily
and
awkwardly
that
his
interest
and
skill
rise
rapidly
that
if
he
is
really
well
suited
in
his
profession
he
may
presently
become
intensely
interested
and
capable
of
enormous
quantities
of
his
very
best
work
and
that
then
his
interest
and
vigour
rapidly
decline
i
am
disposed
to
believe
that
this
is
true
of
most
occupations
of
or
engineering
or
or
the
thing
has
never
been
properly
thought
about
our
civilisation
has
grown
up
in
a
haphazard
kind
of
way
and
it
has
been
convenient
to
specialise
workers
and
employ
them
piecemeal
but
if
it
is
true
that
in
respect
of
any
occupation
a
man
has
his
period
of
maximum
efficiency
then
we
open
up
a
whole
world
of
new
social
possibilities
what
we
really
want
from
a
man
for
our
social
welfare
in
that
case
is
not
regular
continuing
work
but
a
few
strenuous
years
of
service
we
can
as
a
community
afford
to
keep
him
longer
at
education
and
training
before
he
begins
and
we
can
release
him
with
a
pension
while
he
is
still
full
of
life
and
the
capacity
for
enjoying
freedom
but
obviously
this
is
impossible
upon
any
basis
of
weekly
wages
and
intermittent
employment
we
must
be
handling
affairs
in
some
much
more
comprehensive
way
than
that
before
we
can
take
and
deal
with
the
working
life
of
a
man
as
one
complete
whole
that
is
one
possibility
that
is
frequently
in
my
thoughts
about
the
present
labour
crisis
there
is
another
and
that
is
the
great
desirability
of
every
class
in
the
community
having
a
practical
knowledge
of
what
labour
means
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
work
which
either
is
now
or
is
likely
to
be
in
the
future
within
the
domain
of
the
public
administration
mining
railway
work
and
telephone
work
medical
work
nursing
a
considerable
amount
of
building
for
example
why
should
we
employ
people
to
do
the
bulk
of
these
things
at
all
why
should
we
not
as
a
community
do
them
ourselves
why
in
other
words
should
we
not
have
a
labour
conscription
and
take
a
year
or
so
of
service
from
everyone
in
the
community
high
or
low
i
believe
this
would
be
of
enormous
moral
benefit
to
our
strained
and
relaxed
community
i
believe
that
in
making
labour
a
part
of
life
and
the
whole
of
nobody
life
lies
the
ultimate
solution
of
these
industrial
difficulties
sec
it
is
almost
a
national
boast
that
we
muddle
through
our
troubles
and
i
suppose
it
is
true
and
to
our
credit
that
by
virtue
of
a
certain
kindliness
of
temper
a
humorous
willingness
to
make
the
best
of
things
and
an
entirely
amiable
forgetfulness
we
do
come
out
of
pressures
and
extremities
that
would
smash
a
harder
more
brittle
people
only
a
little
chipped
and
damaged
and
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
our
country
will
in
a
measure
survive
the
enormous
stresses
of
labour
adjustment
that
are
now
upon
us
even
if
it
never
rises
to
any
heroic
struggle
against
these
difficulties
but
it
may
survive
as
a
lesser
country
as
an
impoverished
and
country
it
will
certainly
do
no
more
than
that
if
in
any
part
of
the
world
there
is
to
be
found
a
people
capable
of
taking
up
this
gigantic
question
in
a
greater
spirit
perhaps
there
is
no
such
people
and
the
conflicts
and
muddles
before
us
will
be
or
suppose
that
it
falls
to
our
country
in
some
strange
way
to
develop
a
new
courage
and
enterprise
and
to
be
the
first
to
go
forward
into
this
new
phase
of
civilisation
i
foresee
from
which
a
distinctive
labouring
class
a
class
that
is
of
expropriated
will
have
almost
completely
disappeared
now
hitherto
the
utmost
that
any
state
overtaken
by
social
and
economic
stresses
has
ever
achieved
in
the
way
of
adapting
itself
to
them
has
been
no
more
than
patching
individuals
and
groups
and
trades
have
found
themselves
in
imperfectly
apprehended
and
difficult
times
and
have
reluctantly
altered
their
ways
and
ideas
piecemeal
under
pressure
sometimes
they
have
succeeded
in
rubbing
along
upon
the
new
lines
and
sometimes
the
struggle
has
submerged
them
but
no
community
has
ever
yet
had
the
will
and
the
imagination
to
recast
and
radically
alter
its
social
methods
as
a
whole
the
idea
of
such
a
reconstruction
has
never
been
absent
from
human
thought
since
the
days
of
plato
and
it
has
been
enormously
reinforced
by
the
spreading
material
successes
of
modern
science
successes
due
always
to
the
substitution
of
analysis
and
reasoned
planning
for
trial
and
the
rule
of
thumb
but
it
has
never
yet
been
so
believed
in
and
understood
as
to
render
any
real
endeavour
to
reconstruct
possible
the
experiment
has
always
been
altogether
too
gigantic
for
the
available
faith
behind
it
and
there
have
been
against
it
the
fear
of
presumption
the
interests
of
all
advantaged
people
and
the
natural
sloth
of
humanity
we
do
but
emerge
now
from
a
period
of
deliberate
and
the
influence
of
herbert
spencer
who
came
near
raising
public
shiftlessness
to
the
dignity
of
a
national
philosophy
everything
would
adjust
itself
if
only
it
was
left
alone
yet
some
things
there
are
that
can
not
be
done
by
small
adjustments
such
as
leaping
chasms
or
killing
an
ox
or
escaping
from
the
roof
of
a
burning
house
you
have
to
decide
upon
a
certain
course
on
such
occasions
and
maintain
a
continuous
movement
if
you
wait
on
the
burning
house
until
you
scorch
and
then
turn
round
a
bit
or
move
away
a
yard
or
so
or
if
on
the
verge
of
a
chasm
you
move
a
little
in
the
way
in
which
you
wish
to
go
disaster
will
punish
your
moderation
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
establishment
of
the
world
work
upon
a
new
basis
and
that
and
no
less
is
what
this
labour
unrest
demands
for
its
pacification
is
just
one
of
those
large
alterations
which
will
never
be
made
by
the
collectively
unconscious
activities
of
men
by
competitions
and
survival
and
the
higgling
of
the
market
humanity
is
rebelling
against
the
continuing
existence
of
a
labour
class
as
such
and
i
can
see
no
way
by
which
our
present
method
of
weekly
wages
employment
can
change
by
imperceptible
increments
into
a
method
of
salary
and
pension
for
it
is
quite
evident
that
only
by
reaching
that
shall
we
reach
the
end
of
these
present
discontents
the
change
has
to
be
made
on
a
comprehensive
scale
or
not
at
all
we
need
nothing
less
than
a
national
plan
of
social
development
if
the
thing
is
to
be
achieved
now
that
i
admit
is
as
the
americans
say
a
large
proposition
but
we
are
living
in
a
time
of
more
and
more
comprehensive
plans
and
the
mere
fact
that
no
scheme
so
extensive
has
ever
been
tried
before
is
no
reason
at
all
why
we
should
not
consider
one
we
think
nowadays
quite
serenely
of
schemes
for
the
treatment
of
the
nation
health
as
one
whole
where
our
fathers
considered
illness
as
a
blend
of
accident
with
special
providences
we
have
systematised
the
community
water
supply
education
and
all
sorts
of
once
chaotic
services
and
germany
and
our
own
infinite
discomfort
and
ugliness
have
brought
home
to
us
at
last
even
the
possibility
of
planning
the
extension
of
our
towns
and
cities
it
is
only
another
step
upward
in
scale
to
plan
out
new
more
tolerable
conditions
of
employment
for
every
sort
of
worker
and
to
organise
the
transition
from
our
present
disorder
the
essential
difficulty
between
the
employer
and
the
statesman
in
the
consideration
of
this
problem
is
the
difference
in
the
scope
of
their
view
the
employer
concern
with
the
man
who
does
his
work
is
or
the
statesman
is
the
conditions
of
private
enterprise
and
modern
competition
oblige
the
employer
to
think
only
of
the
worker
as
a
hand
who
appears
and
does
his
work
and
draws
his
wages
and
vanishes
again
only
such
strikes
as
we
have
had
during
the
past
year
will
rouse
him
from
that
attitude
of
mind
the
statesman
at
the
other
extremity
has
to
consider
the
worker
as
a
being
with
a
beginning
a
middle
an
end
and
offspring
he
can
consider
all
these
possibilities
of
deferring
employment
and
making
the
toil
of
one
period
of
life
provide
for
the
leisure
and
freedom
of
another
which
are
necessarily
entirely
out
of
the
purview
of
an
employer
pure
and
simple
and
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
we
can
reconcile
the
intermittency
of
competitive
employment
with
the
unremitting
demands
of
a
civilised
life
except
by
the
intervention
of
the
state
or
of
some
public
organisation
capable
of
taking
very
wide
views
between
the
business
organiser
on
the
one
hand
and
the
subordinate
worker
on
the
other
on
the
one
hand
we
need
some
broader
handling
of
business
than
is
possible
in
the
private
adventure
of
the
solitary
proprietor
or
the
single
company
and
on
the
other
some
more
completely
organised
development
of
the
collective
bargain
we
have
to
bring
the
directive
intelligence
of
a
concern
into
an
organic
relation
with
the
conception
of
the
national
output
as
a
whole
and
either
through
a
trade
union
or
a
guild
or
some
expansion
of
a
trade
union
we
have
to
arrange
a
secure
continuous
income
for
the
worker
to
be
received
not
directly
as
wages
from
an
employer
but
intermediately
through
the
organisation
we
need
a
census
of
our
national
production
a
more
exhaustive
estimate
of
our
resources
and
an
entirely
more
scientific
knowledge
of
the
conditions
of
maximum
labour
efficiency
one
turns
to
the
state
and
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
heart
of
the
patriotic
englishman
sinks
because
it
is
our
national
misfortune
that
all
the
accidents
of
public
life
have
conspired
to
retard
the
development
of
just
that
body
of
knowledge
just
that
scientific
breadth
of
imagination
which
is
becoming
a
vital
necessity
for
the
welfare
of
a
modern
civilised
community
we
are
caught
short
of
scientific
men
just
as
in
the
event
of
a
war
with
germany
we
shall
almost
certainly
be
caught
short
of
scientific
sailors
and
soldiers
you
can
not
make
that
sort
of
thing
to
order
in
a
crisis
scientific
education
and
more
particularly
the
scientific
education
of
our
owning
and
responsible
classes
has
been
crippled
by
the
bitter
jealousy
of
the
classical
teachers
who
dominate
our
universities
by
the
fear
and
hatred
of
the
established
church
which
still
so
largely
controls
our
schools
and
by
the
entire
lack
of
understanding
and
support
on
the
part
of
those
able
barristers
and
financiers
who
rule
our
political
life
science
has
been
left
more
and
more
to
men
of
modest
origin
and
narrow
outlook
and
now
we
are
beginning
to
pay
in
internal
dissensions
and
presently
we
may
have
to
pay
in
national
humiliation
for
this
almost
organised
rejection
of
stimulus
and
power
but
however
thwarted
and
crippled
our
public
imagination
may
be
we
have
still
got
to
do
the
best
we
can
with
this
situation
we
have
to
take
as
comprehensive
views
as
we
can
and
to
attempt
as
comprehensive
a
method
of
handling
as
our
state
permits
in
theory
i
am
a
socialist
and
were
i
theorising
about
some
nation
in
the
air
i
would
say
that
all
the
great
productive
activities
and
all
the
means
of
communication
should
be
national
concerns
and
be
run
as
national
services
but
our
state
is
peculiarly
incapable
of
such
functions
at
the
present
time
it
can
not
even
produce
a
postage
stamp
that
will
stick
and
the
type
of
official
it
would
probably
evolve
for
industrial
organisation
slowly
but
unsurely
would
be
a
maddening
combination
of
the
district
visitor
and
the
boy
clerk
it
is
to
the
independent
people
of
some
leisure
and
resource
in
the
community
that
one
has
at
last
to
appeal
for
such
large
efforts
and
understandings
as
our
present
situation
demands
in
the
default
of
our
public
services
there
opens
an
immense
opportunity
for
voluntary
effort
deference
to
our
official
leaders
is
absurd
it
is
a
time
when
men
must
as
the
phrase
goes
come
forward
we
want
a
national
plan
for
our
social
and
economic
development
which
everyone
may
understand
and
which
will
serve
as
a
unifying
basis
for
all
our
social
and
political
activities
such
a
plan
is
not
to
be
flung
out
hastily
by
an
irresponsible
writer
it
can
only
come
into
existence
as
the
outcome
of
a
wide
movement
of
inquiry
and
discussion
my
business
in
these
pages
has
been
not
prescription
but
diagnosis
i
hold
it
to
be
the
clear
duty
of
every
intelligent
person
in
the
country
to
do
his
utmost
to
learn
about
these
questions
of
economic
and
social
organisation
and
to
work
them
out
to
conclusions
and
a
purpose
we
have
come
to
a
phase
in
our
affairs
when
the
only
alternative
to
a
great
deliberate
renascence
of
will
and
understanding
is
national
disorder
and
decay
sec
i
have
attempted
a
diagnosis
of
this
aspect
of
our
national
situation
i
have
pointed
out
that
nearly
all
the
social
forces
of
our
time
seem
to
be
in
conspiracy
to
bring
about
the
disappearance
of
a
labour
class
as
such
and
the
rearrangement
of
our
work
and
industry
upon
a
new
basis
that
rearrangement
demands
an
unprecedented
national
effort
and
the
production
of
an
adequate
national
plan
failing
that
we
seem
doomed
to
a
period
of
chronic
social
conflict
and
possibly
even
of
frankly
revolutionary
outbreaks
that
may
destroy
us
altogether
or
leave
us
only
a
dwarfed
and
enfeebled
nation
and
before
we
can
develop
that
national
plan
and
the
effective
realisation
of
such
a
plan
that
is
needed
to
save
us
from
that
fate
two
things
stand
immediately
before
us
to
be
done
unavoidable
preliminaries
to
that
more
comprehensive
work
the
first
of
these
is
the
restoration
of
representative
government
and
the
second
a
renascence
of
our
public
thought
about
political
and
social
things
as
i
have
already
suggested
a
main
factor
in
our
present
national
inability
to
deal
with
this
profound
and
increasing
social
disturbance
is
the
entirely
unrepresentative
and
unbusinesslike
nature
of
our
parliamentary
government
it
is
to
a
quite
extraordinary
extent
a
thing
apart
from
our
national
life
it
becomes
more
and
more
so
to
go
into
the
house
of
commons
is
to
go
aside
out
of
the
general
stream
of
the
community
vitality
into
a
corner
where
little
is
learnt
and
much
is
concocted
into
a
specialised
assembly
which
is
at
once
inattentive
to
and
monstrously
influential
in
our
affairs
there
was
a
period
when
the
debates
in
the
house
of
commons
were
an
integral
almost
a
dominant
part
of
our
national
thought
when
its
speeches
were
read
over
in
tens
of
thousands
of
homes
and
a
large
and
sympathetic
public
followed
the
details
of
every
contested
issue
now
a
newspaper
that
dared
to
fill
its
columns
mainly
with
parliamentary
debates
with
a
full
report
of
the
trivialities
the
academic
points
the
little
familiar
jokes
and
entirely
insincere
pleadings
which
occupy
that
gathering
would
court
bankruptcy
this
diminishing
actuality
of
our
political
life
is
a
matter
of
almost
universal
comment
but
it
is
extraordinary
how
much
of
that
comment
is
made
in
a
tone
of
hopeless
dissatisfaction
how
rarely
it
is
associated
with
any
will
to
change
a
state
of
affairs
that
so
largely
stultifies
our
national
purpose
and
yet
the
causes
of
our
present
political
ineptitude
are
fairly
manifest
and
a
radical
and
effective
reconstruction
is
well
within
the
wit
of
man
all
causes
and
all
effects
in
our
complex
modern
state
are
complex
but
in
this
particular
matter
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
key
to
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
crudity
and
simplicity
of
our
method
of
election
a
method
which
reduces
our
apparent
free
choice
of
rulers
to
a
ridiculous
selection
between
undesirable
alternatives
and
hands
our
whole
public
life
over
to
the
specialised
manipulator
our
house
of
commons
could
scarcely
misrepresent
us
more
if
it
was
appointed
haphazard
by
the
lord
chamberlain
or
selected
by
lot
from
among
the
inhabitants
of
netting
hill
election
of
representatives
in
local
constituencies
by
a
single
vote
gives
a
citizen
practically
no
choice
beyond
the
candidates
appointed
by
the
two
great
party
organisations
in
the
state
it
is
an
electoral
system
that
forbids
absolutely
any
vote
splitting
or
any
indication
of
shades
of
opinion
the
presence
of
more
than
two
candidates
introduces
an
altogether
unmanageable
complication
and
the
voter
is
at
once
reduced
to
voting
not
to
secure
the
return
of
the
perhaps
less
hopeful
candidate
he
likes
but
to
ensure
the
rejection
of
the
candidate
he
most
dislikes
so
the
nimble
slips
in
in
great
britain
we
do
not
have
elections
any
more
we
have
rejections
what
really
happens
at
a
general
election
is
that
the
party
organisations
obscure
and
secretive
conclaves
with
entirely
mysterious
funds
appoint
about
men
to
be
our
rulers
and
all
that
we
we
people
are
permitted
to
do
is
in
a
muddled
angry
way
to
strike
off
the
names
of
about
half
of
these
selected
gentlemen
take
almost
any
member
of
the
present
government
and
consider
his
case
you
may
credit
him
with
a
lifelong
industrious
intention
to
get
there
but
ask
yourself
what
is
this
man
distinction
and
for
what
great
thing
in
our
national
life
does
he
stand
by
the
complaisance
of
our
party
machinery
he
was
able
to
present
himself
to
a
perplexed
constituency
as
the
only
possible
alternative
to
conservatism
and
tariff
reform
and
so
we
have
him
and
so
we
have
most
of
his
colleagues
now
such
a
system
of
representation
is
surely
a
system
to
be
destroyed
at
any
cost
because
it
stifles
our
national
discussion
and
thwarts
our
national
will
and
we
can
leave
no
possible
method
of
alteration
untried
it
is
not
rational
that
a
great
people
should
be
baffled
by
the
mere
mechanical
degeneration
of
an
electoral
method
too
crudely
conceived
there
exist
alternatives
and
to
these
alternatives
we
must
resort
since
john
stuart
mill
first
called
attention
to
the
importance
of
the
matter
there
has
been
a
systematic
study
of
the
possible
working
of
electoral
methods
and
it
is
now
fairly
proved
that
in
proportional
representation
with
large
constituencies
returning
each
many
members
there
is
to
be
found
a
way
of
escape
from
this
disastrous
embarrassment
of
our
public
business
by
the
party
and
the
party
nominee
i
will
not
dwell
upon
the
particulars
of
the
proportional
representation
system
here
there
exists
an
active
society
which
has
organised
the
education
of
the
public
in
the
details
of
the
proposal
suffice
it
that
it
does
give
a
method
by
which
a
voter
may
vote
with
confidence
for
the
particular
man
he
prefers
with
no
fear
whatever
that
his
vote
will
be
wasted
in
the
event
of
that
man
chance
being
hopeless
there
is
a
method
by
which
the
order
of
the
voter
subsequent
preference
is
effectively
indicated
that
is
all
but
see
how
completely
it
modifies
the
nature
of
an
election
instead
of
a
hampered
choice
between
two
you
have
a
free
choice
between
many
such
a
change
means
a
complete
alteration
in
the
quality
of
public
life
the
present
immense
advantage
of
the
party
nominee
which
is
the
root
cause
which
is
almost
the
sole
cause
of
all
our
present
political
ineptitude
would
disappear
he
would
be
quite
unable
to
oust
any
and
representative
independent
candidate
who
chose
to
stand
against
him
there
would
be
an
immediate
alteration
in
type
in
the
house
of
commons
in
the
place
of
these
specialists
in
political
there
would
be
few
men
who
had
not
already
gained
some
intellectual
and
moral
hold
upon
the
community
they
would
already
be
outstanding
and
distinguished
men
before
they
came
to
the
work
of
government
great
sections
of
our
national
life
science
art
literature
education
engineering
manufacture
would
cease
to
be
or
misrepresented
by
the
energetic
barrister
and
political
specialist
and
our
legislature
would
begin
to
serve
as
we
have
now
such
urgent
need
of
its
serving
as
the
means
and
instrument
of
that
national
conference
upon
the
social
outlook
of
which
we
stand
in
need
and
it
is
to
the
need
and
nature
of
that
conference
that
i
would
devote
myself
i
do
not
mean
by
the
word
conference
any
gathering
of
dull
and
formal
and
inattentive
people
in
this
dusty
hall
or
that
with
a
jaded
audience
and
intermittently
active
reporters
such
as
this
word
may
conjure
up
to
some
imaginations
i
mean
an
earnest
direction
of
attention
in
all
parts
of
the
country
to
this
necessity
for
a
studied
and
elaborated
project
of
conciliation
and
social
we
can
not
afford
to
leave
such
things
to
specialised
politicians
and
experts
any
longer
a
modern
community
has
to
think
out
its
problems
as
a
whole
and
as
a
whole
in
their
solution
we
have
to
bring
all
our
national
life
into
this
discussion
of
the
national
plan
before
us
and
not
simply
newspapers
and
periodicals
and
books
but
pulpit
and
college
and
school
have
to
bear
their
part
in
it
and
in
that
particular
i
would
appeal
to
the
schools
because
there
more
than
anywhere
else
is
the
permanent
quickening
of
our
national
imagination
to
be
achieved
we
want
to
have
our
young
people
filled
with
a
new
realisation
that
history
is
not
over
that
nothing
is
settled
and
that
the
supreme
dramatic
phase
in
the
story
of
england
has
still
to
come
it
was
not
in
the
norman
conquest
not
in
the
flight
of
king
james
ii
nor
the
overthrow
of
napoleon
it
is
here
and
now
it
falls
to
them
to
be
actors
not
in
a
reminiscent
pageant
but
a
living
conflict
and
the
sooner
they
are
prepared
to
take
their
part
in
that
the
better
our
empire
will
acquit
itself
how
absurd
is
the
preoccupation
of
our
schools
and
colleges
with
the
little
provincialisms
of
our
past
history
before
no
current
politics
whispers
the
schoolmaster
no
religion
except
the
coldest
formalities
parent
might
and
he
pours
into
our
country
every
year
a
fresh
supply
of
gentlemanly
cricketing
youths
gapingly
unprepared
unless
they
have
picked
up
a
broad
generalisation
or
so
from
some
surreptitious
socialist
pamphlet
for
the
immense
issues
they
must
control
and
that
are
altogether
uncontrollable
if
they
fail
to
control
them
the
universities
do
scarcely
more
for
our
young
men
all
this
has
to
be
altered
and
altered
vigorously
and
soon
if
our
country
is
to
accomplish
its
destinies
our
schools
and
colleges
exist
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
give
our
youths
a
vision
of
the
world
and
of
their
duties
and
possibilities
in
the
world
we
can
no
longer
afford
to
have
them
the
last
preserves
of
an
elderly
orthodoxy
and
the
last
repository
of
a
decaying
gift
of
superseded
tongues
they
are
needed
too
urgently
to
make
our
leaders
and
to
sustain
the
active
understandings
of
the
race
and
from
the
labour
class
itself
we
are
also
justified
in
demanding
a
far
more
effectual
contribution
to
the
national
conference
than
it
is
making
at
the
present
time
mere
eloquent
apologies
for
distrust
mere
denunciations
of
capitalism
and
appeals
for
a
socialism
as
featureless
as
smoke
are
unsatisfactory
when
one
regards
them
as
the
entire
contribution
of
the
ascendant
worker
to
the
discussion
of
the
national
future
the
labour
thinker
has
to
become
definite
in
his
demands
and
clearer
upon
the
give
and
take
that
will
be
necessary
before
they
can
be
satisfied
he
has
to
realise
rather
more
generously
than
he
has
done
so
far
the
enormous
moral
difficulty
there
is
in
bringing
people
who
have
been
prosperous
and
at
an
advantage
all
their
lives
to
the
pitch
of
even
contemplating
a
social
reorganisation
that
may
minimise
or
destroy
their
precedence
we
have
all
to
think
to
think
hard
and
think
generously
and
there
is
not
a
man
in
england
even
though
his
hands
are
busy
at
work
whose
brain
may
not
be
helping
in
this
great
task
of
social
rearrangement
which
lies
before
us
all
social
panaceas
to
have
followed
the
frequent
discussions
of
the
labour
unrest
in
the
press
is
to
have
learnt
quite
a
lot
about
the
methods
of
popular
thought
and
among
other
things
i
see
now
much
better
than
i
did
why
patent
medicines
are
so
popular
it
is
clear
that
as
a
community
we
are
far
too
impatient
of
detail
and
complexity
we
want
overmuch
to
simplify
we
clamour
for
panaceas
we
are
a
collective
invitation
to
quacks
our
situation
is
an
intricate
one
it
does
not
admit
of
a
solution
neatly
done
up
in
a
word
or
a
phrase
yet
so
powerful
is
this
wish
to
simplify
that
it
is
difficult
to
make
it
clear
that
one
is
not
oneself
a
one
writes
and
people
read
a
little
inattentively
and
more
than
a
little
impatiently
until
one
makes
a
positive
proposal
then
they
jump
so
your
remedy
they
say
how
absurdly
inadequate
i
was
privileged
to
take
part
in
one
such
discussion
in
and
among
other
things
in
my
diagnosis
of
the
situation
i
pointed
out
the
extreme
mischief
done
to
our
public
life
by
the
futility
of
our
electoral
methods
they
make
our
whole
public
life
forensic
and
ineffectual
and
i
pointed
out
that
this
evil
effect
which
vitiates
our
whole
national
life
could
be
largely
remedied
by
an
infinitely
better
voting
system
known
as
proportional
representation
thereupon
the
declared
in
tones
of
pity
and
contempt
that
it
was
no
remedy
and
dismissed
me
it
would
be
as
intelligent
to
charge
a
doctor
who
pushed
back
the
crowd
about
a
man
in
the
street
with
wanting
to
heal
the
limb
by
giving
the
sufferer
air
the
task
before
our
community
the
task
of
reorganising
labour
on
a
basis
broader
than
that
of
employment
for
daily
or
weekly
wages
is
one
of
huge
complexity
and
it
is
as
entirely
reasonable
as
it
is
entirely
preliminary
to
clean
and
modernise
to
the
utmost
our
representative
and
legislative
machinery
it
is
remarkable
how
dominant
is
this
disposition
to
get
a
phrase
a
word
a
simple
recipe
for
an
undertaking
so
vast
in
reality
that
for
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
a
large
part
of
the
activities
of
us
forty
million
people
will
be
devoted
to
its
partial
accomplishment
in
the
presence
of
very
great
issues
people
become
impatient
and
irritated
as
they
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
irritated
by
far
more
limited
problems
nobody
in
his
senses
expects
a
panacea
for
the
comparatively
simple
and
trivial
business
of
playing
chess
nobody
wants
to
be
told
to
rely
wholly
upon
your
pawns
or
never
never
move
your
rook
nobody
clamours
give
me
a
third
knight
and
all
will
be
well
but
that
is
exactly
what
everybody
seems
to
be
doing
in
our
present
discussion
and
as
another
aspect
of
the
same
impatience
i
note
the
disposition
to
clamour
against
all
sorts
of
necessary
processes
in
the
development
of
a
civilisation
for
example
i
read
over
and
over
again
of
the
failure
of
representative
government
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
i
find
that
this
amounts
to
a
cry
against
any
sort
of
representative
government
it
is
perfectly
true
that
our
representative
institutions
do
not
work
well
and
need
a
vigorous
overhauling
but
while
i
find
scarcely
any
support
for
such
a
revision
the
air
is
full
of
vague
dangerous
demands
for
aristocracy
for
oligarchy
for
autocracy
it
is
like
a
man
who
jumps
out
of
his
automobile
because
he
has
burst
a
tyre
refuses
a
proffered
stepney
and
bawls
passionately
for
anything
for
a
or
a
donkey
as
long
as
he
can
be
free
from
that
exploded
mechanism
there
are
evidently
quite
a
considerable
number
of
people
in
this
country
who
would
welcome
a
tyrant
at
the
present
time
a
strong
silent
cruel
imprisoning
executing
melodramatic
sort
of
person
who
would
somehow
manage
everything
while
they
went
on
being
silly
i
find
that
form
of
impatience
cropping
up
everywhere
i
hear
echoes
of
wanted
a
man
and
we
may
yet
see
a
general
boulanger
prancing
in
our
streets
there
never
was
a
more
foolish
cry
it
is
not
a
man
we
want
but
just
exactly
as
many
million
men
as
there
are
in
great
britain
at
the
present
time
and
it
is
you
the
reader
and
i
and
the
rest
of
us
who
must
together
go
on
with
the
perennial
task
of
saving
the
country
by
doing
our
own
jobs
just
as
well
as
ever
we
can
and
and
this
is
really
just
as
important
as
firstly
doing
our
utmost
to
grasp
our
national
purpose
doing
our
utmost
that
is
to
develop
and
carry
out
our
national
plan
it
is
everyman
who
must
be
the
saviour
of
the
state
in
a
modern
community
we
can
not
shift
our
share
in
the
burthen
and
here
again
i
think
is
something
that
may
well
be
underlined
and
emphasised
at
present
our
secondly
is
unduly
subordinated
to
our
firstly
our
game
is
better
individually
than
collectively
we
are
like
a
football
team
that
passes
badly
and
our
need
is
not
nearly
so
much
to
change
the
players
as
to
broaden
their
style
and
this
brings
me
in
a
spirit
entirely
antagonistic
up
against
galsworthy
suggestion
of
an
autocratic
revolution
in
the
methods
of
our
public
schools
but
before
i
go
on
to
that
let
me
first
notice
a
still
more
comprehensive
cry
that
has
been
heard
again
and
again
in
this
discussion
and
that
is
the
alleged
failure
of
education
generally
there
is
never
any
remedial
suggestion
made
with
this
particular
outcry
it
is
merely
a
gust
of
abuse
and
insult
for
schools
and
more
particularly
board
schools
carrying
with
it
a
implication
that
they
should
be
closed
and
then
the
contribution
concludes
now
there
is
no
outcry
at
the
present
time
more
unjust
or
except
for
the
wanted
a
man
clamour
more
foolish
no
doubt
our
educational
resources
like
most
other
things
fall
far
short
of
perfection
but
of
all
this
imperfection
the
elementary
schools
are
least
imperfect
and
i
would
almost
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
considering
the
badness
of
their
material
the
huge
clumsy
classes
they
have
to
deal
with
the
poorness
of
their
directive
administration
their
bad
pay
and
uncertain
outlook
the
elementary
teachers
of
this
country
are
amazingly
efficient
and
it
is
not
simply
that
they
are
good
under
their
existing
conditions
but
that
this
service
has
been
made
out
of
nothing
whatever
in
the
course
of
scarcely
forty
years
an
educational
system
to
cover
an
empire
is
not
a
thing
that
can
be
got
for
the
asking
it
is
not
even
to
be
got
for
the
paying
it
has
to
be
grown
and
in
the
beginning
it
is
bound
to
be
thin
ragged
forced
crammy
superficial
and
all
the
rest
of
it
as
reasonable
to
complain
that
the
children
born
last
year
were
immature
a
little
army
of
teachers
does
not
flash
into
being
at
the
passing
of
an
education
act
not
even
an
organisation
for
training
those
teachers
comes
to
anything
like
satisfactory
working
order
for
many
years
without
considering
the
delays
and
obstructions
that
have
been
caused
by
the
bickerings
and
bitterness
of
the
various
christian
churches
so
that
it
is
not
the
failure
of
elementary
education
we
have
really
to
consider
but
the
continuance
and
extension
of
its
already
almost
miraculous
results
and
when
it
comes
to
the
education
of
the
ruling
and
directing
classes
there
is
kindred
if
lesser
reason
for
tempering
zeal
with
patience
this
upper
portion
of
our
educational
organisation
needs
urgently
to
be
bettered
but
it
is
not
to
be
bettered
by
trying
to
find
an
archangel
who
will
better
it
dictatorially
for
the
good
of
our
souls
there
are
no
such
beings
to
relieve
us
of
our
collective
responsibility
it
is
clear
that
appointments
in
this
field
need
not
only
far
more
care
and
far
more
insistence
upon
creative
power
than
has
been
shown
in
the
past
but
for
the
rest
we
have
to
do
with
the
men
we
have
and
the
schools
we
have
we
can
not
have
an
educational
purge
if
only
because
we
have
not
the
new
men
waiting
here
again
the
need
is
not
impatience
not
revolution
but
a
sustained
and
penetrating
criticism
a
steadfast
continuous
urgency
towards
effort
and
reconstruction
and
efficiency
and
as
a
last
example
of
the
present
hysterical
disposition
to
scrap
things
before
they
have
been
fairly
tried
is
the
outcry
against
examinations
which
has
done
so
much
to
take
the
keenness
off
the
edge
of
school
work
in
the
last
few
years
because
a
great
number
of
examiners
chosen
haphazard
turned
out
to
be
negligent
and
incompetent
as
examiners
because
their
incapacity
created
a
cynical
trade
in
cramming
a
great
number
of
people
have
come
to
the
conclusion
just
as
examinations
are
being
improved
into
efficiency
that
all
examinations
are
bad
in
particular
that
excellent
method
of
bringing
new
blood
and
new
energy
into
the
public
services
and
breaking
up
official
gangs
and
cliques
the
competitive
examination
system
has
been
discredited
and
the
and
the
influential
person
are
back
again
tampering
with
a
steadily
increasing
proportion
of
appointments
but
i
have
written
enough
of
this
impatience
which
is
as
it
were
merely
the
passion
for
reconstruction
losing
its
head
and
defeating
its
own
ends
there
is
no
hope
for
us
outside
ourselves
no
violent
changes
no
napoleonic
saviours
can
carry
on
the
task
of
building
the
great
state
the
civilised
state
that
rises
out
of
our
disorders
that
is
for
us
to
do
all
of
us
and
each
one
of
us
we
have
to
think
clearly
and
study
and
consider
and
reconsider
our
ideas
about
public
things
to
the
very
utmost
of
our
possibilities
we
have
to
clarify
our
views
and
express
them
and
do
all
we
can
to
stir
up
thinking
and
effort
in
those
about
us
i
know
it
would
be
more
agreeable
for
all
of
us
if
we
could
have
some
small
remedy
for
all
the
troubles
of
the
state
and
take
it
and
go
on
just
as
we
are
going
now
but
indeed
to
say
a
word
for
that
idea
would
be
a
treason
we
are
the
state
and
there
is
no
other
way
to
make
it
better
than
to
give
it
the
service
of
our
lives
just
in
the
measure
of
the
aggregate
of
our
devotions
and
the
elaborated
and
criticised
sanity
of
our
public
proceedings
will
the
world
mend
i
gather
from
a
valuable
publication
called
secret
remedies
which
analyses
many
popular
cures
that
this
hasty
passion
for
simplicity
for
just
one
thing
that
will
settle
the
whole
trouble
can
carry
people
to
a
level
beyond
an
undivided
trust
in
something
warranted
in
a
bottle
they
are
ready
to
put
their
faith
in
what
amounts
to
practically
nothing
in
a
bottle
and
just
at
present
while
a
number
of
excellent
people
of
the
middle
class
think
that
only
a
man
is
wanted
and
all
will
be
well
with
us
there
is
a
considerable
wave
of
hopefulness
among
the
working
class
in
favour
of
a
weak
solution
of
nothing
which
is
offered
under
the
attractive
label
of
syndicalism
so
far
i
have
been
able
to
discuss
the
present
labour
situation
without
any
use
of
this
empty
word
but
when
one
finds
it
cropping
up
in
every
other
article
on
the
subject
it
becomes
advisable
to
point
out
what
syndicalism
is
not
and
incidentally
it
may
enable
me
to
make
clear
what
socialism
in
the
broader
sense
constructive
socialism
that
is
to
say
is
syndicalism
or
citizenship
is
a
railway
porter
a
railway
porter
first
and
a
man
afterwards
or
is
he
a
man
first
and
incidentally
a
railway
porter
that
is
the
issue
between
this
tawdrification
of
trade
unionism
which
is
called
syndicalism
and
the
ideals
of
that
great
state
that
great
commonweal
towards
which
the
constructive
forces
in
our
civilisation
tend
are
we
to
drift
on
to
a
disastrous
intensification
of
our
present
specialisation
of
labour
as
labour
or
are
we
to
set
to
work
steadfastly
upon
a
vast
social
reconstruction
which
will
close
this
widening
breach
and
rescue
our
community
from
its
present
dependence
upon
the
reluctant
and
presently
insurgent
toil
of
a
proletariat
regarded
as
a
project
of
social
development
syndicalism
is
ridiculous
regarded
as
an
illuminating
and
unintentionally
ironical
complement
to
the
implicit
theories
of
our
present
social
order
it
is
worthy
of
close
attention
the
dream
of
the
syndicalist
is
an
impossible
social
fragmentation
the
transport
service
is
to
be
a
democratic
republic
the
mines
are
to
be
a
democratic
republic
every
great
industry
is
to
be
a
democratic
republic
within
the
state
our
community
is
to
become
a
conflict
of
governments
of
workers
incapable
of
progressive
changes
of
method
or
of
extension
or
transmutation
of
function
the
whole
being
of
a
man
is
to
lie
within
his
industrial
specialisation
and
upon
lines
of
causation
not
made
clear
wages
are
to
go
on
rising
and
hours
of
work
are
to
go
on
falling
there
the
mind
halts
blinded
by
the
too
dazzling
vistas
of
an
unimaginative
millennium
and
the
way
to
this
one
gathers
is
by
striking
persistent
destructive
striking
until
it
comes
about
such
is
syndicalism
the
cheap
labour
panacea
to
which
the
more
passionate
and
less
intelligent
portion
of
the
younger
workers
impatient
of
the
large
constructive
developments
of
modern
socialism
drifts
steadily
it
is
the
direct
and
logical
reaction
to
our
present
economic
system
which
has
counted
our
workers
neither
as
souls
nor
as
heads
but
as
hands
they
are
beginning
to
accept
the
suggestions
of
that
method
it
is
the
culmination
in
aggression
of
that
at
first
entirely
protective
trade
unionism
which
the
individual
selfishness
and
collective
and
state
blindness
of
our
owning
and
directing
and
ruling
classes
forced
upon
the
working
man
at
first
trade
unionism
was
essentially
defensive
it
was
the
only
possible
defence
of
the
workers
who
were
being
steadily
pressed
over
the
margin
of
subsistence
it
was
a
nearly
involuntary
resistance
to
class
debasement
vernon
hartshorn
has
expressed
it
as
that
in
a
recent
article
but
his
paper
if
one
read
it
from
beginning
to
end
displayed
compactly
and
completely
the
unavoidable
psychological
development
of
the
specialised
labour
case
he
began
in
the
mildest
tones
with
those
now
respectable
words
a
guaranteed
minimum
of
wages
housing
and
so
forth
and
ended
with
a
very
clear
intimation
of
an
community
if
anything
is
certain
in
this
world
it
is
that
the
mass
of
the
community
will
not
rest
satisfied
with
these
guaranteed
minima
all
those
possible
legislative
increments
in
the
general
standard
of
living
are
not
going
to
diminish
the
labour
unrest
they
are
going
to
increase
it
a
starving
man
may
think
he
wants
nothing
in
the
world
but
bread
but
when
he
has
eaten
you
will
find
he
wants
all
sorts
of
things
beyond
hartshorn
assures
us
that
the
worker
is
not
out
for
a
theory
so
much
the
worse
for
the
worker
and
all
of
us
when
like
the
mere
hand
we
have
made
him
he
shows
himself
unable
to
define
or
even
forecast
his
ultimate
intentions
he
will
in
that
case
merely
clutch
and
the
obvious
immediate
next
objective
of
that
clutch
directly
its
imagination
passes
beyond
the
guaranteed
minima
phase
is
the
industry
as
a
whole
i
do
not
see
how
anyone
who
desires
the
continuing
development
of
civilisation
can
regard
a
trade
union
as
anything
but
a
necessary
evil
a
contrivance
an
arresting
and
delaying
organisation
begotten
by
just
that
class
separation
of
labour
which
in
the
commonweal
of
the
great
state
will
be
altogether
destroyed
it
leads
nowhither
it
is
a
shelter
hut
on
the
road
the
wider
movement
of
modern
civilisation
is
against
class
organisation
and
caste
feeling
these
are
forces
antagonistic
to
progress
continually
springing
up
and
endeavouring
to
stereotype
the
transitory
organisation
and
continually
being
defeated
of
all
the
solemn
imbecilities
one
hears
surely
the
most
foolish
is
this
that
we
are
in
an
age
of
specialisation
the
comparative
fruitfulness
and
hopefulness
of
our
social
order
in
comparison
with
any
other
social
system
lies
in
its
flat
contradiction
of
that
absurdity
our
medical
and
surgical
advances
for
example
are
almost
entirely
due
to
the
invasion
of
medical
research
by
the
chemist
our
naval
development
to
the
supersession
of
the
sailor
by
the
engineer
we
sweep
away
the
coachman
with
the
railway
beat
the
suburban
line
with
the
electric
tramway
and
attack
that
again
with
the
petrol
omnibus
oust
brick
and
stonework
in
substantial
fabrics
by
steel
frames
replace
the
skilled
maker
of
woodcuts
by
a
photographer
and
so
on
through
the
whole
range
of
our
activities
change
of
function
arrest
of
specialisation
by
innovations
in
method
and
appliance
progress
by
the
infringement
of
professional
boundaries
and
the
defiance
of
rule
these
are
the
commonplaces
of
our
time
the
trained
man
the
specialised
man
is
the
most
unfortunate
of
men
the
world
leaves
him
behind
and
he
has
lost
his
power
of
overtaking
it
versatility
alert
adaptability
these
are
our
urgent
needs
in
peace
and
war
alike
the
unimaginative
uninventive
man
is
a
burthen
and
a
retardation
as
he
never
was
before
in
the
world
history
the
modern
community
therefore
that
succeeds
most
rapidly
and
most
completely
in
converting
both
its
labourers
and
its
leisure
class
into
a
population
of
active
able
unhurried
educated
and
physically
people
will
be
inevitably
the
dominant
community
in
the
world
that
lies
on
the
face
of
things
about
us
a
man
who
can
not
see
that
must
be
blind
to
the
traffic
in
our
streets
syndicalism
is
not
a
plan
of
social
development
it
is
a
spirit
of
conflict
that
conflict
lies
ahead
of
us
the
open
war
of
strikes
or
if
the
forces
of
law
and
order
crush
that
down
then
sabotage
and
that
black
revolt
of
the
human
spirit
into
crime
which
we
speak
of
nowadays
as
anarchism
unless
we
can
discover
a
broad
and
promising
way
from
the
present
condition
of
things
to
nothing
less
than
the
complete
abolition
of
the
labour
class
that
i
know
sounds
a
vast
proposal
but
this
is
a
gigantic
business
altogether
and
we
can
do
nothing
with
it
unless
we
are
prepared
to
deal
with
large
ideas
if
paul
begins
to
totter
it
is
no
good
propping
it
up
with
half
a
dozen
and
small
palliatives
have
no
legitimate
place
at
all
in
this
discussion
our
generation
has
to
take
up
this
tremendous
necessity
of
a
social
reconstruction
in
a
great
way
its
broad
lines
have
to
be
thought
out
by
thousands
of
minds
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
have
put
the
stress
upon
our
need
of
discussion
of
a
wide
intellectual
and
moral
stimulation
of
a
stirring
up
in
our
schools
and
pulpits
and
upon
the
modernisation
and
clarification
of
what
should
be
the
deliberative
assembly
of
the
nation
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
anticipate
the
national
plan
that
must
emerge
from
so
vast
a
debate
but
certain
conclusions
i
feel
in
my
bones
will
stand
the
test
of
an
exhaustive
criticism
the
first
is
that
a
distinction
will
be
drawn
between
what
i
would
call
interesting
work
and
what
i
would
call
mere
labour
the
two
things
i
admit
pass
by
insensible
gradations
into
one
another
but
while
on
the
one
hand
such
work
as
being
a
master
gardener
and
growing
roses
or
a
master
cabinet
maker
and
making
fine
pieces
or
an
artist
of
almost
any
sort
or
a
story
writer
or
a
consulting
physician
or
a
scientific
investigator
or
a
keeper
of
wild
animals
or
a
forester
or
a
librarian
or
a
good
printer
or
many
sorts
of
engineer
is
work
that
will
always
find
men
of
a
certain
temperament
enthusiastically
glad
to
do
it
if
they
can
only
do
it
for
comfortable
pay
for
such
work
is
in
itself
there
is
on
the
other
hand
work
so
irksome
and
toilsome
such
as
coal
mining
or
being
a
private
soldier
during
a
peace
or
attending
upon
lunatics
or
stoking
or
doing
over
and
over
again
almost
mechanically
little
bits
of
a
modern
industrial
process
or
being
a
cash
desk
clerk
in
a
busy
shop
that
few
people
would
undertake
if
they
could
avoid
it
and
the
whole
strength
of
our
collective
intelligence
will
be
directed
first
to
reducing
the
amount
of
such
irksome
work
by
machinery
by
ingenuity
of
management
and
by
the
systematic
avoidance
of
giving
trouble
as
a
duty
and
then
to
so
distributing
the
residuum
of
it
that
it
will
become
the
whole
life
of
no
class
whatever
in
our
population
i
have
already
quoted
the
idea
of
professor
william
james
of
a
universal
conscription
for
such
irksome
labour
and
while
he
would
have
instituted
that
mainly
for
its
immense
moral
effect
upon
the
community
i
would
point
out
that
combined
with
a
nationalisation
of
transport
mining
and
so
forth
it
is
also
a
way
to
a
partial
solution
of
this
difficulty
of
mere
toil
and
the
mention
of
a
compulsory
period
of
labour
service
for
everyone
a
year
or
so
with
the
pickaxe
as
well
as
with
the
rifle
leads
me
to
another
idea
that
i
believe
will
stand
the
test
of
unlimited
criticism
and
that
is
a
total
condemnation
of
all
these
notions
that
are
now
so
prevalent
in
liberal
circles
under
existing
conditions
in
our
system
of
private
enterprise
and
competition
these
restrictions
are
no
doubt
necessary
to
save
a
large
portion
of
our
population
from
lives
of
continuous
toil
but
like
trade
unionism
they
are
a
necessity
of
our
present
conditions
and
not
a
way
to
a
better
social
state
if
we
rescue
ourselves
as
a
community
from
poverty
and
discomfort
we
must
take
care
not
to
fling
ourselves
into
something
far
more
infuriating
to
a
normal
human
being
and
that
is
boredom
the
prospect
of
a
carefully
inspected
sanitary
life
tethered
to
some
light
little
uninteresting
daily
job
six
or
eight
hours
of
it
seems
to
me
and
i
am
sure
i
write
here
for
most
normal
healthy
active
people
more
awful
than
hunger
and
death
it
is
far
more
in
the
quality
of
the
human
spirit
and
still
more
what
we
all
in
our
hearts
want
the
human
spirit
to
be
to
fling
itself
with
its
utmost
power
at
a
job
and
do
it
with
passion
for
my
own
part
if
i
was
sentenced
to
hew
a
thousand
tons
of
coal
i
should
want
to
get
at
it
at
once
and
work
furiously
at
it
with
the
shortest
intervals
for
rest
and
refreshment
and
an
occasional
night
holiday
until
i
hewed
my
way
out
and
if
some
interfering
person
with
a
benevolent
air
wanted
to
restrict
me
to
hewing
five
hundredweight
and
no
more
and
no
less
each
day
and
every
day
i
should
be
strongly
disposed
to
go
for
that
benevolent
person
with
my
pick
that
is
surely
what
every
natural
man
would
want
to
do
and
it
is
only
the
clumsy
imperfection
of
our
social
organisation
that
will
not
enable
a
man
to
do
his
stint
of
labour
in
a
few
vigorous
years
and
then
come
up
into
the
sunlight
for
good
and
all
it
is
along
that
line
that
i
feel
a
large
part
of
our
labour
reorganisation
over
and
beyond
that
conscription
must
ultimately
go
the
community
as
a
whole
would
i
believe
get
far
more
out
of
a
man
if
he
had
such
a
comparatively
brief
passion
of
toil
than
if
he
worked
with
occasional
lapses
into
unemployment
drearily
all
his
life
but
at
present
with
our
existing
system
of
employment
one
can
not
arrange
so
comprehensive
a
treatment
of
a
man
life
there
is
needed
some
state
or
organisation
which
shall
stand
between
the
man
and
the
employer
act
as
his
banker
and
guarantor
and
exact
his
proper
price
then
with
his
toil
over
he
would
have
an
adequate
pension
and
be
free
to
do
nothing
or
anything
else
as
he
chose
in
a
socialistic
order
of
society
where
the
state
would
also
be
largely
the
employer
such
a
method
would
be
of
course
far
more
easily
contrived
the
more
modern
statements
of
socialism
do
not
contemplate
making
the
state
the
sole
employer
it
is
chiefly
in
transport
mining
fisheries
forestry
the
cultivation
of
the
food
staples
and
the
manufacture
of
a
few
such
articles
as
bricks
and
steel
and
possibly
in
housing
in
what
one
might
call
the
standardisable
industries
that
the
state
is
imagined
as
the
direct
owner
and
employer
and
it
is
just
in
these
departments
that
the
bulk
of
the
irksome
toil
is
to
be
found
there
remain
large
regions
of
more
specialised
and
individualised
production
that
many
socialists
nowadays
are
quite
prepared
to
leave
to
the
freer
initiatives
of
private
enterprise
most
of
these
are
occupations
involving
a
greater
element
of
interest
less
direction
and
more
and
it
is
just
here
that
the
success
of
and
a
sustained
life
participation
becomes
possible
this
complete
civilised
system
without
a
specialised
labour
class
is
not
simply
a
possibility
it
is
necessary
the
whole
social
movement
of
the
time
the
stars
in
their
courses
war
against
the
permanence
of
the
present
state
of
affairs
the
alternative
to
this
gigantic
effort
to
rearrange
our
world
is
not
a
continuation
of
muddling
along
but
social
war
the
syndicalist
and
his
folly
will
be
the
avenger
of
lost
opportunities
not
a
labour
state
do
we
want
nor
a
servile
state
but
a
powerful
leisure
state
of
free
men
the
great
state
sec
for
many
years
now
i
have
taken
a
part
in
the
discussion
of
socialism
during
that
time
socialism
has
become
a
more
and
more
ambiguous
term
it
has
seemed
to
me
desirable
to
clear
up
my
own
ideas
of
social
progress
and
the
public
side
of
my
life
by
restating
them
and
this
i
have
attempted
in
this
essay
in
order
to
do
so
it
has
been
convenient
to
coin
two
expressions
and
to
employ
them
with
a
certain
defined
intention
they
are
firstly
the
normal
social
life
and
secondly
the
great
state
throughout
this

these
expressions
will
be
used
in
accordance
with
the
definitions
presently
to
be
given
and
the
fact
that
they
are
so
used
will
be
emphasised
by
the
employment
of
capitals
it
will
be
possible
for
anyone
to
argue
that
what
is
here
defined
as
the
normal
social
life
is
not
the
normal
social
life
and
that
the
great
state
is
indeed
no
state
at
all
that
will
be
an
argument
outside
the
range
delimited
by
these
definitions
now
what
is
intended
by
the
normal
social
life
here
is
a
type
of
human
association
and
employment
of
extreme
prevalence
and
antiquity
which
appears
to
have
been
the
lot
of
the
enormous
majority
of
human
beings
as
far
back
as
history
or
tradition
or
the
vestiges
of
material
that
supply
our
conceptions
of
the
neolithic
period
can
carry
us
it
has
never
been
the
lot
of
all
humanity
at
any
time
it
is
perhaps
less
predominant
than
it
has
ever
been
yet
even
it
is
probably
the
lot
of
the
greater
moiety
of
mankind
essentially
this
type
of
association
presents
a
localised
community
a
community
of
which
the
greater
proportion
of
the
individuals
are
engaged
more
or
less
directly
in
the
cultivation
of
the
land
with
this
there
is
also
associated
the
grazing
or
herding
over
wider
or
more
restricted
areas
belonging
either
collectively
or
discretely
to
the
community
of
sheep
cattle
goats
or
swine
and
almost
always
the
domestic
fowl
is
commensal
with
man
in
this
life
the
cultivated
land
at
least
is
usually
assigned
temporarily
or
inalienably
as
property
to
specific
individuals
and
the
individuals
are
grouped
in
generally
monogamic
families
of
which
the
father
is
the
head
essentially
the
social
unit
is
the
family
and
even
where
as
in
mohammedan
countries
there
is
no
legal
or
customary
restriction
upon
polygamy
monogamy
still
prevails
as
the
ordinary
way
of
living
unmarried
women
are
not
esteemed
and
children
are
desired
according
to
the
dangers
or
securities
of
the
region
the
nature
of
the
cultivation
and
the
temperament
of
the
people
this
community
is
scattered
either
widely
in
separate
steadings
or
drawn
together
into
villages
at
one
extreme
over
large
areas
of
thin
pasture
this
agricultural
community
may
verge
on
the
nomadic
at
another
in
proximity
to
consuming
markets
it
may
present
the
concentration
of
intensive
culture
there
may
be
an
adjacent
wild
supplying
wood
and
perhaps
controlled
by
a
simple
forestry
the
law
that
holds
this
community
together
is
largely
traditional
and
customary
and
almost
always
as
its
primordial
bond
there
is
some
sort
of
temple
and
some
sort
of
priest
typically
the
temple
is
devoted
to
a
local
god
or
a
localised
saint
and
its
position
indicates
the
central
point
of
the
locality
its
assembly
place
and
its
market
associated
with
the
agriculture
there
are
usually
a
few
imperfectly
specialised
tradesmen
a
smith
a
perhaps
a
or
potter
who
group
about
the
church
or
temple
the
community
may
maintain
itself
in
a
state
of
complete
isolation
but
more
usually
there
are
tracks
or
roads
to
the
centres
of
adjacent
communities
and
a
certain
drift
of
travel
a
certain
trade
in
things
in
the
fundamentals
of
life
this
normal
community
is
independent
and
and
where
it
is
not
beginning
to
be
modified
by
the
novel
forces
of
the
new
times
it
produces
its
own
food
and
drink
its
own
clothing
and
largely
intermarries
within
its
limits
this
in
general
terms
is
what
is
here
intended
by
the
phrase
the
normal
social
life
it
is
still
the
substantial
part
of
the
rural
life
of
all
europe
and
most
asia
and
africa
and
it
has
been
the
life
of
the
great
majority
of
human
beings
for
immemorial
years
it
is
the
root
life
it
rests
upon
the
soil
and
from
that
soil
below
and
its
reaction
to
the
seasons
and
the
moods
of
the
sky
overhead
have
grown
most
of
the
traditions
institutions
sentiments
beliefs
superstitions
and
fundamental
songs
and
stories
of
mankind
but
since
the
very
dawn
of
history
at
least
this
normal
social
life
has
never
been
the
whole
complete
life
of
mankind
quite
apart
from
the
marginal
life
of
the
savage
hunter
there
have
been
a
number
of
forces
and
influences
within
men
and
women
and
without
that
have
produced
abnormal
and
surplus
ways
of
living
supplemental
additional
and
even
antagonistic
to
this
normal
scheme
and
first
as
to
the
forces
within
men
and
women
long
as
it
has
lasted
almost
universal
as
it
has
been
the
human
being
has
never
yet
achieved
a
perfect
adaptation
to
the
needs
of
the
normal
social
life
he
has
attained
nothing
of
that
frictionless
fitting
to
the
needs
of
association
one
finds
in
the
bee
or
the
ant
curiosity
deep
stirrings
to
wander
the
still
more
ancient
inheritance
of
the
hunter
a
recurrent
distaste
for
labour
and
resentment
against
the
necessary
subjugations
of
family
life
have
always
been
a
straining
force
within
the
agricultural
community
the
increase
of
population
during
periods
of
prosperity
has
led
at
the
touch
of
bad
seasons
and
adversity
to
the
desperate
reliefs
of
war
and
the
invasion
of
alien
localities
and
the
nomadic
and
adventurous
spirit
of
man
found
reliefs
and
opportunities
more
particularly
along
the
shores
of
great
rivers
and
inland
seas
trade
and
travel
began
at
first
only
a
trade
in
adventitious
things
in
metals
and
rare
objects
and
luxuries
and
slaves
with
trade
came
writing
and
money
the
inventions
of
debt
and
rent
usury
and
tribute
history
finds
already
in
its
beginnings
a
thin
network
of
trading
and
slaving
flung
over
the
world
of
the
normal
social
life
a
network
whose
strands
are
the
early
roads
whose
knots
are
the
first
towns
and
the
first
courts
indeed
all
recorded
history
is
in
a
sense
the
history
of
these
surplus
and
supplemental
activities
of
mankind
the
normal
social
life
flowed
on
in
its
immemorial
fashion
using
no
letters
needing
no
records
leaving
no
history
then
a
little
minority
bulking
disproportionately
in
the
record
come
the
trader
the
sailor
the
slave
the
landlord
and
the
the
townsman
and
the
king
all
written
history
is
the
story
of
a
minority
and
their
peculiar
and
abnormal
affairs
save
in
so
far
as
it
notes
great
natural
catastrophes
and
tells
of
the
spreading
or
retrocession
of
human
life
through
changes
of
climate
and
physical
conditions
it
resolves
itself
into
an
account
of
a
series
of
attacks
and
modifications
and
supplements
made
by
excessive
and
superfluous
forces
engendered
within
the
community
upon
the
normal
social
life
the
very
invention
of
writing
is
a
part
of
those
modifying
developments
the
normal
social
life
is
essentially
illiterate
and
traditional
the
normal
social
life
is
as
mute
as
the
standing
crops
it
is
as
seasonal
and
cyclic
as
nature
herself
and
reaches
towards
the
future
only
an
intimation
of
continual
repetitions
now
this
human
may
take
either
beneficent
or
maleficent
or
neutral
aspects
towards
the
general
life
of
humanity
it
may
present
itself
as
law
and
pacification
as
a
positive
addition
and
superstructure
to
the
normal
social
life
as
roads
and
markets
and
cities
as
courts
and
unifying
monarchies
as
helpful
and
directing
religious
organisations
as
literature
and
art
and
science
and
philosophy
reflecting
back
upon
the
individual
in
the
normal
social
life
from
which
it
arose
a
gilding
and
refreshment
of
new
and
wider
interests
and
added
pleasures
and
resources
one
may
define
certain
phases
in
the
history
of
various
countries
when
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
a
countryside
of
prosperous
communities
with
a
healthy
family
life
and
a
wide
distribution
of
property
animated
by
roads
and
towns
and
unified
by
a
generally
intelligible
religious
belief
lived
in
a
transitory
but
satisfactory
harmony
under
a
sympathetic
government
i
take
it
that
this
is
the
condition
to
which
the
minds
of
such
original
and
vigorous
reactionary
thinkers
as
chesterton
and
hilaire
belloc
for
example
turn
as
being
the
most
desirable
state
of
mankind
but
the
general
effect
of
history
is
to
present
these
phases
as
phases
of
exceptional
good
luck
and
to
show
the
surplus
forces
of
humanity
as
on
the
whole
antagonistic
to
any
such
equilibrium
with
the
normal
social
life
to
open
the
book
of
history
haphazard
is
most
commonly
to
open
it
at
a
page
where
the
surplus
forces
appear
to
be
in
more
or
less
destructive
conflict
with
the
normal
social
life
one
opens
at
the
depopulation
of
italy
by
the
aggressive
great
estates
of
the
roman
empire
at
the
impoverishment
of
the
french
peasantry
by
a
too
centralised
monarchy
before
the
revolution
or
at
the
huge
degenerative
growth
of
the
great
industrial
towns
of
western
europe
in
the
nineteenth
century
or
again
one
opens
at
destructive
wars
one
sees
these
surplus
forces
over
and
above
the
normal
social
life
working
towards
unstable
concentrations
of
population
to
centralisation
of
government
to
migrations
and
conflicts
upon
a
large
scale
one
discovers
the
process
developing
into
a
phase
of
social
fragmentation
and
destruction
and
then
unless
the
whole
country
has
been
wasted
down
to
its
very
soil
the
normal
social
life
returns
as
the
heath
and
furze
and
grass
return
after
the
burning
of
a
common
but
it
never
returns
in
precisely
its
old
form
the
surplus
forces
have
always
produced
some
traceable
change
the
rhythm
is
a
little
altered
as
between
the
gallic
peasant
before
the
roman
conquest
the
peasant
of
the
gallic
province
the
carlovingian
peasant
the
french
peasant
of
the
thirteenth
the
seventeenth
and
the
twentieth
centuries
there
is
in
spite
of
a
general
uniformity
of
life
of
a
common
atmosphere
of
cows
hens
dung
toil
ploughing
economy
and
domestic
intimacy
an
effect
of
accumulating
generalising
influences
and
of
wider
relevancies
and
the
oscillations
of
empires
and
kingdoms
religious
movements
wars
invasions
settlements
leave
upon
the
mind
an
impression
that
the
surplus
life
of
mankind
the
life
of
mankind
that
life
of
mankind
which
is
not
directly
connected
with
the
soil
but
which
has
become
more
or
less
detached
from
and
independent
of
it
is
becoming
proportionately
more
important
in
relation
to
the
normal
social
life
it
is
as
if
a
different
way
of
living
was
emerging
from
the
normal
social
life
and
freeing
itself
from
its
traditions
and
limitations
and
this
is
more
particularly
the
effect
upon
the
mind
of
a
review
of
the
history
of
the
past
two
hundred
years
the
little
speculative
activities
of
the
alchemist
and
natural
philosopher
the
little
economic
experiments
of
the
acquisitive
and
enterprising
landed
proprietor
favoured
by
unprecedented
periods
of
security
and
freedom
have
passed
into
a
new
phase
of
extraordinary
productivity
they
had
added
preposterously
and
continue
to
add
on
a
gigantic
scale
and
without
any
evident
limits
to
the
continuation
of
their
additions
to
the
resources
of
humanity
to
the
strength
of
horses
and
men
and
slaves
has
been
added
the
power
of
machines
and
the
possibility
of
economies
that
were
once
incredible
the
normal
social
life
has
been
overshadowed
as
it
has
never
been
overshadowed
before
by
the
concentrations
and
achievements
of
the
surplus
life
vast
new
possibilities
open
to
the
race
the
traditional
life
of
mankind
its
traditional
systems
of
association
are
challenged
and
threatened
and
all
the
social
thought
all
the
political
activity
of
our
time
turns
in
reality
upon
the
conflict
of
this
ancient
system
whose
essentials
we
have
here
defined
and
termed
the
normal
social
life
with
the
still
vague
and
formless
impulses
that
seem
destined
either
to
involve
it
and
the
race
in
a
final
destruction
or
to
replace
it
by
some
new
and
probably
more
elaborate
method
of
human
association
because
there
is
the
following
difference
between
the
action
of
the
surplus
forces
as
we
see
them
and
as
they
appeared
before
the
outbreak
of
physical
science
and
mechanism
then
it
seemed
clearly
necessary
that
whatever
social
and
political
organisation
developed
it
must
needs
rest
ultimately
on
the
tiller
of
the
soil
the
agricultural
holding
and
the
normal
social
life
but
now
even
in
agriculture
huge
wholesale
methods
have
appeared
they
are
declared
to
be
destructive
but
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
they
may
be
made
ultimately
as
recuperative
as
that
small
agriculture
which
has
hitherto
been
the
inevitable
social
basis
if
that
is
so
then
the
new
ways
of
living
may
not
simply
impose
themselves
in
a
growing
proportion
upon
the
normal
social
life
but
they
may
even
oust
it
and
replace
it
altogether
or
they
may
oust
it
and
fail
to
replace
it
in
the
newer
countries
the
normal
social
life
does
not
appear
to
establish
itself
at
all
rapidly
no
real
peasantry
appears
in
either
america
or
australia
and
in
the
older
countries
unless
there
is
the
most
elaborate
legislative
and
fiscal
protection
the
peasant
population
wanes
before
the
large
farm
the
estate
and
overseas
production
now
most
of
the
political
and
social
discussion
of
the
last
hundred
years
may
be
regarded
and
rephrased
as
an
attempt
to
apprehend
this
defensive
struggle
of
the
normal
social
life
against
waxing
novelty
and
innovation
and
to
give
a
direction
and
guidance
to
all
of
us
who
participate
and
it
is
very
largely
a
matter
of
temperament
and
free
choice
still
just
where
we
shall
decide
to
place
ourselves
let
us
consider
some
of
the
key
words
of
contemporary
thought
such
as
liberalism
individualism
socialism
in
the
light
of
this
broad
generalisation
we
have
made
and
then
we
shall
find
it
easier
to
explain
our
intention
in
employing
as
a
second
technicality
the
phrase
of
the
great
state
as
an
opposite
to
the
normal
social
life
which
we
have
already
defined
sec
the
normal
social
life
has
been
defined
as
one
based
on
agriculture
traditional
and
essentially
unchanging
it
has
needed
no
toleration
and
displayed
no
toleration
for
novelty
and
strangeness
its
beliefs
have
been
on
such
a
nature
as
to
justify
and
sustain
itself
and
it
has
had
an
intrinsic
hostility
to
any
other
beliefs
the
god
of
its
community
has
been
a
jealous
god
even
when
he
was
only
a
tribal
and
local
god
only
very
occasionally
in
history
until
the
coming
of
the
modern
period
do
we
find
any
human
community
relaxing
from
this
ancient
and
more
normal
state
of
entire
intolerance
towards
ideas
or
practices
other
than
its
own
when
toleration
and
a
receptive
attitude
towards
alien
ideas
was
manifested
in
the
old
world
it
was
at
some
trading
centre
or
political
centre
new
ideas
and
new
religions
came
by
water
along
the
trade
routes
and
such
toleration
as
there
was
rarely
extended
to
active
teaching
and
propaganda
even
in
liberal
athens
the
hemlock
was
in
the
last
resort
at
the
service
of
the
ancient
gods
and
the
ancient
morals
against
the
sceptical
critic
but
with
the
steady
development
of
innovating
forces
in
human
affairs
there
has
actually
grown
up
a
cult
of
receptivity
a
readiness
for
new
ideas
a
faith
in
the
probable
truth
of
novelties
liberalism
i
do
not
of
course
refer
in
any
way
to
the
political
party
which
makes
this
profession
is
essentially
its
tendency
is
to
commit
for
trial
any
institution
or
belief
that
is
brought
before
it
it
is
the
accuser
and
antagonist
of
all
the
fixed
and
ancient
values
and
imperatives
and
prohibitions
of
the
normal
social
life
and
growing
up
in
relation
to
liberalism
and
sustained
by
it
is
the
great
body
of
scientific
knowledge
which
professes
at
least
to
be
absolutely
undogmatic
and
perpetually
on
its
trial
and
under
assay
and
now
a
very
large
part
of
the
advanced
thought
of
the
past
century
is
no
more
than
the
confused
negation
of
the
broad
beliefs
and
institutions
which
have
been
the
heritage
and
social
basis
of
humanity
for
immemorial
years
this
is
as
true
of
the
extremest
individualism
as
of
the
extremest
socialism
the
former
denies
that
element
of
legal
and
customary
control
which
has
always
subdued
the
individual
to
the
needs
of
the
normal
social
life
and
the
latter
that
qualified
independence
of
distributed
property
which
is
the
basis
of
family
autonomy
both
are
movements
against
the
ancient
life
and
nothing
is
more
absurd
than
the
misrepresentation
which
presents
either
as
a
conservative
force
they
are
two
divergent
schools
with
a
common
disposition
to
reject
the
old
and
turn
towards
the
new
the
individualist
professes
a
faith
for
which
he
has
no
rational
evidence
that
the
mere
abandonment
of
traditions
and
controls
must
ultimately
produce
a
new
and
beautiful
social
order
while
the
socialist
with
an
equal
liberalism
regards
the
outlook
with
a
kind
of
hopeful
dread
and
insists
upon
an
elaborate
readjustment
a
new
and
untried
scheme
of
social
organisation
to
replace
the
shattered
and
weakening
normal
social
life
both
these
movements
and
indeed
all
movements
that
are
not
movements
for
the
subjugation
of
innovation
and
the
restoration
of
tradition
are
vague
in
the
prospect
they
contemplate
they
produce
no
definite
forecasts
of
the
quality
of
the
future
towards
which
they
so
confidently
indicate
the
way
but
this
is
less
true
of
modern
socialism
than
of
its
antithesis
and
it
becomes
less
and
less
true
as
socialism
under
an
enormous
torrent
of
criticism
slowly
washes
itself
clean
from
the
mass
of
partial
statement
hasty
misstatement
sheer
error
and
presumption
that
obscured
its
first
emergence
but
it
is
well
to
be
very
clear
upon
one
point
at
this
stage
and
that
is
that
this
present
time
is
not
a
between
individualism
and
socialism
it
is
a
between
the
normal
social
life
on
the
one
hand
and
a
complex
of
forces
on
the
other
which
seek
a
form
of
replacement
and
seem
partially
to
find
it
in
these
and
other
doctrines
nearly
all
contemporary
thinkers
who
are
not
too
muddled
to
be
assignable
fall
into
one
of
three
classes
of
which
the
third
we
shall
distinguish
is
the
largest
and
most
various
and
divergent
it
will
be
convenient
to
say
a
little
of
each
of
these
classes
before
proceeding
to
a
more
particular
account
of
the
third
our
analysis
will
cut
across
many
accepted
classifications
but
there
will
be
ample
justification
for
this
rearrangement
all
of
them
may
be
dealt
with
quite
justly
as
accepting
the
general
account
of
the
historical
process
which
is
here
given
then
first
we
must
distinguish
a
series
of
writers
and
thinkers
which
one
may
call
the
word
conservative
being
already
politically
assigned
the
conservators
these
are
people
who
really
do
consider
the
normal
social
life
as
the
only
proper
and
desirable
life
for
the
great
mass
of
humanity
and
they
are
fully
prepared
to
subordinate
all
exceptional
and
surplus
lives
to
the
moral
standards
and
limitations
that
arise
naturally
out
of
the
normal
social
life
they
desire
a
state
in
which
property
is
widely
distributed
a
community
of
independent
families
protected
by
law
and
an
intelligent
democratic
statecraft
from
the
economic
aggressions
of
large
accumulations
and
linked
by
a
common
religion
their
attitude
to
the
forces
of
change
is
necessarily
a
hostile
attitude
they
are
disposed
to
regard
innovations
in
transit
and
machinery
as
undesirable
and
even
mischievous
disturbances
of
a
wholesome
equilibrium
they
are
at
least
unfriendly
to
any
organisation
of
scientific
research
and
scornful
of
the
pretensions
of
science
criticisms
of
the
methods
of
logic
scepticism
of
the
more
widely
diffused
human
beliefs
they
would
classify
as
insanity
two
able
english
writers
chesterton
and
belloc
have
given
the
clearest
expression
to
this
system
of
ideals
and
stated
an
admirable
case
for
it
they
present
a
conception
of
vinous
loudly
singing
earthy
toiling
wholesome
and
insanitary
men
they
are
pagan
in
the
sense
that
their
hearts
are
with
the
villagers
and
not
with
the
townsmen
christian
in
the
spirit
of
the
parish
priest
there
are
no
other
conservators
so
and
consistent
but
their
teaching
is
merely
the
logical
expression
of
an
enormous
amount
of
conservative
feeling
vast
multitudes
of
less
lucid
minds
share
their
hostility
to
novelty
and
research
hate
dread
and
are
eager
to
despise
science
and
glow
responsive
to
the
warm
familiar
expressions
of
primordial
feelings
and
immemorial
prejudices
the
rural
conservative
the
liberal
of
the
allotments
and
type
roosevelt
in
his
philoprogenitive
phase
as
distinguished
from
the
phase
of
his
more
imperialist
moments
all
present
themselves
as
essentially
conservators
as
seekers
after
and
preservers
of
the
normal
social
life
so
too
do
socialists
of
the
william
morris
type
the
mind
of
william
morris
was
profoundly
reactionary
he
hated
the
whole
trend
of
later
modernism
with
the
hatred
natural
to
a
man
of
considerable
scholarship
and
intense
aesthetic
sensibilities
his
mind
turned
exactly
as
belloc
turns
to
the
finished
and
enriched
normal
social
life
of
western
europe
in
the
middle
ages
but
unlike
belloc
he
believed
that
given
private
ownership
of
land
and
the
ordinary
materials
of
life
there
must
necessarily
be
an
aggregatory
process
usury
expropriation
the
development
of
an
exploiting
wealthy
class
he
believed
profit
was
the
devil
his
news
from
nowhere
pictures
a
communism
that
amounted
in
fact
to
little
more
than
a
system
of
private
ownership
of
farms
and
trades
without
money
or
any
buying
and
selling
in
an
atmosphere
of
geniality
generosity
and
mutual
helpfulness
belloc
with
a
harder
grip
upon
the
realities
of
life
would
have
the
widest
distribution
of
proprietorship
with
an
alert
democratic
government
continually
legislating
against
the
protean
reappearances
of
usury
and
accumulation
and
attacking
breaking
up
and
redistributing
any
large
unanticipated
bodies
of
wealth
that
appeared
but
both
men
are
equally
set
towards
the
normal
social
life
and
equally
enemies
of
the
new
the
socialist
land
legislation
of
new
zealand
again
is
a
tentative
towards
the
realisation
of
the
same
school
of
ideas
great
estates
are
to
be
automatically
broken
up
property
is
to
be
kept
disseminated
a
vast
amount
of
political
speaking
and
writing
in
america
and
throughout
the
world
enforces
impression
of
the
widespread
influence
of
conservator
ideals
of
course
it
is
inevitable
that
phases
of
prosperity
for
the
normal
social
life
will
lead
to
phases
of
and
scarcity
there
will
be
occasional
famines
and
occasional
pestilences
and
plethoras
of
vitality
leading
to
the
of
war
i
suppose
chesterton
and
belloc
at
least
have
the
courage
of
their
opinions
and
are
prepared
to
say
that
such
things
always
have
been
and
always
must
be
they
are
part
of
the
jolly
rhythms
of
the
human
lot
under
the
sun
and
are
to
be
taken
with
the
harvest
home
and
and
the
peaceful
ending
of
honoured
lives
as
an
integral
part
of
the
unending
drama
of
mankind
sec
now
opposed
to
the
conservators
are
all
those
who
do
not
regard
contemporary
humanity
as
a
final
thing
nor
the
normal
social
life
as
the
inevitable
basis
of
human
continuity
they
believe
in
secular
change
in
progress
in
a
future
for
our
species
differing
continually
more
from
its
past
on
the
whole
they
are
prepared
for
the
gradual
disentanglement
of
men
from
the
normal
social
life
altogether
and
they
look
for
new
ways
of
living
and
new
methods
of
human
association
with
a
certain
adventurous
hopefulness
now
this
second
large
class
does
not
so
much
admit
of
subdivision
into
two
as
present
a
great
variety
of
intermediaries
between
two
extremes
i
propose
to
give
distinctive
names
to
these
extremes
with
the
very
clear
proviso
that
they
are
not
antagonised
and
that
the
great
multitude
of
this
second
class
this
liberal
more
novel
class
modern
conditions
have
produced
falls
between
them
and
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
but
partaking
in
various
degrees
of
both
on
the
one
hand
then
we
have
that
type
of
mind
which
is
irritated
by
and
distrustful
of
all
collective
proceedings
which
is
profoundly
distrustful
of
churches
and
states
which
is
expressed
essentially
by
individualism
the
individualist
appears
to
regard
the
extensive
disintegrations
of
the
normal
social
life
that
are
going
on
with
an
extreme
hopefulness
whatever
is
ugly
or
harsh
in
modern
industrialism
or
in
the
novel
social
development
of
our
time
he
seems
to
consider
as
a
necessary
aspect
of
a
process
of
selection
and
survival
whose
tendencies
are
on
the
whole
inevitably
satisfactory
the
future
welfare
of
man
he
believes
in
effect
may
be
trusted
to
the
spontaneous
and
planless
activities
of
people
of
goodwill
and
nothing
but
state
intervention
can
effectively
impede
its
attainment
and
curiously
close
to
this
extreme
optimistic
school
in
its
moral
quality
and
logical
consequences
though
contrasting
widely
in
the
sinister
gloom
of
its
spirit
is
the
socialism
of
karl
marx
he
declared
the
contemporary
world
to
be
a
great
process
of
financial
aggrandisement
and
general
expropriation
of
increasing
power
for
the
few
and
of
increasing
hardship
and
misery
for
the
many
a
process
that
would
go
on
until
at
last
a
crisis
of
unendurable
tension
would
be
reached
and
the
social
revolution
ensue
the
world
had
in
fact
to
be
worse
before
it
could
hope
to
be
better
he
contemplated
a
continually
exacerbated
class
war
with
a
millennium
of
extraordinary
vagueness
beyond
as
the
reward
of
the
victorious
workers
his
common
quality
with
the
individualist
lies
in
his
repudiation
of
and
antagonism
to
plans
and
arrangements
in
his
belief
in
the
overriding
power
of
law
their
common
influence
is
the
discouragement
of
collective
understandings
upon
the
basis
of
the
existing
state
both
converge
in
practice
upon
i
would
therefore
lump
them
together
under
the
term
of
planless
progressives
and
i
would
contrast
with
them
those
types
which
believe
supremely
in
systematised
purpose
the
purposeful
and
systematic
types
in
common
with
the
individualist
and
marxist
regard
the
normal
social
life
for
all
the
many
thousands
of
years
behind
it
as
a
phase
and
as
a
phase
which
is
now
passing
in
human
experience
and
they
are
prepared
for
a
future
society
that
may
be
ultimately
different
right
down
to
its
essential
relationships
from
the
human
past
but
they
also
believe
that
the
forces
that
have
been
assailing
and
disintegrating
the
normal
social
life
which
have
been
on
the
one
hand
producing
great
accumulations
of
wealth
private
freedom
and
irresponsible
and
socially
dangerous
power
and
on
the
other
labour
hordes
for
the
most
part
urban
without
any
property
or
outlook
except
continuous
toil
and
anxiety
which
in
england
have
substituted
a
dischargeable
agricultural
labourer
for
the
independent
peasant
almost
completely
and
in
america
seem
to
be
arresting
any
general
development
of
the
normal
social
life
at
all
are
forces
of
wide
and
indefinite
possibility
that
need
to
be
controlled
by
a
collective
effort
implying
a
collective
design
deflected
from
merely
injurious
consequences
and
organised
for
a
new
human
welfare
upon
new
lines
they
agree
with
that
class
of
thinking
i
have
distinguished
as
the
conservators
in
their
recognition
of
vast
contemporary
disorders
and
their
denial
of
the
essential
beneficence
of
change
but
while
the
former
seem
to
regard
all
novelty
and
innovation
as
a
mere
inundation
to
be
met
banked
back
defeated
and
survived
these
more
hopeful
and
adventurous
minds
would
rather
regard
contemporary
change
as
amounting
on
the
whole
to
the
tumultuous
and
almost
catastrophic
of
possible
new
channels
the
violent
opportunity
of
vast
deep
new
ways
to
great
unprecedented
human
ends
ends
that
are
neither
feared
nor
evaded
now
while
the
conservators
are
continually
talking
of
the
eternal
facts
of
human
life
and
human
nature
and
falling
back
upon
a
conception
of
permanence
that
is
continually
less
true
as
our
perspectives
extend
these
others
are
full
of
the
conception
of
adaptation
of
deliberate
change
in
relationship
and
institution
to
meet
changing
needs
i
would
suggest
for
them
therefore
as
opposed
to
the
conservators
and
contrasted
with
the
planless
progressives
the
name
of
constructors
they
are
the
extreme
right
as
it
were
while
the
planless
progressives
are
the
extreme
left
of
thought
i
believe
that
these
distinctions
i
have
made
cover
practically
every
clear
form
of
contemporary
thinking
and
are
a
better
and
more
helpful
classification
than
any
now
current
but
of
course
nearly
every
individual
nowadays
is
at
least
a
little
confused
and
will
be
found
to
wobble
in
the
course
even
of
a
brief
discussion
between
one
attitude
and
the
other
this
is
a
separation
of
opinions
rather
than
of
persons
and
particularly
that
word
socialism
has
become
so
vague
and
incoherent
that
for
a
man
to
call
himself
a
socialist
nowadays
is
to
give
no
indication
whatever
whether
he
is
a
conservator
like
william
morris
a
like
karl
marx
or
a
constructor
of
any
of
half
a
dozen
different
schools
on
the
whole
however
modern
socialism
tends
to
fall
towards
the
constructor
wing
so
too
do
those
various
movements
in
england
and
germany
and
france
called
variously
nationalist
and
imperialist
and
so
do
the
american
civic
and
social
reformers
under
the
same
heading
must
come
such
attempts
to
give
the
vague
impulses
of
syndicalism
a
concrete
definition
as
the
guild
socialism
of
orage
all
these
movements
are
agreed
that
the
world
is
progressive
towards
a
novel
and
unprecedented
social
order
not
necessarily
and
fatally
better
and
that
it
needs
organised
and
even
institutional
guidance
thither
however
much
they
differ
as
to
the
form
that
order
should
assume
for
the
greater
portion
of
a
century
socialism
has
been
before
the
world
and
it
is
not
perhaps
premature
to
attempt
a
word
or
so
of
analysis
of
that
great
movement
in
the
new
terms
we
are
here
employing
the
origins
of
the
socialist
idea
were
complex
and
multifarious
never
at
any
time
has
it
succeeded
in
separating
out
a
statement
of
itself
that
was
at
once
simple
complete
and
acceptable
to
any
large
proportion
of
those
who
call
themselves
socialists
but
always
it
has
pointed
to
two
or
three
definite
things
the
first
of
these
is
that
unlimited
freedoms
of
private
property
with
increasing
facilities
of
exchange
combination
and
aggrandisement
become
more
and
more
dangerous
to
human
liberty
by
the
expropriation
and
reduction
to
private
wages
slavery
of
larger
and
larger
proportions
of
the
population
every
school
of
socialism
states
this
in
some
more
or
less
complete
form
however
divergent
the
remedial
methods
suggested
by
the
different
schools
and
next
every
school
of
socialism
accepts
the
concentration
of
management
and
property
as
necessary
and
declines
to
contemplate
what
is
the
typical
conservator
remedy
its
accordingly
it
sets
up
not
only
against
the
large
private
owner
but
against
owners
generally
the
idea
of
a
public
proprietor
the
state
which
shall
hold
in
the
collective
interest
but
where
the
earlier
socialisms
stopped
short
and
where
to
this
day
socialism
is
vague
divided
and
unprepared
is
upon
the
psychological
problems
involved
in
that
new
and
largely
unprecedented
form
of
proprietorship
and
upon
the
still
more
subtle
problems
of
its
attainment
these
are
vast
and
profoundly
widely
and
multitudinously
difficult
problems
and
it
was
natural
and
inevitable
that
the
earlier
socialists
in
the
first
enthusiasm
of
their
idea
should
minimise
these
difficulties
pretend
in
the
fullness
of
their
faith
that
partial
answers
to
objections
were
complete
answers
and
display
the
common
weaknesses
of
honest
propaganda
the
whole
world
over
socialism
is
now
old
enough
to
know
better
few
modern
socialists
present
their
faith
as
a
complete
panacea
and
most
are
now
setting
to
work
in
earnest
upon
these
preliminary
problems
of
human
interaction
through
which
the
vital
problem
of
a
collective
head
and
brain
can
alone
be
approached
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
socialist
movement
remains
as
it
has
been
from
the
first
vaguely
democratic
it
points
to
collective
ownership
with
no
indication
of
the
administrative
scheme
it
contemplates
to
realise
that
intention
necessarily
it
remains
a
formless
claim
without
hands
to
take
hold
of
the
thing
it
desires
indeed
in
a
large
number
of
cases
it
is
scarcely
more
than
a
resentful
consciousness
in
the
expropriated
masses
of
social
disintegration
it
spends
its
force
very
largely
in
mere
revenges
upon
property
as
such
attacks
simply
destructive
by
reason
of
the
absence
of
any
definite
ulterior
scheme
it
is
an
and
planless
belligerent
who
must
destroy
whatever
he
captures
because
he
can
neither
use
nor
take
away
a
council
of
democratic
socialists
in
possession
of
london
would
be
as
capable
of
an
orderly
and
sustained
administration
as
the
anabaptists
in
munster
but
the
discomforts
and
disorders
of
our
present
planless
system
do
tend
steadily
to
the
development
of
this
crude
socialistic
spirit
in
the
mass
of
the
proletariat
merely
vindictive
attacks
upon
property
sabotage
and
the
general
strike
are
the
logical
and
inevitable
consequences
of
an
uncontrolled
concentration
of
property
in
a
few
hands
and
such
things
must
and
will
go
on
the
deep
undertow
in
the
deliquescence
of
the
normal
social
life
until
a
new
justice
a
new
scheme
of
compensations
and
satisfactions
is
attained
or
the
normal
social
life
fabian
socialism
was
the
first
systematic
attempt
to
meet
the
fatal
absence
of
administrative
schemes
in
the
earlier
socialisms
it
can
scarcely
be
regarded
now
as
anything
but
an
interesting
failure
but
a
failure
that
has
all
the
educational
value
of
a
first
reconnaissance
into
unexplored
territory
starting
from
that
attack
on
aggregating
property
which
is
the
common
of
all
socialist
projects
the
fabians
appalled
at
the
obvious
difficulties
of
honest
confiscation
and
an
open
transfer
from
private
to
public
hands
conceived
the
extraordinary
idea
of
property
for
the
state
a
small
body
of
people
of
extreme
astuteness
were
to
bring
about
the
municipalisation
and
nationalisation
first
of
this
great
system
of
property
and
then
of
that
in
a
manner
so
artful
that
the
millionaires
were
to
wake
up
one
morning
at
last
and
behold
they
would
find
themselves
poor
men
for
a
decade
or
more
pease
bernard
shaw
and
sidney
webb
besant
lawson
dodd
and
their
associates
of
the
london
fabian
society
did
pit
their
wits
and
ability
or
at
any
rate
the
wits
and
ability
of
their
leisure
moments
against
the
embattled
capitalists
of
england
and
the
world
in
this
complicated
and
delicate
enterprise
without
any
apparent
diminution
of
the
larger
accumulations
of
wealth
but
in
addition
they
developed
another
side
of
fabianism
still
more
subtle
which
professed
to
be
a
kind
of
restoration
in
kind
of
property
to
the
proletariat
and
in
this
direction
they
were
more
successful
a
dexterous
use
they
decided
was
to
be
made
of
the
poor
law
the
public
health
authority
the
education
authority
and
building
regulations
and
so
forth
to
create
so
to
speak
a
communism
of
the
lower
levels
the
mass
of
people
whom
the
forces
of
change
had
expropriated
were
to
be
given
a
certain
minimum
of
food
shelter
education
and
sanitation
and
this
the
socialists
were
assured
could
be
used
as
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
towards
a
complete
communism
the
minimum
once
established
could
obviously
be
raised
continually
until
either
everybody
had
what
they
needed
or
the
resources
of
society
gave
out
and
set
a
limit
to
the
process
this
second
method
of
attack
brought
the
fabian
movement
into
with
a
large
amount
of
benevolent
and
constructive
influence
outside
the
socialist
ranks
altogether
few
wealthy
people
really
grudge
the
poor
a
share
of
the
necessities
of
life
and
most
are
quite
willing
to
assist
in
projects
for
such
a
distribution
but
while
these
schemes
naturally
involved
a
very
great
amount
of
regulation
and
regimentation
of
the
affairs
of
the
poor
the
fabian
society
fell
away
more
and
more
from
its
associated
proposals
for
the
socialisation
of
the
rich
the
fabian
project
changed
steadily
in
character
until
at
last
it
ceased
to
be
in
any
sense
antagonistic
to
wealth
as
such
if
the
lion
did
not
exactly
lie
down
with
the
lamb
at
any
rate
the
man
with
the
gun
and
the
alleged
social
mad
dog
returned
very
peaceably
together
the
fabian
hunt
was
up
great
financiers
contributed
generously
to
a
school
of
economics
that
had
been
founded
with
moneys
left
to
the
fabian
society
by
earlier
enthusiasts
for
socialist
propaganda
and
education
it
remained
for
belloc
to
point
the
moral
of
the
whole
development
with
a
phrase
to
note
that
fabianism
no
longer
aimed
at
the
socialisation
of
the
whole
community
but
only
at
the
socialisation
of
the
poor
the
first
really
complete
project
for
a
new
social
order
to
replace
the
normal
social
life
was
before
the
world
and
this
project
was
the
compulsory
regimentation
of
the
workers
and
the
complete
state
control
of
labour
under
a
new
plutocracy
our
present
chaos
was
to
be
organised
into
a
servile
state
sec
now
to
many
of
us
who
found
the
general
spirit
of
the
socialist
movement
at
least
hopeful
and
attractive
and
sympathetic
this
would
be
an
almost
tragic
conclusion
did
we
believe
that
fabianism
was
anything
more
than
the
first
experiment
in
planning
and
one
almost
inevitably
shallow
and
presumptuous
of
the
long
series
that
may
be
necessary
before
a
clear
light
breaks
upon
the
road
humanity
must
follow
but
we
decline
to
be
forced
by
this
one
intellectual
fiasco
towards
the
of
the
individualist
and
the
marxist
or
to
accept
the
normal
social
life
with
its
atmosphere
of
hens
and
cows
and
dung
its
incessant
toil
its
servitude
of
women
and
its
endless
repetitions
as
the
only
tolerable
life
conceivable
for
the
bulk
of
mankind
as
the
ultimate
life
that
is
of
mankind
with
less
arrogance
and
confidence
but
it
may
be
with
a
firmer
faith
we
declare
that
we
believe
a
more
spacious
social
order
than
any
that
exists
or
ever
has
existed
a
peace
of
the
world
in
which
there
is
an
almost
universal
freedom
health
happiness
and
and
which
contains
the
seeds
of
a
still
greater
future
is
possible
to
mankind
we
propose
to
begin
again
with
the
recognition
of
those
same
difficulties
the
fabians
first
realised
but
we
do
not
propose
to
organise
a
society
form
a
group
for
the
control
of
the
two
chief
political
parties
bring
about
socialism
in
years
or
do
anything
beyond
contributing
in
our
place
and
measure
to
that
constructive
discussion
whose
real
magnitude
we
now
begin
to
realise
we
have
faith
in
a
possible
future
but
it
is
a
faith
that
makes
the
quality
of
that
future
entirely
dependent
upon
the
strength
and
clearness
of
purpose
that
this
present
time
can
produce
we
do
not
believe
the
greater
social
state
is
inevitable
yet
there
is
we
hold
a
certain
qualified
inevitability
about
this
greater
social
state
because
we
believe
any
social
state
not
affording
a
general
contentment
a
general
freedom
and
a
general
and
increasing
fullness
of
life
must
sooner
or
later
collapse
and
disintegrate
again
and
revert
more
or
less
completely
to
the
normal
social
life
and
because
we
believe
the
normal
social
life
is
itself
with
the
seeds
of
fresh
beginnings
the
normal
social
life
has
never
at
any
time
been
absolutely
permanent
always
it
has
carried
within
itself
the
germs
of
enterprise
and
adventure
and
exchanges
that
finally
attack
its
stability
the
superimposed
social
order
of
such
as
it
is
with
its
huge
development
of
expropriated
labour
and
the
schemes
of
the
later
fabians
to
fix
this
state
of
affairs
in
an
organised
form
and
render
it
plausibly
tolerable
seem
also
doomed
to
accumulate
catastrophic
tensions
bureaucratic
schemes
for
establishing
the
regular
lifelong
subordination
of
a
labouring
class
enlivened
though
they
may
be
by
frequent
inspection
disciplinary
treatment
during
seasons
of
unemployment
compulsory
temperance
free
medical
attendance
and
a
cheap
and
shallow
elementary
education
fail
to
satisfy
the
restless
cravings
in
the
heart
of
man
they
are
cravings
that
even
the
baffling
methods
of
the
most
ingeniously
worked
conciliation
boards
can
not
permanently
restrain
the
drift
of
any
servile
state
must
be
towards
a
class
revolt
paralysing
sabotage
and
a
general
strike
the
more
rigid
and
complete
the
servile
state
becomes
the
more
thorough
will
be
its
ultimate
failure
its
fate
is
decay
or
explosion
from
its
débris
we
shall
either
revert
to
the
normal
social
life
and
begin
again
the
long
struggle
towards
that
ampler
happier
juster
arrangement
of
human
affairs
which
we
of
this
book
at
any
rate
believe
to
be
possible
or
we
shall
pass
into
the
twilight
of
mankind
this
greater
social
life
we
put
then
as
the
only
real
alternative
to
the
normal
social
life
from
which
man
is
continually
escaping
for
it
we
do
not
propose
to
use
the
expressions
the
socialist
state
or
socialism
because
we
believe
those
terms
have
now
by
constant
confused
use
become
so
battered
and
bent
and
discoloured
by
irrelevant
associations
as
to
be
rather
misleading
than
expressive
we
propose
to
use
the
term
the
great
state
to
express
this
ideal
of
a
social
system
no
longer
localised
no
longer
immediately
tied
to
and
conditioned
by
the
cultivation
of
the
land
in
its
interests
and
outlook
and
catholic
in
its
tolerance
and
sympathy
a
system
of
great
individual
freedom
with
a
universal
understanding
among
its
citizens
of
a
collective
thought
and
purpose
now
the
difficulties
that
lie
in
the
way
of
humanity
in
its
complex
and
toilsome
journey
through
the
coming
centuries
towards
this
great
state
are
fundamentally
difficulties
of
adaptation
and
adjustment
to
no
conceivable
social
state
is
man
inherently
fitted
he
is
a
creature
of
jealousy
and
suspicion
unstable
restless
acquisitive
aggressive
intractable
and
of
a
most
subtle
and
nimble
dishonesty
moreover
he
is
imaginative
adventurous
and
inventive
his
nature
and
instincts
are
as
much
in
conflict
with
the
necessary
restrictions
and
subjugation
of
the
normal
social
life
as
they
are
likely
to
be
with
any
other
social
net
that
necessity
may
weave
about
him
but
the
normal
social
life
has
this
advantage
that
it
has
a
vast
accumulated
moral
tradition
and
a
minutely
material
method
all
the
fundamental
institutions
have
arisen
in
relation
to
it
and
are
adapted
to
its
conditions
to
revert
to
it
after
any
phase
of
social
chaos
and
distress
is
and
will
continue
for
many
years
to
be
the
path
of
least
resistance
for
perplexed
humanity
this
conception
of
the
great
state
on
the
other
hand
is
still
altogether
unsubstantial
it
is
a
project
as
as
electric
lighting
electric
traction
or
aviation
would
have
been
in
the
year
in
a
man
reasonably
conversant
with
the
physical
science
of
his
time
could
have
declared
with
a
very
considerable
confidence
that
given
a
certain
measure
of
persistence
and
social
security
these
things
were
more
likely
to
be
attained
than
not
in
the
course
of
the
next
century
but
such
a
prophecy
was
conditional
on
the
preliminary
accumulation
of
a
considerable
amount
of
knowledge
on
many
experiments
and
failures
had
the
world
of
by
some
wave
of
impulse
placed
all
its
resources
in
the
hands
of
the
ablest
scientific
man
alive
and
asked
him
to
produce
a
practicable
paying
electric
vehicle
before
at
best
he
would
have
produced
some
clumsy
curious
toy
more
probably
he
would
have
failed
altogether
and
similarly
if
the
whole
population
of
the
world
came
to
the
present
writer
and
promised
meekly
to
do
whatever
it
was
told
we
should
find
ourselves
still
very
largely
at
a
loss
in
our
project
for
a
millennium
yet
just
as
nearly
every
man
at
work
upon
voltaic
electricity
in
knew
that
he
was
preparing
for
electric
traction
so
do
i
know
quite
certainly
in
spite
of
a
whole
row
of
unsolved
problems
before
me
that
i
am
working
towards
the
great
state
let
me
briefly
recapitulate
the
main
problems
which
have
to
be
attacked
in
the
attempt
to
realise
the
outline
of
the
great
state
at
the
base
of
the
whole
order
there
must
be
some
method
of
agricultural
production
and
if
the
agricultural
labourer
and
cottager
and
the
ancient
life
of
the
small
householder
on
the
holding
a
life
laborious
prolific
illiterate
limited
and
in
immediate
contact
with
the
land
used
is
to
recede
and
disappear
it
must
recede
and
disappear
before
methods
upon
a
much
larger
scale
employing
wholesale
machinery
and
involving
great
economies
it
is
alleged
by
modern
writers
that
the
permanent
residence
of
the
cultivator
in
close
relation
to
his
ground
is
a
legacy
from
the
days
of
cumbrous
and
expensive
transit
that
the
great
proportion
of
farm
work
is
seasonal
and
that
a
migration
to
and
fro
between
rural
and
urban
conditions
would
be
entirely
practicable
in
a
largely
planned
community
the
agricultural
population
could
move
out
of
town
into
an
life
as
the
spring
approached
and
return
for
spending
pleasure
and
education
as
the
days
shortened
already
something
of
this
sort
occurs
under
extremely
unfavourable
conditions
in
the
movement
of
the
fruit
and
hop
pickers
from
the
east
end
of
london
into
kent
but
that
is
a
mere
hint
of
the
extended
picnic
which
a
broadly
planned
cultivation
might
afford
a
fully
developed
civilisation
employing
machines
in
the
hands
of
highly
skilled
men
will
minimise
toil
to
the
very
utmost
no
man
will
shove
where
a
machine
can
shove
or
carry
where
a
machine
can
carry
but
there
will
remain
more
particularly
in
the
summer
a
vast
amount
of
hand
operations
invigorating
and
even
attractive
to
the
urban
population
given
short
hours
good
pay
and
all
the
jolly
amusement
in
the
evening
camp
that
a
free
happy
and
intelligent
people
will
develop
for
themselves
and
there
will
be
little
difficulty
about
this
particular
class
of
work
to
differentiate
it
from
any
other
sort
of
necessary
labour
one
passes
therefore
with
no
definite
transition
from
the
root
problem
of
agricultural
production
in
the
great
state
to
the
wider
problem
of
labour
in
general
a
glance
at
the
countryside
conjures
up
a
picture
of
extensive
tracts
being
cultivated
on
a
wholesale
scale
of
skilled
men
directing
great
ploughing
sowing
and
reaping
plants
steering
cattle
and
sheep
about
carefully
designed
enclosures
constructing
channels
and
guiding
sewage
towards
its
proper
destination
on
the
fields
and
then
of
added
crowds
of
genial
people
coming
out
to
spray
trees
and
plants
pick
and
sort
and
pack
fruits
but
who
are
these
people
why
are
they
in
particular
doing
this
for
the
community
is
our
great
state
still
to
have
a
majority
of
people
glad
to
do
commonplace
work
for
mediocre
wages
and
will
there
be
other
individuals
who
will
ride
by
on
the
roads
sympathetically
no
doubt
but
with
a
secret
sense
of
superiority
so
one
opens
the
general
problem
of
the
organisation
for
labour
i
am
careful
here
to
write
for
labour
and
not
of
labour
because
it
is
entirely
against
the
spirit
of
the
great
state
that
any
section
of
the
people
should
be
set
aside
as
a
class
to
do
most
of
the
monotonous
laborious
and
uneventful
things
for
the
community
that
is
practically
the
present
arrangement
and
that
with
a
quickened
sense
of
the
need
of
breaking
people
in
to
such
a
life
is
the
ideal
of
the
bureaucratic
servile
state
to
which
in
common
with
the
conservators
we
are
bitterly
opposed
and
here
i
know
i
am
at
my
most
difficult
most
speculative
and
most
revolutionary
point
we
who
look
to
the
great
state
as
the
present
aim
of
human
progress
believe
a
state
may
solve
its
economic
problem
without
any
section
whatever
of
the
community
being
condemned
to
lifelong
labour
and
contemporary
events
the
phenomena
of
recent
strikes
the
phenomena
of
sabotage
carry
out
the
suggestion
that
in
a
community
where
nearly
everyone
reads
extensively
travels
about
sees
the
charm
and
variety
in
the
lives
of
prosperous
and
leisurely
people
no
class
is
going
to
submit
permanently
to
modern
labour
conditions
without
extreme
resistance
even
after
the
most
elaborate
labour
conciliation
schemes
and
social
minima
are
established
things
are
altogether
too
stimulating
to
the
imagination
nowadays
of
all
impossible
social
dreams
that
belief
in
tranquillised
and
submissive
and
virtuous
labour
is
the
wildest
of
all
no
sort
of
modern
men
will
stand
it
they
will
as
a
class
do
any
vivid
and
disastrous
thing
rather
than
stand
it
even
the
illiterate
peasant
will
only
endure
lifelong
toil
under
the
stimulus
of
private
ownership
and
with
the
consolations
of
religion
and
the
typical
modern
worker
has
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
for
a
time
indeed
for
a
generation
or
so
even
a
labour
mass
may
be
fooled
or
coerced
but
in
the
end
it
will
break
out
against
its
subjection
even
if
it
breaks
out
to
a
general
social
catastrophe
we
have
in
fact
to
invent
for
the
great
state
if
we
are
to
suppose
any
great
state
at
all
an
economic
method
without
any
specific
labour
class
if
we
can
not
do
so
we
had
better
throw
ourselves
in
with
the
conservators
forthwith
for
they
are
right
and
we
are
absurd
adhesion
to
the
conception
of
the
great
state
involves
adhesion
to
the
belief
that
the
amount
of
regular
labour
skilled
and
unskilled
required
to
produce
everything
necessary
for
everyone
living
in
its
highly
elaborate
civilisation
may
under
modern
conditions
with
the
help
of
scientific
economy
and
machinery
be
reduced
to
so
small
a
number
of
working
hours
per
head
in
proportion
to
the
average
life
of
the
citizen
as
to
be
met
as
regards
the
greater
moiety
of
it
by
the
payment
of
wages
over
and
above
the
gratuitous
share
of
each
individual
in
the
general
output
and
as
regards
the
residue
a
residue
of
rough
disagreeable
and
monotonous
operations
by
some
form
of
conscription
which
will
demand
a
year
or
so
let
us
say
of
each
person
life
for
the
public
service
if
we
reflect
that
in
the
contemporary
state
there
is
already
food
shelter
and
clothing
of
a
sort
for
everyone
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
enormous
numbers
of
people
do
no
productive
work
at
all
because
they
are
too
well
off
that
great
numbers
are
out
of
work
great
numbers
by
bad
nutrition
and
training
incapable
of
work
and
that
an
enormous
amount
of
the
work
actually
done
is
the
overlapping
production
of
competitive
trade
and
work
upon
such
politically
necessary
but
socially
useless
things
as
dreadnoughts
it
becomes
clear
that
the
absolutely
unavoidable
labour
in
a
modern
community
and
its
ratio
to
the
available
vitality
must
be
of
very
small
account
indeed
but
all
this
has
still
to
be
worked
out
even
in
the
most
general
terms
an
intelligent
science
of
economics
should
afford
standards
and
technicalities
and
systematised
facts
upon
which
to
base
an
estimate
the
point
was
raised
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
by
morris
in
his
news
from
nowhere
and
indeed
it
was
already
discussed
by
more
in
his
utopia
our
contemporary
economics
is
however
still
a
foolish
pretentious
a
festering
mass
of
assumptions
about
buying
and
selling
and
and
one
would
as
soon
consult
bradshaw
or
the
works
of
dumas
as
our
orthodox
professors
of
economics
for
any
light
upon
this
fundamental
matter
moreover
we
believe
that
there
is
a
real
disposition
to
work
in
human
beings
and
that
in
a
community
in
which
no
one
was
under
an
unavoidable
urgency
to
work
the
greater
proportion
of
productive
operations
could
be
made
sufficiently
attractive
to
make
them
desirable
occupations
as
for
the
irreducible
residue
of
undesirable
toil
i
owe
to
my
friend
the
late
professor
william
james
this
suggestion
of
a
general
conscription
and
a
period
of
public
service
for
everyone
a
suggestion
which
greatly
occupied
his
thoughts
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
he
was
profoundly
convinced
of
the
high
educational
and
disciplinary
value
of
universal
compulsory
military
service
and
of
the
need
of
something
more
than
a
sentimental
ideal
of
duty
in
public
life
he
would
have
had
the
whole
population
taught
in
the
schools
and
prepared
for
this
year
or
whatever
period
it
had
to
be
of
patient
and
heroic
labour
the
men
for
the
mines
the
fisheries
the
sanitary
services
railway
routine
the
women
for
hospital
and
perhaps
educational
work
and
so
forth
he
believed
such
a
service
would
permeate
the
whole
state
with
a
sense
of
civic
obligation
but
behind
all
these
conceivable
triumphs
of
scientific
adjustment
and
direction
lies
the
infinitely
greater
difficulty
on
our
way
to
the
great
state
the
difficulty
of
direction
what
sort
of
people
are
going
to
distribute
the
work
of
the
community
decide
what
is
or
is
not
to
be
done
determine
wages
initiate
enterprises
and
under
what
sort
of
criticism
checks
and
controls
are
they
going
to
do
this
delicate
and
extensive
work
with
this
we
open
the
whole
problem
of
government
administration
and
officialdom
the
marxist
and
the
democratic
socialist
generally
shirk
this
riddle
altogether
the
fabian
conception
of
a
bureaucracy
official
to
the
extent
of
being
a
distinct
class
and
cult
exists
only
as
a
for
healthy
repudiations
whatever
else
may
be
worked
out
in
the
subtler
answers
our
later
time
prepares
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
that
the
necessary
machinery
of
government
must
be
elaborately
organised
to
prevent
the
development
of
a
managing
caste
in
permanent
conspiracy
tacit
or
expressed
against
the
normal
man
quite
apart
from
the
danger
of
unsympathetic
and
fatally
irritating
government
there
can
be
little
or
no
doubt
that
the
method
of
making
men
officials
for
life
is
quite
the
worst
way
of
getting
official
duties
done
officialdom
is
a
species
of
incompetence
this
rather
priggish
teachable
and
sort
of
boy
who
is
attracted
by
the
prospect
of
assured
income
and
a
pension
to
win
his
way
into
the
civil
service
and
who
then
by
varied
assiduities
rises
to
a
sort
of
timidly
vindictive
importance
is
the
last
person
to
whom
we
would
willingly
entrust
the
vital
interests
of
a
nation
we
want
people
who
know
about
life
at
large
who
will
come
to
the
public
service
seasoned
by
experience
not
people
who
have
specialised
and
acquired
that
sort
of
knowledge
which
is
called
in
much
the
same
spirit
of
qualification
as
one
speaks
of
german
silver
expert
knowledge
it
is
clear
our
public
servants
and
officials
must
be
so
only
for
their
periods
of
service
they
must
be
taught
by
life
and
not
trained
by
pedagogues
in
every
continuing
job
there
is
a
time
when
one
is
crude
and
blundering
a
time
the
best
time
when
one
is
full
of
the
freshness
and
happiness
of
doing
well
and
a
time
when
routine
has
largely
replaced
the
stimulus
of
novelty
the
great
state
will
i
feel
convinced
regard
changes
in
occupation
as
a
proper
circumstance
in
the
life
of
every
citizen
it
will
value
a
certain
amateurishness
in
its
service
and
prefer
it
to
the
trite
omniscience
of
the
stale
official
on
that
score
of
the
necessity
or
versatility
if
on
no
other
score
i
am
flatly
antagonistic
to
the
conceptions
of
guild
socialism
which
have
arisen
recently
out
of
the
impact
of
penty
and
syndicalism
upon
the
uneasy
intelligence
of
orage
and
since
the
fabian
socialists
have
created
a
widespread
belief
that
in
their
projected
state
every
man
will
be
necessarily
a
public
servant
or
a
public
pupil
because
the
state
will
be
the
only
employer
and
the
only
educator
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
that
the
great
state
presupposes
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
it
is
a
form
of
liberty
and
not
a
form
of
enslavement
we
agree
with
the
older
forms
of
socialism
in
supposing
an
initial
proprietary
independence
in
every
citizen
the
citizen
is
a
shareholder
in
the
state
above
that
and
after
that
he
works
if
he
chooses
but
if
he
likes
to
live
on
his
minimum
and
do
nothing
though
such
a
type
of
character
is
scarcely
conceivable
he
can
his
earning
is
his
own
surplus
above
the
basal
economics
of
the
great
state
we
assume
with
confidence
there
will
be
a
huge
surplus
of
free
spending
upon
ends
public
organisations
for
example
may
distribute
impartially
and
possibly
even
print
and
make
ink
and
paper
for
the
newspapers
in
the
great
state
but
they
will
certainly
not
own
them
only
men
have
ever
ventured
to
think
they
would
nor
will
the
state
control
writers
and
artists
for
example
nor
the
stage
though
it
may
build
and
own
theatres
the
tailor
the
dressmaker
the
restaurant
cook
an
enormous
multitude
of
other
busy
in
the
great
state
of
the
future
as
in
the
life
of
the
more
prosperous
classes
of
the
greater
proportion
of
occupations
and
activities
will
be
private
and
free
i
would
like
to
underline
in
the
most
emphatic
way
that
it
is
possible
to
have
this
great
state
essentially
socialistic
owning
and
running
the
land
and
all
the
great
public
services
sustaining
everybody
in
absolute
freedom
at
a
certain
minimum
of
comfort
and
and
still
leaving
most
of
the
interests
amusements
and
adornments
of
the
individual
life
and
all
sorts
of
collective
concerns
social
and
political
discussion
religious
worship
philosophy
and
the
like
to
the
free
personal
initiatives
of
entirely
unofficial
people
this
still
leaves
the
problem
of
systematic
knowledge
and
research
and
all
the
associated
problems
of
aesthetic
moral
and
intellectual
initiative
to
be
worked
out
in
detail
but
at
least
it
dispels
the
nightmare
of
a
collective
mind
organised
as
a
branch
of
the
civil
service
with
authors
critics
artists
scientific
investigators
appointed
in
a
phrensy
of
as
nowadays
the
british
state
appoints
its
bishops
for
the
care
of
its
collective
soul
let
me
now
indicate
how
these
general
views
affect
the
problem
of
family
organisation
and
the
problem
of
women
freedom
in
the
normal
social
life
the
position
of
women
is
easily
defined
they
are
subordinated
but
important
the
citizenship
rests
with
the
man
and
the
woman
relation
to
the
community
as
a
whole
is
through
a
man
but
within
that
limitation
her
functions
as
mother
wife
and
are
cardinal
it
is
one
of
the
entirely
unforeseen
consequences
that
have
arisen
from
the
decay
of
the
normal
social
life
and
its
autonomous
home
that
great
numbers
of
women
while
still
subordinate
have
become
profoundly
unimportant
they
have
ceased
to
a
very
large
extent
to
bear
children
they
have
dropped
most
of
their
arts
they
no
longer
nurse
nor
educate
such
children
as
they
have
and
they
have
taken
on
no
new
functions
that
compensate
for
these
dwindling
activities
of
the
domestic
interior
that
subjugation
which
is
a
vital
condition
to
the
normal
social
life
does
not
seem
to
be
necessary
to
the
great
state
it
may
or
it
may
not
be
necessary
and
here
we
enter
upon
the
most
difficult
of
all
our
problems
the
whole
spirit
of
the
great
state
is
against
any
avoidable
subjugation
but
the
whole
spirit
of
that
science
which
will
animate
the
great
state
forbids
us
to
ignore
woman
functional
and
temperamental
differences
a
new
status
has
still
to
be
invented
for
women
a
feminine
citizenship
differing
in
certain
respects
from
the
normal
masculine
citizenship
its
conditions
remain
to
be
worked
out
we
have
indeed
to
work
out
an
entire
new
system
of
relations
between
men
and
women
that
will
be
free
from
servitude
aggression
provocation
or
parasitism
the
public
endowment
of
motherhood
as
such
may
perhaps
be
the
first
broad
suggestion
of
the
quality
of
this
new
status
a
new
type
of
family
a
mutual
alliance
in
the
place
of
a
subjugation
is
perhaps
the
most
startling
of
all
the
conceptions
which
confront
us
directly
we
turn
ourselves
definitely
towards
the
great
state
and
as
our
conception
of
the
great
state
grows
so
we
shall
begin
to
realise
the
nature
of
the
problem
of
transition
the
problem
of
what
we
may
best
do
in
the
confusion
of
the
present
time
to
elucidate
and
render
practicable
this
new
phase
of
human
organisation
of
one
thing
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
whatever
increases
thought
and
knowledge
moves
towards
our
goal
and
equally
certain
is
it
that
nothing
leads
thither
that
tampers
with
the
freedom
of
spirit
the
independence
of
soul
in
common
men
and
women
in
many
directions
therefore
the
believer
in
the
great
state
will
display
a
jealous
watchfulness
of
contemporary
developments
rather
than
a
premature
constructiveness
we
must
watch
wealth
but
quite
as
necessary
it
is
to
watch
the
legislator
who
mistakes
propaganda
for
progress
and
class
exasperation
to
satisfy
class
vindictiveness
for
construction
supremely
important
is
it
to
keep
discussion
open
to
tolerate
no
limitation
on
the
freedom
of
speech
writing
art
and
book
distribution
and
to
sustain
the
utmost
liberty
of
criticism
upon
all
contemporary
institutions
and
processes
this
briefly
is
the
programme
of
problems
and
effort
to
which
my
idea
of
the
great
state
as
the
goal
of
contemporary
progress
leads
me
the
diagram
on
shows
compactly
the
gist
of
the
preceding
discussion
it
gives
the
view
of
social
development
upon
which
i
base
all
my
political
conceptions
the
normal
social
life
produces
an
increasing
surplus
of
energy
and
opportunity
more
particularly
under
modern
conditions
of
scientific
organisation
and
power
production
and
this
through
the
operation
of
rent
and
of
usury
tends
to
a
release
and
b
expropriate
an
increasing
proportion
of
the
population
to
become
a
leisure
class
and
a
labour
class
under
no
urgent
compulsion
divorced
from
the
land
and
to
work
living
upon
uncertain
wages
which
may
degenerate
degenerate
into
a
waster
class
into
a
sweated
overworked
violently
resentful
and
destructive
rebel
class
and
produce
a
social
debacle
which
may
become
which
may
become
a
governing
the
controlled
class
with
waster
regimented
elements
in
and
disciplined
an
unprogressive
labour
class
of
bureaucratic
an
unprogressive
servile
state
bureaucratic
servile
state
which
may
become
which
may
be
the
whole
community
rendered
needless
of
the
great
state
by
a
universal
working
under
various
compulsory
year
motives
and
inducements
or
so
of
labour
but
not
constantly
service
together
nor
permanently
with
a
scientific
nor
unwillingly
organisation
of
production
and
so
reabsorbed
by
into
the
leisure
class
of
the
great
state
the
common
sense
of
warfare
sec
conscription
i
want
to
say
as
compactly
as
possible
why
i
do
not
believe
that
conscription
would
increase
the
military
efficiency
of
this
country
and
why
i
think
it
might
be
a
disastrous
step
for
this
country
to
take
by
conscription
i
mean
the
compulsory
enlistment
for
a
term
of
service
in
the
army
of
the
whole
manhood
of
the
country
and
i
am
writing
now
from
the
point
of
view
merely
of
military
effectiveness
the
educational
value
of
a
universal
national
service
the
idea
which
as
a
socialist
i
support
very
heartily
of
making
every
citizen
give
a
year
or
so
of
his
life
to
our
public
needs
are
matters
quite
outside
my
present
discussion
what
i
am
writing
about
now
is
this
idea
that
the
country
can
be
strengthened
for
war
by
making
every
man
in
it
a
bit
of
a
soldier
and
i
want
the
reader
to
be
perfectly
clear
about
the
position
i
assume
with
regard
to
war
preparations
generally
i
am
not
pleading
for
peace
when
there
is
no
peace
this
country
has
been
constantly
threatened
during
the
past
decade
and
is
threatened
now
by
gigantic
hostile
preparations
it
is
our
common
interest
to
be
and
to
keep
at
the
maximum
of
military
efficiency
possible
to
us
my
case
is
not
merely
that
conscription
will
not
contribute
to
that
but
that
it
would
be
a
monstrous
diversion
of
our
energy
and
emotion
and
material
resources
from
the
things
that
need
urgently
to
be
done
it
would
be
like
a
boxer
filling
his
arms
with
empty
and
then
rushing
his
face
protruding
over
the
armful
into
the
fray
let
me
make
my
attack
on
this
prevalent
and
increasing
superstition
of
the
british
need
for
conscription
in
two
lines
one
following
the
other
for
firstly
it
is
true
that
britain
at
the
present
time
is
no
more
capable
of
creating
such
a
conscript
army
as
france
or
germany
possesses
in
the
next
ten
years
than
she
is
of
covering
her
soil
with
a
tropical
forest
and
secondly
it
is
equally
true
that
if
she
had
such
an
army
it
would
not
be
of
the
slightest
use
to
her
for
the
conscript
armies
in
which
europe
still
so
largely
believes
are
only
of
use
against
conscript
armies
and
adversaries
who
will
consent
to
play
the
rules
of
the
german
war
game
they
are
if
we
chose
to
determine
they
shall
be
if
we
chose
to
deal
with
them
as
they
should
be
dealt
with
as
out
of
date
as
a
roman
legion
or
a
zulu
impi
now
first
as
to
the
impossibility
of
getting
our
great
army
into
existence
all
those
people
who
write
and
talk
so
glibly
in
favour
of
conscription
seem
to
forget
that
to
take
a
common
man
and
more
particularly
a
townsman
clap
him
into
a
uniform
and
put
a
rifle
in
his
hand
does
not
make
a
soldier
he
has
to
be
taught
not
only
the
use
of
his
weapons
but
the
methods
of
a
strange
and
unfamiliar
life
out
of
doors
he
has
to
be
not
simply
drilled
but
accustomed
to
the
difficult
modern
necessities
of
open
order
fighting
of
taking
cover
of
entrenchment
and
he
has
to
have
created
within
him
so
that
it
will
stand
the
shock
of
seeing
men
killed
round
about
him
confidence
in
himself
in
his
officers
and
the
methods
and
weapons
of
his
side
body
mind
and
imagination
have
all
to
be
trained
and
they
need
trainers
the
conversion
of
a
thousand
citizens
into
anything
better
than
a
militia
demands
the
enthusiastic
services
of
scores
of
able
and
experienced
instructors
who
know
what
war
is
the
creation
of
a
universal
army
demands
the
services
of
many
scores
of
thousands
of
not
simply
old
soldiers
but
keen
expert
without
these
officers
our
citizen
army
would
be
a
hydra
without
heads
and
we
have
these
officers
we
have
a
tithe
of
them
we
have
these
officers
and
we
ca
make
them
in
a
hurry
it
takes
at
least
five
years
to
make
an
officer
who
knows
his
trade
it
needs
a
special
gift
in
addition
to
that
knowledge
to
make
a
man
able
to
impart
it
and
our
empire
is
at
a
peculiar
disadvantage
in
the
matter
because
india
and
our
other
vast
areas
of
service
and
opportunity
overseas
drain
away
a
large
proportion
of
just
those
able
and
educated
men
who
would
in
other
countries
gravitate
towards
the
army
such
small
wealth
of
officers
as
we
have
and
i
am
quite
prepared
to
believe
that
the
officers
we
have
are
among
the
very
best
in
the
world
are
scarcely
enough
to
go
round
our
present
supply
of
private
soldiers
and
the
best
and
most
brilliant
among
this
scanty
supply
are
being
drawn
upon
more
and
more
for
aerial
work
and
for
all
that
increasing
quantity
of
highly
specialised
services
which
are
manifestly
destined
to
be
the
real
fighting
forces
of
the
future
we
can
not
spare
the
best
of
our
officers
for
training
conscripts
we
shall
get
the
dismallest
results
from
the
worst
of
them
and
so
even
if
it
were
a
vital
necessity
for
our
country
to
have
an
army
of
all
its
manhood
now
we
could
not
have
it
and
it
would
be
a
mere
last
convulsion
to
attempt
to
make
it
with
the
means
at
our
disposal
but
that
brings
me
to
my
second
contention
which
is
that
we
do
not
want
such
an
army
i
believe
that
the
vast
masses
of
men
in
uniform
maintained
by
the
continental
powers
at
the
present
time
are
enormously
overrated
as
fighting
machines
i
see
germany
in
the
likeness
of
a
boxer
with
a
mailed
fist
as
big
as
and
rather
heavier
than
its
body
and
i
am
convinced
that
when
the
moment
comes
for
that
mailed
fist
to
be
lifted
the
whole
disproportionate
system
will
topple
over
the
military
ascendancy
of
the
future
lies
with
the
country
that
dares
to
experiment
most
that
experiments
best
and
meanwhile
keeps
its
actual
fighting
force
fit
and
admirable
and
small
and
flexible
the
experience
of
war
during
the
last
fifteen
years
has
been
to
show
repeatedly
the
enormous
defensive
power
of
small
scientifically
handled
bodies
of
men
these
huge
conscript
armies
are
made
up
not
of
masses
of
military
muscle
but
of
a
huge
proportion
of
military
fat
their
one
way
of
fighting
will
be
to
fall
upon
an
antagonist
with
all
their
available
weight
and
if
he
is
mobile
and
dexterous
enough
to
decline
that
issue
of
adiposity
they
will
become
a
mere
embarrassment
to
their
own
people
modern
weapons
and
modern
contrivance
are
continually
decreasing
the
number
of
men
who
can
be
employed
efficiently
upon
a
length
of
front
i
doubt
if
there
is
any
use
for
more
than
men
upon
the
whole
frontier
at
the
present
time
such
an
army
properly
supplied
could
so
far
as
terrestrial
forces
are
concerned
hold
that
frontier
against
any
number
of
assailants
the
bigger
the
forces
brought
against
it
the
sooner
the
exhaustion
of
the
attacking
power
now
it
is
for
employment
upon
that
frontier
and
for
no
other
conceivable
purpose
in
the
world
that
great
britain
is
asked
to
create
a
gigantic
conscript
army
and
if
too
big
an
army
is
likely
to
be
a
mere
encumbrance
in
war
it
is
perhaps
even
a
still
graver
blunder
to
maintain
one
during
that
conflict
of
preparation
which
is
at
present
the
european
substitute
for
actual
hostilities
it
consumes
it
produces
nothing
it
not
only
eats
and
drinks
and
wears
out
its
clothes
and
withdraws
men
from
industry
but
under
the
stress
of
invention
it
needs
constantly
to
be
and
freshly
equipped
at
an
expenditure
proportionate
to
its
size
so
long
as
the
conflict
of
preparation
goes
on
then
the
bigger
the
army
your
adversary
maintains
under
arms
the
bigger
is
his
expenditure
and
the
less
his
earning
power
the
less
the
force
you
employ
to
keep
your
adversary
and
the
longer
you
remain
at
peace
with
him
while
he
is
the
greater
is
your
advantage
there
is
only
one
profitable
use
for
any
army
and
that
is
victorious
conflict
every
army
that
is
not
engaged
in
victorious
conflict
is
an
organ
of
national
expenditure
an
exhausting
growth
in
the
national
body
and
for
great
britain
an
attempt
to
create
a
conscript
army
would
involve
the
very
maximum
of
moral
and
material
exhaustion
with
the
minimum
of
military
efficiency
it
would
be
a
disastrous
waste
of
resources
that
we
need
most
urgently
for
other
things
sec
in
the
popular
imagination
the
dreadnought
is
still
the
one
instrument
of
naval
war
we
count
our
strength
in
dreadnoughts
and
and
so
long
as
we
are
spending
our
national
resources
upon
them
faster
than
any
other
country
if
we
sink
at
least
for
every
sunk
in
these
obsolescent
monsters
by
germany
we
have
a
reassuring
sense
of
keeping
ahead
and
being
thoroughly
safe
this
confidence
in
big
very
expensive
battleships
is
i
believe
and
hope
shared
by
the
german
government
and
by
europe
generally
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
very
unreasonable
confidence
and
it
may
easily
lead
us
into
the
most
tragic
of
national
disillusionments
we
of
the
general
public
are
led
to
suppose
that
the
next
naval
war
if
ever
we
engage
in
another
naval
war
will
begin
with
a
decisive
fleet
action
the
plan
of
action
is
presented
with
an
alluring
simplicity
our
adversary
will
come
out
to
us
in
a
ratio
of
to
or
in
some
ratio
still
more
advantageous
to
us
according
as
our
adversary
happens
to
be
this
power
or
that
power
there
will
be
some
tremendous
business
with
guns
and
torpedoes
and
our
admirals
will
return
victorious
to
discuss
the
discipline
and
details
of
the
battle
and
each
other
little
weaknesses
in
the
monthly
magazines
this
is
a
desirable
but
improbable
anticipation
no
hostile
power
is
in
the
least
likely
to
send
out
any
battleships
at
all
against
our
invincible
dreadnoughts
they
will
promenade
the
seas
always
in
the
ratio
of
or
more
to
looking
for
fleets
securely
tucked
away
out
of
reach
they
will
not
of
course
go
too
near
the
enemy
coast
on
account
of
mines
and
meanwhile
our
cruisers
will
hunt
the
enemy
commerce
into
port
then
other
things
will
happen
the
enemy
we
shall
discover
using
unsportsmanlike
devices
against
our
capital
ships
unless
he
is
a
lunatic
he
will
prove
to
be
much
stronger
in
reality
than
he
is
on
paper
in
the
matter
of
submarines
waterplanes
and
aeroplanes
these
are
things
cheap
to
make
and
easy
to
conceal
he
will
be
richly
stocked
with
ingenious
devices
for
getting
explosives
up
to
these
two
million
pound
triumphs
of
our
naval
engineering
on
the
cloudy
and
foggy
nights
so
frequent
about
these
islands
he
will
have
extraordinary
chances
and
sooner
or
later
unless
we
beat
him
thoroughly
in
the
air
above
and
in
the
waters
beneath
for
neither
of
which
proceedings
we
are
prepared
some
of
these
chances
will
come
off
and
we
shall
lose
a
dreadnought
it
will
be
a
poor
consolation
if
an
and
stranded
zeppelin
or
so
enlivens
the
quiet
of
the
english
countryside
by
coming
down
and
capitulating
it
will
be
a
trifling
countershock
to
wing
an
aeroplane
or
so
or
blow
a
out
of
the
water
our
dreadnoughts
will
cease
to
be
a
source
of
unmitigated
confidence
a
second
battleship
disaster
will
excite
the
press
extremely
a
third
will
probably
lead
to
a
retirement
of
the
battle
fleet
to
some
east
coast
harbour
a
refuge
liable
to
aeroplanes
or
to
the
west
coast
of
ireland
and
the
real
naval
war
which
as
i
have
argued
in
an
earlier
chapter
will
be
a
war
of
destroyers
submarines
and
hydroplanes
will
begin
incidentally
a
commerce
destroyer
may
take
advantage
of
the
retirement
of
our
fleet
to
raid
our
trade
routes
we
shall
then
realise
that
the
actual
naval
weapons
are
these
smaller
weapons
and
especially
the
destroyer
the
submarine
and
the
waterplane
the
waterplane
most
of
all
because
of
its
possibilities
of
a
comparative
bigness
in
the
hands
of
competent
and
daring
men
and
i
find
myself
as
a
patriotic
englishman
more
and
more
troubled
by
doubts
whether
we
are
as
certainly
superior
to
any
possible
adversary
in
these
essential
things
as
we
are
in
the
matter
of
dreadnoughts
i
find
myself
awake
at
nights
after
a
day
much
agitated
by
a
belligerent
press
wondering
whether
the
real
empire
of
the
sea
may
not
even
now
have
slipped
out
of
our
hands
while
our
attention
has
been
fixed
on
our
stately
procession
of
giant
warships
while
our
country
has
been
in
a
dream
hypnotised
by
the
dreadnought
idea
for
some
years
there
seems
to
have
been
a
complete
arrest
of
the
british
imagination
in
naval
and
military
matters
that
declining
faculty
never
a
very
active
or
one
staggered
up
to
the
conception
of
a
dreadnought
and
seems
now
to
have
sat
down
for
good
its
reply
to
every
demand
upon
it
has
been
more
dreadnoughts
the
future
as
we
british
seem
to
see
it
is
an
avenue
of
dreadnoughts
and
and
getting
bigger
and
bigger
in
a
kind
of
inverted
perspective
but
the
ascendancy
of
fleets
of
great
battleships
in
naval
warfare
like
the
phase
of
huge
conscript
armies
upon
land
draws
to
its
close
the
progress
of
invention
makes
both
the
big
ship
and
the
army
crowd
more
and
more
vulnerable
and
less
and
less
effective
a
new
phase
of
warfare
opens
beyond
the
vista
of
our
current
programmes
smaller
more
numerous
and
various
and
mobile
weapons
and
craft
and
contrivances
manned
by
daring
and
highly
skilled
men
must
ultimately
take
the
place
of
those
massivenesses
we
are
entering
upon
a
period
in
which
the
invention
of
methods
and
material
for
war
is
likely
to
be
more
rapid
and
diversified
than
it
has
ever
been
before
and
the
question
of
what
we
have
been
doing
behind
the
splendid
line
of
our
dreadnoughts
to
meet
the
demands
of
this
new
phase
is
one
of
supreme
importance
knowing
as
i
do
the
imaginative
indolence
of
my
countrymen
it
is
a
question
i
face
with
something
very
near
to
dismay
but
it
is
one
that
has
to
be
faced
the
question
that
should
occupy
our
directing
minds
now
is
no
longer
how
can
we
get
more
dreadnoughts
but
what
have
we
to
follow
the
dreadnought
to
the
power
that
has
most
nearly
guessed
the
answer
to
that
riddle
belongs
the
future
empire
of
the
seas
it
is
interesting
to
guess
for
oneself
and
to
speculate
upon
the
possibility
of
a
kind
of
armoured
for
waterplanes
and
submarines
and
torpedo
craft
but
necessarily
that
would
be
a
mere
journalistic
and
amateurish
guessing
i
am
not
guessing
but
asking
urgent
questions
what
force
what
council
how
many
imaginative
and
inventive
men
has
the
country
got
at
the
present
time
employed
not
casually
but
professionally
in
anticipating
the
new
strategy
the
new
tactics
the
new
material
the
new
training
that
invention
is
so
rapidly
rendering
necessary
i
have
the
gravest
doubts
whether
we
are
doing
anything
systematic
at
all
in
this
way
now
it
is
the
tremendous
seriousness
of
this
deficiency
to
which
i
want
to
call
attention
great
britain
has
in
her
armour
a
gap
more
dangerous
and
vital
than
any
mere
numerical
insufficiency
of
men
or
ships
she
is
short
of
minds
behind
its
strength
of
current
armaments
a
strength
that
begins
to
evaporate
and
grow
obsolete
from
the
very
moment
it
comes
into
being
a
country
needs
more
and
more
this
profounder
strength
of
intellectual
and
creative
activity
this
country
most
of
all
which
was
left
so
far
behind
in
the
production
of
submarines
airships
and
aeroplanes
must
be
made
to
realise
the
folly
of
its
trust
in
established
things
each
new
thing
we
take
up
more
belatedly
and
reluctantly
than
its
predecessor
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
we
shall
be
caught
lagging
unless
we
change
all
this
we
need
a
new
arm
to
our
service
we
need
it
urgently
and
we
shall
need
it
more
and
more
and
that
arm
is
research
we
need
to
place
inquiry
and
experiment
upon
a
new
footing
altogether
to
enlist
for
them
and
organise
them
to
secure
the
pick
of
our
young
chemists
and
physicists
and
engineers
and
to
get
them
to
work
systematically
upon
the
anticipation
and
preparation
of
our
future
war
equipment
we
need
a
service
of
invention
to
recover
our
lost
lead
in
these
matters
and
it
is
because
i
feel
so
keenly
the
want
of
such
a
service
and
the
want
of
great
sums
of
money
for
it
that
i
deplore
the
disposition
to
waste
millions
upon
the
hasty
creation
of
a
universal
service
army
and
upon
excessive
dreadnoughting
i
am
convinced
that
we
are
spending
upon
the
things
of
yesterday
the
money
that
is
sorely
needed
for
the
things
of
with
our
eyes
averted
obstinately
from
the
future
we
are
backing
towards
disaster
sec
in
the
present
armament
competition
there
are
certain
considerations
that
appear
to
be
almost
universally
overlooked
and
which
tend
to
modify
our
views
profoundly
of
what
should
be
done
ultimately
they
will
affect
our
entire
expenditure
upon
war
preparation
expenditure
upon
preparation
for
war
falls
roughly
into
two
classes
there
is
expenditure
upon
things
that
have
a
diminishing
value
things
that
grow
and
wear
out
such
as
fortifications
ships
guns
and
ammunition
and
expenditure
upon
things
that
have
a
permanent
and
even
growing
value
such
as
organised
technical
research
military
and
naval
experiment
and
the
education
and
increase
of
a
highly
trained
class
of
war
experts
i
want
to
suggest
that
we
are
spending
too
much
money
in
the
former
and
not
enough
in
the
latter
direction
we
are
buying
enormous
quantities
of
stuff
that
will
be
old
iron
in
twenty
years
time
and
we
are
starving
ourselves
of
that
which
can
not
be
bought
or
made
in
a
hurry
and
upon
which
the
strength
of
nations
ultimately
rests
altogether
we
are
failing
to
get
and
maintain
a
sufficiency
of
highly
educated
and
developed
men
inspired
by
a
tradition
of
service
and
efficiency
no
doubt
we
must
be
armed
but
every
penny
we
divert
from
and
to
armament
beyond
the
margin
of
bare
safety
is
a
sacrifice
of
the
future
to
the
present
every
penny
we
divert
from
national
to
national
weapons
means
so
much
less
in
resources
so
much
more
strain
in
the
years
ahead
but
a
great
system
of
laboratories
and
experimental
stations
a
systematic
industrious
increase
of
men
of
the
type
of
the
research
student
type
of
the
engineer
type
of
the
type
of
the
skilled
type
a
methodical
development
of
a
common
sentiment
and
a
common
zeal
among
such
a
body
of
men
is
an
added
strength
that
grows
greater
from
the
moment
you
call
it
into
being
in
our
schools
and
military
and
naval
colleges
lies
the
proper
field
for
expenditure
upon
preparation
for
our
ultimate
triumph
in
war
all
other
war
preparation
is
temporary
but
that
this
would
be
obvious
in
any
case
but
what
makes
insistence
upon
it
peculiarly
urgent
is
the
manifestly
temporary
nature
of
the
present
european
situation
and
the
fact
that
within
quite
a
small
number
of
years
our
war
front
will
be
turned
in
a
direction
quite
other
than
that
to
which
it
faces
now
for
a
decade
and
more
all
western
europe
has
been
threatened
by
german
truculence
the
german
inflamed
by
the
victories
of
and
has
poured
out
his
energy
in
preparation
for
war
by
sea
and
land
and
it
has
been
the
difficult
task
of
france
and
england
to
keep
the
peace
with
him
the
german
has
been
the
provocator
and
leader
of
all
modern
armaments
but
that
is
not
going
on
it
is
already
more
than
half
over
if
we
can
avert
war
with
germany
for
twenty
years
we
shall
never
have
to
fight
germany
in
twenty
years
time
we
shall
be
talking
no
more
of
sending
troops
to
fight
side
by
side
on
the
frontier
of
france
we
shall
be
talking
of
sending
troops
to
fight
side
by
side
with
french
and
germans
on
the
frontiers
of
poland
and
the
justification
of
that
prophecy
is
a
perfectly
plain
one
the
german
has
filled
up
his
country
his
falls
and
the
very
vigour
of
his
military
and
naval
preparations
by
raising
the
cost
of
living
hurries
it
down
his
falls
as
ours
and
the
frenchman
falls
because
he
is
nearing
his
maximum
of
population
it
is
an
inevitable
consequence
of
his
geographical
conditions
but
eastward
of
him
from
his
eastern
boundaries
to
the
pacific
is
a
country
already
too
populous
to
conquer
but
with
possibilities
of
further
expansion
that
are
gigantic
the
slav
will
be
free
to
increase
and
multiply
for
another
hundred
years
eastward
and
southward
bristle
the
slavs
and
behind
the
slavs
are
the
colossal
possibilities
of
asia
even
german
vanity
even
the
preposterous
ambitions
that
spring
from
that
brief
triumph
of
sedan
must
awaken
at
last
to
these
manifest
facts
and
on
the
day
when
germany
is
fully
awake
we
may
count
the
western
european
armageddon
as
off
and
turn
our
eyes
to
the
greater
needs
that
will
arise
beyond
germany
the
old
game
will
be
over
and
a
quite
different
new
game
will
begin
in
international
relations
during
these
last
few
years
of
worry
and
bluster
across
the
north
sea
we
have
a
little
forgotten
india
in
our
calculations
as
germany
faces
round
eastward
again
as
she
must
do
before
very
long
we
shall
find
india
resuming
its
former
central
position
in
our
ideas
of
international
politics
with
india
we
may
pursue
one
of
two
policies
we
may
keep
her
divided
and
inefficient
for
war
as
she
is
at
present
and
hold
her
and
own
her
and
defend
her
as
a
prize
or
we
may
arm
her
and
assist
her
development
into
a
group
of
states
in
which
case
she
will
become
our
partner
and
possibly
at
last
even
our
senior
partner
but
that
is
by
the
way
what
i
am
pointing
out
now
is
that
whether
we
fight
germany
or
not
a
time
is
drawing
near
when
germany
will
cease
to
be
our
war
objective
and
we
shall
cease
to
be
germany
war
objective
and
when
there
will
have
to
be
a
complete
revision
of
our
military
and
naval
equipment
in
relation
to
those
remoter
vaster
asiatic
possibilities
now
that
possible
campaign
away
there
whatever
its
particular
nature
may
be
which
will
be
shaping
our
military
and
naval
policy
in
the
year
or
thereabouts
will
certainly
be
quite
different
in
its
conditions
from
the
possible
campaign
in
europe
and
the
narrow
seas
which
determines
all
our
preparations
now
we
can
not
contemplate
throwing
an
army
of
a
million
british
conscripts
on
to
the
frontier
of
india
and
a
fleet
of
will
be
ineffective
either
in
thibet
or
the
baltic
shallows
all
our
present
stuff
indeed
will
be
on
the
then
what
will
not
be
on
the
will
be
such
enterprise
and
special
science
and
inventive
power
as
we
have
got
together
that
is
versatile
that
is
good
to
have
now
and
that
will
be
good
to
have
then
everyone
nowadays
seems
demanding
increased
expenditure
upon
war
preparation
i
will
follow
the
fashion
i
will
suggest
that
we
have
the
courage
to
restrain
and
even
to
curtail
our
monstrous
outlay
upon
war
material
and
that
we
begin
to
spend
lavishly
upon
military
and
naval
education
and
training
upon
laboratories
and
experimental
stations
upon
chemical
and
physical
research
and
all
that
makes
knowledge
and
leading
and
that
we
increase
our
expenditure
upon
these
things
as
fast
as
we
can
up
to
ten
or
twelve
millions
a
year
at
present
we
spend
about
eighteen
and
a
half
millions
a
year
upon
education
out
of
our
national
funds
but
fourteen
and
a
half
of
this
supplemented
by
about
as
much
again
from
local
sources
is
consumed
in
merely
elementary
teaching
so
that
we
spend
only
about
four
millions
a
year
of
public
money
on
every
sort
of
research
and
education
above
the
simple
democratic
level
nearly
thirty
millions
for
the
foundations
and
only
a
seventh
for
the
edifice
of
will
and
science
is
it
any
marvel
that
we
are
a
badly
organised
nation
a
nation
of
very
widely
diffused
intelligence
and
very
guidance
and
achievement
is
it
any
marvel
that
directly
we
are
tested
by
such
a
new
development
as
that
of
aeroplanes
or
airships
we
show
ourselves
in
comparison
with
the
more
nations
of
the
continent
backward
unorganised
unimaginative
unenterprising
our
supreme
want
if
we
are
to
continue
a
belligerent
people
is
a
greater
supply
of
able
educated
men
versatile
men
capable
of
engines
of
aviation
of
invention
of
leading
and
initiative
we
need
more
laboratories
more
scholarships
out
of
the
general
mass
of
elementary
scholars
a
discipline
in
our
colleges
and
a
great
array
of
new
colleges
a
much
readier
access
to
instruction
in
aviation
and
military
and
naval
practice
and
if
we
are
to
have
national
service
let
us
begin
with
it
where
it
is
needed
most
and
where
it
is
least
likely
to
disorganise
our
social
and
economic
life
let
us
begin
at
the
top
let
us
begin
with
the
educated
and
propertied
classes
and
exact
a
couple
of
years
service
in
a
destroyer
or
a
waterplane
or
an
airship
or
a
research
laboratory
or
a
training
camp
from
the
sons
of
everybody
who
let
us
say
pays
income
tax
without
deductions
let
us
mix
with
these
a
big
proportion
a
proportion
we
may
increase
steadily
of
keen
scholarship
men
from
the
elementary
schools
such
a
class
as
we
should
create
in
this
way
would
give
us
the
realities
of
military
power
which
are
enterprise
knowledge
and
invention
and
at
the
same
time
it
would
add
to
and
not
subtract
from
the
economic
wealth
of
the
community
make
men
that
is
the
only
sane
permanent
preparation
for
war
so
we
should
develop
a
strength
and
create
a
tradition
that
would
not
rust
nor
grow
in
all
the
years
to
come
the
contemporary
novel
circumstances
have
made
me
think
a
good
deal
at
different
times
about
the
business
of
writing
novels
and
what
it
means
and
is
and
may
be
and
i
was
a
professional
critic
of
novels
long
before
i
wrote
them
i
have
been
writing
novels
or
writing
about
novels
for
the
last
twenty
years
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
i
wrote
a
review
the
first
long
and
appreciative
review
he
had
of
joseph
conrad
almayer
folly
in
the
when
a
man
has
focussed
so
much
of
his
life
upon
the
novel
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
him
to
take
too
modest
or
apologetic
a
view
of
it
i
consider
the
novel
an
important
and
necessary
thing
indeed
in
that
complicated
system
of
uneasy
adjustments
and
readjustments
which
is
modern
civilisation
i
make
very
high
and
wide
claims
for
it
in
many
directions
i
do
not
think
we
can
get
along
without
it
now
this
i
know
is
not
the
usually
received
opinion
there
is
i
am
aware
the
theory
that
the
novel
is
wholly
and
solely
a
means
of
relaxation
in
spite
of
manifest
facts
that
was
the
dominant
view
of
the
great
period
that
we
now
in
our
retrospective
way
speak
of
as
the
victorian
and
it
still
survives
to
this
day
it
is
the
man
theory
of
the
novel
rather
than
the
woman
one
may
call
it
the
weary
giant
theory
the
reader
is
represented
as
a
man
burthened
toiling
worn
he
has
been
in
his
office
from
ten
to
four
with
perhaps
only
two
interval
at
his
club
for
lunch
or
he
has
been
playing
golf
or
he
has
been
waiting
about
and
voting
in
the
house
or
he
has
been
fishing
or
he
has
been
disputing
a
point
of
law
or
writing
a
sermon
or
doing
one
of
a
thousand
other
of
the
grave
important
things
which
constitute
the
substance
of
a
prosperous
man
life
now
at
last
comes
the
little
precious
interval
of
leisure
and
the
weary
giant
takes
up
a
book
perhaps
he
is
vexed
he
may
have
been
bunkered
his
line
may
have
been
entangled
in
the
trees
his
favourite
investment
may
have
slumped
or
the
judge
have
had
indigestion
and
been
extremely
rude
to
him
he
wants
to
forget
the
troublesome
realities
of
life
he
wants
to
be
taken
out
of
himself
to
be
cheered
consoled
amused
above
all
amused
he
want
ideas
he
does
want
facts
above
all
he
want
he
wants
to
dream
of
the
bright
thin
gay
excitements
of
a
phantom
world
in
which
he
can
be
hero
of
horses
ridden
and
lace
worn
and
princesses
rescued
and
won
he
wants
pictures
of
funny
slums
and
entertaining
paupers
and
laughable
longshoremen
and
kindly
impulses
making
life
sweet
he
wants
romance
without
its
defiance
and
humour
without
its
sting
and
the
business
of
the
novelist
he
holds
is
to
supply
this
cooling
refreshment
that
is
the
weary
giant
theory
of
the
novel
it
ruled
british
criticism
up
to
the
period
of
the
boer
war
and
then
something
happened
to
quite
a
lot
of
us
and
it
has
never
completely
recovered
its
old
predominance
perhaps
it
will
perhaps
something
else
may
happen
to
prevent
its
ever
doing
so
both
fiction
and
criticism
are
in
revolt
against
that
tired
giant
the
prosperous
englishman
i
can
not
think
of
a
single
writer
of
any
distinction
unless
it
is
jacobs
who
is
content
merely
to
serve
the
purpose
of
those
slippered
hours
so
far
from
the
weary
reader
being
a
decently
tired
giant
we
realise
that
he
is
only
an
inexpressibly
lax
slovenly
and
giant
and
we
are
all
out
with
one
accord
resolved
to
exercise
his
higher
ganglia
in
every
possible
way
and
so
i
will
say
no
more
of
the
idea
that
the
novel
is
merely
a
harmless
opiate
for
the
vacant
hours
of
prosperous
men
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
never
has
been
and
by
its
nature
i
doubt
if
it
ever
can
be
i
do
not
think
that
women
have
ever
quite
succumbed
to
the
tired
giant
attitude
in
their
reading
women
are
more
serious
not
only
about
life
but
about
books
no
type
or
kind
of
woman
is
capable
of
that
lounging
defensive
stupidity
which
is
the
basis
of
the
tired
giant
attitude
and
all
through
the
early
during
which
the
respectable
frivolity
of
great
britain
left
its
most
enduring
marks
upon
our
literature
there
was
a
rebel
undertow
of
earnest
and
aggressive
writing
and
reading
supported
chiefly
by
women
and
supplied
very
largely
by
women
which
gave
the
lie
to
the
prevailing
trivial
estimate
of
fiction
among
readers
women
and
girls
and
young
men
at
least
will
insist
upon
having
their
novels
significant
and
real
and
it
is
to
these
perpetually
renewed
elements
in
the
public
that
the
novelist
must
look
for
his
continuing
emancipation
from
the
wearier
and
more
massive
influences
at
work
in
contemporary
british
life
and
if
the
novel
is
to
be
recognised
as
something
more
than
a
relaxation
it
has
also
i
think
to
be
kept
free
from
the
restrictions
imposed
upon
it
by
the
fierce
pedantries
of
those
who
would
define
a
general
form
for
it
every
art
nowadays
must
steer
its
way
between
the
rocks
of
trivial
and
degrading
standards
and
the
whirlpool
of
arbitrary
and
irrational
criticism
whenever
criticism
of
any
art
becomes
specialised
and
professional
whenever
a
class
of
adjudicators
is
brought
into
existence
those
adjudicators
are
apt
to
become
as
a
class
distrustful
of
their
immediate
impressions
and
anxious
for
methods
of
comparison
between
work
and
work
they
begin
to
emulate
the
classifications
and
exact
measurements
of
a
science
and
to
set
up
ideals
and
rules
as
data
for
such
classification
and
measurements
they
develop
an
alleged
sense
of
technique
which
is
too
often
no
more
than
the
attempt
to
exact
a
laboriousness
of
method
or
to
insist
upon
peculiarities
of
method
which
impress
the
professional
critic
not
so
much
as
being
merits
as
being
meritorious
this
sort
of
thing
has
gone
very
far
with
the
critical
discussion
both
of
the
novel
and
the
play
you
have
all
heard
that
impressive
dictum
that
some
particular
theatrical
display
although
moving
interesting
and
continually
entertaining
from
start
to
finish
was
for
occult
technical
reasons
not
a
play
and
in
the
same
way
you
are
continually
having
your
appreciation
of
fiction
dashed
by
the
mysterious
parallel
condemnation
that
the
story
you
like
is
a
novel
the
novel
has
been
treated
as
though
its
form
was
as
as
the
sonnet
some
year
or
so
ago
for
example
there
was
a
quite
serious
discussion
which
began
i
believe
in
a
weekly
paper
devoted
to
the
interests
of
various
nonconformist
religious
organisations
about
the
proper
length
for
a
novel
the
critic
was
to
begin
his
painful
duties
with
a
yard
measure
the
matter
was
taken
up
with
profound
gravity
by
the
and
a
considerable
number
of
literary
men
and
women
were
circularised
and
asked
to
state
in
the
face
of
tom
jones
the
vicar
of
wakefield
the
story
and
bleak
house
just
exactly
how
long
the
novel
ought
to
be
our
replies
varied
according
to
the
civility
of
our
natures
but
the
mere
attempt
to
raise
the
question
shows
i
think
how
widespread
among
the
editorial
sort
of
people
is
this
notion
of
prescribing
a
definite
length
and
a
definite
form
for
the
novel
in
the
newspaper
correspondence
that
followed
our
friend
the
weary
giant
made
a
transitory
appearance
again
we
were
told
the
novel
ought
to
be
long
enough
for
him
to
take
up
after
dinner
and
finish
before
his
whisky
at
eleven
that
was
obviously
a
echo
of
edgar
allan
poe
discussion
of
the
short
story
edgar
allan
poe
was
very
definite
upon
the
point
that
the
short
story
should
be
finished
at
a
sitting
but
the
novel
and
short
story
are
two
entirely
different
things
and
the
train
of
reasoning
that
made
the
american
master
limit
the
short
story
to
about
an
hour
of
reading
as
a
maximum
does
not
apply
to
the
longer
work
a
short
story
is
or
should
be
a
simple
thing
it
aims
at
producing
one
single
vivid
effect
it
has
to
seize
the
attention
at
the
outset
and
never
relaxing
gather
it
together
more
and
more
until
the
climax
is
reached
the
limits
of
the
human
capacity
to
attend
closely
therefore
set
a
limit
to
it
it
must
explode
and
finish
before
interruption
occurs
or
fatigue
sets
in
but
the
novel
i
hold
to
be
a
discursive
thing
it
is
not
a
single
interest
but
a
woven
tapestry
of
interests
one
is
drawn
on
first
by
this
affection
and
curiosity
and
then
by
that
it
is
something
to
return
to
and
i
do
not
see
that
we
can
possibly
set
any
limit
to
its
extent
the
distinctive
value
of
the
novel
among
written
works
of
art
is
in
characterisation
and
the
charm
of
a
character
lies
not
in
knowing
its
destiny
but
in
watching
its
proceedings
for
my
own
part
i
will
confess
that
i
find
all
the
novels
of
dickens
long
as
they
are
too
short
for
me
i
am
sorry
they
do
not
flow
into
one
another
more
than
they
do
i
wish
micawber
and
dick
swiveller
and
sairey
gamp
turned
up
again
in
other
novels
than
their
own
just
as
shakespeare
ran
the
glorious
glow
of
falstaff
through
a
group
of
plays
but
dickens
tried
this
once
when
he
carried
on
the
pickwick
club
into
master

that
experiment
was
unsatisfactory
and
he
did
not
attempt
anything
of
the
sort
again
following
on
the
days
of
dickens
the
novel
began
to
contract
to
subordinate
characterisation
to
story
and
description
to
drama
considerations
of
a
sordid
nature
i
am
told
had
to
do
with
that
something
about
a
guinea
and
a
half
and
six
shillings
with
which
we
will
not
concern
ourselves
but
i
rejoice
to
see
many
signs
that
that
phase
of
narrowing
and
restriction
is
over
and
that
there
is
every
encouragement
for
a
return
towards
a
laxer
more
spacious
form
of
the
movement
is
partly
of
english
origin
a
revolt
against
those
more
exacting
and
cramping
conceptions
of
artistic
perfection
to
which
i
will
recur
in
a
moment
and
a
return
to
the
lax
freedom
of
form
the
rambling
discursiveness
the
right
to
roam
of
the
earlier
english
novel
of
tristram
shandy
and
of
tom
jones
and
partly
it
comes
from
abroad
and
derives
a
stimulus
from
such
bold
and
original
enterprises
as
that
of
monsieur
rolland
in
his
jean
christophe
its
double
origin
involves
a
double
nature
for
while
the
english
spirit
is
towards
discursiveness
and
variety
the
new
french
movement
is
rather
towards
exhaustiveness
arnold
bennett
has
experimented
in
both
forms
of
amplitude
his
superb
old
wives
tale
wandering
from
person
to
person
and
from
scene
to
scene
is
by
far
the
finest
long
novel
that
has
been
written
in
english
in
the
english
fashion
in
this
generation
and
now
in
clayhanger
and
its
promised
collaterals
he
undertakes
that
complete
minute
abundant
presentation
of
the
growth
and
modification
of
one
or
two
individual
minds
which
is
the
essential
characteristic
of
the
continental
movement
towards
the
novel
of
amplitude
while
the
old
wives
tale
is
discursive
clayhanger
is
exhaustive
he
gives
us
both
types
of
the
new
movement
in
perfection
i
name
jean
christophe
as
a
sort
of
archetype
in
this
connection
because
it
is
just
at
present
very
much
in
our
thoughts
by
reason
of
the
admirable
translation
cannan
is
giving
us
but
there
is
a
greater
predecessor
to
this
comprehensive
and
spectacular
treatment
of
a
single
mind
and
its
impressions
and
ideas
or
of
one
or
two
associated
minds
that
comes
to
us
now
bennett
and
cannan
from
france
the
great
original
of
all
this
work
is
that
colossal
last
unfinished
book
of
flaubert
bouvard
et
pécuchet
flaubert
the
bulk
of
whose
life
was
spent
upon
the
most
austere
and
restrained
fiction
turgenev
was
not
more
austere
and
restrained
broke
out
at
last
into
this
gay
sad
miracle
of
intellectual
abundance
it
is
not
extensively
read
in
this
country
it
is
not
yet
i
believe
translated
into
english
but
there
it
is
and
if
it
is
new
to
the
reader
i
make
him
this
present
of
the
secret
of
a
book
that
is
a
precious
wilderness
of
wonderful
reading
but
if
flaubert
is
really
the
continental
emancipator
of
the
novel
from
the
restrictions
of
form
the
master
to
whom
we
of
the
english
persuasion
we
of
the
discursive
school
must
for
ever
recur
is
he
whom
i
will
maintain
against
all
comers
to
be
the
subtlest
and
greatest
i
lay
stress
upon
that
word
artist
that
great
britain
has
ever
produced
in
all
that
is
essentially
the
novel
laurence
sterne
the
confusion
between
the
standards
of
a
short
story
and
the
standards
of
the
novel
which
leads
at
last
to
these
what
shall
i
call
them
gazettisms
about
the
correct
length
to
which
the
novelist
should
aspire
leads
also
to
all
kinds
of
absurd
condemnations
and
exactions
upon
matters
of
method
and
style
the
underlying
fallacy
is
always
this
the
assumption
that
the
novel
like
the
story
aims
at
a
single
concentrated
impression
from
that
comes
a
fertile
growth
of
error
constantly
one
finds
in
the
reviews
of
works
of
fiction
the
complaint
that
this
that
or
the
other
thing
in
a
novel
is
irrelevant
now
it
is
the
easiest
thing
and
most
fatal
thing
to
become
irrelevant
in
a
short
story
a
short
story
should
go
to
its
point
as
a
man
flies
from
a
pursuing
tiger
he
pauses
not
for
the
daisies
in
his
path
or
to
note
the
pretty
moss
on
the
tree
he
climbs
for
safety
but
the
novel
by
comparison
is
like
breakfasting
in
the
open
air
on
a
summer
morning
nothing
is
irrelevant
if
the
waiter
mood
is
happy
and
the
tapping
of
the
thrush
upon
the
garden
path
or
the
petal
of
that
floats
down
into
my
coffee
is
as
relevant
as
the
egg
i
open
or
the
bread
and
butter
i
bite
and
all
sorts
of
things
that
inevitably
mar
the
tense
illusion
which
is
the
aim
of
the
short
story
the
introduction
for
example
of
the
author
personality
any
comment
that
seems
to
admit
that
after
all
fiction
is
fiction
a
change
in
manner
between
part
and
part
burlesque
parody
invective
all
such
thing
are
not
necessarily
wrong
in
the
novel
of
course
all
these
things
may
fail
in
their
effect
they
may
jar
hinder
irritate
and
all
are
difficult
to
do
well
but
it
is
no
artistic
merit
to
evade
a
difficulty
any
more
than
it
is
a
merit
in
a
hunter
to
refuse
even
the
highest
of
fences
nearly
all
the
novels
that
have
by
the
lapse
of
time
reached
an
assured
position
of
recognised
greatness
are
not
only
saturated
in
the
personality
of
the
author
but
have
in
addition
quite
unaffected
personal
outbreaks
the
least
successful
instance
the
one
that
is
made
the
text
against
all
such
interventions
is
of
course
thackeray
but
i
think
the
trouble
with
thackeray
is
not
that
he
makes
interventions
but
that
he
does
so
with
a
curious
touch
of
dishonesty
i
agree
with
the
late
craigie
that
there
was
something
profoundly
vulgar
about
thackeray
it
was
a
sham
thoughtful
sham
pose
he
assumed
it
is
an
aggressive
conscious
challenging
person
astride
before
a
fire
and
a
little
distended
by
dinner
and
a
sense
of
social
and
literary
precedences
who
uses
the
first
person
in
thackeray
novels
it
is
the
real
thackeray
it
is
a
frank
man
who
looks
you
in
the
eyes
and
bares
his
soul
and
demands
your
sympathy
that
is
a
criticism
of
thackeray
but
it
is
a
condemnation
of
intervention
i
admit
that
for
a
novelist
to
come
in
person
in
this
way
before
his
readers
involves
grave
risks
but
when
it
is
done
without
affectations
starkly
as
a
man
comes
in
out
of
the
darkness
to
tell
of
perplexing
things
without
as
for
instance
joseph
conrad
does
for
all
practical
purposes
in
his
lord
jim
then
it
gives
a
sort
of
depth
a
sort
of
subjective
reality
that
no
such
cold
almost
affectedly
ironical
detachment
as
that
which
distinguishes
the
work
of
john
galsworthy
for
example
can
ever
attain
and
in
some
cases
the
whole
art
and
delight
of
a
novel
may
lie
in
the
author
personal
interventions
let
such
novels
as
elizabeth
and
her
german
garden
and
the
same
writer
elizabeth
in
rügen
bear
witness
now
all
this
time
i
have
been
hacking
away
at
certain
hampering
and
limiting
beliefs
about
the
novel
letting
it
loose
as
it
were
in
form
and
purpose
i
have
still
to
say
just
what
i
think
the
novel
is
and
where
if
anywhere
its
ought
to
be
drawn
it
is
by
no
means
an
easy
task
to
define
the
novel
it
is
not
a
thing
premeditated
it
is
a
thing
that
has
grown
up
into
modern
life
and
taken
upon
itself
uses
and
produced
results
that
could
not
have
been
foreseen
by
its
originators
few
of
the
important
things
in
the
collective
life
of
man
started
out
to
be
what
they
are
consider
for
example
all
the
unexpected
aesthetic
values
the
inspiration
and
variety
of
emotional
result
which
arises
out
of
the
plan
of
the
gothic
cathedral
and
the
undesigned
delight
and
wonder
of
white
marble
that
has
ensued
as
i
have
been
told
through
the
ageing
and
whitening
of
the
realistically
coloured
statuary
of
the
greeks
and
romans
much
of
the
charm
of
the
old
furniture
and
needlework
again
upon
which
the
present
time
sets
so
much
store
lies
in
acquired
and
unpremeditated
qualities
and
no
doubt
the
novel
grew
up
out
of
simple
and
the
universal
desire
of
children
old
and
young
alike
for
a
story
it
is
only
slowly
that
we
have
developed
the
distinction
of
the
novel
from
the
romance
as
being
a
story
of
human
beings
absolutely
credible
and
conceivable
as
distinguished
from
human
beings
frankly
endowed
with
the
glamour
the
wonder
the
brightness
of
a
less
exacting
and
more
vividly
eventful
world
the
novel
is
a
story
that
demands
or
professes
to
demand
no
the
novelist
undertakes
to
present
you
people
and
things
as
real
as
any
that
you
can
meet
in
an
omnibus
and
i
suppose
it
is
conceivable
that
a
novel
might
exist
which
was
just
purely
a
story
of
that
kind
and
nothing
more
it
might
amuse
you
as
one
is
amused
by
looking
out
of
a
window
into
a
street
or
listening
to
a
piece
of
agreeable
music
and
that
might
be
the
limit
of
its
effect
but
almost
always
the
novel
is
something
more
than
that
and
produces
more
effect
than
that
the
novel
has
inseparable
moral
consequences
it
leaves
impressions
not
simply
of
things
seen
but
of
acts
judged
and
made
attractive
or
unattractive
they
may
prove
very
slight
moral
consequences
and
very
shallow
moral
impressions
in
the
long
run
but
there
they
are
none
the
less
its
inevitable
accompaniments
it
is
unavoidable
that
this
should
be
so
even
if
the
novelist
attempts
or
affects
to
be
impartial
he
still
can
not
prevent
his
characters
setting
examples
he
still
can
not
avoid
as
people
say
putting
ideas
into
his
readers
heads
the
greater
his
skill
the
more
convincing
his
treatment
the
more
vivid
his
power
of
suggestion
and
it
is
equally
impossible
for
him
not
to
betray
his
sense
that
the
proceedings
of
this
person
are
rather
jolly
and
admirable
and
of
that
rather
ugly
and
detestable
i
suppose
bennett
for
example
would
say
that
he
should
not
do
so
but
it
is
as
manifest
to
any
disinterested
observer
that
he
greatly
loves
and
admires
his
card
as
that
richardson
admired
his
sir
charles
grandison
or
that
humphry
ward
considers
her
marcella
a
very
fine
and
estimable
young
woman
and
i
think
it
is
just
in
this
that
the
novel
is
not
simply
a
fictitious
record
of
conduct
but
also
a
study
and
judgment
of
conduct
and
through
that
of
the
ideas
that
lead
to
conduct
that
the
real
and
increasing
value
or
perhaps
to
avoid
controversy
i
had
better
say
the
real
and
increasing
importance
of
the
novel
and
of
the
novelist
in
modern
life
comes
in
it
is
no
new
discovery
that
the
novel
like
the
drama
is
a
powerful
instrument
of
moral
suggestion
this
has
been
understood
in
england
ever
since
there
has
been
such
a
thing
as
a
novel
in
england
this
has
been
recognised
equally
by
novelists
and
the
people
who
would
read
novels
under
any
condition
whatever
richardson
wrote
deliberately
for
edification
and
tom
jones
is
a
powerful
and
effective
appeal
for
a
charitable
and
even
indulgent
attitude
towards
men
but
excepting
fielding
and
one
or
two
other
of
those
partial
exceptions
that
always
occur
in
the
case
of
critical
generalisations
there
is
a
definable
difference
between
the
novel
of
the
past
and
what
i
may
call
the
modern
novel
it
is
a
difference
that
is
reflected
upon
the
novel
from
a
difference
in
the
general
way
of
thinking
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
formerly
there
was
a
feeling
of
certitude
about
moral
values
and
standards
of
conduct
that
is
altogether
absent
it
was
so
much
that
men
were
agreed
upon
these
things
about
these
things
there
have
always
been
enormous
divergences
of
opinion
as
that
men
were
emphatic
cocksure
and
unteachable
about
whatever
they
did
happen
to
believe
to
a
degree
that
no
longer
obtains
this
is
the
balfourian
age
and
even
religion
seeks
to
establish
itself
on
doubt
there
were
perhaps
just
as
many
differences
in
the
past
as
there
are
now
but
the
outlines
were
harder
they
were
indeed
so
hard
as
to
be
almost
to
our
sense
savage
you
might
be
a
roman
catholic
and
in
that
case
you
did
not
want
to
hear
about
protestants
turks
infidels
except
in
tones
of
horror
and
hatred
you
knew
exactly
what
was
good
and
what
was
evil
your
priest
informed
you
upon
these
points
and
all
you
needed
in
any
novel
you
read
was
a
confirmation
implicit
or
explicit
of
these
vivid
rather
than
charming
prejudices
if
you
were
a
protestant
you
were
equally
clear
and
unshakable
your
sect
whichever
sect
you
belonged
to
knew
the
whole
of
truth
and
included
all
the
nice
people
it
had
nothing
to
learn
in
the
world
and
it
wanted
to
learn
nothing
outside
its
sectarian
convictions
the
unbelievers
you
know
were
just
as
bad
and
said
their
creeds
with
an
equal
fury
merely
interpolating
people
of
every
sort
catholic
protestant
infidel
or
what
not
were
equally
clear
that
good
was
good
and
bad
was
bad
that
the
world
was
made
up
of
good
characters
whom
you
had
to
love
help
and
admire
and
of
bad
characters
to
whom
one
might
in
the
interests
of
goodness
even
lie
and
whom
one
had
to
foil
defeat
and
triumph
over
shamelessly
at
every
opportunity
that
was
the
quality
of
the
times
the
novel
reflected
this
quality
of
assurance
and
its
utmost
charity
was
to
unmask
an
apparent
villain
and
show
that
he
or
she
was
really
profoundly
and
correctly
good
or
to
unmask
an
apparent
saint
and
show
the
hypocrite
there
was
no
such
penetrating
and
pervading
element
of
doubt
and
curiosity
and
charity
about
the
rightfulness
and
beauty
of
conduct
such
as
one
meets
on
every
hand
the
of
the
past
therefore
like
the
of
the
more
provincial
parts
of
england
judged
a
novel
by
the
convictions
that
had
been
built
up
in
him
by
his
training
and
his
priest
or
his
pastor
if
it
agreed
with
these
convictions
he
approved
if
it
did
not
agree
he
disapproved
often
with
great
energy
the
novel
where
it
was
not
unconditionally
banned
altogether
as
a
thing
disturbing
and
unnecessary
was
regarded
as
a
thing
subordinated
to
the
teaching
of
the
priest
or
pastor
or
whatever
director
and
dogma
was
followed
its
modest
moral
confirmations
began
when
authority
had
completed
its
direction
the
novel
was
good
if
it
seemed
to
harmonise
with
the
graver
exercises
conducted
by
chadband
and
it
was
bad
and
outcast
if
chadband
said
so
and
it
is
over
the
bodies
of
discredited
and
disgruntled
chadbands
that
the
novel
escapes
from
its
servitude
and
inferiority
now
the
conflict
of
authority
against
criticism
is
one
of
the
eternal
conflicts
of
humanity
it
is
the
conflict
of
organisation
against
initiative
of
discipline
against
freedom
it
was
the
conflict
of
the
priest
against
the
prophet
in
ancient
judaea
of
the
pharisee
against
the
nazarene
of
the
realist
against
the
nominalist
of
the
church
against
the
franciscan
and
the
lollard
of
the
respectable
person
against
the
artist
of
the
of
mankind
against
the
shooting
buds
and
while
we
live
in
a
period
of
tightening
and
extending
social
organisation
we
live
also
in
a
period
of
adventurous
and
insurgent
thought
in
an
intellectual
spring
unprecedented
in
the
world
history
there
is
an
enormous
criticism
going
on
of
the
faiths
upon
which
men
lives
and
associations
are
based
and
of
every
standard
and
rule
of
conduct
and
it
is
inevitable
that
the
novel
just
in
the
measure
of
its
sincerity
and
ability
should
reflect
and
in
the
atmosphere
and
uncertainties
and
changing
variety
of
this
seething
and
creative
time
and
i
do
not
mean
merely
that
the
novel
is
unavoidably
charged
with
the
representation
of
this
wide
and
wonderful
conflict
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
conflict
the
essential
characteristic
of
this
great
intellectual
revolution
amidst
which
we
are
living
that
revolution
of
which
the
revival
and
restatement
of
nominalism
under
the
name
of
pragmatism
is
the
philosophical
aspect
consists
in
the
reassertion
of
the
importance
of
the
individual
instance
as
against
the
generalisation
all
our
social
political
moral
problems
are
being
approached
in
a
new
spirit
in
an
inquiring
and
experimental
spirit
which
has
small
respect
for
abstract
principles
and
deductive
rules
we
perceive
more
and
more
clearly
for
example
that
the
study
of
social
organisation
is
an
empty
and
unprofitable
study
until
we
approach
it
as
a
study
of
the
association
and
of
individualised
human
beings
inspired
by
diversified
motives
ruled
by
traditions
and
swayed
by
the
suggestions
of
a
complex
intellectual
atmosphere
and
all
our
conceptions
of
the
relationships
between
man
and
man
and
of
justice
and
rightfulness
and
social
desirableness
remain
something
misfitting
and
inappropriate
something
uncomfortable
and
potentially
injurious
as
if
we
were
trying
to
wear
clothes
made
for
a
giant
out
of
tin
until
we
bring
them
to
the
test
and
measure
of
realised
individualities
and
this
is
where
the
value
and
opportunity
of
the
modern
novel
comes
in
so
far
as
i
can
see
it
is
the
only
medium
through
which
we
can
discuss
the
great
majority
of
the
problems
which
are
being
raised
in
such
bristling
multitude
by
our
contemporary
social
development
nearly
every
one
of
those
problems
has
at
its
core
a
psychological
problem
and
not
merely
a
psychological
problem
but
one
in
which
the
idea
of
individuality
is
an
essential
factor
dealing
with
most
of
these
questions
by
a
rule
or
a
generalisation
is
like
putting
a
cordon
round
a
jungle
full
of
the
most
diversified
sort
of
game
the
hunting
only
begins
when
you
leave
the
cordon
behind
you
and
push
into
the
thickets
take
for
example
the
immense
cluster
of
difficulties
that
arises
out
of
the
increasing
complexity
of
our
state
on
every
hand
we
are
creating
officials
and
compared
with
only
a
few
years
ago
the
private
life
in
a
dozen
fresh
directions
comes
into
contact
with
officialdom
but
we
still
do
practically
nothing
to
work
out
the
interesting
changes
that
occur
in
this
sort
of
man
and
that
when
you
withdraw
him
as
it
were
from
the
common
crowd
of
humanity
put
his
mind
if
not
his
body
into
uniform
and
endow
him
with
powers
and
functions
and
rules
it
is
manifestly
a
study
of
the
profoundest
public
and
personal
importance
it
is
manifestly
a
study
of
increasing
importance
the
process
of
social
and
political
organisation
that
has
been
going
on
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
is
pretty
clearly
going
on
now
if
anything
with
increasing
vigour
and
for
the
most
part
the
entire
dependence
of
the
consequences
of
the
whole
problem
upon
the
reaction
between
the
office
on
the
one
hand
and
the
weak
uncertain
various
human
beings
who
take
office
on
the
other
does
seem
even
to
be
suspected
by
the
energetic
virtuous
and
more
or
less
amiable
people
whose
activities
in
politics
and
upon
the
backstairs
of
politics
bring
about
these
developments
they
assume
that
the
sort
of
official
they
need
a
combination
of
virtue
and
intelligence
with
unfailing
mechanical
obedience
can
be
made
out
of
just
any
young
nephew
and
i
know
of
no
means
of
persuading
people
that
this
is
a
rather
unjustifiable
assumption
and
of
creating
an
intelligent
controlling
criticism
of
officials
and
of
assisting
conscientious
officials
to
an
effective
and
generally
of
keeping
the
atmosphere
of
official
life
sweet
and
healthy
except
the
novel
yet
so
far
the
novel
has
scarcely
begun
its
attack
upon
this
particular
field
of
human
life
and
all
the
attractive
varied
play
of
motive
it
contains
of
course
we
have
one
supreme
and
devastating
study
of
the
illiterate
minor
official
in
bumble
that
one
figure
lit
up
and
still
lights
the
whole
problem
of
poor
law
administration
for
the
english
reading
community
it
was
a
translation
of
regulations
and
conceptions
of
social
order
into
blundering
arrogant
flesh
and
blood
it
was
worth
a
hundred
royal
commissions
you
may
make
your
regulations
as
you
please
said
dickens
in
effect
this
is
one
sample
of
the
stuff
that
will
carry
them
out
but
bumble
stands
almost
alone
instead
of
realising
that
he
is
only
one
aspect
of
officialdom
we
are
all
too
apt
to
make
him
the
type
of
all
officials
and
not
an
urban
district
council
can
get
into
a
dispute
about
its
electric
light
without
being
denounced
as
a
bumbledom
by
some
whirling
enemy
or
other
the
burthen
upon
bumble
shoulders
is
too
heavy
to
be
borne
and
we
want
the
contemporary
novel
to
give
us
a
score
of
other
figures
to
put
beside
him
other
aspects
and
reflections
upon
this
great
problem
of
officialism
made
flesh
bumble
is
a
magnificent
figure
of
the
follies
and
cruelties
of
ignorance
in
office
i
would
have
every
candidate
for
the
post
of
workhouse
master
pass
a
severe
examination
upon
oliver
twist
but
it
is
not
only
caricature
and
satire
i
demand
we
must
have
not
only
the
fullest
treatment
of
the
temptations
vanities
abuses
and
absurdities
of
office
but
all
its
dreams
its
sense
of
constructive
order
its
consolations
its
sense
of
service
and
its
nobler
satisfactions
you
may
say
that
is
demanding
more
insight
and
power
in
our
novels
and
novelists
than
we
can
possibly
hope
to
find
in
them
so
much
the
worse
for
us
i
stick
to
my
thesis
that
the
complicated
social
organisation
of
can
not
get
along
without
the
amount
of
mutual
understanding
and
mutual
explanation
such
a
range
of
characterisation
in
our
novels
implies
the
success
of
civilisation
amounts
ultimately
to
a
success
of
sympathy
and
understanding
if
people
can
not
be
brought
to
an
interest
in
one
another
greater
than
they
feel
to
curiosities
and
criticisms
far
keener
and
far
subtler
than
we
have
now
if
class
can
not
be
brought
to
measure
itself
against
and
interchange
experience
and
sympathy
with
class
and
temperament
with
temperament
then
we
shall
never
struggle
very
far
beyond
the
confused
discomforts
and
uneasiness
of
and
the
changes
and
complications
of
human
life
will
remain
as
they
are
now
very
like
the
crumplings
and
separations
and
complications
of
an
immense
avalanche
that
is
sliding
down
a
hill
and
in
this
tremendous
work
of
human
reconciliation
and
elucidation
it
seems
to
me
it
is
the
novel
that
must
attempt
most
and
achieve
most
you
may
feel
disposed
to
say
to
all
this
we
grant
the
major
premises
but
why
look
to
the
work
of
prose
fiction
as
the
main
instrument
in
this
necessary
process
of
so
to
speak
sympathising
humanity
together
can
not
this
be
done
far
more
effectively
through
biography
and
autobiography
for
example
is
there
the
lyric
and
above
all
there
the
play
well
so
far
as
the
stage
goes
i
think
it
is
a
very
charming
and
exciting
form
of
human
activity
a
display
of
actions
and
surprises
of
the
most
moving
and
impressive
sort
but
beyond
the
opportunity
it
affords
for
saying
startling
and
things
opportunities
shaw
for
example
has
worked
to
the
utmost
limit
i
do
not
see
that
the
drama
does
much
to
enlarge
our
sympathies
and
add
to
our
stock
of
motive
ideas
and
regarded
as
a
medium
for
startling
and
things
the
stage
seems
to
me
an
extremely
clumsy
and
costly
affair
one
might
just
as
well
go
about
with
a
pencil
writing
up
the
phrase
whatever
it
is
on
walls
the
drama
excites
our
sympathies
intensely
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
far
too
objective
a
medium
to
widen
them
appreciably
and
it
is
that
widening
that
increase
in
the
range
of
understanding
at
which
i
think
civilisation
is
aiming
the
case
for
biography
and
more
particularly
autobiography
as
against
the
novel
is
i
admit
at
the
first
blush
stronger
you
may
say
why
give
us
these
creatures
of
a
imagination
these
phantom
and
fantastic
thinkings
and
doings
when
we
may
have
the
stories
of
real
lives
really
lived
the
intimate
record
of
actual
men
and
women
to
which
one
answers
ah
if
one
could
but
it
is
just
because
biography
does
deal
with
actual
lives
actual
facts
because
it
radiates
out
to
touch
continuing
interests
and
sensitive
survivors
that
it
is
so
unsatisfactory
so
untruthful
its
inseparable
falsehood
is
the
worst
of
all
kinds
of
falsehood
the
falsehood
of
omission
think
what
an
abounding
astonishing
perplexing
person
gladstone
must
have
been
in
life
and
consider
lord
morley
life
of
gladstone
cold
dignified
not
a
life
at
all
indeed
so
much
as
embalmed
remains
the
fire
gone
the
passions
gone
the
bowels
carefully
removed
all
biography
has
something
of
that
coldness
and
respect
and
as
for
autobiography
a
man
may
show
his
soul
in
a
thousand
ways
but
to
turn
upon
oneself
and
explain
oneself
is
given
to
no
one
it
is
the
natural
liars
and
braggarts
your
cellinis
and
casanovas
men
with
a
habit
of
regarding
themselves
with
a
kind
of
objective
admiration
who
do
best
in
autobiography
and
on
the
other
hand
the
novel
has
neither
the
intense
of
autobiography
nor
the
paralysing
responsibilities
of
the
biographer
it
is
by
comparison
irresponsible
and
free
because
its
characters
are
figments
and
phantoms
they
can
be
made
entirely
transparent
because
they
are
fictions
and
you
know
they
are
fictions
so
that
they
can
not
hold
you
for
an
instant
so
soon
as
they
cease
to
be
true
they
have
a
power
of
veracity
quite
beyond
that
of
actual
records
every
novel
carries
its
own
justification
and
its
own
condemnation
in
its
success
or
failure
to
convince
you
that
thing
was
now
history
biography
and
so
forth
can
hardly
ever
get
beyond
the
statement
that
the
superficial
fact
was
so
you
see
now
the
scope
of
the
claim
i
am
making
for
the
novel
it
is
to
be
the
social
mediator
the
vehicle
of
understanding
the
instrument
of
the
parade
of
morals
and
the
exchange
of
manners
the
factory
of
customs
the
criticism
of
laws
and
institutions
and
of
social
dogmas
and
ideas
it
is
to
be
the
home
confessional
the
initiator
of
knowledge
the
seed
of
fruitful
let
me
be
very
clear
here
i
do
not
mean
for
a
moment
that
the
novelist
is
going
to
set
up
as
a
teacher
as
a
sort
of
priest
with
a
pen
who
will
make
men
and
women
believe
and
do
this
and
that
the
novel
is
not
a
new
sort
of
pulpit
humanity
is
passing
out
of
the
phase
when
men
preachers
and
dogmatic
influences
but
the
novelist
is
going
to
be
the
most
potent
of
artists
because
he
is
going
to
present
conduct
devise
beautiful
conduct
discuss
conduct
analyse
conduct
suggest
conduct
illuminate
it
through
and
through
he
will
not
teach
but
discuss
point
out
plead
and
display
and
this
being
my
view
you
will
be
prepared
for
the
demand
i
am
now
about
to
make
for
an
absolutely
free
hand
for
the
novelist
in
his
choice
of
topic
and
incident
and
in
his
method
of
treatment
or
rather
if
i
may
presume
to
speak
for
other
novelists
i
would
say
it
is
not
so
much
a
demand
we
make
as
an
intention
we
proclaim
we
are
going
to
write
subject
only
to
our
limitations
about
the
whole
of
human
life
we
are
going
to
deal
with
political
questions
and
religious
questions
and
social
questions
we
can
not
present
people
unless
we
have
this
free
hand
this
unrestricted
field
what
is
the
good
of
telling
stories
about
people
lives
if
one
may
not
deal
freely
with
the
religious
beliefs
and
organisations
that
have
controlled
or
failed
to
control
them
what
is
the
good
of
pretending
to
write
about
love
and
the
loyalties
and
treacheries
and
quarrels
of
men
and
women
if
one
must
not
glance
at
those
varieties
of
physical
temperament
and
organic
quality
those
deeply
passionate
needs
and
distresses
from
which
half
the
storms
of
human
life
are
brewed
we
mean
to
deal
with
all
these
things
and
it
will
need
very
much
more
than
the
disapproval
of
provincial
librarians
the
hostility
of
a
few
influential
people
in
london
the
scurrility
of
one
paper
and
the
deep
and
obstinate
silences
of
another
to
stop
the
incoming
tide
of
aggressive
we
are
going
to
write
about
it
all
we
are
going
to
write
about
business
and
finance
and
politics
and
precedence
and
pretentiousness
and
decorum
and
indecorum
until
a
thousand
pretences
and
ten
thousand
impostures
shrivel
in
the
cold
clear
air
of
our
elucidations
we
are
going
to
write
of
wasted
opportunities
and
latent
beauties
until
a
thousand
new
ways
of
living
open
to
men
and
women
we
are
going
to
appeal
to
the
young
and
the
hopeful
and
the
curious
against
the
established
the
dignified
and
defensive
before
we
have
done
we
will
have
all
life
within
the
scope
of
the
novel
the
philosopher
public
library
suppose
a
philosopher
had
a
great
deal
of
money
to
spend
though
this
is
not
in
accordance
with
experience
it
is
not
inherently
impossible
and
suppose
he
thought
as
any
philosopher
does
think
that
the
british
public
ought
to
read
much
more
and
better
books
than
they
do
and
that
founding
public
libraries
was
the
way
to
induce
them
to
do
so
what
sort
of
public
libraries
would
he
found
that
i
submit
is
a
suitable
topic
for
a
disinterested
speculator
he
would
i
suppose
being
a
philosopher
begin
by
asking
himself
what
a
library
essentially
was
and
he
would
probably
come
to
the
eccentric
conclusion
that
it
was
essentially
a
collection
of
books
he
would
in
his
unworldliness
entirely
overlook
the
fact
that
it
might
be
a
job
for
a
municipally
influential
builder
a
costly
but
conspicuous
monument
to
opulent
generosity
a
an
employment
bureau
or
a
for
the
glowing
young
he
would
never
think
for
a
moment
of
a
library
as
a
thing
one
might
build
it
would
present
itself
to
him
with
astonishing
simplicity
as
a
thing
one
would
collect
bricks
ceased
to
be
literature
after
babylon
his
first
proceeding
would
be
i
suppose
to
make
a
list
of
that
collection
what
books
he
would
say
have
all
my
libraries
to
possess
anyhow
and
he
would
begin
to
jot
down
with
the
assistance
of
a
few
friends
perhaps
this
essential
list
he
would
being
a
philosopher
insist
on
good
editions
and
he
would
also
take
great
pains
with
the
selection
it
would
not
be
a
limited
or
an
exclusive
list
when
in
doubt
he
would
include
he
would
disregard
modern
fiction
very
largely
because
any
book
that
has
any
success
can
always
be
bought
for
sixpence
and
modern
poetry
because
with
an
exception
or
so
it
does
not
signify
at
all
he
would
set
almost
all
the
greek
and
roman
literature
in
translations
and
with
luminous
introductions
and
if
there
were
no
good
translations
he
would
give
some
good
man
or
so
to
make
one
translations
of
all
that
is
good
in
modern
european
literatures
and
last
but
largest
portion
of
his
list
editions
of
all
that
is
worthy
of
our
own
he
would
make
a
very
careful
list
of
thoroughly
modern
encyclopaedias
atlases
and
volumes
of
information
and
a
particularly
complete
catalogue
of
all
literature
that
is
still
copyright
and
then
with
perhaps
a
secretary
or
so
he
would
revise
all
his
lists
and
mark
against
every
book
whether
he
would
have
two
five
or
ten
or
twenty
copies
or
whatever
number
of
copies
of
it
he
thought
proper
in
each
library
then
next
being
a
philosopher
he
would
decide
that
if
he
was
going
to
buy
a
great
number
of
libraries
in
this
way
he
was
going
to
make
an
absolutely
new
sort
of
demand
for
these
books
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
special
sort
of
supply
he
would
not
expect
the
machinery
of
retail
to
meet
the
needs
of
wholesale
buying
so
he
would
go
either
to
wholesale
booksellers
or
directly
to
the
various
publishers
of
the
books
and
editions
he
had
chosen
and
ask
for
reasonable
special
prices
for
the
two
thousand
or
seven
thousand
or
fifty
thousand
of
each
book
he
required
and
the
publishers
would
of
course
give
him
very
special
prices
more
especially
in
the
case
of
the
books
he
would
probably
find
it
best
to
buy
whole
editions
in
sheets
and
bind
them
himself
in
strong
bindings
and
he
would
emerge
from
these
negotiations
in
possession
of
a
number
of
complete
libraries
each
of
how
many
books
less
than
twenty
thousand
ought
to
do
it
i
think
though
that
is
a
matter
for
separate
discussion
and
that
should
cost
him
buying
in
this
wholesale
way
under
rather
than
over
a
library
and
next
he
would
bethink
himself
of
the
readers
of
these
books
these
people
he
would
say
do
not
know
very
much
about
books
which
indeed
is
why
i
am
giving
them
this
library
accordingly
he
would
get
a
number
of
able
and
learned
people
to
write
him
guides
to
his
twenty
thousand
books
and
in
fact
to
the
whole
world
of
reading
a
guide
for
example
to
the
books
on
history
in
general
a
special
guide
to
books
on
english
history
or
french
or
german
history
a
guide
to
the
books
on
geology
a
guide
to
poetry
and
poetical
criticisms
and
so
forth
some
such
books
our
philosopher
would
find
already
done
the
bibliography
of
american
history
of
the
american
association
for
example
and
nield
guide
to
historical
fiction
and
what
are
not
done
he
would
commission
good
men
to
do
for
him
suppose
he
had
to
commission
forty
such
guides
altogether
and
that
they
cost
him
on
the
average
each
for
he
would
take
care
not
to
sweat
their
makers
then
that
would
add
another
to
his
expenditure
but
if
he
was
going
to
found
libraries
let
us
say
that
would
only
be
a
library
a
very
trivial
addition
to
his
expenditure
the
rarer
books
mentioned
in
these
various
guides
would
remind
him
however
of
the
many
even
his
ample
limit
of
twenty
thousand
forced
him
to
exclude
and
he
would
perhaps
consider
the
need
of
having
two
or
three
libraries
each
for
the
storage
of
a
hundred
thousand
books
or
so
not
kept
at
the
local
libraries
but
which
could
be
sent
to
them
at
a
day
notice
at
the
request
of
any
reader
and
then
and
only
then
would
he
give
his
attention
to
the
housing
and
staffing
that
this
reality
of
books
would
demand
being
a
philosopher
and
no
fool
he
would
draw
a
very
clear
hard
distinction
between
the
reckless
endowment
of
the
building
trade
and
the
dissemination
of
books
he
would
distinguish
too
between
a
library
and
a
and
would
find
no
great
attraction
in
the
prospect
of
supplying
the
national
youth
with
free
but
thumby
copies
of
the
sixpenny
magazines
he
would
consider
that
all
that
was
needed
for
his
library
was
first
easily
accessible
fireproof
shelving
for
his
collection
with
ample
space
for
his
additions
an
efficient
distributing
office
a
and
so
forth
and
eight
or
nine
not
too
large
well
lit
well
carpeted
well
warmed
and
well
ventilated
rooms
radiating
from
that
office
in
which
the
guides
and
so
forth
could
be
consulted
and
where
those
who
had
no
convenient
quiet
room
at
home
could
read
he
would
find
that
by
avoiding
architectural
vulgarities
a
simple
well
proportioned
building
satisfying
all
these
requirements
and
containing
housing
for
the
librarian
assistant
custodian
and
staff
could
be
built
for
between
and
excluding
the
cost
of
site
and
his
sites
which
he
would
not
choose
for
their
conspicuousness
might
average
something
under
another
he
would
try
to
make
a
bargain
with
the
local
people
for
their
in
his
enterprise
though
he
would
as
a
philosopher
understand
that
where
a
public
library
is
least
wanted
it
is
generally
most
needed
but
in
most
cases
he
would
succeed
in
stipulating
for
a
certain
standard
of
maintenance
by
the
local
authority
since
moderately
prosperous
illiterate
men
undervalue
education
and
most
town
councillors
are
moderately
illiterate
men
he
would
do
his
best
to
keep
the
salary
and
appointment
of
the
librarian
out
of
such
hands
he
would
stipulate
for
a
salary
of
at
least
in
addition
to
housing
light
and
heat
and
he
would
probably
find
it
advisable
to
appoint
a
little
committee
of
visitors
who
would
have
the
power
to
examine
qualifications
endorse
the
appointment
and
recommend
the
dismissal
of
all
his
four
hundred
librarians
he
would
probably
try
to
make
the
assistantship
at
a
year
or
thereabout
a
sort
of
local
scholarship
to
be
won
by
competition
and
only
the
cleaner
and
caretaker
place
would
be
left
to
the
local
politician
and
of
course
our
philosopher
would
stipulate
that
apart
from
all
other
expenditure
a
sum
of
at
least
a
year
should
be
set
aside
for
buying
new
books
so
our
rich
philosopher
would
secure
at
the
minimum
cost
a
number
of
efficiently
equipped
libraries
throughout
the
country
eight
thousand
pounds
down
and
a
year
is
about
as
cheap
as
a
public
library
can
be
below
that
level
it
would
be
cheaper
to
have
no
public
library
above
that
level
a
public
library
that
is
not
efficient
is
either
dishonestly
or
incapably
organised
or
managed
or
it
is
serving
too
large
a
district
and
needs
duplication
or
it
is
trying
to
do
too
much
about
chesterton
and
belloc
it
has
been
one
of
the
less
possible
dreams
of
my
life
to
be
a
painted
pagan
god
and
live
upon
a
ceiling
i
crown
myself
becomingly
in
stars
or
tendrils
or
with
electric
coruscations
as
the
mood
takes
me
and
wear
an
easy
costume
free
from
complications
and
appropriate
to
the
climate
of
those
agreeable
spaces
the
company
about
me
on
the
clouds
varies
greatly
with
the
mood
of
the
vision
but
always
it
is
in
some
way
if
not
always
a
very
obvious
way
beautiful
one
frequent
presence
is
chesterton
a
joyous
whirl
of
brush
work
appropriately
garmented
and
crowned
when
he
is
there
i
remark
the
whole
ceiling
is
by
a
sort
of
radiation
convivial
we
drink
limitless
old
october
from
handsome
flagons
and
we
argue
mightily
about
pride
his
weak
point
and
the
nature
of
deity
a
hygienic
attentive
and
essentially
anaesthetic
eagle
checks
in
the
absence
of
exercise
any
undue
enlargement
of
our
promethean
livers
chesterton
often
but
never
by
any
chance
belloc
belloc
i
admire
beyond
measure
but
there
is
a
sort
of
partisan
viciousness
about
belloc
that
bars
him
from
my
celestial
dreams
he
never
figures
no
not
even
in
the
remotest
corner
on
my
ceiling
and
yet
the
divine
artist
by
some
strange
skill
that
my
ignorance
of
his
technique
saves
me
from
the
presumption
of
explaining
does
indicate
exactly
where
belloc
is
a
little
quiver
of
the
paint
a
faint
aura
about
the
spectacular
masses
of
chesterton
i
am
not
certain
but
no
intelligent
beholder
can
look
up
and
miss
the
remarkable
fact
that
belloc
exists
and
that
he
is
away
safely
away
away
in
his
heaven
which
is
of
course
the
park
lane
imperialist
hell
there
he
presides
but
in
this
life
i
do
not
meet
chesterton
exalted
upon
clouds
and
there
is
but
the
mockery
of
that
endless
leisure
for
abstract
discussion
afforded
by
my
painted
entertainments
i
live
in
an
urgent
and
incessant
world
which
is
at
its
best
a
wildly
beautiful
confusion
of
impressions
and
at
its
worst
a
dingy
uproar
it
crowds
upon
us
and
jostles
us
we
get
our
little
interludes
for
thinking
and
talking
between
much
rough
scuffling
and
laying
about
us
with
our
fists
and
i
can
not
afford
to
be
continually
bickering
with
chesterton
and
belloc
about
forms
of
expression
there
are
others
for
whom
i
want
to
save
my
knuckles
one
may
be
wasteful
in
peace
and
leisure
but
economies
are
the
soul
of
conflict
in
many
ways
we
three
are
closely
akin
we
diverge
not
by
necessity
but
accident
because
we
speak
in
different
dialects
and
have
divergent
metaphysics
all
that
i
can
i
shall
persuade
to
my
way
of
thinking
about
thought
and
to
the
use
of
words
in
my
loose
expressive
manner
but
belloc
and
chesterton
and
i
are
too
grown
and
set
to
change
our
languages
now
and
learn
new
ones
we
are
on
different
roads
and
so
we
must
needs
shout
to
one
another
across
intervening
abysses
these
two
say
socialism
is
a
thing
they
do
not
want
for
men
and
i
say
socialism
is
above
all
what
i
want
for
men
we
shall
go
on
saying
that
now
to
the
end
of
our
days
but
what
we
do
all
three
want
is
something
very
alike
our
different
roads
are
parallel
i
aim
at
a
growing
collective
life
a
perpetually
enhanced
inheritance
for
our
race
through
the
fullest
freest
development
of
the
individual
life
what
they
aim
at
ultimately
i
do
not
understand
but
it
is
manifest
that
its
immediate
form
is
the
fullest
and
freest
development
of
the
individual
life
we
all
three
hate
equally
and
sympathetically
the
spectacle
of
human
beings
blown
up
with
windy
wealth
and
irresponsible
power
as
cruelly
and
absurdly
as
boys
blow
up
frogs
we
all
three
detest
the
complex
causes
that
dwarf
and
cripple
lives
from
the
moment
of
birth
and
starve
and
debase
great
masses
of
mankind
we
want
as
universally
as
possible
the
jolly
life
men
and
women
and
acting
freely
and
joyously
gathering
life
as
children
gather
in
corn
we
all
three
want
people
to
have
property
of
a
real
and
personal
sort
to
have
the
son
as
chesterton
put
it
bringing
up
the
port
his
father
laid
down
and
pride
in
the
pears
one
has
grown
in
one
own
garden
and
i
agree
with
chesterton
that
giving
giving
oneself
out
of
love
and
fellowship
is
the
salt
of
life
but
there
i
diverge
from
him
less
in
spirit
i
think
than
in
the
manner
of
his
expression
there
is
a
base
because
impersonal
way
of
giving
standing
drink
which
he
praises
as
noble
is
just
the
thing
i
can
not
stand
the
ultimate
mockery
and
vulgarisation
of
that
fine
act
of
bringing
out
the
cherished
thing
saved
for
the
guest
it
is
a
mere
commercial
transaction
essentially
of
the
evil
of
our
time
think
of
it
two
temporarily
homeless
beings
agree
to
drink
together
and
they
turn
in
and
face
the
public
supply
of
drink
a
little
vitiated
by
private
commercial
necessities
in
the
it
is
horrible
that
life
should
be
so
wholesale
and
heartless
and
jones
with
a
sudden
effusion
of
manner
thrusts
twopence
or
ninepence
got
god
knows
how
into
the
economic
mysteries
and
personal
delicacy
of
brown
i
as
soon
a
man
slipped
sixpence
down
my
neck
if
jones
has
used
love
and
sympathy
to
detect
a
certain
real
thirst
and
need
in
brown
and
knowledge
and
power
in
its
assuaging
by
some
specially
appropriate
fluid
then
we
have
an
altogether
different
matter
but
the
common
business
of
standing
treat
and
giving
presents
and
entertainments
is
as
proud
and
unspiritual
as
as
foolish
and
inhuman
as
that
sorry
compendium
of
mercantile
vices
the
game
of
poker
and
i
am
amazed
to
find
chesterton
commend
it
but
that
is
a
criticism
by
the
way
chesterton
and
belloc
agree
with
the
socialist
that
the
present
world
does
not
give
at
all
what
they
want
they
agree
that
it
fails
to
do
so
through
a
wild
derangement
of
our
property
relations
they
are
in
agreement
with
the
common
contemporary
man
whose
creed
is
stated
i
think
not
unfairly
but
with
the
omission
of
certain
important
articles
by
chesterton
that
the
derangements
of
our
property
relations
are
to
be
remedied
by
concerted
action
and
in
part
by
altered
laws
the
land
and
all
sorts
of
great
common
interests
must
be
if
not
owned
then
at
least
controlled
managed
checked
redistributed
by
the
state
our
real
difference
is
only
about
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
owning
i
do
not
see
how
belloc
and
chesterton
can
stand
for
anything
but
a
strong
state
as
against
those
wild
monsters
of
property
the
strong
big
private
owners
the
state
must
be
complex
and
powerful
enough
to
prevent
them
state
or
plutocrat
there
is
really
no
other
practical
alternative
before
the
world
at
the
present
time
either
we
have
to
let
the
big
financial
adventurers
the
aggregating
capitalist
and
his
press
in
a
loose
informal
combination
rule
the
earth
either
we
have
got
to
stand
aside
from
preventive
legislation
and
leave
things
to
work
out
on
their
present
lines
or
we
have
to
construct
a
collective
organisation
sufficiently
strong
for
the
protection
of
the
liberties
of
the
common
man
so
far
we
go
in
common
if
belloc
and
chesterton
are
not
socialists
they
are
at
any
rate
not
if
they
say
they
want
an
organised
christian
state
which
involves
practically
of
the
socialist
desire
then
in
the
face
of
our
big
common
enemies
of
adventurous
capital
of
alien
imperialism
base
ambition
base
intelligence
and
common
prejudice
and
ignorance
i
do
not
mean
to
quarrel
with
them
politically
so
long
as
they
force
no
quarrel
on
me
their
organised
christian
state
is
nearer
the
organised
state
i
want
than
our
present
plutocracy
our
ideals
will
fight
some
day
and
it
will
be
i
know
a
fight
but
to
fight
now
is
to
let
the
enemy
in
when
we
have
got
all
we
want
in
common
then
and
only
then
can
we
afford
to
differ
i
have
never
believed
that
a
socialist
party
could
hope
to
form
a
government
in
this
country
in
my
lifetime
i
believe
it
less
now
than
ever
i
did
i
do
know
if
any
of
my
fabian
colleagues
entertain
so
remarkable
a
hope
but
if
they
do
not
then
unless
their
political
aim
is
pure
cantankerousness
they
must
contemplate
a
working
political
combination
between
the
socialist
members
in
parliament
and
just
that
section
of
the
liberal
party
for
which
chesterton
and
belloc
speak
perpetual
opposition
is
a
dishonourable
aim
in
politics
and
a
man
who
mingles
in
political
development
with
no
intention
of
taking
on
responsible
tasks
unless
he
gets
all
his
particular
formulae
accepted
is
a
pervert
a
victim
of
irish
bad
example
and
unfit
far
decent
democratic
institutions
i
digress
again
i
see
but
my
drift
i
hope
is
clear
differ
as
we
may
belloc
and
chesterton
are
with
all
socialists
in
being
on
the
same
side
of
the
great
political
and
social
cleavage
that
opens
at
the
present
time
we
and
they
are
with
the
interests
of
the
mass
of
common
men
as
against
that
growing
organisation
of
great
owners
who
have
common
interests
directly
antagonistic
to
those
of
the
community
and
state
we
socialists
are
only
secondarily
politicians
our
primary
business
is
not
to
impose
upon
but
to
ram
right
into
the
substance
of
that
object
of
chesterton
solicitude
the
circle
of
ideas
of
the
common
man
the
idea
of
the
state
as
his
own
as
a
thing
he
serves
and
is
served
by
we
want
to
add
to
his
sense
of
property
rather
than
offend
it
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
do
that
at
the
street
corners
and
on
the
trams
i
would
take
down
that
and
detestable
inscription
and
put
up
this
tram
this
street
belongs
to
the
people
of
london
would
chesterton
or
belloc
quarrel
with
that
suppose
that
chesterton
is
right
and
that
there
are
incurable
things
in
the
mind
of
the
common
man
flatly
hostile
to
our
ideals
so
much
of
our
ideals
will
fail
but
we
are
doing
our
best
by
our
lights
and
all
we
can
what
are
chesterton
and
belloc
doing
if
our
ideal
is
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
are
they
trying
to
build
up
a
better
ideal
will
they
state
a
utopia
and
how
they
propose
it
shall
be
managed
if
they
lend
their
weight
only
to
such
fine
old
propositions
as
that
a
man
wants
freedom
that
he
has
a
right
to
do
as
he
likes
with
his
own
and
so
on
they
wo
help
the
common
man
much
all
that
fine
talk
without
some
further
exposition
goes
to
sustain
rockefeller
simple
human
love
of
property
and
the
woman
and
child
sweating
manufacturer
in
his
fight
for
the
home
industry
i
bought
on
a
bookstall
the
other
day
a
pamphlet
full
of
misrepresentation
and
bad
argument
against
socialism
by
an
australian
jew
published
by
the
people
apparently
in
a
disinterested
attempt
to
free
the
land
from
the
landowner
by
the
simple
expedient
of
abusing
anyone
else
who
wanted
to
do
as
much
but
did
not
hold
henry
george
to
be
god
and
lord
and
i
know
socialists
who
will
protest
with
tears
in
their
eyes
against
association
with
any
human
being
who
sings
any
song
but
the
red
flag
and
doubts
whether
marx
had
much
experience
of
affairs
well
there
is
no
reason
why
chesterton
and
belloc
should
at
their
level
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
when
we
talk
on
a
ceiling
or
at
a
with
any
touch
of
the
celestial
in
its
composition
chesterton
and
i
belloc
and
i
are
antagonists
with
an
undying
feud
but
in
the
fight
against
human
selfishness
and
narrowness
and
for
a
finer
juster
law
we
are
brothers
at
the
remotest
chesterton
is
a
socialist
agreed
but
now
as
between
us
and
the
master
of
elibank
or
sir
hugh
bell
or
any
other
free
trade
liberal
capitalist
or
landlord
which
side
is
he
on
you
can
not
have
more
than
one
fight
going
on
in
the
political
arena
at
the
same
time
because
only
one
party
or
group
of
parties
can
win
and
going
back
for
a
moment
to
that
point
about
a
utopia
i
want
one
from
chesterton
purely
unhelpful
criticism
is
enough
from
a
man
of
his
size
it
is
justifiable
for
him
to
go
about
sitting
on
other
people
utopias
i
appeal
to
his
sense
of
fair
play
i
have
done
my
best
to
reconcile
the
conception
of
a
free
and
generous
style
of
personal
living
with
a
social
organisation
that
will
save
the
world
from
the
harsh
predominance
of
dull
persistent
energetic
unscrupulous
grabbers
tempered
only
by
the
vulgar
extravagance
of
their
wives
and
sons
it
is
an
adequate
reply
to
say
that
nobody
stood
treat
there
and
that
the
simple
generous
people
like
to
beat
their
own
wives
and
children
on
occasion
in
a
loving
and
intimate
manner
and
that
they
wo
endure
the
spirit
of
sidney
webb
about
sir
thomas
more
there
are
some
writers
who
are
chiefly
interesting
in
themselves
and
some
whom
chance
and
the
agreement
of
men
have
picked
out
as
symbols
and
convenient
indications
of
some
particular
group
or
temperament
of
opinions
to
the
latter
it
is
that
sir
thomas
more
belongs
an
age
and
a
type
of
mind
have
found
in
him
and
his
utopia
a
figurehead
and
a
token
and
pleasant
and
honourable
as
his
personality
and
household
present
themselves
to
the
modern
reader
it
is
doubtful
if
they
would
by
this
time
have
retained
any
peculiar
distinction
among
the
many
other
contemporaries
of
whom
we
have
chance
glimpses
in
letters
and
suchlike
documents
were
it
not
that
he
happened
to
be
the
first
man
of
affairs
in
england
to
imitate
the
republic
of
plato
by
that
chance
it
fell
to
him
to
give
the
world
a
noun
and
an
adjective
of
abuse
utopian
and
to
record
how
under
the
stimulus
of
plato
releasing
influence
the
opening
problems
of
our
modern
world
presented
themselves
to
the
english
mind
of
his
time
for
the
most
part
the
problems
that
exercised
him
are
the
problems
that
exercise
us
some
of
them
it
may
be
have
grown
up
and
intermarried
new
ones
have
joined
their
company
but
few
if
any
have
disappeared
and
it
is
alike
in
his
resemblances
to
and
differences
from
the
modern
speculative
mind
that
his
essential
interest
lies
the
portrait
presented
by
contemporary
mention
and
his
own
intentional
and
unintentional
admissions
is
of
an
and
man
a
hard
worker
very
markedly
prone
to
quips
and
whimsical
sayings
and
plays
upon
words
and
aware
of
a
double
reputation
as
a
man
of
erudition
and
a
wit
this
latter
quality
it
was
that
won
him
advancement
at
court
and
it
may
have
been
his
too
clearly
confessed
reluctance
to
play
the
part
of
an
informal
table
jester
to
his
king
that
laid
the
grounds
of
that
deepening
royal
resentment
that
ended
only
with
his
execution
but
he
was
also
valued
by
the
king
for
more
solid
merits
he
was
needed
by
the
king
and
it
was
more
than
a
table
scorned
or
a
clash
of
opinion
upon
the
validity
of
divorce
it
was
a
more
general
estrangement
and
avoidance
of
service
that
caused
that
fit
of
regal
petulance
by
which
he
died
it
would
seem
that
he
began
and
ended
his
career
in
the
orthodox
religion
and
a
general
acquiescence
in
the
ideas
and
customs
of
his
time
and
he
played
an
honourable
and
acceptable
part
in
that
time
but
his
permanent
interest
lies
not
in
his
general
conformity
but
in
his
incidental
scepticism
in
the
fact
that
underlying
the
observances
and
recognised
rules
and
limitations
that
give
the
texture
of
his
life
were
the
profoundest
doubts
and
that
stirred
and
disturbed
by
plato
he
saw
fit
to
write
them
down
one
may
question
if
such
scepticism
is
in
itself
unusual
whether
any
large
proportion
of
great
statesmen
great
ecclesiastics
and
administrators
have
escaped
phases
of
destructive
of
destructive
criticism
of
the
principles
upon
which
their
general
careers
were
framed
but
few
have
made
so
public
an
admission
as
sir
thomas
more
a
good
catholic
undoubtedly
he
was
and
yet
we
find
him
capable
of
conceiving
a
community
excelling
all
christendom
in
wisdom
and
virtue
in
practice
his
sense
of
conformity
and
orthodoxy
was
manifest
enough
but
in
his
utopia
he
ventures
to
contemplate
and
that
not
merely
wistfully
but
with
some
confidence
the
possibility
of
an
absolute
religious
toleration
the
utopia
is
none
the
less
interesting
because
it
is
one
of
the
most
inconsistent
of
books
never
were
the
forms
of
socialism
and
communism
animated
by
so
entirely
an
individualist
soul
the
hands
are
the
hands
of
plato
the
greek
but
the
voice
is
the
voice
of
a
humane
but
limited
and
very
practical
english
gentleman
who
takes
the
inferiority
of
his
inferiors
for
granted
dislikes
friars
and
tramps
and
loafers
and
all
undisciplined
and
unproductive
people
and
is
ruler
in
his
own
household
he
abounds
in
sound
practical
ideas
for
the
migration
of
harvesters
for
the
universality
of
gardens
and
the
artificial
incubation
of
eggs
and
he
sweeps
aside
all
plato
suggestion
of
the
citizen
woman
as
though
it
had
never
entered
his
mind
he
had
indeed
the
whig
temperament
and
it
manifested
itself
down
even
to
the
practice
of
reading
aloud
in
company
which
still
prevails
among
the
more
representative
survivors
of
the
whig
tradition
he
argues
ably
against
private
property
but
no
thought
of
any
such
radicalism
as
the
admission
of
those
poor
peons
of
his
with
head
and
glaring
uniform
against
escape
to
participation
in
ownership
appears
in
his
proposals
his
communism
is
all
for
the
convenience
of
his
syphogrants
and
tranibores
those
gentlemen
of
gravity
and
experience
lest
one
should
swell
up
above
the
others
so
too
is
the
essential
whiggery
of
the
limitation
of
the
revenues
it
is
the
very
spirit
of
eighteenth
century
constitutionalism
and
his
whiggery
bears
utilitarianism
instead
of
the
vanity
of
a
flower
among
his
cities
all
of
a
size
so
that
he
that
knoweth
one
knoweth
all
the
benthamite
would
have
revised
his
sceptical
theology
and
admitted
the
possibility
of
heaven
like
any
whig
more
exalted
reason
above
the
imagination
at
every
point
and
so
he
fails
to
understand
the
magic
prestige
of
gold
making
that
beautiful
metal
into
vessels
of
dishonour
to
urge
his
case
against
it
nor
had
he
any
perception
of
the
charm
of
extravagance
for
example
or
the
desirability
of
various
clothing
the
utopians
went
all
in
coarse
linen
and
undyed
wool
why
should
the
world
be
coloured
and
all
the
economy
of
labour
and
shortening
of
the
working
day
was
to
no
other
end
than
to
prolong
the
years
of
study
and
the
joys
of
reading
aloud
the
simple
satisfactions
of
the
good
boy
at
his
lessons
to
the
very
end
of
life
in
the
institution
of
that
weal
publique
this
end
is
only
and
chiefly
pretended
and
minded
that
what
time
may
possibly
be
spared
from
the
necessary
occupations
and
affairs
of
the
commonwealth
all
that
the
citizens
should
withdraw
from
the
bodily
service
to
the
free
liberty
of
the
mind
and
garnishing
of
the
same
for
herein
they
suppose
the
felicity
of
this
life
to
consist
indeed
it
is
no
paradox
to
say
that
utopia
which
has
by
a
conspiracy
of
accidents
become
a
proverb
for
undisciplined
fancifulness
in
social
and
political
matters
is
in
reality
a
very
unimaginative
work
in
that
next
to
the
accident
of
its
priority
lies
the
secret
of
its
continuing
interest
in
some
respects
it
is
like
one
of
those
precious
and
delightful
scrapbooks
people
disinter
in
old
country
houses
its
very
poverty
of
synthetic
power
leaves
its
ingredients
the
cuttings
from
and
imitations
of
plato
the
recipe
for
the
hatching
of
eggs
the
stern
resolutions
against
scoundrels
and
rough
fellows
all
the
sharper
and
brighter
there
will
always
be
found
people
to
read
in
it
over
and
above
the
countless
multitudes
who
will
continue
ignorantly
to
use
its
name
for
everything
most
alien
to
more
essential
quality
traffic
and
rebuilding
the
london
traffic
problem
is
just
one
of
those
questions
that
appeal
very
strongly
to
the
more
prevalent
and
less
charitable
types
of
english
mind
it
has
a
practical
and
constructive
air
it
deals
with
impressively
enormous
amounts
of
tangible
property
it
rests
with
a
comforting
effect
of
solidity
upon
assumptions
that
are
at
once
doubtful
and
desirable
it
seems
free
from
metaphysical
considerations
and
it
has
none
of
those
disconcerting
personal
applications
those
penetrations
towards
intimate
qualities
that
makes
eugenics
for
example
faintly
but
persistently
uncomfortable
it
is
indeed
an
ideal
problem
for
a
healthy
hopeful
and
progressive
public
man
and
as
i
say
it
deals
with
enormous
amounts
of
tangible
property
like
all
really
serious
and
respectable
british
problems
it
has
to
be
handled
gently
to
prevent
its
coming
to
pieces
in
the
gift
it
is
safest
in
charge
of
the
expert
that
wonderful
last
gift
of
time
he
will
talk
rapidly
about
congestion
wants
low
efficiency
economy
and
get
you
into
his
building
and
rebuilding
schemes
with
the
minimum
of
doubt
and
he
is
like
a
good
hendon
pilot
unspecialised
writers
have
the
destructive
analytical
touch
they
pull
the
wrong
levers
so
far
as
one
can
gather
from
the
specialists
on
the
question
there
is
very
considerable
congestion
in
many
of
the
london
thoroughfares
delays
that
seem
to
be
avoidable
occur
in
the
delivery
of
goods
multitudes
of
empty
vans
cumber
the
streets
we
have
hundreds
of
acres
of
idle
trucks
there
are
more
acres
of
railway
sidings
than
of
public
parks
in
greater
london
and
our
overseas
cousins
find
it
ticklish
work
crossing
regent
street
and
piccadilly
regarding
life
simply
as
an
affair
of
getting
people
and
things
from
where
they
are
to
where
they
appear
to
be
wanted
this
seems
all
very
muddled
and
wanton
so
far
it
is
quite
easy
to
agree
with
the
expert
and
some
of
the
various
and
entirely
incompatible
schemes
experts
are
giving
us
by
way
of
a
remedy
appeal
very
strongly
to
the
imagination
for
example
there
is
the
railway
clearing
house
which
it
is
suggested
should
cover
i
do
not
know
how
many
acres
of
what
is
now
slumland
in
shoreditch
the
position
is
particularly
convenient
for
an
underground
connection
with
every
main
line
into
london
upon
the
underground
level
of
this
great
building
every
goods
train
into
london
will
run
its
trucks
and
vans
will
be
unloaded
the
goods
passed
into
lifts
which
will
take
every
parcel
large
and
small
at
once
to
a
huge
ingeniously
contrived
above
there
in
a
manner
at
once
simple
ingenious
and
effective
they
will
be
sorted
and
returned
either
into
delivery
vans
at
the
street
level
or
to
the
trains
emptied
and
now
reloading
on
the
train
level
above
and
below
these
three
floors
will
be
extensive
warehouse
accommodation
such
a
scheme
would
not
only
release
almost
all
the
vast
area
of
london
now
under
railway
yards
for
parks
and
housing
but
it
would
give
nearly
every
delivery
van
an
effective
load
and
probably
reduce
the
number
of
standing
and
empty
vans
or
vans
on
the
streets
of
london
to
a
quarter
or
an
eighth
of
the
present
number
mostly
these
are
heavy
horse
vans
and
their
disappearance
would
greatly
facilitate
the
conversion
of
the
road
surfaces
to
the
hard
and
even
texture
needed
for
horseless
traffic
but
that
is
a
scheme
too
comprehensive
and
rational
for
the
ordinary
student
of
the
london
traffic
problem
whose
mind
runs
for
the
most
part
on
costly
and
devastating
rearrangements
of
the
existing
roadways
moreover
it
would
probably
secure
a
maximum
of
effect
with
a
minimum
of
property
manipulation
always
an
undesirable
consideration
in
practical
politics
and
it
would
commit
london
and
england
to
goods
transit
by
railway
for
another
century
far
more
attractive
to
the
expert
advisers
of
our
various
municipal
authorities
are
such
projects
as
a
new
thames
bridge
scheme
which
will
with
incalculable
results
inject
a
new
stream
of
traffic
into
saint
paul
churchyard
and
the
removal
of
charing
cross
station
to
the
south
side
of
the
river
then
again
we
have
the
systematic
widening
of
various
thoroughfares
the
shunting
of
tramways
into
traffic
streams
and
many
amusing
expensive
and
interesting
tunnellings
and
clearances
taken
together
these
huge
reconstructions
of
london
are
incoherent
and
conflicting
each
is
based
on
its
own
assumptions
and
separate
expert
advice
and
the
resulting
new
opening
plays
its
part
in
the
general
circulation
as
duct
or
aspirator
often
with
the
most
surprising
results
the
discussion
of
the
london
traffic
problem
as
we
practise
it
in
our
clubs
is
essentially
the
sage
turning
over
and
over
again
of
such
fragmentary
schemes
headshakings
over
the
vacant
sites
about
aldwych
and
the
strand
brilliant
petty
suggestions
and
dispersal
meanwhile
the
experts
intrigue
one
partial
plan
after
another
gets
itself
accepted
this
and
that
ancient
landmark
perish
builders
grow
rich
and
architects
infamous
and
some
tower
bridge
horror
some
vulgarity
of
the
automobile
club
type
some
buckingham
palace
atrocity
some
regent
street
stupidity
some
such
cramped
and
thwarted
thing
as
that
new
arch
which
gives
upon
charing
cross
is
added
to
the
confusion
i
do
not
see
any
reason
to
suppose
that
this
continuous
muddle
of
partial
destruction
and
partial
rebuilding
is
not
to
constitute
the
future
history
of
london
let
us
however
drop
the
expert
methods
and
handle
this
question
rather
more
rudely
do
we
want
london
rebuilt
if
we
do
is
there
after
all
any
reason
why
we
should
rebuild
it
on
its
present
site
london
is
where
it
is
for
reasons
that
have
long
ceased
to
be
valid
it
grew
there
it
has
accumulated
associations
an
immense
tradition
that
this
constant
mucking
about
of
builders
and
architects
is
destroying
almost
as
effectually
as
removal
to
a
new
site
the
old
sort
of
rebuilding
was
a
natural
and
picturesque
process
house
by
house
and
street
by
street
a
thing
as
pleasing
and
almost
as
natural
in
effect
as
the
spreading
and
interlacing
of
trees
as
this
new
building
this
clearance
of
areas
the
piercing
of
avenues
becomes
more
comprehensive
it
becomes
less
reasonable
if
we
can
do
such
big
things
we
may
surely
attempt
bigger
things
so
that
whether
we
want
to
plan
a
new
capital
or
preserve
the
old
it
comes
at
last
to
the
same
thing
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
be
constantly
pulling
down
the
london
we
have
and
putting
it
up
again
let
us
drain
away
our
heavy
traffic
into
tunnels
set
up
that
plan
and
control
the
growth
at
the
periphery
which
is
still
so
witless
and
ugly
and
save
for
the
manifest
tidying
and
preserving
that
is
needed
begin
to
leave
the
central
parts
of
london
which
are
extremely
interesting
even
where
they
are
not
quite
beautiful
in
peace
the
science
of
sociology
it
has
long
been
generally
recognised
that
there
are
two
quite
divergent
ways
of
attacking
sociological
and
economic
questions
one
that
is
called
scientific
and
one
that
is
not
and
i
claim
no
particular
virtue
in
the
recognition
of
that
but
i
do
claim
a
certain
freshness
in
my
analysis
of
this
difference
and
it
is
to
that
analysis
that
your
attention
is
now
called
when
i
claim
freshness
i
do
not
make
you
understand
any
claim
to
original
discovery
what
i
have
to
say
and
have
been
saying
for
some
time
is
also
more
or
less
and
with
certain
differences
to
be
found
in
the
thought
of
professor
bosanquet
for
example
in
alfred
sidgwick
use
of
words
in
reasoning
in
logic
in
contemporary
american
metaphysical
speculation
i
am
only
one
incidental
voice
speaking
in
a
general
movement
of
thought
my
trend
of
thought
leads
me
to
deny
that
sociology
is
a
science
or
only
a
science
in
the
same
loose
sense
that
modern
history
is
a
science
and
to
throw
doubt
upon
the
value
of
sociology
that
follows
too
closely
what
is
called
the
scientific
method
the
drift
of
my
argument
is
to
dispute
not
only
that
sociology
is
a
science
but
also
to
deny
that
herbert
spencer
and
comte
are
to
be
exalted
as
the
founders
of
a
new
and
fruitful
system
of
human
inquiry
i
find
myself
forced
to
depreciate
these
modern
idols
and
to
reinstate
the
greek
social
philosophers
in
their
vacant
niches
to
ask
you
rather
to
go
to
plato
for
the
proper
method
the
proper
way
of
thinking
sociologically
we
certainly
owe
the
word
sociology
to
comte
a
man
of
exceptionally
methodical
quality
i
hold
he
developed
the
word
logically
from
an
arbitrary
assumption
that
the
whole
universe
of
being
was
reducible
to
measurable
and
commeasurable
and
exact
and
consistent
expressions
in
a
very
obvious
way
sociology
seemed
to
comte
to
crown
the
edifice
of
the
sciences
it
was
to
be
to
the
statesman
what
pathology
and
physiology
were
to
the
doctor
and
one
gathers
that
for
the
most
part
he
regarded
it
as
an
intellectual
procedure
in
no
way
differing
from
physics
his
classification
of
the
sciences
shows
pretty
clearly
that
he
thought
of
them
all
as
exact
logical
systematisations
of
fact
arising
out
of
each
other
in
a
synthetic
order
each
lower
one
containing
the
elements
of
a
lucid
explanation
of
those
above
it
physics
explaining
chemistry
chemistry
physiology
physiology
sociology
and
so
forth
his
actual
method
was
altogether
unscientific
but
through
all
his
work
runs
the
assumption
that
in
contrast
with
his
predecessors
he
is
really
being
as
exact
and
universally
valid
as
mathematics
to
herbert
spencer
very
appropriately
since
his
mental
characteristics
make
him
the
english
parallel
to
comte
we
owe
the
naturalisation
of
the
word
in
english
his
mind
being
of
greater
calibre
than
comte
the
subject
acquired
in
his
hands
a
far
more
progressive
character
herbert
spencer
was
less
unfamiliar
with
natural
history
than
with
any
other
branch
of
practical
scientific
work
and
it
was
natural
he
should
turn
to
it
for
precedents
in
sociological
research
his
mind
was
invaded
by
the
idea
of
classification
by
memories
of
specimens
and
museums
and
he
initiated
that
accumulation
of
desiccated
anthropological
anecdotes
that
still
figures
importantly
in
current
sociological
work
on
the
lines
he
initiated
sociological
investigation
what
there
is
of
it
still
tends
to
go
from
these
two
sources
mainly
the
work
of
contemporary
sociologists
derives
but
there
persists
about
it
a
curious
discursiveness
that
reflects
upon
the
power
and
value
of
the
initial
impetus
branford
the
able
secretary
of
the
sociological
society
recently
attempted
a
useful
work
in
a
classification
of
the
methods
of
what
he
calls
approach
a
word
that
seems
to
me
eminently
judicious
and
expressive
a
review
of
the
first
volume
the
sociological
society
has
produced
brings
home
the
aptness
of
this
image
of
exploratory
operations
of
experiments
in
taking
a
line
the
names
of
beattie
crozier
and
benjamin
kidd
recall
works
that
impress
one
as
sketches
of
a
proposed
science
rather
than
concrete
beginnings
and
achievements
the
search
for
an
arrangement
a
method
continues
as
though
they
were
not
the
desperate
resort
to
the
analogical
method
of
commenius
is
confessed
by
steinmetz
who
talks
of
social
morphology
physiology
pathology
and
so
forth
there
is
also
a
less
initiative
disposition
in
the
vicomte
combes
de
lestrade
and
in
the
work
of
professor
giddings
in
other
directions
sociological
work
is
apt
to
lose
its
general
reference
altogether
to
lapse
towards
some
department
of
activity
not
primarily
sociological
at
all
examples
of
this
are
the
works
of
and
sidney
webb
ostrogorski
and
gustave
le
bon
from
a
contemplation
of
all
this
diversity
professor
durkheim
emerges
demanding
a
synthetic
science
certain
synthetic
conceptions
and
professor
karl
pearson
endorses
the
demand
to
fuse
all
these
various
activities
into
something
that
will
live
and
grow
what
is
it
that
tangles
this
question
so
curiously
that
there
is
not
only
a
failure
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
but
a
failure
to
join
issue
well
there
is
a
certain
not
too
clearly
recognised
order
in
the
sciences
to
which
i
wish
to
call
your
attention
and
which
forms
the
gist
of
my
case
against
this
scientific
pretension
there
is
a
gradation
in
the
importance
of
the
instance
as
one
passes
from
mechanics
and
physics
and
chemistry
through
the
biological
sciences
to
economics
and
sociology
a
gradation
whose
correlatives
and
implications
have
not
yet
received
adequate
recognition
and
which
do
profoundly
affect
the
method
of
study
and
research
in
each
science
let
me
begin
by
pointing
out
that
in
the
more
modern
conceptions
of
logic
it
is
recognised
that
there
are
no
identically
similar
objective
experiences
the
disposition
is
to
conceive
all
real
objective
being
as
individual
and
unique
this
is
not
a
singular
eccentric
idea
of
mine
it
is
one
for
which
ample
support
is
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
absolutely
respectable
contemporaries
who
are
quite
untainted
by
association
with
fiction
it
is
now
understood
that
conceivably
only
in
the
subjective
world
and
in
theory
and
the
imagination
do
we
deal
with
identically
similar
units
and
with
absolutely
commensurable
quantities
in
the
real
world
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
we
deal
at
most
with
similar
units
and
commensurable
quantities
but
there
is
a
strong
bias
a
sort
of
bias
in
the
normal
human
mind
to
ignore
this
and
not
only
to
speak
but
to
think
of
a
thousand
bricks
or
a
thousand
sheep
or
a
thousand
sociologists
as
though
they
were
all
absolutely
true
to
sample
if
it
is
brought
before
a
thinker
for
a
moment
that
in
any
special
case
this
is
not
so
he
slips
back
to
the
old
attitude
as
soon
as
his
attention
is
withdrawn
this
source
of
error
has
for
instance
caught
nearly
the
whole
race
of
chemists
with
one
or
two
distinguished
exceptions
and
and
and
so
forth
of
the
same
species
are
tacitly
assumed
to
be
similar
one
to
another
be
it
noted
that
so
far
as
the
practical
results
of
chemistry
and
physics
go
it
scarcely
matters
which
assumption
we
adopt
for
purposes
of
inquiry
and
discussion
the
incorrect
one
is
infinitely
more
convenient
but
this
ceases
to
be
true
directly
we
emerge
from
the
region
of
chemistry
and
physics
in
the
biological
sciences
of
the
eighteenth
century
commonsense
struggled
hard
to
ignore
individuality
in
shells
and
plants
and
animals
there
was
an
attempt
to
eliminate
the
more
conspicuous
departures
as
abnormalities
as
sports
nature
weak
moments
and
it
was
only
with
the
establishment
of
darwin
great
generalisation
that
the
hard
and
fast
classificatory
system
broke
down
and
individuality
came
to
its
own
yet
there
had
always
been
a
clearly
felt
difference
between
the
conclusions
of
the
biological
sciences
and
those
dealing
with
lifeless
substance
in
the
relative
vagueness
the
insubordinate
looseness
and
inaccuracy
of
the
former
the
naturalist
accumulated
facts
and
multiplied
names
but
he
did
not
go
triumphantly
from
generalisation
to
generalisation
after
the
fashion
of
the
chemist
or
physicist
it
is
easy
to
see
therefore
how
it
came
about
that
the
inorganic
sciences
were
regarded
as
the
true
scientific
it
was
scarcely
suspected
that
the
biological
sciences
might
perhaps
after
all
be
than
the
experimental
in
spite
of
the
difference
in
practical
value
in
favour
of
the
latter
it
was
and
is
by
the
great
majority
of
people
to
this
day
supposed
to
be
the
latter
that
are
invincibly
true
and
the
former
are
regarded
as
a
more
complex
set
of
problems
merely
with
obliquities
and
refractions
that
presently
will
be
explained
away
comte
and
herbert
spencer
certainly
seem
to
me
to
have
taken
that
much
for
granted
herbert
spencer
no
doubt
talked
of
the
unknown
and
the
unknowable
but
not
in
this
sense
as
an
element
of
inexactness
running
through
all
things
he
thought
of
the
unknown
as
the
indefinable
beyond
to
an
immediate
world
that
might
be
quite
clearly
and
exactly
known
well
there
is
a
growing
body
of
people
who
are
beginning
to
hold
the
converse
view
that
counting
classification
measurement
the
whole
fabric
of
mathematics
is
subjective
and
deceitful
and
that
the
uniqueness
of
individuals
is
the
objective
truth
as
the
number
of
units
taken
diminishes
the
amount
of
variety
and
inexactness
of
generalisation
increases
because
individuality
tells
more
and
more
could
you
take
men
by
the
thousand
billion
you
could
generalise
about
them
as
you
do
about
atoms
could
you
take
atoms
singly
it
may
be
you
would
find
them
as
individual
as
your
aunts
and
cousins
that
concisely
is
the
minority
belief
and
it
is
the
belief
on
which
this
present
paper
is
based
now
what
is
called
the
scientific
method
is
the
method
of
ignoring
individualities
and
like
many
mathematical
conventions
its
great
practical
convenience
is
no
proof
whatever
of
its
final
truth
let
me
admit
the
enormous
value
the
wonder
of
its
results
in
mechanics
in
all
the
physical
sciences
in
chemistry
even
in
physiology
but
what
is
its
value
beyond
that
is
the
scientific
method
of
value
in
biology
the
great
advances
made
by
darwin
and
his
school
in
biology
were
not
made
it
must
be
remembered
by
the
scientific
method
as
it
is
generally
conceived
at
all
he
conducted
a
research
into
history
he
collected
information
along
the
lines
indicated
by
certain
interrogations
and
the
bulk
of
his
work
was
the
digesting
and
critical
analysis
of
that
for
documents
and
monuments
he
had
fossils
and
anatomical
structures
and
germinating
eggs
too
innocent
to
lie
and
so
far
he
was
nearer
simplicity
but
on
the
other
hand
he
had
to
correspond
with
breeders
and
travellers
of
various
sorts
classes
entirely
analogous
from
the
point
of
view
of
evidence
to
the
writers
of
history
and
memoirs
i
question
profoundly
whether
the
word
science
in
current
usage
anyhow
ever
means
such
patient
disentanglement
as
darwin
pursued
it
means
the
attainment
of
something
positive
and
emphatic
in
the
way
of
a
conclusion
based
on
amply
repeated
experiments
capable
of
infinite
repetition
proved
as
they
say
up
to
the
hilt
it
would
be
of
course
possible
to
dispute
whether
the
word
science
should
convey
this
quality
of
certitude
but
to
most
people
it
certainly
does
at
the
present
time
so
far
as
the
movements
of
comets
and
electric
trams
go
there
is
no
doubt
practically
cocksure
science
and
indisputably
comte
and
herbert
spencer
believed
that
cocksure
could
be
extended
to
every
conceivable
finite
thing
the
fact
that
herbert
spencer
called
a
certain
doctrine
individualism
reflects
nothing
on
the
quality
of
his
primary
assumptions
and
of
his
mental
texture
he
believed
that
individuality
heterogeneity
was
and
is
an
evolutionary
product
from
an
original
homogeneity
it
seems
to
me
that
the
general
usage
is
entirely
for
the
limitation
of
the
use
of
the
word
science
to
knowledge
and
the
search
after
knowledge
of
a
high
degree
of
precision
and
not
simply
the
general
usage
science
is
measurement
science
is
organised
common
sense
proud
in
fact
of
its
essential
error
scornful
of
any
metaphysical
analysis
of
its
terms
if
we
quite
boldly
face
the
fact
that
hard
positive
methods
are
less
and
less
successful
just
in
proportion
as
our
ologies
deal
with
larger
and
less
numerous
individuals
if
we
admit
that
we
become
less
scientific
as
we
ascend
the
scale
of
the
sciences
and
that
we
do
and
must
change
our
method
then
it
is
humbly
submitted
we
shall
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
consider
the
question
of
approaching
sociology
we
shall
realise
that
all
this
talk
of
the
organisation
of
sociology
as
though
presently
the
sociologist
would
be
going
about
the
world
with
the
authority
of
a
sanitary
engineer
is
and
will
remain
nonsense
in
one
respect
we
shall
still
be
in
accordance
with
the
positivist
map
of
the
field
of
human
knowledge
with
us
as
with
that
sociology
stands
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
scale
from
the
molecular
sciences
in
these
latter
there
is
an
infinitude
of
units
in
sociology
as
comte
perceived
there
is
only
one
unit
it
is
true
that
herbert
spencer
in
order
to
get
classification
somehow
did
as
professor
durkheim
has
pointed
out
separate
human
society
into
societies
and
made
believe
they
competed
one
with
another
and
died
and
reproduced
just
like
animals
and
that
economists
following
list
have
for
the
purposes
of
fiscal
controversy
discovered
economic
types
but
this
is
a
transparent
device
and
one
is
surprised
to
find
thoughtful
and
reputable
writers
off
their
guard
against
such
bad
analogy
but
indeed
it
is
impossible
to
isolate
complete
communities
of
men
or
to
trace
any
but
rude
general
resemblances
between
group
and
group
these
alleged
units
have
as
much
individuality
as
pieces
of
cloud
they
come
they
go
they
fuse
and
separate
and
we
are
forced
to
conclude
that
not
only
is
the
method
of
observation
experiment
and
verification
left
far
away
down
the
scale
but
that
the
method
of
classification
under
types
which
has
served
so
useful
a
purpose
in
the
middle
group
of
subjects
the
subjects
involving
numerous
but
a
finite
number
of
units
has
also
to
be
abandoned
here
we
can
not
put
humanity
into
a
museum
or
dry
it
for
examination
our
one
single
still
living
specimen
is
all
history
all
anthropology
and
the
fluctuating
world
of
men
there
is
no
satisfactory
means
of
dividing
it
and
nothing
else
in
the
real
world
with
which
to
compare
it
we
have
only
the
remotest
ideas
of
its
and
a
few
relics
of
its
origin
and
dreams
of
its
destiny
sociology
it
is
evident
is
upon
any
hypothesis
no
less
than
the
attempt
to
bring
that
vast
complex
unique
being
its
subject
into
clear
true
relations
with
the
individual
intelligence
now
since
individual
intelligences
are
individual
and
each
is
a
little
differently
placed
in
regard
to
the
subject
under
consideration
since
the
personal
angle
of
vision
is
much
wider
towards
humanity
than
towards
the
circumambient
horizon
of
matter
it
should
be
manifest
that
no
sociology
of
universal
compulsion
of
anything
approaching
the
general
validity
of
the
physical
sciences
is
ever
to
be
hoped
for
at
least
upon
the
metaphysical
assumptions
of
this
paper
with
that
conceded
we
may
go
on
to
consider
the
more
hopeful
ways
in
which
that
great
being
may
be
presented
in
a
comprehensible
manner
essentially
this
presentation
must
involve
an
element
of
must
partake
quite
as
much
of
the
nature
of
art
as
of
science
one
finds
in
the
first
conference
of
the
sociological
society
professor
stein
speaking
indeed
a
very
different
philosophical
dialect
from
mine
but
coming
to
the
same
practical
conclusion
in
the
matter
and
osman
newland
counting
evolving
ideals
for
the
future
as
part
of
the
work
alfred
fouillée
also
moves
very
interestingly
in
the
region
of
this
same
idea
he
concedes
an
essential
difference
between
sociology
and
all
other
sciences
in
the
fact
of
a
certain
kind
of
liberty
belonging
to
society
in
the
exercise
of
its
higher
functions
he
says
further
if
this
view
be
correct
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
follow
in
the
steps
of
comte
and
spencer
and
transfer
bodily
and
the
conceptions
and
the
methods
of
the
natural
sciences
into
the
science
of
society
for
here
the
fact
of
entails
a
reaction
of
the
whole
assemblage
of
social
phenomena
upon
themselves
such
as
the
natural
sciences
have
no
example
of
and
he
concludes
sociology
ought
therefore
to
guard
carefully
against
the
tendency
to
crystallise
that
which
is
essentially
fluid
and
moving
the
tendency
to
consider
as
given
fact
or
dead
data
that
which
creates
itself
and
gives
itself
into
the
world
of
phenomena
continually
by
force
of
its
own
ideal
conception
these
opinions
do
in
their
various
keys
sound
a
similar
to
mine
if
indeed
the
tendency
of
these
remarks
is
justifiable
then
unavoidably
the
subjective
element
which
is
beauty
must
coalesce
with
the
objective
which
is
truth
and
sociology
mast
be
neither
art
simply
nor
science
in
the
narrow
meaning
of
the
word
at
all
but
knowledge
rendered
imaginatively
and
with
an
element
of
personality
that
is
to
say
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
term
literature
if
this
contention
is
sound
if
therefore
we
boldly
set
aside
comte
and
spencer
altogether
as
interlopers
rather
than
the
authoritative
parents
of
sociology
we
shall
have
to
substitute
for
the
classifications
of
the
social
sciences
an
inquiry
into
the
chief
literary
forms
that
subserve
sociological
purposes
of
these
there
are
two
one
invariably
recognised
as
valuable
and
one
which
i
think
under
the
scientific
obsession
is
altogether
underrated
and
neglected
the
first
which
is
the
social
side
of
history
makes
up
the
bulk
of
valid
sociological
work
at
the
present
time
of
history
there
is
the
purely
descriptive
part
the
detailed
account
of
past
or
contemporary
social
conditions
or
of
the
sequence
of
such
conditions
and
in
addition
there
is
the
sort
of
historical
literature
that
seeks
to
elucidate
and
impose
general
interpretations
upon
the
complex
of
occurrences
and
institutions
to
establish
broad
historical
generalisations
to
eliminate
the
mass
of
irrelevant
incident
to
present
some
great
period
of
history
or
all
history
in
the
light
of
one
dramatic
sequence
or
as
one
process
this
beattie
crozier
for
example
attempts
in
his
history
of
intellectual
development
equally
comprehensive
is
buckle
history
of
civilisation
lecky
history
of
european
morals
during
the
onset
of
christianity
again
is
essentially
sociology
numerous
works
atkinson
primal
law
and
andrew
social
origins
for
example
may
be
considered
as
it
were
to
be
fragments
to
the
same
purport
in
the
great
design
of
gibbon
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
or
carlyle
french
revolution
you
have
a
greater
insistence
upon
the
dramatic
and
picturesque
elements
in
history
but
in
other
respects
an
altogether
kindred
endeavour
to
impose
upon
the
vast
confusions
of
the
past
a
scheme
of
interpretation
valuable
just
to
the
extent
of
its
literary
value
of
the
success
with
which
the
discrepant
masses
have
been
fused
and
cast
into
the
shape
the
insight
of
the
writer
has
determined
the
writing
of
great
history
is
entirely
analogous
to
fine
portraiture
in
which
fact
is
indeed
material
but
material
entirely
subordinate
to
vision
one
main
branch
of
the
work
of
a
sociological
society
therefore
should
surely
be
to
accept
and
render
acceptable
to
provide
understanding
criticism
and
stimulus
for
such
literary
activities
as
restore
the
dead
bones
of
the
past
to
a
living
participation
in
our
lives
but
it
is
in
the
second
and
at
present
neglected
direction
that
i
believe
the
predominant
attack
upon
the
problem
implied
by
the
word
sociology
must
lie
the
attack
that
must
be
finally
driven
home
there
is
no
such
thing
in
sociology
as
dispassionately
considering
what
without
considering
what
is
to
in
sociology
beyond
any
possibility
of
evasion
ideas
are
facts
the
history
of
civilisation
is
really
the
history
of
the
appearance
and
reappearance
the
tentatives
and
hesitations
and
alterations
the
manifestations
and
reflections
in
this
mind
and
that
of
a
very
complex
imperfect
elusive
idea
the
social
idea
it
is
that
idea
struggling
to
exist
and
realise
itself
in
a
world
of
egotisms
animalisms
and
brute
matter
now
i
submit
it
is
not
only
a
legitimate
form
of
approach
but
altogether
the
most
promising
and
hopeful
form
of
approach
to
endeavour
to
disentangle
and
express
one
personal
version
of
that
idea
and
to
measure
realities
from
the
of
that
idealisation
i
think
in
fact
that
the
creation
of
utopias
and
their
exhaustive
criticism
is
the
proper
and
distinctive
method
of
sociology
suppose
now
the
sociological
society
or
some
considerable
proportion
of
it
were
to
adopt
this
view
that
sociology
is
the
description
of
the
ideal
society
and
its
relation
to
existing
societies
would
not
this
give
the
synthetic
framework
professor
durkheim
for
example
has
said
to
be
needed
almost
all
the
sociological
literature
beyond
the
province
of
history
that
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
established
itself
in
the
esteem
of
men
is
frankly
utopian
plato
when
his
mind
turned
to
schemes
of
social
reconstruction
thrust
his
habitual
form
of
dialogue
into
a
corner
both
the
republic
and
the
laws
are
practically
utopias
in
monologue
and
aristotle
found
the
criticism
of
the
utopian
suggestions
of
his
predecessors
richly
profitable
directly
the
mind
of
the
world
emerged
again
at
the
renascence
from
intellectual
barbarism
in
the
brief
breathing
time
before
sturm
and
the
schoolmasters
caught
it
and
birched
it
into
scholarship
and
a
new
period
of
sterility
it
went
on
from
plato
to
the
making
of
fresh
utopias
not
without
profit
did
more
discuss
pauperism
in
this
form
and
bacon
the
organisation
of
research
and
the
yeast
of
the
french
revolution
was
utopias
even
comte
all
the
while
that
he
is
professing
science
fact
precision
is
adding
detail
after
detail
to
the
intensely
personal
utopia
of
a
western
republic
that
constitutes
his
one
meritorious
gift
to
the
world
sociologists
can
not
help
making
utopias
though
they
avoid
the
word
though
they
deny
the
idea
with
passion
their
very
silences
shape
a
utopia
why
should
they
not
follow
the
precedent
of
aristotle
and
accept
utopias
as
material
there
used
to
be
in
my
student
days
and
probably
still
flourishes
a
most
valuable
summary
of
fact
and
theory
in
comparative
anatomy
called
rolleston
forms
of
animal
life
i
figure
to
myself
a
similar
book
a
sort
of
dream
book
of
huge
dimensions
in
reality
perhaps
dispersed
in
many
volumes
by
many
hands
upon
the
ideal
society
this
book
this
picture
of
the
perfect
state
would
be
the
backbone
of
sociology
it
would
have
great
sections
devoted
to
such
questions
as
the
extent
of
the
ideal
society
its
relation
to
racial
differences
the
relations
of
the
sexes
in
it
its
economic
organisations
its
organisation
for
thought
and
education
its
bible
as
beattie
crozier
would
say
its
housing
and
social
atmosphere
and
so
forth
almost
all
the
divaricating
work
at
present
roughly
classed
together
as
sociological
could
be
brought
into
relation
in
the
simplest
manner
either
as
new
suggestions
as
new
discussion
or
criticism
as
newly
ascertained
facts
bearing
upon
such
discussions
and
sustaining
or
eliminating
suggestions
the
institutions
of
existing
states
would
come
into
comparison
with
the
institutions
of
the
ideal
state
their
failures
and
defects
would
be
criticised
most
effectually
in
that
relation
and
the
whole
science
of
collective
psychology
the
psychology
of
human
association
would
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
question
of
the
practicability
of
this
proposed
ideal
this
method
would
give
not
only
a
boundary
shape
to
all
sociological
activities
but
a
scheme
of
arrangement
for
text
books
and
lectures
and
points
of
direction
and
reference
for
the
graduation
and
post
graduate
work
of
sociological
students
only
one
group
of
inquiries
commonly
classed
as
sociological
would
have
to
be
left
out
of
direct
relationship
with
this
ideal
state
and
that
is
inquiries
concerning
the
rough
expedients
to
meet
the
failure
of
imperfect
institutions
social
emergency
work
of
all
sorts
comes
under
this
head
what
to
do
with
the
pariah
dogs
of
constantinople
what
to
do
with
the
tramps
who
sleep
in
the
london
parks
how
to
organise
a
soup
kitchen
or
a
bible
coffee
van
how
to
prevent
ignorant
people
who
have
nothing
else
to
do
getting
drunk
in
are
no
doubt
serious
questions
for
the
practical
administrator
questions
of
primary
importance
to
the
politician
but
they
have
no
more
to
do
with
sociology
than
the
erection
of
a
temporary
hospital
after
the
collision
of
two
trains
has
to
do
with
railway
engineering
so
much
for
my
second
and
most
central
and
essential
portion
of
sociological
work
it
should
be
evident
that
the
former
part
the
historical
part
which
conceivably
will
be
much
the
bulkier
and
more
abundant
of
the
two
will
in
effect
amount
to
a
history
of
the
suggestions
in
circumstance
and
experience
of
that
idea
of
society
of
which
the
second
will
consist
and
of
the
instructive
failures
in
attempting
its
incomplete
realisation
divorce
the
time
is
fast
approaching
when
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
general
citizen
to
form
definite
opinions
upon
proposals
for
probably
quite
extensive
alterations
of
our
present
divorce
laws
arising
out
of
the
recommendations
of
the
recent
royal
commission
on
the
subject
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
therefore
to
run
through
some
of
the
chief
points
that
are
likely
to
be
raised
and
to
set
out
the
main
considerations
affecting
these
issues
divorce
is
not
one
of
those
things
that
stand
alone
and
neither
divorce
law
nor
the
general
principles
of
divorce
are
to
be
discussed
without
a
reference
to
antecedent
arrangements
divorce
is
a
sequel
to
marriage
and
a
change
in
the
divorce
law
is
essentially
a
change
in
the
marriage
law
there
was
a
time
in
this
country
when
our
marriage
was
a
practically
divorceless
bond
soluble
only
under
extraordinary
circumstances
by
people
in
situations
of
exceptional
advantage
for
doing
so
now
it
is
a
bond
under
conditions
and
in
the
event
of
the
adultery
of
the
wife
or
of
the
adultery
plus
cruelty
or
plus
desertion
of
the
husband
and
of
one
or
two
other
rarer
and
more
dreadful
offences
it
can
be
broken
at
the
instance
of
the
aggrieved
party
a
change
in
the
divorce
law
is
a
change
in
the
dissolution
clauses
so
to
speak
of
the
contract
for
the
marriage
partnership
it
is
a
change
in
the
marriage
law
a
great
number
of
people
object
to
divorce
under
any
circumstances
whatever
this
is
the
case
with
the
orthodox
catholic
and
with
the
orthodox
positivist
and
many
religious
and
orthodox
people
carry
their
assertion
of
the
indissolubility
of
marriage
to
the
grave
they
demand
that
the
widow
or
widower
shall
remain
unmarried
faithful
to
the
vows
made
at
the
altar
until
death
comes
to
the
release
of
the
lonely
survivor
also
is
regarded
by
such
people
as
a
posthumous
bigamy
there
is
certainly
a
very
strong
and
logical
case
to
be
made
out
for
a
marriage
bond
that
is
indissoluble
even
by
death
it
banishes
from
the
world
it
confers
a
dignity
of
tragic
inevitability
upon
the
association
of
husband
and
wife
and
makes
a
love
approach
the
gravest
most
momentous
thing
in
life
it
banishes
for
ever
any
dream
of
escape
from
the
presence
and
service
of
either
party
or
of
any
separation
from
the
children
of
the
union
it
affords
no
alternative
to
making
the
best
of
it
for
either
husband
or
wife
they
have
taken
a
step
as
irrevocable
as
suicide
and
some
logical
minds
would
even
go
further
and
have
no
law
as
between
the
members
of
a
family
no
rights
no
private
property
within
that
limit
the
family
would
be
the
social
unit
and
the
father
its
public
representative
and
though
the
law
might
intervene
if
he
murdered
or
wife
or
children
or
they
him
it
would
do
so
in
just
the
same
spirit
that
it
might
prevent
him
from
or
attempted
suicide
for
the
good
of
the
state
simply
and
not
to
defend
any
supposed
independence
of
the
injured
member
there
is
much
i
assert
to
be
said
for
such
a
complete
shutting
up
of
the
family
from
the
interference
of
the
law
and
not
the
least
among
these
reasons
is
the
entire
harmony
of
such
a
view
with
the
passionate
instincts
of
the
natural
man
and
woman
in
these
matters
all
unsophisticated
human
beings
appear
disposed
to
a
fierce
proprietorship
in
their
children
and
their
sexual
partners
and
in
no
respect
is
the
ordinary
mortal
so
easily
induced
to
vehemence
and
violence
for
my
own
part
i
do
not
think
the
maintenance
of
a
marriage
that
is
indissoluble
that
precludes
the
survivor
from
that
gives
neither
party
an
external
refuge
from
the
misbehaviour
of
the
other
and
makes
the
children
the
absolute
property
of
their
parents
until
they
grow
up
would
cause
any
very
general
unhappiness
most
people
are
reasonable
enough
enough
and
adaptable
enough
to
shake
down
even
in
a
grip
so
rigid
and
i
would
even
go
further
and
say
that
its
very
rigidity
the
entire
absence
of
any
way
out
at
all
would
oblige
innumerable
people
to
accommodate
themselves
to
its
conditions
and
make
a
working
success
of
unions
that
under
laxer
conditions
would
be
almost
certainly
dissolved
we
should
have
more
people
of
what
i
may
call
the
type
than
an
easier
release
would
create
but
to
many
thinkers
the
spectacle
of
a
human
being
thoroughly
is
in
itself
extremely
satisfactory
a
few
more
crimes
of
desperation
perhaps
might
occur
to
balance
against
an
almost
universal
effort
to
achieve
contentment
and
reconciliation
we
should
hear
more
of
the
natural
law
permitting
murder
by
the
jealous
husband
or
by
the
jealous
wife
and
the
traffic
in
poisons
would
need
a
sedulous
attention
but
even
there
the
impossibility
of
would
operate
to
restrain
the
impatient
on
the
whole
i
can
imagine
the
world
rubbing
along
very
well
with
marriage
as
unaccommodating
as
a
perfected
steel
trap
exceptional
people
might
suffer
or
sin
wildly
to
the
general
amusement
or
indignation
but
when
once
we
part
from
the
idea
of
such
a
rigid
and
eternal
marriage
bond
and
the
law
of
every
civilised
country
and
the
general
thought
and
sentiment
everywhere
have
long
since
done
so
then
the
whole
question
changes
if
marriage
is
not
so
absolutely
sacred
a
bond
if
it
is
not
an
eternal
bond
but
a
bond
we
may
break
on
this
account
or
that
then
at
once
we
put
the
question
on
a
different
footing
if
we
may
terminate
it
for
adultery
or
cruelty
or
any
cause
whatever
if
we
may
suspend
the
intimacy
of
husband
and
wife
by
separation
orders
and
the
like
if
we
recognise
their
separate
property
and
interfere
between
them
and
their
children
to
ensure
the
health
and
education
of
the
latter
then
we
open
at
once
the
whole
question
of
a
terminating
agreement
marriage
ceases
to
be
an
unlimited
union
and
becomes
a
definite
contract
we
raise
the
whole
question
of
what
are
the
limits
in
marriage
and
how
and
when
may
a
marriage
terminate
now
many
answers
are
being
given
to
that
question
at
the
present
time
we
may
take
as
the
extremest
opposite
to
the
eternal
marriage
idea
the
proposal
of
bernard
shaw
that
marriage
should
be
terminable
at
the
instance
of
either
party
you
would
give
due
and
public
notice
that
your
marriage
was
at
an
end
and
it
would
be
at
an
end
this
is
marriage
at
its
minimum
as
the
eternal
indissoluble
marriage
is
marriage
at
its
maximum
and
the
only
conceivable
next
step
would
be
to
have
a
marriage
makeable
by
the
oral
declaration
of
both
parties
and
terminable
by
the
oral
declaration
of
either
which
would
be
indeed
no
marriage
at
all
but
an
encounter
you
might
marry
a
dozen
times
in
that
way
in
a
day
somewhere
between
these
extremes
lies
the
marriage
law
of
a
civilised
state
let
us
rather
than
working
down
from
the
eternal
marriage
of
the
religious
idealists
work
up
from
shaw
the
former
course
is
perhaps
inevitable
for
the
legislator
but
the
latter
is
much
more
convenient
for
our
discussion
now
the
idea
of
a
divorce
so
easy
and
wilful
as
shaw
proposes
arises
naturally
out
of
an
exclusive
consideration
of
what
i
may
call
the
amorous
sentimentalities
of
marriage
if
you
regard
marriage
as
merely
the
union
of
two
people
in
love
then
clearly
it
is
intolerable
an
outrage
upon
human
dignity
that
they
should
remain
intimately
united
when
either
ceases
to
love
and
in
that
world
of
shaw
dreams
in
which
everybody
is
to
have
an
equal
income
and
nobody
is
to
have
children
in
that
culminating
conversazione
of
humanity
his
marriage
law
will
no
doubt
work
with
the
most
admirable
results
but
if
we
make
a
step
towards
reality
and
consider
a
world
in
which
incomes
are
unequal
and
economic
difficulties
abound
for
the
present
we
will
ignore
the
complication
of
offspring
we
at
once
find
it
necessary
to
modify
the
first
fine
simplicity
of
divorce
at
either
partner
request
marriage
is
almost
always
a
serious
economic
disturbance
for
both
man
and
woman
work
has
to
be
given
up
and
rearranged
resources
have
to
be
pooled
only
in
the
rarest
cases
does
it
escape
becoming
an
indefinite
business
partnership
accordingly
the
withdrawal
of
one
partner
raises
at
once
all
sorts
of
questions
of
financial
adjustment
compensation
for
physical
mental
and
moral
damage
division
of
furniture
and
effects
and
so
forth
no
doubt
a
very
large
part
of
this
could
be
met
if
there
existed
some
sort
of
marriage
settlement
providing
for
the
dissolution
of
the
partnership
otherwise
the
petitioner
for
a
divorce
must
be
prepared
for
the
most
exhaustive
and
penetrating
examination
before
say
a
court
of
three
assessors
representing
severally
the
husband
the
wife
and
justice
to
determine
the
distribution
of
the
separation
this
point
however
leads
me
to
note
in
passing
the
need
that
does
exist
even
for
a
more
precise
business
supplement
to
marriage
as
we
know
it
in
england
and
america
i
think
there
ought
to
be
a
very
definite
and
elaborate
treaty
of
partnership
drawn
up
by
an
impartial
private
tribunal
for
every
couple
that
marries
providing
for
most
of
the
eventualities
of
life
taking
cognizance
of
the
earning
power
the
property
and
prospects
of
either
party
insisting
upon
due
insurances
ensuring
private
incomes
for
each
partner
securing
the
welfare
of
the
children
and
laying
down
equitable
conditions
in
the
event
of
a
divorce
or
separation
such
a
treaty
ought
to
be
a
necessary
prelude
to
the
issue
of
a
licence
to
marry
and
given
such
a
basis
to
go
upon
then
i
see
no
reason
why
in
the
case
of
couples
who
remain
childless
for
five
or
six
years
let
us
say
and
seem
likely
to
remain
childless
the
divorce
at
the
instance
of
either
party
without
reason
assigned
should
not
be
a
very
excellent
thing
indeed
and
i
take
up
this
position
because
i
believe
in
the
family
as
the
justification
of
marriage
marriage
to
me
is
no
mystical
and
eternal
union
but
a
practical
affair
to
be
judged
as
all
practical
things
are
judged
by
its
returns
in
happiness
and
human
welfare
and
directly
we
pass
from
the
mists
and
glamours
of
amorous
passion
to
the
warm
realities
of
the
nursery
we
pass
into
a
new
system
of
considerations
altogether
we
are
no
longer
considering
in
relation
to
but
and
in
relation
to
an
indefinite
number
of
little
a
who
are
the
very
life
of
the
state
in
which
they
live
into
the
case
of
a
come
master
and
miss
intervening
they
have
the
strongest
claim
against
both
their
parents
for
love
shelter
and
upbringing
and
the
legislator
and
statesman
concerned
as
he
is
chiefly
with
the
future
of
the
community
has
the
strongest
reasons
for
seeing
that
they
get
these
things
even
at
the
price
of
considerable
vexation
boredom
or
indignity
to
and
a
and
here
it
is
that
there
arises
the
rational
case
against
free
and
frequent
divorce
and
the
general
unsettlement
and
fluctuation
of
homes
that
would
ensue
at
this
point
we
come
to
the
verge
of
a
jungle
of
questions
that
would
demand
a
whole
book
for
anything
like
a
complete
answer
let
us
try
as
swiftly
and
simply
as
possible
to
form
a
general
idea
at
least
of
the
way
through
remember
that
we
are
working
upward
from
question
of
why
not
separate
at
the
choice
of
either
party
we
have
got
thus
far
that
no
two
people
who
do
not
love
each
other
should
be
compelled
to
live
together
except
where
the
welfare
of
their
children
comes
in
to
override
their
desire
to
separate
and
now
we
have
to
consider
what
may
or
may
not
be
for
the
welfare
of
the
children
shaw
following
the
late
samuel
butler
meets
this
difficulty
by
the
most
extravagant
abuse
of
parents
he
would
have
us
believe
that
the
worst
enemies
a
child
can
have
are
its
mother
and
father
and
that
the
only
civilised
path
to
citizenship
is
by
the
incubator
the
crêche
and
the
mixed
school
and
college
in
these
matters
he
is
not
only
ignorant
but
unfeeling
and
unsympathetic
extraordinarily
so
in
view
of
his
great
capacity
for
pity
and
sweetness
in
other
directions
and
of
his
indignant
hatred
of
cruelty
and
unfairness
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
waste
time
in
discussing
what
the
common
experience
confutes
neither
is
it
necessary
to
fly
to
the
other
extreme
and
indulge
in
preposterous
sentimentalities
about
the
magic
of
fatherhood
and
a
mother
love
these
are
not
magic
and
unlimited
things
but
touchingly
qualified
and
human
things
the
temperate
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
in
most
parents
there
are
great
stores
of
pride
interest
natural
sympathy
passionate
love
and
devotion
which
can
be
tapped
in
the
interests
of
the
children
and
the
social
future
and
that
it
is
the
mere
commonsense
of
statecraft
to
use
their
resources
to
the
utmost
it
does
not
follow
that
every
parent
contains
these
reservoirs
and
that
a
continual
close
association
with
the
parents
is
always
beneficial
to
children
if
it
did
we
should
have
to
prosecute
everyone
who
employed
a
governess
or
sent
away
a
little
boy
to
a
preparatory
school
and
our
real
task
is
to
establish
a
test
that
will
gauge
the
desirability
and
benefit
of
a
continued
parentage
there
are
certainly
parents
and
homes
from
which
the
children
might
be
taken
with
infinite
benefit
to
themselves
and
to
society
and
whose
union
it
is
ridiculous
to
save
from
the
divorce
court
shears
suppose
now
we
made
the
willingness
of
a
parent
to
give
up
his
or
her
children
the
measure
of
his
beneficialness
to
them
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
restrict
divorce
only
to
the
relation
of
husband
and
wife
let
us
broaden
the
word
and
make
it
conceivable
for
a
husband
or
wife
to
divorce
not
only
the
partner
but
the
children
then
it
might
be
possible
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
extremist
up
to
the
point
of
permitting
a
married
parent
who
desired
freedom
to
petition
for
a
divorce
not
from
his
or
her
partner
simply
but
from
his
or
her
family
and
even
for
a
widow
or
widower
to
divorce
a
family
then
would
come
the
task
of
the
assessors
they
would
make
arrangements
for
the
dissolution
of
the
relationship
erring
from
justice
rather
in
the
direction
of
liberality
towards
the
divorced
group
they
would
determine
contributions
exact
securities
appoint
trustees
and
guardians
on
the
whole
i
do
not
see
why
such
a
system
should
not
work
very
well
it
would
break
up
many
loveless
homes
quarrelling
and
bickering
homes
and
give
a
for
that
hate
which
is
the
sinister
shadow
of
love
i
do
not
think
it
would
separate
one
child
from
one
parent
who
was
really
worthy
of
its
possession
so
far
i
have
discussed
only
the
possibility
of
divorce
without
offences
the
sort
of
divorce
that
arises
out
of
estrangement
and
incompatibilities
but
divorce
as
it
is
known
in
most
christian
countries
has
a
punitive
element
and
is
obtained
through
the
failure
of
one
of
the
parties
to
observe
the
conditions
of
the
bond
and
the
determination
of
the
other
to
exact
suffering
divorce
as
it
exists
at
present
is
not
a
readjustment
but
a
revenge
it
is
the
nasty
exposure
of
a
private
wrong
in
england
a
husband
may
divorce
his
wife
for
a
single
act
of
infidelity
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
we
are
on
the
eve
of
an
equalisation
of
the
law
in
this
respect
i
will
confess
i
consider
this
an
extreme
concession
to
the
passion
of
jealousy
and
one
likely
to
tear
off
the
roof
from
many
a
family
of
innocent
children
only
infidelity
leading
to
supposititious
children
in
the
case
of
the
wife
or
infidelity
obstinately
and
offensively
persisted
in
or
endangering
health
in
the
case
of
the
husband
really
injure
the
home
sufficiently
to
justify
a
divorce
on
the
assumptions
of
our
present
argument
if
we
are
going
to
make
the
welfare
of
the
children
our
criterion
in
these
matters
then
our
divorce
law
does
in
this
direction
already
go
too
far
a
husband
or
wife
may
do
far
more
injury
to
the
home
by
constantly
neglecting
it
for
the
companionship
of
some
outside
person
with
whom
no
matrimonial
offence
is
ever
committed
of
course
if
our
divorce
law
exists
mainly
for
the
gratification
of
the
fiercer
sexual
resentments
well
and
good
but
if
that
is
so
let
us
abandon
our
pretence
that
marriage
is
an
institution
for
the
establishment
and
protection
of
homes
and
while
on
the
one
hand
existing
divorce
laws
appear
to
be
obsessed
by
sexual
offences
other
things
of
far
more
evil
effect
upon
the
home
go
without
a
remedy
there
are
for
example
desertion
domestic
neglect
cruelty
to
the
children
drunkenness
or
harmful
indecency
of
living
and
uncontrollable
extravagance
i
can
not
conceive
how
any
logical
mind
having
once
admitted
the
principle
of
divorce
can
hesitate
at
making
these
entirely
things
the
basis
of
effective
pleas
but
in
another
direction
some
strain
of
sentimentality
in
my
nature
makes
me
hesitate
to
go
with
the
great
majority
of
divorce
law
reformers
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
agree
that
either
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
or
the
misfortune
of
insanity
should
in
itself
justify
a
divorce
i
admit
the
social
convenience
but
i
wince
at
the
thought
of
those
tragic
returns
of
the
dispossessed
so
far
as
insanity
goes
i
perceive
that
the
cruelty
of
the
law
would
but
endorse
the
cruelty
of
nature
but
i
do
not
like
men
to
endorse
the
cruelty
of
nature
and
of
course
there
is
no
person
nowadays
but
wants
to
put
an
end
to
that
ugly
blot
upon
our
civilisation
the
publication
of
whatever
is
most
spicy
and
painful
in
divorce
court
proceedings
it
is
an
outrage
which
falls
even
more
heavily
on
the
innocent
than
on
the
guilty
and
which
has
deterred
hundreds
of
shy
and
people
from
seeking
legal
remedies
for
nearly
intolerable
wrongs
the
sort
of
person
who
goes
willingly
to
the
divorce
court
is
the
sort
of
person
who
would
love
a
screaming
quarrel
in
a
crowded
street
the
emotional
breach
of
the
marriage
bond
is
as
private
an
affair
as
its
consummation
and
it
would
be
nearly
as
righteous
to
subject
young
couples
about
to
marry
to
a
blustering
by
some
underbred
bully
of
a
barrister
upon
their
motives
and
then
to
publish
whatever
chance
phrases
in
their
answers
appeared
to
be
amusing
in
the
press
as
it
is
to
publish
contemporary
divorce
proceedings
the
thing
is
a
nastiness
a
stream
of
social
contagion
and
an
extreme
cruelty
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
whatever
other
result
this
british
royal
commission
may
have
there
at
least
will
be
many
sweeping
alterations
the
schoolmaster
and
the
empire
sec
if
youth
but
knew
is
the
title
of
a
book
published
some
years
ago
but
still
with
a
quite
living
interest
by
kappa
it
is
the
bitter
complaint
of
a
distressed
senior
against
our
educational
system
he
is
hugely
disappointed
in
the
boy
and
more
particularly
in
one
typical
specimen
he
is
if
one
might
hazard
a
guess
an
uncle
bereft
of
great
expectations
he
finds
an
echo
in
thousands
of
other
distressed
uncles
and
parents
they
use
the
most
divergent
and
inadequate
forms
of
expression
for
this
vague
sense
that
the
result
has
not
come
out
good
enough
they
put
it
contradictorily
and
often
wrongly
but
the
sense
is
widespread
and
real
and
justifiable
and
we
owe
a
great
debt
to
kappa
for
an
accurate
diagnosis
of
what
in
the
aggregate
amounts
to
a
grave
national
and
social
evil
the
trouble
with
kappa
particular
boy
is
his
unlit
imagination
the
apathetic
commonness
of
his
attitude
to
life
at
large
he
is
almost
stupidly
not
interested
in
the
mysteries
of
material
fact
nor
in
the
riddles
and
great
dramatic
movements
of
history
indifferent
to
any
form
of
beauty
and
pedantically
devoted
to
the
pettiness
of
games
and
clothing
and
social
conduct
it
is
in
fact
chiefly
by
his
style
in
these
latter
things
his
extensive
unilluminated
knowledge
of
greek
and
latin
and
his
greater
costliness
that
he
differs
from
a
young
carpenter
or
clerk
a
young
carpenter
or
clerk
of
the
same
temperament
would
have
no
narrower
prejudices
nor
outlook
no
less
capacity
for
the
discussion
of
broad
questions
and
for
imaginative
thinking
and
it
has
come
to
the
mind
of
kappa
as
a
discovery
as
an
exceedingly
remarkable
and
moving
thing
a
thing
to
cry
aloud
about
that
this
should
be
so
that
this
is
all
that
the
best
possible
modern
education
has
achieved
he
makes
it
more
than
a
personal
issue
he
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
not
an
exceptional
case
at
all
but
a
fair
sample
of
what
our
education
does
for
the
imagination
of
those
who
must
presently
take
the
lead
among
us
he
declares
plainly
that
we
are
raising
a
generation
of
rulers
and
of
those
with
whom
the
duty
of
initiative
should
chiefly
reside
who
have
minds
atrophied
by
dull
studies
and
deadening
suggestions
and
he
thinks
that
this
is
a
matter
of
the
gravest
concern
for
the
future
of
this
land
and
empire
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
agreeing
with
him
either
in
his
observation
or
in
his
conclusion
anyone
who
has
seen
much
of
undergraduates
or
medical
students
or
army
candidates
and
also
of
their
social
subordinates
must
be
disposed
to
agree
that
the
difference
between
the
two
classes
is
mainly
in
unimportant
things
in
polish
in
manner
in
superficialities
of
accent
and
vocabulary
and
social
habit
and
that
their
minds
in
range
and
power
are
very
much
on
a
level
with
an
invincibly
aristocratic
tradition
we
are
failing
altogether
to
produce
a
leader
class
adequate
to
modern
needs
the
state
is
but
while
one
agrees
with
kappa
and
shares
his
alarm
one
must
confess
the
remedies
he
considers
indicated
do
not
seem
quite
so
satisfactory
as
his
diagnosis
of
the
disease
he
attacks
the
curriculum
and
tells
us
we
must
reduce
or
revolutionise
instruction
and
exercise
in
the
dead
languages
introduce
a
broader
handling
of
history
a
more
inspiring
arrangement
of
scientific
courses
and
so
forth
i
wish
indeed
it
were
possible
to
believe
that
substituting
biology
for
greek
prose
composition
or
history
with
models
and
photographs
and
diagrams
for
latin
versification
would
make
any
considerable
difference
in
this
matter
for
so
one
might
discuss
this
question
and
still
give
no
offence
to
a
most
amiable
and
influential
class
of
men
but
the
roots
of
the
evil
the
ultimate
cause
of
that
typical
young
man
deadness
lie
not
at
all
in
that
direction
to
indicate
the
direction
in
which
it
does
lie
is
quite
unavoidably
to
give
offence
to
an
indiscriminatingly
sensitive
class
yet
there
is
need
to
speak
plainly
this
deadening
of
soul
comes
not
from
the
omission
or
inclusion
of
this
specific
subject
or
that
it
is
the
effect
of
the
general
scholastic
atmosphere
it
is
an
atmosphere
that
admits
of
no
inspiration
at
all
it
is
an
atmosphere
from
which
living
stimulating
influences
have
been
excluded
from
which
stimulating
and
vigorous
personalities
are
now
being
carefully
eliminated
and
in
which
dull
prosaic
men
prevail
invincibly
the
explanation
of
the
inert
commonness
of
kappa
schoolboy
lies
not
in
his
having
learnt
this
or
not
learnt
that
but
in
the
fact
that
from
seven
to
twenty
he
has
been
in
the
intellectual
shadow
of
a
number
of
sedulously
respectable
conscientiously
manly
conforming
men
who
never
to
the
knowledge
of
their
pupils
and
the
public
at
any
rate
think
strange
thoughts
do
imaginative
or
romantic
things
pay
tribute
to
beauty
laugh
carelessly
or
countenance
any
irregularity
in
the
world
all
erratic
and
enterprising
tendencies
in
him
have
been
checked
by
them
and
brought
at
last
to
nothing
and
so
he
emerges
a
mere
residuum
of
decent
minor
dispositions
the
dullness
of
the
scholastic
atmosphere
the
grey
intolerant
mediocrity
that
is
the
natural
or
assumed
quality
of
every
schoolmaster
is
the
true
cause
of
the
spiritual
etiolation
of
kappa
young
friend
now
it
is
a
very
grave
thing
i
know
to
bring
this
charge
against
a
great
profession
to
say
as
i
do
say
that
it
is
collectively
and
individually
dull
but
someone
has
to
do
this
sooner
or
later
we
have
restrained
ourselves
and
argued
away
from
the
question
too
long
there
is
i
allege
a
great
lack
of
vigorous
and
inspiring
minds
in
our
schools
our
schools
are
out
of
touch
with
the
thought
of
the
time
in
a
backwater
of
intellectual
apathy
we
have
no
original
or
heroic
let
me
ask
the
reader
frankly
what
part
our
leading
headmasters
play
in
his
intellectual
world
if
when
some
prominent
one
among
them
speaks
or
writes
or
talks
he
expects
anything
more
than
platitudes
and
little
things
has
he
ever
turned
aside
to
learn
what
this
headmaster
or
that
thought
of
any
question
that
interested
him
has
he
ever
found
freshness
or
power
in
a
discourse
or
found
a
schoolmaster
caring
keenly
for
fine
and
beautiful
things
who
does
not
know
the
schoolmaster
trite
safe
admirations
his
thin
evasive
discussion
his
sham
enthusiasms
for
cricket
for
for
perpendicular
architecture
for
boyish
traits
his
timid
refuge
in
good
form
his
deadly
silences
and
if
we
do
not
find
him
a
refreshing
and
inspiring
person
and
his
mind
a
fountain
of
thought
in
which
we
bathe
and
are
restored
is
it
likely
our
sons
will
if
the
schoolmaster
at
large
is
grey
and
dull
shirking
interesting
topics
and
emphatic
speech
what
must
he
be
like
in
the
monotonous
these
may
seem
wanton
charges
to
some
but
i
am
not
speaking
without
my
book
monthly
i
am
brought
into
close
contact
with
the
pedagogic
intelligence
through
the
medium
of
three
educational
magazines
a
certain
morbid
habit
against
which
i
struggle
in
vain
makes
me
read
everything
i
catch
a
schoolmaster
writing
i
am
indeed
one
of
the
faithful
band
who
read
the
educational
supplement
of
the
in
these
papers
schoolmasters
write
about
their
business
lectures
upon
the
questions
of
their
calling
are
reported
at
length
and
a
sort
of
invalid
discussion
moves
with
painful
decorum
through
the
correspondence
column
the
scholastic
mind
so
displayed
in
action
fascinates
me
it
is
like
watching
a
game
of
billiards
with
wooden
cushes
and
beechwood
balls
sec
but
let
me
take
one
special
instance
in
a
periodical
now
no
longer
living
called
the
there
appeared
some
years
ago
a
very
curious
and
typical
contribution
by
the
headmaster
of
dulwich
which
i
may
perhaps
use
as
an
illustration
of
the
mental
habits
which
seem
inseparably
associated
with
modern
scholastic
work
it
is
called
english
ideas
on
education
and
it
begins
trite
imitative
undistinguished
thus
the
most
important
question
in
a
country
is
that
of
education
and
the
most
important
people
in
a
country
are
those
who
educate
its
inhabitants
others
have
most
of
the
present
in
their
hands
those
who
educate
have
all
the
future
with
the
present
is
bound
up
all
the
happiness
only
of
the
utterly
selfish
and
the
thoughtless
among
mankind
on
the
future
rest
all
the
thoughts
of
every
parent
and
every
wise
man
and
patriot
it
is
the
opening
of
a
boy
essay
and
from
first
to
last
this
remarkable
composition
is
at
or
below
that
level
it
is
an
entirely
inconclusive
paper
it
is
impossible
to
understand
why
it
was
written
it
quotes
nothing
it
says
nothing
about
and
was
probably
written
in
ignorance
of
kappa
or
any
other
modern
contributor
to
english
ideas
and
it
occupied
about
six
and
a
quarter
of
the
pages
of
this
now
vanished
english
ideas
on
education
this
very
brevity
is
eloquent
the
more
so
since
the
style
is
by
no
means
succinct
it
must
be
read
to
be
believed
it
is
quite
extraordinarily
in
quality
and
substance
nothing
is
gripped
and
maintained
and
developed
it
is
like
the
passing
of
a
lax
hand
over
the
surfaces
of
disarranged
things
it
is
difficult
to
read
because
mind
slips
over
it
and
emerges
too
soon
at
the
end
mildly
puzzled
though
incurious
still
as
to
what
it
is
all
about
one
perceives
gilkes
through
a
fog
dimly
thinking
that
greek
has
something
vital
to
do
with
a
knowledge
of
language
and
man
that
the
classical
master
is
in
some
mysterious
way
superior
to
the
science
man
and
more
imaginative
and
that
science
men
ought
not
to
be
worried
with
the
greek
that
is
too
high
for
them
and
he
seems
too
to
be
under
the
odd
illusion
that
on
all
this
englishmen
seem
now
to
be
nearly
in
agreement
and
also
on
the
opinion
that
games
are
a
little
overdone
and
that
civic
duties
and
the
use
of
the
rifle
ought
to
be
taught
statements
are
made
the
sort
of
statements
that
are
suffered
in
an
atmosphere
where
there
is
no
swift
fierce
opposition
to
be
feared
they
frill
out
into
vague
qualifications
and
butt
gently
against
other
partially
contradictory
statements
there
is
a
classification
of
minds
the
sort
of
classification
dear
to
the
essayists
made
for
the
purposes
of
the
essay
and
unknown
to
psychology
there
are
we
are
told
accurate
unimaginative
ingenious
minds
capable
of
science
and
kindred
vulgar
things
such
was
archimedes
and
vague
imaginative
minds
with
the
gift
for
language
and
for
the
treatment
of
passion
and
the
higher
indefinable
things
such
as
homer
and
gilkes
and
somehow
this
justifies
those
who
are
destined
for
science
in
dropping
greek
certain
considerations
however
loom
inconclusively
upon
this
issue
rather
like
interested
spectators
of
a
street
fight
in
a
fog
for
example
to
learn
a
language
is
valuable
in
proportion
as
the
nation
speaking
it
is
great
a
most
empty
assertion
and
no
languages
are
so
good
for
the
purpose
of
improving
style
as
the
exact
and
beautiful
languages
of
rome
and
greece
is
it
not
time
at
least
that
this
last
this
favourite
but
threadbare
article
of
the
schoolmaster
creed
was
put
away
for
good
everyone
who
has
given
any
attention
to
this
question
must
be
aware
that
the
intellectual
gesture
is
entirely
different
in
highly
inflected
languages
such
as
greek
and
latin
and
in
so
uninflected
a
language
as
english
that
learning
greek
to
improve
one
english
style
is
like
learning
to
swim
in
order
to
fence
better
and
that
familiarity
with
greek
seems
only
too
often
to
render
a
man
incapable
of
clear
strong
expression
in
english
at
all
yet
gilkes
can
permit
this
old
assertion
so
dear
to
country
rectors
and
the
classical
scholar
to
appear
within
a
column
distance
of
such
style
as
this
it
is
now
understood
that
every
subject
is
valuable
if
it
is
properly
taught
it
will
perform
that
which
as
follows
from
the
accounts
given
above
of
the
aim
of
education
is
the
work
most
important
in
the
case
of
boys
that
is
it
will
draw
out
their
faculties
and
make
them
useful
in
the
world
alert
trained
in
industry
and
able
to
understand
so
far
as
their
school
lessons
educated
them
and
make
themselves
master
of
any
subject
set
before
them
this
quotation
is
conclusive
sec
i
am
haunted
by
a
fear
that
the
careless
reader
will
think
i
am
writing
against
schoolmasters
i
am
it
is
undeniable
writing
against
their
dullness
but
it
is
i
hold
a
dullness
that
is
imposed
upon
them
by
the
conditions
under
which
they
live
indeed
i
believe
could
i
put
the
thing
directly
to
the
profession
do
you
not
yourselves
feel
needlessly
limited
and
dull
should
receive
a
majority
of
affirmative
responses
we
have
as
a
nation
a
certain
ideal
of
what
a
schoolmaster
must
be
to
that
he
must
by
art
or
nature
approximate
and
there
is
no
help
for
it
but
to
alter
our
ideal
nothing
else
of
any
wide
value
can
be
done
until
that
is
done
in
the
first
place
the
received
ideal
omits
a
most
necessary
condition
we
do
not
insist
upon
a
headmaster
or
indeed
any
of
our
academic
leaders
and
dignitaries
being
a
man
of
marked
intellectual
character
a
man
of
intellectual
distinction
it
is
assumed
rather
lightly
in
many
cases
that
he
has
done
good
work
as
they
say
the
sort
of
good
work
that
is
usually
no
good
at
all
that
increases
nothing
changes
nothing
stimulates
no
one
leads
no
whither
that
surely
must
be
altered
we
must
see
to
it
that
our
leading
schoolmasters
at
any
rate
must
be
men
of
insight
and
creative
intelligence
men
who
could
at
a
pinch
write
a
good
novel
or
produce
illuminating
criticism
or
take
an
original
part
in
theological
or
philosophical
discussion
or
do
any
of
these
minor
things
they
must
be
authentic
men
taking
a
line
of
their
own
and
capable
of
intellectual
passion
they
should
be
able
to
make
their
mark
outside
the
school
if
only
to
show
they
carry
a
living
soul
into
it
as
things
are
nothing
is
so
fatal
to
a
schoolmaster
career
as
to
do
that
and
closely
related
to
this
omission
is
our
extreme
insistence
upon
what
we
call
high
moral
character
meaning
really
something
very
like
an
entire
absence
of
moral
character
we
insist
upon
tact
conformity
and
an
unblemished
record
now
in
these
days
of
warring
opinion
these
days
of
gigantic
strange
issues
that
can
not
possibly
be
expressed
in
the
formulae
of
the
smaller
times
that
have
gone
before
tact
is
evasion
conformity
formality
and
silence
an
unblemished
record
mere
evidence
of
the
damning
burial
of
a
talent
of
life
the
sort
of
man
into
whose
hands
we
give
our
sons
minds
must
never
have
experimented
morally
or
thought
at
all
freely
or
vigorously
about
for
example
god
socialism
the
mosaic
account
of
the
creation
social
procedure
republicanism
beauty
love
or
indeed
about
anything
likely
to
interest
an
intelligent
adolescent
at
the
approach
of
all
such
things
he
must
have
acquired
the
habit
of
the
modest
cough
the
infectious
trick
of
the
nice
evasion
how
can
kappa
expect
inspiration
from
the
decorous
resultants
who
satisfy
these
conditions
what
brand
can
ever
be
lit
at
altars
that
have
borne
no
fire
and
you
find
the
secondary
schoolmaster
who
complies
with
these
restrictions
becoming
the
zealous
and
grateful
agent
of
the
tendencies
that
have
made
him
what
he
is
converting
into
a
practice
those
vague
dreads
of
idiosyncrasy
of
positive
acts
and
new
ideas
that
dictated
the
choice
of
him
and
his
rule
of
life
his
moral
teaching
amounts
to
this
to
inculcate
about
small
matters
and
evasion
about
large
and
to
cultivate
a
morbid
obsession
in
the
necessary
dawn
of
sexual
consciousness
so
far
from
wanting
to
stimulate
the
imagination
he
hates
and
dreads
it
i
find
him
perpetually
haunted
by
a
ridiculous
fear
that
boys
will
do
something
and
in
his
terror
seeking
whatever
is
dull
and
unstimulating
and
tiring
in
intellectual
work
clipping
their
reading
censoring
their
periodicals
expurgating
their
classics
substituting
the
stupid
grind
of
organised
games
for
natural
imaginative
play
persecuting
loafers
and
so
achieving
his
end
and
turning
out
at
last
passively
apathetic
obliterated
young
men
with
the
nicest
manners
and
no
spark
of
initiative
at
all
quite
safe
not
to
do
anything
for
ever
i
submit
this
may
be
a
very
good
training
for
polite
servants
but
it
is
not
the
way
to
make
masters
in
the
world
if
we
english
believe
we
are
indeed
a
masterful
people
we
must
be
prepared
to
expose
our
children
to
more
and
more
various
stimulations
than
we
do
they
must
grow
up
free
bold
adventurous
initiated
even
if
they
have
to
take
more
risks
in
the
doing
of
that
an
able
and
stimulating
teacher
is
as
rare
as
a
fine
artist
and
is
a
thing
worth
having
for
your
son
even
at
the
price
of
shocking
your
wife
by
his
lack
of
respect
for
that
magnificent
compromise
the
establishment
or
you
by
his
socialism
or
by
his
catholicism
or
darwinism
or
even
by
his
erroneous
choice
of
ties
and
collars
boys
who
are
to
be
free
masterly
men
must
hear
free
men
talking
freely
of
religion
of
philosophy
of
conduct
they
must
have
heard
men
of
this
opinion
and
that
putting
what
they
believe
before
them
with
all
the
courage
of
conviction
they
must
have
an
idea
of
will
prevailing
over
form
it
is
far
more
important
that
boys
should
learn
from
original
intellectually
keen
men
than
they
should
learn
from
perfectly
respectable
men
or
perfectly
orthodox
men
or
perfectly
nice
men
the
vital
thing
to
consider
about
your
son
schoolmaster
is
whether
he
talked
lifeless
twaddle
yesterday
by
way
of
a
lesson
and
not
whether
he
loved
unwisely
or
was
born
of
poor
parents
or
was
seen
wearing
a
in
combination
with
a
bowler
or
confessed
he
doubted
the
apostles
creed
or
called
himself
a
socialist
or
any
disgraceful
thing
like
that
so
many
years
ago
it
is
that
sort
of
thing
kappa
must
invert
if
he
wants
a
change
in
our
public
schools
you
may
arrange
and
rearrange
curricula
abolish
greek
substitute
science
it
will
not
matter
a
rap
even
those
model
canoes
of
yours
kappa
will
be
wasted
if
you
still
insist
upon
model
schoolmasters
so
long
as
we
require
our
schoolmasters
to
be
politic
conforming
undisturbing
men
setting
up
polonius
as
an
ideal
for
them
so
long
will
their
influence
deaden
the
souls
of
our
sons
the
endowment
of
motherhood
some
few
years
ago
the
fabian
society
which
has
been
so
efficient
in
keeping
english
socialism
to
the
lines
of
artfulness
and
the
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
endowment
of
motherhood
subsequently
it
repented
and
produced
a
characteristic
pamphlet
in
which
the
idea
was
presented
with
a
sort
of
minimising
furtiveness
as
a
mean
little
extension
of
outdoor
relief
these
fabian
socialists
instead
of
being
the
daring
advanced
people
they
are
supposed
to
be
are
really
in
many
things
twenty
years
behind
the
times
there
need
be
nothing
shamefaced
about
the
presentation
of
the
endowment
of
motherhood
there
is
nothing
shameful
about
it
it
is
a
plain
and
simple
idea
for
which
the
mind
of
the
man
in
the
street
has
now
been
very
completely
prepared
it
has
already
crept
into
social
legislation
to
the
extent
of
thirty
shillings
i
suppose
if
one
fact
has
been
hammered
into
us
in
the
past
two
decades
more
than
any
other
it
is
this
that
the
supply
of
children
is
falling
off
in
the
modern
state
that
births
and
particularly
births
are
not
abundant
enough
that
the
and
particularly
the
falls
steadily
below
the
needs
of
our
future
if
no
one
else
has
said
a
word
about
this
important
matter
roosevelt
would
have
sufficed
to
shout
it
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
every
civilised
community
is
drifting
towards
as
rome
drifted
into
at
the
climax
of
her
empire
well
it
is
absurd
to
go
on
building
up
a
civilisation
with
a
dwindling
supply
of
babies
in
the
cradles
and
these
not
of
the
best
possible
sort
and
so
i
suppose
there
is
hardly
an
intelligent
person
in
the
communities
who
has
not
thought
of
some
possible
remedy
from
the
naive
scoldings
of
roosevelt
and
the
more
stolid
of
the
periodicals
to
sane
and
intelligible
legislative
projects
the
reasons
for
the
fall
in
the
are
obvious
enough
it
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
individualistic
competition
of
modern
life
people
talk
of
modern
women
shirking
motherhood
but
it
would
be
a
silly
sort
of
universe
in
which
a
large
proportion
of
women
had
any
natural
and
instinctive
desire
to
shirk
motherhood
and
i
believe
a
huge
proportion
of
modern
women
are
as
passionately
predisposed
towards
motherhood
as
ever
women
were
but
modern
conditions
conspire
to
put
a
heavy
handicap
upon
parentage
and
an
enormous
premium
upon
the
partial
or
complete
evasion
of
offspring
and
that
is
where
the
clue
to
the
trouble
lies
our
social
arrangements
discourage
parentage
very
heavily
and
the
rational
thing
for
a
statesman
to
do
in
the
matter
is
not
to
grow
eloquent
but
to
do
intelligent
things
to
minimise
that
discouragement
consider
the
case
of
an
energetic
young
man
and
an
energetic
young
woman
in
our
modern
world
so
long
as
they
remain
unencumbered
they
can
subsist
on
a
comparatively
small
income
and
find
freedom
and
leisure
to
watch
for
and
follow
opportunities
of
they
can
travel
get
knowledge
and
experience
make
experiments
succeed
one
might
almost
say
the
conditions
of
success
and
in
the
modern
world
are
to
defer
marriage
as
long
as
possible
and
after
that
to
defer
parentage
as
long
as
possible
and
even
when
there
is
a
family
there
is
the
strongest
temptation
to
limit
it
to
three
or
four
children
at
the
outside
parents
who
can
give
three
children
any
opportunity
in
life
prefer
to
do
that
than
turn
out
let
us
say
eight
children
at
a
disadvantage
to
become
the
servants
and
unsuccessful
competitors
of
the
offspring
of
the
restrained
that
fact
bites
us
all
it
does
not
require
a
search
it
is
all
very
well
to
rant
about
but
there
are
the
clear
hard
conditions
of
contemporary
circumstances
for
all
but
the
really
rich
and
so
patent
are
they
that
i
doubt
if
all
the
eloquence
of
roosevelt
and
its
myriad
echoes
has
added
a
thousand
babies
to
the
eugenic
wealth
of
the
world
modern
married
people
and
particularly
those
in
just
that
capable
middle
class
from
which
children
are
most
urgently
desirable
from
the
statesman
point
of
view
are
going
to
have
one
or
two
children
to
please
themselves
but
they
are
not
going
to
have
larger
families
under
existing
conditions
though
all
the
and
all
the
pulpits
in
the
world
clamour
together
for
them
to
do
so
if
having
and
rearing
children
is
a
private
affair
then
no
one
has
any
right
to
revile
small
families
if
it
is
a
public
service
then
the
parent
is
justified
in
looking
to
the
state
to
recognise
that
service
and
offer
some
compensation
for
the
worldly
disadvantages
it
entails
he
is
justified
in
saying
that
while
his
unencumbered
rival
wins
past
him
he
is
doing
the
state
the
most
precious
service
in
the
world
by
rearing
and
educating
a
family
and
that
the
state
has
become
his
debtor
in
other
words
the
modern
state
has
got
to
pay
for
its
children
if
it
really
wants
them
and
more
particularly
it
has
to
pay
for
the
children
of
good
homes
the
alternative
to
that
is
racial
replacement
and
social
decay
that
is
the
essential
idea
conveyed
by
this
phrase
the
endowment
of
motherhood
now
how
is
the
paying
to
be
done
that
needs
a
more
elaborate
answer
of
which
i
will
give
here
only
the
roughest
crudest
suggestion
probably
it
would
be
found
best
that
the
payment
should
be
made
to
the
mother
as
the
administrator
of
the
family
budget
that
its
amount
should
be
made
dependent
upon
the
quality
of
the
home
in
which
the
children
are
being
reared
upon
their
health
and
physical
development
and
upon
their
educational
success
be
it
remembered
we
do
not
want
any
children
we
want
children
the
amount
to
be
paid
i
would
particularly
point
out
should
vary
with
the
standing
of
the
home
people
of
that
excellent
class
which
spends
over
a
hundred
a
year
on
each
child
ought
to
get
about
that
much
from
the
state
and
people
of
the
class
which
spends
five
shillings
a
week
per
head
on
them
would
get
about
that
and
so
on
and
if
these
payments
were
met
by
a
special
income
tax
there
would
be
no
social
injustice
whatever
in
such
an
unequality
of
payment
each
social
stratum
would
pay
according
to
its
prosperity
and
the
only
redistribution
that
would
in
effect
occur
would
be
that
the
childless
people
of
each
class
would
pay
for
the
children
of
that
class
the
childless
family
and
the
small
family
would
pay
equally
with
the
large
family
incomes
being
equal
but
they
would
receive
in
proportions
varying
with
the
health
and
general
quality
of
their
children
that
i
think
gives
the
broad
principles
upon
which
the
payments
would
be
made
of
course
if
these
subsidies
resulted
in
too
rapid
a
rise
in
the
it
would
be
practicable
to
diminish
the
inducement
and
if
on
the
other
hand
the
still
fell
it
would
be
easy
to
increase
the
inducement
until
it
sufficed
that
concisely
is
the
idea
of
the
endowment
of
motherhood
i
believe
firmly
that
some
such
arrangement
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
continuous
development
of
the
modern
state
these
proposals
arise
so
obviously
out
of
the
needs
of
our
time
that
i
can
not
understand
any
really
intelligent
opposition
to
them
i
can
however
understand
a
partial
and
silly
application
of
them
it
is
most
important
that
our
families
should
be
endowed
but
the
whole
tendency
of
the
timid
and
disingenuous
progressivism
of
our
time
which
is
all
mixed
up
with
ideas
of
charity
and
aggressive
benevolence
to
the
poor
would
be
to
apply
this
as
that
fabian
tract
i
mention
does
only
to
the
poor
mother
to
endow
poor
and
motherhood
and
leave
other
people
severely
alone
would
be
a
proceeding
so
supremely
idiotic
so
harmful
to
our
national
quality
as
to
be
highly
probable
in
the
present
state
of
our
public
intelligence
it
comes
quite
on
a
level
with
the
policy
of
starving
education
that
has
left
us
with
nearly
the
worst
educated
middle
class
in
western
europe
the
endowment
of
motherhood
does
not
attract
the
bureaucratic
type
of
reformer
because
it
offers
a
minimum
chance
of
meddlesome
interference
with
people
lives
there
would
be
no
chance
of
seeking
out
anybody
and
applying
benevolent
but
grim
compulsions
on
the
strength
of
it
in
spite
of
its
wide
scope
it
would
be
much
less
of
a
public
nuisance
than
that
wet
children
charter
which
exasperates
me
every
time
i
pass
a
on
a
rainy
night
but
on
the
other
hand
there
would
be
an
enormous
stimulus
to
people
to
raise
the
quality
of
their
homes
study
infantile
hygiene
seek
out
good
schools
for
them
and
do
their
duty
as
all
good
parents
naturally
want
to
do
now
if
only
economic
forces
were
not
so
pitilessly
against
them
thoroughly
and
well
doctors
in
that
extravagant
world
of
which
i
dream
in
which
people
will
live
in
delightful
cottages
and
ground
rents
will
serve
instead
of
rates
and
everyone
will
have
a
chance
of
being
happy
in
that
impossible
world
all
doctors
will
be
members
of
one
great
organisation
for
the
public
health
with
all
or
most
of
their
income
guaranteed
to
them
i
doubt
if
there
will
be
any
private
doctors
at
all
heaven
forbid
i
should
seem
to
write
a
word
against
doctors
as
they
are
daily
i
marvel
at
the
wonders
the
general
practitioner
achieves
having
regard
to
the
difficulties
of
his
position
but
i
can
not
hide
from
myself
and
i
do
not
intend
to
hide
from
anyone
else
my
firm
persuasion
that
the
services
the
general
practitioner
is
able
to
render
us
are
not
so
effectual
as
they
might
be
if
instead
of
his
being
a
private
adventurer
he
were
a
member
of
a
sanely
organised
public
machine
consider
what
his
training
and
equipment
are
consider
the
peculiar
difficulties
of
his
work
and
then
consider
for
a
moment
what
better
conditions
might
be
invented
and
perhaps
you
will
not
think
my
estimate
of
an
excessive
understatement
in
this
matter
nearly
the
whole
of
our
medical
profession
and
most
of
our
apparatus
for
teaching
and
training
doctors
subsist
on
strictly
commercial
lines
by
earning
fees
this
chief
source
of
revenue
is
eked
out
by
the
wanton
charity
of
old
women
and
conspicuous
subscriptions
by
popularity
hunters
and
a
small
but
growing
contribution
in
the
salaries
of
medical
officers
of
health
and
so
forth
from
the
public
funds
but
the
fact
remains
that
for
the
great
mass
of
the
medical
profession
there
is
no
living
to
be
got
except
at
a
salary
for
hospital
practice
or
by
earning
fees
in
receiving
or
attending
upon
private
cases
so
long
as
a
doctor
is
learning
or
adding
to
knowledge
he
earns
nothing
and
the
common
unintelligent
man
does
not
see
why
he
should
earn
anything
so
that
a
doctor
who
has
no
religious
passion
for
poverty
and
gets
through
the
minimum
of
training
and
learning
as
quickly
and
as
cheaply
as
possible
and
does
all
he
can
to
fill
up
the
rest
of
his
time
in
passing
rapidly
from
case
to
case
the
busier
he
keeps
the
less
his
leisure
for
thought
and
learning
the
richer
he
grows
and
the
more
he
is
esteemed
his
four
or
five
years
of
hasty
crowded
study
are
supposed
to
give
him
a
complete
and
final
knowledge
of
the
treatment
of
every
sort
of
disease
and
he
goes
on
year
after
year
often
without
working
mechanically
in
the
common
incidents
of
practice
births
cases
of
measles
and
whooping
cough
and
so
forth
and
blundering
more
or
less
in
whatever
else
turns
up
there
are
no
public
specialists
to
whom
he
can
conveniently
refer
the
difficulties
he
constantly
encounters
only
in
the
case
of
rich
patients
is
the
specialist
available
there
are
no
properly
organised
information
bureaus
for
him
and
no
means
whatever
of
keeping
him
informed
upon
progress
and
discovery
in
medical
science
he
is
not
even
required
to
set
apart
a
month
or
so
in
every
two
or
three
years
in
order
to
return
to
lectures
and
hospitals
and
refresh
his
knowledge
indeed
the
income
of
the
average
general
practitioner
would
not
permit
of
such
a
thing
and
almost
the
only
means
of
contact
between
him
and
current
thought
lies
in
the
one
or
other
of
our
two
great
medical
weeklies
to
which
he
happens
to
subscribe
now
just
as
i
have
nothing
but
praise
for
the
average
general
practitioner
so
i
have
nothing
but
praise
and
admiration
for
those
publications
without
them
i
can
imagine
nothing
but
the
most
terrible
intellectual
atrophy
among
our
medical
men
but
since
they
are
private
properties
run
for
profit
they
have
to
pay
and
half
their
bulk
consists
of
the
brilliantly
written
advertisements
of
new
drugs
and
apparatus
they
give
much
knowledge
they
do
much
to
ventilate
perplexing
questions
but
a
broadly
conceived
and
properly
endowed
weekly
circular
could
i
believe
do
much
more
at
any
rate
in
my
utopia
this
duty
of
feeding
up
the
general
practitioners
will
not
be
left
to
private
enterprise
behind
the
first
line
of
my
medical
army
will
be
a
second
line
of
able
men
constantly
digesting
new
research
for
its
practical
needs
correcting
explaining
announcing
and
in
addition
a
force
of
public
specialists
to
whom
every
difficulty
in
diagnosis
will
be
at
once
referred
and
there
will
be
a
properly
organised
system
of
reliefs
that
will
allow
the
general
practitioner
and
his
right
hand
the
nurse
to
come
back
to
the
refreshment
of
study
before
his
knowledge
and
mind
have
got
rusty
but
then
my
utopia
is
a
socialistic
system
under
our
present
system
of
competitive
scramble
under
any
system
that
reduces
medical
practice
to
mere
nothing
of
this
sort
is
possible
then
in
my
utopia
for
every
medical
man
who
was
mainly
occupied
in
practice
i
would
have
another
who
was
mainly
occupied
in
or
about
research
people
hear
so
much
about
modern
research
that
they
do
not
realise
how
entirely
inadequate
it
is
in
amount
and
equipment
our
general
public
is
still
too
stupid
to
understand
the
need
and
value
of
sustained
investigations
in
any
branch
of
knowledge
at
all
in
spite
of
all
the
lessons
of
the
last
century
it
still
fails
to
realise
how
discovery
and
invention
enrich
the
community
and
how
paying
an
investment
is
the
public
employment
of
clever
people
to
think
and
experiment
for
the
benefit
of
all
it
still
expects
to
get
a
newton
or
a
joule
for
a
year
and
requires
him
to
conduct
his
researches
in
the
margin
of
time
left
over
when
he
has
got
through
his
annual
eighty
or
ninety
lectures
it
imagines
discoveries
are
a
sort
of
inspiration
that
comes
when
professors
are
running
to
catch
trains
it
seems
incapable
of
imagining
how
enormous
are
the
untried
possibilities
of
research
of
course
if
you
will
only
pay
a
handful
of
men
salaries
at
which
the
cook
of
any
large
london
hotel
would
turn
up
his
nose
you
can
not
expect
to
have
the
master
minds
of
the
world
at
your
service
and
save
for
a
few
independent
or
devoted
men
therefore
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
such
a
poor
little
dribble
of
medical
research
as
is
now
going
on
is
in
the
hands
of
persons
of
much
more
than
average
mental
equipment
how
can
it
be
one
hears
a
lot
of
the
rigorous
research
into
the
problem
of
cancer
that
is
now
going
on
does
the
reader
realise
that
all
the
men
in
the
whole
world
who
are
giving
any
considerable
proportion
of
their
time
to
this
cancer
research
would
pack
into
a
very
small
room
that
they
are
working
in
little
groups
without
any
properly
organised
system
of
intercommunication
and
that
half
of
them
are
earning
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
salary
of
a
bond
street
shopwalker
by
those
vastly
important
inquiries
not
one
cancer
case
in
twenty
thousand
is
being
properly
described
and
reported
and
yet
in
comparison
with
other
diseases
cancer
is
being
particularly
well
attended
to
the
general
complacency
with
the
progress
in
knowledge
we
have
made
and
are
making
is
ridiculously
unjustifiable
enormous
things
were
no
doubt
done
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
many
fields
of
knowledge
but
all
that
was
done
was
out
of
all
proportion
petty
in
comparison
with
what
might
have
been
done
i
suppose
the
whole
of
the
unprecedented
progress
in
material
knowledge
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
work
of
two
or
three
thousand
men
who
toiled
against
opposition
spite
and
endless
disadvantages
without
proper
means
of
intercommunication
and
with
wretched
facilities
for
experiment
such
discoveries
as
were
distinctively
medical
were
the
work
of
only
a
few
hundred
men
now
suppose
instead
of
that
scattered
band
of
workers
a
great
army
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
suppose
for
instance
the
community
had
kept
as
many
scientific
and
medical
investigators
as
it
has
bookmakers
and
racing
touts
and
men
about
town
should
we
not
know
a
thousand
times
as
much
as
we
do
about
disease
and
health
and
strength
and
power
but
these
are
utopian
questionings
the
sane
practical
man
shakes
his
head
smiles
pityingly
at
my
dreamy
impracticability
and
passes
them
by
an
age
of
specialisation
there
is
something
of
the
phonograph
in
all
of
us
but
in
the
sort
of
eminent
person
who
makes
public
speeches
about
education
and
reading
and
who
gives
away
prizes
and
opens
educational
institutions
there
seems
to
be
little
else
but
gramophone
these
people
always
say
the
same
things
and
say
them
in
the
same
note
and
why
should
they
do
that
if
they
are
really
individuals
there
is
i
can
not
but
suspect
in
the
mysterious
activities
that
underlie
life
some
trade
in
records
for
these
distinguished
gramophones
and
it
is
a
trade
conducted
upon
cheap
and
wholesale
lines
there
must
be
in
these
demiurgic
profundities
a
rapid
manufacture
of
innumerable
thousands
of
that
particular
speech
about
scrappy
reading
and
that
contrast
of
modern
with
serious
literature
that
babbles
about
in
the
provinces
so
incessantly
gramophones
thinly
disguised
as
bishops
gramophones
still
more
thinly
disguised
as
eminent
statesmen
gramophones
and
gramophones
have
brazened
it
at
us
time
after
time
and
will
continue
to
brazen
it
to
our
grandchildren
when
we
are
dead
and
all
our
poor
protests
forgotten
and
almost
equally
popular
in
their
shameless
mouths
is
the
speech
that
declares
this
present
age
to
be
an
age
of
specialisation
we
all
know
the
profound
droop
of
the
eminent
person
eyelids
as
he
produces
that
discovery
the
edifying
deductions
or
the
solemn
warnings
he
unfolds
from
this
proposition
and
all
the
dignified
inconclusive
rigmarole
of
that
cylinder
and
it
is
nonsense
from
beginning
to
end
this
is
most
distinctly
an
age
of
specialisation
there
has
hardly
been
an
age
in
the
whole
course
of
history
less
so
than
the
present
a
few
moments
of
reflection
will
suffice
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
beyond
any
precedent
an
age
of
change
change
in
the
appliances
of
life
in
the
average
length
of
life
in
the
general
temper
of
life
and
the
two
things
are
incompatible
it
is
only
under
fixed
conditions
that
you
can
have
men
specialising
they
specialise
extremely
for
example
under
such
conditions
as
one
had
in
hindustan
up
to
the
coming
of
the
present
generation
there
the
metal
worker
or
the
cloth
worker
the
wheelwright
or
the
druggist
of
yesterday
did
his
work
under
almost
exactly
the
same
conditions
as
his
predecessor
did
it
five
hundred
years
before
he
had
the
same
resources
the
same
tools
the
same
materials
he
made
the
same
objects
for
the
same
ends
within
the
narrow
limits
thus
set
him
he
carried
work
to
a
fine
perfection
his
hand
his
mental
character
were
subdued
to
his
medium
his
dress
and
bearing
even
were
distinctive
he
was
in
fact
a
highly
specialised
man
he
transmitted
his
difference
to
his
sons
caste
was
the
logical
expression
in
the
social
organisation
of
this
state
of
high
specialisation
and
indeed
what
else
is
caste
or
any
definite
class
distinctions
but
that
but
the
most
obvious
fact
of
the
present
time
is
the
disappearance
of
caste
and
the
fluctuating
uncertainty
of
all
class
distinctions
if
one
looks
into
the
conditions
of
industrial
employment
specialisation
will
be
found
to
linger
just
in
proportion
as
a
trade
has
remained
unaffected
by
inventions
and
innovation
the
building
trade
for
example
is
a
fairly
conservative
one
a
brick
wall
is
made
much
as
it
was
made
two
hundred
years
ago
and
the
bricklayer
is
in
consequence
a
highly
skilled
and
inadaptable
specialist
no
one
who
has
not
passed
through
a
long
and
tedious
training
can
lay
bricks
properly
and
it
needs
a
specialist
to
plough
a
field
with
horses
or
to
drive
a
cab
through
the
streets
of
london
thatchers
cobblers
and
hand
workers
are
all
specialised
to
a
degree
no
new
modern
calling
requires
with
machinery
skill
disappears
and
unspecialised
intelligence
comes
in
any
generally
intelligent
man
can
learn
in
a
day
or
two
to
drive
an
electric
tram
fix
up
an
electric
lighting
installation
or
guide
a
building
machine
or
a
steam
plough
he
must
be
of
course
much
more
generally
intelligent
than
the
average
bricklayer
but
he
needs
far
less
specialised
skill
to
repair
machinery
requires
of
course
a
special
sort
of
knowledge
but
not
a
special
sort
of
training
in
no
way
is
this
disappearance
of
specialisation
more
marked
than
in
military
and
naval
affairs
in
the
great
days
of
greece
and
rome
war
was
a
special
calling
requiring
a
special
type
of
man
in
the
middle
ages
war
had
an
elaborate
technique
in
which
the
footman
played
the
part
of
an
unskilled
labourer
and
even
within
a
period
of
a
hundred
years
it
took
a
long
period
of
training
and
discipline
before
the
common
discursive
man
could
be
converted
into
the
steady
soldier
even
traditions
work
powerfully
through
extravagance
of
uniform
and
through
survivals
of
that
mechanical
discipline
that
was
so
important
in
the
days
of
fighting
to
keep
the
soldier
something
other
than
a
man
for
all
the
lessons
of
the
boer
war
we
are
still
inclined
to
believe
that
the
soldier
has
to
be
something
severely
parallel
carrying
a
rifle
he
fires
under
orders
obedient
to
the
pitch
of
absolute
abnegation
of
his
private
intelligence
we
still
think
that
our
officers
have
like
some
very
elaborate
and
noble
sort
of
performing
animal
to
be
trained
they
learn
to
fight
with
certain
specified
arms
and
weapons
instead
of
developing
intelligence
enough
to
use
anything
that
comes
to
hand
but
indeed
when
a
really
great
european
war
does
come
and
lets
loose
bicycles
wireless
telegraphy
aeroplanes
new
projectiles
of
every
size
and
shape
and
a
multitude
of
ingenious
persons
upon
the
preposterously
vast
hosts
of
conscription
the
military
caste
will
be
missing
within
three
months
of
the
beginning
and
the
inventive
versatile
intelligent
man
will
have
come
to
his
own
and
what
is
true
of
a
military
caste
is
equally
true
of
a
special
governing
class
such
as
our
public
schools
maintain
the
misunderstanding
that
has
given
rise
to
this
proposition
that
this
is
an
age
of
specialisation
and
through
that
no
end
of
mischief
in
misdirected
technical
education
and
the
like
is
essentially
a
confusion
between
specialisation
and
the
division
of
labour
no
doubt
this
is
an
age
when
everything
makes
for
wider
and
wider
work
that
was
once
done
by
one
highly
specialised
man
the
making
of
a
watch
for
example
is
now
turned
out
wholesale
by
elaborate
machinery
or
effected
in
great
quantities
by
the
contributed
efforts
of
a
number
of
people
each
of
these
people
may
bring
a
highly
developed
intelligence
to
bear
for
a
time
upon
the
special
problem
in
hand
but
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
specialising
to
do
that
thing
this
is
typically
shown
in
scientific
research
the
problem
or
the
parts
of
problems
upon
which
the
inquiry
of
an
individual
man
is
concentrated
are
often
much
narrower
than
the
problems
that
occupied
faraday
or
dalton
and
yet
the
hard
and
fast
lines
that
once
divided
physicist
from
chemist
or
botanist
from
pathologist
have
long
since
gone
professor
farmer
the
botanist
investigates
cancer
and
the
ordinary
educated
man
familiar
though
he
is
with
their
general
results
would
find
it
hard
to
say
which
were
the
chemists
and
which
the
physicists
among
professors
dewar
and
ramsey
lord
rayleigh
and
curie
the
classification
of
sciences
that
was
such
a
solemn
business
to
our
grandfathers
is
now
merely
a
mental
obstruction
it
is
interesting
to
glance
for
a
moment
at
the
possible
source
of
this
mischievous
confusion
between
specialisation
and
the
division
of
labour
i
have
already
glanced
at
the
possibility
of
a
diabolical
world
manufacturing
gramophone
records
for
our
bishops
and
statesmen
and
suchlike
leaders
of
thought
but
if
we
dismiss
that
as
a
merely
elegant
trope
i
must
confess
i
think
it
is
the
influence
of
herbert
spencer
his
philosophy
is
pervaded
by
an
insistence
which
is
i
think
entirely
without
justification
that
the
universe
and
every
sort
of
thing
in
it
moves
from
the
simple
and
homogeneous
to
the
complex
and
heterogeneous
an
unwary
man
obsessed
with
that
idea
would
be
very
likely
to
assume
without
consideration
that
men
were
less
specialised
in
a
barbaric
state
of
society
than
they
are
i
think
i
have
given
reasons
for
believing
that
the
reverse
of
this
is
nearer
the
truth
is
there
a
people
of
all
the
great
personifications
that
have
dominated
the
mind
of
man
the
greatest
the
most
marvellous
the
most
impossible
and
the
most
incredible
is
surely
the
people
that
impalpable
monster
to
which
the
world
has
consecrated
its
political
institutions
for
the
last
hundred
years
it
is
doubtful
now
whether
this
stupendous
superstition
has
reached
its
grand
climacteric
and
there
can
be
little
or
no
dispute
that
it
is
destined
to
play
a
prominent
part
in
the
history
of
mankind
for
many
years
to
come
there
is
a
practical
as
well
as
a
philosophical
interest
therefore
in
a
note
or
so
upon
the
attributes
of
this
legendary
being
i
write
legendary
but
thereby
i
display
myself
a
sceptic
to
a
very
large
number
of
people
the
people
is
one
of
the
profoundest
realities
in
life
they
believe
what
exactly
do
they
believe
about
the
people
when
they
speak
of
the
people
they
certainly
mean
something
more
than
the
whole
mass
of
individuals
in
a
country
lumped
together
that
is
the
people
a
mere
varied
aggregation
of
persons
moved
by
no
common
motive
a
complex
interplay
the
people
as
the
believer
understands
the
word
is
something
more
mysterious
than
that
the
people
is
something
that
overrides
and
is
added
to
the
individualities
that
make
up
the
people
it
is
as
it
were
itself
an
individuality
of
a
higher
order
as
indeed
its
capital
p
displays
it
has
a
will
of
its
own
which
is
not
the
will
of
any
particular
person
in
it
it
has
a
power
of
purpose
and
judgment
of
a
superior
sort
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
underlying
reality
of
all
national
life
and
the
real
seat
of
all
public
religious
emotion
unfortunately
it
lacks
powers
of
expression
and
so
there
is
need
of
rulers
and
interpreters
if
they
express
it
well
in
law
and
fact
in
book
and
song
they
prosper
under
its
mysterious
approval
if
they
do
not
it
revolts
or
forgets
or
does
something
else
of
an
equally
annihilatory
sort
that
briefly
is
the
idea
of
the
people
my
modest
thesis
is
that
there
exists
nothing
of
the
sort
that
the
world
of
men
is
entirely
made
up
of
the
individuals
that
compose
it
and
that
the
collective
action
is
just
the
algebraic
sum
of
all
individual
actions
how
far
the
opposite
opinion
may
go
one
must
talk
to
intelligent
americans
or
read
the
contemporary
literature
of
the
first
french
revolution
to
understand
i
find
for
example
so
typical
a
young
american
as
the
late
frank
norris
roundly
asserting
that
it
is
the
people
to
whom
we
are
to
ascribe
the
triumphant
emergence
of
the
name
of
shakespeare
from
the
ruck
of
his
contemporaries
and
the
passage
in
which
this
assertion
is
made
is
fairly
representative
of
the
general
expression
of
this
sort
of
mysticism
one
must
keep
one
faith
in
the
people
the
plain
people
the
burgesses
the
grocers
else
of
all
men
the
artists
are
most
miserable
and
their
teachings
vain
let
us
admit
and
concede
that
this
belief
is
ever
so
sorely
tried
at
times
but
in
the
end
and
at
last
they
will
listen
to
the
true
note
and
discriminate
between
it
and
the
false
and
then
he
resorts
to
italics
to
emphasise
the
last
analysis
the
people
are
always
and
it
was
that
still
more
typical
american
abraham
lincoln
who
declared
his
equal
confidence
in
the
political
wisdom
of
this
collective
being
you
can
fool
all
the
people
some
of
the
time
and
some
of
the
people
all
the
time
but
you
can
not
fool
all
the
people
all
the
time
the
thing
is
in
the
very
opening
words
of
the
american
constitution
and
theodore
parker
calls
it
the
american
idea
and
pitches
a
still
higher
note
a
government
of
all
the
people
by
all
the
people
for
all
the
people
a
government
of
all
the
principles
of
eternal
justice
unchanging
law
of
god
it
is
unavoidable
that
a
collective
wisdom
distinct
from
any
individual
and
personal
one
is
intended
in
these
passages
norris
for
example
never
figured
to
himself
a
great
wave
of
critical
discrimination
sweeping
through
the
ranks
of
the
various
provision
trades
and
a
multitude
of
simple
plain
burgesses
preferring
shakespeare
and
setting
marlowe
aside
such
a
particularisation
of
his
statement
would
have
at
once
reduced
it
to
absurdity
nor
does
any
american
see
the
people
particularised
in
that
way
they
believe
in
the
people
one
and
indivisible
a
simple
mystical
being
which
pervades
and
dominates
the
community
and
determines
its
final
collective
consequences
now
upon
the
belief
that
there
is
a
people
rests
a
large
part
of
the
political
organisation
of
the
modern
world
the
idea
was
one
of
the
chief
fruits
of
the
speculations
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
american
constitution
is
its
most
perfect
expression
one
turns
therefore
inevitably
to
the
american
instance
not
because
it
is
the
only
one
but
because
there
is
the
thing
in
its
least
complicated
form
we
have
there
an
almost
exactly
logical
realisation
of
this
belief
the
whole
political
machine
is
designed
and
expressed
to
register
the
people
will
literature
is
entirely
rewarded
and
controlled
by
the
effectual
suffrages
of
the
bookseller
counter
science
until
private
endowment
intervened
was
in
the
hands
of
the
state
legislatures
and
religion
the
concern
of
the
voluntary
congregations
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
people
there
could
be
no
better
state
of
affairs
you
and
i
and
everyone
except
for
a
vote
or
a
book
or
a
service
now
and
then
can
go
about
our
business
you
to
your
grocery
and
i
to
mine
and
the
direction
of
the
general
interests
rests
safe
in
the
people
hands
now
that
is
by
no
means
a
caricature
of
the
attitude
of
mind
of
many
educated
americans
you
find
they
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
actual
politics
and
are
inclined
to
regard
the
professional
politician
with
a
certain
contempt
they
trouble
their
heads
hardly
at
all
about
literature
and
they
contemplate
the
general
religious
condition
of
the
population
with
absolute
unconcern
it
is
not
that
they
are
unpatriotic
or
morally
trivial
that
they
stand
thus
disengaged
it
is
that
they
have
a
fatalistic
belief
in
this
higher
power
whatever
troubles
and
abuses
may
arise
they
have
an
absolute
faith
that
in
the
last
analysis
the
people
will
get
it
right
and
now
suppose
that
i
am
right
and
that
there
is
no
people
suppose
that
the
crowd
is
really
no
more
than
a
crowd
a
vast
miscellaneous
confusion
of
persons
which
grows
more
miscellaneous
every
year
suppose
this
conception
of
the
people
arose
out
of
a
sentimental
idealisation
rousseau
fashion
of
the
ancient
homogeneous
peasant
class
a
class
that
is
rapidly
being
swept
out
of
existence
by
modern
industrial
developments
and
that
whatever
slender
basis
of
fact
it
had
in
the
past
is
now
altogether
gone
what
consequences
may
be
expected
it
does
not
follow
that
because
the
object
of
your
reverence
is
a
dead
word
you
will
get
no
oracles
from
the
shrine
if
the
sacred
people
remains
impassive
inarticulate
there
are
always
the
keepers
of
the
shrine
who
will
oblige
professional
politicians
venal
and
violent
men
will
take
over
the
derelict
political
control
people
who
live
by
the
book
trade
will
alone
have
a
care
for
letters
research
and
learning
will
be
subordinated
to
political
expediency
and
a
great
development
of
noisily
competitive
religious
enterprises
will
take
the
place
of
any
common
religious
formula
there
will
commence
a
secular
decline
in
the
quality
of
public
thought
emotion
and
activity
there
will
be
no
arrest
or
remedy
for
this
state
of
affairs
so
long
as
that
superstitious
faith
in
the
people
as
inevitably
right
in
the
last
analysis
remains
and
if
my
supposition
is
correct
it
should
be
possible
to
find
in
the
united
states
where
faith
in
the
people
is
indisputably
dominant
some
such
evidence
of
the
error
of
this
faith
is
there
i
write
as
one
that
listens
from
afar
but
there
come
reports
of
legislative
and
administrative
corruption
of
organised
public
blackmail
that
do
seem
to
carry
out
my
thesis
one
thinks
of
edgar
allan
poe
who
dreamt
of
founding
a
distinctive
american
literature
drugged
and
killed
almost
as
it
were
symbolically
amid
electioneering
and
nearly
lied
out
of
all
posthumous
respect
by
that
scoundrel
griswold
one
thinks
of
state
universities
that
are
no
more
than
mints
for
bogus
degrees
one
thinks
of
science
christianity
and
zion
city
these
things
are
quite
insufficient
for
a
but
i
submit
they
favour
my
proposition
suppose
there
is
no
people
at
all
but
only
enormous
differentiating
millions
of
men
all
sorts
of
widely
accepted
generalisations
will
collapse
if
that
foundation
is
withdrawn
i
submit
it
as
worth
considering
the
disease
of
parliaments
sec
there
is
a
growing
discord
between
governments
and
governed
in
the
world
there
has
always
been
discord
between
governments
and
governed
since
states
began
government
has
always
been
to
some
extent
imposed
and
obedience
to
some
extent
reluctant
we
have
come
to
regard
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
under
all
absolutions
and
narrow
oligarchies
the
community
so
soon
as
it
became
educated
and
as
its
social
elaboration
developed
a
free
class
with
private
initiatives
so
soon
indeed
as
it
attained
to
any
power
of
thought
and
expression
at
all
would
express
discontent
but
we
english
and
americans
and
western
europeans
generally
had
supposed
that
so
far
as
our
own
communities
were
concerned
this
discontent
was
already
anticipated
and
met
by
representative
institutions
we
had
supposed
that
with
various
safeguards
and
elaborations
our
communities
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
govern
themselves
our
panacea
for
all
discontents
was
the
franchise
social
and
national
dissatisfaction
could
be
given
at
the
same
time
a
voice
and
a
remedy
in
the
ballot
box
our
liberal
intelligences
could
and
do
still
understand
russians
wanting
votes
indians
wanting
votes
women
wanting
votes
the
history
of
liberalism
in
the
world
might
almost
be
summed
up
in
the
phrase
progressive
enfranchisement
but
these
are
the
desires
of
a
closing
phase
in
political
history
the
new
discords
go
deeper
than
that
the
new
situation
which
confronts
our
liberal
intelligence
is
the
discontent
of
the
enfranchised
the
contempt
and
hostility
of
the
voters
for
their
elected
delegates
and
governments
this
discontent
this
resentment
this
contempt
even
and
hostility
to
duly
elected
representatives
is
no
mere
accident
of
this
democratic
country
or
that
it
is
an
almost
movement
it
is
an
almost
universal
disappointment
with
popular
government
and
in
many
communities
in
great
britain
particularly
it
is
manifesting
itself
by
an
unprecedented
lawlessness
in
political
matters
and
in
a
strange
and
ominous
contempt
for
the
law
one
sees
it
for
example
in
the
refusal
of
large
sections
of
the
medical
profession
to
carry
out
insurance
legislation
in
the
repudiation
of
irish
home
rule
by
ulster
and
in
the
steady
drift
of
great
masses
of
industrial
workers
towards
the
conception
of
a
universal
strike
the
case
of
the
discontented
workers
in
great
britain
and
france
is
particularly
remarkable
these
people
form
effective
voting
majorities
in
many
constituencies
they
send
alleged
socialist
and
labour
representatives
into
the
legislative
assembly
and
in
addition
they
have
their
trade
unions
with
staffs
of
elected
officials
elected
ostensibly
to
state
their
case
and
promote
their
interests
yet
nothing
is
now
more
evident
than
that
these
officials
representatives
and
the
like
do
not
speak
for
their
supporters
and
are
less
and
less
able
to
control
them
the
syndicalist
movement
sabotage
in
france
and
larkinism
in
great
britain
are
from
the
point
of
view
of
social
stability
the
most
sinister
demonstrations
of
the
gathering
anger
of
the
labouring
classes
with
representative
institutions
these
movements
are
not
revolutionary
movements
not
movements
for
reconstruction
such
as
were
the
democratic
socialist
movements
that
closed
the
nineteenth
century
they
are
angry
and
vindictive
movements
they
have
behind
them
the
most
dangerous
and
terrible
of
purely
human
forces
the
wrath
the
blind
destructive
wrath
of
a
cheated
crowd
now
so
far
as
the
insurrection
of
labour
goes
american
conditions
differ
from
european
and
the
process
of
disillusionment
will
probably
follow
a
different
course
american
labour
is
very
largely
immigrant
labour
still
separated
by
barriers
of
language
and
tradition
from
the
established
thought
of
the
nation
it
will
be
long
before
labour
in
america
speaks
with
the
massed
effectiveness
of
labour
in
france
and
england
where
master
and
man
are
racially
identical
and
where
there
is
no
variety
of
dagoes
to
break
up
the
revolt
but
in
other
directions
the
american
disbelief
in
and
impatience
with
elected
persons
is
and
has
been
far
profounder
than
it
is
in
europe
the
abstinence
of
men
of
property
and
position
from
overt
politics
and
the
contempt
that
banishes
political
discussion
from
polite
society
are
among
the
first
surprises
of
the
visiting
european
to
america
and
now
that
under
an
organised
pressure
of
conscience
men
and
men
of
wealth
are
abandoning
this
strike
of
the
educated
and
returning
to
political
life
it
is
one
notes
with
a
prevailing
disposition
to
correct
democracy
by
personality
and
to
place
affairs
in
the
hands
of
autocratic
mayors
and
presidents
rather
than
to
carry
out
democratic
methods
to
the
logical
end
at
times
america
seems
hot
for
a
caesar
if
no
caesar
is
established
then
it
will
be
the
good
fortune
of
the
republic
rather
than
its
democratic
virtue
which
will
have
saved
it
and
directly
one
comes
to
look
into
the
quality
and
composition
of
the
elected
governing
body
of
any
modern
democratic
state
one
begins
to
see
the
reason
and
nature
of
its
widening
estrangement
from
the
community
it
represents
in
no
sense
are
these
bodies
really
representative
of
the
thought
and
purpose
of
the
nation
the
conception
of
its
science
the
fresh
initiatives
of
its
philosophy
and
literature
the
forces
that
make
the
future
through
invention
and
experiment
exploration
and
trial
and
industrial
development
have
no
voice
or
only
an
accidental
and
feeble
voice
there
the
typical
elected
person
is
a
smart
rather
than
substantial
lawyer
full
of
cheap
catchwords
and
elaborate
tricks
of
procedure
and
electioneering
professing
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
locality
which
is
his
constituency
but
actually
bound
hand
and
foot
to
the
specialised
political
association
his
party
which
imposed
him
upon
that
constituency
arrived
at
the
legislature
his
next
ambition
is
office
and
to
secure
and
retain
office
he
engages
in
elaborate
manoeuvres
against
the
opposite
party
upon
issues
which
his
limited
and
specialised
intelligence
indicates
as
electorally
effective
but
being
limited
and
specialised
he
is
apt
to
drift
completely
out
of
touch
with
the
interests
and
feelings
of
large
masses
of
people
in
the
community
in
great
britain
the
united
states
and
france
alike
there
is
a
constant
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
legislative
body
to
drift
into
unreality
and
to
bore
the
country
with
the
disputes
that
are
designed
to
thrill
it
in
great
britain
for
example
at
the
present
time
the
two
political
parties
are
both
profoundly
unpopular
with
the
general
intelligence
which
is
sincerely
anxious
if
only
it
could
find
a
way
to
get
rid
of
both
of
them
irish
home
rule
an
issue
as
dead
as
mutton
is
opposed
to
tariff
reform
which
has
never
been
alive
much
as
the
majority
of
people
detest
the
preposterously
clumsy
attempts
to
amputate
ireland
from
the
rule
of
the
british
parliament
which
have
been
going
on
since
the
breakdown
of
gladstone
political
intelligence
their
dread
of
foolish
and
scoundrelly
fiscal
adventurers
is
sufficiently
strong
to
retain
the
liberals
in
office
the
recent
exposures
of
the
profound
financial
rottenness
of
the
liberal
party
have
deepened
the
public
resolve
to
permit
no
such
enlarged
possibilities
of
corruption
as
tariff
reform
would
afford
their
at
least
equally
dubitable
opponents
and
meanwhile
beneath
those
ridiculous
alternatives
those
sham
issues
the
real
and
very
urgent
affairs
of
the
nation
the
vast
gathering
discontent
of
the
workers
throughout
the
empire
the
racial
conflicts
in
india
and
south
africa
which
will
if
they
are
not
arrested
end
in
our
severance
from
india
the
insane
waste
of
national
resources
the
control
of
disease
the
frightful
need
of
some
cessation
of
armament
drift
neglected
now
do
these
things
indicate
the
ultimate
failure
and
downfall
of
representative
government
was
this
idea
which
inspired
so
much
of
the
finest
and
most
generous
thought
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
a
wrong
idea
and
must
we
go
back
to
caesarism
or
oligarchy
or
plutocracy
or
a
theocracy
to
rome
or
venice
or
carthage
to
the
strong
man
or
the
ruler
by
divine
right
for
the
political
organisation
of
the
future
my
answer
to
that
question
would
be
an
emphatic
no
my
answer
would
be
that
the
idea
of
representative
government
is
the
only
possible
idea
for
the
government
of
a
civilised
community
but
i
would
add
that
so
far
representative
government
has
not
had
even
the
beginnings
of
a
fair
trial
so
far
we
have
not
had
representative
government
but
only
a
devastating
caricature
it
is
quite
plain
now
that
those
who
first
organised
the
parliamentary
institutions
which
now
are
the
ruling
institutions
of
the
greater
part
of
mankind
fell
a
prey
to
certain
now
very
obvious
errors
they
did
not
realise
that
there
are
hundreds
of
different
ways
in
which
voting
may
be
done
and
that
every
way
will
give
a
different
result
they
thought
and
it
is
still
thought
by
a
great
number
of
mentally
indolent
people
that
if
a
country
is
divided
up
into
approximately
equivalent
areas
each
returning
one
or
two
representatives
if
every
citizen
is
given
one
vote
and
if
there
is
no
legal
limit
to
the
presentation
of
candidates
that
presently
a
cluster
of
the
wisest
most
trusted
and
best
citizens
will
come
together
in
the
legislative
assembly
in
reality
the
business
is
far
more
complicated
than
this
in
reality
a
country
will
elect
all
sorts
of
different
people
according
to
the
electoral
method
employed
it
is
a
fact
that
anyone
who
chooses
to
experiment
with
a
willing
school
or
club
may
verify
suppose
for
example
that
you
take
your
country
give
every
voter
one
single
vote
put
up
six
and
twenty
candidates
for
a
dozen
vacancies
and
give
them
no
adequate
time
for
organisation
the
voters
you
will
find
will
return
certain
favourites
a
and
b
and
c
and
d
let
us
call
them
by
enormous
majorities
and
behind
these
at
a
considerable
distance
will
come
e
f
g
h
i
j
k
and
now
give
your
candidates
time
to
develop
organisation
a
lot
of
people
who
swelled
a
huge
vote
will
dislike
j
and
k
and
l
so
much
and
prefer
m
and
n
so
much
that
if
they
are
assured
that
by
proper
organisation
a
return
can
be
made
certain
without
their
voting
for
him
they
will
vote
for
m
and
but
they
will
do
so
only
on
that
understanding
similarly
certain
will
want
o
and
p
if
they
can
be
got
without
sacrificing
b
so
that
adequate
party
organisation
in
the
community
may
return
not
the
dozen
a
naive
vote
would
give
but
a
b
c
d
e
f
g
h
m
n
o
now
suppose
that
instead
of
this
arrangement
your
community
is
divided
into
twelve
constituencies
and
no
candidate
may
contest
more
than
one
of
them
and
suppose
each
constituency
has
strong
local
preferences
a
b
and
c
are
widely
popular
in
every
constituency
they
have
supporters
but
in
no
constituency
does
any
one
of
the
three
command
a
majority
they
are
great
men
not
local
men
q
who
is
an
unknown
man
in
most
of
the
country
has
on
the
contrary
a
strong
sect
of
followers
in
the
constituency
for
which
a
stands
and
beats
him
by
one
vote
another
local
celebrity
e
disposes
of
b
in
the
same
way
c
is
attacked
not
only
by
s
but
t
whose
peculiar
views
upon
vaccination
let
us
say
appeal
to
just
enough
of
c
supporters
to
let
in
similar
accidents
happen
in
the
other
constituencies
and
the
country
that
would
have
unreservedly
returned
a
b
c
d
e
f
g
h
i
j
k
and
l
on
the
first
system
return
instead
o
p
q
r
s
t
u
v
w
x
y
z
numerous
voters
who
would
have
voted
for
a
if
they
had
a
chance
vote
instead
for
r
s
t
numbers
who
would
have
voted
for
b
vote
for
q
v
w
x
etc
but
now
suppose
that
a
and
b
are
opposed
to
one
another
and
that
there
is
a
strong
a
party
and
a
strong
b
party
highly
organised
in
the
country
b
is
really
the
second
favourite
over
the
country
as
a
whole
but
a
is
the
first
favourite
d
f
h
j
l

the

and
in
his
name
they
conquer

are
all
thrown
out
in
spite
of
the
wide
popularity
of
b
and

and
c
we
have
supposed
are
the
second
and
third
favourites
and
yet
they
go
out
in
favour
of
y
of
whom
nobody
has
heard
before
some
mere
of
a
such
a
situation
actually
occurs
in
both
ulster
and
ireland
but
now
let
us
suppose
another
arrangement
and
that
is
that
the
whole
country
is
one
constituency
and
every
voter
has
if
he
chooses
to
exercise
them
twelve
votes
which
however
he
must
give
if
he
gives
them
all
to
twelve
separate
people
then
quite
certainly
a
b
c
d
will
come
in
but
the
tail
will
be
different
m
n
o
p
may
come
up
next
to
them
and
even
z
that
eminent
man
may
get
in
but
now
organisation
may
produce
new
effects
the
ordinary
man
when
he
has
twelve
votes
to
give
likes
to
give
them
all
so
that
there
will
be
a
good
deal
of
wild
voting
at
the
tails
of
the
voting
papers
now
if
a
small
resolute
band
decide
to
plump
for
t
or
to
vote
only
for
a
and
t
or
b
and
t
t
will
probably
jump
up
out
of
the
rejected
this
is
the
system
which
gives
the
specialist
the
or
what
not
the
maximum
advantage
v
w
x
and
y
being
rather
hopeless
anyhow
will
probably
detach
themselves
from
party
and
make
some
special
appeal
say
to
the
teetotal
vote
or
the
mormon
vote
or
the
single
tax
vote
and
so
squeeze
past
o
p
q
r
who
have
taken
a
more
generalised
line
i
trust
the
reader
will
bear
with
me
through
these
alphabetical
fluctuations
many
people
i
know
from
colloquial
experiences
do
at
about
this
stage
fly
into
a
passion
but
if
you
will
exercise
then
i
think
you
will
see
my
point
that
according
to
the
method
of
voting
almost
any
sort
of
result
may
be
got
out
of
an
election
except
the
production
of
a
genuinely
representative
assembly
and
that
is
the
a
priori
case
for
supposing
what
our
experience
of
contemporary
life
abundantly
verifies
that
the
representative
assemblies
of
the
world
are
not
really
representative
at
all
i
will
go
farther
and
say
that
were
it
not
for
the
entire
inefficiency
of
our
method
of
voting
not
of
the
present
american
and
french
senators
the
french
deputies
the
american
congressmen
and
the
english
members
of
parliament
would
hold
their
positions
they
would
never
have
been
heard
of
they
are
not
really
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
they
are
the
products
of
a
ridiculous
method
of
election
they
are
the
illegitimate
children
of
the
party
system
and
the
who
have
ousted
the
legitimate
heirs
from
their
sovereignty
they
are
no
more
the
expression
of
the
general
will
than
the
tsar
or
some
president
by
they
are
an
accidental
oligarchy
of
adventurers
representative
government
has
never
yet
existed
in
the
world
there
was
an
attempt
to
bring
it
into
existence
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
it
succumbed
to
an
infantile
disorder
at
the
very
moment
of
its
birth
what
we
have
in
the
place
of
the
leaders
and
representatives
are
politicians
and
elected
persons
the
world
is
passing
rapidly
from
localised
to
generalised
interests
but
the
method
of
election
into
which
our
fathers
fell
is
the
method
of
electing
one
or
two
representatives
from
strictly
localised
constituencies
its
immediate
corruption
was
inevitable
if
discussing
and
calculating
the
future
had
been
as
it
ought
to
be
a
common
systematic
occupation
the
muddles
of
might
have
been
foretold
a
hundred
years
ago
from
such
a
rough
method
of
election
the
party
system
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
in
theory
of
course
there
may
be
any
number
of
candidates
for
a
constituency
and
a
voter
votes
for
the
one
he
likes
best
in
practice
there
are
only
two
or
three
candidates
and
the
voter
votes
for
the
one
most
likely
to
beat
the
candidate
he
likes
least
it
can
not
be
too
strongly
insisted
that
in
contemporary
elections
we
vote
against
we
do
not
vote
for
if
a
b
and
c
are
candidates
and
you
hate
c
and
all
his
works
and
prefer
a
but
doubt
if
he
will
get
as
many
votes
as
b
who
is
indifferent
to
you
the
chances
are
you
will
vote
for

if
c
and
b
have
the
support
of
organised
parties
you
are
still
less
likely
to
risk
wasting
your
vote
upon
a
if
your
real
confidence
is
in

who
is
not
a
candidate
for
your
constituency
and
if
b
pledges
himself
to
support
g
while
a
retains
the
right
of
separate
action
you
may
vote
for
b
even
if
you
distrust
him
personally
additional
candidates
would
turn
any
election
of
this
type
into
a
wild
scramble
the
system
lies
in
fact
wholly
open
to
the
control
of
political
organisations
calls
out
indeed
for
the
control
of
political
organisations
and
has
in
every
country
produced
what
is
so
evidently
demanded
the
political
organisations
rule
us
unchallenged
save
as
they
speak
for
us
the
people
are
dumb
elections
of
the
prevalent
pattern
which
were
intended
and
are
still
supposed
by
people
to
give
every
voter
participation
in
government
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
effect
nothing
of
the
sort
they
give
him
an
exasperating
fragment
of
choice
between
the
agents
of
two
party
organisations
over
neither
of
which
he
has
any
intelligible
control
for
years
i
have
been
a
voter
and
in
all
that
time
i
have
only
twice
had
an
opportunity
of
voting
for
a
man
of
distinction
in
whom
i
had
the
slightest
confidence
commonly
my
choice
of
a
representative
has
been
between
a
couple
of
barristers
entirely
unknown
to
me
or
the
world
at
large
rather
more
than
half
the
men
presented
for
my
selection
have
not
been
english
at
all
but
of
alien
descent
this
then
is
the
sum
of
the
political
liberty
of
the
ordinary
american
or
englishman
that
is
the
political
emancipation
which
englishwomen
have
shown
themselves
so
pathetically
eager
to
share
he
may
reject
one
of
two
undesirables
and
the
other
becomes
his
representative
now
this
is
not
popular
government
at
all
it
is
government
by
the
profession
of
politicians
whose
control
becomes
more
and
more
irresponsible
in
just
the
measure
that
they
are
able
to
avoid
real
factions
within
their
own
body
whatever
the
two
party
organisations
have
a
mind
to
do
together
whatever
issue
they
chance
to
reserve
from
party
politics
is
as
much
beyond
the
control
of
the
free
and
independent
voter
as
if
he
were
a
slave
subject
in
ancient
peru
our
governments
in
the
more
civilised
parts
of
the
world
are
only
in
theory
and
sentiment
democratic
in
reality
they
are
democracies
so
eviscerated
by
the
disease
of
bad
electoral
methods
that
they
are
mere
cloaks
for
the
parasitic
oligarchies
that
have
grown
up
within
their
form
and
substance
the
old
spirit
of
freedom
and
the
collective
purpose
which
overthrew
and
subdued
priestcrafts
and
kingcrafts
has
done
so
it
seems
only
to
make
way
for
these
obscure
political
conspiracies
instead
of
liberal
institutions
mankind
has
invented
a
new
sort
of
usurpation
and
it
is
not
unnatural
that
many
of
us
should
be
in
a
phase
of
political
despair
these
oligarchies
of
the
party
organisations
have
now
been
evolving
for
two
centuries
and
their
inherent
evils
and
dangers
become
more
and
more
manifest
the
first
of
these
is
the
exclusion
from
government
of
the
more
active
and
intelligent
sections
of
the
community
it
is
not
treated
as
remarkable
it
is
treated
as
a
matter
of
course
that
neither
in
congress
nor
in
the
house
of
commons
is
there
any
adequate
representation
of
the
real
thought
of
the
time
of
its
science
invention
and
enterprise
of
its
art
and
feeling
of
its
religion
and
purpose
when
one
speaks
of
congressmen
or
members
of
parliament
one
thinks
to
be
plain
about
it
of
intellectual
when
one
hears
of
a
man
in
the
community
even
though
that
may
be
in
political
or
social
science
one
is
struck
by
a
sense
of
incongruity
if
he
happens
to
be
also
in
the
legislature
when
lord
haldane
disengages
the
gifford
lectures
or
lord
morley
writes
a
life
of
gladstone
or
roosevelt
is
delivered
of
a
magazine
article
there
is
the
same
sort
of
excessive
admiration
as
when
a
royal
princess
does
a
sketch
or
a
dog
walks
on
its
hind
legs
now
this
intellectual
inferiority
of
the
legislator
is
not
only
directly
bad
for
the
community
by
producing
dull
and
stupid
legislation
but
it
has
a
discouraging
and
dwarfing
effect
upon
our
intellectual
life
nothing
so
stimulates
art
thought
and
science
as
realisation
nothing
so
cripples
it
as
unreality
but
to
set
oneself
to
know
thoroughly
and
to
think
clearly
about
any
human
question
is
to
unfit
oneself
for
the
forensic
claptrap
which
is
contemporary
politics
is
to
put
oneself
out
of
the
effective
current
of
the
nation
life
the
intelligence
of
any
community
which
does
not
make
a
collective
use
of
that
intelligence
starves
and
becomes
hectic
tends
inevitably
to
preciousness
and
futility
on
the
one
hand
and
to
insurgency
mischief
and
anarchism
on
the
other
from
the
point
of
view
of
social
stability
this
estrangement
of
the
national
government
and
the
national
intelligence
is
far
less
serious
than
the
estrangement
between
the
governing
body
and
the
real
feeling
of
the
mass
of
the
people
to
many
observers
this
latter
estrangement
seems
to
be
drifting
very
rapidly
towards
a
social
explosion
in
the
british
isles
the
organised
masses
of
labour
find
themselves
baffled
both
by
their
parliamentary
representatives
and
by
their
trade
union
officials
they
are
losing
faith
in
their
votes
and
falling
back
in
anger
upon
insurrectionary
ideals
upon
the
idea
of
a
general
strike
and
upon
the
expedients
of
sabotage
they
are
doing
this
without
any
constructive
proposals
at
all
for
it
is
ridiculous
to
consider
syndicalism
as
a
constructive
proposal
they
mean
mischief
because
they
are
hopeless
and
bitterly
disappointed
it
is
the
same
thing
in
france
and
before
many
years
are
over
it
will
be
the
same
thing
in
america
that
way
lies
chaos
in
the
next
few
years
there
may
be
social
revolt
and
bloodshed
in
most
of
the
great
cities
of
western
europe
that
is
the
trend
of
current
probability
yet
the
politicians
go
on
in
an
almost
complete
disregard
of
this
gathering
storm
their
jerrymandered
electoral
methods
are
like
wool
in
their
ears
and
the
rejection
of
tweedledum
for
tweedledee
is
taken
as
a
mandate
for
tweedledee
distinctive
brand
of
political
unrealities
is
this
an
incurable
state
of
things
is
this
method
of
managing
our
affairs
the
only
possible
electoral
method
and
is
there
no
remedy
for
its
monstrous
clumsiness
and
inefficiency
but
to
show
a
sense
of
humour
or
in
other
words
to
grin
and
bear
it
or
is
it
conceivable
that
there
may
be
a
better
way
to
government
than
any
we
have
yet
tried
a
method
of
government
that
would
draw
every
class
into
conscious
and
willing
with
the
state
and
enable
every
activity
of
the
community
to
play
its
proper
part
in
the
national
life
that
was
the
dream
of
those
who
gave
the
world
representative
government
in
the
past
was
it
an
impossible
dream
sec
is
this
disease
of
parliaments
an
incurable
disease
and
have
we
therefore
to
get
along
as
well
as
we
can
with
it
just
as
a
tainted
and
incurable
invalid
diets
and
is
careful
and
gets
along
through
life
or
is
it
possible
that
some
entirely
more
representative
and
effective
collective
control
of
our
common
affairs
can
be
devised
the
answer
to
that
must
determine
our
attitude
to
a
great
number
of
fundamental
questions
if
no
better
governing
body
is
possible
than
the
stupid
dilatory
and
forensic
assemblies
that
rule
in
france
britain
and
america
then
the
civilised
human
community
has
reached
its
climax
that
more
comprehensive
collective
handling
of
the
common
interests
to
which
science
and
intelligent
socialism
point
that
collective
handling
which
is
already
urgently
needed
if
the
present
uncontrolled
waste
of
natural
resources
and
the
ultimate
bankruptcy
of
mankind
is
to
be
avoided
is
quite
beyond
the
capacity
of
such
assemblies
already
there
is
too
much
in
their
clumsy
and
untrustworthy
hands
and
the
only
course
open
to
us
is
an
attempt
at
enlightened
individualism
an
attempt
to
limit
and
restrict
state
activities
in
every
possible
way
and
to
make
little
private
temporary
islands
of
light
and
refinement
amidst
the
general
disorder
and
decay
all
collectivist
schemes
all
rational
socialism
if
only
socialists
would
realise
it
all
hope
for
humanity
indeed
are
dependent
ultimately
upon
the
hypothetical
possibility
of
a
better
system
of
government
than
any
at
present
in
existence
let
us
see
first
then
if
we
can
lay
down
any
conditions
which
such
a
better
governing
body
would
satisfy
afterwards
it
will
be
open
to
us
to
believe
or
disbelieve
in
its
attainment
imagination
is
the
essence
of
creation
if
we
can
imagine
a
better
government
we
are
to
making
it
now
whatever
other
conditions
such
a
body
will
satisfy
we
may
be
sure
that
it
will
not
be
made
up
of
members
elected
by
constituencies
a
constituency
must
necessarily
contain
a
minority
and
may
even
contain
a
majority
of
dissatisfied
persons
whose
representation
is
as
it
were
blotted
out
by
the
successful
candidate
three
constituencies
which
might
all
return
members
of
the
same
colour
if
they
were
lumped
together
to
return
three
members
would
probably
return
two
of
one
colour
and
one
of
another
there
would
still
however
be
a
suppressed
minority
averse
to
both
these
colours
or
desiring
different
shades
of
those
colours
from
those
afforded
them
in
the
constituency
other
things
being
equal
it
may
be
laid
down
that
the
larger
the
constituency
and
the
more
numerous
its
representatives
the
greater
the
chance
of
all
varieties
of
thought
and
opinion
being
represented
but
that
is
only
a
preliminary
statement
it
still
leaves
untouched
all
the
considerations
advanced
in
the
former
part
of
this
discussion
to
show
how
easily
the
complications
and
difficulties
of
voting
lead
to
a
falsification
of
the
popular
will
and
understanding
but
here
we
enter
a
region
where
a
really
scientific
investigation
has
been
made
and
where
established
results
are
available
a
method
of
election
was
worked
out
by
hare
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
that
really
does
seem
to
avoid
or
mitigate
nearly
every
falsifying
or
debilitating
possibility
in
elections
it
was
enthusiastically
supported
by
mill
it
is
now
advocated
by
a
special
society
the
proportional
representation
society
to
which
belong
men
of
the
most
diverse
type
of
distinction
united
only
by
the
common
desire
to
see
representative
government
a
reality
and
not
a
disastrous
sham
it
is
a
method
which
does
render
impossible
nearly
every
way
of
forcing
candidates
upon
constituencies
and
nearly
every
trick
for
rigging
results
that
now
distorts
and
cripples
the
political
life
of
the
modern
world
it
exacts
only
one
condition
a
difficult
but
not
an
impossible
condition
and
that
is
the
honest
scrutiny
and
counting
of
the
votes
the
peculiar
invention
of
the
system
is
what
is
called
the
single
transferable
vote
that
is
to
say
a
vote
which
may
be
given
in
the
first
instance
to
one
candidate
but
which
in
the
event
of
his
already
having
a
sufficient
quota
of
votes
to
return
him
may
be
transferred
to
another
the
voter
marks
clearly
in
the
list
of
the
candidates
the
order
of
his
preference
by
placing
and
so
forth
against
the
names
in
the
subsequent
counting
the
voting
papers
are
first
classified
according
to
the
first
votes
let
us
suppose
that
popular
person
a
is
found
to
have
received
first
votes
enormously
in
excess
of
what
is
needed
to
return
him
the
second
votes
are
then
counted
on
his
papers
and
after
the
number
of
votes
necessary
to
return
him
has
been
deducted
the
surplus
votes
are
divided
in
due
proportion
among
the
second
choice
names
and
count
for
them
that
is
the
essential
idea
of
the
whole
thing
at
a
stroke
all
that
anxiety
about
wasting
votes
and
splitting
votes
is
the
secret
of
all
party
political
vanishes
you
may
vote
for
a
well
knowing
that
if
he
is
safe
your
vote
will
be
good
for
you
can
make
sure
of
a
and
at
the
same
time
vote
for
you
are
in
no
need
of
a
ticket
to
guide
you
and
you
need
have
no
fear
that
in
supporting
an
independent
candidate
you
will
destroy
the
prospects
of
some
tolerably
sympathetic
party
man
without
any
compensating
advantage
the
independent
candidate
does
in
fact
become
possible
for
the
first
time
the
hobson
choice
of
the
party
machine
is
abolished
let
me
be
a
little
more
precise
about
the
particulars
of
this
method
the
only
sound
method
of
voting
in
order
to
ensure
an
adequate
representation
of
the
community
let
us
resort
again
to
the
constituency
i
imagined
in
my
last
paper
a
constituency
in
which
candidates
represented
by
all
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
struggle
for
twelve
places
and
let
us
suppose
that
a
b
c
and
d
are
the
leading
favourites
suppose
that
there
are
twelve
thousand
voters
in
the
constituency
and
that
three
thousand
votes
are
cast
for
a
i
am
keeping
the
figures
as
simple
as
possible
then
a
has
two
thousand
more
than
is
needed
to
return
him
the
second
votes
on
his
papers
are
counted
and
it
is
found
that
or
a
fifth
of
them
go
to
c
or
a
sixth
go
to
e
or
a
tenth
to
g
to
j
or
a
fifteenth
each
to
k
and
l
and
a
hundred
each
or
a
thirtieth
to
m
n
o
p
q
r
s
t
w
and
z
then
the
surplus
of
is
divided
in
these
proportions
that
is
a
fifth
of
goes
to
c
a
sixth
to
e
and
the
rest
to
g
j
in
proportion
c
who
already
has
votes
gets
another
and
is
now
returned
and
has
moreover
to
spare
and
the
same
division
of
the
next
votes
upon
c
paper
occurs
as
has
already
been
made
with
a
but
previously
to
this
there
has
been
a
distribution
of
b
surplus
votes
b
having
got
of
first
votes
and
so
on
after
the
distribution
of
the
surplus
votes
of
the
elect
at
the
top
of
the
list
there
is
a
distribution
of
the
second
votes
upon
the
papers
of
those
who
have
voted
for
the
hopeless
candidates
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
at
last
a
point
is
reached
when
twelve
candidates
have
a
quota
in
this
way
the
wasting
of
a
vote
or
the
rejection
of
a
candidate
for
any
reason
except
that
hardly
anybody
wants
him
become
practically
impossible
this
method
of
the
single
transferable
vote
with
very
large
constituencies
and
many
members
does
in
fact
give
an
entirely
valid
electoral
result
each
vote
tells
for
all
it
is
worth
and
the
freedom
of
the
voter
is
only
limited
by
the
number
of
candidates
who
put
up
or
are
put
up
for
election
this
method
and
this
method
alone
gives
representative
government
all
others
of
the
hundred
and
one
possible
methods
admit
of
trickery
confusion
and
falsification
proportional
representation
is
not
a
faddist
proposal
not
a
perplexing
ingenious
complication
of
a
simple
business
it
is
the
carefully
worked
out
right
way
to
do
something
that
hitherto
we
have
been
doing
in
the
wrong
way
it
is
no
more
an
eccentricity
than
is
proper
baking
in
the
place
of
baking
amidst
dirt
and
with
unlimited
adulteration
or
the
running
of
trains
to
their
destinations
instead
of
running
them
without
notice
into
casually
selected
sidings
and
branch
lines
it
is
not
the
substitution
of
something
for
something
else
of
the
same
nature
it
is
the
substitution
of
right
for
wrong
it
is
the
plain
common
sense
of
the
greatest
difficulty
in
contemporary
affairs
i
know
that
a
number
of
people
do
not
will
not
admit
this
of
proportional
representation
perhaps
it
is
because
of
that
hideous
mouthful
of
words
for
a
thing
that
would
be
far
more
properly
named
sane
voting
this
which
is
the
only
correct
way
these
antagonists
regard
as
a
peculiar
way
it
has
unfamiliar
features
and
that
condemns
it
in
their
eyes
it
takes
at
least
ten
minutes
to
understand
and
that
is
too
much
for
their
plain
straightforward
souls
complicated
that
word
of
fear
they
are
like
the
man
who
approved
of
an
electric
tram
but
said
that
he
thought
it
would
go
better
without
all
that
of
wires
up
above
they
are
like
the
western
judge
in
the
murder
trial
who
said
that
if
only
they
got
a
man
hanged
for
this
abominable
crime
he
would
make
a
pedantic
fuss
about
the
question
of
man
they
are
like
the
plain
straightforward
promoter
who
became
impatient
with
maps
and
planned
a
railway
across
switzerland
by
drawing
a
straight
line
with
a
ruler
across
jungfrau
and
matterhorn
and
glacier
and
gorge
or
else
they
are
like
ramsay
macdonald
who
knows
too
well
what
would
happen
to
him
now
let
us
consider
what
would
be
the
necessary
consequences
of
the
establishment
of
proportional
representation
in
such
a
community
as
great
britain
that
is
to
say
the
redistribution
of
the
country
into
great
constituencies
such
as
london
or
ulster
or
wessex
or
south
wales
each
returning
a
score
or
more
of
members
and
the
establishment
of
voting
by
the
single
transferable
vote
the
first
immediate
most
desirable
result
would
be
the
disappearance
of
the
undistinguished
party
candidate
he
would
vanish
altogether
he
would
be
no
more
seen
proportional
representation
would
not
give
him
the
ghost
of
a
chance
the
very
young
man
of
good
family
the
subsidised
barrister
the
respectable
nobody
the
rich
supporter
of
the
party
would
be
ousted
by
known
men
no
candidate
who
had
not
already
distinguished
himself
and
who
did
not
stand
for
something
in
the
public
eye
would
have
a
chance
of
election
there
alone
we
have
a
sufficient
reason
for
anticipating
a
very
thorough
change
in
the
quality
and
character
of
the
average
legislator
and
next
no
party
organisation
no
intimation
from
headquarters
no
dirty
tricks
behind
the
scenes
no
conspiracy
of
spite
and
scandal
would
have
much
chance
of
keeping
out
any
man
of
real
force
and
distinction
who
had
impressed
the
public
imagination
to
be
famous
in
science
to
have
led
thought
to
have
explored
or
administered
or
dissented
courageously
from
the
schemes
of
official
would
no
longer
be
a
bar
to
a
man
attainment
of
parliament
it
would
be
a
help
not
only
the
level
of
parliamentary
intelligence
but
the
level
of
personal
independence
would
be
raised
far
above
its
present
position
and
parliament
would
become
a
gathering
of
prominent
men
instead
of
a
means
to
prominence
the
system
which
holds
all
the
countries
in
its
grip
would
certainly
be
broken
up
by
proportional
representation
sane
voting
in
the
end
would
kill
the
liberal
and
tory
and
democratic
and
republican
that
secret
rottenness
of
our
public
life
that
hidden
conclave
which
sells
honours
fouls
finance
muddles
public
affairs
fools
the
passionate
desires
of
the
people
and
ruins
honest
men
by
obscure
campaigns
would
become
impossible
the
advantage
of
party
support
would
be
a
doubtful
advantage
and
in
parliament
itself
the
party
men
would
find
themselves
outclassed
and
possibly
even
outnumbered
by
the
independent
it
would
be
only
a
matter
of
a
few
years
between
the
adoption
of
sane
voting
and
the
disappearance
of
the
cabinet
from
british
public
life
it
would
become
possible
for
parliament
to
get
rid
of
a
minister
without
getting
rid
of
a
ministry
and
to
express
its
disapproval
of
let
us
say
some
foolish
project
for
rearranging
the
local
government
of
ireland
without
opening
the
door
upon
a
vista
of
fantastical
fiscal
adventures
the
cabinet
which
is
now
the
real
government
of
the
democratic
countries
would
cease
to
be
so
and
government
would
revert
more
and
more
to
the
legislative
assembly
and
not
only
would
the
latter
body
resume
government
but
it
would
also
necessarily
take
into
itself
all
those
large
and
growing
exponents
of
discontent
that
now
darken
the
social
future
the
case
of
the
armed
unionist
rebel
in
ulster
the
case
of
the
workman
who
engages
in
sabotage
the
case
for
sympathetic
strikes
and
the
general
strike
all
these
cases
are
identical
in
this
that
they
declare
parliament
a
fraud
that
justice
lies
outside
it
and
hopelessly
outside
it
and
that
to
seek
redress
through
parliament
is
a
waste
of
time
and
energy
sane
voting
would
deprive
all
these
destructive
movements
of
the
excuse
and
necessity
for
violence
there
is
i
know
a
disposition
in
some
quarters
to
minimise
the
importance
of
proportional
representation
as
though
it
were
a
mere
readjustment
of
voting
methods
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
it
is
a
prospective
revolution
it
will
revolutionise
government
far
more
than
a
mere
change
from
kingdom
to
republic
or
vice
versa
could
possibly
do
it
will
give
a
new
and
unprecedented
sort
of
government
to
the
world
the
real
leaders
of
the
country
will
govern
the
country
for
great
britain
for
example
instead
of
the
secret
dubious
and
dubitable
cabinet
which
is
the
real
british
government
of
poised
on
an
unwieldy
and
crowded
house
of
commons
we
should
have
open
government
by
the
representatives
of
let
us
say
twenty
great
provinces
ulster
wales
london
for
example
each
returning
from
twelve
to
thirty
members
it
would
be
a
steadier
stabler
more
confident
and
more
trusted
government
than
the
world
has
ever
seen
before
ministers
indeed
and
even
ministries
might
come
and
go
but
that
would
not
matter
as
it
does
now
because
there
would
be
endless
alternatives
through
which
the
assembly
could
express
itself
instead
of
the
choice
between
two
parties
the
arguments
against
proportional
representation
that
have
been
advanced
hitherto
are
trivial
in
comparison
with
its
enormous
advantages
implicit
in
them
all
is
the
supposition
that
public
opinion
is
at
bottom
a
foolish
thing
and
that
electoral
methods
are
to
pacify
rather
than
express
a
people
it
is
possibly
true
that
notorious
windbags
conspicuously
advertised
adventurers
and
the
heroes
of
temporary
sensations
may
run
a
considerable
chance
upon
the
lists
my
own
estimate
of
the
popular
wisdom
is
against
the
idea
that
any
vividly
prominent
figure
must
needs
get
in
i
think
the
public
is
capable
of
appreciating
let
us
say
the
charm
and
interest
of
sandow
or
jack
johnson
or
harry
lauder
or
evan
roberts
without
wanting
to
send
these
gentlemen
into
parliament
and
i
think
that
the
increased
power
that
the
press
would
have
through
its
facilities
in
making
reputations
may
also
be
exaggerated
reputations
are
mysterious
things
and
not
so
easily
forced
and
even
if
it
were
possible
for
a
section
of
the
press
to
limelight
a
dozen
or
so
figures
up
to
the
legislature
they
would
still
have
i
think
to
be
interesting
sympathetic
and
individualised
figures
and
at
the
end
they
would
be
only
half
a
dozen
among
four
hundred
men
of
a
repute
more
naturally
achieved
a
third
objection
is
that
this
reform
would
give
us
group
politics
and
unstable
government
it
might
very
possibly
give
us
unstable
ministries
but
unstable
ministries
may
mean
stable
government
and
such
stable
ministries
as
that
which
governs
england
at
the
present
time
may
by
clinging
obstinately
to
office
mean
the
wildest
fluctuations
of
policy
ramsay
macdonald
has
drawn
a
picture
of
the
parliament
of
proportional
representation
split
up
into
groups
each
pledged
to
specific
measures
and
making
the
most
extraordinary
treaties
and
sacrifices
of
the
public
interest
in
order
to
secure
the
passing
of
these
definite
bills
but
ramsay
macdonald
is
exclusively
a
parliamentary
man
he
knows
contemporary
parliamentary
shop
as
a
clerk
knows
his
and
he
thinks
in
the
terms
of
his
habitual
life
he
sees
representatives
only
as
politicians
financed
from
party
headquarters
it
is
natural
that
he
should
fail
to
see
that
the
quality
and
condition
of
the
sanely
elected
member
of
parliament
will
be
quite
different
from
these
scheming
climbers
into
positions
of
trust
with
whom
he
deals
it
is
the
party
system
based
on
insane
voting
that
makes
governments
indivisible
wholes
and
gives
the
group
and
the
cave
their
terrors
and
their
effectiveness
ramsay
macdonald
is
as
typical
a
product
of
existing
electoral
methods
as
one
could
well
have
and
his
peculiarly
keen
sense
of
the
power
of
intrigue
in
legislation
is
as
good
evidence
as
one
could
wish
for
of
the
need
for
drastic
change
of
course
sane
voting
is
not
a
short
cut
to
the
millennium
it
is
no
way
of
changing
human
nature
and
in
the
new
type
of
assembly
as
in
the
old
spite
vanity
indolence
and
downright
dishonesty
will
play
their
part
but
to
object
to
a
reform
on
that
account
is
not
a
particularly
effective
objection
these
things
will
play
their
part
but
it
will
be
a
much
smaller
part
in
the
new
than
in
the
old
it
is
like
objecting
to
some
projected
and
railway
because
it
does
not
propose
to
carry
its
passengers
by
immediate
express
to
heaven
the
american
population
sec
the
social
conditions
and
social
future
of
america
constitute
a
system
of
problems
quite
distinct
and
separate
from
the
social
problems
of
any
other
part
of
the
world
the
nearest
approach
to
parallel
conditions
and
that
on
a
far
smaller
and
narrower
scale
is
found
in
the
british
colonies
and
in
the
newly
settled
parts
of
siberia
for
while
in
nearly
every
other
part
of
the
world
the
population
of
is
more
or
less
completely
descended
from
the
prehistoric
population
of
the
same
region
and
has
developed
its
social
order
in
a
slow
growth
extending
over
many
centuries
the
american
population
is
essentially
a
transplanted
population
a
still
fluid
and
imperfect
fusion
of
great
fragments
torn
at
this
point
or
that
from
the
gradually
evolved
societies
of
europe
the
european
social
systems
grow
and
flower
upon
their
roots
in
soil
which
has
made
them
and
to
which
they
are
adapted
the
american
social
accumulation
is
a
various
collection
of
cuttings
thrust
into
a
new
soil
and
respiring
a
new
air
so
different
that
the
question
is
still
open
to
doubt
and
indeed
there
are
those
who
do
doubt
how
far
these
cuttings
are
actually
striking
root
and
living
and
growing
whether
indeed
they
are
destined
to
more
than
a
temporary
life
in
the
new
hemisphere
i
propose
to
discuss
and
weigh
certain
arguments
for
and
against
the
belief
that
these
ninety
million
people
who
constitute
the
united
states
of
america
are
destined
to
develop
into
a
great
distinctive
nation
with
a
character
and
culture
of
its
own
humanly
speaking
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
same
is
true
of
canada
and
all
the
more
prosperous
populous
and
progressive
regions
of
south
america
is
a
vast
sea
of
newly
arrived
and
unstably
rooted
people
of
the
million
inhabitants
recorded
by
the
census
ten
and
a
half
million
were
born
and
brought
up
in
one
or
other
of
the
european
social
systems
and
the
parents
of
another
millions
were
foreigners
another
nine
million
are
of
african
negro
descent
fourteen
million
of
the
million
are
living
not
in
the
state
of
their
birth
but
in
other
states
to
which
they
have
migrated
of
the
thirty
and
a
half
million
whites
whose
parents
on
both
sides
were
native
americans
a
high
proportion
probably
had
one
if
not
more
nearly
five
and
a
half
million
out
of
and
a
half
million
whites
in
were
and
another
five
and
a
quarter
million
the
children
of
parents
the
children
of
the
latter
five
and
a
quarter
million
count
of
course
in
the
census
as
of
native
parents
immigration
varies
enormously
with
the
activity
of
business
but
in
it
rose
for
the
first
time
above
a
million
these
figures
may
be
difficult
to
grasp
the
facts
may
be
seen
in
a
more
concrete
form
by
the
visitor
to
ellis
island
the
receiving
station
for
the
immigrants
into
new
york
harbour
one
goes
to
this
place
by
tugs
from
the
united
states
barge
office
in
battery
park
and
in
order
to
see
the
thing
properly
one
needs
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
commissioner
in
charge
then
one
is
taken
through
vast
barracks
littered
with
people
of
every
european
race
every
type
of
european
costume
and
every
degree
of
dirtiness
to
a
central
hall
in
which
the
gist
of
the
examining
goes
on
the
floor
of
this
hall
is
divided
up
into
a
sort
of
maze
of
winding
passages
between
lattice
work
and
along
these
passages
day
after
day
incessantly
the
immigrants
go
gipsies
armenians
greeks
italians
ruthenians
cossacks
german
peasants
scandinavians
a
few
irish
still
impoverished
english
occasional
dutch
they
halt
for
a
moment
at
little
desks
to
exhibit
papers
at
other
little
desks
to
show
their
money
and
prove
they
are
not
paupers
to
have
their
eyes
scanned
by
this
doctor
and
their
general
bearing
by
that
their
are
taken
their
names
and
heights
and
weights
and
so
forth
are
recorded
for
the
card
index
and
so
slowly
they
pass
along
towards
america
and
at
last
reach
a
little
wicket
the
gate
of
the
new
world
through
this
metal
wicket
drips
the
immigration
stream
all
day
long
every
two
or
three
seconds
an
immigrant
with
a
valise
or
a
bundle
passes
the
little
desk
and
goes
on
past
the
place
past
the
carefully
organised
separating
ways
that
go
to
this
railway
or
that
past
the
guiding
protecting
officials
into
a
new
world
the
great
majority
are
young
men
and
young
women
between
seventeen
and
thirty
good
youthful
hopeful
peasant
stock
they
stand
in
a
long
string
waiting
to
go
through
that
wicket
with
bundles
with
little
tin
boxes
with
cheap
portmanteaus
with
odd
packages
in
pairs
in
families
alone
women
with
children
men
with
strings
of
dependents
young
couples
all
day
that
string
of
human
beads
waits
there
jerks
forward
waits
again
all
day
and
every
day
constantly
replenished
constantly
dropping
the
end
beads
through
the
wicket
till
the
units
mount
to
hundreds
and
the
hundreds
to
thousands
in
such
a
prosperous
year
as
more
immigrants
passed
through
that
wicket
into
america
than
children
were
born
in
the
whole
of
france
this
figure
of
a
perpetual
stream
of
new
stranger
citizens
will
serve
to
mark
the
primary
distinction
between
the
american
social
problem
and
that
of
any
european
or
asiatic
community
the
vast
bulk
of
the
population
of
the
united
states
has
in
fact
only
got
there
from
europe
in
the
course
of
the
last
hundred
years
and
mainly
since
the
accession
of
queen
victoria
to
the
throne
of
great
britain
that
is
the
first
fact
that
the
student
of
the
american
social
future
must
realise
only
an
extremely
small
proportion
of
its
blood
goes
back
now
to
those
who
fought
for
freedom
in
the
days
of
george
washington
the
american
community
is
not
an
expanded
colonial
society
that
has
become
autonomous
it
is
a
great
and
deepening
pool
of
population
accumulating
upon
the
area
these
predecessors
freed
and
since
fed
copiously
by
affluents
from
every
european
community
fresh
ingredients
are
still
being
added
in
enormous
quantity
in
quantity
so
great
as
to
materially
change
the
racial
quality
in
a
score
of
years
it
is
particularly
noteworthy
that
each
accession
of
new
blood
seems
to
sterilise
its
predecessors
had
there
been
no
immigration
at
all
into
the
united
states
but
had
the
rate
of
increase
that
prevailed
in
prevailed
to
the
population
which
would
then
have
been
a
purely
native
american
one
would
have
amounted
to
a
hundred
million
that
is
to
say
to
approximately
nine
million
in
excess
of
the
present
total
population
the
new
waves
are
for
a
time
amazingly
fecund
and
then
comes
a
rapid
fall
in
the
the
proportion
of
colonial
and
early
republican
blood
in
the
population
is
therefore
probably
far
smaller
even
than
the
figures
i
have
quoted
would
suggest
these
accesses
of
new
population
have
come
in
a
series
of
waves
very
much
as
if
successive
reservoirs
of
surplus
population
in
the
old
world
had
been
tapped
drained
and
exhausted
first
came
the
irish
and
germans
then
central
europeans
of
various
types
then
poland
and
western
russia
began
to
pour
out
their
teeming
peoples
and
more
particularly
their
jews
bohemia
the
slavonic
states
italy
and
hungary
followed
and
the
latest
arrivals
include
great
numbers
of
levantines
armenians
and
other
peoples
from
asia
minor
and
the
balkan
peninsula
the
hungarian
immigrants
have
still
a
of
per
thousand
the
highest
in
the
world
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
mediterranean
arrivals
it
has
to
be
noted
and
more
especially
the
italians
do
not
come
to
settle
they
work
for
a
season
or
a
few
years
and
then
return
to
italy
the
rest
come
to
stay
a
vast
proportion
of
these
accessions
to
the
american
population
since
has
with
the
exception
of
the
east
european
jews
consisted
of
peasantry
mainly
or
totally
illiterate
accustomed
to
a
low
standard
of
life
and
heavy
bodily
toil
for
most
of
them
the
transfer
to
a
new
country
meant
severance
from
the
religious
communion
in
which
they
had
been
bred
and
from
the
servilities
or
subordinations
to
which
they
were
accustomed
they
brought
little
or
no
positive
social
tradition
to
the
synthesis
to
which
they
brought
their
blood
and
muscle
the
earlier
german
english
and
scandinavian
incomers
were
drawn
from
a
somewhat
higher
social
level
and
were
much
more
closely
akin
in
habits
and
faith
to
the
earlier
founders
of
the
republic
our
inquiry
is
this
what
social
structure
is
this
pool
of
mixed
humanity
developing
or
likely
to
develop
sec
if
we
compare
any
european
nation
with
the
american
we
perceive
at
once
certain
broad
differences
the
former
in
comparison
with
the
latter
is
evolved
and
organised
the
latter
in
comparison
with
the
former
is
aggregated
and
chaotic
in
nearly
every
european
country
there
is
a
social
system
often
quite
elaborately
classed
and
defined
each
class
with
a
sense
of
function
with
an
idea
of
what
is
due
to
it
and
what
is
expected
of
it
nearly
everywhere
you
find
a
governing
class
aristocratic
in
spirit
sometimes
no
doubt
highly
modified
by
recent
economic
and
industrial
changes
with
more
or
less
of
the
tradition
of
a
feudal
nobility
then
a
definite
great
mercantile
class
then
a
large
middle
class
of
professional
men
minor
merchants
and
so
forth
then
a
new
industrial
class
of
employees
in
the
manufacturing
and
urban
districts
and
a
peasant
population
rooted
to
the
land
there
are
of
course
many
local
modifications
of
this
form
in
france
the
nobility
is
mostly
expropriated
in
england
since
the
days
of
john
bull
the
peasant
has
lost
his
common
rights
and
his
holding
and
become
an
agricultural
labourer
to
a
newer
class
of
more
extensive
farmer
but
these
are
differences
in
detail
the
fact
of
the
organisation
and
the
still
more
important
fact
of
the
traditional
feeling
of
organisation
remain
true
of
all
these
older
communities
and
in
nearly
every
european
country
though
it
may
be
somewhat
despoiled
here
and
shorn
of
exclusive
predominance
there
or
represented
by
a
dislocated
reformed
member
is
the
church
custodian
of
a
great
moral
tradition
closely
associated
with
the
national
universities
and
the
organisation
of
national
thought
the
typical
european
town
has
its
castle
or
great
house
its
cathedral
or
church
its
and
quarters
five
miles
off
one
can
see
that
the
american
town
is
on
an
entirely
different
plan
in
his
remarkable
american
scene
henry
james
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
church
as
one
sees
it
and
feels
it
universally
in
europe
is
altogether
absent
and
he
adds
a
comment
as
suggestive
as
it
is
vague
speaking
of
the
appearance
of
the
churches
so
far
as
they
do
appear
amidst
american
urban
scenery
he
says
looking
for
the
most
part
no
more
established
or
seated
than
a
stopped
omnibus
they
are
reduced
to
the
inveterate
bourgeois
level
that
of
private
accommodated
pretensions
merely
and
fatally
despoiled
of
the
fine
old
ecclesiastical
arrogance
the
field
of
american
life
is
as
bare
of
the
church
as
a
of
a
a
truth
that
the
myriad
little
structures
on
sundays
and
on
the
evenings
of
their
proclaim
as
with
the
audible
sound
of
the
roaring
of
a
million
mice
and
however
one
indicates
one
impression
of
the
clearance
the
clearance
itself
in
its
completeness
with
the
innumerable
odd
connected
circumstances
that
bring
it
home
represents
in
the
history
of
manners
and
morals
a
deviation
in
the
mere
measurement
of
which
hereafter
may
well
reside
a
certain
critical
thrill
i
say
hereafter
because
it
is
a
question
of
one
of
those
many
measurements
that
would
as
yet
in
the
united
states
be
premature
of
all
the
solemn
conclusions
one
feels
as
the
list
is
quite
headed
in
the
states
i
think
by
this
particular
abeyance
of
judgment
when
an
ancient
treasure
of
precious
vessels
overscored
with
glowing
gems
and
wrought
artistically
into
wondrous
shapes
has
by
a
prodigious
process
been
converted
through
a
vast
community
into
the
small
change
the
simple
circulating
medium
of
dollars
and
we
can
only
say
that
the
consequent
permeation
will
be
of
values
of
a
new
order
of
order
we
must
wait
to
see
america
has
no
church
neither
has
it
a
peasantry
nor
an
aristocracy
and
until
well
on
in
the
victorian
epoch
it
had
no
disproportionately
rich
people
in
america
except
in
the
regions
where
the
negro
abounds
there
is
no
lower
stratum
there
is
no
soil
people
to
this
community
at
all
your
man
is
a
mobile
freeman
who
can
read
and
who
has
ideas
above
digging
and
pigs
and
except
incidentally
for
his
own
ends
no
one
owns
to
subordination
as
a
consequence
any
position
which
involves
the
acknowledgment
of
an
innate
inferiority
is
difficult
to
fill
there
is
from
the
european
point
of
view
an
extraordinary
dearth
of
servants
and
this
endures
in
spite
of
a
great
peasant
immigration
the
servile
tradition
will
not
root
here
now
it
dies
forthwith
an
enormous
importation
of
european
serfs
and
peasants
goes
on
but
as
they
touch
this
soil
their
backs
begin
to
stiffen
with
a
new
assertion
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
also
one
misses
an
element
there
is
no
territorial
aristocracy
no
aristocracy
at
all
no
throne
no
legitimate
and
acknowledged
representative
of
that
upper
social
structure
of
leisure
power
and
state
responsibility
which
in
the
old
european
theory
of
society
was
supposed
to
give
significance
to
the
whole
the
american
community
one
can
not
too
clearly
insist
does
not
correspond
to
an
entire
european
community
at
all
but
only
to
the
middle
masses
of
it
to
the
trading
and
manufacturing
class
between
the
dimensions
of
the
magnate
and
the
clerk
and
skilled
artisan
it
is
the
central
part
of
the
european
organism
without
either
the
dreaming
head
or
the
subjugated
feet
even
the
highly
feudal
county
family
traditions
of
virginia
and
the
south
pass
now
out
of
memory
so
that
in
a
very
real
sense
the
past
of
the
american
nation
is
in
europe
and
the
settled
order
of
the
past
is
left
behind
there
this
community
was
as
it
were
taken
off
its
roots
clipped
of
its
branches
and
brought
hither
it
began
neither
serf
nor
lord
but
burgher
and
farmer
it
followed
the
normal
development
of
the
middle
class
under
progress
everywhere
and
became
capitalistic
the
huge
later
immigration
has
converged
upon
the
great
industrial
centres
and
added
merely
a
vast
element
of
employees
to
the
scheme
america
has
been
and
still
very
largely
is
a
country
it
is
a
great
sea
of
human
beings
detached
from
their
traditions
of
origin
the
social
difference
from
europe
appears
everywhere
and
nowhere
more
strikingly
than
in
the
railway
carriages
in
england
the
compartments
in
these
are
either
first
class
originally
designed
for
the
aristocracy
or
second
class
for
the
middle
class
or
third
class
for
the
populace
in
america
there
is
only
one
class
one
universal
simple
democratic
car
in
the
southern
states
however
a
proportion
of
these
simple
democratic
cars
are
inscribed
with
the
word
white
whereby
nine
million
people
are
excluded
but
to
this
original
treatment
there
was
speedily
added
a
more
sumptuous
type
of
car
the
parlour
car
accessible
to
extra
dollars
and
then
came
special
types
of
train
all
made
up
of
parlour
cars
and
observation
cars
and
the
like
in
england
nearly
every
train
remains
still
first
second
and
third
or
first
and
third
and
now
quite
outdistancing
the
differentiation
of
england
america
produces
private
cars
and
private
trains
such
as
europe
reserves
only
for
crowned
heads
the
evidence
of
the
american
railways
then
suggests
very
strongly
what
a
hundred
other
signs
confirm
that
the
huge
classless
sea
of
american
population
is
not
destined
to
remain
classless
is
already
developing
separations
and
distinctions
and
structures
of
its
own
and
monstrous
architectural
portents
in
boston
and
salt
lake
city
encourage
one
to
suppose
that
even
that
churchless
aspect
which
so
stirred
the
speculative
element
in
henry
james
is
only
the
opening
formless
phase
of
a
community
destined
to
produce
not
only
classes
but
intellectual
and
moral
forms
of
the
most
remarkable
kind
sec
it
is
well
to
note
how
these
ninety
millions
of
people
whose
social
future
we
are
discussing
are
distributed
this
huge
development
of
human
appliances
and
resources
is
here
going
on
in
a
community
that
is
still
for
all
the
dense
crowds
of
new
york
the
teeming
congestion
of
east
side
extraordinarily
scattered
america
one
recalls
is
still
an
unoccupied
country
across
which
the
latest
developments
of
civilisation
are
rushing
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
continuous
area
of
land
which
is
leaving
alaska
out
of
account
altogether
equal
to
great
britain
france
the
german
empire
the
empire
italy
belgium
japan
holland
spain
and
portugal
sweden
and
norway
turkey
in
europe
egypt
and
the
whole
empire
of
india
and
the
population
spread
out
over
this
vast
space
is
still
less
than
the
joint
population
of
the
first
two
countries
named
and
not
a
quarter
that
of
india
moreover
it
is
not
spread
at
all
evenly
much
of
it
is
in
undistributed
clots
it
is
not
upon
the
soil
barely
half
of
it
is
in
holdings
and
homes
and
authentic
communities
it
is
a
population
of
an
extremely
modern
type
urban
concentration
has
already
gone
far
with
it
fifteen
millions
of
it
are
crowded
into
and
about
twenty
great
cities
another
eighteen
millions
make
up
five
hundred
towns
between
these
centres
of
population
run
railways
indeed
telegraph
wires
telephone
connections
tracks
of
various
sorts
but
to
the
european
eye
these
are
mere
scratchings
on
a
virgin
surface
an
empty
wilderness
manifests
itself
through
this
thin
network
of
human
conveniences
appears
in
the
meshes
even
at
the
railroad
side
essentially
america
is
still
an
unsettled
land
with
only
a
few
incidental
good
roads
in
favoured
places
with
no
universal
police
with
no
wayside
inns
where
a
civilised
man
may
rest
with
still
only
the
crudest
of
rural
postal
deliveries
with
long
stretches
of
swamp
and
forest
and
desert
by
the
track
side
still
unassailed
by
industry
this
much
one
sees
clearly
enough
eastward
of
chicago
westward
it
becomes
more
and
more
the
fact
in
idaho
at
last
comes
the
untouched
and
perhaps
invincible
desert
plain
and
continuous
through
the
long
hours
of
travel
huge
areas
do
not
contain
one
human
being
to
the
square
mile
still
vaster
portions
fall
short
of
two
it
is
upon
pennsylvania
and
new
york
state
and
the
belt
of
great
towns
that
stretches
out
past
chicago
to
milwaukee
and
madison
that
the
nation
centres
and
seems
destined
to
centre
one
needs
but
examine
a
tinted
population
map
to
realise
that
the
other
concentrations
are
provincial
and
subordinate
they
have
the
same
relation
to
the
main
axis
that
glasgow
or
cardiff
have
to
london
in
the
british
scheme
sec
when
i
speak
of
this
vast
multitude
these
ninety
millions
of
the
united
states
of
america
as
being
for
the
most
part
peasants
and
common
people
cut
off
from
their
own
social
traditions
i
do
not
intend
to
convey
that
the
american
community
is
as
a
whole
traditionless
there
is
in
america
a
very
distinctive
tradition
indeed
which
animates
the
entire
nation
gives
a
unique
idiom
to
its
press
and
all
its
public
utterances
and
is
manifestly
the
starting
point
from
which
the
adjustments
of
the
future
must
be
made
the
mere
sight
of
the
stars
and
stripes
serves
to
recall
it
yankee
in
the
mouth
of
a
european
gives
something
of
its
quality
one
thinks
at
once
of
a
careless
abandonment
of
any
pretension
of
tireless
energy
and
daring
enterprise
of
immense
of
a
disrespect
for
the
past
so
complete
that
a
mummy
is
in
itself
a
comical
object
and
the
blowing
out
of
an
sacred
flame
a
delightful
jest
one
thinks
of
the
enterprise
of
the
and
the
humour
of
a
yankee
at
the
court
of
king
arthur
and
of
innocents
abroad
its
dominant
notes
are
democracy
freedom
and
confidence
it
is
without
superstition
consciously
christian
in
the
vein
of
a
nearly
unitarian
christianity
fervent
but
broadened
broadened
as
a
halfpenny
is
broadened
by
being
run
over
by
an
express
train
substantially
the
same
that
is
to
say
but
with
a
marked
loss
of
outline
and
detail
it
is
a
tradition
of
romantic
concession
to
good
and
inoffensive
women
and
a
high
development
of
that
personal
morality
which
puts
sexual
continence
and
alcoholic
temperance
before
any
public
virtue
it
is
equally
a
tradition
of
sporadic
emotional
entirely
of
the
quality
of
gallantry
of
handsome
and
surprising
gifts
to
the
people
disinterested
occupation
of
office
and
the
like
it
is
emotionally
patriotic
hypotheticating
fighting
and
dying
for
country
as
a
supreme
good
while
inculcating
also
that
working
and
living
for
oneself
is
quite
within
the
sphere
of
virtuous
action
it
adores
the
flag
but
suspects
the
state
one
sees
more
national
flags
and
fewer
national
servants
in
america
than
in
any
country
in
the
world
its
conception
of
manners
is
one
of
free
men
revering
women
and
shielding
them
from
most
of
the
realities
of
life
scornful
of
aristocracies
and
monarchies
while
asserting
simply
directly
boldly
and
frequently
an
equal
claim
to
consideration
with
all
other
men
if
there
is
any
traditional
national
costume
it
is
and
it
cherishes
the
rights
of
property
above
any
other
right
whatsoever
such
are
the
details
that
come
clustering
into
one
mind
in
response
to
the
phrase
the
american
tradition
from
the
war
of
independence
onward
until
our
own
times
that
tradition
that
very
definite
ideal
has
kept
pretty
steadily
the
same
it
is
the
image
of
a
man
and
not
the
image
of
a
state
its
living
spirit
has
been
the
spirit
of
freedom
at
any
cost
unconditional
and
irresponsible
it
is
the
spirit
of
men
who
have
thrown
off
a
yoke
who
are
jealously
resolved
to
be
unhampered
masters
of
their
own
to
whom
nothing
else
is
of
anything
but
secondary
importance
that
was
the
spirit
of
the
english
small
gentry
and
mercantile
class
the
comfortable
property
owners
the
parliamentarians
in
stuart
times
indeed
even
earlier
it
is
very
largely
the
spirit
of
more
utopia
it
was
that
spirit
sent
oliver
cromwell
himself
packing
for
america
though
a
heedless
and
and
unforeseeing
king
would
not
let
him
go
it
was
the
spirit
that
made
taxation
for
public
purposes
the
supreme
wrong
and
provoked
each
country
first
the
mother
country
and
then
in
its
turn
the
daughter
country
to
armed
rebellion
it
has
been
the
spirit
of
the
british
whig
and
the
british
nonconformist
almost
up
to
the
present
day
in
the
reform
club
of
london
framed
and
glazed
over
against
magna
charta
is
the
american
declaration
of
independence
kindred
trophies
they
are
of
the
same
essentially
english
spirit
of
stubborn
insubordination
but
the
american
side
of
it
has
gone
on
unchecked
by
the
complementary
aspect
of
the
english
character
which
british
toryism
expresses
the
war
of
independence
raised
that
whig
suspicion
of
and
hostility
to
government
and
the
freedom
of
private
property
and
the
repudiation
of
any
but
voluntary
emotional
and
supererogatory
in
the
national
purpose
to
the
level
of
a
religion
and
the
american
constitution
with
but
one
element
of
elasticity
in
the
supreme
court
decisions
established
these
principles
impregnably
in
the
political
structure
it
organised
disorganisation
personal
freedom
defiance
of
authority
and
the
stars
and
stripes
have
always
gone
together
in
minds
and
subsequent
waves
of
immigration
the
irish
fleeing
famine
for
which
they
held
the
english
responsible
and
the
eastern
european
jews
escaping
relentless
persecutions
brought
a
persuasion
of
immense
public
wrongs
as
a
necessary
concomitant
of
systematic
government
to
refresh
without
changing
this
defiant
thirst
for
freedom
at
any
cost
in
my
book
the
future
in
america
i
have
tried
to
make
an
estimate
of
the
working
quality
of
this
american
tradition
of
unconditional
freedom
for
the
adult
male
citizen
i
have
shown
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
anyone
who
regards
civilisation
as
an
organisation
of
human
interdependence
and
believes
that
the
stability
of
society
can
be
secured
only
by
a
conscious
and
disciplined
of
effort
it
is
a
tradition
extraordinarily
and
dangerously
deficient
in
what
i
have
called
a
of
the
and
by
a
sense
of
the
state
i
mean
not
merely
a
vague
and
sentimental
and
showy
of
that
the
states
have
enough
and
to
spare
but
a
real
sustaining
conception
of
the
collective
interest
embodied
in
the
state
as
an
object
of
simple
duty
and
as
a
determining
factor
in
the
life
of
each
individual
it
involves
a
sense
of
function
and
a
sense
of
place
a
sense
of
a
general
responsibility
and
of
a
general
overriding
the
individual
which
are
exactly
the
senses
the
american
tradition
attacks
and
destroys
for
the
better
part
of
a
century
the
american
tradition
quite
as
much
by
reason
of
what
it
disregards
as
of
what
it
suggests
has
meant
a
great
release
of
human
energy
a
vigorous
if
rough
and
untidy
exploitation
of
the
vast
resources
that
the
european
invention
of
railways
and
telegraphic
communication
put
within
reach
of
the
american
people
it
has
stimulated
men
to
a
greater
individual
activity
perhaps
than
the
world
has
ever
seen
before
men
have
been
wasted
by
misdirection
no
doubt
but
there
has
been
less
waste
by
inaction
and
lassitude
than
was
the
case
in
any
previous
society
great
bulks
of
things
and
great
quantities
of
things
have
been
produced
huge
areas
brought
under
cultivation
vast
cities
reared
in
the
wilderness
but
this
tradition
has
failed
to
produce
the
beginnings
or
promise
of
any
new
phase
of
civilised
organisation
the
growths
have
remained
largely
invertebrate
and
chaotic
and
concurrently
with
its
gift
of
splendid
and
monstrous
growth
it
has
also
developed
portentous
political
and
economic
evils
no
doubt
the
increment
of
human
energy
has
been
considerable
but
it
has
been
much
less
than
appears
at
first
sight
much
of
the
human
energy
that
america
has
displayed
in
the
last
century
is
not
a
development
of
new
energy
but
a
diversion
it
has
been
accompanied
by
a
fall
in
the
that
even
the
immigration
torrent
has
not
altogether
replaced
its
insistence
on
the
individual
its
disregard
of
the
collective
organisation
its
treatment
of
women
and
children
as
each
man
private
concern
has
had
its
natural
outcome
men
imaginations
have
been
turned
entirely
upon
individual
and
immediate
successes
and
upon
concrete
triumphs
they
have
had
no
regard
or
only
an
ineffectual
sentimental
regard
for
the
race
every
man
was
looking
after
himself
and
there
was
no
one
to
look
after
the
future
had
the
promise
of
been
fulfilled
there
would
now
be
in
the
united
states
of
america
one
hundred
million
descendants
of
the
homogeneous
and
native
population
of
that
time
there
is
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
more
than
million
there
is
probably
as
i
have
pointed
out
much
less
against
the
assets
of
cities
railways
mines
and
industrial
wealth
won
the
american
tradition
has
to
set
the
price
of
million
native
citizens
who
have
never
found
time
to
get
born
and
whose
place
is
now
more
or
less
filled
by
alien
substitutes
biologically
speaking
this
is
not
a
triumph
for
the
american
tradition
it
is
however
very
clearly
an
outcome
of
the
intense
individualism
of
that
tradition
under
the
sway
of
that
it
has
burnt
its
future
in
the
furnace
to
keep
up
steam
the
next
and
necessary
evil
consequent
upon
this
exaltation
of
the
individual
and
private
property
over
the
state
over
the
race
that
is
and
over
public
property
has
been
a
contempt
for
public
service
it
has
identified
public
spirit
with
spasmodic
acts
of
public
beneficence
the
american
political
ideal
became
a
cincinnatus
whom
nobody
sent
for
and
who
therefore
never
left
his
plough
there
has
ensued
a
corrupt
and
undignified
political
life
speaking
claptrap
dark
with
violence
illiterate
and
void
of
statesmanship
or
science
forbidding
any
healthy
social
development
through
public
organisation
at
home
and
every
year
that
the
increasing
facilities
of
communication
draw
the
alien
nations
closer
deepening
the
risks
of
needless
and
disastrous
wars
abroad
and
in
the
third
place
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
american
tradition
has
defeated
its
dearest
aims
of
a
universal
freedom
and
a
practical
equality
the
economic
process
of
the
last
so
far
as
america
is
concerned
has
completely
justified
the
generalisations
of
marx
there
has
been
a
steady
concentration
of
wealth
and
of
the
reality
as
distinguished
from
the
forms
of
power
in
the
hands
of
a
small
energetic
minority
and
a
steady
approximation
of
the
condition
of
the
mass
of
the
citizens
to
that
of
the
proletariat
of
the
european
communities
the
tradition
of
individual
freedom
and
equality
is
in
fact
in
process
of
destroying
the
realities
of
freedom
and
equality
out
of
which
it
rose
instead
of
the
six
hundred
thousand
families
of
the
year
all
at
about
the
same
level
of
property
and
excepting
the
peculiar
condition
of
seven
hundred
thousand
blacks
with
scarcely
anyone
in
the
position
of
a
hireling
we
have
now
as
the
most
striking
though
by
no
means
the
most
important
fact
in
american
social
life
a
frothy
confusion
of
millionaires
families
just
as
wasteful
foolish
and
vicious
as
irresponsible
human
beings
with
unlimited
resources
have
always
shown
themselves
to
be
and
concurrently
with
the
appearance
of
these
concentrations
of
great
wealth
we
have
appearing
also
poverty
poverty
of
a
degree
that
was
quite
unknown
in
the
united
states
for
the
first
century
of
their
career
as
an
independent
nation
in
the
last
few
decades
slums
as
frightful
as
any
in
europe
have
appeared
with
terrible
rapidity
and
there
has
been
a
development
of
the
viler
side
of
industrialism
of
sweating
and
base
employment
of
the
most
ominous
kind
in
robert
hunter
poverty
one
reads
of
not
less
than
eighty
thousand
children
most
of
whom
are
little
girls
at
present
employed
in
the
textile
mills
of
this
country
in
the
south
there
are
now
six
times
as
many
children
at
work
as
there
were
twenty
years
ago
child
labour
is
increasing
yearly
in
that
section
of
the
country
each
year
more
little
ones
are
brought
in
from
the
fields
and
hills
to
live
in
the
degrading
and
demoralising
atmosphere
of
the
mill
towns
children
are
deliberately
imported
by
the
italians
i
gathered
from
commissioner
watchorn
at
ellis
island
that
the
proportion
of
little
nephews
and
nieces
friends
sons
and
so
forth
brought
in
by
them
is
peculiarly
high
and
i
heard
him
try
and
condemn
a
doubtful

was
a
particularly
unattractive
italian

of
a
little
boy
of
no
ascertainable
relationship
in
the
worst

of

conditions
were
hardly
worse
than
those
now
existing
in
the
south
children
the
tiniest
and
frailest
of
five
and
six
years
of
age
rise
in
the
morning
and
like
old
men
and
women
go
to
the
mills
to
do
their
day
labour
and
when
they
return
home
wearily
fling
themselves
on
their
beds
too
tired
to
take
off
their
clothes
many
children
work
all
night
in
the
maddening
racket
of
the
machinery
in
an
atmosphere
insanitary
and
clouded
with
humidity
and
lint
it
will
be
long
adds
hunter
in
his
description
before
i
forget
the
face
of
a
little
boy
of
six
years
with
his
hands
stretched
forward
to
rearrange
a
bit
of
machinery
his
pallid
face
and
spare
form
already
showing
the
physical
effects
of
labour
this
child
six
years
of
age
was
working
twelve
hours
a
day
from
spargo
bitter
cry
of
the
children
i
learn
this
much
of
the
joys
of
certain
among
the
youth
of
pennsylvania
for
ten
or
eleven
hours
a
day
children
of
ten
and
eleven
stoop
over
the
chute
and
pick
out
the
slate
and
other
impurities
from
the
coal
as
it
moves
past
them
the
air
is
black
with
coal
dust
and
the
roar
of
the
crushers
screens
and
rushing
of
coal
is
deafening
sometimes
one
of
the
children
falls
into
the
machinery
and
is
terribly
mangled
or
slips
into
the
chute
and
is
smothered
to
death
many
children
are
killed
in
this
way
many
others
after
a
time
contract
asthma
and
consumption
which
gradually
undermine
their
health
breathing
continually

after

it
would
seem
that
at

one

and
a
half
children
are
growing
up
in
the
united

of
america
stunted
and
practically
uneducated

mentally
benighted
since
they
are
alive
and
active
since
they
are
an
active
and
positive
and
not
a
negative

are
even
more
ominous
in
the
american
outlook
than
those
five
and
sixty
million
of
good
race
and
sound
upbringing
who
will
now
never
be
born
sec
it
must
be
repeated
that
the
american
tradition
is
really
the
tradition
of
one
particular
ingredient
in
this
great
admixture
and
stirring
up
of
peoples
this
ingredient
is
the
colonial
british
whose
seventeenth
century
puritanism
and
eighteenth
century
mercantile
radicalism
and
rationalism
manifestly
furnished
all
the
stuff
out
of
which
the
american
tradition
is
made
it
is
this
stuff
planted
in
virgin
soil
and
inflated
to
an
immense
and
buoyant
optimism
by
colossal
and
unanticipated
material
prosperity
and
success
from
that
british
tradition
comes
the
individualist
protestant
spirit
the
keen
and
personal
responsibility
the
irresponsible
expenditure
the
indiscipline
and
mystical
faith
in
things
being
managed
properly
if
they
are
only
let
alone
is
the
natural
and
almost
inevitable
quality
of
a
tradition
a
class
that
has
been
forced
neither
to
rule
nor
obey
which
has
been
concentrated
and
successfully
concentrated
on
private
gain
this
british
section
of
the
american
population
was
and
is
to
this
day
the
only
really
articulate
ingredient
in
its
mental
composition
and
so
it
has
had
a
monopoly
in
providing
the
american
forms
of
thought
the
other
sections
of
peoples
that
have
been
annexed
by
or
have
come
into
this
national
synthesis
are
so
far
as
any
contribution
to
the
national
stock
of
ideas
and
ideals
is
concerned
there
are
for
example
those
great
elements
the
spanish
catholics
the
french
catholic
population
of
louisiana
the
irish
catholics
the
who
are
now
ousting
the
sterile
new
englander
from
new
england
the
germans
the
italians
the
hungarians
comparatively
they
say
nothing
from
all
the
ten
million
of
coloured

has

with
a
certain
bitterness
of
the
inaudibility
of
the
german
element
in
the
american
population
they
allow
themselves
he
remonstrates
to

for
nothing
they
did
not
seem
to
exist
he
points
out
even
in
politics
until
prohibitionist
fury
threatened
their
beer
then
indeed
the
american
german
emerged
from
silence
and
obscurity
but
only
to
rescue
his
mug
and
retire
again
with
it
into
enigmatical
silence
if
there
is
any
exception
to
this
predominance
of
the
tradition
of
the
originally
northerner
in
the
american
mind
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
spread
of
social
democracy
outward
from
the
festering
tenement
houses
of
chicago
into
the
mining
and
agrarian
regions
of
the
middle
west
it
is
a
fierce
form
of
socialist
teaching
that
speaks
throughout
these
regions
far
more
closely
akin
to
the
revolutionary
socialism
of
the
continent
of
europe
than
to
the
constructive
and
evolutionary
socialism
of
great
britain
its
typical
organ
is
appeal
to
which
circulates
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
copies
weekly
from
kansas
city
it
is
a
socialism
reeking
with
class
feeling
and
class
hatred
and
altogether
anarchistic
in
spirit
a
new
and
highly
indigestible
contribution
to
the
american
moral
and
intellectual
synthesis
it
is
remarkable
chiefly
as
the
one
shrill
exception
in
a
world
of
plastic
acceptance
now
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
this
vast
silence
of
these
imported
and
ingested
factors
that
the
american
nation
has
taken
to
itself
is
as
acquiescent
as
it
seems
no
doubt
they
are
largely
taking
over
the
traditional
forms
of
american
thought
and
expression
quietly
and
without
protest
and
wearing
them
but
they
will
wear
them
as
a
man
wears
a
misfit
shaping
and
adapting
it
every
day
more
and
more
to
his
natural
form
here
straining
a
seam
and
there
taking
in
a
looseness
a
force
of
modification
must
be
at
work
it
must
be
at
work
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
with
the
exception
of
social
democracy
it
does
not
anywhere
show
as
a
protest
or
a
fresh
beginning
or
a
challenge
to
the
prevailing
forms
how
far
it
has
actually
been
at
work
is
perhaps
to
be
judged
best
by
an
observant
stroller
surveying
the
crowds
of
a
sunday
evening
in
new
york
or
read
in
the
sheets
of
such
a
mirror
of
popular
taste
as
the
sunday
edition
of
the
york
or
the
york
in
the
former
just
what
i
mean
by
the
silent
modification
of
the
old
tradition
is
quite
typically
shown
its
leading
articles
are
written
by
arthur
brisbane
the
son
of
one
of
the
brook
farm
utopians
that
gathering
in
which
hawthorne
and
henry
james
senior
and
margaret
fuller
participated
and
in
which
the
whole
brilliant
world
of
boston
past
the
world
of
emerson
longfellow
thoreau
was
interested
brisbane
is
a
very
distinguished
man
quite
over
and
above
the
fact
that
he
is
paid
the
greatest
salary
of
any
journalist
in
the
world
he
writes
with
a
wit
and
directness
that
no
other
living
man
can
rival
and
he
holds
up
constantly
what
is
substantially
the
american
ideal
of
the
past
century
to
readers
who
evidently
need
strengthening
in
it
it
is
of
course
the
figure
of
a
man
and
not
of
a
state
it
is
a
man
clean
clean
shaved
and
almost
obtrusively
honest
muscular
alert
pushful
chivalrous
except
when
he
breaks
into
shrewd
and
penetrating
voting
you
can
fool
all
the
people
some
of
the
time
and
independent
independent
in
a
world
which
is
therefore
certain
to
give
way
to
him
his
doubts
his
questionings
his
aspirations
are
dealt
with
by
brisbane
with
a
simple
direct
fatherliness
with
all
the
beneficent
persuasiveness
of
a
revivalist
preacher
millions
read
these
leaders
and
feel
a
momentary
benefit
en
route
for
the
more
actual
portions
of
the
paper
he
asks
why
are
all
men
gamblers
he
discusses
our
longing
for
immortal
imperfection
and
did
we
once
live
on
the
moon
he
recommends
the
substitution
of
whisky
and
soda
for
neat
whisky
drawing
an
illustration
from
the
comparative
effect
of
the
diluted
and
of
the
undiluted
liquid
as
an
try
whisky
on
your
friend
eyeball
is
the
heading
sleep
the
man
who
loses
sleep
will
make
a
failure
of
his
life
or
at
least
diminish
greatly
his
chances
of
success
and
the
education
of
the
feminine
intelligence
the
cow
that
kicks
her
weaned
calf
is
all
heart
he
makes
identically
the
same
confident
appeal
to
the
moral
motive
which
was
for
so
long
the
salvation
of
the
puritan
individualism
from
which
the
american
tradition
derives
that
hand
he
writes
which
supports
the
head
of
the
baby
the
hand
supports
the
civilisation
of
the
world
but
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
saving
the
old
native
strain
in
the
population
it
moves
people
no
doubt
but
inadequately
and
here
is
a
passage
that
is
quite
the
quintessence
of
americanism
of
all
its
deep
moral
feeling
and
sentimental
untruthfulness
i
wonder
if
any
man
but
an
american
or
a
british
nonconformist
in
a
state
of
rhetorical
excitement
ever
believed
that
shakespeare
wrote
his
plays
or
michael
angelo
painted
in
a
mood
of
humanitarian
exaltation
the
good
of
all
what
we
strive
for
get
a
thousand
millions
your
day
will
come
and
in
due
course
the
graveyard
rat
will
gnaw
as
calmly
at
your
bump
of
acquisitiveness
as
at
the
mean
coat
of
the
pauper
then
shall
we
strive
for
the
names
of
the
first
great
kings
of
the
world
are
forgotten
and
the
names
of
all
those
whose
power
we
envy
will
drift
to
forgetfulness
soon
what
does
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
amount
to
standing
at
the
brink
of
niagara
with
his
solar
plexus
trembling
what
is
his
power
compared
with
the
force
of
the
wind
or
the
energy
of
one
small
wave
sweeping
along
the
shore
the
power
which
man
can
build
up
within
himself
for
himself
is
nothing
only
the
dull
reasoning
of
gratified
egotism
can
make
it
seem
worth
while
then
what
is
worth
while
let
us
look
at
some
of
the
men
who
have
come
and
gone
and
whose
lives
inspire
us
take
a
few
at
random
columbus
michael
angelo
wilberforce
shakespeare
galileo

watt
hargreaves
these
will
do
let
us
ask
ourselves
this
question
there
any
that
distinguished
their
lives
that
united
all
these
men
active
in
fields
so
different
yes
every
man
among
them
and
every
man
whose
life
history
is
worth
the
telling
did
something
for
good
of

money
if
you
can
get
power
if
you
can
then
if
you
want
to
be
more
than
the
ten
thousand
million
unknown
mingled
in
the
dust
beneath
you
see
what
good
you
can
do
with
your
money
and
your
power
if
you
are
one
of
the
many
millions
who
have
not
and
ca
get
money
or
power
see
what
good
you
can
do
without
either
you
can
help
carry
a
load
for
an
old
man
you
can
encourage
and
help
a
poor
devil
trying
to
reform
you
can
set
a
good
example
to
children
you
can
stick
to
the
men
with
whom
you
work
fighting
honestly
for
their
welfare
time
was
when
the
ablest
man
would
rather
kill
ten
men
than
feed
a
thousand
children
that
time
has
gone
we
do
not
care
much
about
feeding
the
children
but
we
care
less
about
killing
the
men
to
that
extent
we
have
improved
already
the
day
will
come
when
we
shall
prefer
helping
our
neighbour
to
robbing
him
legally
of
a
million
dollars
do
what
good
you
can
while
it
is
unusual
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
being
a
pioneer
and
an
eccentric
it
is
the
voice
of
the
american
tradition
strained
to
the
utmost
to
make
itself
audible
to
the
new
world
and
cracking
into
italics
and
breaking
into
capitals
with
the
strain
the
rest
of
that
enormous
bale
of
paper
is
eloquent
of
a
public
void
of
moral
ambitions
lost
to
any
sense
of
comprehensive
things
deaf
to
ideas
impervious
to
generalisations
a
public

has
carried
the
conception
of

to
its
logical
extreme

clientele
to
be

by
the
hundred

manifestly
with
no

just
burning

sec
the
modifications
of
the
american
tradition
that
will
occur
through
its
adoption
by
these
silent
foreign
ingredients
in
the
racial
synthesis
are
not
likely
to
add
to
it
or
elaborate
it
in
any
way
they
tend
merely
to
simplify
it
to
bare
irresponsible
individualism
it
is
with
the
detail
and
qualification
of
a
tradition
as
with
the
inflexions
of
a
language
when
another
people
takes
it
over
the
refinements
disappear
but
there
are
other
forces
of
modification
at
work
upon
the
american
tradition
of
an
altogether
more
hopeful
kind
it
has
entered
upon
a
constructive
phase
were
it
not
so
then
the
american
social
outlook
would
indeed
be
hopeless
the
effectual
modifying
force
at
work
is
not
the
strangeness
nor
the
temperamental
maladjustment
of
the
new
elements
of
population
but
the
conscious
realisation
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
tradition
on
the
part
of
the
more
intelligent
sections
of
the
american
population
that
blind
national
conceit
that
would
hear
no
criticism
and
admit
no
deficiency
has
disappeared
in
the
last
decade
such
a
change
has
come
over
the
american
mind
as
sometimes
comes
over
a
vigorous
and
wilful
child
suddenly
it
seems
to
have
grown
up
to
have
begun
to
weigh
its
powers
and
consider
its
possible
deficiencies
there
was
a
time
when
american
confidence
and
seemed
impregnable
at
the
slightest
qualm
of
doubt
america
took
to
violent
rhetoric
as
a
drunkard
resorts
to
drink
now
the
indictment
i
have
drawn
up
harshly
bluntly
and
unflatteringly
in
sec
would
receive
the
endorsement
of
american
after
american
the
falling
of
all
the
best
elements
in
the
state
the
cankering
effect
of
political
corruption
the
crumbling
of
independence
and
equality
before
the
progressive
aggregation
of
wealth
he
has
to
face
them
he
can
not
deny
them
there
has
arisen
a
new
literature
the
literature
of
national
that
seems
destined
to
modify
the
american
tradition
profoundly
to
me
it
seems
to
involve
the
hope
and
possibility
of
a
conscious
collective
organisation
of
social
life
if
ever
there
was
an
book
it
was
surely
henry
demarest
lloyd
wealth
against
commonwealth
it
marks
an
epoch
not
so
much
by
what
it
says
as
by
what
it
silently
abandons
it
was
published
in
and
it
stated
in
the
very
clearest
terms
the
incompatibility
of
the
almost
limitless
freedom
of
property
set
up
by
the
constitution
with
the
practical
freedom
and
general
happiness
of
the
mass
of
men
it
must
be
admitted
that
lloyd
never
followed
up
the
implications
of
this
repudiation
he
made
his
statements
in
the
language
of
the
tradition
he
assailed
and
foreshadowed
the
replacement
of
chaos
by
order
in
quite
chaotic
and
mystical
appeals
here
for
instance
is
a
typical
passage
from
man
the
social
creator
property
is
now
a
to
the
people
just
as
government
has
been
property
will
not
be
abolished
but
like
government
it
will
be
democratised
the
philosophy
of
as
the
social
solution
was
a
good
living
and
working
synthesis
in
the
days
when
civilisation
was
advancing
its
frontiers
twenty
miles
a
day
across
the
american
continent
and
every
man
for
himself
was
the
best
social
mobilisation
possible
but
it
is
a
belated
ghost
that
has
overstayed
the
these
were
frontier
morals
but
this
same
everyone
for
himself
becomes
most
immoral
when
the
frontier
is
abolished
and
the
pioneer
becomes
the
and
these
frontier
morals
are
most
uneconomic
when
labour
can
be
divided
and
the
product
multiplied
most
uneconomic
for
they
make
closure
the
rule
of
industry
leading
not
to
wealth
but
to
that
awful
waste
of
wealth
which
is
made
visible
to
every
eye
in
our
unemployed
not
hands
alone
but
land
machinery
and
most
of
all
hearts
those
who
still
practise
these
frontier
morals
are
like
criminals
who
according
to
the
new
science
of
penology
are
simply
reappearances
of
old
types
their
acquisitiveness
once
divine
like
mercury
is
now
out
of
place
except
in
jail
because
out
of
place
they
are
a
danger
a
sorry
day
it
is
likely
to
be
for
those
who
are
found
in
the
way
when
the
new
people
rise
to
rush
into
each
other
arms
to
get
together
to
stay
together
and
to
live
together
the
labour
movement
halts
because
so
many
of
its
rank
and
file
and
all
its
leaders
do
not
see
clearly
the
golden
thread
of
love
on
which
have
been
strung
together
all
the
past
glories
of
human
association
and
which
is
to
serve
for
the
link
of
the
new
association
of
friends
who
labour
whose
motto
is
for
all
the
establishment
of
the
intricate
commonwealth
by
a
rush
of
eighty
million
flushed
and
enthusiasts
in
fact
is
lloyd
proposal
he
will
not
face
and
few
americans
to
this
day
will
face
the
cold
need
of
a
great
science
of
social
adjustment
and
a
disciplined
and
rightly
ordered
machinery
to
turn
such
enthusiasms
to
effect
they
seem
incurably
wedded
to
gush
however
he
did
express
clearly
enough
the
opening
phase
of
american
disillusionment
with
the
wild
that
had
been
the
conception
of
life
in
america
through
a
vehement
wasteful
expanding
century
and
he
was
the
precursor
of
what
is
now
a
bulky
and
extremely
influential
literature
of
national
criticism
a
number
of
writers
literary
investigators
one
may
call
them
or
sociological
men
of
letters
or
magazine
publicists
they
are
a
little
difficult
to
place
has
taken
up
the
inquiry
into
the
condition
of
civic
administration
into
economic
organisation
into
national
politics
and
racial
interaction
with
a
frank
fearlessness
and
an
absence
of
windy
eloquence
that
has
been
to
many
europeans
a
surprising
revelation
of
the
reserve
forces
of
the
american
mind
president
roosevelt
that
magnificent
reverberator
of
ideas
that
gleam
of
wilful
humanity
that
fantastic
first
interruption
to
the
succession
of
politicians
at
the
white
house
has
echoed
clearly
to
this
movement
and
made
it
an
integral
part
of
the
general
intellectual
movement
of
america
it
is
to
these
first
intimations
of
the
need
of
a
sense
of
the
state
in
america
that
i
would
particularly
direct
the
reader
attention
in
this
discussion
they
are
the
beginnings
of
what
is
quite
conceivably
a
great
and
complex
reconstructive
effort
i
admit
they
are
but
beginnings
they
may
quite
possibly
wither
and
perish
presently
they
may
much
more
probably
be
seized
upon
by
adventurers
and
converted
into
a
new
cant
almost
as
empty
and
fruitless
as
the
old
the
fact
remains
that
through
this
busy
and
immensely
noisy
confusion
of
nearly
a
hundred
millions
of
people
these
little
voices
go
intimating
more
and
more
clearly
the
intention
to
undertake
public
affairs
in
a
new
spirit
and
upon
new
principles
to
strengthen
the
state
and
the
law
against
individual
enterprise
to
have
done
with
those
national
superstitions
under
which
hypocrisy
and
disloyalty
and
private
plunder
have
sheltered
and
prospered
for
so
long
just
as
far
as
these
reform
efforts
succeed
and
develop
is
the
organisation
of
the
united
states
of
america
into
a
great
civilised
nation
unparalleled
in
the
world
history
possible
just
as
far
as
they
fail
is
failure
written
over
the
american
future
the
real
interest
of
america
for
the
next
century
to
the
student
of
civilisation
will
be
the
development
of
these
attempts
now
in
their
infancy
to
create
and
realise
out
of
this
racial
hotchpotch
this
human
chaos
an
idea
of
the
collective
commonwealth
as
the
datum
of
reference
for
every
individual
life
sec
i
have
hinted
in
the
last
section
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
new
wave
of
constructive
ideas
in
american
thought
may
speedily
develop
a
cant
of
its
own
but
even
then
a
constructive
cant
is
better
than
a
destructive
one
even
the
conscious
hypocrite
has
to
do
something
to
justify
his
pretences
and
the
mere
disappearance
from
current
thought
of
the
persuasion
that
organisation
is
a
mistake
and
discipline
needless
clears
the
ground
of
one
huge
obstacle
even
if
it
guarantees
nothing
about
the
consequent
building
but
apart
from
this
are
there
more
solid
and
effectual
forces
behind
this
new
movement
of
ideas
that
makes
for
organisation
in
american
medley
at
the
present
time
the
speculative
writer
casting
about
for
such
elements
lights
upon
four
sets
of
possibilities
which
call
for
discussion
first
one
has
to
ask
how
far
is
the
american
plutocracy
likely
to
be
merely
a
wasteful
and
chaotic
class
and
how
far
is
it
likely
to
become
consciously
aristocratic
and
constructive
secondly
and
in
relation
to
this
what
possibilities
of
pride
and
leading
are
there
in
the
great
university
foundations
of
america
will
they
presently
begin
to
tell
as
a
restraining
and
directing
force
upon
public
thought
thirdly
will
the
growing
american
socialist
movement
which
at
present
is
just
as
anarchistic
and
undisciplined
in
spirit
as
everything
else
in
america
presently
perceive
the
constructive
implications
of
its
general
propositions
and
become
statesmanlike
and
constructive
and
fourthly
what
are
the
latent
possibilities
of
the
american
women
will
women
as
they
become
more
and
more
aware
of
themselves
as
a
class
and
of
the
problem
of
their
sex
become
a
force
upon
the
anarchistic
side
a
force
favouring
or
upon
the
constructive
side
which
plans
and
builds
and
bears
the
future
the
only
possible
answer
to
each
one
of
these
questions
at
present
is
guessing
and
an
estimate
but
the
only
way
in
which
a
conception
of
the
american
social
future
may
be
reached
lies
through
their
discussion
let
us
begin
by
considering
what
constructive
forces
may
exist
in
this
new
plutocracy
which
already
so
largely
sways
american
economic
and
political
development
the
first
impression
is
one
of
extravagant
and
aimless
expenditure
of
a
class
irresponsible
and
wasteful
beyond
all
precedent
one
gets
a
zolaesque
picture
of
that
aspect
in
upton
sinclair
metropolis
or
the
fashionable
intelligence
of
the
popular
new
york
sunday
editions
and
one
finds
a
good
deal
of
confirmatory
evidence
in
many
incidental
aspects
of
the
smart
american
life
of
paris
and
the
riviera
the
evidence
in
the
notorious
thaw
trial
after
one
has
discounted
its
theatrical
elements
was
still
a
very
convincing
demonstration
of
a
rotten
and
extravagant
because
aimless
and
functionless
class
of
rich
people
but
one
has
to
be
careful
in
this
matter
if
one
is
to
do
justice
to
the
facts
if
a
thing
is
made
up
of
two
elements
and
one
is
noisy
and
glaringly
coloured
and
the
other
is
quiet
and
colourless
the
first
impression
created
will
be
that
the
thing
is
identical
with
the
element
that
is
noisy
and
glaringly
coloured
one
is
much
less
likely
to
hear
of
the
broad
plans
and
the
quality
of
the
wise
strong
and
constructive
individuals
in
a
class
than
of
their
foolish
wives
their
spendthrift
sons
their
mistresses
and
their
moments
of
irritation
and
folly
in
the
making
of
very
rich
men
there
is
always
a
factor
of
good
fortune
and
a
factor
of
design
and
will
one
meets
rich
men
at
times
who
seem
to
be
merely
lucky
gamblers
who
strike
one
as
just
the
thousandth
man
in
a
myriad
of
wild
plungers
who
are
in
fact
chance
nobodies
washed
up
by
an
eddy
others
again
strike
one
as
exceptionally
lucky
but
there
are
others
of
a
growth
more
deliberate
and
of
an
altogether
higher
personal
quality
one
takes
such
men
as
rockefeller
or
pierpont
morgan
the
scale
of
their
fortunes
makes
them
public
property
and
it
is
clear
that
we
are
dealing
with
persons
on
quite
a
different
level
of
intellectual
power
from
the
british
colonel
norths
for
example
or
the
south
african
joels
in
my
future
in
america
i
have
taken
the
former
largely
at
miss
tarbell
estimate
and
treated
him
as
a
case
of
acquisitiveness
raised
in
baptist
surroundings
but
i
doubt
very
much
if
that
exhausts
the
man
as
he
is
given
a
man
brought
up
to
saving
and
getting
on
as
if
to
a
religion
a
man
very
acquisitive
and
very
patient
and
restrained
and
indubitably
with
great
organising
power
and
he
grows
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
and
having
done
so
there
he
is
what
is
he
going
to
do
every
step
he
takes
up
the
ascent
to
riches
gives
him
new
perspectives
and
new
points
of
view
it
may
have
appealed
to
the
young
rockefeller
clerk
in
a
chicago
house
that
to
be
rich
was
itself
a
supreme
end
in
the
first
flush
of
the
discovery
that
he
was
immensely
rich
he
may
have
thanked
heaven
as
if
for
a
supreme
good
and
spoken
to
a
sunday
school
gathering
as
if
he
knew
himself
for
the
most
favoured
of
men
but
all
that
happened
twenty
years
ago
or
more
one
does
not
keep
on
in
that
sort
of
satisfaction
one
settles
down
to
the
new
facts
and
such
men
as
rockefeller
and
pierpont
morgan
do
not
live
in
a
made
and
protected
world
with
their
minds
trained
tamed
and
fed
and
shielded
from
outside
impressions
as
royalties
do
the
thought
of
the
world
has
washed
about
them
they
have
read
and
listened
to
the
discussion
of
themselves
for
some
decades
they
have
had
sleepless
nights
of
to
succeed
in
acquiring
enormous
wealth
does
not
solve
the
problem
of
life
indeed
it
reopens
it
in
a
new
form
what
shall
i
do
with
myself
simply
recurs
again
you
may
have
decided
to
devote
yourself
to
getting
on
getting
wealthy
well
you
have
got
it
now
again
comes
the
question
what
shall
i
do
pierpont
morgan
i
am
told
collected
works
of
art
i
can
understand
that
satisfying
a
rich
gentleman
of
leisure
but
not
a
man
who
has
felt
the
sensation
of
holding
great
big
things
in
his
great
big
hands
saul
going
out
to
seek
his
father
asses
found
a
kingdom
and
became
very
spiritedly
a
king
and
it
seems
to
me
that
these
big
industrial
and
financial
organisers
whatever
in
their
youth
they
proposed
to
do
or
be
must
many
of
them
come
to
realise
that
their
organising
power
is
up
against
no
less
a
thing
than
a
nation
future
napoleon
it
is
curious
to
remember
once
wanted
to
run
a
and
a
man
may
start
to
corner
oil
and
end
the
father
of
a
civilisation
now
i
am
disposed
to
suspect
at
times
that
an
inkling
of
such
a
realisation
may
have
come
to
some
of
these
very
rich
men
i
am
inclined
to
put
it
among
the
possibilities
of
our
time
that
it
may
presently
become
clearly
and
definitely
the
inspiring
idea
of
many
of
those
who
find
themselves
predominantly
rich
i
do
not
see
why
these
active
rich
should
not
develop
statesmanship
and
i
can
quite
imagine
them
developing
very
considerable
statesmanship
because
these
men
were
able
to
realise
their
organising
power
in
the
absence
of
economic
organisation
it
does
not
follow
that
they
will
be
fanatical
for
a
continuing
looseness
and
freedom
of
property
the
phase
of
economic
liberty
ends
itself
as
marx
long
ago
pointed
out
the
american
business
world
becomes
more
and
more
a
managed
world
with
fewer
and
fewer
wild
possibilities
of
succeeding
of
all
people
the
big
millionaires
should
realise
this
most
acutely
and
in
fact
there
are
many
signs
that
they
do
it
seems
to
me
that
the
educational
zeal
of
andrew
carnegie
and
the
university
and
scientific
endowments
of
rockefeller
are
not
merely
showy
benefactions
they
express
a
definite
feeling
of
the
present
need
of
constructive
organisation
in
the
social
scheme
the
time
has
come
to
build
there
is
i
think
good
reason
for
expecting
that
statesmanship
of
the
millionaires
to
become
more
organised
and
scientific
and
comprehensive
in
the
coming
years
it
is
plausible
at
least
to
maintain
that
the
personal
quality
of
the
american
plutocracy
has
risen
in
the
last
three
decades
has
risen
from
the
quality
of
a
mere
irresponsible
wealthy
person
towards
that
of
a
real
aristocrat
with
a
sense
of
the
state
that
one
may
reckon
the
first
hopeful
possibility
in
the
american
outlook
and
intimately
connected
with
this
development
of
an
attitude
of
public
responsibility
in
the
very
rich
is
the
decay
on
the
one
hand
of
the
preposterous
idea
once
prevalent
in
america
that
politics
is
an
unsuitable
interest
for
a
gentleman
and
on
the
other
of
the
democratic
jealousy
of
any
but
poor
politicians
in
new
york
they
talk
very
much
of
gentlemen
and
by
gentlemen
they
seem
to
mean
rich
men
in
society
with
a
college
education
nowadays
gentlemen
seem
more
and
more
disposed
towards
politics
and
less
and
less
towards
a
life
of
business
or
detached
refinement
president
roosevelt
for
example
was
one
of
the
pioneers
in
this
new
development
this
restoration
of
virility
to
the
gentlemanly
ideal
his
career
marks
the
appearance
of
a
new
and
better
type
of
man
in
american
politics
the
close
of
the
rule
of
the
idealised
nobody
the
prophecy
has
been
made
at
times
that
the
united
states
might
develop
a
caesarism
and
certainly
the
position
of
president
might
easily
become
that
of
an
imperator
no
doubt
in
the
event
of
an
acute
failure
of
the
national
system
such
a
catastrophe
might
occur
but
the
more
hopeful
and
probable
line
of
development
is
one
in
which
a
conscious
and
powerful
if
informal
aristocracy
will
play
a
large
part
it
may
indeed
never
have
any
of
the
outward
forms
of
an
aristocracy
or
any
definite
public
recognition
the
americans
are
as
chary
of
the
coronet
and
the
known
aristocratic
titles
as
the
romans
were
of
the
word
king
octavius
for
that
reason
never
called
himself
king
nor
italy
a
kingdom
he
was
just
the
caesar
of
the
republic
and
the
empire
had
been
established
for
many
years
before
the
romans
fully
realised
that
they
had
returned
to
monarchy
sec
the
american
universities
are
closely
connected
in
their
development
with
the
appearance
and
growing
of
this
aristocracy
of
wealth
the
fathers
of
the
country
certainly
did
postulate
a
need
of
universities
and
in
every
state
congress
set
aside
public
lands
to
furnish
a
university
with
material
resources
every
state
possesses
a
university
though
in
many
instances
these
institutions
are
in
the
last
degree
of
feebleness
in
the
days
of
sincere
democracy
the
starvation
of
government
and
the
dislike
of
all
manifest
inequalities
involved
the
starvation
of
higher
education
moreover
the
entirely
artificial
nature
of
the
state
boundaries
representing
no
necessary
cleavages
and
traversed
haphazard
by
the
lines
of
communication
made
some
of
these
state
foundations
unnecessary
and
others
inadequate
to
a
convergent
demand
from
the
very
beginning
side
by
side
with
the
state
universities
were
the
universities
founded
by
benefactors
and
with
the
evolution
of
new
centres
of
population
new
and
extremely
generous
plutocratic
endowments
appeared
the
dominant
universities
of
america
the
treasure
houses
of
intellectual
prestige
are
almost
all
of
them
of
plutocratic
origin
and
even
in
the
state
universities
if
new
resources
are
wanted
to
found
new
chairs
to
supply
funds
for
research
or
publication
or
what
not
it
is
to
the
more
wealthy
and
not
to
the
state
legislature
that
the
appeal
is
made
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
the
common
voter
the
small
individualist
has
less
constructive
imagination
is
more
individualistic
that
is
than
the
big
individualist
this
great
network
of
universities
that
is
now
spread
over
the
states
interchanging
teachers
literature
and
ideas
and
educating
not
only
the
professions
but
a
growing
proportion
of
business
leaders
and
wealthy
people
must
necessarily
take
an
important
part
in
the
reconstruction
of
the
american
tradition
that
is
now
in
progress
it
is
giving
a
large
and
increasing
amount
of
attention
to
the
subjects
that
bear
most
directly
upon
the
peculiar
practical
problems
of
statecraft
in
america
to
psychology
sociology
and
political
science
it
is
influencing
the
press
more
and
more
directly
by
supplying
a
rising
proportion
of
journalists
and
creating
an
atmosphere
of
criticism
and
suggestion
it
is
keeping
itself
on
the
one
hand
in
touch
with
the
popular
literature
of
public
criticism
in
those
new
and
curious
organs
of
public
thought
the
magazines
and
on
the
other
it
is
making
a
constantly
more
solid
basis
of
common
understanding
upon
which
the
newer
generation
of
plutocrats
may
meet
that
older
sentimental
patriotism
must
be
giving
place
under
its
influence
to
a
more
definite
and
effectual
conception
of
a
collective
purpose
it
is
to
the
moral
and
intellectual
influence
of
sustained
scientific
study
in
the
universities
and
a
growing
increase
of
the
element
in
the
population
that
we
must
look
if
we
are
to
look
anywhere
for
the
new
progressive
methods
for
the
substitution
of
persistent
planned
and
calculated
social
development
for
the
former
conditions
of
systematic
neglect
and
corruption
in
public
affairs
varied
by
epileptic
seizures
of
reform
sec
a
third
influence
that
may
also
contribute
very
materially
to
the
reconstruction
of
the
american
tradition
is
the
socialist
movement
it
is
true
that
so
far
american
socialism
has
very
largely
taken
an
anarchistic
form
has
been
in
fact
little
more
than
a
revolutionary
movement
of
the
class
against
the
property
owner
it
has
already
been
pointed
out
that
it
derives
not
from
contemporary
english
socialism
but
from
the
marxist
social
democracy
of
the
continent
of
europe
and
has
not
even
so
much
of
the
constructive
spirit
as
has
been
developed
by
the
english
socialists
of
the
fabian
and
labour
party
group
or
by
the
newer
german
evolutionary
socialists
nevertheless
whenever
socialism
is
intelligently
met
by
discussion
or
whenever
it
draws
near
to
practicable
realisation
it
becomes
by
virtue
of
its
inherent
implications
a
constructive
force
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
will
not
be
intelligently
met
on
the
whole
and
in
the
long
run
in
america
the
alternative
to
a
developing
socialism
among
the
labouring
masses
in
america
is
that
revolutionary
anarchism
from
which
it
is
slowly
but
definitely
marking
itself
off
in
america
we
have
to
remember
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
huge
population
of
people
who
are
for
the
most
part
and
more
and
more
evidently
destined
under
the
present
system
of
free
industrial
competition
to
be
either
very
small
traders
small
farmers
on
the
verge
of
debt
or
for
all
their
lives
they
are
going
to
lead
limited
lives
and
worried
lives
and
they
know
it
nearly
everyone
can
read
and
discuss
now
the
process
of
concentrating
property
and
the
steady
fixation
of
conditions
that
were
once
fluid
and
adventurous
goes
on
in
the
daylight
visibly
to
everyone
and
it
has
to
be
borne
in
mind
also
that
these
people
are
so
far
under
the
sway
of
the
american
tradition
that
each
thinks
himself
as
good
as
any
man
and
as
much
entitled
to
the
fullness
of
life
whatever
social
tradition
their
fathers
had
whatever
ideas
of
a
place
to
be
filled
humbly
and
seriously
and
duties
to
be
done
have
been
left
behind
in
europe
no
church
dominates
the
scenery
of
this
new
land
and
offers
in
authoritative
and
convincing
tones
consolations
hereafter
for
lives
obscurely
but
faithfully
lived
whatever
else
happens
in
this
national
future
upon
one
point
the
patriotic
american
may
feel
assured
and
that
is
of
an
immense
general
discontent
in
the
working
class
and
of
a
powerful
movement
in
search
of
a
general
betterment
the
practical
forms
and
effects
of
that
movement
will
depend
almost
entirely
upon
the
average
standard
of
life
among
the
workers
and
their
general
education
sweated
and
foreigners
such
as
one
finds
in
new
jersey
living
under
conditions
of
great
misery
will
be
fierce
impatient
and
altogether
dangerous
they
will
be
acutely
exasperated
by
every
picture
of
plutocratic
luxury
in
their
newspaper
they
will
readily
resort
to
destructive
violence
the
western
miner
the
western
agriculturist
worried
beyond
endurance
between
the
and
railway
combinations
will
be
almost
equally
prone
to
savage
methods
of
expression
appeal
to
for
example
to
which
i
have
made
earlier
reference
in
this
chapter
is
furious
to
wreck
the
present
capitalistic
system
but
it
is
far
too
angry
and
impatient
for
that
satisfaction
to
produce
any
clear
suggestion
of
what
shall
replace
it
to
call
this
discontent
of
the
seething
underside
of
the
american
system
socialism
is
a
misnomer
were
there
no
socialism
there
would
be
just
as
much
of
this
discontent
just
the
same
insurgent
force
and
desire
for
violence
taking
some
other
title
and
far
more
destructive
methods
this
discontent
is
a
part
of
the
same
planless
confusion
that
gives
on
the
other
side
the
wanton
irresponsible
extravagances
of
the
smart
people
of
new
york
but
socialism
alone
of
all
the
forms
of
expression
adopted
by
the
losers
in
the
economic
struggle
contains
constructive
possibilities
and
leads
its
adherents
towards
that
ideal
of
an
organised
state
planned
and
developed
from
which
these
terrible
social
stresses
may
be
eliminated
which
is
also
the
ideal
to
which
sociology
and
the
thoughts
of
every
and
foreseeing
man
in
any
position
of
life
tend
in
the
socialist
hypothesis
of
collective
ownership
and
administration
as
the
social
basis
there
is
the
germ
of
a
sense
of
the
state
that
may
ultimately
develop
into
comprehensive
conceptions
of
social
order
conceptions
upon
which
enlightened
millionaires
and
unenlightened
workers
may
meet
at
last
in
generous
and
patriotic
the
chances
of
the
american
future
then
seem
to
range
between
two
possibilities
just
as
a
more
or
less
constructive
socialism
does
or
does
not
get
hold
of
and
inspire
the
working
mass
of
the
population
in
the
worst
event
given
an
emotional
and
empty
hostility
to
property
as
such
masquerading
as
socialism
one
has
the
prospect
of
a
bitter
and
aimless
class
war
between
the
expropriated
many
and
the
few
a
war
not
of
general
insurrection
but
of
localised
outbreaks
strikes
and
brutal
suppressions
a
war
rising
to
bloody
conflicts
and
sinking
to
coarsely
corrupt
political
contests
in
which
one
side
may
prevail
in
one
locality
and
one
in
another
and
which
may
even
develop
into
a
chronic
civil
war
in
the
parts
of
the
country
or
an
irresistible
movement
for
secession
between
west
and
east
that
is
assuming
the
greatest
imaginable
vehemence
and
selfishness
and
the
least
imaginable
intelligence
on
the
part
of
both
workers
and
the
government
but
if
the
more
powerful
and
educated
sections
of
the
american
community
realise
in
time
the
immense
moral
possibilities
of
the
socialist
movement
if
they
will
trouble
to
understand
its
good
side
instead
of
emphasising
its
bad
if
they
will
keep
in
touch
with
it
and
help
in
the
development
of
a
constructive
content
to
its
propositions
then
it
seems
to
me
that
popular
socialism
may
count
as
a
third
great
factor
in
the
making
of
the
civilised
american
state
in
any
case
it
does
not
seem
to
me
probable
that
there
can
be
any
national
revolutionary
movement
or
any
complete
arrest
in
the
development
of
an
aristocratic
phase
in
american
history
the
area
of
the
country
is
too
great
and
the
means
of
communication
between
the
workers
in
different
parts
inadequate
for
a
concerted
rising
or
even
for
effective
political
action
in
mass
in
the
worst
event
and
it
is
only
in
the
worst
event
that
a
great
insurrectionary
movement
becomes
probable
the
newspapers
magazines
telephones
and
telegraphs
all
the
apparatus
of
discussion
and
popular
appeal
the
railways
arsenals
guns
flying
machines
and
all
the
material
of
warfare
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
property
owners
and
the
average
of
betrayal
among
the
leaders
of
a
class
not
racially
homogeneous
embittered
suspicious
united
only
by
their
discomforts
and
not
by
any
constructive
intentions
will
necessarily
be
high
so
that
though
the
intensifying
trouble
between
labour
and
capital
may
mean
immense
social
disorganisation
and
lawlessness
though
it
may
even
supply
the
popular
support
in
new
attempts
at
secession
i
do
not
see
in
it
the
possibility
and
force
for
that
new
start
which
the
revolutionary
socialists
anticipate
i
see
it
merely
as
one
of
several
forces
making
on
the
whole
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
possible
mediatory
action
of
the
universities
for
construction
and
reconciliation
sec
what
changes
are
likely
to
occur
in
the
more
intimate
social
life
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
two
influences
are
at
work
that
may
modify
this
profoundly
one
is
that
spread
of
knowledge
and
that
accompanying
change
in
moral
attitude
which
is
more
and
more
sterilising
the
once
prolific
american
home
and
the
second
is
the
rising
standard
of
feminine
education
there
has
arisen
in
this
age
a
new
consciousness
in
women
they
are
entering
into
the
collective
thought
to
a
degree
unprecedented
in
the
world
history
and
with
portents
at
once
disquieting
and
confused
in
sec
i
enumerated
what
i
called
the
silent
factors
in
the
american
synthesis
the
immigrant
european
aliens
the
catholics
the
coloured
blood
and
so
forth
i
would
now
observe
that
in
the
making
of
the
american
tradition
the
women
also
have
been
to
a
large
extent
and
quite
remarkably
a
silent
factor
that
tradition
is
not
only
fundamentally
and
english
but
it
is
also
fundamentally
masculine
the
citizen
is
the
man
the
woman
belongs
to
him
he
votes
for
her
works
for
her
does
all
the
severer
thinking
for
her
she
is
in
the
home
behind
the
shop
or
in
the
dairy
at
the
farmhouse
with
her
daughters
she
gets
the
meal
while
the
men
talk
the
american
imagination
and
american
feeling
centre
largely
upon
the
family
and
upon
mother
american
ideals
are
homely
the
social
unit
is
the
home
and
it
is
another
and
a
different
set
of
influences
and
considerations
that
are
never
thought
of
at
all
when
the
home
sentiment
is
under
discussion
that
indeed
it
would
be
indelicate
to
mention
at
such
a
time
which
are
making
that
social
unit
the
home
of
one
child
or
of
no
children
at
all
that
ideal
of
a
home
has
been
the
prevalent
american
ideal
from
the
landing
of
the
right
down
to
the
leader
writing
of
arthur
brisbane
and
it
is
clear
that
a
very
considerable
section
among
one
educated
women
contemporaries
do
not
mean
to
stand
this
ideal
any
longer
they
do
not
want
to
be
owned
and
cherished
and
they
do
not
want
to
be
revered
how
far
they
represent
their
sex
in
this
matter
it
is
very
hard
to
say
in
england
in
the
professional
and
most
intellectually
active
classes
it
is
scarcely
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
most
able
women
below
are
workers
for
the
suffrage
and
the
ideal
of
equal
and
independent
citizenship
and
active
critics
of
the
conventions
under
which
women
live
it
is
at
least
plausible
to
suppose
that
a
day
is
approaching
when
the
alternatives
between
celibacy
or
a
life
of
economic
dependence
and
physical
subordination
to
a
man
who
has
chosen
her
and
upon
whose
kindness
her
happiness
depends
or
prostitution
will
no
longer
be
a
satisfactory
outlook
for
the
great
majority
of
women
and
when
with
a
newly
aroused
political
consciousness
they
will
be
prepared
to
exert
themselves
as
a
class
to
modify
this
situation
it
may
be
that
this
is
incorrect
and
that
in
devotion
to
an
accepted
male
and
his
children
most
women
do
still
and
will
continue
to
find
their
greatest
satisfaction
in
life
but
it
is
the
writer
impression
that
so
simple
and
a
devotion
is
rare
and
that
released
from
tradition
and
education
reading
and
discussion
do
mean
release
from
tradition
women
are
as
eager
for
initiative
freedom
and
experience
as
men
in
that
case
they
will
persist
in
the
present
agitation
for
political
rights
and
these
secured
go
on
to
demand
a
very
considerable
reconstruction
of
our
present
social
order
it
is
interesting
to
point
the
direction
in
which
this
desire
for
independence
will
probably
take
them
they
will
discover
that
the
dependence
of
women
at
the
present
time
is
not
so
much
a
as
an
economic
dependence
due
to
the
economic
disadvantages
their
sex
imposes
upon
them
maternity
and
the
concomitants
of
maternity
are
the
circumstances
in
their
lives
exhausting
energy
and
earning
nothing
that
place
them
at
a
discount
from
the
stage
when
property
ceased
to
be
chiefly
the
creation
of
feminine
agricultural
toil
the
primitive
matriarchate
to
our
present
stage
women
have
had
to
depend
upon
a
man
willingness
to
keep
them
in
order
to
realise
the
organic
purpose
of
their
being
whether
conventionally
equal
or
not
whether
voters
or
not
that
necessity
for
dependence
will
still
remain
under
our
system
of
private
property
and
free
independent
competition
there
is
only
one
evident
way
by
which
women
as
a
class
can
escape
from
that
dependence
each
upon
an
individual
man
and
from
all
the
practical
inferiority
this
dependence
entails
and
that
is
by
so
altering
their
status
as
to
make
maternity
and
the
upbringing
of
children
a
charge
not
upon
the
husband
of
the
mother
but
upon
the
community
the
public
endowment
of
maternity
is
the
only
route
by
which
the
mass
of
women
can
reach
that
personal
freedom
and
independent
citizenship
so
many
of
them
desire
now
this
idea
of
the
endowment
of
maternity
or
as
it
is
frequently
phrased
the
endowment
of
the
home
is
at
present
put
forward
by
the
modern
socialists
as
an
integral
part
of
their
proposals
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
there
is
this
convergent
possibility
which
may
bring
the
feminist
movement
at
last
altogether
into
line
with
constructive
socialism
obviously
before
anything
in
the
direction
of
family
endowment
becomes
practicable
public
bodies
and
the
state
organisation
will
need
to
display
far
more
integrity
and
efficiency
than
they
do
in
america
at
the
present
time
still
that
is
the
trend
of
things
in
all
contemporary
civilised
communities
and
it
is
a
trend
that
will
find
a
powerful
reinforcement
in
men
solicitudes
as
the
increasing
failure
of
the
unsupported
private
family
to
produce
offspring
adequate
to
the
needs
of
social
development
becomes
more
and
more
conspicuous
the
impassioned
appeals
of
president
roosevelt
have
already
brought
home
the
of
the
to
every
american
intelligence
but
mere
rhetoric
will
not
in
itself
suffice
to
make
people
insecurely
employed
and
struggling
to
maintain
a
comfortable
standard
of
life
against
great
economic
pressure
prolific
presented
as
a
call
to
a
particularly
onerous
and
quite
unpaid
social
duty
the
appeal
for
unrestricted
parentage
fails
husband
and
wife
alike
dread
an
excessive
burthen
travel
leisure
freedom
comfort
property
and
increased
ability
for
business
competition
are
the
rewards
of
abstinence
from
parentage
and
even
the
disapproval
of
president
roosevelt
and
the
pride
of
offspring
are
insufficient
counterweights
to
these
inducements
large
families
disappear
from
the
states
and
more
and
more
couples
are
childless
those
who
have
children
restrict
their
number
in
order
to
afford
those
they
have
some
reasonable
advantage
in
life
this
in
the
presence
of
the
necessary
knowledge
is
as
practically
inevitable
a
consequence
of
individualist
competition
and
the
old
american
tradition
as
the
appearance
of
slums
and
a
class
of
millionaires
these
facts
go
to
the
very
root
of
the
american
problem
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
in
spite
of
a
colossal
immigration
the
population
of
the
united
states
was
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
over
twenty
millions
short
of
what
it
should
have
been
through
its
own
native
increase
had
the
of
the
opening
of
the
century
been
maintained
for
a
hundred
years
america
has
been
fed
by
europe
that
feeding
process
will
not
go
on
indefinitely
the
immigration
came
in
waves
as
if
reservoir
after
reservoir
was
tapped
and
exhausted
nowadays
england
scotland
ireland
france
and
scandinavia
send
hardly
any
more
they
have
no
more
to
send
germany
and
switzerland
send
only
a
few
the
south
european
and
austrian
supply
is
not
as
abundant
as
it
was
there
may
come
a
time
when
europe
and
western
asia
will
have
no
more
surplus
population
to
send
when
even
eastern
asia
will
have
passed
into
a
less
fecund
phase
and
when
america
will
have
to
look
to
its
own
natural
increase
for
the
continued
development
of
its
resources
if
the
present
isolated
family
of
private
competition
is
still
the
social
unit
it
seems
improbable
that
there
will
be
any
greater
natural
increase
than
there
is
in
france
will
the
growing
idea
of
a
closer
social
organisation
have
developed
by
that
time
to
the
possibility
of
some
collective
effort
in
this
matter
or
will
that
only
come
about
after
the
population
of
the
world
has
passed
through
a
phase
of
absolute
recession
the
peculiar
constitution
of
the
united
states
gives
a
remarkable
freedom
of
experiment
in
these
matters
to
each
individual
state
and
local
developments
do
not
need
to
wait
upon
a
national
change
of
opinion
but
on
the
other
hand
the
superficial
impression
of
an
english
visitor
is
that
any
such
profound
interference
with
domestic
autonomy
runs
counter
to
all
that
americans
seem
to
hold
dear
at
the
present
time
these
are
however
new
ideas
and
new
considerations
that
have
still
to
be
brought
adequately
before
the
national
consciousness
and
it
is
quite
impossible
to
calculate
how
a
population
living
under
changing
conditions
and
with
a
rising
standard
of
education
and
a
developing
feminine
consciousness
may
not
think
and
feel
and
behave
in
a
generation
time
at
present
for
all
political
and
collective
action
america
is
a
democracy
of
untutored
individualist
men
who
will
neither
tolerate
such
interference
between
themselves
and
the
women
they
choose
to
marry
as
the
endowment
of
motherhood
implies
nor
view
the
kids
who
will
at
times
occur
even
in
the
families
as
anything
but
rather
embarrassing
rather
amusing
of
the
individual
affections
i
find
in
the
london
for
august
a
description
by
jerome
jerome
of
john
smith
the
average
british
voter
john
smith
might
serve
in
some
respects
for
the
common
man
of
all
the
modern
civilisations
among
other
things
that
john
smith
thinks
and
wants
he
wants
a
little
house
and
garden
in
the
country
all
to
himself
his
idea
is
somewhere
near
half
an
acre
of
ground
he
would
like
a
piano
in
the
best
room
it
has
always
been
his
dream
to
have
a
piano
the
youngest
girl
he
is
convinced
is
musical
as
a
man
who
has
knocked
about
the
world
and
has
thought
he
quite
appreciates
the
argument
that
by
the
material
side
of
life
can
be
greatly
improved
he
quite
sees
that
by
combining
a
dozen
families
together
in
one
large
house
better
practical
results
can
be
obtained
it
is
as
easy
to
direct
the
cooking
for
a
hundred
as
for
half
a
dozen
there
would
be
less
waste
of
food
of
coals
of
lighting
to
put
aside
one
piano
for
one
girl
is
absurd
he
sees
all
this
but
it
does
not
alter
one
little
bit
his
passionate
craving
for
that
small
house
and
garden
all
to
himself
he
is
built
that
way
he
is
typical
of
a
good
many
other
men
and
women
built
on
the
same
pattern
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
change
them
their
instincts
their
very
nature
rooted
in
the
centuries
or
as
an
alternative
vary
socialism
to
fit
john
smith
which
is
likely
to
prove
the
shorter
operation
that
however
is
by
the
way
here
is
the
point
at
issue
he
has
heard
that
socialism
proposes
to
acknowledge
woman
service
to
the
state
by
paying
her
a
weekly
wage
according
to
the
number
of
children
that
she
bears
and
rears
i
do
propose
to
repeat
his
objections
to
the
idea
they
could
hardly
be
called
objections
there
is
an
ugly
look
comes
into
his
eyes
something
quite
undefinable
prehistoric
almost
dangerous
looks
out
of
them
in
talking
to
him
on
this
subject
you
do
not
seem
to
be
talking
to
a
man
it
is
as
if
you
had
come
face
to
face
with
something
behind
civilisation
behind
humanity
something
deeper
down
still
among
the
dim
beginnings
of
creation
now
no
doubt
jerome
is
writing
with
emphasis
here
but
there
is
sufficient
truth
in
the
passage
for
it
to
stand
here
as
a
rough
symbol
of
another
factor
in
this
question
john
smithism
that
manly
and
individualist
element
in
the
citizen
stands
over
against
and
resists
all
the
forces
of
organisation
that
would
subjugate
it
to
a
collective
purpose
it
is
careless
of
coming
national
cessation
and
depopulation
careless
of
the
insurgent
spirit
beneath
the
acquiescences
of
smith
careless
of
its
own
inevitable
defeat
in
the
economic
struggle
careless
because
it
can
understand
none
of
these
things
it
is
obstinately
asserting
what
it
conceives
to
be
itself
against
the
universe
and
all
other
john
smiths
whatsoever
it
is
a
factor
with
all
other
factors
the
creative
acquisitive
aggressive
spirit
of
those
bigger
john
smiths
who
succeed
as
against
the
myriads
of
john
smiths
who
fail
the
wider
horizons
and
more
efficient
methods
of
the
educated
man
the
awakening
of
women
the
inevitable
futility
of
john
smithism
the
sturdy
independence
that
makes
john
smith
resent
even
disciplined
with
tom
brown
to
achieve
a
common
end
his
essential
incapacity
indeed
for
collective
action
all
these
things
are
against
the
ultimate
triumph
and
make
for
the
ultimate
civilisation
even
of
john
smith
sec
it
may
be
doubted
if
the
increasing
collective
organisation
of
society
to
which
the
united
states
of
america
in
common
with
all
the
rest
of
the
world
seem
to
be
tending
will
be
to
any
very
large
extent
a
national
organisation
the
constitution
is
an
immense
and
complicated
barrier
to
effectual
centralisation
there
are
many
reasons
for
supposing
the
national
government
will
always
remain
a
little
ineffectual
and
detached
from
the
full
flow
of
american
life
and
this
notwithstanding
the
very
great
powers
with
which
the
president
is
endowed
one
of
these
reasons
is
certainly
the
peculiar
accident
that
has
placed
the
seat
of
government
upon
the
potomac
to
the
thoughtful
visitor
to
the
united
states
this
hiding
away
of
the
central
government
in
a
minute
district
remote
from
all
the
great
centres
of
thought
population
and
business
activity
becomes
more
remarkable
more
perplexing
more
suggestive
of
an
incurable
weakness
in
the
national
government
as
he
grasps
more
firmly
the
peculiarities
of
the
american
situation
i
do
not
see
how
the
central
government
of
that
great
american
nation
of
which
i
dream
can
possibly
be
at
washington
and
i
do
not
see
how
the
present
central
government
can
possibly
be
transferred
to
any
other
centre
but
to
go
to
washington
to
see
and
talk
to
washington
is
to
receive
an
extraordinary
impression
of
the
utter
isolation
and
hopelessness
of
washington
the
national
government
has
an
air
of
being
marooned
there
or
as
though
it
had
crept
into
a
corner
to
do
something
in
the
dark
one
goes
from
the
abounding
movement
and
vitality
of
the
northern
cities
to
this
sunny
and
enervating
place
through
the
negligently
cultivated
country
of
virginia
and
one
discovers
the
slovenly
unfinished
promise
of
a
city
broad
avenues
lined
by
negro
shanties
and
patches
of
cultivation
great
public
buildings
and
an
immense
post
office
a
lifeless
museum
an
inert
university
a
splendid
desert
library
a
street
of
souvenir
shops
a
certain
industry
of
seeing
washington
an
idiotic
colossal
obelisk
it
seems
an
ideal
nest
for
the
tariff
manipulator
a
festering
corner
of
delegates
and
agents
and
secondary
people
in
the
white
house
in
the
time
of
president
roosevelt
the
present
writer
found
a
transitory
glow
of
intellectual
activity
the
spittoons
and
glass
screens
that
once
made
it
like
a
london
gin
palace
had
been
removed
and
the
former
orgies
of
handshaking
reduced
to
a
minimum
it
was
one
felt
an
accidental
phase
the
assassination
of
mckinley
was
an
interruption
of
the
normal
washington
process
to
this
place
out
of
the
way
of
everywhere
come
the
senators
and
congressmen
mostly
leaving
their
families
behind
them
in
their
states
of
origin
and
hither
too
are
drawn
a
multitude
of
journalists
and
political
agents
and
clerks
a
crowd
of
underbred
mediocre
men
for
most
of
them
there
is
neither
social
nor
intellectual
life
the
thought
of
america
is
far
away
centred
now
in
new
york
the
business
and
economic
development
centres
upon
new
york
apart
from
the
president
it
is
in
new
york
that
one
meets
the
people
who
matter
and
the
new
york
atmosphere
that
grows
and
develops
ideas
and
purposes
new
york
is
the
natural
capital
of
the
united
states
and
would
need
to
be
the
capital
of
any
highly
organised
national
system
government
from
the
district
of
columbia
is
in
itself
the
repudiation
of
any
highly
organised
national
system
but
government
from
this
ineffectual
inert
place
is
only
the
most
striking
outcome
of
that
inflexible
constitution
the
wrangling
delegates
of
did
at
last
produce
out
of
a
conflict
of
state
jealousies
they
did
their
best
to
render
centralisation
or
any
coalescence
of
states
impossible
and
private
property
impregnable
and
so
far
their
work
has
proved
extraordinarily
effective
only
a
great
access
of
intellectual
and
moral
vigour
in
the
nation
can
ever
set
it
aside
and
while
the
more
and
more
sterile
millions
of
the
united
states
grapple
with
the
legal
and
traditional
difficulties
that
promise
at
last
to
arrest
their
development
altogether
the
rest
of
the
world
will
be
moving
on
to
new
phases
an
awakened
asia
will
be
reorganising
its
social
and
political
conceptions
in
the
light
of
modern
knowledge
and
modern
ideas
and
south
america
will
be
working
out
its
destinies
perhaps
in
the
form
of
a
powerful
confederation
of
states
all
europe
will
be
schooling
its
john
smiths
to
finer
discipline
and
broader
ideas
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
american
john
smiths
may
have
little
to
brag
about
in
the
way
of
national
predominance
by
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
united
states
may
be
sitting
meekly
at
the
feet
of
at
present
unanticipated
teachers
the
possible
collapse
of
civilisation
year
the
editor
of
the
york
has
asked
me
to
guess
the
general
trend
of
events
in
the
next
thirty
years
or
so
with
especial
reference
to
the
outlook
for
the
state
and
city
of
new
york
i
like
and
rarely
refuse
such
cheerful
invitations
to
prophesy
i
have
already
made
a
sort
of
forecast
in
my
anticipations
of
what
may
happen
if
the
social
and
economic
process
goes
on
fairly
smoothly
for
all
that
time
and
shown
a
new
york
relieved
from
its
present
congestion
by
the
development
of
the
means
of
communication
and
growing
and
spreading
in
wide
and
splendid
suburbs
towards
boston
and
philadelphia
i
made
that
forecast
before
ever
i
passed
sandy
hook
but
my
recent
visit
only
enhanced
my
sense
of
growth
and
go
in
things
american
still
we
are
nowadays
all
too
apt
to
think
that
growth
is
inevitable
and
progress
in
the
nature
of
things
the
wonderful
century
as
alfred
russel
wallace
called
the
nineteenth
has
made
us
perhaps
and
forgetful
of
the
ruins
of
great
cities
and
confident
prides
of
the
past
that
litter
the
world
and
here
i
will
write
about
the
other
alternative
of
the
progressive
process
hitting
something
and
smashing
there
are
two
chief
things
in
modern
life
that
impress
me
as
dangerous
and
incalculable
the
first
of
these
is
the
modern
currency
and
financial
system
and
the
second
is
the
chance
we
take
of
destructive
war
let
me
dwell
first
of
all
on
the
mysterious
possibilities
of
the
former
and
then
point
out
one
or
two
uneasy
developments
of
the
latter
now
there
is
nothing
scientific
about
our
currency
and
finance
at
all
it
is
a
thing
that
has
grown
up
and
elaborated
itself
out
of
very
simple
beginnings
in
the
course
of
a
century
or
so
three
hundred
years
ago
the
edifice
had
hardly
begun
to
rise
from
the
ground
most
property
was
real
most
people
lived
directly
on
the
land
most
business
was
on
a
cash
basis
oversea
trade
was
a
proportionately
small
affair
labour
was
locally
fixed
most
of
the
world
was
at
the
level
at
which
much
of
china
remains
able
to
get
along
without
even
coinage
it
was
a
rudimentary
world
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
modern
financier
and
industrial
organiser
well
on
that
rude
secure
basis
there
has
now
been
piled
the
most
chancy
and
insecurely
experimental
system
of
conventions
and
assumptions
about
money
and
credit
it
is
possible
to
imagine
there
has
grown
up
a
vast
system
of
lending
and
borrowing
a
extension
of
enterprises
that
involve
at
last
the
most
fantastic
relationships
i
find
myself
for
example
owning
partially
at
least
a
bank
in
new
zealand
a
railway
in
cuba
another
in
canada
several
in
brazil
an
electric
power
plant
in
the
city
of
westminster
and
so
on
and
i
use
these
stocks
and
shares
as
a
sort
of
money
if
i
want
money
to
spend
i
sell
a
railway
share
much
as
one
might
change
a
banknote
if
i
have
more
cash
than
i
need
immediately
i
buy
a
few
shares
i
perceive
that
the
value
of
these
shares
oscillates
sometimes
rather
gravely
and
that
the
value
of
the
alleged
money
on
the
cheques
i
get
also
oscillates
as
compared
with
the
things
i
want
to
buy
that
indeed
the
whole
system
which
has
only
existed
for
a
couple
of
centuries
or
so
and
which
keeps
on
getting
higher
and
giddier
is
perpetually
swaying
and
quivering
and
bending
and
sagging
but
it
is
only
when
such
a
great
crisis
occurs
as
that
of
that
it
enters
my
mind
that
possibly
there
is
no
limit
to
these
oscillations
that
possibly
the
whole
vast
accidental
edifice
will
presently
come
smashing
down
why
should
it
i
defy
any
economist
or
financial
expert
to
prove
that
it
can
not
that
it
has
done
so
in
the
little
time
for
which
it
has
existed
is
no
reply
at
all
it
is
like
arguing
that
a
man
can
not
die
because
he
has
never
been
known
to
do
so
previous
men
have
died
previous
civilisations
have
collapsed
if
not
of
acute
then
of
chronic
financial
disorders
the
experience
of
indicated
very
clearly
how
a
collapse
might
occur
a
panic
like
an
avalanche
is
a
thing
much
easier
to
start
than
stop
previous
panics
have
been
arrested
by
good
luck
this
last
one
in
america
for
example
found
europe
strong
and
prosperous
and
helpful
in
every
panic
period
there
is
a
huge
dislocation
of
business
enterprises
vast
multitudes
of
men
are
thrown
out
of
employment
there
is
grave
social
and
political
disorder
but
in
the
end
so
far
things
have
an
air
of
having
recovered
but
now
suppose
the
panic
wave
a
little
more
universal
and
panic
waves
tend
to
be
more
extensive
than
they
used
to
be
suppose
that
when
securities
fall
all
round
and
gold
appreciates
in
new
york
and
frightened
people
begin
to
sell
investments
and
hoard
gold
the
same
thing
happens
in
other
parts
of
the
world
increase
the
scale
of
the
trouble
only
two
or
three
times
and
would
our
system
recover
imagine
great
masses
of
men
coming
out
of
employment
and
angry
and
savage
in
all
our
great
towns
imagine
the
railways
working
with
reduced
staffs
on
reduced
salaries
or
blocked
by
strikers
imagine
provision
dealers
stopping
consignments
to
retailers
and
retailers
hesitating
to
give
credit
a
phase
would
arrive
when
the
police
and
militia
keeping
order
in
the
streets
would
find
themselves
on
short
rations
and
without
their
weekly
pay
what
we
moderns
with
our
little
three
hundred
years
or
so
of
security
do
not
recognise
is
that
things
that
go
up
and
down
may
given
a
certain
combination
of
chances
go
down
steadily
down
and
down
what
would
you
do
dear
reader
what
should
i
do
if
a
slump
went
on
continually
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
great
danger
to
our
modern
civilisation
and
that
is
war
we
have
war
while
we
have
left
our
peace
organisation
to
the
niggling
slow
methods
of
private
enterprise
while
we
have
left
the
breeding
of
our
peoples
to
chance
their
minds
to
the
halfpenny
press
and
their
wealth
to
the
drug
manufacturer
we
have
pushed
forward
the
art
of
war
on
severely
scientific
and
socialist
lines
we
have
put
all
the
collective
resources
of
the
community
and
an
enormous
proportion
of
its
intelligence
and
invention
ungrudgingly
into
the
improvement
and
manufacture
of
the
apparatus
of
destruction
great
britain
for
example
is
content
with
the
railways
and
fireplaces
and
types
of
housing
she
had
fifty
years
ago
she
still
uses
telephones
and
the
electric
light
in
the
most
tentative
spirit
but
every
ironclad
she
had
years
ago
is
old
iron
now
and
abandoned
everything
crawls
forward
but
the
science
of
war
that
rushes
on
of
what
will
happen
if
presently
the
guns
begin
to
go
off
i
have
no
shadow
of
doubt
every
year
has
seen
the
disproportionate
increase
until
now
every
modern
european
state
is
more
or
less
like
a
cranky
steamboat
in
which
some
idiot
has
mounted
and
loaded
a
monstrous
gun
with
no
apparatus
to
damp
its
recoil
whether
that
gun
hits
or
misses
when
it
is
fired
of
one
thing
we
may
be
absolutely
certain
it
will
send
the
steamboat
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
modern
warfare
is
an
insanity
not
a
sane
business
proposition
its
preparation
eats
more
and
more
into
the
resources
which
should
be
furnishing
a
developing
civilisation
its
possibilities
of
destruction
are
incalculable
a
new
epoch
has
opened
with
the
coming
of
the
navigable
balloon
and
the
flying
machine
to
begin
with
these
things
open
new
gulfs
for
expenditure
in
the
end
they
mean
possibilities
of
destruction
beyond
all
precedent
such
things
as
the
and
the
de
are
only
the
first
pigmy
essays
of
the
aeronaut
it
is
clear
that
to
be
effective
capable
of
carrying
guns
and
comparatively
insensitive
to
perforation
by
shot
and
shell
these
things
will
have
to
be
very
much
larger
and
as
costly
perhaps
as
a
cruiser
imagine
such
monsters
of
the
air
and
wild
financial
panic
below
here
then
are
two
associated
possibilities
with
which
to
modify
our
expectation
of
an
america
advancing
steadily
on
the
road
to
an
organised
civilisation
of
new
york
rebuilding
herself
in
marble
spreading
like
a
garden
city
over
new
jersey
and
long
island
and
new
york
state
becoming
a
new
and
greater
venice
queen
of
the
earth
perhaps
after
all
the
twentieth
century
is
going
to
be
so
prosperous
as
the
nineteenth
perhaps
instead
of
going
resistlessly
onward
we
are
going
to
have
a
perhaps
we
are
going
to
be
put
back
to
learn
over
again
under
simpler
conditions
some
of
those
necessary
fundamental
lessons
our
race
has
learnt
as
yet
insufficiently
well
honesty
and
brotherhood
social
collectivism
and
the
need
of
some
common
council
for
the
whole
world
the
ideal
citizen
our
conceptions
of
what
a
good
citizen
should
be
are
all
at
sixes
and
sevens
no
two
people
will
be
found
to
agree
in
every
particular
of
such
an
ideal
and
the
extreme
divergences
upon
what
is
necessary
what
is
permissible
what
is
unforgivable
in
him
will
span
nearly
the
whole
range
of
human
possibility
and
conduct
as
a
consequence
we
bring
up
our
children
in
a
mist
of
vague
intimations
in
a
confusion
of
warring
voices
perplexed
as
to
what
they
must
do
uncertain
as
to
what
they
may
do
doomed
to
lives
of
compromise
and
fluctuating
and
inoperative
opinion
ideals
and
suggestions
come
and
go
before
their
eyes
like
figures
in
a
fog
the
commonest
pattern
perhaps
the
commonest
pattern
certainly
in
sunday
schools
and
edifying
books
and
on
all
those
places
and
occasions
when
morality
is
sought
as
an
end
is
a
clean
and
person
truthful
to
the
extent
that
he
does
not
tell
lies
temperate
so
far
as
abstinence
is
concerned
honest
without
pedantry
and
active
in
his
own
affairs
steadfastly
and
respectful
to
custom
and
usage
though
aloof
from
the
tumult
of
politics
brave
but
not
adventurous
punctual
in
some
form
of
religious
exercise
devoted
to
his
wife
and
children
and
kind
without
extravagance
to
all
men
everyone
feels
that
this
is
not
enough
everyone
feels
that
something
more
is
wanted
and
something
different
most
people
are
a
little
interested
in
what
that
difference
can
be
and
it
is
a
business
that
much
of
what
is
more
than
trivial
in
our
art
our
literature
and
our
drama
must
do
to
fill
in
bit
by
bit
and
shade
by
shade
the
subtle
the
permanent
detail
of
the
answer
it
does
very
greatly
help
in
this
question
to
bear
in
mind
the
conflict
of
our
origins
every
age
is
an
age
of
transition
of
minglings
of
the
breaking
up
of
old
narrow
cultures
and
the
breaking
down
of
barriers
of
spiritual
and
often
of
actual
interbreeding
not
only
is
the
physical
but
the
moral
and
intellectual
ancestry
of
everyone
more
mixed
than
ever
it
was
before
we
blend
in
our
blood
everyone
of
us
and
we
blend
in
our
ideas
and
purposes
craftsmen
warriors
savages
peasants
and
a
score
of
races
and
an
endless
multitude
of
social
expedients
and
rules
go
back
but
a
hundred
generations
in
the
lineage
of
the
most
delicate
girl
you
know
and
you
will
find
a
dozen
murderers
you
will
find
liars
and
cheats
lascivious
sinners
women
who
have
sold
themselves
slaves
imbeciles
devotees
saints
men
of
fantastic
courage
discreet
and
watchful
persons
usurers
savages
criminals
and
kings
and
every
one
of
this
miscellany
not
simply
fathering
or
mothering
on
the
way
to
her
but
teaching
urgently
and
with
every
grade
of
intensity
views
and
habits
for
which
they
stand
something
of
it
all
has
come
to
her
albeit
much
may
seem
forgotten
in
every
human
birth
with
a
new
little
variation
a
fresh
slight
novelty
of
arrangement
the
old
issues
rise
again
our
ideas
even
more
than
our
blood
flow
from
multitudinous
sources
certain
groups
of
ideas
come
to
us
distinctively
associated
with
certain
marked
ways
of
life
many
and
for
a
majority
of
us
it
may
be
most
of
our
ancestors
were
serfs
or
slaves
and
men
and
women
who
have
had
generation
after
generation
to
adapt
themselves
to
slavery
and
the
rule
of
a
master
develop
an
idea
of
goodness
very
different
from
that
of
princes
from
our
slave
ancestry
says
lester
ward
we
learnt
to
work
and
certainly
it
is
from
slavery
we
derive
the
conception
that
industry
even
though
it
be
purposeless
industry
is
a
virtue
in
itself
the
good
slave
too
has
a
morality
of
restraints
he
abstains
from
the
food
he
handles
and
hungers
for
and
he
denies
himself
pride
and
initiative
of
every
sort
he
is
honest
in
not
taking
but
he
is
unscrupulous
about
adequate
service
he
makes
no
virtue
of
frankness
but
much
of
kindly
helpfulness
and
charity
to
the
weak
he
has
no
sense
of
duty
in
planning
or
economising
he
is
polite
and
and
disposed
to
irony
rather
than
denunciation
ready
to
admire
cuteness
and
condone
deception
not
so
the
rebel
that
tradition
is
working
in
us
also
it
has
been
the
lot
of
vast
masses
of
population
in
every
age
to
be
living
in
successful
or
unsuccessful
resistance
to
mastery
to
be
dreading
oppression
or
to
be
just
escaped
from
it
resentment
becomes
a
virtue
then
and
any
peace
with
the
oppressor
a
crime
it
is
from
rebel
origins
so
many
of
us
get
the
idea
that
disrespectfulness
is
something
of
a
duty
and
obstinacy
a
fine
thing
and
under
the
force
of
this
tradition
we
idealise
the
rugged
and
unmanageable
we
find
something
heroic
in
rough
clothes
and
hands
in
bad
manners
insensitive
behaviour
and
unsociableness
and
a
community
of
settlers
again
in
a
rough
country
fighting
for
a
bare
existence
makes
a
virtue
of
vehemence
of
a
hasty
rapidity
of
execution
hurried
and
driven
men
glorify
push
and
impatience
and
despise
finish
and
fine
discriminations
as
weak
and
demoralising
things
these
three
the
serf
the
rebel
and
the
squatter
are
three
out
of
a
thousand
types
and
aspects
that
have
gone
to
our
making
in
the
american
composition
they
are
dominant
but
all
those
thousand
different
standards
and
traditions
are
our
material
each
with
something
fine
and
each
with
something
evil
they
have
all
provided
the
atmosphere
of
upbringing
for
men
in
the
past
out
of
them
and
out
of
unprecedented
occasions
we
in
this
newer
age
in
which
there
are
no
slaves
in
which
every
man
is
a
citizen
in
which
the
conveniences
of
a
great
and
growing
civilisation
makes
the
frantic
avidity
of
the
squatter
a
nuisance
have
to
set
ourselves
to
frame
the
standard
of
our
children
children
to
abandon
what
the
slave
or
the
squatter
or
the
rebel
found
necessary
and
that
we
find
unnecessary
to
fit
fresh
requirements
to
our
new
needs
so
we
have
to
develop
our
figure
of
the
fine
man
our
desirable
citizen
in
that
great
and
noble
civilised
state
we
who
have
a
sense
of
the
state
would
build
out
of
the
confusions
of
our
world
to
describe
that
ideal
modern
citizen
now
is
at
best
to
make
a
guess
and
a
suggestion
of
what
must
be
built
in
reality
by
the
efforts
of
a
thousand
minds
but
he
will
be
a
very
different
creature
from
that
indifferent
business
man
who
passes
for
a
good
citizen
he
will
be
neither
under
the
slave
tradition
nor
a
rebel
nor
a
vehement
elemental
man
essentially
he
will
be
aristocratic
aristocratic
not
in
the
sense
that
he
has
slaves
or
class
inferiors
because
probably
he
will
have
nothing
of
the
sort
but
aristocratic
in
the
sense
that
he
will
feel
the
state
belongs
to
him
and
he
to
the
state
he
will
probably
be
a
public
servant
at
any
rate
he
will
be
a
man
doing
some
work
in
the
complicated
machinery
of
the
modern
community
for
a
salary
and
not
for
speculative
gain
typically
he
will
be
a
professional
man
i
do
not
think
the
ideal
modern
citizen
can
be
a
person
living
chiefly
by
buying
for
as
little
as
he
can
give
and
selling
for
as
much
as
he
can
get
indeed
most
of
what
we
idolise
as
business
enterprise
i
think
he
will
regard
with
considerable
contempt
but
then
i
am
a
socialist
and
look
forward
to
the
time
when
the
economic
machinery
of
the
community
will
be
a
field
not
for
private
enrichment
but
for
public
service
he
will
be
good
to
his
wife
and
children
as
he
will
be
good
to
his
friend
but
he
will
be
no
partisan
for
wife
and
family
against
the
common
welfare
his
solicitude
will
be
for
the
welfare
of
all
the
children
of
the
community
he
will
have
got
beyond
blind
instinct
he
will
have
the
intelligence
to
understand
that
almost
any
child
in
the
world
may
have
as
large
a
share
as
his
own
offspring
in
the
parentage
of
his
his
wife
he
will
treat
as
his
equal
he
will
not
be
kind
to
her
but
fair
and
frank
and
loving
as
one
equal
should
be
with
another
he
will
no
more
have
the
impertinence
to
pet
and
pamper
her
to
keep
painful
and
laborious
things
out
of
her
knowledge
to
shield
her
from
the
responsibility
of
political
and
social
work
than
he
will
to
make
a
chinese
toy
of
her
and
bind
her
feet
he
and
she
will
love
that
they
may
enlarge
and
not
limit
one
another
consciously
and
deliberately
the
ideal
citizen
will
seek
beauty
in
himself
and
in
his
way
of
living
he
will
be
temperate
rather
than
harshly
abstinent
and
he
will
keep
himself
fit
and
in
training
as
an
elementary
duty
he
will
not
be
a
fat
or
emaciated
person
fat
panting
men
and
thin
enfeebled
ones
can
not
possibly
be
considered
good
citizens
any
more
than
dirty
or
verminous
people
he
will
be
just
as
fine
and
seemly
in
his
person
as
he
can
be
not
from
vanity
and
but
to
be
pleasing
and
agreeable
to
his
fellows
the
ugly
dress
and
ugly
bearing
of
the
good
man
of
will
be
as
incomprehensible
to
him
as
the
filth
of
a
palaeolithic
savage
is
to
us
he
will
not
speak
of
his
frame
and
hang
clothes
like
sacks
over
it
he
will
know
and
feel
that
he
and
the
people
about
him
have
wonderful
delightful
and
beautiful
bodies
and
i
speak
of
the
ideal
common
citizen
he
will
be
a
student
and
a
philosopher
to
understand
will
be
one
of
his
necessary
duties
his
mind
like
his
body
will
be
fit
and
well
clothed
he
will
not
be
too
busy
to
read
and
think
though
he
may
be
too
busy
to
rush
about
to
get
ignorantly
and
blatantly
rich
it
follows
that
since
he
will
have
a
mind
exercised
finely
and
flexible
and
alert
he
will
not
be
a
secretive
man
secretiveness
and
secret
planning
are
vulgarity
men
and
women
need
to
be
educated
and
he
will
be
educated
out
of
these
vices
he
will
be
intensely
truthful
not
simply
in
the
vulgar
sense
of
not
misstating
facts
when
pressed
but
truthful
in
the
manner
of
the
scientific
man
or
the
artist
and
as
scornful
of
concealment
as
they
truthful
that
is
to
say
as
the
expression
of
a
ruling
desire
to
have
things
made
plain
and
clear
because
that
so
they
are
most
beautiful
and
life
is
at
its
finest
and
all
that
i
have
written
of
him
is
equally
true
and
applies
word
for
word
with
only
such
changes
of
gender
as
are
needed
to
the
woman
citizen
also
some
possible
discoveries
the
present
time
is
harvest
home
for
the
prophets
the
happy
speculator
in
future
sits
on
the
wain
singing
i
told
you
so
with
the
submarine
and
the
flying
machine
and
the
marconigram
and
the
north
pole
successfully
achieved
in
the
tumult
of
realisations
it
perhaps
escapes
attention
that
the
prophetic
output
of
new
hopes
is
by
no
means
keeping
pace
with
the
crop
of
consummations
the
present
trend
of
scientific
development
is
not
nearly
so
obvious
as
it
was
a
score
of
years
ago
its
promises
lack
the
elementary
breadth
of
that
simpler
time
once
you
have
flown
you
have
flown
once
you
have
steamed
about
under
water
you
have
steamed
about
under
water
there
seem
no
more
big
things
of
that
kind
available
so
that
i
almost
regret
the
precipitance
of
commander
peary
and
captain
amundsen
no
one
expects
to
go
beyond
that
atmosphere
for
some
centuries
at
least
all
the
elements
are
now
invaded
conceivably
man
may
presently
contrive
some
sort
of
earthworm
apparatus
so
that
he
could
go
through
the
rocks
prospecting
very
much
as
an
earthworm
goes
through
the
soil
excavating
in
front
and
dumping
behind
but
to
put
it
moderately
there
are
considerable
difficulties
and
i
doubt
the
imaginative
effect
on
the
whole
i
think
material
science
has
got
samples
now
of
all
its
crops
at
this
level
and
that
what
lies
before
it
in
the
coming
years
is
chiefly
to
work
them
out
in
detail
and
realise
them
on
the
larger
scale
no
doubt
science
will
still
yield
all
sorts
of
big
surprising
effects
but
nothing
i
think
to
equal
the
dramatic
novelty
the
demonstration
of
man
having
got
to
something
altogether
new
and
strange
of
montgolfier
or
the
wright
brothers
of
columbus
or
the
polar
conquest
there
remains
of
course
the
tapping
of
atomic
energy
but
i
give
two
hundred
years
yet
before
that
so
far
then
as
mechanical
science
goes
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
coming
period
will
be
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
common
man
almost
without
sensational
interest
there
will
be
an
immense
amount
of
enrichment
and
but
of
the
sort
that
does
not
get
prominently
into
the
daily
papers
at
every
point
there
will
be
economies
and
simplifications
of
method
discoveries
of
new
artificial
substances
with
new
capabilities
and
of
new
methods
of
utilising
power
there
will
be
a
progressive
change
in
the
apparatus
and
quality
of
human
life
the
sort
of
alteration
of
the
percentages
that
causes
no
intellectual
shock
electric
heating
for
example
will
become
practicable
in
our
houses
and
then
cheaper
and
at
last
so
cheap
and
good
that
nobody
will
burn
coal
any
more
little
electric
contrivances
will
dispense
with
menial
service
in
more
and
more
directions
the
builder
will
introduce
new
more
convenient
healthier
and
prettier
substances
and
the
young
architect
will
become
increasingly
the
intelligent
student
of
novelty
the
steam
engine
the
coal
yard
and
the
tail
chimney
and
indeed
all
chimneys
will
vanish
quietly
from
our
urban
landscape
the
speeding
up
and
cheapening
of
travel
and
the
increase
in
its
swiftness
and
comfort
will
go
on
steadily
widening
experience
a
more
systematic
and
understanding
social
science
will
be
estimating
the
probable
growth
and
movement
of
population
and
planning
town
and
country
on
lines
that
would
seem
almost
inconceivably
wise
and
generous
all
this
means
a
quiet
broadening
and
aeration
and
beautifying
of
life
utopian
requirements
so
far
as
the
material
side
of
things
goes
will
be
executed
and
delivered
with
at
last
the
utmost
promptness
it
is
in
quite
other
directions
that
the
scientific
achievements
to
astonish
our
children
will
probably
be
achieved
progress
never
appears
to
be
uniform
in
human
affairs
there
are
intricate
correlations
between
department
and
department
one
field
must
mark
time
until
another
can
come
up
to
it
with
results
sufficiently
arranged
and
conclusions
sufficiently
simplified
for
application
medicine
waits
on
organic
chemistry
geology
on
mineralogy
and
both
on
the
chemistry
of
high
pressures
and
temperature
and
subtle
variations
in
method
and
the
prevailing
mental
temperament
of
the
type
of
writer
engaged
produce
remarkable
differences
in
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
stated
result
moreover
there
are
in
the
history
of
every
scientific
province
periods
of
when
there
is
great
activity
without
immediate
apparent
fruition
and
periods
as
for
example
the
last
two
decades
of
electrical
application
of
prolific
realisation
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
physiologist
and
the
organic
chemist
are
working
towards
that
may
make
the
physician
sphere
the
new
scientific
wonderland
at
present
dietary
and
regimen
are
the
happy
hunting
ground
of
the
quack
and
that
sort
of
volunteer
specialist
who
flourishes
in
the
absence
of
worked
out
and
definite
knowledge
the
general
mass
of
the
medical
profession
equipped
with
a
little
experience
and
a
muddled
training
and
preposterously
impeded
by
the
private
adventure
conditions
under
which
it
lives
goes
about
pretending
to
the
possession
of
precise
knowledge
which
simply
does
not
exist
in
the
world
medical
research
is
and
stupidly
endowed
not
for
systematic
scientific
inquiry
so
much
as
for
the
unscientific
seeking
of
remedies
for
specific
evils
for
cancer
consumption
and
the
like
yet
masked
misrepresented
limited
and
hampered
the
work
of
establishing
a
sound
science
of
vital
processes
in
health
and
disease
is
probably
going
on
now
similar
to
the
clarification
of
physics
and
chemistry
that
went
on
in
the
later
part
of
the
eighteenth
and
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
medicine
may
presently
arrive
at
generalised
convictions
and
proceed
to
take
over
this
great
hinterland
of
human
interests
which
legitimately
belongs
to
it
but
medicine
is
not
the
only
field
to
which
we
may
reasonably
look
for
a
sudden
development
of
wonders
compared
with
the
sciences
of
matter
psychology
and
social
science
have
as
yet
given
the
world
remarkably
little
cause
for
amazement
not
only
is
our
medicine
feeble
and
fragmentary
but
our
educational
science
is
the
poorest
miscellany
of
aphorisms
and
dodges
indeed
directly
one
goes
beyond
the
range
of
measurement
and
weighing
and
classification
one
finds
a
sort
of
unprogressive
floundering
going
on
which
throws
the
strongest
doubts
upon
the
practical
applicability
of
the
current
logical
and
metaphysical
conceptions
in
those
fields
we
have
emerged
only
partially
from
the
age
of
the
schoolmen
in
these
directions
we
have
not
emerged
at
all
it
is
quite
possible
that
in
university
lecture
rooms
and
forbidding
volumes
of
metaphysical
discussion
a
new
emancipation
of
the
human
intellect
and
will
is
even
now
going
on
presently
men
may
be
attacking
the
problems
of
the
of
human
life
and
of
human
destiny
in
new
phrases
and
an
altogether
novel
spirit
guesses
at
the
undiscovered
must
necessarily
be
vague
but
my
anticipations
fall
into
two
groups
and
first
i
am
disposed
to
expect
a
great
systematic
increment
in
individual
human
power
we
probably
have
no
suspicion
as
yet
of
what
may
be
done
with
the
human
body
and
mind
by
way
of
enhancing
its
effectiveness
i
remember
talking
to
the
late
sir
michael
foster
upon
the
possibilities
of
modern
surgery
and
how
he
confessed
that
he
did
not
dare
for
his
reputation
sake
tell
ordinary
people
the
things
he
believed
would
some
day
become
operations
in
that
respect
i
think
he
spoke
for
very
many
of
his
colleagues
it
is
already
possible
to
remove
almost
any
portion
of
the
human
body
including
if
needful
large
sections
of
the
brain
it
is
possible
to
graft
living
flesh
on
living
flesh
make
new
connections
mould
displace
and
rearrange
it
is
also
not
impossible
to
provoke
local
hypertrophy
and
not
only
by
knife
and
physical
treatment
but
by
the
subtler
methods
of
hypnotism
profound
changes
can
be
wrought
in
the
essential
structure
of
a
human
being
if
only
our
knowledge
of
function
and
value
were
at
all
adequate
we
could
correct
and
develop
ourselves
in
the
most
extraordinary
way
our
knowledge
is
not
adequate
but
it
may
not
always
remain
inadequate
we
have
already
had
some
very
astonishing
suggestions
in
this
direction
from
doctor
metchnikoff
he
regards
the
human
stomach
and
large
intestine
as
not
only
vestigial
and
superfluous
in
the
human
economy
but
as
positively
dangerous
on
account
of
the
harbour
they
afford
for
those
bacteria
that
accelerate
the
decay
of
age
he
proposes
that
these
viscera
should
be
removed
to
a
layman
like
myself
this
is
an
altogether
astounding
and
horrifying
idea
but
doctor
metchnikoff
is
a
man
of
the
very
greatest
scientific
reputation
and
it
does
not
give
him
any
qualm
of
horror
or
absurdity
to
advance
it
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
a
gentleman
called
upon
me
done
up
in
the
way
i
am
dimly
suggesting
with
most
of
the
contents
of
his
abdomen
excavated
his
lungs
and
heart
probably
enlarged
and
improved
parts
of
his
brain
removed
to
eliminate
harmful
tendencies
and
make
room
for
the
expansion
of
the
remainder
his
mind
and
sensibilities
increased
and
his
liability
to
fatigue
and
the
need
of
sleep
abolished
i
should
conceal
with
the
utmost
difficulty
my
inexpressible
disgust
and
terror
but
then
if
blériot
with
his
flying
machine
and
goggles
had
soared
down
in
the
year
let
us
say
upon
my
ancestors
every
family
man
in
britain
was
my
ancestor
in
those
days
at
dover
they
would
have
had
entirely
similar
emotions
and
at
present
i
am
not
discussing
what
is
beautiful
in
humanity
but
what
is
possible
and
what
being
possible
is
likely
to
be
attempted
it
does
not
follow
that
because
men
will
some
day
have
this
enormous
power
over
themselves
physically
and
mentally
that
they
will
necessarily
make
themselves
horrible
even
by
our
present
standards
quite
a
lot
of
us
would
be
all
the
slenderer
and
more
active
and
graceful
for
metchnikoffing
nor
does
surgery
exhaust
the
available
methods
we
are
still
in
the
barbaric
age
so
far
as
our
use
of
food
and
drugs
is
concerned
we
stuff
all
sorts
of
substances
into
our
unfortunate
interiors
and
blunder
upon
the
most
various
consequences
few
people
of
three
score
and
ten
but
have
spent
in
the
aggregate
the
best
part
of
a
year
in
a
state
of
indigestion
stupid
angry
or
painful
indigestion
as
the
case
may
be
no
one
would
be
so
careless
and
ignorant
about
the
fuel
he
burnt
in
his
as
most
of
us
are
about
the
fuel
we
burn
in
our
bodies
and
there
are
all
sort
of
stimulating
and
exhilarating
things
digesting
things
things
exercise
economising
things
we
dare
not
use
because
we
are
afraid
of
our
ignorance
of
their
precise
working
there
seems
no
reason
to
suppose
that
human
life
properly
understood
and
controlled
could
not
be
a
constant
succession
of
delightful
and
for
the
most
part
active
bodily
and
mental
phases
it
is
sheer
ignorance
and
bad
management
that
keep
the
majority
of
people
in
that
disagreeable
system
of
states
which
we
indicate
by
saying
we
are
a
bit
off
colour
or
a
little
out
of
training
it
may
seem
madly
utopian
now
to
suggest
that
practically
everyone
in
the
community
might
be
clean
beautiful
incessantly
active
fit
and
with
the
marks
of
all
the
surgery
they
have
undergone
quite
healed
and
hidden
but
not
more
madly
utopian
than
it
would
have
seemed
to
king
alfred
the
great
if
one
had
said
that
practically
everyone
in
this
country
down
to
the
very
swineherds
should
be
able
to
read
and
write
metchnikoff
has
speculated
upon
the
possibility
of
delaying
old
age
and
i
do
not
see
why
his
method
should
not
be
applied
to
the
diurnal
need
of
sleep
no
vital
process
seems
to
be
absolutely
fated
in
itself
it
is
a
thing
conditioned
and
capable
of
modification
if
metchnikoff
is
right
and
to
a
certain
extent
he
must
be
right
the
decay
of
age
is
due
to
changing
organic
processes
that
may
be
checked
and
delayed
and
modified
by
suitable
food
and
regimen
he
holds
out
hope
of
a
new
phase
in
the
human
cycle
after
the
phase
of
struggle
and
passion
a
phase
of
serene
intellectual
activity
old
age
with
all
its
experience
and
none
of
its
infirmities
still
more
are
fatigue
and
the
need
for
repose
dependent
upon
chemical
changes
in
the
body
it
would
seem
we
are
unable
to
maintain
exertion
partly
through
the
exhaustion
of
our
tissues
but
far
more
by
the
loading
of
our
blood
with
fatigue
products
a
recuperative
interlude
must
ensue
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
usual
food
of
is
the
most
rapidly
assimilable
nurture
possible
that
a
rapidly
digestible
or
injectable
substance
is
not
conceivable
that
would
vastly
accelerate
repair
nor
that
the
elimination
and
neutralisation
of
fatigue
products
might
not
also
be
enormously
hastened
there
is
no
inherent
impossibility
in
the
idea
not
only
of
various
glands
being
induced
to
function
in
a
modified
manner
but
even
in
the
insertion
upon
the
circulation
of
interceptors
and
artificial
glandular
structures
no
doubt
that
may
strike
even
an
adventurous
surgeon
as
chimerical
but
consider
what
people
even
authoritative
people
were
saying
of
flying
and
electric
traction
twenty
years
ago
at
present
a
man
probably
does
not
get
more
than
three
or
four
hours
of
maximum
mental
and
physical
efficiency
in
the
day
few
men
can
keep
at
their
best
in
either
physical
or
intellectual
work
for
so
long
as
that
the
rest
of
the
time
goes
in
feeding
digesting
sleeping
sitting
about
relaxation
of
various
kinds
it
is
quite
possible
that
science
may
set
itself
presently
to
extend
systematically
that
proportion
of
efficient
time
the
area
of
maximum
efficiency
may
invade
the
periods
now
demanded
by
digestion
sleep
exercise
so
that
at
last
nearly
the
whole
of
a
man
hours
will
be
concentrated
on
his
primary
interests
instead
of
dispersed
among
these
secondary
necessary
matters
please
understand
i
do
not
consider
this
concentration
of
activity
and
these
vast
artificialisations
of
the
human
body
as
attractive
or
desirable
things
at
the
first
proposal
much
of
this
tampering
with
the
natural
stuff
of
life
will
strike
anyone
i
think
as
ugly
and
horrible
just
as
seeing
a
little
child
and
still
under
an
anaesthetic
gripped
my
heart
much
more
dreadfully
than
the
sight
of
the
same
child
actively
bawling
with
pain
but
the
business
of
this
paper
is
to
discuss
things
that
may
happen
and
not
to
evolve
dreams
of
loveliness
perhaps
things
of
this
kind
will
be
manageable
without
dreadfulness
perhaps
man
will
come
to
such
wisdom
that
neither
the
knife
nor
the
drugs
nor
any
of
the
powers
which
science
thrusts
into
his
hand
will
slay
the
beauty
of
life
for
him
suppose
we
assume
that
he
is
not
such
a
fool
as
to
let
that
happen
and
that
ultimately
he
will
emerge
triumphant
with
all
these
powers
utilised
and
controlled
it
is
not
only
that
an
amplifying
science
may
give
mankind
happier
bodies
and
far
more
active
and
eventful
lives
but
that
psychology
and
educational
and
social
science
reinforcing
literature
and
working
through
literature
and
art
may
dare
to
establish
serenities
in
his
soul
for
surely
no
one
who
has
lived
no
one
who
has
watched
sin
and
crime
and
punishment
but
must
have
come
to
realise
the
enormous
amount
of
misbehaviour
that
is
mere
ignorance
and
want
of
mental
scope
for
my
own
part
i
have
never
believed
in
the
devil
and
it
may
be
a
greater
undertaking
but
no
more
impossible
to
make
ways
to
goodwill
and
a
good
heart
in
men
than
it
is
to
tunnel
mountains
and
dyke
back
the
sea
the
way
that
led
from
the
darkness
of
the
cave
to
the
electric
light
is
the
way
that
will
lead
to
light
in
the
souls
of
men
that
is
to
say
the
way
of
free
and
fearless
thinking
free
and
fearless
experiment
organised
exchange
of
thoughts
and
results
and
patience
and
persistence
and
a
sort
of
intellectual
civility
and
with
the
development
of
philosophical
and
scientific
method
that
will
go
on
with
this
great
increase
in
man
control
over
himself
another
issue
that
is
now
a
mere
pious
aspiration
above
abysses
of
ignorance
and
difficulty
will
come
to
be
a
manageable
matter
it
has
been
the
perpetual
wonder
of
philosophers
from
plato
onward
that
men
have
bred
their
dogs
and
horses
and
left
any
man
or
woman
however
vile
free
to
bear
offspring
in
the
next
generation
of
men
still
that
goes
on
beautiful
and
wonderful
people
die
childless
and
bury
their
treasure
in
the
grave
and
we
rest
content
with
a
system
of
matrimony
that
seems
designed
to
perpetuate
mediocrity
a
day
will
come
when
men
will
be
in
possession
of
knowledge
and
opportunity
that
will
enable
them
to
master
this
position
and
then
certainly
will
it
be
assured
that
every
generation
shall
be
born
better
than
was
the
one
before
it
and
with
that
the
history
of
humanity
will
enter
upon
a
new
phase
a
phase
which
will
be
to
our
lives
as
daylight
is
to
the
dreaming
of
a
child
as
yet
unborn
the
human
adventure
alone
among
all
the
living
things
this
globe
has
borne
man
reckons
with
destiny
all
other
living
things
obey
the
forces
that
created
them
and
when
the
mood
of
the
power
changes
submit
themselves
passively
to
extinction
man
only
looks
upon
those
forces
in
the
face
anticipates
the
exhaustion
of
nature
kindliness
seeks
weapons
to
defend
himself
last
of
the
children
of
saturn
he
escapes
their
general
doom
he
dispossesses
his
begetter
of
all
possibility
of
replacement
and
grasps
the
sceptre
of
the
world
before
man
the
great
and
prevalent
creatures
followed
one
another
processionally
to
extinction
the
early
monsters
of
the
ancient
seas
the
clumsy
amphibians
struggling
breathless
to
the
land
the
reptiles
the
theriomorpha
and
the
dinosaurs
the
reptiles
of
the
mesozoic
forests
the
colossal
grotesque
first
mammals
the
giant
sloths
the
mastodons
and
mammoths
it
is
as
if
some
idle
dreamer
moulded
them
and
broke
them
and
cast
them
aside
until
at
last
comes
man
and
seizes
the
creative
wrist
that
would
wipe
him
out
of
being
again
there
is
nothing
else
in
all
the
world
that
so
turns
against
the
powers
that
have
made
it
unless
it
be
man
follower
fire
but
fire
is
witless
a
little
stream
a
changing
breeze
can
stop
it
man
circumvents
if
fire
were
human
it
would
build
boats
across
the
rivers
and
outmanoeuvre
the
wind
it
would
lie
in
wait
in
sheltered
places
smouldering
husbanding
its
fuel
until
the
grass
was
yellow
and
the
forests
sere
but
fire
is
a
mere
creature
of
man
our
world
before
his
coming
knew
nothing
of
it
in
any
of
its
habitable
places
never
saw
it
except
in
the
lightning
flash
or
remotely
on
some
volcanic
coronet
man
brought
it
into
the
commerce
of
life
a
shining
resentful
slave
to
hound
off
the
startled
beasts
from
his
and
serve
him
like
a
dog
suppose
that
some
enduring
intelligence
watched
through
the
ages
the
successions
of
life
upon
this
planet
marked
the
spreading
first
of
this
species
and
then
that
the
conflicts
the
adaptations
the
predominances
the
dyings
away
and
conceive
how
it
would
have
witnessed
this
strange
dramatic
emergence
of
a
rare
great
ape
to
manhood
to
such
a
mind
the
creature
would
have
seemed
at
first
no
more
than
one
of
several
varieties
of
clambering
frugivorous
mammals
a
little
distinguished
by
a
disposition
to
help
his
clumsy
walking
with
a
stake
and
reinforce
his
fist
with
a
stone
the
foreground
of
the
picture
would
have
been
filled
by
the
rhinoceros
and
mammoth
the
great
herds
of
ruminants
the
lion
and
the
big
bears
then
presently
the
observer
would
have
noted
a
peculiar
increasing
handiness
about
the
obscurer
type
an
unwonted
intelligence
growing
behind
its
eyes
he
would
have
perceived
a
disposition
in
this
creature
no
beast
had
shown
before
a
disposition
to
make
itself
independent
of
the
conditions
of
climate
and
the
chances
of
the
seasons
did
shelter
fail
among
the
trees
and
rocks
this
curious
new
to
make
itself
harbours
of
its
own
was
food
irregular
it
multiplied
food
it
began
to
spread
out
from
its
original
circumstances
fitting
itself
to
novel
needs
leaving
the
forests
invading
the
plains
following
the
watercourses
upward
and
downward
presently
carrying
the
smoke
of
its
fires
like
a
banner
of
conquest
into
wintry
desolations
and
the
high
places
of
the
earth
the
first
onset
of
man
must
have
been
comparatively
slow
the
first
advances
needed
long
ages
by
small
degrees
it
gathered
pace
the
stride
from
the
scattered
savagery
of
the
earlier
stone
period
to
the
first
cities
historically
a
vast
interval
would
have
seemed
to
that
still
watcher
measuring
by
the
standards
of
astronomy
and
the
rise
and
decline
of
races
and
genera
and
orders
a
step
almost
abrupt
it
took
perhaps
a
thousand
generations
or
so
to
make
it
in
that
interval
man
passed
from
an
obedience
to
the
climate
and
the
weather
and
his
own
instincts
from
living
in
small
family
parties
of
a
score
or
so
over
restricted
areas
of
indulgent
country
to
permanent
settlements
to
the
life
of
tribal
and
national
communities
and
the
beginnings
of
cities
he
had
spread
in
that
fragment
of
time
over
great
areas
of
the
earth
surface
and
now
he
was
adapting
himself
to
the
arctic
circle
on
the
one
hand
and
to
the
life
of
the
tropics
on
the
other
he
had
invented
the
plough
and
the
ship
and
subjugated
most
of
the
domestic
animals
he
was
beginning
to
think
of
the
origin
of
the
world
and
the
mysteries
of
being
writing
had
added
its
enduring
records
to
oral
tradition
and
he
was
already
making
roads
another
five
or
six
hundred
generations
at
most
bring
him
to
ourselves
we
sweep
into
the
field
of
that
the
momentary
incarnations
of
this
sempiternal
being
man
and
after
us
there
comes
a
curtain
falls
the
time
in
which
we
whose
minds
meet
here
in
this
writing
were
born
and
live
and
die
would
be
to
that
imagined
observer
a
mere
phase
in
the
swarming
liberation
of
our
kind
from
ancient
imperatives
it
would
seem
to
him
a
phase
of
unprecedented
swift
change
and
expansion
and
achievement
in
this
last
handful
of
years
electricity
has
ceased
to
be
a
curious
toy
and
now
carries
half
mankind
upon
their
daily
journeys
it
lights
our
cities
till
they
outshine
the
moon
and
stars
and
reduces
to
our
service
a
score
of
hitherto
unsuspected
metals
we
clamber
to
the
pole
of
our
globe
scale
every
mountain
soar
into
the
air
learn
how
to
overcome
the
malaria
that
barred
our
white
races
from
the
tropics
and
how
to
draw
the
sting
from
a
hundred
such
agents
of
death
our
old
cities
are
being
rebuilt
in
towering
marble
great
new
cities
rise
to
vie
with
them
never
it
would
seem
has
man
been
so
various
and
busy
and
persistent
and
there
is
no
intimation
of
any
check
to
the
expansion
of
his
energies
and
all
this
continually
accelerated
advance
has
come
through
the
quickening
and
increase
of
man
intelligence
and
its
reinforcement
through
speech
and
writing
all
this
has
come
in
spite
of
fierce
instincts
that
make
him
the
most
combatant
and
destructive
of
animals
and
in
spite
of
the
revenge
nature
has
attempted
time
after
time
for
his
rebellion
against
her
routines
in
the
form
of
strange
diseases
and
nearly
universal
pestilences
all
this
has
come
as
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
first
obscure
gleaming
of
deliberate
thought
and
reason
through
the
veil
of
his
animal
being
to
begin
with
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
he
sought
his
more
immediate
satisfaction
and
safety
and
security
he
still
apprehends
imperfectly
the
change
that
comes
upon
him
the
illusion
of
separation
that
makes
animal
life
that
is
to
say
passionate
competing
and
breeding
and
dying
possible
the
blinkers
nature
has
put
upon
us
that
we
may
clash
against
and
sharpen
one
another
still
darken
our
eyes
we
live
not
life
as
yet
but
in
millions
of
separated
lives
still
unaware
except
in
rare
moods
of
illumination
that
we
are
more
than
those
fellow
beasts
of
ours
who
drop
off
from
the
tree
of
life
and
perish
alone
it
is
only
in
the
last
three
or
four
thousand
years
and
through
weak
and
tentative
methods
of
expression
through
clumsy
cosmogonies
and
theologies
and
with
incalculable
confusion
and
discoloration
that
the
human
mind
has
felt
its
way
towards
its
undying
being
in
the
race
man
still
goes
to
war
against
himself
prepares
fleets
and
armies
and
fortresses
like
a
who
wounds
himself
like
some
infatuated
barbarian
who
hacks
his
own
limbs
with
a
knife
but
he
awakens
the
nightmares
of
empire
and
racial
conflict
and
war
the
grotesques
of
trade
jealousy
and
tariffs
the
primordial
of
lewdness
and
jealousy
and
cruelty
pale
before
the
daylight
which
filters
between
his
eyelids
in
a
little
while
we
individuals
will
know
ourselves
surely
for
corpuscles
in
his
being
for
thoughts
that
come
together
out
of
strange
wanderings
into
the
coherence
of
a
waking
mind
a
few
score
generations
ago
all
living
things
were
in
our
ancestry
a
few
score
generations
ahead
and
all
mankind
will
be
in
sober
fact
descendants
from
our
blood
in
physical
as
in
mental
fact
we
separate
persons
with
all
our
difference
and
individuality
are
but
fragments
set
apart
for
a
little
while
in
order
that
we
may
return
to
the
general
life
again
with
fresh
experiences
and
fresh
acquirements
as
bees
return
with
pollen
and
nourishment
to
the
fellowship
of
the
hive

this
man
this
wonderful
child
of
old
earth
who
is
ourselves
in
the
measure
of
our
hearts

minds
does
but
begin
his
adventure
now
through
all

henceforth
he
does
but
begin
his
adventure
this
planet
and
its
subjugation
is
but
the
dawn
of
his
existence
in
a
little
while
he
will
reach
out
to
the
other
planets
and
take
that
greater
fire
the
sun
into
his
service
he
will
bring
his
solvent
intelligence
to
bear
upon
the
riddles
of
his
individual
interaction
transmute
jealousy
and
every
passion
control
his
own
increase
select
and
breed
for
his
embodiment
a
continually
finer
and
stronger
and
wiser
race
what
none
of
us
can
think
or
will
save
in
a
disconnected
partiality
he
will
think
and
will
collectively
already
some
of
us
feel
our
merger
with
that
greater
life
there
come
moments
when
the
thing
shines
out
upon
our
thoughts
sometimes
in
the
dark
sleepless
solitudes
of
night
one
ceases
to
be
one
ceases
to
bear
a
proper
name
forgets
quarrels
and
vanities
forgives
and
understands

enemies
and
oneself
as
one
forgives
and
understands
the
quarrels
of

knowing

to
unmeasured
destinies
through
the
starry
stillnesses
of
space
