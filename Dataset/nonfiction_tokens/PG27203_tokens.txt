through

by

and

on
what
autosuggestion
can
do

education

it
ought
to
be

a

mastery
through
conscious
autosuggestion
suggestion
or
rather
autosuggestion
is
quite
a
new
subject
and
yet
at
the
same
time
it
is
as
old
as
the
world
it
is
new
in
the
sense
that
until
now
it
has
been
wrongly
studied
and
in
consequence
wrongly
understood
it
is
old
because
it
dates
from
the
appearance
of
man
on
the
earth
in
fact
autosuggestion
is
an
instrument
that
we
possess
at
birth
and
in
this
instrument
or
rather
in
this
force
resides
a
marvelous
and
incalculable
power
which
according
to
circumstances
produces
the
best
or
the
worst
results
knowledge
of
this
force
is
useful
to
each
one
of
us
but
it
is
peculiarly
indispensable
to
doctors
magistrates
lawyers
and
to
those
engaged
in
the
work
of
education
by
knowing
how
to
practise
it
it
is
possible
in
the
first
place
to
avoid
provoking
in
others
bad
autosuggestions
which
may
have
disastrous
consequences
and
secondly
consciously
to
provoke
good
ones
instead
thus
bringing
physical
health
to
the
sick
and
moral
health
to
the
neurotic
and
the
erring
the
unconscious
victims
of
anterior
autosuggestions
and
to
guide
into
the
right
path
those
who
had
a
tendency
to
take
the
wrong
one
the
conscious
self
and
the
unconscious
self
in
order
to
understand
properly
the
phenomena
of
suggestion
or
to
speak
more
correctly
of
autosuggestion
it
is
necessary
to
know
that
two
absolutely
distinct
selves
exist
within
us
both
are
intelligent
but
while
one
is
conscious
the
other
is
unconscious
for
this
reason
the
existence
of
the
latter
generally
escapes
notice
it
is
however
easy
to
prove
its
existence
if
one
merely
takes
the
trouble
to
examine
certain
phenomena
and
to
reflect
a
few
moments
upon
them
let
us
take
for
instance
the
following
examples
every
one
has
heard
of
somnambulism
every
one
knows
that
a
somnambulist
gets
up
at
night
leaves
his
room
after
either
dressing
himself
or
not
goes
downstairs
walks
along
corridors
and
after
having
executed
certain
acts
or
accomplished
certain
work
returns
to
his
room
goes
to
bed
again
and
shows
next
day
the
greatest
astonishment
at
finding
work
finished
which
he
had
left
unfinished
the
day
before
it
is
however
he
himself
who
has
done
it
without
being
aware
of
it
what
force
has
his
body
obeyed
if
it
is
not
an
unconscious
force
in
fact
his
unconscious
self
let
us
now
examine
the
alas
too
frequent
case
of
a
drunkard
attacked
by
as
though
seized
with
madness
he
picks
up
the
nearest
weapon
knife
hammer
or
hatchet
as
the
case
may
be
and
strikes
furiously
those
who
are
unlucky
enough
to
be
in
his
vicinity
once
the
attack
is
over
he
recovers
his
senses
and
contemplates
with
horror
the
scene
of
carnage
around
him
without
realizing
that
he
himself
is
the
author
of
it
here
again
is
it
not
the
unconscious
self
which
has
caused
the
unhappy
man
to
act
in
this
way
and
what
aversions
what
ills
we
create
for
ourselves
everyone
of
us
and
in
every
domain
by
not
immediately
bringing
into
play
good
conscious
autosuggestions
against
our
bad
unconscious
autosuggestions
thus
bringing
about
the
disappearance
of
all
unjust
suffering
if
we
compare
the
conscious
with
the
unconscious
self
we
see
that
the
conscious
self
is
often
possessed
of
a
very
unreliable
memory
while
the
unconscious
self
on
the
contrary
is
provided
with
a
marvelous
and
impeccable
memory
which
registers
without
our
knowledge
the
smallest
events
the
least
important
acts
of
our
existence
further
it
is
credulous
and
accepts
with
unreasoning
docility
what
it
is
told
thus
as
it
is
the
unconscious
that
is
responsible
for
the
functioning
of
all
our
organs
but
the
intermediary
of
the
brain
a
result
is
produced
which
may
seem
rather
paradoxical
to
you
that
is
if
it
believes
that
a
certain
organ
functions
well
or
ill
or
that
we
feel
such
and
such
an
impression
the
organ
in
question
does
indeed
function
well
or
ill
or
we
do
feel
that
impression
not
only
does
the
unconscious
self
preside
over
the
functions
of
our
organism
but
also
over
our
actions
whatever
they
it
is
this
that
we
call
imagination
and
it
is
this
which
contrary
to
accepted
opinion
makes
us
act
even
and
against
when
there
is
antagonism
between
these
two
forces
will
and
imagination
if
we
open
a
dictionary
and
look
up
the
word
will
we
find
this
definition
the
faculty
of
freely
determining
certain
acts
we
accept
this
definition
as
true
and
unattackable
although
nothing
could
be
more
false
this
will
that
we
claim
so
proudly
always
to
the
imagination
it
is
an
rule
that
admits
of
no
blasphemy
paradox
you
will
exclaim
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
purest
truth
i
shall
reply
in
order
to
convince
yourself
of
it
open
your
eyes
look
round
you
and
try
to
understand
what
you
see
you
will
then
come
to
the
conclusion
that
what
i
tell
you
is
not
an
idle
theory
offspring
of
a
sick
brain
but
the
simple
expression
of
a
suppose
that
we
place
on
the
ground
a
plank
feet
long
by
foot
wide
it
is
evident
that
everybody
will
be
capable
of
going
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
this
plank
without
stepping
over
the
edge
but
now
change
the
conditions
of
the
experiment
and
imagine
this
plank
placed
at
the
height
of
the
towers
of
a
cathedral
who
then
will
be
capable
of
advancing
even
a
few
feet
along
this
narrow
path
could
you
hear
me
speak
probably
not
before
you
had
taken
two
steps
you
would
begin
to
tremble
and
spite
of
every
effort
of
your
you
would
be
certain
to
fall
to
the
ground
why
is
it
then
that
you
would
not
fall
if
the
plank
is
on
the
ground
and
why
should
you
fall
if
it
is
raised
to
a
height
above
the
ground
simply
because
in
the
first
case
you
imagine
that
it
is
easy
to
go
to
the
end
of
this
plank
while
in
the
second
case
you
that
you
do
so
notice
that
your
will
is
powerless
to
make
you
advance
if
you
that
you
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
do
so
if
tilers
and
carpenters
are
able
to
accomplish
this
feat
it
is
because
they
think
they
can
do
it
vertigo
is
entirely
caused
by
the
picture
we
make
in
our
minds
that
we
are
going
to
fall
this
picture
transforms
itself
immediately
into
fact
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
our
and
the
more
violent
these
efforts
are
the
quicker
is
the
opposite
to
the
desired
result
brought
about
let
us
now
consider
the
case
of
a
person
suffering
from
insomnia
if
he
does
not
make
any
effort
to
sleep
he
will
lie
quietly
in
bed
if
on
the
contrary
he
tries
to
force
himself
to
sleep
by
his
the
more
efforts
he
makes
the
more
restless
he
becomes
have
you
not
noticed
that
the
more
you
try
to
remember
the
name
of
a
person
which
you
have
forgotten
the
more
it
eludes
you
until
substituting
in
your
mind
the
idea
i
shall
remember
in
a
minute
to
the
idea
i
have
forgotten
the
name
comes
back
to
you
of
its
own
accord
without
the
least
effort
let
those
of
you
who
are
cyclists
remember
the
days
when
you
were
learning
to
ride
you
went
along
clutching
the
handle
bars
and
frightened
of
falling
suddenly
catching
sight
of
the
smallest
obstacle
in
the
road
you
tried
to
avoid
it
and
the
more
efforts
you
made
to
do
so
the
more
surely
you
rushed
upon
it
who
has
not
suffered
from
an
attack
of
uncontrollable
laughter
which
bursts
out
more
violently
the
more
one
tries
to
control
it
what
was
the
state
of
mind
of
each
person
in
these
different
circumstances
do
not
to
fall
but
i
doing
so
i
to
sleep
but
i
i
to
remember
the
name
of
mrs
so
and
so
but
i
i
to
avoid
the
obstacle
but
i
i
to
stop
laughing
but
i
as
you
see
in
each
of
these
conflicts
it
is
always
the
which
gains
the
victory
over
the
without
any
exception
to
the
same
order
of
ideas
belongs
the
case
of
the
leader
who
rushes
forward
at
the
head
of
his
troops
and
always
carries
them
along
with
him
while
the
cry
each
man
for
himself
is
almost
certain
to
cause
a
defeat
why
is
this
it
is
because
in
the
first
case
the
men
that
they
must
go
and
in
the
second
they
that
they
are
conquered
and
must
fly
for
their
lives
panurge
was
quite
aware
of
the
contagion
of
example
that
is
to
say
the
action
of
the
imagination
when
to
avenge
himself
upon
a
merchant
on
board
the
same
boat
he
bought
his
biggest
sheep
and
threw
it
into
the
sea
certain
beforehand
that
the
entire
flock
would
follow
which
indeed
happened
we
human
beings
have
a
certain
resemblance
to
sheep
and
involuntarily
we
are
irresistibly
impelled
to
follow
other
examples
that
we
can
not
do
otherwise
i
could
quote
a
thousand
other
examples
but
i
should
fear
to
bore
you
by
such
an
enumeration
i
can
not
however
pass
by
in
silence
this
fact
which
shows
the
enormous
power
of
the
imagination
or
in
other
words
of
the
unconscious
in
its
struggle
against
the
there
are
certain
drunkards
who
wish
to
give
up
drinking
but
who
can
not
do
so
ask
them
and
they
will
reply
in
all
sincerity
that
they
desire
to
be
sober
that
drink
disgusts
them
but
that
they
are
irresistibly
impelled
to
drink
against
their
in
spite
of
the
harm
they
know
it
will
do
them
in
the
same
way
certain
criminals
commit
crimes
spite
of
and
when
they
are
asked
why
they
acted
so
they
answer
i
could
not
help
it
something
impelled
me
it
was
stronger
than
i
and
the
drunkard
and
the
criminal
speak
the
truth
they
are
forced
to
do
what
they
do
for
the
simple
reason
they
imagine
they
can
not
prevent
themselves
from
doing
so
thus
we
who
are
so
proud
of
our
will
who
believe
that
we
are
free
to
act
as
we
like
are
in
reality
nothing
but
wretched
puppets
of
which
our
imagination
holds
all
the
strings
we
only
cease
to
be
puppets
when
we
have
learned
to
guide
our
imagination
suggestion
and
autosuggestion
according
to
the
preceding
remarks
we
can
compare
the
imagination
to
a
torrent
which
fatally
sweeps
away
the
poor
wretch
who
has
fallen
into
it
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
gain
the
bank
this
torrent
seems
indomitable
but
if
you
know
how
you
can
turn
it
from
its
course
and
conduct
it
to
the
factory
and
there
you
can
transform
its
force
into
movement
heat
and
electricity
if
this
simile
is
not
enough
we
may
compare
the
imagination
the
madman
at
home
as
it
has
been
called
to
an
unbroken
horse
which
has
neither
bridle
nor
reins
what
can
the
rider
do
except
let
himself
go
wherever
the
horse
wishes
to
take
him
and
often
if
the
latter
runs
away
his
mad
career
only
comes
to
end
in
the
ditch
if
however
the
rider
succeeds
in
putting
a
bridle
on
the
horse
the
parts
are
reversed
it
is
no
longer
the
horse
who
goes
where
he
likes
it
is
the
rider
who
obliges
the
horse
to
take
him
wherever
he
wishes
to
go
now
that
we
have
learned
to
realize
the
enormous
power
of
the
unconscious
or
imaginative
being
i
am
going
to
show
how
this
self
hitherto
considered
indomitable
can
be
as
easily
controlled
as
a
torrent
or
an
unbroken
horse
but
before
going
any
further
it
is
necessary
to
define
carefully
two
words
that
are
often
used
without
being
properly
understood
these
are
the
words
and
what
then
is
suggestion
it
may
be
defined
as
the
act
of
imposing
an
idea
on
the
brain
of
another
does
this
action
really
exist
properly
speaking
no
suggestion
does
not
indeed
exist
by
itself
it
does
not
and
can
not
exist
except
on
the
qua
condition
of
transforming
itself
into
in
the
subject
this
latter
word
may
be
defined
as
the
implanting
of
an
idea
in
oneself
by
oneself
you
may
make
a
suggestion
to
someone
if
the
unconscious
of
the
latter
does
not
accept
the
suggestion
if
it
has
not
as
it
were
digested
it
in
order
to
transform
it
into
it
produces
no
result
i
have
myself
occasionally
made
a
more
or
less
commonplace
suggestion
to
ordinarily
very
obedient
subjects
quite
unsuccessfully
the
reason
is
that
the
unconscious
of
the
subject
refused
to
accept
it
and
did
not
transform
it
into
the
use
of
autosuggestion
let
us
now
return
to
the
point
where
i
said
that
we
can
control
and
lead
our
imagination
just
as
a
torrent
or
an
unbroken
horse
can
be
controlled
to
do
so
it
is
enough
in
the
first
place
to
know
that
this
is
possible
of
which
fact
almost
everyone
is
ignorant
and
secondly
to
know
by
what
means
it
can
be
done
well
the
means
is
very
simple
it
is
that
which
we
have
used
every
day
since
we
came
into
the
world
without
wishing
or
knowing
it
and
absolutely
unconsciously
but
which
unfortunately
for
us
we
often
use
wrongly
and
to
our
own
detriment
this
means
is
whereas
we
constantly
give
ourselves
unconscious
autosuggestions
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
give
ourselves
conscious
ones
and
the
process
consists
in
this
first
to
weigh
carefully
in
one
mind
the
things
which
are
to
be
the
object
of
the
autosuggestion
and
according
as
they
require
the
answer
yes
or
no
to
repeat
several
times
without
thinking
of
anything
else
this
thing
is
coming
or
this
thing
is
going
away
this
thing
will
or
will
not
happen
if
the
unconscious
accepts
this
suggestion
and
transforms
it
into
an
autosuggestion
the
thing
or
things
are
realized
in
every
particular
of
course
the
thing
must
be
in
our
power
thus
understood
is
nothing
but
hypnotism
as
i
see
it
and
i
would
define
it
in
these
simple
words
influence
of
the
imagination
upon
the
moral
and
physical
being
of
now
this
influence
is
undeniable
and
without
returning
to
previous
examples
i
will
quote
a
few
others
if
you
persuade
yourself
that
you
can
do
a
certain
thing
provided
this
thing
be
you
will
do
it
however
difficult
it
may
be
if
on
the
contrary
you
that
you
can
not
do
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
do
it
and
molehills
become
for
you
unscalable
mountains
such
is
the
case
of
neurasthenics
who
believing
themselves
incapable
of
the
least
effort
often
find
it
impossible
even
to
walk
a
few
steps
without
being
exhausted
and
these
same
neurasthenics
sink
more
deeply
into
their
depression
the
more
efforts
they
make
to
throw
it
off
like
the
poor
wretch
in
the
quicksands
who
sinks
in
all
the
deeper
the
more
he
tries
to
struggle
out
in
the
same
way
it
is
sufficient
to
think
a
pain
is
going
to
feel
it
indeed
disappear
little
by
little
and
inversely
it
is
enough
to
think
that
one
suffers
in
order
to
feel
the
pain
begin
to
come
immediately
i
know
certain
people
who
predict
in
advance
that
they
will
have
a
sick
headache
on
a
certain
day
in
certain
circumstances
and
on
that
day
in
the
given
circumstances
sure
enough
they
feel
it
they
brought
their
illness
on
themselves
just
as
others
cure
theirs
by
i
know
that
one
generally
passes
for
mad
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
if
one
dares
to
put
forward
ideas
which
it
is
not
accustomed
to
hear
well
at
the
risk
of
being
thought
so
i
say
that
if
certain
people
are
ill
mentally
and
physically
it
is
that
they
themselves
to
be
ill
mentally
or
physically
if
certain
others
are
paralytic
without
having
any
lesion
to
account
for
it
it
is
that
they
themselves
to
be
paralyzed
and
it
is
among
such
persons
that
the
most
extraordinary
cures
are
produced
if
others
again
are
happy
or
unhappy
it
is
that
they
imagine
themselves
to
be
so
for
it
is
possible
for
two
people
in
exactly
the
same
circumstances
to
be
the
one
the
other
neurasthenia
stammering
aversions
kleptomania
certain
cases
of
paralysis
are
nothing
but
the
result
of
unconscious
autosuggestion
that
is
to
say
the
result
of
the
action
of
the
upon
the
physical
and
moral
being
but
if
our
unconscious
is
the
source
of
many
of
our
ills
it
can
also
bring
about
the
cure
of
our
physical
and
mental
ailments
it
can
not
only
repair
the
ill
it
has
done
but
cure
real
illnesses
so
strong
is
its
action
upon
our
organism
shut
yourself
up
alone
in
a
room
seat
yourself
in
an
armchair
close
your
eyes
to
avoid
any
distraction
and
concentrate
your
mind
for
a
few
moments
on
thinking
such
and
such
a
thing
is
going
to
disappear
or
such
and
such
a
thing
is
coming
to
pass
if
you
have
really
made
the
autosuggestion
that
is
to
say
if
your
unconscious
has
assimilated
the
idea
that
you
have
presented
to
it
you
are
astonished
to
see
the
thing
you
have
thought
come
to
pass
note
that
it
is
the
property
of
ideas
autosuggested
to
exist
within
us
unrecognized
and
we
can
only
know
of
their
existence
by
the
effect
they
produce
but
above
all
and
this
is
an
essential
point
the
will
must
not
be
brought
into
play
in
practising
autosuggestion
for
if
it
is
not
in
agreement
with
the
imagination
if
one
thinks
i
will
make
such
and
such
a
thing
happen
and
the
imagination
says
you
are
willing
it
but
it
is
not
going
to
be
not
only
does
one
not
obtain
what
one
wants
but
even
exactly
the
reverse
is
brought
about
this
remark
is
of
capital
importance
and
explains
why
results
are
so
unsatisfactory
when
in
treating
moral
ailments
one
strives
to
the
will
it
is
the
of
the
which
is
necessary
and
it
is
thanks
to
this
shade
of
difference
that
my
method
has
often
succeeded
where
others
and
those
not
the
least
considered
have
failed
from
the
numerous
experiments
that
i
have
made
daily
for
twenty
years
and
which
i
have
examined
with
minute
care
i
have
been
able
to
deduct
the
following
conclusions
which
i
have
summed
up
as
laws
when
the
will
and
the
imagination
are
antagonistic
it
is
always
the
imagination
which
wins
any
in
the
conflict
between
the
will
and
the
imagination
the
force
of
the
imagination
is
in
ratio
to
the
square
of
the
when
the
will
and
the
imagination
are
in
agreement
one
does
not
add
to
the
other
but
one
is
multiplied
by
the
other
the
imagination
can
be
directed
the
expressions
in
direct
ratio
to
the
square
of
the
will
and
is
multiplied
by
are
not
rigorously
exact
they
are
simply
illustrations
destined
to
make
my
meaning
clearer
after
what
has
just
been
said
it
would
seem
that
nobody
ought
to
be
that
is
quite
true
every
illness
whatever
it
may
be
yield
to
daring
and
unlikely
as
my
statement
may
seem
i
do
not
say
always
but
which
is
a
different
thing
but
in
order
to
lead
people
to
practise
conscious
autosuggestion
they
must
be
taught
how
just
as
they
are
taught
to
read
or
write
or
play
the
piano
is
as
i
said
above
an
instrument
that
we
possess
at
birth
and
with
which
we
play
unconsciously
all
our
life
as
a
baby
plays
with
its
rattle
it
is
however
a
dangerous
instrument
it
can
wound
or
even
kill
you
if
you
handle
it
imprudently
and
unconsciously
it
can
on
the
contrary
save
your
life
when
you
know
how
to
employ
it
one
can
say
of
it
as
aesop
said
of
the
tongue
it
is
at
the
same
time
the
best
and
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
i
am
now
going
to
show
you
how
everyone
can
profit
by
the
beneficent
action
of
consciously
applied
in
saying
every
one
i
exaggerate
a
little
for
there
are
two
classes
of
persons
in
whom
it
is
difficult
to
arouse
conscious
autosuggestion
the
mentally
undeveloped
who
are
not
capable
of
understanding
what
you
say
to
them
who
are
unwilling
to
how
to
teach
patients
to
make
autosuggestions
the
principle
of
the
method
may
be
summed
up
in
these
few
words
is
impossible
to
think
of
two
things
at
that
is
to
say
that
two
ideas
may
be
in
juxtaposition
but
they
can
not
be
superimposed
in
our
mind
thought
entirely
filling
our
mind
becomes
true
for
us
and
tends
to
transform
itself
into
thus
if
you
can
make
a
sick
person
think
that
her
trouble
is
getting
better
it
will
disappear
if
you
succeed
in
making
a
kleptomaniac
think
that
he
will
not
steal
any
more
he
will
cease
to
steal
etc
this
training
which
perhaps
seems
to
you
an
impossibility
is
however
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
it
is
enough
by
a
series
of
appropriate
and
graduated
experiments
to
teach
the
subject
as
it
were
the
a
of
conscious
thought
and
here
is
the
series
by
following
it
to
the
letter
one
can
be
absolutely
sure
of
obtaining
a
good
result
except
with
the
two
categories
of
persons
mentioned
above
ask
the
subject
to
stand
upright
with
the
body
as
stiff
as
an
iron
bar
the
feet
close
together
from
toe
to
heel
while
keeping
the
ankles
flexible
as
if
they
were
hinges
tell
him
to
make
himself
like
a
plank
with
hinges
at
its
base
which
is
balanced
on
the
ground
make
him
notice
that
if
one
pushes
the
plank
slightly
either
way
it
falls
as
a
mass
without
any
resistance
in
the
direction
in
which
it
is
pushed
tell
him
that
you
are
going
to
pull
him
back
by
the
shoulders
and
that
he
must
let
himself
fall
in
your
arms
without
the
slightest
resistance
turning
on
his
ankles
as
on
hinges
that
is
to
say
keeping
the
feet
fixed
to
the
ground
then
pull
him
back
by
the
shoulders
and
if
the
experiment
does
not
succeed
repeat
it
until
it
does
or
nearly
so
these
experiments
are
those
of
sage
of
rochester
begin
by
explaining
to
the
subject
that
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
action
of
the
imagination
upon
us
you
are
going
to
ask
him
in
a
moment
to
think
i
am
falling
backwards
i
am
falling
tell
him
that
he
must
have
no
thought
but
this
in
his
mind
that
he
must
not
reflect
or
wonder
if
he
is
going
to
fall
or
not
or
think
that
if
he
falls
he
may
hurt
himself
or
fall
back
purposely
to
please
you
but
that
if
he
really
feels
something
impelling
him
to
fall
backwards
he
must
not
resist
but
obey
the
impulse
then
ask
your
subject
to
raise
the
head
high
and
to
shut
his
eyes
and
place
your
right
fist
on
the
back
of
his
neck
and
your
left
hand
on
his
forehead
and
say
to
him
now
think
i
am
falling
backwards
i
am
falling
backwards
etc
and
indeed
you
are
falling
backwards
you
are
fall
ing
back
wards
etc
at
the
same
time
slide
the
left
hand
lightly
backwards
to
the
left
temple
above
the
ear
and
remove
very
slowly
but
with
a
continuous
movement
the
right
fist
the
subject
is
immediately
felt
to
make
a
slight
movement
backwards
and
either
to
stop
himself
from
falling
or
else
to
fall
completely
in
the
first
case
tell
him
that
he
has
resisted
and
that
he
did
not
think
just
that
he
was
falling
but
that
he
might
hurt
himself
if
he
did
fall
that
is
true
for
if
he
had
not
thought
the
latter
he
would
have
fallen
like
a
block
repeat
the
experiment
using
a
tone
of
command
as
if
you
would
force
the
subject
to
obey
you
go
on
with
it
until
it
is
completely
successful
or
very
nearly
so
the
operator
should
stand
a
little
behind
the
subject
the
left
leg
forward
and
the
right
leg
well
behind
him
so
as
not
to
be
knocked
over
by
the
subject
when
he
falls
neglect
of
this
precaution
might
result
in
a
double
fall
if
the
person
is
heavy
place
the
subject
facing
you
the
body
still
stiff
the
ankles
flexible
and
the
feet
joined
and
parallel
put
your
two
hands
on
his
temples
without
any
pressure
look
fixedly
without
moving
the
eyelids
at
the
root
of
his
nose
and
tell
him
to
think
i
am
falling
forward
i
am
falling
forward
and
repeat
to
him
stressing
the
syllables
you
are
fall
ing
for
ward
you
are
fall
ing
for
ward
without
ceasing
to
look
fixedly
at
him
ask
the
subject
to
clasp
his
hands
as
tight
as
possible
that
is
to
say
until
the
fingers
tremble
slightly
look
at
him
in
the
same
way
as
in
the
preceding
experiment
and
keep
your
hands
on
his
as
though
to
squeeze
them
together
still
more
tightly
tell
him
to
think
that
he
can
not
unclasp
his
fingers
that
you
are
going
to
count
three
and
that
when
you
say
three
he
is
to
try
to
separate
his
hands
while
thinking
all
the
time
i
can
not
do
it
i
can
not
do
it
and
he
will
find
it
impossible
then
count
very
slowly
one
two
three
and
add
immediately
detaching
the
syllables
you
can
not
do
you
can
not
do
if
the
subject
is
thinking
properly
i
can
not
do
it
not
only
is
he
unable
to
separate
his
fingers
but
the
latter
clasp
themselves
all
the
more
tightly
together
the
more
efforts
he
makes
to
separate
them
he
obtains
in
fact
exactly
the
contrary
to
what
he
wants
in
a
few
moments
say
to
him
now
think
can
do
it
and
his
fingers
will
separate
themselves
be
careful
always
to
keep
your
eyes
fixed
on
the
root
of
the
nose
and
do
not
allow
him
to
turn
his
eyes
away
from
yours
for
a
single
moment
if
he
is
able
to
unclasp
his
hands
do
not
think
it
is
your
own
fault
it
is
the
subject
he
has
not
properly
thought
i
can
not
assure
him
firmly
of
this
and
begin
the
experiment
again
always
use
a
tone
of
command
which
suffers
no
disobedience
i
do
not
mean
that
it
is
necessary
to
raise
your
voice
on
the
contrary
it
is
preferable
to
employ
the
ordinary
pitch
but
stress
every
word
in
a
dry
and
imperative
tone
when
these
experiments
have
been
successful
all
the
others
succeed
equally
well
and
can
be
easily
obtained
by
carrying
out
to
the
letter
the
instructions
given
above
some
subjects
are
very
sensitive
and
it
is
easy
to
recognize
them
by
the
fact
that
the
contraction
of
their
fingers
and
limbs
is
easily
produced
after
two
or
three
successful
experiments
it
is
no
longer
necessary
to
say
to
them
think
this
or
think
that
you
need
only
for
example
say
to
them
simply
but
in
the
imperative
tone
employed
by
all
good
suggestionists
close
your
hands
now
you
can
not
open
them
shut
your
eyes
now
you
can
not
open
them
and
the
subject
finds
it
absolutely
impossible
to
open
the
hands
or
the
eyes
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
tell
him
in
a
few
moments
you
can
do
it
now
and
the
takes
place
instantaneously
these
experiments
can
be
varied
to
infinity
here
are
a
few
more
make
the
subject
join
his
hands
and
suggest
that
they
are
welded
together
make
him
put
his
hand
on
the
table
and
suggest
that
it
is
stuck
to
it
tell
him
that
he
is
fixed
to
his
chair
and
can
not
rise
make
him
rise
and
tell
him
he
can
not
walk
put
a
penholder
on
the
table
and
tell
him
that
it
weighs
a
hundredweight
and
that
he
can
not
lift
it
etc
in
all
these
experiments
i
can
not
repeat
too
often
it
is
not
properly
which
produces
the
phenomena
but
the
which
is
consecutive
to
the
suggestion
of
the
operator
method
of
procedure
in
curative
suggestion
when
the
subject
has
passed
through
the
preceding
experiments
and
has
understood
them
he
is
ripe
for
curative
suggestion
he
is
like
a
cultivated
field
in
which
the
seed
can
germinate
and
develop
whereas
before
it
was
but
rough
earth
in
which
it
would
have
perished
whatever
ailment
the
subject
suffers
from
whether
it
is
physical
or
mental
it
is
important
to
proceed
always
in
the
same
way
and
to
use
the
same
words
with
a
few
variations
according
to
the
case
say
to
the
subject
sit
down
and
close
your
eyes
i
am
not
going
to
try
and
put
you
to
sleep
as
it
is
quite
unnecessary
i
ask
you
to
close
your
eyes
simply
in
order
that
your
attention
may
not
be
distracted
by
the
objects
around
you
now
tell
yourself
that
every
word
i
say
is
going
to
fix
itself
in
your
mind
and
be
printed
engraved
and
encrusted
in
it
that
there
it
is
going
to
stay
fixed
imprinted
and
encrusted
and
that
without
your
will
or
knowledge
in
fact
perfectly
unconsciously
on
your
part
you
yourself
and
your
whole
organism
are
going
to
obey
in
the
first
place
i
say
that
every
day
three
times
a
day
in
the
morning
at
midday
and
in
the
evening
at
the
usual
meal
times
you
will
feel
hungry
that
is
to
say
you
will
experience
the
agreeable
sensation
which
makes
you
think
and
say
oh
how
nice
it
will
be
to
have
something
to
eat
you
will
then
eat
and
enjoy
your
food
without
of
course
overeating
you
will
also
be
careful
to
masticate
it
properly
so
as
to
transform
it
into
a
sort
of
soft
paste
before
swallowing
it
in
these
conditions
you
will
digest
it
properly
and
so
feel
no
discomfort
inconvenience
or
pain
of
any
kind
either
in
the
stomach
or
intestines
you
will
assimilate
what
you
eat
and
your
organism
will
make
use
of
it
to
make
blood
muscle
strength
and
energy
in
a
word
life
since
you
will
have
digested
your
food
properly
the
function
of
excretion
will
be
normal
and
every
morning
on
rising
you
will
feel
the
need
of
evacuating
the
bowels
and
without
ever
being
obliged
to
take
medicine
or
to
use
any
artifice
you
will
obtain
a
normal
and
satisfactory
result
further
every
night
from
the
time
you
wish
to
go
to
sleep
till
the
time
you
wish
to
wake
next
morning
you
will
sleep
deeply
calmly
and
quietly
without
nightmares
and
on
waking
you
will
feel
perfectly
well
cheerful
and
active
likewise
if
you
occasionally
suffer
from
depression
if
you
are
gloomy
and
prone
to
worry
and
look
on
the
dark
side
of
things
from
now
onwards
you
will
cease
to
do
so
and
instead
of
worrying
and
being
depressed
and
looking
on
the
dark
side
of
things
you
are
going
to
feel
perfectly
cheerful
possibly
without
any
special
reason
for
it
just
as
you
used
to
feel
depressed
for
no
particular
reason
i
say
further
still
that
even
if
you
have
real
reason
to
be
worried
and
depressed
you
are
not
going
to
be
so
if
you
are
also
subject
to
occasional
fits
of
impatience
or
you
will
cease
to
have
them
on
the
contrary
you
will
be
always
patient
and
master
of
yourself
and
the
things
which
worried
annoyed
or
irritated
you
will
henceforth
leave
you
absolutely
indifferent
and
perfectly
calm
if
you
are
sometimes
attacked
pursued
haunted
by
bad
and
unwholesome
ideas
by
apprehensions
fears
aversions
temptations
or
grudges
against
other
people
all
that
will
be
gradually
lost
sight
of
by
your
imagination
and
will
melt
away
and
lose
itself
as
though
in
a
distant
cloud
where
it
will
finally
disappear
completely
as
a
dream
vanishes
when
we
wake
so
will
all
these
vain
images
disappear
to
this
i
add
that
all
your
organs
are
performing
their
functions
properly
the
heart
beats
in
a
normal
way
and
the
circulation
of
the
blood
takes
place
as
it
should
the
lungs
are
carrying
out
their
functions
as
also
the
stomach
the
intestines
the
liver
the
biliary
duct
the
kidneys
and
the
bladder
if
at
the
present
moment
any
of
them
is
acting
abnormally
that
abnormality
is
becoming
less
every
day
so
that
quite
soon
it
will
have
vanished
completely
and
the
organ
will
have
recovered
its
normal
function
further
if
there
should
be
any
lesions
in
any
of
these
organs
they
will
get
better
from
day
to
day
and
will
soon
be
entirely
healed
with
regard
to
this
i
may
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
know
which
organ
is
affected
for
it
to
be
cured
under
the
influence
of
the
autosuggestion
every
day
in
every
respect
i
am
getting
better
and
better
the
unconscious
acts
upon
the
organ
which
it
can
pick
out
itself
i
must
also
add
and
it
is
extremely
important
that
if
up
to
the
present
you
have
lacked
confidence
in
yourself
i
tell
you
that
this
will
disappear
little
by
little
and
give
place
to
based
on
the
knowledge
of
this
force
of
incalculable
power
which
is
in
each
one
of
us
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
every
human
being
to
have
this
confidence
without
it
one
can
accomplish
nothing
with
it
one
can
accomplish
whatever
one
likes
within
reason
of
course
you
are
then
going
to
have
confidence
in
yourself
and
this
confidence
gives
you
the
assurance
that
you
are
capable
of
accomplishing
perfectly
well
whatever
you
wish
to
do
condition
that
it
is
and
whatever
it
is
your
duty
to
do
so
when
you
wish
to
do
something
reasonable
or
when
you
have
a
duty
to
perform
always
think
that
it
is
and
make
the
words
impossible
i
can
not
it
is
stronger
than
i
i
can
not
prevent
myself
disappear
from
your
vocabulary
they
are
not
english
what
is
english
is
is
easy
and
i
by
considering
the
thing
easy
it
becomes
so
for
you
although
it
might
seem
difficult
to
others
you
will
do
it
quickly
and
well
and
without
fatigue
because
you
do
it
without
effort
whereas
if
you
had
considered
it
as
difficult
or
impossible
it
would
have
become
so
for
you
simply
because
you
would
have
thought
it
so
to
these
general
suggestions
which
will
perhaps
seem
long
and
even
childish
to
some
of
you
but
which
are
necessary
must
be
added
those
which
apply
to
the
particular
case
of
the
patient
you
are
dealing
with
all
these
suggestions
must
be
made
in
a
monotonous
and
soothing
voice
always
emphasizing
the
essential
words
which
although
it
does
not
actually
send
the
subject
to
sleep
at
least
makes
him
feel
drowsy
and
think
of
nothing
in
particular
when
you
have
come
to
the
end
of
the
series
of
suggestions
you
address
the
subject
in
these
terms
in
short
i
mean
that
from
every
point
of
view
physical
as
well
as
mental
you
are
going
to
enjoy
excellent
health
better
health
than
that
you
have
been
able
to
enjoy
up
to
the
present
now
i
am
going
to
count
three
and
when
i
say
you
will
open
your
eyes
and
come
out
of
the
passive
state
in
which
you
are
now
you
will
come
out
of
it
quite
naturally
without
feeling
in
the
least
drowsy
or
tired
on
the
contrary
you
will
feel
strong
vigorous
alert
active
full
of
life
further
still
you
will
feel
very
cheerful
and
fit
in
every
way
two
three
at
the
word
the
subject
opens
his
eyes
always
with
a
smile
and
an
expression
of
and
contentment
on
his
face
sometimes
though
rarely
the
patient
is
cured
on
the
spot
at
other
times
and
this
is
more
generally
the
case
he
finds
himself
relieved
his
pain
or
his
depression
has
partially
or
totally
disappeared
though
only
for
a
certain
lapse
of
time
in
every
case
it
is
necessary
to
renew
the
suggestions
more
or
less
frequently
according
to
your
subject
being
careful
always
to
space
them
out
at
longer
and
longer
intervals
according
to
the
progress
obtained
until
they
are
no
longer
necessary
that
is
to
say
when
the
cure
is
complete
before
sending
away
your
patient
you
must
tell
him
that
he
carries
within
him
the
instrument
by
which
he
can
cure
himself
and
that
you
are
as
it
were
only
a
professor
teaching
him
to
use
this
instrument
and
that
he
must
help
you
in
your
task
thus
every
morning
before
rising
and
every
night
on
getting
into
bed
he
must
shut
his
eyes
and
in
thought
transport
himself
into
your
presence
and
then
repeat
twenty
times
consecutively
in
a
monotonous
voice
counting
by
means
of
a
string
with
twenty
knots
in
it
this
little
phrase
every
day
in
every
respect
i
am
getting
better
and
better
in
his
mind
he
should
emphasize
the
words
every
which
applies
to
every
need
mental
or
physical
this
general
suggestion
is
more
efficacious
than
special
ones
thus
it
is
easy
to
realize
the
part
played
by
the
giver
of
the
suggestions
he
is
not
a
master
who
gives
orders
but
a
friend
a
guide
who
leads
the
patient
step
by
step
on
the
road
to
health
as
all
the
suggestions
are
given
in
the
interest
of
the
patient
the
unconscious
of
the
latter
asks
nothing
better
than
to
assimilate
them
and
transform
them
into
autosuggestions
when
this
has
been
done
the
cure
is
obtained
more
or
less
rapidly
according
to
circumstances
the
superiority
of
this
method
this
method
gives
absolutely
marvelous
results
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
indeed
by
following
out
my
advice
it
is
impossible
to
fail
except
with
the
two
classes
of
persons
mentioned
above
who
fortunately
represent
barely
per
cent
of
the
whole
if
however
you
try
to
put
your
subjects
to
sleep
right
away
without
the
explanations
and
preliminary
experiments
necessary
to
bring
them
to
accept
the
suggestions
and
to
transform
them
into
autosuggestions
you
can
not
and
will
not
succeed
except
with
peculiarly
sensitive
subjects
and
these
are
rare
everybody
may
become
so
by
training
but
very
few
are
so
sufficiently
without
the
preliminary
instruction
that
i
recommend
which
can
be
done
in
a
few
minutes
formerly
imagining
that
suggestions
could
only
be
given
during
sleep
i
always
tried
to
put
my
patient
to
sleep
but
on
discovering
that
it
was
not
indispensable
i
left
off
doing
it
in
order
to
spare
him
the
dread
and
uneasiness
he
almost
always
experiences
when
he
is
told
that
he
is
going
to
be
sent
to
sleep
and
which
often
makes
him
offer
in
spite
of
himself
an
involuntary
resistance
if
on
the
contrary
you
tell
him
that
you
are
not
going
to
put
him
to
sleep
as
there
is
no
need
to
do
so
you
gain
his
confidence
he
listens
to
you
without
fear
or
any
ulterior
thought
and
it
often
happens
if
not
the
first
time
anyhow
very
soon
that
soothed
by
the
monotonous
sound
of
your
voice
he
falls
into
a
deep
sleep
from
which
he
awakes
astonished
at
having
slept
at
all
if
there
are
sceptics
among
you
as
i
am
quite
sure
there
are
all
i
have
to
say
to
them
is
come
to
my
house
and
see
what
is
being
done
and
you
will
be
convinced
by
fact
you
must
not
however
run
away
with
the
idea
that
autosuggestion
can
only
be
brought
about
in
the
way
i
have
described
it
is
possible
to
make
suggestions
to
people
without
their
knowledge
and
without
any
preparation
for
instance
if
a
doctor
who
by
his
title
alone
has
a
suggestive
influence
on
his
patient
tells
him
that
he
can
do
nothing
for
him
and
that
his
illness
is
incurable
he
provokes
in
the
mind
of
the
latter
an
autosuggestion
which
may
have
the
most
disastrous
consequences
if
however
he
tells
him
that
his
illness
is
a
serious
one
it
is
true
but
that
with
care
time
and
patience
he
can
be
cured
he
sometimes
and
even
often
obtains
results
which
will
surprise
him
here
is
another
example
if
a
doctor
after
examining
his
patient
writes
a
prescription
and
gives
it
to
him
without
any
comment
the
remedies
prescribed
will
not
have
much
chance
of
succeeding
if
on
the
other
hand
he
explains
to
his
patient
that
such
and
such
medicines
must
be
taken
in
such
and
such
conditions
and
that
they
will
produce
certain
results
those
results
are
practically
certain
to
be
brought
about
if
in
this
hall
there
are
medical
men
or
brother
chemists
i
hope
they
will
not
think
me
their
enemy
i
am
on
the
contrary
their
best
friend
on
the
one
hand
i
should
like
to
see
the
theoretical
and
practical
study
of
suggestion
on
the
syllabus
of
the
medical
schools
for
the
great
benefit
of
the
sick
and
of
the
doctors
themselves
and
on
the
other
hand
in
my
opinion
every
time
that
a
patient
goes
to
see
his
doctor
the
latter
should
order
him
one
or
even
several
medicines
even
if
they
are
not
necessary
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
a
patient
visits
his
doctor
it
is
in
order
to
be
told
what
medicine
will
cure
him
he
does
not
realize
that
it
is
the
hygiene
and
regimen
which
do
this
and
he
attaches
little
importance
to
them
it
is
a
medicine
that
he
wants
in
my
opinion
if
the
doctor
only
prescribes
a
regimen
without
any
medicine
his
patient
will
be
dissatisfied
he
will
say
that
he
took
the
trouble
to
consult
him
for
nothing
and
often
goes
to
another
doctor
it
seems
to
me
then
that
the
doctor
should
always
prescribe
medicines
to
his
patient
and
as
much
as
possible
medicines
made
up
by
himself
rather
than
the
standard
remedies
so
much
advertised
and
which
owe
their
only
value
to
the
advertisement
the
own
prescriptions
will
inspire
infinitely
more
confidence
than
so
and
so
pills
which
anyone
can
procure
easily
at
the
nearest
drug
store
without
any
need
of
a
prescription
how
suggestion
works
in
order
to
understand
properly
the
part
played
by
suggestion
or
rather
by
autosuggestion
it
is
enough
to
know
that
the
self
is
the
grand
director
of
all
our
make
this
believed
as
i
said
above
that
a
certain
organ
which
does
not
function
well
must
perform
its
function
and
instantly
the
order
is
transmitted
the
organ
obeys
with
docility
and
either
at
once
or
little
by
little
performs
its
functions
in
a
normal
manner
this
explains
simply
and
clearly
how
by
means
of
suggestion
one
can
stop
haemorrhages
cure
constipation
cause
fibrous
tumours
to
disappear
cure
paralysis
tubercular
lesions
varicose
ulcers
etc
let
us
take
for
example
a
case
of
dental
haemorrhage
which
i
had
the
opportunity
of
observing
in
the
consulting
room
of
gauthé
a
dentist
at
troyes
a
young
lady
whom
i
had
helped
to
cure
herself
of
asthma
from
which
she
had
suffered
for
eight
years
told
me
one
day
that
she
wanted
to
have
a
tooth
out
as
i
knew
her
to
be
very
sensitive
i
offered
to
make
her
feel
nothing
of
the
operation
she
naturally
accepted
with
pleasure
and
we
made
an
appointment
with
the
dentist
on
the
day
we
had
arranged
we
presented
ourselves
at
the
dentist
and
standing
opposite
my
patient
i
looked
fixedly
at
her
saying
you
feel
nothing
you
feel
nothing
etc
and
then
while
still
continuing
the
suggestion
i
made
a
sign
to
the
dentist
in
an
instant
the
tooth
was
out
without
mlle
d
turning
a
hair
as
fairly
often
happens
a
haemorrhage
followed
but
i
told
the
dentist
that
i
would
try
suggestion
without
his
using
a
haemostatic
without
knowing
beforehand
what
would
happen
i
then
asked
mlle
d
to
look
at
me
fixedly
and
i
suggested
to
her
that
in
two
minutes
the
haemorrhage
would
cease
of
its
own
accord
and
we
waited
the
patient
spat
blood
again
once
or
twice
and
then
ceased
i
told
her
to
open
her
mouth
and
we
both
looked
and
found
that
a
clot
of
blood
had
formed
in
the
dental
cavity
how
is
this
phenomenon
to
be
explained
in
the
simplest
way
under
the
influence
of
the
idea
the
haemorrhage
is
to
stop
the
unconscious
had
sent
to
the
small
arteries
and
veins
the
order
to
stop
the
flow
of
blood
and
obediently
they
contracted
as
they
would
have
done
artificially
at
the
contact
of
a
haemostatic
like
adrenalin
for
example
the
same
reasoning
explains
how
a
fibrous
tumour
can
be
made
to
disappear
the
unconscious
having
accepted
the
idea
it
is
to
go
the
brain
orders
the
arteries
which
nourish
it
to
contract
they
do
so
refusing
their
services
and
ceasing
to
nourish
the
tumour
which
deprived
of
nourishment
dies
dries
up
is
reabsorbed
and
disappears
the
use
of
suggestion
for
the
cure
of
moral
ailments
and
taints
either
congenital
or
acquired
neurasthenia
so
common
nowadays
generally
yields
to
suggestion
constantly
practised
in
the
way
i
have
indicated
i
have
had
the
happiness
of
contributing
to
the
cure
of
a
large
number
of
neurasthenics
with
whom
every
other
treatment
had
failed
one
of
them
had
even
spent
a
month
in
a
special
establishment
at
luxemburg
without
obtaining
any
improvement
in
six
weeks
he
was
completely
cured
and
he
is
now
the
happiest
man
one
would
wish
to
find
after
having
thought
himself
the
most
miserable
neither
is
he
ever
likely
to
fall
ill
again
in
the
same
way
for
i
showed
him
how
to
make
use
of
conscious
autosuggestion
and
he
does
it
marvelously
well
but
if
suggestion
is
useful
in
treating
moral
complaints
and
physical
ailments
may
it
not
render
still
greater
services
to
society
in
turning
into
honest
folks
the
wretched
children
who
people
our
reformatories
and
who
only
leave
them
to
enter
the
army
of
crime
let
no
one
tell
me
it
is
impossible
the
remedy
exists
and
i
can
prove
it
i
will
quote
the
two
following
cases
which
are
very
characteristic
but
here
i
must
insert
a
few
remarks
in
parenthesis
to
make
you
understand
the
way
in
which
suggestion
acts
in
the
treatment
of
moral
taints
i
will
use
the
following
comparison
suppose
our
brain
is
a
plank
in
which
are
driven
nails
which
represent
the
ideas
habits
and
instincts
which
determine
our
actions
if
we
find
that
there
exists
in
a
subject
a
bad
idea
a
bad
habit
a
bad
instinct
as
it
were
a
bad
nail
we
take
another
which
is
the
good
idea
habit
or
instinct
place
it
on
top
of
the
bad
one
and
give
a
tap
with
a
hammer
in
other
words
we
make
a
suggestion
the
new
nail
will
be
driven
in
perhaps
a
fraction
of
an
inch
while
the
old
one
will
come
out
to
the
same
extent
at
each
fresh
blow
with
the
hammer
that
is
to
say
at
each
fresh
suggestion
the
one
will
be
driven
in
a
fraction
further
and
the
other
will
be
driven
out
the
same
amount
until
after
a
certain
number
of
blows
the
old
nail
will
come
out
completely
and
be
replaced
by
the
new
one
when
this
substitution
has
been
made
the
individual
obeys
it
let
us
return
to
our
examples
little
m
a
child
of
eleven
living
at
troyes
was
subject
night
and
day
to
certain
accidents
inherent
to
early
infancy
he
was
also
a
kleptomaniac
and
of
course
untruthful
into
the
bargain
at
his
mother
request
i
treated
him
by
suggestion
after
the
first
visit
the
accidents
ceased
by
day
but
continued
at
night
little
by
little
they
became
less
frequent
and
finally
a
few
months
afterwards
the
child
was
completely
cured
in
the
same
period
his
thieving
propensities
lessened
and
in
six
months
they
had
entirely
ceased
this
child
brother
aged
eighteen
had
conceived
a
violent
hatred
against
another
of
his
brothers
every
time
that
he
had
taken
a
little
too
much
wine
he
felt
impelled
to
draw
a
knife
and
stab
his
brother
he
felt
that
one
day
or
other
he
would
end
by
doing
so
and
he
knew
at
the
same
time
that
having
done
so
he
would
be
inconsolable
i
treated
him
also
by
suggestion
and
the
result
was
marvelous
after
the
first
treatment
he
was
cured
his
hatred
for
his
brother
had
disappeared
and
they
have
since
become
good
friends
and
got
on
capitally
together
i
followed
up
the
case
for
a
long
time
and
the
cure
was
permanent
since
such
results
are
to
be
obtained
by
suggestion
would
it
not
be
beneficial
i
might
even
say
to
take
up
this
method
and
introduce
it
into
our
reformatories
i
am
absolutely
convinced
that
if
suggestion
were
daily
applied
to
vicious
children
more
than
per
cent
could
be
reclaimed
would
it
not
be
an
immense
service
to
render
society
to
bring
back
to
it
sane
and
well
members
of
it
who
were
formerly
corroded
by
moral
decay
perhaps
i
shall
be
told
that
suggestion
is
a
dangerous
thing
and
that
it
can
be
used
for
evil
purposes
this
is
no
valid
objection
first
because
the
practice
of
suggestion
would
only
be
confided
by
the
patient
to
reliable
and
honest
people
to
the
reformatory
doctors
for
instance
and
on
the
other
hand
those
who
seek
to
use
it
for
evil
ask
no
one
permission
but
even
admitting
that
it
offers
some
danger
which
is
not
so
i
should
like
to
ask
whoever
proffers
the
objection
to
tell
me
what
thing
we
use
that
is
not
dangerous
is
it
steam
gunpowder
railways
ships
electricity
automobiles
aeroplanes
are
the
poisons
not
dangerous
which
we
doctors
and
chemists
use
daily
in
minute
doses
and
which
might
easily
destroy
the
patient
if
in
a
moment
carelessness
we
unfortunately
made
a
mistake
in
weighing
them
out
a
few
typical
cures
this
little
work
would
be
incomplete
if
it
did
not
include
a
few
examples
of
the
cures
obtained
it
would
take
too
long
and
would
also
perhaps
be
somewhat
tiring
if
i
were
to
relate
all
those
in
which
i
have
taken
part
i
will
therefore
content
myself
by
quoting
a
few
of
the
most
remarkable
mlle
m
d
of
troyes
had
suffered
for
eight
years
from
asthma
which
obliged
her
to
sit
up
in
bed
nearly
all
night
fighting
for
breath
preliminary
experiments
show
that
she
is
a
very
sensitive
subject
she
sleeps
immediately
and
the
suggestion
is
given
from
the
first
treatment
there
is
an
enormous
improvement
the
patient
has
a
good
night
only
interrupted
by
one
attack
of
asthma
which
only
lasts
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
a
very
short
time
the
asthma
disappears
completely
and
there
is
no
relapse
later
on
m
a
working
hosier
living
at
near
troyes
paralyzed
for
two
years
as
the
result
of
injuries
at
the
junction
of
the
spinal
column
and
the
pelvis
the
paralysis
is
only
in
the
lower
limbs
in
which
the
circulation
of
the
blood
has
practically
ceased
making
them
swollen
congested
and
discolored
several
treatments
including
the
antisyphilitic
have
been
tried
without
success
preliminary
experiments
successful
suggestion
applied
by
me
and
autosuggestion
by
the
patient
for
eight
days
at
the
end
of
this
time
there
is
an
almost
imperceptible
but
still
appreciable
movement
of
the
left
leg
renewed
suggestion
in
eight
days
the
improvement
is
noticeable
every
week
or
fortnight
there
is
an
increased
improvement
with
progressive
lessening
of
the
swelling
and
so
on
eleven
months
afterwards
on
the
first
of
november
the
patient
goes
downstairs
alone
and
walks
yards
and
in
the
month
of
july
goes
back
to
the
factory
where
he
has
continued
to
work
since
that
time
with
no
trace
of
paralysis
a
g
living
at
troyes
has
long
suffered
from
enteritis
for
which
different
treatments
have
been
tried
in
vain
he
is
also
in
a
very
bad
state
mentally
being
depressed
gloomy
unsociable
and
obsessed
by
thoughts
of
suicide
preliminary
experiments
easy
followed
by
suggestion
which
produces
an
appreciable
result
from
the
very
day
for
three
months
daily
suggestions
to
begin
with
then
at
increasingly
longer
intervals
at
the
end
of
this
time
the
cure
is
complete
the
enteritis
has
disappeared
and
his
have
become
excellent
as
the
cure
dates
back
twelve
years
without
the
shadow
of
a
relapse
it
may
be
considered
as
permanent
g
is
a
striking
example
of
the
effects
that
can
be
produced
by
suggestion
or
rather
by
autosuggestion
at
the
same
time
as
i
made
suggestions
to
him
from
the
physical
point
of
view
i
also
did
so
from
the
mental
and
he
accepted
both
suggestions
equally
well
every
day
his
confidence
in
himself
increased
and
as
he
was
an
excellent
workman
in
order
to
earn
more
he
looked
out
for
a
machine
which
would
enable
him
to
work
at
home
for
his
employer
a
little
later
a
factory
owner
having
seen
with
his
own
eyes
what
a
good
workman
he
was
entrusted
him
with
the
very
machine
he
desired
thanks
to
his
skill
he
was
able
to
turn
out
much
more
than
an
ordinary
workman
and
his
employer
delighted
with
the
result
gave
him
another
and
yet
another
machine
until
g
who
but
for
suggestion
would
have
remained
an
ordinary
workman
is
now
in
charge
of
six
machines
which
bring
him

very
hand

years

is
in

last
stages
of
consumption
and
grows
thinner
daily
in

of
special
nourishment
she
suffers
from
coughing
and
spitting
and
has
difficulty
in
breathing
in

from
all
appearances
she
has
only
a
few
months
to
live
preliminary
experiments
show
great
sensitiveness
and
suggestion
is
followed
by
immediate
improvement
from
the
next
day
the
morbid
symptoms
begin
to
lessen
every
day
the
improvement
becomes
more
marked
the
patient
rapidly
puts
on
flesh
although
she
no
longer
takes
special
nourishment
in
a
few
months
the
cure
is
apparently
complete
this
person
wrote
to
me
on
the
of
january
that
is
to
say
eight
months
after
i
had
left
troyes
to
thank
me
and
to
tell
me
that
although
pregnant
she
was
perfectly
well
i
have
purposely
chosen
these
cases
dating
some
time
back
in
order
to
show
that
the
cures
are
permanent
but
i
should
like
to
add
a
few
more
recent
ones
x
post
office
clerk
at
luneville
having
lost
one
of
his
children
in
january
the
trouble
produces
in
him
a
cerebral
disturbance
which
manifests
itself
by
uncontrollable
nervous
trembling
his
uncle
brings
him
to
me
in
the
month
of
june
preliminary
experiments
followed
by
suggestion
four
days
afterwards
the
patient
returns
to
tell
me
that
the
trembling
has
disappeared
i
renew
the
suggestion
and
tell
him
to
return
in
eight
days
a
week
then
a
fortnight
then
three
weeks
then
a
month
pass
by
without
my
hearing
any
more
of
him
shortly
afterwards
his
uncle
comes
and
tells
me
that
he
has
just
had
a
letter
from
his
nephew
who
is
perfectly
well
he
has
taken
on
again
his
work
as
telegraphist
which
he
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
and
the
day
before
he
had
sent
off
a
telegram
of
words
without
the
least
difficulty
he
could
easily
he
added
in
his
letter
have
sent
off
an
even
longer
one
since
then
he
has
had
no
relapse
y
of
nancy
has
suffered
from
neurasthenia
for
several
years
he
has
aversions
nervous
fears
and
disorders
of
the
stomach
and
intestines
he
sleeps
badly
is
gloomy
and
is
haunted
by
ideas
of
suicide
he
staggers
when
he
walks
like
a
drunken
man
and
can
think
of
nothing
but
his
trouble
all
treatments
have
failed
and
he
gets
worse
and
worse
a
stay
in
a
special
nursing
home
for
such
cases
has
no
effect
whatever
y
comes
to
see
me
at
the
beginning
of
october
preliminary
experiments
comparatively
easy
i
explain
to
the
patient
the
principles
of
autosuggestion
and
the
existence
within
us
of
the
conscious
and
the
unconscious
self
and
then
make
the
required
suggestion
for
two
or
three
days
y
has
a
little
difficulty
with
the
explanations
i
have
given
him
in
a
short
time
light
breaks
in
upon
his
mind
and
he
grasps
the
whole
thing
i
renew
the
suggestion
and
he
makes
it
himself
too
every
day
the
improvement
which
is
at
first
slow
becomes
more
and
more
rapid
and
in
a
month
and
a
half
the
cure
is
complete
the
who
had
lately
considered
himself
the
most
wretched
of
men
now
thinks
himself
the
happiest
e
of
troyes
an
attack
of
gout
the
right
ankle
is
inflamed
and
painful
and
he
is
unable
to
walk
the
preliminary
experiments
show
him
to
be
a
very
sensitive
subject
after
the
first
treatment
he
is
able
to
regain
without
the
help
of
his
stick
the
carriage
which
brought
him
and
the
pain
has
ceased
the
next
day
he
does
not
return
as
i
had
told
him
to
do
afterwards
his
wife
comes
alone
and
tells
me
that
that
morning
her
husband
had
got
up
put
on
his
shoes
and
gone
off
on
his
bicycle
to
visit
his
yards
he
is
a
painter
it
is
needless
to
tell
you
my
utter
astonishment
i
was
not
able
to
follow
up
this
case
as
the
patient
never
deigned
to
come
and
see
me
again
but
some
time
afterward
i
heard
that

had
had
no
relapse

negative
result

treat
her
by
suggestion
and
she
makes
autosuggestions
for
herself
every
day
from
the
first
day
there
is
a
noticeable
improvement
which
continues
without
interruption
at
the
present
moment
this
person
has
long
been
cured
mentally
and
physically
and
follows
no
regimen

thinks
that
she
still
has
perhaps
a
slight
touch
of
enteritis

she
is
not
sure

she
suffers
from
lack

is
cured

permanent
one

and

that
she
feels
quite
well
every
trace
of
illness
has
disappeared
and
all
the
organs
are
functioning
normally
three
or
four
times
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
sweating
but
each
time
prevented
it
by
the
use
of
conscious
autosuggestion

this
time

good
health

at

for
more
than
ten
minutes
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
becoming
completely
aphonous
different
doctors
consulted
find
no
lesion
in
the
vocal
organs
but
one
of
them
says
that
x
suffers
from
senility
of
the
larynx
and
this
conclusion
confirms
him
in
the
belief
that
he
is
incurable
he
comes
to
spend
his
holidays
at
nancy
and
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
advises
him
to
come
and
see
me
he
refuses
at
first
but
eventually
consents
in
spite
of
his
absolute
disbelief
in
the
effects
of
suggestion
i
treat
him
in
this
way
nevertheless
and
ask
him
to
return
two
days
afterwards
he
comes
back
on
the
appointed
day
and
tells
me
that
the
day
before
he
was
able
to
converse
the
whole
afternoon
without
becoming
aphonous
two
days
later
he
returns
again
to
say
that
his
trouble
had
not
reappeared
although
he
had
not
only
conversed
a
great
deal
but
even
sung
the
day
before
the
cure
still
holds
good
and
i
am
convinced
that
it
will
always
do
so
before
closing
i
should
like
to
say
a
few
words
on
the
application
of
my
method
to
the
training
and
correction
of
children
by
their
parents
the
latter
should
wait
until
the
child
is
asleep
and
then
one
of
them
should
enter
his
room
with
precaution
stop
a
yard
from
his
bed
and
repeat
or
times
in
a
murmur
all
the
things
they
wish
to
obtain
from
the
child
from
the
point
of
view
of
health
work
sleep
application
conduct
etc
he
should
then
retire
as
he
came
taking
great
care
not
to
awake
the
child
this
extremely
simple
process
gives
the
best
possible
results
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
when
the
child
is
asleep
his
body
and
his
conscious
self
are
at
rest
and
as
it
were
annihilated
his
unconscious
self
however
is
awake
it
is
then
to
the
latter
alone
that
one
speaks
and
as
it
is
very
credulous
it
accepts
what
one
says
to
it
without
dispute
so
that
little
by
little
the
child
arrives
at
making
of
himself
what
his
parents
desire
him
to
be
conclusion
what
conclusion
is
to
be
drawn
from
all
this
the
conclusion
is
very
simple
and
can
be
expressed
in
a
few
words
we
possess
within
us
a
force
of
incalculable
power
which
when
we
handle
it
unconsciously
is
often
prejudicial
to
us
if
on
the
contrary
we
direct
it
in
a
conscious
and
wise
manner
it
gives
us
the
mastery
of
ourselves
and
allows
us
not
only
to
escape
and
to
aid
others
to
escape
from
physical
and
mental
ills
but
also
to
live
in
relative
happiness
whatever
the
conditions
in
which
we
may
find
ourselves
lastly
and
above
all
it
should
be
applied
to
the
moral
regeneration
of
those
who
have
wandered
from
the
right
path
thoughts
and
precepts
of
emile
coué
down
literally
by
mme
emile
leon
his
do
not
spend
your
time
in
thinking
of
illness
you
might
have
for
if
you
have
no
real
ones
you
will
create
artificial
ones
when
you
make
conscious
autosuggestions
do
it
naturally
simply
with
conviction
and
above
all
any
if
unconscious
and
bad
autosuggestions
are
so
often
realized
it
is
because
they
are
made
without
effort
be
sure
that
you
will
obtain
what
you
want
and
you
will
obtain
it
so
long
as
it
is
within
reason
to
become
master
of
oneself
it
is
enough
to
think
that
one
is
becoming
your
hands
tremble
your
steps
falter
tell
yourself
that
all
that
is
going
to
cease
and
little
by
little
it
will
disappear
it
is
not
in
me
but
in
yourself
that
you
must
have
confidence
for
it
is
in
yourself
alone
that
dwells
the
force
which
can
cure
you
my
part
simply
consists
in
teaching
you
to
make
use
of
that
force
never
discuss
things
you
know
nothing
about
or
you
will
only
make
yourself
ridiculous
things
which
seem
miraculous
to
you
have
a
perfectly
natural
cause
if
they
seem
extraordinary
it
is
only
because
the
cause
escapes
you
when
you
know
that
you
realize
that
nothing
could
be
more
natural
when
the
will
and
the
imagination
are
in
conflict
it
is
always
the
imagination
which
wins
such
a

only
too
frequent
and
then
not
only
do
we
not
do
what
we
want
but
just
the
contrary
of
what
we
want
for
example
the
more
we
try
to
go
to
sleep
the
more
we
try
to
remember
the
name
of
some
one
the
more
we
try
to
stop
laughing
the
more
we
try
to
avoid
an
obstacle
while
that
we
can
not
do
so
the
more
excited
we
become
the
less
we
can
remember
the
name
the
more
uncontrollable
our
laughter
becomes
and
the
more
surely
we
rush
upon
the
obstacle
it
is
then
the
imagination
and
not
the
will
which
is
the
most
important
faculty
of
man
and
thus
it
is
a
serious
mistake
to
advise
people
to
train
their
wills
it
is
the
training
of
their
imaginations
which
they
ought
to
set
about
things
are
not
for
us
what
they
are
but
what
they
seem
this
explains
the
contradictory
evidence
of
persons
speaking
in
all
good
faith
by
believing
oneself
to
be
the
master
of
one
thoughts
one
becomes
so
everyone
of
our
thoughts
good
or
bad
becomes
concrete
materializes
and
becomes
in
short
a
reality
we
are
what
we
make
ourselves
and
not
what
circumstances
make
us
whoever
starts
off
in
life
with
the
idea
i
shall
succeed
always
does
succeed
because
he
does
what
is
necessary
to
bring
about
this
result
if
only
one
opportunity
presents
itself
to
him
and
if
this
opportunity
has
as
it
were
only
one
hair
on
its
head
he
seizes
it
by
that
one
hair
further
he
often
brings
about
unconsciously
or
not
propitious
circumstances
he
who
on
the
contrary
always
doubts
himself
never
succeeds
in
doing
anything
he
might
find
himself
in
the
midst
of
an
army
of
opportunities
with
heads
of
hair
like
absalom
and
yet
he
would
not
see
them
and
could
not
seize
a
single
one
even
if
he
had
only
to
stretch
out
his
hand
in
order
to
do
so
and
if
he
brings
about
circumstances
they
are
generally
unfavorable
ones
do
not
then
blame
fate
you
have
only
yourself
to
blame
people
are
always
preaching
the
doctrine
of
effort
but
this
idea
must
be
repudiated
effort
means
will
and
will
means
the
possible
entrance
of
the
imagination
in
opposition
and
the
bringing
about
of
the
exactly
contrary
result
to
the
desired
one
always
think
that
what
you
have
to
do
is
easy
if
possible
in
this
state
of
mind
you
will
not
spend
more
of
your
strength
than
just
what
is
necessary
if
you
consider
it
difficult
you
will
spend
ten
twenty
times
more
strength
than
you
need
in
other
words
you
will
waste
it
autosuggestion
is
an
instrument
which
you
have
to
learn
how
to
use
just
as
you
would
for
any
other
instrument
an
excellent
gun
in
inexperienced
hands
only
gives
wretched
results
but
the
more
skilled
the
same
hands
become
the
more
easily
they
place
the
bullets
in
the
target
conscious
autosuggestion
made
with
confidence
with
faith
with
perseverance
realizes
itself
mathematically
within
reason
when
certain
people
do
not
obtain
satisfactory
results
with
autosuggestion
it
is
either
because
they
lack
confidence
or
because
they
make
efforts
which
is
the
more
frequent
case
to
make
good
suggestions
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
do
it
the
latter
implies
the
use
of
the
which
must
be
entirely
put
aside
one
must
have
recourse
to
the
imagination
many
people
who
have
taken
care
of
their
health
all
their
life
in
vain
imagine
that
they
can
be
immediately
cured
by
autosuggestion
it
is
a
mistake
for
it
is
not
reasonable
to
think
so
it
is
no
use
expecting
from
suggestion
more
than
it
can
normally
produce
that
is
to
say
a
progressive
improvement
which
little
by
little
transforms
itself
into
a
complete
cure
when
that
is
possible
the
means
employed
by
the
healers
all
go
back
to
autosuggestion
that
is
to
say
that
these
methods
whatever
they
are
words
incantations
gestures
staging
all
produce
in
the
patient
the
autosuggestion
of
recovery
every
illness
has
two
aspects
unless
it
is
exclusively
a
mental
one
indeed
on
every
physical
illness
a
mental
one
comes
and
attaches
itself
if
we
give
to
the
physical
illness
the
coefficient
the
mental
illness
may
have
the
coefficient
and
more
in
many
cases
this
can
disappear
instantaneously
and
if
its
coefficient
is
a
very
high
one
for
instance
while
that
of
the
physical
ailment
is
only
this
latter
is
left
a
of
the
total
illness
such
a
thing
is
called
a
miracle
and
yet
there
is
nothing
miraculous
about
it
contrary
to
common
opinion
physical
diseases
are
generally
far
more
easily
cured
than
mental
ones
buffon

the
man
we
would
put
in
that
man
is
what
he
thinks
the
fear
of
failure
is
almost
certain
to
cause
failure
in
the

the

brings
success
and
enables
one
always
to
surmount
the
obstacles
that
may
be
met
with
conviction
is
as
necessary
to
the
suggester
as
to
his
subject
it
is
this
conviction
this
faith
which
enables
him
to
obtain
results
where
all
other
means
have
failed
it
is
not
the
person

acts
it
is
the
method
contrary

autosuggestion
can
bring
about
the
cure
of

formerly
it
was
believed
that
hypnotism
could
only
be
applied
to
the
treatment
of
nervous
illnesses
its
domain
is
far
greater
than
that
it
is
true
that
hypnotism
acts
through
the
intermediary
of
the
nervous
system
but
the
nervous
system
dominates
the
whole
organism
the
muscles
are
set
in
movement
by
the
nerves
the
nerves
regulate
the
circulation
by
their
direct
action
on
the
heart
and
by
their
action
on
the
blood
vessels
which
they
dilate
or
contract
the
nerves
act
then
on
all
the
organs
and
by
their
intermediation
all
the
unhealthy
organs
may

serious

complaint
characterized
by
a
peculiarity
in

respiration
he
has
such
difficulty
in
breathing
that
he
can
only
take
very
slow
and
short
steps
the

attends
him

best
practitioners
predicts
a
rapid
and
fatal
issue
the
invalid
leaves
the
hospital
in
february
a
friend
of
his
family
brings
him
to
me
and
when
i
see
him
i
regard
him
as
a
hopeless
case
but
nevertheless
i
make
him
pass
through
the
preliminary
experiments
which
are
marvelously
successful
after
having
made
him
a
suggestion
and
advised
him
to
do
the
same
thing
for
himself
i
tell
him
to
come
back
in
two
days
when
he
does
so
i
notice
to
my
astonishment
a
improvement
in
his
respiration
and
his
walking
i
renew
the
suggestion
and
two
days
afterwards
when
he
returns
the
improvement
has
continued
and
so
it
is
at
every
visit
so
rapid
is
the
progress
that
he
makes

three
weeks

and
almost
normally
he
can
walk
without
getting
out

breath
and
can
mount

was
impossible
for
him

the
improvement
is
steadily
maintained

can
go

i
advise
him
to
do
so
and
he
goes
off
but
sends
me
news
of
himself
from
time
to
time
his
health
is
becoming
better
and
better
he
has
a

digests

assimilates
his
food
well
and
the
feeling

has

can
he
walk

he
even

she
has
suffered
all
her
life

a
few
visits
they
vanish
completely
two
months
afterwards
she
realized
that
she
was
also
cured
of
a
prolapse
of
the
uterus
which
she
had
not
mentioned
to
me
and
of
which
she
was
not
thinking
when
she
made
her
autosuggestion
this
result
is
due

the
words
in
every
respect
contained
in
the
formula
used

and

rheumatic
pains
in

for
years

years
ago

had
a
more
violent
attack
than
usual
the
leg
swells
as
well
as

then
the
lower
part
of

atrophies
and
the

painfully

for

coué
education
as
it
ought
to
be
it
may
seem
paradoxical
but
nevertheless
the
education
of
a
child
ought
to
begin
before
its
birth
in
sober
truth
if
a
woman
a
few
weeks
after
conception
makes
a
mental
picture
of
the
sex
of
the
child
she
is
going
to
bring
forth
into
the
world
of
the
physical
and
moral
qualities
with
which
she
desires
to
see
it
endowed
and
if
she
will
continue
during
the
time
of
gestation
to
impress
on
herself
the
same
mental
image
the
child
will
have
the
sex
and
qualities
desired
spartan
women
only
brought
forth
robust
children
who
grew
to
be
redoubtable
warriors
because
their
strongest
desire
was
to
give
such
heroes
to
their
country
whilst
at
athens
mothers
had
intellectual
children
whose
mental
qualities
were
a
hundredfold
greater
than
their
physical
attributes
the
child
thus
engendered
will
be
apt
to
accept
readily
good
suggestions
which
may
be
made
to
him
and
to
transform
them
into
autosuggestion
which
later
will
influence
the
course
of
his
life
for
you
must
know
that
all
our
words
all
our
acts
are
only
the
result
of
autosuggestions
caused
for
the
most
part
by
the
suggestion
of
example
or
speech
how
then
should
parents
and
those
entrusted
with
the
education
of
children
avoid
provoking
bad
autosuggestions
and
on
the
other
hand
influence
good
autosuggestions
in
dealing
with
children
always
be
and
speak
in
a
gentle
but
firm
tone
in
this
way
they
will
become
obedient
without
ever
having
the
slightest
desire
to
resist
authority
above
all
above
all
avoid
harshness
and
brutality
for
there
the
risk
is
incurred
of
influencing
an
autosuggestion
of
cruelty
accompanied
by
hate
moreover
avoid
carefully
in
their
presence
saying
evil
of
anyone
as
too
often
happens
when
without
any
deliberate
intention
the
absent
nurse
is
picked
to
pieces
in
the
inevitably
this
fatal
example
will
be
followed
and
may
produce
later
a
real
catastrophe
awaken
in
them
a
desire
to
know
the
reason
of
things
and
a
love
of
nature
and
endeavor
to
interest
them
by
giving
all
possible
explanations
very
clearly
in
a
cheerful
tone
you
must
answer
their
questions
pleasantly
instead
of
checking
them
with
what
a
bother
you
are
do
be
quiet
you
will
learn
that
later
never
on
any
account
say
to
a
child
you
are
lazy
and
good
for
nothing
because
that
gives
birth
in
him
to
the
very
faults
of
which
you
accuse
him
if
a
child
is
lazy
and
does
his
tasks
badly
you
should
say
to
him
one
day
even
if
it
is
not
true
there
this
time
your
work
is
much
better
than
it
generally
is
well
done
the
child
flattered
by
the
unaccustomed
commendation
will
certainly
work
better
the
next
time
and
little
by
little
thanks
to
judicious
encouragement
will
succeed
in
becoming
a
real
worker
at
all
costs
avoid
speaking
of
illness
before
children
as
it
will
certainly
create
in
them
bad
autosuggestions
teach
them
on
the
contrary
that
health
is
the
normal
state
of
man
and
that
sickness
is
an
anomaly
a
sort
of
backsliding
which
may
be
avoided
by
living
in
a
temperate
regular
way
do
not
create
defects
in
them
by
teaching
them
to
fear
this
or
that
cold
or
heat
rain
or
wind
etc
man
is
created
to
endure
such
variations
without
injury
and
should
do
so
without
grumbling
do
not
make
the
child
nervous
by
filling
his
mind
with
stories
of
and
for
there
is
always
the
risk
that
timidity
contracted
in
childhood
will
persist
later
it
is
necessary
that
those
who
do
not
bring
up
then
children
themselves
should
choose
carefully
those
to
whom
they
are
entrusted
to
love
them
is
not
sufficient
they
must
have
the
qualities
you
desire
your
children
to
possess
awaken
in
them
the
love
of
work
and
of
study
making
it
easier
by
explaining
things
carefully
and
in
a
pleasant
fashion
and
by
introducing
in
the
explanation
some
anecdote
which
will
make
the
child
eager
for
the
following
lesson
above
all
impress
on
them
that
work
is
essential
for
man
and
that
he
who
does
not
work
in
some
fashion
or
another
is
a
worthless
useless
creature
and
that
all
work
produces
in
the
man
who
engages
in
it
a
healthy
and
profound
satisfaction
whilst
idleness
so
longed
for
and
desired
by
some
produces
weariness
neurasthenia
disgust
of
life
and
leads
those
who
do
not
possess
the
means
of
satisfying
the
passions
created
by
idleness
to
debauchery
and
even
to
crime
teach
children
to
be
always
polite
and
kind
to
all
and
particularly
to
those
whom
the
chance
of
birth
has
placed
in
a
lower
class
than
their
own
and
also
to
respect
age
and
never
to
mock
at
the
physical
or
moral
defects
that
age
often
produces
teach
them
to
love
all
mankind
without
distinction
of
caste
that
one
must
always
be
ready
to
succor
those
who
are
in
need
of
help
and
that
one
must
never
be
afraid
of
spending
time
and
money
for
those
who
are
in
need
in
short
that
they
must
think
more
of
others
than
of
themselves
in
so
doing
an
inner
satisfaction
is
experienced
that
the
egoist
ever
seeks
and
never
finds
develop
in
them
and
teach
that
before
embarking
upon
any
undertaking
it
should
be
submitted
to
the
control
of
reason
thus
avoiding
acting
impulsively
and
after
having
reasoned
the
matter
out
one
should
form
a
decision
by
which
one
abides
unless
indeed
some
fresh
fact
proves
you
may
have
been
mistaken
teach
them
above
all
that
every
one
must
set
out
in
life
with
a
very
definite
idea
that
he
will
succeed
and
that
under
the
influence
of
this
idea
he
will
inevitably
succeed
not
indeed
that
he
should
quietly
remain
expecting
events
to
happen
but
because
impelled
by
this
idea
he
will
do
what
is
necessary
to
make
it
come
true
he
will
know
how
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
or
even
perhaps
of
the
single
opportunity
which
may
present
itself
it
may
be
only
a
single
thread
or
hair
whilst
he
who
distrusts
himself
is
a
constant
guignard
with
whom
nothing
succeeds
because
his
efforts
are
all
directed
to
that
end
such
a
one
may
indeed
swim
in
an
ocean
of
opportunities
provided
with
heads
of
hair
like
absalom
himself
and
he
will
be
unable
to
seize
a
single
hair
and
often
determines
himself
the
causes
which
make
him
fail
whilst
he
who
has
the
idea
of
success
in
himself
often
gives
birth
in
an
unconscious
fashion
to
the
very
circumstances
which
produce
that
same
success
but
above
all
let
parents
and
masters
preach
by
example
a
child
is
extremely
suggestive
let
something
turn
up
that
he
wishes
to
do
and
he
does
it
as
soon
as
children
can
speak
make
them
repeat
morning
and
evening
twenty
times
consecutively
day
by
day
in
all
respects
i
grow
better
which
will
produce
in
them
an
excellent
physical
moral
and
healthy
atmosphere
if
you
make
the
following
suggestion
you
will
help
the
child
enormously
to
eliminate
his
faults
and
to
awaken
in
him
the
corresponding
desirable
qualities
every
night
when
the
child
is
asleep
approach
quietly
so
as
not
to
awaken
him
to
within
about
three
or
four
feet
from
his
bed
stand
there
murmuring
in
a
low
monotonous
voice
the
thing
or
things
you
wish
him
to
do
finally
it
is
desirable
that
all
teachers
should
every
morning
make
suggestions
to
their
pupils
somewhat
in
the
following
fashion
telling
them
to
shut
their
eyes
they
should
say
children
i
expect
you
always
to
be
polite
and
kind
to
everyone
obedient
to
your
parents
and
teachers
when
they
give
you
an
order
or
tell
you
anything
you
will
always
listen
to
the
order
given
or
the
fact
told
without
thinking
it
tiresome
you
used
to
think
it
tiresome
when
you
were
reminded
of
anything
but
now
you
understand
very
well
that
it
is
for
your
good
that
you
are
told
things
and
consequently
instead
of
being
cross
with
those
who
speak
to
you
you
will
now
be
grateful
to
them
moreover
you
will
now
love
your
work
whatever
it
may
be
in
your
lessons
you
will
always
enjoy
those
things
you
may
have
to
learn
especially
whatever
you
may
not
till
now
have
cared
for
moreover
when
the
teacher
is
giving
a
lesson
in
class
you
will
now
devote
all
your
attention
solely
and
entirely
to
what
he
says
instead
of
attending
to
any
silly
things
said
or
done
by
your
companions
and
without
doing
or
saying
anything
silly
yourself
under
these
conditions
as
you
are
all
intelligent
for
children
you
are
all
intelligent
you
will
understand
easily
and
remember
easily
what
you
have
learned
it
will
remain
embedded
in
your
memory
ready
to
be
at
your
service
and
you
will
be
able
to
make
use
of
it
as
soon
as
you
need
it
in
the
same
way
when
you
are
working
at
your
lessons
alone
or
at
home
when
you
are
accomplishing
a
task
or
studying
a
lesson
you
will
fix
your
attention
solely
on
the
work
you
are
doing
and
you
will
always
obtain
good
marks
for
your
lessons
this
is
the
counsel
which
if
followed
faithfully
and
truly
from
henceforth
will
produce
a
race
endowed
with
the
highest
physical
and
moral
qualities
emile
coué
a
survey
of
the
séances
at
the
town
thrills
at
this
name
for
from
every
rank
of
society
people
come
to
him
and
everyone
is
welcomed
with
the
same
benevolence
which
already
goes
for
a
good
deal
but
what
is
extremely
poignant
is
at
the
end
of
the
séance
to
see
the
people
who
came
in
gloomy
bent
almost
hostile
they
were
in
pain
go
away
like
everybody
else
unconstrained
cheerful
sometimes
radiant
they
are
no
longer
in
pain
with
a
strong
and
smiling
goodness
of
which
he
has
the
secret
coué
as
it
were
holds
the
hearts
of
those
who
consult
him
in
his
hand
he
addresses
himself
in
turn
to
the
numerous
persons
who
come
to
consult
him
and
speaks
to
them
in
these
terms
well
madame
and
what
is
your
trouble
oh
you
are
looking
for
two
many
whys
and
wherefores
what
does
the
cause
of
your
pain
matter
to
you
you
are
in
pain
that
is
enough
i
will
teach
you
to
get
rid
of
and
you
monsieur
your
varicose
ulcer
is
already
better
that
is
good
very
good
indeed
do
you
know
considering
you
have
only
been
here
twice
i
congratulate
you
on
the
result
you
have
obtained
if
you
go
on
doing
your
autosuggestions
properly
you
will
very
soon
be
you
have
had
this
ulcer
for
ten
years
you
say
what
does
that
matter
you
might
have
had
it
twenty
and
more
and
it
could
be
cured
just
the
same
and
you
say
that
you
have
not
obtained
any
improvement
do
you
know
why
simply
because
you
lack
confidence
in
yourself
when
i
tell
you
that
you
are
better
you
feel
better
at
once
do
you
why
because
you
have
faith
in
me
just
believe
in
yourself
and
you
will
obtain
the
same
result
oh
madame
not
so
many
details
i
beg
you
by
looking
out
for
the
details
you
create
them
and
you
would
want
a
list
a
yard
long
to
contain
all
your
maladies
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
you
it
is
the
mental
outlook
which
is
wrong
well
make
up
your
mind
that
it
is
going
to
get
better
and
it
will
be
so
it
as
simple
as
the
you
tell
me
you
have
attacks
of
nerves
every
well
from
you
are
going
to
do
what
i
tell
you
and
you
will
cease
to
have
you
have
suffered
from
constipation
for
a
long
time
what
does
it
matter
how
long
it
is
you
say
it
is
forty
years
yes
i
heard
what
you
said
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
you
can
be
cured
you
hear
on
condition
naturally
of
your
doing
exactly
what
i
tell
you
to
do
in
the
way
i
tell
you
to
do
ah
you
have
glaucoma
madame
i
can
not
absolutely
promise
to
cure
you
of
that
for
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
that
does
not
mean
that
you
can
not
be
cured
for
i
have
known
it
to
happen
in
the
case
of
a
lady
of
and
another
of
lorraine
well
mademoiselle
as
you
have
not
had
your
nervous
attacks
since
you
came
here
whereas
you
used
to
have
them
every
day
you
are
cured
come
back
sometimes
all
the
same
so
that
i
may
keep
you
going
along
the
right
lines
the
feeling
of
oppression
will
disappear
with
the
lesions
which
will
disappear
when
you
assimilate
properly
that
will
come
all
in
good
time
but
you
must
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
it
is
the
same
with
oppression
as
with
heart
trouble
it
generally
diminishes
very
suggestion
does
not
prevent
you
from
going
on
with
your
usual
as
for
the
blemish
you
have
on
your
eye
and
which
is
lessening
almost
daily
the
opacity
and
the
size
are
both
growing
less
every
day
to
a
child
in
a
clear
and
commanding
voice
shut
your
eyes
i
am
not
going
to
talk
to
you
about
lesions
or
anything
else
you
would
not
understand
the
pain
in
your
chest
is
going
away
and
you
wo
want
to
cough
any
more
is
curious
to
notice
that
all
those
suffering
from
chronic
bronchitis
are
immediately
relieved
and
their
morbid
symptoms
rapidly
children
are
very
easy
and
very
obedient
subjects
their
organism
almost
always
obeys
immediately
to
suggestion
to
a
person
who
complains
of
fatigue
well
so
do
i
there
are
also
days
when
it
tires
me
to
receive
people
but
i
receive
them
all
the
same
and
all
day
long
do
not
say
i
can
not
help
it
one
can
always
overcome
oneself
idea
of
fatigue
necessarily
brings
fatigue
and
the
idea
that
we
have
a
duty
to
accomplish
always
gives
us
the
necessary
strength
to
fulfill
it
the
mind
can
and
must
remain
master
of
the
animal
side
of
our
nature
the
cause
which
prevents
you
from
walking
whatever
it
is
is
going
to
disappear
little
by
little
every
day
you
know
the
proverb
helps
those
who
help
stand
up
two
or
three
times
a
day
supporting
yourself
on
two
persons
and
say
to
yourself
firmly
kidneys
are
not
so
weak
that
i
can
not
do
it
on
the
contrary
i
can
after
having
said
every
day
in
every
respect
i
am
getting
better
and
better
add
the
people
who
are
pursuing
me
pursue
me
any
more
they
are
not
pursuing
what
i
told
you
is
quite
true
it
was
enough
to
think
that
you
had
no
more
pain
for
the
pain
to
disappear
not
think
then
that
it
may
come
back
or
it
will
come
back
a
woman
sotto
voice
what
patience
he
has
what
a
wonderfully
painstaking
man
all
that
we
think
becomes
true
for
us
we
must
not
then
allow
ourselves
to
think
wrongly
think
my
trouble
is
going
away
just
as
you
think
you
can
not
open
your
hands
the
more
you
say
i
will
not
the
more
surely
the
contrary
comes
about
you
must
say
it
going
away
and
think
it
close
your
hand
and
think
properly
now
i
can
not
open
it
try
she
can
not
you
see
that
your
will
is
not
much
good
to
you
this
is
the
essential
point
of
the
in
order
to
make
you
must
eliminate
the
completely
and
only
address
yourself
to
the
so
as
to
avoid
a
conflict
between
them
in
which
the
will
would
be
vanquished
to
become
stronger
as
one
becomes
older
seems
paradoxical
but
it
is
true
for
diabetes
continue
to
use
therapeutic
treatments
i
am
quite
willing
to
make
suggestions
to
you
but
i
can
not
promise
to
cure
you
i
have
seen
diabetes
completely
cured
several
times
and
what
is
still
more
extraordinary
the
albumen
diminish
and
even
disappear
from
the
urine
of
certain
patients
this
obsession
must
be
a
real
nightmare
the
people
you
used
to
detest
are
becoming
your
friends
you
like
them
and
they
like
you
ah
but
to
and
to
is
not
the
thing
then
after
having
asked
them
to
close
their
eyes
coué
gives
to
his
patients
the
little
suggestive
discourse
which
is
to
be
found
in
self
mastery
when
this
is
over
he
again
addresses
himself
to
each
one
separately
saying
to
each
a
few
words
on
his
case
to
the
first
you
monsieur
are
in
pain
but
i
tell
you
that
from
the
cause
of
this
pain
whether
it
is
called
arthritis
or
anything
else
is
going
to
disappear
with
the
help
of
your
unconscious
and
the
cause
having
disappeared
the
pain
will
gradually
become
less
and
less
and
in
a
short
time
it
will
be
nothing
but
a
moment
to
the
second
person
your
stomach
does
not
function
properly
it
is
more
or
less
dilated
well
as
i
told
you
just
now
your
digestive
functions
are
going
to
work
better
and
better
and
i
add
that
the
dilatation
of
the
stomach
is
going
to
disappear
little
by
little
your
organism
is
going
to
give
back
progressively
to
your
stomach
the
force
and
elasticity
it
had
lost
and
by
degrees
as
this
phenomenon
is
produced
the
stomach
will
return
to
its
primitive
form
and
will
carry
out
more
and
more
easily
the
necessary
movements
to
pass
into
the
intestine
the
nourishment
it
contains
at
the
same
time
the
pouch
formed
by
the
relaxed
stomach
will
diminish
in
size
the
nutriment
will
not
longer
stagnate
in
this
pouch
and
in
consequence
the
fermentation
set
up
will
end
by
totally
disappearing
to
the
third
to
you
mademoiselle
i
say
that
whatever
lesions
you
may
have
in
your
liver
your
organism
is
doing
what
is
necessary
to
make
the
lesions
disappear
every
day
and
by
degrees
as
they
heal
over
the
symptoms
from
which
you
suffer
will
go
on
lessening
and
disappearing
your
liver
then
functions
in
a
more
and
more
normal
way
the
bile
it
secretes
is
alcaline
and
no
longer
acid
in
the
right
quantity
and
quality
so
that
it
passes
naturally
into
the
intestines
and
helps
intestinal
digestion
to
the
fourth
my
child
you
hear
what
i
say
every
time
you
feel
you
are
going
to
have
an
attack
you
will
hear
my
voice
telling
you
as
quick
as
lightning
no
my
friend
you
are
not
going
to
have
that
attack
and
it
is
going
to
disappear
before
it
to
the
fifth
etc
when
everyone
has
been
attended
to
coué
tells
those
present
to
open
their
eyes
and
adds
you
have
heard
the
advice
i
have
just
given
you
well
to
transform
it
into
reality
what
you
must
do
is
this
long
as
you
live
every
morning
before
getting
up
and
every
evening
as
soon
as
you
are
in
bed
you
must
shut
your
eyes
so
as
to
concentrate
your
attention
and
repeat
twenty
times
following
moving
your
that
is
indispensable
and
counting
on
a
string
with
twenty
knots
in
it
the
following
phrase
day
in
every
respect
i
am
getting
better
and
better
there
is
no
need
to
think
of
anything
in
particular
as
the
words
in
every
respect
apply
to
everything
this
autosuggestion
must
be
made
with
confidence
with
faith
with
the
certainty
of
obtaining
what
is
desired
the
greater
the
conviction
of
the
person
the
greater
and
the
more
rapid
will
be
the
results
obtained
further
every
time
that
in
the
course
of
the
day
or
night
you
feel
any
physical
or
mental
discomfort
to
yourself
that
you
will
not
consciously
contribute
to
it
and
that
you
are
going
to
make
it
vanish
then
isolate
yourself
as
much
as
possible
and
passing
your
hand
over
your
forehead
if
it
is
something
mental
or
on
whatever
part
that
is
painful
if
it
is
something
physical
repeat
quickly
moving
the
lips
the
words
it
is
going
it
is
going
etc
as
long
as
it
is
necessary
with
a
little
practice
the
mental
or
physical
discomfort
will
disappear
in
about
to
seconds
begin
again
every
time
it
is
necessary
for
this
as
for
the
other
autosuggestions
it
is
necessary
to
act
with
the
same
confidence
the
same
conviction
the
same
faith
and
above
all
without
effort
coué
also
adds
what
follows
if
you
formerly
allowed
yourself
to
make
bad
autosuggestions
because
you
did
it
unconsciously
now
that
you
know
what
i
have
just
taught
you
you
must
no
longer
let
this
happen
and
if
in
spite
of
all
you
still
do
it
you
must
only
accuse
yourself
and
say
culpa
mea
maxima
culpa
and
now
if
a
grateful
admirer
of
the
work
and
of
the
founder
of
the
method
may
be
allowed
to
say
a
few
words
i
will
say
monsieur
coué
shows
us
luminously
that
the
power
to
get
health
and
happiness
is
within
us
we
have
indeed
received
this
gift
therefore
suppressing
first
of
all
every
cause
of
suffering
or
encouraged
by
ourselves
then
putting
into
practice
the
favorite
maxim
of
socrates
know
thyself
and
the
advice
of
pope
that
i
may
reject
none
of
the
benefits
that
thy
goodness
bestows
upon
me
let
us
take
possession
of
the
entire
benefit
of
autosuggestion
let
us
become
this
very
day
members
of
the
lorraine
society
of
applied
psychology
let
us
make
members
of
it
those
who
may
be
in
our
care
it
is
a
good
deed
to
do
to
them
by
this
means
we
shall
follow
first
of
all
the
great
movement
of
the
future
of
which
coué
is
the
originator
he
devotes
to
it
his
days
his
nights
his
worldly
goods
and
refuses
to
accept
but
hush
no
more
of
this
lest
his
modesty
refuses
to
allow
these
lines
to
be
published
without
alteration
but
above
all
by
this
means
we
shall
know
exactly
the
days
and
hours
of
his
lectures
at
paris
nancy
and
other
towns
where
he
devotedly
goes
to
sow
the
good
seed
and
where
we
can
go
too
to
see
him
and
hear
him
and
consult
him
personally
and
with
his
help
awake
or
stir
up
in
ourselves
the
personal
power
that
everyone
of
us
has
received
of
becoming
happy
and
well
may
i
be
allowed
to
add
that
when
coué
has
charged
an
entrance
fee
for
his
lectures
they
have
brought
in
thousands
of
francs
for
the
disabled
and

the
final
results
of
the
english
secondary
certificate
have
only
been
posted
up
these
two
hours
and
i
hasten
to
tell
you
about
it
at
least
in
so
far
as
it
concerns
myself
i
passed
the
viva
voce
flying
colors
and
scarcely
felt
a
trace
of
the
nervousness
which
used
to
cause
me
such
an
intolerable
sensation
of
nausea
before
the
tests
during
the
latter
i
was
astonished
at
my
own
calm
which
gave
those
who
listened
to
me
the
impression
of
perfect
on
my
part
in
short
it
was
just
the
tests
i
dreaded
most
which
contributed
most
to
my
success
the
jury
placed
me
second
and
i
am
infinitely
grateful
to
you
for
help
which
undoubtedly
gave
me
an
advantage
over
the
other
candidates
etc
the
case
is
that
of
a
young
lady
who
on
account
of
excessive
nervousness
had
failed
in
the
nervousness
having
vanished
under
the
influence
of
autosuggestion
she
passed
successfully
out
of
more
than
competitors

it
is
with
very
great
pleasure
that
i
write
to
thank
you
most
sincerely
for
the
great
benefit
i
have
received
from
your
method
before
i
went
to
you
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
walking
yards
without
being
out
of
breath
whereas
now
i
can
go
miles
without
fatigue
several
times
a
day
and
quite
easily
i
am
able
to
walk
in
minutes
from
the
rue

to
the
rue
des
glacis
that
is
to
say
nearly
four
kilometers
the
asthma
from
which
i
suffered
has
almost
entirely
disappeared

most
gratefully
paul

i
do
not
know
how
to
thank
you
thanks
to
you
i
can
say
that
i
am
almost
entirely
cured
and
i
was
only
waiting
to
be
so
in
order
to
express
my
gratitude
i
was
suffering
from
two
varicose
ulcers
one
on
each
foot
that
on
the
right
foot
which
was
big
as
my
hand
is
entirely
it
seemed
to
disappear
by
magic
for
weeks
i
had
been
confined
to
my
bed
but
almost
immediately
after
i
received
your
letter
the
ulcer
healed
over
so
that
i
could
get
up
that
on
the
left
foot
is
not
yet
absolutely
healed
but
will
soon
be
so
night
and
morning
i
do
and
always
shall
recite
the
prescribed
formula
in
which
i
have
entire
confidence
i
may
say
also
that
my
legs
were
as
hard
as
a
stone
and
i
could
not
bear
the
slightest
touch
now
i
can
press
them
without
the
least
pain
and
i
can
walk
once
more
which
is
the
greatest
joy

may
n
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
this
lady
never
saw
coué
and
that
it
is
only
thanks
to
a
letter
he
wrote
her
on
april
that
she
obtained
the
result
announced
in
her
letter
of
may
i
am
writing
to
express
my
gratitude
for
thanks
to
you
i
have
escaped
the
risk
of
an
operation
which
is
always
a
very
dangerous
one
i
can
say
more
you
have
saved
my
life
for
your
method
of
autosuggestion
has
done
alone
what
all
the
medicines
and
treatments
ordered
for
the
terrible
intestinal
obstruction
from
which
i
suffered
for
days
had
failed
to
do
from
the
moment
when
i
followed
your
instructions
and
applied
your
excellent
principles
my
functions
have
accomplished
themselves
quite
naturally

do
not
know
how
to
thank
you
for
my
happiness
in
being
cured
for
more
than
years
i
had
suffered
from
attacks
of
asthma
which
caused
the
most
painful
suffocations
every
night
thanks
to
your
splendid
method
and
above
all
since
i
was
present
at
one
of
your
séances
the
attacks
have
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
it
is
a
real
miracle
for
the
various
doctors
who
attended
me
all
declared
that
there
was
no
cure
for
asthma
mme
v
i
am
writing
to
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
for
having
brought
to
my
knowledge
a
new
therapeutic
method
a
marvellous
instrument
which
seems
to
act
like
the
magic
wand
of
a
fairy
since
thanks
to
the
simplest
means
it
brings
about
the
most
extraordinary
results
from
the
first
i
was
extremely
interested
in
your
experiments
and
after
my
own
personal
success
with
your
method
i
began
ardently
to
apply
it
as
i
have
become
an
enthusiastic
supporter
of

for
years
i
have
suffered
from
prolapse
of
the
uterus
i
have
used
your
method
of
autosuggestion
for
the
last
five
months
and
am
now
completely
cured
for
which
i
do
not
know
how
to
thank
you
enough

i
have
suffered
terribly
for
years
without
respite
every
night
i
had
attacks
of
asthma
and
suffered
also
from
insomnia
and
general
weakness
which
prevented
any
occupation
mentally
i
was
depressed
restless
worried
and
was
inclined
to
make
mountains
out
of
mole

i
had
followed
many
treatments
without
success
having
even
undergone
in

the
removal
of
the
turbinate
bone
of
the
nose
without
obtaining
any
relief
in
i
became
worse

a
great
sorrow

was
at

was
an
officer
on
a

lost

was
a
delightful
child
of

who
was
the
joy
of
our
life
alone
and
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
i
reproached
myself
bitterly
for
not
having
been
able
to
protect
and
save
our
treasure
i
wanted
to
lose
my
reason
or
to
when
my

returned
which
was
not
until
february
he
took
me
to
a
new
doctor
who
ordered
me
various
remedies
and
the
waters
of
i
spent
the
month
of
august
in
that
station
but
on
my
return
i
had
a
recurrence
of
the
asthma
and
i
realized
with
despair
that
in
every
respect
i
was
getting
worse
and
worse
it
was
then
that
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
without
expecting
much
good
from
it
i
must
say
i
went
to
your
october
lectures
and
i
am
happy
to
tell
you
that
by
the
end
of
november
i
was
cured
insomnia
feelings
of
oppression
gloomy
thoughts
disappeared
as
though
by
magic
and
i
am
now
well
and
strong
and
full
of
courage
with
physical
health
i
have
recovered
my
mental
equilibrium
and
but
for
the
ineffaceable
wound
caused
by
my
child
loss
i
could
say
that
i
am
perfectly
happy
why
did
i
not
meet
you
before
my
child
would
have
known
a
cheerful
and
courageous
mother
thank
you
again
and
again
coué
yours
most
gratefully

i
can
now
take
up
again
the
struggle
i
have
sustained
for
years
and
which
had
exhausted
me
i
found
in
you
last
august
a
wonderful
and
providential
help
coming
home
to
lorraine
for
a
few
days
ill
and
with
my
heart
full
of
sorrow
i
dreaded
the
shock
which
i
should
feel
at
the
sight
of
the
ruins
and
distress
and
went
away
comforted
and
in
good
health
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
tether
and
unfortunately
i
am
not
religious
i
longed
to
find
some
one
who
could
help
me
and
meeting
you
by
chance
at
my
cousin
house
you
gave
me
the
very
help
i
sought
i
can
now
work
in
a
new
spirit
i
suggest
to
my
unconscious
to
my
physical
equilibrium
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
i
shall
regain
my
former
good
health
a
very
noticeable
improvement
has
already
shown
itself
and
you
will
better
understand
my
gratitude
when
i
tell
you
that
suffering
from
diabetes
with
a
renal
complication
i
have
had
several
attacks
of
glaucoma
but
my
eyes
are
now
recovering
their
suppleness

become

improved

the
congratulations
of

a
large

belongs
to

regretted
that
you
were
not

hear
your
name
referred
to
with
warm
and
sympathetic
interest
by
the
distinguished
jury
you

been
flung
wide

personally
benefited
by
your

have
made
my

do
so

try
to
apply
your

and
have
already
obtained
visible
results

way

i
have
received
your
kind
letter
as
well
as
your
very
interesting
lecture
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
make
a
rational
connection
between
hetero
and
autosuggestion
and
i
note
particularly
the
passage
in
which
you
say
that
the
will
must
not
intervene
in
autosuggestion
that
is
what
a
great
number
of
professors
of
autosuggestion
unfortunately
including
a
large
number
of
medical
men
do
not
realize
at
all
i
also
think
that
an
absolute
distinction
should
be
established
between
autosuggestion
and
the
training
of
the
will

grateful

are
more
and
more
efficacious

never
spend
a
day

better

i
am

that
you
would
find
it
difficult
to
recognize
in

so
active

of
her
years
the
poor

who
was
so
often
ailing

your
booklet

interested
us
very
much
it
would
be
desirable
for
the
good
of
humanity
that
they
should
be
published
in
several
languages
so
that
they
might
penetrate
to
every
race
and
country
and
thus
reach
a
greater
number
of
unfortunate
people
who
suffer
from
the
wrong
use
of
that
and
almost
divine
faculty
the
most
important
to
man
as
you
affirm
and
prove
so
luminously
and
judiciously
which
we
call
the
imagination
i
had
already
read
many
books
on

and
had
quite
an
arsenal
of
formulae

aphorisms

your
phrases
are
conclusive
i
do
not
think

ever
before
have
compressed
tablets
of

been
condensed

an
intelligent

became

doctors
declared
that
a
new
operation
was
necessary
they
were
about
to
open
my
leg
from

knee
to

ankle

if
the
operation
had
failed

would
have
had

perform

told

would
assure
me
of

good

disciplining

in
associating

has
gone

wonderful

clear
so
simple
so
beneficent

transformed

suffered
terribly

period
and
was
obliged
to
lie
in

now
all
is
quite
regular
and
painless

is

with

digestion
and

live

used

more
pain
which
is
a
joy

is
astonished
to
find
that
when

travel
i
have
no
more
headaches
whereas
before
i
was
always
taking
tablets
now
thanks
to
you
i
need
no
remedies
at
all
but
i
do
not
forget
to
repeat
times
morning
and
evening
the
phrase
you
taught
me
every
day
in
every
respect
i
am
getting
better
and
better
p
october
in
the
method
i
find
it
more
and
more
superior
to
all
the
developments
inspired
by
it
it
surpasses
all
that
has
been
invented
of
scientific
systems
themselves
based
on
the
uncertain
results
of
an
uncertain
science
which
feels
its
way
and
deceives
itself
and
of
which
the
means
of
observation
are
also
fairly
precarious
in
spite
of
what
the
learned
say
coué
on
the
other
hand
suffices
for
everything
goes
straight
to
the
aim
attains
it
with
certainty
and
in
freeing
his
patient
carries
generosity
and
knowledge
to
its
highest
point
since
he
leaves
to
the
patient
himself
the
merit
of
this
freedom
and
the
use
of
a
marvellous
power
no
really
there
is
nothing
to
alter
in
this
method
it
is
as
you
so
strikingly
say
a
gospel
to
report
faithfully
his
acts
and
words
and
spread
his
method
that
is
what
must
be
done
and
what
i
shall
do
myself
as
far
as
is
in
any
way
possible
i
am
amazed
at
the
results
that
i
have
obtained
and
continue
to
obtain
daily

the
use
of
the
excellent
method
you
have
taught
me
of
conscious
autosuggestion
i
was
ill
mentally
and
physically
now
i
am
well
and
am
also
nearly
always
cheerful
that
is
to
say
that
my
depression
has
given
way
to
cheerfulness
and
certainly
i
do
not
complain
of
the
change
for
it
is
very
preferable
i
assure
you
how
wretched
i
used
to
be
i
could
digest
nothing
now
i
digest
perfectly
well
and
the
intestines
act
naturally
i
also
used
to
sleep
so
badly
whereas
now
the
nights
are
not
long
enough
i
could
not
work
but
now
i
am
able
to
work
hard
of
all
my
ailments
nothing
is
left
but
an
occasional
touch
of
rheumatism
which
i
feel
sure
will
disappear
like
the
rest
by
continuing
your
good
method
i
can
not

deny

effect

not
to
declare
openly
that
it
is
to
your
method

from
my
heart
for
the
almost
miraculous
recovery
of
one
of
my
patients
seriously
ill
with
tuberculosis
which
caused
him
to
vomit
blood
constantly
and
copiously
his
family
and
myself
were
very
anxious
when
heaven
sent
you
to
him
after
your
first
visit
the
spitting
of
blood
ceased
his
appetite
returned
and
after
a
few
more
visits
made
by
you
to
his
sick
bed
all
the
organs
little
by
little
resumed
their
normal
functions
at
last
one
day
we
had
the
pleasant
surprise
and
joy
of
seeing
him
arrive
at
your
private
séance
where
before
those
present
he
himself
made
the
declaration
of
his
cure
due
to
your
kind
intervention
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
yours
gratefully
and
sympathetically
kettner
borriglione
nice
march
from
day
to
day
i
have
put
off
writing
to
you
to
thank
you
for
the
cure
of
my
little
sylvain
i
was
in
despair
the
doctors
telling
me
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
but
to
try
the
sanitorium
of
arcachon
or
juicoot
near
dunkirk
i
was
going
to
do
so
when
mine
collard
advised
me
to
go
and
see
you
i
hesitated
as
i
felt
sceptical
about
it
but
i
now
have
the
proof
of
your
skill
for
sylvain
has
completely
recovered
his
appetite
is
good
his
pimples
and
his
glands
are
completely
cured
and
what
is
still
more
extraordinary
since
the
first
time
that
we
went
to
see
you
he
has
not
coughed
any
more
not
even
once
the
result
is
that
since
the
month
of
june
he
has
gained
lbs
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
and
i
proclaim
to
everyone
the
benefits
we
have
received
mme
poirson
august
how
can
i
prove
to
you
my
deep
gratitude
you
have
saved
my
life
i
had
a
displaced
heart
which
caused
terrible
attacks
of
suffocation
which
went
on
continually
in
fact
they
were
so
violent
that
i
had
no
rest
day
or
night
in
spite
of
daily
injections
of
morphia
i
could
eat
nothing
without
instant
vomiting
i
had
violent
pains
in
the
head
which
became
all
swollen
and
as
a
result
i
lost
my
sight
i
was
in
a
lamentable
state
and
my
whole
organism
suffered
from
it
i
had
abscesses
on
the
liver
the
doctor
despaired
of
me
after
having
tried
everything
blood
letting
cupping
and
scarifying
poultices
ice
and
every
possible
remedy
without
any
improvement
i
had
recourse
to
your
kindness
on
the
doctor
advice
after
your
first
visits
the
attacks
became
less
violent
and
less
frequent
and
soon
disappeared
completely
the
bad
and
troubled
nights
became
calmer
until
i
was
able
to
sleep
the
whole
night
through
without
waking
the
pains
i
had
in
the
liver
ceased
completely
i
could
begin
to
take
my
food
again
digesting
it
perfectly
well
and
i
again
experienced
the
feeling
of
hunger
which
i
had
not
known
for
months
my
headaches
ceased
and
my
eyes
which
had
troubled
me
so
much
are
quite
cured
since
i
am
now
able
to
occupy
myself
with
a
little
manual
work
at
each
visit
that
you
paid
me
i
felt
that
my
organs
were
resuming
their
natural
functions
i
was
not
the
only
one
to
observe
it
for
the
doctor
who
came
to
see
me
every
week
found
me
much
better
and
finally
there
came
recovery
since
i
could
get
up
after
having
been
in
bed
eleven
months
i
got
up
without
any
discomfort
not
even
the
least
giddiness
and
in
a
fortnight
i
could
go
out
it
is
indeed
thanks
to
you
that
i
am
cured
for
the
doctor
says
that
for
all
that
the
medicines
did
me
i
might
just
as
well
have
taken
none
after
having
been
given
up
by
two
doctors
who
held
out
no
hope
of
cure
here
i
am
cured
all
the
same
and
it
is
indeed
a
complete
cure
for
now
i
can
eat
meat
and
i
eat
a
pound
of
bread
every
day
how
can
i
thank
you
for
i
repeat
it
is
thanks
to
the
suggestion
you
taught
me
that
i
owe
my
life
jeanne
grosjean
personally
the
science
of
autosuggestion
for
i
consider
it
as
entirely
a
rendered
me
great
services
but
truth
compels
me
to
declare
that
if
i
continue
to
interest
myself
particularly
in
it
it
is
because
i
find
in
it
the
means
of
exercising
true
charity
in
when
i
was
present
for
the
first
time
at
coué
lectures
i
confess
that
i
was
entirely
sceptical
before
facts
a
repeated
in
my
presence
i
was
obliged
to
surrender
to
evidence
and
recognize
that
autosuggestion
always
acted
though
naturally
in
different
degrees
on
organic
diseases
the
only
cases
and
those
were
very
rare
in
which
i
have
seen
it
fail
are
nervous
cases
neurasthenia
or
imaginary
illness
there
is
no
need
to
tell
you
again
that
coué
like
yourself
but
even
more
strongly
insists
on
this
point
that
he
never
performs
a
miracle
or
cures
anybody
but
that
he
shows
people
how
to
cure
themselves
i
confess
that
on
this
point
i
still
remain
a
trifle
incredulous
for
if
coué
does
not
actually
cure
people
he
is
a
powerful
aid
to
their
recovery
in
giving
heart
to
the
sick
in
teaching
them
never
to
despair
in
uplifting
them
in
leading
them
higher
than
themselves
into
moral
spheres
that
the
majority
of
humanity
plunged
in
materialism
has
never
reached
the
more
i
study
autosuggestion
the
better
i
understand
the
divine
law
of
confidence
and
love
that
christ
preached
us
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
and
by
giving
a
little
of
one
heart
and
of
one
moral
force
to
help
him
to
rise
if
he
has
fallen
and
to
cure
himself
if
he
is
ill
here
also
from
my
christian
point
of
view
is
the
application
of
autosuggestion
which
i
consider
as
a
beneficial
and
comforting
science
which
helps
us
to
understand
that
as
the
children
of
god
we
all
have
within
us
forces
whose
existence
we
did
not
suspect
which
properly
directed
serve
to
elevate
us
morally
and
to
heal
us
physically
those
who
do
not
know
your
science
or
who
only
know
it
imperfectly
should
not
judge
it
without
having
seen
the
results
it
gives
and
the
good
it
does
believe
me
to
be
your
faithful
admirer
d
november
the
miracle
within
reprinted
from
the
renaissance
politique
littéraire
et
artistique
of
the
of
december
homage
to
emile
coué
in
the
course
of
the
month
of
september
i
opened
for
the
first
time
the
book
of
charles
baudouin
of
geneva
professor
at
the
institute
rousseau
in
that
town
this
work
published
by
the
firm
of
delachaux
and
niestle
rue
paris
is
called
suggestion
et
autosuggestion
the
author
has
dedicated
it
to
emile
coué
the
initiator
and
benefactor
with
deep
gratitude
i
read
it
and
did
not
put
down
the
book
until
i
had
reached
the
end
the
fact
is
that
it
contains
the
very
simple
exposition
of
a
magnificently
humanitarian
work
founded
on
a
theory
which
may
appear
childish
just
because
it
is
within
the
scope
of
everyone
and
if
everyone
puts
it
into
practice
the
greatest
good
will
proceed
from
it
after
more
than
twenty
years
of
indefatigable
work
emile
coué
who
at
the
present
time
lives
at
nancy
where
he
lately
followed
the
work
and
experiments
of
liébault
the
father
of
the
doctrine
of
suggestions
for
more
than
twenty
years
i
say
coué
has
been
occupied
exclusively
with
this
question
but
particularly
in
order
to
bring
his
fellow
creatures
to
cultivate
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
coué
had
attained
the
object
of
his
researches
and
had
disengaged
the
general
and
immense
force
of
autosuggestion
after
innumerable
experiments
on
thousands
of
subjects
showed
the
action
of
the
unconscious
in
organic
this
is
new
and
the
great
merit
of
this
profoundly
modest
learned
man
is
to
have
found
a
remedy
for
terrible
ills
reputed
incurable
or
terribly
painful
without
any
hope
of
relief
as
i
can
not
enter
here
into
long
scientific
details
i
will
content
myself
by
saying
how
the
learned
man
of
nancy
practises
his
method
the
chiselled
epitome
of
a
whole
life
of
patient
researches
and
of
ceaseless
observations
is
a
brief
formula
which
is
to
be
repeated
morning
and
evening
it
must
be
said
in
a
low
voice
with
the
eyes
closed
in
a
position
favourable
to
the
relaxing
of
the
muscular
system
it
may
be
in
bed
or
it
may
be
in
an
easy
chair
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
as
if
one
were
reciting
a
litany
here
are
the
magic
words
every
day
in
every
respect
i
am
getting
better
and
better
they
must
be
said
twenty
times
following
with
the
help
of
a
string
with
twenty
knots
in
it
which
serves
as
a
rosary
this
material
detail
has
its
importance
it
ensures
mechanical
recitation
which
is
essential
while
articulating
these
words
are
registered
by
the
unconscious
one
must
not
think
of
anything
particular
neither
of
one
illness
nor
of
one
troubles
one
must
be
passive
just
with
the
desire
that
all
may
be
for
the
best
the
formula
in
every
respect
has
a
general
effect
this
desire
must
be
expressed
without
passion
without
will
with
gentleness
with
absolute
for
emile
coué
at
the
moment
of
autosuggestion
not
call
in
the
will
in
any
way
on
the
contrary
there
must
be
no
question
of
the
will
at
that
moment
but
the
the
great
motive
force
infinitely
more
active
than
that
which
is
usually
invoked
the
imagination
alone
must
be
brought
into
play
have
confidence
in
yourself
says
this
good
counsellor
believe
firmly
that
all
will
be
well
and
indeed
all
is
well
for
those
who
have
faith
fortified
by
perseverance
as
deeds
talk
louder
than
words
i
will
tell
you
what
happened
to
myself
before
i
had
ever
seen
coué
i
must
go
back
then
to
the
month
of
september
when
i
opened
charles
baudouin
volume
at
the
end
of
a
substantial
exposition
the
author
enumerates
the
cure
of
illnesses
such
as
enteritis
eczema
stammering
dumbness
a
sinus
dating
from
twenty
years
back
which
had
necessitated
eleven
operations
metritis
salpingitis
fibrous
tumours
varicose
veins
lastly
and
above
all
deep
tubercular
sores
and
the
last
stages
of
phthisis
case
of
mme
d
of
troyes
aged
years
who
has
become
a
mother
since
her
cure
case
was
followed
up
but
there
was
no
relapse
all
this
is
often
testified
to
by
doctors
in
attendance
on
the
patients
these
examples
impressed
me
profoundly
was
the
miracle
it
was
not
a
question
of
nerves
but
of
ills
which
medicine
attacks
without
success
this
cure
of
tuberculosis
was
a
revelation
to
me
having
suffered
for
two
years
from
acute
neuritis
in
the
face
i
was
in
horrible
pain
four
doctors
two
of
them
specialists
had
pronounced
the
sentence
which
would
be
enough
of
itself
alone
to
increase
the
trouble
by
its
fatal
influence
on
the
mind
nothing
to
be
done
this
nothing
to
be
done
had
been
for
me
the
worst
of
autosuggestions
in
possession
of
the
formula
every
day
in
every
respect
i
recited
it
with
a
faith
which
although
it
had
come
suddenly
was
none
the
less
capable
of
removing
mountains
and
throwing
down
shawls
and
scarves
bareheaded
i
went
into
the
garden
in
the
rain
and
wind
repeating
gently
i
am
going
to
be
cured
i
shall
have
no
more
neuritis
it
is
going
away
it
will
not
come
back
the
next
day
i
was
cured
and
never
any
more
since
have
i
suffered
from
this
abominable
complaint
which
did
not
allow
me
to
take
a
step
out
of
doors
and
made
life
unbearable
it
was
an
immense
joy
the
incredulous
will
say
it
was
all
nervous
obviously
and
i
give
them
this
first
point
but
delighted
with
the
result
i
tried
the
coué
method
for
an
oedema
of
the
left
ankle
resulting
from
an
affection
of
the
kidneys
reputed
incurable
in
two
days
the
oedema
had
disappeared
i
then
treated
fatigue
and
mental
depression
and
extraordinary
improvement
was
produced
and
i
had
but
one
idea
to
go
to
nancy
to
thank
my
benefactor
i
went
there
and
found
the
excellent
man
attractive
by
his
goodness
and
simplicity
who
has
become
my
friend
it
was
indispensable
to
see
him
in
his
field
of
action
he
invited
me
to
a
popular
séance
i
heard
a
concert
of
gratitude
lesions
in
the
lungs
displaced
organs
asthma
pott
disease
paralysis
the
whole
deadly
horde
of
diseases
were
being
put
to
flight
i
saw
a
paralytic
who
sat
contorted
and
twisted
in
his
chair
get
up
and
walk
coué
had
spoken
he
demanded
confidence
great
immense
confidence
in
oneself
he
said
learn
to
cure
yourselves
you
can
do
so
i
have
never
cured
anyone
the
power
is
within
you
yourselves
call
upon
your
spirit
make
it
act
for
your
physical
and
mental
good
and
it
will
come
it
will
cure
you
you
will
be
strong
and
happy
having
spoken
coué
approached
the
paralytic
you
heard
what
i
said
do
you
believe
that
you
will
walk
yes
very
well
then
get
up
the
woman
got
up
she
walked
and
went
round
the
garden
the
miracle
was
accomplished
a
young
girl
with
pott
disease
whose
vertebral
column
became
straight
again
after
three
visits
told
me
what
an
intense
happiness
it
was
to
feel
herself
coming
back
to
life
after
having
thought
herself
a
hopeless
case
three
women
cured
of
lesions
in
the
lungs
expressed
their
delight
at
going
back
to
work
and
to
a
normal
life
coué
in
the
midst
of
those
people
whom
he
loves
seemed
to
me
a
being
apart
for
this
man
ignores
money
all
his
work
is
gratuitous
and
his
extraordinary
disinterestedness
forbids
his
taking
a
farthing
for
it
i
owe
you
something
i
said
to
him
i
simply
owe
you
no
only
the
pleasure
i
shall
have
from
your
continuing
to
keep
an
irresistible
sympathy
attracts
one
to
this
philanthropist
arm
in
arm
we
walked
round
the
kitchen
garden
which
he
cultivates
himself
getting
up
early
to
do
so
practically
a
vegetarian
he
considers
with
satisfaction
the
results
of
his
work
and
then
the
serious
conversation
goes
on
in
your
you
possess
an
power
it
acts
on
matter
if
we
know
how
to
domesticate
it
the
imagination
is
like
a
horse
without
a
bridle
if
such
a
horse
is
pulling
the
carriage
in
which
you
are
he
may
do
all
sorts
of
foolish
things
and
take
you
to
your
death
but
harness
him
properly
drive
him
with
a
sure
hand
and
he
will
go
wherever
you
like
thus
it
is
with
the
mind
the
imagination
they
must
be
directed
for
our
own
good
autosuggestion
formulated
with
the
lips
is
an
order
which
the
unconscious
receives
it
carries
it
out
unknown
to
ourselves
and
above
all
at
night
so
that
the
evening
autosuggestion
is
the
most
important
it
gives
marvelous
results
when
you
feel
a
physical
pain
add
the
formula
it
is
going
away
very
quickly
repeated
in
a
kind
of
droning
voice
placing
your
hand
on
the
part
where
you
feel
the
pain
or
on
the
forehead
if
it
is
a
mental
distress
for
the
method
acts
very
efficaciously
on
the
mind
after
having
called
in
the
help
of
the
soul
for
the
body
one
can
ask
it
again
for
all
the
circumstances
and
difficulties
of
life
there
also
i
know
from
experience
that
events
can
be
singularly
modified
by
this
process
you
know
it
and
you
will
know
it
better
still
by
reading
baudouin
book
and
then
his
pamphlet
culture
de
la
force
morale
and
then
lastly
the
little
succinct
treatise
written
by
coué
himself
self
mastery
all
these
works
may
be
found
at
coué
if
however
i
have
been
able
to
inspire
in
you
the
desire
of
making
this
excellent
pilgrimage
yourself
you
will
go
to
nancy
to
fetch
the
booklet
like
myself
you
will
love
this
unique
man
unique
by
reason
of
his
noble
charity
and
of
his
love
for
his
fellows
as
christ
taught
it
like
myself
also
you
will
be
cured
physically
and
mentally
life
will
seem
to
you
better
and
more
beautiful
that
surely
is
worth
the
trouble
of
trying
for
some
notes
on
the
journey
of
coué
to
paris
in
october
the
desire
that
the
teachings
of
coué
in
paris
last
october
should
not
be
lost
to
others
has
urged
me
to
write
them
down
putting
aside
this
time
the
numerous
people
physically
or
mentally
ill
who
have
seen
their
troubles
lessen
and
disappear
as
the
result
of
his
beneficent
treatment
let
us
begin
by
quoting
just
a
few
of
his
teachings
why
is
it
that
i
do
not
obtain
better
results
although
i
use
your
method
and
prayer
because
probably
at
the
back
of
your
mind
there
is
an
doubt
or
because
you
make
now
remember
that
efforts
are
determined
by
the
will
if
you
bring
the
will
into
play
you
run
a
serious
risk
of
bringing
the
imagination
into
play
too
but
in
the
contrary
direction
which
brings
about
just
the
reverse
of
what
you
desire
what
are
we
to
do
when
something
troubles
us
when
something
happens
that
troubles
you
at
once
no
that
does
not
trouble
me
at
all
not
in
the
least
the
fact
is
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise
in
short
the
idea
is
to
work
ourselves
up
in
a
good
sense
instead
of
in
a
bad
are
the
preliminary
experiments
indispensable
if
they
are
unacceptable
to
the
pride
of
the
subject
no
they
are
not
indispensable
but
they
are
of
great
utility
for
although
they
may
seem
childish
to
certain
people
they
are
on
the
contrary
extremely
serious
they
do
indeed
prove
three
things
that
every
idea
that
we
have
in
our
minds
becomes
for
us
and
has
a
tendency
to
transform
itself
into
action
that
when
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
imagination
and
the
will
it
is
always
the
imagination
which
wins
and
in
this
case
we
do
exactly
the
of
what
we
wish
to
do
that
it
is
easy
for
us
to
put
into
our
minds
any
effort
the
idea
that
we
wish
to
have
since
we
have
been
able
without
effort
to
think
in
succession
i
can
not
and
then
i
can
the
preliminary
experiments
should
not
be
repeated
at
home
alone
one
is
often
unable
to
put
oneself
in
the
right
physical
and
mental
conditions
there
is
a
risk
of
failure
and
in
this
case
is
shaken
when
one
is
in
pain
one
can
not
help
thinking
of
trouble
do
not
be
afraid
to
think
of
it
on
the
contrary
do
think
of
it
but
to
say
to
it
i
am
not
of
you
if
you
go
anywhere
and
a
dog
rushes
at
you
barking
look
it
firmly
in
the
eyes
and
it
will
not
bite
you
but
if
you
fear
it
if
you
turn
back
he
will
soon
have
his
teeth
in
your
legs
and
if
one
does
a
retreat
go
backwards
how
can
we
realize
what
we
desire
by
often
repeating
what
you
desire
i
am
gaining
assurance
and
you
will
do
so
my
memory
is
improving
and
it
really
does
so
i
am
becoming
absolutely
master
of
myself
and
you
find
that
you
are
becoming
so
if
you
say
the
contrary
it
is
the
contrary
which
will
come
about
what
you
say
persistently
and
very
quickly
to
within
the
domain
of
the
reasonable
of
course
some
testimonies
a
young
lady
to
another
lady
how
simple
it
is
there
is
nothing
to
add
to
it
he
seems
inspired
do
you
not
think
that
there
are
beings
who
radiate
influence
an
eminent
parisian
doctor
to
numerous
doctors
surrounding
him
i
have
entirely
come
over
to
the
ideas
of
m
a
polytechnician
a
severe
critic
thus
defines
coué
he
is
a
yes
he
is
a
power
of
goodness
without
mercy
for
the
bad
autosuggestions
of
the
defeatist
type
but
indefatigably
painstaking
active
and
smiling
to
help
everyone
to
develop
their
personality
and
to
teach
them
to
cure
themselves
which
is
the
characteristic
of
his
beneficent
method
how
could
one
fail
to
desire
from
the
depths
of
one
heart
that
all
might
understand
and
seize
the
good
news
that
coué
brings
it
is
the
awakening
possible
for
everyone
of
the
personal
power
which
he
has
of
being
happy
and
well
it
is
one
consents
the
full
development
of
this
power
which
can
transform
one
life
then
and
is
it
not
quite
rightly
so
it
is
the
strict
duty
and
at
the
same
time
the
happiness
of
those
who
have
been
initiated
to
spread
by
every
possible
means
the
knowledge
of
this
wonderful
method
the
happy
results
of
which
have
been
recognized
and
verified
by
of
persons
to
make
it
known
to
those
who
suffer
who
are
sad
or
who
are
overburdened
to
all
and
to
help
them
to
put
it
into
practice
then
thinking
of
france
triumphant
but
bruised
of
her
defenders
victorious
but
mutilated
of
all
the
physical
and
moral
suffering
entailed
by
the
war
may
those
the
power
the
greatest
power
ever
given
to
man
is
the
power
of
doing
good
socrates
see
that
the
inexhaustible
reservoir
of
physical
and
moral
forces
that
the
method
puts
within
our
reach
may
soon
become
of
all
the
nation
and
through
it
of
humanity
mme
emile
leon
in
paris
of
emile
everything
for
everyone
by
mme
emile
leon
disciple
of
coué
when
one
has
been
able
to
take
advantage
of
a
great
benefit
when
this
benefit
is
within
reach
of
everyone
although
almost
everyone
is
ignorant
of
it
is
it
not
an
urgent
and
absolute
duty
for
those
who
are
initiated
to
make
it
known
to
those
around
them
for
all
can
make
their
own
the
amazing
results
of
the
emile
coué
method
to
drive
away
pain
is
much
but
how
much
more
is
it
to
lead
into
the
possession
of
a
new
life
those
who
last
april
we
had
the
visit
of
emile
coué
at
paris
and
here
are
some
of
his
teachings
question
of
a
theist
i
think
it
is
unworthy
of
the
eternal
to
make
our
obedience
to
his
will
depend
on
what
coué
calls
a
trick
or
mechanical
process
conscious
autosuggestion
whether
we
wish
it
or
not
our
imagination
always
overrules
our
will
when
they
are
in
conflict
we
can
lead
it
into
the
right
path
indicated
by
our
reason
by
employing
the
mechanical
process
that
we
employ
often
to
lead
into
the
wrong
and
the
thoughtful
questioner
says
to
herself
yes
it
is
true
in
this
elevated
sphere
of
thought
conscious
autosuggestion
has
the
power
to
free
us
from
obstacles
by
ourselves
which
might
as
it
were
put
a
veil
between
us
and
god
just
as
a
piece
of
stuff
hanging
in
a
window
can
prevent
the
sun
from
coming
into
a
room
how
ought
one
to
set
about
bringing
those
dear
to
one
who
may
be
suffering
to
make
themselves
good
autosuggestions
which
would
set
them
free
do
not
insist
or
lecture
them
about
it
just
remind
them
simply
that
i
advise
them
to
make
an
autosuggestion
with
the
that
they
will
obtain
the
result
they
want
how
is
one
to
explain
to
oneself
and
to
explain
to
others
that
the
repetition
of
the
same
words
i
am
going
to
it
is
going
away
has
the
power
to
produce
the
effect
and
above
all
so
powerful
an
effect
that
it
is
a
certain
one
the
repetition
of
the
same
words
forces
one
to
think
them
and
when
we
think
them
they
become
true
for
us
and
transform
themselves
into
reality
how
is
one
to
keep
inwardly
the
mastery
of
oneself
to
be
master
of
oneself
it
is
enough
to
think
that
one
is
so
and
in
order
to
think
it
one
should
often
repeat
it
without
making
any
effort
and
outwardly
how
is
one
to
keep
one
liberty
self
mastery
applies
just
as
much
physically
as
mentally
affirmation
it
is
impossible
to
escape
trouble
or
sadness
if
we
do
not
do
as
we
should
it
would
not
be
just
and
autosuggestion
can
not
and
ought
not
to
prevent
very
seriously
and
affirmatively
certainly
and
assuredly
it
ought
not
to
be
so
but
it
is
so
often
at
any
rate
for
a
time
why
did
that
patient
who
has
been
entirely
cured
continually
have
those
terrible
attacks
he
expected
his
attacks
he
feared
them
and
so
he
them
if
this
gentleman
gets
well
into
his
mind
the
idea
that
he
will
have
no
more
attacks
he
will
not
have
any
if
he
thinks
that
he
will
have
them
he
will
indeed
do
so
in
what
does
your
method
differ
from
others
the
differ
not
the
which
rules
us
but
the
that
is
the
basis
the
fundamental
basis
will
you
give
me
a
summary
of
your
method
for
mme
r
who
is
doing
an
important
work
here
is
the
summary
of
the
method
in
a
few
words
contrary
to
what
is
taught
it
is
not
our
will
which
makes
us
act
but
our
imagination
the
unconscious
if
we
often
do
act
as
we
it
is
because
at
the
same
time
we
think
that
we
can
if
it
is
not
so
we
do
exactly
the
reverse
of
what
we
wish
ex
the
more
a
person
with
insomnia
to
sleep
the
more
excited
she
becomes
the
more
we
to
remember
a
name
which
we
think
we
have
forgotten
the
more
it
escapes
us
it
comes
back
only
if
in
your
mind
you
replace
the
idea
i
have
forgotten
by
the
idea
it
will
come
back
the
more
we
strive
to
prevent
ourselves
from
laughing
the
more
our
laughter
bursts
out
the
more
we
to
avoid
an
obstacle
when
learning
to
bicycle
the
more
we
rush
upon
it
we
must
then
apply
ourselves
to
directing
our
which
now
directs
us
in
this
way
we
easily
arrive
at
becoming
masters
of
ourselves
physically
and
morally
how
are
we
to
arrive
at
this
result
by
the
practice
of
conscious
conscious
autosuggestion
is
based
on
this
principle
every
idea
that
we
have
in
our
mind
becomes
true
for
us
and
tends
to
realize
itself
thus
if
we
something
we
can
obtain
it
at
the
end
of
a
more
or
less
long
time
if
we
often
repeat
that
this
thing
is
going
to
come
or
to
disappear
according
to
whether
it
is
a
good
quality
or
a
fault
either
physical
or
mental
everything
is
included
by
employing
night
and
morning
the
general
formula
every
day
every
respect
i
am
getting
better
and
better
for
those
who
are
sad
who
are
in
distress
as
long
as
you
think
i
am
sad
you
be
cheerful
and
in
order
to
think
something
it
is
enough
to
say
without
effort
i
do
think
this
thing
as
to
the
distress
it
will
disappear
however
violent
it
may
be
i
affirm
a
man
arrives
bent
dragging
himself
painfully
along
leaning
on
two
sticks
he
has
on
his
face
an
expression
of
dull
depression
as
the
hall
is
filling
up
coué
enters
after
having
questioned
this
man
he
says
to
him
something
like
this
so
you
have
had
rheumatism
for
years
and
you
can
not
walk
do
be
afraid
not
going
to
last
as
long
as
that
again
then
after
the
preliminary
experiments
shut
your
eyes
and
repeat
very
quickly
indeed
moving
your
lips
the
words
is
going
it
is
going
at
the
same
time
coué
passes
his
hand
over
the
legs
of
the
patient
for
to
seconds
now
you
are
no
longer
in
pain
get
up
and
walk
the
patient
walks
quickly
quicker
more
quickly
still
and
since
you
can
walk
so
well
you
are
going
to
run
run
monsieur
run
the
patient
runs
joyously
almost
as
if
he
had
recovered
his
youth
to
his
great
astonishment
and
also
to
that
of
the
numerous
persons
present
at
the
séance
of
april
clinic
of
dr
berillon
a
lady
declares
my
husband
suffered
from
attacks
of
asthma
for
many
years
he
had
such
difficulty
in
breathing
that
we
feared
a
fatal
issue
his
medical
adviser
x
had
given
him
up
he
was
almost
radically
cured
of
his
attacks
after
only
one
visit
from
coué
a
young
woman
comes
to
thank
coué
with
lively
gratitude
her
doctor
vachet
who
was
with
her
in
the
room
says
that
the
cerebral
anaemia
from
which
she
had
suffered
for
a
long
while
which
he
had
not
succeeded
in
checking
by
the
usual
means
had
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
through
the
use
of
conscious
autosuggestion
another
person
who
had
had
a
fractured
leg
and
could
not
walk
without
pain
and
limping
could
at
once
walk
normally
no
more
pain
no
more
limping
in
the
hall
which
thrills
with
interest
joyful
testimonies
break
out
from
numerous
persons
who
have
been
relieved
or
cured
a
doctor
autosuggestion
is
the
weapon
of
healing
as
to
this
philosopher
who
writes
he
mentions
his
name
he
relies
on
the
of
coué
a
gentleman
a
former
magistrate
whom
a
lady
had
asked
to
express
his
appreciation
exclaims
in
a
moved
tone
i
can
not
put
my
appreciation
into
words
i
think
it
is
admirable
a
woman
of
the
world
excited
by
the
disappearance
of
her
sufferings
oh
coué
one
could
kneel
to
you
you
are
the
merciful
god
another
lady
very
much
impressed
herself
rectifies
no
his
messenger
an
aged
lady
it
is
delightful
when
one
is
aged
and
fragile
to
replace
a
feeling
of
general
ill
health
by
that
of
refreshment
and
general
and
coué
method
can
i
affirm
for
i
have
proved
it
produce
this
happy
result
which
is
all
the
more
complete
and
lasting
since
it
relies
on
the
force
which
is
within
us
a
warmly
sympathetic
voice
calls
him
the
modest
name
he
prefers
to
that
of
master
professor
coué
a
young
woman
who
has
been
entirely
won
over
coué
goes
straight
to
his
aim
attains
it
with
sureness
and
in
setting
free
his
patient
carries
generosity
and
knowledge
to
its
highest
point
since
he
leaves
to
the
patient
himself
the
merit
of
his
liberation
and
the
use
of
a
marvellous
power
a
literary
man
whom
a
lady
asks
to
write
a
little
chef
on
the
beneficent
method
refuses
absolutely
emphasizing
the
simple
words
which
used
according
to
the
method
help
to
make
all
suffering
disappear
it
is
going
away
is
the
he
affirms
and
the
thousands
of
sick
folks
who
have
been
relieved
or
cured
will
not
contradict
him
a
lady
who
has
suffered
much
declares
in
the
i
find
it
more
and
more
superior
to
the
developments
it
has
inspired
there
is
really
nothing
to
take
away
nor
add
to
this
all
that
is
left
is
to
spread
it
i
shall
do
so
in
every
possible
way
and
now
in
conclusion
i
will
say
although
coué
modesty
makes
him
reply
to
everyone
i
have
no
magnetic
fluid
i
have
no
influence
i
have
never
cured
anybody
my
disciples
obtain
the
same
results
as
myself
i
can
say
in
all
sincerity
that
they
tend
to
do
so
instructed
as
they
are
in
the
and
when
in
some
far
distant
future
the
thrilling
voice
of
its
author
called
to
a
higher
sphere
can
no
longer
teach
it
here
below
the
his
work
will
help
in
aiding
comforting
and
curing
thousands
and
thousands
of
human
beings
it
must
be
and
communicated
to
the
entire
world
by
generous
france
for
the
man
of
letters
was
right
and
knew
how
to
illuminate
in
