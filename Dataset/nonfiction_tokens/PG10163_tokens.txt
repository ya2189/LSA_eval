i
some
points
concerning
the
origin
of
islâm
there
are
more
than
two
hundred
million
people
who
call
themselves
after
the
name
of
mohammed
would
not
relinquish
that
name
at
any
price
and
can
not
imagine
a
greater
blessing
for
the
remainder
of
humanity
than
to
be
incorporated
into
their
communion
their
ideal
is
no
less
than
that
the
whole
earth
should
join
in
the
faith
that
there
is
no
god
but
allah
and
that
mohammed
is
allah
last
and
most
perfect
messenger
who
brought
the
latest
and
final
revelation
of
allah
to
humanity
in
allah
own
words
this
alone
is
enough
to
claim
our
special
interest
for
the
prophet
who
in
the
seventh
century
stirred
all
arabia
into
agitation
and
whose
followers
soon
after
his
death
founded
an
empire
extending
from
morocco
to
china
even
those
who
to
my
mind
not
without
gross
exaggeration
would
seek
the
explanation
of
the
mighty
stream
of
humanity
poured
out
by
the
arabian
peninsula
since
over
western
and
middle
asia
northern
africa
and
southern
europe
principally
in
geographic
and
economic
causes
do
not
ignore
the
fact
that
it
was
mohammed
who
opened
the
sluice
gates
it
would
indeed
be
difficult
to
maintain
that
without
his
preaching
the
arabs
of
the
seventh
century
would
have
been
induced
by
circumstances
to
swallow
up
the
empire
of
the
sasanids
and
to
rob
the
byzantine
empire
of
some
of
its
richest
provinces
however
great
a
weight
one
may
give
to
political
and
economic
factors
it
was
religion
islâm
which
in
a
certain
sense
united
the
hitherto
hopelessly
divided
arabs
islâm
which
enabled
them
to
found
an
enormous
international
community
it
was
islâm
which
bound
the
speedily
converted
nations
together
even
after
the
shattering
of
its
political
power
and
which
still
binds
them
today
when
only
a
miserable
remnant
of
that
power
remains
the
aggressive
manner
in
which
young
islâm
immediately
put
itself
in
opposition
to
the
rest
of
the
world
had
the
natural
consequence
of
awakening
an
interest
which
was
far
from
being
of
a
friendly
nature
moreover
men
were
still
very
far
from
such
a
striving
towards
universal
peace
as
would
have
induced
a
patient
study
of
the
means
of
bringing
the
different
peoples
into
close
spiritual
relationship
and
therefore
from
an
endeavour
to
understand
the
spiritual
life
of
races
different
to
their
own
the
christianity
of
that
time
was
itself
by
no
means
averse
to
the
forcible
extension
of
its
faith
and
in
the
community
of
mohammedans
which
systematically
attempted
to
reduce
the
world
to
its
authority
by
force
of
arms
it
saw
only
an
enemy
whose
annihilation
was
to
its
regret
beyond
its
power
such
an
enemy
it
could
no
more
observe
impartially
than
one
modern
nation
can
another
upon
which
it
considers
it
necessary
to
make
war
everything
maintained
or
invented
to
the
disadvantage
of
islâm
was
greedily
absorbed
by
europe
the
picture
which
our
forefathers
in
the
middle
ages
formed
of
mohammed
religion
appears
to
us
a
malignant
caricature
the
rare
theologians
who
before
attacking
the
false
faith
tried
to
form
a
clear
notion
of
it
were
not
listened
to
and
their
merits
have
only
become
appreciated
in
our
own
time
a
vigorous
combating
of
the
prevalent
fictions
concerning
islâm
would
have
exposed
a
scholar
to
a
similar
treatment
to
that
which
fifteen
years
ago
fell
to
the
lot
of
any
englishman
who
maintained
the
cause
of
the
boers
he
would
have
been
as
much
of
an
outcast
as
a
modern
inhabitant
of
mecca
who
tried
to
convince
his
compatriots
of
the
virtues
of
european
policy
and
social
order

two
and
a
half
centuries
ago
a
prominent
orientalist
who
wrote
an
exposition
of
mohammed
teaching
felt
himself
obliged
to
give
an
elaborate
justification
of
his
undertaking
in
his
dedicatio
he
appeals
to
one
or
two
celebrated
predecessors
and
to
learned
colleagues
who
have
expressly
instigated
him
to
this
work
amongst
other
things
he
quotes
a
letter
from
the
leiden
professor
in
which
he
conjures
breitinger
by
the
bowels
of
jesus
christ
per
viscera
jesu
christi
to
give
the
young
man
every
opportunity
to
complete
his
study
of
the
religion
of
mohammed
which
so
far
has
only
been
treated
in
a
senseless
way
as
a
fruit
of
this
study
thinks
it
necessary
to
mention
in
the
first
place
the
better
understanding
of
the
christian
holy
scriptures
by
the
extension
of
our
knowledge
of
oriental
manners
and
customs
besides
such
promotion
of
christian
exegesis
and
apologetics
and
the
improvement
of
the
works
on
general
history
hottinger
himself
contemplated
a
double
purpose
in
his
the
roman
catholics
often
vilified
protestantism
by
comparing
the
reformed
doctrine
to
that
of
mohammedanism
this
reproach
of
hottinger
wished
talionis
lege
to
fling
back
at
the
catholics
and
he
devotes
a
whole
chapter
cap
of
his
book
to
the
demonstration
that
bellarminius
proofs
of
the
truth
of
the
church
doctrine
might
have
been
copied
from
the
moslim
dogma
in
the
second
place
conforming
to
the
spirit
of
the
times
he
wished
just
as
bibliander
had
done
in
his
refutation
of
the
qorân
to
combine
the
combat
against
mohammedan
unbelief
with
that
against
the
turkish
empire
in
oppugnationem
mahometanae
perfidiae
et
turcici
regni
footnote
hottinger
zürich
edition
the
turks
were
feared
by
the
europe
of
that
time
and
the
significance
of
their
religion
for
their
worldly
power
was
well
known
thus
the
political
side
of
the
question
gave
hottinger
work
a
special
claim
to
consideration
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
hottinger
feared
that
his
labour
would
be
regarded
as
useless
or
even
wicked
especially
when
he
is
obliged
to
say
anything
favourable
of
mohammed
and
his
followers
he
thinks
it
necessary
to
protect
himself
against
misconstruction
by
the
addition
of
some
selected
terms
of
abuse
when
mentioning
mohammed
name
he
says
at
the
mention
of
whom
the
mind
shudders

the
learned
abbé
maracci
who
in
produced
a
latin
translation
of
the
qorân
accompanied
by
an
elaborate
refutation
was
no
less
than
hottinger
imbued
with
the
necessity
of
shuddering
at
every
mention
of
the
false
prophet
and
prideaux
whose
de
appeared
in
the
same
year
in
amsterdam
abused
and
shuddered
with
them
and
held
up
his
biography
of
mohammed
as
a
mirror
to
unbelievers
atheists
deists
and
libertines
it
was
a
dutch
scholar
reland
the
utrecht
professor
of
theology
who
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
frankly
and
warmly
recommended
the
application
of
historical
justice
even
towards
the
mohammedan
religion
in
his
short
latin
sketch
of
islâm
he
allowed
the
mohammedan
authorities
to
speak
for
themselves
in
his
dedicatio
to
his
brother
and
in
his
extensive
preface
he
explains
his
then
new
method
is
it
to
be
supposed
he
asks
that
a
religion
as
ridiculous
as
the
islâm
described
by
christian
authors
should
have
found
millions
of
devotees
let
the
moslims
themselves
describe
their
own
religion
for
us
just
as
the
jewish
and
christian
religions
are
falsely
represented
by
the
heathen
and
protestantism
by
catholics
so
every
religion
is
misrepresented
by
its
antagonists
we
are
mortals
subject
to
error
especially
where
religious
matters
are
concerned
we
often
allow
ourselves
to
be
grossly
misled
by
passion
although
it
may
cause
readers
to
doubt
the
writer
orthodoxy
he
continues
to
maintain
that
truth
can
only
be
served
by
combating
her
opponents
in
an
honourable
way

a

to
make
our
irrational
pride
give
place

gratitude
to

for
the
undeserved
mercy
which
he
bestowed
upon
us
in

reland
has
no
illusions
that
his
scientific
justice
will
find
acceptance
in
a
wide
circle
as
he
becomes
daily
more

convinced
that
the

to

deceived

is
governed
by
prejudice

it
was
not
long
before
the
scale
was
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
and
islâm
was
made
by
some
people
the
object
of
panegyrics
as
devoid
of
scientific
foundation
as
the
former
calumnies
in
appeared
in
london
the
incomplete
posthumous
work
of
count
de
boulainvilliers
de
mahomet
in
which
amongst
other
things
he
says
of
the
arabian
prophet
that
all
that
he
has
said
concerning
the
essential
religious
dogmas
is
true
but
he
has
not
said
all
that
is
true
and
it
is
only
therein
that
his
religion
differs
from
ours
de
boulainvilliers
tells
us
with
particular
satisfaction
that
mohammed
who
respected
the
devotion
of
hermits
and
monks
proceeded
with
the
utmost
severity
against
the
official
clergy
condemning
its
members
either
to
death
or
to
the
abjuration
of
their
faith
this
de
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
an
romance
the
material
of
which
was
supplied
by
a
superficial
knowledge
of
islâm
drawn
from
secondary
sources
that
a
work
with
such
a
tendency
was
sure
to
arouse
interest
at
that
time
is
shown
by
a
letter
from
the
publisher
coderc
to
professor
gagnier
at
oxford
in
which
he
writes
he
de
boulainvilliers
mixes
up
his
history
with
many
political
reflections
which
by
their
newness
and

these
bold

very
dangerous

in

between
the

violent

of

and
prideaux
and
the
ridiculous
acclamations
of

yet
this
does
not
prevent
him
in
his

from
calling
mohammed
the
greatest
villain
of

the
most
mortal

the

love

which

bravely

still
the
prejudicial
view
remained
for
a
considerable
time
the
prevalent
one
mohammed
was
branded
as
even
in
circles
where
christian
fanaticism
was
out
of
the
question
voltaire
did
not
write
his
tragedy
ou

as
a
historical
study
he
was
aware
that
his
fiction
was
in
many
respects
at
variance
with
history
in
writing
his
work
he
was
as
he
himself
expresses
it
inspired
by
du
genre
humain
et
du
fanatisme
he
wanted
to
put
before
the
public
an
armed
tartufe
and
thought
he
might
lay
the
part
upon
mohammed
for
says
he
is
not
the
man
who
makes
war
against
his
own
country
and
dares
to
do
it
in
the
name
of
god
capable
of
any
ill
the
dislike
that
voltaire
had
conceived
for
the
qorân

a
superficial
acquaintance
with
it

probably
increased
his
unfavourable
opinion
but
the
principal
motive
of
his
choice
of
a
representative
must
have
been
that
the
general
public
still
regarded
mohammed
as
the
incarnation
of
fanaticism
and
priestcraft
almost
a
century

between

great
merit

extensive

his
final
opinion

the

idea
in

would
be
an
injustice
to

no

than
a
clever
impostor
an
ambitious

he
was
in

his
nation
from

and
to
regenerate

about
twenty
years
later
the
biography
of
mohammed
made
an
enormous
advance
through
the
works
of

and
nôldeke
on
the
ground
of
much
wider
and
at
the

deeper

much
sharper
and
more
cautious
in
his
historical
criticism

by

only
historical
value
nôldeke

still
an
indispensable
instrument
of

more
than
half
a

or
less
successful
efforts
to
make
mohammed
life
understood
by
the
nineteenth
century
intellect
have
followed
these
without
much
permanent
gain
mohammed
who
was
represented
to
the
public
in
turn
as
deceiver
as
a
genius
mislead
by
the
devil
as
epileptic
as
hysteric
and
as

obliged
later

to
submit
to
playing
on
the
one
hand
the
part
of
socialist
and
on
the
other
hand
that
of
a
defender
of
capitalism
these
points
of
view
were
principally
characteristic
of
the
temperament
of
the
scholars
who
held
them
they
did
not
really
advance
our
understanding
of
the
events
that
took
place
at
mecca
and
medina
between
and
that
prologue
to
a
perplexing
historical
drama
the
principal
source
from
which
all
biographers
started
and
to
which
they
always
returned
was
the
qorân
the
collection
of
words
of
allah
spoken
by
mohammed
in
those
years
hardly
anyone
amongst
the
faithful
and
the
unfaithful
doubts
the
generally
authentic
character
of
its
contents
except
the
parisian
professor
casanova
he
tried
to
prove
a
little
while
ago
that
mohammed
revelations
originally
contained
the
announcement
that
the
hour
the
final
catastrophe
the
last
judgment
would
come
during
his
life
when
his
death
had
therefore
falsified
this
prophecy
according
to
casanova
the
leaders
of
the
young
community
found
themselves
obliged
to
submit
the
revelations
preserved
in
writing
or
memory
to
a
thorough
revision
to
add
some
which
announced
the
mortality
even
of
the
last
prophet
and
finally
to
console
the
disappointed
faithful
with
the
hope
of
mohammed
return
before
the
end
of
the
world
this
doctrine
of
the
return
mentioned
neither
in
the
qorân
nor
in
the
eschatological
tradition
of
later
times
according
to
casanova
was
afterwards
changed
again
into
the
expectation
of
the
mahdî
the
last
of
mohammed
deputies
a
guided
of
god
who
shall
be
descended
from
mohammed
bear
his
name
resemble
him
in
appearance
and
who
shall
fill
the

it
is

with
injustice

tyranny

his
hypotheses
are
founded
upon
weil
doubts
of
the
authenticity
of
a
few
verses
of
the

which
doubts
were
sufficiently
refuted
half
a
century
ago
by
nôldeke
in
his
des
edition
etc
in
our
sceptical
times
there
is
very
little
that
is
above
criticism
and
one
day
or
other
we
may
expect
to
hear
that
mohammed
never
existed
the
arguments
for
this
can
hardly
be
weaker
than
those
of
casanova
against
the
authenticity
of
the
qorân
here
we
may
acknowledge
the
great
power
of
what
has
been
believed
in
all
times
in
all
places
by
all
the
members
of
the
community
quod
semper
quod
ubique
quod
ab
omnibus
creditum
est
for
after
the
death
of
mohammed
there
immediately
arose
a
division
which
none
of
the
leading
personalities
were
able
to
escape
and
the
opponents
spared
each
other
no
possible
kind
of
insult
scorn
or
calumny
the
enemies
of
the
first
leaders
of
the
community
could
have
wished
for
no
more
powerful
weapon
for
their
attack
than
a
accusation
of
falsifying
the
word
of
god
yet
this
accusation
was
never
brought
against
the
first
collectors
of
the
scattered
revelations
the
only
reproach
that
was
made
against
them
in
connexion
with
this
labour
being
that
verses
in
which
the
holy
family
ali
and
fatimah
were
mentioned
with
honour
and
which
therefore
would
have
served
to
support
the
claims
of
the
alids
to
the
succession
of
mohammed
were
suppressed
by
them
this
was
maintained
by
the
who
are
unsurpassed
in
islâm
as
falsifiers
of
history
and
the
passages
which
according
to
them
are
omitted
from
the
official
qorân
would
involve
precisely
on
account
of
their
reference
to
the
succession
the
mortality
of
mohammed
all
sects
and
parties
have
the
same
text
of
the
qorân
this
may
have
its
errors
and
defects
but
intentional
alterations
or
mutilations
of
real
importance
are
not
to
blame
for
this
now
this
rich
authentic
source
this
collection
of
wild
poetic
representations
of
the
day
of
judgment
of
striving
against
idolatry
of
stories
from
sacred
history
of
exhortation
to
the
practice
of
the
cardinal
virtues
of
the
old
and
new
testament
of
precepts
to
reform
the
individual
domestic
and
tribal
life
in
the
spirit
of
these
virtues
of
incantations
and
forms
of
prayer
and
a
hundred
things
besides
is
not
always
comprehensible
to
us
even
for
the
parts
which
we
do
understand
we
are
not
able
to
make
out
the
chronological
arrangement
which
is
necessary
to
gain
an
insight
into
mohammed
personality
and
work
this
is
not
only
due
to
the
form
of
the
oracles
which
purposely
differs
from
the
usual
tone
of
mortals
by
its
unctuousness
and
rhymed
prose
but
even
more
to
the
circumstance
that
all
that
the
hearers
could
know
is
assumed
to
be
known
so
the
qorân
is
full
of
references
that
are
enigmatical
to
us
we
therefore
need
additional
explanation
and
this
can
only
be
derived
from
tradition
concerning
the
circumstances
under
which
each
revelation
was
delivered
and
truly
the
sacred
tradition
of
islâm
is
not
deficient
in
data
of
this
sort
in
the
canonical
and
collections
of
tradition
concerning
what
the
prophet
has
said
done
and
omitted
to
do
in
biographical
works
an
answer
is
given
to
every
question
which
may
arise
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
of
the
qorân
and
there
are
many
in
which
these
answers
are
appended
to
the
verses
which
they
are
supposed
to
elucidate
sometimes
the
explanations
appear
to
us
even
at
first
sight
improbable
and
unacceptable
sometimes
they
contradict
each
other
a
good
many
seem
quite
reasonable
the
critical
biographers
of
mohammed
have
therefore
begun
their
work
of
sifting
by
eliminating
the
improbable
and
by
choosing
between
contradictory
data
by
means
of
critical
comparison
here
the
gradually
increasing
knowledge
of
the
spirit
of
the
different
parties
in
islâm
was
an
important
aid
as
of
course
each
group
represented
the
facts
in
the
way
which
best
served
their
own
purposes
however
cautiously
and
acutely
weil
and
his
successors
have
proceeded
the
continual
progress
of
the
analysis
of
the
legislative
as
well
as
of
the
historical
tradition
of
islam
since
has
necessitated
a
renewed
investigation
in
the
first
place
it
has
become
ever
more
evident
that
the
thousands
of
traditions
about
mohammed
which
together
with
the
qorân
form
the
foundation
upon
which
the
doctrine
and
life
of
the
community
are
based
are
for
the
most
part
the
conventional
expression
of
all
the
opinions
which
prevailed
amongst
his
followers
during
the
first
three
centuries
after
the
hijrah
the
fiction
originated
a
long
time
after
mohammed
death
during
the
turbulent
period
of
the
great
conquests
there
was
no
leisure
for
such
work
our
own
conventional
insincerities
differ
so
much
externally
at
least
from
those
of
that
date
that
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
realize
a
spiritual
atmosphere
where
pious
fraud
was
practised
on
such
a
scale
yet
this
is
literally
true
in
the
first
centuries
of
islâm
no
one
could
have
dreamt
of
any
other
way
of
gaining
acceptance
for
a
doctrine
or
a
precept
than
by
circulating
a
tradition
according
to
which
mohammed
had
preached
the
doctrine
or
dictated
it
or
had
lived
according
to
the
precept
the
whole
individual
domestic
social
and
political
life
as
it
developed
in
the
three
centuries
during
which
the
simple
arabian
religion
was
adjusted
to
the
complicated
civilization
of
the
great
nations
of
that
time
that
all
life
was
theoretically
justified
by
representing
it
as
the
application
of
minute
laws
supposed
to
have
been
elaborated
by
mohammed
by
precept
and
example
thus
tradition
gives
invaluable
material
for
the
knowledge
of
the
conflict
of
opinions
in
the
first
centuries
a
strife
the
sharpness
of
which
has
been
blunted
in
later
times
by
a
most
resourceful
harmonistic
method
but
it
is
vain
to
endeavour
to
construct
the
life
and
teaching
of
mohammed
from
such
spurious
accounts
they
can
not
even
afford
us
a
reliable
illustration
of
his
life
in
the
form
of
table
talk
as
an
english
scholar
rather
naïvely
tried
to
derive
from
them
in
a
collection
of
this
sort
supported
by
good
external
evidence
there
would
be
attributed
to
the
prophet
of
mecca
sayings
from
the
old
and
new
testament
wise
saws
from
classical
and
arabian
antiquity
prescriptions
of
roman
law
and
many
other
things
each
text
of
which
was
as
authentic
as
its
fellows
anyone
who
warned
by
goldziher
and
others
has
realized
how
matters
stand
in
this
respect
will
be
careful
not
to
take
the
legislative
tradition
as
a
direct
instrument
for
the
explanation
of
the
qorân
when
after
a
most
careful
investigation
of
thousands
of
traditions
which
all
appear
equally
old
we
have
selected
the
oldest
then
we
shall
see
that
we
have
before
us
only
witnesses
of
the
first
century
of
the
hijrah
the
connecting
threads
with
the
time
of
mohammed
must
be
supplied
for
a
great
part
by
imagination
the
historical
or
biographical
tradition
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
has
only
lately
been
submitted
to
a
keener
examination
it
was
known
for
a
long
time
that
here
too
besides
theological
and
legendary
elements
there
were
traditions
originating
from
party
motive
intended
to
give
an
appearance
of
historical
foundation
to
the
particular
interests
of
certain
persons
or
families
but
it
was
thought
that
after
some
sifting
there
yet
remained
enough
to
enable
us
to
form
a
much
clearer
sketch
of
life
than
that
of
any
other
of
the
founders
of
a
universal
religion
it
is
especially
prince
caetani
and
father
lammens
who
have
disturbed
this
illusion
according
to
them
even
the
data
which
had
been
pretty
generally
regarded
as
objective
rest
chiefly
upon
tendentious
fiction
the
generations
that
worked
at
the
biography
of
the
prophet
were
too
far
removed
from
his
time
to
have
true
data
or
notions
and
moreover
it
was
not
their
aim
to
know
the
past
as
it
was
but
to
construct
a
picture
of
it
as
it
ought
to
have
been
according
to
their
opinion
upon
the
bare
canvass
of
verses
of
the
qorân
that
need
explanation
the
traditionists
have
embroidered
with
great
boldness
scenes
suitable
to
the
desires
or
ideals
of
their
particular
group
or
to
use
a
favourite
metaphor
of
lammens
they
fill
the
empty
spaces
by
a
process
of
stereotyping
which
permits
the
critical
observer
to
recognize
the
origin
of
each
picture
in
the
sîrah
biography
the
distance
of
the
first
describers
from
their
object
is
the
same
as
in
the
hadîth
legislative
tradition
in
both
we
get
images
of
very
distant
things
perceived
by
means
of
fancy
rather
than
by
sight
and
taking
different
shapes
according
to
the
inclinations
of
each
circle
of
describers
now
it
may
be
true
that
the
latest
judges
have
here
and
there
examined
the
mohammedan
traditions
too
sceptically
and
too
suspiciously
nevertheless
it
remains
certain
that
in
the
light
of
their
research
the
method
of
examination
can
not
remain
unchanged
we
must
endeavour
to
make
our
explanations
of
the
qorân
independent
of
tradition
and
in
respect
to
portions
where
this
is
impossible
we
must
be
suspicious
of
explanations
however
apparently
plausible
during
the
last
few
years
the
accessible
sources
of
information
have
considerably
increased
the
study
of
them
has
become
much
deeper
and
more
methodical
and
the
result
is
that
we
can
tell
much
less
about
the
teaching
and
the
life
of
mohammed
than
could
our
predecessors
half
a
century
ago
this
apparent
loss
is
of
course
in
reality
nothing
but
gain
those
who
do
not
take
part
in
new
discoveries
nevertheless
wish
to
know
now
and
then
the
results
of
the
observations
made
with
constantly
improved
instruments
let
me
endeavour
very
briefly
to
satisfy
this
curiosity
that
the
report
of
the
bookkeeping
might
make
a
somewhat
different
impression
if
another
accountant
had
examined
it
goes
without
saying
and
sometimes
i
shall
draw
particular
attention
to
my
personal
responsibility
in
this
respect
of
mohammed
life
before
his
appearance
as
the
messenger
of
god
we
know
extremely
little
compared
to
the
legendary
biography
as
treasured
by
the
faithful
practically
nothing
not
to
mention
his
as
a
light
which
was
with
god
and
for
the
sake
of
which
god
created
the
world
the
light
which
as
the
principle
of
revelation
lived
in
all
prophets
from
adam
onwards
and
the
final
revelation
of
which
in
mohammed
was
prophesied
in
the
scriptures
of
the
jews
and
the
christians
not
to
mention
the
wonderful
and
mysterious
signs
which
announced
the
birth
of
the
seal
of
the
prophets
and
many
other
features
which
the
later
sîrahs
biographies
and
maulids
pious
histories
of
his
birth
most
in
rhymed
prose
or
in
poetic
metre
produce
in
imitation
of
the
gospels
even
the
elaborate
discourses
of
the
older
biographies
on
occurrences
which
in
themselves
might
quite
well
come
within
the
limits
of
possibility
do
not
belong
to
history
fiction
plays
such
a
great
part
in
these
stories
that
we
are
never
sure
of
being
on
historical
ground
unless
the
qorân
gives
us
a
firm
footing
the
question
whether
the
family
to
which
mohammed
belonged
was
regarded
as
noble
amongst
the
qoraishites
the
ruling
tribe
in
mecca
is
answered
in
the
affirmative
by
many
but
by
others
this
answer
is
questioned
not
without
good
grounds
the
matter
is
not
of
prime
importance
as
there
is
no
doubt
that
mohammed
grew
up
as
a
poor
orphan
and
belonged
to
the
needy
and
the
neglected
even
a
long
time
after
his
first
appearance
the
unbelievers
reproached
him
according
to
the
qorân
with
his
insignificant
worldly
position
which
fitted
ill
with
a
heavenly
message
the
same
scornful
reproach
according
to
the
qorân
was
hurled
at
mohammed
predecessors
by
sceptics
of
earlier
generations
and
it
is
well
known
that
the
stories
of
older
times
in
the
qorân
are
principally
reflections
of
what
mohammed
himself
experienced
the
legends
of
mohammed
relations
to
various
members
of
his
family
are
too
closely
connected
with
the
pretensions
of
their
descendants
to
have
any
value
for
biographic
purposes
he
married
late
an
elderly
woman
who
it
is
said
was
able
to
lighten
his
material
cares
she
gave
him
the
only
daughter
by
whom
he
had
descendants
descendants
who
from
the
arabian
point
of
view
do
not
count
as
such
as
according
to
their
genealogical
theories
the
line
of
descent
can
not
pass
through
a
woman
they
have
made
an
exception
for
the
prophet
as
male
offspring
the
only
blessing
of
marriage
appreciated
by
arabs
was
withheld
from
him
in
the
materialistic
commercial
town
of
mecca
where
lust
of
gain
and
usury
reigned
supreme
where
women
wine
and
gambling
filled
up
the
leisure
time
where
might
was
right
and
widows
orphans
and
the
feeble
were
treated
as
superfluous
ballast
an
unfortunate
being
like
mohammed
if
his
constitution
were
sensitive
must
have
experienced
most
painful
emotions
in
the
intellectual
advantages
that
the
place
offered
he
could
find
no
solace
the
highly
developed
arabian
art
of
words
poetry
with
its
fictitious
amourettes
its
polished
descriptions
of
portions
of
arabian
nature
its
venal
vain
praise
and
satire
might
serve
as
dessert
to
a
dish
they
were
unable
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
material
prosperity
mohammed
felt
his
misery
as
a
pain
too
great
to
be
endured
in
some
way
or
other
he
must
be
delivered
from
it
he
desired
to
be
more
than
the
greatest
in
his
surroundings
and
he
knew
that
in
that
which
they
counted
for
happiness
he
could
never
even
equal
them
rather
than
envy
them
regretfully
he
preferred
to
despise
their
values
of
life
but
on
that
very
account
he
had
to
oppose
these
values
with
better
ones
it
was
not
unknown
in
mecca
that
elsewhere
communities
existed
acquainted
with
such
high
ideals
of
life
spiritual
goods
accessible
to
the
poor
even
to
them
in
particular
apart
from
commerce
which
brought
the
inhabitants
of
mecca
into
contact
with
abyssinians
syrians
and
others
there
were
far
to
the
south
and
less
far
to
the
north
and
of
mecca
arabian
tribes
who
had
embraced
the
jewish
or
the
christian
religion
perhaps
this
circumstance
had
helped
to
make
the
inhabitants
of
mecca
familiar
with
the
idea
of
a
creator
allah
but
this
had
little
significance
in
their
lives
as
in
the
maker
of
the
universe
they
did
not
see
their
lawgiver
and
judge
but
held
themselves
dependent
for
their
good
and
evil
fortune
upon
all
manner
of
beings
which
they
rendered
favourable
or
harmless
by
animistic
practices
thoroughly
conservative
they
did
not
take
great
interest
in
the
conceptions
of
the
people
of
the
scripture
as
they
called
the
jews
christians
and
perhaps
some
other
sects
arisen
from
these
communities
but
mohammed
deeply
felt
misery
awakened
his
interest
in
them
whether
this
had
been
the
case
with
a
few
others
before
him
in
the
milieu
of
mecca
we
need
not
consider
as
it
does
not
help
to
explain
his
actions
if
wide
circles
had
been
anxious
to
know
more
about
the
contents
of
the
scripture
mohammed
would
not
have
felt
in
the
dark
in
the
way
that
he
did
we
shall
probably
never
know
by
intercourse
with
whom
it
really
was
that
mohammed
at
last
gained
some
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
sacred
books
of
judaism
and
christianity
probably
through
various
people
and
over
a
considerable
length
of
time
it
was
not
lettered
men
who
satisfied
his
awakened
curiosity
otherwise
the
quite
confused
ideas
especially
in
the
beginning
of
the
revelation
concerning
the
mutual
relations
between
jews
and
christians
could
not
be
explained
confusions
between
miryam
the
sister
of
moses
and
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
between
saul
and
gideon
mistakes
about
the
relationship
of
abraham
to
isaac
ishmael
and
jacob
might
be
put
down
to
misconceptions
of
mohammed
himself
who
could
not
all
at
once
master
the
strange
material
but
his
representation
of
judaism
and
christianity
and
a
number
of
other
forms
of
revelation
as
almost
identical
in
their
contents
differing
only
in
the
place
where
the
time
wherein
and
the
messenger
of
god
by
whom
they
came
to
man
this
idea
which
runs
like
a
crimson
thread
through
all
the
revelations
of
the
first
twelve
years
of
mohammed
prophecy
could
not
have
existed
if
he
had
had
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
jewish
or
christian
men
of
letters
moreover
the
many
features
and
stories
which
the
qorân
contains
concerning
the
past
of
mankind
indicate
a
vulgar
origin
and
especially
as
regards
the
christian
legends
communications
from
people
who
lived
outside
the
communion
of
the
great
christian
churches
this
is
sufficiently
proved
by
the
docetical
representation
of
the
death
of
jesus
and
the
many
stories
about
his
life
taken
from
apocryphal
sources
or
from
popular
oral
legends
mohammed
unlearned
imagination
worked
all
such
material
together
into
a
religious
history
of
mankind
in
which
adam
descendants
had
become
divided
into
innumerable
groups
of
peoples
differing
in
speech
and
place
of
abode
whose
aim
in
life
at
one
period
or
another
came
to
resemble
wonderfully
that
of
the
inhabitants
of
and
in
the
seventh
century
hereby
they
strayed
from
the
true
path
in
strife
with
the
commands
given
by
allah
the
whole
of
history
therefore
was
for
him
a
long
series
of
repetitions
of
the
antithesis
between
the
foolishness
of
men
as
this
was
now
embodied
in
the
social
state
of
mecca
and
the
wisdom
of
god
as
known
to
the
people
of
the
scripture
to
bring
the
erring
ones
back
to
the
true
path
it
was
allah
plan
to
send
them
messengers
from
out
of
their
midst
who
delivered
his
ritual
and
his
moral
directions
to
them
in
his
own
words
who
demanded
the
acknowledgment
of
allah
omnipotence
and
if
they
refused
to
follow
the
true
guidance
threatened
them
with
allah
temporary
or
even
more
with
his
eternal
punishment
the
antithesis
is
always
the
same
from
adam
to
jesus
and
the
enumeration
of
the
scenes
is
therefore
rather
monotonous
the
only
variety
is
in
the
detail
borrowed
from
biblical
and
apocryphal
legends
in
all
the
thousands
of
years
the
messengers
of
allah
play
the
same
part
as
mohammed
finally
saw
himself
called
upon
to
play
towards
his
people
mohammed
account
of
the
past
contains
more
elements
of
jewish
than
of
christian
origin
and
he
ignores
the
principal
dogmas
of
the
christian
church
in
spite
of
his
supernatural
birth
jesus
is
only
a
prophet
like
moses
and
others
and
although
his
miracles
surpass
those
of
other
messengers
mohammed
at
a
later
period
of
his
life
is
inclined
to
place
abraham
above
jesus
in
certain
respects
yet
the
influence
of
christianity
upon
mohammed
vocation
was
very
great
without
the
christian
idea
of
the
final
scene
of
human
history
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
the
last
judgment
mohammed
mission
would
have
no
meaning
it
is
true
monotheism
in
the
jewish
sense
and
after
the
contrast
had
become
clear
to
mohammed
accompanied
by
an
express
rejection
of
the
son
of
god
and
of
the
trinity
has
become
one
of
the
principal
dogmas
of
islâm
but
in
mohammed
first
preaching
the
announcement
of
the
day
of
judgment
is
much
more
prominent
than
the
unity
of
god
and
it
was
against
his
revelations
concerning
doomsday
that
his
opponents
directed
their
satire
during
the
first
twelve
years
it
was
not
love
of
their
gods
but
anger
at
the
wretch
who
was
never
tired
of
telling
them
in
the
name
of
allah
that
all
their
life
was
idle
and
despicable
that
in
the
other
world
they
would
be
the
outcasts
which
opened
the
floodgates
of
irony
and
scorn
against
mohammed
and
it
was
mohammed
anxiety
for
his
own
lot
and
that
of
those
who
were
dear
to
him
in
that
future
life
that
forced
him
to
seek
a
solution
of
the
question
who
shall
bring
my
people
out
of
the
darkness
of
antithesis
into
the
light
of
obedience
to
allah
we
should
be
inclined
to
imagine
a
simpler
answer
to
the
question
than
that
which
mohammed
found
he
might
have
become
a
missionary
of
judaism
or
of
christianity
to
the
meccans
however
natural
such
a
conclusion
may
appear
to
us
from
the
premises
with
which
we
are
acquainted
it
did
not
occur
to
mohammed
he
began
the
qorân
tells
us
expressly
by
regarding
the
arabs
or
at
all
events
arabs
as
heretofore
destitute
of
divine
message
to
whom
we
have
sent
no
warner
before
you
moses
and
jesus
not
to
mention
any
others
had
not
been
sent
for
the
arabs
and
as
allah
would
not
leave
any
section
of
mankind
without
a
revelation
their
prophet
must
still
be
to
come
apparently
mohammed
regarded
the
jewish
and
christian
tribes
in
arabia
as
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
an
ethnical
group
was
at
the
same
time
a
religious
unity
he
did
not
imagine
that
it
could
be
in
allah
plan
that
the
arabs
were
to
conform
to
a
revelation
given
in
a
foreign
language
no
god
must
speak
to
them
in
arabic
through
whose
mouth
footnote
etc
footnote
etc
a
long
and
severe
crisis
preceded
mohammed
call
he
was
convinced
that
if
he
were
the
man
mighty
signs
from
heaven
must
be
revealed
to
him
for
his
conception
of
revelation
was
mechanical
allah
himself
or
at
least
angels
must
speak
to
him
the
time
of
waiting
the
process
of
objectifying
the
subjective
lived
through
by
the
help
of
an
overstrained
imagination
all
this
laid
great
demands
upon
the
psychical
and
physical
constitution
of
mohammed
at
length
he
saw
and
heard
that
which
he
thought
he
ought
to
hear
and
see
in
feverish
dreams
he
found
the
form
for
the
revelation
and
he
did
not
in
the
least
realize
that
the
contents
of
his
inspiration
from
heaven
were
nothing
but
the
result
of
what
he
had
himself
absorbed
he
realized
it
so
little
that
the
identity
of
what
was
revealed
to
him
with
what
he
held
to
be
the
contents
of
the
scriptures
of
jews
and
christians
was
a
miracle
to
him
the
only
miracle
upon
which
he
relied
for
the
support
of
his
mission
in
the
course
of
the
years
of
mohammed
work
as
messenger
the
state
or
inspiration
or
whatever
we
may
call
the
peculiar
spiritual
condition
in
which
his
revelation
was
born
gradually
gave
place
to
quiet
reflection
especially
after
the
hijrah
when
the
prophet
had
to
provide
the
state
established
by
him
at
medina
with
inspired
regulations
the
words
of
god
became
in
almost
every
respect
different
from
what
they
had
been
at
first
only
the
form
was
retained
in
connection
with
this
evolution
some
of
our
biographers
of
mohammed
even
where
they
do
not
deny
the
obvious
honesty
of
his
first
visions
represent
him
in
the
second
half
of
his
work
as
a
sort
of
actor
who
played
with
that
which
had
been
most
sacred
to
him
this
accusation
is
in
my
opinion
unjust
mohammed
who
twelve
years
long
in
spite
of
derision
and
contempt
continued
to
inveigh
in
the
name
of
allah
against
the
frivolous
conservatism
of
the
heathens
in
mecca
to
preach
allah
omnipotence
to
them
to
hold
up
to
them
allah
commands
and
his
promises
and
threats
regarding
the
future
life
without
asking
any
reward
for
such
exhausting
work
is
really
not
another
man
than
the
acknowledged
messenger
of
allah
in
medina
who
saw
his
power
gradually
increase
who
was
taught
by
experience
the
value
and
the
use
of
the
material
means
of
extending
it
and
who
finally
by
the
force
of
arms
compelled
all
arabs
to
obedience
to
allah
and
his
messenger
in
our
own
society
real
enthusiasm
in
the
propagation
of
an
idea
generally
considered
as
absurd
if
crowned
by
success
may
in
the
course
of
time
end
in
cold
prosaic
calculation
without
a
trace
of
hypocrisy
nowhere
in
the
life
of
mohammed
can
a
point
of
turning
be
shown
there
is
a
gradual
changing
of
aims
and
a
readjustment
of
the
means
of
attaining
them
from
the
first
the
outcast
felt
himself
superior
to
the
people
who
looked
down
upon
him
and
with
all
his
power
he
sought
for
a
position
from
which
he
could
force
them
to
acknowledge
his
superiority
this
he
found
in
the
next
and
better
world
of
which
the
jews
and
christians
knew
after
a
crisis
which
some
consider
as
psychopathologic
he
knew
himself
to
be
sent
by
allah
to
call
the
materialistic
community
which
he
hated
and
despised
to
the
alternative
either
in
following
him
to
find
eternal
blessedness
or
in
denying
him
to
be
doomed
to
eternal
fire
powerless
against
the
scepticism
of
his
hearers
after
twelve
years
of
preaching
followed
only
by
a
few
dozen
most
of
them
outcasts
like
himself
he
hoped
now
and
then
that
allah
would
strike
the
recalcitrant
multitude
with
an
earthly
doom
as
he
knew
from
revelations
had
happened
before
this
hope
was
also
unfulfilled
as
other
messengers
of
god
had
done
in
similar
circumstances
he
sought
for
a
more
fruitful
field
than
that
of
his
birthplace
he
set
out
on
the
hijrah
emigration
to
medina
here
circumstances
were
more
favourable
to
him
in
a
short
time
he
became
the
head
of
a
considerable
community
allah
who
had
given
him
power
soon
allowed
him
to
use
it
for
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
the
faithful
against
the
unbelievers
once
become
militant
mohammed
turned
from
the
purely
defensive
to
the
aggressive
attitude
with
such
success
that
a
great
part
of
the
arab
tribes
were
compelled
to
accept
islâm
obedience
to
allah
and
his
messenger
the
rule
formerly
insisted
upon
no
compulsion
in
religion
was
sacrificed
since
experience
taught
him
that
the
truth
was
more
easily
forced
upon
men
by
violence
than
by
threats
which
would
be
fulfilled
only
after
the
resurrection
naturally
the
religious
value
of
the
conversions
sank
in
proportion
as
their
number
increased
the
prophet
of
world
renouncement
in
mecca
wished
to
win
souls
for
his
faith
the
in
medina
needed
subjects
and
fighters
for
his
army
yet
he
was
still
the
same
mohammed
parallel
with
his
altered
position
towards
the
heathen
arabs
went
a
readjustment
of
his
point
of
view
towards
the
followers
of
scripture
mohammed
never
pretended
to
preach
a
new
religion
he
demanded
in
the
name
of
allah
the
same
islâm
submission
that
moses
jesus
and
former
prophets
had
demanded
of
their
nations
in
his
earlier
revelations
he
always
points
out
the
identity
of
his
qorâns
with
the
contents
of
the
sacred
books
of
jews
and
christians
in
the
sure
conviction
that
these
will
confirm
his
assertion
if
asked
in
medina
he
was
disillusioned
by
finding
neither
jews
nor
christians
prepared
to
acknowledge
an
arabian
prophet
not
even
for
the
arabs
only
so
he
was
led
to
distinguish
between
the
contents
of
the
bible
and
that
which
had
been
made
of
it
by
the
falsification
of
later
jews
and
christians
he
preferred
now
to
connect
his
own
revelations
more
immediately
with
those
of
abraham
no
books
of
whom
could
be
cited
against
him
and
who
was
acknowledged
by
jews
and
christians
without
being
himself
either
a
jew
or
a
christian
this
turn
this
particular
connection
of
islâm
with
abraham
made
it
possible
for
him
by
means
of
an
adaptation
of
the
biblical
legends
concerning
abraham
hagar
and
ishmael
to
include
in
his
religion
a
set
of
religious
customs
of
the
meccans
especially
the
hajj
thus
islâm
became
more
arabian
and
at
the
same
time
more
independent
of
the
other
revealed
religions
whose
degeneracy
was
demonstrated
by
their
refusal
to
acknowledge
mohammed
footnote
a
complete
explanation
of
the
gradual
development
of
the
abraham
legend
in
the
qorân
can
be
found
in
my
book
mekkaansche
the
feast
of
mecca
leiden
all
this
is
to
be
explained
without
the
supposition
of
conscious
trickery
or
dishonesty
on
the
part
of
mohammed
there
was
no
other
way
for
the
unlettered
prophet
whose
belief
in
his
mission
was
unshaken
to
overcome
the
difficulties
entailed
by
his
closer
acquaintance
with
the
tenets
of
other
religions
how
then
are
we
to
explain
the
of
it
all
mohammed
sense
of
vocation
was
it
a
disease
of
the
spirit
a
kind
of
madness
at
all
events
the
data
are
insufficient
upon
which
to
form
a
serious
diagnosis
some
have
called
it
epilepsy
sprenger
with
an
exaggerated
display
of
certainty
based
upon
his
former
medical
studies
gave
mohammed
disorder
the
name
of
hysteria
others
try
to
find
a
connection
between
extraordinary
interest
in
the
fair
sex
and
his
prophetic
consciousness
but
after
all
is
it
explaining
the
spiritual
life
of
a
man
who
was
certainly
unique
if
we
put
a
label
upon
him
and
thus
class
him
with
others
who
at
the
most
shared
with
him
certain
abnormalities
a
normal
man
mohammed
certainly
was
not
but
as
soon
as
we
try
to
give
a
positive
name
to
this
negative
quality
then
we
do
the
same
as
the
heathens
of
mecca
who
were
violently
awakened
by
his
thundering
prophecies
he
is
nothing
but
one
possessed
a
poet
a
soothsayer
a
sorcerer
they
said
whether
we
say
with
the
old
european
biographers
impostor
or
with
the
modern
ones
put
epileptic
or
hysteric
in
its
place
makes
little
difference
the
meccans
ended
by
submitting
to
him
and
conquering
a
world
under
the
banner
of
his
faith
we
with
the
diffidence
which
true
science
implies
feel
obliged
merely
to
call
him
mohammed
and
to
seek
in
the
qorân
and
with
great
cautiousness
in
the
tradition
a
few
principal
points
of
his
life
and
work
in
order
to
see
how
in
his
mind
the
intense
feeling
of
discontent
during
the
misery
of
his
youth
together
with
a
great
a
feeling
of
spiritual
superiority
to
his
surroundings
developed
into
a
call
the
form
of
which
was
largely
decided
by
jewish
and
christian
influence
while
being
struck
by
various
weaknesses
which
disfigured
this
great
personality
and
which
he
himself
freely
confessed
we
must
admire
the
perseverance
with
which
he
retained
his
faith
in
his
divine
mission
not
discouraged
by
twelve
years
of
humiliation
nor
by
the
repudiation
of
the
people
of
scripture
upon
whom
he
had
relied
as
his
principal
witnesses
nor
yet
by
numbers
of
temporary
rebuffs
during
his
struggle
for
the
dominion
of
allah
and
his
messenger
which
he
carried
on
through
the
whole
of
arabia
was
mohammed
conscious
of
the
universality
of
his
mission
in
the
beginning
he
certainly
conceived
his
work
as
merely
the
arabian
part
of
a
universal
task
which
for
other
parts
of
the
world
was
laid
upon
other
messengers
in
the
medina
period
he
ever
more
decidedly
chose
the
direction
of
forcing
to
comply
he
was
content
only
when
the
heathens
perceived
that
further
resistance
to
allah
hosts
was
useless
their
understanding
of
his
clear
arabic
qorân
was
no
longer
the
principal
object
of
his
striving
an
islâm
could
equally
well
be
forced
upon
heathens
and
as
regards
the
people
of
scripture
since
mohammed
endeavour
to
be
recognized
by
them
had
failed
he
had
taken
up
his
position
opposed
to
them
even
above
them
with
the
rise
of
his
power
he
became
hard
and
cruel
to
the
jews
in
and
from
jews
and
christians
alike
in
arabia
he
demanded
submission
to
his
authority
since
it
had
proved
impossible
to
make
them
recognize
his
divine
mission
this
demand
could
quite
logically
be
extended
to
all
christians
in
the
first
place
to
those
of
the
byzantine
empire
but
did
mohammed
himself
come
to
these
conclusions
in
the
last
part
of
his
life
are
the
words
in
which
allah
spoke
to
him
we
have
sent
thee
to
men
in
general
and
a
few
expressions
of
the
same
sort
to
be
taken
in
that
sense
or
does
humanity
here
as
in
many
other
places
in
the
qorân
mean
those
with
whom
mohammed
had
especially
to
do
nôldeke
is
strongly
of
opinion
that
the
principal
lines
of
the
program
of
conquest
carried
out
after
mohammed
death
had
been
drawn
by
the
prophet
himself
lammens
and
others
deny
with
equal
vigour
that
mohammed
ever
looked
upon
the
whole
world
as
the
field
of
his
mission
this
shows
that
the
solution
is
not
evident
footnote
the
translation
of
this
verse
has
always
been
a
subject
of
great
difference
of
opinion
at
the
time
of
its
revelation
as
fixed
by
mohammedan
as
well
as
by
western
authorities
the
universal
conception
of
mohammed
mission
was
quite
out
of
question
footnote
professor
arnold
in
the
edition
london
of
his
valuable
work
preaching
of
especially
pp
warmly
endeavours
to
prove
that
mohammed
from
the
beginning
considered
his
mission
as
universal
he
weakens
his
argument
more
than
is
necessary
by
placing
the
tradition
upon
an
almost
equal
footing
with
the
qorân
as
a
source
and
by
ignoring
the
historical
development
which
is
obvious
in
the
qorân
itself
in
this
way
he
does
not
perceive
the
great
importance
of
the
history
of
the
abraham
legend
in
mohammed
conception

verses

out

nation

on
the
day

day
of
resurrection
when
we
will
raise
up

would
seem
to
refer
to
the
theme
so
constantly
repeated
in
the
qorân
that
each
nation
will
be
confronted
on
the
day
of
judgment
with
the
prophet
sent
to
it
when
the
qorân
is
called
an
admonition
to
the
world
and
mission
a
mercy
to
the
world
then
we
must
remember
that
is
one
of
the
most
misused
rhymewords
in
the
qorân
and
we
should
not
therefore
translate
it
emphatically
as
all
created
beings
unless
the
universality
of
mohammed
mission
is
firmly
established
by
other
proofs
and
this
is
far
from
being
the
case
in
our
valuation
of
mohammed
sayings
we
can
not
lay
too
much
stress
upon
his
incapability
of
looking
far
ahead
the
final
aims
which
mohammed
set
himself
were
considered
by
sane
persons
as
unattainable
his
firm
belief
in
the
realization
of
the
vague
picture
of
the
future
which
he
had
conceived
nay
which
allah
held
before
him
drove
him
to
the
uttermost
exertion
of
his
mental
power
in
order
to
surmount
the
innumerable
unexpected
obstacles
which
he
encountered
hence
the
variability
of
the
practical
directions
contained
in
the
qorân
they
are
constantly
altered
according
to
circumstances
allah
words
during
the
last
part
of
mohammed
life
this
day
have
i
perfected
your
religion
for
you
and
have
i
filled
up
the
measure
of
my
favours
towards
you
and

you
as
your
religion

in
no
way
the
meaning
of
the
exclamation
it
is
finished
of
the

they
are
only
a
cry
of
jubilation
over
the
degradation
of
the
heathen
arabs
by
the
triumph
of
allah
weapons
at
mohammed
death
everything
was
still
unstable
and
the
vital
questions
for
islâm
were
subjects
of
contention
between
the
leaders
even
before
the
prophet
had
been
buried
the
expedient
of
new
revelations
completing
altering
or
abrogating
former
ones
had
played
an
important
part
in
the
legislative
work
of
mohammed
now
he
had
never
considered
that
by
his
death
the
spring
would
be
stopped
although
completion
was
wanted
in
every
respect
for
without
doubt
mohammed
felt
his
weakness
in
systematizing
and
his
absence
of
clearness
of
vision
into
the
future
and
therefore
he
postponed
the
promulgation
of
divine
decrees
as
long
as
possible
and
he
solved
only
such
questions
of
law
as
frequently
recurred
when
further
hesitation
would
have
been
dangerous
to
his
authority
and
to
the
peace
of
the
community
at
mohammed
death
all
arabs
were
not
yet
subdued
to
his
authority
the
expeditions
which
he
had
undertaken
or
arranged
beyond
the
northern
boundaries
of
arabia
were
directed
against
arabs
although
they
were
likely
to
rouse
conflict
with
the
byzantine
and
persian
empires
it
would
have
been
contrary
to
mohammed
usual
methods
if
this
had
led
him
to
form
a
general
definition
of
his
attitude
towards
the
world
outside
arabia
as
little
as
mohammed
when
he
invoked
the
meccans
in
wild
poetic
inspirations
to
array
themselves
behind
him
to
seek
the
blessedness
of
future
life
had
dreamt
of
the
possibility
that
twenty
years
later
the
whole
of
arabia
would
acknowledge
his
authority
in
this
world
as
little
nay
much
less
could
he
at
the
close
of
his
life
have
had
the
faintest
premonition
of
the
fabulous
development
which
his
state
would
reach
half
a
century
later
the
subjugation
of
the
mighty
persia
and
of
some
of
the
richest
provinces
of
the
byzantine
empire
only
to
mention
these
was
never
a
part
of
his
program
although
legend
has
it
that
he
sent
out
written
challenges
to
the
six
princes
of
the
world
best
known
to
him
yet
we
may
say
that
mohammed
successors
in
the
guidance
of
his
community
by
continuing
their
expansion
towards
the
north
after
the
suppression
of
the
apostasy
that
followed
his
death
remained
in
mohammed
line
of
action
there
is
even
more
evident
continuity
in
the
development
of
the
empire
of
the
omayyads
out
of
the
state
of
mohammed
than
in
the
series
of
events
by
which
we
see
the
dreaded
of
medina
grew
out
of
the
possessed
one
of
mecca
but
if
mohammed
had
been
able
to
foresee
how
the
unity
of
arabia
which
he
nearly
accomplished
was
to
bring
into
being
a
formidable
international
empire
we
should
expect
some
indubitable
traces
of
this
in
the
qorân
not
a
few
verses
of
dubious
interpretation
but
some
certain
sign
that
the
revelation
which
had
repeatedly
and
with
the
greatest
emphasis
called
itself
a
plain
arabic
qorân
intended
for
those
to
whom
no
warner
had
yet
been
sent
should
in
future
be
valid
for
the
the
barbarians
as
well
as
for
the
arabs
even
if
we
ascribe
to
mohammed
something
of
the
universal
program
which
the
later
tradition
makes
him
to
have
drawn
up
he
certainly
could
not
foresee
the
success
of
it
for
this
in
the
first
place
the
economic
and
political
factors
to
which
some
scholars
of
our
day
would
attribute
the
entire
explanation
of
the
islâm
movement
must
be
taken
into
consideration
mohammed
did
to
some
extent
prepare
the
universality
of
his
religion
and
make
it
possible
but
that
islâm
which
came
into
the
world
as
the
arabian
form
of
the
one
true
religion
has
actually
become
a
universal
religion
is
due
to
circumstances
which
had
little
to
do
with
its
origin
this
extension
of
the
domain
to
be
subdued
to
its
spiritual
rule
entailed
upon
islâm
about
three
centuries
of
development
and
accommodation
of
a
different
sort
to
be
sure
but
not
less
drastic
in
character
than
that
of
the
christian
church
footnote
sir
william
muir

not

he

other
the
seed

creed

indeed
been
sown

that
it

caused
most
nations
to
become
totally
estranged
from
him
and
his
service
now
and
then
when
he
considered
that
the
time
was
come
he
caused
a
prophet
to
arise
from
among
a
nation
to
be
his
messenger
to
summon
people
to
conversion
and
to
tell
them
what
blessedness
awaited
them
as
a
reward
of
obedience
what
punishments
would
be
inflicted
if
they
did
not
believe
his
message
sometimes
the
disobedient
had
been
struck
by
earthly
judgment
the
flood
the
drowning
of
the
egyptians
etc
and
the
faithful
had
been
rescued
in
a
miraculous
way
and
led
to
victory
but
such
things
merely
served
as
indications
of
allah
greatness
one
day
the
whole
world
will
be
overthrown
and
destroyed
then
the
dead
will
be
awakened
and
led
before
allah
tribunal
the
faithful
will
have
abodes
appointed
them
in
shady
gardens
with
richly
laden
with
luxurious
couches
upon
which
they
may
lie
and
enjoy
the
delicious
food
served
by
the
ministrants
of
paradise
they
may
also
freely
indulge
in
sparkling
wine
that
does
not
intoxicate
and
in
intercourse
with
women
whose
youth
and
virginity
do
not
fade
the
unbelievers
end
their
lives
in
or
rather
there
is
no
end
for
the
punishment
as
well
as
the
reward
are
everlasting
allah
gives
to
each
one
his
due
the
actions
of
his
creatures
are
all
accurately
written
down
and
when
judgment
comes
the
book
is
opened
moreover
every
creature
carries
the
list
of
his
own
deeds
and
misdeeds
the
debit
and
credit
sides
are
carefully
weighed
against
each
other
in
the
divine
scales
and
many
witnesses
are
heard
before
judgment
is
pronounced
allah
however
is
clement
and
merciful
he
gladly
forgives
those
sinners
who
have
believed
in
him
who
have
sincerely
accepted
islâm
that
is
to
say
who
have
acknowledged
his
absolute
authority
and
have
believed
the
message
of
the
prophet
sent
to
them
these
prophets
have
the
privilege
of
acting
as
mediators
on
behalf
of
their
followers
not
in
the
sense
of
redeemers
but
as
advocates
who
receive
gracious
hearing
naturally
islâm
submission
to
the
lord
of
the
universe
ought
to
express
itself
in
deeds
allah
desires
the
homage
of
formal
worship
which
must
be
performed
several
times
a
day
by
every
individual
and
on
special
occasions
by
the
assembled
faithful
led
by
one
of
them
this
service
alât
acquired
its
strictly
binding
rules
only
after
mohammed
time
but
already
in
his
lifetime
it
consisted
chiefly
of
the
same
elements
as
now
the
recital
of
sacred
texts
especially
taken
from
the
revelation
certain
postures
of
the
body
standing
inclination
kneeling
prostration
with
the
face
towards
mecca
this
last
particular
and
the
language
of
the
revelation
are
the
arabian
elements
of
the
service
which
is
for
the
rest
an
imitation
of
jewish
and
christian
rituals
so
far
as
mohammed
knew
them
there
was
no
sacrament
consequently
no
priest
to
administer
it
islâm
has
always
been
the
lay
religion
teaching
and
exhortation
are
the
only
spiritual
help
that
the
pious
mohammedan
wants
and
this
simple
care
of
souls
is
exercised
without
any
ordination
or
consecration
fasting
for
a
month
if
possible
and
longer
if
desired
was
also
an
integral
part
of
religious
life
and
by
showing
disregard
of
earthly
joys
a
proof
of
faith
in
allah
promises
for
the
world
to
come
almsgiving
recommended
above
all
other
virtues
was
not
only
to
be
practised
in
obedience
to
allah
law
and
in
faith
in
retribution
but
it
was
to
testify
contempt
of
all
earthly
possessions
which
might
impede
the
striving
after
eternal
happiness
later
mohammed
was
compelled
by
the
need
of
a
public
fund
and
the
waning
zeal
of
the
faithful
as
their
numbers
increased
to
regulate
the
practice
of
this
virtue
and
to
exact
certain
minima
as
taxes
when
mohammed
taking
his
stand
as
opposed
to
judaism
and
christianity
had
accentuated
the
arabian
character
of
his
religion
the
meccan
rites
of
pagan
origin
were
incorporated
into
islâm
but
only
after
the
purification
required
by
monotheism
from
that
time
forward
the
yearly
celebration
of
the
hajj
was
among
the
ritual
duties
of
the
moslim
community
in
the
first
years
of
the
strife
yet
another
duty
was
most
emphatically
impressed
on
the
faithful
readiness
to
sacrifice
life
and
possessions
for
the
defence
of
islâm
understood
since
the
conquest
of
mecca
in
as
the
extension
by
force
of
arms
of
the
authority
of
the
moslim
state
first
over
the
whole
of
arabia
and
soon
after
death
over
the
whole
world
so
far
as
allah
granted
his
hosts
the
victory
for
the
rest
the
legislative
revelations
regulated
only
such
points
as
had
become
subjects
of
argument
or
contest
in
mohammed
lifetime
or
such
as
were
particularly
suggested
by
that
antithesis
of
paganism
and
revelation
which
had
determined
mohammed
prophetical
career
gambling
and
wine
were
forbidden
the
latter
after
some
hesitation
between
the
inculcation
of
temperance
and
that
of
abstinence
usury
taken
in
the
sense
of
requiring
any
interest
at
all
upon
loans
was
also
forbidden
all
tribal
feuds
with
their
consequences
had
henceforward
to
be
considered
as
and
retaliation
provided
that
the
offended
party
would
not
agree
to
accept
compensation
was
put
under
the
control
of
the
head
of
the
community
polygamy
and
intercourse
of
master
and
female
slave
were
restricted
the
obligations
arising
from
or
ownership
were
regulated
these
points
suffice
to
remind
us
of
the
nature
of
the
qorânic
regulations
reference
to
certain
subjects
in
this
revealed
law
while
others
were
ignored
did
not
depend
on
their
respective
importance
to
the
life
of
the
community
but
rather
on
what
happened
to
have
been
suggested
by
the
events
in
mohammed
lifetime
for
mohammed
knew
too
well
how
little
qualified
he
was
for
legislative
work
to
undertake
it
unless
absolutely
necessary
this
rough
sketch
of
what
islâm
meant
when
it
set
out
to
conquer
the
world
is
not
very
likely
to
create
the
impression
that
its
incredibly
rapid
extension
was
due
to
its
superiority
over
the
forms
of
civilization
which
it
supplanted
lammens
assertion
that
islâm
was
the
jewish
religion
simplified
according
to
arabic
wants
and
amplified
by
some
christian
and
arabic
traditions
contains
a
great
deal
of
truth
if
only
we
recognize
the
central
importance
for
mohammed
vocation
and
preaching
of
the
christian
doctrine
of
resurrection
and
judgment
this
explains
the
large
number
of
weak
points
that
the
book
of
mohammed
revelations
written
down
by
his
first
followers
offered
to
jewish
and
christian
polemics
it
was
easy
for
the
theologians
of
those
religions
to
point
out
numberless
mistakes
in
the
work
of
the
illiterate
arabian
prophet
especially
where
he
maintained
that
he
was
repeating
and
confirming
the
contents
of
their
bible
the
qorânic
revelations
about
allah
intercourse
with
men
taken
from
apocryphal
sources
from
profane
legends
like
that
of
alexander
the
great
sometimes
even
created
by
mohammed
own
fancy
such
as
the
story
of
the
prophet
sâlih
said
to
have
lived
in
the
north
of
arabia
and
that
of
the
prophet
hûd
supposed
to
have
lived
in
the
south
all
this
could
not
but
give
them
the
impression
of
a
clumsy
caricature
of
true
tradition
the
principal
doctrines
of
synagogue
and
church
had
apparently
been
misunderstood
or
they
were
simply
denied
as
corruptions
the
conversion
to
islâm
within
a
hundred
years
of
such
nations
as
the
egyptian
the
syrian
and
the
persian
can
hardly
be
attributed
to
anything
but
the
latent
talents
the
formerly
suppressed
energy
of
the
arabian
race
having
found
a
favourable
soil
for
its
development
talents
and
energy
however
not
of
a
missionary
kind
if
islâm
is
said
to
have
been
from
its
beginning
down
to
the
present
day
a
missionary
religion
then
mission
is
to
be
taken
here
in
a
quite
peculiar
sense
and
special
attention
must
be
given
to
the
preparation
of
the
missionary
field
by
the
moslim
armies
related
by
history
and
considered
as
most
important
by
the
mohammedans
themselves
footnote
with
extraordinary
talent
this
thesis
has
been
defended
by
professor
arnold
in
the
above
quoted
work
preaching
of
which
fully
deserves
the
attention
also
of
those
who
do
not
agree
with
the
writer
argument
among
the
many
objections
that
may
be
raised
against
arnold
conclusion
we
point
to
the
undeniable
fact
that
the
moslim
scholars
of
all
ages
hardly
speak
of
mission
at
all
and
always
treat
the
extension
of
the
true
faith
by
holy
war
as
one
of
the
principal
duties
of
the
moslim
community
certainly
the
nations
conquered
by
the
arabs
under
the
first
khalîfs
were
not
obliged
to
choose
between
living
as
moslims
or
dying
as
unbelievers
the
conquerors
treated
them
as
mohammed
had
treated
jews
and
christians
in
arabia
towards
the
end
of
his
life
and
only
exacted
from
them
submission
to
moslim
authority
they
were
allowed
to
adhere
to
their
religion
provided
they
helped
with
their
taxes
to
fill
the
moslim
exchequer
this
rule
was
even
extended
to
such
religions
as
that
of
the
parsîs
although
they
could
not
be
considered
as
belonging
to
the
people
of
scripture
expressly
recognized
in
the
qorân
but
the
social
condition
of
these
subjects
was
gradually
made
so
oppressive
by
the
mohammedan
masters
that
rapid
conversions
in
masses
were
a
natural
consequence
the
more
natural
because
among
the
conquered
nations
intellectual
culture
was
restricted
to
a
small
circle
so
that
after
the
conquest
their
spiritual
leaders
lacked
freedom
of
movement
besides
practically
very
little
was
required
from
the
new
converts
so
that
it
was
very
tempting
to
take
the
step
that
led
to
full
citizenship
no
those
who
in
a
short
time
subjected
millions
of
to
the
state
founded
by
mohammed
and
thus
prepared
their
conversion
were
no
apostles
they
were
generals
whose
strategic
talents
would
have
remained
hidden
but
for
mohammed
political
geniuses
especially
from
mecca
and
taif
who
before
islâm
would
have
excelled
only
in
the
organization
of
commercial
operations
or
in
establishing
harmony
between
hostile
families
now
they
proved
capable
of
uniting
the
arabs
commanded
by
allah
a
unity
still
many
a
time
endangered
during
the
first
century
by
the
old
party
spirit
and
of
devising
a
division
of
labour
between
the
rulers
and
the
conquered
which
made
it
possible
for
them
to
control
the
function
of
complicated
machines
of
state
without
any
technical
knowledge
moreover
several
circumstances
favoured
their
work
both
the
large
realms
which
extended
north
of
arabia
were
in
a
state
of
political
decline
the
christians
inhabiting
the
provinces
that
were
to
be
conquered
first
belonged
for
the
larger
part
to
heretical
sects
and
were
treated
by
the
orthodox
byzantines
in
such
a
way
that
other
masters
if
tolerant
might
be
welcome
the
arabian
armies
consisted
of
hardened
bedouins
with
few
wants
whose
longing
for
the
treasures
of
the
civilized
world
made
them
more
ready
to
endure
the
pressure
of
a
discipline
hitherto
unknown
to
them
the
use
that
the
leaders
made
of
the
occasion
commands
our
admiration
although
their
plan
was
formed
in
the
course
and
under
the
influence
of
generally
unforeseen
events
circumstances
had
changed
mohammed
the
prophet
into
mohammed
the
conqueror
and
the
leaders
who
continued
the
work
though
not
driven
by
fanaticism
or
religious
zeal
still
prepared
the
conversion
of
millions
of
men
to
islâm
it
was
only
natural
that
the
new
masters
adopted
with
certain
modifications
the
administrative
and
fiscal
systems
of
the
conquered
countries
for
similar
reasons
islâm
had
to
complete
its
spiritual
store
from
the
wealth
of
that
of
its
new
adherents
recent
research
shows
most
clearly
that
islâm
in
after
times
so
sharply
opposed
to
other
religions
and
so
strongly
armed
against
foreign
influence
in
the
first
century
borrowed
freely
and
simply
from
the
people
of
scripture
whatever
was
not
evidently
in
contradiction
to
the
qorân
this
was
to
be
expected
had
not
mohammed
from
the
very
beginning
referred
to
the
people
of
the
book
as
those
who
know
when
painful
experience
induced
him
afterwards
to
accuse
them
of
corruption
of
their
scriptures
this
attitude
necessitated
a
certain
criticism
but
not
rejection
of
their
tradition
the
ritual
only
provisionally
regulated
and
continually
liable
to
change
according
to
prophetic
inspiration
in
mohammed
lifetime
required
unalterable
rules
after
his
death
recent
studies
have
shown
in
an
astounding
way
that
the
jewish
ritual
together
with
the
religious
rites
of
the
christians
strongly
influenced
the
definite
shape
given
to
that
of
islâm
while
indirect
influence
of
the
parsî
religion
is
at
least
probable
footnote
the
studies
of
professors
becker
mittwoch
and
wensinck
especially
taken
in
connection
with
older
ones
of
ignaz
goldziher
have
thrown
much
light
upon
this
subject
so
much
for
the
rites
of
public
worship
and
the
ritual
purity
they
require
the
method
of
fasting
seems
to
follow
the
jewish
model
whereas
the
period
of
obligatory
fasting
depends
on
the
christian
usage
mohammed
fragmentary
and
unsystematic
accounts
of
sacred
history
were
freely
drawn
from
jewish
and
christian
sources
and
covered
the
whole
period
from
the
creation
of
the
world
until
the
first
centuries
of
the
christian
era
of
course
features
shocking
to
the
moslim
mind
were
dropped
and
the
whole
adapted
to
the
monotonous
conception
of
the
qorân
with
ever
greater
boldness
the
story
of
mohammed
own
life
was
exalted
to
the
sphere
of
the
supernatural
here
the
gospel
served
as
example
though
mohammed
had
repeatedly
declared
himself
to
be
an
ordinary
man
chosen
by
allah
as
the
organ
of
his
revelation
and
whose
only
miracle
was
the
qorân
posterity
ascribed
to
him
a
whole
series
of
wonders
evidently
invented
in
emulation
of
the
wonders
of
christ
the
reason
for
this
seems
to
have
been
the
idea
that
none
of
the
older
prophets
not
even
jesus
of
whom
the
qorân
tells
the
greatest
wonders
could
have
worked
a
miracle
without
mohammed
the
seal
of
the
prophets
having
rivalled
or
surpassed
him
in
this
respect
only
jesus
was
the
messiah
but
this
title
did
not
exceed
in
value
different
titles
of
other
prophets
and
mohammed
special
epithets
were
of
a
higher
order
a
relative
sinlessness
mohammed
shared
with
jesus
the
acceptance
of
this
doctrine
contradictory
to
the
original
spirit
of
the
qorân
had
moreover
a
dogmatic
motive
it
was
considered
indispensable
to
raise
the
text
of
the
qorân
above
all
suspicion
of
corruption
which
suspicion
would
not
be
excluded
if
the
organ
of
the
revelation
were
fallible
this
period
of
naively
adopting
institutions
doctrines
and
traditions
was
soon
followed
by
an
awakening
to
the
consciousness
that
islâm
could
not
well
absorb
any
more
of
such
foreign
elements
without
endangering
its
independent
character
then
a
sorting
began
and
the
assimilation
of
the
vast
amount
of
borrowed
matter
that
had
already
become
an
integral
part
of
islâm
was
completed
by
submitting
the
whole
to
a
peculiar
treatment
it
was
carefully
divested
of
all
marks
of
origin
and
labelled
so
that
henceforth
it
was
regarded
as
emanations
from
the
wisdom
of
the
arabian
prophet
for
which
his
followers
owed
no
thanks
to
foreigners
footnote
the
arabic
word
for
record
story
has
assumed
the
technical
meaning
of
tradition
concerning
the
words
and
deeds
of
mohammed
it
is
used
as
well
in
the
sense
of
a
single
record
of
this
sort
as
in
that
of
the
whole
body
of
sacred
traditions
at
first
it
was
only
at
medina
that
some
pious
people
occupied
themselves
with
registering
putting
in
order
and
systematizing
the
spiritual
property
of
islâm
afterwards
similar
circles
were
formed
in
other
centres
such
as
mecca
kufa
basra
misr
cairo
and
elsewhere
at
the
outset
the
collection
of
divine
sayings
the
qorân
was
the
only
guide
the
only
source
of
decisive
decrees
the
only
touchstone
of
what
was
true
or
false
allowed
or
forbidden
reluctantly
but
decidedly
at
last
it
was
conceded
that
the
foundations
laid
by
mohammed
for
the
life
of
his
community
were
by
no
means
all
to
be
found
in
the
holy
book
rather
that
revelations
without
his
explanation
and
practice
would
have
remained
an
enigma
it
was
understood
now
that
the
rules
and
laws
of
islâm
were
founded
on
god
word
and
on
the
sunnah
the
way
pointed
out
by
the
prophet
word
and
example
thus
it
had
been
from
the
moment
that
allah
had
caused
his
light
to
shine
over
arabia
and
thus
it
must
remain
if
human
error
was
not
to
corrupt
islâm
at
the
moment
when
this
conservative
instinct
began
to
assert
itself
among
the
spiritual
leaders
so
much
foreign
matter
had
already
been
incorporated
into
islâm
that
the
theory
of
the
sufficiency
of
qorân
and
sunnah
could
not
have
been
maintained
without
the
labelling
operation
which
we
have
alluded
to
so
it
was
assumed
that
as
surely
as
mohammed
must
have
surpassed
his
predecessors
in
perfection
and
in
wonders
so
surely
must
all
the
principles
and
precepts
necessary
for
his
community
have
been
formulated
by
him
thus
by
a
gigantic
web
of
fiction
he
became
after
his
death
the
organ
of
opinions
ideas
and
interests
whose
lawfulness
was
recognized
by
every
influential
section
of
the
faithful
all
that
could
not
be
identified
as
part
of
the
prophet
sunnah
received
no
recognition
on
the
other
hand
all
that
was
accepted
had
somehow
to
be
incorporated
into
the
sunnah
it
became
a
fundamental
dogma
of
islâm
that
the
sunnah
was
the
indispensable
completion
of
the
qorân
and
that
both
together
formed
the
source
of
mohammedan
law
and
doctrine
so
much
so
that
every
party
assumed
the
name
of
people
of
the
sunnah
to
express
its
pretension
to
orthodoxy
the
of
the
sunnah
however
was
the
subject
of
a
great
deal
of
controversy
so
that
it
came
to
be
considered
necessary
to
make
the
prophet
pronounce
his
authoritative
judgment
on
this
difference
of
opinion
he
was
said
to
have
called
it
a
proof
of
god
special
mercy
that
within
reasonable
limits
difference
of
opinion
was
allowed
in
his
community
of
that
privilege
mohammedans
have
always
amply
availed
themselves
when
the
difference
touched
on
political
questions
especially
on
the
succession
of
the
prophet
in
the
government
of
the
community
schism
was
the
inevitable
consequence
thus
arose
the
party
strifes
of
the
first
century
which
led
to
the
establishment
of
the
sects
of
the
and
the
khârijites
separate
communities
severed
from
the
great
whole
that
led
their
own
lives
and
therefore
followed
paths
different
from
those
of
the
majority
in
matters
of
doctrine
and
law
as
well
as
in
politics
the
sharpness
of
the
political
antithesis
served
to
accentuate
the
importance
of
the
other
differences
in
such
cases
and
to
debar
their
acceptance
as
the
legal
consequence
of
the
difference
of
opinion
that
god
mercy
allowed
that
the
political
factor
was
indeed
the
great
motive
of
separation
is
clearly
shown
in
our
own
day
now
that
one
mohammedan
state
after
the
other
sees
its
political
independence
disappearing
and
efforts
are
being
made
from
all
sides
to
the
unity
of
the
mohammedan
world
by
stimulating
the
feeling
of
religious
brotherhood
among
the
most
cultivated
moslims
of
different
countries
an
earnest
endeavour
is
gaining
ground
to
admit
khârijites
and
others
formerly
abused
as
heretics
into
the
great
community
now
threatened
by
common
foes
and
to
regard
their
special
tenets
in
the
same
way
as
the
differences
existing
between
the
four
law
schools
hanafites
mâlikites
and
hanbalites
which
for
centuries
have
been
considered
equally
orthodox
although
the
differences
that
divide
these
schools
at
first
caused
great
excitement
and
gave
rise
to
violent
discussions
the
strong
catholic
instinct
of
islâm
always
knew
how
to
prevent
schism
each
new
generation
either
found
the
golden
mean
between
the
extremes
which
had
divided
the
preceding
one
or
it
recognized
the
right
of
both
opinions
though
the
dogmatic
differences
were
not
necessarily
so
dangerous
to
unity
as
were
political
ones
yet
they
were
more
apt
to
cause
schism
than
discussions
about
the
law
it
was
essential
to
put
an
end
to
dissension
concerning
the
theological
roots
of
the
whole
system
of
islâm
mohammed
had
never
expressed
any
truth
in
dogmatic
form
all
systematic
thinking
was
foreign
to
his
nature
it
was
again
the
moslims
especially
those
of
christian
origin
who
suggested
such
doctrinal
questions
at
first
they
met
with
a
vehement
opposition
that
condemned
all
dogmatic
discussion
as
a
novelty
of
the
devil
in
the
long
run
however
the
contest
of
the
conservatives
against
specially
objectionable
features
of
the
discussions
forced
them
to
borrow
arms
from
the
dogmatic
arsenal
hence
a
method
with
a
peculiar
terminology
came
in
vogue
to
which
even
the
boldest
imagination
could
not
ascribe
any
connection
with
the
sunnah
of
mohammed
yet
some
traditions
ventured
to
put
prophetic
warnings
on
mohammed
lips
against
dogmatic
innovations
that
were
sure
to
arise
and
to
make
him
pronounce
the
names
of
a
couple
of
future
sects
but
no
one
dared
to
make
the
prophet
preach
an
orthodox
system
of
dogmatics
resulting
from
the
controversies
of
several
centuries
all
the
terms
of
which
were
foreign
to
the
arabic
speech
of
mohammed
time
indeed
all
the
subjects
which
had
given
rise
to
dogmatic
controversy
in
the
christian
church
except
some
too
specifically
christian
were
discussed
by
the
the
dogmatists
of
islâm
free
will
or
predestination
god
omnipotent
or
first
of
all
just
and
holy
god
word
created
by
him
or
sharing
his
eternity
god
one
in
this
sense
that
his
being
admitted
of
no
plurality
of
qualities
or
possessed
of
qualities
which
in
all
eternity
are
inherent
in
his
being
in
the
world
to
come
only
bliss
and
doom
or
also
an
intermediate
state
for
the
neutral
we
might
continue
the
enumeration
and
always
show
to
the
christian
or
theologian
old
acquaintances
in
moslim
garb
that
is
why
maracci
and
reland
could
understand
jews
and
christians
yielding
to
the
temptation
of
joining
islâm
and
that
also
explains
why
catholic
and
protestant
dogmatists
could
accuse
each
other
of
not
until
the
beginning
of
the
tenth
century
did
the
orthodox
mohammedan
dogma
begin
to
emerge
from
the
clash
of
opinions
into
its
definite
shape
the
had
advocated
man
free
will
had
given
prominence
to
justice
and
holiness
in
their
conception
of
god
had
denied
distinct
qualities
in
god
and
the
eternity
of
god
word
had
accepted
a
place
for
the
neutral
between
paradise
and
hell
and
for
some
time
the
favour
of
the
powers
in
authority
seemed
to
assure
the
victory
of
their
system
contradicted
all
these
points
and
his
system
has
in
the
end
been
adopted
by
the
great
majority
the
doctrines
for
a
long
time
still
enthralled
many
minds
but
they
ended
by
taking
refuge
in
the
political
heresy
of
in
the
most
conservative
circles
opponents
to
all
speculation
were
never
wanting
but
they
were
obliged
unconsciously
to
make
large
concessions
to
systematic
thought
for
in
the
moslim
world
as
elsewhere
religious
belief
without
dogma
had
become
as
impossible
as
breathing
is
without
air
thus
in
islâm
a
whole
system
which
could
not
even
pretend
to
draw
its
authority
from
the
sunnah
had
come
to
be
accepted
it
was
not
difficult
to
justify
this
deviation
from
the
orthodox
abhorrence
against
novelties
islâm
has
always
looked
at
the
world
in
a
pessimistic
way
a
view
expressed
in
numberless
prophetic
sayings
the
world
is
bad
and
will
become
worse
and
worse
religion
and
morality
will
have
to
wage
an
ever
more
hopeless
war
against
unbelief
against
heresy
and
ungodly
ways
of
living
while
this
is
surely
no
reason
for
entering
into
any
compromise
with
doctrines
which
depart
but
a
hair
breadth
from
qorân
and
sunnah
it
necessitates
methods
of
defence
against
heresy
as
unknown
in
mohammed
time
as
heresy
itself
necessity
knows
no
law
is
a
principle
fully
accepted
in
islam
and
heresy
is
an
enemy
of
the
faith
that
can
only
be
defeated
with
dialectic
weapons
so
the
religious
truths
preached
by
mohammed
have
not
been
altered
in
any
way
but
under
the
stress
of
necessity
they
have
been
clad
in
modern
armour
which
has
somewhat
changed
their
aspect
moreover
islâm
has
a
theory
which
alone
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
whole
later
development
of
doctrine
as
well
as
of
law
this
theory
whose
importance
for
the
system
can
hardly
be
overestimated
and
which
nevertheless
has
until
very
recent
times
constantly
been
overlooked
by
western
students
of
islâm
finds
its
classical
expression
in
the
following
words
put
into
the
mouth
of
mohammed
my
community
will
never
agree
in
an
error
in
terms
more
familiar
to
us
this
means
that
the
mohammedan
church
taken
as
a
whole
is
infallible
that
all
the
decisions
on
matters
practical
or
theoretical
on
which
it
is
agreed
are
binding
upon
its
members
nowhere
else
is
the
catholic
instinct
of
islâm
more
clearly
expressed
a
faithful
mohammedan
student
after
having
struggled
through
a
handbook
of
law
may
be
vexed
by
a
doubt
as
to
whether
these
endless
casuistic
precepts
have
been
rightly
deduced
from
the
qorân
and
the
sacred
tradition
his
doubt
however
will
at
once
be
silenced
if
he
bears
in
mind
that
allah
speaks
more
plainly
to
him
by
this
infallible
agreement
of
the
community
than
through
qorân
and
tradition
nay
that
the
contents
of
both
those
sacred
sources
without
this
perfect
intermediary
would
be
to
a
great
extent
unintelligible
to
him
even
the
differences
between
the
schools
of
law
may
be
based
on
this
theory
of
the
ijmâ
for
does
not
the
infallible
agreement
of
the
community
teach
us
that
a
certain
diversity
of
opinion
is
a
merciful
gift
of
god
it
was
through
the
agreement
that
dogmatic
speculations
as
well
as
minute
discussions
about
points
of
law
became
legitimate
the
stamp
of
ijmâ
was
essential
to
every
rule
of
faith
and
life
to
all
manners
and
customs
all
sorts
of
religious
ideas
and
practices
which
could
not
possibly
be
deduced
from
mohammed
message
entered
the
moslim
world
by
the
permission
of
ijmâ
here
we
need
think
only
of
mysticism
and
of
the
cult
of
saints
some
passages
of
the
qorân
may
perhaps
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
that
we
hear
the
subtler
strings
of
religious
emotion
vibrating
in
them
the
chief
impression
that
mohammed
allah
makes
before
the
hijrah
is
that
of
awful
majesty
at
which
men
tremble
from
afar
they
fear
his
punishment
dare
hardly
be
sure
of
his
reward
and
hope
much
from
his
mercy
this
impression
is
a
lasting
one
but
after
the
hijrah
allah
is
also
heard
quietly
reasoning
with
his
obedient
servants
giving
them
advice
and
commands
which
they
have
to
follow
in
order
to
frustrate
all
resistance
to
his
authority
and
to
deserve
his
satisfaction
he
is
always
the
lord
the
king
of
the
world
who
speaks
to
his
humble
servants
but
the
lamp
which
allah
had
caused
mohammed
to
hold
up
to
guide
mankind
with
its
light
was
raised
higher
and
higher
after
the
prophet
death
in
order
to
shed
its
light
over
an
ever
increasing
part
of
humanity
this
was
not
possible
however
without
its
reservoir
being
replenished
with
all
the
different
kinds
of
oil
that
had
from
time
immemorial
given
light
to
those
different
nations
the
oil
of
mysticism
came
from
christian
circles
and
its
origin
was
quite
unmistakable
persia
and
india
also
contributed
to
it
there
were
those
who
by
asceticism
by
different
methods
of
mortifying
the
flesh
liberated
the
spirit
that
it
might
rise
and
become
united
with
the
origin
of
all
being
to
such
an
extent
that
with
some
the
profession
of
faith
was
reduced
to
the
blasphemous
exclamation
i
am
allah
others
tried
to
become
free
from
the
sphere
of
the
material
and
the
temporal
by
certain
methods
of
thought
combined
or
not
combined
with
asceticism
here
the
necessity
of
guidance
was
felt
and
congregations
came
into
existence
whose
purpose
it
was
to
permit
large
groups
of
people
under
the
leadership
of
their
sheikhs
to
participate
simultaneously
in
the
mystic
union
the
influence
which
spread
most
widely
was
that
of
leaders
like
ghazâlî
the
father
of
the
later
mohammedan
church
who
recommended
moral
purification
of
the
soul
as
the
only
way
by
which
men
should
come
nearer
to
god
his
mysticism
wished
to
avoid
the
danger
of
pantheism
to
which
so
many
others
were
led
by
their
contemplations
and
which
so
often
engendered
disregard
of
the
revealed
law
or
even
of
morality
some
wanted
to
pass
over
the
gap
between
the
creator
and
the
created
along
a
bridge
of
contemplation
and
so
driven
by
the
fire
of
sublime
passion
precipitate
themselves
towards
the
object
of
their
love
in
a
kind
of
rapture
which
poets
compare
with
intoxication
the
evil
world
said
that
the
impossibility
to
accomplish
this
heavenly
union
often
induced
those
people
to
imitate
it
for
the
time
being
with
the
earthly
means
of
wine
and
the
indulgence
in
sensual
love
characteristic
of
all
these
sorts
of
mysticism
is
their
esoteric
pride
all
those
emotions
are
meant
only
for
a
small
number
of
chosen
ones
even
ghazâlî
ethical
mysticism
is
not
for
the
multitude
the
development
of
islâm
as
a
whole
from
the
hijrah
on
has
always
been
greater
in
breadth
than
in
depth
and
consequently
its
pedagogics
have
remained
defective
even
some
of
the
noblest
minds
in
islâm
restrict
true
religious
life
to
an
aristocracy
and
accept
the
ignorance
of
the
multitude
as
an
irremediable
evil
throughout
the
centuries
pantheistic
and
animistic
forms
of
mysticism
have
found
many
adherents
among
the
mohammedans
but
the
infallible
agreement
has
persisted
in
calling
that
heresy
ethical
mysticism
since
ghazâlî
has
been
fully
recognized
and
with
law
and
dogma
it
forms
the
sacred
trio
of
sciences
of
islâm
to
the
study
of
which
the
arabic
humanistic
arts
serve
as
preparatory
instruments
all
other
sciences
however
useful
and
necessary
are
of
this
world
and
have
no
value
for
the
world
to
come
the
unfaithful
appreciate
and
study
them
as
well
as
do
the
mohammedans
but
on
mohammedan
soil
they
must
be
coloured
with
a
mohammedan
hue
and
their
results
may
never
clash
with
the
three
religious
sciences
physics
astronomy
and
philosophy
have
often
found
it
difficult
to
observe
this
restriction
and
therefore
they
used
to
be
at
least
slightly
suspected
in
pious
circles
mysticism
did
not
only
owe
to
ijmâ
its
place
in
the
sacred
trio
but
it
succeeded
better
than
dogmatics
in
confirming
its
right
with
words
of
allah
and
his
prophet
in
islâm
mysticism
and
allegory
are
allied
in
the
usual
way
for
the
the
words
had
quite
a
different
meaning
than
for
common
people
so
the
qorân
was
made
to
speak
the
language
of
mysticism
and
mystic
commentaries
of
the
holy
book
exist
which
with
total
disregard
for
philological
and
historical
objections
explain
the
verses
of
the
revelation
as
expressions
of
the
profoundest
soul
experiences
clear
utterances
in
this
spirit
were
put
into
the
mouth
and
like
the
canonists
the
leaders
on
the
mystic
way
to
god
boasted
of
a
spiritual
genealogy
which
went
back
to
mohammed
thus
the
prophet
is
said
to
have
declared
void
all
knowledge
and
fulfillment
of
the
law
which
lacks
mystic
experience
of
course
only
true
mysticism
is
justified
by
ijmâ
and
confirmed
by
the
evidence
of
qorân
and
sunnah
but
about
the
bounds
between
true
and
false
or
heretical
mysticism
there
exists
in
a
large
measure
the
diversity
of
opinion
allowed
by
god
grace
the
ethical
mysticism
of
is
generally
recognized
as
orthodox
and
the
possibility
of
attaining
to
a
higher
spiritual
sphere
by
means
of
methodic
asceticism
and
contemplation
is
doubted
by
few
the
following
opinion
has
come
to
prevail
in
wide
circles
the
law
offers
the
bread
of
life
to
all
the
faithful
the
dogmatics
are
the
arsenal
from
which
the
weapons
must
be
taken
to
defend
the
treasures
of
religion
against
unbelief
and
heresy
but
mysticism
shows
the
earthly
pilgrim
the
way
to
heaven
it
was
a
much
lower
need
that
assured
the
cult
of
saints
a
place
in
the
doctrine
and
practice
of
islâm
as
strange
as
is
mohammed
transformation
from
an
ordinary
son
of
man
which
he
wanted
to
be
into
the
incarnation
of
divine
light
as
the
later
biographers
represent
him
it
is
still
more
astounding
that
the
intercession
of
saints
should
have
become
indispensable
to
the
community
of
mohammed
who
according
to
tradition
cursed
the
jews
and
christians
because
they
worshipped
the
shrines
of
their
prophets
almost
every
moslim
village
has
its
patron
saint
every
country
has
its
national
saints
every
province
of
human
life
has
its
own
human
rulers
who
are
intermediate
between
the
creator
and
common
mortals
in
no
other
particular
has
islâm
more
fully
accommodated
itself
to
the
religions
it
supplanted
the
popular
practice
which
is
in
many
cases
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
polytheism
was
to
a
great
extent
favoured
by
the
theory
of
the
intercession
of
the
pious
dead
of
whose
friendly
assistance
people
might
assure
themselves
by
doing
good
deeds
in
their
names
and
to
their
eternal
advantage
the
ordinary
moslim
visitor
of
the
graves
of
saints
does
not
trouble
himself
with
this
ingenious
compromise
between
the
severe
monotheism
of
his
prophet
and
the
polytheism
of
his
ancestors
he
is
firmly
convinced
that
the
best
way
to
obtain
the
satisfaction
of
his
desire
after
earthly
or
heavenly
goods
is
to
give
the
saint
whose
special
care
these
are
what
he
likes
best
and
he
confidently
leaves
it
to
the
venerated
one
to
settle
the
matter
with
allah
who
is
far
too
high
above
the
ordinary
mortal
to
allow
of
direct
contact
in
support
even
of
this
startling
deviation
from
the
original
traditions
have
been
devised
moreover
the
veneration
of
human
beings
was
favoured
by
some
forms
of
mysticism
for
like
many
saints
many
mystics
had
their
eccentricities
and
it
was
much
to
the
advantage
of
mystic
theologians
if
the
vulgar
could
be
persuaded
to
accept
their
aberrations
from
normal
rules
of
life
as
peculiarities
of
holy
men
but
ijmâ
did
more
even
than
tradition
and
mysticism
to
make
the
veneration
of
legions
of
saints
possible
in
the
temples
of
the
very
men
who
were
obliged
by
their
ritual
law
to
say
to
allah
several
time
daily
thee
only
do
we
worship
and
to
thee
alone
do
we
cry
for
help
in
the
tenth
century
of
our
era
islâm
process
of
accommodation
was
finished
in
all
its
essentials
from
this
time
forward
if
circumstances
were
favourable
it
could
continue
the
execution
of
its
world
conquering
plans
without
being
compelled
to
assimilate
any
more
foreign
elements
against
each
spiritual
asset
that
another
universal
religion
could
boast
it
could
now
put
forward
something
of
a
similar
nature
but
which
still
showed
characteristics
of
its
own
and
the
superiority
of
which
it
could
sustain
by
arguments
perfectly
satisfactory
to
its
followers
from
that
time
on
islâm
strove
to
distinguish
itself
ever
more
sharply
from
its
most
important
rivals
there
was
no
absolute
stagnation
the
evolution
was
not
entirely
stopped
but
it
moved
at
a
much
quieter
pace
and
its
direction
was
governed
by
internal
motives
not
by
influences
from
outside
moslim
catholicism
had
attained
its
full
growth
we
can
not
within
the
small
compass
of
these
lectures
consider
the
excrescences
of
the
normal
islâm
the
ultras
who
venerated
certain
descendants
of
mohammed
as
infallible
rulers
of
the
world
qarmatians
assassins
nor
the
modern
bastards
of
islâm
such
as
the
sheikhites
the
bâbî
the
who
have
found
some
adherents
in
america
and
other
sects
which
indeed
sprang
up
on
moslim
soil
but
deliberately
turned
to
sources
for
their
inspirations
we
must
draw
attention
however
to
protests
raised
by
certain
minorities
against
some
of
the
ideas
and
practices
which
had
been
definitely
adopted
by
the
majority
in
the
midst
of
mohammedan
catholicism
there
always
lived
and
moved
more
or
less
freely
protestant
elements
the
comparison
may
even
be
continued
with
certain
qualifications
and
we
may
speak
also
of
a
conservative
and
of
a
liberal
protestantism
in
islâm
the
conservative
protestantism
is
represented
by
the
hanbalitic
school
and
kindred
spirits
who
most
emphatically
preached
that
the
agreement
ijmâ
of
every
period
should
be
based
on
that
of
the
pious
ancestors
they
therefore
tested
every
dogma
and
practice
by
the
words
and
deeds
of
the
prophet
his
contemporaries
and
the
leaders
of
the
community
in
the
first
decades
after
mohammed
death
in
their
eyes
the
church
of
later
days
had
degenerated
and
they
declined
to
consider
the
agreement
of
its
doctors
as
justifying
the
penetration
into
islâm
of
ideas
and
usages
of
foreign
origin
the
cult
of
saints
was
rejected
by
them
as
altogether
contradictory
to
the
qorân
and
the
genuine
tradition
these
protestants
of
islâm
may
be
compared
to
those
of
christianity
also
in
this
respect
that
they
accepted
the
results
of
the
evolution
and
assimilation
of
the
first
three
centuries
of
islâm
but
rejected
later
additions
as
abuse
and
corruption
when
on
the
verge
of
our
nineteenth
century
they
tried
as
true
moslims
to
force
by
material
means
their
religious
conceptions
on
others
they
were
combated
as
heretics
by
the
authorities
of
catholic
islâm
central
and
western
arabia
formed
the
battlefield
on
which
these
zealots
called
wahhâbites
after
their
leader
were
defeated
by
mohammed
ali
the
first
khedive
and
his
egyptian
army
since
they
have
given
up
their
efforts
at
violent
reconstitution
of
what
they
consider
to
be
the
original
islâm
they
are
left
alone
and
their
ideas
have
found
adherents
far
outside
arabia
in
british
india
and
in
northern
and
central
africa
in
still
quite
another
way
many
moslims
who
found
their
freedom
of
thought
or
action
impeded
by
the
prevailing
law
and
doctrine
have
returned
to
the
origin
of
their
religion
too
much
attached
to
the
traditions
of
their
faith
deliberately
to
disregard
these
impediments
they
tried
to
find
in
the
qorân
and
tradition
arguments
in
favour
of
what
was
dictated
to
them
by
reason
and
they
found
those
arguments
as
easily
as
former
generations
had
found
the
bases
on
which
to
erect
their
casuistry
their
dogma
and
their
mysticism
this
implied
an
interpretation
of
the
oldest
sources
independent
from
the
catholic
development
of
islâm
and
in
contradiction
with
the
general
opinion
of
the
canonists
according
to
whom
since
the
fourth
or
fifth
century
of
the
hijrah
no
one
is
qualified
for
such
free
research
a
certain
degree
of
independence
of
mind
together
with
a
strong
attachment
to
their
spiritual
past
has
given
rise
in
the
moslim
world
to
this
sort
of
liberal
protestantism
which
in
our
age
has
many
adherents
among
the
mohammedans
who
have
come
in
contact
with
modern
civilization
that
the
partisans
of
all
these
different
conceptions
could
remain
together
as
the
children
of
one
spiritual
family
is
largely
owing
to
the
elastic
character
of
ijmâ
the
importance
of
which
is
to
some
extent
acknowledged
by
catholics
and
protestants
by
moderns
and
conservatives
it
has
never
been
contested
that
the
community
whose
agreement
was
the
test
of
truth
should
not
consist
of
the
faithful
masses
but
of
the
expert
elect
in
a
christian
church
we
should
have
spoken
of
the
clergy
with
a
further
definition
of
the
organs
through
which
it
was
to
express
itself
synod
council
or
pope
islâm
has
no
clergy
as
we
have
seen
the
qualification
of
a
man
to
have
his
own
opinion
depends
entirely
upon
the
scope
of
his
knowledge
or
rather
of
his
erudition
there
is
no
lack
of
standards
fixed
by
mohammedan
authorities
in
which
the
requirements
for
a
scholar
to
qualify
him
for
ijmâ
are
detailed
the
principal
criterion
is
the
knowledge
of
the
canon
law
quite
what
we
should
expect
from
the
history
of
the
evolution
of
islâm
but
of
course
dogmatists
and
mystics
had
also
their
own
agreements
on
the
questions
concerning
them
and
through
the
compromise
between
law
dogma
and
mysticism
there
could
not
fail
to
come
into
existence
a
kind
of
mixed
ijmâ
moreover
the
standards
and
definitions
could
have
only
a
certain
theoretical
value
as
there
never
has
existed
a
body
that
could
speak
in
the
name
of
all
the
decisions
of
were
therefore
to
be
ascertained
only
in
a
vague
and
general
way
the
speakers
were
individuals
whose
own
authority
depended
on
ijmâ
whereas
ijmâ
should
have
been
their
collective
decision
thus
it
was
possible
for
innumerable
shades
of
catholicism
and
protestantism
to
live
under
one
roof
with
a
good
deal
of
friction
it
is
true
but
without
definite
breach
or
schism
no
one
sect
being
able
to
eject
another
from
the
community
moslim
political
authorities
are
bound
not
only
to
extend
the
domain
of
islâm
but
also
to
keep
the
community
in
the
right
path
in
its
life
and
doctrine
this
task
they
have
always
conceived
in
accordance
with
their
political
interests
islâm
has
had
its
religious
persecutions
but
tolerance
was
very
usual
and
even
official
favouring
of
heresy
not
quite
exceptional
with
moslim
rulers
regular
maintenance
of
religious
discipline
existed
nowhere
thus
in
the
bond
of
political
obedience
elements
which
might
otherwise
have
been
scattered
were
held
together
the
political
decay
of
islâm
in
our
a
day
has
done
away
with
what
had
been
left
of
official
power
to
settle
religious
differences
and
any
organization
of
spiritual
authority
never
existed
hence
it
is
only
natural
that
the
diversity
of
opinion
allowed
by
the
grace
of
allah
now
shows
itself
on
a
greater
scale
than
ever
before
iii
the
political
development
of
islâm
in
the
first
period
of
islâm
the
functions
of
what
we
call
church
and
what
we
call
state
were
exercised
by
the
same
authority
its
political
development
is
therefore
of
great
importance
for
the
understanding
of
its
religious
growth
the
prophet
when
he
spoke
in
the
name
of
god
was
the
lawgiver
of
his
community
and
it
was
rightly
understood
by
the
later
faithful
that
his
indispensable
explanations
of
god
word
had
also
legislative
power
from
the
time
of
the
hijrah
the
nature
of
the
case
made
him
the
ruler
the
judge
and
the
military
commander
of
his
theocratic
state
moreover
allah
expressly
demanded
of
the
moslims
that
they
should
obey
the
messenger
of
god
and
those
amongst
them
who
have
authority
we
see
by
this
expression
that
mohammed
shared
his
temporal
authority
with
others
his
were
not
appointed
their
number
was
nowhere
defined
they
were
not
a
closed
circle
they
were
the
notables
of
the
tribes
or
other
groups
who
had
arrayed
themselves
under
mohammed
authority
and
a
few
who
had
gained
influence
by
their
personality
in
their
councils
mohammed
word
had
no
decisive
power
except
when
he
spoke
in
the
name
of
allah
and
we
know
how
careful
he
was
to
give
oracles
only
in
cases
of
extreme
need
footnote
qorân
in
the
last
years
of
mohammed
life
his
authority
became
extended
over
a
large
part
of
arabia
but
he
did
very
little
in
the
way
of
centralization
of
government
he
sent
agents
to
the
conquered
tribes
or
villages
who
had
to
see
that
in
the
first
place
the
most
important
regulations
of
the
qorân
were
followed
and
secondly
that
the
tax
into
which
the
duty
of
almsgiving
had
been
converted
was
promptly
paid
and
that
the
portion
of
it
intended
for
the
central
fund
at
medina
was
duly
delivered
after
the
great
conquests
the
governors
of
provinces
of
the
moslim
empire
who
often
exercised
a
despotic
power
were
called
by
the
same
title
of
the
agents
of
mohammed
however
did
not
possess
such
unlimited
authority
it
was
only
gradually
that
the
arabs
learned
the
value
of
good
discipline
and
submission
to
a
strong
guidance
and
adopted
the
forms
of
orderly
government
as
they
found
them
in
the
conquered
lands
through
the
death
of
mohammed
everything
became
uncertain
the
combination
under
one
leadership
of
such
a
heterogeneous
mass
as
that
of
his
arabs
would
have
been
unthinkable
a
few
years
before
it
became
quite
natural
though
as
soon
as
the
prophet
mouth
was
recognized
as
the
organ
of
allah
voice
must
this
monarchy
be
continued
after
allah
mouthpiece
had
ceased
to
exist
it
was
not
at
all
certain
the
force
of
circumstances
and
the
energy
of
some
of
mohammed
counsellors
soon
led
to
the
necessary
decisions
a
number
of
the
notables
of
the
community
succeeded
in
forcing
upon
the
hesitating
or
unwilling
members
the
acceptance
of
the
monarchy
as
a
permanent
institution
there
must
be
a
khalîf
a
deputy
of
the
prophet
in
all
his
functions
except
that
of
messenger
of
god
who
would
be
ruler
and
judge
and
leader
of
public
worship
but
above
all
commander
of
the
faithful
in
the
struggle
both
against
the
apostate
arabs
and
against
the
hostile
tribes
on
the
northern
border
but
for
the
military
success
of
the
first
khalifs
islâm
would
never
have
become
a
universal
religion
every
exertion
was
made
to
keep
the
troops
of
the
faithful
complete
the
leaders
followed
only
mohammed
example
when
they
represented
fighting
for
allah
cause
as
the
most
enviable
occupation
the
duty
of
military
service
was
constantly
impressed
upon
the
moslims
the
lust
of
booty
and
the
desire
for
martyrdom
to
which
the
qorân
assigned
the
highest
reward
were
excited
to
the
utmost
at
a
later
period
it
became
necessary
in
the
interests
of
order
to
temper
the
result
of
this
excitement
by
traditions
in
which
those
of
the
faithful
who
died
in
the
exercise
of
a
peaceful
honest
profession
were
declared
to
be
witnesses
to
the
faith
as
well
as
those
who
were
slain
in
battle
against
the
enemies
of
god
traditions
in
which
the
real
and
greater
holy
war
was
described
as
the
struggle
against
evil
passions
the
necessity
of
such
a
mitigating
reaction
the
spirit
in
which
the
chapters
on
holy
war
of
mohammedan
lawbooks
are
conceived
and
the
galvanizing
power
which
down
to
our
own
day
is
contained
in
a
call
to
arms
in
the
name
of
allah
all
this
shows
that
in
the
beginning
of
islâm
the
love
of
battle
had
been
instigated
at
the
expense
of
everything
else
the
institution
of
the
khalifate
had
hardly
been
agreed
upon
when
the
question
of
who
should
occupy
it
became
the
subject
of
violent
dissension
the
first
four
khalîfs
whose
reigns
occupied
the
first
thirty
years
after
mohammed
death
were
qoraishites
tribesmen
of
the
prophet
and
moreover
men
who
had
been
his
intimate
friends
the
sacred
tradition
relates
a
saying
of
mohammed
the
are
from
qoraish
intended
to
confine
the
khalifate
to
men
from
that
tribe
history
however
shows
that
this
edict
was
forged
to
give
the
stamp
of
legality
to
the
results
of
a
long
political
struggle
for
at
mohammed
death
the
medinese
began
fiercely
contesting
the
claims
of
the
qoraishites
and
during
the
reign
of
alî
the
fourth
khalîf
the
khârijites
rebelled
demanding
as
democratic
rigorists
the
free
election
of
khalîfs
without
restriction
to
the
tribe
of
qoraish
or
to
any
other
descent
their
standard
of
requirements
contained
only
religious
and
moral
qualities
and
they
claimed
for
the
community
the
continual
control
of
the
chosen
leader
behaviour
and
the
right
of
deposing
him
as
soon
as
they
found
him
failing
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
duties
their
anarchistic
revolutions
which
during
more
than
a
century
occasionally
gave
much
trouble
to
the
khalifate
caused
islâm
to
accentuate
the
aristocratic
character
of
its
monarchy
they
were
overcome
and
reduced
to
a
sect
the
survivors
of
which
still
exist
in
arabia
in
zanzibar
and
in
northern
africa
however
the
actual
life
of
these
communities
resembles
that
of
their
spiritual
forefathers
to
a
very
remote
degree
another
democratic
doctrine
still
more
radical
than
that
of
the
khârijites
makes
even
eligible
for
the
khalifate
it
must
have
had
a
considerable
number
of
adherents
for
the
tradition
which
makes
the
prophet
responsible
for
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
canonic
collections
later
generations
however
rendered
it
harmless
by
exegesis
they
maintained
that
in
this
text
commander
meant
only
subordinate
chiefs
and
not
the
commander
of
the
faithful
it
became
a
dogma
in
the
orthodox
mohammedan
world
respected
up
to
the
sixteenth
century
that
only
members
of
the
tribe
of
qoraish
could
take
the
place
of
the
messenger
of
god
the
chance
of
success
was
greater
for
the
legitimists
than
for
the
democratic
party
the
former
wished
to
make
the
khalifate
the
privilege
of
alî
the
cousin
and
of
the
prophet
and
his
descendants
at
first
the
community
did
not
take
much
notice
of
that
house
of
mohammed
and
it
did
not
occur
to
any
one
to
give
them
a
special
part
in
the
direction
of
affairs
alî
and
fâtima
themselves
asked
to
be
placed
in
possession
only
of
certain
goods
which
had
belonged
to
mohammed
but
which
the
first
khalîfs
would
not
allow
to
be
regarded
as
his
personal
property
they
maintained
that
the
prophet
had
had
the
disposal
of
them
not
as
owner
but
as
head
of
the
state
this
narrow
greed
and
absence
of
political
insight
seemed
to
be
hereditary
in
the
descendants
of
ali
and
fâtima
for
there
was
no
lack
of
superstitious
reverence
for
them
in
later
times
and
if
one
of
them
had
possessed
something
of
the
political
talent
of
the
best
omayyads
and
abbasids
he
would
certainly
have
been
able
to
supplant
them
after
the
third
khalîf
othmân
had
been
murdered
by
his
political
opponents
ali
became
his
successor
but
he
was
more
remote
than
any
of
his
predecessors
from
enjoying
general
sympathy
at
that
time
the
the
party
of
the
house
of
the
prophet
gradually
arose
which
maintained
that
ali
should
have
been
the
first
khalîf
and
that
his
descendants
should
succeed
him
the
veneration
felt
for
those
descendants
increased
in
the
same
proportion
as
that
for
the
prophet
himself
and
moreover
there
were
at
all
times
malcontents
whose
advantage
would
be
in
joining
any
revolution
against
the
existing
government
yet
the
alids
never
succeeded
in
accomplishing
anything
against
the
dynasties
of
the
omayyads
the
abbasids
and
the
ottomans
except
in
a
few
cases
of
transitory
importance
only
the
fatimite
dynasty
of
rather
doubtful
descent
which
ruled
a
part
of
northern
africa
and
egypt
in
the
tenth
century
was
completely
suppressed
after
some
two
and
a
half
centuries
the
sherîfs
who
have
ruled
morocco
for
more
than
years
were
not
chiefs
of
a
party
that
considered
the
legality
of
their
leadership
a
dogma
they
owe
their
local
khalifate
far
more
to
the
position
of
their
country
which
prevented
abbasids
and
turks
from
meddling
with
their
affairs
otherwise
they
would
have
been
obliged
at
any
rate
to
acknowledge
the
sovereignty
of
the
great
lord
of
constantinople
this
was
the
case
with
the
sherîfs
of
mecca
who
ever
since
the
twelfth
century
have
regarded
the
sacred
territory
as
their
domain
their
principality
arose
out
of
the
general
political
disturbance
and
the
division
of
the
mohammedan
empire
into
a
number
of
kingdoms
whose
mutual
strife
prevented
them
from
undertaking
military
operations
in
the
desert
these
sherîfs
raised
no
claim
to
the
khalifate
and
the
tendencies
they
displayed
in
the
middle
ages
had
no
political
significance
although
they
had
intimate
relations
with
the
zaidites
of
southern
arabia
as
first
egypt
and
afterwards
turkey
made
their
protectorate
over
the
holy
cities
more
effective
the
princes
of
mecca
became
orthodox
the
zaidites
who
settled
in
yemen
from
the
ninth
century
on
are
really
although
of
the
most
moderate
kind
without
striving
after
expansion
outside
arabia
they
firmly
refuse
to
give
up
their
own
khalifate
and
to
acknowledge
the
sovereignty
of
any
ruler
the
efforts
of
the
turks
to
subdue
them
or
to
make
a
compromise
with
them
have
had
no
lasting
results
this
is
the
principal
obstacle
against
their
being
included
in
the
orthodox
community
although
their
admission
is
defended
even
under
present
circumstances
by
many
moslim
scholars
the
zaidites
are
the
remnant
of
the
original
arabian
which
for
centuries
has
counted
adherents
in
all
parts
of
the
moslim
world
and
some
of
whose
tenets
have
penetrated
mohammedan
orthodoxy
the
almost
general
veneration
of
the
sayyids
and
sherîfs
as
the
descendants
of
mohammed
are
entitled
is
due
to
this
influence
the
outside
arabia
whose
adherents
used
to
be
persecuted
by
the
official
authorities
not
without
good
cause
became
the
receptacle
of
all
the
revolutionary
and
heterodox
ideas
maintained
by
the
converted
peoples
alongside
of
the
political
history
of
islâm
of
the
first
centuries
these
circles
built
up
their
evolution
of
the
community
the
only
true
one
guided
by
the
holy
family
and
the
reality
was
to
them
a
continuous
denial
of
the
postulates
of
religion
their
first
or
successor
of
the
prophet
was
alî
whose
divine
right
had
been
unjustly
denied
by
the
three
usurpers
abu
bakr
omar
and
othmân
and
who
had
exercised
actual
authority
for
a
few
years
in
constant
strife
with
khârijites
and
omayyads
the
efforts
of
his
legitimate
successors
to
assert
their
authority
were
constantly
drowned
in
blood
until
at
last
there
were
no
more
candidates
for
the
dangerous
office
this
prosaic
fact
was
converted
by
the
adherents
of
the
house
of
mohammed
into
the
romance
that
the
last
of
a
line
of
according
to
some
and
according
to
others
had
disappeared
in
a
mysterious
way
to
return
at
the
end
of
days
as
mahdî
the
guided
one
who
should
restore
the
political
order
which
had
been
disturbed
ever
since
mohammed
death
until
his
reappearance
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
community
to
do
but
to
await
his
advent
under
the
guidance
of
their
secular
rulers
the
shâhs
of
persia
and
enlightened
by
their
authoritative
scholars
who
explain
faith
and
law
to
them
from
the
tradition
of
the
sacred
family
the
great
majority
of
mohammedans
as
they
do
not
accept
this
legitimist
theory
are
counted
by
the
outside
arabia
as
unclean
heretics
if
not
as
unbelievers
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
this
found
its
political
centre
in
persia
and
opposed
itself
fanatically
to
the
sultan
of
turkey
who
at
about
the
same
time
came
to
stand
at
the
head
of
orthodox
islâm
all
differences
of
doctrine
were
now
sharpened
and
embittered
by
political
passion
and
the
efforts
of
single
enlightened
princes
or
scholars
to
induce
the
various
peoples
to
extend
to
each
other
across
the
political
barriers
the
hand
of
brotherhood
in
the
principles
of
faith
all
failed
it
is
only
in
the
last
few
years
that
the
general
political
distress
of
islâm
has
inclined
the
estranged
relatives
towards
reconciliation
besides
the
veneration
of
the
alids
orthodox
islâm
has
adopted
another
shîitic
element
the
expectation
of
the
mahdî
which
we
have
just
mentioned
most
sunnites
expect
that
at
the
end
of
the
world
there
will
come
from
the
house
of
mohammed
a
successor
to
him
guided
by
allah
who
will
maintain
the
revealed
law
as
faithfully
as
the
first
four
khalîfs
did
according
to
the
idealized
history
and
who
will
succeed
with
god
help
in
making
islâm
victorious
over
the
whole
world
that
the
chiliastic
kingdom
of
the
mahdî
must
in
the
end
be
destroyed
by
in
order
that
jesus
may
be
able
once
more
to
the
holy
order
before
the
resurrection
was
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
amalgamation
of
the
political
expectations
formed
under
influence
with
eschatological
conceptions
formerly
borrowed
by
islâm
from
christianity
the
orthodox
mahdî
differs
from
that
of
the
in
many
ways
he
is
not
an
returning
after
centuries
of
disappearance
but
a
descendant
of
mohammed
coming
into
the
world
in
the
ordinary
way
to
fulfill
the
ideal
of
the
khalifate
he
does
not
the
legitimate
line
of
successors
of
the
prophet
but
he
renews
the
glorious
tradition
of
the
khalifate
which
after
the
first
thirty
years
was
dragged
into
the
general
deterioration
common
to
all
human
things
the
prophecies
concerning
his
appearance
are
sometimes
of
an
equally
supernatural
kind
as
those
of
the
shîites
so
that
the
period
of
his
coming
has
passed
more
and
more
from
the
political
sphere
to
which
it
originally
belonged
into
that
of
eschatology
yet
naturally
it
is
easier
for
a
popular
leader
to
make
himself
regarded
as
the
orthodox
mahdî
than
to
play
the
part
of
the
returned
mohammedan
rulers
have
had
more
trouble
than
they
cared
for
with
candidates
for
the
dignity
of
the
mahdî
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
in
official
turkish
circles
there
is
a
tendency
to
simplify
the
messianic
expectation
by
giving
the
fullest
weight
to
this
traditional
saying
of
mohammed
there
is
no
mahdî
but
jesus
seeing
that
jesus
must
come
from
the
clouds
whereas
other
mahdîs
may
arise
from
human
society
in
the
orthodox
expectation
of
the
mahdi
the
moslim
theory
has
most
sharply
expressed
its
condemnation
of
the
later
political
history
of
islâm
in
the
course
of
the
first
century
after
the
hijrah
the
qorân
scholars
arose
and
these
in
turn
were
succeeded
by
the
men
of
tradition
and
by
the
canonists
of
later
times
these
learned
men
would
not
endure
any
interference
with
their
right
to
state
with
authority
what
islâm
demanded
of
its
leaders
they
laid
claim
to
an
interpretative
authority
concerning
the
divine
law
which
bordered
upon
supreme
legislative
power
their
agreement
ijmâ
was
that
of
the
infallible
community
but
just
as
beside
this
legislative
agreement
a
dogmatic
and
a
mystic
agreement
grew
up
in
the
same
way
there
was
a
separate
ijmâ
regarding
the
political
government
upon
which
the
canonists
could
exercise
only
an
indirect
influence
in
other
words
since
the
accession
of
the
omayyad
khalîfs
the
actual
authority
rested
in
the
hands
of
dynasties
and
under
the
abbasids
government
assumed
even
a
despotic
character
this
relation
between
the
governors
and
governed
originally
alien
to
islâm
was
not
changed
by
the
transference
of
the
actual
power
into
the
hands
of
and
officers
of
the
bodyguard
nor
yet
by
the
disintegration
of
the
empire
into
a
number
of
small
despotisms
the
investiture
of
which
by
the
khalîf
became
a
mere
formality
dynastic
and
political
questions
were
settled
in
a
comparatively
small
circle
by
court
intrigue
stratagems
and
force
and
the
canonists
like
the
people
were
bound
to
accept
the
results
politically
inclined
interpreters
of
the
law
might
try
to
justify
their
compulsory
assent
to
the
facts
by
theories
about
the
ijmâ
of
the
notables
residing
in
the
capital
who
took
the
urgent
decisions
about
the
succession
which
decisions
were
subsequently
confirmed
by
general
homage
to
the
new
prince
but
they
had
no
illusions
about
the
real
influence
of
the
community
upon
the
choice
of
its
leader
the
most
independent
scholars
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
that
the
course
which
political
affairs
had
taken
was
the
clearest
proof
of
the
moral
degeneration
which
had
set
in
and
they
pronounced
an
equally
bold
and
merciless
criticism
upon
the
government
in
all
its
departments
it
became
a
matter
of
course
that
a
pious
scholar
must
keep
himself
free
from
all
intercourse
with
state
officials
on
pain
of
losing
his
reputation
the
bridge
across
the
gulf
that
separated
the
spiritual
from
the
temporal
authorities
was
formed
by
those
state
officials
who
for
the
practice
of
their
office
needed
a
knowledge
of
the
divine
law
especially
the
it
was
originally
the
duty
of
these
judges
to
decide
all
legal
differences
between
mohammedans
or
men
of
other
creeds
under
mohammedan
protection
who
called
for
their
decision
the
actual
division
between
the
rulers
and
the
interpreters
of
the
law
caused
an
limitation
of
the
authority
of
the
the
laws
of
marriage
family
and
inheritance
remained
however
their
inalienable
territory
and
a
number
of
other
matters
in
which
too
great
a
religious
interest
was
involved
to
leave
them
to
the
caprice
of
the
governors
or
to
the
customary
law
outside
islâm
were
usually
included
but
as
the
were
appointed
by
the
governors
they
were
obliged
in
the
exercise
of
their
office
to
give
due
consideration
to
the
wishes
of
their
constituents
and
moreover
they
were
often
tainted
by
what
was
regarded
in
mohammedan
countries
as
inseparable
from
government
employment
bribery
on
this
account
the
canonists
although
it
was
from
their
ranks
that
the
officials
of
the
court
were
to
be
drawn
considered
no
words
too
strong
to
express
their
contempt
for
the
office
of
in
handbooks
of
the
law
of
all
times
the
of
our
time
are
represented
as
unscrupulous
beings
whose
unreliable
judgments
were
chiefly
dictated
by
their
greed
such
an
opinion
would
not
have
acquired
full
force
if
it
had
not
been
ascribed
to
mohammed
in
fact
the
prophet
according
to
a
tradition
had
said
that
out
of
three
two
are
destined
to
hell

of

could
not
be
prevailed
upon
by
imprisonment
or
castigation

innumerable
those
who
succumbed
to
the
temptation

the
respect
of
the
circle

which
they
had
belonged
i
once
witnessed
a
case
of
this
kind
and
the
former
friends
of
the
did
not
spare
him
their
bitter
reproaches
he
remarked
that
the
judge
whose
duty
it
was
to
maintain
the
divine
law
verily
held
a
noble
office
they
refuted
this
by
saying
that
this
defence
was
admissible
only
for
earlier
and
better
times
but
not
for
the
of
our
time
to
which
he
cuttingly
replied
and
ye

ancient

a

extent

in
the
eyes
of
the

of

such
glory

only
reflected
from

is

that

step
towards
the
possession

direction

about
ten
centuries

in
a
litigation
moreover
in
some
government
regulations
it
may
be
necessary
to
avoid
giving
offence
to
canonists
and
their
strict
disciples
in
such
cases
it
is
better
to
be
armed
beforehand
with
an
expert
opinion
than
to
be
exposed
to
dangerous
criticism
which
might
find
an
echo
in
a
wide
circle
the
official
must
therefore
be
somewhat
pliable
to
say
the
least
moreover
any
private
person
has
the
right
to
put
questions
to
the
state
and
the
court
is
bound
to
take
his
answers
into
account
in
its
decisions
in
this
way
the
have
absorbed
a
part
of
the
duties
of
the
and
so
their
office
is
dragged
along
in
the
degradation
that
the
unofficial
canonists
denounce
unweariedly
in
their
writings
and
in
their
teaching
the
way
in
which
the
most
important
places
are
filled
and
above
all
the
position
which
the
of
the
turkish
empire
the
holds
at
any
particular
period
may
well
serve
as
a
touchstone
of
the
influence
of
the
canonists
on
public
life
if
this
is
great
then
even
the
most
powerful
sultan
has
only
the
possibility
of
choice
between
a
few
great
scholars
put
forward
or
at
all
events
not
disapproved
of
by
their
own
guild
strengthened
by
public
opinion
if
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
keen
interest
felt
in
the
divine
law
then
the
temporal
rulers
can
do
pretty
much
what
they
like
with
these
representatives
of
the
canon
law
under
the
tyrannical
sway
of
sultan
the
was
little
more
than
a
tool
for
him
and
his
palace
clique
and
for
their
own
reasons
the
members
of
the
committee
of
union
and
progress
who
rule
at
constantinople
since
made
no
change
in
this
each
new
ministry
had
its
own
who
had
to
be
above
everything
a
faithful
upholder
of
the
constitutional
theory
held
by
the
committee
the
time
is
past
when
the
sultan
and
the
porte
in
framing
even
the
most
pressing
reform
must
first
anxiously
assure
themselves
of
the
position
that
the
tolbas
the
theologians
in
a
word
would
take
towards
it
and
of
the
influence
that
the
could
use
in
opposition
to
their
plans
the
political
authority
makes
its
deference
to
the
canonists
dependent
upon
their
strict
obedience
this
important
change
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
modernization
of
mohammedan
political
life
a
movement
through
which
the
expounders
of
a
law
which
has
endeavoured
to
remain
stationary
since
the
year
must
necessarily
get
into
straits
this
explains
also
why
the
religious
life
of
mohammedans
is
in
some
respects
freer
in
countries
under
authority
than
under
a
mohammedan
government
under
english
dutch
or
french
rule
the
are
less
interfered
with
in
their
teaching
the
in
their
recommendations
and
the
in
their
judgments
of
questions
of
marriage
and
inheritance
than
in
turkey
where
the
life
of
islâm
as
state
religion
lies
under
official
control
in
indirectly
governed
native
states
the
relation
of
mohammedan
church
and
state
may
much
more
resemble
that
in
turkey
and
this
is
sometimes
to
the
advantage
of
the
sovereign
ruler
under
the
direct
government
of
a
modern
state
the
mohammedan
group
is
treated
as
a
religious
community
whose
particular
life
has
just
the
same
claim
to
independence
as
that
of
other
denominations
the
only
justifiable
limitation
is
that
the
program
of
the
forcible
reduction
of
the
world
to
mohammedan
authority
be
kept
within
the
scholastic
walls
as
a
point
of
eschatology
and
not
considered
as
a
body
of
prescriptions
the
execution
of
which
must
be
prepared
the
extensive
political
program
of
islâm
developed
during
the
first
centuries
of
astounding
expansion
has
yet
not
prevented
millions
of
mohammedans
from
resigning
themselves
to
reversed
conditions
in
which
at
the
present
time
many
more
mohammedans
live
under
foreign
authority
than
under
their
own
the
acceptance
of
this
change
was
facilitated
by
the
historical
pessimism
of
islâm
which
makes
the
mind
prepared
for
every
sort
of
decay
and
by
the
true
moslim
habit
of
resignation
to
painful
experiences
not
through
fatalism
but
through
reverence
for
inscrutable
will
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
a
gross
mistake
to
imagine
that
the
idea
of
universal
conquest
may
be
considered
as
obliterated
this
is
the
case
with
the
intellectuals
and
with
many
practical
commercial
or
industrial
men
but
the
canonists
and
the
vulgar
still
live
in
the
illusion
of
the
days
of
islâm
greatness
the
legists
continue
to
ground
their
appreciation
of
every
actual
political
condition
on
the
law
of
the
holy
war
which
war
ought
never
to
be
allowed
to
cease
entirely
until
all
mankind
is
reduced
to
the
authority
of
islâm
the
heathen
by
conversion
the
adherents
of
acknowledged
scripture
by
submission
even
if
they
admit
the
improbability
of
this
at
present
they
are
comforted
and
encouraged
by
the
recollection
of
the
lengthy
period
of
humiliation
that
the
prophet
himself
had
to
suffer
before
allah
bestowed
victory
upon
his
arms
and
they
fervently
join
with
the
friday
preacher
when
he
pronounces
the
prayer
taken
from
the
qorân
and
lay
not
on
us
o
our
lord
that
for
which
we
have
not
strength
but
blot
out
our
sins
and
forgive
us
and
have
pity
upon
us
thou
art
our
master
grant
us
then
to
conquer
the
unbelievers
and
the
common
people
are
willingly
taught
by
the
canonists
and
feed
their
hope
of
better
days
upon
the
innumerable
legends
of
the
olden
time
and
the
equally
innumerable
apocalyptic
prophecies
about
the
future
the
political
blows
that
fall
upon
islâm
make
less
impression
upon
their
simple
minds
than
the
senseless
stories
about
the
power
of
the
sultan
of
stambul
that
would
instantly
be
revealed
if
he
were
not
surrounded
by
treacherous
servants
and
the
fantastic
tidings
of
the
miracles
that
allah
works
in
the
holy
cities
of
arabia
which
are
inaccessible
to
the
unfaithful
the
conception
of
the
khalifate
still
exercises
a
fascinating
influence
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
central
point
of
union
against
the
unfaithful
apart
from
the
mohammed
agents
amongst
the
arabian
tribes
the
khalifate
was
the
only
political
institution
which
arose
out
of
the
necessity
of
the
moslim
community
without
foreign
influence
it
rescued
islâm
from
threatening
destruction
and
it
led
the
faithful
to
conquest
no
wonder
that
in
historic
legend
the
first
four
occupiers
of
that
leadership
who
from
medina
accomplished
such
great
things
have
been
glorified
into
saints
and
are
held
up
to
all
the
following
generations
as
examples
to
put
them
to
shame
in
the
omayyads
the
ancient
aristocracy
of
mecca
came
to
the
helm
and
under
them
the
mohammedan
state
was
above
all
as
wellhausen
styled
it
the
arabian
empire
the
best
khalîfs
of
this
house
had
the
political
wisdom
to
give
the
governors
of
the
provinces
sufficient
independence
to
prevent
schism
and
to
secure
to
themselves
the
authority
in
important
matters
the
reaction
of
the
converts
against
the
suppression
of
their
own
culture
by
the
arabian
conquerors
found
support
in
the
opposition
parties
above
all
with
the
the
abbasids
cleverer
politicians
than
the
notoriously
unskillful
alids
made
use
of
the
alid
propaganda
to
secure
the
booty
to
themselves
at
the
right
moment
the
means
which
served
the
alids
for
the
establishment
only
of
an
invisible
dynasty
of
princes
who
died
as
martyrs
enabled
the
descendants
of
uncle
abbas
to
overthrow
the
omayyads
and
to
found
their
own
khalifate
at
bagdad
shining
with
the
brilliance
of
an
eastern
despotism
when
it
is
said
that
the
abbasid
khalifate
maintained
itself
from
till
the
mongol
storm
in
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
only
refers
to
external
appearance
after
a
brief
success
the
actual
power
of
these
khalîfs
was
transferred
to
the
hands
first
of
the
captains
of
their
bodyguard
then
of
whose
forcibly
acquired
powers
were
legalized
by
a
formal
investiture
in
the
same
way
the
large
provinces
developed
into
independent
kingdoms
whose
rulers
considered
the
from
bagdad
in
the
light
of
mere
ornaments
compared
to
this
irreparable
disintegration
of
the
empire
temporary
schisms
such
as
the
omayyad
khalifate
in
spain
the
fatimid
khalifate
in
egypt
and
here
and
there
an
independent
organization
of
the
khârijites
were
of
little
significance
it
seems
strange
that
the
moslim
peoples
although
the
theory
of
islâm
never
attributed
an
hereditary
character
to
the
khalifate
attached
so
high
a
value
to
the
abbasid
name
that
they
continued
unanimously
to
acknowledge
the
khalifate
of
bagdad
for
centuries
during
which
it
possessed
no
influence
but
the
idea
of
hereditary
rulers
was
deeply
rooted
in
most
of
the
peoples
converted
to
islâm
and
the
glorious
period
of
the
first
abbasids
so
strongly
impressed
itself
on
the
mind
of
the
vulgar
that
the
of
continuation
was
easily
taken
for
its
voidness
would
sooner
have
been
realized
if
lack
of
energy
had
not
prevented
the
later
abbasids
from
trying
to
recover
the
lost
power
by
the
sword
or
if
amongst
their
rivals
who
could
also
boast
of
a
popular
tradition
the
omayyads
or
still
more
the
alids
a
political
genius
had
succeeded
in
forming
a
powerful
opposition
but
the
sultans
who
ruled
the
various
states
did
not
want
to
place
all
that
they
possessed
in
the
balance
on
the
chance
of
gaining
the
title
of
khalîf
the
moslim
world
became
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
the
honoured
house
of
the
prophet
uncle
abbas
existed
for
the
purpose
of
lending
an
additional
glory
to
mohammedan
princes
by
a
diploma
even
after
the
destruction
of
bagdad
by
the
mongols
in
from
which
only
a
few
abbasids
escaped
alive
indian
princes
continued
to
value
visits
or
deeds
of
appointment
granted
them
by
some
begging
descendant
of
the
glorious
house
the
sultans
of
egypt
secured
this
luxury
permanently
for
themselves
by
taking
a
branch
of
the
family
under
their
protection
who
gave
the
glamour
of
their
approval
to
every
new
result
of
the
quarrels
of
succession
until
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
egypt
together
with
so
many
other
lands
was
swallowed
up
by
the
turkish
conqueror
these
new
rulers
who
added
the
byzantine
empire
to
islâm
who
with
egypt
brought
southern
and
western
arabia
with
the
holy
cities
also
under
their
authority
and
caused
all
the
neighbouring
princes
moslim
and
christian
alike
to
tremble
on
their
thrones
thought
it
was
time
to
abolish
the
senseless
survival
of
the
abbasid
glory
the
prestige
of
the
ottomans
was
as
great
as
that
of
the
khalifate
in
its
most
palmy
days
had
been
and
they
would
not
be
withheld
from
the
assumption
of
the
title
there
is
a
doubtful
tale
of
the
abdication
of
the
abbasids
in
their
favour
but
the
question
is
of
no
importance
the
ottomans
owed
their
khalifate
to
their
sword
and
this
was
the
only
argument
used
by
such
canonists
as
thought
it
worth
their
while
to
bring
such
an
incontestable
fact
into
reconciliation
with
the
law
this
was
not
strictly
necessary
as
they
had
been
accustomed
for
eight
centuries
to
acquiesce
in
all
sorts
of
unlawful
acts
which
history
demonstrated
to
be
the
will
of
allah
the
sense
of
the
tradition
that
established
descent
from
the
tribe
of
qoraish
as
necessary
for
the
highest
dignity
in
the
community
was
capable
of
being
weakened
by
explanation
and
even
without
that
the
leadership
of
the
irresistible
ottomans
was
of
more
value
to
islâm
than
the
chimerical
authority
of
a
powerless
qoraishite
in
our
own
time
you
can
hear
qoraishites
and
even
alids
warmly
defend
the
claims
of
the
turkish
sultans
to
the
khalifate
as
they
regard
these
as
the
only
moslim
princes
capable
of
championing
the
threatened
rights
of
islâm
even
the
sultans
of
stambul
could
not
think
of
restoring
the
authority
of
the
khalîf
over
the
whole
mohammedan
world
this
was
prevented
not
only
by
the
schismatic
kingdoms
khalifates
or
imâmates
like
persia
which
was
consolidated
just
in
the
sixteenth
century
by
the
unceasing
opposition
of
the
imâms
of
yemen
and
khârijite
principalities
at
the
extremities
of
the
mohammedan
world
besides
these
there
were
numerous
princes
in
central
asia
in
india
and
in
central
africa
whom
either
the
khalifate
had
always
been
obliged
to
leave
to
themselves
or
who
had
become
so
estranged
from
it
that
unless
they
felt
the
power
of
the
turkish
arms
they
preferred
to
remain
as
they
were
moreover
islâm
had
extended
itself
not
only
by
political
means
but
also
by
trade
and
colonization
into
countries
even
the
existence
of
which
was
hardly
known
in
the
political
centres
of
islâm
into
central
africa
or
the
far
east
of
asia
without
thinking
of
rivalling
the
abbasids
or
their
successors
some
of
the
princes
of
such
remote
kingdoms
the
sherîfs
of
morocco
assumed
the
title
of
commander
of
the
faithful
bestowed
upon
them
by
their
flatterers
today
there
are
petty
princes
in
east
india
under
dutch
sovereignty
who
decorate
themselves
with
the
title
of
khalîf
without
suspecting
that
they
are
thereby
guilty
of
a
sort
of
arrogant
blasphemy
such
exaggeration
is
not
supported
by
the
canonists
but
these
have
devised
a
theory
which
gives
a
foundation
to
the
authority
of
mohammedan
princes
who
never
had
a
real
or
fictitious
connection
with
a
real
or
fictitious
khalifate
authority
there
must
be
everywhere
and
under
all
circumstances
far
from
the
centre
this
should
be
exercised
according
to
them
by
the
one
who
has
been
able
to
gain
it
and
who
knows
how
to
hold
it
and
all
the
duties
are
laid
upon
him
which
in
a
normal
condition
would
be
discharged
by
the
khalîf
or
his
representative
for
this
kind
of
authority
the
legists
have
even
invented
a
special
name
which
means
actual
influence
the
authority
which
has
spontaneously
arisen
in
default
of
a
chief
who
in
one
form
or
another
can
be
considered
as
a
mandatary
of
the
khalifate
now
it
is
significant
that
many
of
those
mohammedan
governors
who
owe
their
existence
to
wild
growth
in
this
way
seek
especially
in
our
day
for
connection
with
the
khalifate
or
at
least
wish
to
be
regarded
as
naturally
connected
with
the
centre
the
same
is
true
of
such
whose
former
independence
or
adhesion
to
the
turkish
empire
has
been
replaced
by
the
sovereignty
of
a
western
state
even
amongst
the
moslim
peoples
placed
under
the
direct
government
of
european
states
a
tendency
prevails
to
be
considered
in
some
way
or
another
subjects
of
the
some
scholars
explain
this
phenomenon
by
the
spiritual
character
which
the
dignity
of
khalîf
is
supposed
to
have
acquired
under
the
later
abbasids
and
retained
since
that
time
until
the
ottoman
princes
combined
it
again
with
the
temporal
dignity
of
sultan
according
to
this
view
the
later
abbasids
were
a
sort
of
popes
of
islâm
while
the
temporal
authority
in
the
central
districts
as
well
as
in
the
subordinate
kingdoms
was
in
the
hands
of
various
sultans
the
sultans
of
constantinople
govern
then
under
this
name
as
much
territory
as
the
political
vicissitudes
allow
them
to
govern
the
turkish
empire
as
khalîfs
they
are
the
spiritual
heads
of
the
whole
of
sunnite
islâm
though
this
view
through
the
ignorance
of
european
statesmen
and
diplomatists
may
have
found
acceptance
even
by
some
of
the
great
powers
it
is
nevertheless
entirely
untrue
unless
by
spiritual
authority
we
are
to
understand
the
empty
appearance
of
worldly
authority
this
appearance
was
all
that
the
later
abbasids
retained
after
the
loss
of
their
temporal
power
spiritual
authority
of
any
kind
they
never
possessed
the
spiritual
authority
in
catholic
islâm
reposes
in
the
legists
who
in
this
respect
are
called
in
a
tradition
the
heirs
of
the
prophets
since
they
could
no
longer
regard
the
khalîfs
as
their
leaders
because
they
walked
in
worldly
ways
they
have
constituted
themselves
independently
beside
and
even
above
them
and
the
rulers
have
been
obliged
to
conclude
a
silent
contract
with
them
each
party
binding
itself
to
remain
within
its
own
limits
if
this
contract
be
observed
the
legists
not
only
are
ready
to
acknowledge
the
bad
rulers
of
the
world
but
even
to
preach
loyalty
towards
them
to
the
laity
the
most
supremely
popular
part
of
the
ideal
of
islâm
the
reduction
of
the
whole
world
to
moslim
authority
can
only
be
attempted
by
a
political
power
notwithstanding
the
destructive
criticism
of
all
moslim
princes
and
state
officials
by
the
canonists
it
was
only
from
them
that
they
could
expect
measures
to
uphold
and
extend
the
power
of
islâm
and
on
this
account
they
continually
cherished
the
ideal
of
the
khalifate
footnote
that
the
khalifate
is
in
no
way
to
be
compared
with
the
papacy
that
islâm
has
never
regarded
the
khalif
as
its
spiritual
head

pleased
to
find
the
same
views
expressed
by
hartmann
in
welt
des
bd
pp
in
the
first
centuries
it
was
the
duty
of
mohammedans
who
had
become
isolated
and
who
had
for
instance
been
conquered
by
unbelievers
to
do
hijrah
emigration
for
allah
sake
as
the
converted
arabs
had
done
in
mohammed
time
by
emigrating
to
medina
to
strengthen
the
ranks
of
the
faithful
this
soon
became
impracticable
so
that
the
legists
relaxed
the
prescription
by
concessions
to
the
force
of
necessity
resignation
was
thus
permitted
even
recommended
but
the
submission
to
was
always
to
be
regarded
as
temporary
and
abnormal
although
the
have
grown
larger
and
larger
the
eye
must
be
kept
fixed
upon
the
centre
the
khalifate
where
every
movement
towards
improvement
must
begin
a
western
state
that
admits
any
authority
of
a
khalîf
over
its
mohammedan
subjects
thus
acknowledges
the
authority
of
a
pope
of
the
moslim
church
but
in
simple
ignorance
is
feeding
political
programs
which
however
vain
always
have
the
power
of
stirring
mohammedan
masses
to
confusion
and
excitement
of
late
years
mohammedan
statesmen
in
their
intercourse
with
their
western
colleagues
are
glad
to
take
the
latter
point
of
view
and
in
discussion
accept
the
comparison
of
the
khalifate
with
the
papacy
because
they
are
aware
that
only
in
this
form
the
khalifate
can
be
made
acceptable
to
powers
who
have
mohammedan
subjects
but
for
these
subjects
the
khalif
is
then
their
true
prince
who
is
temporarily
hindered
in
the
exercise
of
his
government
but
whose
right
is
acknowledged
even
by
their
unbelieving
masters
in
yet
another
respect
the
canonists
need
the
aid
of
the
temporal
rulers
an
alert
police
is
counted
by
them
amongst
the
indispensable
means
of
securing
purity
of
doctrine
and
life
they
count
it
to
the
credit
of
princes
and
governors
that
they
enforced
by
violent
measures
seclusion
and
veiling
of
the
women
abstinence
from
drinking
and
that
they
punished
by
flogging
the
negligent
with
regard
to
fasting
or
attending
public
worship
the
political
decay
of
islâm
the
increasing
number
of
mohammedans
under
foreign
rule
appears
to
them
therefore
doubly
dangerous
as
they
have
little
faith
in
the
proof
of
islam
spiritual
goods
against
life
in
a
freedom
which
to
them
means
license
they
find
that
every
political
change
in
these
terrible
times
is
to
the
prejudice
of
islâm
one
moslim
people
after
another
losing
its
independent
existence
and
they
regard
it
as
equally
dangerous
that
moslim
princes
are
induced
to
accommodate
their
policy
and
government
to
new
international
ideas
of
individual
freedom
which
threaten
the
very
life
of
islâm
they
see
the
antagonism
to
all
foreign
ideas
formerly
considered
as
a
virtue
by
every
true
moslim
daily
losing
ground
and
they
are
filled
with
consternation
by
observing
in
their
own
ranks
the
contamination
of
modernist
ideas
the
brilliant
development
of
the
system
of
islâm
followed
the
establishment
of
its
material
power
so
the
rapid
decline
of
that
political
power
which
we
are
witnessing
makes
the
question
urgent
whether
islâm
has
a
spiritual
essence
able
to
survive
the
fall
of
such
a
material
support
it
is
certainly
not
the
canonists
who
will
detect
the
kernel
verily
we
are
god
and
verily
to
him
do
we
return
they
cry
in
helpless
amazement
and
their
consolation
is
in
the
old
prayer
and
lay
not
on
us
o
our
lord
that
for
which
we
have
no
strength
but
blot
out
our
sins
and
forgive
us
and
have
mercy
upon
us
thou
art
our
master
grant
us
then
to
conquer
the
unbelievers
iv
islâm
and
modern
thought
one
of
the
most
powerful
factors
of
religious
life
in
its
higher
forms
is
the
need
of
man
to
find
in
this
world
of
changing
things
an
imperishable
essence
to
separate
the
eternal
from
the
temporal
and
then
to
attach
himself
to
the
former
where
the
possibility
of
this
operation
is
despaired
of
there
may
arise
a
pessimism
which
finds
no
path
of
liberation
from
the
painful
vicissitudes
of
life
other
than
the
annihilation
of
individuality
a
firm
belief
in
a
sphere
of
life
freed
from
the
category
of
time
together
with
the
conviction
that
the
poetic
images
of
that
superior
world
current
among
mankind
are
images
and
nothing
else
is
likely
to
give
rise
to
definitions
of
the
absolute
by
purely
negative
attributes
and
to
mental
efforts
having
for
their
object
the
absorption
of
individual
existence
in
the
indescribable
infinite
generally
speaking
a
high
development
of
intellectual
life
especially
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
different
religious
systems
is
not
favourable
to
the
continuance
of
elaborate
conceptions
of
things
eternal
it
will
rather
increase
the
tendency
to
deprive
the
idea
of
the
transcendent
of
all
colour
and
definiteness
the
naïve
ideas
concerning
the
other
world
in
the
form
outlined
for
them
by
previous
generations
are
most
likely
to
remain
unchanged
in
a
religious
community
where
intellectual
intercourse
is
chiefly
limited
to
that
between
members
of
the
community
there
the
belief
is
fostered
that
things
most
appreciated
and
cherished
in
this
fading
world
by
mankind
will
have
an
enduring
existence
in
a
world
to
come
and
that
the
best
of
the
changing
phenomena
of
life
are
eternal
and
will
continue
free
from
that
change
which
is
the
principal
cause
of
human
misery
material
death
will
be
followed
by
awakening
to
a
purer
life
the
idealized
continuation
of
life
on
earth
and
for
this
reason
already
during
this
life
the
faithful
will
find
their
delight
in
those
things
which
they
know
to
be
everlasting
the
less
faith
is
submitted
to
the
control
of
intellect
the
more
numerous
the
objects
will
be
to
which
durable
value
is
attributed
this
is
true
for
different
individuals
as
well
as
for
one
religious
community
as
compared
to
another
there
are
christians
attached
only
to
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
mohammedans
attached
only
to
the
spirit
of
the
qorân
others
give
a
place
in
their
world
of
imperishable
things
to
a
particular
translation
of
the
bible
in
its
orthography
or
to
a
written
qorân
in
preference
to
a
printed
one
orthodox
judaism
and
orthodox
islâm
have
marked
with
the
stamp
of
eternity
codes
of
law
whose
influence
has
worked
as
an
impediment
to
the
life
of
the
adherents
of
those
religions
and
to
the
free
intercourse
of
other
people
with
them
as
well
so
the
roman
catholic
and
many
protestant
churches
have
in
their
organizations
and
in
their
dogmatic
systems
eternalized
institutions
and
ideas
whose
unchangeableness
has
come
to
retard
spiritual
progress
among
all
conservative
factors
of
human
life
religion
must
necessarily
be
the
most
conservative
were
it
only
because
its
aim
is
precisely
to
store
up
and
keep
under
its
guardianship
the
treasures
destined
for
eternity
to
which
we
have
alluded
now
every
new
period
in
the
history
of
civilization
obliges
a
religious
community
to
undertake
a
general
revision
of
the
contents
of
its
treasury
it
is
unavoidable
that
the
guardians
on
such
occasions
should
be
in
a
certain
measure
disappointed
for
they
find
that
some
of
the
goods
under
their
care
have
given
way
to
the
wasting
influence
of
time
whilst
others
are
in
a
state
which
gives
rise
to
serious
doubt
as
to
their
right
of
being
classified
with
lasting
treasures
in
reality
the
loss
is
only
an
apparent
one
far
from
impoverishing
the
community
it
enhances
the
solidity
of
its
possessions
what
remains
after
the
sifting
process
may
be
less
imposing
to
the
inexperienced
mind
gradually
the
consideration
gains
ground
that
what
has
been
rejected
was
nothing
but
useless
rubbish
which
had
been
wrongly
valued
sometimes
it
may
happen
that
the
general
movement
of
spiritual
progress
goes
almost
too
fast
so
that
one
revision
of
the
stores
of
religion
is
immediately
followed
by
another
then
dissension
is
likely
to
arise
among
the
adherents
of
a
religion
some
of
them
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
must
be
an
end
of
sifting
and
think
it
better
to
lock
up
the
treasuries
once
for
all
and
to
stop
the
dangerous
enquiries
whereas
others
begin
to
entertain
doubt
concerning
the
value
even
of
such
goods
as
do
not
yet
show
any
trace
of
decay
the
treasuries
of
islâm
are
excessively
full
of
rubbish
that
has
become
entirely
useless
and
for
nine
or
ten
centuries
they
have
not
been
submitted
to
a
revision
deserving
that
name
if
we
wish
to
understand
the
whole
or
any
important
part
of
the
system
of
islâm
we
must
always
begin
by
transporting
ourselves
into
the
third
or
fourth
century
of
the
hijrah
and
we
must
constantly
bear
in
mind
that
from
the
medina
period
downwards
islâm
has
always
been
considered
by
its
adherents
as
bound
to
regulate
all
the
details
of
their
life
by
means
of
prescriptions
emanating
directly
or
indirectly
from
god
and
therefore
incapable
of
being
reformed
at
the
time
when
these
prescriptions
acquired
their
definite
form
islâm
ruled
an
important
portion
of
the
world
it
considered
the
conquest
of
the
rest
as
being
only
a
question
of
time
and
therefore
felt
itself
quite
independent
in
the
development
of
its
law
there
was
little
reason
indeed
for
the
moslim
canonists
to
take
into
serious
account
the
interests
of
men
not
subject
to
mohammedan
authority
or
to
care
for
the
opinion
of
devotees
of
other
religions
islâm
might
act
and
did
almost
act
as
if
it
were
the
only
power
in
the
world
it
did
so
in
the
way
of
a
grand
seigneur
showing
a
great
amount
of
generosity
towards
its
subjugated
enemies
the
adherents
of
other
religions
were
or
would
become
subjects
of
the
commander
of
the
faithful
those
subjects
were
given
a
full
claim
on
mohammedan
protection
and
justice
while
the
independent
unbelievers
were
in
general
to
be
treated
as
enemies
until
in
submission
their
spiritual
life
deserved
not
even
so
much
attention
as
that
of
islâm
received
from
abbé
maracci
or
doctor
prideaux
the
false
doctrines
of
other
peoples
were
of
no
interest
whatever
in
themselves
and
since
there
was
no
fear
of
mohammedans
being
tainted
by
them
polemics
against
the
abrogated
religions
were
more
of
a
pastime
than
an
indispensable
part
of
theology
the
mohammedan
community
being
in
a
sense
allah
army
with
the
conquest
of
the
world
as
its
object
apostasy
deserved
the
punishment
of
death
in
no
lesser
degree
than
desertion
in
the
holy
war
nay
more
so
for
the
latter
might
be
the
effect
of
cowardice
whereas
the
former
was
an
act
of
inexcusable
treachery
in
the
attitude
of
islâm
towards
other
religions
there
is
hardly
one
feature
that
has
not
its
counterpart
in
the
practice
of
christian
states
during
the
middle
ages
the
great
difference
is
that
the
mohammedan
community
erected
this
medieval
custom
into
a
system
unalterable
like
all
prescriptions
based
on
its
infallible
agreement
ijmâ
here
lay
the
great
difficulty
when
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
placed
the
moslim
world
face
to
face
with
a
civilization
that
had
sprung
up
outside
its
borders
and
without
its
collaboration
that
was
from
a
spiritual
point
of
view
by
far
its
superior
and
at
the
same
time
possessed
of
sufficient
material
power
to
thrust
the
mohammedans
aside
wherever
they
seemed
to
be
an
impediment
in
its
way
a
long
series
of
the
most
painful
experiences
meaning
as
many
encroachments
upon
the
political
independence
of
mohammedan
territories
ended
by
teaching
islâm
that
it
had
definitely
to
change
its
lines
of
conduct
the
times
were
gone
when
relations
with
the
world
quite
different
from
those
foreseen
by
the
mediaeval
theory
might
be
considered
as
exceptions
to
the
rule
as
temporary
concessions
to
transitory
necessities
in
ever
wider
circles
a
thorough
revision
of
the
system
came
to
be
considered
as
a
requirement
of
the
time
the
fact
that
the
number
of
mohammedans
subject
to
foreign
rule
increased
enormously
and
by
far
surpassed
those
of
the
citizens
of
independent
mohammedan
states
made
the
problem
almost
as
interesting
to
western
nations
as
to
the
mohammedans
themselves
both
parties
are
almost
equally
concerned
in
the
question
whether
a
way
will
be
found
to
associate
the
moslim
world
to
modern
civilization
without
obliging
it
to
empty
its
spiritual
treasury
altogether
nobody
can
in
earnest
advocate
the
idea
of
leaving
the
solution
of
the
problem
to
rude
force
the
moslim
of
yore
going
through
the
world
with
the
qorân
in
one
hand
the
sword
in
the
other
giving
unbelievers
the
choice
between
conversion
or
death
is
a
creation
of
legendary
fancy
we
can
but
hope
that
modern
civilization
will
not
be
so
fanatical
against
moslims
as
the
latter
were
unjustly
said
to
have
been
during
the
period
of
their
power
if
the
modern
world
were
only
to
offer
the
mohammedans
the
choice
between
giving
up
at
once
the
traditions
of
their
ancestors
or
being
treated
as
barbarians
there
would
be
sure
to
ensue
a
struggle
as
bloody
as
has
ever
been
witnessed
in
the
world
it
is
worth
while
indeed
to
examine
the
system
of
islâm
from
this
special
point
of
view
and
to
try
to
find
the
terms
on
which
a
durable
might
be
established
between
islâm
and
modern
thought
the
purely
dogmatic
part
is
not
of
great
importance
some
of
us
may
admire
the
tenets
of
the
mohammedan
doctrine
others
may
as
heartily
despise
them
to
the
participation
of
mohammedans
in
the
civilized
life
of
our
days
they
are
as
innoxious
as
any
other
mediaeval
dogmatic
system
that
counts
its
millions
of
adherents
among
ourselves
the
details
of
mohammedan
dogmatics
have
long
ceased
to
interest
other
circles
than
those
of
professional
theologians
the
chief
points
arouse
no
discussion
and
the
deviations
in
popular
superstition
as
well
as
in
philosophical
thought
which
in
practice
meet
with
toleration
are
almost
unlimited
the
mohammedan
hell
claims
the
souls
of
all
heterodox
people
it
is
true
but
this
does
not
prevent
benevolent
intercourse
in
this
world
and
more
enlightened
moslims
are
inclined
to
enlarge
their
definition
of
the
word
faithful
so
as
to
include
their
friends
the
faith
in
a
mahdî
who
will
come
to
regenerate
the
world
is
apt
to
give
rise
to
revolutionary
movements
led
by
skilful
demagogues
pretending
to
act
as
the
guided
one
or
at
least
to
prepare
the
way
for
his
coming
most
of
the
european
powers
having
mohammedan
subjects
have
had
their
disagreeable
experiences
in
this
respect
but
moslim
chiefs
of
states
have
their
obvious
good
reasons
for
not
liking
such
movements
either
and
even
the
majority
of
ordinary
moslims
look
upon
candidates
for
with
suspicion
a
contented
prosperous
population
offers
such
candidates
little
chance
of
success
the
ritual
laws
of
islâm
are
a
heavy
burden
to
those
who
strictly
observe
them
a
man
who
has
to
perform
worship
five
times
a
day
in
a
state
of
ritual
purity
and
during
a
whole
month
in
a
year
has
to
abstain
from
food
and
drink
and
other
enjoyments
from
daybreak
until
sunset
is
at
a
disadvantage
when
he
has
to
enter
into
competition
with
for
getting
work
of
any
kind
but
since
most
of
the
moslims
have
become
subjects
of
foreign
powers
and
religious
police
has
been
practically
abolished
in
mohammedan
states
there
is
no
external
compulsion
the
ever
smaller
minority
of
strict
practisers
make
use
of
a
right
which
nobody
can

those

point
rightly
to
the

here
is
indeed
a
great
the
allowance
of
polygamy
up
to
a
maximum
of
four
wives
is
represented
by
mohammedan
authors
as
a
progress
if
compared
with
the
irregularity
of
pagan
arabia
and
even
with
the
acknowledgment
of
unlimited
polygamy
during
certain
periods
of
biblical
history
the
following
subtle
argument
is
to
be
found
in
some
schoolbooks
on
mohammedan
law
the
law
of
moses
was
exceedingly
benevolent
to
males
by
permitting
them
to
have
an
unlimited
number
of
wives
then
came
the
law
of
jesus
extreme
on
the
other
side
by
prescribing
monogamy
at
last
mohammed
restored
the
equilibrium
by
conceding
one
wife
to
each
of
the
four
humours
which
make
up
the
constitution
this
theory
which
leaves
the
question
what
the
woman
is
to
do
with
three
of
her
four
humours
undecided
will
hardly
find
fervent
advocates
among
the
present
canonists
at
the
same
time
very
few
of
them
would
venture
to
pronounce
their
preference
for
monogamy
in
a
general
way
polygamy
forming
a
part
of
the
law
that
is
to
prevail
according
to
the
infallible
agreement
of
the
community
until
the
day
of
resurrection
on
the
other
side
polygamy
although
is
far
from
being
by
the
majority
of
theologians
many
of
them
even
dissuade
men
capable
of
mastering
their
passion
from
marriage
in
general
and
censure
a
man
who
takes
two
wives
if
he
can
live
honestly
with
one
in
some
mohammedan
countries
social
circumstances
enforce
practical
monogamy
the
whole
question
lies
in
the
education
of
women
when
this
has
been
raised
to
a
higher
level
polygamy
will
necessarily
come
to
an
end
it
is
therefore
most
satisfactory
that
among
male
mohammedans
the
persuasion
of
the
necessity
of
a
solid
education
for
girls
is
daily
gaining
ground
this
year
a
young
egyptian
took
his
doctor
degree
at
the
paris
university
by
sustaining
a
dissertation
on
the
position
of
women
in
the
moslim
world
in
which
he
told
his
the
full
truth
concerning
this
rather
delicate
subject
if
social
evolution
takes
the
right
course
the
practice
of
polygamy
will
be
abolished
and
the
maintenance
of
its
lawfulness
in
canonical
works
will
mainly
be
a
survival
of
a
bygone
phase
of
development

looks
upon
the
endeavour
of
her

to
induce
her
to
partake
freely
in
public
life
as
a
want
of

it
makes
on
her
about
the

impression
as
that

in

society
would

from

encouraging
her
to

generally
frequented

to

of

is

to

and
in

consequence
free
intercourse
of
a
man
with
his
own
female
slaves
without
any
limitation
as
to
their
number
has
also
been
incorporated
into
the

and
therefore
has
been
placed
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
border
that
is
to
divide
eternal
things
from
temporal
ones
this
should
not
be
called
a
mediaeval
institution
the
most
civilized
nations
not
having
given
it
up
before
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
law
of
islâm
regulated
the
position
of
slaves
with
much
equity
and
there
is
a
great
body
of
testimony
from
people
who
have
spent
a
part
of
their
lives
among
mohammedan
nations
which
does
justice
to
the
benevolent
treatment
which
bondmen
generally
receive
from
their
masters
there
besides
that
we
are
bound
to
state
that
in
many
western
countries
or
countries
under
western
domination
whole
groups
of
the
population
live
under
circumstances
with
which
those
of
mohammedan
slavery
may
be
compared
to
advantage
the
only
legal
cause
of
slavery
in
islâm
is
prisonership
of
war
or
birth
from
slave
parents
the
captivity
of
enemies
of
islâm
has
not
at
all
necessarily
the
effect
of
enslaving
them
for
the
competent
authorities
may
dispose
of
them
in
any
other
way
also
in
the
way
prescribed
by
modern
international
law
or
custom
in
proportion
to
the
realization
of
the
political
ideal
of
islâm
the
number
of
its
enemies
must
diminish
and
the
possibilities
of
enslaving
men
must
consequently
decrease
setting
slaves
free
is
one
of
the
most
meritorious
pious
works
and
at
the
same
time
the
regular
atonement
for
certain
transgressions
of
the
sacred
law
so
according
to
mohammedan
principles
slavery
is
an
institution
destined
to
disappear
when
in
the
last
century
mohammedan
princes
signed
international
treaties
for
the
suppression
of
slavery
from
their
point
of
view
this
was
a
premature
anticipation
of
a
future
political
and
social
development
a
step
which
they
felt
obliged
to
take
out
of
consideration
for
the
great
powers
in
arabia
every
effort
of
the
turkish
government
to
put
such
international
agreements
into
execution
has
thus
far
given
rise
to
popular
sedition
against
the
ottoman
authority
therefore
the
promulgation
of
decrees
of
abolition
was
stopped
and
slavery
continued
to
exist
the
import
of
slaves
from
africa
has
in
fact
considerably
diminished
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
the
proportional
increase
of
the
liberty
which
the
natives
of
that
continent
enjoy
at
home
slavery
as
well
as
polygamy
is
in
a
certain
sense
to
mohammedans
a
sacred
institution
being
incorporated
in
their
holy
law
but
the
practice
of
neither
of
the
two
institutions
is
indispensable
to
the
integrity
of
islâm
all
those
antiquated
institutions
if
considered
from
the
point
of
view
of
modern
international
intercourse
are
only
a
trifle
in
comparison
with
the
legal
prescriptions
of
islâm
concerning
the
attitude
of
the
mohammedan
community
against
the
parts
of
the
world
not
yet
subject
to
its
authority
the
abode
of
war
as
they
are
technically
called
it
is
a
principal
duty
of
the
khalif
or
of
the
chiefs
considered
as
his
substitutes
in
different
countries
to
avail
themselves
of
every
opportunity
to
extend
by
force
the
dominion
of
allah
and
his
messenger
with
unsubdued
unbelievers
is
not
a
for
a
period
not
exceeding
ten
years
may
be
concluded
if
the
interest
of
islâm
requires
it
the
chapters
of
the
mohammedan
law
on
holy
war
and
on
the
conditions
on
which
the
submission
of
the
adherents
of
tolerated
religions
is
to
be
accepted
seem
to
be
a
foolish
pretension
if
we
consider
them
by
the
light
of
the
actual
division
of
political
power
in
the
world
but
here
too
to
understand
is
better
than
to
ridicule
in
the
centuries
in
which
the
system
of
islâm
acquired
its
maturity
such
an
aspiration
after
universal
dominion
was
not
at
all
ridiculous
and
many
christian
states
of
the
time
were
far
from
reaching
the
mohammedan
standard
of
tolerance
against
heterodox
creeds
the
delicate
point
is
this
that
the
petrification
or
at
least
the
process
of
stiffening
that
has
attacked
the
whole
spiritual
life
of
islâm
since
about
makes
its
accommodation
to
the
requirements
of
modern
intercourse
a
most
difficult
problem
but
it
is
not
only
the
mohammedan
community
that
needed
misfortune
and
humiliation
before
it
was
able
to
appreciate
liberty
of
conscience
or
that
took
a
long
time
to
digest
those
painful
lessons
of
history
there
are
still
christian
churches
which
accept
religious
liberty
only
in
circumstances
that
make
supreme
authority
unattainable
to
them
and
which
elsewhere
would
not
disdain
the
use
of
material
means
to
subdue
spirits
to
what
they
consider
the
absolute
truth
to
judge
such
things
with
equity
we
must
remember
that
every
man
possessed
of
a
firm
conviction
of
any
kind
is
more
or
less
a
missionary
and
the
belief
in
the
possibility
of
winning
souls
by
violence
has
many
adherents
everywhere
one
of
my
friends
among
the
state
officials
who
wished
to
persuade
me
of
the
perfect
religious
tolerance
of
turkey
of
today
concluded
his
argument
by
the
following
reflection
formerly
men
used
to
behead
each
other
for
difference
of
opinion
about
the
hereafter
nowadays
praise
be
to
allah
we
are
permitted
to
believe
what
we
like
but
people
continue
to
kill
each
other
for
political
or
social
dissension
that
is
most
pitiful
indeed
for
the
weapons
in
use
being
more
terrible
and
more
costly
than
before
mankind
lacks
the
peace
necessary
to
enjoy
the
liberty
of
conscience
it
has
acquired
the
truthful
irony
of
these
words
need
not
prevent
us
from
considering
the
independence
of
spiritual
life
and
the
liberation
of
its
development
from
material
compulsion
as
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
of
our
civilization
we
feel
urged
by
missionary
zeal
of
the
better
kind
to
make
the
mohammedan
world
partake
in
its
enjoyment
in
the
turkish
empire
in
egypt
in
many
mohammedan
countries
under
western
control
the
progressive
elements
of
moslim
society
spontaneously
meet
us
but
behind
them
are
the
millions
who
firmly
adhere
to
the
old
superstition
and
are
supported
by
the
canonists
those
faithful
guardians
of
what
the
infallible
community
declared
almost
one
thousand
years
ago
to
be
the
doctrine
and
rule
of
life
for
all
centuries
to
come
will
it
ever
prove
possible
to
move
in
one
direction
a
body
composed
of
such
different
elements
or
will
this
body
be
torn
in
pieces
when
the
movement
has
become
irresistible
we
have
more
than
once
pointed
to
the
catholic
character
of
orthodox
islâm
in
fact
the
diversity
of
spiritual
tendencies
is
not
less
in
the
moslim
world
than
within
the
sphere
of
christian
influence
but
in
islâm
apart
from
the
political
schisms
of
the
first
centuries
that
diversity
has
not
given
rise
to
anything
like
the
division
of
christianity
into
sects
there
is
a
prophetic
saying
related
by
tradition
which
later
generations
have
generally
misunderstood
to
mean
that
the
mohammedan
community
would
be
split
into
different
sects
moslim
heresiologists
have
been
induced
by
this
prediction
to
fill
up
their
lists
of
numbers
with
all
sorts
of
names
many
of
which
represent
nothing
but
individual
opinions
of
more
or
less
famous
scholars
on
subordinate
points
of
doctrine
or
law
almost
per
cent
of
all
mohammedans
are
indeed
bound
together
by
a
spiritual
unity
that
may
be
compared
with
that
of
the
roman
catholic
church
within
whose
walls
there
is
also
room
for
religious
and
intellectual
life
of
very
different
origin
and
tendency
in
the
sense
of
broadness
islâm
has
this
advantage
that
there
is
no
generally
recognized
palpable
authority
able
to
stop
now
and
then
the
progress
of
modernism
or
similar
deviations
from
the
trodden
path
with
an
imperative
halt
there
is
no
lack
indeed
of
mutual
accusation
of
heresy
but
this
remains
without
serious
consequences
because
of
the
absence
of
a
high
ecclesiastical
council
competent
to
decide
once
for
all
the
political
authorities
who
might
be
induced
by
fanatical
theologians
to
settle
disputes
by
violent
inquisitorial
means
have
been
prevented
for
a
long
time
from
such
interference
by
more
pressing
affairs
a
knowledge
alone
of
the
orthodox
system
of
islâm
however
complete
would
give
us
an
even
more
inadequate
idea
of
the
actual
world
of
catholic
islâm
than
the
notion
we
should
acquire
of
the
spiritual
currents
moving
the
roman
catholic
world
by
merely
studying
the
dogma
and
the
canonical
law
of
the
church
of
rome
nevertheless
the
unity
of
islamic
thought
is
by
no
means
a
word
void
of
sense
the
ideas
of
mohammedan
philosophers
borrowed
for
a
great
part
from
neoplatonism
the
pantheism
and
the
emanation
theory
of
mohammedan
mystics
are
certainly
still
further
distant
from
the
simplicity
of
qorânic
religion
than
the
orthodox
dogmatics
but
all
those
conceptions
alike
show
indubitable
marks
of
having
grown
up
on
mohammedan
soil
in
the
works
even
of
those
mystics
who
efface
the
limits
between
things
human
and
divine
who
put
judaism
christianity
and
paganism
on
the
same
line
with
the
revelation
of
mohammed
and
who
are
therefore
duly
anathematized
by
the
whole
orthodox
world
almost
every
page
testifies
to
the
relation
of
the
ideas
enounced
with
mohammedan
civilization
most
of
the
treatises
on
science
arts
or
law
written
by
egyptian
students
for
their
degree
at
european
universities
make
no
exception
to
this
rule
the
manner
in
which
these
authors
conceive
the
problems
and
strive
for
their
solution
is
in
a
certain
sense
in
the
broadest
sense
of
course
mohammedan
thus
if
we
speak
of
mohammedan
thought
civilization
spirit
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
the
great
importance
of
the
system
which
almost
unchanged
has
been
delivered
for
about
one
thousand
years
by
one
generation
of
doctors
of
islâm
to
the
other
although
it
has
become
ever
more
unfit
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
community
on
whose
infallible
agreement
it
rests
but
at
the
same
time
we
ought
to
consider
that
beside
the
agreement
of
canonists
of
dogmatists
and
of
mystics
there
are
a
dozen
more
agreements
social
political
popular
philosophical
and
so
on
and
that
however
great
may
be
the
influence
of
the
doctors
who
pretend
to
monopolize
infallibility
for
the
opinions
on
which
they
agree
the
real
agreement
of
islâm
is
the
least
common
measure
of
all
the
agreements
of
the
groups
which
make
up
the
community
it
would
require
a
large
volume
to
review
the
principal
currents
of
thought
pervading
the
moslim
world
in
our
day
but
a
general
notion
may
be
acquired
by
a
rapid
glance
at
two
centres
geographically
not
far
distant
from
each
other
but
situated
at
the
opposite
poles
of
spiritual
life
mecca
and
cairo
in
mecca
yearly
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
moslims
from
all
parts
of
the
world
come
together
to
celebrate
the
hajj
that
curious
set
of
ceremonies
of
pagan
arabian
origin
which
mohammed
has
incorporated
into
his
religion
a
durable
survival
that
in
islâm
makes
an
impression
as
singular
as
that
of
jumping
processions
in
christianity
mohammed
never
could
have
foreseen
that
the
consequence
of
his
concession
to
deeply
rooted
arabic
custom
would
be
that
in
future
centuries
chinese
malays
indians
tatars
turks
egyptians
berbers
and
negroes
would
meet
on
this
barren
desert
soil
and
carry
home
profound
impressions
of
the
international
significance
of
islâm
still
more
important
is
the
fact
that
from
all
those
countries
young
people
settle
here
for
years
to
devote
themselves
to
the
study
of
the
sacred
science
from
the
second
to
the
tenth
month
of
the
mohammedan
lunar
year
the
haram
the
mosque
which
is
an
open
place
with
the
in
its
midst
and
surrounded
by
large
roofed
galleries
has
free
room
enough
between
the
hours
of
public
service
to
allow
of
a
dozen
or
more
circles
of
students
sitting
down
around
their
professors
to
listen
to
as
many
lectures
on
different
subjects
generally
delivered
in
a
very
loud
voice
arabic
grammar
and
style
prosody
logic
and
other
preparatory
branches
the
sacred
trivium
canonic
law
dogmatics
and
mysticism
and
for
the
more
advanced
exegesis
of
qorân
and
tradition
and
some
other
branches
of
supererogation
are
taught
here
in
the
mediaeval
way
from
mediaeval
or
from
more
modern
compilations
reproducing
their
contents
and
completing
them
more
or
less
by
treating
modern
questions
according
to
the
same
methods
it
is
now
almost
thirty
years
since
i
lived
the
life
of
a
meccan
student
during
one
university
year
after
having
become
familiar
with
the
matter
taught
by
the
professors
of
the
temple
of
mecca
the
haram
by
privately
studying
it
so
that
i
could
freely
use
all
my
time
in
observing
the
mentality
of
people
learning
those
things
not
for
curiosity
but
in
order
to
acquire
the
only
true
direction
for
their
life
in
this
world
and
the
salvation
of
their
souls
in
the
world
to
come
for
a
modern
man
there
could
hardly
be
a
better
opportunity
imagined
for
getting
a
true
vision
of
the
middle
ages
than
is
offered
to
the
orientalist
by
a
few
months
stay
in
the
holy
city
of
islâm
in
countries
like
china
tibet
or
india
there
are
spheres
of
spiritual
life
which
present
to
us
still
more
interesting
material
for
comparative
study
of
religions
than
that
of
mecca
because
they
are
so
much
more
distant
from
our
own
but
just
on
that
account
the
western
student
would
not
be
able
to
adapt
his
mind
to
their
mental
atmospheres
as
he
may
do
in
mecca
no
one
would
think
for
one
moment
of
considering
confucianism
hinduism
or
buddhism
as
specially
akin
to
christianity
whereas
islâm
has
been
treated
by
some
historians
of
the
christian
church
as
belonging
to
the
heretical
offspring
of
the
christian
religion
in
fact
if
we
are
able
to
abstract
ourselves
for
a
moment
from
all
dogmatic
prejudice
and
to
become
a
meccan
with
the
meccans
one
of
the
neighbours
of
allah
as
they
call
themselves
we
feel
in
their
temple
the
haram
as
if
we
were
conversing
with
our
ancestors
of
five
or
six
centuries
ago
here
scholasticism
with
a
rabbinical
tint
forms
the
great
attraction
to
the
minds
of
thousands
of
intellectually
highly
gifted
men
of
all
ages
the
most
important
lectures
are
delivered
during
the
forenoon
and
in
the
evening
a
walk
at
one
of
those
hours
through
the
square
and
under
the
colonnades
of
the
mosque
with
ears
opened
to
all
sides
will
enable
you
to
get
a
general
idea
of
the
objects
of
mental
exercise
of
this
international
assembly
here
you
may
find
a
sheikh
of
pure
arab
descent
explaining
to
his
audience
composed
of
white
syrians
or
circassians
of
brown
and
yellow
abyssinians
and
egyptians
of
negroes
chinese
and
malays
the
probable
and
improbable
legal
consequences
of
marriage
contracts
not
excepting
those
between
men
and
genii
there
a
negro
scholar
is
explaining
the
ontological
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
creator
and
the
logical
necessity
of
his
having
twenty
qualities
inseparable
from
but
not
identical
with
his
essence
in
the
midst
of
another
circle
a
learned
of
indeterminably
mixed
extraction
demonstrates
to
his
pupils
from
the
standard
work
of
the
absolute
vanity
of
law
and
doctrine
to
those
whose
hearts
are
not
purified
from
every
attachment
to
the
world
most
of
the
branches
of
mohammedan
learning
are
represented
within
the
walls
of
this
temple
by
more
or
less
famous
scholars
and
still
there
are
a
great
number
of
private
lectures
delivered
at
home
by
professors
who
do
not
like
to
be
disturbed
by
the
unavoidable
noise
in
the
mosque
which
during
the
whole
day
serves
as
a
meeting
place
for
friends
or
business
men
as
an
exercise
hall
for
qorân
reciters
and
even
as
a
passage
for
people
going
from
one
part
of
the
town
to
the
other
in
order
to
complete
your
mediaeval
dream
with
a
scene
from
daily
life
you
have
only
to
leave
the
mosque
by
the
bâb
dereybah
one
of
its
gates
where
you
may
see
human
merchandise
exhibited
for
sale
by
the
and
then
to
have
a
glance
outside
the
wall
at
a
camel
caravan
bringing
firewood
and
vegetables
into
the
town
led
by
beduins
whose
outward
appearance
has
as
little
changed
as
their
minds
since
the
day
when
mohammed
began
here
to
preach
the
word
of
allah
to
the
greater
part
of
the
world
represented
by
this
international
exhibition
of
islâm
as
a
modern
musulman
writer
calls
it
our
modern
world
with
all
its
problems
its
emotions
its
learning
and
science
hardly
exists
on
the
other
hand
the
average
modern
man
does
not
understand
much
more
of
the
mental
life
of
the
two
hundred
millions
to
whom
the
barren
mecca
has
become
the
great
centre
in
former
days
other
centres
were
much
more
important
although
mecca
has
always
been
the
goal
of
pilgrimage
and
the
cherished
abode
of
many
learned
men
many
capitals
of
islâm
offered
the
students
an
easier
life
and
better
accommodations
for
their
studies
while
in
mecca
four
months
of
the
year
are
devoted
to
the
foreign
guests
of
allah
by
attending
to
whose
various
needs
all
meccans
gain
their
livelihood
for
centuries
cairo
has
stood
unrivalled
as
a
seat
of
mohammedan
learning
of
every
kind
and
even
now
the
uaram
of
mecca
is
not
to
be
compared
to
the
as
regards
the
number
and
the
fame
of
its
professors
and
the
variety
of
branches
cultivated
in
the
last
however
the
ancient
repute
of
the
egyptian
metropolis
has
suffered
a
good
deal
from
the
enormous
increase
of
european
influence
in
the
land
of
the
pharaohs
the
effects
of
which
have
made
themselves
felt
even
in
the
azhar
modern
programs
and
methods
of
instruction
have
been
adopted
and
what
is
still
worse
modernism
itself
favoured
by
the
late
muftî
muhammed
abduh
has
made
its
entrance
into
the
sacred
which
until
a
few
years
ago
seemed
inaccessible
to
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
decrees
of
the
infallible
agreement
of
the
community
strenuous
efforts
have
been
made
by
eminent
scholars
to
liberate
islâm
from
the
chains
of
the
authority
of
the
past
ages
on
the
basis
of
independent
interpretation
of
the
qorân
not
in
the
way
of
the
wahhâbî
reformers
who
tried
a
century
before
to
restore
the
institutions
of
mohammed
time
in
their
original
purity
but
on
the
contrary
with
the
object
of
adapting
islâm
by
all
means
in
their
power
to
the
requirements
of
modern
life
official
protection
of
the
bold
innovators
prevented
their
conservative
opponents
from
casting
them
out
of
the
azhar
but
the
assent
to
their
doctrines
was
more
enthusiastic
outside
its
walls
than
inside
the
ever
more
numerous
adherents
of
modern
thought
in
egypt
do
not
generally
proceed
from
the
ranks
of
the
azhar
students
nor
do
they
generally
care
very
much
in
their
later
life
for
reforming
the
methods
prevailing
there
although
they
may
be
inclined
to
applaud
the
efforts
of
the
modernists
to
the
intellectuals
of
the
higher
classes
the
azhar
has
ceased
to
offer
great
attraction
if
it
were
not
for
the
important
funds
for
the
benefit
of
professors
and
students
the
numbers
of
both
classes
would
have
diminished
much
more
than
is
already
the
case
and
the
faithful
cultivators
of
mediaeval
mohammedan
science
would
prefer
to
live
in
mecca
free
from
western
influence
and
control
even
as
it
is
the
predilection
of
foreign
students
of
law
and
theology
is
turning
more
and
more
towards
mecca
as
one
of
the
numerous
interesting
specimens
of
the
mental
development
effected
in
egypt
in
the
last
years
i
may
mention
a
book
that
appeared
in
cairo
two
years
ago
containing
a
description
of
the
present
pilgrimage
to
mecca
and
medina
performed
two
years
before
the
author
evidently
possesses
a
good
deal
of
the
scholastic
learning
to
be
gathered
in
the
azhar
and
no
european
erudition
in
the
stricter
sense
of
the
word
in
an
introductory
chapter
he
gives
a
summary
of
the
geography
and
history
of
the
arabian
peninsula
describes
the
hijâz
in
a
more
detailed
manner
and
in
his
very
elaborate
account
of
the
journey
on
which
he
accompanied
his
princely
master
the
topography
of
the
holy
cities
the
peculiarities
of
their
inhabitants
and
of
the
foreign
visitors
the
political
institutions
and
the
social
conditions
are
treated
almost
as
fully
and
accurately
as
we
could
desire
from
the
hand
of
the
most
accomplished
european
scholar
the
work
is
illustrated
by
good
maps
and
plans
and
by
a
great
number
of
excellent
photographs
expressly
taken
for
this
purpose
by
the
khedive
order
the
author
intersperses
his
account
with
many
witty
remarks
as
well
as
serious
reflections
on
religious
and
political
topics
thus
making
it
very
readable
to
those
of
us
who
are
familiar
with
the
arabic
language
he
adorns
his
description
of
the
holy
places
and
of
the
with
the
unctuous
phrases
used
in
handbooks
for
the
hajji
and
he
does
not
disturb
the
mind
of
the
pious
reader
by
any
historical
criticism
of
the
traditions
connected
with
the
house
of
allah
the
black
stone
and
the
other
sanctuaries
but
he
loses
no
opportunity
to
show
his
dislike
of
all
superstition
sometimes
as
if
to
prevent
western
readers
from
indulging
in
mockery
he
compares
meccan
rites
or
customs
with
superstitious
practices
current
amongst
jews
or
christians
of
today
footnote
by
muhammed
labib
edition
cairo
hijrah
this
book
at
whose
contents
many
a
meccan
scholar
of
the
old
style
will
shake
his
head
and
exclaim
we
seek
refuge
near
allah
from
satan
the
cursed
has
been
adopted
by
the
egyptian
department
of
public
instruction
as
a
for
the
schools
what
surprised
me
more
than
anything
else
was
the
author
quoting
as
his
predecessors
in
the
description
of
mecca
and
medina
burckhardt
burton
and
myself
and
his
sending
me
although
personally
unacquainted
with
him
a
presentation
copy
with
a
flattering
dedication
this
author
and
his
book
would
have
been
impossible
in
the
moslim
world
not
more
than
thirty
years
ago
in
egypt
such
a
man
is
nowadays
already
considered
as
one
of
those
more
conservative
moderns
who
prefer
the
rationalistic
explanation
of
the
azhar
lore
to
putting
it
aside
altogether
within
the
azhar
his
book
is
sure
to
meet
with
hearty
approval
from
the
followers
of
muhammed
abduh
but
not
less
hearty
disapproval
from
the
opponents
of
modernism
who
make
up
the
majority
of
the
professors
as
well
as
of
the
students
in
these
very
last
years
a
new
progress
of
modern
thought
has
manifested
itself
in
cairo
in
the
foundation
under
the
auspices
of
pasha
an
uncle
of
the
present
khedive
of
the
egyptian
university
cairo
has
had
for
a
long
time
its
schools
of
medicine
and
law
which
could
be
turned
easily
into
university
faculties
therefore
the
founders
of
the
university
thought
it
urgent
to
establish
a
faculty
of
arts
and
if
this
proved
a
success
to
add
a
faculty
of
science
in
the
meantime
gifted
young
men
were
granted
subsidies
to
learn
at
european
universities
what
they
needed
to
know
to
be
the
professors
of
a
coming
generation
and
for
the
present
christian
as
well
as
mohammedan
natives
of
egypt
and
european
scholars
living
in
the
country
were
appointed
as
lecturers
professors
being
borrowed
from
the
universities
of
europe
to
deliver
lectures
in
arabic
on
different
subjects
chosen
more
or
less
at
random
before
an
audience
little
prepared
to
digest
the
lessons
offered
to
them
the
rather
hasty
start
and
the
lack
of
a
scheme
have
made
the
egyptian
university
a
subject
of
severe
criticism
nevertheless
its
foundation
is
an
unmistakable
expression
of
the
desire
of
intellectual
egypt
to
translate
modern
thought
into
its
own
language
to
adapt
modern
higher
instruction
to
its
own
needs
this
same
aim
is
pursued
in
a
perhaps
more
efficacious
manner
by
the
hundreds
of
egyptian
students
of
law
science
and
medicine
at
french
english
and
some
other
european
universities
the
turks
could
not
freely
follow
such
examples
before
the
revolution
of
but
they
have
shown
since
that
time
that
their
abstention
was
not
voluntary
england
france
holland
and
other
countries
governing
mohammedan
populations
are
all
endeavouring
to
find
the
right
way
to
incorporate
their
mohammedan
subjects
into
their
own
civilization
fully
recognizing
that
it
was
the
material
covetousness
of
past
generations
that
submitted
those
nations
to
their
rule
the
colonial
powers
consider
it
their
duty
now
to
secure
for
them
in
international
intercourse
the
place
which
their
natural
talent
enables
them
to
occupy
the
question
whether
it
is
better
simply
to
leave
the
moslims
to
islâm
as
it
was
for
centuries
is
no
longer
an
object
of
serious
discussion
the
reforming
process
being
at
work
everywhere
in
some
parts
with
surprising
rapidity
we
can
only
try
to
prognosticate
the
solution
which
the
near
future
reserves
for
the
problem
how
the
moslim
world
is
to
be
associated
with
modern
thought
in
this
problem
the
whole
civilized
world
and
the
whole
world
of
islâm
are
concerned
the
ethnic
difference
between
indians
malays
may
necessitate
a
difference
of
method
in
detail
the
islâm
problem
lies
at
the
basis
of
the
question
for
all
of
them
on
the
other
hand
the
future
development
of
islâm
does
not
only
interest
countries
with
mohammedan
dominions
it
claims
as
well
the
attention
of
all
the
nations
partaking
in
the
international
exchange
of
material
and
spiritual
goods
this
would
be
more
generally
recognized
if
some
knowledge
of
islâm
were
more
widely
spread
amongst
ourselves
if
it
were
better
realized
that
islâm
is
next
akin
to
christianity
it
is
the
christian
mission
that
shows
the
deepest
consciousness
of
this
state
of
things
and
the
greatest
activity
in
promoting
an
association
of
mohammedan
thought
with
that
of
western
nations
the
solid
mass
of
experience
due
to
the
efforts
of
numerous
missionaries
is
not
of
an
encouraging
nature
there
is
no
reasonable
hope
of
the
conversion
of
important
numbers
of
mohammedans
to
any
christian
denomination
missionary
societies
have
therefore
given
up
the
old
fruitless
proselytizing
methods
and
have
turned
to
social
improvement
in
the
way
of
education
medical
treatment
and
the
like
it
can
not
be
denied
that
what
they
want
above
all
to
bring
to
mohammedans
is
just
what
these
most
energetically
decline
to
accept
on
the
other
hand
the
advocates
of
a
purely
civilizing
mission
are
bound
to
acknowledge
that
but
for
rare
exceptions
the
desire
of
incorporating
mohammedan
nations
into
our
world
of
thought
does
not
rouse
the
devoted
enthusiasm
inspired
by
the
vocation
of
propagating
a
religious
belief
the
ardour
displayed
by
some
missionaries
in
establishing
in
the
dâr
christian
centres
from
which
they
distribute
to
the
mohammedans
those
elements
of
our
civilization
which
are
acceptable
to
them
deserves
cordial
praise
the
more
so
because
they
themselves
entertain
but
little
hope
of
attaining
their
ultimate
aim
of
conversion
mohammedans
who
take
any
interest
in
christianity
are
taught
by
their
own
teachers
that
the
revelation
of
jesus
after
having
suffered
serious
corruption
by
the
christians
themselves
has
been
purified
and
restored
to
its
original
simplicity
by
mohammed
and
are
therefore
inaccessible
to
missionary
arguments
nay
amongst
uncivilized
pagans
the
lay
mission
of
islâm
is
the
most
formidable
competitor
of
clerical
propagation
of
the
christian
faith
people
who
take
no
active
part
in
missionary
work
are
not
competent
to
dissuade
christian
missionaries
from
continuing
their
seemingly
hopeless
labour
among
mohammedans
nor
to
prescribe
to
them
the
methods
they
are
to
adopt
their
full
autonomy
is
to
be
respected
but
all
agree
that
mohammedans
disinclined
as
they
are
to
reject
their
own
traditions
of
thirteen
centuries
and
to
adopt
a
new
religious
faith
become
ever
better
disposed
to
associate
their
intellectual
social
and
political
life
with
that
of
the
modern
world
here
lies
the
starting
point
for
two
divisions
of
mankind
which
for
centuries
have
lived
their
own
lives
separately
in
mutual
misunderstanding
from
which
to
pursue
their
way
arm
in
arm
to
the
greater
advantage
of
both
we
must
leave
it
to
the
mohammedans
themselves
to
reconcile
the
new
ideas
which
they
want
with
the
old
ones
with
which
they
can
not
dispense
but
we
can
help
them
in
adapting
their
educational
system
to
modern
requirements
and
give
them
a
good
example
by
rejecting
the
detestable
identification
of
power
and
right
in
politics
which
lies
at
the
basis
of
their
own
canonical
law
on
holy
war
as
well
as
at
the
basis
of
the
political
practice
of
modern
western
states
this
is
a
work
in
which
we
all
may
collaborate
whatever
our
own
religious
conviction
may
be
the
principal
condition
for
a
fruitful
friendly
intercourse
of
this
kind
is
that
we
make
the
moslim
world
an
object
of
continual
serious
investigation
in
our
intellectual
centres
having
spent
a
good
deal
of
my
life
in
seeking
for
the
right
method
of
associating
with
modern
thought
the
millions
of
mohammedans
whom
history
has
placed
under
the
guardianship
of
my
own
country
i
could
not
help
drawing
some
practical
conclusions
from
the
lessons
of
history
which
i
have
tried
to
reduce
to
their
most
abridged
form
there
is
no
lack
of
pessimists
whose
wisdom
has
found
its
poetic
form
in
the
words
of
kipling
east
is
east
and
west
is
west
and
never
the
twain
shall
meet
to
me
with
regard
to
the
moslim
world
these
words
seem
almost
a
blasphemy
the
experience
acquired
by
adapting
myself
to
the
peculiarities
of
mohammedans
and
by
daily
conversation
with
them
for
about
twenty
years
has
impressed
me
with
the
firm
conviction
that
between
islâm
and
the
modern
world
an
understanding
to
be
attained
and
that
no
period
has
offered
a
better
chance
of
furthering
it
than
the
time
in
which
we
are
living
to
kipling
poetical
despair
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
prefer
the
words
of
a
modern
hindu
writer
the
pity
is
that
men
led
astray
by
adventitious
differences
miss
the
essential
resemblances

important
of
